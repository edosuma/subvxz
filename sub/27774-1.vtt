01:10.983 --> 01:13.551
Your cousin, he's so hot.

01:13.595 --> 01:16.163
His voice is
liquid panty remover.

01:16.206 --> 01:18.208
I can confirm that is not true.

01:31.961 --> 01:33.441
Y'all give it up for DJ Twist.

01:40.230 --> 01:41.362
Hey!

01:42.145 --> 01:44.191
Congrats,
your new album is amazing!

01:44.234 --> 01:47.107
- Glad you could make it.
- This is Dana and Chrissy.

01:47.150 --> 01:48.586
- Hi.
- Hey, beautiful.

01:48.630 --> 01:49.630
Hi.

01:52.199 --> 01:54.331
Hey, look.
Enjoy the party, have fun.

01:54.592 --> 01:57.508
Whatever you need, I'm here.
I have to make some rounds.

01:57.552 --> 01:58.727
- Okay?
- Okay.

02:00.381 --> 02:02.122
And that is Marcus, girls.

02:04.776 --> 02:07.127
- Brooke!
- Jay!

02:07.910 --> 02:08.954
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:09.824 --> 02:12.088
- Can we get a picture?
- Yeah, me too.

02:12.480 --> 02:14.308
- Absolutely.
- Thank you.

02:14.351 --> 02:16.136
Marcus! Get in there.

02:42.379 --> 02:44.860
What is that?

02:50.692 --> 02:52.781
Yo, it's on TV!

03:48.315 --> 03:49.620
Hey, how is it going?

03:50.969 --> 03:52.014
Hi.

03:56.061 --> 03:57.454
Bad vibes in here today.

03:58.542 --> 03:59.587
Go ahead.

05:08.351 --> 05:10.571
Can you speculate
what might have happened?

05:10.875 --> 05:12.312
Should our residents
be concerned?

05:12.790 --> 05:15.140
We're investigating
all kinds of possibilities,

05:15.489 --> 05:18.274
from a leaking gas main
to arson.

05:18.796 --> 05:22.409
But we do have an expert
from the USGS

05:22.800 --> 05:26.369
and he is on site
and will be assessing to see

05:26.413 --> 05:28.458
if this is
a natural gas buildup.

05:29.329 --> 05:31.679
Like the 1985 Fairfax explosion.

05:33.898 --> 05:35.987
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have with us Dr. Paul Grant

05:36.553 --> 05:38.294
from the United States
Geological Survey.

05:38.338 --> 05:40.688
Dr. Grant,
how could this have happened?

05:41.428 --> 05:44.126
Deep, minor earthquakes rupture
beneath us all the time.

05:44.387 --> 05:45.930
Not enough for us
to feel it at the surface,

05:45.954 --> 05:48.173
but some of these quakes shift
the rock underground

05:48.217 --> 05:50.480
and release pockets
of trapped gas, like methane.

05:51.176 --> 05:54.310
Shouldn't we be able
to smell a gas leak?

05:54.571 --> 05:56.530
We add a chemical to natural gas

05:56.573 --> 05:58.096
so that we can detect it
by odor,

05:58.140 --> 06:00.490
but if a fissure or pocket
under the shop was leaking

06:00.534 --> 06:02.623
concentrated methane
into an enclosed area,

06:03.014 --> 06:04.014
no one would know.

06:05.321 --> 06:06.733
All gas lines running here
have been shut them off,

06:06.757 --> 06:08.280
but the fire's still burning.

06:08.324 --> 06:11.762
It suggests methane bubbling up
from underneath the ground

06:12.197 --> 06:14.156
may be our best theory so far.

06:14.504 --> 06:15.636
If I may, John?

06:17.072 --> 06:19.161
Most of Los Angeles is built
over former oil wells.

06:19.422 --> 06:20.902
The city sealed two
earlier this year.

06:22.251 --> 06:23.491
Thank you very much, gentlemen.

06:24.166 --> 06:25.167
Back to you, Olivia.

06:30.215 --> 06:31.260
Good job.

06:34.045 --> 06:36.308
- Hey, thanks for the on camera.
- Yeah, no problem.

06:36.352 --> 06:38.746
Hey, I forgot the tickets.

06:38.789 --> 06:41.139
Can you guys meet me
at the center before my lecture?

06:41.183 --> 06:42.663
- Yeah, sounds good.
- Great.

06:43.011 --> 06:44.447
Hold on.

06:44.491 --> 06:45.753
Can you run those models again?

06:47.189 --> 06:49.349
- I got to take this.
- Yes, no problem. See you later.

06:49.931 --> 06:51.062
Hey, you're here?

06:51.323 --> 06:53.195
No, we're about an hour out.

06:53.717 --> 06:55.371
I cannot wait to see you.

06:55.415 --> 06:56.981
Yeah, the forecast looks good.

06:57.025 --> 06:58.374
Wait until you move here.

06:58.418 --> 06:59.854
Every day is
absolutely beautiful.

06:59.897 --> 07:01.421
- Did you get our tickets?
- Of course.

07:02.204 --> 07:05.033
Listen to this.
The CA Energy Center houses

07:05.337 --> 07:07.339
more than 30 renewable
energy exhibits,

07:07.862 --> 07:10.386
including the new history
of fossil fuels--

07:10.430 --> 07:12.016
My God, Derek.
We are not doing that.

07:12.040 --> 07:13.476
You don't have to go.

07:13.520 --> 07:15.739
Look, we'll all go, okay?
It's a family thing.

07:16.348 --> 07:17.785
We'll do what Brooke wants
tomorrow.

07:17.828 --> 07:19.177
No, John.

07:19.221 --> 07:21.353
We're shopping
with Margot tomorrow.

07:21.789 --> 07:23.965
Aunt Margot got me
into Marcus' record party.

07:25.575 --> 07:28.622
- When is that?
- I told you about it, remember?

07:28.665 --> 07:30.145
Chrissy and Dana
are gonna pick me up.

07:30.493 --> 07:31.601
- Who?
- Pick you up...

07:31.625 --> 07:32.930
...and drop you off, right?

07:32.974 --> 07:35.498
I can get a ride with Marcus
or Jill, whatever.

07:35.542 --> 07:36.543
What? Today?

07:36.978 --> 07:38.327
They have a dinosaur hall,

07:38.370 --> 07:40.416
and the Science Center
is right next door.

07:45.073 --> 07:46.770
You'll have so much fun
with your Dad.

07:46.814 --> 07:48.555
I got to go, all right?

07:48.598 --> 07:50.470
I'll meet you guys back
at the house later.

07:50.513 --> 07:52.384
Are they sirens?

07:52.428 --> 07:54.604
- What are you doing?
- Is everything okay?

07:54.909 --> 07:57.520
Yeah, just another day in LA.
Don't worry, okay?

07:58.303 --> 07:59.304
I love you guys.

07:59.609 --> 08:01.002
Okay, bye.

08:01.045 --> 08:02.133
- See you later, Dad!
- Bye.

08:02.394 --> 08:03.394
Bye-bye.

08:07.356 --> 08:09.880
- Liv?
- John, monitor.

08:10.881 --> 08:12.056
Hey!

08:12.100 --> 08:14.102
Anyone from Emergency Management show?

08:14.363 --> 08:15.364
Not here.

08:16.974 --> 08:18.865
We need a statement.
Why aren't they investigating?

08:18.889 --> 08:20.369
I'll find out where Garcia is.

08:21.022 --> 08:22.893
I don't think
the Chief of Police is ready...

08:22.937 --> 08:25.200
- ...to make a statement.
- Science is boring.

08:25.505 --> 08:26.984
Earthquakes, methane, we get it.

08:27.028 --> 08:28.943
What about a possible link
to terrorism?

08:29.683 --> 08:31.249
We're scared when the people

08:31.293 --> 08:33.991
who are supposed to protect us
aren't there.

08:34.034 --> 08:35.427
Are we leading on this?

08:35.818 --> 08:37.255
If you get something
we can sell.

08:37.691 --> 08:39.866
- All right. I'm on it.
- When does your family arrive?

08:40.128 --> 08:41.563
- A couple of hours.
- Good.

08:42.217 --> 08:43.653
Perfect. You've got time.

08:43.697 --> 08:45.525
I'm texting you
names and addresses.

08:45.786 --> 08:47.004
Okay. See you.

08:49.224 --> 08:50.442
- Got the keys?
- Yeah.

08:50.791 --> 08:51.879
- I'll drive.
- All right.

09:17.774 --> 09:19.733
Mom, do you know
where that book Dad sent me is?

09:19.776 --> 09:21.082
I want to get it signed.

09:21.125 --> 09:22.518
Did you check
your whole backpack?

09:22.736 --> 09:25.608
- I checked.
- Then, I don't know where it is.

09:25.652 --> 09:27.612
- Maybe you didn't bring it.
- I know I packed it!

09:28.219 --> 09:29.219
No, no, no, no, no!

09:29.438 --> 09:30.787
Lower the volume.

09:30.831 --> 09:32.711
Derek, just calm down.
Start from the beginning.

09:39.753 --> 09:40.884
Never mind.

09:42.843 --> 09:44.322
Okay, hit me with the C's.

09:45.367 --> 09:48.022
- Cell, charger, cash.
- You are good, man.

09:49.197 --> 09:51.357
You should give him extra cash.
He's gonna be with Dad.

09:53.070 --> 09:55.159
You know he's going to ask
about your applications.

09:55.986 --> 09:58.685
- You should tell him.
- You first.

10:00.164 --> 10:01.992
Radiometric dating
of animal bones

10:02.036 --> 10:04.299
from the La Brea Tar Pits show
the oldest fossil

10:04.342 --> 10:06.475
to be 38,000 years old.

10:06.736 --> 10:08.433
Wow.

10:21.272 --> 10:23.231
Slow down. Almost there.

10:24.145 --> 10:26.887
- Is it the next one or...?
- Wait, this is it!

10:31.587 --> 10:32.632
Wow.

10:35.243 --> 10:36.374
Look at that house.

10:37.985 --> 10:39.551
I could get used
to the one percent.

10:42.206 --> 10:43.206
Wow!

10:45.775 --> 10:46.907
Here we go.

10:50.040 --> 10:51.041
Beautiful.

10:51.868 --> 10:52.956
Okay.

10:54.392 --> 10:56.830
Finally!
What freeway did you take?

10:58.309 --> 11:00.964
I think we came in
on the Five Interstate.

11:01.312 --> 11:03.445
After 10,
you have to stay off the I5,

11:03.488 --> 11:04.664
the 405 is better.

11:05.969 --> 11:07.971
I missed you so much.
Come here.

11:10.365 --> 11:11.714
This house is amazing.

11:12.802 --> 11:14.543
Look at your babies!

11:14.586 --> 11:16.240
Hi, Aunt Margot.

11:16.284 --> 11:17.938
Yeah, they have their moments.

11:18.765 --> 11:20.680
- I love your shoes.
- Thank you.

11:21.071 --> 11:22.899
We are going to have
so much fun.

11:22.943 --> 11:23.944
Come on. Come on in.

11:29.863 --> 11:33.040
You can drop your stuff here.
I'll give you guys a quick tour.

11:34.389 --> 11:36.696
- Look at that TV.
- And there's a pool!

11:37.174 --> 11:39.611
Go on.
Help yourself to anything.

11:40.656 --> 11:42.310
You still think
I should marry for love?

11:42.876 --> 11:45.487
I think you should go
to college.

11:55.192 --> 11:56.890
Brooke, you and Derek are there.

11:58.630 --> 12:02.156
Cathy, I set you up
this time here.

12:05.246 --> 12:08.684
And here we have
Marcus' messy room.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.730
Sounds about right.

12:12.209 --> 12:13.733
- Great.
- Yeah.

12:13.776 --> 12:17.780
So, did you check out
those schools I sent you?

12:17.824 --> 12:19.869
In LA., we've got
great private schools here.

12:19.913 --> 12:21.523
Derek doesn't need
a private school.

12:21.566 --> 12:23.830
- He's doing great.
- Is he still on meds?

12:24.613 --> 12:26.658
It's not that kind of problem,
Margot.

12:26.920 --> 12:28.617
It's not a problem at all.

12:29.923 --> 12:32.664
Um, okay. So well,
there's the pool out here...

12:36.320 --> 12:39.628
...hot tub, lounge
on the chairs, wherever.

12:39.671 --> 12:41.631
- This is beautiful.
- Thank you.

12:41.848 --> 12:43.414
God, it's so nice out here.

12:44.764 --> 12:46.204
We can do a little barbecue,

12:50.117 --> 12:52.380
and here we are back
at the kitchen.

12:53.424 --> 12:54.643
Nice.

12:54.686 --> 12:56.246
Can I pour you a glass of wine?

12:56.471 --> 12:58.603
- No, thank you.
- No, she'll have a glass.

12:59.866 --> 13:01.650
Yes, I will have a glass.
Thank you.

13:04.044 --> 13:05.393
That's good, thanks.

13:06.046 --> 13:08.004
And I have something for you.

13:12.617 --> 13:13.923
VIP passes?

13:13.967 --> 13:15.403
- This is so cool.
- Yeah.

13:15.838 --> 13:17.405
Brooke is writing
some of her own music.

13:17.448 --> 13:19.842
No. It's just a few things.
It's nothing like Marcus.

13:19.886 --> 13:21.844
It starts in a few hours
with the label event

13:21.888 --> 13:23.454
and then the after party.

13:23.803 --> 13:25.195
Marcus knows you're coming.

13:25.239 --> 13:27.371
God, Dana and Chrissy
are gonna lose their minds.

13:27.632 --> 13:29.069
Friends from Iowa,

13:29.112 --> 13:31.593
neighborhood girls who moved out
here about a year ago.

13:31.898 --> 13:33.160
What about you?

13:34.248 --> 13:36.424
It's Dad! Dad is on TV!

13:37.686 --> 13:39.253
- If I may, John.
- Yes, sir.

13:39.862 --> 13:42.734
Most of Los Angeles is built
on former oil wells.

13:43.170 --> 13:44.345
There was an explosion.

13:45.737 --> 13:47.537
- That's awful.
- Thank you, gentlemen.

13:47.696 --> 13:48.958
Back to you, Olivia.

13:49.002 --> 13:50.264
A dramatic morning.

13:50.307 --> 13:51.918
That was John Benson
on the scene

13:51.961 --> 13:54.442
of a fatal explosion
in West Hollywood.

13:54.485 --> 13:56.879
We're hearing now
authorities have evacuated--

13:56.923 --> 13:58.054
Dad's boss is hot.

13:59.751 --> 14:01.381
In this area of the explosion,
that now has forced more than 20

14:01.405 --> 14:03.973
of the buildings to evacuate
in that particular zone.

14:04.017 --> 14:06.280
Firemen are still pulling
the rubble apart

14:06.323 --> 14:07.716
searching for clues
as the source--

14:07.759 --> 14:10.023
Hey, did they mention
how the fire started?

14:10.284 --> 14:11.459
It's really cool.

14:11.502 --> 14:13.132
Dad was talking
about subterranean methane

14:13.156 --> 14:15.289
that seeped into the floor
and kaboom.

14:15.332 --> 14:16.899
Derek! Come on!

14:16.943 --> 14:18.901
People are turning
to social media

14:18.945 --> 14:20.337
to share their stories.

14:20.381 --> 14:21.924
We'll continue
to follow developments

14:21.948 --> 14:23.384
on this story
throughout the day.

14:23.427 --> 14:25.014
We'll get them to you
as quickly as we can.

14:25.038 --> 14:26.358
Olivia, this has been
scary stuff.

14:27.518 --> 14:28.389
City and state officials
have capped

14:28.432 --> 14:29.956
two abandoned oil wells

14:29.999 --> 14:32.393
in Echo Park saying that
the safety of residents...

14:32.436 --> 14:33.996
...is their top priority.

14:34.525 --> 14:36.397
Coming up, more videos from--

14:36.963 --> 14:38.790
- Do you feel that?
- Earthquake.

14:39.791 --> 14:41.054
We're having an earthquake.

14:52.935 --> 14:54.023
Come on! Let's go!

14:54.371 --> 14:57.070
- Where?
- Go under the table!

14:59.594 --> 15:00.812
Okay!

15:22.834 --> 15:25.446
Whoa! That was a good one.

15:28.188 --> 15:29.493
Is everyone okay?

15:31.234 --> 15:32.777
We're still feeling
this here in the studio.

15:32.801 --> 15:34.387
Yeah, we don't know
where this is centered yet,

15:34.411 --> 15:36.065
but we'll get to work
on it as reports--

15:36.109 --> 15:37.173
It's just a scratch.

15:37.197 --> 15:38.807
- What?
- It's just a scratch.

15:38.850 --> 15:40.374
- Come here!
- It's just a scratch.

15:40.635 --> 15:42.811
Yeah.
We got to clean that up.

15:44.465 --> 15:46.380
Here.
Just put some pressure on it.

15:46.423 --> 15:48.686
Nothing like
an earthquake after lunch

15:48.730 --> 15:49.992
to shake up your afternoon.

15:51.776 --> 15:52.840
Scary stuff. We don't
know where this is centered.

15:52.864 --> 15:54.214
People are calling in now

15:54.257 --> 15:56.346
as we pinpoint
the center of the quake.

15:57.173 --> 15:58.914
I know you felt that
back at the studio.

15:58.958 --> 16:00.220
What's your guess?

16:00.263 --> 16:02.048
I'm guessing
it lasted a long time,

16:02.091 --> 16:05.268
maybe thirty seconds here
felt like maybe a five to me.

16:05.312 --> 16:06.966
I'll put my money on 5.2.

16:07.009 --> 16:08.576
Yeah, I'm checking
social media now.

16:08.619 --> 16:10.423
One tweet from some guy
out there who says it felt

16:10.447 --> 16:12.232
like a bus was hitting
his house.

16:12.275 --> 16:13.624
So it's been strong.

16:13.668 --> 16:15.496
Yeah, tweet us your guesstimates

16:15.539 --> 16:17.933
at #LAnewsquake
as to the magnitude...

16:17.977 --> 16:19.577
- ...of the quake.
- Okay, that's enough.

16:21.676 --> 16:22.764
Let me see your hand.

16:23.286 --> 16:24.722
So what happens now?

16:24.984 --> 16:27.160
We open another bottle.

16:27.203 --> 16:28.248
Hit the pool.

16:28.291 --> 16:30.380
Margot, I mean the aftershocks.

16:30.424 --> 16:32.861
Probably,
but it's nothing really.

16:32.904 --> 16:33.905
It's fine.

16:35.211 --> 16:36.971
Really, it's all right.
It's not the Big One.

16:37.083 --> 16:38.190
No, you need to cancel
your plans with Chrissy.

16:38.214 --> 16:40.042
- Mom!
- Cathy, it's fine.

16:40.086 --> 16:42.784
The party is still gonna happen.
The girls should go.

16:43.089 --> 16:45.526
- Dad is on his way.
- He's still on TV.

16:45.569 --> 16:47.006
- Not anymore. He's coming.
- Sure.

16:47.441 --> 16:48.659
He said so.

16:48.703 --> 16:51.532
- He says many things.
- Okay, okay.

16:52.402 --> 16:56.189
Let's just make a plan
in case something happens.

16:56.537 --> 16:59.192
Absolutely.
We can all check in with you,

16:59.583 --> 17:01.194
and if we can't get
ahold of people,

17:01.237 --> 17:03.457
- we'll meet back here.
- Yeah. See, Mom? It's fine.

17:03.500 --> 17:04.762
That's perfect. Okay?

17:05.633 --> 17:07.026
It's kind of fun, right?

17:07.722 --> 17:08.766
Totally.

17:09.244 --> 17:10.377
All right.

17:12.727 --> 17:14.032
Don't clean that up.

17:14.076 --> 17:15.556
You don't have
to clean anything.

17:15.598 --> 17:16.644
Come on.

17:26.306 --> 17:29.657
Worry in fear to be
ourselves and be measured,

17:29.700 --> 17:31.050
but not good enough.

17:31.093 --> 17:33.269
A constant inside
the negative mind.

17:33.791 --> 17:35.793
Do not be afraid to try.

17:36.142 --> 17:38.709
The life worth living is
full of all the moments

17:38.753 --> 17:39.971
we've chased our dreams.

17:40.407 --> 17:42.365
Let your positive mind lead,

17:42.670 --> 17:47.109
hope, inspire, achieve,
believe in yourself.

17:47.153 --> 17:49.807
Self-confidence is the key
to self-improvement,

17:50.069 --> 17:51.853
growth and success.

17:52.158 --> 17:54.247
With the tools
of the positive mind,

17:54.290 --> 17:57.293
we frame challenges
and obstacles as opportunities

17:57.337 --> 17:58.686
to test ourselves and learn.

18:23.493 --> 18:24.668
Cathy!

18:26.322 --> 18:27.845
Brooke? Derek!

18:27.889 --> 18:29.847
- Hey, Dad.
- Honey!

18:30.109 --> 18:31.564
- When did you get here?
- How are you?

18:31.588 --> 18:33.329
Um, Derek, Dad is here.

18:33.373 --> 18:35.177
I've gotta go. My ride is here.

18:35.201 --> 18:36.724
Brooke! Come on!

18:36.767 --> 18:38.117
I'm coming!

18:39.379 --> 18:41.120
Honey, I just got here!

18:41.729 --> 18:43.449
- I'm sorry.
- Honey, your tickets!

18:44.514 --> 18:46.995
Thank you. You're the best!

18:47.300 --> 18:48.605
- Have fun.
- Thank you.

18:48.866 --> 18:49.954
I'm sorry.

18:53.219 --> 18:54.263
Hey!

18:54.829 --> 18:55.960
Hello, John.

18:59.094 --> 19:00.269
Hey, Margot.

19:00.574 --> 19:02.793
Looks like the place got rocked
a little bit.

19:03.098 --> 19:05.448
Hey, I thought maybe
you weren't coming.

19:05.927 --> 19:07.146
I was just--

19:07.189 --> 19:09.409
Working, yeah.
We saw you on TV. Thank you.

19:10.061 --> 19:11.193
So where is Brooke going?

19:11.628 --> 19:13.587
To Marcus' record party,
remember?

19:13.630 --> 19:16.111
- I told you about that.
- Come on, we're gonna miss it.

19:16.459 --> 19:17.634
Hey, bud.

19:17.939 --> 19:20.376
- You look great.
- Thank you.

19:20.420 --> 19:23.074
- Yeah.
- I brought those papers for you.

19:24.946 --> 19:28.471
- Yeah, did you tell them?
- No.

19:28.515 --> 19:29.994
We're gonna tell them together.

19:30.038 --> 19:31.561
You said we'd meet him.
Let's go!

19:31.605 --> 19:33.824
- Just a minute, bud.
- I've been waiting for hours!

19:35.391 --> 19:37.698
Well, how about tonight?
Family dinner.

19:37.741 --> 19:40.048
That thing people do together,
with food and conversation

19:40.091 --> 19:41.441
and about how school was today.

19:41.484 --> 19:42.983
Just because you weren't
there doesn't mean

19:43.007 --> 19:44.879
those things don't happen, John.

19:47.969 --> 19:50.058
How about a Dodgers game?
I mean, you love baseball.

19:50.101 --> 19:52.539
Those papers are gonna be signed
during this visit.

19:52.800 --> 19:54.323
- Who says?
- We do!

19:54.802 --> 19:56.978
We had a conversation,
you and I!

19:58.936 --> 19:59.936
We have to go now.

20:01.069 --> 20:02.766
- Okay.
- You'd better go.

20:02.810 --> 20:04.681
Okay. See you tonight.

20:07.293 --> 20:09.512
Later. Have fun!

20:10.296 --> 20:11.297
Come on!

20:23.831 --> 20:24.832
Come on, Dad!

20:26.225 --> 20:27.332
This is gonna give me an A
on my science project.

20:27.356 --> 20:28.836
Hello?

20:29.750 --> 20:31.186
Yeah, we're right outside.

20:32.448 --> 20:33.928
All right. See you in a second.

20:38.367 --> 20:39.847
All right. Here we are.

20:42.458 --> 20:43.851
This is magnificent.

20:48.638 --> 20:50.814
So, why aren't you going?

20:51.075 --> 20:53.208
That's Marcus and Jay's thing.

20:53.469 --> 20:55.471
I stay out
of their music business.

20:57.952 --> 20:59.170
I read he got married again.

21:00.128 --> 21:01.651
You heard about that?

21:02.173 --> 21:04.567
The paparazzi were a nightmare.

21:04.611 --> 21:07.178
They expected me to crash
the wedding or something.

21:07.222 --> 21:08.832
- Did you?
- No!

21:09.398 --> 21:11.313
I didn't have my getaway driver.

21:11.357 --> 21:13.924
One time. I did that one time!

21:13.968 --> 21:15.056
What's your excuse?

21:16.492 --> 21:17.991
I can't keep driving
your skinny, drunk ass around.

21:18.015 --> 21:19.495
- I don't live here.
- Yet.

21:19.930 --> 21:21.018
Maybe.

21:21.889 --> 21:23.064
You know what I mean.

21:27.155 --> 21:28.199
Yeah.

21:31.768 --> 21:33.683
I'm just not sure
about moving here.

21:34.815 --> 21:37.383
You're not sure
about LA or John?

21:40.734 --> 21:42.475
You know,
I want to go back to work.

21:42.518 --> 21:43.824
We have paramedics here, too.

21:43.867 --> 21:46.087
No. If I move here,
I'll end up in an office.

21:46.392 --> 21:49.438
- That sounds terrible.
- What, working or the office?

21:50.047 --> 21:51.048
Yes.

21:52.136 --> 21:54.051
What do you do
when you don't have

21:54.095 --> 21:56.402
to be a parent
all the time anymore?

21:56.793 --> 22:00.014
Whatever we want.

22:21.514 --> 22:22.515
Paul!

22:23.472 --> 22:25.213
- Tough morning.
- Yeah.

22:25.605 --> 22:27.389
Paul, this is my son, Derek.

22:27.433 --> 22:29.260
I saw you on TV today.

22:29.957 --> 22:31.524
- Can you sign my book?
- Sure.

22:31.567 --> 22:33.264
Do you think
the two quakes are related?

22:33.613 --> 22:35.789
The USGS app shows
a lot of activity

22:35.832 --> 22:37.138
in the Newport-Inglewood fault.

22:37.486 --> 22:38.879
When does it count as a swarm?

22:40.184 --> 22:42.273
We're looking
into the same thing.

22:42.926 --> 22:44.450
We should talk after my lecture.

22:44.493 --> 22:45.494
Yeah.

22:46.800 --> 22:47.907
We're measuring deep activity
near the mantle.

22:47.931 --> 22:49.371
The lab is sending
the data over now.

22:49.672 --> 22:52.632
- Of course.
- What does magma...

22:52.893 --> 22:54.693
...have to do with earthquakes
and fault line?

22:55.461 --> 22:58.289
So, why did you
become a scientist?

22:58.333 --> 22:59.813
Well, that's a great question.

23:00.640 --> 23:02.337
When you're constantly
questioning things,

23:02.381 --> 23:03.730
you're constantly learning...

23:06.472 --> 23:08.604
Excuse me,
are you from the news?

23:09.388 --> 23:10.693
Guilty as charged.

23:11.259 --> 23:13.522
I'm a reporter, John Benson.
It's nice to meet you.

23:13.566 --> 23:15.219
Hi. Can we...?

23:16.264 --> 23:18.440
Yeah, sure.
Hey, buddy. How are you?

23:18.484 --> 23:20.404
This prehistoric
whale skeleton is on loan

23:20.442 --> 23:22.052
from the Natural History Museum.

23:23.358 --> 23:25.229
Thirty-four
to 40 million years ago.

23:25.273 --> 23:26.883
It's one
of the most intense skeletons...

23:26.927 --> 23:28.367
- Get in the picture?
- Let's get in.

23:29.669 --> 23:31.366
One, two, three.

23:34.064 --> 23:35.936
- Great, thanks.
- You're welcome.

23:38.547 --> 23:41.811
Great. I've tweeted it
and tagged the center,

23:42.943 --> 23:45.119
so you can find it
on their feed.

23:45.162 --> 23:46.792
Okay. I'll share it
with the news station,

23:46.816 --> 23:47.904
maybe we'll get on TV.

23:48.165 --> 23:49.558
We'd like that, right?

23:50.080 --> 23:51.255
You ever been on TV?

23:52.518 --> 23:53.736
It's fun.

24:18.152 --> 24:20.894
Your cousin, he's so hot.

24:21.242 --> 24:23.810
His voice is
liquid panty remover.

24:23.853 --> 24:25.986
I can confirm that is not true.

24:39.478 --> 24:41.262
Y'all give it up for DJ Twist.

24:47.877 --> 24:49.009
Hey!

24:49.749 --> 24:51.751
Congrats,
your new album is amazing.

24:51.794 --> 24:54.318
- Glad you could make it.
- This is Dana and Chrissy.

24:54.797 --> 24:56.233
- Hi.
- Hey, beautiful.

24:56.277 --> 24:57.277
Hi.

24:59.846 --> 25:02.196
Hey, look.
Enjoy the party, have fun.

25:02.239 --> 25:05.155
Whatever you need, I'm here.
I have to make some rounds.

25:05.199 --> 25:06.287
- Okay?
- Okay.

25:08.028 --> 25:09.899
And that is Marcus, girls.

25:10.596 --> 25:13.033
Do you see the drummer
from his video anywhere?

25:13.076 --> 25:14.295
That kid is amazing.

25:20.127 --> 25:22.477
- Brooke!
- Jay!

25:23.826 --> 25:25.132
- Hey.
- Hey.

25:27.047 --> 25:29.092
This firecracker is
Margot's niece.

25:29.136 --> 25:30.311
- Hey.
- Nice to meet you.

25:30.354 --> 25:31.754
- Nice to meet you too.
- Hi, girls.

25:32.313 --> 25:34.445
- Can we have a picture?
- Yeah, me too.

25:34.794 --> 25:36.578
- Absolutely.
- Me too.

25:36.622 --> 25:38.537
Marcus! Get in here!

25:54.640 --> 25:56.598
Marcus,
did you drop something today?

25:56.642 --> 25:57.904
It's shaking the whole planet.

25:58.644 --> 26:00.428
With that being said,
I think it's only right

26:00.471 --> 26:02.299
I drop that new record again,

26:05.607 --> 26:06.913
Let's party y'all!

26:07.217 --> 26:08.392
Is this thing on?

26:38.553 --> 26:41.208
I could get used to this.

26:44.515 --> 26:47.431
You know, Brooke is thinking
about not going to college.

26:49.085 --> 26:50.478
I never went to college.

26:51.044 --> 26:52.523
I did okay.

26:54.569 --> 26:55.701
She's young.

26:55.744 --> 26:57.354
She's got lots of time
to figure it out.

27:12.500 --> 27:14.850
My God, there's a fire!

27:22.641 --> 27:23.729
What is that?

27:49.711 --> 27:51.931
Derek!

28:03.029 --> 28:04.987
You've got to stay down.
Stay down!

28:13.561 --> 28:15.563
Let me go!

28:38.978 --> 28:41.241
What is that?

28:48.161 --> 28:50.424
Boss, it's on TV!

28:52.905 --> 28:55.385
There are reports now
of a major explosion

28:55.429 --> 28:56.822
out in the Hollywood Hills.

28:56.865 --> 28:58.408
In fact, we're getting
calls and messages

28:58.432 --> 28:59.999
just flooding in
to the newsroom.

29:00.042 --> 29:01.759
Yeah, we've heard
people saying bomb.

29:01.783 --> 29:04.655
Yes, actually there was
a suggestion earlier today

29:04.699 --> 29:07.049
of terrorist attack
with a smaller explosion.

29:07.093 --> 29:09.356
- That was this morning.
- We just don't know yet.

29:09.399 --> 29:11.073
We have very little information available.

29:11.097 --> 29:12.770
- Bomb. It's happening.
- People are calling in...

29:12.794 --> 29:14.448
...saying they've never
seen or felt

29:14.491 --> 29:15.884
anything like this before.

29:15.928 --> 29:17.253
We are getting video
into the newsroom.

29:17.277 --> 29:18.800
We'll continue
to show that to you.

29:18.844 --> 29:20.933
Emergency crews are
on their way right now

29:20.976 --> 29:23.022
for those that need
some sort of assistance.

29:23.065 --> 29:25.851
We have no reports yet on just
how many residents out there

29:25.894 --> 29:27.504
may need some sort
of medical attention.

29:27.548 --> 29:30.812
We have heard that the blast in
the hills has destroyed homes

29:30.856 --> 29:33.336
and started numerous fires.
If you're just joining us,

29:33.380 --> 29:36.687
there was a second explosion
today here in Los Angeles.

29:36.731 --> 29:38.927
We want to stress,
though, still no information

29:38.951 --> 29:41.040
at this point if two
events could be related.

29:41.083 --> 29:44.043
Right, we are hoping
a statement from authorities.

29:44.304 --> 29:46.132
Nothing.

29:48.525 --> 29:49.657
We have to go.

29:51.050 --> 29:53.356
I'm with Marcus, I'm okay.
Just get out of here.

29:53.966 --> 29:55.271
Go now! Go, go!

30:24.735 --> 30:25.824
Derek!

31:04.340 --> 31:05.385
Derek!

31:29.148 --> 31:30.976
Brooke! Come here!

31:36.372 --> 31:37.460
Marcus!

31:42.901 --> 31:45.425
Dad! Dad! Dad!

32:16.282 --> 32:17.457
Where is your Mom?

32:18.806 --> 32:20.686
- I don't know.
- We're going to find her.

32:22.810 --> 32:24.290
Jake? Jake! Jake!

32:29.164 --> 32:30.383
Thanks.

32:31.645 --> 32:33.908
- Derek!
- Dad!

32:37.477 --> 32:38.869
- Are you okay?
- I'm all right.

32:39.087 --> 32:40.132
Where is Paul?

32:41.133 --> 32:42.264
Sorry, he didn't make it.

32:46.051 --> 32:48.270
- We'll keep trying your Mom.
- Brooke?

32:49.489 --> 32:51.317
Let's just keep moving.
All right? Come on.

32:53.797 --> 32:54.929
Come on.

33:02.110 --> 33:03.459
Let's go.

33:10.858 --> 33:12.033
Come on.

33:22.652 --> 33:23.958
I got to go back.

33:24.002 --> 33:26.134
I gotta go back.
I got to save my Dad!

33:26.178 --> 33:28.702
He would want you to go.

33:36.623 --> 33:38.663
My Mom isn't answering.
She always answers.

33:53.292 --> 33:54.336
Come on, Marcus.

33:57.296 --> 33:58.384
Marcus, come on!

34:07.567 --> 34:08.610
It's a volcano.

34:09.569 --> 34:10.657
Whoa.

34:19.405 --> 34:20.536
Get down!

34:53.003 --> 34:55.179
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

34:55.440 --> 34:56.920
Let's get out of here.

35:10.369 --> 35:11.979
This is the activation--

35:12.022 --> 35:13.328
Where are we going?

35:14.982 --> 35:16.622
We're going to get
your mother and sister.

35:18.377 --> 35:19.856
Did anyone use check in?

35:21.293 --> 35:23.904
...evacuation order
for LA county...

35:23.947 --> 35:25.601
- Brooke and Marcus are okay.
- Where?

35:25.645 --> 35:28.005
- ...Bel-Air, Beverly Crest...
- They're going to the house.

35:28.648 --> 35:30.867
- Keep trying your Mom.
- ...Hollywood, Mid-City West...

35:30.911 --> 35:32.478
Do you know
how to upload those videos?

35:32.869 --> 35:34.669
- This is not a test.
- Use the station's app.

35:35.133 --> 35:36.134
Done.

36:51.296 --> 36:52.427
Margot!

37:15.102 --> 37:16.190
Margot!

37:21.021 --> 37:22.196
Margot!

37:26.896 --> 37:28.246
My leg!

37:30.073 --> 37:32.032
Easy, easy. Okay.

37:33.076 --> 37:34.315
It's all right.

37:34.339 --> 37:36.732
You just need some stitches.

37:36.776 --> 37:39.648
- We'll get you to the hospital.
- Shit! It hurts!

37:40.649 --> 37:41.694
I got it.

37:45.001 --> 37:46.089
It's going to hurt.

37:52.879 --> 37:54.968
Okay. Let's go.

37:56.665 --> 37:58.319
- My God!
- Let's get you out of here.

37:58.363 --> 37:59.364
Come on.

38:02.062 --> 38:03.193
My ankle.

38:06.414 --> 38:07.850
My God.

38:08.111 --> 38:10.026
My God.
That was a bomb.

38:10.418 --> 38:12.638
- Let's get you out of here.
- Okay.

38:24.432 --> 38:27.087
Where is your car, Marcus?

38:33.267 --> 38:34.616
Are you okay?

38:38.968 --> 38:40.143
Where are your keys?

38:41.319 --> 38:42.450
Give me your keys!

38:48.848 --> 38:49.892
Is it these?

38:50.980 --> 38:53.418
Marcus! Marcus, which one?

38:55.724 --> 38:58.423
- Here.
- Okay. No, I'm driving.

39:10.217 --> 39:12.480
- Where does this go?
- Press the brake, pull it down!

39:19.487 --> 39:20.619
Okay.

39:43.163 --> 39:45.644
- Drive straight, go!
- Okay!

39:53.216 --> 39:54.304
Straight!

40:14.760 --> 40:16.283
We have to go west, right?

40:17.589 --> 40:20.113
Evacuation order LA County

40:20.156 --> 40:22.028
including Beverly Hills,

40:22.071 --> 40:25.510
Bel Air, Beverly Crest,
Hollywood,

40:25.553 --> 40:28.556
Mid-City West,
and West Los Angeles.

40:32.691 --> 40:33.996
We have to know
what's happening.

40:48.533 --> 40:49.534
I ditched them.

40:52.188 --> 40:53.363
My brother is out there.

40:54.234 --> 40:55.322
With my dad.

40:55.931 --> 40:56.976
Lucky you.

41:00.196 --> 41:01.241
I'm really sorry.

41:07.682 --> 41:09.031
They're going to your house.

41:11.599 --> 41:12.731
Our moms!

41:31.314 --> 41:32.490
Brooke?

41:33.926 --> 41:34.970
I'm okay.

41:35.754 --> 41:36.755
I'm okay.

41:39.018 --> 41:40.149
I'm okay.

41:41.890 --> 41:43.631
Sorry for how I've been acting.

41:44.458 --> 41:45.503
It's all right.

41:48.331 --> 41:49.332
It's okay.

41:50.595 --> 41:51.596
Shit!

41:52.640 --> 41:54.381
There's a pharmacy not too far.

41:54.816 --> 41:55.991
Just keep along this road.

42:01.780 --> 42:03.695
Hey, anything?

42:03.738 --> 42:05.871
They keep saying try again.

42:07.829 --> 42:10.615
No, Margot? No! Hey!

42:11.006 --> 42:12.617
I need you to stay awake, okay?

42:12.921 --> 42:15.010
You're going into shock.
I need you to stay awake.

42:15.271 --> 42:16.271
Margot!

42:17.447 --> 42:18.773
- Stay with me, okay?
- We need an ambulance.

42:18.797 --> 42:20.146
No! We're going to take the van!

42:21.277 --> 42:22.278
Come on.

42:23.192 --> 42:25.238
No! You can lean on me.
Let's go!

42:31.723 --> 42:33.159
- Stay with me.
- Okay.

42:33.202 --> 42:35.074
I need you to show me
where the hospital is.

42:35.117 --> 42:36.117
All right.

42:38.904 --> 42:40.558
Dad, have you seen this?

42:47.303 --> 42:49.088
Can they do that?
Erupt more than once?

42:50.611 --> 42:52.047
Some volcanoes never stop.

43:09.108 --> 43:10.457
Hey, hey, hey! No, no, no!

43:10.500 --> 43:12.067
You got to stay awake,
okay, Margot?

43:12.415 --> 43:13.982
- Come on.
- I should be with--

43:14.461 --> 43:16.550
Let's keep this leg elevated.

43:18.073 --> 43:20.467
- You need to tell me.
- He's with Brooke.

43:21.207 --> 43:23.513
You need to tell me
where the closest hospital is.

43:23.557 --> 43:26.342
- Brooke. God.
- No, Margot! Margot!

43:26.691 --> 43:29.737
Stay focused, okay?
Where is the closest hospital?

43:30.042 --> 43:32.827
Cedars. Cedars Sinai.

43:32.871 --> 43:34.524
And where's Cedars Sinai?

43:34.568 --> 43:36.135
Do I make a right
or left out here?

43:37.527 --> 43:39.181
- A right.
- Okay.

43:39.225 --> 43:42.402
Stay focused. I need you, okay?
You need to tell me where to go.

43:42.663 --> 43:43.795
- All right?
- Okay.

43:47.973 --> 43:49.148
Okay!

43:49.191 --> 43:51.193
Margot, stay with me!

43:51.237 --> 43:53.239
I turn right out here
and then where?

43:53.282 --> 43:55.023
- What do I do?
- Another right.

43:55.633 --> 43:56.677
Okay, another right.

44:21.702 --> 44:23.269
My God. This is crazy!

44:23.922 --> 44:24.923
What was that?

44:32.582 --> 44:33.758
What the hell is that?

44:38.545 --> 44:39.677
I think it's ash.

44:53.429 --> 44:54.561
My God.

45:02.351 --> 45:03.396
Dad!

45:10.098 --> 45:11.186
We're just fine.

45:13.362 --> 45:14.712
It's going to be okay.

45:23.372 --> 45:24.939
Look, keep trying your Mom.

45:30.815 --> 45:31.990
We gotta get out of here.

45:33.861 --> 45:35.036
It's voicemail.

45:41.260 --> 45:42.304
Useless.

45:42.870 --> 45:44.132
Margot, how is your leg?

45:49.834 --> 45:51.792
It's fine.

45:53.185 --> 45:54.447
Where is the hospital?

45:58.625 --> 46:00.061
So, we're getting close, right?

46:05.327 --> 46:06.589
You know what?

46:06.633 --> 46:08.766
I'm going to stop here
and take a look outside.

46:09.288 --> 46:10.332
All right?

46:10.593 --> 46:11.986
Hey, come on!

46:12.030 --> 46:14.423
You can't go this way!
The road is blocked!

46:14.467 --> 46:17.339
- You have to turn around!
- I'll be right back.

46:18.166 --> 46:19.254
Okay.

46:31.353 --> 46:34.226
Lady, you can't go any further.

46:34.835 --> 46:37.882
- You need medical attention?
- No. It's my sister.

46:37.925 --> 46:39.361
Someone needs
to look at her leg.

46:44.149 --> 46:46.586
- Where'd you guys come from?
- The Hollywood Hills.

46:47.369 --> 46:48.414
Damn.

46:48.457 --> 46:50.198
You're lucky
to make it this far.

46:55.247 --> 46:56.552
It's a volcano.

46:57.118 --> 46:58.250
I can't believe it.

46:59.164 --> 47:00.643
You'll need to turn back.

47:01.340 --> 47:04.734
They set up a triage center
at a school on Fairfax.

47:06.171 --> 47:07.694
It's just over a mile.

47:09.652 --> 47:11.567
- You're tourists.
- Boston.

47:11.872 --> 47:13.439
Hell of a vacation.

47:18.183 --> 47:19.271
You should come with us.

47:20.663 --> 47:22.503
You can't breathe this in
for very much longer.

47:22.535 --> 47:24.929
I just quit smoking.

47:25.930 --> 47:27.148
We'll see you there.

47:27.192 --> 47:29.411
There are people
looking for hospitals.

47:29.934 --> 47:31.718
We're going to stay
as long as we can.

47:32.240 --> 47:34.460
Everything is gonna be fine.
You'll be okay.

47:35.635 --> 47:37.028
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

47:45.036 --> 47:46.167
It's gonna be okay.

48:38.132 --> 48:39.699
This place doesn't look
too safe.

48:40.221 --> 48:41.831
We need to stay
as low key as possible.

48:41.875 --> 48:43.224
Take off any valuables.

48:43.529 --> 48:44.704
Stay close to me.

48:50.536 --> 48:51.711
You ready?

49:03.679 --> 49:04.811
Stay close.

49:15.387 --> 49:16.692
We just don't know yet.

49:16.736 --> 49:18.607
We have very little information available.

49:18.651 --> 49:20.435
People are calling in saying

49:20.479 --> 49:22.829
that they've never seen or
felt anything like this before.

49:22.872 --> 49:24.676
We are getting video in
to the newsroom.

49:24.700 --> 49:26.267
Getting ready to show that
to you.

49:26.311 --> 49:28.028
Of course, emergency crews are
on their way right now

49:28.052 --> 49:30.054
for those that need
some sort of assistance.

49:30.445 --> 49:32.273
We've been watching
some amazing video

49:32.317 --> 49:33.796
as they continue to pour in in,

49:33.840 --> 49:36.669
more and more footage
of a volcano that erupted

49:36.712 --> 49:38.105
just hours ago in Los Angeles.

49:38.149 --> 49:39.802
It really is amazing.

49:39.846 --> 49:44.111
The pool of ash and gas rising
almost three miles into the sky

49:44.155 --> 49:46.505
and poses a danger
to small aircraft.

49:46.548 --> 49:48.681
The leading edge of lava flow

49:48.724 --> 49:50.770
like the ones
you're watching right now,

49:51.118 --> 49:53.773
are traveling
at about six miles per hour.

49:53.816 --> 49:55.993
Once the channel gets
established,

49:56.036 --> 49:58.996
lava can flow
as fast as 40 miles per hour.

49:59.735 --> 50:00.780
Can I?

50:00.823 --> 50:02.521
Now nearly 150 feet high,

50:02.564 --> 50:05.045
the volcano has forced
a mandatory evacuation,

50:05.089 --> 50:06.612
Will they be okay?

50:06.655 --> 50:08.527
with emergency crews
on the ground right now

50:08.570 --> 50:10.877
in what they are considering
priority neighborhoods.

50:10.920 --> 50:13.140
The volcano may seem
quieter right now,

50:13.184 --> 50:14.837
- but it can erupt again--
- We go back.

50:15.186 --> 50:16.883
We should evacuate
with everyone else.

50:17.144 --> 50:18.406
You want to leave?

50:18.624 --> 50:20.669
Our families would want us
to get out, Brooke.

50:22.367 --> 50:25.109
Everybody is wondering
how could this happen?

50:26.371 --> 50:28.329
My Dad works
for that TV station.

50:34.074 --> 50:36.120
There's no answer.
Thanks anyway.

50:36.685 --> 50:37.860
I hope you find them.

50:38.209 --> 50:39.558
Videos just like this

50:39.601 --> 50:41.342
from all across
the city right now.

50:41.386 --> 50:43.083
This spectacular footage was

50:43.127 --> 50:46.521
just recorded minutes ago
by our very own John Benson.

50:47.348 --> 50:50.830
- Is that hail?
- Gravel stones. In the air.

50:51.483 --> 50:53.485
More and more victims
of the volcano

50:53.528 --> 50:55.443
as it now continues
to erupt in LA.

50:55.487 --> 50:58.185
Just tragedy after tragedy
being captured on cameras

50:58.229 --> 50:59.229
all around the city.

50:59.534 --> 51:00.622
Where are they?

51:01.884 --> 51:03.684
- Where is that?
- I don't know. I can't tell.

51:04.148 --> 51:05.988
Brooke, we need to find
your medicine. Come on.

51:06.411 --> 51:08.630
Look,
they're going back to the house.

51:08.674 --> 51:11.198
- They can't. You saw the map.
- No.

51:12.199 --> 51:15.202
It's my dad and Derek.
They aren't giving up.

51:15.550 --> 51:16.725
We can't leave them.

51:18.336 --> 51:20.053
They're not going to give up.
They're going to the house.

51:20.077 --> 51:21.643
I posted that message.

51:22.122 --> 51:23.950
I said we were gonna be there.

51:23.993 --> 51:25.299
I sent them there!

51:30.174 --> 51:31.305
This way.

51:51.282 --> 51:52.979
You know the hills are
on fire, right?

51:53.284 --> 51:54.937
I just don't think
they're still there.

51:55.721 --> 51:56.983
Don't even say that!

51:59.246 --> 52:00.421
Give me your phone.

52:00.726 --> 52:03.294
What I mean is
most likely they evacuated.

52:04.208 --> 52:05.383
La Brea.

52:05.426 --> 52:07.994
Derek was reading
about that and fossils.

52:08.037 --> 52:10.214
There's a triage center
at La Brea.

52:10.257 --> 52:12.520
Maybe they're there.
Maybe they're not. I don't know.

52:12.564 --> 52:14.348
No, no, no!
My Mom, she would go there.

52:17.221 --> 52:19.310
- Let's go.
- Okay, okay.

52:32.932 --> 52:34.194
Hurry up! Hurry up!

52:35.674 --> 52:38.807
Our car has broken down.
Can you give us a hand?

52:38.851 --> 52:40.113
What do you need, man?

52:41.680 --> 52:42.874
Come on. Whoa, whoa, whoa!
You don't have to do this, man.

52:42.898 --> 52:44.596
- Please.
- Come on, man. Come on!

52:45.205 --> 52:46.511
- Please!
- Shut up.

52:46.554 --> 52:47.686
Give me your goddamn keys.

52:49.383 --> 52:50.383
Stop!

52:51.690 --> 52:52.865
Stay down!

52:57.174 --> 52:58.305
Marcus!

52:58.566 --> 53:00.829
Give me the keys!

53:03.745 --> 53:04.964
Let's go!

53:06.183 --> 53:07.183
Marcus!

53:16.497 --> 53:18.817
The LA County Emergency
Operations Center announced

53:18.847 --> 53:21.850
an evacuation order
for LA county

53:21.894 --> 53:25.289
including Beverly Hills,
Bel Air, Beverly Crest,

53:25.332 --> 53:29.771
Hollywood, New City West,
and West Los Angeles.

53:30.511 --> 53:33.166
All residents must evacuate
immediately.

53:33.775 --> 53:36.125
Follow designated
evacuation routes.

54:09.811 --> 54:13.902
- Officer, where is the detour?
- There is no detour.

54:13.946 --> 54:15.513
We're evacuating
this whole area.

54:15.991 --> 54:17.791
- My Mom is in there!
- Not anymore.

54:18.733 --> 54:20.735
We relocated everyone
to the relief center.

54:20.779 --> 54:22.998
Yeah, we heard
on the emergency broadcast.

54:23.912 --> 54:26.654
- Car still running?
- So far, yeah.

54:26.959 --> 54:29.266
Take advantage of that
and get out.

54:29.309 --> 54:30.745
But we have to check!

54:30.789 --> 54:33.052
My Mom told us to come back here
if there's an emergency!

54:33.095 --> 54:35.054
You can't keep us away
from our homes.

54:35.097 --> 54:36.273
I said get back, sir!

54:37.926 --> 54:39.730
This whole neighborhood is under
a mandatory evacuation order.

54:39.754 --> 54:41.147
My dog is at my home!

54:41.190 --> 54:43.168
We're dealing
with this as best as we can.

54:43.192 --> 54:44.629
You're not doing anything!

54:44.672 --> 54:47.240
- Get out of my way!
- Everybody back up!

54:47.284 --> 54:48.807
We're doing the best
we can here.

54:48.850 --> 54:51.375
They said there's
a triage center in La Brea.

54:51.418 --> 54:53.246
My daughter works in a hospital.

54:53.290 --> 54:55.640
- She must be there!
- The best thing you can do...

54:55.683 --> 54:58.338
...is get to your designated
evacuation center now.

54:58.382 --> 55:00.384
The hills,
everyone was sent to La Brea?

55:00.427 --> 55:02.995
The triage center is
in evacuation as well.

55:04.344 --> 55:05.432
What, now?

55:06.912 --> 55:07.912
Come on, let's go.

55:09.523 --> 55:12.003
Everybody go to their vehicles
and evacuate to a safe distance.

55:18.837 --> 55:21.709
Go to your vehicles
and evacuate a safe distance!

55:32.241 --> 55:33.373
You ready?

55:34.853 --> 55:35.853
Yeah.

55:44.428 --> 55:45.820
Welcome to LA, I guess.

55:47.344 --> 55:49.955
Brooke, I swear
you hit harder than that guy.

55:51.826 --> 55:52.958
I wasn't going to move here.

55:54.133 --> 55:55.656
I thought your whole family
was coming.

55:55.961 --> 55:57.005
Exactly.

55:58.529 --> 56:00.463
I applied to college everywhere
they weren't going to be.

56:00.487 --> 56:02.837
- Anywhere good?
- Does it matter?

56:03.969 --> 56:05.753
- Did you get in?
- Yeah.

56:06.711 --> 56:07.755
But I told my mom

56:07.799 --> 56:09.148
I wasn't gonna send
anything out.

56:09.670 --> 56:10.932
She was so mad at me.

56:12.194 --> 56:13.544
I told my mom to stay home.

56:31.083 --> 56:32.824
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

56:43.835 --> 56:45.314
Okay, Margot. We're here.

56:47.882 --> 56:49.188
My God.

56:50.885 --> 56:54.411
I'll just tighten it a little.

56:55.150 --> 56:57.326
It's all right. All right.

56:58.066 --> 56:59.706
We're going to move slowly.
I'll help you.

57:01.330 --> 57:06.031
- I can't. Set me down.
- No, no, no! Listen to me.

57:06.074 --> 57:07.336
We can't stop now.

57:08.076 --> 57:09.208
I can't do this.

57:09.426 --> 57:11.950
- Just go. I'll wait here.
- And then what?

57:13.342 --> 57:14.648
Do this for Marcus.

57:16.171 --> 57:17.477
You can do this.

57:20.741 --> 57:21.916
I'll help you.

57:23.309 --> 57:24.353
Come on.

57:31.622 --> 57:32.971
We need some help!

57:33.319 --> 57:34.842
Can someone help us?

57:37.758 --> 57:38.759
Here!

57:50.989 --> 57:52.309
Can't you walk yourself?

57:55.123 --> 57:56.429
Let's go in there.

58:00.999 --> 58:02.217
Almost there.

58:03.305 --> 58:05.220
Okay. All right.

58:15.187 --> 58:16.580
You're going to be okay.

58:18.495 --> 58:21.846
Cathy, he's choking.

58:23.108 --> 58:24.196
Sir?

58:25.284 --> 58:26.503
It's okay.

58:38.776 --> 58:40.038
You're gonna be fine.

59:34.614 --> 59:36.703
- Liv?
- John! Thank God.

59:36.747 --> 59:38.313
Service is in and out.

59:38.618 --> 59:40.272
We don't have long.
Where are you?

59:40.925 --> 59:43.275
We're going to La Brea.
There's a triage station.

59:43.318 --> 59:44.363
La Brea?

59:45.930 --> 59:47.037
John, that's right next
to the damn volcano.

59:47.061 --> 59:48.802
I know,
but my wife is here somewhere.

59:48.846 --> 59:50.848
We've been running
your footage all day.

59:50.891 --> 59:52.501
The videos are amazing.

59:52.545 --> 59:53.720
Derek took them.

59:55.330 --> 59:57.202
They're about
to evacuate the studio.

59:57.245 --> 01:00:00.074
We'll keep broadcasting
from our station in Santa Ana.

01:00:00.118 --> 01:00:03.121
- You need to get out of there.
- Not without Mom and Brooke.

01:00:03.164 --> 01:00:05.471
Our family is out here
somewhere.

01:00:05.689 --> 01:00:07.342
Call me when you find them.

01:00:07.386 --> 01:00:08.605
Maybe we can help.

01:00:08.996 --> 01:00:10.824
Okay. Great, Liv. Thank you.

01:00:20.878 --> 01:00:23.184
Hi, this is Cathy.
I'm busy right now.

01:00:23.228 --> 01:00:24.316
It's just voicemails?

01:00:42.247 --> 01:00:43.465
It's okay.

01:00:59.612 --> 01:01:01.919
Margot, it's going to sting
for a little bit.

01:01:02.615 --> 01:01:05.009
And then it'll feel much better,
okay?

01:01:06.271 --> 01:01:07.315
Here we go.

01:01:17.761 --> 01:01:18.805
How is that?

01:01:34.386 --> 01:01:35.517
- What?
- Stop!

01:01:36.344 --> 01:01:37.389
Stop!

01:01:38.477 --> 01:01:41.262
Hey! Derek, no!
Derek, wait a second!

01:01:47.181 --> 01:01:48.705
Derek, what are you doing?

01:01:49.531 --> 01:01:51.229
Dad! Dad, he's in the front!

01:01:53.927 --> 01:01:55.712
Dad! Dad!

01:01:56.147 --> 01:01:57.583
Derek, get back!

01:01:57.801 --> 01:01:59.801
- I'm going to save you.
- Get back!

01:02:00.499 --> 01:02:02.109
Hey! Hey!

01:02:04.590 --> 01:02:05.983
It's gas! Come on!

01:02:15.340 --> 01:02:16.994
Hold on, buddy.
We'll get you out of here.

01:02:18.909 --> 01:02:20.475
Help me out, Derek!

01:02:31.356 --> 01:02:33.010
Help me, please.

01:02:33.488 --> 01:02:34.925
- Help me, please.
- Mister?

01:02:35.839 --> 01:02:37.623
Help me, please.

01:02:39.451 --> 01:02:40.495
Mister?

01:02:44.238 --> 01:02:45.326
Thank you.

01:02:45.370 --> 01:02:46.806
- Thank you.
- It's okay.

01:02:48.852 --> 01:02:49.896
Dad, call 911.

01:02:52.420 --> 01:02:53.465
Dad.

01:02:59.514 --> 01:03:02.822
No, Dad! Call 911!

01:03:03.867 --> 01:03:05.433
It's too late, buddy. He's gone.

01:03:06.913 --> 01:03:08.132
He's gone, okay?

01:03:10.090 --> 01:03:11.222
We got to keep moving.

01:03:12.527 --> 01:03:13.678
- You can't say that. No, Dad.
- Come on, son.

01:03:13.702 --> 01:03:15.661
We can't just keep
moving all the time, no!

01:03:16.967 --> 01:03:19.317
- No!
- Derek, listen to me, son.

01:03:19.839 --> 01:03:21.188
We got to keep moving.

01:03:21.928 --> 01:03:23.756
Okay? You got to stay strong.

01:03:24.844 --> 01:03:25.844
All right?

01:03:27.673 --> 01:03:28.761
Come on.

01:04:08.061 --> 01:04:09.541
My God.

01:04:14.676 --> 01:04:16.461
- Careful.
- He must be scared.

01:04:16.504 --> 01:04:17.636
Stay next to me.

01:04:18.637 --> 01:04:21.118
It's okay. It's okay, girl.

01:04:21.161 --> 01:04:22.423
Stay next to me.

01:04:22.815 --> 01:04:24.817
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where'd you come from?

01:04:25.687 --> 01:04:26.819
Come over here.

01:04:27.385 --> 01:04:29.126
It's okay. It's okay.

01:04:29.169 --> 01:04:30.431
It's okay.

01:04:30.475 --> 01:04:33.173
All right? Good girl.

01:04:33.217 --> 01:04:34.392
Good girl.

01:04:34.958 --> 01:04:36.829
We used to ride all the time.

01:04:37.699 --> 01:04:39.701
Mom made me take
so many lessons.

01:04:40.006 --> 01:04:41.225
It's okay.

01:04:41.268 --> 01:04:42.548
Where did he come from?

01:04:42.922 --> 01:04:44.482
What's that?

01:04:54.151 --> 01:04:56.501
We just found her.
We weren't trying to--

01:04:59.808 --> 01:05:01.114
Don't panic. It's cool.

01:05:01.854 --> 01:05:03.290
I came out to track him.

01:05:04.030 --> 01:05:05.075
Are you a survivalist?

01:05:05.771 --> 01:05:07.991
Yeah, there's nothing worse

01:05:08.034 --> 01:05:09.754
than being right
about the end of the world.

01:05:12.256 --> 01:05:13.387
Can you help us?

01:05:14.127 --> 01:05:15.346
Yeah. Whoa. Whoa.

01:05:15.781 --> 01:05:17.261
We need to go here.

01:05:20.917 --> 01:05:22.440
- You got a signal?
- No.

01:05:25.008 --> 01:05:26.096
Can you ride?

01:05:50.729 --> 01:05:51.860
You're doing great.

01:06:05.048 --> 01:06:06.527
Where are you going after this?

01:06:07.224 --> 01:06:08.268
Coast.

01:06:08.877 --> 01:06:10.575
We got a boat all stocked up.

01:06:11.358 --> 01:06:13.078
We're going to sail
straight out the harbor.

01:06:13.578 --> 01:06:14.622
We?

01:06:15.449 --> 01:06:16.889
You're welcome to come with us.

01:06:18.583 --> 01:06:19.845
We got to try to find them.

01:06:22.021 --> 01:06:23.109
Yeah, I get that.

01:06:49.222 --> 01:06:50.223
Come on.

01:07:46.584 --> 01:07:48.542
I don't see anything here
from them.

01:07:49.674 --> 01:07:51.241
Maybe they went out on a truck.

01:07:57.421 --> 01:07:58.596
Derek!

01:08:08.301 --> 01:08:11.304
Buddy, don't just walk away
like that, man.

01:08:11.348 --> 01:08:12.523
We got to stay close.

01:08:13.306 --> 01:08:14.525
You left.

01:08:14.568 --> 01:08:15.613
Let's run. Let's go.

01:08:16.483 --> 01:08:18.616
On board, sir.
Everyone on the truck.

01:08:18.920 --> 01:08:20.760
Why don't you get the injured
first? We're not.

01:08:21.792 --> 01:08:23.185
Wait. We just got here.

01:08:23.447 --> 01:08:24.839
We haven't even looked around.

01:08:24.883 --> 01:08:26.600
- My Mom might be--
- Evacuation is mandatory.

01:08:26.624 --> 01:08:28.756
Critically injured first, right?

01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:30.497
- We're not injured.
- Yeah, please.

01:08:30.758 --> 01:08:31.933
If your family was here,

01:08:31.977 --> 01:08:33.475
they've already moved
to the evac site.

01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:35.415
We're not going anywhere, okay?

01:08:35.459 --> 01:08:37.243
My wife may be out here.
We're not going to--

01:08:37.287 --> 01:08:39.593
- Mom!
- Derek? Derek!

01:08:48.950 --> 01:08:49.995
Where is Brooke?

01:08:53.129 --> 01:08:54.130
I don't know.

01:08:54.956 --> 01:08:56.783
- Is Margot okay?
- She's here.

01:08:56.828 --> 01:08:58.524
Her leg--
I did the best I could.

01:08:59.004 --> 01:09:02.050
She can't walk.

01:09:03.225 --> 01:09:04.618
Is she going to be okay?

01:09:04.662 --> 01:09:06.707
Yeah! She's going to be okay.
She's just resting.

01:09:08.404 --> 01:09:11.669
So we have to do something
so Brooke can find us.

01:09:18.415 --> 01:09:19.459
Last chance.

01:09:21.679 --> 01:09:22.680
Thank you.

01:09:23.376 --> 01:09:24.464
No problem.

01:09:26.770 --> 01:09:28.642
I don't know
what we would have done--

01:09:28.685 --> 01:09:31.210
- If you need anything from us--
- Don't worry about it.

01:09:31.950 --> 01:09:32.951
Find your people.

01:09:34.126 --> 01:09:35.171
Thank you.

01:10:06.898 --> 01:10:10.336
This has been the--
I'm not sure we have...

01:10:10.380 --> 01:10:12.164
I'm gonna get my phone.
Excuse me.

01:10:12.469 --> 01:10:15.298
Is there a white phone?

01:10:15.341 --> 01:10:17.301
...disaster in
the shadow of the volcano.

01:10:17.561 --> 01:10:20.172
No, no. No, that's it.
Thank you. Thank you.

01:10:20.216 --> 01:10:21.758
...people are now
being evacuated.

01:10:21.782 --> 01:10:23.586
The President, we understand,
will be addressing

01:10:23.610 --> 01:10:24.610
the nation very shortly.

01:10:26.004 --> 01:10:27.503
Lava continues
to advance across L.A.

01:10:27.527 --> 01:10:29.747
- Did you see her post?
- She's out there.

01:10:30.748 --> 01:10:32.402
Don't worry.
We're going to find her.

01:10:32.445 --> 01:10:35.579
The USGS now is stating
the lava is most dangerous

01:10:35.622 --> 01:10:38.234
when onlookers start
approaching the advancing lava

01:10:38.277 --> 01:10:40.279
and suddenly get cut off
by the flow.

01:10:40.323 --> 01:10:42.499
They're telling us
everybody should stay off

01:10:42.542 --> 01:10:45.980
the valley floor and get out
of any of the low-lying areas.

01:10:46.024 --> 01:10:49.288
Evacuation centers are
taking residents to safe zones

01:10:49.332 --> 01:10:50.681
and triage centers are--

01:10:50.724 --> 01:10:53.510
This facility is now closing.

01:10:56.295 --> 01:10:58.447
Military transports are arriving
for final triage evacuation.

01:10:58.471 --> 01:11:02.258
All patients should proceed
to the trucks immediately.

01:11:02.780 --> 01:11:04.477
I've got to make sure
that Margot is okay.

01:11:04.521 --> 01:11:06.523
- All right. Yeah.
- Excuse me.

01:11:31.939 --> 01:11:33.550
It's not that far.

01:11:39.947 --> 01:11:41.340
Buddy, help everybody else.

01:11:57.182 --> 01:11:59.010
- John!
- Over here, honey!

01:11:59.053 --> 01:12:00.316
- I'm right here!
- Dad!

01:12:12.719 --> 01:12:13.719
Brooke?

01:12:15.940 --> 01:12:18.029
- Brooke!
- Mom!

01:12:19.596 --> 01:12:21.337
Mom? Mom!

01:12:27.038 --> 01:12:29.038
- Where's Derek? Is he all right?
- Brooke!

01:12:32.173 --> 01:12:33.871
I'm very proud of you.
You made it.

01:12:33.914 --> 01:12:35.414
I knew you were okay.
I knew it.

01:12:35.438 --> 01:12:36.806
I'm so sorry.
I should have been there.

01:12:36.830 --> 01:12:39.137
- I'm so sorry.
- I'm okay.

01:12:39.180 --> 01:12:40.399
What happened?

01:12:40.443 --> 01:12:42.227
We were at the party,
and the fire and--

01:12:42.575 --> 01:12:43.707
Jay.

01:12:45.926 --> 01:12:47.754
- Are you okay? Are you hurt?
- I'm fine.

01:12:47.798 --> 01:12:49.539
- Where were you?
- Dad is not coming.

01:12:49.887 --> 01:12:52.368
- What? He left you?
- He's gone.

01:12:53.543 --> 01:12:54.631
He's gone, Mom.

01:13:00.288 --> 01:13:01.942
I tried, I tried.

01:13:02.203 --> 01:13:05.206
It's not your fault You're here.

01:13:09.689 --> 01:13:11.430
I am so sorry, baby.

01:13:12.213 --> 01:13:13.693
I'm so sorry.

01:13:15.826 --> 01:13:17.088
Lean on me.

01:13:17.567 --> 01:13:18.872
Put your hand over me.

01:13:25.792 --> 01:13:26.967
What is that smell?

01:13:27.968 --> 01:13:28.969
Sulfur.

01:13:30.362 --> 01:13:31.581
We need to go.

01:13:32.364 --> 01:13:33.365
Go, come on.

01:13:44.985 --> 01:13:46.291
We gotta get out of here!

01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:51.775
Get back!

01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:21.631
Come on, guys! We got to get
to the truck! Come on!

01:14:22.501 --> 01:14:23.781
- No, no!
- Wait a minute!

01:14:24.285 --> 01:14:26.200
It's too late. We can't
help him. Come on!

01:14:26.462 --> 01:14:28.812
We got to get to the truck!
Come on! Let's go!

01:14:40.867 --> 01:14:42.216
You know what? It's full.

01:14:52.575 --> 01:14:54.490
The car is dead.
So what about the van?

01:14:55.534 --> 01:14:56.535
- This way.
- Okay.

01:14:57.362 --> 01:14:58.537
Let's go!

01:15:01.801 --> 01:15:03.934
- Liv!
- John! Where are you?

01:15:04.195 --> 01:15:06.284
The triage has been hit.

01:15:06.327 --> 01:15:08.373
Are you on an evac truck?

01:15:08.416 --> 01:15:10.201
Yeah, the trucks are full.

01:15:10.636 --> 01:15:13.117
Don't go south.
The oil fields are burning.

01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:14.553
Traffic is stuck.

01:15:15.511 --> 01:15:16.990
What about downtown?

01:15:17.034 --> 01:15:18.533
I can get
a helicopter in the air.

01:15:18.557 --> 01:15:20.472
Nothing can fly in this, Liv.

01:15:20.516 --> 01:15:22.039
Not around the volcano.

01:15:22.082 --> 01:15:24.302
There's a helicopter
evac site on the river.

01:15:24.345 --> 01:15:27.044
Remember that renewal story
you did last month?

01:15:27.087 --> 01:15:28.175
Yeah.

01:15:28.611 --> 01:15:29.931
It's a safe landing zone.

01:15:31.439 --> 01:15:32.852
We'll look for you there.
John, it's the station chopper.

01:15:32.876 --> 01:15:35.182
- How many--
- Okay. Got it. We've got a lift.

01:15:41.188 --> 01:15:42.233
Don't lift it, okay?

01:15:50.415 --> 01:15:51.721
Your guitars.

01:15:53.505 --> 01:15:54.637
Your records.

01:15:56.203 --> 01:15:57.553
It doesn't matter, Mom.

01:16:00.643 --> 01:16:01.905
All our memories.

01:16:03.297 --> 01:16:06.126
I was keeping them for you.

01:16:08.651 --> 01:16:10.130
We're together now, okay?

01:16:10.827 --> 01:16:12.045
That's all I need.

01:16:20.445 --> 01:16:21.664
I'm sorry about your Dad.

01:16:23.404 --> 01:16:24.841
He was always really nice to me.

01:16:27.931 --> 01:16:29.019
Thanks.

01:16:40.334 --> 01:16:42.423
So, do you think we'll make it?

01:16:43.207 --> 01:16:45.557
Yeah, of course.

01:16:46.210 --> 01:16:47.733
Derek, we're all gonna make it.

01:16:49.692 --> 01:16:51.476
We were at the exhibits.

01:16:53.304 --> 01:16:56.089
Everything started shaking.

01:16:58.004 --> 01:16:59.658
We drove away, and there was--

01:16:59.702 --> 01:17:01.312
Hey, did you get
your book signed?

01:17:06.796 --> 01:17:08.014
He didn't make it.

01:17:09.233 --> 01:17:11.539
Gosh, I'm so sorry.
I didn't know.

01:17:12.715 --> 01:17:14.194
People don't live very long.

01:17:15.761 --> 01:17:17.328
They can live pretty great,
though.

01:17:22.463 --> 01:17:23.551
Kids, you all right?

01:17:25.205 --> 01:17:27.512
Hey, what is that smell?

01:17:36.956 --> 01:17:38.088
It's going to be okay.

01:17:39.176 --> 01:17:40.438
What is that?

01:17:45.617 --> 01:17:46.662
The tires.

01:17:53.581 --> 01:17:55.105
Everything is on fire.

01:18:14.211 --> 01:18:15.386
My God!

01:18:20.086 --> 01:18:21.131
Hold on, kids!

01:18:24.656 --> 01:18:26.745
Where are we going?
What's going on?

01:18:26.789 --> 01:18:30.183
Hey, we're okay. We're okay.
Dad knows where he's going.

01:18:39.584 --> 01:18:41.107
Derek, hold on!

01:18:54.773 --> 01:18:56.079
Everything is okay.

01:18:57.080 --> 01:18:59.212
Derek, everything is okay.

01:19:05.088 --> 01:19:06.132
I hear a helicopter.

01:19:07.830 --> 01:19:10.223
- That means we're close.
- Can you see it?

01:19:25.848 --> 01:19:26.979
Derek, can you see it?

01:19:29.634 --> 01:19:30.635
It's gone.

01:19:33.203 --> 01:19:35.031
It's okay. It's okay.

01:20:48.844 --> 01:20:50.062
Whoa!

01:20:59.028 --> 01:21:00.377
Let's get out here! Come on.

01:21:03.902 --> 01:21:05.338
- Let's go!
- Come on.

01:21:05.382 --> 01:21:07.340
Let's go!
We got to get up there!

01:21:07.645 --> 01:21:09.386
Come on, everybody.
Keep moving!

01:21:13.390 --> 01:21:14.608
Come on.

01:21:16.001 --> 01:21:18.308
- Keep it moving!
- Come on.

01:21:19.004 --> 01:21:20.179
Don't be scared.

01:21:23.269 --> 01:21:25.184
Let's go faster!

01:21:25.228 --> 01:21:27.578
Ready? One, two, three, go!

01:21:29.710 --> 01:21:30.973
Come on, Margot!

01:21:37.196 --> 01:21:38.241
Ready? Ready?

01:21:40.199 --> 01:21:41.287
You okay?

01:21:42.201 --> 01:21:43.594
Ready? Grab her legs.

01:21:44.551 --> 01:21:46.292
- Go!
- There you go.

01:21:46.336 --> 01:21:47.380
Next.

01:21:49.513 --> 01:21:50.818
Come on!

01:21:52.864 --> 01:21:54.605
All right. Ready?

01:21:58.478 --> 01:21:59.610
Come on.

01:22:01.090 --> 01:22:02.569
Help him!

01:22:03.570 --> 01:22:04.570
There you go.

01:22:05.224 --> 01:22:06.660
There you go. I got you.

01:22:09.359 --> 01:22:11.578
John! Hey, you okay?

01:22:11.622 --> 01:22:13.232
- Yeah. You all right?
- Yes.

01:22:16.148 --> 01:22:17.323
I'm so sorry about that.

01:22:17.367 --> 01:22:19.499
No, it doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter.

01:22:19.543 --> 01:22:20.936
I love you.

01:22:21.762 --> 01:22:22.894
I love you.

01:22:27.551 --> 01:22:29.422
- Wait.
- Brooke.

01:22:32.121 --> 01:22:33.383
Come on. Get her.

01:22:36.777 --> 01:22:38.388
- Derek!
- Derek!

01:22:39.041 --> 01:22:40.129
Derek, wait!

01:22:41.565 --> 01:22:44.307
What are you doing?
Brooke, you okay, honey?

01:22:45.264 --> 01:22:46.309
Brooke!

01:22:49.051 --> 01:22:50.313
Derek, get up here now!

01:22:51.183 --> 01:22:52.402
My God!

01:22:53.011 --> 01:22:54.970
Derek, get up here now!

01:22:57.363 --> 01:22:59.278
- Derek!
- Derek!

01:23:04.327 --> 01:23:05.981
Grab my hands! Jump!

01:23:07.069 --> 01:23:08.909
- Give me your hand!
- Derek, come on!

01:23:09.549 --> 01:23:10.724
Get up!

01:23:17.688 --> 01:23:19.342
- You okay?
- Yeah.

01:23:23.085 --> 01:23:24.608
Just breathe, honey.

01:23:24.869 --> 01:23:26.001
- It'll be okay.
- Hey!

01:23:28.699 --> 01:23:32.007
Hey!

01:23:32.529 --> 01:23:34.159
- Over here!
- Over here!

01:23:34.183 --> 01:23:36.098
- Hey!
- Over here!

01:23:40.102 --> 01:23:42.104
- Down here!
- Hey!

01:23:45.542 --> 01:23:47.283
- Hey!
- Over here!

01:23:48.284 --> 01:23:49.502
Down here!

01:24:11.524 --> 01:24:14.353
Come on! I got you!

01:24:27.236 --> 01:24:28.280
Come on, John!

01:24:38.203 --> 01:24:39.248
Gotta go!

01:24:41.728 --> 01:24:42.729
No!

01:24:44.035 --> 01:24:45.708
It's okay! It's too much weight.
I'll find you!

01:24:45.732 --> 01:24:48.126
- We can't leave without him!
- Go!

01:24:48.170 --> 01:24:49.301
Go, go!

01:24:49.345 --> 01:24:51.651
- Dad!
- Dad!

01:24:53.523 --> 01:24:55.351
I'll find you! I promise!

01:24:56.917 --> 01:24:58.223
Go!

01:25:00.704 --> 01:25:02.532
Mom, we have to go back!

01:25:13.064 --> 01:25:14.239
I love you, guys!

01:25:46.750 --> 01:25:48.099
One year ago today,

01:25:48.143 --> 01:25:50.232
the city of Los Angeles
was devastated

01:25:50.275 --> 01:25:52.930
by an unprecedented
natural disaster.

01:25:53.191 --> 01:25:55.759
These images were captured
by John Benson,

01:25:55.802 --> 01:25:59.763
a reporter, husband, and father
as he raced against all odds

01:25:59.806 --> 01:26:01.330
to save his family.

01:26:01.373 --> 01:26:03.636
The volcano couldn't be
predicted by science.

01:26:03.680 --> 01:26:05.116
There was no warning.

01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:07.205
For many of the people
who called LA home,

01:26:07.249 --> 01:26:08.554
there was no time.

01:26:08.598 --> 01:26:10.643
No time to save
family treasures.

01:26:10.687 --> 01:26:13.777
No time to escape.
No time to say goodbye.

01:26:13.820 --> 01:26:17.215
The death toll is still rising
as people search for loved ones,

01:26:17.259 --> 01:26:19.391
their families torn apart.

01:26:19.435 --> 01:26:21.306
John, a member
of our station family,

01:26:21.350 --> 01:26:23.917
drove through the ash
and fire and lava

01:26:23.961 --> 01:26:25.876
to rescue his wife
and children--

01:26:25.919 --> 01:26:27.182
That's enough of that.

01:27:01.477 --> 01:27:02.826
Bottom drawer!

01:27:04.001 --> 01:27:05.045
Got it.

01:27:08.484 --> 01:27:11.269
Dinner is served.

01:27:12.183 --> 01:27:15.230
- You okay?
- It looks fantastic!

01:27:16.318 --> 01:27:17.362
Very nice.

01:27:17.928 --> 01:27:19.190
