WEBVTT

00:02.303 --> 00:04.470
(door creaks)

00:04.472 --> 00:05.771
Come on.

00:07.208 --> 00:09.842
Artie:
So why are we in a barn

00:09.844 --> 00:11.110
In rural northeast indiana?

00:11.112 --> 00:12.344
Well, gay marriage
is illegal

00:12.346 --> 00:13.612
In ohio,
but legal in indiana.

00:13.614 --> 00:15.381
Makes absolutely
no sense.
No, no.

00:15.383 --> 00:17.783
I mean, what are we doing
in a<i> barn</i>

00:17.785 --> 00:19.451
In rural northeast indiana?

00:19.453 --> 00:22.054
I thought it would be fun
for you two to get married

00:22.056 --> 00:24.356
In the barn
that brittany was born in.

00:24.358 --> 00:27.059
What? Wait, what?

00:27.061 --> 00:28.894
Your father had his heart set

00:28.896 --> 00:30.529
On this trip
to the amish country

00:30.531 --> 00:33.832
And we spent the whole day
shopping for

00:33.834 --> 00:35.901
Handcrafted amish
electric fireplaces,

00:35.903 --> 00:37.336
And i had this

00:37.338 --> 00:39.371
Horrible indigestion

00:39.373 --> 00:41.206
From all that apple butter

00:41.208 --> 00:42.374
And i told

00:42.376 --> 00:44.643
Your father to pull the car over

00:44.645 --> 00:47.312
And i ran into this barn

00:47.314 --> 00:48.514
For some privacy.

00:48.516 --> 00:50.416
I quickly pulled down my pants

00:50.418 --> 00:52.017
And i squatted real low--

00:52.019 --> 00:53.252
And usually, i never look...

00:53.254 --> 00:55.187
Oh, my god.

00:55.189 --> 00:56.688
...But it was just my lucky day.
I looked down,

00:56.690 --> 00:58.857
And it turns out

00:58.859 --> 01:00.192
I was in labor

01:00.194 --> 01:02.594
And brittany, it was you.

01:02.596 --> 01:04.229
And i was
very lucky,

01:04.231 --> 01:05.931
'cause there was
a little cow over here

01:05.933 --> 01:07.199
And he helped lick you clean,

01:07.201 --> 01:08.667
And i swaddled you

01:08.669 --> 01:10.102
In a mr. Submarine wrapper

01:10.104 --> 01:11.437
That i found on the ground

01:11.439 --> 01:13.205
And i carried you
back to the car,

01:13.207 --> 01:15.040
And boy,
was your father surprised.

01:15.042 --> 01:17.009
That story's insane.

01:17.011 --> 01:18.944
Listen, i'm so happy.

01:18.946 --> 01:20.245
That makes me
very happy.

01:20.247 --> 01:21.513
I could not
be happier.

01:21.515 --> 01:22.748
I've got my two moms

01:22.750 --> 01:25.384
And future bffs
together at last,

01:25.386 --> 01:27.619
And i think,
babe...

01:27.621 --> 01:30.489
What?
...This is the perfect
place to get married.

01:31.792 --> 01:34.760
Well...
It could be fun.

01:34.762 --> 01:37.262
I can work with this.
You better.

01:37.264 --> 01:39.264
As your official
wedding planner,

01:39.266 --> 01:40.732
I'll be there
to make sure it's perfect.

01:40.734 --> 01:42.434
And while
this isn't

01:42.436 --> 01:43.902
Exactly what
i was picturing, either,

01:43.904 --> 01:45.137
Mrs. Lopez,
mm.

01:45.139 --> 01:46.939
I do think this place

01:46.941 --> 01:48.974
Has some potential.
Mm-hmm.

01:48.976 --> 01:51.043
¶ ¶

01:55.249 --> 01:56.448
Ooh, it's looking good, guys.

01:56.450 --> 01:57.716
Hey, when you're
done with that,

01:57.718 --> 01:59.118
Why don't you
give tina a hand.

01:59.120 --> 02:01.086
How did i end up doing this?

02:01.088 --> 02:04.056
These are, like,
700-pound hay bales.

02:04.058 --> 02:05.724
Because you volunteered
to help out.

02:05.726 --> 02:07.459
I didn't think
i'd be stuck

02:07.461 --> 02:08.827
Doing heavy manual labor,

02:08.829 --> 02:10.095
Or i wouldn't have worn heels.

02:10.097 --> 02:11.730
And i don't...

02:11.732 --> 02:13.132
I don't really know
all these new kids

02:13.134 --> 02:14.500
And i think they're
a little pissed

02:14.502 --> 02:15.767
That i didn't
re-introduce myself

02:15.769 --> 02:17.569
And now nobody's
talking to me

02:17.571 --> 02:19.838
And it's really
awkward.
Oh, no. What's wrong?

02:19.840 --> 02:22.474
I'm freaking out! I-i-i'm,
like, in total panic mode.

02:22.476 --> 02:23.976
I don't think this barn
is structurally sound

02:23.978 --> 02:25.244
And i'm scared
it's gonna collapse

02:25.246 --> 02:26.245
And just, like...
Like, kill everybody.

02:26.247 --> 02:27.246
Britt, you are just having

02:27.248 --> 02:28.347
Some pre-wedding jitters...

02:28.349 --> 02:30.149
No.
It's totally
fine.

02:30.151 --> 02:31.617
Like, we still, uh,
we still haven't had

02:31.619 --> 02:33.585
Our final fittings...
Oh, kurt.

02:33.587 --> 02:35.687
I just got a telegram
from martina navratilova

02:35.689 --> 02:37.689
That she can't be our officiant
because she's never really

02:37.691 --> 02:39.258
Done it before and she doesn't
really know either of us.

02:39.260 --> 02:41.326
Okay...
Oh, my god.
That's wrong.

02:41.328 --> 02:42.928
Can we-we just, like,
throw it up?

02:42.930 --> 02:44.630
Like, way up high?

02:44.632 --> 02:47.366
And these are
in the wrong spot.
Tina:
Well, you...

02:47.368 --> 02:49.201
You just said to put them here.
Okay, well,
you're wrong.

02:49.203 --> 02:50.769
I didn't...
That... I'm sorry.

02:50.771 --> 02:52.771
You know,
i-i'm here to help, okay?

02:52.773 --> 02:54.439
And britt, you have got
to trust me when i say

02:54.441 --> 02:56.341
That everything
is gonna be fine.

02:56.343 --> 02:59.111
I-it's okay to have a-a little
anxiety before your wedding.

02:59.113 --> 03:00.345
There's dirt on
the white thing.

03:01.982 --> 03:03.882
How did you cope with,
like, wedding planning?

03:03.884 --> 03:06.051
Well, i-i didn't really have to,

03:06.053 --> 03:08.654
Because we called it off
b-before...

03:08.656 --> 03:10.822
You remember?
I find it really hard
to track your relationship.

03:10.824 --> 03:13.492
Well, this isn't about me.

03:13.494 --> 03:15.327
Um... So let's just focus

03:15.329 --> 03:16.728
On the problems at hand, okay?

03:16.730 --> 03:18.830
Like the problem
of your boyfriend

03:18.832 --> 03:20.232
Being older than your dad?

03:20.234 --> 03:22.401
Wait.

03:22.403 --> 03:23.669
I know who
can officiate.

03:23.671 --> 03:24.836
Who?
Burt!

03:24.838 --> 03:26.572
Who's...?
Burt hummel.

03:26.574 --> 03:28.307
I-i don't...
I don't know who that is.

03:28.309 --> 03:29.975
It's-it's my dad.

03:29.977 --> 03:31.276
Sam:
It's his dad.

03:33.981 --> 03:35.314
Your... Yes.

03:38.252 --> 03:40.252
Listen up, bitches.
Here is the game plan.

03:40.254 --> 03:41.920
Britt and i do not want
to see each other

03:41.922 --> 03:43.322
In our dresses
till the wedding.

03:43.324 --> 03:44.323
So we're gonna come out
one at a time

03:44.325 --> 03:45.757
And show you our selections.

03:45.759 --> 03:47.693
Okay?
Brittany:
And no peeking, santana,

03:47.695 --> 03:49.261
'cause i don't want
9,000 years of bad luck.

03:49.263 --> 03:51.263
Ooh, let the fashion show begin!

03:51.265 --> 03:53.732
(cheering)
¶ oh, oh, oh ¶

04:51.492 --> 04:52.658
Mercedes:
Oh...

04:52.660 --> 04:53.892
Brittany, that's it.

04:53.894 --> 04:55.394
That is absolutely stunning.

04:55.396 --> 04:56.495
I think this is the one,
you guys.

04:56.497 --> 04:57.929
Rachel:
I think so, too.

04:57.931 --> 04:59.498
It looks so comfy,
you could dance in it.

04:59.500 --> 05:00.832
It's beautiful.
I know,
right?

05:00.834 --> 05:02.100
(exhales)
santana:
Wow.

05:02.102 --> 05:03.902
Wow, brittany,
you look so beautiful.

05:03.904 --> 05:05.570
Oh, my god, what are you doing?

05:05.572 --> 05:07.439
I was going crazy
back there, but

05:07.441 --> 05:09.007
You know what?
Everybody's right.

05:09.009 --> 05:11.076
You look incredible.
No, no, no.
You're not supposed

05:11.078 --> 05:12.644
To see the dress
before the wedding.

05:12.646 --> 05:14.446
Oh, my gosh, this is bad luck,
santana! Bad luck!

05:14.448 --> 05:16.481
It's okay, britt.
Calm down. It's gonna be okay.

05:16.483 --> 05:17.916
Here. Throw some salt
over your shoulder.

05:17.918 --> 05:19.284
Go back inside.
Go change.

05:19.286 --> 05:21.153
Okay.
Go, go, go!
What am i gonna do?

05:21.155 --> 05:22.421
What's happening?
What do i do?

05:22.423 --> 05:23.822
Hey, guys, do you mind

05:23.824 --> 05:25.090
If i ritualistically
slaughter this chicken?

05:25.092 --> 05:26.491
I want to counteract
the bad luck

05:26.493 --> 05:27.759
Of santana seeing me
in my wedding dress.

05:27.761 --> 05:28.994
Oh, my god,
you are not

05:28.996 --> 05:30.262
Slaughtering that
chicken in here!

05:30.264 --> 05:31.530
I know, but it'll help.
No. No.

05:31.532 --> 05:33.532
Take the chicken out.
(sighs)

05:33.534 --> 05:35.200
This is your lucky day, sir.

05:35.202 --> 05:36.535
Put it down.

05:40.174 --> 05:42.107
Santana:<i> Listen, if you want</i>
<i>to distract your mind,</i>

05:42.109 --> 05:43.608
Why don't you use
your math brain

05:43.610 --> 05:45.143
To help us figure out
the seating chart?

05:45.145 --> 05:46.545
Good idea.

05:46.547 --> 05:48.013
Okay, um...

05:48.015 --> 05:49.381
Well, i still think
we should seat people

05:49.383 --> 05:50.816
Based on the dewey
decimal system.

05:50.818 --> 05:52.984
So, like, uh... Kurt
should sit with rachel,

05:52.986 --> 05:54.219
Because they're both
a little annoying.

05:54.221 --> 05:56.555
No offense.
Why aren't

05:56.557 --> 05:58.357
Sam and rachel
seated next to each other?

05:58.359 --> 06:00.359
Carole and burt
are gonna be there

06:00.361 --> 06:02.694
And i don't want to upset them.
Everybody is fine
with you being with sam.

06:02.696 --> 06:04.229
They're gonna
be fine, too.

06:04.231 --> 06:05.864
I just haven't talked
to carole in a while.

06:05.866 --> 06:07.399
I did a lot, at first,

06:07.401 --> 06:08.900
And then i just got really busy
with the glee club

06:08.902 --> 06:10.469
And i don't want
to upset her.

06:10.471 --> 06:12.137
Mercedes:
Look, carole and burt
both lost people

06:12.139 --> 06:13.372
That they were in love with,

06:13.374 --> 06:14.806
And then they found one another

06:14.808 --> 06:16.408
And they started over again.

06:16.410 --> 06:18.210
They're gonna expect you
to do the same thing.

06:22.416 --> 06:23.749
Okay.

06:25.052 --> 06:27.486
And there you go.

06:27.488 --> 06:29.388
Wait. Okay, hold up.

06:29.390 --> 06:32.157
<i>No me gusta.</i>
Why is sue on the list?

06:32.159 --> 06:33.558
Rachel:
Oh, we should just
find her a table.

06:33.560 --> 06:34.760
She could sit
with becky jackson.

06:34.762 --> 06:37.062
No. No, she is not
invited to my wedding.

06:37.064 --> 06:39.498
Look, sue has just been such a
big part of our lives, right?

06:39.500 --> 06:41.767
I mean, we only met
because she put us
in the cheerios!

06:41.769 --> 06:43.402
Mercedes:
All i have to say

06:43.404 --> 06:45.103
Is if you invite the woman
to the wedding,

06:45.105 --> 06:46.671
There is an 80% chance
that she's gonna ruin it.

06:46.673 --> 06:48.073
But if you don't,

06:48.075 --> 06:49.775
There's a 99% chance
that she will.

06:49.777 --> 06:51.276
Praise.
Well, listen,

06:51.278 --> 06:53.612
All i'm saying is no.
Hell, no.

06:53.614 --> 06:54.946
If she's there, then i'm not.

06:58.118 --> 07:00.185
(sighs)

07:01.388 --> 07:03.388
So, i figured we could get

07:03.390 --> 07:05.123
Fitted for suits
at this place i know.

07:06.927 --> 07:09.127
Actually, i...
I had something else

07:09.129 --> 07:10.629
I wanted to talk
to you about.

07:10.631 --> 07:12.564
Um...

07:12.566 --> 07:14.199
I'm going to the wedding

07:14.201 --> 07:15.567
With blaine.

07:15.569 --> 07:17.569
Ah.

07:17.571 --> 07:19.471
I see.

07:19.473 --> 07:20.872
I'm so sorry.

07:20.874 --> 07:22.474
I-i never expected this
to happen.

07:22.476 --> 07:25.477
It's called "young love," kurt.

07:25.479 --> 07:26.478
It gets bruised

07:26.480 --> 07:28.713
And then it gets back up again.

07:28.715 --> 07:30.382
It's a nice thing.

07:32.553 --> 07:35.887
So... You're not mad?

07:35.889 --> 07:37.589
Mad?

07:37.591 --> 07:38.924
No.

07:38.926 --> 07:40.992
Jealous? Well...

07:42.830 --> 07:45.831
I mean, you're right at
the beginning of it all.

07:45.833 --> 07:47.899
I look at you, and...

07:47.901 --> 07:50.235
I think of the lifetime of love

07:50.237 --> 07:52.270
I could've had
if i hadn't wasted it

07:52.272 --> 07:54.239
Pretending to be
someone i'm not.

07:55.609 --> 07:58.343
You're lucky, kurt.

07:58.345 --> 08:00.278
Go be lucky.

08:00.280 --> 08:02.614
<i>And whatever happens,</i>

08:02.616 --> 08:05.317
<i>Even if you get hurt again,</i>
<i>just remember:</i>

08:05.319 --> 08:07.252
The only thing
worth doing

08:07.254 --> 08:08.653
Is going toward love.

08:08.655 --> 08:10.755
Don't waste time
double-guessing.

08:10.757 --> 08:12.858
And don't waste time
behaving yourself.

08:12.860 --> 08:15.160
<i>You gotta run, you gotta jump!</i>

08:15.162 --> 08:17.262
<i>'cause it won't stick around</i>
<i>forever.</i>

08:17.264 --> 08:19.130
You gotta grab it while
it's right in front of you.

08:19.132 --> 08:22.100
<i>Whatever you do...</i>

08:22.102 --> 08:23.935
Don't let go.

08:27.541 --> 08:30.041
(knocking at door)

08:33.347 --> 08:34.713
Kurt, are you okay?
No.

08:34.715 --> 08:36.314
I'm not okay, okay?

08:36.316 --> 08:37.549
I-i-i love you.

08:37.551 --> 08:38.817
I-i-i still love you,

08:38.819 --> 08:40.051
And i-i know everything was

08:40.053 --> 08:41.887
Completely messed up before,

08:41.889 --> 08:43.355
But everything's fine now.
So will you...

08:43.357 --> 08:44.890
Will you, will you go
to the wedding with me?

08:44.892 --> 08:46.791
I-i mean, unless there's...

08:46.793 --> 08:47.893
There's somebody else.

08:47.895 --> 08:49.961
There's no one else.

08:56.870 --> 08:58.303
Okay.

08:58.305 --> 09:00.138
So, i've gathered my best boys

09:00.140 --> 09:02.507
To get your opinion
on something.

09:02.509 --> 09:04.676
I'm gonna ask mike to marry me.

09:04.678 --> 09:06.845
Chang?
What you talking 'bout, tina?

09:06.847 --> 09:10.215
I got the ring and everything.

09:10.217 --> 09:12.817
Tina, i love you,
but this is kind of crazy.

09:12.819 --> 09:15.387
Is it really so crazy
for a girl to ask a boy

09:15.389 --> 09:17.255
For their hand in marriage
these days?

09:17.257 --> 09:18.323
When you're not even
dating the boy?

09:18.325 --> 09:19.324
Yes. It is.

09:19.326 --> 09:20.592
I think it's romantic.

09:20.594 --> 09:21.526
Thank you, blaine.

09:21.528 --> 09:23.061
When i was with mike,

09:23.063 --> 09:24.896
I was the happiest
i've ever been.

09:24.898 --> 09:27.232
Look, two of our friends
are getting married

09:27.234 --> 09:29.100
And we've had two other
near-weddings.

09:29.102 --> 09:32.704
I let mike get away and it was
the biggest mistake of my life.

09:32.706 --> 09:35.674
I can't afford to risk losing
him forever to some other girl.

09:35.676 --> 09:37.042
Grab the moment and run with it.

09:37.044 --> 09:38.376
Artie:
I'm all for that,

09:38.378 --> 09:39.945
But how often
do you guys even talk?

09:39.947 --> 09:41.613
We didn't much when i was here,

09:41.615 --> 09:43.048
But once i got to college

09:43.050 --> 09:44.449
We started texting a lot.
(phone buzzes)

09:44.451 --> 09:46.418
I mean, he's texting me
right now.

09:46.420 --> 09:48.119
I can honestly say

09:48.121 --> 09:49.854
That mike is
my best friend again,

09:49.856 --> 09:52.190
And he knows me better
than anyone else.

09:52.192 --> 09:53.258
I'd love nothing more
than to see

09:53.260 --> 09:54.526
You and mike together forever.

09:54.528 --> 09:56.761
He's awesome,
you're awesome,

09:56.763 --> 09:58.730
And you'd be guaranteed
to have asian kids,

09:58.732 --> 10:00.599
So they'd automatically
be super smart.

10:00.601 --> 10:02.934
I'm team chang-chang
all the way.

10:04.137 --> 10:05.537
What about you, artie?

10:05.539 --> 10:07.339
I can't do this
unless you all agree.

10:10.544 --> 10:12.277
I have my concerns.

10:12.279 --> 10:15.447
Uh, but if this is what
you really want,

10:15.449 --> 10:17.382
Then of course i support you.

10:17.384 --> 10:19.417
Thank you all so much.

10:19.419 --> 10:20.752
Yay!

10:20.754 --> 10:21.886
Yay.

10:21.888 --> 10:23.088
Thank you, thank you.
It's wonderful!

10:23.090 --> 10:24.656
Puck:
Ch-chang!

10:30.230 --> 10:32.597
(school bell ringing)

10:32.599 --> 10:34.132
Heard you wanted to see me.

10:34.134 --> 10:35.834
Make it quick.
I'm busy.

10:35.836 --> 10:37.569
Oh, okay.

10:37.571 --> 10:39.671
Um, well, i understand you don't
want me at your wedding

10:39.673 --> 10:41.740
And of course that is
your prerogative,

10:41.742 --> 10:44.676
But for the record,
i would just like to say

10:44.678 --> 10:46.277
That i'm very hurt by that.

10:46.279 --> 10:48.647
And i fully realize
that, over the years,

10:48.649 --> 10:51.583
Uh, you and i have had
a few minor... Differences.

10:51.585 --> 10:52.984
But weddings
are the time

10:52.986 --> 10:54.786
To put all those
differences aside.

10:54.788 --> 10:57.689
That's a steaming load of crap.
I want to be surrounded

10:57.691 --> 10:59.624
By the people who love me
and the people that i love.

10:59.626 --> 11:01.960
And the only person that you
know how to love is yourself.

11:01.962 --> 11:03.695
You don't know the
first thing about me.

11:03.697 --> 11:04.696
(scoffs)

11:04.698 --> 11:06.531
Yeah, actually i do.

11:06.533 --> 11:08.533
I know how selfish
and self-centered you are.

11:08.535 --> 11:10.969
Like the time
that you wore an exact copy

11:10.971 --> 11:13.371
Of emma pillsbury's dress
to her own wedding.

11:13.373 --> 11:15.807
And how you perverted
the very idea of marriage

11:15.809 --> 11:16.975
By marrying yourself.

11:16.977 --> 11:19.844
You are incapable
of a selfless act.

11:19.846 --> 11:22.447
And if you do what you always do
and just show up,

11:22.449 --> 11:24.449
You will be forcibly removed
by the security guards

11:24.451 --> 11:26.885
That i have hired.

11:26.887 --> 11:28.887
So have fun polishing
your trophies, sue.

11:28.889 --> 11:30.221
Bye.

11:38.732 --> 11:40.165
He's fragile.
Be careful.

11:40.167 --> 11:41.633
I can't get mud
on the wheels.

11:44.571 --> 11:46.204
Hi.

11:46.206 --> 11:47.839
You must be carole?
I am.

11:47.841 --> 11:49.040
Hi. I'm blaine's mom.

11:49.042 --> 11:51.042
Oh, my goodness,
so nice to meet you.

11:51.044 --> 11:52.877
Blaine's mom: It's so nice
to meet you, too.

11:52.879 --> 11:54.879
Hey.

11:54.881 --> 11:56.881
You're blocking
my face.

11:56.883 --> 11:58.516
Stop blocking
everybody.

11:58.518 --> 11:59.517
Smile.

11:59.519 --> 12:00.585
Mercedes:
Sam.

12:01.888 --> 12:03.421
My eyebrows are getting stuck.
Are you smiling?

12:03.423 --> 12:04.522
You smiling?
No. No, no.

12:04.524 --> 12:05.924
Okay.

12:05.926 --> 12:07.158
Um...

12:07.160 --> 12:08.159
(camera clicks)

12:08.161 --> 12:09.427
Did you take it?
Mm-hmm.

12:09.429 --> 12:11.229
I mean, everyone said
it would be hard,

12:11.231 --> 12:12.897
But i'm telling you,
man, the air force,

12:12.899 --> 12:13.898
It's a breeze.

12:13.900 --> 12:15.066
Wow, tina.

12:15.068 --> 12:16.201
You look super hot.

12:16.203 --> 12:17.602
Doesn't she, mike?

12:17.604 --> 12:18.670
She always looks hot.

12:18.672 --> 12:20.004
(chuckles)

12:20.006 --> 12:21.172
Well, i'll, uh,
leave you two.

12:22.576 --> 12:24.409
Oh, your tie's a
little crooked.

12:24.411 --> 12:26.311
Just straighten that
out a little bit.

12:27.714 --> 12:28.713
Hey, guys.

12:28.715 --> 12:29.948
Hey, what's up, guys?

12:29.950 --> 12:31.216
Just going over
my notes
(gasps)

12:31.218 --> 12:32.717
Before my
officiating.

12:32.719 --> 12:34.519
Oh, you both look
so handsome in your suits.

12:34.521 --> 12:36.054
Burt: Yes, you do.
Seems like
only yesterday

12:36.056 --> 12:37.522
We were getting ready
for your guys's wedding.

12:37.524 --> 12:39.724
That was the most
beautiful day.
Best day of my life.

12:39.726 --> 12:41.726
Aw...
Blaine:
It's crazy to think

12:41.728 --> 12:44.229
That we almost followed
right in your footsteps.
Kurt: Well, almost,

12:44.231 --> 12:46.231
And that would have been
a beautiful day, too,

12:46.233 --> 12:48.233
But, you know, it just...
It wasn't meant to be.

12:48.235 --> 12:49.801
Yeah.
Young and foolish.

12:49.803 --> 12:51.703
Hey, maybe you two guys
weren't meant to be,

12:51.705 --> 12:53.938
But, it's, like--
young, foolish? Come on.

12:53.940 --> 12:56.808
Are any of us ever really
ready for anything?

12:56.810 --> 12:58.977
No, i wasn't ready
to lose your mom.

12:58.979 --> 13:01.980
And because of that, we haven't
wasted one day since we met.

13:01.982 --> 13:04.048
That's right-- it's been
a crazy adventure ever since.

13:04.050 --> 13:05.884
Uh-huh, it has. You're
gonna make mistakes,

13:05.886 --> 13:08.153
And that's okay--
i have made so many.

13:08.155 --> 13:09.754
Are you saying
i'm one?
You are not
one of them.

13:09.756 --> 13:11.089
You are one of
the good things.
Thank you.

13:11.091 --> 13:12.957
Carole: But you
just have to take

13:12.959 --> 13:14.292
Every second
of every day

13:14.294 --> 13:15.727
And squeeze it
as tight as you can.

13:15.729 --> 13:17.929
Just wring every last bit
out of it.

13:17.931 --> 13:19.430
Finn taught me that.
Yep.

13:19.432 --> 13:20.832
Finn taught me that,
cancer taught me that,

13:20.834 --> 13:23.401
Seeing you in that hospital bed
taught me that.

13:23.403 --> 13:25.603
Man, officiating
a wedding

13:25.605 --> 13:27.405
Really puts you
in a mood.
Yeah, it does.

13:27.407 --> 13:29.607
You just start thinking,
and philosophizing...
Get serious.

13:29.609 --> 13:31.743
And-and "speechifying"...
Excuse me.
Carole:
So go and, you know what?

13:31.745 --> 13:33.344
We're gonna get you a beverage.
We'll let you guys...
All right, get me...

13:33.346 --> 13:34.646
I'm not drunk.
No, he's not.

13:34.648 --> 13:36.948
(sighs)

13:36.950 --> 13:38.750
Okay, mercedes, i need you
to find a spider,

13:38.752 --> 13:40.785
'cause it's good luck to put
a spider on your dress.

13:40.787 --> 13:42.854
Um, and tina, i need you to find
some wine glasses to smash

13:42.856 --> 13:44.489
Like the jews do, 'cause
they have the best of luck.

13:44.491 --> 13:45.924
Oh, and, um, rachel,
i need you to

13:45.926 --> 13:47.926
Find me a lizard
to cross my path...

13:47.928 --> 13:49.494
Trust me, it's, like,
witch's lore, or something.

13:49.496 --> 13:51.663
Go! I need all
the good luck i can get, okay?

13:51.665 --> 13:53.264
I don't want to end up
like jack and rose.

13:53.266 --> 13:54.632
Where the hell am i
gonna find a lizard?

13:54.634 --> 13:55.867
Go, go, go.

13:55.869 --> 13:58.169
(sighs)
good luck, good luck, good luck.

13:59.439 --> 14:00.939
When i pictured
my wedding day,

14:00.941 --> 14:03.341
I thought that i'd be
the most beautiful bride ever,

14:03.343 --> 14:04.843
But i was wrong.

14:04.845 --> 14:06.144
You are-- you look amazing.

14:06.146 --> 14:07.879
Santana, what are you
doing here?

14:07.881 --> 14:09.614
This is, like,
the ultimate bad luck.

14:09.616 --> 14:11.616
God, a bride cannot see her
bride before the ceremony.

14:11.618 --> 14:14.152
Why are you trying to
sabotage this wedding?

14:14.154 --> 14:15.553
You know what?

14:15.555 --> 14:16.988
This was all adorable,

14:16.990 --> 14:18.523
But now i'm putting
my foot down.

14:18.525 --> 14:21.125
Do you even know why a groom
couldn't see the bride

14:21.127 --> 14:22.160
Before the wedding?

14:22.162 --> 14:23.394
Cannibalism?

14:23.396 --> 14:24.495
No.

14:24.497 --> 14:26.698
Dates back
to arranged marriages.

14:26.700 --> 14:28.700
People thought that
if the couple had time

14:28.702 --> 14:30.134
To see each other
before the wedding,

14:30.136 --> 14:31.536
They would change
their minds

14:31.538 --> 14:33.037
And bail on actually
getting married.

14:33.039 --> 14:35.139
That's not us, okay?

14:35.141 --> 14:38.142
Because you love me,
and i love you.

14:38.144 --> 14:40.645
And no silly superstitions
are gonna change that.

14:41.848 --> 14:43.314
Hey.

14:43.316 --> 14:45.516
I'm really sorry
that i can't go an hour

14:45.518 --> 14:48.653
Without seeing you, 'cause
i'll just miss you too much.

14:48.655 --> 14:50.889
And me and you?

14:50.891 --> 14:52.523
Rules don't
apply to us.

14:52.525 --> 14:53.524
They never have.

14:53.526 --> 14:54.726
We make our own luck,

14:54.728 --> 14:57.562
So i say
that it's good luck

14:57.564 --> 14:59.931
To kiss the bride before the
wedding because then we can have

14:59.933 --> 15:02.066
That kiss that we can't have in
front of our friends and family

15:02.068 --> 15:03.401
'cause they'd be
too jealous.

15:03.403 --> 15:04.469
(sighs)

15:09.075 --> 15:10.575
Come here.
I agree.

15:18.451 --> 15:20.952
I love you so much.

15:20.954 --> 15:23.454
(sighs) but so does this mean
that i don't have to wear

15:23.456 --> 15:24.956
The blue underwear i
borrowed from tina?

15:24.958 --> 15:26.925
Ew, no, britt, no,
you shouldn't do that.

15:26.927 --> 15:28.826
I just felt
weird about it.
Ew.

15:30.797 --> 15:32.497
What the hell are
you doing here?

15:38.738 --> 15:40.371
You know what, britt? You
actually might be right.

15:40.373 --> 15:42.106
We might actually have
the worst luck of all time.

15:42.108 --> 15:44.709
'cause i can't marry you if i'm
in jail for killing this bitch.

15:44.711 --> 15:46.477
Look, kid, i come bearing gifts.

15:46.479 --> 15:48.646
There's nothing that you could
give me that i would want.

15:48.648 --> 15:51.049
I told you i don't want you
here today, so get out.

15:51.051 --> 15:52.884
Well, when you see
the gift i'm bearing,

15:52.886 --> 15:54.552
You will change your tune.

16:00.560 --> 16:02.026
Abuela?

16:04.130 --> 16:06.097
What are you doing here?
What's going on?

16:06.099 --> 16:08.399
Well, i stopped by your
<i>abuela's</i> house the other day,

16:08.401 --> 16:11.469
And laid down a little
reverse sue-chology.

16:15.475 --> 16:16.908
Mrs. Abuela, you don't know me,

16:16.910 --> 16:18.910
But i coached santana
on the cheerios!

16:18.912 --> 16:21.446
And worked very hard to make
sure her high school years

16:21.448 --> 16:22.947
Were a living hell.

16:22.949 --> 16:25.583
For some reason, i'm not
invited to her wedding.

16:25.585 --> 16:27.151
And i understand that
you're not going

16:27.153 --> 16:28.786
Because of your
religious beliefs.

16:28.788 --> 16:30.188
So i thought--
who better to enlist

16:30.190 --> 16:31.990
To ruin her big day
than you?

16:31.992 --> 16:33.958
So what do you think
about that whole...

16:33.960 --> 16:36.828
Stoning them to death thing
that the bible says?

16:38.164 --> 16:39.664
That's horrible.

16:39.666 --> 16:41.599
What do you think about
having them jailed?

16:41.601 --> 16:43.301
Like our good friends
the russians do.

16:43.303 --> 16:45.870
No!
Okay, thinking of a
more westboro approach?

16:45.872 --> 16:47.705
Getting together a good
old-fashioned hate group

16:47.707 --> 16:48.706
And picketing?

16:48.708 --> 16:50.108
(scoffs)

16:52.178 --> 16:54.145
I was wrong.

16:54.147 --> 16:57.148
I'm not saying i agree

16:57.150 --> 16:59.150
With every
decision you make.

16:59.152 --> 17:02.220
I still don't believe
it's right for two women

17:02.222 --> 17:05.056
To get married,
but i do believe

17:05.058 --> 17:09.394
That family is the most
important thing in the world.

17:10.530 --> 17:12.597
And i love you, santana.

17:14.968 --> 17:18.569
I don't want to be the person in
your life that causes you pain.

17:20.507 --> 17:22.907
And i don't want to miss a day
that i've been dreaming of

17:22.909 --> 17:24.108
My whole life.

17:25.345 --> 17:27.178
Or the birth of your kids.

17:27.180 --> 17:28.880
Or any other important days.

17:32.485 --> 17:35.553
I don't agree with everything
that you believe, either.

17:38.491 --> 17:40.091
I just want
my<i> abuela</i> back.

17:41.428 --> 17:43.327
I've missed you.

17:43.329 --> 17:45.229
I've missed you, too.

17:48.368 --> 17:50.435
I always knew sue was
my good-luck charm.

17:53.940 --> 17:56.007
(mouthing)

17:56.009 --> 17:57.508
Thank you.

18:01.247 --> 18:02.180
Can i hug?

18:02.182 --> 18:03.448
Santana:
Come on.

18:03.450 --> 18:04.882
Aw...
(laughs)

18:04.884 --> 18:05.883
I'm pushing
it, aren't i?

18:05.885 --> 18:06.884
Okay, all right.

18:06.886 --> 18:08.086
Sue:
Do your thing.

18:12.559 --> 18:13.958
Kurt:
Oh, is this so lovely.

18:13.960 --> 18:15.593
Blaine:
I know, it's beautiful.

18:15.595 --> 18:17.795
Where did they
find the money?

18:17.797 --> 18:19.797
Klaine, will you come
with me, please?

18:19.799 --> 18:21.799
We have a bit
of a situation.

18:21.801 --> 18:23.634
Nice try, sue,
but we're not gonna fall

18:23.636 --> 18:25.269
For an elevator
in a barn trick.

18:25.271 --> 18:27.271
Oh, no, porcelain, don't
thank me for forcing you

18:27.273 --> 18:29.273
Back into the arms
of tiny sal mineo.

18:29.275 --> 18:32.276
Listen, i swear to you on
will schuester's future grave,

18:32.278 --> 18:35.346
This is a legitimate
brittan-emergency.

18:45.592 --> 18:47.725
What are those?

18:47.727 --> 18:49.494
Uh, brittany,
wh-what's going on?

18:49.496 --> 18:52.330
Kurt, blaine,

18:52.332 --> 18:54.499
The whole time i was planning
this high-end barn wedding,

18:54.501 --> 18:56.334
All i could think about
was you guys,

18:56.336 --> 18:57.969
And not because you remind me

18:57.971 --> 18:59.770
Of the pig and the gay rat
from<i> charlotte's web,</i>

18:59.772 --> 19:03.975
But because i wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for you guys, okay?

19:03.977 --> 19:05.977
I looked up to you
as a couple in high school.

19:05.979 --> 19:08.312
You showed me there was a place
for me and santana, too.

19:08.314 --> 19:10.481
I mean, you taught me
how to be brave.

19:10.483 --> 19:12.116
And when you guys called off
your wedding,

19:12.118 --> 19:15.119
It just broke my heart.

19:15.121 --> 19:17.922
Because it felt like
my dream had died,

19:17.924 --> 19:20.358
So i want my dream back.

19:23.596 --> 19:25.596
Okay.

19:25.598 --> 19:27.431
I still don't get what you're
talking about, though.

19:27.433 --> 19:29.433
Yes, you do.
Just think about it.

19:29.435 --> 19:31.135
What brittany is
saying, blaine,

19:31.137 --> 19:32.937
Is that out
of our love

19:32.939 --> 19:35.306
For your love,

19:35.308 --> 19:37.942
We have conspired to deceive
and manipulate

19:37.944 --> 19:40.378
And, yes, imprison you briefly

19:40.380 --> 19:42.713
All to reach
this moment.

19:42.715 --> 19:45.650
We have two tuxes.

19:45.652 --> 19:47.051
Do we have two grooms?

19:49.889 --> 19:51.956
Okay, you guys are making funny
faces-- what do you think?

19:55.161 --> 19:56.794
I think you're crazy.

19:56.796 --> 19:59.030
I-i... Blaine and i
just got back together,

19:59.032 --> 20:00.565
And, uh, even
if we hadn't,

20:00.567 --> 20:02.300
E-even if we were ready,

20:02.302 --> 20:04.735
I mean, santana would never
let us crash her wedding.

20:05.672 --> 20:06.904
Oh, well,

20:06.906 --> 20:08.206
I would think again.

20:08.208 --> 20:11.209
Turns out i am a lot
like the godfather

20:11.211 --> 20:12.410
On a wedding day.

20:12.412 --> 20:14.045
And as crazy as
this all sounds,

20:14.047 --> 20:16.047
I couldn't deny my
bride her only wish.

20:16.049 --> 20:18.349
All you have to do
is say yes.

20:18.351 --> 20:19.350
Brittany (whispering):
Say yes.

20:19.352 --> 20:21.085
Say yes.

20:21.087 --> 20:22.486
Well, we don't
even have rings.

20:22.488 --> 20:24.388
Oh, i got that covered.

20:24.390 --> 20:25.823
(sue chuckles)

20:25.825 --> 20:27.225
So what do you
say, fellas?

20:27.227 --> 20:28.359
Will you give america

20:28.361 --> 20:30.995
What at least 52% of it

20:30.997 --> 20:32.330
Will legally tolerate?

20:35.368 --> 20:39.370
Uh, look, th-this is all
very romantic,

20:39.372 --> 20:41.005
And-and-and sweet,

20:41.007 --> 20:42.607
And-and-and a little weird,

20:42.609 --> 20:44.041
But, i mean, come on,

20:44.043 --> 20:47.044
Th-there is no possible way

20:47.046 --> 20:48.679
That-that...

20:48.681 --> 20:50.881
(chuckles)

20:50.883 --> 20:52.116
Right?

20:53.353 --> 20:54.585
Blaine?

20:57.190 --> 20:58.189
I don't know.

20:58.191 --> 20:59.523
I-i don't know.

20:59.525 --> 21:01.225
I...

21:01.227 --> 21:03.794
I just...

21:03.796 --> 21:06.430
What burt and carole were
talking about earlier,

21:06.432 --> 21:09.400
And these last few
months without you

21:09.402 --> 21:10.768
Have been really...

21:11.771 --> 21:14.438
I love you, kurt.

21:15.241 --> 21:17.141
I mean, i love you,

21:17.143 --> 21:18.476
I-i do, i...

21:18.478 --> 21:20.244
This is crazy,
this is crazy.

21:20.246 --> 21:21.479
And i don't...
I don't know...

21:21.481 --> 21:22.647
I don't know, but...

21:25.385 --> 21:27.985
But...

21:27.987 --> 21:30.621
But what?

21:35.995 --> 21:38.062
(etta james's "at last" begins)

22:35.388 --> 22:40.391

Artie:

22:48.301 --> 22:50.801

¶ at last ¶

24:06.779 --> 24:09.880
¶ oh, oh. ¶

24:09.882 --> 24:11.382
My husband's in the bathroom!

24:11.384 --> 24:13.918
And he missed
the whole aisle thing.

24:13.920 --> 24:14.985
Yeah.

24:25.631 --> 24:28.666
All right, don't say a word.
I am barely keeping it together.

24:28.668 --> 24:30.267
Uh, dearly beloved.

24:30.269 --> 24:31.569
That's how you're supposed

24:31.571 --> 24:33.003
To start these things, right?

24:33.005 --> 24:35.139
Uh, twice in my life,

24:35.141 --> 24:37.575
I have been lucky enough
to meet the love of my life.

24:37.577 --> 24:39.243
And both of those times,

24:39.245 --> 24:40.611
I've married that love.

24:40.613 --> 24:42.513
And i knew i was lucky

24:42.515 --> 24:43.814
To be able to do that.

24:43.816 --> 24:45.282
But i didn't know how lucky

24:45.284 --> 24:47.952
Until i had to drive over
the state line

24:47.954 --> 24:50.354
To come here
to officiate the weddings

24:50.356 --> 24:53.057
Of these two loving couples.

24:57.430 --> 24:58.462
I want to thank you guys.

24:58.464 --> 25:00.431
Santana, britt?

25:00.433 --> 25:02.500
Blaine, kurt?

25:02.502 --> 25:05.336
I want to thank you guys
for being so brave.

25:05.338 --> 25:06.637
And so honest.

25:06.639 --> 25:08.005
And for standing up here

25:08.007 --> 25:09.940
And showing all of us

25:09.942 --> 25:13.177
That love and marriage
is so much bigger

25:13.179 --> 25:15.980
Than we thought it could be.

25:15.982 --> 25:19.383
And also so much simpler.

25:19.385 --> 25:23.053
Love and marriage is when
two people say to one another,

25:23.055 --> 25:24.822
"i love you because i love you,

25:24.824 --> 25:27.491
"and i know this is gonna be
one heck of a ride,

25:27.493 --> 25:29.493
"but i don't want to do it

25:29.495 --> 25:31.795
Unless i can do it with you."

25:32.899 --> 25:36.033
And now, the vows, please.

25:36.035 --> 25:38.869
My husband's in the bathroom
and he's missing all the vows.

25:38.871 --> 25:40.304
Kurt:
Blaine?

25:40.306 --> 25:41.672
I'm a man who's always

25:41.674 --> 25:43.974
Lived in the shadows.

25:43.976 --> 25:45.643
And everyone who's

25:45.645 --> 25:46.844
Come into my life
has always tried

25:46.846 --> 25:48.045
To pull me out into the sun

25:48.047 --> 25:50.247
Or push me back
into the darkness.

25:50.249 --> 25:53.584
I've been bullied, outed
and misunderstood.

25:53.586 --> 25:56.220
I honestly thought that i would
never find real love.

25:56.222 --> 25:58.188
The world seemed
so scary and confusing.

25:58.190 --> 26:00.257
It was just too fast.

26:00.259 --> 26:01.992
It made me feel dumb
just because

26:01.994 --> 26:03.193
My brain worked differently.

26:03.195 --> 26:05.396
And then you came along,
and even if

26:05.398 --> 26:07.932
Someone had told me
that it wasn't gonna work out,

26:07.934 --> 26:10.734
And that at the end
of all of our struggling

26:10.736 --> 26:13.337
And all of our work, it would
just end in heartache...

26:13.339 --> 26:15.005
I would've said yes.

26:15.007 --> 26:16.373
A thousand times yes.

26:16.375 --> 26:17.775
I would've suffered it all

26:17.777 --> 26:19.109
Just for the tiny chance to be

26:19.111 --> 26:21.612
Standing up here marrying you.

26:21.614 --> 26:22.913
I'm a work in progress.

26:22.915 --> 26:24.515
I am a work in progress.

26:24.517 --> 26:25.783
I'm a work in progress.

26:25.785 --> 26:27.351
I'm a work in progress.

26:27.353 --> 26:28.352
Kurt:
You don't ask me

26:28.354 --> 26:29.853
To come out of the shadows.

26:29.855 --> 26:30.888
You help me rip away anything

26:30.890 --> 26:32.623
That's blocking the sun.

26:32.625 --> 26:36.427
It's time for all of us to walk
into the sunshine together.

26:36.429 --> 26:38.362
Forever.

26:38.364 --> 26:39.863
Is that something
you want to do?

26:39.865 --> 26:41.131
I do.

26:41.133 --> 26:42.132
I do.

26:42.134 --> 26:43.067
I do.

26:43.069 --> 26:44.101
I do.

26:58.484 --> 27:01.652
And now by the power vested
in me by the internet

27:01.654 --> 27:03.487
And the state of indiana

27:03.489 --> 27:05.489
And under a god who for sure

27:05.491 --> 27:07.124
If he believes in love,

27:07.126 --> 27:08.792
Then he fully endorses

27:08.794 --> 27:12.563
The loving marriages
of these two wonderful couples,

27:12.565 --> 27:13.931
I now pronounce you

27:13.933 --> 27:15.633
Wife and wife

27:15.635 --> 27:17.568
And husband and husband.

27:17.570 --> 27:20.471
You may kiss one another.

27:20.473 --> 27:23.340
(whooping and cheering)

27:59.011 --> 28:01.145
Hello. My name's pierce pierce.

28:01.147 --> 28:03.113
And i'm brittany's father.

28:03.115 --> 28:05.616
Uh, i was just told
that i was expected

28:05.618 --> 28:07.985
To stand up and give a toaster.

28:07.987 --> 28:11.789
But, uh, i just called target,
and they're closed, so...

28:11.791 --> 28:14.725
Instead i'd just like
to say a few words.

28:14.727 --> 28:17.161
Brittany?

28:17.163 --> 28:18.729
I'm so happy

28:18.731 --> 28:22.199
That you and santana
finally found one another.

28:22.201 --> 28:25.002
You look absolutely
stunning in that gown.

28:25.004 --> 28:28.839
And, um, honestly,
i can speak on behalf

28:28.841 --> 28:30.140
Of my wife...

28:30.142 --> 28:31.975
You're the prettiest one here.

28:31.977 --> 28:34.978
And i don't just think
you're the prettiest.

28:34.980 --> 28:36.814
I think you're the prettiest
by a long shot.

28:36.816 --> 28:39.550
I mean, if you look at all
the other girls here,

28:39.552 --> 28:40.884
There's really no contest.

28:40.886 --> 28:42.319
I mean,

28:42.321 --> 28:44.588
Some of them are
just downright homely.

28:44.590 --> 28:46.690
You know what i'm talking about.

28:46.692 --> 28:48.025
You're-you're blowing it.

28:48.027 --> 28:49.927
And you need to sit down.

28:49.929 --> 28:52.830
'cause nobody is uglier than
you without your clothes on.

28:52.832 --> 28:55.032
Knock it off.

28:55.034 --> 28:57.167
I was just informed

28:57.169 --> 29:00.204
That no one's ugly
and to knock it off!

29:00.206 --> 29:02.372
In closing,

29:02.374 --> 29:05.109
I just want everyone to be
really careful of the candles.

29:05.111 --> 29:08.412
Because with all that dry wood
and hay bales,

29:08.414 --> 29:10.514
This place could go up
like a blowtorch.

29:10.516 --> 29:13.584
And we'd all be dead in minutes.

29:13.586 --> 29:15.519
<i>Salud.</i>
(whoops)

29:15.521 --> 29:17.988
<i>Salud.</i>

29:21.393 --> 29:23.227
All right, everyone,
so, uh, at this time,

29:23.229 --> 29:25.429
We would normally
be serving dinner.

29:25.431 --> 29:27.097
But, um, before we do that,

29:27.099 --> 29:29.800
We have a gift for each
and every one of you.

29:29.802 --> 29:32.603
So, in case you're basic
and you don't know,

29:32.605 --> 29:34.938
Otp stands
for "one true pairing."

29:34.940 --> 29:36.774
And i've been lucking enough

29:36.776 --> 29:38.809
To find mine with brittany.

29:38.811 --> 29:41.912
And kurt and blaine were lucky
to find each other.

29:41.914 --> 29:44.214
And so in the spirit of everyone
here finding their otp,

29:44.216 --> 29:46.416
Please join us
on the dance floor.

29:46.418 --> 29:48.452
And let's get
this party started.

29:48.454 --> 29:50.621

Great day, huh?
Oh, the best.

31:39.431 --> 31:42.599
Hey, promise me you won't leave
until we get at least one dance.

31:42.601 --> 31:43.734
Of course. Uh, mike, wait!

31:43.736 --> 31:44.835
Do you have a second?

31:44.837 --> 31:46.169
I-i need to ask you something.

31:46.171 --> 31:47.070
Yeah.

31:47.072 --> 31:49.039
Okay.

31:49.041 --> 31:50.307
(door closes)

31:54.380 --> 31:56.179
Uh, mike?
(laughs)

31:56.181 --> 31:59.116
Not a day goes by that
i don't think about you.

31:59.118 --> 32:01.752
And i thought being away
from you all these years

32:01.754 --> 32:05.188
Would make me forget the love
that we had together, but...

32:05.190 --> 32:07.257
It's only made me love you more.

32:07.259 --> 32:10.260
I want to spend every day
of my life with you, and...

32:10.262 --> 32:12.796
Well, i've forgotten half of the
things that i wanted to say,

32:12.798 --> 32:15.198
So, um...

32:16.902 --> 32:19.036
Michael robert chang jr.,

32:19.038 --> 32:20.938
Will you marry me?

32:20.940 --> 32:23.774
I-i know you're probably
freaked out right now!

32:23.776 --> 32:26.076
I-i would be, too, and
obviously you don't have

32:26.078 --> 32:28.045
To give me an answer right
now, and-and we don't have

32:28.047 --> 32:30.547
To get married any time soon.
We can both finish college.

32:30.549 --> 32:32.616
And i just...

32:32.618 --> 32:34.885
I just love you so much.

32:36.155 --> 32:37.721
(short laugh)

32:37.723 --> 32:39.756
I love you, too.

32:39.758 --> 32:43.126
B-but, tina...

32:43.128 --> 32:44.628
I can't marry you.

32:44.630 --> 32:45.996
Oh, my god.

32:47.099 --> 32:48.465
This was so stupid.

32:48.467 --> 32:49.766
I'm so stupid.

32:49.768 --> 32:51.568
I mean, what kind of
idiot does this?!

32:51.570 --> 32:52.836
You.

32:52.838 --> 32:54.404
But you're not an idiot.

32:54.406 --> 32:57.674
Look, i think about you
all the time, too.

32:57.676 --> 32:59.943
And-and every time i do,

32:59.945 --> 33:01.745
I smile.

33:01.747 --> 33:03.780
And it means the world to me

33:03.782 --> 33:05.582
That we reconnected
this past year.

33:05.584 --> 33:09.152
And i love how smart,
funny and sexy you are.

33:09.154 --> 33:10.787
(groans)

33:10.789 --> 33:13.991
I... Yeah.

33:13.993 --> 33:15.592
I said "sexy."

33:15.594 --> 33:16.960
And i've felt that way
ever since that summer

33:16.962 --> 33:18.261
We made out
at asian camp.

33:21.166 --> 33:22.432
When four of our
best friends

33:22.434 --> 33:23.934
Get married on
the same day,

33:23.936 --> 33:26.269
I-it's only natural
to want what they have.

33:26.271 --> 33:28.538
We have our whole
lives ahead of us.

33:28.540 --> 33:31.341
And who knows where
we'll be in a year?

33:31.343 --> 33:32.876
But there's a million
guys out there

33:32.878 --> 33:34.311
Who would be so...
Yeah, i know.

33:34.313 --> 33:36.613
I get it.

33:45.024 --> 33:47.858
I would like to propose

33:47.860 --> 33:49.960
That we go in there
and have our dance.

33:49.962 --> 33:51.628
(exhales)

33:51.630 --> 33:52.996
(sniffs)

33:52.998 --> 33:55.766
Well, i accept your proposal.

33:58.804 --> 34:00.370
Well, i didn't really propose.

34:00.372 --> 34:01.872
It was like, you just...
Oh, stop it.

34:01.874 --> 34:03.340
Where'd you get that ring,
by the way?

34:03.342 --> 34:05.008
Mrs. Lopez:
Come on, come on, come on.

34:05.010 --> 34:06.843
This party's
on fire!

34:06.845 --> 34:09.212
(guests cheering)

34:09.214 --> 34:11.548
And we whipped up
a little number for you.

34:11.550 --> 34:14.718
And we have some
very special guests:

34:14.720 --> 34:17.020
The treble tones!

34:17.022 --> 34:19.890
(the pointer sisters'
"i'm so excited" begins)

34:26.932 --> 34:32.002
¶ tonight's the night
we're gonna make it happen ¶

34:32.004 --> 34:36.073

36:41.800 --> 36:45.068
(cheering, whooping)

36:53.745 --> 36:56.246
Kurt:
If i could just steal your
attention for one moment.

36:56.248 --> 36:58.248
On behalf of our
inspirational brides,

36:58.250 --> 37:00.417
My husband and i-- whoa,
that was weird to say.

37:00.419 --> 37:02.586
It's weird.
Uh, we would like
to say thank you.

37:02.588 --> 37:04.854
Thank you, thank you
so much to all of our family

37:04.856 --> 37:07.857
And to all of our friends
for showing us, by example,

37:07.859 --> 37:09.593
That real love
is worth waiting for.

37:09.595 --> 37:11.328
And worth fighting for.

37:11.330 --> 37:13.330
Kurt:
We would like to dedicate
the next song

37:13.332 --> 37:16.266
To all the couples in the room,
be it official or unofficial.

37:16.268 --> 37:18.835
All right. So all couples
to the dance floor, please.
Blaine: Come on.

37:18.837 --> 37:21.238
(ruby & the romantics'
"our day will come" begins)

37:25.344 --> 37:29.446
¶ our day will come ¶

37:29.448 --> 37:33.583

37:35.621 --> 37:40.056

37:48.100 --> 37:52.068

37:52.070 --> 37:54.271

38:09.955 --> 38:15.058

38:46.124 --> 38:50.860

39:22.894 --> 39:25.295
(cheering)

39:26.965 --> 39:29.599
(talking, laughing)

39:39.644 --> 39:42.679
Oh... I thought we were doing
takeout on the risers.

39:42.681 --> 39:44.547
We could've went
to a real restaurant.

39:44.549 --> 39:46.349
I was feeling
nostalgic.

39:46.351 --> 39:48.351
I wanted to relive
our tuesday lunches.

39:48.353 --> 39:49.285
Hmm.

39:50.889 --> 39:52.188
How are you doing?

39:52.190 --> 39:54.324
Meh.

39:54.326 --> 39:56.226
I know you think i'm crazy

39:56.228 --> 39:57.494
For proposing to mike.

39:57.496 --> 39:59.362
But it's...
It's a little hard,

39:59.364 --> 40:01.431
Seeing all these fun,
exciting things

40:01.433 --> 40:02.699
Happening to your friends

40:02.701 --> 40:04.033
And not getting
a little jealous.

40:04.035 --> 40:05.068
I mean,

40:05.070 --> 40:06.536
Look at kurt and blaine

40:06.538 --> 40:07.837
And how spontaneous they were

40:07.839 --> 40:09.406
And how everything
just worked out.

40:09.408 --> 40:10.573
I wish,

40:10.575 --> 40:12.242
Just for once, that could be me.

40:12.244 --> 40:13.910
No one loves
being alone.

40:13.912 --> 40:15.612
I know i don't.

40:15.614 --> 40:17.414
But i also know you can't
just force yourself

40:17.416 --> 40:18.681
To be in a
relationship

40:18.683 --> 40:19.916
To avoid it.

40:19.918 --> 40:21.384
I mean, that's
how you miss out

40:21.386 --> 40:23.219
On finding the perfect
person for you.

40:23.221 --> 40:25.622
I mean, if you hadn't dumped me,

40:25.624 --> 40:27.257
You never would've
started dating mike.

40:27.259 --> 40:29.225
Um, excuse me,
you broke up with me.

40:29.227 --> 40:30.460
No.

40:30.462 --> 40:31.628
Because i had a fake stutter?

40:31.630 --> 40:33.630
Stop. That is not what
happened at all.

40:33.632 --> 40:35.031
I never would've
broken up with you.

40:35.033 --> 40:36.766
You're awesome.
Ugh...

40:36.768 --> 40:38.968
I'm sure i'll be fine
being alone forever...

40:38.970 --> 40:40.303
Tina, your problem

40:40.305 --> 40:42.439
Is that you always
worry too much.

40:42.441 --> 40:44.040
You're not going
to spend your life alone.

40:44.042 --> 40:45.074
How can you be sure?

40:45.076 --> 40:46.876
Mmm...

40:47.879 --> 40:49.712
How about this?

40:49.714 --> 40:52.115
Let's make a pact.

40:52.117 --> 40:55.418
If we're both not married by 30,

40:55.420 --> 40:57.287
We'll marry each other.

40:57.289 --> 41:00.457
Oh, my god, artie, yes!
(laughing)

41:00.459 --> 41:02.492
We love each other,
our sexual chemistry

41:02.494 --> 41:04.327
Is undeniable...
Uh-huh.

41:04.329 --> 41:05.595
Oh.
See?

41:05.597 --> 41:06.996
...And our kids

41:06.998 --> 41:08.264
Are pretty much
guaranteed

41:08.266 --> 41:09.499
To get into
every preschool.

41:09.501 --> 41:10.767
Okay.

41:10.769 --> 41:12.969
I officially accept
your invitation

41:12.971 --> 41:14.504
To be your backup fiancée.

41:14.506 --> 41:15.939
(laughs)
how romantic.

41:15.941 --> 41:17.240
(laughs)

41:17.242 --> 41:18.475
I mean,

41:18.477 --> 41:20.076
I think
everyone needs

41:20.078 --> 41:22.078
A little more tartie
in their lives.

41:22.080 --> 41:24.314
I think we're more artina.

41:24.316 --> 41:25.815
Look at us.

41:25.817 --> 41:27.417
Already putting the
other person first.

41:27.419 --> 41:29.486
That's a sign of
a healthy relationship.

41:29.488 --> 41:31.354
Here's to always having somebody

41:31.356 --> 41:32.789
Amazing to roll with.

41:32.791 --> 41:35.091
And as we know,
no one rolls better than me.

41:35.093 --> 41:36.326
(both laughing)

41:36.328 --> 41:37.727
Cheers.
Cheers.

41:39.531 --> 41:40.997
Okay, sue.

41:40.999 --> 41:42.599
We know
you're in here.

41:42.601 --> 41:45.335
You can come out now.

41:45.337 --> 41:46.836
Sue:
Well, well, well.

41:46.838 --> 41:49.873
If it isn't my gender-gentle
anderhummels

41:49.875 --> 41:52.375
And the autistically feisty
lopierces.

41:52.377 --> 41:54.177
(sue chuckles)

41:54.179 --> 41:56.145
Sue, we appreciate the very
strange lengths you went

41:56.147 --> 41:58.348
To push us both
to the altar, but...

41:58.350 --> 41:59.382
What are we doing here?

41:59.384 --> 42:01.718
Well, i have one last gift

42:01.720 --> 42:04.387
For both of you,
my legacy couples,

42:04.389 --> 42:06.289
And i wanted to give them
to you myself.

42:06.291 --> 42:07.524
(chuckles)

42:07.526 --> 42:09.859
Don't worry, it's not a song.

42:09.861 --> 42:12.128
Or a minority choir.

42:12.130 --> 42:14.797
Now, i realize,
uh...

42:14.799 --> 42:18.568
That you all see me as
a driven, richly complex,

42:18.570 --> 42:20.136
Emotionally bipolar
role model,

42:20.138 --> 42:21.971
But after
all these years,

42:21.973 --> 42:25.675
I can't help but see you
as my own kids.

42:25.677 --> 42:28.511
Inside each of your envelopes
you will find your very own

42:28.513 --> 42:29.879
Honeymoon showcase showdown.

42:29.881 --> 42:31.347
Oh, but we already
booked a honeymoon.

42:31.349 --> 42:33.516
Oh, but i canceled
that honeymoon.

42:33.518 --> 42:36.319
A weekend trip
to provincetown?

42:36.321 --> 42:38.521
Staying in andrew sullivan's
cabana house? Wow!

42:38.523 --> 42:40.690
Sue:
Well, andrew's an old friend
of mine. Or he used to be.

42:40.692 --> 42:42.325
We're not speaking now;
it's a long story.

42:42.327 --> 42:43.993
A month-long,
all-expenses-paid trip

42:43.995 --> 42:45.495
To the atlantis resort
on paradise island

42:45.497 --> 42:47.497
In the bahamas.
In the bahamas.

42:47.499 --> 42:49.165
Oh, my gosh, no way!
That's where wonder
woman was born!

42:49.167 --> 42:50.900
Lassos of truth included!
(babbling)

42:50.902 --> 42:52.101
It's crazy!

42:52.103 --> 42:53.102
Oh, my god...
Thank you.

42:53.104 --> 42:54.737
Sue:
Live, love, prosper.

42:54.739 --> 42:56.005
And i've gotta come up with

42:56.007 --> 42:57.173
Some new
shipper fodder.

42:57.175 --> 42:58.841
Hmm. How 'bout puckcedes?

42:58.843 --> 43:00.710
How's that? Or faberry?

43:00.712 --> 43:01.945
Can't get enough
of the lesbians.

43:01.947 --> 43:03.580
You're the best.
The bahamas! The bahamas.

43:03.582 --> 43:05.281
Sue:
Faberry...

43:05.283 --> 43:06.916
I can't believe we
actually did this.

43:06.918 --> 43:08.918
I can't believe
we survived that party.

43:08.920 --> 43:10.920
Brittany:
Oh, my gosh...

43:10.922 --> 43:12.956
I can't believe we have
the same anniversary now.

43:12.958 --> 43:14.724
I can't... Wait, hold up.
What was that?

43:14.726 --> 43:16.392
Yeah, you guys, we're
in this together now.

43:16.394 --> 43:18.728
Okay? You can count on us. And i
think we should make a pact,

43:18.730 --> 43:20.063
To, um, celebrate our
anniversaries together

43:20.065 --> 43:21.464
Every year for the
rest of our lives.

43:21.466 --> 43:22.699
Or maybe like
every fifth year?

43:22.701 --> 43:24.267
Fifth. Okay.
That's okay.

43:24.269 --> 43:26.035
It's a little much
to do it every year.
Or skype...

43:26.037 --> 43:28.037
We can skype, like,
every year or something.
Sure...

43:28.039 --> 43:29.105
