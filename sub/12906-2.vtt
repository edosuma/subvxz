37:24.017 --> 37:28.087
I know my mother and I
are a little close.

37:28.122 --> 37:30.489
I get it if you want
to run away screaming.

37:30.524 --> 37:32.791
Your mother's great.

37:32.826 --> 37:35.093
I can see why you want
to spend time with her.

37:44.204 --> 37:45.670
See you soon?

You know where I live.

[Door opens, closes]

37:54.380 --> 37:55.679
You like her, don't you?

37:55.715 --> 37:58.649
Yeah, I really do.

37:58.684 --> 38:00.851
I like her, too...
a lot.

[Chuckles]

38:01.988 --> 38:03.954
But not for you.

Mrs. Delatour,
Marisol Suarez to see you.

38:15.901 --> 38:17.701
Oh.

38:17.737 --> 38:20.638
How lovely of you to stop by.

38:20.673 --> 38:21.673
That will be all, Miguel.

38:24.075 --> 38:27.377
Why is Rosie's son
answering your front door?

38:27.412 --> 38:29.379
I've taken him under my wing.

38:29.414 --> 38:31.714
Turns out
he has great potential.

38:31.750 --> 38:33.517
And he's an excellent driver.

38:33.552 --> 38:35.218
Would you like to sit?

38:35.254 --> 38:37.320
No.
No, I'm not staying.

38:37.356 --> 38:40.556
I just wanted to let you know
that I've thought

38:40.591 --> 38:42.992
about the situation with Peter.

38:43.028 --> 38:44.727
I knew you'd come around.

38:44.763 --> 38:46.896
I'm not breaking up with him.

38:48.232 --> 38:52.735
He's great, and I think I owe it
to myself to see where it goes.

38:52.771 --> 38:55.504
Oh, I see.

38:56.874 --> 38:59.908
Well, I appreciate
your telling me that in person.

38:59.943 --> 39:01.743
I really don't want
to hurt you,

to be up front and honest.

39:05.216 --> 39:06.715
Of course.

39:06.750 --> 39:10.586

of me to ask of you anyway.

[Sighs]

39:13.123 --> 39:14.422
So, you understand?

39:14.457 --> 39:16.758
I do.
Completely.

39:16.794 --> 39:18.093
Thank you.

It's such a relief.

Just one more thing.

Well, I'm not sure what

like discussing it...

That's why Daniela
tried to seduce me.

Very clever.

Evelyn, we were meant
to be together.

I was willing to stay in
that chair forever to keep you.

Look at the lengths
you went to entrap me.

40:06.475 --> 40:09.109
There was a time when
that sort of cat-and-mouse

40:09.144 --> 40:10.844
excited me,
but now I'm tired of it.

40:10.879 --> 40:12.446
I'm tired of you!

so deliciously twisted.

match me blow for blow.

Well, I'm sorry, Adrian,
but from now on,

And how did you get
this stripper

to say what you
needed her to say?
