WEBVTT

00:00.332 --> 00:01.932
Previously on Warehouse 13...

00:01.942 --> 00:05.562
Hello.
I have a special...Order.

00:05.624 --> 00:06.757
- You have a date?
- No.

00:06.825 --> 00:08.259
Be yourself.

00:08.326 --> 00:09.760
So what High School
did you go to?

00:09.828 --> 00:11.262
Why all the questions
about my past?

00:11.329 --> 00:12.663
What am I doing here?

00:12.731 --> 00:13.631
I got--
oh!

00:15.000 --> 00:16.500
What kind of advice
is "be yourself"?

00:16.568 --> 00:20.104
Because myself
is a giant freakazoid.

00:20.172 --> 00:21.672
When you said
"meet me at the diner,"

00:21.740 --> 00:23.607
I thought you'd arranged some
lame meet with me and Todd.

00:24.230 --> 00:25.350
Todd.

00:26.321 --> 00:27.721
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:28.965 --> 00:31.365
- Get out.
- Yeah. Leaving.

00:33.000 --> 00:39.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:43.808 --> 00:45.409
My lips can't focus.
I'm too excited.

00:45.477 --> 00:47.478
Me too.
I know.

00:47.546 --> 00:51.115
The Warehouse is finally getting
a computer upgrade.

00:51.183 --> 00:53.384
Right.

00:53.451 --> 00:56.353
The IRS Warehouse
where you work.

00:56.421 --> 00:58.589
Exciting.
Very exciting.

00:58.657 --> 00:59.857
I know, right?

00:59.925 --> 01:01.392
That place has been running
on a first-gen

01:01.459 --> 01:04.227
8-bit GUI since, like,
the stone ages.

01:04.296 --> 01:05.696
Oh, I'm so sorry.

01:05.764 --> 01:07.364
I keep forgetting you're
not a high-tech kind of guy.

01:07.432 --> 01:09.166
Hey, I'm pumped
if you're pumped.

01:09.234 --> 01:11.035
But my computer skills
go as far as

01:11.102 --> 01:13.170
getting new ring tones
for my cell phone.

01:13.238 --> 01:16.340
You're cute for a Luddite.

01:16.408 --> 01:17.508
Oh, yikes.

01:17.576 --> 01:19.109
I'm late.

01:19.177 --> 01:21.712
Got this guy coming
to install the new system.

01:21.780 --> 01:24.848
Some mucky-muck from some place
called Global Dynamics.

01:24.916 --> 01:25.916
Catch up later?

01:25.984 --> 01:27.918
I could bring lunch.

01:27.986 --> 01:30.054
Crustless PB&J, Twinkies,
and Doritos?

01:30.121 --> 01:31.589
And an orange for fiber.

01:31.656 --> 01:34.024
Mmm, that's why
I loves me some Todd.

01:40.432 --> 01:42.733
W-w-what?

01:42.801 --> 01:44.635
What are you do--
what are you doing?

01:44.703 --> 01:47.171
Do you have any idea
what you're doing?

01:47.239 --> 01:49.540
Look, I was asked
to upgrade this place

01:49.608 --> 01:51.475
to class seven standards
and I can't do that

01:51.543 --> 01:52.676
with you constantly
interrupting me.

01:52.744 --> 01:53.877
Adapt.

01:53.945 --> 01:55.479
This is not Eureka.

01:55.547 --> 01:56.480
I will not have you
gutting my system.

01:56.548 --> 01:58.716
Your guts are rotted.

01:58.783 --> 02:01.418
All right, every single wire
has to go exactly back

02:01.486 --> 02:03.053
where it was.

02:03.121 --> 02:04.355
Half of these aren't
even wires.

02:04.422 --> 02:05.756
This one looks like shoelace.

02:05.824 --> 02:06.690
All right, let me
be perfectly clear.

02:10.395 --> 02:11.895
Hey-o!
If you damage any of my data,

02:11.963 --> 02:13.264
you will not come
within an inch--

02:13.331 --> 02:14.932
Artie, Artie, Artie, Artie.
Artie?

02:15.000 --> 02:17.101
Artie, why don't we let
our special guest,

02:17.168 --> 02:19.436
who I bet Mrs. Frederic
wouldn't have sent here

02:19.504 --> 02:21.905
if he was trouble,
do his thing, huh?

02:21.973 --> 02:23.507
Come on, buddy.

02:23.575 --> 02:24.942
Yeah, he's a Global
Dynamic geek.

02:25.010 --> 02:25.876
I know.
He's soulless.

02:25.944 --> 02:27.444
He's made up of binary numbers.

02:27.512 --> 02:28.746
Yeah.

02:28.813 --> 02:31.115
I'll tear his heart out.

02:38.757 --> 02:41.392
Hello?

02:41.459 --> 02:43.961
Wire in the hole.

02:44.029 --> 02:46.797
I drop stuff down there
all the time.

02:54.539 --> 02:57.074
Hold on to me, will you?

03:08.653 --> 03:11.021
I'm Claudia,
resident tech girl.

03:11.089 --> 03:12.623
Uh, Douglas.
Douglas Fargo.

03:12.691 --> 03:14.124
Everyone just calls me Fargo.

03:14.192 --> 03:16.927
Okay...Doug.

03:16.995 --> 03:18.896
Neat gizmo, huh?
Yeah.

03:18.963 --> 03:20.764
Um, what makes it glow?

03:20.832 --> 03:23.133
Is it, like,
a phosphorous compound?

03:23.201 --> 03:24.968
No, it belonged
to Ben Franklin.

03:25.036 --> 03:27.938
Amplifies human energy to--

03:28.006 --> 03:29.340
first time in the Warehouse?

03:29.407 --> 03:31.241
Until the scary lady
with the beehive showed up,

03:31.309 --> 03:35.112
I kind of thought Warehouse 13
was just an Internet rumor.

03:35.180 --> 03:38.949
So, um, any chance after
I'm done with the install,

03:39.017 --> 03:41.318
I could get a tour?

03:41.386 --> 03:42.586
Ooh, no can do, outlander.

03:42.654 --> 03:45.155
You've only got blue level
clearance.

03:45.223 --> 03:46.690
I have to ask.

03:46.758 --> 03:48.792
Is this--
gasp.

03:48.860 --> 03:50.327
Better than gasp.

03:50.395 --> 03:52.296
This is gonna replace
all of that.

03:52.364 --> 03:54.465
It's from Global Dynamics,
where I work.

03:54.532 --> 03:55.833
Well, run, I guess.

03:55.900 --> 03:57.034
Yeah, I'm in charge.

03:57.102 --> 03:58.635
What about this thing?

03:58.703 --> 04:00.270
Ah, it's a M.A.R.A.

04:00.338 --> 04:01.772
A maintenance
and repair automaton.

04:01.840 --> 04:04.208
It's for use in unmanned
space stations,

04:04.275 --> 04:06.110
large facilities.

04:06.177 --> 04:07.511
I--I actually invented it.

04:07.579 --> 04:09.680
But, um, I was gonna install
it with your system,

04:09.748 --> 04:12.149
but your boss vetoed it.

04:12.217 --> 04:13.384
Yeah, Artie would have
vetoed fire

04:13.451 --> 04:15.018
if he'd been born just
a couple years earlier.

04:17.122 --> 04:21.825
So you ready to fire up
Warehouse 13.1 or what?

04:21.892 --> 04:24.828
Let's get this over with.

04:24.896 --> 04:30.701
Okay, shutting down
the old systems now.

04:35.874 --> 04:39.209
And bring in the new.

04:49.621 --> 04:53.424
Anybody gonna ask me
to dance?

04:53.491 --> 04:55.826
What exactly did you do?

04:55.894 --> 04:58.562
The new O.S. should have
come right on.

04:58.630 --> 05:01.432
Oh, really?

05:13.578 --> 05:18.148
I hope that means
we can't park here.

05:23.488 --> 05:27.658
Catastrophic failure detected.

05:27.725 --> 05:29.960
"Catastrophic" is a bad word.

05:39.204 --> 05:46.977

06:19.718 --> 06:23.054
Those eyes are popping up
all over the Warehouse.

06:23.986 --> 06:25.586
Is this thing looking at me?

06:25.654 --> 06:26.554
And what are they doing?

06:26.622 --> 06:28.089
I think they're watching us.

06:28.157 --> 06:30.091
This is all your fault,
Bismarck.

06:30.159 --> 06:32.393
Fargo.
And it is not my fault.

06:32.461 --> 06:33.528
When we shut down
the old system,

06:33.595 --> 06:35.396
some sort of fail-safe activated.

06:35.464 --> 06:36.831
I'm completely locked out.

06:36.899 --> 06:39.067
You didn't think to mention
there was a fail-safe?

06:39.134 --> 06:40.868
No, I didn't know there
was a fail-safe.

06:40.936 --> 06:43.271
And aren't so-called computer
experts supposed to realize that

06:43.338 --> 06:44.739
before you shut down a system?

06:44.807 --> 06:46.441
Okay, boys,
take it outside.

06:46.508 --> 06:49.844
Let me work a little
Claudiosity.

06:49.912 --> 06:51.245
I never should have
let you in here.

06:51.313 --> 06:53.481
Well, it wasn't exactly your
decision now, was it?

06:53.549 --> 06:55.216
Hey.
Oh, no, you didn't.

06:55.284 --> 06:59.187
It's not coming from
this office.

06:59.254 --> 07:03.257
All systems functioning
within acceptable parameters.

07:03.325 --> 07:05.293
That voice.

07:05.360 --> 07:09.697
I recognize that voice.

07:09.765 --> 07:11.065
That's Hugo Miller's voice.

07:11.133 --> 07:12.600
Who?

07:12.668 --> 07:17.839
He was the original designer
of the Warehouse systems.

07:17.906 --> 07:19.307
Where are you going?

07:19.374 --> 07:22.643
Um, the computer lab.

07:22.711 --> 07:26.013
You have a computer lab?

07:26.081 --> 07:28.316
More like a computer morgue.

07:28.383 --> 07:30.551
You didn't think to mention
there was a computer lab?

07:30.619 --> 07:33.788
Well, later on,
I'll make a list for you

07:33.856 --> 07:37.692
of all the things that
I didn't think to mention.

07:37.759 --> 07:39.527
Has this been running
the entire time?

07:39.595 --> 07:40.962
No, no, of course not.

07:41.029 --> 07:44.065
Place has been shut down
for 35 years.

07:44.133 --> 07:46.467
So why is it--
you know what?

07:46.535 --> 07:47.568
Spread out,
don't touch anything,

07:47.636 --> 07:48.970
but look for an off switch.

07:49.037 --> 07:50.938
Who was Hugo Miller?

07:51.006 --> 07:54.075
Brilliant man and more than
a little devious.

07:54.143 --> 07:56.744
He actually encouraged
Bill Gates to go

07:56.812 --> 07:59.313
in one direction while
pushing Steve Jobs

07:59.381 --> 08:03.384
to go in another.

08:03.452 --> 08:05.286
Hey.

08:05.354 --> 08:07.321
Hey.

08:07.389 --> 08:09.790
Hugo spent years down
here integrating

08:09.858 --> 08:12.593
the whole Warehouse into
a workable platform.

08:16.865 --> 08:17.999
Looks like he spent
a lot of time

08:18.066 --> 08:23.070
playing with himself too.

08:23.138 --> 08:25.706
No way!

08:25.774 --> 08:27.542
Awesome.
Lemon launch.

08:27.609 --> 08:28.743
Pete.

08:28.810 --> 08:30.077
Pete, that's been here
for years.

08:30.145 --> 08:31.546
If I were you,
I'd put that down.

08:31.613 --> 08:33.714
Hugo was a huge practical joker.

08:33.782 --> 08:36.851
He'd leave exploding cans
of pop everywhere.

08:36.919 --> 08:38.519
Used to drive everybody nuts.

08:38.587 --> 08:41.289
Artie, what happened to him?

08:41.356 --> 08:42.456
He retired.

08:42.524 --> 08:45.159
Hello, blinky.

08:50.032 --> 08:51.966
Oh, that's the fail-safe.

08:52.034 --> 08:54.202
There must be a main power
junction.

08:54.269 --> 08:55.603
Oh!

08:55.671 --> 08:57.138
You all right?

08:57.206 --> 08:59.574
I've been hit with worse.

08:59.641 --> 09:02.043
Are you sure?

09:02.110 --> 09:04.946
Wow, this thing is tied
in to the fail-safe.

09:05.013 --> 09:06.480
Whoa.
Take a gander.

09:06.548 --> 09:08.516
It's uploading a massive amount
of data from our mainframe.

09:08.584 --> 09:11.986
Whatever it is,
I think it's moving in.

09:12.054 --> 09:15.890
This fail-safe is hardwired
into the whole system,

09:15.958 --> 09:18.392
into the temperature regulators,
the security feeds,

09:18.460 --> 09:20.094
into the neutralizer pump.

09:20.162 --> 09:21.329
Maybe that's okay.

09:21.396 --> 09:23.097
We were installing
a new computer anyway.

09:23.165 --> 09:25.299
Well, one we can control.

09:25.367 --> 09:27.602
Why don't we just
bring Hugo Miller here?

09:27.669 --> 09:30.605
I told you he's retired.

09:30.672 --> 09:32.340
Retired or...

09:32.407 --> 09:33.841
No, he's alive.
Don't be dramatic.

09:33.909 --> 09:37.111
There were rumors about
a nervous breakdown, but--

09:37.179 --> 09:39.013
well, sitting
in a windowless room

09:39.081 --> 09:40.948
for ten years playing
Monopoly with Hal?

09:41.016 --> 09:42.617
What could go wrong?

09:42.684 --> 09:43.985
Do we know where
he retired to?

09:44.052 --> 09:46.153
Place called Hutchinson.
It's in Featherhead.

09:46.221 --> 09:48.322
Featherhead?
That's two hours away.

09:48.390 --> 09:50.391
We should at least
go talk to him.

09:50.459 --> 09:53.294
It's worth a try.

10:06.041 --> 10:07.975
Yeah, I think
I could "retire" here.

10:08.043 --> 10:09.543
Well, let's check you
in then.

10:09.611 --> 10:11.479
Hugo doesn't get
many visitors.

10:13.615 --> 10:18.753
Just give me a moment.

10:18.820 --> 10:21.689
Okay.

10:21.757 --> 10:24.492
I wonder if they give
sponge baths here.

10:24.559 --> 10:26.961
Do you know every former
Warehouse Agent

10:27.029 --> 10:30.164
we've ever known is either
crazy, evil, or dead?

10:30.232 --> 10:33.301
Or all three.

10:33.368 --> 10:36.037
You can come in now.

10:36.104 --> 10:38.506
Mr. Miller, we're from the--

10:38.573 --> 10:41.142
I know who you are.

10:41.209 --> 10:45.212
You're President
Ulysses S. Grant

10:45.280 --> 10:46.547
and the snowman.

10:46.615 --> 10:49.850
You've come because
it's Arbor Day

10:49.918 --> 10:53.020
and there aren't enough zippers
to go around.

10:53.088 --> 10:55.823
Well, at least
he's not evil or dead.

10:58.593 --> 11:00.695
Yet.

11:04.833 --> 11:07.601
Hugo?

11:07.669 --> 11:12.606
We have some questions about
something you built years ago.

11:12.674 --> 11:14.642
A, um, backup computer system?

11:14.710 --> 11:16.977
It went round and round

11:17.045 --> 11:19.680
and spinning and spinning

11:19.748 --> 11:22.283
and dancing and flying.

11:22.351 --> 11:24.352
This is not gonna
be a standard interview.

11:24.419 --> 11:25.686
No.
No, it's not.

11:25.754 --> 11:29.457
The Koala Bear
is actually a Marsupial.

11:29.524 --> 11:30.758
Well,
system's functioning

11:30.826 --> 11:35.129
within acceptable parameters.

11:35.197 --> 11:37.131
Recovery fail-safe is active.

11:37.199 --> 11:39.667
Yes, Hugo.
Exactly.

11:39.735 --> 11:41.168
Exactly.
The fail-safe.

11:41.236 --> 11:43.170
How do we shut it off?

11:43.238 --> 11:45.639
You don't have the code.

11:45.707 --> 11:49.677
Agent Miller,
President Grant is ordering you

11:49.745 --> 11:51.545
to give us the code.

11:51.613 --> 11:53.714
Of course, Mr. President.

11:53.782 --> 11:56.517
But I must be paid in bicycles.

11:56.585 --> 11:57.952
Can do.

11:58.019 --> 11:59.453
Mm-hmm.

12:03.959 --> 12:05.626
I'm not paying
a bicycle for that.

12:05.694 --> 12:07.862
You know,
maybe we should just

12:07.929 --> 12:09.063
take him back to the Warehouse.

12:09.131 --> 12:11.332
Warehouse 13?

12:11.400 --> 12:13.801
Yeah, yeah.
You remember Warehouse 13?

12:13.869 --> 12:17.571
The spinning
and the dancing...

12:17.639 --> 12:19.607
And--and the boxes.

12:19.674 --> 12:23.110
If he sees the Warehouse,
he may remember the code.

12:23.178 --> 12:24.745
What do you think
about that, buddy, huh?

12:24.813 --> 12:28.616
Can we get ice cream?

12:28.683 --> 12:30.217
Uh--
yeah.

12:30.285 --> 12:32.720
Yeah, if that's what you want.

12:32.788 --> 12:33.921
Definitely.
Ice cream.

12:33.989 --> 12:35.055
Okay.

12:35.123 --> 12:36.524
Ice cream.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

12:36.591 --> 12:37.491
Whoa, Hugo.
Hey!

12:38.560 --> 12:39.960
No.

13:00.916 --> 13:02.082
We got everything
on Hugo Miller.

13:02.150 --> 13:03.918
Excellent.
Is it hard to find?

13:03.985 --> 13:05.453
Uh, yes and no.

13:05.520 --> 13:06.787
Okay, perfect.

13:06.855 --> 13:09.623
All we have to do
is go through and follow--

13:09.691 --> 13:10.624
redacted.

13:10.692 --> 13:11.859
Who would do that?

13:11.927 --> 13:13.828
The Regents.
Crossing things out.

13:13.895 --> 13:15.196
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

13:15.263 --> 13:18.032
They found Hugo collapsed
on aisle Allentown-22C.

13:18.099 --> 13:19.733
Cited it as mental exhaustion.

13:19.801 --> 13:25.172
Uh, guys, it's finishing.

13:25.240 --> 13:28.976
Please don't blow up.

13:31.746 --> 13:34.448
Oh, that wasn't so bad.

13:34.516 --> 13:37.051
No, we're still locked out.

13:40.088 --> 13:41.188
Is that--

13:41.256 --> 13:43.724
Hugo.

13:43.792 --> 13:45.025
It's Agent Miller.

13:45.093 --> 13:48.295
Agent Nielsen, I am Hugo One.

13:48.363 --> 13:52.399
I assume control in the event
of catastrophic failure.

13:52.467 --> 13:55.169
Holographic artificial
intelligence.

13:55.237 --> 13:57.271
Must be one of the earliest
models ever.

13:57.339 --> 13:59.573
That would explain
the Tom Selleck mustache.

13:59.641 --> 14:01.942
We were just installing
a new system.

14:02.010 --> 14:03.611
There is no catastrophic
failure.

14:03.678 --> 14:05.379
I will be the judge of that.

14:05.447 --> 14:06.714
The judge?

14:06.781 --> 14:09.683
My eyes are currently
scanning the Warehouse

14:09.751 --> 14:11.852
for irregularities.

14:11.920 --> 14:14.688
I must also review decades
of artifact retrieval

14:14.756 --> 14:16.590
and personnel files.

14:16.658 --> 14:18.893
Excuse me.

14:18.960 --> 14:20.394
At least he is polite.

14:24.933 --> 14:26.534
Artie, look,
we found Miller, okay,

14:26.601 --> 14:28.002
but he's a complete nutjob.

14:28.069 --> 14:31.739
He kept talking about
spinning and dancing and--

14:31.806 --> 14:33.340
he Tesla'd us, Artie.

14:33.408 --> 14:36.010
Well, his program is some kind
of artificial intelligence.

14:36.077 --> 14:38.345
Bring him back here so he
can turn this thing off.

14:38.413 --> 14:39.914
Yeah, he kind of slipped
away from us,

14:39.981 --> 14:43.517
so we'll call you back
when we get him.

14:43.585 --> 14:44.952
This is very unusual.

14:45.020 --> 14:46.220
He's normally quite docile.

14:46.288 --> 14:47.521
We've checked.

14:47.589 --> 14:48.822
He's not on hospital grounds.

14:48.890 --> 14:50.724
Here are his records
you asked for.

14:50.792 --> 14:52.526
Thank you.

14:52.594 --> 14:53.694
You know, Myka?

14:53.762 --> 14:55.229
Yeah?

14:55.297 --> 14:57.331
This guy couldn't
have spun or danced far.

14:57.399 --> 15:00.868
Spinning and dancing, right?

15:00.936 --> 15:03.704
On the way here we saw a--

15:03.772 --> 15:05.906
I think I might know
where he is.

15:05.974 --> 15:08.375
What? What? What?
What did we solve?

15:11.546 --> 15:14.081
♪ ♪

15:14.149 --> 15:18.018
Hugo, are you okay?

15:18.086 --> 15:19.286
So sad.

15:19.354 --> 15:22.856
It worked last time.

15:22.924 --> 15:23.857
Hey, Hugo?

15:23.925 --> 15:25.993
Hey, buddy.

15:26.061 --> 15:28.262
I'm gonna put these bright,
shiny bracelets on you, okay?

15:28.330 --> 15:31.632
And you can tell us all about it
on the way to the Warehouse.

15:31.700 --> 15:34.602
Yeah?
Come on up.

15:34.669 --> 15:37.571
Yeah, let's do this one first.

15:37.639 --> 15:39.440
Hugo, we really
need your help.

15:39.507 --> 15:43.744
Can't help without
the spinning.

15:43.812 --> 15:45.713
So why would he model
Hugo One after himself?

15:45.780 --> 15:49.683
Lots of programmers do that.

15:49.751 --> 15:51.318
I mean, I never have.

15:51.386 --> 15:53.253
Some others do.

15:53.321 --> 15:56.156
But this is impossible.

15:56.224 --> 15:59.026
When this was developed,
A.I. was just science fiction.

15:59.094 --> 16:00.661
If something seems
impossible,

16:00.729 --> 16:02.896
it usually means there's
an artifact involved.

16:05.433 --> 16:08.268
He's coming back.

16:11.439 --> 16:12.906
I have completed my analysis.

16:12.974 --> 16:14.174
And everything's cool, right?

16:14.242 --> 16:16.677
So you can skedaddle.

16:16.745 --> 16:18.545
Claudia Donovan,
your file shows nine separate

16:18.613 --> 16:19.847
incident reports.

16:19.914 --> 16:21.315
Actually thought
it would be more.

16:21.383 --> 16:22.916
I guess he's got your number.

16:22.984 --> 16:26.220
Douglas Fargo,
your Global Dynamics profile

16:26.287 --> 16:29.156
includes the phrase
"inappropriately pushed button"

16:29.224 --> 16:30.557
38 times.

16:30.625 --> 16:32.660
Wait, wait, wait.
You can access my G.D. file?

16:32.727 --> 16:33.894
No, no, no.

16:33.962 --> 16:35.329
He's accessing
the Warehouse system.

16:35.397 --> 16:37.264
If I can view an ATM in Sweden,
for example,

16:37.332 --> 16:38.799
then so can Hugo One.

16:38.867 --> 16:40.834
Agent Nielsen,
your unconventional

16:40.902 --> 16:42.603
management skills are subpar.

16:42.671 --> 16:44.238
Okay, I've had just
about enough of you.

16:44.305 --> 16:45.839
I have determined the source

16:45.907 --> 16:47.007
of the recent
catastrophic event.

16:47.075 --> 16:48.208
Which is?

16:48.276 --> 16:50.177
The agents who work here.

17:02.023 --> 17:05.925
I have completed my analysis.

17:13.663 --> 17:15.631
Todd?
Hey.

17:15.699 --> 17:17.199
Where are you?

17:17.267 --> 17:18.567
The doritos are getting cold.

17:18.635 --> 17:19.867
Shoot.

17:19.935 --> 17:21.804
Uh, I'm sorry.

17:21.871 --> 17:23.005
Got a bit of an emergency here.

17:23.073 --> 17:24.406
I am gonna have
to resched lunch.

17:24.473 --> 17:25.840
Oh, okay, no problem.

17:25.909 --> 17:27.108
Maybe dinner?

17:27.176 --> 17:28.310
Oh, God, I hope so.

17:28.377 --> 17:29.311
Who's that?

17:29.379 --> 17:30.312
Nobody.

17:30.380 --> 17:31.313
I'm nobody?

17:31.381 --> 17:32.514
No, you're Todd.

17:32.582 --> 17:33.916
This is Todd.
I can't talk right now.

17:33.984 --> 17:35.084
Who is that?

17:35.151 --> 17:36.618
Nobody.
I'm nobody?

17:36.686 --> 17:38.554
No.

17:38.621 --> 17:40.255
I can--I can't do this.

17:40.323 --> 17:41.623
I'm gonna have to call you--

17:44.594 --> 17:46.462
External communications

17:46.529 --> 17:50.332
are for Warehouse business
use only.

17:51.601 --> 17:53.435
Maybe a bad idea anyway.

17:55.438 --> 17:57.206
So who's Todd?

17:57.273 --> 17:58.607
A guy.
A friend.

17:58.675 --> 18:00.009
A guy friend.
It's not serious.

18:00.076 --> 18:01.310
Why?

18:01.378 --> 18:02.578
Oh, yeah,
no particular reason.

18:02.645 --> 18:04.113
I just kind of got
the impression that--

18:04.180 --> 18:05.948
yeah, just call her when your
voice has changed, will you?

18:06.016 --> 18:07.649
Work to do.

18:07.717 --> 18:13.155
Hugo One, I think that your
calculations are incorrect.

18:13.223 --> 18:15.090
The agents are not
the problem here.

18:15.158 --> 18:17.393
Falcon Scott protocol
initiated.

18:17.460 --> 18:18.394
No, no, no.
Please.

18:18.461 --> 18:19.762
You can't be serious.

18:19.829 --> 18:22.231
Protecting the Warehouse
is my primary function.

18:22.298 --> 18:25.534
No, no.

18:25.602 --> 18:27.136
What's Falcon Scott protocol?

18:27.203 --> 18:29.238
Well, the system initiates

18:29.305 --> 18:32.307
a temperature drop to sub-zero
to protect the artifacts.

18:32.375 --> 18:37.112
And what happens to us?

18:37.180 --> 18:38.280
Ooh!

18:38.348 --> 18:40.349
Oh, that was fast.

18:40.417 --> 18:42.785
♪ Round and round

18:49.159 --> 18:50.392
It's weird.

18:50.460 --> 18:52.961
There's a recent neuro-imaging
of his brain

18:53.029 --> 18:54.897
and it shows that there's
a whole section

18:54.964 --> 18:56.131
of it that's completely
dormant

18:56.199 --> 18:57.900
and there's no explanation why.

18:57.967 --> 19:00.302
I need to shed a tear.

19:00.370 --> 19:01.804
Don't we all?

19:01.871 --> 19:03.872
I think he means he needs
to go to the bathroom.

19:03.940 --> 19:05.040
What?

19:05.108 --> 19:06.408
Yeah.

19:06.476 --> 19:08.844
My Uncle used to say that.

19:08.912 --> 19:11.180
Hugo, okay,
you hold it, okay?

19:11.247 --> 19:13.248
I just got this baby detailed.

19:13.316 --> 19:15.184
There's a gas station
down the road.

19:15.251 --> 19:17.453
Jeez, it's cold in here.

19:17.520 --> 19:19.054
You think by saying
that every three minutes

19:19.122 --> 19:20.556
it's gonna get any warmer?

19:20.623 --> 19:23.292
Got about an hour left before it
becomes life-threatening.

19:23.359 --> 19:24.493
And where are you taking us?

19:24.561 --> 19:26.395
We got to figure--

19:40.210 --> 19:42.344
I didn't catch that.

19:44.047 --> 19:47.149
What the hell--

20:33.363 --> 20:35.063
You took off his cuffs?

20:35.131 --> 20:37.199
He likes to sit.

20:37.267 --> 20:38.600
That's not in my job
description.

20:38.668 --> 20:40.135
Ice cream.

20:40.203 --> 20:41.436
Not now, Hugo.

20:44.007 --> 20:44.940
That's what it was like
in the bathroom.

20:45.008 --> 20:46.241
Fine.
You know what?

20:46.309 --> 20:47.676
Grab me some twizzlers.

20:47.744 --> 20:50.045
I'm gonna call Artie
and see what's up.

21:03.760 --> 21:07.963
Artie,
I can't understand you.

21:08.031 --> 21:10.365
Albert grows things.

21:10.433 --> 21:11.633
Huh?

21:11.701 --> 21:13.635
Yeah, he's had a long day.

21:13.703 --> 21:18.273
Just keep the change
and thank you.

21:25.081 --> 21:26.748
Okay, Artie, slow down.

21:26.816 --> 21:28.250
Well, there's a new one.

21:28.318 --> 21:29.985
I think the Farnsworth
is broken.

21:30.053 --> 21:31.753
Babble, babble, babble.

21:31.821 --> 21:34.256
Okay, Artie, I don't know
if you can hear me,

21:34.324 --> 21:36.124
but I read through
Hugo's medical file

21:36.192 --> 21:38.160
and half of his brain
is burnt out.

21:46.803 --> 21:50.005
"Bring Hugo back.
Computer has taken over."

21:50.073 --> 21:51.907
What?

22:02.118 --> 22:03.585
Okay, we have
to get back there now.

22:03.620 --> 22:06.121
All right, buddy,
we're going for a ride.

22:06.189 --> 22:08.290
Be on the lookout
for two kidnapping suspects.

22:08.358 --> 22:10.259
If you see either
of these two people,

22:10.326 --> 22:12.227
you are supposed to contact
the police immediately.

22:12.295 --> 22:13.595
Suspects are wanted
in connection--

22:34.851 --> 22:39.655
Gonna have a little chat
with Hugo One.

22:39.722 --> 22:42.557
Lattimer and Bering?

22:42.625 --> 22:43.925
That's what I thought.

22:43.993 --> 22:45.761
Hands above your heads.

22:45.828 --> 22:47.062
Hey, pal,
you're making a mistake.

22:47.130 --> 22:48.930
Don't push me, cowboy!

22:48.998 --> 22:50.999
Or we could just raise up
our hands.

22:51.067 --> 22:52.200
Yeah.

22:52.268 --> 22:53.468
Don't you have any artifacts

22:53.536 --> 22:54.870
that make it warmer?

22:54.937 --> 22:56.705
Increases elasticity,
makes pigeons dance.

22:56.773 --> 22:57.873
Nothing here.

22:57.940 --> 22:58.940
I don't get it.

22:59.008 --> 23:00.275
How is any of this dangerous?

23:00.343 --> 23:01.643
Oh, trust me, if it's been
snagged, bagged,

23:01.711 --> 23:03.812
and tagged,
it's got an evil streak.

23:03.880 --> 23:07.849
So...Todd,
is he your boyfriend?

23:07.917 --> 23:09.918
Guy friend.

23:09.986 --> 23:11.820
Okay, boyfriend.
He's nice.

23:11.888 --> 23:14.256
What about you?

23:14.324 --> 23:15.390
Girlfriend?

23:15.458 --> 23:16.525
Used to.

23:16.592 --> 23:19.795
She, um, doesn't exist anymore.

23:19.862 --> 23:23.198
Oh, when you break up,
you really break up.

23:23.266 --> 23:24.966
I'm new to the whole
dating meme.

23:25.034 --> 23:26.835
I mean, I like Todd,
but he thinks

23:26.903 --> 23:28.470
I work in a tax warehouse,
so it's not like

23:28.538 --> 23:30.672
I can say, "hey, sorry
I can't make our date.

23:30.740 --> 23:34.343
An evil computer took
over my workplace."

23:34.410 --> 23:35.877
Be nice if I could
just have someone

23:35.945 --> 23:40.349
in my life I could
be honest with like you.

23:40.416 --> 23:42.150
Yeah, nice.

23:52.895 --> 23:54.363
Ooh.

23:54.430 --> 23:56.631
Hey, a Zoetrope.

23:56.699 --> 23:58.467
I used to have one of these
when I was a kid.

23:58.534 --> 23:59.768
Yeah, that one
probably makes you--

23:59.836 --> 24:02.671
Fargo, no!

24:19.922 --> 24:21.323
Think I just saw your whole life
flash before my eyes.

24:21.391 --> 24:22.557
And?

24:22.625 --> 24:25.427
Was that a genie costume?

24:25.495 --> 24:29.431
No.

24:29.499 --> 24:31.099
"Max Wertheimer's Zoetrope.

24:31.167 --> 24:33.769
Allows for mind transference."

24:33.836 --> 24:35.203
Get out.

24:35.271 --> 24:36.571
Wertheimer?
Wertheimer.

24:36.639 --> 24:38.106
He was the Gestalt guy
in the '20s.

24:38.174 --> 24:41.643
He pioneered the study of the
brain's thought processes.

24:41.711 --> 24:45.147
I spent some time in a psyche
w--research facility.

24:45.214 --> 24:46.681
Hey, wait a second.

24:46.749 --> 24:48.583
Myka said Hugo kept talking
about spinning and dancing.

24:49.819 --> 24:51.353
Unauthorized removal
of artifact.

24:51.421 --> 24:54.956
Security measures engaged.

24:55.024 --> 24:57.025
Those are my M.A.R.A.S.

24:57.093 --> 24:59.528
Hugo One's been playing
with your toys.

24:59.595 --> 25:01.263
They're just for maintenance
and repair though, right?

25:01.330 --> 25:03.298
Mostly.

25:06.102 --> 25:07.669
Oh!

25:07.737 --> 25:09.805
Whoa.

25:09.872 --> 25:13.308
Nice!

25:13.376 --> 25:15.398
Run!

25:18.435 --> 25:19.378
Don't move.

25:19.653 --> 25:20.686
Cops are on their way.

25:20.754 --> 25:22.722
Okay, look, Leo...

25:22.789 --> 25:24.924
I think you're kind of stepping
in it here, bro.

25:24.991 --> 25:27.660
I mean, the thing is,
we're kind of in a hurry.

25:27.728 --> 25:29.428
Yeah, no kidding,
pretty boy.

25:29.496 --> 25:31.731
I saw you on the APB.

25:31.798 --> 25:33.065
You're wanted for kidnapping.

25:33.133 --> 25:34.333
Probably that guy, right?

25:34.401 --> 25:35.835
The A.I.

25:35.902 --> 25:37.536
It must have accessed the
Internet through the Warehouse.

25:37.604 --> 25:41.073
You think it doesn't want
us to bring Hugo back?

25:41.141 --> 25:44.610
Look, Leo, you're making
a huge mistake,

25:44.678 --> 25:45.878
'cause we're Secret Service.

25:47.614 --> 25:49.115
Look, I'm just gonna reach
for my badge slowly

25:49.182 --> 25:50.049
and I'm gonna
throw it over to you

25:50.117 --> 25:54.220
and just take a look at it.

26:01.428 --> 26:03.162
This looks real.

26:03.230 --> 26:05.164
That's because
it is real, Leo.

26:05.232 --> 26:08.901
But the Secret Service
protects the President.

26:08.969 --> 26:10.970
Yeah, and the President's
nowhere else around here!

26:11.037 --> 26:14.140
Not as stupid
as you thought, huh?

26:14.207 --> 26:15.808
Hey, hey, hey.

26:15.876 --> 26:16.942
What?

26:17.010 --> 26:18.944
Soda pop go "boom."

26:19.012 --> 26:20.246
Pete, are you okay?

26:20.313 --> 26:21.280
What's he talking about?

26:21.348 --> 26:22.681
I don't know.

26:22.749 --> 26:25.384
Blast off with lemon launch.

26:27.788 --> 26:29.155
Remember?

26:29.222 --> 26:30.422
Ahem.
Huh?

26:30.490 --> 26:33.459
Hugo makes his own
lemony launches.

26:33.527 --> 26:34.960
Houston...

26:35.028 --> 26:37.229
We have a problem.

26:37.297 --> 26:39.231
What's wrong with him?

26:39.299 --> 26:40.533
Do not get me started.

26:40.600 --> 26:44.170
Hugo, doesn't Leo
look thirsty?

26:46.173 --> 26:48.974
What a lark!

26:49.042 --> 26:54.246
Look out!

26:54.314 --> 26:56.015
That's it?

26:56.082 --> 26:59.919
What the hell?

26:59.986 --> 27:02.388
Billy Jack!

27:02.455 --> 27:05.191
What did you think
was gonna happen

27:05.258 --> 27:06.625
with the can of soda pop?

27:06.693 --> 27:07.893
What?
The guy built a computer

27:07.961 --> 27:09.428
that can have us arrested.

27:09.496 --> 27:10.996
I thought his practical jokes
would do more

27:11.064 --> 27:12.264
than make the floor sticky.

27:12.332 --> 27:14.867
Ha-ha!
Sticky!

27:22.809 --> 27:24.176
You wanted to chat?

27:24.244 --> 27:26.312
God, I hate that!

27:26.379 --> 27:28.581
I intercepted
Donovan and Fargo

27:28.648 --> 27:31.917
attempting to remove an artifact
from Allentown-22C.

27:31.985 --> 27:34.053
But you didn't
hurt them, right?

27:34.120 --> 27:35.888
The dropping temperatures
will soon preclude

27:35.956 --> 27:37.489
any further breaches
of protocol.

27:37.557 --> 27:38.824
Bully for you.

27:38.892 --> 27:40.092
I'm very happy for you.

27:40.160 --> 27:41.360
Listen, Hugo One,
I was thinking,

27:41.428 --> 27:42.895
you know, while we're
waiting for me

27:42.963 --> 27:45.364
to take the big sleep,
that you and I--

27:45.432 --> 27:47.867
I don't know--we could pass
the time maybe

27:47.934 --> 27:50.569
by playing a game.

27:50.637 --> 27:53.305
Attempting to distract me
with games is futile.

27:53.373 --> 27:54.473
No, I know.
I know.

27:54.541 --> 27:56.609
But come on, Hugo.

27:56.676 --> 27:58.477
Come on.
You can't resist playing a game.

27:58.545 --> 28:01.714
Any game.
I know you can't.

28:01.781 --> 28:02.781
Does that work?

28:02.849 --> 28:04.683
No!

28:13.927 --> 28:15.060
Stupid M.A.R.A.S.

28:15.128 --> 28:16.528
We can't stay in here forever.

28:16.596 --> 28:18.230
We can stay until the--

28:18.298 --> 28:19.932
Until that thing wakes up.
Out, out, out!

28:20.000 --> 28:22.134
We got to get out.

28:22.202 --> 28:23.369
Was that the original--

28:23.436 --> 28:24.737
don't say its name.

28:24.804 --> 28:27.673
Trust me on this.
It can get ugly.

28:34.514 --> 28:35.948
All right, come on.

28:36.016 --> 28:38.117
We're the two biggest techno
brains in the Dakotas

28:38.184 --> 28:39.718
and we're totally getting our
asses kicked by colossus.

28:39.786 --> 28:41.654
That ring you have,
can it amplify

28:41.721 --> 28:42.988
anything other
than human energy?

28:43.056 --> 28:44.256
Like for instance?

28:44.324 --> 28:46.959
For instance...
A laser?

28:47.027 --> 28:48.427
Marry me.

28:48.495 --> 28:51.997
D-9.

28:52.065 --> 28:57.403
No.
Miss.

28:57.470 --> 29:00.372
E-10.

29:00.440 --> 29:01.607
Hit.

29:01.675 --> 29:04.310
Ahh.

29:04.377 --> 29:06.312
You sunk my battleship.

29:06.379 --> 29:07.846
Sorry.

29:07.914 --> 29:09.748
A-7.

29:09.816 --> 29:12.518
Miss again.

29:16.356 --> 29:17.856
If this works,
we'll probably only have

29:17.924 --> 29:20.092
a few seconds before it drains
the cutter's charge.

29:20.160 --> 29:22.294
Hey, if we die,
it's been fun.

29:22.362 --> 29:26.031
Agreed.

29:26.099 --> 29:28.834
Awesome.

29:28.902 --> 29:31.203
Fargo, watch out.

29:31.271 --> 29:33.205
It is my destiny.

29:46.920 --> 29:49.588
20 years of practicing
in front of the mirror

29:49.656 --> 29:51.423
for the best four seconds
of my life!

29:51.491 --> 29:53.459
We rule!

29:57.464 --> 29:59.531
I like Todd.

29:59.599 --> 30:02.401
I had a completely
different thought.

30:02.469 --> 30:04.870
No, I mean--

30:04.938 --> 30:06.372
I'm really sorry.

30:06.439 --> 30:08.173
I like you, Fargo.

30:08.241 --> 30:11.710
I do, but when we kissed,
I was totally thinking of Todd.

30:11.778 --> 30:14.079
I really like him.

30:14.147 --> 30:15.748
He's not just some guy.

30:15.815 --> 30:17.549
He's the guy I think about

30:17.617 --> 30:21.954
when I impulsively kiss guys
I've just met.

30:22.022 --> 30:24.923
We're still cool, right?

30:24.991 --> 30:26.125
Yeah.

30:26.192 --> 30:27.526
Totally.

30:27.594 --> 30:28.861
Okay, good.

30:28.928 --> 30:33.232
Let's find that Zoetrope
and get it to Artie.

30:33.299 --> 30:36.201
This is why Jedi turn
to the dark side.

30:47.113 --> 30:49.415
Come on, Hugo.
Okay.

30:49.482 --> 30:51.350
Artie's here.
Yes, yes.

30:51.418 --> 30:52.618
He is--he is here.

30:52.685 --> 30:53.786
Come on.
Let's go see Artie.

30:53.853 --> 30:57.022
What's wrong?

30:57.090 --> 30:58.023
It won't open.

30:58.091 --> 31:00.025
Tick-tock, change the lock!

31:00.093 --> 31:01.693
Oh, man.

31:01.761 --> 31:03.295
I knew this was gonna
happen some day!

31:03.363 --> 31:05.764
The computers have taken over.

31:05.832 --> 31:07.699
Step one, kill Pete and Myka.

31:07.767 --> 31:10.235
Step two, unleash
the nuclear arsenal

31:10.303 --> 31:11.637
and then, bam!

31:11.704 --> 31:13.605
Pretty soon we're all
in human breeding camps

31:13.673 --> 31:15.207
wearing fur bikinis.

31:15.275 --> 31:17.609
You know, sometimes I think
your brain is the artifact.

31:17.677 --> 31:20.079
It's just a program, Pete.

31:20.146 --> 31:22.714
Computers can't think
for themselves, all right?

31:22.782 --> 31:24.483
Mine does.

31:24.551 --> 31:26.418
Okay.

31:30.390 --> 31:33.158
E-3.

31:33.226 --> 31:34.359
Hit.

31:38.131 --> 31:39.465
You've won,

31:39.532 --> 31:42.734
which is impossible.

31:42.802 --> 31:45.270
Well, not when you've played
the way I have.

31:45.338 --> 31:48.707
See, I never put any
of my battleships

31:48.775 --> 31:52.678
on the board.

31:52.745 --> 31:55.047
You cheated.

31:57.283 --> 31:58.750
You know what I think?

31:58.818 --> 32:00.285
I don't think that you're
artificial intelligence.

32:00.353 --> 32:01.353
You're Hugo Miller.

32:01.421 --> 32:03.055
Part of him, anyway.

32:03.123 --> 32:07.326
Pete and Myka have the other
part, don't they?

32:07.393 --> 32:09.795
You--

32:09.863 --> 32:11.530
you don't know anything
about me.

32:11.598 --> 32:12.965
Well, I think I know
more about you

32:13.032 --> 32:14.199
than you do yourself.

32:14.267 --> 32:15.367
I know that you
loved wearing

32:15.435 --> 32:19.271
those hideous leisure suits.

32:19.339 --> 32:22.608
And I know you had
a fat, orange cat.

32:22.675 --> 32:24.977
And I know that you always
cheated at games.

32:25.044 --> 32:26.912
Used to drive everybody
completely crazy.

32:26.980 --> 32:29.114
And for some reason,
the part of you that loves games

32:29.182 --> 32:34.620
is still in there, and the part
of you that cheated is not.

32:34.687 --> 32:38.157
Hugo, what the hell happened?

32:38.224 --> 32:40.659
Full programming was
discontinued by the Regents.

32:40.727 --> 32:42.027
Deemed too dangerous.

32:42.095 --> 32:44.963
But the potential for
human-computer interface

32:45.031 --> 32:48.033
is invaluable
to the scientific community.

32:48.101 --> 32:49.568
And so you took a shortcut.

32:49.636 --> 32:51.703
You cheated.
You used an artifact.

32:51.771 --> 32:55.140
I may have miscalculated.

32:55.208 --> 32:58.076
Instead of copying my
electro-encephalographic waves,

32:58.144 --> 33:00.312
it transferred them.

33:00.380 --> 33:02.681
Half of Hugo's brain
didn't burn out.

33:02.749 --> 33:06.251
It's in the computers.

33:06.319 --> 33:08.654
Or the left side, anyway.

33:08.721 --> 33:10.556
Compassion and intuition,
improvisation,

33:10.623 --> 33:13.992
that's still in Hugo's body.

33:14.060 --> 33:16.328
Hugo, you can't run the
Warehouse with half a brain.

33:16.396 --> 33:17.696
I mean, look.

33:17.764 --> 33:21.233
I was able to trick you
at a child's board game.

33:21.301 --> 33:25.270
Let Pete and Myka come back
to the Warehouse

33:25.338 --> 33:28.473
with the real Hugo...

33:28.541 --> 33:31.843
And let us try to put your brain
back together.

33:36.282 --> 33:38.150
Oh, man, I'm really starting
to hate these things.

33:38.218 --> 33:39.685
Well, hello.

33:39.752 --> 33:42.287
No, no, Hugo.
No, no, no, no, no, no.

33:43.690 --> 33:44.957
That's a bad sound.

33:45.024 --> 33:46.425
Pete, I really think that
we should just--

33:46.492 --> 33:47.659
I don't know!

33:48.828 --> 33:49.761
Take cover!
Take cover!

33:49.829 --> 33:51.029
Go!
Get down!

33:51.097 --> 33:52.898
Get down! Get down, Hugo!

33:55.605 --> 33:57.072
Artie?
Artie, we got it.

33:57.140 --> 33:58.807
Max Wertheimer's Zoetrope.

33:58.875 --> 34:00.008
Hugo Miller could
have used this

34:00.076 --> 34:02.077
to copy his brain
into Hugo One.

34:02.145 --> 34:03.945
It's why he was able
to create

34:04.013 --> 34:06.248
such a sophisticated
A.I. 25 years ago.

34:06.315 --> 34:08.550
Except that he's not an A.I.
And it's not a copy.

34:08.618 --> 34:11.186
That's really half of Hugo
Miller's brain in there,

34:11.254 --> 34:14.556
which is why he can't function
as a full human being.

34:14.623 --> 34:17.225
Right, Hugo?

34:17.293 --> 34:19.327
Your argument has merit.

34:19.395 --> 34:21.029
The right side
of my brain should be

34:21.097 --> 34:24.099
reconnected with the left,
but not in human form.

34:24.167 --> 34:27.034
Inside the computer.

34:27.103 --> 34:28.904
No.

34:28.971 --> 34:30.138
You'll be trapped in there.

34:30.206 --> 34:32.574
The human body fails
after a few years.

34:32.641 --> 34:34.842
Computers are forever.

34:34.911 --> 34:40.382
He has a point.

34:40.449 --> 34:42.117
If I help you,
then what do I get?

34:42.185 --> 34:43.618
I shall lift
the restrictions

34:43.686 --> 34:45.353
and abort Falcon Scott protocol.

34:45.420 --> 34:47.755
Lattimer and Bering may return
to the Warehouse

34:47.824 --> 34:50.257
with Miller and complete
the transference.

34:50.326 --> 34:51.693
If you do this,
you know you'll be killing

34:51.761 --> 34:52.694
the real Hugo Miller?

34:52.762 --> 34:54.262
No.

34:54.330 --> 34:59.868
The real Hugo Miller will become
his life's work.

34:59.936 --> 35:01.636
All right, okay, Hugo.

35:01.704 --> 35:04.339
That thing's firing freaking
laser beams at us, man!

35:04.407 --> 35:06.341
Pa-cheew!

35:06.409 --> 35:07.709
Ah!

35:09.245 --> 35:11.413
We have to get past that eye.

35:11.480 --> 35:13.081
Where is the Tesla?

35:13.149 --> 35:14.516
Oh, it's in the car.
I'll get it.

35:14.584 --> 35:15.383
Be careful.
Be careful.

35:16.586 --> 35:17.853
Ah!
Okay.

35:17.920 --> 35:19.387
Okay, but it's not
fully charged!

35:19.455 --> 35:20.989
All right, well,
it's our only shot.

35:21.057 --> 35:22.224
Well, I'm a better shot,
so I should take it.

35:22.291 --> 35:23.859
Bull.

35:23.926 --> 35:25.794
Okay.

35:25.862 --> 35:30.031
Ah!

35:30.099 --> 35:34.369
It's gone.

35:34.437 --> 35:38.840
Hugo?

35:38.908 --> 35:40.742
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

35:40.810 --> 35:41.910
Wait, wait, wait.

35:41.978 --> 35:44.145
Hugo, you go first.

35:44.213 --> 35:45.580
Pete!
What?

35:45.648 --> 35:46.581
Just--

35:46.649 --> 35:50.285
all right, I'll go.

35:56.859 --> 35:59.227
Artie, you can't do this.

35:59.295 --> 36:00.428
I know.

36:00.496 --> 36:03.431
It's just Hugo One

36:03.499 --> 36:05.400
has left us no option.

36:05.468 --> 36:06.835
So, what,
this lamp thing

36:06.903 --> 36:08.069
is gonna suck out
the rest

36:08.137 --> 36:09.404
of this poor guy's brain?

36:09.472 --> 36:10.639
Yes.

36:10.706 --> 36:11.973
The Warehouse comes first.

36:12.041 --> 36:14.476
We all knew that going in.

36:14.543 --> 36:18.246
Hello there.

36:18.314 --> 36:21.283
Wait.
That's...

36:21.350 --> 36:22.751
Hugo.

36:22.818 --> 36:23.885
What?

36:23.953 --> 36:24.886
Yeah, I'll explain later.

36:24.954 --> 36:26.354
Shall we begin?

36:26.422 --> 36:27.656
No, no.

36:27.723 --> 36:29.124
Artie, we're not gonna feed
a former Agent

36:29.191 --> 36:30.625
to some pissed off Atari.

36:30.693 --> 36:32.327
No, no, no, Pete!

36:36.332 --> 36:37.966
What the hell
are these things gonna do?

36:38.034 --> 36:39.634
What the hell are
those things gonna do?

36:39.702 --> 36:43.238
Nets, fire, I don't know.

36:43.306 --> 36:44.706
Whoa!

36:47.610 --> 36:49.377
Ah!

36:49.445 --> 36:50.745
Or spinning blades.

36:50.813 --> 36:51.980
No, no, no, no, no.

36:52.048 --> 36:54.549
No, it's okay, guys.
I got it.

36:54.617 --> 36:56.785
Just stay back there
and don't make it angry.

36:56.852 --> 37:00.355
Hugo, that is not necessary.

37:00.423 --> 37:02.657
We will do exactly
as we've agreed.

37:02.725 --> 37:04.559
Thank you.

37:04.627 --> 37:06.094
Until the procedure
is complete,

37:06.162 --> 37:08.063
all systems will remain
on automatic.

37:08.130 --> 37:11.166
You will continue to be locked
out of any access.

37:11.233 --> 37:13.601
Guys, uh,
could you please hurry,

37:13.669 --> 37:15.437
'cause I already shaved
once today?

37:15.504 --> 37:18.173
Please connect the Zoetrope
to the fail-safe.

37:18.240 --> 37:21.076
Claudia.

37:24.013 --> 37:27.882
I'm sorry.

37:27.950 --> 37:29.484
The spinning.

37:29.552 --> 37:32.887
Begin.

37:39.729 --> 37:40.996
Artie, we can't.

37:41.063 --> 37:42.364
You have to stop this.

37:42.431 --> 37:43.498
There's a person in there.

37:43.566 --> 37:45.667
All right, now.

37:45.735 --> 37:46.935
Now what?

37:47.003 --> 37:48.269
Well, the lights are dimmed.
Yeah, and?

37:48.337 --> 37:50.271
That's exactly what happened
when Hugo One--

37:50.339 --> 37:51.806
was first turned on.

37:51.874 --> 37:53.575
So now we've got
a shot because--

37:53.642 --> 37:54.776
because the transfer
might be taking up

37:54.844 --> 37:55.744
most of his processing power.

37:55.811 --> 37:57.045
Yes.

37:57.113 --> 37:57.946
We might be able to get back
into the system.

37:58.014 --> 37:59.547
Exactly.

37:59.615 --> 38:01.149
You can remotely access the
Warehouse through your laptop?

38:01.217 --> 38:02.450
I hacked in from
Switzerland once.

38:02.518 --> 38:04.686
Sweet.

38:04.754 --> 38:06.021
Guys, we're losing him!

38:06.088 --> 38:07.489
There's a pass code.
Crack it!

38:07.556 --> 38:09.157
It's six digits or letters.

38:09.225 --> 38:10.392
I'm counting on your hackery.

38:10.459 --> 38:11.659
I need more than eight
seconds.

38:11.727 --> 38:13.028
Ah!

38:13.095 --> 38:14.729
Myka, the picture!

38:14.797 --> 38:17.198
He gave us this code
when we visited him.

38:17.266 --> 38:18.933
He drew a picture of a cat.

38:19.001 --> 38:20.602
Ooh, he had a fat, orange cat.

38:20.669 --> 38:22.437
What was the name of the cat?
Fatty, catty, orangey.

38:22.505 --> 38:23.338
Orangey!
Try orangey!

38:23.406 --> 38:25.273
No go.

38:25.341 --> 38:26.341
"Orangey"?
Really?

38:26.409 --> 38:27.776
Albert!

38:27.843 --> 38:28.877
Albert!
It's Albert!

38:28.944 --> 38:30.078
How do you know that?

38:30.146 --> 38:31.212
'Cause we went
in that store

38:31.280 --> 38:32.647
and Hugo said,
"Albert grows things."

38:32.715 --> 38:33.915
Name of his cat is Albert.

38:33.983 --> 38:35.316
I'm in.
Yes!

38:35.384 --> 38:39.754
All right, lock him out
of everything but this lab.

38:39.822 --> 38:41.956
Illegal access.
Disengage.

38:42.024 --> 38:45.994
Oh, boo-hoo.

38:46.062 --> 38:47.796
Time to set things right.

39:35.152 --> 39:37.687
What are you all doing
in my office?

39:37.755 --> 39:40.289
Hugo...

39:40.357 --> 39:42.492
You don't remember?

39:42.559 --> 39:44.694
Remember what?

39:44.762 --> 39:47.897
I was in the middle
of a procedure and I--

39:47.965 --> 39:51.300
oh.

39:51.368 --> 39:52.669
Oh, wha--

39:52.736 --> 39:54.704
what the hell is this?

39:54.772 --> 39:56.806
What?

39:56.874 --> 39:58.241
Wha--

39:58.308 --> 40:01.377
Hugo, buddy, we got
a little story to tell you.

40:01.445 --> 40:03.379
Let's go get some ice cream.

40:03.447 --> 40:04.914
I can't.

40:04.982 --> 40:05.982
I'm lactose intolerant.

40:06.050 --> 40:07.083
Ooh.

40:07.151 --> 40:08.418
What?

40:15.726 --> 40:18.394
Do you ever think
about our future here?

40:18.462 --> 40:21.631
Like, how do we not end up
with our brains scrambled

40:21.699 --> 40:25.468
or blown up or whatever new
way to die there could be?

40:25.536 --> 40:27.870
Well, I mean,
look at the bright side.

40:27.938 --> 40:29.672
I'm usually within
ten feet of you,

40:29.740 --> 40:31.674
so whatever terrible thing
happens to you

40:31.742 --> 40:33.242
will probably happen to me too.

40:33.310 --> 40:37.847
Comforting.

40:37.915 --> 40:41.818
You know, when we play
rock, paper, scissors,

40:41.885 --> 40:43.686
you don't always have
to pick rock.

40:43.754 --> 40:45.154
I don't always pick rock.

40:45.222 --> 40:46.556
Yes, you do.

40:46.623 --> 40:50.226
All right, next time
I will pick scissors.

40:50.294 --> 40:54.430
See, you shouldn't have
told me that.

40:54.498 --> 40:55.765
And that should do it.

40:55.833 --> 40:57.333
All the most recent patches
and upgrades.

40:57.401 --> 40:59.435
Ah, I cannot wait
to see all the technical

40:59.503 --> 41:01.370
achievements I've missed.

41:01.438 --> 41:04.407
Did Billy Gates ever get that
project of his off the ground?

41:04.475 --> 41:06.576
Um, in a way.

41:06.643 --> 41:08.077
You will love Eureka.

41:08.145 --> 41:09.912
We have a brain-mapping project
so up your alley,

41:09.980 --> 41:11.214
it has a parking space.

41:11.281 --> 41:13.549
Yeah, if things
don't work out

41:13.617 --> 41:15.351
in Eureka, please consider
coming back

41:15.419 --> 41:16.853
to be with us.

41:16.920 --> 41:18.488
Oh, thanks, but I really
couldn't leave Eureka.

41:18.555 --> 41:20.356
Not you.

41:20.424 --> 41:21.858
I'm so glad you're back.

41:21.925 --> 41:23.326
Thank you, Agent Nielsen.

41:23.393 --> 41:24.827
Oh, just call me Artie.
Artie.

41:24.895 --> 41:25.762
Artie?
Yeah.

41:25.829 --> 41:27.096
Wait.

41:27.164 --> 41:28.464
Artie!
Yeah.

41:28.532 --> 41:29.832
We used to play battleship
together.

41:29.900 --> 41:31.134
Yes.

41:31.201 --> 41:32.568
You hated computers.

41:32.636 --> 41:35.438
Yeah, and still do.

41:35.506 --> 41:36.906
Maybe there is no such
thing as evolution.

41:39.209 --> 41:42.145
You and me and MacPherson,
we have to get together.

41:42.212 --> 41:44.747
Well, that would be nice,

41:44.815 --> 41:47.283
but there aren't as many
of us from the old days

41:47.351 --> 41:48.284
as there used to be.

41:48.352 --> 41:51.254
Ahh.

41:51.321 --> 41:52.588
Hugo.

41:52.656 --> 41:54.390
Artie.

41:54.458 --> 41:57.827
Good luck.

41:57.895 --> 41:59.729
I got it.

42:07.271 --> 42:09.305
Hey.
Hey.

42:09.373 --> 42:10.640
Thank you for coming.
I'm sorry.

42:10.707 --> 42:12.008
I'm so sorry we got cut off
earlier.

42:12.075 --> 42:13.676
Something huge came up and I--

42:13.744 --> 42:15.144
it's okay.

42:15.212 --> 42:17.780
Um, listen, there's something
I need to tell you.

42:17.848 --> 42:19.282
Me too.

42:19.349 --> 42:22.652
Um, look, I'm sorry
I've been such a flake lately.

42:22.719 --> 42:26.088
My head's been
in a weird place,

42:26.156 --> 42:28.191
but I recently
got some clarity.

42:28.258 --> 42:30.793
I don't think it's a good idea
for me to see you anymore.

42:34.364 --> 42:37.567
I'm sorry.
