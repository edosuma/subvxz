Can you follow my finger?

00:10.399 --> 00:12.234
I'd have to give that a 4.

00:12.301 --> 00:15.637
Hmm. Definitely a 4.

00:15.704 --> 00:17.371
All right, squeeze my hand.

00:21.744 --> 00:26.280
Okay, that looks like a 6 to
me, for a total G.C.S. of 15.

00:26.348 --> 00:27.682
That is a perfect score.

00:27.750 --> 00:29.683
Charlie, you're officially out of a coma.

00:29.751 --> 00:31.518
Shahir, I've got this.

00:31.585 --> 00:33.120
Actually, there are a few
more neurological tests...

00:33.187 --> 00:35.022
Shahir, she's got this.

Yeah, absolutely. Could I
talk to you for a second?

02:06.842 --> 02:08.175
Yeah. I'm good.

02:15.150 --> 02:16.416
What's up?

02:19.354 --> 02:21.055
I'm leaving the hospital.

02:21.123 --> 02:22.256
- Were you fired?
- I quit.

02:22.323 --> 02:24.291
That's too bad.

02:26.294 --> 02:29.563
Yeah, you know, it's just time to move on.

02:29.631 --> 02:31.097
I'm actually pretty excited about it.

02:31.165 --> 02:33.567
I'm going to follow up with
a few of my patients today,

02:33.635 --> 02:35.269
and that's it. I'm gone.

02:35.336 --> 02:37.770
Well, everything I could have

Charlie, the physiotherapist will help

02:51.451 --> 02:52.618
with any muscle weakness,

02:52.686 --> 02:55.754
and the occupational therapy will deal

02:55.821 --> 02:57.589
- with any cognitive deficits.
- Brain damage.

02:57.657 --> 02:59.023
Right.

02:59.091 --> 03:01.959
(Clears throat) Shahir, do your patients

03:02.027 --> 03:05.963
usually, um... remember being in a coma?

03:06.031 --> 03:07.865
Some do.

03:07.933 --> 03:12.903
Yeah. See, I had very vivid
hallucinations that I was, um...

03:15.373 --> 03:17.073
out of my body.

03:17.141 --> 03:20.210
Were these hallucinations
visual or auditory?

03:20.278 --> 03:22.746
Both. I would say both. Definitely both.

03:22.814 --> 03:23.947
In a coma, a person basically loses contact

03:24.015 --> 03:26.182
with their body sensory input,

03:26.249 --> 03:28.685
so they feel sensations
as though they're external

03:28.752 --> 03:30.820
to their bodies, but they keep the illusion

03:30.887 --> 03:32.221
that they have a body.

03:32.289 --> 03:35.425
It's very similar to the
early stages of sleep.

03:35.492 --> 03:36.759
So I was dreaming?

03:36.827 --> 03:39.061
Yes, and because you didn't wake up,

03:39.129 --> 03:40.095
your dreams became a
reality. (Elevator bell dings)

03:40.163 --> 03:42.263
- It's really quite common.
- Ha!

03:42.332 --> 03:45.266
Do you believe what you
experienced was real?

03:45.335 --> 03:48.503
No, of course not.

03:48.571 --> 03:51.473
Charlie, you're perfectly normal, okay?

03:51.541 --> 03:53.475
Okay. Don't sweat it.

03:53.543 --> 03:54.743
I'm gonna find you a therapist.

03:54.811 --> 03:58.045
Okay. I'll, uh, I'll just wait here.

03:58.112 --> 04:00.781
I'm perfectly normal.

04:03.151 --> 04:04.719
Still talking to myself...

04:04.786 --> 04:09.657
but now everyone can hear me.

04:09.725 --> 04:11.258
Hi.

04:13.294 --> 04:15.962
How you doing?

04:20.053 --> 04:21.053
You put this in yourself?

04:21.120 --> 04:23.455
- No, a doctor did it for me.
- Were you in another E.R.

04:23.523 --> 04:24.856
before you came here?

04:24.924 --> 04:26.424
No, I paid a doctor $1,500

04:26.491 --> 04:28.059
to put a nasogastric tube in for me.

04:28.126 --> 04:29.827
We'd do it for free.

04:30.796 --> 04:32.263
Just saying.

04:32.330 --> 04:35.098
- And why did you do this?
- I'm trying to lose weight.

04:35.166 --> 04:37.200
By eating through a tube?

04:37.268 --> 04:38.569
Jackie, you're not overweight.

04:38.636 --> 04:41.471
For a bride, I am. Ow!
That really hurts.

04:41.539 --> 04:42.839
I'm trying to lose weight for my wedding.

04:42.907 --> 04:45.042
I get 800 calories a day
pushed through this tube.

04:45.109 --> 04:46.577
And how long have you had it in?

04:46.644 --> 04:49.344
10 days. I've lost 12 pounds,
so it's a success, but...

04:49.412 --> 04:51.047
ow!

04:51.114 --> 04:52.615
You're not gonna take it out, are you?

04:52.683 --> 04:53.716
- Did you get her into an X-ray?
- Yeah.

04:53.784 --> 04:56.118
Check this out.

04:56.186 --> 04:58.387
She has free air under her diaphragm.

04:58.455 --> 05:01.156
- Is that bad?
- It's kind of an emergency, yeah.

05:01.224 --> 05:02.892
He's right. Given the pain you're in

05:02.960 --> 05:04.126
and the tenderness in your belly,

05:04.194 --> 05:05.426
I think it's possible that the tube

05:05.494 --> 05:06.861
has perforated your stomach.

05:06.929 --> 05:09.564
Ohh. My fiancé's not gonna believe this.

05:09.632 --> 05:11.566
He's just gonna be happy
you're alive, trust me. Olivia?

05:11.634 --> 05:12.901
He thinks it's ridiculous,

05:12.969 --> 05:14.035
but it's important for a woman to look good

05:14.103 --> 05:15.236
on her wedding day, right?

05:15.304 --> 05:17.672
- It is, but...
- All those pictures.

05:17.740 --> 05:20.108
I just wanted him to see
me and be proud, you know?

05:20.175 --> 05:21.409
Well, it's important that
you give him a call, okay?

05:21.477 --> 05:22.810
We're gonna get you
into surgery right away,

05:22.877 --> 05:24.778
and Olivia will prep you.

05:24.846 --> 05:26.080
Okay.

05:26.148 --> 05:27.047
We should find out who put that tube in.

05:27.116 --> 05:28.983
It's unbelievable.

05:29.050 --> 05:31.185
Hey. Charlie.

05:31.253 --> 05:32.487
Yeah.

05:32.554 --> 05:34.622
Oh, my God.

05:34.689 --> 05:36.790
- You are such a tiger.
- Mmm.

05:36.858 --> 05:39.493
You're like a dirty nerd.

05:39.560 --> 05:41.161
If I'd known you were so dirty,

05:41.229 --> 05:42.262
I wouldn't have waited this long.

05:42.330 --> 05:45.031
(Chuckles) Maggie.

05:45.099 --> 05:47.434
We don't have to be so... full-on.

05:47.502 --> 05:49.702
You don't want me to kiss you at work.

05:49.770 --> 05:52.405
No, no. I... I want you
to kiss me everywhere.

05:52.473 --> 05:54.906
I...

05:54.974 --> 05:57.610
you don't have to try so hard with me.

05:57.677 --> 05:59.278
That's all I'm saying.

06:01.047 --> 06:02.748
Um...

06:05.519 --> 06:06.785
Okay.

06:09.088 --> 06:11.656
I've been on every diet...

06:11.723 --> 06:14.159
the watermelon diet, the grapefruit diet,

06:14.226 --> 06:17.295
the lemonade diet, seafood diet.

06:17.363 --> 06:18.429
<i>You see food, you eat it?</i>

06:18.497 --> 06:20.298
Yeah. I'm still on that one.

06:20.366 --> 06:22.400
- It's easier for men.
- No, I'm just saying,

06:22.468 --> 06:23.734
it's your wedding. You don't
want there to be too much...

06:23.802 --> 06:25.435
sausage in the casing.

06:25.503 --> 06:29.306
(Monitors beep) I'm running
the stomach on the greater curve

06:29.374 --> 06:32.309
from the pylorus right to the body.

06:32.377 --> 06:33.910
Okay, I see the perforation.

06:33.978 --> 06:35.845
There's some gastric content.

06:35.913 --> 06:39.149
Damn it. There are nodules in the omentum.

06:39.217 --> 06:40.551
Oh, no.

06:40.618 --> 06:42.251
Okay, we're gonna need
to get a quick biopsy

06:42.319 --> 06:44.587
and a quick section. Cautery, please.

06:44.655 --> 06:46.088
Yeah.

06:46.156 --> 06:47.490
To the left.

06:47.558 --> 06:49.659
When I push on the antrum, it's rigid.

06:49.726 --> 06:53.028
I shouldn't have made fun of her.

06:53.096 --> 06:55.531
We don't know what it is.
Let's try to stay positive.

06:55.599 --> 06:57.799
As soon as I've finished this,
let's take the scopes out.

06:57.866 --> 06:58.933
We gotta open her up.

06:59.001 --> 07:00.535
Damn it.

07:00.603 --> 07:02.704
(Grunting) Okay.

07:02.771 --> 07:04.606
Okay. Okay. Ow.

07:04.674 --> 07:06.541
Cops brought him in. Heroin user.

07:06.609 --> 07:08.042
O.D.'d under a bridge.

07:08.110 --> 07:09.744
Medics gave him naloxone.

07:09.812 --> 07:11.546
He got all jacked up and tried
to punch someone in the face.

07:11.614 --> 07:13.814
I was confused.

07:13.881 --> 07:17.784
- How much did you take?
- (Chuckles) A lot, I guess, 'cause I'm here.

07:17.852 --> 07:20.321
He's tachycardic, febrile, and temp's 103.

07:20.388 --> 07:21.622
You went through his pockets.

07:21.690 --> 07:23.457
Yep. Found a copy of "The Flowers of Evil."

07:23.525 --> 07:25.826
Wallet, no cash, no drugs.
Name's Wesley Taylor.

07:25.893 --> 07:27.494
It's Wes.

07:27.562 --> 07:29.995
And hello, you can't strap
me down. I didn't do anything.

07:30.063 --> 07:32.164
Well, we'd love to let you
leave, Wes, but you're sick.

07:32.233 --> 07:34.434
I feel okay, honestly.

07:34.501 --> 07:37.737
This whole thing is just crossed wires.

07:37.804 --> 07:39.305
I just want you to unstrap me.

07:39.373 --> 07:40.540
Because you wanna go score,

07:40.608 --> 07:42.041
and we can't let you do that right now.

07:42.109 --> 07:44.711
Look, I need to go because
my friend owes me $50, okay?

07:44.778 --> 07:47.579
And I can't call him
because I lost my phone.

07:47.647 --> 07:50.882
Sir, he's waiting for
me. Okay, I can go, right?

07:50.950 --> 07:52.251
- No.
- Come on. Let me go.

07:52.318 --> 07:54.119
- Wes.
- I gotta go. Let me go.

07:54.186 --> 07:56.755
- Let me go!
- Lay back down, Flowers of Evil.
You're not going anywhere.

07:56.822 --> 07:58.624
(Lowered voice) Hey. Lady doctor.

07:58.691 --> 07:59.858
Please help me.

07:59.925 --> 08:01.925
His track marks look infected.

08:01.993 --> 08:03.827
Yeah. Looks like cellulitis.

08:03.895 --> 08:06.731
All right, Olivia, let's
get 2 grams of cefazolin.

08:06.798 --> 08:09.800
- I'm on it.
- And do you have a skin marker? Great.

08:09.868 --> 08:17.074
Okay. And, uh, let's do an
aerobic and anaerobic swab

08:17.142 --> 08:19.208
and blood culture, make sure
there's no strep in there.

08:19.277 --> 08:21.578
Wes, we're gonna come
back and check on you soon.

08:21.646 --> 08:24.281
If you're not calm, these don't come off.

08:27.117 --> 08:29.152
Hey. So I hear that Goran is leaving.

08:29.219 --> 08:30.487
Uh-huh.

08:30.554 --> 08:32.455
You know, I'm getting a divorce.

08:32.523 --> 08:35.256
Technically, I'm basically single myself.

08:35.325 --> 08:37.626
Yeah. I'm seeing somebody.

08:37.693 --> 08:38.794
I... didn't mean it like that.

08:38.861 --> 08:40.227
I was just throwing it out there

08:40.297 --> 08:41.929
just to see if, you know,
anything came back to me.

08:41.998 --> 08:46.034
<i>Dude, you are very, very rusty.</i>

08:46.102 --> 08:49.104
Okay, the liver looks okay.

08:49.172 --> 08:51.639
I see some bile-stained fluid
in the peritoneal cavity.

08:51.707 --> 08:56.277
I'm feeling the mass in
the antrum. That's bad.

08:56.345 --> 08:57.878
What the hell is a 38-year-old woman

08:57.946 --> 09:00.715
doing with gastric cancer?

09:00.783 --> 09:02.583
Okay, the tube must have perforated

09:02.651 --> 09:04.519
just proximal to the tumor. Suction?

09:04.586 --> 09:08.722
Oh, boy, she's got more
nodules in the peritoneum. Metz.

09:08.790 --> 09:11.891
(Suction gurgling)

09:15.330 --> 09:16.430
(Phone buzzes)

09:16.497 --> 09:18.598
I'm gonna take the tumor out.

09:18.666 --> 09:20.834
Path results?

09:20.901 --> 09:23.001
Yeah, that's why they
call it a quick section.

09:23.069 --> 09:27.105
(Sighs) Hey, Dr. Reid here.

09:27.173 --> 09:29.809
Okay.

09:29.876 --> 09:32.277
Thanks.

09:32.346 --> 09:34.680
Jackie's cancer has metastasized.

09:34.748 --> 09:36.081
What do you wanna do?

09:36.149 --> 09:37.816
<i>Well, there's not a lot we can do,</i>

09:37.883 --> 09:39.451
but we can take out the primary tumor.

09:39.518 --> 09:41.619
We're gonna do a B2 reconstruction.

09:41.687 --> 09:44.489
I will need a G.I.A.
60 with a green firing.

09:44.557 --> 09:46.424
She may not have much longer,

09:46.492 --> 09:49.861
but... we can try and
make her more comfortable.

09:52.197 --> 09:53.530
Okay, just wait.

09:53.598 --> 09:55.566
Let me get in here.

09:55.633 --> 09:56.933
Okay. I got you. You got the bars?

09:57.001 --> 09:59.169
- Yep.
- (Strained voice) Okay, let's go up.

09:59.237 --> 10:00.203
That's it. Use your upper body strength

10:00.271 --> 10:01.238
to support your weight.

10:01.305 --> 10:02.873
- You steady?
- Yep.

10:02.940 --> 10:05.275
Okay, now I want you to
take a small step forward.

10:05.343 --> 10:07.745
(Grunts) That's it.

10:07.812 --> 10:10.012
Good. Good.

10:10.080 --> 10:11.581
- Okay. Now let's do another one.
- No, I got it.

10:11.648 --> 10:13.015
I got it. You can let go.

10:13.083 --> 10:14.717
No, I'm not gonna let go. Just take...

10:14.785 --> 10:15.852
Gino!

10:15.919 --> 10:17.587
Let go.

10:17.654 --> 10:20.857
Okay. Okay, big guy. Go ahead.

10:20.924 --> 10:23.125
Just take it easy, okay?

10:26.128 --> 10:27.195
(Exhales deeply)

10:27.263 --> 10:29.564
That's it. That's it.

10:29.632 --> 10:31.232
(Grunts)

10:33.335 --> 10:34.936
(Exhales sharply)

10:37.840 --> 10:39.340
(Exhales sharply)

10:40.576 --> 10:43.143
That was really good.
It was. It was excellent.

10:43.211 --> 10:44.945
- (Sighs) Thank you.
- Okay, come on, cowboy.

10:45.013 --> 10:46.414
Let's get back on the horse, huh?

10:46.481 --> 10:48.582
- Come on.
- Just let... let me do it.

10:48.650 --> 10:51.985
Okay. Fine.

10:55.156 --> 10:59.091
(Grunting)

11:00.961 --> 11:02.161
You sure you got this?

11:03.831 --> 11:07.734
(Grunting)

11:07.802 --> 11:10.069
That's good. You're almost there.

11:10.137 --> 11:11.137
You're almost there.

11:11.204 --> 11:13.906
(Grunting)

11:13.973 --> 11:15.340
There.

11:15.408 --> 11:17.876
Yeah, that was great.

11:17.944 --> 11:19.745
(Panting)

11:19.813 --> 11:22.881
Just... we'll keep doing
this till I get it right.

11:22.949 --> 11:26.752
Yeah, or we could just do it
and leave it at that, okay?

11:26.820 --> 11:28.620
Look, man, this is gonna be hard, okay?

11:28.688 --> 11:30.621
And you're gonna get frustrated.

11:30.689 --> 11:32.022
(Sighs) I'm just used
to being good at things.

11:32.090 --> 11:34.325
Yeah, well, get un-used to that, all right?

11:34.392 --> 11:36.360
Get used to being a guy
that just woke up from a coma

11:36.428 --> 11:37.929
and let me help you,

11:37.996 --> 11:40.998
and maybe you can go back
to being that other guy.

11:46.270 --> 11:47.437
Charlie!

11:47.505 --> 11:50.941
Charlie. Charlie.

11:51.008 --> 11:52.241
Hey! There you are.

11:52.309 --> 11:54.544
We having lunch today like regular people?

11:54.612 --> 11:57.080
What? Why weren't you at physio?

11:57.147 --> 11:59.182
Uh... I'm on a break.

11:59.249 --> 12:02.718
They let us out to eat and drink.

12:02.786 --> 12:04.820
- What's wrong?
- I just wish you would have texted me.

12:04.888 --> 12:06.355
To tell you that I'm gonna
have a bottle of water

12:06.422 --> 12:08.056
- and read the paper?
- To let me know where you were.

12:08.124 --> 12:09.925
Why?

12:09.993 --> 12:12.595
You just got out of a coma.

12:12.662 --> 12:14.763
And so what, therefore...

12:14.831 --> 12:16.532
So you can't go wandering around.

12:16.600 --> 12:18.533
Baby, I'm in the hospital.

12:18.601 --> 12:19.834
If I'm gonna wander around anywhere,

12:19.902 --> 12:21.035
this is the place to do it.

12:21.103 --> 12:22.269
If anything were to happen to me...

12:22.337 --> 12:23.571
if something were to happen to you,

12:23.639 --> 12:25.072
I would need to be
there... me, who was there

12:25.140 --> 12:26.407
for the last three months,
who watched you code twice,

12:26.475 --> 12:27.475
who watched them take
you off the ventilator,

12:27.543 --> 12:29.210
to watch Shahir put electrodes

12:29.277 --> 12:31.145
in your head, Charlie. That was me.

12:31.213 --> 12:33.680
I was there, and I need
to know where you are.

12:33.748 --> 12:35.749
Come with me.

12:43.190 --> 12:45.025
Sit.

12:45.092 --> 12:47.594
I have been away.

12:47.662 --> 12:49.762
Yep, and I've been here.

12:49.830 --> 12:51.697
I know. Now what are you angry about?

12:51.765 --> 12:53.198
What are you... what are you pissed about?

12:53.266 --> 12:56.468
I'm not pissed. I'm... I'm worried.

12:56.537 --> 12:58.037
I just want you to be safe.

12:58.104 --> 13:00.506
I'm in a wheelchair. It doesn't
get much safer than this.

13:00.574 --> 13:03.308
How can I help? How can
I... how can I reassure you?

13:03.376 --> 13:07.045
I don't know.

13:07.112 --> 13:09.280
(Sighs) There's nothing you can do.

13:09.348 --> 13:12.283
Look, I know this is a
big adjustment for you.

13:12.351 --> 13:16.555
Trust me, I promise you, it
is a bigger adjustment for me.

13:16.622 --> 13:19.390
You don't know what it was like.

13:19.458 --> 13:22.793
Alex...

13:22.861 --> 13:24.528
I'm not going anywhere.

13:24.596 --> 13:27.631
You don't know that.

13:29.901 --> 13:33.403
Well, you're right. (Scoffs)

13:33.471 --> 13:34.905
But I don't want to.

13:36.000 --> 13:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

13:45.449 --> 13:46.849
Alex...

13:48.485 --> 13:51.988
I am sorry that I left you.

13:59.729 --> 14:01.029
(Lowered voice) Come here.

14:01.097 --> 14:02.598
I didn't... uh, are you okay?

14:02.665 --> 14:04.066
I'm okay.

14:04.133 --> 14:05.266
I don't wanna hurt you.

14:05.334 --> 14:07.769
You won't hurt me. Come here.

14:07.837 --> 14:08.904
I just want you closer.

14:08.972 --> 14:11.772
(Sighs)

14:13.775 --> 14:15.743
I didn't break.

14:23.184 --> 14:24.719
You are such a commitment-phobe.

14:24.786 --> 14:25.986
Well, people change jobs all the time.

14:26.053 --> 14:28.588
Well, you're gonna be lost without us.

14:28.656 --> 14:29.823
You know, it's interesting.

14:29.890 --> 14:31.424
You seem genuinely concerned about me.

14:31.492 --> 14:34.627
I am genuinely concerned
about you as your friend.

14:34.694 --> 14:36.496
What are you gonna do with yourself?

14:36.563 --> 14:37.863
I don't know. I was thinking about Haiti.

14:37.931 --> 14:40.366
- Oh, you have no idea, do you?
- Not really.

14:40.434 --> 14:41.634
The infection's spreading,

14:41.701 --> 14:42.602
if you take a look at the margins here.

14:42.669 --> 14:44.837
I need something for my pain.

14:44.904 --> 14:46.038
Hi, Wes. I'm Dr. Goran.

14:46.106 --> 14:47.773
(Grunts) Feel that? Take a listen.

14:47.841 --> 14:50.842
(Inhales sharply) Ow! It hurts.
Please, I'm not making this up.

14:50.909 --> 14:53.478
It's a crackly, popping sound.

14:53.546 --> 14:55.180
It's crepitus.

14:55.248 --> 14:56.515
It's gas under the skin caused by bacteria.

14:56.582 --> 14:58.350
- Well, let's give him 10 milligrams of morphine.
- Make it 30.

14:58.417 --> 14:59.618
You do a swab?

14:59.685 --> 15:01.386
Yeah, results aren't back yet.

15:01.454 --> 15:03.588
- I'm confident diagnosing him, though.
- Yeah, I agree with you.

15:03.656 --> 15:06.223
- Ohh, what is going on?
- Wes, I think you have necrotizing fasciitis.

15:06.291 --> 15:08.692
It's extremely serious. We
need to get you into an O.R.

15:08.760 --> 15:10.361
And try and stop the
infection from spreading.

15:10.428 --> 15:12.296
Wait. That... that's
flesh-eating disease, right?

15:12.364 --> 15:14.064
We need to get him into the O.R. right now.

15:15.433 --> 15:18.402
Olivia, 4.5 grams pip-tazo. Call ahead.

15:18.470 --> 15:21.204
We got an "A" case here. I
need Dr. Ray and a scrub nurse.

15:21.272 --> 15:24.474
- What are you gonna do to me?
- He's gonna try to save your life.

15:24.542 --> 15:25.908
All right, we're gonna cut the arm,

15:25.976 --> 15:27.544
see if the tissue's still good.

15:27.611 --> 15:29.779
We're gonna irrigate the wound,
try and flush the bacteria out.

15:29.846 --> 15:32.515
- Wait. You have to cut my arm?
- If the infection's spreading like I think it has,

15:32.583 --> 15:34.750
- Wes, you might be facing amputation.
- The infection moves incredibly fast, Wes.

15:34.818 --> 15:36.052
She's right. And once
you're under anesthetic,

15:36.119 --> 15:37.553
we're not gonna be able to wake you up

15:37.620 --> 15:39.588
- and ask you any questions.
- I don't wanna lose my arm.

15:39.656 --> 15:41.456
If it comes down to that, it
could be your arm or your life.

15:41.524 --> 15:43.659
- Can we call your family or anything for you?
- No.

15:43.726 --> 15:45.026
Okay, can you prep this for me, Victor?

15:45.094 --> 15:46.562
I can prep him, but I'm in another surgery.

15:46.629 --> 15:48.763
- Lindsay can assist.
- Okay, get her in here now.

15:48.831 --> 15:50.031
(Victor) Okay.

15:50.099 --> 15:51.233
He's strapped in. You ready for this?

15:51.301 --> 15:52.467
Miss you already, Joel.

15:52.535 --> 15:55.069
(Chuckles)

16:00.089 --> 16:03.325
Happy to hear that Charlie's doing well.

16:03.393 --> 16:05.061
Alex?

16:05.128 --> 16:08.330
I said I'm happy to hear
that Charlie's doing well.

16:08.398 --> 16:13.034
Yeah. He's back to his old self.

16:13.102 --> 16:16.504
Have you thought about doing
therapy as part of his recovery?

16:16.572 --> 16:19.407
You wanna shrink Charlie Harris?

16:19.474 --> 16:20.942
A lot of patients that
come back from a T.B.I.

16:21.010 --> 16:25.012
can experience frustration
and anger, mood swings.

16:25.080 --> 16:26.446
Not that I've seen.

16:26.514 --> 16:29.817
- He's really fine. Yeah.
- It's the early days.

16:29.884 --> 16:31.985
(Elevator bell dings, doors open)

16:33.755 --> 16:35.823
So can I make him an appointment?

16:35.890 --> 16:38.425
He's awake. You can ask him yourself.

16:38.492 --> 16:40.694
I'm more intimidated
by him than I am by you.

16:40.761 --> 16:43.295
And you should be, so just why
don't you dust off your couch

16:43.363 --> 16:44.831
when there's actually a problem?

16:47.801 --> 16:49.268
(Knocks)

16:49.336 --> 16:50.737
Hey, Dr. Reid.

16:50.804 --> 16:51.771
Hi, Jackie.

16:51.839 --> 16:53.439
This is my husband-to-be Mark.

16:53.506 --> 16:55.074
- Nice to meet you.
- Kids, say hi.

16:55.142 --> 16:57.109
Jakey and Anna... well, technically

16:57.176 --> 16:58.877
Jake is Mark, and Anna's mine.

16:58.945 --> 17:00.078
Why don't you tell the nice doctor

17:00.146 --> 17:01.646
what you wanna wear to the wedding?

17:01.714 --> 17:02.814
A bunny costume.

17:02.882 --> 17:04.782
A bunny costume.

17:04.851 --> 17:06.684
I think we should just let her have

17:06.752 --> 17:08.653
- a whole bunny-themed wedding.
- I think that's an awesome idea.

17:08.721 --> 17:10.655
We need some awesome ideas.
I try to lose some weight,

17:10.723 --> 17:12.190
and I wind up under the knife.

17:12.258 --> 17:13.423
Yeah, I didn't wanna say anything, honey,

17:13.491 --> 17:15.392
but you're looking kinda fatter.

17:15.460 --> 17:17.627
I don't think I can go
through with the wedding.

17:17.694 --> 17:19.296
He wasn't even mad about the money.

17:19.364 --> 17:20.897
What a guy. Did I get lucky or what?

17:20.965 --> 17:22.499
How does it look?

17:22.567 --> 17:23.733
Just fine.

17:23.801 --> 17:25.669
What happened to non-invasive?

17:25.737 --> 17:27.271
Is there a problem?

17:27.338 --> 17:29.639
Actually, Jackie, we had to
remove part of your stomach.

17:29.706 --> 17:30.740
<i>Why?</i>

17:30.808 --> 17:32.809
- Because of the N.G. tube?
- No.

17:32.877 --> 17:34.644
We don't know what the exact cause is,

17:34.711 --> 17:37.346
but we're waiting for the
test results to be sure.

17:37.414 --> 17:39.515
Anyway, you're with your family.

17:39.583 --> 17:41.017
I'll come back.

17:41.085 --> 17:42.786
It's okay.

17:42.853 --> 17:43.820
It's okay.

17:43.888 --> 17:44.953
Sens, please.

17:45.021 --> 17:46.889
Place your retractors in here.

17:46.956 --> 17:48.523
What are you gonna do?

17:48.591 --> 17:51.559
I am going to zap the tissue
and see if the muscle contracts.

17:51.627 --> 17:52.560
We're looking for the four c's in here.

17:52.628 --> 17:53.896
What are we looking for?

17:53.963 --> 17:55.397
Contractility, capacity to bleed,

17:55.464 --> 17:56.965
consistency, and color.

17:57.033 --> 17:58.801
I'll tell you right now
that color is not good.

17:58.868 --> 18:01.135
It's not contracting, either.

18:01.203 --> 18:02.736
All right, local debridement
around the abscess

18:02.805 --> 18:05.306
- is not gonna work.
- And what will?

18:05.373 --> 18:06.473
We have to keep resecting
muscle until we find ourselves

18:06.541 --> 18:09.610
a clean margin. Knife, please.

18:09.678 --> 18:10.845
Want me to just keep retracting as you go?

18:10.913 --> 18:12.880
Yes, please.

18:12.948 --> 18:14.849
(Sighs) A lot of that
tissue looks necrotic.

18:14.917 --> 18:16.617
"A lot" is an understatement.

18:16.685 --> 18:18.418
Push that right in here. Can you feel that?

18:18.485 --> 18:21.354
- Oh, yeah. That muscle feels terrible.
- It's thick. All right.

18:21.422 --> 18:22.856
Change of plan. The
forearm's not salvageable.

18:22.924 --> 18:24.191
The dead muscle keeps
feeding the infection.

18:24.258 --> 18:25.391
His body's not fighting back.

18:25.459 --> 18:27.360
- Do you wanna amputate?
- Yes, I do.

18:27.428 --> 18:29.996
Let's go above the elbow. Uh, go
get the amputation kit, please.

18:30.064 --> 18:31.531
Pressure's dropping.

18:31.598 --> 18:32.799
Gonna make a fishmouth incision here.

18:32.866 --> 18:33.899
All right, let's move on this one, guys.

18:33.967 --> 18:36.635
He's going into septic shock.

18:37.971 --> 18:39.671
Thank you.

18:39.739 --> 18:41.907
Right, there's the
brachial artery right there.

18:41.975 --> 18:43.508
Isolate the suture ligator.

18:43.576 --> 18:45.144
Kelly?

18:45.212 --> 18:47.246
I'll hold that.

18:47.314 --> 18:48.314
O vicryl suture.

18:48.381 --> 18:51.249
(Monitor beeping steadily)

18:53.118 --> 18:55.653
Knife.

18:55.721 --> 18:57.989
All right, Maggie, I'm gonna cut
down through the muscle, okay?

18:58.057 --> 19:00.058
Mm-hmm.

19:00.125 --> 19:03.862
Bone saw. All right.

19:03.929 --> 19:05.162
Once we separate the arm from the body,

19:05.230 --> 19:06.196
we'll have the son of a bitch contained.

19:06.264 --> 19:09.666
(Whirs)

19:09.734 --> 19:12.002
(Buzzing)

19:12.070 --> 19:13.636
Yo, hey, friendly face!

19:13.704 --> 19:15.405
Guy who fell, hello.

19:15.473 --> 19:17.140
Hey.

19:17.208 --> 19:20.744
Hi. Um, I went to get a soda,
and now I'm all turned around.

19:20.811 --> 19:22.278
- Uh, what are you looking for?
- The rehab.

19:22.346 --> 19:25.047
That's on the sixth
floor. This is the fifth.

19:25.115 --> 19:26.883
Oh.

19:26.950 --> 19:28.117
Thank you.

19:28.185 --> 19:30.253
You're welcome. (Chuckles)

19:30.320 --> 19:31.587
So big, uh, lunch plans?

19:31.654 --> 19:34.156
Uh, well, just, um, me and a piece of pie

19:34.224 --> 19:35.524
and a whole lot of sunshine.

19:35.592 --> 19:37.492
You're welcome to join me if you want.

19:37.559 --> 19:40.996
Nah, I'm more of a drinking
in a hot tub at midnight

19:41.063 --> 19:42.097
kind of gal.

19:42.164 --> 19:44.232
Oh, party girl, huh?

19:44.300 --> 19:46.334
Not any more.

19:46.402 --> 19:47.835
It's so perverse going through all of this

19:47.904 --> 19:50.272
and realizing that
you'll never be the same.

19:50.339 --> 19:53.007
Well, that's what the rehab's for.

19:53.074 --> 19:54.875
Right.

19:54.943 --> 19:56.610
(Clears throat)

19:56.677 --> 19:59.947
Hey, uh, why'd the pie go to the dentist?

20:00.015 --> 20:01.681
I don't know. Because he needed a filling.

20:01.749 --> 20:03.083
Ah ha!

20:03.151 --> 20:04.251
(Both laugh)

20:15.896 --> 20:18.664
Sure your digestive system can handle that?

20:18.732 --> 20:21.100
I just got out of a coma, Dawn.

20:21.168 --> 20:23.569
Let me eat my pie.

20:27.173 --> 20:28.807
Oh, I'm over the fact
that you tried to kill me,

20:28.874 --> 20:31.109
in case that's what you're wondering.

20:32.878 --> 20:34.146
Alex told you about that.

20:34.213 --> 20:36.481
No, she didn't.

20:36.549 --> 20:38.083
She's got class, Dawn.

20:40.486 --> 20:42.353
Well, so then how'd you
hear about the D.N.R.?

20:42.421 --> 20:45.622
See, when I was in my
coma... (Clears throat)

20:45.690 --> 20:47.691
I walked around the hospital in a tuxedo.

20:47.759 --> 20:49.693
I was invisible.

20:49.761 --> 20:52.396
And I saw everything that happened here,

20:52.464 --> 20:56.200
including when you
turned off my ventilator.

20:56.268 --> 20:58.568
Oh. And I talked to dead people.

20:58.635 --> 21:01.271
Charlie, you're just as
funny as you were before.

21:01.339 --> 21:02.772
I'm hilarious.

21:02.840 --> 21:06.409
You know, I once had a patient

21:06.477 --> 21:11.381
who described an entire coronary
artery bypass graft from above.

21:11.449 --> 21:13.482
She said she drifted out of her body,

21:13.549 --> 21:15.550
and she didn't float back
in until I stitched her up.

21:15.618 --> 21:17.152
I talked to ghosts.

21:17.220 --> 21:20.189
What's Alex say about it?

21:24.760 --> 21:26.160
I believe you.

21:28.664 --> 21:30.031
What?

21:30.099 --> 21:33.034
I don't know why I believe you, but I do.

21:33.102 --> 21:34.903
Who knows, right?

21:37.539 --> 21:39.039
Oh.

21:39.107 --> 21:40.741
By the way...

21:40.809 --> 21:42.643
I'm working here again.

21:44.479 --> 21:46.580
Oh, to bury the lead, Dawn.

21:46.648 --> 21:49.282
Well, Kinney made me a very generous offer.

21:49.350 --> 21:53.720
Can I wheel you somewhere?

22:00.427 --> 22:01.861
All right, we've achieved hemostasis.

22:01.929 --> 22:03.295
He's not bleeding any more.

22:03.363 --> 22:05.565
Don't see any infection.

22:05.633 --> 22:07.033
- How much blood loss?
- Very little.

22:07.100 --> 22:08.100
You know, we got control
of the vascular structures

22:08.168 --> 22:09.635
right from the get-go. Why do you ask?

22:09.702 --> 22:11.336
He's had a lot of fluid, and
I can't keep his pressure up.

22:11.404 --> 22:13.204
- Start him on vasopressin.
- Could he still be in septic shock?

22:13.272 --> 22:14.940
No, septic shook's in the bag
here with the rest of his arm.

22:15.008 --> 22:16.775
Oh, why isn't this kid perking up?

22:16.843 --> 22:20.211
- Are you giving him the stuff?
- Yeah. His pressure should be up.

22:20.279 --> 22:22.213
Damn it. Infection's shifted our
margins. (Monitor beeping erratically)

22:22.281 --> 22:23.549
Okay, we're gonna keep debriding, then.

22:23.616 --> 22:25.482
His pressure's tanking.
I need a central line.

22:25.551 --> 22:27.518
Open up a central line kit, please.

22:27.586 --> 22:29.887
(Erratic beeping continues)

22:29.955 --> 22:31.288
All right, that's what's
happening with your arm.

22:31.356 --> 22:33.591
Knife, please.

22:33.659 --> 22:35.626
(Monitor beeps rapidly)

22:35.694 --> 22:38.529
Make an incision to expose the tricep here.

22:38.597 --> 22:39.964
I need retractors in here, please.

22:40.032 --> 22:42.465
Got him on 50 mics per K.G.,
and he's barely holding on.

22:42.533 --> 22:43.934
'Cause the infection's in his blood now.

22:44.001 --> 22:44.935
We got our source control.

22:45.002 --> 22:45.969
- Joel.
- What is it?

22:46.037 --> 22:47.571
Wire's not advancing.

22:47.638 --> 22:48.972
You in the vein?

22:49.040 --> 22:50.707
Yep. I drew dark blood. I'm in the vein...

22:50.775 --> 22:53.209
Can't get it through. I don't
know what I'm doing wrong.

22:53.277 --> 22:54.811
- Woman: Hurry it up, Lin.
- Shut up!

22:54.879 --> 22:55.812
Okay, just take it easy a second.

22:55.880 --> 22:57.680
Mag, back it up, okay?

22:57.747 --> 22:59.347
Show it to me.

22:59.415 --> 23:02.585
Now thumb and forefinger.
Just bend it ever so slightly.

23:03.887 --> 23:05.654
That's it. Swivel the guard wire.

23:05.722 --> 23:06.722
Gentle pressure.

23:06.790 --> 23:07.723
(Rapid beeps)

23:07.791 --> 23:09.257
You good?

23:09.325 --> 23:10.492
Okay. Wire's in.

23:10.560 --> 23:11.694
Bacteria's doubling every eight minutes.

23:11.761 --> 23:12.860
We don't have any time left.

23:12.928 --> 23:14.161
This thing is like a forest fire.

23:14.229 --> 23:15.496
Heart rate's up to 130.

23:15.564 --> 23:16.831
If this infection spreads into his chest,

23:16.899 --> 23:17.966
we're not gonna have any
tissue to make a margin.

23:18.033 --> 23:19.067
- And then what?
- And then nothing.

23:19.134 --> 23:20.802
Then he dies.

23:32.014 --> 23:33.948
Hi, Alex.

23:34.016 --> 23:35.783
Dawn.

23:35.851 --> 23:38.553
Last time we were here was
under less happy circumstances.

23:40.788 --> 23:42.055
So... have you seen Charlie?

23:42.124 --> 23:44.992
Yes, I just bumped into
him on his lunch break.

23:45.059 --> 23:46.327
What, do you got a tracking bracelet

23:46.394 --> 23:47.461
on his ankle or something?

23:47.529 --> 23:50.797
(Chuckles) No.

23:50.865 --> 23:52.065
I guess you heard the news.

23:52.134 --> 23:53.667
I have. So why Hope Zion?

23:53.735 --> 23:54.868
I mean, there's a thousand hospitals

23:54.936 --> 23:56.336
you could have gone to, you know.

23:56.403 --> 23:59.038
Well, they needed a
head of cardiac surgery,

23:59.106 --> 24:00.940
and this feels like home.

24:01.008 --> 24:05.845
Alex, I would like to
mentor you if you'll let me,

24:05.912 --> 24:07.713
as two female surgeons.

24:07.781 --> 24:09.882
Charlie's my mentor.

24:09.950 --> 24:12.752
Yeah.

24:12.819 --> 24:15.454
- He's making a phenomenal recovery.
- Mm-hmm.

24:15.522 --> 24:16.822
How are you finding him?

24:16.890 --> 24:18.524
I'm finding him walking and talking

24:18.591 --> 24:21.627
and really freaking alive, Dawn.

24:21.695 --> 24:24.596
Medium, to the top, please.

24:24.665 --> 24:26.598
My regular.

24:26.667 --> 24:27.867
Medium top roast.

24:27.934 --> 24:30.101
Don't take this the wrong way, Alex.

24:30.169 --> 24:31.770
Charlie keeps secrets,

24:31.837 --> 24:35.674
and sometimes he doesn't even
realize that he's doing it.

24:35.741 --> 24:36.908
Can you do me a favor, Dawn,

24:36.976 --> 24:38.609
from one female surgeon to another?

24:38.678 --> 24:42.814
Just stay out of my private life.

24:42.882 --> 24:44.782
(Cash register beeps)

24:44.849 --> 24:47.851
I only meant well.

24:47.919 --> 24:51.555
- I'm very happy for you both.
- Thank you.

24:51.622 --> 24:53.390
<i>You're welcome.</i>

24:53.457 --> 24:55.492
And I'm buying your coffee. Okay.

24:55.560 --> 24:58.896
(Indistinct conversations)

24:58.963 --> 25:00.564
Hey, Zach, do you have a minute?

25:00.631 --> 25:01.831
Yeah.

25:01.899 --> 25:05.467
Okay. (Sighs) I'm having a hardimime

25:05.535 --> 25:08.637
delivering some bad news,
and I need your advice.

25:08.706 --> 25:11.340
I tell people horrible
things all the time. Hit me.

25:11.408 --> 25:15.277
Jackie, the woman who came
in with the feeding tube...

25:15.345 --> 25:17.612
she has a stage 4 adenocarcinoma.

25:17.680 --> 25:19.514
That's horrible.

25:19.582 --> 25:20.782
Yeah, and I went into the room.

25:20.850 --> 25:25.253
I had my speech prepared, and I... I froze.

25:25.321 --> 25:26.788
She's got two little kids.

25:26.856 --> 25:28.123
I don't know what's wrong with me.

25:28.191 --> 25:30.926
I give bad news to nice
people all the time.

25:30.993 --> 25:32.094
So what's different about her?

25:32.161 --> 25:34.428
(Sighs) She's so happy.

25:34.495 --> 25:37.064
And so were you. I mean,
Charlie went into a coma

25:37.132 --> 25:38.766
on your wedding day.

25:38.834 --> 25:41.268
Her best day is about to become
her worst, just like yours,

25:41.336 --> 25:43.037
and I could go on.

25:43.105 --> 25:45.906
I should know how to
separate myself from myself.

25:45.974 --> 25:48.408
Well... you just lost your nerve.

25:48.476 --> 25:50.844
Thanks.

25:50.911 --> 25:53.146
Hey, don't you normally talk to Charlie

25:53.214 --> 25:55.715
about this kind of stuff?

25:55.783 --> 25:58.417
Yeah, I do.

25:59.987 --> 26:02.889
We found something when
we did your surgery...

26:02.957 --> 26:05.057
a gastric cancer.

26:05.125 --> 26:06.658
We removed it,

26:06.726 --> 26:09.427
but it has metastasized.

26:09.495 --> 26:10.963
Jackie, your cancer has metas...

26:11.030 --> 26:12.631
- No! I don't have cancer.
- Jackie, Jackie, just...

26:12.698 --> 26:15.067
I can't! Your diagnosis is wrong!

26:15.135 --> 26:16.668
Go to hell!

26:16.736 --> 26:18.170
I hope you get cancer! Shh.

26:18.238 --> 26:21.305
(Gasps) I'm sorry. That
was the wrong thing to say.

26:21.373 --> 26:22.306
I'm sorry.

26:22.374 --> 26:23.775
No, that is okay.

26:23.842 --> 26:26.510
I... I want a second opinion.

26:26.578 --> 26:27.845
Absolutely.

26:27.913 --> 26:30.514
And... a time. How long?

26:30.582 --> 26:35.286
The 5-year survival rate
is 2% if you do chemo.

26:35.353 --> 26:38.088
We're supposed to go on
our honeymoon next summer

26:38.156 --> 26:39.555
with the kids.

26:39.623 --> 26:41.624
Yeah, we're driving to
the desert... Death Valley.

26:41.692 --> 26:44.360
(Laughs)

26:44.428 --> 26:47.597
(Voice breaking) It's so beautiful there.

26:48.900 --> 26:52.602
This is a conservative prognosis,

26:52.670 --> 26:54.203
and, Jackie, there are
all kinds of variables

26:54.271 --> 26:56.105
that we can't know about.

26:56.173 --> 26:58.040
I know you need to plan for the future.

26:58.108 --> 27:03.712
<i>Oh! God. My future had me in it.</i>

27:03.780 --> 27:06.215
(Sniffles)

27:06.283 --> 27:08.284
We keep searching for a
clean margin. There isn't one.

27:08.351 --> 27:10.118
If it reaches the torso,
it's over. Nothing you can do.

27:10.186 --> 27:12.586
I know, Dana. We just have
to keep amputating the bottom.

27:12.654 --> 27:13.621
- Maggie: Joel?
- Yeah.

27:13.689 --> 27:15.523
Look at this.

27:15.590 --> 27:17.025
It's checking.

27:17.092 --> 27:18.993
Oh, God. It's spreading to the shoulder.

27:19.061 --> 27:20.228
Then you don't have a margin.

27:20.296 --> 27:21.429
- You know what? We'll make one.
- What?

27:21.496 --> 27:22.797
We'll do scapulo-thoracic disarticulation.

27:22.865 --> 27:24.199
What, you wanna cut off his arm

27:24.266 --> 27:26.033
and carve out a chunk of his chest as well?

27:26.100 --> 27:29.436
- I know that it's radical.
- It's for cancer, not necrotizing fasciitis.

27:29.503 --> 27:31.872
- Have you ever done one?
- No.

27:31.940 --> 27:34.374
- Have you even seen one?
- No, I haven't, but you know what?

27:34.442 --> 27:35.843
By the time we're finished
arguing about this,

27:35.910 --> 27:37.878
it's gonna be too late.
I do not want to give up

27:37.946 --> 27:39.512
on a 22-year-old kid who could
maybe live if we did this.

27:39.580 --> 27:41.948
You know what? Why am I even
arguing with you about this?

27:42.015 --> 27:43.182
What are you gonna do? You gonna fire me?

27:43.250 --> 27:45.184
Hell, no. I'm scrubbing in.

27:45.252 --> 27:48.220
- Wait.
- Happy?

27:48.287 --> 27:50.689
I do like getting my own way.

27:50.757 --> 27:53.525
Let's get reycraft in
here. We need those hands.

27:53.593 --> 27:57.429
(Sighs) Let's roll him.

27:57.497 --> 27:58.864
Okay, I'm gonna make the incision

27:58.931 --> 28:00.566
longitudinally along
the spine of the scapula.

28:00.633 --> 28:02.334
Kinney: Soft tissue coverage
is better with a "Y" incision.

28:02.402 --> 28:04.369
- Okay, I'll meet you there.
- No, I need bigger retractors.

28:04.436 --> 28:07.872
- Go get her a Jackson.
- Okay, uh, there's the jugular. Metz, please.

28:07.939 --> 28:09.006
There's some bleeding. That's a good sign.

28:09.074 --> 28:10.274
- Liters are good.
- Large hemoclip.

28:10.342 --> 28:12.710
I'm gonna release pec major and minor.

28:12.778 --> 28:14.712
Back into the insertion.

28:14.780 --> 28:17.081
Hey, come on, Joel. Gotta
give me some room here.

28:17.148 --> 28:18.883
Go ahead. This is sensitive stuff.

28:18.950 --> 28:22.586
- Usually I try to make this pretty.
- It's meatball surgery.

28:22.653 --> 28:25.655
All right, I'm suctioning
the brachial plexus. 15 blade.

28:25.723 --> 28:27.591
All right. Almost.

28:27.658 --> 28:29.225
- Bennett retractors.
- Okay, hold on, guys.

28:29.293 --> 28:31.862
We have a perforator. Satinsky.

28:33.598 --> 28:34.731
You ready, Kinney?

28:34.799 --> 28:36.331
Yep. You do the honors.

28:36.400 --> 28:37.533
Here we go.

28:45.776 --> 28:47.276
All right, you can take that to pathology.

28:47.343 --> 28:49.378
That's, um, that's a big hole.

28:49.446 --> 28:50.513
Yeah.

28:50.580 --> 28:51.880
You wanna wait 15 minutes,

28:51.947 --> 28:53.147
- make sure we have a clear margin?
- No.

28:53.215 --> 28:54.282
Bandage him up. Get him off the table.

28:54.349 --> 28:56.418
- Get him into I.C.U.
- And then what?

28:56.485 --> 28:58.953
Give this guy every single
antibiotic known to man.

28:59.021 --> 29:01.122
Hope that someone's praying for him.

29:13.367 --> 29:15.302
(Sighs)

29:15.369 --> 29:18.071
Gino said I'd find you here. He seems good.

29:18.139 --> 29:19.773
No, Gino's great.

29:19.841 --> 29:21.575
So everything's going well.

29:21.643 --> 29:24.844
Yeah. Kinney's got my job.
Goran's seeing all my patients.

29:24.912 --> 29:26.946
I'm practically Rip Van Orthopod.

29:27.013 --> 29:30.616
It's very, very, very... strange.

29:30.684 --> 29:32.985
Let's get married.

29:35.823 --> 29:37.156
That's out of the blue.

29:37.223 --> 29:40.859
Well, we didn't get
to, and I still want to.

29:40.927 --> 29:43.462
Do you? I mean, we never
talked about it at all.

29:43.529 --> 29:48.333
Baby, of course I do. I
just... I don't... wanna...

29:48.400 --> 29:51.436
wheel down the aisle, you know?

29:51.504 --> 29:53.638
I wanna be the man I was before for you.

29:53.706 --> 29:55.139
Yeah, but I'm not talking about a wedding.

29:55.207 --> 29:56.607
I don't care about some stupid party.

29:56.675 --> 29:58.241
I don't want to get married.

29:58.309 --> 29:59.910
<i>I just want to be married to you,</i>

29:59.978 --> 30:01.812
and maybe it's crazy, but we didn't get to,

30:01.880 --> 30:04.515
and what if we don't, and I just...

30:04.583 --> 30:05.983
I can't lose you again.

30:06.050 --> 30:08.452
Well, what are you doing today?

30:08.520 --> 30:10.420
Charlie, I didn't mean today.

30:10.489 --> 30:12.989
No, I... I wanna get married,
too, so what's your day like?

30:13.056 --> 30:14.357
Why wait?

30:14.424 --> 30:15.692
Really?

30:15.759 --> 30:17.126
Yeah. I can get a justice of the peace

30:17.194 --> 30:20.396
for... 7:00, and we can
meet in the hospital garden.

30:20.464 --> 30:21.664
Just one small detail.

30:21.732 --> 30:22.999
What?

30:23.066 --> 30:24.000
I'm not wearing a tux.

30:24.067 --> 30:26.335
(Laughs) Deal.

30:26.403 --> 30:27.669
Garden at 7:00.

30:27.737 --> 30:30.372
Married by 7:15.

30:39.059 --> 30:40.660
No, we are not inviting anyone, Mel.

30:40.661 --> 30:41.594
Why can't you wait and have a real wedding?

30:41.662 --> 30:43.663
We'll have a party...
in a couple of months.

30:43.731 --> 30:46.298
That's not the same.
The deal with a wedding

30:46.366 --> 30:49.034
is that you publicly declare your love.

30:49.101 --> 30:50.836
Plus I really want to
be in the wedding party.

30:51.403 --> 30:52.804
We already tried this.

30:52.872 --> 30:54.806
We're just gonna have
a small, private moment.

30:55.842 --> 30:57.642
Fine.

30:57.710 --> 30:59.010
What are you gonna wear?

30:59.078 --> 31:01.478
- I don't care.
- Y...

31:01.546 --> 31:03.981
you're killing me here.

31:04.049 --> 31:07.117
(Monitor beeping steadily)

31:11.890 --> 31:13.991
It's so weird.

31:14.059 --> 31:17.260
I haven't seen him sleep in years.

31:17.328 --> 31:19.695
I'm Wes' father... Peter.

31:19.763 --> 31:22.165
I'm Joel Goran... his doctor.

31:22.233 --> 31:25.168
So, uh, you, uh...

31:25.236 --> 31:26.870
you had to... to take out...

31:26.937 --> 31:28.471
I know it doesn't exactly look like a win,

31:28.538 --> 31:30.606
but, you know, it was the
only thing that we could do

31:30.674 --> 31:32.242
to save his life.

31:32.309 --> 31:34.209
Your son is recovering very well.

31:36.045 --> 31:37.880
He's not my son anymore, really.

31:37.947 --> 31:40.148
Well, he's gonna need your help.

31:40.216 --> 31:41.750
Oh, I'll give it to him.

31:41.817 --> 31:43.986
But, um...

31:44.053 --> 31:47.756
my son was... good at math.

31:47.823 --> 31:50.691
He, uh... he loved trains.

31:50.759 --> 31:53.560
He had a stutter till he was 9.

31:53.628 --> 31:57.298
We got a dog, and suddenly
he could talk perfectly.

31:57.366 --> 31:59.367
I never knew how that worked.

31:59.434 --> 32:03.704
I don't know what happened to him.

32:05.072 --> 32:07.507
How it all got so bad.

32:07.574 --> 32:09.709
Well, you can talk to him
about it when he wakes up.

32:14.415 --> 32:16.082
(Sighs)

32:17.151 --> 32:18.785
Maybe this is what he needs.

32:18.852 --> 32:20.453
Rock bottom.

32:20.521 --> 32:25.624
Maybe... he'll wake up
and... turn it all around.

32:28.995 --> 32:30.595
Maybe.

32:32.465 --> 32:35.534
(Equipment clattering)

32:38.304 --> 32:40.638
(Hums)

32:43.675 --> 32:45.310
That looks like a fun game.

32:45.377 --> 32:46.710
Shh!

32:46.778 --> 32:48.579
You sorting by colors?

32:48.647 --> 32:50.614
- It's the ace, Charlie.
- What does that mean?

32:50.682 --> 32:52.083
It means you gotta switch
and sort by suits now, right?

32:52.151 --> 32:53.417
Mm-hmm.

32:55.853 --> 32:56.987
Ay... ta-da!

32:57.055 --> 32:58.455
(Beeps) 65 seconds.

32:58.522 --> 32:59.923
Not too shabby.

32:59.991 --> 33:01.024
I thought you came out of the coma.

33:01.092 --> 33:03.226
- Do it again.
- Yeah.

33:03.294 --> 33:04.627
Gino's such a hard-ass.

33:04.695 --> 33:05.996
It's just his way of finding out

33:06.064 --> 33:08.165
whether I have hidden brain damage.

33:08.232 --> 33:09.265
I'm Charlie, by the way.

33:09.333 --> 33:11.733
Pamela. Do you?

33:11.801 --> 33:13.502
- What?
- Have brain damage?

33:13.570 --> 33:14.770
No.

33:14.838 --> 33:16.272
'Cause I think I do. (Chuckles)

33:16.340 --> 33:19.108
I have no idea what you're doing there.

33:19.176 --> 33:21.877
I don't think I'm dealing that well.

33:21.945 --> 33:23.579
What's wrong with your leg?

33:23.646 --> 33:24.746
I don't know. What are you, a doctor?

33:24.814 --> 33:25.947
As a matter of fact, I am.

33:26.015 --> 33:28.316
Maybe you could take a look at it later.

33:28.384 --> 33:30.452
Maybe I could.

33:30.519 --> 33:32.553
(Slapping cards on table)

33:32.621 --> 33:35.656
(Monitor beeping steadily)

33:37.493 --> 33:39.494
It's good.

33:42.964 --> 33:46.600
(Inhales and sighs)

33:46.667 --> 33:49.436
I mean, is it all like this?

33:49.504 --> 33:51.938
You never read Baudelaire?

33:52.007 --> 33:53.640
(Clicks tongue) Um, no.

33:53.708 --> 33:56.243
I was kind of busy doing other things.

33:56.311 --> 33:58.144
Like what?

33:58.212 --> 34:00.413
Like medicine.

34:05.684 --> 34:08.686
"My soul is cracked."

34:13.525 --> 34:15.927
Is that the way you feel?

34:17.330 --> 34:20.498
If you're being simpleminded, sure.

34:23.668 --> 34:28.472
He found beauty in ugliness.

34:28.540 --> 34:31.675
He was fighting for his individuality.

34:34.978 --> 34:38.348
He wanted to be a man on his own terms,

34:38.416 --> 34:41.784
against society or whatever.

34:43.987 --> 34:47.723
I get bored.

34:47.791 --> 34:51.061
So I try to make things interesting.

34:55.065 --> 34:58.200
You might want to rethink that philosophy.

34:59.702 --> 35:02.371
Yeah.

35:05.875 --> 35:08.676
Hi. How's he doing?

35:10.079 --> 35:12.280
He's doing okay.

35:17.286 --> 35:18.686
(Pen clicks)

35:23.292 --> 35:25.125
Dr. Reid, I don't want treatment.

35:25.193 --> 35:26.726
You don't have to make that decision now.

35:26.794 --> 35:30.297
(Scoffs) Here.
Have a seat. (Pats bed)

35:32.233 --> 35:33.933
Here's my plan.

35:34.001 --> 35:38.305
I want to spend time
with my family before...

35:38.372 --> 35:39.973
I go.

35:40.040 --> 35:41.540
Treatment doesn't preclude that.

35:41.608 --> 35:44.009
Uhh. My cousin had chemo,

35:44.077 --> 35:45.744
and it didn't make her life any longer,

35:45.812 --> 35:47.246
but it sure did seem longer.

35:47.314 --> 35:49.281
Still, it could give you more time.

35:49.349 --> 35:51.083
Yeah, I don't want that kind of time.

35:51.151 --> 35:55.254
I don't want to spend the
last six months of my life

35:55.322 --> 35:58.256
barfing, with sores inside of my throat,

35:58.324 --> 36:00.725
barely able to stand up.

36:00.792 --> 36:03.561
I'm so happy right now.

36:03.629 --> 36:05.930
I just want to take advantage

36:05.998 --> 36:10.435
of every single moment that I have left.

36:11.870 --> 36:13.337
I do.

36:16.474 --> 36:18.008
How do you feel?

36:18.075 --> 36:20.144
(Inhales) It's good.

36:20.211 --> 36:21.778
Good. Good. A lot of guys get discouraged

36:21.846 --> 36:23.647
from the parallel bars or whatever,

36:23.714 --> 36:25.215
and then I get 'em out
here and they're like

36:25.283 --> 36:26.916
astronauts walking on the moon.

36:26.984 --> 36:29.485
Okay, now I want you to try
to walk the length of the pool.

36:29.553 --> 36:31.420
(Inhales) Yeah, I got this.

36:31.488 --> 36:34.590
I've heard that before. I'll
be here just in case. (Spits)

36:34.658 --> 36:36.792
(Exhales)

36:41.064 --> 36:42.598
Hey!

36:42.666 --> 36:45.033
Look at you, working so hard.

36:45.100 --> 36:47.969
Yeah. This pool must be great for your leg.

36:48.037 --> 36:49.504
Water's not really my thing.

36:49.572 --> 36:51.473
I'm just wandering, you
know, between appointments.

36:51.541 --> 36:53.475
(Chuckles and sighs)

36:53.543 --> 36:54.476
Hey, I'm getting married.

36:54.544 --> 36:57.312
Good for you.

36:57.380 --> 36:58.547
- Who's the lucky girl?
- She's a...

36:58.614 --> 37:00.914
she's a doctor here at the hospital.

37:03.918 --> 37:05.486
Come on in here!

37:05.554 --> 37:07.588
Don't make me do this all by myself.

37:07.656 --> 37:09.490
I can't swim. (Exhales)

37:09.558 --> 37:11.024
- Hey, Charlie?
- What?

37:11.092 --> 37:13.927
- Who are you talking to?
- Pamela.

37:15.530 --> 37:17.597
Charlie, there's nobody here.

37:37.148 --> 37:40.484
(Indistinct conversations)

37:40.551 --> 37:42.752
Hey, Joel, just the man I wanted to see.

37:42.820 --> 37:44.220
Hey, Bryan.

37:44.287 --> 37:45.922
Heard what you did for
that kid with nec-fasc.

37:45.990 --> 37:47.390
Yeah, it worked out.

37:47.457 --> 37:48.691
Some last day.

37:48.759 --> 37:50.393
You bet.

37:50.460 --> 37:52.595
But it doesn't have to be.

37:52.663 --> 37:54.296
What do you mean?

37:54.364 --> 37:56.399
I have something that I
think might change your mind.

37:56.466 --> 37:58.366
Okay. You have five minutes?

37:58.434 --> 38:00.101
Yeah, sure.

38:04.073 --> 38:08.043
(Microwave beeps, door opens and closes)

38:13.148 --> 38:15.149
You hurt my feelings earlier.

38:15.216 --> 38:16.216
Okay.

38:16.284 --> 38:17.618
I didn't mean to.

38:17.686 --> 38:20.021
I am full on. That's who I am.

38:20.088 --> 38:22.322
Maybe you think I'm some
kind of slut or something,

38:22.390 --> 38:23.824
and that makes you uncomfortable.

38:23.892 --> 38:25.793
No, I don't think that.
And I'm not uncomfortable.

38:25.861 --> 38:27.127
You dated that Hannah girl,

38:27.195 --> 38:29.796
and I wasn't threatened by that... much.

38:29.864 --> 38:31.731
This feels real to me.

38:31.799 --> 38:34.367
Feels real to me, too.

38:34.435 --> 38:36.803
And that's scary. It's huge.

38:36.871 --> 38:41.507
So... you wanna take it slow?

38:50.183 --> 38:53.218
(Indistinct conversations)

38:58.091 --> 39:01.459
(Laughs)

39:01.526 --> 39:04.295
I don't know. I... I... we
either have a curse or a blessing.

39:04.362 --> 39:06.197
I have never had such crazy surgeries

39:06.264 --> 39:07.799
with another doctor in my life.

39:07.866 --> 39:10.334
- That's true. So weird, isn't it?
- It really is. I just...

39:10.402 --> 39:13.905
(Sighs) You know, I think there's, um...

39:13.973 --> 39:15.940
I think there's some
chemistry in there, too...

39:16.008 --> 39:18.341
professionally, you know.

39:18.409 --> 39:24.715
- Anyway, I'm gonna miss you,
and I'm just wondering if you...
- Hey, I should talk to, um...

39:24.782 --> 39:27.417
Wanted to, you know, maybe
go out for a drink or... two.
