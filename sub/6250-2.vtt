00:02.378 --> 00:05.666
You know What
the most beaut/fu/ thmg
in the war/0’ is?

00:05.798 --> 00:07.709
Mom says the sunset.
Okay.

00:07.800 --> 00:09.916
Well, one ofthe most
beautiful man-made things.

00:10.052 --> 00:13.180
Mom says the Mona [Isa
Okay, look, all due
respect to your mom, buddy,

00:13.264 --> 00:17.382
but a perfectly thrown
spiral is way better
than any ofthat stuff.

00:17.476 --> 00:19.387
So let me show you
how you do it.

00:19.478 --> 00:23.096
Put your hand up here like that.
Spread your fingers wide.

00:23.232 --> 00:25.723
My hands too small.
It’ll grow, all right.
Okay.

00:25.818 --> 00:28.355
Hand there to steady the ball.
Lift it up to your ear.

00:28.487 --> 00:32.275
No, your ear. Not your
chin, silly. All right.
What’s it saying?

00:32.408 --> 00:35.400
It’s saying, “Throw your old man
a deep pass for a touchdown.”
Hike!

00:35.494 --> 00:37.951
[Laughs]
What? What you got?

00:38.039 --> 00:39.995
[Grunts]

00:40.124 --> 00:43.082
Hey, there’s a bird’s nest.
Where?

00:43.211 --> 00:45.122
There.
0/7, (00/. Huh?

00:45.213 --> 00:47.374
Hey, you want me to lift
you up so you can see inside?

00:47.465 --> 00:50.548
- How about | knock it down
with a perfect spiral?
- No, no, no, don’t do that.

00:50.635 --> 00:52.671
That’s somebody’s home.
Okay, buddy?

00:52.762 --> 00:55.925
Something could be alive
in there, okay? So you want me
to boost you up so you can see?

00:56.057 --> 00:58.548
Sure. Yeah.
You ready?
One, two, three.

00:58.684 --> 01:02.051
Higher. A little higher.
What do you see up there?
Higher? Okay.

01:02.146 --> 01:05.388
- | see something.
- If it’s an egg, don’t touch it.
Ifthe mommy bird comes back—

01:05.483 --> 01:07.895
It’s not an egg.
What is it?

01:07.985 --> 01:10.692
It’s somebody’s finger.

01:15.243 --> 01:19.077
- [ Brennan] He pulled the finger
out ofa bird’s nest.
- Did he completely freak out?

01:19.163 --> 01:22.326
Booth said Parker wanted
to put it in his pocket
and take it home.

01:22.416 --> 01:24.907
When it comes to boys,
that “snips and snails...

01:25.002 --> 01:27.209
and puppy dogs’ tails” thing
is pretty accurate.

01:27.338 --> 01:28.999
You have a son?
I have four.

01:29.090 --> 01:31.376
Mr. Starret is my oldest
grad student

01:31.509 --> 01:34.046
Can you get a fingerprint?
[Saroyan]
Not enough ﬂesh.

01:34.136 --> 01:37.879
There are scrapes on the bone
and a jagged appearance here
where it was severed.

01:37.974 --> 01:40.181
[Brennan]
It was probably chewed off
by a wild animal.

01:40.268 --> 01:45.058
Sticky stuff on the finger—
turns out to be sap from
a floweringJapanese cherry.

01:45.147 --> 01:48.014
I know you from somewhere.

01:50.653 --> 01:55.397
Right. I sold you
a vintage ’505 hot rod
back in the mid-’90s.

01:55.533 --> 01:58.525
You were clean-shaven
backthen.
Because I was a kid.

01:58.619 --> 02:00.280
You drove a hot rod, Hodgins?

02:00.371 --> 02:03.784
No, I did not.
The lemon he sold me
broke down after a week.

02:03.874 --> 02:08.163
Body parts in par/c
M yste/y needs solving.

02:08.254 --> 02:12.748
The nest was made by
a Corvus brachyrhynchos—
the American crow.

02:12.842 --> 02:16.050
A crow will seldom stray
more than 72 miles
from its nest

02:16.137 --> 02:20.756
There’s a spectacular copse
ofJapanese ﬂowering cherry
at theJefferson Memorial.

02:20.891 --> 02:23.553
How do you know?
Career number two:
park supervisor.

02:23.644 --> 02:27.011
The/efferson Memorial ’s
eight miles from Where Par/(er
found the finger.

02:27.106 --> 02:30.815
- Good work, guys.
- I’d say “king ofthe lab,” but...

02:30.901 --> 02:32.607
thatjust depresses me.

02:34.322 --> 02:36.529
Don’t ask.

02:36.657 --> 02:39.649
A human finger?
Yes, a human finger.
All right?

02:39.744 --> 02:43.236
Is my son gonna be suffering
from some kind of
posttraumatic stress?

02:43.331 --> 02:46.289
Like suppressed feelings,
memories— all that hooey?

02:46.375 --> 02:48.787
Well, a child’s brain
can’t process death
as an end.

02:48.878 --> 02:52.962
That’s why we tell children
their deceased loved ones are
looking down on us from heaven.

02:53.090 --> 02:56.048
Which they are.
Yeah, it’s an excellent
coping technique.

02:56.135 --> 02:59.923
Grandma isn’t worm food.
She’s simply moved on
to a better place.

03:00.056 --> 03:02.172
Which she did.
Parker looks good to me.

03:02.266 --> 03:05.975
- 50, you talk to him?
- Hi, Parker. I’m Dr. Sweets.

03:06.062 --> 03:09.475
I’m a psychologist and
I’m here to talk to you about
the human finger you found.

03:09.607 --> 03:13.941
Great. Could you do that?
No. That could introduce issues
that don’t currently exist.

03:14.028 --> 03:16.440
Just call me if he displays
any symptoms of distress.

03:16.530 --> 03:21.274
Okay. Any symptoms of distress.
Like, urn, killing cats?

03:21.369 --> 03:23.655
Yeah, sure.

03:28.709 --> 03:32.042
[Brennan ] When I was five
years old, I went next door to
visit our neighbor Mrs. Walky.

03:32.129 --> 03:36.042
And she was dead, sitting
at the kitchen table.
And I’m all right.

03:36.133 --> 03:38.670
You spend your life
with skeletons.

03:38.761 --> 03:40.843
It’sjust a matter oftime.
He’sjust a kid.

03:40.930 --> 03:43.717
He’s gonna realize that he
had a dead finger in his hand.
He’s gonna freak out.

03:43.808 --> 03:45.673
You afraid you’re gonna get
in trouble with Rebecca?

03:45.810 --> 03:49.018
There’s a chance that he might
not say anything to her.
So, yes.

03:49.105 --> 03:51.061
- [ Man ] Agent Booth?
- Yeah.

03:51.148 --> 03:54.015
We found something.

03:54.110 --> 03:57.147
[ Booth ]
Okay, what do
you got? Whoa!

03:57.238 --> 04:01.982
- Oh, it’s an opossum.
- [Man ] Eat/ng a body
Should / shoot it?

04:02.076 --> 04:04.943
No, no, no. Opossums
are scared ofhumans.

04:05.037 --> 04:08.950
Here. Shoo, shoo, shoo!
Shoo, shoo! Go, go, go, go!

04:09.041 --> 04:13.159
Go, go, go. Shoo, shoo.
Come on. Shoo, shoo, shoo!
Shoo, shoo, shoo!

04:13.254 --> 04:15.916
- Yeah, they’re terrified.
- A number of body parts
are missing

04:16.006 --> 04:17.917
We 7/ have to grid
the wan/2y

04:18.008 --> 04:20.670
We 7/ reca/ibra te the search
and we ’l/ call this ground zero.

04:20.761 --> 04:23.423
Fanny pack, P.D.A. clip.

04:23.514 --> 04:27.257
Well, if you can identify
this person, / can subpoena
the FDA ’5 contents

04:27.351 --> 04:29.057
Partial skull.

04:29.145 --> 04:31.477
Whoa. Look at that.
The possum’s dead.

04:31.564 --> 04:33.555
/ got it.
The victim was poisoned

04:33.649 --> 04:37.767
The possum ate the victim,
got poisoned and died. That’s it.

04:37.862 --> 04:43.448
A stressed-out opossum
can go into a false sleep
lasting up to four hours.

04:43.534 --> 04:47.823
Wow. The possum
was faking it?
U h-h u h.

04:47.913 --> 04:50.529
Wow There it goes.

04:50.624 --> 04:53.787
- Uh, you should go get h/m.
- What do I look like— Ranger Rick?

04:53.878 --> 04:56.039
He could have evidence
in his digestive tract.

04:56.172 --> 04:58.083
Come on, Bones—
Booth, evidence.

04:58.174 --> 05:00.586
- Fine. I’ll go get your possum.
- Opossum.

05:00.718 --> 05:02.379
Possum!
Opossum.

05:34.960 --> 05:39.829
The sternal rib end indicates
the victim was between
35 and 40 years old.

05:39.924 --> 05:44.634
Length ofthe long bones
suggests he was between
5’8” and 5’10”.

05:44.720 --> 05:46.711
He?

05:46.847 --> 05:50.465
Bone density and skull
indicators suggest male.
Time of death?

05:50.559 --> 05:52.515
Approximately
four days ago.

05:52.603 --> 05:56.391
Lividity indicates
that he died somewhere else
and was then dumped.

05:56.482 --> 05:59.315
Deep puncture wounds
to the trachea
pierced the jugular.

05:59.443 --> 06:02.150
He bled to death.
I’ll make an impression
ofthe wound.

06:02.238 --> 06:04.194
See ifwe can’t specify
a murder weapon.

06:04.281 --> 06:07.023
First, we look
for particulates.

06:07.159 --> 06:10.492
Bull penis.
Beg your pardon?

06:12.164 --> 06:16.248
The fanny pack had dander-sized
flakes of bull penis in it.

06:16.335 --> 06:19.543
Why are you spying on me?

06:19.630 --> 06:22.042
Could it be because
I’m the dupe ofan organ...

06:22.132 --> 06:25.420
ofthe shadowy forces
that secretly run this country?

06:25.511 --> 06:28.799
You got the dupe
part right.

06:28.889 --> 06:32.632
Freeze-dried bovine phallus.

06:34.144 --> 06:37.056
You know where to find me
ifyou wish to discuss anything.

06:37.147 --> 06:40.230
Yeah. The problem isn’t finding you.
It’s avoiding you.

06:40.317 --> 06:42.808
[Chuckles]

06:42.903 --> 06:44.894
Okay.

06:46.865 --> 06:51.154
[A nge/a ] The skull was badly
mangled so / was only able
to construct a part/al.

06:51.245 --> 06:54.988
But I cross-checked
physiological markers against
the Missing Persons database,

06:55.082 --> 06:58.574
and it yielded
three possibilities.

06:58.669 --> 07:02.161
- Okay. Robert Sanchez, 24.
- Too young.

07:03.257 --> 07:07.091
Michael Minden,
former basketball coach, 39.

07:07.177 --> 07:08.883
Too tall

07:08.971 --> 07:13.214
That leaves Dr. Seth Elliot.
l/eter/nar/an, 37.

07:13.309 --> 07:15.846
- Any objections to Dr. Elliot?
- He falls into the parameters.

07:15.936 --> 07:19.895
Plus, dog tra/ners use
freeze-dried bull penises
as rewards.

07:19.982 --> 07:23.349
- He was a veterinarian.
- How do you know about
the bull penis stuff?

07:23.444 --> 07:26.026
He’s middle-aged and
he’s held every possiblejob.

07:26.113 --> 07:29.446
Four boys, seven dogs,
14 guinea pigs,

07:29.533 --> 07:32.525
one reticulated p ython—
you get the point.

07:32.620 --> 07:35.202
I got it.

07:36.290 --> 07:38.281
[ Woman]
Oh, God

07:38.375 --> 07:40.331
| always hated
that fanny pack.

07:40.419 --> 07:42.910
That’s blood on it, isn’t it?
What happened?

07:43.047 --> 07:46.210
Mrs. Elliot, when did you
last speak with your husband?
Ex-husband.

07:46.300 --> 07:48.632
On Thursday,

07:48.719 --> 07:52.132
we made arrangements
for Seth to pick up Brando.

07:52.222 --> 07:55.055
We ha vejo/nt custody
And Brando is?

07:55.184 --> 07:57.175
[Whining]
Your cat.

07:57.269 --> 08:02.229
- That’s a dog, Booth.
- Thank you. So, Seth Elliot
never picked up Fido?

08:02.316 --> 08:03.897
- Brando.
- The dog.

08:05.486 --> 08:09.229
- Seth’s dead, isn’t he?
- I’m afraid so.

08:11.325 --> 08:13.281
Oh.
[Whining]

08:13.369 --> 08:15.280
[Murmurs]

08:16.413 --> 08:18.574
May I hold your dog
while you cry?

08:18.666 --> 08:20.657
Mm-hmm.

08:23.253 --> 08:26.586
Oh, he’s so compact.
[ Barks, Growls]

08:26.674 --> 08:28.915
Brando adored Seth.

08:30.052 --> 08:32.008
So did I.

08:32.096 --> 08:34.929
Wow. Not so many ex—wives speak
so fondly oftheir former husbands.

08:35.015 --> 08:38.007
Well, I never wanted
to divorce Seth.

08:38.102 --> 08:42.687
- Then why did you?
- Seth had a serious
gambling problem.

08:42.773 --> 08:45.185
He would either lose
our car payment...

08:45.275 --> 08:47.527
or he would come home
with diamond earrings.

08:47.611 --> 08:50.398
And when he lost our house,

08:50.489 --> 08:53.401
filing for divorce was supposed
to be a wake-up call.

08:53.492 --> 08:56.074
- And he never woke up.
- No.

08:56.161 --> 08:58.573
Listen, do you have
the boo/(ie ’5 name?

08:58.664 --> 09:01.997
No. Ask Karen.

09:02.084 --> 09:03.915
[ Both ]
Who’s Karen?
[ Barks]

09:04.002 --> 09:07.665
I’ve been Dr. Elliot’s assistant,
receptionist,

09:07.756 --> 09:10.668
whatever, for, like, eight months.

09:10.759 --> 09:12.624
Murder?

09:12.761 --> 09:16.504
His remains were found
in thejefferson Memorial Park.
Oh, my God.

09:16.598 --> 09:19.726
Poor Seth. I don’t know what’ll
happen to this place now.

09:19.852 --> 09:23.561
Was it doing well?
We made barely enough
to pay the rent,

09:23.647 --> 09:26.605
cover his salary, mine
and the kid who sweeps up.

09:26.692 --> 09:29.559
So, no, not very well.

09:29.653 --> 09:31.439
Seth didn’t tell me
everything, but...

09:31.530 --> 09:34.397
I could sense he was
under a lot of pressure.

09:34.533 --> 09:37.616
Tossed and turned all night.
So you slept together.

09:37.703 --> 09:42.618
He’s divorced. I’m single.
There’s nothing enervating about it.

09:45.753 --> 09:48.244
Look, are you aware
that Dr. Elliot had
a gambling problem?

09:48.338 --> 09:50.795
That was Seth’s one fault.

09:53.093 --> 09:56.176
- I don’t think
that’s how Seth gambled.
- How did he gamble?

09:56.263 --> 09:58.094
Online poker mostly.

09:58.182 --> 10:00.343
Can you think
ofanything else?

10:00.434 --> 10:03.722
Just after I started here,
Seth caught a guy stealing drugs.

10:03.812 --> 10:06.519
He wrestled him to the ground,
called the cops.

10:06.607 --> 10:08.472
Everyone said Seth was a hero.

10:08.609 --> 10:10.474
What kind ofdrugs?
Ketamine.

10:10.569 --> 10:12.651
It’s a animal tranquilizer.

10:12.738 --> 10:16.526
And the guy went to prison.
Do you think he killed Seth
for revenge?

10:16.617 --> 10:19.654
Thank you for your help.
We’re really sorry for
your loss. Come on, Bones.

10:19.745 --> 10:22.031
Without Seth, I’m paralyzed.

10:22.122 --> 10:24.329
I don’t know how I’ll find
the energy to go on.

10:24.416 --> 10:26.327
Now that is what
enervating means.

10:26.418 --> 10:28.909
- Bones.
- What?

10:30.255 --> 10:32.166
[Brennan]
Okay. Tucker Payne.

10:32.257 --> 10:36.546
He was found guilty of stealing drugs
from Dr. Elliot’s vet clinic.

10:36.637 --> 10:39.174
Sentenced to two years,
and he was paroled
one month ago.

10:39.264 --> 10:42.973
I’ll have the drug thief’s
parole officer bring him in
for questioning. Okay?

10:43.060 --> 10:45.927
- Brennan.
- Dr. Brennan,
Hodgins found saliva.

10:46.063 --> 10:47.974
Where?
On the victim.

10:48.065 --> 10:50.021
Why was Hodgins
looking for saliva?

10:50.108 --> 10:52.520
I wasn’t looking for saliva.
I found it.

10:52.653 --> 10:55.861
Giant d/ﬁ‘erence.
Ho. Easy, pal.
Watch your tone.

10:55.948 --> 10:58.109
I don’t care about tone.
I just care about results.

10:58.200 --> 11:02.534
Dr. Hodgins was looking
for particulates on
the mandible and vertebrae...

11:02.621 --> 11:05.283
that m/ght lead to a murder
weapon when he found saliva.

11:05.374 --> 11:08.161
There was enough saliva
in the wounds to run
a DNA profile.

11:08.252 --> 11:11.790
- It had to be the possum, right?
- The puncture wounds indicate
something larger.

11:11.922 --> 11:14.664
Who’s that?
[ Hodgins ]
Fraudulent used-car salesman.

11:14.758 --> 11:16.464
Booth, meet Mr. Sta rret.

11:16.552 --> 11:19.669
I ran the standard
eight nuclear markers
for canids.

11:19.763 --> 11:21.378
What is that,
some kind ofa bug?

11:21.515 --> 11:24.928
Not a bug, Agent Booth.
C anis lupus lam/l/an's.

11:25.018 --> 11:28.510
See how annoying that
“interrupting, know-it-all,
used-car salesman” thing can be?

11:28.605 --> 11:33.770
I’m sorry. What is
“can ass familiar ass”—

11:33.861 --> 11:35.442
Domestic dog.

11:35.529 --> 11:39.488
Seth Elliot was killed
by a dog with filed teeth.

11:44.162 --> 11:45.993
Tucker Felix Payne.

11:46.081 --> 11:48.823
You reallv must hate
your parents for naming you that.

11:48.917 --> 11:51.533
It’s a good name.
Felix means “lucky.”

11:51.628 --> 11:56.042
Assault, possession
of various restricted weapons,
various drug offenses.

11:56.133 --> 11:58.044
You don’t seem so lucky.

11:58.135 --> 12:00.251
You should see the stuff
they didn’t get me on.

12:00.345 --> 12:02.757
Was it good luck
that you got taken down
by a veterinarian?

12:02.848 --> 12:05.430
I was so high I could
have been taken down
by a ﬂorist.

12:05.517 --> 12:08.133
You know the vet’s dead?

12:08.228 --> 12:11.311
You get paroled,
vet turns up murdered.
See where I’m going with this?

12:13.734 --> 12:15.395
Make your dog bark.

12:15.485 --> 12:18.522
You told me to bring
Schatzee so you could
hear him bark?

12:18.614 --> 12:21.572
- Schatzee?
- It means “treasure” in German.

12:21.658 --> 12:23.649
Yeah, / wanna hear
Schatzee bar/c

12:23.744 --> 12:27.987
- Gib taut.
- [ Barks]

12:28.123 --> 12:30.956
I can’t see its teeth.
[Growling]

12:33.253 --> 12:35.164
You wanna show me his teeth?

12:41.678 --> 12:44.090
Wow You ﬁle its teeth
down to points.

12:44.181 --> 12:48.094
I’m a drug dealer.
You people catch me with a gun,
I go away forever.

12:48.185 --> 12:51.769
- Schatzee your choice of weapon?
- Never had to use him yet.

12:51.855 --> 12:55.268
- Were you gonna shoot my dog?
- I got nothing against your dog.

12:55.359 --> 12:57.691
I was gonna shoot you.

12:59.404 --> 13:01.736
See, I’m gonna take
your dog.

13:03.700 --> 13:06.407
Oh, man, you got a warrant
for my dog?

13:06.495 --> 13:09.202
Mm-hmm.
That’s cold.

13:09.289 --> 13:12.156
Per your instructions,
I micro-sealed
the lethal bite mark.

13:12.292 --> 13:14.408
See here?
An irregularity
in the wound track.

13:14.544 --> 13:18.082
Yes. I took an impression
of Schatzee’s bite.
Who’s Schatzee?

13:18.215 --> 13:20.547
[Barks]
Drug dealer’s dog.

13:20.634 --> 13:23.876
- S ei/etzt schb'n brav.
- [ Whines ]

13:23.971 --> 13:27.179
- He responds to German commands.
- Very intimidating.

13:27.265 --> 13:31.634
The dog that killed Dr. Elliot
has a pronounced crack
in its canine tooth.

13:31.728 --> 13:33.935
And the neighboring
bicuspid shows a slab fracture.

13:34.064 --> 13:36.771
Very distinct.
So Schatzee’s not our killer.

13:36.858 --> 13:39.691
- Schatzee is innocent.
- [Barks]

13:39.820 --> 13:42.903
[Phone Rings]
Hey, Hodgins.

13:42.990 --> 13:46.608
City police found the vet’s car.
Forensics crew is going
through it now.

13:46.702 --> 13:50.035
Booth wanted me to make sure
they didn’t screw things up.

13:50.122 --> 13:52.033
Hey, deal with it.

13:52.124 --> 13:55.742
Well, /hope you find something,
’cause this puppy’s innocent.

13:55.836 --> 13:57.497
We’re finding
gobs ofdried blood.

13:57.587 --> 13:59.794
It’s a vet’s vehicle. Could be
from one of his patients.

13:59.923 --> 14:01.914
lfsnot
Don ’t listen to him.

14:02.009 --> 14:05.467
You’ll end up buying
this blood-soaked heap
for three times its value.

14:05.554 --> 14:09.217
I worked as a vet’s assistant
in college when I was studying
to be an EMT.

14:09.307 --> 14:12.140
We were as careful with blood
as any human doctor.

14:12.227 --> 14:17.221
You ever think this vet didn’t
live up to your high standards?

14:17.315 --> 14:20.603
Most likely the car was used
to transport the victim’s body
and then dumped.

14:20.694 --> 14:22.855
[Saroyan]
That does make more sense.
I found a—

14:22.946 --> 14:25.358
[Clears Throat]

14:25.449 --> 14:28.282
Excuse me.
The crack F.B.|. team...

14:28.368 --> 14:31.280
found a prescription bottle
of erythromycin.

14:31.371 --> 14:36.331
That’s not an animal drug.
That’s a macrolide antibiotic
used for a number of conditions.

14:36.418 --> 14:40.661
Including acne and S.T.D.’s.
Four boys.

14:40.756 --> 14:43.498
[Saroyan]
Maybe we got lucky and the bad
guy dropped his prescription.

14:43.592 --> 14:45.799
The bottle reads
“Donald Timmons.”

14:45.886 --> 14:47.797
[Starret]
We should track him down.

14:47.888 --> 14:50.129
Wow. That is an absolutely
wonderful idea.

14:50.223 --> 14:52.600
That could only have sprung
from the time-tempered mind...

14:52.684 --> 14:56.347
of a man with your
We ’5 experience ripping off
unsuspecting car enthusiasts.

14:56.438 --> 15:00.431
I feel better.
You treat everyone like crap.

15:11.453 --> 15:15.366
Whoa. 1 oo/( at that pit, huh?
Muscles li/(e cantaloupes

15:15.457 --> 15:17.618
[Barking]

15:17.751 --> 15:20.493
Is that why
we’re not getting out?
No, it’s the country, Bones.

15:20.587 --> 15:24.546
- They got a different way of doing things.
- You’re afraid ofthe dog.

15:24.633 --> 15:28.717
No, I’m not. What you do
in the country is you sit
in your car and you wait.

15:28.804 --> 15:30.635
/t’s rural polite.

15:30.722 --> 15:33.555
- Parker had a nightmare.
- About severed fingers?

15:33.642 --> 15:36.304
No, it was a singing frog.

15:36.394 --> 15:38.931
I don’t see the connection,
but then I’m one of those people...

15:39.022 --> 15:42.139
who thinks if
you dream about a banana,
it’s probablyjust a banana.

15:42.234 --> 15:45.522
He’s acting up at school.
He’s talking back to his mom.
He’s not flushing the toilet.

15:45.612 --> 15:47.318
- He’s a boy.
- Okay, yeah, I get it.

15:47.405 --> 15:51.114
You saw a whole lady’s corpse
when you were a little girl,
and you were fine.

15:51.201 --> 15:56.321
Yes. Although, for some reason
that I do not understand,
I kept staging my own death—

15:56.414 --> 16:00.077
pretending that
/ drowned in the bathtub,
fa/(ing electrical shock.

16:00.168 --> 16:02.079
It really freaked my parents out.

16:02.170 --> 16:04.707
Once when Russ saw me hanging,
he had to go see the school psychologist.

16:04.798 --> 16:07.631
- But otherwise, you were fine.
- Yeah.

16:07.717 --> 16:09.878
Yeah, okay. Do you dream
about bananas a lot?

16:11.805 --> 16:14.638
Why?

16:14.724 --> 16:17.887
Can we get out
of the car now?
[ Barking Continues]

16:18.019 --> 16:19.805
[Man]
Qu/et.
Don Timmons?

16:19.896 --> 16:22.478
Why’d youse wait in the car?
Gladys wouldn’t hurt you.

16:22.566 --> 16:25.478
F.B.I. Special Agent Booth.
This here is my associate,
Dr. Brennan.

16:25.610 --> 16:29.228
Do you know Dr. Seth Elliot?
Sure, I do. Went to high school
with him. He’s my vet. Why?

16:29.322 --> 16:33.361
- He was murdered.
- Oh, man. Hey, Robbie.

16:33.451 --> 16:37.114
- Robbie!
- What’s up?

16:37.205 --> 16:39.617
Seth died.

16:39.708 --> 16:41.448
What happened?

16:41.543 --> 16:43.625
This is the FBI.
They say he got murdered.

16:43.712 --> 16:46.249
This is my boy, Robbie.
He used to work
for Seth part-time.

16:46.339 --> 16:49.706
Can you think ofa reason
why Dr. Elliot’s car
would be full ofblood?

16:49.801 --> 16:53.635
No. No, it’s not like
he ran an animal ambulance
or something.

16:53.722 --> 16:56.555
- You ever ride in his car,
Mr. Timmons?
- No, never. Why?

16:57.893 --> 16:59.884
Oh.

16:59.978 --> 17:02.139
When it’s bagged l/ke that,
it means it’s evidence, Dad

17:02.230 --> 17:05.063
- It’s not his. It’s mine.
- Robbie.

17:05.150 --> 17:08.187
Dad, it’s a murder investigation.
They don’t care about insurance.

17:08.278 --> 17:09.859
I’m too old to be
on my dad’s insurance.

17:09.946 --> 17:13.234
- He got the prescription
under your name.
- But that’s fraud.

17:13.325 --> 17:15.816
That’s working around a system
that doesn’t care about
people like us.

17:15.911 --> 17:18.778
Listen, /’m the father.
Robbie shou/dn ’t be held
responsible.

17:18.872 --> 17:21.739
How about you? You been
in Dr. Elliot’s car recently?

17:21.833 --> 17:25.417
Last time was on the weekend.
We did a gelding over
at Danny Oliver’s place.

17:25.503 --> 17:27.585
What about Tuesday night?
Where were you?

17:27.672 --> 17:30.334
I was at my tutor’s.
I’m trying to get my G.E.D.

17:30.467 --> 17:32.458
[Toy Squeaking]
Hi.

17:32.552 --> 17:35.385
Robbie’s gonna go to medical school
ifit kills both of us.

17:35.472 --> 17:37.554
/ was kind of thinking
/’d be a vet.

17:37.641 --> 17:40.428
That’s a good backup if
you crap out on medical school.

17:40.518 --> 17:42.554
We ’re gonna need the tutor’s
name, address— all that stuﬂ.r

17:42.646 --> 17:44.887
It’s Andrew Hopp.
He’ll vouch for Robbie.

17:44.981 --> 17:48.724
- Gladys is a very nice animal.
- Yeah, Dad really trained ’em great.

17:48.818 --> 17:51.070
Gladys, come.
[Snaps Fingers]

17:51.154 --> 17:54.817
Sit. Lay down.

17:54.908 --> 17:58.571
- What?
- [Barking]

17:58.662 --> 18:02.655
- Wow. That’s impressive.
- No sense in owning a dog
ifyou can’t control it.

18:02.749 --> 18:05.832
- Gladys’s teeth are not filed.
- What?

18:05.919 --> 18:08.501
- [ ToySqueaks]
- Dr. Elliot was killed by
a dog with sharpened teeth.

18:08.588 --> 18:11.000
- Bones, what are you doing?
Enough playing with the dog.
- What?

18:11.091 --> 18:13.423
Seth was murdered by a dog?

18:13.510 --> 18:17.674
The murderer was a human being.
The murder weapon was a dog.

18:28.525 --> 18:32.143
We’re back to this, are we—
you staring at me?

18:32.279 --> 18:36.113
Well, I have concerns,
Dr. Hodgins.
About me?

18:36.199 --> 18:41.034
Yeah. You seem to have
completely abandoned your
paranoid conspiracy theories.

18:41.121 --> 18:44.158
I’m not a trained psychologist,
like you,

18:44.249 --> 18:46.365
but that sounds like a good thing.

18:46.459 --> 18:50.498
Dr. Saroyan, I found something
important I need to show you.

18:53.675 --> 18:56.792
around which you organized
your sense of self.

18:56.886 --> 18:59.502
Also, I can’t help but note
that you’re not paying quite
so much attention...

18:59.597 --> 19:01.508
to your personal appearance.

19:01.599 --> 19:05.467
Less paranoid and less vain.
Again, that sounds like a good thing.

19:05.562 --> 19:07.803
These kind ofchanges
in a man’s life...

19:07.897 --> 19:10.764
indicate intense distress.

19:10.859 --> 19:13.100
Would you like to
discuss this with me?

19:13.194 --> 19:15.936
I’d rather drive a motorcycle
full speed into a bridge abutment.

19:17.907 --> 19:22.196
Do you, uh— Do you
often entertain
suicidal thoughts?

19:22.287 --> 19:25.029
No. I’m more homicidal
in nature.

19:25.123 --> 19:27.455
Pretty sure you’re not
saying that in earnest,

19:27.542 --> 19:29.703
but as a way to keep me
at arm’s length.

19:29.836 --> 19:32.999
I’m here. What’s up?
Oh. Do you mind?

19:33.131 --> 19:36.669
I have work to do.
You need to talk about
these things, Dr. Hodgins.

19:36.760 --> 19:38.921
Ifnot with me,
then with someone else.

19:39.012 --> 19:41.094
Dr. Saroyan.

19:43.141 --> 19:45.223
What have you got?
Oh.

19:45.310 --> 19:49.553
Uh, I found some particulates
that the geniuses at
F.B.I. Forensics missed.

19:49.647 --> 19:54.937
- From the victim’s car?
- Crushed exoskeletons of
copepods and other crustaceans.

19:55.028 --> 19:58.520
- Ah.
- Yeah, I don’t know
what it means either.

19:58.615 --> 20:01.573
- So you called me over here to—
- Make Sweets go away.

20:01.659 --> 20:05.243
Not an appropriate use
ofyour boss, Dr. Hodgins.

20:05.330 --> 20:07.662
Well, it worked.
Didn’t it?

20:07.749 --> 20:10.741
Thanks for com/ng in
to the jeffersonian,
Dr. Hopp.

20:10.835 --> 20:13.326
I’m not a doctor yet.
I’m only a third-year
medical student.

20:13.421 --> 20:15.036
So you tutor Robbie Timmons?

20:15.131 --> 20:17.588
Twice a week.
Here’s a complete record
ofour meetings.

20:17.675 --> 20:20.838
I’ll take that. Thanks.
So you do a little
needlepoint on the side?

20:20.929 --> 20:23.671
It’s used to practice suturing

20:23.765 --> 20:27.428
- Next year, we use actual corpses.
- So, what is Robbie like?

20:27.519 --> 20:30.602
He’s a good kid.
He’s never gonna be what his
dad wants, but he tries hard.

20:30.688 --> 20:32.519
[Alarm Beeps]
Oh!

20:32.607 --> 20:35.849
I’m sorry. I have to run.
I got a class.

20:35.944 --> 20:37.855
Did you ever meet
Dr. Elliot?

20:37.946 --> 20:42.235
The vet that Robbie worked for?
The one who got murdered?
Yeah, yeah.

20:42.325 --> 20:44.236
Take it you didn’t
like him, huh?

20:44.327 --> 20:46.864
I was raised
not to speak ill
ofthe dead.

20:46.955 --> 20:49.571
I was raised to ask questions
like that, so I’m afraid
I’m gonna have to insist.

20:49.666 --> 20:54.285
[Sighs]
I met him maybe twice, and I’m
pretty sure he was tweaking.

20:54.421 --> 20:56.503
What’s that?
He was a meth addict.

20:56.589 --> 21:00.832
I’mjust not sure
Seth Elliot was the best
role model for Robbie Timmons.

21:00.969 --> 21:03.756
Did Robbie Timmons’s
father know?
No way.

21:03.847 --> 21:06.805
Old Don’s a pretty straight arrow.
And Robbie’s his main project.

21:06.891 --> 21:11.635
- Thanks for coming in.
- Thanks for letting me see
this place. It’s legendary.

21:11.729 --> 21:13.640
[Booth]
/t’s dogﬁghting

21:13.731 --> 21:16.689
[Ange/a ] / hate this job,
so I’m quitting to go run
a gallery in Dubai

21:16.776 --> 21:18.892
It’sjust disgusting.
Yeah.

21:18.987 --> 21:23.196
We got the subpoena
to download Dr. Elliot’s
P.D.A. records from the server.

21:23.324 --> 21:28.364
These were on his P.D.A.?
Time-stamped
the day of his death.

21:28.455 --> 21:30.662
Fighting pit.
Spectators.

21:30.748 --> 21:33.911
A rape stand used to
restrain uncooperative
females.

21:34.002 --> 21:37.165
The smaller cages
are for bait—

21:37.255 --> 21:40.167
small animals used
as re wards for the Winners.

21:40.258 --> 21:42.294
They teach you that
at anthropology school?

21:42.385 --> 21:46.549
Pitting animals against
each other is a common
pastime in evolving cultures...

21:46.639 --> 21:50.223
where violence is more
commonplace and animal life
has no value.

21:50.310 --> 21:52.722
To men.
No value to men.

21:52.812 --> 21:55.144
Yes. It’s always men.

21:55.231 --> 21:59.895
Here we go again.
Okay, you two, don’t get all
Xena, Princess Warrior on me.

21:59.986 --> 22:03.399
Okay? / guess we knownow
where Elliot l/ked to do his gambling

22:03.490 --> 22:06.527
Wait, Ange. Go back.

22:06.618 --> 22:09.075
There.
Can you magnify that?

22:09.162 --> 22:12.780
- What? That blob?
- There ’s something lam/"har—

22:14.000 --> 22:15.865
[Brennan]
/t’s Gladys’s ball.

22:16.002 --> 22:18.084
Who’s Gladys?
Could be enough for me
to get a warrant...

22:18.171 --> 22:20.753
ifthejudge had a glass
ofwine or two at lunch.

Hi, Parker.
I’m Dr. Sweets.

Okay. He’s having nightmares.
He’s not eating.

He doesn’t wanna go to school.
And suddenly he’s afraid of meteors.

Parker, that is exactly
what I am.

Gladys’s ball isn’t enough
for a warrant.

23:30.785 --> 23:33.822
Why?
Because over two million
ofthem were sold last year.

We need evidence that
the Timmons’s place
is used for dogfighting.

All right. Well, I found
crustaceous material
in the victim’s car.

23:43.006 --> 23:44.997
It’s an antifungal treatment
used on Astroturf.

23:45.133 --> 23:49.046

back up and they send them out

35:03.894 --> 35:07.102
- Is that that guy from TV
who talks to dogs?
- Yes.

35:07.189 --> 35:10.306
We wanna know who sicced Ripley
here on Seth Elliot.

35:10.401 --> 35:13.268
We don’t need you.
We know you were
in Chicago.

35:13.362 --> 35:16.320
Would you m/nd clapping
l/ke this?

35:16.407 --> 35:19.194
- No, we won’t do that.
- [ Mr. Timmons ] Do it, Robbie.

35:19.285 --> 35:21.742
- What?
- You’re not his master. Do it.

35:25.040 --> 35:27.031
It’s not him.

35:28.711 --> 35:31.453
[Barking]

35:33.799 --> 35:36.040
Look at that.

35:36.135 --> 35:38.547
He’s waiting
for your command.

35:38.637 --> 35:41.845
Maybe my dog killed
Dr. Elliot, but that doesn’t
mean I made him do it.

35:41.932 --> 35:46.050
R/p/ey’s a good dog.
He wou/dn ’t attack
unless he was ordered

35:48.105 --> 35:50.187
Tell these people
what you know
about Seth Elliot.

35:51.650 --> 35:53.891
Robbie.

35:58.949 --> 36:01.531
I saw it.

36:01.618 --> 36:05.156
And he told R/ple y to attack
because he saw Dr. Elliot
taking pictures...

36:05.247 --> 36:08.739
of the dogﬁghting

36:19.511 --> 36:21.422
I don’t know
how to do this.

36:21.513 --> 36:23.424
Mostly youjust tell me
what’s on your mind.

36:23.515 --> 36:25.927
Mostly on my mind
is I hate everyone.

36:26.018 --> 36:28.475
- Everyone?
- To varying degrees.

36:28.562 --> 36:31.474
But, um, yeah,
yeah, everyone.

36:34.943 --> 36:37.525
Angela... the most.

36:37.613 --> 36:40.776
Because we, you know,
had someth/ng great and uh—

36:40.908 --> 36:44.150
and now it’s dirt.
Hmm.

36:44.244 --> 36:48.658
Zack for being
such an idiot.

36:48.749 --> 36:50.660
Brennan for bringing us
all together.

36:50.751 --> 36:55.211
Cam for making us efficient.
Booth for giving us a mission.

36:55.297 --> 36:58.039
You for pick, pick,
picking at me.

36:58.175 --> 37:00.757
Should / go on?
No, no, I get the point.

37:01.762 --> 37:03.673
Ijust hate everyone.

37:03.764 --> 37:05.755
So, what?

37:05.849 --> 37:07.885
Intense therapy?
Heavy medication?

37:07.976 --> 37:10.183
Nah. I’m good with the hate.

37:12.022 --> 37:15.310
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, I am. You’re doing fine.

37:16.485 --> 37:19.352
Um, I hate everyone.

37:19.446 --> 37:22.609
You’re coping.
It’s a coping technique.
Coping’s good.

37:22.699 --> 37:25.941
Did you get your degree
on the Internet?
Let me see your diploma.

37:26.036 --> 37:28.778
You’re working.
You’re living a life of purpose.

37:28.914 --> 37:32.406
You haven’t turned your back
on your friends.
Except I hate them all.

37:32.501 --> 37:34.412
You’re independently
wealthy, right?

37:34.503 --> 37:39.213
You don’t have to work.
And yet you choose to stay
with the people you hate.

37:39.299 --> 37:42.507
Which makes me
completely nuts.

37:42.594 --> 37:46.462
No, you’ve replaced one way
of seeing the world— paranoia—

37:46.557 --> 37:48.548
with another— misanthropy.

37:48.642 --> 37:51.930
Soon, you’ll replace misanthropy
with something “nicer.”

37:52.020 --> 37:57.105
But for now, temporarily,
I’m satisfied with
your coping technique.

37:57.192 --> 38:00.684
My coping technique of hate?

38:00.779 --> 38:02.519
Correct.

38:07.536 --> 38:11.324
So, are you, like,
my therapist now or—

38:11.415 --> 38:15.374
- No, we work together.
- Great. See you at work.

38:16.420 --> 38:19.708
[Door Opens, Closes]
[ Chuckles ]

38:19.840 --> 38:21.876
Hey.
Hey

38:21.967 --> 38:25.960
Robbie Timmons gave a statement.
Andrew Hopp set the dog on Seth Elliot.

38:26.054 --> 38:29.046
Apparently, Elliot was furious
when he found out...

38:29.141 --> 38:31.553
the dog he’d given to Timmons
was used in dogfighting.

38:31.643 --> 38:34.635
Dr. Elliot took all those photos
to turn in to the police.

38:34.730 --> 38:36.971
Andrew Hopp would have lost
his main source ofincome.

38:37.065 --> 38:39.226
He would have been forced
to leave medical school.

38:39.318 --> 38:41.309
What about the rest
ofthe people in
the dogfighting ring?

38:41.403 --> 38:43.769
Don’t worry about it.
We’ll round ’em up.

38:43.906 --> 38:47.364
So, what do you got there?
Well, I’ve decided
to adopt Ripley.

38:47.451 --> 38:50.488
- Bones.
- I’ve already contacted
a doggy day care place...

38:50.579 --> 38:52.911
and my dad will take him
when I leave town.

38:52.998 --> 38:56.365
I got a little tag. See?
Ripley Brennan.

38:56.460 --> 38:58.951
He was put down.

38:59.046 --> 39:00.957
What?

39:01.048 --> 39:04.666
I’m sorry. He killed someone,
and they had to put him down.

39:04.760 --> 39:07.877
It wasn’t Ripley’s fault.
People made him do what he did.

39:07.971 --> 39:12.715
- I know. I’m sorry.
- You can tell he’s a good-natured dog.

39:12.809 --> 39:16.222
- They put him down?
- Yeah.

39:16.313 --> 39:18.395
Damn it!
[Sighs]

39:18.482 --> 39:20.473
Bones, I’m sorry.

39:20.567 --> 39:24.105
[Exhales]
What are they gonna do
with his remains?

39:29.868 --> 39:32.860
Hey, Booth,
can /do that?

39:32.955 --> 39:36.698
You sure?
Yeah, you dug it.

39:36.792 --> 39:38.783
[Sighs]
Yeah.

39:43.131 --> 39:45.508
So, did Sweets
help you with Parker?

39:45.592 --> 39:49.084
Yeah. I told Parker that’s it’s, uh,

39:49.179 --> 39:51.215
bestjust to walk away sometimes.

39:51.306 --> 39:54.890
Sometimes?
Isn’t it always better
to walk away?

39:54.977 --> 39:58.344
You know,
this dog would still be alive
if he wasn’t forced to fight.

39:58.438 --> 40:00.599
I told him to walk away
if it’s for himself...

40:00.691 --> 40:03.433
and to stand up and fight
ifit’s for someone else.

40:03.527 --> 40:07.315
/ don ’t know ifthat was
the nght th/ng to say, but—

40:07.406 --> 40:10.113
You’re a very good father.

40:14.162 --> 40:15.993
So, do you wanna say something?

40:24.298 --> 40:26.505
It’s not my fault. Bones,
why are you talking to me?

40:26.592 --> 40:31.211
- You’re the only one here.
- Talk to the universe
or God or Ripley.

40:31.305 --> 40:34.843
- I don’t believe in God.
- God spelled backwards is “dog.”

40:37.352 --> 40:40.185
And Ripley is dead.
Plus, he’s a dog...

40:40.272 --> 40:43.059
with, you know,
limited vocabulary skills.

40:43.150 --> 40:44.686
Bones, just...

40:46.236 --> 40:48.397
speak from your heart.

40:55.954 --> 40:59.867
On behalf of humankind,
Universe,

40:59.958 --> 41:03.496
I’d like to apologize
for what happened to Ripley.

41:03.587 --> 41:07.546
He was born a cute
little puppy.

41:07.633 --> 41:09.794
And then the people
who adopted him
wanted to kill him...

41:09.885 --> 41:15.175
because they were too stupid
to realize that he would
grow into a big dog.

41:15.265 --> 41:16.846
That’s good.

41:23.023 --> 41:25.389
Ripley was a good dog.

41:25.484 --> 41:27.896
He didn’t wanna ﬁght.

41:27.986 --> 41:31.149
But he did it
to please his master.

41:31.239 --> 41:33.901
He didn’t want to
attack a human being,

41:33.992 --> 41:36.950
but he did it
to please his master.

41:37.037 --> 41:42.907
It wasn’t Ripley’s fault
that his master was cruel
and selfish.

41:45.170 --> 41:49.083
Like all dogs, Ripley
only saw the good in people.

41:50.592 --> 41:54.084
Dogs are like that.
People should take a lesson.

41:54.179 --> 41:59.799
[Woman]
,r / hurt too ,r

41:59.893 --> 42:05.388
,r/ hurt tooJ

42:05.482 --> 42:07.598
Is that enough?
Yeah.

42:07.693 --> 42:12.232
As much as any good dog,
hey, could hope for,

42:12.322 --> 42:16.235
even with limited
vocabulary skills, okay?

42:16.326 --> 42:20.695
,r/ hurt tooJ

42:21.957 --> 42:25.870
,r / hurt too my

43:00.912 --> 43:02.322
What’s that mean?
