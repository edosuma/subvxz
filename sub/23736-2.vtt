00:29.130 --> 00:30.062
Uh...

00:30.064 --> 00:34.099
if you're trying to kill Hudson,
there's faster ways to do it.

00:34.101 --> 00:35.567
- I'm not trying to kill him--

00:35.569 --> 00:38.203
I'm trying to keep his
nasty cough from killing us.

00:38.205 --> 00:41.373
- Uhh, I'm having trouble
breathing in here.

00:41.375 --> 00:44.643

laughin' about?

00:58.225 --> 01:02.995
- Did Dub pull a cop's pants
down again or...?

01:02.997 --> 01:03.929
- Nah nah nah, we...

01:03.931 --> 01:06.999
we told Bunny that
we were all gonna race here,

01:07.001 --> 01:08.467
from my Dad's office.

01:08.469 --> 01:10.669
- So Bunny started running,
right, and he running,

01:10.671 --> 01:13.372
and we let him
get way ahead of us...

01:13.374 --> 01:14.506
- And then...

01:14.508 --> 01:17.042
my dad had his
helicopter come pick us up

01:17.044 --> 01:19.344
and drop us off
right down the street!

01:35.396 --> 01:39.164
- Hey, when did Hubbins
get his own office?

01:39.166 --> 01:40.165
- It's not an office.

01:40.167 --> 01:42.501
It's an anti-germ habitat.

01:42.503 --> 01:44.269
- Yes, Hudson's cough
won't go away,

01:44.271 --> 01:45.938
so Kenzie stuffed him
in a plastic tent.

01:45.940 --> 01:48.073
Now let's get
to that meeting ya!?

01:48.075 --> 01:49.475

in our midst....

01:55.116 --> 01:58.117
that needs to be cured.

01:59.420 --> 02:00.352
- No Dad, don't do it.

02:00.354 --> 02:03.555
- No no, I do believe
that this sick child

02:03.557 --> 02:08.127
needs a big, fat dose of
Doctor Dub's cough medication.

02:08.329 --> 02:11.997
- Dad, you're not a doctor!

02:11.999 --> 02:14.666
- I'ma write you
a prescription to shut up.

02:15.002 --> 02:18.270
- Kay, just a gentle reminder
that we got that meeting so...

02:18.272 --> 02:21.106
- Ruthless.
- Oh, he's talking more.

02:21.108 --> 02:22.541

to that supermarket,

02:22.543 --> 02:25.544
over in Chinatown,
and pick me up a few things.

02:25.546 --> 02:27.246

- Wow.
There's a lotta toys in here.

03:33.047 --> 03:34.479
- Yeah,
in a toy company like this

03:34.481 --> 03:36.815
you'd think there'd
be more bread.

03:37.351 --> 03:39.751
- Ya, you'd think
there'd be more bread.

03:42.423 --> 03:43.622

that's a good idea.

for good things.

smells pretty good.

See, your cough gets
cured when ya drink it.

04:51.525 --> 04:52.524
- Well, can I drink it now?

- No! I still need to add
the "ingredient esspess-see-al."

08:03.083 --> 08:05.183

- Why?

08:05.185 --> 08:08.553
- Because the toy business
is extremely competitive.

08:08.555 --> 08:11.189
- We can't let our ideas
be stolen.

08:11.191 --> 08:12.324
- Oh, well I mean I get that,

08:12.326 --> 08:15.360
but I think we could
do a much better job for you,

08:15.362 --> 08:17.195
you know, designing the game...
- Mhm.

08:17.197 --> 08:20.866
- if we could, y'know,
hold a Lumple.

08:20.868 --> 08:22.934
- No one gets to see a Lumple

08:22.936 --> 08:25.103
before the day of launching.

08:25.105 --> 08:27.205
- Except for her
daughter, Sophie.

08:27.207 --> 08:28.573
She's had one
for a month, right?

08:28.575 --> 08:33.278
'Bout a month?
Your daughter?

People love it.

09:34.207 --> 09:35.340
But, I can't
talk right now--

09:35.342 --> 09:37.509
I gotta go mix up some
of Doctor Dub's Gold Brew.

09:37.511 --> 09:40.045
- Huh?
- Dub's cure for my cough.

09:40.047 --> 09:41.012
- Oh right, kay but wait--

09:41.014 --> 09:42.480
did you find out anything
online about Lumples?

09:42.482 --> 09:45.250
- Oh yeah, I sent you a link
to an unboxing video.

09:45.252 --> 09:48.353
- An unbo--oh my god
that's great!

09:48.355 --> 09:51.523
Aww c'mon baby...
show me a Lumple...

09:51.525 --> 09:53.992
- Okay guys,
so, about three days ago,

09:53.994 --> 09:54.960
I got fired from PlayMo,

09:54.962 --> 09:58.296
But before I left,
I swiped one a'these bad boys.

09:58.298 --> 10:01.366
it's their new top secret toy,
called a Lumple.

10:01.368 --> 10:02.500
Now, let's get this box open

10:02.502 --> 10:05.003
so we can see
what a Lumple looks li--

10:05.005 --> 10:07.138
No, don't! Ahh!
How'd you find me?!?

- Hey hey!

10:17.150 --> 10:19.551
- Hello.

10:19.553 --> 10:20.619
- Guess who stayed up all night

10:20.621 --> 10:23.521
making a beta version
of the Lumple game?

10:23.523 --> 10:26.324
- Wha--no way that's so...

10:26.326 --> 10:27.425
Wait, how'd you make the game

10:27.427 --> 10:29.327
when we don't even know
what a Lumple looks like?

10:29.329 --> 10:31.329
- I used my imagination.

10:31.331 --> 10:33.598
- Oh nooo.

10:33.600 --> 10:36.534
- Check it out, here.

10:36.770 --> 10:39.004
- Ewww, what is this
big hairy pimple?

10:39.006 --> 10:42.273
- A creature--
it represents a Lumple.

10:42.275 --> 10:44.075
- Ohhh no...

10:44.077 --> 10:45.076
- We can change it later,

10:45.078 --> 10:47.012
once we find out
what a Lumple looks like.

10:47.014 --> 10:48.413
- Then what's the point
of even making this?

10:48.415 --> 10:52.384
- We promised that PlayMo lady
we'd have a game demo by today.

10:52.386 --> 10:55.086
- Well, ya can't make
a game based on Lumples

- Each of you may put your hands
into the box-holes,

the Lumple, by touch only.
