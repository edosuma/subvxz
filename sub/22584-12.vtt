00:12.843 --> 00:19.855
[groans]

00:23.439 --> 00:25.089
Bridge to Engineering.

00:26.206 --> 00:27.806
Engineering, respond!

00:37.431 --> 00:42.731
This is the warship Kumari calling Imperial Command.
We've been attacked by a Tellarite vessel!

00:43.002 --> 00:46.002
Primary systems have failed!
Request immediate...

00:47.668 --> 00:48.518
Alert.

00:48.734 --> 00:51.234
Warp containment breach
in two minutes.

00:52.362 --> 00:53.983
Tellarite swine!

00:54.910 --> 00:56.510
They'll pay for this.

00:58.926 --> 01:00.176
This is Shran.

01:00.572 --> 01:02.522
All crew to the escape pods!

01:03.803 --> 01:05.003
Abandon ship.

01:08.702 --> 01:10.863
<i>It's been a long road</i>

01:13.133 --> 01:15.338
<i>Getting from there to here</i>

01:16.111 --> 01:18.384
<i>It's been a long time</i>

01:20.056 --> 01:22.996
<i>But my time is finally near</i>

01:23.878 --> 01:27.458
<i>And I will see my dream
come alive at last</i>

01:28.455 --> 01:30.976
<i>I will touch the sky</i>

01:31.654 --> 01:35.269
<i>And they're not gonna
hold me down no more</i>

01:35.367 --> 01:38.263
<i>No, they're not gonna
change my mind</i>

01:38.657 --> 01:42.877
<i>'Cause I've got faith
of the heart</i>

01:43.592 --> 01:46.339
<i>I'm going where my heart
will take me</i>

01:46.425 --> 01:50.690
<i>I've got faith to believe</i>

01:51.407 --> 01:53.792
<i>I can do anything</i>

01:54.204 --> 01:58.252
<i>I've got strength of the soul</i>

01:59.011 --> 02:01.695
<i>No one's gonna bend
or break me</i>

02:01.963 --> 02:05.479
<i>I can reach any star</i>

02:07.813 --> 02:11.208
<i>I've got faith</i>
<i>I've got, I've got</i>

02:11.371 --> 02:14.076
<i>I've got faith</i>

02:15.413 --> 02:17.913
<i>Faith of the heart.</i>

02:30.517 --> 02:35.917
The food on this ship isn't fit for animals!
That mangy pet of yours would probably taste better.

02:36.148 --> 02:39.400
You can either take me home or find a new chef--
it's that simple.

02:39.400 --> 02:42.935
Oh, something else: I want new quarters.
Is that so.

02:43.275 --> 02:47.692
For one thing, my room is too small;
there are plasma conduits running across the ceiling.

02:47.692 --> 02:50.092
It's noisy!
It keeps me up all night.

02:50.164 --> 02:53.079
Maybe you'd sleep better in the cargo bay.
What did you say to me?

02:53.079 --> 02:55.358
This is a starship, not a luxury liner.

02:55.410 --> 02:59.098
If you're not satisfied with the accommodations,
we can leave you behind in a shuttlepod.

02:59.098 --> 03:01.410
Maybe you'll have better luck
with whoever picks you up!

03:01.410 --> 03:04.347
And if you don't like Chef's food,
don't eat it.

03:05.465 --> 03:10.415
From the looks of things, you should probably
skip the dessert table while you're at it!

03:14.805 --> 03:16.955
That was a nice touch.
[sighs]

03:16.958 --> 03:18.108
[laughing]

03:18.145 --> 03:24.598
I can't believe I'm supposed to speak to their ambassador like that.
Tellarites always have a litany of complaints.

03:24.598 --> 03:26.797
It's how they start arguments
with people they've just met.

03:26.797 --> 03:31.497
Even if they have nothing to complain about?
In that case, they'll just insult you.

03:31.735 --> 03:36.965
Whatever they say, you have to respond in kind.
Otherwise, they'll take offense. [wry laugh]

03:36.965 --> 03:39.665
A species that actually thrives on arguing.

03:40.603 --> 03:42.953
They probably make good politicians.

03:43.169 --> 03:45.219
Thanks for the dry run.
Sir...

03:46.324 --> 03:48.424
I wasn't kidding about Porthos.

03:50.111 --> 03:51.527
You think he's mangy?

03:51.527 --> 03:54.853
No... but you might want to keep him out of sight.

03:54.853 --> 03:59.142
Tellarites consider canines
something of a, uh... delicacy.

04:07.707 --> 04:10.358
Captain's Starlog, November 12, 2154.

04:11.141 --> 04:15.887
We've arrived in orbit of Tellar Prime.
Starfleet's ordered us to transport their ambassador

04:15.887 --> 04:18.536
to a neutral planet designated as "Babel,"

04:18.987 --> 04:25.591
where Earth mediators will try to settle a long-standing trade dispute
between the Tellarites and the Andorians.

04:26.086 --> 04:29.036
Everything ready for our guests?
Oh, just about.

04:29.041 --> 04:34.291
But my people are working triple shifts
trying to finish that mud bath they wanted. Mud bath?!

04:35.005 --> 04:38.555
Apparently, the ambassador
likes a good soak in the morning.

04:39.469 --> 04:41.519
Something I don't understand--

04:41.584 --> 04:45.235
these Tellarites have warp ships,
so why do we have to take them to the conference?

04:45.235 --> 04:47.720
Babel's on the far side of Andorian space.

04:47.720 --> 04:51.375
They won't allow Tellarite ships
to pass through their territory.

04:52.349 --> 04:54.299
Now we're a shuttle service.

04:54.647 --> 04:59.058
When are we going to get back to exploring?
This trade dispute is a little more urgent.

04:59.058 --> 05:02.508
It could turn into a shooting war,
if the conference fails.

05:38.950 --> 05:41.650
You people are even uglier
than I remember.

05:42.589 --> 05:45.139
Captain Jonathan Archer.
Welcome aboard.

05:47.052 --> 05:48.402
Ambassador Gral.

05:58.070 --> 05:59.120
[grunts]

06:04.346 --> 06:07.336
I'm told this ship is the pride of Starfleet.

06:09.127 --> 06:11.327
I find it small and unimpressive.

06:12.062 --> 06:13.012
Funny...

06:13.546 --> 06:16.296
I was about to say the same thing
about you.

06:20.228 --> 06:23.048
[laughing]

06:23.848 --> 06:25.998
You may show us to our quarters.

06:30.657 --> 06:35.107
It's far too cold in here.
We're expected to stay on this ship for five days?!

06:42.310 --> 06:45.910
[laughs]
So he says, "Well, I'm not really a pilot."

06:46.387 --> 06:47.437
[laughs]

06:48.072 --> 06:49.672
Ah, you don't get it.

06:59.803 --> 07:00.953
Warm enough?

07:00.954 --> 07:04.554
The ambassador requested the temperature be increased.
Again?

07:05.779 --> 07:10.579
Yeah, I like these people more than I thought I would.
They don't hold anything back.

07:11.167 --> 07:14.167
It's refreshing, speaking your mind for a change.

07:15.213 --> 07:18.713
You don't feel free to speak
your mind with the rest of us?

07:18.726 --> 07:22.726
Oh, you know what I mean.
No... maybe you'd like to explain it to me.

07:25.033 --> 07:28.783
Why don't you change your uniform
before you stink up the place.

07:30.924 --> 07:32.974
Ah, practicing your Tellarite.

07:33.319 --> 07:34.319
I get it.

07:44.166 --> 07:45.466
When in Rome...

07:45.579 --> 07:47.029
I beg your pardon?

07:47.981 --> 07:49.031
Forget it.

07:49.652 --> 07:52.152
The ambassador wants to speak with you.

07:52.760 --> 07:54.110
What a surprise.

08:01.544 --> 08:03.894
Have we crossed into Andorian space?

08:04.078 --> 08:05.528
A few minutes ago.

08:07.625 --> 08:11.765
The last time I was here,
I was on the command deck of one of our cruisers...

08:11.765 --> 08:15.008
driving those blue demons
back into their territory.

08:17.957 --> 08:21.257
The Andorians came to your aid
during the Xindi crisis.

08:21.670 --> 08:23.553
They helped save my planet.

08:23.553 --> 08:26.854
So why should we trust humans
to mediate this dispute?

08:27.272 --> 08:31.772
You owe them your lives.
Earth wants a peaceful outcome just as much as you do.

08:32.236 --> 08:37.294
That isn't going to happen if we choose sides.
Your people have no experience in interstellar affairs!

08:37.294 --> 08:40.426
It doesn't seem
that you have a lot of other options.

08:51.692 --> 08:57.116
Your chef obviously went to a great deal of trouble.
I'm told these are authentic Tellarite dishes.

08:57.116 --> 08:57.866
Hmm!

08:58.426 --> 09:01.876
If I'd wanted to eat like this,
I would've stayed at home!

09:02.509 --> 09:05.859
I was expecting to sample
Earth cuisine on this journey.

09:06.340 --> 09:08.690
I'll have him whip something up.
Ah!

09:09.455 --> 09:12.155
[com beeps]
Captain Archer to the bridge.

09:18.632 --> 09:21.632
We've picked up a message
on an Andorian channel.

09:21.776 --> 09:25.026
... mari calling Imperial Command.
We've been attacked

09:26.559 --> 09:29.309
...systems have failed!
Request immediate...

09:30.417 --> 09:31.467
That's it.

09:31.661 --> 09:33.811
They have no ships within range.

09:34.205 --> 09:36.905
How long to intercept them
at maximum warp?

09:36.927 --> 09:37.977
Two hours.

09:41.277 --> 09:42.477
Alter course.

09:43.230 --> 09:46.530
Contact Babel. Let them know
we're going to be delayed.

09:51.902 --> 09:55.552
Judging by the debris pattern,
I'd say their reactor breached.

09:55.565 --> 09:58.865
I'm detecting significant quantities
of duranium alloy.

10:00.554 --> 10:03.454
This was most likely an Andorian combat vessel.

10:09.166 --> 10:11.316
Escape pods.
Multiple bio-signs.

10:13.784 --> 10:15.884
Bring them into the launch bay.

10:16.408 --> 10:18.858
Tell Phlox to stand by for casualties.

10:19.516 --> 10:22.666
This would be easier
if you'd take a few steps back.

10:23.533 --> 10:26.183
I hope you've studied Andorian physiology.

10:26.288 --> 10:27.638
[door opening]

10:31.397 --> 10:33.697
How many of my crew did you rescue?

10:34.349 --> 10:35.349
Nineteen.

10:41.147 --> 10:43.075
Our complement was 86.

10:44.266 --> 10:47.516
Your distress call said you were attacked.
Tellarites.

10:49.652 --> 10:54.060
We were escorting our ambassador
to the trade conference when they dropped out of warp.

10:54.060 --> 10:58.978
The ambassador's ship was destroyed in seconds;
the Tellarites crippled us with their next shot.

10:58.978 --> 11:04.479
I've never seen one of their vessels
maneuver like this one.

11:05.850 --> 11:11.200
While those barbarians have been talking peace,
they've obviously been improving their warships.

11:11.411 --> 11:17.088
Why would the Tellarites agree to let Earth
mediate your dispute if they were planning this strike?

11:17.088 --> 11:19.015
Perhaps you should ask them.

11:19.831 --> 11:24.681
I suggest you scan for our data recorder.
It'll contain the sensor logs of the attack.

11:29.610 --> 11:32.610
We seem to keep running
into each other, Captain.

11:33.018 --> 11:35.518
It's fortunate Enterprise was close by.

11:35.551 --> 11:37.251
It's not a coincidence.

11:38.341 --> 11:40.891
We're carrying the Tellarite delegation.

11:41.805 --> 11:43.605
They're aboard this ship?

11:43.685 --> 11:47.435
These aren't the people who attacked you.
They may know who did.

11:48.781 --> 11:49.631
Shran!

11:54.767 --> 11:56.217
You're on my ship.

11:59.359 --> 12:05.740
You better keep them away from us,
or there will be bloodshed.

12:17.336 --> 12:22.261
I've analyzed these hull fragments.
The damage is consistent with Tellarite particle cannons.

12:22.261 --> 12:23.677
What about the black box?

12:23.677 --> 12:29.582
The memory core was damaged, but I was able
to reconstruct the last few seconds of sensor data.

12:38.785 --> 12:39.885
Tellarites.

12:42.708 --> 12:45.872
Set course for Andoria,
best speed.

12:46.113 --> 12:48.113
These accusations are absurd.

12:48.811 --> 12:51.661
We had nothing to do
with this alleged attack.

12:54.806 --> 12:56.706
The Andorian sensor logs...

12:57.199 --> 13:00.149
look them over yourself.
Logs can be fabricated.

13:00.806 --> 13:02.606
You saw the debris field.

13:02.855 --> 13:06.005
For all we know,
they destroyed the ship themselves.

13:06.293 --> 13:09.193
Andorian technology
is more advanced than ours.

13:09.601 --> 13:12.499
One of our cruisers wouldn't stand a chance
against two of theirs!

13:12.499 --> 13:14.607
I want you to speak to your people.

13:14.680 --> 13:19.021
Find out what you can.
I am not comfortable with so many Andorians aboard.

13:20.069 --> 13:23.819
Contact your superiors.
Have them transferred to another vessel.

13:23.962 --> 13:26.062
Let's get something straight...

13:26.075 --> 13:29.325
you're just a passenger on my ship.
I give the orders.

13:29.680 --> 13:32.930
Where are you taking them?
Back to Andoria. You can't!

13:33.655 --> 13:38.455
They'll arrest us. They'll hold us responsible
for this incident! If you're innocent,

13:38.898 --> 13:41.498
I'm sure you have nothing to worry about.

13:46.633 --> 13:47.883
To the Kumari.

13:55.105 --> 13:56.555
From what I saw...

13:58.070 --> 14:02.124
she was a fine ship with a good crew.
I was in command for 12 years.

14:03.823 --> 14:05.573
First ship of her class.

14:05.856 --> 14:10.156
Most of the crew I served with even longer.
They were more than colleagues.

14:10.393 --> 14:12.093
I knew their spouses...

14:12.646 --> 14:13.946
their children.

14:17.538 --> 14:19.488
I'm grateful Talas survived.

14:20.300 --> 14:21.750
If I'd lost her...

14:22.895 --> 14:26.895
I didn't realize there was something going on
between the two of you.

14:26.990 --> 14:28.840
It's a recent development.

14:29.055 --> 14:33.344
In the past, I never would've considered a relationship
with someone under my command.

14:33.344 --> 14:34.544
What changed?

14:37.158 --> 14:40.717
Andorian women are far more aggressive
than Earth females.

14:41.350 --> 14:42.550
She made a...

14:43.267 --> 14:44.417
an overture.

14:45.722 --> 14:47.022
I had a choice:

14:47.907 --> 14:53.189
charge her with assaulting a superior...
or mate with her.

14:56.917 --> 14:59.217
I hope you made the right decision.

15:04.612 --> 15:10.012
I regret that you're drawn into another of our conflicts,
Captain. I seem to have a knack for it.

15:10.112 --> 15:12.839
I doubt that war can be avoided this time.

15:13.480 --> 15:16.630
When that sensor data
is seen by Imperial Command...

15:16.989 --> 15:18.639
It doesn't make sense.

15:19.126 --> 15:22.426
Why agree to a conference,
then attack your ambassador?

15:23.045 --> 15:25.601
Tellarites don't think like you or I do.

15:27.012 --> 15:31.129
They've been provoking us for months.
We've lost six freighters along the border.

15:31.129 --> 15:33.079
We know they're responsible.

15:33.264 --> 15:36.264
Tellarites claim they've lost ships of their own.

15:36.391 --> 15:38.641
You'd accept their word over ours?

15:39.875 --> 15:42.325
[com beeps]
T'Pol to Captain Archer.

15:44.580 --> 15:48.280
Go ahead.
There's a ship on an intercept course. It's Andorian.

15:55.874 --> 15:57.524
You expecting company?

16:00.350 --> 16:01.400
Hail them.

16:06.687 --> 16:09.044
They're not responding.
[beeping]

16:09.095 --> 16:12.145
I'm reading a power buildup.
They're opening fire!

16:20.739 --> 16:22.889
What in the hell are they doing?

16:23.590 --> 16:27.040
Our warp field's destabilizing.
We're dropping to impulse.

16:28.183 --> 16:29.433
Call them off.

16:29.452 --> 16:31.002
Let me talk to them.

16:31.512 --> 16:35.462
This is Commander Shran of the Imperial Guard.
Call off your attack!

16:37.105 --> 16:40.855
My crew is aboard this ship!
Do you hear me?! Abort your attack!

16:49.154 --> 16:51.054
Phase-cannons, return fire!

16:52.567 --> 16:53.617
No damage.

16:54.444 --> 16:57.194
We need to get through their shields...
how?

16:57.850 --> 17:01.300
They're going to kill all of us
if you don't do something!

17:04.943 --> 17:07.393
I need to access your targeting array.

17:13.194 --> 17:17.194
These are the coordinates to their shield generator.
Fire when ready.

17:20.185 --> 17:21.286
Direct hit.

17:23.648 --> 17:26.549
Their shields are still at maximum.
Impossible.

17:28.060 --> 17:29.061
Shran...!

17:31.270 --> 17:36.370
Our dorsal plating's almost gone. Starboard thrusters are down.
Torpedoes... maximum yield!

17:40.616 --> 17:41.716
[beeping]

17:42.497 --> 17:43.997
They're moving off.

17:44.370 --> 17:47.020
There's a fluctuation in their power grid.

17:48.931 --> 17:49.981
Good work.

17:50.045 --> 17:51.795
It wasn't my doing, sir.

17:52.346 --> 17:54.546
I didn't target their power grid.

17:56.414 --> 18:00.751
Your government asked us to be a part of a conference.
Now you're attacking us!

18:00.751 --> 18:02.684
This makes perfect sense, Captain.

18:03.082 --> 18:05.730
They sent a distress call
to lure you into a trap.

18:05.730 --> 18:10.532
We have no argument with Starfleet.
Your people tried to destroy this ship!

18:10.764 --> 18:12.414
Captain, I assure you,

18:12.426 --> 18:17.276
what happened does not represent the will or intent of my government.
Admit the truth.

18:17.524 --> 18:20.674
The Imperial Guard never wanted
this conference to take place.

18:20.674 --> 18:23.516
They've obviously taken matters
into their own hands.

18:23.516 --> 18:26.937
Are you implying
the Imperial Guard's been disloyal?

18:27.200 --> 18:30.900
I don't have to imply anything.
The facts speak for themselves.

18:34.446 --> 18:36.996
That may not have been an Andorian ship.

18:37.285 --> 18:41.085
What?
Its shield matrix had a completely different configuration.

18:41.156 --> 18:45.879
What is that supposed to prove?
Several of our warships have been reported missing over the years.

18:45.879 --> 18:50.799
The Tellarites could have taken one of them--
enhanced its systems. [laughs]

18:50.944 --> 18:55.514
He's suffering from paranoia, Captain.
I'm not paranoid. Your people are trying to kill us!

18:55.514 --> 18:57.514
I've had enough of your lies!

18:57.783 --> 18:59.033
That's enough!

19:01.895 --> 19:06.895
You want to fight, I'll throw both of you in the brig.
You can tear each other to pieces.

19:21.561 --> 19:24.361
What happened?
Archer claims to be impartial,

19:24.727 --> 19:28.077
but it's obvious he's inclined to believe the Andorians.

19:28.564 --> 19:34.014
We may have made a mistake in trusting these humans.
They've posted soldiers outside our quarters.

19:35.128 --> 19:37.128
We're prisoners on this ship.

19:37.965 --> 19:39.915
Have you stopped to consider

19:40.498 --> 19:44.516
Archer may be conspiring
with the Andorians?

19:48.785 --> 19:51.552
T'Pol's found something
you're going to want to see.

19:51.552 --> 19:54.304
We retrieved this
from your ship's data recorder.

19:55.905 --> 19:59.855
This is the power signature
of the vessel that destroyed the Kumari.

20:02.872 --> 20:06.872
This signature belongs to the Andorian ship
that attacked Enterprise.

20:10.896 --> 20:12.346
They're identical.

20:12.950 --> 20:14.600
That can't be correct.

20:16.171 --> 20:20.386
Examine the data yourself.
Your sensors are unsophisticated. There's been a mistake.

20:20.386 --> 20:23.536
We've confirmed the data.
What are you suggesting...

20:23.703 --> 20:26.753
that these two vessels are
actually the same ship?

20:27.263 --> 20:29.463
I don't know what I'm suggesting,

20:30.504 --> 20:32.804
but we need to keep our minds open.

20:33.416 --> 20:38.880
The Tellarites have violated every accord
we've made with them.

20:38.880 --> 20:40.361
They can't be trusted.

20:40.532 --> 20:44.382
Your desire for a peaceful resolution
is blinding you from the truth! Commander, perhaps...

20:44.382 --> 20:48.246
I've heard enough from you!
Vulcans are expert liars.

20:48.339 --> 20:52.967
Perhaps your people are behind this.
You're speaking to my First Officer. [com beeps]

20:52.967 --> 20:54.567
Tucker to the bridge.

20:58.218 --> 20:59.218
Go ahead.

20:59.478 --> 21:03.582
Warp engines will be on-line in ten minutes.
We'll have hull plating back within an hour.

21:03.582 --> 21:04.932
Keep me updated.

21:05.654 --> 21:09.104
We've located the warp trail
of the ship that attacked us.

21:10.467 --> 21:12.267
We're going to follow it.

21:12.603 --> 21:16.398
Some of my crew are in serious condition.
They need attention from our physicians.

21:16.398 --> 21:18.898
It'll take four days to get to Andoria.

21:19.338 --> 21:21.638
By then, that ship'll be long gone.

21:28.633 --> 21:30.733
Something wrong with your meal?

21:32.846 --> 21:34.196
Just not hungry.

21:40.018 --> 21:42.318
Do you think we're moving too fast?

21:43.689 --> 21:47.439
Commander Tucker believes
its safe to maintain this warp factor.

21:49.208 --> 21:50.958
That's not what I meant.

21:52.079 --> 21:55.379
Earth's got a lot riding
on the outcome of these talks.

21:56.128 --> 21:58.996
But I'm not sure we knew
what we were getting into.

21:58.996 --> 22:01.900
These people have been feuding
for over a century.

22:04.103 --> 22:07.203
Maybe we should've let your government handle this.

22:08.183 --> 22:13.083
Although our relations have improved recently,
it's clear the Andorians don't trust us.

22:16.824 --> 22:18.774
Aside from breathing oxygen,

22:19.206 --> 22:23.906
it doesn't seem to me that Andorians and Tellarites
have a hell of a lot in common.

22:24.324 --> 22:27.222
The same has been said about humans and Vulcans.

22:27.222 --> 22:30.612
Hoshi tells me you got a transmission
from Vulcan this morning.

22:32.774 --> 22:34.624
It was a personal message.

22:39.716 --> 22:41.116
It was from Koss.

22:41.923 --> 22:44.623
Our marriage has been officially dissolved.

22:45.907 --> 22:47.607
I'm sorry to hear that.

22:47.744 --> 22:51.994
You have nothing to apologize for.
[com beeps] Bridge to Captain Archer.

22:52.814 --> 22:55.614
I believe we've found the Andorian ship, sir.

22:56.516 --> 22:57.916
We're on our way.

23:08.843 --> 23:09.743
Report.

23:10.065 --> 23:14.728
I've been unable to locate the malfunction.
Then I suggest you double your efforts.

23:14.728 --> 23:18.628
This is enemy territory.
We can't remain here any longer without...

23:19.150 --> 23:22.208
[alarm sounds]

23:22.964 --> 23:24.964
There's a vessel approaching.

23:25.997 --> 23:26.947
Show me.

23:38.943 --> 23:44.143
You said you found the Andorians.
I don't understand it, sir. The warp trail ends right here.

23:45.474 --> 23:47.774
Their primary systems are off-line.

23:48.675 --> 23:49.725
Hail them.

23:54.367 --> 23:55.517
No response.

23:56.999 --> 23:58.949
Bio-signs are indeterminate.

23:59.965 --> 24:00.915
Magnify.

24:05.312 --> 24:07.312
Any idea what the spikes are?

24:07.837 --> 24:10.387
They appear to be subspace transceivers.

24:10.842 --> 24:15.542
Why would they need so many?
Their hull is also lined with multi-spectral emitters.

24:15.739 --> 24:18.489
For what purpose?
I prefer not to speculate.

24:21.525 --> 24:25.125
Find out who these people are.
Take a team of MACOs with you.

24:26.097 --> 24:30.547
Their life support's off-line. Bring Trip along.
See if he can get it working.

24:42.397 --> 24:45.047
You two start down there.
Yes, Lieutenant.

24:45.668 --> 24:47.968
This whole section's depressurized.

24:49.779 --> 24:52.829
Let's hope the rest of this ship isn't as cramped.

24:53.584 --> 24:56.434
I can't read anything
through these bulkheads.

24:57.824 --> 24:58.924
Stay alert!

25:02.583 --> 25:05.433
The propulsion matrix
still isn't functioning.

25:05.476 --> 25:06.826
How much longer?

25:07.033 --> 25:08.833
The repairs are underway.

25:11.371 --> 25:13.671
Prepare to overload the core.
What?

25:14.335 --> 25:16.785
If we can't repair the matrix in time,

25:16.864 --> 25:20.464
I'll do whatever is necessary
to keep it away from Starfleet.

25:29.041 --> 25:31.141
Tucker to Enterprise.
Go ahead.

25:31.728 --> 25:34.578
We haven't run into any welcoming parties yet.

25:36.138 --> 25:39.938
We've found a computer interface,
but there's no power over here.

25:39.949 --> 25:44.099
I'm going to need T'Pol's help to bring it on line.
Uplink your scanner.

25:49.460 --> 25:51.960
What's happening?
I didn't do anything.

25:52.766 --> 25:53.516
Sir.

26:05.156 --> 26:07.656
Evasive maneuvers.
Get our people back!

26:18.032 --> 26:23.082
Captain, we're ready to come home whenever you are!
They've reinforced their hull plating.

26:24.280 --> 26:28.180
We can only transport one at a time.
Take Carender and Myers first!

26:35.721 --> 26:37.621
One of the MACOs is aboard.

26:39.327 --> 26:42.427
They've hit our EPS couplings.
Switch to auxiliary.

26:43.766 --> 26:45.616
Target their weapons only.

26:54.482 --> 26:58.582
We're losing hull plating.
Transporter's off-line. Did we get everyone?

26:58.597 --> 26:59.897
Just the MACOs.

27:00.485 --> 27:04.935
T'Pol. The primary phase coil is fused.
It'll take several hours to repair it.

27:06.585 --> 27:09.085
Decompression on C-Deck,
section three.

27:09.468 --> 27:11.018
We have to withdraw.

27:13.478 --> 27:14.778
Archer to Trip.

27:15.002 --> 27:16.902
We've lost the transporter.

27:16.979 --> 27:18.079
Understood.

27:18.258 --> 27:20.658
Sit tight until we come back for you.

27:20.802 --> 27:22.302
We'll be fine, sir.

27:23.136 --> 27:25.036
Get us out of here, Travis.

27:25.385 --> 27:26.585
Maximum warp.

27:39.011 --> 27:41.311
They're retreating.
Pursuit course.

27:53.739 --> 27:54.539
Trip!

28:05.652 --> 28:07.652
You're down to eight minutes.

28:12.079 --> 28:14.670
[air hissing]

28:15.777 --> 28:17.777
[Reed sighs, gasps]
Thanks.

28:18.633 --> 28:22.064
But we're not going to get very far
only sharing your supply.

28:22.064 --> 28:24.583
I'll try to get their life support on line.
Right.

28:24.733 --> 28:27.583
With our luck,
they probably breathe fluorine.

28:30.886 --> 28:31.886
Warp 4.9.

28:33.572 --> 28:35.222
They're still closing.

28:36.305 --> 28:37.355
Warp five.

28:38.945 --> 28:40.795
They've matched our speed.

28:41.525 --> 28:44.175
Let's see what those new injectors can do.

28:46.248 --> 28:47.398
Warp 5.02...

28:49.092 --> 28:49.942
.04...

28:52.145 --> 28:53.045
5.06...

28:55.534 --> 28:57.234
They're falling behind.

28:59.641 --> 29:02.491
The injectors stabilized.
We're holding speed.

29:09.917 --> 29:11.567
Maintain your heading.

29:15.977 --> 29:18.727
You're going to wear out the deck plating...

29:18.949 --> 29:19.999
Commander.

29:21.991 --> 29:25.341
Gral knows more about
these attacks than he's admitting.

29:26.179 --> 29:28.079
How can Archer be so blind.

29:29.448 --> 29:32.208
We have no choice but to let him
deal with the situation.

29:32.208 --> 29:36.166
I'm not going to entrust the security of Andoria
to the pinkskins or anyone else.

29:36.166 --> 29:38.506
We trusted the Tellarites once.

29:38.506 --> 29:40.656
I won't make that mistake again.

29:44.599 --> 29:49.922
With the appropriate persuasion,
Gral will talk.

29:50.502 --> 29:53.702
I doubt Archer's capable
of a thorough interrogation.

29:54.043 --> 29:56.493
Then I'll have to question him myself.

29:57.217 --> 30:02.167
There are guards outside our quarters.
We don't even know what deck the ambassador's on.

30:02.716 --> 30:05.266
Can you bypass their security protocols?

30:10.830 --> 30:11.830
Any luck?

30:12.605 --> 30:16.455
I can't find anything that even looks
like an atmosphere recycler.

30:16.704 --> 30:19.572
I'm starting to wonder
if this ship even has life support.

30:19.572 --> 30:21.763
They must have atmosphere on their bridge.

30:25.563 --> 30:28.163
Well, let's hope they don't mind sharing.

30:31.310 --> 30:34.310
The Starfleet ship has moved out of sensor range.

30:35.359 --> 30:38.959
The humans have seen too much.
We can't allow them to escape.

30:41.002 --> 30:43.719
This vessel is a prototype.

30:44.044 --> 30:46.494
I told you it wasn't ready for combat.

30:46.504 --> 30:47.554
Find them!

30:54.358 --> 30:56.508
Captain's Starlog, supplemental.

30:56.655 --> 31:01.555
Our battle damage has been repaired,
and we've resumed our search for the alien vessel.

31:02.069 --> 31:03.369
[door chimes]

31:03.388 --> 31:04.338
Come in.

31:08.891 --> 31:11.783
I analyzed the data Commander Tucker sent back.

31:11.783 --> 31:14.405
The ship doesn't appear
to be Tellarite or Andorian.

31:17.295 --> 31:19.495
Do we have any idea who built it?

31:19.499 --> 31:21.499
There's a remote possibility.

31:21.675 --> 31:24.564
Its power matrix utilizes boridium cells.

31:25.729 --> 31:29.279
We encountered a similar technology
more than two years ago.

31:29.498 --> 31:31.148
The Romulan minefield.

31:32.810 --> 31:36.209
But the power cells on those mines were much larger--
more primitive.

31:36.209 --> 31:38.117
I did say it was a remote possibility.

31:40.700 --> 31:42.550
If this is a Romulan ship,

31:43.540 --> 31:46.840
why would they be stirring up
trouble so far from home?

31:47.295 --> 31:51.745
They have been known to act aggressively
against species they see as a threat.

31:51.873 --> 31:56.823
We've never threatened them.
As far as I know, neither have the Andorians or Tellarites.

31:59.829 --> 32:02.329
Maybe they're afraid of something else.

32:04.787 --> 32:08.173
The species in this region have a history
of not getting along.

32:08.173 --> 32:12.865
This conference could've been the first step in changing that.
You believe they fear an alliance?

32:13.450 --> 32:16.350
The conference has been postponed indefinitely.

32:17.199 --> 32:21.149
It doesn't sound like there's going to be
an alliance any time soon.

32:21.328 --> 32:22.828
Anything from Trip?

32:23.783 --> 32:26.733
We're still too far away
to detect a com signal.

32:27.766 --> 32:29.416
Well, keep me updated.

32:38.097 --> 32:42.747
Another access tube?! I'm starting to wonder
if this ship even has a bridge. Yeah.

32:44.577 --> 32:47.077
Your air's down to 26 minutes, Malcolm!

32:48.761 --> 32:51.311
Perhaps it's on one of the lower levels.

32:51.342 --> 32:55.392
There's no rule that says
the bridge has to be at the top of the ship.

32:56.400 --> 33:00.800
You see these data conduits? Uh-huh.
Chances are they converge on the bridge.

33:01.878 --> 33:05.128
So I understand our first officer's
no longer married.

33:06.108 --> 33:06.908
Yeah?

33:07.321 --> 33:12.471
I was wondering what your intentions were.
Well, who are you, her father? [chuckling] No.

33:12.489 --> 33:13.789
Simply curious.

33:14.016 --> 33:17.355
Malcolm, Malcolm, we've got something.

33:20.642 --> 33:22.321
[grunts]

33:23.660 --> 33:24.760
What is it?

33:25.426 --> 33:27.126
A maneuvering thruster.

33:27.955 --> 33:32.305
Perhaps they'll be kind enough to give us the specs.
It's chemically fueled;

33:33.120 --> 33:35.557
liquid hydrogen and oxygen.

33:38.435 --> 33:40.285
We could refill our tanks.

33:46.110 --> 33:47.410
Can I help you?

33:47.977 --> 33:49.877
I was hoping we could talk.

33:51.112 --> 33:53.112
I doubt you're aware of this.

33:53.476 --> 33:54.876
How could you be?

33:55.938 --> 33:57.685
Andorian women are...

33:59.272 --> 34:05.358
permitted one final conquest
before their wedding.

34:06.383 --> 34:09.683
I've never had relations
with a member of your species.

34:10.329 --> 34:12.379
I was hoping you'd indulge me.

34:12.824 --> 34:14.623
Go back to your quarters.

34:16.438 --> 34:19.039
You won't even consider it?
[footsteps]

34:46.746 --> 34:47.846
What is it?

34:48.510 --> 34:52.909
There's a problem with one of the liquid fuel tanks.
Another malfunction? No.

34:54.655 --> 34:58.055
The starboard transfer valve
has been opened... manually.

34:58.749 --> 35:00.599
Activate internal sensors.

35:04.289 --> 35:05.789
How you holding up?

35:06.109 --> 35:07.759
A little light-headed.

35:08.753 --> 35:10.253
That's nothing new.

35:14.140 --> 35:16.540
I should've known better.
About what?

35:17.883 --> 35:20.383
Getting involved with a fellow officer.

35:21.008 --> 35:26.058
There's nothing going on between us anymore, if you're interested.
That's not why I asked.

35:27.065 --> 35:29.565
You said she had an "awfully nice bum."

35:30.412 --> 35:31.612
This is true.

35:33.470 --> 35:34.620
Pure oxygen.

35:36.601 --> 35:37.751
Be my guest.

35:41.998 --> 35:42.898
Ahhh...

35:45.520 --> 35:46.420
Thanks.

36:07.595 --> 36:08.395
Hold!

36:08.941 --> 36:10.441
Magnify that image.

36:15.844 --> 36:16.744
Humans.

36:17.719 --> 36:20.219
If they make their way to the bridge...

36:20.626 --> 36:23.576
Are the inertial stabilizers off-line?
They are.

36:28.632 --> 36:30.082
Evasive maneuvers.

36:37.490 --> 36:38.640
[grunting]

36:39.350 --> 36:40.956
[gasping, groaning]

36:43.111 --> 36:44.711
Magnetize your boots!

37:17.303 --> 37:18.653
We mustn't be...

37:18.801 --> 37:20.051
What is this?!

37:23.441 --> 37:26.078
I want to know why my ship was attacked.

37:26.767 --> 37:31.290
And then you're going to answer
for your crimes against my people.

37:36.033 --> 37:37.383
What'd you find?

37:37.480 --> 37:42.630
We've discovered the function of the emitters on their hull.
They're holographic projectors.

37:44.046 --> 37:48.846
It's a camouflage system; they can use it
to mimic the appearance of almost any ship.

37:49.290 --> 37:54.390
Malcolm analyzed the Andorian debris.
He said that ship was destroyed by Tellarite weapons.

37:54.576 --> 37:57.376
Their disruptor utilizes tri-phasic emitters.

38:00.189 --> 38:02.777
They can simulate different kinds of weapons.

38:02.777 --> 38:05.863
The one thing they couldn't mask
is their power signature.

38:05.998 --> 38:10.048
That's why they... [com beeps]
Security to Captain Archer. Go ahead.

38:10.340 --> 38:14.134
There's weapons-fire on G-Deck outside the Tellarites' quarters.
On my way.

38:14.134 --> 38:16.784
Get the MACOs down there.
Seal off G-Deck.

38:17.673 --> 38:18.723
[grunts]

38:18.800 --> 38:22.276
We know your government's behind
the disappearance of our freighters.

38:22.276 --> 38:27.776
We had nothing to do with that! You may have been able
to convince Archer, but I'm not so gullible.

38:27.951 --> 38:30.079
I don't know a lot about Starfleet weapons,

38:30.079 --> 38:36.646
but I believe this setting will bore right
through that thick hide of yours.

38:38.264 --> 38:40.396
The truth... now!

38:40.872 --> 38:41.922
[snorts]

38:53.021 --> 38:53.721
Go.

39:15.427 --> 39:18.377
Stay out of this, pinkskin.
Shran, listen to me.

39:18.721 --> 39:21.552
The ship that attacked you wasn't Tellarite.

39:22.407 --> 39:23.557
I was there!

39:23.675 --> 39:25.825
I can prove it was someone else.

39:36.434 --> 39:41.282
You're both being set up. Your ship was attacked
because someone didn't want this conference to go forward.

39:41.630 --> 39:42.380
Who?

39:44.779 --> 39:46.179
I'm asking you...

39:46.998 --> 39:48.798
one captain to another...

39:49.238 --> 39:50.788
look at the evidence

39:50.930 --> 39:53.680
before you do something
you're gonna regret.

40:08.161 --> 40:09.211
[grunts]

40:17.126 --> 40:18.676
Get Phlox down here.

40:21.624 --> 40:22.574
How bad?

40:22.775 --> 40:25.225
It's only superficial.
You'll be fine.

40:32.896 --> 40:35.196
The bridge should be through there!

41:13.759 --> 41:15.659
They've entered the bridge.

41:16.305 --> 41:22.258
