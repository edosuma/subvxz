02:53.614 --> 02:55.881
Marc, can you work that
light in two inches?

02:57.948 --> 02:58.949
Like this?

03:00.549 --> 03:01.949
Uh...

03:01.981 --> 03:03.948
I need to shift that
reflection on the bottle.

03:08.881 --> 03:09.716
There.

03:12.049 --> 03:13.016
That's much better.

03:15.580 --> 03:16.781
Looking great!

03:16.815 --> 03:18.316
As always.

03:28.481 --> 03:29.515
Surprise!

03:32.782 --> 03:33.616
Mom, no!

03:35.081 --> 03:36.448
No, Mom!

03:36.482 --> 03:37.815
Please wake up!

03:41.348 --> 03:41.982
Whoa.

03:44.881 --> 03:46.848
Uh, just give me
that look again.

04:02.981 --> 04:04.649
Daddy, come, please!

04:13.682 --> 04:15.016
Jamie, you cool?

04:15.049 --> 04:17.416
Uh, I'm fine.

04:17.449 --> 04:19.283
Let's take a break.

04:19.315 --> 04:20.981
Lynea needs some touch ups.

04:21.015 --> 04:22.982
I don't think I need any.

04:23.015 --> 04:23.982
Here.

04:24.014 --> 04:25.383
Be right back.

04:51.415 --> 04:53.283
You've
reached Isaac Okeki.

04:53.315 --> 04:54.581
Sorry our times didn't align.

04:56.381 --> 04:58.315
This
mailbox is full.

05:14.382 --> 05:15.016
Isaac!

05:53.547 --> 05:54.348
Here.

05:54.381 --> 05:54.981
I can finish up.

05:55.015 --> 05:56.582
Thanks.

05:56.614 --> 05:58.514
Shit, Marc, I've dumped
everything on you the last week.

05:59.481 --> 06:00.881
Are you okay?

06:00.915 --> 06:03.748
Yeah, I just gotta slow
down on the benzos.

06:03.782 --> 06:06.049
If you're gonna stop, you
should and ween off slowly.

06:06.081 --> 06:09.681
I got, like, crazy hallucinations
last time I stopped.

06:09.714 --> 06:10.948
It fucks with you.

06:11.882 --> 06:13.016
Yeah, I'm cool.

06:13.881 --> 06:14.982
No word yet?

06:15.881 --> 06:16.715
No.

06:17.747 --> 06:18.681
I'm not sure what else to do,

06:18.714 --> 06:20.547
I posted the whole neighborhood.

06:20.580 --> 06:22.282
I called everyone
on his contact list,

06:22.315 --> 06:25.748
and believe me, that was
not great for the ego.

06:25.782 --> 06:27.749
Ex girlfriends?

06:27.782 --> 06:28.582
Worse.

06:28.615 --> 06:30.283
His mother.

06:30.316 --> 06:31.982
By the way, you
were great today.

06:32.014 --> 06:33.015
Thank you, baby.

06:34.448 --> 06:36.582
You know, the cops
called the other day.

06:36.615 --> 06:39.381
They wanted to know when the
last time I saw Isaac was.

06:43.082 --> 06:45.282
I told them it was when he
came here to surprise you

06:45.316 --> 06:47.282
for your 5 year anniversary.

06:49.614 --> 06:50.448
Shit.

06:53.581 --> 06:54.414
I got it.

06:57.082 --> 06:58.515
Hey, brother, how's it going?

06:58.547 --> 06:59.347
Here you go.

06:59.380 --> 07:00.381
Thanks, man.

07:03.814 --> 07:05.481
I got a feelin'.

07:11.316 --> 07:12.381
Yes!

07:13.748 --> 07:14.848
Samplers.

07:14.882 --> 07:16.514
We got it?

07:16.548 --> 07:19.048
International liquor campaign.

07:19.082 --> 07:20.049
We gotta celebrate!

07:20.081 --> 07:21.916
Let's get the gang
back together.

07:23.847 --> 07:25.981
Normally I'd say
yeah, but, I just-

07:26.015 --> 07:27.782
Yeah, yeah, no, sure.

07:27.814 --> 07:29.015
Hey.

07:29.048 --> 07:30.948
I still got tickets to
see Bike Thiefs tonight.

07:30.981 --> 07:31.981
Yeah?

07:32.014 --> 07:33.414

Your pills suck.

I'm sorry.

10:14.447 --> 10:15.381
Do you need a hand?

10:15.414 --> 10:18.414
No, I just want to go
home and sleep this off.

10:52.447 --> 10:53.048
Hello?

10:53.082 --> 10:54.448
Detective Roberts?

10:54.480 --> 10:55.547
Jamie, you don't
need to keep calling.

10:55.580 --> 10:57.281
When I hear something,
I'll let you know.

10:57.314 --> 10:59.447
Give me something
more to do then.

10:59.480 --> 11:01.381
Posters aren't working.

11:01.414 --> 11:02.582
Babe.

11:02.615 --> 11:03.482
Shh.

11:03.514 --> 11:04.548
He could be...

11:06.381 --> 11:07.981
I don't even want
to think about it.

11:08.014 --> 11:10.314
Just know that this case

11:10.348 --> 11:12.315
is a top priority for our unit.

11:13.281 --> 11:16.649
And if you can recall anything
else from that night...

11:16.682 --> 11:17.882
I'm trying.

11:17.914 --> 11:19.715
I've told you all
I can remember.

11:21.347 --> 11:22.615
Okay.

11:22.648 --> 11:25.582
Just please call me, as
soon as you know anything.

11:25.615 --> 11:27.449
Yeah, bye.

11:58.381 --> 11:58.982
Shit.

12:03.415 --> 12:04.249
Isaac?

12:06.047 --> 12:07.481
Isaac!

12:14.548 --> 12:15.382
Stop!

12:43.648 --> 12:44.547
Isaac!

12:44.581 --> 12:45.482
Jamie!

12:45.514 --> 12:46.614
What the hell?

12:46.647 --> 12:47.881
I was so worried.

12:47.914 --> 12:48.981
I can't explain
now, I have to go.

12:49.013 --> 12:49.815
You shouldn't of followed me.

12:49.848 --> 12:50.682
Explain what?

12:51.647 --> 12:53.381
It works.

12:53.414 --> 12:54.648
My research.

12:54.681 --> 12:55.781
- What?
- Water is the conduit.

12:55.815 --> 12:57.447
It's permeable.

12:57.481 --> 12:59.581
I found a way to crossover.

12:59.614 --> 13:01.314
Listen, hey, we can
go over to your place.

13:01.347 --> 13:02.980
It's just up the hill,
I can make you tea,

13:03.014 --> 13:04.581
you can tell me all about it.

13:04.614 --> 13:07.881
No, I can't risk being
absorbed into this dimension.

13:07.914 --> 13:09.447
Isaac, I want to believe you!

13:09.480 --> 13:10.781
I'm doing this to
bring us together.

13:10.814 --> 13:11.649
Just...

13:14.647 --> 13:16.281
Take the trip that we planned.

13:16.314 --> 13:17.781
I'll intercept you there.

13:17.815 --> 13:18.981
Isaac?

13:19.013 --> 13:19.681
It's all
mapped out for you.

13:19.714 --> 13:20.848
Isaac!

13:21.914 --> 13:23.447
Isaac, no!

13:23.480 --> 13:24.681
Not the water!

13:24.714 --> 13:25.515
Isaac!

13:25.548 --> 13:26.582
Shit!

13:28.715 --> 13:29.549
Isaac!

13:33.348 --> 13:33.982
Isaac!

13:35.081 --> 13:38.382
Don't make me go
into the water again!

13:40.048 --> 13:41.982
Help me, somebody help!

13:43.348 --> 13:44.582
Somebody help me!

13:47.882 --> 13:49.482
Detective Roberts.

13:49.515 --> 13:50.815
It's Jamie, I just saw him.

13:50.847 --> 13:54.381
He's in the ravine by
his house, he needs help!

13:54.415 --> 13:55.914
You've got to hurry!

13:55.946 --> 13:57.447
Fuck!

13:57.480 --> 13:58.281
Fuck!

13:58.981 --> 14:00.514
Get help!

14:00.548 --> 14:01.749
Somebody!

14:01.782 --> 14:03.649
Somebody, help!

14:29.715 --> 14:30.582
Fuck.

14:30.614 --> 14:31.648
Charger.

15:02.946 --> 15:04.980
We've come a long way
since Hiroshi and Wyland's

15:05.013 --> 15:06.681
groundbreaking discovery in 2012

15:06.714 --> 15:09.947
that particles can be in
two places at the same time.

15:09.981 --> 15:11.615
From our recent discoveries,

15:11.647 --> 15:14.481
Dr. Garrison and I have
glimpsed an exciting future,

15:14.514 --> 15:17.748
where accessing these parallel
universes is a possibility.

15:17.782 --> 15:19.914
A future where our
quantum realities

15:19.947 --> 15:21.582
will be part of our daily lives.

15:23.980 --> 15:25.581
I'm sorry, who are you?

15:25.615 --> 15:26.515
Discovery Magazine.

15:26.548 --> 15:27.682
You're next month's cover story.

15:27.715 --> 15:29.714
Jen will do the interview.

15:29.747 --> 15:31.548
Dr. Okeki, Dr. Garrison.

15:31.581 --> 15:32.881
Congratulations on your paper,

15:32.913 --> 15:34.347
it's caused quite the stir.

15:34.381 --> 15:36.582
Is it okay if I ask you
a few questions now?

15:36.615 --> 15:38.382
Uh, would it be okay
if you spoke with

15:38.415 --> 15:39.782
my colleague, Dr.
Garrison first?

15:39.813 --> 15:40.880
Um, I...

15:41.782 --> 15:43.714
Would you excuse me, please?

15:43.748 --> 15:44.880
Are you available?

15:44.914 --> 15:46.315
Wow.

15:46.347 --> 15:47.514
You get right to the
point, don't you?

15:47.547 --> 15:48.848
No, sorry.

15:48.881 --> 15:50.848
I mean, we're looking
for a photographer

15:50.880 --> 15:52.282
for the 20th of this month.

15:52.315 --> 15:53.548
Right.

15:53.580 --> 15:54.781
I'm just filling in
for a friend today.

15:54.813 --> 15:56.581
I don't normally
do science events.

15:56.615 --> 15:57.681
Oh, it's for my band.

15:57.715 --> 15:58.714
Oh, yeah?

15:58.747 --> 16:00.347
What's your name?

16:00.380 --> 16:00.947
Isaac.

16:00.980 --> 16:02.315
Yeah, no.

16:02.348 --> 16:03.682
The name of your band.

16:03.714 --> 16:04.880
Oh, right.

16:04.913 --> 16:06.315
Reverb.

16:06.348 --> 16:07.548
Didn't you play at The
Horseshoe last year?

16:07.580 --> 16:09.614
I thought you looked familiar.

16:09.648 --> 16:12.015
Yeah, well, we normally
have more people come out.

16:12.047 --> 16:14.414
No, it was nice to
get a seat for once.

16:14.448 --> 16:16.348
Isaac, there are people.

16:16.380 --> 16:18.581
And that reporter,
they all want to talk.

16:19.648 --> 16:20.581
Oh.

16:20.615 --> 16:22.648
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but this is important.

16:26.047 --> 16:27.449
Looks like I gotta go.

16:32.348 --> 16:33.381
Hey, um...

16:35.847 --> 16:38.415
What are you doing after this?

17:10.013 --> 17:11.615
What?

17:11.647 --> 17:14.482
Yeah, next week I've got
live tiger cubs in my studio.

17:14.513 --> 17:15.681
Really?

17:15.714 --> 17:16.847
Why?

17:16.881 --> 17:18.315
Oh my God.

17:18.347 --> 17:19.780
Have you ever heard
of Tiger Energy Bar?

17:19.814 --> 17:20.582
Yeah.

17:20.614 --> 17:22.781
Yeah, I lived on
them in grad school.

17:22.813 --> 17:24.348
Oh, they're horrible!

17:26.347 --> 17:27.748
Well, they pay my bills.

17:28.814 --> 17:29.614
Here, let me help.

17:29.648 --> 17:30.482
No, I got it.

17:31.746 --> 17:33.415
You bike with all that?

17:33.447 --> 17:35.415
Yeah, I really only
ever take my car

17:35.447 --> 17:37.547
if I have a big shoot
out at the studio.

17:37.580 --> 17:38.381
Oh, yeah?

17:38.414 --> 17:39.847
Yeah.

17:39.881 --> 17:41.747
You know, I was thinking a
lot about your speech tonight.

17:42.880 --> 17:46.880
You were talking about the
possibility of infinite universes

17:46.913 --> 17:49.414
existing parallel to each other.

17:49.448 --> 17:50.680
Yeah.

17:50.714 --> 17:51.649
Created each time
you make a choice.

17:51.680 --> 17:52.947
Come on.

17:52.981 --> 17:55.681
You really think we have
control over our choices?

17:55.713 --> 17:56.947
Absolutely.

17:56.980 --> 18:00.649
So, somewhere in a
alternate universe

18:00.680 --> 18:03.981
there's a Jamie who chose
not to be a photographer,

18:04.013 --> 18:06.514
and therefore never meets you?

18:06.547 --> 18:07.747
Correct.

18:07.780 --> 18:11.047
But if your choices
were to re-align,

18:11.081 --> 18:13.616
then your parallel
universes might converge.

18:14.980 --> 18:17.814
But wouldn't we be
two different people?

18:17.846 --> 18:19.780
Well, your mind would edit
out the inconsistencies.

18:19.813 --> 18:22.947
You would re-imagine
people or specific events

18:22.981 --> 18:24.681
to reconcile what doesn't fit.

18:26.814 --> 18:28.448
So, what's the end game?

18:28.480 --> 18:29.847
Oh, I figured I'd
get your number

18:29.880 --> 18:31.514
and see if we
could go out again.

18:31.548 --> 18:34.048
No, I meant with your research!

18:34.080 --> 18:35.780
And do you really think
one day we'll be able

18:35.814 --> 18:38.015
to crossover to
parallel universes?

18:38.047 --> 18:38.947
Well, you're already doing it

18:38.981 --> 18:40.848
each time you make a decision.

18:40.880 --> 18:43.780
But what I'm interested in
is the conscious tracking

18:43.814 --> 18:44.715
and control of it.

18:46.980 --> 18:49.381
Well, this is me.

18:55.014 --> 18:57.781
Do you want to come up and
play me some of your tunes?

18:57.813 --> 18:59.747
I really would,
but I got some work to do.

18:59.781 --> 19:00.748
So late at night?

19:01.814 --> 19:02.714
It's for a private funder,

19:02.748 --> 19:04.815
and these guys don't
like to be kept waiting.

19:07.348 --> 19:11.848
Listen, can we meet again soon?

19:11.881 --> 19:12.715
Please?

19:14.980 --> 19:15.814
Sure.

19:19.048 --> 19:21.681
Somewhere there's
a timeline where

19:21.713 --> 19:23.514
we hooked up right
now, isn't there?

19:25.813 --> 19:27.680
I had a really nice night.

19:27.714 --> 19:28.549
Me too.

20:10.315 --> 20:11.914
Why did they bring me here?

20:11.947 --> 20:14.781
I should be out there helping!

20:14.813 --> 20:15.880
Did you get my message?

20:15.914 --> 20:16.948
It was all broken up,

20:16.981 --> 20:17.981
I couldn't make it out.

20:18.013 --> 20:19.880
But I just saw him!

20:19.913 --> 20:22.648
I should be out there
helping you guys.

20:22.680 --> 20:24.515
I just saw him, you
guys should be out there

20:24.546 --> 20:25.347
looking for him.

20:25.380 --> 20:26.014
Jamie...

20:27.780 --> 20:28.615
We found him.

20:30.381 --> 20:31.015
Isaac's dead.

20:39.048 --> 20:40.249
What?

20:43.014 --> 20:45.880
We found Isaac's
body washed up on shore.

20:48.814 --> 20:49.581
You...

20:51.947 --> 20:53.048
You just found him-

20:53.081 --> 20:54.915
He was discovered this morning.

20:57.415 --> 20:59.981
Pathologist's report place
his time of death a week ago.

21:01.580 --> 21:03.947
Consistent with the time that
you reported him missing.

21:06.747 --> 21:07.848
A week ago? No.

21:09.780 --> 21:13.747
It's evident by the
condition of his remains.

21:13.781 --> 21:14.615
It's not him.

21:15.847 --> 21:17.015
It can't be.

21:20.781 --> 21:22.249
I need to see him, right?

21:23.014 --> 21:24.014
To identify the body?

21:24.048 --> 21:26.282
His family already has.

21:26.315 --> 21:28.781
The dental records
are also a match.

21:28.814 --> 21:30.047
So the missing person case

21:30.081 --> 21:32.513
has become a homicide
investigation,

21:32.546 --> 21:34.248
which is why we've
brought you in.

21:39.014 --> 21:40.249
Homicide?

21:41.714 --> 21:43.615
We're starting to
interview suspects.

21:45.513 --> 21:46.913
But I already told you,

21:46.947 --> 21:47.981
he left the house
on his bike, I-

21:48.014 --> 21:51.014
Stop, stop, before
you go any further.

21:51.047 --> 21:52.947
I need to tell you that
anything you're telling me here

21:52.981 --> 21:54.815
will be admitted into evidence.

21:56.646 --> 21:58.014
Do you wish to call a lawyer?

22:15.814 --> 22:16.648
Yeah.

22:26.713 --> 22:27.547
Jamie?

22:31.746 --> 22:32.580
Jamie?

22:53.846 --> 22:56.780
Oh, don't
worry, I'm alive.

22:56.814 --> 22:57.581
Just go.

22:58.746 --> 23:00.513
Fuck you, okay?

23:00.547 --> 23:01.748
I've been calling
you for two days.

23:01.780 --> 23:02.580
How about a little courtesy,

23:02.614 --> 23:04.047
let me know you're okay!

23:04.080 --> 23:05.847
Don't just let yourself
into my apartment

23:05.881 --> 23:07.282
whenever you want!

23:07.314 --> 23:08.513
The spare keys are for
emergencies, you got it?

23:08.546 --> 23:09.780
This is an emergency, okay?

23:09.813 --> 23:11.281
Look at you!

23:11.315 --> 23:12.781
You need help.

23:12.814 --> 23:14.680
I am perfectly fine.

23:16.081 --> 23:18.881
Now get out of
here, let me shower.

23:59.681 --> 24:01.048
You didn't have to do that.

24:01.080 --> 24:02.580
Hey, no worries.

24:12.014 --> 24:14.015
Things are gonna get better.

24:14.047 --> 24:15.248
They have to, right?

24:16.946 --> 24:19.414
Fuck them for making
me miss the funeral!

24:22.514 --> 24:25.414
Look, the case is
closed now, right?

24:25.446 --> 24:27.313
The cops ruled
out any foul play.

24:31.081 --> 24:32.314
Coffee?

24:45.714 --> 24:47.347
Last time I was at his place,

24:48.480 --> 24:50.381
I saw a map of the
trip we were planning.

24:50.413 --> 24:51.913
Shit.

24:51.947 --> 24:53.048
I forgot to cancel the tickets.

24:53.081 --> 24:54.313
We were gonna go tomorrow.

24:54.347 --> 24:55.614
I know, I'm sorry,
I'll call and see

24:55.647 --> 24:56.547
if I can get a refund.

24:56.579 --> 24:58.681
It doesn't matter, it's like,

24:58.713 --> 25:01.314
I'm sitting here and I'm not.

25:01.346 --> 25:03.480
I don't even know
how to explain it.

25:12.014 --> 25:13.380
No need to explain.

25:14.446 --> 25:15.813
Come here.

25:42.414 --> 25:43.015
Whoa!

25:43.048 --> 25:44.481
I'm sorry.

25:46.080 --> 25:47.280
Forget it.

25:55.346 --> 25:56.513
Marc?

25:56.547 --> 25:57.346
Yeah.

25:57.380 --> 25:58.948
Leave my keys, okay?

26:06.048 --> 26:08.247
Call me if you need anything.

26:26.913 --> 26:29.480
First
unheard message.

26:29.514 --> 26:31.446
Hi, I'm calling from
the women's choice clinic

26:31.480 --> 26:34.248
confirming your appointment
on March 30th at five...

26:59.580 --> 27:01.381
This has
to be the best mug.

27:01.414 --> 27:02.414
It's chipped.

27:02.446 --> 27:03.280
It's vintage.

27:04.314 --> 27:06.648
Plus they gave me a discount
on this cool pocket knife.

27:06.680 --> 27:07.613
Look.

27:07.647 --> 27:09.347
There's a mermaid on it.

27:09.379 --> 27:11.947
What does a physicist need
a pocket knife for anyway?

27:11.981 --> 27:13.381
Slicing atoms?

27:14.614 --> 27:16.413
That's splitting atoms.

27:16.447 --> 27:18.014
Get your references
straight, Irving.

27:18.047 --> 27:19.380
It'll be great for our trip.

27:19.414 --> 27:20.414
Our trip?

27:20.446 --> 27:21.446
Mhm.

27:21.480 --> 27:23.547
The one Renata's
making us cancel?

27:23.579 --> 27:25.947
She had concerns, but I
worked them out with her.

27:26.880 --> 27:28.613
Oh, she'll find another excuse.

27:28.647 --> 27:30.280
We're going.

27:30.313 --> 27:31.513
Eh, we'll see.

27:32.814 --> 27:34.381
I wanted to surprise you.

27:35.014 --> 27:35.848
But look.

27:37.479 --> 27:38.780
I've already booked our place.

27:39.746 --> 27:41.014
Are you fucking serious?

27:41.048 --> 27:42.480
Yeah.

27:42.514 --> 27:44.547
Right on a mountain cliff
overlooking the ocean.

27:44.580 --> 27:45.614
It's beautiful.

27:45.647 --> 27:47.781
And the beach is
right down there.

27:47.813 --> 27:48.980
Oh.

27:49.013 --> 27:50.414
I'm not into frying
on the beach.

27:50.446 --> 27:53.047
I thought we could
explore the islands,

27:53.080 --> 27:55.547
and I'd like to
take some photos.

27:55.580 --> 27:57.681
You don't have to
be afraid of water.

27:57.714 --> 27:59.381
Hey, I'll be there with you.

27:59.414 --> 28:01.615
I might just do some
things on my own.

28:02.413 --> 28:04.614
I've never seen you
pass up a challenge.

28:06.513 --> 28:08.313
Henry will join me.

28:08.347 --> 28:09.481
I've got it all mapped out.

28:24.680 --> 28:26.380
Jamie?

28:26.414 --> 28:27.548
I changed my mind.

28:28.813 --> 28:30.446
Oh, wow!

28:30.480 --> 28:31.514
Okay.

28:31.546 --> 28:32.480
Can you come back?

28:33.514 --> 28:34.414
Are you sure?

28:34.447 --> 28:35.747
If you're not too far yet.

28:37.513 --> 28:39.513
I'm gonna take the trip.

28:39.547 --> 28:40.581
I need to take it.

28:41.747 --> 28:43.313
Oh.

28:43.346 --> 28:44.513
By yourself?

28:44.546 --> 28:45.513
Yeah.

28:45.546 --> 28:46.847
Do you think you could swing by

28:46.880 --> 28:49.647
and grab my keys and water
my plants while I'm gone?

28:49.681 --> 28:53.380
Jamie, I mean, I
just got on the bus.

28:53.413 --> 28:54.647
Oh, no worries.

28:55.813 --> 28:56.647
I'll leave them
in the usual spot.

28:56.681 --> 28:57.614
Cool?

28:57.646 --> 28:58.614
What about the studio?

28:58.646 --> 29:00.314
Why don't you do the head shots,

29:00.346 --> 29:02.514
and I'll reschedule the rest.

29:02.546 --> 29:03.346
Really?

29:03.380 --> 29:04.380
Yeah, you'll be great.

29:05.379 --> 29:05.981
You think?

29:06.012 --> 29:06.813
Yeah.

29:06.847 --> 29:07.948
You've got a great eye.

29:07.981 --> 29:09.581
You should trust it.

30:07.614 --> 30:08.448
Fuckers.

32:03.479 --> 32:04.547
Fuck, where's the map?

35:20.645 --> 35:22.779
Well, let's do the vodka
meeting over Skype then.

35:23.913 --> 35:24.680
Seriously, Jamie?

35:24.713 --> 35:25.847
The biggest meeting
of your career.

35:25.879 --> 35:27.546
What the fuck?

35:27.579 --> 35:30.346
Please, just give me some
space to breathe here.

35:30.380 --> 35:32.047
Are you okay?

35:32.079 --> 35:32.879
I just mean-

35:32.912 --> 35:34.280
I'm fine.

35:34.313 --> 35:35.480
Okay.

35:35.513 --> 35:37.480
Let's reschedule the
meeting 'til next week.

35:37.513 --> 35:38.712
Next week, sounds good.

35:38.746 --> 35:40.547
I'll do the touch ups,
I'm working on them now.

35:40.580 --> 35:43.581
Just take care of
yourself, okay?

35:43.613 --> 35:44.413
Jamie?

35:44.446 --> 35:45.779
I gotta go!

35:45.812 --> 35:46.846
Isaac?

35:47.846 --> 35:48.780
Isaac!

35:51.580 --> 35:52.414
Hey!

35:57.879 --> 35:58.947
Sorry.

35:58.980 --> 36:00.348
Oh, can I help you?

36:01.812 --> 36:04.679
Sorry, I thought you
were somebody else.

36:04.713 --> 36:05.880
That's okay.

36:05.913 --> 36:07.880
I think it's typical
when you travel,

36:07.913 --> 36:09.914
you look for the familiar.

36:12.479 --> 36:13.880
I guess so.

36:13.912 --> 36:16.913
I'm not from around
here either, I...

36:16.946 --> 36:20.981
Well, not originally,
just for now I stay here.

36:22.912 --> 36:25.812
I have a small bar down
the street by the beach

36:25.846 --> 36:28.812
if you want to
come and visit us.

36:28.845 --> 36:32.347
We have a singer tonight
from the mainland.

36:33.446 --> 36:36.013
Madeleine Bar, just down there.

36:36.046 --> 36:37.879
I'm not sure I can.

36:37.912 --> 36:38.980
Thank you.

36:39.012 --> 36:40.713
Okay, bye.

38:04.079 --> 38:04.914
Fuck!

38:07.013 --> 38:07.813
Easy.

38:07.845 --> 38:08.680
I got it.

38:15.979 --> 38:18.346
Driving manual's a cinch.

38:18.379 --> 38:20.646
I told you I'd pick it up fast.

38:20.680 --> 38:21.913
You're a pro.

38:21.946 --> 38:23.280
You'll be great in Europe.

38:23.314 --> 38:23.947
Wait, tell me
you're talking about

38:23.980 --> 38:25.612
our trip to the Azores, right?

38:25.646 --> 38:27.381
I don't understand why you
won't at least consider it.

38:27.413 --> 38:28.712
You can set up a
photography studio-

38:28.745 --> 38:30.313
And start over in Geneva?

38:34.414 --> 38:36.346
I can't pass up an
opportunity like this, Jamie.

38:36.379 --> 38:37.779
I just can't.

38:37.812 --> 38:39.912
People wait their whole
lives for a chance like this.

38:39.946 --> 38:41.314
I get it.

38:42.578 --> 38:43.813
And I'm so happy for you.

38:45.646 --> 38:47.479
Do you understand the
importance of my work?

38:47.512 --> 38:48.714
The implications of it?

38:53.912 --> 38:56.812
We could try out the
long distance thing.

38:56.845 --> 38:58.281
Yeah, I just don't know how.

38:58.313 --> 38:59.314
We have a hard enough
time crossing the city

38:59.347 --> 39:00.014
to see each other.

39:01.079 --> 39:01.913
An ocean?

39:03.980 --> 39:05.281
Just think how
much fun we'll have

39:05.314 --> 39:06.314
every time we re-unite.

40:25.313 --> 40:26.647
No, come back!

41:13.478 --> 41:14.746
Hello?

41:14.780 --> 41:17.346
Hi, Renata?

41:17.378 --> 41:18.014
Jamie?

41:19.345 --> 41:20.046
I can barely hear you.

41:20.079 --> 41:21.313
Where are you?

41:22.779 --> 41:24.413
I'm by the ocean.

41:24.445 --> 41:25.713
What?

41:25.745 --> 41:27.346
I'm in the Azores, San Miguel?

41:28.746 --> 41:31.513
Oh, you went.

41:31.545 --> 41:33.312
I had to, Renata.

41:33.346 --> 41:35.679
I have some questions about
the research you're doing.

41:35.712 --> 41:37.379
I found a notebook of Isaac's,

41:37.413 --> 41:39.345
it was hidden in
a picture frame.

41:39.378 --> 41:40.912
Jamie...

41:40.946 --> 41:42.580
It said alternative
multiverse theory.

41:42.612 --> 41:44.480
Stop talking, please.

41:44.512 --> 41:46.313
Not on the phone.

41:49.379 --> 41:50.446
Fuck.

43:54.413 --> 43:55.647
I'm glad you decided to come.

43:57.579 --> 43:59.513
I didn't feel like being
by myself right now.

44:02.046 --> 44:03.613
What a beautiful voice.

44:04.780 --> 44:06.014
Yes, it's called fado.

44:07.012 --> 44:08.813
Traditionally from the mainland.

44:09.746 --> 44:12.447
And the song is about saudade.

44:13.213 --> 44:15.446
I don't know how you
say it in English,

44:15.479 --> 44:20.480
it's like homesick, or
like the pain you feel

44:21.479 --> 44:22.447
for the love you miss.

44:27.545 --> 44:30.445
I know someone who
would've really loved this.

44:30.479 --> 44:31.546
So, you
should tell them

44:31.579 --> 44:32.814
to come and visit the island.

44:34.312 --> 44:35.779
He was supposed to, but...

44:37.013 --> 44:37.946
He left you?

44:37.979 --> 44:39.412
Oh, stupid man.

44:40.945 --> 44:41.879
It's worse.

44:45.645 --> 44:46.479
Oh.

44:48.446 --> 44:52.413
I lost my daughter to
the waves four years ago.

44:55.945 --> 44:57.479
I'm sorry.

44:57.513 --> 44:59.513
I got this bar to
be close to her.

45:00.311 --> 45:04.946
My wife said I lost
my head, and she left,

45:04.979 --> 45:06.746
she went back to the mainland.

45:08.613 --> 45:10.580
But this is the
only thing I can do.

45:12.446 --> 45:13.412
I stay here.

45:14.645 --> 45:15.512
I wait for her.

45:16.712 --> 45:20.980
Wait for the waves to
return her back to me.

45:23.446 --> 45:25.779
Did you ever see her afterwards?

45:28.379 --> 45:29.780
Yes, I still do sometimes.

45:32.312 --> 45:32.946
By the water.

45:34.813 --> 45:35.647
You?

45:51.912 --> 45:52.746
Excuse me.

48:41.679 --> 48:43.045
Shit!

48:43.079 --> 48:44.746
I'm so sorry.

48:44.779 --> 48:46.679
That's all right,
you're only 15 minutes late.

48:46.712 --> 48:47.911
Are you close by?

48:47.945 --> 48:49.614
No, actually...

48:50.512 --> 48:52.313
I'm overseas for work,

48:52.345 --> 48:54.780
and I totally forgot to
reschedule my appointment.

48:54.813 --> 48:56.713
Okay, I can
reschedule you now.

48:57.712 --> 48:58.878
Oh, I don't know.

49:00.645 --> 49:01.479
I'm not sure?

49:02.779 --> 49:03.512
When's my cutoff?

49:03.546 --> 49:05.546
Well,
you're at 14 weeks.

49:05.579 --> 49:06.679
We have an opening Friday.

49:07.713 --> 49:08.612
I don't know.

49:08.646 --> 49:09.680
Would you rather
book an appointment

49:09.712 --> 49:10.713
with a counselor?

49:10.746 --> 49:11.747
I'll call you back.

49:32.479 --> 49:33.347
Hey, Marc.

49:34.445 --> 49:35.613
You haven't been
answering your phone.

49:36.578 --> 49:37.779
I rescheduled the meeting.

49:37.812 --> 49:40.045
Yeah, cell reception
isn't great here.

49:40.078 --> 49:41.713
You never made your selects

49:41.746 --> 49:43.280
for the perfume shoot
either, so I just picked.

49:43.312 --> 49:45.479
I'm sure you did a fine job.

49:45.513 --> 49:47.279
It doesn't really matter anyway.

49:47.312 --> 49:48.911
Everything matters.

49:48.944 --> 49:49.845
You know who taught me that?

49:49.878 --> 49:51.412
Hold on a sec, be right back.

49:55.512 --> 49:56.580
Hey, what's that on
the wall behind you?

49:56.613 --> 49:57.747
Huh?

49:57.779 --> 49:58.979
Oh, it's nothing.

49:59.012 --> 50:01.713
I'm just trying to
figure some stuff out.

50:01.746 --> 50:02.845
Jamie, this is way messed up.

50:02.879 --> 50:04.280
Are you on something?

50:04.313 --> 50:06.713
No, I'm just coming
off of your crap.

50:06.745 --> 50:08.412
Yeah, I told you to
ween off slowly, okay?

50:08.445 --> 50:10.745
That shit hits hard, like
hallucinations and shit.

50:13.313 --> 50:13.946
Fuck.

50:15.745 --> 50:17.779
Look, why don't you get a
flight back in the morning?

50:17.812 --> 50:19.513
I got something to
take the edge off.

50:19.546 --> 50:20.946
Uh, I can't right now.

50:22.712 --> 50:23.745
You sure?

50:23.779 --> 50:25.413
I'll let you know.

50:29.845 --> 50:32.446
Are you trying to
tell me something?

50:37.545 --> 50:39.679
Isaac, did you
rearrange the papers?

50:42.778 --> 50:43.579
Fuck!

50:46.844 --> 50:47.647
Fuck!

50:50.978 --> 50:53.012
Stop messing with my head!

50:53.045 --> 50:54.711
Stop!

50:54.744 --> 50:55.547
Stop!

50:58.312 --> 50:58.912
Fuck!

51:01.680 --> 51:02.512
Fuck!

51:03.978 --> 51:04.812
Fuck!

51:06.812 --> 51:09.678
Tell me how to get to you!

51:19.512 --> 51:20.811
I trust you.

51:20.845 --> 51:22.614
Tell me what to do.

51:52.744 --> 51:55.778
Let me tell you a story
about these two lakes.

51:55.812 --> 51:58.045
Once, there was a
princess and a farmer boy,

51:58.078 --> 52:00.412
and they loved each
other very much.

52:01.811 --> 52:04.246
But the princess's father
wouldn't let them be together.

52:05.446 --> 52:07.778
So, on a misty day,
just like this one,

52:08.945 --> 52:10.280
they walked into
the fog together

52:10.312 --> 52:12.379
and were never seen again.

52:12.412 --> 52:13.312
Why?

52:13.345 --> 52:14.545
Well, maybe their love

52:14.578 --> 52:16.545
just wasn't meant
for this world.

52:52.446 --> 52:53.646
Hello?

52:53.679 --> 52:54.646
Your breath
sounds erratic,

52:54.678 --> 52:55.612
what's happening?

52:55.645 --> 52:56.879
I'm fine!

52:56.912 --> 52:58.745
I'm sorry I
was so brisk earlier.

52:58.778 --> 53:00.912
My flight arrives in
San Miguel later today.

53:00.944 --> 53:02.345
What?

53:02.378 --> 53:02.946
I'll send you
a text confirmation

53:02.978 --> 53:04.012
of the reservation.

53:04.046 --> 53:04.879
Seriously?

53:24.012 --> 53:24.846
You're late.

53:26.079 --> 53:27.480
And you?

53:27.512 --> 53:28.878
You came all this way.

53:29.779 --> 53:30.980
I was concerned.

53:32.346 --> 53:33.280
About your wellbeing.

53:33.312 --> 53:34.279
What do you want?

53:35.712 --> 53:37.711
See, Isaac's
unexpected departure

53:37.744 --> 53:42.745
has put me in a bind
with our angel investor.

53:43.011 --> 53:43.646
I had...

53:52.845 --> 53:53.679
Obrigada.

53:56.912 --> 54:00.012
I'm quite sure they've
tapped my phones, my email.

54:00.678 --> 54:02.544
Isaac was working on something

54:02.578 --> 54:04.446
that was critical
to our project.

54:04.479 --> 54:05.846
So you thought
the notebook was-

54:05.879 --> 54:07.579
I'm rather surprised
you found it.

54:07.611 --> 54:10.945
I did a fairly thorough
sweep of his office.

54:10.979 --> 54:12.646
Did his family let you in?

54:13.978 --> 54:15.012
Jamie.

54:16.012 --> 54:19.312
You've got to know, you weren't
their ideal daughter-in-law.

54:21.011 --> 54:22.778
You don't even have
a graduate degree,

54:22.811 --> 54:24.013
for goodness sake.

54:24.046 --> 54:25.578
I didn't come here
to be insulted.

54:26.978 --> 54:30.445
If I could just see the
book, and I'll be on my way.

54:30.477 --> 54:31.280
You know, I have some
questions about your-

54:31.312 --> 54:32.512
If I could have a look-

54:32.544 --> 54:34.613
No, you answer my
questions first!

54:40.345 --> 54:40.980
Okay.

54:45.812 --> 54:48.946
If you were to cross
to a parallel plane,

54:51.578 --> 54:54.511
would you see other
versions of yourself?

54:58.313 --> 55:00.645
The theory is if
subatomic particles

55:00.679 --> 55:03.012
can exist in two planes
at the same time,

55:05.313 --> 55:06.979
then perhaps so can we.

55:07.012 --> 55:10.479
If you were crossing from
one dimension to another,

55:10.512 --> 55:12.845
how would you know
which one was yours?

55:12.879 --> 55:15.279
I suppose you could
leave a marker.

55:15.312 --> 55:16.012
A marker?

55:16.045 --> 55:17.578
A distinguishing
mark, like an X.

55:17.611 --> 55:19.878
Since when are you so
interested in our research?

55:19.912 --> 55:21.946
You only ever distracted
Isaac from it-

55:21.979 --> 55:25.012
Trust me, he was
not complaining.

55:27.046 --> 55:28.812
I've answered your questions,

55:28.845 --> 55:30.413
now I'd like some answers.

55:30.444 --> 55:32.778
You know what's
really bothering me?

55:32.812 --> 55:34.247
Is why did he hide it?

55:34.944 --> 55:35.979
The notebook.

55:37.312 --> 55:38.946
You think he hid it for you?

55:39.879 --> 55:42.846
Look, I'm not suggesting
you weren't capable

55:42.878 --> 55:44.512
of understanding the work.

55:46.912 --> 55:47.812
Jamie, I came here to help.

55:47.844 --> 55:50.544
To help yourself, right?

55:50.577 --> 55:52.279
Don't pretend otherwise.

57:19.045 --> 57:20.545
Don't trust...

57:25.378 --> 57:26.879
Don't trust who?

57:57.444 --> 57:58.278
Fuck.

58:13.912 --> 58:15.012
Roberts here.

58:15.979 --> 58:18.278
It's Jamie Irving,
returning your call.

58:19.411 --> 58:21.411
I appreciate you
calling me back.

58:21.444 --> 58:22.646
Do I have a choice?

58:24.644 --> 58:26.278
There's been
a break in at Isaac's.

58:26.312 --> 58:27.813
Are you gonna arrest me?

58:28.944 --> 58:30.745
Oh, no, I just have
a few questions.

58:31.945 --> 58:33.912
I don't think his
death was an accident.

58:35.377 --> 58:36.445
Seriously?

58:46.812 --> 58:47.979
Shh.

58:48.012 --> 58:50.379
For Christ's sake,
it's 4:30 a.m.

58:50.411 --> 58:51.212
What?

58:51.245 --> 58:53.545
For Christs sake,
it's like 4:30 a.m.,

58:53.577 --> 58:55.278
I thought this was an emergency.

58:56.445 --> 58:58.013
It's like 4:30 a.m.,

58:58.045 --> 58:59.346
I thought this was an emergency.

59:01.444 --> 59:04.578
Sorry, I didn't
realize the time.

59:04.611 --> 59:06.478
Everything is just
so screwed up.

59:08.444 --> 59:11.745
I thought the
investigation was closed.

59:11.778 --> 59:15.344
It was, until someone messed
up his place pretty bad.

59:15.377 --> 59:17.911
Do you know anything
about his investors?

59:17.944 --> 59:22.945
I know that he and Renata
disagreed about one of them,

59:23.679 --> 59:24.479
I don't know why.

59:24.511 --> 59:25.478
There.

59:25.512 --> 59:26.646
She's finally asleep.

59:29.045 --> 59:29.912
Is it hard?

59:31.778 --> 59:33.444
What?

59:33.477 --> 59:34.445
Having a baby?

59:36.477 --> 59:38.878
It's the hardest thing
I've ever done in my life.

59:48.377 --> 59:49.411
I...

59:52.445 --> 59:53.379
I gotta go.

01:00:44.812 --> 01:00:46.445
Isaac!

01:02:04.411 --> 01:02:05.811
How's it going back there?

01:02:05.845 --> 01:02:07.045
Oh, fine.

01:02:07.078 --> 01:02:08.379
Wish I hadn't
almost hit that girl

01:02:08.411 --> 01:02:09.545
getting off the street car.

01:02:10.945 --> 01:02:12.544
You're the one
that wanted a bike lesson.

01:02:12.577 --> 01:02:13.545
Yeah, but couldn't
it wait 'til spring?

01:02:15.545 --> 01:02:16.645
You're the one that
wanted a bike lesson.

01:02:16.678 --> 01:02:18.611
Yeah, but couldn't
it wait 'til spring?

01:02:19.778 --> 01:02:20.913
Let's do this, wimp!

01:02:53.545 --> 01:02:54.346
May I?

01:02:55.711 --> 01:02:58.879
Jamie, I know we've had
our differences, and I...

01:03:01.745 --> 01:03:03.746
I think we can
assist each other.

01:03:03.778 --> 01:03:04.779
I truly do.

01:03:06.478 --> 01:03:07.645
Please.

01:03:07.678 --> 01:03:08.845
Can we just talk?

01:03:10.512 --> 01:03:11.545
Please.

01:03:12.879 --> 01:03:14.779
Just a minute.

01:03:14.812 --> 01:03:15.646
Just...

01:03:18.779 --> 01:03:19.613
Thank you.

01:03:27.844 --> 01:03:28.678
Oh, my.

01:03:43.477 --> 01:03:45.511
I'm just trying to
understand things.

01:03:47.344 --> 01:03:48.579
I was wondering...

01:03:50.611 --> 01:03:52.378
Maybe he's reaching out to me.

01:03:55.045 --> 01:03:58.645
You think Isaac just hopped
over some parallel plane?

01:03:58.679 --> 01:03:59.479
I don't know.

01:04:00.378 --> 01:04:01.579
Could he?

01:04:01.611 --> 01:04:02.679
You're serious?

01:04:08.879 --> 01:04:10.246
Interesting framing.

01:04:12.712 --> 01:04:14.679
Jamie and Renata?

01:04:14.712 --> 01:04:16.712
No way, they can't
stand each other.

01:04:16.745 --> 01:04:18.910
Then why are they in the
Azores together so soon

01:04:18.943 --> 01:04:20.245
after Isaac's death?

01:04:21.678 --> 01:04:24.612
Jamie got tickets
months back with Isaac.

01:04:24.644 --> 01:04:25.977
She needed to get
away for a while.

01:04:26.010 --> 01:04:27.544
Okay.

01:04:27.578 --> 01:04:28.878
Just so we're clear here,

01:04:28.911 --> 01:04:31.412
if I decide to bust your
ass today for dealing-

01:04:31.445 --> 01:04:33.579
Look, I'm not a dealer, okay?

01:04:33.612 --> 01:04:35.445
It's just a side thing
for a few friends

01:04:35.477 --> 01:04:37.044
to help keep my clients happy.

01:04:37.077 --> 01:04:38.944
With your priors?

01:04:38.977 --> 01:04:40.311
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

01:04:40.344 --> 01:04:42.278
Lucky for you,

01:04:43.477 --> 01:04:46.511
if you play nice,

01:04:48.312 --> 01:04:51.613
and answer my questions,
I could overlook that.

01:05:00.644 --> 01:05:02.478
When was the last time you ate?

01:05:02.512 --> 01:05:04.379
I haven't been hungry.

01:05:04.412 --> 01:05:07.845
And how many hours are you
sleeping each night on average?

01:05:07.877 --> 01:05:09.378
Why do you care?

01:05:09.411 --> 01:05:10.978
Isaac was my good friend.

01:05:11.010 --> 01:05:13.612
Obviously, there's something
going on here with you.

01:05:15.611 --> 01:05:16.712
Oh.

01:05:16.744 --> 01:05:17.778
I can work with this.

01:05:21.910 --> 01:05:22.746
What's that?

01:05:24.345 --> 01:05:26.812
It's a map Isaac
made for us, for me.

01:05:27.545 --> 01:05:29.977
And you think
it'll lead to him?

01:05:30.011 --> 01:05:32.812
Every time I visit one of
these marked locations,

01:05:32.843 --> 01:05:34.045
I get glimpses.

01:05:34.078 --> 01:05:36.045
Alternate versions
of myself and Isaac

01:05:36.078 --> 01:05:37.779
as we exist in other planes,

01:05:37.811 --> 01:05:40.812
and now it feels like
things are really shifting.

01:05:41.678 --> 01:05:42.778
Shifting, huh?

01:05:42.810 --> 01:05:43.945
I've been doing some research.

01:05:43.977 --> 01:05:45.712
You mean Googling?

01:05:45.744 --> 01:05:50.745
Renata, I saw a glimpse of
myself with Isaac and a child.

01:05:51.679 --> 01:05:52.712
It was our daughter.

01:05:52.746 --> 01:05:55.912
I saw a reality where we
all took this trip together.

01:05:57.578 --> 01:06:00.845
And she was so beautiful,
her face, her sweet eyes.

01:06:03.344 --> 01:06:05.811
That's what's making this
choice even more difficult.

01:06:07.512 --> 01:06:08.512
What choice?

01:06:14.679 --> 01:06:15.713
Oh.

01:06:18.411 --> 01:06:21.844
Jamie moved to Canada
after her mom, you know...

01:06:21.878 --> 01:06:23.445
I know she stayed with
her aunt for a while,

01:06:23.478 --> 01:06:25.679
but she got out of there
as soon as she could.

01:06:25.712 --> 01:06:28.245
And she and Isaac were
together for how long?

01:06:29.777 --> 01:06:31.278
Off and on five years?

01:06:33.878 --> 01:06:35.279
You didn't like him.

01:06:35.312 --> 01:06:36.346
I didn't say that.

01:06:37.778 --> 01:06:39.746
It must've stung when she
discarded you for Isaac

01:06:39.778 --> 01:06:41.545
and was planning
to leave with him.

01:06:42.678 --> 01:06:44.511
Jamie's a free spirit.

01:06:50.545 --> 01:06:51.646
I have to take this.

01:06:53.978 --> 01:06:55.312
Here you go.

01:06:58.311 --> 01:06:59.811
Looks great, Renata.

01:07:00.978 --> 01:07:01.812
Thank you.

01:07:04.878 --> 01:07:07.512
What's this
at Porto Formoso Beach?

01:07:07.545 --> 01:07:11.245
That's the last destination.

01:07:12.679 --> 01:07:14.479
Isaac whispered it to me
when I was on the rocks,

01:07:14.512 --> 01:07:15.978
I just couldn't
hear it all clearly.

01:07:16.010 --> 01:07:18.278
You really believe
you're accessing

01:07:18.311 --> 01:07:19.977
a privileged perspective?

01:07:20.010 --> 01:07:22.844
I know it sounds
totally fucked, but...

01:07:22.878 --> 01:07:25.745
You're hypothesizing
that Isaac visiting you

01:07:25.777 --> 01:07:29.646
has opened up your perception
beyond your limited senses,

01:07:29.678 --> 01:07:33.412
and now you're
basically detecting

01:07:33.444 --> 01:07:35.344
what the rest of
us are blind to?

01:07:35.377 --> 01:07:36.345
And if it's true?

01:07:37.511 --> 01:07:38.411
You're
asking if this is

01:07:38.445 --> 01:07:39.878
enlightenment or madness?

01:07:39.910 --> 01:07:41.645
Well, you're the scientist.

01:07:41.679 --> 01:07:42.711
I don't know.

01:07:42.744 --> 01:07:46.411
The possibility exists that
they're one in the same.

01:07:46.444 --> 01:07:47.911
All I have are your words.

01:08:21.843 --> 01:08:22.676
What?

01:08:24.545 --> 01:08:26.312
How high is her fever?

01:08:28.743 --> 01:08:30.411
You can't pick her up?

01:08:30.444 --> 01:08:32.279
Yes, I'm on my way.

01:08:34.810 --> 01:08:35.845
Thank you for the coffee.

01:08:37.911 --> 01:08:38.944
I'll be in touch.

01:08:49.911 --> 01:08:52.511
I'd appreciate you
being straight with me.

01:08:53.711 --> 01:08:54.645
I need to know.

01:08:54.678 --> 01:08:55.911
I'll do my best.

01:09:01.511 --> 01:09:03.978
I've never seen
anyone more obsessed

01:09:04.010 --> 01:09:06.845
with finding an escape
from his own fate.

01:09:06.877 --> 01:09:08.479
Is there a way I can help?

01:09:09.643 --> 01:09:11.544
If I may, perhaps
I can accompany you

01:09:11.578 --> 01:09:14.312
to your next destination
and document the event.

01:09:19.010 --> 01:09:20.479
Okay, sure.

01:09:20.511 --> 01:09:22.279
I think that would be fine.

01:09:23.977 --> 01:09:26.411
Just promise me one thing.

01:09:26.444 --> 01:09:28.778
If things don't work out here,

01:09:28.810 --> 01:09:30.911
you'll talk to a
different kind of doctor.

01:09:30.943 --> 01:09:32.777
I know a very good one at home.

01:09:34.544 --> 01:09:35.911
Now, eat.

01:09:39.943 --> 01:09:42.245
Sorry, it's my assistant.

01:09:43.377 --> 01:09:44.644
Hello?

01:09:44.678 --> 01:09:45.911
Jamie?

01:09:45.944 --> 01:09:47.978
Detective Roberts was just here.

01:09:48.011 --> 01:09:49.944
She knows you're in the Azores,

01:09:49.977 --> 01:09:51.910
she says Renata's there too.

01:09:51.944 --> 01:09:53.345
Uh huh.

01:09:53.377 --> 01:09:54.278
Renata's involved
with some investors

01:09:54.312 --> 01:09:55.878
linked to the Carlisle Group.

01:09:55.910 --> 01:09:57.444
I looked them up.

01:09:57.478 --> 01:09:59.945
We're talking U.S.
Department of Defense here.

01:09:59.977 --> 01:10:00.778
Did she tell you that?

01:10:00.810 --> 01:10:02.544
Not exactly, I had
to look at her notes

01:10:02.576 --> 01:10:03.811
while she was distracted.

01:10:04.811 --> 01:10:05.845
I see.

01:10:05.877 --> 01:10:06.877
Jamie, are you okay?

01:10:06.911 --> 01:10:07.745
You sound funny.

01:10:08.643 --> 01:10:10.511
I'll call you later, Marc.

01:10:10.544 --> 01:10:11.379
Thanks.

01:10:36.978 --> 01:10:37.778
Hi.

01:10:37.810 --> 01:10:38.611
Hi.

01:10:39.910 --> 01:10:42.644
Two toste mista's to go, please.

01:10:42.678 --> 01:10:44.279
Two?

01:10:44.312 --> 01:10:46.279
So, you found a new friend

01:10:46.311 --> 01:10:47.945
to spend your time
on the island?

01:10:49.577 --> 01:10:51.878
I'm just looking for an old one.

01:10:51.911 --> 01:10:52.912
Okay.

01:10:56.843 --> 01:10:58.478
Do you want them warmed up?

01:10:58.511 --> 01:10:59.543
No, thanks.

01:10:59.577 --> 01:11:00.346
Okay.

01:11:02.910 --> 01:11:05.446
Uh, a bottle of wine, please.

01:11:06.344 --> 01:11:06.979
Sure.

01:11:17.477 --> 01:11:18.379
Thank you.

01:11:18.412 --> 01:11:19.312
Obrigada.

01:11:20.543 --> 01:11:21.545
Enjoy your picnic.

01:11:23.878 --> 01:11:24.712
- Ciao.
- Ciao.

01:11:57.476 --> 01:11:58.711
Shit.

01:12:29.544 --> 01:12:30.645
Bon dia.

01:12:32.644 --> 01:12:34.045
Porto Formoso Beach?

01:12:34.077 --> 01:12:35.710
Porto Formoso...

01:12:43.411 --> 01:12:44.845
Okay, obrigada.

01:13:24.744 --> 01:13:26.912
Fuck, where's the beach?

01:13:41.376 --> 01:13:43.778
I'm so sorry, about everything!

01:13:47.377 --> 01:13:49.377
I'm so lost without you.

01:14:15.610 --> 01:14:17.510
Oh, finally!

01:15:06.343 --> 01:15:07.377
Cheers to us.

01:15:12.577 --> 01:15:14.310
God, the drive up
here was a bitch.

01:15:14.344 --> 01:15:17.378
I'm so tired of
sitting in traffic.

01:15:17.410 --> 01:15:18.510
Why didn't you ride?

01:15:19.710 --> 01:15:22.377
I just feel so tired
all the time lately.

01:15:22.411 --> 01:15:23.577
No.

01:15:23.611 --> 01:15:24.411
You're not having any?

01:15:24.443 --> 01:15:25.410
I'm starving.

01:15:25.444 --> 01:15:27.979
Oh, well, dinner is served.

01:15:29.678 --> 01:15:30.911
Oh.

01:15:30.944 --> 01:15:32.310
What?

01:15:32.344 --> 01:15:33.979
Well, you said you'd
make something special.

01:15:34.910 --> 01:15:36.310
Well, I got your favorite sushi.

01:15:36.344 --> 01:15:37.845
Special number three.

01:15:37.878 --> 01:15:38.945
Forget it.

01:15:38.977 --> 01:15:41.377
I'll just make myself a tea
or sandwich or something.

01:15:41.411 --> 01:15:42.445
You sure?

01:15:44.411 --> 01:15:46.445
You know, they got
wonderful teas in Geneva.

01:15:51.678 --> 01:15:52.612
Jamie, I'm sorry.

01:15:53.778 --> 01:15:54.944
I got caught up with
my work upstairs,

01:15:54.978 --> 01:15:56.978
and I burnt the lasagna
during it, look.

01:15:58.310 --> 01:15:59.477
Great.

01:15:59.510 --> 01:16:01.645
Another casualty of your
scientific research.

01:16:02.644 --> 01:16:03.877
What's gotten into you?

01:16:08.611 --> 01:16:09.445
I'm pregnant.

01:16:11.810 --> 01:16:12.644
What?

01:16:14.576 --> 01:16:16.644
But I thought you couldn't.

01:16:19.511 --> 01:16:20.345
Well...

01:16:23.811 --> 01:16:25.612
Are you sure it's not a mistake?

01:16:28.311 --> 01:16:29.845
Well, I can tell
you wish it was.

01:16:31.744 --> 01:16:33.411
Don't worry, I'll
take care of it.

01:16:33.444 --> 01:16:37.410
No, but I mean isn't it
physically impossible?

01:16:37.444 --> 01:16:38.378
Isn't that what the doctor said?

01:16:38.411 --> 01:16:40.844
Well, I guess science
can be wrong sometimes,

01:16:40.878 --> 01:16:43.478
that's hard for you
to believe, isn't it?

01:16:43.510 --> 01:16:46.944
I'm sorry, I know that I'm
saying the wrong things.

01:16:47.844 --> 01:16:49.545
It just comes as such a shock.

01:16:51.044 --> 01:16:51.845
A baby.

01:16:51.877 --> 01:16:53.343
No baby.

01:16:53.376 --> 01:16:54.378
What?

01:16:54.410 --> 01:16:55.011
I'm not keeping it.

01:16:55.044 --> 01:16:56.443
Wait, what?

01:16:56.476 --> 01:16:57.945
You can't even leave
your research long enough

01:16:57.978 --> 01:17:00.578
to keep a frozen
lasagna from burning.

01:17:00.610 --> 01:17:02.945
You're moving to Geneva.

01:17:02.977 --> 01:17:03.910
It can't happen.

01:17:03.944 --> 01:17:04.778
Jamie, listen.

01:17:06.045 --> 01:17:07.511
Please.

01:17:07.544 --> 01:17:08.578
And you got sashimi?

01:17:09.911 --> 01:17:11.344
I hate sashimi!

01:17:15.477 --> 01:17:16.444
Where are you going?

01:17:16.477 --> 01:17:17.544
Right into the office.

01:17:17.577 --> 01:17:18.578
I gotta meet Renata.

01:17:20.443 --> 01:17:23.278
Great, so you were gonna
leave after dinner anyway?

01:17:28.943 --> 01:17:31.510
You're gonna ride all
the way out there?

01:17:48.511 --> 01:17:49.445
Isaac, can you hear me?

01:17:51.510 --> 01:17:52.744
I know you wanted me
to keep this baby,

01:17:52.777 --> 01:17:53.944
but I'm not so sure.

01:17:56.045 --> 01:17:58.012
I can't even keep my
own shit together.

01:18:00.576 --> 01:18:02.278
What the hell am I doing here?

01:18:04.544 --> 01:18:05.578
Jamie.

01:18:06.476 --> 01:18:07.744
Oh my God, Isaac?

01:18:09.311 --> 01:18:10.544
Please don't leave this time.

01:18:12.510 --> 01:18:13.945
This is temporary.

01:18:13.978 --> 01:18:16.511
You have to decide if
you want to crossover.

01:18:17.577 --> 01:18:18.611
I do.

01:18:18.643 --> 01:18:20.577
I'll send you the
exact coordinates.

01:18:20.610 --> 01:18:21.810
The planes are
consistently shifting,

01:18:21.844 --> 01:18:24.278
so you'll only have a
small window to cross.

01:18:24.311 --> 01:18:25.545
I'll be waiting for you.

01:18:26.277 --> 01:18:29.543
But why can't you just
stay here with me?

01:18:29.577 --> 01:18:30.511
Nobody knows you.

01:18:30.544 --> 01:18:31.378
Exactly.

01:18:33.343 --> 01:18:34.944
I'm nothing here.

01:18:36.544 --> 01:18:40.510
But in my timeline, my
research, this discovery?

01:18:40.544 --> 01:18:41.643
It's huge.

01:18:41.678 --> 01:18:44.478
Bringing you on to my plane
would give me a Nobel Prize,

01:18:44.510 --> 01:18:45.577
and so much more.

01:18:46.578 --> 01:18:49.445
But if I crossed over,
isn't there another Jamie?

01:18:52.310 --> 01:18:53.745
This hasn't been easy, you know.

01:18:53.777 --> 01:18:56.543
Finding you, so similar,

01:18:56.577 --> 01:18:58.845
but making such different
choices at the end?

01:19:00.577 --> 01:19:02.577
That night that we fought,

01:19:02.611 --> 01:19:05.344
you rode your bike over to
my place instead of driving.

01:19:05.377 --> 01:19:07.311
You rode and I drove after you.

01:19:08.476 --> 01:19:11.577
In my timeline,
it was you that...

01:19:16.843 --> 01:19:18.543
Well, just imagine
how they'll all react

01:19:18.577 --> 01:19:20.510
when I bring you
back from the dead.

01:19:22.843 --> 01:19:24.411
Oh, you think you're God.

01:19:25.544 --> 01:19:26.911
I'm just making
good on our promise.

01:19:26.944 --> 01:19:29.510
But how do you know?

01:19:29.544 --> 01:19:31.245
'Cause I made it to you.

01:19:32.476 --> 01:19:33.377
But-

01:19:33.411 --> 01:19:34.577
I've observed so many timelines,

01:19:34.611 --> 01:19:37.611
and you're the closest
to her, and I'm to him.

01:19:37.644 --> 01:19:39.478
I am him.

01:19:39.511 --> 01:19:40.778
Your Isaac.

01:19:40.810 --> 01:19:43.343
And I've dedicated my
life to finding you.

01:19:43.376 --> 01:19:44.778
Even after they pulled
the plug on my work,

01:19:44.811 --> 01:19:47.478
I went underground to
continue my research.

01:19:47.510 --> 01:19:48.911
The work in your notebook?

01:19:49.778 --> 01:19:50.845
That was the start.

01:19:51.943 --> 01:19:53.677
But I gave that to Renata.

01:19:55.743 --> 01:19:57.710
It might buy her some time.

01:19:57.744 --> 01:19:59.311
She was frightened
of the implications,

01:19:59.344 --> 01:20:01.378
she wanted to put a
moratorium on our research.

01:20:02.577 --> 01:20:04.577
I don't
know who to trust.

01:20:04.611 --> 01:20:05.577
There's no X.

01:20:07.677 --> 01:20:09.678
You have to decide for yourself.

01:20:11.644 --> 01:20:12.845
I don't have much time left.

01:20:14.744 --> 01:20:16.578
But what if I can't do this?

01:20:16.610 --> 01:20:18.378
Why in the middle of the ocean?

01:20:19.410 --> 01:20:20.310
How did you know?

01:20:20.343 --> 01:20:21.845
You whispered it to me.

01:20:21.877 --> 01:20:23.543
I mean, I've seen a
whole bunch of stuff,

01:20:23.576 --> 01:20:25.343
of you, and me, we're-

01:20:25.377 --> 01:20:26.645
Your mind has become aware,

01:20:26.678 --> 01:20:29.610
and it stopped editing
out inconsistencies.

01:20:29.644 --> 01:20:32.010
You're remembering and
experiencing other timelines

01:20:32.044 --> 01:20:33.411
as they converge with this one,

01:20:33.444 --> 01:20:34.711
other choices you've made.

01:20:34.743 --> 01:20:38.577
But right now you have
to focus on this one.

01:20:38.610 --> 01:20:40.777
The jump has to be made at
precisely the right place

01:20:40.810 --> 01:20:42.378
at precisely the right time.

01:20:43.444 --> 01:20:46.511
A place where this timeline
can converge onto others.

01:20:46.544 --> 01:20:47.344
Which others?

01:20:47.377 --> 01:20:47.978
The ones...

01:20:51.476 --> 01:20:52.910
Where you take your
life in the ocean.

01:20:53.977 --> 01:20:54.910
What?

01:20:54.942 --> 01:20:55.944
Otherwise it might cause a rift.

01:20:57.010 --> 01:20:59.511
By myself in the ocean?

01:21:02.942 --> 01:21:05.910
You'll have to rent a boat,
so that you're prepared.

01:21:07.076 --> 01:21:08.578
But what if I can't do this?

01:21:09.877 --> 01:21:11.611
You'll come to the water.

01:21:11.644 --> 01:21:12.811
You always do.

01:21:12.843 --> 01:21:13.644
What?

01:21:13.677 --> 01:21:14.909
You'll know what to do.

01:21:14.943 --> 01:21:15.778
What?

01:21:19.743 --> 01:21:20.777
Isaac!

01:21:23.778 --> 01:21:24.911
Stop!

01:21:26.511 --> 01:21:27.544
Jamie, don't!

01:21:28.644 --> 01:21:30.411
What are you doing here?

01:21:30.443 --> 01:21:31.877
I couldn't ignore
the possibility

01:21:31.909 --> 01:21:34.044
that Isaac might've
figured it out.

01:21:34.076 --> 01:21:35.043
I had to come here.

01:21:35.076 --> 01:21:37.510
I documented the whole thing.

01:21:37.543 --> 01:21:38.478
Then you saw him!

01:21:39.643 --> 01:21:40.744
I wish I had.

01:21:41.743 --> 01:21:42.577
Here.

01:21:43.510 --> 01:21:44.677
Look.

01:21:44.710 --> 01:21:45.943
There's no Isaac there.

01:21:48.777 --> 01:21:51.644
But what if I was in
two places at the same time?

01:21:51.678 --> 01:21:53.044
Why don't you believe me?

01:21:53.076 --> 01:21:54.876
I'm a scientist.

01:21:54.909 --> 01:21:56.577
I needed verification.

01:21:59.476 --> 01:22:00.876
Then why try
to stop the research?

01:22:00.910 --> 01:22:02.378
Because we couldn't be sure

01:22:02.410 --> 01:22:04.610
what these investors
might do with it.

01:22:04.644 --> 01:22:06.478
There were hints that
their application

01:22:06.511 --> 01:22:07.909
might be problematic.

01:22:07.943 --> 01:22:10.711
More than problematic,
actually, catastrophic.

01:22:10.744 --> 01:22:12.778
Isaac wouldn't hurt anybody!

01:22:12.810 --> 01:22:15.343
Not intentionally, no.

01:22:15.377 --> 01:22:17.278
But he wanted it all.

01:22:17.310 --> 01:22:20.277
He wanted everything,
fast and furious, his way.

01:22:23.710 --> 01:22:24.777
You're wrong.

01:22:26.377 --> 01:22:27.011
Jamie.

01:22:28.343 --> 01:22:29.510
You're exhausted.

01:22:30.677 --> 01:22:33.710
You haven't eaten in
days, chasing a ghost.

01:22:33.744 --> 01:22:36.811
I mean, the stress is
playing tricks on your mind.

01:22:37.777 --> 01:22:38.810
Don't help me.

01:22:41.810 --> 01:22:43.810
Just leave me the fuck alone!

01:22:53.677 --> 01:22:55.810
Detective Roberts, what's up?

01:22:55.842 --> 01:22:57.310
Well, your
fingerprints came back

01:22:57.344 --> 01:22:58.876
on the boxes in Isaac's office,

01:22:58.910 --> 01:23:01.378
and his family had
already changed the locks.

01:23:01.410 --> 01:23:02.844
I'm not sure that
stealing an old sweatshirt

01:23:02.876 --> 01:23:04.043
and a marked up map

01:23:04.076 --> 01:23:05.809
qualifies as an
indictable offense.

01:23:05.842 --> 01:23:08.611
Both you and Renata are
together on the same island?

01:23:09.776 --> 01:23:11.010
Don't tell me that's
just coincidence.

01:23:11.043 --> 01:23:12.745
It's okay, Detective.

01:23:12.776 --> 01:23:15.277
Your number one suspect won't
be a problem for much longer.

01:23:16.743 --> 01:23:18.444
What are you saying?

01:23:18.476 --> 01:23:20.843
You'll be able to
close the case very soon.

01:23:23.077 --> 01:23:26.811
Jamie, are you thinking
of doing something?

01:23:27.909 --> 01:23:29.776
Please, that's not the answer.

01:23:29.809 --> 01:23:30.643
I'm done here, don't worry.

01:23:30.678 --> 01:23:33.777
Look, Jamie, I saw
your medical records.

01:23:33.809 --> 01:23:37.543
I know about your mother,
about your condition.

01:23:37.577 --> 01:23:38.777
I should go.

01:23:38.809 --> 01:23:40.410
Jamie, it's the best
thing I've ever done!

01:23:41.943 --> 01:23:43.611
What?

01:23:43.643 --> 01:23:45.043
Being a parent.

01:23:45.076 --> 01:23:48.411
When you asked me before,
and I told you it was hard,

01:23:49.776 --> 01:23:50.810
that's true.

01:23:51.844 --> 01:23:55.544
But it's also the best thing
that ever happened in my life.

01:23:55.577 --> 01:23:56.744
Really?

01:23:56.777 --> 01:23:57.777
Yes, absolutely.

01:23:59.410 --> 01:24:01.245
I'm sorry I pushed you too hard.

01:24:03.577 --> 01:24:04.411
You can tell me.

01:24:05.977 --> 01:24:07.411
I want to help.

01:24:07.444 --> 01:24:08.578
Tell you what?

01:24:09.742 --> 01:24:10.976
There's fresh damage

01:24:11.009 --> 01:24:12.345
on the front left
side of your car.

01:24:13.742 --> 01:24:15.577
If it was an accident,
you wouldn't be at fault.

01:24:18.043 --> 01:24:18.876
Jamie?

01:24:20.776 --> 01:24:21.810
Jamie?

01:24:22.876 --> 01:24:23.776
Are you there?

01:24:42.576 --> 01:24:44.644
Momma, I can't breathe.

01:24:48.810 --> 01:24:49.911
I'm drowning.

01:24:53.476 --> 01:24:55.611
I have this heavy
rock on my chest.

01:24:58.344 --> 01:25:00.277
I'm scared that I'm losing him.

01:25:07.942 --> 01:25:09.310
Us Irving women,

01:25:09.343 --> 01:25:11.743
we were not cut out for
motherhood, were we?

01:26:13.943 --> 01:26:14.978
Over here?

01:26:16.410 --> 01:26:17.310
Yeah.

01:26:17.343 --> 01:26:18.278
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:26:18.310 --> 01:26:18.943
Okay.

01:26:44.444 --> 01:26:45.278
Isaac!

01:27:22.044 --> 01:27:23.944
Help me, somebody help!

01:27:24.877 --> 01:27:26.510
Somebody help me!

01:29:40.044 --> 01:29:40.876
Isaac!

01:32:19.609 --> 01:32:20.910
Isaac's gone!

01:32:21.942 --> 01:32:22.776
He's gone!

01:32:23.976 --> 01:32:26.010
I couldn't give up my
life to meet with him,

01:32:26.044 --> 01:32:27.477
I couldn't do it!

01:32:28.842 --> 01:32:30.611
He's not coming back.

01:32:34.077 --> 01:32:36.644
I thought it was Madeleine.

01:32:36.676 --> 01:32:38.342
I thought you were Madeleine,

01:32:38.375 --> 01:32:40.510
I thought you were her.

01:32:41.475 --> 01:32:45.476
I saw the waves, and I thought
you were her, oh my god.

01:32:48.709 --> 01:32:51.376
It was supposed to be her.

01:32:51.410 --> 01:32:54.711
Miguel, I don't think
she's coming back.

01:32:57.977 --> 01:32:58.777
It's okay.

01:33:00.475 --> 01:33:01.811
It's gonna be okay.

01:33:29.877 --> 01:33:31.542
You know I don't have much time.

01:33:31.576 --> 01:33:33.643
Well, I figured you'd
rather do this in person

01:33:33.677 --> 01:33:34.843
and not over the phone.

01:33:36.043 --> 01:33:36.943
Always.

01:33:38.342 --> 01:33:40.576
You probably noticed
a page was missing.

01:33:42.543 --> 01:33:43.444
I want you to have it.

01:33:48.777 --> 01:33:51.677
The diagram
for building the device.

01:33:51.709 --> 01:33:54.276
When you build it, find him,

01:33:55.476 --> 01:33:56.843
and let him know
I know it was him

01:33:56.877 --> 01:33:58.310
that caused the accident.

01:33:59.410 --> 01:34:00.410
He always does.

01:34:01.642 --> 01:34:04.744
I was driving the car,
but he stepped out.

01:34:07.077 --> 01:34:08.410
You have to stop him.

01:34:09.976 --> 01:34:12.576
I can't bring his baby
into the world otherwise.

01:34:28.676 --> 01:34:29.776
Where are you going?

01:34:31.910 --> 01:34:34.443
There's one more
place I need to visit.

01:34:34.475 --> 01:34:35.944
From his map?

01:34:35.977 --> 01:34:36.811
No.

01:34:38.010 --> 01:34:38.844
From mine.
