00:07.883 --> 00:10.010
I got one!

00:18.101 --> 00:20.061
Yes, yes. Cool.

00:20.103 --> 00:22.648
Get him!

00:22.690 --> 00:24.900
Ugh.

00:30.322 --> 00:32.574
I got one!

01:10.863 --> 01:12.740
MALCOLM:

01:10.863 --> 01:12.740
Okay, give me the tape.

01:12.781 --> 01:14.115
What if we get caught?

01:14.157 --> 01:15.534
Don't worry about it.

01:14.157 --> 01:15.534
No one's home.

01:15.576 --> 01:18.078
I cued it up

01:15.576 --> 01:18.078
to the best part.

01:20.414 --> 01:22.958
ANNOUNCER:

01:20.414 --> 01:22.958
It's BattleBots,

01:23.000 --> 01:25.961
and it's a free for all

01:23.000 --> 01:25.961
at the battle area.

01:26.003 --> 01:27.295
All of these heavyweight..

01:27.337 --> 01:28.964
I thought this was porno.

01:29.006 --> 01:31.050
Ew. No, this

01:29.006 --> 01:31.050
is better.

01:31.090 --> 01:33.594
And no one's...

01:31.090 --> 01:33.594
excluded.

01:33.635 --> 01:35.679
Come on, this is

01:33.635 --> 01:35.679
the lamest thing I've...

01:38.557 --> 01:40.392
Oh, my God, is that real?

01:40.434 --> 01:42.143
It's an open

01:40.434 --> 01:42.143
competition.

01:42.185 --> 01:43.938
People build killer robots,

01:42.185 --> 01:43.938
put them in a ring,

01:43.979 --> 01:46.065
and see which one

01:43.979 --> 01:46.065
comes out alive.

01:46.105 --> 01:47.148
Killer robots?!

01:47.190 --> 01:48.358
I can't believe it.

01:48.400 --> 01:51.236
Finally something cool

01:48.400 --> 01:51.236
about being smart.

01:51.278 --> 01:53.113
I wish we could do that.

01:54.448 --> 01:56.450
We were hoping you'd say that.

01:56.491 --> 01:57.618
Here's the deal:

01:57.659 --> 01:59.202
we want to enter

01:57.659 --> 01:59.202
the competition.

01:59.244 --> 02:01.663
We've got the designs,

01:59.244 --> 02:01.663
we've got the desire,

02:01.705 --> 02:04.332
and we're not distracted

02:01.705 --> 02:04.332
by any kind of social life.

02:04.374 --> 02:07.168
The only problem is that our

02:04.374 --> 02:07.168
parents would never allow us

02:07.210 --> 02:08.879
to build something

02:07.210 --> 02:08.879
that dangerous.

02:08.921 --> 02:10.380
That means we need a place

02:10.422 --> 02:12.466
with a total lack

02:10.422 --> 02:12.466
of caring adult supervision.

02:12.507 --> 02:15.302
That's my house!

02:16.845 --> 02:20.015
But those things look

02:16.845 --> 02:20.015
really expensive.

02:20.057 --> 02:21.182
No problem.

02:21.224 --> 02:23.268
My father tries

02:21.224 --> 02:23.268
to buy my love.

02:23.310 --> 02:25.145
(boys cheer)

02:26.855 --> 02:29.775
Who's your... daddy?

02:29.817 --> 02:32.193
Push.

02:29.817 --> 02:32.193
What are

02:29.817 --> 02:32.193
the odds, huh?

02:32.235 --> 02:34.195
Of Francis having

02:32.235 --> 02:34.195
an emergency appendectomy

02:34.237 --> 02:37.574
two months after using

02:34.237 --> 02:37.574
the same excuse to ditch school?

02:37.616 --> 02:39.284
Well, he was never very lucky.

02:39.326 --> 02:40.828
Oh, I need you

02:39.326 --> 02:40.828
to call work

02:40.869 --> 02:42.412
and tell them I

02:40.869 --> 02:42.412
won't be coming in.

02:42.454 --> 02:43.455
Will do.

02:42.454 --> 02:43.455
(car horn honks)

02:43.497 --> 02:45.707
Well, there's my cab.

02:52.297 --> 02:53.715
What's that all about?

02:53.757 --> 02:55.884
A little something

02:53.757 --> 02:55.884
to remember me by.

02:55.926 --> 02:57.594
You know, it just

02:55.926 --> 02:57.594
occurred to me

02:57.636 --> 03:00.221
that we have not been apart

02:57.636 --> 03:00.221
for one night in 18 years.

03:00.263 --> 03:01.640
You gonna be

03:00.263 --> 03:01.640
okay with that?

03:01.682 --> 03:03.684
(imitating baby):

03:01.682 --> 03:03.684
I think I can manage

03:03.725 --> 03:05.686
without my mommy

03:03.725 --> 03:05.686
for a few days.

03:05.727 --> 03:07.729
I told you that baby

03:05.727 --> 03:07.729
voice creeps me out.

03:07.771 --> 03:09.648
Sorry.

03:11.274 --> 03:13.276
Ten-hut!

03:11.274 --> 03:13.276
Well, Cadet,

03:13.318 --> 03:15.821
I see you survived.

03:13.318 --> 03:15.821
Yes, sir.

03:15.863 --> 03:17.405
I brought you

03:15.863 --> 03:17.405
a little something

03:17.447 --> 03:19.867
to take your mind

03:17.447 --> 03:19.867
off the pain.

03:19.908 --> 03:21.743
This is a good

03:19.908 --> 03:21.743
opportunity for you

03:21.785 --> 03:23.453
to catch up

03:21.785 --> 03:23.453
on your homework.

03:23.495 --> 03:25.246
Take it from me--

03:25.288 --> 03:28.125
a lengthy hospital stay

03:25.288 --> 03:28.125
is the perfect environment

03:28.167 --> 03:31.461
to focus your mind and attack

03:28.167 --> 03:31.461
weaknesses in your character.

03:31.503 --> 03:33.254
If it hadn't been

03:31.503 --> 03:33.254
for this,

03:33.296 --> 03:36.216
I never would've learned

03:33.296 --> 03:36.216
conversational French.

03:37.551 --> 03:39.511
Carry on.

03:41.304 --> 03:43.182
Sorry, man.

03:43.223 --> 03:45.266
I was this close

03:43.223 --> 03:45.266
to going medieval on him.

03:45.308 --> 03:46.643
You feeling okay?

03:46.685 --> 03:49.270
I feel like I have a belly

03:46.685 --> 03:49.270
full of broken glass.

03:49.312 --> 03:52.273
Every time I breathe in, I

03:49.312 --> 03:52.273
almost pass out from the pain.

03:52.315 --> 03:54.193
This is the single

03:52.315 --> 03:54.193
greatest thing

03:54.234 --> 03:55.861
that has ever

03:54.234 --> 03:55.861
happened to me.

03:55.903 --> 03:58.279
What?

03:55.903 --> 03:58.279
Well, for as long

03:55.903 --> 03:58.279
as I can remember,

03:58.321 --> 04:00.365
my mom has been

03:58.321 --> 04:00.365
torturing me with guilt.

04:00.407 --> 04:03.660
I've never been able to fight

04:00.407 --> 04:03.660
back, but this is perfect.

04:03.702 --> 04:08.123
Her first-born child almost dies

04:03.702 --> 04:08.123
a thousand miles from home,

04:08.165 --> 04:10.125
and she's the one

04:08.165 --> 04:10.125
who sent me here.

04:10.167 --> 04:12.920
She can't dismiss it,

04:10.167 --> 04:12.920
she can't argue about it,

04:12.961 --> 04:15.005
she can't twist it around

04:12.961 --> 04:15.005
and make it my fault.

04:15.047 --> 04:16.339
It's beautiful.

04:16.381 --> 04:18.884
(groans)

04:16.381 --> 04:18.884
Dude, you almost died.

04:18.926 --> 04:21.302
I want you to say that

04:18.926 --> 04:21.302
again when she gets here.

04:21.344 --> 04:24.556
Oh, this poor woman has no

04:21.344 --> 04:24.556
idea what she's walking into.

04:25.724 --> 04:27.308
Okay, Mom's only gonna be gone

04:27.350 --> 04:30.311
for about four or five days,

04:27.350 --> 04:30.311
so we have to prioritize.

04:30.353 --> 04:32.147
What are you asking Dad for?

04:32.189 --> 04:33.565
I want to wear

04:32.189 --> 04:33.565
my pajamas to school.

04:33.607 --> 04:35.316
I'm getting a scope

04:33.607 --> 04:35.316
for my BB gun.

04:35.358 --> 04:36.610
You don't have a BB gun.

04:36.651 --> 04:39.196
Not yet.

04:39.238 --> 04:41.364
Okay, but since I'm asking

04:39.238 --> 04:41.364
to build a killer robot,

04:41.406 --> 04:42.407
I should go first.

04:42.449 --> 04:44.243
Why?

04:44.284 --> 04:46.120
Because anything

04:44.284 --> 04:46.120
after "killer robot"

04:46.161 --> 04:47.287
is gonna sound reasonable.

04:48.747 --> 04:50.498
Dad?

04:50.540 --> 04:51.917
Yeah.

04:51.959 --> 04:53.543
A couple friends and

04:51.959 --> 04:53.543
I want to explore

04:53.585 --> 04:55.503
our engineering and

04:53.585 --> 04:55.503
machining skills.

04:55.545 --> 04:56.838
Sounds great.

04:56.880 --> 04:59.340
So, um, you think

04:56.880 --> 04:59.340
it'd be all right

04:59.382 --> 05:02.343
if a bunch of Krelboynes and I

04:59.382 --> 05:02.343
build a robot in the house?

05:02.385 --> 05:04.179
Yeah, fine.

05:04.221 --> 05:06.306
Whoa, that was

05:04.221 --> 05:06.306
easy, even for him.

05:07.390 --> 05:09.350
(pounding on door)

05:09.392 --> 05:11.394
HAL:

05:09.392 --> 05:11.394
For crying out loud.

05:11.436 --> 05:13.354
Be strong.

05:15.023 --> 05:16.399
Lois will get through

05:15.023 --> 05:16.399
her operation.

05:16.441 --> 05:17.818
She is a fighter.

05:17.859 --> 05:19.611
No, no, Craig,

05:17.859 --> 05:19.611
it was Francis.

05:19.653 --> 05:21.362
Oh, my God.

05:21.404 --> 05:22.656
Did he shoot her?

05:22.697 --> 05:23.824
I knew it.

05:23.865 --> 05:26.243
I t-told her

05:23.865 --> 05:26.243
to stay away from him.

05:26.285 --> 05:28.245
That boy has been

05:26.285 --> 05:28.245
nothing but trouble.

05:28.287 --> 05:31.206
Uh, Craig, uh, Lois did

05:28.287 --> 05:31.206
not have an operation.

05:31.248 --> 05:32.874
Our son Francis did.

05:32.916 --> 05:37.045
Sh-She just went down to Alabama

05:32.916 --> 05:37.045
to look after him for a while.

05:38.421 --> 05:39.589
Oh.

05:39.631 --> 05:41.633
Well, tell Lois

05:39.631 --> 05:41.633
I stopped by.

05:43.260 --> 05:46.263
I can't believe my mom missed

05:43.260 --> 05:46.263
them putting my catheter in.

05:46.305 --> 05:47.806
Maybe I should take it out

05:47.848 --> 05:49.474
so they can reinsert it

05:47.848 --> 05:49.474
when she gets here.

05:49.516 --> 05:51.392
Or maybe you could,

05:51.434 --> 05:54.896
I don't know, shut up about

05:51.434 --> 05:54.896
your mom for half a second.

05:54.938 --> 05:56.773
No one's that bad.

05:56.815 --> 05:59.484
Hey, I been sugar-coating it

05:56.815 --> 05:59.484
for you 'cause you're enfeebled.

05:59.526 --> 06:00.861
LOIS:

05:59.526 --> 06:00.861
Francis!

06:00.902 --> 06:02.403
But you can just see

06:00.902 --> 06:02.403
for yourself.

06:02.445 --> 06:04.656
Hi, honey.

06:04.698 --> 06:06.700
You look terrible.

06:06.741 --> 06:09.410
(weakly): You think that's

06:06.741 --> 06:09.410
gonna appease your guilt?

06:09.452 --> 06:10.620
What guilt?

06:10.662 --> 06:12.622
Boy, it's stuffy in here.

06:12.664 --> 06:14.833
That can't be good for you.

06:14.875 --> 06:16.084
You look pasty.

06:16.126 --> 06:17.669
Have you had a

06:16.126 --> 06:17.669
bowel movement?

06:17.711 --> 06:19.796
When is the last time

06:17.711 --> 06:19.796
you moved your bowels?

06:17.711 --> 06:19.796
Mom...

06:19.838 --> 06:21.006
Hello.

06:21.048 --> 06:22.924
Who are you?

06:22.966 --> 06:25.844
Edwin Spangler-- I am commandant

06:22.966 --> 06:25.844
of Marlin Academy.

06:25.886 --> 06:27.888
Good for you.

06:27.929 --> 06:29.681
Where's your eye?

06:29.723 --> 06:30.682
Pardon?

06:30.724 --> 06:32.351
Do your ears work?

06:32.391 --> 06:34.144
Do you have some business

06:32.391 --> 06:34.144
with my son?

06:34.186 --> 06:35.687
He needs to rest.

06:35.729 --> 06:38.439
Well, I stopped by to pick up

06:35.729 --> 06:38.439
your boy's homework.

06:38.481 --> 06:40.525
Homework?! You're not

06:38.481 --> 06:40.525
giving him homework.

06:40.567 --> 06:42.236
My son nearly

06:40.567 --> 06:42.236
lost his life--

06:42.277 --> 06:43.862
something that never

06:42.277 --> 06:43.862
would've happened

06:43.904 --> 06:46.156
if you'd taken proper care

06:43.904 --> 06:46.156
of him in the first place.

06:46.198 --> 06:47.949
Well, I assure you, ma'am,

06:47.991 --> 06:50.702
had it not been for Francis's

06:47.991 --> 06:50.702
long history of crying wolf...

06:50.744 --> 06:52.371
Crying wolf?

06:52.411 --> 06:53.663
You listen to me, you idiot!

06:53.705 --> 06:55.456
My child is sick.

06:55.498 --> 06:58.085
He does not need you

06:55.498 --> 06:58.085
marching in here, puffing up

06:58.126 --> 07:00.461
your little chest

06:58.126 --> 07:00.461
and making his life

07:00.503 --> 07:02.547
more miserable

07:00.503 --> 07:02.547
than it already is.

07:02.589 --> 07:04.465
Why don't you just go play

07:02.589 --> 07:04.465
army man somewhere else?

07:12.432 --> 07:15.435
God, she is magnificent.

07:18.563 --> 07:20.982
Dude, your mom rocks.

07:25.737 --> 07:27.572
(sighs)

07:27.614 --> 07:29.532
(whimpers)

07:38.166 --> 07:40.419
Hmm.

07:46.383 --> 07:48.468
(sighs)

07:51.763 --> 07:53.514
MAN (over TV):

07:51.763 --> 07:53.514
You got a girl, Rizzo?

07:53.556 --> 07:54.933
RIZZO: Yeah, Sarge.

07:53.556 --> 07:54.933
I miss her something awful.

07:54.975 --> 07:56.559
Soon as I get home,

07:54.975 --> 07:56.559
I'm going to marry her.

07:56.601 --> 07:57.685
(gunfire, Rizzo grunts)

07:57.727 --> 07:59.604
MAN:

07:57.727 --> 07:59.604
Rizzo!

08:04.192 --> 08:06.611
We need...

08:04.192 --> 08:06.611
more torque!

08:06.653 --> 08:09.530
No, we need a balance

08:06.653 --> 08:09.530
between speed  and  torque.

08:09.572 --> 08:11.116
This is great.

08:11.158 --> 08:13.452
I can make a huge mess,

08:11.158 --> 08:13.452
build a killer robot,

08:13.493 --> 08:15.329
and Mom's not here

08:13.493 --> 08:15.329
to yell at us.

08:15.370 --> 08:17.538
I don't even mind

08:15.370 --> 08:17.538
having Krelboynes in the house.

08:17.580 --> 08:18.748
Do we all want

08:18.790 --> 08:20.541
a direct, continuous

08:18.790 --> 08:20.541
linear relation

08:20.583 --> 08:21.918
between the rotary actuator

08:21.960 --> 08:24.004
and the robot's

08:21.960 --> 08:24.004
translational displacement,

08:24.045 --> 08:26.173
or am I just some kind

08:24.045 --> 08:26.173
of crazy dreamer?

08:26.214 --> 08:27.632
Well, what about my design for

08:27.674 --> 08:30.177
the polycarbonate body?

08:27.674 --> 08:30.177
STEVIE: It's a...

08:30.218 --> 08:31.345
butterfly.

08:31.386 --> 08:34.139
Correction--

08:31.386 --> 08:34.139
killer butterfly.

08:34.181 --> 08:36.557
Beautiful yet deadly.

08:36.599 --> 08:38.559
The perfect killing machine.

08:38.601 --> 08:40.354
It's too unreliable.

08:40.395 --> 08:42.063
It's got to be more simple,

08:40.395 --> 08:42.063
like a sledgehammer or...

08:42.105 --> 08:43.564
A superheated spike shot

08:42.105 --> 08:43.564
out by power charges.

08:43.606 --> 08:45.025
Yeah, but that's not

08:43.606 --> 08:45.025
going to be easy...

08:45.066 --> 08:47.068
What's this stuff?

08:45.066 --> 08:47.068
(boys gasp)

08:47.110 --> 08:51.031
We were just... sort of...

08:47.110 --> 08:51.031
fooling around with some ideas.

08:51.072 --> 08:53.116
Let's have a look.

08:54.493 --> 08:56.453
Well... I'd go

08:54.493 --> 08:56.453
with the flame thrower.

08:56.495 --> 08:59.289
That would destroy everything

08:56.495 --> 08:59.289
within a ten-foot perimeter.

08:59.331 --> 09:03.377
Of course, a lot to be said

08:59.331 --> 09:03.377
for that high-voltage probe.

09:03.418 --> 09:06.880
Sir, before you continue,

09:03.418 --> 09:06.880
I feel I have to mention

09:06.921 --> 09:09.549
that our parents

09:06.921 --> 09:09.549
strongly disapprove of this.

09:11.009 --> 09:14.471
Sorry. My therapist

09:11.009 --> 09:14.471
says it's a compulsion.

09:14.513 --> 09:16.723
Well, I guess you shouldn't

09:14.513 --> 09:16.723
tell your parents, then.

09:20.643 --> 09:21.853
Wow.

09:21.895 --> 09:24.272
Your father's lack

09:21.895 --> 09:24.272
of responsibility

09:24.314 --> 09:26.607
is both terrifying and...

09:26.649 --> 09:28.360
oddly thrilling.

09:32.239 --> 09:34.699
(humming)

09:34.741 --> 09:37.618
I can't apologize enough for

09:34.741 --> 09:37.618
these barbaric accommodations.

09:37.660 --> 09:39.620
You deserve so much more.

09:39.662 --> 09:41.415
Oh, no, this is fine.

09:41.456 --> 09:43.624
Why  are  all the hotel rooms

09:41.456 --> 09:43.624
booked?

09:43.666 --> 09:46.627
The all-Alabama gay rodeo

09:43.666 --> 09:46.627
is in town again.

09:46.669 --> 09:48.880
Homosexuals riding horses

09:46.669 --> 09:48.880
and such.

09:48.922 --> 09:51.341
It does wonders

09:48.922 --> 09:51.341
for the local economy,

09:51.383 --> 09:54.677
but you have to fight

09:51.383 --> 09:54.677
the crowds for everything.

09:54.719 --> 09:57.638
If you're interested,

09:54.719 --> 09:57.638
I have some passes.

09:57.680 --> 10:00.267
No, thanks.

09:57.680 --> 10:00.267
Another time, then.

10:03.478 --> 10:05.646
Bonsoir.

10:09.276 --> 10:11.069
You know, this

10:09.276 --> 10:11.069
room isn't so bad.

10:11.111 --> 10:14.072
The way you whined about it,

10:11.111 --> 10:14.072
I thought it was going to be

10:14.114 --> 10:16.657
a couple of cots

10:14.114 --> 10:16.657
and a drain in the floor.

10:16.699 --> 10:18.285
What are you doing?

10:16.699 --> 10:18.285
You're stinky.

10:18.326 --> 10:19.660
I'm going to give you

10:18.326 --> 10:19.660
a sponge bath.

10:19.702 --> 10:21.538
You're not

10:19.702 --> 10:21.538
giving me a sponge bath.

10:21.580 --> 10:23.664
Arms up.

10:21.580 --> 10:23.664
(groans)

10:23.706 --> 10:26.667
Just because you had surgery

10:23.706 --> 10:26.667
is no reason to be a pig.

10:26.709 --> 10:28.669
Mom, did you know

10:26.709 --> 10:28.669
that I almost died?

10:28.711 --> 10:30.380
Oh, you did not

10:28.711 --> 10:30.380
almost die.

10:30.422 --> 10:32.340
My appendix burst!

10:32.382 --> 10:34.926
They had to vacuum out

10:32.382 --> 10:34.926
the contents of my intestines.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.719
You could not possibly

10:34.968 --> 10:36.719
comprehend

10:36.761 --> 10:38.888
the pain that I was in--

10:36.761 --> 10:38.888
that I  am  in.

10:38.930 --> 10:41.516
Yeah. I don't know

10:38.930 --> 10:41.516
anything about pain,

10:41.558 --> 10:43.768
what, with four boys

10:41.558 --> 10:43.768
totaling 112 hours of labor--

10:43.810 --> 10:46.062
you being half of

10:43.810 --> 10:46.062
that, I might add.

10:46.104 --> 10:48.689
I'm sorry that I came out

10:46.104 --> 10:48.689
feet first, Mom.

10:48.731 --> 10:49.774
That's okay, honey.

10:49.816 --> 10:51.692
I forgave you years ago.

10:51.734 --> 10:54.362
Oh, God, that tattoo.

10:54.404 --> 10:55.696
I like the tattoo, Mom.

10:55.738 --> 10:58.158
What is it with the men in

10:55.738 --> 10:58.158
this family and tattoos?

10:58.199 --> 10:59.493
(grunts)

10:59.534 --> 11:01.369
Took me five years

10:59.534 --> 11:01.369
to get your father

11:01.411 --> 11:02.703
to burn his off.

11:02.745 --> 11:05.123
What, are you growing

11:02.745 --> 11:05.123
potatoes in there?

11:05.165 --> 11:06.583
Dad had a tattoo?

11:06.625 --> 11:08.585
Yeah, he put a

11:06.625 --> 11:08.585
great big "Lois"

11:08.627 --> 11:10.170
right across

11:08.627 --> 11:10.170
his rear end.

11:10.211 --> 11:12.713
Actually thought I'd

11:10.211 --> 11:12.713
be flattered by it.

11:12.755 --> 11:15.509
That guy was such a

11:12.755 --> 11:15.509
mess when I met him.

11:15.550 --> 11:16.801
Between the motorcycle

11:16.843 --> 11:19.179
and the drinking

11:16.843 --> 11:19.179
and the fighting--

11:19.220 --> 11:21.515
he was so reckless,

11:19.220 --> 11:21.515
it was crazy.

11:21.556 --> 11:23.308
Where do you think

11:21.556 --> 11:23.308
you boys get it from?

11:23.350 --> 11:25.018
Just doesn't sound like Dad.

11:25.059 --> 11:27.145
Yeah, well, that was

11:25.059 --> 11:27.145
a long time ago.

11:27.187 --> 11:29.397
Your father has been

11:27.187 --> 11:29.397
quite a project.

11:29.439 --> 11:32.567
I spent years hounding him

11:29.439 --> 11:32.567
and scolding him

11:32.609 --> 11:34.735
and constantly watching him,

11:34.777 --> 11:36.321
but finally

11:36.363 --> 11:39.616
I got all that rebellion

11:36.363 --> 11:39.616
right out of him.

11:39.658 --> 11:41.576
I can't believe

11:39.658 --> 11:41.576
Dad had a wild side.

11:41.618 --> 11:43.828
Well, someday, you're going

11:41.618 --> 11:43.828
to meet a nice girl.

11:43.870 --> 11:45.913
She's going to do

11:43.870 --> 11:45.913
the same thing for you.

11:45.955 --> 11:47.874
Do your lowers.

11:48.791 --> 11:51.710
(line ringing)

12:14.192 --> 12:15.734
Dad?

12:16.486 --> 12:17.696
Oh, hey, son.

12:17.736 --> 12:19.447
What are you doing?

12:17.736 --> 12:19.447
I just thought

12:19.489 --> 12:21.282
I'd help you kids out

12:19.489 --> 12:21.282
with your robot.

12:21.324 --> 12:23.660
You know, it's amazing how

12:21.324 --> 12:23.660
much you can get accomplished

12:23.702 --> 12:25.078
when you don't sleep at all.

12:25.119 --> 12:27.664
I think we got a little

12:25.119 --> 12:27.664
something up our sleeve

12:27.706 --> 12:28.873
for the competition.

12:28.915 --> 12:30.749
(saw buzzing)

12:39.300 --> 12:40.635
Dad...

12:40.677 --> 12:42.011
I know, it's still

12:40.677 --> 12:42.011
a little slow.

12:42.053 --> 12:44.763
But wait till I put

12:42.053 --> 12:44.763
on the big blade.

12:49.102 --> 12:51.896
MAN (over TV): I eat your heart

12:49.102 --> 12:51.896
and thus avenge my father.

12:51.938 --> 12:54.107
(punches and kicks landing,

12:51.938 --> 12:54.107
men grunting)

12:54.148 --> 12:57.235
Well, we just finished

12:54.148 --> 12:57.235
the 45th and final video

12:57.277 --> 12:58.903
of the  Shaolin Dragon  series.

12:58.945 --> 13:02.156
We are now officially

12:58.945 --> 13:02.156
desensitized to violence.

13:04.451 --> 13:05.910
How many sodas

13:04.451 --> 13:05.910
have you had?

13:05.952 --> 13:08.913
I don't know. I don't

13:05.952 --> 13:08.913
know. I don't know.

13:08.955 --> 13:12.709
Look, I can write

13:08.955 --> 13:12.709
on my tongue.

13:12.751 --> 13:14.461
Well, we can start in on

13:12.751 --> 13:14.461
Monks of Death

13:14.502 --> 13:17.505
or lighten things up with

13:14.502 --> 13:17.505
a little  Samurai Bloodfest.

13:17.547 --> 13:18.797
(knocking on door)

13:21.468 --> 13:22.843
We've had a vote.

13:22.885 --> 13:24.845
We're backing out

13:22.885 --> 13:24.845
of the contest.

13:24.887 --> 13:26.139
What?

13:26.180 --> 13:27.848
Your father

13:26.180 --> 13:27.848
has commandeered this project

13:27.890 --> 13:30.017
and twisted it toward

13:27.890 --> 13:30.017
his own mad ends.

13:30.059 --> 13:32.145
We want our

13:30.059 --> 13:32.145
blueprints back.

13:32.186 --> 13:35.732
We can... do this...

13:35.774 --> 13:39.860
the easy... way...

13:39.902 --> 13:43.114
or... we can...

13:43.156 --> 13:45.533
do this... the hard...

13:45.575 --> 13:47.535
Come on, my dad's

13:45.575 --> 13:47.535
in the backyard.

13:47.577 --> 13:49.996
...way.

13:54.709 --> 13:57.044
(humming quietly)

13:57.086 --> 13:58.254
Dad?

13:58.296 --> 13:59.506
Hey, boys.

13:59.547 --> 14:00.298
Guys want the...

14:00.340 --> 14:01.882
Are you smoking?

14:01.924 --> 14:03.884
Oh, this? No, I'm just...

14:03.926 --> 14:05.386
just playing around.

14:05.428 --> 14:06.929
Listen, don't tell your mom,

14:05.428 --> 14:06.929
okay?

14:06.971 --> 14:08.765
She'd kill me if she found out.

14:08.807 --> 14:10.642
She worked so hard

14:08.807 --> 14:10.642
to get me to stop.

14:11.601 --> 14:14.604
Oh, God, how I

14:11.601 --> 14:14.604
miss that woman.

14:14.646 --> 14:16.981
Um, the guys want

14:14.646 --> 14:16.981
their blueprints back.

14:17.023 --> 14:19.150
Oh, yeah,

14:17.023 --> 14:19.150
they're over there.

14:19.192 --> 14:21.194
I have gone

14:19.192 --> 14:21.194
way past that.

14:21.235 --> 14:23.070
Hey, picture this.

14:23.112 --> 14:25.906
A laser-guided bee cannon.

14:25.948 --> 14:28.284
Bees shot out

14:25.948 --> 14:28.284
with the precision of a laser.

14:28.326 --> 14:29.910
How would that hurt a robot?

14:29.952 --> 14:31.621
Oh, come on, think.

14:31.663 --> 14:32.997
It's not for the robot,

14:33.039 --> 14:35.333
it's for the guy

14:33.039 --> 14:35.333
controlling the robot.

14:35.375 --> 14:37.001
(laughs)

14:37.043 --> 14:38.127
Buzz, zap!

14:38.169 --> 14:39.128
You're going home

14:39.170 --> 14:41.422
with the plaque or ribbon

14:41.464 --> 14:43.883
or whatever crappy award

14:41.464 --> 14:43.883
they give you for winning.

14:44.967 --> 14:46.302
This...

14:46.344 --> 14:50.431
will end... badly.

14:51.558 --> 14:53.017
HAL:

14:51.558 --> 14:53.017
There we go.

14:55.978 --> 14:58.815
(dogs howling in distance)

14:58.857 --> 15:00.900
(howls)

15:02.985 --> 15:04.821
(howls)

15:04.863 --> 15:06.781
I hear you, old fella!

15:06.823 --> 15:07.990
(chuckles)

15:08.032 --> 15:10.201
You're not alone.

15:10.243 --> 15:12.746
(howls)

15:12.787 --> 15:13.996
LOIS: Come on, come on,

15:12.787 --> 15:13.996
do it for mama!

15:14.038 --> 15:16.875
Come on, come on, go!

15:14.038 --> 15:16.875
(cheering)

15:16.916 --> 15:18.959
Aw, come on. You're just

15:16.916 --> 15:18.959
letting me win, aren't you?

15:19.001 --> 15:20.002
I'm really not.

15:20.044 --> 15:21.629
I know. I'm just rubbing it in.

15:21.671 --> 15:22.963
(laughs loudly)

15:23.005 --> 15:26.133
Rubbing it in!

15:26.175 --> 15:28.803
Your mom is great.

15:28.845 --> 15:30.263
This isn't my mom.

15:30.304 --> 15:32.014
It's an act.

15:32.056 --> 15:35.017
It's some kind of freaky mind

15:32.056 --> 15:35.017
game she's playing with me.

15:35.059 --> 15:37.186
Any second now,

15:35.059 --> 15:37.186
her face is going to split open

15:37.228 --> 15:38.563
and she's going

15:37.228 --> 15:38.563
to reveal herself

15:38.605 --> 15:41.816
for the evil banshee

15:38.605 --> 15:41.816
she really is.

15:41.858 --> 15:45.820
Man, I don't know why

15:41.858 --> 15:45.820
she puts up with you.

15:45.862 --> 15:47.822
Anyone for doubles?

15:47.864 --> 15:48.989
Nope.

15:49.031 --> 15:50.283
All right, then.

15:54.078 --> 15:55.996
Oh, hi, honey.

15:54.078 --> 15:55.996
Where you been?

15:56.038 --> 15:57.039
I want you to leave.

15:57.081 --> 15:58.165
What?

15:58.207 --> 15:59.793
I want you to leave.

15:59.834 --> 16:01.001
You made your phony point.

16:01.043 --> 16:02.587
You made me look like an idiot.

16:02.629 --> 16:04.004
Mission accomplished.

16:02.629 --> 16:04.004
Okay.

16:04.046 --> 16:06.173
You know what? I have

16:04.046 --> 16:06.173
had it with you, mister.

16:06.215 --> 16:09.051
You have done nothing but bitch

16:06.215 --> 16:09.051
and moan since I got here,

16:09.093 --> 16:11.220
and I've been nothing

16:09.093 --> 16:11.220
but pleasant.

16:09.093 --> 16:11.220
Exactly!

16:11.262 --> 16:12.806
Oh, what, you complain

16:11.262 --> 16:12.806
when I'm pleasant,

16:12.847 --> 16:13.890
you complain when

16:12.847 --> 16:13.890
I'm not pleasant?

16:13.932 --> 16:14.891
There's no winning with you.

16:14.933 --> 16:16.016
Why don't you just tell me

16:16.058 --> 16:18.018
exactly how you

16:16.058 --> 16:18.018
want me to behave

16:18.060 --> 16:19.813
every second of the day, and

16:18.060 --> 16:19.813
we'll see if that satisfies you.

16:19.854 --> 16:22.064
This isn't fair!

16:19.854 --> 16:22.064
You're taking my pain

16:22.106 --> 16:24.066
and you're twisting it

16:22.106 --> 16:24.066
into your guilt trip!

16:24.108 --> 16:26.653
Fine. Why don't I

16:24.108 --> 16:26.653
just leave, then?

16:26.694 --> 16:28.571
Fine.

16:31.282 --> 16:33.451
(funky dance music playing)

16:35.870 --> 16:37.956
Mom being gone was fun at first,

16:37.997 --> 16:40.458
but this is getting

16:37.997 --> 16:40.458
out of control.

16:41.250 --> 16:43.670
(humming along)

16:43.711 --> 16:45.212
(phone ringing)

16:45.254 --> 16:46.547
Please be Mom.

16:46.589 --> 16:48.048
Please be Mom. Please be Mom.

16:48.090 --> 16:50.927
Hello?

16:48.090 --> 16:50.927
Hello!

16:50.969 --> 16:52.887
Oh. Hi, Mr. Jackson.

16:52.929 --> 16:54.221
Well, yes,

16:54.263 --> 16:55.556
I do have a very good reason

16:55.598 --> 16:57.057
for not going in to work today.

16:57.099 --> 16:59.059
Well, how about this?

16:59.101 --> 17:00.979
I didn't come to work because

17:01.020 --> 17:05.692
somehow I felt that eight hours

17:01.020 --> 17:05.692
of joyless, mind-numbing crap

17:05.733 --> 17:07.568
just didn't seem like fun.

17:07.610 --> 17:11.197
Well, I guess we're just going

17:07.610 --> 17:11.197
to have to agree to disagree.

17:15.201 --> 17:16.160
(chuckles)

17:16.202 --> 17:17.662
REESE: Yeah!

17:16.202 --> 17:17.662
(whoops)

17:17.704 --> 17:19.914
(groans)

17:27.630 --> 17:29.799
I thought your flight

17:27.630 --> 17:29.799
wasn't till 11:00.

17:29.841 --> 17:31.676
It isn't.

17:31.718 --> 17:33.887
So we have some

17:31.718 --> 17:33.887
extra time.

17:33.928 --> 17:36.138
You want to...

17:33.928 --> 17:36.138
do something?

17:36.180 --> 17:38.349
We're in the middle

17:36.180 --> 17:38.349
of Alabama.

17:38.391 --> 17:40.351
What is there to do?

17:40.393 --> 17:42.102
Gay rodeo's in town.

17:42.144 --> 17:43.688
That could be

17:42.144 --> 17:43.688
interesting.

17:43.730 --> 17:46.106
Well, if that's

17:43.730 --> 17:46.106
what you want to do.

17:46.148 --> 17:47.817
Look, it isn't really

17:46.148 --> 17:47.817
what I want to do.

17:47.859 --> 17:49.109
I'm trying to

17:47.859 --> 17:49.109
be pleasant...

17:49.151 --> 17:51.070
We'll go.

17:52.071 --> 17:53.113
(knocking)

17:53.155 --> 17:54.114
Please be Mom.

17:54.156 --> 17:55.491
Craig.

17:55.533 --> 17:57.117
Just brought by

17:55.533 --> 17:57.117
your mom's paycheck.

17:57.159 --> 17:58.953
Tell her I'm the one

17:57.159 --> 17:58.953
that brought it by.

17:58.995 --> 18:00.830
Wait. We need your help.

18:00.872 --> 18:03.165
My dad's going crazy.

18:00.872 --> 18:03.165
He hasn't slept in four days.

18:03.207 --> 18:05.626
He's smoking, he's dancing

18:03.207 --> 18:05.626
around in his underwear.

18:05.668 --> 18:07.921
He's ripping phones

18:05.668 --> 18:07.921
out of the walls.

18:07.962 --> 18:10.172
You've got to stop him.

18:10.214 --> 18:11.716
Don't worry, son.

18:11.758 --> 18:13.259
I'll handle this.

18:15.845 --> 18:16.971
What are you doing?

18:17.013 --> 18:18.138
You don't expect me to tackle

18:18.180 --> 18:21.100
something like this

18:18.180 --> 18:21.100
on an empty stomach.

18:23.352 --> 18:25.145
Hey, buddy.

18:25.187 --> 18:27.231
Well, well.

18:27.273 --> 18:29.067
What do we have here?

18:29.108 --> 18:31.151
The boy here says you

18:29.108 --> 18:31.151
could use some company.

18:31.193 --> 18:34.072
No, I got my sons.

18:31.193 --> 18:34.072
We're bonding.

18:34.989 --> 18:35.990
(remote beeps)

18:36.032 --> 18:37.617
(gears whirring)

18:37.658 --> 18:39.827
What the hell

18:37.658 --> 18:39.827
is that thing?

18:39.869 --> 18:41.203
That thing is

18:39.869 --> 18:41.203
a little project

18:41.245 --> 18:42.997
we have been working on

18:41.245 --> 18:42.997
around here.

18:43.039 --> 18:46.250
A secret, deadly project.

18:46.292 --> 18:48.086
Hal...

18:48.127 --> 18:51.171
why don't you turn off

18:48.127 --> 18:51.171
the machine and sit down?

18:51.213 --> 18:55.175
Why don't you stop telling me

18:51.213 --> 18:55.175
what to do?

18:55.217 --> 18:59.806
Why don't you sit down

18:55.217 --> 18:59.806
like I asked you to?

19:02.224 --> 19:04.268
Look, Fats...

19:04.310 --> 19:06.854
I don't want you

19:04.310 --> 19:06.854
around my house anymore.

19:06.896 --> 19:09.189
Hey, you don't go

19:06.896 --> 19:09.189
to the fat thing,

19:09.231 --> 19:11.150
I won't go to the crazy thing.

19:12.652 --> 19:14.779
Dad, cut it out!

19:12.652 --> 19:14.779
Come on, it's not

19:12.652 --> 19:14.779
funny anymore!

19:14.821 --> 19:15.696
Leave him alone!

19:15.738 --> 19:17.490
Say "uncle"!

19:15.738 --> 19:17.490
No!

19:17.531 --> 19:18.699
Just say it.

19:18.741 --> 19:20.200
We can stop this right now

19:20.242 --> 19:22.369
with a little dignity

19:20.242 --> 19:22.369
if you just say it!

19:22.411 --> 19:23.579
I won't say it!

19:23.621 --> 19:25.790
One simple word.

19:25.832 --> 19:27.207
Duncle.

19:28.250 --> 19:29.669
Uh-uh, you said "duncle."

19:29.710 --> 19:32.212
Now you have to say "uncle"

19:29.710 --> 19:32.212
in my butt.

19:32.254 --> 19:33.464
No! Let me up!

19:33.506 --> 19:35.091
Dad, you have to stop it!

19:33.506 --> 19:35.091
Dad, no!

19:35.133 --> 19:36.467
You're right.

19:37.677 --> 19:39.303
I've got better

19:37.677 --> 19:39.303
things to do.

19:39.345 --> 19:40.930
MALCOLM:

19:39.345 --> 19:40.930
Dad, what are you doing?

19:40.972 --> 19:42.807
I think me

19:40.972 --> 19:42.807
and Lois Number Two here

19:42.849 --> 19:44.433
are going to go down to work

19:44.475 --> 19:47.227
and pay a little visit

19:44.475 --> 19:47.227
to Mr. Jackson's Lexus.

19:47.269 --> 19:49.063
Hey!

19:49.105 --> 19:50.272
Dad, don't move.

19:50.314 --> 19:52.232
(whirring)

19:50.314 --> 19:52.232
W-What are you doing?

19:52.274 --> 19:54.276
I'm stopping you

19:52.274 --> 19:54.276
from quitting your job

19:54.318 --> 19:56.278
by threatening you

19:54.318 --> 19:56.278
with a killer robot.

19:56.320 --> 19:59.239
I wish this felt half

19:56.320 --> 19:59.239
as cool as it sounds.

19:59.281 --> 20:01.450
Just turn it off, Malcolm.

20:01.492 --> 20:02.869
Stop being crazy.

20:02.910 --> 20:05.454
Just put the remote down.

20:06.914 --> 20:10.417
You-you have no idea

20:06.914 --> 20:10.417
what this machine is capable of.

20:10.459 --> 20:11.961
Why don't you just sit down?

20:12.003 --> 20:14.714
And why don't you just

20:12.003 --> 20:14.714
put the remote down?

20:14.755 --> 20:16.256
Dad, please.

20:16.298 --> 20:18.134
Malcolm...

20:22.096 --> 20:24.223
Why don't you both

20:22.096 --> 20:24.223
just shut up?!

20:26.184 --> 20:27.226
(remote beeps)

20:33.733 --> 20:36.194
Run. No kidding. Run.

20:40.740 --> 20:42.282
Oh, no.

20:42.324 --> 20:44.202
(Hal whimpering)

20:44.243 --> 20:46.204
(bees buzzing)

20:57.423 --> 20:59.383
(whimpering)

21:02.178 --> 21:06.599
(muffled):

21:02.178 --> 21:06.599
Call... animal... control.

21:06.640 --> 21:08.893
You ripped the phone

21:06.640 --> 21:08.893
out of the wall.

21:08.935 --> 21:14.481
Go... to... the neighbor.

21:14.523 --> 21:16.483
They won't let us over anymore.

21:16.525 --> 21:20.780
Do... something.

21:20.821 --> 21:22.322
Why don't we just

21:20.821 --> 21:22.322
all sit down

21:22.364 --> 21:25.576
and no one will do anything

21:22.364 --> 21:25.576
until Mom gets home?

21:26.368 --> 21:28.246
Okay.

21:35.586 --> 21:37.713
(crowd cheering)

21:37.755 --> 21:40.340
I got to say,

21:37.755 --> 21:40.340
as far as gay rodeos go,

21:40.382 --> 21:41.842
this one's pretty entertaining.

21:41.884 --> 21:43.427
Are you sure you're

21:41.884 --> 21:43.427
not embarrassed

21:43.469 --> 21:45.345
to be seen with

21:43.469 --> 21:45.345
your mother?

21:45.387 --> 21:46.931
Nah.

21:46.973 --> 21:55.022
(crowd cheering)
