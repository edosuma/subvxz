10:26.359 --> 10:28.395
* OH, HAPPY DAY *

10:28.461 --> 10:29.529
STEVE.

10:29.596 --> 10:31.899
* OH, HAPPY DAY *

10:31.965 --> 10:33.366
STEVE.

10:33.433 --> 10:35.302
* OH, HAPPY DAY *

10:35.368 --> 10:37.270
STEVE!

10:37.337 --> 10:39.439
MMM.

10:39.506 --> 10:42.609
IT'S NOT
A HAPPY DAY, STEVE.

10:42.676 --> 10:44.011
HONEY,
YOU'RE WAY OFF-KEY.

10:44.077 --> 10:46.413
LET'S SEE
IF A PITCH PIPE
WILL HELP.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.148
TRY THIS.

10:48.215 --> 10:50.250
O.K. HERE WE GO.

10:50.317 --> 10:52.452
* MMM *

10:52.519 --> 10:54.121
STEVE, YOU'RE
NOT LISTENING.

10:54.187 --> 10:56.223
LISTEN TO IT NOW.

10:56.289 --> 10:58.191
* MMM *

10:58.258 --> 11:00.961
STEVE, LISTEN TO IT.

11:01.795 --> 11:03.363
* MMM, MMM *

11:03.430 --> 11:05.098
* MMM, MMM *

11:09.469 --> 11:11.438
WE HAVE
A MAJOR PROBLEM.

11:11.504 --> 11:12.505
MAYBE YOU COULD
COME BACK

11:12.572 --> 11:14.541
WHEN YOUR VOICE
HAS CHANGED.

11:14.607 --> 11:16.810
IT ALREADY DID.

11:19.579 --> 11:21.014
WELL, STEVE,
I'M SORRY,

11:21.081 --> 11:23.216
BUT GOSPEL SUNDAY
IS VERY IMPORTANT,

11:23.283 --> 11:25.719
AND I CAN'T LET YOU
IN THE CHOIR.

11:25.786 --> 11:27.520
AW. AW.
AW.

11:27.587 --> 11:29.556
RACHEL, RACHEL,
RACHEL, RACHEL.

11:29.622 --> 11:30.824
HE JUST JOINED.

11:30.891 --> 11:31.925
GIVE HIM A CHANCE.

11:31.992 --> 11:33.160
YEAH.
YEAH.
YEAH.

11:33.226 --> 11:34.962
EXCUSE ME,

11:35.028 --> 11:37.430
BUT WILL EVERYONE
WHO IS DIRECTING
THIS CHOIR

11:37.497 --> 11:38.799
PLEASE RAISE
THEIR BATON?

11:43.837 --> 11:44.805
WELL,
THAT'S SETTLED.

11:44.872 --> 11:46.774
NOW, STEVE...

11:46.840 --> 11:48.108
YOUR HYMNAL, PLEASE.

11:49.276 --> 11:51.011
SHE CAN'T DO THAT.

11:51.078 --> 11:52.279
O.K.

12:16.136 --> 12:21.441
* GO TELL IT
ON THE MOUNTAIN *

12:21.508 --> 12:23.643
HALLELUJAH.

12:23.710 --> 12:26.513
* OVER THE HILLS *

12:26.579 --> 12:31.785
* AND EVERYWHERE *

12:31.852 --> 12:33.253
* GO *

12:33.320 --> 12:37.457
* TELL IT
ON THE MOUNTAIN *

12:37.524 --> 12:38.491
HALLELUJAH.

12:38.558 --> 12:43.496
* THAT JESUS CHRIST *

12:43.563 --> 12:45.432
* IS BORN *

12:46.333 --> 12:47.334
NO.

12:47.400 --> 12:48.135
* GO-- *

12:48.201 --> 12:50.303
PEOPLE, PEOPLE,
PEOPLE.

12:50.370 --> 12:53.473
NOW, I KNOW
WE'VE BEEN
REHEARSING THIS SONG

12:53.540 --> 12:55.909
FOR SIX HOURS,

12:55.976 --> 12:58.111
BUT IT'S LOSING
ITS FRESHNESS.

12:58.178 --> 13:01.148
YEAH, PEOPLE.
LET'S PERK IT UP.

13:02.649 --> 13:03.616
MARGE.

13:03.683 --> 13:05.085
YES?

13:05.152 --> 13:06.486
SISTER.

13:06.553 --> 13:08.588
SING FROM
YOUR DIAPHRAGM,

13:08.655 --> 13:09.689
NOT YOUR SINUSES.

13:09.756 --> 13:10.824
OOH.
OOH.

13:10.891 --> 13:12.225
AND,
BROTHER SPENCER,

13:12.292 --> 13:14.327
SLAP SOME POLYGRIP
ON THOSE CHOPPERS.

13:15.295 --> 13:17.497
YOU SOUND LIKE
A PAIR OF CASTANETS.

13:17.564 --> 13:19.699
RACHEL!
ZIP IT, HARRIETTE!

13:19.766 --> 13:21.234
I GOT WORK TO DO HERE.

13:22.269 --> 13:24.504
O.K. NOW,
ONCE MORE.

13:24.571 --> 13:26.673
AND THIS TIME,

13:26.739 --> 13:28.508
SEE IF YOU CAN
FOLLOW MY BATON.

13:33.813 --> 13:36.016
* GO TELL IT
ON THE MOUNTAIN *

13:36.083 --> 13:38.351
* OVER THE HILLS
AND EVERYWHERE *

13:38.418 --> 13:40.921
* GO TELL IT
ON THE MOUNTAIN *

13:40.988 --> 13:45.225
* THAT JESUS CHRIST
IS BORN *

13:45.292 --> 13:47.560
* GO TELL IT
ON THE MOUNTAIN-- *

13:47.627 --> 13:48.561
HOLD IT.

13:48.628 --> 13:49.562
* HALLELUJAH *

13:49.629 --> 13:52.065
CARL.

13:52.866 --> 13:55.368
86 THE HALLELUJAHS.

13:55.435 --> 13:56.403
WHAT ABOUT MY SOLO?

13:56.469 --> 13:58.405
86 THAT, TOO.

13:58.471 --> 14:00.107
WHAT--

14:01.208 --> 14:03.343
RACHEL,
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

14:03.410 --> 14:04.844
I BOUGHT YOU A HAT.

14:04.912 --> 14:07.047
I CAN DO
WHATEVER I WANT

14:07.114 --> 14:10.617
BECAUSE I'M
THE CHOIR DIRECTOR.

14:10.683 --> 14:12.319
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY.

14:12.385 --> 14:13.420
PROBLEM?

14:13.486 --> 14:14.888
NOW, NOW, NOW, RACHEL.

14:14.955 --> 14:17.357
IF CARL'S NOT SINGING
THE SOLO, WHO IS?

14:17.424 --> 14:20.593
WELL...

14:20.660 --> 14:21.628
I AM.

14:21.694 --> 14:23.897
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY.

14:23.964 --> 14:27.200
LOOK.
MARGE AND I HAVE
THE BEST VOICES,

14:27.267 --> 14:29.937
SO I FLIPPED A COIN,
AND I WON.

14:30.003 --> 14:31.471
OHH.
OHH.
OHH.

14:31.538 --> 14:33.506
HEY. NOW, LOOK.

14:33.573 --> 14:34.807
I AM IN CHARGE HERE.

14:34.874 --> 14:37.477
THAT IS WHY
I HAVE THE BATON.

14:40.680 --> 14:41.648
THERE.

14:41.714 --> 14:43.083
[GASP]

14:43.150 --> 14:45.885
NOW YOU HAVE TWO.

14:48.956 --> 14:52.059
WHERE ARE YOU GOING
WITH MY HAT?

14:52.125 --> 14:54.527
COME BACK HERE.

14:54.594 --> 14:56.263
RIGHT NOW. PEOP--

14:57.697 --> 15:01.334
THAT'S IT!
YOU WILL NEVER SING
IN THIS TOWN AGAIN!

15:04.404 --> 15:06.206
OH!

15:18.918 --> 15:20.553
OOH.

15:29.529 --> 15:33.000
YOU WON AGAIN.

15:33.066 --> 15:34.367
HOW DID YOU GET
SO GOOD AT CHECKERS?

15:34.434 --> 15:35.568
PRACTICE.

15:35.635 --> 15:38.105
FORTUNATELY,
WHEN I WAS YOUNG,
I HAD NO FRIENDS.

15:41.008 --> 15:43.043
STEVE, DID YOU
TELL YOUR PARENTS

15:43.110 --> 15:44.344
THAT YOU WENT
TO CHURCH?

15:44.411 --> 15:45.545
OH, YEAH.

15:45.612 --> 15:47.047
HOW DID THEY TAKE IT?

15:47.114 --> 15:49.116
OH, NOT TOO GOOD.

15:49.182 --> 15:50.217
MY FATHER SAID,

15:50.283 --> 15:52.052
"STEVEN, STOP THIS
CHURCH NONSENSE

15:52.119 --> 15:53.386
"AND REJOIN
YOUR MOTHER AND ME

15:53.453 --> 15:55.355
IN THE SENSORY
DEPRIVATION TANKS."

15:57.090 --> 15:58.425
AND I SAID,

15:58.491 --> 15:59.859
"TANKS?

15:59.926 --> 16:01.461
NO TANKS."

16:04.031 --> 16:06.833
WELL, IT'S PROBABLY
BECAUSE THEY MISS YOU.

16:06.899 --> 16:09.036
NO. PHILOSOPHICAL
DISAGREEMENT.

16:09.102 --> 16:11.338
MY FATHER
DEMANDED TO KNOW

16:11.404 --> 16:12.805
HOW, WITH MY
SCIENTIFIC TRAINING,

16:12.872 --> 16:15.075
I COULD BELIEVE
IN GOD.

16:15.142 --> 16:17.444
I CAN'T TOUCH,
SEE, OR FEEL HIM.

16:17.510 --> 16:19.079
BUT I POINTED OUT

16:19.146 --> 16:22.849
THAT I CAN'T
TOUCH, SEE,
OR FEEL AN ATOM,

16:22.915 --> 16:24.484
BUT I BELIEVE
IT EXISTS.

16:24.551 --> 16:27.120
YOU'RE RIGHT.
WE CALL THAT FAITH.

16:30.557 --> 16:31.491
HI.

16:31.558 --> 16:32.959
OH, HI, SUGAR.

16:33.026 --> 16:34.661
WHERE IS EVERYBODY?

16:34.727 --> 16:36.529
THEY WENT OUT
TO DINNER.

16:36.596 --> 16:37.930
WHY DIDN'T YOU GO?

16:37.997 --> 16:40.600
HARRIETTE, CARL,
AND I DREW STRAWS

16:40.667 --> 16:41.701
TO SEE
WHO WOULD STAY

16:41.768 --> 16:44.104
TO HAVE A
HEART-TO-HEART TALK
WITH YOU.

16:45.472 --> 16:46.839
AND YOU WON.

16:46.906 --> 16:49.176
WON. LOST. WHAT'S
THE DIFFERENCE?

16:50.477 --> 16:51.311
RACHEL.

16:51.378 --> 16:53.280
SIT OVER HERE,
SWEETHEART.

16:56.949 --> 16:58.818
RACHEL.

16:58.885 --> 17:02.489
YOU KNOW HOW
YOU'VE BEEN ACTING
AS CHOIR DIRECTOR?

17:04.424 --> 17:05.892
YES.

17:05.958 --> 17:07.427
WELL, UH...

17:07.494 --> 17:09.829
KNOCK IT OFF.

17:09.896 --> 17:11.564
EXCUSE ME?

17:11.631 --> 17:14.401
RACHEL, THE GOOD LORD
DOESN'T CARE

17:14.467 --> 17:17.704
IF HIS PRAISES
ARE SUNG OFF-KEY

17:17.770 --> 17:21.174
AS LONG AS IT'S SUNG
STRAIGHT FROM THE HEART.

17:25.612 --> 17:27.480
YOU'RE RIGHT.

17:27.547 --> 17:30.283
STEVE, I SHOULDN'T
HAVE KICKED YOU
OUT OF THE CHOIR.

17:30.350 --> 17:32.752
LOOK ON
THE BRIGHT SIDE.

17:32.819 --> 17:34.921
YOU JUST SAVED ME
THE TROUBLE OF
QUITTING LATER ON

17:34.987 --> 17:39.926
WITH ALL THE OTHERS.

17:39.992 --> 17:41.928
I GUESS
I HAD THAT COMING.

17:41.994 --> 17:44.297
I REALLY MESSED UP.

17:44.364 --> 17:45.732
GOSPEL SUNDAY
IS IN TWO DAYS,

17:45.798 --> 17:47.934
AND THE CHOIR
WON'T EVEN TALK TO ME.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.236
WELL, APOLOGIZE
TO THEM.

17:49.302 --> 17:51.037
MAYBE THEY'LL
FORGIVE YOU.

17:51.104 --> 17:54.274
NOT AFTER
THE WAY I ACTED.

17:54.341 --> 17:57.344
RACHEL, JUST BEFORE
YOU CAME IN,

17:57.410 --> 18:00.213
STEVE AND I WERE
DISCUSSING FAITH.

18:02.549 --> 18:04.517
IT SEEMS TO ME

18:04.584 --> 18:07.487
YOU SHOULD APOLOGIZE
TO THE CHOIR...

18:07.554 --> 18:13.025
AND HAVE FAITH
THEY WILL FORGIVE YOU.

18:13.092 --> 18:14.527
BUT WHAT IF THEY
DON'T FORGIVE ME?

18:14.594 --> 18:16.629
THEN YOU'LL HAVE
TO LEAVE TOWN.

18:25.305 --> 18:32.245
AND AS GOD TELLS US
IN PSALM 95, VERSE 1,

18:32.312 --> 18:35.382
"LET US SING
UNTO THE LORD.

18:37.584 --> 18:40.420
"LET US MAKE
A JOYFUL NOISE

18:40.487 --> 18:43.122
TO THE ROCK
OF OUR SALVATION."

18:46.025 --> 18:48.195
BUT WE'RE NOT GOING
TO DO THAT TODAY.

18:48.261 --> 18:49.529
AW. AW.
AW.

18:49.596 --> 18:51.631
GOSPEL SUNDAY
HAS BEEN CANCELED.

18:51.698 --> 18:53.166
OH, NO.

18:53.233 --> 18:56.102
PLANS GOT CHANGED.

18:56.169 --> 18:58.905
THINGS GOT SWITCHED.

18:58.971 --> 19:02.108
PEOPLE HAD OBLIGATIONS.

19:02.175 --> 19:03.109
PASTOR PEEBLE.

19:03.176 --> 19:05.745
YES, RACHEL?

19:05.812 --> 19:09.416
THE CONGREGATION
DESERVES TO HEAR
THE TRUTH.

19:09.482 --> 19:10.750
PLEASE.

19:16.989 --> 19:18.425
FOLKS...

19:18.491 --> 19:21.928
THE REASON GOSPEL SUNDAY
WAS CANCELED

19:21.994 --> 19:24.096
IS BECAUSE
THE CHOIR QUIT.

19:24.163 --> 19:25.565
OH, NO.

19:25.632 --> 19:27.700
AND THE REASON
THE CHOIR QUIT

19:27.767 --> 19:32.205
WAS BECAUSE THE MOMENT
I BECAME CHOIR DIRECTOR,

19:32.272 --> 19:33.640
I STARTED ACTING
LIKE A JERK.

19:33.706 --> 19:35.842
AMEN. WELL.
AMEN.

19:37.577 --> 19:39.512
I GOT
A SWELLED HEAD.

19:39.579 --> 19:41.514
I STARTED
PICKING ON PEOPLE

19:41.581 --> 19:43.883
AND JUST BOSSING
EVERYONE AROUND.

19:45.218 --> 19:46.619
I AM TRULY SORRY,

19:46.686 --> 19:48.120
AND I JUST HOPE

19:48.187 --> 19:51.190
YOU CAN FIND IT
IN YOUR HEARTS

19:51.258 --> 19:52.191
TO FORGIVE ME.

19:52.259 --> 19:54.661
OHH.
OH, NO.

19:54.727 --> 19:56.996
RACHEL.

19:57.063 --> 19:58.831
YES?

19:58.898 --> 20:02.435
* PUT YOUR HAND
IN THE HAND
OF THE MAN *

20:02.502 --> 20:06.839
* WHO STILLED THE WATER *

20:06.906 --> 20:10.410
* PUT YOUR HAND
IN THE HAND
OF THE MAN *

20:10.477 --> 20:12.979
* THAT CALMED
THE SEA *

20:15.181 --> 20:17.750
* TAKE A LOOK
AT YOURSELF *

20:17.817 --> 20:22.922
* AND YOU MAY
LOOK AT OTHERS
DIFFERENTLY *

20:22.989 --> 20:26.759
* BY PUTTING YOUR HAND
IN THE HAND
OF THE MAN *

20:26.826 --> 20:29.796
* FROM GALILEE *

20:31.464 --> 20:35.402
* PUT YOUR HAND
IN THE HAND OF THE MAN *

20:35.468 --> 20:39.772
* WHO STILLED THE WATER *

20:39.839 --> 20:44.477
* PUT YOUR HAND
IN THE HAND OF THE MAN *

20:44.544 --> 20:47.347
* WHO CALMED THE SEA *

20:47.414 --> 20:49.215
* TAKE A GOOD LOOK *

20:49.282 --> 20:51.050
* AT YOURSELF *

20:51.117 --> 20:55.455
* YOU MIGHT LOOK
AT OTHERS DIFFERENTLY *

20:55.522 --> 20:57.357
* BY PUTTING
YOUR HANDS *

20:57.424 --> 20:59.326
* IN THE HANDS
OF THE MAN *

20:59.392 --> 21:02.228
* FROM GALILEE *

21:02.295 --> 21:03.863
OH, YEAH.

21:03.930 --> 21:07.534
* PUT YOUR HAND
IN THE HAND OF THE MAN *

21:07.600 --> 21:09.235
* WHO STILLED THE WATER *

21:09.302 --> 21:10.236
AMEN!

21:10.303 --> 21:11.738
* THE WATER *

21:11.804 --> 21:15.408
* PUT YOUR HAND
IN THE HAND OF THE MAN *

21:15.475 --> 21:18.578
* WHO CALMED THE SEA *

21:18.645 --> 21:21.948
* TAKE A LOOK
AT YOURSELF *

21:22.014 --> 21:26.986
* AND YOU MIGHT LOOK
AT OTHERS DIFFERENTLY *

21:27.053 --> 21:31.190
* BY PUTTING YOUR HAND
IN THE HAND OF THE MAN *

21:31.257 --> 21:32.425
* FROM GALILEE *

21:32.492 --> 21:34.827
* OHH, OHH *

21:34.894 --> 21:38.565
* PUT YOUR HAND
IN THE HAND OF THE MAN *

21:38.631 --> 21:42.001
* WHO STILLED THE WATER *

21:42.068 --> 21:46.305
* PUT YOUR HAND
IN THE HAND OF THE MAN *

21:46.373 --> 21:48.240
* WHO CALMED THE SEA *

21:48.307 --> 21:50.176
* CALMED THE SEA *

21:50.242 --> 21:52.111
* TAKE A LOOK
AT YOURSELF *

21:52.178 --> 21:58.418
* AND YOU MIGHT LOOK
AT OTHERS DIFFERENTLY *

21:59.419 --> 22:05.358
* OH OH OH *
