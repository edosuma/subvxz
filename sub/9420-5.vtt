00:42.309 --> 00:44.043

>> action.

This show has ever seen.

01:07.902 --> 01:08.567
>> forgiveness...

01:08.569 --> 01:10.202

01:10.204 --> 01:11.236
If you are honest

01:11.238 --> 01:12.137
From the get-go.

01:12.139 --> 01:14.039
>> and shocking twists are back.

Hi, and welcome back to the nev

01:26.654 --> 01:30.155
Alone in hotel rooms show.

01:30.157 --> 01:31.657
Nobody's here.

01:31.659 --> 01:35.060
It's just big, empty, cold bed.

01:35.062 --> 01:36.095
No max.

01:36.097 --> 01:37.162
But in the meantime,

01:37.164 --> 01:38.197
The show must go on.

01:38.199 --> 01:39.631
This next co-host is someone

01:39.633 --> 01:41.200
Who is, in fact,

01:41.202 --> 01:42.601
Partially responsible

For max not being here.

01:58.719 --> 02:00.219
>> in your observation of max,

02:00.221 --> 02:01.320
Do you think you could kind of

02:01.322 --> 02:02.121
Bring a little bit

02:02.123 --> 02:03.755
Of that character to the show?

02:03.757 --> 02:04.523

Yeah, you got it.

02:14.034 --> 02:15.467

02:28.282 --> 02:28.981
>> all right,

02:28.983 --> 02:31.049
Hello, my name is chitara.

02:31.051 --> 02:32.684
I'm 28 years old.

02:32.686 --> 02:33.619
Born and raised

02:33.621 --> 02:35.420
In durham, north carolina

02:35.422 --> 02:37.756
And a mother of two children.

02:37.758 --> 02:39.191
I am reaching out to you guys

02:39.193 --> 02:41.326
Because i met a young lady

02:41.328 --> 02:43.128
By the name of priscilla

02:43.130 --> 02:45.030
Online six months ago.

02:45.032 --> 02:47.099
Priscilla is 22

02:47.101 --> 02:49.067
And is a professional nurse.

02:49.069 --> 02:50.269
We met on a site called

02:50.271 --> 02:52.037
Mocospace.

02:52.039 --> 02:53.705
From there, things took off.

02:53.707 --> 02:56.575
We talked every day, all day.

02:56.577 --> 02:58.577
I fell in love with her.

03:02.482 --> 03:07.085
But, there were some concerns.

03:07.087 --> 03:08.153
She told me that she

03:08.155 --> 03:09.688
Lived in durham as well.

03:09.690 --> 03:11.723
Whenever we made plans to meet

03:11.725 --> 03:15.294
Something always came up.

03:15.296 --> 03:16.495
Even video chatting

03:16.497 --> 03:18.263
With her was like pulling teeth.

03:18.265 --> 03:20.966
Needless to say, we never met

03:20.968 --> 03:22.334
Or video chatted.

03:22.336 --> 03:24.036
Last month, she told me

03:24.038 --> 03:25.437
That she no longer loved me

03:25.439 --> 03:26.972
And that everything she said

03:26.974 --> 03:29.675
And felt was nothing but lies.

03:34.714 --> 03:37.216
>> oh, ow, that poor girl.

03:37.218 --> 03:38.650
It's so mean.

03:38.652 --> 03:39.318
>> i'm left with

03:39.320 --> 03:40.385
So many questions.

03:40.387 --> 03:42.721
Mainly, why?

03:47.126 --> 03:48.393
I still want to meet her

03:48.395 --> 03:49.127
And get the answers

03:49.129 --> 03:50.495
To the questions that i have.

03:50.497 --> 03:53.232
Can you guys please help?

03:53.234 --> 03:55.067
>> i have been dumped

03:55.069 --> 03:56.535
In such a way.

03:56.537 --> 03:57.536
I was very close

03:57.538 --> 03:59.171
To a girl in the past

03:59.173 --> 04:00.105
And she really just

04:00.107 --> 04:02.674
Ended all ties with me and yeah,

04:02.676 --> 04:04.343
I can relate to our lady,

04:04.345 --> 04:05.210
Chitara here.

04:05.212 --> 04:06.345
That's terrible.

04:06.347 --> 04:08.513
>> to not even really understand

04:08.515 --> 04:10.015
Who that person is

04:10.017 --> 04:11.116
And why they broke up with you

04:11.118 --> 04:13.252
Is like an extra sort

04:13.254 --> 04:14.586
Of awful element.

04:14.588 --> 04:15.988
What do you think?

04:15.990 --> 04:17.356
Alex, can you help chitara?

04:17.358 --> 04:18.523
>> i think we can help.

04:18.524 --> 04:19.190
>> all right.

04:19.192 --> 04:20.659
So, i'm gonna try and add her

04:20.661 --> 04:22.094
To this call a second.

04:22.096 --> 04:22.861
>> oh, okay.

04:22.863 --> 04:24.429
[phone dials]

04:24.431 --> 04:26.131
>> hey.

04:26.133 --> 04:27.499
>> hi!

04:27.501 --> 04:28.166
>> hello.

04:28.168 --> 04:28.834
>> hi, alex.

04:28.836 --> 04:29.501
>> you have two kids,

04:29.503 --> 04:30.168
Which is amazing.

04:30.170 --> 04:31.737
Were you married,

04:31.739 --> 04:33.071
Or you had a boyfriend?

04:33.073 --> 04:35.107
>> i was engaged to their father

04:35.109 --> 04:36.108
At some point in time.

04:36.110 --> 04:38.110
But of course i'm not now.

04:38.112 --> 04:38.777
>> would you call

04:38.779 --> 04:39.578
Yourself bisexual?

04:39.580 --> 04:41.113
>> yes, i've been interested

04:41.115 --> 04:41.980
In females

04:41.982 --> 04:43.215
For as long as i can remember.

04:43.217 --> 04:45.017
I met priscilla on mocospace

04:45.019 --> 04:46.251
And i just--i thought she was

04:46.253 --> 04:48.120
Very, very attractive.

04:48.122 --> 04:49.288
What she said on her profile

04:49.290 --> 04:50.088
Interested me

04:50.090 --> 04:50.822
Because i could relate.

04:50.824 --> 04:51.556
She was just saying

04:51.558 --> 04:54.026
How she has been heartbroken.

04:54.028 --> 04:55.460
We would stay up all night

04:55.462 --> 04:57.629
Just laughing and joking.

04:57.631 --> 04:58.697
>> this is on the phone?

04:58.699 --> 04:59.364
>> yeah.

04:59.366 --> 05:00.032
It got to a point

05:00.034 --> 05:01.433
Where we could not go to sleep

05:01.435 --> 05:02.501
If we weren't on the phone

05:02.503 --> 05:03.702
Together.

05:03.704 --> 05:04.970
>> that's really sweet.

05:04.972 --> 05:05.637
That's, ah.

05:05.639 --> 05:06.305
>> yeah, well,

05:06.307 --> 05:07.072
It's kinda cute now

05:07.074 --> 05:08.073
That you think about it, huh?

05:08.075 --> 05:09.975
>> yeah, so, how could you over

05:09.977 --> 05:11.677
The course of those six months

05:11.679 --> 05:14.012
Not meet up with her?

05:14.014 --> 05:15.080
>> honey, your guess is as good

05:15.082 --> 05:15.881
As mine.

05:15.883 --> 05:17.082
I never understood.

05:17.084 --> 05:18.083
It was like every time,

05:18.085 --> 05:19.184
Something came up.

05:19.186 --> 05:20.552
>> you've watched the show.

05:20.554 --> 05:22.487
>> yes, and i really started to

05:22.489 --> 05:24.189
Feel like i was being catfished.

05:24.191 --> 05:24.890
And i brought it up

05:24.892 --> 05:25.757
In a conversation.

05:25.759 --> 05:26.525
I was like,

05:26.527 --> 05:27.526
Am i being catfished?

05:27.528 --> 05:29.127
And she was like, no,

05:29.129 --> 05:30.162
I had a feeling

05:30.164 --> 05:30.962
You were thinking that.

05:30.964 --> 05:32.097
But that's not it.

05:32.099 --> 05:33.732
It's just things keep coming up.

05:33.734 --> 05:35.100
It was just really

05:35.102 --> 05:36.668
Suspect the entire time.

05:36.670 --> 05:40.339
But i guess i was blinded.

05:40.341 --> 05:41.306
And then she told me

05:41.308 --> 05:45.277
That her mom passed.

05:45.279 --> 05:46.311
That's when i could kind of

05:46.313 --> 05:48.046
Sense that things were changing.

05:48.048 --> 05:49.448
She kind of withdrew from me.

05:49.450 --> 05:50.115
And so,

05:50.117 --> 05:51.450
I was like you seem distant.

05:51.452 --> 05:54.286
She sent me this long message

05:54.288 --> 05:54.986
And was like,

05:54.988 --> 05:56.288
I am interested

05:56.290 --> 05:57.322
In somebody else.

05:57.324 --> 06:00.926
And it was a him.

06:00.928 --> 06:02.227
>> it was a guy?

06:02.229 --> 06:05.230
>> she told me everything that i

06:05.232 --> 06:08.533
Told you i felt was a lie.

06:08.535 --> 06:09.668
Everything.

06:09.670 --> 06:11.370
I'm like, really?

06:11.372 --> 06:12.537
>> you guys were, like, falling

06:12.539 --> 06:14.406
Asleep on the phone together.

06:14.408 --> 06:16.174
That's not--you don't fake

06:16.176 --> 06:17.275
That unless, like, you're,

06:17.277 --> 06:19.511
Like, really, like, crazy.

06:19.513 --> 06:20.579
>> this was only about a month

06:20.581 --> 06:21.380
Ago that you guys broke up.

06:21.382 --> 06:22.080
Do you think

06:22.082 --> 06:23.515
That you still love her?

06:23.517 --> 06:24.616
>> i'm conflicted.

06:24.618 --> 06:25.684
I loved her.

06:25.686 --> 06:26.418
I did.

06:26.420 --> 06:28.954
It was real for me.

06:28.956 --> 06:29.955
>> this is an interesting

06:29.957 --> 06:31.256
And new kind of story for us

06:31.258 --> 06:33.492

06:33.494 --> 06:34.593
I want to help you.

06:34.595 --> 06:35.527

06:39.299 --> 06:40.065

06:41.368 --> 06:43.135
>> see you, guys.

06:43.137 --> 06:43.969
Okay, well,

06:43.971 --> 06:45.070
I've got my marching orders.

06:45.072 --> 06:46.171
I know what i need to do.

06:46.173 --> 06:48.006
Let's start another crazy,

06:48.008 --> 06:49.975
Epic adventure

06:49.977 --> 06:53.111

>> how you doing?

07:04.591 --> 07:05.357
>> i'm doing good.

07:05.359 --> 07:06.925
So, you're the new max?

07:06.927 --> 07:07.626
>> i am the new max.

07:07.628 --> 07:08.560
>> you feel like you're going to

07:08.562 --> 07:09.661
Do a good job filling his shoes?

07:09.663 --> 07:10.629
>> i'm gonna do my best.

07:10.631 --> 07:12.297
>> all right, i like your style.

07:12.299 --> 07:13.165
Well then, let's do it.

07:13.167 --> 07:14.566
>> let's do it.

07:14.568 --> 07:16.368
>> catfish!

07:16.370 --> 07:18.470
>> [laughs]

07:23.042 --> 07:23.708
>> both: Hey.

07:23.710 --> 07:25.277
>> hi!

07:25.279 --> 07:26.711
>> hi, this is alex.

07:26.713 --> 07:27.379
>> hi, alex.

07:27.381 --> 07:28.046
>> good to see you.

07:28.048 --> 07:28.713
>> oh, look at that.

07:28.715 --> 07:29.481
Right in there for the hug.

07:29.483 --> 07:30.048
>> i just...

07:30.050 --> 07:30.715
>> come in.

07:30.717 --> 07:31.383
>> run in.

07:31.385 --> 07:32.083
>> we got the whole crew

07:32.085 --> 07:32.717
Here, too.

07:32.719 --> 07:34.085
>> hi, crew.

07:34.087 --> 07:35.020
>> how's the bull city

07:35.022 --> 07:35.720
Treating you?

07:35.722 --> 07:36.488
>> bull city?

07:36.490 --> 07:38.190
>> bull city, i like that.

07:38.192 --> 07:38.990
You got to put the fingers

07:38.992 --> 07:40.258
Out, yeah.

07:40.260 --> 07:41.426
>> what was so special about

07:41.428 --> 07:42.427
Priscilla that made you, like--

07:42.429 --> 07:43.428
>> she just

07:43.430 --> 07:44.896
Was a little more mature

07:44.898 --> 07:46.431
Than most 22 year olds.

07:46.433 --> 07:47.666
And she just seemed like she was

07:47.668 --> 07:49.634
A genuine, caring person.

07:49.636 --> 07:51.136
Sometimes being a mom,

07:51.138 --> 07:52.437
It can get stressful.

07:52.439 --> 07:54.039
And so, i would call her,

07:54.041 --> 07:55.407
Or i would let her know, like,

07:55.409 --> 07:56.208
How i was feeling

07:56.210 --> 07:57.476
And she would always offer

07:57.478 --> 07:58.710
Some words of encouragement.

07:58.712 --> 07:59.544
When i needed her,

07:59.546 --> 08:00.212
She was there.

08:00.214 --> 08:01.079
And that's what mattered

08:01.081 --> 08:02.247
The most to me.

08:02.249 --> 08:04.049
>> so, she said she lived in?

08:04.051 --> 08:04.883
>> said she lived in durham.

08:04.885 --> 08:05.617
>> lived in durham?

08:05.619 --> 08:06.384
>> but she would never tell

08:06.386 --> 08:07.085
Me where.

08:07.087 --> 08:07.786
>> have you ever, like,

08:07.788 --> 08:09.087
Called her out and asked her?

08:09.089 --> 08:10.021
>> i asked, i was like, do you

08:10.023 --> 08:10.989
Really live in durham, for real?

08:10.991 --> 08:11.690
Be real with me.

08:11.692 --> 08:12.390
Be honest.

08:12.392 --> 08:13.492
Yeah, i do, i do.

08:13.494 --> 08:15.327
I'm like, okay.

08:15.329 --> 08:16.428
>> before with the guy

08:16.430 --> 08:17.696
Who you had your children with,

08:17.698 --> 08:19.264
Had you had any girlfriends?

08:19.266 --> 08:20.665
>> yes, one serious girlfriend.

08:20.667 --> 08:22.033
>> and were you public about

08:22.035 --> 08:22.868
That with your...

08:22.870 --> 08:23.535
>> no.

08:23.537 --> 08:24.202
>> friends and family?

08:24.204 --> 08:24.870
>> no.

08:24.872 --> 08:25.704
>> no, okay, so, that was a sort

08:25.706 --> 08:26.671
Of secret girlfriend?

08:26.673 --> 08:32.043
>> yeah, until i met priscilla.

08:32.044 --> 08:33.678
And when i met her

08:33.679 --> 08:34.379
That's when i told,

08:34.381 --> 08:36.014
Like, my aunts and uncles

08:36.015 --> 08:36.681
And i was like,

08:36.683 --> 08:38.450
You know, i have a girlfriend.

08:38.452 --> 08:39.618
I showed pictures.

08:39.620 --> 08:40.284
Like, they was, like,

08:40.287 --> 08:42.020
Oh, she's pretty.

08:42.022 --> 08:42.754
>> and how did your family

08:42.756 --> 08:43.554
Take it when you told them

08:43.557 --> 08:45.123
That you were dating a girl?

08:45.125 --> 08:46.024
>> yeah, they were fine.

08:46.026 --> 08:48.960
I was ready to be serious.

08:48.962 --> 08:49.961
>> and then, just all

08:49.963 --> 08:51.997
Of a sudden out of nowhere?

08:51.999 --> 08:52.664
>> i'm interested

08:52.666 --> 08:54.466
In somebody else.

08:54.468 --> 09:00.272
And what the hell?

09:00.274 --> 09:01.907
>> let's just see this girl.

09:01.909 --> 09:03.041
Oh.

09:03.043 --> 09:03.842
>> she's very pretty.

09:03.844 --> 09:04.609
>> here she is.

09:04.611 --> 09:09.414
Kissy face.

09:09.416 --> 09:11.249
>> i have lots of pictures,

09:11.251 --> 09:13.218
Thousands of text messages.

09:13.220 --> 09:15.120
It was people who lived together

09:15.122 --> 09:16.288
Who probably didn't talk as much

09:16.290 --> 09:18.189
As we did.

09:22.261 --> 09:23.328
>> well, these are like...

09:23.330 --> 09:25.130
>> full-fledged conversations.

09:25.132 --> 09:27.432
>> like, real conversations.

09:27.434 --> 09:29.334
>> yeah.

09:37.476 --> 09:38.577
It had to me for me

09:38.579 --> 09:39.477
To have come out to,

09:39.479 --> 09:41.680
Like, my family and risk

09:41.682 --> 09:43.181
The possibility of everybody

09:43.183 --> 09:45.617
Being, like, the hell with you.

09:45.619 --> 09:47.619
And so it's like,

09:47.621 --> 09:49.020
What the hell happened?

09:49.022 --> 09:51.056
What went wrong?

09:51.058 --> 09:53.091
>> if we do end up

09:53.093 --> 09:56.094
Getting an explanation from her

09:56.096 --> 09:59.431
And it makes some sense,

09:59.433 --> 10:00.699
Don't you think

10:00.701 --> 10:05.503
Maybe this could still work out?

10:05.505 --> 10:08.073
>> i--i guess

10:08.075 --> 10:09.341
She would have to come up

10:09.343 --> 10:12.210
With a damn good explanation.

10:12.212 --> 10:14.212
She would have to work her ass

10:14.214 --> 10:16.114
Off to get my heart again.

10:16.116 --> 10:17.449
>> so, there is a slim chance?

10:17.451 --> 10:19.651
>> she ripped my heart apart.

10:19.653 --> 10:20.418
And, like, even now

10:20.420 --> 10:22.020
Sitting here, like,

10:22.022 --> 10:23.054
Reading over those messages,

10:23.056 --> 10:25.190
Like, it hurts.

10:25.192 --> 10:26.491
>> you still definitely find

10:26.493 --> 10:28.226
Her sexy and attractive?

10:28.228 --> 10:29.060
>> help me no more.

10:29.062 --> 10:30.128
She can still get the business.

10:30.130 --> 10:30.829
Got to get--

10:30.831 --> 10:31.663
>> wait a second,

10:31.665 --> 10:32.864
Wait, she'll still get down?

10:32.866 --> 10:33.598
>> she can still get

10:33.600 --> 10:34.532
The business.

10:34.534 --> 10:35.200
I'm--she bad.

10:35.202 --> 10:35.867
>> well, this just

10:35.869 --> 10:37.068
Got a lot more exciting.

10:37.070 --> 10:38.370
>> uh-huh.

10:38.372 --> 10:39.638
>> you look at some pictures,

10:39.640 --> 10:40.505
Just to get the business.

10:40.507 --> 10:41.339
>> all right.

10:41.341 --> 10:42.140
>> she can still

10:42.142 --> 10:43.141
Get the business.

10:43.143 --> 10:44.576
>> so, let's just get to it.

10:44.578 --> 10:49.047
>> thank you, bye.

10:49.049 --> 10:49.814
>> for me it's strange

10:49.816 --> 10:50.649
Someone can go from being

10:50.651 --> 10:52.350
An incredibly loving,

10:52.352 --> 10:53.318
Communicative person

10:53.320 --> 10:54.452
Who talks on the phone all night

10:54.454 --> 10:55.353
Long to all of a sudden

10:55.355 --> 10:58.957
Just a cold, distant woman.

10:58.959 --> 11:00.258
>> really could be the case

11:00.260 --> 11:03.161
That she is actually a lesbian

11:03.163 --> 11:04.396
And that the people

11:04.398 --> 11:05.463
In her real life...

11:05.465 --> 11:06.197
>> found out?

11:06.199 --> 11:06.931
>> yeah.

11:06.933 --> 11:09.401
>> it was like, end that now.

11:09.403 --> 11:10.435
So, it really could be anything

11:10.437 --> 11:12.404
At this point.

11:12.406 --> 11:13.505
Anything is possible.

11:17.309 --> 11:18.777
>> ready to crack this case?

11:18.779 --> 11:19.544
>> oh, yeah.

11:19.546 --> 11:21.212
>> in a hotel lobby.

11:21.214 --> 11:24.049
We're about to do a pretty

11:24.051 --> 11:26.951
High-tech internet search.

11:26.953 --> 11:27.886
And i'm just not confident...

11:27.888 --> 11:28.553
>> wow.

11:28.555 --> 11:29.220
>> that my associate

11:29.222 --> 11:30.255
In this investigation

11:30.257 --> 11:31.556
Is gonna be much service.

11:31.558 --> 11:32.357
Could you just show everybody

11:32.359 --> 11:33.958
The phone that you're using?

11:33.960 --> 11:35.060
It's a 3, dude.

11:35.062 --> 11:35.794
You don't seem to have

11:35.796 --> 11:36.428
A tremendous amount

11:36.430 --> 11:39.297
Of appreciation for technology.

11:39.299 --> 11:40.432
Anyway, let's get back

11:40.434 --> 11:41.366
To our job here.

11:41.368 --> 11:43.201
>> let's do it.

11:43.203 --> 11:44.436
>> we've got a 28 year old...

11:44.438 --> 11:45.570
>> chitara.

11:45.572 --> 11:47.205
>> who had a six month

11:47.207 --> 11:49.641
Relationship with priscilla.

11:49.643 --> 11:51.042
They talked very intimately

11:51.044 --> 11:53.078
Exchanging thousands

11:53.080 --> 11:54.345
Of text messages.

11:54.347 --> 11:56.981
Sending sexy photos.

11:56.983 --> 11:59.050
Then, priscilla tells chitara

11:59.052 --> 12:00.251
She actually met a guy and

12:00.253 --> 12:02.287
Just sort of drops her.

12:02.289 --> 12:03.621
At which point priscilla

12:03.623 --> 12:05.690
Admits none of the relationship

12:05.692 --> 12:07.225
Has been real for her.

12:07.227 --> 12:10.295
She's faked the whole thing.

12:10.297 --> 12:11.196
Let's search

12:11.198 --> 12:12.464
Priscilla's pictures.

12:12.466 --> 12:13.465
Drag it in.

12:13.467 --> 12:14.132
>> no match.

12:14.134 --> 12:15.100
>> no match--okay,

12:15.102 --> 12:18.436
Let's try this next picture.

12:18.438 --> 12:19.671
Nope, no match.

12:19.673 --> 12:20.772
>> not at all her.

12:20.774 --> 12:21.439
You know what i think

12:21.441 --> 12:22.140
Our best bet

12:22.142 --> 12:23.041
Is to just check out

12:23.043 --> 12:25.110
The mocospace next.

12:25.112 --> 12:26.111
>> priscilla's mocospace

12:26.113 --> 12:27.112
Profile.

12:27.114 --> 12:30.014
Which is where she met chitara.

12:30.016 --> 12:33.218
Whoa, who is this?

12:33.220 --> 12:35.053
Kolani has been posting

12:35.055 --> 12:37.088
On priscilla's page a ton.

12:37.090 --> 12:40.592
Kolani wrote on priscilla's wall

12:40.594 --> 12:41.693
In may,

12:41.695 --> 12:44.462
Ovoo last night was too much.

12:44.464 --> 12:46.030
So, that's interesting 'cause

12:46.032 --> 12:49.200
If kolani ovooed with priscilla,

12:49.202 --> 12:50.502
That would mean that presumably

12:50.504 --> 12:53.204
Two actual individuals

12:53.206 --> 12:54.572
Were talking and maybe even

12:54.574 --> 12:56.674
Looking at each other.

12:56.676 --> 12:57.709
But then, why would she video

12:57.711 --> 12:59.043
Chat with this girl, kolani,

12:59.045 --> 13:00.145
And not chitara?

13:00.147 --> 13:00.812
>> it's absurd.

13:00.814 --> 13:01.513
>> let's check out

13:01.515 --> 13:03.581
Kolani's mocospace profile.

13:03.583 --> 13:05.316
Okay, "just an atlanta native

13:05.318 --> 13:06.284
Who loves dancing.

13:06.286 --> 13:07.719
I'm 20 years old.

13:07.721 --> 13:09.721
I'm a lesbian, so ladies

13:09.723 --> 13:11.122
You are more than welcome

13:11.124 --> 13:13.224
To hit me up."

13:13.226 --> 13:14.092
Okay, let's just do a search

13:14.094 --> 13:17.695
For kolani [bleep].

13:17.697 --> 13:21.199
Yeah, she's all over the place.

13:21.201 --> 13:22.000
Lot of images.

13:22.002 --> 13:22.734
She's got a twitter.

13:22.736 --> 13:23.568
Let's check that out

13:23.570 --> 13:26.104
Really fast.

13:26.106 --> 13:28.473
Wow, 29,000 followers.

13:28.475 --> 13:29.140
So, this girl

13:29.142 --> 13:30.642
Is, like, out there.

13:30.644 --> 13:32.710
Let's just do a facebook search.

13:32.712 --> 13:33.545
Oh, my god.

13:33.547 --> 13:35.413
There's a lot for this girl...

13:35.415 --> 13:36.447
>> a lot of people became...

13:36.449 --> 13:37.615
>> so, clearly, this girl

13:37.617 --> 13:39.017
Has a lot of fake profiles

13:39.019 --> 13:42.020
Of her 'cause there's a bunch.

13:42.022 --> 13:43.054
If this girl,

13:43.056 --> 13:45.089
Whoever she really is,

13:45.091 --> 13:47.158
Has a lot of fake profiles,

13:47.160 --> 13:48.026
I think it's safe

13:48.028 --> 13:49.727
To assume that the profile that

13:49.729 --> 13:51.629
We found of kolani on mocospace

13:51.631 --> 13:53.131
Is probably also fake.

13:53.133 --> 13:55.200
>> i actually had a friend

13:55.202 --> 13:56.201
In high school

13:56.203 --> 13:58.069
Who was dating this girl

13:58.071 --> 14:01.105
And she created a fake town

14:01.107 --> 14:03.441
With people where she pretended

14:03.443 --> 14:05.310
To be all these different people

14:05.312 --> 14:06.277
And they would, like,

14:06.279 --> 14:09.113
Comment on each other's walls

14:09.115 --> 14:10.582
And do all of these things

14:10.584 --> 14:11.316
On facebook.

14:11.318 --> 14:12.984
And it was really just her

14:12.986 --> 14:13.985
The entire time.

14:13.987 --> 14:15.653
>> right, so, it's possible

14:15.655 --> 14:16.921
That priscilla,

14:16.923 --> 14:18.189
Like your friend in high school,

14:18.191 --> 14:21.059
Also made up one or two others

14:21.061 --> 14:23.061
To make her seem legit.

14:23.063 --> 14:24.696
The person she talks to a lot,

14:24.698 --> 14:25.396
Kolani [bleep]...

14:25.398 --> 14:26.064
>> and the girl

14:26.066 --> 14:27.532
She also said she ovooed with.

14:27.534 --> 14:28.700
>> right?

14:28.702 --> 14:30.034
Is likely fake.

14:30.036 --> 14:31.369
Let's see, look.

14:31.371 --> 14:34.072
Kolani, profile was started the

14:34.074 --> 14:37.342
Same exact time as priscilla's.

14:37.344 --> 14:38.710
Last login.

14:38.712 --> 14:43.314
Priscilla, october 23rd.

14:43.316 --> 14:45.016
Kolani's last login...

14:45.018 --> 14:47.719
Both: October 23rd. That's not--

14:47.721 --> 14:48.853
>> yeah, yeah,

14:48.855 --> 14:49.654
That's not a coincidence.

14:49.656 --> 14:50.421
>> all right, so these pages

14:50.423 --> 14:51.155
Are definitely run

14:51.157 --> 14:52.090
By the same person.

14:52.092 --> 14:53.024
>> yes!

14:53.026 --> 14:53.725
>> yes, and if we know

14:53.727 --> 14:56.394
One of them is priscilla,

14:56.396 --> 14:58.563
Then she must be running

14:58.565 --> 14:59.597
Both of these pages.

14:59.599 --> 15:00.698
>> we got it--we got something.

15:00.700 --> 15:01.532
We got something.

15:01.534 --> 15:03.234
>> who is this girl, priscilla?

15:03.236 --> 15:04.402
And what would cause someone

15:04.404 --> 15:05.603
To completely cut off the person

15:05.605 --> 15:06.738
That they clearly

15:06.740 --> 15:07.739
Were passionately,

15:07.741 --> 15:08.840
Madly in love with?

15:16.749 --> 15:17.582
>> hey.

15:17.584 --> 15:19.684
>> have a look at this beautiful

15:19.686 --> 15:21.152
Picture window, right?

15:21.154 --> 15:21.986
>> wow, yeah.

15:21.988 --> 15:22.654
>> what a view?

15:22.656 --> 15:23.655
>> morning, alex.

15:23.657 --> 15:25.123
>> oh, god.

15:25.125 --> 15:27.091
>> let's go.

15:27.093 --> 15:28.693
Come on.

15:28.695 --> 15:31.729
We got to call chitara.

15:31.731 --> 15:32.630
It's gonna be comfortable

15:32.632 --> 15:35.667
To sleep on this bed tonight.

15:35.669 --> 15:36.634
>> all right.

15:36.636 --> 15:37.936
We need to check in

15:37.938 --> 15:39.037
With our girl.

15:39.039 --> 15:41.105
[phone dials]

15:41.107 --> 15:41.839
Hey, lady.

15:41.841 --> 15:43.141
>> hi!

15:43.143 --> 15:43.908
>> we wanted to sort of just

15:43.910 --> 15:44.575
Check in and see

15:44.577 --> 15:45.843
What you're up to.

15:55.988 --> 15:57.088
>> sounds like my kind

15:57.090 --> 15:58.156
Of afternoon activity.

15:58.158 --> 15:58.856
Is that cool

15:58.858 --> 16:02.360
If we meet you there?

16:02.362 --> 16:03.761
Oh, you're going down.

16:03.763 --> 16:04.429
>> oh, no.

16:04.431 --> 16:05.530
I'm beating you so bad

16:05.532 --> 16:06.397
On go-karts.

16:06.399 --> 16:07.165
>> you are going down.

16:07.167 --> 16:09.000
>> yeah?

16:09.002 --> 16:10.168
>> wonder who her friends are.

16:10.170 --> 16:10.969
>> i hope it's not, like,

16:10.971 --> 16:11.669
A whole bunch of, like,

16:11.671 --> 16:13.071
Girls my age so you can just

16:13.073 --> 16:15.273
Embarrass me the entire time.

16:15.275 --> 16:16.407
>> hope that her friends

16:16.409 --> 16:17.508
Can offer some good

16:17.510 --> 16:19.577
Insight into the situation.

16:19.579 --> 16:23.381
>> here we go.

16:23.383 --> 16:24.415
With the cameras, all good?

16:24.417 --> 16:26.017
>> no records.

16:26.019 --> 16:29.354
Let's go find our girl, chitara.

16:29.356 --> 16:30.188
Hey.

16:30.190 --> 16:31.723
>> hi!

16:31.725 --> 16:32.423
>> chitara!

16:32.425 --> 16:33.691
>> alex!

16:33.693 --> 16:35.159
>> let's get to know each other

16:35.161 --> 16:36.227
A little bit better by having

16:36.229 --> 16:39.197
Some fierce competition.

16:39.199 --> 16:41.599
>> i'm gonna beat nev.

16:46.739 --> 16:51.109
>> whoo!

16:51.111 --> 16:53.378
>> how do you do that?

16:53.380 --> 16:54.679
This is such [bleep].

16:54.681 --> 16:56.214
>> whoo!

16:56.216 --> 16:57.548
>> make up.

16:57.550 --> 16:58.916
>> technically, i didn't get

16:58.918 --> 17:01.085
A good start in the beginning.

17:01.087 --> 17:01.986
>> i'm over it, i'm done.

17:01.988 --> 17:03.021
I'm over it, come on.

17:03.023 --> 17:04.355
>> they said have fun!

17:04.357 --> 17:06.089
>> i'm over it, i'm done.

17:06.092 --> 17:07.925
>> so, when did you first

17:07.926 --> 17:09.327
Hear about priscilla?

17:09.329 --> 17:11.128
>> it came up in conversation.

17:11.131 --> 17:12.663
She hides a lot of things.

17:12.665 --> 17:14.565
>> not just relationship

17:14.567 --> 17:15.233
Stuff, but?

17:15.234 --> 17:16.601
>> no, i mean just things

17:16.603 --> 17:18.169
That go on with her.

17:18.171 --> 17:19.704
Family.

17:19.705 --> 17:20.405
>> i mean, i'm sure

17:20.406 --> 17:21.105
You can understand

17:21.107 --> 17:23.508
And appreciate her sensitivity

17:23.510 --> 17:25.343
Towards openly discussing

17:25.345 --> 17:27.712
Her bisexuality.

17:27.714 --> 17:29.947
>> i think as far as her family.

17:29.949 --> 17:31.182
I think her friends she was

17:31.184 --> 17:32.750
More open to telling everybody.

17:32.752 --> 17:33.584
'cause your friends

17:33.586 --> 17:35.119
Are not gonna judge you as much

17:35.121 --> 17:36.454
As your family is.

17:36.456 --> 17:38.122
For her to do this now,

17:38.124 --> 17:39.557
On national tv.

17:39.559 --> 17:40.725
She really,

17:40.727 --> 17:42.427
Really cares about priscilla.

17:42.429 --> 17:43.661
And...

17:43.663 --> 17:44.328
>> i mean, i

17:44.330 --> 17:45.630
Think she might still love her.

17:45.632 --> 17:46.631
>> she--i think she

17:46.633 --> 17:48.933
Does still have feelings.

17:48.935 --> 17:50.134
It may even come to the point

17:50.136 --> 17:51.369
Where she sees her

17:51.371 --> 17:54.539
And everything can be explained,

17:54.541 --> 17:55.440
She might still want

17:55.442 --> 17:56.140
To be with her.

17:56.142 --> 17:57.408
>> i think it is about love.

17:57.410 --> 17:58.543
Even though she says it's just

17:58.545 --> 17:59.377
About getting answers

17:59.379 --> 18:00.244
And closure.

18:00.246 --> 18:01.045
>> it's about love.

18:01.047 --> 18:01.746
>> right.

18:01.748 --> 18:03.081
>> people go above and beyond

18:03.083 --> 18:06.517
For love all the time.

18:06.519 --> 18:07.418
>> you got some good friends

18:07.420 --> 18:11.055
Here who clearly have your back.

18:11.057 --> 18:12.056
>> auntie, and pud.

18:12.058 --> 18:13.991
>> yeah, what did you guys

18:13.993 --> 18:14.992
Know about her?

18:14.994 --> 18:16.994
>> all i knew was

18:16.996 --> 18:18.629
It was somebody in her life

18:18.631 --> 18:22.300
That just put her in a funk.

18:22.302 --> 18:24.235
>> you should open up sometimes,

18:24.237 --> 18:25.470
You know?

18:25.472 --> 18:29.073
Don't keep it all inside.

18:29.075 --> 18:30.074
We're gonna take her, now.

18:30.076 --> 18:31.409
We've got a lot that we've been

18:31.411 --> 18:33.444
Doing research-wise

18:33.446 --> 18:35.012
In the last 24 hours.

18:35.014 --> 18:39.517
We got some stuff to talk about.

18:39.519 --> 18:41.586
>> oh, jesus.

18:45.224 --> 18:47.425
>> here we are.

18:47.427 --> 18:48.559
>> let's go back to where it all

18:48.561 --> 18:51.529
Started, which is mocospace.

18:51.531 --> 18:52.230
We went back

18:52.232 --> 18:54.632
To priscilla's profile.

18:54.634 --> 18:55.633
So, then we thought okay, let's

18:55.635 --> 18:56.667
Scroll down because there's,

18:56.669 --> 18:58.469
Like, a message board.

18:58.471 --> 19:00.071
So, the other person that we

19:00.073 --> 19:02.340
See posting a ton of comments...

19:02.342 --> 19:03.040
>> kolani.

19:03.042 --> 19:04.909
>> is kolani [bleep].

19:04.911 --> 19:05.776
>> i don't know if that name,

19:05.778 --> 19:06.611
You know, sounds familiar

19:06.613 --> 19:08.646
Or anything.

19:08.648 --> 19:10.615
>> no.

19:10.617 --> 19:12.984
>> this comment caught our eye.

19:12.986 --> 19:15.686
"ovoo last night was too much."

19:15.688 --> 19:17.288
Do you think if she's ovooed

19:17.290 --> 19:18.723
With kolani then--

19:18.725 --> 19:20.124
>> she's ovooed somebody,

19:20.126 --> 19:21.926
Video chatted with somebody.

19:21.928 --> 19:22.627
What's the issue

19:22.629 --> 19:23.694
With doing it with me?

19:23.696 --> 19:24.762
>> right--we thought, well,

19:24.764 --> 19:26.364
If kolani has seen her

19:26.366 --> 19:28.132
And knows it's her then this

19:28.134 --> 19:30.234
Actually could be priscilla.

19:30.236 --> 19:32.203
So, we did a search

19:32.205 --> 19:34.138
For kolani [bleep] on facebook

19:34.140 --> 19:38.376
And found dozens of profiles

19:38.378 --> 19:40.111
With the same pictures,

19:40.113 --> 19:41.279
Same name...

19:41.281 --> 19:42.246
>> name, yeah.

19:42.248 --> 19:44.582
>> crazy how many profiles

19:44.584 --> 19:46.017
This girl has of her.

19:46.019 --> 19:47.552
>> oh, wow.

19:47.554 --> 19:48.653
Okay.

19:48.655 --> 19:50.621
>> so, what does this mean?

19:50.623 --> 19:51.389
We went back

19:51.391 --> 19:53.724
To kolani's mocospace profile.

19:53.726 --> 19:55.126
And we were looking at it,

19:55.128 --> 19:56.460
And looking at it.

19:56.462 --> 19:58.362
But then we finally noticed

19:58.364 --> 20:00.164
Holy [bleep] the profile

20:00.166 --> 20:02.466
Was started the same exact time

20:02.468 --> 20:04.669
As priscilla's,

20:04.671 --> 20:05.970
And they have the exact

20:05.972 --> 20:11.209
Same last login.

20:11.211 --> 20:14.278
>> obviously, it's somebody

20:14.280 --> 20:16.614
Who has two profiles

20:16.616 --> 20:17.548
At least at once.

20:17.550 --> 20:19.250
>> at least.

20:19.252 --> 20:22.687
>> hm, but why?

20:22.689 --> 20:24.222
Like, what's--i guess

20:24.224 --> 20:25.990
What's the point of doing this?

20:25.992 --> 20:28.326
Like, what do you get out of it?

20:28.328 --> 20:29.227
Like, at the end of the day

20:29.229 --> 20:30.628
When you go to sleep at night,

20:30.630 --> 20:31.696
What do you get

20:31.698 --> 20:33.531
Out of doing this?

20:33.533 --> 20:35.132
>> i think she gets you

20:35.134 --> 20:36.634
Out of it.

20:36.636 --> 20:37.401
'cause she was going

20:37.403 --> 20:38.536
To sleep talking to you.

20:38.538 --> 20:39.570
And what i find most

20:39.572 --> 20:40.504
Crazy about this is

20:40.506 --> 20:42.673
She literally did this for you.

20:42.675 --> 20:43.674
She posted it

20:43.676 --> 20:45.977
From her other account

20:45.979 --> 20:49.280
And then commented on it.

20:49.282 --> 20:50.147
>> there's still a ton

20:50.149 --> 20:50.848
That we don't know.

20:50.850 --> 20:51.482
>> a ton?

20:51.484 --> 20:52.216
>> we don't really

20:52.218 --> 20:53.384
Know who priscilla is.

20:53.386 --> 20:54.085
>> yep.

20:54.087 --> 20:55.186
>> we don't really even know

20:55.188 --> 20:56.153
Where she lived.

20:56.155 --> 20:57.622
But what we do know

20:57.624 --> 20:58.522
Is that there's a very,

20:58.524 --> 20:59.557
Very high likelihood

20:59.559 --> 21:02.360
That her mocospace profile...

21:02.362 --> 21:03.461
>> and kolani [bleep].

21:03.463 --> 21:04.629
>> and kolani [bleep]

21:04.631 --> 21:06.430
Are both totally fake.

21:06.432 --> 21:07.632
It definitely suggests

21:07.634 --> 21:11.202
A very dark or twisted

21:11.204 --> 21:13.204
Mind game that this girl

21:13.206 --> 21:14.272
Was playing with you

21:14.274 --> 21:15.206
And potentially

21:15.208 --> 21:16.974
With other people also.

21:16.976 --> 21:18.175
>> now, more than anything

21:18.177 --> 21:19.277
I want answers.

21:19.279 --> 21:21.112
More so than i did before.

That we can start

21:34.294 --> 21:36.060
To get some real answers

21:36.062 --> 21:37.595
Is just to go straight

21:37.597 --> 21:39.230

>> yeah.

21:50.977 --> 21:53.044
>> what can we say that it'd be

21:53.046 --> 21:54.545
Good for her to tell the truth?

21:54.547 --> 21:55.946
That you really

21:55.948 --> 21:57.048
Need the closure?

21:57.050 --> 21:59.283

Wow.

22:02.121 --> 22:04.221

22:06.025 --> 22:07.124
From the mtv show,<i> catfish.</i>

22:07.126 --> 22:07.992
Chitara has gone through a lot

22:07.994 --> 22:09.493
Of trouble to try and meet you

22:09.495 --> 22:11.095
And has even solicited our help

22:11.097 --> 22:12.129
To make that happen.

22:12.131 --> 22:13.164
If you still care for her

22:13.166 --> 22:14.332
As much as it seems you once

22:14.334 --> 22:16.167
Did please contact me so we

22:16.169 --> 22:17.635
Can try and work something out.

22:17.637 --> 22:19.904
All right, well, here it goes.

22:19.906 --> 22:21.505
Now, i guess we just kinda

22:21.507 --> 22:23.074
Wait and see what happens.

22:23.076 --> 22:24.308
>> yeah.

22:24.310 --> 22:25.209
>> but right now the ball

22:25.211 --> 22:26.077
Is in her court.

22:39.992 --> 22:40.891
>> we have not heard

22:40.893 --> 22:42.526
Back from priscilla.

22:42.528 --> 22:43.361
>> she would definitely be,

22:43.363 --> 22:45.963
Like, you know, scared.

22:45.965 --> 22:48.099
>> we need to get this girl

22:48.101 --> 22:49.567
On the phone.

22:49.569 --> 22:51.936
The last time you called her,

22:51.938 --> 22:53.437
She answered?

22:53.439 --> 22:54.105
>> yeah.

22:54.107 --> 22:55.673
>> maybe you should call

22:55.675 --> 22:56.907
From your phone

22:56.909 --> 22:59.110
And if she sees that,

22:59.112 --> 23:02.513
That might be our best shot.

23:02.515 --> 23:03.381
>> i'll give it a shot.

23:03.383 --> 23:04.248
It's worth a try.

23:04.250 --> 23:06.083
>> it is worth a try.

23:11.556 --> 23:16.927
[phone dials]

23:21.500 --> 23:24.869
>> hello.

23:24.871 --> 23:27.037
Are you busy?

23:33.145 --> 23:36.480
No, it's not strange.

23:40.385 --> 23:41.886
He's standing right here

23:41.888 --> 23:43.454
With me.

23:43.456 --> 23:46.490
>> hello, is this priscilla?

23:46.492 --> 23:47.291
Hi, this is nev.

23:47.293 --> 23:49.627
I am here with chitara

23:49.629 --> 23:50.561
And you guys

23:50.563 --> 23:51.429
Seem to have something

23:51.431 --> 23:53.230
Very special and real.

23:53.232 --> 23:54.398
And so, we were wondering

23:54.400 --> 23:56.434
If maybe you'd be interested

23:56.436 --> 23:58.469
In taking an opportunity now

23:58.471 --> 24:01.138
To sit down and meet up

24:01.140 --> 24:03.407
And talk.

24:08.346 --> 24:09.213
>> don't make me flip out.

24:09.215 --> 24:09.980
>> okay,

24:09.982 --> 24:11.348
While you maybe feel

24:11.350 --> 24:12.650
Like your life has sort

24:12.652 --> 24:15.119
Of moved on and continued

24:15.121 --> 24:15.886
Since then.

24:15.888 --> 24:17.054
Chitara's feelings

24:17.056 --> 24:19.323
Are still kind of mixed up.

24:19.325 --> 24:21.192
And she just would love to get

24:21.194 --> 24:23.327
A chance to finally see you

24:23.329 --> 24:24.195
And talk to you.

24:24.197 --> 24:25.463
Which would be the thing

24:25.465 --> 24:26.931
That would help her kind of

24:26.933 --> 24:29.300
Move on.

24:38.477 --> 24:39.910
>> do you want to say something?

24:39.912 --> 24:41.011
>> no.

24:41.013 --> 24:42.480
>> obviously this is something

24:42.482 --> 24:43.647
That's important enough to her

24:43.649 --> 24:45.149
That she was willing

24:45.151 --> 24:47.051
To go on a tv show.

24:47.053 --> 24:49.286
And she's really kind of going

24:49.288 --> 24:50.988
Out of her comfort zone.

24:50.990 --> 24:51.956
It just seems

24:51.958 --> 24:52.623
Like the right thing

24:52.625 --> 24:54.091
To do to look each other

24:54.093 --> 24:54.959
In the eye,

24:54.961 --> 24:56.026
Say what you need to say

24:56.028 --> 25:00.064
And that would be it.

25:12.277 --> 25:15.179
Okay, great.

25:15.181 --> 25:15.946
All right, that's what

25:15.948 --> 25:18.215
We want, too.

25:18.217 --> 25:19.116
All right, so,

You okay?

25:32.431 --> 25:33.931
>> i'm good.

25:33.933 --> 25:34.965
>> you looked like you

25:34.967 --> 25:36.734
Were ready to burst.

25:36.736 --> 25:37.434
>> she made it seem

25:37.436 --> 25:39.003
Like i was thirsty.

25:39.005 --> 25:40.371
>> i understand, but i just...

25:40.373 --> 25:41.138
>> i don't like that.

25:41.140 --> 25:44.174
>> don't want her to get to you.

25:44.176 --> 25:45.376
Oh, i think she just texted me.

>> yeah, i know

30:13.946 --> 30:14.611
She was suspicious.

30:14.613 --> 30:15.279
>> there's no way

30:15.281 --> 30:15.946
For her to have known

30:15.948 --> 30:16.613
Who you actually were.

30:16.615 --> 30:17.881
So, the only way she would have

30:17.883 --> 30:19.149
Known that is if you had said,

30:19.151 --> 30:19.817
Like, look,

30:19.819 --> 30:20.484
I want to talk to you.

30:20.486 --> 30:21.151
>> when the only thing

30:21.153 --> 30:22.986
You had to do was say,

30:22.988 --> 30:24.955
And be honest with me, up front.

30:24.957 --> 30:27.024
I am not who i say i am.

30:27.026 --> 30:28.859
I am not 22.

30:28.861 --> 30:30.160
I am 18.

30:30.162 --> 30:30.828
>> okay.

30:30.830 --> 30:31.628
>> like, this [bleep]

30:31.630 --> 30:32.863
That you doing

30:32.865 --> 30:34.264
Is a dangerous game.

30:34.266 --> 30:34.965
Like, real talk.

30:34.967 --> 30:35.632
>> i understand.

30:35.634 --> 30:37.100
I don't do it anymore.

30:37.102 --> 30:37.835
You're the last one.

30:37.837 --> 30:38.569
I'm telling you, like,

30:38.571 --> 30:39.403
I'm through with everything.

30:39.405 --> 30:40.270
>> well, you know, i'm gonna

30:40.272 --> 30:41.238
Chalk all this up to the fact

30:41.240 --> 30:43.240
That you're 18.

30:43.242 --> 30:44.007
>> when did you turn 18?

30:44.009 --> 30:44.908
>> no, it's not to--

31:07.466 --> 31:08.165
>> i think it's hard

31:08.167 --> 31:09.366
For anybody.

31:09.368 --> 31:10.033
>> duh, we just

31:10.035 --> 31:10.868
Established that like,

31:10.870 --> 31:12.002
A couple minutes ago.

31:12.004 --> 31:12.836
>> i'm not talking to you.

31:12.838 --> 31:13.637
I'm having a conversation

How are you, you know?

31:59.351 --> 32:02.152

32:02.154 --> 32:03.287
This girl can't even sit

At the bar with me and drink.

32:16.235 --> 32:17.034
>> is there a story

32:17.036 --> 32:17.701
Or an explanation

32:17.703 --> 32:20.037
You want to kind of just offer

32:20.039 --> 32:20.837
Or do you have anything

32:20.839 --> 32:21.505
You want to say

32:21.507 --> 32:23.273
Since you're here now and?

32:23.275 --> 32:23.941
You can understand

32:23.943 --> 32:25.342
She's upset...

32:25.344 --> 32:26.310
>> i know she's upset.

32:26.312 --> 32:27.044
>> obviously, right?

32:27.046 --> 32:28.111
And so, she's just dealing

32:28.113 --> 32:28.946
With it in the way

32:28.948 --> 32:29.646
That she deals with it.

32:29.648 --> 32:30.814
>> i am--let me not say

I'm not mad.

32:36.021 --> 32:36.753
>> 'cause that's

32:36.755 --> 32:37.354
An understatement.

32:37.356 --> 32:38.322
This is a dangerous game

32:38.324 --> 32:39.222
She playing.

32:39.224 --> 32:40.557
A real dangerous game.

32:40.559 --> 32:42.526
>> you really did care for her.

32:42.528 --> 32:43.894
>> when you met her,

32:43.896 --> 32:45.562
It was as the priscilla profile?

32:45.564 --> 32:46.596
>> yes, as priscilla profile.

32:46.598 --> 32:48.131
>> which you created and had

32:48.133 --> 32:49.433
Been using for some time or?

32:49.435 --> 32:50.133
>> yeah, i've been

32:50.135 --> 32:51.535
Using fake profiles for a while.

32:51.537 --> 32:52.936
It all started when i was,

32:52.938 --> 32:56.239
Like, at least very young, 13.

32:56.241 --> 32:59.042
>> okay, so a story

32:59.044 --> 33:01.044
That you told her,

33:01.046 --> 33:02.179
You met somebody else?

33:02.181 --> 33:03.046
>> yeah, i met somebody

33:03.048 --> 33:04.414
Else early september.

33:04.416 --> 33:05.282
>> a guy?

33:05.284 --> 33:06.049
>> yeah.

33:06.051 --> 33:07.551
>> okay, so is that accurate?

33:07.553 --> 33:08.218
I mean--

33:08.220 --> 33:09.119
>> yeah, it's accurate.

33:09.121 --> 33:10.120
>> i'm sorry to ask this but,

33:10.122 --> 33:11.188
Like, some of the stories

33:11.190 --> 33:12.456
That you told her

33:12.458 --> 33:15.092
Regarding some family tragedies.

33:15.094 --> 33:16.159
That stuff's not true?

33:16.161 --> 33:17.127
>> that's some stuff

33:17.129 --> 33:19.029
I really not want to put.

33:19.031 --> 33:20.330
>> but your mom is...

33:20.332 --> 33:21.064
>> she's alive.

33:21.066 --> 33:21.732
>> healthy, and alive?

33:21.734 --> 33:22.466
>> yeah, she's alive,

33:22.468 --> 33:23.100
So that's--

33:23.102 --> 33:24.167
>> i'm glad to hear that 'cause

33:24.169 --> 33:25.435
I understand you told her

33:25.437 --> 33:26.303
That your mother passed away.

33:26.305 --> 33:27.604
>> mm-hmm.

33:27.606 --> 33:28.972
>> at this point i don't even

33:28.974 --> 33:30.974
Want answers to anything.

33:30.976 --> 33:33.076
I'm [bleep] done.

33:33.078 --> 33:33.877
>> you don't even?

33:33.879 --> 33:34.644
>> i don't even really

33:34.646 --> 33:35.379
Want to know, 'cause

33:35.381 --> 33:36.113
Obviously there's some

33:36.115 --> 33:40.751
[bleep] going on within her.

33:40.753 --> 33:41.651
>> sorry, i just can't believe

33:41.653 --> 33:42.819
I'm talking to you face to face.

33:42.821 --> 33:44.755
>> it would be different. Okay--

33:44.757 --> 33:45.422
>> i never thought

33:45.424 --> 33:46.356
I'd be on here, so.

33:46.358 --> 33:48.058
>> well, it can't come as

33:48.060 --> 33:48.992
Too much of a surprise.

33:48.994 --> 33:49.893
You've been creating

33:49.895 --> 33:50.827
Fake profiles for five years.

33:50.829 --> 33:51.695
>> i know, but i didn't think,

33:51.697 --> 33:52.396
Like, this would happen

33:52.398 --> 33:55.332
Right here.

33:55.334 --> 33:56.199
>> i would like to talk

33:56.201 --> 33:58.435
About maybe finding some time

33:58.437 --> 33:59.636
Tomorrow.

33:59.638 --> 34:01.972
I don't want the situation

34:01.974 --> 34:03.640
To end the way it ended.

34:03.642 --> 34:04.408
We'll figure something

34:04.410 --> 34:05.008
Out for tomorrow.

34:05.010 --> 34:06.009
>> okay, all right.

34:06.011 --> 34:07.677
Bye.

34:12.617 --> 34:15.085
>> wow, what a story.

34:20.024 --> 34:21.091
>> this is some very,

34:21.092 --> 34:22.391
Very immature stuff.

34:22.393 --> 34:23.960
There's something

34:23.962 --> 34:25.594
Not right there.

34:25.597 --> 34:27.130
Everything a lie.

34:27.132 --> 34:31.068
Everything.

34:31.070 --> 34:32.101
>> she definitely was trying

34:32.103 --> 34:32.969
To put it on you.

34:32.971 --> 34:37.040
>> do you feel like that was

34:37.042 --> 34:38.074
An ending to this?

34:38.077 --> 34:39.376
I don't.

34:39.378 --> 34:40.110
I think there's

34:40.112 --> 34:41.511
A very different person

34:41.513 --> 34:43.246
That we didn't meet today.

34:43.248 --> 34:44.114
>> this is something

34:44.116 --> 34:46.149
That she does continuous.

34:46.150 --> 34:48.051
This isn't like her first time.

34:48.053 --> 34:50.587
She's done this before.

34:50.589 --> 34:51.554
It's something

34:51.556 --> 34:54.357
Going on within her.

35:00.498 --> 35:01.932
>> this episode of <i> catfish:</i>

35:01.934 --> 35:04.468
<i>The tv show</i> continues now.

35:09.006 --> 35:10.340
[phone dials]

35:10.342 --> 35:11.108
>> hello?

35:11.110 --> 35:13.443
>> hello, ashanti?

35:13.445 --> 35:14.211
Hi, good morning.

35:14.213 --> 35:16.947
It's nev with chitara and we

35:16.949 --> 35:18.181
Were just discussing the idea

35:18.183 --> 35:19.282
Of coming to meet you if you're

35:19.284 --> 35:21.284
Willing to sit down with us

35:21.286 --> 35:23.286
And have a heart to heart.

35:26.724 --> 35:27.491
Great, see you

35:27.493 --> 35:28.692
In a little bit.

35:28.694 --> 35:30.794
All right, thanks.

35:30.796 --> 35:31.995
I think maybe if we

35:31.997 --> 35:33.396
Come at her in, like,

35:33.398 --> 35:35.432
A calmer approach.

35:35.434 --> 35:37.134
>> yeah, at that point

35:37.136 --> 35:40.003
I can better understand why she

35:40.005 --> 35:42.105
Would do some of these things.

35:42.107 --> 35:43.006
What was real?

35:43.008 --> 35:44.407
Like, what part of what you

35:44.409 --> 35:48.245
Told me was really real.

35:48.247 --> 35:49.913
>> okay.

35:49.915 --> 35:51.515
>> can it be where, like,

35:51.517 --> 35:53.116
Ya'll talk and i just take in

35:53.118 --> 35:54.017
Everything that she's saying...

35:54.019 --> 35:54.584
>> for sure.

35:54.586 --> 35:55.318
>> and then after she

35:55.320 --> 35:57.154
Finishes i can comment?

35:57.156 --> 35:58.088
>> for sure.

35:58.090 --> 36:00.624
>> okay, that'll work.

36:00.626 --> 36:03.160
>> okay, i think it's great that

36:03.162 --> 36:04.161
We can all sit down together

36:04.163 --> 36:05.962
And have a civil conversation.

36:05.964 --> 36:07.364
I feel like the ashanti

36:07.366 --> 36:08.064
We met yesterday

36:08.066 --> 36:10.333
Is not really who you are.

36:10.335 --> 36:12.068
>> mm-hmm.

36:12.070 --> 36:13.069
>> and yesterday

36:13.071 --> 36:14.271
We found out that perhaps one

36:14.273 --> 36:16.206
Of the most personal things

36:16.208 --> 36:17.073
About your mom

36:17.075 --> 36:18.141
Passing away wasn't true.

36:18.143 --> 36:20.310
So, now she's kind of totally...

36:20.312 --> 36:21.011
>> yeah, and i feel bad

36:21.013 --> 36:21.678
About that one, but--

36:21.680 --> 36:22.345
>> how can she know

36:22.347 --> 36:23.146
What's real or not real.

36:23.148 --> 36:23.813
>> i mean, i know i

36:23.815 --> 36:24.581
Shouldn't have done it.

36:24.583 --> 36:28.185
It's really bad, but yeah.

36:31.322 --> 36:32.289
>> over the last five years

36:32.291 --> 36:33.089
You've had a bunch

36:33.091 --> 36:34.057
Of different accounts.

36:34.059 --> 36:35.058
Most of them have been

36:35.060 --> 36:36.259
Using different pictures.

36:36.261 --> 36:37.294
>> mm-hmm.

36:37.296 --> 36:39.996
>> how many people would you say

36:39.998 --> 36:41.498
In that time you had,

36:41.500 --> 36:44.167
Like, a sincere connection with?

36:44.169 --> 36:45.101
>> not that many.

36:45.103 --> 36:47.070
>> how did those relationships,

36:47.072 --> 36:48.104
You know, end up?

36:48.106 --> 36:49.206
>> i would just,

36:49.208 --> 36:52.242
Like, i don't know, i got bored

36:52.244 --> 36:55.745
And decided to just move on.

36:55.747 --> 36:58.348
>> were they in love with you?

36:58.350 --> 37:00.183
>> i honestly don't know.

37:00.185 --> 37:04.854
Probably, but, you know?

37:07.058 --> 37:09.226
I did have feelings for you.

37:09.228 --> 37:10.293
I actually did,

37:10.295 --> 37:11.161
Even though i lied to you,

37:11.163 --> 37:13.496
I really did.

37:13.498 --> 37:14.631
I was actually able to, like,

37:14.633 --> 37:16.032
Talk about certain situations

37:16.034 --> 37:16.700
And things that were

37:16.702 --> 37:21.104
Bothering me.

37:21.106 --> 37:23.573
>> i just don't get it.

37:23.575 --> 37:25.742
>> sort of fill in all the holes

37:25.744 --> 37:28.478
For us about how you got here.

37:28.480 --> 37:30.180
>> when i was 13, it was

37:30.182 --> 37:31.781
A whole bunch of drama going on.

37:31.783 --> 37:32.515
And so, that's when,

37:32.517 --> 37:33.416
Like, basically my whole world

37:33.418 --> 37:35.752
Just fell apart.

37:35.754 --> 37:36.419
It was really hard

37:36.421 --> 37:37.487
Because there was a time

37:37.489 --> 37:39.256
Where i was separated

37:39.258 --> 37:40.090
From my mom.

37:40.092 --> 37:41.224
Around that time she was trying

37:41.226 --> 37:42.559
To find us a place to live.

37:42.561 --> 37:44.027
And so, you know,

37:44.029 --> 37:46.396
I decided one day, you know,

37:46.398 --> 37:47.731
Why not just escape and become

37:47.733 --> 37:49.699
Someone else for a day?

37:49.701 --> 37:50.634
So, that's when everything

37:50.636 --> 37:52.202
Really started.

37:52.204 --> 37:53.169
Like, you do anything

37:53.171 --> 37:56.740
Just to escape, you know?

37:56.742 --> 37:57.540
>> now, i understand

37:57.542 --> 37:59.109
A little bit more about

37:59.111 --> 38:01.044
Your situation with your family.

38:01.046 --> 38:02.279
What do you think

38:02.281 --> 38:03.213
About chitara and

38:03.215 --> 38:04.414
How she feels

38:04.416 --> 38:05.615
About this whole situation?

38:05.617 --> 38:07.284
>> i mean,

38:07.286 --> 38:08.451
I understand how she feels.

38:08.453 --> 38:10.153
I feel the same way, really.

38:10.155 --> 38:11.388
Like, just all the bad,

38:11.390 --> 38:12.722
Negative feelings.

38:12.724 --> 38:13.590
'cause i knew she didn't

38:13.592 --> 38:16.059
Deserve that, to be lied to.

38:16.061 --> 38:17.394
I was scared, you know,

38:17.396 --> 38:19.095
To actually, like confess

38:19.097 --> 38:21.164
And kind of reveal my real self.

38:27.772 --> 38:29.406
>> you can't keep running.

38:29.408 --> 38:31.174
At some point you

38:31.176 --> 38:33.109
Have to face whatever it is

38:33.111 --> 38:34.010
That you're going through,

38:34.012 --> 38:35.245
And if you don't

38:35.247 --> 38:37.047
It's a downhill spiral

38:37.049 --> 38:41.251
After that, so.

38:41.253 --> 38:44.287
>> i do appreciate it.

38:44.289 --> 38:45.789
>> you guys ready to go?

38:45.791 --> 38:46.690
>> yes.

38:46.692 --> 38:48.558
>> yeah.

38:50.428 --> 38:51.494
>> ♪ if you come to find out ♪

38:51.496 --> 38:53.797
♪ who you are ♪

38:53.799 --> 38:54.531
>> nice to meet you.

38:54.533 --> 38:55.198
>> it was nice to meet

38:55.200 --> 38:56.032
You too, nev.

38:56.034 --> 38:57.167
>> good luck with everything.

38:57.169 --> 38:58.068
>> all right, thank you.

38:58.070 --> 38:58.935
>> see you.

38:58.937 --> 38:59.736
>> good bye, everybody.

38:59.738 --> 39:01.204
>> see you later.

39:03.240 --> 39:05.308
>> ♪ and if you come search ♪

39:05.310 --> 39:07.277
♪ for what is lost ♪

39:07.279 --> 39:09.045
>> are you still mad?

39:09.047 --> 39:09.713
>> not mad.

39:09.715 --> 39:10.980
>> i thought you handled it

39:10.982 --> 39:13.350
Incredibly well in there.

39:13.352 --> 39:14.551
>> i guess the best answer

39:14.553 --> 39:15.652
I could say is why she

39:15.654 --> 39:18.488
Did was to escape reality.

39:18.490 --> 39:20.123
I guess that's the answer

39:20.125 --> 39:20.990
To it right there.

39:20.992 --> 39:21.758
Other than that,

39:21.760 --> 39:24.227
As to why go to this extent,

39:24.229 --> 39:27.664
And to involve other people

39:27.666 --> 39:28.765
In it?

39:28.767 --> 39:31.101
I don't think she knows why.

39:39.777 --> 39:42.011
>> oh, there we go, hey!

39:42.013 --> 39:42.679
>> hi!

39:42.681 --> 39:43.380
>> can you see us?

39:43.382 --> 39:44.314
How you doing?

39:44.316 --> 39:47.016
>> i'm doing great.

39:55.059 --> 39:56.659
When we walked away that day,

39:56.661 --> 39:57.627
That was it.

39:57.629 --> 39:58.361
It was said and done.

39:58.363 --> 40:00.163
And i kept it moving.

40:00.165 --> 40:01.097
>> so, you haven't really

40:01.099 --> 40:02.732
Thought about her or felt,

40:02.734 --> 40:03.867
Or, like, talked about it?

40:03.869 --> 40:04.534
>> i thought

40:04.536 --> 40:06.436
About the situation,

40:06.438 --> 40:08.905
But as far as her?

40:08.907 --> 40:10.173
No.

40:10.175 --> 40:11.307
Because if i could get it,

40:11.309 --> 40:12.308
Make it come back

40:12.310 --> 40:13.209
And the same thing

40:13.211 --> 40:14.544
Can happen again my resolution

40:14.546 --> 40:15.578
Is just, you know,

40:15.580 --> 40:17.213
Do better, get better.

40:17.215 --> 40:18.047
I'ma get there.

40:18.049 --> 40:19.349
>> all right, well, i got to go.

40:19.351 --> 40:20.350
>> nice to speak to you,

40:20.352 --> 40:22.085
And nice to see you, alex.

40:22.087 --> 40:23.286
>> good seeing both of you guys.

40:23.288 --> 40:24.120
>> all right.

40:24.122 --> 40:25.355
>> bye.

40:35.566 --> 40:37.500
>> the most beautiful girl

40:37.502 --> 40:38.868
I've ever seen.

40:38.870 --> 40:39.869
>> i do have a feeling

40:39.871 --> 40:41.271
That this could be the one

40:41.273 --> 40:42.505
That i end up spending my life

40:42.507 --> 40:43.940
With.

40:43.942 --> 40:46.743
>> double catfish scheme?

40:46.745 --> 40:47.410
>> all right,

40:47.412 --> 40:49.846
Get ready for anything.

40:49.848 --> 40:51.381
>> wait, this could be our guy.

40:51.383 --> 40:52.515
I'm a little confused.

40:52.517 --> 40:53.450
What do you think

40:53.452 --> 40:54.517
Is gonna happen?
