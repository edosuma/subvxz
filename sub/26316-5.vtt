WEBVTT

00:05.465 --> 00:06.716
What the hell is that?

00:07.258 --> 00:09.135
Oh! Hey, guys.

00:09.594 --> 00:10.929
What are you doing down here?

00:11.012 --> 00:13.056
Well, we came to get more champagne

00:13.139 --> 00:15.266
which is right behind... that magic door.

00:19.395 --> 00:21.439
- What door?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! What's going on?

00:21.564 --> 00:23.691
Who are you, and why were you
talking about us?

00:23.775 --> 00:26.319
And what's the "good place,"
and what are "afterlife points"

00:26.361 --> 00:28.113
and who has the most and... is it me?

00:28.154 --> 00:31.199
Wait a second, I know this guy!
You're Zack Pizazz!

00:31.282 --> 00:32.784
He got me here from Jacksonville.

00:32.826 --> 00:36.079
No, this is the librarian,
from the University.

00:36.162 --> 00:39.749
Well, I know him as Gordon Indigo,
a very rude Silicon Valley investor.

00:39.874 --> 00:41.292
Alright, guys.

00:41.334 --> 00:44.420
I can explain everything.
Just give me one second, OK?

00:45.630 --> 00:46.756
How do we get out of this?

00:46.840 --> 00:49.592
Well, they heard us explaining
the entire system of the afterlife

00:49.676 --> 00:52.846
and they saw an interdimensional door
open and close, so...

00:53.388 --> 00:54.848
not a ton of wiggle room here.

00:54.889 --> 00:58.309
But, you're forgetting one crucial piece
of information.

01:00.395 --> 01:01.396
Right?

01:01.604 --> 01:04.357
I mean, you're forgetting one crucial piece
of information, that'll save us?

01:04.440 --> 01:08.486
Yo! Buddy! You have like three seconds
to explain this crazy space door

01:08.570 --> 01:09.946
or Chidi here is gonna beat you up!

01:10.071 --> 01:11.948
- Yes!
- Oh, no... I'm... I'm... I'm not

01:12.073 --> 01:14.534
but I would like to know
about the space door.

01:15.285 --> 01:18.872
Alright. I don't know what choice we have.
I'll tell you the truth.

01:21.249 --> 01:23.543
My name is Special Agent Rick Justice.

01:23.626 --> 01:25.461
And this is Lisa "Frenchy" Fuqua.

01:25.587 --> 01:29.757
We're with the FBI,
and all of you are in grave danger.

01:32.051 --> 01:33.052
I knew it.

01:39.934 --> 01:43.313
Agent Fuqua and I are...
paranormal investigators.

01:43.646 --> 01:45.148
We're here to protect you from...

01:46.274 --> 01:49.819
demons. No, wait, that's real... um...
ghouls... ghouls!

01:50.403 --> 01:53.323
We're here to protect you from ghouls.
Now I had to appear...

01:53.406 --> 01:55.617
in different disguises to keep tabs on you

01:55.742 --> 01:58.453
but you are all involved together...

01:58.536 --> 01:59.996
in this FBI case.

02:00.079 --> 02:02.332
No, we can... we can... prove this.

02:02.749 --> 02:04.667
We have detailed files on all of you.

02:04.751 --> 02:06.294
Ask Janet anything.

02:06.419 --> 02:07.962
- Who's Janet?
- "Frenchy".

02:08.004 --> 02:09.964
- Frenchy.
- Sorry...

02:10.048 --> 02:12.133
"Frenchy's" nickname is Janet.

02:12.217 --> 02:13.509
I thought her nickname was "Frenchy".

02:14.135 --> 02:15.053
It is.

02:15.762 --> 02:16.971
That's why they call her...

02:17.430 --> 02:20.266
- Lisa "Double Nickname" Fuqua.
- Mm-hm.

02:20.391 --> 02:24.729
OK. Guys, I used to work at a place that
was raided by the FBI pretty frequently.

02:25.063 --> 02:29.234
I know a Fed when I see one
and these two "jamokes" are not FBI, OK?

02:30.068 --> 02:31.027
Who are you?

02:31.861 --> 02:33.488
- Really.
- Fine, fine, fine.

02:33.613 --> 02:35.990
- Just give me one more second.
- One.

02:36.157 --> 02:37.575
- Serious question?
- Yep?

02:38.201 --> 02:39.452
- Should we kill them?
- What?

02:39.661 --> 02:40.578
It might work!

02:41.329 --> 02:42.914
We kill them, go back through the door

02:42.997 --> 02:45.500
somehow grab them
before they get to the Bad Place

02:45.541 --> 02:47.961
and regroup from there.
I could kill them right now.

02:48.044 --> 02:51.047
And you know, it would be easy.
Their bodies are very poorly made.

02:51.130 --> 02:53.007
They're mostly goo and juice.

02:53.049 --> 02:55.176
You just take the juice out
and then they're dead.

02:55.343 --> 02:56.302
Michael...

02:56.427 --> 02:58.471
they've seen through the door
into the afterlife

02:58.554 --> 03:00.014
and they heard how it works.

03:01.182 --> 03:02.725
It's over.

03:04.519 --> 03:05.603
Ah...

03:09.482 --> 03:10.441
Fine.

03:11.776 --> 03:12.986
Guess, I'll start at the beginning.

03:14.362 --> 03:15.697
You all died.

03:22.662 --> 03:24.080
Well, this sucks.

03:24.247 --> 03:26.332
So, to sum up...

03:26.958 --> 03:29.377
there is a heaven and hell

03:29.877 --> 03:31.796
we've been to hell and...

03:32.588 --> 03:35.258
now, no matter how good we are
for the rest of our lives

03:35.341 --> 03:37.260
we're going back to hell.

03:37.302 --> 03:40.138
Again, it's not the classic
Christian "hell", but...

03:41.097 --> 03:42.473
that's the gist, yes.

03:42.724 --> 03:44.809
As soon as you learned about the afterlife

03:45.018 --> 03:48.730
your motivation to be good was corrupted...

03:49.647 --> 03:51.190
so you can't earn points anymore.

03:51.774 --> 03:55.111
So sorry for eternally dooming you.

03:55.194 --> 03:56.946
And that's our bad, guys.

03:57.030 --> 03:58.906
So, all the attempts you made to...

03:59.824 --> 04:03.369
torture us, we must have been
in the afterlife for a hundred years.

04:03.578 --> 04:05.163
Almost three hundred, actually.

04:05.246 --> 04:07.206
Well, how is it possible that all these
things happened to us

04:07.290 --> 04:08.333
but no time passed on Earth?

04:08.416 --> 04:10.752
Did you go back in time to save us?

04:11.044 --> 04:12.503
Uh, I didn't have to

04:12.587 --> 04:14.589
because of "Jeremy Bearimy".

04:15.923 --> 04:17.425
Who's Jeremy Bearimy?

04:18.343 --> 04:21.721
OK, things in the afterlife don't happen

04:22.347 --> 04:24.307
"while" things are happening here

04:24.390 --> 04:28.061
because while time on Earth moves
in a straight line

04:28.770 --> 04:31.397
one thing happens, then the next,
then the next...

04:31.481 --> 04:35.818
Time in the afterlife moves
in a "Jeremy Bearimy."

04:36.069 --> 04:37.320
What?

04:37.528 --> 04:41.991
The afterlife time doubles back and loops
around and ends up looking something, like...

04:43.326 --> 04:44.744
"Jeremy Bearimy".

04:44.952 --> 04:47.497
This is the timeline in the afterlife.

04:47.914 --> 04:51.834
Happens to kinda look like the name
"Jeremy Bearimy" in cursive English

04:51.918 --> 04:53.586
so that's what we call it.

04:53.836 --> 04:56.672
Sorry, I'm... my brain is melting.

04:56.756 --> 05:03.221
How can events happen before
the ones that happened... before?

05:03.679 --> 05:07.225
Just the way it works. It's...
it's "Jeremy Bearimy."

05:07.850 --> 05:10.686
I don't know what to tell you.
That's the easiest way to describe it.

05:10.812 --> 05:11.938
OK, but, um...

05:13.314 --> 05:15.900
what the hell is this?
The dot over the "I".

05:16.109 --> 05:17.944
- The hell is that?
- OK, um...

05:18.528 --> 05:20.113
how do I explain this concisely?

05:20.363 --> 05:22.990
This is Tuesdays...

05:24.367 --> 05:26.577
- and also July.
- And sometimes it's never.

05:26.702 --> 05:28.788
That's true.
Occasionally, that moment...

05:28.871 --> 05:32.166
on the "Bearimy" timeline
is the time-moment

05:32.208 --> 05:34.961
when nothing "never" occurs.

05:35.670 --> 05:36.671
So...

05:37.547 --> 05:38.423
you get it?

05:39.424 --> 05:40.800
This broke me, uh...

05:41.551 --> 05:43.386
The dot over the "I".

05:43.428 --> 05:44.887
That broke me, I'm...

05:45.972 --> 05:47.098
I'm done.

05:47.265 --> 05:49.725
You know what?
I'm glad this whole thing happened

05:49.767 --> 05:53.771
because now I can go back to living
my life the way I used to

05:54.147 --> 05:57.024
only caring about myself,
because being good is pointless.

05:57.108 --> 05:59.944
- No, no. Ah, please, Eleanor, just...
- No, thank you. I'm outtie.

06:00.027 --> 06:01.154
See ya in hell.

06:01.279 --> 06:03.364
You know what I just realised?

06:03.406 --> 06:05.658
I always say that when leaving a room

06:05.741 --> 06:07.994
but right now, it's accurate!

06:08.369 --> 06:12.123
I will literally see all of you in hell!

06:12.248 --> 06:13.749
Not if I see you first!

06:14.333 --> 06:15.293
Let's go, Jason.

06:15.501 --> 06:18.337
No, no, look, look!
You guys, this is not over!

06:18.421 --> 06:20.965
We have to stay together.
Look, we'll figure something out!

06:21.048 --> 06:24.218
Like, just one idea I had,
I could kill all of you!

06:27.180 --> 06:28.306
That's my birthday.

06:31.184 --> 06:35.813
Hey, buddy, it's my birthday.
One free margarita please!

06:36.147 --> 06:37.356
Well, happy birthday!

06:37.440 --> 06:38.858
- Can I just see some ID?
- No.

06:39.150 --> 06:41.944
- Why not?
- Well, because it's not really my birthday,

06:42.028 --> 06:43.196
I just want a free margarita.

06:43.654 --> 06:47.033
Well, if I just randomly gave you a free
drink, I'd have to do it for everyone.

06:47.074 --> 06:48.284
Pretty soon I'd go out of business.

06:48.326 --> 06:50.328
Then don't do it for everyone.

06:50.411 --> 06:52.747
Just do it for me because it's my birthday!

06:53.414 --> 06:54.332
Happy Birthday.

06:57.043 --> 06:59.420
Jason, I have an idea but...

06:59.754 --> 07:00.755
It's a little risky.

07:00.838 --> 07:02.548
I need you to act as my bodyguard

07:02.632 --> 07:05.510
like my friend, Kevin Costner,
in that movie where <i>he</i> was a bodyguard.

07:06.177 --> 07:07.136
<i>The Bodyguard.</i>

07:07.220 --> 07:09.889
No problem. My cousin once hired me
to do crowd control

07:09.972 --> 07:11.015
for his off-brand Sea World.

07:11.098 --> 07:14.852
Well, technically, it was just a bunch
of kiddie pools full of jellyfish.

07:14.936 --> 07:17.647
And instead of a killer whale,
they killed a whale.

07:19.941 --> 07:21.275
Excuse me, miss.

07:21.359 --> 07:23.694
We'd like to buy one opera, please!

07:23.778 --> 07:29.075
Uh... what he means is "I would like to give
two million dollars to the Sydney Opera".

07:29.158 --> 07:31.077
Miss Al-Jamil, this is...

07:31.536 --> 07:34.080
so generous.
With a donation of that size

07:34.205 --> 07:36.874
we will dedicate our rehearsal hall
in your honour.

07:36.958 --> 07:38.042
Thank you, but no.

07:38.125 --> 07:42.213
Lovely as it sounds to add to my collection
of wings and atria

07:42.296 --> 07:43.839
the gift will be anonymous.

07:43.923 --> 07:45.967
As you wish. I'll draw up the papers.

07:47.677 --> 07:49.971
Why don't you want your name
on the opera house?

07:50.054 --> 07:51.472
I love getting my name on stuff!

07:51.639 --> 07:54.100
In Jacksonville, I got a flu virus named
after me

07:54.183 --> 07:55.643
cos I kissed a bat on a dare.

07:55.935 --> 07:58.813
Well, I was thinking about
why I was sent to hell

07:58.896 --> 08:02.441
as one is wont to do when one has recently
been told that one had been sent to hell

08:02.817 --> 08:05.861
and it occurred to me,
I have always been held captive

08:05.903 --> 08:07.697
by my desire for attention.

08:08.239 --> 08:09.740
Now that I know how it all ends

08:09.991 --> 08:12.451
I just want to be virtuous,
for virtue's sake.

08:12.743 --> 08:13.953
That's beautiful.

08:14.245 --> 08:16.455
I gotta say, though,
if you want to do more charity

08:17.206 --> 08:18.791
I know a way that could be a lot of fun!

08:25.256 --> 08:27.300
Hey. Do you wanna talk to God?

08:27.675 --> 08:28.634
"God is dead.

08:29.051 --> 08:31.012
God remains dead.
And we have killed him.

08:31.554 --> 08:33.764
Who will wipe this blood off us?

08:33.931 --> 08:39.812
What festivals of atonement,
what sacred games shall we have to invent?"

08:40.313 --> 08:42.106
Friedrich Nietzsche, 1882.

08:42.481 --> 08:44.525
I was just trying to sell you some drugs
and you made it weird.

09:01.417 --> 09:03.044
I've never written a manifesto before.

09:03.586 --> 09:05.838
What are you gonna say?
It'll be a complete account

09:05.921 --> 09:07.298
of everything we've learned

09:07.673 --> 09:10.009
from the beginning
of my Neighbourhood to right now.

09:10.092 --> 09:11.594
- Mm...
- And then a recommendation

09:11.719 --> 09:14.305
of how we feel
the afterlife could be improved.

09:14.889 --> 09:17.141
When we turn ourselves in,
we'll give it to the Judge

09:17.475 --> 09:18.684
and hopefully she'll read it.

09:20.311 --> 09:21.479
We've failed, Janet.

09:22.355 --> 09:25.066
But maybe one day someone
else will succeed.

09:26.275 --> 09:27.485
OK, so...

09:29.153 --> 09:30.112
A...

09:31.030 --> 09:32.073
Ma...

09:32.365 --> 09:33.449
ni...

09:33.699 --> 09:34.909
fes...

09:35.368 --> 09:36.410
to.

09:37.203 --> 09:38.120
By...

09:38.412 --> 09:40.373
Mi...

09:40.790 --> 09:41.874
Where's the "H"?

09:42.333 --> 09:44.126
- This keyboard doesn't have an "H".
- Well...

09:44.210 --> 09:46.170
Oh, oh, wait, wait, wait...
I see it. I see it.

09:48.756 --> 09:50.883
- Oh, no, no, no. Look what I did!
- Yeah.

09:50.925 --> 09:52.885
I wrote "Micahel".

09:52.968 --> 09:55.888
Oh, that's...
OK, back, back, back, back, back.

09:55.971 --> 09:57.932
Maybe you should dictate and I should type.

10:00.142 --> 10:01.143
Good call

10:01.560 --> 10:03.104
Just laying out some early details.

10:03.688 --> 10:04.980
Go ahead and start dictating.

10:06.732 --> 10:09.443
Look, there have to be rules.
Every place has rules.

10:09.527 --> 10:11.237
Ugh! Fine, here are my rules...

10:11.278 --> 10:15.241
Rule number one, I get to do whatever
I want and you all just have to deal with it.

10:15.282 --> 10:17.952
Rule two, no more Spider-Man movies!

10:17.993 --> 10:19.870
There's way too many Spider-Man movies.

10:19.995 --> 10:22.206
Too many dorky little twerpy Spider-men.

10:23.207 --> 10:26.210
Rule three, everyone leave me alone.

10:27.086 --> 10:28.671
So you just take care of yourself

10:28.713 --> 10:31.006
you don't owe anything to anyone else?

10:31.048 --> 10:33.008
If people lived that way,
society would break down.

10:33.092 --> 10:35.636
Yeah! In America everyone does
whatever they want

10:35.761 --> 10:38.931
society did break down, it's terrible,
and it's great!

10:39.223 --> 10:40.683
You only look out for Number One

10:40.766 --> 10:42.685
scream at whoever disagrees with you.

10:42.727 --> 10:45.354
There are no bees because they all died

10:45.396 --> 10:48.023
and if you need surgery
you just beg for money on the internet.

10:48.107 --> 10:49.275
It's a perfect system!

10:49.483 --> 10:51.527
Now get me another drink.
Tomorrow's my birthday.

10:53.696 --> 10:57.116
Well, well, well, a wallet.

10:58.909 --> 11:03.122
My rules say I get to take the cash out
and keep it, because in my society

11:03.205 --> 11:05.124
I do whatever I want cos I'm awesome.

11:09.211 --> 11:10.212
Just take it.

11:10.713 --> 11:12.423
Take it, Eleanor. Just...

11:13.507 --> 11:14.508
Ugh!

11:15.801 --> 11:18.888
Alright, this is the address on the licence.
That'll be 58 bucks.

11:18.971 --> 11:22.308
Keep the meter running, as soon as I'm done
here I'm gonna head to the airport

11:22.349 --> 11:23.809
get the hell out of this trash country

11:23.893 --> 11:26.562
where everyone is either
a criminal or a spider.

11:28.814 --> 11:31.400
Hello, ma'am.
Is there a Fred Booth here?

11:31.484 --> 11:35.654
I found his wallet, and now I'm doing a nice
thing and returning it, because I suck.

11:35.738 --> 11:38.616
Sorry, he moved. I can give you his new
address if you'd like?

11:39.074 --> 11:40.993
Actually, I have some of his mail.

11:41.076 --> 11:42.745
If you're gonna go see him
could you bring it along?

11:43.162 --> 11:46.749
Of course, I would love
to bring some "rando" his mail.

11:47.124 --> 11:48.793
Anything else you want me to schlep over?

11:50.503 --> 11:52.713
Well, this awesome day gets "awesomer."

11:53.798 --> 11:56.884
Before the airport, we're heading
to 78 Palmer Street.

11:57.176 --> 11:59.470
Ha! That's right next to the bar
where I picked you up!

11:59.762 --> 12:02.014
I feel like a bloody boomerang!

12:02.598 --> 12:03.808
Of course you do.

12:20.991 --> 12:22.243
- Uh...
- Hello.

12:22.576 --> 12:24.703
Sir, you, uh... can't shop here
without a shirt.

12:25.079 --> 12:26.038
Oh.

12:36.757 --> 12:39.385
Sir, that'll be 880 dollars.

12:39.718 --> 12:40.761
Here's my credit card.

12:40.803 --> 12:43.264
Why don't you just charge it,
and keep it forever?

12:43.556 --> 12:45.975
And, also, here's the keys to my car.

12:46.308 --> 12:48.602
Wait, do you guys have, like,
a "take a car, leave a car" tray?

12:49.270 --> 12:51.897
No? You know, just take it. Just take it.

12:54.441 --> 12:56.944
Excuse me, sir?
Would you like some free money?

12:57.778 --> 12:59.822
Now you can buy fingers for your gloves.

13:00.322 --> 13:02.032
Hello, Madam. Are you poor?

13:02.533 --> 13:04.368
Here's 5,000 dollars for a new stroller.

13:04.410 --> 13:05.494
Have a nice day!

13:05.828 --> 13:07.913
You don't have to say
the "are you poor?" part.

13:07.955 --> 13:08.831
Right.

13:08.914 --> 13:10.207
Hello! Here's some money.

13:10.332 --> 13:11.417
- Here you go.
- Hello.

13:11.500 --> 13:12.710
Here you go.

13:12.793 --> 13:14.503
Now you can buy a bigger chin guitar.

13:16.380 --> 13:18.591
This was a truly great plan.

13:18.674 --> 13:19.758
Ah, thanks.

13:20.759 --> 13:23.804
Man, there are so many times
that just this amount of money

13:24.054 --> 13:25.264
would have changed my life.

13:25.764 --> 13:27.349
I could have paid my rent.

13:27.433 --> 13:29.059
I could've gone to a real doctor

13:29.143 --> 13:31.937
instead of pretending
I was a big dog so I could go to the vet.

13:33.772 --> 13:35.691
You know, that gives me an idea.

13:36.817 --> 13:38.235
Which I suppose, one could argue means

13:38.319 --> 13:39.987
that anything could've given me an idea.

13:40.654 --> 13:41.614
Come with me.

13:42.531 --> 13:44.491
I'm sorry, Miss Al-Jamil

13:44.575 --> 13:46.410
but I just don't feel comfortable

13:46.493 --> 13:47.620
processing this request.

13:47.786 --> 13:50.497
- Why not?
- Well, it just seems a bit... odd

13:50.956 --> 13:53.709
to transfer the totality of your account

13:53.792 --> 13:57.588
131 million British pounds
to the account of...

13:58.172 --> 13:59.089
this person...

13:59.965 --> 14:03.969
a man who is so flagrantly ignoring
the "one lollipop per customer" rule.

14:04.094 --> 14:07.514
No, I walked out and back in each time,
so I'm "different" customers.

14:08.766 --> 14:10.893
We're technically supposed to shut down
the bank

14:10.976 --> 14:13.187
if anyone from Florida even walks in.

14:13.562 --> 14:16.857
Look, all my life this money has been
a weight around my neck.

14:17.149 --> 14:20.110
Like the Heart of the Ocean necklace
my friend James Cameron once gave me.

14:20.778 --> 14:22.655
I don't want the money.
My friend Jason does.

14:22.863 --> 14:24.448
I would like to give it to him.

14:24.531 --> 14:27.201
If it's easier, you can just put it
on a Game Stop gift card.

14:27.868 --> 14:29.662
That does not make it "easier."

14:30.037 --> 14:31.622
I can't help you. I'm sorry.

14:35.834 --> 14:36.794
- G'day.
- Fred?

14:37.044 --> 14:39.254
My name is Eleanor Shellstrop.
I have all your crap.

14:40.923 --> 14:42.883
- Thank you!
- And your wallet.

14:43.175 --> 14:44.468
Oh, my goodness!

14:44.927 --> 14:47.596
- Thank you so much!
- It was nothing.

14:48.764 --> 14:51.809
Dude, I didn't take your money.
I would never even think of doing that.

14:51.892 --> 14:53.602
No, no, no, I'm not worried about that.

14:53.894 --> 14:55.688
Ah, here it is.

14:57.314 --> 14:59.358
I started a new job
a few months ago and...

14:59.942 --> 15:01.026
I got really nervous.

15:01.360 --> 15:04.530
So my daughter Carolyn drew this for me,
to make me feel better.

15:04.655 --> 15:05.990
Ah, it's my good luck charm.

15:06.490 --> 15:09.118
Every time I'm stressed at work now,
I just have to look at this

15:09.743 --> 15:10.911
and I feel...

15:10.953 --> 15:11.870
you know... safe.

15:12.538 --> 15:15.374
Look, a lot of people wouldn't
have tried so hard to get this to me.

15:16.041 --> 15:17.668
You are a good person, Eleanor.

15:18.335 --> 15:20.963
I really hope my daughter turns out
like you when she grows up.

15:22.840 --> 15:25.259
- Are you alright?
- No, <i>you</i> shut up!

15:26.135 --> 15:27.761
Sorry. It's been a weird day.

15:30.347 --> 15:33.600
<i>♪ You put the Peeps in the chili pot,
and eat them both up ♪</i>

15:33.684 --> 15:37.146
<i>♪ You put the Peeps in the chili pot,
and add the M&Ms ♪</i>

15:37.312 --> 15:41.775
You put the Peeps in the chili pot,
It makes it taste... bad!

15:42.317 --> 15:44.361
I'm gonna eat all this chili

15:45.195 --> 15:47.865
and/or die trying.

15:48.323 --> 15:49.366
Anyone want any?

15:49.450 --> 15:51.285
I'm just gonna put it right down here.

15:51.785 --> 15:53.787
Come on. Dip your balls in my chili.

15:54.288 --> 15:56.373
Scoop your little mittens
right in the stew.

15:56.457 --> 15:57.666
Professor?

15:57.750 --> 16:00.753
I can see that you're going through
something, but exams are next week.

16:00.836 --> 16:02.755
So can you teach us anything?

16:03.213 --> 16:04.840
Alright, nerd.

16:05.007 --> 16:07.301
You want to learn something?
I'll teach you something.

16:07.634 --> 16:09.511
I'm gonna teach you the meaning of life.

16:09.553 --> 16:11.138
How do ya like them apples?

16:11.263 --> 16:15.225
Now over the last, 25 hundred years

16:15.350 --> 16:20.189
Western philosophers have formed three
main theories on how to live an ethical life.

16:20.481 --> 16:22.858
Now first off, there's "virtue ethics."

16:23.400 --> 16:26.695
Aristotle believed that there were
certain virtues

16:26.779 --> 16:28.864
of mind and character, like courage...

16:28.989 --> 16:33.368
or generosity, and you should try to develop
yourself in accordance with those virtues.

16:33.952 --> 16:35.412
The gift will be anonymous.

16:35.704 --> 16:37.831
Next, there's consequentialism.

16:38.207 --> 16:41.794
The basis for judgment about whether
something is right or wrong

16:41.835 --> 16:45.005
stems from the consequences of that action.

16:45.130 --> 16:48.092
How much utility, or
good, did it accomplish

16:48.175 --> 16:50.094
versus how much pain, or bad.

16:50.177 --> 16:52.346
And finally, there's deontology -

16:52.513 --> 16:57.601
the school of thought that there are strict
rules and duties that everyone must adhere to

16:57.851 --> 16:58.977
in a functioning society.

16:59.061 --> 17:02.564
Being ethical is simply identifying
and obeying those duties

17:02.773 --> 17:04.525
and following those rules.

17:04.691 --> 17:06.318
But here's the thing,
my little chili babies

17:06.527 --> 17:09.446
all three of those theories are hot,
stinky, cat "dookie".

17:09.905 --> 17:11.990
The true meaning of life

17:12.449 --> 17:16.286
the actual ethical system
that you should all follow

17:16.537 --> 17:17.579
is nihilism.

17:18.080 --> 17:21.041
The world is empty.

17:21.458 --> 17:24.294
There is no point to anything

17:24.336 --> 17:25.921
and you're just gonna die.

17:26.964 --> 17:28.173
So do whatever!

17:28.674 --> 17:32.803
And now, I'm gonna eat my marshmallow
candy chili in silence

17:32.886 --> 17:37.182
and you all can jump up your own butts.

17:38.016 --> 17:40.227
- Is that going to be on the test?
- Yes.

17:40.811 --> 17:41.687
And no.

17:42.229 --> 17:44.022
And you all get "A"s or "F"s.

17:44.356 --> 17:45.524
And there is no test.

17:45.649 --> 17:47.526
And you all failed it,
and you all got "A"s.

17:47.860 --> 17:48.861
Who cares?

17:49.319 --> 17:50.362
Goodbye.

17:50.904 --> 17:54.575
Good-byeeeeeeee.

17:59.454 --> 18:00.372
Cool lecture.

18:01.331 --> 18:02.416
And cooler shirt.

18:03.292 --> 18:04.251
Feeling alright?

18:04.501 --> 18:05.419
I feel fine.

18:05.627 --> 18:07.546
- Mm...
- I do have a stomach ache.

18:07.921 --> 18:10.549
Why do I always have a stomach ache?

18:10.674 --> 18:13.302
Well, you just ate 50 pounds of chilli, bro,
this one's on you.

18:13.510 --> 18:16.430
Look, I know the future seems bleak

18:16.763 --> 18:18.015
but I have a plan.

18:18.473 --> 18:19.433
Come with me.

18:22.019 --> 18:23.604
Nah-ah-ah! Leave that chilli, weirdo.

18:25.939 --> 18:30.527
A complete account of every single thing
we've done and learned.

18:30.569 --> 18:34.948
I added all the data we've gathered
here on Earth, in chart and graph form.

18:35.032 --> 18:39.578
And I added a pretty tasty little recipe
for cinnamon rolls made out of pizza dough.

18:39.661 --> 18:40.621
Ha!

18:41.830 --> 18:45.083
Maybe someone, someday,
can learn from our mistakes

18:45.500 --> 18:49.254
and enact real change in the process
of judging people.

18:50.214 --> 18:53.175
But, for now Janet, old friend

18:53.508 --> 18:55.802
we are going to enjoy our time on Earth

18:56.261 --> 18:57.512
before we're retired.

18:57.721 --> 18:59.139
- Hm.
- So, let's get started.

18:59.556 --> 19:00.724
I know it's touristy

19:01.058 --> 19:03.644
but I'd really like to visit
a lens crafters.

19:03.852 --> 19:05.562
Ooh, and I'd like to get bangs.

19:05.604 --> 19:07.689
Hey, guys!

19:08.315 --> 19:10.525
It... it's really nice to see you, um...

19:10.984 --> 19:12.319
is everything OK?

19:12.361 --> 19:14.446
Other than, you know... everything?

19:14.780 --> 19:17.241
We've started to accept our fates.

19:17.950 --> 19:19.326
It's all chilli under the bridge.

19:20.535 --> 19:22.162
Oh, good. You're all here.

19:22.329 --> 19:23.372
Big news everyone!

19:23.580 --> 19:26.166
- We got married!
- We got tacos!

19:26.750 --> 19:29.628
Oh, oh yeah. We got married
and then after we got married

19:29.962 --> 19:32.839
- we got tacos!
- Wow!

19:33.257 --> 19:35.759
Wow, that's crazy!

19:35.842 --> 19:37.636
Well, it's strictly platonic, of course.

19:37.928 --> 19:41.348
We only did it so I could
legally give Jason half my money.

19:41.556 --> 19:44.142
We just popped over to the British Embassy
and signed the papers.

19:44.226 --> 19:46.561
That's insane, but it's also, like...

19:47.062 --> 19:49.856
the eleventh most insane thing
to happen today, so...

19:50.107 --> 19:52.192
who cares?
I need everyone to focus up.

19:52.609 --> 19:54.194
So, the four of us...

19:56.196 --> 19:58.407
the six of us, really, are doomed.

19:59.199 --> 20:00.534
Our fates are sealed.

20:00.951 --> 20:02.452
But I think we have one move left.

20:03.412 --> 20:04.538
We can try.

20:05.247 --> 20:06.498
Try what?

20:07.291 --> 20:08.583
Try to do good.

20:09.543 --> 20:12.379
That stupid little voice in my head
told me to do something good today

20:12.462 --> 20:13.547
and it was so annoying

20:13.630 --> 20:18.176
but it also made a dork and his very
untalented daughter super happy.

20:19.094 --> 20:22.848
Me trying, just a little bit,
put some good out into the world.

20:23.348 --> 20:26.268
The six of us are not getting in
to the Good Place.

20:26.643 --> 20:29.730
But there are still people in this world
that we care about

20:30.022 --> 20:33.734
so I say we try and help
<i>them</i> be good people.

20:33.817 --> 20:35.110
Try and help them get in.

20:35.152 --> 20:36.570
I mean, why not try?

20:36.653 --> 20:38.488
It's better than not trying, right?

20:38.947 --> 20:40.449
That's a lovely sentiment, Eleanor.

20:41.533 --> 20:42.576
Let's try.

20:42.993 --> 20:44.286
- I'm in.
- I'm in too.

20:45.037 --> 20:47.622
I'm gonna remember this day forever
because of your dope speech.

20:47.998 --> 20:49.750
And also because of the great tacos I had

20:50.042 --> 20:52.627
and also because I got married
and I found out I was going to hell

20:52.711 --> 20:55.213
- and also I became a hundred millionaire.
- Alright, we get it. We get it.

20:55.297 --> 20:56.965
It goes without saying
that we're in.

20:57.674 --> 20:58.800
Let's say it anyway.

20:59.176 --> 21:00.844
- We're i-- Alright, you go.
- We're--

21:01.053 --> 21:03.930
- We're i--
- We're in! We're just so excited.

21:04.181 --> 21:05.057
We're in!

21:05.557 --> 21:08.101
What do you say, bud?
You want to join the soul squad?

21:08.185 --> 21:09.519
Try to save some souls?

21:10.145 --> 21:11.772
Yeah, I'm in.

21:12.481 --> 21:15.650
But first, I have to go
to the bathroom forever.

21:16.735 --> 21:17.778
There you are, my love!

21:18.487 --> 21:21.198
I was just on my way to the MRI lab,
thought I heard your voice.

21:22.240 --> 21:24.701
Ready to go to the airport?
Start our lives together?

21:26.745 --> 21:28.830
Go ahead Tahani, we're rolling.
