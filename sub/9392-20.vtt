All right, ladies,

00:35.503 --> 00:37.269
let's pick teams
for dodgeball.

00:37.271 --> 00:38.370
Connie, would you like
to be a captain?

00:38.372 --> 00:39.471
Sure.

00:39.473 --> 00:41.473
I pick everyone
except Meg.

00:41.475 --> 00:43.175
Fair enough. Go!
(blows whistle)

00:43.177 --> 00:45.878
(yelling)

00:45.880 --> 00:48.113
Oww!

00:48.115 --> 00:50.249
(whirring)

00:55.488 --> 00:57.990
(bell rings)

00:57.992 --> 00:59.792
Hey, where's
everybody going?

00:59.794 --> 01:02.094
That's not how we end
this class.

01:03.029 --> 01:04.163
Good job today.

01:04.165 --> 01:05.798
Good job today.

01:05.800 --> 01:07.032
Great class.

01:07.034 --> 01:08.367
Nice hustle.

01:11.771 --> 01:13.439
Hey, how was
gym class?

01:13.441 --> 01:14.506
Terrible.

01:14.508 --> 01:15.507
You know, I don't think
I can take

01:15.509 --> 01:16.809
another semester
at this school, Ruth.

01:16.811 --> 01:18.110
It's torture.

01:18.112 --> 01:21.046
It's worse than sitting
next to a baby on an airplane.

01:22.215 --> 01:23.982
So what brings you
to Kentucky?

01:23.984 --> 01:24.983
I'm visiting my family.

01:24.985 --> 01:26.685
Ah, family man.

01:26.687 --> 01:29.021
Me? Single
and ready to mingle.

01:29.023 --> 01:32.024
Tom Brunell's the name.
Insurance is the game.

01:32.026 --> 01:35.861
And right now,
the game is <i>very</i> good to me.

01:35.863 --> 01:36.995
Hey, I know!

01:36.997 --> 01:38.130
If you hate it
so much here,

01:38.132 --> 01:38.931
why don't you
come to Paris

01:38.933 --> 01:40.632
for a semester
with me instead?

01:40.634 --> 01:41.767
I'm leaving next week.

01:41.769 --> 01:43.469
You're going to Paris
for a semester?

01:43.471 --> 01:45.537
Yeah, it's a program
sponsored by the high school.

01:45.539 --> 01:47.172
My aunt even has
an apartment there

01:47.174 --> 01:48.841
that we can stay in
for free.

01:48.843 --> 01:51.176
Oh, my God,
that sounds so amazing!

01:51.178 --> 01:52.845
Excuse me,
I was wondering

01:52.847 --> 01:55.347
if you would go to the dance
with me on Friday.

01:55.349 --> 01:57.015
Chris, it's me, Meg.

01:57.017 --> 01:57.816
(sighing)

01:57.818 --> 01:58.984
Well, that's everybody.

02:03.289 --> 02:06.525
TV ANNOUNCER:
to <i>Ethiopian Hoarders.</i>

02:06.527 --> 02:10.028
(sobbing):
how it got like this!

02:10.030 --> 02:11.363
Dad, Mom,

02:11.365 --> 02:12.931
there's something
I want to ask you.

02:12.933 --> 02:14.133
Can I go to school
in Paris

02:14.135 --> 02:15.134
for a semester?

02:15.136 --> 02:16.535
What? Paris?

02:16.537 --> 02:18.270
Hey, you know,
I have a pen pal in Paris.

02:18.272 --> 02:19.972
Would you mind bringing him
this letter?

02:19.974 --> 02:21.940
(hocking phlegm)

02:21.942 --> 02:23.041
We're fighting.

02:23.043 --> 02:25.777
Meg, I'd love to send you
to Paris for a semester,

02:25.779 --> 02:27.146
but we can't afford that.

02:27.148 --> 02:28.313
But I can pay
for it myself.

02:28.315 --> 02:30.048
I've been saving up
from all my part-time jobs.

02:30.050 --> 02:31.517
That's smart of you, Meg.

02:31.519 --> 02:32.751
You know, sometimes I do

02:32.753 --> 02:35.187
part-time jobs
for extra cash.

02:36.156 --> 02:37.856
Gimme money. Gimme money.
(violin screeching)

02:37.858 --> 02:39.091
Gimme money. Gimme money.
Gimme money.

02:46.332 --> 02:48.000
You be careful,
sweetie,

02:48.002 --> 02:49.801
and call us as soon
as the plane lands.

02:49.803 --> 02:51.003
Okay, Mom, I will.

02:51.005 --> 02:52.371
I'll miss you, Dad.

02:52.373 --> 02:54.673
I've never been very good
at saying good-bee.

02:54.675 --> 02:56.341
Good-bee, Meg.

02:56.343 --> 02:57.776
And I'm gonna
bring you back

02:57.778 --> 02:59.478
something special,
little guy.

02:59.480 --> 03:01.947
Don't worry about me.
Just get yourself laid.

03:01.949 --> 03:04.016
Will you get me
French Stewart's autograph?

03:04.018 --> 03:05.817
Say hello
to the Pont Neuf for me,

03:05.819 --> 03:07.953
or as I like to call it,
my inspiration point...

03:07.955 --> 03:09.087
Oh, you're gone.

03:09.089 --> 03:10.722
And the family's gone.

03:16.296 --> 03:17.996
(tires screeching)

03:17.998 --> 03:20.599
Oh, my God, we're
actually here in Paris.

03:20.601 --> 03:23.035
This is so exciting!

03:23.037 --> 03:24.369
(French accent):
Good day, foreigners.

03:24.371 --> 03:27.339
On behalf of the country
of France, we surrender.

03:27.341 --> 03:29.841
Oh, my God,
I love your breath.

03:29.843 --> 03:30.976
Hi, I'm Meg.

03:30.978 --> 03:33.145
This is my friend, Ruth.

03:33.147 --> 03:35.147
Would you ladies
like to share a cab,

03:35.149 --> 03:37.983
or as we say,
"sharre a cabbuh"?

03:37.985 --> 03:38.984
Sure.

03:38.986 --> 03:40.152
That sounds great.

03:40.154 --> 03:42.087
Oh, and please
do not be suspicious

03:42.089 --> 03:43.789
that I am
at the airport

03:43.791 --> 03:45.757
with no baggage
whatsoever.

03:47.327 --> 03:50.662
A cool name to say
with a French accent

03:50.664 --> 03:52.664
is Ashtahn Kootchere.

03:55.835 --> 03:56.635
Bye!

03:56.637 --> 03:57.869
Thanks!

04:01.140 --> 04:02.207
Hey, it's me.

04:02.209 --> 04:04.009
I've got
some fresh arrivals for you.

04:04.011 --> 04:05.711
How are they?

04:05.713 --> 04:07.312
On a scale from <i>un</i> to <i>dix,</i>

04:07.314 --> 04:10.382
they're about a <i>trois.</i>

04:11.384 --> 04:13.352
Wow, this place
is awesome!

04:13.354 --> 04:14.653
I know!

04:14.655 --> 04:16.922
Hey, you wanna dance around
like morons to loud music?

04:16.924 --> 04:17.923
(rock music playing)

04:17.925 --> 04:19.191
I'll be right back.

04:19.193 --> 04:21.927
I've been holding in
a dump since America.

04:25.131 --> 04:26.265
(phone ringing)

04:26.267 --> 04:28.000
Griffin residence.

04:28.002 --> 04:29.268
Hi, Dad, it's me.

04:29.270 --> 04:31.169
Just wanted you to know
I got here safe.

04:31.171 --> 04:32.004
(alarmed):
And sound?

04:32.006 --> 04:34.139
Yes, Dad, and sound.

04:34.141 --> 04:35.207
(relieved):
Oh, good.

04:35.209 --> 04:37.009
The "sound" is what concerns me.

04:37.011 --> 04:39.011
Oh, it's so
amazing here, Dad.
Yep.

04:39.013 --> 04:40.646
You should see it.
Uh-huh.

04:40.648 --> 04:42.214
The apartment we're
staying in is huge,
Uh-huh.

04:42.216 --> 04:43.849
and has
an incredible view of...
Uh-huh.

04:43.851 --> 04:44.816
(gasping)

04:44.818 --> 04:46.018
Dad, something's
going on.

04:46.020 --> 04:47.419
Some men just broke in.

04:50.023 --> 04:51.823
(gasps) Oh, my God!
They've got Ruth!

04:51.825 --> 04:52.924
(footsteps approaching)

04:52.926 --> 04:55.460
And now, I think
they're coming after me!

04:55.462 --> 04:56.662
(serious):
All right, Meg,

04:56.664 --> 04:58.997
I need you to listen to me
very carefully:

04:58.999 --> 05:00.098
panic.

05:00.100 --> 05:01.466
Pay no attention to detail.

05:01.468 --> 05:03.168
Let your mind race.

05:03.170 --> 05:04.936
Take short, rapid breaths.

05:04.938 --> 05:06.638
Then hide under the bed,

05:06.640 --> 05:08.840
but leave two of your feet
sticking out.

05:10.510 --> 05:12.110
(footsteps approaching)

05:14.947 --> 05:16.048
(whispering):
Oh, my God, Dad!

05:16.050 --> 05:17.949
Are they gonna take me?
I'm so scared!

05:17.951 --> 05:19.384
(screaming)

05:19.386 --> 05:21.086
Meg? Meg?

05:21.088 --> 05:25.357
(man breathing heavily)

05:25.359 --> 05:28.527
I don't know who you are.
I don't know what you want.

05:28.529 --> 05:31.496
But I have a very particular
lack of skills.

05:31.498 --> 05:34.032
I will never be able
to find you,

05:34.034 --> 05:36.101
but what I do have
is two dollars

05:36.103 --> 05:37.536
and a Casio wristwatch.

05:37.538 --> 05:39.338
You can have one of them.

05:39.340 --> 05:41.940
(deep, menacing voice):
Drakkar Noir.

05:41.942 --> 05:43.175
(hangs up)

05:43.177 --> 05:44.710
These guys are serious.

05:44.712 --> 05:46.578
Lois, Meg's dead!

05:49.549 --> 05:52.117
Please, there's gotta be
something you can do!

05:52.119 --> 05:54.486
My little girl is
in terrible danger!

05:54.488 --> 05:55.987
Ma'am, the men
who took your daughter

05:55.989 --> 05:57.255
are most likely members

05:57.257 --> 05:59.191
of a sophisticated network
of human smugglers.

05:59.193 --> 06:01.259
If she's not found
within 96 hours,

06:01.261 --> 06:03.595
chances are
she's gone forever.

06:03.597 --> 06:05.030
Then we've gotta hurry!

06:05.032 --> 06:06.465
Sorry, we can't
begin our search

06:06.467 --> 06:08.767
until she's been missing
for 96 hours.

06:08.769 --> 06:10.936
Oh, my God! My baby!

06:10.938 --> 06:13.004
Yeah, there's a pretty grisly
sex trade over there.

06:13.006 --> 06:15.807
Usually we just end up
burying framed pictures.

06:15.809 --> 06:17.776
Oh, Peter!
This is a nightmare!

06:17.778 --> 06:19.911
(sobbing)

06:21.347 --> 06:22.981
What's going on
down there?

06:22.983 --> 06:24.049
Are they gonna
find her?

06:24.051 --> 06:25.150
Doesn't look good.

06:25.152 --> 06:26.985
Stewie, I think
there's only one way

06:26.987 --> 06:28.587
we're ever gonna
see Meg again.

06:28.589 --> 06:30.822
You and I have to take matters
into our own hands.

06:30.824 --> 06:32.257
What? What are you
talking about?

06:32.259 --> 06:33.992
Look, you're the only one
who's got the know-how

06:33.994 --> 06:35.927
and the technology
to help us track her down.

06:35.929 --> 06:37.462
Hmm. Interesting.

06:37.464 --> 06:39.598
Last week, all my gadgets
were "hooey,"

06:39.600 --> 06:40.799
I think was the word.

06:40.801 --> 06:42.834
I didn't say...
You said "hooey"!

06:42.836 --> 06:43.969
All right, I've booked us
on a flight

06:43.971 --> 06:45.637
that leaves in two hours,

06:45.639 --> 06:47.973
so, um, whose credit card
shall we put it on?

06:47.975 --> 06:49.841
Just put it on yours
and I'll pay you back.

06:49.843 --> 06:51.209
Yeah, I feel like
when that happens,

06:51.211 --> 06:52.711
I sometimes don't
get paid back.

06:52.713 --> 06:53.945
Like when?

06:53.947 --> 06:56.314
Jersey Boys, Morton's
Steakhouse, Foxwoods...

06:56.316 --> 06:58.550
Foxwoods and <i>Jersey Boys</i>
<i>was the same trip!</i>

06:58.552 --> 06:59.951
(sighing):
You know what? Fine.

06:59.953 --> 07:01.787
I'll-I'll put it
on my card,

07:01.789 --> 07:03.321
but I-I-I'm just gonna say
it's a gift

07:03.323 --> 07:05.424
because that's the only way
I can do this anymore.

07:11.431 --> 07:13.331
All right, the first thing
we've got to do when we land

07:13.333 --> 07:15.200
is check the apartment
where Meg was abducted

07:15.202 --> 07:16.668
and see if we can find
some clues.

07:16.670 --> 07:18.336
That sounds good.
That's what I was thinking.

07:18.338 --> 07:20.539
Excuse me, do you mind
if we switch seats

07:20.541 --> 07:22.541
so my family can sit
all together?

07:22.543 --> 07:24.643
No, we don't...
we-we don't switch.

07:24.645 --> 07:25.977
'Cause when we booked,

07:25.979 --> 07:27.345
they didn't have
three together...

07:27.347 --> 07:28.980
Ma'am, ma'am,
your poor planning

07:28.982 --> 07:30.949
does not constitute
an emergency for me.

07:30.951 --> 07:33.885
You'll see him in Paris.
Go sit down.

07:33.887 --> 07:36.321
God, Meg's kidnappers could be
anywhere in France by now.

07:36.323 --> 07:38.190
Well, we do have
one lead, Brian.

07:38.192 --> 07:40.459
I have a recording
of the kidnapper's voice.

07:40.461 --> 07:41.993
What? You do? How?

07:41.995 --> 07:43.595
I recorded
the kidnapper's phone call

07:43.597 --> 07:44.763
with the fat man.

07:44.765 --> 07:46.131
You see, Brian,
I record

07:46.133 --> 07:48.500
all phone calls coming in
or out of the house.

07:48.502 --> 07:50.101
Y-Y-You do?

07:50.103 --> 07:52.204
Yep. This one's
one of my faves.

07:52.206 --> 07:55.474
WOMAN:
Hello, Fundamental Industries.
How can I help you?

07:55.476 --> 07:57.142
BRIAN:
Yeah, um, is this...
is this Bang Brothers?

07:57.144 --> 07:58.944
WOMAN:
Yes.

07:58.946 --> 08:01.446
BRIAN:
Oh. Okay.I-I-I'd like
to cancel my subscription.

08:01.448 --> 08:02.647
WOMAN:
Uh, what's your name?

08:02.649 --> 08:03.949
BRIAN:
Brian Griffin.

08:03.951 --> 08:05.317
WOMAN:
And which site
did you belong to?

08:05.319 --> 08:07.953
BRIAN:
Uh... Captain Stabbin'.

08:07.955 --> 08:09.454
WOMAN:
And how are you spelling that?

08:09.456 --> 08:11.756
BRIAN:
Uh... uh, "Captain", full word,

08:11.758 --> 08:14.926
then "Stabbin',"
S-T-A-B-B-I-N apostrophe.

08:14.928 --> 08:18.330
WOMAN:
Okay, I'm checking.

08:18.332 --> 08:22.133
BRIAN:
You know, in-instead
of a "G" at the end.

08:22.135 --> 08:23.668
WOMAN:
I'm sorry, sir.
I'm not finding that site.

08:23.670 --> 08:25.370
Uh, what was the subject matter?

08:25.372 --> 08:28.139
BRIAN:
Um... a guy
doing chicks on a boat

08:28.141 --> 08:29.975
in a, uh, captain's hat.

08:29.977 --> 08:31.943
WOMAN:
Okay, I'm checking.

08:31.945 --> 08:33.879
BRIAN:
The, um...
(clearing throat)

08:33.881 --> 08:35.647
the, passengers had, uh,
just signed up

08:35.649 --> 08:37.015
for a tour of the harbor

08:37.017 --> 08:39.184
and then
all that stuff happened.

08:39.186 --> 08:41.019
Okay, you made
your point.

08:45.324 --> 08:47.192
(tires screeching)

08:48.828 --> 08:50.428
Well, this is where
Meg was staying.

08:50.430 --> 08:52.764
Oh. I thought Paris would be
a bit more picturesque.

08:52.766 --> 08:54.032
Instead it's just traffic

08:54.034 --> 08:56.301
and some big guy
using a jackhammer.

08:56.303 --> 08:58.703
But monsieur,
ziss is not a jackhammer.

08:58.705 --> 09:00.639
It is a "Jacqueshammer."

09:00.641 --> 09:04.142
Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-
ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-

09:04.144 --> 09:06.511
ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-
ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho...

09:08.681 --> 09:10.515
Oh, God, it's worse
than I imagined.

09:10.517 --> 09:11.850
You know, maybe
it'd help

09:11.852 --> 09:13.852
if we just tried
to track Meg's movements

09:13.854 --> 09:15.120
from the moment
she arrived in France.

09:15.122 --> 09:16.354
That's a good idea, Brian.

09:16.356 --> 09:17.822
Let's try Google Earth.

09:17.824 --> 09:19.024
Worth a shot.

09:21.027 --> 09:22.861
There. Enhance.

09:29.268 --> 09:31.169
Wow, I never knew you could
do this on a computer.

09:31.171 --> 09:33.305
'Course not, you spend
all your time on this

09:33.307 --> 09:34.940
watching Captain Stabbin'.

09:34.942 --> 09:36.841
All right, we've got
to find this man.

09:36.843 --> 09:38.944
Let's see, this was
taken at the airport.

09:38.946 --> 09:40.478
He could be
some sort of lookout

09:40.480 --> 09:42.280
who spots girls
fresh off the plane.

09:42.282 --> 09:44.482
Yes, you're probably right,
Brian. Such scum.

09:44.484 --> 09:46.117
I'll bet they target
young girls

09:46.119 --> 09:48.620
the way Army commercials
target minorities.

09:48.622 --> 09:49.821
Hey.

09:49.823 --> 09:51.256
Other black guys.

09:51.258 --> 09:53.091
It ain't so bad.

10:00.266 --> 10:02.167
Oh, my God, Stewie!
There he is!

10:02.169 --> 10:03.935
Hey, buddy, we've got
a few questions for you!

10:03.937 --> 10:07.939
Excuse me, but this is
a "smoking only" area.

10:07.941 --> 10:09.774
Oh, sorry.
Do you have a, uh...

10:12.144 --> 10:15.614
You know, I really only smoke
when I drink.

10:15.616 --> 10:17.983
Oh. Well, this is nice.

10:17.985 --> 10:20.151
This is a nice way
to do this.

10:20.153 --> 10:22.921
Look, we need to know:
have you seen this girl?

10:23.956 --> 10:26.157
Quick!
He's getting away!

10:28.928 --> 10:30.929
Oh, no, he's one of those
parkour, free-running guys.

10:30.931 --> 10:32.731
We'll never catch him!

10:36.602 --> 10:38.036
(horn blaring)

10:38.038 --> 10:39.137
(gasping)

10:39.139 --> 10:42.707
(weakly):
Oh, no. I have
chateau'ed myself.

10:42.709 --> 10:44.442
(groaning)

10:44.444 --> 10:47.045
Damn it. He died before he could
tell us anything.

10:47.047 --> 10:48.046
Brian, he's
the first guy.

10:48.048 --> 10:49.681
The first guy
always dies.

10:49.683 --> 10:51.149
Well, I'm sure
he didn't work alone.

10:51.151 --> 10:52.784
Maybe there's something
in here we can use.

10:52.786 --> 10:55.020
(Velcro ripping)
Ugh, this guy has
a Velcro wallet.

10:55.022 --> 10:56.254
Grow up.

10:59.925 --> 11:02.193
All right, this is the address
that was in his wallet.

11:02.195 --> 11:03.662
Yeah, but how are we
gonna know for sure

11:03.664 --> 11:04.929
if these are the guys
who took Meg?

11:04.931 --> 11:07.766
Well, we have the kidnapper's
voice on tape, remember?

11:07.768 --> 11:09.434
(deep, menacing voice):
Drakkar Noir.

11:09.436 --> 11:11.469
I can use the voice
recognition software

11:11.471 --> 11:13.271
in this recorder
to confirm a match.

11:13.273 --> 11:14.272
Now, here.

11:14.274 --> 11:15.840
Take this briefcase.

11:16.876 --> 11:18.343
We're Eastern European
cologne salesmen.

11:18.345 --> 11:19.811
We ask them
what they want,

11:19.813 --> 11:21.446
and when they say
"Drakkar Noir"--

11:21.448 --> 11:22.480
which they all will--

11:22.482 --> 11:24.349
we'll know
if we have our man.

11:25.317 --> 11:27.018
MAN:
Drakkar Noir?

11:27.987 --> 11:29.054
(buzzer sounding)

11:29.056 --> 11:29.954
All right, well,
that's not him,

11:29.956 --> 11:31.890
but this is
gonna be easy.

11:34.493 --> 11:36.127
Well, gentlemen,
now that you have smelled

11:36.129 --> 11:38.363
all of our colognes,
what'll it be?

11:38.365 --> 11:40.198
I will take
some Drakkar Noir.

11:41.934 --> 11:43.134
How 'bout you?

11:43.136 --> 11:44.269
I am disgusting,

11:44.271 --> 11:46.604
so I will take
two bottle Drakkar Noir.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.040
How 'bout you, chief?

11:49.042 --> 11:50.108
Hmm.

11:50.110 --> 11:52.577
Let me quickly grow beard
and think about it.

11:54.980 --> 11:56.614
I will take
Drakkar Noir.

12:11.964 --> 12:13.465
(both grunting)

12:13.467 --> 12:14.833
What the hell
are you doing?!

12:14.835 --> 12:15.967
We haven't eaten
since the plane.

12:15.969 --> 12:17.202
I'm starving.

12:27.046 --> 12:28.279
Where is this girl?

12:28.281 --> 12:29.681
Where is she?!

12:29.683 --> 12:31.015
We keep girls upstairs.

12:31.017 --> 12:32.884
I hope you burn in hell
along with the guy

12:32.886 --> 12:35.820
who came up with
stuffing a turkey.

12:35.822 --> 12:37.188
Hey!

12:37.190 --> 12:40.225
Who wants to try
some of my "Butthole Bread"?

12:41.961 --> 12:43.128
Meg?

12:43.130 --> 12:44.195
Meg?

12:46.031 --> 12:47.999
Help... me.

12:48.001 --> 12:50.635
Oh, we're here to help
somebody else, sweetheart.

12:50.637 --> 12:51.936
Go, go, go, go. Don't...
Don't look at her.

12:51.938 --> 12:53.371
Don't look at her.
That was my mistake.

12:56.976 --> 12:58.510
Stewie, I don't see
Meg anywhere.

12:58.512 --> 12:59.778
Brian, look!

12:59.780 --> 13:03.448
(sobbing)

13:03.450 --> 13:04.716
Oh, my God!

13:04.718 --> 13:05.784
Meg!

13:05.786 --> 13:06.718
What the hell?

13:06.720 --> 13:07.786
Where'd you get that hat?

13:07.788 --> 13:09.354
Uh, a girl
gave it to me.

13:09.356 --> 13:10.688
Well, what did she
look like?

13:10.690 --> 13:12.857
She had a great
personality.

13:12.859 --> 13:13.992
That's her.

13:13.994 --> 13:15.293
Where is she?
Is she here?

13:15.295 --> 13:18.096
No, uh, they took her
just a little while ago.

13:18.098 --> 13:19.497
Every Wednesday night,

13:19.499 --> 13:20.965
they auction
some of the girls off.

13:20.967 --> 13:22.100
Wednesday?

13:22.102 --> 13:23.101
What a weird night

13:23.103 --> 13:25.003
to auction girls off
into slavery.

13:25.005 --> 13:26.371
Well, you know,
on the weekend,

13:26.373 --> 13:27.472
people probably
have plans.

13:27.474 --> 13:28.673
Have plans?

13:28.675 --> 13:30.041
What are you doing
that's more important

13:30.043 --> 13:31.109
than buying somebody?

13:31.111 --> 13:32.143
Look, where is
this place?

13:32.145 --> 13:33.344
Where do they have
the auction?

13:33.346 --> 13:34.345
I don't know,

13:34.347 --> 13:36.147
but there is
a courtesy shuttle

13:36.149 --> 13:37.816
that runs
every 20 minutes.

13:37.818 --> 13:39.217
What?

13:40.953 --> 13:42.453
Aw, damn it.
We just missed it.

13:42.455 --> 13:44.022
What do you wanna do
for 20 minutes?

13:44.024 --> 13:45.089
Well, I don't know
'bout you,

13:45.091 --> 13:45.990
but I'm gonna work out.

13:45.992 --> 13:47.325
That's how you stay in shape.

13:47.327 --> 13:49.093
You just fit it in
when you have free time,

13:49.095 --> 13:50.261
wherever you are,
wherever you can.

13:50.263 --> 13:52.063
There's semen on this floor.

13:56.302 --> 13:57.368
Stewie, look!

13:58.938 --> 14:00.071
We gotta get in there!

14:01.140 --> 14:02.540
Hey, got one more here!

14:02.542 --> 14:04.042
( Southern falsetto):
Oh, where are we?

14:04.044 --> 14:05.176
I'm from Atlanta.

14:05.178 --> 14:07.045
I don't know
where we are!

14:07.047 --> 14:09.447
Hey, you better hurry.
They're starting soon.

14:10.449 --> 14:11.616
You know what's messed up?

14:11.618 --> 14:12.884
This is all for charity.

14:12.886 --> 14:15.053
All the proceeds
are going to Oxfam.

14:24.296 --> 14:26.030
I hope we're not too late.

14:26.032 --> 14:27.031
You should not
be out here.

14:27.033 --> 14:29.033
Bidding is about
to start.
What the hell?

14:29.035 --> 14:31.069
Stewie!

14:33.339 --> 14:35.139
(exotic music playing)

14:35.141 --> 14:39.310
FEMALE AUCTIONEER:
The current bid is $200,000.

14:39.312 --> 14:40.211
Oh, my God.

14:40.213 --> 14:43.014
AUCTIONEER:
Going once, twice...

14:43.016 --> 14:45.183
Sold for $200,000.

14:45.185 --> 14:47.118
Remember:

14:47.120 --> 14:49.988
There is cash back
when you use your Visa Gold.

14:49.990 --> 14:52.624
Our next item appears to be
a late entry.

14:52.626 --> 14:53.992
It is not in the catalog.

14:53.994 --> 14:56.127
BRIAN:
What the hell?

14:56.129 --> 14:57.829
All right, fellas,
bring the lights up a bit,

14:57.831 --> 15:00.331
play the CD I gave you
and let's do this!

15:00.333 --> 15:02.033
("California Gurls"
by Katy Perry playing)

15:02.035 --> 15:04.535
♪ California girls,
we're unforgettable ♪

15:04.537 --> 15:07.138
Ah, that's right.
You like that?

15:07.140 --> 15:09.374
I have $50,000.

Thank you, Brett Ratner.

15:13.179 --> 15:14.846
Do I have $100,000?

15:14.848 --> 15:17.148
Oh, for God's sake.
$500,000.

15:17.150 --> 15:19.717
We have $500,000.

15:19.719 --> 15:21.786
Going once, going twice,

15:21.788 --> 15:23.187
sold...

15:23.189 --> 15:26.024
to the man
who doesn't quite get auctions.

15:26.026 --> 15:27.959
That was so fun.

15:27.961 --> 15:29.260
How do you
be paying?

15:29.262 --> 15:30.962
Oh, I, uh, I don't
have any money.

15:30.964 --> 15:32.263
Can we work it out,

15:32.265 --> 15:34.799
uh, maybe, some...
other way?

15:34.801 --> 15:36.000
Wait a minute.

15:36.002 --> 15:38.202
Something doesn't
smell funny here.

15:38.204 --> 15:39.470
You're not Arab!

15:39.472 --> 15:41.472
You two are coming
with me.

15:41.474 --> 15:43.041
AUCTIONEER:
This next girl is perfect

15:43.043 --> 15:45.176
for those of you
who want to buy a sex slave

15:45.178 --> 15:48.112
but don't want to spend
sex-slave money.

15:48.114 --> 15:51.115
Wonder what music
they're gonna use for her?

15:51.117 --> 15:56.220
("Let's Make A Deal"
zonk musical cue playing)

15:58.123 --> 15:59.290
Huh, seems about right.

16:06.865 --> 16:09.133
Damn it. We were so close
to saving Meg.

16:09.135 --> 16:10.802
Hey, where's my sister?

16:10.804 --> 16:14.172
She's probably having
her shish kabobbed as we speak.

16:14.174 --> 16:16.941
I heard that from Samantha
in   <i>Sex and the City 2.</i>

16:16.943 --> 16:18.810
Ah-ba-ba-ba-ba,
I haven't seen it yet.

16:18.812 --> 16:20.311
That doesn't hurt
the story.

16:20.313 --> 16:22.046
And now prepare to...

16:23.048 --> 16:25.149
We have a jail cell.

16:25.151 --> 16:26.117
I always tell them,

16:26.119 --> 16:28.152
"Put the prisoners
in the jail cell,"

16:28.154 --> 16:31.022
but they always say,
"Just chain 'em up to a pipe."

16:31.024 --> 16:32.256
Idiots.

16:33.158 --> 16:34.959
Hey, that was some
good teamwork, Brian.

16:34.961 --> 16:36.494
We were like Lewis and Clark

16:36.496 --> 16:38.696
and the guy who likes
to tip over canoes.

16:38.698 --> 16:40.665
Ugh, these rapids
are treacherous.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.667
We should reach calmer waters
by nightfall.

16:42.669 --> 16:44.202
Uh-oh!
Earthquake!

16:44.204 --> 16:45.269
Hey, come on!

16:45.271 --> 16:46.771
Careful!

16:48.540 --> 16:50.041
Damn it. Why is he
still with us?

16:50.043 --> 16:51.209
I know!

16:51.211 --> 16:52.844
Until now, walking
to the other end

16:52.846 --> 16:55.113
of the United States seemed
like such a good job.

16:57.883 --> 16:59.017
There she is! Hurry!

17:01.353 --> 17:02.553
Stewie, what are you doing?

17:02.555 --> 17:04.522
We'll never catch
a speeding car on foot.

17:04.524 --> 17:06.157
Haven't you ever seen
an action movie?

17:06.159 --> 17:07.625
All we have to do

17:07.627 --> 17:10.561
is cut diagonally
across any nearby field.

17:13.999 --> 17:15.633
(tires screeching)

17:15.635 --> 17:16.534
See?

17:16.536 --> 17:18.903
(tires screeching)

17:25.110 --> 17:27.378
Aw, crap, they're taking her
onto that yacht.

17:27.380 --> 17:29.614
(engine whirring)

17:33.218 --> 17:34.852
All right, we just gotta
catch up to the boat.

17:34.854 --> 17:36.154
Well, how we
gonna do that?

17:36.156 --> 17:39.090
Oh, cool!
They got Car Chase GPS.

17:39.958 --> 17:42.827
FEMALE GPS VOICE:
Back up dangerously
into traffic.

17:42.829 --> 17:45.263
(engine revving)

17:45.265 --> 17:47.532
(tires screeching)

17:47.534 --> 17:52.036
Proceed wrong way
down busy street for 500 meters.

17:52.038 --> 17:53.337
(engine revving)

17:53.339 --> 17:55.473
(horns honking)

17:55.475 --> 17:57.675
(tires screeching)

17:57.677 --> 18:00.445
Say "hang on"
and drive down staircase.

18:00.447 --> 18:02.046
Hang on!

18:02.048 --> 18:04.015
(wheels thumping)

18:06.018 --> 18:07.351
(tires screeching,
horns honking)

18:10.022 --> 18:14.358
Poorly edited shot where driver
is obviously stuntperson.

18:25.537 --> 18:27.805
Leave fart in closed car
like a dick.

18:27.807 --> 18:29.774
BRIAN:
Sorry about that!

18:31.944 --> 18:34.011
All right, they're probably
holding her below deck.

18:34.013 --> 18:35.980
You take the right side.
I'll take the left.

18:35.982 --> 18:37.315
You're gonna need this.

18:37.317 --> 18:39.217
What? I-I-I've never
killed anybody before.

18:39.219 --> 18:40.451
Relax, they're Arabs.

18:40.453 --> 18:43.154
People will still be rooting
for you.

18:43.156 --> 18:44.055
Hey!

18:45.124 --> 18:47.859
Son of a bitch.

18:49.695 --> 18:51.996
Oh. This is like
a video game.

18:54.700 --> 18:56.701
Ah, I'm kinda good at this.

18:59.004 --> 19:01.072
Later, dink.

19:05.777 --> 19:07.078
(gun clicking)

19:10.816 --> 19:12.016
(growling)

19:20.292 --> 19:22.193
(gunshot)

19:24.329 --> 19:26.197
That's for shooting
one of our guys!

19:26.199 --> 19:27.298
(cheering)

19:27.300 --> 19:28.699
We got you!
In your face!

19:28.701 --> 19:30.101
Our boat!
Our boat!

19:30.103 --> 19:31.435
This boat!

19:34.006 --> 19:35.873
Let me go,
you fat bastard!

19:35.875 --> 19:37.875
I will never be
your sex slave!

19:37.877 --> 19:39.310
You misunderstand.

19:39.312 --> 19:41.546
I did not buy you
to be my slave.

19:41.548 --> 19:44.549
I bought you for my son,
and not to be his slave,

19:44.551 --> 19:46.817
but to be his wife.

19:46.819 --> 19:47.818
Wife?

19:47.820 --> 19:49.020
Faisal!

19:51.290 --> 19:52.723
This is Faisal,

19:52.725 --> 19:55.092
my son and the heir
to my throne.

19:56.094 --> 19:57.595
My father was correct.

19:57.597 --> 19:59.997
Your beauty
knows no bounds.

19:59.999 --> 20:01.933
Fair goddess,
it is my hope

20:01.935 --> 20:03.668
that you will agree
to be my wife,

20:03.670 --> 20:05.469
but the choice is yours.

20:05.471 --> 20:06.771
If you say "no,"

20:06.773 --> 20:08.372
I will have you flown back
to your family

20:08.374 --> 20:09.941
on our private jet.

20:09.943 --> 20:11.209
But if you say "yes,"

20:11.211 --> 20:13.144
I will spend
the rest of my days

20:13.146 --> 20:15.680
making your every wish
come true.

20:15.682 --> 20:19.016
Will you be my wife,
Princess Meg?

20:19.018 --> 20:21.219
Oh, yes! Yes!

20:25.991 --> 20:27.625
Nooooo!

20:27.627 --> 20:28.926
Stewie?

20:28.928 --> 20:31.529
Hi, Meg.

20:31.531 --> 20:32.930

20:35.969 --> 20:39.136
Oh, honey, we are so glad
to have you back,

20:39.138 --> 20:41.172
but you really don't
remember anything?

20:41.174 --> 20:42.473
Not really, Mom.

20:42.475 --> 20:44.342
I mean, one minute,
I was being proposed to

20:44.344 --> 20:46.010
by a handsome
Arabian prince,

20:46.012 --> 20:47.178
and the next thing
I know,

20:47.180 --> 20:49.180
I'm waking up
in a French hospital.

20:49.182 --> 20:50.948
Oh, and we heard
from Ruth's parents.

20:50.950 --> 20:52.817
She had her tongue ripped out.

20:52.819 --> 20:53.851
(chuckling)

20:53.853 --> 20:55.886
I guess we got off easy, huh?

20:55.888 --> 20:56.954
Well, we put
all your mail

20:56.956 --> 20:58.656
on the desk in your room,
sweetheart.

20:58.658 --> 20:59.790
Thanks, Dad.

20:59.792 --> 21:01.459
I'm kidding.
You didn't get any mail.
