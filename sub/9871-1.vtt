01:38.715 --> 01:41.956
I wrote it all down:
4,222 square feet, four floors. Perfect.

01:42.076 --> 01:44.635
Courtyard in back,
south-facing garden. Perfect.

01:44.796 --> 01:48.076
-Shouldn't we wait for the car service?
-No, we'll sit in traffic forever.

01:48.236 --> 01:50.556
-ls that the listing sheet?
-There isn't one.

01:50.876 --> 01:53.236
I heard about it this morning.
lt'll be gone soon.

01:53.356 --> 01:56.276
-How many more?
-None. You know the market is tight.

01:57.236 --> 02:00.196
-Sarah, do you have to ride that here?
-Mom, we're in the street.

02:01.556 --> 02:02.957
Evan!

02:06.076 --> 02:09.036
One day you will learn
to respect people's time, Lydia.

02:09.276 --> 02:13.477
You'll realize that the world does not stop
and start at your convenience.

02:13.677 --> 02:14.796
l'm so sorry.

02:15.037 --> 02:17.637
l'm meeting Arthur Digby Laurence
in 26 minutes...

02:17.877 --> 02:21.197
...and if you think he's the kind of man
who tolerates tardiness...

02:21.317 --> 02:23.117
...you are sadly mistaken.

02:23.317 --> 02:25.557
You're a saint to wait for us.

02:25.837 --> 02:27.437
-Thank you.
-Hello.

02:29.077 --> 02:33.357
lt's kind of between a townhouse
and a brownstone.

02:34.437 --> 02:35.797
We call it a "townstone."

02:36.077 --> 02:40.437
Built in 1879, this is the middle
of the house, the parlor floor.

02:40.678 --> 02:44.557
Here is the living room.
Formal dining is in the back.

02:44.798 --> 02:47.238
Casual dining below on the kitchen floor...

02:47.478 --> 02:51.198
...which was renovated in '94
with all the expected amenities.

02:51.518 --> 02:52.637
Sarah.

02:53.918 --> 02:56.438
There are two bedroom floors above.

02:58.398 --> 03:00.238
My God, it's amazing.

03:00.318 --> 03:02.518
Hey, kid. No scooter.

03:03.999 --> 03:07.918
l don't have to tell you this amount
of living space is uncommon in Manhattan.

03:10.719 --> 03:13.118
lt's got a yard. Sort of.

03:13.399 --> 03:16.599
lt is in a bit of disarray, but then again,
21-foot lot, 53 deep.

03:16.959 --> 03:19.518
lt allows for an expansive garden.

03:19.879 --> 03:21.599
Working elevator.

03:23.079 --> 03:25.759
The previous owner was disabled
the last years of his life.

03:25.960 --> 03:27.359
Highly unusual, the elevator.

03:27.519 --> 03:29.759
You will not find this
in 90 percent of brownstones.

03:29.879 --> 03:33.920
Perhaps it's something of a fixer-upper,
but we anticipate enormous interest.

03:34.560 --> 03:37.119
lt's a very emotional property.

03:37.399 --> 03:39.599
Shall we have a look at the rest?

03:43.200 --> 03:45.400
You should make an offer immediately.

03:45.640 --> 03:46.840
Can l see it first?

03:47.040 --> 03:50.320
There is nothing like this
on the market right now.

03:50.440 --> 03:52.800
You can't move from Greenwich
to the Upper West Side...

03:52.960 --> 03:56.640
...and expect to still have a house, a yard
and a dog and cat, but here it is.

03:56.760 --> 03:59.281
lt's got everything
you told me you wanted and more.

03:59.561 --> 04:02.441
You'll have another family.
You could have two.

04:02.800 --> 04:03.760
lt's a fortune.

04:03.840 --> 04:06.961
Mom, it's not Barneys.
You don't have to pay the price on the tag.

04:12.801 --> 04:13.840
He can afford it.

04:15.360 --> 04:18.801
lt would be so lovely
if l could show the property before l leave.

04:24.641 --> 04:28.082
Hardwood floors throughout,
as many as six working fireplaces.

04:28.321 --> 04:31.481
This is the top floor. Two bedrooms.
One at either end.

04:31.601 --> 04:33.442
They share one small bath.

04:33.601 --> 04:36.201
Originally, this would have been
the servants' quarters.

04:36.322 --> 04:38.801
The previous owner
kept a small nursing staff.

04:39.042 --> 04:41.161
l don't know if you have live-in help.

04:41.281 --> 04:43.922
No, it's just the two of us.

04:47.882 --> 04:50.442
Third floor, spare bedroom, den,
or what have you.

04:50.722 --> 04:52.923
Mr. Pearlstine used this as an office.

04:53.162 --> 04:56.922
He's talking about Sidney Pearlstine,
the financier.

04:57.682 --> 04:59.643
May l ask what you do, Mrs....

04:59.923 --> 05:01.442
Altman.

05:01.683 --> 05:03.962
Actually, l'm going back to school.
Columbia.

05:04.242 --> 05:07.003
Her husband's in pharmaceuticals.

05:07.202 --> 05:10.683
l didn't realize
you were Stephan Altman's wife.

05:11.403 --> 05:13.443
Yes, until recently.

05:14.243 --> 05:15.803
Master bath.

05:18.763 --> 05:21.123
Pearlstine's been in all the papers
since he died.

05:21.324 --> 05:23.683
His kids are suing each other
over the estate.

05:23.883 --> 05:25.723
He was a recluse. Rich, paranoid.

05:25.803 --> 05:27.884
Now they can't find half his money.

05:28.004 --> 05:30.764
l hardly see how gossip
is germane to showing the property.

05:30.884 --> 05:34.003
Stop calling it "the property."
lt sounds ridiculous.

05:34.923 --> 05:36.283
Walk-in closet.

05:40.164 --> 05:42.244
Could the little one please stop that?

05:42.444 --> 05:44.844
Kid, no elevator!

05:45.284 --> 05:48.564
And we emerge in the master suite.

05:56.685 --> 05:57.884
That's strange.

05:58.045 --> 05:59.084
What?

06:05.325 --> 06:07.325
ls this room smaller than it should be?

06:07.444 --> 06:09.405
You're the first person to notice.

06:09.685 --> 06:14.005
On caravan, no one from our office
had the slightest idea.

06:25.565 --> 06:27.286
lt's called a panic room.

06:27.365 --> 06:29.046
-What?
-A safe room.

06:29.285 --> 06:32.125
-A castle keep in medieval times.
-l've read about these.

06:32.326 --> 06:34.366
They're in vogue in high-end construction.

06:34.686 --> 06:37.006
One can't be too careful
about home invasion.

06:37.126 --> 06:38.406
This is perfect.

06:38.526 --> 06:40.646
The alarm goes off
in the middle of the night.

06:40.766 --> 06:43.606
What will you do?
Call the police and wait till Tuesday?

06:43.726 --> 06:47.206
Traipse downstairs in your underthings
to check it out? l think not.

06:47.327 --> 06:51.206
Concrete walls. Buried phone line,
not connected to the house's main line.

06:51.326 --> 06:54.886
Call the police, nobody can cut you off.
You have your own ventilation system.

06:55.007 --> 06:59.006
A bank of surveillance monitors that covers
nearly every corner of the house.

06:59.527 --> 07:01.206
This whole thing makes me nervous.

07:01.326 --> 07:02.566
Why?

07:02.687 --> 07:04.407
Ever read any Poe?

07:04.567 --> 07:06.647
No, but l loved her last album.

07:08.647 --> 07:10.967
What's to keep somebody
from prying open the door?

07:11.087 --> 07:12.167
Steel.

07:12.327 --> 07:14.767
Thick steel. Very thick steel.

07:14.927 --> 07:17.327
Full battery backup,
so even if the power's out...

07:17.447 --> 07:18.967
...it's still functional.

07:20.287 --> 07:23.767
Oh, my god.
Old Sidney didn't miss a trick, did he?

07:23.887 --> 07:24.927
Open it, please.

07:25.048 --> 07:28.448
And with kids like he's apparently got,
no wonder he wanted a place to hide.

07:28.568 --> 07:29.688
Please open the door.

07:29.808 --> 07:31.288
That is highly inappropriate.

07:31.367 --> 07:33.248
Open the door, please.

07:38.288 --> 07:40.848
My room. Definitely my room.

07:40.968 --> 07:42.488
This is really dangerous.

07:42.808 --> 07:45.848
-That door is a hazard.
-Not at all.

07:49.128 --> 07:51.128
Motion detector, like an elevator.

07:51.208 --> 07:54.688
The door won't close if it's blocked.
There's another one at your ankles.

07:55.209 --> 07:56.849
lt couldn't be safer.

08:11.209 --> 08:13.769
l know they'll take asking price.

08:29.770 --> 08:32.530
lt's working. l hooked up the phone!

08:33.210 --> 08:35.450
Good for you, Mom. Hooked up a phone.

08:35.688 --> 08:37.208
579 what?

08:38.090 --> 08:39.289
3000.

08:44.690 --> 08:46.490
patsy's pizza. pIease hoId.

08:50.810 --> 08:53.611
Hey. Enough.

09:01.210 --> 09:02.971
Mind the pizza?

09:03.211 --> 09:04.411
What do you mean?

09:04.971 --> 09:08.691
Our first night.
l should've thought of something special.

09:08.931 --> 09:10.211
l like pizza.

09:25.612 --> 09:26.772
Fuck him.

09:29.051 --> 09:30.171
Don't.

09:31.772 --> 09:33.332
Fuck her, too.

09:33.892 --> 09:35.212
l agree.

09:36.572 --> 09:37.892
But don't.

09:57.253 --> 09:59.893
Don't you think this place
has way too many stairs?

10:00.052 --> 10:01.733
You didn't carry anything up them.

10:01.852 --> 10:04.213
You never asked
what l thought of this house.

10:04.333 --> 10:06.333
l didn't want you to tell me you hated it.

10:06.453 --> 10:09.613
-l liked our old house.
-Well, so did l.

10:10.533 --> 10:11.974
You know what l was thinking?

10:12.093 --> 10:15.573
l was thinking we could
stencil the whole bookcase.

10:15.814 --> 10:18.414
We could cut the stencils, do it ourselves.

10:19.253 --> 10:20.334
Go ahead.

10:25.534 --> 10:27.534
Oh, damn.

10:28.014 --> 10:30.694
l forgot to set up that tour
of your new school.

10:30.934 --> 10:34.014
Dad already did it.
l'm going with him on Sunday.

10:34.574 --> 10:35.454
Oh, yeah?

10:35.854 --> 10:37.894
So l'll take a cab and meet him there.

10:40.654 --> 10:41.894
ls that what he said?

10:42.574 --> 10:44.694
lsn't that what's so great
about Manhattan?

10:44.974 --> 10:46.815
You don't have to drive me everywhere?

10:47.735 --> 10:49.214
l'll ride with you.

10:49.774 --> 10:52.415
Why'd you bring me here
if l can't go anywhere on my own?

10:52.535 --> 10:54.015
That's it. l quit.

10:55.535 --> 10:57.775
l'm not fighting with you till tomorrow.

10:58.855 --> 10:59.734
Come here.

11:01.335 --> 11:03.255
lt's disgusting how much l love you.

11:03.495 --> 11:04.935
Tell me about it.

11:11.216 --> 11:13.095
-Mom?
-Yeah.

11:14.216 --> 11:15.495
lt's too dark.

11:31.016 --> 11:32.096
Better?

11:32.696 --> 11:33.976
That's better.

13:56.101 --> 13:58.701
"Bypass non-ready zone."

14:03.782 --> 14:06.181
"Bypass non-ready zone."

14:06.341 --> 14:08.901
"Shunt. Enter."

14:18.822 --> 14:21.422
"Bypass non-ready zone."

14:21.702 --> 14:23.022
"Shunt."

14:23.342 --> 14:26.022
"Enter zone number."

14:27.702 --> 14:29.382
"Shunt again."

14:34.903 --> 14:38.183
ln the morning l got to figure out
how to turn this thing off.

15:50.945 --> 15:52.625
Go, go back.

15:56.505 --> 15:57.705
Do it.

19:23.992 --> 19:27.432
Come on. Come on. Jesus fucking Christ.

19:27.873 --> 19:29.113
Amateur.

19:35.153 --> 19:36.953
We got a problem! We need to talk!

19:37.033 --> 19:39.553
lt's about time. l'm freezing
my tits off out there.

19:43.873 --> 19:46.153
-Who is that?
-This is Raoul.

19:46.434 --> 19:47.633
Who the fuck is Raoul?

19:47.913 --> 19:50.473
Raoul is okay. Raoul has experience.

19:50.713 --> 19:52.833
-Where'd you get him?
-Through some people.

19:52.994 --> 19:54.514
Open the fucking door.

19:58.513 --> 19:59.874
No shit.

20:04.674 --> 20:05.714
What is this?

20:05.793 --> 20:09.034
There's a girl on the top floor,
a woman on the third. They're asleep.

20:09.154 --> 20:10.474
They're not supposed to be here.

20:10.594 --> 20:13.674
-This is your department, Junior!
-They are not supposed to be here!

20:13.794 --> 20:15.634
Videotape. We're on videotape.

20:16.274 --> 20:19.554
We've been on videotape since we got here
and the tapes are upstairs.

20:19.674 --> 20:21.115
-14-day escrow.
-You fucked me!

20:21.234 --> 20:25.075
14-day escrow! That's almost 3 weeks!
They should not be in for another week!

20:26.875 --> 20:29.595
Exactly how is 14 days three weeks?

20:29.674 --> 20:32.315
Business days.
Escrow is always business days.

20:32.435 --> 20:34.075
Five-day weeks always!

20:38.355 --> 20:39.555
Right?

20:40.675 --> 20:41.875
l'm out of here.

20:42.755 --> 20:44.755
Just wait a minute. Wait a minute!

20:44.995 --> 20:47.955
We can handle this.
Can we still handle this?

20:48.715 --> 20:50.196
lt's just a woman and a kid?

20:50.275 --> 20:52.435
-Unless Daddy comes home.
-He's not.

20:52.516 --> 20:56.275
They're divorcing. Daddy's banging some
B model on the Upper East Side.

20:56.555 --> 20:58.075
lt's just her and the kid!

20:58.556 --> 21:00.036
Now, can we do this?

21:01.956 --> 21:03.115
Yeah, we can do it.

21:03.555 --> 21:06.076
Not with people here. And not with me.

21:10.876 --> 21:13.236
-Wait! Twenty minutes!
-She'll call the police.

21:13.356 --> 21:15.196
They'll be here before l unpack my bags.

21:15.276 --> 21:18.197
So, we keep an eye on her.

21:18.756 --> 21:21.757
Raoul can totally administrate that part.

21:22.037 --> 21:25.717
l don't want Raoul to administrate that!
He's not even supposed to be here!

21:28.516 --> 21:30.357
Nobody gets hurt.

21:30.917 --> 21:34.037
What about us? What if she has a gun?

21:37.077 --> 21:38.197
Who are you?

21:39.077 --> 21:40.757
l'm Raoul.

21:54.678 --> 21:56.598
You know we can't do this without you!

21:56.838 --> 21:58.397
This is still a good plan.

21:58.598 --> 22:02.558
Fuck that! This is a great plan.
lt's just got a slight twist.

22:02.718 --> 22:03.918
Yeah.

22:04.198 --> 22:06.038
Felony kidnapping. Thirty years.

22:06.238 --> 22:10.758
You make a lot of promises, don't you?
You promise me, you promise your kids.

22:11.758 --> 22:12.758
No family.

22:13.918 --> 22:17.398
You're right. lt's all fucked up.
l fucked it up!

22:17.638 --> 22:19.479
lt's not how it's supposed to be.

22:23.159 --> 22:27.679
But the fact of the matter is
there's still $3,000,000 in this house...

22:27.799 --> 22:31.759
...and no one but you and l
even knows it's here.

22:33.439 --> 22:35.759
Hey, l want that money. l want it!

22:36.159 --> 22:37.439
But you...

22:38.879 --> 22:40.719
...you need that money.

22:41.600 --> 22:44.600
Or have you forgotten why you're here?

22:47.799 --> 22:51.479
So let's quit dicking around, okay,
and get this over with.

22:57.560 --> 22:59.319
Kill the phones.

25:33.165 --> 25:36.005
Top floor, little girl. l've got the mother.
Give me that!

25:36.685 --> 25:39.606
You stay here! Nobody gets past!

25:50.126 --> 25:51.325
Wake up! Sarah!

25:53.006 --> 25:53.886
Get up!

25:59.846 --> 26:01.446
What did you do that for?

26:08.646 --> 26:10.406
Where are you going?

26:19.887 --> 26:22.487
-What's going on?
-People. ln the house.

26:24.646 --> 26:27.207
They're in the elevator, heading down.

26:44.368 --> 26:46.727
Fuck! They're coming down to you!

26:46.887 --> 26:49.207
l told you. l don't hurt people.

26:51.968 --> 26:53.408
They're going downstairs.

26:55.808 --> 26:56.928
-That room.
-What?

26:57.008 --> 26:58.448
The panic room.

26:59.248 --> 27:01.008
No, press emergency stop.

27:05.369 --> 27:06.449
Fuck!

27:09.849 --> 27:11.249
Coming back up!

27:22.449 --> 27:23.329
That's you.

27:26.609 --> 27:27.489
Shit.

27:35.530 --> 27:36.649
Go!

27:38.010 --> 27:38.849
Fuck!

27:38.970 --> 27:42.370
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

27:43.809 --> 27:45.250
Damn it! Mother--

27:47.890 --> 27:49.050
Shit!

28:00.130 --> 28:01.810
That's seven years bad luck.

28:03.810 --> 28:04.970
Shit.

28:19.170 --> 28:20.931
Tell me they're not in there.

28:39.972 --> 28:41.212
Oh, damn.

28:42.091 --> 28:44.732
-lt doesn't work?
-lt's a different phone line.

28:46.132 --> 28:47.571
l never hooked it up.

28:52.372 --> 28:53.492
Now what?

29:19.252 --> 29:20.773
l can't hear a thing.

29:21.653 --> 29:23.373
What do you think they want?

29:23.573 --> 29:25.253
l don't know. Rob us....

29:28.014 --> 29:29.374
l don't know.

29:29.613 --> 29:30.973
What do we do?

29:31.694 --> 29:33.054
We wait.

29:33.653 --> 29:35.893
-What if they get in here?
-Well, they can't.

29:37.653 --> 29:39.614
They can't get in. lt's not possible.

29:39.733 --> 29:41.254
Mom. l heard you.

29:45.014 --> 29:47.134
-Do you feel okay?
-Yeah.

29:47.254 --> 29:48.614
-You shaky?
-No.

29:48.694 --> 29:50.094
-Chills?
-No.

29:53.054 --> 29:55.654
Please. Don't worry about me.

30:12.614 --> 30:14.775
He's got kids. What do you think he'll do?

30:14.895 --> 30:17.575
Hang out while the cops waltz in?
Use your head.

30:17.815 --> 30:18.935
Here he comes.

30:19.055 --> 30:21.895
l locked the roof access.
She's not getting down from there.

30:22.015 --> 30:24.815
-Good.
-She could be in there calling the cops.

30:24.936 --> 30:27.015
Could she have hooked it up today?

30:27.095 --> 30:29.135
No. You don't just call up Bell Atlantic.

30:29.255 --> 30:32.216
She would've had to do it through
Manhattan Security, my company.

30:32.375 --> 30:34.855
l checked the paperwork
and the phone is not connected.

30:34.975 --> 30:36.895
You see? She couldn't have.

30:37.656 --> 30:40.776
-l thought she wouldn't be here.
-He said she wouldn't.

30:40.856 --> 30:43.656
Fuck you! And fuck you!
She is not supposed--

30:49.016 --> 30:50.096
Do it.

30:53.057 --> 30:54.536
Excuse me.

30:56.576 --> 30:58.696
The poIice are on their way.

31:07.896 --> 31:09.937
-She's lying.
-You're full of--

31:13.537 --> 31:15.897
lt's not an intercom. lt's a PA system.

31:16.017 --> 31:18.577
l know. l'm just scaring her.

31:18.817 --> 31:21.017
I suggest you Ieave before they get here.

31:25.897 --> 31:28.377
-What?
-He's saying that we don't have a phone.

31:28.497 --> 31:29.857
How could he know that?

31:31.418 --> 31:33.417
Take what you want and get outI

31:34.458 --> 31:36.338
lf only it were that easy.

31:38.617 --> 31:41.458
Some paper. l need some paper.
Give me some paper.

31:41.578 --> 31:43.498
Hey, Zorro! You going to help us out?

31:43.618 --> 31:45.057
You got a piece of paper?

31:49.178 --> 31:51.658
-What is he doing?
-l don't know.

32:03.419 --> 32:05.619
"What we want is in that room"?

32:05.859 --> 32:07.779
They're coming in here, aren't they?

32:07.899 --> 32:10.298
No, no. l told you. They can't get in here.

32:11.819 --> 32:13.579
What do you know about this room?

32:13.699 --> 32:15.339
What do we know about that room?

32:15.459 --> 32:17.739
-Let's not tell her anything.
-Just a few details.

32:32.699 --> 32:35.419
We're not coming out,
and we're not letting you in!

32:35.580 --> 32:37.380
Get out of my houseI

32:37.860 --> 32:39.659
-Say "fuck."
-You fuck.

32:43.380 --> 32:44.420
-Mom.
-What?

32:44.540 --> 32:46.380
"Get the fuck out of my house."

32:46.700 --> 32:48.540
Get the fuck out of my houseI

32:54.701 --> 32:56.221
Okay, l have an idea.

32:56.660 --> 32:59.020
She's a woman. Women need security.

33:03.380 --> 33:04.821
She won't believe you.

33:05.101 --> 33:09.661
She needs to know she's dealing
with decent people and she can trust us.

33:16.542 --> 33:18.061
Conversation's overI

33:21.661 --> 33:23.421
What? She's not coming down?

33:23.621 --> 33:26.861
Shut up.
Will you please shut up and let me think?

33:27.502 --> 33:29.022
Like that'll help you think.

33:29.142 --> 33:31.381
You know what? Fine! You think!

33:31.501 --> 33:33.542
-What if she did call the cops?
-She didn't.

33:33.662 --> 33:35.662
She said it again, that she called the cops.

33:35.782 --> 33:38.142
lf cops were coming,
do you think l'd still be here?

33:38.262 --> 33:40.902
Okay, fine. Good, excellent.
We all believe you.

33:41.462 --> 33:43.182
How do we get into that room?

33:49.463 --> 33:51.223
What is funny about this?

33:52.063 --> 33:53.862
ls this shit funny to you?

33:54.342 --> 33:57.143
l spent the last 12 years
building these rooms...

33:57.422 --> 33:59.382
...to keep out people like us.

33:59.502 --> 34:04.143
lt's all so ironic and amusing, okay?
Now, how do we get in?

34:05.703 --> 34:06.863
We can't.

34:07.863 --> 34:09.503
You can't get in the panic room.

34:09.623 --> 34:13.103
That's the whole point.
We have to get her to come out.

34:13.663 --> 34:15.303
And why would she do that?

34:16.143 --> 34:17.382
l don't know.

34:18.264 --> 34:21.424
But when she does,
she can't get out of this house.

34:22.463 --> 34:25.623
We keep her here,
we keep her quiet for 20 minutes...

34:25.862 --> 34:28.743
...and l don't want any help
from Joe Pesci over here.

34:29.464 --> 34:31.984
They want to hole up in this house? Fine.

34:32.263 --> 34:34.463
We make it impossible for them to leave.

34:37.184 --> 34:39.824
And why would they come out
in the first place?

34:42.024 --> 34:43.704
l'm working on that.

34:51.543 --> 34:53.664
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

34:56.625 --> 34:57.985
Small space?

34:58.665 --> 34:59.905
l'm okay.

35:01.425 --> 35:02.825
-You can't wig out.
-l know.

35:02.945 --> 35:04.585
-l mean it.
-l won't.

35:07.345 --> 35:10.305
You know,
people never get buried alive anymore.

35:11.985 --> 35:14.226
l guess it used to happen all the time.

35:15.186 --> 35:16.426
Really?

35:16.665 --> 35:18.025
Yeah, l read that.

35:19.185 --> 35:21.425
And when did this happen all the time?

35:23.826 --> 35:25.826
Twenty, thirty years ago.

35:28.826 --> 35:30.585
What are they doing now?

35:36.786 --> 35:38.306
l don't know.

36:36.508 --> 36:38.068
They're locking us in.

37:15.750 --> 37:17.510
This is not happening.

37:27.709 --> 37:29.070
Sarah, calm down.

37:31.190 --> 37:34.350
You know what could happen
if you let yourself get worked up.

37:35.511 --> 37:36.710
Sarah!

38:05.272 --> 38:08.351
-What the hell are you doing?
-We're coming in from below.

38:08.591 --> 38:11.832
No, you're not. Even if you got through
the concrete, there's steel.

38:11.911 --> 38:13.591
You won't even make a dent.

38:14.432 --> 38:15.672
We'll see.

38:16.991 --> 38:19.031
Hey. This is what l do.

38:19.311 --> 38:22.031
lf some idiot with a sledgehammer
could break in...

38:22.311 --> 38:25.112
...do you really think
that l would still have a job?

38:33.712 --> 38:35.432
Don't get that in your eye.

39:08.433 --> 39:09.594
Neighbor.

39:09.833 --> 39:10.993
Help!

39:11.153 --> 39:13.314
Please help us!

39:13.873 --> 39:15.793
-Call the police!
-Do you hear us?

39:16.233 --> 39:17.234
Help us!

39:28.434 --> 39:29.594
Help!

39:29.834 --> 39:32.634
-Help us, please!
-Call the police!

40:14.795 --> 40:16.076
Shit!

40:42.157 --> 40:44.156
You guys just going to stand there?

40:44.676 --> 40:46.837
Why? What do you got, MacGyver?

41:20.318 --> 41:22.758
He can't get in here with a hammer,
can he?

41:28.959 --> 41:31.078
Could you be any louder?

41:41.039 --> 41:42.919
Give me a hand with those boxes.

41:45.079 --> 41:46.439
Listen, goddamn it!

41:46.839 --> 41:49.959
l'm in charge here.
Now, what the hell is going on?

41:55.639 --> 41:58.880
-They're going to get in here.
-No, they can't get in here.

42:02.359 --> 42:05.000
We're going to be fine. We'll be just fine.

43:08.601 --> 43:09.922
Oh, this is good.

43:11.642 --> 43:12.961
This could work.

43:13.202 --> 43:16.282
l was just thinking
that we should do something like this.

43:20.282 --> 43:23.042
-Open it.
-l just did.

43:23.162 --> 43:24.922
Open it some more.

43:26.602 --> 43:28.762
We're just sending them a message.

43:29.923 --> 43:31.402
They'll get the point.

44:07.724 --> 44:09.444
Honey, get down on the ground.

44:17.764 --> 44:20.964
Quit dicking around
and open this fucking thing up.

44:21.044 --> 44:23.084
-Don't be stupid.
-Quiet!

44:23.204 --> 44:25.684
We're trying to scare them, not kill them.

44:32.485 --> 44:33.845
What is it?

44:34.564 --> 44:35.524
lt's bad.

44:37.604 --> 44:39.005
They're coughing.

44:39.365 --> 44:41.525
lf they're coughing, they're going to die!

44:41.645 --> 44:43.205
Nobody is going to die, man!

44:43.285 --> 44:46.485
Will you please have the balls
to follow through with something?

45:01.166 --> 45:02.285
Mom.

45:06.525 --> 45:09.926
The worst that'll happen is they'll pass out.
They'll have a hangover.

45:10.006 --> 45:13.086
How are we going to get in there
if they pass out, Junior?

45:15.606 --> 45:16.807
Cut it back a little.

45:16.886 --> 45:19.766
They won't pass out, numb-nuts.
They'll throw up first.

45:19.926 --> 45:21.846
We can't get in if they're dead!

45:24.366 --> 45:26.206
Stay on the ground and breathe.

45:32.766 --> 45:34.167
Turn it down.

45:34.887 --> 45:36.287
Turn it down! lt's too much!

45:36.446 --> 45:38.847
-Don't you start up with this shit.
-Keep it down!

45:49.527 --> 45:50.727
l'm turning it down.

45:50.808 --> 45:53.207
-Keep his ass off of me.
-We're not killing anybody.

46:04.088 --> 46:06.248
-Tell him to turn it down!
-Turn the shit off.

46:06.848 --> 46:08.488
-No.
-Turn it down.

46:19.769 --> 46:21.648
-Mom?
-Just a second.

46:26.008 --> 46:27.169
Get under this.

46:28.848 --> 46:29.889
Oh, my god.

46:30.129 --> 46:32.688
-Fucking amateurs, man!
-lt's my fucking idea.

46:42.369 --> 46:45.649
Shut the fuck up!
There are people trying to sleep over there.

47:09.250 --> 47:10.490
What is that?

47:12.010 --> 47:13.370
Turn the gas off.

47:22.171 --> 47:23.970
Turn the gas off right now.

47:46.651 --> 47:47.932
Get back!

47:48.531 --> 47:49.651
Shit!

47:52.452 --> 47:53.731
God!

47:53.852 --> 47:55.092
Get it off me!

48:01.252 --> 48:02.412
lt's okay.

48:04.972 --> 48:09.452
You fucking bitch! You fucking bitch!
l'm coming in there!

48:10.492 --> 48:12.492
Calm the fuck down.

48:22.292 --> 48:24.133
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

48:25.653 --> 48:29.933
Promise me you'll never do
anything like that.

48:30.893 --> 48:32.053
l won't.

48:34.853 --> 48:38.174
They're moving.
At least they're still moving in there.

48:50.054 --> 48:51.054
What?

48:51.734 --> 48:52.974
Talk to him.

48:55.934 --> 48:58.213
Please, man, give it a rest.

49:56.936 --> 49:59.056
-That Morse code?
-SOS.

49:59.296 --> 50:00.816
Where'd you learn that?

50:01.056 --> 50:02.296
Titanic.

50:13.217 --> 50:15.216
We got to talk. Downstairs.

50:21.096 --> 50:23.377
No, no, no. Not you.

50:29.617 --> 50:32.937
Come on, come on, come on.

50:34.217 --> 50:35.417
Get up.

50:36.538 --> 50:37.778
Come on.

50:46.577 --> 50:47.857
Wake up.

50:53.098 --> 50:56.818
The first thing l'm going to do this morning
is call my plastic surgeon.

50:56.898 --> 51:01.698
There's been a change here.
$100,000 is not enough. Not for this shit.

51:02.938 --> 51:05.738
l want a third
of whatever's in that room up there.

51:09.778 --> 51:10.699
Fine!

51:10.819 --> 51:14.939
Okay? Full share, one-third.
Congratulations.

51:15.538 --> 51:19.539
You bought a ski mask, made $1,000,000.
Your parents will be proud.

51:41.019 --> 51:42.220
Got him.

51:42.699 --> 51:46.500
Let me straighten out something else.
Get control of your goddamn expert.

51:46.740 --> 51:48.979
l'm not losing
my half of the money because--

51:49.100 --> 51:50.499
Slow down. Half?

51:50.619 --> 51:53.900
Did you sleep through grade school?
Five seconds ago, it was a third....

51:54.820 --> 51:56.020
Come on.

52:00.940 --> 52:03.060
l'm letting you know he's a problem.

52:03.300 --> 52:05.940
But this wasn't my idea,
so he's your problem.

52:06.101 --> 52:08.260
You're right. lt wasn't your idea!

52:08.380 --> 52:10.420
None of this was your idea!
lt was my idea!

52:13.781 --> 52:15.460
Come on, look over here.

52:27.501 --> 52:28.541
Yes.

52:29.381 --> 52:30.621
Yes, yes, yes.

52:34.101 --> 52:36.341
Let's hope this guy's an ex-Boy Scout.

52:42.341 --> 52:44.021
-We're here!
-Help us!

52:44.102 --> 52:45.822
We're over here!

52:55.902 --> 52:57.062
Help!

52:57.222 --> 52:59.262
Open your window!

52:59.422 --> 53:00.622
Help!

53:08.822 --> 53:11.022
We're never going to get out of here.

53:19.143 --> 53:22.263
l'm the loving grandson who put in
the time with the old man...

53:22.383 --> 53:24.663
...every goddamn weekend for two years...

53:24.863 --> 53:27.743
...talking to him, dressing him,
walking him, feeding him.

53:27.903 --> 53:29.263
Are you done?

53:29.383 --> 53:32.504
No. l'm the one the old man
finally told about the safe.

53:32.623 --> 53:36.303
l'm the one who found the guy who built it,
and l convinced him to break into it!

53:39.863 --> 53:41.063
Wait a minute.

53:44.063 --> 53:47.184
-What?
-The bedroom's empty. Where are they?

53:49.304 --> 53:50.984
Two of them, on the stairs.

53:51.743 --> 53:53.224
Where's the third guy?

53:57.104 --> 53:59.024
l left my cell phone by the bed.

54:03.385 --> 54:04.784
l earned that money.

54:05.145 --> 54:07.465
l will not let you jeopardize
my fucking plan...

54:07.625 --> 54:10.745
...because you have a problem
relating to others!

54:12.265 --> 54:13.465
Got it?

54:14.784 --> 54:16.825
lf l don't come back, close this door.

54:16.905 --> 54:18.624
Just do what l say.

54:20.865 --> 54:22.705
He touches me again, l'll shoot him.

54:22.785 --> 54:23.785
Christ!

54:26.185 --> 54:27.305
Wait!

54:30.666 --> 54:33.865
Any other schoolyard bullshit to settle,
or can we get back to work?

54:34.346 --> 54:36.185
Don't take no tone with me, jerk-wad.

54:36.385 --> 54:39.105
l'll shove it up your ass and snap it off.

54:39.225 --> 54:42.466
You're a bus driver, Raoul.

54:42.905 --> 54:44.186
You live in Flatbush.

54:44.305 --> 54:47.025
Don't spout some Elmore Leonard
bullshit you just heard...

54:47.305 --> 54:48.986
...because l saw that movie, too.

54:49.426 --> 54:50.346
What is this?

54:52.546 --> 54:53.906
l got some news for you.

54:56.106 --> 54:57.427
Go.

54:57.666 --> 54:59.026
Go!

56:43.470 --> 56:44.350
Fuck!

56:46.350 --> 56:48.830
She got something. What did she get?

56:49.950 --> 56:50.830
No.

56:52.910 --> 56:54.031
Charger!

56:54.750 --> 56:56.790
She has a cell phone.

56:58.271 --> 56:59.191
No!

57:01.070 --> 57:02.351
All right, signal.

57:02.590 --> 57:05.150
Come on. Signal.

57:16.271 --> 57:19.511
l don't think they'll be talking
on no cell phone from in there.

57:20.551 --> 57:23.071
-Why not?
-You can't call out from in there.

57:25.911 --> 57:27.352
No signal.

57:36.591 --> 57:39.232
l didn't hook up this line,
but l hooked up the main line.

57:39.352 --> 57:41.752
lf we can find it, we can cut into it.

57:43.672 --> 57:48.272
l can't go to prison, man.
l'm not built for that shit.

57:59.112 --> 58:00.072
Be careful.

58:11.153 --> 58:12.353
Get the phone.

58:12.553 --> 58:14.553
-lt doesn't come off.
-Rip it off!

58:25.634 --> 58:27.714
Screwdriver. Phillips.

58:34.914 --> 58:38.954
Junior, when l asked you to cut
the phone lines, did you cut the main line?

58:39.314 --> 58:42.394
Or did you just cut the cord on the phone
in the kitchen?

59:07.355 --> 59:08.194
Shit!

59:11.115 --> 59:13.155
Strip this and expose the wires.

59:13.275 --> 59:15.395
-What are we doing?
-l have no idea.

59:42.356 --> 59:44.836
-Okay, got it?
-Yeah. Here.

59:45.077 --> 59:46.116
Okay.

59:46.596 --> 59:48.116
Yellow, yellow.

01:00:01.917 --> 01:00:02.796
Okay.

01:00:05.116 --> 01:00:06.277
Dial tone.

01:00:14.997 --> 01:00:16.198
911 emergency.

01:00:16.437 --> 01:00:18.997
Yes, this is 38 West 94th Street--

01:00:19.117 --> 01:00:22.157
-pIease hoId.
-No, no. God.

01:00:27.598 --> 01:00:28.478
Call Dad.

01:00:33.398 --> 01:00:37.038
How do you live in New York
and not have a single Percocet?

01:00:39.318 --> 01:00:42.318
-HeIIo?
-Stephan. Put Stephan on the line.

01:00:42.438 --> 01:00:44.199
-Who is this?
-lt's Meg.

01:00:45.038 --> 01:00:46.598
Do you know what time it is?

01:00:46.998 --> 01:00:50.118
-Put him on the phone, bitch.
-It's your fucking wife.

01:00:53.958 --> 01:00:54.879
Move.

01:00:56.958 --> 01:00:59.199
-HeIIo?
-You've got to help us.

01:00:59.279 --> 01:01:00.199
Move!

01:01:00.439 --> 01:01:03.559
There are three men upstairs.
They broke in--

01:01:06.839 --> 01:01:07.719
What--

01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:24.119
-He'll do something.
-No, he won't.

01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:25.680
He'll call the police.

01:01:25.919 --> 01:01:27.880
You don't know her. She won't let him.

01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:31.360
No. He knows that there's trouble.
He heard me.

01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:35.360
He's across the park. That's why
we got houses close to each other.

01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:37.800
Just in case we needed each other.
He'll help us.

01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:40.080
-He won't.
-Yes, he will!

01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:47.080
l'm sorry.

01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:49.400
No, l'm sorry.

01:01:50.561 --> 01:01:51.481
Why?

01:01:52.881 --> 01:01:54.720
l was trying not to tell you.

01:01:55.921 --> 01:01:56.841
What?

01:01:57.521 --> 01:01:59.361
l'm dizzy and hungry.

01:02:02.521 --> 01:02:05.601
All she's got is NyQuil and fucking Midol.

01:02:08.002 --> 01:02:10.322
Looks like that gas idea
didn't work so well.

01:02:11.041 --> 01:02:12.361
Whose fault was that?

01:02:12.561 --> 01:02:13.801
This is impossible.

01:02:14.042 --> 01:02:15.601
What's the plan now, hot rod?

01:02:15.721 --> 01:02:18.282
This is worse than impossible.
This is unpleasant.

01:02:20.322 --> 01:02:22.961
Here, drink this.
All right, drink lots of water.

01:02:23.642 --> 01:02:26.882
You dropped to the low 40s.
We have to get your blood-sugar up.

01:02:26.961 --> 01:02:28.402
Can you hear me okay?

01:02:28.522 --> 01:02:30.202
l'm just dizzy, not deaf.

01:02:31.162 --> 01:02:33.242
Great. Smart ass. That's excellent.

01:02:33.362 --> 01:02:37.442
Did you see anything in here?
Any candy bars or something sweet?

01:02:38.043 --> 01:02:39.162
Let's check it again.

01:02:39.283 --> 01:02:40.602
Mom, l did it.

01:02:40.962 --> 01:02:42.762
We got to stay calm, okay?

01:02:42.843 --> 01:02:45.922
lf we stay calm, everything will be fine.
All right? Stay calm.

01:02:46.003 --> 01:02:47.483
You're making me nervous.

01:02:47.763 --> 01:02:49.283
l'm sorry.

01:02:50.923 --> 01:02:52.322
What if l keep dropping?

01:02:53.643 --> 01:02:56.283
You won't. l'll figure something out.

01:02:58.923 --> 01:03:00.403
You know, he's right.

01:03:01.323 --> 01:03:03.483
There's no way
we're getting into that room.

01:03:03.603 --> 01:03:05.083
What are you talking about?

01:03:06.483 --> 01:03:09.164
l just got to be honest with myself here.

01:03:09.844 --> 01:03:11.484
l don't need to be involved...

01:03:11.603 --> 01:03:15.243
...with anything so harrowing
or perilous at this point in my life.

01:03:15.324 --> 01:03:18.084
-You're giving up?
-Hell, yes.

01:03:18.324 --> 01:03:21.804
l don't need the fucking aggravation.
l'll make an anonymous phone call.

01:03:21.924 --> 01:03:25.884
They'll find the floor safe. l'll inherit.

01:03:26.924 --> 01:03:28.684
Stephen, Jeffrey, Catherine, David.

01:03:28.924 --> 01:03:32.164
Five grandkids, 60 percent inheritance tax.

01:03:32.324 --> 01:03:36.284
Fuck, l'll still put away 8 or 900 grand
and keep my goddamn hair.

01:03:37.244 --> 01:03:40.045
Take it. Go out and get loaded.

01:03:40.884 --> 01:03:42.605
Wait a minute.

01:03:43.605 --> 01:03:45.645
Say what you just said again.

01:03:51.324 --> 01:03:53.965
Say that shit about the money
again, babycakes.

01:03:54.965 --> 01:03:58.365
When? Before?

01:03:58.685 --> 01:03:59.925
Yeah, before.

01:04:00.045 --> 01:04:03.565
Splitting the money in your head,
you said you'd put away 800 or 900 grand.

01:04:04.965 --> 01:04:06.485
What are you doing?

01:04:06.605 --> 01:04:10.405
That was after tax, which makes it more
than a million and a half gross.

01:04:11.686 --> 01:04:14.006
So now you're a tax attorney.

01:04:16.685 --> 01:04:19.686
-l'm out of here.
-Wait a minute.

01:04:20.005 --> 01:04:24.206
There's sugar in everything.
Places you'd never expect. Like ketchup.

01:04:24.446 --> 01:04:25.806
Where else?

01:04:28.566 --> 01:04:30.206
Travel kit.

01:04:30.326 --> 01:04:32.966
Plus, you named eight people
you got to split it with...

01:04:33.046 --> 01:04:35.486
...so that's 10 or 12 million bucks
in the safe.

01:04:35.686 --> 01:04:38.686
A fuck-up like you has got to get less
than everybody else...

01:04:38.806 --> 01:04:40.686
...so now l don't know what to think.

01:04:41.126 --> 01:04:43.527
You're adding up money
you'll never touch, buddy.

01:04:44.607 --> 01:04:46.446
How much is in there?

01:04:48.567 --> 01:04:49.927
Mouthwash.

01:04:50.807 --> 01:04:51.687
Saccharin.

01:04:54.567 --> 01:04:57.047
Hey, l'm talking to you. Answer me.

01:04:57.527 --> 01:04:58.847
Fine. There's more.

01:04:59.647 --> 01:05:02.527
And when were you going to tell us
this minor economic detail?

01:05:02.647 --> 01:05:04.928
lt doesn't matter now.
lt's totally fucking moot!

01:05:05.807 --> 01:05:08.727
-Why are we having this conversation?
-What were you thinking?

01:05:08.847 --> 01:05:11.167
How did you expect to get away with this?

01:05:11.287 --> 01:05:13.288
Did you think that l'd open that safe...

01:05:13.408 --> 01:05:16.568
...and then me and Raoul would wait
while you picked out your share?

01:05:17.488 --> 01:05:19.247
What's the matter with you?

01:05:19.328 --> 01:05:22.247
You got us into this mess,
and you were going to fuck us?

01:05:22.328 --> 01:05:25.768
You got yourself into this.
You got the custody lawyers up your ass.

01:05:25.928 --> 01:05:28.528
Your eyes were huge
when l told you about the gig...

01:05:28.608 --> 01:05:29.968
...so don't play innocent.

01:05:30.568 --> 01:05:32.448
Things didn't work out.

01:05:33.848 --> 01:05:35.369
Play past it.

01:05:40.169 --> 01:05:42.288
Mints? Sugar-free.

01:05:42.329 --> 01:05:43.008
Mints? Sugar-free.

01:05:43.128 --> 01:05:46.489
l'm opening that safe.
You leave, you get nothing.

01:05:46.649 --> 01:05:48.409
lt's looking doubtful there, big guy.

01:05:48.529 --> 01:05:52.169
l will split the money with Raoul.
But l don't ever want to see you again.

01:05:52.288 --> 01:05:55.849
Cops show up on my doorstep,
we will know who sent them...

01:05:56.089 --> 01:05:58.089
...and we will fucking find you.

01:06:02.410 --> 01:06:03.729
l'll see you, Burnham.

01:06:04.969 --> 01:06:06.130
Later, Raoul.

01:06:12.130 --> 01:06:13.289
Mom!

01:06:21.690 --> 01:06:24.850
Ride in a Town Car to 125th Street
a couple of times...

01:06:24.970 --> 01:06:27.050
...think you know all about it.

01:06:29.730 --> 01:06:31.891
You don't know nothing about me.

01:06:33.131 --> 01:06:35.770
Sarah, listen to me:

01:06:36.131 --> 01:06:38.731
Go to the corner. Shut your eyes
and don't turn around.

01:06:38.810 --> 01:06:39.851
Okay.

01:06:44.371 --> 01:06:46.610
You should see the look on your face.

01:06:48.051 --> 01:06:49.171
What's happening?

01:06:49.691 --> 01:06:52.611
-Don't move. Don't you fucking move.
-No, don't.

01:06:52.811 --> 01:06:54.011
Come here.

01:06:54.251 --> 01:06:55.411
Come here.

01:06:55.731 --> 01:06:58.291
-Don't shoot, please.
-Come on.

01:06:58.372 --> 01:07:02.612
Shut it, lock it
and get the fuck away from it.

01:07:08.571 --> 01:07:10.932
-Stop it, you fucking--
-Fucking what?

01:07:11.372 --> 01:07:14.451
Clown? ldiot? Fucking asshole?

01:07:15.932 --> 01:07:17.652
Who's the clown now?

01:07:17.932 --> 01:07:18.732
Me.

01:07:19.012 --> 01:07:20.212
That's right.

01:07:20.732 --> 01:07:22.412
lt's burning me.

01:07:22.652 --> 01:07:23.852
Who's got the gun?

01:07:24.652 --> 01:07:25.532
You.

01:07:26.692 --> 01:07:27.692
Remember that.

01:07:28.932 --> 01:07:30.772
Find out who the fuck that is.

01:07:34.652 --> 01:07:35.852
Give me your wallet.

01:07:37.092 --> 01:07:38.492
Give me your wallet.

01:07:43.132 --> 01:07:44.693
Stephan Altman.

01:07:51.093 --> 01:07:53.773
Did your wife give you a call, Stephan?

01:07:56.373 --> 01:07:57.774
What did she say?

01:08:00.693 --> 01:08:02.613
Don't know. Cut off.

01:08:02.814 --> 01:08:05.333
-Phones are dead.
-Did you call anybody else?

01:08:07.614 --> 01:08:10.454
Did you call the fucking cops, Stephan?

01:08:13.973 --> 01:08:14.774
No.

01:08:15.334 --> 01:08:16.934
He's telling the truth.

01:08:18.413 --> 01:08:19.134
Yeah.

01:08:19.734 --> 01:08:20.934
Yeah, he probably is.

01:08:21.573 --> 01:08:23.894
Because when l do this, people don't lie.

01:08:24.493 --> 01:08:25.254
What?

01:08:26.374 --> 01:08:28.654
-What do you want?
-Get us into that room.

01:08:28.814 --> 01:08:30.135
-l can't.
-Yeah, you can.

01:08:30.935 --> 01:08:33.975
You're full of ideas.
You just got to squeeze one out.

01:08:34.095 --> 01:08:36.015
You want me to just make something up?

01:08:36.334 --> 01:08:38.175
You've got till the count of three.

01:08:38.654 --> 01:08:40.654
Then you end up like Junior over there.

01:08:43.375 --> 01:08:45.694
-One, squeeze.
-This is ridiculous.

01:08:45.814 --> 01:08:46.854
Two, squeeze.

01:08:46.975 --> 01:08:48.495
l don't know what to tell you.

01:08:48.575 --> 01:08:49.694
-Three.
-Wait!

01:08:50.415 --> 01:08:51.455
Okay.

01:08:54.135 --> 01:08:55.694
l got an idea.

01:09:00.296 --> 01:09:01.136
Maybe.

01:09:02.776 --> 01:09:03.576
Maybe.

01:09:03.935 --> 01:09:07.015

Let It Be, RevoIver, Sgt. pepper....

01:09:19.456 --> 01:09:20.216
Oh, god!

01:09:23.856 --> 01:09:25.456
Dad?

01:09:25.536 --> 01:09:26.696
No, no.

01:09:38.577 --> 01:09:40.017
Take it easy.

01:09:41.017 --> 01:09:43.096
Open the door! Open the door!

01:09:47.737 --> 01:09:48.737
No.

01:09:51.017 --> 01:09:52.977
Don't open the door!

01:09:56.737 --> 01:09:59.457
-Just make it look good.
-Don't you tell me what--

01:10:04.378 --> 01:10:05.898
Open the door!

01:10:06.737 --> 01:10:08.058
Don't open--

01:10:14.218 --> 01:10:15.778
Knock it off!

01:10:15.978 --> 01:10:18.858
You kill him, they'll never open that door.

01:10:28.538 --> 01:10:29.459
Oh, god.

01:10:29.979 --> 01:10:32.658
All right. Lie down. Lie down.

01:10:32.979 --> 01:10:34.099
Lie down.

01:10:35.499 --> 01:10:36.419
All right.

01:10:39.899 --> 01:10:41.739
You'll be fine. Come on.

01:10:42.859 --> 01:10:43.939
He's fucking crazy.

01:10:44.059 --> 01:10:46.779
Get your hands off him,
you frightening hillbilly motherfucker!

01:10:47.739 --> 01:10:48.939
You're a strong girl.

01:10:49.059 --> 01:10:52.299
You be strong. Be strong, sweetheart.

01:10:54.819 --> 01:10:57.580
Get the fuck off him, now!

01:10:57.980 --> 01:10:59.579
lt's almost over.

01:11:04.420 --> 01:11:06.300
Yeah, that's it. That's it.

01:11:26.900 --> 01:11:29.180

You might want to wear it inside out.

01:12:53.983 --> 01:12:55.024
Get your tapes.

01:13:13.144 --> 01:13:14.504
Who's this?

01:13:18.865 --> 01:13:20.105
lt's her kid.

01:13:21.504 --> 01:13:22.904
What happened to her?

01:13:24.424 --> 01:13:26.624
Who gives a fuck?

01:13:53.785 --> 01:13:55.906
Hurry up. Get your stuff.

01:14:28.306 --> 01:14:29.707
Hey, lady.

01:14:33.707 --> 01:14:34.587
Mom?

01:14:39.707 --> 01:14:41.147
What are you doing?

01:14:43.628 --> 01:14:45.347
What are you doing?

01:14:54.988 --> 01:14:56.348
We've got your kid.

01:15:04.628 --> 01:15:05.908

01:15:41.429 --> 01:15:43.349
No! Let her out!

01:15:46.149 --> 01:15:47.790
-Where's your gun?
-Open the door.

01:15:47.909 --> 01:15:49.149

01:15:51.390 --> 01:15:53.030
-Where's your gun?
-l don't know.

01:15:53.150 --> 01:15:54.630

01:16:02.870 --> 01:16:05.470
Shut up! Listen to me.
She's got your gun.

01:16:06.350 --> 01:16:07.990
She's got your gun!

01:16:09.590 --> 01:16:11.950
Stop screaming. Stop it.

01:16:30.271 --> 01:16:31.911

01:16:32.231 --> 01:16:34.711
put the gun down
and step away from the door.

01:16:37.991 --> 01:16:41.312
You got to open the door.
My daughter is very sick.

01:16:41.551 --> 01:16:43.392
She needs an injection.

01:16:44.472 --> 01:16:45.672
Do you hear me?

01:16:46.031 --> 01:16:48.231
Open the door so l can give her a shot.

01:16:49.112 --> 01:16:51.712
Or l swear to God, l'll kill you both.

01:16:52.351 --> 01:16:54.472
lf l open the door, you'll shoot us.

01:16:56.112 --> 01:16:58.592
So give her the shot yourself.

01:16:59.912 --> 01:17:01.632
Give her the shotI

01:17:13.553 --> 01:17:14.793
Do you need this?

01:17:18.753 --> 01:17:20.393
Can you do this yourself?

01:17:25.833 --> 01:17:27.793
What happens if you don't get it?

01:17:29.193 --> 01:17:30.473
Coma.

01:17:32.033 --> 01:17:32.953
Die.

01:17:37.633 --> 01:17:38.873
Fuck! Open it.

lf you step outside, l'll kill her!

01:18:45.436 --> 01:18:50.516
If I see a uniform inside this house,

01:18:51.076 --> 01:18:52.516
Do you understand?

01:18:58.276 --> 01:18:59.197
Yes.

01:19:03.756 --> 01:19:05.757
But please, just give her the shot.

01:19:06.676 --> 01:19:07.517

01:19:09.997 --> 01:19:10.876

01:19:14.237 --> 01:19:15.637
Don't fucking do it.

01:19:16.157 --> 01:19:18.517
While we're in here, she'll call the cops.

01:19:18.677 --> 01:19:20.517
Are you going to open the safe?

01:19:25.877 --> 01:19:27.598
Don't you look at me.

01:19:39.878 --> 01:19:42.198
All l know about this is what l see on TV.

01:19:42.317 --> 01:19:44.158
You got to talk me through this.

01:19:50.958 --> 01:19:52.198
This right here?

01:19:54.358 --> 01:19:55.318
lt's this?

01:20:00.919 --> 01:20:01.958
Yeah, okay.

01:20:09.799 --> 01:20:11.599
Nice house you guys got.

01:20:12.279 --> 01:20:13.759
Your mom's rich.

01:20:16.279 --> 01:20:19.439
Dad's rich. Mom's just mad.

01:20:32.440 --> 01:20:33.680
Tap it.

01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:52.080
l wish l could have put my kid in
a place like this.

01:20:53.200 --> 01:20:54.880
lt's not that l didn't try.

01:20:55.040 --> 01:20:58.560
Sometimes things, they don't work out
the way you want them to.

01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:03.321
Done.

01:21:04.921 --> 01:21:06.920
Wasn't supposed to be like this.

01:21:08.040 --> 01:21:09.680
He had it all worked out.

01:21:10.281 --> 01:21:12.441
Nobody was supposed to even be here.

01:21:15.401 --> 01:21:16.281
Thanks...

01:21:17.601 --> 01:21:18.601
...Burnham.

01:21:24.001 --> 01:21:26.081
Wasn't supposed to be like this.

01:21:30.521 --> 01:21:32.002
She's going to be okay.

01:21:32.922 --> 01:21:35.201
I gave her the shot. She's aII right.

01:21:35.842 --> 01:21:37.401
It'II be over soon.

01:21:55.882 --> 01:21:56.803
Stephan.

01:22:00.282 --> 01:22:01.802
Oh, my god.

01:22:04.923 --> 01:22:06.403
Can you move?

01:22:07.323 --> 01:22:10.643
Not much. l think my arm is broken.

01:22:30.164 --> 01:22:31.403
Raise your arm.

01:22:32.084 --> 01:22:33.684
Come on, raise your arm.

01:22:51.124 --> 01:22:52.404
Try again.

01:22:53.084 --> 01:22:55.004
Come on. Try again.

01:22:57.005 --> 01:23:00.565
Meg, please don't do anything stupid.

01:23:03.165 --> 01:23:05.205
They're going to kill us.

01:23:05.324 --> 01:23:08.005
Just do everything they ask.
lt'll be okay that way.

01:23:08.285 --> 01:23:10.805
Stephan, they'll kill her.

01:23:23.965 --> 01:23:26.845
Holy shit. She called the goddamn cops.

01:23:27.086 --> 01:23:28.365
The police.

01:23:29.325 --> 01:23:30.646
You called the police?

01:23:30.726 --> 01:23:32.485
Of course, l called them.

01:23:33.046 --> 01:23:34.525
You scared the shit out of me.

01:23:34.645 --> 01:23:36.126
She killed the kid.

01:23:37.046 --> 01:23:39.246
She just killed her own kid.

01:23:40.246 --> 01:23:41.646
All right, take this.

01:23:42.726 --> 01:23:44.206
Don't say a word.

01:23:49.167 --> 01:23:51.087
No, her husband must have called them.

01:23:51.166 --> 01:23:53.846
Foreign son of a bitch. l told you!

01:23:55.006 --> 01:23:56.687
Where is she?

01:24:00.767 --> 01:24:01.686
There.

01:24:02.807 --> 01:24:04.406
What the fuck's she doing?

01:24:20.407 --> 01:24:22.007
She's going to handle it.

01:24:25.888 --> 01:24:27.887
l'm just trying to unlock....

01:24:33.927 --> 01:24:36.768
-ls everything okay?
-You all right, ma'am?

01:24:37.888 --> 01:24:40.888
What are you.... What time is it?

01:24:42.568 --> 01:24:44.128
lt's a little after 4:00 a.m.

01:24:44.568 --> 01:24:45.968
We got a call, ma'am.

01:24:47.168 --> 01:24:48.528
Somebody called you?

01:24:50.209 --> 01:24:51.449
Can we come in?

01:24:51.808 --> 01:24:53.049
What do you want?

01:24:53.168 --> 01:24:56.209
-We'd like to come in.
-No, you can't come in.

01:24:56.688 --> 01:24:58.488
Ma'am, you sure you're all right?

01:24:59.249 --> 01:25:00.368
l'm fine.

01:25:01.689 --> 01:25:03.489
Ma'am, you don't look so good.

01:25:11.529 --> 01:25:14.890
Well, you don't look so hot yourself,
Officer Keeney.

01:25:17.090 --> 01:25:18.929
Come on, l'm freezing out here.

01:25:21.730 --> 01:25:22.970
"There are three."

01:25:24.450 --> 01:25:25.249
What?

01:25:26.209 --> 01:25:28.489
Your husband said you called for help.

01:25:28.929 --> 01:25:32.329
That you said, "There are three"
right before you got cut off.

01:25:35.810 --> 01:25:37.370
Oh, that phone call.

01:25:37.730 --> 01:25:39.730
And your neighbors...

01:25:39.850 --> 01:25:44.410
...called in about some loud shouts
or a loudspeaker of some kind?

01:25:47.170 --> 01:25:49.010
That was the TV. lt's off now.

01:25:50.330 --> 01:25:53.770
Can l just ask you one question?

01:25:54.690 --> 01:25:57.050
What was the end of that sentence?

01:25:59.891 --> 01:26:01.970
When you said, "There are three"...

01:26:03.171 --> 01:26:04.531
...what was the rest?

01:26:09.051 --> 01:26:09.931
Look....

01:26:13.571 --> 01:26:15.571
My husband and l just split up...

01:26:16.212 --> 01:26:19.451
...and it's my first night in a new house...

01:26:20.811 --> 01:26:22.892
...and l admit l was a little drunk.

01:26:24.172 --> 01:26:27.452
And the sentence,
if you insist on knowing...

01:26:28.652 --> 01:26:30.052
...was going to be:

01:26:32.252 --> 01:26:36.732
"There are three things that l'll do for you
if you come jump into bed with me."

01:26:40.572 --> 01:26:45.212
Thank God l came to my senses
before l said all that, and l hung up...

01:26:45.892 --> 01:26:48.853
...so nobody would ever have to know
what l was thinking.

01:26:48.932 --> 01:26:50.333
Unless, of course...

01:26:50.613 --> 01:26:54.733
...two policemen came in the middle
of the night and interrogated me.

01:26:58.933 --> 01:27:00.573
So, Rick, you want to go?

01:27:01.133 --> 01:27:03.813
Or do you want her to tell you
which three things?

01:27:08.053 --> 01:27:09.013
All right.

01:27:09.333 --> 01:27:10.293
Ma'am...

01:27:13.733 --> 01:27:16.333
...if there's something you want
to say to us...

01:27:17.494 --> 01:27:20.894
...but maybe you can't say it right now...

01:27:23.414 --> 01:27:26.174
...you might want to make some kind
of a signal...

01:27:26.494 --> 01:27:29.534
...by blinking your eyes a few times.

01:27:31.094 --> 01:27:32.734
Something like that.

01:27:36.214 --> 01:27:39.615
That's something you could do safely.

01:27:49.055 --> 01:27:49.975
Man...

01:27:51.135 --> 01:27:53.094
...you guys are good.

01:27:54.815 --> 01:27:58.294
You mean, like if there was somebody
in the house or something?

01:28:00.295 --> 01:28:02.615
They really train you guys.

01:28:06.415 --> 01:28:08.775
No, l'm fine. l'm fine. Cross my heart.

01:28:18.055 --> 01:28:20.095
Sorry to disturb you, ma'am.

01:28:20.976 --> 01:28:22.175
'Night, ma'am.

01:28:35.656 --> 01:28:37.256
This kid has seen my face.

01:28:37.816 --> 01:28:39.976
Yeah, well, that's not my problem.

01:28:40.256 --> 01:28:43.016
Yeah, it is. You're here with me.

01:28:43.657 --> 01:28:45.177
You're on the hook, too.
