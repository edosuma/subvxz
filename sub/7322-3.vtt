WEBVTT

00:02.203 --> 00:04.535
(Meredith) PARANOIA...

00:04.535 --> 00:06.507
GIVES YOU AN EDGE
IN THE O.R.

00:06.507 --> 00:08.579
WHAT I REALIZED IS THAT--
IS THAT PEDS

00:08.579 --> 00:10.641
IS THE ONLY SPECIALTY
WHERE I COULD DO IT ALL--

00:10.641 --> 00:13.384
YOU KNOW, CARDIO,
GENERAL, ORTHO.

00:13.384 --> 00:15.546
IT'S LIKE THE WHOLE BODY
IS YOUR CANVAS,

00:15.546 --> 00:18.519
AND THE FACT THAT
IT'S A SMALL CANVAS

00:18.519 --> 00:20.020
MAKES IT
EVEN MORE CHALLENGING.

00:20.020 --> 00:22.022
I MEAN, I HAVE NO IDEA

00:22.022 --> 00:24.355
IF YOU HAVE SOMEONE
ON YOUR SERVICE RIGHT NOW,

00:24.355 --> 00:27.098
BUT I WOULD REALLY LOVE
TO WITNESS YOUR ARTISTRY.
YOU GOT THIS?

00:27.098 --> 00:29.260
(Owen) MM-HMM.
YOU GOTTA LIKE KIDS.

00:29.260 --> 00:31.362
I LOVE KIDS.
OKAY. I'LL SEE YOU
ON ROUNDS.

00:31.362 --> 00:32.463
GREAT.

00:32.463 --> 00:34.605
(Alex) OH, HE LOST
A HUGE CHUNK OF FLESH.

00:34.605 --> 00:37.037
I SEE DOWN TO HIS MANDIBLE.
WE'LL NEED PLASTICS

00:37.037 --> 00:39.710
AND AN E.N.T. CONSULT, TOO.
LEFT I.V. LOOKS LIKE
IT'S CLOTTED OFF.

00:39.710 --> 00:42.473
I NEED A NEW 16 GAUGE
IN THERE.
(interns all talking at once)

00:42.473 --> 00:44.715
WHOA, WHOA. WHAT'S GOING ON?
IT'S 4:00 IN THE MORNING.

00:44.715 --> 00:47.518
IS EVERYONE ON CALL?
IT'S THE MERGER.
EVERYONE'S SCARED TO GO HOME.

00:47.518 --> 00:51.051
I DON'T THINK THE CHIEF MEANT
THAT PEOPLE COULDN'T SLEEP.
WELL, IT'S HARD TO SLEEP
WHEN YOUR JOB IS ON THE LINE.

00:51.051 --> 00:53.053
ONE OF YOU, GET AS MUCH
TYPE-SPECIFIC BLOOD

00:53.053 --> 00:56.187
AS THEY'LL LET YOU HAVE
AND MEET US IN SURGERY.

00:56.187 --> 01:00.161
ME! I GOT IT! I CALLED IT!
I CALLED IT! NO!
SURGEONS PLAY OUT WORST-CASE
SCENARIOS IN THEIR HEADS.

01:00.161 --> 01:02.133
I TALKED TO CALLIE
LAST NIGHT

01:02.133 --> 01:04.135
ABOUT THE RESIDENTS
AT MERCY WEST.

01:04.135 --> 01:06.137
SHE SAID THEY DON'T SUCK.

01:06.137 --> 01:08.199
I MEAN, YOU'RE SAFE
BECAUSE OF DEREK.

01:08.199 --> 01:10.701
IZZIE'S SAFE 'CAUSE OF CANCER.
ALEX IS BAILEY'S NEW FAVORITE.

01:10.701 --> 01:12.703
YOU KNOW, EVEN GEORGE
WOULD'VE BEEN SPARED,

01:12.703 --> 01:14.705
'CAUSE HE'S OWEN'S GUY.

01:14.705 --> 01:17.478
CARDIO HAS BEEN
A REVOLVING DOOR AROUND HERE,

01:17.478 --> 01:19.480
AND NO ONE'S GOT MY BACK.
SO ARIZONA IS YOUR COVER?

01:19.480 --> 01:21.552
SHE'S MERGER-PROOF.
SHE KEEPS LITTLE KIDS ALIVE.

01:21.552 --> 01:23.354
NO ONE LIKES A DEAD KID.

01:23.354 --> 01:25.856
PLUS, THEY'RE UNDER ANESTHESIA
HALF THE TIME.

01:25.856 --> 01:27.758
HOW BAD CAN IT BE?

01:27.758 --> 01:30.261
YOU'RE READY TO CLOSE,
YOU GOT THE BLEEDER,

01:30.261 --> 01:33.764
YOU KNOW IT, BUT THERE'S THAT
VOICE IN YOUR HEAD ASKING...

01:33.764 --> 01:36.767
SLOAN AND SHEPHERD ARE SCRUBBING
OUT OF SURGERY IN O.R. TWO.

01:36.767 --> 01:38.769
GRAB 'EM BEFORE THEY LEAVE.
OKAY, AND LET ME KNOW

01:38.769 --> 01:40.771
IF YOU HEAR ANYTHING
ABOUT THE MERGER.

01:40.771 --> 01:43.274
NURSES ARE ALWAYS THE LAST
TO KNOW, FIRST TO GO.

01:43.274 --> 01:44.775
WHAT IF YOU DIDN'T?

01:44.775 --> 01:47.178
WHAT IF THE PATIENT DIES
AND YOU COULD'VE PREVENTED IT?

01:47.178 --> 01:48.779
OH, ALEX?

01:48.779 --> 01:52.613
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
LOOKS REAL, RIGHT?

01:52.613 --> 01:54.615
MY MOM SENT IT TO ME.
(giggles)

01:54.615 --> 01:56.617
UH, WH-WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

01:56.617 --> 01:57.788
WORKING.

01:57.788 --> 01:59.790
IZ, UH,
WE TALKED ABOUT THIS.

01:59.790 --> 02:01.792
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
TAKING ANOTHER THREE WEEKS,

02:01.792 --> 02:04.295
REALLY RESTING UP.
I HAVE TO COME BACK NOW,

02:04.295 --> 02:06.797
BEFORE I DON'T HAVE A JOB
TO COME BACK TO.
IZ--

02:06.797 --> 02:08.799
I HAVE TO SHOW PEOPLE
THAT I'M NOT GONNA DIE.

02:08.799 --> 02:11.502
UNLESS I SIT ALONE IN THAT
TRAILER FOR ONE MORE MINUTE,

02:11.502 --> 02:14.505
THEN I AM GONNA DIE.
I'M GONNA DIE OF BOREDOM.
LOOK, IZZIE--

02:14.505 --> 02:16.637
SERIOUSLY,
IT LOOKS REAL, RIGHT?

02:16.637 --> 02:18.839
I MEAN, IF YOU DIDN'T KNOW
I HAVE CANCER,

02:18.839 --> 02:20.841
YOU WOULDN'T KNOW
I HAVE CANCER, RIGHT?

02:20.841 --> 02:24.775
SO YOU CHECK YOUR WORK
ONE MORE TIME BEFORE YOU CLOSE.

02:24.775 --> 02:27.718
PARANOIA IS
A SURGEON'S BEST FRIEND.

02:27.718 --> 02:29.720
KAREV, WHAT DO YOU GOT?

02:29.720 --> 02:31.722
16-YEAR-OLD HELMETED
DIRT BIKE VICTIM.

02:31.722 --> 02:34.385
G.C.S. 15 REPORTED
BEFORE INTUBATION.

02:34.385 --> 02:36.387
(Derek) OKAY, ON MY COUNT.
READY?

02:36.387 --> 02:37.928
ONE, TWO, THREE.

02:37.928 --> 02:39.660
I'M GONNA SCRUB IN.

02:39.660 --> 02:41.332
SO HE ANNOUNCES A MERGER,

02:41.332 --> 02:44.195
AND THEN HE SHUTS HIMSELF
IN HIS OFFICE ALL DAY

02:44.195 --> 02:46.937
AND REFUSES TO TALK
TO ANYBODY.
THIS MERGER WON'T AFFECT US.

02:46.937 --> 02:50.201
IT'S JUST
A FINANCIAL RESTRUCTURING.
WHAT DO YOU THINK RESTRUCTURING
IS? CUTTING PERSONNEL.

02:50.201 --> 02:53.304
ARE YOU PREPARED TO LOSE
ALL THE GOOD PEOPLE? I'M NOT.

02:53.304 --> 02:57.248
HEY, TELL HUNT HE'S GOOD TO GO.
I'LL WRITE UP A CONSULT LATER.

02:57.248 --> 02:59.310
I'M GONNA GO TALK
TO RICHARD RIGHT NOW.

02:59.310 --> 03:00.881
YOU'RE TIRED. YOU'RE ANGRY.

03:00.881 --> 03:02.513
YOU'RE GONNA SAY SOMETHING
YOU'LL REGRET.

03:02.513 --> 03:04.515
GET OUTTA HERE FOR A WHILE.

03:04.515 --> 03:07.518
GO TO THE DRIVING RANGE,
HIT A BUCKET OF BALLS.
I HAVE A SURGERY
IN AN HOUR.

03:07.518 --> 03:10.491
SO TAKE A WALK.
GRAB MEREDITH, TAKE A WALK.
MEREDITH WON'T LEAVE
THE HOSPITAL.

03:10.491 --> 03:13.364
(Lexie) COMING THROUGH!
NONE OF 'EM WILL. EVERYONE'S
AWAITING WORD FROM ON HIGH.

03:13.364 --> 03:16.397
LOOK, DON'T TELL ME
LEXIE'S NOT WORRIED.

03:16.397 --> 03:19.230
IS HE IN THERE?!
'CAUSE I'VE GOT THE--OH!

03:21.532 --> 03:23.734
NO. LEXIE'S WORRIED.

03:23.734 --> 03:28.208
(sighs)

03:28.208 --> 03:31.211
and brought to you by Ford.
Drive one.

03:31.211 --> 03:33.484
I THINK YOU MISSED
A SPOT.

03:33.484 --> 03:35.986
OKAY, YOU CAN'T TEASE ME
ABOUT THE BLOOD THING

03:35.986 --> 03:37.488
BECAUSE IT'S NOT FUNNY.

03:37.488 --> 03:39.520
AND IF IT GETS BACK
TO THE CHIEF,

03:39.520 --> 03:42.323
I MAY AS WELL
JUST PACK MY THINGS.
YOU NEED TO STOP WORRYING
ABOUT THE CHIEF.

03:42.323 --> 03:44.325
ALL THIS IS IN YOUR HEAD.
REALLY?

03:44.325 --> 03:46.257
2002, MILWAUKEE,

03:46.257 --> 03:48.259
THIRD STREET HOSPITAL
MERGED WITH ST. ANN'S.

03:48.259 --> 03:50.261
13 RESIDENTS WERE LET GO.

03:50.261 --> 03:52.803
2004, NASHVILLE WOMEN'S
ABSORBED MEMORIAL.

03:52.803 --> 03:54.965
NINE RESIDENTS WERE FIRED.

03:54.965 --> 03:56.837
2006, ALBUQUERQUE.
OKAY.

03:56.837 --> 03:58.839
19 RESIDENTS--
ALL RIGHT. WHOA. STOP.

03:58.839 --> 04:01.342
YOU NEED TO
PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER.

04:01.342 --> 04:03.814
YOU DESERVE TO BE HERE.

04:03.814 --> 04:06.377
ACT LIKE IT.

04:06.377 --> 04:08.449
OKAY.

04:08.449 --> 04:10.451
I MEANT LATER.

04:10.451 --> 04:13.824
YOU KNOW, AFTER YOU WENT HOME
AND GOT SOME SLEEP.

04:13.824 --> 04:15.956
(sighs)

04:15.956 --> 04:18.959
YOU KNOW, WE REALLY SHOULD
GET SOME SLEEP BEFORE ROUNDS.

04:18.959 --> 04:21.962
SLEEP IS FOR WIMPS. SLEEP IS
FOR MERCY WEST RESIDENTS.

04:21.962 --> 04:25.996
LET'S, UH, FIT IN
ANOTHER TRAUMA BEFORE ROUNDS.

04:25.996 --> 04:28.999
(lowered voice) DON'T SAY
ANYTHING ABOUT THE WIG.

04:28.999 --> 04:32.503
I'M BACK.
YES, I AM EARLY.

04:32.503 --> 04:34.345
BUT WHATEVER. I'M BACK.

04:34.345 --> 04:36.547
AND BECAUSE I'VE BEEN GONE
SO LONG, THE FIRST TRAUMA

04:36.547 --> 04:39.810
THAT COMES THROUGH THOSE DOORS,
IT'S MINE. GOT IT?

04:43.914 --> 04:45.986
IT'S AMAZING, RIGHT?

04:45.986 --> 04:48.559
WHAT?
WHAT'S AMAZING?
THE WIG.

04:48.559 --> 04:51.692
YEAH. MM-HMM.
OH, IT LOOKS SO REAL,
I COULDN'T EVEN TELL.

04:51.692 --> 04:54.365
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
TO TRY OUT BEING A REDHEAD,

04:54.365 --> 04:57.027
SO I JUST THOUGHT,
NOW'S THE TIME.
WELL, WHAT'S WRONG
WITH YOUR OWN HAIR?

04:57.027 --> 05:00.300
THAT'S PEACH FUZZ CHEMO HAIR,
AND I REALLY WANTED

05:00.300 --> 05:03.303
TO PUT MY PATIENTS AT EASE,
MAKE 'EM FEEL COMFORTABLE.
(lowered voice) SHE LOOKS
LIKE A STEPFORD WIFE.

05:03.303 --> 05:06.306
YOU'VE GOTTA TELL HER.
(lowered voice) SHE CAN'T
HANDLE IT. JUST DON'T STARE.

05:06.306 --> 05:08.639
(siren wails)
M.V.C. WHO DO I HAVE?

05:08.639 --> 05:12.312
(residents all talking at once)
HEY, I'M NOT YOUR CHIEF RESIDENT
ANYMORE. FIGURE IT OUT.

05:12.312 --> 05:15.616
(residents all shouting at once)
KAREV, LET'S GO.

05:15.616 --> 05:18.949
(Cristina) OH!
(siren wails)

05:18.949 --> 05:20.821
YOU'RE BACK.

05:20.821 --> 05:22.753
I AM.

05:22.753 --> 05:25.396
MY MOM'S WHOLE CHURCH
PRAYED FOR YOU.
THANK YOU.

05:25.396 --> 05:27.728
YEAH. IT LOOKS
REALLY REAL.

05:27.728 --> 05:30.461
I KNOW, RIGHT?

05:30.461 --> 05:32.102
WE NEED TO TALK.

05:32.102 --> 05:34.104
LOOK, I'M BUSY RIGHT NOW.

05:34.104 --> 05:35.806
ARE YOU MAKING CUTS?

05:35.806 --> 05:38.469
I SAID I'M BUSY.
IF YOU'RE MAKING CUTS
IN MY DEPARTMENT,

05:38.469 --> 05:41.071
YOU NEED TO CONSULT WITH ME.
WHEN IT'S APPROPRIATE,
I'LL CONSULT THE PEOPLE

05:41.071 --> 05:44.475
I NEED TO CONSULT WITH.
PEOPLE? I'M NOT PEOPLE. I'M
THE GUY THAT SAVED YOUR ASS.

05:44.475 --> 05:46.517
WHEN JENNINGS CAME TO ME,
YOU WERE DONE.

05:46.517 --> 05:50.120
OUT OF LOYALTY TO YOU--
LOYALTY? YOU CAME TO ME SO YOU
WOULD LOOK LIKE A GOOD GUY

05:50.120 --> 05:52.923
BEFORE YOU STOLE MY JOB.
ARE YOU MAKING WHOLE CUTS
OR NOT?

05:52.923 --> 05:54.925
LOOK, I SAID WHEN I'M READY
TO TELL MY STAFF

05:54.925 --> 05:56.957
ABOUT DECISIONS
I WILL BE MAKING, I WILL--

05:56.957 --> 05:58.489
WHEN I'M READY!

05:58.489 --> 06:00.961
SO DON'T COME BARGING IN HERE
LIKE I OWE YOU.

06:00.961 --> 06:04.695
I DON'T OWE YOU A DAMN THING,
DEREK. YOU WORK FOR ME.

06:04.695 --> 06:06.967
I'M STILL THE CHIEF OF SURGERY
AT THIS HOSPITAL.

06:06.967 --> 06:08.939
THEN START ACTING LIKE IT.

06:08.939 --> 06:10.641
(door opens)

06:10.641 --> 06:12.142
(door slams)

06:12.142 --> 06:14.144
JODIE CROWLEY--
60-YEAR-OLD DRIVER

06:14.144 --> 06:16.647
WHO LOST CONSCIOUSNESS
AND HIT A PARKED CAR.

06:16.647 --> 06:19.480
VITAL SIGNS STABLE.
COMPLAINS OF ABDOMINAL PAIN.

06:19.480 --> 06:22.483
IT WASN'T A PARKED CAR.
IT WAS THEM. THEY HIT US.
UH, SIR, WHO ARE YOU?

06:22.483 --> 06:24.915
WHO AM I? WHO ARE YOU?
HE'S MY SON.

06:24.915 --> 06:27.558
(Alex) WHY DON'T WE GO
IN THE WAITING ROOM?

06:27.558 --> 06:30.160
OH, NO. HE--HE NEEDS
TO STAY WITH ME.

06:30.160 --> 06:32.162
HE'S
A PARANOID SCHIZOPHRENIC.

06:32.162 --> 06:35.666
OKAY.

06:35.666 --> 06:36.967
ALL RIGHT.

06:36.967 --> 06:39.830
LET'S PUT HER ON A GURNEY
ON MY COUNT.

06:39.830 --> 06:41.632
ONE, TWO, THREE.

06:43.403 --> 06:44.905
LISTEN TO ME, MOM.

06:44.905 --> 06:47.538
THEY'RE--THEY'RE TRYING
TO GET TO ME THROUGH YOU.

06:47.538 --> 06:50.010
YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ME.
TOM, THEY'RE NOT REAL.

06:50.010 --> 06:53.113
LOOK AT ME.
LOOK AT ME, HONEY.
DID YOU FEEL DIZZY

06:53.113 --> 06:55.986
OR LIGHT-HEADED
BEFORE THE CRASH?
NO, I FELT FINE.

06:55.986 --> 06:59.119
OKAY, ABDOMINAL TENDERNESS.
I FEEL A MASS.

06:59.119 --> 07:01.091
I--I'VE HAD IT
FOR QUITE A WHILE.

07:01.091 --> 07:04.094
MAYBE THAT'S WHAT CAUSED ME
TO BLACK OUT.
I'VE BEEN WARNING HER.

07:04.094 --> 07:07.998
THEY'RE TRYING TO HURT HER,
BUT SHE WON'T BELIEVE ME.
TOM, LOOK AT ME.

07:07.998 --> 07:11.101
YOU KNOW
I WOULDN'T LIE TO YOU.
NO. NO!
YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ME.

07:11.101 --> 07:13.464
SOMEONE HAS TO BELIEVE ME.

07:13.464 --> 07:16.837
ALIENS HAVE IMPREGNATED
MY MOTHER.

07:18.969 --> 07:22.843
(thumping)

07:35.526 --> 07:38.128
THE CHIEF WAS SPOTTED
FIVE HOURS AGO IN THE CAFETERIA.

07:38.128 --> 07:41.131
HE GOT AN APPLE AND A YOGURT.
AND THEN HE MET
WITH DR. SHEPHERD.

07:41.131 --> 07:44.134
THE MEETING WAS BRIEF
AND HEATED.
THEN HE DREW THE BLINDS.
HE'S PROBABLY SLEEPING.

07:44.134 --> 07:46.136
THAT'S SPECULATION.
WE HAVE NO PROOF OF THAT.

07:46.136 --> 07:49.069
YOU'D MAKE A GOOD LAWYER...
IF THIS DOESN'T WORK OUT.
OUCH.

07:49.069 --> 07:51.141
OKAY, DR. YANG.
YOU READY FOR ROUNDS?

07:51.141 --> 07:53.203
YES. OH, UM...

07:53.203 --> 07:55.205
CONTINUE WITH
YOURCOURSE OF TREATMENT

07:55.205 --> 07:58.649
AND KEEP ME UPDATED
ON ANY NEW DEVELOPMENTS.

07:58.649 --> 08:00.150
(elevator bell dings)

08:00.150 --> 08:02.012
YOU KNOW,
YOU DON'T LOOK READY.

08:02.012 --> 08:05.085
NO, I'M READY. I LOOKED OVER
YOUR PATIENT CHARTS,

08:05.085 --> 08:07.087
AND I NOTICED YOU HAVE
A SHOCK WAVE LITHOTRIPSY

08:07.087 --> 08:09.660
SCHEDULED FOR KIDNEY STONES
THIS MORNING,

08:09.660 --> 08:12.663
AND I WAS--OH. I'M, UH,
I'VE NEVER DONE ONE OF THOSE,

08:12.663 --> 08:15.225
SO I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IT.
OKAY. NOW YOU'RE READY.

08:15.225 --> 08:16.927
OH.
COME ON. LET'S GO.

08:16.927 --> 08:18.599
OKAY. THANKS.

08:18.599 --> 08:21.101
OKAY, HOW LONG
HAVE YOU HAD THE GROWTH?

08:21.101 --> 08:23.103
CAN YOU COVER THE CLOCK?

08:23.103 --> 08:26.176
THE NUMBER 5 BOTHERS HIM.

08:26.176 --> 08:29.179
UH, YEAH. CAN YOU GET SOMETHING
TO COVER THE CLOCK?

08:31.882 --> 08:34.014
ARE THOSE CAMERAS?

08:34.014 --> 08:37.017
TOMMY, WHAT DO WE NEED
FROM THE STORE?

08:37.017 --> 08:39.019
WHY WON'T
THEY LEAVE ME ALONE?

08:39.019 --> 08:42.653
TOMMY, DO WE NEED FRUIT?
YEAH. WHY WON'T YOU
LEAVE ME ALONE?

08:42.653 --> 08:45.295
WHAT KIND OF FRUIT
DO WE NEED, HONEY?

08:45.295 --> 08:48.528
TOM, WHAT KIND OF FRUIT?

08:48.528 --> 08:51.832
UM... APPLES,

08:51.832 --> 08:55.235
PEARS, STRAWBERRIES.

08:55.235 --> 08:57.537
MAKE A LIST.

08:57.537 --> 09:00.741
COULD YOU GIVE HIM A-A PENCIL
AND SOME PAPER?
YEAH.

09:00.741 --> 09:03.043
HE NEEDS SOMETHING TO
DISTRACT HIM FROM THE VOICES.

09:03.043 --> 09:05.776
OKAY, UH, MA'AM,
THE GROWTH?

09:05.776 --> 09:07.778
OH. UH, YEAH.
I'M SORRY.

09:07.778 --> 09:09.780
I--I'VE HAD IT
FOR A WHILE.

09:09.780 --> 09:12.082
UH, I'VE BEEN MEANING
TO GET IT CHECKED,

09:12.082 --> 09:14.084
BUT AS YOU CAN SEE,

09:14.084 --> 09:17.688
MY SON'S ILLNESS
IS A FULL-TIME JOB.

09:19.790 --> 09:21.091
KAREV, I'M GONNA NEED YOU

09:21.091 --> 09:23.063
TO GET MR. CROWLEY'S
WRIST X-RAYED

09:23.063 --> 09:25.065
WHILE I GET HER
UP TO M.R.I.

09:25.065 --> 09:27.067
WHY CAN'T ONE OF THESE
FETUSES BABYSIT?

09:27.067 --> 09:29.770
IF THAT HUGE THING'S
A TRIPLE-A, I WANT IN.

09:29.770 --> 09:31.672
I CAN DO THE WRIST.
(interns shout)

09:31.672 --> 09:34.574
DR. KAREV HAS MORE EXPERIENCE.
THE PATIENT IS PARANOID
AND HYPERVIGILANT,

09:34.574 --> 09:36.977
WHICH MEANS HE'S BOUND
TO PICK UP ON THE FACT

09:36.977 --> 09:38.979
THAT DR. KAREV
DOESN'T WANT TO BE HERE,

09:38.979 --> 09:41.281
AND HE MAY INTERPRET THAT
AS DR. KAREV

09:41.281 --> 09:43.954
BEING OUT TO GET HIM.

09:43.954 --> 09:45.786
I ACED MY PSYCH CLERKSHIP.

09:48.088 --> 09:49.690
(sighs)
HEY.

09:49.690 --> 09:51.692
HEY.
HOW'D IT GO
WITH THE CHIEF?

09:51.692 --> 09:53.694
RICHARD'S NOT TALKING
TO ME.
WHAT? WHY?

09:53.694 --> 09:56.697
I DON'T KNOW. HE'S JUST--
HE'S NOT--HE'S NOT HIMSELF.

09:56.697 --> 09:58.629
WELL, WHAT'S HE DOING?
HE'S HIDING OUT.

09:58.629 --> 10:00.631
OH.
HOW ARE YOU HOLDING UP, HMM?

10:00.631 --> 10:03.173
YOU'VE BEEN UP FOR, LIKE,
WHAT, 36 HOURS?

10:03.173 --> 10:05.676
48. BUT I'M GOOD, ACTUALLY.

10:05.676 --> 10:07.938
I FEEL LIKE
IT'S ALL GONNA BE OKAY,

10:07.938 --> 10:09.710
LIKE WE'RE ALL
GONNA KEEP OUR JOBS

10:09.710 --> 10:11.712
AND WE'RE ALL GONNA BE
AMAZING PEOPLE

10:11.712 --> 10:13.283
AND LIVE AMAZING LIVES.

10:13.283 --> 10:15.285
(laughs) UNSTABLE CHILDHOOD.

10:15.285 --> 10:17.818
AH, YES.
I GET CALM IN A CRISIS.

10:17.818 --> 10:19.690
THIS IS A CRISIS, RIGHT?

10:19.690 --> 10:22.092
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS IS.

10:22.092 --> 10:24.124
(sighs)

10:24.124 --> 10:26.096
OH, LOOK WHO'S COMING.

10:26.096 --> 10:31.662
(gasps) OH, UM, DR. YANG,
HAVE YOU SEEN SAGE?

10:31.662 --> 10:34.134
(laughs)
SHE'S 6, LIGHT BROWN HAIR,
GORGEOUS BLUE EYES.

10:34.134 --> 10:37.207
SHE JUST HAD A TUMOR REMOVED
FROM HER BELLY,

10:37.207 --> 10:39.169
SO SHE HAS A BANDAGE
ON HER TUMMY.

10:39.169 --> 10:41.411
YOU KNOW WHAT? HEY, WHY DON'T
YOU CHECK UNDER THE BED?

10:41.411 --> 10:43.413
MAYBE SHE'S THERE.
(laughs)

10:43.413 --> 10:46.847
HER LABS ARE BETTER
THAN WE EXPECTED.
UH, SHE'S NOT
UNDER THE BED.

10:46.847 --> 10:50.951
HUH. WHOA. I... MM.
UH, MAYBE TRY THE BATHROOM?

10:50.951 --> 10:52.683
MAYBE SHE SLIPPED IN THERE?

10:52.683 --> 10:55.686
(laughs)
HOW DID SHE DO LAST NIGHT?
DID SHE GET ANY SLEEP?

10:55.686 --> 10:57.688
(woman) SHE DID. I DIDN'T.

10:57.688 --> 10:59.129
UM, BATHROOM'S CLEAR.

10:59.129 --> 11:02.893
(laughing)
(Arizona) WAIT. SHH.
SHH, SHH, SHH.

11:02.893 --> 11:05.135
I THINK
THAT THERE'S SOMETHING

11:05.135 --> 11:07.938
COMING FROM YOUR POCKET.

11:07.938 --> 11:11.071
IS SAGE INSIDE YOUR POCKET?

11:13.303 --> 11:17.007
NO, NO, UM...
SHE'S HIDING HERE.

11:17.007 --> 11:19.009
YOU GOTTA LOOK
IN YOUR POCKET FIRST.

11:19.009 --> 11:21.311
NO, I DON'T,
BECAUSE I FOUND YOU ALREADY.

11:21.311 --> 11:24.084
NOW I JUST NEED TO CHECK
YOUR INCISION SITE, SO--

11:24.084 --> 11:26.086
DON'T TOUCH IT. IT HURTS.

11:26.086 --> 11:29.689
YOU KNOW, I BET THAT MR. BEAR
WOULD LIKE TO SEE SAGE'S SCAR.

11:29.689 --> 11:31.691
WOULDN'T YOU, MR. BEAR?

11:31.691 --> 11:34.094
OH, UM...

11:34.094 --> 11:36.897
(deep voice) YES, I WOULD.

11:36.897 --> 11:40.330
(clears throat)

11:40.330 --> 11:42.072
(woman) DR. MacDONALD,
CATH LAB.

11:42.072 --> 11:44.234
DR. MacDONALD, CATH LAB.

11:44.234 --> 11:48.078
DR. STEVENS. I'M SURPRISED
TO SEE YOU BACK SO SOON.

11:48.078 --> 11:50.080
YOU LOOK GREAT.
THANK YOU. SO DO YOU.

11:50.080 --> 11:53.243
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?
I FEEL GREAT.
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

11:53.243 --> 11:56.146
NO, WHAT I MEANT WAS--
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.
I FEEL FINE. I'M READY TO WORK.

11:56.146 --> 11:58.148
HERE IS MR. TRINIDAD'S
LATEST PRE-OP LABS.

11:58.148 --> 12:01.221
I TOLD HIM YOU'D STOP IN TO SAY
HELLO BEFORE THE SURGERY.

12:01.221 --> 12:02.953
AND UNLESS
THERE'S ANYTHING ELSE

12:02.953 --> 12:04.955
YOU CAN THINK OF
THAT I NEED TO KNOW,

12:04.955 --> 12:07.758
I WAS GONNA RUN
TO GET HIS CONSENT FORM.
THAT PRETTY MUCH COVERS IT

12:07.758 --> 12:11.101
UNLESS ANYBODY HAS
ANY QUESTIONS.
IS THERE ANYTHING YOU CAN
TELL US ABOUT THE MERGER?

12:11.101 --> 12:13.233
BECAUSE I'M HAVING A BABY.

12:13.233 --> 12:15.305
I MEAN MY WIFE
IS HAVING A BABY.

12:15.305 --> 12:18.268
I MEAN RESIDENT MEGAN
IS HAVING A BABY.

12:18.268 --> 12:22.012
I MEAN--
AM I GONNA LOSE MY JOB?
RIGHT NOW, I'M CONCERNED
ABOUT MY PATIENT.

12:22.012 --> 12:24.214
YOU SHOULD BE, TOO.

12:26.146 --> 12:29.950
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

12:29.950 --> 12:32.082
I JUST GOT MY HAIR CUT.

12:32.082 --> 12:35.225
OH. WELL, IT LOOKS NICE.
(women giggling)

12:35.225 --> 12:37.457
THE NURSE OUT THERE,
THE ONE WITH THE RED HAIR,

12:37.457 --> 12:39.459
SHE'S LAUGHING AT ME.
(giggling continues)

12:39.459 --> 12:43.093
YOU TELL HER I JUST GOT IT CUT,
AND THEY CUT IT TOO SHORT,

12:43.093 --> 12:45.365
AND THAT'S WHY
MY EARS ARE STICKING OUT.

12:45.365 --> 12:47.537
I'M SURE
SHE'S NOT LAUGHING AT YOU.

12:47.537 --> 12:49.269
HOW'S THAT FEEL?

12:52.042 --> 12:54.444
IT FEELS LIKE MY...
HAND'S FALLING OFF.

12:54.444 --> 12:58.008
IT FEELS LIKE...

12:58.008 --> 13:01.111
THEY PUT SOMETHING IN IT
TO MAKE MY HAND FALL OFF,

13:01.111 --> 13:04.154
LIKE IT'S SNAKES
OR SOMETHING.

13:04.154 --> 13:06.156
YOU DON'T HAVE A NAME TAG.

13:06.156 --> 13:08.889
UM...

13:08.889 --> 13:12.062
OH, I-I-I GUESS I DON'T.

13:13.894 --> 13:16.897
THE OTHER DOCTOR HAD
A NAME TAG ON HER COAT.

13:16.897 --> 13:19.269
I-I HAD TO CHANGE
MY LAB COAT,

13:19.269 --> 13:22.332
AND THIS ONE--
YOU THINK I'M AN IDIOT?

13:22.332 --> 13:24.574
YOU'RE WORKING FOR THEM.
YOU'VE GOT MY MOTHER,

13:24.574 --> 13:26.907
AND NOW YOU'RE TRYING
TO GET ME.

13:26.907 --> 13:29.239
STAY AWAY FROM US.

13:29.239 --> 13:32.282
I KEEP TELLING YOU PEOPLE
TO STAY AWAY FROM US!
(grunts and groans)

13:32.282 --> 13:35.846
(panting)

13:46.326 --> 13:48.198
I CALLED SECURITY.
THEY'RE ON THEIR WAY.

13:48.198 --> 13:50.901
WHERE'S PSYCH? I ASKED YOU
TO PAGE THEM AN HOUR AGO.
I PAGED THEM TWICE.

13:50.901 --> 13:53.904
IF YOU WANT TO SEE
THE LOG BOOK--
NO, I-I WANT TO KNOW
HOW A PARANOID PATIENT

13:53.904 --> 13:55.906
MANAGED TO
GET OUT OF THE E.R.

13:55.906 --> 13:58.909
WHERE WERE YOU?
I HAD STEPPED AWAY FROM MY DESK
TO DEAL WITH ANOTHER PATIENT.

13:58.909 --> 14:01.111
AND NORMALLY, BEING
A PUNCHING BAG FOR THE DOCTORS

14:01.111 --> 14:04.844
IS JUST A PART OF THE JOB,
BUT THERE'S A MERGER,

14:04.844 --> 14:07.177
AND WE'RE ALL BEING LOOKED AT,

14:07.177 --> 14:10.180
AND I AM NOT ABOUT TO GO DOWN
FOR A MISTAKE THAT WASN'T MINE.

14:10.180 --> 14:13.253
SO IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
I'LL PAGE PSYCH AGAIN.

14:13.253 --> 14:14.955
OKAY, MR. TRINIDAD,

14:14.955 --> 14:16.957
YOUR SHUNT REVISION
IS PRETTY SIMPLE.

14:16.957 --> 14:18.959
IT SHOULDN'T TAKE
LONGER THAN AN HOUR.

14:18.959 --> 14:20.961
BUT I DO NEED TO GO OVER

14:20.961 --> 14:23.964
THE POSSIBLE COMPLICATIONS
WITH YOU.
DR. STEVENS,
COULD I HAVE A WORD?

14:23.964 --> 14:26.336
UH, IF YOU COULD JUST GIVE ME
A MINUTE UNTIL I'M DONE HERE,

14:26.336 --> 14:29.169
DR. KAREV.
I'M SORRY. THIS WILL
ONLY TAKE A MINUTE.

14:29.169 --> 14:31.241
EXCUSE ME.

14:31.241 --> 14:33.243
WHAT?
HOW ARE YOU HOLDING UP?

14:33.243 --> 14:35.545
FINE.
DID YOU TAKE
YOUR MEDS THIS MORNING?

14:35.545 --> 14:38.548
NOT YET, BUT I WILL.
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO
TAKE THEM AT 9:00.

14:38.548 --> 14:40.911
IT'S ONLY
A LITTLE AFTER 9:00.
IT'S 10:15.

14:40.911 --> 14:43.153
RUN DOWN TO HER LOCKER
AND GET HER MEDS.

14:43.153 --> 14:46.286
ARE THEY IN YOUR PURSE?
YES, BUT YOU DON'T
HAVE TO GET THEM.

14:46.286 --> 14:48.288
YES, YOU DO.
NO, YOU DON'T. ALEX.

14:48.288 --> 14:51.421
I SWEAR TO GOD, IF YOU DON'T GO
AND GET HER PILLS RIGHT NOW,

14:51.421 --> 14:54.194
I'M GONNA HURT YOU
AND I'M GONNA LIKE IT.

14:54.194 --> 14:55.895
(elevator bell dings)

14:55.895 --> 14:58.528
YOU CAN'T DO THIS. YOU CAN'T
TREAT ME LIKE I'M SICK.

14:58.528 --> 15:01.531
MY PATIENTS NEED TO HAVE FAITH
IN ME. WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
YOUR WIG, IT WAS CROOKED.

15:01.531 --> 15:03.233
OW.
(sighs)

15:03.233 --> 15:06.937
LOOK, I'LL STOP HOVERING IF YOU
STOP ACTING LIKE AN IDIOT.

15:06.937 --> 15:09.179
YOUR NEXT PILL IS AT 2:00.

15:09.179 --> 15:12.312
YOU CAN'T TAKE IT
ON AN EMPTY STOMACH.

15:12.312 --> 15:14.314
OKAY.

15:16.246 --> 15:18.188
TYLER LEE, 9 YEARS OLD,
CAME IN WITH RENAL COLIC

15:18.188 --> 15:20.190
THREE DAYS AGO
THAT HAS NOT RESOLVED.

15:20.190 --> 15:22.222
WE ARE GOING TO BE PERFORMING

15:22.222 --> 15:24.224
EXTRACORPOREAL
SHOCK WAVE THERAPY TODAY

15:24.224 --> 15:27.927
TO BREAK UP THE STONES
IN HIS URETER SO THEY CAN PASS.
NO, WE'RE NOT.

15:27.927 --> 15:30.230
OH, UH, YES, WE ARE.

15:30.230 --> 15:32.302
NO, WE'RE NOT,
'CAUSE THERE WAS NO BLOOD

15:32.302 --> 15:34.304
IN HIS URINE THIS MORNING.
UM, JUST IN CASE?

15:34.304 --> 15:36.606
WE SHOULD DO THE PROCEDURE
JUST IN CASE?

15:36.606 --> 15:39.609
YOU WANT TO DO A SURGICAL
PROCEDURE ON A 9 YEAR OLD

15:39.609 --> 15:42.612
EVEN THOUGH
IT'S NO LONGER INDICATED?

15:42.612 --> 15:44.614
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

15:44.614 --> 15:47.617
OKAY. SO, DR. YANG, DO YOU
WANT TO TELL THE GOOD NEWS

15:47.617 --> 15:51.181
TO TYLER AND HIS MOM?

15:51.181 --> 15:53.283
IT SEEMS AS THOUGH
YOUR SON'S STONES

15:53.283 --> 15:55.986
MAY HAVE PASSED ON THEIR OWN.

15:55.986 --> 15:59.259
HE DOESN'T NEED SURGERY?
(Arizona) NO. LOOKS LIKE
HE HEALED HIMSELF.

15:59.259 --> 16:01.961
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT, DR. YANG?
ON YOUR FIRST DAY IN PEDS.

16:01.961 --> 16:04.334
NO, I CAN'T, ACTUALLY.
DOES THIS MEAN I CAN EAT?

16:04.334 --> 16:07.167
YEAH, YEAH. DR. YANG
CAN GO GET YOU SOMETHING.

16:09.539 --> 16:11.541
(Miranda)
AN ABDOMINAL AORTIC ANEURYSM--

16:11.541 --> 16:13.373
8.7 CENTIMETERS.

16:13.373 --> 16:15.705
THIS THING HAS A 75% CHANCE
OF RUPTURING.

16:15.705 --> 16:19.279
YEAH. SHE'S A TICKING TIME BOMB.
I'M SURPRISED SHE WOKE UP
THIS MORNING,

16:19.279 --> 16:21.281
LET ALONE GOT INTO A CAR.

16:21.281 --> 16:24.184
OKAY, CANCEL ALL MY ELECTIVE
SURGERIES THIS AFTERNOON

16:24.184 --> 16:25.485
AND BOOK AN O.R.

16:25.485 --> 16:28.058
WE NEED TO
GET HER IN THERE A.S.A.P.

16:28.058 --> 16:29.419
OKAY, UH, JODIE, WE'RE DONE.

16:29.419 --> 16:32.022
I'LL MEET YOU BACK DOWNSTAIRS
TO GO OVER THE RESULTS.

16:32.022 --> 16:35.065
HAVE YOU SEEN TOM?
I THOUGHT HE WAS WITH YOU?

16:35.065 --> 16:38.368
HE WAS, BUT HE LEFT. WELL, HE
ATTACKED ME, AND THEN HE LEFT.

16:38.368 --> 16:41.031
HE... YOU TOLD ME
YOU COULD HANDLE THIS.

16:41.031 --> 16:43.473
NO, I-I-I CA--IT'S
UNDER CONTROL. DON'T WORRY.

16:43.473 --> 16:46.005
I'VE CALLED SECURITY.
I JUST--I JUST THOUGHT MAYBE

16:46.005 --> 16:49.008
HIS MOM WOULD HAVE AN IDEA--
HIS MOM HAS A TRIPLE-A.
THE LAST THING SHE NEEDS TO KNOW

16:49.008 --> 16:52.011
IS THAT HER MENTALLY ILL SON
IS LOOSE IN THE HOSPITAL.

16:52.011 --> 16:54.314
I KNOW THIS IS BAD. I KNOW
THIS IS REALLY, REALLY BAD.

16:54.314 --> 16:56.716
I-I KNOW--
OKAY, I'M GONNA STOP
LISTENING TO YOU

16:56.716 --> 16:59.489
BECAUSE THE WORDS
YOU ARE SAYING ARE HURTING ME.

16:59.489 --> 17:01.451
FIND HIM!
YES.

17:10.760 --> 17:13.763
YOU LOOK CRAZY.
OH, THIS IS PARTLY
YOUR FAULT.

17:13.763 --> 17:16.766
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO TOLD ME TO GO
ACT LIKE I DESERVE TO BE HERE,

17:16.766 --> 17:19.309
AND I DID, AND NOW
I LOST A SCHIZOPHRENIC.

17:19.309 --> 17:22.312
AND I AM GONNA BE FIRED UNLESS
I FIND THE SCHIZOPHRENIC.

17:22.312 --> 17:24.274
WELL, YOU'RE NOT GONNA
FIND HIM BACK THERE.

17:24.274 --> 17:26.776
YOU DO NOT GET TO BE
CHARMED BY THIS

17:26.776 --> 17:29.048
BECAUSE THIS
IS NOT CHARMING!

17:29.048 --> 17:31.721
THIS IS ME GETTING CUT
FROM THE PROGRAM.

17:31.721 --> 17:34.354
YOU'RE ALREADY AMAZING.
I AM JUST STARTING OUT, OKAY?

17:34.354 --> 17:37.127
I HAVE NEVER STAPLED A BOWEL,

17:37.127 --> 17:39.129
AND I HAVE NEVER RESECTED
AN ESOPHAGUS.

17:39.129 --> 17:40.730
I AM NOT AMAZING YET!

17:40.730 --> 17:43.133
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S JUST BREATHE.
(exhales)

17:43.133 --> 17:44.434
AND AGAIN.
(inhales and exhales deeply)

17:44.434 --> 17:46.296
GOOD. LOOK AT ME.

17:46.296 --> 17:48.198
SECURITY IS ON THIS.

17:48.198 --> 17:52.242
YOU HAVE BECOME A CRAZY PERSON
I DO NOT RECOGNIZE.

17:52.242 --> 17:55.245
I WANT LEXIE BACK.
CAN I GET LEXIE BACK?

17:55.245 --> 17:58.278
(Tom) STAY AWAY FROM ME!
YOU GET BACK! STOP! GET BACK!
OH, GOD, THAT'S HIM.

17:58.278 --> 18:00.680
JUST--
WHERE'S MY MOTHER?
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH HER?

18:00.680 --> 18:03.383
NO!
ALL RIGHT, SIR.
JUST CALM DOWN. SIR!

18:03.383 --> 18:06.656
(grunts and groans)

18:09.789 --> 18:12.422
(groans)

18:23.273 --> 18:25.805
MRS. CROWLEY, THERE IS EVIDENCE
THAT YOUR SON

18:25.805 --> 18:27.807
MAY HAVE SUFFERED SOME INJURY
IN THIS FALL.

18:27.807 --> 18:30.540
NOW WE DON'T THINK
THAT IT'S BAD,

18:30.540 --> 18:33.313
BUT WE JUST NEED TO DO
AN ULTRASOUND TO MAKE SURE.

18:33.313 --> 18:36.346
HE'S BEEN SEDATED,
BUT I NEED YOU TO WAIT HERE

18:36.346 --> 18:40.150
UNTIL WE'VE COMPLETED THIS,
ALL RIGHT?
I NEVER
SHOULDA LEFT HIM ALONE.

18:40.150 --> 18:42.522
I KNEW IT. I KNEW IT.
OKAY, UM, MRS. CROWLEY,

18:42.522 --> 18:45.225
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT YOUR TEST RESULTS.

18:45.225 --> 18:48.328
THE WALL OF YOUR AORTA
IS DANGEROUSLY THIN

18:48.328 --> 18:50.560
AND COULD BURST AT ANY MOMENT,

18:50.560 --> 18:53.403
AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS,
IT WILL MOST LIKELY KILL YOU.

18:53.403 --> 18:55.735
I'M NOT MINCING MY WORDS
RIGHT NOW

18:55.735 --> 18:59.209
BECAUSE I NEED YOU TO UNDERSTAND
THE SEVERITY OF THE SITUATION.

18:59.209 --> 19:01.571
I NEED TO TAKE YOU
UP TO SURGERY RIGHT NOW.

19:01.571 --> 19:03.613
I CAN'T. I CAN'T
HAVE SURGERY RIGHT NOW.

19:03.613 --> 19:06.246
I CAN'T LEAVE TOM.
HE'S INJURED. HE'S UPSET.

19:06.246 --> 19:08.578
THIS HAS BEEN
A ROUGH DAY ON HIM.

19:08.578 --> 19:10.620
I CAN'T. NO.
IT'LL HAVE TO WAIT.

19:10.620 --> 19:13.323
WELL, ISN'T THERE SOMEONE
THAT YOU CAN CALL?

19:13.323 --> 19:15.154
NO.

19:15.154 --> 19:17.457
MY EX-HUSBAND LEFT
WHEN TOM FIRST GOT SICK,

19:17.457 --> 19:19.459
AND FRIENDS HAVE FALLEN AWAY.

19:19.459 --> 19:21.361
IT'S ONLY ME.

19:22.892 --> 19:25.765
WELL, WE HAVE SERVICES,
SO, UH, WE CAN ARRANGE TO--

19:25.765 --> 19:29.539
I CAN'T JUST LEAVE HIM
WITH A STRANGER.

19:29.539 --> 19:31.901
I NEED TIME...

19:31.901 --> 19:35.745
TO HIRE SOMEONE
A-A-AND TRAIN THEM

19:35.745 --> 19:37.747
TO KNOW
THAT IF HE'S WATCHING TV

19:37.747 --> 19:39.749
AND HE'S HOLDING HIS HEAD
A CERTAIN WAY,

19:39.749 --> 19:41.751
IT MEANS THE TELEVISION
IS TALKING TO HIM

19:41.751 --> 19:44.354
AND HE NEEDS TO BE DISTRACTED.

19:44.354 --> 19:46.356
HE LIKES SHOPPING,

19:46.356 --> 19:48.318
BUT THEY CAN'T TAKE HIM
TO THE PLACE ON LEE ROAD

19:48.318 --> 19:50.320
BECAUSE HE THINKS
THEY'RE OUT TO GET HIM.

19:50.320 --> 19:52.792
SO THEY HAVE TO GO
TO THE PLACE ON RIVER ROAD.

19:52.792 --> 19:54.794
BUT THEY'VE GOTTA PARK
IN THE BACK,

19:54.794 --> 19:57.297
BECAUSE UNDERGROUND PARKING
MAKES HIM UPSET.

19:57.297 --> 20:00.400
AND IT GOES ON AND ON AND ON.

20:00.400 --> 20:01.701
SO, NO.

20:01.701 --> 20:03.303
PLEASE...

20:03.303 --> 20:05.605
I NEED TIME.

20:05.605 --> 20:07.307
A-A WEEK.

20:07.307 --> 20:10.310
I'VE MADE IT THIS LONG.
I CAN MAKE IT ANOTHER WEEK.

20:10.310 --> 20:12.812
I'M NOT SURE THAT YOU HAVE
ANOTHER WEEK.

20:12.812 --> 20:17.287
LOOK, I NEED YOU TO THINK
ABOUT YOURSELF RIGHT NOW.

20:17.287 --> 20:19.849
I HAVE A MENTALLY ILL SON.

20:19.849 --> 20:23.893
I DON'T GET TO THINK OF
JUST MYSELF ANYMORE.

20:32.432 --> 20:34.264
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

20:34.264 --> 20:36.766
HEY. WHOA.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

20:36.766 --> 20:38.938
OH, I WAS JUST, UM,

20:38.938 --> 20:41.941
UH, I JUST STOPPED BY
TO GET SOME OLD CASE FILES.

20:41.941 --> 20:43.443
FOR WHAT?

20:43.443 --> 20:45.445
UM, THIS JOB OPENING
IN PORTLAND.

20:45.445 --> 20:46.776
OREGON?

20:46.776 --> 20:48.778
YEAH. UH, THE MERGER.

20:48.778 --> 20:51.481
I MEAN, THE CHIEF ALREADY
GOT RID OF ME ONCE, SO...

20:51.481 --> 20:53.353
(metal rattling)

20:53.353 --> 20:55.585
YEAH. NO, WELL, IT'S--
THAT'S SMART.

20:55.585 --> 20:58.658
THAT'S SMART OF YOU
TO HAVE BACKUPS.

20:58.658 --> 21:00.360
(clears throat)

21:00.360 --> 21:01.661
(mutters)

21:01.661 --> 21:03.363
(mouths word)

21:03.363 --> 21:05.695
HEY, UH, YOU KNOW,
I'M WORKING WITH CRISTINA.

21:05.695 --> 21:07.397
SHE'S INTERESTED IN PEDS.

21:07.397 --> 21:08.538
(laughs) NO, SHE ISN'T.

21:08.538 --> 21:10.039
YEAH, SHE IS.

21:10.039 --> 21:11.371
OKAY.

21:11.371 --> 21:13.373
WELL, WHAT? DID SHE
SAY SOMETHING TO YOU?

21:13.373 --> 21:15.675
(chuckles) SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO.
SHE'S CRISTINA.

21:15.675 --> 21:17.777
OH, OKAY, YOU HAVE TO
HELP ME OUT HERE,

21:17.777 --> 21:21.511
'CAUSE I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS.
I SHOULDN'T SAY ANYTHING.
SHE'S MY ROOMMATE.

21:21.511 --> 21:24.354
AND YOU'RE MY GIRLFRIEND.
GIRLFRIEND TRUMPS ROOMMATE.

21:24.354 --> 21:27.517
OKAY, FINE. SHE'S CRISTINA.
SHE'S ALL ABOUT CARDIO.

21:27.517 --> 21:29.519
SO SHE'S PROBABLY
SUCKING UP TO YOU

21:29.519 --> 21:32.392
TO GET THROUGH THE MERGER.

21:32.392 --> 21:34.994
I MEAN, IS SHE GOOD
WITH THE KIDS?
(elevator bell dings)

21:34.994 --> 21:37.467
OH. SHE'S SUCKING UP.

21:37.467 --> 21:38.928
YEAH.

21:38.928 --> 21:40.600
(laughs)

21:40.600 --> 21:42.772
(sighs)

21:42.772 --> 21:44.474
NICE PIN.

21:44.474 --> 21:47.777
HIS NAME'S MR. BEAR.
HE EATS CHILDREN.

21:47.777 --> 21:50.340
NOT HAVING FUN IN PEDS?

21:50.340 --> 21:52.642
WELL, MY KID WANTS
CHOCOLATE PUDDING REALLY BADLY.

21:52.642 --> 21:54.584
THIS IS THE LAST ONE.

21:54.584 --> 21:56.416
MY TRIPLE-A GOT CANCELED.

21:56.416 --> 21:59.349
YOU GUYS GOT ANY SURGERIES
I CAN GET IN ON?
NO, I'M ON POST-OPS.

21:59.349 --> 22:01.651
AND SHE'S BABYSITTING.
YOU KNOW, I CAN'T
STAND IT ANY LONGER.

22:01.651 --> 22:03.593
CAN'T YOU GO TO THE CHIEF

22:03.593 --> 22:05.655
AND USE YOUR DEAD-MOMMY
CONNECTIONS TO GET SOME ANSWERS?

22:05.655 --> 22:08.558
WE DON'T NEED DEAD MOMMY.
WE ARE GOING TO BE FINE.

22:08.558 --> 22:10.560
OKAY, SO I LET
A CRAZY MAN ESCAPE,

22:10.560 --> 22:13.363
AND HE FELL DOWN
A FLIGHT OF STAIRS.
IS IT SURGICAL?

22:13.363 --> 22:15.405
I DON'T KNOW.
I GOT KICKED OFF THE CASE.

22:15.405 --> 22:17.637
SO THEN I WENT
TO GO WATCH A SURGERY.

22:17.637 --> 22:19.609
I FIGURED,
I CAN'T SCREW THAT UP.

22:19.609 --> 22:21.741
AND THE SECOND
I GET TO THE GALLERY,

22:21.741 --> 22:23.913
THE SHUNT WENT SOUTH
AND STARTS BLEEDING.

22:23.913 --> 22:26.576
I LEFT BEFORE SHEPHERD
COULD BLAME ME FOR IT.
SHEPHERD'S SHUNT WENT BAD?

22:26.576 --> 22:28.648
YEAH, THEY HAD TO CONVERT
TO AN OPEN CRANIOTOMY--

22:28.648 --> 22:31.120
SOMETHING I'LL PROBABLY
NEVER GET A CHANCE TO DO.
SHE CAN'T HANDLE
A CRANIOTOMY.

22:31.120 --> 22:32.822
SEE? EVEN HE SEES IT.

22:32.822 --> 22:36.486
NO, HE'S NOT TALKING ABOUT YOU.
HE'S TALKING ABOUT IZZIE.

22:36.486 --> 22:38.528
(sighs)
I REALLY ADMIRE YOU--

22:38.528 --> 22:41.591
IN CASE I GET CUT AND DON'T GET
A CHANCE TO TELL YOU.

22:41.591 --> 22:43.633
PLUS, YOU'RE REALLY PRETTY.

22:43.633 --> 22:45.364
(woman)
♪ WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA ♪

22:45.364 --> 22:47.397
YOU CAN HAVE THE REST.

22:47.397 --> 22:48.938
(sighs)

22:48.938 --> 22:52.902
AND YOU AND I,
WE WERE GETTING SO CLOSE.

22:52.902 --> 22:56.406
I NEED TO SPEAK
WITH DR. STEVENS, PLEASE.

22:56.406 --> 22:59.078
ALEX, I'M IN SURGERY.
IZZIE.

22:59.078 --> 23:01.911
ALEX, LEAVE.

23:01.911 --> 23:03.413
DR. SHEPHERD,

23:03.413 --> 23:05.485
COULD YOU PLEASE TELL
DR. KAREV TO LEAVE?

23:05.485 --> 23:08.488
KAREV.
SHE GETS TIRED
WALKING TO THE MAILBOX.

23:08.488 --> 23:10.660
SHE CAN'T HANDLE
ANOTHER 5-HOUR SURGERY.

23:10.660 --> 23:13.923
I KNOW WHAT I CAN HANDLE.
NO ONE'S GONNA THINK
ANY LESS OF YOU

23:13.923 --> 23:16.926
IF YOU WALK OUT OF HERE NOW.
JUST WALK OUT NOW.

23:16.926 --> 23:20.600
STEVENS,
HAVE THIS CONVERSATION OUTSIDE.
NO, I'M NOT LEAVING. ALEX.

23:28.538 --> 23:30.540
YOU PAGED ME.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

23:30.540 --> 23:33.543
YOU HAVE TO TELL THE CHIEF
THAT YOU NEED ME,

23:33.543 --> 23:35.785
THAT GEORGE WAS YOUR GUY,
BUT HE DIED.

23:35.785 --> 23:37.747
SO YOU NEED A NEW GUY,
AND THAT'S ME.

23:37.747 --> 23:40.119
OKAY? RIGHT NOW. LET'S GO.
GO, GO, GO.

23:40.119 --> 23:43.052
OH, COME ON. IF ANYONE'S SAFE
IN THIS MERGER, IT'S YOU.
JUST BE CASUAL BUT FIRM.
HE LIKES YOU. GO.

23:43.052 --> 23:45.194
CRISTINA, I C--

23:45.194 --> 23:48.197
I PLAYED HIDE-AND-SEEK TODAY
AND DIDN'T GO TO SURGERY

23:48.197 --> 23:50.900
BECAUSE SOME 9 YEAR OLD
MIRACULOUSLY PEED WITHOUT BLOOD.

23:50.900 --> 23:52.902
OKAY? I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE.
THEN DON'T.

23:52.902 --> 23:55.134
TELL DR. ROBBINS YOU DON'T
THINK PEDS IS YOUR THING.

23:55.134 --> 23:57.837
WHAT IS THE BIG DEAL?
THE BIG DEAL IS THAT
THE CHIEF IN THERE RIGHT NOW

23:57.837 --> 23:59.609
MAKING A LIST...
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

23:59.609 --> 24:02.441
A LIST OF WHO STAYS
AND WHO GOES,

24:02.441 --> 24:05.475
AND I CAN'T BE ON
THAT "GOES" LIST.
IF YOU ARE,
YOU WILL DEAL WITH THAT.

24:05.475 --> 24:07.517
(mutters) "IF" I AM? OKAY,
IF I--THERE CAN BE NO IF.

24:07.517 --> 24:09.519
I HAVE TO BE
ON THE "STAYS" LIST.

24:09.519 --> 24:11.751
THAT LIST IS EVERYTHING.
THAT LIST IS MY FUTURE.
CALM DOWN.

24:11.751 --> 24:13.753
IT'S MY SALVATION.
CRISTINA--

24:13.753 --> 24:16.756
THE LIST IS LIFE.
SCHINDLER'S LIST?

24:16.756 --> 24:19.188
YOU'RE COMPARING THIS MERGER
TO THE HOLOCAUST?

24:19.188 --> 24:21.190
I'M JEWISH. I'M ALLOWED.

24:21.190 --> 24:22.792
YOU'RE IRRATIONAL.

24:22.792 --> 24:25.464
(pager beeps)

24:25.464 --> 24:27.767
SO THIS IS A NO?
THIS IS A NO.

24:27.767 --> 24:30.069
HMM. (mutters)

24:32.842 --> 24:34.844
AND SOMEBODY PAGE SLOAN AGAIN,
STAT.

24:34.844 --> 24:37.246
(woman) RIGHT AWAY, DOCTOR.

24:37.246 --> 24:39.679
OKAY, ELIZABETH,

24:39.679 --> 24:42.081
TAKE ME THROUGH
EXACTLYWHAT HAPPENED.

24:42.081 --> 24:45.154
I WAS DOING A CRASH C-SECTION
ON THIS 32-WEEKER.

24:45.154 --> 24:48.187
I HAD THE INCISION DONE
IN FIVE MINUTES FLAT.

24:48.187 --> 24:50.189
BUT I MUST HAVE CUT TOO DEEP,

24:50.189 --> 24:52.962
BECAUSE WHEN I WENT IN
TO TAKE THE BABY,

24:52.962 --> 24:54.524
I PULLED THE ARM A LITTLE,
AND THE--
OH, MY GOD.

24:54.524 --> 24:56.495
(Arizona) GET ME
THE UMBILICAL CORD.

24:56.495 --> 24:59.599
UMBILICAL CORD? WH--
JUST GET IT.

25:15.545 --> 25:17.547
I GOT IT.
I GOT THE UMBILICAL CORD.

25:17.547 --> 25:20.049
(Arizona) GOOD. GIVE ME
ABOUT 5 CENTIMETERS OF IT.

25:20.049 --> 25:22.552
WHAT'S GOING ON?
ARM GOT DAMAGED
DURING A STAT "C."

25:22.552 --> 25:25.154
I'M GONNA USE THE UMBILICAL
ARTERY IF IT'S STILL VIABLE.

25:25.154 --> 25:27.526
IT LOOKS A LITTLE DRY.

25:29.659 --> 25:32.531
IT LOOKS LIKE
IT'S GONNA WORK.
SHE'S STABLE.

25:32.531 --> 25:34.564
LET'S PUT IT
IN ANTIBIOTIC SOLUTION

25:34.564 --> 25:37.066
AND MOVE THIS PARTY
TO THE O.R.

25:37.066 --> 25:40.640
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

25:42.241 --> 25:44.774
I'M SORRY. I JUST, UH...

25:44.774 --> 25:47.216
I WANTED TO MAKE SURE
THAT YOU'RE OKAY.

25:47.216 --> 25:49.278
ARE YOU OKAY?

25:49.278 --> 25:51.280
I INJURED MY SPLEEN,

25:51.280 --> 25:53.883
AND THEY'RE JUST WAITING

25:53.883 --> 25:56.886
TO SEE IF IT STOPS BLEEDING
ON ITS OWN.

25:56.886 --> 25:58.187
GOOD. UM...

25:58.187 --> 26:01.090
WELL, I'M--I'M GLAD YOU SEEM...

26:01.090 --> 26:03.162
WELL, YOU SEEM BETTER,

26:03.162 --> 26:04.994
AND I'M GLAD.

26:04.994 --> 26:06.996
ANYWAY, I SHOULD, UH,
I SHOULD GO.

26:06.996 --> 26:08.998
I'M NOT REALLY
SUPPOSED TO BE HERE, SO...

26:08.998 --> 26:12.001
OH, IT'S ALL RIGHT. THEY--
THEY'VE GOT ME IN RESTRAINTS.

26:12.001 --> 26:14.003
I WOULDN'T
BE ABLE TO HURT YOU

26:14.003 --> 26:17.246
EVEN IF THE VOICES
TOLD ME TO.

26:17.246 --> 26:19.979
IT'S A JOKE.
(chuckles)

26:19.979 --> 26:21.851
SCHIZOPHRENIA HUMOR.

26:21.851 --> 26:23.983
(chuckles)

26:23.983 --> 26:26.285
UM...

26:26.285 --> 26:28.988
THERE'S THIS THOUGHT
THAT I...

26:28.988 --> 26:32.121
I'M--I'M TRYING TO GET IT OUT,
AND, UM...

26:32.121 --> 26:35.965
I KEEP THINKING
THAT THEY PLANTED A CAMERA...

26:35.965 --> 26:39.829
UH, IN M-MY STOMACH
DURING THE ULTRASOUND.

26:39.829 --> 26:41.831
AND I-I WAS GONNA
WAKE MY MOTHER

26:41.831 --> 26:44.333
AND--AND HAVE HER,
YOU KNOW, TALK ME DOWN,

26:44.333 --> 26:46.375
BUT SHE'S TIRED, AND...

26:56.345 --> 26:58.347
(machine beeps)

26:58.347 --> 27:02.351
HERE IS... YOUR SPLEEN.

27:02.351 --> 27:04.023
SEE?

27:04.023 --> 27:06.225
AND THIS, UH, THIS BRIGHT SPOT
RIGHT HERE,

27:06.225 --> 27:07.727
THAT'S--THAT'S BLOOD.

27:07.727 --> 27:09.729
THAT'S NOT
SUPPOSED TO BE THERE.

27:09.729 --> 27:13.002
BUT, UM, NO CAMERA.

27:14.704 --> 27:16.836
NO CAMERA.

27:16.836 --> 27:18.367
MNH-MNH.

27:18.367 --> 27:21.410
I CAN LEAVE THIS UP
IF--IF YOU WANT.

27:21.410 --> 27:24.413
SO THAT WHEN THE THOUGHTS
COME BACK,

27:24.413 --> 27:26.415
YOU--YOU CAN LOOK
AND YOU CAN SEE THAT--

27:26.415 --> 27:28.277
THAT THEY'RE NOT REAL.

27:28.277 --> 27:30.079
THEY'RE JUST SCARY THOUGHTS.

27:30.079 --> 27:32.982
THEY'RE NOT REAL.

27:39.358 --> 27:42.291
(suction gurgling)

27:42.291 --> 27:45.765
THANK YOU.

27:45.765 --> 27:47.767
LITTLE MORE SUCTION.
(knock on window)

27:47.767 --> 27:49.939
IT'S 2:00, IZZIE.

27:49.939 --> 27:51.340
OH, MY GOD.

27:51.340 --> 27:54.774
STEVENS, NO MORE FIGHTING
IN MY O.R. GO DEAL WITH THIS.

27:54.774 --> 27:57.306
(suction gurgling)

27:57.306 --> 27:59.278
(door opens)

27:59.278 --> 28:01.210
I HATE YOU.

28:01.210 --> 28:03.382
SHUT UP.

28:09.959 --> 28:11.260
OKAY.

28:19.698 --> 28:21.200
(sighs) OH, GOD.

28:21.200 --> 28:23.072
(inhales deeply)

28:23.072 --> 28:24.804
THANK YOU.

28:24.804 --> 28:27.436
SHUT UP.
GET BACK TO WORK.

28:27.436 --> 28:30.379
HMM.

28:37.787 --> 28:40.389
NO. SHE'S GONNA GO HOME,
AND SHE'S GONNA DIE.

28:40.389 --> 28:43.793
THEN WHAT'S THAT BOY
GONNA BE LEFT WITH?
HE NEEDS SURGERY.

28:43.793 --> 28:45.795
W-WELL, DOES HE NEED
A TRANSFUSION?

28:45.795 --> 28:48.497
IS THERE ACTIVE BLEEDING?
NO, HIS CRIT'S STABLE.

28:48.497 --> 28:51.200
AND I KNOW WE DON'T OPERATE
UNLESS THERE'S AN ACTIVE BLEED,

28:51.200 --> 28:52.862
BUT IT'S SO CLOSE,

28:52.862 --> 28:55.204

SHE'LL LET US OPERATE ON HER.

28:55.204 --> 28:57.206
THAT WAY,
WE CAN KEEP THEM TOGETHER.

28:57.206 --> 28:59.038

THROUGH THE RECOVERY,

28:59.038 --> 29:01.110

AND MAYBE YOU THINK

29:01.110 --> 29:03.943
THIS IS A BAD IDEA, THAT I'M
PROPOSING UNNECESSARY SURGERY.

29:03.943 --> 29:05.945
AND MAYBE
YOU'LL TELL THE CHIEF,

29:05.945 --> 29:08.918
AND THE CHIEF WILL THINK THAT
IT MAKES ME A BAD DOCTOR.

29:08.918 --> 29:11.380
BUT I THINK IT MAKES ME
A GOOD DOCTOR, AND I THINK--
STOP TALKING.

29:11.380 --> 29:14.083

HURTING YOU AGAIN?
NO, YOU'RE RIGHT.

29:14.083 --> 29:16.285

JUST NOT PAYING ATTENTION?

29:22.061 --> 29:23.762

ACTUALLY WENT UP LAST QUARTER.

29:34.443 --> 29:36.445

WHICH WENT DOWN 13%.

29:36.445 --> 29:38.447

29:38.447 --> 29:41.450
