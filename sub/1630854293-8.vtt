Yeah, yeah. It spooked her
pretty good though.

10:40.378 --> 10:42.859
But, Deacon, she's talking about
getting a gun for protection.

10:42.903 --> 10:44.556
She said something about Annie
doing the same thing?

10:44.600 --> 10:46.210
Yeah, she did.

10:46.254 --> 10:48.865
When our house got shot up.
But she loves it now.

10:48.909 --> 10:51.346
She's at the range
twice a month.

10:51.389 --> 10:53.783
Does it make her
feel better? Safer?I think so.

10:53.827 --> 10:56.699
What scares me is the thought of
her actually having to use it.

10:56.743 --> 10:58.658
See? You just nailed
what's been bugging me.

10:58.701 --> 11:00.834
Look, I ain't got no issues
with guns, obviously,

11:00.877 --> 11:02.574
but ever since
Nichelle brought it up,

11:02.618 --> 11:04.011
all I can think about is

11:04.054 --> 11:05.621
all the different ways
things could go sideways.

11:05.665 --> 11:07.101
Yeah.
I mean, I don't know.

11:07.144 --> 11:08.711
I mean, I guess the mental
calculus changes

11:08.755 --> 11:10.191
when it's somebody
you love, right?

11:10.234 --> 11:11.496
Wait until
your kid is born.

11:11.540 --> 11:12.759
The phrase "worst
case scenario"

11:12.802 --> 11:14.586
takes on a whole
new meaning.

11:14.630 --> 11:16.327
Hey, speaking of which, I heard
Matthew got in a little scuffle.

11:16.371 --> 11:18.982
Got suspended.
Is he all right?Yeah, yeah. He's fine.

11:19.026 --> 11:21.637
Some bully just, you know,
beat on him a little bit.

11:21.681 --> 11:23.334
I showed him a couple
combinations.

11:23.378 --> 11:24.814
In case it happens again,
he'll be able to at least

11:24.858 --> 11:26.468
defend himself.
Attaboy.[phone chimes]

11:28.209 --> 11:29.863
[groans]
Oh, boy.

11:30.994 --> 11:32.996
What's up?It's Annie.

11:33.040 --> 11:35.956
Apparently, one of the mothers
from Matthew's classroom,

11:35.999 --> 11:38.001
she came by and she's accusing
Matthew of starting the fight.

11:38.045 --> 11:39.742
[chuckles] Okay, wait a minute,
are you sure about that?

11:39.786 --> 11:41.222
I mean, no offense,

11:41.265 --> 11:42.702
but Matthew's more of a
bean pole than a boxer.

11:43.703 --> 11:45.052
Uh-oh.

11:45.095 --> 11:46.880
That's the other kid?Yeah.

11:46.923 --> 11:48.359
Looks pretty definitive.

11:48.403 --> 11:51.058
Maybe you should ease up
on those boxing lessons.

11:55.584 --> 11:56.933
Just talked to
my brother.

11:56.977 --> 11:58.152
He said it looks like
Leticia's friend, Adam,

11:58.195 --> 11:59.501
will pull through.Oh, awesome.

11:59.544 --> 12:01.242
All right.
I'll let her know.

12:01.285 --> 12:02.939
Hey, hold up.

12:02.983 --> 12:04.767
Things looked a little tense
with you and Xiamara earlier.

12:04.811 --> 12:06.769
Everything all right
with the food truck?

12:06.813 --> 12:08.118
Yeah, course.
Why?

12:08.162 --> 12:10.120
Well, the team and I
do own a stake in it.

12:10.164 --> 12:11.600
But I'm asking
as a friend.

12:11.643 --> 12:13.820
Truth is, Leticia's
kind of right.

12:13.863 --> 12:16.779
I'm not as excited about
Guate-Mama's anymore.What happened?

12:16.823 --> 12:18.520
I thought business
was booming.It is.

12:18.563 --> 12:19.826
It's been than ever,
honestly.

12:19.869 --> 12:21.653
It's just...
we do need more help.

12:21.697 --> 12:23.090
I just haven't made the time.

12:23.133 --> 12:25.048
Look, I bought the food truck

12:25.092 --> 12:27.050
because I thought it would
bring the team together,

12:27.094 --> 12:28.660
you know,
keep us all connected.

12:28.704 --> 12:30.750
But now that
Chris is gone,

12:30.793 --> 12:32.447
and, I don't know,
everyone seems

12:32.490 --> 12:35.755
preoccupied with their own
lives and relationships...

12:35.798 --> 12:37.844
it feels like I failed.

12:37.887 --> 12:40.020
And that truck is just
a reminder of that failure.

12:40.063 --> 12:42.500
Hey, Guate-Mama's
isn't a failure.

12:42.544 --> 12:46.069
But I do think you put some
unrealistic expectations on it.

12:46.113 --> 12:47.767
What do you mean?My man,
you see the world

12:47.810 --> 12:49.333
through SWAT-colored glasses.

12:49.377 --> 12:51.335
We all want SWAT to last
forever, but we know it can't.

12:51.379 --> 12:53.033
Maybe it's time
you start thinking about

12:53.076 --> 12:54.643
what'll really make you
happy in the long term.

12:54.686 --> 12:56.471
I thought the food truck
would help with that,

12:56.514 --> 12:57.733
you know?Yeah.

12:57.777 --> 12:59.126
You remember
how excited you were

12:59.169 --> 13:00.388
the first time we all
tried Xiamara's cooking?

13:00.431 --> 13:01.868
Yeah.
Yeah.

13:01.911 --> 13:04.261
I know you get that same
excited look on your face

13:04.305 --> 13:05.741
every time a new customer
comes up to the truck.

13:05.785 --> 13:07.134
I've seen it.

13:07.177 --> 13:08.962
Maybe don't give up
on the dream just yet.

13:09.005 --> 13:10.702
[phone chimes]

13:12.748 --> 13:14.315
All right.

13:14.358 --> 13:15.795
Food Truck Don
just landed.

13:15.838 --> 13:17.492
Let's go.

13:20.408 --> 13:22.236
Ernie Delgado?

13:22.279 --> 13:23.846
This about
the food trucks

13:23.890 --> 13:25.935
that got attacked today?LUCA:
Good guess.

13:25.979 --> 13:27.241
What do you know about them?

13:27.284 --> 13:29.069
Just that the people
who got attacked

13:29.112 --> 13:30.853
crossed the wrong dude.

13:30.897 --> 13:32.246
Wrong dude being you?Is this your way of

13:32.289 --> 13:33.900
getting the competition
to back off your turf?

13:33.943 --> 13:36.424
Hey.
[chuckles]

13:36.467 --> 13:38.252
That is not
how I do business.

13:38.295 --> 13:39.557
You don't get the nickname

13:39.601 --> 13:41.255
"Food Truck Don of L.A."
by playing nice.

13:41.298 --> 13:45.346
Look, I'll admit to using
some intimidation tactics

13:45.389 --> 13:47.609
to keep my trucks
on the best corners.

13:47.652 --> 13:50.351
But I draw the line
at hurting people.

13:50.394 --> 13:52.875
So whoever's behind
these attacks...

13:52.919 --> 13:55.008
they go by a different
set of rules.

13:55.051 --> 13:58.576
And besides, I would never go
after my own flesh and blood.

13:58.620 --> 14:00.404
Oh, so you're saying
someone from your family

14:00.448 --> 14:01.884
got hit by this crew?

14:01.928 --> 14:05.105
Yeah, my cousin Mikey's
spot in Hollywood.

14:05.148 --> 14:07.237
What's the name of
his food truck?It's not a truck.

14:07.281 --> 14:09.152
He owns a restaurant
called Don Viva's.

14:09.196 --> 14:11.154
And the mole is...
it's amazing.

14:11.198 --> 14:13.200
Ernie, focus.

14:13.243 --> 14:15.158
The crew
at the restaurant.

14:15.202 --> 14:18.074
Mikey said that the gunmen only
took a couple of boxes of food.

14:18.118 --> 14:20.076
Didn't touch
the cash register,

14:20.120 --> 14:21.904
didn't even go
after the office safe.

14:21.948 --> 14:23.384
So it's not just
food trucks.[phone chimes]

14:23.427 --> 14:26.648
These guys must be after
something specific.

14:28.911 --> 14:30.913
Black SUV matching the
suspects' getaway vehicle

14:30.957 --> 14:33.176
just spotted
near Glassell Park.

14:33.220 --> 14:34.656
[tires screeching]

14:36.614 --> 14:38.007
Out.

14:38.051 --> 14:39.791
Now.

14:41.271 --> 14:43.099
Open up the back.It's unlocked.

14:45.493 --> 14:48.322
Take anything you want,
just don't shoot. Please.

14:54.284 --> 14:56.330
[siren wailing]

15:11.867 --> 15:13.216
LUCA:
Hey, you guys follow the rabbit.

15:13.260 --> 15:14.696
We've got the SUV!

15:19.092 --> 15:20.702
On it!

15:24.445 --> 15:26.490
[siren wailing]

15:28.884 --> 15:31.626
It's too tight.
Got to hoof it.

15:31.669 --> 15:33.758
30-David. In foot pursuit,
southbound in an alley.

15:33.802 --> 15:35.847
Just off San Fernando.

15:40.287 --> 15:42.811
[groans]

15:42.854 --> 15:45.205
Give me your hands
behind your back!DEACON: 30-David.

15:45.248 --> 15:46.771
One suspect in custody.

15:46.815 --> 15:49.296
Tan, what's your status?TAN:
25-David.

15:49.339 --> 15:51.951
Suspect's heading east
on Avenue 35.

15:51.994 --> 15:53.430
We're in pursuit.

15:54.649 --> 15:55.998
[tires screeching]

16:06.356 --> 16:07.662
[tires screeching]

16:21.763 --> 16:23.243
LUCA:
Okay, I'm gonna try
a pit maneuver.

16:23.286 --> 16:24.896
That truck's twice
the size of this Charger.

16:24.940 --> 16:26.072
You got a better idea?

16:34.210 --> 16:35.385
Luca, swerve!

16:41.348 --> 16:42.697
[grunts]

16:42.740 --> 16:44.046
22-David. We lost sight
of the suspects.

16:44.090 --> 16:45.874
Last seen heading
south on Central.

16:45.917 --> 16:48.746
Was that a freaking grenade?Sure as hell
wasn't a speed bump.

16:48.790 --> 16:51.140
Something tells me these
aren't your everyday crooks.

16:53.055 --> 16:56.363
Deac, truck driver says
they cut him off,

16:56.406 --> 16:57.755
then grabbed boxes
from the back.

16:57.799 --> 16:59.061
DEACON:
We know they're not after money,

16:59.105 --> 17:00.845
but all this carnage
for some produce?

17:00.889 --> 17:02.108
Looks like they were
after avocados.

17:03.326 --> 17:04.588
DEACON:
Wait a second.

17:05.633 --> 17:07.330
There's more going on here.

17:10.899 --> 17:12.248
Now we know why.

17:12.292 --> 17:14.903
These avocados are packed
with cocaine.

17:21.127 --> 17:22.737
I've heard of drugs being
transported in gas tanks,

17:22.780 --> 17:25.174
children's toys, even
live animals and people.

17:25.218 --> 17:26.958
But this one
takes the cake.

17:27.002 --> 17:29.352
I mean, how the hell did they
even get the drugs inside there

17:29.396 --> 17:30.832
and still
make it look seamless?

17:30.875 --> 17:32.355
I don't know,
whatever magic they used,

17:32.399 --> 17:34.009
there's no clear difference
between one of these

17:34.053 --> 17:35.837
and your average avocado
at the local grocery store.

17:35.880 --> 17:37.099
Except the eight ball
that falls out

17:37.143 --> 17:38.796
as you're prepping
dinner.Yeah.

17:38.840 --> 17:40.537
I mean, packaging drugs like
this makes it near impossible

17:40.581 --> 17:42.278
to intercept them
during transport.

17:42.322 --> 17:44.237
Something this sophisticated
and methodical,

17:44.280 --> 17:45.629
it's got to be a cartel.

17:45.673 --> 17:47.501
Consider that confirmed.

17:47.544 --> 17:49.155
Just got a positive ID
on our food truck shooter

17:49.198 --> 17:51.418
from this morning.
Ramon Garza.

17:51.461 --> 17:55.248
He's a suspected hit man
for the Baja Renegados Cartel.

17:55.291 --> 17:56.727
The suspect
we just arrested

17:56.771 --> 17:59.339
is Manny Leyva,
another cartel hit man.

17:59.382 --> 18:02.429
Along with...Peter Medina
and Felix Soto.

18:02.472 --> 18:05.214
Together, better known as
the Four Horsemen.

18:05.258 --> 18:06.781
Yeah, they're
a cartel hit squad

18:06.824 --> 18:08.522
suspected in over
a dozen murders

18:08.565 --> 18:09.958
throughout
Southern California.

18:10.001 --> 18:11.655
Along with countless others
across the border.

18:11.699 --> 18:13.309
I mean, this crew is vicious.

18:13.353 --> 18:14.919
One of them is notorious
for using hand grenades

18:14.963 --> 18:16.356
to carry out his hits.

18:16.399 --> 18:18.053
Yeah, I caught his
matinee show earlier with Tan.

18:18.097 --> 18:20.011
Definitely plan on
skipping the encore.

18:20.055 --> 18:22.797
If the Four Horsemen are
chasing down these drugs,

18:22.840 --> 18:24.929
we might've interrupted
a cartel turf war.

18:24.973 --> 18:26.714
Well, we won't know for sure
until we figure out

18:26.757 --> 18:28.324
where these avocados
came from.

18:28.368 --> 18:29.934
[sighs]

18:31.022 --> 18:32.981
I had no idea there were
drugs in them.

18:33.024 --> 18:35.114
I was just making my
usual deliveries.

18:35.157 --> 18:36.332
Deliveries for who?

18:36.376 --> 18:38.465
My job. Kedzie Produce.

18:38.508 --> 18:41.424
That some kind of
cartel front?Cartel?

18:41.468 --> 18:42.686
No way.

18:42.730 --> 18:44.253
Kedzie's a legit
produce company.

18:44.297 --> 18:46.168
We supply to customers
all over the city.

18:46.212 --> 18:47.169
Restaurants,

18:47.213 --> 18:49.258
grocery stores,
food trucks,

18:49.302 --> 18:51.826
you name it.Does that include a food truck
called Manila Meltdown?

18:51.869 --> 18:53.349
Or Don Viva restaurant,
in Hollywood?

18:53.393 --> 18:55.264
Delivered to both of them
this morning.

18:55.308 --> 18:58.180
I bet Kedzie Produce supplies
to all the businesses

18:58.224 --> 18:59.660
the Four Horsemen hit.

18:59.703 --> 19:00.748
If Kedzie's the source
of the avocados...

19:00.791 --> 19:02.663
They could be a target, too.

19:05.753 --> 19:08.190
It's right down here.

19:08.234 --> 19:10.584
Patrol really caught the guys
who broke in this morning?

19:10.627 --> 19:12.194
I sure as hell hope so.

19:12.238 --> 19:14.153
You're the only one
who can tell us for sure.

19:14.196 --> 19:16.416
You said you got a good look
at one of them, right?Mm-hmm.

19:16.459 --> 19:17.721
Okay.

19:21.856 --> 19:23.684
HONDO:
Suspects are being
brought in as we speak.

19:25.686 --> 19:28.689
I've been mulling it
over all day,

19:28.732 --> 19:33.172
and I think I do
want to get a gun.

19:33.215 --> 19:35.783
Are you sure?All I could think
about this morning

19:35.826 --> 19:38.742
was the need to protect
myself and our baby.

19:38.786 --> 19:41.789
Maybe a gun will make me
feel safer, more in control.

19:41.832 --> 19:43.225
In the right hands,

19:43.269 --> 19:46.315
with the right training,
guns do save lives.

19:46.359 --> 19:48.970
But it comes with
a lot of risk, Nichelle,

19:49.013 --> 19:50.667
especially
in homes with kids.

19:50.711 --> 19:52.539
Children in homes with guns

19:52.582 --> 19:54.454
are three times more likely to
die from accidental shooting.

19:54.497 --> 19:57.631
And even more likely to be
seriously injured, I know.

19:57.674 --> 19:59.937
That's why I never wanted one
at the community center.

19:59.981 --> 20:02.418
But at the same time,
I don't want to feel scared

20:02.462 --> 20:04.159
in my own workplace.

20:05.987 --> 20:07.206
Here they come.

20:12.080 --> 20:13.864
I know him.

20:13.908 --> 20:15.736

Agent Simons

20:48.116 --> 20:49.509
over at the DEA.

20:49.552 --> 20:51.206
Now, their working theory

20:51.250 --> 20:53.513
is that these avocados
are tied to a DEA raid

20:53.556 --> 20:56.429
on a Baja Renegados
shipping depot in Mexico.

20:56.472 --> 20:58.082

went down last week,

mostly empty.Let me guess.

move their drugs in a hurry?

in that missing shipment.
