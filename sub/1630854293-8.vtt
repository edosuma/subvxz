00:01.436 --> 00:02.611
Previously onSWAT...

00:06.136 --> 00:07.833
ANNIE:
I'm not blaming you.
I just... Ever since

00:09.748 --> 00:11.054
Our kids need
to talk through this. since

00:12.751 --> 00:14.449
LUCA: There's no point
to tal doing all this worke

00:16.233 --> 00:17.800
part of it. This could be a team
toinvestment, and with the way

00:17.843 --> 00:21.108
Xiamara cooks, man, there's
nothing like it out there.

00:21.151 --> 00:22.587
I've been dreaming
of this my whole life.

00:22.631 --> 00:24.328
Now I get to do that
and be SWAT.

00:25.329 --> 00:27.375
â™ª

00:33.120 --> 00:34.773
[grunts]

00:36.123 --> 00:38.647
Tia! The window's stuck again!

00:38.690 --> 00:40.910
Need a hand?

00:40.953 --> 00:44.044
Don't think I'm supposed to
fraternize with the competition.

00:44.087 --> 00:46.394
Well, I won't tell if you won't.

00:48.309 --> 00:49.788
Look, I got to take care
of a couple things,

00:49.832 --> 00:51.225
but I'll be back soon,
Xiamara, okay?

00:51.268 --> 00:52.226
You promised help,

00:52.269 --> 00:53.531
then you don't show.

00:53.575 --> 00:55.229
First last week, now today.

00:55.272 --> 00:56.230
I'm sorry. Some stuff
came up with SWAT.

00:56.273 --> 00:57.666
SWAT this, SWAT that.

00:57.709 --> 00:59.276
No time for this business.

00:59.320 --> 01:00.973
No time for us.

01:01.017 --> 01:03.106
My niece, Leticia, is
helping me, but it's not enough.

01:03.150 --> 01:05.456
Okay, I'm gonna get
more help soon.

01:05.500 --> 01:07.154
A ver.

01:09.547 --> 01:12.246
I can't keep on
doing this alone!

01:15.205 --> 01:17.381
Looks like you're in a bit
of a pickle, bro, huh?

01:17.425 --> 01:19.644
[laughs]
Yeah, I'm gonna,

01:19.688 --> 01:23.039
uh, go back to my...

01:23.083 --> 01:24.954
food stall.

01:25.911 --> 01:27.870
That's it. Jab, jab.

01:27.913 --> 01:29.306
One, two. One, two.

01:29.350 --> 01:30.960
Good. Again.

01:31.003 --> 01:32.744
And with that free hand,
protect your face.

01:32.788 --> 01:34.746
Can't have raccoon eyes
for your school photo.

01:34.790 --> 01:36.139
Your mom will kill me.

01:36.183 --> 01:37.793
H-I-I-T?

01:37.836 --> 01:39.447
Yeah, High-Intensity
Interval Training.

01:39.490 --> 01:41.710
It's great for a quick workout,
gets the heart rate up.

01:41.753 --> 01:43.364
Yeah, we used
to call that "running."

01:43.407 --> 01:44.669
STREET:
Hey!

01:44.713 --> 01:46.106
What's up, Matthew?

01:46.149 --> 01:47.368
Uncle Street, Uncle Bob,
how you guys been?

01:47.411 --> 01:48.978
How you doing?Whoa!

01:49.021 --> 01:50.893
That's a heck of a shiner
you got there, kid.

01:50.936 --> 01:52.590
DEACON:Yeah.

01:52.634 --> 01:53.939
Why don't you go hit
the heavy bag

01:53.983 --> 01:54.853
until your mom comes
and gets you?

01:54.897 --> 01:55.985
Good to see you guys.

01:56.028 --> 01:58.379
You, too, Matty.See you, buddy.

01:58.422 --> 02:00.772
He got that black eye in a fight
after school yesterday.

02:00.816 --> 02:02.861
He's serving
his suspension today.

02:02.905 --> 02:04.341
I never pegged Matty
as the fighting type.

02:04.385 --> 02:06.343
Any idea what started it?Uh, no.

02:06.387 --> 02:07.997
I'm not sure. None of
the teachers saw it happen.

02:08.040 --> 02:09.955
He's not saying much.

02:09.999 --> 02:13.176
You know, Matthew's always been
quiet, a little bit of a loner,

02:13.220 --> 02:15.787
but we think he might be
getting bullied at school.

02:15.831 --> 02:17.180
Well, the last thing
you want to do

02:17.224 --> 02:18.921
in that situation
is talk about it.Right.

02:18.964 --> 02:20.314
So I just figured
show him a couple moves.

02:20.357 --> 02:22.272
Maybe that'll help
open him up.

02:22.316 --> 02:24.840
Buddy of mine's got a karate gym
over in Chatsworth,

02:24.883 --> 02:26.798
if you want to give Matty
some more tools.

02:26.842 --> 02:29.192
Let's, uh, see how these lessons
go before I get to that.

02:29.236 --> 02:32.021
Just throwing it out there.
Think about it.

02:33.022 --> 02:35.938
All right, good.
That's it.

02:35.981 --> 02:37.461
Yup.

02:49.734 --> 02:51.388
MAN:
Hey, you hear that?

02:55.175 --> 02:57.046
[yells]

02:57.089 --> 03:00.789
[panting][banging on door]

03:00.832 --> 03:02.356
DISPATCHER:
911.

03:02.399 --> 03:04.314
Yeah, there's a...
a break-in at my work.

03:04.358 --> 03:05.663
The Gye Nyame Community Center.

03:05.707 --> 03:07.665
[panting]

03:07.709 --> 03:09.798
I'm barricaded in my office.

03:09.841 --> 03:11.495
I-I locked myself in.

03:11.539 --> 03:12.931
But they're trying to get in.The hell you doing?!

03:12.975 --> 03:14.324
She's got a purse.

03:14.368 --> 03:16.065
Means she also got a phone.

03:16.108 --> 03:17.806
[siren wailing]

03:17.849 --> 03:19.199
Yo, we got to go.

03:19.242 --> 03:20.896
Now!

03:46.835 --> 03:50.534
[rock music plays quietly]

03:51.535 --> 03:53.276
There you go. Enjoy.

03:54.930 --> 03:57.106
You better not be lying!

03:57.149 --> 03:59.543
If I find out you are...[groans]

03:59.587 --> 04:01.066
Hey, whoa, whoa, guys.

04:01.110 --> 04:02.720
You mind dialing it down
a couple notches, huh?

04:02.764 --> 04:05.332
Get lost.Hey, you first.

04:09.161 --> 04:12.208
Yeah. Yeah, I thought so.

04:12.948 --> 04:14.297
[people screaming]

04:17.344 --> 04:18.519
[gunfire]

04:18.562 --> 04:19.911
[groans]

04:19.955 --> 04:21.826
[gunfire continues]

04:26.483 --> 04:28.355
Baby.

04:28.398 --> 04:30.487
I came as soon as
I heard. Are you okay?

04:30.531 --> 04:32.054
[sighs]
Mm.

04:32.097 --> 04:33.925
Yeah, I think so.

04:33.969 --> 04:35.449
Wow.

04:36.928 --> 04:39.148
Did you get a look at
either of them?

04:39.191 --> 04:40.715
One of them.
I didn't recognize him.

04:40.758 --> 04:42.325
It's gonna be okay.

04:42.369 --> 04:43.413
I got patrols searching
the area as we speak.

04:43.457 --> 04:44.414
We will find them.

04:44.458 --> 04:46.329
I know.
It's just...

04:46.373 --> 04:47.635
I used to think
of this place

04:47.678 --> 04:49.506
as a kind of sanctuary,
you know?

04:49.550 --> 04:51.291
But I was defenseless

04:51.334 --> 04:53.205
as they were banging
on my office door.

04:53.249 --> 04:55.686
I mean, if they'd
gotten in...?

04:55.730 --> 04:58.167
It reminded me of
how Annie said she felt

04:58.210 --> 04:59.821
when their place was attacked.

04:59.864 --> 05:01.344
It's hard to
feel comfortable

05:01.388 --> 05:02.998
once your safe space
has been violated.Yeah.

05:03.041 --> 05:04.869
But Annie did
something about it.

05:04.913 --> 05:06.915
And now I understand why.

05:06.958 --> 05:08.482
She bought a gun,

05:08.525 --> 05:10.092
had Deacon train her
how to use it.

05:10.135 --> 05:12.007
Nichelle, I thought
you were pretty anti-gun?

05:12.050 --> 05:14.401
Up until this morning,
so did I.

05:14.444 --> 05:16.272
[phone beeping]

05:16.316 --> 05:18.361
[exhales]
Baby, I'm sorry.

05:18.405 --> 05:21.190
I know. It's okay.
We're all right.All right, I got a patrol unit

05:21.233 --> 05:22.626
staying here
the rest of the day,

05:22.670 --> 05:24.280
just in case. Now,
if you need anything,

05:24.324 --> 05:25.934
you call me. All right?Okay.

05:25.977 --> 05:27.936
I love you.

05:27.979 --> 05:29.372
I love you.

05:33.028 --> 05:35.030
[sighs]

05:35.987 --> 05:37.337
[siren wailing]

05:39.339 --> 05:41.297
[tires screeching]

05:41.341 --> 05:43.995
[helicopter whirring]

05:44.039 --> 05:46.084
Witnesses say
an attempted robbery

05:46.128 --> 05:48.696
of the Manila Meltdown food
truck resulted into a firefight

05:48.739 --> 05:50.959
between four armed suspects
and private security.

05:51.002 --> 05:53.048
One suspect took
a bullet in the leg,

05:53.091 --> 05:54.789
then barricaded himself
inside the truck.

05:54.832 --> 05:56.443
The other three fled.Any hostages?

05:56.486 --> 05:58.227
None that we can tell.

05:58.270 --> 05:59.402
We don't have eyes inside?

05:59.446 --> 06:00.490
A guy keeps popping off shots

06:00.534 --> 06:02.013
every time we try to approach.

06:02.057 --> 06:03.493
He's fired at least
ten rounds by now.

06:03.537 --> 06:04.973
We can't risk him firing off
too many more.

06:05.016 --> 06:06.757
Let's move.
Tan, grab the shield.

06:28.039 --> 06:29.998
Officer, move, move.

06:32.217 --> 06:34.045
This is Sergeant Harrelson
with LAPD SWAT!

06:34.089 --> 06:37.135
Step out of the vehicle
with your hands up.

06:37.179 --> 06:38.876
[gunfire]Cover.

06:40.487 --> 06:41.879
Street, Luca, prep tear gas.

06:41.923 --> 06:43.881
Move in and deploy when able.

06:43.925 --> 06:44.969
I'll keep his attention.

06:47.276 --> 06:49.887
You've got a choice
in how this ends, man.

06:49.931 --> 06:51.149
Be smart about it.

06:51.193 --> 06:52.977
You surrender peacefully,

06:53.021 --> 06:55.110
nobody gets hurt here.

06:56.241 --> 06:58.635
[grenade explodes, hisses]

06:58.679 --> 07:00.550
Tan...

07:00.594 --> 07:01.856
Move in.

07:03.205 --> 07:04.902
[coughing]

07:07.731 --> 07:09.603
HONDO:
Tan, non-lethal.

07:20.048 --> 07:21.832
Clear!STREET: 26-David.

07:21.876 --> 07:23.530
Truck is clear.

07:25.401 --> 07:27.098
No pulse.

07:28.535 --> 07:29.884
20-David to Command.

07:29.927 --> 07:32.930
One suspect down.
We're Code 4.

07:34.671 --> 07:37.457
Initial tally is four
critically wounded civilians,

07:37.500 --> 07:38.675
one dead security guard.

07:38.719 --> 07:40.677
And another
food truck robbed.

07:40.721 --> 07:42.157
This wasn't a one-off?Third truck

07:42.200 --> 07:44.028
in the last two hours,
according to RHD,

07:44.072 --> 07:46.161
and three of the suspects
are still in the wind.

07:46.204 --> 07:48.119
Well, I got Street and Cabrera
checking with festival security

07:48.163 --> 07:50.774
to see if anyone can ID
the other shooters.I hope someone did.

07:50.818 --> 07:52.994
I mean, this crew is getting
more brazen and violent

07:53.037 --> 07:55.213
each time they hit.Do you think this is
some kind of vendetta?

07:55.257 --> 07:56.824
I don't know, it's too soon
to tell, but I'm putting SWAT

07:56.867 --> 07:59.479
on high alert until we get
to the bottom of this.

07:59.522 --> 08:02.394
There are over 400 food trucks
on the streets of L.A.

08:02.438 --> 08:04.571
Any one of them could be
the next target.

08:04.614 --> 08:07.399
And more innocent civilians
will get caught in the crossfire

08:07.443 --> 08:09.793
if we don't step up
and stop it.

08:09.837 --> 08:11.795
â™ª

08:46.743 --> 08:48.832
Leticia, thank God. Is Xiamara--We're both okay.

08:48.876 --> 08:50.225
We hid inside the truck
when the shooting started.

08:50.268 --> 08:51.443
Is Adam okay?

08:51.487 --> 08:52.706
Adam?

08:52.749 --> 08:54.272
He's a friend.
You met him this morning.

08:54.316 --> 08:56.318
He got shot while
trying to help.Yeah.

08:56.361 --> 08:58.015
The wounded were rushed
to San Gabriel Hospital.

08:58.059 --> 08:59.321
TAN:
My brother, Jacob,
works over there.

08:59.364 --> 09:00.757
I'll ask him to check in
and report back.

09:00.801 --> 09:03.412
Adam's in good hands.Promise.

09:03.455 --> 09:04.718
Xiamara, look...

09:04.761 --> 09:07.547
[speaking Spanish]

09:10.332 --> 09:12.073
I think she's upset with you.

09:12.116 --> 09:13.596
Yeah, I kind of picked up
on that, thanks.

09:13.640 --> 09:15.250
LETICIA:
I tried talking to her,
like you asked.

09:15.293 --> 09:16.947
La tÃ­aonly agreed
to this job

09:19.341 --> 09:20.603
She says somewhere

09:20.647 --> 09:22.605
along the way,
that excitement disappeared.

09:22.649 --> 09:24.564
And so did you.

09:24.607 --> 09:27.915
If you're not invested anymore,
I think it's time tÃ­amoves on.

09:30.308 --> 09:32.484
And we'll let you know
I think when we hear about Adam.

09:33.660 --> 09:35.139
Promise.

09:35.183 --> 09:36.445
Okay?

09:44.018 --> 09:46.324
Just got off the phone
with Detective Burrows.

09:46.368 --> 09:48.805
The suspects didn't touch
the cash registers

09:48.849 --> 09:50.372
at any of the food trucks
they hit,

09:50.415 --> 09:52.809
so we're at square one
for potential motive.

09:52.853 --> 09:54.289
All right, you might have
something there.

09:54.332 --> 09:55.595
Look, the food truck scene
in L.A. is a lot more

09:55.638 --> 09:57.248
cutthroat than you'd think.

09:57.292 --> 09:59.424
There's all these rivalries
and disputes over territories.

09:59.468 --> 10:02.123
And those turn violent?Slashed tires,
bricks through windows,

10:02.166 --> 10:04.516
an occasional 4:00 a.m.
kitchen fire?

10:04.560 --> 10:05.953
The owner of Manila Meltdown
mentioned he had

10:05.996 --> 10:08.390
a longstanding beef
with Ernie Delgado.

10:08.433 --> 10:10.784
LUCA: Huh. Ernie Delgado.HICKS: You know him?

10:10.827 --> 10:12.307
LUCA:
Yeah, he calls himself

10:12.350 --> 10:14.222
"The Food Truck Don
of Los Angeles."

10:14.265 --> 10:16.224
Guy's got a big ego,
and an even bigger temper.

10:16.267 --> 10:17.834
CABRERA: These attacks
could be Delgado

10:17.878 --> 10:20.445
retaliating against other
trucks for encroaching

10:20.489 --> 10:21.925
on his territory.

10:21.969 --> 10:24.319
Let's bring him in,
see what he coughs up.

10:25.712 --> 10:27.452
Hey.

10:27.496 --> 10:29.237
We've got a BOLO out
on the suspects' SUV,

10:29.280 --> 10:30.586
and Luca's running down
a new lead.

10:30.630 --> 10:32.109
As soon as we find
something, we roll out.

10:33.415 --> 10:35.896
Hey, heard about the break-in
at the community center.

10:35.939 --> 10:37.332
Nichelle doing okay?

10:37.375 --> 10:40.335
Yeah, yeah. It spooked her
pretty good though.

10:40.378 --> 10:42.859
But, Deacon, she's talking about
getting a gun for protection.

10:42.903 --> 10:44.556
She said something about Annie
doing the same thing?

10:44.600 --> 10:46.210
Yeah, she did.

10:46.254 --> 10:48.865
When our house got shot up.
But she loves it now.

10:48.909 --> 10:51.346
She's at the range
twice a month.

10:51.389 --> 10:53.783
Does it make her
feel better? Safer?I think so.

10:53.827 --> 10:56.699
What scares me is the thought of
her actually having to use it.

10:56.743 --> 10:58.658
See? You just nailed
what's been bugging me.

10:58.701 --> 11:00.834
Look, I ain't got no issues
with guns, obviously,

11:00.877 --> 11:02.574
but ever since
Nichelle brought it up,

11:02.618 --> 11:04.011
all I can think about is

11:04.054 --> 11:05.621
all the different ways
things could go sideways.

11:05.665 --> 11:07.101
Yeah.
I mean, I don't know.

11:07.144 --> 11:08.711
I mean, I guess the mental
calculus changes

11:08.755 --> 11:10.191
when it's somebody
you love, right?

11:10.234 --> 11:11.496
Wait until
your kid is born.

11:11.540 --> 11:12.759
The phrase "worst
case scenario"

11:12.802 --> 11:14.586
takes on a whole
new meaning.

11:14.630 --> 11:16.327
Hey, speaking of which, I heard
Matthew got in a little scuffle.

11:16.371 --> 11:18.982
Got suspended.
Is he all right?Yeah, yeah. He's fine.

11:19.026 --> 11:21.637
Some bully just, you know,
beat on him a little bit.

11:21.681 --> 11:23.334
I showed him a couple
combinations.

11:23.378 --> 11:24.814
In case it happens again,
he'll be able to at least

11:24.858 --> 11:26.468
defend himself.
Attaboy.[phone chimes]

11:28.209 --> 11:29.863
[groans]
Oh, boy.

11:30.994 --> 11:32.996
What's up?It's Annie.

11:33.040 --> 11:35.956
Apparently, one of the mothers
from Matthew's classroom,

11:35.999 --> 11:38.001
she came by and she's accusing
Matthew of starting the fight.

11:38.045 --> 11:39.742
[chuckles] Okay, wait a minute,
are you sure about that?

11:39.786 --> 11:41.222
I mean, no offense,

11:41.265 --> 11:42.702
but Matthew's more of a
bean pole than a boxer.

11:43.703 --> 11:45.052
Uh-oh.

11:45.095 --> 11:46.880
That's the other kid?Yeah.

11:46.923 --> 11:48.359
Looks pretty definitive.

11:48.403 --> 11:51.058
Maybe you should ease up
on those boxing lessons.

11:55.584 --> 11:56.933
Just talked to
my brother.

11:56.977 --> 11:58.152
He said it looks like
Leticia's friend, Adam,

11:58.195 --> 11:59.501
will pull through.Oh, awesome.

11:59.544 --> 12:01.242
All right.
I'll let her know.

12:01.285 --> 12:02.939
Hey, hold up.

12:02.983 --> 12:04.767
Things looked a little tense
with you and Xiamara earlier.

12:04.811 --> 12:06.769
Everything all right
with the food truck?

12:06.813 --> 12:08.118
Yeah, course.
Why?

12:08.162 --> 12:10.120
Well, the team and I
do own a stake in it.

12:10.164 --> 12:11.600
But I'm asking
as a friend.

12:11.643 --> 12:13.820
Truth is, Leticia's
kind of right.

12:13.863 --> 12:16.779
I'm not as excited about
Guate-Mama's anymore.What happened?

12:16.823 --> 12:18.520
I thought business
was booming.It is.

12:18.563 --> 12:19.826
It's been than ever,
honestly.

12:19.869 --> 12:21.653
It's just...
we do need more help.

12:21.697 --> 12:23.090
I just haven't made the time.

12:23.133 --> 12:25.048
Look, I bought the food truck

12:25.092 --> 12:27.050
because I thought it would
bring the team together,

12:27.094 --> 12:28.660
you know,
keep us all connected.

12:28.704 --> 12:30.750
But now that
Chris is gone,

12:30.793 --> 12:32.447
and, I don't know,
everyone seems

12:32.490 --> 12:35.755
preoccupied with their own
lives and relationships...

12:35.798 --> 12:37.844
it feels like I failed.

12:37.887 --> 12:40.020
And that truck is just
a reminder of that failure.

12:40.063 --> 12:42.500
Hey, Guate-Mama's
isn't a failure.

12:42.544 --> 12:46.069
But I do think you put some
unrealistic expectations on it.

12:46.113 --> 12:47.767
What do you mean?My man,
you see the world

12:47.810 --> 12:49.333
through SWAT-colored glasses.

12:49.377 --> 12:51.335
We all want SWAT to last
forever, but we know it can't.

12:51.379 --> 12:53.033
Maybe it's time
you start thinking about

12:53.076 --> 12:54.643
what'll really make you
happy in the long term.

12:54.686 --> 12:56.471
I thought the food truck
would help with that,

12:56.514 --> 12:57.733
you know?Yeah.

12:57.777 --> 12:59.126
You remember
how excited you were

12:59.169 --> 13:00.388
the first time we all
tried Xiamara's cooking?

13:00.431 --> 13:01.868
Yeah.
Yeah.

13:01.911 --> 13:04.261
I know you get that same
excited look on your face

13:04.305 --> 13:05.741
every time a new customer
comes up to the truck.

13:05.785 --> 13:07.134
I've seen it.

13:07.177 --> 13:08.962
Maybe don't give up
on the dream just yet.

13:09.005 --> 13:10.702
[phone chimes]

13:12.748 --> 13:14.315
All right.

13:14.358 --> 13:15.795
Food Truck Don
just landed.

13:15.838 --> 13:17.492
Let's go.

13:20.408 --> 13:22.236
Ernie Delgado?

13:22.279 --> 13:23.846
This about
the food trucks

13:23.890 --> 13:25.935
that got attacked today?LUCA:
Good guess.

13:25.979 --> 13:27.241
What do you know about them?

13:27.284 --> 13:29.069
Just that the people
who got attacked

13:29.112 --> 13:30.853
crossed the wrong dude.

13:30.897 --> 13:32.246
Wrong dude being you?Is this your way of

13:32.289 --> 13:33.900
getting the competition
to back off your turf?

13:33.943 --> 13:36.424
Hey.
[chuckles]

13:36.467 --> 13:38.252
That is not
how I do business.

13:38.295 --> 13:39.557
You don't get the nickname

13:39.601 --> 13:41.255
"Food Truck Don of L.A."
by playing nice.

13:41.298 --> 13:45.346
Look, I'll admit to using
some intimidation tactics

13:45.389 --> 13:47.609
to keep my trucks
on the best corners.

13:47.652 --> 13:50.351
But I draw the line
at hurting people.

13:50.394 --> 13:52.875
So whoever's behind
these attacks...

13:52.919 --> 13:55.008
they go by a different
set of rules.

13:55.051 --> 13:58.576
And besides, I would never go
after my own flesh and blood.

13:58.620 --> 14:00.404
Oh, so you're saying
someone from your family

14:00.448 --> 14:01.884
got hit by this crew?

14:01.928 --> 14:05.105
Yeah, my cousin Mikey's
spot in Hollywood.

14:05.148 --> 14:07.237
What's the name of
his food truck?It's not a truck.

14:07.281 --> 14:09.152
He owns a restaurant
called Don Viva's.

14:09.196 --> 14:11.154
And the mole is...
it's amazing.

14:11.198 --> 14:13.200
Ernie, focus.

14:13.243 --> 14:15.158
The crew
at the restaurant.

14:15.202 --> 14:18.074
Mikey said that the gunmen only
took a couple of boxes of food.

14:18.118 --> 14:20.076
Didn't touch
the cash register,

14:20.120 --> 14:21.904
didn't even go
after the office safe.

14:21.948 --> 14:23.384
So it's not just
food trucks.[phone chimes]

14:23.427 --> 14:26.648
These guys must be after
something specific.

14:28.911 --> 14:30.913
Black SUV matching the
suspects' getaway vehicle

14:30.957 --> 14:33.176
just spotted
near Glassell Park.

14:33.220 --> 14:34.656
[tires screeching]

14:36.614 --> 14:38.007
Out.

14:38.051 --> 14:39.791
Now.

14:41.271 --> 14:43.099
Open up the back.It's unlocked.

14:45.493 --> 14:48.322
Take anything you want,
just don't shoot. Please.

14:54.284 --> 14:56.330
[siren wailing]

15:11.867 --> 15:13.216
LUCA:
Hey, you guys follow the rabbit.

15:13.260 --> 15:14.696
We've got the SUV!

15:19.092 --> 15:20.702
On it!

15:24.445 --> 15:26.490
[siren wailing]

15:28.884 --> 15:31.626
It's too tight.
Got to hoof it.

15:31.669 --> 15:33.758
30-David. In foot pursuit,
southbound in an alley.

15:33.802 --> 15:35.847
Just off San Fernando.

15:40.287 --> 15:42.811
[groans]

15:42.854 --> 15:45.205
Give me your hands
behind your back!DEACON: 30-David.

15:45.248 --> 15:46.771
One suspect in custody.

15:46.815 --> 15:49.296
Tan, what's your status?TAN:
25-David.

15:49.339 --> 15:51.951
Suspect's heading east
on Avenue 35.

15:51.994 --> 15:53.430
We're in pursuit.

15:54.649 --> 15:55.998
[tires screeching]

16:06.356 --> 16:07.662
[tires screeching]

16:21.763 --> 16:23.243
LUCA:
Okay, I'm gonna try
a pit maneuver.

16:23.286 --> 16:24.896
That truck's twice
the size of this Charger.

16:24.940 --> 16:26.072
You got a better idea?

16:34.210 --> 16:35.385
Luca, swerve!

16:41.348 --> 16:42.697
[grunts]

16:42.740 --> 16:44.046
22-David. We lost sight
of the suspects.

16:44.090 --> 16:45.874
Last seen heading
south on Central.

16:45.917 --> 16:48.746
Was that a freaking grenade?Sure as hell
wasn't a speed bump.

16:48.790 --> 16:51.140
Something tells me these
aren't your everyday crooks.

16:53.055 --> 16:56.363
Deac, truck driver says
they cut him off,

16:56.406 --> 16:57.755
then grabbed boxes
from the back.

16:57.799 --> 16:59.061
DEACON:
We know they're not after money,

16:59.105 --> 17:00.845
but all this carnage
for some produce?

17:00.889 --> 17:02.108
Looks like they were
after avocados.

17:03.326 --> 17:04.588
DEACON:
Wait a second.

17:05.633 --> 17:07.330
There's more going on here.

17:10.899 --> 17:12.248
Now we know why.

17:12.292 --> 17:14.903
These avocados are packed
with cocaine.

17:21.127 --> 17:22.737
I've heard of drugs being
transported in gas tanks,

17:22.780 --> 17:25.174
children's toys, even
live animals and people.

17:25.218 --> 17:26.958
But this one
takes the cake.

17:27.002 --> 17:29.352
I mean, how the hell did they
even get the drugs inside there

17:29.396 --> 17:30.832
and still
make it look seamless?

17:30.875 --> 17:32.355
I don't know,
whatever magic they used,

17:32.399 --> 17:34.009
there's no clear difference
between one of these

17:34.053 --> 17:35.837
and your average avocado
at the local grocery store.

17:35.880 --> 17:37.099
Except the eight ball
that falls out

17:37.143 --> 17:38.796
as you're prepping
dinner.Yeah.

17:38.840 --> 17:40.537
I mean, packaging drugs like
this makes it near impossible

17:40.581 --> 17:42.278
to intercept them
during transport.

17:42.322 --> 17:44.237
Something this sophisticated
and methodical,

17:44.280 --> 17:45.629
it's got to be a cartel.

17:45.673 --> 17:47.501
Consider that confirmed.

17:47.544 --> 17:49.155
Just got a positive ID
on our food truck shooter

17:49.198 --> 17:51.418
from this morning.
Ramon Garza.

17:51.461 --> 17:55.248
He's a suspected hit man
for the Baja Renegados Cartel.

17:55.291 --> 17:56.727
The suspect
we just arrested

17:56.771 --> 17:59.339
is Manny Leyva,
another cartel hit man.

17:59.382 --> 18:02.429
Along with...Peter Medina
and Felix Soto.

18:02.472 --> 18:05.214
Together, better known as
the Four Horsemen.

18:05.258 --> 18:06.781
Yeah, they're
a cartel hit squad

18:06.824 --> 18:08.522
suspected in over
a dozen murders

18:08.565 --> 18:09.958
throughout
Southern California.

18:10.001 --> 18:11.655
Along with countless others
across the border.

18:11.699 --> 18:13.309
I mean, this crew is vicious.

18:13.353 --> 18:14.919
One of them is notorious
for using hand grenades

18:14.963 --> 18:16.356
to carry out his hits.

18:16.399 --> 18:18.053
Yeah, I caught his
matinee show earlier with Tan.

18:18.097 --> 18:20.011
Definitely plan on
skipping the encore.

18:20.055 --> 18:22.797
If the Four Horsemen are
chasing down these drugs,

18:22.840 --> 18:24.929
we might've interrupted
a cartel turf war.

18:24.973 --> 18:26.714
Well, we won't know for sure
until we figure out

18:26.757 --> 18:28.324
where these avocados
came from.

18:28.368 --> 18:29.934
[sighs]

18:31.022 --> 18:32.981
I had no idea there were
drugs in them.

18:33.024 --> 18:35.114
I was just making my
usual deliveries.

18:35.157 --> 18:36.332
Deliveries for who?

18:36.376 --> 18:38.465
My job. Kedzie Produce.

18:38.508 --> 18:41.424
That some kind of
cartel front?Cartel?

18:41.468 --> 18:42.686
No way.

18:42.730 --> 18:44.253
Kedzie's a legit
produce company.

18:44.297 --> 18:46.168
We supply to customers
all over the city.

18:46.212 --> 18:47.169
Restaurants,

18:47.213 --> 18:49.258
grocery stores,
food trucks,

18:49.302 --> 18:51.826
you name it.Does that include a food truck
called Manila Meltdown?

18:51.869 --> 18:53.349
Or Don Viva restaurant,
in Hollywood?

18:53.393 --> 18:55.264
Delivered to both of them
this morning.

18:55.308 --> 18:58.180
I bet Kedzie Produce supplies
to all the businesses

18:58.224 --> 18:59.660
the Four Horsemen hit.

18:59.703 --> 19:00.748
If Kedzie's the source
of the avocados...

19:00.791 --> 19:02.663
They could be a target, too.

19:05.753 --> 19:08.190
It's right down here.

19:08.234 --> 19:10.584
Patrol really caught the guys
who broke in this morning?

19:10.627 --> 19:12.194
I sure as hell hope so.

19:12.238 --> 19:14.153
You're the only one
who can tell us for sure.

19:14.196 --> 19:16.416
You said you got a good look
at one of them, right?Mm-hmm.

19:16.459 --> 19:17.721
Okay.

19:21.856 --> 19:23.684
HONDO:
Suspects are being
brought in as we speak.

19:25.686 --> 19:28.689
I've been mulling it
over all day,

19:28.732 --> 19:33.172
and I think I do
want to get a gun.

19:33.215 --> 19:35.783
Are you sure?All I could think
about this morning

19:35.826 --> 19:38.742
was the need to protect
myself and our baby.

19:38.786 --> 19:41.789
Maybe a gun will make me
feel safer, more in control.

19:41.832 --> 19:43.225
In the right hands,

19:43.269 --> 19:46.315
with the right training,
guns do save lives.

19:46.359 --> 19:48.970
But it comes with
a lot of risk, Nichelle,

19:49.013 --> 19:50.667
especially
in homes with kids.

19:50.711 --> 19:52.539
Children in homes with guns

19:52.582 --> 19:54.454
are three times more likely to
die from accidental shooting.

19:54.497 --> 19:57.631
And even more likely to be
seriously injured, I know.

19:57.674 --> 19:59.937
That's why I never wanted one
at the community center.

19:59.981 --> 20:02.418
But at the same time,
I don't want to feel scared

20:02.462 --> 20:04.159
in my own workplace.

20:05.987 --> 20:07.206
Here they come.

20:12.080 --> 20:13.864
I know him.

20:13.908 --> 20:15.736
On the right.
Damiere.

20:15.779 --> 20:17.651
Are these the kids
that broke in?

20:19.305 --> 20:20.741
Yeah, that's them.

20:22.830 --> 20:24.658
Take them to booking.

20:27.226 --> 20:29.445
How do you know
this kid?[sighs]

20:29.489 --> 20:33.406
Damiere used to come around
the center once in a while.

20:33.449 --> 20:35.277
One of those kids that
never got a fair shot

20:35.321 --> 20:37.410
at living
up to his potential.Hey.

20:37.453 --> 20:39.847
I really hope you're not
blaming yourself for this.

20:39.890 --> 20:42.371
That kid made a choice.Yeah.

20:42.415 --> 20:44.460
You're right.

20:45.983 --> 20:48.072
We just got off with
Agent Simons

20:48.116 --> 20:49.509
over at the DEA.

20:49.552 --> 20:51.206
Now, their working theory

20:51.250 --> 20:53.513
is that these avocados
are tied to a DEA raid

20:53.556 --> 20:56.429
on a Baja Renegados
shipping depot in Mexico.

20:56.472 --> 20:58.082
Now, the raid
went down last week,

20:58.126 --> 21:00.998
but the DEA came up
mostly empty.Let me guess.

21:01.042 --> 21:03.305
Cartel got tipped off and had to
move their drugs in a hurry?

21:03.349 --> 21:04.524
DEACON:
Exactly. But in the chaos,

21:04.567 --> 21:06.395
this batch of avocados
somehow fell

21:06.439 --> 21:08.789
outside the cartel's
normal smuggling route.

21:08.832 --> 21:10.399
DEA thinks there's over
five million bucks

21:10.443 --> 21:13.054
worth of cocaine avocados
in that missing shipment.

21:13.097 --> 21:15.448
That explains why they sent
their best hired guns

21:15.491 --> 21:17.493
to track it down.BURROWS:
And also explains

21:17.537 --> 21:18.929
how the drugs ended up
at a reputable business

21:18.973 --> 21:20.714
like Kedzie Produce.

21:20.757 --> 21:22.281
The place hasn't had so much
as a health violation in years.

21:22.324 --> 21:24.587
If the Four Horsemen knew
to target Bechir's truck,

21:24.631 --> 21:26.372
then they had to know
about the produce supplier.

21:26.415 --> 21:28.199
They knew, all right.

21:28.243 --> 21:30.593
Rocker's team just cleared
the Kedzie Produce warehouse.

21:30.637 --> 21:32.029
It was a bloodbath.

21:32.073 --> 21:33.553
Did they leave
any survivors?

21:33.596 --> 21:35.250
Only one.

21:35.294 --> 21:37.818
An administrator named
Sabrina Furley.

21:37.861 --> 21:39.820
She's conscious
and at the hospital now.

21:39.863 --> 21:41.169
On my way.

21:45.434 --> 21:47.001
Sabrina Furley?

21:48.045 --> 21:51.484
I'm Sergeant Kay, LAPD SWAT.
This is Officer Cabrera.

21:51.527 --> 21:53.050
We hate to do this.

21:53.094 --> 21:54.878
We-we were hoping you
could answer a few questions.

21:54.922 --> 21:57.185
We're looking for the people
who did this to you.

21:57.228 --> 21:59.666
DEACON:
It was four men, right?

21:59.709 --> 22:02.059
When they first came, yes.

22:02.103 --> 22:04.540
They came to Kedzie Produce
more than once?

22:06.368 --> 22:08.022
The first time they came,

22:08.065 --> 22:11.417
they demanded that we give them
all the avocados we had.

22:11.460 --> 22:13.070
They threatened us,

22:13.114 --> 22:14.768
so we gave them
what they wanted.

22:14.811 --> 22:17.466
Then later,
they came back...

22:19.033 --> 22:21.383
They started killing
the moment they got inside.

22:21.427 --> 22:25.779
Shooting everyone
multiple times.

22:25.822 --> 22:28.303
Saying that we'd
double-crossed them,

22:28.347 --> 22:30.218
and we had to pay.

22:30.261 --> 22:31.567
When I tried to run,

22:31.611 --> 22:33.134
they shot me in the back.

22:34.570 --> 22:35.745
They would've killed me

22:35.789 --> 22:37.138
if Eddie hadn't
lured them away.

22:37.181 --> 22:39.401
Eddie?SABRINA:
Our warehouse manager.

22:39.445 --> 22:41.098
He saved me.

22:42.143 --> 22:44.450
He tried to talk
the gunmen down,

22:44.493 --> 22:46.843
but they tied him up,

22:46.887 --> 22:49.977
put a grenade
in his pocket...

22:50.020 --> 22:51.979
[crying]DEACON:
Sabrina...

22:52.022 --> 22:54.068
[exhales]
Do you know why they came back?

22:54.111 --> 22:56.418
What they meant when they said
you double-crossed them?

22:56.462 --> 22:58.551
Only that they said

22:58.594 --> 23:01.684
that ten crates of their
avocados were still missing.

23:01.728 --> 23:03.686
Wait, that truck
hijacking earlier...

23:03.730 --> 23:05.253
The delivery log said

23:05.296 --> 23:06.776
that there were
five crates of avocados

23:06.820 --> 23:09.126
which means that there's
five crates unaccounted for.

23:09.170 --> 23:11.433
If those aren't
at Kedzie Produce

23:11.477 --> 23:13.479
and the cartel hasn't
found them yet...

23:13.522 --> 23:15.742
where are they?Benny must've taken them.

23:15.785 --> 23:18.266
He was still out
on his route.

23:18.309 --> 23:20.050
â™ª

23:21.487 --> 23:24.054
Tell me we found something
on this Benny character.

23:24.098 --> 23:25.621
Yeah, that Benny
is Benny Rizzo.

23:25.665 --> 23:27.797
Delivery driver
for Kedzie Produce.

23:27.841 --> 23:29.364
I ran through
the company records.

23:29.408 --> 23:30.931
Seems Benny runs
a little side hustle,

23:30.974 --> 23:32.889
skimming produce
from the Kedzie warehouse.

23:32.933 --> 23:35.152
He writes items off
as damaged or rotten,

23:35.196 --> 23:36.806
then sells the stolen
goods on the side.

23:36.850 --> 23:38.242
Given the amount of produce

23:38.286 --> 23:40.549
that moves through Kedzie,
it's no surprise

23:40.593 --> 23:41.898
Benny's grift
has gone unnoticed.

23:41.942 --> 23:43.726
If Benny unknowingly
took those five crates

23:43.770 --> 23:45.946
of coke-filled avocados...He's got to be next up

23:45.989 --> 23:47.556
on the cartel's hit list.Exactly.

23:47.600 --> 23:49.515
Find him ASAP.

23:51.734 --> 23:54.302
[sportscast playing
indistinctly]

23:55.999 --> 23:58.567
Take whatever you want!
Just-just don't hurt me.

24:03.224 --> 24:04.443
[groans]

24:06.445 --> 24:07.576
We're not gonna hurt you.

24:10.971 --> 24:13.277
You're gonna show us where
you took our avocados,

24:13.321 --> 24:15.541
and then we're
gonna kill you.

24:22.243 --> 24:23.940
Patrol found signs of forced
entry at Benny Rizzo's place,

24:23.984 --> 24:25.333
and he's nowhere
to be seen.Cartel beat us there.

24:25.376 --> 24:27.335
They would've executed
Benny on the spot

24:27.378 --> 24:29.076
if they got
their drugs back.

24:29.119 --> 24:30.991
Benny must've already
offloaded the avocados

24:31.034 --> 24:32.166
as part of his
side hustle.

24:32.209 --> 24:33.515
Wherever
those avocados are,

24:33.559 --> 24:35.299
that's where the cartel
will be next.

24:35.343 --> 24:37.258
Think we might know a way to
figure out where they're headed.

24:37.301 --> 24:40.435
Tan?This is Benny Rizzo's delivery
route for Kedzie Produce.

24:40.479 --> 24:42.524
He makes the same
eight stops every day.

24:42.568 --> 24:46.136
But none of these eight places
received any avocados today.

24:46.180 --> 24:47.964
So I looked into Benny's
cell phone records.

24:48.008 --> 24:50.184
Based off his
location data,

24:50.227 --> 24:51.533
Benny makes
regular deviations

24:51.577 --> 24:53.187
from his scheduled
delivery route

24:53.230 --> 24:55.102
and always to the
same three places.

24:55.145 --> 24:57.365
Three off-the-books customers
he sells his stolen produce to.

24:57.408 --> 24:58.801
Exactly.
By the looks of it,

24:58.845 --> 25:00.411
an Indian restaurant,
barbecue place,

25:00.455 --> 25:02.239
mom-and-pop
grocery store.

25:02.283 --> 25:04.372
The barbecue shop is closed
for two weeks for renovations,

25:04.415 --> 25:06.287
so they definitely
didn't take a delivery.

25:06.330 --> 25:08.245
I can't say I've ever had
avocado with my curry and naan,

25:08.289 --> 25:09.638
so...I'll alert Patrol.

25:09.682 --> 25:11.466
Get over to Fields
Market in Van Nuys.

25:21.607 --> 25:23.391
[turns off engine]

25:24.392 --> 25:25.959
I need the money, Mom.

25:26.002 --> 25:27.264
You sure you don't want
me to come in with you?

25:27.308 --> 25:29.266
It's just orange juice
and eggs.

25:29.310 --> 25:30.267
I got it.

25:30.311 --> 25:31.399
[chuckles]
Okay.

25:31.442 --> 25:33.227
Remember, cage-free eggs...

25:33.270 --> 25:35.098
And no pulp in the OJ.
I know.

25:35.142 --> 25:36.360
[chuckles]

25:45.239 --> 25:46.632
Where are they?

25:46.675 --> 25:47.894
They're probably on the shelves
by now.

25:47.937 --> 25:49.069
L-Let me go
and talk to my guy

25:49.112 --> 25:50.244

31:20.835 --> 31:22.793
Let's just take a second
and talk about this.

31:22.837 --> 31:25.100
My bosses want
these avocados back ASAP.

31:25.144 --> 31:26.101
So...

31:26.145 --> 31:28.321
rain check
on that talk.

31:28.364 --> 31:30.453
Walk![crying]

31:32.499 --> 31:34.196
Come on.

31:35.981 --> 31:37.939
20-David to Command,
hold your fire.

31:37.983 --> 31:40.594
Clear a path
at the entrance.

31:43.379 --> 31:47.079
STREET:
Be advised, suspect has
a hostage with a live grenade.

31:47.122 --> 31:48.950
TAN:
Looks like an M67.

31:48.994 --> 31:52.519
Hey. M67's got a
five-second fuse, right?

31:53.781 --> 31:55.087
I got an idea.

31:55.130 --> 31:56.827
[Dax crying]

31:56.871 --> 31:58.655
[sniffles, crying]

31:58.699 --> 31:59.656
DEACON:
Hey, Dax?

31:59.700 --> 32:01.571
You hang in there, buddy.

32:01.615 --> 32:03.573
We're gonna
get you out of this.

32:03.617 --> 32:05.532
[Dax crying]

32:05.575 --> 32:07.403
HONDO:
Hey, Dax,
you a baseball fan?

32:07.447 --> 32:08.796
All right,
I'm gonna need you

32:08.839 --> 32:10.145
to keep a nice tight grip
on that ball,

32:10.189 --> 32:11.581
just like pitchers do
on the mound.

32:11.625 --> 32:12.843
You know
what I'm saying?Quit stalling

32:12.887 --> 32:14.149
and move!LUCA:
22-David,

32:14.193 --> 32:15.803
we got a place
to put that grenade.

32:15.846 --> 32:17.848
Side door. Dumpster. 12 o'clock.

32:17.892 --> 32:19.763
26-David, as soon as Felix
reaches the end of the aisle,

32:19.807 --> 32:21.504
we'll engage.

32:21.548 --> 32:22.897
Give us a signal
if it's a no-go.

32:22.941 --> 32:25.117
[crying]

32:26.770 --> 32:28.337
[gunshots]

32:32.689 --> 32:35.170
â™ª

32:43.918 --> 32:45.615
TAN:
Nice toss, boss.

32:45.659 --> 32:48.053
You guys could've put that
thing a couple feet closer.

32:48.096 --> 32:49.489
Wanted to make sure
you still had that fastball.

32:49.532 --> 32:51.839
I ain't dead yet, man.
[chuckles]

32:51.882 --> 32:54.668
â™ª

33:04.678 --> 33:06.071
[whispers]:
Hey, Xiamara. Xiamara.

33:07.855 --> 33:09.900
[monitor beeping steadily]

33:12.555 --> 33:14.514
Hey. I heard you gals
might be here.

33:14.557 --> 33:15.602
How's Adam?

33:15.645 --> 33:17.299
Okay. Recovering.

33:17.343 --> 33:18.735
Good.
I'm sorry

33:18.779 --> 33:20.563
I haven't been around
to help out.

33:20.607 --> 33:23.392
That I haven't seemed as excited
or invested in Guate-Mama's.

33:23.436 --> 33:24.480
I-I don't

33:24.524 --> 33:26.569
have a good excuse
why. But...

33:26.613 --> 33:29.050
I promise you, it's gonna
be different from now on.

33:29.094 --> 33:30.051
How different?

33:30.095 --> 33:31.226
Well,
for starters...

33:31.270 --> 33:32.271
Everything okay?

33:32.314 --> 33:34.099
For starters,

33:34.142 --> 33:35.709
Leticia's getting a promotion.

33:35.752 --> 33:37.493
Come again?General manager

33:37.537 --> 33:38.581
of Guate-Mama's.

33:38.625 --> 33:40.279
If-if-if Tia's okay with that.

33:40.322 --> 33:42.324
And we're gonna hire another
staff member to work the truck,

33:42.368 --> 33:43.586
to give you some rest.

33:43.630 --> 33:45.066
I'm gonna be around
to help more,

33:45.110 --> 33:46.633
starting right now.

33:46.676 --> 33:47.982
I booked us an event tonight.

33:48.026 --> 33:50.463
Food Truck Fridays. Studio City.

33:50.506 --> 33:52.160
I'm very tired...I know,
I know, I know.

33:52.204 --> 33:53.901
That's why I brought some help.
Yo, Tan.

33:53.944 --> 33:56.991
Tan's gonna be our new staff
member, help us out tonight.

33:57.035 --> 33:59.298
I'll take orders, serve food,
chat up customers,

33:59.341 --> 34:01.082
take out the trash--
whatever makes your life easier.

34:01.126 --> 34:03.693
Leticia, you can stay here
with Adam. We just need you

34:03.737 --> 34:06.174
to boss us around,
tell us what to do.

34:06.218 --> 34:09.264
But, more importantly, whatever
we make in sales this week,

34:09.308 --> 34:11.310
we're gonna put
towards Adam's hospital bill.

34:13.094 --> 34:16.271
Tan reminded me why I fell
in love with Guate-Mama's

34:16.315 --> 34:17.620
in the first place.

34:17.664 --> 34:19.274
I mean, your food
brings people happiness,

34:19.318 --> 34:21.276
Xiamara.

34:21.320 --> 34:24.453
I want to spread that happiness
as far and wide as we can.

34:25.454 --> 34:26.412
What do you say?

34:26.455 --> 34:27.935
That's the Luca I know.

34:27.978 --> 34:30.111
Then let's do this! Yes![laughing]

34:30.155 --> 34:31.765
[laughs]Let's do this then.

34:31.808 --> 34:33.375
Come on. Let's grab your things.
We'll say hi to Adam.

34:33.419 --> 34:36.161
I hear you call dibs
on trash duty?Yeah.

34:45.474 --> 34:46.649
We need to talk.

34:46.693 --> 34:48.086
Oh, if it's about Geoff,

34:48.129 --> 34:49.391
Mom already talked to me.Yeah,

34:49.435 --> 34:50.784
well, it's my turn.

34:55.919 --> 34:58.052
Did you instigate the fight
with Geoff today?

34:59.923 --> 35:01.447
[exhales]

35:04.493 --> 35:06.147
[sighs]
You know,

35:06.191 --> 35:08.758
to say that I am disappointed,

35:08.802 --> 35:10.325
that would be
an understatement.

35:11.283 --> 35:13.676
What you did to Geoff today,

35:13.720 --> 35:16.331
I have put handcuffs
on people for less.

35:16.375 --> 35:18.681
Do you understand me?
That is assault, Matty.

35:18.725 --> 35:21.423
We raised you to solve your
problems with words, not fists.

35:21.467 --> 35:22.903
What on earth
possessed you to do that?

35:22.946 --> 35:23.991
He called you a killer.

35:25.297 --> 35:27.125
Geoff said all cops are killers
and that, since you're SWAT,

35:27.168 --> 35:28.691
you're the worst kind of killer.

35:28.735 --> 35:30.040
I asked himto stop.

35:30.084 --> 35:33.000
I-I told him to shut
up, but he wouldn't.

35:33.043 --> 35:34.567
He just...

35:36.090 --> 35:39.441
He just kept saying that
you were a killer and that...

35:39.485 --> 35:41.704
we deserved to have
our house shot up.

35:43.097 --> 35:44.359
Next thingI knew,

35:44.403 --> 35:46.100
I was on top of him,
throwing punches.

35:47.057 --> 35:48.972
I didn't mean to...

35:49.016 --> 35:51.540
hurt him that badly,
I guess. I just...

35:53.629 --> 35:56.328
I just... [sighs]
wanted him to stop.

35:58.808 --> 36:00.680
Why didn't you
tell me the truth?

36:02.029 --> 36:03.378
Or your mother?

36:04.727 --> 36:06.294
You lied to us.

36:06.338 --> 36:09.036
You let us believe that you were
the victim in all this.

36:09.079 --> 36:10.907
I'm sorry, Dad.

36:11.865 --> 36:12.909
[sighs]

36:14.607 --> 36:17.087
What Geoff said...

36:17.131 --> 36:19.002
that wasn't right.

36:19.046 --> 36:21.004
And...

36:21.048 --> 36:24.312
[sighs]
I appreciate you...

36:24.356 --> 36:25.531
standing up for me.

36:25.574 --> 36:27.054
I do.

36:29.143 --> 36:30.405
But...
[stammers]

36:30.449 --> 36:32.059
just because somebody
said something

36:32.102 --> 36:33.408
that you
don't agree with,

36:33.452 --> 36:34.496
it doesn't give you
the right to hurt them.

36:34.540 --> 36:36.324
I know.

36:36.368 --> 36:40.894
I spent the day chasing
four very cruel, violent men.

36:41.938 --> 36:43.984
They caused a lot
of suffering.

36:45.464 --> 36:48.118
Now, did part of me want them
to suffer in return?

36:49.511 --> 36:51.731
Sure.
A little bit.

36:51.774 --> 36:52.862
But...

36:53.863 --> 36:55.778
...the Gospel of Matthew.

36:56.736 --> 36:59.042
Jesus reminds us...

36:59.086 --> 37:01.175
we got to love everybody.

37:01.219 --> 37:02.742
Even our enemies.

37:02.785 --> 37:05.353
And I know that that's gonna
be hard sometimes, but...

37:05.397 --> 37:06.920
[exhales]

37:06.963 --> 37:09.923
...there's always gonna be
someone that says or does

37:09.966 --> 37:12.186
something stupid or hateful.

37:13.318 --> 37:14.928
But a good person...

37:15.972 --> 37:18.366
...they don't respond
with violence.

37:18.410 --> 37:19.541
You can't let
other people's words

37:19.585 --> 37:21.282
dictate
your own actions, Matty.

37:22.718 --> 37:25.721
I'm-I'm sorry I let
you and Mom down.

37:26.896 --> 37:28.594
And...

37:28.637 --> 37:32.032
even more sorry for
what I did to Geoff.

37:35.209 --> 37:37.733
So, uh...

37:37.777 --> 37:39.735
what should happen next?

37:39.779 --> 37:41.433
I need to apologize to Geoff.

37:43.086 --> 37:44.827
And his family.

37:44.871 --> 37:46.046
All right.

37:46.089 --> 37:47.613
Get your coat.

37:48.962 --> 37:49.919
I'll be in the car.

37:49.963 --> 37:51.007
'Kay?

37:56.274 --> 37:57.971
[sighs]

38:02.758 --> 38:05.239
Hey. Thought we'd be
heading home by now.

38:05.283 --> 38:07.807
What's... all this?

38:07.850 --> 38:11.463
[sighs] Baby, if you really want
to get a gun for protection,

38:11.506 --> 38:13.334
you know I will support it.

38:13.378 --> 38:15.858
I just want to make sure
that you are really comfortable

38:15.902 --> 38:18.339
using one first.
'Kay?

38:18.383 --> 38:19.688
Okay.

38:19.732 --> 38:21.821
I can go a week
without shooting this thing.

38:21.864 --> 38:23.388
But then there's days
like today,

38:23.431 --> 38:25.390
where it's glued to my hand
and I have a split second

38:25.433 --> 38:27.609
to decide if I'm gonna pull
that trigger or not.

38:27.653 --> 38:30.308
This is what
this job is for me.

38:30.351 --> 38:32.440
It's instinctual
by now.

38:32.484 --> 38:34.007
But it wouldn't be for me.

38:34.050 --> 38:35.008
No.

38:35.051 --> 38:37.315
And that's what concerns me.

38:39.926 --> 38:41.971
Are you sure
you want to do this?

38:42.972 --> 38:44.234
Yeah.

38:45.235 --> 38:46.672
All right, step up here.

38:47.673 --> 38:48.761
I want you to get
a nice wide stance

38:48.804 --> 38:50.197
with your feet.

38:50.240 --> 38:52.199
Strong platform,
okay?

38:53.200 --> 38:54.723
Okay. Now, again,

38:54.767 --> 38:56.725
you always keep the gun
aimed forward.

38:56.769 --> 39:00.163
Take it from me.
Get a nice strong grip.

39:00.207 --> 39:01.730
There you go.
Finger off the trigger.

39:01.774 --> 39:03.558
There you go.
That's perfect. 'Kay?Mm.

39:03.602 --> 39:05.517
I'm gonna take the safety off.

39:06.648 --> 39:07.606
The gun is live

39:07.649 --> 39:09.738
and the range is hot.

39:11.000 --> 39:12.437
Take a breath.

39:13.525 --> 39:15.701
Baby, when
you're ready,

39:15.744 --> 39:17.703
find your target

39:17.746 --> 39:19.400
and pull the trigger
one time.

39:19.444 --> 39:20.836
[inhales deeply]

39:20.880 --> 39:22.838
[exhales]

39:28.191 --> 39:29.976
[gulps, exhales]

39:30.019 --> 39:32.195
Nichelle?[exhales]

39:32.239 --> 39:33.936
Baby, what's the matter?

39:34.894 --> 39:36.809
If I had a gun this morning,

39:36.852 --> 39:38.985
I would've shot Damiere.

39:39.028 --> 39:41.422
A 14-year-old kid
I used to tutor in math.

39:41.466 --> 39:42.771
[shuddering inhale]

39:42.815 --> 39:44.469
[exhales]

39:45.470 --> 39:47.646
I can't do this.
This isn't for me.Okay. O-Okay.

39:47.689 --> 39:48.995
Stay there.
I got it.

39:49.038 --> 39:50.605
Put it on safety.

39:50.649 --> 39:52.041
Okay, give me the gun.
It's okay. I got it.

39:52.085 --> 39:53.695
[exhales]

39:54.914 --> 39:55.871
Hey.

39:55.915 --> 39:57.003
[sighs]

39:57.046 --> 39:58.352
Are you sure?

39:59.397 --> 40:03.226
I think I was attracted
to the idea of a gun,

40:03.270 --> 40:05.620
because it seemed empowering.

40:05.664 --> 40:07.622
But I don't think I
could knowingly take

40:07.666 --> 40:09.058
someone else's
life that way.

40:09.102 --> 40:10.886
[inhales sharply]

40:10.930 --> 40:14.107
No, the power I lost
that I need to regain,

40:14.150 --> 40:17.110
that's not gonna come from
anywhere but inside here.

40:19.721 --> 40:21.680
Huh.

40:21.723 --> 40:25.466
Baby, I so wish more people
were as honest with themselves

40:25.510 --> 40:26.902
as you are about this stuff.

40:26.946 --> 40:28.469
Yeah, well,
when you spend

40:28.513 --> 40:31.254
a whole day second-guessing
your every decision,

40:31.298 --> 40:33.474
imagining all the...
[inhales deeply]

40:33.518 --> 40:36.042
terrible ways things could've
played out... [exhales]

40:38.348 --> 40:40.220
What happened this morning
scared the hell out of me.

40:40.263 --> 40:41.395
I know.

40:41.439 --> 40:43.397
Me, too.

40:43.441 --> 40:45.007
But what went down today

40:45.051 --> 40:47.923
was just one
really bad moment.

40:49.577 --> 40:53.929
Baby, we got a lifetime of
better ones to look forward to.

40:53.973 --> 40:55.670
[inhales deeply]Together.

40:55.714 --> 40:57.846
[exhales]

40:57.890 --> 40:59.587
Come here.

41:00.675 --> 41:02.547
Mmm.

41:03.591 --> 41:05.898
I love you so much.
