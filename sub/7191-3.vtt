00:02.460 --> 00:04.086
- Emma!

00:15.432 --> 00:16.516
- Where are we?

00:17.517 --> 00:18.685
Is this the cafeteria?

00:18.768 --> 00:20.019
- I was trying to tell you

00:20.103 --> 00:24.107
that the emergency exit
leads to Iridium High.

00:24.190 --> 00:26.067
- Great!
I'm closer to home.

00:26.151 --> 00:27.110
Let's go before Agamemnon--

00:27.193 --> 00:29.571
- Before Agamemnon what?

00:29.654 --> 00:31.656
Gets a snack?

00:31.740 --> 00:36.202
Or finds <i> the</i> two rogue
rebels running about?

00:36.286 --> 00:37.537
[laughing]

00:37.620 --> 00:38.997
Boom.

00:39.080 --> 00:40.623
Got you.

00:40.707 --> 00:44.794
I'm not surprised to see you
causing trouble, Mr. Novoa.

00:44.878 --> 00:47.046
- I-I was just trying--

00:47.130 --> 00:48.465
- Silence.

00:48.548 --> 00:52.343
You're always "just trying"
to take the Chosen One

00:52.427 --> 00:54.012
in the wrong direction.

00:54.095 --> 00:54.763
- Jax has nothing
to do with this.

00:54.846 --> 00:57.474
This was my decision.

00:57.557 --> 00:58.725
We passed the test.

00:58.808 --> 01:00.643
Now we need to go home.

01:00.727 --> 01:01.686
Please, Agamemnon.

01:01.770 --> 01:05.565
- Oh, no, don't
"Please, Agamemnon" me.

01:05.648 --> 01:08.276
You wanted to go
to a birthday party.

01:08.359 --> 01:10.945
- My dad's surprise
birthday party.

01:11.029 --> 01:13.239
I can come back tomorrow
and finish whatever's left.

01:13.323 --> 01:14.532
- Oh...

01:14.616 --> 01:17.118
that's so nice of you,

01:17.202 --> 01:18.578
but I don't think so.

01:18.661 --> 01:20.330
[laughs]
You'll stay here

01:20.413 --> 01:22.582
and finish your SOD,
and then--

01:22.665 --> 01:23.666
- That's not fair!

01:23.750 --> 01:24.709
All I did was cast
a couple spells.

01:24.793 --> 01:27.295
I'll be back tomorrow,
I promise.

01:27.378 --> 01:28.630
- Oh, fine, then.

01:28.713 --> 01:30.423
Go.

01:30.507 --> 01:31.591
But before you go,

01:31.674 --> 01:33.176
I'll have to take your powers

01:33.259 --> 01:34.469
until you complete boot camp.

01:34.552 --> 01:37.347
- No!

01:39.849 --> 01:43.520
- Where is the bottle
with the powers?

01:43.603 --> 01:45.688
- I think I still have them.
- Impossible.

01:45.772 --> 01:48.066
They must be
around here somewhere.

01:48.149 --> 01:49.901
- Quick, cast a spell.

01:49.984 --> 01:52.695
- I'm just getting back in gear,
make a bunch of flowers appear.

01:56.699 --> 01:58.618
- It worked.

01:58.701 --> 02:00.495
- It did.

02:00.578 --> 02:03.957
- You tried, but you can't
take her powers.

can't take her powers.

02:43.454 --> 02:44.497
[chuckling]

02:44.581 --> 02:46.541
I was just trying
to prove a point.

02:46.624 --> 02:49.043
- The point that you
can't take her powers.

02:49.127 --> 02:50.295
- I can.

02:50.378 --> 02:51.588
Watch me.

02:54.799 --> 02:56.676
[chuckling]

02:56.759 --> 02:58.261
Looky here!

Mr. Novoa's powers.

02:59.846 --> 03:02.181
- [sighs]

03:02.265 --> 03:03.474
No, not again!

03:03.558 --> 03:05.476
- Agamemnon--
- You learned your lesson.

03:05.560 --> 03:08.021
Go home.
You're done with boot camp.

03:08.104 --> 03:09.105
- I am?

03:09.188 --> 03:11.774
- You are.
Now scoot.

03:11.858 --> 03:12.317
- Thank you!
Thank you!

03:14.068 --> 03:15.153
What about Jax?

03:15.236 --> 03:16.321
- He'll spend the night
in the barracks.

03:16.404 --> 03:18.990
Of course,
he'll have to walk since...

03:19.073 --> 03:21.492
[chuckling]
He has no powers.

03:21.576 --> 03:22.785
- But I--

03:22.869 --> 03:24.787
- Now go, the both of you,

03:24.871 --> 03:26.956
before I change my mind.

03:27.040 --> 03:28.541
- I'm going.
I'm going.

03:29.876 --> 03:31.836
- [mouthing words]

03:33.046 --> 03:34.547
- I tried to make you a cake,

03:34.631 --> 03:37.133
but the mixer seems to have
a mind of its own.

03:37.216 --> 03:39.636
- You're now blaming
a kitchen appliance?

03:39.719 --> 03:43.932
- No, I--
- Oh, my poor Francisky Winky!

03:44.015 --> 03:45.433
I-I-I mean, um...
[clears throat]

03:45.516 --> 03:50.980
are you all right, Mr. Principal
Francisco Alonso, sir?

03:51.064 --> 03:51.814
- I am fine.
I am fine.

03:51.898 --> 03:54.150
Thank you very much.

03:54.233 --> 03:57.195
But, uh, what are you
all doing here?

03:57.278 --> 03:59.822
ANDI: Uh, it's your surprise
birthday party.

03:59.906 --> 04:01.074
Emma organized it.

04:01.157 --> 04:02.951
- Surprise!

04:03.034 --> 04:03.368
- Aah!

04:06.037 --> 04:08.081
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

04:08.164 --> 04:10.333
Emma organized this for me?

04:11.376 --> 04:11.834
A party?

04:11.918 --> 04:12.752
W-where is she?

04:12.835 --> 04:13.878
- On her way.

04:13.962 --> 04:16.047
There was a...

04:16.130 --> 04:17.464
- A smoothie situation
emergency at work.

04:17.548 --> 04:21.552
- Oh, those are the worst kinds
of emergencies.

04:21.636 --> 04:23.388
- Does this mean
we don't even get cake?

04:23.471 --> 04:25.723
- We haven't crashed
a party this lame

04:25.807 --> 04:27.767
since Andi's turtle-themed
eighth birthday.

04:27.850 --> 04:29.852
- Turtles are cool.

04:29.936 --> 04:31.020
You just don't get them.

04:33.272 --> 04:35.191
- Mmm.
Not bad.

04:35.274 --> 04:36.693
- Uh...

04:36.776 --> 04:38.653
how about we just call it
a night?

04:38.736 --> 04:40.488
- [laughs]
Fine with us.

04:40.571 --> 04:42.865
I already told Proxy
to meet me at my house.

04:42.949 --> 04:43.825
This party's a drag.

04:43.908 --> 04:45.868
- You can go.

04:45.952 --> 04:47.412
I'll just stay and clean up.

04:47.495 --> 04:49.789
- Are you sure you don't want me
to stay as your bodyguard?

04:49.872 --> 04:51.582
- I'll be okay.

04:51.666 --> 04:54.002
- My mess, my clean-up.

04:54.085 --> 04:55.712
- Whoops!
[chuckles]

04:57.797 --> 04:58.548
- Ooh!
- Whoop!

04:58.631 --> 05:00.383
Uh, this is--this is for you.

05:00.466 --> 05:03.886
And let me know
if the party is rescheduled.

05:03.970 --> 05:05.888
I'm available
for color schemes,

05:05.972 --> 05:08.224
and I'd also like to do,

05:08.307 --> 05:10.893
uh, some--some,
uh, slide shows.

05:10.977 --> 05:13.187
Okay.
Um, I love you.

05:21.821 --> 05:23.406
- I'm here.

05:23.489 --> 05:24.449
What do you need?

05:24.532 --> 05:25.908
- You're still at the beach?

05:25.992 --> 05:26.743
It's nighttime.

05:26.826 --> 05:29.078
- Not in Dubai.
[chuckles]

05:29.162 --> 05:31.372
So what is so important

05:31.456 --> 05:33.166
that I am missing
my paddleboard lesson?

05:33.249 --> 05:34.417
- It's the Chosen One.

05:34.500 --> 05:37.754
- Oh, for Pete's sake,
just say it!

05:37.837 --> 05:40.048
Agamemnon tried to take
Emma's powers...

05:40.131 --> 05:42.383
and couldn't.

05:42.467 --> 05:43.259
- [sighs]

05:43.342 --> 05:44.761
- We knew this day would come.

05:44.844 --> 05:46.137
- But so soon?

05:46.220 --> 05:49.015
- She's destined to be
the most powerful witch alive.

05:49.098 --> 05:50.141
It was bound to happen.

05:50.224 --> 05:52.602
- I don't see why
this is a problem.

05:52.685 --> 05:55.688
- Because
untrained chosen ones

05:55.772 --> 05:57.231
can go awry.

05:57.315 --> 06:00.276
Do you know how difficult it was
to take the principal's powers?

06:00.359 --> 06:03.112
- Emma's nothing like
the principal.

06:03.196 --> 06:04.906
She has a good heart.

06:04.989 --> 06:07.366
- But she is still
a teenage girl.

06:07.450 --> 06:08.409
- Great.

06:08.493 --> 06:10.495
The future of the Realm
is at the whim

06:10.578 --> 06:12.455
of the Chosen One's hormones.

06:16.417 --> 06:16.751
- Excuse me.

06:16.834 --> 06:19.087
- Sorry.

06:21.130 --> 06:23.674
Okay, how about you just
go whichever way you want?

06:23.758 --> 06:25.510
And I'll stand here
and do nothing.

06:25.593 --> 06:26.844
- Don't you have to go home?

06:26.928 --> 06:29.347
Don't your parents
wonder where you are?

06:29.430 --> 06:31.099
- No, they know I'm here.

06:31.182 --> 06:32.141
Of course they do.

06:32.225 --> 06:33.142
- Sorry I'm late!

06:33.226 --> 06:34.519
My dad should be home any min--

06:34.602 --> 06:35.978
- Where have you been?

06:36.062 --> 06:38.147
- Oh...no.

06:38.231 --> 06:39.273
I...

06:39.357 --> 06:39.982

and, of course...

- Witches are so mean!

07:03.089 --> 07:04.632
- I like the way you smell.

07:04.715 --> 07:05.424
- Which is?

07:05.508 --> 07:09.595
- Well, imagine if an onion

07:09.679 --> 07:11.180
and Muenster cheese

07:11.264 --> 07:12.557
got together and, um...

07:12.640 --> 07:13.558

Had a baby.

07:13.641 --> 07:16.185

But you love onions.

07:16.269 --> 07:17.812

{\an8}Whoa.

07:21.858 --> 07:23.109
{\an8}Check this out.

07:23.192 --> 07:26.821
- Is that a tattoo?

07:26.904 --> 07:28.614
- No, it's...

07:28.698 --> 07:30.533
It's a Kanay marking.

07:30.616 --> 07:32.285
Cool, huh?
It's a spider.

07:32.368 --> 07:33.995
- Do you have one?
- I don't know.

07:34.078 --> 07:35.288
Let's see.

07:38.166 --> 07:40.126
- [chuckles]
That never gets old.

07:40.209 --> 07:40.543
- [grunts]
There.

07:43.087 --> 07:44.755
- Um...

07:46.716 --> 07:48.301
Nope.

07:48.384 --> 07:50.344
You don't have any like that.

07:50.428 --> 07:53.681
Yours are totally awesome.

07:53.764 --> 07:57.560
See? We're learning
something new about Kanays.

07:57.643 --> 07:59.770
They have different markings.

07:59.854 --> 08:02.231
- Makes sense, but...

08:02.315 --> 08:03.733
what does the spider mean?

08:03.816 --> 08:06.736
- Maybe it's
like a tribe thing?

08:06.819 --> 08:09.572
Like each group has
a different set of markings.

08:09.655 --> 08:10.781
URSULA: Maddie Winky,
I think we should--

08:10.865 --> 08:12.491

08:19.999 --> 08:21.918
[all breathing heavily]

08:22.001 --> 08:23.502
- And we're in.

08:23.586 --> 08:24.754
- Easy as pie.

08:24.837 --> 08:27.423

before Diego catches us.

He's fine.

08:54.659 --> 08:55.409
Now let's get on with this.

08:55.493 --> 08:57.536
- We're wasting our time.

08:57.620 --> 08:59.580
We need to look
at those security cameras.

08:59.664 --> 09:01.707
TOMMY:
I'm okay. I'm okay.

09:05.253 --> 09:05.670
- Here's the recorder.

- Uh, hey, Mia.

09:19.392 --> 09:21.894
What happened to Slow Joe?

09:21.978 --> 09:23.145
- Um, Slow Joe?

09:23.229 --> 09:24.647
I don't know.

09:24.730 --> 09:27.358
But I think the name
says it all.

the Octocannon.

19:36.091 --> 19:36.925
