00:07.955 --> 00:11.496
Guys, I have some bad news.

00:11.823 --> 00:14.663
The first show of Austin's
tour got canceled.

00:14.664 --> 00:15.958
Aw.

00:15.959 --> 00:18.276
Because too many
people wanted tickets.

00:18.277 --> 00:19.301
What?!

00:19.302 --> 00:21.893
They had to move the show from
a place that seats 1,000.

00:21.894 --> 00:23.828
To a place that seats 10,000!

00:23.829 --> 00:25.796
- Yes!
- No way!

00:25.797 --> 00:29.097
I can't believe this. I'm going on
tour with my three best friends.

00:29.098 --> 00:30.998
This is gonna be the
best summer ever.

00:30.999 --> 00:33.967
No work for three months.

00:33.968 --> 00:35.914
You're the tour manager.

00:35.915 --> 00:38.795
Right. Forgot that.

00:38.804 --> 00:40.950
Still cool.

00:40.951 --> 00:43.380
Think of all the amazing
things we'll see.

00:43.381 --> 00:47.942
The Grand Canyon, Mount Rushmore, the
Albuquerque Cloud Watching Museum.

00:47.943 --> 00:52.211
I'm gonna be playing arenas, meeting
fans, eating pancakes in every state.

00:52.212 --> 00:54.565
And we get to go to the
bathroom on a bus.

00:54.566 --> 00:56.721
Every day!

00:56.722 --> 00:59.854
Yup, something for everybody.

00:59.855 --> 01:02.646
It doesn't get much
better than this.

01:02.647 --> 01:05.900
Thanks, Trish. I know how hard you've
been working on this tour for me.

01:05.901 --> 01:07.937
Thanks, Austin.

01:07.938 --> 01:10.641
And Ally, I haven't
forgotten about you.

01:10.642 --> 01:14.597
Oh, did you follow up with that
label that wanted my demo?

01:14.598 --> 01:17.112
Forgot about that.

01:17.113 --> 01:20.465
I have something bigger in
the works for your career.

01:20.466 --> 01:23.867
I just can't tell you till
tomorrow because it's a surprise.

01:23.868 --> 01:25.496
Really?

01:25.497 --> 01:31.397
Thanks, Trish. I knew my best
friend would come through for me.

01:32.962 --> 01:35.461
- You didn't come through, did you?
- Nope.

01:35.462 --> 01:36.840
What am I gonna do?

01:36.841 --> 01:39.674
I have one day to come up
with a surprise for Ally.

01:39.675 --> 01:42.644
If you think about it, since
she's expecting a surprise,

01:42.645 --> 01:46.785
not having a surprise
is a surprise.

01:51.720 --> 01:54.822
<i>♪ When the crowd wants more,
I bring on the thunder.</i>

01:54.823 --> 01:57.957
<i>♪ 'Cause you've got my back,
and I'm not going under.</i>

01:57.958 --> 01:59.489
<i>♪ You're my point,
you're my guard.</i>

01:59.490 --> 02:01.108
<i>♪ You're the perfect chord.</i>

02:01.109 --> 02:04.153
<i>♪ And I see our names
together on every billboard.</i>

02:04.154 --> 02:07.212
<i>♪ We're headed for the
top, we've got it on lock.</i>

02:07.213 --> 02:08.826
<i>♪ We'll make 'em say "hey!"</i>

02:08.827 --> 02:11.149
<i>♪ And we'll keep rockin'.</i>

02:11.150 --> 02:15.287
<i>♪ Oh, there's no way I
could make it without ya.</i>

02:15.288 --> 02:18.323
<i>♪ Do it without ya,
be here without ya.</i>

02:18.324 --> 02:21.393
<i>♪ It's no fun when
you're doing it solo.</i>

02:21.394 --> 02:24.716
<i>♪ With you it's like, "whoa".
Yeah, and I know.</i>

02:24.717 --> 02:27.366
<i>♪ I own this dream.</i>

02:27.367 --> 02:30.744
<i>♪ 'Cause I got you with me.</i>

02:30.745 --> 02:33.862
<i>♪ There's no way I could
make it without ya.</i>

02:33.863 --> 02:38.303
<i>♪ Do it without ya,
be here without ya.</i>

02:45.143 --> 02:50.789
So according to your resume, you
quit your last six jobs because...

02:50.790 --> 02:53.550
You hate working.

02:53.700 --> 02:59.220
I'm not hiring you, but I
might have a girl for you.

02:59.955 --> 03:01.712
Good luck.

03:01.713 --> 03:03.123
Who was that?

03:03.124 --> 03:05.167
Since I'm going with you
on tour all summer,

03:05.168 --> 03:07.719
my Dad wants me to
hire my replacement.

03:07.720 --> 03:10.986
- Maybe I could work here.
- Never.

03:10.987 --> 03:13.511
And besides, you're gonna
be on tour with us.

03:13.512 --> 03:15.472
Maybe not. Get this;

03:15.473 --> 03:18.037
My parents told me that if I
don't pass our biology final,

03:18.038 --> 03:19.925
they're not gonna let
me go on the tour.

03:19.926 --> 03:22.007
You got to pass that test.

03:22.008 --> 03:24.653
I can't imagine not having my
best friend on tour with me.

03:24.654 --> 03:27.709
If only there was someone
who would help me study.

03:27.710 --> 03:33.083
Someone really smart who knows a lot
about smart stuff like biology.

03:33.084 --> 03:36.438
Of course I'll help
you study, Dez.

03:36.439 --> 03:39.259
Uh, thanks, buddy.

03:39.991 --> 03:42.451
I meant you.

03:44.096 --> 03:47.254
Oh, Trish, what's my surprise?!

03:47.255 --> 03:49.760
Sorry, that was rude. Um,
hi, Trish, how are you?

03:49.761 --> 03:51.570
How was work?
What's my surprise?

03:51.571 --> 03:53.205
Thanks for asking, Ally.

03:53.206 --> 03:54.779
I'm good. My job stinks.

03:54.780 --> 03:57.042
I got you a meeting
with Ronnie Ramone.

03:57.043 --> 03:59.616
From Ramone Records? No way!

03:59.617 --> 04:01.922
All I had to do was
tell him who I was and

04:01.934 --> 04:04.250
that I had a hot new
artist he had to meet.

04:04.251 --> 04:07.189
And when that didn't
work, I told him that

04:07.201 --> 04:10.151
Austin would play at
his son's Bar Mitzvah.

04:10.157 --> 04:11.631
Thanks, Trish.

04:11.632 --> 04:13.860
You really came through for me.

04:13.861 --> 04:15.357
You should thank me.

04:15.358 --> 04:17.863
I'm the one who's gonna play
a song at some Bar Mitzvah.

04:17.865 --> 04:23.765
Actually it's ten songs and you have
to slow dance with the Grandma.

04:28.042 --> 04:29.062
Trachea.

04:29.063 --> 04:31.110
Mitochondria. Occipital Lobe.

04:31.111 --> 04:33.082
Pituitary Gland. Osmosis.

04:33.083 --> 04:34.699
That was all of them.
You did it!

04:34.700 --> 04:37.220
- Woo!
- Yes.

04:39.016 --> 04:41.287
All I did was read those
words off those cards.

04:41.288 --> 04:43.409
I still don't know
what they mean.

04:43.410 --> 04:48.990
Yeah, I don't think we're
using these flashcards right.

04:53.934 --> 04:55.911
Ronnie Ramone should
be here any minute.

04:55.912 --> 04:57.677
You can't mess this up.

04:57.678 --> 04:59.906
So don't talk about stuff
nobody cares about

04:59.907 --> 05:02.842
like that time your bird fell
in love with a cuckoo clock.

05:02.843 --> 05:05.077
Everyone loves that story.

05:05.078 --> 05:09.193
It was so cute. Oh, it would wait by the
clock every hour for his girlfriend...

05:09.194 --> 05:11.951
- What did I just say?
- Sorry.

05:11.952 --> 05:13.952
I'm just really excited.

05:13.953 --> 05:17.580
It means a lot to me
to finally get a shot.

05:17.581 --> 05:19.981
Ally Dawson?

05:20.430 --> 05:21.927
Yes.

05:21.928 --> 05:23.828
I'm Ally Dawson.

05:23.829 --> 05:24.996
It's me.

05:24.997 --> 05:28.066
Hello, it is so
nice to meet you.

05:28.067 --> 05:30.415
- Ally...
- Oh oh.

05:30.416 --> 05:34.578
Sorry. I'm just really excited...
and I'm a hugger.

05:34.579 --> 05:37.075
Not that I don't
like shaking hands.

05:37.076 --> 05:39.827
And I also do this thing where I
talk too much when I get nervous.

05:39.828 --> 05:41.494
I'm Trish, Ally's manager.

05:41.495 --> 05:44.215
- Great to meet you in person.
- You're the manager?

05:44.216 --> 05:46.851
Hopefully I'll get to
work with you too.

05:46.852 --> 05:48.725
We can talk upstairs.

05:48.726 --> 05:50.706
Great.

05:52.745 --> 05:56.945
Thanks again, Trish.
You're the best.

06:03.502 --> 06:04.616
Hello?

06:04.617 --> 06:07.317
Yeah, this is Trish.

06:07.318 --> 06:12.296
What do you mean "this is Ronnie Ramone.
Where's Ally"?

06:12.297 --> 06:16.967
What do you mean "the meeting was
supposed to be in your office"?

06:16.968 --> 06:20.894
What do you mean "you blew it,
I'll never work with Ally now"?!

06:20.895 --> 06:24.712
What do you mean "why do you keep
repeating everything I say?"

06:24.713 --> 06:26.693
Hello?

06:26.783 --> 06:28.763
Hello?

06:29.043 --> 06:31.203
Oh, man.

06:31.745 --> 06:35.945
Wait, then who's
that guy with Ally?

06:39.562 --> 06:42.030
<i>♪ Staring at...</i>

06:42.031 --> 06:44.407
<i>♪ My reflection.</i>

06:44.408 --> 06:48.728
<i>♪ Who's that girl
looking back at me?</i>

06:48.836 --> 06:51.688
<i>♪ Once I thought...</i>

06:51.689 --> 06:53.784
<i>♪ That I knew her.</i>

06:53.785 --> 06:56.034
<i>♪ But she's not...</i>

06:56.035 --> 06:59.815
Um, Trish, what's so important?

07:00.018 --> 07:02.152
I'm so sorry, Mr. Ramone.

07:02.153 --> 07:04.461
This isn't Ronnie Ramone.

07:04.462 --> 07:06.045
Huh?

07:06.046 --> 07:08.637
You're not Ronnie Ramone?

07:08.638 --> 07:11.028
Who are you?

07:11.029 --> 07:13.336
I'm Roger Dunlap. I just...

07:13.337 --> 07:16.981
Came here to apply here for a job,
but I really do like your songs.

07:16.982 --> 07:21.619
And I love the story with the
bird and the cuckoo clock.

07:21.620 --> 07:24.928
Wait, Trish, what's going on?

07:24.929 --> 07:26.455
I messed up.

07:26.456 --> 07:29.930
You were supposed to go to
Ronnie Ramone's office.

07:29.931 --> 07:33.430
And now he said he kind of
never wants to meet with you.

07:33.431 --> 07:34.972
I can't believe this.

07:34.973 --> 07:37.912
I know! He's being
so unreasonable.

07:37.913 --> 07:40.771
No, I'm talking about you.

07:40.772 --> 07:42.206
I'm sorry.

07:42.207 --> 07:44.847
I've just kind of had my hands
full with Austin's tour.

07:44.848 --> 07:48.696
Maybe managing both me and
Austin is too much for you.

07:48.697 --> 07:52.342
Are you really asking me to
choose between you and Austin?

07:52.343 --> 07:54.143
No.

07:54.380 --> 07:56.881
You don't have to
choose because...

07:56.882 --> 07:59.582
I'm firing you.

08:03.566 --> 08:07.786
So uh, should I just fill out an
application or leave a resume, or...?

08:07.787 --> 08:13.687
You know what, I'm just gonna come back
another, I can just come back another time.

08:15.000 --> 08:21.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

08:23.723 --> 08:28.124
Oh! It's Trish. I don't
want her to see me here.

08:28.125 --> 08:29.832
Hey, Ally. Dez, I see you.

08:29.833 --> 08:32.106
Aw! How'd you see me?

08:32.107 --> 08:34.604
The doors are made of glass.

08:34.605 --> 08:37.544
They are, aren't they?

08:37.544 --> 08:39.138
What are you guys doing?

08:39.139 --> 08:41.337
Fine! She's tutoring me.

08:41.337 --> 08:44.610
But don't tell Austin. It'll
really hurt his feelings.

08:44.611 --> 08:47.311
Come on, George.

08:49.698 --> 08:51.036
Listen, Ally.

08:51.037 --> 08:54.338
I'm really sorry
about what happened.

08:54.339 --> 08:56.872
I appreciate your apology.

08:56.873 --> 08:59.556
So I'm your manager again?

08:59.557 --> 09:04.696
Trish, I need somebody who's gonna
take my music as seriously as I do.

09:04.697 --> 09:06.943
Obviously, you don't.

09:06.944 --> 09:08.561
I do.

09:08.562 --> 09:10.133
And I'm gonna prove you wrong.

09:10.134 --> 09:12.814
No one fires Trish De La Rosa!

09:12.815 --> 09:14.855
Nobody!

09:15.967 --> 09:19.867
Everybody fires
Trish De La Rosa.

09:24.023 --> 09:26.536
What do you mean "this is the
30th time you've called,"

09:26.537 --> 09:29.800
"stop calling, Ronnie Ramone
doesn't want to talk to you"?

09:29.801 --> 09:31.674
Hey, Trish! Great news.

09:31.675 --> 09:34.894
I've been talking to Jimmy Starr about
letting Ally open up for me on tour.

09:34.895 --> 09:36.046
And?

09:36.047 --> 09:40.096
And he said, there's no way
he can make that happen.

09:40.097 --> 09:43.082
Your definition of great
news is different than mine.

09:43.083 --> 09:44.998
Well, here's the great part.

09:44.999 --> 09:48.105
We worked it out so Ally can open
up for me this weekend in Miami.

09:48.106 --> 09:49.723
That's amazing!

09:49.724 --> 09:51.839
And I want you to tell
her that you set it up.

09:51.840 --> 09:54.223
You do? Why?

09:54.224 --> 09:55.897
Ally told me she fired you.

09:55.898 --> 09:58.093
I don't want this to
ruin your friendship.

09:58.094 --> 10:02.861
So you want me to take credit
for something I didn't do?

10:02.862 --> 10:05.158
Thanks, Austin!

10:05.159 --> 10:08.338
We're team Austin and Ally.
We work together.

10:08.339 --> 10:13.443
Besides, I don't to be trapped on a
tour bus with two fighting girls.

10:13.444 --> 10:16.362
Unless they're fighting over me.

10:16.363 --> 10:19.135
Oh, Ally, can we talk?

10:19.136 --> 10:21.680
Not now, I have some bad news.

10:21.681 --> 10:25.019
I only got a 92 on
the biology test.

10:25.020 --> 10:27.529
My lowest "A" ever.

10:27.530 --> 10:30.799
Your definition of bad news
is different than mine.

10:30.800 --> 10:33.681
I'm worried about Dez.
That was a hard test.

10:33.682 --> 10:35.764
If he doesn't pass,
he can't go on tour.

10:35.765 --> 10:38.332
He's gonna pass the test.

10:38.333 --> 10:41.273
I helped him study.

10:42.511 --> 10:45.452
Well, Ally, I've got some
news that'll cheer you up.

10:45.453 --> 10:48.689
You're gonna be the opening
act at Austin's Miami show!

10:48.690 --> 10:51.414
You're gonna perform in
front of 10,000 people.

10:51.415 --> 10:53.434
Trish, that's awesome!

10:53.435 --> 10:57.155
I can't believe you did this.

10:57.365 --> 10:58.872
I got a 94.

10:58.873 --> 11:00.186
I got a 94.

11:00.187 --> 11:01.591
I got a 94!

11:01.592 --> 11:04.924
Not only did I pass, I got
an "A." I'm going on tour.

11:04.925 --> 11:06.785
Woo.

11:08.355 --> 11:10.018
Wait a sec.

11:10.019 --> 11:11.647
You got a 94?

11:11.648 --> 11:13.578
I got a 92. That means...

11:13.579 --> 11:17.203
Yup. I got three more
points than you.

11:17.204 --> 11:20.428
Who's the smart one now?

11:20.429 --> 11:21.905
<i>♪ I got an "A".</i>

11:21.906 --> 11:24.066
<i>♪ A 94.</i>

11:27.808 --> 11:29.765
I can't believe it. The
first show of my tour.

11:29.766 --> 11:31.843
Oh, your biggest concert ever.

11:31.844 --> 11:33.337
I'm the opening act.

11:33.338 --> 11:37.260
And I got a higher score than
Ally on our biology test.

11:37.261 --> 11:41.586
Can you believe you're about to
perform in front of 10,000 people?

11:41.587 --> 11:43.953
I'd say that's pretty
good managering.

11:43.954 --> 11:47.216
Maybe I overreacted
when I fired you.

11:47.217 --> 11:48.827
Will you be my manager again?

11:48.828 --> 11:52.140
Hmm, let me think about it.

11:52.141 --> 11:54.601
Kidding! Yes.

11:54.734 --> 11:56.950
Austin Moon, congrats
on the tour.

11:56.951 --> 11:59.020
Thanks, Jimmy. I am so excited.

11:59.021 --> 11:59.934
Guess what?

11:59.935 --> 12:03.740
I got a 94 on my biology
test and Ally only got a 92.

12:03.741 --> 12:05.353
Don't care.

12:05.354 --> 12:07.412
Wait, seriously?

12:07.413 --> 12:10.615
- I helped him study.
- Seriously?!

12:10.616 --> 12:12.303
Anyway, have a good show.

12:12.304 --> 12:13.452
You too, Ally.

12:13.453 --> 12:16.788
Thanks. I can't believe I'm
actually performing tonight.

12:16.789 --> 12:18.167
Well, thank Austin.

12:18.168 --> 12:20.235
When he came up with the
idea to have you open...

12:20.236 --> 12:22.760
Wait. Austin got me this gig?

12:22.761 --> 12:25.187
- Yeah...
- Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy!

12:25.188 --> 12:27.833
I need you to help me
with my pre-show ritual.

12:27.834 --> 12:30.402
Pre-show ritual? What is it?

12:30.403 --> 12:32.804
Um... it starts with...

12:32.805 --> 12:35.156
Walking really fast that way.

12:35.157 --> 12:37.077
Yeah.

12:39.346 --> 12:40.779
I'm sorry, Ally.

12:40.780 --> 12:43.257
I can't believe you lied to me.

12:43.258 --> 12:46.828
Maybe I overreacted
when I hired you back.

12:46.829 --> 12:49.208
Sorry, Trish. I'm
firing you again.

12:49.209 --> 12:50.655
Aw.

12:50.656 --> 12:53.443
Fired twice from the same job.

12:53.444 --> 12:58.844
This has only happened to me like four...
five times.

13:00.254 --> 13:02.734
Ally Dawson, I'm gonna
get right to the point.

13:02.735 --> 13:04.372
I am Ronnie Ramone.

13:04.373 --> 13:06.571
You showed up!

13:06.572 --> 13:08.956
Ronnie Ramone! What
are you doing here?

13:08.957 --> 13:10.963
Well, Trish sent me a
basket apologizing for the

13:10.964 --> 13:13.449
mix-up with some tickets
for a nice concert.

13:13.450 --> 13:15.066
- She did?
- Mm hmm.

13:15.067 --> 13:17.369
She doesn't take "no" for an
answer when it comes to you.

13:17.370 --> 13:21.242
You got one great
manager there, Ally.

13:21.243 --> 13:23.269
Yes, I do.

13:23.270 --> 13:25.204
Thanks for coming through.

13:25.205 --> 13:27.625
Better late than never.

13:27.626 --> 13:29.760
Don't thank her just yet.
She only got me here.

13:29.761 --> 13:31.495
I'm gonna get right
to the point.

13:31.496 --> 13:35.732
I liked your demo, but I need to love
your performance if I'm gonna sign you.

13:35.733 --> 13:37.534
Let me get right to the point.

13:37.535 --> 13:38.802
You'll love it.

13:38.803 --> 13:41.605
I hope so. Now I got
to go look for Austin.

13:41.606 --> 13:47.506
I want to look over that song
list for my son's Bar Mitzvah.

13:50.004 --> 13:52.884
What's up, Miami?!

13:54.389 --> 13:57.122
It means so much to me
to be able to introduce

13:57.123 --> 13:59.723
this amazing songwriter
and performer.

13:59.724 --> 14:01.426
Someone who's really
special to me.

14:01.427 --> 14:04.967
Give it up for Ally Dawson!

- That was great.
- Oh, thank you! Thank you, thank you.

15:54.128 --> 15:57.221
Oh, I've never played for
that many people before.

15:57.222 --> 16:00.273
That was the most
incredible feeling ever.

16:00.274 --> 16:02.216
Well, I'm up next. I
better go get ready.

16:02.217 --> 16:04.662
I'll be your bodyguard,
make sure you're safe.

16:04.663 --> 16:06.452
Ah!

16:06.453 --> 16:09.753
Back away from the star.

16:09.823 --> 16:11.683
Dez.

16:12.001 --> 16:13.861
Man.

16:14.694 --> 16:17.157
Ally Dawson, I'm gonna
get right to the point.

16:17.158 --> 16:19.564
I was really impressed
with your performance.

16:19.565 --> 16:21.919
I want to make a
record with you.

16:21.920 --> 16:25.079
- You're getting a record deal!
- I'm getting a record deal!

16:25.080 --> 16:26.866
Yeah, sorry.

16:26.867 --> 16:31.469
Let's get started right away. I
want you in the studio tomorrow.

16:31.470 --> 16:33.630
Tomorrow?

16:33.706 --> 16:36.915
But I'm supposed to go
on tour with Austin.

16:36.916 --> 16:40.177
The question you need to ask yourself
is what's more important to you?

16:40.178 --> 16:41.940
Austin's career...

16:41.941 --> 16:44.161
Or yours?

16:53.193 --> 16:56.129
- I don't know what to do, Trish.
- It's a no brainer.

16:56.130 --> 17:01.103
Making a record with Ronnie Ramone
is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

17:01.104 --> 17:03.102
So you think I should stay?

17:03.103 --> 17:04.237
Yes.

17:04.238 --> 17:06.571
You wanted me to be
a better manager.

17:06.573 --> 17:08.207
Well, I'm doing my job.

17:08.208 --> 17:09.976
Now take my advice.

17:09.977 --> 17:12.851
But I don't want to miss
going on Austin's tour.

17:12.852 --> 17:14.530
I'm his songwriter.

17:14.531 --> 17:18.026
Being apart could affect how
we feel about each other...

17:18.027 --> 17:20.247
's songs.

17:21.209 --> 17:22.185
Wait.

17:22.186 --> 17:27.242
Is this about being his songwriter
or being his something else?

17:27.243 --> 17:29.224
What?!

17:30.746 --> 17:35.214
Okay, fine. I like Austin and
I'm pretty sure he likes me.

17:35.215 --> 17:37.467
I'm afraid if I don't go
with him on this tour,

17:37.468 --> 17:40.305
everything's gonna be
different when he get's back.

17:40.306 --> 17:42.992
Feelings can change
in three months.

17:42.993 --> 17:45.876
You know whose
feelings will change?

17:45.877 --> 17:50.317
Ronnie Ramone's if
you get on that bus.

17:50.383 --> 17:53.876
Ladies and gentlemen, kicking
off his first national tour...

17:53.877 --> 17:56.840

20:14.416 --> 20:16.023
- Whoa.
- You were amazing.

20:16.024 --> 20:16.947
You rocked!

20:16.948 --> 20:19.831
First night of the tour down.
85 more shows to go.

20:19.832 --> 20:24.718
The four of us are gonna
have the best time ever.

20:24.719 --> 20:26.377
What?

20:26.378 --> 20:28.199
Austin...

20:28.200 --> 20:31.112
I've been offered a record
deal with Ronnie Ramone.

20:31.113 --> 20:34.048
That's incredible! That's
what you've always wanted.

20:34.049 --> 20:35.387
I know.

20:35.388 --> 20:39.343
But if I accept, it means I
can't go on tour with you.

20:39.344 --> 20:41.144
Oh.

20:41.704 --> 20:43.564
Wow.

20:53.781 --> 20:56.528
- Have you talked to Ally?
- Not since yesterday.

20:56.529 --> 20:58.171
What do you think
she's gonna do?

20:58.172 --> 21:01.660
She's not coming. There's no way
she's passing up a record deal.

21:01.661 --> 21:03.639
It's the chance of a lifetime.

21:03.640 --> 21:06.342
She's coming. I saw
this in a movie once.

21:06.343 --> 21:10.350
She'll run up, jump into your arms,
and you'll live happily every after.

21:10.351 --> 21:13.410
Unless she decides to marry the
Colonel for his family's fortune.

21:13.411 --> 21:15.970
I saw that in a movie too.

21:15.971 --> 21:17.688
- She's not coming.
- She's coming.

21:17.689 --> 21:19.492
Guys, I can settle this.

21:19.493 --> 21:21.995
She's either not coming
or she's coming.

21:21.996 --> 21:23.976
There.

21:27.067 --> 21:28.644
Oh, no.

21:28.645 --> 21:29.809
She's not coming?

21:29.810 --> 21:33.413
No, it's the frozen yogurt place.
I forgot I had a job there.

21:33.414 --> 21:35.634
Oh, well.

21:36.784 --> 21:42.184
I think Jimmy's trying to
tell us it's time to go.

21:42.317 --> 21:45.137
She's not coming.

21:47.422 --> 21:49.342
Wait!

21:49.516 --> 21:50.791
Ally?

21:50.792 --> 21:54.027
- I knew you'd come.
- Take that, Colonel.

21:54.028 --> 21:57.684
- Who's the Colonel?
- I'll tell you on the bus.

21:57.685 --> 22:01.285
I'm not getting on the bus.

22:02.403 --> 22:05.256
I'm here to say good-bye.

22:05.257 --> 22:07.057
Oh.

22:12.920 --> 22:17.108
Is it because I got a better score
than you on that stupid test?

22:17.109 --> 22:18.909
No.

22:23.023 --> 22:28.154
I'm gonna go now because I
don't want you to see me cry.

22:28.155 --> 22:31.935
It's too late. It's too late!

22:34.605 --> 22:40.505
I'm gonna miss you, but I know
you're doing the right thing.

22:44.166 --> 22:46.547
By the way, can you stop
by the frozen yogurt place

22:46.548 --> 22:51.468
and tell them I'm gonna
be three months late?

22:56.944 --> 22:59.584
Gonna miss you.

22:59.881 --> 23:03.078
I'm gonna miss you too.

23:03.079 --> 23:04.714
We shouldn't be sad.

23:04.715 --> 23:06.710
You're making a record.

23:06.711 --> 23:08.031
I'm so proud of you.

23:08.032 --> 23:09.435
I know.

23:09.436 --> 23:12.075
And you're going on
your first tour.

23:12.076 --> 23:15.407
And hey, we're only gonna be
apart for like three months.

23:15.408 --> 23:18.588
Actually it's 94 days.

23:18.788 --> 23:24.068
- Hey, 94, that's like with Dez...
- Don't say it.

23:24.184 --> 23:27.386
I guess this is good-bye.

23:27.387 --> 23:29.062
Have fun on tour.

23:29.063 --> 23:31.716
Good luck making your record.

23:31.717 --> 23:35.317
I know it's gonna be great.

23:54.787 --> 23:56.746
- Ally, wait.
- Austin, what are you...

23:56.747 --> 24:00.472
Ally, I just wanted
to say that I...

24:00.473 --> 24:02.333
I...

24:05.016 --> 24:06.936
Here.

24:06.952 --> 24:09.131
Says it all in there.

24:09.132 --> 24:14.832
I was gonna send it to you
in case you didn't show up.

24:50.410 --> 24:53.110
Thinking of you.
