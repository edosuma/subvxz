www.opensubtitles.org

00:28.440 --> 00:31.120
Time to rest, darling.  Let's put this away.

00:41.520 --> 00:42.840
Shhhh, Hide, Hide.

03:06.080 --> 03:06.960
Maksim.

03:07.640 --> 03:09.040
Yes, mother.

03:10.200 --> 03:11.920
I have a gift for you.

03:15.560 --> 03:16.480
Wow!

03:16.600 --> 03:18.200
It's just like the one that Ivan has.

03:20.680 --> 03:21.880
Do you like it? -I do.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.520
This is the symbol of our family.

03:29.440 --> 03:32.400
Go and learn from your father.
Become a great hunter.

03:34.600 --> 03:36.400
And catch me some dinner.

04:59.640 --> 05:02.880
What are you so happy about?
I let you win.

05:04.200 --> 05:05.640
I know.

05:14.480 --> 05:15.480
Petro.

05:16.400 --> 05:17.560
Petro.

05:20.120 --> 05:21.720
What do you think of this one?

05:22.600 --> 05:24.000
Fine quality, ehh?

05:33.520 --> 05:35.000
Sharp. Strong.

05:37.160 --> 05:38.560
Yes, great.

05:40.600 --> 05:41.600
Yes.

05:42.000 --> 05:45.200
We will go hunting after the festival.

05:45.360 --> 05:46.680
Right, next time.

05:47.960 --> 05:48.520
Yes.

06:03.160 --> 06:05.200
Not only are they killing my sheep,

06:05.360 --> 06:08.520
My horse stables were burnt to the ground.

06:09.600 --> 06:12.080
This lawlessmess can not continue.

06:12.800 --> 06:14.120
Tugar Volk...

06:14.880 --> 06:17.120
must leave our lands.

06:17.280 --> 06:19.440
I can not exile Tugar Volk

06:19.600 --> 06:21.840
without calling him to our council meeting

06:22.000 --> 06:23.920
and hearing what he has to say.

06:24.480 --> 06:25.800
He will never show.

06:26.440 --> 06:29.080
He thinks he's above us.

06:29.600 --> 06:31.880
I know that you and he are not from Tukhlia,

06:33.080 --> 06:36.120
but you fought alongside
this man in Kolka.

06:36.880 --> 06:39.120
Why can you not get through to him?

06:39.880 --> 06:41.840
That was a long time ago.

06:43.120 --> 06:45.880
He is not the same man he was back then.

06:56.200 --> 06:57.200
Maksim.

06:58.040 --> 06:59.160
Yes father?

06:59.320 --> 07:02.160
Tugar Volk needs a guide
to help him hunt a bear

07:02.320 --> 07:04.480
that has seen near his estates.

07:04.640 --> 07:08.720
You will lead the hunt and use it to ask
him to come to our next town meeting.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.520
Do it in a way that he agrees to come.

07:11.960 --> 07:15.200
But, father, I am not the most
appropriate  person for this job.

07:15.360 --> 07:17.920
-Why not send Ivan?
-He speaks better than I.

07:20.600 --> 07:22.360
Then it is settled.

07:23.600 --> 07:25.600
You will ride in the morning.

07:28.440 --> 07:30.760
People say that Tugar Volk's
daughter is beautiful.

07:30.920 --> 07:34.880
If she's anything like his father, she probably
has a face that will scare away the wolves.

07:35.760 --> 07:38.400
Then the two of you will make a perfect match for each other.

07:40.640 --> 07:41.640
Ivan!

07:43.160 --> 07:45.080
You talk too much.

07:45.760 --> 07:46.840
You will be going with him.

07:51.640 --> 07:52.920
Guess we get to see for ourselves.

07:56.840 --> 07:58.360
Are you going to ask him?

07:58.920 --> 08:00.520
Are you going to ask him?

08:01.960 --> 08:04.040
Farther rasked you with this job.

08:08.840 --> 08:10.280
This is strange.

08:10.560 --> 08:14.480
They won't recognize your rule but
they're willing you to take you on a hunt?

08:15.680 --> 08:18.200
There's no unity.  No unity amongst us anymore.

08:19.200 --> 08:21.840
I'll teach you how a true commander leads.

08:26.400 --> 08:27.560
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

08:37.558 --> 08:39.799
Think it's best we go on foot from here.

08:40.159 --> 08:42.840
 If we encounter a beast, it might startle the horses.

08:50.160 --> 08:51.040
Look.

08:51.320 --> 08:53.320
-On the log. -Bear marks.

08:54.400 --> 08:55.400
Tell the men.

08:56.560 --> 08:57.640
This Way.

09:19.920 --> 09:22.840
A face that will
scare away the wolves Ehhh?

11:07.160 --> 11:08.920
Go!  I'll goet the others.

13:45.400 --> 13:46.800
You'r all right?

13:47.320 --> 13:48.360
Yes.

14:03.240 --> 14:04.520
What's your name?

14:07.360 --> 14:08.360
Maksim.

14:09.360 --> 14:10.280
And you?

14:11.040 --> 14:12.560
Myroslava.

14:14.800 --> 14:17.200
You're the guide helping my father?

14:18.320 --> 14:20.440
I'm actually here to help my father.

14:20.600 --> 14:23.360
We need Tugar Volk to
come to our town meeting.

14:23.960 --> 14:25.120
In Tukhlia.

14:27.080 --> 14:28.000
Tukhlia?

14:28.400 --> 14:29.120
Maksim?

14:31.280 --> 14:32.680
Everything's all right, Ivan.

14:41.360 --> 14:43.360
-You first. -No. I insist.

14:44.520 --> 14:45.360
Maksim.

14:46.280 --> 14:47.280
Thank you.

14:53.040 --> 14:55.160
Myro!  Myroslava!

14:56.680 --> 14:58.000
Where's my daughter?

14:58.720 --> 14:59.440
Myro!

15:00.160 --> 15:01.840
I'm okay, I'm fine.

15:02.200 --> 15:04.040
Take your hands off her.

15:04.480 --> 15:05.920
Please help him.

15:09.600 --> 15:12.320
Hah, Ah-Ah, Leave him. Come on, Let's go. Hunt's over.

15:12.560 --> 15:14.480
If it wasn't for Maksim I'd be dead.

15:14.720 --> 15:16.080
-Who? -Him.

15:16.840 --> 15:18.600
His name's Maksim.

15:20.320 --> 15:21.320
Maksim?

15:23.200 --> 15:25.680
And what does Maksim want for a reward?

15:25.840 --> 15:28.560
-I didn't do it for any reward, sir.
-Okay.

15:29.080 --> 15:31.520
-Let's go home.
-Wait, he does want something.

15:32.680 --> 15:34.280
Of course he does.  What do you want?

15:38.080 --> 15:41.400
I ask you, as a man, as a warrior,

15:41.800 --> 15:44.760
Come to Tukhlia far village meeting
under the next full moon.

15:45.080 --> 15:48.200
Locals would like to address their concerns.

15:49.360 --> 15:51.360
Why would I come to a
commoners gathering?

15:51.520 --> 15:53.680
We're free people just like you.

15:54.440 --> 15:56.960
If you think you and your men are in the right,
then come and prove it.

15:57.240 --> 15:58.960
There's no need to hide.

16:04.760 --> 16:07.320
I don't have time for you, you insolent little bastard.

16:07.480 --> 16:08.560
Father!

16:13.200 --> 16:15.320
I'll come to your peaseants meeting,

16:16.120 --> 16:17.920
because I choose to.

16:18.880 --> 16:19.840
Now.

16:21.320 --> 16:23.840
The hunt is over.  Home.

16:34.120 --> 16:36.840
Sometimes I think God gave me a son.

16:38.680 --> 16:39.680
Gard.

16:51.760 --> 16:54.360
Seems like a lot of trouble just to impress a girl.

16:55.480 --> 16:56.480
but well done.

17:11.960 --> 17:14.880
Where in God's name do you think you're going, young lady?

17:15.520 --> 17:17.040
I wanted to pick some berries.

17:17.920 --> 17:20.040
We have servants to do that.

17:20.839 --> 17:22.760
I wanted to pick them myself.

17:23.160 --> 17:24.680
Absoutely not.

17:25.480 --> 17:27.680
You never let me go anywhere.

17:28.118 --> 17:31.160
I've never even been to
Tukhlia, I think they call it.

17:31.600 --> 17:33.680
Those people aren't what you make them out.

17:36.560 --> 17:37.720
Myro.

17:39.280 --> 17:43.200
Those people are fighting me for our lands.

17:43.600 --> 17:44.960
They give me no respect.

17:45.480 --> 17:47.760
And if you turn your back on these people,

17:48.400 --> 17:51.680
-They'll stick a knife in it.
"Then why did one of them save me?"

17:56.720 --> 17:59.440
No daughter of mine will be picking berries!

18:00.320 --> 18:03.320
Now, you find yourselt another leisurely activity!

18:06.600 --> 18:08.000
To bed, young lady

18:09.680 --> 18:10.680
To bed.

18:17.960 --> 18:19.000
I love you

18:45.360 --> 18:47.600
No no no no!  It's me, Maksim!

18:48.280 --> 18:49.400
I'm sorry, Myroslava.

18:49.560 --> 18:52.760
Are you out of your mind?
My hear just leaped out of my chest!

18:53.000 --> 18:55.600
I didn't know how else to get past your servants.

18:55.880 --> 18:57.560
Get down.

19:01.440 --> 19:03.200
Sorry, there was no other way in.

19:03.360 --> 19:07.240
-Myro! Are you all right, What happened?
Nothing!

19:09.200 --> 19:12.320
-I saw a rat!
-Well, Openthe door, the guards will take care of it.

19:13.320 --> 19:16.760
No, no, no, it's gone now!
I'm going to bed! Goodnight!

19:16.920 --> 19:19.160
-Are you sure you'r okay? -Yes, I'm sure!

19:20.640 --> 19:22.640
-Goodnight. -Goodnight!

19:24.000 --> 19:27.680
-What are you doing here?
-I came to invite you to the festivities.

19:28.200 --> 19:29.280
Tonight.

19:29.920 --> 19:31.400
-Festivities? -Yes.

19:31.560 --> 19:35.840
It's a great celebration for Perun.
It's the biggest festival we have.

19:36.240 --> 19:38.520
There'll be singing and dancing

19:38.800 --> 19:41.360
and lots of barley sprit and delicious food.

19:41.920 --> 19:44.080
And there's this massive fire that...

19:44.440 --> 19:48.560
You have to see it to believe it, but you
can see it from all the way across the valley.

19:50.160 --> 19:53.280
You foolishly snuck into my room to invite
me to this?.

19:57.600 --> 20:00.080
I don't know what I was thinking.

20:00.960 --> 20:02.880
I'm sorry to bother you.

20:05.960 --> 20:06.960
This dress okay?

20:09.600 --> 20:10.320
Yes.

20:12.960 --> 20:14.520
Now lose the blade.

20:15.960 --> 20:17.000
Okay.

20:17.720 --> 20:20.120
Okay?, as in you'll come?

20:22.040 --> 20:25.200
How do you expect to get us out of
here without my father seeing us?

21:35.400 --> 21:37.800
Mother father.  This is Myroslava.

21:38.480 --> 21:41.680
-Myroslava, this is my mother, Rada.
-Pleased to meet you.

21:42.080 --> 21:43.040
And you.

21:43.200 --> 21:45.760
- You're very welcome here.
-Thank you.

21:46.160 --> 21:50.120
-And this is my father, Zakhar.
-Very pleased to meet you.

21:50.720 --> 21:52.240
Your son saved my life earliear.

21:52.400 --> 21:55.480
Well we have three things
to thank the gods for:

21:55.640 --> 21:58.920
Maksim's heroics,
the food we feast on

21:59.320 --> 22:01.760
-and your life.
-She killed the bear.

22:03.320 --> 22:07.360
-And this is uncle Korhun right here.
-It is a pleasure.

22:10.320 --> 22:11.480
She's very beautiful.

22:12.400 --> 22:16.680
Yes, she is very beautiful, Uncle Korhun.  Just like you, yes.

22:17.560 --> 22:19.880
Why don't you get some moew honey spirit?

22:20.480 --> 22:23.400
Yes, Honey spirit!  Where have they put it?

22:24.280 --> 22:27.080
My brother's around here somewhere.
Do you have siblings?

22:27.400 --> 22:28.800
I wish I did.

22:30.800 --> 22:32.000
look, there he is.

22:32.880 --> 22:34.640
I remember seeing him at the bear hunt.

22:36.040 --> 22:38.520
He roughes me at times but he means well.

22:38.680 --> 22:41.080
I don't know what I would do without him, to be honest.

22:45.720 --> 22:49.440
This reminds me of a party my father
threw for my mother when I was little.

22:49.600 --> 22:51.800
Everyone was singing and dancing.

22:52.080 --> 22:53.920
My parents must have danced all night.

22:54.080 --> 22:57.880
My mother had this white gown on and flowers in her hair.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.400
What happened to her?

23:05.200 --> 23:06.480
I'm sorry.

23:06.920 --> 23:11.200
No, No, it;s all right. I didn't mean
to make anything uncomfortable.

23:11.360 --> 23:11.800
And did you??

23:13.200 --> 23:13.880
Did I what?

23:15.480 --> 23:16.320
Learn to dance.

23:19.840 --> 23:20.840
Come on.

23:32.240 --> 23:33.240
Look.

23:45.200 --> 23:48.320
-Are you enjoying the evening?
-Very much.

24:05.160 --> 24:06.800
Be kind to my boy.

24:24.880 --> 24:25.880
It's beautiful.

24:27.120 --> 24:29.160
Those are gifts to our guardian.

24:29.640 --> 24:31.840
The Sentinel Rock, see?

24:34.400 --> 24:37.600
-It's actually a giant that protects our valley.
-A giant?

24:38.440 --> 24:41.080
-That's what the legend says.
-What's the legend?

24:41.960 --> 24:43.720
Well, long ago,

24:44.120 --> 24:46.800
When kind and wise giants roamed these lands,

24:47.280 --> 24:50.400
The goddess of death,
Morana, cursed it.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.840
She made everything in the water die

24:54.200 --> 24:56.240
and the whole area around it completely lifeless.

24:56.720 --> 24:58.520
No animals, no trees...

24:59.320 --> 25:01.120
Just bare rocks.

25:01.560 --> 25:04.160
And the mighty king of giants, saw this,

25:04.320 --> 25:06.600
And he took his huge mallet and dealth the rocky basin

25:06.760 --> 25:11.280
a massive blow that cracked its walls and broke the evil spell.

25:11.960 --> 25:13.600
And the whole area came alive at once.

25:14.800 --> 25:17.160
Needless to say, Morana was furious.

25:18.120 --> 25:20.600
And she let out this piercing scream

25:21.040 --> 25:24.200
and turned the king
of giants into stone.

25:25.160 --> 25:27.480
But, no matter how hard she tried or what she did,

25:27.720 --> 25:30.720
She could never reverse all the
beautiful life that had blossomed.

25:32.560 --> 25:35.520
That's my ancestors chose to live here.

25:38.400 --> 25:39.920
I can envisage it.

25:42.400 --> 25:44.680
And if Morana should ever return,

25:44.960 --> 25:46.840
Well, the king would awaken from his slumber

25:47.000 --> 25:49.680
and protect us from her evil wraith once again.

25:50.880 --> 25:53.600
You have so much love for this place.

25:54.320 --> 25:55.840
I can see why.

26:03.240 --> 26:04.400
I have to get back.

26:44.840 --> 26:46.400
You can eat for days.

26:47.360 --> 26:49.080
- Eat the bread before it goes stale.
- I will.

26:49.400 --> 26:51.200
It was good to see you, Uncle Korhun.

26:51.360 --> 26:54.200
Safe travels back to your village.
Good luck with your sister.

26:54.360 --> 26:56.840
You know how she likes to talk on these journeys.

26:57.160 --> 26:58.400
I heard that.

26:58.960 --> 27:00.240
Don't worry.

27:00.400 --> 27:03.760
I have plenty of honey spirit
to soothe my ears.

27:04.200 --> 27:07.200
Good. To see all of you!

27:07.640 --> 27:09.920
Oosta. Have you seen Maksim?

27:10.520 --> 27:11.800
Here he comes now.

27:20.960 --> 27:24.960
-Mother, I'm sorry that I'm late.
-I take it you had a good night.

27:25.720 --> 27:27.800
-Buchon, say goodbye to your mother.

27:30.440 --> 27:31.480
Goodbye my love.

27:31.640 --> 27:34.040
-Send along my greetings.

27:41.040 --> 27:43.080
-Take care of your brother.
-I will.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.200
Travel safe.

27:47.120 --> 27:48.200
I'll see you soon.

27:51.960 --> 27:52.920
Goodbye.

27:56.800 --> 27:57.760
Yeah?

27:59.920 --> 28:00.920
What, what?

28:03.200 --> 28:06.160
Oh yeah, yeah.  Hunt.  Yes, yes, yes we'll go.

28:06.680 --> 28:07.880
We'll go.  Yeah.

28:08.240 --> 28:09.240
Yes.

28:24.520 --> 28:26.000
No, I'm not hungry.

28:34.840 --> 28:36.080
Its busy.

28:36.880 --> 28:37.920
Busy.

28:38.200 --> 28:41.040
Yes, busy entertaining a new lady.

29:09.680 --> 29:11.720
There's nothing there.  Come on.

29:19.560 --> 29:22.000
Oosta, Oosta!  Stop!  What are you doing?
266
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,040
It's me, Maksim.

29:24.480 --> 29:25.960
It's all right.

29:26.120 --> 29:28.160
-Maksim. -Yes, it's me.

29:29.400 --> 29:31.600
-It's all right. -You're all right.
You're safe.

29:31.760 --> 29:32.920
What happened?

29:34.360 --> 29:35.760
Demons.

29:36.200 --> 29:38.840
Demons on horses.

29:40.200 --> 29:41.640
What do you mean demons?  What happened to the others?

29:41.800 --> 29:44.000
When we arrived to Korhun's village,

29:44.920 --> 29:48.360
They burnt it to the ground.  There's nothing left.

29:48.840 --> 29:50.400
I barely escaped

29:50.680 --> 29:54.840
And I didn't see what happened
to your mother or your son. I'm sorry.

29:57.560 --> 29:59.720
Do you think you can make it back to Tukhlia?

30:00.920 --> 30:04.880
Go. Findand our father and tell him what
you told us, understand?

30:05.880 --> 30:06.880
Go. Now

30:07.360 --> 30:08.200
Go.

31:01.600 --> 31:02.680
Uncle Korhun!

31:02.960 --> 31:03.960
Ivan!

31:11.120 --> 31:12.320
Your mother.

31:13.440 --> 31:14.240
Rosanna.

31:15.200 --> 31:17.760
-They tok....
-Who? Who took them?

31:49.120 --> 31:51.720
No. There's no time to bury the bodies.

31:53.880 --> 31:55.760
The gods will understand.

32:21.320 --> 32:23.600
-What are we waiting for?
-Be patient.

32:23.960 --> 32:27.840
There are two guards patrolling the perimeter.
We'll go in from the east.

32:28.960 --> 32:30.360
Blades only.

32:34.600 --> 32:36.120
Quickly and quitely.

32:53.720 --> 32:56.200
Go on. Take your pick.

32:57.240 --> 32:59.600
Who's gonna die?  You?  Me?

33:00.640 --> 33:02.760
Me next, huh?  Me next.

33:04.040 --> 33:08.080
Don't be scared. I've already died before.
You only get to it once or twice.

33:12.040 --> 33:13.760
It's you, it's you.

33:14.680 --> 33:18.080
Oh, you beat me.  You won, you won.
Well done. Nice one

33:20.520 --> 33:23.160
Go on, little man.  Hurry up  Let's go.

33:27.120 --> 33:28.520
Leave them alone.

33:28.960 --> 33:31.480
-Rosanna, protect the others.
-It's your turn!

33:31.800 --> 33:32.840
-Don't touch me! -No!

33:33.520 --> 33:36.160
-Rada! Stop, please, please!
-Shut up.

33:36.400 --> 33:37.480
Please!

33:38.080 --> 33:40.360
-Shut up!
-We didn't do anything!

33:44.040 --> 33:46.000
Maksim, you go after Mother.

33:47.120 --> 33:49.400
Petro and I will help the others.

33:50.440 --> 33:51.240
Go.

34:11.679 --> 34:12.480
Come on.

34:50.520 --> 34:51.520
Come here.

34:52.040 --> 34:52.880
Come.

35:06.680 --> 35:09.120
Oi, I'll give you a challenge!  Huh?

35:09.560 --> 35:11.520
I wanna tell you something.

35:18.560 --> 35:19.720
Huh, Do you like a challenge?

35:19.880 --> 35:22.920
All you mongrels have tried
to kill me and you've all failed.

35:23.080 --> 35:25.520
You could be the one.  You could be lucky.

35:33.000 --> 35:34.040
Hurry, Petro.

35:34.200 --> 35:36.680
Come on, take a challenge!  Kill me first!

35:36.840 --> 35:37.800
Kill me!

35:39.640 --> 35:41.360
Do it!  Come on!

35:47.400 --> 35:50.240
It's weak to kill a woman first!
It's weak!

35:50.400 --> 35:51.840
Be a man!

35:52.000 --> 35:54.200
Go with Petro and get them all to safety.

35:54.760 --> 35:55.640
Go.

35:56.240 --> 35:57.920
Take it!  Take it!

35:58.280 --> 36:00.320
Take it!  Take it!

36:00.480 --> 36:02.320
Go on!  Do it!

36:06.240 --> 36:09.280
-Mother. Don't worry, we're here.
-Come on, help me.

36:09.440 --> 36:10.840
Come on, give me a hand.
come on.

36:12.120 --> 36:13.640
-You're good?
-Come on, get me.

36:13.800 --> 36:16.320
-Thank you. -Here, huh.
Here! Come on!

36:18.760 --> 36:19.680
No!

36:40.760 --> 36:43.520
-Mother, are you all right?
-You need to get the others.

36:43.680 --> 36:45.800
-Come on!
-We already done it, they are with Petro.

36:45.960 --> 36:48.160
-You took your time. Come on. 
-Shut up!

36:48.480 --> 36:49.040
Maksim.

36:50.120 --> 36:51.120
Go!

37:16.640 --> 37:18.120
-Let me see. 
-No!

37:18.560 --> 37:20.560
We don't any time, we need to go.

37:20.720 --> 37:23.960
Take mother back the way we came.
I will buy you some time. Go.

37:24.360 --> 37:26.480
-Meet us in the caves. 
-Go.

37:27.040 --> 37:28.600
-I'm with you.

37:39.280 --> 37:40.520
We're almost there.

37:42.240 --> 37:43.320
Keep going.

37:44.240 --> 37:46.280
Go be with my family.  I'll be right behind you.

38:05.520 --> 38:06.560
Hey, Let's go!

38:48.240 --> 38:49.680
What are you doing?

38:50.240 --> 38:51.760
I'm gonna get me some Mongols.

38:52.040 --> 38:54.760
What do you mean?  get you some mongols. There are too many of them.  It's suicide.

38:54.920 --> 38:57.520
I... Don't... Care.

38:58.240 --> 39:01.080
This is unfinished business.

39:01.240 --> 39:03.520
If you go out there,
you compromise everyone in this cave.

39:03.680 --> 39:05.800
-Why should that stop me?. 
-Please.

39:06.400 --> 39:09.400
Maksim, hurry, it's your mother.  Come.

39:30.240 --> 39:31.240
Maksim.

39:35.680 --> 39:36.560
What happened?

39:37.400 --> 39:39.200
I can't stop the bleeding.

41:41.600 --> 41:44.280
When we arrived he was already dead.

41:45.560 --> 41:46.680
Sorry,

41:47.560 --> 41:48.560
my Khan.

42:15.280 --> 42:16.280
Leave me.

44:16.360 --> 44:17.680
Do you smell that?

44:18.320 --> 44:20.080
The stench of pagan swine.

44:40.560 --> 44:42.880
People of Tukhlia,

44:45.040 --> 44:47.520
I have come here today, NOT...

44:49.000 --> 44:51.040
because you called me.

44:52.040 --> 44:53.360
I have come here,

44:54.000 --> 44:57.640
-for my own accord. 
- Nevertheless, we appreciate your arrival.

45:05.000 --> 45:07.520
I'd say, It's good to see you, Zakhar,

45:08.480 --> 45:11.280
but we both know that it would be a lie.

45:12.160 --> 45:13.560
Yes, it would be.

45:15.040 --> 45:17.160
Look here, this is the deed

45:17.840 --> 45:19.720
that appoints me your leader.

45:20.240 --> 45:22.760
and therefore of all these lands.

45:23.000 --> 45:26.160
Do you believe that parchment
makes us respect you?

45:27.120 --> 45:30.640
You are forcing us into an
agreement that we had no say in.

45:31.280 --> 45:34.520
Do younot think it's wrong
that, without asking your permission,

45:35.040 --> 45:39.200
I take that sword of yours and give it to my sons?

45:41.640 --> 45:45.200
The Mongol army
is bearing down on us.

45:48.800 --> 45:49.720
I'm here

45:50.720 --> 45:52.440
to protect your people

45:53.800 --> 45:56.760
in a way that you could not protect your own wife.

45:59.880 --> 46:03.040
I'll leave you to your own fate.

46:03.360 --> 46:05.120
and to the Mongol hordes.

46:05.280 --> 46:07.760
-Let's go. 
-Let the gods decide.

46:12.880 --> 46:14.160
If you win,

46:14.880 --> 46:18.480
you can stay in Tukhlia
and we will follow your rule.

46:23.360 --> 46:24.720
You'll follow my rule.

46:25.480 --> 46:26.720
But also...

46:28.520 --> 46:29.920
your sons...

46:32.200 --> 46:34.960
your sons will serve in my house.

46:40.000 --> 46:41.520
But when we win,

46:42.240 --> 46:44.920
you will go to Gallich to gather your men

46:45.400 --> 46:47.720
to fight shoulder to shoulder with us

46:47.880 --> 46:50.240
against the Mongols, as equals.

46:51.680 --> 46:52.760
Agreed?

47:05.320 --> 47:06.320
Agreed.

47:07.440 --> 47:08.440
Gard!

47:13.640 --> 47:16.800
Father, I know you want to choose
Ivan, but please pick me.

47:35.560 --> 47:39.000
-Are you sure about this?
-Let the gods decide.

48:02.640 --> 48:05.320
Stay low.  Use his size against him.

49:56.320 --> 49:57.480
It's settled then.

50:01.320 --> 50:04.120
Nothing is settled.

50:05.400 --> 50:10.600
I have spilt blood throught these in over 20 battles.

50:11.440 --> 50:15.960
And you think I am going to honour a commoner's agreement?

50:21.440 --> 50:25.400
The warrior I once knew would not date to lose his honour.

50:26.880 --> 50:28.680
Are you a liar?

50:29.240 --> 50:30.960
And a coward?

50:33.400 --> 50:38.800
The warrior that I knew wouldn't have been scrathing the dirt and shit
spend the day cleaning shit

50:38.960 --> 50:40.760
like some farmer!

50:42.160 --> 50:44.480
I'll bring your army from Gallich

50:45.880 --> 50:48.960
and we will fight shoulder to shoulder.

50:50.080 --> 50:53.280
If you still can, old man.

50:55.520 --> 50:56.840
Get up!

50:59.640 --> 51:01.000
Thank you.

51:03.600 --> 51:05.120
Gather supplies!

51:05.880 --> 51:08.920
And you'll not thieve from all my lands!

51:11.440 --> 51:13.600
It wasn't as impressive
as defeating a bear

51:13.760 --> 51:15.800
but you didn't have my help.

51:17.320 --> 51:19.520
-You've been here the entire time.
-Yes.

51:22.560 --> 51:24.560
I heard about your mother.

51:25.320 --> 51:26.560
I'm so sorry.

51:28.480 --> 51:30.280
I'm grateful you got to meet her.

51:32.520 --> 51:34.080
Your mother was like mine.

51:35.680 --> 51:36.680
Kind

51:37.680 --> 51:39.080
and sweet.

51:41.000 --> 51:42.560
Bring me the horse!

51:44.680 --> 51:47.480
I should go before my father sees me.

51:49.640 --> 51:51.040
I will see you soon.

51:59.320 --> 52:00.920
For all we know,

52:01.160 --> 52:06.080
the safest path in the
west is here or here.

52:07.320 --> 52:09.960
We are short of supplies
and reinforcements.

52:10.720 --> 52:13.600
The mountainous area is difficult

52:13.840 --> 52:17.120
to cross for us.

52:17.920 --> 52:18.920
However,

52:19.880 --> 52:23.800
if we cross the valley,
we will not find resistance.

52:39.680 --> 52:42.120
We believe that the amulet proceeds

52:43.040 --> 52:44.800
from one of the towns

52:45.520 --> 52:47.960
from the mountainside.

52:54.280 --> 52:55.320
We will cross...

52:56.520 --> 52:57.960
the mountains.

53:00.040 --> 53:02.240
-Merke. -Yes, my Khan.

53:02.720 --> 53:04.440
Recruit your men.

53:04.960 --> 53:07.000
Register those towns.

53:07.640 --> 53:09.240
Find the one responsible.

53:26.440 --> 53:28.080
Tugar Volk.

53:57.000 --> 53:59.240
-What happened?
-The Mongols are approaching.

53:59.400 --> 54:02.880
Tugar Volk and Myroslava are resisting,
but they don't have long.

54:03.040 --> 54:05.720
-How many? -About twenty.
Maybe less.

54:06.520 --> 54:08.600
-Myroslava.
-Get your brother and go.

54:22.840 --> 54:24.480
Where is everyone?

54:25.320 --> 54:28.600
They were here when I left.
They must be inside.

56:16.160 --> 56:19.360
-Ivan! There's toooo many!
-Go to the house!

56:20.400 --> 56:21.880
Inside, quickly!, quickly!

56:23.840 --> 56:24.760
To the house!

56:38.880 --> 56:40.360
Bohun, stop!  Calm down!

56:44.440 --> 56:47.000
Find cover! Maksim get yourself to the windows!

56:50.120 --> 56:52.160
At least we got comfortable benches to de on then.

57:26.280 --> 57:27.280
Listen to me!

57:29.280 --> 57:32.120
You are warriors!  And you have proven yourselves!

57:34.160 --> 57:38.440
But you have taken the life of the Khan's only son!

57:42.280 --> 57:43.360
He will never stop...

57:44.640 --> 57:46.440
until you'r dead.

57:48.600 --> 57:49.760
Sacrifice yourselves...

57:53.320 --> 57:55.600
and you will save your families.

57:57.120 --> 58:00.320
I beg you.  This is futile.

58:03.840 --> 58:05.760
And I swear to you...

58:07.360 --> 58:09.640
I will protect the people of Tukhlia.

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
Meet your death, traitor!

58:18.960 --> 58:20.120
Burn them.

58:33.400 --> 58:34.800
They're gonna smoke us out.

58:49.760 --> 58:53.560
Hey,the wind is in our favor.
We use the smoke as cover and attack them straight on.

58:55.480 --> 58:57.040
Maksim's right.

58:57.720 --> 58:58.720
Get ready.

01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:06.280
-What are you doing? Your one of us!
-I am not one of you, peasants.

01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:52.560
Die bastard!

01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:44.000
Stop! That's enough

01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:48.920
 For, you and your men are Tukhlian.
Fight beside us.

01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:01.400
Maksim.

01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:05.760
Maksim!

01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:09.880
Are you hurt?

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.480
Hey!, your ax.

01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:24.280
Come on.

01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:07.320
Maksim, no!

01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:17.840
My special arrows.

01:03:57.400 --> 01:03:59.800
Go for those men!  Kill them!

01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:03.520
Get them.

01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:09.280
Take the archers.

01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:12.760
-Bring the heads of those assassins.
-Yes, my Khan.

01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:14.040
Follow me!

01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:35.080
Shoot!

01:04:58.520 --> 01:04:59.600
Halt!

01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:16.760
We have killed most of them, my Khan.

01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:19.600
And the two brothers?

01:05:30.120 --> 01:05:34.280
I will bring my entire army to the
top of the Carpathian Mountains.

01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:38.560
I will burn everything that is valuable to you.

01:05:39.960 --> 01:05:41.800
You will guide me.

01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:44.920
So maybe it won't end
your miserable life.

01:05:55.920 --> 01:05:57.320
My child.

01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:18.800
Tugar Volk is allied with the Mongols.

01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:21.720
-They won't be far behind.
-Ivan!

01:06:21.880 --> 01:06:24.160
Quick!  Bring him into the house.

01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:53.760
He's been struck by some kind of poison.

01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:04.960
Rosanna, Bochan.

01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:07.480
Petro, Rosanna, Bochan.  Go, go go!

01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:20.000
My wife.

01:07:21.680 --> 01:07:23.360
I'm so sorry, my son.

01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:25.840
It's all right, father.

01:07:28.840 --> 01:07:30.920
The gods welcome me.

01:07:41.840 --> 01:07:43.880
It's been an honor, little brother.

01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:46.520
Live your life.

01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:50.920
It's your time.

01:07:57.760 --> 01:07:59.120
What happened?

01:08:03.720 --> 01:08:04.560
Ivan.

01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:07.960
No, no.

01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:11.000
It's all right, my love.

01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:14.160
-It's all right. 
-I'm here.

01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:16.160
I'm here.

01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:18.160
I'm not leaving

01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:20.960
-Please. 
-I promise...

01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:23.880
I will see you again...

01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:26.479
in the next world.

01:08:31.479 --> 01:08:32.479
Bochan.

01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:43.640
Don't cry, my son.

01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:45.760
Don't Cry.

01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:49.120
Be strong.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:59.120
Protect your mother and our family.

01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:03.720
Nothing is more important.

01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:12.359
It's all right.

01:09:14.479 --> 01:09:16.479
I'll always be watching over you.

01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:07.200
-Maksim, wait. 
-How?!

01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:11.080
How could you live your entire life
and not know what your father truely is ?

01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:13.640
How am I supposed to trust you?

01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:21.040
Years ago, there was a man who came 
to our house in Gallich.

01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:24.080
He scared my father in a way, 
I'd never seen before.

01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:28.080
I couldn't understand it at the time, but today,

01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:31.560
When I smelt his horrid stench in my home. I knew

01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:33.840
I knew it was him.

01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:36.400
Burunda Khan.

01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:43.080
Our mothers deserve more.

01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:20.320
My brother would have
wanted you to have this.

01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:22.160
He was a man of honor.

01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:25.760
I don't want what happened to my family to happen to yours.

01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:27.000
You have done enough.

01:11:27.160 --> 01:11:29.600
Your family needs you.  Go home.

01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:30.760
Home?

01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:33.720
I don't have a home.

01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:37.000
My beautiful wife

01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:40.040
and my seven year old daughter,

01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:43.320
are already dining with the gods.

01:11:44.440 --> 01:11:47.200
So before I join my family,

01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:51.640
I will make this right.

01:11:55.560 --> 01:11:57.920
We will make this right.

01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:07.160
My dear fellow villagers

01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:09.560
and respected neighbors.

01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:12.560
There is very little time,

01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:16.040
our scouts have confirmed

01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:18.960
that the entire Mongol
army rides towards us.

01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:24.400
They won't stop until they have 
murdered every last one of us.

01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:26.640
They outnumber us by the thousands!

01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:28.680
We have to run!

01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:31.080
This is the only way we can survive.

01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:35.560
Even if we left right now, 
their horses would catch up to us.

01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:37.000
And then what?

01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:40.000
I have a possible solution.

01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:42.680
We can take everything

01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:46.400
and leave Tukhlia through the
back side of the mountain.

01:12:46.680 --> 01:12:49.480
And once we have all passed through,

01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:54.200
we will tear down the Sentinel Rock

01:12:56.200 --> 01:12:57.640
break the dam

01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:03.240
and create a river barrier
between us and the Mongols.

01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:06.880
And how will we create enough time?
Their already too close.

01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:11.120
A group of us will hold them off.

01:13:13.480 --> 01:13:15.760
The entrance to Tukhlia is narrow.

01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:19.360
If we gather all of our
fighters at this main point,

01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:21.680
we can hold off the entire mongol army

01:13:21.840 --> 01:13:24.960
and make time for
the rest of you to escape.

01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:26.320
Now you must choose.

01:13:26.840 --> 01:13:30.440
Abandon the person next to you 
and save only yourself

01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:33.840
or do we unite as one and protect each other

01:13:34.680 --> 01:13:37.760
and fight for something meaningful.

01:13:42.240 --> 01:13:44.440
-We fight! 
-We fight!

01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:47.200
We fight!

01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:52.160
-We fight! 
-We fight!

01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:55.120
-We fight! 
-We fight!

01:15:02.360 --> 01:15:03.800
I never did thank you.

01:15:04.920 --> 01:15:05.920
For what?

01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:08.960
Saving my life.

01:15:09.680 --> 01:15:11.080
The second time.

01:15:13.240 --> 01:15:15.400
I don't believe you thanked me for the first.

01:15:17.320 --> 01:15:18.320
That's true.

01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:21.080
Thank you.

01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:28.560
Myro,

01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:32.160
From the moment I first saw you...

01:17:01.960 --> 01:17:04.920
It is a privilege to dying honorably.

01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:10.120
And if we are to die today,
we die like warriors.

01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:15.440
-I would gladly die for you. 
-Yes!

01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:18.280
On my command!

01:17:21.200 --> 01:17:22.120
Pull!

01:17:46.880 --> 01:17:48.960
Tear those assassins apart!

01:17:49.400 --> 01:17:50.880
Take position!

01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:10.440
Shoot!

01:20:08.240 --> 01:20:09.360
Withdraw!

01:20:16.720 --> 01:20:18.120
Bohun.  Bohun!

01:20:18.600 --> 01:20:20.360
-Did we win yet?
-You're good?

01:20:20.720 --> 01:20:23.880
I thought you were dead.
You didn't think those little mongels could have hurt me?

01:20:48.320 --> 01:20:49.320
My Khan!

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.920
Each villager fights
with the energy of ten.

01:20:53.880 --> 01:20:56.480
We must modify the plan and
withdraw from the mountain.

01:21:11.160 --> 01:21:12.080
Here.

01:21:17.720 --> 01:21:19.440
Take command.

01:21:19.880 --> 01:21:23.400
I want to destroy
that town before dark.

01:21:41.880 --> 01:21:44.080
-We...We're ready.
-Tell the others.

01:21:44.240 --> 01:21:46.080
We'll prepare the dam.

01:21:58.520 --> 01:22:01.920
The last villager has left Tukhlia!
We are ready!

01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:03.280
Maksim!

01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:05.640
Go!, Go!

01:22:48.840 --> 01:22:50.600
Take her.  Go.

01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:51.340
Go.

01:22:52.280 --> 01:22:54.320
Please, Go!

01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:21.640
Destroy the dam.

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:26.960
All right.  Gather yourselves boys.

01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:28.280
For Maksim!

01:24:57.480 --> 01:24:59.720
I will find your loved ones

01:25:00.760 --> 01:25:03.720
and you will see me butcher
them as if they were cattle.

01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:05.640
And so,

01:25:06.120 --> 01:25:09.320
you and I will share the same pain.

01:25:11.240 --> 01:25:12.240
Merke,

01:25:12.920 --> 01:25:14.200
Burn it all!

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:45.680
Take my personal
guard and go ahead.

01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:48.440
Find out how many villagers are left.

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:09.800
Pull!

01:26:19.360 --> 01:26:20.320
Pull!

01:26:25.960 --> 01:26:29.480
Don't let those villagers pull down that rock.

01:26:30.120 --> 01:26:31.320
Kill them!

01:26:58.640 --> 01:26:59.680
Pull!

01:27:14.840 --> 01:27:15.440
Pull!

01:27:38.160 --> 01:27:39.280
I'll be back.

01:31:43.320 --> 01:31:44.320
The rock!  Go!

01:32:08.640 --> 01:32:09.680
Come!

01:33:15.440 --> 01:33:17.160
YOU DID THIS!

01:33:18.080 --> 01:33:19.080
Wait!

01:33:24.800 --> 01:33:25.800
Above.

01:33:29.240 --> 01:33:30.240
Zakhar!

01:33:30.640 --> 01:33:32.720
You want safe passage.

01:33:34.480 --> 01:33:36.240
I will spare your son.

01:33:48.760 --> 01:33:50.760
Myroslava, hand me your bow.

01:34:05.640 --> 01:34:06.720
Kill him!

01:37:55.200 --> 01:37:56.200
Father!

01:38:00.320 --> 01:38:02.400
-Father. 
-Son, I knew...

01:38:03.600 --> 01:38:06.280
-you would make it.
-Save your breath.

01:38:06.760 --> 01:38:08.480
Our people are safe.

01:38:10.680 --> 01:38:13.080
Your mother would be so proud of you.

01:38:20.760 --> 01:38:22.160
I am, as well.

01:38:26.240 --> 01:38:27.240
Myroslava,

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:32.840
Look after my son.

01:38:57.960 --> 01:38:59.920
Mother and Ivan are waiting for you.

01:39:02.529 --> 01:39:07.529
