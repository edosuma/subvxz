WEBVTT

00:02.002 --> 00:03.804
Hi, sweetie, it's me, Daddy.
Fun Daddy.

00:03.837 --> 00:06.407
I mean, Daddy David is fun, too,
but he's more fun in

00:06.440 --> 00:09.143
a "Let's go to the library
and look at maps" kind of way.

00:09.177 --> 00:10.578
Anyway, it's about 6:00,

00:10.611 --> 00:13.314
and I was thinking
once you arrive,

00:13.347 --> 00:16.650
this will probably be about the
time that you go nighty-night.

00:16.684 --> 00:20.654
And I've always had this dream
about tucking my baby in.

00:20.688 --> 00:23.757
So, if you were here,
I would say:

00:23.791 --> 00:25.693
Now I lay me down to sleep.

00:25.726 --> 00:27.995
I pray the Lord
my soul to keep,

00:28.028 --> 00:30.664
but if I die before I wake...

00:30.698 --> 00:33.000
It's probably due to
a huge earthquake.
(laughs)

00:33.033 --> 00:34.768
That is downright
disrespectful.

00:34.802 --> 00:36.870
Bedtime prayers
are a serious thing.

00:36.904 --> 00:38.038
It's your last
words to God

00:38.072 --> 00:40.174
before He holds your soul
for the night.

00:40.208 --> 00:41.775
That's what I tell
my goddaughter.

00:41.809 --> 00:42.776
You have a goddaughter?

00:42.810 --> 00:43.844
Why is that so surprising?

00:43.877 --> 00:46.013
I don't know.
You just don't really seem

00:46.046 --> 00:48.349
like the godparent type,
what with all the anger

00:48.382 --> 00:49.950
and the cursing
and the binge drinking.

00:49.983 --> 00:51.018
Well, that's on the outside.

00:51.051 --> 00:52.386
But on the inside,

00:52.420 --> 00:54.855
I have a very evolved
spirituality.

00:54.888 --> 00:56.690
The Jew in the room
has a question.

00:56.724 --> 00:58.692
What exactly is a godparent?

00:58.726 --> 01:00.228
I mean, I've heard of it,

01:00.261 --> 01:02.029
but I don't quite understand
what they do.

01:02.062 --> 01:03.364
It's mostly about rides
to the airport, right?

01:03.397 --> 01:06.234
Oh, no. No, it's the person
who raises your kid

01:06.267 --> 01:08.035
if something really bad
happens to you,

01:08.068 --> 01:09.603
like you die in a car crash

01:09.637 --> 01:10.971
or on the toilet, like Elvis.

01:11.004 --> 01:12.206
No. (chuckles)

01:12.240 --> 01:13.307
That's a guardian.

01:13.341 --> 01:14.708
A godparent is someone

01:14.742 --> 01:16.644
the child goes to
for spiritual guidance.

01:16.677 --> 01:19.046
Like I do
for my goddaughter, Pam.

01:19.079 --> 01:20.414
Every Sunday after church,

01:20.448 --> 01:22.983
we reflect together
on the minister's sermon.

01:23.016 --> 01:25.719
Miss Rocky,
where do we go when we die?

01:25.753 --> 01:29.089
Oh, baby, that pretty little
soul of yours

01:29.123 --> 01:31.592
will most definitely
go up to the angels.

01:31.625 --> 01:34.395
But your body? It's gonna get
dumped in the ground

01:34.428 --> 01:35.896
and eaten by
worms and bugs.

01:35.929 --> 01:37.631
And then someone
will plant veggies,

01:37.665 --> 01:39.099
and they'll grow
from the bug poo.

01:39.133 --> 01:40.834
Now that potato
salad you eating?

01:40.868 --> 01:42.336
It's probably your granddaddy.

01:42.370 --> 01:44.172
Oh...

01:44.205 --> 01:47.408
Come on, baby.
Shake a little hot sauce on him.

01:47.441 --> 01:50.077
It's not a bad idea,
finding godparents.

01:50.110 --> 01:52.513
I have no spiritual advice
to offer.

01:52.546 --> 01:54.248
The only thing
I ever got from the church

01:54.282 --> 01:56.116
was a lifelong complex
about inferior abs.

01:57.718 --> 01:59.086
You stare at Jesus
throughout puberty.

01:59.119 --> 02:00.288
That guy was ripped.

02:02.456 --> 02:04.124
We need to find godparents.

02:07.127 --> 02:08.462
Hello, Goldie.
Hi, Shania.

02:08.496 --> 02:09.797
Nicotine gum?

02:09.830 --> 02:12.099
I'm pregnant.
I know.

02:12.132 --> 02:14.268
I just always feel obliged to
offer if people see I have some.

02:14.302 --> 02:15.869
Shania?
Good for you.

02:15.903 --> 02:17.438
Don't smoke
and don't text and drive.

02:17.471 --> 02:19.607
Hey, who is that
adorable smelly friend

02:19.640 --> 02:20.941
you brought into
my office

02:20.974 --> 02:22.610
instead of leaving it
anywhere but here?

02:22.643 --> 02:24.778
His name is Marshmallow.
He's our class guinea pig.

02:24.812 --> 02:25.979
It's a school project
to teach kids

02:26.013 --> 02:28.148
how to take care
of living things.

02:28.182 --> 02:29.550
It's also a way
to show my class

02:29.583 --> 02:30.984
what our family looks like.

02:31.018 --> 02:32.786
Will you take our
picture, Gary?
Oh, yeah.

02:32.820 --> 02:34.222
I'll be happy to.
But don't ever sleep with it.

02:34.255 --> 02:35.389
It'll poop right in your mouth.

02:35.423 --> 02:37.291
Okay, all right.

02:37.325 --> 02:39.293
Get together there.
Don't force it, Goldie.

02:39.327 --> 02:40.294
Here we go.

02:40.328 --> 02:41.962
Say Craigslist.
One, two, three!

02:41.995 --> 02:43.631
BOTH:
Craigslist.

02:43.664 --> 02:44.798
Boom. Great.

02:44.832 --> 02:46.967
So, Goldie, we like all
of our surrogates

02:47.000 --> 02:48.469
to pop in for little
mental health pit stops.

02:48.502 --> 02:49.637
How you doing?

02:49.670 --> 02:51.505
Great. Some morning sickness

02:51.539 --> 02:53.241
and a love-hate relationship
with nachos.

02:53.274 --> 02:54.675
(chuckles)
I hear that.
I love 'em, hate 'em.

02:54.708 --> 02:57.411
But Bryan and David
have been amazing.

02:57.445 --> 02:58.912
We've become
incredibly close.

02:58.946 --> 03:00.314
I love that you're feeling
connected to them,

03:00.348 --> 03:02.149
I really do, but
let me give you

03:02.182 --> 03:04.652
the 411 on Rule Number One
of Surrogacy 101.

03:04.685 --> 03:06.153
When you deliver David
and Bryan's baby,

03:06.186 --> 03:07.355
your job is complete.

03:07.388 --> 03:09.990
They get their child,
you get your money,

03:10.023 --> 03:11.759
and everybody goes
their separate ways.

03:11.792 --> 03:12.893
Gary, that's not true.

03:12.926 --> 03:14.662
Bryan and David would
never keep me away

03:14.695 --> 03:16.497
from my baby brother or sister.

03:16.530 --> 03:17.765
Oh, Shania, sweetie,

03:17.798 --> 03:19.199
this baby isn't
related to you.

03:19.233 --> 03:21.435
The doctor planted
another lady's egg in me

03:21.469 --> 03:23.103
that was fertilized
with David's sperm.

03:23.136 --> 03:25.005
Mom, this baby's growing
inside you.

03:25.038 --> 03:27.675
It's absorbing all your love
and niceness and yogurt.

03:27.708 --> 03:29.777
Plus, I talk to it
all the time in Spanish.

03:29.810 --> 03:31.178
It knows my voice.

03:31.211 --> 03:33.281
Crecer grande y fuerte,
ninito!

03:33.314 --> 03:35.783
I'm so sorry, sweetie, but
this baby isn't a part of us,

03:35.816 --> 03:38.018
even though it may
feel that way.

03:38.051 --> 03:39.853
I'm just a, a...

03:39.887 --> 03:42.723
a storage unit with legs.

03:42.756 --> 03:44.124
Beautifully said, Goldie.

03:45.459 --> 03:48.028
So do you know
what you're having yet?

03:48.061 --> 03:49.397
A boy, a girl?

03:49.430 --> 03:50.898
I think we're gonna
let gender be a surprise.

03:50.931 --> 03:52.566
As long as he or
she is healthy

03:52.600 --> 03:54.067
and willing to go
to Lakers games with me.

03:54.101 --> 03:56.370
So, with our baby coming,

03:56.404 --> 03:59.373
we have been talking
more and more about spirituality

03:59.407 --> 04:00.641
It got us thinking

04:00.674 --> 04:02.976
about your commitment
ceremony in Ojai,

04:03.010 --> 04:04.378
and how incredibly
moving it was.

04:04.412 --> 04:05.713
And you're one of
the few couples we know

04:05.746 --> 04:08.048
with a true spiritual
conviction.

04:08.081 --> 04:09.717
You know, that
actually practice.

04:09.750 --> 04:12.052
Everyone else we know
just goes to spin class.

04:12.085 --> 04:14.322
So, Tiffany, Victoria,

04:14.355 --> 04:17.157
Would you like to be
our child's godparents?

04:18.959 --> 04:20.394
Wow. That's...

04:20.428 --> 04:21.429
Godparents.

04:21.462 --> 04:22.430
We didn't even know

04:22.463 --> 04:24.064
you guys were believers.

04:24.097 --> 04:25.933
Oh, I'm not.
Religion requires faith,

04:25.966 --> 04:27.901
and I'm more
interested in facts.

04:27.935 --> 04:29.737
But, Bryan, you used
to go to church, right?

04:29.770 --> 04:32.440
Yeah, every Sunday, up
until, like, 15 years ago.

04:32.473 --> 04:33.741
And then...

04:33.774 --> 04:35.576
I don't know why
I stopped, exactly.

04:35.609 --> 04:37.077
Might have had something
to do with the fact

04:37.110 --> 04:38.979
that I just wanted to
test the rule about

04:39.012 --> 04:40.581
all-you-can-eat at
the Four Seasons brunch.

04:40.614 --> 04:42.416
But we still want
our baby

04:42.450 --> 04:43.684
to have a strong
spiritual connection,

04:43.717 --> 04:45.919
even if we can't
provide it.

04:45.953 --> 04:48.789
Look, it might be hard
for us to be a godparent

04:48.822 --> 04:51.124
to someone else's child
when we can't have
one of our own.

04:51.158 --> 04:53.193
Victoria has
a dented uterus,

04:53.226 --> 04:55.629
and my eggs are
practically powdered.

04:55.663 --> 04:56.630
Oh, we're so sorry.

04:56.664 --> 04:57.498
It's ironic, too.

04:57.531 --> 04:59.433
We have twice the
baby-making parts.

04:59.467 --> 05:01.034
We're failures
on an exponential level.

05:01.068 --> 05:03.036
Well, I mean,
there's always adoption.

05:03.070 --> 05:05.038
You say that like it's easy.

05:05.072 --> 05:07.608
We have spent the
last six years and
all of our money

05:07.641 --> 05:09.477
on a child that
we will never have.

05:09.510 --> 05:10.944
So forgive me if I can't

05:10.978 --> 05:13.614
get it up to raise
somebody else's kid.

05:13.647 --> 05:15.483
You know, or be
a spiritual beacon

05:15.516 --> 05:17.284
for yours when God
has just taken

05:17.317 --> 05:19.086
a divine dump
on my dream.

05:20.654 --> 05:25.092
But, you know, super touched
that you guys thought of us.

05:26.827 --> 05:28.462
Angry!
Ooh...

05:28.496 --> 05:29.963
Sad.
Mm...

05:29.997 --> 05:31.298
Happy.
Ee!

05:31.331 --> 05:32.966
Is that good?

05:33.000 --> 05:35.469
Okay, try to convey quirky
confidence because this is

05:35.503 --> 05:36.637
my tribute
to Annie Leibovitz.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.038
Is that the little girl
in your class

05:38.071 --> 05:39.039
Nana thinks runs the media?

05:39.072 --> 05:41.008
Let's go see Bryan and David.

05:41.041 --> 05:42.543
They always know
what I'm talking about.

05:42.576 --> 05:43.711
Maybe we should give
the guys a break.

05:43.744 --> 05:45.078
Make it a Mom, Shania,
Marshmallow weekend?

05:45.112 --> 05:47.314
If you want me
to fail the assignment.

05:47.347 --> 05:50.150
I'm supposed to take pictures
of Marshmallow with my family,

05:50.183 --> 05:51.652
and that includes Bryan
and David.

05:51.685 --> 05:52.986
I know Bryan and David feel

05:53.020 --> 05:55.656
like an important part
of our lives right now,

05:55.689 --> 05:56.824
but it's like Gary said...

05:56.857 --> 05:59.092
Gary at Expanding Families?
He's a freak.

05:59.126 --> 06:00.327
When you left
the room to pee,

06:00.360 --> 06:01.862
he asked me if I'd call

06:01.895 --> 06:03.397
his ex-boyfriend to see
if another man answered.

06:03.431 --> 06:06.667
I just don't want
you getting hurt.

06:06.700 --> 06:09.169
The boys will always be
a part of our lives. You'll see.

06:09.202 --> 06:11.171
I mean, Bryan and I
are identical souls.

06:11.204 --> 06:13.173
We have the exact
same take on everything.

06:13.206 --> 06:15.576
Get the cameraman!
Get the cameraman!
No, not the gazelle!

06:15.609 --> 06:17.210
No, no, the cameraman!
No, no, eat the cameraman!

06:17.244 --> 06:18.846
Get the cameraman!
Eat the fatty! He can't run!

06:18.879 --> 06:20.080
He's like three feet away!
Eat the fatty!
He can't run!

06:20.113 --> 06:22.015
BOTH:
Oh...

06:22.049 --> 06:24.251
Mom, I have faith
in Bryan and David.

06:24.284 --> 06:25.686
I believe
they really love us.

06:25.719 --> 06:28.121
Who are you gonna listen to:
Gary, a man who asked me

06:28.155 --> 06:30.390
to lend him two grand,
or your own heart?

06:34.962 --> 06:38.265
(Bryan and Shania chuckling)

06:38.298 --> 06:39.733
DAVID:
So cool.

06:39.767 --> 06:41.201
They actually look
like Polaroids.

06:41.234 --> 06:42.536
What are Polaroids?

06:42.570 --> 06:44.938
It's just an old-timey word
David likes to use.

06:44.972 --> 06:47.140
like "landline" or
"Josh Hartnett."

06:47.174 --> 06:49.376
Okay, honey, it's time
to hit the road.

06:49.409 --> 06:51.378
Aw, do we have to?
Uh-huh.

06:51.411 --> 06:53.213
It feels like we haven't
seen these guys in forever.

06:53.246 --> 06:54.448
I know, honey.
I'm sorry about that.

06:54.482 --> 06:56.550
But David and I are
on a noble quest.

06:56.584 --> 06:58.318
We're on the hunt
for godparents.

06:58.351 --> 06:59.553
Mom, do I have godparents?

06:59.587 --> 07:01.822
No, sweetie.
You know, I asked Nana

07:01.855 --> 07:03.123
when I was pregnant,
but she told me

07:03.156 --> 07:04.558
that if I took
an illegitimate child

07:04.592 --> 07:06.560
into a church, it would
be like killing Jesus twice.

07:06.594 --> 07:07.661
Sounds right.

07:07.695 --> 07:09.229
So, since I don't have
any godparents,

07:09.262 --> 07:10.898
maybe you guys
could be mine.

07:10.931 --> 07:13.801
Us? Oh, godparents?

07:13.834 --> 07:15.302
That's a pretty big
responsibility, Shania.

07:15.335 --> 07:17.304
BRYAN:
Yeah, and really
sweet, honey,

07:17.337 --> 07:18.739
but I'm afraid
we have to say no.

07:18.772 --> 07:20.908
No, no, no, it's just
that Bryan and I

07:20.941 --> 07:22.142
don't have a lot to offer

07:22.175 --> 07:23.911
in the whole spiritual
guidance department.

07:23.944 --> 07:26.747
Yeah, you really can't be
someone's godparent

07:26.780 --> 07:28.482
if you don't have spiritual
conviction of your own.

07:28.516 --> 07:30.751
No. It's okay. I get it.

07:30.784 --> 07:32.352
Okay.

07:32.385 --> 07:33.921
Oh...

07:33.954 --> 07:35.322
What was that?

07:35.355 --> 07:37.858
We met with Gary the other day,
and he told us

07:37.891 --> 07:39.693
that most surrogates don't stay
in contact with the parents

07:39.727 --> 07:41.194
after the baby's born.

07:41.228 --> 07:42.763
Goldie, we hope that you'll
always be a part of our lives.

07:42.796 --> 07:45.499
We can hope this is permanent,
but the truth is,

07:45.533 --> 07:47.535
when the baby comes,
everything's gonna change.

07:58.879 --> 08:01.715
*

08:27.074 --> 08:30.544
BRYAN:
12 dudes sitting around
gossiping and drinking wine?

08:30.578 --> 08:32.546
You call that
the Last Supper?

08:32.580 --> 08:35.215
I call that a Tuesday night.

08:35.248 --> 08:37.384
Hey, Mary. I'm a virgin, too.

08:37.417 --> 08:40.654
I've also slept in a barn
with three wise men.

08:40.688 --> 08:41.755
I'm sorry. I shouldn't be

08:41.789 --> 08:43.056
talking smack
about your mother.

08:43.090 --> 08:45.793
But you know who judges me?
Your father.

08:46.594 --> 08:48.629
You here for confession?

08:53.934 --> 08:56.870
Uh, bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

08:56.904 --> 09:00.741
It has been 20 years
since my last confession.

09:00.774 --> 09:04.211
Commandment-wise, I have

09:04.244 --> 09:06.246
pretty much done 'em all,

09:06.279 --> 09:09.082
except for kill someone and
covet my neighbor's wife.

09:09.116 --> 09:11.585
Okay, three Hail Marys.
Have a nice day.

09:11.619 --> 09:14.354
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Um, is-is... That's it?

09:14.387 --> 09:16.123
Well, if you're not gonna
take this seriously,

09:16.156 --> 09:17.591
I'm gonna get back
to playing Angry Birds.

09:17.625 --> 09:19.559
Oh, okay, um,

09:19.593 --> 09:21.561
my partner and I are

09:21.595 --> 09:23.697
having a baby and we're looking
for godparents,

09:23.731 --> 09:25.599
but I don't think I can find
spiritual foundation

09:25.633 --> 09:27.601
in others if I can't
even find it in myself.

09:27.635 --> 09:29.269
So that's why I'm here.

09:29.302 --> 09:30.403
So, you're gay.

09:30.437 --> 09:32.706
Uh, yeah. I guess I should have
led with that.

09:32.740 --> 09:34.407
No, I get it.
I committed my life

09:34.441 --> 09:36.043
to a man, as well.
Eh, that's really funny.

09:36.076 --> 09:38.111
I'm actually talking
about an actual man

09:38.145 --> 09:40.047
that I actually
lay with,

09:40.080 --> 09:41.615
Leviticus style.

09:41.649 --> 09:43.383
Well, contrary
to popular opinion,

09:43.416 --> 09:46.286
being gay isn't a sin.

09:46.319 --> 09:48.055
The church is not anti-gay.

09:48.088 --> 09:50.557
Yet any chance he gets,
the Pope treats gay marriage

09:50.590 --> 09:52.425
like Amanda Bynes treats
pedestrians.

09:52.459 --> 09:54.294
Oh, yeah, the Pope.
Come on.

09:54.327 --> 09:55.629
Haven't you ever had
a lovable old uncle

09:55.663 --> 09:57.564
who popped off
intolerant comments

09:57.597 --> 09:58.899
at a family barbecue?

09:58.932 --> 10:00.300
Can't you get fired
for saying stuff like that?

10:00.333 --> 10:01.635
I don't know
if you noticed,

10:01.669 --> 10:03.904
but it's pretty hard
to get fired around here.

10:03.937 --> 10:05.338
(chuckles)

10:05.372 --> 10:07.240
I was raised Catholic.

10:07.274 --> 10:09.076
I love the tradition,

10:09.109 --> 10:10.744
I love the ritual.

10:10.778 --> 10:13.146
I mean, don't get me started
on the Stations of the Cross.

10:13.180 --> 10:14.915
But you guys don't accept me.

10:14.948 --> 10:18.418
So, what am I supposed
to do, Father?

10:18.451 --> 10:20.320
I mean, you tell me.
Where do I go?

10:20.353 --> 10:22.656
Well, there are
plenty of churches

10:22.690 --> 10:24.825
specifically geared
to your community.

10:24.858 --> 10:26.994
Uch! Rainbow flags
and tambourines.

10:27.027 --> 10:29.162
I don't want to be forced to
use a separate water fountain.

10:29.196 --> 10:31.164
Why can't the church be
accepting of all people?

10:31.198 --> 10:34.835
We are. We embrace everyone,
just like Jesus.

10:34.868 --> 10:36.770
Oh, you know what?
You toss Jesus' name around,

10:36.804 --> 10:38.105
but you don't exactly
practice what he preached,

10:38.138 --> 10:39.673
'cause Jesus wouldn't
have judged people

10:39.707 --> 10:41.508
based on their sexuality
because Jesus loved everyone.

10:41.541 --> 10:43.343
Oh, wrong!
I never bought that

10:43.376 --> 10:45.445
"Jesus is a blissed out
hippie" crap.

10:45.478 --> 10:47.314
That man was
pissed off!

10:47.347 --> 10:49.316
He walked into temples,
told 'em they were doing it

10:49.349 --> 10:50.483
all wrong
and wrecked the place.

10:50.517 --> 10:53.186
He was the Chuck Norris
of his day.

10:53.220 --> 10:54.822
Except his beard
wasn't nearly as well-groomed.

10:54.855 --> 10:56.623
Well, as true as that might be,

10:56.656 --> 10:58.325
Jesus also said
turn the other cheek.

10:58.358 --> 11:00.961
Which didn't mean,
lay down and take it.

11:00.994 --> 11:03.697
In those days,
turn the other cheek
was an act of defiance.

11:03.731 --> 11:06.299
It meant,
I will see your insult

11:06.333 --> 11:08.035
and raise you a "suck it."

11:08.068 --> 11:11.705
He saw hypocrisy
and injustice

11:11.739 --> 11:14.374
and he said, "Seriously?
You guys are idiots.

11:14.407 --> 11:16.243
This has got to change!"

11:16.276 --> 11:18.678
So you're saying
the church can change?
Well, it would.

11:18.712 --> 11:22.549
I've seen gay people battle
discrimination and march

11:22.582 --> 11:23.817
for marriage
equality.

11:23.851 --> 11:26.019
They demanded
the right to fight
for their countries,

11:26.053 --> 11:28.555
but for their souls?
Nope.

11:28.588 --> 11:30.891
They just give up,
walk away.

11:30.924 --> 11:32.726
Jesus was
a fighter, son.

11:32.760 --> 11:34.094
How about you?

11:38.265 --> 11:40.233
Hey, did you call Goldie

11:40.267 --> 11:42.402
and remind them to come pick up
Shania's guinea pig?

11:42.435 --> 11:43.904
Yeah,
right before I went to church.

11:43.937 --> 11:46.573
I'm not nagging you.
You don't have to be sarcastic.

11:46.606 --> 11:47.908
No, David,
I really went to church.

11:47.941 --> 11:49.509
I met with a priest
and everything.

11:49.542 --> 11:51.578
I even confessed my sins.

11:51.611 --> 11:52.846
That doesn't sound like
the man that I'm not

11:52.880 --> 11:54.247
allowed to marry.
I just figured

11:54.281 --> 11:55.916
if we're getting serious
about finding godparents,

11:55.949 --> 11:57.751
we should probably get serious
about finding God.

11:57.785 --> 11:59.586
The church used to be
really important to me.

11:59.619 --> 12:02.189
I used to go every week.
Do you ever think about

12:02.222 --> 12:03.356
maybe going back to Judaism?

12:03.390 --> 12:05.358
Ugh! I couldn't shake it
if I tried. Why do

12:05.392 --> 12:08.228
you think my ancestors wandered
the hot desert for 40 years?

12:08.261 --> 12:11.098
It's why my people retire
to Fort Lauderdale.

12:11.131 --> 12:12.532
Is that why?

12:12.565 --> 12:14.067
I guess with the baby coming,

12:14.101 --> 12:15.903
I should think about
maybe joining a temple.

12:15.936 --> 12:18.071
We got a problem.

12:18.105 --> 12:20.808
Please tell me he just watched
that Steve Martin movie

12:20.841 --> 12:22.876
about competitive bird watching
and fell into a deep sleep.

12:22.910 --> 12:24.111
He's dead.

12:24.144 --> 12:25.245
David, did you forget
to water it?

12:25.278 --> 12:27.047
See, that's the problem
right there.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.281
I thought you were
gonna do it!

12:28.315 --> 12:30.383
You know I just say things!
Quick, give him mouth-to-mouth!

12:30.417 --> 12:31.451
What? I'm not putting

12:31.484 --> 12:33.286
my mouth on a pig,
even a guinea pig.

12:33.320 --> 12:34.487
I've had a religious
awakening.

12:34.521 --> 12:36.623
From this moment on,
I'm keeping kosher.

12:38.691 --> 12:41.628
(sighs) Ah, God.
Okay, Marshmallow,

12:41.661 --> 12:43.897
I'm just gonna check
the vital signs here.

12:43.931 --> 12:45.698
Just blow
into his mouth!
Okay!

12:47.634 --> 12:49.102
Run away from the light,
Marshmallow.

12:49.136 --> 12:50.603
Think about your family!

12:50.637 --> 12:51.771
Come on, Marshmallow!

12:51.805 --> 12:54.574
You have so much
to live for, Marshmallow!

12:54.607 --> 12:56.944
Oh, I'm sorry.

12:56.977 --> 12:58.078
We killed Marshmallow.

12:58.111 --> 12:59.612
How in the hell are we supposed
to take care of a baby

12:59.646 --> 13:01.781
when we can't even keep
a guinea pig alive for a day?

13:01.815 --> 13:02.916
Well, for starters,
we're not keeping

13:02.950 --> 13:05.152
our baby in a cage in
the laundry room.

13:05.185 --> 13:08.155
Poor Shania.
What are we gonna do?

13:08.188 --> 13:09.656
It's so obvious.

13:09.689 --> 13:11.992
Rocky, go to the pet store,

13:12.025 --> 13:13.994
find a guinea pig that looks
just like Marshmallow.

13:14.027 --> 13:16.163
The kid will never know
the difference.

13:16.196 --> 13:17.831
That's brilliant.
What are you doing?

13:17.865 --> 13:19.699
Googling to see how many
TV families have tried

13:19.732 --> 13:21.601
the same ol' tired plan
that never works.

13:21.634 --> 13:24.972
Okay, let's see:
The Bradys, The Partridges,

13:25.005 --> 13:28.341
the Growing Painses...
oh, and Saved by the Bell.

13:28.375 --> 13:31.178
Well, if it's good enough
for Saved by the Bell,

13:31.211 --> 13:32.512
it's good enough for me.

13:32.545 --> 13:34.347
Oh, I know.
I watch your show.

13:34.381 --> 13:36.183
Rocky,
it is really amazing.

13:36.216 --> 13:37.851
I would never even know
the difference.

13:37.885 --> 13:40.020
Yeah.
What'd you do
with the body?

13:40.053 --> 13:42.522
Don't ask questions you can't
handle the answer to.

13:42.555 --> 13:43.523
(doorbell rings)

13:43.556 --> 13:44.958
Oh, my God,
they're here.

13:44.992 --> 13:46.860
Okay, act natural.
I sound like an
insane person.

13:46.894 --> 13:48.828
BRYAN:
Hey!

13:48.862 --> 13:50.197
Shania, there's
someone who is

13:50.230 --> 13:52.499
literally pooping himself
with excitement to see you.

13:52.532 --> 13:53.700
And for once,
it's not me.

13:53.733 --> 13:56.469
Oh, we missed you!

13:56.503 --> 13:59.706
He missed you, too!
He was so much fun.

13:59.739 --> 14:01.841
(chuckles)

14:01.875 --> 14:05.545
Uh, something's wrong
with Marshmallow.

14:05.578 --> 14:07.180
What do you mean?

14:07.214 --> 14:10.017
He has a vagina.
Rocky...

14:10.050 --> 14:12.552
Hey, you want me
to check a guinea pig's
private parts, that's extra.

14:12.585 --> 14:14.387
What's happening here?

14:14.421 --> 14:16.156
Uh, I think I can explain.

14:16.189 --> 14:19.359
Shania,

14:19.392 --> 14:23.396
the transgender movement
is a proud and...

14:23.430 --> 14:25.899
Oh, my God, Bryan!

14:25.933 --> 14:27.534
Honey, that is not
Marshmallow.

14:27.567 --> 14:31.071
That is a guinea pig
David and Bryan well-meaningly

14:31.104 --> 14:34.574
told me to go out and buy
to fool you into thinking
it was Marshmallow.

14:34.607 --> 14:36.343
So, Marshmallow is...?

14:36.376 --> 14:37.744
Yes, honey,
Marshmallow has passed.

14:37.777 --> 14:39.579
How did it happen?

14:39.612 --> 14:41.714
Oh, come here.

14:45.818 --> 14:48.521
Guinea pigs have a
number, just like us,

14:48.555 --> 14:50.257
and when it's up,
it's up.

14:50.290 --> 14:54.094
Life is a mighty river, and no
one can change its course.

14:54.127 --> 14:56.096
She's like a seven-foot-tall
Maya Angelou.

14:56.129 --> 14:58.865
Jesus said,
"My sheep hears my voice."

14:58.898 --> 15:01.901
I'm actually gonna substitute
that for guinea pig.

15:01.935 --> 15:03.971
"My guinea pig hear my voice.

15:04.004 --> 15:05.872
"I know them,
and they follow me.

15:05.905 --> 15:08.942
And no one can snatch
them out of my hand."

15:08.976 --> 15:10.443
Do you know what that means?

15:10.477 --> 15:13.113
I think it means no one can take
the memories

15:13.146 --> 15:14.547
of Marshmallow
away from us.

15:14.581 --> 15:18.051
They'll last in our hearts
as long as we're alive.

15:18.085 --> 15:18.952
Aw...

15:18.986 --> 15:20.553
I'm still gonna miss
Marshmallow.

15:20.587 --> 15:21.788
Oh, I know, baby.

15:21.821 --> 15:23.590
I wish David had
remembered to feed it.

15:24.657 --> 15:26.259
But look at this
little guy.

15:26.293 --> 15:28.595
So you know, I'm giving
the new guinea pig

15:28.628 --> 15:31.164
to my goddaughter,
unless it dies.

15:31.198 --> 15:33.833
Then I'm throwing it in
the pool with the other one.

15:39.339 --> 15:41.008
Thank you all for
coming to celebrate

15:41.041 --> 15:42.642
the life of our beloved friend,
Marshmallow.

15:42.675 --> 15:44.744
I'm glad she opted
for a closed shoebox.

15:44.777 --> 15:47.580
Marshmallow wasn't with
our class very long,
but he had a full life.

15:47.614 --> 15:50.250
My mom and I took him
on the L.A. Metro once,

15:50.283 --> 15:52.852
and I think he really
appreciated the strong smells.

15:52.885 --> 15:54.654
Most people think
that death is

15:54.687 --> 15:56.523
like this doorway
to the afterlife.

15:56.556 --> 15:59.426
But the truth is,
we don't know what happens.

15:59.459 --> 16:02.762
See, death is a part of life,
but we have a chance.

16:02.795 --> 16:05.832
No, not a chance,
a responsibility

16:05.865 --> 16:07.767
to love each other
and do nice things

16:07.800 --> 16:09.536
while we're here
on this earth.

16:09.569 --> 16:11.538
'Cause, really,
that's all we got, man.

16:11.571 --> 16:13.106
Testify, girl.

16:13.140 --> 16:16.376
Now. Now is the only thing
that's for sure.

16:16.409 --> 16:19.679
And if you ever saw Marshmallow
nibbling on a kernel of corn,

16:19.712 --> 16:21.481
you'd know
he felt the same way.

16:39.666 --> 16:41.468
God bless you,
little one.

16:41.501 --> 16:44.037
We'll see your
little furry face
in the afterlife.

16:44.071 --> 16:46.073
Or not.

16:51.778 --> 16:55.582
She really is
an amazing kid.

16:55.615 --> 16:58.318
You know, I have to tell
you guys something.

16:58.351 --> 17:01.221
That stuff Gary
said? Shania never
lost faith in you.

17:01.254 --> 17:02.422
It was me.

17:02.455 --> 17:04.391
Come on, Goldie.
You're family.

17:04.424 --> 17:05.925
No, please don't say family.

17:05.958 --> 17:09.162
My whole life, my family has
done nothing but leave.

17:09.196 --> 17:10.163
All of them:

17:10.197 --> 17:12.765
my mom, my dad,
Clay, my grandpa.

17:12.799 --> 17:15.902
It's like just when I
trust someone with my heart,

17:15.935 --> 17:17.604
they break it.

17:17.637 --> 17:18.838
Honey, if you
haven't noticed,

17:18.871 --> 17:20.507
we're not exactly
your typical family.

17:20.540 --> 17:22.242
Yeah.
But we're not going anywhere.

17:31.951 --> 17:35.021
I hate when the wristband
on my watch get caught
on my arm hair.

17:35.054 --> 17:37.023
Whoa, what you doing?

17:37.056 --> 17:38.191
Praying.

17:38.225 --> 17:40.860
Why? Did you call that lazy
anorexic actress

17:40.893 --> 17:42.429
at work lazy again?
No.

17:42.462 --> 17:44.364
When I was a kid, my mom used

17:44.397 --> 17:46.199
to come into my room
and pray with me.

17:46.233 --> 17:48.701
And we'd say
the Our Father
and the Hail Mary.

17:48.735 --> 17:50.303
I would feel her next to me,

17:50.337 --> 17:53.206
and I, I just knew everything
was okay.

17:53.240 --> 17:55.308
Forget it. It's silly.

17:55.342 --> 17:57.110
No, it's not.

17:57.144 --> 18:00.313
It is not silly.
I wish I still had that.

18:00.347 --> 18:03.650
When I first went
to New York for college,
I didn't know anyone.

18:03.683 --> 18:05.452
I was lonely.
So I went to temple.

18:05.485 --> 18:06.919
And all the prayers

18:06.953 --> 18:09.556
and the people
the constant clearing
of throats

18:09.589 --> 18:11.224
made a big city feel smaller.

18:11.258 --> 18:13.460
When I went to UCLA
for med school,

18:13.493 --> 18:15.995
the only praying I did was
to not screw up my surgeries.

18:16.028 --> 18:19.399
I guess we both have reasons
for losing our way.

18:19.432 --> 18:20.833
Mm. This is all great,

18:20.867 --> 18:23.403
but it doesn't help us find
godparents.

18:23.436 --> 18:24.737
You could pray with me.

18:24.771 --> 18:27.307
I don't know about praying
on my knees.

18:27.340 --> 18:29.976
I could pray from here,
reassure you

18:30.009 --> 18:31.311
about your strong hairline.
Okay.

18:31.344 --> 18:33.413
All right. What do I do,
like this?
Mm-hmm.

18:33.446 --> 18:35.748
Okay. So what are
we praying for?

18:35.782 --> 18:38.451
Well, my mom used to say
you shouldn't pray for stuff.

18:38.485 --> 18:40.753
You should use this time
to thank God.

18:40.787 --> 18:42.522
Okay, what are you thankful for?

18:42.555 --> 18:44.023
My stuff.
(snickers)

18:45.692 --> 18:47.026
And you.

18:47.059 --> 18:48.695
Our baby.

18:48.728 --> 18:50.263
Goldie and Shania.

18:50.297 --> 18:51.431
Isn't she amazing?

18:51.464 --> 18:54.100
Uh!
What is with the
"Live for the now" thing?

18:54.133 --> 18:56.269
She's like our own baby Buddha.

18:56.303 --> 18:58.438
And don't forget Rocky.
I mean, she's like Jesus,

18:58.471 --> 18:59.872
except without
his extensions.

18:59.906 --> 19:01.808
Mm-hmm. She's...

19:02.809 --> 19:04.644
BRYAN:
We have searched
high and low

19:04.677 --> 19:06.213
to find our baby's
spiritual guides,

19:06.246 --> 19:09.849
when I all we
really needed to do was
search low and high.

19:09.882 --> 19:13.220
Some people look for faith
in a church or a temple.

19:13.253 --> 19:17.056
We have found
our ours in you.

19:17.089 --> 19:19.692
So, Rocky, Shania,

19:19.726 --> 19:22.895
will you be our
baby's godparents?

19:22.929 --> 19:23.963
(laughs)

19:23.996 --> 19:25.131
Really?! I accept!

19:25.164 --> 19:26.799
Hey!

19:26.833 --> 19:28.801
Hells yeah!

19:28.835 --> 19:31.037
And all I thought you
wanted me in your life for

19:31.070 --> 19:33.706
was to keep your mini fridge
stocked with designer water.

19:33.740 --> 19:35.742
(both laugh)

19:35.775 --> 19:38.845
Well, one job doesn't
rule out the other.

19:43.350 --> 19:44.984
I can already visualize
the park bench

19:45.017 --> 19:48.187
where I will teach your child
wisdom from the ancient mystics,

19:48.221 --> 19:50.122
plus old episodes
of Quantum Leap.

19:53.960 --> 19:56.929
Just so we're square,
I'm not mad at you anymore.

19:56.963 --> 20:00.500
I'm still jealous of your
pool party abs, but not mad.

20:00.533 --> 20:01.668
Bryan?

20:01.701 --> 20:03.603
Hey, Father.

20:03.636 --> 20:05.905
So, you decided to fight?

20:05.938 --> 20:07.507
Yes.

20:07.540 --> 20:09.676
It's okay if I come to
Mass every now and then?

20:09.709 --> 20:11.278
Maybe I could bring up
the gifts some time?

20:11.311 --> 20:13.746
I mean, if I'm not at temple
with my Jewish baby daddy.

20:13.780 --> 20:16.349
I'd love to see you
at Mass, Bryan.

20:16.383 --> 20:17.750
You and your family.

20:19.386 --> 20:22.522
Hey, since when did they let
girls be altar boys?

20:22.555 --> 20:24.591
Altar servers.
Oh.
Yeah.

20:24.624 --> 20:26.192
Happened in
the mid-'90s.

20:26.225 --> 20:27.527
Took a few thousand years,

20:27.560 --> 20:29.629
but you know,
things can change...

20:29.662 --> 20:31.431
if somebody's willing
to fight for it.

20:32.299 --> 20:34.434
I'll see you Sunday.

20:34.467 --> 20:37.604
Oh, and if you want to bring
the gifts, I'd sign up now.

20:37.637 --> 20:40.072
Mark Wahlberg
comes to the 9:00.

20:40.106 --> 20:41.308
This place is packed.

20:41.341 --> 20:44.010
That guy's abs
put Jesus' to shame.

20:57.189 --> 20:59.792
Father, sometimes I read
Us Weekly, and I just, I'm so

20:59.826 --> 21:01.394
concerned for the state
of the world.

21:01.428 --> 21:03.730
I think you should probably
read less Us Weekly

21:03.763 --> 21:05.332
and more...
In Touch?

21:05.365 --> 21:07.600
Uh, get in touch
with your feelings.

21:07.634 --> 21:09.569
Yeah, get in touch
with real things, you know?

21:09.602 --> 21:11.804
Father does Jesus forgive
Britney Spears?

21:11.838 --> 21:12.839
Yes.

21:12.872 --> 21:14.674
What about Amanda Bynes?
Yes.

21:14.707 --> 21:16.008
What about the Kardashians?

21:16.042 --> 21:17.076
Yes.

21:17.109 --> 21:18.511
Kim Kardashian?

21:18.545 --> 21:20.179
Yes.

21:20.212 --> 21:22.349
If Khloe Kardashian walked
into this church right now,

21:22.382 --> 21:23.516
would she burst into flames?

21:23.550 --> 21:25.017
Yes.

21:25.051 --> 21:27.053
That's what I thought.
