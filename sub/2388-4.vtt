00:01.043 --> 00:03.504
<i>Kids, once your Uncle Marshall
and Aunt Lily found</i>

00:03.504 --> 00:05.088
<i>a nanny for baby Marvin,</i>

00:05.172 --> 00:06.340
<i>they were excited</i>

00:06.340 --> 00:08.467
<i>for their first night out
together in five months.</i>

00:08.467 --> 00:10.135
<i>And so were we.</i>

00:10.219 --> 00:11.929
Mama.

00:11.929 --> 00:14.056
Dada.

00:14.056 --> 00:15.849
Hi, gang. Ooh.

00:15.933 --> 00:18.560
Ah, so, now that there's no

00:18.644 --> 00:20.604
screaming baby to distract us,

00:20.604 --> 00:22.523
- what have you guys been up to lately?
- Yeah.

00:22.523 --> 00:24.942
<i>This was a surprisingly
loaded question.</i>

00:24.942 --> 00:27.027
<i>You see, right
after Marvin was born,</i>

00:27.027 --> 00:29.571
<i>Lily and Marshall
had issued a decree.</i>

00:29.655 --> 00:33.617
New rule: you can't come to us
with any issue

00:33.617 --> 00:35.702
unless it's an eight
or higher.

00:35.786 --> 00:38.163
<i>And we were doing
our best to abide.</i>

00:38.247 --> 00:40.749
Ted, how are things
going with Victoria?

00:41.917 --> 00:44.002
My dad made the funniest joke.

00:44.086 --> 00:46.755
He said that since you're
the reason I left the wedding,

00:46.839 --> 00:49.466
you owe him the $70,000
he paid for it,

00:49.550 --> 00:50.843
or else.

00:52.678 --> 00:55.222
You know, he's not
usually funny like that.

00:56.515 --> 00:59.852
<i>Not promising,
but not an eight.</i>

00:59.852 --> 01:01.270
Everything's great.

01:02.563 --> 01:04.815
And Robin, how's
everything with Nick?

01:05.941 --> 01:07.818
Finally ready
for a ride on the bike?

01:07.818 --> 01:09.820
Who? Me?

01:09.820 --> 01:12.531
Let's ride, Big Daddy.

01:15.075 --> 01:17.077
Oh, yeah.

01:20.080 --> 01:22.165
Mama likey.

01:25.627 --> 01:27.629
Robin, over here.
- Ooh.

01:29.131 --> 01:30.799
Eco-friendly.

01:32.092 --> 01:33.594
She runs on corn.

01:35.596 --> 01:38.640
<i>Totally lady bone killer,
but not an eight.</i>

01:39.892 --> 01:41.602
Everything's great.

01:41.602 --> 01:44.104
And how are things
for the old Barnacle?

01:49.276 --> 01:50.777
<i>Not an eight.</i>

01:50.861 --> 01:53.071
<i>At best, she was a six,
six and a half.</i>

01:53.155 --> 01:55.157
<i>More like a four by the time
I was done with her.</i>

01:55.157 --> 01:56.992
<i>Mental self-five.</i>

01:58.160 --> 01:59.745
Everything's great.

01:59.745 --> 02:02.956
To long-awaited MacLaren's
return of Marshall and Lily.

02:05.042 --> 02:06.752
Mmm.

02:06.752 --> 02:08.045
I've missed this.
Okay. We got to go.

02:08.045 --> 02:10.088
W-what?
You just got here.

02:10.172 --> 02:12.049
I cleared my whole night
for you guys.

02:12.049 --> 02:14.051
I didn't even bring
my booty-call phone.

02:14.051 --> 02:16.303
Oh, I'm sorry,
but we just really

02:16.303 --> 02:17.804
need some time
to ourselves.

02:17.888 --> 02:19.640
I promise
we'll hang out soon.

02:19.640 --> 02:21.183
- See you guys.
- Bye.

02:22.476 --> 02:24.853
<i>Booty, booty, booty,
booty rocking everywhere</i>

02:24.937 --> 02:27.189
<i>Booty, booty, booty, booty
rocking everywhere</i>

02:27.189 --> 02:28.398
<i>Booty, booty, booty, booty</i>

02:28.482 --> 02:29.942
Yeah, like I'm going
to leave this at home.

02:31.068 --> 02:32.819
Barney Stinson.
How may I direct my penis?

02:32.903 --> 02:34.404
Oh, geez.

02:34.488 --> 02:36.615
It is so nice to be out
in the fresh air.

02:37.908 --> 02:39.034
- You smell that?
- Ooh.

02:39.034 --> 02:41.078
That's the smell of urine
that isn't Marvin's.

02:41.078 --> 02:43.288
Oh, God, I miss that smell.

02:43.372 --> 02:45.082
You know, I thought
we'd spend the whole time

02:45.082 --> 02:47.876
worrying about Marvin,
but it's actually nice to be out

02:47.960 --> 02:49.336
in the world, living life.

02:49.336 --> 02:50.504
Yeah.

02:54.550 --> 02:56.635
Death is all around us.

02:58.053 --> 03:00.639
Wow, that urine smell
just got a lot stronger.

03:15.571 --> 03:17.030
So, you guys spent

03:17.114 --> 03:18.323
your first night out
in five months,

03:18.407 --> 03:20.200
sitting at home planning
for your own deaths?

03:20.284 --> 03:22.995
Yeah, we found this Web site
that helps you make a will.

03:22.995 --> 03:25.622
- In the event of your death...
- Ooh!

03:25.706 --> 03:27.082
I'm sorry.

03:27.082 --> 03:29.501
It-it's just-just real sad
to think about.

03:29.585 --> 03:30.627
Oh, I know.

03:30.711 --> 03:31.837
All right.

03:31.837 --> 03:34.006
In the event of your death...

03:34.006 --> 03:35.465
Okay, no, you know what?

03:35.549 --> 03:36.758
Let's just start
with something easy.

03:36.842 --> 03:38.719
- Okay.
- Okay? Please enter your zip code.

03:40.846 --> 03:44.099
We'll never get mail again.

03:44.183 --> 03:47.686
I keep reassuring Lily
that this is all hypothetical.

03:47.686 --> 03:50.772
Relatively speaking,
New York City is very safe.

03:50.856 --> 03:54.568
Please, faulty elevators,
exploding man hole covers,

03:54.568 --> 03:56.028
- jealous husbands.
- Mmm.

03:56.028 --> 03:58.530
- This place is a coroner's paradise.
- Ooh!

03:58.614 --> 04:01.325
They are way more likely to eat
it in a mugging gone wrong.

04:01.325 --> 04:03.994
There was a double hommy
on your block like a week ago.

04:03.994 --> 04:05.746
Caught it on the scanner
during lunch.

04:05.746 --> 04:07.164
Knife job.

04:07.164 --> 04:08.332
Guy made a real mess
of it too.

04:11.293 --> 04:12.669
Anyway,

04:12.753 --> 04:15.506
then we got to the section
about picking a guardian.

04:15.506 --> 04:19.134
Sometimes couples choose one
of their parents as a guardian.

04:19.218 --> 04:21.094
That makes it simple.

04:21.178 --> 04:22.262
My mom.

04:22.346 --> 04:23.764
Your mom?

04:23.764 --> 04:25.349
What's wrong with my mom?

04:25.349 --> 04:28.143
Are you...

04:30.270 --> 04:32.356
Fine. All right.

04:32.356 --> 04:34.900
Marvin won't go
to my loving mother.

04:34.900 --> 04:36.360
But he's got to go to somebody.

04:36.360 --> 04:37.528
Fine.

04:37.528 --> 04:39.154
What about my mom?

04:39.238 --> 04:40.572
Your mom?

04:40.656 --> 04:42.074
Um, excuse...

04:49.540 --> 04:50.666
Fine.

04:50.666 --> 04:52.543
Not my mom.

04:52.543 --> 04:53.836
What about my dad?

04:53.836 --> 04:55.587
Your dad?

04:55.671 --> 04:56.880
Okay, yeah, he's out.

04:56.964 --> 04:59.424
Wait a minute.
You know who could be good?

04:59.508 --> 05:00.801
My brother Marcus.

05:00.801 --> 05:02.636
He's like a great dad.

05:02.636 --> 05:04.137
Do you remember
his Christmas card?

05:07.391 --> 05:11.562
Questionable denim choices
aside, Marcus is a good dad.

05:11.562 --> 05:15.023
I guess if Marvin has to go
to anyone, it should be family.

05:15.107 --> 05:16.650
Okay, great.

05:16.650 --> 05:18.193
Okay.

05:18.277 --> 05:20.112
Marcus, hey, how's it going?

05:20.112 --> 05:22.447
Pretty freaking sweet, buttwipe.

05:22.531 --> 05:26.201
I packed up all my crap, I said,
"See ya" to Sarah and the kids,

05:26.285 --> 05:28.328
and I finally got my dream job

05:28.412 --> 05:31.540
as a mixologist down here
at Carnalism 2.

05:31.540 --> 05:33.000
Hold on.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.878
Some punk's trying to use
his snorkel rental as a bong.

05:35.878 --> 05:37.045
Hey!

05:37.129 --> 05:40.257
You be packin'
that bowl too tight, <i>mon.</i>

05:42.634 --> 05:44.928
So, now we don't
have a guardian.

05:45.012 --> 05:46.930
You know, as your best friend,

05:47.014 --> 05:51.143
if called upon,
I'd be honored to raise Marvin.

05:51.143 --> 05:53.395
If you want him to be raised
by his underwear on a flagpole,

05:53.395 --> 05:54.730
Ted's your guy.

05:54.730 --> 05:57.065
If you want him pulling the chord
on some other nerd's panties,

05:57.149 --> 05:58.275
I'm your guy.

05:58.275 --> 06:00.569
I'll teach that kid
how to be awesome

06:00.569 --> 06:02.404
in ways you and Lily
never could.

06:02.404 --> 06:04.448
It's going to be legend...

06:04.448 --> 06:06.033
wait for it,
no, I won't wait for it

06:06.033 --> 06:07.242
and neither should
little baby Marvin,

06:07.326 --> 06:08.785
so maybe it's better
if you two just die right now...

06:08.869 --> 06:10.287
...dary.

06:10.287 --> 06:14.374
<i>And so began the longest week
of Lily and Marshall's lives.</i>

06:16.001 --> 06:17.669
Huh?

06:17.753 --> 06:19.379
Huh?

06:22.883 --> 06:27.554
<i>Bro McDonald had a farm, E-I-E-I-bro</i>

06:27.638 --> 06:30.057
<i>And on that farm
he had some chicks</i>

06:30.057 --> 06:32.059
<i>E-I-E-I-bro</i>

06:32.059 --> 06:34.603
<i>With a hot chick here
and a dumb chick there...</i>

06:36.313 --> 06:38.398
Huh? Huh?

06:42.236 --> 06:44.988
<i>Bro, bro, bro your broat</i>

06:45.072 --> 06:47.115
<i>Gently to the bar</i>

06:47.199 --> 06:50.410
<i>Hit on sluts,
then do ten shots and...</i>

06:52.788 --> 06:54.456
Huh?

06:55.749 --> 06:57.584
Huh?

06:59.419 --> 07:00.796
Aah!

07:05.342 --> 07:08.679
<i>The boobs on the bus go up and down</i>

07:08.679 --> 07:10.973
<i>Up and down, up and down</i>

07:10.973 --> 07:14.434
<i>The boobs on the bus
go up and down...</i>

07:19.565 --> 07:21.775
<i>All through the town</i>

07:24.444 --> 07:27.030
What? You think you can bribe them
with a stroller?

07:27.114 --> 07:28.532
They already got one, foo.

07:28.532 --> 07:31.118
Oh, this is no stroller, Robin.

07:31.118 --> 07:32.661
I call it the Broller.

07:32.661 --> 07:34.830
Go ahead. Look inside.

07:36.999 --> 07:38.667
I don't get it.
I don't see anything.

07:38.667 --> 07:40.836
Yeah, but Papa does.

07:43.255 --> 07:44.840
Those Robin's boobies?

07:44.840 --> 07:48.844
When new nubile hotties lean in
to inspect your bundle of joy,

07:48.844 --> 07:51.555
you can inspect
their bundles of joy.

07:51.555 --> 07:53.098
The Broller.

07:53.182 --> 07:54.892
God, I come up
with a lot of good stuff.

07:54.892 --> 07:56.935
- Hey, guys, hey...
- Hey.

07:57.019 --> 07:59.146
Lily and I need you
to come upstairs.

07:59.146 --> 08:00.814
This is an important decision

08:00.898 --> 08:02.733
and we can't have you
constantly interrupting us

08:02.733 --> 08:04.776
with this childish competition.

08:04.860 --> 08:07.112
Which is why
we're going to make it

08:07.196 --> 08:10.449
an official competition!

08:10.449 --> 08:13.076
We're going to play
<i>Who Wants to Be a Godparent?</i>

08:13.160 --> 08:14.912
Right after this word
from our sponsors.

08:17.873 --> 08:19.708
Why is he talking
to the wall?

08:24.296 --> 08:27.591
Wait, this is how you're going
to choose a guardian for Marvin?

08:27.591 --> 08:29.051
I mean, why don't
you just put us

08:29.051 --> 08:31.637
in a three-way cage match and
go with whoever's left standing?

08:31.637 --> 08:34.890
We talked about that, but it
gave Robin an unfair advantage.

08:34.890 --> 08:36.433
Yeah, you see, guys, we were

08:36.517 --> 08:38.685
really struggling
with this decision.

08:38.769 --> 08:40.854
<i>All through the town</i>

08:43.148 --> 08:44.942
Babe, I know
these guys have been

08:44.942 --> 08:47.778
a little over the top lately.
A little?

08:47.778 --> 08:51.448
But we still have to pick
a guardian just in case.

08:51.532 --> 08:52.908
In case of what?

08:52.908 --> 08:54.076
Don't make me say it.

08:54.076 --> 08:55.536
Say it. I can handle it.

08:55.536 --> 08:57.204
Say it.

08:57.204 --> 08:58.497
In case we die.

09:00.541 --> 09:03.544
How can you even say it?

09:04.670 --> 09:06.213
<i>And then I thought
what do you do</i>

09:06.213 --> 09:07.965
<i>if you got a wife
who won't stop crying,</i>

09:07.965 --> 09:10.425
<i>three idiots
who won't stop bribing you,</i>

09:10.509 --> 09:13.637
<i>and a universally beloved
skill for gamesmanship?</i>

09:13.637 --> 09:16.265
You take a bunch
of guardianship scenarios,

09:16.265 --> 09:18.475
throw them on a wheel,
buy your wife an expensive dress

09:18.559 --> 09:21.144
- so she'll participate.
- I'm pretty again.

09:21.228 --> 09:22.563
Bottom line is
I just wanted

09:22.563 --> 09:24.898
to make the idea
of me and Lily dying...

09:24.982 --> 09:26.358
- fun.
- Oh.

09:26.358 --> 09:28.652
Now, if you'll step behind
your podiums, we'll get started.

09:32.781 --> 09:34.783
Contestants,
here's how the game works.

09:34.867 --> 09:37.452
- Lily will spin that wheel.
- Not yet.

09:37.536 --> 09:39.580
When it lands
on a parenting issue,

09:39.580 --> 09:42.875
you'll each describe how
you would handle it with Marvin.

09:42.875 --> 09:44.668
The contestant with the
highest score gets to be

09:44.668 --> 09:45.961
his godparent.

09:45.961 --> 09:48.130
Ready to play?
Great. Lily,

09:48.130 --> 09:50.048
spin that wheel!

09:52.968 --> 09:56.263
Okay, now, see, um, enthusiasm
will factor into your scores.

09:56.263 --> 09:57.681
So, I say again:

09:57.681 --> 10:01.018
Lily, spin...
Spin that wheel!

10:07.399 --> 10:08.525
Ooh.

10:08.609 --> 10:10.068
Our demise.

10:11.320 --> 10:12.905
Barney, how would you

10:12.905 --> 10:17.451
explain to little Marvin
why we're not around anymore?

10:17.451 --> 10:18.911
No.

10:20.204 --> 10:22.206
Easy, all I'd have to do
is change a few words

10:22.206 --> 10:24.124
to one of my classics
with the ladies.

10:24.208 --> 10:27.794
The President of the World
has called your parents away

10:27.878 --> 10:29.796
on a super-secret
space mission.

10:29.880 --> 10:32.674
For the sake of the planet,
you will never see them again.

10:32.758 --> 10:35.511
Now pick up your toys
and say good night to Daddy.

10:35.511 --> 10:38.013
What do you know?
That last line stays the same.

10:38.013 --> 10:39.181
Judges?

10:40.474 --> 10:41.725
Okay, Robin,

10:41.725 --> 10:43.685
what would you do, and remember,

10:43.769 --> 10:45.395
"President of the World
called parents away

10:45.479 --> 10:48.315
"for a super-secret space
mission" has already been taken.

10:48.315 --> 10:51.443
Well, my dad was always upfront
and honest with me,

10:51.527 --> 10:53.028
so that's how I would be.

10:53.028 --> 10:55.531
All right, kid, here's
the deal with the deal.

10:55.531 --> 10:57.533
Your mom and dad are <i>done-ski.</i>

10:57.533 --> 10:59.201
Belly-flopped
off a subway platform.

10:59.201 --> 11:01.245
Mom busted open like a piñata.

11:01.245 --> 11:03.997
What was left of your dad
hung around for a few days.

11:04.081 --> 11:06.083
Anyway, plug's pulled.
Organs donated.

11:06.083 --> 11:08.877
Long story short: I'm your
new mommy now.

11:08.961 --> 11:10.295
Sah-wish!

11:12.256 --> 11:16.176
Well, I was saving these
for the showcase,

11:16.260 --> 11:19.555
but here.
Hey, Lily, look, baby,

11:19.555 --> 11:21.682
- his-and-her watches.
- Ooh.

11:22.891 --> 11:26.186
Ted, the category's all yours.

11:26.270 --> 11:28.063
Okay, here's what I would say.

11:28.063 --> 11:31.483
Well, Marvin, explaining
where your parents are

11:31.567 --> 11:33.193
isn't gonna be easy.

11:33.277 --> 11:37.489
Even I, Lily and Marshall's
best friend

11:38.699 --> 11:41.702
for almost 20 years...

11:42.953 --> 11:44.955
will have
a hard time doing it.

11:44.955 --> 11:49.418
But I do know a guy who's very
good at this sort of thing.

11:50.669 --> 11:53.005
Professor Infosaurus!

11:53.005 --> 11:54.673
Hey, there, squirt!

11:54.673 --> 11:56.550
Death is a difficult

11:56.550 --> 11:59.803
yet unfortunate certainty.

11:59.887 --> 12:03.098
Good enough!
Ted wins the round!

12:03.182 --> 12:04.766
Yes! Yes!
You'll see.

12:04.850 --> 12:08.020
Professor Infosaurus will be
a big, big hit with children.

12:09.479 --> 12:11.982
Isn't that right, kids?

12:15.527 --> 12:16.653
Moving on.

12:19.323 --> 12:20.949
"Discipline."

12:21.033 --> 12:23.327
"How would you handle Marvin

12:23.327 --> 12:26.747
"taking another kid's toy?"
Barney?

12:26.747 --> 12:30.501
That's easy.

12:30.501 --> 12:32.252
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

12:32.336 --> 12:33.504
I'm calling Child Services.

12:33.504 --> 12:35.255
Wait for it.

12:35.339 --> 12:39.426
I'll return your $1,900
alligator-skin belt

12:39.510 --> 12:41.011
when you return that toy.

12:41.011 --> 12:43.722
Until then, you can wear this

12:43.722 --> 12:45.182
disgusting...

12:45.182 --> 12:48.185
...black-and-brown reversible belt.

12:50.896 --> 12:54.233
Hey, I don't like it
any more than you do!

12:54.233 --> 12:57.861
Ted, how would you discipline
little Marvin?

12:57.945 --> 13:00.113
I would be firm.

13:00.197 --> 13:02.908
Fair, but firm.

13:02.908 --> 13:05.953
You, sir, just lost
your television privileges.

13:07.287 --> 13:10.624
Okay, you can watch TV,
but nothing violent.

13:12.042 --> 13:13.126
Okay, it can be violent,

13:13.210 --> 13:15.587
but you have
to do the dishes first.

13:16.880 --> 13:18.966
Okay, I'll do the dishes,
you watch TV.

13:18.966 --> 13:21.593
Let's go get some ice cream!
Come on!

13:21.677 --> 13:24.179
But no sprinkles.

13:25.347 --> 13:27.057
- Robin?
- Okay, sprinkles.

13:28.225 --> 13:32.271
Um, I would do what my dad did:
tough love.

13:32.271 --> 13:33.814
You know where
you're headed, chief?

13:34.982 --> 13:37.609
The British Columbia
Military School for Boys.

13:37.693 --> 13:40.571
Of course, you're actually a
boy, so at least you won't have

13:40.571 --> 13:43.282
to shave off all your hair and
burn your "girlie" clothing in

13:43.282 --> 13:45.367
an old oil drum while
your father stands there

13:45.367 --> 13:47.452
and laughs at you
through the flames!

13:49.288 --> 13:51.415
Oh, my God!

13:53.250 --> 13:55.210
I think that Robin wins
this round

13:55.294 --> 13:59.965
because we love her and she's
in a safe space, right, guys?

13:59.965 --> 14:01.758
- Robin matters!
- Yay! Totally.

14:01.842 --> 14:03.093
Now, that's just
one point, right?

14:04.136 --> 14:05.262
Lily.

14:05.262 --> 14:07.764
A spin... that... wheel!

14:10.809 --> 14:13.270
Oh...

14:13.270 --> 14:14.938
"Birds and Bees."

14:15.022 --> 14:17.566
Barney, "How would you teach
young Marvin

14:17.566 --> 14:19.651
"about the facts of life?"

14:19.735 --> 14:21.445
Hmm...

14:21.445 --> 14:23.864
You're gonna love
Amsterdam, little bro.

14:30.704 --> 14:32.289
Okay, Barney's out
of this round.

14:32.289 --> 14:35.334
Ted, how would you handle
"the talk"?

14:35.334 --> 14:37.878
Well, Marvin would be
a young adult,

14:37.878 --> 14:40.923
so you wouldn't want
to talk down to him.

14:40.923 --> 14:45.260
But that doesn't mean
you can't get down with him.

14:45.344 --> 14:47.804
<i>When two adults wish to procreate</i>

14:47.888 --> 14:50.516
<i>They lay together
and copulate</i>

14:50.516 --> 14:53.310
<i>Male gametes, spermatozoa</i>

14:53.310 --> 14:55.646
<i>Implant themselves
in the ladies' ova!</i>

14:55.646 --> 14:56.855
<i>Break it down!</i>

14:58.023 --> 14:59.233
<i>I'm sorry, don't you need</i>

14:59.233 --> 15:02.486
to actually have had sex
in order to explain it?

15:02.486 --> 15:06.698
Professor Infosaurus also has
a rap about ignoring bullies.

15:07.991 --> 15:09.826
Robin? Birds and bees?

15:09.910 --> 15:11.995
Well, I, for one, don't think

15:12.079 --> 15:13.830
you have to teach Marvin
a thing.

15:13.914 --> 15:18.627
If he's anything like his dad,
he's a natural-born stud.

15:18.627 --> 15:20.712
Lily got a little braggy

15:20.796 --> 15:23.131
at a cucumber stand once, big guy.

15:24.132 --> 15:25.217
Robin wins again!

15:25.217 --> 15:27.636
- Oh, come on!
- That's clearly pandering!

15:27.636 --> 15:29.096
Lily, a spin...

15:29.096 --> 15:31.265
that... wheel!

15:31.265 --> 15:32.808
<i>We played long into the night,</i>

15:32.808 --> 15:34.852
<i>eventually making it
to the dreaded...</i>

15:34.852 --> 15:36.478
Lightning round!

15:41.149 --> 15:42.943
First word!

15:42.943 --> 15:45.571
- Oh. Ooh...
- Beam.

15:45.571 --> 15:47.447
Actually, that's a joist,

15:47.531 --> 15:49.116
which carries the stress
of the ceiling

15:49.116 --> 15:51.410
versus the primary
architectural load.

15:51.410 --> 15:52.661
But that's my boy!

15:52.661 --> 15:53.871
Ooh.

15:53.871 --> 15:55.664
Nerd!

15:55.664 --> 15:57.291
That's my boy!

15:57.291 --> 15:59.418
<i>First heartbreak!</i>

15:59.418 --> 16:01.795
I know this hurts,
little buddy,

16:01.879 --> 16:03.463
but you'll love again someday,

16:03.547 --> 16:06.300
because time will heal
a broken heart.

16:06.300 --> 16:09.386
But not that bitch's window.

16:09.386 --> 16:11.138
Run!

16:13.557 --> 16:14.683
<i>Yeah, right.</i>

16:14.683 --> 16:15.976
I've seen Barney throw.

16:15.976 --> 16:18.520
He's no Vinnie Pestano,
am I right?

16:20.230 --> 16:23.108
Beloved Indians'
middle reliever.

16:23.192 --> 16:25.152
Cleveland sports
are still relevant.

16:25.152 --> 16:28.113
LeBron who? Right, guys?

16:28.197 --> 16:30.157
Ted, neither you nor Cleveland

16:30.157 --> 16:32.075
knows how to get over
someone leaving them.

16:33.202 --> 16:34.870
Here's how you'd
handle heartbreak.

16:34.870 --> 16:39.041
Cheer up, squirt.

16:39.041 --> 16:40.334
There are plenty of other
wonderful women out there.

16:40.334 --> 16:43.045
But I thought
that she was the one.

16:46.089 --> 16:47.674
I'll be at
Uncle Barney's.

16:48.759 --> 16:50.511
This is ridiculous.

16:50.511 --> 16:52.304
I've known you for 16 years.

16:52.304 --> 16:53.722
I'm the obvious choice.

16:53.722 --> 16:55.557
Oh, come on,
if Ted raises him,

16:55.641 --> 16:58.101
the poor kid's still gonna
be a virgin when he's 13.

16:58.185 --> 17:01.063
- I'm the obvious choice.
- Hey, look, as the only one of us

17:01.063 --> 17:03.023
packing a vag, I got
a natural instinct

17:03.023 --> 17:04.775
for nurturing
and crap like that.

17:04.775 --> 17:06.485
Plus, I can teach him
how to bow hunt.

17:06.485 --> 17:09.112
- Yeah, I could do that.
- I am Barney Stinson!

17:11.657 --> 17:12.741
Guys, guys, guys!

17:12.741 --> 17:14.785
Okay!
All right!

17:14.785 --> 17:17.162
Obviously, none of you knows
what it really means

17:17.246 --> 17:18.580
to be a parent.

17:18.664 --> 17:20.958
Well... obviously, neither of you

17:20.958 --> 17:22.876
know what it means
to be a friend anymore.

17:24.294 --> 17:25.879
What are you
talking about?

17:25.963 --> 17:27.089
Think about it.

17:27.089 --> 17:28.966
This is the most
we've seen you two

17:28.966 --> 17:30.634
in five months.

17:30.634 --> 17:31.927
You don't seem to care

17:31.927 --> 17:33.136
what's going on
in our lives

17:33.220 --> 17:35.389
unless it's
an eight or higher.

17:35.389 --> 17:37.099
Well, what do you expect?

17:37.099 --> 17:38.892
- We have a baby now.
- Yeah.

17:38.976 --> 17:41.770
The days of closing down
MacLaren's are over.

17:41.854 --> 17:44.606
Unless you want to get up with us
at 5:13 in the morning

17:44.690 --> 17:46.275
with a screaming baby.

17:46.275 --> 17:47.860
So that's it?

17:47.860 --> 17:50.320
The... the end of an era,
just like that?

17:50.404 --> 17:53.866
Look... we're sorry
if-if we don't have time

17:53.866 --> 17:57.744
to sit around the bar listening
to silly little dating problems.

17:58.954 --> 18:00.539
When you have a baby,

18:00.539 --> 18:03.500
it's not just the most
important thing in your life,

18:03.584 --> 18:05.169
it's the only
important thing.

18:05.169 --> 18:07.087
When are you guys
gonna get that?

18:08.172 --> 18:09.423
Think we get it.

18:20.559 --> 18:23.020
I can't believe
they just walked out.

18:23.020 --> 18:25.564
Yeah. Maybe it's
for the best.

18:25.564 --> 18:27.858
Barney was starting
to pull ahead.

18:27.858 --> 18:29.610
I mean, how selfish can they be?

18:29.610 --> 18:31.612
We're trying to raise
a child here.

18:31.612 --> 18:34.281
I'm sorry if I don't have time
to deal with Ted's...

18:34.281 --> 18:37.993
um... o-or Robin's...

18:37.993 --> 18:39.453
um...

18:39.453 --> 18:41.705
or-or Barney's...

18:41.705 --> 18:43.332
mm...

18:43.332 --> 18:44.958
Huh.

18:48.295 --> 18:51.798
You know, we were about to name
one of them Marvin's godparent,

18:51.882 --> 18:54.009
and... I can't tell you

18:54.009 --> 18:56.345
what's going on
in any of their lives.

19:01.099 --> 19:03.435
Do you think that maybe

19:03.519 --> 19:06.271
we've been a little crappy
as friends lately?

19:11.985 --> 19:13.570
Do you really know
how to bow hunt?

19:13.654 --> 19:15.030
Um, yeah.

19:15.030 --> 19:17.449
At the British Columbia
Military School for Boys

19:17.533 --> 19:19.576
we called it "making lunch."

19:19.660 --> 19:21.203
Hey, guys.

19:21.203 --> 19:23.247
We asked Mickey
to watch Marvin

19:23.247 --> 19:24.790
so we could come
down and talk.

19:24.790 --> 19:28.544
I know that we didn't get
to finish the game, but...

19:28.544 --> 19:30.462
we've reached a decision.

19:30.546 --> 19:31.880
Lily?

19:33.090 --> 19:34.883
We've decided...

19:36.760 --> 19:39.429
to revoke the
"eight or higher" rule.

19:39.513 --> 19:41.098
TED/ROBIN/What?

19:41.098 --> 19:43.767
We want to know everything
that's going on with you guys.

19:43.851 --> 19:46.103
- Really?
- You're our best friends.

19:46.103 --> 19:48.647
Everything is an eight
or higher.

19:50.732 --> 19:52.985
<i>And for the first time
in almost half a year,</i>

19:52.985 --> 19:56.488
<i>Lily and Marshall
closed down MacLaren's.</i>

19:56.572 --> 19:59.449
Anyway, Victoria's dad and I are
working out a payment plan

19:59.533 --> 20:01.535
with a very reasonable
interest rate.

20:03.704 --> 20:05.873
At least, Nick's bike
is fuel-efficient... we're getting, like,

20:05.873 --> 20:08.041
30, 35 miles to the cob.

20:08.125 --> 20:09.626
- Really?
- Yeah.

20:09.710 --> 20:11.962
You know, I should've told you
about that six and a half sooner.

20:11.962 --> 20:14.673
Barney Stinson banging
anything less than an eight?

20:14.673 --> 20:16.842
That's like a 15.

20:16.842 --> 20:18.886
<i>And it was a great night.</i>

20:18.886 --> 20:20.721
<i>Until...</i>

20:25.559 --> 20:28.520
Go back to bed.

20:28.604 --> 20:29.938
We got this.

20:37.237 --> 20:39.323
<i>And Lily and Marshall
finally decided</i>

20:39.323 --> 20:40.657
<i>on a guardian.</i>

20:40.741 --> 20:42.576
- Are you sure about this, baby?
- Yes.

20:42.576 --> 20:46.121
No matter what happens, I want
Marvin to stay in the family.

20:57.758 --> 20:59.718
Oh...

21:01.136 --> 21:02.971
Is that a bowling ball
in a onesie?

21:04.056 --> 21:05.516
Run!
