16:30.155 --> 16:32.116
You have a stuffed giraffe too?

16:32.199 --> 16:34.243
{\an3}- No, but I have
a giraffe cerebrum

16:34.326 --> 16:35.077
soaking in formaldehyde.

You use funny words, Lisa.

Who wants to start?

16:45.003 --> 16:47.172
{\an3}- Ooh, ohh!
I have something to share.

16:47.256 --> 16:48.882
It's my new friend, Lisa.

16:48.966 --> 16:50.426

16:50.509 --> 16:52.052
And great social skills, Lisa.

16:52.136 --> 16:55.264
{\an1}You just turned
that F into an A.

16:56.849 --> 16:59.810
- Now that
my academic record is secure,

16:59.893 --> 17:01.311
and my seat on

17:01.395 --> 17:03.063
the interplanetary council
is solidified,

17:03.147 --> 17:05.523
I can return to
my beloved research.

17:05.607 --> 17:08.569
Have you missed me,
electron microscope?

17:08.652 --> 17:10.820
- Hi, new friend.

17:10.904 --> 17:13.781
- Oh, uh, [stammers] right.

17:13.866 --> 17:15.367
Greetings, Darcy.

17:15.451 --> 17:17.411
- Are we playing
scientist today?

17:17.493 --> 17:19.288
You always make it look so fun.

17:19.371 --> 17:21.790
{\an3}- [squeals]
This isn't really playing.

17:21.874 --> 17:26.127
It's complex and
potentially dangerous research.

17:26.211 --> 17:30.466
Uh--maybe we can engage in
play and/or sport later.

17:30.549 --> 17:31.467
- Oh, okay.

17:31.550 --> 17:34.261
{\an1}I'll save you a spot
on the seesaw at recess.

17:34.344 --> 17:35.679
- Slight complication.

17:35.763 --> 17:37.514
I failed to consider
that the subject

17:37.598 --> 17:38.807
might wish to remain friends

17:38.891 --> 17:41.143

she did help me secure that A.

17:50.861 --> 17:53.447
- Hi, giraffe twin.

17:53.530 --> 17:54.948
Rafo wants to play.

17:55.032 --> 17:55.949
Did you bring your giraffe?

17:56.033 --> 17:59.369
- Eh, mine does not travel well.

17:59.453 --> 18:02.247
Now, if you don't mind,
I do need my REM sleep.

18:02.331 --> 18:02.998
{\an1}I have a lot of
short-term memories

18:03.081 --> 18:06.126
I need to convert to long-term.

18:06.210 --> 18:07.294
Oh, tell you what.

18:07.377 --> 18:08.962
You, Rafo, and I can circle back

18:09.046 --> 18:10.964
to that playdate post slumber.

18:11.048 --> 18:13.175

18:23.519 --> 18:26.688
{\an3}Lisa!
My dad packed two cookies today.

18:26.772 --> 18:29.107
{\an3}One for me and
one for my new friend.

18:29.191 --> 18:30.692
- Oh, that is very generous,

18:30.776 --> 18:32.903

18:32.986 --> 18:35.072

We can still sit together.

{\an1}- Eh--actually,
if you don't mind,

18:43.705 --> 18:46.708
{\an1}I was hoping to use snack time
to brush up on my Mandarin.

18:46.792 --> 18:48.377
{\an1}I have a video conference
coming up

18:48.460 --> 18:50.128

in craft time.

19:12.526 --> 19:15.779
- What is this bizarre shackle?

19:15.863 --> 19:17.239
- A friendship bracelet.

19:17.322 --> 19:19.283
{\an1}I can show you how to make one
for me too.

19:19.366 --> 19:21.326
{\an1}And then we can
be bracelet twins.

{\an1}- I know it looks hard,
but I can help you.

19:29.001 --> 19:30.460
- No-no-no-no.

19:30.544 --> 19:32.421
See, you're a great kid, but

19:32.504 --> 19:34.840
my lifestyle
isn't really conducive

19:34.923 --> 19:36.258
to having friends.

19:36.341 --> 19:38.343
To be perfectly frank,
I sought you out

19:38.427 --> 19:40.637
to improve
my grade in Social Skills.

19:40.721 --> 19:42.764
Now that that objective
has been achieved,

19:42.848 --> 19:44.975
I feel it would be best
for both of us

19:45.058 --> 19:47.311
if we went our separate ways.

19:47.394 --> 19:50.522
{\an3}I do appreciate
your assistance, though.

I understand that

20:37.402 --> 20:39.279
{\an3}friendship is
an academic requirement,

20:39.363 --> 20:40.489

I just don't see
the point of it.
