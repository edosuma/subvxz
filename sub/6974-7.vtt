the U.S. Embassy.

you home, I guess.

You know what I think,

in your best interest.

at the border crossing
in Laredo, Texas.

15:46.970 --> 15:51.031
It was taken at 12:50 a.m.
On the morning of the fourth.

We're sure this is Doggett?

15:52.509 --> 15:54.272
It's been scanned
to Agent Reyes.

15:54.377 --> 15:55.867
She also believes it is him.

15:55.979 --> 15:59.142
I'd say this reshapes
the investigation.

ofTexas...

16:19.169 --> 16:22.002

a waste of effort.

16:22.105 --> 16:26.201

lock, stock and barrel into Mexico...

16:26.309 --> 16:28.539

strength of this.

16:28.645 --> 16:32.012

federal police.

Doggett's in their
jurisdiction, not ours.

believe it or not...

16:38.221 --> 16:41.213
I want to find him
as badly as you do.

are already taxed...

16:44.361 --> 16:46.488

security concerns.

Agent Reyes is still
in San Antonio.

16:55.805 --> 16:58.968
She was raised in Mexico.

16:59.075 --> 17:01.839
She could offer the federal
police some on-site help.

17:01.945 --> 17:04.277
She can help them all she wants.

17:06.516 --> 17:09.246

17:57.600 --> 18:01.092
My partner, John Doggett, was
investigating his disappearance.

18:01.204 --> 18:02.228
I'm betting
my partner...

18:02.338 --> 18:03.737

18:03.840 --> 18:05.205

Two weeks ago.

No, sorry.

I don't remember any person
named Doggett.

18:12.415 --> 18:14.713
Agent, I don't quite know
what you're implying.

18:14.818 --> 18:16.251
Mr. Molina's an upstanding

18:17.787 --> 18:19.584

18:22.392 --> 18:24.519
I'll tell you
what's clear to me.

18:24.627 --> 18:27.653
You're some kind of middleman
in a smuggling operation.

18:27.764 --> 18:29.732
Hollis Rice laundered money
for your cartel...

18:29.833 --> 18:31.095
until something went wrong.

18:31.201 --> 18:33.396
Maybe he got greedy,
maybe he talked too much.

18:33.503 --> 18:34.902
Your cartel made
him disappear.

18:39.175 --> 18:41.075

whatever it takes.

18:41.177 --> 18:42.735
Your only personal
hope for the future...

18:42.846 --> 18:43.835
is that I
find him alive.

18:43.947 --> 18:45.915
Now where is he?

somebody somewhere...

The 24th Marine Amphibious Unit.
