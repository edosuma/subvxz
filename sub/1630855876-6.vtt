00:01.869 --> 00:04.236
(mysterious music)

00:46.614 --> 00:49.147
(julia): The society
of the flourishing self.

00:49.183 --> 00:51.683
It's an unusual name
for a health retreat.

00:51.685 --> 00:53.552
- Trust me.
You're going to love it.

00:53.621 --> 00:56.421
(chuckles)
- I'm certainly curious.

00:57.224 --> 00:59.624
I have to say, though,

00:59.660 --> 01:00.893
Place like this, effie,

01:01.028 --> 01:03.128
It seems like an unusual
fit for you.

01:03.295 --> 01:05.264
- I'd have said the same
a month ago.

01:05.464 --> 01:07.433
It's hard to describe,
but ever since I started

01:07.634 --> 01:09.635
Coming here, I just feel upbeat!

01:09.770 --> 01:11.936
- Well, it could be partially
due to being out of the city.

01:11.972 --> 01:14.373
- I believe some of it's due
to the country air,

01:14.508 --> 01:17.242
But it's mostly this teacher
and the practices he's invented.

01:18.278 --> 01:19.811
- I wouldn't trust 'em
if you asked me.

01:20.815 --> 01:22.481
- Oh, why do you say that?

01:22.483 --> 01:24.082
- Well...

01:24.217 --> 01:26.451
They ain't very considerate
neighbours, for a start.

01:26.454 --> 01:27.719
- Oh, you live around here?

01:27.788 --> 01:29.988
- Next property over.
- Oh.

01:30.024 --> 01:32.591
- Them folks ain't nothing
but a bunch of misfits.

01:32.660 --> 01:33.925
(curious music)

01:33.961 --> 01:37.896
- The society is a bit
unorthodox,

01:37.932 --> 01:40.199
But, uh, the practices speak
for themselves.

01:40.334 --> 01:41.567
Come, julia.

01:44.004 --> 01:46.338
- I fear we may be overdressed.

01:46.473 --> 01:49.341
- Yes, the attire does require
some getting used to.

01:49.476 --> 01:50.708
- Detective watts?

01:50.744 --> 01:52.478
- I didn't realize you were
a member of the society.

01:52.613 --> 01:53.679
- Well--
- I've never seen

01:53.814 --> 01:54.746
You here before.

01:54.815 --> 01:56.148
- I'm not a member,
though I have visited

01:56.283 --> 01:57.482
A number of times.

01:57.485 --> 02:00.152
I'm intrigued by the teacher's
idea of a unified self.

02:00.287 --> 02:01.820
- What exactly is that?

02:01.889 --> 02:03.555
- A self with no secrets.

02:03.690 --> 02:05.757
- Good morning, everyone!

02:05.826 --> 02:07.625
My name is setia.

02:07.661 --> 02:09.561
I'm serigalo's assistant.

02:09.696 --> 02:11.263
A welcome session
with the teacher

02:11.332 --> 02:12.830
Will begin shortly in the hall,

02:12.867 --> 02:14.433
But in the meantime,

02:14.568 --> 02:16.634
Non-residents should change
into their whites

02:16.670 --> 02:18.770
And choose seeker names.

02:18.839 --> 02:21.039
- Non-residents?
People live here?

02:21.075 --> 02:22.975
- Those who require
a more intensive experience

02:22.977 --> 02:24.442
Can stay as long as they like.

02:24.444 --> 02:25.910
- Like a sanatorium?

02:25.946 --> 02:27.445
- No, like a retreat.

02:28.415 --> 02:30.048
- And what exactly
is a seeker name?

02:30.050 --> 02:31.916
- A word you choose
that embodies

02:31.952 --> 02:33.118
What you're looking
to gain here.

02:33.253 --> 02:34.586
It's how the teacher
and everyone else

02:34.588 --> 02:35.854
Will refer to you.

02:35.989 --> 02:38.056
- How fascinating.

02:40.127 --> 02:42.327
(soft magical music)

02:42.462 --> 02:44.596
(indistinct chatter)

02:49.803 --> 02:52.337
- I never thought I'd miss
the structure of a corset.

02:52.406 --> 02:54.206
- It does take some
getting used to,

02:54.208 --> 02:55.940
But you'll be grateful
for the freedom of movement

02:55.976 --> 02:57.275
Once classes begin.

02:58.045 --> 02:59.077
- Welcome.

02:59.213 --> 03:00.212
- Thank you.

03:00.347 --> 03:01.379
- Welcome.

03:02.349 --> 03:03.281
- He's here.

03:04.685 --> 03:05.750
- Oh my.

03:05.786 --> 03:07.619
- Yes, he cuts quite
a figure, doesn't he?

03:07.688 --> 03:09.688
- What on earth is he wearing?

03:09.690 --> 03:12.224
- Serigalo says it's a...

03:12.226 --> 03:13.825
Traditional garment
from india.

03:15.229 --> 03:17.095
- It is hot there.

03:17.131 --> 03:20.432
I suppose it's designed
to keep them cool?

03:22.536 --> 03:23.701
- Ah!

03:23.737 --> 03:25.771
My dear joy. Welcome back.

03:25.906 --> 03:28.072
(breathing deeply)

03:28.108 --> 03:29.074
(chuckles)

03:30.210 --> 03:31.709
- And harmony.

03:31.745 --> 03:33.245
Wonderful to see you.

03:33.380 --> 03:34.846
- The pleasure is mine.
(serigalo chuckles)

03:37.051 --> 03:39.484
- And you are?
- Oh! Dr. Julia ogden.

03:39.486 --> 03:42.120
- Oh. I mean your seeker name.

03:42.122 --> 03:43.989
- Oh! Uh...

03:44.124 --> 03:46.858
- Come, julia.
You get to choose a name.

03:47.795 --> 03:51.195
- Oh, oh,
well. Uh, I'm-I'm here--

03:51.232 --> 03:55.067
- Ah! Seeking presence
in the present.

03:55.202 --> 03:58.403
(scoffs)
a lofty aspiration.

03:58.405 --> 03:59.538
Welcome!

04:00.941 --> 04:01.873
Here.

04:03.978 --> 04:05.810
And welcome, seekers.

04:05.846 --> 04:08.747
I am serigalo.

04:08.749 --> 04:11.416
I founded this society
after traveling the world

04:11.551 --> 04:12.950
For many years

04:12.987 --> 04:16.021
In search of a means
of unifying my heart...

04:16.090 --> 04:17.922
And mind,

04:17.992 --> 04:20.825
Which were often at odds.

04:20.861 --> 04:24.229
The teachings I offer
are practices I created,

04:24.364 --> 04:28.199
Which gave me the unification
I was seeking.

04:29.336 --> 04:32.037
Movement to strengthen the body.
(all inhaling)

04:32.839 --> 04:35.039
Guided contemplation...

04:35.075 --> 04:36.408
To centre the mind.

04:37.845 --> 04:39.277
(inhaling deeply)

04:39.313 --> 04:41.046
Breathwork...

04:41.048 --> 04:43.948
To unleash the spirit

04:44.018 --> 04:46.517
And unbosoming...

04:46.553 --> 04:47.919
To know the heart.

04:49.556 --> 04:52.523
Learn these practices
and I promise you, too,

04:52.559 --> 04:53.825
Can be unified.

04:54.662 --> 04:56.795
(woman whimpering)

04:56.864 --> 04:59.197
(breathing heavily)

05:00.634 --> 05:01.966
(julia): Dear god!

05:02.036 --> 05:03.302
- Setia, get help.

05:03.437 --> 05:04.736
- She's not breathing.

05:07.007 --> 05:08.340
Dear god.

05:09.543 --> 05:10.475
She's dead.

05:10.477 --> 05:11.710
(gasping)

05:12.746 --> 05:14.379
(tense music)

05:17.084 --> 05:19.817
- I'm so sorry that such
an upsetting occurrence

05:19.853 --> 05:22.153
Has marred your first visit
to the society.

05:22.189 --> 05:24.055
- Had she been ill at all?

05:24.058 --> 05:25.624
- Not that I know of.

05:25.626 --> 05:27.425
- And what was her legal name?

05:27.561 --> 05:29.795
- So many questions.
What are you? A detective?

05:29.797 --> 05:31.697
- Yes. Outside this community,

05:31.832 --> 05:34.165
I'm a member of
the toronto constabulary.

05:34.201 --> 05:35.934
- Oh! I see.

05:37.037 --> 05:38.837
Do you suspect foul play?

05:38.906 --> 05:42.574
- I'm just gathering information
to help local authorities.

05:42.576 --> 05:44.609
- Her name was alison becken.

05:44.745 --> 05:47.111
- When was the last time
either of you spoke to her?

05:47.147 --> 05:48.847
- Uh, this morning.

05:48.916 --> 05:51.516
She was planning on foregoing
the welcome ceremony

05:51.651 --> 05:54.252
To... Practise her breathwork.

05:55.189 --> 05:56.588
- And what exactly
is breathwork?

05:56.657 --> 05:59.825
- It's a form
of deep and rapid breathing.

05:59.960 --> 06:01.526
It's beneficial
for self-awareness,

06:01.595 --> 06:04.262
Emotional release and clarity.

06:04.331 --> 06:07.198
- Speaking of, we need to plan
for the rest of the day,

06:07.234 --> 06:09.200
Considering what happened.

06:09.236 --> 06:10.668
You'll call the police?

06:10.738 --> 06:11.937
- I will.

06:11.939 --> 06:13.271
(indistinct murmurs)

06:15.275 --> 06:18.076
Though I doubt anyone
will make it out today.

06:19.213 --> 06:20.612
- Then I suppose it's up to us

06:20.681 --> 06:23.414
To determine what happened
to miss becken.

06:23.450 --> 06:25.349
- I'm curious about
this breathwork.

06:25.386 --> 06:27.752
It sounds akin
to controlled hyperventilation.

06:27.755 --> 06:29.487
- Mm. I've tried it
once or twice.

06:29.556 --> 06:31.223
That's a fair definition of it.

06:31.358 --> 06:32.757
- Well, it sounds like it
could be dangerous.

06:32.826 --> 06:34.826
- N-no, not at all.

06:34.828 --> 06:37.496
Serigalo would never teach
something that would cause harm.

06:37.631 --> 06:38.864
- Well, perhaps not knowingly,

06:38.999 --> 06:40.766
But bodies can react
in surprising ways

06:40.901 --> 06:42.434
To extreme experiences.

06:42.436 --> 06:44.369
I'd like to do a more
thorough examination.

06:44.438 --> 06:46.438
- In the meantime,
I'll ask around,

06:46.507 --> 06:48.773
Try to get a sense of alison's
movements this morning.

06:48.842 --> 06:52.444
- I think we should inquire
into her state of mind, as well.

06:52.513 --> 06:54.245
There must have been a reason
why she chose to do

06:54.314 --> 06:57.182
This breathwork instead of
attending the welcome session.

06:58.752 --> 07:00.552
- How long did you know alison?

07:01.588 --> 07:02.654
Oneness.

07:02.789 --> 07:04.088
- Six weeks.

07:05.192 --> 07:07.592
We've shared a cabin
since I arrived.

07:07.661 --> 07:08.927
- Did you get on well?

07:09.062 --> 07:10.796
- We were very close.

07:11.765 --> 07:13.397
The society is like a family.

07:13.434 --> 07:15.867
- And how did she seem
this morning?

07:16.002 --> 07:17.936
- She'd returned to the cabin

07:17.938 --> 07:20.005
After I'd gone to sleep
last night and...

07:20.007 --> 07:21.806
Was up and out when I woke up.

07:21.875 --> 07:23.141
- Is that unusual?

07:24.778 --> 07:27.078
- She'd been having extra
sessions with serigalo.

07:27.915 --> 07:29.147
- What-what kind of sessions?

07:30.884 --> 07:31.749
- I wouldn't know.

07:32.986 --> 07:34.685
- How long had she been here?

07:34.721 --> 07:36.888
- Seven or eight months,
I think.

07:36.924 --> 07:38.490
(julia scoffs)
- that's a long time

07:38.625 --> 07:40.091
To be removed from the world.

07:40.160 --> 07:41.426
- May seem so.

07:42.762 --> 07:44.629
But it can be necessary
for a sensitive soul

07:44.665 --> 07:46.031
Like oneness.

07:46.166 --> 07:47.866
That's why I created
the society.

07:48.635 --> 07:50.201
To give people solace.

07:51.672 --> 07:54.372
- Society has changed
my life, serigalo.

07:54.374 --> 07:55.440
Truly.

07:56.677 --> 07:59.878
- Ah, but what is the goal?

08:00.914 --> 08:02.781
Do your teachings

08:02.916 --> 08:04.716
Strengthen these sensitive souls

08:04.851 --> 08:06.551
So as to return
to the real world?

08:07.621 --> 08:09.187
- You don't think
this is the real world?

08:09.923 --> 08:10.856
- Well, uh...

08:10.991 --> 08:12.323
- That tells me that
you're not yet

08:12.359 --> 08:14.526
Present in the present,

08:14.661 --> 08:15.794
Here.

08:22.536 --> 08:24.202
(indistinct chatter)

08:27.541 --> 08:29.807
(brackenreid): Ah! Just the man
I wanted to see.

08:29.843 --> 08:31.076
- Morning, sir.

08:31.211 --> 08:32.611
I just came by to get this.

08:32.613 --> 08:33.811
- Is that right?

08:33.813 --> 08:36.414
- Yes. Julia is at
a health retreat in huntsville,

08:36.416 --> 08:38.216
So I thought I would
take the opportunity

08:38.218 --> 08:39.884
To give my bicycle a tune-up.

08:39.887 --> 08:40.885
- That'll be quick work.

08:40.921 --> 08:42.754
You'll have more than
enough time for this.

08:45.058 --> 08:46.691
- Nathaniel ryther,

08:46.693 --> 08:48.360
3 gracevale street.

08:48.495 --> 08:49.760
What's this about?

08:49.796 --> 08:51.763
- Ryther is a friend of mine
from the masons.

08:51.765 --> 08:53.331
His wife's disappeared.

08:53.400 --> 08:56.701
You're to find her
and bring her home discreetly.

08:57.771 --> 08:58.870
Is there a problem, murdoch?

09:00.007 --> 09:01.238
- Not at all, sir.

09:01.275 --> 09:02.874
- Good. Because ryther's
expecting you

09:03.009 --> 09:04.442
In half an hour. Good luck.

09:04.444 --> 09:05.977
(curious music)

09:07.381 --> 09:08.846
(sighs)

09:10.651 --> 09:11.583
- Are you all right?

09:13.020 --> 09:15.353
- As long as we live,
we are blessed.

09:17.724 --> 09:19.523
But I must admit
I am feeling the loss

09:19.560 --> 09:21.626
Of oneness very acutely.

09:22.696 --> 09:25.063
- Perhaps you should
try some stretching?

09:25.999 --> 09:27.198
As you said,
intentional movement

09:27.267 --> 09:30.635
Is a good way to process--
- process emotions. Yes.

09:33.040 --> 09:34.739
How wonderful to have
your teachings

09:34.741 --> 09:37.342
Reflect back from your students.

09:37.411 --> 09:38.810
- That's a beautiful ring.

09:39.746 --> 09:41.980
Is it significant in some way?

09:44.084 --> 09:45.483
- It is a reminder...

09:47.487 --> 09:50.455
Of why I-I do this work.

09:54.328 --> 09:56.961
Freedom will miss sharing
a cabin with oneness.

09:56.964 --> 09:58.296
Perhaps you could stay with her?

09:59.366 --> 10:01.833
She could use your energy.

10:04.204 --> 10:05.536
(water trickling)

10:07.341 --> 10:08.907
(door opens)

10:09.776 --> 10:11.442
- Hm. You've gotten right to it.

10:11.511 --> 10:12.910
(sighs)
- I didn't intend

10:12.946 --> 10:14.512
On doing an internal
examination,

10:14.648 --> 10:17.115
But... Once I found this...

10:17.250 --> 10:18.350
- What's this?

10:18.485 --> 10:20.451
- It's a mix of blood
and saliva.

10:20.520 --> 10:22.654
I found it in
the victim's mouth and throat,

10:22.656 --> 10:24.522
Which got me curious.

10:24.591 --> 10:26.658
It suggests she died
of asphyxiation.

10:26.793 --> 10:28.592
- She choked on something?

10:28.629 --> 10:29.861
- That's the interesting thing.

10:29.930 --> 10:34.065
I found no signs of
a foreign body in her windpipe.

10:34.200 --> 10:36.368
I believe the asphyxia
was due to poisoning.

10:36.503 --> 10:38.202
- Poisoning? By what?

10:39.940 --> 10:41.606
- The spasms before she died

10:41.608 --> 10:43.474
Suggest some kind of paralytic,

10:43.510 --> 10:46.211
Perhaps water hemlock,
or strychnine?

10:46.346 --> 10:49.547
- Neither of which is something
someone would ingest willingly.

10:49.549 --> 10:52.884
- Well, exactly.
Meaning this was a murder.

10:54.954 --> 10:56.254
- Eleanor took a trip
to niagara falls

10:56.323 --> 10:58.089
A month and a half ago
but never returned.

11:00.093 --> 11:01.693
- May I ask, mr. Ryther,

11:01.762 --> 11:04.229
Why you've waited until now
to look for her?

11:05.298 --> 11:06.564
- I presumed she'd come
home eventually.

11:07.701 --> 11:09.834
- But something's
changed your mind?

11:09.836 --> 11:11.502
- A wire transfer
withdrawing funds

11:11.571 --> 11:13.505
From our household account
earlier this week.

11:15.642 --> 11:17.041
- And you took that as a sign

11:17.077 --> 11:19.844
That your wife wasn't planning
on coming home?

11:19.913 --> 11:22.847
- I took it as a sign eleanor's
being held under duress.

11:22.916 --> 11:24.849
She knows better
than to make a transaction

11:24.851 --> 11:26.451
Like that without my permission.

11:29.256 --> 11:31.723
- Very well. I'll do my best
to get to the bottom of this.

11:31.792 --> 11:33.858
- Yes, see that you do.

11:35.362 --> 11:37.261
Here's a photograph of eleanor
for your reference.

11:38.465 --> 11:39.664
- Thank you.

11:39.799 --> 11:43.067
I'll begin by having
a detailed look at this room.

11:43.136 --> 11:44.335
- Do as you please.

11:47.874 --> 11:49.340
(effie): Someone poisoned her?

11:49.342 --> 11:50.809
- Keep your voice down.

11:50.811 --> 11:52.277
- We're alone in the woods,
julia.

11:52.412 --> 11:54.479
- Well, be that as it may,
we don't know anyone here

11:54.548 --> 11:56.013
Well enough to know
who we can trust.

11:57.150 --> 11:58.883
- I spoke to two people
who said our victim

11:58.952 --> 12:01.152
Had an argument
with serigalo last night.

12:01.287 --> 12:02.954
- You're not suggesting
he killed her, are you?

12:02.956 --> 12:04.889
- I'm not suggesting anything.

12:04.891 --> 12:08.225
- Well, this serigalo does have
an intense sway over people.

12:08.261 --> 12:10.427
- That's not evidence
of wrongdoing.

12:10.464 --> 12:12.096
- True, but it's not
very healthy,

12:12.165 --> 12:15.500
Especially for those
susceptible to undue influence.

12:15.569 --> 12:17.101
- People believe
in his teachings.

12:17.137 --> 12:18.970
That doesn't mean
he's bewitched them.

12:19.039 --> 12:20.438
- Well, I didn't say
that it does,

12:20.507 --> 12:22.974
But if he fought
with alison, then--

12:23.109 --> 12:25.109
- And what was this
supposed fight about?

12:25.178 --> 12:26.644
- We don't know, as of yet.

12:26.780 --> 12:29.246
- Then I suggest we not
get ahead of ourselves.

12:29.282 --> 12:30.447
- Mm.

12:30.484 --> 12:32.984
- Forgive me, effie,
but I'm not sure

12:33.053 --> 12:34.919
You're entirely objective

12:34.988 --> 12:37.255
When it comes to the matter
of serigalo.

12:38.959 --> 12:40.325
- Excuse me?

12:40.460 --> 12:42.059
- I've seen the way
you look at him.

12:43.096 --> 12:45.129
- And what is it
you're suggesting, julia?

12:45.132 --> 12:46.730
- Movement class begins
in ten minutes.

12:46.767 --> 12:47.999
- Oh.

12:48.001 --> 12:49.267
- Thank you, stillness.

12:49.336 --> 12:51.702
Think I'll go
and freshen up first.

12:53.473 --> 12:54.739
- Surely you see it, too.

12:55.542 --> 12:56.608
She's enamoured with him.

12:56.743 --> 12:58.876
- She was rather passionate
in her defense,

12:58.912 --> 13:01.745
But it's george
she's truly enamoured with.

13:01.782 --> 13:03.815
- Well, george is away

13:03.950 --> 13:06.784
And we all have
moments of weakness.

13:09.556 --> 13:11.355
(birds chirping)

13:11.424 --> 13:13.291
(sighs)

13:17.964 --> 13:19.764
(knocking)

13:19.899 --> 13:21.966
This will be a nice step up

13:22.101 --> 13:24.335
From the tent
we were meant to share.

13:25.372 --> 13:27.572
- Well, I sincerely hope
you don't think

13:27.574 --> 13:29.306
Serigalo's undue influence

13:29.342 --> 13:30.774
Had anything to do
with me agreeing

13:30.811 --> 13:32.043
To room with freedom.

13:34.247 --> 13:35.647
- I didn't mean to suggest

13:35.649 --> 13:39.784
That you would really
let your fondness

13:39.919 --> 13:42.253
For him blind you. I-I...

13:42.388 --> 13:43.721
- I should hope not.

13:44.858 --> 13:47.024
- I just wonder...

13:47.060 --> 13:48.693
Whether you've come
to the society

13:48.762 --> 13:52.129
Seeking to fill the hole
left by george's absence.

13:52.165 --> 13:54.565
- This has nothing
to do with george, julia.

13:55.702 --> 13:56.834
This must be freedom's.

13:57.938 --> 14:00.537
(curious music)

14:00.574 --> 14:01.639
Julia.

14:04.144 --> 14:05.210
- What is it?

14:07.180 --> 14:08.546
Strychnine.

14:08.548 --> 14:09.614
- You don't think--?

14:09.683 --> 14:11.216
- What are you doing
in my things?!

14:14.087 --> 14:15.019
Those are mine.

14:16.156 --> 14:17.755
- Strychnine is quite poisonous.

14:17.891 --> 14:19.223
- Not according to my doctor.

14:20.393 --> 14:22.894
He gave these to me as a tonic
for my nerves.

14:22.896 --> 14:25.229
Not that I need them now,
thanks to serigalo.

14:26.533 --> 14:28.232
- Did oneness ever have
any of those tablets, freedom?

14:28.235 --> 14:29.500
- Of course not.

14:29.636 --> 14:31.703
A nerve tonic was
the last thing she needed.

14:32.639 --> 14:34.305
- She wasn't an anxious person?

14:34.440 --> 14:36.240
- The farthest thing from it.

14:36.309 --> 14:38.743
Why are you asking
these questions?

14:38.878 --> 14:40.678
- Oneness was poisoned.

14:40.747 --> 14:42.413
Possibly with strychnine.

14:43.216 --> 14:46.183
- And you...? You think I...

14:46.185 --> 14:47.118
Did it?

14:48.321 --> 14:51.522
- Well, I'll have to test
these tablets to be sure.

15:05.705 --> 15:07.805
- Do you really think she could
have poisoned alison?

15:07.807 --> 15:10.208
- Luckily, there's a simple way
to find out.

15:11.177 --> 15:13.745
Strychnine is insoluble
in water.

15:13.747 --> 15:17.448
The more this tablet dissolves,
the less strychnine is present.

15:22.756 --> 15:24.288
- It's disappeared completely.

15:25.492 --> 15:27.692
- Freedom's tonic doesn't
contain enough strychnine

15:27.761 --> 15:28.960
To harm anyone.

15:30.096 --> 15:31.763
- Then I believe
an apology is in order.

15:33.600 --> 15:37.168
- I assume you are familiar
with this room, miss...?

15:37.237 --> 15:39.503
- Franklin, sir.

15:39.539 --> 15:41.906
And I am. I've been
with the rythers for two years.

15:41.908 --> 15:45.843
- Does anything appear
to be missing or out of place,

15:45.845 --> 15:47.245
As far as you can tell?

15:47.247 --> 15:48.446
- No, sir.

15:48.448 --> 15:50.848
It's just as it was when
mrs. Ryther left on her trip.

15:51.918 --> 15:53.718
- And you've kept up
your cleaning duties

15:53.853 --> 15:56.321
Of this room while the lady
of the house has been gone?

15:56.456 --> 15:58.255
- I dusted just the other day.

15:58.291 --> 15:59.023
- Oh!

16:00.226 --> 16:02.593
Well, if that is the case,
miss franklin,

16:02.629 --> 16:04.729
Then perhaps you can
explain to me

16:04.731 --> 16:06.664
The significance of this.

16:09.602 --> 16:12.270
Something has clearly
been removed

16:12.405 --> 16:15.540
From this mantle
since you last dusted

16:15.675 --> 16:16.874
Just the other day.

16:16.943 --> 16:18.542
- Oh.

16:18.611 --> 16:19.744
How strange.

16:19.813 --> 16:21.145
- Hm.

16:21.147 --> 16:23.614
Perhaps we should ask
mr. Ryther about it?

16:25.819 --> 16:27.418
(breathing deeply)

16:28.488 --> 16:29.487
(serigalo): Good.

16:31.224 --> 16:32.423
Good.

16:32.492 --> 16:36.894
And arms wide as if
to capture the sun.

16:39.466 --> 16:40.431
And release.

16:41.501 --> 16:44.635
Bringing your hands together
and clasp...

16:44.771 --> 16:45.903
In the centre.

16:47.240 --> 16:48.339
And breathe.

16:48.474 --> 16:51.042
(all breathing deeply)

16:54.814 --> 16:57.181
May peace be in your mind

16:57.217 --> 16:58.716
And in your hearts.

17:00.420 --> 17:02.586
- For those of you here
for the first time,

17:02.655 --> 17:05.856
Recordings of serigalo's
guided contemplations

17:05.925 --> 17:07.992
Are available for purchase
in the office.

17:08.127 --> 17:10.194
- How entrepreneurial.

17:11.131 --> 17:12.063
- Shh.

17:12.866 --> 17:15.166
- Our apologies, calm.

17:18.104 --> 17:20.138
He's still working
on coming into alignment

17:20.273 --> 17:21.672
With his seeker name.

17:21.741 --> 17:22.874
- Clearly.

17:23.009 --> 17:24.741
- I noticed you two
were late to class. Did

17:24.778 --> 17:25.743
You find something?

17:25.878 --> 17:27.945
- Yes. Some tablets
in freedom's room

17:28.014 --> 17:29.146
That contained strychnine.

17:29.182 --> 17:30.148
- Oh?
- But not enough

17:30.150 --> 17:31.348
To kill anybody.

17:31.350 --> 17:32.216
- So not her.

17:32.285 --> 17:33.884
- No, but I'd still like

17:33.920 --> 17:36.954
To search the area where
alison does her breathwork.

17:37.023 --> 17:38.622
Perhaps there's
something there?

17:38.691 --> 17:40.491
- I want to speak with serigalo,

17:40.527 --> 17:42.493
Find out what he and alison
argued about last night.

17:42.628 --> 17:44.028
- I really don't think th--

17:46.165 --> 17:47.498
You know what? Never mind.

17:47.500 --> 17:50.301
You'll realize eventually
he has nothing to do with this.

17:53.372 --> 17:55.239
- Serigalo?

17:55.374 --> 17:56.574
(knocking)

18:10.056 --> 18:11.856
(sighs)

18:30.577 --> 18:31.876
(suspenseful music)

18:39.452 --> 18:41.352
(serigalo breathing deeply)

18:43.957 --> 18:45.289
(effie clears throat)

18:46.426 --> 18:48.159
- Joy. Here.

18:48.294 --> 18:50.093
- Sorry for interrupting you.

18:50.130 --> 18:52.763
- No, not at all. Please, sit.

18:59.772 --> 19:02.506
- I understand this
is where oneness

19:02.542 --> 19:04.008
Did her breathwork this morning.

19:04.077 --> 19:08.245
- Yes. I was hoping
to feel some of her energy.

19:09.449 --> 19:12.717
- I also understand that
you two argued last night.

19:14.320 --> 19:16.787
- We had a constructive
conversation

19:16.856 --> 19:18.389
Rooted in passion.

19:18.458 --> 19:21.325
- And what was this constructive
conversation about?

19:22.662 --> 19:24.996
- Oneness had plateaued.

19:25.131 --> 19:26.864
That's why we were having
private sessions.

19:26.933 --> 19:28.933
She struggled...

19:28.935 --> 19:30.867
With not progressing
more quickly.

19:30.904 --> 19:32.937
- I bet you had
some wise words for her.

19:33.873 --> 19:36.006
- No, actually.

19:37.911 --> 19:41.145
When in a moment
like oneness was in,

19:41.280 --> 19:44.548
All a teacher can do
is listen and be supportive.

19:48.154 --> 19:50.087
Pushing only causes more pain.

19:50.089 --> 19:51.755
- Speaking of teaching,

19:51.791 --> 19:55.493
Ah, are you about to start
another breathwork session soon?

19:55.628 --> 19:57.861
- Not for a few hours.
- Oh.

19:59.832 --> 20:01.432
- Well, in that case,

20:01.501 --> 20:04.902
Would you guide me through
a breathwork session?

20:05.705 --> 20:06.871
- Of course.

20:15.782 --> 20:18.115
(suspenseful music)

20:31.464 --> 20:33.030
- It isn't what you think,
detective.

20:34.033 --> 20:35.999
I didn't steal,
or anything.

20:36.035 --> 20:37.668
(murdoch): But you do
know what's happened

20:37.704 --> 20:39.937
To the missing item
from the mantle.

20:43.810 --> 20:47.211
Miss franklin, my duty
is to locate mrs. Ryther.

20:47.346 --> 20:49.680
I've no wish to bring
you any trouble.

20:51.951 --> 20:54.218
- Swear you won't tell
mr. Ryther?

20:55.121 --> 20:57.021
- That depends what you tell me.

20:58.524 --> 20:59.890
- It's a vase...

21:00.593 --> 21:01.958
What's missing.

21:01.995 --> 21:03.261
A very valuable one.

21:04.764 --> 21:06.364
Mrs. Ryther asked me
to bring it down

21:06.366 --> 21:08.499
To crawford's pawn shop
to be sold.

21:08.634 --> 21:10.568
- You've had contact with her?

21:10.703 --> 21:12.770
- A telephone call
the other morning.

21:12.772 --> 21:14.237
I think she waited
until she knew

21:14.274 --> 21:15.773
Mr. Ryther would be at work.

21:17.443 --> 21:19.843
- What happened
to the money from the sale?

21:19.912 --> 21:22.179
- She asked me to leave it
with the clerk;

21:22.248 --> 21:23.914
Said she would pick
the money up herself.

21:25.184 --> 21:26.384
I know how it sounds,
detective,

21:26.519 --> 21:28.719
But it's the truth. I swear!

21:31.590 --> 21:33.057
(birds chirping)

21:35.828 --> 21:37.728
- Did you find anything?
- Possibly.

21:37.863 --> 21:39.263
There's a ledger in the office;

21:39.265 --> 21:42.032
Students are donating
large sums to the society.

21:43.336 --> 21:44.602
- Even alison?

21:44.604 --> 21:46.070
- She gave five hundred dollars.

21:46.773 --> 21:48.339
- That's a lot of money.

21:48.474 --> 21:50.474
- Especially to learn
teachings that are,

21:50.476 --> 21:52.743
When you look closely,
nothing but a mishmash

21:52.779 --> 21:54.545
Of traditions
from other cultures.

21:54.614 --> 21:56.280
- Well, yes. I suspect serigalo

21:56.415 --> 21:59.350
Invented unbosoming
after reading dr. Freud.

21:59.352 --> 22:00.884
- Hm.
- But if you know this,

22:00.920 --> 22:02.152
Why do you still come?

22:03.322 --> 22:05.222
- Serigalo's idea
of the unified self

22:05.291 --> 22:08.258
Is intriguing, regardless of
where his teachings originated.

22:10.229 --> 22:11.561
- Are you still...

22:11.597 --> 22:14.031
Trying to reconcile
your private proclivities

22:14.166 --> 22:15.632
With your work?

22:15.668 --> 22:16.700
- Yes.

22:17.870 --> 22:19.403
- And you think serigalo
can help you with that?

22:19.405 --> 22:22.640
- Ah, I'm willing to give him
the benefit of the doubt.

22:26.379 --> 22:29.680
- Well, maybe not everyone
feels the same way.

22:31.117 --> 22:32.516
- What are you suggesting?

22:32.518 --> 22:35.853
- Well, what if alison
discovered that she'd paid

22:35.988 --> 22:38.122
To learn something
that she could find for free

22:38.124 --> 22:39.256
In the library?

22:39.292 --> 22:41.926
Serigalo might do a lot
to keep that quiet.

22:41.928 --> 22:43.527
- Did you find anything of note

22:43.662 --> 22:45.329
Where alison
was practicing breathwork?

22:45.398 --> 22:46.397
- I did.
- Mm.

22:47.633 --> 22:49.233
Incense.

22:49.302 --> 22:52.136
- What if alison
didn't ingest strychnine,

22:52.205 --> 22:53.404
But inhaled it?

22:53.406 --> 22:55.071
- From the incense, you mean?

22:55.108 --> 22:56.407
Wouldn't she have realized?

22:57.043 --> 22:58.442
- Not necessarily.

22:58.444 --> 23:01.078
Strychnine burns
colourless and odourless.

23:02.348 --> 23:04.081
- We need to find out
where that incense came from,

23:04.216 --> 23:05.849
And I have an idea
where to start.

23:06.552 --> 23:08.752
(breathing rapidly)

23:08.788 --> 23:10.220
- And relax.

23:10.256 --> 23:11.955
(breathing slows)

23:14.394 --> 23:16.827
Wonderful... Work.

23:16.863 --> 23:19.163
(breathing heavily)

23:19.232 --> 23:20.564
How do you feel?

23:21.367 --> 23:23.100
(sobbing)

23:27.340 --> 23:28.705
- I-I feel...

23:28.741 --> 23:30.841
I feel like there's a...

23:30.877 --> 23:33.443
A storm in my heart and--

23:33.479 --> 23:35.245
(sobbing)

23:36.715 --> 23:37.781
I'm sorry.

23:37.850 --> 23:39.583
- It's all right.

23:39.718 --> 23:41.852
(breathing deeply)

23:46.325 --> 23:48.392
I'll give you time to process.

23:49.162 --> 23:50.461
This might help.

23:54.133 --> 23:55.265
Light this...

23:58.438 --> 24:00.070
Practise your contemplation.

24:01.140 --> 24:03.674
And we can speak later.

24:12.685 --> 24:14.618
(effie sighs)

24:14.620 --> 24:16.420
(curious music)

24:38.978 --> 24:40.777
(exhales deeply)

24:42.081 --> 24:44.715
- If serigalo gave alison
the incense that killed her,

24:44.850 --> 24:47.317
There may be remnants
of strychnine in here.

24:47.353 --> 24:49.653
(suspenseful music)

25:00.433 --> 25:01.431
- Llewellyn?

25:04.470 --> 25:06.203
I believe this is strychnine.

25:06.205 --> 25:08.204
- We may have found our killer.

25:08.241 --> 25:09.740
- And he's with effie right now.

25:09.742 --> 25:12.009
(coughing)

25:14.947 --> 25:16.413
- Wh-what? What? Ow!

25:16.482 --> 25:17.614
(coughing)

25:17.650 --> 25:18.615
What's going on?

25:18.684 --> 25:20.417
- Take deep breaths.
We'll explain later.

25:20.419 --> 25:22.286
(effie gasping)
- where's serigalo?

25:22.288 --> 25:24.154
- I don't know. I, he...
(stammers)

25:24.290 --> 25:26.756
(coughs)
he left five minutes ago.

25:26.792 --> 25:28.091
(coughing)

25:28.127 --> 25:29.293
- Just breathe.

25:30.463 --> 25:33.363
(groaning)

25:44.910 --> 25:46.843
- Why would someone attack you?

25:47.479 --> 25:48.479
- I don't know.

25:48.481 --> 25:50.047
- Vengeance is
an obvious motive.

25:50.049 --> 25:53.517
- What? No! I can't be held
responsible for what happened.

25:54.587 --> 25:56.720
Oneness' death
was clearly an accident.

25:56.789 --> 26:00.324
- Uh, no. It was incense
laced with strychnine.

26:00.459 --> 26:01.524
Presume this is yours?

26:01.561 --> 26:03.193
- Yes, but I-I-I share
that with others

26:03.329 --> 26:04.528
Who need extra support.

26:04.663 --> 26:05.729
- Such as oneness?

26:06.432 --> 26:08.865
- Yes. And joy, earlier.

26:10.035 --> 26:11.668
- Why do you think
that I need extra support?

26:12.705 --> 26:15.138
- Your heart and mind
are at war, joy.

26:15.942 --> 26:18.676
You love and yet you despair

26:18.811 --> 26:21.344
And you want to escape
those feelings

26:21.380 --> 26:22.846
By any means necessary,

26:22.848 --> 26:25.249
But I did not know that incense
was laced with anything!

26:25.384 --> 26:27.217
- Please, try to sit back.

26:27.253 --> 26:28.619
- If that's true,

26:28.754 --> 26:31.254
The killer could have been
targeting you all along.

26:32.158 --> 26:34.091
(panting)
- I heard what happened.

26:34.160 --> 26:36.359
We must send everyone away
to protect serigalo.

26:36.395 --> 26:37.494
- I don't think
that's advisable.

26:37.563 --> 26:38.962
If someone's targeting him,

26:38.998 --> 26:40.197
Everyone here is a suspect.

26:40.199 --> 26:41.632
We need to keep them
in our sights.

26:41.634 --> 26:42.766
- My mala, where is it?

26:42.901 --> 26:44.168
- Ah, it was broken
in the attack.

26:44.303 --> 26:45.869
- No.
- Judging by the marks

26:45.938 --> 26:47.837
On your neck,
the attacker may have tried

26:47.873 --> 26:49.039
To strangle you with it.

26:49.075 --> 26:51.575
- I must have the ring
that was strung upon it back.

26:51.644 --> 26:53.043
- I'll try to find it for you.

26:54.313 --> 26:55.779
- And how do you plan
to ferret out the scoundrel

26:55.781 --> 26:57.381
Trying to kill serigalo?

26:57.516 --> 27:00.250
- For starters, I'd like to know
if anyone might have had motive.

27:01.253 --> 27:04.588
- Yes. Our neighbour,
percy delwyn.

27:04.723 --> 27:05.789
He hates us.

27:05.791 --> 27:07.157
- Then I'll speak to him first.

27:07.226 --> 27:08.925
- Wait! I may have more luck.

27:08.995 --> 27:11.028
He drove us in
from the train station.

27:12.164 --> 27:14.198
Here. Apply pressure
until the bleeding stops.

27:14.333 --> 27:15.265
(groans)

27:16.702 --> 27:18.936
- Very well. I'll check alibis
of the other fellowship members.

27:19.071 --> 27:19.803
- Wait!

27:20.873 --> 27:22.572
Setia can do that with joy.

27:23.275 --> 27:24.608
Please, stay here.

27:24.677 --> 27:26.643
I need you to keep me safe.

27:28.180 --> 27:29.680
(tense music)

27:34.153 --> 27:35.819
(knocking)

27:35.821 --> 27:37.554
- Mr. Crawford.
- Detective murdoch.

27:37.556 --> 27:39.756
Can I help you?
- I have a few questions.

27:39.825 --> 27:42.292
I believe a woman came in
a few days ago

27:42.361 --> 27:46.329
Looking to collect some money
for a vase.

27:47.500 --> 27:50.367
Perhaps you recognize her
from this photograph?

27:50.502 --> 27:52.769
- I'm afraid I can't help you.
(chuckles)

27:52.838 --> 27:55.439
One of the chief reasons
for my success

27:55.441 --> 27:58.041
Is the discretion
I show my customers.

27:59.311 --> 28:02.980
- I happen to be familiar
with the owner of said vase

28:02.982 --> 28:05.381
And I suspect that he would
not appreciate

28:05.418 --> 28:06.817
Knowing that you purchased it

28:06.952 --> 28:10.087
Without proper
documentation of ownership.

28:10.856 --> 28:13.256
- Vase? Hm. What vase?

28:13.292 --> 28:14.892
(clears throat)

28:16.762 --> 28:18.729
I don't know anything
about a vase.

28:19.532 --> 28:20.831
(crawford clears throat)

28:20.900 --> 28:22.499
- Mr. Crawford,
I-I just need to know

28:22.634 --> 28:25.102
If you recognize the woman
from the photograph.

28:25.771 --> 28:26.870
(sighs)

28:28.674 --> 28:30.407
- She was in a few days ago.

28:30.409 --> 28:31.775
- How did she seem?

28:32.544 --> 28:34.077
- Fine.

28:34.146 --> 28:36.012
- Not under any duress?

28:36.749 --> 28:38.515
- None that I saw.

28:38.517 --> 28:40.784
She was in a real hurry, though.

28:40.919 --> 28:42.385
- Did she say why?

28:42.421 --> 28:43.787
- Something about a train.

28:43.922 --> 28:46.055
She had to get back
to a social

28:46.092 --> 28:47.691
Something-or-other
in huntsville.

28:51.230 --> 28:54.631
- Might she have used
the word society?

28:54.700 --> 28:58.569
- Yes! That was the exact word!

28:58.704 --> 28:59.970
(laughing)

29:00.105 --> 29:01.705
You should be a detective.

29:03.442 --> 29:05.108
- That's a list
of everyone here.

29:05.177 --> 29:07.110
Should make checking
the alibis easier.

29:07.113 --> 29:08.512
- Thank you.

29:08.514 --> 29:09.980
- Have you found
the teacher's ring?

29:10.049 --> 29:11.915
- No, no sign of it.

29:11.984 --> 29:13.517
- That's a shame.

29:13.586 --> 29:14.985
Well, everyone should've been
doing their chores

29:15.120 --> 29:16.853
When serigalo
was being attacked.

29:20.926 --> 29:22.192
- Sorry to bother you.

29:24.029 --> 29:25.662
- Not at all.

29:25.731 --> 29:27.530
- Thank you, freedom.

29:27.566 --> 29:29.333
You go by calm, is that correct?

29:29.468 --> 29:32.936
- Yes.
- A-and your legal names are...

29:33.005 --> 29:36.740
Your legal names
are nora and david.

29:36.742 --> 29:40.077
Is that right?
- That is. What of it?

29:40.212 --> 29:43.280
- Were you working here
together all afternoon?

29:44.016 --> 29:45.415
- We have been.

29:45.451 --> 29:46.950
- What's with all the questions?

29:48.053 --> 29:49.185
- If you must know,
we're looking into the--

29:49.221 --> 29:51.221
- Joy was just helping me
to confirm

29:51.223 --> 29:53.290
Everyone's set up
with chores.

29:53.359 --> 29:55.392
(curious music)

29:57.630 --> 29:58.762
- There was no need to lie.

29:58.897 --> 30:00.296
- And even less need to worry

30:00.332 --> 30:02.432
Those who are innocent
with the truth.

30:13.179 --> 30:13.977
(gasps)

30:14.112 --> 30:15.345
(grunts)

30:15.381 --> 30:16.680
(gasping)

30:17.583 --> 30:18.715
- What on earth?!

30:18.751 --> 30:21.718
- Apologies. Ah, I didn't
recognize you in that getup.

30:21.854 --> 30:23.320
- That is no excuse.

30:23.322 --> 30:25.722
- Sure it is. I don't let
any of that society lot

30:25.858 --> 30:27.658
Trespass on my property.

30:27.660 --> 30:30.193
It's not my fault you got
indoctrinated so fast.

30:30.229 --> 30:32.095
- I did no such thing.

30:32.097 --> 30:35.531
In actual fact, I'm quite
suspicious of the whole thing,

30:35.568 --> 30:37.200
Especially that serigalo.

30:37.203 --> 30:39.469
- Is he the one that runs around
in his underthings?

30:40.573 --> 30:42.606
- Actually, it's...
Traditional undergarment

30:42.675 --> 30:44.474
But... That's beside the point.

30:44.543 --> 30:46.009
Uh...
(sighs)

30:46.144 --> 30:47.744
You said that you don't
trust the group.

30:47.813 --> 30:49.346
What do you think's
going on over there?

30:49.415 --> 30:51.948
- Ol' underthings
is nice enough, I guess.

30:52.017 --> 30:53.750
It's that lady I don't trust.

30:53.752 --> 30:55.551
- Setia? What has she done?

30:55.588 --> 30:56.953
- She's buying up all the land,

30:56.989 --> 30:59.356
Blocking my access
to my best fishing spots.

30:59.358 --> 31:01.425
She's a bully
and she's a criminal.

31:02.461 --> 31:04.160
- Criminal?
Why would you say that?

31:04.196 --> 31:06.897
- I got proof. I'll show you.

31:14.106 --> 31:15.505
(sighs)
- to know someone

31:15.541 --> 31:16.907
Thinks me a fraud.

31:17.042 --> 31:18.108
It's devastating.

31:19.845 --> 31:23.046
- But perhaps not
entirely wrong?

31:24.750 --> 31:26.316
- What do you mean?

31:26.352 --> 31:28.719
- You're charging students
handsomely to teach them

31:28.854 --> 31:31.788
Little more than adaptations
of ancient practices.

31:31.790 --> 31:33.456
- I know nothing
about the money.

31:33.525 --> 31:34.724
Setia handles all that.

31:34.760 --> 31:35.859
- Hm.

31:36.795 --> 31:38.595
And your teachings?

31:41.199 --> 31:43.333
- If you are familiar with them,
why are you here?

31:44.370 --> 31:46.069
- That's not relevant
at the moment.

31:46.105 --> 31:49.406
- Oh, please. Humour me.

31:51.477 --> 31:52.743
- Very well.

31:52.878 --> 31:53.810
(sighs)

31:55.214 --> 31:57.213
I've been searching for a means

31:57.283 --> 32:01.818
Of unifying the public
and private parts of myself.

32:02.888 --> 32:04.587
Thought you may have
something to offer.

32:05.791 --> 32:08.425
- A unified self does not
necessarily present itself

32:08.427 --> 32:10.494
In its fullness at all times.

32:12.765 --> 32:14.331
- I'm not sure I follow.

32:15.601 --> 32:18.235
- You can be unified within...

32:18.237 --> 32:21.571
Without sharing
that fullness with others.

32:24.310 --> 32:25.976
For example,

32:25.978 --> 32:28.812
I am serigalo, the teacher.

32:30.215 --> 32:35.118
But outside the society,
I am simply steven lukas.

32:35.120 --> 32:36.052
- Ha.

32:37.990 --> 32:39.256
So, you admit
you're a fraud.

32:39.258 --> 32:40.123
- No.

32:40.159 --> 32:41.458
No.

32:41.460 --> 32:43.460
I believe in my teachings.

32:43.462 --> 32:44.995
And I am serigalo,

32:45.064 --> 32:46.196
But it's not my whole self.

32:46.265 --> 32:49.599
It's a persona I adopt to...

32:49.668 --> 32:52.335
Encourage my followers
to believe in my teachings.

32:54.606 --> 32:56.673
- Does that make it
any less a lie?

32:58.277 --> 32:59.743
- If it is a lie,

32:59.745 --> 33:03.046
Then it is a useful lie
for those I serve.

33:05.551 --> 33:06.483
Harmony,

33:08.020 --> 33:10.086
The only thing that matters
is that you know,

33:10.155 --> 33:12.088
And are comfortable with,

33:12.124 --> 33:13.423
Your true self.

33:14.626 --> 33:16.559
That's what frees us

33:16.595 --> 33:18.762
And truly unifies
the heart and mind.

33:20.866 --> 33:22.899
(soft music)

33:33.145 --> 33:34.611
(birds chirping)

33:34.680 --> 33:35.812
(sheep bleating)

33:37.449 --> 33:39.515
- Lovely garden you've got here.

33:39.551 --> 33:41.585
- Oh! Yes, it is.

33:41.720 --> 33:43.319
I can't take credit for it.
I'm just in charge

33:43.355 --> 33:44.720
Of pulling the weeds.

33:44.757 --> 33:47.323
- Have you been working
out here alone all afternoon?

33:47.325 --> 33:50.460
- Yes! My own personal
bit of heaven.

33:51.897 --> 33:54.731
Setia and serigalo
saw what I needed

33:54.733 --> 33:56.666
When I came a few months back.

33:58.203 --> 33:59.803
It's been a balm.

33:59.872 --> 34:02.272
- Your name's joseph, correct?

34:02.274 --> 34:04.741
And you go by
the seeker name peace?

34:04.876 --> 34:05.708
- Yes.

34:07.145 --> 34:09.546
I came seeking it after
the loss of someone close to me.

34:11.617 --> 34:13.016
- Have you found it?

34:13.018 --> 34:13.883
- Hm.

34:15.187 --> 34:16.853
I'm working on it.

34:18.023 --> 34:19.355
You go by joy?

34:20.292 --> 34:21.892
- Yes.

34:21.894 --> 34:24.027
- Have you found the joy
you're looking for here?

34:26.631 --> 34:29.132
- No. I-I think I'm...

34:30.969 --> 34:33.103
Beginning to understand
why that is.

34:36.909 --> 34:37.974
- Where did you get this?

34:38.043 --> 34:39.576
- Percy delwyn,
the man who lives

34:39.711 --> 34:40.977
On the next property over.

34:41.046 --> 34:43.446
Apparently setia
is a confidence woman

34:43.515 --> 34:45.048
By the name of alice shen.

34:46.218 --> 34:47.651
- Says here she was jailed
for several months

34:47.786 --> 34:49.785
After attacking someone
who found her out.

34:49.822 --> 34:51.521
- Do you think this could
be related

34:51.523 --> 34:53.390
To the attempts
on serigalo's life?

34:53.525 --> 34:55.124
- Perhaps he uncovered
her past misdeeds

34:55.160 --> 34:56.192
And wanted her out?

34:56.328 --> 34:58.228
- She does handle
all the financial dealings

34:58.230 --> 35:00.530
For the society,
and judging by the sums

35:00.532 --> 35:02.398
In the ledger,
she had a lot to lose.

35:02.400 --> 35:04.401
- Does she have an alibi
for the time of his attack?

35:04.536 --> 35:05.869
- I didn't even think to ask.

35:05.938 --> 35:07.537
- I think it's time we did.

35:07.573 --> 35:09.038
(gasping)

35:09.074 --> 35:10.507
- Setia! Stop!

35:11.610 --> 35:12.676
- He attacked me!

35:12.678 --> 35:14.511
(panting)
- she's blackmailing me.

35:15.347 --> 35:16.946
- Blackmailing?
- How?

35:16.982 --> 35:18.181
- I'm leaving the society

35:18.217 --> 35:19.916
And she won't give me back
the money that I paid!

35:19.952 --> 35:21.083
- No, those were donations!

35:21.120 --> 35:22.352
- Donations for living expenses

35:22.487 --> 35:23.553
That I no longer require!

35:23.688 --> 35:25.655
- What does this have
to do with blackmail?

35:25.657 --> 35:27.023
(panting)

35:27.025 --> 35:28.825
- She has recordings
of my unbosoming sessions

35:28.960 --> 35:30.893
And she said if I went
to the police about the money,

35:30.929 --> 35:32.562
She's going to give
that to my family.

35:32.697 --> 35:33.763
(panting)

35:33.799 --> 35:34.831
- Is that true?

35:34.966 --> 35:36.499
- Does serigalo know?

35:36.535 --> 35:38.435
- No! He would never.

35:39.771 --> 35:42.305
Please don't tell him.
I beg you.

35:42.307 --> 35:43.907
- You're exploiting someone's
innermost secrets.

35:43.976 --> 35:46.142
You deserve no favours.

35:54.653 --> 35:56.453
- Well, it turns out
that you were right

35:56.588 --> 35:59.088
About serigalo,
and I owe you an apology.

35:59.892 --> 36:01.258
- You were right, too.

36:01.260 --> 36:03.326
About me using this place

36:03.328 --> 36:05.328
As a way to fill
the hole left by george.

36:05.330 --> 36:07.597
- You shouldn't feel
badly about that.

36:07.732 --> 36:10.934
It's a completely understandable
reaction to missing someone.

36:10.936 --> 36:12.669
- I'm just so worried about him.

36:12.804 --> 36:15.738
And angry! He left without
so much as asking me!

36:16.508 --> 36:18.141
- He'll be back before long,

36:18.276 --> 36:19.976
Safe and sound. I'm sure of it.

36:24.282 --> 36:25.315
(murdoch): Julia?

36:26.785 --> 36:27.850
(julia): William?

36:29.121 --> 36:30.386
- Thank you, julia.

36:32.524 --> 36:34.357
- What on earth are you wearing?

36:34.393 --> 36:37.027
- Well, uh, hello to you, too.

36:37.162 --> 36:40.029
The more pertinent question
is what're you doing here?

36:40.098 --> 36:43.900
- Oh! The inspector has me
looking for his friend's wife

36:44.035 --> 36:45.168
That's gone missing.

36:45.303 --> 36:46.603
- You think she might be here?

36:46.605 --> 36:47.904
- I do.

36:49.007 --> 36:50.640
Do you recognize her?

36:50.676 --> 36:52.742
- Oh, that's freedom!

36:52.811 --> 36:54.110
- Freedom, you say?

36:54.179 --> 36:56.379
- Ah, well, it's the name
that she goes by here.

36:56.415 --> 36:57.714
- Ah!

36:59.284 --> 37:00.783
And where might she be?

37:01.653 --> 37:02.752
- Shameful.

37:03.589 --> 37:05.788
Recording unbosoming sessions.

37:05.824 --> 37:06.923
And blackmail.

37:06.992 --> 37:08.191
- So you didn't know?

37:08.326 --> 37:09.593
- Of course not.

37:09.728 --> 37:12.195
- Were you aware of this?

37:15.801 --> 37:16.866
- Yes.

37:18.203 --> 37:20.803
Setia had told me that
she had turned over a new leaf.

37:22.341 --> 37:24.074
Clearly, that's not the case.

37:25.877 --> 37:27.977
May I speak with her?
- Yes.

37:30.949 --> 37:32.214
For all her many faults,

37:32.251 --> 37:34.417
It seems as though
setia isn't our killer.

37:34.552 --> 37:35.685
- How can you be sure?

37:35.721 --> 37:38.021
- She has no motive.
Serigalo knew about her past.

37:38.023 --> 37:40.223
- But the-the blackmail
and the recordings?

37:40.225 --> 37:41.891
- Were both news to him.

37:41.960 --> 37:43.626
She may have attacked calm
to keep her secret,

37:43.695 --> 37:45.695
But she had no reason
to kill serigalo.

37:45.764 --> 37:47.563
- Then who in heaven
is trying to?

37:47.565 --> 37:50.633
- Something tells me those
recordings may give us a clue.

37:52.404 --> 37:55.838
- Strange.
It's already unlocked.

37:55.874 --> 37:58.908
- Good lord! There must be
two dozen recordings in here.

37:59.845 --> 38:01.778
- Blackmailing students.

38:02.781 --> 38:04.381
I can't believe
you'd do such a thing.

38:04.383 --> 38:06.515
- I was trying to protect you.

38:06.551 --> 38:08.184
And the society.

38:08.253 --> 38:10.453
In case we were ever
faced with questions.

38:11.589 --> 38:13.256
- You've been making
them that long.

38:13.258 --> 38:15.591
- Ever since well
began to struggle.

38:15.661 --> 38:17.994
I was worried that something
terrible would happen.

38:18.129 --> 38:19.662
And I was right.

38:20.432 --> 38:22.265
- I'm sorry. Who is well?

38:23.001 --> 38:24.934
- Uh, joey knight,

38:26.038 --> 38:28.338
Former student.

38:28.473 --> 38:30.540
He killed himself
six months ago.

38:31.843 --> 38:34.144
- Those initials, jk,

38:34.146 --> 38:35.812
It was his ring on your mala?

38:37.248 --> 38:40.082
- And his ring that disappeared
when you were attacked.

38:40.118 --> 38:41.617
The two things must be related.

38:41.653 --> 38:42.818
- Perhaps there's something
of interest

38:42.854 --> 38:44.687
On one of well's recordings?

38:44.690 --> 38:46.289
But one of them is missing.

38:46.358 --> 38:47.757
- None were missing earlier.

38:47.793 --> 38:49.892
I checked before
I spoke to calm.

38:49.928 --> 38:52.495
- Which means someone's taken it
in the last hour.

38:53.665 --> 38:55.565
Is anyone currently
at the society

38:55.634 --> 38:56.833
Connected to joey?

38:57.836 --> 38:59.369
- Ah, I don't believe so.
- Hm.

38:59.504 --> 39:01.704
- None of the current students
were here before he died.

39:03.308 --> 39:04.741
- It's peace.

39:04.876 --> 39:05.908
- How do you know?

39:05.944 --> 39:07.777
- His legal name,
it's joseph.

39:07.813 --> 39:09.979
- He did arrive shortly
after joey died.

39:10.115 --> 39:12.448
- And he told me that he came
here seeking peace

39:12.484 --> 39:14.183
After the loss
of someone close to him.

39:14.219 --> 39:15.852
- I've an idea
where to find him.

39:18.323 --> 39:20.723
<i> (joey on recording):</i>
<i>I try to let go of bad thoughts,</i>

39:20.726 --> 39:23.259
<i> But they just</i>
<i> come back stronger.</i>

39:23.328 --> 39:24.928
<i> It's as though</i>
<i> there's a monster...</i>

39:24.930 --> 39:25.795
- Peace.
<i> - ...Inside of me</i>

39:25.930 --> 39:27.263
<i> Telling me I'm worthless.</i>

39:27.265 --> 39:28.398
(recording stops)

39:29.801 --> 39:31.067
- Joseph.

39:31.069 --> 39:32.802
(sighs)

39:37.642 --> 39:38.708
(sniffles)

39:38.710 --> 39:41.010
- I never meant to hurt oneness.

39:41.012 --> 39:42.077
- I know.

39:42.114 --> 39:44.313
The incense was intended
for serigalo,

39:44.349 --> 39:46.950
But when that failed,
you tried a more direct attack.

39:49.388 --> 39:52.822
- He pushed my son
to take his own life.

39:53.725 --> 39:55.925
He deserves to be punished.

39:57.362 --> 39:58.394
- Maybe.

39:59.731 --> 40:01.130
But not by you.

40:01.833 --> 40:03.233
(sniffles)

40:05.170 --> 40:06.602
- I know I'm going to jail,

40:08.506 --> 40:09.639
But please...

40:11.376 --> 40:12.776
Just give me...

40:12.911 --> 40:15.445
(sniffles)
...One more minute...

40:15.447 --> 40:17.246
To hear my joey's voice.

40:18.683 --> 40:23.987
This was recorded
just a few days before... He...

40:24.122 --> 40:25.522
(recording plays)

40:25.524 --> 40:27.656
<i> (serigalo on recordig):</i>
<i> You're not trying hard enough,</i>

40:27.692 --> 40:29.992
<i> Joey. If you wanted to be</i>
<i> free of these thoughts,</i>

40:30.028 --> 40:31.060
<i> You would be!</i>

40:31.096 --> 40:32.262
<i> (joey): I don't</i>
<i> know what to do!</i>

40:32.397 --> 40:33.997
- I am...
<i> (joey): Please.</i>

40:33.999 --> 40:36.732
<i> Help me, serigalo.</i>
- So terribly sorry, peace.

40:36.802 --> 40:40.136
- I won't have peace until
you pay for my son's death.

40:40.939 --> 40:42.572
- Hey, hey. Hey, hey.

40:42.707 --> 40:44.474
(sobbing)

41:04.796 --> 41:06.829
- You came all
this way to find me?

41:06.865 --> 41:08.298
- At your husband's request.

41:09.434 --> 41:11.301
- Nathaniel does nothing
for six weeks,

41:11.436 --> 41:14.037
But the minute I touch
the household accounts...

41:15.440 --> 41:18.041
- Why didn't you tell
your husband where you were?

41:18.176 --> 41:20.476
- If I told him,

41:20.512 --> 41:22.345
He would probably
have had me committed.

41:23.849 --> 41:25.648
- So you wish to stay?

41:25.684 --> 41:27.016
- I do.

41:27.085 --> 41:30.052
I finally know
what it is to be at peace.

41:31.256 --> 41:32.788
I'd like to keep it that way,

41:32.824 --> 41:34.290
If you'll keep my secret.

41:37.262 --> 41:39.595
- Seems you're losing
some students.

41:39.631 --> 41:40.997
- Well, even if only
one remains,

41:40.999 --> 41:42.932
That's reason enough
to carry on

41:43.001 --> 41:44.466
The work of the society.

41:44.503 --> 41:46.069
- You plan to stay on?

41:46.071 --> 41:47.469
- Of course.

41:47.506 --> 41:49.872
And I hope to see you both
back sometime soon.

41:51.609 --> 41:55.144
- Oh, I-I think it's time
that I...

41:55.280 --> 41:57.947
Return to being just...

41:57.949 --> 41:59.081
Effie.

41:59.117 --> 42:01.350
- But you're still
so conflicted. I can see it.

42:02.153 --> 42:04.286
- I am, but...

42:04.322 --> 42:06.422
I think it's time
that I learned to face

42:06.424 --> 42:11.227
The despair I'm feeling rather
than chase some impossible joy.

42:13.198 --> 42:14.831
- That is so brave.

42:15.500 --> 42:16.699
- Thank you.

42:16.834 --> 42:17.967
- And harmony...

42:19.170 --> 42:21.304
Will I see you again?

42:21.373 --> 42:23.305
- Oh...

42:23.341 --> 42:24.506
I don't think so.

42:24.543 --> 42:27.110
Though I am grateful
for what you've taught me.

42:28.513 --> 42:30.246
I used to believe I was lying

42:30.381 --> 42:32.247
If I wasn't bringing
my full self

42:32.284 --> 42:34.417
To my job
and my public life.

42:35.086 --> 42:36.085
- And now?

42:37.088 --> 42:39.121
- Well, our conversation earlier

42:39.157 --> 42:42.058
Made me realize some separation

42:42.060 --> 42:45.595
Between my public
and private selves

42:45.597 --> 42:47.730
May be a benefit...

42:47.732 --> 42:49.599
To all parts of my life.

42:52.003 --> 42:53.603
- That is wonderful to hear.

42:55.974 --> 42:57.206
(door closes)

42:57.208 --> 42:59.274
(julia): Is that you, william?

42:59.311 --> 43:01.077
- It is indeed.

43:01.212 --> 43:03.278
- How did it go
with the inspector?

43:03.315 --> 43:04.947
- Oh, I don't think he actually

43:04.950 --> 43:07.450
Believes that I haven't
found eleanor yet.

43:08.219 --> 43:09.552
Oh!

43:09.687 --> 43:11.421
Am I interrupting something?

43:11.556 --> 43:13.422
(julia chuckles)

43:13.491 --> 43:14.557
- Not at all.

43:14.559 --> 43:16.358
I'm just practicing
the stretches

43:16.394 --> 43:18.561
I learned at the society.
