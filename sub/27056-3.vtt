WEBVTT

00:11.594 --> 00:13.847
If zero here,

00:14.431 --> 00:15.932
our calculations give us

00:16.015 --> 00:19.978
two tilt shifts in T1 and T2

00:20.562 --> 00:22.272
with a variable position vector.

00:22.355 --> 00:24.941
But if you resolve these,

00:25.025 --> 00:28.027
you're still missing 0.3 degrees.

00:30.113 --> 00:31.740
The object changed direction.

00:32.449 --> 00:33.283
On its own.

00:35.952 --> 00:37.454
Thank you, Karl.

00:38.705 --> 00:39.789
It's a thrilling idea.

00:40.290 --> 00:41.624
Thrilling.

00:43.960 --> 00:46.713
I will just point out
that these deviancies

00:46.796 --> 00:49.924
all reside within the range
of optical aberration.

00:51.009 --> 00:52.886
Thank you, Nelson. I did think of that.

00:53.386 --> 00:55.346
And if you look, you will see

00:55.847 --> 00:58.767
we identified shifts here and here,

00:59.434 --> 01:00.977
and adjustments in speed and direction.

01:01.061 --> 01:04.522
No celestial object
changes course like that

01:05.231 --> 01:06.107
on its own.

01:07.734 --> 01:09.027
-Ever.

01:10.320 --> 01:13.406
Next, you'll be telling us
it's piloted by intelligent life.

01:15.658 --> 01:16.576
I believe that.

01:17.577 --> 01:18.495
Yes.

01:22.916 --> 01:23.875
What if I'm right?

01:24.542 --> 01:25.376
Hm?

01:25.794 --> 01:27.378
We're running out of time on this planet.

01:27.462 --> 01:30.757
Colonization is not happening fast enough.
If we can make contact with them...

01:30.840 --> 01:32.926
What if they have
the ability to save all of us.?

01:33.426 --> 01:35.678
All right. Well, you've given us
a lot to consider.

01:37.222 --> 01:40.266
And look at it this way,
if your theories don't pan out,

01:40.350 --> 01:41.518
you can always write a book.

01:41.601 --> 01:42.685
Hm?

01:46.147 --> 01:46.981
Professor?

01:48.775 --> 01:50.109
You have a call on the feed.

01:50.860 --> 01:51.694
Thank you.

01:53.947 --> 01:55.115
Good afternoon, Professor.

01:55.198 --> 01:56.574
Do you know who I am?

01:56.658 --> 01:57.492
Yes.

01:58.201 --> 01:59.119
Mr. Eris.

01:59.744 --> 02:00.912
How did your presentation go?

02:01.913 --> 02:04.040
I suspect Dr. Nelson was left unconvinced?

02:04.124 --> 02:05.250
Well, I mean...

02:05.333 --> 02:06.626
maybe my math was off.

02:07.293 --> 02:09.587
No, your calculations are correct.

02:10.588 --> 02:13.216
Wait, I haven't published any data.
How could you verify my numbers?

02:13.299 --> 02:14.300
It doesn't matter.

02:15.510 --> 02:16.511
What does...

02:18.513 --> 02:22.267
is that we share a mutual desire
to make contact with that vessel.

02:27.272 --> 02:28.857
I have a proposal for you.

02:41.035 --> 02:42.662
Were you ever straight with me?

02:48.877 --> 02:50.086
The body is a shell.

02:54.966 --> 02:57.677
A vessel within which we carry our spirit.

03:00.597 --> 03:02.223
When that vessel shatters,

03:04.392 --> 03:05.768
our life continues,

03:06.477 --> 03:08.813
released from the constraints
of the terrestrial life,

03:08.897 --> 03:11.399
free to explore the vastness
of the heavens.

03:12.692 --> 03:15.528
A return to the stars
from which our life first sprang.

03:17.196 --> 03:18.072
Thank you, sir.

03:19.908 --> 03:20.867
Very well said.

03:30.793 --> 03:31.669
Karl.

03:40.011 --> 03:41.638
I know you launched your probe.

03:43.306 --> 03:45.099
My tech picks up on the data trail.

03:45.183 --> 03:46.768
Well, if I'm in charge
of the science team,

03:46.851 --> 03:48.561
I need to be able to make those calls.

03:49.562 --> 03:50.521
You don't trust me?

03:51.814 --> 03:54.400
I lied to preserve the life of your L-1.

03:54.484 --> 03:56.653
At the very least, you owe me respect!

03:58.821 --> 04:00.823
Cargo decompression
and release

04:00.907 --> 04:04.077
in three, two, one.

05:21.654 --> 05:22.739
What?

05:24.198 --> 05:25.158
What's wrong?

05:28.995 --> 05:29.996
Nothing.

05:31.956 --> 05:32.915
It's just...

05:35.960 --> 05:37.128
you make me happy.

05:41.549 --> 05:43.217
Come on, you.

05:43.301 --> 05:45.470
You've had other partners, right?

05:47.472 --> 05:50.099
I grew up in a Luddite commune.

05:50.892 --> 05:52.435
So sexing was forbidden.

05:53.394 --> 05:56.314
So was tech and a lot of other stuff.

05:56.397 --> 05:57.231
Oh.

05:58.566 --> 05:59.609
So...

06:00.735 --> 06:02.487
-I'm your...
-No, I had.

06:02.570 --> 06:03.404
Um...

06:05.656 --> 06:06.783
It was nothing like this.

06:08.326 --> 06:09.327
Well...

06:10.620 --> 06:12.830
sexing is great for your biochemistry.

06:14.415 --> 06:16.876
You just have to be careful

06:17.794 --> 06:21.339
not to get caught up in all the bullshit
that comes along with it.

06:22.048 --> 06:23.091
You mean...

06:24.425 --> 06:26.344
-feelings?

06:35.103 --> 06:36.395
We're off-cycle, boss.

06:36.479 --> 06:38.231
Not anymore. I need to speak with you.

06:38.648 --> 06:40.525
About your boss. About Eris.

06:42.026 --> 06:43.027
He said something to me.

06:43.778 --> 06:45.613
I can't quite shake it about.

06:45.696 --> 06:47.615
Not being in control of the ship.

06:47.698 --> 06:50.868
Seems like everything he does
is to remind us that he is in control.

06:50.952 --> 06:52.870
You mean the system malfunctions?

06:52.954 --> 06:54.872
What, you think that's
what he's talking about?

06:54.956 --> 06:56.165
No. He wouldn't say.

06:56.249 --> 06:58.918
But he has a problem
and he's trying to hide it from us.

07:00.378 --> 07:02.213
We could help him if he'll let us.

07:02.296 --> 07:03.756
No, he won't. He won't.

07:04.674 --> 07:09.220
Lommie, can you set a trace to track
the origin of any future malfunctions?

07:09.303 --> 07:10.221
Uh...

07:10.596 --> 07:12.140
Yeah, I guess. It's just...

07:12.223 --> 07:13.432
What exactly are we looking for?

07:13.516 --> 07:15.268
Maybe I should talk to him.

07:15.351 --> 07:16.561
He might be more open with me.

07:17.270 --> 07:18.479
Why would he be?

07:18.896 --> 07:20.064
He tells me things.

07:22.191 --> 07:23.234
Since when?

07:23.317 --> 07:25.570
He's been watching me
since I came on board.

07:27.196 --> 07:28.322
He's curious.

07:29.699 --> 07:30.658
Sure.

07:30.741 --> 07:32.326
One of you, do it to get inside his head.

07:55.266 --> 07:57.101
Dangerous work we do out here.

07:58.352 --> 07:59.479
Sorry, sir?

08:01.355 --> 08:02.398
Brandy and Port.

08:03.399 --> 08:04.442
It will help you sleep.

08:11.282 --> 08:12.492
-Don't worry.

08:15.328 --> 08:17.747
It's just the ionic particles
at the edge of the heliosphere.

08:18.247 --> 08:20.124
Making the ship sing.

08:26.380 --> 08:27.632
We shouldn't be out here.

08:29.800 --> 08:31.052
The ship is fine.

08:32.428 --> 08:34.889
Some members of the crew
are starting to show weakness.

08:36.974 --> 08:38.935
Take a couple of cycles off,
Mr. Suczek.

08:39.727 --> 08:41.938
I need you ready for duty
by the end of the week.

08:44.315 --> 08:45.608
Yes, sir.

09:04.710 --> 09:07.213
You really do take liberties
on the ship, don't you?

09:08.047 --> 09:10.758
Stop staring at me with that eye
and come talk to me.

09:13.344 --> 09:14.554
What's wrong, Melantha?

09:16.681 --> 09:18.766
Honestly, I'm tired of the hypocrisy.

09:19.600 --> 09:21.477
All this talk about truth-seeking,

09:21.561 --> 09:23.062
but everything about you feels like a lie.

09:23.145 --> 09:26.399
The only lie I told
was to protect Karl and his telepath.

09:26.482 --> 09:28.442
See, I think that was your strategy.

09:29.068 --> 09:31.654
I think you got problems on the ship
that you can't handle,

09:31.737 --> 09:34.156
and the only reason you helped us
was to get us off your back.

09:34.240 --> 09:35.533
Is that really what you think of me?

09:35.616 --> 09:37.910
I don't know what to think of you
because you're not here.

09:38.411 --> 09:40.329
Why don't you ever come to me
in person?

09:45.418 --> 09:46.794
You watch me all the time,

09:46.877 --> 09:48.045
and you give nothing back.

09:48.129 --> 09:50.089
Do you trust me, Melantha?

09:55.928 --> 09:58.598
Whatever it is
that you're hiding, Roy,

09:59.557 --> 10:01.601
you don't have to carry that burden alone.

10:05.771 --> 10:06.856
Let me help you.

10:16.741 --> 10:18.367
You must be the bee lady.

10:19.827 --> 10:22.121
And you're the genius
xenobiologist.

10:23.539 --> 10:25.249
I've seen you on the news feeds.

10:28.127 --> 10:29.170
You mind if I...

10:30.421 --> 10:33.007
Sometimes I just need to be around plants.

10:33.090 --> 10:36.636
We all need a little piece of nature
in order to stay sane.

10:37.386 --> 10:38.512
Hm.

10:39.221 --> 10:40.806
True nature...

10:42.516 --> 10:43.934
is chaos.

10:44.769 --> 10:48.522
I think if you look closely enough,
you'll find order below the chaos.

10:49.565 --> 10:51.692
I was curious as to your...

10:53.069 --> 10:54.695
encounter with the L-1.

10:56.238 --> 10:57.114
You mean, Thale?

10:57.615 --> 10:59.867
Oh, first name basis.

11:01.327 --> 11:03.621
He's a dangerous creature,
by all accounts.

11:03.704 --> 11:05.706
Well, humans are dangerous creatures.

11:08.042 --> 11:09.752
But you weren't afraid of him.

11:10.711 --> 11:12.755
Thale simply reflects what he takes in.

11:13.714 --> 11:17.676
If everyone stopped projecting
so much darkness and hate,

11:18.177 --> 11:19.762
he might not be a threat at all.

11:20.346 --> 11:21.514
Perhaps, if he...

11:22.932 --> 11:25.601
refined his capabilities.

11:26.811 --> 11:29.438
Might be a useful tool to help others.

11:30.356 --> 11:31.857
You want to experiment on him?

11:33.192 --> 11:34.026
With him.

11:35.069 --> 11:36.320
Why couldn't he sense you?

11:38.197 --> 11:40.991
Well, the collective voice of my bees
was too strong.

11:41.826 --> 11:43.828
I'm guessing he had trouble
filtering through.

11:45.830 --> 11:46.664
Hm.

11:47.706 --> 11:49.875
I love the positive energy, I do.

11:49.959 --> 11:53.087
But handling an L-1
is a little more complicated

11:53.170 --> 11:54.797
than just meditating on smiley faces.

11:54.880 --> 11:56.257
Yeah, I know. I do.

11:56.340 --> 11:58.843
And that is why I want to engage him,

11:58.926 --> 11:59.969
in a real way.

12:02.972 --> 12:04.890
Thale is part of this mission.

12:06.350 --> 12:09.895
Yet they still keep him locked up
in so much reconfinement.

12:13.357 --> 12:14.442
Fine.

12:14.942 --> 12:15.943
No.

12:16.527 --> 12:19.822
If you're going to do this,
there's some rules you have to know first.

12:22.158 --> 12:23.451
Don't get too close.

12:25.077 --> 12:27.788
He may try to taunt you but stay calm.

12:28.581 --> 12:29.748
It's his way of testing.

12:31.584 --> 12:34.837
If you want to keep him out of your mind,
keep it clear.

12:36.046 --> 12:37.173
Whatever you do,

12:37.882 --> 12:39.008
don't show fear.

12:41.177 --> 12:43.012
It'll only make him
more dangerous.

13:13.751 --> 13:14.960
Hello?

13:19.840 --> 13:20.716
Thale?

13:40.402 --> 13:42.029
Next time, ask first.

13:42.112 --> 13:46.075
Yup. Yup, definitely.
Definitely, I will do that.

13:46.742 --> 13:47.785
What do you want?

13:49.370 --> 13:50.663
Just a new friend.

13:51.330 --> 13:52.665
Come to say hello.

13:53.249 --> 13:55.459
Don't fuck me
about Romeo and friends,

13:55.543 --> 13:56.794
you're shitting yourself.

13:56.877 --> 13:58.087
Oh, yes.

13:58.170 --> 14:00.506
You make people's eyes bleed.

14:04.552 --> 14:05.719
Want to see how it works?

14:07.429 --> 14:08.597
Wouldn't hurt...

14:09.223 --> 14:11.600
someone bearing gifts?

14:14.979 --> 14:15.938
Would you?

14:17.773 --> 14:19.024
I can feel something.

14:22.486 --> 14:23.404
What is it?

14:24.113 --> 14:25.739
What

14:31.370 --> 14:32.204
No.

15:42.566 --> 15:44.068
Hello, Suczek.

15:48.155 --> 15:49.740
You left me.

15:54.244 --> 15:56.246
You left me, brother.

15:56.330 --> 15:57.831
You left me.

16:23.065 --> 16:24.942
And do you trust Eris?

16:25.025 --> 16:28.362
I'm trying to. Mal and Lommie
are trying to find out what they can.

16:28.445 --> 16:29.947
There's something wrong with the ship.

16:30.572 --> 16:31.699
He admitted as much.

16:32.241 --> 16:33.784
I just need to figure out what it is.

16:34.451 --> 16:35.411
Do something.

16:38.288 --> 16:39.498
You got the probe off.

16:40.582 --> 16:41.542
That's something.

16:45.879 --> 16:47.089
I miss that sound.

16:47.631 --> 16:48.632
The rain.

16:50.801 --> 16:52.219
I wish I was there with you.

16:56.056 --> 16:57.850
Remember our trip to Yosemite?

16:58.851 --> 16:59.893
Which one?

17:00.686 --> 17:02.771
The bear attack.

17:02.938 --> 17:04.314
Oh, the deadly bear attack.

17:06.275 --> 17:09.069
I've never seen a naked man run so fast.

17:09.570 --> 17:11.321
Hey. I had my underwear on.

17:11.405 --> 17:12.906
Screaming like a madman.

17:14.199 --> 17:15.993
And I was chasing off a killer bear,

17:16.076 --> 17:17.411
I didn't know it was a deer.

17:17.494 --> 17:19.580
A baby deer.

17:24.668 --> 17:25.878
I've, um...

17:27.963 --> 17:30.299
I've uplinked those images for you.

17:32.259 --> 17:33.093
I...

17:33.594 --> 17:35.012
I wanted you to have them...

17:37.347 --> 17:39.558
before I release the memories.

17:40.434 --> 17:41.518
Yosemite?

17:43.228 --> 17:44.104
Yeah.

17:45.147 --> 17:48.776
Uh, Dr. Salzman has been encouraging me
to go deeper.

17:50.486 --> 17:53.572
Anything that...
that could possibly remind me of...

17:55.908 --> 17:56.742
of her.

17:57.117 --> 17:59.703
Joy. That's our honeymoon, Joy.

18:00.954 --> 18:02.915
Those are memories of us.

18:03.707 --> 18:04.792
I know, baby.

18:07.419 --> 18:08.921
I know, but...

18:10.506 --> 18:12.591
we talked about
starting a family, remember?

18:17.679 --> 18:19.431
This is how the therapy works.

18:21.308 --> 18:22.392
I understand.

18:23.977 --> 18:25.145
I want you to be happy.

18:27.898 --> 18:29.233
So, watch the rabbit.

18:30.776 --> 18:32.236
Try and focus...

18:34.196 --> 18:35.948
on the bunny.

18:40.536 --> 18:42.037
What... what's that?

18:42.663 --> 18:43.789
Oh, it's the bee lady.

18:45.249 --> 18:47.209
You can't stop
thinking about her, can you?

18:47.793 --> 18:49.628
Please try and take this seriously.

18:51.046 --> 18:54.883
If we make contact, Karl's relying on you
to communicate with the Volcryn.

18:56.426 --> 18:59.054
Besides, you could clearly use
some practice.

18:59.138 --> 19:01.348
I mean, fuck, man. It's a rabbit.
What do you want me to do?

19:04.393 --> 19:05.602
Tell me about your...

19:06.603 --> 19:08.397
conversation with the bees.

19:08.480 --> 19:10.649
They're insects, mate.
They don't converse.

19:11.358 --> 19:12.860
But you heard the voices.

19:13.235 --> 19:14.695
Well, I heard a voice.

19:14.778 --> 19:16.029
They all spoke as one...

19:17.156 --> 19:18.240
thing.

19:19.408 --> 19:22.619
And besides, there were thousands of them,
so it's pretty fucking loud.

19:24.955 --> 19:26.123
-So...

19:26.582 --> 19:28.125
try that with Ralphy.

19:33.380 --> 19:34.381
All right.

19:35.257 --> 19:36.967
If it's all too hard,

19:38.886 --> 19:40.512
Ralphy and I will go.

19:44.892 --> 19:46.894
I didn't say it was too hard.

20:05.412 --> 20:06.413
Ralphy, is it?

20:07.915 --> 20:09.458
We'll stay the fucking night, mate.

20:35.442 --> 20:37.069
Eris is like a brick wall.

20:37.653 --> 20:39.696
I can't get through to that guy.

20:40.697 --> 20:42.491
I thought you said he was curious.

20:42.574 --> 20:43.617
To be honest,

20:44.910 --> 20:46.286
I think he's scared.

20:47.246 --> 20:49.539
That doesn't exactly instill me
with confidence.

20:50.290 --> 20:52.084
D'Branin, I have something.

20:52.167 --> 20:54.002
Yeah, Thruster 4 keeps overheating,

20:54.086 --> 20:56.213
which triggers
an automatic shutdown and reset.

20:58.298 --> 20:59.841
How often is that happening?

21:00.467 --> 21:01.969
Hundreds of times a day.

21:02.052 --> 21:04.930
The resets are small enough
not to trigger any formal warnings,

21:05.013 --> 21:07.224
but if it happens
over the course of months...

21:07.307 --> 21:08.892
We're going to miss the Volcryn.

21:08.976 --> 21:10.811
Run the times again. Not as a list.

21:10.936 --> 21:13.230
I need to see the period
between each shutdown.

21:14.022 --> 21:15.399
Shutdowns aren't random.

21:16.275 --> 21:17.734
They're part of a pattern.

21:17.818 --> 21:20.028
Yes. Intentional.
Most likely a software program.

21:20.112 --> 21:21.738
I need you to find the origin of the code.

21:22.489 --> 21:23.824
How could you know that?

21:23.907 --> 21:26.493
The deviancies in patterns
indicate an intelligence or agenda.

21:26.576 --> 21:27.869
So, I found the Volcryn.

21:28.870 --> 21:29.871
It...

21:29.955 --> 21:31.623
it's self-deleting.

21:35.752 --> 21:36.795
Shit!

21:39.256 --> 21:40.674
Who is doing this?

21:45.137 --> 21:46.888
I couldn't find
the source of origin.

21:46.972 --> 21:49.391
At least, let's find out
where the instruction came from.

21:51.560 --> 21:52.561
Deck 7.

21:53.270 --> 21:54.771
Eris's quarters.

21:55.230 --> 21:57.149
Captain Eris, we have a problem.

21:58.233 --> 21:59.192
What is it, Karl?

21:59.735 --> 22:01.320
Well, Thruster 4 keeps shutting down.

22:02.321 --> 22:03.905
Yes, I'm aware of the issue.

22:03.989 --> 22:06.158
Then you're aware
that these incremental malfunctions

22:06.241 --> 22:07.451
are pulling us off course?

22:07.534 --> 22:10.912
My Nav Team has been calculating
daily course corrections. Thank you.

22:10.996 --> 22:12.247
Now, If you don't mind.

22:13.457 --> 22:14.583
Is it connected?

22:15.208 --> 22:17.002
What you told me before,
about there being something

22:17.085 --> 22:18.378
in the ship trying to stop us.

22:18.462 --> 22:20.464
-You're out of line, Karl.
-No, I must help you.

22:20.547 --> 22:23.008
Because we cannot afford
to fall behind our intercept. We can't!

22:23.091 --> 22:25.427
Do I have to remind you,
you're a passenger on my vessel.

22:30.557 --> 22:31.725
Standard protocol

22:31.808 --> 22:34.603
would be to shut down Thruster 4
and reset it.

22:34.686 --> 22:37.105
We can't do that safely
until we clear the heliosphere.

22:37.814 --> 22:40.150
So, why not send somebody down
to do that manually?

22:40.233 --> 22:41.109
It's too dangerous.

22:41.193 --> 22:43.528
The radiation would kill anyone
in less than a minute.

22:45.447 --> 22:46.490
No, not anyone.

22:47.449 --> 22:48.784
There is somebody.

22:53.663 --> 22:55.040
You said you wanted to help.

22:55.874 --> 22:56.833
By talking to him.

22:56.917 --> 22:58.960
-Not by walking into a cloud of radiation.
-I know, I know.

22:59.044 --> 23:00.754
But we need this.

23:03.256 --> 23:04.174
Will you do it?

23:06.718 --> 23:08.178
Of course, I'll do it.

23:08.261 --> 23:09.221
Thank you.

23:10.931 --> 23:11.932
There's something else.

23:13.350 --> 23:14.893
I need you to bring Eris with you.

23:38.542 --> 23:39.626
This is bollocks.

23:40.544 --> 23:41.628
What?

23:42.546 --> 23:44.923
What I'm getting
don't feel like rabbity thoughts.

23:46.508 --> 23:48.260
What's it feel?

23:48.343 --> 23:50.011
Stop.

23:51.346 --> 23:52.264
Thale!

23:54.057 --> 23:55.392
What the hell was that?

23:55.976 --> 23:57.894
Thought those look like
rabbit thoughts to you.

23:57.978 --> 23:59.646
I think it's time
you two take a break.

24:00.397 --> 24:02.065
No, no. No, I'm fine.

24:04.526 --> 24:05.652
I asked for that.

24:06.153 --> 24:09.072
Is that what you're, uh,
getting from Ralphy, is it?

24:09.990 --> 24:14.161
Well, get the occasional rabbity
hip-hopping about,

24:14.244 --> 24:15.662
you know, chewing vegetables.

24:15.745 --> 24:18.707
But, yeah, for the most part,
you're a little monster.

24:18.790 --> 24:19.875
Rowan.

24:20.917 --> 24:22.002
I need you.

24:24.337 --> 24:25.797
Take care of Ralphy.

24:25.881 --> 24:26.840
Hm.

24:28.508 --> 24:30.010
How is it coming with Thale?

24:30.093 --> 24:32.554
Well, he's good when he focuses.

24:32.637 --> 24:35.223
And by focuses,
I mean on the experiment, not on me.

24:35.307 --> 24:36.308
What are we doing?

24:36.391 --> 24:37.934
Just keep moving.

24:38.018 --> 24:40.687
Is this your way of telling me
that I need to exercise?

24:40.770 --> 24:44.399
Because my body actually functions
better the way it is.

24:44.482 --> 24:46.526
Where the bloody hell are we going?

24:51.531 --> 24:52.657
Deck 7.

24:53.116 --> 24:54.618
-Captain's quarters?
-Yeah.

24:54.701 --> 24:58.038
I want to talk to Eris. The real Eris.
Not some digital projection.

24:58.580 --> 24:59.748
We're breaking and entering?

25:00.749 --> 25:05.170
Oh. It's not like he cares
about everybody else's privacy, is it?

25:05.253 --> 25:06.713
According to Lommie,

25:06.796 --> 25:09.841
the older parts of the ship
were outfitted with biometric scanners.

25:11.051 --> 25:13.595
What -Yeah.

25:15.347 --> 25:16.556
That will be easy to find.

25:16.640 --> 25:18.099
It is if you know where to look.

25:18.183 --> 25:19.017
Come on!

25:21.645 --> 25:22.896
So what's the plan?

25:22.979 --> 25:26.483
While Eris is busy
helping Mel reset Thruster 4,

25:26.566 --> 25:27.776
we enter his quarters.

25:27.859 --> 25:31.279
Wait. We have no idea
what's behind his bloody door.

25:31.363 --> 25:32.697
No. None.

25:34.199 --> 25:36.117
You know, for a man of science,

25:36.201 --> 25:39.996
you really don't seem to have
a basic grasp of logic and reasoning.

25:40.080 --> 25:41.248
I don't need reasoning.

25:42.249 --> 25:43.250
I've got instincts.

25:44.084 --> 25:45.710
Oh, you've got to be shitting me.

25:46.586 --> 25:47.754
You're a biologist.

25:48.296 --> 25:49.214
You live with this.

25:59.516 --> 26:00.600
Ah, there we go.

26:01.810 --> 26:03.895
Are you sure you're getting this
from the rabbit?

26:04.479 --> 26:07.482
I don't tell Ralphy what to do,
but it's always the same.

26:08.858 --> 26:10.902
Hunger being the overriding theme.

26:12.153 --> 26:14.114
I haven't seen him eat a thing for ages.

26:17.784 --> 26:19.077
Well, he's eating now.

26:21.997 --> 26:22.998
I can feel it.

26:27.794 --> 26:29.754
I almost feel bad for the little sod.

26:31.589 --> 26:32.465
We're the same.

26:32.549 --> 26:36.261
Both just pieces of meat
to be poked and studied.

26:37.262 --> 26:38.847
That's not how I feel about you.

26:39.556 --> 26:40.974
How do you feel about me?

26:42.600 --> 26:43.560
I'm proud of you.

26:44.728 --> 26:46.730
It's not the answer I was looking for.

26:46.813 --> 26:48.315
You're off suppression.

26:48.398 --> 26:50.942
You're having meaningful interactions
with people.

26:52.485 --> 26:54.404
I can't wait to get home
and show them all.

27:00.410 --> 27:01.828
We aren't going home.

27:03.413 --> 27:05.040
Not me, not you.

27:05.874 --> 27:07.167
Not Ralphy.

27:09.586 --> 27:11.254
We're all going to die up here.

27:51.294 --> 27:53.505
I think we shouldn't really be doing this.

27:54.297 --> 27:55.757
We are scientists.

27:55.840 --> 27:57.509
Oh, you can leave if you want,

27:58.134 --> 27:59.344
but I need to meet Eris.

28:01.346 --> 28:05.975
But, by pouring human waste
onto a scanner that's over 40 years old?

28:08.645 --> 28:10.105
That answers one question.

28:12.315 --> 28:17.612
But doesn't change the fact that
this is a wonderfully ill-advised idea.

28:20.240 --> 28:21.574
Hey, it wasn't me.

28:22.409 --> 28:24.369
Rowan did this.
He knew it was going to die.

28:24.452 --> 28:26.162
No. He wouldn't have done it arbitrarily.

28:26.663 --> 28:28.706
-There had to a purpose.
-Purpose?

28:28.790 --> 28:30.667
Like every other experiment
I've been involved in,

28:30.750 --> 28:32.252
the purpose is to torture the L-1.

28:37.340 --> 28:38.842
I can still hear his voice.

28:38.925 --> 28:39.759
Who?

28:40.927 --> 28:41.886
Ralphy?

28:42.387 --> 28:44.472
He's hungrier than ever. I can feel him...

28:45.974 --> 28:46.975
chewing.

28:58.194 --> 28:59.654
What are you doing?

29:09.831 --> 29:10.874
Hello, Ralphy.

29:10.957 --> 29:12.250
A bloody tapeworm.

29:17.088 --> 29:18.381
That wasn't the rabbit.

29:20.133 --> 29:22.927
Rowan wanted me to find
the voice inside the rabbit.

29:26.431 --> 29:27.390
Fucker.

29:40.111 --> 29:43.364
My hemoglobin has a synthetic receptor
that binds to iodine.

29:44.157 --> 29:45.450
The half-life is pretty short,

29:45.533 --> 29:47.076
but we should be good
for about four minutes.

29:47.160 --> 29:48.620
That's not a lot of time.

29:49.162 --> 29:50.789
That's why you need to stay with me.

29:50.872 --> 29:52.207
You know the system.

30:10.099 --> 30:11.643
Down to the end, on the right.

30:11.726 --> 30:13.269
Thruster 4.

30:13.353 --> 30:14.437
It's the last one.

30:32.497 --> 30:34.040
I'm right here with you.

30:43.591 --> 30:44.676
We should leave this place.

30:45.718 --> 30:48.054
No way. We're getting this done.

30:48.137 --> 30:49.556
No, no. It's not safe now.

30:49.639 --> 30:51.516
I'm losing the ability to project.

30:51.599 --> 30:53.351
No. Stop. Please!

30:53.434 --> 30:56.521
No, we need to go back.
The radiation is getting stronger.

31:06.197 --> 31:07.407
Captain Eris?

32:47.674 --> 32:48.883
You're dying.

32:49.759 --> 32:51.344
That shit in your blood,

32:52.178 --> 32:53.721
it doesn't work anymore.

32:56.349 --> 32:59.268
You thought
you're engineered to be strong.

32:59.560 --> 33:00.770
Special.

33:01.771 --> 33:03.189
But look at you now.

33:07.860 --> 33:10.029
You're nothing but weakness.

33:50.236 --> 33:51.487
You came to me.

33:55.366 --> 33:56.826
Auggie, I got something.

33:57.702 --> 34:00.872
Someone manually purged Thruster 4.

34:03.750 --> 34:06.002
What are you doing
with that weapon, Mr. Suczek?

34:06.544 --> 34:08.838
Ha, get the fuck away from those controls.
All of you.

34:09.380 --> 34:10.423
Move!

34:10.506 --> 34:11.340
Suczek.

34:11.424 --> 34:12.759
Except you.

34:13.551 --> 34:14.761
Change the coordinates.

34:15.344 --> 34:16.721
Take us back to Europa.

34:17.221 --> 34:18.723
Don't do this, Mr. Suczek.

34:19.223 --> 34:21.267
It will not end well for you.

34:21.350 --> 34:22.643
Can't you see what's happening?

34:24.854 --> 34:25.980
It's the ship.

34:26.898 --> 34:27.982
It's the ship.

34:28.983 --> 34:31.444
The ship doesn't want us
to go out there.

34:55.927 --> 34:56.928
Hey, you.

34:58.805 --> 35:00.681
Hey. Hey. Hi.

35:01.182 --> 35:02.183
Hey.

35:04.018 --> 35:04.852
Uh...

35:05.770 --> 35:07.230
How are you feeling?

35:09.398 --> 35:10.274
Crispy.

35:14.195 --> 35:15.947
I... I'm... I'm just...

35:17.323 --> 35:18.699
glad you're alive.

35:19.784 --> 35:20.785
All that radiation...

35:22.954 --> 35:24.455
I hallucinated that you were there.

35:33.172 --> 35:34.757
How many of you were in on this?

35:36.843 --> 35:38.678
Change the coordinates or I'll shoot.

35:38.761 --> 35:40.638
Put the gun down, Mr. Suczek.

35:41.764 --> 35:42.932
No.

35:43.850 --> 35:45.226
We're going back to Europa.

35:45.309 --> 35:46.853
I understand your fear.

35:47.812 --> 35:49.605
You brought us all the way out here,

35:49.689 --> 35:50.690
and you knew.

35:51.858 --> 35:54.110
You're having a psychotic break,
Mr. Suczek.

35:55.611 --> 35:56.821
Hand over the weapon.

35:56.904 --> 35:59.991
-You knew what was in the ship.
-Enough!

36:01.200 --> 36:03.202
You know the penalty for mutiny.

36:04.912 --> 36:06.873
You can't stop me.
I've got the gun. You're just...

36:07.623 --> 36:08.457
flashing lights.

36:08.541 --> 36:10.084
And then I imagined...

36:12.336 --> 36:13.671
that Roy Eris...

36:15.965 --> 36:18.301
carried me out in his arms.

36:18.384 --> 36:20.219
I'll say this one last time.

36:21.179 --> 36:22.555
Put the weapon down.

36:23.973 --> 36:25.183
You'll find I can be...

36:25.766 --> 36:27.143
very forgiving.

36:27.852 --> 36:29.437
The real Roy Eris.

36:36.611 --> 36:37.820
He did.

36:46.370 --> 36:47.914
I'm done taking orders from you.

37:07.266 --> 37:08.809
Thanks to Mel's heroics.

37:09.685 --> 37:12.021
We've now regained control of Thruster 4.

37:16.359 --> 37:17.902
Fire all thrusters.

37:20.029 --> 37:21.030
Full power.

37:22.323 --> 37:23.658
All right.

37:23.741 --> 37:24.825
Right away.

37:27.370 --> 37:28.871
What the hell is this place?

37:43.261 --> 37:44.595
Well, well, well...

37:44.679 --> 37:46.472
Cynthia Eris.

37:46.555 --> 37:48.557
This must have been her quarters.

37:52.019 --> 37:54.021
I don't think anybody
has been here for years.

37:55.022 --> 37:59.568
Imagine a little Roy running around here
as an excited little tyke.

38:02.905 --> 38:06.158
All these inventory
must be from their home.

38:07.576 --> 38:08.619
They're all from Earth.

38:09.662 --> 38:12.164
Took it all with her. She couldn't let go.

38:20.840 --> 38:22.341
Rowan, don't touch anything.

38:23.259 --> 38:24.176
Of course not.

38:32.643 --> 38:33.769
Look at this.

38:34.478 --> 38:35.813
Leave it alone.

38:35.896 --> 38:37.064
Sure.

38:37.273 --> 38:39.817
Find what you're looking for?

38:43.362 --> 38:44.488
Joy?

38:46.032 --> 38:48.159
Uh, she's not real, Karl.

38:52.538 --> 38:54.040
I've been waiting for you.

38:56.584 --> 39:00.796
Releasing my memories.

39:01.756 --> 39:03.174
Just ignore it.

39:03.257 --> 39:04.300
Ah.

39:07.094 --> 39:08.095
That...

39:08.679 --> 39:12.475
was our sniveling little daughter!

39:12.558 --> 39:16.312
You knew a second wave of celio
was coming. They warned us.

39:16.395 --> 39:19.398
No, no, no. It wouldn't have mattered.
The virus, it spread everywhere anyway.

39:19.482 --> 39:21.525
Your memory, incorrect!

39:21.609 --> 39:23.611
I said go to my sister's, but...

39:23.694 --> 39:26.155
you couldn't leave your big discovery!

39:26.238 --> 39:29.033
Joy. You know I loved Skye.

39:29.116 --> 39:30.493
-You know I love Skye...
-This...

39:30.576 --> 39:31.744
...more than anything.

39:31.827 --> 39:32.953
...is my love for you.

39:34.246 --> 39:35.456
Stop!

39:38.959 --> 39:40.461
Get out of my house.

39:41.128 --> 39:43.089
You have no right.

39:43.172 --> 39:44.423
I am in control of this ship

39:44.507 --> 39:47.635
and you have no right
to torment my crew or my guest!

39:47.718 --> 39:48.969
-You abandoned me.

39:49.845 --> 39:50.971
You abandoned Skye.

39:52.056 --> 39:55.351
You left me on Earth with a dead child!

39:56.477 --> 39:57.686
How could you do that?

39:59.021 --> 40:00.189
You were terrified.

40:00.272 --> 40:02.858
-Relax. It's another projection.
-It's all your fault.

40:03.109 --> 40:04.235
Leave us alone!

40:13.619 --> 40:15.788
Good night, Karl.

40:20.501 --> 40:22.711
What the hell was that?

40:24.088 --> 40:25.089
My mother.

40:30.636 --> 40:32.471
Your mother is dead.

40:33.055 --> 40:34.515
Her body died,

40:36.350 --> 40:38.644
not before she uploaded her consciousness.

40:39.478 --> 40:40.729
Uploaded it where?

40:43.524 --> 40:44.942
Uploaded it where?

40:46.402 --> 40:47.903
Into the Nightflyer.

40:50.406 --> 40:52.408
She's the one
who's been trying to kill you.
