WEBVTT

00:05.755 --> 00:07.423
- Hi, guys.
- Hey, Phoebe.

00:07.632 --> 00:08.924
Hey, oh, how did it go?

00:09.134 --> 00:10.175
Um, not so good.

00:10.385 --> 00:13.178
He walked me to the subway and said,
"We should do this again."

00:13.388 --> 00:16.056
- Ouch.
- What? He said, "We should do it again."

00:16.265 --> 00:17.307
That's good, right?

00:17.517 --> 00:20.602
Uh, no. Loosely translated,
"We should do this again," means:

00:20.812 --> 00:22.855
"You will never see me naked."

00:24.065 --> 00:25.274
Since when?

00:25.483 --> 00:28.819
Since always. It's, like, dating language.

00:29.029 --> 00:32.238
You know, like, "It's not you,"
means, "It is you."

00:33.616 --> 00:34.992
"You're such a nice guy," means:

00:35.201 --> 00:37.161
"I'm gonna be dating
leather-wearing alcoholics...

00:37.370 --> 00:39.788
...and complaining about them to you."

00:40.623 --> 00:43.292
Or, you know, um, "I think we should see
other people," means:

00:43.501 --> 00:45.002
"Ha, ha, I already am."

00:46.463 --> 00:47.880
And everybody knows this?

00:48.089 --> 00:50.049
Oh, yeah. Cushions the blow.

00:50.258 --> 00:52.801
Like when you're a kid
and your parents put your dog to sleep...

00:53.011 --> 00:55.429
...and they tell you it went off
to live on some farm.

00:55.638 --> 00:58.682
That's funny.
No, because, uh, our parents actually did...

00:58.892 --> 01:01.393
...uh, send our dog off to live on a farm.

01:01.603 --> 01:04.313
Uh, Ross?

01:05.147 --> 01:08.567
Ha, ha. Hello.
The Milner's farm in Connecticut?

01:08.777 --> 01:11.195
The Milners,
they had this unbelievable farm.

01:11.404 --> 01:13.947
They had horses and rabbits
that he could chase.

01:14.157 --> 01:15.991
And it was...

01:18.578 --> 01:20.954
Oh, my God. Chi-Chi.

02:15.218 --> 02:18.095
"So how does it feel
knowing you're about to die?"

02:18.304 --> 02:21.640
Warden, in five minutes
my pain will be over.

02:21.850 --> 02:26.728
But you'll have to live with the knowledge
that you sent an honest man to die.

02:27.939 --> 02:29.648
- Hey, that was really good.
- Yeah?

02:29.858 --> 02:31.191
- Yeah.
- Thanks. Let's keep going.

02:31.401 --> 02:36.238
Okay. "So, what do you want
from me, Dimon? Huh?"

02:38.783 --> 02:42.661
I just wanna go back to my cell,
because in my cell, I can smoke.

02:42.871 --> 02:44.621
"Smoke away."

02:52.505 --> 02:53.964
Heh.

02:57.886 --> 03:01.513
I think this is probably why Dimon
smokes in his cell alone.

03:02.557 --> 03:04.391
- What?
- Relax your hand.

03:04.601 --> 03:06.351
Let your wrist go.

03:06.561 --> 03:07.603
- Not so much.
- Whoa.

03:07.812 --> 03:09.062
Hey.

03:10.023 --> 03:12.107
All right. Now try taking a puff.

03:12.567 --> 03:13.984
Right.

03:15.862 --> 03:19.239
- Okay, no, give it to me.
- No, no, no. I'm not giving you a cigarette.

03:19.449 --> 03:22.784
No, it's fine. It's fine. Look, do you want
to get this part or not? Here.

03:23.578 --> 03:26.622
All right. Now, don't think
of it as a cigarette.

03:26.831 --> 03:30.834
Think of it as the thing
that has been missing from your hand.

03:31.669 --> 03:33.962
When you're holding it, you feel right.

03:34.172 --> 03:36.506
- You feel complete.
- You miss it?

03:36.716 --> 03:38.342
No, not so much.

03:40.094 --> 03:42.346
All right. Now we smoke.

03:45.099 --> 03:47.601
Oh, my God.

03:55.652 --> 03:56.693
No, no, no.

03:56.903 --> 04:00.072
They say it's the same as the distance
from the tip of a guy's thumb...

04:00.281 --> 04:01.907
...to the tip of his index finger.

04:08.539 --> 04:10.290
That's ridiculous.

04:11.709 --> 04:13.168
Can I use either thumb?

04:15.213 --> 04:17.589
All right. Don't tell me, don't tell me.

04:18.382 --> 04:21.260
Decaf cappuccino for Joey.

04:23.221 --> 04:24.972
Coffee, black.

04:26.099 --> 04:27.307
Latte.

04:29.435 --> 04:30.602
And an iced tea.

04:31.229 --> 04:34.231
- I'm getting pretty good at this.
- Excellent. That's very good.

04:34.440 --> 04:35.857
Good for me.

04:49.622 --> 04:52.457
- You okay, Phoebe?
- Yeah, no, it's not even worth...

04:52.667 --> 04:54.001
It's my bank.

04:54.210 --> 04:55.460
What did they do to you?

04:55.670 --> 04:57.504
It's nothing, it's just... Okay.

04:57.714 --> 05:00.340
I'm going through my mail,
and I open up their monthly "statement."

05:00.550 --> 05:02.009
Easy.

05:04.137 --> 05:06.680
And there's 500 extra dollars
in my account.

05:06.889 --> 05:10.142
Oh, Satan's minions at work again.

05:10.852 --> 05:13.312
Yes, because now I have to go down there
and deal with them...

05:13.521 --> 05:16.732
- What are you talking about? Keep it.
- It's not mine.

05:16.941 --> 05:19.568
I didn't earn it.
If I kept it, it would be like stealing.

05:19.777 --> 05:23.363
Yeah, but if you spent it,
it would be like shopping.

05:24.574 --> 05:25.699
Okay. Okay.

05:25.908 --> 05:27.993
Let's say I bought
a really great pair of shoes.

05:28.202 --> 05:30.495
Do you know what I'd hear
with every step I took?

05:30.705 --> 05:33.123
"Not mine. Not mine. Not mine."

05:33.333 --> 05:36.168
And even if I was happy, okay,
and skipping...

05:36.377 --> 05:39.546
...I'd hear, "Not mine. Not mine."

05:39.756 --> 05:41.381
We're with you. We got it.

05:41.591 --> 05:46.636
Okay, I'd never be able to enjoy it.
It'd be like this giant karmic debt.

05:46.846 --> 05:49.222
Chandler, what are you doing? Hey.

05:49.432 --> 05:51.266
What are you doing?

05:54.312 --> 05:56.355
Oh, gross.

05:57.065 --> 05:59.399
- What is this?
- I'm smoking. I'm smoking. I'm smoking.

05:59.609 --> 06:02.194
I can't believe you.
You've been so good for three years.

06:02.403 --> 06:04.988
And this is my reward.

06:06.282 --> 06:09.659
Hold on a second. Just think about what
you went through the last time you quit.

06:09.869 --> 06:11.745
Okay, so this time I won't quit.

06:11.954 --> 06:14.456
- Put it out.
- All right. I'm putting it out.

06:15.750 --> 06:17.376
Oh, no.

06:17.585 --> 06:19.544
I can't drink this now.

06:23.591 --> 06:25.675
All right, I'm gonna go change.
I've got a date.

06:25.885 --> 06:28.345
Is this Alan again? How's it going?

06:28.554 --> 06:32.682
It's going pretty good, you know?
It's nice and we're having fun.

06:32.892 --> 06:34.851
- So when do we get to meet the guy?
- Yeah.

06:35.061 --> 06:36.812
Let's see, today's Monday...

06:37.021 --> 06:38.897
- Never.
- Come on.

06:39.107 --> 06:42.109
- No, not after what happened with Steve.
- What are you talking about?

06:42.318 --> 06:45.779
We love Steve. Steve was sexy.

06:48.699 --> 06:49.741
Sorry.

06:49.951 --> 06:53.078
Look, I don't know how I feel about him yet.
Give me a chance to figure it out.

06:53.287 --> 06:54.913
Well, then can we meet him?

06:55.415 --> 06:56.456
No.

06:56.666 --> 06:58.250
Sorry.

07:01.712 --> 07:03.171
Why should I let them meet him?

07:03.381 --> 07:06.299
I bring a guy home and within five minutes
they're all over him.

07:06.509 --> 07:10.345
I mean, they're like coyotes picking off
the weak members of the herd.

07:11.055 --> 07:15.392
Listen, as someone who's seen
more than her share of bad beef...

07:15.601 --> 07:19.396
...I'll tell you, that is not
such a terrible thing.

07:19.605 --> 07:22.107
Come on, they're your friends.
They're looking out after you.

07:22.316 --> 07:25.652
I know, I know. I wish that once I'd
bring a guy home they actually liked.

07:25.862 --> 07:29.573
Well, you do realize that the odds
of that happening are a little slimmer...

07:29.782 --> 07:31.616
...if they never get to meet the guy.

07:33.578 --> 07:35.120
Let it go, Ross.

07:35.329 --> 07:37.080
Yeah? Well, you didn't know Chi-Chi.

07:41.252 --> 07:42.419
Do you all promise?

07:42.628 --> 07:45.338
- Yeah, we promise. We'll be good.
- We promise.

07:45.548 --> 07:48.467
Chandler, do you promise to be good?

07:56.058 --> 08:00.270
You can come in, but your filter tip
little buddy has to stay outside.

08:06.694 --> 08:08.195
Hey, Pheebs.

08:10.072 --> 08:13.241
"Dear Ms. Buffay: Thank you
for calling attention to our error.

08:13.451 --> 08:17.579
We have credited your account $500.
We're sorry for the inconvenience...

08:17.788 --> 08:20.665
...and hope you'll accept
this football phone...

08:23.920 --> 08:25.921
...as our free gift." Do you believe this?

08:26.130 --> 08:29.382
Now I have $1000 and a football phone.

08:31.052 --> 08:33.345
What bank is this?

08:34.847 --> 08:36.389
Okay, it's him.

08:38.058 --> 08:39.100
- Who is it?
- Alan.

08:39.309 --> 08:41.102
Chandler. He's here.

08:44.232 --> 08:46.608
Okay, please be good. Please?

08:46.817 --> 08:48.527
I mean, remember how much
you like me.

08:50.947 --> 08:54.491
Hi. Alan, this is everybody.
Everybody, this is Alan.

08:56.118 --> 08:58.370
- Hi.
- Hey.

08:59.539 --> 09:02.457
I've heard so much
about all you guys.

09:08.881 --> 09:11.174
Thanks, I'll call you tomorrow.

09:14.262 --> 09:15.679
Okay.

09:15.888 --> 09:19.307
Okay, let's let the Alan-bashing begin.

09:19.517 --> 09:21.351
Who's gonna take the first shot?

09:21.561 --> 09:22.727
Hmm?

09:23.145 --> 09:24.521
Come on.

09:25.439 --> 09:26.898
I'll go.

09:29.569 --> 09:31.987
Let's start with the way
he kept picking at...

09:32.196 --> 09:33.655
You know, I'm sorry, I can't do this.

09:33.864 --> 09:35.323
Can't do it. We loved him.

09:35.533 --> 09:38.118
- We loved him.
- Wait a minute.

09:38.327 --> 09:40.412
We're talking about someone
that I'm going out with?

09:40.621 --> 09:42.414
- Yes.
- And did you notice?

09:42.623 --> 09:43.957
Yeah.

09:48.504 --> 09:51.464
Know what was great?
The way his smile was kind of crooked.

09:51.674 --> 09:53.675
Yes, yes. Like the man in the shoe.

09:54.552 --> 09:55.677
What shoe?

09:57.096 --> 09:58.430
From the nursery rhyme.

09:58.639 --> 10:00.890
"There was a crooked man
who had a crooked smile...

10:01.100 --> 10:03.727
...who lived in a shoe for a while..."

10:06.814 --> 10:09.024
So I think Alan...

10:09.233 --> 10:10.442
...will become the yardstick...

10:10.651 --> 10:13.403
...against which all future boyfriends
will be measured.

10:13.613 --> 10:14.779
What future boyfriends?

10:14.989 --> 10:17.532
No, no. I think this could be,
you know, "it."

10:17.742 --> 10:18.825
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

10:19.035 --> 10:22.495
I'd marry him just for his
David Hasselhoff impression alone.

10:22.705 --> 10:25.332
You know I'm gonna be doing that
at parties, right?

10:29.128 --> 10:31.630
- You know what I like most about him?
- What?

10:32.465 --> 10:35.675
The way he makes me feel about myself.

10:38.512 --> 10:40.055
Yeah.

10:53.277 --> 10:54.861
Hi.

10:57.198 --> 10:58.365
How was the game?

10:59.742 --> 11:01.117
Well...

11:01.327 --> 11:03.870
- We won!
- We won! Thank you! Yeah.

11:04.705 --> 11:07.624
Fantastic. I have one question:
How is that possible?

11:08.709 --> 11:11.002
- Alan.
- He was unbelievable.

11:11.212 --> 11:14.756
He was like that Bugs Bunny cartoon
where Bugs is playing all the positions.

11:14.965 --> 11:18.426
But instead of Bugs, it was first base, Alan.
Second base, Alan...

11:22.056 --> 11:25.475
I mean, it was like he made us
into a team.

11:25.685 --> 11:27.686
Yep. We sure showed
those Hasidic jewelers...

11:27.895 --> 11:30.522
...a thing or two about softball.
- Nice.

11:31.857 --> 11:33.441
Can I ask you guys a question?

11:33.651 --> 11:36.111
Do you ever think that Alan
is maybe sometimes...

11:36.320 --> 11:40.281
- What?
- I don't know. A little too Alan?

11:40.491 --> 11:43.910
Oh, no. That's not possible.
You can never be too Alan.

11:44.120 --> 11:48.832
Yeah, it's his innate Alan-ness
that we adore.

11:49.166 --> 11:51.376
- I, personally, could have a gallon of Alan.
- Oh!

11:57.383 --> 12:00.218
- Hey, Lizzy.
- Hey, Weird Girl.

12:00.428 --> 12:03.138
- I brought you alphabet soup.
- Did you pick out the vowels?

12:03.347 --> 12:06.349
Yes, but I left in the Y's.
Because, you know, "Sometimes Y."

12:07.143 --> 12:08.768
Um, I also have something else for you.

12:08.978 --> 12:10.061
Saltines?

12:10.271 --> 12:12.647
No, but would you like $1000
and a football phone?

12:13.232 --> 12:14.607
What?

12:15.735 --> 12:17.318
Oh, my God.

12:17.570 --> 12:20.196
- Oh, my God. There's really money in here.
- I know.

12:20.406 --> 12:22.115
Weird Girl, what are you doing?

12:22.324 --> 12:24.242
Oh, I want you to have it. I don't want it.

12:24.952 --> 12:27.412
No, no. I have to give you something.

12:27.621 --> 12:29.247
No, it's fine. You don't...

12:29.457 --> 12:31.374
Do you want my tinfoil hat?

12:31.584 --> 12:34.461
No, because you need that.
No, it's okay. Thanks.

12:34.670 --> 12:36.796
Please. Let me do something.

12:37.423 --> 12:38.840
Okay, all right. I'll tell you what.

12:39.049 --> 12:41.551
You buy me a soda
and then we're even. Okay?

12:42.511 --> 12:43.803
- Okay.
- Okay.

13:45.825 --> 13:47.283
Keep the change.

13:48.035 --> 13:49.077
Thanks, Lizzy.

13:49.286 --> 13:50.453
Sure you don't want a pretzel?

13:50.663 --> 13:53.665
- No, I'm fine. Thanks.
- See you.

13:59.338 --> 14:01.214
Huh.

14:01.590 --> 14:02.924
A thumb?

14:03.133 --> 14:04.676
Ew.

14:05.052 --> 14:07.220
I know, I know.
I opened it up and there it was...

14:07.429 --> 14:10.849
...just floating in there,
like this tiny little hitchhiker.

14:12.768 --> 14:15.395
Maybe it's a contest, you know?
Like "Collect all five."

14:17.940 --> 14:19.148
Does, um, anyone wanna see?

14:19.358 --> 14:20.775
No, thanks.

14:21.777 --> 14:24.237
- Oh, hey, don't do that. Come on.
- Cut that out.

14:24.446 --> 14:25.947
It's worse than the thumb.

14:27.741 --> 14:29.534
Hey, this is so unfair.

14:29.743 --> 14:34.038
- Why is it unfair?
- So I have a flaw. Big deal.

14:34.248 --> 14:36.958
Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking
isn't annoying?

14:37.167 --> 14:39.335
And Ross, with his over-pronouncing
every single word.

14:39.545 --> 14:41.671
And Monica, with that snort
when she laughs.

14:41.881 --> 14:44.215
I mean, what the hell is that thing?

14:46.176 --> 14:49.470
I accept all those flaws.
Why can't you accept me for this?

14:56.645 --> 14:59.898
Does the knuckle-cracking
bother everybody, or just him?

15:01.984 --> 15:03.359
Well...

15:03.819 --> 15:05.528
...I could live without it.

15:06.572 --> 15:07.739
Huh.

15:08.449 --> 15:13.119
Well, is it, like, a little annoying? Or
is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?

15:15.956 --> 15:19.083
Now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, all right?
I think it's endearing.

15:19.293 --> 15:21.544
Oh, you do, do you?

15:27.593 --> 15:30.845
You know, there's nothing wrong
with speaking correctly.

15:31.055 --> 15:33.848
Indeed there isn't.

15:36.018 --> 15:37.769
I should really get back to work.

15:37.978 --> 15:41.064
Yeah, otherwise someone might
get what they actually ordered.

15:42.358 --> 15:46.694
Oh. The hair comes out
and the gloves come off.

16:02.252 --> 16:05.838
Did you ever go out with a guy
your friends all really like?

16:06.215 --> 16:07.465
No.

16:08.926 --> 16:12.887
Okay. Well, I'm going out with a guy
my friends all really like.

16:14.348 --> 16:16.724
We talking about the coyotes here?

16:16.934 --> 16:20.395
Heh. All right. A cow got through.

16:21.480 --> 16:22.772
Can you believe it?

16:22.982 --> 16:24.565
It's just, you know what?

16:24.775 --> 16:27.735
I just don't feel the thing.

16:27.945 --> 16:30.530
I mean, they feel the thing.
I don't feel the thing.

16:30.781 --> 16:33.366
Honey, you should always...

16:33.575 --> 16:35.535
...feel the thing.

16:38.122 --> 16:40.915
Listen, if that's how you feel
about the guy, Monica, dump him.

16:41.125 --> 16:43.042
I know, it's just gonna be really hard.

16:43.252 --> 16:45.128
Yeah, he's a big boy. He'll get over it.

16:45.337 --> 16:50.008
No, he'll be fine.
It's the other five I'm worried about.

16:50.801 --> 16:52.343
Do you have any respect for your body?

16:52.553 --> 16:54.637
Don't you realize
what you're doing to yourself?

16:54.847 --> 16:57.098
Hey, you know, I've had it
with you and your cancer...

16:57.307 --> 16:59.100
...and your emphysema
and your heart disease.

16:59.309 --> 17:02.937
The bottom line is, smoking is cool,
and you know it.

17:05.441 --> 17:06.816
Ahem. Chandler?

17:07.026 --> 17:08.776
It's Alan. He wants to speak to you.

17:08.986 --> 17:10.819
Really? He does?

17:12.239 --> 17:14.406
Hey, buddy. What's up?

17:16.035 --> 17:18.368
Oh, she told you about that, huh?

17:19.163 --> 17:23.165
Well, yeah. I have one now and then.
Well, yeah, now.

17:24.084 --> 17:25.877
Well, it's not that bad...

17:28.130 --> 17:29.672
Well, that's true.

17:32.384 --> 17:36.179
Gee, you know, no one's
ever put it like that before.

17:36.597 --> 17:38.723
Well, okay. Thanks.

17:49.109 --> 17:50.151
God, he's good.

17:51.987 --> 17:53.404
If only he were a woman.

17:53.614 --> 17:55.406
Yeah.

18:00.496 --> 18:02.121
Oh, Lamb Chop.

18:02.331 --> 18:04.957
How old is that sock?

18:06.001 --> 18:09.921
If I had a sock on my hand
for 30 years, it'd be talking too.

18:11.465 --> 18:16.052
Okay, I think it's time to change
somebody's nicotine patch.

18:17.429 --> 18:18.846
Hey.

18:19.765 --> 18:20.807
Where's Joey?

18:21.016 --> 18:24.143
Joey ate my last stick of gum,
so I killed him.

18:25.771 --> 18:27.688
Do you think that was wrong?

18:29.441 --> 18:32.151
- I think he's across the hall.
- Thanks.

18:32.694 --> 18:34.195
There you go.

18:34.988 --> 18:37.240
Ooh, I'm alive with pleasure now.

18:38.325 --> 18:41.077
Hey, Pheebs, you gonna
have the rest of that Pop Tart?

18:43.122 --> 18:45.915
Does anyone want the rest
of this Pop Tart?

18:47.501 --> 18:48.918
Hey, I might.

18:50.003 --> 18:51.337
I'm sorry.

18:51.922 --> 18:55.383
You know, those stupid soda people
gave me $7000 for the thumb.

18:55.592 --> 18:57.635
- Oh, my God.
- Seven thousand dollars?

18:57.845 --> 19:00.221
And on my way over here,
I stepped in gum.

19:01.640 --> 19:03.850
What is up with the universe?

19:04.059 --> 19:05.143
What's going on?

19:05.352 --> 19:08.187
Nothing. I just think it's nice
when we're all here together.

19:08.397 --> 19:11.524
It's even nicer when everyone
gets to wear their underwear.

19:14.444 --> 19:17.155
- Uh, Joey...
- Oh.

19:19.741 --> 19:21.951
- Okay.
- Oh, come on.

19:22.161 --> 19:24.120
Please, guys, we have to talk.

19:24.329 --> 19:27.123
Wait, wait. I'm getting a déjà vu.

19:27.332 --> 19:28.624
No, I'm not.

19:31.503 --> 19:33.629
- All right, we have to talk.
- There it is.

19:37.050 --> 19:38.885
Okay, it's about Alan.

19:39.553 --> 19:41.846
There's something you should know.

19:43.348 --> 19:47.393
Oh, man, there's really
no easy way to say this. Uh...

19:48.395 --> 19:50.813
I've decided to break up with Alan.

19:55.360 --> 19:57.361
Is there somebody else?

19:59.781 --> 20:01.741
No, no, no. It's just...

20:01.950 --> 20:04.952
...you know, things change.
People change.

20:05.329 --> 20:07.205
We didn't change.

20:09.791 --> 20:11.709
So that's it? It's over?

20:13.337 --> 20:14.712
Just like that?

20:15.797 --> 20:17.548
You know, you let your guard down.

20:17.758 --> 20:20.843
You know, you start to really care
about someone, and I just...

20:24.348 --> 20:26.933
- Look, I could go on pretending...
- Okay.

20:27.142 --> 20:29.393
No. No, that wouldn't be fair to me...

20:29.603 --> 20:31.395
...it wouldn't be fair to Alan,
or to you.

20:31.688 --> 20:33.689
Yeah, well, who wants fair?

20:33.899 --> 20:37.777
I mean, I just want things back,
you know, the way they were.

20:39.905 --> 20:43.908
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, she's sorry. I feel better.

20:45.661 --> 20:47.078
I just can't believe this.

20:47.287 --> 20:51.958
I mean, with the holidays coming up.
I wanted him to meet my family.

20:53.126 --> 20:56.170
I'll meet someone else.
There'll be other Alans.

20:56.380 --> 20:57.546
Yeah, right.

21:02.427 --> 21:05.972
- Are you guys gonna be okay?
- Hey, hey. We'll be fine.

21:06.181 --> 21:08.808
We're just gonna need a little time.

21:09.726 --> 21:11.310
I understand.

21:16.441 --> 21:17.858
Wow.

21:18.068 --> 21:21.988
- I'm really sorry.
- Yeah. I mean, I'm sorry too.

21:22.614 --> 21:24.782
But I gotta tell you, I'm a little relieved.

21:24.992 --> 21:26.867
- Relieved?
- Yeah, well...

21:27.077 --> 21:29.412
...I mean, I had a great time with you.

21:30.080 --> 21:31.831
I just can't stand your friends.

21:39.172 --> 21:42.383
Remember when we went
to Central Park and rented boats?

21:44.428 --> 21:46.178
That was fun.

21:46.722 --> 21:50.266
Yeah. He could row like a Viking.

21:55.105 --> 21:57.106
- Hi.
- Hi.

21:59.067 --> 22:00.943
So how'd it go?

22:02.029 --> 22:04.947
- You know.
- Did he mention us?

22:10.370 --> 22:12.955
He says he's really gonna
miss you guys.

22:19.629 --> 22:20.838
You had a rough day, huh?

22:21.048 --> 22:23.841
- Oh, you have no idea.
- Come here.

22:27.471 --> 22:29.764
- That's it. I'm getting cigarettes.
- No, no, no.

22:29.973 --> 22:31.223
I don't care. I don't care.

22:31.433 --> 22:34.560
Game's over. I'm weak. I've gotta smoke.
I've gotta have the smoke.

22:34.770 --> 22:37.355
If you never smoke again,
I'll give you $7000.

22:38.607 --> 22:40.024
Yeah, all right.
