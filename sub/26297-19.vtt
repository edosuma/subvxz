00:01.669 --> 00:03.104
ADULT ADAM: Ah, the computers
of the '80s.

00:03.137 --> 00:05.106
Cutting-edge machines
with badass games

00:05.139 --> 00:07.941
like Oregon Trail
and Castle Wolfenstein.

00:07.975 --> 00:10.444
The graphics were
state-of-the-art
and mind-blowing.

00:10.478 --> 00:11.845
I got so obsessed
with computer games,

00:11.879 --> 00:13.881
I even turned to
the black market.

00:14.348 --> 00:16.184
Psst, Atkins.

00:16.217 --> 00:18.719
Word in the halls
is you got the hookup.
Damn straight.

00:18.752 --> 00:21.789
I got bootleg copies
of Congo Bongo, Zork,

00:21.822 --> 00:23.957
and the holy grail
of video games.

00:23.991 --> 00:25.959
And there it was,
the one computer game

00:25.993 --> 00:29.130
that every teenage dude
in the '80s
dreamed of playing.

00:29.163 --> 00:30.698
Leisure Suit Larry.

00:30.731 --> 00:33.434
The most coveted floppy
known to boykind.

00:33.467 --> 00:36.504
This game's got booze, babes,
and bawdy bedroom situations.

00:36.537 --> 00:39.173
I'm tantalized
but terrified.
You should be.

00:39.207 --> 00:42.176
We could go to jail in all 54
states just for playing it.

00:42.210 --> 00:43.944
And it's yours
for 500 bucks.

00:43.977 --> 00:46.914
I've got five bucks
and a gently used Ring Pop.
Deal.

00:46.947 --> 00:49.150
And so I spent
the next 28 hours

00:49.183 --> 00:51.919
guiding Leisure Suit Larry
to the promised land.

00:51.952 --> 00:53.053
This is it!

00:53.087 --> 00:54.688
Larry's finally
gonna get lucky.

00:54.722 --> 00:56.724
When we started this game,
we were mere boys.

00:56.757 --> 00:59.360
But we're about
to become men!

("THE STARS AND STRIPES

Fireworks?
Where's the naughty stuff?

01:02.563 --> 01:04.998
I traded a used Ring Pop
for this.

01:05.032 --> 01:08.001
I'm back to being a boy again!
Which, honestly, is fine.

01:08.035 --> 01:09.637
I wasn't ready.
Anyone here wondering

01:09.670 --> 01:12.506
where in the world
Carmen Sandiego is?

01:12.540 --> 01:14.575
Lucky for me,
I'd still get my computer fix

01:14.608 --> 01:16.744
in our school's
new programming class.

01:16.777 --> 01:18.312
(FLATLY)
Now we hit the "enter" key

01:18.346 --> 01:21.249
and enjoy what the last hour
of programming has brought us.

01:21.282 --> 01:23.551

(KEY CLICKS)

01:23.584 --> 01:26.053
(PINGING)
...wow.

01:26.086 --> 01:28.055
I know,
it's truly exciting.

01:28.088 --> 01:29.823
Now it's your turn.

01:29.857 --> 01:32.426
Your final project
will be designing
your own computer game.

01:32.460 --> 01:33.894
Did he just say
something interesting?

01:33.927 --> 01:36.397
I can't tell 'cause his voice
sounds like a robot

01:36.430 --> 01:37.998
designed to put
other robots to sleep.

01:38.031 --> 01:40.534
Okay, break into groups
and get programming.

01:40.568 --> 01:43.404
I hope you all find
this project
as exhilarating as I do.

01:43.437 --> 01:46.407
Within that boring delivery
was the greatest news
of my life.

01:46.440 --> 01:48.542
I get to program my own game!

01:48.576 --> 01:50.744
All I needed
was the perfect idea.

01:50.778 --> 01:53.247
Let's break it down.
What do all the best
video games have?

01:53.281 --> 01:54.682
This is so hard.

01:54.715 --> 01:56.184
Creativity isn't valued
in my household.

01:56.217 --> 01:58.686
Well, there's always
a main hero, like Mario here.

01:58.719 --> 01:59.887
And see those hammers?

01:59.920 --> 02:01.289
Those are like power-ups.

02:01.322 --> 02:03.191
Schmoo, take your
Flintstones vitamin

02:03.224 --> 02:05.526
so you can grow big
and strong like Bamm-Bamm.

02:05.559 --> 02:07.395
Eating my own power-up
made me realize

02:07.428 --> 02:09.730
I didn't have to look very far
for inspiration.

02:09.763 --> 02:10.798
I'm home!

02:10.831 --> 02:12.266
Wait, that's it!

02:12.300 --> 02:14.802
We'll make the game
about my insane family.

02:14.835 --> 02:16.136
And that's
entertaining how?

02:16.170 --> 02:17.805
I had a good day!

02:17.838 --> 02:20.574
Don't anybody spoil it
by talking to me!

02:20.608 --> 02:22.943
See? Every good game
has a big snorting boss

02:22.976 --> 02:24.978
who stomps around
making everyone miserable!

02:25.012 --> 02:26.614
And we need stuff
for our hero to dodge,

02:26.647 --> 02:29.317
like barrels and fire and
dopey wandering henchmen.

02:29.350 --> 02:31.785
Owww-why?

02:31.819 --> 02:35.122
'Cause maybe I want to sit
in that chair at some point
today!

02:35.155 --> 02:36.824
My game was writing itself.
(NOTES PLAYING)

02:36.857 --> 02:38.759
I even got an annoying
video game theme song,

02:38.792 --> 02:39.960
thanks to my aimless sister.

02:39.993 --> 02:42.663
Wait. That's it!
I got my hit song!

02:42.696 --> 02:44.298

na-na-na-na-na *

02:47.501 --> 02:49.603
That sucks.

02:49.637 --> 02:52.406
Yep, the Goldbergs
would become
an actual computer game.

02:52.440 --> 02:54.074
But was the world ready?

02:54.107 --> 02:56.143
Bevy! I forgot
to take my shoes off,

02:56.176 --> 02:57.511
and now they're stuck!

02:57.545 --> 02:59.347
Damn it,
I'm pants-trapped again!

02:59.380 --> 03:00.914
Eh, we'll tone it down
for America,

03:00.948 --> 03:02.115
make 'em more likable.

03:02.149 --> 03:03.617
(8-BIT THEME SONG PLAYS)

03:07.721 --> 03:09.257
(KEY CLICKS)
It was March 20th,

03:09.290 --> 03:11.525
1980-something,
and Pops was back

03:11.559 --> 03:13.594
from another winning trip
to Atlantic City.

03:13.627 --> 03:15.629
Hey,
your favorite high-roller

03:15.663 --> 03:17.931
is back with comps
from the casino.

03:17.965 --> 03:20.968
And we're talking
drink vouchers, free rooms,

03:21.001 --> 03:23.837
and front-row sets
for a band called RATT.

03:23.871 --> 03:26.274
I understand they're terrible.
Please take them.

03:26.307 --> 03:27.441
Hot damn, Al!

03:27.475 --> 03:28.876
You never lose, do ya?

03:28.909 --> 03:30.811
Come here and rub some of that
good luck off on me.

03:30.844 --> 03:32.212
I'll do you one better.

03:32.246 --> 03:35.148
Call your bookie and put $100
on the Flyers for us.

03:35.182 --> 03:36.484
You got it, big guy.

03:36.517 --> 03:38.151
Just hit me with that cash,
and I'll give him a call.

03:38.185 --> 03:39.387
Put 'er on my tab.

03:39.420 --> 03:40.654
I'm good for it.

03:40.688 --> 03:42.656
So, you don't
have the money?

03:42.690 --> 03:44.992
I'm just saving it
to play the ponies.

03:45.025 --> 03:47.295
Gotta keep
that hot streak going.

03:47.328 --> 03:49.963
Mm.
That lucky bastard!

03:49.997 --> 03:51.499
I'll tell ya,
if I was an older lady,

03:51.532 --> 03:53.401
I wouldn't mind spending
a little time with him.

03:53.434 --> 03:54.568
This is a nightmare.

03:54.602 --> 03:56.970
Relax.
I said if I was a lady.

03:57.004 --> 03:59.907
No! I'm talking about
my dad's gambling.

03:59.940 --> 04:02.810
He just tried to borrow money
from Bill, of all people.

04:02.843 --> 04:04.011
Oh, Lord, she's right.

04:04.044 --> 04:05.646
I'm not the person
you ask for money.

04:05.679 --> 04:07.481
My net worth is seven.

04:07.515 --> 04:10.518
Bevy, the only thing your dad
cares about more than gambling

04:10.551 --> 04:12.386
is doing what he's told
not to do.

04:12.420 --> 04:13.554
Let him go to the casino.

04:13.587 --> 04:15.623
BEVERLY: Wait, that's it!

04:15.656 --> 04:18.326
When he does, we'll trail him
and catch him losing big,

04:18.359 --> 04:20.160
and then he'll have to admit
he's got a problem.

04:20.193 --> 04:21.729
Good idea, Mur.

04:21.762 --> 04:24.097
On your way back,
fill my car up with some gas.

04:24.131 --> 04:25.533
Thank you.
Fine.

04:25.566 --> 04:27.234
Bill will help me spy
on my father.

04:27.267 --> 04:28.536
Wha... No, no, no.

04:28.569 --> 04:30.438
I just came over
for some salsa.

04:30.471 --> 04:31.739
Mur, say something.

04:31.772 --> 04:34.007
Get me a funnel cake.
I love funnel cakes.

04:34.041 --> 04:36.610
And so my mom dragged Bill
to Atlantic City

04:36.644 --> 04:39.747
to see just how lucky
Lucky Al really was.

04:39.780 --> 04:41.515
Turns out,
the old guy still had it.

04:41.549 --> 04:43.250
Hot dog.
You're wrong, Bev.

04:43.283 --> 04:45.553
The man's
as lucky as ever.

04:45.586 --> 04:47.020
Nope.
He's betting his watch.

04:47.054 --> 04:48.422
You're right.
He's a degenerate.

04:48.456 --> 04:50.190
While Pops was losing big,

04:50.223 --> 04:54.127
I was ready to unveil a little
program called The Goldbergs.

04:54.161 --> 04:55.863
So, it's like
Leisure Suit Larry,

04:55.896 --> 04:57.865
where you walk around
and do funny stuff,

04:57.898 --> 05:01.068
but in our game,
it's about having
a crazy family like mine.

05:01.101 --> 05:03.136
For example,
the overbearing smother.

05:03.170 --> 05:05.138
She's there
for every waking hour,

05:05.172 --> 05:07.074
and the sleeping ones,
too.

05:07.107 --> 05:08.776
Then there's a pants-less dad.

05:08.809 --> 05:11.579
He only gets out of his chair
if you touch the thermostat.

05:11.612 --> 05:13.581
And Pops,
the wise, old grandfather

05:13.614 --> 05:15.215
who guides you through
this crazy world

05:15.248 --> 05:16.784
with questionable advice.

I'm proud of you.

05:21.288 --> 05:22.656
Are you?

05:22.690 --> 05:24.592
Is he?
Good luck.

05:24.625 --> 05:27.094
I hope your family
will be okay with you
openly mocking them

05:27.127 --> 05:28.462
for the sake of comedy.

Trust me,
I've been videotaping
them my whole life

05:30.764 --> 05:32.766
and they don't even notice.

That looks like

written consent!

It's about our whole family.

05:57.725 --> 06:00.027
Just let me sit
in my chair in peace, moron!

06:00.060 --> 06:01.629
See?
It's all in good fun.

bonus level.

06:03.196 --> 06:05.499
You throw rotten tomatoes
at her as she busks.

06:05.533 --> 06:06.767
If you get enough
direct hits,

06:06.800 --> 06:09.036
she stops singing
and goes back to college.

06:09.069 --> 06:11.705
(CHUCKLING) Oh, man.
Erica's garbage.

06:11.739 --> 06:13.273
Now, this one
you totally nailed, bro.

06:13.306 --> 06:15.342
Nailed what about me?
What! Tell me now!

06:15.375 --> 06:17.044
Sister Erica,
how would you like to be

06:17.077 --> 06:18.646
in a state-of-the-art
computer game...

06:18.679 --> 06:20.047
No!
Take me out of that,

06:20.080 --> 06:22.015
or I'll punch
your lazy eye straight!

06:22.049 --> 06:23.951
Well, looks like
it's game over.

06:23.984 --> 06:25.619
Or is it?

06:25.653 --> 06:28.889
With just a few clicks,
it's goodbye, sister Erica,

06:28.922 --> 06:30.858
and hello, brother Eric.

06:30.891 --> 06:32.826
If that's an option,
then change me, too!

06:32.860 --> 06:34.194
What's to change?
You're perfect.

06:34.227 --> 06:37.064
I know that.
But the game says otherwise.

06:37.097 --> 06:39.700
Look at that spaz run
computer-me is doing.

06:39.733 --> 06:41.902
I do not run like that!

06:41.935 --> 06:44.137
Yeeeaaah, except that you do.

06:44.171 --> 06:45.606
No, I don't!
Make me stop!

06:47.007 --> 06:49.242
You're just making him
run faster.

06:49.276 --> 06:52.546
Then I refuse to grant you the
rights to my likeness forever.

06:52.580 --> 06:54.247
That's the run right there.

06:54.281 --> 06:56.016
How does he not see it?

06:56.416 --> 06:57.751
That's it.

06:57.785 --> 06:59.887
I'm banning my dad
from Atlantic City,

06:59.920 --> 07:02.590
the horse track,
and all bingo parlors.

07:02.623 --> 07:04.925
So you want to ban the man
from his entire life?

07:04.958 --> 07:07.661
Yes. I can ban anyone
from anywhere.

07:07.695 --> 07:09.830
Ask Murray if he's allowed
in Sharper Image.

07:09.863 --> 07:11.899
You did that? Why?

07:11.932 --> 07:14.267
Because I was losing him
to the massage chairs.

07:14.301 --> 07:17.370
Just like I'm losing my father
to Atlantic City.

07:17.404 --> 07:18.906
It's not just
Atlantic City.

07:18.939 --> 07:20.007
He makes bets
with my bookie.

07:20.040 --> 07:21.408
Wait, that's it.

07:21.441 --> 07:23.076
You'll keep taking his bets,

07:23.110 --> 07:25.012
but you won't actually
place them.

07:25.045 --> 07:27.047
That way,
when he loses big,

07:27.080 --> 07:29.182
he'll keep his money
and still learn a lesson.

07:29.216 --> 07:30.518
Truth be told,

07:30.551 --> 07:32.520
tailing an old man to
a casino in another state

07:32.553 --> 07:33.754
was already
a pretty full day.

07:33.787 --> 07:35.255
So put me down as a "no".

07:35.288 --> 07:36.389
I don't accept.

07:36.423 --> 07:38.225
(WHISPERING)
Son of a bitch!

07:38.258 --> 07:39.760
Hey, Pumpkin!

07:39.793 --> 07:43.096
Guess who just cleaned out
the Tropicana again?

07:43.130 --> 07:44.732
Dad, your luck
is incredible.

07:44.765 --> 07:47.134
I just wish there was a way
for you to win more

07:47.167 --> 07:49.269
without schlepping
all the way to A.C.

07:51.304 --> 07:52.706
I wish, too, for this.
Yes.

07:52.740 --> 07:55.075
You mean my dad should start
placing all his bets

07:55.108 --> 07:57.244
with your great,
new bookie...

07:57.277 --> 07:58.445
Bettin' Joe?

07:58.478 --> 08:00.213
He sounds great!

08:00.247 --> 08:03.283
$100 on
a six-team parlay...

08:03.316 --> 08:07.955
Jets, Lions, Bucs, Saints,
Oilers, and Packers.

08:07.988 --> 08:09.757
There you go!
If you're gonna bet six teams,

08:09.790 --> 08:10.891
they might as well
be the worst.

08:10.924 --> 08:12.325
Well?

08:12.359 --> 08:14.662
Oh, you want me to...
call my bookie now.

08:14.695 --> 08:16.630
(DIALING)

08:16.664 --> 08:19.066
Hello...Bettin' Joe.

08:19.099 --> 08:20.267
Yeah, Bill Lewis.

08:20.300 --> 08:23.937
Can I get $100
on a six-team parlay?

08:23.971 --> 08:25.973
Yes, all the ones
that you just guessed.

08:26.006 --> 08:27.074
(PULSATING TONE)

08:27.107 --> 08:28.308
He had to go.

08:28.341 --> 08:30.110
As Bill doubled down
on the lies,

08:30.143 --> 08:32.145
I was busy
being brutally honest

08:32.179 --> 08:33.814
about my computer-game family.

08:33.847 --> 08:36.784
(8-BIT MUSIC PLAYING)

08:36.817 --> 08:38.451
Turn it down, dork.

08:38.485 --> 08:40.320
I'm writing music in my head
with my eyes closed,

08:40.353 --> 08:41.521
and you're distracting me.

08:41.555 --> 08:42.656
(WHISPERING) Oh...

08:42.690 --> 08:44.157
I like it. That's good.

08:44.191 --> 08:45.626
(KEYS CLACK, COMPUTER CHIMES)

08:45.659 --> 08:48.195
Hey, did you just type in
what I said?

08:48.228 --> 08:50.197
Nope! You have nothing to do
with this game whatsoever.

08:50.230 --> 08:51.498
Really?
Then what's that?

08:51.531 --> 08:53.801
Just a random
sweat-pants-wearing
couch potato

08:53.834 --> 08:55.669
named Eric who thinks
he's gonna be a rock star.

08:55.703 --> 08:58.471
Huh, what a dipwad.

08:58.505 --> 09:00.774
Dude!
You're still making that game?

09:00.808 --> 09:04.544
I told you no Barry unless
he runs as fast as Carl Lewis!

09:04.578 --> 09:06.847
Fine! I'll make you
Carl Lewis!
Is that all?

09:06.880 --> 09:10.050
Actually, I do have a few more
tiny, massive demands.

09:10.083 --> 09:12.686
You made computer Barry
a friendless loser,

09:12.720 --> 09:14.788
which means
you must add in the JTP.

09:14.822 --> 09:17.791
That's four more characters
to design.
Only three.

09:17.825 --> 09:21.028
I'm sending a super clear
but hidden message
to Matt Bradley.

09:21.061 --> 09:23.330
Your demands are insane!

09:23.363 --> 09:25.432
The whole point
is to make a game about me

09:25.465 --> 09:26.834
and my actual family!

09:26.867 --> 09:28.535
Oh, really?

09:28.568 --> 09:31.171
So this is you
in real life,

09:31.204 --> 09:33.841
a hunky hero
with six-pack abs?

09:33.874 --> 09:35.442
My final demand!

09:35.475 --> 09:39.046
You must re-nerdify computer
Adam in the spirit of honesty.

09:39.079 --> 09:42.015
Look, even if I want to make
these incredibly
stupid changes,

09:42.049 --> 09:44.017
my creative team
will never approve it!

09:44.051 --> 09:46.086
And yet, they jumped
at the opportunity.

09:46.119 --> 09:47.888
ADAM: Aw, man,
are you kidding me?

09:47.921 --> 09:49.857
You actually listened
to this butt clown?

09:49.890 --> 09:51.558
Barry's creative direction
of the main character

09:51.591 --> 09:53.026
just made sense.

09:53.060 --> 09:54.427
You monster!

09:54.461 --> 09:57.397
How dare you force me to face
the reality of what I am!

09:57.430 --> 09:59.499
You can't just make fun of us
and not yourself.

09:59.532 --> 10:01.001
Fine! Then it's over!

10:01.034 --> 10:03.136
No one will ever see
The Goldberg Game!

10:07.140 --> 10:09.509
(GAME THEME PLAYS)

10:09.542 --> 10:11.111
Oh, no...

10:11.144 --> 10:13.714
Oh, yes. He had it.
She had it.

10:13.747 --> 10:15.683
The Goldberg program
was everywhere!

10:15.716 --> 10:17.184
How is this possible?

10:17.217 --> 10:18.585
Made a bunch
of bootlegs, bro.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.253
This game's hilarious
'cause I can wedge you

10:20.287 --> 10:21.789
without real-world
consequences.

10:21.822 --> 10:22.890
Balls.

10:22.923 --> 10:25.092
(LAUGHS)

10:25.125 --> 10:28.228
Somehow, The Goldberg Game
was the talk of the school.

10:28.261 --> 10:31.231
Suddenly, everyone was
eager to tell me
their many opinions.

10:31.264 --> 10:33.200
Look! It's that lazy-eyed spaz
who can't catch a baseball

10:33.233 --> 10:35.268
from the Goldbergs game.
Yep, that's me.

10:35.302 --> 10:36.870
Yo, do you really run
all the way home to poop

10:36.904 --> 10:38.305
'cause you can't do it at
school, just like in the game?

10:38.939 --> 10:40.273
Sadly, that's all real.

10:40.307 --> 10:42.309
It's embarrassing
but relatable.

10:42.342 --> 10:43.543
I'm rooting for you, bro.

10:43.576 --> 10:44.644
You really don't have to.

10:44.678 --> 10:45.946
Yo, I got a question.

10:45.979 --> 10:48.982
Why did you turn Erica
into Eric? You're a liar.

10:49.016 --> 10:51.251
Also, why's it always
sunny in the game even
though it's winter?

10:51.284 --> 10:53.386
Dates in general
are all wrong, and I hate it!

10:53.420 --> 10:55.222
Do it better,
or we'll kick your ass!

10:55.255 --> 10:56.890
Guys,
it's just a dumb game!

10:56.924 --> 10:58.491
It wasn't supposed to matter
this much to anyone.

10:58.525 --> 10:59.693
Hey, bro!

10:59.727 --> 11:01.962
Me and the JTP
have been playing your game

11:01.995 --> 11:03.630
and we got
a butt load of notes.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.065
No. No more notes.

11:05.098 --> 11:06.934
But you made me shirtless
in the game.

11:06.967 --> 11:09.102
I'm not Shirtless Rob.
I'm Naked Rob.

11:09.136 --> 11:10.804
Take off my computer pants
right now.

11:10.838 --> 11:12.139
And you gotta
make me taller!

11:12.172 --> 11:13.841
It's like the one
defining thing
in the game

11:13.874 --> 11:15.776
is that I'm short,
but there's so much
more to me!

11:15.809 --> 11:17.945
Also, why am I
not in the game at all?

11:17.978 --> 11:19.980
I am deeply hurt.
(GASPS)

11:20.013 --> 11:22.049
Why isn't he
in the game, Adam?

11:22.082 --> 11:25.652
I demand you put him in
right now! (SPITS)

11:25.685 --> 11:27.520
While I was under attack
from my critics,

11:27.554 --> 11:30.924
Lucky Al's gambling odds
were growing worse.

11:30.958 --> 11:33.994
My gut's telling me Drexel
beats North Carolina.

11:34.027 --> 11:35.095
I'll bet a C note.

11:35.128 --> 11:37.197
$200 on Miss Alaska.

11:37.230 --> 11:39.199
It's about time
someone up there wins, huh?

11:39.232 --> 11:43.236
$100 on the ugly poodle to win
at the Westminster Dog Show.

11:43.270 --> 11:46.506
I know sumo wrestlers
are supposed to be Japanese,

11:46.539 --> 11:49.542
but I just have a feeling
about this Swedish gal.

11:49.576 --> 11:51.478
Lotta good horses
running today,

11:51.511 --> 11:54.948
but I'm gonna take $100
on Last But Not Least.

11:54.982 --> 11:57.284
Okay, stop. Just stop.

11:57.317 --> 11:59.987
Why would you bet on a horse
with that name?

12:00.020 --> 12:01.822
'Cause it's
a crazy long shot!

12:01.855 --> 12:04.657
She just gave birth
and she doesn't take water,

12:04.691 --> 12:06.526
but I got a feeling.

12:06.559 --> 12:09.229
Dad, you lost every bet
you've made.

12:09.262 --> 12:11.398
Clearly, it's time to stop.

12:11.431 --> 12:13.366
Just learn
the lesson already.

12:13.400 --> 12:15.402
If anyone's gonna learn,
it's you

12:15.435 --> 12:18.171
when you see how much I win
on Last But Not Least!

12:18.205 --> 12:19.639
Don't do it, Al!

12:19.672 --> 12:21.909
That horse was 60 to 1
before it became a mama!

12:21.942 --> 12:23.243
Exactly!

12:23.276 --> 12:24.677
Easy money!

12:24.711 --> 12:27.314
Now make the bet.

12:27.347 --> 12:29.349
Maybe I don't understand
your plan at all,

12:29.382 --> 12:31.584
but your dad doesn't seem to
be learning a damn thing.

12:31.618 --> 12:32.685
Patience, Bill.

12:32.719 --> 12:34.254
This is all
gonna be over soon,

12:34.287 --> 12:36.990
'cause there's no way in hell
that mama horse is gonna win.

12:37.024 --> 12:38.625
ANNOUNCER:
And in an upset for the ages,

12:38.658 --> 12:40.427
it's Last But Not Least
by a nose!

12:40.460 --> 12:41.728
I did it!

12:41.761 --> 12:44.364
Who's the big winner
now (BLEEP)?

12:44.397 --> 12:46.066
Wow! Yay!

12:46.099 --> 12:48.735
Oh, we definitely
all saw this coming.

12:48.768 --> 12:50.337
Bill, call your bookie.

12:50.370 --> 12:52.705
Tell him I want my cash
in small bills,

12:52.739 --> 12:55.508
easier to fill the bathtub!

12:55.542 --> 12:57.811
Mmmm, you can't do that
because money's filthy.

12:57.845 --> 13:00.013
(LAUGHS)
And secondly,

13:00.047 --> 13:02.049
you'd need at least $1,000
to fill the tub.

13:02.082 --> 13:05.018
Good, 'cause I won $30,000.

13:05.052 --> 13:06.219
Dollars?

13:06.253 --> 13:07.754
How is that even possible?

13:07.787 --> 13:09.789
That's what happens
when a dehydrated horse

13:09.823 --> 13:11.124
that just had
a C-section wins.

13:11.158 --> 13:12.559
Somebody gets paid.

13:12.592 --> 13:14.494
And I'm somebody!

13:14.527 --> 13:16.063
Ah-ha!

13:16.096 --> 13:18.531
And so, my mom
owed Pops 30 grand.

13:18.565 --> 13:20.901
Meanwhile, my sister
had this waiting for me.

13:20.934 --> 13:22.936
Ow!
All I did was come home!

13:22.970 --> 13:24.872
How the hell could you not
put me in your game?

13:24.905 --> 13:28.075
You said if I did, you'd fix
my lazy eye with punches!

13:28.108 --> 13:30.377
That was before I knew
it was gonna be popular.

13:30.410 --> 13:31.811
If you had said, "Erica,

13:31.845 --> 13:33.546
"do you want to be
in my popular computer game?"

13:33.580 --> 13:35.916
I would've said, "Yeah.
Whatever, maybe."

13:35.949 --> 13:37.650
Trust me, you should be happy
you're not in it.

13:37.684 --> 13:38.818
Happy?

13:38.852 --> 13:41.088
If this game becomes
the next Leisure Suit Larry,

13:41.121 --> 13:44.124
this whole family is gonna be
rich and famous except for me.

13:44.157 --> 13:46.293
And I'm the one
who loves money and fame.

13:46.326 --> 13:48.595
It's my thing.
Babe, I just beat level five

13:48.628 --> 13:51.264
by convincing Eric to actually
take a shower, get dressed,

13:51.298 --> 13:52.599
and interview for a real job

13:52.632 --> 13:53.766
instead of wanting to be
a rock star.

13:53.800 --> 13:55.635
Not now, babe.
I'm busy yelling at Adam

13:55.668 --> 13:56.937
for not putting me
in his game.

13:56.970 --> 13:58.405
What do you mean?
Clearly, you're Eric.

13:58.438 --> 13:59.907
No, he's a guy.

13:59.940 --> 14:02.109
And a lazy, couch-surfing,
wannabe rock star...

14:02.142 --> 14:04.011
(GASPS) You bastard!

14:04.044 --> 14:05.778
No, no, no.
You are not in any way Erica.

14:05.812 --> 14:06.947
I give you my word, Eric!

14:06.980 --> 14:08.115
You just called Erica "Eric,"

14:08.148 --> 14:09.182
as if they're
the same person.

14:09.216 --> 14:10.283
Damn it, Geoff!
I know I did!

14:10.317 --> 14:13.120
I am insulted
and angry and very hurt!

14:13.153 --> 14:16.089
And I demand that you scrap
this pathetic Eric character

14:16.123 --> 14:18.258
and put in lovable, ambitious,
multi-talented Erica!

14:18.291 --> 14:20.260
It's too late!
The game's out there!

14:20.293 --> 14:21.995
People really dig Eric!

14:22.029 --> 14:23.696
Oh, I sure do.

14:23.730 --> 14:25.765
Although I do feel bad
for his girlfriend, Geoffina.

14:25.798 --> 14:27.500
She just kind of dotes on Eric

14:27.534 --> 14:28.801
and gets
all bossed around and...

14:28.835 --> 14:30.303
Oh, am I Geoffina?

14:30.337 --> 14:31.771
This isn't about you,
Geoffina.

14:31.804 --> 14:33.506
And if you want to be helpful,
go get me a soda.

14:33.540 --> 14:34.607
In the game
or in real life?

14:34.641 --> 14:35.708
Both!
Okay.

14:35.742 --> 14:37.510
Enough!
All I wanted to do

14:37.544 --> 14:40.113
was make a fun, little
game about my life,
and now everyone's mad

14:40.147 --> 14:42.682
and wants me to change it.
Lesson learned.

14:42.715 --> 14:46.086
I'm never gonna make anything
about this family ever again.

14:46.119 --> 14:47.654
Here's your soda, my love.

14:47.687 --> 14:49.589
Now I gotta go
get Eric his soda.

14:50.757 --> 14:52.725
(CHIMING)

14:52.759 --> 14:54.361
I really did.

14:54.394 --> 14:56.196
While my computer game
was right on the money,

14:56.229 --> 14:58.898
my mom and Bill
were deep in debt to Pops.

14:58.932 --> 15:00.900
So, the way I see it,
we have only one option...

15:00.934 --> 15:02.469
Call your real bookie,

15:02.502 --> 15:05.272
bet a ton of money on a bunch
of other crazy long shots,

15:05.305 --> 15:07.840
and win the 30 grand
ourselves.

15:07.874 --> 15:09.742
But what if we lose?
Well, we'll just keep betting
more and more

15:09.776 --> 15:11.211
until we're back on top.

15:11.244 --> 15:13.380
Then we are the ones
with the gambling problem!

15:13.413 --> 15:16.049
Hey! Who wants to celebrate
my big win

15:16.083 --> 15:18.118
with lobsters at Bookbinder's?

15:18.151 --> 15:20.020
We need to talk.
Me first.

15:20.053 --> 15:23.556
I dug myself a really big hole
and saw no way out.

15:24.624 --> 15:26.593
I've always been Lucky Al,

15:26.626 --> 15:29.296
and it felt like
I lost my touch
in my old age.

15:30.530 --> 15:32.365
But with this win,

15:32.399 --> 15:35.002
it proves I'm still me.

15:35.035 --> 15:37.037
So, thank you, Pumpkin.

15:37.070 --> 15:39.906
If Pops was gonna come clean,
so would my mom.

15:39.939 --> 15:41.241
Or not.
Damn it, Bill!

15:41.274 --> 15:42.509
Give the man his money!

15:42.542 --> 15:44.011
What?
You know I can't do that!

15:44.044 --> 15:46.713
You stiffing me, Bill?
Uh, n-no, no, sir!

15:46.746 --> 15:49.782
I will leap over this railing
and come at you hard, son.

15:49.816 --> 15:51.284
Do not leap over
the railing!
Don't leap over the rail!

15:51.318 --> 15:52.619
Then give me my money, man.

15:52.652 --> 15:54.721
I don't play
when it comes to my cash.

15:54.754 --> 15:57.257
Dad, stop terrorizing Bill.
He's good for the money.

15:57.290 --> 15:59.959
Wow! I just picked up
the phone
to call my real bookie,

15:59.993 --> 16:01.628
and he's already on the line!
What's that?

16:01.661 --> 16:03.863
Yep, he's got the money.
Well, then, let's celebrate!

16:03.896 --> 16:07.967
Get on your glad rags, 'cause
surf and turf's on Lucky Al!

16:08.001 --> 16:09.302
Ah-ha!

16:09.336 --> 16:10.437
Sweet Lord, lady.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.239
I just wandered over here
for salsa,

16:12.272 --> 16:15.175
and now I owe
an old man thirty G's?

16:15.208 --> 16:17.210
(SIGHS) That man
will learn his lesson.

16:17.244 --> 16:18.678
Gamblers never win.

16:18.711 --> 16:19.779
Except this time.

16:19.812 --> 16:21.148
Yeah, it's not great.

16:22.582 --> 16:24.884
The Goldberg Game had
officially torn my life apart.

16:24.917 --> 16:26.953
(CHIMING, DINGING)

16:31.124 --> 16:32.492
Game over is right.

16:32.525 --> 16:35.495
The only choice I had now
was to trash it.

16:35.528 --> 16:38.065
Good news.
I trashed every copy
of the game

16:38.098 --> 16:39.466
so you don't have to worry
about being Eric.

16:39.499 --> 16:41.901
Or you keep Eric,
but change him to Erica

16:41.934 --> 16:43.603
and make her
a budding rock goddess.

16:43.636 --> 16:47.240
No one cares
about Eric's lame
music career!

16:47.274 --> 16:49.109
I have more notes
on Big Tasty,

16:49.142 --> 16:50.943
mainly that you include that
nickname as much as possible.

16:50.977 --> 16:54.481
No! I'm done writing
about this crazy
family! Game over!

16:54.514 --> 16:56.449
Wait, are you talking
about your computer game?

16:56.483 --> 16:59.319
If you're making changes,
make Geoffina less annoying.

16:59.352 --> 17:01.688
Aw, man. I don't wanna
hear crap from you, too.

17:01.721 --> 17:02.989
Crap?

17:03.022 --> 17:04.124
It's good stuff!

17:04.157 --> 17:06.259
Good?
All computer-you does

17:06.293 --> 17:08.795
is watch TV in your chair
and scream about
the thermostat.

17:08.828 --> 17:09.996
Classic Mur!

17:10.029 --> 17:12.099
My God.
How are you okay with that?

17:12.132 --> 17:13.600
Because it's funny!

17:13.633 --> 17:15.302
Why is everyone
so damn sensitive?

17:15.335 --> 17:17.870
Writing about Barry's
spazzy run is one thing,

17:17.904 --> 17:20.673
but that game strongly implies
that I'm a sad train wreck!

17:20.707 --> 17:22.542
You are.
Ha! It's true.

17:22.575 --> 17:26.146
And that's exactly
how you run.
Ha! So hilariously accurate.

17:26.179 --> 17:28.948
(THOMPSON TWINS
"HOLD ME NOW" PLAYS)
Hey! Don't listen
to these morons.

17:28.981 --> 17:31.618
You keep going
with that game.

17:31.651 --> 17:33.320
It's the best thing
you've ever made.

17:33.353 --> 17:35.322
Wow.
You're really okay with this?

17:35.588 --> 17:36.689
Yeah!

17:36.723 --> 17:38.158
I'm okay with it.

17:38.191 --> 17:40.960
Because it's done with love.

17:40.993 --> 17:42.895
Thanks to my dad, I realized

17:42.929 --> 17:45.132
I had to stop listening
to all my critics

17:45.165 --> 17:47.234
and just make something
that I believed in.

17:47.267 --> 17:50.303
Maybe it wouldn't be perfect,
but at least it would be real.

17:50.337 --> 17:52.172
Are you sure
about these lobsters, Dad?

17:52.205 --> 17:54.541
This place
is very expensive.

17:54.574 --> 17:56.976
We're supposed to be
celebrating my big win.

17:57.009 --> 17:58.878
Dad, stop.

17:58.911 --> 18:00.280
You didn't win anything.

18:00.580 --> 18:01.648
What?

18:01.681 --> 18:02.949
I didn't place the bets

18:02.982 --> 18:05.818
because I was trying
to protect you.

18:05.852 --> 18:08.655
This gambling
has become a real problem.

18:08.688 --> 18:10.923
You think
I don't know that?

18:10.957 --> 18:12.725
Bevy, I needed this win.

18:12.759 --> 18:14.627
I needed to be me again.

18:14.661 --> 18:17.730
Not like this.
None of this is you.

18:17.764 --> 18:21.868
I just thought I could figure
this out on my own.

18:21.901 --> 18:24.204
I'm used to fixing problems
in this family,

18:24.237 --> 18:26.273
not being the problem.

18:28.508 --> 18:31.211
Well, now it's my turn
to help fix this for you.

18:31.244 --> 18:34.414
* Hold me now

18:34.447 --> 18:36.416
* Oh, warm my heart *

18:36.449 --> 18:39.051
I'm really gonna miss
those high-roller comps.

18:39.085 --> 18:41.421
Dad, you're comped here
every night.

18:41.454 --> 18:44.056
I know. It's just...

18:44.090 --> 18:47.327
I thought I was different
from everyone else.

18:47.360 --> 18:48.761
I thought I was lucky.

18:48.795 --> 18:50.797
You are!

18:50.830 --> 18:52.565
You have us.

18:52.599 --> 18:54.601
And we have you.

18:54.634 --> 18:56.769
And that makes us
pretty lucky, too.

18:56.803 --> 19:00.440
That day, Pops realized
there's only one
sure bet in life,

19:00.473 --> 19:02.209
and that's the love
of your family...

19:02.242 --> 19:04.277
As crazy as they may be.

19:04.311 --> 19:06.112
Are you actually
playing my game?

19:06.145 --> 19:07.414
For the record,
I don't run like that,

19:07.447 --> 19:09.616
but it's kinda fun.

19:09.649 --> 19:11.418
And as hard
as it is to admit,

19:11.451 --> 19:13.453
we know you made this game
with love.

19:13.486 --> 19:14.687
I really did,

19:14.721 --> 19:17.757
but if writing about my life
is gonna hurt
the people I love,

19:17.790 --> 19:20.126
then, honestly,
I don't want to do it.

19:20.159 --> 19:21.628
No, Dad was right.

19:21.661 --> 19:23.230
It's what you do best.

19:23.263 --> 19:25.532
And, honestly, it's fine
you changed my name.

19:25.565 --> 19:26.966
It gives me
plausible deniability

19:26.999 --> 19:29.402
over all the stupid stuff
I've done.

19:29.436 --> 19:31.671
And, man, I've done
some really stupid stuff.

19:31.704 --> 19:32.939
I'm gonna hug you both,

19:32.972 --> 19:34.441
and there's nothing
you can do about it.

19:34.474 --> 19:37.176
Oh, lame.
(SCOFFS)
Enough with the hugging.

19:37.210 --> 19:39.078
That day,
I learned what it means

19:39.111 --> 19:40.813
when they say
"Write what you know."

19:40.847 --> 19:44.183
There was nothing
I knew better or loved more

19:44.217 --> 19:45.352
than the Goldbergs.

19:48.455 --> 19:51.324
I am here
with the real Eric Goldberg.

19:51.358 --> 19:53.025
You know, this show
is based on your family,

19:53.059 --> 19:54.361
and Barry is Barry,

19:54.394 --> 19:56.663
and Adam is Adam,

19:56.696 --> 19:58.665
but how do you really feel
about the fact

19:58.698 --> 20:01.801
that you have now become Erica
on the show?

20:01.834 --> 20:04.170
I have plausible
deniability.
(CHUCKLES)

20:04.203 --> 20:07.374
I can, uh, deny all those true
Goldberg stories.

20:07.407 --> 20:09.141
People don't realize
that a lot of Erica's stories

20:09.175 --> 20:10.377
come from your life.

20:10.410 --> 20:12.445
For example, did you ever
break into a pool

20:12.479 --> 20:14.614
and steal a knish
and get arrested for it?

20:14.647 --> 20:16.949
Uh, true.
Um, I definitely
stole a knish,

20:16.983 --> 20:18.551
and I did
get arrested for it.

20:18.585 --> 20:20.152
Did you ever sneak off
to the Poconos

20:20.186 --> 20:21.321
and wreck your dad's car?

20:21.354 --> 20:23.390
I did sneak off in college
with my girlfriend.

20:23.423 --> 20:24.891
And the car rolled over

20:24.924 --> 20:26.959
and my dad did have a cow
at the end

20:26.993 --> 20:28.528
when he saw the car
with the roof crushed in.

20:28.561 --> 20:30.963
True or false... Did you get
a fake I.D. in high school?

20:30.997 --> 20:33.533
False.
I did not get a fake I.D.

20:33.566 --> 20:34.801
I made a fake I.D.

20:34.834 --> 20:37.136
uh, with my computer
and a laminator.

20:37.169 --> 20:39.005
Uh, it was a fake I.D.
from Illinois.

20:39.038 --> 20:40.307
So, did you want to be
a rock star,

20:40.340 --> 20:41.508
and can you sing?

20:41.541 --> 20:43.876
No, this is not true.
I have a horrible voice.

20:43.910 --> 20:45.478
Thankfully,
you have a beautiful voice.

20:45.512 --> 20:46.713
(CHUCKLING) Thank you.
(CHUCKLES)

20:46.746 --> 20:48.515
You'll be the rock star.
(LAUGHS)

20:50.350 --> 20:53.052
Okay, I just programmed a new
level in The Goldberg Game...

20:53.085 --> 20:55.187
Your grade
is a C-plus, Mr. Goldberg.

20:55.221 --> 20:56.423
I found the characters

20:56.456 --> 20:58.157
to be unlikable cartoonish
stereotypes.

20:58.190 --> 20:59.692
But it's a good game!

20:59.726 --> 21:01.494
So good, in fact, that I know
there can be, like,

21:01.528 --> 21:03.863
t-shirts and action figures
and spin-offs.

21:03.896 --> 21:06.098
This could be bigger
than Star Wars!

21:06.132 --> 21:07.867
Star what?
How do you not know
Star Wars?

21:07.900 --> 21:09.602
It's the greatest film
franchise ever made.

21:09.636 --> 21:10.937
Well, that's your opinion.

21:10.970 --> 21:13.440
Rent Return of the Jedi
see for yourself.

21:13.473 --> 21:15.007
I only see movies
in the theater.

21:15.041 --> 21:17.209
Fine, I'll take you to see
the Star Wars prequel

21:17.243 --> 21:18.711
George Lucas
has been talking about.

21:18.745 --> 21:19.879
Is it out now?
No.

21:19.912 --> 21:21.581
But he's been promising
to make it forever,

21:21.614 --> 21:23.215
so it'll be any day now.

21:23.249 --> 21:25.518
If I change your grade to
a B-minus, will you go away?

21:25.552 --> 21:26.619
Good day, sir.

21:26.653 --> 21:28.321
POPS: Ah-ha!
