00:21.900 --> 00:23.180
Holly has a daughter.

00:23.180 --> 00:25.210
Justin is who he is.

00:25.210 --> 00:30.080
I didn't convince him to enlist any more than you convinced him to raid your medicine cabinet at age 16.

00:30.080 --> 00:31.880
He never wanted to be a soldier.

00:31.880 --> 00:35.010
You take you your life and throw it around like it was worthless!

00:35.010 --> 00:36.110
Don't you understand?

00:36.110 --> 00:38.400
I wish I'd died over there, Mom!

00:45.450 --> 00:46.900
Justin.

00:46.900 --> 00:49.380
This word has too many letters.

00:49.380 --> 00:50.870
Is that a "q"?

00:50.870 --> 00:51.950
A "q"?

00:51.950 --> 00:53.040
You suck at this.

00:53.040 --> 00:54.580
No, I don't.

00:54.580 --> 00:57.920
That--that is an "a." I know that.

00:57.920 --> 01:01.640
Is the word "California?"

01:01.640 --> 01:03.020
Nope.

01:06.070 --> 01:07.320
The way they do "carpenter."

01:07.320 --> 01:12.180
Yeah, I'm spelling the word "carpenter" on your back with my tongue because it's such a sexy friggin' word.

01:12.180 --> 01:15.390
God, you are the worst "guess the lick word" player I've ever played with.

01:15.390 --> 01:16.510
No, I'm good.

01:16.510 --> 01:18.090
Yeah.

01:18.090 --> 01:20.620
It's just that your tongue has bad penmanship.

01:21.450 --> 01:24.040
Okay, this is your last chance. You ready?

01:24.850 --> 01:28.410
Now close your eyes and concentrate.

01:33.500 --> 01:35.550
Now it's something in the room...

01:37.010 --> 01:38.420
right now.

01:40.770 --> 01:42.180
Can you eat it?

01:57.420 --> 01:59.470
Okay, that's enough, ?????

01:59.470 --> 02:02.930
Cooper, go eat breakfast. Don't make us late for school again.

02:02.930 --> 02:05.160
I'm wailin' on my skins!

02:05.960 --> 02:07.820
Did your dad teach him that phrase?

02:07.820 --> 02:10.750
No, I did, and I regret it.

02:10.750 --> 02:13.540
How come I have to stay here when my dad's not even around?

02:13.540 --> 02:16.640
'Cause you can't stay alone when you're mom's away and your dad's out of town.

02:16.640 --> 02:19.020
So, let's not have that conversation again, okay?

02:19.020 --> 02:25.570
Plus, last time I checked, your little brother and your sister and I like to see you.

02:25.570 --> 02:27.160
Half brother and half sister.

02:27.160 --> 02:27.750
Hi!

02:28.650 --> 02:30.830
- Hey.
- There's frittata there if you want some.

02:30.830 --> 02:33.100
It's the only thing Coop will eat for breakfast lately.

02:33.100 --> 02:34.480
No, I'm okay, thanks.

02:34.480 --> 02:38.180
You guys love it when your big brother comes to stay, don't you?

02:39.240 --> 02:40.500
Half brother.

02:42.200 --> 02:43.250
I made my own plate.

02:43.250 --> 02:44.870
Paige did, too.

02:49.210 --> 02:50.670
Those are cool.

02:52.510 --> 02:54.060
So how are things with Scotty?

02:54.060 --> 02:56.750
Honestly, we haven't spoken since the Ojai thing.

02:57.140 --> 02:59.160
- Well, call him. 
- I have, Kitty.

02:59.160 --> 03:00.770
He won't call me back.

03:00.770 --> 03:03.250
He's either still mad at me or on an Arctic expedition.

03:03.250 --> 03:05.190
Well, my guess is, is that he's still mad,

03:05.190 --> 03:09.160
given the way you told him to shut his fat face in front of the entire family.

03:09.160 --> 03:10.690
Don't get like that with me.

03:10.690 --> 03:11.820
Don't get like what with you?

03:11.820 --> 03:13.850
As if you're some relationship genius.

03:13.850 --> 03:15.240
You're the lying whore of the family.

03:15.240 --> 03:16.510
And you're the stuck-up bitch.

03:16.510 --> 03:18.020
I am so not a snob.

03:18.020 --> 03:21.300
Yes, Kevin, your little outburst at the table was just the tip of the iceberg.

03:21.300 --> 03:23.790
You talked to him the whole weekend like he was the help.

03:24.450 --> 03:25.070
I did?

03:25.070 --> 03:26.270
Yes, you did.

03:26.270 --> 03:30.180
And at the hospital benefit, you--you tried to pay him to be your escort.

03:30.180 --> 03:30.990
Oh, come on.

03:30.990 --> 03:32.330
I just-- I just wanted to see him.

03:32.330 --> 03:34.090
So you offered to purchase him?

03:34.090 --> 03:35.540
Oh, Kevin.

03:35.540 --> 03:36.860
You don't want a boyfriend.

03:36.860 --> 03:37.800
You want a blender.

03:37.800 --> 03:38.970
A blender?

03:40.570 --> 03:42.860
Some--something that can be bought.

03:42.860 --> 03:43.900
Well, you know what I mean.

03:43.900 --> 03:44.760
No.

03:47.900 --> 03:49.750
He's coming into the office later today.

03:49.750 --> 03:54.560
We won the case he--he was involved in, and the plaintiffs are giving him a reward for being a whistle-blower.

03:54.560 --> 03:56.200
So...

03:58.230 --> 03:59.240
What do I do?

03:59.240 --> 04:00.870
I...

04:01.190 --> 04:05.610
You know, I am no genius when it comes to relationships, remember?

04:05.610 --> 04:10.520
But if I were you, I would beg him on bended knee to take you back.

04:10.520 --> 04:12.020
Bended knee?

04:13.280 --> 04:14.230
Cool.

04:14.950 --> 04:15.580
Whore.

04:15.580 --> 04:16.810
Bitch.

04:16.810 --> 04:18.339
I am sorry.

04:18.339 --> 04:20.470
Holly, thank you for coming into the office.

04:20.470 --> 04:21.760
Of course.

04:22.310 --> 04:23.520
What can I do for you?

04:23.520 --> 04:25.850
Well, it's about Dad...

04:25.850 --> 04:27.460
and the company.

04:28.520 --> 04:29.820
I'm listening.

04:29.820 --> 04:34.440
When my father died, he left this company in a bit of a financial predicament.

04:35.020 --> 04:36.180
Okay.

04:36.980 --> 04:39.100
A substantial amount of money is missing.

04:39.100 --> 04:40.560
How much?

04:40.560 --> 04:42.570
$15 million.

04:43.120 --> 04:46.550
We managed to track the money to a brokerage account in Nevada,

04:46.550 --> 04:51.010
but the account needs an access password, and nothing we've tried works.

04:51.010 --> 04:57.380
Nothing having anything to do with this family as we know it has worked,

04:58.370 --> 05:00.980
and we're at the end of our rope.

05:01.730 --> 05:05.970
Well, I'm--I'm sorry, but I don't know what I can do to help.

05:06.670 --> 05:09.840
You're a big part of my father's life, Holly.

05:10.800 --> 05:12.460
Can I ask you...

05:14.480 --> 05:17.490
is this a picture of your daughter, Rebecca?

05:18.390 --> 05:19.030
Yes.

05:19.030 --> 05:21.040
We need to know, is Rebecca Dad's daughter?

05:21.040 --> 05:22.820
No.

05:23.310 --> 05:23.980
No.

05:23.980 --> 05:26.770
Because the future of this company could depend on it.

05:26.770 --> 05:29.150
Truly, Sarah, she's not.

05:29.670 --> 05:35.520
I'm sorry that I can't be of more help, but she's not.

05:38.130 --> 05:44.470
Well, uh, just in case my father misunderstood,

05:44.470 --> 05:47.680
would you mind staying and helping our forensic accountant,

05:47.680 --> 05:53.500
provide him with details pertaining to Rebecca-- social security numbers, pet names, things like that?

05:53.890 --> 05:56.230
I appreciate this is very awkward.

05:57.750 --> 05:59.160
I'm sorry. I'm...

05:59.160 --> 06:01.840
I'm just trying to save our company.

06:01.840 --> 06:04.870
I'll give you all the information that I can.

06:04.870 --> 06:05.880
Thank you.

06:05.880 --> 06:07.140
Sure.

06:11.910 --> 06:13.120
Thank you.

06:22.140 --> 06:23.560
You know, if you hate it, you can tell me.

06:23.560 --> 06:24.600
No, no, no.

06:24.600 --> 06:25.570
No, I love it.

06:25.570 --> 06:29.350
Um, I'm just not so sure I can afford it.

06:29.350 --> 06:31.960
Turns out I don't have as much money as I thought did.

06:31.960 --> 06:34.010
That really true, or is it something else?

06:35.010 --> 06:36.020
Other than the fact that we've kissed,

06:36.020 --> 06:41.870
and would find it wildly complicated to go on kissing the contractor who comes here every day and builds things.

06:41.870 --> 06:42.540
Are you OK?

06:42.540 --> 06:44.320
Yes, yes, I'm-- I'm fine.

06:44.320 --> 06:45.590
I'm just sorry.

06:45.590 --> 06:46.930
-- All your work 
-- Oh, no, no.

06:46.930 --> 06:48.360
I-I love designing things.

06:48.360 --> 06:49.360
It's okay, Nora.

06:49.360 --> 06:53.560
And seeing as how I'm not going to be the contractor who builds things, maybe we could...

06:53.560 --> 06:55.380
actually go on a date.

06:56.440 --> 06:57.260
All right.

06:59.130 --> 07:00.890
Good.

07:04.860 --> 07:08.590
God, you forget how good fruit tastes when you're loaded all the time.

07:08.590 --> 07:10.130
Oh, this is good.

07:11.990 --> 07:13.050
Who's that?

07:13.500 --> 07:14.530
Are you expecting someone...?

07:14.530 --> 07:15.230
No.

07:15.230 --> 07:16.650
At 8:00 A.M.?

07:17.910 --> 07:19.410
God!

07:22.100 --> 07:23.430
Thank you.

07:32.970 --> 07:34.290
Oh, my God.

07:34.870 --> 07:37.060
If you could just sign this, son, I'll go.

07:44.020 --> 07:45.120
Thank you.

07:49.420 --> 07:50.720
What did you get?

07:50.720 --> 07:52.080
Publisher's clearing house?

07:52.080 --> 07:54.830
No, it's just some bureaucratic government stuff.

08:02.520 --> 08:03.850
Yeah?

08:04.320 --> 08:06.050
Put him through.

08:06.050 --> 08:07.390
Hey, stupid, what's up?

08:07.390 --> 08:09.440
Look, Kevin, I just got a registered letter from the army.

08:09.440 --> 08:11.120
About what? What does it say?

08:12.160 --> 08:13.450
Say what?

08:14.460 --> 08:16.730
What does it say, Justin?

08:18.530 --> 08:20.250
They want me back.

08:20.250 --> 08:25.930
<font color="#ffff00">Brothers & Sisters, Episode 1x09</font>

08:34.890 --> 08:36.380
Hola, Justin.

08:36.380 --> 08:39.190
Por favor...

08:39.190 --> 08:40.169
Sure. You got it.

08:40.929 --> 08:42.460
Four more soldiers were killed on Wednesday in southwest Baghdad

08:42.460 --> 08:44.740
when their unit was attacked by gunfire and mortars.

08:44.740 --> 08:49.880
Since Monday, 14 U.S. soldiers have been killed in Iraq, mostly in and around Baghdad.

08:50.200 --> 08:53.130
Success requires engaging the locals, the soldiers say, repeatedly.

08:53.130 --> 08:56.190
All the while, on foot patrol, soldiers stayed evenly paced,

08:56.190 --> 09:00.880
those on the edges kneeling with guns in firing position to cover their colleagues if necessary.

09:00.880 --> 09:04.900
Across nearly 500 square miles extending from the northern fringes of Baghdad,

09:04.900 --> 09:07.330
the U.S.Army's 1st brigade combat team faces...

09:07.330 --> 09:08.990
Hey, you're up a little early, kiddo.

09:08.990 --> 09:11.260
Yeah, I saw Surfline. There's a good break at Zuma.

09:11.260 --> 09:12.060
You want to come?

09:12.060 --> 09:15.290
Actually, I've got this thing I gotta do called work.

09:15.290 --> 09:17.400
Dad, they're 6-foot swells.

09:17.400 --> 09:20.000
You can show up to the office all windswept and salty.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.790
It'll be great. I mean, chicks dig it.

09:21.900 --> 09:22.750
What a picture.

09:22.750 --> 09:24.700
Oh, go out surfing with him, William.

09:24.700 --> 09:27.280
You haven't been out in a long time, and the chicks will dig it.

09:27.280 --> 09:28.460
See? Chicks dig it.

09:28.460 --> 09:29.870
Thank you very much.

09:29.870 --> 09:30.940
Look at this.

09:30.940 --> 09:33.570
The Hollywood Bowl has Gershwin tonight.

09:33.570 --> 09:34.760
I think we should all go.

09:34.760 --> 09:36.980
Oh, that sounds just great, darling.

09:36.980 --> 09:37.910
Come on, Dad.

09:37.910 --> 09:39.990
You always say today is the first day of the rest of my life.

09:39.990 --> 09:40.710
Well?

09:40.710 --> 09:41.770
Let's friggin' surf.

09:41.770 --> 09:43.250
Oh...

09:44.180 --> 09:45.080
you...

09:45.080 --> 09:47.370
What? What are you looking at me like that for?

09:48.130 --> 09:51.170
'Cause you remind me of me when I was...

09:51.170 --> 09:51.980
younger.

09:51.980 --> 09:53.620
Like all handsome and good-looking?

09:53.620 --> 09:55.380
Yeah, something like that.

09:56.260 --> 09:57.320
Yeah, come on, let's do it.

09:57.320 --> 09:57.720
Let's...go out there and do it!

09:59.270 --> 09:59.870
Wait.

09:59.870 --> 10:01.560
Wait, look at this.

10:01.560 --> 10:02.090
...and getting word from people on the scene that the plane has hit somewhere

10:02.090 --> 10:05.380
between the 80th and 85th floor of the tower...

10:05.380 --> 10:06.750
Turn that up.

10:06.750 --> 10:09.170
On what seemed like a very ordinary workday in New York.

10:09.170 --> 10:10.610
And as you can imagine, the Trade Center is...

10:10.610 --> 10:11.340
Oh, my god.

10:11.340 --> 10:13.880
- Kitty lives, like, 6 blocks from there. 
- Call her.

10:15.290 --> 10:17.480
Oh, my God. What the hell do you think happened?

10:17.480 --> 10:20.270
I don't-- I don't have any idea.

10:20.270 --> 10:22.100
The circuits are all down.

10:22.100 --> 10:23.030
Uh, just a moment.

10:23.030 --> 10:24.910
Word of a second explosion...

10:24.910 --> 10:27.810
Oh, my God.

10:30.070 --> 10:31.610
There was a sunni Muslim insurgency that targets U.S...

10:31.610 --> 10:34.680
Now if you can sign here, Mr. Wandell?

10:36.670 --> 10:38.010
There you go.

10:38.010 --> 10:39.370
And there you go.

10:39.370 --> 10:40.530
Great.

10:40.530 --> 10:41.090
Thanks, Carly.

10:41.090 --> 10:42.770
Anytime, Mr. Walker.

10:44.640 --> 10:46.320
So do you have any plans for lunch?

10:46.320 --> 10:48.230
Lunch--us?

10:48.230 --> 10:50.390
Yeah, I thought maybe we could celebrate with lunch.

10:50.390 --> 10:54.340
You could even buy now, since you're so flush, since we're sort of equals.

10:54.340 --> 10:57.000
Me having money makes us equals?

10:57.000 --> 10:57.940
Only in terms of money.

10:57.940 --> 11:00.250
I-- I thought what made us equals is we're human beings.

11:00.250 --> 11:01.180
But, oh, yeah, that's right.

11:01.180 --> 11:02.220
You're not a human being.

11:02.220 --> 11:02.970
I remember now.

11:02.970 --> 11:03.880
You're a Martian.

11:03.880 --> 11:04.600
Oh, come on.

11:04.600 --> 11:07.490
- Scotty, I was...
- You know, I usually don't like to admit things like this,

11:07.490 --> 11:09.740
Kevin, but I was completely wrong about you.

11:13.710 --> 11:14.470
What are you doing?

11:14.470 --> 11:18.160
Give the plaintiffs my regards, but tell them I don't want or need their reward.

11:18.160 --> 11:18.760
Come on.

11:18.760 --> 11:21.760
- You 
- It took me a long time to figure out how much I'm worth

11:21.760 --> 11:25.340
and how it has nothing to do with money or anything people can point to.

11:25.340 --> 11:31.470
It's taken you, let's see, two months to make me feel worthless.

11:32.790 --> 11:34.910
Congratulations.

11:35.820 --> 11:37.640
No luck in cracking the code to the account?

11:37.640 --> 11:38.510
Nothing worked.

11:38.510 --> 11:40.090
Can I ask what you tried?

11:40.090 --> 11:43.020
Everything Miss Harper told me-- uh, Rebecca's birthday,

11:43.020 --> 11:46.730
her social security number, her favorite color, her blood type...

11:46.730 --> 11:49.990
all those things mixed up and smashed together 50,000 different ways

11:49.990 --> 11:52.740
using the 3 best password-cracking programs available.

11:52.740 --> 11:56.980
Nothing having to do with this girl Rebecca seems to be the key to opening this account.

11:56.980 --> 11:58.070
I'm sorry.

11:58.070 --> 12:00.690
Yeah, well...

12:00.690 --> 12:03.080
Tell me, is Ms. Harper still in the office?

12:03.080 --> 12:03.790
No.

12:03.790 --> 12:05.520
She left as soon as we were finished.

12:05.520 --> 12:06.630
She...

12:06.630 --> 12:08.270
wasn't happy.

12:15.690 --> 12:16.860
Excuse me.

12:16.860 --> 12:18.250
Hello?

12:18.250 --> 12:20.500
No, it's his stepmom.

12:20.500 --> 12:21.850
Who is this?

12:23.500 --> 12:25.580
Uh, yeah, I'll come and pick him up.

12:25.580 --> 12:26.770
Thank you.

12:28.320 --> 12:29.050
Look, tell me. Tell me what to do.

12:29.890 --> 12:31.300
Okay, drink some water and breathe.

12:31.300 --> 12:33.460
Breathe? Kevin, just get me out of this.

12:34.060 --> 12:35.870
I'm not sure I can, Justin.

12:36.710 --> 12:37.740
It's called a stop-loss.

12:37.740 --> 12:38.990
It's basically a backdoor draft.

12:38.990 --> 12:40.320
Look, I know. Get me out of it.

12:40.320 --> 12:43.470
You signed a clause when you enlisted saying they could do this.

12:43.470 --> 12:45.190
You agreed to it.

12:48.250 --> 12:49.540
So I'll just say I never got the orders.

12:49.540 --> 12:51.160
Well, you've already signed for the letter.

12:51.160 --> 12:52.110
So you can't do anything?

12:52.110 --> 12:53.370
There's nothing you can do for me?

12:53.370 --> 12:54.610
No, that's not the case at all.

12:54.610 --> 12:55.910
We can apply for exemption,

12:55.910 --> 13:00.310
but they're mostly only giving them to people who are in school or supporting families.

13:00.310 --> 13:02.370
So because I'm a bellboy, I have to go to Baghdad?

13:02.370 --> 13:02.830
You know what? No.

13:02.830 --> 13:06.350
- I'd rather take my chances in Mexico or Canada and bum around. 
- No.No.

13:06.910 --> 13:09.430
Okay, first of all, the Canadians will turn you around at the border.

13:09.430 --> 13:10.890
Second, Mexico?

13:10.890 --> 13:12.140
You're looking at 25 years in jail.

13:12.140 --> 13:14.110
If they come after me, if they even find me.

13:14.110 --> 13:14.830
Which they will.

13:14.830 --> 13:16.890
They're going after people, Justin, diligently.

13:16.890 --> 13:18.150
You know what? I'll take my chances.

13:18.150 --> 13:20.190
- Justin, please don't
- Don't what, huh?

13:20.190 --> 13:20.940
Don't what?

13:20.940 --> 13:22.910
I can't watch any more people die!

13:22.910 --> 13:24.120
I'm not goin' back!

13:24.120 --> 13:25.750
I underst-- I totally understand.

13:25.750 --> 13:29.840
But I'm saying this as your lawyer-- not going back is a felony.

13:29.840 --> 13:31.410
I don't care.

13:31.410 --> 13:32.520
I'm going to Mexico.

13:32.520 --> 13:33.920
Justin!

13:40.120 --> 13:41.710
This is so healthy.

13:41.710 --> 13:43.880
What--what exactly is in there?

13:43.880 --> 13:47.360
Wheatgrass, psyllium, flaxseed oil, protein powder

13:47.360 --> 13:51.670
Mother, I asked for a banana smoothy, and you're brewing some swamp creature.

13:51.670 --> 13:52.810
It's chunky.

13:52.810 --> 13:56.740
You're gonna thank me when you're my age and you still have all your faculties intact.

13:56.740 --> 13:59.670
Why are you so peppy this morning?

13:59.670 --> 14:01.020
Can I ask you something?

14:01.020 --> 14:03.130
It's a dating question.

14:03.970 --> 14:05.550
Aha, I see.

14:05.550 --> 14:06.470
I see the light.

14:06.470 --> 14:08.280
Okay, go for it, Yogini.

14:08.280 --> 14:11.840
All right, I have a date tonight with David Morton.

14:11.840 --> 14:18.040
Yes, it is a date, and I was wondering if you thought it was too soon.

14:18.040 --> 14:19.710
Too soon for what exactly?

14:19.710 --> 14:20.330
Well, I don't know.

14:20.330 --> 14:21.550
If-- if...

14:21.550 --> 14:25.890
if we were to become attached or a regular...

14:25.890 --> 14:27.390
thing...

14:27.390 --> 14:32.370
I know the recent revelations have not left much of your father's memory to be careful about,

14:32.370 --> 14:34.520
but there might still be a few husks around.

14:34.520 --> 14:37.660
Well, if there were, I'm sure that they're in the smoothy.

14:40.020 --> 14:42.350
Don't have sex with him the first time out.

14:42.350 --> 14:44.190
Just my advice.

14:44.530 --> 14:47.880
kitty, I do not require a lesson in sexual propriety from someone

14:47.880 --> 14:51.950
who conducts her personal life as if she were in a French game show.

14:53.030 --> 14:54.020
I...

14:54.020 --> 14:56.570
I- I just don't wanna shock my children too much.

14:56.570 --> 14:59.510
Mother, if you were to meet someone, anyone

15:04.040 --> 15:07.800
if, you, um, met someone...

15:07.800 --> 15:11.300
you know, anyone, even a-a street person even

15:11.300 --> 15:17.600
upon whom you could regularly, uh, unleash your enthusiasm and your poopy emerald smooths,

15:17.600 --> 15:21.320
I think there is nobody in this family who's going to complain.

15:24.370 --> 15:26.120
Here, drink this.

15:26.120 --> 15:27.720
It might make you nice.

15:27.720 --> 15:28.850
Just leave me alone.

15:28.850 --> 15:30.050
Gabe, what did he say?

15:30.050 --> 15:30.860
It's none of your business.

15:30.860 --> 15:31.420
Yes, it is.

15:31.420 --> 15:34.470
I just had to leave a very busy day at work to get you out of school.

15:34.470 --> 15:36.520
Tell me what set you off.

15:36.520 --> 15:39.810
People don't just punch each other in the face in the middle of a soccer game.

15:39.810 --> 15:40.720
It was nothing!

15:40.720 --> 15:41.630
It was stupid.

15:41.630 --> 15:43.360
Okay, fine, so it's stupid.

15:43.360 --> 15:44.180
Tell me what he said.

15:44.180 --> 15:46.320
Why do you even wanna know?

15:46.320 --> 15:48.290
Because you're part of this family, Gabe.

15:48.290 --> 15:50.060
I'm not part of anyone's family.

15:50.060 --> 15:51.200
There.

15:51.200 --> 15:51.960
See?

15:51.960 --> 15:53.670
That was easy.

15:54.080 --> 15:56.110
Your busy schedule just opened up.

16:08.780 --> 16:15.840
*I don't wanna try to get excited *

16:18.260 --> 16:25.980
*about the motion of my life changing *

16:26.550 --> 16:33.060
*and my mind flipping home alone again *

16:33.060 --> 16:36.890
*at 3:00 in the afternoon* 
- Damn it!

16:38.620 --> 16:40.080
I don't think you get it.

16:40.080 --> 16:42.240
I don't wanna ever see you again.

16:42.240 --> 16:44.870
You or any member of William's family.

16:44.870 --> 16:46.080
It's not what you think.

16:46.080 --> 16:47.990
You don't even know what I think.

16:47.990 --> 16:48.820
How could you?

16:48.820 --> 16:51.680
You're so focused on your family and your precious money.

16:51.680 --> 16:53.660
Well, I don't know where your money is.

16:53.660 --> 16:54.330
I know.

16:54.330 --> 16:57.730
Then why did I just have to sit through all that humiliation?

16:57.730 --> 17:00.580
God, I-I feel like an idiot.

17:00.580 --> 17:01.270
Why?

17:01.270 --> 17:04.630
Because here you are sniffing around, looking for clues...

17:07.670 --> 17:11.450
and I was actually beginning to fall for you.

17:13.359 --> 17:14.410
I've already fallen for you.

17:14.410 --> 17:16.220
No, no, no, see, no more lies.

17:16.220 --> 17:17.349
This is not a lie, Holly.

17:17.349 --> 17:18.680
Please listen.

17:19.560 --> 17:23.060
It started way before the money went missing, before William died.

17:24.050 --> 17:26.280
And believe me when I say this...

17:28.050 --> 17:29.800
I'm on your side.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.070
Holly...

17:35.910 --> 17:37.600
I am.

17:49.960 --> 17:50.960
Does Mom know yet?

17:50.960 --> 17:52.880
No, no, I haven't told her yet because

17:52.880 --> 17:54.580
because you think there might be a way to get him out of it?

17:54.580 --> 17:57.080
No, because I don't know how to tell her yet, okay?

17:57.080 --> 17:59.290
Look, I don't want to tell anyone yet.

17:59.780 --> 18:01.330
Kitty, you have to talk to him.

18:01.330 --> 18:02.450
Oh, and tell him what, Kevin?

18:02.450 --> 18:06.230
Tell him to go away and fight in a war where he'll probably die or come back in--in pieces?

18:06.230 --> 18:10.300
Okay, if he goes through with this crazy Mexico idea of his, he will go to jail for a long time.

18:10.300 --> 18:11.590
Which I'm not sure that that wouldn't be better.

18:11.590 --> 18:12.630
Safer, at least.

18:12.630 --> 18:14.710
Five minutes!

18:15.200 --> 18:17.620
Fine, but you'll go up there and say it's a good war, right?

18:17.620 --> 18:22.270
Kevin, I have never-- I have never once in my entire life said that this war is good.

18:22.270 --> 18:27.730
Kevin, no war is good, but some wars are necessary, and when this one started, it was.

18:27.730 --> 18:29.150
I believed that.

18:29.150 --> 18:31.730
And whether it's necessary now or--or even moral,

18:31.730 --> 18:36.380
I don't know, but at this point, it's world history and it's happening.

18:36.380 --> 18:41.730
Mom already blames me for sending him away to die once before, and...

18:43.090 --> 18:49.190
that fight nearly cost me my entire family, and I won't do it again, not to me...

18:51.070 --> 18:53.380
and I won't do it to him.

18:56.270 --> 18:56.910
I have to go.

18:56.910 --> 18:58.430
Okay, Kitty, I understand.

18:58.430 --> 19:00.370
But will you please just talk to him?

19:00.370 --> 19:05.210
Well, yeah, yeah, I'll talk to him, but I'm not gonna tell him what to do.

19:13.580 --> 19:15.250
Been a while, Mr. Walker.

19:15.620 --> 19:16.830
Yeah.

19:16.830 --> 19:18.150
Uh, yeah.

19:18.560 --> 19:19.810
How's Fawn?

19:19.810 --> 19:22.230
Uh, we, uh, we actually broke up.

19:22.230 --> 19:24.990
Ah, that sucks.

19:24.990 --> 19:26.300
What do you need?

19:26.300 --> 19:27.920
Uh, the usual.

19:34.180 --> 19:35.430
Thank you.

19:36.070 --> 19:37.980
Hey, uh, uh, Shawn?

19:37.980 --> 19:39.300
Yeah?

19:40.740 --> 19:42.930
If I wanted to get, like, a, uh...

19:44.290 --> 19:46.300
if I wanted to get a passport...

19:46.300 --> 19:47.550
You'd go to the post office.

19:47.550 --> 19:49.940
No, I mean, like a, uh, a fake one.

19:51.010 --> 19:53.580
I mean, all I gotta do is get into Mexico and not be me.

19:53.600 --> 19:55.110
I can get you one.

19:55.110 --> 19:57.080
The money's gonna be, uh...

19:57.870 --> 19:58.610
money.

19:58.610 --> 19:59.700
I'm not worried about the money.

19:59.700 --> 20:01.580
Just get me a friggin' passport, okay?

20:01.580 --> 20:02.320
Okay.

20:02.320 --> 20:03.290
All right.

20:03.290 --> 20:03.820
Thanks.

20:03.820 --> 20:05.310
I'll be in touch.

20:11.230 --> 20:15.990
Uh, it's a little stuffy, but, uh, the people are nice, and they can cook.

20:15.990 --> 20:16.980
That's what matters.

20:16.980 --> 20:17.970
Yep.

20:25.130 --> 20:26.510
You're missing your husband.

20:26.510 --> 20:28.080
Yes.

20:29.580 --> 20:30.950
Do you ever miss, um...

20:30.950 --> 20:31.360
Cheryl.

20:31.360 --> 20:32.580
Cheryl?

20:32.580 --> 20:33.930
Yeah, sometimes.

20:33.930 --> 20:34.700
What happened?

20:34.700 --> 20:35.550
Can--can I ask?

20:35.550 --> 20:38.070
Well, to tell you the truth, I'm not really sure.

20:38.070 --> 20:41.550
I waited a long time to get married because...

20:42.670 --> 20:44.380
well, I'm not really sure of that either.

20:44.380 --> 20:45.380
You were playing the field.

20:45.380 --> 20:46.730
Not that much, actually.

20:46.730 --> 20:51.700
I just never met the right person, that person who makes you feel like you'd better hurry up,

20:51.700 --> 20:54.430
like there's never gonna be enough time.

20:54.430 --> 20:56.690
William made me feel like that.

20:56.690 --> 21:00.710
It's been its own perfect little hell, finding out about all his betrayals,

21:00.710 --> 21:07.580
but when it was good, he made me feel like this whole world

21:07.580 --> 21:12.760
like this whole big, beautiful world-- was lucky to have me.

21:14.910 --> 21:16.570
Little me.

21:19.790 --> 21:21.790
Some trick, huh?

21:21.790 --> 21:23.460
Not at all.

21:23.460 --> 21:25.190
Sometimes it...

21:25.190 --> 21:28.470
hurts so much to remember.

21:28.470 --> 21:30.020
I think...

21:31.610 --> 21:33.300
it would hurt even worse to forget.

21:51.250 --> 21:53.160
oh, Kitty. It's been the longest four days of my life.

21:53.160 --> 21:54.560
Oh, Mom. Hi!

21:54.560 --> 21:55.590
I'm home.

21:55.590 --> 21:56.310
Oh, God.

21:56.310 --> 21:57.750
Baby, you're home. Thank God.

21:57.750 --> 21:59.680
- It's okay. It's okay. 
- Thank god.

21:59.680 --> 22:00.750
Hi, Daddy.

22:00.750 --> 22:03.410
Oh, Kitty, thank God you're home.

22:03.410 --> 22:04.890
Do you know how much I love you?

22:04.890 --> 22:07.530
Do you?

22:07.990 --> 22:08.820
Do you know?

22:08.820 --> 22:09.780
I do, I do.

22:09.780 --> 22:10.410
I love you, too.

22:10.410 --> 22:11.170
Hi, honey.

22:11.170 --> 22:12.260
Hi.

22:12.260 --> 22:13.270
I'm good.

22:13.270 --> 22:14.590
How was it, the flight?

22:14.590 --> 22:20.200
Nobody got up, nobody said anything, not a word for six hours.

22:20.200 --> 22:21.790
Silence across America.

22:21.790 --> 22:23.310
That's hard to imagine.

22:23.940 --> 22:30.340
Yeah, the, um, the plane was-was really very empty, and, uh,

22:30.340 --> 22:36.670
I don't know, maybe there were, like, six of us or-- and somebody said to the flight attendant,

22:36.670 --> 22:40.030
"We're here for you," and she started crying.

22:40.030 --> 22:40.590
it was weird...

22:40.590 --> 22:42.340
Just--just...

22:43.070 --> 22:45.580
it flew right over my building.

22:45.580 --> 22:47.620
I was having coffee.

22:48.610 --> 22:50.350
A roar...

22:52.500 --> 22:56.200
I look up, a shadow passes...

22:57.510 --> 23:00.790
and not even two seconds later, the sound...

23:00.790 --> 23:02.530
when it hit.

23:04.190 --> 23:06.090
You want a drink?

23:13.120 --> 23:15.260
I don't even remember much...

23:15.260 --> 23:19.330
when it actually happened.

23:19.810 --> 23:22.480
A few hours after, I...

23:22.480 --> 23:27.500
I was trying to get off the phone with Mom and Dad, and I kept saying, "oh, please."

23:28.390 --> 23:30.380
"Please just let me go."

23:31.340 --> 23:34.960
But they wouldn't let me go, and they kept saying, "You're safer inside,"

23:34.960 --> 23:39.030
and I kept saying, "Please just let me go."

23:39.750 --> 23:42.330
"People are jumping."

23:46.260 --> 23:48.860
'Cause I could see 'em, you know, from my window.

23:51.310 --> 23:53.370
And Mom-- Mom said, "No...

23:55.570 --> 23:57.350
"It's paper..."

23:58.620 --> 24:00.160
"...not people."

24:02.020 --> 24:05.020
You know, 'cause, of course, she couldn't see it.

24:06.200 --> 24:08.940
You know, because they weren't showing that on TV.

24:10.060 --> 24:11.580
You'll be okay.

24:12.110 --> 24:16.380
There's these three hours-- there's three hours that I just--I've--I've...

24:16.380 --> 24:18.280
I've just-- I've lost.

24:18.280 --> 24:19.160
I...

24:20.490 --> 24:26.460
and I walk uptown to walk Hudson Street, and, oh, oh,

24:26.460 --> 24:30.690
everybody is covered in ash and I'm thinking to myself, my God, what is that?

24:30.690 --> 24:33.210
Why--why are they all covered in white?

24:33.210 --> 24:35.770
I just--I didn't-- I couldn't get it.

24:35.770 --> 24:40.900
And then, you know, you see these people, they're crying like...

24:40.900 --> 24:44.380
kids, and...

24:44.380 --> 24:48.050
and there--there are all these people, just...

24:48.050 --> 24:50.180
they're going down--downtown.

24:50.180 --> 24:51.440
They're going against the crowd.

24:51.440 --> 24:53.950
They're--they're going downtown because, you know

24:53.950 --> 24:57.660
you know they're going downtown because someone they know is missing,

24:57.660 --> 25:00.580
and--and I--I'm thinking to myself, my God.

25:00.580 --> 25:02.210
My God, I'm so lucky.

25:02.210 --> 25:04.240
I'm--I'm fine.

25:04.240 --> 25:05.730
Well, you are.

25:05.730 --> 25:07.510
You're home now.

25:07.510 --> 25:09.660
I don't know if I can go back.

25:09.660 --> 25:10.750
To New York?

25:10.750 --> 25:12.130
To anywhere...

25:12.700 --> 25:14.680
to all of it...

25:17.080 --> 25:18.400
to life.

25:18.400 --> 25:23.260
I just don't think that I can live in a world where that could happen again every day, Justin.

25:26.050 --> 25:28.570
I'm-- I'm--I'm so scared!

25:28.570 --> 25:30.090
I--I'm so scared.

25:30.090 --> 25:32.170
I thought that I was never gonna see you guys again.

25:32.170 --> 25:34.580
I really thought that I was never...

25:40.890 --> 25:42.240
You're home now.

25:46.340 --> 25:47.240
Justin!

25:47.240 --> 25:48.730
Hang on a second.

25:49.840 --> 25:50.530
Justin!

25:50.530 --> 25:52.470
Hang on a second!

25:56.310 --> 25:57.530
Hey!

25:57.530 --> 25:59.580
I'm fine, I'm fine.

25:59.580 --> 26:01.790
I didn't ask how you were.

26:05.830 --> 26:07.380
How was work?

26:08.250 --> 26:09.800
You look beat.

26:16.250 --> 26:17.890
I thought you weren't gonna do this anymore.

26:17.890 --> 26:19.750
Come on, everybody who stops thinks that.

26:19.750 --> 26:21.220
It's just what you say, right?

26:21.220 --> 26:22.610
I'm all good.

26:24.540 --> 26:25.710
Hey.

26:35.500 --> 26:36.970
Uh, that's Fawn.

26:36.970 --> 26:38.260
Um...

26:38.630 --> 26:40.420
She was just having a bad day.

26:40.420 --> 26:43.510
Yeah, it's been going around.

26:43.510 --> 26:46.860
- Look, Tyler ...
- I never wanna see you again.

26:47.870 --> 26:49.500
Well, I guess that means I'm fired then, huh?

26:49.500 --> 26:51.600
Yeah, that means you're fired.

26:58.720 --> 26:59.910
Who was that?

27:03.420 --> 27:05.520
Just some girl.

27:05.520 --> 27:07.220
You guys were a thing?

27:09.020 --> 27:10.390
Get out.

27:13.160 --> 27:14.160
What did I do?

27:14.160 --> 27:15.740
You didn't do anything.

27:20.940 --> 27:21.670
What about Acapulco?

27:21.670 --> 27:22.350
Are you deaf?!

27:22.350 --> 27:23.940
I said get out!

27:26.990 --> 27:29.000
Look, please just get out.

27:30.600 --> 27:31.830
Okay.

27:40.220 --> 27:41.180
Gabe?

27:42.690 --> 27:43.820
Gabe?

27:45.020 --> 27:45.770
Can I have a word?

27:45.770 --> 27:47.460
Sure, it's your house.

28:00.370 --> 28:03.660
Listen, I've been thinking a lot about

28:03.660 --> 28:08.940
what you said about not feeling like you're part of anyone's family, especially this one.

28:08.940 --> 28:09.900
Yeah?

28:09.970 --> 28:14.870
We haven't done a very good job lately of including you in stuff.

28:14.870 --> 28:16.940
For that, I am really sorry.

28:16.940 --> 28:18.380
It's all right.

28:18.380 --> 28:20.240
No, it's not.

28:22.280 --> 28:26.020
But the point is...

28:27.210 --> 28:34.790
and I mean this with all my heart, I might not be your mom, Gabe, but you are my son.

28:35.100 --> 28:40.590
When I look back at the end of my life at all the things I've done

28:40.590 --> 28:42.660
all the good and all the bad

28:43.360 --> 28:49.580
I know I will be able to say, "At least I had three great kids."

28:50.640 --> 28:51.690
Yeah?

28:52.410 --> 28:53.670
Yeah.

28:58.970 --> 29:00.820
A kid called me a fag.

29:02.230 --> 29:04.970
I think he just wanted me to get tossed out, but I don't know.

29:05.480 --> 29:06.700
I guess I shouldn't have hit him.

29:06.700 --> 29:11.200
No, he wasn't worth it, but I'm glad you told me.

29:15.850 --> 29:16.720
Hey, Sarah.

29:19.900 --> 29:24.030
What's the deal with those, uh, plates that Cooper and Paige have?

29:24.030 --> 29:25.190
The ones with their initials on 'em.

29:25.190 --> 29:27.680
Oh, that was my dad's thing.

29:27.680 --> 29:31.700
When we were little-- my brothers and sisters and I,

29:31.700 --> 29:36.430
Dad got tired of he and mom having to do so many dishes after every meal,

29:36.430 --> 29:38.880
not that he was ever home to do the dishes,

29:38.880 --> 29:45.980
so he wanted our plates to be our responsibility, so he had us make some and write our initials on them.

29:48.400 --> 29:51.990
He did Paige and Cooper's with them last year.

30:55.910 --> 30:58.140
Oh, you lying bitch.

31:06.740 --> 31:09.020
Oh, my God.

32:15.260 --> 32:17.140
What the hell?

32:17.140 --> 32:18.770
Ouch.

32:20.090 --> 32:21.530
Hello.

32:21.990 --> 32:23.260
Hi.

32:23.260 --> 32:24.780
Just getting in from your date?

32:24.780 --> 32:25.640
Oh! No, no, no.

32:25.640 --> 32:28.090
I was just out doing some early morning shopping.

32:28.090 --> 32:28.800
Really?

32:28.800 --> 32:31.970
Yes, um, we needed eggs and rice and stuff like that.

32:31.970 --> 32:32.650
Staples.

32:32.970 --> 32:33.720
That's nice.

32:33.720 --> 32:35.450
Where are they?

32:35.450 --> 32:37.790
Kitty, I really don't feel like being interrogated right now.

32:37.790 --> 32:41.870
Oh, so you are just coming back from your date, the one that wasn't supposed to shock your children.

32:41.870 --> 32:43.790
Ugh, I'm shocked.

32:43.790 --> 32:45.990
All right, it happened.

32:45.990 --> 32:47.590
I slept with him.

32:48.610 --> 32:50.240
You want me to feel ashamed?

32:50.240 --> 32:51.910
Is that my only choice?

32:51.910 --> 32:53.250
Ouch.

32:53.250 --> 32:54.190
What's wrong with your foot?

32:54.190 --> 32:55.020
Oh, I don't know.

32:55.020 --> 32:57.700
I stepped on some tiny little piece of glass, I guess.

32:57.700 --> 33:00.170
Did somebody break something last night?

33:00.170 --> 33:03.580
I've always told you kids, "glass jumps."

33:03.580 --> 33:06.360
It could be from years ago or all the way across the house.

33:06.360 --> 33:08.420
It's impossible stuff.

33:09.070 --> 33:10.440
And what are you doing up so early?

33:10.440 --> 33:12.350
It's barely dawn.

33:13.550 --> 33:16.820
Justin got a notice from the army yesterday.

33:16.820 --> 33:18.490
He has to go back into active duty.

33:18.490 --> 33:21.020
They want him to report in two weeks.

33:21.020 --> 33:22.980
Oh, my God.

33:23.810 --> 33:25.520
Oh, my God, is he all right?

33:25.520 --> 33:26.120
Where is he?

33:26.120 --> 33:27.350
I'm assuming that he's at his place.

33:27.350 --> 33:28.540
I'm gonna go over there this morning

33:28.540 --> 33:31.330
- to tell him to go? To get himself killed in this ridiculous war? 
- No, no, no.

33:31.330 --> 33:33.540
No, Mother! I'm just gonna tell him that I'm here for him, and I'm--

33:33.540 --> 33:37.900
I'm just gonna tell him that we're all here for him. Don't...

33:38.960 --> 33:40.400
He's got some crazy idea.

33:40.400 --> 33:42.720
He told kevin that if he goes to Mexico or something,

33:42.720 --> 33:44.000
I don't know, if he does - he'll go to jail.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.220
Yes, if they catch him, he will go to jail, right.

33:46.220 --> 33:47.400
I'm going with you.

33:47.400 --> 33:48.730
Good. I...

33:48.730 --> 33:50.130
I wish you would.

33:55.350 --> 33:57.120
I just wanna know what the hell you're hiding.

33:57.120 --> 34:02.200
I am not hiding anything. You cannot come in here to my house and talk like that.

34:02.200 --> 34:07.010
No, but you can condemn my whole family to bankruptcy and worse to stop the truth about your life coming out,

34:07.010 --> 34:08.730
but I can't call you names?

34:08.730 --> 34:09.510
Are you kidding me?

34:09.510 --> 34:10.670
What do you know?

34:10.670 --> 34:14.679
- Or think you know, because I - I know that Rebecca is my father's daughter.

34:14.679 --> 34:15.770
She's not!

34:15.770 --> 34:22.710
Then why did adding her initials to ours unlock the accounts I have been trying to open for months?

34:22.710 --> 34:24.510
Your father was mistaken.

34:24.510 --> 34:25.400
No, he wasn't.

34:25.400 --> 34:26.739
You know why?

34:26.739 --> 34:28.420
I figured it out.

34:28.420 --> 34:33.060
The only reason that you would work so hard at trying to keep this from coming out

34:33.060 --> 34:36.429
when the stakes are so high is that you haven't told her either.

34:37.830 --> 34:39.310
Sarah?

34:41.409 --> 34:42.739
Sarah.

34:43.429 --> 34:45.489
Don't say a word.

34:55.600 --> 34:57.510
I got pregnant.

34:58.090 --> 35:00.020
We had always been really careful.

35:00.020 --> 35:02.240
I still don't even know how it happened.

35:02.240 --> 35:08.510
But I knew your father well enough to know that if he knew I was having his child, he...

35:08.510 --> 35:14.730
he would be compelled to leave you all, and I couldn't have that,

35:14.730 --> 35:21.350
so I told him it was someone else's-- a director on a movie, a one-night stand.

35:23.980 --> 35:30.020
But I never asked him for anything, not a cent, not a favor...

35:30.490 --> 35:36.060
and Rebecca had to live her whole life thinking her father was a nobody, a mistake.

35:36.060 --> 35:42.960
But it kept you from losing him, and it kept me with a man who still thought,

35:42.960 --> 35:45.890
in his own way, that he was a hero...

35:48.160 --> 35:51.880
because he never would've forgiven himself for leaving you...

35:53.760 --> 35:56.030
or deserting his daughter.

35:58.840 --> 36:05.830
and I don't know-- I don't know how I'm gonna tell her that I have been lying all these years.

36:06.750 --> 36:07.950
I can't.

36:16.090 --> 36:18.220
I don't care what you do...

36:19.410 --> 36:22.320
just stay the hell away from my family.

36:23.180 --> 36:25.820
You've got a decision to make, old man.

36:34.880 --> 36:37.650
Hi, uh, Scotty, it's, um...

36:37.650 --> 36:40.080
it's--it's--it's Kevin, your...

36:41.030 --> 36:42.960
your least favorite Martian.

36:42.960 --> 36:46.510
Look, I--I've--I've been on your planet for 34 years,

36:46.510 --> 36:50.390
and I still get a lot of things wrong, like about,

36:50.390 --> 36:56.630
um, money and work and people and life and...love...

36:57.780 --> 36:59.480
everything.

36:59.480 --> 37:06.960
Anyway, I-I just wanted you to know I-I think you're amazing and funny and cute as hell,

37:06.960 --> 37:13.180
and I just hope that someday, maybe-- I don't know, three Martian years from now,

37:13.180 --> 37:14.750
'cause our years are longer than yours--

37:14.750 --> 37:24.730
maybe I could be worthy of your human love and respect, whether we're together or not.

37:24.730 --> 37:26.440
That's all.

37:28.510 --> 37:29.520
Hi.

37:31.040 --> 37:32.210
Hi.

37:34.640 --> 37:37.990
Please tell me this is the part where you let me off the hook.

37:38.720 --> 37:39.920
It's not.

37:43.610 --> 37:44.710
Okay.

37:45.820 --> 37:48.910
This is the part where I say, "Thank you..."

37:50.460 --> 37:52.540
and, um...

37:54.200 --> 37:56.670
"Could you please send me the check?"

37:56.670 --> 37:58.610
I already did.

38:00.060 --> 38:02.280
Okay, then.

38:05.740 --> 38:07.120
Bye.

38:08.260 --> 38:09.770
Bye.

38:11.900 --> 38:12.470
Justin?

38:12.470 --> 38:15.120
Justin!

38:15.120 --> 38:15.630
Hey!

38:15.630 --> 38:17.130
He's sleeping.

38:17.610 --> 38:18.600
Hey.

38:19.600 --> 38:20.740
Hey, Justin, wake up.

38:20.740 --> 38:22.060
Come on.

38:22.060 --> 38:23.210
Justin.

38:23.210 --> 38:25.000
Justin, wake up!

38:25.000 --> 38:25.630
Justin.

38:25.630 --> 38:26.630
Hey, Kitty, call 9-1-1.

38:26.630 --> 38:27.340
I'm already doing it.

38:27.340 --> 38:29.390
Justin, Justin, wake up!

38:29.390 --> 38:30.280
This is all my fault.

38:30.280 --> 38:31.130
It's his own fault, Mom.

38:31.130 --> 38:31.830
No, it's my fault.

38:31.830 --> 38:32.950
What-- what-- what does that mean?

38:32.950 --> 38:34.040
Tommy, I just know it.

38:34.040 --> 38:35.810
Yes, uh, we need an ambulance right away.

38:35.810 --> 38:37.070
Justin, Justin!

38:37.070 --> 38:38.890
Oh, Justin, please, wake up!

38:38.890 --> 38:39.400
Wake up!

38:39.400 --> 38:40.480
Wake up, Justin!

38:40.480 --> 38:42.300
Oh, Justin, no!

38:42.300 --> 38:44.970
Look, just like that, we bomb them now back to the stone age.

38:44.970 --> 38:46.220
Tommy, it's not that simple.

38:46.220 --> 38:47.140
Tommy, stop.

38:47.140 --> 38:48.480
No, Tommy's making his point.

38:48.480 --> 38:51.560
There are millions of people in Afghanistan who are not terrorists.

38:51.560 --> 38:52.630
They're just innocent people.

38:52.630 --> 38:55.570
Every human in those towers was innocent, Mom.

38:55.570 --> 38:58.600
Carl Leiter's son was in one of those buildings.

38:58.600 --> 38:59.440
We know people.

38:59.440 --> 39:00.480
Yes, I know, William.

39:00.480 --> 39:01.180
I know.

39:01.180 --> 39:05.090
- I just don't think we should launch into an out-and-out war 
- Mom, we're already at war!

39:05.090 --> 39:06.750
We just haven't started fighting back yet.

39:06.750 --> 39:07.790
You know...

39:07.790 --> 39:09.560
I would like some wine, please.

39:09.560 --> 39:10.670
Sure.

39:13.560 --> 39:14.090
Thanks.

39:14.090 --> 39:16.740
You know, it's just that...

39:18.050 --> 39:19.750
and, you know, to eat...

39:20.560 --> 39:22.790
just five minutes with--without...

39:22.790 --> 39:26.460
Yeah, yeah, she's right, let's just, uh, stop.

39:29.230 --> 39:32.300
The world outside this house, we can't control,

39:32.300 --> 39:37.230
not with bombs, not with diplomacy and not even with love.

39:37.230 --> 39:38.950
We know that now.

39:40.510 --> 39:44.650
The best thing we can possibly do now is just appreciate one another,

39:45.570 --> 39:50.240
right here, right now, together like this.

39:51.830 --> 39:55.920
Family is the only sure thing in life.

39:56.500 --> 39:58.610
Always was, always will be.

40:01.480 --> 40:04.100
Could we maybe pray?

40:04.820 --> 40:06.110
Yes, we should.

40:06.360 --> 40:08.790
This certainly is the circumstances for it.

40:09.340 --> 40:10.710
Thank you.

40:14.010 --> 40:15.900
Thank you, God...

40:16.930 --> 40:24.280
for bringing us together tonight in very difficult circumstances...

40:26.400 --> 40:27.330
Please don't die.

40:27.330 --> 40:29.380
Thank you for the blessings we have,

40:29.380 --> 40:35.940
our family, our friends, and, uh, Lord, if you're up there,

40:35.940 --> 40:41.800
please look after and comfort the souls that perished in those planes

40:41.800 --> 40:48.330
and in those buildings and their families tonight.

40:50.450 --> 40:52.050
He's gonna be okay.

40:52.050 --> 40:53.700
I know.

40:56.840 --> 40:58.660
We're in your hands, Lord.

40:59.450 --> 41:00.830
Help us.

41:01.940 --> 41:02.520
Amen.

41:02.520 --> 41:04.100
Amen.

41:07.750 --> 41:08.800
Okay.

41:15.780 --> 41:16.770
Uh, guys?

41:20.560 --> 41:21.630
What?

41:23.840 --> 41:25.690
You want to say something?

41:27.280 --> 41:28.210
I do.

41:33.870 --> 41:36.950
Look, I love you guys more than anything in the whole world,

41:36.950 --> 41:40.620
and I've been doing a lot of thinking over the past few days.

41:42.670 --> 41:46.880
I can't just sit here and let these people tear apart my family like this.

41:48.540 --> 41:50.140
My god, Kitty, they almost killed you.

41:50.140 --> 41:51.400
No.

41:51.690 --> 41:52.150
Justin, I'm fine.

41:52.150 --> 41:52.820
I'm here now.

41:52.820 --> 41:53.220
It's okay.

41:53.220 --> 41:57.640
I know. Okay, but the same thing could happen tomorrow, or they could do something even worse.

41:57.640 --> 41:59.520
It--it's just not right.

41:59.520 --> 42:01.690
Justin, what's the matter?

42:04.070 --> 42:05.570
Nothing's the matter.

42:11.080 --> 42:12.370
I enlisted today.
