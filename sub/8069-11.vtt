[theme music playing]

00:54.388 --> 00:55.656
Hello.
Hi, Gloria.

00:55.689 --> 00:56.557
It's Roseanne.

00:56.590 --> 00:57.891
Did Darlene come
home with Cindy?

00:57.925 --> 01:00.961
Yeah, no, OK, well, if she
does come over there, tell her

01:00.994 --> 01:02.363
I need her to get her
butt home right away.

01:02.396 --> 01:04.265
Thanks.
Bye.

01:04.298 --> 01:05.733
Mother, when
can I talk to you?

01:05.766 --> 01:07.335
How's June?

01:07.368 --> 01:08.236
I'm serious.

01:08.269 --> 01:09.703
I need to talk about Jimmy.

01:09.737 --> 01:11.405
We're having problems.

01:11.439 --> 01:12.973
Can we talk about it
tomorrow over breakfast?

01:13.006 --> 01:14.575
Oh, sure, in
front of everyone.

01:14.608 --> 01:16.110
Well, do you want me
to wake you when I come

01:16.144 --> 01:18.112
home at 2:30 in the morning?

01:18.146 --> 01:19.847
Mother, I haven't
seen you all week.

01:19.880 --> 01:21.849
You're neglecting me.
- I know, honey.

01:21.882 --> 01:23.016
But it's nothing personal.

01:23.050 --> 01:26.187
I'm neglecting your
brother and sister too.

01:26.220 --> 01:27.121
Very funny.

01:31.725 --> 01:35.629
OK, I'll be in the shower
at 6:00 tomorrow morning.

01:35.663 --> 01:36.864
You can talk to me then.

01:36.897 --> 01:37.765
OK.

01:37.798 --> 01:39.200
It's a date.

01:42.102 --> 01:44.338
Dan, right?

01:44.372 --> 01:46.174
Right.

01:46.207 --> 01:48.176
I thought you said you're
going to be home early today.

01:48.209 --> 01:50.378
A man can dream, can't he?

01:50.411 --> 01:52.413
Well, Joey messed
up the lumber order.

01:52.446 --> 01:54.415
Once he finally got it
right, he sent it to the job

01:54.448 --> 01:56.884
we were working at last week.

01:56.917 --> 01:59.052
Maybe the driver was
just too embarrassed

01:59.086 --> 02:01.155
to go over to the Red
Velvet Massage Parlor.

02:04.158 --> 02:05.159
Maybe.

02:05.193 --> 02:06.427
But you were
there, weren't you?

02:06.460 --> 02:07.695
Bright and early.

02:07.728 --> 02:09.997
Roseanne, it's
a job, all right.

02:10.030 --> 02:11.131
Give me a break.

02:11.165 --> 02:13.534
Well, you must be so
proud working there.

02:13.567 --> 02:15.102
Of course, it doesn't
have the prestige

02:15.135 --> 02:18.239
of working at Chicken Divine
or the Lobo Lounge, but--

02:18.272 --> 02:20.441
It's a massage parlor, Dan.

02:20.474 --> 02:24.978
At least the only breast I
see are dipped in batter.

02:25.012 --> 02:26.914
Same here.

02:26.947 --> 02:29.317
[music playing]

02:33.354 --> 02:34.788
I hate this place.

02:34.822 --> 02:36.290
I hate this place.

02:36.324 --> 02:37.258
I hate this place.

02:37.291 --> 02:39.227
How you doing, Lizzie?

02:39.260 --> 02:40.228
Oh, fine.

02:40.261 --> 02:41.695
What you got?

02:41.729 --> 02:42.796
You're going to love this.

02:42.830 --> 02:45.599
I need a Long Island
iced tea, a sloe gin

02:45.633 --> 02:47.801
fizz, and a golden Cadillac.

02:47.835 --> 02:50.103
Three shots coming up.

02:50.137 --> 02:51.605
Stick umbrellas
in them, they'll

02:51.639 --> 02:52.673
never know the difference.

02:52.706 --> 02:54.074
Yeah.

02:54.107 --> 02:56.810
Oh, Darlene called
and said, and I

02:56.844 --> 02:58.812
quote, "Do not pass a cow.

02:58.846 --> 02:59.847
I am home."

02:59.880 --> 03:01.148
Oh, great.

03:01.181 --> 03:02.416
Hey, how's your kid doing?
Better?

03:02.450 --> 03:03.317
Yeah.

03:03.351 --> 03:04.218
He's coughing some.

03:04.252 --> 03:05.986
But my mom's got him tonight.

03:06.019 --> 03:07.455
How about yours?
- Oh, they're OK.

03:07.488 --> 03:08.389
Of course, I don't know.

03:08.422 --> 03:10.157
I only see them
20 minutes a day.

03:10.190 --> 03:12.226
How's Dan?
[banging]

03:12.260 --> 03:13.894
Sorry.

03:13.927 --> 03:16.364
Is that my head, or
do you want something?

03:16.397 --> 03:17.431
I could use another.

03:17.465 --> 03:20.167
What, another liver?

03:20.200 --> 03:22.169
Yeah, last year we
went up to Lake Wapello.

03:22.202 --> 03:23.871
Of course, by the
time we got up there,

03:23.904 --> 03:25.906
it was too late to do any
fishing because the wife

03:25.939 --> 03:27.475
doesn't know how to read a map.

03:27.508 --> 03:29.810
Well, you know reading
maps are more a guy's thing

03:29.843 --> 03:31.545
I think because
only guys understand

03:31.579 --> 03:34.615
one inch equaling 100 miles.

03:34.648 --> 03:37.251
Isn't that Annie
Clemens husband?

03:37.285 --> 03:38.218
Where?

03:38.252 --> 03:40.988
There, latched
onto that blonde.

03:41.021 --> 03:42.490
Sure is.

03:42.523 --> 03:43.824
What a creep.

03:43.857 --> 03:45.493
I hate men.

03:45.526 --> 03:46.494
I hate blondes.

03:46.527 --> 03:48.629
I hate this whole place.

03:48.662 --> 03:52.800
Lizzie, would you go
home with me tonight?

03:52.833 --> 03:54.735
What do you think?

03:54.768 --> 03:56.370
Hey, Larry.

03:56.404 --> 03:57.838
Hi, Rosie.

03:57.871 --> 03:58.839
How's your wife?

03:58.872 --> 03:59.673
Fine, fine.

04:03.411 --> 04:05.746
How come you ain't wearing
your wedding ring, Larry?

04:05.779 --> 04:07.715
Ooh, easy, easy.

04:07.748 --> 04:10.918
Hey, you're wife's due
any day now isn't she?

04:10.951 --> 04:13.220
So what's that
make, five kids now?

04:13.253 --> 04:15.389
Billy and Petey and Randy.

04:15.423 --> 04:16.324
Easy, easy.

04:16.357 --> 04:18.792
Give her my regards, Larry.

04:18.826 --> 04:22.229
[music playing]

04:40.714 --> 04:41.649
Dan?

04:41.682 --> 04:44.652
Honey, I'm home.

04:44.685 --> 04:47.054
[snorts]

04:50.157 --> 04:53.527
[music playing]

05:02.069 --> 05:05.439
[alarm buzzes]

05:47.247 --> 05:48.048
Get off me.

06:04.398 --> 06:07.267
[music playing]

06:10.804 --> 06:12.272
[kissing sound]

06:12.305 --> 06:15.142
Gee Dan, that
was almost a kiss.

06:15.175 --> 06:16.710
Almost.

06:16.744 --> 06:21.014
I'm really getting tired of
cold sandwiches for dinner.

06:21.048 --> 06:23.517
Maybe if your father had made
sure you girls did the dishes,

06:23.551 --> 06:25.753
I wouldn't had to do them
when I came last night at 2:30

06:25.786 --> 06:27.855
in the morning, and I would
have had more time to fix

06:27.888 --> 06:29.222
something hot for dinner.

06:29.256 --> 06:31.258
But obviously, he
was just too busy

06:31.291 --> 06:34.862
watching Monday Night Football
or Tuesday night butt ball

06:34.895 --> 06:37.397
or whatever the hell
it is he watches.

06:37.431 --> 06:39.800
Believe me, I was watching
Darlene do her homework.

06:39.833 --> 06:43.170
Ooh how dare I take a second
job when there's seventh grade

06:43.203 --> 06:44.772
algebra to be done.

06:44.805 --> 06:46.540
It's not worth
fighting about, you guys.

06:46.574 --> 06:47.908
I've got more to do tonight.

06:47.941 --> 06:49.943
You know, seeing as how you're
the only one around here who

06:49.977 --> 06:51.712
has a job, I'll see if
I can do the housework

06:51.745 --> 06:54.047
tonight to your satisfaction,
your royal highness.

06:54.081 --> 06:56.049
Of course, I was just
playing Johnny builder

06:56.083 --> 06:58.151
with my little pals all day.

06:58.185 --> 07:00.654
Oh Dan, are you
feeling ignored?

07:00.688 --> 07:02.022
Are you feeling unappreciated?

07:02.055 --> 07:06.059
You're going to be feeling
single in about two seconds.

07:06.093 --> 07:08.529
Oh, well, there's
a huge threat.

07:08.562 --> 07:10.130
You guys are so weak.

07:10.163 --> 07:11.999
Are you going to get around
to doing laundry sometime,

07:12.032 --> 07:13.233
or should I do that too?

07:13.266 --> 07:14.635
Well let's see,
I got a vacation

07:14.668 --> 07:16.436
coming up in about six months.

07:16.470 --> 07:19.907
Fine fine, I'll do it.

07:19.940 --> 07:22.142
You know, Dan, there is
just nothing I would rather

07:22.175 --> 07:23.911
do right now than to
stay here and argue

07:23.944 --> 07:24.978
back and forth with you.

07:25.012 --> 07:27.280
But unfortunately, I
have to go to work,

07:27.314 --> 07:29.783
because that's all
I ever do is work.

07:29.817 --> 07:31.685
So I'll see all you
lovely people later

07:31.719 --> 07:33.654
when I get home from work.

07:36.957 --> 07:38.492
That's a nice try,
Rosanne, but guilting

07:38.526 --> 07:41.695
me isn't going to work.

07:41.729 --> 07:44.532
[music playing]

07:50.003 --> 07:51.939
Hey.

07:51.972 --> 07:54.107
Hey, you guys.

07:54.141 --> 07:55.442
Hey.

07:55.475 --> 07:58.211
Hey, Fred and Ginger,
there's no dancing in here.

07:58.245 --> 07:59.346
We ain't dancing.

07:59.379 --> 08:00.981
We're cooking.

08:01.014 --> 08:02.415
Well, turn off the stove.

08:02.449 --> 08:06.086
We don't have a cabaret license.

08:06.119 --> 08:07.354
Hey.

08:07.387 --> 08:10.758
That's the third time you
guys bumped into me, pal.

08:10.791 --> 08:13.160
You want to do
something about it?

08:13.193 --> 08:14.227
You think I'm
afraid to hit her?

08:17.798 --> 08:19.767
Knock it off.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.034
I ain't messing around, Rosie.

08:21.068 --> 08:22.469
I'll flatten that broad.

08:22.502 --> 08:24.371
Sit down and shut up.

08:27.407 --> 08:29.342
Hey, honey, I need you
to get him out of here.

08:29.376 --> 08:30.243
Who are you?

08:30.277 --> 08:31.378
My mother?

08:31.411 --> 08:33.413
Well, it could be, the
'60s were such a blur.

08:36.316 --> 08:37.951
Rosie, you need help with her?

08:37.985 --> 08:38.786
Sit.

08:41.889 --> 08:42.823
Sorry Joe.

08:42.856 --> 08:45.926
Hey, it come
with the territory.

08:45.959 --> 08:47.661
You know, I once
killed a guy in Korea

08:47.695 --> 08:50.631
just by pressing on his throat.

08:50.664 --> 08:53.000
Uh, huh.

08:53.033 --> 08:56.469
You want to come home
with me tonight, Rosie?

08:56.503 --> 08:58.138
Well that's a
wonderful offer, Joe.

08:58.171 --> 09:01.508
But I'm a married woman,
not a happily married woman,

09:01.541 --> 09:03.310
but a married woman nonetheless.

09:03.343 --> 09:07.615
Are we playing
strip poker or what?

09:07.648 --> 09:11.018
All right, that's
it, twinkle toes.

09:11.051 --> 09:13.453
I'm sick and tired of you and
your hussy bumping into me.

09:13.486 --> 09:14.888
I'm getting really
tired of your mouth.

09:14.922 --> 09:15.923
Oh, yeah?

09:15.956 --> 09:17.524
Hey, you guys would
take that outside?

09:17.557 --> 09:18.491
You want to make us?

09:22.495 --> 09:24.932
Oh, great, bring him into it.

09:24.965 --> 09:26.634
You're even dumber
than you look.

09:26.667 --> 09:27.567
Who you calling dumb?

09:27.601 --> 09:28.468
I'm calling you dumb.

09:28.501 --> 09:29.536
Hey, hey hey, hey.
Come on.

09:29.569 --> 09:30.437
Come on.

09:30.470 --> 09:31.404
Come on, guys.

09:31.438 --> 09:32.372
Come on now.

09:36.509 --> 09:38.445
Hey, what's going on?

09:38.478 --> 09:39.913
Oh, nothing much.

09:39.947 --> 09:44.818
Just two guys trying
kill each other there.

09:44.852 --> 09:45.953
Come on, guys, break it up.

09:45.986 --> 09:46.854
Hey.

09:46.887 --> 09:48.055
I got it, Sarge.

09:48.088 --> 09:50.157
Hey.
- Break it up.

09:50.190 --> 09:51.424
Break it up.

09:51.458 --> 09:53.861
Back it up.

09:53.894 --> 09:56.429
Get it outside.

09:56.463 --> 09:58.966
Hey, Rosie, do you think
your sister might like

09:58.999 --> 10:02.670
to come on with me tonight?

10:02.703 --> 10:05.472
[music playing]

10:11.078 --> 10:12.345
What's the longest
you and Helen have

10:12.379 --> 10:14.782
ever gone without having sex?

10:14.815 --> 10:18.351
You mean with each other?

10:18.385 --> 10:22.422
Come on, man, I'm serious.

10:22.455 --> 10:24.191
The year we had Paulie.

10:24.224 --> 10:25.625
We were most of
the hockey season,

10:25.659 --> 10:27.895
right up to the Stanley Cup.

10:27.928 --> 10:28.796
Why?

10:28.829 --> 10:30.497
I don't know.

10:30.530 --> 10:34.868
Oh, you have enough problems
in the boo-di-air department?

10:37.771 --> 10:40.340
If you mean the boudoir
department, I guess.

10:40.373 --> 10:42.175
Not major, but I guess.

10:42.209 --> 10:44.544
You know, she's working a lot.

10:44.577 --> 10:46.446
I'm working a lot.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.048
Uh, Dan, you're not
rinsing them right.

10:48.081 --> 10:49.582
You'll get a spot if you
don't rinse them right.

10:52.753 --> 10:54.054
You know for someone
who is supposed

10:54.087 --> 10:56.256
to be the king of his castle,
you sure know an awful lot

10:56.289 --> 10:57.324
about washing dishes.

10:57.357 --> 11:00.427
Oh, I'm always
watching Helen do it.

11:00.460 --> 11:01.962
You don't think
I'd touch a dish.

11:01.995 --> 11:02.863
Only with your tongue.

11:05.699 --> 11:08.736
All right, Danny, I'll
tell you what to do.

11:08.769 --> 11:10.838
You set the alarm clock for
4 o'clock in the morning.

11:10.871 --> 11:12.773
You wake here up.

11:12.806 --> 11:17.277
You put on a little
Julio Englinglase music.

11:17.310 --> 11:22.215
And you treat her to a
moonlight tango in the buff.

11:26.987 --> 11:28.756
Andy, I'm trying
to talk to you here.

11:28.789 --> 11:29.689
What?
What?

11:29.723 --> 11:31.491
She doesn't like
it in the morning?

11:31.524 --> 11:34.094
Andy, she gets off of
work at 2:30 in the morning.

11:34.127 --> 11:35.695
I'm supposed to
wake her up at 4:00

11:35.729 --> 11:38.431
and say, roll over and cha-cha?

11:38.465 --> 11:40.901
Buddy, buddy, pal, the
worst thing you can do

11:40.934 --> 11:42.469
is think about it.

11:42.502 --> 11:44.504
The more you think about it,
the more pressure you feel.

11:44.537 --> 11:48.141
The more pressure you feel,
the less spontaneous you feel.

11:48.175 --> 11:51.678
And if you ain't spontaneous,
how you going to be romantic?

11:51.711 --> 11:54.281
So tell me, how bad is it?

11:54.314 --> 11:55.582
Let me put it this way.

11:55.615 --> 11:57.350
I'm having problems in
the boo-di-air department,

11:57.384 --> 12:00.120
and I'm discussing it with you.

12:00.153 --> 12:02.455
[music playing]

12:08.328 --> 12:10.497
You look pretty
sharp back there, sis.

12:10.530 --> 12:12.900
You got any idea
what you're doing?

12:12.933 --> 12:14.201
Not a clue.

12:14.234 --> 12:18.638
But that's me lately, lost.

12:18.671 --> 12:22.475
Lost in the fog that
has become my life.

12:22.509 --> 12:25.946
The ungraspable cloud
that is my existence.

12:25.979 --> 12:27.114
You all right?

12:27.147 --> 12:28.015
Yeah.

12:28.048 --> 12:29.249
I'm fine.

12:29.282 --> 12:31.651
What's the
ungraspable cloud stuff?

12:31.684 --> 12:32.920
Nothing.

12:32.953 --> 12:35.288
You want to stick
around for a while?

12:35.322 --> 12:36.623
You want me to?

12:36.656 --> 12:37.724
If you want to.

12:37.757 --> 12:39.993
I want to know
what's wrong, Roseanne.

12:40.027 --> 12:41.361
I'm a cop.

12:41.394 --> 12:45.365
And withholding information is--

12:45.398 --> 12:46.466
you know-- is--

12:46.499 --> 12:47.300
is bad.

12:49.702 --> 12:53.040
Dan's been working a
lot more this winter.

12:53.073 --> 12:54.507
Well, that's good, isn't it?

12:54.541 --> 12:55.708
Yeah.

12:55.742 --> 13:01.314
Well, like he's got this
really big job at this Red

13:01.348 --> 13:02.715
Velvet Massage Parlor.

13:02.749 --> 13:04.885
You can imagine
what that's like.

13:04.918 --> 13:06.586
Oh, have you seen the
women who work down there?

13:06.619 --> 13:09.122
They walk around in these
see through body stockings

13:09.156 --> 13:11.859
and tacky little high heels.

13:11.892 --> 13:13.626
You're making me
feel a lot better.

13:13.660 --> 13:16.063
I'm kidding.

13:16.096 --> 13:17.064
I know.

13:17.097 --> 13:18.999
I know.

13:19.032 --> 13:22.535
But-- uh-- Dan, you know,
he's just been under a lot

13:22.569 --> 13:23.736
of pressure lately, you know.

13:23.770 --> 13:26.506
He-- he's like picking
at me for the little,

13:26.539 --> 13:29.977
tiniest things, which is-- we--

13:30.010 --> 13:32.645
we got like no time together.

13:32.679 --> 13:33.813
You know what I mean?

13:33.847 --> 13:35.682
Well, you're both
working long hours.

13:35.715 --> 13:37.384
You're bound to get cranky.

13:37.417 --> 13:42.189
Yeah, and it's
having an effect on us.

13:42.222 --> 13:43.223
Sure, he gets cranky.

13:43.256 --> 13:44.724
You get crankier.

13:44.757 --> 13:46.960
We're not having sex.

13:46.994 --> 13:47.928
No.

13:47.961 --> 13:49.396
Yes.

13:49.429 --> 13:52.332
- How long has it been?
- What month is this?

13:56.669 --> 14:00.140
Have you tried
setting the alarm

14:00.173 --> 14:07.114
for like 4:00 in the morning,
put on a little James Brown?

14:07.147 --> 14:08.181
You got to be kidding me.

14:08.215 --> 14:10.450
Well, what's more
important, sex or sleep?

14:10.483 --> 14:13.353
Well, I'm too tired to
answer that right now.

14:13.386 --> 14:16.589
I just think Dan, he doesn't
like me anymore, you know.

14:16.623 --> 14:17.490
I'm--

14:17.524 --> 14:18.391
Oh--

14:18.425 --> 14:21.161
It's like I'm not-- you know--

14:21.194 --> 14:22.795
I'm not turning him on.

14:22.829 --> 14:26.299
Roseanne, Dan loves you.

14:26.333 --> 14:27.200
I don't know.

14:27.234 --> 14:28.435
It's just something's wrong.

14:28.468 --> 14:30.237
It's like I'm so
doing something wrong.

14:30.270 --> 14:33.273
It's like he doesn't even
want to like-- he doesn't

14:33.306 --> 14:34.874
even want to kiss me any more.

14:34.908 --> 14:36.643
Wait a second, how
come you automatically

14:36.676 --> 14:39.046
think it's your fault?

14:39.079 --> 14:41.681
Because it is.

14:41.714 --> 14:43.483
Well, have you even
talked to him about it?

14:43.516 --> 14:44.551
No.

14:44.584 --> 14:45.785
And don't you say
nothing to him either

14:45.818 --> 14:47.254
because you know how
he gets if I go telling

14:47.287 --> 14:48.821
you all this personal stuff.

14:48.855 --> 14:51.658
Yeah right, like I'm
going to go talk to Dan

14:51.691 --> 14:54.962
about your guy's sex life.

14:54.995 --> 14:57.430
She thinks you don't
like her anymore.

14:57.464 --> 14:58.365
Jackie--

14:58.398 --> 14:59.933
Now, you think
what's between you

14:59.967 --> 15:01.601
and my sister is
none of my business,

15:01.634 --> 15:05.338
but if it wasn't for me, she
never would have married you.

15:05.372 --> 15:06.273
What did she tell you?

15:06.306 --> 15:07.707
She didn't tell me anything.

15:07.740 --> 15:12.946
It's just that she's my
sister and I know her.

15:12.980 --> 15:15.515
Why would she think I
don't like her any more?

15:15.548 --> 15:16.783
I don't know.

15:16.816 --> 15:18.551
That's what I'm trying--
now, I'm just tossing things

15:18.585 --> 15:19.852
off the top of my head here.

15:19.886 --> 15:22.855
But could it be that you're
not making love to her?

15:22.889 --> 15:24.324
No, it could not be that.

15:24.357 --> 15:27.794
Because I can only say
that, speaking as a woman,

15:27.827 --> 15:31.864
nothing hurts worse than
thinking that the man you love

15:31.898 --> 15:34.001
isn't hot for you anymore.

15:34.034 --> 15:35.668
Dan, I don't want--

15:35.702 --> 15:38.305
I don't I don't
want to brag, but I

15:38.338 --> 15:44.744
have been rejected by men in
many, many, many, many, many

15:44.777 --> 15:46.980
ways.

15:47.014 --> 15:52.485
But cutting off the
love supply is by far

15:52.519 --> 15:54.954
the cruelest rejection of all.

15:54.988 --> 15:59.326
I didn't cut off
the love supply.

15:59.359 --> 16:00.827
She cut me off.

16:00.860 --> 16:04.297
Uh-- bottom line
is it's laundry

16:04.331 --> 16:08.968
day and I don't see us throwing
any sheets in the machine.

16:09.002 --> 16:11.638
Jackie, I appreciate
your concern, but we can--

16:11.671 --> 16:12.772
we can take care of it.

16:12.805 --> 16:14.241
Thank you very much.

16:14.274 --> 16:16.343
As you can see, I've got a
lot of laundry to do here.

16:16.376 --> 16:18.045
Well, before you
worry about cleaning up

16:18.078 --> 16:19.512
the rest of the
house, I'd straighten

16:19.546 --> 16:20.980
things out in the bedroom.

16:21.014 --> 16:23.183
Jackie, I get a
lot of work to do.

16:23.216 --> 16:26.953
Dan, she thinks you
don't find her attractive.

16:26.986 --> 16:28.621
And she's blaming herself.

16:44.604 --> 16:46.173
Can you watch
the kids for them?

16:46.206 --> 16:48.275
Can you put that on warm cold?

16:52.545 --> 16:54.414
Yeah, you're right, maybe
I will move to Boston.

17:02.922 --> 17:05.792
[music playing]

17:09.929 --> 17:11.098
Hey.

17:11.131 --> 17:12.632
Hey, Rosie, get the lady
a white Russian, please.

17:12.665 --> 17:13.700
Sure.

17:13.733 --> 17:16.403
Can I get a beer
when you get a chance.

17:16.436 --> 17:17.337
My name is Tony.

17:17.370 --> 17:19.906
I'm in no hurry.
- Do you have ID?

17:23.143 --> 17:24.444
I think I left it
out by my Harley.

17:24.477 --> 17:26.146
I can get it if you want.

17:26.179 --> 17:27.013
Quick.

17:27.046 --> 17:28.848
What year were you born?

17:28.881 --> 17:30.817
Ah, '68.

17:30.850 --> 17:33.386
OK, you'll pass.

17:33.420 --> 17:36.189
Nice place you got here.

17:36.223 --> 17:37.524
Tony, huh?

17:37.557 --> 17:39.792
Well, actually, it's Anthony.

17:39.826 --> 17:41.828
But the guys that owe
me money, call me Tony.

17:49.836 --> 17:52.872
Mind if I ask your name?

17:52.905 --> 17:53.706
It's Amelia.

17:56.576 --> 17:58.211
Amelia?

17:58.245 --> 18:00.413
That's a very pretty name.

18:00.447 --> 18:02.582
It's Millie for short.

18:02.615 --> 18:04.317
Millie, that's
nice, that's nice too.

18:07.420 --> 18:10.590
This is nice town, Millie.

18:10.623 --> 18:14.794
Yeah, it kind of grows on
you, you know, like mold.

18:14.827 --> 18:15.828
I like it here.

18:15.862 --> 18:18.097
You're not from here?

18:18.131 --> 18:20.933
Actually, this is my
first time in the area.

18:20.967 --> 18:22.369
What do you do?

18:22.402 --> 18:25.338
A little bit of everything.

18:25.372 --> 18:27.840
Oh, one of those
international banker,

18:27.874 --> 18:33.413
neurosurgeon, test pilot,
cowboy kind of guys, huh?

18:33.446 --> 18:34.347
Basically.

18:38.318 --> 18:44.457
You're out kind of
late for a working man.

18:44.491 --> 18:47.760
Well, when you want something,
you gotta make sacrifices.

18:51.298 --> 18:52.098
You going to stay long?

18:56.736 --> 18:58.738
Well, I was thinking
about hitting the road soon.

18:58.771 --> 19:01.374
But I might be changing my mind.

19:04.211 --> 19:06.446
Changing my ways.

19:06.479 --> 19:08.781
Changing my style.

19:08.815 --> 19:11.751
Changing my life.

19:11.784 --> 19:12.619
Changing your shorts.

19:19.158 --> 19:21.127
You got a nice smile.

19:21.160 --> 19:22.929
And you have the
warmest, most beautiful

19:22.962 --> 19:26.399
eyes I've ever seen in my life.

19:26.433 --> 19:27.400
Really?

19:27.434 --> 19:33.640
You know how when
you meet somebody

19:33.673 --> 19:36.743
suddenly feel very close
to them as if you've

19:36.776 --> 19:39.479
known them your whole?

19:39.512 --> 19:40.947
Yeah.

19:40.980 --> 19:43.683
You believe in
love at first sight?

19:43.716 --> 19:44.584
Yeah.

19:44.617 --> 19:48.388
That ever happen to you?

19:48.421 --> 19:49.622
No, but I'm only 20.

19:54.093 --> 19:55.127
Ever happen to you?

19:55.161 --> 19:56.229
Yeah.

19:56.263 --> 19:57.564
When?

19:57.597 --> 19:59.899
About three minutes ago.

19:59.932 --> 20:01.200
You flirting with me?

20:01.234 --> 20:03.803
I'm trying.

20:03.836 --> 20:04.704
Well, keep going.

20:07.640 --> 20:09.108
What time you get off of work?

20:09.141 --> 20:10.410
Bars closes at 2:00.

20:13.246 --> 20:15.214
Scram, Joe.

20:15.248 --> 20:16.683
I thought you said
you was married.

20:19.452 --> 20:20.787
I am married.

20:23.723 --> 20:24.824
I love you, Roseanne.

20:24.857 --> 20:26.326
I love you, too, Dan.

20:26.359 --> 20:29.262
I want to be with you.

20:29.296 --> 20:30.430
Hold that thought.

20:37.970 --> 20:39.439
You're on your own, Lizzie.

20:48.848 --> 20:50.783
I need to be with you.

20:50.817 --> 20:51.784
Are we parked close?

20:51.818 --> 20:52.785
We're close.

20:52.819 --> 20:53.620
Good.

20:57.256 --> 21:00.126
[music playing]

21:37.597 --> 21:41.033
Do you want to
come home with me?

21:41.067 --> 21:43.002
Give me a break.
