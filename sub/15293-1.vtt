01:38.080 --> 01:41.197
It's time to pay the rent.

01:43.240 --> 01:45.470
The rent to be paid!

01:49.080 --> 01:51.435
The phallic symbols of good. -What?

02:33.880 --> 02:37.714
Alyce gutter company.

02:43.880 --> 02:47.395
I will stop by after work. I had to escape.

02:47.560 --> 02:51.838
You think you are so sweet. Not true?

02:51.960 --> 02:55.350
I think not.

03:21.120 --> 03:23.873
Okay. What about the ...

03:24.000 --> 03:30.473
... "Pirates of the Caribbean: the curse of the Black Jack?"

03:30.600 --> 03:33.831
"V is for vagina." Of course. Oh, so.

03:33.960 --> 03:39.592
How "fun with Dick and Vagina"?

03:39.720 --> 03:42.518
Okay. "Red pussy hunting."

03:42.640 --> 03:45.154
It seemed a bit unnecessary.

03:45.280 --> 03:48.397
-where are we going? -somewhere?

03:48.520 --> 03:51.114
I do not think that we are heading for the kesuatu site.

03:53.040 --> 03:57.431
We're stuck!

04:02.160 --> 04:05.596
It actually feels as if we're stuck.

04:05.720 --> 04:10.953
-I have a career. -No, you have a job.

04:11.080 --> 04:14.390
you have a job that sucks.

04:14.520 --> 04:17.829
jerk, A job that sucks your trust.

04:17.959 --> 04:21.635
Okay. But pay the rent?

04:21.760 --> 04:24.832
Really?

04:24.960 --> 04:28.509
I almost paid the rent. Where are we going?

04:28.640 --> 04:31.598
-where no where! -I'm serious!

04:31.720 --> 04:34.314
where I should go?

04:34.440 --> 04:37.830
-To Echo, of course! -Why is "of course"?

04:37.960 --> 04:42.112
Oh Lord. Do you know what I want now?

04:42.240 --> 04:46.472
Yes! O Lord! Red Velvet Cake.

-I'll call. -You can be half the price.

05:29.120 --> 05:32.317
-She can bring you under his handling. -During his cave man eyebrows.

05:32.440 --> 05:37.514
We have to give mu a rich man so you can get rid of the work jelekmu.

05:37.640 --> 05:41.679
-So not bad. -True isn't it? the customers you have?

05:41.800 --> 05:45.679
Enron? The tobacco industry? Hitler? The mafia?

05:45.800 --> 05:49.554
-The Mafia would be a step forward. -Karma you really bad.

05:49.680 --> 05:53.559
Okay, hippie. This is only temporary.

05:54.960 --> 05:57.872
-Hey! -Hello.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.515
Spinster.

There Is Mike. Come. Hi, Mike. Where's Vince?

06:10.560 --> 06:13.120
-He is near here. -Where is it?

06:13.240 --> 06:16.232
I do not know. I'm not a GPS.

06:16.360 --> 06:20.239
Sometimes you're a bastard.

06:21.880 --> 06:24.758
Hey, bitch.

06:28.480 --> 06:34.237
Cold bitch. He's really cool.

06:59.840 --> 07:03.150
What do you want? Whiskey or ...

07:03.280 --> 07:06.317
-Would you like mescal? We take the mescal. -Okay.

07:06.440 --> 07:09.398
Hey. Two mescal, thank you.

07:11.120 --> 07:14.749
To be honest? The same ringtone?

07:14.880 --> 07:18.156
Vincey, dear! My love. Where are you?

07:18.280 --> 07:20.840
What is it? Yes!

07:25.200 --> 07:28.875
Are you sure you don't want the card, dear?

07:29.000 --> 07:32.356

07:32.480 --> 07:35.040
I was wrong. I'm sorry.

07:39.320 --> 07:43.950
Drink me! Drink me! Drink me!

07:52.000 --> 07:55.276
-Hey, Al. How are you? -Thank you.

07:55.400 --> 07:59.757

07:59.880 --> 08:04.271
And you know how I get, when I get the Red Velvet Cake.

08:04.400 --> 08:07.312
Okay, you guys might be able to continue?

08:07.440 --> 08:11.831
-No, fuck. Why? -I promise I'll talk to Mike.

08:11.960 --> 08:17.512
-Come on. I know Mike. -Yes. Mike is an asshole.

08:19.480 --> 08:23.439
-What, asshole? -I have to be with a woman.

08:23.560 --> 08:27.314
I have to give them a couple of hours. I have a quota.

08:27.440 --> 08:33.629
-There is nothing wrong with it. -Who? Al? No, he's fine.

08:33.760 --> 08:36.832
Naughty girl.

08:38.159 --> 08:40.720
What happened?

08:47.360 --> 08:49.999
-What happened? -Damn, Damn ...

08:50.120 --> 08:53.476
-You Bastard! -Quiet!

08:53.600 --> 08:56.592
The hell with it! Let me go, Mike!

08:56.720 --> 08:59.712
both of you assholes!

08:59.840 --> 09:03.719
Former crazy. now what, stupid.

09:03.840 --> 09:07.116
-you fucking ...-come on, bitch.

09:07.240 --> 09:11.028
-Cursed be whores! -Okay. Okay.

09:11.160 --> 09:14.470
Don't give them the pleasure.

09:22.720 --> 09:28.989
I have to say, "I will do everything to get it back, Vince."

09:29.120 --> 09:33.796
I was going to lose his pants to his knees,

09:33.920 --> 09:39.040
- ... And cut it! -Too cliche.

09:39.160 --> 09:44.712
-I'm serious. -No, Vince is not feasible.

09:44.840 --> 09:49.197
You're too good for him. This is you. you did nothing wrong.

09:49.320 --> 09:54.792
you have to be honest, and have an open heart.

09:54.920 --> 10:00.790
I love you, Carroll. you don't have to blame.

10:02.440 --> 10:06.956
-But what about the engine chip? -What you get is better here?

10:07.080 --> 10:11.392
Yes, I do! Kill Vince again.

10:12.840 --> 10:18.153
I could have stabbed her to death. It is true.

10:18.280 --> 10:22.796
Then I can see it in death, while the life go out of him.

10:22.920 --> 10:27.038
Jeez! Where it came from? years in prison?

10:27.160 --> 10:30.789
You can make your own knife.

10:30.920 --> 10:36.119
I see in the news how a woman have been arrested in the kitchen.

10:36.240 --> 10:40.074
The man was locked in a sort of ... as kamung.

10:40.200 --> 10:44.318
So he holds the stomach into a pan fried,

10:44.440 --> 10:48.035
Then he had to cook it

10:48.160 --> 10:52.517
One day he drew him up to the bar.

10:52.640 --> 10:55.234
Then he pushed directly into her stomach.

10:55.360 --> 10:58.875
The caption reads: "Rip with improvised knives".

10:59.000 --> 11:01.992
How I did it.

11:03.840 --> 11:06.877
Who control now, bitch?

11:13.480 --> 11:16.552
Let lay. I want to lie down.

11:16.680 --> 11:19.513
I want to lie down!

11:19.640 --> 11:23.679
I want to be amazing you. Vince ...

11:23.800 --> 11:27.839
In the here and now.

11:27.960 --> 11:31.350
Come. We have to do it.

11:31.480 --> 11:37.919
This will make it scared half to death and give a little bit "morality".

11:38.040 --> 11:41.715
And then we can take the urethra and give a "maturity".

11:41.840 --> 11:45.469
All in the game of lesbian sex.

11:45.600 --> 11:49.991
"My best friend's Vagina." "Get into the vagina."

11:50.400 --> 11:54.871
-Don't piss in her pussy! Irritated vagina-is it?

11:56.200 --> 11:59.476
So you want me to give you Vince?

11:59.600 --> 12:02.717
Yes. We of course will not be falling in love-

12:02.840 --> 12:05.912
-And start to see the "Ellen" with my hand in celanamu.

12:06.040 --> 12:10.830
-"Once in her pussy"-I feel exploited.

12:10.960 --> 12:14.714
Let's go!

12:21.040 --> 12:23.998
Do you think that?

12:41.760 --> 12:44.877
O Lord! I want to puke!

12:55.760 --> 12:59.878
Red Velvet Cake a dammit.

13:02.240 --> 13:07.394
-Are you okay? -Very. How are you?

13:07.520 --> 13:11.069
I don't understand, she nasty Renee.

13:11.200 --> 13:15.318
Slut. What's wrong with them?

13:19.200 --> 13:23.398
Is it he who fell asleep at the cake Debs?

13:23.520 --> 13:25.954
No, this Dinah.

13:26.080 --> 13:31.108
Renee asleep at the heater, so there is a fire in her hair.

13:31.240 --> 13:34.869
-Super! -My apartment smells like a cat on fire.

13:35.000 --> 13:39.994
-It was very disgusting. -you mean "sovereign."

13:41.560 --> 13:46.634
-What happened to us? -What do you mean by "we"?

13:46.760 --> 13:49.991
-I think the groups. -What happened to you?

13:50.120 --> 13:53.908
o who disappeared for a year.

13:54.040 --> 13:58.033
-I've probably lived in the cavity. -In a rabbit hole?

13:58.160 --> 14:04.110
Come back to us. Return to the living world.

14:04.240 --> 14:09.030
-It's a little embarrassing. -Shameful?

14:09.160 --> 14:13.392
It's a pain. You're scaring me.

14:13.520 --> 14:17.672
you called me "a single girl trying".

14:17.800 --> 14:23.193
You menyalinku in all things. I'm sorry, but it's really weird.

14:23.320 --> 14:27.074
Why all this?

14:27.200 --> 14:31.159
-And what happened to the ring tone? -Only ringtones.

14:31.280 --> 14:36.718
I will not discuss it. We should see a doctor cuts tonight.

14:36.840 --> 14:39.718
Gap We all have to do.

14:39.840 --> 14:45.517
You know what? We should have a party reunion.

14:45.640 --> 14:48.154
We could invite Renee.

14:48.280 --> 14:52.831
- ... And set it on fire. -Yes!

14:56.520 --> 15:00.513
Super. Come on, let's go.

15:00.640 --> 15:05.316
-I need something stronger. -What? Like what?

15:05.440 --> 15:09.752
-I don't know. Possibly heroin. -It's a fantastic idea, Carroll.

15:09.880 --> 15:15.352
-I could use the drugs. -Oh my God. It's very ' 80s.

15:15.480 --> 15:19.268
I knew the vision of a man.

15:19.400 --> 15:23.359
I use to buy T of him. He is not safe.

15:23.480 --> 15:29.919
In the absence of Putaw and heroin ...

15:32.520 --> 15:36.752
... I think we should do it.

15:38.440 --> 15:41.716
Stay here and don't talk to anyone.

15:41.840 --> 15:45.310
She's weird with new header so stay here.

15:47.720 --> 15:51.235
Rex. Do you have anything?

15:55.600 --> 15:58.512
Come on. Let him be.

16:05.040 --> 16:09.591
Destination! Let's go from here.

16:11.080 --> 16:13.799
Foster, Rex!

16:31.920 --> 16:36.391
-Wait, wait! Cramps. -Yes!

16:46.560 --> 16:50.473
-It feels so wonderful. -It is so beautiful.

16:50.600 --> 16:54.593
This is because the sexy Rexy ...

16:54.720 --> 16:58.759
Selling drugs ... the quality of the Hustler.

16:58.880 --> 17:03.192
But he's part of the demons, living and gone if he didn't like you.

17:03.320 --> 17:06.153
And if she likes me?

17:06.280 --> 17:10.397
If he likes you ... run!

17:19.640 --> 17:22.871
I love you.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.877
-Are you? I love you! -I love you.

17:26.000 --> 17:29.629
Oh Lord. Cuddle me.

17:29.760 --> 17:35.118
I love you so much.

17:35.240 --> 17:40.109
-you are my best friend. -I'm probably the only one your friend.

17:42.880 --> 17:48.238
-Pain! -But I love you!

17:48.360 --> 17:52.558
And I love the bangunanmu! This is very good.

17:52.680 --> 17:55.797
This looks nice. This red.

18:01.280 --> 18:04.431
I want to see it.

18:07.160 --> 18:10.152
Can we go there? I want to be there.

18:10.280 --> 18:13.272
I know how to get there.

18:13.400 --> 18:17.518
-Do you? -Yes. We go there.

18:20.760 --> 18:23.718
O Lord!

18:23.840 --> 18:26.229
This is very beautiful.

18:26.360 --> 18:30.353
I was the King of the world!

18:30.480 --> 18:33.597
This is the best movie ever made.

18:33.720 --> 18:37.952
-I hate that movie! -How do you hate?

18:38.080 --> 18:41.914
you are on the E! you don't have to hate something!

18:42.040 --> 18:45.510
I hate that movie!

18:45.640 --> 18:48.029
You know what? Ah, it's not nothing.

18:48.160 --> 18:51.835
See your own store, tax. So I took.

18:51.960 --> 18:54.520
Oh Lord.

18:54.640 --> 18:58.155
far below.

18:58.280 --> 19:03.070
For the devil! O Lord! Something flew past my ear!

19:03.200 --> 19:06.237
-Gosh! -What is it?

19:06.360 --> 19:11.195
-It was a bat. -Silent! It's not.

19:11.320 --> 19:14.790
-There are bats here. -Not!

19:14.920 --> 19:20.870
-There are no bats are here! -Yes, they stay there.

19:21.000 --> 19:24.151
Bad luck! This is not funny!

19:24.280 --> 19:27.909
-you're afraid of bats! -Yes.

19:28.040 --> 19:33.592
Of course I'm afraid of them. Carriers of herpes and rabies.

19:33.720 --> 19:36.837
We should buy a cat.

19:36.960 --> 19:41.590
-Cats eat bats. -No, they don't.

19:41.720 --> 19:45.395
Cats eat bats! Cats eat bats!

19:45.520 --> 19:50.071
you sound like a crazy kids book authors.

19:50.200 --> 19:54.079
-They eat birds. -This is something else.

19:54.200 --> 20:00.355
No matter that we have to continue. Now I'm here.

20:00.480 --> 20:03.916
I can fly. View.

20:06.760 --> 20:10.594
-Shit! -I couldn't resist.

20:10.720 --> 20:15.157
Now I'm on the outside. He's mad because I called him ...

20:15.280 --> 20:19.592
wet ... pussy. Lonely young vagina.

20:19.720 --> 20:22.951
Someone is mad at me.

20:23.080 --> 20:28.598
They call me vagina wet.

20:28.720 --> 20:32.315
They call me vagina wet.

20:32.440 --> 20:35.955
A wet Pussy. A wet Pussy.

20:41.600 --> 20:44.034
Oh Lord.

20:50.200 --> 20:52.475
Carroll?

21:07.320 --> 21:12.997
-What happened? -Damn! Call the police!

21:13.120 --> 21:15.475
Wait a minute! Stop!

21:23.720 --> 21:27.952
-Damn! -Oh My God!

21:29.640 --> 21:34.760
-Oh My God! -A Girl.

22:11.160 --> 22:13.549
The hell with it! Jerk ...

22:24.240 --> 22:28.233
What did you do? What did you do?

23:53.120 --> 23:55.953
Alyce ...

23:58.320 --> 24:00.914
Alyce ...

24:09.600 --> 24:11.556
Alyce!

24:30.760 --> 24:34.435
This is the police. May I ask some questions?

24:58.600 --> 25:00.750
Hello?

25:02.720 --> 25:06.633
This is the police. May I ask some questions?

25:08.360 --> 25:12.558
-Can you wait a minute? -Okay.

25:14.440 --> 25:16.795
The hell with it!

25:40.640 --> 25:44.155
A young woman came out of the crash yesterday-

25:44.280 --> 25:47.431
-Out there. We tried to identify himself.

25:47.560 --> 25:50.757
Oh Lord. What happened?

25:50.880 --> 25:55.590
It looks like he jumped off the roof.

25:55.720 --> 26:01.113
Oh Lord. I would like to know whether it's Carroll.

26:01.240 --> 26:04.471
My friend went there last night.

26:04.600 --> 26:08.309
-What is the last name Caroll? -Lewis.

26:08.440 --> 26:11.671
He had just been told that her boyfriend cheated on her.

26:11.800 --> 26:14.519
And you?

26:15.920 --> 26:19.879
I ... I'm sorry. I was simply ...

26:20.000 --> 26:26.235
I'm going to bed. This is really difficult.

26:26.360 --> 26:30.148
-Can see some identification? -My name is Alyce.

26:30.280 --> 26:33.511
I still want to see identity.

26:33.640 --> 26:36.234
Of course. Wait a minute.

27:03.400 --> 27:07.188
-He left something here? -No

27:07.320 --> 27:10.915
-Is she drunk? -We drink a little wine.

27:11.040 --> 27:15.989
-How many? -We share a bottle.

27:16.120 --> 27:18.873
Drugs?

27:21.400 --> 27:24.676
-Did you go to the roof with it. -No

27:24.800 --> 27:31.592
It is not. He was alone. She said that she wanted to be alone.

27:31.720 --> 27:37.033
-Is he angry? She cries? -Yes.

27:37.160 --> 27:39.310
-Very? -Yes.

27:39.440 --> 27:42.398
But you let him walk alone to the top of the roof.

27:42.520 --> 27:48.834
-I don't know how bad it was. -But she is crying excessively. Very.

27:48.960 --> 27:54.193
Carroll often cry.

27:54.320 --> 27:59.314
He ... Vince can make or say something-

27:59.440 --> 28:03.718
-He was wounded so he came to me.

28:03.840 --> 28:06.912
So I tried to comfort her.

28:07.040 --> 28:10.430
But I was so tired tonight.

28:10.560 --> 28:13.757
I don't know what to do.

28:13.880 --> 28:16.440
-What is Vince her boyfriend? -Yes.

28:16.560 --> 28:21.588
-Did he beat him? -No, not like that.

28:21.720 --> 28:24.792
She was the ... He was a sweet person.

28:24.920 --> 28:29.630
-Apart from the adultery? -Yes.

28:33.440 --> 28:36.477
All right. Thank you.

28:37.920 --> 28:41.549
How could Carroll committed suicide?

28:41.680 --> 28:44.752
He's not dead. But she looks broken.

28:44.880 --> 28:47.997
Now we can identify him.

28:48.120 --> 28:52.557
She could not identify. Facial damage makes it difficult to identify-

28:52.680 --> 28:57.037
Teeth are broken and we can't take the fingerprints.

28:57.160 --> 29:00.436
Who knows how long it takes.

29:00.560 --> 29:05.111
Sorry, but I'm not comfortable.

29:05.240 --> 29:10.439
-I have to pay it. -That's understandable.

29:10.560 --> 29:14.314
We provide sound, if we need more information.

29:14.440 --> 29:17.830
-Thank you. -Okay.

29:17.960 --> 29:24.479
Deputy Commissioner Warner Center. Victims can be identified.

29:46.280 --> 29:49.317
What's wrong with you?

29:49.440 --> 29:53.558
Okay. you have to make this.

29:53.680 --> 29:57.753
-They change too. -I know nothing.

29:57.880 --> 30:01.759
-It's called "estimated income". -Start values must be true ...

30:01.880 --> 30:05.998
... they change it or what?

30:06.120 --> 30:09.795
-If you say it, so ...-I need the value of the end. 17

30:09.920 --> 30:12.480
-Okay. -No more.

30:12.600 --> 30:15.558
So I have to keep an eye on.

30:19.480 --> 30:23.029
My best friend fell off the roof last night.

30:28.440 --> 30:30.431
Okay.

30:32.240 --> 30:35.277
I will return later.

30:53.080 --> 30:56.436
Hey.

31:02.360 --> 31:08.879
-How is she? -We are no longer in intensive care.

31:09.000 --> 31:15.030
They scanned her brain.

31:15.160 --> 31:18.311
We are still waiting for the results.

31:18.440 --> 31:23.468
This time, they didn't say anything.

31:23.600 --> 31:29.038
They will be taking samples more and see how later.

31:29.160 --> 31:33.199
They say that we should hope for the best. Fun.

31:33.320 --> 31:39.793
"Hope for the best." What else can we expect?

31:39.920 --> 31:43.913
-Did she say something? -He couldn't.

31:44.040 --> 31:49.398
The face was ruined and he's biting his tongue out.

31:49.520 --> 31:52.637
Why did he do this?

31:55.240 --> 31:58.471
-I don't know. -What is said before he went there?

31:58.600 --> 32:01.114
Does he say something?

32:04.920 --> 32:09.675
She said that she wanted to be alone.

32:11.440 --> 32:14.477
I wish I had gone with him there.

32:18.520 --> 32:22.832
-Carroll? -Carroll? Dear?

32:22.960 --> 32:25.872
O Lord! The nurse! The nurse!

32:26.000 --> 32:31.472
Carroll. No, stop. Carroll.

34:03.520 --> 34:06.830
Please sign in.

34:14.159 --> 34:16.879
Hey.

34:17.000 --> 34:22.552
-If the Mouse comes to the Board again? The same old songs.

34:22.679 --> 34:24.716
Yes?

34:24.840 --> 34:29.391
-you sold the E that night. -E? What is it?

34:29.520 --> 34:31.987
-What is it? -I don't know.

34:32.120 --> 34:35.873
Ecstasy. The drug.

34:36.000 --> 34:39.549
-Ecstasy? Drugs, Yes.

34:39.679 --> 34:43.559
-What do you want? -I want to buy ecstasy.

34:43.679 --> 34:46.148
-Do you have the funds? -What?

34:46.280 --> 34:50.637
The microphone. By law, I ask.

34:50.760 --> 34:55.356
-But I prefer to see. -This, she should be.

35:02.960 --> 35:05.235
-Okay? -No

35:05.360 --> 35:07.715
See it all.

35:07.840 --> 35:12.550
-In front of these people? -Yes.

35:16.680 --> 35:21.390
-If I get him, now? -No, dear. Pants.

35:27.400 --> 35:30.597
-Oh damn ...-Relax.

35:30.720 --> 35:35.157
Pull your pants again and remove the shoe.

35:35.280 --> 35:40.195
Roll the foot to the top so I can see you ankles. That's what I mean.

35:42.200 --> 35:45.033
-Turns you on? -I did.

35:45.160 --> 35:48.118
Can I buy the medicine now?

35:48.240 --> 35:52.199
Do you want a cure? Why the rush?

35:52.320 --> 35:55.437
Then we can avoid the law.

35:55.560 --> 35:59.519
-I don't mind. -Want a beer?

35:59.640 --> 36:04.919
-I don't want to drink beer. -I'm just trying to be a good host.

36:05.040 --> 36:08.635
This is not a pleasant visit.

36:08.760 --> 36:14.232
She looks do not know who we are. We hyggespredere.

36:14.360 --> 36:18.035
-What is the drug dealer. -No, we're much more than that.

36:18.160 --> 36:23.712
We are the masters of the new Church. Neoprimitivismens Explorers.

36:23.840 --> 36:29.119
That is, Yes. Our anti ... antietablisse ...

36:29.240 --> 36:32.630
-Anti-fucked. -We are the communicators!

36:32.760 --> 36:36.719
-We are the stikirenddrenge God! -And we have found the enemy.

36:36.840 --> 36:41.197
-And our enemies. -What is it?

36:41.320 --> 36:44.915
Who we are, the Mouse?

36:45.040 --> 36:48.271
Drug dealers?

36:48.400 --> 36:54.077
Okay, gentlemen. I will do business with that woman.

36:54.200 --> 36:56.634
"The shop."

37:01.040 --> 37:05.033
together with you, the Mouse! -Let's go.

37:07.560 --> 37:09.551
"The shop."

37:19.320 --> 37:22.551
I am shooting in the dark, and consider ...

37:22.680 --> 37:29.597
... I only contact you dirty narkoens in the world.

37:31.080 --> 37:35.631
With a new client, or beginner, I always try to build ...

37:35.760 --> 37:39.719
What are you saying? Do not believe. This will sound not reasonable in this industry.

37:39.840 --> 37:44.356
A kind of professionalism. I would take the legal risk-

37:44.480 --> 37:48.439
-When I try to fulfill your wishes.

37:48.560 --> 37:52.712
So I also need something from you, if we are to continue.

37:52.840 --> 37:56.674
-Let me guess ...-don't do it. I do not judge.

37:56.800 --> 38:00.156
Yet.

38:01.360 --> 38:06.832
-What you thought you could get it? -Give me some.

38:06.960 --> 38:10.714
Okay. Give me one.

38:10.840 --> 38:13.035
Come on! Carroll ...

38:13.160 --> 38:18.792
What I am talking about is the sort of customer relations.

38:18.920 --> 38:23.436
I have sinned and I must have something in return.

38:23.560 --> 38:30.511
you don't have enough money. But you have something that is priceless.

38:30.640 --> 38:34.474
-We can do business without money. -You're a fucking clichÃ©.

38:34.600 --> 38:38.388
Do you say that? Yes, this cast.

38:38.520 --> 38:43.230
But you come voluntarily. I am not forcing you.

38:43.360 --> 38:48.798
We don't even know each other but you get it with a little money.

38:48.920 --> 38:53.755
So it might be a little passed, that go beyond a cure.

38:53.920 --> 38:56.639
Do you dream of someone when you awake?

38:56.760 --> 39:01.390
Do you close your eyes and think that the dream is real?

39:01.520 --> 39:04.557
Close the eye you. take a chance.

39:04.680 --> 39:07.592
I provide all what you need.

39:07.720 --> 39:13.875
I want you to see the devil in the face and swallow them.

39:24.040 --> 39:28.397
you will be back. That I guarantee.

40:11.920 --> 40:15.276
I burn like a candle.

40:15.400 --> 40:18.153
I wonder how.

40:18.280 --> 40:23.991
How to flame out, when the light burned out?

40:38.080 --> 40:41.197
I love you.

40:43.280 --> 40:45.794
I love you.

41:01.760 --> 41:04.513
I love you.

41:10.880 --> 41:13.553
I love you.

43:00.560 --> 43:04.189
Who decides now, bitch?

43:24.400 --> 43:27.631
-No, no, you didn't even try. -What's wrong?

43:27.760 --> 43:31.116
Absent means automatic forfeiture penalty.

43:31.240 --> 43:35.438
-absence? -Where you yesterday?

43:35.560 --> 43:39.155
-Here. -No, it's not you.

43:39.280 --> 43:42.750
-Yes, I am. -Jackie?

43:45.720 --> 43:52.637
A little mistake to miss, and you are fired.

43:52.760 --> 43:58.676
I know that ye are sweet. But this time Clark could not even save you.

43:58.800 --> 44:02.839
Thank you, Danielle. you to let my mistakes-

44:02.960 --> 44:08.478
-And warned me about a very serious situation.

44:43.240 --> 44:45.754
Oh Yeah!

44:47.440 --> 44:49.829
Damn!

44:51.360 --> 44:54.830
-Girls ...-I said "don't be in the mouth"!

44:54.960 --> 44:58.191
What is the crime of the century?

44:58.320 --> 45:02.108
you get a little extra. Okay?

45:02.240 --> 45:05.312
Is it okay? Are we friends?

45:05.440 --> 45:09.228
Friends forever? -You fucking pig.

45:09.360 --> 45:13.239
What is it? Oink, Oink.

45:13.360 --> 45:18.878
-you are truly a real Prima Donna! -Fuck!

45:19.000 --> 45:22.037
Something powerful can relieve his anger ...

45:22.160 --> 45:25.835
- ... And sinful desires. -you don't know me.

45:25.960 --> 45:30.238
Let me guess? Apathy is sinful? Or it doesn't matter?

45:30.360 --> 45:34.194
I understand. I welcome it.

45:34.320 --> 45:37.790
But I'm cursed with immunity.

45:42.360 --> 45:46.194
-What is it? -This is my brother.

45:46.320 --> 45:50.757
I'm serious. I killed him.

45:50.880 --> 45:56.830
-To close, just nonsense. -No, this is indeed true.

45:56.960 --> 46:01.317
I was twelve years old. My brother is fifteen.

46:01.440 --> 46:05.399
We played with my father's gun.

46:05.520 --> 46:08.876
And I shot half his head.

46:09.000 --> 46:12.276
The mother heard it, and ran the approached us.

46:12.400 --> 46:18.509
He slipped into his brain mass and experience a hip fracture easily.

46:18.640 --> 46:22.349
I did not forget her voice, as long as I live.

46:22.480 --> 46:25.631
He couldn't bend because hips cracking.

46:25.760 --> 46:30.276
So at the time of the funeral, they should run him strapped to a stretcher.

46:30.400 --> 46:35.758
It stood like this, and it's great.

46:35.880 --> 46:39.270
He tied in so he couldn't move.

46:39.400 --> 46:45.077
Almost as expressionist works from before the war Germany.

46:45.200 --> 46:50.228
It's actually quite wild. This was a prod that I use to shoot.

46:50.360 --> 46:54.956
-Keep the pistol you? -This is what is left of him.

46:55.080 --> 46:57.833
Or related to it.

46:57.960 --> 47:01.589
Want to hear something funny? Can you see this?

47:01.720 --> 47:06.555
I was fifteen and would kill a stranger to death.

47:06.680 --> 47:10.673
So I called my friend and asked him to come and mendapatkanku.

47:10.800 --> 47:17.273
I want to do the murder plan, but I will not be driving without a license.

47:17.400 --> 47:20.710
The property of the community makes us really mad.

47:20.840 --> 47:24.389
It makes us ... What is it? What is it?

47:26.560 --> 47:29.757
-Do. -Yes, dammit.

47:29.880 --> 47:33.077
-Do. -Do.

47:33.200 --> 47:36.272
Yes we do.

47:37.120 --> 47:40.874
-Do, dammit. -Yes.

47:44.640 --> 47:47.473
Oh my God, just do it.

47:47.600 --> 47:50.114
The hell with it!

47:51.920 --> 47:55.879
Shoot, shoot, shoot. Do, do, just do it.

47:56.000 --> 47:59.629
-I'm serious! -Do!

47:59.760 --> 48:04.276
No, no, no. you have to see.

48:07.040 --> 48:14.037
Let's go! Want to suck this? I gave a little extra if you do so.

48:14.160 --> 48:20.679
It was just a joke. A trick. I know where the bullet is located.

48:20.800 --> 48:24.270
What is it with you? The last time you were so benign.

48:24.400 --> 48:27.153
Today you are not too fun.

48:27.280 --> 48:32.149
-She swallowed the "juice" you? -Yes, a little happy, he is now.

48:32.280 --> 48:35.397
The hell with it! The hell with it!

48:41.400 --> 48:45.439
For the devil. Maybe in a month's time.

48:54.680 --> 48:56.910
The hell with it. The hell with it.

49:09.000 --> 49:13.278
Shoot, shoot, shoot! Do! Do!

49:17.680 --> 49:20.148
Shoot, Shoot, Shoot ...

49:20.280 --> 49:25.195
Do! Do!

49:25.320 --> 49:27.959
Do!

49:45.080 --> 49:48.311
Fuck ... fuck ...

49:48.440 --> 49:50.476
The hell with it!

50:24.400 --> 50:28.234
Good morning, Alyce. You know what?

50:28.360 --> 50:34.629
Now officially decided you were fired ...

50:44.320 --> 50:48.677
I need something more powerful.

50:48.800 --> 50:52.110
It pays.

50:52.240 --> 50:55.277
-Wait a minute. chill out. -Come on.

50:55.400 --> 50:59.359
What is it? I do not know. Maybe I'll talk.

50:59.480 --> 51:03.359
-Too bad for me. -I'm serious.

51:03.480 --> 51:06.870
Hello! I'm serious.

51:07.000 --> 51:13.109
-Are you there? -Now? No, pretty funny.

51:13.240 --> 51:17.518
A bit strong for a woman?

51:17.640 --> 51:22.475
This is not the store location is randomly chosen.

51:22.600 --> 51:26.309
This is where, I own ...

51:26.440 --> 51:31.594
Whether this is the beginning ... of a beautiful friendship.

51:31.720 --> 51:37.716
-Come here and sit down. -No, thank you.

51:37.840 --> 51:40.957
You guys are both criminals like me.

51:41.080 --> 51:46.757
Who is the most fucked up? It is, or it comes with?

51:46.880 --> 51:50.634
If you're disappointed because I didn't want to sit next to you?

51:50.760 --> 51:54.594
It is not. But you have to understand ...

51:54.720 --> 52:00.352
I felt ... that you stand there and judge me.

52:02.840 --> 52:05.957
Can you see this?

52:06.080 --> 52:12.349
During prohibition, I can smoke in jail due to drinking beer.

52:12.480 --> 52:16.109
So who can decide what is right and wrong-

52:16.240 --> 52:19.357
-When the community can't decide?

52:19.480 --> 52:22.597
Are you saying that it is the fault of society?

52:22.720 --> 52:25.678
-Yes, in some ways. -If what it takes to ...

52:25.800 --> 52:30.430
... For you to sleep well, then, just to congratulate.

52:30.560 --> 52:36.317
-You are a buy. It's not me. -I am not praised.

52:36.440 --> 52:40.353
Most glorious centuries men have been treated as the criminals.

52:40.480 --> 52:44.951
We had Nelson Mandela, Martin Luther King and Gandhi.

52:45.080 --> 52:49.710
-Comparing you with Gandhi? -you're right.

52:49.840 --> 52:53.355
I am a small time crooks. I'm the villain.

52:53.480 --> 52:57.075
But I'm not nothing compared with politicians in Washington.

52:57.200 --> 53:02.320
Or Enron, Wall Street and the banks that let us in trouble.

53:02.440 --> 53:07.912
And what about the war, oil companies, Halliburton and tobacco industry?

53:08.040 --> 53:13.637
It is a crime to the extreme. But they do is legal.

53:13.760 --> 53:18.072
Who is the most evil? Those who sell McCancer burger-

53:18.200 --> 53:22.273
-The smÃ¥forbryderen Or Rob them?

53:22.400 --> 53:25.915
The whole system is the main house of cards.

53:26.040 --> 53:29.476
And it can turn around our ears.

53:29.600 --> 53:33.957
When the country is just so horrible like in the movie "Mad Max"-

53:34.080 --> 53:38.551
-So we are living at the bottom, has taken over.

53:38.680 --> 53:44.869
Some of us learn from the criminal world as if it were the natural environment.

53:45.000 --> 53:47.753
Some of us prefer to live under-

53:47.880 --> 53:52.112
-Because it feels like more of a regular, clean-living

53:52.240 --> 53:56.074
-Bland and sad crap out there.

53:58.920 --> 54:03.118
Nine to five? Almost not. I'm not going to wash the floor-

54:03.240 --> 54:09.713
-Staring at a computer screen or serving burgers and fries all day.

54:09.840 --> 54:13.628
May I ask a question? Do you you as an individual-

54:13.760 --> 54:20.233
-With something similar Only with values ...

54:24.080 --> 54:28.870
It ... you have to control your life?

54:29.000 --> 54:31.798
Wake Up, Sweetheart.

54:31.920 --> 54:37.233
It's you or them. Kill or be killed. Darwin's doctrine of the slum.

54:37.360 --> 54:42.388
This is the most cruel thing, not the strongest who survive.

54:42.520 --> 54:47.640
What does not kill us, dragging us out into the streets and sleep with us.

54:52.440 --> 54:55.796
Do you understand that? Who is mengendalikanmu?

55:01.160 --> 55:04.232
Come on. Thank you for the discussion.

55:14.640 --> 55:17.313
It is something new.

57:17.240 --> 57:20.630
I'm so sorry, Alyce.

57:20.760 --> 57:25.788
Oh Lord. When I saw you come like this ...

57:25.920 --> 57:29.037
Akua hope ... He follows almost from behind it.

57:29.160 --> 57:35.315
-I'm using to go back. -He left something with you?

57:38.800 --> 57:41.872
His bag is still there.

57:42.000 --> 57:46.198
-Can I get it? -Of course, Vince.

57:47.840 --> 57:52.391
What do you remember most?

57:52.520 --> 57:55.557
He was afraid of bats.

57:58.880 --> 58:01.269
I remember his eyes.

58:01.400 --> 58:06.269
When she saw a ...

58:06.400 --> 58:09.392
... It looks like he Sphinx.

58:09.520 --> 58:14.071
tease me and say, he's like an aquarium.

58:14.200 --> 58:18.193
There are so many such.

58:19.360 --> 58:22.670
I love him for it.

58:22.800 --> 58:27.874
But I also know that she's too good for me.

58:28.000 --> 58:32.710
So I'm so fucking stupid ...

58:32.840 --> 58:39.313
I'm doing things ... that hurts just to be one step ahead.

58:43.200 --> 58:46.192
It's okay, Sweetie.

58:49.800 --> 58:53.110
This is so terrible.

58:53.240 --> 59:00.157
Sad. But nobody was there for him when he needed it.

59:00.280 --> 59:03.431
-Bebrejder me? -No

59:03.560 --> 59:08.759
It is not the responsibility of you, dear. You can go ahead and that he knows.

59:08.880 --> 59:12.031
I think his friends.

59:12.160 --> 59:16.756
They should have been there and support him.

59:16.880 --> 59:22.557
If he has the support of ... he might have been alive today.

01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:14.150
You look terrible. What do they do to you?

01:00:14.280 --> 01:00:17.033
You look like.

01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:23.113
you were real.

01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:28.075
You're very soft. you feel so wonderful.

01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:34.758
-Carroll. -What does he do?

01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:41.552
I'm sorry.

01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:44.274
-Touch him.-Stop him!

01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:47.358
-What are you doing? -Lift, Al!

01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:54.070
-Alyce. What are you doing? -Alyce.

01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:01.789
-I want you to go. What do you like to be stoned? -Foster, Harold.

01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:04.753
What's wrong with you? I'm disgusted.

01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:10.432
-You're in charge! -Come On, Dad. Let him.

01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:13.597
you were right. I killed him.

01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:17.395
My first encouraged him he falls from the roof.

01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:22.116
But hit him not to die, so I took a pillow ...

01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:29.032
And ... squeeze out the life of Princess tercintamu!

01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:33.199
My best friend! I'm just a friend.

01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:36.630
Shit, Alyce.

01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:41.629
-What ... What are you doing? -Now you should be quiet!

01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:44.513
you have a lot of time to explain!

01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:49.509
-I want you to go now. go! -Foster, Harold! Lift.

01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:04.109
No, Al! you have to go, al. don't.

01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:08.634
I?

01:02:08.760 --> 01:02:15.029
-Do I have to go? Really? -Sorry.

01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:18.709
This is your fault.

01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:23.789
Necrophilic lesbian. you're sick.

01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:26.195
I always start training in figurative language.

01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:29.995
I run them out loud, so I says:

01:05:30.120 --> 01:05:33.157
"Now more Kurt."

01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:38.832
Instead of "now found driven." I called Kurt.

01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:41.554
Yes, I understand very well.

01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:45.229
This is a replication of a classic of the "Bugs Bunny".

01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:50.874
You should stop by.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:55.516
Trapezoid muscle it could use some work.

01:05:55.640 --> 01:05:59.315
We can work with delta.

01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:04.230
Not so much. you figure the feminine ...

01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:08.751
But ... you will get a more scrumptious. If this is possible.

01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:13.590
You should stop by. I'm going to merawatmu.

01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:17.076
I'll give you all what you need.

01:06:18.560 --> 01:06:21.836
you are certainly not much said.

01:06:26.760 --> 01:06:30.116
Let's go.

01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:38.551
It is easy to catch. I just love it.

01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:47.432
How can a place Cosy.

01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:57.036
I menyalahkanmu. I think that you are very closed.

01:06:57.160 --> 01:07:01.312
-Do Not Want? -No

01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:12.512
-Well, dammit, just us. -It gets better and better.

01:07:32.680 --> 01:07:35.399
Let me tell you one thing.

01:07:35.520 --> 01:07:38.830
It says here, I take care of all my girl.

01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:45.069
Now, as long as Kurt. When Kurt will be in you.

01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:49.671
-Only silence.-sounds good.

01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:52.553
You are very ...

01:07:55.760 --> 01:07:58.832
you ...

01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:05.479
-Wait, wait ...-What is it? Not too.

01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:08.637
Yes, there is.

01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:11.991
-Whether you have acne on your back. -What?

01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:16.477
-I did not use steroids. -Of course not.

01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:19.591
-Wouldn't you're screwing with me? -Okay.

01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:27.076
-Hell! What goes ... -This is better.

01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:31.432
No, it's not better. This is better.

01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:34.676
Okay. All right.

01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:38.475
-Damn! Sick! -What do you think?

01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:42.957
If you do not take steroids you will never have acne on your back.

01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:46.197
you're sick.

01:08:46.319 --> 01:08:50.073
Lie Down, "Big Boy". So calm, I got something.

01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:55.872
Okay. Okay. Okay.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:00.390
Just chill out and let me do the work.

01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:08.788
The hell with it! damn damn! I bleed.

01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:14.358

Want to taste my blood?

01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:22.631
-you are a headache. -you're done, Kurt.

01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:25.797
There is no worse thing. Okay?

01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:30.910
-What is enough? -Yes.

01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:37.308
Okay. Quiet.

01:10:54.440 --> 01:10:57.830
-Hello? -Hello. Are you at home?

01:10:57.960 --> 01:11:01.589

01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:05.554
Of course. Please come.

01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:08.877
Whether it's your girlfriend?

01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:21.988
Yes, it's really good. Was it good for you?

01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:25.157

Well, the sadness of what happened to you?

01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:58.870
Well, ... I was "pÃ¥kurt".

01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:04.070
-This looks bad. -Does nothing.

01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:09.479
-How are you? I was hanging-sign in

01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:12.558
I tried to bearda in it.

01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:20.035
Yes, I know. I know.

01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:22.913
It's okay.

01:12:25.720 --> 01:12:30.032
-you did not ask how I feel. -Sorry.

01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:34.438
-How are you? -I miss you.

01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:39.751
I so miss her.

01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:45.436
And I miss you.

01:12:55.720 --> 01:12:59.030
Al? What are you doing, Al?

01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:06.309
It's okay.

01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:17.351
Wait ...

01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:24.354
-What is it? The blood you? -Does nothing.

01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:27.040
It's okay.

01:13:28.200 --> 01:13:31.237
I can make you feel better.

01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:39.437
Wait, wait, wait. Stop.

01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:43.235
I just want to purse Carroll.

01:13:57.160 --> 01:14:00.835
Hello, Dear. Yes, I can't talk right now.

01:14:00.960 --> 01:14:04.236
Yes, I love you. Okay, Hello.

01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:14.915
-Wrong type of knife. -What?

01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:18.350
-I have a knife to a potluck. -What?

01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:32.309
What have you done?

01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:43.911
Help ... call anyone!

01:14:46.680 --> 01:14:49.513
O Lord!

I'm not going to die ...

01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:55.710
-You are very sad. -Do you want ...

01:14:55.840 --> 01:15:01.472
He wondered how it would ...

01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:04.433
Pathetic.

01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:08.348
-This is pathetic. -Help me.

01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:12.109
A disappointment.

01:15:12.240 --> 01:15:16.756
He will be disappointed.

01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:02.751
Hey. Can I borrow it?

01:18:02.880 --> 01:18:05.838
-Of course. Do you need help? -No

01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:08.394
-I was just practicing. -for what?

01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:11.398
How to get rid of the bodies.

01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:14.717
-Tell me if you need help. -Can I borrow this?

01:18:14.840 --> 01:18:18.037
-Of course. -Super. Thank you.

01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:25.350
you lost your head?

01:19:00.560 --> 01:19:03.358
Don't you know the time?

01:19:03.480 --> 01:19:08.634
-No, but I can find. -I didn't know what time it is.

01:19:08.760 --> 01:19:13.880
I have received a complaint about the noise.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.753
-Now it is night. -Sorry.

01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:20.634
-I was able to finish it tomorrow. -Finish what?

01:19:20.760 --> 01:19:26.198
I took care of a dead body, to make it easier to get rid of.

01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:29.790
-This is not funny. -I know.

01:19:48.160 --> 01:19:50.594
Hello?

01:19:50.720 --> 01:19:54.156
-Who is this? -The news from yesterday.

01:19:54.280 --> 01:19:57.431
Why take the Vinces phone?

01:19:57.560 --> 01:20:01.439
you of course can come and find out?

01:20:08.920 --> 01:20:12.196
Vince? Vince!

01:20:12.320 --> 01:20:14.993
-Vince! -you do not shout.

01:20:15.120 --> 01:20:18.192
-He's here? -Determining the "right here".

01:20:18.320 --> 01:20:23.952
-He's here? -He is here.

01:20:24.080 --> 01:20:27.117
But she was dead.

01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:31.597
Do not let me out. o that was betrayed.

01:20:31.720 --> 01:20:36.350
-you have a problem, Renee. -Do I have a problem?

01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:39.995
you the prototype of a madman with problems.

01:20:40.120 --> 01:20:43.874
-you need to be calm. -Do not decide.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:47.629
If you are not in control of myself, Renee, I did it.

01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:51.196
Come up with a way, bitch. What did you do?

01:20:51.320 --> 01:20:54.392
The knife sat in Vince.

01:20:54.520 --> 01:20:57.990
So I might destroy tengkorakmu with a baseball bat.

01:22:17.360 --> 01:22:20.955
-What are you doing here? -Put together some loose ends.

01:22:21.080 --> 01:22:25.119
you girlfriend Clark makes my life like dineraka ...

01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:29.074
- ... Because I have you fired. -He's not my boyfriend.

01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:32.158
It's not my fault.

01:22:32.280 --> 01:22:37.752
This is the policy of the company. I just do my job.

01:22:37.880 --> 01:22:42.874
Clark didn't see me when.. They just look at you, Alyce.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.958
They smiled at you.

01:22:46.080 --> 01:22:50.392
Why not see me?

01:22:50.520 --> 01:22:54.638
Why not see me?

01:23:04.040 --> 01:23:07.316
Well, what time it is now? Whether during the day?

01:23:07.440 --> 01:23:11.956
It's too early. I wake up when the sun goes down.

01:23:12.080 --> 01:23:15.197
What you need a ball into a tree?

01:23:15.320 --> 01:23:18.232
This helps me to be in control.

01:23:18.360 --> 01:23:22.035
-Who is your actual control? -Slut!

01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:27.712
Bitch!

01:23:27.840 --> 01:23:31.594
No! Drop it, dammit.

01:23:33.920 --> 01:23:37.151
What happened? Whether you've been mad?

01:23:37.280 --> 01:23:41.751
What is this, how is it? you destroyed my brother!

01:23:43.760 --> 01:23:48.072
Bitch. And obatku.

01:23:48.200 --> 01:23:51.272
you ... Are you crazy?

01:23:51.400 --> 01:23:57.032
Now you're just lying. I have a plan ... you!

01:24:00.400 --> 01:24:05.030
Yes, I own. From now on you my bitch.

01:24:05.160 --> 01:24:10.632
For the demons. No, you know this is what? This even better in. ..

01:24:10.760 --> 01:24:17.108
you play me ... damn. you play my damn.

01:24:17.240 --> 01:24:20.550
Not, anyway. Persetan. you my detention.

01:24:20.680 --> 01:24:23.433
I am Russian and you are ...

01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:57.599
What is possible?
