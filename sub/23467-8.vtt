00:01.435 --> 00:04.672
WOMAN: Paul's been having
a difficult time of late.

00:12.012 --> 00:14.648
FX presents Baskets.

00:14.682 --> 00:16.750
MAN: Get on with it!

00:19.853 --> 00:22.056
CHIP:
I'm kind of rebranding myself.

00:22.090 --> 00:25.025
We just had a barbecue funeral
for my old clown, Renoir.

00:25.059 --> 00:27.861
-I don't want no trouble.

00:27.895 --> 00:29.497
Well, I think you do
because ever since I met you,

00:29.530 --> 00:31.099
you've been stirring the pot.

00:31.132 --> 00:34.168
If we all stay in our own lanes
as business partners,

00:34.202 --> 00:36.036
we can get somewhere.

00:38.038 --> 00:40.941
KEN: Once upon a time,
there was a princess that lived

00:40.974 --> 00:43.077
in a big, dark, echoey castle.

00:43.111 --> 00:45.746
-That was no fun.
-Aw! -Aw!

00:45.779 --> 00:48.882
Then one day, the princess was
visited by her fairy godmother.

00:48.916 --> 00:50.851
Suddenly,
the princess had her choice

00:50.884 --> 00:54.522
of hundreds of styles and colors
of premium carpeting.

00:54.555 --> 00:55.956
What's your favorite color?

00:55.989 --> 00:57.725
How about...

00:57.758 --> 01:00.361
my favorite color is red.

01:00.394 --> 01:03.030
Red. We have those
in stock, too.

01:03.063 --> 01:05.366
Delivered in five
to seven business days.

01:05.399 --> 01:08.869
-How's the fairy godmother
do it, Daddy

01:08.902 --> 01:12.773
I think she had a little help
from the king.

01:12.806 --> 01:14.908
* Come see Ken,
The Carpet King. *

01:15.843 --> 01:17.778
So cute.

01:17.811 --> 01:19.380
Oh, come in. Sit down.

01:19.413 --> 01:22.316
Come in. I got you gifts
from the woman's conference.

01:22.350 --> 01:25.486
-I like your bangs.
-Thank you.

01:25.519 --> 01:27.488
-Hey, Chip.
-Hey, Mom.

01:27.521 --> 01:29.623
Oh.

01:29.657 --> 01:31.659
If it's a wrong size,
I can exchange it

01:31.692 --> 01:33.127
'cause I bought
a hundred of 'em.

01:33.161 --> 01:34.728
They gave me a deal.

01:34.762 --> 01:36.597
-I think it is.

01:36.630 --> 01:39.400
-Love it.
-Oh, good.

01:39.433 --> 01:41.635
Anyway, I know we've had
our ups and downs,

01:41.669 --> 01:42.970
but at the women's conference,

01:43.003 --> 01:45.473
I learned quite a bit
about business

01:45.506 --> 01:47.641
and I learned about branding.

01:47.675 --> 01:51.111
And we need to get the word out
on our rodeo.

01:51.145 --> 01:53.747
So, guess what.

01:53.781 --> 01:56.617
-We're gonna all have
to get bangs? -No.

01:56.650 --> 02:00.488
We're going to make a Baskets
Family Rodeo commercial.

02:00.521 --> 02:02.423
Oh, now you're talking
my language.

02:02.456 --> 02:03.824
-Thank you, Mother.
-Great idea, Mom.

02:03.857 --> 02:05.426
It's exciting, isn't it?

02:05.459 --> 02:09.597
Um, I was actually working
on a new clown character.

02:09.630 --> 02:11.932
-Maybe I can incorporate that.
-And because we have

02:11.965 --> 02:15.469
a expert in making commercials
amongst us,

02:15.503 --> 02:18.306
I'd like to take this time
to introduce...

02:18.339 --> 02:19.940
I don't need an introduction.

02:19.973 --> 02:21.709
...The Carpet King, Ken!

02:21.742 --> 02:24.678
-Howdy, everybody.

02:24.712 --> 02:26.547
Hi, Ken.

02:26.580 --> 02:28.382
-Hey, Ken.
-Hey, Chip.

02:28.416 --> 02:30.117
I will... Fake news! Fake news!

02:30.150 --> 02:31.619
I'm the commercial guy.

02:31.652 --> 02:32.786
Chip, tell them how many
commercials I've done

02:32.820 --> 02:34.355
for Baskets Career College.

02:34.388 --> 02:35.989
Zero?

02:36.023 --> 02:37.157
I've done 55 of them.

02:37.191 --> 02:38.726
It's not a competition, Dale.

02:38.759 --> 02:41.161
Yes, it is. Everything is.

02:41.195 --> 02:42.730
-God.
-Well, anyway,

02:42.763 --> 02:46.066
I called Channel 9
and I got the rates

02:46.099 --> 02:47.901
for a 30-second commercial.

02:47.935 --> 02:50.404
Before we make any decisions
about directing, let me, uh,

02:50.438 --> 02:52.373
just show you something that's,
uh... one of them went viral.

02:52.406 --> 02:54.041
-MRS. BASKETS: Oh.
-Yeah.

02:54.074 --> 02:57.110
Here it is. Two hits.

03:01.349 --> 03:03.083
It's really coming!

03:03.116 --> 03:04.985
Y2K is for real!

03:05.018 --> 03:07.421
Y2K.

03:07.455 --> 03:09.690
Are you ready
for the Y2K disaster

03:09.723 --> 03:11.158
that's gonna hit your town?

03:11.191 --> 03:14.595
Experts say the grid
is going down.

03:14.628 --> 03:16.897
Right, experts?

03:16.930 --> 03:20.501
Don't you get stuck in the
dead-end computer tech industry.

03:20.534 --> 03:23.003
Sign up for one
of our analog classes like:

03:23.036 --> 03:26.440
Archery, Motorcycle Law,

03:26.474 --> 03:29.109
Pottery, Child Pottery,

03:29.142 --> 03:31.178
Knife Sharpening,
Knife Throwing.

03:31.211 --> 03:32.179
Sorry.

03:32.212 --> 03:34.915
Child Care and Knife Law.

03:34.948 --> 03:38.252
Increase your chances
of survival while having a blast

03:38.286 --> 03:40.788
at Baskets Career College.

03:40.821 --> 03:43.056
Take it from me--
I'm not only the dean,

03:43.090 --> 03:44.792
but I'm building a bunker.

03:44.825 --> 03:46.860
Proud to be California's
first and only

03:46.894 --> 03:49.463
open carry career college.

03:49.497 --> 03:51.399
Uh, yes, hello.

03:51.432 --> 03:54.602
I'm looking
for a-a c-clown book section.

03:54.635 --> 03:57.871
Any books on clowning
or the history of clowning.

03:57.905 --> 04:00.641
I'm working on a character,
a clowning character.

04:00.674 --> 04:03.377
Uh, or, you know,
any kind of instruction manuals

04:03.411 --> 04:06.947
-on, um, creativity in general.
-Hmm.

04:06.980 --> 04:08.916
I'm a little rusty
on the Dewey Decimal System,

04:08.949 --> 04:10.250
so I need some help.

04:10.284 --> 04:12.420
So, have a seat here.

04:12.453 --> 04:14.955
I'll pull you some books
and I'll be right back.

04:14.988 --> 04:16.657
Okay, thank you.

04:41.715 --> 04:44.151
*

04:49.657 --> 04:51.224
That's good, though.

05:00.401 --> 05:02.636
LIBRARIAN:
Oh, no! No, Barry!

05:02.670 --> 05:03.804
I told you not to pee
in that plant!

05:03.837 --> 05:06.039
Out! Out!

05:06.073 --> 05:08.842
Oh! Oh, God!

05:08.876 --> 05:10.043
Oh.

05:10.077 --> 05:11.645
KEN:
I just think

05:11.679 --> 05:14.682
the more real and natural
your spot is,

05:14.715 --> 05:18.018
the more people can relate
and trust what you're saying.

05:18.051 --> 05:19.387
Hmm. That's too old-fashioned.

05:19.420 --> 05:20.954
What people want now
is razzle-dazzle.

05:20.988 --> 05:22.690
What that razzle-dazzle is,
is sex.

05:22.723 --> 05:24.525
You know, sex sells.

05:24.558 --> 05:27.060
They want cleavage, they want
midsections, that kind of thing.

05:27.094 --> 05:30.330
Boobies, tits, you know...

05:30.364 --> 05:31.665
But, Dale, it's a rodeo.

05:31.699 --> 05:35.403
Well, I'm not talking
like bestiality, Ken. Sicko.

05:35.436 --> 05:37.805
MRS. BASKETS:
I've got an idea.

05:37.838 --> 05:40.808
Why don't both of you
do your own commercial

05:40.841 --> 05:43.977
and then I'll decide
which one to use?

05:44.011 --> 05:45.679
Oh, you mean like a little
film festival type thing.

05:45.713 --> 05:47.180
MRS. BASKETS:
Uh-huh.

05:47.214 --> 05:49.417
I could be into that.
I could, I could do, like,

05:49.450 --> 05:51.685
a little competition,
if that's what you mean.

05:51.719 --> 05:53.921
-Sure. I'm cool with it.
-DALE: Okay, Ken.

05:53.954 --> 05:57.257
-Let the best man win.

05:57.290 --> 05:58.692
CHIP:
So, are you guys gonna want

05:58.726 --> 06:01.061
two different clowns
for each spot?

06:01.094 --> 06:03.163
'Cause I have a lot of, a lot
of options I can give you.

06:03.196 --> 06:06.900
Nothing really specific,
uh, yet.

06:06.934 --> 06:10.203
Uh, but I have the essence
of-of several clowns, um, but,

06:10.237 --> 06:13.841
uh, they're still kind of
in the-the building phase. Um...

06:13.874 --> 06:16.076
You'll bring your clown nose,
right?

06:16.109 --> 06:18.378
'Cause I think
that's all we need.

06:18.412 --> 06:21.248
Yeah, there's-there's more to it
than that, though.

06:21.281 --> 06:23.751
I know. I know.

06:23.784 --> 06:25.252
Nobody really gives a shit
about that.

06:25.285 --> 06:27.120
Uh, yeah, I have a nose.

06:27.154 --> 06:28.388
MRS. BASKETS:
Good.

06:28.422 --> 06:30.691
Anyway, you know what I like?

06:30.724 --> 06:32.359
I love a jingle.

06:32.392 --> 06:34.462
Like, at the end of the spot.

06:34.495 --> 06:37.598
Like... * Ro, ro, rodeo. *

06:37.631 --> 06:41.201
Baby, I'll do
whatever you want. -Oh.

06:41.234 --> 06:42.803
See, but he has
a sexual advantage on you

06:42.836 --> 06:43.971
that I don't have.

06:44.004 --> 06:46.273
I can be objective.

06:46.306 --> 06:47.475
Okay.

06:48.776 --> 06:50.210
Oh, the pie!

06:50.243 --> 06:51.712
Chip, will you get the pie
for me?

06:51.745 --> 06:53.747
-Yep.
-Thank you.

06:53.781 --> 06:55.382
No pie for me.

06:55.415 --> 06:58.285
Thank you very much
for the tacos, Mother. Kenneth.

07:00.821 --> 07:02.956
I got that
from the woman's conference,

07:02.990 --> 07:05.626
pitting people against
each other, competition.

07:05.659 --> 07:08.128
I knew you had
something cooking over there.

07:08.161 --> 07:09.396
-Oh, it's hot!
-Aah!

07:09.429 --> 07:10.598
That's hot!

07:10.631 --> 07:13.433
Oh. Are you okay?

07:13.467 --> 07:16.069
Scorched my arm.

07:16.103 --> 07:17.471
Oh, God.

07:17.505 --> 07:19.573
What about Clumbso
for a name for a clown?

07:19.607 --> 07:21.609
:
Oh.

07:25.946 --> 07:27.815
Just like a TV weatherman,

07:27.848 --> 07:29.950
setting up a green screen.

07:29.983 --> 07:31.519
MRS. BASKETS :
Paging Dale Baskets.

07:31.552 --> 07:33.487
It's your mother.
Please come to the barn area.

07:33.521 --> 07:35.422
We're shooting
Ken's commercial.

07:35.455 --> 07:38.025
Starting already? I'm still
setting up my commercial.

07:38.058 --> 07:41.361
Dale, we're all here,
waiting for you.

07:41.394 --> 07:45.032
Your outfit's laid out
on the chair, honey.

07:45.065 --> 07:47.668
DALE:
But I already have a nice top.

07:47.701 --> 07:49.336
-Yeah, yeah,
we're looking really great.

07:49.369 --> 07:51.138
Thanks for making the cue cards.

07:51.171 --> 07:53.541
Now, Chip, I want you to stand
right here next to your mom.

07:53.574 --> 07:55.876
-That should be your mark.
-CHIP: I wanted to thank you

07:55.909 --> 07:57.645
for not holding
my feet next to the fire

07:57.678 --> 07:58.946
for my new clown character.

07:58.979 --> 08:00.480
It's-it's almost there,

08:00.514 --> 08:02.783
it's just not there yet,
so thanks for understanding.

08:02.816 --> 08:05.185
Yeah. Great. Sure.

08:05.218 --> 08:07.320
-Here I am.
-KEN: Dale! Looking good.

08:07.354 --> 08:08.556
Put a mic on him.

08:08.589 --> 08:10.157
Hi, I'm Greg.

08:10.190 --> 08:11.491
I'm gonna put a mic on you.

08:11.525 --> 08:13.193
Okay. Good for you, Greg.

08:13.226 --> 08:15.796
All right, and this is gonna go
right down here.

08:15.829 --> 08:17.898
-Whoa, your hands... I got it.
Thank you very much. -Oh...

08:17.931 --> 08:20.400
Your hands are a bit... chilly.

08:20.433 --> 08:22.836
-Your mark is right here next
to your mom. -Thank you, Ken.

08:23.937 --> 08:26.574
Hey, Mom. God, you look
like Nellie Oleson.

08:26.607 --> 08:28.308
:
It's not a compliment, Mother.

08:28.341 --> 08:32.012
Okay, so, now,
this is a Wild West scenario.

08:32.045 --> 08:33.881
We're gonna start
with Christine's first line,

08:33.914 --> 08:36.316
then we'll go over to Chip,

08:36.349 --> 08:37.685
then we'll push in to Dale,
and then

08:37.718 --> 08:39.086
we'll swing back to Christine.

08:39.119 --> 08:41.021
-GREG: Perfect.

08:41.054 --> 08:42.522
-All right, here we go.

08:42.556 --> 08:44.324
Lines are on the cue cards.

08:44.357 --> 08:46.059
-Mm-hmm.
-Okay. Here we go.

08:46.093 --> 08:47.260
GREG:
We're rolling.

08:47.294 --> 08:49.162
And action.

08:49.196 --> 08:52.499
Y'all come down
to the Baskets Family Rodeo.

08:52.532 --> 08:55.368
Horses and bulls,
cowboys and clowns.

08:55.402 --> 08:57.838
We're Baskersfie...

08:57.871 --> 08:58.839
I said "Bask..."

08:58.872 --> 09:01.341
We're Basketsfield's new...

09:01.374 --> 09:02.676
-MRS. BASKETS: Bakersfield.
-DALE: "We're Bakersfield's..."

09:02.710 --> 09:04.111
It's a tongue twister.

09:04.144 --> 09:05.879
-Bakersfield's.
It's a mouthful.

09:05.913 --> 09:07.715
I think it's because you put
the possessive on it.

09:07.748 --> 09:09.549
That's okay, that's okay,
it was just a rehearsal.

09:09.583 --> 09:11.685
We're just loosening up, okay?

09:11.719 --> 09:13.086
All right, everybody ready?

09:14.454 --> 09:15.623
KEN:
Here we go.

09:15.656 --> 09:17.891
And action.

09:17.925 --> 09:21.261
Y'all come down
to the Baskets Family Rodeo.

09:21.294 --> 09:23.396
Horses and bulls,
cowboys and clowns.

09:23.430 --> 09:26.600
We're Bakersfield's new home
for family flan.

09:26.634 --> 09:28.401
-Fawn. Fun.
-MRS. BASKETS: Ah!

09:28.435 --> 09:29.870
-Almost.

09:29.903 --> 09:32.539
Dale, it's "family fun."

09:32.572 --> 09:35.609
I know what I'm doing;
I used to date a videographer.

09:35.643 --> 09:37.210
KEN:
It's okay, it's okay, Dale.

09:37.244 --> 09:39.446
Just take your time, we'll...
L-Let's do another one.

09:39.479 --> 09:40.748
-All right.

09:40.781 --> 09:43.583
Hold on, let me just... Go.

09:43.617 --> 09:45.085
We're all set now?
You got the line?

09:45.118 --> 09:46.486
-Yes.
-All right.

09:46.519 --> 09:47.721
Here we go.

09:47.755 --> 09:49.556
Ready? And action.

09:49.589 --> 09:53.393
Y'all come down
to the Baskets Family Rodeo.

09:53.426 --> 09:56.096
Horses and bulls,
cowboys and clowns.

09:56.129 --> 09:57.430
We're Nakersfield's boo vas...

09:59.933 --> 10:02.636
We're Nakersfield's blue...

10:02.670 --> 10:05.072
We're Naker...
we're Bakersfield's blue...

10:05.105 --> 10:06.774
we're Nakers... we're Bakers...

10:06.807 --> 10:07.975
we're Na...

10:08.008 --> 10:09.777
We're Bakersfield's new game...

10:11.344 --> 10:12.980
The lady is...
you're blocking half of it,

10:13.013 --> 10:14.481
so I don't know
if it says "home,"

10:14.514 --> 10:16.650
-"game."
-Okay, let's try one more.

10:16.684 --> 10:18.652
Okay? Here we go.
Lots of energy.

10:18.686 --> 10:21.354
Can you not talk anymore,
during the shoot, please?

10:21.388 --> 10:23.623
Because it's kind of
throwing off my emotionalness

10:23.657 --> 10:25.859
of the, of the scene.

10:25.893 --> 10:27.027
Okay,

10:27.060 --> 10:28.528
-Dale.
-Dale, just...

10:28.561 --> 10:30.330
just chill out, okay?

10:30.363 --> 10:31.932
Yeah, you relax.

10:31.965 --> 10:33.200
All right, here we go.

10:33.233 --> 10:34.201
Lots of energy.

10:34.234 --> 10:37.137
Ready, and action.

10:37.170 --> 10:39.639
Y'all come down
to the Baskets Family Rodeo.

10:39.673 --> 10:42.342
Horses and bulls,
cowboys and clowns.

10:42.375 --> 10:45.178
We're Bakersfield's new home
for family fun.

10:45.212 --> 10:47.815
You'll have
a rootin' tootin' grea...

10:47.848 --> 10:49.516
Is it "good..." "great time"

10:49.549 --> 10:51.151
-DALE: Ha!

10:51.184 --> 10:52.452
Idiot. That's the easiest line

10:52.485 --> 10:54.487
on the whole thing, Mom,
and you screwed it up.

10:54.521 --> 10:57.825
I mean, you have the least
amount of syllables or words.

10:57.858 --> 11:00.861
"You'll have a rootin' tootin'
good time." Who can't say that?

11:00.894 --> 11:03.630
-I need to get
some more lipstick.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.132
-You need something.
-KEN: Christine.

11:05.165 --> 11:07.400
-Wait a minute.
-I'm fine, I'm fine.

11:07.434 --> 11:10.303
Let her go.

11:10.337 --> 11:12.305
You're such a tool.

11:12.339 --> 11:14.007
Well, least I'm not
a dumb old woman.

11:27.554 --> 11:30.023
:
You're a witness.

11:31.358 --> 11:34.061
You're a witness.

11:34.094 --> 11:37.197
You're a witness.
And you're a witness.

11:37.230 --> 11:38.331
You know why?

11:38.365 --> 11:39.867
'Cause you hit me!

11:39.900 --> 11:41.268
You slapped my beard!

11:41.301 --> 11:43.536
Nobody slaps my beard!

11:48.108 --> 11:49.910
GREG:
Hey, let me get that mic.

11:49.943 --> 11:51.711
-Get the mic off of me, please.
-Uh, a-all right.

11:51.745 --> 11:53.546
You're not gonna
hit me, too, are you?

11:53.580 --> 11:56.750
-GREG: No, it's fine. -DALE:
I got it. Just let go of it!

11:56.784 --> 11:58.185
-No, it's almost there.
-That's good. Thank you.

11:58.218 --> 11:59.452
No, it's stuck...

12:12.833 --> 12:14.701
Do you have a pen on you?

12:14.734 --> 12:16.236
Oh, God.

12:16.269 --> 12:17.771
What did I just do?

12:17.805 --> 12:19.206
No?

12:19.239 --> 12:20.808
Okay. I got it in here.

12:20.841 --> 12:22.209
SAM: If you're a farmer
or ranch hand

12:22.242 --> 12:24.144
who's been injured on a job,

12:24.177 --> 12:25.946
you don't want to talk to any
big city lawyer who doesn't know

12:25.979 --> 12:27.915
the difference
between alfalfa and ripgut.

12:27.948 --> 12:29.116
I'm one of you.

12:29.149 --> 12:30.951
Driller, class of '78.

12:30.984 --> 12:33.120
NARRATOR: Country lawyer
Sam Hill has been defending

12:33.153 --> 12:36.824
the citizens of Bakersfield
since 1994.

12:36.857 --> 12:39.126
Sam, I realize it's Saturday,
but this is an emergency.

12:39.159 --> 12:40.961
I want to re-sue my mother.

12:40.994 --> 12:42.395
Actually, her boyfriend.

12:42.429 --> 12:43.730
He hit me.

12:43.763 --> 12:45.132
SAM :
He hit you

12:45.165 --> 12:46.834
He smacked me
right across my face!

12:46.867 --> 12:48.501
Were there any witnesses?

12:48.535 --> 12:49.903
Uh, yeah.

12:49.937 --> 12:52.172
Hold on one second.

12:52.205 --> 12:54.674
"Chip, where are you?

12:54.707 --> 12:56.776
Need you for legal reasons"

12:56.810 --> 12:58.912
question mark,
exclamation point,

12:58.946 --> 13:01.181
distraught face emoji.

13:01.214 --> 13:04.751
-Send.

13:11.291 --> 13:14.494
-Christine.
-Sorry I walked out, Ken.

13:14.527 --> 13:16.029
I just lost it.

13:16.063 --> 13:17.865
I'll be done with my makeup
in a minute,

13:17.898 --> 13:18.999
and I'll be ready
to shoot again.

13:19.032 --> 13:20.100
No, the shoot's off.

13:20.133 --> 13:21.134
-Uh...

13:21.168 --> 13:22.602
Dale kept mouthing off, and I...

13:23.736 --> 13:25.372
I just lost it.

13:25.405 --> 13:27.107
And I slapped him.

13:27.140 --> 13:29.709
What? What... He...
You what?

13:29.742 --> 13:30.878
I slapped him.

13:30.911 --> 13:32.345
What... wha... How would you...?

13:32.379 --> 13:33.446
Why would...?

13:33.480 --> 13:34.547
Christine, I'm sorry.

13:34.581 --> 13:35.648
Oh.

13:35.682 --> 13:37.317
K-Ken, give me a minute.

13:37.350 --> 13:38.785
Give me a minute, please.

13:38.818 --> 13:41.121
Not now.

13:51.598 --> 13:53.901
Where's Chip?

13:53.934 --> 13:55.969
(à la "In the Hall
of the Mountain King"):
* We are having a big sale *

13:56.003 --> 13:58.338
* Wigs and capes,
bats and apes *

13:58.371 --> 14:01.641
* Oh, but wait, we're not
just any Halloween store *

14:01.674 --> 14:03.176
* We are open all year round *

14:03.210 --> 14:05.078
* What's that sound?
Santa's sleigh *

14:05.112 --> 14:06.679
* We have giant Easter eggs *

14:06.713 --> 14:08.515
* Uncle Sam, witches' legs *

14:08.548 --> 14:11.551
* We are having a big sale,
call and ask, prices slashed *

14:11.584 --> 14:14.021
* We aren't just a Halloween
and costume store *

14:14.054 --> 14:16.890
* We do birthdays, with a theme
or no theme, you're the boss *

14:16.924 --> 14:19.159
* And we do Bar Mitzvahs
for an added price *

14:19.192 --> 14:21.628
* Open till nine. *

14:25.899 --> 14:27.901
(humming "In the Hall
of the Mountain King")

14:30.237 --> 14:32.105
Can I help you find something?

14:32.139 --> 14:34.074
Yes, hi, um,
I'm a professional clown,

14:34.107 --> 14:37.044
and I'm looking for
some clown accessories.

14:37.077 --> 14:39.512
Um, kind of working on
a new clown character.

14:39.546 --> 14:42.950
Our clown wigs and noses
and horns are over there.

14:42.983 --> 14:45.118
-Okay.
-You know what's cool right now

14:45.152 --> 14:46.519
is evil clowns.

14:46.553 --> 14:48.355
If you get, like,
balloons and an ax

14:48.388 --> 14:51.024
and some playing cards
with, like, blood on it,

14:51.058 --> 14:52.592
people flip out.

14:52.625 --> 14:54.294
No, I'm looking for more of a...
idiot.

14:54.327 --> 14:55.795
-Idiot clown.

14:55.828 --> 14:58.765
-Gah! Damn skeletons!

14:58.798 --> 15:00.267
What are you doing here?

15:00.300 --> 15:02.869
That man, that stranger--

15:02.902 --> 15:05.472
he slapped me in my face,
and you are my witness.

15:05.505 --> 15:08.908
So, you are gonna be calling
my lawyer.

15:08.942 --> 15:10.910
I'm gonna sue him
and his entire family.

15:10.944 --> 15:13.280
Is this a stickup?

15:13.313 --> 15:15.949
No. I got this.

15:15.983 --> 15:17.150
-Calm down.
-Don't touch me!

15:17.184 --> 15:18.385
I was just assaulted!

15:18.418 --> 15:19.819
I will not be silenced!

15:19.852 --> 15:21.121
I just want you to shut up!

15:21.154 --> 15:22.655
This is a place of business.

15:22.689 --> 15:24.457
Give me your avails
for next week.

15:24.491 --> 15:26.126
I need to set up an appointment
so you can give your testimony

15:26.159 --> 15:27.894
to the grand jury
about the attack.

15:27.927 --> 15:30.563
Here's my testimony: You got
slapped because you deserve it,

15:30.597 --> 15:32.065
'cause you've been
a real jerk to Mom.

15:32.099 --> 15:33.300
Oh, you're playing
the race card.

15:33.333 --> 15:35.102
It's so typical
of you white people.

15:36.269 --> 15:38.071
-God!

15:38.105 --> 15:39.172
Are you in here, honey?

15:39.206 --> 15:41.108
-Aah!

15:41.141 --> 15:42.475
Oh, God!

15:42.509 --> 15:46.179
Everything's 75% off.

15:46.213 --> 15:49.016
Dale! Dale, it's your mother!

15:49.049 --> 15:50.984
-CHIP: Mom,

15:51.018 --> 15:53.486
we're right here.
You don't have to yell.

15:53.520 --> 15:56.256
-Dale.

15:56.289 --> 15:58.191
Ken told me what happened.

15:58.225 --> 16:00.327
I'm so sorry.
Let me see your face.

16:00.360 --> 16:02.195
No, no, no.
You're-you're the enemy.

16:02.229 --> 16:04.831
-You're part of the problem.

16:04.864 --> 16:09.169
Your boyfriend slapped my face,
Mom, and you, you loved it.

16:09.202 --> 16:10.637
I wasn't even there.

16:10.670 --> 16:13.606
I don't even understand
how it happened.

16:13.640 --> 16:15.175
I don't understand how it
doesn't happen more often.

16:15.208 --> 16:16.443
You shut your mouth.

16:16.476 --> 16:18.645
-Chip, you're not helping.
-Yeah.

16:18.678 --> 16:19.979
MRS. BASKETS:
You're just upset.

16:20.013 --> 16:21.281
I'm sorry about this.

16:21.314 --> 16:23.450
I'm used to it.
My parents are bikers.

16:23.483 --> 16:25.818
Yeah, I'm a little-little,
uh, flummoxed.

16:25.852 --> 16:27.187
Yeah, I mean,
to use a Jewish term,

16:27.220 --> 16:29.289
-I'm a little flummoxed.
-Well, why don't

16:29.322 --> 16:31.524
you come home and I'll put
some ice on your cheek?

16:31.558 --> 16:32.859
Oh, that's...
that is not gonna happen!

16:32.892 --> 16:33.860
-I'll tell you that.

16:33.893 --> 16:35.828
-That will not... -Aah!

16:35.862 --> 16:37.864
-Oh, he's trying to kill me!

16:37.897 --> 16:40.500
I'm gonna stay over here, Dale.

16:40.533 --> 16:42.635
I've just come to say I'm sorry.

16:42.669 --> 16:44.304
I don't know what come over me.

16:44.337 --> 16:47.240
-Save it for the judge, buddy!

16:47.274 --> 16:48.741
Dale, no.

16:48.775 --> 16:51.878
Oh, yes, Mother.
A judge.

16:51.911 --> 16:53.713
And guess what.
I'm gonna take you

16:53.746 --> 16:56.983
all the way
to the Supreme Court.

16:59.018 --> 17:00.220
You're just upset.

17:00.253 --> 17:02.655
Yeah, I'm upset!
Stop saying that!

17:02.689 --> 17:05.225
CASHIER: Uh, real quick, we're
closing in about five minutes,

17:05.258 --> 17:07.160
so if you have any purchases,

17:07.194 --> 17:09.229
bring them up
to the counter now.

17:09.262 --> 17:10.663
Mom, I think
we should buy something,

17:10.697 --> 17:11.831
as as apology, you know.

17:11.864 --> 17:14.201
Oh, uh, sure.

17:14.234 --> 17:17.537
Uh, how about some of those
little, uh, pumpkin lights?

17:17.570 --> 17:18.738
They're cute.

17:18.771 --> 17:20.039
Go ahead and buy your pumpkins!

17:20.073 --> 17:21.741
Go ahead.
'Cause you know why?

17:21.774 --> 17:26.213
I'm gonna sue you, you,
you, not you.

17:27.447 --> 17:29.582
Is he suing me?

17:30.883 --> 17:33.886
MRS. BASKETS:
Dale...

17:33.920 --> 17:36.556
leave the skeleton alone.

17:39.292 --> 17:40.960
He's already dead, Dale.

17:42.829 --> 17:45.932
And... I have an announcement
to make!

17:45.965 --> 17:48.568
I'm leaving
this godforsaken town!

17:48.601 --> 17:50.570
I'm gonna buy a Jet Ski

17:50.603 --> 17:52.772
and move up to Alaska,

17:52.805 --> 17:54.107
or something like there!

17:54.141 --> 17:56.143
Maybe hitchhike to Burning Man!

17:56.176 --> 17:59.579
The point being, I'm outta here!

17:59.612 --> 18:02.749
And I'm never coming back! Ever!

18:05.585 --> 18:08.388
Oh, it's locked.
Excuse me.

18:10.657 --> 18:11.924
Dale.

18:11.958 --> 18:13.426
Hurry, lady.

18:13.460 --> 18:14.761
You're messing up my dismount.

18:16.028 --> 18:17.430
MRS. BASKETS:
Oh, God.

18:17.464 --> 18:20.300
I'm sorry.
We're not normally like this.

18:20.333 --> 18:23.236
It's no problem.
You have cute hair, by the way.

18:23.270 --> 18:26.473
Thank you.
I needed that, kind of.

18:26.506 --> 18:28.141
Let me take you home, Christine.

18:28.175 --> 18:32.145
No. Let me take you home, Ken.
Let's go.

18:32.179 --> 18:35.815
-Oh, shut up.

18:40.320 --> 18:42.455
WOMAN :
The white zone is for immediate

18:42.489 --> 18:45.658
loading and unloading
of passengers only.

18:45.692 --> 18:49.796
KEN: Christine,
I can't explain my actions.

18:49.829 --> 18:52.799
I just want to ask you
for your forgiveness.

18:52.832 --> 18:56.703
Go home. We'll talk about it
in a week.

18:56.736 --> 18:59.672
KEN: But I'm afraid if I leave,
it'll be all over.

18:59.706 --> 19:02.275
I don't want that.

19:02.309 --> 19:05.378
Well, I've got to figure out
what I want.

19:05.412 --> 19:07.280
Look,

19:07.314 --> 19:10.817
I know I made a huge mistake.

19:10.850 --> 19:14.454
But, please, just know that

19:14.487 --> 19:16.889
I care for you very deeply.

19:16.923 --> 19:19.192
Just go home, Ken.
