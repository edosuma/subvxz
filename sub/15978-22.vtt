WEBVTT

00:05.406 --> 00:06.374
Mm!

00:06.407 --> 00:08.342
Oh, God,
that is so hot.

00:08.376 --> 00:10.611
Aw, yeah.
(coughs)

00:10.644 --> 00:12.413
Something's wrong
with the heater thingy.

00:12.446 --> 00:13.581
I keep telling people.

00:13.614 --> 00:15.783
That water's coming out,
like, lawsuit hot.

00:15.816 --> 00:17.451
Thanks, Devin.

00:17.485 --> 00:19.553
You ever think of telling people
that before they drink?

00:19.587 --> 00:22.290
Nah. You know,
I'm in the legal department,

00:22.323 --> 00:24.325
and we kind of need the work.

00:25.526 --> 00:28.129
Ever since they fired
Susan the sexual harasser,

00:28.162 --> 00:30.564
things have been slow.
Yeah.

00:30.598 --> 00:32.533
It was a lot more fun
with Susan around.

00:32.566 --> 00:34.402
(laughs)
RAY:
Hey, Nate.

00:34.435 --> 00:36.370
Remember when you set me
up with that blind date

00:36.404 --> 00:37.538
with Janice's
ugly cousin?

00:37.571 --> 00:38.639
Now we're even.

00:40.574 --> 00:42.243
Hey, uh, Miller.

00:42.276 --> 00:44.845
Ray says he's busy
Friday night, but, uh,

00:44.878 --> 00:47.315
he mentioned that
you don't have any plans.

00:47.348 --> 00:49.350
You and I are gonna party.

00:49.383 --> 00:52.220
I need another tomcat
to go tomcatting with.

00:52.253 --> 00:53.354
(laughs)

00:53.387 --> 00:54.588
Sir, I-I'd love
to go tomcatting.

00:54.622 --> 00:56.190
I mean, who doesn't,
these days?

00:56.224 --> 00:58.426
But don't you
have a wife?

00:58.459 --> 01:00.128
(chuckles)
Divorce.

01:00.161 --> 01:02.096
Dang job came between us.

01:02.130 --> 01:03.497
Hmm.

01:03.531 --> 01:05.366
Dang Job is the name
of the acupuncturist

01:05.399 --> 01:07.168
she was sleeping with.

01:09.437 --> 01:12.140
Come on, you and me,
Friday night.

01:12.173 --> 01:14.675
Huh? Give me some skin, baby.

01:14.708 --> 01:17.445
Out of sight.

01:17.478 --> 01:20.148
I-I'll come by, I'll
pick you up at, uh, 7:30.

01:20.181 --> 01:22.583
Uh, you know, I could do
7:00 if you want to teach me

01:22.616 --> 01:25.286
some new dance moves or,
indeed, some bedroom tactics

01:25.319 --> 01:26.587
that people are doing now.

01:28.289 --> 01:31.259
I'm an old dog, but I can
learn new tricks, baby.

01:32.360 --> 01:34.728
Ray, how could you
do this to me, man?

01:34.762 --> 01:36.697
Janice's cousin
wasn't that ugly.

01:36.730 --> 01:38.299
She just had
a gap-toothed smile.

01:38.332 --> 01:40.634
Come on, it was
more gap than tooth.

01:40.668 --> 01:43.637
She ate a whole breadstick
without opening her mouth.

01:45.206 --> 01:46.640
Hey, you know, Miller,
you know, something...

01:46.674 --> 01:48.876
something's really bugging
me, and I need to get it...

01:48.909 --> 01:51.345
out in the open before
we go out tonight.

01:51.379 --> 01:53.547
You see, when I-I slap
tens with someone,

01:53.581 --> 01:57.385
I need to slide it off,
you know, real cool, like...

01:57.418 --> 01:59.653
I mean... I mean, the chicks--
they-they really dig that.

01:59.687 --> 02:02.390
And I think we need to
practice before tonight.

02:02.423 --> 02:03.891
So, uh, come on.
Give me the palms.

02:06.494 --> 02:08.429
Now you feel
that, huh? Huh?

02:08.462 --> 02:10.931
Groovy, right?

02:10.964 --> 02:13.201
Very-very groovy, sir.
Okay, now you.

02:13.234 --> 02:14.868
Come on, you. Come
on. Give it a whirl.

02:14.902 --> 02:16.304
Come on.

02:17.738 --> 02:19.773
Slow down.
Where you going?

02:19.807 --> 02:21.709
Where you go...
Whoa-whoa, whoa.

02:21.742 --> 02:23.444
Attaboy.

02:23.477 --> 02:24.912
You know, if you two
are sleeping together,

02:24.945 --> 02:26.847
I'm gonna need you
to fill out some paperwork.

02:53.707 --> 02:55.276
So what? Your boss
wants you

02:55.309 --> 02:56.777
to be his wingman,
big deal.

02:56.810 --> 02:59.247
Yeah, I can't go to a bar
and pick up women

02:59.280 --> 03:00.581
with a man in his 60s.

03:00.614 --> 03:02.550
He said he needs
to stop on the way

03:02.583 --> 03:04.585
and pick up
a compression sock.

03:06.720 --> 03:09.957
Not entirely sure
it's for his feet.

03:09.990 --> 03:11.692
I'll be honest,
I don't see anything

03:11.725 --> 03:12.826
weird about this, either.

03:12.860 --> 03:14.828
Yeah. Says the guy
who made cheese

03:14.862 --> 03:16.397
from his wife's breast milk.

03:19.500 --> 03:21.735
Breast milk is the number one
super food.

03:21.769 --> 03:24.438
I didn't need to wear
my glasses that whole year.

03:25.606 --> 03:26.874
I'm gonna go throw up.

03:28.609 --> 03:32.246
Look, I'd love to cancel,
but I can't snub my own boss.

03:32.280 --> 03:33.481
All right, so go out
with him once

03:33.514 --> 03:34.815
and make sure he never
wants to do it again.

03:34.848 --> 03:37.251
Just give him the old
South Side Mall treatment.

03:37.285 --> 03:39.953
Ugh. The South Side Mall.
That place is the worst.

03:39.987 --> 03:41.622
It's hot, it's dirty,

03:41.655 --> 03:44.425
and it has the saddest
merry-go-round.

03:44.458 --> 03:47.461
Those horses just stare out
with dead eyes, saying,

03:47.495 --> 03:49.563
"When will it end?"

03:51.799 --> 03:53.767
Yeah, exactly. You go once
and you never want to go back.

03:53.801 --> 03:55.836
It's what we do when Mikayla
brings home a friend

03:55.869 --> 03:58.572
we don't like; we just turn the
house into the South Side Mall.

03:58.606 --> 04:00.808
Yup. We crank the heat,
blast Bjork,

04:00.841 --> 04:03.377
close all the windows
and steam some broccoli.

04:03.411 --> 04:05.579
What do you want him to do,
make himself look bad

04:05.613 --> 04:07.481
in front of his boss?
He can't do that.

04:07.515 --> 04:08.482
Yeah, she's right.

04:08.516 --> 04:10.684
I mean, it's impossible
for me to be unlikeable.

04:10.718 --> 04:11.919
Believe me, I've tried.

04:11.952 --> 04:13.621
We were in high school,

04:13.654 --> 04:15.789
I ruined A Christmas Carol
with my Scrooge.

04:15.823 --> 04:17.391
Director said
he'd never seen a crowd

04:17.425 --> 04:18.792
turn against Tiny Tim before.

04:20.561 --> 04:22.830
Look, you can ditch someone
and still have them like you.

04:22.863 --> 04:24.965
You just have to
pass them off on someone else.

04:24.998 --> 04:27.301
I did it all the time
when I was teaching.

04:27.335 --> 04:29.603
Remember Ms. Parker
and Coach Deborah?

04:29.637 --> 04:32.406
I pawned them off on each other
and that turned out beautifully.

04:32.440 --> 04:35.042
Yeah, didn't you sing at their
civil union a few years ago?

04:35.075 --> 04:36.844
I rewrote the lyrics and sang

04:36.877 --> 04:39.780
"It's Raining Women."

04:39.813 --> 04:41.882
Look, I'd love to pawn
Ed off on someone

04:41.915 --> 04:43.951
he has something
more in common with.

04:43.984 --> 04:46.787
But the problem is I don't know
any single 60-year-old losers

04:46.820 --> 04:48.789
who are in desperate need
of companionship.

04:48.822 --> 04:51.925
My bee friends are gone.

04:51.959 --> 04:53.894
The hive collapsed,
the queen left.

04:53.927 --> 04:55.763
And the whole colony
followed her

04:55.796 --> 04:58.399
without so much as a good-bye.

04:58.432 --> 05:01.435
I got to go check
on my ant hills.

05:01.469 --> 05:02.903
God forbid they left me, too.

05:02.936 --> 05:05.639
If they did,
someone better be ready

05:05.673 --> 05:08.509
to take me out for ice cream.

05:08.542 --> 05:11.945
Oh, come on, well,
that's just too easy.

05:13.647 --> 05:15.849
Oh, I don't know
if he's gonna go for Dad.

05:15.883 --> 05:18.419
I mean, Mr. Dolan's
a sophisticated executive.

05:18.452 --> 05:21.355
Dad gets mistaken for the cart
collector at the grocery store.

05:21.389 --> 05:23.957
He's got to stop wearing
that red vest

05:23.991 --> 05:27.595
and start remembering
where he parked his car.

05:27.628 --> 05:29.697
Hey, come on, Tom must have
some social skills.

05:29.730 --> 05:30.898
He used to be
regional vice president.

05:30.931 --> 05:33.867
I mean, somehow he managed
to climb the corporate ladder.

05:33.901 --> 05:34.702
He didn't climb.

05:34.735 --> 05:36.737
I put a hand
under each butt cheek

05:36.770 --> 05:37.905
and shoved him up that ladder.

05:37.938 --> 05:39.740
NATHAN:
Wait. So you're saying

05:39.773 --> 05:41.074
that you know how to make
Dad look good?

05:41.108 --> 05:43.644
Sure. It took me a whole
marriage to figure it out,

05:43.677 --> 05:44.878
but I learned how to dress him

05:44.912 --> 05:46.880
and how to steer him
toward his best jokes.

05:46.914 --> 05:49.383
It's basically the technique
that Jim Henson used

05:49.417 --> 05:51.419
to turn a pig into a movie star.

05:54.555 --> 05:55.689
You know what?

05:55.723 --> 05:57.391
This plan could work.

05:57.425 --> 05:59.159
All right, so I'll-I'll tell
Dad, and then we'll figure out

05:59.192 --> 06:00.794
how to switch it up.

06:00.828 --> 06:01.962
No, Tom's the puppet.

06:01.995 --> 06:04.765
You can't tell the puppet
you're pulling the strings.

06:04.798 --> 06:08.602
He'll try to move on his own
and get tangled.

06:08.636 --> 06:10.671
You know, if Mom could
sell Ed on Dad,

06:10.704 --> 06:12.706
you would be the son
of the boss's buddy.

06:12.740 --> 06:14.174
That is not a bad thing.

06:14.207 --> 06:15.876
Yeah, that's true.
It could be perfect.

06:15.909 --> 06:17.745
I mean, I'd be...
I'd be close enough

06:17.778 --> 06:19.847
that he'd want to promote me,
but not so close

06:19.880 --> 06:23.050
that he'd want to try out
his pickup lines on me.

06:23.083 --> 06:25.953
"Nice legs.
What time do they open?"

06:25.986 --> 06:28.155
(laughing)

06:33.894 --> 06:35.863
My God!

06:35.896 --> 06:37.731
(laughing):
What he said...

06:39.066 --> 06:42.069
Oh, God!

06:46.239 --> 06:48.909
Oh, God. I'm sorry.

06:48.942 --> 06:51.545
That would totally work on me.

06:57.951 --> 06:59.887
You know, when someone
gives you a gift,

06:59.920 --> 07:01.855
it's polite to use it.

07:10.063 --> 07:11.699
What's wrong?

07:11.732 --> 07:14.101
I don't know.
My sock is tight.

07:17.137 --> 07:19.172
Nathan, Nathan!

07:19.206 --> 07:21.108
Oh, gosh, my divorced
parents are here.

07:21.141 --> 07:23.477
What are the chances?

07:23.511 --> 07:24.678
Wow, Nate,
what are you doing here?

07:24.712 --> 07:26.580
I was about to ask you
the same question.

07:26.614 --> 07:28.816
Uh, Dad, you know
my boss Ed Dolan.

07:28.849 --> 07:29.683
Hey, Ed. How are you?
Hello, hello.

07:29.717 --> 07:30.784
Oh, your mom said

07:30.818 --> 07:33.654
the Andersons wanted
to meet up here and talk to us.

07:33.687 --> 07:35.923
I hope they're not gonna
ask us to swing again.

07:37.625 --> 07:38.959
I told them the last time,

07:38.992 --> 07:41.829
I don't even like
to share my popcorn.

07:41.862 --> 07:44.164
Right. Um, well, Ed,
why don't you have a seat here

07:44.197 --> 07:46.033
and I'll get us some drinks,
and if the Andersons

07:46.066 --> 07:47.200
don't show up,
we'll just take these seats.

07:47.234 --> 07:48.502
Okay, great.

07:50.738 --> 07:53.040
So sorry to hear
about your divorce.

07:53.073 --> 07:55.042
Oh, thank you.
But you know
what Tom says.

07:55.075 --> 07:57.511
Marriage is like
a three-ring circus.

07:57.545 --> 08:00.213
Engagement ring,
wedding ring and...?

08:00.247 --> 08:01.882
Suffering.

08:01.915 --> 08:02.950
(laughter)

08:02.983 --> 08:05.152
That's good.
Very good.

08:05.185 --> 08:07.988
This guy's got
a million of them!

08:08.021 --> 08:09.923
Tell him the one
about the old couple

08:09.957 --> 08:11.692
having sex on a farm.
Oh, yeah.

08:11.725 --> 08:12.793
This is good.

08:12.826 --> 08:15.062
Nice legs.
What time they open?

08:15.095 --> 08:17.030
(chuckles)

08:18.966 --> 08:21.068
Sorry, that-that works
on my sister.

08:21.101 --> 08:23.103
I...

08:23.136 --> 08:26.840
Not-not that
I've tried it on her.

08:26.874 --> 08:29.176
Hurry, your dad's in the
middle of the farm joke.

08:29.209 --> 08:32.580
So, the old couple is making
love up against the same fence,

08:32.613 --> 08:34.081
arms flailing,
they're screaming.

08:34.114 --> 08:35.649
And the old lady
says to him,

08:35.683 --> 08:38.085
"You didn't do it to me
like that 50 years ago."

08:38.118 --> 08:39.720
And the elderly
husband says,

08:39.753 --> 08:42.289
"Well, 50 years ago, the
fence wasn't electric."

08:42.322 --> 08:44.725
(both laughing)

08:44.758 --> 08:45.993
So, are you set with

08:46.026 --> 08:47.127
a believable excuse
to leave early?

08:47.160 --> 08:48.562
Yeah.
(clears throat)

08:48.596 --> 08:50.063
I'm actually getting
a little help on that.

08:50.097 --> 08:53.033
Which should be here
in three, two, one...

08:53.066 --> 08:55.168
Nathan, I totally
had the date wrong!

08:55.202 --> 08:57.705
My sister's
getting married tonight!

08:57.738 --> 08:59.006
Tonight?!
Tonight!

08:59.039 --> 09:01.041
But I don't have my...
Tux-- it's in the car!

09:01.074 --> 09:02.275
But I'm here with...
Ed-- I know!

09:02.309 --> 09:03.744
Ed, we got to go.
I'm so sorry.

09:03.777 --> 09:05.045
So sorry, Ed.
I'll make it up to you.

09:05.078 --> 09:06.680
I'll make it up
to you right now.

09:06.714 --> 09:07.815
Give it me low and slow.

09:09.082 --> 09:10.150
Ooh.

09:10.183 --> 09:12.052
Slow ten. Groovy.

09:12.085 --> 09:13.186
(laughs)

09:13.220 --> 09:15.689
Speaking of weddings,
Tom, tell him the time you saw

09:15.723 --> 09:18.225
the drunk wedding photographer
in the emergency room.

09:18.258 --> 09:19.593
(laughs): Oh,
that's a good one!

09:19.627 --> 09:21.595
It all started
with me, my cousin

09:21.629 --> 09:23.597
and a donkey who
could do math.

09:23.631 --> 09:25.265
Ooh, I-I love donkey stories.

09:25.298 --> 09:27.701
Well, strap in,
mister, I got six.

09:48.121 --> 09:50.824
(door closes)

09:50.858 --> 09:52.860
(music playing quietly)

09:55.362 --> 09:56.329
(music stops)

09:56.363 --> 09:57.665
Mom.

09:59.667 --> 10:01.669
Mom?

10:04.672 --> 10:05.706
What time is it?

10:05.739 --> 10:07.040
Oh, Mom,
what are you...?

10:07.074 --> 10:09.643
Oh, naked mother!
Naked mother!

10:09.677 --> 10:11.311
Please put lots of clothes on
and meet me downstairs.

10:11.344 --> 10:13.346
You know, your son shouldn't
have to see you like that.

10:13.380 --> 10:14.748
This is why babies
come out crying.

10:16.449 --> 10:18.652
(groans)

10:18.686 --> 10:21.655
I'm so hungover.

10:21.689 --> 10:23.757
Say what you will
about alcoholics,

10:23.791 --> 10:26.760
but they're brave to face
every morning like this.

10:26.794 --> 10:29.697
Sleeping with my boss?

10:29.730 --> 10:31.665
What happened
to our plan?

10:31.699 --> 10:33.400
What happened to Dad?

10:33.433 --> 10:36.303
Please tell me he's not upstairs
with the Andersons.

10:39.740 --> 10:40.874
Your dad got too drunk.

10:40.908 --> 10:43.977
We had to put him in a cab
after he peed in his fedora.

10:44.011 --> 10:45.913
And then?

10:45.946 --> 10:46.780
And then,

10:46.814 --> 10:49.449
Ed asked me if
I wanted to share a cab,

10:49.482 --> 10:51.752
and when the driver asked
where we were headed,

10:51.785 --> 10:54.054
he said, "Bonetown."

10:55.255 --> 10:57.390
I'm sorry, Nathan,
but that's where we went.

10:58.458 --> 11:00.460
We went to Bonetown.

11:00.493 --> 11:02.429
(sighs)

11:02.462 --> 11:05.332
Please tell me you made
a pit stop in Rubberville.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.435
You think I'm happy about this?

11:08.468 --> 11:11.271
You know how stressful it is
to sleep with a bald man?

11:11.304 --> 11:12.940
You have to keep
opening your eyes

11:12.973 --> 11:15.809
to make sure you're kissing
his head and not his ass.

11:15.843 --> 11:17.745
Look, Mom, you
slept with my boss--

11:17.778 --> 11:20.447
a man that I'm trying to move
out of my personal life,

11:20.480 --> 11:21.882
not into my
mother's bed.

11:21.915 --> 11:23.083
And on her floor.

11:23.116 --> 11:24.151
And a little
on this couch.

11:24.184 --> 11:25.385
What?!

11:25.418 --> 11:26.987
Oh, God, this couldn't
get any worse.

11:27.020 --> 11:28.722
Wait. Think about this.

11:28.756 --> 11:30.223
Maybe this isn't a bad thing.

11:30.257 --> 11:31.291
How?

11:31.324 --> 11:33.326
He clearly felt
as awkward as I do,

11:33.360 --> 11:36.396
because he snuck out
without even saying good-bye.

11:36.429 --> 11:38.098
You know what?
Maybe you're right.

11:39.032 --> 11:40.300
Nobody wants to hang out with

11:40.333 --> 11:41.835
the son of
their one-night stand.

11:41.869 --> 11:44.404
If Ed is gonna try
to avoid you,

11:44.437 --> 11:46.139
then he's gonna
avoid me, too.

11:46.173 --> 11:48.341
You actually just
might've fixed this.

11:48.375 --> 11:49.509
You're welcome.
(sighs)

11:49.542 --> 11:50.744
What a relief.

11:50.778 --> 11:52.312
All right,
let's just try to erase

11:52.345 --> 11:54.848
this whole thing from our minds
and pretend it never happened.

11:54.882 --> 11:56.516
I'm gonna go upstairs
and call Crate & Barrel,

11:56.549 --> 11:59.152
see how soon they can get
a new couch in here.

12:00.153 --> 12:02.022
Oh.

12:02.055 --> 12:03.090
Darn it.

12:04.324 --> 12:05.826
You're awake.

12:05.859 --> 12:07.294
I-I wanted to be there
when you...

12:07.327 --> 12:09.863
when you opened
your eyes.

12:09.897 --> 12:11.899
This is what
you would have seen.

12:14.902 --> 12:16.536
Hey, you.

12:16.569 --> 12:19.039
Ed, I thought
you left.

12:19.072 --> 12:21.508
Well, I did. I went to get
some, uh, some things.

12:21.541 --> 12:24.244
I, uh... I want to
cook us breakfast,

12:24.277 --> 12:26.146
and I want to eat
a hard-boiled egg

12:26.179 --> 12:30.117
on every spot we made
sweet love last night.

12:30.150 --> 12:33.086
I got a dozen-- they wouldn't
sell me just three.

12:35.823 --> 12:37.557
What? Oh!

12:37.590 --> 12:38.826
Uh, Nathan.

12:38.859 --> 12:40.293
I didn't, uh,
see you there.

12:40.327 --> 12:41.829
Uh, we need to have a talk.

12:41.862 --> 12:43.163
Okay.

12:43.196 --> 12:45.098
All right, uh,
this is how it is.

12:45.132 --> 12:46.433
(clears throat)

12:46.466 --> 12:48.802
You ever heard of a
place called Bonetown?

12:55.876 --> 12:57.845
Ugh, God. I can't believe
you're telling us

12:57.878 --> 12:59.579
Mom had sex
with your boss.

12:59.612 --> 13:01.815
You know, some things
you keep to yourself.

13:01.849 --> 13:03.516
It's-it's like you had
flu in your house

13:03.550 --> 13:06.586
and you just... you came over
and you sneezed in my mouth.

13:06.619 --> 13:07.587
Why would you trick me?

13:07.620 --> 13:09.589
I thought Ed and I
were getting along great.

13:09.622 --> 13:11.925
And when he gets
those flowers I sent him,

13:11.959 --> 13:14.027
tell him I want them back!

13:14.061 --> 13:16.396
And ask him
not to read the card.

13:18.265 --> 13:19.432
What's the big problem here?

13:19.466 --> 13:21.134
So your mom and your boss
had sex.

13:21.168 --> 13:22.602
My mom and the mailman had sex,

13:22.635 --> 13:24.905
and it didn't change
our relationship one bit.

13:24.938 --> 13:29.409
Except I had to deliver the mail
while he had sex with my mom.

13:29.442 --> 13:31.912
Look, the problem is
it's not just sex.

13:31.945 --> 13:33.246
Ed wants to take Mom

13:33.280 --> 13:34.948
to his beach condo
this weekend.

13:34.982 --> 13:37.450
He-he wants to turn this
into a serious relationship.

13:37.484 --> 13:38.952
Not gonna happen.

13:38.986 --> 13:40.854
I can't be with a bald man.

13:40.888 --> 13:42.890
That's the lowest of the low.

13:42.923 --> 13:45.392
If hair doesn't want
to be on top of him,

13:45.425 --> 13:48.228
why would I?

13:50.563 --> 13:53.633
Okay, why don't you just tell
him you're not interested?

13:53.666 --> 13:55.535
No, no,
look, Debbie,

13:55.568 --> 13:57.304
she can't dump my boss.

13:57.337 --> 13:59.873
He'll get upset and ship me off
to some radio station.

13:59.907 --> 14:02.009
And this is not
a face for radio.

14:02.042 --> 14:04.044
This is a face
that can sell beer,

14:04.077 --> 14:05.612
with a voice that can sell cars,

14:05.645 --> 14:07.380
all wrapped inside a body
that can sell

14:07.414 --> 14:10.450
just about anything
you use in the shower.

14:10.483 --> 14:11.451
Wait.

14:11.484 --> 14:14.021
What if Carol
gets Ed to break up with her?

14:14.054 --> 14:15.222
Yes. Right.

14:15.255 --> 14:16.990
Give him the old
South Side Mall treatment.

14:17.024 --> 14:18.491
Won't work.

14:18.525 --> 14:21.929
He's already been to my mall,
and he shopped till he dropped.

14:23.396 --> 14:25.398
The man likes him some Carol.

14:27.034 --> 14:28.068
He likes first-date Carol.

14:28.101 --> 14:29.970
You got to give him
the full Carol!

14:30.003 --> 14:31.671
Show him the stuff
I had to live with.

14:31.704 --> 14:33.006
Like what?

14:33.040 --> 14:34.107
Like why don't you wear

14:34.141 --> 14:36.409
that giant striped bathrobe
that makes you look like

14:36.443 --> 14:38.511
you're being tented
for termites.

14:41.181 --> 14:41.982
Oh, wait. I know.

14:42.015 --> 14:44.317
Just slurp your soup
in front of him.

14:44.351 --> 14:45.919
(laughter)

14:45.953 --> 14:46.686
I don't slurp.

14:46.719 --> 14:48.188
(laughter)
Sure.

14:48.221 --> 14:49.656
And you don't scream
like the Hulk

14:49.689 --> 14:50.958
when you have night terrors.

14:50.991 --> 14:51.791
(mock screams)

14:53.460 --> 14:54.928
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Why don't you show him

14:54.962 --> 14:55.996
your Sunday night
beauty routine.

14:56.029 --> 14:57.164
She wears so many

14:57.197 --> 14:58.365
beauty products at once,
she looks like...

14:58.398 --> 15:00.167
You?
Hey.

15:00.200 --> 15:01.601
We're making fun
of Mom, not me.

15:01.634 --> 15:03.937
Right, right. Okay.

15:03.971 --> 15:05.939
Oh, no, I know what to do.
I know what to do.

15:05.973 --> 15:07.507
Just do that thing where
the back of your throat itches

15:07.540 --> 15:09.676
and you press in your ear
and you make that goose noise.

15:09.709 --> 15:10.710
(honking)
Yeah.

15:10.743 --> 15:14.281
(honking)

15:14.314 --> 15:16.950
Fine, fine. You want me to be
the South Side Mall,

15:16.984 --> 15:18.351
I'll be the South Side Mall.

15:18.385 --> 15:21.254
But I can't guarantee
it'll make Ed stop liking me.

15:21.288 --> 15:23.056
This...

15:23.090 --> 15:24.958
is a hard habit to break.

15:26.659 --> 15:29.562
I went cold turkey
and I'm fine!

15:32.665 --> 15:36.169
Well... here we are.

15:36.203 --> 15:39.006
Oh, good. There's a couch
for you to sleep on.

15:40.040 --> 15:41.274
Seriously?

15:41.308 --> 15:43.310
I know we got off
to a quick start,

15:43.343 --> 15:45.012
but no more sex
for a while.

15:45.045 --> 15:46.079
I'm a lady.

15:46.113 --> 15:48.048
This trip is going to be
about mental intercourse.

15:49.282 --> 15:52.719
But... this suitcase
is mostly condoms.

15:52.752 --> 15:55.522
I'll be ready to go
to the beach in an hour or so.

15:55.555 --> 15:58.125
Well, we're probably gonna
miss the sunset, but, uh...

15:58.158 --> 16:00.027
no problem.

16:00.060 --> 16:02.062
*

16:02.095 --> 16:04.231
Are you here with me
or the Internet?

16:07.634 --> 16:09.636
(slurping loudly)

16:18.045 --> 16:20.647
(electric buzzing)

16:20.680 --> 16:23.750
I'm doing this for you,
you know.

16:25.518 --> 16:27.054
Thank you.

16:28.255 --> 16:31.024
(snoring)

16:37.797 --> 16:39.666
(Carol screaming)

16:47.174 --> 16:49.176
(slurping loudly)

16:56.649 --> 16:59.186
Don't talk to me
till I've had coffee.

16:59.219 --> 17:00.453
All right.
Let me just...

17:00.487 --> 17:02.455
What did I say?!

17:03.690 --> 17:05.692
(slurping loudly)

17:08.861 --> 17:12.232
See? You look so much
more manly with hair.

17:12.265 --> 17:13.233
Hmm.

17:13.266 --> 17:14.267
Well...

17:15.602 --> 17:17.604
Better than the spaghetti.

17:19.872 --> 17:23.243
(slurping loudly)

17:23.276 --> 17:24.611
(moans)

17:28.348 --> 17:30.417
(clears throat)

17:30.450 --> 17:32.519
Soup makes my throat itch.

17:32.552 --> 17:35.088
(honking)

17:42.395 --> 17:43.230
Oh!

17:43.263 --> 17:45.098
Hey!

17:45.132 --> 17:46.599
How was your weekend? Good?

17:46.633 --> 17:49.802
Your mom is amazing.

17:49.836 --> 17:51.804
It is so great
to finally meet

17:51.838 --> 17:53.573
a woman who lets it
all hang out

17:53.606 --> 17:57.244
and cuts through that...
that phony new relationship BS.

17:57.277 --> 18:00.813
Can you believe
we rode home in silence?

18:00.847 --> 18:02.815
That is so refreshing!

18:04.351 --> 18:05.652
Ed, my other bag
isn't gonna just

18:05.685 --> 18:07.187
walk in here from the car
by itself.

18:07.220 --> 18:09.522
You see? She tells me
exactly what she needs.

18:09.556 --> 18:11.458
Move it, jackass!
That's the stuff!

18:14.427 --> 18:16.463
What did you do?!

18:16.496 --> 18:17.864
Everything I was supposed to.

18:17.897 --> 18:20.633
All the things you complained
about and tons extra.

18:20.667 --> 18:23.336
I told you, this was
a hard habit to break.

18:24.437 --> 18:26.706
He didn't mind the way
that you slurp soup?

18:26.739 --> 18:28.308
No, he smiled and said

18:28.341 --> 18:31.278
he'd like to see what
I could do to a chowder.

18:32.745 --> 18:34.147
I can't believe that
he put up with all that.

18:34.181 --> 18:35.148
I know.

18:35.182 --> 18:36.616
He's the most patient,

18:36.649 --> 18:38.751
good-humored,
accepting man I've ever met.

18:38.785 --> 18:41.221
I don't know
how to get rid of him.

18:42.789 --> 18:44.724
Well, then maybe you shouldn't.

18:44.757 --> 18:45.892
What do you mean?

18:45.925 --> 18:48.928
Well... do you like him, Mom?

18:48.961 --> 18:52.532
Well, he's-he's kind
and very funny.

18:52.565 --> 18:54.534
You should see
his impression of you

18:54.567 --> 18:55.702
looking in the mirror.

18:55.735 --> 18:56.503
(laughs)

18:56.536 --> 18:58.238
(mumbling)

19:01.474 --> 19:02.509
(laughs)

19:02.542 --> 19:04.277
He totally captures your spirit.

19:04.311 --> 19:07.314
Oh, I can't
date your boss.

19:07.347 --> 19:09.849
What if it goes sour
or I break his heart?

19:09.882 --> 19:11.684
It could hurt
your career.

19:11.718 --> 19:14.454
Look, Mom, yes, I'd like
to be an anchorman someday,

19:14.487 --> 19:17.390
but not as much as
I'd like to see you find

19:17.424 --> 19:18.791
somebody that makes you happy.

19:19.892 --> 19:20.927
And who has a house

19:20.960 --> 19:21.961
that you could
eventually move into.

19:21.994 --> 19:24.664
This has a big,
big upside for me.

19:24.697 --> 19:26.866
But he's bald.

19:26.899 --> 19:28.335
So what if he's bald?

19:28.368 --> 19:30.237
This guy saw
the worst parts of you,

19:30.270 --> 19:31.671
things that only
your family knows about,

19:31.704 --> 19:32.839
and he's cool with it.

19:32.872 --> 19:35.542
I think you can put up with
a little shine on his noggin.

19:35.575 --> 19:37.277
He's a good man.

19:37.310 --> 19:40.179
And it's kind of nice to know
he'll never give me lice.

19:41.748 --> 19:42.949
Okay.

19:42.982 --> 19:44.717
Here's the, uh...
here's the last one.

19:44.751 --> 19:46.553
(exhales)

19:46.586 --> 19:47.587
Well, okay.

19:47.620 --> 19:49.222
I'm, uh, gonna be
heading out now.

19:49.256 --> 19:51.224
I'm gonna see a plastic surgeon

19:51.258 --> 19:54.327
about all those problem areas
you circled on me.

19:54.361 --> 19:56.296
Wait, wait.

19:56.329 --> 19:57.564
You had a long drive.

19:57.597 --> 20:00.267
Um... why don't you sit down.

20:00.300 --> 20:01.268
Oh. Oh.
Yeah.

20:01.301 --> 20:04.471
I'll... I'll make
you a drink.

20:04.504 --> 20:06.473
Well, that would be...
that would be lovely.

20:06.506 --> 20:08.975
Uh, as long as it's not
a problem with...

20:09.008 --> 20:10.543
(mumbling)

20:10.577 --> 20:13.346
(laughing)

20:21.554 --> 20:24.291
Just a little speed bump
on the way to Bonetown.

20:41.341 --> 20:43.710
Hey, Miller, I think I got
flowers from your mom.

20:43.743 --> 20:44.577
Wait a...

20:44.611 --> 20:46.579
Wait a minute,
these are from your dad.

20:46.613 --> 20:47.680
Oh, you know what?
Here, let me just...

20:47.714 --> 20:48.515
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

20:48.548 --> 20:52.285
"Roses are red,
violets are blue,

20:52.319 --> 20:54.554
I'm sorry I peed
in your fedora."

20:58.558 --> 21:01.461
Why don't you just
give me those

21:01.494 --> 21:02.329
and we'll pretend
it never happened.

21:02.362 --> 21:03.696
I knew you two
were sleeping together.

21:03.730 --> 21:05.465
You really need
to fill out the forms.

21:05.498 --> 21:05.565
