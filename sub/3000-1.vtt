00:44.710 --> 00:47.910
Good evening. I'm Butt-head.

00:50.625 --> 00:51.717
The movie you are about to see

00:51.859 --> 00:55.090
will be presented using
special 3D technology.

00:55.229 --> 00:56.696
You will see the Jackasses

00:56.831 --> 00:59.595
like no human being
has ever seen them before.

01:01.235 --> 01:03.669
In three dimensions.

01:05.974 --> 01:08.169
In order to experience
this new dimension,

01:08.309 --> 01:11.472
you must put on the special glasses
that you were given in the lobby.

01:13.481 --> 01:15.005
This is gonna be cool.

01:24.792 --> 01:26.851
Doesn't really
look any different, Butt-head.

01:26.995 --> 01:30.897
Whoa! Hey, Beavis,
look at my hand.

01:31.032 --> 01:33.262
It's in 3D.

01:33.401 --> 01:35.335
Really? I don't see...

01:37.505 --> 01:40.269
That's amazing!
It felt like you really hit me!

01:40.408 --> 01:42.899
It's almost like your hand really...

01:43.044 --> 01:45.012
Wow! It's amazing technology!

01:46.280 --> 01:47.508
Wait a second.

01:47.649 --> 01:49.708
So sit back and enjoy the movie.

01:49.851 --> 01:51.910
That was definitely 2D.

01:52.053 --> 01:53.645
Dumb-ass.

03:31.919 --> 03:35.650
Hi, I'm Johnny Knoxville!
Welcome to Jackass.

05:31.105 --> 05:35.007
My name is Johnny Knoxville,
and this is the High Five.

05:37.979 --> 05:41.574
Oh, my goodness. Good morning!

05:42.850 --> 05:44.841
There? All right.

05:44.986 --> 05:46.749
- Fuck.
- Oh, no.

05:50.558 --> 05:52.150
- Yeah, Dunn. What up, brother?
- What's up, nerd?

05:52.293 --> 05:53.624
- Whassup, dude?
- What's up, nerds?

06:06.307 --> 06:08.775
Dude, you played it off so good.

06:08.910 --> 06:11.640
He said, "What's up, Dunn?"

06:15.116 --> 06:16.413
Reset, reset.

06:16.550 --> 06:18.484
Ehren's walking in,
and we're gonna have him bring

06:18.619 --> 06:21.179
in a whole tray full of soup.

06:24.926 --> 06:26.860
- How you doing, guys?
- Pop it in there.

06:26.994 --> 06:29.519
- He's not gonna do it.
- What?

06:29.664 --> 06:31.655
I don't think he's gonna go for it.

06:39.874 --> 06:42.001
- What up, Ehren?
- What's up, dude?

06:42.143 --> 06:44.008
Help us crowd, brother.

06:46.414 --> 06:47.813
He fell for it!

06:54.088 --> 06:56.079
He fell for the soup!

06:59.026 --> 07:01.893
Welcome back, ladies. You got me.

07:02.029 --> 07:03.519
Oh, my God!

07:04.332 --> 07:06.562
Look at the tray!
He broke it in half, dude!

07:08.235 --> 07:10.829
- You can hug me for that.
- The tray broke.

07:12.006 --> 07:15.498
I can't believe he fell for it.
"Can you bring the soup in?"

07:15.643 --> 07:18.612
"We need you to bring this
tray of soup into the kitchen."

07:18.746 --> 07:22.045
This is all flour
for our friend, Bam.

07:22.183 --> 07:25.482
We're gonna antique him
when he gets here.

07:25.619 --> 07:27.917
- Oh, OK.
- He's walking in.

07:29.724 --> 07:31.658
- What's up?
- What up?

07:31.792 --> 07:34.192
Not much. How you been?
High five!

07:51.812 --> 07:53.939
That was the best one so far!

07:54.081 --> 07:57.812
- Oh, my God!
- You guys done kicked my fucking ass.

07:59.687 --> 08:01.018
He got antiqued!

08:05.426 --> 08:08.918
- I was so not ready for that.
- That was so good! You went flying.

08:09.063 --> 08:11.031
- Good morning, man.
- Morning, Bam!

08:11.165 --> 08:13.793
Howdy. Goddamn!

08:15.169 --> 08:17.729
Not too many people knew us
back in our college days,

08:17.872 --> 08:19.601
but, man, we were wild!

08:19.740 --> 08:22.004
I mean, we were having
wet T-shirt contests,

08:22.143 --> 08:24.771
bitchin' summers, body shots...

08:25.980 --> 08:27.242
...cornholin'...

08:28.849 --> 08:32.580
And Johnny Knoxville,
the king of spring break!

08:32.720 --> 08:37.123
Toga! Toga! Toga! Toga! Toga!

08:40.394 --> 08:42.259
I'm Johnny Knoxville.
This is the Jet Ski.

08:54.275 --> 08:55.674
Dude.

08:55.810 --> 08:57.141
Holy shit!

09:03.417 --> 09:06.284
You just barely clipped the top.

09:10.224 --> 09:11.316
He totally landed it.

09:11.459 --> 09:14.986
- How far did I go?
- You went far, man.

09:15.129 --> 09:16.756
I was scared, man.

09:16.897 --> 09:18.626
I've seen a lot of crazy shit
during spring break,

09:18.766 --> 09:19.892
and that took the cake, man.

09:20.034 --> 09:21.968
I didn't exactly stick
the fuckin' landing.

09:22.103 --> 09:23.798
- No. I think you did.
- Yeah, you did!

09:23.938 --> 09:26.304
The king of spring break!

09:33.314 --> 09:36.078
Shit. Dude, I knew
we shouldn't have done this

09:36.217 --> 09:37.775
at my fuckin' dad's house.

09:37.918 --> 09:39.749
He's already pissed about me
fuckin' skipping school.

09:39.887 --> 09:41.286
He's gonna cut me off.

09:42.456 --> 09:44.788
That's coming out of my allowance.

09:55.069 --> 09:57.469
I'm Steve-O... Oh, fuck!

10:02.943 --> 10:05.343
Why do I have to be Steve-O?

10:07.081 --> 10:09.345
- It'll be so quick.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:09.483 --> 10:10.814
You got it.

10:13.888 --> 10:15.947
I'm Steve-O,

10:16.090 --> 10:17.489
and this is Tee Ball.

10:26.734 --> 10:28.292
That was a direct ding-ding hit.

10:34.508 --> 10:36.499
It's only getting worse and worse.

10:40.247 --> 10:43.375
You're the best fielder
I ever saw, Steve-O.

10:43.884 --> 10:45.977
Great job.

10:47.254 --> 10:49.381
Right down the middle.

10:49.523 --> 10:50.717
Line drive.

10:53.260 --> 10:55.353
I'm Dave England,
and this is the Bungee Boogie.

10:58.399 --> 10:59.388
Go.

11:04.205 --> 11:05.502
That was thrilling.

11:05.639 --> 11:08.130
- What the fuck?
- Let's try it again!

11:08.275 --> 11:10.140
Let go.

11:13.280 --> 11:14.508
Shit!

11:18.419 --> 11:21.650
- You OK, dude?
- Yeah, super good.

11:29.096 --> 11:30.324
- Ready?
- OK.

11:37.605 --> 11:39.038
My lip.

12:04.231 --> 12:05.220
- Here we go.
- Tell us when.

12:05.366 --> 12:07.596
- Go ahead.
- Step... go!

12:15.209 --> 12:16.904
That was actually pretty impressive.

12:17.044 --> 12:19.672
I mean, it wasn't a slam,
but it was still pretty impressive.

12:21.715 --> 12:25.048
But this is really impressive.

12:25.819 --> 12:27.684
- Ready?
- This seems dangerous.

12:28.222 --> 12:29.587
And go!

12:39.099 --> 12:41.363
Fuck the helmet,
give me a back brace.

12:42.369 --> 12:44.394
Man, you ate shit!

12:45.806 --> 12:48.604
- Well, that worked.
- I thought you had that.

12:48.742 --> 12:51.233
And go!

12:57.885 --> 13:00.319
Hey! There goes the pool!

13:09.330 --> 13:12.891
Preston. That was awesome.

13:14.335 --> 13:15.893
...start to see me on TV...

13:50.104 --> 13:51.696
How many bees
are we working with here today?

13:51.839 --> 13:54.000
Each hive, probably anywhere
from ten to 50,000 bees.

13:54.141 --> 13:56.632
They are Africanized, so they
will be a little bit more testy.

13:56.777 --> 13:59.439
What do you think the chances are
of these guys getting stung today?

13:59.580 --> 14:02.014
They're gonna get stung.
There's no doubt in my mind.

14:02.149 --> 14:04.140
When you hit a ball full of bees,
you're gonna get stung.

14:04.284 --> 14:07.253
How many bee stings
do you think we can take?

14:07.388 --> 14:10.152
I think it takes about
a hundred to kill a man.

14:10.290 --> 14:13.054
- What?!
- There's 50,000 bees in there.

14:13.193 --> 14:15.058
Did you just make that up, please?

14:15.195 --> 14:17.459
- I don't think I made it up.
- What?!

14:17.598 --> 14:19.156
There's 50,000 per hive.

14:19.299 --> 14:21.460
50,000 and it takes 100 to kill a man?

14:21.602 --> 14:24.196
I think it's about a hundred bees
can kill you, if I'm not mistaken.

14:24.338 --> 14:28.536
- What are we doing here?
- Making a hit movie.

14:28.675 --> 14:31.075
Go for 99 and then take off.

14:37.050 --> 14:38.517
That's gotta piss 'em off too, right,

14:38.652 --> 14:41.553
- just being poured in there?
- Oh, maybe.

14:41.688 --> 14:44.680
I'm starting to think that maybe
this wasn't that good of an idea.

14:44.825 --> 14:46.588
It seemed good on paper.

14:46.727 --> 14:49.093
Look at this.

14:49.229 --> 14:50.890
This is gonna be gnarly now, man.

14:51.031 --> 14:53.966
- Come on, go. Let's go.
- Whoa. No, I'm getting hit.

14:54.101 --> 14:56.365
- Oh, shit.
- Come on, Manny.

14:59.506 --> 15:01.371
Go on! Do it! Do it! Do it!

15:02.109 --> 15:04.168
Do it! Fucking do it!

15:04.311 --> 15:07.906
Got a butt-ton of bees!
My two sexy players,

15:08.048 --> 15:11.142
this is Beehive Tetherball! Game on!

15:12.986 --> 15:14.510
Game on!

15:22.796 --> 15:24.787
Oh, fucking shit!

15:26.533 --> 15:28.262
I can't do it anymore!

15:29.269 --> 15:31.533
Shit! Fuck! Goddamn it!

15:32.539 --> 15:35.440
Fuck! Oh, shit!

15:35.576 --> 15:38.044
He's gonna win!

15:38.178 --> 15:40.271
- Steve-O!
- Fuck!

15:40.414 --> 15:42.814
- Shit! Oh, fuck!
- Stay with Dave. Go with Dave.

15:47.554 --> 15:49.784
Loomis, come retrieve the ball.

15:49.923 --> 15:53.415
Oh, fuck!

15:53.560 --> 15:55.687
Oh, dude, it fucking hurts!

15:57.631 --> 16:00.429
Oh, my God! Oh, fuck!

16:02.769 --> 16:04.566
Please put me somewhere
where there's no bees!

16:04.705 --> 16:07.037
It's the carbon dioxide.

16:07.174 --> 16:10.371
Your body heated up, so they targeted
you, you took it really good, man.

16:10.511 --> 16:12.308
I am so fucking hurt!

16:12.446 --> 16:14.414
You were running around
on carbon dioxide.

16:14.548 --> 16:17.108
- Look at your eye.
- God, I gotta get rid of this.

16:17.651 --> 16:19.084
The thing is that Dave
doesn't understand

16:19.219 --> 16:22.586
is that the more you freak out,
the more you get stung.

16:22.723 --> 16:23.849
Idiot!

17:20.047 --> 17:23.608
That felt like somebody was
blowing a fireball in my face.

17:23.750 --> 17:26.742
It looked like you were
just getting the hell beat out of you.

17:26.887 --> 17:28.354
You can't fucking breathe.

17:47.074 --> 17:50.009
Waiter? Can I get
some cream for my coffee?

18:57.277 --> 19:00.610
That's the story
of Jackass right there.

19:00.747 --> 19:02.374
Just pissing in the wind.

19:12.325 --> 19:14.293
Hey, buddy, would you mind
watching my dog for a second

19:14.428 --> 19:17.556
while I run in there?
Thanks. I'll be right back.

19:17.698 --> 19:19.097
Thank you, buddy.

19:34.214 --> 19:36.375
Thanks, bud.

19:36.516 --> 19:38.484
Thank you very much
for watching my dog.

19:52.833 --> 19:56.667
My name is Johnny Knoxville,
and this is Roller Buffalo.

20:28.502 --> 20:30.367
You're the man!

20:35.509 --> 20:37.807
We're not worthy.

20:43.917 --> 20:47.580
Oh, man. Let me get over here.

20:47.721 --> 20:50.622
- What'd it feel like?
- It felt like shit.

20:52.058 --> 20:54.549
It felt like I got run over
by a buffalo.

21:16.817 --> 21:18.409
It's in my mouth!

21:19.820 --> 21:23.153
Get me out of here! Get me out of here!

21:23.290 --> 21:24.518
Ehren, stay here!

21:28.929 --> 21:30.692
Think we need
to get him out from there?!

21:30.831 --> 21:33.561
Let's get him!
Get it off of him.

21:33.700 --> 21:37.466
- Ehren, stay out!
- All right!

21:37.604 --> 21:39.765
Lance... Hold it together, Lance!

21:42.776 --> 21:45.370
Pull out! OK, pull out! Pull out!

21:49.583 --> 21:52.450
- Did I get the shot?
- You got the shot, dude.

21:52.586 --> 21:54.383
So it went high and everything?
It was like a volcano?

21:54.521 --> 21:56.148
You got a good three feet.

21:56.289 --> 21:58.723
- Three foot?
- Yeah, that one had some power.

21:58.859 --> 22:01.987
- It was like a full-on volcano?
- Absolutely.

22:08.468 --> 22:09.730
Don't say anything.

22:17.811 --> 22:21.008
- What would your flavors be?
- Two Budweisers.

22:24.885 --> 22:26.477
What do I owe you?

22:26.620 --> 22:28.884
Six-fifty, please.

22:29.022 --> 22:31.354
- Keep the change.
- Thank you, dear.

22:31.491 --> 22:34.187
- Cheers. Boop!
- Cheers.

22:35.395 --> 22:36.987
So what's the status?

22:37.130 --> 22:41.157
I don't know. Go down to the beach
or something... hit the water.

22:43.403 --> 22:44.529
You tried it?

22:44.671 --> 22:48.767
Tara! What the fuck are you doing?

22:51.478 --> 22:53.537
What the fuck?!

22:53.680 --> 22:55.648
- Who the fuck are you?
- Who are you?

22:55.782 --> 22:57.841
I'm her frickin' boyfriend, asshole!

22:57.984 --> 23:00.509
That's cool, bud. I'm her man-friend.

23:00.654 --> 23:03.452
Dude, don't push me. Don't push me.

23:03.590 --> 23:04.852
I'm not even touching you.

23:04.991 --> 23:07.516
You know, fuck both of you!
Fuck both of you!

23:07.661 --> 23:08.719
Calm down now.

23:09.629 --> 23:11.187
So...

23:12.532 --> 23:15.660
He and I are taking a break and...

23:18.805 --> 23:20.534
Right in here.

23:21.141 --> 23:22.369
Right in here.

23:22.509 --> 23:26.172
Fuck you! I told you
to get the fuck away!

23:26.313 --> 23:30.682
- Don't push him, man!
- Stop! Stop! Stop!

23:30.817 --> 23:32.079
Get your ass down!

23:33.286 --> 23:35.846
Keep your punk ass down,
you hunk of shit!

23:35.989 --> 23:38.549
Get him, Pop! Get him, Poppy!

23:39.693 --> 23:41.490
Get his ass down!

23:41.628 --> 23:43.220
Get off of him! Stop!

23:45.699 --> 23:49.567
Police! Get on the fucking ground!
Get on the ground!

23:49.703 --> 23:51.796
Freeze! Everybody up against the wall!

23:51.938 --> 23:54.805
- Up against the wall!
- Get the fuck off me!

23:54.941 --> 23:56.772
What the fuck are you doing?!

23:56.910 --> 23:59.606
Get him up. Get him up!

23:59.746 --> 24:02.579
Freeze, motherfucker!
Get your hands behind your back!

24:03.717 --> 24:06.845
- Let's go, babe!
- Fucking get off me!

24:06.987 --> 24:09.717
Code 54! Paramedic! Paramedic!

24:09.856 --> 24:13.019
Get the fuck off me!
Get him off me!

24:13.159 --> 24:16.595
- Get the fuck off me!
- Shut up! Shut up!

24:16.730 --> 24:18.254
Look at them two.

24:22.268 --> 24:25.260
Big boy. Wait. He can walk?

24:25.939 --> 24:27.133
OK.

24:30.410 --> 24:34.039
What was that all that about?
What the hell was all that about?

24:35.281 --> 24:38.773
I don't know! A bunch of midgets
come in here and start fighting!

24:38.918 --> 24:43.150
- I don't know what happened.
- That was wild!

24:43.289 --> 24:45.655
The cops came in!
I can't believe it.

24:45.792 --> 24:47.692
Little miniature cops.

24:54.768 --> 24:56.633
Here comes Dunn.

25:17.057 --> 25:19.924
No fucking way, dude!

25:21.728 --> 25:24.993
- Oh, my God.
- Is there blue on me?

25:25.131 --> 25:26.530
I am so happy.

25:26.666 --> 25:29.533
- There's a lot of blue.
- Dude, that thing goes!

25:34.007 --> 25:35.065
Fuck!

25:37.677 --> 25:40.510
Dude, the sound of it
is just fucking terrifying.

25:40.647 --> 25:43.343
This sucks. Oh, man.

25:48.621 --> 25:51.215
Its bark is worse than its bite, Ehren.

25:52.859 --> 25:54.918
Due to prison overpopulation,

25:55.061 --> 25:57.461
we're gonna give these boys
here a chance to escape.

25:57.597 --> 26:01.226
This side represents incarceration,
that side, freedom.

26:01.367 --> 26:03.961
This is Electric Avenue.

26:05.638 --> 26:09.233
Each one of these
stun guns has 950,000 volts.

26:09.375 --> 26:13.334
There's 15 of 'em hanging here, plus
four cattle prods. Good luck, fellas!

26:13.480 --> 26:15.243
Go!

26:15.381 --> 26:17.679
- Go, go, go!
- Fuck!

26:17.817 --> 26:20.786
Fuck, I'm gonna pass out, man.
I'm gonna fucking pass out.

26:20.920 --> 26:22.444
Come on, come on.

26:25.258 --> 26:26.589
Go, go, go!

26:37.036 --> 26:38.435
Fuck, that sucked!

26:40.507 --> 26:41.531
Fuck!

26:49.082 --> 26:50.208
Sucks doody!

27:02.262 --> 27:06.528
- How do you feel?
- I changed my mind.

27:06.666 --> 27:09.931
Stun guns are the number one
most thing that I hate now.

27:10.069 --> 27:12.162
Bulls are second, snakes are third.

27:12.305 --> 27:14.796
That sucked! Terribly.

27:25.718 --> 27:28.881
I'm Preston Lacy here
with pro kicker Josh Brown,

27:29.022 --> 27:30.284
and this is the Field Goal.

27:45.205 --> 27:46.331
Kick!

27:47.941 --> 27:49.875
Wow, that was a good kick.

27:50.009 --> 27:52.944
- Was that right in the puss?
- Right on the kisser.

27:56.883 --> 27:58.748
Oh, fuck.

27:58.885 --> 27:59.943
My mouth.

28:00.086 --> 28:01.212
Fuck!

28:07.093 --> 28:09.084
- I love you, buddy. Thank you.
- Oh, my God.

28:11.231 --> 28:14.962
Pro football star Josh Brown.
I love you, buddy. Right here.

28:15.101 --> 28:16.295
Fucking A!

28:16.436 --> 28:18.370
- On the mouth.
- You're a man.

28:21.074 --> 28:23.269
April, what kind of glue is this?

28:23.409 --> 28:27.106
- Super Mighty Glue.
- This is Super Mighty Glue,

28:27.247 --> 28:29.681
and we're going to have
a little fun with it today.

28:30.617 --> 28:32.608
Who's got tummy hair?

28:32.752 --> 28:34.219
Not me.

28:35.888 --> 28:38.379
- You have tummy hair?
- I have a fraction.

28:41.794 --> 28:43.921
- That's definitely tummy hair.
- That's tummy hair.

28:45.198 --> 28:47.359
- You guys got tummy hair.
- Now we're talking.

28:47.500 --> 28:51.300
Looks like we got cast for this bit.

28:51.437 --> 28:53.837
- Don't get it on his fingers.
- You don't need a lot, they say.

28:53.973 --> 28:58.069
A dab'll do ya.
Oh, Knoxville, Jesus!

28:58.211 --> 28:59.974
No, I think this is gonna work.

29:00.113 --> 29:01.978
All right. We ready?

29:02.115 --> 29:03.104
Ready, then?

29:03.783 --> 29:05.774
Oh, my God!

29:05.918 --> 29:08.443
Now. Oh, my God!

29:08.588 --> 29:10.317
Keep it on there. Keep it on.
Keep it on there.

29:10.456 --> 29:11.980
Dude, it's gonna take my skin off.

29:12.125 --> 29:13.990
You're gonna have hairy palms.

29:15.895 --> 29:17.556
Wait. I kind of like it
when Preston says...

29:17.697 --> 29:19.460
Fuck!

29:21.534 --> 29:25.129
- It's not moving.
- What do you like Preston to say?

29:27.406 --> 29:29.533
Get a little symphony going.

29:38.084 --> 29:39.574
Dude, this is in.

29:39.719 --> 29:41.084
Should they pull it?

29:41.220 --> 29:43.154
We don't need any more time, dude.
It is in.

29:43.289 --> 29:45.883
You got at least 15 grams of super glue.

29:46.025 --> 29:47.322
- Pull it! Pull it!
- Really?

29:47.460 --> 29:50.020
- Three, two, one...
- Skin's coming, I know it. Go, Bam!

29:58.738 --> 30:00.296
He's a werewolf!

30:00.439 --> 30:01.428
Werewolf!

30:05.444 --> 30:08.311
That is mingin'-ass Phil's.

30:08.447 --> 30:12.042
Preston's is pretty gross,
but that is disgusting!

30:14.720 --> 30:16.347
Wow!

30:23.129 --> 30:25.962
No, don't pour that
on your boo-boo hand.

30:37.076 --> 30:39.806
- It stings.
- That's gotta hurt.

30:39.946 --> 30:42.972
Hey, Dunn. Do you have
any hair on your butt?

30:43.115 --> 30:45.640
- No.
- Do you want some?

30:45.785 --> 30:48.345
I'm thinking I'm about
due for a hairy ass, yeah.

30:48.487 --> 30:50.751
I'm in my 30s, it hasn't
grown in natural yet.

30:50.890 --> 30:52.255
So I think we're gonna
have to do a transplant.

30:52.391 --> 30:54.325
Phil, can I borrow
some of your back hair?

30:54.460 --> 30:56.394
Yeah, like having you
sit on my back?

30:56.529 --> 30:58.258
I'm thinking about
becoming a real man.

30:58.397 --> 31:00.092
Sure, I'll lay down
and you can sit on it.

31:00.233 --> 31:02.861
- OK, Rake.
- You ready to go? Let's do it.

31:03.002 --> 31:04.629
Ryan, do you shave your ass?

31:04.770 --> 31:08.467
Shave my... Look at me!
Do I shave my ass?

31:08.608 --> 31:10.405
I don't know
what a razor feels like.

31:10.543 --> 31:12.841
Apparently, you don't know what
toilet paper feels like either.

31:12.979 --> 31:15.140
- I don't!
- Make sure it's clean.

31:15.281 --> 31:16.873
All right, go, go, go!
You gotta sit!

31:17.016 --> 31:19.484
- Sit! Sit! Sit!
- Sit down.

31:24.523 --> 31:26.616
Time it, two minutes
on the clock.

31:28.628 --> 31:30.528
- Phil, you all right down there?
- Yeah.

31:30.663 --> 31:33.097
- Consider this a bonding experience.
- Okay.

31:33.232 --> 31:34.563
You got about 30 seconds.

31:34.700 --> 31:36.691
Well, if I can't get
Phil's hair off of me,

31:36.836 --> 31:40.431
then, you know, I'd really
rather prefer a ZZ Top beard.

31:45.344 --> 31:48.745
Fucking asshole!
You dickhead!

31:49.248 --> 31:51.409
- That's not gonna come off.
- No fucking shit!

31:51.550 --> 31:53.108
That's not gonna come off.

31:53.252 --> 31:55.777
It's going to come off.
It's going to come off.

31:58.791 --> 32:01.385
You fucking, fucking pricks.

32:01.527 --> 32:04.052
- Okay, Dunn, stand up.
- Dunn, you're up. Stand up.

32:04.196 --> 32:05.493
Let's see if you got
some hair on your butt.

32:05.631 --> 32:07.963
- Ready? Go.
- One, two...

32:11.871 --> 32:14.396
- What the hell?
- Your butt looks 80 years old.

32:14.540 --> 32:17.976
- Does it?
- Somebody should iron you.

32:18.110 --> 32:20.169
- Look at Phil's back.
- Let me see.

32:20.313 --> 32:22.406
Man, you're missing
a lot of hair in there.

32:22.548 --> 32:24.038
But no doo-doo stains, right?

32:24.183 --> 32:25.616
- No.
- Not so much.

32:25.751 --> 32:26.809
All right, good.

32:26.953 --> 32:28.716
Why'd you grip it like that?

32:28.854 --> 32:31.721
Why you biting off of Preston's steez
by going...?

32:35.227 --> 32:36.956
Wait a minute, hold
those scissors down.

32:37.096 --> 32:40.554
Oh, you son of a bitch.

32:40.700 --> 32:42.759
I have a free hand.

32:45.671 --> 32:47.298
Hello!

32:48.007 --> 32:50.373
- Here, I'll be like this to catch him.
- All right, you catch him.

32:50.509 --> 32:51.908
Ryan, do you want
your pants up, first?

32:52.044 --> 32:54.376
Catch me. Catch Knox.

32:54.513 --> 32:56.708
- Grab Bam.
- No, keep your pants down.

32:56.849 --> 33:00.649
- I don't want my balls hanging out.
- Ready then? Three...

33:00.786 --> 33:02.481
Man, this is gonna suck.

33:02.621 --> 33:04.987
Three, two, go.

33:09.161 --> 33:13.393
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

33:14.233 --> 33:16.599
Fuck me, man.

33:18.204 --> 33:19.831
What a bunch of dicks.

33:19.972 --> 33:21.701
That's worse than Phil.

33:23.709 --> 33:26.075
All right.
Wee Man, what are you doing?

33:26.212 --> 33:28.077
You take the cake, bub.

33:28.214 --> 33:30.079
You won't come out that easy.

33:30.216 --> 33:33.276
Why don't you want to glue
Wee Man to Preston?

33:36.222 --> 33:38.816
- Yes.
- I should lay down,

33:38.958 --> 33:40.619
and you should lay down on top of me.

33:40.760 --> 33:43.024
- Woof.
- Going right for it.

33:43.162 --> 33:44.390
Like this?

33:45.398 --> 33:47.696
- I think like this.
- No.

33:51.971 --> 33:53.700
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

33:53.839 --> 33:56.467
- A 69.
- Glued into 69.

33:56.609 --> 33:58.702
I think that's the best way.

33:59.845 --> 34:02.473
Well, fucking lube him up
or lube me up!

34:02.615 --> 34:04.708
- Let's go!
- Where's the glue?

34:12.591 --> 34:14.581
- That's good.
- OK, OK, OK!

34:14.726 --> 34:16.126
- Knoxville!
- Sorry.

34:16.262 --> 34:18.127
Asshole!

34:18.264 --> 34:20.664
We're really bros now.

34:20.800 --> 34:22.995
You should see it from where I'm at.

34:24.469 --> 34:25.902
Oh, no.

34:28.007 --> 34:31.966
Hold it. Two minutes!
Someone time it.

34:32.110 --> 34:36.047
Two minutes is the longest
69 I've ever fuckin' done!

34:36.181 --> 34:39.743
- How do you plan on un-69-ing?
- I have no fucking idea.

34:39.885 --> 34:43.047
- I got an idea how to get him off.
- Slide them down the table, this way.

34:43.188 --> 34:44.315
- No!
- What?

34:45.056 --> 34:47.116
No, don't... Nicely.

34:47.259 --> 34:49.022
Somebody go get me the stun gun.

34:49.161 --> 34:50.628
No!

34:50.763 --> 34:53.197
Yeah! Go get it! Get the stun gun!

34:53.331 --> 34:55.994
I'm pulling off!
I'm pulling off! No! No! No!

34:56.135 --> 34:58.763
That's not fucking cool! No, no!

35:01.774 --> 35:02.900
Fuck!

35:05.044 --> 35:07.308
Look at my fucking nipple!

35:09.915 --> 35:14.648
My fucking armpit kills!
Phil, pull it off.

35:14.787 --> 35:18.655
- For real? Where, here?
- What's this from?

35:18.791 --> 35:20.122
I can't. Let Ap do it.

35:20.259 --> 35:23.558
- Yank it off.
- Ready, ready, ready...

35:23.996 --> 35:24.985
Stop that.

35:25.631 --> 35:27.462
I think that's it for Super Mighty Glue.

35:27.499 --> 35:29.023
I think that's it for Super Mighty Glue.

35:29.168 --> 35:32.069
Thank God none of us had that
foreskin you were talking about.

35:33.939 --> 35:35.736
Does anyone have foreskin?

35:35.874 --> 35:37.899
Anybody. Now's the time
to raise your hand.

35:38.043 --> 35:39.032
Yeah.

35:40.913 --> 35:42.574
Three, two, one, go!

36:43.175 --> 36:45.006
Chicas.

36:48.447 --> 36:50.574
Sorry. I hit my wrong button.

37:05.197 --> 37:07.188
Give me my leg! Help!

37:08.434 --> 37:10.129
Give me my leg!

37:10.269 --> 37:14.137
That mutt's got my leg! Stop! Thief!

37:14.273 --> 37:15.672
- Hey!
- Where you going?

37:25.984 --> 37:27.451
Oh, God.

37:36.094 --> 37:39.757
I went to the bathroom.
I have to change.

37:47.072 --> 37:50.200
Run, run, run
run, run, run, run!

37:50.342 --> 37:52.810
Run, run, run, run, run!

37:54.146 --> 37:55.807
Hey, man.
What are you doing, man?

37:55.948 --> 38:00.749
I messed myself. I messed myself.

38:00.886 --> 38:03.354
- Can you help me?
- Hell, no. You going to clean it?

38:03.489 --> 38:06.947
I'm cleaning it!
If you'll get off my case.

38:08.494 --> 38:10.758
Hello. My name is Irving Zisman.

38:10.896 --> 38:12.955
This is my grandson, Murray,

38:13.098 --> 38:16.158
and today, we're
going to go buy a scooter.

38:20.372 --> 38:22.499
Wow, what a lovely place.

38:26.378 --> 38:29.006
Good selection.

38:30.549 --> 38:33.916
- How you doing, sir?
- Good. I'm with my grandson.

38:34.052 --> 38:35.212
- Oh, very nice.
- Yeah.

38:35.354 --> 38:38.323
- How much does this cost?
- That's running about $2,000.

38:38.457 --> 38:40.948
Two thousand?
What'd I do, break something?

38:42.227 --> 38:43.251
My goodness.

38:43.395 --> 38:45.260
What were you looking at
over there, Murray?

38:45.397 --> 38:47.126
Just a couple of bikes down there.

38:47.266 --> 38:50.258
Tell me a little bit
about this one here.

38:50.402 --> 38:52.802
This is nice. I'll put it back.

38:52.938 --> 38:54.428
- I'll be right back.
- OK.

39:08.921 --> 39:10.445
Holy shit!

39:16.828 --> 39:20.423
Fuck. Did I hit the wrong button?

39:20.566 --> 39:23.296
What happened? Are you OK?

39:23.435 --> 39:25.232
Sir, would you like me
to call the paramedics?

39:25.370 --> 39:26.894
No, I'm fine!

39:27.039 --> 39:29.906
- What happened?
- The old dude just took off.

39:31.577 --> 39:35.308
Some guy just fuckin'
went through the thing.

39:35.447 --> 39:38.041
How'd he come through here?
He came through here?

39:39.117 --> 39:40.414
He went out that way.

39:40.552 --> 39:42.019
How'd he go out that way?

39:46.491 --> 39:48.220
I think he's all right.

39:49.328 --> 39:50.590
Oh, my goodness.

39:58.470 --> 40:00.131
Up yours!

40:04.610 --> 40:06.942
I'm Pontius the Barbarian,

40:07.079 --> 40:09.377
and now the day has come
to slay the foul beast,

40:09.514 --> 40:11.482
the devil's brethren.

40:16.088 --> 40:19.615
Come, beast. Come meet your doom.

40:23.362 --> 40:26.354
Oh, you sour beast!

40:30.636 --> 40:33.628
You swine of the darkness!

40:33.772 --> 40:36.366
I've long awaited
this blood orgy, you...

40:38.510 --> 40:40.501
Fool! More!

40:41.513 --> 40:43.105
Fool! He's got me!

40:50.122 --> 40:52.647
Fuck! Goddamn it, get me out of here!

40:53.759 --> 40:54.919
Fuck!

40:55.060 --> 40:57.051
Dude, fuck this shit.

40:59.998 --> 41:02.398
- What happened?
- I'm fucking over it.

41:06.204 --> 41:09.264
- It got you good right here.
- I know, it got me good a lot.

41:11.543 --> 41:13.977
You got bit and stung,
so mission accomplished.

41:14.112 --> 41:16.273
I'm fucking pissed.

41:16.415 --> 41:18.815
What'd you think
was going to happen?

41:22.220 --> 41:24.484
Up a little. Yeah, right there.

41:27.492 --> 41:29.960
Oh, shit.

41:33.899 --> 41:36.629
We're here with BMX legend
Mat Hoffman,

41:36.768 --> 41:38.599
and this is a Sweatsuit Cocktail.

41:51.650 --> 41:54.813
So I guess the idea is
for the sweat to dribble down

41:54.953 --> 41:59.515
into the funnel, into the cup.
That's rinky-dink, even for us.

41:59.658 --> 42:02.286
That's coming right out of the ass.

42:03.395 --> 42:06.523
We probably need a doctor.

42:08.767 --> 42:10.257
You almost have a drop.

42:10.402 --> 42:12.529
Man, it's fucking hot in this!

42:13.305 --> 42:15.136
Steve-O, face.

42:15.273 --> 42:17.104
- What's that?
- Face.

42:17.242 --> 42:18.937
Looks like white gravy.

42:19.077 --> 42:21.204
Sop his face.
Bring the cup down a little bit.

42:23.982 --> 42:26.473
- Get it, get it!
- Oh, shit!

42:26.618 --> 42:30.349
- Is that pee-pee or sweat?
- It's sweat, dude. Get it!

42:30.489 --> 42:32.548
Wring that out, Steve-O.

42:35.961 --> 42:37.826
We're losing Lance, guys.

42:37.963 --> 42:39.430
What?

42:40.799 --> 42:43.029
What is...? His head's bobbing.

42:43.168 --> 42:47.571
Lance, you all right?
I think we just broke him again.

42:54.179 --> 42:55.510
You OK?

42:55.647 --> 42:58.673
- You need the camera?
- Yeah...

42:58.817 --> 43:00.512
- The camera help you not get sick?
- Yeah, I'm...

43:00.652 --> 43:02.779
All right, give him the camera so he...

43:02.921 --> 43:04.218
Got it? You good?

43:07.492 --> 43:10.120
Hey, someone follow me down the crack.

43:15.066 --> 43:18.058
OK, here we go.

43:18.203 --> 43:21.604
Steve-O! Steve-O! Lord!

43:21.740 --> 43:23.469
Sorry! Sorry.

43:25.610 --> 43:28.078
A prostate exam going on back there.

43:28.213 --> 43:30.340
Fuck sake, dude.

43:32.617 --> 43:35.609
Here, let's take this shit off
and wring out the suit.

43:37.823 --> 43:40.155
That makes me want to puke.

43:41.159 --> 43:44.094
This is the first cocktail
you've had in two years, right?

43:44.229 --> 43:46.720
Yeah. Here's to good health.

43:48.633 --> 43:50.498
Chug that whole thing, Steve-O.

44:02.647 --> 44:04.444
I think the cam...

44:06.785 --> 44:09.049
Don't puke on that heater.

44:09.187 --> 44:10.518
You're puking on...

44:10.655 --> 44:13.522
Give me your camera.
You're puking right on your lens.

44:17.262 --> 44:19.127
Here, we gotta like...

44:28.406 --> 44:31.842
We're really falling apart here.

44:31.977 --> 44:34.571
- Jesus.
- I love you, bro.

44:34.713 --> 44:36.704
He just puked all over his camera.

44:36.848 --> 44:39.146
That was the Sweatsuit Cocktail.

44:39.284 --> 44:41.343
- Seriously.
- Yeah, brother.

44:42.687 --> 44:44.348
My name is Santy Claus,

44:44.489 --> 44:48.118
and I'm here with the Dudesons,
and this is the Christmas Tree.

44:48.260 --> 44:49.249
Timber!

44:49.394 --> 44:52.420
- Santa and elf is coming down hard.
- Yes!

44:54.165 --> 44:57.328
Santa ain't climbed a tree
in quite a while.

44:57.469 --> 45:00.870
And, I am gonna be honest,
Santa did have a couple last night.

45:01.006 --> 45:04.737
So... this ain't gonna feel too good.

45:04.876 --> 45:06.901
I'm just here to enjoy the ride.

45:07.045 --> 45:09.172
How do you get started?

45:09.314 --> 45:11.509
- You need a hand?
- F, yes! Santa needs a hand.

45:11.650 --> 45:14.414
I just love that they're
climbing up a 40-foot tree,

45:14.552 --> 45:16.713
and they're gonna have
a 60-foot drop and it's

45:16.855 --> 45:19.449
- the top of the morning.
- Top of the morning to you!

45:19.591 --> 45:23.459
- Santa looking good!
- Santa's fucking tired.

45:25.363 --> 45:27.729
Santa can barely hold on,
so let's go.

45:29.234 --> 45:32.761
That was the hard part!
Now comes the easy part.

45:32.904 --> 45:34.462
Bring out the saw!

45:40.946 --> 45:42.937
They're letting Jarppi
work the chainsaw.

45:43.081 --> 45:44.844
He's never touched a chainsaw before.

45:44.983 --> 45:48.612
He's got one thumb.
How's he gonna hit the trigger?

45:48.753 --> 45:50.744
He's gonna have no thumbs after this.

45:51.790 --> 45:53.883
You ever get scared in these moments?

45:54.893 --> 45:55.882
Yeah.

45:56.027 --> 45:59.360
Push it! Push it the other way!

45:59.497 --> 46:01.692
Jarppi, cut out!

46:01.833 --> 46:03.494
Yeah, but you got to push!

46:03.635 --> 46:05.500
There it goes, there it goes!

46:05.637 --> 46:07.502
Timber!

46:12.677 --> 46:13.837
Fuck!

46:15.513 --> 46:17.572
Santa's coming out!
Are you all right?

46:19.651 --> 46:22.449
I fell on the tree... on my ass!

46:22.587 --> 46:24.179
- You fell on the tree?
- Yeah.

46:24.756 --> 46:26.087
But you're alive.

46:27.926 --> 46:30.520
You good?

46:30.662 --> 46:35.690
Santa, I think that's the only proper
way to get yourself a Christmas tree.

46:35.834 --> 46:37.665
With all that sleigh riding I do,

46:37.802 --> 46:40.464
Santa really doesn't like heights,
I found out.

46:43.608 --> 46:46.839
I'm Danger Ehren, and this
is Pin the Tail on the Donkey.

46:51.116 --> 46:52.105
You got it.

46:52.250 --> 46:55.549
Let me spin you around.
Spin you around.

46:58.189 --> 47:00.657
OK. Spread your legs.

47:03.228 --> 47:04.286
Tail up higher.

47:11.069 --> 47:12.696
- Where'd he hit you?
- It didn't.

47:12.837 --> 47:14.634
Where the fuck
do you think it hit me?

47:14.773 --> 47:16.570
Look, damn it!

47:17.609 --> 47:19.372
Put that tail on that donkey.

47:19.511 --> 47:21.706
OK, it's just a donkey.

47:26.851 --> 47:28.512
Spread legs... spread legs.

47:28.653 --> 47:30.211
That's good.

47:30.355 --> 47:31.652
Get your dick lower.

47:33.458 --> 47:36.256
You're going good. Spread legs.

47:36.394 --> 47:38.055
Your walk is just amazing.

47:40.465 --> 47:41.932
Straight, straight.

47:43.134 --> 47:45.329
You're getting warm.

47:49.908 --> 47:51.170
I heard that.

47:54.379 --> 47:57.974
It got me in the dick!
It got me in the dick!

47:58.116 --> 48:00.346
I see the hoofprint on his ding-ding.

48:02.954 --> 48:06.617
Fuck! I don't want to do that
anymore, if that's OK.

48:38.723 --> 48:40.122
Hello...

48:40.258 --> 48:41.657
Hello. My name is Johnny Knoxville.

48:41.793 --> 48:46.355
We have professional football
players Erik Ainge, Jared Allen,

48:46.498 --> 48:50.195
and our referee today,
Seann William Scott.

48:50.335 --> 48:51.700
This is the Blindside.

48:57.876 --> 49:00.174
- I didn't do it, Wee Man.
- I know.

49:00.311 --> 49:02.404
I didn't do it.
Jared, why did you do that?

49:02.547 --> 49:05.038
I really got lost in the moment.

49:05.183 --> 49:07.048
Let's get this shit over with.

49:13.825 --> 49:15.918
Blue... 24!

49:16.060 --> 49:18.051
Blue... 24! Hut!

49:22.333 --> 49:23.561
Oh, my God.

49:31.709 --> 49:33.939
Looks like you didn't
block him, Preston.

49:34.078 --> 49:37.707
You just planted me
in the fucking ground!

49:40.385 --> 49:41.784
That felt like shit.

49:42.386 --> 49:45.116
Have you ever played
linebacker before?

49:45.256 --> 49:47.986
- Years and years ago.
- You think you can give it a try?

49:49.527 --> 49:51.586
Quickly review. What's your job?

49:51.729 --> 49:53.458
Murder Knoxville's face.

49:54.899 --> 49:57.333
- What's your job?
- Catch the ball.

49:57.468 --> 49:59.265
- I mean...
- Let's do this!

49:59.403 --> 50:00.734
I mean, catch the ball.

50:00.871 --> 50:02.600
Do you think Knoxville's
gonna catch the ball?

50:02.740 --> 50:04.207
- Nope.
- Who gives a shit?

50:08.412 --> 50:11.609
Hey, Jared! Don't hit me
with your purse this time!

50:15.653 --> 50:17.780
Nice wristband, douche.

50:20.124 --> 50:21.284
Ten hut!

50:33.170 --> 50:34.467
Did I catch it?

50:34.605 --> 50:37.096
People don't realize
football's a game of physics.

50:37.241 --> 50:39.072
Speed and velocity equals that.

50:46.483 --> 50:50.180
- Good game. See you in the showers.
- Good game. See you in the showers.

50:52.923 --> 50:54.652
Oh, fuck!

50:56.594 --> 50:58.789
That was perfect. That was perfect.

51:00.631 --> 51:04.226
This is our friend, Will,
and he has a very special bottom.

51:12.743 --> 51:14.472
Dude, you are one mingin' machine.

51:14.612 --> 51:17.012
You ready? All right,
come on, dude, let's party.

51:35.332 --> 51:37.892
- What about the trumpet?
- All right. Here he goes.

51:38.035 --> 51:40.299
You're bringing jazz back
to the working man.

51:48.045 --> 51:50.707
- We're on to something here.
- That's talent!

51:52.483 --> 51:54.348
Hey, bud, dude,
can I bum a smoke?

51:59.823 --> 52:01.188
Wait.

52:10.668 --> 52:12.260
Bottoms up.

52:16.807 --> 52:18.798
There's shit on the end...

52:22.112 --> 52:23.306
Is there shit on the end?

52:23.447 --> 52:25.472
- There's shit on there.
- Hey, look at this shit.

52:31.555 --> 52:33.819
I saw it.

52:37.728 --> 52:40.720
- That's fucking gross.
- Dude, that was fucking mingin'.

52:42.299 --> 52:44.028
Let's get out the dart gun.

52:44.168 --> 52:46.693
- Yeah.
- There you go.

52:46.837 --> 52:50.238
Luckily, we had it handy.

52:50.374 --> 52:53.673
- Do you want to practice?
- Let's get a balloon.

52:53.811 --> 52:56.837
- Does it need to go down lower?
- Yeah, go lower.

52:58.048 --> 52:59.743
You got it. You got it.

52:59.883 --> 53:01.441
You might want to tuck
your nuts up.

53:01.585 --> 53:05.817
No, no, no! I think you should leave
your legs just a little agape.

53:05.956 --> 53:08.356
Steve-O, don't get your balls
in the way. You'll hurt 'em.

53:10.094 --> 53:11.220
- Is this sucking in?
- Yeah, he's sucking in.

53:11.829 --> 53:15.230
- Trippin' out.
- I'm seriously trippin'.

53:15.366 --> 53:17.766
You wanna try the longer... Hey!

53:29.313 --> 53:32.407
My name's Johnny Knoxville
and this is Bad Dog.

53:38.055 --> 53:40.250
Oklahoma! Oklahoma!

53:41.859 --> 53:42.951
Fuck!

53:43.727 --> 53:45.388
Oh, my ass meat!

53:55.272 --> 53:58.105
That dog... is athletic.

53:59.910 --> 54:01.104
My ass hurts.

54:01.812 --> 54:05.646
Lance, can you tell
I've been doing squats?

54:05.783 --> 54:08.411
You know, I couldn't
have done this on the first...

54:09.286 --> 54:11.277
...two movies, because

54:11.422 --> 54:14.357
I never really did squats
or anything then,

54:14.491 --> 54:17.153
but now I've been really
working out my butt and legs,

54:17.294 --> 54:20.559
and it gave the dog
something to bite on.

54:20.697 --> 54:22.927
Pretty good something
to bite on, if you ask me.

54:23.066 --> 54:24.727
Yeah.

54:26.537 --> 54:29.199
I'm Chris Pontius,
and this is the Helicockter.

54:35.579 --> 54:37.308
Oh, no, you're flying it.

54:39.450 --> 54:41.315
Yeah!

54:52.596 --> 54:55.326
- Throttle back, throttle back!
- Throttle back!

54:56.199 --> 54:57.860
Throttle back. Throttle back.

55:00.470 --> 55:02.404
Oh, God!

55:02.539 --> 55:05.099
Well, so much for my aviation career.

55:05.242 --> 55:08.678
Oh, God. So much for my love life.

55:19.055 --> 55:20.044
Yo, Novak.

55:20.190 --> 55:23.956
- Oh, my God!
- Holy fuck!

55:24.094 --> 55:25.857
Oh, my God!

55:27.364 --> 55:30.424
- Are you all right?
- Oh, my God!

55:30.567 --> 55:33.900
Dude, you have no idea
how fucking perfect that was.

55:34.037 --> 55:36.028
Help me up. No, not that way.

55:38.742 --> 55:40.937
Dude, we gotta see that shit.

55:41.077 --> 55:43.773
Dude, it hit so fucking hard, my face...

55:46.983 --> 55:49.816
- That's the brake.
- Look at the weld.

55:49.953 --> 55:52.922
- I've had stronger silverware.
- How fast does it go?

55:53.056 --> 55:55.923
It's kind of fast
for being as cruddy as they are.

55:56.059 --> 55:59.460
- So you're saying he might make it.
- He'll definitely make it.

55:59.596 --> 56:01.791
- Dude, you got this.
- Nothing.

56:02.399 --> 56:03.661
Nothing.

56:05.602 --> 56:09.732
What's the furthest you've jumped
a motorcycle before?

56:09.873 --> 56:11.932
I haven't jumped a motorcycle.

56:14.711 --> 56:18.010
- So this will be your record.
- Yeah. I'm breaking records.

56:18.148 --> 56:21.584
I'm doing the Snake River
Redemption and, hopefully,

56:21.718 --> 56:24.209
if all goes as planned,
I will create a perfect rainbow,

56:24.354 --> 56:26.845
ending up in Wee Man's pot of gold.

56:27.490 --> 56:29.253
Or on Wee Man.

56:29.392 --> 56:30.984
- Either way.
- Either way works.

56:31.127 --> 56:34.688
The proud owner
of Wee Man's Chronic Tacos!

56:36.566 --> 56:40.093
At least your run-up ramp
looks like a piece of microwave bacon.

56:41.171 --> 56:43.105
Uphill!

56:43.239 --> 56:45.571
A very patriotic, microwave bacon.

56:45.709 --> 56:47.677
Just aim for the fucking leprechaun.

56:47.811 --> 56:50.075
I'm gonna try
and take out the leprechaun.

56:50.213 --> 56:52.943
- Land in the gold.
- Steal his gold.

56:53.083 --> 56:56.917
Whatever. Let's fucking get it over with
and go have some fucking tacos!

57:18.475 --> 57:19.703
Shit!

57:21.311 --> 57:23.074
- Fuck yeah!
- You all right?

57:28.952 --> 57:30.817
You OK?

57:30.954 --> 57:32.478
We got a Dunn down!

57:37.761 --> 57:39.661
You done good!

57:39.796 --> 57:41.263
That was fucking awesome.

57:41.398 --> 57:43.161
That was awesome, Dunn!

57:45.902 --> 57:49.030
Dude, that thing is squirrelly as shit!

57:49.172 --> 57:51.231
That was so amazing!

57:51.374 --> 57:54.969
I think it's time
for a Wee Man's Chronic Taco replay.

58:03.186 --> 58:05.051
Redemption is made!

58:09.726 --> 58:12.490
I'm Preston Lacy,
and this is the Apple of My Ass.

58:14.864 --> 58:16.798
- Want me to put it in, P?
- Put her in.

58:16.933 --> 58:17.922
Help me out, O.

58:18.068 --> 58:20.195
- What about the apple?
- I got it.

58:23.506 --> 58:26.100
- Is it in there pretty good?
- I think so. I think so.

58:26.242 --> 58:28.005
- A little deeper.
- I can make it fit way better.

58:28.144 --> 58:30.704
- A little deeper.
- What?

58:30.847 --> 58:33.839
- Hold it open, I'll put it in.
- There we go. That's in good.

58:33.983 --> 58:36.349
- Oh, Steve-O.
- My balls.

58:39.889 --> 58:42.084
Hold on.

58:42.225 --> 58:44.216
You don't like apple
and peanut butter?

58:47.330 --> 58:49.127
- Bring in Bob.
- Come on, Bob!

58:49.265 --> 58:51.699
Oh, don't bring in Bob.

58:51.835 --> 58:53.700
- Come on, Bob.
- Oh, my God.

58:53.837 --> 58:56.203
- Make him work for it.
- Come on, Bob.

58:56.339 --> 58:58.500
- Poor Bob.
- Come on, Bob.

58:58.641 --> 59:00.006
- Get it, Bob.
- He smells.

59:00.143 --> 59:02.703
Come on, Bobby. Bob-Bob. Bob-Bob.

59:02.846 --> 59:04.973
- The old forbidden fruit.
- Come on, Bob.

59:06.783 --> 59:08.978
- The Garden of Eatin'.
- Come on, Bob!

59:09.119 --> 59:10.711
Grip it, grip it.

59:14.257 --> 59:16.122
Bob.

59:18.528 --> 59:20.189
He really got in there.

59:20.330 --> 59:21.319
Oh, he's going back for more.

59:21.464 --> 59:23.625
Don't move.
He's going back for more.

59:23.766 --> 59:25.529
Good, baby.

59:25.668 --> 59:27.295
Put it back in there? OK.

59:28.104 --> 59:32.700
- Is that Bob?
- Oh, man.

59:32.842 --> 59:33.900
It's in there!

59:37.580 --> 59:39.639
It's still in there!
Get back down there!

59:39.782 --> 59:41.249
Get back down. It's still in.

59:41.384 --> 59:47.050
Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no!

59:51.161 --> 59:53.891
- Can I move this?
- Still have an apple in your ass?

59:54.030 --> 59:55.190
Got it out.

01:00:00.336 --> 01:00:02.133
Why did you do that, Jeff?

01:00:06.943 --> 01:00:10.344
See, Bob? I told you it's not
that hard to get into a movie.

01:00:43.245 --> 01:00:45.372
- You got it?
- Oh, no!

01:00:52.588 --> 01:00:55.421
I was checking out my new
haircut in the mirror.

01:00:55.558 --> 01:00:58.049
I was talking to Wee Man
over there, then I heard a...

01:00:58.194 --> 01:01:00.719
I'm like, "What was that?"
"I know what that was."

01:01:00.863 --> 01:01:02.490
Kinda hurt my nose.

01:01:05.868 --> 01:01:08.666
It's like way, way up in my brain.

01:01:10.606 --> 01:01:12.938
Me and the boys are about
to do a little Duck Hunting.

01:01:17.213 --> 01:01:19.613
- Pull!
- Oh, shit!

01:01:25.788 --> 01:01:27.983
You guys all right?

01:01:28.123 --> 01:01:32.219
- What did Andy do?
- He got fucked up.

01:01:32.361 --> 01:01:35.228
- Our timing was off.
- I don't know. When we jumped,

01:01:35.364 --> 01:01:38.959
somehow I got under him, he got
on top of me, and he landed on me.

01:01:39.101 --> 01:01:41.968
His head smashed me.

01:01:42.104 --> 01:01:43.571
- I'm shaking.
- It hurt so bad.

01:01:43.706 --> 01:01:46.197
- Got hit too.
- That looked hilarious.

01:01:46.342 --> 01:01:48.173
Now it's Parks's turn,

01:01:48.310 --> 01:01:51.575
and this duck's got
a little more meat on him.

01:01:53.482 --> 01:01:54.779
Pull!

01:02:01.123 --> 01:02:05.651
We lit him the fuck up.
Oh, my God!

01:02:10.899 --> 01:02:13.265
I got welted.

01:02:15.170 --> 01:02:17.502
It's like fuckin' falling
into a bees'nest.

01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:20.336
- Holy crap!
- We killed Quack Quack.

01:02:20.476 --> 01:02:22.603
- My whole back stings.
- Does it?

01:02:23.579 --> 01:02:25.638
Yeah, ten, 11 right there,
and that one.

01:02:25.981 --> 01:02:28.950
All right. So let's reload.
Get Dunn on there.

01:02:30.185 --> 01:02:34.554
Looks like Dunn's up next.
Ready, C-sucker?

01:02:36.425 --> 01:02:38.120
This one's a gobbler for sure.

01:02:41.196 --> 01:02:42.424
Pull!

01:02:57.746 --> 01:02:59.907
Good fucking God!

01:03:00.049 --> 01:03:04.042
I gotta give it to Paul Bunyan's
40-foot fucking cartwheel.

01:03:05.621 --> 01:03:09.717
You look like Buck Rogers
going through time, you know.

01:03:09.858 --> 01:03:13.419
Yeah, I felt like I was
in the air for a fortnight.

01:03:19.268 --> 01:03:20.667
Oh, my God.

01:03:22.938 --> 01:03:24.405
Jump out!

01:03:36.618 --> 01:03:38.518
I told you
I was gonna fucking clear it.

01:03:42.758 --> 01:03:45.158
That fucking just happened, didn't it?

01:03:47.629 --> 01:03:49.563
Hello. My name is Irving Zisman.

01:03:49.698 --> 01:03:51.757
This is my wife and granddaughter,

01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:55.199
and today I'm a Really Bad Grandpa.

01:03:55.337 --> 01:03:57.897
No, you're not, Grandpa.
You're the best.

01:03:58.040 --> 01:04:00.941
- Irving!
- Sorry, baby.

01:04:24.799 --> 01:04:25.993
Sorry.

01:04:26.134 --> 01:04:28.068
Sorry, man, sorry.

01:04:31.072 --> 01:04:33.973
Excuse me, homeboy,
can you take our picture?

01:04:34.109 --> 01:04:36.771
- I'm sorry to bother you.
- No problem.

01:04:36.911 --> 01:04:38.208
I'm so...

01:04:42.817 --> 01:04:47.277
Sorry. Thank you, buddy. OK?

01:04:47.422 --> 01:04:50.880
- You know what? I'm gonna pass.
- You just hit the button there.

01:04:51.025 --> 01:04:55.519
I'm going to pass on that.
Are you underage?

01:04:55.663 --> 01:04:58.996
No. This is my granddaughter.
She's of age. She's 19.

01:04:59.134 --> 01:05:01.125
Sir, you shouldn't be
kissing your granddaughter,

01:05:01.269 --> 01:05:03.066
slapping your granddaughter's
ass like that, sir.

01:05:03.204 --> 01:05:04.865
- She's of age.
- You can go to jail for that.

01:05:05.006 --> 01:05:07.566
I don't... I'm trying.
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

01:05:07.709 --> 01:05:09.700
You shouldn't be doing that
to your granddaughter.

01:05:09.844 --> 01:05:13.712
- What are you doing?
- Honey, I don't even know this man.

01:05:13.848 --> 01:05:17.215
I don't care. You're with your
granddaughter. That's terrible!

01:05:17.352 --> 01:05:20.116
- I've never seen anything like it...
- This is my wife.

01:05:20.255 --> 01:05:24.123
- This is your wife?
- Yes. Honey, I'm sorry.

01:05:24.259 --> 01:05:26.727
Don't bother coming home tonight!
OK? Don't bother.

01:05:26.861 --> 01:05:29.989
Honey! God. Jesus.

01:05:30.131 --> 01:05:32.656
- Why would you...?
- Go talk to her.

01:05:32.801 --> 01:05:34.860
Excuse me. I have my own problems.

01:05:35.970 --> 01:05:36.994
Honey!

01:06:07.802 --> 01:06:11.238
It's time to find out
if music calms the wild beast.

01:06:11.372 --> 01:06:13.499
I'm Ryan Dunn,
and this is the Ram Jam.

01:06:17.045 --> 01:06:18.137
Soothing?

01:06:19.614 --> 01:06:21.377
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

01:06:23.651 --> 01:06:25.243
He's already looking at me.

01:06:31.559 --> 01:06:35.393
Can you just go over there until
I get in here, buddy? Jesus.

01:06:43.271 --> 01:06:45.262
You better hurry up.
He's looking at me.

01:06:45.406 --> 01:06:49.809
- He looks beguiled.
- He's like, "Are these guys stupid?"

01:06:49.944 --> 01:06:52.845
- He doesn't like what he sees, though.
- Hey, little baby.

01:06:55.016 --> 01:06:56.916
That was good.

01:06:57.051 --> 01:06:59.815
- Play some music! Play some music!
- You're toast.

01:07:13.401 --> 01:07:15.096
- Steve-O, help him!
- Play some music!

01:07:16.437 --> 01:07:17.961
Steve-O, help him!

01:07:22.844 --> 01:07:24.436
Get it over here, Dunn!

01:07:24.579 --> 01:07:26.604
Go help him, Steve-O!

01:07:26.748 --> 01:07:28.909
- Save your bro!
- Help him, Steve-O!

01:07:32.587 --> 01:07:35.021
- Play!
- Steve-O!

01:07:35.156 --> 01:07:36.384
Play the trumpet!

01:07:41.729 --> 01:07:44.721
- Yeah, there you go.
- Just you, Steve-O.

01:07:54.342 --> 01:07:56.207
Maybe we used the wrong instruments.

01:07:56.344 --> 01:07:58.676
So you think music
calmed the wild beast?

01:07:58.813 --> 01:08:00.804
Not at all, man, not at all.

01:08:00.949 --> 01:08:02.109
I don't think so, either.

01:08:03.818 --> 01:08:05.649
Here we go.

01:08:08.089 --> 01:08:10.057
You guys look like idiots.

01:08:12.026 --> 01:08:13.152
Ready?

01:08:14.829 --> 01:08:15.955
Fore!

01:08:27.341 --> 01:08:29.572
- You all right?
- Yeah.

01:08:29.711 --> 01:08:31.975
- Did you take it in the neck?
- Yeah.

01:08:32.113 --> 01:08:34.581
Oh, my God, dude!

01:08:34.716 --> 01:08:36.979
You took it in the Adam's apple.

01:08:43.124 --> 01:08:48.118
- Hi, Spike.
- Ehren McGhehey. Travis Bickle.

01:08:48.261 --> 01:08:52.198
- He's got a tooth that we need out.
- I need it out.

01:08:52.332 --> 01:08:56.359
I need it because you need it.
Whatever you need, I need.

01:08:56.504 --> 01:08:58.368
- Let's get it out.
- We need it together.

01:09:01.042 --> 01:09:03.943
You wanna walk the walk,
you gotta talk the talk,

01:09:04.078 --> 01:09:06.205
or no one will take you seriously.

01:09:06.346 --> 01:09:08.109
Dr. Pontius? Dr. Dunn?

01:09:08.249 --> 01:09:10.774
- Can we do this?
- Finally!

01:09:10.917 --> 01:09:12.977
Tie him up and let's do it.

01:09:13.121 --> 01:09:14.587
Sit down.

01:09:15.723 --> 01:09:16.984
Relax.

01:09:19.727 --> 01:09:22.524
- Take it easy.
- Relax.

01:09:23.131 --> 01:09:25.861
You know why this happened.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:30.130
Flossing is just
as important as brushing.

01:09:30.270 --> 01:09:32.966
So what we're going to do is
extract Ehren's crooked tooth

01:09:33.107 --> 01:09:35.541
and then we're gonna replant it,
just like you would a tree.

01:09:35.676 --> 01:09:38.270
- But straight.
- But straight.

01:09:38.412 --> 01:09:41.348
I'm Danger Ehren, and this is
the Lamborghini Tooth Pull.

01:09:43.151 --> 01:09:46.917
Here's the good news:
What you're doing is stupid.

01:09:47.055 --> 01:09:48.386
So you got that going.

01:09:48.523 --> 01:09:50.218
Get in the Lambo, shitbird!

01:09:50.358 --> 01:09:53.225
This is gonna suck.

01:09:53.361 --> 01:09:57.092
Did your barber tell you to do this?
He seems like he's full of bad ideas.

01:09:59.434 --> 01:10:00.594
Are you stoked?

01:10:01.836 --> 01:10:03.827
It's a Lamborghini.

01:10:06.774 --> 01:10:08.708
Listen to that thing.

01:10:08.843 --> 01:10:12.904
- Open your eyes wide.
- Look at that bad-ass Lamborghini.

01:10:15.516 --> 01:10:16.744
Yeah!

01:10:21.322 --> 01:10:22.721
God!

01:10:26.661 --> 01:10:29.357
- Way to go!
- Fuckin' deuce!

01:10:29.497 --> 01:10:30.828
Victory.

01:10:33.768 --> 01:10:36.601
I wish I could say that didn't suck.

01:10:36.737 --> 01:10:39.262
- Oh, my God!
- You look terrible!

01:10:41.676 --> 01:10:43.940
Is it gone? Is it gone? It hurt!

01:10:44.879 --> 01:10:47.712
- Oh, my God!
- You did good.

01:10:47.849 --> 01:10:50.010
You did good. You did good.

01:10:50.151 --> 01:10:53.086
Man, that hurt me. Not really.

01:10:53.221 --> 01:10:54.552
Let me see, Ehren.

01:10:54.689 --> 01:10:58.648
- What'd it feel like?
- It hurt like a...

01:10:58.793 --> 01:11:01.091
- What was that?
- I don't know.

01:11:01.229 --> 01:11:04.164
- What... Are you crying?
- You're pulling my tooth.

01:11:04.765 --> 01:11:06.700
We already pulled your tooth.
We're not "pulling" your tooth.

01:11:06.700 --> 01:11:07.826
We already pulled your tooth.
We're not "pulling" your tooth.

01:11:08.802 --> 01:11:10.429
The tooth is officially pulled.

01:11:11.771 --> 01:11:13.966
Ehren, remember how I said
I could replant the tooth?

01:11:14.107 --> 01:11:16.905
- Yeah.
- That story wasn't true.

01:11:20.113 --> 01:11:22.104
I'm sorry.

01:11:22.249 --> 01:11:23.739
- Oh, my God.
- It was a story.

01:11:23.884 --> 01:11:25.351
We were trying to build up
your confidence.

01:11:25.485 --> 01:11:26.611
That hurts.

01:11:28.855 --> 01:11:30.618
A lot of doctors... dentists...

01:11:30.757 --> 01:11:32.315
I don't really consider them
real doctors.

01:11:32.459 --> 01:11:36.452
They think they're God,
you know? Not me.

01:11:38.064 --> 01:11:39.258
Satan.

01:12:23.643 --> 01:12:25.201
Yeah, he's soaked.

01:13:04.718 --> 01:13:06.151
You fucking...

01:13:22.569 --> 01:13:24.230
How much piss do you have?!

01:13:24.371 --> 01:13:27.238
Dudes, I'm telling you,
I drank a dozen of them things.

01:13:28.408 --> 01:13:31.400
All I got to say is,
Tremaine told me to do this.

01:13:53.767 --> 01:13:56.201
Ap and Phil just arrived
in Los Angeles.

01:13:56.336 --> 01:13:57.963
As soon as they check in
their hotel room,

01:13:58.104 --> 01:14:01.232
there's gonna be a gorilla
in there, aka Chris Pontius,

01:14:01.374 --> 01:14:04.707
and the trainer here, Will,
who's gonna try to tame him

01:14:04.844 --> 01:14:06.277
but it's gonna go horribly wrong.

01:14:06.413 --> 01:14:09.280
Basically, all hell's gonna break loose.

01:14:09.416 --> 01:14:11.407
It's gonna be a blood orgy.

01:14:33.873 --> 01:14:35.534
My goodness.

01:14:59.733 --> 01:15:01.394
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

01:15:01.534 --> 01:15:05.368
No, no, no, no!
It's OK! This is Samson.

01:15:05.505 --> 01:15:08.599
Just don't make eye contact.
Samson, down. Be quiet.

01:15:08.742 --> 01:15:11.074
He's a good boy. If he wants to
be a good boy, he's a good boy.

01:15:11.211 --> 01:15:12.644
Just don't make any
sudden movements.

01:15:12.779 --> 01:15:15.680
Don't make eye contact
with him. Samson...

01:15:21.054 --> 01:15:22.612
I'm getting my whip!

01:15:25.391 --> 01:15:26.289
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Get out of here!

01:15:26.325 --> 01:15:29.055
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Get out of here!

01:15:33.699 --> 01:15:35.792
Oh, God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

01:15:35.935 --> 01:15:40.838
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, Samson!
- Jesus Christ. What the hell was that?

01:15:40.973 --> 01:15:43.237
- There's a trainer...
- It's out! It's out!

01:15:43.376 --> 01:15:45.469
What happened to Phil?

01:15:45.611 --> 01:15:48.079
- The trainer will get him.
- He said be quiet.

01:15:48.214 --> 01:15:49.704
Sam, Sam...

01:15:49.849 --> 01:15:51.544
Oh, my God.
I never saw a gorilla before.

01:15:51.684 --> 01:15:53.675
- He's tame.
- He just wrecked the whole room.

01:15:53.819 --> 01:15:55.514
- There's a fucking trainer.
- Big deal!

01:15:55.655 --> 01:15:59.022
- Did this go wrong or something?
- Kind of.

01:15:59.158 --> 01:16:00.682
What was supposed to happen?

01:16:00.826 --> 01:16:03.556
- He's like the trainer...
- Oh, so what?

01:16:03.696 --> 01:16:05.061
He seems all right now.

01:16:05.197 --> 01:16:08.098
Was this supposed to be
just fun or something?

01:16:08.234 --> 01:16:11.328
He wants to go back in the room.
Do you have the key to that room?

01:16:11.470 --> 01:16:13.097
- Yeah.
- Give me the key.

01:16:13.239 --> 01:16:15.503
- Give me the key.
- My husband's in there somewhere.

01:16:15.641 --> 01:16:17.108
Is Phil OK? Is Phil out here?

01:16:17.243 --> 01:16:19.837
- I shit myself!
- What? Where is he?

01:16:19.979 --> 01:16:22.311
- I had to take a mean shit.
- There's a gorilla.

01:16:22.448 --> 01:16:25.042
I know. I had to take a mean shit.
It was coming out.

01:16:25.184 --> 01:16:28.119
Hear it? It's all juicy. I had to do it.

01:16:28.254 --> 01:16:32.987
- Phil, you are mingin'.
- I know. I had to.

01:16:33.125 --> 01:16:35.923
I need this thing off.
I can't breathe. I need this off.

01:16:36.062 --> 01:16:39.520
Is that a person?
That's a frickin' person.

01:16:39.665 --> 01:16:41.860
- It's Pontius, dipshit!
- Is that a person?

01:16:42.001 --> 01:16:43.730
Is that a...

01:16:43.869 --> 01:16:46.394
Oh, my God! I can't believe it!

01:16:47.673 --> 01:16:49.664
Did you almost have a heart attack?

01:16:49.809 --> 01:16:52.209
Oh, my God.

01:16:56.515 --> 01:16:59.541
- I'm so glad you're fake.
- Welcome to L.A.

01:16:59.685 --> 01:17:01.744
Phil's in there shittin'.

01:17:01.887 --> 01:17:04.287
- Get...
- It scared the shit out of Phil.

01:17:06.192 --> 01:17:07.386
All right.

01:17:09.028 --> 01:17:11.019
- That's a good one.
- Get it! Go! Go!

01:17:17.737 --> 01:17:19.068
Holy shit!

01:17:22.708 --> 01:17:24.801
Hello, my name is Johnny Knoxville,

01:17:24.944 --> 01:17:27.139
and today I'm an Invisible Man.

01:17:36.622 --> 01:17:38.249
You ready?

01:17:39.859 --> 01:17:41.053
OK.

01:17:51.971 --> 01:17:53.097
Take him around again.

01:17:56.008 --> 01:17:57.908
Am I still invisible?

01:18:01.414 --> 01:18:03.075
I hate when they do that.

01:18:05.251 --> 01:18:06.377
Fuck me.

01:18:12.892 --> 01:18:14.826
Where'd Knoxville go?

01:18:15.728 --> 01:18:17.059
He's up ahead.

01:18:18.164 --> 01:18:20.029
Is he close? Oh, fuck!

01:18:24.970 --> 01:18:26.232
Open the gate!

01:18:30.309 --> 01:18:32.777
That was fucking insane.

01:18:34.380 --> 01:18:36.940
- No, he landed bad.
- He really fell a little bit there.

01:18:37.083 --> 01:18:40.678
- Oh, Jesus.
- You OK, Johnny?

01:18:40.820 --> 01:18:44.881
Dude, that was a total neck-breaker.
I think it jarred his head.

01:18:45.024 --> 01:18:47.254
- Get the money shot?
- Oh, yeah, dude.

01:18:47.393 --> 01:18:49.452
Look at the feet mark
on top of the tree.

01:18:49.595 --> 01:18:50.789
Yeah, look it...

01:18:53.332 --> 01:18:56.233
- I got ups. Oh, yeah.
- Yeah, you did.

01:18:56.368 --> 01:19:00.236
- You were over the rainbow.
- I was over the rainbow.

01:19:02.274 --> 01:19:05.766
So, in this trailer,
we have a false floor

01:19:05.911 --> 01:19:08.971
with an 1 1-foot-deep pit we dug

01:19:09.115 --> 01:19:10.810
and filled with rubber snakes.

01:19:10.950 --> 01:19:14.044
And Bam thinks he's gonna
be doing a prank on Jeff,

01:19:14.186 --> 01:19:15.813
who's sitting in front of the trailer.

01:19:15.955 --> 01:19:19.447
But he's gonna be falling
into that pit, and when he does,

01:19:19.592 --> 01:19:20.718
Mr. David Weathers...

01:19:22.895 --> 01:19:27.093
...has a few hundred live snakes
we're gonna throw in there with him.

01:19:29.835 --> 01:19:31.860
Bam really hates snakes, too.

01:19:32.004 --> 01:19:35.838
This may be the first time
Bam cries in the film.

01:19:36.675 --> 01:19:38.165
- You ready?
- Yeah.

01:19:38.310 --> 01:19:40.835
- All right.
- You want to...?

01:19:40.980 --> 01:19:43.073
Tremaine's in a very vulnerable spot.

01:19:43.215 --> 01:19:45.240
I think it's time for Rocky.

01:19:45.384 --> 01:19:47.409
I think it's Rocky 4, I believe.

01:19:47.553 --> 01:19:50.386
Either way, he's getting
punched in the face.

01:19:50.523 --> 01:19:52.491
Be quiet.

01:20:05.137 --> 01:20:06.729
Oh, fuck!

01:20:06.872 --> 01:20:08.533
Fucking fuck.

01:20:12.077 --> 01:20:13.408
No!

01:20:13.546 --> 01:20:16.606
Are they real?
Get me the fuck out of here.

01:20:17.783 --> 01:20:21.082
You cocksuckers.
Dude, get me out, man.

01:20:21.220 --> 01:20:23.484
- They're not real, dude.
- What happened?

01:20:28.427 --> 01:20:31.157
- I want out, man.
- Bam. Bam.

01:20:31.297 --> 01:20:34.095
What, what?! Don't do this to me!

01:20:34.233 --> 01:20:38.499
Yo, seriously, get me out!
Get me the fuck out now!

01:20:38.637 --> 01:20:41.162
Now! Get me out now!

01:20:41.307 --> 01:20:44.299
Dude, stop, stop, stop!

01:20:44.443 --> 01:20:46.035
Oh, Jesus.
I'm stepping back for this one.

01:20:46.178 --> 01:20:47.907
Dude, stop fucking with me!

01:20:48.047 --> 01:20:52.609
- Hey, Bam.
- Dude, I fucking hate you guys.

01:20:52.751 --> 01:20:56.243
- Dimitry, please! Please!
- Is he crying?

01:20:56.388 --> 01:20:57.912
- Please! Please!
- He's really crying.

01:20:58.057 --> 01:21:01.584
Tremaine, you motherfucker!
Get me out now!

01:21:03.329 --> 01:21:06.321
It's not funny. It's not funny!

01:21:06.465 --> 01:21:09.866
It's not funny? I'm gonna argue
with you on that one, Bam.

01:21:10.002 --> 01:21:11.526
You fucking assholes!

01:21:11.670 --> 01:21:13.535
- Get him out.
- Get me out.

01:21:13.672 --> 01:21:15.139
Get me out.

01:21:19.945 --> 01:21:22.209
You can't do that to me, man.

01:21:24.216 --> 01:21:26.616
Sorry, bud.

01:21:26.752 --> 01:21:29.346
Dude, that is the worst fear
I could ever imagine.

01:21:29.488 --> 01:21:32.787
You fucking, dick-sucking,
fucking, asshole

01:21:32.925 --> 01:21:34.893
motherfuckers just did that to me.

01:21:37.129 --> 01:21:39.120
Look at the snake tracks on his back.

01:21:39.265 --> 01:21:41.495
You have snake marks on your back.

01:21:46.972 --> 01:21:49.167
- Oh, my God.
- That one is so big!

01:21:49.308 --> 01:21:52.471
That looks like hell in there.

01:21:52.611 --> 01:21:56.138
That was fucking terrifying. I can't
think of anything more terrifying

01:21:56.282 --> 01:21:59.251
than that, that just happened right now.

01:21:59.385 --> 01:22:01.546
Well, you're welcome, man.

01:22:04.123 --> 01:22:05.988
Fucking cocksucker.

01:22:07.626 --> 01:22:11.255
Your voice definitely did
have different nuances to it

01:22:11.397 --> 01:22:14.992
when you were hollering out
for... getting out of there.

01:22:15.134 --> 01:22:16.931
Stop it, man!

01:22:17.069 --> 01:22:20.061
Fuck, man! You're gonna make me
have heart... Seriously...

01:22:20.205 --> 01:22:24.869
Thank God I'm leaving at three today.
I am counting down the minutes.

01:22:25.010 --> 01:22:29.470
Seriously. With fucking
David Weathers around.

01:22:29.615 --> 01:22:32.209
I'm gonna see if there's
a one-hour-earlier flight.

01:23:20.966 --> 01:23:24.424
Most people don't like the idea
of being covered in dog shit,

01:23:24.570 --> 01:23:28.062
but that doesn't bother me
nearly as much as, like,

01:23:28.207 --> 01:23:31.176
rollercoasters and bungee jumping.

01:23:31.310 --> 01:23:33.403
I just can't do that shit, man.

01:23:33.545 --> 01:23:35.706
That's why this is gonna be fantastic.

01:23:36.815 --> 01:23:39.283
It's basically like a poo coaster.

01:23:39.418 --> 01:23:42.512
- You have really irrational fears.
- I know.

01:23:42.654 --> 01:23:45.179
"Cast me out to sea with sharks,
I don't care."

01:23:45.324 --> 01:23:48.350
"Put a hook through my cheek.
But I'm not bungee diving."

01:23:48.494 --> 01:23:49.791
What the fuck?

01:23:52.431 --> 01:23:54.296
Oh, my God.

01:23:55.634 --> 01:23:56.931
Come here, dude.

01:23:58.637 --> 01:24:00.298
I'm trying.

01:24:00.439 --> 01:24:03.374
- What's the problem?
- It fuckin' stinks like sh...

01:24:03.509 --> 01:24:04.942
...shit.

01:24:05.077 --> 01:24:08.535
I think it's about ten years ago today
that I was doing

01:24:08.680 --> 01:24:11.615
the first Poo Cocktail
and now you're taking the reins

01:24:11.750 --> 01:24:13.843
and taking it to a whole other level.

01:24:13.986 --> 01:24:16.546
- Yep.
- You look pretty happy about it.

01:24:16.688 --> 01:24:18.986
Hey, let's get me down
pretty fucking quick after this.

01:24:19.124 --> 01:24:22.719
I'm gonna be so claustrophobic,
it's gonna be ridiculous.

01:24:22.861 --> 01:24:24.795
- Do you have claustrophobia?
- Yeah.

01:24:24.930 --> 01:24:27.228
Just relax and enjoy your shit.

01:24:30.002 --> 01:24:32.994
I'm Steve-O, and this is
the Poo Cocktail Supreme.

01:24:37.042 --> 01:24:39.237
All right. Good luck.

01:24:43.449 --> 01:24:45.747
- You ready, Steve-O?
- No.

01:24:50.856 --> 01:24:53.723
Order up! Poo Cocktail Supreme!

01:24:58.931 --> 01:25:00.330
Oh, shit!

01:25:23.222 --> 01:25:24.746
Oh, shit!

01:25:39.838 --> 01:25:40.827
He's puking!

01:25:47.045 --> 01:25:48.171
Fucking gross.

01:25:49.781 --> 01:25:51.908
What's wrong with you, Bam?

01:25:54.586 --> 01:25:56.952
Oh, my God, dude.

01:25:57.089 --> 01:25:58.647
Are you OK, Steve-O?

01:25:58.790 --> 01:26:00.121
Oh, my God!

01:26:00.259 --> 01:26:03.285
It's gonna be ugly. I don't know
if you wanna see this.

01:26:06.265 --> 01:26:09.257
Oh, my God! Oh, Jesus.

01:26:10.669 --> 01:26:13.900
- Help him out of there!
- Let him out!

01:26:14.039 --> 01:26:15.631
I'm ready...

01:26:21.513 --> 01:26:22.707
Oh, my God.

01:26:22.848 --> 01:26:24.679
Jump in that lake right now.

01:26:24.816 --> 01:26:26.545
Oh, my God!

01:26:26.685 --> 01:26:28.448
Oh, my God.

01:26:39.698 --> 01:26:40.960
Jesus!

01:26:44.369 --> 01:26:46.360
Oh, God, it's so gross.

01:26:49.942 --> 01:26:53.969
This is the kind of extreme shit that
those extreme dudes don't even think of.

01:26:58.850 --> 01:27:01.944
That had it all.
That had danger. It had shit.

01:27:02.087 --> 01:27:06.456
It had puke. That's what
this show is all about.

01:27:07.726 --> 01:27:09.591
And sex appeal.

01:27:13.332 --> 01:27:15.698
All right, fellas,
we're gonna play a little game called

01:27:15.834 --> 01:27:17.825
Escaped Convict and Warden's Wife.

01:27:17.970 --> 01:27:22.430
And I'm pretty sure something sucky's
gonna happen when I push this.

01:27:22.574 --> 01:27:26.670
So would you guys rather
listen to Steve-O's rap album,

01:27:26.812 --> 01:27:29.872
- or have me push this plunger?
- Push the plunger!

01:27:31.483 --> 01:27:34.008
All right, let's end this turkey.

01:27:34.853 --> 01:27:37.253
Glasses on! Goggles on!

01:27:37.389 --> 01:27:41.553
Hello. My name's Johnny Knoxville
and I'm about to end this movie.

01:27:43.662 --> 01:27:44.890
What?

01:29:45.149 --> 01:29:47.913
Oh, my God! I don't believe...
Can you believe this?

01:29:48.052 --> 01:29:50.179
I don't understand
what the hell they're doing.

01:29:50.321 --> 01:29:53.620
I mean, it looks more like a riptide
to me. Don't you think so?

01:29:53.758 --> 01:29:56.556
This is ridiculous.
Now wait just a second.

01:29:56.694 --> 01:29:59.026
- How...? Is this the way you make...
- Rip Taylor!

01:29:59.163 --> 01:30:01.654
Shut up yourself! I'm just fed up.

01:30:01.799 --> 01:30:03.596
Who's the fat guy in the Speedo?

01:30:03.735 --> 01:30:05.999
Look in the mirr... Oh, my God.

01:30:06.137 --> 01:30:10.801
Look in the mirror. A grown man.
And they did it.

01:30:11.876 --> 01:30:13.935
And I can't believe all the confetti.

01:30:14.078 --> 01:30:17.639
And don't forget... Jackass 3D.

01:30:18.616 --> 01:30:20.516
- 3D!
- Thank you.

01:30:20.651 --> 01:30:22.642
No tongue! No tongue!

01:30:23.354 --> 01:30:24.685
No tongue!

01:30:25.490 --> 01:30:26.787
No tongue!

01:30:59.557 --> 01:31:03.550
I'm Danger Ehren, and that was
the Lamborghini Tooth Pull.

01:31:03.694 --> 01:31:05.753
- We're not using that.
- I don't care.

01:31:09.734 --> 01:31:11.827
Now we are using that.

01:31:30.455 --> 01:31:32.480
Dude!

01:31:32.623 --> 01:31:36.855
I was joking. You just broke Jeff's
cam... You broke your camera.

01:31:59.617 --> 01:32:01.016
Fucker!

01:32:03.287 --> 01:32:05.152
Fuck, OK, you got me, dude.

01:32:07.992 --> 01:32:11.325
Bro-zilian, take two, mark.

01:32:17.568 --> 01:32:19.399
Dude! Dude! Cut the...

01:32:19.537 --> 01:32:23.871
Dude, I will fucking punch you
in the face, dude! Stop it.

01:32:31.716 --> 01:32:33.946
Whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:32:38.656 --> 01:32:40.317
Oh, don't be a sissy.

01:32:41.726 --> 01:32:43.921
Three, two, one, go!

01:32:48.466 --> 01:32:51.264
Hi, I'm Johnny Knoxville.
Welcome to Jackass.

01:32:58.776 --> 01:32:59.936
Cut!

01:33:06.217 --> 01:33:07.684
My name is Eddie Barbanell,

01:33:07.818 --> 01:33:10.548
and this is some bullshit
with a plunger.

01:33:10.688 --> 01:33:12.087
Preston, move your ass.

01:33:24.569 --> 01:33:26.366
Come back here!

01:33:30.374 --> 01:33:31.773
This bruise looks old.

01:33:31.909 --> 01:33:35.208
Yeah, there's been a lot of
stuff going on back there.

01:33:35.980 --> 01:33:37.914
That's an official break.

01:33:38.049 --> 01:33:40.711
Jeez. That's so gnarly.

01:33:40.851 --> 01:33:42.785
That's some serious
bragging rights, right there.

01:33:43.988 --> 01:33:45.114
Happy birthday!

01:33:51.929 --> 01:33:53.123
Thanks.

01:34:00.137 --> 01:34:02.765
Oh, right there. That's the spot.

01:34:11.749 --> 01:34:15.583
Sorry. Had we known you didn't like red,
we wouldn't have wore this.

01:34:16.787 --> 01:34:17.776
Thanks, buddy.

01:34:19.824 --> 01:34:22.554
He's got it, he's got it! Oh, shit!

01:34:46.484 --> 01:34:47.746
Man, you jumped!

01:35:03.134 --> 01:35:05.500
Oh, you fucker. You fucker.

01:35:16.380 --> 01:35:19.474
I did it like you said.
I held the brake...

01:35:20.618 --> 01:35:22.882
Like this, while it's still...

01:35:29.727 --> 01:35:32.753
- Oh, my God!
- Yes!

01:35:32.897 --> 01:35:33.921
Yeah!

01:35:34.065 --> 01:35:35.828
That's my girl.

01:35:35.966 --> 01:35:39.163
- You're gonna roller-skate.
- Yeah, I'm an awesome roller skater.

01:35:39.303 --> 01:35:43.069
I know. I saw you a long time ago
at the L.A. River when you were...

01:35:43.207 --> 01:35:45.903
- Why you gotta bring that up?
- You were amazing!

01:35:46.644 --> 01:35:50.136
My name is Johnny Knoxville, and today,
I'm gonna jump the L.A. River.

01:35:55.419 --> 01:35:57.182
Help me! Help me!

01:36:04.628 --> 01:36:08.428
How's it going? I'm Steve-O, and I
collected nine days of elephant shit.

01:36:08.566 --> 01:36:10.659
No wait, that doesn't work.
What should I say?

01:36:10.801 --> 01:36:11.825
Say whatever you want.

01:36:30.321 --> 01:36:32.949
- Hi. I'm Jeff.
- Hi. I'm April.

01:36:33.090 --> 01:36:34.682
- It's nice to meet you.
- Hi, April. Nice meeting you.

01:36:38.662 --> 01:36:40.755
Look at these haggard tattoos he has!

01:36:40.898 --> 01:36:44.561
He's got a Chili Peppers sign.
And what's this? Blair Witch?

01:36:44.702 --> 01:36:47.102
- What's this one over here?
- That's a noose.

01:36:47.238 --> 01:36:49.172
- What does that mean?
- I don't know.

01:36:55.880 --> 01:36:57.507
That's Trip.

01:36:57.882 --> 01:37:01.477
- And action.
- Hi. Welcome to Jackass.

01:37:01.619 --> 01:37:05.316
I never wanted to be this.
I was hired to move the ramps,

01:37:05.456 --> 01:37:07.356
'cause I was the only one
with a pickup truck.

01:37:18.669 --> 01:37:20.227
Do it up and down.

01:37:45.396 --> 01:37:48.388
You! Pull that fucking
camera back, jackass.

01:37:49.400 --> 01:37:50.867
I know Johnny Knoxville,

01:37:51.001 --> 01:37:53.936
and he is not broadcasting
my crack to millions of people.

01:38:02.413 --> 01:38:03.710
Is this shoot over?

01:38:03.848 --> 01:38:07.682
Yeah. What did you want out of it?
You got whatever, you know?

01:38:43.310 --> 01:38:45.189
You did great today, Jeff.
