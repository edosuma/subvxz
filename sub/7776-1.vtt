00:17.350 --> 00:18.783
How about this one, Mom?

00:18.852 --> 00:21.650
It's nice, but we need to keep it under 9 feet.

00:21.721 --> 00:24.053
Twelve-footer, ma'am.
You won't find a prettier tree than that.

00:24.124 --> 00:26.456
Thanks, but our ceilings aren't that high.

00:26.526 --> 00:28.653
There's another one over here.

00:28.728 --> 00:30.787
How do we get the tree on top of the car?

00:30.864 --> 00:32.024
I don't know.

00:32.098 --> 00:34.225
Mom, I think we should call Dad.

00:34.300 --> 00:35.631
- Hi, Clare.
- Why?

00:35.702 --> 00:37.499
To come put the tree on top of the car.

00:37.570 --> 00:39.007
No, Jess,
we can do it.

00:39.072 --> 00:41.165
We can't reach. It's heavy, Mom.

00:41.241 --> 00:42.333
No, I'm listening.

00:42.409 --> 00:46.038
Stop talking about him.
It makes her feel bad.

00:46.112 --> 00:49.513
I know we decided on
a matte finish for the master bath.

00:49.582 --> 00:51.675
<i>I thought you were in Tahiti.</i>

00:51.751 --> 00:54.549
I didn't go. Henry had a meeting in China.

00:55.255 --> 00:56.620
How fast can you get here?

00:58.091 --> 01:00.116
You are so good to come, Jackie,

01:00.193 --> 01:01.820
but the painters took off.

01:01.895 --> 01:03.157
And I have this tasting...

01:03.229 --> 01:04.560
- Hi, kids.
- Hi.

01:04.631 --> 01:07.532
...with the caterer
for Henry's Christmas party.

01:07.634 --> 01:09.329
I'm so sorry.

01:09.636 --> 01:11.297
I'll call you tomorrow.

01:11.371 --> 01:12.633
Okay.

01:14.474 --> 01:17.204
We just drove a half an hour to get here.

01:17.911 --> 01:19.071
I know, sweetie.

01:19.145 --> 01:20.908
You should fire her.

01:21.448 --> 01:23.575
I can't fire her. She's my client.

01:23.650 --> 01:25.242
So, fire her anyway.

01:25.318 --> 01:26.979
No. She's my boss. It doesn't work that way.

01:27.053 --> 01:28.315
Come on, honey.

01:31.891 --> 01:33.552
Come on, Mom. Careful!

01:33.626 --> 01:35.890
- Mom...
- Yeah, I'm fine.

01:36.596 --> 01:37.688
Take this, Will.

01:37.764 --> 01:39.129
Okay.

01:39.399 --> 01:40.388
Okay.

01:40.467 --> 01:41.627
This way.

01:42.168 --> 01:44.261
Okay. So, I'm gonna put this together

01:44.337 --> 01:48.205
and then we'll put
the Christmas tree through here.

01:48.675 --> 01:50.040
You guys will lift it up and hold it

01:50.110 --> 01:52.476
and I will tighten the screws.

01:52.545 --> 01:55.571
Well, Daddy has a very smart one.

01:55.949 --> 01:59.510
Yeah, Dad has the new
no-tip, no-tilt, tap-a-toe stand.

02:00.987 --> 02:04.320
Well, we have this
perfectly lovely little Christmas tree stand

02:04.390 --> 02:06.255
that's been around
since before you were born.

02:06.326 --> 02:07.816
It's very old.

02:08.695 --> 02:10.925
Well, we don't trade it in

02:10.997 --> 02:12.897
just because there's
something new out there.

02:12.966 --> 02:15.799
So, we are gonna honor
this Christmas tree stand.

02:18.905 --> 02:20.600
Even if it is old.

02:25.712 --> 02:26.940
There.

02:31.317 --> 02:32.841
Can we put the lights on?

02:32.919 --> 02:33.908
Yeah.

02:33.987 --> 02:36.114
You know, let's take a break and eat.

02:36.189 --> 02:37.656
No, not yet.

02:37.724 --> 02:40.022
Melinda lets us eat when we want.

02:40.093 --> 02:42.926
Well, that's because Melinda
is Daddy's girlfriend and not your mother,

02:42.996 --> 02:45.191
and it's not her job to tell you when to eat.
It's mine.

02:45.265 --> 02:46.732
So let's eat.

02:48.301 --> 02:50.462
I just think that
when you're dealing with a print fabric,

02:50.537 --> 02:53.005
it's always best
to coordinate from the background color.

02:53.072 --> 02:56.906
And keep the accents the same throughout?
The magnolia white?

02:56.976 --> 02:59.137
Or Barcelona white, which is warmer.

03:01.848 --> 03:04.282
And one last thing I meant to ask you.

03:04.350 --> 03:07.945
This Christmas party, Jackie,
we'd love to have you.

03:08.021 --> 03:10.546
<i>I know it's your first Christmas</i>
<i>since the divorce.</i>

03:10.623 --> 03:12.853
Well, thank you. That's so sweet,

03:12.926 --> 03:15.292
but I'm spending Christmas Eve
with my kids.

03:15.361 --> 03:17.261
But thanks for thinking of me.

03:17.363 --> 03:19.160
I know how the holidays can be.

03:19.232 --> 03:21.223
Yeah. I appreciate it.

03:21.968 --> 03:23.560
<i>See you in the morning.</i>

03:23.636 --> 03:24.762
Okay.

03:40.119 --> 03:42.144
That looks so good.

03:42.222 --> 03:44.850
Okay, we've got 10 minutes.
Will, would you get the music?

03:44.924 --> 03:46.391
- Can I DJ?
- Yes, you can.

03:46.459 --> 03:48.791
- Yes.
- And Jess...

03:49.929 --> 03:51.590
- Okay, put these two in the dining room.
- Okay.

03:51.664 --> 03:53.894
- And that on the bar. That'd be great.
- Okay.

03:53.967 --> 03:55.867
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hey, Jess. Merry Christmas!

03:55.935 --> 03:56.993
Hi, Melinda.

03:57.070 --> 03:58.162
Merry Christmas.

03:58.238 --> 03:59.227
Hi.

03:59.305 --> 04:01.034
Thought we would
save some time in the morning

04:01.107 --> 04:02.699
by delivering the presents tonight.

04:02.775 --> 04:05.471
Dan, my Christmas party's about to start.

04:05.545 --> 04:06.569
It is?

04:06.646 --> 04:07.635
Hi, Melinda.

04:07.714 --> 04:08.703
Hi, Jackie.

04:08.781 --> 04:10.908
Could you just put
those presents under the Christmas tree?

04:10.984 --> 04:12.144
That'd be great.

04:12.218 --> 04:13.344
Okay.

04:13.419 --> 04:16.149
I see you got Will a snowboard.

04:16.522 --> 04:18.956
Yeah. I wanted him to have it for the trip.

04:19.024 --> 04:21.755
I thought we said no big gifts. We agreed.

04:21.995 --> 04:24.122
It's not a competition, Jackie.

04:24.197 --> 04:25.994
Can I turn this off?

04:26.599 --> 04:28.191
Yeah, you know what? I'm running late.

04:28.268 --> 04:29.997
Don't let the kids stay up too late tonight.

04:30.069 --> 04:32.765
I need them by 9:00. Flight's at noon.

04:33.406 --> 04:34.964
Jackie, this one's for you.

04:35.041 --> 04:36.531
Daniel said it's your birthday this week.

04:36.609 --> 04:38.577
It is. Thank you.

04:38.645 --> 04:41.808
Turning the big 4-0. Wow.

04:43.516 --> 04:46.451
It's designer sweats. Juicy Couture.

04:46.919 --> 04:48.682
I know how you totally
live in your sweatshirt.

04:48.755 --> 04:52.213
So I thought maybe you'd like a new one.
A fancier one?

04:53.393 --> 04:55.054
It's really comfy.

04:55.128 --> 04:57.722
Well, that's so thoughtful of you.

04:59.599 --> 05:01.032
Can I open this later?

05:01.100 --> 05:02.761
- Okay. Sure.
- Yeah, sure.

05:02.835 --> 05:05.429
Okay. Well, merry Christmas.

05:10.843 --> 05:12.902
- Hey!
- No, I'm listening.

05:12.979 --> 05:15.607
So, they're just standing there,
waiting for me to open this gift.

05:15.682 --> 05:16.706
What a jerk.

05:16.783 --> 05:18.614
Hey, Will, don't forget next week.
Your mom's birthday.

05:18.685 --> 05:19.743
I know.

05:19.819 --> 05:20.911
What a jerk.

05:20.987 --> 05:22.648
- You think it's jerky?
- Absolutely.

05:22.722 --> 05:26.681
To come here unannounced
with Melinda on Christmas Eve?

05:26.759 --> 05:27.987
Jackie, you're way too forgiving.

05:28.061 --> 05:29.494
I totally would've chewed his head off.

05:29.562 --> 05:32.622
Yeah, but do you think
I totally live in this sweatshirt?

05:32.699 --> 05:34.462
You have been in it a lot lately,

05:34.534 --> 05:36.627
and I think I was with you
when you bought it 20 years ago.

05:36.703 --> 05:39.729
Give me a break.
I didn't have time to change.

05:40.239 --> 05:42.366
But do you... Do you agree with Melinda?

05:42.442 --> 05:44.706
Well, who cares?

05:44.777 --> 05:47.439
Clearly, you're in that
"don't pay attention to me

05:47.513 --> 05:49.504
"'cause I'm broken and healing,

05:49.582 --> 05:52.551
"and I'm closed for shop
and mentally not interested in sex" phase.

05:52.618 --> 05:53.983
Trust me, you'll get over it.

05:54.053 --> 05:55.452
What are you talking about?

05:55.521 --> 05:56.647
Daniel's girlfriend.

05:56.723 --> 05:58.623
Oh, my God, I meant to tell you.

05:58.691 --> 06:01.819
I saw her at the supermarket last week.
She's, like, 16.

06:01.928 --> 06:03.418
Nice, Annie, not helpful.

06:03.496 --> 06:05.760
What? I'm sorry, but it's true.

06:05.832 --> 06:08.733
Jackie's prettier, of course, and smarter.

06:08.801 --> 06:10.098
What was Daniel thinking?

06:10.169 --> 06:12.865
He's thinking she looks like she's 16.

06:12.939 --> 06:14.998
Is Melinda the one-night stand
or the other one?

06:15.074 --> 06:16.735
Oh, no, no, no. She's the girlfriend.

06:16.809 --> 06:19.175
Six months, and she's not 16. She's 28.

06:19.245 --> 06:20.644
Does anybody want more champagne?

06:20.713 --> 06:22.476
No, thank you. I'm driving.

06:22.548 --> 06:23.913
No, we're having wine with dinner.

06:23.983 --> 06:25.917
Speaking of which, we gotta get going.

06:25.985 --> 06:27.179
You ready to roll?

06:27.253 --> 06:29.346
No, wait. Where are you going?

06:29.422 --> 06:31.390
Well, we have reservations at 8:00.

06:31.457 --> 06:33.755
Well, I made all of this food for...

06:33.826 --> 06:34.884
You're not leaving, right?

06:34.961 --> 06:37.259
Crap, I'm sorry, sweetie. Are you okay?

06:37.330 --> 06:39.389
You know what? Never mind.
Brian and I will stay.

06:39.465 --> 06:42.093
- We can stay, too.
- No, no, no, no, no. I'm sorry.

06:42.168 --> 06:43.760
You know what?
I just didn't want my party to end.

06:43.836 --> 06:45.701
- It's okay. You guys go.
- We understand.

06:45.772 --> 06:46.796
Just go. Have a good time.

06:46.873 --> 06:48.431
Sweetie, are you sure? You okay?

06:48.508 --> 06:49.532
You're doing great.

06:49.609 --> 06:50.974
- We'll make it up to you.
- Okay.

06:51.043 --> 06:52.408
- Mischa!
- Thank you.

06:52.478 --> 06:53.911
You know, we gotta get to the grandparents,

06:53.980 --> 06:55.379
but we'll be back for the leftovers.

06:55.448 --> 06:56.506
Hi, sweetie. Time to go.

06:56.582 --> 06:57.708
- Okay.
- Okay.

06:57.784 --> 06:59.445
Yay, yay.

07:28.314 --> 07:30.509
Mom, I'll help.

07:31.851 --> 07:34.411
Oh, no, no. You need your sleep.

07:34.487 --> 07:36.648
It's an early morning tomorrow.

07:36.722 --> 07:39.691
Your birthday's coming up. December 30th?

07:39.759 --> 07:41.590
Yeah. Yeah. Thirtieth.

07:42.094 --> 07:43.721
Maybe we shouldn't go skiing.

07:43.796 --> 07:45.127
Why not?

07:45.198 --> 07:47.098
Maybe we should be here.

07:47.800 --> 07:49.267
For my birthday?

07:49.335 --> 07:51.826
Yeah. I mean, you shouldn't be alone,

07:51.904 --> 07:54.668
like, all by yourself on your birthday.

07:54.740 --> 07:56.867
I'm not gonna be alone.
I'll be with my girlfriends.

07:56.943 --> 07:58.604
You don't have to worry about that.

07:58.678 --> 08:01.306
But shouldn't we have a party?

08:01.380 --> 08:04.008
You know what?
We'll have cake when you get back.

08:04.083 --> 08:07.280
But you're gonna
have some fun on the day, right?

08:09.622 --> 08:11.954
Yes. I am gonna have so much fun

08:12.024 --> 08:13.685
that I'm gonna track you down, call you,

08:13.759 --> 08:15.954
and make you sing <i>Happy Birthday</i> to me.

08:16.028 --> 08:19.225
- Promise?
- Promise. Go to bed.

08:19.565 --> 08:21.032
- Night, Mom.
- Good night.

08:21.100 --> 08:23.159
- Love you.
- Love you, too.

08:34.947 --> 08:37.073
This chocolate Santa was in your stocking.

08:37.149 --> 08:39.116
But you're not really eating sweets, right?

08:39.184 --> 08:41.210
No, you can have it.
Just don't eat it for breakfast.

08:41.287 --> 08:42.379
- Yeah. I love you.
- I love you.

08:42.455 --> 08:44.355
I love you. I love you.

08:44.757 --> 08:45.985
- Bye, Mom.
- I love you, Mom.

08:46.058 --> 08:48.185
I love you, too. Have fun.

08:51.531 --> 08:53.192
Merry Christmas!

08:53.266 --> 08:54.893
Merry Christmas!

09:05.745 --> 09:07.610
Hey, when are your kids back?

09:07.780 --> 09:09.839
The day before New Year's.

09:12.251 --> 09:14.481
I thought you guys
were two-weeks on, two-weeks off?

09:14.554 --> 09:18.081
Yeah, usually we are.
It's just, you know, the holidays.

09:19.258 --> 09:20.350
Why?

09:20.726 --> 09:22.318
Happy birthday.

09:22.461 --> 09:24.793
I'm taking you to Hawaii for your birthday.

09:24.864 --> 09:25.922
What?

09:25.998 --> 09:27.932
A quickie, three days, three nights,

09:28.000 --> 09:29.831
at the Royal Hawaiian Hotel.

09:29.902 --> 09:33.269
We'll get tans and massages
and drink pretty drinks poolside.

09:33.339 --> 09:36.274
- Kristine!
- What? You're my best friend.

09:36.342 --> 09:38.640
You're turning 40, and so am I soon,

09:38.711 --> 09:40.975
and we absolutely deserve this.

09:42.448 --> 09:44.313
Thank you.

09:44.383 --> 09:48.080
I don't know if it can work, Jackie.
We got a party that night.

09:48.154 --> 09:50.554
<i>Well, can you hire a sitter?</i>

09:50.623 --> 09:53.353
Think I'll find somebody on New Year's Eve?

09:53.426 --> 09:55.917
Dad totally sucks at board sports!

09:55.995 --> 09:57.019
<i>Well, thank you, Will.</i>

09:57.096 --> 09:59.257
Dad bailed seven times!

09:59.332 --> 10:01.698
Thank you.
May I have my phone back, please?

10:01.767 --> 10:03.826
<i>Listen, I'm gonna have to ask Melinda.</i>

10:03.903 --> 10:06.394
What, wait. My first vacation in three years

10:06.472 --> 10:09.134
is being held hostage by a 28-year-old?

10:09.709 --> 10:11.700
She's gonna be 29 in March.

10:11.777 --> 10:12.801
<i>She's that old?</i>

10:12.878 --> 10:15.142
All right, Jackie. I'll see what I can do.

10:15.214 --> 10:17.944
No, just let me know as soon as you can.

10:27.560 --> 10:29.892
- Jackie! Jackie.
- Hey.

10:29.962 --> 10:32.089
My grandmother fell and broke her hip.

10:32.164 --> 10:33.392
Oh, my... Is she gonna be okay?

10:33.466 --> 10:35.229
I hope so. I've gotta go to the hospital

10:35.301 --> 10:36.632
and speak with the doctors.

10:36.702 --> 10:38.397
There's no one else to do it.

10:38.471 --> 10:39.529
She sounds really scared.

10:39.605 --> 10:40.594
God. Okay, let's go.

10:40.673 --> 10:42.573
- Where are you going?
- I'm gonna drive you.

10:42.642 --> 10:44.200
No, you're not. You're getting on this flight.

10:44.276 --> 10:45.709
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

10:45.778 --> 10:46.802
No, I am not.

10:46.879 --> 10:48.744
- Jackie!
- Kristine, I am not.

10:48.814 --> 10:51.510
Jackie, stop acting like a five-year-old.

10:51.584 --> 10:52.846
- But...
- Everything is paid for.

10:52.918 --> 10:54.385
This is... This is your birthday present.

10:54.453 --> 10:55.784
What am I gonna do alone?

10:55.855 --> 10:57.152
Same thing we would do together.

10:57.223 --> 10:59.817
Get tanned, get massaged, sleep in.

10:59.892 --> 11:02.861
Besides, if you don't go,
I'll feel really horrible.

11:03.829 --> 11:05.126
I know.

11:06.699 --> 11:08.724
You know, you're right. I have to go.

11:08.801 --> 11:10.029
I promised Will.

11:10.102 --> 11:11.296
You promised Will what?

11:11.370 --> 11:13.895
I promised him that
I would do something fun on my birthday.

11:13.973 --> 11:16.601
So I told him I was going.
And he was very excited.

11:16.676 --> 11:19.201
Great. Wonderful. Go for Will, then.

11:19.278 --> 11:20.643
You martyr.

11:21.847 --> 11:22.905
Thank you so much.

11:22.982 --> 11:25.212
You're welcome. Have fun.

11:26.152 --> 11:27.210
Okay. I'm gonna have fun.

11:27.286 --> 11:29.345
- Okay. You have fun. Yes.
- Love to your grandma.

11:29.422 --> 11:30.684
Get on the plane.

11:30.756 --> 11:32.553
- Thank you!
- Of course.

11:32.625 --> 11:33.956
Call me when you settle in.

11:34.026 --> 11:37.052
Give me all the details, so I can be jealous.

11:39.265 --> 11:41.859
Our friends hate that we got divorced.

11:42.268 --> 11:45.829
You know. But, I mean, me and Daniel,
we had our differences.

11:45.905 --> 11:48.499
And not to mention that he was cheating.

11:48.574 --> 11:52.442
But my point is, is that I've never been
on vacation by myself.

11:52.511 --> 11:53.739
Ever.

11:58.017 --> 12:00.508
Thank you. You get what I'm saying?

12:01.087 --> 12:02.850
Yes. I think I get it.

12:03.656 --> 12:05.055
Is that it?

12:05.825 --> 12:06.951
Yeah.

12:10.896 --> 12:13.592
My only point was is that I'm almost 40,

12:13.666 --> 12:17.693
and I feel like I'm my daughter
starting school, you know?

12:18.604 --> 12:21.437
"Will it be fun? Will I make friends?"

12:23.709 --> 12:25.734
Have you ever felt that way?

12:25.811 --> 12:27.870
No. I like to travel alone.

12:30.015 --> 12:32.882
Right. You're working. I see that.

12:34.053 --> 12:37.045
I have a book. So I'll read my book.

12:37.923 --> 12:39.083
Quiet.

12:45.898 --> 12:47.866
<i>Aloha,</i> welcome to the Royal Hawaiian.

12:47.933 --> 12:49.298
Thank you.

12:52.438 --> 12:54.167
<i>Aloha,</i> Ms. Laurens.

14:00.272 --> 14:02.035
Ma'am, let me get you a lounge chair.

14:02.107 --> 14:03.438
Thank you.

14:11.951 --> 14:13.213
Ma'am.

14:13.285 --> 14:14.752
I didn't order a drink.

14:14.820 --> 14:17.812
This is from the gentleman across the pool.

14:17.890 --> 14:19.858
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

14:39.378 --> 14:41.573
Hi, I'm Michael.

14:43.282 --> 14:44.442
Hi, Michael.

14:44.516 --> 14:45.642
I sent the drink over.

14:45.718 --> 14:47.015
Yeah, thanks.

14:47.086 --> 14:48.576
So, you're on vacation?

14:48.654 --> 14:50.713
Yeah, yeah. Just got here.

14:50.789 --> 14:52.882
Yeah, we've...
We've been here since before Christmas.

14:52.958 --> 14:56.155
Kind of a work/play, sort of hybrid trip.

14:56.228 --> 14:58.287
Conventions and all that stuff.

14:58.364 --> 14:59.490
We're orthodontists.

14:59.565 --> 15:00.623
Okay.

15:00.699 --> 15:03.793
Did you have any work done on your teeth?
They're perfect.

15:03.869 --> 15:05.302
Not since I was 12.

15:05.371 --> 15:07.362
That was what, last year?

15:10.409 --> 15:12.934
So, I don't think I caught your name.

15:13.012 --> 15:15.003
I don't think I threw it.

15:15.414 --> 15:16.676
Great. You're not one of those ladies

15:16.749 --> 15:18.182
who's gonna go around
giving guys a hard time?

15:18.250 --> 15:20.275
'Cause I gotta tell you,
I'm not getting off this chair

15:20.352 --> 15:22.183
until you agree to have dinner with me.

15:22.254 --> 15:23.915
Excuse me, miss.

15:25.624 --> 15:27.421
I believe you signed up
for a surf lesson today,

15:27.493 --> 15:30.121
and it looks like you're running late.

15:33.232 --> 15:35.462
So, I'll grab your bag and towel, but...

15:35.534 --> 15:37.297
If you want
to come with me to the beach right now...

15:37.369 --> 15:39.200
Yeah. Surf lesson.

15:39.905 --> 15:42.430
That's why I came to Hawaii.
To learn how to surf.

15:42.508 --> 15:44.135
Yeah, and I'm sorry I kept you.

15:44.209 --> 15:46.507
- Yeah. No worries at all.
- Okay.

15:48.380 --> 15:50.712
Sorry, Michael. Nice to meet you.

15:55.454 --> 15:56.716
Thank you for saving me.

15:56.789 --> 15:59.849
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas to you, too.

16:02.594 --> 16:05.256
So, how about a lesson?

16:05.331 --> 16:07.697
- For real?
- Why not?

16:07.766 --> 16:10.963
Why? You can't teach an old dog new tricks.

16:11.036 --> 16:12.970
What dog? And who's old?

16:14.039 --> 16:16.098
Well, thanks, but I... No.

16:17.076 --> 16:20.341
Okay. Well, if you change your mind,
I'm around.

16:20.412 --> 16:22.107
By the way, the name's Kyle.

16:22.181 --> 16:25.878
Kyle. I'm Jackie.
Thanks again for rescuing me.

16:25.951 --> 16:27.714
It was my pleasure.

16:55.714 --> 16:58.046
Shoot! What's happening?

16:58.684 --> 17:01.778
- Hi. Are you here for a lesson?
- Yes.

17:02.454 --> 17:03.853
Let me take your name and room number.

17:03.922 --> 17:06.550
- Yeah, it's Jackie, Room 276.
- Jackie.

17:06.625 --> 17:10.220
Jackie, 276.
Do you have an instructor in mind?

17:11.163 --> 17:12.561
- No.
- No?

17:13.365 --> 17:15.833
Good, I'll sign you up with Karen.

17:16.201 --> 17:19.534
Wait. You know what?
There's someone I met. Kyle.

17:22.040 --> 17:23.303
Kyle's booked.

17:23.375 --> 17:25.741
Can I give you a call if someone cancels?

17:25.810 --> 17:27.608
No, no. Oh, no. That won't be necessary.

17:27.679 --> 17:30.079
- It's no bother. Really.
- No. No bother. I'm good.

17:31.116 --> 17:33.880
"Old dog"? You actually said that?

17:35.554 --> 17:37.545
Well, he made me so nervous.

17:37.623 --> 17:39.181
Yeah, but that was your excuse?

17:39.258 --> 17:41.954
That you're 40
and you can't try something new?

17:42.761 --> 17:44.752
Well, it does sound stupid hearing it back.

17:44.830 --> 17:46.195
<i>It is stupid.</i>

17:46.265 --> 17:48.358
Okay. Hey, how is your grandmother?

17:48.434 --> 17:52.234
Scared. And hates hospitals.
I'm really glad I stayed.

17:53.138 --> 17:54.571
I'm sorry.

17:54.640 --> 17:56.164
<i>How's the room?</i>

17:56.608 --> 18:00.044
The room is gorgeous, Kristine.
Thank you so much.

18:00.579 --> 18:01.773
Jackie?

18:02.881 --> 18:03.905
Kris, can I call you back?

18:05.317 --> 18:06.409
Sure.

18:08.187 --> 18:09.245
Hi.

18:09.321 --> 18:11.516
- You were looking for me?
- No.

18:12.057 --> 18:15.390
Really? 'Cause Tommy said
you came by for a lesson.

18:15.461 --> 18:18.396
Yeah, that. Well, you convinced me.

18:18.464 --> 18:20.227
And you know, you're all booked.

18:20.299 --> 18:21.823
Actually, I have
a cancellation tomorrow at 5:00.

18:21.900 --> 18:23.731
So, last session of the day?

18:23.802 --> 18:26.327
No, no. That's okay. I'm good.

18:26.405 --> 18:28.339
You know,
surf wisdom says that you've gotta swim out

18:28.407 --> 18:31.808
of your comfort zone to catch the wave
that's gonna change your life.

18:31.877 --> 18:34.277
Surfing's going to change my life?

18:37.015 --> 18:38.983
See you tomorrow at 5:00.

18:59.037 --> 19:00.527
Great. Now, just keep your knees bent

19:00.606 --> 19:01.937
and your head in the center of the board.

19:02.007 --> 19:03.736
Just like you're dancing.

19:04.743 --> 19:06.574
All right. It tips, remember?

19:07.513 --> 19:11.745
Yeah. You know,
can't we go out when it's a little less wavy?

19:11.817 --> 19:14.945
No, no. See, we actually want waves.
We're looking for that. Waves...

19:15.020 --> 19:16.612
Waves are good.

19:18.290 --> 19:19.621
That good?

19:19.691 --> 19:22.717
Remember to keep your head
in the center of the board, and relax.

19:22.794 --> 19:24.261
Here we go.

19:26.999 --> 19:28.523
Watch your step.

19:28.600 --> 19:30.864
Scootch down on your board.

19:30.936 --> 19:32.062
- Little more.
- More?

19:32.137 --> 19:33.126
- Little more.
- More?

19:33.205 --> 19:34.194
- A little more.
- More?

19:34.273 --> 19:35.706
You're good.

19:37.509 --> 19:38.976
Paddle.

19:39.711 --> 19:42.976
I want you to get to your knees,
relax and paddle.

19:49.555 --> 19:51.785
All right, let's find you a good wave.

19:51.857 --> 19:54.553
One, two, three, go!

19:54.626 --> 19:57.288
Paddle. There you go. Paddle! Good job!

19:57.663 --> 20:00.257
Up on your knees, Jackie. Your knees.

20:01.266 --> 20:02.858
Nice. Your feet.

20:11.276 --> 20:12.971
Almost. What happened?

20:14.680 --> 20:15.874
I lost my balance.

20:15.948 --> 20:20.783
Right. 'Cause you didn't keep your head
in the center of the board like I told you.

20:20.852 --> 20:23.412
Next time do as you're told. Come on.

20:25.958 --> 20:27.220
Paddle.

20:28.260 --> 20:30.421
Up on your feet, Jackie! Up!

20:32.197 --> 20:33.789
Yeah! Go! Go!

20:44.610 --> 20:47.238
All right, you're getting up next time.
I guarantee it.

20:47.312 --> 20:48.301
What makes you say that?

20:48.380 --> 20:50.314
'Cause there are guys
who are 78 years old out here,

20:50.382 --> 20:52.316
doing this every day. Plus, you're a natural.

20:52.384 --> 20:55.842
Now, stop stalling already
and get back on the board.

20:55.921 --> 20:57.616
Come on, up and at 'em. Let's go.

20:57.689 --> 20:58.781
How much have I taught you?

20:58.857 --> 21:00.791
What did we practice on the beach?
Get on here.

21:00.859 --> 21:02.486
Up and at 'em.

21:02.561 --> 21:03.653
And start paddling. Let's go.

21:03.729 --> 21:04.753
- Paddling?
- Paddling.

21:04.830 --> 21:06.263
- Me?
- Yes.

21:06.331 --> 21:07.958
That's what you're for.

21:13.972 --> 21:15.303
I'm doing it.

21:15.374 --> 21:16.864
Go, Jackie!

21:18.677 --> 21:20.304
Are you watching?

21:27.352 --> 21:28.410
That was great!

21:28.487 --> 21:29.715
Awesome!

21:34.860 --> 21:36.885
How about a drink? On me.

21:37.596 --> 21:39.029
Yeah. Cool.

21:40.232 --> 21:42.928
So, what brings you to Hawaii?
Vacation or work?

21:43.001 --> 21:44.468
Vacation.

21:44.536 --> 21:46.163
Actually, this was a gift
from a friend of mine,

21:46.238 --> 21:49.571
but she couldn't come
because her grandmother fell.

21:49.641 --> 21:51.905
It's for my birthday. My 40th.

21:52.644 --> 21:54.737
Nice. When's your birthday?

21:55.047 --> 21:57.743
Tomorrow. Or tonight in a few hours.

21:58.383 --> 21:59.975
Well, happy birthday.

22:00.052 --> 22:01.280
Thanks.

22:05.557 --> 22:08.355
- So, you're from Malibu?
- Yeah.

22:08.427 --> 22:10.657
Why did you move to Hawaii?

22:11.430 --> 22:14.024
- The long version or the short?
- I have time.

22:14.099 --> 22:15.566
Okay.

22:15.634 --> 22:18.398
Well, for starters,
my dad is an avid sailor, right?

22:18.470 --> 22:19.994
So, when I was 12 years old,

22:20.072 --> 22:22.131
he competed in this race
called the Transpacific.

22:22.207 --> 22:24.869
It goes from LA to Hawaii.
And they brought me along.

22:24.943 --> 22:28.106
So, after we...
Closer to the end of the race...

22:28.180 --> 22:29.238
- Hi, here you are.
- Thank you.

22:29.314 --> 22:31.214
- Thank you.
- Here you go.

22:31.283 --> 22:32.443
Yeah?

22:33.485 --> 22:35.680
It's 12 long days at sea.
We're at the end of this race here.

22:35.754 --> 22:37.654
And we're sailing through
the Molokai Channel,

22:37.723 --> 22:40.658
and there's just an incredible sunrise.

22:40.726 --> 22:45.163
And we go on, we see Diamond Head.
It's amazing.

22:45.230 --> 22:47.323
We keep going. We just come up,

22:47.399 --> 22:51.335
we see rows and rows of surfers
just hitting the curl at dawn.

22:52.037 --> 22:55.803
And as cheesy as this may sound,

22:56.708 --> 23:00.838
it was one of the most beautiful things
I've ever seen in my life.

23:01.913 --> 23:05.644
So I said to myself
that I had to live here someday.

23:07.219 --> 23:08.743
And now I do.

23:08.820 --> 23:12.722
Wow. It's a good story.
It's definitely beautiful here.

23:16.194 --> 23:19.129
- What?
- No. Nothing.

23:21.433 --> 23:22.695
No, what?

23:28.073 --> 23:30.098
You are really beautiful.

23:31.443 --> 23:32.842
Thank you.

23:33.278 --> 23:35.940
I remember that compliment long ago.

23:36.581 --> 23:38.378
You know, Kyle...

23:38.683 --> 23:42.278
When I asked you for a drink,
I wasn't hitting on you.

23:43.688 --> 23:49.558
I mean, I haven't been with anyone
but my husband since I was 26.

23:50.862 --> 23:54.821
You know, so this was a drink. That's it.

23:56.334 --> 23:57.460
Yeah.

24:09.481 --> 24:11.346
Get a room, will you?

24:11.850 --> 24:14.683
- Do you have a room?
- Well, actually, I do.

24:37.709 --> 24:39.199
What's wrong?

24:40.745 --> 24:42.838
It feels like it's the first time.

24:43.181 --> 24:44.739
Because it is.

24:45.083 --> 24:46.380
With me.

25:25.857 --> 25:27.381
Did you have fun?

25:27.459 --> 25:30.394
I did. Thank you.

25:32.931 --> 25:34.694
It was my pleasure.

25:39.137 --> 25:40.502
Thank you.

25:47.112 --> 25:48.511
I gotta run.

26:26.651 --> 26:28.915
<i>So, the door slams and he's gone</i>

26:28.987 --> 26:33.117
and I... I end up blubbering like a baby
till 3:00 in the morning.

26:34.192 --> 26:35.989
And that's how I rang in my 40th.

26:36.061 --> 26:37.494
<i>But, I mean, that's not the point.</i>

26:37.562 --> 26:39.086
<i>My point is, is that, as a grown-up,</i>

26:39.164 --> 26:40.722
aren't I supposed to be able to handle

26:40.799 --> 26:43.290
these ridiculously
stupid decisions that I make,

26:43.368 --> 26:47.099
and not end up in a ball
all wet and snotty all night?

26:47.839 --> 26:52.242
Okay. So, it's a sign of maturity
to have zero feelings?

26:52.310 --> 26:56.007
Well, thank God my coffee's here. Hang on.

26:59.684 --> 27:01.515
- Hi.
- Good morning.

27:03.855 --> 27:05.322
I'll call you back.

27:05.390 --> 27:06.857
Call me back.

27:08.193 --> 27:09.626
What are you doing here?

27:09.694 --> 27:13.562
I decided I would take the day off
to help you celebrate your birthday.

27:13.732 --> 27:16.360
Well, I... I already ordered breakfast.

27:16.735 --> 27:18.498
Great. I'm starving.

27:54.939 --> 27:57.464
I had no idea fish could be so beautiful.

27:57.542 --> 27:59.510
- Gorgeous, huh?
- Amazing.

28:08.420 --> 28:10.980
Buddy. He got stung by a jellyfish.

28:11.823 --> 28:13.848
I don't speak English very well.

28:15.960 --> 28:19.623
Hey, could you grab
the bottle of vinegar from my bag, please?

28:19.698 --> 28:21.563
You're gonna be okay.

28:27.572 --> 28:29.062
Thank you very much.

28:32.343 --> 28:34.743
I know it stings. You're okay.

28:34.813 --> 28:36.337
Here you go, buddy.

28:47.025 --> 28:48.993
<i>Will, that's so sweet of you to call.</i>

28:49.060 --> 28:50.152
Happy birthday, Mom.

28:50.228 --> 28:52.128
<i>Thanks, hun. Is Jessica there?</i>

28:52.197 --> 28:53.596
It's Mom.

28:54.899 --> 28:56.161
Happy birthday!

28:56.234 --> 28:57.258
Hey, Jess!

28:57.335 --> 28:59.394
<i>Are you having fun in Hawaii?</i>

28:59.471 --> 29:03.874
Yes. I saw the most beautiful fish.
And we saw a turtle, too.

29:03.942 --> 29:05.671
<i>No way! A big one?</i>

29:05.744 --> 29:07.211
You wouldn't believe how...

29:07.278 --> 29:09.906
Mom, I have to go
because we're having hot chocolate

29:09.981 --> 29:11.448
and Melinda's back.

29:12.183 --> 29:13.275
Okay.

29:13.351 --> 29:16.013
<i>I wish you were here,</i>
<i>but we got you a present.</i>

29:16.988 --> 29:19.081
Well, I can't wait. I love you, honey.

29:19.157 --> 29:21.216
Love you. Happy birthday.

29:21.292 --> 29:23.021
Thank you. Bye-bye.

29:24.429 --> 29:25.623
Lunch.

29:27.398 --> 29:29.798
You were really good with that boy today.

29:29.934 --> 29:32.869
Thanks. I've seen that injury a few times.

29:32.937 --> 29:34.962
All right, so, I got my three favorite things,

29:35.039 --> 29:38.702
Mahi tacos with pineapple relish,
Portuguese rolls with guava jelly.

29:38.777 --> 29:40.904
Amazing.
And Kona coffee to wash it all down.

29:40.979 --> 29:42.844
I'm sorry. But I'm not that hungry.

29:42.914 --> 29:46.247
That's funny how you keep saying that,
but I just don't believe it.

29:46.317 --> 29:47.409
Eat.

29:53.525 --> 29:54.719
There you go, see, got a mouthful.

29:54.793 --> 29:57.091
It's good. It's really good.

29:57.162 --> 29:58.151
- Really?
- Really good.

29:58.229 --> 30:01.687
Okay, now try a bite of this Portuguese roll.

30:02.167 --> 30:04.260
Who's a big girl? Come on.

30:07.438 --> 30:08.496
Wow!

30:10.909 --> 30:12.877
Why does everything taste better outdoors?

30:12.944 --> 30:14.502
It does, right?

30:14.779 --> 30:17.509
- I think I'll have another bite.
- Dig in.

30:19.117 --> 30:21.085
So, where'd you learn to speak French?

30:21.152 --> 30:24.280
I spent a year surfing in France. You?

30:24.355 --> 30:25.913
I took it in high school.

30:25.990 --> 30:30.051
Then, I went to the Sorbonne in Paris
for grad school in design.

30:30.461 --> 30:32.053
You're ringing.

30:34.032 --> 30:36.057
It's a client. I have to take this.

30:36.134 --> 30:38.102
What do you mean you have to take it?
It's your birthday.

30:38.169 --> 30:40.865
- Blow them off.
- Yeah, I wish I could, but I can't.

30:40.939 --> 30:43.032
Wait, what? Why can't you?

30:43.107 --> 30:44.870
She's one of my biggest clients.

30:44.943 --> 30:48.743
Okay, well, then tell her
you lost your phone in a waterfall.

30:49.080 --> 30:51.139
- What waterfall?
- Waihi.

30:51.216 --> 30:52.547
Waihi?

30:52.617 --> 30:55.313
It's absolutely beautiful.
I'm not gonna let you miss it.

30:55.386 --> 30:57.650
Unlike this call, which you just did.

31:00.525 --> 31:02.049
Come on, kook.

31:02.460 --> 31:04.257
Did you call me kook?

31:08.366 --> 31:09.993
Watch your step.

31:12.704 --> 31:14.865
Wow. It's beautiful.

31:14.939 --> 31:16.065
Check it out.

32:10.128 --> 32:11.254
This is it.

32:11.763 --> 32:14.391
Wow. It's really lovely.

32:14.465 --> 32:16.865
Yeah. All 800 square feet of it.

32:17.435 --> 32:20.700
No, it is. I mean, I like it.

32:21.506 --> 32:24.964
Takes a lot of thought
to make a home clean and simple.

32:25.243 --> 32:27.006
Yeah. It's a choice.

32:27.679 --> 32:30.546
It is. You know, with space and light.

32:31.215 --> 32:34.241
I'm always telling my clients
they need to get rid of the clutter.

32:34.319 --> 32:36.480
You know, let in the light.

32:38.256 --> 32:39.553
Exactly.

32:39.624 --> 32:41.819
You know, I think I'm gonna jump
in the shower real quick.

32:41.893 --> 32:43.451
Why don't you?

32:46.364 --> 32:50.425
Speaking of clutter, do you make drugs?

32:50.668 --> 32:51.760
No.

32:51.836 --> 32:53.531
What is all this?

32:53.604 --> 32:57.768
This is all-natural, non-petroleum,
non-toxic surf wax.

32:58.776 --> 33:01.677
- I make it from scratch.
- Surf wax.

33:02.280 --> 33:04.646
You ever heard
of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch?

33:04.716 --> 33:07.241
- No. What is it?
- It's between California and Hawaii.

33:07.318 --> 33:10.151
And it's just essentially
a gigantic heap of trash

33:10.221 --> 33:11.745
caught in the vortex
of all these currents, right?

33:11.823 --> 33:14.383
But the thing is massive.
It's like the size of Texas.

33:14.459 --> 33:15.721
Sounds horrible.

33:15.793 --> 33:18.626
So, my stuff is biodegradable.
That way it doesn't add to the mess.

33:18.696 --> 33:21.722
It's kind of like my way of,
you know, chipping in.

33:21.799 --> 33:23.289
Check this out.

33:23.368 --> 33:26.166
It's a guy from LA, Michael Larkin.
He wants to market it.

33:26.237 --> 33:27.329
He made me an offer up front.

33:27.405 --> 33:29.635
In fact, he still calls me
every other day about it.

33:29.707 --> 33:30.765
Well, have you called him back?

33:30.842 --> 33:32.366
- No.
- Why not?

33:32.443 --> 33:36.277
'Cause I'm an amateur in life
and I prefer to keep it that way.

33:36.347 --> 33:38.907
So, what are you saying?
You don't like professionals?

33:38.983 --> 33:42.578
No, I'm saying that
not everything needs to be exploited.

33:43.254 --> 33:45.245
I'm gonna take a shower.

33:46.858 --> 33:50.760
Yes, this is Kyle Hamilton's assistant,
calling for Mr. Larkin.

33:55.366 --> 33:58.028
Yeah, can you tell him

33:58.102 --> 34:00.434
that Mr. Hamilton would like to
schedule a meeting

34:00.505 --> 34:02.803
the next time he's in Hawaii?

34:03.975 --> 34:05.340
Thank you.

34:05.843 --> 34:07.640
What did you just do?

34:08.212 --> 34:10.442
Do you want me to do it for real?

34:10.514 --> 34:12.039
That was fake?

34:12.382 --> 34:14.078
It's 10:00 in LA.

34:14.152 --> 34:16.949
Because, you know,
you have to swim out of your comfort zone

34:17.021 --> 34:19.545
to catch the wave of your life.
Or something like that.

34:19.623 --> 34:22.217
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's... That's it.

34:22.693 --> 34:26.686
So, what you're saying is that
I should just get over it someday?

34:27.364 --> 34:28.592
Someday.

34:32.703 --> 34:36.002
So, nothing too dressy, right?

34:36.074 --> 34:38.371
Right. I don't get to watch you change?

34:38.443 --> 34:39.534
No.

34:40.078 --> 34:41.340
Why not?

34:44.047 --> 34:47.245
Because all of the lights are on,
and I've had two children.

34:47.318 --> 34:48.909
I mean, not that I'm complaining.

34:48.985 --> 34:51.580
As you shouldn't
because you happen to look beautiful.

34:51.656 --> 34:53.146
Thank you.

34:53.623 --> 34:55.956
Hey, how about this?

34:57.962 --> 34:59.589
That looks great.

35:01.032 --> 35:02.397
Thank you.

35:03.734 --> 35:05.326
How old are you?

35:05.837 --> 35:07.395
Does it matter?

35:08.139 --> 35:10.004
Am I breaking the law?

35:11.209 --> 35:12.733
Twenty-seven.

35:15.580 --> 35:18.481
I'm definitely not dressing in front of you.

35:19.217 --> 35:22.186
- Hey, you know what you need?
- What do I need?

35:22.253 --> 35:23.515
A bikini.

35:25.690 --> 35:28.022
That's exactly what I don't need.

35:32.864 --> 35:34.263
Get over it.

35:35.967 --> 35:38.026
Someday. Maybe.

35:39.837 --> 35:41.099
<i>Well, what went wrong?</i>

35:42.340 --> 35:43.807
I don't know.

35:43.875 --> 35:45.968
We both met when we were 24 in Paris.

35:46.043 --> 35:48.739
And two years later, he proposed.

35:49.514 --> 35:53.211
We got the first house, had the first child.
Then the second.

35:53.284 --> 35:56.447
And then I realized
I wasn't seeing him anymore.

35:57.255 --> 35:59.450
He was working. I was working.

36:00.091 --> 36:02.559
But when we would go home,

36:04.328 --> 36:07.195
we'd spend more time with the kids
than each other.

36:07.265 --> 36:08.596
And then?

36:08.666 --> 36:10.065
And then...

36:12.470 --> 36:13.960
My birthday cake came.

36:14.038 --> 36:18.372
Yeah, well, make a wish.

36:30.354 --> 36:33.755
Aloha, <i>welcome</i>
<i>to Honolulu International Airport.</i>

36:33.824 --> 36:37.487
<i>Passengers arriving for Flight 17,</i>
<i>due for Los Angeles,</i>

36:37.562 --> 36:38.893
<i>please proceed to baggage area...</i>

36:38.963 --> 36:40.362
Well, Kyle.

36:40.798 --> 36:42.288
Well, Jackie.

36:43.301 --> 36:45.428
It's really nice to meet you.

36:45.636 --> 36:46.967
Come here.

36:52.910 --> 36:55.606
I... I got you a little something.

36:55.680 --> 36:58.114
Just a token to remember your stay.

36:58.416 --> 37:01.180
Thank you. It's nice to meet you.

37:01.686 --> 37:04.951
- You already said that.
- Right. Take care.

37:06.123 --> 37:09.115
- Okay. Have a safe flight.
- Okay.

37:10.761 --> 37:12.319
Happy new year.

37:12.396 --> 37:13.920
Happy new year.

38:35.046 --> 38:38.573
- Nine, eight, seven, six...
- Nine, eight, seven, six...

38:38.649 --> 38:43.348
...five, four, three, two, one.
...five, four, three, two, one.

38:43.554 --> 38:45.715
Happy new year!

38:51.028 --> 38:53.292
Will, I so know
what you feel like on your board.

38:53.364 --> 38:55.264
I mean, I felt like a bird. Like I was flying.

38:55.333 --> 38:57.824
That's epic sick, Mom! You got up, brah?

38:57.902 --> 38:58.926
Yeah, brah.

38:59.003 --> 38:59.992
This is awesome.

39:00.071 --> 39:01.732
Look at me. I'm sick, too.

39:01.806 --> 39:02.830
You're so sick!

39:02.907 --> 39:04.238
Can I wear this to school?

39:04.308 --> 39:06.742
Yeah. With a long-sleeved shirt,
so you don't freeze to death.

39:06.811 --> 39:09.279
Mom, we got you stuff. It's your birthday.

39:10.414 --> 39:13.315
- It's from both of us.
- I drew the card.

39:13.384 --> 39:15.716
- Do I have to read it?
- Mommy!

39:16.320 --> 39:17.582
I'm sorry. Okay.

39:17.655 --> 39:19.520
"To Mom. Happy Birthday, Mom.

39:19.590 --> 39:22.252
"Love, Jessica and William."

39:22.326 --> 39:25.489
Beautiful. Thank you. So sweet. I love it.

39:32.870 --> 39:36.271
Wow! It's beautiful.

39:36.340 --> 39:37.898
That's an aspen leaf.

39:37.975 --> 39:39.738
It's for your keys.

39:40.077 --> 39:44.480
I love it. Thank you.
That's so sweet of you guys.

39:44.548 --> 39:46.311
You know what? I missed you so much.

39:46.384 --> 39:47.544
Give me hugs. Come here.

39:47.618 --> 39:49.210
- We missed you, too, Mom.
- We missed you, too, Mom.

39:49.286 --> 39:52.449
We're in the perfect position
for tickle torture!

39:59.530 --> 40:01.623
It was fun. What more do you want?

40:01.699 --> 40:04.497
Details. Look at her, she's beaming!

40:04.568 --> 40:06.763
Is this about the one-night stand?

40:06.837 --> 40:07.997
You had a one-night stand?

40:08.072 --> 40:10.131
Yes. And one night turned into two

40:10.207 --> 40:12.266
when he showed up
at her room the next morning.

40:12.343 --> 40:14.243
- No way.
- Start with his name.

40:14.311 --> 40:16.472
His name, Kyle Hamilton.

40:17.081 --> 40:19.379
- How old is he?
- Twenty-seven.

40:21.218 --> 40:22.879
Twenty-seven?

40:22.953 --> 40:25.387
Twenty-seven and a surf instructor.

40:25.456 --> 40:28.152
My goodness! And you had sex with him?

40:28.225 --> 40:30.090
Two days and two nights of just amazing...

40:30.161 --> 40:31.685
It was amazing?

40:32.296 --> 40:33.991
You know, and I owe it all to Kristine.

40:34.064 --> 40:35.622
How does one go about paying you back?

40:35.699 --> 40:38.793
Well, I'm just glad to see you happy.

40:38.869 --> 40:41.497
You know, like my grandmama always said,

40:41.572 --> 40:45.133
"The only way to get over a man
is to get under another."

40:45.576 --> 40:47.669
Your grandmother said that?

40:48.145 --> 40:49.442
Yes, she did.

40:49.513 --> 40:51.947
- Happy birthday, Jackie.
- Thank you.

40:52.016 --> 40:53.278
You're moving on.

40:53.350 --> 40:54.374
To moving on.

40:54.452 --> 40:56.283
- To moving on.
- To moving on.

40:57.521 --> 41:00.354
When I was rushing to pack,
I forgot my charger,

41:00.424 --> 41:03.257
and then I got there
and my phone was dead.

41:03.861 --> 41:06.261
Couldn't you use the hotel phone?

41:09.800 --> 41:12.200
Excuse me. It's Jessica's school.

41:15.906 --> 41:16.895
Hello?

41:16.974 --> 41:18.771
<i>What are you wearing?</i>

41:20.311 --> 41:22.836
Jeans and a shirt. How are you?

41:23.481 --> 41:24.539
I'm good. How are you?

41:25.649 --> 41:27.014
Very busy.

41:27.084 --> 41:28.142
<i>Sounds like you need a vacation.</i>

41:28.719 --> 41:30.914
I think you should come back to Hawaii.

41:30.988 --> 41:33.821
<i>I get vacations every five years.</i>

41:33.891 --> 41:35.916
Come on, Jackie. That's no way to live.

41:35.993 --> 41:39.429
Probably not. But I'm with a client.
Can I call you back?

41:39.497 --> 41:41.089
<i>Yeah. Hey, but think about it.</i>

41:41.632 --> 41:43.065
I'd really like to see you again.

41:43.234 --> 41:44.963
I'll call you back.

41:51.609 --> 41:53.076
It was a fling.

41:53.143 --> 41:55.509
Yeah. That's what I thought until he called.

41:55.579 --> 41:56.876
So, was it a fling?

41:56.947 --> 41:58.710
He's a kid, come on.

41:59.083 --> 42:02.678
He's young.
I mean, maybe if he weren't in his 20s.

42:02.753 --> 42:06.587
Excuse me? Have you not heard
of the Moore Phenomenon?

42:06.657 --> 42:08.284
Demi? Julianne Moore?

42:08.359 --> 42:11.089
They're both married to guys
that are 10 years younger than them.

42:11.161 --> 42:13.755
And Katie Couric? She's in her 50s
and her boyfriend's in his 30s.

42:13.831 --> 42:17.096
Katie Couric's boyfriend is a banker,
not a surfer.

42:17.401 --> 42:19.665
Yes. But Kyle is a surf instructor.

42:19.737 --> 42:23.229
A surf instructor who speaks French.

42:23.307 --> 42:25.002
- Did I tell you he speaks French?
- You mentioned it.

42:25.075 --> 42:26.838
What if he's a psycho?
What if he's stalking you?

42:26.911 --> 42:30.711
What if he's a psycho who stalks lonely,
more mature women?

42:31.949 --> 42:34.543
Come on, 40 is not that mature.

42:34.618 --> 42:36.415
And she's not lonely.

42:36.687 --> 42:37.813
Well, I'm a little lonely.

42:37.888 --> 42:40.482
No, but you're not,
you know, desperate, are you?

42:40.558 --> 42:42.025
No, maybe Nicole's right.

42:42.092 --> 42:44.788
I mean, maybe he just hits
on a different tourist every week.

42:44.862 --> 42:48.457
Yeah, and chops them up into little pieces
and puts them in his freezer.

42:48.532 --> 42:51.729
He was sweet.
And he was very tender in a way.

42:51.802 --> 42:54.362
Tender, as in the way he cooks you,
and then we never see you again.

42:54.438 --> 42:55.632
Yeah, exactly.

42:55.706 --> 42:56.968
Okay, you guys, give it up. Give it up.

42:57.041 --> 42:59.202
Maybe this guy is the love of Jackie's life.

42:59.276 --> 43:00.573
There's my baby!

43:00.644 --> 43:02.168
Hi, girls.

43:05.416 --> 43:07.316
So, you're taking the kids for break?

43:07.384 --> 43:09.375
Are you planning a trip?

43:10.287 --> 43:11.686
Not yet.

43:12.723 --> 43:15.157
Well, I am. So I thought I'd run this by you.

43:15.225 --> 43:17.955
You going to Hawaii to see your boy toy?

43:18.028 --> 43:21.020
Annie told Phil. Phil told me. God, Jackie.

43:22.099 --> 43:24.124
That's really beneath you.

43:24.668 --> 43:27.660
Actually, I was thinking of seeing my mom
in Connecticut.

43:27.738 --> 43:31.230
It's my two weeks, so it's really
none of your business where I go.

43:31.308 --> 43:33.401
Whatever, dude. Surf's up.

43:48.125 --> 43:50.093
Why do you even talk to him?

43:50.160 --> 43:51.923
- Who?
- Dad.

43:52.997 --> 43:56.933
- What do you mean?
- He always makes you upset. I saw you.

43:57.368 --> 43:58.562
Sweetheart, I'm sorry.

43:58.636 --> 44:00.866
You know, sometimes your dad
and I have disagreements,

44:00.938 --> 44:02.929
and we have to compromise.

44:03.007 --> 44:04.634
I'm sorry you saw me grumpy.

44:04.708 --> 44:07.404
You were happy
when you got back from your trip.

44:07.478 --> 44:09.309
Now you're sad again.

44:10.581 --> 44:12.776
I'm not sad. Really, I'm not.

44:13.384 --> 44:15.818
I like it better when you're happy.

44:19.390 --> 44:22.325
<i>Hey, you've reached Kyle Hamilton.</i>
<i>Leave it here.</i>

44:22.393 --> 44:25.624
Hi, Kyle. It's Jackie Laurens.

44:27.064 --> 44:29.624
I was just thinking about what you said

44:29.700 --> 44:36.003
and wondered if you were still interested in,
you know, getting together again.

44:38.676 --> 44:40.644
So, there. Okay.

44:41.779 --> 44:43.906
Call me if you want. Bye.

44:54.091 --> 44:56.184
<i>For your safety,</i>
<i>please do not leave baggage</i>

44:56.260 --> 44:58.694
<i>or personal belongings unattended.</i>

45:06.570 --> 45:08.800
<i>For your safety,</i>
<i>please do not leave baggage</i>

45:08.872 --> 45:11.272
<i>or personal belongings unattended.</i>

45:12.209 --> 45:13.972
He's not even here.

45:15.412 --> 45:17.039
What am I doing?

45:22.986 --> 45:24.851
That's what I'm doing.

45:54.651 --> 45:56.881
Not bad. You're looking great.

45:56.954 --> 45:58.148
Thanks.

45:59.389 --> 46:01.755
Did I tell you Will's into snowboarding?

46:02.359 --> 46:03.849
He's crazy about it.

46:03.927 --> 46:06.293
He's obsessed with
this Gretchen Bleiler girl.

46:06.363 --> 46:09.423
Yeah. She...
She won the gold at the X Games, right?

46:09.500 --> 46:14.597
I don't know about the X Games,
but blonde, cute, 17.

46:16.507 --> 46:19.101
So Will's into the older women, too?

46:19.743 --> 46:22.211
- Yeah. I guess so.
- Smart kid.

46:24.047 --> 46:25.571
How about Jess?

46:25.916 --> 46:27.747
Jessica's more of the brain.

46:27.818 --> 46:31.254
And she's really smart,
stubborn when she wants to be.

46:32.990 --> 46:34.787
I really miss them.

46:35.793 --> 46:37.260
I bet you do.

46:37.327 --> 46:41.593
No, but they would love it here.
Will would love to learn how to surf.

46:44.902 --> 46:47.530
Why don't you bring them out next time?

46:50.808 --> 46:53.333
<i>It's hot in downtown Denver</i>
<i>this Fourth of July weekend</i>

46:53.410 --> 46:55.310
<i>with temperatures reaching into the 90s.</i>

46:55.379 --> 46:57.813
Stay out of the sun, please, girls.

46:59.349 --> 47:02.409
I can't wait till summer's over,
and they're back in school.

47:02.486 --> 47:05.080
Nicole, you gotta see
these photos from Jackie.

47:05.155 --> 47:07.248
- Did she e-mail you?
- No.

47:07.324 --> 47:10.384
Well, apparently this guy's
some kind of amateur photographer...

47:10.460 --> 47:12.826
She's gone, like,
four times in the last six months.

47:12.896 --> 47:16.627
Wow. She's surfing.
She looks like she's good at it, too.

47:16.700 --> 47:19.066
It's a six-hour flight.
Half a day there, half a day back.

47:19.136 --> 47:21.627
This is a colossal waste of time,
don't you think?

47:21.705 --> 47:23.172
I don't know. I've never been.

47:23.240 --> 47:25.401
Nicole, she's having a midlife crisis.

47:25.475 --> 47:27.670
But instead of dyeing her hair
and taking yoga,

47:27.744 --> 47:29.678
she's flying halfway to Japan once a month.

47:29.746 --> 47:31.338
This is serious.

47:31.715 --> 47:34.411
Wow! Is that the guy? He's hot.

47:35.018 --> 47:36.076
I guess.

47:36.153 --> 47:37.916
No, he is. He's hot.

47:38.255 --> 47:41.383
My goodness. Look at those shoulders.
Look at his pecs.

47:41.458 --> 47:43.016
Okay, okay.

47:43.093 --> 47:45.186
We have to talk some sense into her.

47:45.262 --> 47:47.093
You're probably right.

47:47.164 --> 47:48.631
Go back one.

47:56.306 --> 47:58.433
Hey, I wanna ask you something.

47:58.508 --> 47:59.668
Shoot.

48:00.244 --> 48:03.042
Well, actually, I've been meaning
to ask you for a while, but...

48:03.113 --> 48:04.774
Back in Denver...

48:05.983 --> 48:08.349
You're not dating a bunch of mountain men,
are you?

48:08.418 --> 48:11.410
'Cause I just have this image
of these guys in flannel shirts

48:11.488 --> 48:13.615
with grizzly beards, and...

48:14.224 --> 48:15.316
No.

48:15.392 --> 48:19.089
Okay, good, 'cause I just...
I don't like the idea of that.

48:19.796 --> 48:21.627
What are you saying?

48:22.065 --> 48:25.296
What am I saying? I guess I'm saying that

48:26.403 --> 48:29.770
I really like you.
And I want you to be my girl.

48:31.975 --> 48:34.944
You like me,
and you want me to be your girl.

48:36.647 --> 48:37.807
Yeah.

48:37.881 --> 48:40.782
- And not date anyone else?
- No.

48:43.053 --> 48:44.611
What about you?

48:45.355 --> 48:47.619
I'm gonna date whoever I want.

48:51.094 --> 48:53.892
No, but seriously. How about it?

48:57.734 --> 48:59.759
I'd love to be your girl.

49:10.414 --> 49:12.348
Wow, you look amazing.

49:12.416 --> 49:13.849
Thank you. I feel good.

49:13.917 --> 49:15.009
The gang's all here.

49:15.085 --> 49:16.814
Hey, you guys.

49:16.887 --> 49:17.979
Hi.

49:20.223 --> 49:21.520
How was your trip?

49:21.591 --> 49:24.617
It was fine. What's going on?

49:27.164 --> 49:30.327
You've been to Hawaii
four times since Christmas.

49:30.634 --> 49:32.261
Do you know that?

49:33.503 --> 49:36.495
Yes, I do. What's the big deal?

49:37.140 --> 49:40.837
If it's not a big deal,
why are you keeping it such a secret?

49:40.911 --> 49:45.575
You know. I'm not. It's just that
I'm not kissing and telling all the time.

49:45.649 --> 49:47.412
How are you ever gonna
get used to being single

49:47.484 --> 49:49.577
if you keep running off to Hawaii?

49:49.653 --> 49:52.121
I'm not single. I have a boyfriend.

49:52.189 --> 49:53.747
He's your boyfriend now?

49:53.824 --> 49:56.759
Well, what about back here? There's lots
of guys we could set you up with.

49:56.827 --> 50:01.389
You guys have never set me up,
not once this whole year.

50:02.366 --> 50:03.594
We will now.

50:03.667 --> 50:05.999
Nicole's right. You belong here.

50:07.237 --> 50:10.229
Well, I like Hawaii and I like Kyle.

50:10.307 --> 50:12.400
So why don't I belong there?

50:12.476 --> 50:16.310
What you like is having sex in Hawaii.
That is what you like.

50:16.380 --> 50:18.940
You know, Annie,
you don't know the full story.

50:19.016 --> 50:20.643
He's 13 years younger than you.

50:20.717 --> 50:23.447
I mean,
how can this possibly be going anywhere?

50:23.520 --> 50:26.250
Well, I'm sorry
you can't wrap your head around it,

50:26.323 --> 50:29.417
but it's been going somewhere
for seven months.

50:29.493 --> 50:33.088
Okay, everybody. Maybe Jackie is right
and she knows what she's doing.

50:33.163 --> 50:35.427
Besides, we wouldn't even
be having this conversation

50:35.499 --> 50:38.559
if he were 40
and Jackie were the one that's 27.

50:38.635 --> 50:41.126
No, we shouldn't be
having this conversation anyway

50:41.204 --> 50:43.570
because it's really
no one's business but mine.

50:43.640 --> 50:46.473
We're your friends.
Your happiness is our business.

50:46.543 --> 50:49.842
And exactly what part of me
doesn't seem happy?

50:49.913 --> 50:51.505
Because I've never been happier.

50:51.581 --> 50:53.811
It just seems scary, that's all.

50:53.884 --> 50:55.784
We don't want you to get hurt.

50:55.852 --> 50:57.479
And you have to think about your kids.

50:57.554 --> 51:00.045
Okay, all right, hold it right there.

51:00.123 --> 51:03.217
I consider my children
in every decision I make.

51:04.728 --> 51:06.355
Jackie. Jackie, don't leave.

51:06.430 --> 51:10.491
No, you know what? I don't wanna
say anything that I might regret.

51:11.635 --> 51:13.398
My children are happy when I'm happy.

51:13.470 --> 51:14.835
We just think you deserve better.

51:14.905 --> 51:18.033
Based on what?
'Cause you haven't even met Kyle.

51:18.375 --> 51:20.570
Or maybe it's about something else.

51:20.644 --> 51:22.874
Like, gee,
suddenly my life as a single woman

51:22.946 --> 51:26.507
seems fun
instead of depressing or humiliating.

51:27.317 --> 51:29.251
And maybe my dangerous little vacations

51:29.319 --> 51:32.482
are better than being
in an office day and night.

51:35.258 --> 51:36.452
Jackie.

51:39.429 --> 51:40.953
That went well.

51:42.365 --> 51:43.855
Are you watching the sunset?

51:44.534 --> 51:46.126
It's about to dip under.

51:46.203 --> 51:47.830
<i>Describe it, please.</i>

51:47.904 --> 51:51.396
What are you looking at in the bathtub?
Describe that in full detail.

51:53.977 --> 51:55.205
Hold on.

51:59.049 --> 52:00.073
Hi, Clare.

52:00.150 --> 52:03.347
<i>I'm torn whether to go with Roman shades</i>
<i>or pleated in the den.</i>

52:03.420 --> 52:06.014
Roman shades in the den or pleated?

52:07.290 --> 52:09.349
Can... Can we go over this tomorrow?

52:09.426 --> 52:11.553
<i>Henry's leaving early. Can you come now?</i>

52:11.628 --> 52:13.357
Okay. I'll see you soon.

52:13.430 --> 52:14.761
<i>Thank you.</i>

52:17.501 --> 52:19.731
Sorry, Kyle. That was a client.
I have to go meet her.

52:20.504 --> 52:21.732
So late on a Sunday night?

52:21.805 --> 52:23.636
<i>Yeah. Her husband's leaving tomorrow.</i>

52:23.707 --> 52:26.301
So she wants me to meet him.

52:29.146 --> 52:31.637
Henry and I have decided
to build a second home in Jackson.

52:31.715 --> 52:32.875
- Hi, Jackie.
- Here are the plans.

52:32.949 --> 52:36.112
- Hi, Henry.
- 7,000-plus square feet.

52:36.186 --> 52:38.518
Three-car garage and spa.

52:38.588 --> 52:40.351
Excuse me, ladies.

52:40.423 --> 52:42.050
We would like you to get a head start

52:42.125 --> 52:43.217
and work with the architect.

52:44.227 --> 52:47.993
Oh, no. It's a dream job.
One that can land me in magazines.

52:48.398 --> 52:50.298
- Well, congratulations.
<i>- Thank you.</i>

52:50.967 --> 52:53.868
It's just the thought
of working for this woman another year...

52:54.671 --> 52:55.695
Do you have to?

52:55.772 --> 52:57.501
<i>Well, I mean, it's too amazing.</i>

52:57.574 --> 52:59.542
<i>But I have to figure out</i>
<i>what to do with the kids.</i>

52:59.609 --> 53:00.667
<i>You know, they're starting school.</i>

53:00.744 --> 53:03.269
All right, well, get a babysitter.

53:04.548 --> 53:07.449
Daniel won't let me.
He doesn't trust strangers.

53:08.118 --> 53:10.313
Daniel won't let you? Well...

53:10.954 --> 53:12.922
Babe, why do you
need Daniel's permission?

53:14.624 --> 53:16.854
You're right. I don't.

53:24.901 --> 53:27.199
Will, Jess, this is Lisa.

53:27.270 --> 53:28.328
- Hi.
- Hey.

53:28.405 --> 53:30.373
She's gonna be
helping us out for the rest of the summer.

53:30.440 --> 53:33.739
You know, driving carpool to camp,
stuff like that.

53:34.911 --> 53:36.378
Why don't you show her your room?

53:36.446 --> 53:37.970
- Sure.
- Sweet.

53:38.548 --> 53:39.776
Thanks.

53:40.750 --> 53:41.842
Mom?

53:44.154 --> 53:45.280
Yeah?

53:46.890 --> 53:51.259
- I have this girlfriend, Stephanie...
- I didn't know you had a girlfriend.

53:51.328 --> 53:53.922
I do. I met her at the Fourth of July.

53:54.731 --> 53:58.189
And yesterday,
when I came second in the swim meet,

53:59.336 --> 54:02.271
she said I didn't win 'cause I'm too small.

54:03.406 --> 54:06.807
She said I would swim faster
if I wasn't so little.

54:07.711 --> 54:11.340
First of all, Will, you're exactly the size
you're supposed to be.

54:11.414 --> 54:13.143
And everyone grows at different rates.

54:13.216 --> 54:16.879
You know, so no one can say who's too big
and who's too small.

54:16.953 --> 54:18.147
And judging by your father,

54:18.221 --> 54:21.418
you're gonna be towering
over all of us very soon.

54:22.192 --> 54:23.284
Yeah?

54:24.427 --> 54:28.591
And if Stephanie doesn't understand that,
and doesn't appreciate you for you,

54:28.665 --> 54:32.965
and exactly who you are,
then that's her loss.

54:36.606 --> 54:40.474
- Where'd you get this shirt?
- Melinda got it for me.

54:42.078 --> 54:43.807
- It's cool.
- Thanks.

54:45.949 --> 54:48.713
Hey, also, if Stephanie's your girlfriend,

54:48.785 --> 54:50.776
she shouldn't be saying mean things to you.

54:50.854 --> 54:54.187
She should be saying nice things.
Supportive things.

55:00.163 --> 55:02.188
- I love you, Will.
- I know.

55:05.201 --> 55:08.602
Come on, honey.
I'm only gonna be gone for five days.

55:08.672 --> 55:11.505
- Jessica, you are being very rude.
- No, I'm not.

55:11.574 --> 55:14.008
Yeah, you're acting like a three-year-old.

55:14.077 --> 55:16.238
Then go and leave me alone.

55:17.314 --> 55:20.442
I would like to say goodbye.
A proper goodbye.

55:21.051 --> 55:23.178
You know, I don't...
I don't know what you're so mad about.

55:23.253 --> 55:25.585
I thought you liked being here
with Daddy and Melinda.

55:25.655 --> 55:27.452
I told you I don't.

55:29.626 --> 55:31.992
Well, we have an agreement.

55:32.062 --> 55:33.359
Go then.

55:38.501 --> 55:40.128
This is because you're going to Hawaii.

55:40.203 --> 55:41.966
- Shut up, Dad!
- Will.

55:42.038 --> 55:44.905
She's our mom.
You're not supposed to be mean to her.

55:44.974 --> 55:47.306
You're supposed to be supportive.

55:48.545 --> 55:49.637
Will!

55:52.615 --> 55:54.344
He's right, Daniel.

56:04.461 --> 56:05.894
I have something for you.

56:05.962 --> 56:07.554
- Really?
- Yeah.

56:09.232 --> 56:11.166
For you. To inspire you.

56:11.935 --> 56:13.300
Thank you.

56:18.641 --> 56:21.132
<i>"Small Business for Dummies."</i>

56:22.011 --> 56:24.809
That's sweet of you, babe.

56:26.516 --> 56:28.643
Are you calling me a dummy?

56:28.718 --> 56:32.677
No, no.
I read that book before I went into business.

56:32.756 --> 56:34.018
Cover to cover.

56:36.226 --> 56:37.818
Let me ask you something.

56:37.894 --> 56:42.354
Would it be easier for you if I were a CEO
instead of a surf instructor?

56:46.503 --> 56:50.269
Kyle, I'm not trying to change you.

56:52.108 --> 56:54.269
I'm trying to inspire you.

56:54.344 --> 56:56.835
Yeah, but you already do inspire me.

56:57.547 --> 57:02.678
And I really like you.

57:04.788 --> 57:08.622
No. I love you, Jackie.

57:23.740 --> 57:25.503
Do you think it's weird
that neither one of us

57:25.575 --> 57:28.237
have met each other's friends yet?

57:28.311 --> 57:29.903
Maybe a little.

57:31.848 --> 57:34.408
What do you think we're waiting for?

57:34.984 --> 57:36.975
What are you waiting for?

57:37.987 --> 57:42.947
Honestly? A part of me, I think,
is waiting for you to turn 30.

57:46.029 --> 57:48.293
Are you embarrassed by my age?

57:48.898 --> 57:50.058
Are you?

57:50.133 --> 57:53.830
I mean, you could be
dating girls 20 years younger than me.

57:53.970 --> 57:56.165
We're different generations.

57:56.239 --> 57:58.070
Am I too old for you?

57:58.141 --> 58:01.133
No, sometimes
I actually think I'm too old for you.

58:01.211 --> 58:02.838
I'm happy to introduce you to my friends.

58:02.912 --> 58:05.881
I have no issue about it. Why would I?

58:05.949 --> 58:08.941
You're beautiful.
I'm proud to call you my girlfriend.

58:09.018 --> 58:11.043
Now, women in their 20s...

58:12.255 --> 58:13.483
Well...

58:14.624 --> 58:16.524
What about my friends?

58:18.294 --> 58:21.457
That's a bit of a bigger problem.

58:22.198 --> 58:25.429
I just... I don't make it
to the mainland that much.

58:25.502 --> 58:26.628
Ever?

58:28.705 --> 58:30.366
Once a year, tops.

58:31.140 --> 58:36.772
I mean, I don't know. Can I visit
the mainland? Can I live on the mainland?

58:36.846 --> 58:38.211
Honestly?

58:38.281 --> 58:39.839
Yeah, honestly.

58:41.651 --> 58:43.915
I don't like to leave the rock.

58:51.294 --> 58:53.762
You think it's selfish,
me not coming to see you in Denver?

58:53.830 --> 58:55.058
- Not yet.
- No?

58:55.131 --> 58:57.031
Ask me again in a few months.

58:57.100 --> 59:00.729
You know, I don't know. All the hustle
on the mainland just seems insane to me.

59:00.803 --> 59:03.294
I mean, you got this one life
and you're spending it sitting in rush hour

59:03.373 --> 59:05.170
or working under fluorescent lights

59:05.241 --> 59:07.505
in a climate-controlled room,
hunched over a computer,

59:07.577 --> 59:09.841
sucking back caffeine. And for what?

59:09.913 --> 59:11.710
You don't have to live like that.

59:11.781 --> 59:13.976
I know, but every time I go to the mainland,

59:14.050 --> 59:16.075
I'm afraid I'm gonna get sucked back into it.

59:16.152 --> 59:18.620
Well, you do live a more simple life
than most people.

59:18.688 --> 59:20.849
I think simple's underrated.

59:20.924 --> 59:24.018
I'm being an idiot, right?
Being a stubborn jerk?

59:24.093 --> 59:26.755
- Honestly?
- Yeah, honestly.

59:26.829 --> 59:29.093
I think you're acting your age.

59:38.041 --> 59:40.066
I'll get us another beer.

59:43.680 --> 59:46.205
- You hanging out with Kyle?
- Yeah.

59:46.282 --> 59:48.079
I'm Andrew Barry. Can I get you a drink?

59:48.151 --> 59:50.949
No, no, no. Kyle's... My son has that shirt.

59:51.020 --> 59:52.009
- This?
- Yeah.

59:52.088 --> 59:54.579
Yeah, this is me. I'm a pro surfer.

59:55.858 --> 59:57.450
How old is your son?

59:57.527 --> 59:59.324
- Eleven.
- Eleven.

01:00:00.129 --> 01:00:03.064
I've got some autographed T-shirts
in my bag.

01:00:06.469 --> 01:00:07.561
Wow.

01:00:07.637 --> 01:00:09.366
Here's a nice one.

01:00:11.908 --> 01:00:15.002
Shame on you, Drew.
You hitting on my girl?

01:00:15.078 --> 01:00:16.136
If that's okay?

01:00:16.212 --> 01:00:18.271
No, not unless you enjoy
eating through a straw.

01:00:18.348 --> 01:00:19.542
- Thank you.
- Take care.

01:00:19.616 --> 01:00:20.742
And if this doesn't work out...

01:00:20.817 --> 01:00:24.184
Yeah, yeah, beat it.
Go peddle your shirts elsewhere.

01:00:25.588 --> 01:00:27.180
How old is he?

01:00:27.657 --> 01:00:30.125
Twenty-one, and very much into you.

01:00:30.193 --> 01:00:32.024
I could be arrested.

01:00:32.095 --> 01:00:35.155
Hey, look, I got this for Will. It's signed.

01:00:36.165 --> 01:00:37.223
Wow.

01:00:44.741 --> 01:00:45.867
What?

01:00:47.710 --> 01:00:49.302
It's your phone.

01:00:57.487 --> 01:00:59.284
Seven messages. All from Daniel.

01:00:59.355 --> 01:01:01.482
- What?
- Something's happened.

01:01:07.897 --> 01:01:08.886
Hey, it's me.

01:01:09.032 --> 01:01:11.057
Where you been?
I've been calling you for hours.

01:01:11.134 --> 01:01:13.034
I didn't have my phone.

01:01:13.269 --> 01:01:14.634
What is the point of having a cell...

01:01:14.704 --> 01:01:16.638
<i>Daniel, what's going on?</i>

01:01:17.306 --> 01:01:18.330
There's been an accident.

01:01:18.775 --> 01:01:20.902
<i>Your babysitter was driving.</i>

01:01:21.377 --> 01:01:24.869
<i>- Will's fine. Jess is in surgery now.</i>
- Surgery?

01:01:25.682 --> 01:01:26.876
A broken arm.

01:01:26.949 --> 01:01:29.941
<i>- Is it really bad?</i>
- No, she's gonna be fine.

01:01:30.486 --> 01:01:34.547
<i>- What happened?</i>
- Some drunk ran a stop sign.

01:01:35.358 --> 01:01:38.225
Okay, you know what?
I'll... I'll be out on the first flight.

01:01:38.995 --> 01:01:40.360
Well, she has been asking for you.

01:01:41.998 --> 01:01:45.900
Well, just tell her I love her.
I'll be there as soon as I can. Okay?

01:01:46.669 --> 01:01:48.261
- Yeah.
<i>- Is Will there?</i>

01:01:48.337 --> 01:01:49.497
No, he went home with Melinda.

01:01:49.572 --> 01:01:52.336
Look, it's after midnight.
I wouldn't call now. He's probably sleeping.

01:01:53.443 --> 01:01:58.073
Okay. Okay. I'll call you back
when I know about my flight.

01:01:59.982 --> 01:02:02.075
I don't care how many times
I have to switch planes.

01:02:02.151 --> 01:02:05.643
Right now, I'm on a red-eye
from Honolulu to San Francisco.

01:02:05.722 --> 01:02:08.520
Now, I just need San Francisco to Denver.

01:02:09.525 --> 01:02:11.220
Okay. Bye.

01:02:12.095 --> 01:02:13.494
They've got me on hold.
They're working on it.

01:02:13.563 --> 01:02:15.463
Okay. I won't even call and bother you.

01:02:15.531 --> 01:02:17.396
Just let me know how she is
when you come up for air.

01:02:17.467 --> 01:02:19.799
Thank you. You know what?
I'll feel much better when I get home.

01:02:19.869 --> 01:02:21.769
Yeah. And I'll send you all your stuff.

01:02:21.838 --> 01:02:23.362
Take care, okay?

01:02:23.439 --> 01:02:25.873
<i>... is now scheduled to depart at 10:25.</i>

01:02:27.143 --> 01:02:30.601
<i>Dr. Ann Lynn, dial extension 2567.</i>

01:02:31.614 --> 01:02:34.048
<i>Extension 2567.</i>

01:02:37.019 --> 01:02:38.077
Hey.

01:02:38.154 --> 01:02:39.678
I thought you were
gonna catch the first flight out.

01:02:39.756 --> 01:02:40.814
I did.

01:02:40.890 --> 01:02:42.915
- It's almost noon.
- No kidding.

01:02:42.992 --> 01:02:46.359
- What are you wearing?
- It was the only top I had.

01:02:46.429 --> 01:02:48.795
Is that his? What is he, 12?

01:02:49.565 --> 01:02:50.793
I got this for Will.

01:02:50.867 --> 01:02:53.028
You know, feel free to leave.
I can sit with Jess.

01:02:53.102 --> 01:02:55.900
Will is on his way. Melinda is picking him up
from the swim meet.

01:02:55.972 --> 01:02:59.999
- No, I asked Lisa to pick him up.
- Well, she's not. I fired her.

01:03:00.076 --> 01:03:03.876
- Yeah, she told me, and I rehired her.
- I don't want her working for us.

01:03:03.946 --> 01:03:05.504
Daniel, it was an accident.

01:03:05.581 --> 01:03:08.141
And I have custody,
so I get to make the decisions, not you.

01:03:08.217 --> 01:03:10.481
- Maybe you shouldn't have custody.
- Be careful.

01:03:10.553 --> 01:03:12.987
You're an absent mother.
You're off in Hawaii.

01:03:13.055 --> 01:03:15.250
So you on the road
two weeks out of a month

01:03:15.324 --> 01:03:16.791
doesn't make you an absent father?

01:03:16.859 --> 01:03:20.022
- That's me making a living.
- That's you sleeping around in New York.

01:03:20.096 --> 01:03:21.825
Are we really gonna get into this here?

01:03:21.898 --> 01:03:24.264
Don't speak to my babysitter.
She's my babysitter!

01:03:24.333 --> 01:03:26.358
Mr. and Mrs. Laurens?

01:03:26.435 --> 01:03:28.164
I'm Dr. Sonnet, I'm Jessica's surgeon.

01:03:28.237 --> 01:03:31.229
- Do you and your wife have a moment?
- Ex-wife.

01:03:31.707 --> 01:03:33.698
Well, Jessica's doing great.
But we'd like to keep her

01:03:33.776 --> 01:03:36.643
for a couple of nights
just for observation if that's okay.

01:03:36.712 --> 01:03:39.146
Fine. As long as she's doing great.

01:03:42.251 --> 01:03:45.220
- He's not always that charming.
- Don't worry about it.

01:03:45.288 --> 01:03:47.415
- Thanks, Dr. Sonnet.
- Okay.

01:03:52.962 --> 01:03:54.224
- Jessica.
- Mommy!

01:03:54.297 --> 01:03:55.696
Oh, my God!

01:03:56.732 --> 01:03:59.200
Oh, my God! Are you okay?

01:03:59.268 --> 01:04:01.498
Yeah, stop, Mommy. I feel better.

01:04:01.571 --> 01:04:04.768
I'm so glad. I'm so sorry I wasn't here.

01:04:04.841 --> 01:04:06.468
I know. I know. It's okay.

01:04:06.542 --> 01:04:09.978
Yeah. Well, when Daddy called,
I went to the airport right away.

01:04:10.046 --> 01:04:13.675
Everyone sent me flowers. Everyone knows.

01:04:13.749 --> 01:04:17.185
Well, everyone was
very concerned about you, I'm sure.

01:04:18.354 --> 01:04:20.914
Yeah. Oh, my gosh, look at your cast.

01:04:20.990 --> 01:04:22.821
You know what?
We're going to have to get magic markers

01:04:22.892 --> 01:04:24.917
and have people sign it.

01:04:24.994 --> 01:04:29.124
- Yeah, it's still a little sore.
- Yeah. Well, when it feels better.

01:04:29.699 --> 01:04:31.758
Is there anything I can get you?

01:04:31.834 --> 01:04:34.166
- Can I please have my pillow from home?
- Yes.

01:04:34.237 --> 01:04:38.833
And the food's pretty weird.
There is a lot of JELL-O.

01:04:39.408 --> 01:04:42.206
Oh, my gosh, I'm so glad you're okay.

01:04:42.278 --> 01:04:43.870
It was scary.

01:04:44.647 --> 01:04:46.137
I bet it was.

01:04:47.116 --> 01:04:48.606
Look at all your balloons.

01:04:48.684 --> 01:04:51.118
Yeah, they're from Dad and Melinda.

01:05:10.339 --> 01:05:11.738
Jessica?

01:05:12.675 --> 01:05:17.078
Jessica, my friend in Hawaii sent you a gift.

01:05:18.180 --> 01:05:21.707
There. All the hula girls wear these.
They're orchids.

01:05:21.784 --> 01:05:23.376
- They are?
- Yeah.

01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:26.013
- You want me to read the card?
- Sure.

01:05:26.088 --> 01:05:27.988
"To Jess from Kyle."

01:05:33.696 --> 01:05:35.596
- "Dear Jessica..."
- Mom?

01:05:36.299 --> 01:05:38.824
I'm sort of worried you're settling.

01:05:40.403 --> 01:05:42.894
Settling? Where'd you hear that?

01:05:46.375 --> 01:05:49.811
Maybe your boyfriend's
not the best boyfriend for you.

01:05:49.879 --> 01:05:52.313
Maybe you're better than him.

01:05:52.381 --> 01:05:54.781
Oh, no, honey. That's not true.

01:05:54.850 --> 01:05:59.014
Kyle's a wonderful person,
which is why he got you this lovely gift.

01:06:00.089 --> 01:06:01.750
Are you sure?

01:06:01.824 --> 01:06:04.691
Yes, I'm sure. He was so worried about you.

01:06:05.294 --> 01:06:08.263
And he felt bad
that I was with him instead of here

01:06:08.331 --> 01:06:10.492
when your accident happened.

01:06:12.168 --> 01:06:14.728
Don't worry, I'm not going anywhere, okay?

01:06:14.804 --> 01:06:16.567
- You're not?
- I'm not.

01:06:16.639 --> 01:06:19.472
- Why?
- I want to be here.

01:06:20.476 --> 01:06:23.445
So, you're not going back
to Hawaii anymore?

01:06:25.514 --> 01:06:26.538
No.

01:06:27.350 --> 01:06:28.476
Good.

01:06:35.725 --> 01:06:39.217
<i>I can't keep leaving my real life</i>
<i>for a fantasy life.</i>

01:06:39.295 --> 01:06:40.284
Fantasy life?

01:06:40.796 --> 01:06:42.127
That's what it feels like.

01:06:45.368 --> 01:06:47.666
- See you tomorrow.
- Thanks, bud.

01:06:49.305 --> 01:06:52.172
Look, Jackie, you don't have to call it
a fantasy life to end things.

01:06:52.241 --> 01:06:53.868
But don't pretend like
what we had wasn't real.

01:06:53.943 --> 01:06:55.501
I'm not. I...

01:06:56.946 --> 01:06:58.277
<i>I'm saying it feels that way</i>

01:06:58.347 --> 01:07:02.750
<i>because you're</i>
<i>on the other side of the world.</i>

01:07:06.422 --> 01:07:07.719
You know what I think?

01:07:07.790 --> 01:07:10.156
I think your daughter got hurt
and it scared the hell out of you.

01:07:10.226 --> 01:07:11.557
As it should have.

01:07:11.627 --> 01:07:14.687
But now you're feeling guilty for it,
so you're crawling back into your hole.

01:07:14.764 --> 01:07:17.494
- You don't have children, Kyle.
<i>- So what?</i>

01:07:26.008 --> 01:07:29.239
I mean, all of this is
much more complicated for me.

01:07:29.311 --> 01:07:30.608
Life is simpler for you.

01:07:33.349 --> 01:07:34.816
That may be true.

01:07:35.317 --> 01:07:39.048
I don't know what to say.
I'm not good at goodbyes.

01:07:39.822 --> 01:07:43.314
Then don't say goodbye.
Say, "I'll see you later."

01:07:45.594 --> 01:07:48.062
I don't think I'll see you later, Kyle.

01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:51.960
Take care, Jackie.

01:07:54.737 --> 01:07:55.999
You, too.

01:08:19.261 --> 01:08:21.126
- Where are you?
- Sorry.

01:08:24.066 --> 01:08:26.761
When was the last time you spoke to him?

01:08:27.403 --> 01:08:29.962
Couple months ago. August.

01:08:31.774 --> 01:08:34.265
You know, all I want to say is that

01:08:35.243 --> 01:08:37.542
I'm sorry we ever said anything.

01:08:40.448 --> 01:08:45.216
You were happy with him, Jackie.
Jetlagged, but happy.

01:08:46.822 --> 01:08:48.153
Now lately you seem so...

01:08:48.224 --> 01:08:50.590
Kristine, I'm fine. Really.

01:08:50.658 --> 01:08:53.127
I mean, you know, just like Annie said,

01:08:53.194 --> 01:08:56.130
kids come first, and I need to be with them.

01:08:56.398 --> 01:08:58.194
You know that Will has a girlfriend?

01:08:58.267 --> 01:09:01.725
And not a two-week girlfriend.
A girlfriend since July.

01:09:02.104 --> 01:09:03.765
I know we're mothers.

01:09:03.839 --> 01:09:07.502
But that doesn't mean
that we should just lie down and die.

01:09:07.576 --> 01:09:12.309
Okay? I'm not gonna martyr myself
for my husband and my kids 24l7.

01:09:12.982 --> 01:09:14.540
Besides, you know what she told me?

01:09:14.617 --> 01:09:15.743
She and Phil haven't had...

01:09:16.652 --> 01:09:17.913
...in over a year.

01:09:17.987 --> 01:09:19.978
Yeah, well, we all make sacrifices.

01:09:20.055 --> 01:09:21.317
Come on.

01:09:22.191 --> 01:09:24.591
What about Kyle? Can't he come here?

01:09:24.660 --> 01:09:27.685
You know what? That's...
That was becoming an issue, too.

01:09:27.763 --> 01:09:31.028
All I'm saying is just give him a call.
Touch base.

01:09:31.300 --> 01:09:32.926
Happy Halloween.

01:09:33.769 --> 01:09:35.566
You know you want to.

01:10:11.507 --> 01:10:12.735
Hello?

01:10:13.876 --> 01:10:15.639
Hi, is Kyle there, please?

01:10:15.911 --> 01:10:19.108
He is, but he's in the shower right now.
Can I take a message?

01:10:20.216 --> 01:10:21.979
No, I'll call back.

01:10:27.990 --> 01:10:29.719
Hi, sorry I'm late.

01:10:29.792 --> 01:10:33.558
Is something wrong?
You seem preoccupied.

01:10:34.730 --> 01:10:38.666
Preoccupied? Clare, I see you every day.

01:10:38.734 --> 01:10:41.259
I see you more than
all of my other clients put together.

01:10:41.337 --> 01:10:43.202
Well, I asked you to be here at noon.

01:10:43.272 --> 01:10:48.209
Yeah, you called me at 10:00 last night
to change the 4:00 meeting to 12:00.

01:10:48.277 --> 01:10:50.905
- I got here as soon as I could.
- Fine.

01:10:50.980 --> 01:10:53.039
Actually, it's not fine.

01:10:53.115 --> 01:10:55.549
I don't think you realize
how much I bend over backwards

01:10:55.618 --> 01:10:57.245
to accommodate you.

01:10:57.319 --> 01:11:00.811
From now on you can
call me at home up until 6:00.

01:11:00.889 --> 01:11:04.052
But not after
and not before 8:00 in the morning.

01:11:04.526 --> 01:11:07.859
And if you want to pay me less,
then that's fine.

01:11:10.299 --> 01:11:12.290
- Done?
- Yes.

01:11:14.203 --> 01:11:15.636
Feel better?

01:11:16.972 --> 01:11:18.030
Yes.

01:11:24.546 --> 01:11:30.041
And then I found out they'd given partner
to that infuriating little creep.

01:11:30.119 --> 01:11:31.177
- No.
- What?

01:11:31.253 --> 01:11:32.618
And I yelled...

01:11:35.524 --> 01:11:36.923
At the top of my lungs, right?

01:11:36.992 --> 01:11:39.790
And everybody turned around
and looked at me like these people here,

01:11:39.862 --> 01:11:43.093
and I said, "Excuse me, gentlemen,

01:11:43.165 --> 01:11:46.760
"that was just the sound
of my head hitting the glass ceiling."

01:11:46.835 --> 01:11:52.239
So take that shattered glass
and add that to 300 times

01:11:52.308 --> 01:11:55.675
my annual salary,
and you'll get what it will cost

01:11:55.744 --> 01:11:58.440
to retrain and recruit my replacement.

01:11:58.514 --> 01:12:00.846
- Wow. Smarty.
- Yes!

01:12:00.916 --> 01:12:03.646
Gosh, you are so brave. You said that?

01:12:04.486 --> 01:12:05.646
No.

01:12:06.388 --> 01:12:08.447
But, well, you quit? Yeah?

01:12:09.858 --> 01:12:10.950
No.

01:12:12.428 --> 01:12:14.760
No, but that's what
I wanted to say to those bastards.

01:12:14.830 --> 01:12:17.060
They're jerks. They're jerks.

01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:19.062
I mean, seriously.

01:12:19.134 --> 01:12:20.692
It's okay, I'm fine. I'm over it.

01:12:20.769 --> 01:12:25.502
Let us drink and be merry. Okay?
Party like we agreed.

01:12:25.574 --> 01:12:26.768
Okay.

01:12:28.777 --> 01:12:32.042
Okay, okay, okay, Annie.
Annie, your quarter, your quarter.

01:12:32.648 --> 01:12:34.013
My quarter.

01:12:38.354 --> 01:12:40.015
Phil's leaving me.

01:12:45.094 --> 01:12:50.054
We haven't had sex in seven months,
one week and one day.

01:12:52.534 --> 01:12:55.230
He said that it's my weight.

01:12:56.572 --> 01:12:59.871
That it's irresponsible
to our marriage for me

01:12:59.942 --> 01:13:03.605
to have "let myself go" the way I have.

01:13:04.213 --> 01:13:06.408
What? That's bull.

01:13:08.984 --> 01:13:10.713
- Drink.
- Hell, yeah.

01:13:15.991 --> 01:13:17.185
Any other crappy news, anyone?

01:13:17.259 --> 01:13:20.228
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I called Kyle.

01:13:21.697 --> 01:13:23.324
A woman answered the phone.

01:13:23.399 --> 01:13:27.199
- Said he was in the shower. So, hang up.
- No.

01:13:28.404 --> 01:13:32.738
Jackie. I'm so sorry I was so hard on you.

01:13:32.808 --> 01:13:34.639
No, you were just jealous.

01:13:34.710 --> 01:13:37.474
I was. I was.

01:13:38.046 --> 01:13:42.574
That young hard body
jumping your puny little bones.

01:13:42.651 --> 01:13:46.712
All that sex. All that sex! Oh, my...

01:13:49.458 --> 01:13:51.517
Chad wants to set you up with someone
at Thanksgiving.

01:13:51.593 --> 01:13:53.390
- He's coming.
- Who?

01:13:53.829 --> 01:13:59.358
They play golf. And he's your age
with a six-figure salary. Maybe even seven.

01:13:59.435 --> 01:14:01.699
I met him once, and he's totally cute.

01:14:02.604 --> 01:14:03.696
Golf?

01:14:05.774 --> 01:14:08.902
- Here you go, Will. Silly girl.
- Thank you.

01:14:10.045 --> 01:14:11.239
Okay.

01:14:12.848 --> 01:14:16.284
Hey, Amelie, give the kids some pie
when they're done.

01:14:16.552 --> 01:14:18.452
And for the big table.

01:14:20.889 --> 01:14:24.017
- Are you sure we haven't met?
- Yeah. No, actually we have.

01:14:24.092 --> 01:14:25.116
Okay. Where?

01:14:25.194 --> 01:14:26.923
My daughter was in an accident
this summer.

01:14:26.995 --> 01:14:29.190
You were her surgeon. Jessica.

01:14:29.264 --> 01:14:34.167
- Jessica. It was a leg, right?
- No. The arm.

01:14:36.338 --> 01:14:37.396
I'm sorry.

01:14:37.473 --> 01:14:39.668
It's okay. You know,
I'm sure she'd be glad to see you.

01:14:39.741 --> 01:14:40.765
How is she doing?

01:14:40.843 --> 01:14:41.832
- Great.
- Yeah?

01:14:41.910 --> 01:14:43.844
You know, she missed tennis lessons
during the summer,

01:14:43.912 --> 01:14:46.437
but other than that, you did a great job.

01:14:46.515 --> 01:14:47.607
Phew.

01:14:47.983 --> 01:14:49.507
Phew is right.

01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:53.347
Well, you know what?
I'm gonna check on the kids.

01:14:53.422 --> 01:14:55.049
Okay. Sure.

01:14:58.827 --> 01:15:00.454
So, how's Suzie doing?

01:15:00.863 --> 01:15:01.989
Hey.

01:15:02.931 --> 01:15:06.526
Did you hear? Daniel and Melinda broke up.

01:15:07.402 --> 01:15:10.394
Really? No, he didn't mention it.

01:15:11.206 --> 01:15:13.800
Yeah. Phil told Annie, Annie told me.

01:15:15.677 --> 01:15:16.871
How's the doctor?

01:15:16.945 --> 01:15:19.914
You're not gonna believe this.
He was Jessica's surgeon this summer.

01:15:19.982 --> 01:15:21.449
You like him?

01:15:23.285 --> 01:15:24.479
Stop.

01:15:41.236 --> 01:15:42.897
For instance, if you take a procedure

01:15:42.971 --> 01:15:46.134
like a laparoscopic splenectomy,
for instance,

01:15:46.208 --> 01:15:48.836
which you would use
for certain immunological disorders

01:15:48.911 --> 01:15:52.642
like an idiopathic
thrombocytopenic purpura, for instance...

01:15:53.081 --> 01:15:54.241
I'm sorry. Am I boring you?

01:15:54.316 --> 01:15:55.681
- No.
- You sure?

01:15:55.751 --> 01:15:57.616
- No.
- Great.

01:15:57.686 --> 01:15:59.813
Well, it's something you can only do on...

01:15:59.888 --> 01:16:01.685
Could I interest you in a dessert menu?

01:16:01.757 --> 01:16:04.521
Oh, no, thank you very much.
I don't think we're gonna have any dessert.

01:16:04.593 --> 01:16:08.029
I really gotta watch my calories.
Check, please.

01:16:08.096 --> 01:16:10.189
- Very well, sir.
- Thank you.

01:16:11.366 --> 01:16:12.594
Where was I?

01:16:22.444 --> 01:16:23.570
Hey.

01:16:24.546 --> 01:16:26.070
I'm so glad you're here.

01:16:26.148 --> 01:16:28.343
I take it the date didn't go well.

01:16:28.417 --> 01:16:31.944
Oh, my gosh, he wouldn't
let me order dessert or coffee.

01:16:32.254 --> 01:16:35.348
- What's that? What are you doing?
- I'm making lists.

01:16:35.424 --> 01:16:36.914
Excuse me?

01:16:36.992 --> 01:16:41.224
Lists of possibilities.
Lists of things that I gave up on, like Kyle.

01:16:42.230 --> 01:16:44.255
You didn't give up on Kyle.

01:16:44.866 --> 01:16:46.959
Okay. Okay. You did.

01:16:47.035 --> 01:16:49.595
Did I ever tell you
I had this fantasy of going to Argentina

01:16:49.671 --> 01:16:52.105
to live there for a month and learn to tango?

01:16:52.174 --> 01:16:55.371
And one day,
I just thought it wasn't practical.

01:16:56.812 --> 01:17:00.908
But you know what? I'm doing it.
Summer vacation. Taking the kids.

01:17:01.783 --> 01:17:03.250
- Good.
- Yeah.

01:17:03.819 --> 01:17:06.982
- And may I?
- Yeah. I have 59 things.

01:17:07.656 --> 01:17:09.146
Learning to cook French.

01:17:09.224 --> 01:17:11.089
"Climb Mount Rainier."

01:17:11.994 --> 01:17:15.157
"Save the environment." That's a big one.

01:17:15.230 --> 01:17:18.529
Yeah. But you know what? We can
do something about it. We're only 40.

01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:21.467
I mean, we might have 60 more years of life.

01:17:21.536 --> 01:17:23.834
I'm not gonna spend the rest of it

01:17:23.905 --> 01:17:26.806
pretending that I care about something
when I don't,

01:17:26.875 --> 01:17:28.467
like skipping dessert.

01:17:29.444 --> 01:17:31.503
No. Not when I can be...

01:17:33.348 --> 01:17:35.282
When you could be what?

01:17:36.785 --> 01:17:38.082
Surfing.

01:17:57.906 --> 01:18:00.238
I'm open. I'm open. Over here!

01:18:01.109 --> 01:18:02.804
That's it. Attaboy!

01:18:04.813 --> 01:18:06.246
Yeah, good teamwork!

01:18:06.314 --> 01:18:07.338
I'm open.

01:18:07.416 --> 01:18:10.317
I heard you and Melinda broke up. I'm sorry.

01:18:11.486 --> 01:18:12.953
Sure you are.

01:18:13.355 --> 01:18:15.949
No, I am. I care about you.

01:18:16.024 --> 01:18:17.457
Let's not get into it.

01:18:17.526 --> 01:18:19.721
Get into what? Wait...

01:18:21.630 --> 01:18:25.726
I care about you. And you care about me.
You just talk to me with such...

01:18:25.801 --> 01:18:26.961
What?

01:18:27.936 --> 01:18:29.198
Contempt.

01:18:29.938 --> 01:18:32.463
You know, I hate what you're doing
to the memory of us.

01:18:32.541 --> 01:18:35.840
Acting like what we had
together wasn't real, and it was real.

01:18:35.911 --> 01:18:41.907
You know, maybe it didn't last,
but it was real at the time.

01:18:43.051 --> 01:18:45.281
Stick with 'em. Stick with 'em.

01:18:45.821 --> 01:18:48.813
I know it was real. You're right.

01:18:49.958 --> 01:18:51.755
When Melinda left me,
she said the same thing.

01:18:51.827 --> 01:18:55.627
She said that...
Said she didn't like the way I spoke to her.

01:19:01.036 --> 01:19:04.437
- She wants to have kids.
- Wow.

01:19:04.506 --> 01:19:07.441
Can I do that? I'm 42.
Can I be having babies now?

01:19:07.509 --> 01:19:10.774
Of course you can.
You're a great father, you know.

01:19:11.079 --> 01:19:12.706
Why wouldn't you?

01:19:13.014 --> 01:19:14.879
I thought you'd freak.

01:19:15.150 --> 01:19:20.383
If she makes you happy,
just try and work things out.

01:19:22.624 --> 01:19:24.387
Don't do what I did.

01:19:25.961 --> 01:19:28.395
You're not seeing your guy anymore?

01:19:29.464 --> 01:19:30.556
No.

01:19:31.967 --> 01:19:35.664
And one and two and three and four.

01:19:35.737 --> 01:19:39.229
And one and two and three and four.

01:19:39.307 --> 01:19:41.741
You know,
I'm going to Hawaii for Christmas.

01:19:41.810 --> 01:19:43.004
- You are?
- What?

01:19:43.078 --> 01:19:45.342
- You are?
- I'm taking the kids.

01:19:45.547 --> 01:19:47.845
- Are you going to Oahu?
- Yeah.

01:19:47.916 --> 01:19:49.110
Did you call Kyle?

01:19:49.184 --> 01:19:52.642
You know, I haven't yet.
Maybe I will when I get there.

01:19:53.321 --> 01:19:55.346
What if he's still with someone?

01:19:55.423 --> 01:19:58.551
You know, if he's moved on, then that's fine.

01:19:59.361 --> 01:20:01.693
We'll still have a wonderful week there.

01:20:01.763 --> 01:20:04.561
And Will will get to surf, and so will I.

01:20:08.904 --> 01:20:11.338
- So, how's packing going?
- Good.

01:20:11.406 --> 01:20:14.204
Jess wants to know
if Santa will be able to find us in Hawaii.

01:20:14.276 --> 01:20:16.244
- What did you tell her?
- I told her yes.

01:20:16.311 --> 01:20:18.643
Smart move. Here's sunblock.

01:20:19.247 --> 01:20:21.943
- Kyle called.
- Kyle called?

01:20:22.284 --> 01:20:23.945
About an hour ago.

01:20:24.519 --> 01:20:27.545
Kyle Hamilton? Did he leave a message?

01:20:27.622 --> 01:20:31.080
He said not to try him.
He said he'd call back.

01:20:31.159 --> 01:20:32.456
Thanks.

01:20:35.897 --> 01:20:38.422
So, the surfer closer to the break
gets the right of way.

01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:40.365
And the break is the white part of the wave.

01:20:40.435 --> 01:20:42.926
- I know what the break is, Mom.
- Do you, now?

01:20:43.004 --> 01:20:44.437
Merry Christmas!

01:20:44.506 --> 01:20:45.495
- Hey!
- Hi.

01:20:45.574 --> 01:20:47.542
Thank you for having us.

01:20:48.009 --> 01:20:50.307
I'm keeping it simple this year.
I ordered pizza.

01:20:50.378 --> 01:20:52.369
Pizza! That's perfect.

01:20:52.447 --> 01:20:54.005
It's freezing.

01:20:54.616 --> 01:20:55.605
There it is.

01:20:55.684 --> 01:20:57.914
Oh, no, no, no. No, no, no. I'm getting it.

01:20:57.986 --> 01:20:59.851
You guys are not gonna believe this.

01:20:59.921 --> 01:21:02.151
Jackie, you have guests.

01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:07.057
Hi.

01:21:13.802 --> 01:21:15.326
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:21:19.608 --> 01:21:20.802
Hi.

01:21:27.649 --> 01:21:32.382
I'm... I'm taking Will and Jess to Hawaii
tomorrow for Christmas.

01:21:33.455 --> 01:21:34.547
You're kidding me.

01:21:34.623 --> 01:21:36.989
No. The whole Christmas vacation.

01:21:37.058 --> 01:21:39.356
And my friends came over early
to celebrate Christmas.

01:21:39.427 --> 01:21:40.485
And this is Annie.

01:21:40.562 --> 01:21:43.429
- Hey. It's a pleasure to meet you, Annie.
- And you. Yeah.

01:21:43.498 --> 01:21:45.466
Jackie, this is Sabrina.

01:21:46.635 --> 01:21:48.159
I'm sorry. Hello.

01:21:48.236 --> 01:21:49.567
My sister.

01:21:52.073 --> 01:21:54.200
- Hi.
- So nice to meet you.

01:21:54.776 --> 01:21:57.438
You, too. I've heard so much about you.

01:21:58.647 --> 01:21:59.944
What are you doing here?

01:22:00.015 --> 01:22:03.951
Business. There was a surf and ski expo
at the Denver Center.

01:22:07.055 --> 01:22:08.454
I love this.

01:22:09.557 --> 01:22:13.721
Oh, my God, you are lit up.
I've never seen you look happier.

01:22:13.795 --> 01:22:16.457
- He does that to me.
- He is beautiful.

01:22:19.734 --> 01:22:21.725
<i>- What is today?</i>
<i>- Today?</i>

01:22:21.803 --> 01:22:24.328
<i>What is today, my fine fellow?</i>

01:22:24.439 --> 01:22:26.999
<i>Today? Why, it's Christmas Day.</i>

01:22:27.075 --> 01:22:29.475
<i>It's Christmas Day! Yes!</i>

01:22:33.615 --> 01:22:34.946
Excuse me.

01:22:44.592 --> 01:22:46.082
Take a look.

01:22:46.161 --> 01:22:48.186
- What is it?
- Open it.

01:22:54.269 --> 01:22:57.500
Wow! Is this yours? It's beautiful.

01:23:00.175 --> 01:23:02.837
I didn't think
you were ever going to leave the rock.

01:23:02.911 --> 01:23:06.779
Well, you weren't coming back,
so I had to figure something out.

01:23:06.848 --> 01:23:10.011
The surf expo was a good excuse
to come find you.

01:23:10.318 --> 01:23:12.616
Well, you look so professional.

01:23:13.154 --> 01:23:16.419
- What have you been doing?
- Acting my age, I guess.

01:23:17.859 --> 01:23:19.121
Me, too.

01:23:20.795 --> 01:23:22.353
You look great.

01:23:24.799 --> 01:23:29.293
I can't believe that we're going to Hawaii,
and you're not gonna be there.

01:23:29.771 --> 01:23:31.261
I'll be there.

01:24:41.476 --> 01:24:42.875
Good sticks.

01:24:46.414 --> 01:24:49.315
I learned it in high school.
Is that what I say?

01:24:49.517 --> 01:24:51.314
So, where did you...

01:24:51.386 --> 01:24:52.944
So, where did you...

01:24:53.588 --> 01:24:55.522
Where did you learn to take...

01:24:55.824 --> 01:24:57.052
I'm sorry.

01:24:57.125 --> 01:24:58.956
I can't do it that way.

01:25:02.564 --> 01:25:03.758
Marker.

01:25:10.872 --> 01:25:11.930
What?

01:25:12.006 --> 01:25:13.371
<i>Take the sunglasses off.</i>

01:25:13.441 --> 01:25:14.772
Thank you.

01:25:15.844 --> 01:25:18.142
- I said... Yeah.
- What do I say?

01:25:19.681 --> 01:25:21.171
Does that hurt?

01:25:21.249 --> 01:25:23.945
- No, it doesn't hurt.
- Does that? Or does that?

01:25:25.420 --> 01:25:27.388
That's sweet. That's cool.

01:25:33.495 --> 01:25:34.587
Sorry.

01:25:34.696 --> 01:25:36.459
And look like this?

01:25:39.267 --> 01:25:40.495
Hi, hi.

01:25:42.070 --> 01:25:44.732
Is it great? Does it look great?

01:25:46.407 --> 01:25:49.103
I forgot I was working with him. Sorry.

01:25:57.852 --> 01:25:59.046
Sorry.

01:26:02.657 --> 01:26:03.681
Not home.

01:26:03.758 --> 01:26:04.884
So good.

01:26:04.959 --> 01:26:07.951
Look who has their commercial
on Logo Channel.

01:26:10.298 --> 01:26:11.925
- Scene.
- And cut!

01:27:11.926 --> 01:27:12.926
