some scandalous pictures.

me some pictures of you

00:23.657 --> 00:24.525

up going to the bathroom.

09:48.221 --> 09:50.423
And all of a sudden,
it's-- like-- burning.

09:50.423 --> 09:54.260
Nattie, got ICY HOT in
the middle of her legs

butt a little bit.

BRYAN: Is she OK?

10:01.201 --> 10:03.536
Yeah, she was
putting ICY HOT on.

10:03.536 --> 10:05.071
JON: On what?

10:05.071 --> 10:06.673
On her back, because
it was hurting.

10:06.673 --> 10:08.308
And then, when she
used the restroom

10:08.308 --> 10:10.410
and she was wiping and
pulling up her pants,

10:10.410 --> 10:11.444
it's just burning.

Oh!

10:12.245 --> 10:13.713
What?

10:13.713 --> 10:15.215
Poor Nattie.

10:15.215 --> 10:21.588
How the hell do you get ICY
HOT down in this region?

10:21.588 --> 10:22.789
TJ: How the hell
did that happen?

10:22.789 --> 10:24.224
I had it on my hands.

10:24.224 --> 10:25.425
I rubbed it on my back.

10:25.425 --> 10:26.292
I went to the bathroom.

10:26.292 --> 10:28.428
And yeah, I accidentally
used toilet paper.

10:28.428 --> 10:29.262
So--

10:29.262 --> 10:30.396
BRYAN: Wait a second?

10:30.396 --> 10:31.631
Did you poop on the bus?

10:31.631 --> 10:33.533
No pooping on the bus, Nattie.

10:33.533 --> 10:35.201
Nattie, you didn't
poop on the bus, right?

10:35.201 --> 10:38.905

you rubbed it on your back.

10:52.919 --> 10:54.320
And now, you're saying
that you're rubbing

it on your inner thighs.

10:55.655 --> 10:56.456
NATTIE: Bryan, I--

10:56.456 --> 10:58.324

Hi!

11:48.141 --> 11:49.709
It's good to meet you.

11:49.709 --> 11:51.211
Today, I'm meeting Alexis.

11:51.211 --> 11:54.314
And I am granting my
very first make-a-wish.

11:54.314 --> 11:56.449
One of the coolest things
about being a WWE diva

11:56.449 --> 11:58.151
is the reach that we have.

11:58.151 --> 12:00.620
It's farther than being
in a wrestling ring.

12:00.620 --> 12:02.956
Alexis has a neurological issue.

12:02.956 --> 12:05.858
And she is a very special
little girl that has

12:05.858 --> 12:07.227
gone through a lot in her life.

12:07.227 --> 12:08.695
I really want to
make this moment

12:08.695 --> 12:10.430
something she'll never forget.

12:10.430 --> 12:12.398
When I found out that
you wanted to meet me,

12:12.398 --> 12:14.367
I was extremely honored.

12:14.367 --> 12:15.134
Thank you so much.

12:15.134 --> 12:17.103
And I have something that
I wanted to give you.

12:17.103 --> 12:21.608
This is the jacket that I
wore in Wrestlemania 25.

12:21.608 --> 12:23.776
And that was my very
first Wrestlemania.

12:23.776 --> 12:24.911
I want you to have this.

12:24.911 --> 12:26.279
My ring gear is very special.

12:26.279 --> 12:28.915
Every single thing that I've
worn in the ring has a story.

12:28.915 --> 12:29.716
But you know what?

12:29.716 --> 12:31.584
This jacket doesn't mean
anything in my closet.

12:31.584 --> 12:33.853
It means more for
Alexis to have it.

12:33.853 --> 12:36.556
And it'll be something that
I can remember forever.

12:36.556 --> 12:39.892
And she'll have it for
the rest of her life too.

12:39.892 --> 12:41.628
Oh, so you're a big fan of WWE?

12:41.628 --> 12:42.595
Mm-hm.

Future Diva's Champion.

Hey, girl.

12:55.642 --> 12:56.442
What you got?

12:56.442 --> 12:58.978
I have a little
question for you.

12:58.978 --> 13:00.880
When I'm with Fandango, I
rent my outfits or whatever.

13:00.880 --> 13:02.048
And they're like--
SANDRA: Yeah.

13:02.048 --> 13:03.416
---glamorous.
And they're so awesome.

13:03.416 --> 13:04.550
And they're cut.

13:04.550 --> 13:05.451
And it's barely there.

13:05.451 --> 13:06.552
Yes,
-And I noticed.

13:06.552 --> 13:07.353
I noticed.

13:07.353 --> 13:10.490
Well, so, then I just had
to throw something together

13:10.490 --> 13:12.292
really quick when
I had the matches.

13:12.292 --> 13:13.259
And so, I have this.

13:13.259 --> 13:15.728
But this covers everything.

13:15.728 --> 13:21.834
So I need to know how I can make
this a little more revealing.

13:21.834 --> 13:25.104
Being a WWE diva, I
work hard on my body.

13:25.104 --> 13:26.939
So of course, I
want to show it off.

13:26.939 --> 13:29.008
My ideal costume
would be something

13:29.008 --> 13:31.177
that covers everything
it needs to,

13:31.177 --> 13:33.646
but also shows off my assets.

13:35.982 --> 13:37.950

13:37.950 --> 13:39.619
I mean, even just
what I'm wearing now

13:39.619 --> 13:40.887
is more revealing than this.

come out with Fandango, I'm in,

OK, I'm telling you.

a little cut somewhere.

Nikki Bella in control here.

16:41.767 --> 16:43.069
Here comes Brie Bella.

16:43.069 --> 16:44.637
ANNOUNCER: Oh!

16:44.637 --> 16:45.438
Oh!

16:45.438 --> 16:48.007
ANNOUNCER: And
Aksana, and Natalya.

16:50.610 --> 16:53.446
Tamina caught by surprise!

16:53.446 --> 16:54.413
[CHEERS]

16:54.413 --> 16:55.414
[BELL RINGS]

16:55.414 --> 16:57.216
[MUSIC] You can look,
but you can't touch.

17:08.094 --> 17:10.863
I had a bird [BLEEP]
on my face one time.

17:10.863 --> 17:11.830
[LAUGHTER]

17:11.830 --> 17:12.632
Ew.

17:12.632 --> 17:13.833
I was driving.

17:13.833 --> 17:15.468
And the sun-roof was open.
And it just said--

17:15.468 --> 17:16.402
Oh my god.

17:16.402 --> 17:18.871
I was just riding,
and it said, poop-poop.

17:18.871 --> 17:20.873
I betcha it was,
like, on my eye.

17:20.873 --> 17:22.575
[LAUGHTER]

17:22.575 --> 17:24.042
That happened to
me one time too.

17:24.042 --> 17:25.310
I get bird [BLEEP]
top of my head.

17:25.310 --> 17:26.579
JON: It's supposed
to be good luck.

17:26.579 --> 17:30.816
Tonight is the last
night of our road trip.

17:30.816 --> 17:31.884
Thank you.

17:31.884 --> 17:32.685
Girl, zip.

17:32.685 --> 17:34.086
Upp, nope.

17:34.086 --> 17:35.888
Girl, bye.

17:35.888 --> 17:38.391
I love all the girls
and all their guys.

17:38.391 --> 17:43.362
But when we're in a small little
space, I can't stand them.

17:43.362 --> 17:44.697
JON: Let's have a onesie party.

17:44.697 --> 17:45.498
It's not sexy.
But--

17:45.498 --> 17:46.399
It's not about being sexy.

17:46.399 --> 17:47.366
It's about being comfortable.

17:47.366 --> 17:48.134
Yeah, girl.

17:48.134 --> 17:50.870
Why is it that you've
been wearing the same thing

17:50.870 --> 17:51.671
for three days in a row?

17:51.671 --> 17:53.573
Because I wanted to pack light.

17:53.573 --> 17:55.575
That trick where it
unbuttons where the ass comes.

17:55.575 --> 17:58.578
I just want to, like, [BLEEP]
you know, just zip it down.

17:58.578 --> 17:59.378
You know what I mean?

17:59.378 --> 18:00.479
Jon, you're really horny.

18:00.479 --> 18:01.280
You're like--

18:01.280 --> 18:02.248
You're a horny dude.

18:06.085 --> 18:09.121
BRIE: You guys had to see
what I found on the bus today.

18:09.121 --> 18:10.089
CAMERON: What?

18:10.089 --> 18:12.592
I walked in on the bus.

18:12.592 --> 18:15.928
And Uuuss was sitting
right where Trinity's at.

18:15.928 --> 18:18.598
Trinity was straddling him.

18:18.598 --> 18:19.465
Oh my gosh!

18:19.465 --> 18:20.900
BRIE: Yes, they
were getting it on,

18:20.900 --> 18:22.368
exactly where Trin's sitting.

18:22.368 --> 18:24.670
You were trying to
have sex on my bus.

18:24.670 --> 18:25.805
-Yes.
-No!

18:25.805 --> 18:26.606
No.

18:26.606 --> 18:29.642
BRYAN: You just said yes!

18:29.642 --> 18:33.112
You guys have broken all
the rules on this bus--

18:33.112 --> 18:34.513
NATTIE: All right, guys.

18:34.513 --> 18:38.918
---the erection rule, the
pooping on the bus rule.

18:38.918 --> 18:40.653
And although this
has been fun, I'm

18:40.653 --> 18:44.190
pretty sure this is the last
time I'm going to do this.

18:44.190 --> 18:47.193
Sorry, Bryan.

18:47.193 --> 18:48.361
Well, I know he's
mad at you guys.

18:48.361 --> 18:49.929
Because I know I didn't
break any of the rules.

18:49.929 --> 18:51.263
TJ, you're a goody-two-shoes.

18:51.263 --> 18:52.932
JON: [STAMMERING] We,
technically, didn't

18:52.932 --> 18:54.834
break a rule, technically.

18:54.834 --> 18:57.103
Rule was, there's no
erections on the bus.

18:57.103 --> 18:59.872
There was no erection--

18:59.872 --> 19:02.208
Really?

19:02.208 --> 19:03.576
No you didn't.

19:03.576 --> 19:04.543
[LAUGHTER]

19:14.220 --> 19:16.355
NATTIE: Guys, I
think we are here.

19:16.355 --> 19:18.691
TJ, chop, chop.

19:18.691 --> 19:20.660
CAMERON: What if I fell
down the stairs right now?

19:20.660 --> 19:21.460
Would you help me, TJ?

19:21.460 --> 19:22.261
Or would you laugh?

19:22.261 --> 19:23.396
Naw, I would help.

19:23.396 --> 19:25.731
Yeah, you'd probably laugh
first and then help me.

19:25.731 --> 19:26.532
TJ: Maybe.

19:31.671 --> 19:32.772
Do you want some fruit?

19:32.772 --> 19:34.807
Nope, I'm just going to
get some of that salad.

19:34.807 --> 19:37.476
Actually, I wasn't
going to eat fruit today.

19:37.476 --> 19:38.277
Why?

19:38.277 --> 19:39.111
The sugars.

19:39.111 --> 19:42.281
Because I want to, like,
John Nickels diet thing.

19:42.281 --> 19:43.082
Yeah.

19:43.082 --> 19:44.216
Isn't that a good idea?

19:44.216 --> 19:45.017
Yeah.

19:45.017 --> 19:47.420
Not as good as what our wedding
invitations are going to look

19:47.420 --> 19:48.220
like.

19:48.220 --> 19:49.555
I'm so excited.

19:49.555 --> 19:52.291
And I paid to get them
rushed, which cost a lot.

19:52.291 --> 19:53.092
But--

19:53.092 --> 19:55.327
How much?

19:55.327 --> 19:56.262
All together?

19:56.262 --> 19:57.963
Yes.

19:57.963 --> 19:59.098
Like, $1,200-- $1,300--

19:59.098 --> 20:00.833
$1,200!

20:00.833 --> 20:03.936
You're the one who wanted so
badly real wood invitations.

20:03.936 --> 20:05.104
I did.

20:05.104 --> 20:05.905
What's up?

20:05.905 --> 20:07.506
What's up, Nicole.
How are you?

20:07.506 --> 20:08.808
-[INAUDIBLE]
-Good.

20:08.808 --> 20:09.608
Just hanging out?

20:09.608 --> 20:10.409
BRIE: Yeah.

20:10.409 --> 20:11.477
Exhausted.

20:11.477 --> 20:13.979
We thought we'd be
more rested on the bus.

20:13.979 --> 20:15.347
But we feel more tired.

20:15.347 --> 20:17.016
It's because Brie
invited all the people.

20:17.016 --> 20:17.817
NIKKI: Yes.

20:17.817 --> 20:19.018
And the people are loud.
BRIE: Yeah.

20:19.018 --> 20:20.019
NIKKI: People get
on a bus, and they

20:20.019 --> 20:21.153
think it's, like, party time.

20:21.153 --> 20:22.254
I don't think
it's a party time.

20:22.254 --> 20:24.023
I was even shocked when
you wanted to get a bus.

20:24.023 --> 20:25.491
I didn't want a bus.

20:25.491 --> 20:27.593
Brie is the one
who wants the bus.

20:27.593 --> 20:28.394
Sick.

20:28.394 --> 20:29.695
It smells like fish.

20:29.695 --> 20:30.796
NIKKI: It does smell like fish.

20:30.796 --> 20:32.865
It came when you walked up.

20:32.865 --> 20:33.999
So it's possible that--

20:33.999 --> 20:34.800
Ooh, Bryan!

20:34.800 --> 20:37.169
BRYAN: --are the one who
brought the fish smell.

20:37.169 --> 20:39.271
NIKKI: I should throw a
freakin' pineapple at your head.

20:39.271 --> 20:41.907
BRIE: No, don't throw a
pineapple at my fiance's head.

20:41.907 --> 20:43.809
NIKKI: Don't you love how
she, like, put in fiance?

20:43.809 --> 20:45.211
Like, I know you're the fiance.
-Right.

20:45.211 --> 20:46.779
NIKKI: What if I started
crying right now.

20:46.779 --> 20:47.780
You'd feel so bad.

20:47.780 --> 20:50.683
Well, I'd give your Bryan's new
shirt to wipe your tears with.

20:50.683 --> 20:53.786
Isn't that cute.

20:53.786 --> 20:56.288
Anyways, I just found
out we have a photo

20:56.288 --> 20:57.890
shoot next week with Summer.

20:57.890 --> 21:00.092
Weird, Summer
actually came up to me.

21:00.092 --> 21:01.360
What do you mean,
she came up to you?

21:01.360 --> 21:02.161
She came up to me.

21:02.161 --> 21:04.797
And she was like,
hey, I just want

21:04.797 --> 21:06.732
you know that I
care what you think

21:06.732 --> 21:10.402
about people thinking I've slept
with somebody, or what-not.

21:10.402 --> 21:11.203
NIKKI: What?

21:11.203 --> 21:12.972
Yeah, it was really weird.

21:12.972 --> 21:16.742
I felt awkward when
everyone had brought up

21:16.742 --> 21:19.578
the whole rumors--
there's rumors about me--

21:19.578 --> 21:21.714
and, like, who in the
WWE have you slept with.

21:21.714 --> 21:23.682
I know girls are going
to talk, and we're petty.

21:23.682 --> 21:25.284
But I care what you think.

21:25.284 --> 21:26.585
Thanks for having
this talk with me.

21:26.585 --> 21:27.453
-Yeah.
-OK.

21:27.453 --> 21:28.354
-Bye.
-Cool.

21:28.354 --> 21:28.988
-All right.
-Thanks.

21:28.988 --> 21:29.789
See you later.

21:29.789 --> 21:31.891
Bye.

21:31.891 --> 21:33.159
BRIE: Are you serious?

21:33.159 --> 21:34.059
That's super weird.

21:34.059 --> 21:35.895
You mean, about when we
were playing Truth or Dare?

21:35.895 --> 21:36.695
Yeah.

21:36.695 --> 21:38.631
And then, like, you know how
I don't hug anybody, right?

21:38.631 --> 21:39.431
She's like--

21:42.568 --> 21:43.836
BRIE: She's such a [BLEEP] more.

21:43.836 --> 21:47.339
Dude, Jon was icing and doing
STEM in the trainer's room.

21:47.339 --> 21:49.642
And she went in there and
said such inappropriate stuff

21:49.642 --> 21:50.442
to him.

21:50.442 --> 21:51.877
You've got to be
[BLEEP] kidding me.

21:51.877 --> 21:52.678
NIKKI: No.

21:52.678 --> 21:53.846
So obviously, I walk over.

21:53.846 --> 21:55.447
And he's like, that
girl just made the most

21:55.447 --> 21:56.882
inappropriate comment to me.

21:56.882 --> 21:59.451
I confronted her and put
an end to it right away.

21:59.451 --> 22:01.387
So it doesn't shock
me that she did that.

22:01.387 --> 22:03.455
Because she does it
to everyone's guy.

22:03.455 --> 22:06.458
BRIE: So she said that she
only cared about what you think

22:06.458 --> 22:07.526
and she lost sleep--

22:07.526 --> 22:09.228
I don't know if she
said she lost sleep.

22:09.228 --> 22:11.096
She wished she had
sleep with Bryan.

22:11.096 --> 22:12.998
That's not cool Bryan.

22:12.998 --> 22:13.799
I know.

22:13.799 --> 22:14.600
That's messed up.

22:14.600 --> 22:15.568
I would say something to her.

22:15.568 --> 22:16.836
I'd go say something
to her right now.

22:16.836 --> 22:18.404
I will.

22:18.404 --> 22:20.706
I have heard all these
rumors that Summer

22:20.706 --> 22:22.274
talks dirty to the boys.

22:22.274 --> 22:23.776
I didn't want to believe that.

22:23.776 --> 22:24.743
But now, I do.

22:24.743 --> 22:27.079
I'm always trying to
be the bigger person.

22:27.079 --> 22:29.782
But when it comes to my man, no.

22:32.484 --> 22:34.520
If you think I'm
stupid, I'm not.

22:34.520 --> 22:36.922
It's not my fault that you're
insecure in your relationship.

22:36.922 --> 22:38.724
You are misunderstanding
the way you are.

22:38.724 --> 22:39.525
And guess what?

22:39.525 --> 22:42.962
You're going to be really
embarrassed, honey.

22:42.962 --> 22:44.163
[BELL RINGS]

22:44.964 --> 22:48.634
This is a really good match.

22:48.634 --> 22:49.802
That's not good.

22:56.675 --> 22:58.577
I'm going to find her.

23:01.947 --> 23:03.849
NIKKI: I almost want
to go watch from afar.

23:03.849 --> 23:05.251
You want to go peek?

23:05.251 --> 23:06.185
I kind of do, yeah.

23:06.185 --> 23:07.086
NIKKI: Yeah, let's go peek.

23:07.086 --> 23:07.887
Summer--

23:07.887 --> 23:08.687
Yeah?

23:08.687 --> 23:10.222
Can I-- can I talk to you?

23:10.222 --> 23:11.523
Yeah.

23:11.523 --> 23:14.894
Here, over here.

23:14.894 --> 23:20.065
So what is this I hear that you
pulled Brian aside privately?

23:20.065 --> 23:21.934
I just pulled him aside
and thanked him for the bus.

23:21.934 --> 23:22.701
And then--

23:22.701 --> 23:24.336
You didn't thank
me for the bus.

23:24.336 --> 23:25.137
My idea.

23:25.137 --> 23:27.640
I was the one who wanted
you guys on there.

23:27.640 --> 23:28.774
SUMMER RAE: When
I had saw him, he

23:28.774 --> 23:29.842
was just going down the hall.

23:29.842 --> 23:31.110
And so I was like, uhhh!

23:31.110 --> 23:32.444
Thanks for the bus, like.

23:32.444 --> 23:34.413
And like, oh yeah,
about the rumor,

23:34.413 --> 23:35.748
I can't believe you
thought it was true.

23:35.748 --> 23:36.548
Like, it was--

23:36.548 --> 23:39.485
If you think I'm
stupid, I'm not.

23:39.485 --> 23:40.286
What?

23:40.286 --> 23:44.256
You never pull someone's
[BLEEP] man aside privately

23:44.256 --> 23:46.825
and ask his thoughts
on who you slept with.

23:46.825 --> 23:49.995
That is a slutty,
classless thing to do.

23:49.995 --> 23:51.196
Yeah, I'm single.

23:51.196 --> 23:52.665
And yeah, I flirt.

23:52.665 --> 23:54.033
Who cares?
I'm not a whore.

23:54.033 --> 23:54.967
No, no, no.

23:54.967 --> 23:56.302
I was just asking him.

23:56.302 --> 23:57.836
For me, I just-- because
I know people are

23:57.836 --> 23:58.871
going to start rumors about me.

23:58.871 --> 23:59.872
I just was like--

23:59.872 --> 24:01.907
No, it's not rumors,
Summer, at all.

24:01.907 --> 24:03.943
This is the perception
people have of you.

24:03.943 --> 24:05.878
You walk around these
hallways, flirting,

24:05.878 --> 24:06.946
putting yourself out there.

24:06.946 --> 24:09.214
And let me tell you something,
a lot of those guys--

24:09.214 --> 24:11.717
if their wives were here, you
would not be acting like that.

24:11.717 --> 24:12.017
You know what?

24:12.017 --> 24:13.419
I can walk up to a
man and they don't

24:13.419 --> 24:14.887

I flirting with Bryan at all.

that you're even going to come

24:26.265 --> 24:27.066

-I don't give a [BLEEP].

to do with what--

embarrassed, honey.

letting me talk.

her voice or anything.

she's taking this out on me.

Like, I told her.

25:17.282 --> 25:18.917
I was like, maybe
you're insecure

25:18.917 --> 25:19.952
with your relationship.

25:22.654 --> 25:24.189
I honestly think
Summer might have

25:24.189 --> 25:25.958
crossed the line a little bit.

25:25.958 --> 25:28.727
Because she really
shouldn't care too much what

Bryan thinks about
anything about her really.

25:31.930 --> 25:34.066

just kept my mouth shut.

It looked like you got pissed.

I don't know.

And I bitched her
out pretty bad.

anything went in her head.

25:56.255 --> 25:57.122

25:57.122 --> 25:58.090
She's just really rude and--

25:58.090 --> 25:59.391
It's like, just
apologize and say you

25:59.391 --> 26:00.292
shouldn't have said that.

26:00.292 --> 26:01.093
Right?

26:01.093 --> 26:03.128
I totally agree.

26:03.128 --> 26:05.064
I just see two different
sides to Summer.

26:05.064 --> 26:07.199
It's like, I see
this sweet girl.

26:07.199 --> 26:11.770
And then, I see this
crazy flirtatious girl.

26:11.770 --> 26:14.506
It's like, she kind of
becomes a different person.

about how I bitched out Summer.

I want to, like, hug everybody.

32:51.703 --> 32:53.338
Congratulations.

32:53.338 --> 32:54.473
Thank you so much.

32:54.473 --> 32:56.441
NATTIE: So when are you
getting your action figure?

32:56.441 --> 32:57.275
SUMMER RAE: I don't know.

32:57.275 --> 32:59.411
I mean, I'm just happy
that Fandango got his.

32:59.411 --> 33:00.679
NATTIE: I have had a few, yes.

33:00.679 --> 33:02.481
I was saying to Bill, I
have them on my walls.

33:02.481 --> 33:03.281
I love this.

33:03.281 --> 33:04.749
Even this picture, I love too.

33:04.749 --> 33:06.284
SUMMER RAE: How long ago
is that picture from?

33:06.284 --> 33:07.252
A couple years ago?

33:07.252 --> 33:08.053
You look great.

33:08.053 --> 33:09.120
You look super young, Nattie.

33:09.120 --> 33:10.188
Thank you, Summer.
SUMMER RAE: Yeah.

33:10.188 --> 33:10.989
I appreciate it.

33:10.989 --> 33:12.757
We're only one year apart, so--

33:12.757 --> 33:15.227
The Photoshop team's
really good then.

33:15.227 --> 33:16.528
Well, no, I look--
I mean, I think

33:16.528 --> 33:17.929
we all look pretty lifelike.

33:17.929 --> 33:18.730
SUMMER RAE: Yeah.

33:18.730 --> 33:21.199
But definitely, you look better
in the toy than in real life,

33:21.199 --> 33:22.634
you know?

33:22.634 --> 33:23.401
Yeah.

33:23.401 --> 33:26.605
My fist is even clenched, like
I'm going to knock someone out.

33:26.605 --> 33:28.874
Don't [BLEEP] with me anybody.

33:28.874 --> 33:30.575
Summer, can I talk
to you for a second?

33:30.575 --> 33:31.376
Yeah.

33:31.376 --> 33:35.313
Oh my god, you guys!

33:35.313 --> 33:36.982
Summer, you're acting
really unprofessional.

33:36.982 --> 33:37.983
What are you talking about?

33:37.983 --> 33:39.451
You know exactly what
I'm talking about.

33:39.451 --> 33:41.720
No, I have no idea what
you're talking about.

33:41.720 --> 33:42.921
I love this doll.

33:42.921 --> 33:43.722
It's so cute.

33:43.722 --> 33:44.523
It's an action-figure.

33:44.523 --> 33:46.291
You know exactly what
I'm talking about.

33:46.291 --> 33:48.193
Nattie, this is [INAUDIBLE].

33:48.193 --> 33:49.327
NATTIE: I've had
enough of Summer.

33:49.327 --> 33:51.329
And I have no respect for her.

33:51.329 --> 33:53.164
It's like, there's
no trust there.

33:53.164 --> 33:54.432
And it's just like
any relationship.

33:54.432 --> 33:57.168
If there's no trust
there, it's done.

34:01.006 --> 34:01.840
We're a package deal.

34:01.840 --> 34:02.641
Right.

34:02.641 --> 34:03.441
FANDANGO: So--

34:03.441 --> 34:04.876
She's constantly
spreading her legs and--

34:04.876 --> 34:05.677
What's going on?

34:05.677 --> 34:07.078
We're just talking.

34:07.078 --> 34:08.179
Are you kidding me?

34:08.179 --> 34:10.282
Now that she's brought
Fandango into it,

34:10.282 --> 34:11.815
she's crossed the line.

34:11.815 --> 34:15.320
She doesn't even need
to be talking to you.

34:15.320 --> 34:17.054
You guys don't have
to like each other.

34:17.054 --> 34:19.190
But just as long as we keep
it professional at work--

34:19.190 --> 34:20.292
I tried to apologize to you.

34:20.292 --> 34:22.159
And you just walked
away from me.

34:22.159 --> 34:23.828
I ain't got [BLEEP] to say.

34:30.702 --> 34:31.670
Oh shoot.

34:31.670 --> 34:33.237
Look at you with the
little red cover.

34:33.237 --> 34:35.574
One, two, three.

34:35.574 --> 34:36.373
[CAMERA CLICK]

34:36.373 --> 34:37.242
Perfect.

34:37.242 --> 34:38.577
EVA MARIE: Nice
to meet you guys.

34:38.577 --> 34:39.476
Enjoy the show.

34:42.380 --> 34:43.181
Brie-zee!

34:43.181 --> 34:45.183
Hey, what's up?

34:45.183 --> 34:47.719
Nothing.

34:47.719 --> 34:50.121
How's Bryan?

34:50.121 --> 34:51.289
-He's doing better.
-Yeah?

34:51.289 --> 34:52.290
BRIE: I just feel bad.

34:52.290 --> 34:54.993
Because, you know,
he's still recovering.

34:54.993 --> 34:56.728
And he's just so exhausted.

34:56.728 --> 34:57.696
So-- I don't know.

34:57.696 --> 34:58.697
That sucks.

34:58.697 --> 35:00.231
Yeah.

35:00.231 --> 35:01.766
Even though Bryan
had to go home,

35:01.766 --> 35:03.368
the show still must go on.

35:03.368 --> 35:05.270
But it is the last show.

35:05.270 --> 35:09.007
And I can go back home right
after this and be there.

35:09.007 --> 35:11.643
I was thinking that, I might
have only been on the bus

35:11.643 --> 35:14.079
half the time, but
the drama on there

35:14.079 --> 35:16.881
and how the girls are with each
other, it's not professional.

35:16.881 --> 35:18.249
It's a toxic environment.

35:18.249 --> 35:19.117
It's not healthy.

35:19.117 --> 35:22.053
And I just think we need
to talk to them, you know?

35:22.053 --> 35:24.656
Oh man, there's
been a lot of drama.

35:24.656 --> 35:26.925
Now you know why John and I
like to be on our bus alone.

35:26.925 --> 35:28.326
Oh, I know why.

35:28.326 --> 35:30.028
There's one I need to talk to.

35:30.028 --> 35:30.862
OK.

35:30.862 --> 35:32.263
Nicole wants us
all to get together.

35:32.263 --> 35:33.064
Um, girl, bye.

35:33.064 --> 35:34.366
I was going to talk
about those boots.

35:34.366 --> 35:35.333
How cute they are?

35:35.333 --> 35:36.534
Yeah.

35:36.534 --> 35:40.305
Nattie, Eva, Summer--

35:40.305 --> 35:41.740
Oh, are we in trouble?

35:41.740 --> 35:42.941
By Nicole.

35:42.941 --> 35:43.742
Oh!

35:43.742 --> 35:45.443
Nicole wants us
all to get together.

35:45.443 --> 35:47.445
I definitely think
the bus brought

35:47.445 --> 35:49.047
out the worst in everyone.

35:49.047 --> 35:50.982
And I want to just get
all the girls together

35:50.982 --> 35:52.517
and just let all this stuff go.

35:52.517 --> 35:54.252
I told everyone how we feel.

35:54.252 --> 35:57.122
And let's just solve this.

35:57.122 --> 35:58.623
I would love to go first.

35:58.623 --> 36:02.627
Um, I think the thing that's
weighing heaviest on my mind

36:02.627 --> 36:04.996
is this stuff with you, Brie.

36:04.996 --> 36:08.633
I think, at work, I can kind
of tone certain things down.

36:08.633 --> 36:12.971
And I just wanted you to know
that I am just extremely sorry.

36:12.971 --> 36:15.140
It really has been bothering me.

36:15.140 --> 36:17.776
Yeah, well, and just after
thinking-- because, I know,

36:17.776 --> 36:21.179
at first, I didn't want to
listen to any of your [BLEEP].

36:21.179 --> 36:23.148
You know, there's just situation
that will always happen.

36:23.148 --> 36:24.082
None of us are perfect.

36:24.082 --> 36:25.150
We're all human beings.

36:25.150 --> 36:26.584
I need to give you
more time and, like,

36:26.584 --> 36:28.153
really see who you really are.

36:28.153 --> 36:29.320
And so, apology accepted.
-Wow.

36:29.320 --> 36:30.255
Now we're getting somewhere.

36:30.255 --> 36:31.489
And I'm sorry for
bitching you out.

36:31.489 --> 36:33.725
Next?

36:33.725 --> 36:34.526
NIKKI: Eva?

36:34.526 --> 36:35.894
Ariane?

36:35.894 --> 36:38.997
I ain't got [BLEEP] to say.

36:38.997 --> 36:41.499
CAMERON: At the end of the day,
I honestly felt like [BLEEP].

36:41.499 --> 36:43.068
If I would have known
that those pictures

36:43.068 --> 36:45.136
were linked to something like
that, then I would have never.

36:45.136 --> 36:47.072
And I just want to
apologize for that.

36:47.072 --> 36:49.474
I have a past myself
that never was clear.

36:49.474 --> 36:52.677
So I get when things don't end
up seeming how they appear.

36:52.677 --> 36:54.212
And I tried to apologize to you.

36:54.212 --> 36:55.680
And you just walked
away from me.

36:55.680 --> 36:58.116
EVA MARIE: I was more
hurt by the actions of you

36:58.116 --> 36:59.217
just trying to embarrass me.

36:59.217 --> 37:01.586
It's more the fact of
the matter of doing

37:01.586 --> 37:03.455
something shady behind my back.

37:03.455 --> 37:04.622
That's what bothered me.
And I--

37:04.622 --> 37:05.757
CAMERON: I think
I was just upset.

37:05.757 --> 37:07.625
Because, like, I was
trying to have my moment

37:07.625 --> 37:09.260
and tell you about the
cover of my magazine.

37:09.260 --> 37:10.695
And you just had
to shoot that down.

37:10.695 --> 37:12.964
Like, why can't we all
bring something to the table

37:12.964 --> 37:14.165
to say what we're happy about?

37:14.165 --> 37:14.966
You know what I mean?

37:14.966 --> 37:17.402
No, and I totally think it's
dope that you got the cover

37:17.402 --> 37:18.570
of "Rolling Out" magazine.

37:18.570 --> 37:20.071
And it's more so my insecurity.

37:20.071 --> 37:22.140
Because I am so new that
it's like, wait, you guys.

37:22.140 --> 37:26.277
I'm trying just as much
to get on you guys' level.

37:26.277 --> 37:28.012
Sometimes, when
I get something,

37:28.012 --> 37:29.347
I almost don't want
to talk about it.

37:29.347 --> 37:30.482
Because I don't want to hurt
other people's feelings,

37:30.482 --> 37:31.783
in case they don't
have something.

37:31.783 --> 37:33.518
But I should
probably want to toot

37:33.518 --> 37:36.421
my own horn a little bit more,
the way that you do sometimes.

37:36.421 --> 37:37.856
OK.

37:37.856 --> 37:39.257
About what?
I have nothing.

37:39.257 --> 37:40.625
I don't have magazine
covers or anything.

37:40.625 --> 37:42.393
NATTIE: Actually, I want--
I do want to clear the air

37:42.393 --> 37:44.429
a little bit with the two of us.

37:44.429 --> 37:46.397
Because the issues that
we've been having, like,

37:46.397 --> 37:47.165
are affecting--

37:47.165 --> 37:48.333
SUMMER RAE: What are our issues?

37:48.333 --> 37:49.667
The fact that you
don't know our issues

37:49.667 --> 37:50.568
is actually quite alarming.

37:50.568 --> 37:51.970
I don't have an
issues with you.

37:51.970 --> 37:53.838
I've always respected
you and been nice.

37:53.838 --> 37:54.939
And you're the
one that's running

37:54.939 --> 37:55.907
around saying stuff about me.

37:55.907 --> 37:57.575
I don't even like sharing
a locker room with you.

37:57.575 --> 37:58.476
Like, I feel uncomfortable.

37:58.476 --> 37:59.277
I feel--

37:59.277 --> 38:00.845
OK, and why is that?

38:00.845 --> 38:02.947
You're-- like, you're accusing
me of a lot of things.

38:02.947 --> 38:03.782
And I'm asking why.

38:03.782 --> 38:06.284
And you're giving me nothing.

38:06.284 --> 38:07.519
I'm trying to be diplomatic.

38:07.519 --> 38:08.520
That's what I'm trying to do.

38:08.520 --> 38:09.621
I want to move past all of it.

38:09.621 --> 38:10.989
Because I just feel like--

38:10.989 --> 38:12.423
That's great.
That's great news to me.

38:12.423 --> 38:13.224
Me too.

38:13.224 --> 38:14.959
I don't know what I've
ever done wrong to you.

38:14.959 --> 38:17.128
I feel like I've
always been respectful.

38:17.128 --> 38:19.264
I feel like you're
completely full of [BLEEP].

38:19.264 --> 38:20.832
SUMMER RAE: OK, well at
least that's something.

38:20.832 --> 38:22.066
EVA MARIE: You guys
just get over it.

38:22.066 --> 38:24.836
Kiss and make up and move on.

38:24.836 --> 38:26.571
You guys don't have
to like each other.

38:26.571 --> 38:28.706
But just as long as we keep
it professional at work.

38:28.706 --> 38:31.109
Like, so we're not uncomfortable
in the locker room.

38:31.109 --> 38:31.943
I agree.

38:31.943 --> 38:32.744
NIKKI: Yay.

38:32.744 --> 38:34.946
BRIE: All right, now
let's get to work.

38:34.946 --> 38:35.747
NIKKI: Get to work.

38:35.747 --> 38:36.848
I know some people
have matches.

38:36.848 --> 38:37.916
Let's get it!

38:37.916 --> 38:38.783
NIKKI: Thank you, guys.

38:43.822 --> 38:46.257
Ugh, it's been such a long day.

38:46.257 --> 38:47.058
It's been, like--

38:47.058 --> 38:48.126
What do you got tonight?

38:48.126 --> 38:49.794
Oh, we have a mat--
a six-girl tag.

38:49.794 --> 38:51.429
Actually, Summer was
supposed to be in the match.

38:51.429 --> 38:52.897
-Oh, how's she doing?
-Right.

38:52.897 --> 38:53.865
Like, we're a package deal.

38:53.865 --> 38:54.666
Right.

38:54.666 --> 38:56.534
So does she get along
or-- with you guys?

38:56.534 --> 38:58.236
So in a nutshell,
she's constantly

38:58.236 --> 39:01.439
posing like this, to get
attention around the guys.

39:01.439 --> 39:03.141
She's very flirtatious.

39:03.141 --> 39:04.108
And suggestive.

39:04.108 --> 39:07.812
TJ, does this hold look right?

39:07.812 --> 39:08.613
Yeah.

39:08.613 --> 39:11.015
Look, and then I'll
spread my leg like this

39:11.015 --> 39:12.917
and, then, throw myself
out there and act

39:12.917 --> 39:14.919
like it's just wrestling.

39:14.919 --> 39:18.223
So the thing is that you may
have done NXT and you may have

39:18.223 --> 39:21.626
paid your dues in the ring, but
having no etiquette and being--

39:21.626 --> 39:23.995
like I said, spreading your
legs and acting like you're--

39:23.995 --> 39:26.130
Hey, I've been looking
for you everywhere.

39:26.130 --> 39:27.565
What's going on?

39:27.565 --> 39:29.100
We're just talking,
just everything.

39:29.100 --> 39:29.901
You know.

39:29.901 --> 39:31.202
I will catch you
in a little bit.

39:31.202 --> 39:32.737
OK.

39:32.737 --> 39:35.006
What was she talking about?

39:35.006 --> 39:38.209
Well, she was just telling
me how, sometimes, maybe you

39:38.209 --> 39:39.577
like to get attention
from everybody

39:39.577 --> 39:42.547
and stretching and doing your
poses in front of the girl's

39:42.547 --> 39:44.182
boyfriends and stuff like that.

39:44.182 --> 39:45.416
Are you kidding me?

39:45.416 --> 39:47.685
Usually, I could care less
what girls think about me.

39:47.685 --> 39:49.287
But she involve my partner.

39:49.287 --> 39:51.689
She doesn't even need
to be talking to you.

39:51.689 --> 39:52.690
She needs to talk to me.

39:52.690 --> 39:54.759
Now that she's brought
Fandango into it,

39:54.759 --> 39:56.127
she's crossed the line.

39:56.127 --> 39:59.631
The last thing I need,
Summer, is drama with my career

39:59.631 --> 40:00.465
and my relationship.

40:00.465 --> 40:01.566
Totally, yeah.
At work, I never--

40:01.566 --> 40:02.533
You need to talk to Nattie.

40:02.533 --> 40:04.068
You need to talk to Nattie
and figure this out.

40:04.068 --> 40:05.136
I agree.
But it won't be at work.

40:05.136 --> 40:05.937
I'll tell you that much.

40:05.937 --> 40:07.305
OK, well let's do this thing.

40:10.241 --> 40:12.677
[MUSIC PLAYING]

40:24.389 --> 40:26.157
I've been a
pushover for so long

40:26.157 --> 40:27.892
and I've always held my tongue.

40:27.892 --> 40:32.797
And I'm not going to let these
girls push me over any longer.

40:32.797 --> 40:33.731
It's game on.

40:33.731 --> 40:37.235
Because I'm over it.

40:37.235 --> 40:38.169
Hey.

40:38.169 --> 40:39.037
Hi.

40:39.037 --> 40:39.837
What are you doing here?

40:39.837 --> 40:41.306
Do you have a second?

40:54.619 --> 40:55.420
Hey.

40:55.420 --> 40:56.220
Hi.

40:56.220 --> 40:57.121
What are you doing here?

40:57.121 --> 40:58.356
Do you have a second?

40:58.356 --> 41:00.358
Are you guys supposed
to be at NXT today?

41:00.358 --> 41:01.225
Yeah, it won't take long.

41:01.225 --> 41:05.096
I'm on my way there
so-- um-- I just

41:05.096 --> 41:08.232
wanted to be adults and not
talk at work with everyone

41:08.232 --> 41:11.703
else around and the
whole gossipping lately.

41:11.703 --> 41:13.104
I don't have time for that.

41:13.104 --> 41:16.507
And quite frankly,
it shocks me that you

41:16.507 --> 41:18.009
even have time with that.

41:18.009 --> 41:21.479
You are such an amazing
technical wrestler.

41:21.479 --> 41:22.714
You're one of the
best girls that we

41:22.714 --> 41:23.848
have in the Divas Division.

41:23.848 --> 41:25.883
If you just actually
put all the time

41:25.883 --> 41:27.352
in that you gossip
into your career,

41:27.352 --> 41:29.087
you would be somewhere else.

41:29.087 --> 41:29.887
Are you done?

41:29.887 --> 41:30.688
Yeah.

41:30.688 --> 41:33.024
That's all I kind of
wanted to tell you.

41:33.024 --> 41:37.261
I really don't appreciate you
coming to my house unannounced.

41:37.261 --> 41:38.629
The fact that you've
been in our business

41:38.629 --> 41:41.466
for all about two seconds
and you're confronting me,

41:41.466 --> 41:43.001
somebody that's been
born and raised--

41:43.001 --> 41:44.369
Nattie, I know you have been.

41:44.369 --> 41:45.169
That's what I'm saying.

41:45.169 --> 41:47.171
Like, I respect
where you come from.

41:47.171 --> 41:49.073
You need to sit back and
think, why am I talking

41:49.073 --> 41:50.742
smack about things to people?

41:50.742 --> 41:52.176
Is it because of my
own insecurities?

41:52.176 --> 41:52.977
You know what?

41:52.977 --> 41:54.078
Look at yourself in the mirror.

41:54.078 --> 41:55.513
Take a good look at
yourself in the mirror.

41:55.513 --> 41:56.447
I'm not perfect at all.

41:56.447 --> 41:57.315
Yeah, you're not perfect.

41:57.315 --> 41:58.850
You're one of the
most phony people

41:58.850 --> 42:00.418
I've ever met in my life.

42:00.418 --> 42:03.287
I want to come here today
because I want to squash it.

42:03.287 --> 42:05.590
Summer's coming here
and acting like she wants

42:05.590 --> 42:07.025
to make things
right and that she

42:07.025 --> 42:08.526
really wants to move past this.

42:08.526 --> 42:09.827
But at the end of
the day, Summer

42:09.827 --> 42:12.597
is still not willing to
accept responsibility

42:12.597 --> 42:13.898
for anything that she's done.

42:13.898 --> 42:17.902
I've always seen
through Summer's BS.

42:17.902 --> 42:19.871
And today is no exception.

42:19.871 --> 42:22.040
Even the people at work that you
think are your friends think--

42:22.040 --> 42:25.643
I absolutely know that no
one at work is my friend.

42:25.643 --> 42:26.844
Because you have no respect.

42:26.844 --> 42:29.614
See, you are getting
so mad at the new girls.

42:29.614 --> 42:30.915
You're threatened by us.

42:30.915 --> 42:31.749
But you shouldn't be.

42:31.749 --> 42:33.017
You have it all, Nattie.

42:33.017 --> 42:33.818
Threatened?

42:33.818 --> 42:38.623
There is a reason why you have
even gotten any reaction on TV.

42:38.623 --> 42:40.124
You come out there and
you shake your ass.

42:40.124 --> 42:41.259
You practically wear nothing.

42:41.259 --> 42:42.060
Nattie--

42:42.060 --> 42:42.894
Divas are role models.

42:42.894 --> 42:43.694
Nattie, please--

42:43.694 --> 42:45.496
You're on the verge
of being a stripper.

42:45.496 --> 42:45.696
Yeah.

42:45.696 --> 42:46.497
Nattie, I understand--

42:46.497 --> 42:49.534
And there's a reason why
you're 30, Summer, and single.

42:49.534 --> 42:51.903
[GASP] Get off my property.

42:51.903 --> 42:53.371
Get off!

42:53.371 --> 42:56.641
If you ever come to my house
again, I'm calling the police.

42:56.641 --> 42:57.442
Get serious.

43:03.114 --> 43:05.116

on "Total Divas"--

43:05.116 --> 43:06.617
MAN: Roll playback.

43:06.617 --> 43:07.585
Love it.

43:07.585 --> 43:09.454
Nattie, you've got a
little bit of a nose bleed.

43:09.454 --> 43:11.255
What were you doing last night?

43:11.255 --> 43:13.524
Summer slapped me
across the face and left.

43:13.524 --> 43:16.194
Ever since Summer slapped
me, my nose is different.

43:16.194 --> 43:18.029
For safety reasons,
stay away from my face.

43:18.029 --> 43:18.930
SUMMER RAE: OK.

43:18.930 --> 43:20.264
Ooh!

43:20.264 --> 43:21.933
I know this is going
to affect my career.

43:21.933 --> 43:23.801
She needs to have
invasive surgery.

43:23.801 --> 43:26.237
Any way you look at
it, I can't do this.

43:26.237 --> 43:27.572
I don't want to be out of work.

43:27.572 --> 43:28.372
He's on the phone.

43:28.372 --> 43:30.074
When I walk up,
puts the phone away.

43:30.074 --> 43:30.875
What?

43:30.875 --> 43:33.511
I'm starting to think
he's seeing someone else.
