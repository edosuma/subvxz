WEBVTT

00:04.188 --> 00:06.978
- Oh, hey, honey. I was just...
- Shh. Where are the girls?

00:06.980 --> 00:08.520
In their rooms. Why?

00:08.522 --> 00:11.200
Okay, nice and easy,
let's sneak out to a movie,

00:11.225 --> 00:12.853
just the two of us.

00:12.855 --> 00:14.586
- I'll go get my purse.
- No, no, too risky.

00:14.611 --> 00:16.353
- We go to go now.
- Not without my purse.

00:16.355 --> 00:17.790
You don't need your
purse, I got my wallet.

00:17.815 --> 00:19.936
But I need my brush,
lipstick, concealer.

00:19.938 --> 00:20.743
What are you trying to conceal?

00:20.768 --> 00:22.552
I know what you look like.

00:22.747 --> 00:24.638
Let's go before we're late.

00:24.747 --> 00:26.235
- Late for what?
- Yeah, where are we going?

00:26.260 --> 00:27.180
- The movies.
- Nowhere.

00:27.229 --> 00:29.002
Yay!

00:29.970 --> 00:31.561
Let me just take care
of something real quick.

00:31.563 --> 00:33.822
Aaron, we're doing
stuff. You got to leave.

00:35.688 --> 00:37.561
Aaron, family. Family, Aaron.

00:37.563 --> 00:38.769
It's nice to meet you.

00:38.771 --> 00:39.858
You have a beautiful home,

00:39.874 --> 00:41.622
and you've raised a wonderful daughter.

00:41.624 --> 00:42.798
They know.

00:42.823 --> 00:44.622
I will text you later.

00:44.624 --> 00:45.772
Great.

00:46.707 --> 00:48.705
He seems nice.

00:48.707 --> 00:49.923
Yeah. He's too nice.

00:49.948 --> 00:51.498
I got to get rid of him.

00:52.054 --> 00:53.885
We spend one night
together, and now he's all,

00:54.040 --> 00:56.847
"Let's go out again and
hold hands in the park,

00:56.872 --> 00:58.970
ride the carousel, share our stories."

00:58.995 --> 01:00.791
Who wants that?

01:01.893 --> 01:02.807
I do.

01:02.877 --> 01:04.391
You just described my favorite montage

01:04.416 --> 01:06.047
in every romantic comedy.

01:06.122 --> 01:08.390
Well, that and the montage
of trying on different outfits

01:08.415 --> 01:10.908
that your boyfriend bought you
even though you're a hooker.

01:13.030 --> 01:14.900
And those snooty Beverly
Hills sales ladies...

01:14.925 --> 01:16.755
they're just jealous of what I have...

01:17.650 --> 01:19.213
I mean she has.

01:20.781 --> 01:22.779
Look, I've dated enough guys to realize

01:22.781 --> 01:24.445
they're always jerks in the end.

01:24.447 --> 01:25.738
So now I'm the jerk.

01:25.763 --> 01:26.964
I'm breaking the hearts.

01:27.211 --> 01:29.129
I'm the reason they woke
up downtown on a curb

01:29.154 --> 01:30.917
in their own vomit,
wondering how they got there.

01:30.918 --> 01:32.583
And it feels good.

01:33.038 --> 01:34.833
Martina, jump in here. Fix her.

01:35.100 --> 01:36.841
Look, honey, I understand

01:36.866 --> 01:38.749
you've been through
some bad relationships,

01:38.774 --> 01:41.522
but one day you'll meet somebody
you want to spend time with,

01:41.547 --> 01:43.507
maybe get married...

01:43.530 --> 01:44.861
raise kids with.

01:44.886 --> 01:46.863
I don't need a guy to
help me raise my kid.

01:46.888 --> 01:48.280
I've got you and Dad.

01:49.679 --> 01:52.301
This kitchen is killing me right now.

01:52.303 --> 01:54.134
Can we just go to the movies before...

01:54.136 --> 01:55.009
Hey.

01:55.034 --> 01:56.494
That happens.

01:57.412 --> 01:59.535
We're here to return your latest attempt

01:59.537 --> 02:00.826
at an anniversary gift.

02:00.828 --> 02:02.701
Yes, we don't even know what it is.

02:02.703 --> 02:04.243
Oh, it's a picture disc.

02:04.245 --> 02:06.809
We put all your photos on
it, so they'll play on your TV

02:06.834 --> 02:08.059
like a screensaver.

02:08.084 --> 02:09.753
So they all show up in order?

02:09.779 --> 02:12.481
No, they appear randomly,
so it's always a surprise.

02:12.506 --> 02:14.378
So, in one picture, I'm in my 20s,

02:14.403 --> 02:15.863
and in the next, I...

02:15.888 --> 02:18.425
Wait. How old did I tell you all I was?

02:19.935 --> 02:22.971
Anyway, Mike, the thought
doesn't even count on this one.

02:22.996 --> 02:24.276
Try again.

02:24.789 --> 02:26.396
Okay, there's two movies starting soon.

02:26.421 --> 02:28.954
One is some old-timey movie
called "The Bodyguard"...

02:28.956 --> 02:30.104
"The Bodyguard"?

02:30.129 --> 02:32.150
That's the movie we
saw on our first date.

02:32.175 --> 02:33.507
- Bob!
- What?

02:33.523 --> 02:35.244
They're talking about "The Bodyguard"!

02:35.269 --> 02:37.814
- What?
- "The Bodyguard"!

02:39.148 --> 02:41.771
That's the movie we
saw on our first date!

02:41.773 --> 02:43.479
Oh, what an unforgettable night.

02:43.651 --> 02:45.979
- I picked her up...
- No, I drove.

02:45.981 --> 02:47.812
Right, because my car was in the shop.

02:47.925 --> 02:50.812
No, because you wanted to drink.

02:50.814 --> 02:53.277
Right, booze. That sounds like me.

02:54.060 --> 02:55.182
We're going to the movies right now.

02:55.207 --> 02:56.936
- You should come with us.
- We're in.

02:57.124 --> 03:00.090
[beep] purse.

03:00.406 --> 03:03.296
You know what? We should
all go see "The Bodyguard."

03:03.321 --> 03:06.029
My first date with Alice
changed my life for the better

03:06.031 --> 03:07.404
in every single way,

03:07.406 --> 03:10.093
and I want you all to
share that memory with us.

03:10.095 --> 03:12.842
Oh, baby, you are so sweet.

03:12.867 --> 03:14.449
- Mwah.
- Okay, fine.

03:14.550 --> 03:16.068
You want an anniversary gift?

03:16.218 --> 03:16.844
This is it.

03:16.869 --> 03:17.911
We'll all go to the movies

03:17.936 --> 03:19.788
and re-create your first date with you.

03:19.813 --> 03:21.861
And from this point
forward, none of us will act

03:21.862 --> 03:23.474
like that's weird.

03:24.450 --> 03:26.591
You got a deal. We'll
pick Ethan up on the way.

03:26.616 --> 03:28.825
Yeah, because we need more people.

03:29.653 --> 03:31.671
Oh, would you go get my purse?

03:31.696 --> 03:32.803
Sure. It caused all of this.

03:32.828 --> 03:34.670
It might as well come with us.

03:40.578 --> 03:42.160
No.

03:43.078 --> 03:45.019
No.

03:46.036 --> 03:49.201
No! No! No!

03:51.000 --> 03:57.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:01.822 --> 04:03.373
Martina's with the girls.

04:03.398 --> 04:04.361
I need to talk to somebody privately,

04:04.386 --> 04:05.952
and you're the only person available.

04:06.190 --> 04:07.360
Now?

04:08.041 --> 04:10.183
I'm in the middle of the Star Jumble.

04:10.471 --> 04:12.201
"Bard Tipt."

04:12.935 --> 04:14.216
It's Brad Pitt.

04:19.517 --> 04:21.468
You've seen this one.

04:22.663 --> 04:23.849
I found this on the kitchen floor.

04:23.874 --> 04:25.406
It's a positive pregnancy test.

04:25.431 --> 04:26.576
Oh, jeez.

04:26.578 --> 04:27.859
It's got to be Stella's, right?

04:27.884 --> 04:29.617
Well, it definitely can't Shea's.

04:29.619 --> 04:30.909
She's an innocent child.

04:30.911 --> 04:32.909
- She's 23.
- What?

04:32.911 --> 04:34.576
That can't be right.

04:35.689 --> 04:36.735
What about Martina?

04:36.760 --> 04:37.566
She's still young enough.

04:37.591 --> 04:39.271
It's not Martina's.
She would have told me.

04:39.619 --> 04:40.620
Hmm.

04:40.630 --> 04:42.670
Well, maybe she's just
waiting for the right time

04:42.672 --> 04:43.920
or, uh...

04:43.922 --> 04:45.170
or...

04:45.172 --> 04:46.312
Or what?

04:46.811 --> 04:48.422
It's not yours.

04:53.588 --> 04:55.982
Are you actually saying that to me?

04:56.007 --> 04:57.586
As your father, it's ridiculous.

04:57.588 --> 05:01.253
But as an ex-cop, I've got
to consider all possibilities.

05:01.255 --> 05:04.417
Her phone is right there.
Let's check it for suspects.

05:04.442 --> 05:06.192
I am not gonna do that.

05:06.217 --> 05:07.775
So you'll just raise
the kid as your own?

05:07.800 --> 05:09.498
Oh, stop that.

05:10.190 --> 05:11.607
Martina has nothing to hide.

05:11.680 --> 05:12.997
So it won't hurt to look at it.

05:13.022 --> 05:14.712
Fine. Just to shut you up.

05:17.089 --> 05:18.464
Oh, David Connor.

05:18.489 --> 05:19.938
Who's that? An old boyfriend?

05:20.052 --> 05:21.913
Oh, for God's sake!

05:23.675 --> 05:25.214
Yes.

05:27.694 --> 05:28.734
"The other night was great.

05:28.736 --> 05:30.676
Meet me at the hotel Friday at 9:00."

05:30.701 --> 05:31.785
Mm.

05:31.810 --> 05:35.727
In the cop business,
we call that a clue.

05:37.319 --> 05:38.146
What's going on?

05:38.160 --> 05:40.178
Okay, look, let me first
say that I love you.

05:40.203 --> 05:41.576
I trust you completely,

05:41.601 --> 05:43.756
but Dad and I went through your phone,

05:43.781 --> 05:46.825
and it appears that you've
been banging your ex-boyfriend

05:46.827 --> 05:49.106
and are pregnant with his baby, so...

05:50.267 --> 05:51.548
thoughts?

05:55.384 --> 05:56.992
What's wrong with you?

05:56.994 --> 05:59.714
David Connor texted you
about meeting at a hotel.

06:00.003 --> 06:03.688
Yes, because he wants me
to check out the the venue

06:03.713 --> 06:05.867
for his wedding to Marcus.

06:05.869 --> 06:06.901
He's gay now.

06:06.926 --> 06:08.333
We're going to his wedding next month.

06:08.358 --> 06:10.422
I told you all about this.

06:10.913 --> 06:13.472
Okay, wait. Were the Mets
on when you were talking?

06:13.497 --> 06:15.662
And did I nod and say, "Sounds good"?

06:15.955 --> 06:18.770
- Yes.
- Well, there you have it.

06:19.315 --> 06:22.013
Oh, crap. Do we really
have to go to a wedding?

06:22.038 --> 06:22.733
Forget the wedding.

06:22.758 --> 06:24.115
Why did you think I was pregnant?

06:24.140 --> 06:26.794
Oh, right. Damn it.
Somebody's still pregnant.

06:29.768 --> 06:30.854
Look what I found in our kitchen.

06:31.940 --> 06:33.771
- Our kitchen?
- Yeah, of course our kitchen.

06:33.773 --> 06:34.946
Why would I take a pregnancy test

06:34.971 --> 06:37.142
from someone else's kitchen?

06:37.940 --> 06:40.021
Okay, okay, let's not freak out

06:40.023 --> 06:42.726
and jump to the logical
and correct conclusion

06:42.751 --> 06:44.273
that Stella's pregnant.

06:44.711 --> 06:45.344
How do we do that?

06:45.369 --> 06:47.576
Hold on. I'll think of something.

06:47.872 --> 06:49.203
Got one.

06:49.205 --> 06:51.451
The plumber dropped her pregnancy test

06:51.476 --> 06:52.802
on the kitchen floor.

06:53.543 --> 06:56.208
When's the last time
you saw a female plumber?

06:56.210 --> 06:58.208
- A woman can plumb.
- This is not the time.

06:58.210 --> 06:59.517
You're right.

07:00.043 --> 07:02.395
Look, we need to confirm
things with Stella,

07:02.420 --> 07:04.270
and then we'll figure
out what to do from there.

07:04.976 --> 07:06.626
Is it too late for adoption?

07:06.645 --> 07:08.560
It hasn't even been born yet.

07:08.585 --> 07:10.304
I'm talking about Stella.

07:13.732 --> 07:14.732
Here you go, Dad.

07:15.043 --> 07:16.707
Oh, thanks, son.

07:17.565 --> 07:20.653
Large popcorn with butter...
just like our first date.

07:20.870 --> 07:23.243
No, you had Sour Patch Kids.

07:23.245 --> 07:24.549
Oh, yeah.

07:24.574 --> 07:27.184
I love those tart little bastards.

07:28.825 --> 07:31.032
Do you remember where we sat that night?

07:31.034 --> 07:32.365
Of course I do.

07:32.367 --> 07:34.698
Fifth row, center, best
seats in the house...

07:34.700 --> 07:36.251
my signature move.

07:36.439 --> 07:38.870
We sat in the front row
because you weren't ready

07:38.895 --> 07:40.351
when I picked you up.

07:40.492 --> 07:42.127
Ah, yes, fashionably late...

07:42.151 --> 07:44.027
my signature move.

07:44.943 --> 07:46.316
I remember it well.

07:46.318 --> 07:49.256
Oh, God, you're remembering
things after I tell you.

07:49.281 --> 07:52.110
It's not remembering. It's just hearing.

07:53.609 --> 07:55.862
Guys, who is "Bard Tipt"?

07:59.846 --> 08:03.816
Ethan, you'll never believe
what I overheard in the lobby.

08:03.818 --> 08:05.519
They're having a secret
advanced screening

08:05.544 --> 08:07.682
of "Prisoners of Galifron" here tonight.

08:07.745 --> 08:09.701
Are you kidding me? I love those books!

08:09.703 --> 08:10.629
Me too!

08:10.654 --> 08:12.256
Just think... on the
other side of that wall,

08:12.281 --> 08:14.743
the Galifronians will be
fighting for their freedom.

08:14.745 --> 08:17.076
And yet we sit idly by and do nothing,

08:17.078 --> 08:19.097
like the cowards of Fargul.

08:19.313 --> 08:20.743
We could ask if we could go.

08:20.745 --> 08:21.565
Or...

08:21.990 --> 08:23.738
we could sneak out and not tell anyone,

08:23.740 --> 08:25.443
like the rebels of Zukon.

08:25.661 --> 08:26.932
They died.

08:28.823 --> 08:30.571
Plus, I never could.

08:30.573 --> 08:31.785
I'm a rule-follower.

08:31.909 --> 08:33.725
Just yesterday I wanted
to sample a third flavor

08:33.750 --> 08:35.573
at the frozen-yogurt place, but...

08:35.576 --> 08:37.227
The limit is two.

08:37.994 --> 08:39.381
I know how you feel.

08:39.476 --> 08:41.599
But where has all this
rule-following gotten us?

08:41.601 --> 08:43.474
Living with our parents, out of work,

08:43.602 --> 08:44.726
spending a Friday night

08:44.751 --> 08:46.908
re-creating my parents' first date.

08:47.267 --> 08:48.064
What's even sadder is,

08:48.089 --> 08:50.128
it's the first date
I've been on in months.

08:50.517 --> 08:52.436
The last time I kissed
someone, the constellation Orion

08:52.461 --> 08:56.292
hadn't even risen in
the western sky yet.

08:56.479 --> 08:58.337
It was six months ago.

08:59.351 --> 09:00.640
Let's do it.

09:03.476 --> 09:04.660
It's sold out.

09:04.685 --> 09:07.174
The one time we break the
rules, we don't get to enjoy it.

09:07.176 --> 09:10.147
Unless we break more rules.

09:10.172 --> 09:11.739
More rules?

09:11.784 --> 09:13.862
We could sneak in and stand in the back.

09:13.887 --> 09:15.178
Stand in the back?

09:15.203 --> 09:16.717
That's violating the fire code.

09:16.742 --> 09:17.999
You need to keep the aisle clear.

09:18.024 --> 09:19.421
Everyone knows that.

09:20.797 --> 09:23.389
Now I'm getting a sweat
mustache just thinking about it.

09:25.076 --> 09:26.412
What are you two doing here?

09:26.437 --> 09:27.946
And where's your vest?

09:28.609 --> 09:29.362
Um...

09:29.387 --> 09:30.798
I don't know how to answer that.

09:30.823 --> 09:33.393
You're supposed to have your
vest on before your shift.

09:34.940 --> 09:38.162
Uh, sorry, boss. She
won't let it happen again.

09:39.955 --> 09:41.265
Here, put this on.

09:41.289 --> 09:43.029
"Prisoners of Galifron"
is about to start.

09:43.054 --> 09:45.458
Get inside and give
the pre-show speech.

09:49.039 --> 09:51.883
Oh, my God, now we're
impersonating employees too?

09:52.797 --> 09:54.420
Maybe for the first time in our lives,

09:54.422 --> 09:56.461
we should color outside the lines.

09:56.695 --> 09:58.795
I couldn't even sit next
to the kids who did that.

09:59.014 --> 10:00.642
If the bear and the bunny
and the birthday present

10:00.667 --> 10:01.516
are all the same color,

10:01.541 --> 10:03.641
that's not a tea party, that's chaos!

10:04.630 --> 10:07.378
Well, maybe you and I need
some chaos in our lives.

10:07.403 --> 10:10.837
And what are they gonna
do, send us to movie jail?

10:11.072 --> 10:13.111
But what if I get addicted to this?

10:13.113 --> 10:15.400
What if I need bigger and bigger highs?

10:15.425 --> 10:16.778
I've seen this in movies.

10:16.987 --> 10:18.687
It starts with one minor transgression,

10:18.712 --> 10:20.266
and before you know it,
you're working the streets

10:20.291 --> 10:21.683
to pay for your habit.

10:22.716 --> 10:26.214
And then one day, along
comes a handsome banker,

10:26.216 --> 10:27.971
and he rents you out for the night.

10:29.916 --> 10:31.498
The next thing you know,
you're at the opera,

10:31.500 --> 10:34.166
and everyone thinks you're a real lady.

10:36.289 --> 10:37.296
Let's do it.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.631
She's crying.

10:46.043 --> 10:48.413
It's the pregnancy hormones.

10:49.750 --> 10:51.811
I was wrong about this movie.

10:52.017 --> 10:53.404
It's so romantic.

10:53.816 --> 10:56.055
He would take a bullet for her.

10:56.080 --> 10:59.589
The most a guy has ever
taken for me is a drug test.

11:00.825 --> 11:03.669
And he failed.

11:04.915 --> 11:07.773
Your grandfather would take
a bullet for me any day.

11:07.798 --> 11:09.028
I would?

11:12.898 --> 11:14.218
You bet I would!

11:14.916 --> 11:16.734
But why would anyone want to shoot you?

11:16.759 --> 11:19.375
You're perfect in every way.

11:20.767 --> 11:24.601
Oh, guys, even though you're
old, you still have feelings.

11:28.108 --> 11:29.856
Ooh, now she's texting someone.

11:30.900 --> 11:31.900
Oh!

11:32.207 --> 11:33.604
She's texting me.

11:35.300 --> 11:36.804
She needs a tampon.

11:36.829 --> 11:39.233
Ugh, gross.

11:39.866 --> 11:40.904
No, not gross.

11:40.929 --> 11:42.872
That means she's not pregnant!

11:44.029 --> 11:45.122
But wait.

11:45.866 --> 11:47.346
That means it's Shea.

11:48.600 --> 11:49.764
Shea's pregnant.

11:49.766 --> 11:52.532
Oh, no, not the good one.

11:59.109 --> 12:01.355
Shea can't have a baby. Shea is a baby.

12:01.409 --> 12:04.161
Well, clearly she's more
grown up than we thought.

12:04.186 --> 12:05.444
Where is she?

12:05.878 --> 12:07.376
I don't know.

12:07.378 --> 12:08.772
I'll text her.

12:09.422 --> 12:11.337
So please turn off your cell phones.

12:12.506 --> 12:14.179
See? Someone's texting me,

12:14.204 --> 12:15.313
but they're just gonna have to wait,

12:15.338 --> 12:16.920
because I'm turning off my cell phone.

12:18.589 --> 12:20.393
Seriously, guys, listen up.

12:20.418 --> 12:23.438
We are real ushers talking to you.

12:25.676 --> 12:27.339
Let me switch to Galifronian.

12:27.764 --> 12:28.566
_

12:33.236 --> 12:34.667
_

12:36.124 --> 12:37.032
_

12:37.792 --> 12:39.901
_

12:43.639 --> 12:46.161
Why won't Shea text back?

12:46.186 --> 12:47.387
Let's go look for her.

12:47.389 --> 12:49.054
I don't like this movie, anyway.

12:49.769 --> 12:52.892
I like movies where they don't
end up together in the end.

12:52.894 --> 12:54.367
Nice spoiler, dude.

12:54.392 --> 12:56.184
This movie's 20 years old.

12:56.186 --> 12:57.761
That's on you.

13:00.676 --> 13:01.934
Oh, my God.

13:01.936 --> 13:03.633
I just had an epitome.

13:04.292 --> 13:06.362
Did you guys realize that
you're a white cop guy

13:06.387 --> 13:07.336
like Kevin Costner

13:07.361 --> 13:10.151
and you're a black lady
like Whitney Houston?

13:10.561 --> 13:13.934
It's like they made this movie
so you guys would fall in love.

13:13.936 --> 13:15.580
Well, it sure worked.

13:16.232 --> 13:18.777
And it's bringing back so many memories.

13:20.614 --> 13:23.720
I don't know why I'm
getting so emotional.

13:28.552 --> 13:30.341
I just had a terrible thought.

13:30.343 --> 13:31.436
Not now. We're looking for Shea.

13:31.461 --> 13:33.625
What if that test belongs to Alice?

13:33.678 --> 13:34.982
Alice?

13:37.064 --> 13:38.738
Isn't she beyond that?

13:39.260 --> 13:41.994
The women in her family
stay fertile forever.

13:42.057 --> 13:45.449
Her sister retired and
had a baby that same year.

13:47.057 --> 13:48.763
Plus, she's acting moody,

13:48.765 --> 13:51.518
and her bust is very bounteous.

13:52.278 --> 13:55.237
Aren't those her usual characteristics?

13:55.239 --> 13:56.570
I'm gonna ask her.

13:56.572 --> 13:58.107
You do that.

13:58.894 --> 14:01.587
Have you lost your damn mind?

14:02.845 --> 14:04.558
It's not Alice.

14:05.136 --> 14:06.739
Good to know.

14:08.603 --> 14:12.021
You are now a prisoner of Galifron!

14:12.447 --> 14:13.686
This is amazing!

14:13.768 --> 14:14.837
Excuse me.

14:14.862 --> 14:15.947
Shh. It's cool.

14:15.972 --> 14:18.147
We're real ushers.

14:18.238 --> 14:21.110
No, we're real ushers.

14:21.135 --> 14:23.773
You're... not.

14:24.535 --> 14:26.710
You're going to movie jail.

14:28.997 --> 14:31.084
Well, we now know two things...

14:31.087 --> 14:34.338
one, we've been banned from the
movie theater for six months.

14:34.363 --> 14:37.945
Two, movie jail is just
the manager's office.

14:38.294 --> 14:39.917
No, not in there either.

14:39.919 --> 14:40.987
There she is.

14:41.012 --> 14:43.569
Oh, she's glowing. Look at her.

14:43.625 --> 14:46.400
How did we not notice the glow?

14:46.425 --> 14:49.135
Okay, let's try to keep it together.

14:49.993 --> 14:52.652
Oh, my God, my little baby's pregnant.

14:54.087 --> 14:55.665
Hey, Shea.

14:55.788 --> 14:59.019
Mom, Dad, I made a terrible mistake.

14:59.021 --> 14:59.892
You don't have to say it.

14:59.917 --> 15:02.228
We know, and we're here for you.

15:02.230 --> 15:03.394
Don't be mad at Shea.

15:03.396 --> 15:05.172
I talked her into it.

15:06.165 --> 15:08.394
- What?
- No, Ethan.

15:08.396 --> 15:10.688
I wanted to do it
just as much as he did.

15:13.396 --> 15:15.744
And I loved every second of it.

15:17.030 --> 15:18.761
But now I'm paying for it.

15:19.065 --> 15:20.790
Ethan, how the hell could you do this?

15:20.792 --> 15:22.706
Mike, it was only one time.

15:22.867 --> 15:26.141
And in six months, we can go
in and out as much as we please.

15:29.208 --> 15:30.388
Why would you say that to me?

15:30.413 --> 15:31.883
Are you insane?

15:32.610 --> 15:33.908
Look, Dad, it only happened

15:33.933 --> 15:35.942
because he was wearing that vest.

15:37.615 --> 15:41.241
Do you have some sort of vest fetish?

15:42.635 --> 15:44.141
What the hell is going on out here?

15:44.143 --> 15:45.398
You're missing the end of the movie.

15:45.423 --> 15:46.267
I'll tell you what's going on.

15:46.292 --> 15:48.172
Because of your stepson,
my daughter's pregnant.

15:48.289 --> 15:49.745
- What?
- No, I'm not.

15:49.748 --> 15:51.121
Not you. Shea.

15:51.340 --> 15:53.371
Finally, I'm the good one.

15:54.410 --> 15:55.453
I'm not pregnant.

15:55.455 --> 15:56.747
And it's gone.

15:57.689 --> 15:59.912
Mike, all Shea and I did
was sneak into a movie.

15:59.914 --> 16:02.037
Yeah, I understand my
reputation's tarnished,

16:02.039 --> 16:03.620
but why would you think I'm pregnant?

16:03.622 --> 16:05.656
Well, I found this
positive pregnancy test

16:05.681 --> 16:06.590
in the kitchen.

16:06.615 --> 16:07.585
Our kitchen?

16:07.663 --> 16:10.725
Why does everyone question
what kitchen I'm in?

16:10.975 --> 16:13.085
Dad, that's mine.

16:14.494 --> 16:16.389
Oh, you want more information?

16:17.575 --> 16:19.141
That would be helpful.

16:19.195 --> 16:21.734
I drew the plus sign on with a marker.

16:21.759 --> 16:23.782
It's my magic breakup stick.

16:24.254 --> 16:26.171
It makes guys disappear.

16:28.654 --> 16:31.485
I show it to them and say,
"Oops, you're a daddy."

16:31.487 --> 16:33.735
And then I tell them have to
get a better job and marry me,

16:33.737 --> 16:36.580
and then, poof, they're
pretty much gone.

16:37.821 --> 16:40.029
Now, I know what you're all thinking.

16:43.505 --> 16:46.628
Maybe you better tell
us what we're thinking.

16:46.630 --> 16:49.630
That I should bring this
genius idea to "Shark Tank"?

16:51.710 --> 16:53.896
That's really sweet, you guys.

16:53.921 --> 16:55.412
But I don't know.

16:55.437 --> 16:57.912
Tonight it's kind of bumming me out.

16:58.002 --> 16:59.208
Something about this movie

16:59.233 --> 17:01.725
and the whole "I Will
Always Love You" thing

17:01.750 --> 17:04.684
and Grandma and Grandpa's
beautiful marriage.

17:04.755 --> 17:07.127
And ours.

17:07.130 --> 17:10.752
Sure, but it's more moving
when it's interracial.

17:10.755 --> 17:13.295
You guys didn't have to
fight society for your love.

17:13.297 --> 17:15.865
They fought nothing. It was the '90s.

17:17.696 --> 17:18.718
Shut up, Mike.

17:18.742 --> 17:20.866
We're heroes, and you know it.

17:20.925 --> 17:21.895
Calm down, honey.

17:21.920 --> 17:23.751
Let's just go back and
watch the rest of the movie.

17:23.839 --> 17:25.255
Good idea.

17:25.257 --> 17:27.088
You know, I thought it
might be nice to share it

17:27.089 --> 17:29.376
with the family, but Mike was right.

17:29.712 --> 17:30.965
It is kind of weird.

17:33.906 --> 17:36.051
Look, Stella, I don't want
to give you some big lecture.

17:36.076 --> 17:38.201
- Thanks, Dad.
- Get back here.

17:39.132 --> 17:40.699
Have a seat.

17:42.532 --> 17:44.703
The first time I saw one
of those pregnancy tests,

17:44.728 --> 17:46.235
your mother was pregnant with you.

17:46.265 --> 17:48.930
Oh, the timing could
not have been worse.

17:48.932 --> 17:50.582
But I couldn't have been happier.

17:51.099 --> 17:53.332
I was so excited to meet you...

17:54.272 --> 17:57.330
this little baby that was
gonna change our whole lives.

17:57.332 --> 17:59.330
Aw, Dad.

17:59.332 --> 18:01.852
Hey. You are a beautiful young woman

18:01.877 --> 18:03.997
who can get any guy you want,

18:03.999 --> 18:05.997
but you deserve a guy
who sees that stick

18:05.999 --> 18:09.060
and runs towards you, not away from you.

18:09.246 --> 18:12.619
That would be nice. I would like that...

18:12.756 --> 18:14.053
someday.

18:14.082 --> 18:16.747
But maybe a nice guy like
Aaron gets a second date.

18:16.749 --> 18:18.247
That sounds good.

18:18.249 --> 18:21.311
Maybe even invite him
over for a family dinner.

18:21.357 --> 18:23.688
I'll do that. I'll
go call him right now.

18:23.690 --> 18:25.147
He's in between sets.

18:25.149 --> 18:26.480
What is he, in a band?

18:26.630 --> 18:29.124
No. He's a go-go boy.

18:31.083 --> 18:34.343
But don't worry. He's only gay for pay.

18:36.594 --> 18:38.671
He'll tell you all about it at dinner.

18:43.328 --> 18:46.411
Only gay for pay.

18:48.180 --> 18:50.025
At least he has a job.

18:52.321 --> 18:54.134
Yeah, let's hang on to that.

18:56.750 --> 19:01.319
♪ And I ♪

19:01.344 --> 19:06.101
♪ Will always love you ♪

19:06.927 --> 19:10.022
So here we are, all
alone in the theater,

19:10.047 --> 19:12.300
holding hands, just like our first date.

19:12.302 --> 19:13.355
Yeah.

19:13.699 --> 19:16.004
I remember you smiled
like that that night,

19:16.029 --> 19:17.592
and I thought to myself,

19:17.594 --> 19:21.014
"Bob, don't screw this
up. This is the one."

19:21.302 --> 19:22.850
I felt the same way.

19:23.596 --> 19:26.173
I'll never forget how
beautiful you were that night.

19:27.119 --> 19:28.658
You remember the important stuff.

19:28.660 --> 19:30.859
I'll give you that.

19:32.288 --> 19:35.593
I also remember when all
the credits were done,

19:35.900 --> 19:38.518
I picked you up like
Kevin picked up Whitney

19:38.543 --> 19:41.367
and carried you right
out of the theater.

19:41.661 --> 19:43.654
Those days are gone.

19:45.349 --> 19:47.660
The hell they are.

19:49.634 --> 19:50.869
Jump in, baby.

19:53.865 --> 19:56.658
I'm fine. I'm fine. I
just pulled a muscle.

19:56.740 --> 19:58.408
You're a dummy.

19:58.662 --> 20:01.700
A very, very romantic dummy.

20:01.702 --> 20:03.075
Mwah.

20:03.162 --> 20:05.702
Remind me to throw my
back out more often.

20:08.105 --> 20:09.925
Watch the corner.

20:14.195 --> 20:15.533
You know, for a half second there,

20:15.535 --> 20:17.636
when I thought you were pregnant,

20:18.682 --> 20:20.404
a little part of me was excited.

20:21.202 --> 20:22.115
Really?

20:22.668 --> 20:24.838
Well, you know, babies are so cute...

20:25.696 --> 20:27.594
the way they smell and look at you...

20:28.696 --> 20:32.166
that drunk smile they get
after they finish their bottle.

20:32.910 --> 20:34.783
They see everything for the first time,

20:34.785 --> 20:36.740
and somehow...

20:37.357 --> 20:39.959
it all feels new again.

20:41.312 --> 20:42.585
We're still young.

20:43.796 --> 20:45.155
Why don't we have another one?

20:46.244 --> 20:47.619
I'm gonna go see Aaron.

20:47.644 --> 20:49.577
Can I have some money for condoms?

20:51.054 --> 20:52.573
Oh, yeah, that's why.
