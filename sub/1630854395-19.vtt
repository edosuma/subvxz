that involved
me selling my plasma

20:07.207 --> 20:09.042
to several different
local area hospitals

20:09.042 --> 20:12.045
in an effort
to pay off the card.

20:13.254 --> 20:15.173
Speaking of which, I--I--I
probably should sit down

20:15.173 --> 20:17.884
for the rest of the day.
[chuckles]

20:17.884 --> 20:20.679
- [sighs]
- Thank you, Tío Oscar.

20:20.679 --> 20:22.347
There. Of course.
We're friends.

20:22.347 --> 20:24.224
We're not just friends.

20:24.224 --> 20:26.851
- We're family.
- [mimics explosion]

20:26.851 --> 20:28.895
Chance is right.

20:28.895 --> 20:29.979
There haven't been
tons of benefits

20:29.979 --> 20:32.482
having George back in our life,

20:32.482 --> 20:33.817
but one of them is you.

20:33.817 --> 20:35.777
You always look out
for the family.

20:35.777 --> 20:38.655
We were thinking that
Chance needs a godfather.

20:38.655 --> 20:41.950
And now we know
who it should be.

20:41.950 --> 20:44.035
I would be honored.

20:44.035 --> 20:47.664
Unless you mean someone else,
in which case, awkward.

20:47.664 --> 20:49.624
[chuckles]

20:50.834 --> 20:52.919
We mean you.

20:52.919 --> 20:54.421
So if something happens
to you guys,

20:54.421 --> 20:55.463
I--I take care of Chance?

20:55.463 --> 20:56.673
- No.
- [chuckles]

20:56.673 --> 20:59.092
No. No,
he goes to Rosie first,

20:59.092 --> 21:01.261
and then my parents,
then Tía Daisy.

21:01.261 --> 21:03.096
Basically,
you're 15th on the list

21:03.096 --> 21:07.225
right after Churro,
but ahead of my dad.

21:07.225 --> 21:09.269
So what do you wanna do, godson?

21:09.269 --> 21:13.189
I don't know, godfather,
maybe watch another movie?

21:13.189 --> 21:16.693
One neither of us have seen,
but kid-friendly.

21:16.693 --> 21:18.278
Hmm.

21:18.278 --> 21:21.614
This one has a picture
of a kid watching TV on it.

21:21.614 --> 21:22.907
Let me see that.

21:22.907 --> 21:26.703
"Poltergeist."
Sounds fun.

21:26.703 --> 21:29.247
