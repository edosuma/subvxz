00:01.436 --> 00:04.526
Previously on
Bob Hearts Abishola...

00:04.569 --> 00:06.571
Why have you come here today?

00:06.615 --> 00:09.270
Uh, to marry
the beautiful Abishola.

00:09.313 --> 00:12.969
Sometimes we do not know
what we need in our lives

00:13.013 --> 00:14.623
until it's there.

00:14.666 --> 00:17.452
I did not know
I needed laughter.

00:17.495 --> 00:21.804
I did not know
I needed your kindness and love.

00:21.847 --> 00:27.288
I promise to pray for you
and love you always.

00:27.331 --> 00:29.333
Thank you.

00:29.377 --> 00:32.119
Kind of sounded like vows.

00:32.162 --> 00:34.817
Yes, Husband.
Now where are mine?

00:34.860 --> 00:38.038
Husband? Boy, I like
the sound of that.

00:42.564 --> 00:45.132
Oh, breakfast in bed.

00:45.175 --> 00:48.004
Very romantic.It is. Just the two of us.

00:48.048 --> 00:49.701
DOTTIE:
Bobby? Hello?

00:49.745 --> 00:52.835
I'm kind of busy, Ma.Got it.

00:52.878 --> 00:55.142
Go back to your
lovemaking.

00:55.185 --> 00:56.491
We're not lovemaking.

00:56.534 --> 00:58.493
Yeah, we are. Go away!

00:58.536 --> 01:00.147
Bob made me breakfast.

01:00.190 --> 01:02.149
Aw, that's sweet.

01:02.192 --> 01:04.194
The door is locked.

01:04.238 --> 01:06.109
Yup.

01:06.153 --> 01:07.632
What about my breakfast?

01:07.676 --> 01:09.678
There's a big tub of
yogurt in the fridge.

01:09.721 --> 01:11.245
I smell pancakes!

01:11.288 --> 01:13.029
No, you don't!There's plenty here.

01:13.073 --> 01:15.031
She can have some of mine.No.

01:15.075 --> 01:18.208
I got up a half hour early to
make my wife a nice breakfast,

01:18.252 --> 01:21.559
and she's gonna eat it, and
you're gonna leave me alone!

01:24.171 --> 01:25.476
[sighs]

01:25.520 --> 01:26.956
Mom?

01:28.349 --> 01:29.437
Yeah?

01:29.480 --> 01:32.179
Give me one pancake.

01:32.222 --> 01:33.702
I'll slip it under the door.

01:33.745 --> 01:35.834
What am I--
a stray dog?

01:35.878 --> 01:37.793
Do you want it or not?

01:38.794 --> 01:40.535
Yeah.

01:42.711 --> 01:46.497
["Ifanla" by Sola Akingbola
playing]

02:08.171 --> 02:09.651
Chukwuemeka is pouting

02:09.694 --> 02:11.435
because there are certain things
I will not do with him.

02:11.479 --> 02:12.958
You do everything with him.

02:13.002 --> 02:15.004
And then tell
us about it.

02:15.047 --> 02:17.180
Well, even I have boundaries.

02:17.224 --> 02:20.488
I draw the line
at swimming lessons.

02:20.531 --> 02:23.186
That's where you draw the line?
Swimming?

02:23.230 --> 02:24.753
I don't like
what it does to my hair.

02:24.796 --> 02:28.322
I come out of the pool
looking like Frederick Douglass.

02:28.365 --> 02:29.888
That's not even your hair.

02:29.932 --> 02:32.108
You can just take it off
and hang it up like a towel.

02:32.152 --> 02:34.023
Never.

02:34.066 --> 02:36.286
I will be buried
in this wig.

02:36.330 --> 02:37.809
Anyway,

02:37.853 --> 02:41.161
if Chukwuemeka wants to get wet,
we can use Bob's hot tub.

02:41.204 --> 02:43.075
You have to share
with his mother.

02:43.119 --> 02:45.252
Every time we so much
as dip a toe in it,

02:45.295 --> 02:48.255
she wheels out in a swimsuit
and scares Bob away.

02:48.298 --> 02:50.300
GLORIA:
Ugh.

02:50.344 --> 02:52.433
Nothing like seeing
an old lady in a hot tub.

02:52.476 --> 02:54.217
That's the reason
I stopped going to the Y.

02:54.261 --> 02:57.655
Gloria, you are one
of those old ladies.

02:57.699 --> 03:00.223
At least I can swim, baldy.

03:02.138 --> 03:05.228
Abishola, I know how hard
it is taking care of a parent.

03:05.272 --> 03:08.579
Mm. My grandmother used
to live with us, growing up.

03:08.623 --> 03:11.365
She used to pinch us
for no reason.

03:11.408 --> 03:14.933
Sometimes when I catch my hand
in a drawer, I think about her.

03:14.977 --> 03:17.719
Oh. So sweet.

03:17.762 --> 03:20.504
[scoffs]That's one thing
Americans do right.

03:20.548 --> 03:22.332
You treat your
kids bad enough,

03:22.376 --> 03:24.247
they just send
you to a home.Hmm.

03:24.291 --> 03:28.817
My mother-in-law walked that
line like a Flying Wallenda.

03:28.860 --> 03:30.166
I like the Nigerian way.

03:30.210 --> 03:31.254
I can treat my children

03:31.298 --> 03:32.386
like doo-doo,

03:32.429 --> 03:34.039
but if they treat me poorly,

03:34.083 --> 03:36.738
I will come back after death
and have my revenge.Oh.

03:36.781 --> 03:39.044
That's what kept us
in line for so long--

03:39.088 --> 03:40.829
fear of a pinching ghost.Mm.

03:51.318 --> 03:53.494
[indistinct chatter]

04:01.241 --> 04:02.938
What are you doing?

04:02.981 --> 04:05.549
My shirt keeps riding up.

04:05.593 --> 04:07.464
Maybe you should wear a shirt
that fits.

04:07.508 --> 04:09.988
The shirt did fit
until your wife washed it.

04:10.032 --> 04:13.122
So you blame my wife
for your peek-a-boo tummy?

04:13.165 --> 04:16.299
I have told her, this shirt
needs to be washed in cold

04:16.343 --> 04:17.996
and tumble dried on low.

04:18.040 --> 04:19.694
For a man with so many demands,

04:19.737 --> 04:21.348
perhaps you should
do your own laundry.

04:21.391 --> 04:22.697
Then how would she
get better at it?

04:22.740 --> 04:24.786
I will leave her a note.

04:24.829 --> 04:26.222
No. No more notes.

04:26.266 --> 04:27.963
You are right.

04:28.006 --> 04:29.791
This is a bigger problem.

04:29.834 --> 04:31.227
We should have
a family meeting.

04:31.271 --> 04:32.750
No! No family meetings.

04:32.794 --> 04:35.318
We banned family meetings
at the last family meeting!

04:35.362 --> 04:36.841
Fine.

04:36.885 --> 04:39.670
Then peek-a-boo.
I see you!

04:40.671 --> 04:42.586
Oh.

04:44.414 --> 04:46.764
He still living
above your garage?Yes.

04:46.808 --> 04:48.766
I have thought about
setting fire to it,

04:48.810 --> 04:51.160
but then he would just
move into the house.

04:51.203 --> 04:53.162
Yeah, fire's not an option
for me, either.

04:53.205 --> 04:55.599
The house has
a sprinkler system.

04:55.643 --> 04:59.560
We'd all survive.Oh.

04:59.603 --> 05:02.258
Thanks for coming
to lunch with me.

05:02.302 --> 05:04.304
[laughs]No problem.

05:04.347 --> 05:06.001
You begged, and I was hungry.

05:06.044 --> 05:09.309
Well, hungry or not,

05:09.352 --> 05:12.007
I enjoy our special
time together.

05:12.050 --> 05:14.183
Sure.

05:16.838 --> 05:20.363
Look, I'm sorry if I'm coming
across a little needy.

05:20.407 --> 05:23.453
You know, my therapist says
I'm in constant search

05:23.497 --> 05:25.716
to either get love
or give love, you know?

05:25.760 --> 05:27.849
I'm a love junkie. [laughs]

05:27.892 --> 05:29.720
Is that all you're on?

05:31.200 --> 05:33.855
You know, I used to resent the
fact that you moved in with Bob.

05:33.898 --> 05:35.857
It's 'cause he's the oldest.

05:35.900 --> 05:39.382
Plus, he has the wine fridge.

05:39.426 --> 05:41.515
No. I mean, I-I
totally get it now.

05:41.558 --> 05:43.821
I mean, imagine if you would
have moved into the room

05:43.865 --> 05:45.693
I made up for you
after your stroke.

05:45.736 --> 05:47.869
You had a room for me?I did.

05:47.912 --> 05:49.261
I had no idea.

05:49.305 --> 05:52.047
But the universe has a way
of working things out.

05:52.090 --> 05:53.831
You know, I couldn't
handle you the way Bob does.

05:53.875 --> 05:56.878
God, he gets you full
blast, 24 hours a day.

05:56.921 --> 05:59.097
Dottie at home,
Dottie at work,

06:04.494 --> 06:07.628
[sighs]I get it. You dodged a bullet.

06:07.671 --> 06:09.412
Not really a bullet.

06:09.456 --> 06:11.980
More like one of those little
shivs they make in prisons.

06:14.286 --> 06:15.940

Ah...

06:20.554 --> 06:23.426
Kofo, what do you mean,
you're moving out?

06:23.470 --> 06:26.473
I see you have received my note.

06:26.516 --> 06:27.996
Is this because of the laundry?

06:28.039 --> 06:30.651
I will tell my wife
to put it on warm.

06:30.694 --> 06:33.958
Not on warm! It
peek-a-boos on warm!

06:34.002 --> 06:36.091
This is why I must go.

06:36.134 --> 06:37.745
No one hears me,

06:37.788 --> 06:39.921
but I hear you
and your wife.

06:39.964 --> 06:41.705
Making love?

06:41.749 --> 06:44.099
No! Talking about me.

06:44.142 --> 06:46.623
"He was only supposed
to be here two months."

06:46.667 --> 06:48.799
"A grown man shouldn't
have so many puzzles."

06:48.843 --> 06:50.627
"He cries more
than our son."

06:50.671 --> 06:52.586
Not more. Just louder.

06:52.629 --> 06:54.979
And longer.

06:55.023 --> 06:57.852
Then I will make sure my new
apartment allows crying.

06:57.895 --> 06:59.854
And will not
count my puzzles.

06:59.897 --> 07:03.988
Kofo, sometimes we complain,

07:04.032 --> 07:05.903
but that does not mean
we want you to leave.

07:05.947 --> 07:08.471
I heard your wife say,
"Make him leave."

07:10.430 --> 07:11.779
We are family.

07:11.822 --> 07:13.955
I will never turn
my back on you.

07:13.998 --> 07:16.261
Never?Never.

07:16.305 --> 07:19.569
It's just sometimes
I feel more like

07:19.613 --> 07:22.529
an unwanted guest than a
cherished member of your family.

07:22.572 --> 07:24.879
We will try and do better.

07:24.922 --> 07:26.924
Thank you, Cousin.Mm-hmm.

07:26.968 --> 07:29.492
I actually have some suggestions
of how you can do better.

07:34.802 --> 07:36.760
A walk-in bathtub?

07:36.804 --> 07:38.196
It is not just for me.

07:38.240 --> 07:40.677
It is for all of us
for when we grow old together.

07:46.770 --> 07:49.904
Where you been?

07:49.947 --> 07:51.514
At the hospital.

07:51.558 --> 07:54.996
But you're usually back
by 5:45. It's 6:15.

07:55.039 --> 07:56.214
There was traffic.

07:56.258 --> 07:57.868
Well, not according
to the bus tracker,

07:57.912 --> 07:59.957
but no one's calling you a liar.

08:00.001 --> 08:02.873
It would be nice to put
my things down, huh?Of course.

08:02.917 --> 08:04.962
I know I can be a lot sometimes.

08:05.006 --> 08:07.748
You are fine.Bobby complains
about me all the time,

08:07.791 --> 08:10.838
so I don't know what's truth,
or what's just him

08:10.881 --> 08:13.841
being that chubby little
boy who cried wolf.

08:13.884 --> 08:15.712
Do you have that story
in your country?

08:15.756 --> 08:19.542
But with a different animal,
like a lion or a zebra?

08:19.586 --> 08:22.371
"The Boy Who Cried Zebra."”

08:22.414 --> 08:24.895
It doesn't have
the same ring.

08:24.939 --> 08:27.419
The story is the same.Oh, so you know what I'm saying?

08:27.463 --> 08:30.597
I do.And you'll be able to tell
me if I'm being a lot?

08:30.640 --> 08:32.555
You are being a lot.

08:32.599 --> 08:33.556
When?

08:33.600 --> 08:35.036
Right now.

08:35.079 --> 08:36.559
And first thing in the morning.

08:36.603 --> 08:38.779
And late at night.

08:38.822 --> 08:41.303
I see.Now you can

08:41.346 --> 08:43.087
improve on your behavior, huh?

08:43.131 --> 08:45.481
I'll do that.

08:45.525 --> 08:46.787
Good.

08:46.830 --> 08:48.789
I'm glad we could have this talk

08:48.832 --> 08:50.834
before Bob would want
to put you in a home.

08:52.401 --> 08:54.925
Yeah.

08:54.969 --> 08:57.537
I'm glad, too.

09:06.154 --> 09:09.897
Mm. I cannot remember
the last time we had a date.

09:09.940 --> 09:12.160
Three weeks and
four days ago.

09:12.203 --> 09:14.554
That was our wedding.Exactly.

09:16.251 --> 09:17.774
I texted your mother to see

09:17.818 --> 09:19.471
if I should
bring her back some food.

09:19.515 --> 09:21.386
Let me guess-- no answer.

09:21.430 --> 09:24.999
Oh, so she's giving me
the silent treatment?Oh, no.

09:25.042 --> 09:28.045
This isn't silent.
This is time release.

09:28.089 --> 09:30.613
She'll bring up this slight
at Christmas,

09:30.657 --> 09:32.746
at her birthday,
your birthday,

09:32.789 --> 09:34.617
and just when you think
she's forgotten,

09:34.661 --> 09:38.708
it'll flare up again,
like a cold sore.

09:38.752 --> 09:40.623
She asked me to be honest.

09:40.667 --> 09:44.105
And you fell for it,
but we all do. Once.

09:44.148 --> 09:45.497
So that's it?

09:45.541 --> 09:47.238
There's nothing else I can do?

09:47.282 --> 09:48.936
Well, there is one thing.

09:48.979 --> 09:51.199
Since we know she
wants us to feel bad,

09:51.242 --> 09:54.028
we could stick it to her
by having a good time.

09:54.071 --> 09:57.118
That does not sound healthy.Ah, we're way past healthy.

09:57.161 --> 09:58.728
Welcome to the family.

09:58.772 --> 10:00.687

[shouting]:
Is that PAC-MAN?

10:13.830 --> 10:16.964
No, it's a game
where I plant corn.

10:17.007 --> 10:18.226
Sounds boring.

10:18.269 --> 10:21.142
It is, until the corn grows.
[laughs]

10:21.185 --> 10:23.231
Then you got to harvest it.

10:23.274 --> 10:25.668
Listen, I'm glad
you came over.

10:25.712 --> 10:28.279
It's nice to know one
of my children cares.

10:28.323 --> 10:31.805
My Wi-Fi was down,
so it's a win-win.

10:34.024 --> 10:35.809
So, how's life?

10:38.028 --> 10:39.116
Why?

10:39.160 --> 10:41.249
I'm curious.

10:42.250 --> 10:43.381
Why?

10:44.382 --> 10:46.341
Can't a mother just
talk to her son?

10:47.734 --> 10:49.344
But why?

10:49.387 --> 10:51.868
Oh, go back
to your corn.

10:51.912 --> 10:54.654
I got to feed
the pigs first.

10:56.612 --> 10:59.571
This is ridiculous.

11:24.248 --> 11:26.250
[whirring]

11:51.711 --> 11:53.277
It's your turn.

11:53.321 --> 11:54.539
I know.

11:54.583 --> 11:56.716
Why are you thinking so much?

11:56.759 --> 11:58.282
You are going to lose.

11:58.326 --> 12:01.764
Said the snake
to the weasel.

12:01.808 --> 12:03.897
[groans softly]

12:06.987 --> 12:11.774
That is ayo! I win.

12:11.818 --> 12:13.515
You sneaky little devil.

12:13.558 --> 12:15.517
And you are also...

12:15.560 --> 12:17.562
a little devil.

12:19.086 --> 12:20.522
Oh, really?

12:20.565 --> 12:22.306
[doorbell rings]

12:22.350 --> 12:23.873
Hold that thought.

12:23.917 --> 12:26.528
I will hold
whatever you would like.

12:27.485 --> 12:28.922
[doorbell rings]

12:28.965 --> 12:30.532
DOTTIE:
Tunde, open the door!

12:30.575 --> 12:32.273
Dottie?

12:33.840 --> 12:35.798
Buenas noches!

12:35.842 --> 12:38.758
Who wants a margarita?

12:42.239 --> 12:45.590
[piano music plays quietly]Mmm. This is very nice.

12:45.634 --> 12:47.288
You know, from this vintage,

12:47.331 --> 12:50.117
I would have thought this would
have been too fruit-forward.

12:50.160 --> 12:52.684
I love
that you were a sommelier.

12:52.728 --> 12:54.512
Keep going.

12:55.513 --> 12:58.125
This is a light,

12:58.168 --> 13:02.085
beautifully-balanced Beaujolais.

13:02.129 --> 13:04.958
All that class,
and you married me.

13:05.001 --> 13:07.612
I don't know
what I was thinking.

13:07.656 --> 13:08.875
[laughs]

13:08.918 --> 13:10.137
Have you decided?

13:10.180 --> 13:11.486
Yes. I'll have
the lamb chop.

13:11.529 --> 13:13.488
Nice choice. Salmon for me,

13:13.531 --> 13:15.011
and instead of potatoes, could
I get the vegetable medley?

13:15.055 --> 13:16.317
Of course.

13:16.360 --> 13:18.972
We are not going
to switch meals halfway through,

13:19.015 --> 13:20.887
if that is your plan.

13:20.930 --> 13:23.063
I'm just trying
to eat healthier.

13:23.106 --> 13:26.631
Mr. Wheeler,
are you trying to seduce me?

13:26.675 --> 13:28.372
[chuckles]
No.

13:28.416 --> 13:30.287
I mean, if it's working, yes.

13:30.331 --> 13:31.985
[laughs]But, uh,

13:32.028 --> 13:33.813
it's time to make some changes.

13:33.856 --> 13:36.903
Hmm. When did you decide this?

13:36.946 --> 13:38.774
When I saw you
walking down the aisle.

13:38.818 --> 13:40.428
Oh.Before you,
I didn't...

13:40.471 --> 13:43.518
I didn't think too far ahead.

13:43.561 --> 13:45.259
What did you think about?

13:45.302 --> 13:46.695
Mostly my next meal.

13:46.738 --> 13:48.305
Sometimes the only thing
that got me through the day

13:48.349 --> 13:50.568
was picturing a rib eye
and a baked potato.

13:51.569 --> 13:53.615
That is very sad.

13:53.658 --> 13:55.835
Well, back then, I didn't have
a lot to look forward to.

13:55.878 --> 13:57.837
Now I do.

13:57.880 --> 14:00.709
Are you saying
I'm your new rib eye?

14:00.752 --> 14:02.929
Ooh, let's not get carried away.

14:02.972 --> 14:04.626
You can be the baked potato.

14:04.669 --> 14:07.716
I am the rib eye.[laughs]

14:07.759 --> 14:09.805
Yes, you are.

14:09.849 --> 14:11.894
And you are extremely rare.

14:11.938 --> 14:13.243
Mm-hmm.

14:21.948 --> 14:23.906
Did I win?

14:23.950 --> 14:25.429
No.

14:25.473 --> 14:26.909
But I got more
rocks than you.

14:26.953 --> 14:30.086
Some of those are peanut M&Ms.

14:30.130 --> 14:32.959
Ah, you caught me.

14:33.002 --> 14:35.048
Look at that, Tunde.Mm.

14:35.091 --> 14:36.440
She cheats better
than you do.

14:37.441 --> 14:39.269
You know I cheat?[scoffs]

14:39.313 --> 14:40.967
Why didn't you
say anything?

14:41.010 --> 14:43.578
Because you are so cute
when you win.

14:43.621 --> 14:45.580
He does a little dance
in his seat.

14:45.623 --> 14:46.755
Do the dance.

14:46.798 --> 14:48.409
No.

14:48.452 --> 14:51.107
For me, Babatunde.

14:51.151 --> 14:53.501
Okay, for you.Mm.

14:54.502 --> 14:56.504
[laughs]

14:56.547 --> 14:58.506
Oh.[laughs]

14:58.549 --> 15:00.812
You two are
so adorable.

15:00.856 --> 15:01.813
Thank you.

15:01.857 --> 15:03.293
It reminds me

15:03.337 --> 15:05.556
I'm gonna die alone.

15:05.600 --> 15:09.734
Oh, Dottie,
you will not die alone.

15:09.778 --> 15:11.780
It's way too late
to find somebody.

15:11.823 --> 15:14.174
Yes, it is,
but now,

15:14.217 --> 15:16.350
you are part
of a Nigerian family.

15:16.393 --> 15:19.353
You will always
be taken care of.Really?

15:19.396 --> 15:21.659
I can be pretty annoying.

15:21.703 --> 15:22.878
Yes, you can.

15:22.922 --> 15:24.184
But you have

15:24.227 --> 15:26.621
earned the right
to be as annoying as you want.

15:26.664 --> 15:28.666
It is a perk of being old.

15:28.710 --> 15:31.104
You can yell at grocery clerks,

15:31.147 --> 15:35.369
or-or leave your turn signal on
and never turn.

15:36.500 --> 15:39.286
Do not worry, Dottie.

15:39.329 --> 15:40.940
You will always have
your family,

15:40.983 --> 15:43.420
and you will always have us.

15:43.464 --> 15:44.987
I will?

15:45.031 --> 15:46.467
Yes.

15:46.510 --> 15:50.427
And eventually, Olu and
I will also be invalids,

15:50.471 --> 15:53.822
and move into Bob's house
to die alongside you.

15:56.085 --> 15:57.957
I can't wait.

16:02.265 --> 16:04.354
Mom, we're home!

16:04.398 --> 16:06.661
And we brought you cheesecake.

16:06.704 --> 16:09.185
Want an untouched
vegetable medley?

16:09.229 --> 16:12.406
No, thanks.How'd it go?

16:12.449 --> 16:14.669
Great. Barely even saw her.

16:14.712 --> 16:17.150
She's not here.What?

16:17.193 --> 16:18.455
I cannot find
her anywhere.

16:18.499 --> 16:20.501
Where is she?

16:20.544 --> 16:22.851
Why are you asking me?

16:22.894 --> 16:25.332
Because you're the one who's
supposed to be watching her!

16:25.375 --> 16:27.638
I'm sorry. I had a bad harvest.

16:27.682 --> 16:29.292
She cannot be alone.

16:29.336 --> 16:30.815
She's still very fragile.

16:30.859 --> 16:32.034
There's no answer.

16:32.078 --> 16:34.036
I'll try, too.
You know what?

16:34.080 --> 16:36.038
We should go drive around.
She can't be far away.

16:36.082 --> 16:38.780
I'll stay here
in case she comes back.

16:40.738 --> 16:42.784
[sighs]

16:50.879 --> 16:52.924
Hmm.

16:58.234 --> 17:00.236
No. Ugh.

17:01.716 --> 17:04.197
[phone dings repeatedly]Will you look at that?

17:04.240 --> 17:06.242
My phone's blowing up.

17:06.286 --> 17:09.028
They must be sick
with worry.

17:09.071 --> 17:11.030
[dinging]Isn't it wonderful?

17:18.167 --> 17:20.213
[whirring]

17:39.884 --> 17:41.930
[groans]

17:52.636 --> 17:54.682
[exhales]

18:11.438 --> 18:13.483
Wait. You can walk?

18:13.527 --> 18:15.268
You didn't see anything.

18:15.311 --> 18:17.139
Yes, I did.

18:17.183 --> 18:19.141
You can walk.

18:19.185 --> 18:21.491
You tell anybody about this,
you're dead.What do you mean?

18:21.535 --> 18:23.798
This is great.Not...

18:23.841 --> 18:26.888
a... word!
