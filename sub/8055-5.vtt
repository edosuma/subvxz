WEBVTT

00:05.010 --> 00:07.945
I found this typewriter
next to the courtyard dumpster...

00:07.946 --> 00:11.615
An old Underwood Five
with original carriage return.

00:11.666 --> 00:13.183
Ah.

00:13.251 --> 00:15.786
I took her home, polished her up,

00:16.726 --> 00:20.729
and bought a brand-new ribbon
off of electronicbay.com.

00:20.796 --> 00:23.715
Okay, somebody's got
to do something.

00:23.783 --> 00:25.266
I'm getting a cluster headache.

00:25.334 --> 00:28.269
Oh, whoa, whoa, he's leaving.

00:28.337 --> 00:29.002
Let's go.

00:29.055 --> 00:31.474
I'm gonna throw it away.

00:31.525 --> 00:33.409
No, I'm not.
It weighs a billion tons.

00:33.477 --> 00:34.877
What is he typing anyway?

00:34.945 --> 00:37.813
"If you sons of bitches
try to remove this typewriter,

00:37.864 --> 00:40.816
I'll kill you."

00:40.884 --> 00:44.987
I'm gonna type every word I know.

00:45.038 --> 00:46.222
Rectangle!

00:46.289 --> 00:47.990
America!

00:48.041 --> 00:49.575
Megaphone!

00:49.659 --> 00:52.328
Monday!

00:52.379 --> 00:53.863
Butthole.

00:56.933 --> 01:06.873
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

01:14.017 --> 01:17.069
Well, I hate to be the bearer
of bad tidings,

01:17.154 --> 01:19.605
but these interviews are
more important than we thought.

01:19.689 --> 01:22.074
Harvest fest is two weeks away,

01:22.159 --> 01:24.326
and awareness is still
pretty low.

01:24.394 --> 01:25.728
Boy, 35%.

01:25.795 --> 01:27.496
It's actually 34.2%.

01:27.564 --> 01:28.781
34.2%.

01:28.865 --> 01:30.633
I am Ben, the numbers robot.

01:30.700 --> 01:32.284
It's just
an exact, uh, calculation.

01:32.369 --> 01:33.786
It is just an exact calculation.

01:33.870 --> 01:34.837
All right.

01:34.905 --> 01:36.739
So we're doing a huge media blitz

01:36.806 --> 01:38.591
to publicize
the Harvest Festival,

01:38.675 --> 01:41.544
and we've got TV,
newspaper, radio,

01:41.611 --> 01:44.680
and I even called Oprah.

01:44.748 --> 01:46.615
Well, I tried to call Oprah.

01:46.683 --> 01:48.083
I-I couldn't get her number.

01:48.134 --> 01:51.220
I'm putting it out there
like <i>the secret...</i>

01:51.288 --> 01:53.923
And hopefully she'll call me.

01:53.990 --> 01:56.058
Our first interview
is at 93.7 F.M.

01:56.126 --> 01:57.259
With Crazy Ira and the Douche.

01:57.327 --> 02:00.429
Crazy Ira and the Douche.

02:00.480 --> 02:03.315
They are Pawnee's most
hilarious drive-time radio guys.

02:03.400 --> 02:04.817
So much better than
Tubby Tony and the Papaya.

02:04.901 --> 02:05.951
Am I right?

02:06.036 --> 02:07.736
They're seriously so funny.

02:07.804 --> 02:09.270
Is this right?

02:09.322 --> 02:11.073
This feels almost perfect,

02:11.124 --> 02:15.244
but I don't think your core
has maximized elasticity.

02:15.295 --> 02:17.663
Okay, um, I'll come back
if you guys are being weird.

02:17.747 --> 02:19.114
No, no, no, no!

02:19.165 --> 02:20.666
You're exactly the person
that I most want to talk to

02:20.750 --> 02:21.967
right at this moment.

02:22.052 --> 02:23.785
- And Lunge.
- Oh.

02:23.837 --> 02:25.621
Have you given my offer
any more thought?

02:25.672 --> 02:28.557
What exactly would happen
if I said yes?

02:28.625 --> 02:30.626
Well, you would work
at the State House.

02:30.677 --> 02:31.961
You would coordinate

02:32.028 --> 02:33.295
my professional
and personal schedule,

02:33.363 --> 02:34.980
and we would give you
a small relocation fee

02:35.065 --> 02:36.148
for your move to Indianapolis.

02:36.233 --> 02:37.900
Oh, that sounds boring.

02:37.968 --> 02:40.736
But I have
nothing keeping me here.

02:40.804 --> 02:42.771
Do you have Internet
in your office?

02:42.822 --> 02:44.807
Yes.

02:44.874 --> 02:46.742
Fine. I'll do it.

02:46.809 --> 02:48.143
That is literally the best news

02:48.211 --> 02:49.745
that I've heard all day.

02:49.812 --> 02:52.648
Unlike April, I still do not know

02:52.716 --> 02:54.683
what my future holds with Chris,

02:54.751 --> 02:57.620
and it's starting to bum me out.

02:57.687 --> 02:59.988
I need some more vitamin "D."

03:00.040 --> 03:01.823
Yeah.

03:01.875 --> 03:05.377
Oh, hey, crazy.
What was that meeting about?

03:05.462 --> 03:07.630
Oh, it turns out
Chris is my real dad.

03:07.681 --> 03:08.864
I think you're lying.

03:08.932 --> 03:10.832
I think I know
what that meeting was about.

03:10.884 --> 03:12.768
You can't go to Indianapolis.

03:12.835 --> 03:14.737
There's got to be something
that I can do to convince you

03:14.804 --> 03:16.772
how much I care about you.

03:16.840 --> 03:19.241
Tell me
your least favorite things

03:19.309 --> 03:21.610
you have to do every day,
and I'll do them for a month.

03:21.678 --> 03:23.362
Fine.

03:23.446 --> 03:25.414
If you do everything I hate
for a month,

03:25.482 --> 03:28.117
then I might begin to think
about the possibility

03:28.184 --> 03:31.553
of thinking about maybe staying.

03:31.621 --> 03:34.623
That's all I have to hear.

03:34.691 --> 03:37.859
You won't live to regret this.

03:37.911 --> 03:40.462
Unless Andy can un-kiss Ann,

03:40.530 --> 03:43.365
then I'm not gonna change
my mind.

03:43.433 --> 03:45.134
But if he wants to take
my dumb sister

03:45.201 --> 03:46.468
to her dumb dance class,

03:46.536 --> 03:50.472
then I'm not gonna dumb stop him.

03:50.540 --> 03:53.475
Crazy Ira and the Douche...
93.7.

03:53.543 --> 03:56.111
You know why
I'd never be an astronaut?

03:56.179 --> 03:58.897
Two words... space farts.

03:58.982 --> 04:01.684
You can't roll down
the window of the shuttle.

04:01.751 --> 04:02.718
Am I right, folks?

04:02.769 --> 04:04.436
Houston, we have a...

04:04.521 --> 04:06.689
Now, what do you think
about that, Neil Armstrong?

04:06.740 --> 04:09.858
That's one small...
for man.

04:09.909 --> 04:13.262
One giant...
for mankind.

04:13.330 --> 04:15.230
All right, switching gears
here now.

04:15.298 --> 04:18.083
We got Leslie Knope
and Tom Haverfart...

04:18.168 --> 04:20.569
And, uh, Ben Wyatt,
and they're in the hizzy

04:20.620 --> 04:24.707
to talk about an upcoming event
called the Harvest Festival.

04:24.774 --> 04:26.759
Well, the Douche,
it's a Pawnee tradition,

04:26.843 --> 04:30.279
and it's where fun
meets awesome...

04:30.347 --> 04:31.964
Meets agriculture.

04:32.048 --> 04:34.767
And it is going to be
next month right here in Pawnee.

04:34.851 --> 04:35.951
And spoiler alert...

04:36.019 --> 04:38.287
It's gonna have
the best corn maze ever.

04:38.355 --> 04:40.723
You lost your virginity in
a corn maze, didn't you, Douche?

04:40.774 --> 04:42.157
Oh, that's right, to your mom.

04:43.860 --> 04:46.595
Crazy Ira, clean your room!

04:46.663 --> 04:48.947
There's also gonna be hayrides.

04:49.032 --> 04:51.433
"Hey, ride me"...is what
Crazy Ira's mom said.

04:51.484 --> 04:53.101
Stop it!

04:54.537 --> 04:56.955
China Joe, you are a poet.

04:58.708 --> 05:00.142
My bird is missing.

05:00.210 --> 05:01.810
I need a permit to post signs.

05:01.878 --> 05:04.496
Oh, let me just look
for that form.

05:04.581 --> 05:06.915
There's no time!
He can fly!

05:06.966 --> 05:09.184
Nine things April hates to do.

05:09.252 --> 05:11.503
"Number one, run
the permits desk for an hour."

05:11.588 --> 05:12.988
That's no problem.

05:13.056 --> 05:15.591
I eat running the permits desk
for an hour for breakfast.

05:15.658 --> 05:17.593
Ow, that's... ow.

05:17.660 --> 05:19.194
- Henry, stop it.
- Ow.

05:19.262 --> 05:22.097
Okay, Henry.
Cute kid.

05:22.148 --> 05:25.000
Andy, got a sec?

05:25.068 --> 05:27.969
- Yeah.
- Henry.

05:28.021 --> 05:30.105
Why are you working
the permits desk?

05:30.173 --> 05:33.992
And why was that child
clubbing your nuggets?

05:34.077 --> 05:37.179
I'm trying to stop April
from taking a job with Chris,

05:37.247 --> 05:40.616
so I'm doing everything she
hates doing for the next month.

05:40.683 --> 05:43.368
- That's going to work?
- She said it might.

05:43.453 --> 05:45.704
But it's all I got, man.

05:47.190 --> 05:49.007
Give me the list.

05:49.092 --> 05:50.459
I'll help you.

05:50.527 --> 05:53.495
Oh, my God.
Thank you.

05:55.865 --> 05:57.533
You got it.

05:57.600 --> 05:59.334
No, I don't care
about their relationship.

05:59.402 --> 06:01.904
I just don't want to lose April.

06:01.971 --> 06:06.108
I would never be able to find
a worse assistant.

06:06.176 --> 06:07.609
Okay, thanks, Leslie.

06:07.677 --> 06:10.245
But you know what
we really want to do today

06:10.313 --> 06:13.849
is have a chat
with Ben Wyatt here.

06:13.900 --> 06:15.250
- Come on, Ben.
- Come on, Ben!

06:15.318 --> 06:17.085
I'm more of a behind
the scenes kind of guy.

06:17.153 --> 06:20.255
Well, it's either come with us
or get in the spank chair.

06:20.323 --> 06:22.057
So maybe it's time
for an interview.

06:22.125 --> 06:23.826
Come on, everybody,
give him a hand.

06:23.877 --> 06:26.295
- Come on over, Ben.
- Oh, yeah.

06:26.362 --> 06:28.547
So this guy, Ben Wyatt,

06:28.631 --> 06:30.716
we're looking him up
on Altavista.

06:30.800 --> 06:35.571
He's from some hick town...
Partridge, Minnesota...

06:35.638 --> 06:40.142
and when he's 18,
he's elected mayor.

06:43.212 --> 06:44.880
♪
♪

06:48.217 --> 06:50.486
That's funny.
That's funny.

06:50.553 --> 06:52.588
He's 18, becomes the mayor,

06:52.655 --> 06:56.024
and then blows the whole budget
on an ice-skating rink.

06:56.075 --> 06:57.192
City goes bankrupt.

06:57.243 --> 06:59.828
You're out of there.

06:59.896 --> 07:01.396
What did you call it again, Ben?

07:01.447 --> 07:04.233
What was it called? Say it.

07:04.300 --> 07:05.834
Ice Town.

07:08.237 --> 07:09.738
I was just a...
I was a kid,

07:09.806 --> 07:13.342
and, um, when you... you...

07:13.409 --> 07:16.778
you end up getting out there
and, uh... and there's a...

07:16.846 --> 07:19.081
Oh, I really wish you guys
could see this guy right now.

07:19.148 --> 07:21.099
He is "draunched" is sweat.

07:21.184 --> 07:24.186
There's... there's also gonna be
ponies at the Harvest Festival.

07:24.253 --> 07:27.272
All right, let's take a caller
from Douche nation.

07:27.357 --> 07:29.191
- All right, talk to me, caller.
- What's up, guys?

07:29.258 --> 07:30.926
Just douchein' over here
in Eagleton.

07:30.977 --> 07:32.294
Sweet.

07:32.362 --> 07:34.763
Seems like 18
is pretty young for a mayor.

07:34.831 --> 07:37.766
What were you, like, 12?

07:37.817 --> 07:39.868
The funny, um...

07:39.936 --> 07:41.269
When...

07:41.321 --> 07:44.039
I guess...

07:44.107 --> 07:46.458
The fortunate, um...

07:46.543 --> 07:49.111
Can we just sort of...

07:50.997 --> 07:53.181
Game over, man.
Game over.

07:54.464 --> 07:55.387
Nice job, man.

07:55.507 --> 07:56.975
Was that your first time
talking to other people?

07:57.042 --> 07:58.142
'Cause it came off that way.

07:58.210 --> 07:59.577
You embarrassed me
in front of the Douche.

07:59.628 --> 08:01.346
I'm sorry, you guys.
I just... I haven't had to deal

08:01.413 --> 08:02.847
with that mayor stuff
for 17 years.

08:02.915 --> 08:04.182
I guess I'm not totally over it.

08:04.249 --> 08:06.367
No worries. Look, it was just
a bump in the road.

08:06.435 --> 08:07.819
Okay.

08:07.886 --> 08:09.754
Fortunately, the Leslie-mobile
is an all-terrain vehicle.

08:09.822 --> 08:12.023
So everything involving Ben
is fine.

08:12.090 --> 08:13.675
I just need to talk to you
in private

08:13.742 --> 08:16.861
about something different
that is not Ben related.

08:16.928 --> 08:19.113
Ben, good job.

08:19.198 --> 08:22.200
- Your boy's a nightmare.
- I know, but we need him.

08:22.267 --> 08:24.636
If they ask us about the budget,
he's our numbers guy.

08:24.703 --> 08:25.870
Well, we should just slap

08:25.937 --> 08:27.205
a pair of Ray-Bans
on a calculator,

08:27.272 --> 08:28.539
'cause that would be
way more charming.

08:28.607 --> 08:30.208
I'll do the newspaper interview.

08:30.276 --> 08:32.543
You and Ben do Channel 4.

08:32.611 --> 08:35.113
Perd Hapley is a big softy.
It'll be a puff piece.

08:35.179 --> 08:36.214
He can do it.

08:36.282 --> 08:38.282
So how are you liking Pawnee?

08:38.333 --> 08:40.518
Um, there are a lot of...
A lot of cars.

08:40.586 --> 08:42.886
I mean, not too many...

08:42.955 --> 08:44.722
Trucks and stuff.

08:44.790 --> 08:46.957
But, uh, yeah.

08:47.009 --> 08:48.826
Cool.

08:48.894 --> 08:51.012
- Good talk, Ice Town.
- Okay.

08:55.283 --> 08:58.002
Wow. Who knew that
watercress, garbanzo beans,

08:58.086 --> 08:59.787
and walnuts could complement
each other so well?

08:59.855 --> 09:01.822
Good dressing too, right?

09:01.890 --> 09:03.190
Flaxseed and agave...

09:03.258 --> 09:05.810
same basic ingredients
as bird feed.

09:07.562 --> 09:10.965
I'm just gonna come right out
and say it.

09:11.033 --> 09:12.833
I want to define your <i>bagua.</i>

09:12.901 --> 09:16.637
- Okay. What's that?
- It's a feng shui term.

09:16.705 --> 09:19.973
The energy in this house
is a little stale,

09:20.025 --> 09:22.493
but I think
I could redefine your flow

09:22.577 --> 09:25.212
in a very positive way.

09:25.280 --> 09:27.365
Great.
I'm not really attached

09:27.449 --> 09:29.166
to the way this stuff is arranged

09:29.251 --> 09:33.087
or the stuff itself
or this house even, really.

09:33.155 --> 09:34.338
Great.
Let's do it.

09:34.423 --> 09:37.008
Am I not being obvious enough?

09:37.092 --> 09:38.893
I feel like I'm being obvious.

09:38.960 --> 09:40.528
This just in.

09:40.595 --> 09:43.030
Harvest Festival?
More like Harvest "Bestival."

09:43.098 --> 09:44.932
The Parks Department
has planted the seeds,

09:45.000 --> 09:47.001
and now they're
harvesting the rewards.

09:47.069 --> 09:48.502
Great, you done?

09:48.553 --> 09:50.388
They'll put the "fun"
in funnel cake.

09:50.472 --> 09:51.505
Okay, now I'm done.

09:51.556 --> 09:53.674
- Tell me about Ben Wyatt.
- Sure.

09:53.742 --> 09:55.109
He works
for the state government,

09:55.177 --> 09:57.194
and he's been coming to advise
us about our budget.

09:57.279 --> 09:58.479
Oh, come on, Leslie.

09:58.547 --> 10:00.231
The Douche blew the story
wide open.

10:00.315 --> 10:02.383
Ben Wyatt bankrupts a town
and then comes to Pawnee

10:02.451 --> 10:03.884
to tell us
how to spend our money?

10:03.952 --> 10:05.286
There's no story here, Shauna.

10:05.354 --> 10:07.204
He's just
a dedicated civil servant

10:07.289 --> 10:09.073
who's doing whatever he can
to make sure

10:09.157 --> 10:12.543
that this is the best
Harvest Festival ever.

10:12.627 --> 10:16.030
And he's easy on the eyes too.

10:16.098 --> 10:18.566
Um, what exactly is the nature
of your relationship with him?

10:18.633 --> 10:20.468
Strictly professional,
just friends.

10:20.535 --> 10:21.902
So are you colleagues,
or are you friends?

10:21.970 --> 10:25.973
We are colleagues with benefits.

10:26.041 --> 10:29.076
We're colleagues
who benefit from the fact

10:29.144 --> 10:30.745
that we're also friends.

10:30.812 --> 10:33.564
I'm sorry, Shauna.
I think I need to go.

10:33.648 --> 10:35.249
But, um, thank you so much.

10:35.317 --> 10:36.934
And as always, everything
I said is off the record.

10:37.018 --> 10:38.052
Okay? Bye.

10:38.120 --> 10:40.604
What's the next task?

10:40.689 --> 10:42.323
Oh, we have to write her
grandmother a thank-you note

10:42.390 --> 10:43.941
for a birthday check.

10:44.025 --> 10:45.726
It has to be really good, too,
'cause it's five months late.

10:45.794 --> 10:47.328
Never written
a thank-you note before.

10:47.395 --> 10:48.496
This will be fun.

10:48.563 --> 10:50.331
What does she call her?

10:50.399 --> 10:52.399
Gamma.
No, Nannaw.

10:52.451 --> 10:54.301
Or Nanna...
Gizmo.

10:54.369 --> 10:56.137
Something like that.

10:59.124 --> 11:01.041
This is for your Gizmo.

11:01.093 --> 11:03.477
I think you'll find
it's pretty good.

11:03.545 --> 11:05.513
"Dear April's grandmother."

11:05.580 --> 11:07.181
I said grandfather.

11:07.248 --> 11:09.550
Oh. Oops.
Okay.

11:09.618 --> 11:11.585
"You are a beautiful
and amazing woman... " Man.

11:11.636 --> 11:13.821
"I hope someday I can become
half the woman you are."

11:13.889 --> 11:14.955
He's a man.

11:15.023 --> 11:16.090
"Thank you for the $500."

11:16.158 --> 11:17.258
It was $5.

11:17.325 --> 11:18.976
"Enjoy the mouse rat CD."

11:19.060 --> 11:21.979
He is deaf.

11:22.063 --> 11:25.533
Okay, do you want me to make
those changes, or is it good?

11:25.600 --> 11:27.067
Before we do this next interview,

11:27.119 --> 11:28.953
there's a little secret
I want to let you in on.

11:29.037 --> 11:31.271
It's called
the Haverford Schmooze.

11:31.323 --> 11:32.840
I was just caught off guard.
I'm fine.

11:32.908 --> 11:34.041
Three easy steps...

11:34.108 --> 11:35.743
Smile...

11:35.794 --> 11:39.246
Friendly physical contact,
and flattery.

11:39.297 --> 11:42.216
Hey, Perd, is your dad Robocop?
'Cause you're arms are guns.

11:42.283 --> 11:44.251
Robocop didn't have
guns for arms.

11:44.302 --> 11:46.387
Oh, my God. That's so
not the point, you nerd.

11:46.454 --> 11:48.839
I'm just saying.
Why are we going to a mall?

11:48.924 --> 11:50.508
I'm getting you a new suit.

11:50.592 --> 11:52.176
I've let this go on long enough.

11:52.260 --> 11:54.345
- I like this suit.
- You shouldn't...

11:54.429 --> 11:56.347
'Cause it looks like garbage.

11:56.431 --> 11:58.566
Your suit looks
more like garbage.

11:58.633 --> 12:00.017
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

12:00.101 --> 12:02.636
'Cause Brooks Brothers Boys
doesn't make garbage.

12:02.704 --> 12:05.573
Okay, this next thing is
a photography-class assignment.

12:05.640 --> 12:06.740
Can you figure that out?

12:06.808 --> 12:09.743
"Encapsulate the spirit
of melancholy."

12:09.811 --> 12:11.212
- Melancholy.
- Give me this.

12:11.279 --> 12:12.480
Easy.

12:12.547 --> 12:14.481
Boom... a sad desk.

12:14.533 --> 12:17.718
Boom... sad wall.

12:17.786 --> 12:20.204
It's art.
Anything is anything.

12:20.288 --> 12:21.622
Oh, right on.

12:21.690 --> 12:23.090
Uh, I'm gonna go drop this off
and pick up the mail.

12:23.157 --> 12:25.526
Sad floor.

12:25.594 --> 12:28.212
It does look sad...
Kind of.

12:28.296 --> 12:31.549
Sorry for stepping on you, floor.

12:34.302 --> 12:35.569
Hey.

12:35.637 --> 12:37.204
You got Andy
doing all your work for you?

12:37.272 --> 12:39.907
Yes. But he said
he wanted to do it.

12:39.975 --> 12:41.742
I'm only doing it
because I'm getting...

12:41.810 --> 12:42.860
Yeah, I don't care.

12:42.944 --> 12:44.445
I got something to add
to your list.

12:44.512 --> 12:47.548
Yep.
There we go.

12:47.616 --> 12:49.250
That's the stuff.

12:49.317 --> 12:51.869
April really does this every day?

12:51.953 --> 12:53.888
Yes.
Work the heel.

12:53.955 --> 12:55.206
Andy, can I be next?

12:55.290 --> 12:57.190
Yeah.

12:57.242 --> 13:00.628
I've got a corn so big
you could slap butter on it.

13:00.695 --> 13:03.196
Welcome to <i>Ya' Heard with Perd.</i>

13:03.248 --> 13:04.532
I'm Perd Hapley.

13:04.599 --> 13:06.700
The story of our guests today
is that they are

13:06.768 --> 13:08.702
from the Department
of Parks and Recreation...

13:08.770 --> 13:10.304
Ben Wyatt and Tom Haverford.

13:10.372 --> 13:12.473
What up, Perd?
Big fan.

13:12.541 --> 13:15.309
Me too, Perd.
What up?

13:15.376 --> 13:16.977
The thing about
this first question is...

13:17.045 --> 13:19.379
I'd like to ask you
about the Harvest Festival.

13:19.431 --> 13:21.382
Perd, it's gonna be amazing...

13:21.449 --> 13:22.816
Carnival rides, games.

13:22.884 --> 13:26.153
Sweetums is even building
a plus-sized roller coaster

13:26.221 --> 13:28.522
for some of Pawnee's obese
thrill seekers.

13:28.590 --> 13:30.057
You must be this wide to ride.

13:30.125 --> 13:32.927
Wow. That's gonna be
a pretty big roller coaster.

13:32.994 --> 13:34.895
Yep.

13:34.963 --> 13:36.396
Hey, guys, how'd it go?

13:36.448 --> 13:38.398
Well, there were
some sticky moments.

13:38.450 --> 13:40.768
Let's go to the videotape.

13:40.835 --> 13:42.570
Ah! Look...

13:42.637 --> 13:44.405
Who hasn't had gay thoughts?

13:44.472 --> 13:45.673
Who?

13:45.740 --> 13:46.957
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.

13:47.042 --> 13:48.309
I mean, you know,
sometimes I feel like

13:48.376 --> 13:49.476
I might need glasses.

13:49.544 --> 13:52.012
Is there a bird in here?

13:52.080 --> 13:54.465
I swear I keep seeing a bird
in the studio.

13:54.549 --> 13:56.016
How did this happen?

13:56.084 --> 13:57.685
He was fine until Perd
started asking him

13:57.752 --> 13:59.086
about the boy-mayor stuff.

13:59.137 --> 14:01.188
What's wrong with you?
You look psychotic.

14:01.256 --> 14:03.691
I was 18
when I was elected mayor, okay?

14:03.758 --> 14:05.859
So excuse me for that.

14:05.927 --> 14:08.028
Cindy Eckert had just turned me
down for senior prom.

14:08.096 --> 14:09.863
Do you know how that feel...
I should call her.

14:09.931 --> 14:11.699
I should. I...
No, I shouldn't.

14:11.766 --> 14:14.785
And I'm not going to, and
I'm proud of myself for that.

14:14.869 --> 14:17.538
And then he talked
about feeling up Cindy Eckert

14:17.606 --> 14:19.873
for the first time
for about five minutes.

14:19.941 --> 14:21.542
And then the show ended...

14:21.610 --> 14:24.044
As did our careers
and probably Harvest Fest.

14:25.880 --> 14:28.449
Boom... sadness.
That's the one.

14:32.342 --> 14:34.156
Natalie. Hey.

14:34.276 --> 14:35.443
It's me, Andy.

14:35.510 --> 14:37.028
You're an hour and half late.

14:37.096 --> 14:38.096
I know. I know.

14:38.164 --> 14:39.998
I had to massage a ton of feet...

14:40.049 --> 14:41.600
Super sorry.

14:41.668 --> 14:43.702
Come on, get in. I-I need to do
everything on April's list,

14:43.770 --> 14:45.537
or she's not gonna
go out with me.

14:45.605 --> 14:47.272
You're into April?

14:47.340 --> 14:48.807
Ah.
Come on.

14:48.858 --> 14:50.359
We'll talk about it in the car.

14:50.443 --> 14:52.010
Hold on.
I'll get my books.

14:52.061 --> 14:53.445
Okay.

14:53.513 --> 14:55.898
Okay, great.
Call me.

14:55.965 --> 14:58.617
That should be
some damage control.

14:58.685 --> 14:59.918
I'm having dinner
with Perd Hapley.

14:59.986 --> 15:01.103
Tom, what do we have?

15:01.170 --> 15:03.055
I've gotten calls
from a dozen businesses

15:03.122 --> 15:04.590
thinking about pulling
their sponsorships.

15:04.657 --> 15:06.041
Sweetums might cancel
the fat-coaster.

15:06.125 --> 15:07.125
Oh, my God.

15:07.193 --> 15:08.727
Okay, look, we need to focus.

15:08.795 --> 15:10.462
We still have
the <i>Pawnee Today </i> interview.

15:10.529 --> 15:12.030
Well, is it too late to cancel?

15:12.098 --> 15:15.050
Yeah, yeah,
it's too late to cancel.

15:15.134 --> 15:17.202
Joan Callamezzo runs this town.

15:17.253 --> 15:18.437
But, Ben, don't worry about it.

15:18.504 --> 15:19.705
You're not going
in front of the camera.

15:19.772 --> 15:21.390
Fine with me.

15:21.474 --> 15:23.592
Are you trying to lure
this young lady into your van?

15:23.676 --> 15:25.227
Yeah.

15:25.311 --> 15:27.379
But she's being
really difficult about it.

15:27.447 --> 15:29.748
Uh, and it's actually not my van.

15:29.816 --> 15:31.750
Uh, I stole it
from a friend of mine.

15:31.818 --> 15:33.551
I technically
shouldn't be even driving,

15:33.603 --> 15:37.122
because, uh, my license
is crazy expired.

15:38.358 --> 15:39.725
That's, uh, Dwyer.

15:39.792 --> 15:42.194
D-w-y-e-r.

15:42.245 --> 15:43.528
Oh, dude!

15:43.580 --> 15:45.764
Come on,
I got to get out of here!

15:45.832 --> 15:48.333
Natalie, tell this guy
you know me.

15:51.237 --> 15:52.371
Joan!

15:52.438 --> 15:54.306
Oh, I thought
you were Jennifer Aniston

15:54.374 --> 15:56.008
filming a movie here.

15:57.343 --> 15:59.077
Joan, let's make a pact, okay?

15:59.128 --> 16:01.680
If we're both still single
in an hour, let's get married.

16:01.748 --> 16:03.432
Tom, I'm already married.

16:03.516 --> 16:04.933
Oh, that's right, to Seal.

16:05.018 --> 16:06.818
Oh, I confused you
with Heidi Klum again.

16:06.886 --> 16:09.605
- Oh!
- See you later, Joan.

16:09.689 --> 16:11.256
That's how it's done.

16:11.307 --> 16:12.791
Okay, five, four...

16:12.859 --> 16:15.727
Hello, and welcome
to <i>Pawnee Today.</i>

16:15.795 --> 16:17.562
I'm Joan Callamezzo.

16:17.630 --> 16:19.398
Today's guest is Leslie Knope,

16:19.465 --> 16:21.900
who is here to tell us
how this year's Harvest Festival

16:21.968 --> 16:24.069
is going to bankrupt the city.

16:24.137 --> 16:26.038
Well, Joan, actually,
there's a lot

16:26.105 --> 16:28.040
of false information
flying around.

16:28.107 --> 16:30.275
- The Harvest Festival is...
- Just jumping right in.

16:30.343 --> 16:31.677
That's rude.

16:31.744 --> 16:33.211
I just want everyone to know

16:33.279 --> 16:35.080
what an extraordinary event
this is going to be.

16:35.131 --> 16:37.316
But at what cost?

16:37.383 --> 16:40.135
How many cities
does Ben Wyatt need to destroy

16:40.219 --> 16:42.087
before he's put behind bars?

16:42.155 --> 16:43.655
Ben Wyatt has done nothing wrong.

16:43.723 --> 16:47.225
You know, if you want to ask
him questions,

16:47.293 --> 16:48.560
let's go for it, huh?

16:48.628 --> 16:50.362
Just ask any question
about his past or present.

16:50.430 --> 16:52.147
Just get it over with.
Ben, let's get up here.

16:52.231 --> 16:54.066
Yeah, yeah, come on.

16:54.133 --> 16:55.567
We'll just ask him
a bunch of questions,

16:55.635 --> 16:57.402
and then we'll get everything
cleared and out of the way.

16:57.470 --> 16:58.704
Sound good?
Yeah?

16:58.771 --> 16:59.821
- Great.
- Good.

16:59.906 --> 17:01.440
Uh, let's take some calls, Joan.

17:01.491 --> 17:02.808
Why don't you?

17:02.875 --> 17:04.276
Okay.
Uh, caller, are you there?

17:04.327 --> 17:07.378
Yeah, how can you justify
raising taxes

17:07.446 --> 17:09.982
for something
that will hurt the town?

17:10.049 --> 17:13.218
I...

17:13.286 --> 17:15.554
For...

17:15.621 --> 17:18.423
Uh, just to add
to what Ben's stammering about,

17:18.491 --> 17:20.892
um, we aren't going
to raise taxes,

17:20.960 --> 17:23.328
so that's that.

17:23.378 --> 17:24.463
Next caller.

17:26.098 --> 17:28.567
Do you fish, April?

17:28.634 --> 17:30.335
No.
Fish are gross.

17:30.386 --> 17:32.270
Let me give you
a piece of fishing advice.

17:32.338 --> 17:33.438
I said I don't...

17:33.506 --> 17:34.723
When you have a fish on the line,

17:34.807 --> 17:36.108
you don't just drag it
behind the boat.

17:36.175 --> 17:39.244
You either reel it in,
or you cut him loose,

17:39.312 --> 17:41.279
especially if he's a nice fish

17:41.347 --> 17:43.048
with a big, lovable fish heart.

17:43.116 --> 17:44.983
You don't know
what you're talking about.

17:45.034 --> 17:48.253
Maybe not.
Maybe you really do hate Andy.

17:48.321 --> 17:51.857
Maybe moving to Indianapolis
just to get revenge on him

17:51.924 --> 17:54.192
is a really good idea.

17:54.260 --> 17:56.762
What do I know?

18:03.202 --> 18:05.237
You are going to love this.

18:05.304 --> 18:08.774
Verosian tea really supercharges
the bacteria in your colon.

18:08.841 --> 18:11.042
Plus, it smells interesting.
Waft it.

18:11.094 --> 18:13.378
Are we actually ever
gonna drink it,

18:13.446 --> 18:15.013
or we're just gonna sniff it?

18:15.064 --> 18:17.048
I love sniffing.
Don't get me wrong.

18:17.100 --> 18:20.018
You are hilarious.

18:20.069 --> 18:22.070
So you're leaving soon.

18:22.155 --> 18:24.456
Um, back to Indianapolis briefly

18:24.524 --> 18:26.908
and then on to a town
called Snerling, Indiana,

18:26.993 --> 18:28.093
for several months.

18:28.161 --> 18:29.494
Never heard of it.

18:29.562 --> 18:30.829
It's quite small.

18:30.896 --> 18:32.831
The cows outnumber the people
40 to 1.

18:32.899 --> 18:34.866
It sounds amazing.

18:34.934 --> 18:36.734
I like you a lot.

18:36.786 --> 18:39.771
I love spending time with you.

18:39.839 --> 18:42.340
And I thoroughly
enjoy you, Ann Perkins.

18:42.408 --> 18:46.511
I just think we need to talk
about what that means for us.

18:46.579 --> 18:48.013
I don't want to be clingy.
I...

18:48.080 --> 18:50.048
Please, it is something
that we need to figure out,

18:50.099 --> 18:52.150
and we should do that right now.

18:52.218 --> 18:56.521
I'm so happy you said that.

18:56.589 --> 18:58.190
Wow, that's disgusting.

18:58.257 --> 19:01.626
Yes, it's very hard to drink.

19:03.296 --> 19:05.297
Yeah, why should we trust
this Ben Wyatt guy?

19:05.364 --> 19:07.532
Because I'm trusty.

19:07.600 --> 19:09.334
Trust me.
I'm trustworthy.

19:09.402 --> 19:13.872
And I am working very hard to...

19:13.940 --> 19:17.175
Make sure that this town
gets back on its feet.

19:17.243 --> 19:18.776
There we go.
Okay, great.

19:18.828 --> 19:19.911
Next caller.

19:19.962 --> 19:21.713
So I looked you up on Altavista,

19:21.781 --> 19:23.381
and I found out
that the last seven towns

19:23.449 --> 19:25.550
you've gone to ended up bankrupt.

19:25.618 --> 19:26.802
Okay, first of all,

19:26.886 --> 19:30.055
why does everyone in this town
use Altavista?

19:30.123 --> 19:32.190
Is it 1997?

19:32.258 --> 19:34.626
And second,
I am a budget specialist.

19:34.694 --> 19:37.496
I went to those towns
because they were bankrupt,

19:37.563 --> 19:39.231
and now they aren't.

19:39.298 --> 19:41.266
And, yeah, I screwed up
when I was 18,

19:41.317 --> 19:44.402
but who doesn't do dumb stuff
when they're 18?

19:44.470 --> 19:46.571
- Joan?
- I stole my...

19:46.639 --> 19:49.841
gym teacher's husband.

19:49.909 --> 19:52.577
So there you go.

19:52.645 --> 19:55.447
Well, what else
do you got, callers?

19:55.498 --> 19:56.515
Going once, going twi...

19:56.582 --> 19:58.783
- Oh, here we go.
- Yeah, hi.

19:58.835 --> 20:00.418
Um, can you tell me more
about the corn maze

20:00.486 --> 20:01.753
at the Harvest Festival?

20:01.821 --> 20:03.221
Are dogs allowed?

20:06.259 --> 20:07.893
- Hello.
- Hello.

20:07.960 --> 20:09.394
How did it go today?

20:09.462 --> 20:10.795
It was super fun.

20:10.863 --> 20:12.330
- It was?
- Yeah.

20:12.398 --> 20:14.766
Do you have a list for tomorrow?

20:16.335 --> 20:18.103
You want to do this again
tomorrow?

20:18.171 --> 20:19.771
Yes, I do.
I mean, that's the deal, right?

20:19.839 --> 20:21.139
I got to do it for a whole month

20:21.207 --> 20:24.910
and then you're not gonna move
to Indianapolis...

20:25.030 --> 20:30.515
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

20:31.183 --> 20:32.984
I better be the only person
you kissed today.

20:33.052 --> 20:34.953
I am...

20:35.021 --> 20:36.988
I'm positive that you are.

20:40.242 --> 20:41.345
If I thought you were serious,

20:41.346 --> 20:42.812
I'd be offended, Perd,
but I know that we're buddies,

20:42.879 --> 20:44.996
and I know
you wouldn't do that to me.

20:44.997 --> 20:47.816
But, no, this is a birthmark,
Perd, okay?

20:47.883 --> 20:49.984
This is the little scar I got
when I was nine

20:50.052 --> 20:53.638
and I fell off my bike,
so, no, I'm not perfect!

20:53.722 --> 20:55.807
- I can't look away.
- It's a... it's amazing.

20:55.891 --> 20:57.625
Okay, wait, wait, wait, no.
Here's the best part.

20:57.693 --> 21:01.162
Okay, uh, that's all the time
we have here on <i>Ya' Heard.</i>

21:01.230 --> 21:03.314
I'm Perd Hapley, Channel 4.

21:03.399 --> 21:05.850
More like "Turd Crapley."

21:05.935 --> 21:07.535
- Yes, yes.
- Yeah?

21:07.603 --> 21:09.804
- Bravo.
- Thank you very much.
