- with Twenty.
- They had.

Omair Idrisi isn't going to be

That's because I thought they
were working for Omair Idrisi.

I'm undercover... they're undercover.

17:43.960 --> 17:45.360
it's going to be even worse.

17:47.715 --> 17:50.730
You know, it is possible that
I actually drowned back there

17:50.831 --> 17:53.405
and that this is some
kinda fucked up purgatory.

18:08.050 --> 18:10.876
They say that Tibetan monks
can regulate their body

18:10.878 --> 18:12.646
temperature through advanced meditation.

18:12.699 --> 18:15.115
- Are you a Tibetan monk?
- No.

18:15.196 --> 18:17.116
Then why the fuck are you telling me this?

18:18.083 --> 18:19.683
You're quite an intense person.

18:34.972 --> 18:37.091
So, what do you know about Omair Idrisi?

18:37.206 --> 18:41.488
I know 360 people died when he
took down that airbus with his wife.

18:41.984 --> 18:45.011
I know the Syrians grabbed him
a few months back but now he's on

18:45.065 --> 18:46.289
the loose.

18:46.835 --> 18:50.476
And I know for certain that
he is one bad fucking hombre.

18:50.539 --> 18:51.632
I meant your intel.

18:51.687 --> 18:53.969
Yeah, I know what you meant, McAllister.

18:54.196 --> 18:56.436
This is my op' and I'm not sharing.

18:58.427 --> 18:59.798
You know, you remind me,
a little bit, of a guy,

18:59.800 --> 19:01.751
on my squad before... Doyle.

19:01.827 --> 19:02.505
Oh, yeah?

19:02.576 --> 19:06.110
Yeah. He was a bit of a
dick, at times, as well.

19:06.850 --> 19:09.090
Maybe I'll buy him a beer, one day.

19:10.429 --> 19:13.254
He's dead. Omair Idrisi killed him.

19:13.812 --> 19:16.252
And the rest of my team, they
didn't make it home either.

19:21.410 --> 19:23.970
Alright, Alright.

19:25.770 --> 19:28.811
I got word that Idrisi and his woman
were putting together an arms deal.

19:28.875 --> 19:31.879
Big one, millions of dollars.
Serious shit coming down the line.

19:31.931 --> 19:34.166
- Do you know what it was?
- That's what I was digging into.

19:34.236 --> 19:36.565
What they were buying, who
they were getting it from.

19:36.651 --> 19:38.128
Turns out General
Mc-fucking-Waterboard back

19:38.193 --> 19:39.629
there was doing the same thing.

19:39.739 --> 19:42.642
But he gives me the name
of a money man, Khalid.

19:43.142 --> 19:44.218
Ring any bells?

19:44.290 --> 19:47.250
That depends, are we sharing or not.

19:48.277 --> 19:49.757
I guess we're not.

19:50.201 --> 19:52.201
(CAR ENGINES IN THE DISTANCE)

19:53.505 --> 19:56.625
Shit! It's Farid's men.
We need to get to cover.

19:56.770 --> 19:57.770
Move!

20:16.610 --> 20:19.978
Wyatt, McAllister? Colonel Donovan sent me.

20:21.445 --> 20:22.725
Get in.

20:23.929 --> 20:27.220
Up in the back. Don't worry
the ladies will look after you.

20:27.258 --> 20:28.698
(ANIMALS MAKE NOISE)

20:39.010 --> 20:43.216
Lance Corporal Gracie Novin. Special
Operations Command, Engineering.

20:43.290 --> 20:45.760
Great. Maybe you can fix this guy's phone.

20:45.838 --> 20:48.444
It was still sending out
intermittent signals, tracking you.

20:48.476 --> 20:51.314
So, when I got a call from Colonel
Donovan, asking me to pick up

20:51.389 --> 20:53.215
two losers who had got
themselves stuck in the desert...

20:53.290 --> 20:55.762
You guys are aware it gets
to over one-hundred degrees

20:55.830 --> 20:56.978
fahrenheit, right?

20:57.058 --> 20:58.377
It wasn't part of the plan.

20:58.410 --> 21:00.009
No shit it wasn't.

21:00.376 --> 21:01.832
Oh, fuck!

21:01.900 --> 21:03.887
There's a bloody check-point, up ahead.

21:06.250 --> 21:07.243
Just floor it!

21:07.332 --> 21:09.131
This is flooring it sweet-cheeks.

21:09.250 --> 21:11.330
You might want to get down and stay down.

22:04.730 --> 22:07.372
Now that's how you do a fuckin' extraction.

22:29.615 --> 22:30.735
Cold shower huh?

22:33.935 --> 22:38.055
Can I help you? Colonel Donovan's
called a meeting at 18 hundred.

22:38.944 --> 22:40.623
I don't work for Donovan.

22:40.695 --> 22:43.149
Neither did I 'til a couple of hours ago.

22:43.895 --> 22:46.861
But good for you. Handing
over your op like that.

22:48.489 --> 22:51.277
Got a big... heart.

22:52.008 --> 22:54.989
Now, wait on a second...
I'm not handing over shit.

22:55.051 --> 22:57.228
So... meeting at 18 hundred.

23:00.935 --> 23:02.661
That's more your size.

23:17.056 --> 23:19.988
Yeah, it's me, we need to meet, now.

23:44.561 --> 23:46.472
You know this is the first
cup of coffee I've had in this

23:46.521 --> 23:49.319
country that doesn't taste
like someone took a piss in it.

23:50.690 --> 23:51.988
Glad, you're back home safe, Sergeant.

23:52.034 --> 23:53.233
Thank you, sir.

23:53.713 --> 23:55.741
But, listen, there seems to be
some confusion with the British

23:55.803 --> 23:57.762
- over the op'.
- No confusion.

23:57.856 --> 23:59.054
You're still part of it.

23:59.055 --> 24:01.287
I've temporarily attached
you to their command.

24:01.289 --> 24:03.037
I wasn't looking for a transfer, sir.

24:03.105 --> 24:04.494
So, with all due respect, this is bullshit!

24:04.564 --> 24:08.664
Wyatt... you're an excellent soldier.
But you're a goddamn headache.

24:08.734 --> 24:10.048
You're undisciplined, you go off mission...

24:10.095 --> 24:11.894
Don't give me the speech.
Don't give me the speech.

24:11.988 --> 24:15.188
Let us not forget the shit-show in Ghazni.

24:21.128 --> 24:22.861
Alright. So, what? You're freezing me out?

24:23.750 --> 24:26.150
You play nice with your new friends.

24:26.415 --> 24:28.454
And if there's anything
I should know about,

24:28.597 --> 24:31.152
you'll be my eyes and ears on the inside.

24:32.219 --> 24:35.455
You do that, maybe I'll reconsider.

24:39.586 --> 24:41.477
Let you come on home.

25:44.892 --> 25:46.612
- Incoming!
- (GUNSHOT)

25:57.175 --> 25:59.627
Shit! I gotta get to a meeting.

25:59.720 --> 26:01.660
No, stay! It's just a job.

26:01.731 --> 26:04.927
I know, I know. It just turns
out I've changed my mind.

26:05.840 --> 26:09.365
I've got to go to work.
I'm really sorry about this.

26:09.434 --> 26:10.554
But, thank-you.

26:12.410 --> 26:13.570
It's fine.

26:20.688 --> 26:21.767
Sergeant Wyatt.

26:21.961 --> 26:22.964
Glad to have you on board.

26:22.966 --> 26:24.377
I heard you guys could use some help.

26:24.379 --> 26:26.418
You already know Novin and McAllister.

26:26.479 --> 26:27.384
(THUD)

26:27.462 --> 26:29.135
For goodness sake.

26:31.193 --> 26:33.418
Lance Corporal Will Jensen,
from the Intelligence Corps.

26:33.481 --> 26:35.741
Computer guy. Got it. So, this is the team.

26:35.743 --> 26:40.515
And this is the target. Omair
Idrisi and his wife Jane Lowry.

26:40.517 --> 26:42.967
Lowry? I thought she was
killed in a drone strike.

26:43.039 --> 26:44.390
Drone strikes aren't always accurate.

26:44.441 --> 26:45.517
She's from my hometown.

26:45.569 --> 26:46.928
Why doesn't that surprise me?

26:47.452 --> 26:50.501
Radicalised after a spell in
British prison, she married Idrisi

26:50.579 --> 26:52.713
three years ago. The voice in his ear.

26:52.747 --> 26:56.906
And finally their attack dog. Sabil Adiz.

26:57.047 --> 27:00.566
Intel suggests Idrisi is purchasing
weapons for a major attack.

27:00.830 --> 27:03.720
Now, the General mentioned a name
to you, Sergeant Wyatt. Khalid.

27:03.786 --> 27:06.075
Right about the time he was
filling my lungs with dirty water.

27:06.162 --> 27:09.761
This is who he was talking
about. Prince Khalid Al Hebtani.

27:09.817 --> 27:12.216
We suspect he is funding the terrorists.

27:12.280 --> 27:13.657
Alright. So, you want
me to go shake him down?

27:13.738 --> 27:16.777
His fathers on the Saudi rich
list. Very wealthy, very protected.

27:16.857 --> 27:19.817
- So, he's basically untouchable?
- But not unreachable.

27:21.298 --> 27:22.653
This was earlier today.

27:22.735 --> 27:25.898
Right now, he's in Tripoli, charity
work on behalf of his father.

27:25.960 --> 27:27.894
And we know where he's
going to be this evening.

27:27.895 --> 27:29.950
I need you all to rendezvous
with Captain Reynolds and provide

27:29.952 --> 27:32.810
- support...
- Wait, I'm sorry. Captain Reynolds?

27:32.927 --> 27:34.797
I assumed I'd be in charge of the op.

27:34.851 --> 27:35.721
Based on?

27:35.776 --> 27:37.540
Based on the fact that you
wouldn't have shit without me giving

27:37.595 --> 27:38.934
you Khalid's name.

27:38.935 --> 27:40.854
Yeah, this is British Military, mate.

27:40.971 --> 27:42.248
If anything, you'd be following my lead.

27:42.272 --> 27:44.592
It's very sweet that you both
think you'd have a choice.

27:46.186 --> 27:48.146
Jensen, measure them up.

27:49.759 --> 27:51.199
(DANCE MUSIC BLASTS)

28:13.935 --> 28:16.354
That's CCTV from the main
floor of Prince Khalid's

28:16.356 --> 28:17.675
favourite club in Tripoli.

28:17.677 --> 28:20.852
The aptly named 'Karma' and
McAllister and Wyatt on the

28:20.891 --> 28:22.216
bottom right there, Ma'am.

28:22.320 --> 28:24.839
Kill the music and try
and isolate the comms.

28:24.906 --> 28:26.094
Understood Ma'am.

28:26.380 --> 28:28.509
- Comms check.
- Good check.

28:29.407 --> 28:31.047
Novin, on your six.

28:38.295 --> 28:40.564
Still no sign of our Prince.

28:43.320 --> 28:45.720
I would like a Pomegranite Martini.

28:48.376 --> 28:49.495
I'm blending in.

28:49.628 --> 28:52.667
Besides we can't do shit
till we meet the Captain.

28:52.724 --> 28:54.713
Whisky, neat.

29:11.113 --> 29:12.272
There he is.

29:12.749 --> 29:14.700
I'm not one to judge but
he's got that kind of face you

29:14.778 --> 29:16.458
wouldn't get tired of punching.

29:16.775 --> 29:18.034
Ooh, I'd be careful.

29:18.103 --> 29:21.183
Shake his hand the wrong way, it
could be an international incident.

29:24.655 --> 29:26.311
Pomegranate martini?

29:26.472 --> 29:28.023
It has health benefits.

29:28.125 --> 29:30.111
I like a soldier who
looks after themselves.

29:30.169 --> 29:33.054
- Captain Reynolds.
- McAllister. Wyatt.

29:33.472 --> 29:35.365
I need to get close to our target.

29:35.449 --> 29:36.629
Not going to be easy.

29:36.699 --> 29:38.750
He's got shadows on him at all times.

29:39.354 --> 29:41.450
It's going to be easy in this dress.

29:41.505 --> 29:43.025
You two are on back-up.

29:43.578 --> 29:48.230
Clear? And guys, it's a party, lighten up.

29:48.855 --> 29:50.135
Cheers.

29:59.409 --> 30:01.104
Sorry. I'm sorry.

30:01.214 --> 30:04.190
No, no. Please. I am the
one who must apologise.

30:04.256 --> 30:08.071
- Apology accepted.
- Hey, hey. Are you going already?

30:08.916 --> 30:11.035
There was nothing worth hanging around for.

30:11.255 --> 30:14.371
Come with me. I have a
private room upstairs.

30:14.449 --> 30:16.275
It is more quiet, you know.

30:16.411 --> 30:18.330
With the best champagne in the world,

30:18.432 --> 30:20.632
you won't get bored I promise.

30:29.135 --> 30:30.802
I should buy this club.

30:31.615 --> 30:34.054
I should just fucking do it.

what I was thinking,

30:45.757 --> 30:48.251
I was thinking it would
just be the two of us.

30:49.830 --> 30:51.621
What do you say about that?

30:53.600 --> 30:55.548
Why have one bitch when you can have three?

30:55.610 --> 30:56.650

Give me a minute and I
will blow your fucking mind.

31:02.474 --> 31:03.954
Stay there.

31:23.409 --> 31:25.230
Captain Reynolds has started
to clone the phone now, ma'am.

31:25.293 --> 31:27.467
Should be able to pull
any encrypted data from it.

31:27.569 --> 31:29.491
Which should give us a lead on Idrisi.

31:33.186 --> 31:34.878
How's it looking outside?

31:36.377 --> 31:38.687
Hey, computer guy. We're not
getting shit on the comms'.

31:48.375 --> 31:51.450
Stay on him but let this play
out. Idrisi is the end-game.

31:51.502 --> 31:53.529
OK, we need that lead to him.

32:05.335 --> 32:07.137
Keep it cool.

I'll get up there, just
get in that bouncer's face.

for two more up there?

does the Hustle I get five percent.

Come on, do the hustle, do the hustle.

- Come on.

shame me with your begging?

33:11.428 --> 33:14.735
I will answer to Idrisi.
But I will not answer to you.

35:52.776 --> 35:54.594
Khalid, Kahalid.

35:55.635 --> 35:57.633
You pledged your support.

35:57.703 --> 36:01.501
But no support has come.

36:03.273 --> 36:04.664
I relied on you.

36:04.758 --> 36:09.360
OK, we have eyes on bravo team,
moving to the east of the compound.

36:20.595 --> 36:22.915

36:25.709 --> 36:28.625

I've got an idea.

41:45.800 --> 41:46.800
Fuck yeah!

41:51.866 --> 41:53.385
