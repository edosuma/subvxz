WEBVTT

00:38.821 --> 00:40.344
Uh...

00:40.388 --> 00:42.868
Hey, guys?

01:11.462 --> 01:14.117
Make sure
they don't get out.

02:25.319 --> 02:27.364
Aah!

02:27.408 --> 02:29.671
Damn.
You okay?

02:31.063 --> 02:33.936
I almost had it.

02:33.979 --> 02:35.372
Daryl: Nah,
it's too high.

02:35.416 --> 02:36.939
You risk
breakin' your neck.

02:36.982 --> 02:38.245
We need to find
a better way.

02:46.253 --> 02:47.515
You got something?

02:47.558 --> 02:50.344
Groundwater's
deeper in here.

02:50.387 --> 02:52.215
That water's
coming from outside.

02:52.259 --> 02:54.130
Carol: I don't see
a way across.

02:54.174 --> 02:56.176
Whoa, whoa.
Go back, go back.

02:59.440 --> 03:01.442
We could use those
to jump across.

03:01.485 --> 03:05.185
Nice.
Wait.
For real?

03:13.628 --> 03:15.934
All right.

03:15.978 --> 03:18.241
You ready?

03:18.285 --> 03:21.244
Let's go.

03:33.691 --> 03:35.867
Come on.

03:35.911 --> 03:38.261
Let's go!

05:00.125 --> 05:02.171
Do it now!

05:03.999 --> 05:06.306
No!
Hey! Hey!

05:06.349 --> 05:08.003
Hey!
Come on!

05:09.439 --> 05:12.355
Hey, hey!

05:12.399 --> 05:15.097
Come on!
Come on!

05:15.140 --> 05:17.055
Come on.
I gotcha.

05:31.679 --> 05:33.376
Hey! Hey!

05:59.446 --> 06:02.449
Hey,
hand me that thing.

06:03.754 --> 06:06.322
Knock yourself out,
dude.

06:23.861 --> 06:24.862
Alright.

06:24.906 --> 06:26.995
I need you to stay here,all right?

06:27.038 --> 06:28.736
Keep everyone together.

06:37.658 --> 06:39.964
Should I even askhow we're doing on food?

06:40.008 --> 06:41.226
Not great.

06:41.270 --> 06:42.750
Food?

06:42.793 --> 06:45.317
How long do you think
we gonna be here?

06:45.361 --> 06:46.710
Hey,
no worries.

06:46.754 --> 06:49.234
Walkers got in here
somehow.

06:49.278 --> 06:50.671
We'll get out.

06:50.714 --> 06:53.978
I think we knowexactly how they got here.

06:54.022 --> 06:55.502
Alpha put them here.

06:55.545 --> 06:57.373
These are theirs.

06:57.417 --> 07:00.028
We have to assume
we're not alone.

07:04.902 --> 07:06.861
I'm fine.

07:06.904 --> 07:10.560
Just a little winded.

07:10.604 --> 07:12.606
She's claustrophobic.

07:12.649 --> 07:15.478
Why didn't you
think of that

07:15.522 --> 07:17.785
before you got us alltrapped down here?

07:17.828 --> 07:19.264
Hey.

07:19.308 --> 07:21.876
It's not the time
for this.

07:21.919 --> 07:23.268
Why not?

07:23.312 --> 07:25.488
Seems likewe have plenty of it.

07:28.535 --> 07:32.539
What the hellwere you thinking, huh?

07:32.582 --> 07:34.497
Running off like that
by yourself.

07:34.541 --> 07:35.498
Daryl: Hey!

07:35.542 --> 07:37.761
We ain't got time
for this shit.

07:37.805 --> 07:39.110
We got
in this mess together.

07:39.154 --> 07:40.634
We're gonna
get out of it together.

07:40.677 --> 07:41.635
Now follow me.

07:41.678 --> 07:43.854
I think
I found a way out.

08:12.622 --> 08:16.539
The enemy
are watching us.

08:16.583 --> 08:19.020
A small group
crossed the border.

08:19.063 --> 08:21.849
They went straight to the edge
of the national forest.

08:21.892 --> 08:23.328
The horde...

08:23.372 --> 08:26.070
They knewexactly where to look.

08:26.114 --> 08:28.072
Did they find it?

08:28.116 --> 08:31.249
We underestimated them.

08:31.293 --> 08:32.816
We have to assume

08:32.860 --> 08:37.560
they've been sending spies
across the border.

08:37.604 --> 08:41.216
I want more patrols
around the camp.

08:42.522 --> 08:45.002
I want you
to take a message

08:45.046 --> 08:48.266
to our eyes
along the border --

08:48.310 --> 08:49.920
they have failed.

09:47.587 --> 09:49.763
Hey. Can I --
Can I get matches?

09:49.806 --> 09:52.504
You should try to take it easyfor a minute.

09:52.548 --> 09:53.723
I can't.

09:53.767 --> 09:56.857
I need
to do something.

09:56.900 --> 09:58.989
Thanks.

10:19.880 --> 10:23.318
I never told you
I was claustrophobic.

10:24.885 --> 10:26.451
If I only knew
what you told me,

10:26.495 --> 10:28.323
I wouldn't know shit.

10:28.366 --> 10:30.717
Look who's talking.

10:35.243 --> 10:38.942
It's like I can't eventurn my back on you anymore.

10:40.727 --> 10:42.467
It's bad enoughI got Aaron running around

10:42.511 --> 10:43.860
with that skin freak.

10:43.904 --> 10:46.689
Now I gotta worry about you
all half-cocked

10:46.733 --> 10:48.952
every time
you go outside.

10:50.301 --> 10:51.738
I'm sorry.

10:51.781 --> 10:55.742
I begged you
to talk to me.

10:57.526 --> 11:00.268
I wanna be there
for you.

11:00.311 --> 11:02.749
I do.

11:03.880 --> 11:07.710
I don't know
what to do anymore.

11:12.933 --> 11:17.720
I can't stop
thinking about it.

11:17.764 --> 11:21.419
I know I have to,
but I can't.

11:27.556 --> 11:29.863
Oh, God.

11:29.906 --> 11:35.564
I don't want
to just kill Alpha.

11:35.607 --> 11:38.741
I want to hurt her.

11:40.308 --> 11:42.614
I want to make her
regret everything.

11:42.658 --> 11:44.529
I want her to beg
for forgiveness,

11:44.573 --> 11:47.794
and then
I want to kill her.

11:47.837 --> 11:49.056
If I went through

11:49.099 --> 11:51.928
all the shitthat you went through...

11:51.972 --> 11:55.323
I'd probably feel
the same way.

11:57.586 --> 12:00.154
Unless you tried
to stop me.

12:05.115 --> 12:08.553
You gotta quit
all this.

12:08.597 --> 12:10.294
You gotta.

12:10.338 --> 12:14.646
People you care aboutare starting to get hurt.

12:19.956 --> 12:24.700
I didn't mean for any of this
to happen.

12:24.744 --> 12:26.876
I know I have to --

12:26.920 --> 12:29.574
I know
I have to s--

12:29.618 --> 12:32.795
You gotta
not bullshit me.

12:34.231 --> 12:35.842
Don't bullshit me.

12:35.885 --> 12:37.539
You gotta promise.

12:37.582 --> 12:40.803
I gotta knowwe're on the same team.

12:43.153 --> 12:45.590
We fight
for our future.

12:45.634 --> 12:48.724
We don't fight
for revenge.

12:48.768 --> 12:51.379
I promise.

12:56.427 --> 12:58.778
Alright.

13:53.180 --> 13:54.877
Skins!

14:32.784 --> 14:35.570
Let's go.

14:45.101 --> 14:47.060
If we don't follow each other
in the dark,

14:47.103 --> 14:48.888
we're gonna
get split up.

14:48.931 --> 14:51.455
She's right.We stick together.

14:51.499 --> 14:54.328
At least we know
there's a way out now.

14:54.371 --> 14:56.069
Yeah,
but where?

14:56.112 --> 14:58.027
I think
they went this way.

14:58.071 --> 15:00.725
You see
where they went?

15:00.769 --> 15:03.076
Not exactly,
but...

15:03.119 --> 15:06.514
I know a road sign
when I see one.

15:15.740 --> 15:18.526
Hey,
come on.

15:41.810 --> 15:44.552
Negan:
Sorry to butt in.

15:44.595 --> 15:47.772
No pun intended.

15:49.774 --> 15:56.564
The latrine is at the edge
of the camp for hygiene,

15:56.607 --> 15:59.045
not privacy.

16:00.176 --> 16:03.049
Ah, well, actually,
I, um...

16:03.092 --> 16:05.573
just wanted
to talk.

16:05.616 --> 16:07.314
About?

16:07.357 --> 16:10.795
Well, I hear we're supposed to
be keeping our eyes peeled

16:10.839 --> 16:14.190
for a spylurkin' in the woods.

16:14.234 --> 16:17.454
I have an alternate theory
to run by you.

16:17.498 --> 16:20.240
The spy
you're looking for?

16:20.283 --> 16:22.285
Right here
in your camp.

16:22.329 --> 16:26.550
My people know the enemy have
nothing to offer except lies.

16:26.594 --> 16:29.814
Maybe they do.
Maybe they don't.

16:29.858 --> 16:31.033
Believe it or not,

16:31.077 --> 16:33.296
I have beenwhere you are right now.

16:33.340 --> 16:37.039
And if you don't want to end upwhere I am right now,

16:37.083 --> 16:40.086
I suggest you zig
where I zagged.

16:40.129 --> 16:45.526
You and I --
very different.

16:47.267 --> 16:48.616
I had people.

16:48.659 --> 16:50.096
I had a system.

16:50.139 --> 16:51.836
I thoughtthey believed in it,

16:51.880 --> 16:53.186
just like you.

16:53.229 --> 16:54.187
See, the thing is,

16:54.230 --> 16:57.581
you stay king or queenlong enough,

16:57.625 --> 17:00.193
with people telling youall day, every day

17:00.236 --> 17:02.412
that your shit
don't stink,

17:02.456 --> 17:05.459
eventually,you start to believe it.

17:05.502 --> 17:09.245
The thing is...

17:09.289 --> 17:11.639
it still stinks.

17:13.162 --> 17:15.251
Who?

17:15.295 --> 17:19.255
Well, based onmy own personal experience,

17:19.299 --> 17:22.084
I'd saylook closer to home.

17:22.128 --> 17:24.652
And, no,I am not talkin' about

17:24.695 --> 17:26.219
Frankenstein's Hemorrhoid.

17:26.262 --> 17:29.657
That big dudeis clearly a goose stepper.

17:29.700 --> 17:31.093
But the little one...?

17:31.137 --> 17:34.314
You see,she is close enough to you

17:34.357 --> 17:37.186
that she knowsexactly where that horde was.

17:37.230 --> 17:39.101
But she guards
the border,

17:39.145 --> 17:41.103
which meansshe's close enough to the enemy

17:41.147 --> 17:43.192
that they could've
gotten to her.

17:49.459 --> 17:53.550
I will not have you
sowing paranoia.

17:55.161 --> 17:59.208
If you breathe a word of this
to anyone,

17:59.252 --> 18:02.342
I will take these.
Aah!

18:44.645 --> 18:46.429
This is it!

18:50.781 --> 18:53.480
Oh, God.

18:56.047 --> 18:59.181
Alright,
just give me one minute.

18:59.225 --> 19:00.617
I'll be fine.

19:03.446 --> 19:07.276
Or not.

19:07.320 --> 19:10.279
Ooh, boy.

19:22.248 --> 19:25.947
"You are...are...

19:25.990 --> 19:29.690
O-K."

19:31.605 --> 19:33.563
"You are..."

19:34.608 --> 19:36.697
"You are okay."

20:00.024 --> 20:03.376
Oh, man.

20:38.585 --> 20:40.456
Hey.

20:40.500 --> 20:42.458
You all right
back there?

20:42.502 --> 20:43.981
Yeah, sure.

20:44.025 --> 20:46.288
I'm just a 6'2" dude

20:46.332 --> 20:48.290
that had trouble fittinginto airplane bathrooms.

20:48.334 --> 20:49.683
Why wouldn't I be okay?

20:51.250 --> 20:53.208
Fair enough.

21:20.583 --> 21:22.455
Alright, I'm out.

21:22.498 --> 21:24.283
Follow my voice.

21:24.326 --> 21:26.894
Come on.

21:26.937 --> 21:28.896
Follow my voice.

21:28.939 --> 21:30.941
Come on.

21:30.985 --> 21:33.292
That's it.

21:40.951 --> 21:42.518
Alright.

21:42.562 --> 21:44.215
Alright.

21:44.259 --> 21:45.826
Come on.

21:53.268 --> 21:55.226
I'm good.

22:13.157 --> 22:15.856
Carol?

22:15.899 --> 22:18.641
Carol!

22:20.861 --> 22:23.037
I'm here.

22:23.080 --> 22:25.126
You hurt?

22:25.169 --> 22:27.171
I'm okay.

22:27.215 --> 22:30.174
Can you see
my light?

22:30.218 --> 22:32.176
Yes.

22:32.220 --> 22:34.570
Just follow my light.

22:38.835 --> 22:40.489
I can't.

22:40.533 --> 22:42.230
I can't!

22:42.273 --> 22:45.059
Yes, you can.

22:45.102 --> 22:46.408
Come on.

22:46.452 --> 22:49.193
We're gonna
get through this together.

22:49.237 --> 22:51.457
Come on.
Come on.

23:20.268 --> 23:22.618
Go ahead.

23:22.662 --> 23:24.446
I gotcha, I gotcha.

23:34.064 --> 23:35.718
Hey, guys...

23:37.285 --> 23:40.027
Aaron:
What is it?

23:42.595 --> 23:45.293
What is it?

23:45.336 --> 23:47.251
Just be quiet
for a second.

24:00.003 --> 24:02.832
Go, go, go! Go!

24:02.876 --> 24:04.355
Go, go, go!

24:18.544 --> 24:21.068
Jerry, come on!

24:26.552 --> 24:28.205
Come on!
Come on!

24:49.618 --> 24:51.098
Jerry!

24:51.141 --> 24:53.100
Come on!

24:53.143 --> 24:55.929
You're almost there!

24:55.972 --> 24:57.321
Guys!

24:57.365 --> 24:59.628
I'm -- I'm stuck.

25:03.589 --> 25:05.373
Here --
take my hand!

25:08.768 --> 25:11.118
Aah!

25:13.163 --> 25:14.469
My feet!

25:14.513 --> 25:16.515
My feet!
They got my feet!

25:16.558 --> 25:18.125
They're biting my feet!

25:21.563 --> 25:23.434
My feet!

25:23.478 --> 25:25.262
Take your gear off!

25:25.306 --> 25:27.395
Take it off!

25:44.978 --> 25:46.632
Come on.

25:51.245 --> 25:53.290
Aah!

26:06.521 --> 26:08.915
You good?

26:08.958 --> 26:11.178
It's okay.

26:11.221 --> 26:12.658
They didn't bite through.

26:12.701 --> 26:15.530
You're good.It's alright. It's okay.

26:26.062 --> 26:28.543
Hey.

26:28.587 --> 26:30.806
Look!

26:30.850 --> 26:33.200
Wait!

28:03.290 --> 28:06.206
Why are we standing aroundlooking at it?

28:07.947 --> 28:10.732
Kelly: We got to be
very careful.

28:10.776 --> 28:12.734
We take out
the wrong piece,

28:12.778 --> 28:15.041
this whole thing
is gonna collapse.

28:34.582 --> 28:35.757
Where's Gamma?

28:35.801 --> 28:37.716
She never made it
to the border.

28:37.759 --> 28:39.979
I've sent four scouts
to find her.

28:40.022 --> 28:41.937
If there are spies
among us,

28:41.981 --> 28:43.939
maybe she's been captured.

28:43.983 --> 28:46.942
Or she is the spy.

28:46.986 --> 28:48.944
You believe
she has gone over?

28:48.988 --> 28:50.511
I suspect.

28:52.121 --> 28:56.212
I want you
to track her down.

28:56.256 --> 28:58.301
Bring her to me.

28:58.345 --> 29:01.957
And if she has betrayed us,
I will kill her.

29:04.003 --> 29:06.788
I will
deal with her.

29:06.832 --> 29:09.573
And the pack
will watch.

29:15.841 --> 29:19.888
Alright,
find something to dig with.

29:26.329 --> 29:28.679
Hey, Aaron,
can you help me with this?Yeah, yeah.

29:39.473 --> 29:41.736
Kelly:Hey, check this out.

29:41.780 --> 29:42.955
Yo.

29:42.998 --> 29:45.218
Somebody leftthis crate of dynamite.

29:45.261 --> 29:49.004
Yeah, okay,
that's really cool.

29:49.048 --> 29:50.876
But maybe
somebody left it there

29:50.919 --> 29:53.748
because it's obviously
insanely dangerous.

29:53.792 --> 29:55.837
That thing's sweatier
than I am.

29:55.881 --> 29:57.621
I need you
to put it back.

29:57.665 --> 29:59.493
Very carefully.

30:02.452 --> 30:05.673
Just -- Just...

30:15.901 --> 30:16.989
Want to
take a break?

30:17.032 --> 30:19.078
I can rest when --
when we get home.

30:19.121 --> 30:22.995
You in a hurry?
I just
don't wanna hang out here

30:23.038 --> 30:24.518
any longer
than I have to.

30:24.561 --> 30:25.824
Do you?

30:25.867 --> 30:28.000
No, but...

30:28.043 --> 30:32.656
you barely rested,
haven't eaten anything.

30:32.700 --> 30:35.921
You never stop.

30:39.272 --> 30:44.059
I didn't leave things goodwith Yumiko.

30:46.322 --> 30:49.282
I'm sorry.

30:49.325 --> 30:51.675
Me too.

30:58.900 --> 31:00.902
You.

31:03.949 --> 31:06.690
Looks like
Mom's mad at me.

31:18.354 --> 31:21.096
Keep walkin'.

31:23.490 --> 31:26.058
You know, this feels like
some sort of...

31:26.101 --> 31:28.625
fraternity initiation.

31:28.669 --> 31:31.150
Is that
what this is?

31:31.193 --> 31:32.716
Huh?

31:32.760 --> 31:34.196
Am I gonna get
my skin suit

31:34.240 --> 31:38.418
and finally get to learnthe secret Whisperer handshake?

31:39.462 --> 31:41.900
Eyes front.

31:43.466 --> 31:44.990
Alright.

31:45.033 --> 31:46.643
You don't wanna talk?

31:46.687 --> 31:48.123
I'm down with that.

31:48.167 --> 31:52.040
We just won't talk.

31:56.784 --> 31:58.090
You know, I...

31:58.133 --> 32:00.527
I'm big enough to admit it,alright?

32:00.570 --> 32:01.963
I...

32:02.007 --> 32:06.011
I am not good with long,uncomfortable silences.

32:09.579 --> 32:12.278
Stop here.

32:13.583 --> 32:16.151
I said...

32:16.195 --> 32:20.025
eyes front.

32:21.765 --> 32:23.637
Shit.

32:38.043 --> 32:41.133
Take off your clothes.

32:56.061 --> 32:59.020
You know what?You were -- You were right.

32:59.064 --> 33:02.415
We are different.

33:04.852 --> 33:08.551
I made myself
into a monster,

33:08.595 --> 33:13.078
because that iswhat the world needed.

33:17.473 --> 33:20.433
I built something.

33:20.476 --> 33:23.218
I saved people.

33:23.262 --> 33:26.439
My name --
it meant something.

33:26.482 --> 33:29.094
Turn around.

33:41.671 --> 33:44.326
Whoa.

33:46.633 --> 33:50.071
You're a crass man.

33:50.115 --> 33:52.639
I reckoned
you might appreciate

33:52.682 --> 33:54.597
a crass reward.

33:56.121 --> 33:58.471
A reward?

33:58.514 --> 34:01.169
For what?

34:02.997 --> 34:05.739
The spy.

34:05.782 --> 34:08.176
Gamma.

34:09.482 --> 34:13.268
It took courage
to do what you did.

34:13.312 --> 34:16.228
And I want
to express my gratitude

34:16.271 --> 34:19.709
in a way
that you will understand.

34:19.753 --> 34:21.276
Wait.

34:21.320 --> 34:23.931
Are you just gonna...

34:23.974 --> 34:26.455
leave that mask on?

34:29.284 --> 34:32.287
Does my true skin
disturb you?

34:35.551 --> 34:37.553
Not at all.

34:37.597 --> 34:41.209
Weirdly the opposite.

34:43.385 --> 34:45.213
Wait.

34:45.257 --> 34:47.259
Wait.

34:47.302 --> 34:51.654
This isn't some sort of, uh,praying mantis situation, is it?

34:51.698 --> 34:55.093
You cut off my head offafterwards?

35:03.188 --> 35:04.624
Yeah, sorry.

35:04.667 --> 35:08.193
I can't help but noticethat you didn't say no to that.

35:09.237 --> 35:11.152
Ah,
you know what?

35:11.196 --> 35:13.981
It's been
a long time.

35:14.024 --> 35:18.159
I reckonI will take my chances.

35:23.382 --> 35:27.168
Stop...talking.

35:40.790 --> 35:43.663
Come on, go.

35:49.190 --> 35:50.757
Just a little more!

35:53.238 --> 35:55.979
Where's Carol?

35:58.765 --> 36:00.375
Damn it!

37:37.733 --> 37:39.431
Oh.

37:39.474 --> 37:42.477
Aah!

38:02.932 --> 38:04.891
Daryl:
Take my hand.

38:04.934 --> 38:07.894
Come on.

38:22.169 --> 38:24.867
What the hell
are you doing?

38:27.522 --> 38:31.352
We can take out half her hordefrom here.

38:31.396 --> 38:34.529
You're gonna
get yourself killed.

38:39.404 --> 38:42.276
She killed my boy.

38:43.799 --> 38:45.410
I know.

38:45.453 --> 38:47.499
But you gotta
come back with me.

38:47.542 --> 38:51.372
Please.

38:51.416 --> 38:53.853
Come on.

38:55.463 --> 38:58.161
Aah!

39:12.001 --> 39:14.308
Come on!

39:14.352 --> 39:16.528
Hey! Move!

39:26.755 --> 39:28.714
Hey! Hey!

39:28.757 --> 39:30.542
Come on!

39:30.585 --> 39:32.413
Come on!

39:32.457 --> 39:34.676
What are you doing?!

39:38.637 --> 39:40.987
Come on!

39:45.208 --> 39:47.123
Ohh!

39:52.607 --> 39:53.956
We got freaks!

40:22.550 --> 40:25.074
Magna:
Come on!

40:25.118 --> 40:27.599
Come on!
Hurry!

40:27.642 --> 40:29.035
I can't --

40:31.951 --> 40:34.867
Aaron:
Come on!

40:34.910 --> 40:37.652
Come on, guys!

40:37.696 --> 40:40.307
Come on!

40:47.706 --> 40:49.359
Give me your hand!
I'll pull her up!

40:49.403 --> 40:50.839
Come on!

40:50.883 --> 40:53.494
Give me your hand.

41:07.682 --> 41:09.945
We've got more skins!

41:18.954 --> 41:21.609
Get outta here!

41:21.653 --> 41:23.959
Jerry!
Aah!

41:24.003 --> 41:26.658
Jerry,
give me your hand!
Aah!

41:28.616 --> 41:31.010
Jerry, now!

41:31.053 --> 41:32.925
Come on!

41:54.163 --> 41:56.339
No!

41:56.383 --> 41:57.863
No!

41:57.906 --> 41:59.429
No!

41:59.473 --> 42:01.170
No!

42:01.214 --> 42:03.738
No!

42:13.792 --> 42:18.144
Aaron: Daryl...

42:18.187 --> 42:21.234
Daryl.

42:24.498 --> 42:25.717
It'll take us a weekto clear this.

42:25.760 --> 42:28.328
Then help me!

42:28.371 --> 42:33.159
No.

42:33.202 --> 42:35.814
We can't!

42:37.163 --> 42:41.297
That blast is gonna call
walkers and Whisperers

42:41.341 --> 42:44.257
from a hundred miles
from here.

42:44.300 --> 42:46.999
We don't want our backs
pressed against this mountain

42:47.042 --> 42:49.915
when they come.

42:49.958 --> 42:54.180
We can't save them
if we're dead.

42:55.964 --> 42:59.098
Come on.

43:09.804 --> 43:13.199
Go ahead and say it to me.

43:13.242 --> 43:15.636
I deserve it.

43:15.680 --> 43:18.813
Just say it to me.

43:18.857 --> 43:21.424
You were right
about everything.

43:21.468 --> 43:23.209
Just say it.

43:23.252 --> 43:26.168
No, please.

43:26.212 --> 43:27.648
You cared about her.

43:27.692 --> 43:29.781
And now she's gone
because of me.

43:29.824 --> 43:33.436
Please,
just say it!

43:33.480 --> 43:37.136
Please say it!

43:39.704 --> 43:41.967
Go home.

43:42.010 --> 43:45.797
Tell the others
we found the horde.

43:45.840 --> 43:46.754
Where you gonna be?

43:46.798 --> 43:49.801
They got out before us.

43:49.844 --> 43:54.501
There's gotta be
another way in.

44:07.209 --> 44:09.690
Carol: No.
