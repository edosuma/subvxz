Well, uh, it may be time for you

each other.

at Claire and Larry,

she looked the most normal.

she's a politician.

If a politician is someone who...

and bosses her friends around,

15:09.667 --> 15:13.000
then you're right.

to be the voice of the people,

not just the Drama Club.

-I have to appeal to everyone?
