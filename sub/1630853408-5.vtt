WEBVTT

00:06.881 --> 00:09.426
The thing about living
with time travel,

00:09.426 --> 00:10.969
it's never your only problem.

00:10.969 --> 00:13.221
You get all
the normal problems too.

00:18.059 --> 00:19.227
Like, for instance...

00:24.441 --> 00:25.525
her friends.

00:27.485 --> 00:28.903
- Hi.
- Hey.

00:33.116 --> 00:36.035
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:47.046 --> 00:48.506
Thanks.
Yeah.

00:54.220 --> 00:58.349
- So, how's Clare?
- Good, she's good. Yeah.

00:58.433 --> 00:59.768
- Same old Clare.
- Yeah.

01:11.279 --> 01:13.615
- Charisse?
- Good, yeah.

01:13.615 --> 01:14.908
We've gotta ask, right?

01:14.908 --> 01:16.701
Because if we don't,
when we get back to them

01:16.785 --> 01:17.744
they're gonna ask, yeah?

01:17.744 --> 01:18.995
Charisse will ask,
"How's Clare?"

01:18.995 --> 01:20.288
Clare will ask,
"How's Charisse?"

01:20.288 --> 01:22.165
And if we don't ask,
we're in trouble. Am I right?

01:22.165 --> 01:23.666
Well, they live
in the same apartment.

01:23.750 --> 01:25.210
They probably
know how each other are.

01:25.210 --> 01:26.336
Yeah. Good point.

01:28.463 --> 01:29.839
I-- I was kind
of joking, really.

01:29.923 --> 01:31.800
- Right. Sure.
- Observational humor.

01:31.800 --> 01:33.343
Got you! Yeah.

01:38.890 --> 01:40.558
Why do you look at me like that?

01:40.642 --> 01:42.185
- Like what?
- I don't know. Like that.

01:42.185 --> 01:43.144
Like what?

01:43.228 --> 01:44.896
You've always given me
funny looks.

01:46.815 --> 01:48.900
- You're a time traveler.
- I'm aware.

01:48.900 --> 01:51.736
You're the first interesting
thing that ever happened to me.

01:51.820 --> 01:53.363
I mean, I'm a lawyer.

01:53.363 --> 01:55.782
I'd literally get paid
to prevent interesting things

01:55.782 --> 01:57.492
from happening.
And now look at me.

01:58.409 --> 02:00.161
I'm friends
with a time traveler.

02:00.245 --> 02:02.747
- Are you, though?
- Am I what?

02:02.831 --> 02:04.624
You and me,
are we actually friends?

02:04.624 --> 02:05.917
Well, according to you we are.

02:05.917 --> 02:07.335
According to me,
what does that mean?

02:07.335 --> 02:08.711
Well, not you you,
you from the future.

02:08.795 --> 02:12.006
- What does he know?
- Hell of a lot more than you.

02:13.925 --> 02:15.218
You know,
It just doesn't seem like

02:15.218 --> 02:16.261
we've got a lot in common,

02:16.261 --> 02:17.720
- you know what I'm saying?
- Mm-hmm.

02:17.804 --> 02:20.056
Yeah. I mean,
apart from the obvious.

02:20.056 --> 02:21.224
- The obvious?
- Yeah.

02:21.224 --> 02:22.934
Apart from the fact
we both want to fuck Clare.

02:23.810 --> 02:25.687
No! No, no, that-- that is not--

02:25.687 --> 02:26.855
- That is in no way true.
- Relax!

02:26.855 --> 02:28.231
- It's okay.
- I want you to understand

02:28.231 --> 02:29.357
that that is no way true.

02:29.357 --> 02:32.026
It's fine, it's fine,
I get it. All right.

02:32.110 --> 02:33.152
I mean, do anything about it,

02:33.236 --> 02:34.529
and I'll tie a knot
in your windpipe,

02:34.529 --> 02:38.491
but, uh, short of that,
I graciously accept the tribute

02:38.575 --> 02:40.076
of your debilitating envy.

02:40.827 --> 02:42.120
Cheers.

02:45.248 --> 02:47.750
- You need to take that back.
- It's not a problem, man.

02:47.834 --> 02:49.794
- You need to apologize.
- HENRY DETAMBLE, 28: For what?

02:49.878 --> 02:51.296
I don't have feelings
of that kind

02:51.296 --> 02:53.131
or of any kind for Clare.

02:53.131 --> 02:55.466
- Oh, sure you don't.
- You should apologize!

02:55.550 --> 02:56.759
You should sit back down
on your ass

02:56.843 --> 02:58.261
before it starts talking again.

03:00.346 --> 03:02.682
All right, we tried to have
a drink, it didn't work.

03:02.682 --> 03:03.933
Let's just leave it at that.

03:04.893 --> 03:06.102
Listen.

03:06.102 --> 03:08.271
If you think that I'm giving you
funny looks the whole time,

03:08.271 --> 03:10.023
maybe there's a reason
that you don't know about.

03:10.023 --> 03:11.733
Oh, if you're gonna put
your hand on my knee,

03:11.733 --> 03:13.067
maybe you should buy
me dinner first.

03:13.151 --> 03:16.237
- I've seen you before.
- I know. I was drunk.

03:18.156 --> 03:19.574
- Before that.
- Before when?

03:19.574 --> 03:21.618
- That wasn't the first time.
- HENRY, 28: Oh, when was it then?

03:21.618 --> 03:23.745
- I recognized you.
- Where from?

03:23.745 --> 03:26.748
Hmm, see, if we had been having
a pleasant drink,

03:27.457 --> 03:28.917
maybe I'd have told you!

03:39.886 --> 03:43.348
♪ ("TIME TRAVELER'S WIFE"
THEME MUSIC PLAYING) ♪

05:24.073 --> 05:25.283
Can I have a rest?

05:25.283 --> 05:27.493
Rest from what?
You're just sitting.

05:32.248 --> 05:34.167
- Can I see it?
- Not yet.

05:37.295 --> 05:38.796
I hope you remember
I'm wearing clothes.

05:40.131 --> 05:41.090
How did you know?

05:41.174 --> 05:42.592
Well, I've seen
the finished picture.

05:43.676 --> 05:44.677
That's cheating.

05:44.761 --> 05:46.721
Well, so is drawing me
without any clothes.

05:50.641 --> 05:52.602
- What was that?
- Nothing.

05:53.436 --> 05:54.562
A squirrel or something.

05:54.562 --> 05:56.064
What makes you think
I don't know exactly

05:56.064 --> 05:58.232
- who that was?
- It was nobody.

05:58.316 --> 06:00.193
I've met your family, remember.

06:02.820 --> 06:03.946
Long time ago.

06:06.783 --> 06:07.825
Why are you smiling?

06:09.452 --> 06:12.497
- Well, I guess it was funny.
- What was funny about it?

06:12.497 --> 06:13.873
HENRY, 38: You.

06:13.873 --> 06:15.458
- Me?
- HENRY, 38: Yeah.

06:15.458 --> 06:19.796
You, Clare Abshire.
You're very, very funny.

06:29.764 --> 06:32.225
Do you hate your parents,
or something?

06:32.225 --> 06:34.435
No, of course not.
Why would I hate them?

06:34.519 --> 06:36.646
You seem to have moved
a very long way away from them.

06:40.483 --> 06:42.276
Are we gonna
be there soon?

06:42.360 --> 06:43.444
It's not far.

06:50.785 --> 06:53.538
Sit back. Relax.
What's wrong with you?

06:54.622 --> 06:55.665
I'm in a car.

06:55.665 --> 06:57.500
CLARE ABSHIRE, 20:
Okay, what's wrong with cars?

06:57.500 --> 06:59.418
Me. I'm what's wrong.

06:59.502 --> 07:00.545
If I time travel now,

07:00.545 --> 07:03.005
wherever I arrive,
I'll be doing sixty.

07:03.089 --> 07:05.174
Somewhere in history,
there'll be a big splat

07:05.258 --> 07:06.926
with a surprised-looking face
in the middle.

07:22.900 --> 07:24.569
Your phone keeps buzzing.

07:24.569 --> 07:26.529
- Yeah.
- But you don't answer it.

07:26.529 --> 07:27.947
Yeah, it's nothing.

07:27.947 --> 07:30.616
Careful. I might start thinking
it's your other woman.

07:31.701 --> 07:33.452
Well, it is.

07:34.078 --> 07:37.373
- Ingrid?
- No. Gomez.

07:37.373 --> 07:41.043
- Gomez?
- Yeah we had a, uh, little tiff.

07:41.127 --> 07:42.628
Well, he's just trying
to be friendly.

07:42.712 --> 07:44.547
Well, he needs to stop that.

07:44.547 --> 07:46.299
He's gonna be
your best friend okay,

07:46.299 --> 07:47.717
like it or not.

07:47.717 --> 07:50.094
- Says who?
- Says future you.

07:50.178 --> 07:51.637
You don't want to listen to him.

07:51.721 --> 07:53.556
I am well known
for being a lying asshole.

07:53.556 --> 07:55.975
Well, future you isn't.
Future you is awesome.

07:55.975 --> 07:57.476
Could you stop preferring me
to my face?

07:57.560 --> 08:00.730
He's you but awesome,
how could I not prefer him?

08:00.730 --> 08:02.023
Oh, great. Perfect.

08:02.023 --> 08:03.816
There's exactly one of me
in the world

08:03.900 --> 08:05.818
and I'm coming second.

08:05.902 --> 08:07.236
I mean, is there anything
I do better?

08:07.320 --> 08:10.406
What about the-- the hair?
Is the hair any better?

08:10.406 --> 08:14.285
The sex is good.
I really like the sex.

08:14.285 --> 08:17.622
Oh, well, that's, uh, good.
Thank you for the feedback.

08:17.622 --> 08:19.999
Well, I mean, I'm basically
betraying the love of my life

08:19.999 --> 08:23.502
with his hot kid brother,
but... it's good.

08:23.586 --> 08:26.380
Well, you put it like that
and it does sound good. Thanks.

08:32.637 --> 08:33.679
Gomez?

08:33.763 --> 08:34.805
- Yeah.
- Answer it.

08:34.889 --> 08:37.016
- Do I have to?
- Yes. And be nice.

08:38.226 --> 08:40.269
Hey.

08:40.353 --> 08:42.897
- Hey there, comrade.
- Comrade.

08:42.897 --> 08:44.815
<i>So, you're on
the road then, with Clare.</i>

08:45.524 --> 08:46.567
Everything going okay?

08:46.651 --> 08:48.402
Yeah sure.
<i>No time travel issues?</i>

08:48.486 --> 08:50.529
HENRY, 28: <i>Well I showed up
in Dallas in '63,</i>

08:50.613 --> 08:51.572
and shot up a motorcade.

08:51.656 --> 08:53.115
I hope I didn't change
anything important.

08:53.199 --> 08:56.077
- Joking, right?
- Yeah, I'm joking.

08:56.077 --> 08:58.246
I gotta get used to you
and your sense of humor.

08:58.246 --> 09:00.331
Well, that would save
a certain amount of time.

09:00.331 --> 09:03.000
- Hey listen, yesterday?
- HENRY, 28: <i>Ah, forget about it.</i>

09:03.084 --> 09:04.377
I'm sorry I blew up at you.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.170
It's fine.
We were both out of order.

09:06.254 --> 09:07.672
I'm totally happy
to forget about it.

09:08.172 --> 09:10.007
- Me too.
- Good.

09:11.342 --> 09:12.551
Oh, um,

09:12.635 --> 09:15.137
and, uh, the other thing I said
about seeing you a while back,

09:15.221 --> 09:17.848
<i>how I recognized you
the first time I saw you.</i>

09:17.932 --> 09:19.725
Mm-hmm
<i>Is it, um...</i>

09:21.435 --> 09:23.396
Is it okay to tell you
about that?

09:23.396 --> 09:25.481
- HENRY, 28: <i>Yeah sure it is.</i>
- It like...

09:26.524 --> 09:28.609
It doesn't affect causality?

09:29.610 --> 09:30.778
Sorry, what?
Let's go.

09:30.778 --> 09:34.031
Well, does-- does telling you
affect the causality

09:34.115 --> 09:37.034
- you know, of time.
- The causality of time?

09:37.994 --> 09:39.537
Do you--

09:39.537 --> 09:41.497
do you listen to the words
coming out of your mouth,

09:41.497 --> 09:43.624
or do you just hang around
in the same room as them?

09:43.708 --> 09:45.251
<i>You know what, Henry?</i>

09:46.002 --> 09:47.003
Fuck you, man!

09:47.003 --> 09:49.171
No, no, no, wait, wait.
I'm joking, man. I'm--

09:50.756 --> 09:52.008
Again, I'm joking.

09:52.967 --> 09:55.720
We don't like each other.

09:55.720 --> 09:57.346
How is he supposed
to be my best friend

09:57.430 --> 09:59.598
if we don't like each other?

10:01.892 --> 10:03.144
I don't like him.

10:03.144 --> 10:04.854
But he's gonna be
your best friend.

10:04.854 --> 10:08.107
How? How's that even possible?

10:10.735 --> 10:13.946
Well. There it is.
There's where I come from.

10:14.030 --> 10:16.073
- Meadowlark House.
- HENRY, 28: Okay.

10:17.241 --> 10:19.952
Big. I'd say, uh, big.

10:20.036 --> 10:21.954
It's weird to think
you've never seen it.

10:22.038 --> 10:23.331
HENRY, 28:
One family in this place.

10:23.331 --> 10:24.999
What do you need
all the other rooms for?

10:25.750 --> 10:27.251
Our issues.

10:29.378 --> 10:31.547
CLARE, 34: <i>The trouble
with revisiting your childhood</i>

10:31.547 --> 10:34.717
<i>is nothing is quite
where you left it.</i>

10:34.717 --> 10:37.345
<i>You tell yourself it all looks
exactly the same</i>

10:37.345 --> 10:39.597
<i>and then somebody else sees it.</i>

10:56.072 --> 10:58.532
That's Mark. Promise
you won't out-asshole him.

10:58.616 --> 11:00.534
Well, it's not like
it's a competitive thing.

11:00.618 --> 11:01.619
Promise?

11:01.619 --> 11:03.120
- I promise.
- Thank you.

11:03.204 --> 11:08.209
There she is.

11:08.209 --> 11:10.711
So, this is the young man
in question, is that right?

11:10.795 --> 11:14.590
Mom, Dad, Mark,
this is Henry DeTamble.

11:14.590 --> 11:15.633
Good to meet you.

11:15.633 --> 11:17.676
- Call me Philip.
- Ah! I'm Lucille.

11:17.760 --> 11:20.137
- Please, welcome to our home.
- Lucille, hi.

11:20.221 --> 11:22.348
Sorry, did you say Mom?
How's that possible?

11:22.348 --> 11:24.475
How is this your mom?
What, were you eleven?

11:24.475 --> 11:28.145
Oh! Don't be silly.

11:28.229 --> 11:30.231
So, you're the lucky guy
who's been violating

11:30.231 --> 11:33.484
- my kid sister, yeah?
- Yeah, well, you know...

11:35.111 --> 11:36.153
one of them.

11:38.656 --> 11:40.449
- Uh. That's for you.
- Thank you.

11:40.533 --> 11:41.492
- Yes.
- Yes.

11:41.492 --> 11:43.786
- Please. Come on in.
- Yes, yes, let's go.

11:43.786 --> 11:46.205
So, Clare tells us you work
at the Newberry Library.

11:46.205 --> 11:48.040
HENRY, 28: Yeah, the Newberry,
that's right.

11:48.124 --> 11:51.127
- You're a librarian.
- Yes. Special collections.

11:51.127 --> 11:52.294
Ah.

11:52.378 --> 11:54.422
So,
what are your long-term plans?

11:54.422 --> 11:56.757
- Philip.
- What?

11:56.841 --> 11:58.342
HENRY, 28:
Pretty much that, you know.

11:58.426 --> 11:59.885
Books aren't going anywhere.

12:01.011 --> 12:02.054
Okay.

12:05.057 --> 12:06.976
You ever been to the Newberry?

12:06.976 --> 12:08.894
Sometimes we take clients there.

12:08.978 --> 12:10.312
Corporate events. My law firm.

12:10.396 --> 12:12.356
Oh, right, yeah, Clare said
you're a lawyer. That's cool.

12:12.940 --> 12:13.941
Yeah, for my sins.

12:18.195 --> 12:19.447
My friend's a lawyer. So,

12:19.447 --> 12:22.158
that's basically...
...two lawyers that I know.

12:22.158 --> 12:24.702
- Three. Also a lawyer.
- Almost a lawyer.

12:24.702 --> 12:26.245
Basically a lawyer.

12:26.245 --> 12:28.080
Well, a couple of lawyers
in the family, huh?

12:28.164 --> 12:30.249
Hmm. Yes. We're very proud.

12:30.249 --> 12:33.586
And that's gotta come in handy,
right? If anyone breaks the law.

12:37.131 --> 12:39.592
I don't--
I don't think we would.

12:39.592 --> 12:41.177
Not that you ever would.
I just mean,

12:41.177 --> 12:43.345
there's-- there's a safety net.

12:43.762 --> 12:45.055
Uh...

12:45.139 --> 12:46.348
If you ever wanted to...

12:47.600 --> 12:48.809
cut loose.

12:53.772 --> 12:55.524
- What's your friend's name?
- What friend?

12:55.608 --> 12:58.277
- Your lawyer friend.
- Oh, yeah, Gomez.

12:58.277 --> 13:00.362
Jeff Gomez?
Oh, no, he's in Kentucky now.

13:00.446 --> 13:02.198
What's-- what's his full name?
I might know him.

13:02.198 --> 13:03.824
I know a lot of the young ones.

13:05.910 --> 13:09.830
Just, uh... Gomez.
We call him Gomez.

13:13.918 --> 13:15.211
- Hey, there.
- It's Gomilinsky.

13:15.211 --> 13:16.587
Gomilinsky, good to meet you.

13:16.587 --> 13:20.216
No! No, that's-- No,
Gomez is short for Gomilinsky.

13:20.216 --> 13:22.718
It's sort of like a nickname.
Jan Gomilinsky.

13:22.718 --> 13:24.053
- HENRY, 28: Right.
- We call him Gomez.

13:24.053 --> 13:25.721
- Yeah, forgot that.
- CLARE, 20: Uh-huh.

13:26.597 --> 13:28.182
You forgot his name?

13:28.182 --> 13:32.019
Yeah, you know, sometimes
you forget your friends, uh...

13:32.019 --> 13:33.229
...names.

13:38.609 --> 13:42.488
So, this is you. The blue room.
Uh, bathroom's through there.

13:42.488 --> 13:46.033
- I'm gonna get you some towels.
- There's nothing blue in here.

13:46.033 --> 13:48.410
It used to be blue.
The name stuck.

13:49.453 --> 13:52.206
- Where's your room?
- Why?

13:52.206 --> 13:54.208
Oh, I just wanted to see it.

13:54.208 --> 13:56.919
And memorize the route,
so I can find it in the dark.

13:57.962 --> 13:58.963
Come on.

14:01.298 --> 14:03.384
We seem to be a very long way
from each other.

14:03.384 --> 14:05.594
Can't imagine what my parents
were thinking.

14:13.477 --> 14:14.478
Wow.

14:22.152 --> 14:23.153
HENRY, 28: Oh.

14:24.822 --> 14:26.782
- Is that the meadow?
- Yeah.

14:26.782 --> 14:29.034
And on the other side
are the woods, and in the woods

14:29.118 --> 14:30.911
is the clearing
where we're gonna meet.

14:31.328 --> 14:32.413
Oh.

14:32.413 --> 14:34.206
God, it's so weird
you don't know that.

14:37.084 --> 14:39.169
- Smaller than I thought.
- What is?

14:39.253 --> 14:41.255
The meadow.
I thought it'd be bigger.

14:42.423 --> 14:45.175
Um, it seemed big to me.

14:45.259 --> 14:48.762
But then I suppose everything's
bigger when you're little.

14:49.638 --> 14:51.098
Bigger and more important.

14:54.810 --> 14:56.103
But you, uh,
you've been back there

14:56.103 --> 14:57.313
since you were a kid, right?

14:57.313 --> 15:00.441
Yeah, but, you know,
seeing it through your eyes now.

15:00.441 --> 15:03.819
Can we go see it?
The clearing in the woods.

15:06.614 --> 15:08.741
Maybe, yeah, after lunch.

15:10.618 --> 15:11.619
Maybe?

15:12.536 --> 15:14.455
- Uh, sensing a problem.
- No.

15:15.873 --> 15:16.915
What?

15:20.002 --> 15:22.171
It's just...

15:22.171 --> 15:23.380
Just what?

15:24.506 --> 15:25.591
It's the clearing.

15:26.634 --> 15:28.761
Yeah.

15:30.429 --> 15:32.848
The clearing was our place.

15:35.517 --> 15:37.061
As in, our place.

15:37.061 --> 15:39.438
- CLARE, 20: Well, yes.
- As in, I'm him.

15:39.438 --> 15:40.981
Clare, I'm the man
you met there.

15:41.065 --> 15:42.650
- Yes, I know.
- It's me, Clare.

15:42.650 --> 15:44.276
I'm Henry. The same Henry.

15:45.444 --> 15:46.445
Someday.

15:50.908 --> 15:52.368
You don't like me being here,
do you?

15:54.203 --> 15:56.121
Like this place belongs
to the other me.

15:56.205 --> 15:59.208
- That's stupid.
- Yeah, it is. But is it true?

16:01.460 --> 16:03.921
You could always try
to be nice to me, you know.

16:03.921 --> 16:05.881
It could become a habit.
Like, a thing we do.

16:07.800 --> 16:10.177
- I win.
- What? You beat me again.

16:10.177 --> 16:12.262
- I'm getting better.
- No, you're not.

16:15.182 --> 16:16.475
I am nice.

16:16.475 --> 16:18.352
Yeah, but you keep looking
disappointed that I'm not him.

16:18.352 --> 16:19.728
Well, you keep not being him.

16:19.812 --> 16:21.063
Apparently, I'm gonna get there.

16:23.232 --> 16:26.068
Don't you ever think
how amazing it must be

16:26.068 --> 16:28.237
to fall in love
in the right order?

16:31.281 --> 16:32.616
Call me sentimental, but I...

16:34.118 --> 16:37.413
think it has some pretty
amazing qualities right now.

16:37.413 --> 16:39.665
- Careful.
- HENRY, 28: Sorry.

16:39.665 --> 16:41.917
Don't just throw my things.

16:41.917 --> 16:43.460
You really like checkers
that much?

16:43.544 --> 16:46.380
Yeah, I used to play checkers.
This is the set I used with him.

16:46.380 --> 16:47.464
With you.

16:49.800 --> 16:51.301
It's kind of old.

16:51.385 --> 16:52.886
It's old and really special
to me.

16:52.970 --> 16:55.222
There's nothing special
about old, Clare.

16:56.682 --> 16:58.267
Old is what happens
to new stuff,

16:58.267 --> 16:59.518
if you wait around long enough.

16:59.518 --> 17:01.145
- Please, gimme a lecture!
- HENRY, 28: Yeah, why not?

17:01.145 --> 17:02.771
Why not a lecture?

17:02.855 --> 17:04.857
'Cause you don't get it,
do you?

17:04.857 --> 17:08.485
You non-time travel people,
you don't ever, ever get it.

17:09.611 --> 17:11.405
You hang on to things
from the past,

17:11.405 --> 17:12.823
like the past matters any more.

17:12.823 --> 17:14.700
You-- you worry
about the future,

17:14.700 --> 17:18.037
and it's not even here yet,
when the only time is now.

17:19.204 --> 17:20.831
That's the only time
there ever is.

17:22.332 --> 17:23.417
Now.

17:25.210 --> 17:27.045
The past is what
didn't kill you,

17:28.338 --> 17:29.882
the future
is what definitely will,

17:29.882 --> 17:32.009
and in between
is the only thing that matters.

17:35.846 --> 17:36.847
You.

17:38.098 --> 17:39.141
You and me...

17:41.727 --> 17:42.728
right now.

17:45.355 --> 17:46.398
You and me...

17:47.649 --> 17:48.734
right now.

18:03.457 --> 18:05.334
Why does sex with you
always make me feel

18:05.334 --> 18:06.752
like I'm going to hell?

18:06.752 --> 18:08.170
I don't know...

18:08.170 --> 18:10.339
...but it is the single greatest
compliment I've ever been paid.

18:10.339 --> 18:11.673
Lock the door.

18:13.133 --> 18:15.511
Hey, Clare!
Put him down.

18:15.511 --> 18:17.429
Lunch in five.

18:18.806 --> 18:20.474
Okay, lunch.

18:20.474 --> 18:21.850
We're due at the table.

18:21.934 --> 18:25.854
Uh... sorry, I'm committed now.
Past the point of no return.

18:25.938 --> 18:27.648
Oh, no, come on.
You got to go back to your room.

18:27.648 --> 18:29.024
Freshen up.

18:29.608 --> 18:30.567
Freshen up.

18:30.651 --> 18:32.319
Is that what
they're calling it these days?

18:43.372 --> 18:44.373
Clare?

18:46.375 --> 18:49.169
- Oh, my God! You're here!
- Uh. Hello.

18:49.253 --> 18:51.296
I have missed you so much.

18:51.380 --> 18:53.215
Whoa! Looks at this! Tight!

18:53.215 --> 18:55.342
- Uh, who are you?
- Who am I?

18:55.342 --> 18:57.386
Oh, Henry,
I'm the love of your life,

18:57.386 --> 18:58.554
the woman you're going to marry.

18:58.554 --> 19:00.097
Oh, God, sorry!
I keep forgetting

19:00.097 --> 19:01.598
none of it's happened
for you yet.

19:01.682 --> 19:04.434
Time travel must
be so confusing! I'm Alicia.

19:04.518 --> 19:08.313
- Alicia? The sister?
- That's right, Henry, darling.

19:08.397 --> 19:10.357
Clare's sister. And yes...

19:10.357 --> 19:12.651
...you've been very busy
in this house.

19:13.986 --> 19:15.529
Got you some towels. You will
notice that they are blue.

19:15.529 --> 19:17.531
Now there's something blue
in the room. Happy?

19:17.531 --> 19:20.284
- I did not do, uh, anything--
- Oh, you guys have met then?

19:20.284 --> 19:22.244
Uh, yes.
But, I-- I--

19:22.244 --> 19:23.537
Are you fucking with Henry,
Alicia?

19:23.537 --> 19:24.872
Given half a chance.

19:24.872 --> 19:26.373
Don't fuck with my boyfriend, please.

19:26.373 --> 19:27.875
In any sense of that expression.

19:27.875 --> 19:29.418
Okay, if you say so, sis.

19:29.418 --> 19:31.670
Uh, could somebody explain,
basically, things.

19:31.670 --> 19:33.255
This is my younger sister, Alicia.

19:33.255 --> 19:35.215
- I realize that.
- Oh, she knows about you

19:35.299 --> 19:36.842
and I'm afraid she likes
to tease people.

19:36.842 --> 19:39.136
- No kidding.
- Yeah, sorry about that,

19:39.136 --> 19:41.346
but whoa, you made
some awesome faces.

19:41.430 --> 19:44.600
Mm-hmm. Uh, sorry, wait.
How does she know about me?

19:44.600 --> 19:46.268
- Oh, I told her.
- What? Why?

19:46.268 --> 19:48.186
- I saw you. A few times.
- CLARE, 20: Yeah.

19:48.270 --> 19:50.522
Sometimes, in the winter,
I'd have to bring you indoors.

19:50.606 --> 19:51.857
I mean, I hid you downstairs,

19:51.857 --> 19:54.318
but Alicia kept saying there
were naked men in the basement.

19:54.318 --> 19:55.777
So, I had to explain
to shut her up.

19:55.861 --> 19:57.571
What, you told her
I was a time traveler

19:57.571 --> 19:59.239
and you believed that?
The alternative

19:59.323 --> 20:01.241
was that my sister had found
a pipeline of naked men

20:01.325 --> 20:02.367
under the house.

20:02.451 --> 20:04.494
Time travel seemed
so disappointing by comparison,

20:04.578 --> 20:05.704
I thought it must be true.

20:05.704 --> 20:07.164
You look just like
the Henry in the drawing.

20:07.164 --> 20:08.999
HENRY, 28: The drawing?
Apart from the hair.

20:08.999 --> 20:10.584
This is better hair.
You shouldn't change that.

20:10.584 --> 20:12.377
- Uh, what drawing?
- You haven't seen the drawing?

20:12.461 --> 20:13.629
Oh, you gotta show him
the drawing.

20:13.629 --> 20:15.797
- Is it still in Chicago?
- No, actually, it's here.

20:15.881 --> 20:17.341
I don't want him finding it
at the apartment.

20:17.341 --> 20:19.134
- Why not? He'll love it.
- Exactly.

20:19.134 --> 20:20.469
Come on, we're due at the table.

20:20.469 --> 20:22.054
- You, freshen up
- Uh, you drew me?

20:22.054 --> 20:24.473
- You've got to see it!
- Come on.

20:24.473 --> 20:26.308
What are you doing?
Don't freak him out like that.

20:26.308 --> 20:28.101
I'm supposed to freak out
your boyfriends.

20:28.185 --> 20:29.978
It's my sacred duty
as your younger sister.

20:41.865 --> 20:43.283
- He's hot.
- Yeah, I know he's hot.

20:43.367 --> 20:45.160
- You never said he was hot.
- I didn't notice he was hot.

20:45.160 --> 20:47.621
- I was in love with him.
- You want to unpack that one?

20:47.621 --> 20:48.830
Cause I'm not sure
all the pieces

20:48.914 --> 20:49.957
will go back together.

20:54.503 --> 20:57.214
(GROANS, COUGHS) Fuck!

20:58.173 --> 20:59.091
Damn!

20:59.091 --> 21:00.926
Did I just land on top of you,
naked?

21:03.428 --> 21:04.471
Oh, God.

21:10.227 --> 21:13.105
I was a kid.
Now he's a kid.

21:13.105 --> 21:14.773
He's not a kid, Clare.

21:14.773 --> 21:16.358
I fell in love with a grown-up.

21:16.358 --> 21:18.193
And now he turns up
and he's all young.

21:18.193 --> 21:20.404
- Young and hot.
- But that's not the point.

21:21.947 --> 21:23.323
- Shit.
- What's wrong?

21:23.407 --> 21:24.491
The faucet.

21:49.641 --> 21:52.102
Son of a bitch!

21:54.980 --> 21:56.565
Oh, shitting, shitting fuck.

21:56.565 --> 21:58.358
I just think he's feeling
a little bit car sick.

21:58.442 --> 22:00.193
- That's all.
- Oh, poor thing.

22:00.277 --> 22:02.112
Well, you know, we can wait
a little for lunch then.

22:02.112 --> 22:04.573
Speak to Nell.
We push lunch an hour.

22:04.573 --> 22:06.533
- Is an hour enough?
- Uh, yeah.

22:06.533 --> 22:08.160
Yeah, no, I'm sure it will be.

22:08.160 --> 22:09.703
I hope he's feeling better soon.

22:09.703 --> 22:11.496
He will. He will. He'll be fine.

22:20.130 --> 22:21.506
You all right, dear?

22:21.590 --> 22:23.091
CLARE, 20: Yeah.

22:23.175 --> 22:24.801
How long has that been...

22:24.885 --> 22:26.344
Has it always been fake?

22:26.428 --> 22:28.638
Oh, yeah. We should have
put in a real one.

22:28.722 --> 22:30.807
We've been talking about that
ever since we bought the house,

22:30.891 --> 22:31.933
haven't we, Lucille?

22:32.017 --> 22:33.852
I always thought it was real.

22:33.852 --> 22:36.063

23:23.110 --> 23:24.653
Hey there, comrade.

23:24.653 --> 23:27.114
Welcome to the future.
It's 2022.

23:27.114 --> 23:29.074
Please disregard my hairline.

23:30.867 --> 23:34.037
You hang in there.
We'll get this all sorted.

23:36.748 --> 23:40.585
Right, now, to be clear,

23:41.503 --> 23:43.338
the footage from those cameras

23:43.338 --> 23:45.298
is uploading to a couple
of hard drives

23:45.382 --> 23:47.425
to which none of you
have any kind of access.

23:47.509 --> 23:49.886
Now, my law firm,
on the other hand,

23:49.970 --> 23:52.389
has already logged a request
to see tonight's footage.

23:52.389 --> 23:53.765
I had kind of a...

23:53.849 --> 23:56.143
an inkling something good
was going down.

23:56.143 --> 24:00.939
So, here is my advice.
My legal advice.

24:01.731 --> 24:04.109
Go the fuck home.

24:09.781 --> 24:12.242
- Hey, Nell.
- Oh, hey there, Clare.

24:12.242 --> 24:15.287
- Can you we push lunch an hour?
- Sure. Whatever you need.

24:15.287 --> 24:17.122
It's not gonna put you out?

24:17.122 --> 24:20.500
Put me out? No.
It's not putting me out.

24:20.584 --> 24:22.669
What would putting
me out matter?

24:24.462 --> 24:25.797
So, what did you think of him?

24:25.881 --> 24:27.924
Think of who, honey?
Your young man?

24:28.008 --> 24:29.050
Yeah.

24:30.010 --> 24:31.303
Well, he's pretty enough.

24:33.180 --> 24:35.432
Hey, is he rich?

24:37.392 --> 24:38.768
He has potential.

24:40.020 --> 24:43.231
They all got plenty of that.
Plenty of potential.

24:44.232 --> 24:47.027
Make sure he's rich,
that's my thinking.

24:47.027 --> 24:49.237
Or you're standing
at a kitchen sink

24:49.321 --> 24:50.530
the rest of your life.

24:52.532 --> 24:55.076
Hey, do you remember
my imaginary friend?

24:55.160 --> 24:58.038
The one I told you about.
I found him in the woods.

24:58.038 --> 25:00.207
That was you?
I thought that was Alicia.

25:00.207 --> 25:01.917
No, it was me.

25:01.917 --> 25:04.252
You two in here
all the time,

25:04.336 --> 25:07.964
chattering away.
I guess it all blurs together.

25:08.048 --> 25:11.092
I told Henry you were the one
I shared all my secrets with.

25:11.176 --> 25:12.844
I guess that was smart of you,

25:12.928 --> 25:14.846
since I don't remember
'em too good.

25:16.223 --> 25:17.641
Can I getcha a cup of tea?

25:18.558 --> 25:20.936
- No, I'm good.
- Some coffee?

25:20.936 --> 25:22.020
CLARE, 20: No, I'm good.

25:22.020 --> 25:23.313
You don't need
to make me anything.

25:23.313 --> 25:25.690
It's not a problem, hon.
It's what I'm paid for.

25:39.496 --> 25:40.747
You're pretty beat up,

25:40.747 --> 25:42.958
but you should get away
with it in a low light.

25:42.958 --> 25:44.251
Yeah.

25:44.251 --> 25:46.628
It'll get worse
when I time travel.

25:46.628 --> 25:47.837
I know, comrade.

25:49.965 --> 25:52.175
Why do you say that? "Comrade."

25:52.259 --> 25:55.303
I'm part Polish.
Well, my family is.

25:55.387 --> 25:56.721
And Poland used
to be communist, right,

25:56.805 --> 25:58.473
so they all used to call
each other comrade.

25:58.473 --> 26:00.141
And that's a reason
for us to do it?

26:01.935 --> 26:04.938
Well, you've never
questioned it till now.

26:04.938 --> 26:07.357
Now, for me, is 2008.
I've only just met you.

26:07.357 --> 26:11.194
2008. I forget,
do you like me yet?

26:11.278 --> 26:14.864
Do I ever like you?

26:16.491 --> 26:18.660
Ah, we've got something
in common at least.

26:19.661 --> 26:20.870
Oh, yeah? What's that?

26:23.123 --> 26:24.708
We're in love
with the same woman.

26:32.757 --> 26:34.509
You don't hide it very well,
you know that.

26:35.343 --> 26:37.220
Comrade.

26:37.304 --> 26:40.140
Way too obvious.
I mean, Clare knows, I know.

26:41.224 --> 26:43.059
Jesus, Charisse must have
noticed something.

26:43.935 --> 26:45.145
Does Charisse know?

26:48.857 --> 26:50.150
Yes.

26:51.484 --> 26:53.903
The answer is yes.

26:55.113 --> 26:56.781
I'm afraid you do like me.

27:05.165 --> 27:06.875
So, how am I doing in the...

27:06.875 --> 27:09.461
- well, whatever year is this?
- You're still around.

27:10.920 --> 27:12.505
Oh...

27:12.589 --> 27:14.758
Well, I figured
with my condition and all...

27:15.884 --> 27:17.469
not in it for the long haul.

27:19.596 --> 27:21.431
Can't see this working out
when I'm old.

27:21.431 --> 27:23.308
Yeah, well, you're still
around in 2022.

27:23.308 --> 27:26.895
Oh, yeah. Waiting till I'm not?
So you can swoop in,

27:26.895 --> 27:28.146
soon as I'm out the picture?

27:28.146 --> 27:30.607
I have a problem with you being
out of the picture,

27:30.607 --> 27:33.526
which is complicated
and kind of exhausting.

27:33.610 --> 27:34.819
HENRY, 28: What's that?

27:37.238 --> 27:38.365
It'll break my heart.

27:44.996 --> 27:48.833
We're best friends, Henry.
You'll learn to live with it.

27:51.169 --> 27:52.670
Or do you think
there's some other reason

27:52.754 --> 27:54.506
why I just saved your ass
by walking up

27:54.506 --> 27:56.007
to a bunch of psycho bikers

27:56.091 --> 27:57.759
and lying to them
about some cameras.

27:57.759 --> 27:59.803
There weren't any cameras?

27:59.803 --> 28:02.764
Ah. Of course there weren't
any fucking cameras.

28:10.980 --> 28:13.733
Shit.

28:14.526 --> 28:15.944
What?

28:18.029 --> 28:19.072
Thanks.

28:20.240 --> 28:23.535
- I do like you.
- I know.

28:23.535 --> 28:25.912
How can I like someone
who's hot for my future wife?

28:25.912 --> 28:28.623
Mm.
Because things change over time.

28:28.623 --> 28:32.710
For instance, these days,
I'm hot for your current wife.

28:37.924 --> 28:39.801
I'll tell you
what doesn't change though.

28:40.343 --> 28:41.386
What?

28:44.764 --> 28:45.890
I know it's hopeless.

28:48.435 --> 28:50.353
I've known
she was in love with you

28:50.437 --> 28:52.021
since before
I knew who you were,

28:52.105 --> 28:53.731
or even if you
were a real person.

28:55.692 --> 28:57.735
You're gonna have to explain
that one to me.

28:57.819 --> 29:00.780
I saw the drawing.
- What drawing?

29:00.864 --> 29:02.282
<i>The drawing Clare did of you.</i>

29:02.282 --> 29:03.908
HENRY, 28: <i>What,
you could tell from a drawing?</i>

29:03.992 --> 29:06.828
<i>Have you seen it yet?</i>

29:07.787 --> 29:10.623
<i>Face like yours,
drawing like that.</i>

29:12.417 --> 29:14.210
<i>I figured
she had to be in love.</i>

29:21.134 --> 29:24.012
Put your coffee down.

29:24.012 --> 29:27.140
Bruckner's,
21st of September, 2022.

29:27.140 --> 29:29.017
Seven thirty-two to 8:05 p.m.

29:29.017 --> 29:31.519
Make a note when you get home.

29:35.732 --> 29:36.733
Clare?

29:38.735 --> 29:40.653
I think I heard Henry.
I think he's back.

30:11.726 --> 30:13.811
Henry?

30:20.151 --> 30:21.319
Henry, are you back?

30:22.570 --> 30:24.614
Yeah, yeah, I'm-- I'm back.

30:25.281 --> 30:26.366
I'm okay.

30:27.450 --> 30:29.494
Where did you go?

30:30.078 --> 30:32.247
Uh, Gomez, a bar.

30:32.830 --> 30:33.873
It doesn't matter.

30:34.958 --> 30:36.167
How are we doing on lunch?

30:37.085 --> 30:38.253
Well, it's pretty much now.

30:38.253 --> 30:39.462
Do you want me
to say you're ill?

30:39.546 --> 30:42.131
No. No, no, I'm coming.
Just, uh...

30:44.175 --> 30:46.427
cover for me a bit, okay?

30:47.136 --> 30:48.263
Okay.

30:48.263 --> 30:50.848
I mean, go easy on me
for once, all right?

30:55.395 --> 30:56.771
Well, you go easy on me.

30:59.649 --> 31:02.235
HENRY, 28: Okay. Okay.

31:04.988 --> 31:06.072
I'll do my best.

31:07.282 --> 31:08.575
Yeah, you do that.

31:10.827 --> 31:11.953
Yeah, you too.

31:19.669 --> 31:21.754
Oh, fuck.

31:42.859 --> 31:43.943
Fuck.

31:48.406 --> 31:51.242
Smells lovely, doesn't it?

31:51.326 --> 31:54.037
Is anyone else enjoying
smelling the soup?

31:54.037 --> 31:56.247
Look, we can start.
Henry will be down in a moment.

31:56.331 --> 31:57.915
I think I'm starting
to inhale it.

31:58.541 --> 32:00.627
The level's going down.

32:00.627 --> 32:02.795
He's our guest, darling.
We don't mind waiting.

32:02.879 --> 32:04.339
Do you want me
to go look for him?

32:04.339 --> 32:05.840
Maybe he's trapped
under something heavy.

32:05.840 --> 32:07.091
Mark, stop it.

32:14.182 --> 32:16.517
Okay, listen. I'm just going
to be very honest, okay?

32:16.601 --> 32:18.269
Careful, there's family
at this table.

32:18.353 --> 32:19.312
Mark.

32:19.312 --> 32:21.856
Henry and I have been
sort of fighting.

32:21.856 --> 32:24.609
I mean, not really fighting,
just, you know--

32:24.609 --> 32:25.652
New relationship stuff.

32:25.652 --> 32:27.236
Yeah, exactly.
It's early stages, right?

32:27.320 --> 32:29.030
- Right,
- Well, I-- I see. So--

32:29.030 --> 32:31.199
He's gonna be down
in a minute, and, uh,

32:31.199 --> 32:33.701
you know, I'm just saying,
be nice.

32:33.785 --> 32:37.580
- Don't-- don't interrogate him.
- Of course not.

32:37.664 --> 32:40.166
- I'm talking to you, Dad.
- Me?

32:40.166 --> 32:41.542
No, of course, we'll be nice.

32:41.626 --> 32:43.002
We're excited
to get to know him.

32:43.086 --> 32:44.504
You were the one
doing the fighting.

32:44.504 --> 32:46.881
Well,
we weren't fighting exactly.

32:46.881 --> 32:48.049
It was just...

32:49.217 --> 32:51.386
He said some things
I didn't like very much.

32:51.386 --> 32:53.971
And, you know, maybe I got...

32:54.806 --> 32:56.307
a little bit too, um,

32:57.350 --> 32:59.519
I don't know, judgmental.

32:59.519 --> 33:01.979
HENRY, 28: Sorry!
Sorry, everyone.

33:02.063 --> 33:03.940
You should have started
without me.

33:03.940 --> 33:07.819
Wow.
Smells absolutely delicious.

33:08.945 --> 33:11.447
No. Uh. No.

33:13.574 --> 33:14.617
Oh, this.

33:14.701 --> 33:17.203
Yeah, well,
I don't have to tell you guys.

33:17.203 --> 33:20.331
Never disagree with Clare,
right?

33:20.415 --> 33:23.084
I didn't hit him.
Jesus! I didn't hit you.

33:23.084 --> 33:24.877
No, no, she definitely
didn't hit me.

33:24.961 --> 33:26.838
No, this was just general,
you know...

33:28.256 --> 33:29.507
Wear and tear?

33:32.009 --> 33:33.594
- I fell in the shower.
- He fell in the shower.

33:33.678 --> 33:35.763
Yeah, really badly.
Made a real mess of myself.

33:35.847 --> 33:37.348
Yeah, it was a bad fall.
It was very bad.

33:37.432 --> 33:39.308
Well, then why
didn't you say something?

33:39.392 --> 33:40.935
- I forgot.
- Forgot?

33:40.935 --> 33:43.771
Yeah, she forgot.
You know, because of the fight.

33:43.855 --> 33:45.565
Oh, we weren't fighting.
There was no fight at all.

33:45.565 --> 33:47.024
We never really fight,
do we, Clare?

33:47.108 --> 33:48.109
No, we were fighting,

33:48.109 --> 33:49.819
- I was just explaining.
- Okay.

33:49.819 --> 33:51.654
Mm-hmm. I was, uh,
being judgmental.

33:51.738 --> 33:53.448
Remember how
I was being judgmental?

33:53.448 --> 33:54.782
Yeah, Clare was just saying
about that.

33:54.866 --> 33:56.242
Yeah, I was just saying
that, uh,

33:56.242 --> 33:58.202
you know, that's why I felt bad.

33:58.286 --> 34:02.415
Because I forgot about the fall.

34:02.415 --> 34:03.833
Right. Of course.

34:03.833 --> 34:05.960
I mean, it wasn't really
a fight, just...

34:09.297 --> 34:11.174
So, Henry,
what about your parents?

34:11.174 --> 34:12.967
Clare hasn't really
mentioned them.

34:12.967 --> 34:15.636
Probably forgot.

34:15.720 --> 34:17.555
Uh, well, my dad plays violin

34:17.555 --> 34:19.724
for the, uh,
Chicago Philharmonic.

34:19.724 --> 34:21.601
Oh, my goodness,
that's amazing. Really?

34:21.601 --> 34:23.352
We've been
to the Chicago Philharmonic.

34:23.436 --> 34:24.645
- More than once.
- Yes, we must have

34:24.729 --> 34:25.688
seen your father then.

34:25.772 --> 34:27.231
Yeah. I guess
you would have. Yeah.

34:27.315 --> 34:29.442
Oh, that's so impressive.

34:29.442 --> 34:31.444
Is he, um, the first violinist?

34:31.444 --> 34:34.405
- No, just a violinist.
- And what about your mother?

34:35.823 --> 34:37.283
Uh, my mother died
when I was young.

34:37.283 --> 34:39.577
- Oh, dear, I'm so sorry.
- Yeah, she was a singer.

34:39.577 --> 34:40.953
Worked with my dad.

34:41.037 --> 34:43.539
His mom
was Annette Lyn Robinson.

34:43.623 --> 34:45.583
No! Really?

34:45.583 --> 34:48.169
- Really?
- Yeah. She was quite something.

34:48.169 --> 34:50.171
Oh, she was extraordinary.

34:50.171 --> 34:52.340
We actually have several
of her recordings here.

34:52.340 --> 34:54.175
You know who that is,
don't you, Philip?

34:54.175 --> 34:57.053
Yes, of course.
She was a remarkable performer.

34:57.053 --> 34:58.054
Remarkable woman.

34:58.054 --> 34:59.722
Well I thought so,
but she was my mom.

34:59.806 --> 35:01.557
But this-- this soup,
I mean, wow.

35:01.641 --> 35:04.352
It's, uh-- Smells delicious.
Sorry I delayed it all

35:04.352 --> 35:07.897
- by falling over like an idiot.
- You know, Alicia is a cellist.

35:07.897 --> 35:10.149
- I'm a hairdresser.
- Alicia plays the cello.

35:10.233 --> 35:11.317
It's always been her dream.

35:11.317 --> 35:13.528
No, I'm a hairdresser.
I like being a hairdresser.

35:14.403 --> 35:16.781
Excuse me, I have a question.

35:16.781 --> 35:19.575
You were late down here because
you fell over in the shower--

35:19.659 --> 35:21.118
I think
we've covered this, Mark.

35:22.745 --> 35:23.913
So, when did you have the fight?

35:23.913 --> 35:25.039
Does it matter?

35:25.123 --> 35:26.541
Well, you said
the fight made you forget

35:26.541 --> 35:29.418
about Henry hurting himself.
So it must have been after it,

35:29.502 --> 35:31.754
but I don't see
how there was time.

35:31.838 --> 35:34.382
We're not in court, Mark.
Are we in court right now?

35:36.676 --> 35:37.844
I don't do court work.

35:37.844 --> 35:39.554
I just don't see when
you could have had the fight.

35:39.554 --> 35:41.222
Well, we didn't have a fight.

35:41.222 --> 35:43.307
I was being judgmental,
that's all.

35:43.391 --> 35:45.893
A little bit critical.
Now leave it.

35:50.398 --> 35:52.233
Henry's father
could give you lessons.

35:52.233 --> 35:53.860
I'm sorry.
He's a violinist.

35:53.860 --> 35:55.570
He could teach you lessons,
don't you think?

35:55.570 --> 35:56.779
In hairdressing?
Does he do that?

35:56.863 --> 35:58.489
He could get you back
on track, Alicia.

35:58.573 --> 36:01.576
I am on track.
I'm doing something I'm good at.

36:01.576 --> 36:03.578
Why do you keep going on
about the cello which I sucked.

36:03.578 --> 36:06.205
Because a mother is allowed
to be proud of her daughter.

36:06.289 --> 36:08.040
The cellist and the artist.

36:08.124 --> 36:09.208
I'm an art student, Mom.

36:09.292 --> 36:10.793
That's not being proud,
that's being disappointed.

36:10.877 --> 36:12.503
It's not being disappointed
to know that a person

36:12.587 --> 36:14.130
- could do better.
- Yes it is.

36:14.714 --> 36:16.299
You're bleeding.

36:17.300 --> 36:18.301
Oh.

36:19.260 --> 36:21.262
Sorry about that. Yeah.

36:21.262 --> 36:24.098
Uh, thought I'd got all that.

36:27.018 --> 36:28.978
Don't worry,
I've, uh, cleaned up.

36:28.978 --> 36:30.271
All good as new.

36:33.149 --> 36:34.442
Okay.

36:35.443 --> 36:38.112
Just, uh, so I'm clear.

36:38.112 --> 36:40.656
You're lying there
on the bathroom floor,

36:40.740 --> 36:42.199
naked and bleeding,

36:42.283 --> 36:44.994
and somehow at this moment,
Clare becomes

36:44.994 --> 36:47.246
a bit too critical.

36:47.330 --> 36:49.749
And then she just leaves
you there,

36:49.749 --> 36:52.376
forgets the entire incident
but, nonetheless, has some

36:52.460 --> 36:56.923
vague memory that she might
have been a bit judgmental.

36:59.050 --> 37:01.594
- That about it.
- Fuck off.

37:02.762 --> 37:05.640
- Really. Just fuck the fuck off.
- Mm-hmm.

37:05.640 --> 37:07.433
CLARE, 20: You know what
I've had enough of?

37:07.433 --> 37:11.938
Everything! Mom,
your daughter is a hairdresser

37:11.938 --> 37:13.356
and she is perfectly happy
about it,

37:13.356 --> 37:15.441
and that is totally fine.

37:15.441 --> 37:17.526
Your other daughter
is an art student,

37:17.610 --> 37:19.070
which means she better get good
at bank robbery

37:19.070 --> 37:22.114
because sorry, everyone,
she's gonna marry a librarian.

37:22.198 --> 37:23.908
And your one and only son

37:23.908 --> 37:25.451
is a such
a total fucking asshole,

37:25.451 --> 37:27.995
he did the impossible
and became a lawyer

37:28.079 --> 37:29.914
without getting
noticeably worse.

37:29.914 --> 37:31.916
These are things
you have to deal with.

37:31.916 --> 37:33.501
Thank you for the fucking soup.

37:43.511 --> 37:44.512
Excuse me.

37:53.854 --> 37:55.189
Did she say marrying?

37:59.485 --> 38:00.486
Clare?

38:02.571 --> 38:03.948
Clare, you there?

38:03.948 --> 38:06.325
- Henry.
- Hey.

38:07.576 --> 38:10.329
It's okay.
There's a thing you can do.

38:22.133 --> 38:23.175
Shit.

38:24.635 --> 38:25.761
Where is she going?

38:29.265 --> 38:30.474
She's looking for me.

39:09.013 --> 39:10.056
CLARE, 34: <i>When you're young</i>

39:10.056 --> 39:11.557
<i>you see only what
you want to see.</i>

39:12.683 --> 39:15.061
<i>Nothing gets in the way
of the fairy tale.</i>

39:36.082 --> 39:39.460
<i>When you grow up,
your vision clears,</i>

39:39.460 --> 39:41.921
<i>and you see so much less.</i>

39:59.522 --> 40:03.818
They're all right, really,
my mom and dad. Even Mark.

40:04.860 --> 40:07.279
They're just, you know, people.

40:09.031 --> 40:10.950
Takes way to long
to realize that, doesn't it?

40:11.867 --> 40:13.327
Your mom and dad
are just people.

40:17.790 --> 40:20.793
She took it to Chicago with her,
when she was missing you.

40:25.756 --> 40:26.841
You know, if you'd asked me,

40:26.841 --> 40:28.884
I could have put some concealer
on those bruises.

40:31.262 --> 40:32.346
Can you help me?

40:33.764 --> 40:34.765
Help you what?

41:02.585 --> 41:03.627
HENRY, 28: Clare?

41:07.548 --> 41:09.300
Guess this place
means nothing to you.

41:11.802 --> 41:13.554
Don't you even get déjà vu?

41:17.141 --> 41:18.559
I was going make a big ceremony

41:18.559 --> 41:21.312
of bringing you out here
for the first time. Sorry.

41:22.813 --> 41:24.023
HENRY, 28: It doesn't matter.

41:26.108 --> 41:27.109
I'm here now.

41:28.569 --> 41:29.570
Yeah.

41:37.036 --> 41:38.078
I'm here now.

41:50.257 --> 41:52.635
So, what do you think?

41:54.011 --> 41:55.346
She's pretty good, your sister.

42:02.645 --> 42:05.189
Are you gonna tell me
what you think?

42:07.483 --> 42:09.401
CLARE, 12: I don't have
any friends called Henry.

42:09.485 --> 42:11.362
HENRY, 28: That's okay.
I promise you, I'm a friend.

42:11.362 --> 42:12.696
CLARE, 12:
Have you seen dinosaurs?

42:12.780 --> 42:14.406
I tickled
a dinosaur's tummy once.

42:14.490 --> 42:15.491
Do you have a wife?

42:15.491 --> 42:16.867
Funnily enough,
her name's Clare.

42:16.951 --> 42:18.077
- Like me.
- I'm gonna disappear.

42:18.077 --> 42:19.411
Can I watch?

42:19.495 --> 42:21.205
- CLARE, 12: <i>Are you coming back?</i>
- HENRY 32: <i>Yeah,</i>

42:21.205 --> 42:22.289
<i>I'll be back lots of times.</i>

42:22.373 --> 42:24.124
CLARE 13: <i>I have
stupid ideas sometimes.</i>

42:24.959 --> 42:26.293
And your wife's called Clare?

42:26.377 --> 42:27.461
I think you're married to me.

42:27.461 --> 42:29.255
HENRY, 32: <i>We're not married
in the future.</i>

42:31.048 --> 42:33.550
CLARE, 13: <i>You could be
out there somewhere, dying.</i>

42:33.634 --> 42:35.970
<i>- Somewhere in time.</i>
- Hello, Henry.

42:35.970 --> 42:37.221
<i>You've never kissed me,
you know.</i>

42:37.221 --> 42:39.181
Oh, I've kissed
you a million times.

42:39.265 --> 42:41.141
CLARE, 18:
<i>Why do I always have to wait?</i>

42:41.225 --> 42:42.142
Let it happen.

42:42.226 --> 42:43.477
You were asking me a question.

42:43.477 --> 42:44.728
HENRY, 41: <i>Clare Abshire...</i>

42:46.730 --> 42:47.856
will you marry me?

42:59.785 --> 43:02.538
You asked me a question
in this clearing once, or...

43:03.455 --> 43:04.581
you're going to.

43:05.749 --> 43:07.459
And I never got round
to answering.

43:08.836 --> 43:10.045
And what was the question?

43:10.129 --> 43:11.338
Well, the answer is yes.

43:12.881 --> 43:14.842
Yes. Oh, my God, yes.

43:15.926 --> 43:17.344
And I'm sorry.

43:17.428 --> 43:20.848
- For what?
- I loved you from the start.

43:20.848 --> 43:23.225
From the moment I met you
in that stupid library,

43:23.309 --> 43:25.185
I was completely
in love with you.

43:25.269 --> 43:27.271
I just expecting someone else.

43:28.022 --> 43:29.064
Well, that's okay.

43:30.065 --> 43:33.610
I can do that.
I can be somebody else.
