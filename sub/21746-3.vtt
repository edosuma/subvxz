00:50.966 --> 00:55.309
_

01:36.261 --> 01:37.621
Chief.

01:37.701 --> 01:38.861
Everything all right?

01:38.942 --> 01:40.701
- Sure, Chief.
- All right, all right.

01:41.383 --> 01:42.621
- Okay.
- Oh.

01:42.701 --> 01:43.813
Sure, Chief.

01:45.021 --> 01:46.181
You doing okay, Chief?

01:46.262 --> 01:47.381
Just open the fucking door.

01:47.462 --> 01:48.542
All right. Got it.

01:48.621 --> 01:50.261
And stop calling me fucking Chief.

01:59.067 --> 02:00.302
Anna?

02:26.817 --> 02:28.421
Where the fuck is my daughter?

02:30.782 --> 02:32.261
She's not in there with you, Chief?

02:34.420 --> 02:35.582
Where is she?

02:38.621 --> 02:40.341
- I don't know, Chief.
- You don't know.

02:40.421 --> 02:41.702
I don't know, I don't know. I, I...

02:41.781 --> 02:43.541
I was outside the whole time.
She didn't come out.

02:43.622 --> 02:45.541
- You were outside the whole time?
- Yes.

02:45.621 --> 02:47.821
Yeah. I mean, like,
I went to the washroom.

02:47.901 --> 02:49.141
So you weren't outside the whole time?

02:49.221 --> 02:50.461
I mean, I guess not, but...

02:51.941 --> 02:54.621
You find my fucking kid!

03:23.541 --> 03:25.581
Hey!

03:30.542 --> 03:32.261
- You all right?
- Drive.

03:49.341 --> 03:50.501
Fuck me.

03:50.582 --> 03:51.742
- Did you see the size of that?
- What was it?

03:51.821 --> 03:52.862
- I don't know.
- Oh, my God.

03:52.887 --> 03:53.876
Must've been about 10 foot!

03:53.901 --> 03:55.156
- You saw it?
- I don't know what I saw.

03:55.181 --> 03:56.942
- What did you see?
- I don't know! Did it growl?

03:56.967 --> 03:57.877
A bear?

03:57.902 --> 03:59.222
- We're in Canada.
- Fuck.

03:59.301 --> 04:01.261
Yeah, there's a bear sign. Right there.

04:01.341 --> 04:02.621
Oh!

04:07.262 --> 04:08.381
You all right?

04:09.923 --> 04:11.061
You're bleeding.

04:13.661 --> 04:14.702
Do you want to pull over?

04:14.727 --> 04:15.989
It's just a scratch.

04:16.742 --> 04:19.101
I got a first aid kit in
the back. We could stop.

04:19.127 --> 04:20.161
No.

04:22.862 --> 04:24.622
- Who are you calling?
- Dad.

04:25.061 --> 04:26.430
Where is he?

04:26.901 --> 04:28.181
I have no idea.

04:30.021 --> 04:32.741
Hi, this is Chief Worth.
Leave me a message. Thanks.

04:55.221 --> 04:57.781
Could... Could you drop me at Randy's?

04:58.682 --> 04:59.822
Randy's?

05:01.181 --> 05:02.381
Yeah, on Main Street.

05:02.406 --> 05:03.501
The bar?

05:05.942 --> 05:07.502
Why? Are you looking for someone?

05:19.262 --> 05:21.382
Where are you going?
You're going the wrong way.

05:21.461 --> 05:23.181
- Am I?
- Town's in the other direction.

05:23.261 --> 05:24.902
- Is it?
- Drop me here. I can walk back.

05:24.981 --> 05:26.542
What, with a bear on the loose?

05:41.702 --> 05:43.822
- He fucking hit me.
- Bigger picture.

05:43.901 --> 05:46.022
Bigger picture?
I could file an assault charge.

05:46.101 --> 05:47.341
There's a teenage girl gone missing.

05:47.421 --> 05:49.461
I was gone for two fucking minutes, D.

05:49.541 --> 05:50.901
What does this bed say to you?

05:53.222 --> 05:54.902
What do you mean,
what does the bed say to me?

05:54.981 --> 05:57.741
Which box do we tick?
Voluntary or involuntary.

05:57.821 --> 05:59.462
How the heck would I know?

05:59.541 --> 06:00.941
Does it say, teenage girl arranged bed

06:00.966 --> 06:02.022
to make it look like she was in it

06:02.102 --> 06:03.941
so she could sneak out
to meet boyfriend, or

06:04.022 --> 06:05.621
does it say, teenage girl
dragged out of bed...

06:05.702 --> 06:08.542
Oh, for fuck's sakes,
no one was dragged anywhere.

06:08.621 --> 06:10.502
I took a lousy piss and this...

06:11.861 --> 06:13.288
Did you try calling her, Chief?

06:13.313 --> 06:14.433
Straight to voice mail.

06:16.022 --> 06:17.182
Have you seen my mobile?

06:17.261 --> 06:18.381
We're gonna get this sorted.

06:18.422 --> 06:20.501
We have a few hikers
go missing each year.

06:22.061 --> 06:23.861
- Where's Lehane?
- He's on his way.

06:23.942 --> 06:25.582
No sign of forced entry.

06:25.821 --> 06:27.702
Yeah, well, doesn't rule out
abduction, does it?

06:28.221 --> 06:29.621
Abduction, Denise?

06:29.861 --> 06:31.661
I would have heard something.
A struggle, a scream...

06:31.742 --> 06:33.101
You abandoned your post.

07:05.702 --> 07:07.181
Randy's, you want to go to?

07:07.941 --> 07:10.781
All right, I'll turn round.
It's no worries.

07:39.381 --> 07:40.941
The name's Whitey, by the way.

07:42.339 --> 07:43.661
You're English.

07:43.995 --> 07:45.221
So are you.

07:47.181 --> 07:48.981
There's a ton of us out here
for the refinery.

07:49.097 --> 07:50.261
What about you?

07:50.342 --> 07:51.782
Oh, my God, it's you.

07:52.701 --> 07:55.861
The body-popper.

07:57.868 --> 07:59.021
That was, um...

07:59.901 --> 08:02.181
- There's no words for it.
- ...amazingly weird.

08:16.821 --> 08:18.422
She's probably gone to see her mum.

08:19.901 --> 08:21.261
Then why'd she sneak out the back?

08:21.302 --> 08:23.582
Because I stuck your idiot
fucking boyfriend on the door

08:23.661 --> 08:24.901
to stop her doing something
stupid like that.

08:24.981 --> 08:26.702
He's not my boyfriend.

08:30.221 --> 08:32.501
From now on, you get to drive
the fucking golf cart.

09:03.341 --> 09:04.742
Where is Anna?

09:15.855 --> 09:16.901
She...

09:16.982 --> 09:19.622
She's having trouble sleeping,
so I let her have a lie in.

09:30.381 --> 09:31.421
Who are you?

09:32.982 --> 09:34.021
What?

09:36.662 --> 09:38.062
Who are you?

09:42.701 --> 09:44.302
I'm your husband.

09:46.301 --> 09:47.621
Which one?

09:53.781 --> 09:55.061
I miss him.

10:10.862 --> 10:11.981
Jack.

10:17.702 --> 10:19.502
You haven't called me that in a while.

10:39.302 --> 10:41.582
Ah, you're hurting me, love.

10:54.381 --> 10:56.221
Where's Anna? I want to see her.

11:10.341 --> 11:11.821
Boyfriend getting shit-faced, is he?

11:12.221 --> 11:13.262
It's Dad.

11:14.901 --> 11:16.421
At least I think he is.

11:21.662 --> 11:23.021
I'm sorry to hear it.

11:28.181 --> 11:31.982
Thanks for... Rescuing me.

11:33.101 --> 11:34.301
Any time.

11:51.701 --> 11:53.741
How come I get to drive this shit-heap?

11:54.902 --> 11:56.542
And the kid drives
the fancy wheels, huh?

11:57.941 --> 11:59.462
I'm not made of money.

12:00.782 --> 12:02.182
Where the fuck is he?

12:03.422 --> 12:05.462
In Randy's, getting rat-arsed.
You got the bag?

12:05.541 --> 12:06.621
It's complicated.

12:06.902 --> 12:07.902
I don't like complicated.

12:08.421 --> 12:10.541
Well, I can't just grab it
off her, can I, Frank?

12:10.622 --> 12:11.622
Then she'd know.

12:12.302 --> 12:13.781
I've got to act natural.

12:14.105 --> 12:15.341
<i>Wait till she ain't looking,</i>

12:15.422 --> 12:17.381
<i>then get it off her
without her noticing.</i>

12:17.462 --> 12:19.581
- How long's that gonna take?
- Blame Johnny,

12:19.661 --> 12:20.861
<i>and count yourself lucky you've got me</i>

12:20.942 --> 12:22.142
<i>to clean up after his mess.</i>

12:27.341 --> 12:29.021
So what if she found a cigarette butt?

12:29.661 --> 12:30.901
What does that fucking prove?

12:33.062 --> 12:34.582
It's got your DNA all over it.

12:35.702 --> 12:36.782
I got no motive.

12:37.142 --> 12:38.142
Well, maybe not,

12:38.462 --> 12:39.462
but I do.

12:39.741 --> 12:40.781
I'm your only alibi.

12:45.021 --> 12:46.061
Fucking little bitch.

13:43.461 --> 13:44.621
Lehane has your cell.

13:46.221 --> 13:48.501
- What?
- Randy just handed it in.

13:53.942 --> 13:55.982
- What?
- You were at the bar last night.

13:59.272 --> 14:00.422
So?

14:00.501 --> 14:02.741
So Lehane says that your phone
is full of texts from Anna

14:02.781 --> 14:04.861
wondering where the hell
you were. Where were you?

14:05.222 --> 14:06.902
- Is this a fucking interview?
- It can be.

14:09.062 --> 14:10.062
Wait here.

14:46.301 --> 14:47.301
Fuck.

14:47.661 --> 14:48.661
Oh.

14:49.221 --> 14:50.221
Fuck.

14:52.262 --> 14:54.622
Holy shit la marde,

14:54.941 --> 14:57.581
he just remembered that he's married.

14:58.461 --> 14:59.461
Fuck.

15:02.501 --> 15:04.061
Where are we?

15:06.261 --> 15:09.381
What's wrong?
We were just having some fun.

15:10.181 --> 15:11.181
Come on.

15:12.221 --> 15:14.381
You'd better remember
my name, motherfucker.

15:14.541 --> 15:15.581
Where am I?

15:16.781 --> 15:18.341
- The res.
- What?

15:18.422 --> 15:19.422
The reserve.

15:25.941 --> 15:26.941
Where's my gun?

15:28.142 --> 15:29.142
Eh?

15:30.261 --> 15:31.261
Mmm.

15:31.502 --> 15:33.502
What happened to that guy
I brought back here last night?

15:33.581 --> 15:34.781
The little firecracker.

15:34.862 --> 15:36.221
Where's my fucking gun?

15:39.101 --> 15:40.101
Eh?

15:41.781 --> 15:43.621
Do you think I'm a whore?

15:45.141 --> 15:49.421
My name is Jaclyn, you goddamn
fucking son of a bitch.

15:49.862 --> 15:52.262
And you said you were going to help me.

15:53.621 --> 15:54.662
Help you?

15:55.901 --> 15:56.901
Don't you remember?

15:56.981 --> 15:59.342
Last night you told me
you were going to help...

16:01.262 --> 16:02.262
Holy shit.

16:08.021 --> 16:09.141
Fuck off.

17:05.821 --> 17:06.862
Anna.

17:18.061 --> 17:20.061
Jesus fucking Christ!

17:20.381 --> 17:21.381
Fuck.

17:43.301 --> 17:44.661
Where's Anna? I want to see her.

17:47.021 --> 17:48.062
So, where were you?

17:59.541 --> 18:00.541
Hey, baby.

18:01.982 --> 18:03.022
Cunted, was he?

18:04.181 --> 18:05.181
Your dad?

18:07.982 --> 18:09.382
Yeah, he's an alcoholic.

18:10.301 --> 18:11.541
How long since the last bender?

18:12.981 --> 18:13.981
Three years.

18:14.061 --> 18:15.061
Twelve steps?

18:16.742 --> 18:18.622
Fat lot of good.

18:20.102 --> 18:21.662
We came here to make a new start.

18:24.141 --> 18:25.902
He stopped for
my little brother, but then...

18:30.341 --> 18:32.301
And now I suppose I'm not enough.

18:32.702 --> 18:34.222
My mum always used to say,

18:34.461 --> 18:36.821
"A sober alcoholic
wouldn't give her son away

18:36.902 --> 18:38.302
"for all the whiskey in the world,

18:38.381 --> 18:39.741
"but give her one drink

18:39.821 --> 18:41.501
"and she'd sell him for the next glass."

18:43.941 --> 18:45.101
Your mum was an alcoholic?

18:45.501 --> 18:46.741
Always was, always will be.

18:48.422 --> 18:49.622
What's left of her.

18:51.182 --> 18:53.261
Point is, we can't trust 'em.

18:54.701 --> 18:55.742
Much as we love 'em.

18:58.581 --> 18:59.901
Why don't I take you home?

19:01.821 --> 19:03.461
Home's 6,000 miles away.

19:04.581 --> 19:05.981
Anywhere you wanna go then.

19:08.102 --> 19:09.262
I don't care.

19:22.382 --> 19:23.502
What the fuck are you doing?

19:24.741 --> 19:25.861
Follow me.

19:29.462 --> 19:30.462
Let's go.

20:06.422 --> 20:08.422
"Fuck you." Sent at 2:21 a.m.

20:09.461 --> 20:10.901
Last missed call was...

20:11.621 --> 20:15.741
Let's see. She made
about six in total at 2:20.

20:19.101 --> 20:20.781
Why's she texting, "Where are you?"

20:27.062 --> 20:28.502
I went out for a beer.

20:29.421 --> 20:31.101
- When did you get back?
- Don't know.

20:31.262 --> 20:32.462
Constable McGillen said that

20:32.541 --> 20:34.021
you got back at the hotel after 6:00.

20:34.061 --> 20:35.421
Constable McGillen is a cunt.

20:36.701 --> 20:39.302
You have no idea where you were
between the hours of 3:00,

20:39.381 --> 20:40.781
when you were seen leaving Randy's,

20:40.821 --> 20:42.061
and 6:00, when you got back
to the hotel?

20:42.141 --> 20:44.302
My daughter has been missing
since midnight last night.

20:44.541 --> 20:46.381
So you can't verify your whereabouts?

20:46.541 --> 20:47.541
I was blind drunk.

20:48.261 --> 20:49.621
Could she be trying to punish you?

20:49.742 --> 20:51.302
Maybe staying with
a girlfriend or something?

20:51.422 --> 20:52.582
She doesn't have any friends.

20:54.621 --> 20:55.861
We forced her to come here.

21:02.061 --> 21:03.181
I got a splitting headache.

21:08.822 --> 21:09.941
Will you help me find her?

21:10.022 --> 21:11.542
Nick, painkillers.

21:12.302 --> 21:13.502
What am I, a pharmacist now?

21:17.781 --> 21:20.500
I can't get E Section's air support
or any other resources

21:20.582 --> 21:22.462
until she's been missing for 24 hours.

21:22.581 --> 21:23.901
My son was murdered.

21:26.661 --> 21:28.701
We're gonna need
your computer as evidence and

21:28.781 --> 21:30.582
I need you to sign off
on these medical forms.

21:38.102 --> 21:39.102
Are we done?

21:45.261 --> 21:46.501
Is he fit for duty?

21:47.301 --> 21:48.301
Would you be?

22:32.342 --> 22:33.821
Two can play at Dad's game.

22:41.141 --> 22:43.742
Why should I be the only one
who isn't in a fucking coma?

22:45.182 --> 22:46.582
I'm not letting anyone down.

22:49.862 --> 22:51.542
Why is this happening to us?

22:53.462 --> 22:56.381
A few days ago
we were a nice, normal family.

22:56.462 --> 22:58.342
Hmm. With a dad like yours?

22:59.861 --> 23:01.781
An alkie, I mean.

23:05.822 --> 23:07.382
None of this is your fault.

23:08.501 --> 23:11.061
I used to think
if my mum loved me, she'd stop.

23:16.221 --> 23:17.381
She didn't.

23:21.902 --> 23:23.222
What happened to her?

23:23.301 --> 23:24.421
She's in a home.

23:24.782 --> 23:25.982
Bloody nice one, mind.

23:26.462 --> 23:28.622
Costs an arm and a leg.
That's why I'm here.

23:29.901 --> 23:31.741
You can earn a packet
as a vac truck driver,

23:32.261 --> 23:35.061
doing the 12-hour shifts plus overtime.

23:35.861 --> 23:37.581
Yeah, I hope she's grateful.

23:37.742 --> 23:38.981
She loves me in her own way.

24:14.301 --> 24:15.821
Can I have your attention, please?

24:15.902 --> 24:17.182
Is this on? Can you get this on?

24:17.301 --> 24:19.421
Can I have your attention, please?

24:21.381 --> 24:24.861
Four days ago, an unidentified
gunman shot and killed my son,

24:25.341 --> 24:27.581
and now my daughter is missing.
I need some volunteers.

24:33.341 --> 24:34.982
Anyone willing to help look for her?

24:36.302 --> 24:37.302
Thanks.

24:37.862 --> 24:38.862
Anybody?

24:41.141 --> 24:42.941
Oh. Chief.

24:44.061 --> 24:46.461
Come here. These guys are just
workers, they don't give a shit.

24:46.541 --> 24:47.741
You want me to round up some volunteers,

24:47.822 --> 24:48.822
you just say the word.

24:49.181 --> 24:50.262
- All right, thanks.
- Okay.

24:50.301 --> 24:52.341
Unconfirmed reports of two trespassers

24:52.421 --> 24:53.621
near the municipal dam.

24:53.702 --> 24:56.782
Caucasian. One male, one female.
Girl's in her teens.

24:58.101 --> 24:59.261
Dam is on the reserve, Chief.

24:59.301 --> 25:01.541
The police can't go on the
reserve without an invitation.

25:09.941 --> 25:11.462
Hey, guys, line up over here.

25:11.541 --> 25:13.221
What the hell are you doing?

25:14.222 --> 25:15.422
Assembling volunteers.

25:15.501 --> 25:16.501
Why?

25:16.941 --> 25:18.181
A girl's gone missing.

25:18.662 --> 25:20.342
We have an operation to run.

25:20.981 --> 25:24.381
It is not inconceivable that one
of our employees is responsible

25:24.461 --> 25:25.742
for a missing teenage girl.

25:26.381 --> 25:27.741
It is unpleasant,

25:27.821 --> 25:29.702
but the more proactive
we are, the better.

25:29.781 --> 25:31.501
I didn't authorize this.

25:32.822 --> 25:34.382
Are we a team, Monsieur Gagnon?

25:35.301 --> 25:37.261
- A team?
- A team.

25:37.341 --> 25:39.541
You know, working together
for a common goal.

25:40.022 --> 25:43.781
My goal is to get
this refinery operational.

25:43.862 --> 25:45.422
Yours is to assist me.

25:46.781 --> 25:49.061
Anything else is a complication.

26:11.421 --> 26:12.661
Them others,

26:12.741 --> 26:15.221
them oil boys,
like the scum outside Randy's,

26:15.302 --> 26:16.702
they got no reason to live.

26:17.222 --> 26:18.782
They're stomachs on legs.

26:19.142 --> 26:22.342
I can see it in their eyes.
They're empty.

26:23.621 --> 26:24.902
But not me.

26:25.821 --> 26:26.821
I got a purpose.

26:29.781 --> 26:30.821
I got a purpose.

27:00.941 --> 27:01.941
Sorry.

27:01.982 --> 27:03.422
I think you drunk too much.

27:04.101 --> 27:05.461
Maybe you should sleep it off.

27:05.861 --> 27:07.982
I wish I didn't feel sick.

27:09.182 --> 27:10.262
The car's spinning.

27:12.821 --> 27:13.821
That's it.

27:18.422 --> 27:19.462
Shut your eyes.

27:24.741 --> 27:26.061
I want to go for a walk.

27:41.222 --> 27:42.462
Nice spot for a stroll.

27:43.181 --> 27:44.222
It's perfect.

28:11.861 --> 28:13.421
It's beautiful.

28:16.581 --> 28:17.581
It's locked.

28:18.422 --> 28:19.422
So?

28:46.901 --> 28:47.901
There he is.

29:16.142 --> 29:17.462
I wanna go higher.

29:17.981 --> 29:19.142
Ain't we high enough?

29:19.262 --> 29:21.062
No.

29:21.782 --> 29:22.782
Woo!

29:30.302 --> 29:31.541
The moon's still up.

29:32.781 --> 29:34.381
Makes you feel so lonely, don't it?

29:35.981 --> 29:37.341
Which I think is a bloody waste.

29:38.741 --> 29:39.941
I mean, there's what?

29:40.022 --> 29:41.942
Gazillions of empty planets
up there, right?

29:42.221 --> 29:43.221
Right.

29:43.301 --> 29:44.702
So, what's the fucking point?

29:45.821 --> 29:46.821
Nothing has a point.

29:47.222 --> 29:48.222
Bollocks.

29:49.461 --> 29:50.781
Everything has an agenda.

29:52.341 --> 29:53.341
Everything

29:53.901 --> 29:54.941
and everyone...

29:55.581 --> 29:56.741
has a purpose.

29:58.382 --> 29:59.822
What's your purpose, Whitey?

29:59.901 --> 30:00.981
I already told you.

30:02.541 --> 30:03.821
You're here to support your mum?

30:03.861 --> 30:04.861
Yeah.

30:04.901 --> 30:05.901
Bollocks.

30:06.221 --> 30:07.301
Believe what you want.

30:07.581 --> 30:08.781
No one's that nice.

30:09.221 --> 30:10.382
How would you know?

30:11.381 --> 30:12.541
You don't know what happened.

30:12.821 --> 30:14.022
Tell me what happened.

30:15.861 --> 30:16.861
When someone dies,

30:18.261 --> 30:19.261
someone you love,

30:21.141 --> 30:22.661
you sort of breathe death in,

30:23.981 --> 30:24.981
like germs.

30:32.261 --> 30:33.461
If I said jump, would you?

30:33.662 --> 30:34.781
Fuck off.

30:35.342 --> 30:36.382
You serious?

30:41.661 --> 30:43.030
I don't think we should go any higher.

30:43.055 --> 30:44.077
Why not?

30:44.116 --> 30:46.942
'Cause I fucking hate heights,
that's why.

30:47.021 --> 30:49.421
I don't. I'm not afraid of anything now.

30:49.982 --> 30:51.142
Not with you here.

31:19.181 --> 31:20.181
What now?

31:20.301 --> 31:22.141
That's the Elder's Lodge.
They're watching us.

31:22.382 --> 31:23.382
So?

31:23.741 --> 31:25.581
You cross this bridge,
they're gonna shoot you.

31:27.861 --> 31:29.981
I haven't got time to pass
a fucking peace pipe, love.

31:30.021 --> 31:32.061
Have some respect, okay?
There's history here.

31:32.141 --> 31:33.621
You're the one who just
got off the fucking boat.

31:33.701 --> 31:34.742
Remember that.

31:34.821 --> 31:36.861
You stay here, okay?
I'm gonna talk to them.

32:16.901 --> 32:18.261
The hell kind of man is he?

32:18.302 --> 32:20.542
He's a good man, okay?
He loves his family.

32:22.461 --> 32:24.262
If you hadn't lost touch
with your own people,

32:24.302 --> 32:25.982
- you'd know by now.
- Know what?

32:26.061 --> 32:27.501
The kind of man you're dealing with.

32:34.382 --> 32:35.501
Yeah, bring her out.

32:51.941 --> 32:53.102
Oh, fuck.

33:03.581 --> 33:05.702
Okay, he shouldn't
have done what you say he did,

33:05.781 --> 33:07.461
but he just lost his son.

33:07.862 --> 33:09.542
You don't have to punish him like this.

33:09.662 --> 33:12.422
Lawmen been fucking us for centuries.

33:12.861 --> 33:14.142
You think I'm doing this because

33:14.222 --> 33:16.342
a white cop fucked one of my people?

33:19.821 --> 33:21.541
I'm doing this
because you're my daughter

33:22.022 --> 33:23.822
and you call this man Chief.

33:47.781 --> 33:49.101
This is Chief Minahik.

33:50.541 --> 33:53.221
By what authority
are you entering treaty land?

33:54.902 --> 33:56.062
And by what authority

33:56.141 --> 33:58.661
did you enter our reserve
a few hours ago?

34:01.502 --> 34:03.982
You trespassed onto our land
without invitation,

34:04.262 --> 34:06.422
provocation or legal reason,

34:07.421 --> 34:09.661
in a state of intoxication.

34:09.860 --> 34:13.661
Unfit for duty,
yet carrying a lethal weapon.

34:17.781 --> 34:21.181
Consider this your warning.
Your first and last.

34:25.341 --> 34:27.380
Just trying to find my daughter.

34:29.301 --> 34:30.860
Take your gun and turn back.

35:07.101 --> 35:08.741
Clear the crowd
and get me airborne, now.

35:27.141 --> 35:28.141
You okay?

35:37.901 --> 35:40.221
When I drink, I black out,
all right, so...

35:41.061 --> 35:42.461
You asked me what I did last night,

35:42.501 --> 35:44.101
I've absolutely no fucking idea.

35:47.741 --> 35:48.941
Help me find my girl.

35:53.702 --> 35:54.821
Do something!

35:56.462 --> 35:57.462
Dad!

35:58.061 --> 35:59.222
Do something!

36:23.381 --> 36:25.341
Petey used to make these little models,

36:25.421 --> 36:26.621
leave them by my bedside.

36:28.181 --> 36:29.222
I never knew what the hell they were.

36:29.301 --> 36:32.141
They all looked like demented snowmen.

36:35.661 --> 36:37.901
It has this horrible smell. Smell it.

36:38.981 --> 36:39.981
Fuck.

36:41.942 --> 36:43.022
It dries out,

36:44.181 --> 36:45.541
then it starts to crumble.

36:47.942 --> 36:48.942
Look.

36:49.622 --> 36:51.461
My little brother's crumbling to dust.

37:07.581 --> 37:08.941
Whitey, I just remembered.

37:09.501 --> 37:10.501
What?

37:10.781 --> 37:12.782
That bloke, you know,

37:12.861 --> 37:14.781
you know, the one who won
the karaoke contest?

37:15.832 --> 37:16.862
Yeah.

37:16.941 --> 37:19.421
He was down by the river the day
before Petey was murdered.

37:20.027 --> 37:21.301
He what?

37:21.381 --> 37:22.741
I remember thinking
it was weird at the time.

37:22.821 --> 37:25.061
Like he was sort of watching the house.

37:25.142 --> 37:26.542
- You sure it was the same bloke?
- I'm dead sure.

37:26.621 --> 37:27.701
Have you told anyone?

37:27.782 --> 37:30.101
I should have told Dad.
Not that he cares.

37:30.182 --> 37:32.656
If he gave a shit about us, he wouldn't
be out getting pissed, would he?

37:33.023 --> 37:34.582
He doesn't care, so why should I?

37:36.381 --> 37:37.821
What's the bloody point, anyway?

37:39.621 --> 37:40.621
There's nothing left.

37:46.661 --> 37:47.781
Nothing left to stop me.

37:48.782 --> 37:49.982
Stop you what?

37:50.061 --> 37:52.741
I could just lean forward
and it would all be over.

38:02.741 --> 38:03.741
My bag!

38:06.101 --> 38:07.421
Petey's things.

38:07.502 --> 38:08.902
You going to go in after it?

38:10.781 --> 38:12.021
You think I won't?

38:34.022 --> 38:35.582
What the fuck is he playing at?

38:37.421 --> 38:38.462
He's going to kill her.

38:39.461 --> 38:40.461
Give it here.

38:50.901 --> 38:51.901
Push me.

38:55.262 --> 38:56.262
Please.

39:01.941 --> 39:02.941
I can't.

39:04.262 --> 39:05.342
Give me the gun.

39:07.382 --> 39:08.902
If he hasn't got the balls to do it,

39:10.262 --> 39:11.501
then someone else has to.

39:11.942 --> 39:12.942
All right.

39:14.781 --> 39:16.141
None of this is your fault.

39:16.221 --> 39:17.381
- Let me go.
- No.

39:36.182 --> 39:37.182
We have company.

39:37.262 --> 39:39.341
Right, we gotta get out of here. Now.

39:41.421 --> 39:42.421
Leave it!

39:45.261 --> 39:46.941
Get... Please.

40:57.101 --> 40:58.341
You swore.

40:58.421 --> 41:00.581
- You swore on my life, you fucking cunt.
- I know, I'm sorry.

41:00.662 --> 41:01.822
No, get away from me.

41:21.542 --> 41:24.662
Stick a copy of this front page
on our website

41:24.741 --> 41:26.101
and issue a press release.

41:26.181 --> 41:27.181
