00:06.840 --> 00:07.630
Listen.

00:09.050 --> 00:11.100
Ms. Travis, listen to me.

00:11.530 --> 00:12.470
What?

00:12.530 --> 00:14.000
This is a simple surgery.

00:14.070 --> 00:16.170
I've done this operation hundreds of times.

00:16.239 --> 00:17.570
You'll be fine.

00:17.640 --> 00:19.570
But what if I'm not fine?

00:19.640 --> 00:21.940
What if I die on that operating table?

00:22.010 --> 00:25.010
- I have three... 
- Uh-huh.

00:25.080 --> 00:26.510
- I have three...
- Uh-huh, uh-huh.

00:26.580 --> 00:28.080
I have three children.

00:28.150 --> 00:29.550
Oh, I'm sorry, kids.

00:29.620 --> 00:31.650
Excuse me.

00:31.650 --> 00:34.660
I don't mean to interrupt
the scene, but Tori,

00:34.720 --> 00:38.990
look at the red dot I
drew on this index card.

00:39.060 --> 00:39.860
Boo!

00:42.060 --> 00:43.200
Sikowitz!

00:43.260 --> 00:46.400
You scared the Fudge outta me.

00:46.470 --> 00:48.800
Why did you stop crying?

00:48.870 --> 00:49.840
What?!

00:49.900 --> 00:52.140
You were playing the role of a
crying woman who's just been told

00:52.210 --> 00:53.940
she's going to have surgery.

00:54.010 --> 00:56.410
Why did you break character?

00:56.480 --> 01:00.880
'Cuz you interrupted our scene
and screamed boo in my face!

01:00.950 --> 01:04.720
Tori and Andre, take your seats.

01:04.790 --> 01:08.860
I'm trying to teach you kids about
method acting, and that means

01:08.920 --> 01:10.360
whatever character you're playing,

01:10.430 --> 01:13.660
you must stay in that
character, the entire time,

01:13.730 --> 01:15.230
no matter what happens.

01:15.300 --> 01:18.430
Whether on camera or off
camera, on stage or off stage,

01:18.500 --> 01:20.400
you've got to understand that...

01:22.940 --> 01:33.250
Until tomorrow.

01:33.310 --> 01:35.250
Look, I'm sorry we disappointed you.

01:35.320 --> 01:38.750
Yeah, it's just that we think
that method acting is kinda dumb.

01:38.820 --> 01:40.050
Yeah.

01:40.120 --> 01:42.660
Well, of course you think
method acting is dumb.

01:42.720 --> 01:45.730
It's too challenging for you.

01:45.790 --> 01:48.660
Yeah, I really don't think
that's the issue here.

01:48.730 --> 01:51.100
Staying in character no matter what happens

01:51.170 --> 01:56.440
is something only true,
professional actors can pull off.

01:56.500 --> 02:04.580
Sometimes I forget you're all just
children, you know, amateurs.

02:04.650 --> 02:06.110
He called us amateurs.

02:06.180 --> 02:09.949
Your whack-job teacher
just called all y'all out!

02:10.020 --> 02:11.490
I love it.

02:11.550 --> 02:12.820
Aw, I'm sorry.

02:12.890 --> 02:16.790
I didn't mean to hurt your
little amateur feelings.

02:16.860 --> 02:18.690
He did it again.

02:18.760 --> 02:21.830
I really don't think method
acting is all that hard.

02:21.900 --> 02:26.370
Then I issue a challenge.

02:26.430 --> 02:27.600
What kinda challenge?

02:27.670 --> 02:29.940
Who wants to have a sleepover at my house?

02:30.000 --> 02:34.070
I do.

02:34.140 --> 02:35.410
Oh, come on.

02:35.480 --> 02:38.610
You guys don't wanna see
where this lunatic lives?

02:38.680 --> 02:40.580
No offense.

02:40.650 --> 02:41.850
It's all right, Jade.

02:41.920 --> 02:49.060
I savor your bitterness like
a sweet, rancid cream sauce.

02:49.120 --> 02:50.660
So what's the plan?

02:50.730 --> 02:54.490
All of you will show up at my
house on Friday night at 7 P.M.

02:54.560 --> 02:57.360
Each of you will be playing
a distinct character,

02:57.430 --> 03:01.270
and you must stay in your
character until Saturday morning.

03:01.340 --> 03:02.440
And what happens if we break?

03:02.500 --> 03:05.970
You'll be immediately
banished from my home.

03:06.040 --> 03:09.080
So who picks the characters we play?

03:09.140 --> 03:10.280
Beck, you'll choose for Cat.

03:10.340 --> 03:11.280
Cat will choose for Robbie.

03:11.350 --> 03:12.210
Robbie will choose for Beck.

03:12.280 --> 03:13.210
Andre will choose for Tori.

03:13.280 --> 03:14.210
Tori will choose for Jade.

03:14.280 --> 03:16.450
Jade, you'll choose for Andre.

03:16.520 --> 03:22.390
I think that deserves some applause.

03:22.460 --> 03:25.230
We'll meet in the black box
theater after school to hear

03:25.290 --> 03:27.830
who's playing what.

03:27.900 --> 03:28.860
Hey, Tori.

03:28.930 --> 03:30.460
Maybe you should play a
woman who loves to make out

03:30.530 --> 03:40.770
with two-foot tall guys
who happen to be me.

03:40.840 --> 03:43.080
Is that what you wanted?

03:43.140 --> 03:44.280

04:56.450 --> 05:00.850
What role will Cat be playing at
the great sikowitz sleepover?

05:00.920 --> 05:08.190
Cat will play a 198os standup
comedian who's very annoying.

05:08.260 --> 05:10.200
I wanna be a unicorn.

05:10.260 --> 05:11.360
You can't.

05:11.430 --> 05:13.530
Phooey.

05:13.600 --> 05:17.040
Now, Cat, who will Robbie be playing?

05:17.040 --> 05:21.140
Well, I've decided Robbie's role should be

05:21.210 --> 05:24.440
a motivational speaker...
Ooh, I can do that.

05:24.510 --> 05:27.550
...Who just drank some weird
beverage that makes his legs

05:27.610 --> 05:32.280
weak and wobbly.

05:32.350 --> 05:33.090
Okay.

05:33.150 --> 05:37.890
So I'm a motivational
speaker with jelly legs.

05:37.960 --> 05:41.830
Yeah. I'm creative.

05:41.900 --> 05:42.600
Wonderful.

05:42.660 --> 05:45.660
Robbie, tell us the character
you've chosen for Beck.

05:45.730 --> 05:51.840
Sure, one sec.

05:51.910 --> 05:53.110
Okay.

05:53.170 --> 05:56.510
Beck will be playing a guy
from england whose accent

05:56.580 --> 06:02.050
is really hard to understand, and he's always invading
people's personal space.

06:02.120 --> 06:05.380
No problem.

06:05.450 --> 06:10.160
Andre, what do you have in store for toro?

06:10.220 --> 06:12.360
Did you just call me toro?

06:12.430 --> 06:14.030
Maybe.

06:14.090 --> 06:15.760
It's Tori.

06:15.830 --> 06:16.600
I know.

06:16.660 --> 06:21.870
But I do love that fatty tuna.

06:21.940 --> 06:24.770
Should I be offended?

06:24.840 --> 06:25.440
Okay.

06:25.510 --> 06:27.910
Tori's character will be a cop who wears

06:27.970 --> 06:33.050
way too much red lipstick and
is obsessed with raisin bran.

06:33.110 --> 06:34.680
Where did you come up with that?

06:34.750 --> 06:37.050
Well, see, I had this dream last night,

06:37.120 --> 06:40.350
and this lady cop was all,
like... she was all like...

06:40.420 --> 06:45.460
And then I was like...
I just thought of it.

06:45.530 --> 06:49.130
All right, Tori, tell us what Jade will be.

06:49.200 --> 06:52.430
Love to.

06:52.500 --> 06:54.970
Jade will be an innocent
farm girl from Alabama

06:55.040 --> 06:59.770
who's always super sweet and nice and never gets upset
about anything.

06:59.840 --> 07:05.240
I'd rather slam my tongue in a car door.

07:05.310 --> 07:07.550
Now tell us who andrere will be playing.

07:07.610 --> 07:10.350
Ulch. Fine.

07:10.420 --> 07:13.220
You're gonna be a guy who's just
finished running a marathon...

07:13.290 --> 07:14.090
Okay.

07:14.150 --> 07:18.890
...Who also happens to
be nine months pregnant.

07:18.960 --> 07:23.230
Who's the daddy?

07:25.000 --> 07:31.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:38.310 --> 07:40.510
Oh!

07:40.580 --> 07:49.860
Drinks, chips, dip, nuts and liquid soap.

07:51.490 --> 07:53.760
Party time!

07:53.830 --> 07:59.570
Well, I wonder who will be arriving first.

07:59.630 --> 08:01.470
Well, hello there.

08:01.540 --> 08:04.300
I am a police officer.

08:04.370 --> 08:07.240
Would you like some raisin bran?

08:07.310 --> 08:10.140
Ah, no, thank you, but please come in.

08:10.210 --> 08:13.050
Yeah, sure.

08:13.110 --> 08:14.410
And your name is?

08:14.480 --> 08:15.810
Officer p'desko.

08:15.880 --> 08:18.320
Do you have anything sharp
and/or pointy in your pockets

08:18.390 --> 08:21.050
that could injure me?

08:21.120 --> 08:24.060
I certainly hope not.

08:25.160 --> 08:26.060
Doorbell!

08:26.130 --> 08:27.260
I'll answer it.

08:27.330 --> 08:29.090
M'kay.

08:29.160 --> 08:31.030
Ah, good evening. Come in.

08:31.100 --> 08:37.240
Thanks, thank you. Hoooo.

08:37.299 --> 08:41.440
Yes, thanks for welcoming
us into your fine home!

08:41.510 --> 08:43.640
But don't forget to thank yourself!

08:43.710 --> 08:49.580
Because if you just believe in yourself, there's nothin'
that you can't do!

08:49.650 --> 08:54.050
Hey, I'm pregnant and I just ran 26 miles.

08:54.120 --> 08:56.420
Can I please get some water?

08:56.490 --> 08:57.390
Of course.

08:57.460 --> 08:59.160
It's right over there.

08:59.230 --> 09:01.630
Okay.

09:01.700 --> 09:03.400
Ah, I didn't catch your name.

09:03.460 --> 09:03.960
Oh, I'm sorry.

09:04.030 --> 09:08.570
I was, uh, just admiring
ur fine animal statuettes.

09:08.640 --> 09:11.970
I'm Kevin cornbloom, motivational speaker!

09:12.040 --> 09:19.010
I've devoted my life to helping
teens... oh, there go the legs.

09:19.080 --> 09:20.680
Are you all right?

09:20.750 --> 09:25.080
I'm right as rain, thank you for asking.

09:25.150 --> 09:26.950
10-21, we got a man down!

09:27.020 --> 09:30.520
Caucasian male, glasses,
afro, possibly Jewish.

09:30.590 --> 09:32.730
Can I offer you some raisin bran?

09:32.790 --> 09:35.290
No, thank you, officer.

09:35.360 --> 09:40.530
Man, I'm so tired and pregnant.

09:40.600 --> 09:41.670
I gotta sit down.

09:41.740 --> 09:43.470
Please, take any seat.

09:43.540 --> 09:45.970
Thanks. Hooooo.

09:46.040 --> 09:52.010
Yes, just believe in your dreams,
and you can sit in any chair,

09:52.080 --> 09:54.880
anywhere!

09:54.950 --> 09:58.080
Yeah. Okay.

09:58.150 --> 10:00.350
Hoooo.

10:01.490 --> 10:02.890
Doorbell!

10:02.960 --> 10:07.390
I'll get it.

10:07.460 --> 10:10.130
What I wanna know is
what part of the chicken

10:10.200 --> 10:12.830
do the nuggets come from?

10:12.900 --> 10:15.000
Can someone tell me this, please?

10:15.070 --> 10:19.540
I mean, where's the wacky farm
that raises nugget chickens?

10:19.610 --> 10:23.040
Hilarious observations.

10:23.110 --> 10:24.440
Please come in.

10:24.510 --> 10:28.510
And don't get me started on airplane food.

10:28.580 --> 10:32.020
I notice that you're a standup comedienne.

10:32.090 --> 10:35.050
Where's the beef?

10:35.120 --> 10:38.190
I am a police officer.

10:38.260 --> 10:42.430
Would you like to join me in
a handful of raisin bran?

10:42.500 --> 10:45.060
What's the deal with raisin bran?

10:45.130 --> 10:47.030
Is it raisins? Is it bran?

10:47.100 --> 10:50.170
I wanna know.

10:50.240 --> 10:51.900
Ladies, please.

10:51.970 --> 10:56.180
It's not about the raisins, or the bran.

10:56.240 --> 11:01.480
It's about the future, and living your dreams,
and there go the legs.

11:01.550 --> 11:03.020
Oh!

11:03.080 --> 11:04.980
I think I'm gonna have a baby!

11:05.050 --> 11:08.820
Why did I just run that marathon?

11:10.260 --> 11:11.160
You all mingle.

11:11.220 --> 11:13.330
I'll get the door.

11:13.390 --> 11:14.490
Well, hello.

11:14.560 --> 11:15.590
I don't believe we've met.

11:15.660 --> 11:16.530
You are?

11:16.600 --> 11:17.100
Oh, yes.

11:17.160 --> 11:18.460
M'name is Malcolm Winchester fizzenworth.

11:18.530 --> 11:20.100
It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance.

11:20.170 --> 11:21.630
It's a lovely home ya have here.

11:21.700 --> 11:22.800
Let's step over in that direction,

11:22.870 --> 11:24.100
that way there, very good then.

11:24.170 --> 11:24.640
Sure.

11:24.700 --> 11:26.240
He got very soft lobes, doesn't he?

11:26.310 --> 11:27.740
Thank you. Don't pull.

11:27.810 --> 11:30.080
Hey. You.

11:30.140 --> 11:31.540
Why, hello, officer.

11:31.610 --> 11:34.310
Isn't this just a lovely shin-dig?

11:34.380 --> 11:37.720
I can see your belly button.

11:37.780 --> 11:41.550
Why, yes, that is my belly button.

11:41.620 --> 11:45.860
Have you ever considered
filling it with raisin bran?

11:45.930 --> 11:47.160
Well, no.

11:47.230 --> 11:49.160
My name is betty-sue golden-heart.

11:49.230 --> 11:54.330
I live on a farm in Alabama,
just north of a little...

11:54.400 --> 11:57.070
Now you're eating raisin bran.

11:57.140 --> 11:57.900
Mmmm.

11:57.970 --> 12:02.980
I just love eating cereal that's been manhandled
by your filthy hands.

12:03.040 --> 12:04.610
Uh-oh.

12:04.680 --> 12:08.650
I spy a fly with my little thigh.

12:08.720 --> 12:10.850
Thigh?

12:10.920 --> 12:14.820
Come here, you winged nuisance.

12:14.890 --> 12:16.120
Where'd it go?

12:16.190 --> 12:17.860
Well, I believe the fly in question

12:17.920 --> 12:20.030
went this way and then that
way, and then over there,

12:20.090 --> 12:23.230
and then round-about, and every way except for that way
and over yonder.

12:23.300 --> 12:24.630
There he is!

12:24.700 --> 12:28.730
Oh! C'mere! Time to die!

12:28.800 --> 12:32.540
Sikowitz!

12:32.610 --> 12:33.740
Are you okay?

12:33.810 --> 12:36.810
Who...
Who's there?

12:36.880 --> 12:37.740
It's Robbie.

12:37.810 --> 12:40.780
Ah! You broke character!

12:40.850 --> 12:43.680
You're out!

12:43.750 --> 12:45.020
You tricked me!

12:45.080 --> 12:47.320
Precisely! Now go home.

12:47.390 --> 12:48.750
Awww.

12:48.820 --> 12:51.920
It was so wonderful to meet you.

12:51.990 --> 12:55.130
Take care of yourself, mate, you seem like an effervescent
bloke.

12:55.200 --> 12:57.030
Beck, stop it!

12:57.100 --> 13:15.650
At least you're not pregnant and exhausted from runnin'
a marathon.

13:15.720 --> 13:17.690
Enjoy the raisin bran!

13:28.410 --> 13:30.850
9:26 P.M.

13:30.920 --> 13:37.590
So far, only Robbie shapiro has broken character,
and was promptly banished.

13:37.660 --> 13:43.590
That leaves five of my
students still in character.

13:43.660 --> 13:46.400
Why don't they make the
plane outta the same stuff

13:46.460 --> 13:48.470
they make the black box out of?

13:48.530 --> 13:52.000
Um, hellloooo?!

13:52.070 --> 13:57.170
That was quite an amusing commentary.

13:57.240 --> 13:59.710
I'll need to see your
license and registration.

13:59.780 --> 14:01.580
Oh. Sorry there, constable.

14:01.650 --> 14:04.110
I don't own a motorcar and
therefore have no such documents

14:04.180 --> 14:06.180
in me trouser pockets.

14:06.250 --> 14:10.850
Why don't you stop invading my personal space and have a little
of this raisin bran?

14:10.920 --> 14:15.430
I'm game, so why don't you
pop a dabble in me mouth?

14:15.490 --> 14:17.590
Well!

14:17.660 --> 14:21.600
Aren't you two havin' a fun time
eatin' raisin bran together?

14:21.670 --> 14:26.600
Well, it's... just be careful
now, mister british man,

14:26.670 --> 14:32.710
'cuz who knows what terrible things might happen to you
if that continues?

14:37.250 --> 14:40.850
Hello? Oooh.

14:40.920 --> 14:44.490
Andre! It's grandma!

14:44.560 --> 14:46.590
Uh, I'm sorry, this isn't Andre.

14:46.660 --> 14:49.930
I'm a pregnant marathon runner.

14:49.990 --> 14:51.230
Hooo.

14:51.300 --> 14:54.800
Andre, don't you play games with me!

14:54.870 --> 14:56.000
Oh my goodness.

14:56.070 --> 14:57.870
I think I'm gonna have a baby!

14:57.940 --> 14:59.140
Baby?!

14:59.200 --> 14:59.600
Oh!

14:59.670 --> 15:02.540
Why did I run that marathon
while I was pregnant?

15:02.610 --> 15:05.980
What the g are you talkin' about?!

15:06.040 --> 15:08.850
Andre!

15:09.610 --> 15:13.680
Who is that handsome young man over there?

15:13.750 --> 15:15.790
This is my nephew, Jason.

15:15.850 --> 15:18.790
He's staying with me while
his parents are in Bangkok.

15:18.860 --> 15:20.120
Does he have a girlfriend?

15:20.190 --> 15:24.530
Because as a police officer, I
need to know that information.

15:24.600 --> 15:27.030
No, I'm not dating anyone.

15:27.100 --> 15:30.970
Oh, then we have much to discuss.

15:31.040 --> 15:32.070
Where ya headed?

15:32.140 --> 15:34.600
I'm goin' with some guys to see
the wall dogs play at the moxy.

15:34.670 --> 15:36.610
I'll go with you to see the
wall dogs play at the moxy,

15:36.670 --> 15:38.510
I'll go right now.

15:38.580 --> 15:39.380
Bahhhhhnnn!

15:39.440 --> 15:42.750
Cat, you just broke character.

15:42.810 --> 15:44.210
Yay! Bye, everyone.

15:44.280 --> 15:49.220
I'll be at the moxy.

15:49.290 --> 15:54.220
And to think I was gonna let
that boy eat my raisin bran.

15:57.130 --> 15:58.830
More creme brulee?

15:58.900 --> 16:04.000
Hurry.

16:05.600 --> 16:07.370
Who's that?

16:07.440 --> 16:12.380
No idea.

16:12.440 --> 16:14.380
Hi.

16:14.450 --> 16:15.480
Tori's not here.

16:15.550 --> 16:18.720
Oh, I know.

16:18.780 --> 16:20.080
Trina's not here either.

16:20.150 --> 16:23.750
Well, good, 'cuz she doesn't
like me anyway, so... wait,

16:23.820 --> 16:26.660
aren you supposed to be at some method acting thing
at your teacher's house?

16:26.720 --> 16:27.260
I was.

16:27.330 --> 16:29.590
But I broke character and got eliminated.

16:29.660 --> 16:32.560
So sikowitz banished me.

16:32.630 --> 16:33.800
Hi, Robbie.

16:33.870 --> 16:34.730
Hi, Mrs. vega.

16:34.800 --> 16:38.070
That sweater looks fantastic on you.

16:38.140 --> 16:39.640
Thank you.

16:39.700 --> 16:43.910
Listen, um, it's our anniversary tonight,

16:43.980 --> 16:48.310
and we're watching a movie together...
Oh. What movie?

16:48.380 --> 16:51.350
Uh, it's an old one called
terms of endearment.

16:51.420 --> 16:53.320
Oops, I've never seen that one.

16:53.380 --> 16:57.690
Robbie.

16:57.760 --> 17:00.590
11:14 P.M.

17:00.660 --> 17:04.430
Only four of my students
remain in character.

17:04.500 --> 17:10.000
I have prepared some piping
hot quesadillas from a recipe

17:10.069 --> 17:13.970
I got from crispin glover,
back when we... well...

17:17.740 --> 17:22.780
Hello. May I help... I don't know you!
Ahhh!!

17:22.849 --> 17:24.150
Who's at the door?

17:24.220 --> 17:28.620
I'm not sure.
She was... where's Andre?!

17:28.620 --> 17:32.490
Wel ... ...
'S a d

17:36.190 --> 17:38.360
... ...

18:39.390 --> 18:45.660
The oven.

18:45.730 --> 18:50.530
My goodness that tray was hot.

18:50.600 --> 18:52.340
Well, lookie there.

18:52.400 --> 18:55.470
My skin's startin' to blister.

18:55.540 --> 19:00.980
And I do believe that's the sweet
smell of my burnin' flesh.

19:01.050 --> 19:03.080
Jade, perhaps I should
drive you... who's Jade?

19:03.150 --> 19:05.320
My name is betty-sue
golden-heart, a happy farm girl

19:05.380 --> 19:16.090
who's experiencing extreme pain right now.

19:16.160 --> 19:18.600
And yet she never broke character.

19:18.660 --> 19:20.460
Move this car!

19:23.230 --> 19:24.800
You broke character!

19:24.870 --> 19:28.810
And your neighbor's car window.

19:30.010 --> 19:39.850
Go inside. Go inside.

19:39.920 --> 19:41.820
Who laughs at terms of endearment?

19:41.890 --> 19:44.920
It's not a comedy.

19:50.800 --> 19:52.330
Hi, Tori's dad.

19:52.400 --> 19:54.160
Hi.

19:54.230 --> 19:55.830
This is Jason.

19:55.900 --> 19:57.070
And?

19:57.130 --> 19:59.840
Robbie texted me and said you
guys were watching a funny movie.

19:59.900 --> 20:01.340
It's not a comedy!

20:01.410 --> 20:04.370
Hey! You guys, come on in.

20:04.440 --> 20:09.580
Oh, popcorn!

20:09.650 --> 20:11.050
Is that Debra winger?

20:11.120 --> 20:12.280
Yeah, she's hilarious.

20:12.350 --> 20:16.090
She's dying!

20:26.160 --> 20:31.400
Ah, kids, it's getting late.

20:31.470 --> 20:34.700
I'll never forget the time I was
havin' kippers for breakfast

20:34.770 --> 20:38.640
and a musty old burger
flew right above my head.

20:38.710 --> 20:43.080
This method acting exercise
is becoming tedious.

20:43.150 --> 20:50.590
Raisin bran was invented by Kevin
mcraisinberg and Jack mcbran.

20:50.650 --> 20:54.020
I beg you to go home.

20:54.090 --> 20:56.990
You're reminiscent of a
flibbity-jibber with a nosh of kiwi

20:57.060 --> 20:59.530
and a noddy bit for the squabble.

20:59.600 --> 21:01.100
I can't take it anymore.

21:01.170 --> 21:06.770
All right!

21:06.840 --> 21:09.910
Since it's obvious neither
one of you are going

21:09.970 --> 21:12.080
to be breaking character anytime soon,

21:12.140 --> 21:18.920
and I can't stand being here
with either one of you anymore,

21:18.980 --> 21:20.950
I'm going to bed.

21:21.020 --> 21:23.520
You can help yourself to
anything in the refrigerator,

21:23.590 --> 21:32.160
but please do not look in the cabinet under the sink in my bathroom.

21:32.230 --> 21:35.630
Please.

21:35.700 --> 21:40.140
Good night.

21:40.200 --> 21:42.270
Have you ever seen a carnivorous wildebeast

21:42.340 --> 21:44.440
ruminate about Dan Schneider
while cavorting with...

21:44.510 --> 21:48.110
I am a police officer!

21:48.180 --> 21:58.150
Iggafiff.

21:58.220 --> 22:05.760
How is that funny?!

22:05.830 --> 22:07.330
Does she ever quit cryin'?

22:07.400 --> 22:10.050
Aw, she'll be dead in minutes.

22:33.960 --> 22:40.460
Hey. What time is it?

22:40.460 --> 22:42.670
You broke character!

22:42.730 --> 22:44.400
You lost!

22:44.470 --> 22:51.010
I am a police officer.
And I am victorious!

22:51.080 --> 22:55.910
Enjoy some raisin bran, ya freakish brit!

22:55.980 --> 22:57.450
This is officer p'desko!

22:57.520 --> 22:58.550
Code three!

22:58.620 --> 23:01.850
Wooo-wooo-wooowooo-
wooowooo-wooo-wooo-wooo-wooo.
