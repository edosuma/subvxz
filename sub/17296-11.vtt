What? Dude, tonight is my
turn to pick the flick.

00:34.208 --> 00:36.123
- Hardly.
- Both wrong. It's mine.

00:36.166 --> 00:38.212
- Heck, no!
- You are all mistaken.

00:38.255 --> 00:41.998
It has been three of the weeks since
I have chosen the moving pictures,

00:42.042 --> 00:44.957
and my selection will truly
bust the blocks.

00:45.001 --> 00:49.049
Tonight, we will be watching
the Frightmare Circus 3.

00:49.092 --> 00:51.181
A hilarious tale of a hungry clown mutant

00:51.225 --> 00:53.836
who's having quite the hard
time catching his meals

00:53.879 --> 00:56.926
because they keep running away.

00:56.969 --> 00:59.189
- No way, man.
I want something with action.

00:59.233 --> 01:00.538
Laser, explosions!

01:00.582 --> 01:03.541
Something like Bomb Hackerz.

01:03.585 --> 01:06.066
Ew. We should watch
Knock, Knock, You're Guilty!

01:06.109 --> 01:08.633
A thrilling detective noir with
the greatest twist of all time.

01:08.677 --> 01:10.418
Spoiler. The detective did it.

01:10.461 --> 01:12.811
Move it.
What about my Western?
Saddle Dance.

01:12.855 --> 01:16.206
Cowboys bringing justice
to a lawless land.

01:16.250 --> 01:18.165
Gunslingers galore! Pew, pew!

01:18.208 --> 01:20.123
Romance on the prairie.

01:20.167 --> 01:21.429
Enough of this nonsense!

01:21.472 --> 01:23.866
I'm putting my movie in
and nobody can stop me.

01:23.909 --> 01:25.215
But we don't even
know what it is.

01:25.259 --> 01:28.131
It's an awesome surprise.

01:32.831 --> 01:34.137
Titans, stop!

01:34.181 --> 01:36.008
This always happens.

01:36.052 --> 01:38.576
Don't you see? Whether we watch
kung-fu or war epics, or whatever,

01:38.620 --> 01:40.970
movie night is
about togetherness.

01:41.013 --> 01:43.103
Robin's right, yo.
I'll just put this back

01:43.146 --> 01:46.106
and we can all just chillz out
and talk it through.

01:48.369 --> 01:50.414
What did you do?

01:50.458 --> 01:52.112
Uh, uh, don't panic.

01:52.155 --> 01:54.462
Nobody panic!
Everybody stop panicking!

01:54.505 --> 01:56.377
Ahh! Movie night is ruined!

01:56.420 --> 01:58.727
Not if we retrieve
the second television.

01:58.770 --> 02:00.685
We have another television?

02:00.729 --> 02:05.037
Yes, in the basement. The one from
when we defeated the Control Freak.

02:06.604 --> 02:08.215
We know what you're planning.

02:09.085 --> 02:10.260
Right. New mission.

02:10.304 --> 02:13.220
Find the second TV.
Titans, to the basement!

02:18.225 --> 02:19.965
Man, I hate it down here.

02:20.009 --> 02:23.534
Indeed. It is abandoned
and without the happy feeling.

02:29.236 --> 02:32.761
The TV's bound to be in one of these.
Check 'em all.

02:34.110 --> 02:35.807
What?
That's just my meat locker.

02:35.851 --> 02:38.201
Gonna get my barbecue on later.

02:38.245 --> 02:40.638
See? Hot dogs.

02:40.682 --> 02:42.553
Okay.

02:42.597 --> 02:45.077
Perhaps the television
will be in the next one.

02:47.863 --> 02:50.735
Turn on the light, turn on the light!

02:52.215 --> 02:53.477
Turn off the light,
turn off the light!

02:53.521 --> 02:55.523
Whose adorable babies are these?

02:55.566 --> 02:59.222
Oh, that's just my creepy doll collection.

02:59.266 --> 03:00.919
Uh, I think we should
keep moving.

03:00.963 --> 03:02.182
Mama.

03:02.225 --> 03:03.574
It's gotta be the last door.

03:05.446 --> 03:06.403
A TV!

03:08.057 --> 03:09.537
What? Are you kidding me?

03:09.580 --> 03:12.235
Relax. I trapped a demon
down here years ago.

03:12.279 --> 03:13.628
Hey, Ted.

03:24.116 --> 03:25.857
Why is the television
full of the snow?

03:25.901 --> 03:28.773
- Leave, snow.
- It must not be hooked up right.

03:28.817 --> 03:31.211
Bad booyah!
It's a mess of cables back there.

03:31.254 --> 03:34.431
It's like a spaghetti explosion
but I don't want to eat it.

03:34.475 --> 03:36.041
Titans! New-new mission!

03:36.085 --> 03:39.697
We need to fix the TV, or
there will be no movie night

03:39.741 --> 03:42.352
or any TV ever again.

03:44.920 --> 03:47.488
I've got this, guys.
But if I'm gonna pull this off,

03:47.531 --> 03:49.403
I'll need every gadget I've got.

03:49.446 --> 03:51.361
Quantum color bar analyzer.

03:51.405 --> 03:54.364
Proton cable grapple gun.
Hey, my little buddy.

03:54.408 --> 03:55.887
Go, Rex, monkey, go!

03:55.931 --> 03:58.063
Beast Boy, do you copy?

03:58.107 --> 04:00.370
Follow the cables down until you
find the video auxiliary ports.

04:02.720 --> 04:06.420
Uh. I can't steal it, yo.
I didn't train for all this.

04:07.508 --> 04:08.683
Get a hold of yourself, man.

04:08.726 --> 04:10.772
Movie night depends on you.

04:10.815 --> 04:13.557
Just cut the red wire.

04:17.779 --> 04:20.216
Huh?

04:20.260 --> 04:21.913
Oh, man! You cut
the wrong one.

04:21.957 --> 04:23.393
Huh. I wonder what
that went to.

04:25.700 --> 04:27.571
- Warning. Power grid down.
- All jail cells opening.

04:27.615 --> 04:30.139
Oh, no!
The aspect ratio matrix
has been disrupted.

04:30.182 --> 04:33.708
If you don't cut the right wire in
10 seconds, the TV's gonna blow.

04:33.751 --> 04:36.101
Ahh! What? There's too many!

04:36.145 --> 04:38.495
Beast Boy, if you don't
step up and make the call,

04:38.539 --> 04:39.888
our night's gonna be ruined.

04:40.454 --> 04:41.716
Okays.

04:56.165 --> 04:58.428
The Beast did it.

04:58.472 --> 05:00.822
Guys, guys!
I did it!

05:00.865 --> 05:02.911
Does that mean
we get to watch my movie?

05:02.954 --> 05:05.305
Please, please, please!
It's super dope!

05:09.700 --> 05:12.355
Fellas, the TV box is stuck
in black and white mode.

05:12.399 --> 05:13.748
Wait. Where's the remote?

05:13.791 --> 05:15.663
Somebody must have given
it the old 23 skidoo.

05:15.706 --> 05:19.231
A missing controller, eh?
Sounds like a case that need cracking.

05:20.450 --> 05:22.278
I knew trouble came in
all shapes and sizes,

05:22.322 --> 05:24.367
and I spotted it the second
it walked through my door.

05:24.411 --> 05:28.284
The kid was in over his head.
He had a face with a smirk
and legs for days.

05:28.328 --> 05:29.720
Hey, looks. I'm an ostrich.

05:29.764 --> 05:32.157
Also, I want you to help
me find a remote.

05:32.201 --> 05:34.943
I quit taking cases like
these a long time ago.

05:34.986 --> 05:36.771
But I got nothing else to do.

05:36.814 --> 05:38.599
Sweet. Thanks, mama.

05:38.642 --> 05:40.818
First thing, I hit up the usual suspects.

05:40.862 --> 05:42.124
Pounded the pavement.

05:42.167 --> 05:43.952
Hey! I just paved
that pavement!

05:43.995 --> 05:46.084
What do you want?
I didn't see nothing, see.

05:48.522 --> 05:50.654
Hey, dish slinger.
Why don't you sling me some truth?

05:50.698 --> 05:52.613
What do you know about
missing remotes?

05:53.701 --> 05:55.093
I ain't no squealer.

05:56.617 --> 05:58.401
I was getting so close
I could smell it.

05:58.445 --> 06:00.447
And it smelled like dookie.

06:02.666 --> 06:03.798
Spill it, Red.

06:03.841 --> 06:06.017
I do not understand
what we are doing.

06:06.061 --> 06:09.238
But I believe I saw the
remote behind the microwave.

06:09.281 --> 06:10.282
Jackpot!

06:12.459 --> 06:13.938
Ha! We did it, kid.

06:13.982 --> 06:16.767
We sure did. Or should I say, "I did"?

06:16.811 --> 06:18.203
Now hand over that remote.

06:18.247 --> 06:19.683
Nice and slow like.

06:19.727 --> 06:21.511
My butt's got an itchy trigger.

06:21.555 --> 06:23.208
Why? How could you?

06:23.252 --> 06:25.515
I don't knows. I probably
could have just done it myself.

06:25.559 --> 06:28.257
But nothing makes sense
in this crazy world.

06:35.612 --> 06:38.485
Slow your roll, pilgrims.

06:38.528 --> 06:39.877
What? That remote's mine!

06:39.921 --> 06:41.879
No way!
He stole it from me.

06:41.923 --> 06:45.361
Looks like we got ourselves
an old-fashioned standoff.

07:00.681 --> 07:03.161
Draw!

07:03.205 --> 07:05.468
Enough of this.
This squabbling ends now.

07:05.512 --> 07:07.122
As do your lives.

07:07.165 --> 07:08.993
I have come from far-off lands to
eat your face like the omelet.

07:09.037 --> 07:10.604
I have trained
my whole life for this.

07:10.647 --> 07:12.432
My father will be avenged.

07:12.475 --> 07:14.521
My chi is strong.
My face punches are stronger.

07:14.564 --> 07:17.001
There's something very wrong with my mouth.
I should see a doctor.

07:26.707 --> 07:27.621
Mantis kick!

07:27.664 --> 07:29.013
Whining dog!

07:29.057 --> 07:30.101
Crying serpents.

07:30.145 --> 07:31.712
Ugly bear.

07:37.544 --> 07:39.720
Yo, this TV has buttons.

07:42.766 --> 07:44.594
Good booyah! Finally!

07:44.638 --> 07:46.640
Let's get
this movie night started.

07:46.683 --> 07:48.642
But what about
the popping of the corn?

07:50.078 --> 07:52.472
Beast Boy, this is taking
a really long time.

07:52.515 --> 07:54.517
- You set the timer, right?
- Yeah, bro.

07:54.561 --> 07:57.259
40 bags, three hours.
I've doubled the maths, yo.

07:57.302 --> 07:58.826
That's not even close to right.

08:01.698 --> 08:03.744
Get down!

08:09.576 --> 08:11.795
Ahh! Hot kernels!

08:11.839 --> 08:13.536
We're pinned down, man!

08:13.580 --> 08:15.538
It's a madhouse of buttery
brutality out there!

08:19.107 --> 08:22.110
I just want to go home
to my mama!

08:22.850 --> 08:24.852
Oh. Hey, mama.

08:27.637 --> 08:29.770
Toaster in the hole!

08:32.990 --> 08:35.558
- I need a mirror.
- Hey!

08:37.604 --> 08:39.344
- Ow!
- Okay, Titans!

08:39.388 --> 08:42.696
We gotta take that hill now!
Together, as a team!

08:42.739 --> 08:45.046
If not for us,
if not for our children,

08:45.089 --> 08:47.701
then for every other
bored roommate out there

08:47.744 --> 08:50.486
with nothing to do on a Friday night!

08:50.530 --> 08:51.792
Titans, go!

09:00.627 --> 09:03.804
Starfire!

09:03.847 --> 09:06.676
- Robin!
- Starfire!

09:06.720 --> 09:09.374
- That was very stupid.
- I know.

09:09.418 --> 09:11.463
We're going to carry
on without you.

09:11.507 --> 09:12.682
It's okay.

09:12.726 --> 09:15.511
- Carry on without me.
- I just said that.

09:18.688 --> 09:20.255
Pretty dramatic, right?

09:20.298 --> 09:21.952
Not really!

09:29.656 --> 09:32.615
We're almost there!
We're almost there, we're almost there!

09:32.659 --> 09:34.704
Ahh!

09:34.748 --> 09:36.140
Looks like...

09:36.184 --> 09:38.403
I won't get there in one piece.

09:38.447 --> 09:42.059
Promise me, you'll save
a seat on that couch for me.

10:00.817 --> 10:04.647
Yeah, I dids it!
I saved the day!

10:08.782 --> 10:11.785
Well, Beast Boy, since
you saved movie night,

10:11.828 --> 10:14.048
we can watch your movie tonight.

10:14.091 --> 10:16.616
Yeah, yeah!
You guys are gonna love this!
