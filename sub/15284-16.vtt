Hotch: Previously
on "Criminal Minds"...

00:05.145 --> 00:07.413
Dallas P.D. discovered
an unidentified male body,

00:07.480 --> 00:08.915
with the mouth sewn shut.

00:08.982 --> 00:10.516
Like the Silencer.

00:10.584 --> 00:12.817
It's obviously
a copycat.

00:12.885 --> 00:14.252
Yesterday while
we were in Florida,

00:14.319 --> 00:17.121
a body was found in the desert
outside Las Cruces, New Mexico.

00:17.189 --> 00:19.457
A man had his leg
amputated

00:19.525 --> 00:21.526
and replaced with
the leg of someone else.

00:21.594 --> 00:24.062
Morgan: Someone's out there
mimicking the crimes we solved.

00:24.129 --> 00:26.531
This is now an active case,
which we'll be investigating

00:26.599 --> 00:28.065
along with our other cases.

00:28.132 --> 00:30.300
I need to tell you something.
Maeve's missing.

00:30.368 --> 00:31.835
I think her stalker has her.

00:31.903 --> 00:34.271
Hello. I'm still here.

[Electronically modified voice]
Zug...Zwang.

00:38.242 --> 00:40.177

00:40.244 --> 00:42.913
It's a chess term. It describes
the point in the game

00:42.981 --> 00:46.549
when a player realizes
he'll inevitably be checkmated.

01:43.938 --> 01:46.258
I'm actually trying to finish up
so I can get home tonight.

01:46.273 --> 01:48.007
You got my voicemails?

01:48.074 --> 01:49.608
I haven't had time
to return calls.

01:49.676 --> 01:51.543
Agent Hotchner tells me
you're settling in nicely.

01:51.611 --> 01:52.778
I'm glad to hear it.

01:52.846 --> 01:54.279
It's a great team.

01:54.347 --> 01:57.616
Listen, I was hoping that we could talk,
over coffee, maybe.

01:57.684 --> 02:02.721
I thought we might try
to bury the hatchet once and for all.

02:02.789 --> 02:05.556
Erin, no disrespect,

02:05.624 --> 02:08.126
but it's not necessary.

02:08.193 --> 02:11.062
What happened between us
happened a long time ago.

02:11.130 --> 02:13.397
I've moved on.
You should, too.

02:13.465 --> 02:17.168
Well, that's...
What I'm trying to do.

02:17.235 --> 02:22.039
Look, I'm not
very good at this,

02:22.106 --> 02:25.909
but I want you to know that I'm
so sorry for what I did to you.

02:25.977 --> 02:28.244
Apology accepted?

02:28.312 --> 02:31.281
Apologies are just words.

02:31.348 --> 02:33.950
I want to make amends,

02:34.018 --> 02:37.153
and that takes work.

02:40.991 --> 02:42.391
Uh-oh.

02:42.458 --> 02:45.427
I think Blake could take her.
What do you think?

02:45.495 --> 02:47.563
Mm, their body language
hardly seems adversarial.

02:47.630 --> 02:50.232
Blake's making direct eye contact,
and the tilt of her head

02:50.300 --> 02:52.033
suggests she's willingly
engaged in conversation.

02:52.101 --> 02:54.435
Didn't Strauss throw her under
the bus back in the day?

02:54.503 --> 02:56.738
It was on the Amerithrax
case about 10 years ago.

02:56.806 --> 02:58.195
Evidently they apprehended

02:58.220 --> 02:59.808
the wrong suspect and she
let Blake take the fall.

02:59.809 --> 03:02.310
Well, I heard they even
demoted her a couple grades.

03:02.377 --> 03:05.479
Guess what just came
to the reception desk

03:05.547 --> 03:07.781
for an Agent Jennifer Jareau.

03:07.849 --> 03:09.549
From who?

03:09.617 --> 03:10.710
They must be from Will.

03:10.735 --> 03:12.319

'splainin' to do.

What? Let me see that.

03:25.634 --> 03:27.375
That's the same thing
Diane Turner said to you.

03:27.400 --> 03:28.885
Before she killed Maeve.

03:29.180 --> 03:31.271
But Diane's dead.
So who sent it?

03:31.589 --> 03:32.574
No idea.

03:32.603 --> 03:34.640
Wait... Didn't you say
the voice on the other end

03:34.665 --> 03:36.541
of the payphone
was computer generated?

03:37.036 --> 03:38.095
Garcia: That means
it could be from anybody.

03:38.120 --> 03:40.238
That means that it maybe doesn't
have anything to do with Maeve.

03:40.263 --> 03:42.036
Whoever it was...
they knew you would be

03:42.061 --> 03:44.559
at that phone booth. Which
means they were stalking you.

03:44.584 --> 03:46.113
Or us.

03:46.138 --> 03:47.779
What if this is the Replicator.

03:50.237 --> 03:51.791
I just came from
the Director's office.

03:51.816 --> 03:54.631
He doesn't like the idea that
his agents are being taunted

03:54.656 --> 03:57.411
and he wants me to keep him
personally in the loop.

03:57.727 --> 03:58.694
Catch me up, please.

03:58.719 --> 04:01.275
Okay, so, uh, the flowers cleared
all of our security checkpoints.

04:01.300 --> 04:04.066
Which means there's no explosives,
no chemical residue. Nothing.

04:04.091 --> 04:06.637
They were ordered from
a local florist-- Wendy's Bloomers.

04:06.704 --> 04:08.139
I checked Wendy,
her bloomers, the employees

04:08.206 --> 04:09.740
the delivery service.
They all came out clean.

04:09.808 --> 04:11.369
I managed to track down
the credit card.

04:11.372 --> 04:14.698
It's a stolen card number,
and it was ordered from

04:14.699 --> 04:16.209
a prepaid cell phone
in Philadelphia.

04:16.213 --> 04:18.781
But it's all about the message
he's trying to send.

04:18.849 --> 04:20.548
But they were sent
to JJ. Why her?

04:20.617 --> 04:22.252
Yeah, the original zugzwang
taunt was directed at me.

04:22.319 --> 04:24.487
If it's directed at one of us,
it's directed at all of us.

04:24.554 --> 04:27.090
It's only a matter of time
before his taunts turn to threats.

I'm posting security details
at each of our homes.

04:29.225 --> 04:33.996

What exactly is he trying to say?

04:34.063 --> 04:35.435
That the game has changed.

04:35.460 --> 04:38.101
First he was chasing us, copying
the cases that we'd solved,

04:38.201 --> 04:39.602
and now it's our turn
to chase him.

04:39.670 --> 04:41.437

04:41.505 --> 04:43.005
What do we know
about the Replicator?

04:43.072 --> 04:45.192
So far he's committed 3 murders
in 3 different states.

04:45.240 --> 04:47.909
The first was Maxwell Holmes,
28-year-old contractor,

04:47.976 --> 04:50.244
husband, and father
of two, from Dallas.

04:50.313 --> 04:51.613
He was found
with his mouth sewn shut

04:51.681 --> 04:53.981
4 weeks after we closed
the Silencer case.

04:54.049 --> 04:56.217
Next is an unidentified John Doe.
He was found in New Mexico

04:56.285 --> 04:57.686
near the Mexican border.

04:57.753 --> 05:01.087
JJ: His leg was severed and
someone else's was transplanted on.

05:01.155 --> 05:03.957
Do we have any idea
where the limb comes from?

05:04.025 --> 05:04.958
None.

Megan Lewinbuck,

05:10.498 --> 05:12.065

05:12.133 --> 05:13.734
All her joints
were dislocated

05:13.802 --> 05:16.069
and she'd been turned
into a human marionette.

05:16.137 --> 05:19.605
And that's everything so far.
Local police and Bureau field offices

05:19.673 --> 05:21.641
are going to keep us apprised
of any developments.

10:39.571 --> 10:42.406
He's either using a ruse
or a discreet threat of violence.

10:42.474 --> 10:43.674
Either way,

10:43.742 --> 10:46.143
he's awfully bold.

10:52.684 --> 10:54.785
Excuse me, miss?

10:54.853 --> 10:57.220
Hi. Would you care
to sign a petition

10:57.287 --> 10:59.122
to help clean up
the Delaware River?

10:59.189 --> 11:00.891
Sorry, I don't have time
right now.

11:00.958 --> 11:02.559
Did you know that
the Delaware River

11:02.627 --> 11:05.128
is the fifth most
polluted river in our country?

11:05.195 --> 11:06.563
I had no idea,
but good luck.

11:06.631 --> 11:09.499
Last year, they dumped
more than 6.7 million pounds

11:09.567 --> 11:13.402
of toxic chemicals there and
nobody's doing anything about it.

11:13.469 --> 11:14.904
You are.

11:14.971 --> 11:17.339
But they won't listen
until we all speak up.

11:17.407 --> 11:19.408
The Clean Water Act
is an unfulfilled promise

11:19.475 --> 11:22.811
and our children
are the ones paying for it.

11:22.879 --> 11:25.447
Come on,
it's just a signature.

11:25.515 --> 11:28.082
I'll even help you
with your groceries.

11:28.150 --> 11:30.151
No. No, that's ok.
Here, I'll sign.

11:30.218 --> 11:31.352
Oh, awesome.

11:31.420 --> 11:32.754
Thank you.

11:32.821 --> 11:33.755
Where?

11:33.822 --> 11:36.357
That line right there.

11:39.695 --> 11:41.128
The pen isn't working.

11:41.196 --> 11:43.531
Oh. Sorry about that.

11:43.598 --> 11:46.700
Just grab you another one.

11:46.768 --> 11:49.436
Do not scream
and do not run.

11:53.107 --> 11:56.376
Think about your son,
Shannon.

11:57.178 --> 11:59.612
His name's Eddie, right?

12:02.683 --> 12:05.217
I'm sure it was just
a misunderstanding.

12:05.285 --> 12:07.486
You have our full
cooperation.

12:07.554 --> 12:10.522
Isn't that right, Detective?

12:11.458 --> 12:12.992
I thought you needed
3 murders

12:13.060 --> 12:14.760
to have federal
jurisdiction.

12:14.828 --> 12:17.762
We have probable cause
to believe that the unsub

12:17.830 --> 12:20.398
is responsible for 3 other murders
in different states.

12:20.466 --> 12:22.968
Probable cause.
But you don't know for sure.

12:23.035 --> 12:25.704
That's what we're here
to determine.

12:25.771 --> 12:27.092
Look, we're wasting
our time here.

12:27.106 --> 12:28.539
We should be out there
looking for this guy.

12:28.608 --> 12:30.075
We're only here to help.

12:30.142 --> 12:32.209
A bunch of pencil pushers and
accountants. How you gonna help?

12:32.276 --> 12:33.510
Rizzo!
I'm sorry?

12:33.578 --> 12:35.378
Hey, what's with you?
You need a hug or something?

12:35.446 --> 12:38.181
I need to take you
off this case?

12:40.585 --> 12:41.518
No.

12:41.586 --> 12:43.353
Then cut the crap.

12:43.421 --> 12:45.990
[Cell phone rings]

12:48.092 --> 12:50.426
Jackson.

12:52.229 --> 12:53.763
Where?

12:53.831 --> 12:55.832
Ok, thanks.

12:55.899 --> 12:57.767
Another body just turned up.

12:57.835 --> 12:59.769
That makes 3.

12:59.837 --> 13:02.505
She's at Fairmont Park.
Get out there.

13:02.572 --> 13:04.606
And take them with you.

13:11.213 --> 13:14.049
Victim's name is Shannon Lavin,
29 years old.

13:14.117 --> 13:15.550
Husband said
she never came home

13:15.618 --> 13:17.052
from the grocery
store this morning.

13:17.120 --> 13:18.787
Another kidnapping
in broad daylight.

13:18.855 --> 13:20.554
This is turning into
a spree.

13:20.622 --> 13:21.822
An efficient one.

13:21.890 --> 13:23.930
It's been fewer than 12 hours since
she disappeared.

13:23.959 --> 13:26.293
We still have yet
to locate her vehicle.

13:26.361 --> 13:28.495
I bet he stole it
during the abduction.

13:28.563 --> 13:31.832
Found a way to get close to her
and threaten her somehow.

13:31.900 --> 13:33.067
Probably even made her drive.

13:33.135 --> 13:34.168
What else do we know
about her?

13:34.235 --> 13:36.836
She's got a 4-year-old kid.

14:03.894 --> 14:06.170
It's impossible to tell when or
where this photo was taken.

14:06.172 --> 14:08.240
It's shot on a telephoto lens
and the frame's too small.

14:08.308 --> 14:10.709
Well, his message
is getting more clear.

14:10.776 --> 14:12.211
He's not just taunting us,

14:12.278 --> 14:14.112
now he's targeting us.

14:14.180 --> 14:15.413
He must have channeled
years of anger

14:15.481 --> 14:16.915
to come up with a plan
as intricate as this.

14:16.983 --> 14:18.150
This is his way
of torturing us.

14:18.218 --> 14:19.952
This isn't just about anger.
This is about revenge.

14:20.019 --> 14:21.460
For what?

14:21.485 --> 14:22.786
If we can figure that out
that's how we'll catch him.

14:22.787 --> 14:24.498
So first it was Reid
at the phone booth,

14:24.523 --> 14:25.389
then me with the flowers,

14:25.390 --> 14:28.125
now Hotch.
Which one of us is next?

14:31.263 --> 14:34.031
Cause of death is definitely
exsanguination.

14:34.099 --> 14:35.766
She only has about
half a liter left.

14:35.834 --> 14:37.267
Same ligature marks
as the others.

14:37.335 --> 14:38.468
Was there Ketamine
in the system?

14:38.535 --> 14:41.171
Tox screen's not back,
but it's a safe bet.

14:41.239 --> 14:43.940
Her liver is inflamed
and she's slightly jaundiced.

14:44.008 --> 14:47.344
See that a lot with
Ketamine overdoses.

14:47.411 --> 14:49.903
Body snatchers told me
they found a picture

14:49.928 --> 14:51.647
of you at the crime scene.

14:51.648 --> 14:55.050
We believe that the unsub
is targeting us personally, yes.

14:55.118 --> 14:58.387
He's using these victims
to send us some kind of message.

14:58.454 --> 15:00.422
What kind of message?

15:00.490 --> 15:02.224
We're not sure yet.

15:02.292 --> 15:04.559
I hope you catch him soon.

15:04.627 --> 15:06.896
Hey, Aaron.

15:06.963 --> 15:09.230
She was a nurse.

15:09.298 --> 15:11.766
Just like Molly Patton.

15:13.869 --> 15:15.904
[Dialing]

15:15.971 --> 15:17.405
At your service, sir.

15:17.472 --> 15:19.240
Garcia, I need you to find out
everything you can

15:19.308 --> 15:21.309
about our second victim
Sandy Larson.

15:21.377 --> 15:23.511
Copy that, uh...

15:23.578 --> 15:25.812
Uh...

15:25.880 --> 15:28.248
She was a baby boomer,
originally from Chicago.

15:28.316 --> 15:30.850
Her husband Saul died
10 years ago from pancreatic cancer.

15:30.919 --> 15:32.019
Hotch: Employment?

15:32.086 --> 15:35.222
She was retired,
but before that,

15:35.290 --> 15:38.058
she worked as an administrator
at a hospice care facility.

15:38.126 --> 15:39.426
Anything before that?

15:39.493 --> 15:41.360
Before that, she was a...

15:41.428 --> 15:44.330
She was a registered nurse
for 30 years.

15:44.398 --> 15:45.831
That's the connection.

15:45.899 --> 15:48.140
I need you to go to ViCAP
and find out everything you can

15:48.168 --> 15:49.868
about homicides
involving nurses.

15:49.937 --> 15:52.071
I am like the wind.
Back in a flash.

15:52.139 --> 15:54.941
Where's that lightning?
Anyway...

16:26.737 --> 16:29.839
We've got a video conference
with Strauss in 10 minutes.

16:29.906 --> 16:31.174
She on the warpath?

16:31.241 --> 16:34.377
She's under a lot of pressure
to get results. We all are.

16:34.445 --> 16:36.245
Well, I've seen her
under pressure before.

16:36.313 --> 16:39.248
It was right when she
tried to ruin my career.

16:39.316 --> 16:41.617
This psychopath's message
is clearly personal

16:41.685 --> 16:43.719
and it's making us look bad.

16:43.787 --> 16:46.855
Someone profiling our profilers
undermines the efficacy

16:46.922 --> 16:49.491
of everything you do, and I'm
going to be frank with you--

16:49.558 --> 16:51.860
both the Director
and the Attorney General

16:51.927 --> 16:53.561
want to take you
off this case,

16:53.629 --> 16:55.630
and I can't say
I totally disagree.

16:55.698 --> 16:56.731
Why?

16:56.799 --> 16:58.367
Because you're victims now,
and I'm concerned

16:58.434 --> 17:01.302
your ability to investigate
may be compromised.

17:01.370 --> 17:04.405
Yeah, well, I assure you
our abilities are just fine.

17:04.473 --> 17:06.307
Ron?

17:06.375 --> 17:07.540
Yes, it is, ma'am,
absolutely.

17:07.608 --> 17:10.277
We know this case better
than anyone.

17:10.345 --> 17:14.382
All right. Well,
I'll tell the Director

17:14.449 --> 17:15.648
if he takes you
off the case,

17:15.717 --> 17:18.718
it's either with my resignation
or over my dead body.

17:20.753 --> 17:23.556
Ma'am, we're starting
the briefing now.

17:23.624 --> 17:25.558
I'll be right there.

17:25.626 --> 17:28.194
You catch this
son of a bitch, Aaron.

17:28.262 --> 17:29.762
Understood.

17:31.465 --> 17:33.465
Do you really think
they'd replace us?

17:33.533 --> 17:35.501
Sounds like you'd
have to kill Strauss first,

17:35.568 --> 17:38.037
and I doubt if that's
as easy as it sounds.

17:38.104 --> 17:39.938
All right,
so what do we know?

17:40.006 --> 17:40.815
This photo isn't digital.

17:40.840 --> 17:42.574
It was printed on real
chromogenic photo paper.

17:42.575 --> 17:43.909
So he's old school.

17:43.976 --> 17:45.677
We're still trying to ascertain
when the photo was taken.

17:45.745 --> 17:47.712
Garcia, I'm putting you
on speaker.

17:47.780 --> 17:49.736
You guys, there are a shocking

17:49.761 --> 17:51.582
number of weirdoes out there
who have a thing for nurses.

17:51.583 --> 17:53.717
But I got a gigantenormous hit.

17:53.785 --> 17:56.687
15 years ago, the BAU
had a case in Pittsburgh

17:56.755 --> 17:58.822
involving the stabbing
murders of 4 nurses.

17:58.890 --> 18:01.325
Pittsburgh? That's close
enough to be related.

18:01.393 --> 18:04.695
That rings a bell. But I didn't
work that case, Gideon did.

18:04.763 --> 18:06.696
Yeah, yeah. It ended
relatively well.

18:06.764 --> 18:08.244
The killer Jack Lee Kemper
was caught,

18:08.266 --> 18:10.033
and we managed to save
one of his would-be victims.

18:10.101 --> 18:11.801
Garcia, what happened
to Kemper?

18:11.869 --> 18:14.204
He died 5 months ago
from lethal injection.

18:14.272 --> 18:15.539
What if that
was the trigger?

18:15.606 --> 18:17.807
The Silencer copycat murder
happened about 5 months ago.

18:17.875 --> 18:19.494
We believe we're looking for

18:19.519 --> 18:22.421
a white male in his mid-40s
or possibly even 50s.

18:22.425 --> 18:25.293
He's criminally
and forensically sophisticated,

18:25.361 --> 18:29.364
so he may be an ex-con
or have law enforcement training.

18:29.432 --> 18:30.432
You saying
he could be a cop?

18:30.499 --> 18:32.300
It's unlikely, but
we can't rule it out.

18:32.368 --> 18:34.402
This unsub is using
his victims as a device

18:34.470 --> 18:37.339
with which to antagonize
the FBI, the BAU in particular.

18:37.406 --> 18:39.173
So he's after you.

18:39.240 --> 18:40.387
He's been copycatting
murder cases that we've

18:40.412 --> 18:41.533
closed all over the country.

18:41.726 --> 18:42.847
We do have reason to believe

18:42.854 --> 18:44.856
that he's been stalking
each member of this team.

18:45.229 --> 18:46.897
So he's extremely mobile
and has the time

18:46.965 --> 18:49.232
and the means with
which to get around.

18:49.300 --> 18:52.202
And the intelligence to cover
his tracks and remain evasive.

18:52.269 --> 18:54.343
We think it all started
15 years ago with a case

18:54.368 --> 18:55.305
we had in Pittsburgh

18:55.306 --> 18:57.507
that involved the death
of 4 nurses.

18:57.575 --> 19:00.076
That killer, Jack Lee Kemper,
was apprehended,

19:00.144 --> 19:01.578
and he was recently
executed.

19:01.645 --> 19:02.868
Because the most recent
exsanguination victims

19:02.893 --> 19:04.432
were also nurses,
we believe this case

19:04.532 --> 19:06.492
holds some kind of
special meaning to him.

19:06.584 --> 19:10.486
So we should be looking at Kemper's
family, friends, and associates.

19:10.553 --> 19:12.887
They may be trying
to avenge his death,

19:12.955 --> 19:15.390
or they might be convinced
that he was wrongfully accused.

19:15.458 --> 19:17.859
We should also look at friend
and relatives of the victims.

19:17.927 --> 19:20.596
They may blame us for not
solving the case fast enough.

19:20.663 --> 19:22.831
This unsub is intelligent
and highly organized,

19:22.898 --> 19:26.334
but he's also hellbent
on revenge.

19:26.401 --> 19:28.536
Which makes him
especially dangerous.

19:28.604 --> 19:30.037
Thank you.

19:35.444 --> 19:38.513
[Cell phone rings]

19:39.381 --> 19:40.814
Where the hell
have you been?

19:40.882 --> 19:43.150
You were supposed
to call me hours ago.

19:43.217 --> 19:45.652
We had a deal.

19:45.719 --> 19:48.655
Well, why set a time
if you're not gonna stick to it?

19:48.722 --> 19:50.590
You know how I hate that!

19:50.658 --> 19:54.394
It's inconsiderate,
never mind rude.

19:58.231 --> 20:01.433
Ok. Ok, you're right,
I'm sorry.

20:01.501 --> 20:03.302
I'm sorry.

20:03.370 --> 20:05.571
Thank you
for calling me back.

20:08.908 --> 20:11.210
There's just been
a lot going on.

20:12.279 --> 20:15.079
Nothing. Nothing.
Just...work and stuff.

20:15.147 --> 20:17.048
Don't worry about it.

20:23.922 --> 20:26.123
Well, we've ruled out
every name on the list.

20:26.192 --> 20:28.272
Our guy's not connected to
Jack Lee Kemper's victims.

20:28.327 --> 20:29.927
You know, if they were
just friends or lovers,

20:29.995 --> 20:31.928
there might not be an official record
of their relationship.

20:31.996 --> 20:35.365
The only living relative Kemper has
is a third cousin who lives in Alaska.

20:35.433 --> 20:37.167
Well, it wasn't
one of his friends.

20:37.235 --> 20:39.769
Kemper didn't have any.
He was a recluse with no social skills.

20:39.837 --> 20:42.172
Reid: Well, who else would
have a vendetta against us?

20:42.240 --> 20:44.575
Morgan: It could be a fan of Kemper's.
These guys always seem to have followers.

20:44.642 --> 20:46.176
What about somebody
we put into prison?

20:46.244 --> 20:48.311
It's a little hard to orchestrate all
of this from behind bars.

20:48.378 --> 20:49.913
Reid: What if somebody from
the outside's helping him?

20:49.980 --> 20:52.115
JJ: And how about other
suspects in the case?

20:52.183 --> 20:54.483
That's it.
What?

20:54.551 --> 20:57.353
Bidwell. Donnie Bidwell.

20:57.421 --> 21:00.824
Of course. He was the primary
suspect before we caught Kemper.

21:00.891 --> 21:04.492
We had a strong circumstantial
case, but DNA eventually cleared him.

21:04.560 --> 21:07.863
His name got leaked to the press
the second we grabbed him.

21:07.931 --> 21:09.264
Why so fast?

21:09.332 --> 21:10.699
We thought it was probably
someone in the local P.D.

21:10.767 --> 21:12.868
How long did we hold him for?
Couple of weeks.

21:15.105 --> 21:17.266
Garcia, I need everything
you've got on Donnie Bidwell.

21:17.273 --> 21:19.107
He was a suspect in
the Jack Lee Kemper case.

21:19.174 --> 21:21.139
Righty-o. Ok, he was picked up

21:21.164 --> 21:23.044
a couple of times for assault
and lewd behavior.

21:23.045 --> 21:26.179
He got off with time served
and probation.

21:26.248 --> 21:29.015
He is a recently divorced
father of two.

21:29.083 --> 21:31.151
He cannot hold down a job.

21:31.219 --> 21:33.354
I count 1, 2, 3, 4, 5...

21:33.421 --> 21:35.155
12 jobs
in the last 10 years,

21:35.223 --> 21:37.090
everything from fry cook
to used car salesman.

21:37.158 --> 21:38.458
Yeah, but before all that

21:38.483 --> 21:40.461
he was in construction
or something, right?

21:40.462 --> 21:43.996
Affirmative. He owned his own
hot mop shower, pan company,

21:44.064 --> 21:46.932
whatever that is. That business
went south after the arrest.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.869
His legal fees wiped him out,
and then a year later--

21:49.936 --> 21:52.739
oh, dear, he had himself
a nervous breakdown.

21:52.806 --> 21:55.708
No wonder he wants payback.
That accusation ruined his life.

21:55.776 --> 21:56.842
Have you got an address?

21:56.910 --> 21:58.377
Yeah, I got home and work
and I'm sending both.

21:58.444 --> 21:59.378
Thanks.

21:59.445 --> 22:00.885
We better make sure
we get this right

22:00.946 --> 22:02.614
before we arrest
this guy again.

22:02.682 --> 22:04.015
Rossi, Blake, and Reid
take the work address.

22:04.083 --> 22:05.784
The rest of us
will take the house.

22:48.157 --> 22:49.692

23:06.241 --> 23:09.577
He's going out back!
Are you ok?

23:16.017 --> 23:17.818
He's heading south.

23:34.768 --> 23:36.702
FBI! Don't move.

23:36.770 --> 23:38.437
Drop the gun.
JJ: Do it now!

23:38.505 --> 23:39.905
Drop it!

23:41.941 --> 23:43.843

24:05.397 --> 24:06.229
Aah!

24:06.297 --> 24:08.265
What's the matter?
A little tight?

Agent Morgan.

24:20.515 --> 24:21.462
Hey, listen.

24:21.463 --> 24:24.864
I just wanted to say, uh...

24:24.932 --> 24:26.099
Thank you.

24:26.167 --> 24:27.334
Don't mention it.

24:27.402 --> 24:29.702
No, no, no, you--

24:29.770 --> 24:30.737
you saved my life.

24:30.804 --> 24:32.739
I owe you.

24:32.806 --> 24:34.274
No, Detective Rizzo,
you don't owe me anything.

24:34.342 --> 24:36.076
We're both on
the same team here.

24:38.412 --> 24:41.180
So, uh...

24:41.248 --> 24:45.884
5 years ago my partner was--
was shot and killed,

24:45.952 --> 24:48.787
we were assisting
on a federal case.

24:48.855 --> 24:50.622
Ever since then, I just...

24:50.690 --> 24:52.358
I get it.

24:52.426 --> 24:53.259
I do.

24:53.326 --> 24:55.460
It's all good.

24:55.528 --> 24:58.896
I'm sorry
about your partner.

24:58.964 --> 25:01.032
If there's ever
anything you need--

25:01.100 --> 25:02.467
anything.

25:02.535 --> 25:04.235
I appreciate that.

25:11.242 --> 25:13.510
This guy ask
for his phone call yet?

25:13.578 --> 25:15.312
No. Just for these.

25:15.380 --> 25:17.347
They're anticonvulsants.

25:17.415 --> 25:19.616
Just a few weeks after his arrest,
he got jumped in a bar.

25:19.684 --> 25:22.152
Police report said
the guys who did it

25:22.220 --> 25:23.720
thought he was
the nurse killer.

25:23.788 --> 25:25.070
He took a blow to the head

25:25.095 --> 25:26.854
and he's had a seizure
disorder ever since.

25:45.374 --> 25:47.775
Can I get you anything else?

25:47.843 --> 25:50.712
You know, I, uh...heh,

25:50.779 --> 25:53.315
I wasn't on that case,
but I remember you.

25:53.382 --> 25:56.251
You probably recall
my associate,

25:56.319 --> 25:59.186
Agent Jason Gideon.

26:03.825 --> 26:05.559
Too bad he retired.

26:05.627 --> 26:09.096
He should be here
to see this.

26:09.164 --> 26:12.899
Yeah, you know, I know that things
went pretty bad with you

26:12.967 --> 26:16.636
after that whole thing.
I don't blame you for being angry.

26:16.703 --> 26:20.340
We made an erroneous
accusation.

26:23.344 --> 26:26.012
Oh, is that
what you call it?

26:26.079 --> 26:28.047
Erroneous?

26:28.115 --> 26:30.715
My life
went in the toilet.

26:30.783 --> 26:33.718
Well, you got judged
in the court of public opinion.

26:33.786 --> 26:36.821
That's gotta be hard.

26:36.889 --> 26:39.525
I mean, I'd want payback, too.

Don't sit there
and pretend

26:42.228 --> 26:44.163
like you know
how this feels.

You have no idea.

Found this
in the hall closet.

26:50.569 --> 26:52.236
It's all about the nurse murders
15 years ago.

26:52.304 --> 26:53.771
There's two sets
of files,

26:53.838 --> 26:55.540
one about his arrest,
the other about Jack Lee Kemper.

26:55.607 --> 26:57.275
It's not surprising
he obsessed over the case.

27:00.111 --> 27:01.779
Oh, sir, hi, it's me.

27:01.846 --> 27:03.446
Garcia, whose number
is this?

27:03.514 --> 27:05.883
Sorry. I had Anderson
give me a ride.

27:05.950 --> 27:07.384
I desperately needed
a shower and some food

27:07.451 --> 27:08.886
that wasn't sold
in a machine.

27:08.953 --> 27:10.620
Ok, so I cleaned out
Bidwell's computer

27:10.689 --> 27:12.122
and I checked
his phone records.

27:12.190 --> 27:15.392
He mostly calls his ex-wife.
A lot of emails, too.

27:15.459 --> 27:18.228
It is not a pretty picture.
They separated a few years ago.

27:18.296 --> 27:20.129
She took the kids with her.

27:20.197 --> 27:22.498
They just recently
got the divorce finalized.

27:22.566 --> 27:24.300
She's already pregnant
with another guy's kid.

27:24.367 --> 27:25.735
When was the divorce
finalized?

27:25.803 --> 27:27.170
Uh, 5 months.

27:27.237 --> 27:29.138
This might not have been about
Kemper's execution at all.

27:29.206 --> 27:30.807
The divorce might have
been the stressor.

27:30.808 --> 27:34.410

to think about it, ok?

29:08.933 --> 29:10.967
I know your girls are older now,

this is gonna be for them.

100,000 miles on it.

29:25.481 --> 29:27.883
You think he drove cross-country to
replicate those murders?

29:27.951 --> 29:30.219
Well, with his sporadic
work schedule, it's possible.

than flying.

34:37.241 --> 34:38.608
It's Bidwell.

34:43.847 --> 34:46.649
He was only alone
for a second.

34:49.820 --> 34:51.087
He took them all.

34:51.154 --> 34:52.822
Rizzo: Someone get
the paramedics!

35:03.708 --> 35:05.509
I just talked to Strauss.
She wants an update.

35:05.518 --> 35:06.580
What happened?

35:06.585 --> 35:08.652
Bidwell died en route
to the hospital.

35:08.716 --> 35:10.183
This guy did not profile
as suicidal.

35:10.250 --> 35:13.384
It's bizarre. If he wanted payback,
why would he kill himself?

35:13.452 --> 35:15.320
Maybe this is his version
of payback.

35:15.387 --> 35:17.355
If he takes his own life,
we can't put him in prison.

35:17.423 --> 35:19.524
Like the ultimate
escape plan.

35:19.592 --> 35:21.193
But his body language--
you should have seen it.

35:21.260 --> 35:23.195
When JJ mentioned
the copycat murders,

35:23.262 --> 35:25.396
he had no idea what
she was talking about.

35:25.464 --> 35:27.565
Something went wrong
and he called an audible.

35:27.633 --> 35:29.800
So what made him
change the plan?

35:29.868 --> 35:31.168
Well, he did it
after his phone call,

35:31.236 --> 35:32.737
so I'm guess that had
something to do with it.

35:32.804 --> 35:34.638
That's a dead end.
Local police traced the number

35:34.706 --> 35:35.671
to a prepaid cell phone.

35:35.696 --> 35:37.767
Garcia said it went dead
right after Bidwell's call.

35:37.843 --> 35:39.210
A partner?

35:39.277 --> 35:41.757
Well, if he really didn't know
about the other copycat murders,

35:41.813 --> 35:44.581
he wouldn't be somebody's partner,
he would be their pawn.

35:44.649 --> 35:46.883
So what if all the evidence
in Bidwell's house

35:46.951 --> 35:49.619
was put there
just so that we'd find it?

35:49.686 --> 35:51.254
Jazz hands at the ready.

35:51.321 --> 35:53.890
Garcia, I need you to go over all
of Donnie Bidwell's phone records again.

35:53.958 --> 35:56.126
And any emails, social media,
whatever you can find.

35:56.193 --> 35:58.828
But why do I have to check it again?
His emails were squeaky clean

35:58.896 --> 36:00.263
and he wasn't into
social media.

36:00.330 --> 36:01.496
The key is in
the phone calls.

36:01.564 --> 36:03.832
They had to have
communication somehow.

36:03.900 --> 36:05.801
Ok, most of his cell phone
conversations were

36:05.826 --> 36:06.769
to his ex-wife in New York.

36:06.770 --> 36:09.204
He called his mom in Tampa
once a week.

36:09.272 --> 36:10.565
The rest are just random.

36:10.590 --> 36:12.474
He called local businesses,
he checked movie times.

36:12.475 --> 36:14.542
Come on, baby girl,
it isn't random.

36:14.610 --> 36:16.844
The answer's in there somewhere.
You just gotta find it.

36:16.912 --> 36:18.557
All right, if you say so.

36:18.582 --> 36:20.529
I will re-get this party
started. Hit you back.

36:20.715 --> 36:22.483
If the Replicator's still out there,
then this whole thing's

36:22.550 --> 36:23.911
part of a much
bigger manipulation.

36:23.919 --> 36:29.056
I wonder what he's planning
for an encore.

36:50.610 --> 36:51.610
Go ahead, Garcia.

36:51.678 --> 36:52.918
I want to preface this
by saying

36:52.979 --> 36:55.414
I did not break any rules
by getting this info so fast.

36:55.481 --> 36:58.784
I may have scraped, scratched,
massaged, but no breaks. Not a one.

36:58.852 --> 36:59.785
Garcia.

36:59.853 --> 37:01.453
Ok. I checked the incoming
phone records

37:01.521 --> 37:03.689
and there was a call
that caught my eye,

37:03.756 --> 37:05.423
'cause for the last 6 months,
that call came in

37:05.490 --> 37:08.793
at the same time
at the same day, except for once.

37:08.861 --> 37:10.895
It's from an unknown
phone number,

37:10.963 --> 37:13.064
so I did what I do
and I made the number known,

37:13.132 --> 37:14.966
and it was from
a prepaid cell phone.

37:15.034 --> 37:16.868
Here's the kicker.
Oh, get ready.

37:16.936 --> 37:19.503
It was paid for with
the same stolen credit card

37:19.571 --> 37:21.872
used to buy JJ's flowers.
What? Bam!

37:21.940 --> 37:23.373
Can you triangulate
the number?

37:23.441 --> 37:25.521
Why ask me that question?
Triangulation is just about

37:25.543 --> 37:28.011
my favorite thing to do.
That phone is in Pittsburgh.

37:28.079 --> 37:29.746
That's a 5-hour drive.

37:29.814 --> 37:31.781
Or about 45 minutes
on the jet.

37:35.653 --> 37:38.420
Yes, ma'am. SWAT is
meeting us on the ground.

37:38.488 --> 37:42.158
All right, I will
keep you posted. Thank you.

37:42.226 --> 37:45.494
Strauss isn't altogether comfortable
with us going on this takedown,

37:45.562 --> 37:47.763
but I told her that
Pittsburgh P.D. would take the lead.

37:47.764 --> 37:49.765
You know,
if the Replicator used Bidwell,

37:49.833 --> 37:51.767
then somehow he
had to convince him

37:51.835 --> 37:53.434
to exsanguinate
those women.

37:53.502 --> 37:54.635
And cut off their eyelids.

37:54.703 --> 37:56.104
Bidwell was broken
and vulnerable.

37:56.172 --> 37:57.538
He was ripe for
a manipulation.

37:57.606 --> 37:59.107
The Replicator must
have counted on that.

37:59.175 --> 38:00.842
That's probably why he
chose Bidwell in the first place.

38:00.910 --> 38:02.944
Well, he must be
on persuasive guy.

38:03.012 --> 38:05.280
Persuasive enough to turn
Bidwell into a killer.

38:06.615 --> 38:08.916
Talk to me, mama.
You're on the right track.

38:08.984 --> 38:11.318
That phone hasn't been used
and hasn't moved.

38:11.386 --> 38:12.887
Make the next left.
I got it.

38:12.954 --> 38:14.388
Guys, I don't like this.

38:14.455 --> 38:16.924
It feels like we're going
exactly where he wants us to.

38:23.531 --> 38:24.742
All right.

38:24.767 --> 38:26.727
The snipers are set and
all the exits are covered.

38:26.767 --> 38:28.268
Air support?
Choppers are standing by.

38:28.335 --> 38:30.969
All right, the signal from the
cell phone's coming from this room.

38:30.970 --> 38:32.390
We'll enter in two teams.

38:32.391 --> 38:34.212
You from this side,
we'll come from this side,

38:34.213 --> 38:35.647
we'll meet in the middle.

38:35.715 --> 38:37.800
All right, guys, I need you
to keep it tight and stay alert.

38:37.801 --> 38:39.209
This guy's got
a vendetta against us.

38:39.234 --> 38:40.425
It could be an ambush.

38:41.620 --> 38:43.855
All right, gents,
on the move.
