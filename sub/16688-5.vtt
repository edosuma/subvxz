WEBVTT

00:10.040 --> 00:14.900
So, in conclusion, Rawls says
we're all due for some R&amp;R,

00:15.000 --> 00:16.900
so you guys
have this afternoon off.

00:17.000 --> 00:18.060
Awesome!

00:18.160 --> 00:20.220
Hyuh!
Hyuh!

00:20.320 --> 00:21.820
Why are you still here?

00:21.920 --> 00:23.060
Where else would we go?

00:23.160 --> 00:25.160
Yeah, the coffee shop's
back on Earth,

00:24.720 --> 00:26.720
so we don't have anywhere
to hang out.

00:25.960 --> 00:27.420
Well, this is where
I'm hanging out.

00:27.520 --> 00:29.640
You guys go somewhere else.

00:31.120 --> 00:33.120
And stay out of trouble!

00:34.480 --> 00:36.440
I guess we have been hanging out
in the barracks too much.

00:36.520 --> 00:38.060
Yeah.

00:38.160 --> 00:40.180
Whoa!

00:40.280 --> 00:41.700
It's like a city in here.

00:41.800 --> 00:43.220
Let's check this place out!

00:43.320 --> 00:44.580
( Bell rings )

00:44.680 --> 00:45.980
Whoa.
Whoa.

00:46.080 --> 00:47.620
Customers?!
Aah!
Aah!

00:47.720 --> 00:50.620
Welcome to the Chow Mein
and Don't Touch Anything Store.

00:50.720 --> 00:53.620
You may either buy chow mein,
or don't touch anything!

00:53.720 --> 00:55.420
Do you have credits?

00:55.520 --> 00:58.260
Feel free to look around and
buy things with your credits.

00:58.360 --> 01:00.360
But don't touch anything!

01:03.280 --> 01:04.780
( Crash! )

01:04.880 --> 01:07.100
Did I just hear you
touch something?!

01:07.200 --> 01:09.580
Uh, nope! Just dropping credits
on the floor!

01:09.680 --> 01:11.820
Better be credits.
Customers coming in

01:11.920 --> 01:13.920
and touching things
but don't buy anything.

01:13.760 --> 01:16.220
( Groans ) They drop
their credits on the ground,

01:16.320 --> 01:18.660
then it's my ground,
my credits.

01:18.760 --> 01:20.980
An arcade?

01:23.040 --> 01:24.420
Announcer: <i>"Chess TV."</i>

01:24.520 --> 01:27.100
<i>Dunst Opening.</i>
<i>Knight to C3.</i>

01:27.200 --> 01:28.380
<i>Not a common opening.</i>

01:28.480 --> 01:29.820
Oh!
Aah!

01:29.920 --> 01:31.460
Ew, a brain? Gross!

01:31.560 --> 01:32.740
Why are you in this case?

01:32.840 --> 01:34.540
Why am I in this cage?

01:34.640 --> 01:36.660
Well, there I was,
a poor country brain

01:36.760 --> 01:39.380
picking up groceries
for my brain family.

01:39.480 --> 01:41.700
As I reached for
the brain baby formula,

01:41.800 --> 01:43.940
that guy
jumped out of nowhere

01:44.040 --> 01:46.860
and trapped me
in this miniature steel prison!

01:46.960 --> 01:49.100
Wow, why'd he do that?
I don't know.

01:49.200 --> 01:52.340
Probably because he just doesn't
like big, floaty brains!

01:52.440 --> 01:54.780
Well, that's not very fair.
I know!

01:54.880 --> 01:58.020
And now all I have to keep me
company are my chess shows.

01:58.120 --> 02:00.300
I just want to see my wife
and kids again.

02:00.400 --> 02:01.660
Is that so wrong?

02:01.760 --> 02:03.660
No, it isn't.
Well, tell you what.

02:03.760 --> 02:05.260
There's a key on that wall.

02:05.360 --> 02:07.460
You could unlock
this soulâsucking enclosure,

02:07.560 --> 02:10.100
and I could be free
to travel as I please.

02:10.200 --> 02:11.460
I don't know.

02:11.560 --> 02:13.660
I've dealt with a lot of
disembodied stuff before.

02:13.760 --> 02:14.860
You sure you're not crazy?

02:14.960 --> 02:16.660
I assure you,
I'm not crazy.

02:16.760 --> 02:19.220
This situation is crazy.

02:19.320 --> 02:20.940
Now, why don't you
go get that key

02:21.040 --> 02:23.260
so I can stretch my stem
a little?

02:23.360 --> 02:26.000
Okay...

02:27.760 --> 02:29.100
( Laughing ) Yeah!
Aah!

02:29.200 --> 02:32.180
Fooled ya!
I'm not a country brain.

02:32.280 --> 02:35.180
I'm an evil brain,
and I'm not married.

02:35.280 --> 02:37.220
I'm not even dating anybody
right now.

02:37.320 --> 02:40.100
( Laughs ) Yeah!

02:40.200 --> 02:41.900
Hmm.
This is actually pretty goââ

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
Aah!

02:45.440 --> 02:48.660
Aaaaaaah!
What have you done?!

02:48.760 --> 02:50.340
He said he wasn't crazy.

02:50.440 --> 02:54.100
That brain led a crime wave that
nearly ruined this quadrant!

02:54.200 --> 02:55.900
You must stop him!

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
Well, why was he locked up
in a birdcage

02:57.480 --> 02:59.020
and not
a maximumâsecurity prison?

02:59.120 --> 03:01.900
You ever imprisoned
an evil brain before?

03:02.000 --> 03:03.060
Uh, nope.

03:03.160 --> 03:04.620
Well,
then back off, man.

03:04.720 --> 03:06.720
Just get him, all right?

03:07.120 --> 03:09.640
( Screaming )

03:11.400 --> 03:13.700
( Laughs maniacally )

03:13.800 --> 03:15.540
( Groans )

03:15.640 --> 03:17.580
( Both panting )

03:17.680 --> 03:19.500
( Panting )

03:19.600 --> 03:21.300
Gimme a boost!
( Grunts )

03:21.400 --> 03:22.780
Aah!

03:22.880 --> 03:24.340
Aah!

03:24.440 --> 03:25.860
( Groans )

03:25.960 --> 03:27.220
( Grunts )

03:27.320 --> 03:29.820
Cornered, eh?

03:29.920 --> 03:32.540
Looks like somebody isn't
as smart as he thought he was.

03:32.640 --> 03:34.500
Stay away, man.

03:34.600 --> 03:37.140
Whoa, whoa!
He's got a stick!

03:37.240 --> 03:39.340
Where am I gonna
swing this stick?

03:39.440 --> 03:41.060
I'm unpredictable, man!

03:41.160 --> 03:42.620
Aah!
Not in the face!

03:42.720 --> 03:43.980
Aah!
( Laughs )

03:44.080 --> 03:45.100
My shin!

03:45.200 --> 03:47.060
I wasn't expecting that!

03:47.160 --> 03:48.380
( Laughs )

03:48.480 --> 03:51.140
You guys are so dumb!

03:51.240 --> 03:54.020
That's why
you'll never catch me.

03:54.120 --> 03:56.860
( Laughs )

03:56.960 --> 03:59.740
Ugh. Why is everything in space
so gross?

03:59.840 --> 04:01.660
Come on, dude.

04:01.760 --> 04:04.020
( Indistinct talking )

04:04.120 --> 04:06.620
He's got to be here
somewhere.

04:06.720 --> 04:08.720
There he is!

04:09.560 --> 04:11.060
( Laughs )

04:11.160 --> 04:13.980
So long, flesh bags!

04:14.080 --> 04:16.940
( Panting )
Always one step ahead.

04:17.040 --> 04:19.040
How are we gonna
catch up to him?

04:18.480 --> 04:20.780
( Both panting )

04:20.880 --> 04:22.660
( Gasps )
I've got an idea.

04:22.760 --> 04:25.200
( Both panting )

04:26.800 --> 04:28.060
Hey. Could we ââ

04:28.160 --> 04:29.460
Yeah, yeah.
Come in.

04:29.560 --> 04:31.560
You're making me miss it.
Huh?
Huh?

04:32.320 --> 04:34.140
Check this guy out!

04:34.240 --> 04:37.180
He yells at these kids
every time he walks by.

04:37.280 --> 04:38.740
Dude just doesn't get it.

04:38.840 --> 04:40.180
( Chuckles )

04:40.280 --> 04:43.500
Hey. Have you seen a crazy brain
anywhere?
Nah.

04:43.600 --> 04:46.700
I mostly just watch that angry
guy or one of my other shows.

04:46.800 --> 04:48.300
Feel free to take a look.

04:48.400 --> 04:50.380
We got
that awkward first date,

04:50.480 --> 04:54.820
that happy bigâheaded man who
sleeps, and whatever this is.

04:54.920 --> 04:56.140
( Gasps )
It's the brain!

04:56.240 --> 04:57.380
He's headed for our dome!

04:57.480 --> 04:59.780
Good luck tall guy
and short guy!

04:59.880 --> 05:02.660
I hope you can make it back
to Channel 47!

05:02.760 --> 05:05.100
The cart!
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

05:05.200 --> 05:06.540
( Tires squeal )

05:06.640 --> 05:10.000
Sorry!
Official space tree business!

05:11.920 --> 05:14.240
Sorry!
Official space tree business!

05:15.200 --> 05:16.660
( Slurps )

05:16.760 --> 05:18.140
What do we do, man?

05:18.240 --> 05:20.240
We're gonna get in
so much trouble.

05:19.560 --> 05:21.020
No, dude.
We'll be fine.

05:21.120 --> 05:23.120
We'll capture this brain
and fix this mess

05:22.760 --> 05:24.760
before anyone finds out.

05:28.920 --> 05:30.660
( Tires squeals )

05:30.760 --> 05:31.980
( Rumbling )

05:32.080 --> 05:33.900
What's going on?

05:42.520 --> 05:44.520
Topânotch pushâups there,
Cadet.

05:45.400 --> 05:46.780
Huh?

05:46.880 --> 05:48.880
Whose dome is that,
Cadet?

05:48.040 --> 05:49.580
Uh, the park, sir.

05:49.680 --> 05:50.740
Code red!

05:50.840 --> 05:52.780
( Alarm blares )

05:52.880 --> 05:54.620
We got to get up there!

05:54.720 --> 05:55.860
( Cellphone rings )

05:55.960 --> 05:58.140
Dude, it's Benson!
Hello?

05:58.240 --> 06:00.660
Why is the park blasting off
into space?

06:00.760 --> 06:02.900
I know you two have something
to do with this.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.060
Oh, so because
the park is missing,

06:05.160 --> 06:07.160
we had something
to do with it?

06:06.320 --> 06:07.820
( Cellphone rings )

06:07.920 --> 06:10.180
Why has your dome taken off
without clearance?!

06:10.280 --> 06:13.540
I don't know. I was just trying
to eat my Tuscan chicken salad.

06:13.640 --> 06:15.700
You don't know what's going on
in your own park?

06:15.800 --> 06:18.260
That is unacceptable!
Drop and give me 50!

06:18.360 --> 06:22.180
Mordecai and Rigby,
I have footage of you
driving into your dome.

06:22.280 --> 06:24.740
Rigby set this evil brain loose
from this creepy old guy,

06:24.840 --> 06:26.500
and now it's flying the dome
into space.

06:26.600 --> 06:28.580
What?!
Why am I
not surprised?

06:28.680 --> 06:30.420
Old guy.

06:30.520 --> 06:32.700
Someone get me Keith
on the line!

06:32.800 --> 06:34.340
( Cellphone rings )
Hello?

06:34.440 --> 06:36.900
Why are we having another
brain incident, Keith?

06:37.000 --> 06:38.900
You said you had this
under control.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.340
It's not my fault.
I put him in a birdcage.

06:41.440 --> 06:45.220
These two guys came into my
shop, all touching everything.

06:45.320 --> 06:47.500
They released the brain.

06:47.600 --> 06:49.700
That was
a dangâgood birdcage.

06:49.800 --> 06:51.540
Your guys messed up,
Benson!

06:51.640 --> 06:55.300
Space tree protocol dictates we
have to shoot rogue domes down!

06:55.400 --> 06:56.700
All: What?!
Wait.

06:56.800 --> 06:58.800
Please, just give us a chance
to catch him!

06:57.960 --> 06:59.700
Yeah. Keith,
how did you catch him?

06:59.800 --> 07:03.140
I beat him at chess,
but that was a long time ago.

07:03.240 --> 07:06.340
He's too good now.
You cannot beat him.

07:06.440 --> 07:07.500
Colonel,
I have a plan.

07:07.600 --> 07:09.180
Can you give us
more time?

07:09.280 --> 07:11.740
You have 10 minutes before
the dome's getting blasted.

07:11.840 --> 07:13.840
( Cellphone beeps )
What's your plan?

07:13.280 --> 07:15.900
I'm gonna need a chess board
and a big salad.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
I'm hungry.

07:19.840 --> 07:21.620
Hey, Brain.

07:21.720 --> 07:24.180
Wait, wait, wait!
Stop! Don't shoot!

07:24.280 --> 07:26.460
If you shoot us with that gun,
everyone will know

07:26.560 --> 07:28.700
you couldn't outsmart us
with your wits.

07:28.800 --> 07:32.380
Ha! Beating you with my wits
would be 1 million times easier

07:32.480 --> 07:34.220
than pulling this trigger.

07:34.320 --> 07:35.420
What do you propose?

07:35.520 --> 07:37.380
How about
a game of chess?

07:37.480 --> 07:40.300
Chess? Chess?
( Laughs )

07:40.400 --> 07:42.180
You've got no chance.

07:42.280 --> 07:44.340
If you're so sure,
then let's play.

07:44.440 --> 07:47.940
Winner gets the dome,
loser leaves the dome.

07:48.040 --> 07:51.420
And get sucked into
the vacuum of space?

07:51.520 --> 07:52.940
Uh, yeah, I guess so.

07:53.040 --> 07:55.880
Then I accept.
Let's play.

08:00.600 --> 08:04.140
Did you know there are only 20
possible first moves in chess?

08:04.240 --> 08:05.740
Pretty crazy, huh?

08:05.840 --> 08:08.940
I choose pawn to E4.

08:09.040 --> 08:12.940
Are you ready for the fastâpaced
actin of a king pawn opening?

08:13.040 --> 08:14.980
What will you choose?

08:15.080 --> 08:16.900
That one? Ha!

08:17.000 --> 08:19.820
Ahh. Pawn to E5.

08:19.920 --> 08:21.300
Pathetic.

08:21.400 --> 08:22.620
( Alarm blaring )

08:22.720 --> 08:25.420
Prepare to light this dome up.

08:25.520 --> 08:27.520
Arming the parkâseeking
missiles.

08:32.160 --> 08:35.540
Evil Brain:
Did you know that your skin
is your largest organ?

08:35.640 --> 08:37.460
Mine's my brain.

08:37.560 --> 08:41.300
Your epidermis,
or as I like to call it,

08:41.400 --> 08:44.660
your epiâdumbness,
it won't help you in chess.

08:44.760 --> 08:46.980
Queen to H5.

08:47.080 --> 08:50.000
Horse to this square.

08:50.640 --> 08:54.980
You calling it a horse
makes me want to vomit.

08:55.080 --> 08:57.080
( Groans ) Huh?
( Cellphone rings )

08:57.800 --> 08:59.960
Sir, we're getting out of
weapons range. What do we do?

09:00.040 --> 09:02.460
( Sighs )
Then we have no choice.

09:02.560 --> 09:04.580
Fire.

09:04.680 --> 09:06.660
Bishop to C4.

09:06.760 --> 09:09.340
You're probably asking yourself,
"What is a bishop?"

09:09.440 --> 09:12.980
Pleas tell me,
because I'm so ignorant.

09:13.080 --> 09:15.980
Or perhaps you're thinking...
( Imitates wind blowing )

09:16.080 --> 09:18.200
Because your brain is so small
that the only thing

09:18.280 --> 09:21.360
it could think of
is the sound of a small breeze.

09:23.760 --> 09:27.000
Are you ready for me
to blow your mind?

09:29.480 --> 09:32.580
Queen takes F7.

09:32.680 --> 09:34.380
( Alarm continues )

09:51.320 --> 09:52.380
Checkmate!

09:52.480 --> 09:53.780
( Laughs )

09:53.880 --> 09:55.620
Ohâhoâhoâhoâho!

09:55.720 --> 09:58.380
I can't believe you fell
for Scholars Mate.

09:58.480 --> 10:00.300
It's the oldest trick
in the book!

10:00.400 --> 10:02.260
( Laughs ) Huh?

10:02.360 --> 10:03.900
Hey! What?
Got him!

10:04.000 --> 10:05.060
<i>Rawls, we got him!</i>

10:05.160 --> 10:06.540
( Laughs )

10:06.640 --> 10:08.940
Mordecai and Rigby,
you ignorant geniuses!

10:09.040 --> 10:11.040
Hooâahh!

10:12.640 --> 10:14.260
( Both sigh )
Aah!

10:14.360 --> 10:15.460
Let me out of here!

10:15.560 --> 10:17.260
Ew! So gross!

10:17.360 --> 10:18.660
Pass me the chess board.

10:18.760 --> 10:20.020
( Groans )

10:20.120 --> 10:21.340
Stop. Let me go.

10:21.440 --> 10:22.500
Wait! Stop!

10:22.600 --> 10:23.940
No!

10:24.040 --> 10:26.900
You haven't seen the last of me!

10:27.000 --> 10:31.220
I'll get you for this,
Mordecai and Rigby!

10:31.320 --> 10:33.720
I really feel like
getting chow mein.
