00:23.957 --> 00:26.767
Colonel Vidor, we have met the enemy.

00:26.827 --> 00:28.170
And they are us.

00:31.965 --> 00:34.377
If anybody knows where Sin Jin is, he does.

00:34.434 --> 00:37.347
I know he was your friend
before, but he's gone bad.

00:38.238 --> 00:41.242
Bo-Dai to group. Daddy's in the groove.

00:46.280 --> 00:49.386
You wanna know the truth,
Hawke, the crazy, rotten truth?

00:49.449 --> 00:51.190
I know where Sin Jin is!

01:59.152 --> 02:02.133
This briefing is from File A56-7W,

02:02.189 --> 02:03.361
classified: Top Secret.

02:03.423 --> 02:06.700
Subject: Airwolf
A Mach 1-plus attack helicopter

02:06.760 --> 02:09.263
with the most advanced weapons
system in the air today.

02:09.329 --> 02:11.832
It has been hidden somewhere
in the western United States

02:11.898 --> 02:13.707
by its test pilot, Stringfellow Hawke.

02:13.767 --> 02:15.440
Hawke has promised to return Airwolf

02:15.502 --> 02:19.177
only if we can find his brother
Sin Jin, an MIA in Vietnam.

02:19.239 --> 02:21.082
We suspect that Archangel, Deputy Director

02:21.141 --> 02:22.950
of the agency that built Airwolf,

02:23.010 --> 02:25.490
is secretly helping Hawke in
return for Hawke's flying Airwolf

02:25.545 --> 02:27.582
on missions of national concern.

02:27.648 --> 02:30.720
Stringfellow Hawke is 34,
a brilliant combat pilot

02:30.784 --> 02:32.923
and a recluse since his
brother's disappearance.

02:32.986 --> 02:34.932
His only friend is Dominic Santini,

02:34.988 --> 02:37.525
whose air service is the cover
for their government work.

02:37.591 --> 02:41.038
With Hawke and Santini flying as a team
at speeds rivaling the fastest jets,

02:41.094 --> 02:42.801
backed by unmatched firepower,

02:42.863 --> 02:45.571
Airwolf is too dangerous to be
left in unenlightened hands.

02:45.632 --> 02:47.771
Finding it is your 1st priority.

03:44.157 --> 03:48.196
Attention. Attention.
Border violation, Section 6.

03:48.261 --> 03:49.831
Intruder aircraft.

03:49.896 --> 03:53.434
Contact, 030 degrees, northeast.

03:53.734 --> 03:55.407
8 miles and closing.

03:55.469 --> 03:58.507
Condition red. Repeat, condition red.

04:56.863 --> 05:00.037
This is Bo-Dai. Set up the gauntlet, kids.

05:01.001 --> 05:03.242
Daddy will be right back with our guests.

05:13.513 --> 05:15.390
And bad luck to us all.

05:27.928 --> 05:29.339
Chopper at 2 o'clock!

05:54.187 --> 05:55.894
Bo-Dai to group.

05:55.956 --> 05:58.527
I'm in the groove and slamming the door.

05:59.426 --> 06:01.167
Raise the gauntlet.

06:10.971 --> 06:12.712
5 choppers, straight ahead.

06:35.328 --> 06:37.205
The sucker is still coming in.

06:37.264 --> 06:39.744
Ready to fire in sequence, my mark.

06:39.799 --> 06:41.779
No, no, cease fire!

06:42.402 --> 06:44.814
This jockey’s got guts. He's mine.

06:45.138 --> 06:47.618
Stay out of this, kids. All of you.

06:48.742 --> 06:50.517
Aerial combat, Reed.

06:51.011 --> 06:52.922
Not high-tech slaughter.

07:21.441 --> 07:22.579
I'm hit!

07:23.710 --> 07:25.417
Come on, kid, get out.

07:28.748 --> 07:30.125
Bailing out.

07:35.689 --> 07:36.895
Come on!

07:38.992 --> 07:40.096
Yeah.

07:42.662 --> 07:46.303
Steadman, Delaney, get down
there and make sure he's okay.

07:46.433 --> 07:49.573
Bring him back to the base, We'll
wine and dine him tonight.

07:50.937 --> 07:53.076
He can play POW tomorrow.

07:57.177 --> 07:59.157
Okay, Reed, take over.

08:26.039 --> 08:28.952
Yesterday, Seko Logana's
North Limbawe Air Force

08:29.009 --> 08:31.455
attempted to knock out the
South's new missile sites.

08:31.511 --> 08:33.354
They're a couple of antique Corsairs.

08:33.413 --> 08:36.417
The one shortage the North
doesn't have is guts.

08:36.482 --> 08:39.760
But they'll need more than guts
to eliminate those missiles.

08:40.886 --> 08:42.594
Inter-range ballistic.

08:42.655 --> 08:45.659
They're not in place yet, but very soon.

08:46.860 --> 08:49.033
How close to ready are those silos?

08:49.095 --> 08:53.043
72 hours. Our reports indicate
that once they are operational,

08:53.400 --> 08:56.347
South Limbawe will use
them to attack the North.

08:56.436 --> 08:58.575
And we can't let that happen.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.186
General Ali Butami.

09:06.246 --> 09:08.157
Soviet-trained and educated.

09:08.415 --> 09:11.521
The real power behind
South Limbawe's President.

09:12.719 --> 09:14.221
Harold Ngomo.

09:14.354 --> 09:16.391
He's your basic figurehead statesman,

09:16.523 --> 09:18.560
but very popular with the people.

09:18.925 --> 09:20.336
Former history professor.

09:20.393 --> 09:23.169
A nice guy with a Hitler calling the shots.

09:24.798 --> 09:27.677
Seko Logana, North Limbawe's President,

09:27.734 --> 09:29.304
and his wife, Lea.

09:30.804 --> 09:31.942
He's been in contact with…

09:32.005 --> 09:33.382
To tell you the truth, honey,

09:33.440 --> 09:36.785
politics and crisis are beginning
to bore the hell out of me.

09:36.843 --> 09:40.188
Yeah, Dominic's right. You're just
setting us up for the big pitch.

09:40.246 --> 09:41.725
Sure.

09:41.781 --> 09:45.752
The good guys in the North are on
the side of apple pie and baseball,

09:45.819 --> 09:47.389
and the bad guys in the South…

09:47.454 --> 09:50.526
Are sipping vodka, waiting to
push all the wrong buttons.

09:50.590 --> 09:52.467
I haven't asked you to do anything.

09:52.525 --> 09:55.802
Don't bother, 'cause the answer is no.

09:55.862 --> 09:58.741
I haven't asked because I didn't
think it would be necessary

09:58.798 --> 10:00.744
once you saw this

10:02.068 --> 10:03.138
photograph.

10:03.203 --> 10:04.443
Taken last week.

10:05.171 --> 10:09.347
The Commanding Officer of General
Butami's mercenary Helicopter Corps.

10:09.409 --> 10:12.151
That's Colonel Vidor. Marty Vidor.

10:12.645 --> 10:15.387
Colonel Martin James Vidor, to be precise.

10:15.715 --> 10:18.389
Your Commanding Officer in Southeast Asia.

10:18.785 --> 10:21.629
He calls himself Bo-Dai-Thung nowadays.

10:22.355 --> 10:24.392
Thought he was dead for sure.

10:25.358 --> 10:27.338
He went down in some heavy ground fire...

10:27.393 --> 10:28.463
Yes, he did.

10:28.528 --> 10:31.099
In the same operation as my brother.

10:34.367 --> 10:36.904
If anybody knows where Sin Jin is,

10:37.437 --> 10:38.575
he does.

10:58.424 --> 11:00.404
There's not enough to go around, Delaney.

11:00.460 --> 11:02.269
And I outrank you.

11:02.395 --> 11:04.306
There ain't no rank in this outfit, Reed.

11:04.364 --> 11:07.208
Yeah? Well, I'm pulling rank. Come on!

11:25.218 --> 11:26.925
Nice flying yesterday.

11:29.589 --> 11:31.865
Lighten up, Reed. It's a party.

11:32.325 --> 11:34.327
That goes for you too, sucker.

11:45.505 --> 11:49.112
Okay, you're right. I am drunk.

11:50.610 --> 11:52.112
Shot to hell,

11:52.745 --> 11:54.782
but not a drop of blood showing.

11:56.716 --> 11:58.423
That's not bad, Mamma?

11:59.319 --> 12:00.821
Right. Right.

12:00.887 --> 12:03.424
Maybe I should write my memoirs, Mamma?

12:03.690 --> 12:06.694
What do you think?
The Nine Lives of Marty Vidor,

12:06.826 --> 12:08.464
Professional soldier,

12:09.662 --> 12:11.107
leader of

12:12.765 --> 12:13.869
men,

12:15.101 --> 12:16.705
killer of brave,

12:19.105 --> 12:20.516
brave kids.

12:22.208 --> 12:24.188
It's high-tech slaughter.

12:26.546 --> 12:31.188
I want pure aerial combat when I get aced.

12:32.418 --> 12:34.830
Me against somebody as good as...

12:38.324 --> 12:39.701
as good as me.

12:41.728 --> 12:42.798
Chai?

12:46.299 --> 12:47.835
No tea, Mamma.

12:49.202 --> 12:50.374
Whiskey.

13:00.413 --> 13:01.790
MiG, 12 o’clock high.

13:01.848 --> 13:03.156
Got him.

13:03.216 --> 13:04.559
That's Bo-Dai's plane.

13:04.617 --> 13:05.925
All the better.

13:08.021 --> 13:09.500
I'm on your 6.

13:09.555 --> 13:11.592
Bo-Dai's mine. Stay out of it.

13:11.658 --> 13:14.070
1-on-1. That's what it's all about.

13:14.961 --> 13:17.908
Hey, String, what's this
Bo-Dai-Thung business,

13:17.964 --> 13:19.910
the name that Vidor's calling himself?

13:19.966 --> 13:22.810
Bo-Dai-Thung was a North Vietnamese flyer.

13:23.136 --> 13:24.672
The Colonel shot him down.

13:24.737 --> 13:26.546
The Colonel's chopper against his MiG.

13:26.973 --> 13:28.213
Head-on.

13:28.741 --> 13:29.913
Head-on?

13:30.510 --> 13:31.784
Mamma mia!

13:52.265 --> 13:54.472
Another request from West Germany.

13:54.534 --> 13:57.947
They want to establish a trade
mission in the capital.

13:58.604 --> 13:59.810
What else do they want?

13:59.872 --> 14:02.512
Agreements on imports, exports.

14:03.176 --> 14:05.486
That's another name for oil.

14:05.812 --> 14:07.553
That makes 6 contenders.

14:07.914 --> 14:11.760
The Russians, Japanese,
West Germany, the French,

14:12.518 --> 14:15.226
and now, of course, the Americans.

14:15.922 --> 14:18.459
It's amazing how much they can love you

14:18.524 --> 14:19.969
when you have something they want.

14:20.026 --> 14:22.302
And South Limbawe wants it most of all.

14:22.362 --> 14:24.069
Speaking of which,

14:24.130 --> 14:27.907
where is this miracle worker
from Archangel? He's late.

14:27.967 --> 14:29.605
It's a long trip. He'll be here.

14:30.536 --> 14:31.776
No doubt.

14:31.838 --> 14:34.876
Mercenaries are very dependable
when money's involved.

14:35.575 --> 14:39.387
Lea, I don't like it. I don't like it at all.

14:39.812 --> 14:42.725
Using outside forces for an African problem.

14:43.683 --> 14:47.290
It makes us no different than the
South and Butami's white killers.

14:47.353 --> 14:50.960
Yes, but I don't like the idea
of leaving your guard behind.

14:51.124 --> 14:54.401
Butami has tried to kill you
twice in as many months.

14:54.727 --> 14:56.536
You must understand, my dear.

14:56.596 --> 15:00.476
Less eyes to see, and less mouths to inform.

15:35.768 --> 15:39.011
And these, of course,
are machine guns, cannons.

15:39.439 --> 15:41.214
But I ask you, Mr. President,

15:41.274 --> 15:44.050
is she a beauty, or is she a beauty?

15:45.378 --> 15:47.051
And look at those lines.

15:47.146 --> 15:49.353
Yes, Mr. Santini, it's
very aesthetic, I'm sure.

15:49.415 --> 15:51.725
But can the aircraft do
everything you say it can?

15:51.784 --> 15:53.229
Absolutely, sir.

15:54.120 --> 15:55.428
May I ask you, sir?

15:55.488 --> 15:58.367
How much is the Firm paying you and Mr. Hawke

15:58.424 --> 16:00.529
for helping we poor natives?

16:01.160 --> 16:02.833
We're here because...

16:03.763 --> 16:05.606
Well, it's not costing you.

16:06.132 --> 16:07.406
Isn't it?

16:08.334 --> 16:10.336
So, Mr. Hawke is what you would call

16:10.403 --> 16:12.474
a seat-of-the-pants flyer, Mr. Santini?

16:14.774 --> 16:17.311
That's right, ma'am. I… I guess he is.

16:18.644 --> 16:20.624
He's also my best friend.

16:21.848 --> 16:25.193
Then, if nothing else,
Mr. Hawke is a very lucky man.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.615
She may look big, Mr. President,

16:49.675 --> 16:52.918
but this lady's actually very
light on her feet, right, Dom?

16:53.412 --> 16:55.949
Come on, give me a hand. Right this way, sir.

17:02.088 --> 17:04.465
Right here in the tail section, please.

17:06.058 --> 17:08.560
Is there something the matter, Mr. Hawke?

17:09.462 --> 17:12.671
Yes, sir, Mr. President. Absolutely.

17:13.299 --> 17:15.040
Just stay behind the tail, please.

17:15.101 --> 17:16.739
You folks stay right here.

17:16.801 --> 17:18.474
But, Mr. Hawke, please. What are you…

17:18.538 --> 17:20.449
Just get ready for the next demonstration.

17:20.506 --> 17:23.316
Why don't we stand up
against this tail over here?

17:23.376 --> 17:24.719
There we go.

17:35.888 --> 17:37.390
There you are.

17:51.437 --> 17:53.713
Yeah, he's out of range.

17:53.773 --> 17:55.252
We'll never catch him now.

17:55.308 --> 17:57.219
He's pretty fast on his feet.

17:57.276 --> 17:59.882
Fast on his feet? Of course.

17:59.946 --> 18:01.721
It must be his natural rhythm.

18:01.781 --> 18:03.522
Insensitive to pain.

18:07.420 --> 18:10.594
I'll be at Airwolf. It's
time to get out of here.

18:13.693 --> 18:16.640
Oh, Seko, you may as well
have called him a racist.

18:16.696 --> 18:17.674
I thought I did.

18:17.730 --> 18:20.336
Lea, I say what I feel when I feel it.

18:20.399 --> 18:22.811
We're here to help you, sir. You need our…

18:22.868 --> 18:25.109
We don't need your kind of help.

18:25.171 --> 18:28.550
You're right. None of us need
the wrong type of help.

18:28.608 --> 18:30.645
Mr. Santini, please.

18:31.277 --> 18:32.950
Now, Mr. Hawke is right.

18:33.012 --> 18:35.788
It is time for us to
leave. But we'll split up.

18:35.848 --> 18:38.522
Now, Lea, you will go with Mr. Santini.

18:38.884 --> 18:42.229
I will accompany Mr. Hawke to the
location that we discussed before,

18:42.288 --> 18:44.768
where both will meet in a couple of hours.

18:44.857 --> 18:46.359
Seko, kiss me.

18:52.098 --> 18:55.375
Mr. Santini, take good care of her.

18:56.235 --> 18:58.715
She is Limbawe's only crown jewel.

18:59.639 --> 19:01.710
Take care of yourself, Seko.

19:02.642 --> 19:05.145
I will let Mr. Hawke handle that chore.

19:33.406 --> 19:35.443
I apologized, damn it!

19:35.574 --> 19:37.645
Yes, you did, and I accepted.

19:37.710 --> 19:40.054
Never mind accepting it!

19:40.112 --> 19:41.819
Slow down, slow down, please!

19:47.386 --> 19:50.367
You did say you wanted
to see Airwolf do Mach 1.

19:50.423 --> 19:52.630
Yes, I've seen it now!

19:52.692 --> 19:55.696
I've seen it, I've felt it,
and I've had enough of it!

19:55.761 --> 19:57.104
Slow down!

20:01.701 --> 20:03.146
Slowing down.

20:13.412 --> 20:15.517
I'm sorry about that, Mr. President.

20:15.648 --> 20:17.787
Your apology is accepted.

20:20.986 --> 20:24.627
So, now that we have put this
aircraft through its paces,

20:24.690 --> 20:27.330
I think it's best we
proceed to our destination.

20:27.393 --> 20:29.373
It would be a little embarrassing if my wife

20:29.428 --> 20:31.772
arrived there before we did, don't you think?

20:36.836 --> 20:39.646
For the last 3 years, General Butami,

20:39.739 --> 20:42.515
you have dominated the Office of President

20:42.575 --> 20:44.987
with your advice and your views.

20:45.478 --> 20:47.981
I must take responsibility for that.

20:48.614 --> 20:53.120
And for the fact that what
President Logana has accused us of,

20:53.185 --> 20:54.493
is true.

20:55.254 --> 20:57.757
I know about the attack you're planning.

20:57.823 --> 21:00.804
I swore an oath to protect my country.

21:01.961 --> 21:04.032
I have done nothing to betray that oath.

21:04.096 --> 21:07.236
The offensive I've arranged
is absolutely foolproof.

21:07.366 --> 21:09.869
How can war be foolproof,

21:09.935 --> 21:12.381
if it takes a fool to start one, General?

21:12.438 --> 21:15.817
They started this war! Years ago.

21:17.510 --> 21:19.421
There will be no war.

21:19.478 --> 21:21.424
I will call a special session of Congress!

21:21.480 --> 21:23.391
There's not enough time, sir.

21:23.449 --> 21:25.360
The attack will take place.

21:26.252 --> 21:28.664
You were very useful when
we needed the missiles.

21:28.721 --> 21:32.100
But now, if you reveal our plan,

21:32.792 --> 21:34.635
the North will be alerted.

21:34.693 --> 21:35.694
So,

21:36.629 --> 21:39.838
I think it would be best if you remained here

21:41.333 --> 21:43.176
as our guest.

21:45.538 --> 21:46.812
Now, wait a minute, General…

21:46.872 --> 21:48.010
Sergeant.

21:49.341 --> 21:52.288
No stomach for change, Colonel?

21:55.614 --> 21:57.594
Where's the officer-for-hire?

21:59.118 --> 22:01.120
Oh, he's still here, General.

22:02.688 --> 22:05.965
And my stomach is none of your concern.

22:13.666 --> 22:17.011
Escort Mr. Ngomo

22:17.736 --> 22:20.808
to the guest quarters. Stay with him.

22:34.053 --> 22:36.192
You almost helped him, didn't you?

22:36.488 --> 22:38.934
I know it's only a small matter, General,

22:38.991 --> 22:41.096
but you could've informed
me that you were about to

22:41.160 --> 22:43.071
overthrow the government.

22:43.295 --> 22:46.799
Yes, well, I was inspired.

22:48.167 --> 22:50.374
Opportunity of the moment.

22:51.370 --> 22:55.785
Are you questioning my authority
to be inspired, Colonel?

22:56.242 --> 22:59.621
I never question anything that
comes from the barrel of a gun.

23:00.546 --> 23:03.550
Or a bottle, Colonel?

23:08.354 --> 23:11.335
The country needs us now more than ever.

23:11.790 --> 23:13.861
Don't fail me, Vidor.

23:13.926 --> 23:15.906
Perish the thought, General.

23:20.199 --> 23:22.645
I'm returning to the missile site.

23:22.902 --> 23:25.178
Your Helicopter Corps will be at maneuvers?

23:25.237 --> 23:26.875
Yes, as planned.

23:27.273 --> 23:29.184
We need to get practice for the boys.

23:29.241 --> 23:31.084
Tomorrow is the big show.

23:31.677 --> 23:34.157
I'll see you soon, Mr. President.

23:35.281 --> 23:36.351
What?

23:39.418 --> 23:40.522
Oh, yes.

23:41.587 --> 23:42.691
By the way.

23:42.755 --> 23:45.599
Did I tell you I managed to
talk our Eastern Bloc friends

23:45.658 --> 23:47.763
into testing their new nerve gas?

23:47.826 --> 23:51.000
It's being incorporated
into the missile warheads

23:51.063 --> 23:52.440
even as we speak.

23:52.698 --> 23:53.972
Excellent idea, eh?

23:54.033 --> 23:55.603
Yes. Excellent.

23:56.235 --> 23:58.977
And yet another button for you to push?

24:01.373 --> 24:03.717
Very good. I like that.

24:03.876 --> 24:06.823
Yes, indeed.

24:09.048 --> 24:10.288
Indeed.

24:54.893 --> 24:57.567
This service road leads
directly to the border.

24:57.629 --> 24:59.540
10 miles on the other side is the base

24:59.598 --> 25:02.875
from which Colonel Bo-Dai and his
helicopters will attack us.

25:02.935 --> 25:04.937
Unless you can stop them.

25:05.237 --> 25:07.012
Well, I'll give it a try.

25:07.439 --> 25:10.010
I think I need a better guarantee than that.

25:10.876 --> 25:14.050
Mr. President, guarantees
come with washing machines.

25:14.113 --> 25:16.855
Well yes, I understand, but I
think I would feel much better

25:16.915 --> 25:19.088
if my own man was flying Airwolf.

25:20.252 --> 25:21.959
If you had one that could.

25:22.554 --> 25:24.591
Or if I had my own Airwolf.

25:25.758 --> 25:28.068
I could take it, if I wanted to.

25:29.261 --> 25:30.899
You and who else?

25:39.538 --> 25:40.915
Perhaps them.

26:05.531 --> 26:06.976
Tell them to stop.

26:07.099 --> 26:08.578
And why should I do that?

26:09.401 --> 26:11.904
This is a detonating device. Electronic.

26:11.970 --> 26:14.143
I press this button, Airwolf goes up.

26:16.108 --> 26:19.248
Mr. Hawke, these men are here to guard us

26:19.445 --> 26:22.051
and to protect your precious Airwolf.

26:28.554 --> 26:30.090
Your detonator?

26:37.096 --> 26:39.406
But I've never played mercenary.

26:40.966 --> 26:43.503
Just let that old bad side out, Dom.

26:43.769 --> 26:47.808
What bad side? I don't have any
bad side. I mean, I'm a nice guy.

26:47.873 --> 26:50.683
Although I do have kind of a bad temper.

26:54.046 --> 26:55.787
Vidor's field is just ahead.

26:55.848 --> 26:57.657
But I got something else, String.

26:57.716 --> 26:59.286
A few miles south.

26:59.485 --> 27:01.761
The sonic sensors are reacting.

27:01.820 --> 27:03.527
Someone's dropping heavy ordnance.

27:03.589 --> 27:05.034
Practice.

27:05.190 --> 27:07.864
The Colonel always believed in staying sharp.

27:09.161 --> 27:11.437
And I believe in staying alive, String.

27:11.497 --> 27:14.341
So, don't even think, what I
know you're thinking of.

27:16.935 --> 27:18.209
Hell!

27:47.199 --> 27:48.507
Commander to group.

27:48.567 --> 27:50.945
That was lousy, boys. Very lousy.

27:51.036 --> 27:52.379
Just one hit.

27:52.437 --> 27:54.781
All right, guys, let's make another run.

27:54.840 --> 27:57.013
Radar says they've got a contact.

27:57.075 --> 27:58.884
A jet, supersonic.

28:30.943 --> 28:32.354
Colonel Vidor,

28:36.481 --> 28:38.483
we have met the enemy.

28:38.550 --> 28:39.961
And they are us.

28:42.354 --> 28:43.890
Captain Hawke.

29:03.575 --> 29:05.452
Captain Hawke reporting

29:06.545 --> 29:08.855
with a little present for the Colonel.

29:09.881 --> 29:13.192
Yeah, I see it. I just don't believe it.

29:14.987 --> 29:17.968
You're not the type for this kind of business.

29:19.057 --> 29:20.365
And you are?

29:21.660 --> 29:23.367
I've been working at it.

29:24.196 --> 29:26.335
I know, that's why I'm here.

29:27.633 --> 29:29.579
I want a piece of the action.

29:32.604 --> 29:34.515
Okay, you got it.

29:37.776 --> 29:38.948
Colonel.

29:39.011 --> 29:40.547
It's good to see you, Hawke.

29:41.713 --> 29:43.954
Boys, this is Captain Hawke.

29:45.183 --> 29:48.027
The second best chopper pilot in the world.

29:48.120 --> 29:49.690
Let's get a drink.

29:52.824 --> 29:54.064
Ice.

29:56.261 --> 29:58.104
Hard to come by down here.

29:59.231 --> 30:00.608
You earn it.

30:01.266 --> 30:02.370
Sometimes.

30:03.468 --> 30:06.540
We definitely earned our
perks in Nam, didn't we?

30:06.605 --> 30:08.175
That's for sure.

30:11.243 --> 30:12.244
Colonel,

30:13.845 --> 30:15.916
what do you know of Sin Jin?

30:16.682 --> 30:18.025
Wasn't he repatriated?

30:18.150 --> 30:19.493
Still an MIA.

30:22.287 --> 30:25.063
I thought you might know
something. You went down with him.

30:25.123 --> 30:29.401
I saw his ship go down, but, then
I took that SAM in the aft rotor

30:30.329 --> 30:32.331
and down I went, right into the arms of

30:32.464 --> 30:34.501
the, North Vietnamese People's Army.

30:36.335 --> 30:37.837
I never saw Sin Jin.

30:43.508 --> 30:46.489
Remember the day we brought old Bo-Dai down?

30:47.446 --> 30:49.119
What do you mean "we"?

30:49.715 --> 30:51.456
You told us all to stay out of it.

30:51.583 --> 30:53.358
I was just an observer.

30:53.418 --> 30:56.627
I wish I had 50 observers like you.

30:57.656 --> 30:59.829
Old Bo-Dai-Thung could not believe

30:59.891 --> 31:01.996
anyone would go right at him like that.

31:02.094 --> 31:04.574
Least of all an imperialistic Yankee.

31:04.730 --> 31:06.004
He paid for it.

31:06.832 --> 31:08.209
Yeah, he did.

31:09.167 --> 31:11.807
I'm glad I could go down and
pick up his helmet, though.

31:11.870 --> 31:13.440
It's a good reminder.

31:14.072 --> 31:16.382
How come you never went home?

31:16.441 --> 31:18.079
The squadron was my home.

31:18.143 --> 31:20.282
And America had no war.

31:20.912 --> 31:24.450
Besides, I kind of liked the idea
of being dead. Starting over.

31:24.649 --> 31:26.060
A new chance.

31:26.118 --> 31:28.724
I came down to Limbawe during the war.

31:29.488 --> 31:31.434
And I've been here ever since.

31:32.724 --> 31:34.863
It pays well.

31:35.594 --> 31:38.507
What about you? For
starters, nothing paid well.

31:42.868 --> 31:44.575
What's going on out there?

31:50.809 --> 31:52.083
Firing squad.

31:52.844 --> 31:55.723
The former President of
this embattled country.

31:56.681 --> 31:58.661
Does that bother you, Captain?

32:01.753 --> 32:04.393
This isn't the good old US of A, you know.

32:04.456 --> 32:07.232
North and South Limbawe
are emerging countries.

32:07.926 --> 32:10.463
And birth is never an easy process.

32:11.930 --> 32:14.638
Death is always a hell of a lot easier.

32:18.937 --> 32:20.348
Well,

32:20.439 --> 32:23.477
answer my question. Does
that, out there, bother you?

32:27.145 --> 32:28.783
I came for the money.

32:28.947 --> 32:30.290
I don't buy that for a second!

32:30.415 --> 32:31.758
I know you, remember!?

32:31.817 --> 32:33.160
And I know you!

32:35.120 --> 32:36.793
There's still time.

32:38.957 --> 32:41.130
Time for what?

32:57.809 --> 32:59.846
There is no time, Captain.

33:00.412 --> 33:01.857
No time at all.

33:02.380 --> 33:03.415
Now,

33:03.482 --> 33:06.656
you tell me why I should risk
what I've got here for you.

33:06.718 --> 33:08.527
I can score big. Get out of the business…

33:08.587 --> 33:11.193
Tomorrow is not gonna be any
different for either of us.

33:11.256 --> 33:14.294
It's just a matter of who
we're doing it for and why.

33:22.400 --> 33:24.607
My faith's restored, Colonel.

33:25.003 --> 33:28.644
I should have known you'd see through
these recruits and take action.

33:28.707 --> 33:31.017
Yeah, we all have our moments of doubt.

33:31.276 --> 33:35.588
General, why waste a perfectly
good firing squad on one traitor?

33:37.749 --> 33:39.251
Excellent idea.

33:52.364 --> 33:55.208
I won't miss tomorrow, up there.

33:55.901 --> 33:57.175
I won't fight you.

33:57.235 --> 33:59.010
Yeah, you will. You won't have any choice.

33:59.070 --> 34:00.174
Now get out of here.

34:00.238 --> 34:02.184
Take Ngomo with you. Move!

34:16.621 --> 34:19.101
Get him in that ship. Get it started.

34:27.032 --> 34:29.273
Dom, go back. Get it started.

34:31.503 --> 34:33.176
Come on, kid. Get up.

34:46.985 --> 34:48.259
Okay, Dom. I got it.

34:48.386 --> 34:49.694
You got nothing. You're hit.

34:49.754 --> 34:50.994
I'm okay.

35:15.947 --> 35:19.952
Don't worry, General, your soldier-for-hire
will take care of everything.

35:20.819 --> 35:23.299
Shame they got the President, though.

35:37.836 --> 35:39.679
Okay, kiddies. Nothing changes.

35:39.738 --> 35:43.276
All we gotta do is get that
high-tech slick of Hawke's,

35:43.375 --> 35:48.256
blow it out of the air, and then
Butami can push his buttons.

35:49.381 --> 35:52.225
And tomorrow we all get our big, fat bonuses.

35:52.283 --> 35:54.627
All right!

35:54.686 --> 35:57.690
I have really trained you
well, haven't I, Reed?

35:58.490 --> 35:59.764
All of you.

36:21.046 --> 36:23.219
I may have been ignorant of the intricacies

36:23.281 --> 36:24.817
of political power,

36:25.183 --> 36:26.924
but I was never dishonest.

36:27.285 --> 36:29.424
Politically, I am opposed to you.

36:29.888 --> 36:32.926
That does not mean I wish
to face you with a weapon.

36:33.391 --> 36:35.769
Then perhaps I'm dealing with a coward.

36:36.261 --> 36:38.263
It was not I, who was willing to sacrifice

36:38.329 --> 36:40.036
his wife for peace.

36:40.265 --> 36:42.370
I want no one to die.

36:42.734 --> 36:44.611
Guns do not bring peace.

36:45.303 --> 36:47.010
They bring bigger guns.

36:47.405 --> 36:49.681
Such as your monster helicopter.

36:49.974 --> 36:51.578
One machine, 2 men,

36:51.643 --> 36:53.554
against your helicopter force?

36:54.245 --> 36:56.589
I would order them out
of the country immediately,

36:56.648 --> 36:58.958
if I could be sure they're not needed.

37:01.319 --> 37:03.890
Welcome back to the world of the living.

37:03.955 --> 37:05.366
Is the bullet still in there?

37:05.423 --> 37:08.063
No, passed through. You're lucky.

37:08.293 --> 37:09.897
How do you feel?

37:11.229 --> 37:13.709
How do I look?

37:13.765 --> 37:17.941
Like you've been shot, lost a lot
of blood, and have a raging fever.

37:19.404 --> 37:21.577
That's just what I feel like.

37:21.873 --> 37:23.784
...people I represent are not.

37:24.375 --> 37:25.683
They would never accept you...

37:25.744 --> 37:27.485
What's going on in there?

37:27.545 --> 37:29.491
Politics.

37:29.614 --> 37:33.323
It was quite a shock when President
Ngomo stepped out of Airwolf.

37:34.252 --> 37:38.928
For the first time since I've known
him, Seko was at a loss for words.

37:38.990 --> 37:41.231
We have too many differences.

37:41.292 --> 37:42.794
Sounds like he got his words back.

37:42.861 --> 37:44.340
With a vengeance.

37:44.395 --> 37:46.170
He's a great leader.

37:46.798 --> 37:48.402
Maybe so.

37:48.533 --> 37:50.535
How is he in the human being department?

37:52.403 --> 37:56.818
I'll tell him you've regained
consciousness and the use of your tongue.

37:59.711 --> 38:01.054
I'm sorry.

38:04.182 --> 38:05.559
I'm feeling better.

38:05.617 --> 38:07.426
That's what Seko would say.

38:07.485 --> 38:10.125
And neither one of you are good liars.

38:11.456 --> 38:13.834
Did my husband apologize to you?

38:15.160 --> 38:16.161
Yes.

38:16.227 --> 38:20.437
You see? He's a leader and a human being.

38:24.969 --> 38:26.505
Wanna give me a hand?

38:33.311 --> 38:36.451
I really do feel better.

38:36.514 --> 38:39.256
Well, laughter's supposed
to do that, you know.

38:43.021 --> 38:44.261
And tears?

38:44.622 --> 38:45.862
Yes.

38:46.891 --> 38:48.768
Laughter and tears both.

38:57.735 --> 39:01.205
You and I should live a long time, Mr. Hawke.

39:06.277 --> 39:07.756
- It hurts.
- What?

39:07.812 --> 39:09.314
I can't laugh.

39:12.851 --> 39:15.229
Glad to see you up and about, Hawke.

39:17.856 --> 39:21.929
President Ngomo has agreed to form
a coalition government with me.

39:22.493 --> 39:23.631
But we need your help.

39:23.695 --> 39:24.935
Lea, if you don't mind.

39:24.996 --> 39:26.976
Of course not, Seko.

39:29.400 --> 39:31.676
Seko, it's wonderful.

39:31.736 --> 39:34.649
For the first time, this country
could really be united.

39:34.706 --> 39:36.811
My dear, there's the slight matter

39:36.875 --> 39:38.752
of a war that must be stopped.

39:38.810 --> 39:39.914
Sir.

39:40.078 --> 39:42.080
Seko, how long have you been standing there?

39:42.146 --> 39:44.285
A little too long, I'm afraid.

39:44.983 --> 39:46.428
But something very interesting happened.

39:46.784 --> 39:47.990
What's that?

39:48.052 --> 39:49.793
I saw my wife with another man.

39:49.854 --> 39:51.231
A white man.

39:51.823 --> 39:54.167
But instead of getting angry,

39:54.792 --> 39:57.329
I put myself inside both your skins.

39:58.463 --> 40:00.909
And I knew then that as you, Hawke,

40:01.366 --> 40:04.142
I was too much of a man to betray a friend.

40:05.303 --> 40:07.476
And as you, my dearest love,

40:08.506 --> 40:11.112
I knew that I love Seko too much.

40:12.010 --> 40:13.717
How's that for ego?

40:16.814 --> 40:18.794
Now, now, now. Now, now.

40:19.918 --> 40:24.492
Remember, we must be
heroes, and stop this war.

40:36.734 --> 40:37.678
How you feeling?

40:37.735 --> 40:38.907
I'll live.

40:38.970 --> 40:40.608
That's debatable.

40:41.105 --> 40:43.915
We've got to get those missiles. Now.

40:44.309 --> 40:47.347
And Vidor? What're you going
to do about the Colonel?

40:50.481 --> 40:51.687
String.

40:51.916 --> 40:56.387
I know he was your friend
before, but he's gone bad.

40:57.255 --> 40:59.963
All these years doing
these kind of things...

41:00.024 --> 41:01.025
That...

41:01.626 --> 41:04.698
He's sick inside. I've seen
them like that before,

41:04.829 --> 41:07.867
their guts twisted like… like barbed wire.

41:08.633 --> 41:11.512
Everyday it twists a
little tighter, and tighter.

41:32.623 --> 41:34.068
That's his gunship.

41:48.439 --> 41:51.010
Hand-tossed mortars. It's an old Nam trick.

41:51.075 --> 41:52.213
Lea!

42:13.564 --> 42:15.271
I'm hit. Seko.

42:15.333 --> 42:19.440
It's all right. It'll be all right.
It'll be all right, Lea.

42:19.670 --> 42:22.310
Quick, Lieutenant, a doctor! Get a doctor!

42:55.139 --> 42:56.948
We're across the demarcation line.

42:57.008 --> 42:58.783
He's still ahead of us.

42:59.177 --> 43:00.884
Pretty as you please. Playing.

43:01.012 --> 43:02.719
He wants us to catch up with him.

43:03.114 --> 43:04.525
And then he'll play his wild card.

43:04.649 --> 43:06.060
I know.

43:06.584 --> 43:07.790
Well?

43:07.852 --> 43:09.024
Well what?

43:11.189 --> 43:12.463
Nothing.

43:13.191 --> 43:15.330
3,000 meters and closing.

43:15.393 --> 43:17.873
Low hills. Nothing else on the scope yet.

43:23.267 --> 43:25.213
10 seconds from gauntlet.

43:26.003 --> 43:28.108
And here comes another sucker.

43:28.473 --> 43:31.181
No, Reed, I'm the sucker.

43:32.310 --> 43:33.812
And so are you.

43:39.450 --> 43:42.363
Bo-Dai to group. Daddy's in the groove.

43:43.287 --> 43:44.459
Stand by.

43:49.660 --> 43:52.698
He's just about past those
hills, picking up speed.

43:52.763 --> 43:54.037
Ambush time.

43:54.165 --> 43:55.473
No doubt about it.

43:57.268 --> 43:59.976
Raise the gauntlet, kids, and aim straight.

44:00.037 --> 44:02.017
Daddy's slamming the door.

44:03.274 --> 44:04.514
General Butami.

44:07.245 --> 44:08.451
Butami here.

44:08.980 --> 44:12.086
This is where you get your
money's worth, sweetheart.

44:12.250 --> 44:13.786
With interest.

44:23.828 --> 44:25.239
There they are.

44:25.296 --> 44:26.832
I have a visual.

45:42.873 --> 45:45.877
So much for the button-pushers, Hawke?

45:46.777 --> 45:48.450
Try to set her down, Colonel.

45:48.512 --> 45:52.358
Nah, it's no use. It's
gone on too long anyway.

45:53.184 --> 45:56.324
Games. All games.

45:57.054 --> 45:58.931
Playing soldier of fortune.

46:00.091 --> 46:03.163
Playing you. It's crazy.

46:05.162 --> 46:08.700
You wanna know the truth,
Hawke, the crazy, rotten truth?

46:10.067 --> 46:11.808
I know where Sin Jin is!

46:31.856 --> 46:33.836
Vidor was insane, damn it!

46:33.891 --> 46:36.064
The man didn't know anything about Sin Jin.

46:36.661 --> 46:38.163
What's your evidence?

46:38.229 --> 46:39.173
Me.

46:39.230 --> 46:40.140
You?

46:40.197 --> 46:43.235
Yes. I'd rather believe
I led you into all this

46:43.301 --> 46:45.076
knowing Vidor had no information

46:45.136 --> 46:47.047
than to think that we might have lost a clue

46:47.104 --> 46:50.381
that would finally and
irrevocably get you off my back.

46:51.342 --> 46:52.548
See you.

46:54.779 --> 46:56.190
I almost forgot.

46:56.247 --> 46:59.660
I came here to give you your
unofficial report on Limbawe.

46:59.717 --> 47:01.788
Just what we need.

47:03.654 --> 47:06.658
The coalition government
is still holding very well.

47:06.724 --> 47:09.000
Especially since the death of Butami.

47:09.060 --> 47:12.598
Seko and Ngomo are even friends,
in a manner of speaking.

47:13.364 --> 47:14.968
And Mrs. Logana?

47:16.233 --> 47:20.181
She's… fine. A national heroine.

47:22.173 --> 47:23.675
She sends her love.

47:30.114 --> 47:31.422
And this.

47:35.786 --> 47:38.494
Well, here's to Mrs. Lea Logana,

47:41.158 --> 47:42.660
all those who survived,

47:43.728 --> 47:45.139
and those who didn't.
