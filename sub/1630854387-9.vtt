You okay, hon?

00:32.449 --> 00:33.283
[sighs]

00:35.285 --> 00:36.327
What's your name?

00:38.496 --> 00:39.831
Garfield Logan.

00:41.207 --> 00:43.460
Garfield? Like the cat?

00:43.460 --> 00:45.670
I love that cat.

00:45.670 --> 00:48.798
My name's Kris.
I take care of the gorillas.

00:50.925 --> 00:52.552

00:55.972 --> 00:57.599
Do you like
gorillas, Garfield?

00:59.309 --> 01:02.020
Okay. You just sit here
and watch them a minute.

01:03.563 --> 01:05.315
[breathing heavily]
I don't wanna be alone.

01:06.941 --> 01:09.569
You're gonna have to be, okay?

01:09.569 --> 01:12.864
I need to go
make an announcement
so we can find your parents.

01:12.864 --> 01:14.699
I'm sure they're
as worried as you are.

01:17.535 --> 01:19.287
I'll be right back, sweetie.

[creature growls]

03:22.827 --> 03:23.786
What is that?

03:25.330 --> 03:28.833
Some loyal friends
working together.

03:28.833 --> 03:30.752
[Gar] "Friends?"

03:30.752 --> 03:32.253
Did he frighten you?

03:33.087 --> 03:34.964
A lion and a bat.

They are hungry,
so they go hunt.

03:58.363 --> 04:01.616
Ah, yes. And you?
Are you hungry?

04:04.994 --> 04:05.870
[Gar] Who are you?

04:08.331 --> 04:09.791
Where am I?

04:09.791 --> 04:12.085
[Dominic] You are atop
Mount Kilimanjaro.

04:14.712 --> 04:17.131
I pulled you here.
Out of The Red.

04:18.549 --> 04:19.801
The Red?

04:19.801 --> 04:22.929
The truth.
That is what
and who I am.

04:24.430 --> 04:25.598
Where are my friends?

04:25.598 --> 04:27.308
Who are you?

04:27.308 --> 04:29.143
[Dominic] I am
like you, my friend.

04:29.143 --> 04:33.314
I am one
with all beasts
who breathe and bleed.

04:35.525 --> 04:36.359
I...

04:38.695 --> 04:40.321
am your freedom.

05:13.104 --> 05:17.108
The last thing I remember,
I was with my friends,

05:18.192 --> 05:19.861
facing the end, I guess...

05:21.654 --> 05:22.905
Then...

05:22.905 --> 05:24.699
[thrumming]

05:24.699 --> 05:25.867
Take me to The Red.

05:33.291 --> 05:34.167
What happened?

05:37.462 --> 05:39.213
You did what I told you to.

05:40.131 --> 05:41.632
You saved yourself.

05:47.305 --> 05:48.181
Then...

05:52.810 --> 05:54.187
I brought you here.

05:56.314 --> 05:57.523
Where are the Titans?

05:59.025 --> 06:00.026
I do not know.

06:02.111 --> 06:03.154
[mumbles]

06:05.448 --> 06:06.282
Come.

06:12.580 --> 06:15.708
Try some. Mmm.

06:15.708 --> 06:19.420
If you brought me here,
you can take me back.

06:19.420 --> 06:21.464
I'm a very good cook.

06:21.464 --> 06:22.924
I need to go home.

06:26.469 --> 06:27.762

06:32.725 --> 06:34.769
[shouts] Take me to The Red!

06:42.026 --> 06:42.860
[grunts]

06:45.154 --> 06:46.155
Why isn't it working?

06:46.155 --> 06:49.075
[sighs] You need your strength.

06:49.909 --> 06:51.077
You are famished.

06:52.370 --> 06:53.621
I can feel it.

06:55.873 --> 06:57.542
Now, sit.

06:57.542 --> 06:58.960
Eat what I offer you.

07:03.089 --> 07:04.132
Send me back.

07:05.675 --> 07:08.594
Only you can find your way
back through The Red.

07:10.388 --> 07:12.265
And what exactly is The Red?

07:15.226 --> 07:20.398
It is a force that connects
and pervades all animal life

07:20.398 --> 07:24.277
in this universe
and many others.

07:25.570 --> 07:27.029
A place fully alive,

07:27.029 --> 07:30.825
one that every
beating heart flows into.

07:30.825 --> 07:36.205
Only a chosen few
can tap into its raw power.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.378
The Green Plague
that killed your parents,

07:42.378 --> 07:44.088
also it changed you.

07:45.256 --> 07:48.342
That disease didn't change me.

07:49.510 --> 07:51.220
A lunatic called the Chief did.

07:52.430 --> 07:53.681
Dr. Niles Caulder...

07:54.849 --> 07:57.059
cured me of the Green Plague.

07:58.311 --> 07:59.896
I was its only survivor.

08:01.314 --> 08:02.273
I know.

08:04.942 --> 08:07.403
Sakutia killed my family, too.

08:09.280 --> 08:10.823
My sister and her children.

08:27.840 --> 08:28.716
I'm sorry.

08:30.635 --> 08:34.055
The outbreak took those
we love the most from us.

08:35.640 --> 08:37.308
That is why I brought you here.

08:38.267 --> 08:41.520
Our shared grief fuels us.

09:04.085 --> 09:05.419
I need your help.

09:13.261 --> 09:14.136
[Gar] Listen...

09:16.138 --> 09:18.557
We all have problems
these days, man, I--

09:18.557 --> 09:22.270
And I'm sure
yours are important.

09:22.270 --> 09:25.773
And if I can help you
in the future, I will.

09:27.525 --> 09:29.902
But right now,
I need to get
back to my friends.

09:33.364 --> 09:36.492
You have no idea
the evil we've been up against.

09:36.492 --> 09:40.246
Blood moons,
curses, demons. I...

09:42.873 --> 09:46.669
It may be
a matter of life and death
that I get back to my friends.

09:47.712 --> 09:50.965
Maybe for the entire world.

09:50.965 --> 09:54.760
You do not yet know
what truly threatens the world.

09:55.845 --> 09:57.305

- [Dominic] No.

10:09.817 --> 10:10.735
Stay.

10:10.735 --> 10:12.903
- [thuds]
- [gasps]

10:12.903 --> 10:15.031
- [security guard groans] No!
- [bone snaps]

10:19.577 --> 10:21.495

- [security guard 2] Wait!

10:21.495 --> 10:23.289
- [thuds]
- [screams]

10:34.675 --> 10:36.135
[Dominic breathing heavily]

10:46.479 --> 10:47.772
Who were those guys?

10:47.772 --> 10:51.734
[Dominic] Men who
did not belong in my domain.

10:51.734 --> 10:54.070
They knew I sought to end them,

10:55.654 --> 10:57.448
so they struck first.

11:02.203 --> 11:05.539
When I wear
the helmet of The Beast,

11:08.167 --> 11:11.545
I can hear the apes
they took from the jungles...

11:12.880 --> 11:13.714
screaming.

11:13.714 --> 11:15.299
[apes screaming]

[door creaking]

11:16.717 --> 11:19.136

of their cages.</i>

11:20.012 --> 11:21.055
[door opens]

11:21.055 --> 11:22.723
<i>They are infected now.</i>

11:25.267 --> 11:26.727
<i>Dying.</i>

11:26.727 --> 11:27.895
[Dr. Myers] Keep her breathing.

11:29.605 --> 11:30.439
But Dr. Myers--

11:30.439 --> 11:33.484
I need the data. Scalpel.

11:33.484 --> 11:36.195
[Dominic] <i>Dissected while
still alive.</i>

11:37.154 --> 11:38.447
[ape growls]

11:38.447 --> 11:39.949
Put some tape over its mouth

11:39.949 --> 11:41.992
- to shut it up, for God's sake.
- [ape groans]

11:48.791 --> 11:50.584
I need to free the apes

11:50.584 --> 11:53.295
and burn their lab
to the ground.

11:56.006 --> 11:59.802
The disease that killed
my sister and her children,

12:01.595 --> 12:05.057
your parents,
and dozens of others,

12:06.267 --> 12:09.437
it came
from this same lab, Gar.

12:10.354 --> 12:11.939
What?

12:11.939 --> 12:15.901
It is finally
time for us to get
justice for our families.

12:17.653 --> 12:21.449
This is our sacred mission.

12:23.284 --> 12:25.286
You know so much about me.

12:26.704 --> 12:29.665
Are you gonna
tell me something about you?

12:32.501 --> 12:33.335
[grunts]

12:40.176 --> 12:43.721
I was once Dominic Mndawe.

12:45.055 --> 12:48.517
But the day Mike Maxwell
gave me this helmet,

12:48.517 --> 12:50.811
there was only Freedom Beast.

12:57.443 --> 12:59.904
Beyond tying me to The Red,

12:59.904 --> 13:01.489
this ancient helm

13:02.281 --> 13:04.825
prolonged my lifespan.

13:04.825 --> 13:07.161
It gave me strength, stamina,

13:07.161 --> 13:11.624
and the ability
to fuse two creatures
into one super-hybrid.

13:13.292 --> 13:14.585
Weirdest power ever.

13:18.839 --> 13:21.675
The legend of The Beast

13:21.675 --> 13:26.096
goes back
as far as the story
of Mkunare and Kanyanga.

13:26.096 --> 13:31.227
Each one of us
protected our time
as best we could

13:31.227 --> 13:33.187
with the tools we were given.

13:38.859 --> 13:40.945
But you need no helmet.

13:41.946 --> 13:44.198
You are different from us.

13:44.198 --> 13:46.575
From Animal Man, or Vixen,

13:46.575 --> 13:48.911
or the others tied to The Red.

13:50.162 --> 13:52.122
You can do more than them, Gar.

13:52.873 --> 13:53.832
Than me.

13:57.169 --> 14:00.172
I brought you here
to show you that.

14:00.172 --> 14:04.718
To free your mind
of the cage society puts it in.

14:09.056 --> 14:12.685
If I'm more
connected to The Red
than anybody else,

14:14.436 --> 14:17.356
why is it that I only turn
into green animals?

14:20.317 --> 14:25.239
Your favorite color
is green, no?

14:25.239 --> 14:28.742
Yeah, I mean, [chuckles]
it's been that way ever
since I was a kid.

14:28.742 --> 14:32.496
Your influence
over The Red is astounding.

14:36.959 --> 14:37.918
Drink this.

14:39.837 --> 14:43.424
[chuckles]
What does it do?
Make me grow or shrink?

14:45.843 --> 14:46.969
A bit of both.

14:48.137 --> 14:49.346
It destroys you.

14:50.848 --> 14:54.101
See your truth, stop this lab,

14:54.935 --> 14:56.437
and you will travel back

14:56.437 --> 15:00.065
through The Red
on your own in moments.

15:06.822 --> 15:07.656
Now.

15:12.578 --> 15:13.621
Let it begin.

15:14.204 --> 15:15.205

How long does it take to begin?

15:52.076 --> 15:54.787
[chuckling] How long
does it take to begin?

15:54.787 --> 15:56.622
How long is it
gonna take to begin?

15:56.622 --> 15:58.874
[shouting] How long
does it take to begin?

15:58.874 --> 16:01.418

does it take to begin?

16:01.418 --> 16:02.670
How long does it take to begin?

How long

Where are we going?

17:02.354 --> 17:03.439
I don't know.

17:03.439 --> 17:04.690
[Rachel] Yes, you do.

17:04.690 --> 17:06.567
You are in the
driver's seat this time.

17:08.277 --> 17:09.111
No.

17:10.320 --> 17:11.572
Where's Dick?

17:11.572 --> 17:12.614

17:14.324 --> 17:16.076
Now that we're all here,

17:16.076 --> 17:18.537

some tunes?

17:19.705 --> 17:22.166

17:22.166 --> 17:24.668
You've always
followed everybody else, Gar.
