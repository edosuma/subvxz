<i>...confirmed in Silicon Valley,</i>

01:23.542 --> 01:25.919
<i>and describes that the software,
Clear Slate,</i>

01:25.919 --> 01:29.506
<i>was designed to give users more control
of their public profile online.</i>

01:29.506 --> 01:33.010
<i>CEO Avett Thompson had touted sales
of Clear Slate</i>

01:33.010 --> 01:35.012
<i>in advance of The Shop's IPO,</i>

01:35.012 --> 01:37.222
<i>but federal investigators
recently determined</i>

01:37.222 --> 01:40.184
<i>that the software was, in fact,
not operational.</i>

01:40.184 --> 01:42.477
<i>Share prices plummeted
in the early trading...</i>

01:42.477 --> 01:43.645
Owen.

01:45.564 --> 01:46.565
O.

01:47.941 --> 01:50.694
<i>...shareholders
stand to lose over half a billion dollars.</i>

01:50.694 --> 01:52.529
<i>You've been going pretty hard.</i>

01:54.031 --> 01:56.950
Too hard. I need a vacation.

01:58.702 --> 02:00.829
You should come with me to Austin.

02:07.085 --> 02:08.794
Why don't we go to Taos instead?

02:08.794 --> 02:11.340
I haven't been
to New Mexico in forever.

02:11.340 --> 02:13.091
Well, me neither.

02:14.676 --> 02:16.053
Not since college.

02:23.685 --> 02:24.686
What?

02:27.481 --> 02:30.400
Just brings back a weird time.

02:31.610 --> 02:32.611
College?

02:33.153 --> 02:35.239
College, after college.

02:37.783 --> 02:39.409
<i>That's not vague.</i>

02:49.169 --> 02:50.379
There was...

02:54.174 --> 02:57.678
a fair amount
of recreational drugs involved.

03:00.013 --> 03:02.099
Well, I definitely wanna hear
those stories.

03:02.099 --> 03:04.393
No, they're really not that interesting.

03:05.477 --> 03:07.771
Okay, but just for the record...

03:09.690 --> 03:13.819
there's not a whole lot you could tell me
about who you used to be

03:14.570 --> 03:15.946
that would change anything.

03:16.530 --> 03:17.656
Not between us.

03:20.325 --> 03:21.493
Well, thank God for that.

03:24.538 --> 03:27.332
<i>The Shop's CEO,
Avett Thompson, has posted bail.</i>

03:27.332 --> 03:31.587
<i>Thompson and his wife, supermodel
and wellness guru Belle Watts-Thompson,</i>

03:31.587 --> 03:33.589
<i>return to their Pacific Heights mansion,</i>

03:33.589 --> 03:35.924
<i>where Thompson will remain
under house arrest.</i>

03:35.924 --> 03:39.636
<i>Several other senior employees at The Shop
are also under investigation,</i>

03:39.636 --> 03:40.804
<i>and more indictment--</i>

03:57.029 --> 03:58.739
<i>Hey, it's Carl. Leave a message.</i>

03:58.739 --> 03:59.907
Hey, it's me again.

04:02.284 --> 04:03.869
I still haven't heard from Owen.

04:03.869 --> 04:06.496
A US Marshal just showed up at my door.

04:06.496 --> 04:10.417
I think I really need to talk to a lawyer.

04:10.417 --> 04:12.252
Can you please call me back?

04:46.078 --> 04:47.538
We should probably get going.

04:50.290 --> 04:52.125
- Bailey.
- Was there someone here?

04:53.085 --> 04:55.504
I thought I heard you talking
to someone outside.

04:57.422 --> 04:59.258
I was just taking out the recycling,

04:59.258 --> 05:01.385
and I ran into Mrs. Hahn.

05:10.727 --> 05:12.729
Is there something you wanna talk about?

05:13.230 --> 05:14.398
Nope.

05:40.007 --> 05:43.010
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing.

06:01.403 --> 06:02.696
Sorry!

06:02.696 --> 06:06.241
- What are you doing?
- Sorry. Sorry.

06:21.423 --> 06:23.675
I'll be right here after last period.

06:41.235 --> 06:42.236
Oh, my God.

06:53.622 --> 06:55.624
- Ask her.
- That's her.

07:02.756 --> 07:04.174
- <i>Hey, J.</i>
- Hey there.

07:04.675 --> 07:05.676
How you holding up?

07:05.676 --> 07:08.387
Well, I woke up
to a US Marshal on my doorstep,

07:08.387 --> 07:10.138
and I nearly killed us
on the way to school

07:10.138 --> 07:12.099
'cause I thought someone was tailing me.

07:12.099 --> 07:15.018
Wait. You made Bailey go to school?

07:15.018 --> 07:16.186
<i>What was the alternative?</i>

07:16.687 --> 07:18.105
Not making her go to school.

07:18.105 --> 07:20.858
Better in school than home scanning
the Internet for the brewing shitstorm.

07:20.858 --> 07:21.942
<i>Is that Max?</i>

07:21.942 --> 07:23.026
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:23.026 --> 07:24.528
She sounds so positive. It's hard to tell.

07:24.528 --> 07:27.114
Well, I just spoke to my source
at the US Attorney's Office, Han.

07:27.114 --> 07:29.825
- Owen's a material witness.
- <i>What does that mean?</i>

07:29.825 --> 07:31.660
It means he's someone they wanna talk to.

07:31.660 --> 07:33.245
And if they don't get a hold of him soon,

07:33.245 --> 07:35.330
they'll likely make him
a subject of the investigation.

07:35.330 --> 07:37.165
Do you wanna translate that for me?

07:37.165 --> 07:38.667
He's in deep shit, Han.

07:39.918 --> 07:41.503
<i>Han, I took you off speaker.</i>

07:41.503 --> 07:44.047
- I can't believe this is happening.
- <i>I know.</i>

07:44.047 --> 07:45.716
I have his work computer with me.

07:45.716 --> 07:48.427
<i>I'm two steps away
from going through his mail.</i>

07:48.427 --> 07:49.720
How's it going with Bailey?

07:49.720 --> 07:51.889
Bad, Jules. It's going bad.

07:51.889 --> 07:54.308
Jesus.
How does he just take off like this?

07:54.308 --> 07:55.851
What the fuck is he thinking?

07:56.852 --> 07:59.062
- I'm sure you'll hear from him today.
- <i>Are you?</i>

07:59.062 --> 08:01.648
<i>Why don't you ask Max
how sure she is about that?</i>

08:03.400 --> 08:05.694
I'm pulling up to my studio.
I'll call you later.

08:37.643 --> 08:38.769
Okay.

08:47.986 --> 08:48.987
His will.

09:03.001 --> 09:04.753
Fuck. I just did.

09:04.753 --> 09:07.256
February 18, 2007.

09:08.465 --> 09:09.675
"L. Paul"?

09:11.093 --> 09:12.594
Anything interesting on there?

09:13.846 --> 09:16.598
Agent Naomi Wu. This is Agent O'Mackey.

09:16.598 --> 09:18.517
- It isn't a good time.
- I'm sure.

09:19.226 --> 09:20.853
Do you have any idea
where your husband is?

09:21.979 --> 09:24.189
No, actually. Do you?

09:24.189 --> 09:25.649
Is that his computer, Ms. Hall?

09:25.649 --> 09:29.319
Because if it is, any work product
would come under our purview.

09:29.319 --> 09:30.696
Don't you need a warrant?

09:35.742 --> 09:36.827
Thank you.

09:38.370 --> 09:39.997
Feel free to show yourselves out.

09:39.997 --> 09:41.874
It'd be helpful if you'd talk to us.

09:41.874 --> 09:43.542
Somebody's gotta think about Bailey.

09:44.543 --> 09:45.544
Excuse me?

09:45.544 --> 09:46.879
Agent O'Mackey's pointing out

09:46.879 --> 09:49.131
that if your husband doesn't return
in the next 24 hours,

09:49.131 --> 09:50.632
the state may wanna get involved.

09:53.844 --> 09:56.471
Look, I just went through all this
with the US Marshal.

09:56.471 --> 09:57.723
Why don't you talk to him?

09:57.723 --> 09:59.183
You spoke to a US Marshal?

09:59.183 --> 10:01.351
He was on my doorstep this morning. Yes.

10:01.351 --> 10:04.104
He came to your house? What was his name?

10:05.063 --> 10:07.441
Grady. Grady Bradford.

10:08.400 --> 10:11.278
In the future, Ms. Hall, you may wanna
be careful who you talk to about this.

10:13.155 --> 10:14.156
Great advice.

10:15.490 --> 10:16.992
If you want to speak to me any further,

10:16.992 --> 10:18.952
please contact my lawyer,
Carl Strumwasser.

10:18.952 --> 10:20.621
His office is in Marin.

10:22.664 --> 10:26.793
And if you want my help in any way,
leave Bailey out of this.

10:32.841 --> 10:34.843
Hey, Carl.
I don't know why you're not calling.

10:34.843 --> 10:36.762
Now the FBI is threatening me.

10:36.762 --> 10:38.388
I'm just gonna come over.

11:27.062 --> 11:28.814
- Carl.
- Han, it's a bad time.

11:28.814 --> 11:31.984
- Wait, wait. Did you get my messages?
- I did. Sorry.

11:31.984 --> 11:33.527
I'll call you later, okay?

11:33.527 --> 11:35.863
Wait. I need your help.

11:35.863 --> 11:38.657
The FBI is harassing me.
They threatened Bailey.

11:39.157 --> 11:40.659
I need your advice. I need--

11:40.659 --> 11:41.743
Carl?

11:42.244 --> 11:44.997
God. I forgot about the party. I'm sorry.

11:44.997 --> 11:46.206
You sure did.

11:46.206 --> 11:49.626
Babe, why don't you take her for a second?
I wanna chat with Hannah for a minute.

11:49.626 --> 11:52.504
No-- Thanks, but, actually,
I need Carl. I need--

11:52.504 --> 11:54.590
You've got a lot of nerve showing up here.

11:57.467 --> 11:58.468
What?

11:58.468 --> 12:00.971
Owen told Carl
that the IPO was a sure thing.

12:00.971 --> 12:03.140
Guess he forgot to mention
it's a fucking Ponzi scheme.

12:04.600 --> 12:06.185
You invested in The Shop?

12:06.185 --> 12:08.520
Oh, yeah. Only most of our life savings.

12:08.520 --> 12:10.689
I mean, who does that to friends?

12:11.565 --> 12:13.775
- Owen wouldn't do that.
- Oh, for Christ's sake.

12:14.276 --> 12:17.404
Do you really expect me to believe that
he didn't tell you anything about this?

12:17.404 --> 12:20.908
Patty, I haven't spoken to Owen
in 24 hours.

12:20.908 --> 12:23.660
I have no idea
what happened at The Shop.

12:26.997 --> 12:31.168
You know, my mother says
that every marriage has a liar and a fool,

12:31.752 --> 12:34.046
and you'd best be one
so you don't wind up the other.

12:35.130 --> 12:39.593
If you're not the liar,
then I really am sorry.

12:41.136 --> 12:43.555
But you're still gonna have to find help
somewhere else.

12:46.225 --> 12:47.726
And when you do speak to Owen,

12:48.519 --> 12:50.354
you can tell him to go fuck himself.

13:38.986 --> 13:40.946
...The Shop. Her dad works at The Shop.

13:40.946 --> 13:42.573
Is that Bailey?

13:42.573 --> 13:44.074
I feel bad for her.

13:48.036 --> 13:49.037
Bails!

13:55.085 --> 13:56.879
Thought it might be a good day
for a picnic.

14:41.089 --> 14:42.799
You haven't talked much about Jake.

14:42.799 --> 14:45.761
- Jake, he's just Jake.
- Well, my point exactly.

14:45.761 --> 14:48.013
Look, he's a lawyer. Very successful.

14:48.013 --> 14:50.474
Master-of-the-universe type.
You'd hate him.

14:51.892 --> 14:55.020
Now, truthfully, you know,
I was gearing up to ask you

14:55.020 --> 14:56.813
about your "could have been" boys.

14:56.813 --> 14:57.731
Who?

14:57.731 --> 15:00.400
It's a Bailey expression
for old boyfriends.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.027
The guys that could have been.

15:02.945 --> 15:05.072
You wanna talk about my old boyfriends?

15:05.072 --> 15:06.156
Okay.

15:06.156 --> 15:09.660
I wanna send a whiskey
to your old boyfriends for screwing it up,

15:09.660 --> 15:11.870
letting me be the one
who gets to sit here with you now.

15:22.339 --> 15:27.010
If we're gonna go there,
maybe we should start with Bailey's mom.

15:29.596 --> 15:32.140
Well, I told you about Olivia.

15:33.058 --> 15:36.687
You told me she died when Bailey was young
but not much else.

15:49.950 --> 15:52.786
She was killed in a car accident.

15:54.538 --> 15:56.623
A hit-and-run when Bailey was four.

16:00.711 --> 16:02.838
Bailey doesn't remember much about her,

16:02.838 --> 16:06.008
about anything
that happened back then,

16:06.008 --> 16:10.220
which, for the most part,
I think is for the best.

16:10.220 --> 16:11.889
But I don't know. I don't know.

16:13.056 --> 16:14.141
Maybe it's not.

16:16.685 --> 16:17.936
I'm sorry.

16:22.524 --> 16:24.902
It's the worst thing
that's ever happened to me.

16:27.863 --> 16:29.489
But now I think...

16:32.242 --> 16:35.120
maybe it's not the only thing.

16:55.724 --> 16:57.184
- Hannah?
- <i>Hey, Jake.</i>

17:00.979 --> 17:02.022
What's wrong?

17:03.315 --> 17:05.025
What makes you think something's wrong?

17:05.025 --> 17:08.237
Well, for starters, I haven't heard
from you since you got engaged.

17:08.237 --> 17:11.198
So, either you need a lawyer,
or you're getting a divorce.

17:12.074 --> 17:13.407
I need a lawyer, Jake.

17:16.078 --> 17:17.162
What's going on?

17:18.288 --> 17:19.705
My husband's in trouble.

17:20.665 --> 17:22.792
<i>Your husband's in trouble,
and you're calling me?</i>

17:22.792 --> 17:25.378
- I'm not gonna savor this, but--
- <i>Jake.</i>

17:25.378 --> 17:26.713
<i>Define trouble.</i>

17:27.506 --> 17:30.759
- He's lead engineer for The Shop.
- <i>What?</i>

17:30.759 --> 17:32.427
Shit, Han.

17:32.427 --> 17:35.055
<i>And all of these people
keep showing up to grill me.</i>

17:35.055 --> 17:38.642
Like, couple of FBI agents
just left my studio.

17:38.642 --> 17:41.562
I woke up to a US Marshal outside my door.

17:41.562 --> 17:45.107
Well, the FBI makes sense,
and you're gonna hear from the SEC soon.

17:45.107 --> 17:48.735
But the US Marshal, that is a bit odd.

17:48.735 --> 17:50.153
<i>Agent Wu seemed to think so.</i>

17:51.280 --> 17:54.324
I mean, tech fraud isn't generally within
the purview of the Marshal's office.

17:54.324 --> 17:57.035
Not unless you're dealing with
some kind of a fugitive.

18:00.122 --> 18:01.123
Right.

18:02.958 --> 18:03.959
<i>Han?</i>

18:07.504 --> 18:09.590
I haven't heard from Owen in 24 hours.

18:14.636 --> 18:16.972
Can we just stay here
until I hear from him?

18:19.474 --> 18:20.809
I move when you move.

18:22.269 --> 18:23.812
Bobby.

18:23.812 --> 18:26.899
- Just heard about Duke. Congrats, man.
- Thanks, Coach.

18:26.899 --> 18:28.984
I'm stoked for you, buddy. You earned it.

18:28.984 --> 18:31.486
See you at practice.
If the rain doesn't get us.

18:33.238 --> 18:35.240
You got into Duke?

18:35.240 --> 18:37.659
Yeah.
They came through with a full ride.

18:38.702 --> 18:40.287
That's amazing.

18:40.287 --> 18:43.081
I mean, I know Stanford's
gonna match that, but...

18:45.250 --> 18:47.753
Wait. You didn't, like, accept?

18:48.795 --> 18:49.796
Bailey--

18:55.219 --> 18:58.472
You're going to college 3000 miles away
and you didn't even tell me.

18:58.472 --> 19:01.099
Stanford wasn't a sure thing,
and Duke put a clock on me.

19:01.099 --> 19:03.435
I was gonna tell you, but then
all this stuff happened with your dad.

19:04.144 --> 19:06.813
Bailey! I'm sorry! Bailey!

19:06.813 --> 19:08.357
I can't believe he ran.

19:08.357 --> 19:10.484
You know that
that does not look very good.

19:10.484 --> 19:12.694
<i>No, I know how it looks. I'm just--</i>

19:12.694 --> 19:15.822
<i>I'm having a hard time believing
Owen's involved in this, Jake.</i>

19:15.822 --> 19:19.409
'Cause the guys who run are generally
the ones who aren't involved in a crime.

19:19.409 --> 19:21.411
<i>Can you not, with the Harvard voice?</i>

19:21.411 --> 19:22.329
Facts are facts.

19:22.955 --> 19:25.165
I am telling you Owen is not that guy.

19:25.874 --> 19:28.418
<i>Listen, Han. I don't wanna sound
like a jerk here, but--</i>

19:28.418 --> 19:29.711
When's that ever stopped you before?

19:29.711 --> 19:32.631
- <i>You're starting to sound like most wives...</i>
- Excuse me?

19:32.631 --> 19:35.551
...whose husbands have been accused
of white-collar crime.

19:35.551 --> 19:36.969
I strike you as most wives?

19:36.969 --> 19:40.639
<i>No, but I've represented
a lot of guys like this</i>.

19:43.600 --> 19:46.353
People don't run for no reason, Hannah.

19:48.063 --> 19:54.403
Please, can you try
to think about this differently?

19:55.070 --> 19:57.865
- <i>Differently, how?</i>
- I don't know. I just...

20:00.701 --> 20:05.205
Even if I could get my head around
Owen running to avoid jail, or something,

20:05.205 --> 20:06.290
I--

20:07.499 --> 20:09.126
He loves his daughter.

20:09.918 --> 20:11.461
He would do anything for her. He--

20:11.461 --> 20:13.964
<i>Yeah, well,
he's got a nice way of showing it.</i>

20:13.964 --> 20:15.716
- So glad I called.
- <i>Wait.</i>

20:15.716 --> 20:16.800
Stop.

20:18.635 --> 20:19.636
I wanna help.

20:22.723 --> 20:24.433
I know this great private investigator.

20:24.433 --> 20:27.519
<i>You want me to have him do some digging?
See what he comes up with?</i>

20:31.356 --> 20:33.901
Yeah. Yeah, I guess.

21:03.931 --> 21:04.932
Hannah?

21:21.448 --> 21:22.449
Dad?

21:54.189 --> 21:55.440
Oh, shit!

22:01.446 --> 22:03.532
What are you doing here?
Why aren't you at school?

22:03.532 --> 22:05.492
- I took off early. It doesn't matter.
- It does.

22:05.492 --> 22:08.203
- It's not safe for you to be--
- Someone broke into the house.

22:08.996 --> 22:11.832
- Are you sure?
- Well, I didn't stick around to find out.

22:11.832 --> 22:15.752
But I definitely heard someone,
and the living room window was wide open.

22:18.672 --> 22:21.633
I'm not going back to school tomorrow.
It was a total nightmare.

22:23.594 --> 22:24.595
Who are you calling?

22:26.388 --> 22:28.015
Hello. I need to report a break-in.

22:38.275 --> 22:39.276
House is clear.

22:39.818 --> 22:42.321
Are you sure you didn't
just leave the window open, ma'am?

22:42.321 --> 22:44.531
- Pretty sure.
- Well, I don't see any sign of a break-in.

22:44.531 --> 22:47.159
I was there. I heard someone.
So, there's a sign.

22:47.910 --> 22:50.204
We're a little on edge, Lieutenant.

22:51.663 --> 22:53.749
I can understand,
what with everything going on.

23:00.839 --> 23:03.133
- Thank you for your help, sir.
- Yes, ma'am.

23:03.133 --> 23:04.301
Let's go.

23:05.385 --> 23:08.597
It's okay. We're fine.

23:47.678 --> 23:49.054
Nothing's missing.

23:50.055 --> 23:53.308
- Then what were they doing here?
- Well, I have no idea.

24:16.290 --> 24:18.500
Do you want
a grilled cheese or something?

24:20.085 --> 24:21.086
Whatever.

24:32.639 --> 24:33.640
Stay here.

24:38.979 --> 24:40.063
Who is it?

24:40.063 --> 24:42.065
Pepperoni, extra cheese.

24:46.737 --> 24:47.738
Hey.

24:48.572 --> 24:49.573
Hi.

24:49.573 --> 24:51.450
- Come here.
- Thank you for coming.

24:51.450 --> 24:53.285
Of course. Of course.

24:55.204 --> 24:56.747
- Hey, little one.
- Hey.

24:58.373 --> 24:59.458
Hi.

25:02.836 --> 25:04.213
Should we split a pizza

25:04.213 --> 25:06.715
or just get right into
the coconut and salty caramel?

25:06.715 --> 25:08.008
I'll get the spoons.

25:08.008 --> 25:09.676
Yeah. Meet me outside, okay?

25:15.140 --> 25:18.519
Han, what's this I hear
about a visit from the US Marshal?

25:20.562 --> 25:21.730
It's pretty unusual.

25:21.730 --> 25:24.900
Financial crime isn't typically
the jurisdiction of the Marshal's office.

25:24.900 --> 25:26.568
Can we talk about something else?

25:27.236 --> 25:28.987
I'm just trying to help, Han.

25:28.987 --> 25:31.365
It sounds more like
you're trying to run out a story.

25:32.908 --> 25:34.743
If I were trying to run out a story,
I--

25:35.619 --> 25:38.997
I would've ambushed Owen
yesterday morning, like my editor wanted.

25:41.291 --> 25:42.292
Sorry.

25:43.168 --> 25:45.963
I just-- I can't believe
I haven't heard from him.

25:46.463 --> 25:49.758
This is the longest I've gone
without talking to Owen since we met.

25:56.932 --> 25:59.142
I don't know
if Jules told you about my mother.

25:59.852 --> 26:01.687
- Not a lot.
- Yeah.

26:04.106 --> 26:08.193
Let's just say I've organized my life
to not miss things.

26:10.028 --> 26:11.446
So I thought.

26:14.658 --> 26:19.454
You know how many stories have sat
right under my nose for months and months?

26:19.454 --> 26:20.539
It's not the same.

26:22.875 --> 26:25.711
Well, there are always shadows
that we don't see.

26:25.711 --> 26:31.508
So, you think I sound like a fool if I say
there has to be something else going on?

26:31.508 --> 26:33.677
There's some explanation for this.

26:34.803 --> 26:39.516
I think we should start with today
and work our way back.

26:42.978 --> 26:45.647
Wow, I just got a huge swirl of caramel.

26:45.647 --> 26:46.982
Penicillin for the soul.

26:46.982 --> 26:49.151
Isn't that chicken soup?

26:49.151 --> 26:50.903
No, it's definitely ice cream.

26:56.408 --> 26:57.409
You okay?

27:00.495 --> 27:01.622
Bobby's going to Duke.

27:03.916 --> 27:05.250
What happened to Stanford?

27:06.710 --> 27:09.963
I don't know.
Duke gave him a full scholarship, so--

27:11.381 --> 27:15.302
Okay. Well, I mean,
the flights aren't terrible.

27:16.136 --> 27:17.638
Like my dad will allow that.

27:17.638 --> 27:19.139
He might.

27:19.139 --> 27:22.684
I told him I wanted to go away
with Bobby and his parents last week.

27:22.684 --> 27:24.353
He lost his mind.

27:24.353 --> 27:26.647
That's just standard dad stuff.

27:26.647 --> 27:29.066
But he got all weird about it. It w--

27:30.484 --> 27:31.485
It was like...

27:32.402 --> 27:33.862
he was scared.

27:36.156 --> 27:38.867
Scared of me being so far away.

27:41.245 --> 27:42.579
That sounds like your dad.

27:44.039 --> 27:45.040
Right.

27:49.711 --> 27:52.005
So how does any of this make sense?

27:53.882 --> 27:55.926
Which part of today
do you wanna start with?

27:55.926 --> 27:58.679
The US Marshal. What's his angle?

27:58.679 --> 28:00.764
Well, if Owen is a fugitive...

28:00.764 --> 28:04.768
Sure, but then it would've been the FBI
who asked the Marshal's office to step in

28:04.768 --> 28:06.186
to help track Owen down.

28:06.854 --> 28:10.440
Yeah, the FBI had no idea
what Grady Bradford was doing here.

28:10.440 --> 28:12.401
They seemed legitimately surprised.

28:12.401 --> 28:15.487
Did this guy, Grady--
Did he show you credentials or anything?

28:15.487 --> 28:16.780
He showed me his badge.

28:16.780 --> 28:18.198
Anybody can make a fake badge.

28:18.198 --> 28:20.200
He didn't show you anything
with his photo on it?

28:22.244 --> 28:23.245
No.

28:24.121 --> 28:25.539
- And...
- What?

28:25.539 --> 28:29.209
...his number, he didn't give it to me
on any kind of official card.

28:29.209 --> 28:31.211
He wrote it out on a napkin.

28:32.004 --> 28:34.089
That's weird. Do you have the napkin?

28:44.224 --> 28:46.143
Did The Shop do a lot of business
in Austin?

28:46.768 --> 28:48.061
Not that I'm aware of. Why?

28:48.896 --> 28:52.357
Pretty sure 5-1-2 is an Austin area code.

28:53.233 --> 28:54.610
Does that mean anything to you?

28:54.610 --> 28:56.195
You should come with me to Austin.

28:56.820 --> 28:57.863
Austin?

28:58.363 --> 29:01.533
They have
that woodturners convention coming up.

29:03.076 --> 29:04.161
Do you have to go?

29:05.120 --> 29:06.121
What is it?

29:08.123 --> 29:10.417
Might not mean anything, but--

29:15.631 --> 29:17.633
Can you keep an eye on Bailey
for a couple of minutes?

29:17.633 --> 29:18.926
Sure.

29:19.760 --> 29:21.261
Don't open the door for anyone.

29:29.770 --> 29:30.771
Hey.

29:31.396 --> 29:32.564
Look, I don't have long.

29:33.065 --> 29:35.442
Patty's putting Susie down.
I told her I was going for a run.

29:37.861 --> 29:39.988
I feel bad about what happened earlier.

29:40.739 --> 29:44.826
I-- You need to know, I didn't--

29:46.036 --> 29:47.204
We didn't...

29:47.204 --> 29:48.830
You didn't invest in The Shop.

29:51.124 --> 29:52.793
What happened to the money, Carl?

29:55.337 --> 29:58.215
Guessing Owen didn't tell you
about my buddy Linus down in Costa Rica?

29:58.215 --> 30:01.969
I know all about your buddy Linus
in Costa Rica and his sportsbook.

30:02.845 --> 30:05.722
- I thought you stopped with that.
- Yeah. I had. And then...

30:06.515 --> 30:07.599
I fell off the wagon.

30:08.725 --> 30:11.937
You know, and Patty,
she's been under a lot of stress lately.

30:12.563 --> 30:14.815
So you told her
you put the money into The Shop.

30:15.315 --> 30:18.235
She knew that I'd dug into our savings.
I had to tell her something.

30:18.235 --> 30:21.446
I had no idea The Shop was in trouble.
Owen didn't say a thing.

30:21.446 --> 30:24.700
You can't let her think
that you lost the money because of Owen.

30:24.700 --> 30:27.953
If she came that hard at me, who knows
what she's saying to other people?

30:30.539 --> 30:32.332
Yeah, I know. I'll tell her.

30:41.133 --> 30:43.010
Look, I don't know if this helps.

30:43.510 --> 30:45.179
I don't get it either.

30:47.139 --> 30:48.765
This is not the guy I know.

30:54.146 --> 30:55.147
Did Owen--

30:56.356 --> 30:59.443
Did he ever say anything to you
about spending time in Austin?

31:00.235 --> 31:02.279
Texas? No, why?

31:03.238 --> 31:06.450
The US Marshal who was at the house,
I think he's based there.

31:06.450 --> 31:07.534
I mean--

31:10.913 --> 31:13.207
Yeah, but there was actually this time

31:13.207 --> 31:17.503
that we were down in the Fillmore
or something, and we both realized

31:17.503 --> 31:20.380
that we might have been at the same
John Lee Hooker concert at Antone's.

31:20.380 --> 31:21.507
I'm not following.

31:21.507 --> 31:23.759
Okay, it's a club in Austin.

31:24.927 --> 31:27.179
- So he's been there?
- No, that's the thing.

31:27.179 --> 31:31.725
On the way home,
Owen said he was real confused.

31:31.725 --> 31:33.018
He was adamant about it,

31:33.018 --> 31:36.688
like that he'd never been to Antone's
and he'd never been to Austin.

31:40.817 --> 31:43.570
The only reason I'm remembering it is
'cause it's weird, right?

31:43.570 --> 31:45.614
Like, who cares?

31:50.494 --> 31:51.787
Shit. All right. I gotta go.

31:51.787 --> 31:53.288
Yeah. Okay.

31:53.288 --> 31:56.041
- I'll take care of it, okay? With Patty.
- Thank you.

32:25.737 --> 32:27.364
<i>Marshals Service. How can I help you?</i>

32:27.364 --> 32:29.491
Is there an Agent Bradford working there?

32:29.491 --> 32:31.743
<i>I can put you through to his office.
Please hold.</i>

33:39.728 --> 33:40.896
Bailey...

33:43.690 --> 33:45.943
- Can I sit?
- Sure.

33:58.580 --> 34:01.917
I've been thinking about the note
your dad left you.

34:04.169 --> 34:07.506
What he meant when he said,
"You know what matters about me".

34:07.506 --> 34:10.300
Yeah. I know. My father loves me.
You made your point.

34:11.009 --> 34:12.636
No, I think maybe I was wrong.

34:14.096 --> 34:15.556
Maybe he meant something else.

34:16.306 --> 34:17.306
Like what?

34:18.183 --> 34:22.437
Bailey, did your dad and you spend
any time in Austin?

34:22.437 --> 34:23.522
As in Texas?

34:24.438 --> 34:26.024
That's so random. Why?

34:31.989 --> 34:34.074
There was someone here this morning.

34:34.699 --> 34:35.868
A US Marshal.

34:36.784 --> 34:38.120
Was he here to arrest Dad?

34:38.661 --> 34:40.873
No. That's just it. I don't think so.

34:41.456 --> 34:43.458
I don't know what he was doing here.

34:43.458 --> 34:45.418
And he works out of Austin.

34:46.545 --> 34:49.005
What would that have to do with my dad?

34:49.005 --> 34:50.716
That's what I'm trying to figure out.

34:55.137 --> 34:56.138
I think--

34:56.138 --> 35:01.018
I think we went to a football game
in Texas once.

35:01.018 --> 35:02.352
It might've been Austin.

35:02.352 --> 35:05.898
I can't remember your father
ever even watching a football game.

35:07.191 --> 35:09.026
Yeah, I know, it's weird, right?

35:09.026 --> 35:14.489
But I have this distinct memory
of being at a game with him

35:14.489 --> 35:19.661
and the whole stadium was,
like, this dark orange.

35:23.624 --> 35:26.752
I think maybe we were visiting relatives
or something.

35:26.752 --> 35:29.838
- In Austin? You have relatives in Austin?
- No.

35:31.423 --> 35:32.549
I don't know.

35:33.342 --> 35:35.511
Maybe it was just friends.

35:35.511 --> 35:38.472
- It was like a million years ago, so--
- But you're sure it was Texas?

35:38.472 --> 35:42.226
No. No, I'm not sure, Hannah.
About as not sure as you can get.

35:47.940 --> 35:51.443
- Did something happen with Bobby?
- Can I just be alone, please?

35:52.444 --> 35:54.363
- Bailey--
- Just leave me alone.

36:04.122 --> 36:06.583
<i>Hey. I'm still waiting
to hear back from my guy.</i>

36:06.583 --> 36:08.252
Yeah, I just have a quick question.

36:08.252 --> 36:10.546
- <i>You follow college football, right?</i>
- Yep.

36:10.546 --> 36:13.382
<i>What can you tell me
about the Austin football stadium?</i>

36:13.382 --> 36:14.883
I can tell you it's not called that.

36:15.467 --> 36:16.718
Do you know what the colors are?

36:16.718 --> 36:20.305
<i>As in the team colors?
It's white and burnt orange.</i>

36:20.305 --> 36:21.849
You sure about the orange?

36:21.849 --> 36:24.184
<i>Well, I'm not a Hook 'em Horns guy
if that's what you're asking,</i>

36:24.184 --> 36:25.269
<i>but yeah.</i>

36:25.269 --> 36:28.230
The stadium, the end zones, the uniforms.

36:28.230 --> 36:29.314
<i>Why? What's going on?</i>

36:29.314 --> 36:32.568
It's just,
Owen had a weird thing about Austin.

36:32.568 --> 36:35.863
And Bailey thinks she remembers
being at a game with him there.

36:35.863 --> 36:37.948
Look, Hannah, I'm sure
there's gonna be all kinds of things

36:37.948 --> 36:39.366
that seem weird in retrospect.

36:39.366 --> 36:42.494
But, believe me, this is what people do.

36:43.078 --> 36:44.454
<i>It's probably just--</i>

36:44.454 --> 36:46.164
Grady Bradford's from Austin.

36:46.164 --> 36:48.834
- <i>Who?</i>
- The US Marshal that was here.

36:49.918 --> 36:51.086
<i>I called his office.</i>

36:51.628 --> 36:54.256
<i>It's the Marshal Service
for the Western District of Texas.</i>

36:54.256 --> 36:55.591
<i>It's in Austin.</i>

36:56.717 --> 36:57.718
Okay.

36:58.552 --> 37:00.679
The FBI didn't know about Grady.

37:01.763 --> 37:03.182
<i>What if they're not connected?</i>

37:03.682 --> 37:06.059
You said that people don't run
for no reason.

37:07.436 --> 37:09.354
What if Owen's running
from something else?

37:09.354 --> 37:12.357
Yeah, right.
Look, that's what the investigator is for.

37:12.357 --> 37:13.775
He's gonna look into all this.

37:13.775 --> 37:15.235
<i>Gonna get us some answers.</i>

37:15.235 --> 37:16.695
Yeah, when he calls you back.

37:16.695 --> 37:19.364
- <i>He's gonna call me back. Soon.</i>
- Okay.

37:19.364 --> 37:20.449
<i>Listen to me, Hannah.</i>

37:20.449 --> 37:22.242
You need to sit tight.

37:22.993 --> 37:25.370
<i>Whatever this is,
you want no part of it, all right?</i>

37:25.871 --> 37:27.289
- Yeah.
- <i>Hannah?</i>

37:27.289 --> 37:29.708
Thanks, Jake. Got it.
Let me know when you know.

37:33.504 --> 37:35.130
Can you not? I just had a sip.

37:35.631 --> 37:38.550
I don't care about the wine,
and you're right.

37:38.550 --> 37:40.385
You're not going to school tomorrow.

37:40.385 --> 37:41.803
- I'm not?
- No.

37:41.803 --> 37:43.555
I have a new plan.

38:06.161 --> 38:09.164
<i>I'm sorry for the delay, folks,
but they got us moving again.</i>

38:09.706 --> 38:13.085
<i>I heard it's clear skies
once we get to our cruising altitude.</i>

38:28.141 --> 38:30.018
<i>Could the flight attendants
take your seats?</i>

38:30.018 --> 38:31.395
<i>We are cleared for takeoff.</i>

38:32.271 --> 38:34.273
<i>We'll have you in Austin
in no time at all.</i>
