00:42.018 --> 00:43.061
<b>Mom?</b>

00:44.229 --> 00:45.480
Everything OK?

00:46.314 --> 00:47.566
Yeah. Do you...

00:48.316 --> 00:49.734
Do you hear that?

00:52.279 --> 00:54.030
Sorry. Is the TV too loud?

00:58.200 --> 01:00.160
Why don't you go back to bed?

01:04.290 --> 01:06.417
I just need a glass of water.

01:15.258 --> 01:16.551
Hello?

01:19.262 --> 01:20.388
Who is this?

01:20.513 --> 01:23.224
Hi, Weasel. Season's greetings
from Christmasland.

01:23.349 --> 01:26.019
Hi, Maggot, hi.
I'm coming to get you.

01:26.478 --> 01:29.106
I don't want to leave.
I have a lot of friends here.

01:29.230 --> 01:31.774
We're wondering
if you've seen Father Christmas.

01:32.734 --> 01:35.194
Haley, that man who took you
is not Father Christmas.

01:35.278 --> 01:37.655
He is a very bad man.
You stay away from him, OK?

01:38.573 --> 01:40.491
A ride in the Wraith
is the best thing

01:40.617 --> 01:42.535
that ever happened to little Haley.

01:42.660 --> 01:45.162
If you were truly her friend
you would be happy for her.

01:45.288 --> 01:46.580
Who is this?

01:46.706 --> 01:47.831
Where is Father?

01:47.956 --> 01:49.500
I don't know
what he's done to you,

01:49.626 --> 01:51.376
but that man is not Father Christmas.

01:51.501 --> 01:54.755
He was looking for you and your
bridge and he hasn't come back.

01:54.881 --> 01:56.215
Where is he?

01:56.340 --> 02:00.052
- I don't know, but I know he's hurt.
- Liar! No one can hurt him.

02:00.176 --> 02:03.180
- I can.
- You cannot. And you will not.

02:03.305 --> 02:05.307
But he will find you, Vic McQueen.

02:05.431 --> 02:07.768
He will find you and bring you to us.

02:07.893 --> 02:10.395
And then we can play
Scissors for the Drifter.

02:10.519 --> 02:13.230
It will be so fun.

02:15.775 --> 02:17.193
Hello?

02:20.404 --> 02:22.239
Vicky, what are you doing?

02:22.740 --> 02:25.284
Honey, please take your pills.
Go back to bed.

04:23.523 --> 04:26.442
Howdy. Need some help?

04:27.610 --> 04:28.986
Howdy.

04:49.422 --> 04:51.132
Vicky, I made eggs.

04:54.719 --> 04:56.971
Mom, this looks amazing
but I'm kind of in a rush.

04:57.098 --> 04:59.099
No, sit.
School doesn't start for an hour.

04:59.224 --> 05:01.935
- I've got to get my bike from Dad.
- I sold it.

05:02.769 --> 05:03.812
What?

05:04.270 --> 05:05.980
I sold that dirtbike.

05:08.608 --> 05:10.359
What, while I was in the hospital?

05:11.027 --> 05:12.070
How are you feeling?

05:12.153 --> 05:14.321
You must have been sleepwalking
or dreaming...

05:14.446 --> 05:15.322
It wasn't yours.

05:16.366 --> 05:17.826
You were driving illegally.

05:17.908 --> 05:19.827
- It wasn't good for you.
- Dad gave it to me.

05:19.952 --> 05:23.288
- Years ago, without asking me.
- OK, who did you sell it to?

05:24.290 --> 05:26.792
Someone on the Internet.
"Craig's Place" or whatever.

05:27.417 --> 05:28.585
Alright. Get it back.

05:29.336 --> 05:30.753
It's gone, Vicky.

05:30.878 --> 05:33.631
- You had no right!
- I'm the mother.

05:34.841 --> 05:36.468
Yeah, you're something alright.

05:40.096 --> 05:41.722
Ask your tiles where to find my bike.

05:42.682 --> 05:43.975
Hello to you too, sunshine.

05:44.100 --> 05:45.393
My mom sold it. Please.

05:45.518 --> 05:47.145
I can't help you.

05:47.270 --> 05:49.730
Ask the tiles where it is
or where I can find a new knife.

05:49.814 --> 05:51.400
Jolene said knives can be replaced.

05:51.482 --> 05:53.568
I threw my tiles away.

06:00.241 --> 06:01.992
Haley called me from Christmasland.

06:03.911 --> 06:05.163
Was Daniel there?

06:06.581 --> 06:07.874
I don't know.

06:09.250 --> 06:11.042
Haley sounded weird. Different.

06:11.168 --> 06:14.505
And there was a girl with her,
another one of his victims. They...

06:14.963 --> 06:17.507
I know you're scared, Maggie,
but we don't have a choice.

06:17.632 --> 06:20.468
- I'm not scared, Vic. I'm done.
- Maggie...

06:26.348 --> 06:29.519
All my life, no matter what happened
I knew I could take care of myself.

06:30.603 --> 06:32.606
I was smart, I was strong...

06:32.731 --> 06:34.941
I felt safe
because I could protect myself.

06:35.066 --> 06:36.443
That feeling is gone.

06:36.568 --> 06:39.945
OK, but no one can keep these kids
safe from Charlie Manx but me.

06:40.529 --> 06:41.989
I need my knife.

06:48.871 --> 06:50.289
Then I hope you find it.

07:01.633 --> 07:02.967
Your friend Haley is there,

07:03.092 --> 07:05.428
safe and sound
with all my other children.

07:06.721 --> 07:09.641
Strong creatives can pull
their Inscapes into the real world

07:09.724 --> 07:10.934
with the help of a knife.

07:12.352 --> 07:16.397
That chair found me
and got me moving again.

07:19.483 --> 07:22.444
The girl who finds lost things
can find lost children.

07:22.528 --> 07:23.362
Shut up...

07:23.947 --> 07:25.864
Kill him...

07:26.531 --> 07:27.658
Damn it.

07:29.577 --> 07:30.870
Oh, God...

07:37.584 --> 07:38.751
Hey, Brat.

07:38.877 --> 07:40.629
Mom sold my bike.

07:41.504 --> 07:43.257
Yeah, I'm sorry.

07:44.466 --> 07:47.344
I tried to talk her out of it.

07:47.469 --> 07:50.222
But... hard to argue
with you in the hospital, you know?

07:52.223 --> 07:53.934
I thought you would have visited me.

07:56.185 --> 07:57.561
I had to work.

07:58.354 --> 08:00.106
But I'll make it up to you.

08:04.735 --> 08:06.529
I want to go to Bike Week.

08:06.654 --> 08:08.697
Wait, no.
I thought we were going to go.

08:08.823 --> 08:10.700
Please, Dad. We always go.

08:11.199 --> 08:12.701
Yeah. OK.

08:14.287 --> 08:16.038
You, me and Tiff will go together.

08:18.039 --> 08:19.625
OK. Bye.

08:22.294 --> 08:24.254
Sorry about your water pump.

08:24.379 --> 08:26.923
You let us know if there's
anything else we can do to help.

08:27.924 --> 08:28.925
You're old.

08:29.049 --> 08:32.679
Hey, we talked about this, sport.
What's the Scout Law?

08:33.178 --> 08:34.429
A Scout is kind?

08:34.554 --> 08:37.140
And courteous. Apologize to Mr. Manx.

08:37.265 --> 08:40.602
No need to apologize
for the truth, Bradley.

08:41.061 --> 08:44.773
In fact, I think truthful boys
should be rewarded.

08:47.151 --> 08:48.527
Sorry, sport.

08:48.652 --> 08:51.655
Too much sugar already today.
You don't want to ruin your teeth.

09:03.834 --> 09:05.209
Morning, sir.

09:05.752 --> 09:08.589
Fine weather, ain't it?
What can I do you for?

09:08.714 --> 09:10.798
Ten bottles of engine coolant.

09:10.923 --> 09:14.344
And would you be so kind
as to lend me your telephone machine?

09:15.261 --> 09:17.513
Landline? Of course.

09:20.475 --> 09:23.393
You know, you look like
a fella comes in here sometimes.

09:24.270 --> 09:27.065
Folks around here
call him Father Christmas.

09:28.232 --> 09:30.108
Are you his grandpa?

09:30.610 --> 09:31.944
Yes.

09:32.569 --> 09:34.739
Well, tell him hello from Sam.

09:51.380 --> 09:54.382
I need you to fly to Colorado.

09:55.342 --> 09:57.426
Co-lo-ra-do.

09:58.803 --> 10:01.305
Today. Now. Write down this address.

10:03.557 --> 10:05.559
Well, get a pen, Bing.

10:14.610 --> 10:17.654
I saved this for you, Bradley.

10:20.407 --> 10:22.826
Your cruel father isn't watching.

10:23.494 --> 10:24.912
My father is kind.

10:25.037 --> 10:26.080
Really?

10:27.288 --> 10:30.459
Is it kind to deny candy to a child?

10:33.795 --> 10:36.131
No need to worry
about your teeth, Bradley.

10:36.256 --> 10:39.675
I know of a place
where you can get a shiny new set.

11:02.239 --> 11:04.199
You look like you've seen a ghost.

11:06.034 --> 11:08.912
Did you know your boss
ran my friend over with his car?

11:10.998 --> 11:13.583
Her name is Maggie Leigh.
She's a librarian, Bing.

11:14.168 --> 11:17.003
- She must have been causing trouble.
- No.

11:17.128 --> 11:19.173
Manx is causing trouble. Where is he?

11:20.591 --> 11:21.549
I don't know.

11:24.927 --> 11:27.638
This is Peter Ives.
He worked for Manx right before you.

11:29.015 --> 11:30.808
- You should get out.
- He's dead, Bing.

11:31.308 --> 11:34.019
Police blamed a bunch of kidnappings
on him, found him dead,

11:34.103 --> 11:36.438
same as everyone else
who has ever worked for Manx.

11:43.613 --> 11:46.407
Charlie Manx has a house
in the real world. I saw it.

11:47.157 --> 11:48.783
Tell me where it is, Bing.

11:52.162 --> 11:54.789
Tell the police, OK?
Before he kills you too, as well...

11:58.126 --> 12:02.088
Tell your lies. Mess with my head.

12:02.546 --> 12:04.965
But know that you could end up dead.

12:21.524 --> 12:24.109
There she is. I'll see you later.

12:25.402 --> 12:28.697
Hey. How did it go?
A little progress?

12:29.240 --> 12:32.910
Yeah, from dull throb
to searing, unbearable burn.

12:33.409 --> 12:35.828
- Taking anything for it?
- No.

12:36.371 --> 12:38.456
Well, your stutter stopped.

12:38.581 --> 12:40.709
I threw my Scrabble tiles away.

12:41.334 --> 12:42.544
Really?

12:43.962 --> 12:45.672
You loved that Scrabble bag.

12:45.797 --> 12:48.132
I thought you'd be happy.

12:49.634 --> 12:52.011
I think you should stay with me
until you get better.

12:52.594 --> 12:53.555
No.

12:54.347 --> 12:56.598
- My fish would get lonely.
- Bring your damn fish.

12:56.723 --> 12:58.100
Joe, I'm fine.

12:58.225 --> 12:59.894
I just know your history,

13:00.019 --> 13:02.689
and I don't want you to fall
back into any bad habits.

13:04.065 --> 13:05.983
I finished the pills they gave me.

13:06.108 --> 13:09.111
I tried to get some more
but they wouldn't refill the scrip.

13:09.653 --> 13:11.738
- You can check my bag.
- OK.

13:13.322 --> 13:17.911
OK, so no more
Scrabble tile goose chases?

13:18.036 --> 13:18.870
Nope.

13:18.996 --> 13:22.207
And no more tracking down
cold-blooded killers on your own?

13:22.331 --> 13:23.749
Not a chance.

13:24.376 --> 13:25.669
Good, because...

13:26.168 --> 13:28.630
I had a foot in the grave
worrying about you.

13:29.171 --> 13:31.841
You had a foot in the grave
because you're old as sin!

13:33.384 --> 13:34.552
Come on.

13:54.488 --> 13:56.489
By the time we arrive
at the scrapyard

13:56.615 --> 14:00.368
I may be too weak
to communicate with the proprietress.

14:00.493 --> 14:03.079
It is imperative
that she sell you a new water pump

14:03.204 --> 14:05.540
and that you install it immediately.

14:06.916 --> 14:09.169
My life will depend on it.

14:14.089 --> 14:15.507
Please acknowledge me.

14:20.055 --> 14:23.223
Nod your head to show you understand.

14:27.019 --> 14:29.188
Nobody likes a sulk, Bing.

14:29.688 --> 14:31.231
What's on your mind?

14:37.236 --> 14:39.031
What happened to Peter Ives?

14:40.866 --> 14:42.368
Did you kill him?

14:46.788 --> 14:48.289
Are you going to kill me?

14:48.956 --> 14:50.500
Is that what you think?

14:50.625 --> 14:52.210
I just want to go to Christmasland.

14:52.335 --> 14:56.172
That is exactly where you will go
once our work is complete.

14:56.839 --> 15:00.509
I took Peter Ives and the others
to Christmasland.

15:00.634 --> 15:02.387
Right up to the gate.

15:03.888 --> 15:06.474
Sadly they were unable to enter

15:07.015 --> 15:11.186
because they proved
to be naughty, not nice.

15:12.604 --> 15:14.482
Naughty boys can't go
to Christmasland.

15:14.607 --> 15:18.860
As long as you remain on my nice list
you have nothing to fear.

15:19.528 --> 15:22.114
Now please, time is of the essence.

15:22.614 --> 15:24.408
But I wonder,

15:25.074 --> 15:27.494
where are all these questions
coming from?

15:30.914 --> 15:32.998
I saw Vic at school today.

15:35.127 --> 15:38.337
Vic McQueen? Of course.

15:39.296 --> 15:40.840
You're too smart

15:40.965 --> 15:45.302
to let a meddlesome female
shake your faith, Bing Partridge.

15:47.179 --> 15:49.724
- You really think I'm smart?
- Oh, yes.

15:50.266 --> 15:51.684
Very smart.

15:54.645 --> 15:56.312
And nice.

16:17.751 --> 16:19.418
I'm going to buy that for you.

16:20.586 --> 16:22.964
You know, for your dorm at RISD.

16:25.341 --> 16:28.219
Are you knocking the Bob Ross
School of Landscape painting?

16:28.343 --> 16:31.138
Never. I'm merely planning a gift.

16:31.263 --> 16:35.601
Good, because my grandmother and I
lived for his happy trees, thank you.

16:36.894 --> 16:38.604
Did she teach you to paint?

16:40.814 --> 16:44.610
Yeah, her, Bob Ross,
comic collection, I guess...

16:45.819 --> 16:47.613
Simpler times.

16:48.447 --> 16:49.615
Were they?

16:50.323 --> 16:52.451
You know, nostalgia is a funny thing.

16:52.867 --> 16:56.622
Makes the past seem better,
like something it never was.

16:59.832 --> 17:01.751
My dad is picking me up
in a few minutes.

17:01.877 --> 17:03.461
Walk me to the corner?

17:03.586 --> 17:05.671
That's right. Bike Week.

17:06.839 --> 17:08.215
Stay with me.

17:10.718 --> 17:13.054
I need a new bike,
and I promised my dad.

17:19.142 --> 17:20.352
What's wrong?

17:21.603 --> 17:23.396
I don't think you owe him anything.

17:25.857 --> 17:29.861
I'm not going because I owe him.
He's my dad. I like him.

17:30.403 --> 17:32.072
I think you deserve better.

17:34.074 --> 17:36.409
- You don't know him.
- Only what you've told me.

17:36.493 --> 17:38.537
That he couldn't help me
with financial aid?

17:38.620 --> 17:40.288
That he walked out on you.

17:41.080 --> 17:44.667
Well, at least he didn't send me
away to boarding school.

17:45.835 --> 17:47.837
My parents want me
to have a good education.

17:47.920 --> 17:49.880
Just because my father's
not a doctor...

17:49.964 --> 17:53.342
You don't have to be a doctor to show
up when your kid's in the hospital.

17:54.510 --> 17:56.887
I'm sorry. I don't understand
how he could do that.

17:57.012 --> 17:58.931
My parents
have always been there for me.

18:00.683 --> 18:03.644
Well, good for you and your parents.

18:04.854 --> 18:07.189
I think it's probably easier
to be there for people

18:07.314 --> 18:09.524
when there is money in the bank,
food on the table

18:09.607 --> 18:11.860
and the heat hasn't been
shut off in January.

18:12.360 --> 18:15.531
I bet it's a lot fricking easier
to be there for your kids

18:15.655 --> 18:18.033
when you get married after college
and med school,

18:18.157 --> 18:19.534
and backpacking abroad,

18:19.617 --> 18:22.453
instead of after teenage pregnancy
and two tours in the Gulf.

18:23.454 --> 18:25.248
It's also easier
when you're not drunk.

18:27.834 --> 18:30.503
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.
- Yes you did.

18:49.062 --> 18:51.814
- Where's Tiffany?
- Just us, Brat.

18:52.274 --> 18:53.274
Ready?

18:54.109 --> 18:55.319
Always.

19:14.837 --> 19:17.173
This is where we found Big Red,
remember?

19:18.049 --> 19:21.177
Yep. You said it was too big for me.

19:21.635 --> 19:22.969
Well, it was.

19:23.554 --> 19:26.432
But you lit up like a Christmas tree
when you rode the damn thing.

19:26.515 --> 19:27.642
I had to get it for you.

19:30.560 --> 19:32.354
It was fun then, you know?

19:34.731 --> 19:36.191
Things were simpler.

19:41.196 --> 19:43.530
Hey, you want to hit
the Broken Spoke?

19:46.033 --> 19:47.493
No, let's find a bike.

19:48.036 --> 19:49.120
Alright.

20:26.322 --> 20:27.532
Ma'am?

20:31.953 --> 20:33.413
Are you the proprietress?

20:37.333 --> 20:41.795
I need to buy a water pump
for a 1938 Rolls-Royce Wraith.

20:50.637 --> 20:54.266
Yeah. Grandpa's real tired
after a long drive.

20:55.308 --> 20:57.394
He needs a rest to feel his best.

21:01.189 --> 21:05.444
I think I got a Wraith water pump
laying around here somewheres.

21:05.986 --> 21:08.113
Let me double-check the inventory.

21:08.238 --> 21:10.866
Meantime,
get that contraption off there.

21:41.061 --> 21:43.188
Hey, Maggie.

21:44.314 --> 21:46.274
A Wraith's surfaced in Nebraska.

21:49.277 --> 21:50.403
Did you hear what I said?

21:51.988 --> 21:53.281
You were right.

21:53.989 --> 21:57.535
Our junkyard lady phoned it in.
Local uniforms are on their way.

21:58.828 --> 22:00.704
They're going to catch that bastard.

22:07.044 --> 22:08.712
What the hell are you doing out here?

22:12.382 --> 22:13.884
Maggie?

22:22.350 --> 22:23.893
Oh, Mags...

22:26.521 --> 22:27.772
No.

22:27.897 --> 22:30.483
Hey. Not this shit again, Maggie.

22:32.319 --> 22:33.821
Come on.

22:35.155 --> 22:36.323
Come on.

22:36.948 --> 22:39.742
Let's get you home. Come on.

22:42.411 --> 22:44.705
Very high performance. Very fast.

22:44.831 --> 22:48.208
They don't really make 'em slow,
do they? What do you think?

22:56.675 --> 22:58.177
Yeah. Get on.

23:00.137 --> 23:01.638
Fire her up.

23:03.348 --> 23:04.724
This could be the one.

23:06.560 --> 23:08.478
You can go ahead
and give her a test ride.

23:19.948 --> 23:21.991
Thank you,
but it's not what I'm looking for.

23:22.116 --> 23:25.453
Brat, that's a great bike.
It's even better than your old one.

23:27.955 --> 23:30.833
We've been looking at bikes all day.
You've got to eat to live.

23:30.958 --> 23:33.127
Come on. Broken Spoke, let's go.

23:37.089 --> 23:38.340
Let's go!

23:41.134 --> 23:43.179
I don't know
what you're looking for, Brat.

23:43.678 --> 23:45.597
That bike is
frickin' perfect for you.

23:48.850 --> 23:50.685
Good thing you ordered two.

23:51.477 --> 23:53.146
You sound like Linda.

23:54.814 --> 23:56.608
You know how the service is, here.

23:56.733 --> 24:00.361
It's slower than a three-legged dog
chasing its tail in a snowstorm.

24:03.031 --> 24:04.115
Look...

24:05.782 --> 24:07.535
I'm with you, alright?

24:07.660 --> 24:09.412
It was lousy of Linda
to sell your bike

24:09.536 --> 24:12.247
and it was lousy
that I didn't stop her, alright?

24:13.749 --> 24:17.212
Guess I've been screwing up pretty
good in the dad department lately.

24:17.794 --> 24:20.088
- I'm sorry.
- You already apologized.

24:21.924 --> 24:23.926
Guess I'm apologizing again.

24:26.511 --> 24:28.263
I'm so proud of you.

24:29.431 --> 24:31.350
And when you wanted
to move in with me...

24:36.521 --> 24:38.314
I'm sorry that it didn't work out.

24:39.649 --> 24:42.652
Hey, you want, like,
a frappe or something?

24:42.777 --> 24:44.904
- Excuse me!
- You know what, I'll take a beer.

24:45.738 --> 24:48.783
I'll take two.
You know how the service is here.

25:26.361 --> 25:27.194
Hello?

25:27.319 --> 25:30.239
Come visit us in Christmasland,
Vic McQueen.

25:30.364 --> 25:33.285
Take your bridge
and bring us something to eat.

25:33.410 --> 25:35.494
Who the hell is this?
Is Haley with you?

25:35.577 --> 25:37.496
If you so much as
touch a hair on her head...

25:37.621 --> 25:39.707
Haley is my friend, you dumb cow.

25:40.291 --> 25:44.378
She's right here with me.
Come to Christmasland.

25:45.004 --> 25:47.339
Father hasn't been here in ages.

25:47.464 --> 25:49.007
We're waiting for you.

25:49.591 --> 25:51.385
And we are hungry.

25:52.469 --> 25:54.096
Cat got your tongue?

25:54.220 --> 25:56.848
Poor old Vic McQueen,

25:56.973 --> 25:59.892
her father a drunk,
her mother real mean.

26:00.018 --> 26:04.022
Early motherhood awaits her
with no man to wed her,

26:04.147 --> 26:07.525
unless she can find it within
to give thanks

26:07.650 --> 26:11.529
to her new friend and savior,
Millie Manx.

26:36.844 --> 26:38.638
Look what the wind blew in.

26:39.472 --> 26:40.806
How was the nut-house?

26:41.433 --> 26:43.434
Yeah, real nice.
You'd have fit right in.

26:47.271 --> 26:49.231
Hey, I got you a souvenir.

26:50.524 --> 26:52.693
It's... a commemorative pin.

26:58.449 --> 26:59.825
Shit.

27:11.212 --> 27:13.546
Why did you get me Big Red
at Bike Week when I was a kid?

27:14.255 --> 27:15.548
I told you.

27:17.092 --> 27:20.095
It was because I lit up
like a Christmas tree when I saw it?

27:20.762 --> 27:21.679
Yeah.

27:22.097 --> 27:23.390
That's a lie.

27:24.933 --> 27:28.353
You had just had a huge,
drunken fight with Ma.

27:28.477 --> 27:31.063
Beer, vodka, screaming...

27:31.188 --> 27:32.398
bruises.

27:36.235 --> 27:38.363
You didn't think I heard
but we live in a box.

27:38.446 --> 27:39.864
Of course I fricking heard you.

27:39.989 --> 27:43.033
Even though we all denied it,
you and I both knew I heard it all.

27:43.158 --> 27:45.619
You knew I knew,
so you bought the bike as an apology

27:45.744 --> 27:47.329
to make up for your shit with Mom.

27:48.747 --> 27:50.541
The bike didn't make up
for anything,

27:50.666 --> 27:53.335
and your apology today
doesn't make up for abandoning me,

27:53.460 --> 27:56.879
or not visiting me in the hospital,
or any of the other billions of ways

27:57.004 --> 27:58.464
you have chosen booze over me.

27:58.548 --> 28:00.092
Only a child would think it does.

28:00.217 --> 28:03.137
What? Drinking these beers
and making a big scene like this,

28:03.262 --> 28:05.848
that makes you sophisticated
or something? An adult?

28:05.972 --> 28:08.475
It's not my job to be the adult.

28:09.058 --> 28:10.643
It's not my job.

28:23.614 --> 28:25.740
I hope that you never have
to feel what it's like

28:25.825 --> 28:27.535
to disappoint people that you love.

28:32.707 --> 28:35.292
You keep drinking
like your old man here...

28:36.084 --> 28:38.171
I guarantee you will find out.

28:49.806 --> 28:50.849
Hey, Vic!

28:52.558 --> 28:54.561
Vic. You alright?

28:55.896 --> 28:59.690
My father is a drunk
and my mother sold my bike.

28:59.816 --> 29:01.859
I can't access my bridge
without my bike.

29:01.984 --> 29:03.945
Without my bridge
I can't ever save Haley.

29:04.029 --> 29:07.198
And I thought I could find another
bike or another knife with my father,

29:07.323 --> 29:10.075
but my father is fricking useless.
He has been all along...

29:10.201 --> 29:12.995
Hey, I don't care about him.
I don't care about him.

29:13.119 --> 29:15.331
I don't care about your bridge
or Haley.

29:16.080 --> 29:17.373
Are you alright?

29:21.754 --> 29:23.214
Are you alright?

29:32.680 --> 29:34.390
You got me a souvenir.

29:38.853 --> 29:39.979
Yeah.

29:42.190 --> 29:44.943
It's a... commemorative pin.

29:45.068 --> 29:46.236
Let me see.

30:06.964 --> 30:08.423
I know it's...

30:10.634 --> 30:12.427
I know it's corny.

30:14.053 --> 30:15.346
I love it.

30:18.391 --> 30:19.684
Can you take me home?

30:22.019 --> 30:23.354
Yeah.

30:26.315 --> 30:27.149
Come on.

30:48.044 --> 30:49.754
Nearly there, Mr. Manx.

30:55.927 --> 30:58.095
Bing! Hurry!

31:04.102 --> 31:08.230
That's right, you son of a bitch.
I remember you.

31:09.982 --> 31:13.277
I know in my bones
you took my son and my grandson.

31:13.402 --> 31:14.945
You're going to die here.

31:15.070 --> 31:16.530
Or in jail.

31:17.156 --> 31:18.949
You little rat-face.

31:20.367 --> 31:21.785
OK, I got it.

31:23.454 --> 31:24.996
Fill it.

31:29.501 --> 31:30.710
Mr. Manx...

31:31.711 --> 31:34.172
promise me you won't murder me
like Peter Ives.

31:34.672 --> 31:37.383
Promise me you'll take me with you
to Christmasland.

31:40.511 --> 31:43.806
Dear boy, I cannot take you anywhere

31:43.931 --> 31:46.225
if we are in prison.

31:58.487 --> 31:59.946
Start the car.

32:49.829 --> 32:53.164
You feign concern
over your son and grandson

32:53.289 --> 32:55.500
but I know the truth, Judith Miller.

32:56.918 --> 32:59.587
Where there should have been
the warmth of a mother's love,

32:59.713 --> 33:02.590
young Robert was met
only with sour chewing tobacco

33:02.716 --> 33:04.008
and motor grease.

33:13.976 --> 33:16.603
Robert Junior is very happy
in Christmasland, Judith,

33:16.729 --> 33:18.814
but Robert Senior, he took after you.

33:18.939 --> 33:20.984
He was a terrible parent.

33:21.608 --> 33:23.736
Leave the old bitch
to die as she lived:

33:23.861 --> 33:26.655
all alone and surrounded by refuse.

33:28.073 --> 33:30.199
Let's away, Mr. Partridge.

33:37.708 --> 33:39.084
They're going to get us.

33:39.709 --> 33:40.960
Patience, Bing.

34:01.814 --> 34:03.107
They don't see us.

34:06.401 --> 34:08.277
They don't notice us.

34:32.177 --> 34:34.513
Hey, Ma. Vic's here.

34:43.395 --> 34:44.855
Just come on back.

34:59.619 --> 35:00.870
Hey, Tiff.

35:01.371 --> 35:02.497
Tiffany?

36:32.042 --> 36:34.294
When did I give you this,
third grade?

36:37.255 --> 36:38.298
Second.

37:01.862 --> 37:03.613
When was the last time you slept?

37:07.241 --> 37:09.578
When they sedated me in the hospital.

37:12.122 --> 37:14.332
Which was, like,
a thousand years ago.

37:29.806 --> 37:31.807
- Ready?
- Yeah.

37:40.399 --> 37:41.692
You alright?

37:43.527 --> 37:44.903
You're good.

38:48.547 --> 38:49.923
Joe?

38:55.054 --> 38:58.015
I'm sorry I'm such an ass.
You don't have to do all this.

39:23.039 --> 39:24.290
Joe?

40:00.700 --> 40:02.661
Wait here, Mr. Partridge.

40:05.455 --> 40:06.706
But...

40:08.332 --> 40:11.460
Why can't I go inside? You promised.

40:12.336 --> 40:16.549
That's true, and I haven't broken
a promise in over a hundred years.

40:17.050 --> 40:18.551
But we made a deal.

40:18.676 --> 40:22.513
You may enter Christmasland
only after we save ten children,

40:22.638 --> 40:25.975
and then only if you remain
on my nice list.

40:26.516 --> 40:28.060
Am I still on the nice list?

40:28.144 --> 40:29.478
You're right to be concerned,

40:29.562 --> 40:32.356
after the shenanigans you pulled
at that old bat's scrapyard.

40:32.481 --> 40:34.107
I'm really sorry.

40:34.232 --> 40:37.819
You allowed Vic McQueen
to poison your mind.

40:38.611 --> 40:42.031
She's a dangerous one.
You must take better care.

40:42.615 --> 40:44.826
I will. I will, sir.

40:45.952 --> 40:47.620
Well, go on, Mr. Partridge.

40:48.120 --> 40:50.623
We'll get to work
after I've made this delivery.

40:59.591 --> 41:01.800
Your time will come, Bing.

41:02.426 --> 41:03.886
Thank you, Mr. Manx.

41:49.805 --> 41:51.681
More gingerbread gas?

42:01.024 --> 42:02.400
Where are we?

42:04.069 --> 42:06.112
A place of wonder and joy.

42:27.007 --> 42:28.467
Come this way.

43:03.167 --> 43:04.752
- Daniel!
- Sheriff Bly!

43:04.877 --> 43:06.337
Here you are!

43:07.422 --> 43:10.549
Look at me, I'm a sheriff.
Howdy, howdy!

43:13.593 --> 43:16.888
Time to play
Scissors for the Drifter.

43:17.014 --> 43:18.056
You're the drifter.

43:37.616 --> 43:40.036
I've missed you, Father.

43:45.750 --> 43:47.835
It's good to be home, child.
