00:30.676 --> 00:33.668
- It's been a long time since we've done this.
- Yeah.

00:34.146 --> 00:37.912
Thought it'd be nice, you know? Something
to keep your mind off of...

00:38.117 --> 00:40.915
It's okay, you can say it,
I'm not gonna break.

00:41.520 --> 00:44.216
Sorry, I've just been kind of out of it lately.

00:44.390 --> 00:46.358
I'm here if you need to talk.

00:46.859 --> 00:49.419
There's one thing I wanted to ask you.

00:50.029 --> 00:52.623
Would you be my date
to the spring formal?

00:53.399 --> 00:55.867
Of course. You didn't have to ask.

00:56.736 --> 00:59.034
I guess I'm not taking anything
for granted anymore.

01:19.926 --> 01:25.523
This is Watts and Vertigo, we have a gas fire
just off Route Twelve, mile marker 18.

01:31.137 --> 01:32.934
Whitney, look!

01:35.274 --> 01:37.037
- Hey!
- Hey!

01:37.743 --> 01:41.270
- Lana, get out of here. Run!
- Whitney, don't! Don't!

01:42.481 --> 01:44.108
Look at the pipe!

01:45.685 --> 01:47.084
Everybody, clear on out!

01:47.253 --> 01:50.780
Lana, get out of here! Go, run!

02:02.902 --> 02:04.426
- Lana!
- Get down!

02:23.189 --> 02:25.521
Lana? Lana!

02:35.101 --> 02:37.194
Hey, I just heard, is she all right?

02:37.370 --> 02:40.498
Yeah. They gave her something
to help her rest.

02:40.706 --> 02:42.674
How you holding up?

02:42.842 --> 02:46.039
Kind of hoped I'd seen my last
hospital room in a while.

02:47.046 --> 02:48.946
Hey. Hey!

02:52.385 --> 02:56.378
- I thought you'd be halfway to Metropolis.
- It's just an internship, I can reschedule.

02:56.555 --> 02:58.785
You've been waiting for that interview
for weeks.

02:58.958 --> 03:01.324
I know, I just feel weird taking off right now.

03:01.560 --> 03:03.152
Lana's gonna be okay.

03:03.329 --> 03:05.126
It's just a mild concussion.

03:05.297 --> 03:09.961
<i>I'm crashing in my cousin's dorm. Call me
if anything goes wrong with the Torch.</i>

03:10.169 --> 03:12.262
We can survive one day without you.

03:12.872 --> 03:14.362
You gonna wish me luck?

03:14.974 --> 03:16.635
You don't need it.

03:18.411 --> 03:20.572
- All right. Bye.
- Bye.

03:32.091 --> 03:33.388
Can I buy you a coffee?

03:33.959 --> 03:35.290
Yeah.

04:15.968 --> 04:17.230
Chloe!

05:13.725 --> 05:17.092
Okay, well, I'll let you know. Bye.

05:17.729 --> 05:20.129
- Who was that, the plumber?
- No, your school.

05:20.299 --> 05:25.236
Don't worry. You're not in trouble. They're
looking for chaperones for the spring formal.

05:25.404 --> 05:28.999
- Oh, what'd you say?
- I said you hadn't even mentioned it.

05:29.174 --> 05:31.608
I don't think the whole tux-and-limo thing
is for me.

05:31.777 --> 05:35.975
- Besides, it's customary to have a date.
- It's customary to ask someone.

05:36.148 --> 05:38.048
Martha, stay out of it.

05:38.217 --> 05:40.947
Son, can you get that trap
out of there for me?

05:41.119 --> 05:43.087
Uh, sure, Dad.

05:47.559 --> 05:48.821
Thank you.

05:49.127 --> 05:52.358
So, are you planning on asking Chloe or not?

05:53.265 --> 05:55.756
She just can't help herself.

05:55.934 --> 05:57.868
Don't use the sink until I
get back.

05:58.036 --> 06:00.971
- I'm not sure.
- Well, you said you had feelings for her.

06:01.139 --> 06:03.471
It's not about Chloe.

06:03.642 --> 06:07.408
You can't keep putting your life
on hold because of Lana.

06:08.280 --> 06:11.977
But if she sees me with someone else,
it's like I'm saying the door's closed.

06:12.150 --> 06:13.617
The door is closed, Clark.

06:14.419 --> 06:16.717
You need to admit that to yourself.

06:19.858 --> 06:21.917
Hi, Lex, come on in.

06:22.461 --> 06:25.862
Sorry to barge in. I came by
to see you and Mr. Kent.

06:26.031 --> 06:28.158
Oh, I'll go get him.

06:30.369 --> 06:31.666
- In a hurry?
- Yeah.

06:31.837 --> 06:35.705
<i>I'm taking over at the Torch while Chloe's
out of town. Catch up with you later.</i>

06:37.009 --> 06:38.374
- Hi, Lex.
- Hey.

06:38.544 --> 06:40.102
What can I do for you?

06:40.279 --> 06:43.407
The paperwork on the chemical spill
finally came through.

06:43.582 --> 06:45.379
I never thought I'd see the day.

06:45.551 --> 06:49.612
Since the dumping wasn't done by an actual
LuthorCorp employee, it did require...

06:49.788 --> 06:51.813
...jumping through some corporate hoops.

06:52.057 --> 06:54.787
The accident was unfortunate.
I know your...

06:55.027 --> 06:57.325
...loss can't be fixed entirely
with money, but...

06:58.196 --> 07:00.187
...I hope this helps.

07:01.633 --> 07:03.225
Well, I...

07:03.602 --> 07:05.900
...appreciate the gesture, but...

07:06.505 --> 07:10.066
Hope we're not getting special treatment
because of your friendship with Clark.

07:10.242 --> 07:12.802
I assure you, Mr. Kent, that
has nothing to do with this.

07:12.978 --> 07:16.072
- This is very generous, Lex.
- Actually, it isn't.

07:16.248 --> 07:20.514
It reflects the exact value of the herd and
grazing land you lost. I wouldn't insult you...

07:20.686 --> 07:25.180
...by putting you in my debt. All I want is
to leave the doubt between us in the past.

07:40.305 --> 07:43.035
Hey. How you feeling?

07:43.208 --> 07:46.200
Better. Now it only hurts
when I walk, sit, or breathe.

07:47.579 --> 07:51.982
I'm surprised to see you. Usually a hospital
visit comes with a "get out of jail free" card.

07:52.250 --> 07:54.411
Actually, I was looking for Chloe.

07:54.586 --> 07:56.986
Not here. She's in Metropolis until tonight.

07:57.556 --> 08:00.548
- You covering?
- Well, if you can call it that.

08:00.726 --> 08:05.493
The printer's jammed, the scanner's broken,
and the spring formal schedule is late.

08:05.664 --> 08:09.600
<i>Chloe leaves for a day and the Torch
goes down in flames.</i>

08:09.768 --> 08:12.965
Safe to say we won't lose you to the
entrancing world of journalism.

08:14.306 --> 08:15.933
So have you talked to Chloe?

08:16.108 --> 08:18.338
I left a message on her cell phone.

08:18.510 --> 08:22.537
<i>I think she's busy convincing the Planet they
were insane ever to publish without her.</i>

08:24.116 --> 08:25.811
What's up?

08:26.018 --> 08:29.954
I had this intense dream about Chloe
I just can't shake.

08:30.188 --> 08:34.022
It was totally surreal, but I dreamed she
was attacked outside of the hospital.

08:34.192 --> 08:37.058
I know. It sounds crazy.

08:37.895 --> 08:39.625
It's got you freaked.

08:40.265 --> 08:42.357
It's just, it felt like I was right there.

08:42.768 --> 08:47.330
She was walking to her car and getting her
keys out of that red bag with the butterflies.

08:48.240 --> 08:49.639
What is it?

08:49.875 --> 08:53.868
She was carrying that red bag
when she left the hospital.

08:55.814 --> 08:58.408
Do you want me to call her dad
to see if she's all right?

08:59.184 --> 09:01.516
You know, I'm sure it's just the concussion.

09:01.687 --> 09:04.383
Don't want to scare him because
I was on painkillers.

09:04.556 --> 09:06.148
Yeah, it was probably a nightmare.

09:06.792 --> 09:08.851
I'll see you later.

09:17.436 --> 09:19.063
Lex?

09:19.604 --> 09:24.200
Since I didn't call you, and I haven't heard of
any three-headed sheep born in Smallville...

09:24.409 --> 09:28.004
<i>- ... what brings the Inquisitor here?
- We need to talk.</i>

09:28.180 --> 09:30.080
I seriously doubt that.

09:30.248 --> 09:33.775
Seems you've given out gifts
to the competition.

09:34.152 --> 09:36.279
Now, we had an arrangement.

09:36.455 --> 09:39.982
You give me stories, I give you information.

09:40.459 --> 09:43.587
Now, what did Carrie Castle do for you
that I couldn't?

09:45.530 --> 09:48.192
She gave me a pretty mean shiatsu massage.

09:50.001 --> 09:52.265
Well, mock all you want, Lex.

09:52.437 --> 09:56.771
It just means I've had to take the initiative,
develop my own leads.

09:56.942 --> 10:00.378
There's a story here in Smallville,
and I am going to make my name on it.

10:02.681 --> 10:05.241
I thought my position was clear.

10:05.417 --> 10:10.081
I don't want you near the Kents. They're
off-limits, they're under my protection.

10:10.255 --> 10:12.689
And what about the meteors?

10:12.858 --> 10:15.588
- Are they under your protection?
- Do you have something?

10:16.027 --> 10:20.327
I found a man who had a very
interesting view of the meteor shower.

10:20.499 --> 10:24.094
Claims he saw something
fall out of the sky.

10:24.269 --> 10:26.032
We all did.

10:26.204 --> 10:28.604
Yeah, well, not like this.

10:31.843 --> 10:35.108
If you're feeling so abused,
why are you bringing this to me?

10:35.280 --> 10:40.183
Getting the full story takes money
and access, and unlike some...

10:40.352 --> 10:43.150
...I always hold up my end of the deal.

10:43.922 --> 10:46.220
Get ready to thank me.

11:06.511 --> 11:09.139
Hey, hey, Clark.

11:09.314 --> 11:11.043
Take it easy, would you?

11:11.216 --> 11:14.447
- Thing's been in our family a long time.
- Stupid thing won't start!

11:14.619 --> 11:16.177
Clark.

11:16.354 --> 11:19.653
- What's going on, son?
- I'm worried.

11:19.825 --> 11:25.229
I'm sure Chloe's going to call and you'll
realize you've been worried about nothing.

11:25.931 --> 11:27.421
Yeah.

11:29.534 --> 11:31.468
I'm glad we'll finally be rid of this.

11:31.636 --> 11:34.070
We spend more time fixing it than riding it.

11:34.239 --> 11:38.676
Well, I'm not sure that I'm quite
ready to retire the old girl yet.

11:38.844 --> 11:41.335
Well, with Lex's check
we can get a new one.

11:41.980 --> 11:44.471
Actually, I haven't decided
to deposit that check.

11:44.716 --> 11:46.707
Dad, Lex is trying to do the right thing.

11:46.885 --> 11:48.853
I know he is, Clark. I know he didn't...

11:49.020 --> 11:53.787
...try to buy me off. He's just trying to repay
for damages. You're right, I've got no real...

11:54.059 --> 11:57.995
...reason to doubt him, it's just,
something in my gut tells me I should.

11:58.163 --> 12:01.223
Lex isn't perfect, Dad, I know that.

12:01.399 --> 12:03.959
But slamming the door in his face
over and over...

12:04.135 --> 12:07.935
...only helps turn him into exactly
what you think he already is.

12:09.307 --> 12:11.741
When did you get to be so wise?

12:12.177 --> 12:14.077
Ask my dad.

12:14.312 --> 12:15.677
I'll sleep on it.

12:22.153 --> 12:23.950
Hey, Clark.

12:24.122 --> 12:25.714
- Talked to Chloe yet?
- No...

12:25.891 --> 12:28.416
<i>...but the Planet better not have
turned her down.</i>

12:28.593 --> 12:30.720
Just thought she would have
called by now.

12:30.896 --> 12:34.889
She probably already got the internship
and is out partying with her cousin.

12:35.066 --> 12:36.761
So, did I mention...

12:36.935 --> 12:40.393
- ... I'm taking Erica Fox to the spring formal?
- Several times, yes.

12:40.572 --> 12:44.565
The hottest girl in our class. Just
want to make sure that was clear.

12:44.743 --> 12:47.803
- It is.
- So, want to know my secret? You do.

12:47.979 --> 12:53.542
I asked her. You ought to try it. Getting up
off your butt. It's the wave of the future.

12:53.852 --> 12:57.344
I've gotta go reserve my limo
for the spring formal.

12:57.522 --> 13:01.117
To which, incidentally, I'm taking Erica Fox!

13:01.293 --> 13:03.022
I hadn't heard.

13:03.828 --> 13:05.523
Any word on our intrepid reporter?

13:05.697 --> 13:08.393
I called her dad. He was stuck in a seminar.

13:08.667 --> 13:11.500
- I'm sure she'll be okay.
- Yeah, me too.

13:13.438 --> 13:15.235
You can buy tickets to the formal here.

13:15.407 --> 13:17.534
- That's a cool idea.
- You ask anyone yet?

13:18.243 --> 13:19.642
I've got my eye on someone.

13:20.245 --> 13:24.045
Well, you'd better hurry up. No one
likes to look for a dress last minute.

13:26.318 --> 13:27.785
Not even Chloe.

13:28.853 --> 13:31.344
What makes you think I'm asking Chloe?

13:56.614 --> 13:57.979
Lana.

13:58.149 --> 14:00.617
- It happened again.
- You saw something.

14:00.785 --> 14:05.722
I saw Chloe. Somebody's got her.
You have to believe me, Clark.

14:13.431 --> 14:17.060
Come on, Chloe, come on.

14:17.369 --> 14:22.068
You've been through worse than this.
Come on, Chloe. Okay, maybe you're lying.

14:55.440 --> 14:57.032
Home sweet home.

15:08.353 --> 15:12.289
Hey, guys. I called the sheriff's office
because I wanted them to hear this too.

15:12.490 --> 15:14.287
Any luck reaching Chloe, Mr. Sullivan?

15:14.459 --> 15:17.223
No, I haven't heard from her.
I'm starting to get concerned.

15:17.395 --> 15:19.693
I called her cousin, but I get the machine.

15:19.864 --> 15:22.799
You said you had proof Chloe
might've been abducted?

15:22.967 --> 15:24.457
Well, I sort of had a vision.

15:24.636 --> 15:26.331
A vision.

15:26.638 --> 15:28.037
She saw Chloe being kidnapped.

15:28.206 --> 15:31.403
Maybe you should have called the Psychic
Friends Network instead then.

15:32.010 --> 15:33.602
What makes you think it was real?

15:33.778 --> 15:36.212
I saw Chloe bound and blindfolded
in a dark room.

15:36.381 --> 15:40.044
Well, too bad you didn't see something
a little more useful, like an address...

15:40.218 --> 15:41.845
...where we might find her.

15:42.754 --> 15:45.086
- Excuse me.
- Ms. Lang...

15:45.256 --> 15:47.520
...you went through a rough
ordeal yesterday.

15:47.692 --> 15:50.183
Are you sure you're feeling okay?

15:50.361 --> 15:52.591
You mean, do I think I'm hallucinating?

15:52.764 --> 15:56.131
I felt like I was there, like I was seeing
through the kidnapper's eyes.

15:56.301 --> 15:59.429
- We'll take this seriously, and look into it.
- Thanks.

16:01.406 --> 16:03.271
Mr. Sullivan? What is it?

16:05.643 --> 16:08.271
They found Chloe's car.

16:08.446 --> 16:10.004
It's been abandoned in the woods.

16:32.904 --> 16:35.532
So far, I'm unimpressed.

16:35.707 --> 16:38.005
Reserve judgment for five minutes.

16:38.176 --> 16:40.144
- Starting now.
- Mr. Cole, this is-

16:40.311 --> 16:43.280
Lex Luthor. I know who he is.

16:43.448 --> 16:45.939
He's very interested in your story.

16:46.284 --> 16:49.117
12 years ago, Eddie had more clients
than he could handle.

16:49.921 --> 16:53.118
Spent eight hours a day dusting fields
all over Smallville.

16:53.291 --> 16:54.724
And then?

16:54.893 --> 16:56.827
FAA pulled my license.

16:57.395 --> 16:59.022
And why would they do that?

16:59.197 --> 17:02.428
Decided I wasn't fit in the head
to fly anymore.

17:03.034 --> 17:05.798
Because I couldn't keep my dumb
mouth shut.

17:07.305 --> 17:09.432
What were your rates for cropdusting,
Mr. Cole?

17:09.607 --> 17:11.733
600 a day.

17:14.612 --> 17:16.772
I'd very much like to hear your story.

17:22.686 --> 17:26.384
I was up in my prop,
dusting the Bakers' field.

17:26.558 --> 17:29.288
Fifty acres of sweet corn. When it happened.

17:29.928 --> 17:31.395
The meteors?

17:31.563 --> 17:36.591
It was like lightning, all around.
Pretty sure I was going to die right there.

17:38.236 --> 17:39.726
Then one...

17:41.072 --> 17:44.132
...just missed my tail by about 10 feet.

17:44.976 --> 17:49.640
I saw it go straight down, and then
swerve just before it hit.

17:53.284 --> 17:55.013
Doesn't sound like a meteor.

17:56.754 --> 17:59.951
I know aircraft better than most.

18:00.625 --> 18:03.651
The way that thing moved,
it had to be a ship.

18:06.130 --> 18:07.654
You saw a ship crash?

18:08.299 --> 18:11.700
Well, it's not just that I saw a ship crash.

18:11.869 --> 18:16.499
Couple hours later, went to look for it.
It was gone.

18:18.810 --> 18:20.072
Maybe it burned.

18:20.411 --> 18:22.971
Or maybe it was taken.

18:23.147 --> 18:24.808
Nobody believes me.

18:24.983 --> 18:29.079
Gave Mr. Nixon a map of the crash site.

18:29.921 --> 18:31.183
I've seen it.

18:32.757 --> 18:34.054
So you believe me?

18:35.260 --> 18:36.591
It's a good story.

18:39.464 --> 18:40.897
Thanks for your time, Mr. Cole.

18:47.071 --> 18:48.060
Hey!

18:48.239 --> 18:51.436
Thought you'd be pleased. I brought
the story you've been waiting for.

18:51.609 --> 18:54.134
You brought me a desperate man
and a tall tale.

18:54.312 --> 18:57.145
It's about what I expected from you.

18:57.315 --> 19:00.182
Sorry, Rog, time's up.

19:20.538 --> 19:22.665
Any word on Chloe?

19:25.209 --> 19:29.339
My dad and I went out with
Mr. Sullivan and the police.

19:29.847 --> 19:33.908
We searched the woods but
we didn't find anything.

19:35.153 --> 19:37.621
They've organized a search party,
tomorrow morning.

19:39.924 --> 19:41.516
How you doing?

19:42.126 --> 19:45.721
Spent the afternoon at the sheriff's station
telling them what I saw.

19:45.897 --> 19:48.457
Kept looking at me like I was crazy.

19:51.035 --> 19:52.969
I don't think you're crazy.

19:56.941 --> 19:58.602
How are you holding up?

20:02.113 --> 20:04.581
I keep wishing Chloe would just
walk up those steps.

20:06.351 --> 20:09.445
I never appreciated how much
she meant to me until now.

20:09.620 --> 20:12.612
- The thought of never seeing her again-
- Clark.

20:12.790 --> 20:14.917
You can't think that way.

20:21.499 --> 20:23.592
You know, I remember the first time
I met her.

20:23.768 --> 20:25.360
It was eighth grade.

20:25.970 --> 20:31.237
She'd just transferred from Metropolis
and I was assigned to show her around.

20:31.709 --> 20:34.837
<i>She wanted to know where
she could buy a copy of the Planet...</i>

20:35.012 --> 20:37.503
...so she could keep in touch
with civilization.

20:39.283 --> 20:44.653
When she found out I lived on a farm, she
insisted I invite her over to experience it.

20:44.822 --> 20:46.847
I think she thought I was Amish.

20:52.029 --> 20:54.054
When I brought her up here...

20:56.167 --> 20:58.635
...she just kissed me, right out of the blue.

20:59.237 --> 21:00.534
Why'd she do that?

21:00.805 --> 21:03.137
She said, "I know you've been thinking
about that...

21:03.307 --> 21:05.969
...so I figured we'd get it out of the way
and be friends. "

21:09.213 --> 21:11.443
It was my first kiss.

21:14.218 --> 21:17.551
It's nice it was with someone
you still care about.

21:23.094 --> 21:24.755
We're going to see her again, Clark.

21:44.348 --> 21:45.679
Lana?

21:49.921 --> 21:52.856
- I just saw her again.
- Chloe? Where?

21:53.024 --> 21:56.118
- Buried. She's still alive.
- Did you see where she was?

21:56.294 --> 21:58.626
I'm not sure, but there was
a windmill. A big one.

21:59.230 --> 22:04.224
She must be out in Chandler's Field.
I'll get help!

22:46.811 --> 22:48.574
Chloe? Chloe!

22:50.681 --> 22:52.808
- Chloe, it's okay! It's okay.
- Clark!

22:53.618 --> 22:55.586
Clark.

22:55.753 --> 22:59.519
I knew it was you, it's always you.

23:10.001 --> 23:12.526
Thanks, I appreciate that.

23:12.704 --> 23:15.696
I gotta go. Some real people
just came in.

23:18.610 --> 23:20.976
- Who was that?
- The Daily Planet.

23:21.145 --> 23:23.841
Thought you missed your appointment
for the internship.

23:24.015 --> 23:26.245
I did. They were calling about an interview.

23:27.385 --> 23:29.444
Are you gonna do it?

23:30.521 --> 23:33.456
<i>No. I've wanted my name in the
Daily Planet, but not like this.</i>

23:33.625 --> 23:36.992
<i>Besides, I figured the Torch could
use an exclusive, which...</i>

23:37.161 --> 23:41.393
...I will write as soon as I get out of here.

23:42.300 --> 23:44.768
Chloe, do you remember anything?

23:47.305 --> 23:49.671
I remember...

23:50.275 --> 23:52.175
...tripping on some metal rails...

23:53.611 --> 23:55.579
...and I remember...

23:56.014 --> 23:59.814
...hundreds of teddy bears
hanging from the ceiling.

24:00.952 --> 24:03.648
Anyway, that's where I was kept until I-

24:05.823 --> 24:11.523
I'm sorry, you guys. Flashback.
I can still hear the dirt falling on the coffin.

24:11.696 --> 24:13.425
Sorry.

24:14.365 --> 24:17.334
If you hadn't found me,
I don't know where I'd be.

24:17.502 --> 24:19.299
Don't thank me, thank Lana.

24:20.772 --> 24:22.103
Yeah, I gotta hand it to you...

24:23.107 --> 24:27.510
...you sure picked a perfect time to take
a walk on the weird side.

24:29.814 --> 24:31.509
You should get some rest.

24:31.916 --> 24:33.440
Clark.

24:35.353 --> 24:37.344
Would you mind sticking around
for a while?

24:37.522 --> 24:39.490
Whoever did this is still out there.

24:40.425 --> 24:42.723
Of course not. I'll stay here
as long as you need.

24:44.329 --> 24:45.694
Thanks.

24:48.066 --> 24:50.899
Okay, well, I guess I'll
see you guys tomorrow.

24:51.135 --> 24:52.397
Bye, Lana.

24:52.570 --> 24:55.334
- Okay.
- Bye.

25:38.649 --> 25:40.549
Glad you could join me.

25:40.718 --> 25:43.619
- How late were you at the hospital?
- All night.

25:43.788 --> 25:45.255
I snuck in after visiting hours.

25:45.456 --> 25:47.890
I'm sure Chloe appreciated that.

25:48.059 --> 25:50.527
I'm worried that the person
who did this is out there.

25:50.695 --> 25:54.756
Clark, you got her back safe and sound.
That's what's important.

25:54.932 --> 25:56.456
Without Lana I wouldn't have.

25:56.634 --> 26:00.400
Hey, she hasn't had any more
visions, has she?

26:00.605 --> 26:06.066
No. I think they're connected to the gas
pipe explosion. That's when they started.

26:06.244 --> 26:12.205
- I'm gonna check that out.
- No, son, let the police do it. It's their job.

26:12.383 --> 26:16.080
- Wish I knew who she was seeing through.
- What you need to focus on right now...

26:16.254 --> 26:18.916
...is getting this truckload of feed
over to the Millers.

26:21.459 --> 26:25.452
So you've had a night to sleep on it,
what are you going to do with Lex's check?

26:25.897 --> 26:27.762
I might be stubborn, but I'm not blind.

26:28.866 --> 26:31.994
Yeah, I had a talk with your mom.

26:32.170 --> 26:34.035
As soon as we deliver the feed...

26:34.205 --> 26:37.902
...I'm taking it to the savings and loan.

27:26.023 --> 27:28.514
- Keep them moving.
- All right.

27:28.993 --> 27:30.551
What's up, Lex?

27:30.862 --> 27:35.322
Considering buying this land for a project,
but I wanted to test the soil first.

27:35.500 --> 27:36.831
Standard operating procedure.

27:37.001 --> 27:41.734
Since when does standard procedure
include metal detectors and HAZMAT suits?

27:42.874 --> 27:46.037
To be honest, there may have been
a major meteor strike on the site.

27:47.979 --> 27:50.038
There's no proof the meteors
were harmful, but-

27:50.214 --> 27:54.275
It never hurts to dot your I's
and cross your T's, right?

27:55.119 --> 27:59.283
LuthorCorp's environmental record has
taken some serious hits in recent weeks.

27:59.457 --> 28:02.290
Better safe than sorry.
Is there a problem?

28:02.460 --> 28:03.722
Dad?

28:04.061 --> 28:06.291
The problem is, Lex, that...

28:06.531 --> 28:09.728
...what's good for LuthorCorp isn't always
what's good for this town.

28:09.934 --> 28:11.265
Mr. Luthor.

28:12.069 --> 28:15.129
Looks like you've got business to attend to.

28:21.913 --> 28:24.438
I've decided I can't accept your money.

28:25.049 --> 28:26.380
Mr. Kent, I don't understand.

28:29.854 --> 28:32.015
I wouldn't expect you would.

28:33.558 --> 28:35.526
- Lex, I-
- It's okay, Clark.

28:35.693 --> 28:37.251
I'll talk to you later.

28:43.401 --> 28:44.993
Dad.

28:45.770 --> 28:47.465
Dad!

28:47.638 --> 28:50.937
Lex didn't deserve that.
People test the land all the time.

28:51.108 --> 28:52.632
I know that, Clark.

28:52.810 --> 28:55.506
But this field is where your ship
crashed down.

28:55.680 --> 28:59.377
If Lex's scientists find anything out here,
they could trace it back to you.

28:59.584 --> 29:02.610
Keep swinging the detector through
until we get a reading.

29:02.787 --> 29:04.254
Come on.

29:08.459 --> 29:10.950
Lex, you gotta see this.

29:19.370 --> 29:21.270
You understand what this could mean.

29:23.507 --> 29:25.168
More than you know.

29:26.811 --> 29:30.679
I want you to handle all the tests
personally, then report directly to me.

29:52.970 --> 29:54.631
- How you feeling?
- Better.

29:54.805 --> 29:57.000
At least the nightmares
seem to have stopped.

29:57.174 --> 29:58.436
I'm glad you came by.

29:58.609 --> 30:03.308
Went home early. Started going through
some of my dad's things.

30:03.481 --> 30:06.644
- Sure you're ready for that?
- It's okay.

30:06.984 --> 30:09.953
It actually brought back
some nice memories.

30:10.454 --> 30:12.012
And I found this.

30:20.665 --> 30:22.724
These were your father's?

30:23.334 --> 30:24.824
Yeah.

30:25.136 --> 30:27.832
I knew he served in Vietnam,
but he never talked about it.

30:28.005 --> 30:29.233
Know what they're for?

30:29.840 --> 30:32.866
Yeah. They keep a registry on the Internet.

30:33.044 --> 30:35.171
Silver star's for exceptional valor.

30:36.113 --> 30:39.173
He rescued three men in his unit
during a firefight.

30:39.350 --> 30:42.251
He was wounded, but he
wouldn't leave his men behind.

30:42.853 --> 30:45.048
Sounds like your dad.

30:45.222 --> 30:46.746
Wonder why he never told you.

30:47.925 --> 30:49.984
Maybe he just did.

30:51.162 --> 30:52.629
You know...

30:52.797 --> 30:58.167
...you win a couple football games
and people start calling you a hero.

30:58.335 --> 31:00.633
It feels good, but...

31:01.372 --> 31:06.105
...maybe he's trying to tell me throwing a
ball isn't the only thing important in life.

31:22.560 --> 31:26.257
Glad to see I'm not the only one
who's curious in Smallville.

31:26.430 --> 31:29.160
Hey, Lex. What are you doing here?

31:29.333 --> 31:32.700
I feel like I owe your father an apology,
but I'm not exactly sure why.

31:33.804 --> 31:35.669
It's not you. It's everything.

31:35.840 --> 31:37.865
Money problems, the farm.

31:38.042 --> 31:40.772
He didn't understand what you
were doing in that field.

31:40.945 --> 31:42.469
I thought I made myself clear.

31:43.547 --> 31:44.946
You did.

31:47.151 --> 31:50.052
You don't believe me either.

31:50.221 --> 31:53.987
I know you get obsessed about things,
like the car accident.

31:54.692 --> 31:58.150
I find it hard to believe you'd waste time
supervising a land survey...

31:58.329 --> 31:59.887
...if that's what it was.

32:01.298 --> 32:03.994
My life changed when the meteors hit,
I need to know why.

32:04.168 --> 32:05.396
Can't let it go?

32:05.569 --> 32:08.732
This isn't some empty emotional quest.
It's about finding the truth.

32:08.906 --> 32:10.464
The truth.

32:12.176 --> 32:14.235
I found a man.

32:14.812 --> 32:17.781
He said something besides the meteors
came down that day.

32:18.716 --> 32:20.650
Like what?

32:21.252 --> 32:22.947
A ship.

32:25.289 --> 32:27.086
And you believe him.

32:27.792 --> 32:29.054
I listened.

32:29.660 --> 32:33.460
Chances are he's another crackpot,
but I'd be remiss if I didn't check it out.

32:34.365 --> 32:37.129
And when the next story crops up,
you'll check that one too.

32:38.169 --> 32:40.296
When are you going to put
your past behind you?

32:42.706 --> 32:44.298
You look at the stars, Clark.

32:44.475 --> 32:47.842
Some of them have been extinguished
for thousands of years...

32:48.012 --> 32:50.913
...but their light is only reaching us now.

32:51.482 --> 32:54.610
Past is always influencing the present.

32:54.785 --> 32:56.980
I can't change that.

32:57.154 --> 32:59.816
All I can do is try to understand it.

33:06.363 --> 33:08.354
Chloe, why aren't you at home sleeping?

33:08.532 --> 33:12.161
If I fall asleep, I'll have nightmares,
so I figure the best thing is keep busy.

33:12.336 --> 33:14.531
God knows you left a mess
for me to clean up.

33:14.705 --> 33:16.730
Well, I'm glad you're here.

33:16.907 --> 33:19.876
Hey, Whitney.
You sure you're in the right place?

33:20.044 --> 33:22.740
Clark called, said he needed my help.

33:22.913 --> 33:25.609
I figured out how Lana got her visions.
The explosion.

33:26.016 --> 33:27.608
You think the blast caused them?

33:27.785 --> 33:30.515
More than that. It connected her
with someone.

33:30.688 --> 33:34.419
Clark Kent leaps tall theories in a single
bound. How did you arrive at this one?

33:34.592 --> 33:37.288
Apparently there were meteor rocks
at the explosion...

33:37.461 --> 33:39.622
...and I found this article.

33:43.267 --> 33:44.598
The De Kretser Syndrome?

33:45.169 --> 33:47.137
It's like a post-traumatic
stress disorder.

33:47.304 --> 33:49.602
There were cases reported
during the London blitz.

33:49.773 --> 33:55.211
People in shelters would find themselves
psychically linked after a bomb hit nearby.

33:55.479 --> 33:56.741
I'm sold.

33:56.914 --> 34:01.874
According to this, it's in times of stress,
anger, or excitement that triggers visions.

34:02.052 --> 34:04.316
Who was around Lana after the explosion?

34:04.555 --> 34:07.080
Myself and two deputies.
Watts and Vertigo.

34:07.258 --> 34:10.091
They were with your dad when
we told them about Lana's vision.

34:10.261 --> 34:13.661
He probably called them himself.
They're in a bowling league together.

34:13.831 --> 34:15.889
Whitney, which one got to her first?

34:16.065 --> 34:18.500
It's tough to say, it all happened so fast.

34:18.668 --> 34:20.466
One of these cops kidnapped Chloe?

34:20.638 --> 34:23.300
Who would suspect a cop?
We have to warn Lana.

34:23.474 --> 34:27.467
If one is the kidnapper, he knows Lana's
seeing through his eyes.

34:27.645 --> 34:32.411
- Great, I'll drive.
- That's okay. We'll take my car.

34:44.661 --> 34:46.493
Miss Lang.

34:49.099 --> 34:52.659
I know it's late, but I just wanted to
ask you a few more questions.

34:53.304 --> 34:55.498
Surprised you found the time.

34:55.672 --> 34:57.800
I know I deserve that.

34:59.043 --> 35:01.375
Do you want a cup of coffee?

35:01.979 --> 35:03.446
Sure.

35:03.614 --> 35:05.172
Okay.

35:34.712 --> 35:38.148
- Where is Lana?
- I don't know, she was here.

35:38.315 --> 35:40.442
The guy must have grabbed her.

35:40.617 --> 35:42.016
I'm gonna check the back.

35:42.186 --> 35:44.586
- Deputy, where's your partner tonight?
- Gary?

35:44.755 --> 35:47.849
He's working a second job at the carnival.
He's a security guard.

35:48.025 --> 35:49.925
You saw stuffed animals and train tracks.

35:50.094 --> 35:53.291
The carnival's closed this time of year.
It's perfect to hide someone.

36:05.776 --> 36:07.334
Hello?

36:10.381 --> 36:12.315
Hello?

36:14.985 --> 36:16.247
Help!

36:16.920 --> 36:19.946
Somebody please help me!

36:21.392 --> 36:23.326
No one can hear you.

36:24.762 --> 36:28.198
- How did you see through my eyes?
- I don't know.

36:38.842 --> 36:40.275
Deputy Watts.

36:40.878 --> 36:42.641
Why are you doing this?

36:42.813 --> 36:49.218
I never wanted to hurt Chloe. I didn't even
want money. I wanted to rescue her.

36:49.386 --> 36:52.287
You kidnapped Chloe so you could
take credit for finding her?

36:52.456 --> 36:53.718
I could have been good!

36:54.191 --> 36:57.217
The best cop this town's ever seen!

36:57.394 --> 37:01.228
This case would've made my career!

37:08.505 --> 37:12.066
But it doesn't matter now.
I can still be the hero.

37:12.242 --> 37:14.540
What are you going to do?

37:16.980 --> 37:19.073
Solve your murder.

37:20.784 --> 37:23.685
No, please, please don't do this.

37:41.438 --> 37:42.700
Lana.

38:13.570 --> 38:18.337
- Lana, you all right?
- Clark, it's Watts, Deputy Watts.

38:18.509 --> 38:20.739
Okay, stay here.

38:31.822 --> 38:34.188
It's over, Watts.

38:39.830 --> 38:41.422
What the hell are you?

39:01.785 --> 39:03.047
Lana!

39:03.220 --> 39:04.847
Gary, drop the gun!

39:43.794 --> 39:46.058
Your mom told me you'd be out here.

39:48.865 --> 39:51.129
I haven't seen that smile in a week.
What's up?

39:51.301 --> 39:52.666
Well, I've got good news.

39:52.836 --> 39:55.304
<i>The Daily Planet called,
and I got an internship.</i>

39:55.472 --> 39:57.201
- That's great!
- Yeah!

39:57.374 --> 39:59.433
- You didn't even interview.
- I know. Well...

39:59.610 --> 40:03.774
<i>...they read my article in the Ledger on the
cop, and I guess my work spoke for itself.</i>

40:04.381 --> 40:07.145
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

40:07.317 --> 40:09.581
So I guess you'll spend the summer
in Metropolis.

40:09.753 --> 40:11.152
Yeah.

40:12.823 --> 40:14.814
- Will you come visit me?
- Yeah, of course!

40:14.992 --> 40:18.723
I would never pass up an opportunity
to see you in your natural habitat.

40:24.368 --> 40:29.203
Well, I just wanted you to be the first
to know, so I'll see you. Bye.

40:30.474 --> 40:31.964
Chloe.

40:35.279 --> 40:37.804
I was- Do you have plans
for the spring formal?

40:41.351 --> 40:43.819
Not at the moment.

40:45.155 --> 40:47.453
I was hoping...

40:48.959 --> 40:50.984
I was hoping you'd go with me.

40:52.562 --> 40:54.530
As my date.

41:01.405 --> 41:02.736
I would love to, Clark.

41:07.077 --> 41:09.511
Now I'm gonna go before my
good karma runs out.

41:11.715 --> 41:13.478
Chloe...

41:14.351 --> 41:16.319
...I'm sorry I didn't ask you sooner.

41:16.720 --> 41:19.655
It's okay. It was worth the wait.

41:36.373 --> 41:40.707
Lex, where's that crop-duster of yours?
I wanted to talk to him.

41:40.877 --> 41:43.846
- He seems to have disappeared.
- Maybe your visit scared him.

41:44.014 --> 41:45.276
Something or someone did.

41:45.449 --> 41:47.679
- What do you have for me?
- Preliminary results...

41:47.851 --> 41:49.250
...of the fragment we recovered.

41:49.886 --> 41:51.979
So, what is it?

41:52.155 --> 41:55.318
Well, all I can tell you...

41:56.727 --> 41:58.354
...is what it is not.

41:58.528 --> 42:00.120
I don't like riddles, doctor.

42:00.297 --> 42:03.266
Then this object will make you
profoundly unhappy.

42:03.433 --> 42:05.560
To be honest, Lex...

42:05.736 --> 42:07.636
...there is nothing...

42:07.804 --> 42:09.795
...like this alloy...

42:09.973 --> 42:11.270
...on this Earth.
