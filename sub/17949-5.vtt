09:26.033 --> 09:27.935
TO GET RID OF GRIFFIN'S
MARKETING TEAM

09:27.935 --> 09:29.937
SO THAT WE CAN TAKE OVER
THAT PITCH MEETING

09:29.937 --> 09:31.639
WITH SAM SELMART.

09:31.639 --> 09:35.175
[together] ON IT!

09:35.175 --> 09:36.744
- NO TREE HATS!

09:36.744 --> 09:40.280
- UM, TREE HATS HAVE SOLVED
A LOT OF PROBLEMS.

09:40.280 --> 09:41.749
- AND THEY'RE AWESOME.

09:41.749 --> 09:43.050
- YEAH, DO YOU HAVE
A BETTER IDEA?

09:43.050 --> 09:44.051
- HUH?

09:44.051 --> 09:45.185
- WELL, UH, THERE'S...

09:45.185 --> 09:47.855
[mumbles]

09:47.855 --> 09:50.223
- HELLO,
GRIFFIN'S MARKETING TEAM?

09:50.223 --> 09:52.660
YES, THIS IS SELMART WEST COAST
HEADQUARTERS.

09:52.660 --> 09:53.894
WE'RE GONNA NEED TO CANCEL

09:53.894 --> 09:55.896
THAT MERCHANDISING MEETING
THAT YOU HAD TODAY.

09:55.896 --> 09:58.932
MR. SELMART'S FEELING ILL.

09:58.932 --> 10:00.734
[together] NICE!

10:00.734 --> 10:02.235

10:02.235 --> 10:03.637
- OH, YEAH.

10:09.743 --> 10:12.479
- WHO IN THE NAME
OF CANDIED YAMS ARE YOU?

10:12.479 --> 10:14.648

OF KENDALL, JAMES, CARLOS,
LOGAN, GUSTAVO, AND KELLY.

10:18.952 --> 10:20.220
- DO ME THE NAMES.

10:20.220 --> 10:22.122
I'M GONNA CALL Y'ALL "CLEM."

10:22.122 --> 10:23.323
WHAT YOU GOT, CLEM?

10:23.323 --> 10:25.525
- SIR, I'M SURE YOU'LL AGREE,

10:25.525 --> 10:27.527
THE ITEMS UNDER THIS FANCY,
SHINY--

10:27.527 --> 10:28.896
- STOP RIGHT THERE, BIG CLEM.

10:28.896 --> 10:30.063
YOU SEE THEM BOXES BEHIND YOU?

10:30.063 --> 10:31.264
THEY ARE EMPTY.

10:31.264 --> 10:32.700
I WANT TO FILL 'EM
WITH MERCHANDISE,

10:32.700 --> 10:34.401
GET 'EM TO MY STORES,
AND MAKE ME SOME MONEY.

10:34.401 --> 10:36.770
NOW, QUIT TICKLING
MY SIDE PARTS AND PITCH ME.

10:36.770 --> 10:37.938
- RIGHT!

10:37.938 --> 10:39.807
THE FIRST ITEM
YOU'RE GOING TO SEE

10:39.807 --> 10:41.308
IS A CLASSIC.

10:41.308 --> 10:44.277
THE BIG TIME ACTION SET.

10:44.277 --> 10:46.613
- WHICH INCLUDES
SOME OF YOUR FAVORITE

10:46.613 --> 10:48.548
BIG TIME CATCHPHRASES.

10:48.548 --> 10:50.417

10:50.417 --> 10:51.418
- YOU'RE STUPID!

10:51.418 --> 10:52.986
- THEM DOLLS JUST SASS ME?

10:52.986 --> 10:54.154
- UH, NO, NO, NO.

10:54.154 --> 10:56.156
WH-WHAT THE DOLL WAS SUPPOSED
TO SAY IS--

10:56.156 --> 10:58.892
- SHUT IT!
SHUT IT FOREVER!

10:58.892 --> 11:02.629
- AND, NOW,
HERE IS JAMES AND LOGAN

11:02.629 --> 11:05.866
TO SHOW YOU THE NEXT PRODUCT
YOU ARE SURE TO LOVE!

11:05.866 --> 11:08.401
- WE WOULD LIKE YOU TO BE
THE FIRST TO EXPERIENCE

11:08.401 --> 11:10.237
BTR'S NEW FRAGRANCE...

11:10.237 --> 11:12.740
- A SPICY, CONTEMPORARY SCENT

11:12.740 --> 11:17.277
THAT SAYS
YOU WANT TO LIVE IT BIG-TIME.

11:17.277 --> 11:20.013
SMELLEVATE.

11:20.013 --> 11:22.382
- AH!
OH, MY SEEIN' EYES!

11:22.382 --> 11:23.650
OH, I'M TEMPORARILY BLIND!

11:23.650 --> 11:24.651
OH, IT BURNS!

11:24.651 --> 11:26.353
both: WHAT DID YOU PUT IN THERE?

11:26.353 --> 11:27.921
- LOGAN SAID TO MAKE IT SPICY.

11:27.921 --> 11:30.623
- I SAID TO ADD SPICE,
LIKE CINNAMON OR NUTMEG!

11:30.623 --> 11:31.792
- [screaming]
IT BURNS!

11:31.792 --> 11:34.795
- SO NO TO THE HABAÑERO
HOT SAUCE?

11:34.795 --> 11:36.930
- * AH, AH, AH-AH, OH

11:36.930 --> 11:38.832
- SORRY!
- WALK IT OFF!

11:43.570 --> 11:45.138
- AND IN OUR BIG STORY TODAY,

11:45.138 --> 11:47.607
MEGA RETAILER SAM SELMART
WAS INJURED

11:47.607 --> 11:50.077
IN A MERCHANDISE MEETING
GONE HORRIBLY AWRY.

11:50.077 --> 11:52.780
WHILE BEING AIRLIFTED
TO THE HOSPITAL, SELMART SAID,

11:52.780 --> 11:55.682
"A BLIND SALESMAN IS LIKE
A DONKEY WITH A HANGNAIL.

11:55.682 --> 12:00.453
YOU CAN LEAD HIM TO THE BARN,
BUT HE'LL STILL CALL YOU SUSAN."

12:00.453 --> 12:03.523
- GRIFFIN,
BEFORE YOU SAY ANYTHING...

12:03.523 --> 12:05.125
WE CAN FIX THIS.

12:05.125 --> 12:06.126
- LET ME GUESS.

12:06.126 --> 12:07.394
IT INVOLVES A CRANK PHONE CALL,

12:07.394 --> 12:08.528
BREAKING AND ENTERING,

12:08.528 --> 12:10.130
AND TREE HATS.

12:10.130 --> 12:13.801
- WE WEREN'T ACTUALLY
GONNA BREAK ANYTHING.

12:13.801 --> 12:15.335
- [laughs]

12:15.335 --> 12:17.905
- TREE HATS DON'T WORK IN THE
HIGH STAKES BUSINESS WORLD.

12:17.905 --> 12:20.140
WHAT MIGHT WORK
IS THE PERSONAL APOLOGY

12:20.140 --> 12:22.475
YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE
SAM SELMART TODAY.

12:24.711 --> 12:26.914
- [high-pitched voice]
YEAH, GUYS, LET'S GO APOLOGIZE.

12:26.914 --> 12:29.716
WE SHOULD GO SAY SORRY TO SAM!

12:29.716 --> 12:33.053
OKAY, YEAH, MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST
STOP TALKING, BECAUSE...

12:33.053 --> 12:34.822
- AND AFTER YOU APOLOGIZE,

12:34.822 --> 12:37.257
I'LL BE THERE TO
PERSONALLY PITCH THE PRODUCTS

12:37.257 --> 12:39.993
SAM WAS SUPPOSED TO SEE
YESTERDAY AT 5:00.

12:39.993 --> 12:42.129
THE TOILET BRUSHES,
THE HORSE SHAMPOO,

12:42.129 --> 12:44.364
AND THE DOLLS THAT DO NOT
TELL SELMART

12:44.364 --> 12:47.434
TO "SHUT IT, SHUT IT FOREVER."

12:47.434 --> 12:50.270
- GRIFFIN, IF PEOPLE SEE THESE
PRODUCTS, THEY'LL LAUGH AT US.

12:50.270 --> 12:52.139
- I HATE WHEN PEOPLE
LAUGH AT ME...

12:52.139 --> 12:53.841
THAT ONE TIME AT SUMMER CAMP
WHEN THOSE GUYS

12:53.841 --> 12:55.876
PUT A SIGN ON MY BACK THAT SAID,
"FART ON ME."

12:55.876 --> 12:58.711
[together]
WE SAID WE WERE SORRY.

12:58.711 --> 13:01.281
- AND NOW YOU'RE GOING TO SAY
YOU'RE SORRY TO SAM SELMART.

13:01.281 --> 13:03.150
AND PITCH THESE PRODUCTS.

13:03.150 --> 13:06.086
WHAT DO YOUR DOLLS HAVE TO SAY
NOW?

13:06.086 --> 13:08.321
- LET'S GO TELL SAM WE'RE SORRY!

13:08.321 --> 13:09.489
- WHATEVER GRIFFIN SAYS.

13:09.489 --> 13:10.924
- YEAH, GREAT PLAN, BOSS!

13:10.924 --> 13:13.360
- AWAY WE GO!

13:14.862 --> 13:17.030
[all chanting]
- BREAK IT, BREAK IT.

13:17.030 --> 13:18.866
[door slams]

13:18.866 --> 13:21.401
- I SAID NO KARATE IN THE LOBBY.

13:21.401 --> 13:24.271
[kids yell]

13:25.772 --> 13:26.974
[sighs]
HOW CAN I--

13:26.974 --> 13:28.241
- I WANT MY BELT.

13:28.241 --> 13:29.409
I BOUGHT A ROBE.

13:29.409 --> 13:30.410
ROBES COME WITH BELTS.

13:30.410 --> 13:31.711
I WANT MY BELT.

13:31.711 --> 13:33.713
SO JUST REACH DOWN THERE,

13:33.713 --> 13:37.484
OPEN UP ANOTHER ROBE,
AND GIVE ME THE BELT.

13:37.484 --> 13:40.153
- IF I DID THAT, THEN I'D HAVE
A ROBE WITHOUT A BELT,

13:40.153 --> 13:43.556
WHICH I CAN'T SELL,
AND I'D BE OUT $45.

13:43.556 --> 13:47.895
AND PERSONALLY,
I'D PREFER IF YOU WERE OUT $45.

13:47.895 --> 13:49.429
- HAVEN'T YOU EVER HEARD
THE EXPRESSION

13:49.429 --> 13:50.730
"THE CUSTOMER'S ALWAYS RIGHT"?

13:50.730 --> 13:53.133
- I DON'T LISTEN TO HIP-HOP.

13:53.133 --> 13:55.502
IF YOU'VE GOT A PROBLEM,
CALL CUSTOMER SERVICE.

13:55.502 --> 13:56.503
- DON'T...

13:56.503 --> 13:59.907
MOVE.

13:59.907 --> 14:02.142
[telephone ringing]

14:02.142 --> 14:04.011
PICK UP THE PHONE.

14:06.046 --> 14:07.514
PICK UP THE PHONE.

14:07.514 --> 14:09.016
[machine beeps]

14:09.016 --> 14:11.418
- YOU'VE REACHED THE PALMWOODS
STORE CUSTOMER SERVICE LINE.

14:11.418 --> 14:12.986
WE'RE EXPERIENCING
HIGH CALL VOLUME.

14:12.986 --> 14:17.257
YOUR CURRENT WAIT TIME IS
LONG.

14:17.257 --> 14:20.627
* BA, BA-DA, BA, BA,
BA-DA-DA-DA *

14:24.932 --> 14:27.300
- HOWDY, ARTHUR.
- SAM.

14:27.300 --> 14:30.370
- HEY, BOYS.
BLIND ANYONE LATELY?

14:30.370 --> 14:33.040
- WE ARE SO SORRY.
- SO SORRY!

14:33.040 --> 14:34.507
- "SORRY" DOESN'T TRIM
THE WHISKERS

14:34.507 --> 14:36.109
ON THE ADMIRAL'S BEARD, DOES IT?

14:36.109 --> 14:38.946
BUT I WILL FORGIVE YOU
IF YOU PITCH ME SOME MERCHANDISE

14:38.946 --> 14:40.713
I CAN SELL IN MY STORES
AND MAKE MONEY WITH.

14:40.713 --> 14:42.715
- SAM, MY RESEARCH
AND DEVELOPMENT TEAM

14:42.715 --> 14:44.952
AT RCM/CBT GLOBALNET/SANYOID

14:44.952 --> 14:47.020
HAS SOME EXCITING BIG TIME
MERCHANDISE.

14:47.020 --> 14:48.655
IT'S GONNA FLY OFF YOUR SHELVES!

14:48.655 --> 14:50.323
- WELL, I SURE HOPE
THEY'RE BETTER PRODUCTS

14:50.323 --> 14:52.192
THAN THAT LAST JACKALOPE DONE
TRIED TO PITCH ME.

14:52.192 --> 14:54.027
KATY PERRY HORSE SHAMPOO
AND TOILET SCRUBBERS

14:54.027 --> 14:55.462
WITH ONE DIRECTION'S FACE
ON THEM.

14:55.462 --> 14:58.598
WHY IN THE WORLD WOULD I WANT
TO SCRUB MY JOHN WITH LIAM?

15:00.533 --> 15:02.769
- WHICH IS WHY
YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE

15:02.769 --> 15:08.108
THE ALL NEW AND IMPROVED
BIG TIME RUSH ACTION SET.

15:08.108 --> 15:09.309
- OOH.

15:09.309 --> 15:11.711
- I MADE BOOM-BOOM.
BETTER CHANGE ME!

15:11.711 --> 15:12.879
[nervous laughter]

15:12.879 --> 15:14.047
- BOOM-BOOM?

15:14.047 --> 15:16.049
THAT AIN'T THE KIND OF ACTION
I WANT.

15:16.049 --> 15:19.719
I WANT KUNG FU GRIP
AND SUPERPOWER.

15:19.719 --> 15:24.857
- OH, OH, OH, THESE DOLLS,
THEY FIGHT ZOMBIE ROBOTS.

15:24.857 --> 15:27.360
- YEAH, YEAH, AND THEY GO,
"PEW, PEW!"

15:27.360 --> 15:28.361
- PEW, PEW?

15:28.361 --> 15:29.696
NOW, I LIKE ME SOME PEW, PEW.

15:29.696 --> 15:30.863
WHAT ELSE THEY DO?

15:30.863 --> 15:32.899
- UH...THEY FLY!
- DARN TOOTIN' THEY FLY.

15:32.899 --> 15:35.802
[all speaking at once]

15:35.802 --> 15:37.104
- I LOVE ME SOME FLYIN'!

15:37.104 --> 15:38.271
HOW DO THEY FLY?

15:38.271 --> 15:41.574

15:41.574 --> 15:43.076
beep!

15:43.076 --> 15:44.577

15:44.577 --> 15:45.778
crash!

15:48.481 --> 15:52.019
- [high-pitched voice]
WELL, HE SAID HE LOVED FLYING.

15:52.019 --> 15:54.287
- NO REFUNDS AND NO RETURNS?

15:54.287 --> 15:56.123
NO WAY.

15:58.791 --> 16:01.028
- I SAID NO KARATE IN THE LOBBY!

16:01.028 --> 16:02.895
- IF HE DOESN'T WANT TO GIVE ME
THE BELT,

16:02.895 --> 16:04.831
I'LL JUST TAKE IT MYSELF.

16:04.831 --> 16:09.502
[punchy music]

16:09.502 --> 16:11.571
BINGO.

16:11.571 --> 16:13.406
- WELCOME TO
THE PALMWOODS STORE.

16:13.406 --> 16:17.844
ONE ROBE WILL BE $45.

16:17.844 --> 16:20.247
- I DON'T HAVE $45.

16:20.247 --> 16:22.415
- WELL, THEN YOU DON'T HAVE
A ROBE.

16:22.415 --> 16:25.185
- I WILL HAUNT YOU
UNTIL I GET MY BELT.

16:25.185 --> 16:27.854
FROM THE MOMENT YOU OPEN
THIS STUPID PALMWOODS STORE

16:27.854 --> 16:29.189
UNTIL THE MINUTE YOU CLOSE,

16:29.189 --> 16:30.357

I GAVE YOU $45,

16:32.525 --> 16:34.627
AND I WILL GET MY MONEY'S WORTH.

16:34.627 --> 16:36.429
- I'M SO SCARED.

16:36.429 --> 16:38.098
[laughs]

16:42.535 --> 16:43.870
- HOW LONG HAS HE BEEN IN THERE?

16:43.870 --> 16:47.540
- ABOUT AN HOUR AND 23 MINUTES.

16:47.540 --> 16:50.210
I THINK HE'S ALMOST FINISHED,
THOUGH.

16:50.210 --> 16:51.744
- AND WE'RE FINISHED.

16:51.744 --> 16:53.280
BECAUSE SELMART STOPPED SELLING

16:53.280 --> 16:55.082
BIG TIME RUSH'S MUSIC
IN HIS STORES.

16:55.082 --> 16:58.785
- WHICH ACCOUNTS FOR 50%
OF OUR ALBUM SALES.

16:58.785 --> 17:00.620
- ACTUALLY, 72%.

17:00.620 --> 17:02.089
- [gasps]

17:02.089 --> 17:03.356
- IT'S OVER.

17:03.356 --> 17:05.192
I PITCHED
HORRIBLE PRODUCT IDEAS,

17:05.192 --> 17:08.095
LAUNCHED THE WORLD'S RICHEST CEO
OVER OUR HEADS,

17:08.095 --> 17:12.432
AND KILLED YOUR MUSIC CAREER
IN LESS THAN THREE MINUTES.

17:12.432 --> 17:14.834
- GRIFFIN, WE CAN FIX THIS.

17:14.834 --> 17:16.269
- HOW?

17:16.269 --> 17:18.405
WE'RE BANNED FROM SELMART'S
WEST COAST HEADQUARTERS

17:18.405 --> 17:19.872
AND BLOCKED
FROM ALL HIS PHONE LINES.

17:23.243 --> 17:26.246
[punchy spy music]

17:26.246 --> 17:29.316

17:29.316 --> 17:31.418
ARE YOU SURE THIS IS GONNA WORK?

17:31.418 --> 17:34.554
[together] DEFINITELY
PROBABLY NOT.

17:39.626 --> 17:42.562
[suspenseful music]

17:46.133 --> 17:49.035
- AH!

17:49.035 --> 17:52.372
[screams]

17:52.372 --> 17:55.542
[gasping]

17:55.542 --> 17:56.776
FINE.

17:56.776 --> 17:57.910
YOU WANT A BELT?

17:57.910 --> 18:00.580
I'LL GET YOU A BELT.

HERE'S YOUR BELT.

18:05.552 --> 18:07.554

FROM THE LOST AND FOUND.

18:07.554 --> 18:08.955
- NO, IT'S A BELT!

18:08.955 --> 18:11.258
AND IT'S NOT ONLY STYLISH.
IT'S FUNCTIONAL!

18:11.258 --> 18:13.260
AND IT'S STURDY

18:13.260 --> 18:18.265
AND CAN BE USED TO HOLD
YOUR ROBE TOGETHER.

18:18.265 --> 18:20.633
YOU THINK YOU COULD BEAT ME
IN A FIGHT?

18:20.633 --> 18:23.636
WELL, BRING IT ON!

18:23.636 --> 18:25.672
- YOU HEARD HIM, GUYS.

18:25.672 --> 18:27.840
KARATE IN THE LOBBY!

18:27.840 --> 18:28.975
[kids yell]

18:28.975 --> 18:32.011
- NO!
NO, NO, NO!

18:32.011 --> 18:34.447
[kids yelling]

18:34.447 --> 18:35.915
- THEY ALL DID GREAT TODAY.

18:35.915 --> 18:38.551
THEY ALL GOT PROMOTED
FROM THEIR WHITE BELTS.

18:38.551 --> 18:41.221
- CAN I HAVE ONE OF THOSE?
