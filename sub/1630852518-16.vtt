WEBVTT

00:30.989 --> 00:32.782
Dude, I really don't get
the appeal of this.

00:32.866 --> 00:34.492
It's a dog thing.

00:34.576 --> 00:36.327
Now throw it, human boy!

00:37.495 --> 00:39.164
Excuse me.

00:39.247 --> 00:42.751
Do you know which direction
the Porkbelly Convention Center is?

00:42.834 --> 00:45.754


00:46.796 --> 00:48.673
Thanks, human boy and dog!

00:48.757 --> 00:50.008


00:50.091 --> 00:52.051
OK, what was that?

00:52.135 --> 00:54.220
Oh, I'm part pointer. Watch.

00:54.304 --> 00:56.598
-Bathroom! Snacks!

00:56.681 --> 00:58.850
Enormous billboard for Johnny X Con!

00:59.934 --> 01:01.019


01:01.102 --> 01:02.562
"Johnny X Con"?

01:02.645 --> 01:05.065
"Featuring Johnny X live"?!

01:05.148 --> 01:06.816
But you're Johnny X.

01:06.900 --> 01:09.527
And I wasn't even invited to my own Con?

01:09.611 --> 01:12.363
-"Don't miss T-shirts,

01:12.447 --> 01:15.241
games, panel discussions, and autographs

01:15.325 --> 01:17.869
with Porkbelly's favorite superhero."

01:18.578 --> 01:23.625
<i>Come on down and get an autograph</i>
<i>from me, Johnny X!</i>

01:23.708 --> 01:27.754
OK, that looks like me,
but sounds nothing like me.

01:27.837 --> 01:31.883
Hey! Did you break into the lab
and take our Rocket Boots, Arm Blaster,

01:31.966 --> 01:33.384
and new Hypno-Goggles?

01:33.468 --> 01:36.638
OK, hold on!
What are Hypno-Goggles?

01:36.721 --> 01:39.808
Highly advanced eyewear
that produces a hypnotic beam

01:39.891 --> 01:42.685
to get people to do
virtually anything you want.

01:42.769 --> 01:45.230
Nice, and yeah, I took all of it.

01:45.313 --> 01:46.648
I buried them in the backyard

01:46.731 --> 01:48.817
and then made a map
that shows you where they are.

01:48.900 --> 01:51.653
Johnny… we don't have time for this!

01:52.737 --> 01:54.989
The map does look like fun.

01:55.073 --> 01:56.282
I know!

01:57.033 --> 01:59.911
And they'd better be there, Johnny!

01:59.994 --> 02:02.288
Um, you didn't steal anything
from the lab,

02:02.372 --> 02:04.874
and that's the map
to all your parents' stuff you broke

02:04.958 --> 02:06.543
but said you knew nothing about.

02:06.626 --> 02:09.087
But it will buy us some time
so we can break into the lab,

02:09.170 --> 02:12.090
grab our super suits,
and get to that convention.

02:13.925 --> 02:15.760
Yep, he tricked us.

02:15.844 --> 02:20.014
-Johnny X and Super Pooch, away!

02:24.686 --> 02:26.187
Good day, fine citizens.

02:26.271 --> 02:28.398
I'm Johnny X, and this is--

02:28.481 --> 02:30.150
Where's your pass?

02:30.233 --> 02:32.652
I don't need a pass. I'm Johnny X!

02:32.735 --> 02:34.487
Ha! Yeah, right--

02:34.571 --> 02:35.697
Bro, but look!

02:35.780 --> 02:37.907
A Super Pooch!

02:37.991 --> 02:40.535
I can't believe
no one's dressed up as him.

02:40.618 --> 02:44.706
Well, I do think Super Pooch
is under-appreciated sometimes.

02:44.789 --> 02:47.917
Then this one's on us, Super Pooch.

02:50.962 --> 02:52.797
But not you.

02:52.881 --> 02:56.384
What? Look, I'm the real Johnny X,

02:56.467 --> 02:59.804
and I'm here to stop
whoever that imposter is!

02:59.888 --> 03:02.015
If you were the real Johnny X,

03:02.098 --> 03:04.642
you could just throw us
over your head and walk in.

03:05.268 --> 03:06.561
How did I not think of that?

03:07.312 --> 03:08.938
Aah!

03:09.731 --> 03:11.983
OK, where's that dog and--

03:12.066 --> 03:14.152
Mr. Black and Mr. White?

03:14.944 --> 03:16.154
Johnny! Shh!

03:16.237 --> 03:19.240
We're super secret undercover
dressed as you.

03:19.324 --> 03:20.742
Here's the skinny.

03:20.825 --> 03:25.580
We got a tip that a crazy fan
is threatening to destroy Johnny X Con

03:25.663 --> 03:28.458
if he doesn't get
Johnny X's autograph today.

03:28.541 --> 03:30.919
Have you heard
or seen anything that seems…

03:31.002 --> 03:32.587
odd?

03:33.880 --> 03:35.256
Yes.

03:35.340 --> 03:38.509
But I'm here to stop the imposter
who stole my X identity,

03:38.593 --> 03:40.094
and I will find him.

03:40.178 --> 03:44.140
Ooh, that's gonna be tough,
cos we're all dressed the same.

03:47.602 --> 03:48.561
Wait a minute.

03:48.645 --> 03:52.649
How do we know you're the real Johnny X
and not imposter Johnny X,

03:52.732 --> 03:54.609
or the crazy fan?

03:54.692 --> 03:56.611
Or both!

03:56.694 --> 04:01.074
I'm gonna leave now,
cos everyone here is crazy!

04:01.157 --> 04:02.575
Did you see that face?

04:02.659 --> 04:04.577
It must be the crazy fan.

04:04.661 --> 04:06.329
-Get him!
-Uh-oh.

04:09.958 --> 04:11.876
Ooh, that looked like it hurt.

04:15.088 --> 04:18.383
But bad news, the Johnny X imposter
is still on the loose!

04:18.466 --> 04:21.427
And we'll nab him
at the panel discussion in an hour.

04:21.511 --> 04:23.972
Am I a Super Pooch or what?

04:25.848 --> 04:27.392
-There he is!
-It's him!

04:27.475 --> 04:29.352
Hey, X fans!

04:29.435 --> 04:30.311
What's up?

04:30.395 --> 04:32.480
It's me! Cos I'm Johnny X!

04:33.690 --> 04:37.819
He's also right there,
and if he's fake, he's a really good fake.

04:37.902 --> 04:39.946
OK, one, he sounds nothing like me.

04:40.029 --> 04:40.989
Two?

04:41.072 --> 04:43.157
Away, Super Pooch!

04:43.241 --> 04:47.245
Welcome to the first-ever
Johnny X Convention!

04:47.328 --> 04:49.956
With me! Cos I'm Johnny X!

04:50.039 --> 04:52.375
Only you're not the real Johnny X.

04:52.458 --> 04:54.002
-I am!

04:54.085 --> 04:55.336
Ooh…

04:55.420 --> 04:57.005
But which is the real one?

04:59.048 --> 05:00.258
Whoa!

05:00.341 --> 05:01.676
That's the real one.

05:03.219 --> 05:04.637
Well, well.

05:04.721 --> 05:08.725
I knew if I threw this convention,
you would show up.

05:08.808 --> 05:10.810
Who are you?

05:10.893 --> 05:14.272
Don't you recognize me?

05:14.355 --> 05:16.774
I'm your number-one fan!

05:17.400 --> 05:19.861
-Jeffy?
-Oh, no.

05:20.945 --> 05:22.363
<i>Who's the kid?</i>

05:22.447 --> 05:25.366
I'm Jeffy!
Johnny's number-one fan!

05:30.330 --> 05:33.416
From now on,
I'm gonna be just like you…

05:33.499 --> 05:35.501
Johnny X.

05:44.177 --> 05:45.636
Wow…

05:45.720 --> 05:47.805
Can you autograph my shirt?

05:50.349 --> 05:53.061
Sorry, Jeffy.
I'll have to give it to you later.

05:53.144 --> 05:54.520
Aw…

05:54.771 --> 05:58.024
I waited, and waited,

05:58.107 --> 06:00.610
but you never gave it to me later!

06:00.693 --> 06:03.196
Then I got smarter,
went through a growth spurt,

06:03.279 --> 06:05.823
and plotted my revenge!

06:05.907 --> 06:08.409
Uh, did you ever think
that I didn't give you an autograph

06:08.493 --> 06:11.079
because I didn't have a pen?

06:11.162 --> 06:13.873
He never has them.
Not even at school.

06:13.956 --> 06:16.751
Oh. Well… too late!

06:16.834 --> 06:19.045
Because I'm Johnny X now,

06:19.128 --> 06:21.839
and I always carry a pen!

06:21.923 --> 06:27.303
You can't be Johnny X, dude,
because you don't have a Super Pooch!

06:27.386 --> 06:29.430
But I do have…

06:29.514 --> 06:31.682
Hypno-Goggles!

06:31.766 --> 06:33.309
Wait, how did he get the--

06:36.187 --> 06:40.608
You are<i> my</i> loyal sidekick now!

06:40.691 --> 06:43.319
I'm so your sidekick.

06:43.402 --> 06:44.904
Heh-heh-heh.

06:44.987 --> 06:48.199
So it was you
who stole my sisters' tech.

06:48.282 --> 06:51.619
And once I had the Rocket Boots
and Hand Blaster,

06:51.702 --> 06:53.955
I just needed to learn…

06:54.038 --> 06:58.292
…to perfectly
impersonate your voice.

06:58.376 --> 07:00.169
Yeah, that sounds nothing like me.

07:00.253 --> 07:03.714
And now that I finally have
Super Pooch by my side,

07:03.798 --> 07:06.092
I'm the real Johnny X!

07:06.175 --> 07:09.011
Super Pooch, Power Bark!

07:09.095 --> 07:10.513


07:13.850 --> 07:18.187
There! We've officially replaced
the stolen pair of Hypno-Goggles.

07:19.564 --> 07:21.315
-Johnny!

07:21.399 --> 07:24.485
First you steal our stuff,
then you lie to us…

07:24.569 --> 07:27.071
Now you've destroyed our new goggles!

07:27.155 --> 07:29.532
It was my crazy fan Jeffy
that stole it all.

07:29.615 --> 07:31.826
He wanted a Johnny X autograph,
but I didn't have a pen

07:31.909 --> 07:33.578
cos I never have pens.

07:33.661 --> 07:35.997
Then he had a growth spurt
and totally lost it,

07:36.080 --> 07:38.291
and now he wants to take over my life!

07:38.374 --> 07:40.835
Hmm… he seems believable.

07:42.628 --> 07:45.006
He stole your Rocket Boots,
then he used your Hypno-Goggles

07:45.089 --> 07:46.549
to steal my Super Pooch.

07:46.632 --> 07:48.134
You gotta help me!

07:48.217 --> 07:49.510
Well…

07:49.594 --> 07:51.220
the treasure map was fun.

07:51.304 --> 07:54.140
And we have almost killed him 42 times.

07:54.223 --> 07:55.808
So…

07:55.892 --> 07:59.729
let's take that stealing
and phony superhero down!

07:59.812 --> 08:02.398
Great, now I just need
a total Super Suit upgrade

08:02.482 --> 08:06.068
with Rocket Boots and an Arm Blaster
that's way better than Jeffy's.

08:08.196 --> 08:11.073
<i>Welcome to the Johnny X Con</i>
<i>discussion panel,</i>

08:11.157 --> 08:14.076
<i>and now, let's give it up for…</i>

08:14.160 --> 08:15.828
<i>Johnny X!</i>

08:15.912 --> 08:18.122
-It is I, Johnny X,

08:18.206 --> 08:20.958
ready to save Porkbelly
in a moment's notice.

08:21.042 --> 08:24.337
Now, who wants an autograph?

08:24.420 --> 08:26.589
Cos I always have a pen!

08:27.673 --> 08:29.592
But if you want
the real Johnny X's autograph,

08:29.675 --> 08:32.178
you're gonna want it from me!

08:32.261 --> 08:34.055
And that's my dog.

08:39.143 --> 08:43.981
Super Pooch, destroy him
with another Power Bark!

08:44.065 --> 08:46.359
Yes, Johnny X.

08:47.777 --> 08:50.571
Don't you mean no, Super Pooch?

08:50.655 --> 08:53.699
Yes… I mean… no.

08:54.492 --> 08:57.245
No, you mean yes!

08:57.328 --> 08:58.829
Yes.

08:58.913 --> 09:00.248
No!

09:00.331 --> 09:01.958
Yes!

09:03.417 --> 09:04.794
I mean, yes-no.

09:04.877 --> 09:07.547
I mean… me feel loopy…

09:12.718 --> 09:15.304
I'm the real Johnny X!

09:18.099 --> 09:20.434
Gentlemen, arrest that fake!

09:20.518 --> 09:25.147
He's clearly the crazed fan
who wants my autograph.

09:25.231 --> 09:28.401
No, I'm Johnny X, and he's the fake!

09:28.484 --> 09:30.236
Ooh!

09:30.319 --> 09:33.114
Well, there's two Johnny X's, but…

09:33.197 --> 09:36.409
Only one Super Pooch here.

09:37.118 --> 09:41.789
And only a hero's best friend
would know who's the real Johnny X.

09:41.872 --> 09:45.001
Super Pooch, it's me, Johnny X!

09:45.084 --> 09:48.296
No, Super Pooch, I'm Johnny X!

09:48.379 --> 09:49.630
Hmm…

09:49.714 --> 09:52.008
What's my favorite food?

09:52.091 --> 09:53.467
Meat!

09:53.551 --> 09:55.344
I do love meat.

09:56.762 --> 09:59.515
Every dog loves meat.
And he sounds nothing like me!

09:59.599 --> 10:02.476
What are my two favorite colors?

10:02.560 --> 10:03.978
Black and white.

10:04.061 --> 10:05.605
Correct again.

10:05.688 --> 10:07.690
-Ooh!
-Cos dogs are color blind,

10:07.773 --> 10:10.151
and could fake Johnny X,
who sounds nothing like me,

10:10.234 --> 10:11.694
do this?

10:15.573 --> 10:17.908
That's the real one.

10:17.992 --> 10:19.243
Ooh…!

10:19.327 --> 10:20.995
No, wait! I can…

10:21.078 --> 10:22.663
I mean…

10:22.747 --> 10:25.082
I can do that! Look!

10:34.800 --> 10:36.802
OK, I can't. But…

10:36.886 --> 10:39.096
he doesn't give autographs!

10:39.180 --> 10:42.433
And now I'll destroy Johnny X Con,

10:42.516 --> 10:45.102
and nothing you can do can stop--

10:46.395 --> 10:49.690
My Arm Blaster has a Super Suction Mode.

10:49.774 --> 10:50.941
Nice.

10:52.610 --> 10:54.612
OK, let's go call your mom.

10:54.695 --> 10:58.658
Oh, do we have to call my mom?
No one really got hurt…

10:58.741 --> 11:03.579
Now, does anyone want an autograph
from the real Johnny X?

11:03.663 --> 11:05.164
-Me! Me!

11:06.540 --> 11:08.459
And does anyone have a pen?
