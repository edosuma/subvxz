01:16.480 --> 01:18.516
Good evening, family.

01:18.720 --> 01:23.271
And welcome to the first annual
Bundy-financial-crisis summit meeting.

01:27.200 --> 01:29.270
Hello, Shop at Home network?

01:29.480 --> 01:33.029
Yes, I'd like to order
your Brazilian amethyst dinner ring.

01:33.240 --> 01:36.312
And can I get a dinner
to go with that?

01:37.320 --> 01:39.629
While I have your attention...

01:39.840 --> 01:42.991
...let's go over
some of last month's bills.

01:46.920 --> 01:50.754
I'm sure we'll find a little fat
here in our budget.

01:51.600 --> 01:55.388
"Renewal notice for Big 'Uns."

02:01.440 --> 02:02.953
Let's try another one here.

02:04.320 --> 02:06.914
"The Larry Storch School of Acting."

02:07.160 --> 02:11.038
Al, becoming an actress
is very important to Kelly...

02:11.240 --> 02:15.153
...and you will not break her heart
by telling her she can't do it.

02:15.400 --> 02:18.870
All right, Peg. In that case,
you get a job to help pay for it.

02:19.720 --> 02:21.711
Poor Kelly.

02:23.080 --> 02:27.153
By the way, you could do your part by
cutting down on this shopping network.

02:27.400 --> 02:29.595
Hey, I don't shop that much.

02:30.520 --> 02:33.512
Hey, Mom, the stuff
you ordered is here.

02:34.440 --> 02:37.000
Oh, goody!

02:38.760 --> 02:40.990
Hey, Dad, guess what happened.

02:41.200 --> 02:43.634
I am up for a role in a sitcom.

02:43.880 --> 02:45.154
It's called Pease in a Pod.

02:45.360 --> 02:47.237
It's about this family
named the Peases...

02:47.440 --> 02:49.670
...and they live in this house,
and their lives...

02:49.880 --> 02:53.429
...and what goes on in their house
and their lives.

02:55.560 --> 02:57.118
Fox?

03:00.760 --> 03:03.069
Yeah, how'd you know?

03:03.320 --> 03:04.355
Oh, joy!

03:04.560 --> 03:08.314
My Boxcar Willie tapes are here.

03:09.240 --> 03:11.356
And my tiara.

03:11.560 --> 03:16.395
I tell you, it is just like Christmas,
except with presents.

03:17.080 --> 03:20.117
- What else you got in...?
- This is Mommy's stuff. Get out of here.

03:20.800 --> 03:23.598
Anyway, I'm up for the role
of the daughter.

03:23.800 --> 03:25.392
How's this for cosmic irony?

03:25.600 --> 03:28.160
In real life, I actually am one.

03:28.360 --> 03:30.191
What are the odds?

03:32.760 --> 03:35.638
- Indeed, but, pumpkin...
- Daddy, I have to get this part.

03:35.840 --> 03:38.354
I am perfect for it. Look.

03:39.800 --> 03:41.472
"Blond...

03:41.840 --> 03:43.068
...perky...

03:43.280 --> 03:45.111
...lit..."

03:48.000 --> 03:49.592
"Literate."

03:55.880 --> 04:01.079
Plus, add that to the skills
that I learned at Larry Storch's...

04:02.000 --> 04:03.353
...and I'm a shoo-in.

04:03.560 --> 04:06.597
Hey, Bud, tryouts are tomorrow.
Come help me rehearse my lines.

04:06.800 --> 04:08.631
What's in it for me?

04:08.840 --> 04:10.990
I'll let you touch a picture
of my friend Cindy.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.433
Where?

04:21.279 --> 04:24.955
Well, let's see. I have an unemployed
actress for a daughter...

04:25.840 --> 04:28.877
...a son who'd have sex
with a fire hydrant...

04:30.360 --> 04:32.157
Oh, happy day.

04:32.360 --> 04:37.150
My TV Guide-cover
collector plates are here.

04:38.120 --> 04:39.633
That.

04:41.360 --> 04:43.749
I wonder where the next
bolt of lightning will strike?

04:45.360 --> 04:47.351
I guess this isn't a good time
to tell him...

04:47.560 --> 04:50.950
...I haven't been comfortable
with my sexuality lately.

04:53.360 --> 04:55.271
"Snap, crackle, pop"?

04:55.480 --> 04:57.710
Mom, why do they always say that?

04:57.960 --> 04:59.313
I mean, the snap, okay...

04:59.520 --> 05:02.398
...and maybe the crackle,
but you never hear the pop.

05:02.600 --> 05:04.750
And what's the deal with Trix...?

05:04.960 --> 05:07.315
That'll be fine, Miss Bundy.

05:07.520 --> 05:08.475
Thank you.

05:08.720 --> 05:11.439
Well, you know, I can do the scene
a couple different ways.

05:11.680 --> 05:14.069
Can any of them be funny?

05:15.760 --> 05:18.194
Okay, Half Dome.

05:20.480 --> 05:22.596
We all know
I'm not gonna get this part...

05:22.800 --> 05:25.075
...but before I go,
I have to ask you one question.

05:26.200 --> 05:30.990
I swear, Miss Bundy, we would keep it
just as cold in here if you were a man.

05:31.760 --> 05:33.671
And wearing a bra.

05:34.880 --> 05:36.598
No, not that.

05:36.800 --> 05:39.598
I was just wondering,
when did television get so weird?

05:39.800 --> 05:42.234
I mean, nobody eats breakfast
at the table anymore.

05:42.440 --> 05:44.271
And cereal...? I mean, come on...

05:44.480 --> 05:47.950
...when I was growing up we were lucky
if we got toaster leavings.

05:48.880 --> 05:50.916
"Toaster leavings"?

05:51.160 --> 05:54.948
No, "leavings." The Q is silent.

05:58.920 --> 06:01.912
They're the crumbs that you find
at the bottom of a toaster.

06:02.120 --> 06:04.509
We were practically raised on them.

06:05.320 --> 06:08.437
"Toaster leavings..."

06:09.520 --> 06:11.431
I like it. Write that down.

06:11.640 --> 06:15.599
Come on, Ron. I'm a pro.
I'm not taking notes from some kid.

06:15.800 --> 06:18.917
Would you rather go back
to Full House?

06:21.200 --> 06:23.919
"Toaster leavings," you say?

06:24.400 --> 06:27.392
Tell us some more
about your family life, Miss Bundy.

06:27.640 --> 06:28.595
Okay.

06:28.800 --> 06:30.756
Well, first there's my father.

06:30.960 --> 06:32.552
Now, you know how
you have the dad...

06:32.760 --> 06:34.637
...and he's all happy
and glad to be home?

06:34.840 --> 06:38.230
Well, in my family,
it's not really the case.

07:22.160 --> 07:24.469
Well, then of course, there's me.

07:45.080 --> 07:49.596
And that's what it's like
to be a part of my family.

07:54.840 --> 07:58.992
Well, thank you, Miss Bundy.

07:59.200 --> 08:00.758
That was enlightening.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.560
So you mean I get to be
on Pease in a Pod?

08:04.080 --> 08:05.752
No, but...

08:05.960 --> 08:09.316
...I am casting for the lead
in The Mother Teresa Story.

08:09.520 --> 08:13.798
Would you mind disrobing
and saying, "Oh, the children"?

08:16.760 --> 08:17.715
Good evening, family.

08:19.080 --> 08:20.308
And welcome to the second...

08:20.520 --> 08:26.516
...first annual Bundy-financial-crisis
summit meeting.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.274
Hey, guys.

08:32.480 --> 08:33.629
Hey, Daddy...

08:33.840 --> 08:35.159
...guess what today is.

08:35.400 --> 08:38.597
The pathetic continuation
of yesterday?

08:38.840 --> 08:42.071
No. It's the premiere
of Pease in a Pod on Fox.

08:42.280 --> 08:46.193
Hey, let's turn it on. I gotta see
that bimbo they got to play my part.

08:46.400 --> 08:47.992
Fox network viewing positions.

09:04.120 --> 09:05.633
Peg...

09:05.840 --> 09:07.478
...hit the button.

09:07.680 --> 09:12.959
Tak e a mom and a dad
And two kids and a dog

09:13.840 --> 09:15.796
Put them all in a house
With a mouse

09:16.000 --> 09:18.878
You've got
Pease in a pod

09:19.120 --> 09:22.590
Pease, Pease, Pease
Pease in a pod

09:24.480 --> 09:27.631
Well, this certainly looks
like another winner.

09:29.760 --> 09:33.594
Wow, that room looks familiar.

09:34.320 --> 09:37.118
You know those sitcoms,
they all look alike.

09:37.320 --> 09:40.676
Will you look
at that God-awful couch.

09:41.360 --> 09:42.349
Hey, that's funny.

09:42.560 --> 09:46.189
In the scene that I read, it started
with everybody eating breakfast.

09:57.120 --> 09:58.712
Boy, does my life suck.

10:03.800 --> 10:06.360
Thank God, I got the house
to myself.

10:06.560 --> 10:08.152
Hey, Chuck.

10:10.240 --> 10:12.754
And they call me stupid.

10:14.320 --> 10:17.278
I just hope Patty
left some dinner for me.

10:17.920 --> 10:18.875
What's this?

10:19.080 --> 10:20.638
Dear, Mel. I'm at the neighbours'.

10:20.840 --> 10:23.400
Dinner's at the grocery store.

10:25.280 --> 10:27.999
Wait a minute, I don't remember this.

10:28.240 --> 10:29.639
Hey, you know something, Peg?

10:29.840 --> 10:32.513
This show is pretty good.

10:33.400 --> 10:34.549
Stupid wife.

10:34.760 --> 10:38.469
Now what am I supposed to eat,
toaster leavings?

10:43.920 --> 10:46.150
Boy, does my life suck.

11:15.880 --> 11:17.108
Al...

11:17.320 --> 11:20.995
...don't you notice something familiar
about that Mel character?

11:21.200 --> 11:23.794
Yeah, both of our lives suck.

11:26.320 --> 11:29.869
Well, I guess it could
be a coincidence.

11:35.960 --> 11:38.235
Hi, Mel, I'm home.

11:40.920 --> 11:43.480
Look what I got
from the Shop at Home network.

11:43.680 --> 11:46.877
A whole week's worth of bonbons.

11:50.640 --> 11:52.631
Where are we supposed to put them?

11:54.720 --> 11:57.359
Well, I'm supposed
to k eep them cool.

11:57.560 --> 12:00.279
How about your side of the bed?

12:03.600 --> 12:06.831
Hey! His side of the bed!

12:11.960 --> 12:13.359
Well?

12:13.560 --> 12:16.313
Well, I told them about my family.

12:16.520 --> 12:19.273
I didn't think
they were gonna steal it!

12:19.640 --> 12:23.633
And what, pray tell,
did you tell them about me?

12:34.600 --> 12:35.635
Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.

12:35.840 --> 12:38.434
- Hi, Ben.
- Hi, Naomi.

12:43.720 --> 12:46.234
Can she and I
go to the movies tonight?

12:47.200 --> 12:50.078
Son, don't you think it's time
you got a real girlfriend?

12:51.400 --> 12:53.231
Dad, I do have a real girlfriend.

12:53.440 --> 12:55.749
It's just that this one puts out.

12:57.800 --> 13:00.553
It's a doll, Peg!

13:01.680 --> 13:03.875
How pathetic!

13:06.440 --> 13:10.035
- Are you guys watching this new show?
- This is the greatest.

13:10.240 --> 13:13.915
It's like watching a family
of chimps that can talk.

13:14.440 --> 13:17.318
No, it's not. It's us.

13:17.560 --> 13:19.437
Kelly went down to try out
for the show...

13:19.640 --> 13:22.837
...she told the writers about us
and got plagiarized.

13:23.040 --> 13:26.589
I did not! They just took my idea.

13:27.920 --> 13:29.035
Well, even so...

13:29.240 --> 13:32.596
...I'd say it's time we start looking
at ourselves and laughing more.

13:32.800 --> 13:37.078
Yeah. Personally, I'd be flattered
if somebody satirized us on TV.

13:42.880 --> 13:46.714
Mel Pease, did you back your Rambler
into our trash cans again?

13:46.960 --> 13:48.279
Oh, hi, Marla.

13:48.480 --> 13:50.198
Were those trash cans?

13:50.400 --> 13:54.029
I thought the feed store dropped off
another load of pigeon chow.

13:55.080 --> 13:57.799
- I am not a pigeon!
- She's a pigeon.

13:58.480 --> 14:01.870
Washington, are you going to let him
talk to me lik e that?

14:02.800 --> 14:05.075
- Hit him!
- What?

14:05.280 --> 14:07.157
And break a nail?

14:16.760 --> 14:17.909
Oh, so, what am I now?

14:18.120 --> 14:22.079
Just some mindless, pretty-boy,
gold-digging gigolo?

14:28.280 --> 14:30.396
You're darned right, I'm not!

14:31.000 --> 14:34.310
What you tell them about yourself?
That you graduated from Yale?

14:37.920 --> 14:38.875
Harvard.

14:41.120 --> 14:46.035
Oh, come on. Just be thankful at least
one of our reputations is still good.

14:56.360 --> 14:58.510
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, Carrie.

14:58.720 --> 15:02.269
I'm just gonna spend the night
with a few of my school chums here.

15:02.520 --> 15:04.909
Okay, buttercup, but don't do
anything I wouldn't do.

15:05.120 --> 15:08.874
Which, in Mel's case,
means don't do anything.

15:16.200 --> 15:18.839
Al, we've got to do something!

15:19.040 --> 15:21.110
- What?
- Sue!

15:21.360 --> 15:23.874
Sue Fox? To get what?

15:25.200 --> 15:29.432
What, an NFL mug
or a lunch date with John Madden?

15:30.560 --> 15:33.393
No, well, an apology would be nice.

15:33.600 --> 15:36.672
I say we go down there right now
and call them on it, Daddy.

15:36.880 --> 15:38.871
- "We"?
- Please.

15:39.080 --> 15:41.878
They took my creative virginity.

15:42.480 --> 15:45.756
Yeah, she's got a point there, Dad.
She could have still had that.

15:46.720 --> 15:49.598
We'll go down there, but I'm
warning you if they replace this...

15:49.800 --> 15:52.678
...with Don Rickles again
I'm gonna hold you all responsible.

16:05.680 --> 16:09.753
Oh, Al, a real
show-business sound stage.

16:11.120 --> 16:14.396
- A real show-business security guard.
- I'll handle it, pumpkin.

16:14.640 --> 16:16.915
Sorry, folks, this set is off limits.

16:17.120 --> 16:18.872
How'd you get by the guard
at the gate?

16:19.120 --> 16:21.190
They were busy searching
Joe Piscopo.

16:21.440 --> 16:22.555
What?

16:22.760 --> 16:25.593
Piscopo's here again?!

16:29.280 --> 16:30.713
Now, what do we do?

16:30.920 --> 16:34.037
Well, find that Ron Michaels guy,
I guess.

16:34.240 --> 16:35.798
Hey, there he is.

16:36.040 --> 16:38.395
You know, I got a good mind
to just go over there...

16:38.600 --> 16:40.556
...and give him a piece of it.

16:43.760 --> 16:45.512
Although, if somebody had
a good mind...

16:45.720 --> 16:48.553
...why would they wanna share it
with someone they didn't like?

16:48.760 --> 16:53.038
I mean, that would kind of be like
having your cake and meeting it too.

16:53.360 --> 16:54.839
And what is the deal with Trix?

16:55.040 --> 16:57.793
- You know, I've always wondered...
- Pumpkin, pumpkin, pumpkin.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.389
Perhaps I ought to handle this.
Now, you just relax...

17:00.600 --> 17:02.830
...and save your energy for the...

17:03.040 --> 17:05.109
For the ride home.

17:10.119 --> 17:13.476
Excuse me, Mr. Michaels.
I'm Al Bundy.

17:14.079 --> 17:16.355
Here. It's the black Cadillac
with the gold trim...

17:16.560 --> 17:19.028
...and I want it detailed
inside and outside this time.

17:19.880 --> 17:22.269
No, no, no. I'm here to...

17:22.480 --> 17:23.992
Cadillac?

17:25.400 --> 17:26.958
That's right.

17:29.280 --> 17:30.918
Anyway...

17:31.520 --> 17:35.479
I would just like to say that
I'm a huge, huge fan of the show.

17:35.680 --> 17:37.079
The acting, the writing...

17:37.800 --> 17:40.075
- Hi, Ron.
- Hi, Ron.

17:43.480 --> 17:46.074
The gratuitous use
of girls in short skirts.

17:46.720 --> 17:48.631
Everything is just great.

17:49.600 --> 17:52.637
Look, if I need someone to suck up
to me, I'll go to my writers.

17:54.840 --> 17:55.795
What do you want?

17:56.400 --> 17:57.628
Well, about a month ago...

17:57.840 --> 18:01.116
...my daughter Kelly auditioned
for the part of Carrie, didn't get it.

18:01.320 --> 18:04.437
But when she watched the premiere,
she thought you stole her idea...

18:04.640 --> 18:06.790
...and trashed my family.
I'm the kind of guy...

18:07.000 --> 18:09.468
...who can roll with the punches,
but as you can see...

18:09.680 --> 18:12.114
...my wife and kids
are pretty broken up about it.

18:19.960 --> 18:21.712
Bundy...

18:22.000 --> 18:26.118
...I've been in this business
since my wife was a baby.

18:28.040 --> 18:29.758
I've worked with the greats:

18:29.960 --> 18:33.919
Bertinelli, Danza,
Lenny, Squiggy. All of them.

18:34.120 --> 18:35.678
You know what I've learned?

18:35.880 --> 18:38.235
- What?
- Nothing.

18:38.440 --> 18:40.158
That's how TV works, Bundy.

18:40.360 --> 18:41.588
No rhyme. No reason.

18:41.800 --> 18:45.190
We learn less doing it
than you folks learn watching it.

18:45.400 --> 18:46.833
Look...

18:47.120 --> 18:51.193
...between you and me, I'd rather be
doing Shakespeare or Keats, but hey...

18:51.400 --> 18:53.960
...a hit is a hit no matter
where it comes from.

18:54.200 --> 18:55.155
Now, look here.

18:55.360 --> 18:58.830
You betrayed the trust of my little girl
and I think she deserves an apology.

18:59.040 --> 19:02.032
I mean, not one of those
phoney-baloney, show-biz types...

19:02.240 --> 19:04.708
...but I mean a really, truly heartfelt...

19:04.920 --> 19:08.799
How's 500 an episode and I never
see your wage-slave faces again?

19:09.280 --> 19:10.508
Done.

19:11.160 --> 19:13.435
Thank you, Mr. Michaels.

19:13.640 --> 19:16.154
Oh, Dad. I saw that.

19:16.360 --> 19:18.237
I thought we were gonna stand
on principle.

19:18.480 --> 19:21.358
Well, we could, but I found out
you can reach a little higher...

19:21.560 --> 19:23.516
...when you're standing
on a bunch of money.

19:23.720 --> 19:25.790
Come on, family.
It will be a lot of money too.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.992
This show is gonna be a hit.
It could run forever.

19:29.760 --> 19:31.512
Oh, look, it's the Peases.

19:31.720 --> 19:34.518
Let's go. Let's go.

19:43.840 --> 19:45.910
Hi there, I'm...

19:46.160 --> 19:48.116
I'm Al Bundy.

19:49.600 --> 19:50.635
Red Viper.

19:50.840 --> 19:54.310
And I want the inside and outside
detailed this time.

20:09.240 --> 20:12.198
Here's a Cadillac for you,
sweetheart.

20:13.120 --> 20:17.796
Just think of it as an apology that goes
zero to 60 in seven seconds.

20:19.240 --> 20:22.038
Hello, Shop at Home network?
Yes, I'd like to order...

20:22.240 --> 20:26.199
...your Playmate of the Month
action figure set, please.

20:27.840 --> 20:31.196
Don't you think you ought to wait
until the show's been on for a while...

20:31.400 --> 20:34.472
...before spending
a year's worth of profits?

20:34.680 --> 20:36.750
Called royalties, babe.

20:37.800 --> 20:39.199
And no.

20:39.440 --> 20:41.476
Hey, guys, it's almost time
for it to come on.

20:41.680 --> 20:44.877
Fox network viewing positions,
please.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.514
All right, Peg, hit the button.

20:50.720 --> 20:51.835
Tonight on Fox:

20:52.040 --> 20:53.314
Stay tuned for...

20:55.480 --> 20:57.118
...The Family Keats.

20:57.320 --> 20:58.639
What?

20:59.200 --> 21:02.715
Hi, guys, have you heard the news?
They cancelled Pease in a Pod.

21:02.960 --> 21:04.552
What?

21:05.200 --> 21:06.679
But why? I thought it was a hit.

21:06.920 --> 21:09.878
Well, some woman in Michigan
didn't like it.

21:11.440 --> 21:14.796
She also didn't like football,
so that's gone too.

21:15.320 --> 21:17.595
On the bright side,
I hear some wonderful things...

21:17.800 --> 21:19.472
...about this Keats-family thing.

21:22.040 --> 21:26.352
In the 18th century
Was a man wrote poetry

21:26.600 --> 21:30.354
And he had a family
It's the Family Keats

21:30.560 --> 21:32.118
Starring Don Rickles.

21:36.920 --> 21:39.593
Peg, hand me the remote, please.

21:42.560 --> 21:44.676
Dad, you have it pointing
the wrong way.

21:45.920 --> 21:48.514
Not if there's a God, pumpkin.
