WEBVTT

00:02.269 --> 00:03.837
Okay, here's how
it's going to go.

00:03.837 --> 00:07.341
Seven-card stud.
Two cards down, four cards up.

00:07.341 --> 00:09.476
Last card's a buy.
No check and raise.

00:09.476 --> 00:11.178
I'm about to be
shaken down.

00:11.178 --> 00:12.513
Visions of grade school.

00:12.513 --> 00:14.781
At least he hasn't
put a visor on yet.

00:15.148 --> 00:16.717
Good news is, I'm already poor

00:16.717 --> 00:18.285
so I've got nothing to lose.

00:18.285 --> 00:19.686
Everybody relax.

00:19.686 --> 00:20.854
It's just
a friendly game.

00:20.854 --> 00:22.523
We're all here
to have fun.

00:22.523 --> 00:24.224
I heard the greatest joke
the other day.

00:24.224 --> 00:26.393
No jokes; we're playing cards.

00:26.860 --> 00:29.196
Josh, I've never seen
you so aggressive

00:29.196 --> 00:30.664
and domineering.

00:30.664 --> 00:32.699
Why weren't you this way
when I was dating you?

00:32.699 --> 00:34.668
Will you shut up?

00:34.668 --> 00:36.770
Oh, and now you grow a spine.

00:36.770 --> 00:40.474
Let's just play.
Where are the cards?

00:40.474 --> 00:42.776
Oh, the cards?

00:43.443 --> 00:47.314
Ah, there's the Josh
I know and dumped.

00:47.314 --> 00:50.183
Don't worry, Mr. Vegas,
I've got some cards in my room.

00:50.684 --> 00:52.419
If you're looking for cards

00:52.419 --> 00:54.555
I've got Josh's deck
right here.

00:54.555 --> 00:56.490
You stole Josh's cards?

00:56.490 --> 00:59.059
Stole, borrowed,
who's keeping score?

00:59.059 --> 01:01.528
The point is, I want
to make you a proposition.

01:01.528 --> 01:02.429
No.

01:02.729 --> 01:04.464
Here's the plan:
During the game

01:04.464 --> 01:05.933
I'll look over
everyone's shoulder

01:05.933 --> 01:07.267
and signal
how you should bet.

01:07.267 --> 01:09.202
We'll split
the winnings 70-30.

01:09.202 --> 01:10.871
I can't cheat my friends.

01:11.104 --> 01:12.439
But I can.

01:12.606 --> 01:14.741
That's the beauty of this plan.

01:15.108 --> 01:19.012
Roxie, I will see your
bet and raise you five.

01:19.012 --> 01:20.814
Too rich for my blood.

01:20.814 --> 01:22.416
Fold.
Fold.

01:22.416 --> 01:25.552
I should fold...
unless you're bluffing.

01:25.552 --> 01:27.054
Sabrina

01:27.054 --> 01:28.622
I think your cat's
having a convulsion.

01:28.622 --> 01:30.257
I think he just needs
some fresh air.

01:32.225 --> 01:36.463
Any of you chicks
up for five-card stud?

Yes, ma'am,
what can I get for you?

02:24.945 --> 02:26.580
Excuse me,
we were here first.

02:26.580 --> 02:28.582
Oh, and just because
men were here first

02:28.582 --> 02:31.184
you think women are supposed
to wait on you hand and foot?

02:31.184 --> 02:33.587
Well, think again,
Mr. Hairy Back. Go!

02:33.587 --> 02:35.188
Decaf?

02:35.188 --> 02:36.657
What's with Aunt Hilda?

02:36.657 --> 02:38.492
President Banning
broke up with her.

02:38.492 --> 02:40.060
Now she says she's
through with men.

02:40.060 --> 02:41.161
Next.

02:41.361 --> 02:42.596
Aunt Hilda.

02:42.596 --> 02:44.898
I'm really sorry about you
and President Banning.

02:44.898 --> 02:46.466
But, you know,
that's no reason

02:46.466 --> 02:47.768
to take it out
on all men.

02:47.768 --> 02:49.636
There's a better way
to deal with your feelings.

02:49.636 --> 02:50.971
I know, I know.

02:50.971 --> 02:53.106
Talk through it,
feel the pain.

02:53.106 --> 02:54.374
I'd rather
cause the pain.

02:54.374 --> 02:56.109
Or we could go shopping.

02:56.109 --> 02:58.612
I like your way.

02:59.379 --> 03:02.549
Ooh, essence of hemlock.

03:02.716 --> 03:04.918
And a dragon-skin pen.

03:04.918 --> 03:07.421
Disgusting,
but I've got to have one.

03:08.989 --> 03:10.057
You know, you were right

03:10.057 --> 03:11.591
about curing
Hilda's breakup blues.

03:11.591 --> 03:13.393
Shopping is just
what the doctor ordered.

03:13.393 --> 03:15.295
Yeah, but he didn't
order six hours of it.

03:15.295 --> 03:18.031
My feet are swelling up
like two bloated trolls.

03:18.031 --> 03:20.033
That reminds me,
I need to pick up some trolls.

03:20.033 --> 03:21.568
Let's swing by
Saks Fifth Century.

03:21.568 --> 03:23.837
Uh, Hilda, you know what,
you go ahead.

03:23.837 --> 03:25.272
Sabrina and I
are pretty wiped out.

03:25.272 --> 03:26.640
Yeah, we'll meet
you at the house

03:26.640 --> 03:27.641
if that's okay
with you.

03:27.641 --> 03:28.742
That's great with me.

03:28.742 --> 03:30.944
You two lollygaggers
have been slowing me down.

03:30.944 --> 03:32.746
Oh, my God.

03:32.746 --> 03:35.215
I've been looking
for one of these everywhere.

03:35.215 --> 03:37.584
Excuse me, sir, what is this?

03:37.584 --> 03:38.719
Psst, Harvey.

03:38.719 --> 03:39.853
Harvey.

03:39.853 --> 03:40.921
Did you say something?

03:40.921 --> 03:43.223
Plants can't talk,
you idiot.

03:43.223 --> 03:44.891
Oh, but cats can.

03:44.891 --> 03:46.026
I'm such a fool.

03:46.026 --> 03:47.561
I've got a poker game
to get to.

03:47.561 --> 03:48.662
I know.

03:48.662 --> 03:50.230
Want to go home a winner?

03:50.230 --> 03:52.132
I'd love to. How?

03:52.132 --> 03:53.300
Think about it.

03:53.300 --> 03:54.968
You're a guy
who stinks at poker.

03:54.968 --> 03:57.404
I'm a cat with no scruples.

03:57.404 --> 03:58.538
Huh?

03:58.538 --> 04:00.507
Oh, this could
take forever.

04:00.507 --> 04:01.441
Here's the deal:

04:01.441 --> 04:03.376
During the game,
I'll sit behind Josh

04:03.376 --> 04:04.578
and let you know what he's got.

04:04.578 --> 04:07.748
You'll go home a winner
and we'll split the take 80-20.

04:07.748 --> 04:09.983
Salem, that's cheating.

04:09.983 --> 04:12.219
Ugh, another one.

04:12.219 --> 04:15.455
What is wrong
with this generation?

04:15.889 --> 04:20.060
I swear Sabrina's cat is humming
"If I Were a Rich Man."

04:20.060 --> 04:21.828
I'm singing a pretty
happy tune myself

04:21.828 --> 04:23.263
thanks to Kinkle here.

04:23.263 --> 04:24.798
Harvey, don't take
this personally

04:24.798 --> 04:27.534
but you are the worst poker
player I have ever seen.

04:27.534 --> 04:30.036
Gee, how can I take that
personally?

04:30.036 --> 04:32.105
Don't get too attached
to those chips.

04:32.105 --> 04:34.908
I think my luck's
about to change.

04:34.908 --> 04:36.843
( <i>humming</i> )

04:37.077 --> 04:39.780
Now the cat's humming
"We're In the Money."

04:42.315 --> 04:44.985
Well, after
three hours of soaking

04:44.985 --> 04:47.454
my feet are finally back
to their original size.

04:47.454 --> 04:49.790
Tell Aunt Hilda I waited,
but I got a paper to write.

04:49.790 --> 04:51.491
Oh, honey, I'm sure
she'll be so excited

04:51.491 --> 04:52.826
about all the things
she bought

04:52.826 --> 04:56.296
she'll forget we even
went shopping with her.

04:56.296 --> 04:58.398
That was so much fun!

04:58.832 --> 05:00.700
What's in the box?

05:00.700 --> 05:01.768
What on earth
is that?

05:01.768 --> 05:02.702
Guess.

05:03.103 --> 05:05.172
Uh... refrigerator.
No.

05:05.172 --> 05:06.373
Freezer.
No.

05:06.373 --> 05:07.741
A washer-dryer combo?

05:07.741 --> 05:09.276
No. That's coming Tuesday.

05:09.276 --> 05:11.678
What is it?
A fiancé!

05:12.846 --> 05:14.381
( <i>growls</i> )
( <i>growls</i> )

05:15.448 --> 05:16.950
Hey, I know you.

05:16.950 --> 05:19.186
You're the conductor
from the Halloween
mystery train.

05:19.186 --> 05:22.823
Right. And Hilda's
just signed up for
the ride of her life.

05:22.823 --> 05:24.991
From what I understand,
it's nonstop.

05:24.991 --> 05:26.226
Excuse us, will you?

05:26.893 --> 05:27.761
( <i>Will growls</i> )

05:28.361 --> 05:29.996
Harvey, do you
call my bet or not?

05:29.996 --> 05:31.264
What are you
waiting for?

05:31.264 --> 05:33.366
Just give the man your wallet
and be done with it.

05:33.366 --> 05:35.001
He could be bluffing.

05:35.001 --> 05:38.839
But I guess to be on
the safe side, I should fold.

05:38.839 --> 05:41.007
But I won't. Call.

05:41.007 --> 05:43.777
Unfortunately for you,
I wasn't bluffing.

05:43.777 --> 05:45.879
Full house, kings high.

05:45.879 --> 05:47.647
Ah, not so fast.

05:47.647 --> 05:49.916
Full house, aces high.

05:49.916 --> 05:52.485
Okay, now the cat
is singing and dancing.

05:52.652 --> 05:53.987
( <i>humming stops</i> )

05:53.987 --> 05:57.357
Miles, you've got to get
off the decongestants.

05:57.691 --> 05:59.893
Anyway, so after
I found this great deal

05:59.893 --> 06:01.528
on ointment for piranha bites

06:01.528 --> 06:03.263
I popped into
Just Cauldrons.

06:03.263 --> 06:05.532
I'm standing there, looking
at the new tailgate models

06:05.532 --> 06:08.168
when all of a sudden,
I look over to the food court

06:08.168 --> 06:10.103
and I become paralyzed.

06:10.103 --> 06:10.971
You saw Will.

06:10.971 --> 06:11.972
No.

06:11.972 --> 06:13.807
I saw they jacked up
the price of corn dogs

06:13.807 --> 06:15.275
to seven dollars.

06:15.275 --> 06:16.543
Is that not outrageous?

06:16.543 --> 06:18.345
A crime. But what
does that have to do

06:18.345 --> 06:19.646
with you
running into Will?

06:19.646 --> 06:21.748
Patience.
It's a fabulous story.

06:21.748 --> 06:22.849
( <i>growls</i> )

06:22.849 --> 06:24.050
Anyway

06:24.050 --> 06:25.752
I'm standing there
with my jaw on the floor

06:25.752 --> 06:27.187
and who do you think
bumps into me?

06:27.187 --> 06:28.788
Will.
No.

06:29.222 --> 06:32.125
The saleslady showing Will
the exact same cauldron

06:32.125 --> 06:33.693
I had just been looking at.

06:33.693 --> 06:35.762
And that's when you knew
you'd found Mr. Right?

06:35.762 --> 06:36.630
No.

06:37.063 --> 06:38.999
That's when Will looked out
to the food court

06:38.999 --> 06:41.234
and said, "Seven dollars
for a corn dog?

06:41.234 --> 06:43.036
That's outrageous."

06:43.036 --> 06:44.738
That's when I knew.

06:44.938 --> 06:46.139
Of course.

06:46.139 --> 06:47.607
Oh, before I forget

06:47.607 --> 06:49.142
the wedding's this weekend.

06:49.142 --> 06:50.310
What?
This weekend?

06:50.310 --> 06:51.478
Oh, yeah,
Saturday afternoon.

06:51.478 --> 06:52.512
Kind of dressy casual.

06:52.512 --> 06:55.682
Will, would you excuse us
for a moment?

06:56.783 --> 06:58.885
Let me guess, you're
clawing at my skin

06:58.885 --> 07:01.588
because you're afraid
I'm going to make you wear

07:01.588 --> 07:03.056
ugly bridesmaid's dresses.

07:03.056 --> 07:06.026
Well, not to worry.
They're maroon and yellow.

07:06.026 --> 07:07.060
Maroon and yellow?

07:07.060 --> 07:09.029
Aunt Hilda, look,
you just broke up

07:09.029 --> 07:10.397
with President Banning.

07:10.397 --> 07:12.299
Don't you think you might
be acting impulsively

07:12.299 --> 07:13.500
because you're
on the rebound?

07:13.500 --> 07:15.368
Sabrina, I've been
looking for my true love

07:15.368 --> 07:16.970
for over 600 years.

07:16.970 --> 07:19.506
And if I find him on
the rebound, on a train

07:19.506 --> 07:20.840
or in an outlet mall

07:20.840 --> 07:23.043
I'm going for it.

07:23.043 --> 07:24.945
Honey, it's true
that he's a nice man

07:24.945 --> 07:26.413
he's attractive

07:26.413 --> 07:28.348
he has a job--
always a plus--

07:28.348 --> 07:30.583
but don't you think
you should get
to know each other

07:30.583 --> 07:31.885
before you jump
into marriage?

07:31.885 --> 07:33.753
I'm telling you,
I know true love

07:33.753 --> 07:35.088
when I see it at the mall.

07:35.088 --> 07:36.222
And this is it.

07:36.222 --> 07:37.958
Now all I want from you two

07:37.958 --> 07:40.126
are your blessings
and your dress sizes.

07:40.126 --> 07:41.328
Now if you'll excuse me

07:41.328 --> 07:43.697
Will and I have
to go pick out our rings.

07:43.997 --> 07:46.700
Great idea I had
taking her shopping.

07:46.700 --> 07:48.101
Aunt Zelda,
what are we going to do?

07:48.101 --> 07:49.736
We are going
to make peace

07:49.736 --> 07:51.771
with maroon and
yellow, I suppose.

07:51.771 --> 07:52.772
Ooh, I shudder to think

07:52.772 --> 07:54.441
what the shoes are
going to look like.

07:54.441 --> 07:56.843
We can't let her get married
to a guy she bonded with

07:56.843 --> 07:58.712
over cauldrons and corn dogs.

07:58.712 --> 08:00.513
I don't think
we have a choice.

08:00.513 --> 08:03.083
Your Aunt Hilda's a
very headstrong woman.

08:03.083 --> 08:05.018
You know the oddest part

08:05.018 --> 08:06.753
is that on that
mystery train

08:06.753 --> 08:08.989
I could've sworn
Will fancied me.

08:08.989 --> 08:10.190
That's it.

08:10.190 --> 08:11.291
You just gave me an idea.

08:11.291 --> 08:13.059
When they get back
from the jewelry store

08:13.059 --> 08:15.628
I'll distract Aunt Hilda
while you throw
yourself at Will.

08:15.628 --> 08:17.063
He succumbs to your charms

08:17.063 --> 08:18.798
she sees him in a
compromising position

08:18.798 --> 08:20.266
and comes to her senses.

08:20.266 --> 08:21.801
Sabrina...

08:21.801 --> 08:24.304
forgive me if I'm not
entirely comfortable

08:24.304 --> 08:26.306
seducing my sister's fiancé.

08:26.306 --> 08:29.342
I mean, it's one thing
to steal her prom date.

08:29.342 --> 08:30.410
It's for her own good.

08:30.410 --> 08:32.479
The only way we can
save Aunt Hilda

08:32.479 --> 08:34.914
is with your
overwhelming beauty.

08:34.914 --> 08:38.051
Well, she is my sister.

08:39.652 --> 08:42.122
Zellie, Sabrina,
we're back.

08:42.122 --> 08:44.124
Don't you want to see
our wedding rings?

08:44.858 --> 08:45.992
Do I ever.

08:47.360 --> 08:48.561
Mood rings?

08:48.561 --> 08:49.863
Aren't they gorgeous?

08:49.863 --> 08:51.197
Well, who can see
in this light.

08:51.197 --> 08:53.299
Come into the kitchen,
let me really
check them out.

08:53.299 --> 08:54.501
Be right back.

08:54.501 --> 08:57.237
And if you're lucky,
my mood will be green.

09:05.078 --> 09:06.913
Hello again, Will.

09:06.913 --> 09:08.448
As in...

09:09.049 --> 09:12.085
"Where there's a will,
there's a way."

09:12.085 --> 09:16.256
As in "Will he or won't he?"

09:16.990 --> 09:22.195
Or my personal favorite,
"A man will be a man."

09:22.195 --> 09:24.764
Don't forget
"last will and testament."

09:24.764 --> 09:25.799
Oh!

09:27.500 --> 09:29.836
That's a very
interesting dress.

09:29.836 --> 09:31.271
I'm glad you like it.

09:31.504 --> 09:33.706
What else do you like, Will?

09:33.706 --> 09:35.508
I like Hilda.

09:35.508 --> 09:36.776
And corn dogs.

09:36.776 --> 09:37.844
Really?

09:37.977 --> 09:39.813
I thought you liked me best.

09:39.813 --> 09:40.613
No.

09:41.381 --> 09:43.850
I said I thought
you liked me best!

09:43.850 --> 09:45.585
No, ow!

09:45.585 --> 09:47.921
Jiminy Cricket,
would you look
at that?

09:47.921 --> 09:50.123
What is going on here?

09:50.123 --> 09:51.424
This is not how it looks.

09:51.424 --> 09:53.159
Your sister
just threw herself at me.

09:53.159 --> 09:54.294
Don't lie to me.

09:54.294 --> 09:55.929
Your mood ring is green.

09:55.929 --> 09:57.163
I'm not lying.

09:57.163 --> 09:58.832
I was set up here.

09:58.832 --> 10:00.733
It's you I love,
not this tramp.

10:00.733 --> 10:03.103
Oh, so now
my sister's a tramp?

10:03.736 --> 10:06.005
Well, you do look
a little trampy in that dress.

10:06.005 --> 10:07.841
She was determined to
have her way with me.

10:07.841 --> 10:09.008
I tried to push her aside.

10:09.008 --> 10:10.777
She was relentless
in her pursuit.

10:10.944 --> 10:12.779
Hilda, the only one
for me is you.

10:12.779 --> 10:14.080
You have to believe me.

10:14.080 --> 10:15.982
No, I don't.
You betrayed me.

10:15.982 --> 10:17.150
I'm going to zap you back

10:17.150 --> 10:19.352
to the outlet mall
you crawled out of.

10:21.554 --> 10:24.023
Aunt Hilda,
I'm so sorry.

10:24.023 --> 10:25.592
But I guess
this just goes to prove

10:25.592 --> 10:27.560
he wasn't
your true love after all.

10:27.560 --> 10:29.696
My true love?
I hardly knew the guy.

10:29.696 --> 10:31.664
He meant nothing to me.

10:31.664 --> 10:35.201
And now I'll never
see him again.

10:39.873 --> 10:42.242
Oh, my God!
Aunt Hilda broke!

10:42.242 --> 10:43.376
I can't believe it.

10:43.376 --> 10:44.978
The only time a witch
falls to pieces

10:44.978 --> 10:47.213
is when she's separated
from her soul mate.

10:47.213 --> 10:48.515
Oh...

10:48.982 --> 10:50.783
Oh, we were wrong, Sabrina.

10:50.783 --> 10:52.819
They really <i>were</i> in love.

10:52.819 --> 10:55.121
And we got the bright idea
to break them up.

10:55.121 --> 10:58.024
Actually, sweetheart,
that was you.

11:04.731 --> 11:06.666
I feel horrible.

11:07.200 --> 11:08.968
We got to get Aunt
Hilda back together.

11:08.968 --> 11:11.704
Hey... I found her lips.

11:11.704 --> 11:13.840
Actually, I think that's a nose.

11:15.642 --> 11:18.178
This is a lot harder
than Mr. Potato Head.

11:18.178 --> 11:20.780
We're going to need
a professional, honey.

11:20.780 --> 11:23.616
We can't fix Hilda,
but someone else can.

11:23.616 --> 11:25.785
Send us an expert,
like Rodin.

11:27.720 --> 11:29.289
( <i>with French accent):</i>
Ooh-la-la.

11:29.289 --> 11:30.323
It will be my pleasure

11:30.323 --> 11:32.192
to sculpt such beautiful,
gorgeous women

11:32.192 --> 11:33.393
such as yourselves.

11:33.593 --> 11:35.595
Actually, we just need you
to fix my broken aunt.

11:36.129 --> 11:38.131
<i>Voilà, c'en est fait.</i>

11:38.131 --> 11:39.599
Ooh, that means it's done.

11:39.599 --> 11:40.833
Four years of French.

11:40.833 --> 11:43.069
Hey...
what about this piece?

11:43.069 --> 11:44.704
Appendix-- don't need.

11:44.704 --> 11:46.806
Okay, well, now that you've
put her back together

11:46.806 --> 11:48.274
how do you bring
her back to life?

11:48.274 --> 11:50.777
I am artist,
not genetic engineer.

11:50.777 --> 11:54.280
If you want a heart beating
or a plasma flowing

11:54.280 --> 11:56.683
you should consult
a specialist.

11:59.152 --> 12:01.221
"Ed's Life and
Storage Warehouse.

12:01.221 --> 12:03.990
We revive your loved ones
at factory-direct prices."
This is perfect!

12:03.990 --> 12:04.991
No, it's not.

12:04.991 --> 12:06.993
I have heard
about this quack.

12:06.993 --> 12:08.795
He's unlicensed, unethical

12:08.795 --> 12:12.432
and from what I can see in
this photograph, <i>unwashed.</i>

12:12.432 --> 12:14.801
I am not putting
my sister's fate
in his hands.

12:14.801 --> 12:16.035
Well, what choice
do we have?

12:16.035 --> 12:18.705
<i>Hello--</i> brilliant
research scientist.

12:18.705 --> 12:22.242
Surely I can find a way
to bring Hilda back to life.

12:22.342 --> 12:24.277
To the "labtop."

12:25.345 --> 12:28.248
Oh, but we get a free bag
of white blood cells

12:28.248 --> 12:29.249
just for coming in!

12:35.588 --> 12:36.589
Eureka!

12:36.589 --> 12:37.590
You've got it?

12:37.590 --> 12:38.591
No...

12:38.591 --> 12:39.592
but I have figured out

12:39.592 --> 12:41.494
how to make an amoeba
come when I call him.

12:41.494 --> 12:42.495
That's it?

12:42.495 --> 12:44.664
You've been working at this
for two days.

12:44.664 --> 12:47.433
If I have to work at this
labtop for 2,000 days

12:47.433 --> 12:50.136
I am going to find
a way to bring my
sister back to life.

12:50.770 --> 12:53.139
Here, Fluffy, Fluffy.

12:53.139 --> 12:54.040
( <i>smooching</i> )

12:55.074 --> 12:56.909
Well, I can't
wait that long...

12:57.076 --> 12:58.711
and neither
can Aunt Hilda.

13:09.022 --> 13:10.990
Okay... I get
the "storage" part

13:10.990 --> 13:13.993
but I'm not seeing
a lot of "life" around here.

13:13.993 --> 13:16.329
Welcome to Ed's...

13:16.329 --> 13:19.699
where the customer
is always right.

13:19.699 --> 13:21.634
At the moment,
the customer's a
little creeped out.

13:21.634 --> 13:24.304
I'm Sabrina Spellman
and this is my Aunt Hilda.

13:24.304 --> 13:27.974
Oh, yes-- frozen in a state
of perpetual heartbreak.

13:27.974 --> 13:30.143
Tragic...
but good for business.

13:30.143 --> 13:32.078
What can I do for you?

13:32.512 --> 13:34.947
Well, I was hoping you could
bring her back to life.

13:34.947 --> 13:37.183
Ooh... that's going
to cost you.

13:37.183 --> 13:39.385
Oh, that's okay, as long
as you take credit cards.

13:39.385 --> 13:41.287
You know, I just got
bumped up to Platinum.

13:41.287 --> 13:44.490
No, your money's
no good here.

13:44.490 --> 13:49.462
A witch must pay... with
a personal sacrifice.

13:49.462 --> 13:51.764
I'm getting that creeped-out
feeling again.

13:51.764 --> 13:53.933
In exchange
for reviving your aunt

13:53.933 --> 13:56.869
you must be willing
to give up your true love.

13:56.869 --> 13:58.371
Whoa, I have
to give up Josh?

13:58.371 --> 14:01.874
Not necessarily, but
you have to be willing
to take that gamble.

14:01.874 --> 14:04.944
Are you willing to risk
<i>your own</i> love life

14:04.944 --> 14:06.379
to save your aunt's?

14:06.379 --> 14:07.780
You know, Ed...

14:07.780 --> 14:10.350
I am really happy
with my love life these days.

14:10.350 --> 14:11.751
You know, is there anything else
I could sacrifice

14:11.751 --> 14:13.252
like give up Gummy Bears?

14:13.252 --> 14:19.058
Sorry. This is why
most of my customers
opt for storage.

14:19.926 --> 14:22.462
Well... I'm the one
that did this to you.

14:22.462 --> 14:24.931
So... I've got
to make the sacrifice.

14:25.164 --> 14:26.499
( <i>sighs</i> )

14:26.499 --> 14:27.700
All right.

14:27.700 --> 14:28.868
It's a deal.

14:39.712 --> 14:41.714
What a rush!

14:41.714 --> 14:42.882
Who are you?

14:42.882 --> 14:43.883
Oh, this is Ed.

14:43.883 --> 14:45.585
He brought you
back to life.

14:45.585 --> 14:46.452
Gee.

14:46.686 --> 14:47.887
Thanks, Ed.

14:47.887 --> 14:49.122
Don't mention it.

14:49.322 --> 14:53.493
Uh, just out of morbid
curiosity, why was I dead?

14:53.493 --> 14:54.761
See...
when I didn't believe

14:54.761 --> 14:56.462
that you were truly
in love with Will

14:56.462 --> 14:58.398
I came up with a plan
to drive him away...

14:58.398 --> 14:59.832
but he really is
your true love.

14:59.832 --> 15:01.667
So, you froze and shattered
into pieces

15:01.667 --> 15:03.669
for which I'm really,
really, really sorry.

15:03.669 --> 15:05.605
Not half as sorry as I am.

15:05.605 --> 15:08.541
I have to go find
my true love... again.

15:08.541 --> 15:10.810
Ooh, free
white blood cells.

15:10.810 --> 15:13.479
These make great
stocking stuffers.

15:13.713 --> 15:15.281
You're all done.

15:15.281 --> 15:16.282
Thanks.

15:16.282 --> 15:17.784
Um, you know
about that whole...

15:17.784 --> 15:19.786
( <i>chuckling</i> ):
love life/sacrifice thing?

15:19.786 --> 15:22.255
You know, I know the Gummy Bears
didn't fly for you

15:22.255 --> 15:25.091
but what if I cut back on my
usage of the term, "Woo-hoo"?

15:25.091 --> 15:27.960
Yes... that would be
a big sacrifice for you

15:27.960 --> 15:29.929
but <i>no.</i>

15:32.432 --> 15:33.433
Hey, Sabrina.

15:33.433 --> 15:34.434
You're here just in time

15:34.434 --> 15:35.435
to see Harvey wipe us out

15:35.435 --> 15:36.669
for the 12th time in a row.

15:36.669 --> 15:40.006
Harvey? The worst poker player
in all the planet?

15:40.006 --> 15:42.341
And yet, the person
with the most chips.

15:43.709 --> 15:46.712
I got a feeling your luck
is about to change.

15:49.115 --> 15:50.450
Harvey, the
bet is to you.

15:50.450 --> 15:51.584
What are you
going to do?

15:51.751 --> 15:53.986
Let's see, should I fold?

15:53.986 --> 15:54.921
( <i>sneezes</i> )

15:54.921 --> 15:56.155
I guess I'm in.

15:56.155 --> 15:56.956
( <i>sneezes</i> )

15:56.956 --> 15:57.790
Actually, I'll fold.

15:57.790 --> 15:59.392
( <i>sneezes</i> )
I'm in. I'm in.

15:59.392 --> 16:01.661
Okay, straight
flush, jacks high.

16:01.661 --> 16:02.795
What do you got?

16:02.795 --> 16:04.831
Pair of tens.

16:04.831 --> 16:07.500
Ha! Finally, all is right
with the world.

16:07.500 --> 16:08.935
Kinkle's losing again.

16:08.935 --> 16:10.102
( <i>sneezes</i> )

16:10.102 --> 16:11.771
The cat's not doing
so good, either.

16:11.771 --> 16:14.140
Gosh, Harvey, what happened
to your winning streak?

16:14.140 --> 16:15.341
SABRINA:
I guess

16:15.341 --> 16:17.677
he just ran
into a <i>spell</i> of bad luck.

16:17.677 --> 16:19.278
Um, Josh,
before you get

16:19.278 --> 16:20.379
into the next hand

16:20.379 --> 16:22.148
can I talk to you
for a minute?

16:22.281 --> 16:23.416
Uh, yeah, sure.

16:26.819 --> 16:27.920
What's going on?

16:29.155 --> 16:31.557
I just want to make
sure that you know

16:31.557 --> 16:33.793
that if anything
should ever happen

16:33.793 --> 16:35.495
and we can't
be together...

16:35.495 --> 16:38.130
I'll always love you.

16:38.931 --> 16:41.400
Could you take off that visor?

16:41.400 --> 16:43.102
What are you talking about?
Are you okay?

16:43.102 --> 16:44.403
I'm fine.

16:44.403 --> 16:47.106
It's just... you never know
what's going to happen.

16:47.540 --> 16:48.908
Sabrina...

16:49.141 --> 16:51.143
I don't know why
you're talking like this

16:51.143 --> 16:54.313
but I love you,
and I never want to lose you.

16:54.313 --> 16:56.015
I don't want to lose you,
either.

16:56.015 --> 16:59.085
You're the sweetest,
most caring guy I've ever known.

17:03.756 --> 17:05.091
Now... get in there

17:05.091 --> 17:07.560
and shake down my friends
for all they're worth.

17:14.233 --> 17:17.103
...and a little bit
of frog essence...

17:17.537 --> 17:19.705
and... presto!

17:20.206 --> 17:22.108
The amoeba is dead.

17:23.209 --> 17:26.846
52 hours straight
and still no Hilda
to show for it.

17:26.846 --> 17:28.214
What you doing?

17:28.214 --> 17:30.149
Do you mind? I'm
trying to bring my
dear sister ba...

17:30.149 --> 17:32.418
Hilda! I brought
you back to life!

17:32.418 --> 17:35.621
Sure... if it makes
you feel better.

17:35.621 --> 17:36.689
So needy.

17:36.689 --> 17:38.190
Anyway,
we're getting married here

17:38.190 --> 17:39.191
this Saturday.

17:39.191 --> 17:40.192
So, clean this all up.

17:40.192 --> 17:41.027
Okay.

17:41.193 --> 17:42.261
Listen, you two.

17:42.261 --> 17:44.664
I am so glad
that you are back together

17:44.664 --> 17:47.066
and I never should've
doubted your love

17:47.066 --> 17:50.036
and I'm really sorry
that I threw myself at you.

17:50.036 --> 17:51.037
Forget about it.

17:51.037 --> 17:52.672
I was over it
while it was happening.

17:52.672 --> 17:53.673
Oh.

17:53.673 --> 17:55.708
That's... good.

18:00.112 --> 18:01.614
So, how do you feel?

18:01.614 --> 18:03.616
I'm excited...
yet a little worried

18:03.616 --> 18:06.252
that Hilda's running
an hour and a half late.

18:06.252 --> 18:08.521
Ooh, you really don't know her
that well yet, do you?

18:08.521 --> 18:10.222
You want me to go check
around for you?

18:10.222 --> 18:12.992
Nah, nah, I don't
want to put <i>you</i> out.
Wait a minute.

18:12.992 --> 18:15.294
You almost destroyed
my relationship.

18:15.294 --> 18:16.596
Yeah... go.

18:18.631 --> 18:20.132
( <i>sobbing</i> )

18:20.132 --> 18:22.101
Aunt Hilda, everything okay?

18:22.101 --> 18:23.936
( <i>Hilda sniffling</i> ):
Fine, honey.

18:24.370 --> 18:25.938
( <i>sniffling</i> )

18:25.938 --> 18:27.940
Oh, why are
you two crying?

18:27.940 --> 18:29.275
( <i>sobbing</i> )

18:29.275 --> 18:31.243
Make that three.

18:32.111 --> 18:34.614
I'm going to miss all you guys
so much.

18:34.614 --> 18:35.781
Oh, Aunt Hilda

18:35.781 --> 18:38.084
we're still going
to see each other.

18:38.284 --> 18:41.120
It's never going to be
like it was, though.

18:41.120 --> 18:42.955
But it will
be wonderful

18:42.955 --> 18:44.924
in a whole
different way.

18:44.924 --> 18:47.460
Yeah, you'll have new adventures
with the man you love.

18:47.460 --> 18:49.695
Well, they'll have to be
awfully good adventures

18:49.695 --> 18:50.997
to top the ones we've had--

18:50.997 --> 18:53.232
crossing swords
with pirates...

18:53.232 --> 18:56.102
Taking a trip to look
at time shares in Hell.

18:56.302 --> 18:58.437
I'll never forget
when we skied on Mars

18:58.437 --> 19:00.406
or when we rode
the roller coaster

19:00.406 --> 19:01.641
on the rings of Saturn

19:01.641 --> 19:03.976
or when you rescued me
from the volcano...

19:03.976 --> 19:05.411
or when you... took me in

19:05.411 --> 19:07.813
and raised me like I was
your own daughter.

19:07.813 --> 19:09.382
( <i>all sobbing</i> )

19:10.816 --> 19:13.886
And now, it's the happiest day
of my life.

19:14.987 --> 19:17.857
...which is why we are
gathered here today

19:17.857 --> 19:20.960
to join these two together
in holy matrimony.

19:20.960 --> 19:22.294
Hilda looks so beautiful.

19:22.294 --> 19:23.663
And so happy.

19:24.463 --> 19:26.899
I swear, if that cat
starts singing "Oh, Promise Me"

19:26.899 --> 19:27.900
I'm out of here.

19:27.900 --> 19:29.635
I don't mean
to be critical

19:29.635 --> 19:31.637
but don't
the bridesmaids look

19:31.637 --> 19:34.707
like they should be playing
at the Rose Bowl?

19:34.707 --> 19:36.308
PRIEST:
Do you, Will

19:36.308 --> 19:39.111
take Hilda,
to be your lawfully wedded wife?

19:39.111 --> 19:40.846
( <i>growls playfully</i> )

19:41.681 --> 19:42.348
( <i>grunts</i> )

19:42.348 --> 19:43.849
I do.

19:44.550 --> 19:45.918
And do you, Hilda, take Will

19:45.918 --> 19:47.620
to be
your lawfully wedded husband?

19:47.620 --> 19:49.088
Like I'm going
to say, "No," now?

19:49.088 --> 19:50.389
I don't think so.

19:50.389 --> 19:51.624
All right, I do.

19:51.624 --> 19:53.826
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

19:53.826 --> 19:57.596
( <i>stammering</i> ):
You may kiss each other now.

20:00.866 --> 20:01.867
( <i>whooping</i> )

20:01.867 --> 20:04.003
Okay, ladies...
get ready!

20:04.003 --> 20:05.304
Oh! Oh!

20:05.304 --> 20:06.472
Zellie, go long!

20:06.472 --> 20:08.240
Ow! Oh! Ow!

20:09.408 --> 20:10.576
Yeah!

20:10.576 --> 20:11.677
Come here, you.

20:12.278 --> 20:13.279
( <i>gasping happily</i> )

20:13.279 --> 20:14.613
Oh, thanks a lot,
Aunt Zelda.

20:14.613 --> 20:15.614
I broke a heel.

20:15.614 --> 20:17.383
But I got the bouquet!

20:17.383 --> 20:19.151
I'm getting married next!

20:19.151 --> 20:21.487
So, uh, everybody,
start shopping.

20:21.487 --> 20:24.290
I need, um, flatware
and a bagel slicer.

20:24.290 --> 20:25.191
Woo-hoo!

20:25.291 --> 20:26.892
A husband wouldn't hurt.

20:29.895 --> 20:31.964
Oh, the cake's here.

20:31.964 --> 20:33.966
It's... beautiful.

20:33.966 --> 20:35.468
Yes.

20:35.735 --> 20:39.371
I, uh... broke my heel.

20:39.371 --> 20:41.340
Oh. Please, let me fix it.

20:44.844 --> 20:46.178
Wow.

20:46.178 --> 20:49.014
So, who are you and why do I
suddenly feel the urge

20:49.014 --> 20:50.349
to break my other heel?

20:50.349 --> 20:51.350
I'm Luke.

20:51.350 --> 20:53.219
Feel free to break it.

20:54.286 --> 20:57.990
Sabrina, I've got something
to tell you.

20:57.990 --> 20:59.325
I'm still in love with you

20:59.325 --> 21:01.160
but I know
it'll never be returned.

21:01.160 --> 21:02.661
So, I'm moving to California.

21:02.661 --> 21:04.029
What?!

21:04.029 --> 21:06.165
Sabrina, I don't know
what just came over me

21:06.165 --> 21:07.666
but I can't ever
see you again.

21:07.666 --> 21:09.602
I'm taking that newspaper job
in Prague.

21:09.602 --> 21:10.302
What?!

21:10.302 --> 21:11.937
Well, it was nice meeting you.

21:11.937 --> 21:13.639
Guess I'll never see you again.

21:13.639 --> 21:14.473
What?!

21:14.473 --> 21:16.342
ALL THREE:
Good-bye, Sabrina.

21:20.446 --> 21:22.114
"Good-bye"?
