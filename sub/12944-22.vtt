No one is better
at being me than I am.

09:27.734 --> 09:30.166
I've been myself for 13 years.

09:54.667 --> 09:55.700
Who's that kid?

09:55.767 --> 09:57.367
Larry Tudgeman. He's harmless.

09:57.433 --> 09:59.934
Oh. [CHUCKLES] Gordo, what is drama?

10:00.000 --> 10:01.433
-Conflict?
-Good.

10:01.533 --> 10:02.734
Go create it.

10:06.033 --> 10:09.233
So, uh, Tudgeman, how would
you describe yourself?

10:10.000 --> 10:12.233
Uh, I-I've always
thought of myself

10:12.300 --> 10:14.734
as kind of James Bond
meets Captain Kirk sort of guy,

10:14.800 --> 10:16.734
you know,
[IMITATES SEAN CONNERY] boldly going

10:16.800 --> 10:18.867
where no secret agent
has gone before.

10:18.934 --> 10:19.934
Cut!

10:20.367 --> 10:22.767
Gordo, look at that kid.
He's a walking disaster.

10:22.834 --> 10:25.000
Now you got to go after him
like you did that girl.

10:25.066 --> 10:26.300
But he didn't do anything.

10:26.400 --> 10:27.900
-Do you want to be a director?
-Well, yeah.

10:27.967 --> 10:30.166
Well, you can't always
be a nice guy. Conflict.

10:31.266 --> 10:32.667
So, uh, Tudgeman,

10:32.734 --> 10:34.633
how long have you been
wearing this same shirt?

10:34.700 --> 10:35.800
LARRY: Why?

10:35.867 --> 10:38.467
Well, just there's this thing
called "personal hygiene."

10:38.533 --> 10:41.133
I hate to break it to you,
but, Tudgeman, you're a geek.

10:41.333 --> 10:42.934
LARRY: [STUTTERS] Uh, I'm a geek?

10:43.233 --> 10:44.266
No, I'm not!

10:44.333 --> 10:45.934
My mom says
the other kids are mean to me

10:46.000 --> 10:47.900
because they're jealous! Okay?

[GRUNTING]

Great! I couldn't write
anything better.

10:52.867 --> 10:54.166
Let's move on.

10:54.233 --> 10:56.266
Gordo, I think you were
a little harsh on Tudgeman.

10:56.333 --> 10:57.900
I would even go mean.

10:57.967 --> 10:59.700
I was just giving Stan conflict.

10:59.767 --> 11:01.967
Conflict? I think conflict is

11:02.033 --> 11:03.900
when my nail polish
doesn't match my outfit.

11:04.867 --> 11:06.333
So, tell me about your friends.

Well, Lizzie, is there something
you'd like to share about Miranda?

11:49.800 --> 11:52.367
Yeah, actually there is.
In the fourth grade

11:52.433 --> 11:54.633
she used to come home
and snack on doggie biscuits.

11:55.700 --> 11:57.934
[GASPS] Oh, sorry,
it was a mistake.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.834

you were my friend.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.867
Yeah, but I didn't
do it on purpose.

12:02.934 --> 12:04.533
It was a mistake, unlike you.

12:04.600 --> 12:06.533
Yeah, my only mistake
was telling you anything.

12:06.600 --> 12:07.600

12:07.667 --> 12:08.734

out and tell me what's wrong

14:05.166 --> 14:06.500
or do I have to ask you?

would be cool, but it's not

14:16.233 --> 14:17.600
and now Miranda and I are in a fight

secrets to the camera.

14:23.600 --> 14:26.266
but the thing is, Gordo
was the one who started it.

sound like Gordo.

He's being kind of mean
and he was the one

14:36.166 --> 14:37.867
who encouraged us to tell the secrets.

strange things to people.

I have a knack for this.

to be mean to everyone
