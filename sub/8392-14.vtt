THAT WAS SOME HOT BLUES.

00:59.190 --> 01:00.919
- YEAH, YOU CAN PLAY THE HELL
OUT OF THAT THING.

01:01.020 --> 01:02.191
- OH, WELL, THANK YOU.
- THAT WAS COOL.

01:02.300 --> 01:03.779
YOU JUST MADE
THAT THING KIND OF COOL.

01:03.890 --> 01:05.812
I THOUGHT THOSE THINGS ONLY
PLAYED NERD MUSIC.

01:05.920 --> 01:07.160
- YEAH.

01:07.270 --> 01:09.329
I WANNA SEE YOU PLAY THIS LIVE,

01:17.180 --> 01:19.273

01:19.380 --> 01:21.348
I'M PART OF A QUARTET.

01:56.320 --> 01:59.005

02:36.320 --> 02:37.423
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

02:37.530 --> 02:39.077
- I'M WRITING.
I NEED AN INTERRUPTION.

02:39.190 --> 02:40.839
BADLY.
- OH.

02:40.950 --> 02:41.917
- HOW WAS SCHOOL?

02:42.020 --> 02:43.294
- SCHOOL WAS...GOOD.

02:43.400 --> 02:45.743
I GOT AN "A"
ON THAT TEST, SO...

02:45.850 --> 02:47.909
- OH, GOOD, "A" IN CHEMISTRY.
VERY WELL DONE.

02:48.020 --> 02:49.499
YOU WANT ME TO MAKE YOU
SOMETHING?

02:49.610 --> 02:51.089
- UM, WELL, I'M ABOUT TO LEAVE

02:51.200 --> 02:52.883
AND GO TO AMY'S.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.126
- AGAIN?
- I'LL EAT THERE.

02:54.240 --> 02:55.958
YES, AGAIN, I'M SORRY.

02:56.070 --> 02:57.685
- ALL RIGHT.
- ALSO, UM...

02:57.790 --> 03:02.272
AMY'S PARENTS ARE TAKING HER TO
UC DAVIS TO LOOK AT THE SCHOOL,

03:02.380 --> 03:03.620
AND SHE ASKED ME TO GO SO...

03:03.730 --> 03:04.822
- IS THAT A SCHOOL
YOU'RE INTERESTED IN?

03:04.940 --> 03:06.521
- UM, I MEAN--

03:06.630 --> 03:09.076
BECAUSE IF YOU ARE, WE COULD
MAKE A WHOLE THING OUT OF IT

03:09.180 --> 03:11.250
AND DO A TOUR AND--YOU KNOW?
- YEAH.

03:11.360 --> 03:12.975
WELL, YEAH, I MEAN,
BUT I DON'T REALLY KNOW YET.

03:13.080 --> 03:17.460
JUST LOOKING AROUND--IT'S NOT,
LIKE, ANYTHING SERIOUS.

03:17.570 --> 03:18.423
THAT BIG OF A DEAL.
- OH, THAT'S...

03:18.540 --> 03:20.019

03:20.130 --> 03:21.609
YEAH, YOU CAN GO.

03:21.710 --> 03:24.292
ALL RIGHT,
I GUESS I'M OUT OF HERE.

03:24.410 --> 03:25.854

OUR TIME TOGETHER.

03:25.960 --> 03:27.097
- IT WAS REALLY NICE.

03:27.200 --> 03:29.509
- YOU WILL COME HOME AT SOME
POINT THOUGH, RIGHT, BECAUSE--

03:29.620 --> 03:31.963
- I--MAYBE.
- I'D LIKE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

03:32.070 --> 03:33.822
- MMM.

03:33.930 --> 03:35.204
- HEY.

03:35.310 --> 03:36.208
HOW ARE YOU?
- BREAKFAST FOR DINNER?

03:36.310 --> 03:37.242
- I KNOW, I KNOW,
I JUST WANTED TO DO...

03:37.350 --> 03:38.760
- COME ON.
- SOMETHING A LITTLE DIFFERENT.

03:38.870 --> 03:40.269
IT'S ALL I HAD IN THE HOUSE.
- [flatulence]

03:40.390 --> 03:41.550

03:50.260 --> 03:51.181
- WHY--WHAT?

03:51.300 --> 03:52.085
- I JUST HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT

03:52.190 --> 03:54.124
I GOT INTO CORNELL
EARLY ADMISSION.

03:54.230 --> 03:55.879
- YOU DID?
HADDIE, CONGRATULATIONS!

03:55.990 --> 03:56.843
THAT'S FANTASTIC.

03:56.960 --> 03:59.053
- YOU STINKER, I WAS WORRIED.
- THANK YOU.

03:59.160 --> 04:00.331
- WHY IS THERE YELLING?

04:00.440 --> 04:02.499
- YOUR SISTER GOT INTO CORNELL.

04:02.620 --> 04:03.951
- OKAY, WELL,
COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY?

04:04.070 --> 04:05.207
BECAUSE THERE'S A DIFFERENCE.
- UNIVERSITY.

04:05.310 --> 04:07.517
- UNIVERSITY.
- OKAY, WELL IT'S NOT, YOU KNOW,

04:07.620 --> 04:09.895
HARVARD OR YALE
OR PRINCETON OR MIT...

04:10.000 --> 04:11.240
AND CORN ELL--

04:11.350 --> 04:12.749
- SHUT UP!
- CORNELL UNIVERSITY, MAX.

04:12.870 --> 04:14.269
- CORNELL'S NOT BAD.
- GIVE ME A HUG.

04:14.390 --> 04:15.277
I'M SO PROUD, I REALLY AM.

04:15.390 --> 04:16.345
- THANK YOU, THANKS.

04:16.460 --> 04:17.381
- I AM, I KNEW YOU COULD DO IT.

04:17.490 --> 04:19.629
- NORA.
- THAT'S FANTASTIC, HADDIE.

04:19.740 --> 04:21.048
- DID YOU HEAR?
- THANK YOU.

04:21.150 --> 04:22.879
- FANTASTIC.
- YAY!

04:22.980 --> 04:24.208
SISTER GOT INTO CORNELL.

04:24.330 --> 04:26.321
[Whitley's Lost In Time]

04:26.430 --> 04:29.365
- WE'RE COMIN' UP

04:29.470 --> 04:32.769
WE'RE BUILDING SPEED

04:32.890 --> 04:35.950
WE WALK ALONG

04:36.060 --> 04:39.336
THROUGH ENDLESS GREED

04:39.450 --> 04:42.658
WE WALK ALONG

04:42.760 --> 04:45.308
THROUGH ENDLESS NIGHTS

04:45.420 --> 04:51.245
AND SUDDENLY,
IT'S ALL ABOUT TO CHANGE

04:51.360 --> 04:54.249
AND ALL I COULD HAVE BEEN

04:54.360 --> 04:56.112
AND ALL I WOULD HAVE BEEN

04:56.220 --> 04:58.529
- AND BLOOD PRESSURE
LOOKS GOOD,

04:58.640 --> 05:01.086
SO A LOT OF POSITIVES HERE.

05:01.190 --> 05:02.361
- YEAH, ALL RIGHT.

05:02.470 --> 05:06.338
- BUT, THERE IS SOMETHING
WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT, ZEEK.

05:06.440 --> 05:08.328
- WHAT?

05:08.440 --> 05:09.987
- WELL, YOUR TESTS SHOW
THAT YOU HAVE A CONDITION

05:10.100 --> 05:12.819
KNOWN AS
ATRIAL FIBRILLATION.

05:12.930 --> 05:14.648
IT'S A SORT OF
ABNORMAL HEART RHYTHM.

05:14.760 --> 05:19.038
IN FACT, IT'S THE MOST COMMON
ONE AMONGST MEN YOUR AGE.

05:19.140 --> 05:21.176
IT MEANS, THE, UH, UPPER
CHAMBERS OF THE HEART

05:21.280 --> 05:22.690
AREN'T WORKING CORRECT LY,
SO THE BLOOD

05:22.800 --> 05:24.347
ISN'T MOVING THROUGH PROPERLY.

05:24.460 --> 05:25.768
- IT'S SERIOUS?

05:25.870 --> 05:27.553
- NOT IMMEDIATELY
LIFE-THREATENING.

05:27.670 --> 05:30.662
BUT IT CAN CAUSE BLOOD CLOTS.

05:30.770 --> 05:33.182
IT GREATLY INCREASES YOUR
CHANCES OF HAVING A STROKE.

05:33.290 --> 05:35.394
IT CAN ALSO LEAD
TO HEART FAILURE.

05:35.500 --> 05:37.115
- WELL--NO WAIT A SECOND, SEE.

05:37.230 --> 05:38.367
I MEAN, I FEEL GREAT.

05:38.470 --> 05:40.358
I RUN, YOU KNOW,
I TAKE CARE OF MYSELF.

05:40.470 --> 05:42.745
- YOU CAN HAVE A.F.
AND SHOW NO SYMPTOMS.

05:42.850 --> 05:44.169
IT'S NOT UNCOMMON.

05:44.270 --> 05:47.194
- SO, IT'S--IT'S TREATABLE?

05:47.310 --> 05:48.754
- YES.

05:48.860 --> 05:50.589
FOR NOW, I'M GONNA PUT YOU
ON A BLOOD THINNER,

05:50.690 --> 05:54.968
A BETA BLOCKER AND RECOMMEND
A PROGRAM OF DIET AND EXERCISE.

05:55.070 --> 05:59.074
WE'LL FOLLOW UP IN A LITTLE
WHILE AND SEE HOW YOU RESPOND.

05:59.180 --> 06:01.978
IF THE CONDITION
GETS MORE SERIOUS,

06:02.080 --> 06:04.219
THEN WE CAN DISCUSS
SURGICAL OPTIONS THEN.

06:04.320 --> 06:06.072
- SURGERY?

06:06.190 --> 06:09.398
- FOR NOW, WE REALLY
JUST NEED TO MONITOR...

06:09.500 --> 06:10.910
AND SEE HOW IT GOES.

06:11.020 --> 06:13.124
THAT'S A LITTLE WAYS
DOWN THE ROAD.

06:13.230 --> 06:13.980
- OKAY.

06:15.750 --> 06:18.366
MAY GOD BLESS
AND KEEP YOU ALWAYS

06:18.480 --> 06:20.926
AND MAY YOUR WISHES
ALL COME TRUE

06:21.030 --> 06:23.169
MAY YOU ALWAYS DO
FOR OTHERS

06:23.270 --> 06:25.545
AND LET OTHERS DO FOR YOU

06:25.660 --> 06:28.584
MAY YOU BUILD A LADDER
TO THE STARS

06:28.690 --> 06:30.169
AND CLIMB ON EVERY RUNG

06:30.280 --> 06:32.794
AND MAY YOU STAY

06:32.900 --> 06:35.209
FOREVER YOUNG

06:35.320 --> 06:37.732
MAY YOU GROW UP
TO BE RIGHTEOUS

06:37.840 --> 06:40.320
MAY YOU GROW UP
TO BE TRUE

06:40.430 --> 06:42.534
MAY YOU ALWAYS KNOW
THE TRUTH

06:42.640 --> 06:44.915
AND SEE THE LIGHTS
SURROUNDING YOU

06:45.020 --> 06:47.500
MAY YOU ALWAYS BE
COURAGEOUS

06:47.610 --> 06:49.464
STAND UPRIGHT
AND BE STRONG

06:49.580 --> 06:51.605
AND MAY YOU STAY

06:51.720 --> 06:54.234
FOREVER YOUNG

06:54.340 --> 06:56.547
MAY YOU STAY

06:56.650 --> 06:59.995
FOREVER YOUNG

07:10.150 --> 07:12.038
- HEY.
- HEY.

07:13.190 --> 07:15.078
- YOU OKAY?

07:15.190 --> 07:19.320
- JUST CAN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT
THE COST OF TUITION AT CORNELL.

07:19.430 --> 07:22.126
- IT'S LIKE 50, 50--

07:22.230 --> 07:24.152
- CLOSER TO 60.
- 60,000?

07:24.270 --> 07:27.649
- THAT'S JUST ONE YEAR.
COLLEGE IS FOUR YEARS.

07:27.750 --> 07:30.162
- I'VE DONE THE MULTIPLYING
OVER AND OVER IN MY HEAD.

07:30.270 --> 07:34.969
I JUST--YOU KNOW, CORNELL
HAS GREAT FINANCIAL AID.

07:35.070 --> 07:37.937
- THEY'RE GONNA CALCULATE BASED
ON WHAT I WAS EARNING AT T&S,

07:38.040 --> 07:40.622
AND THAT'S ONLY GONNA GET US
TO ABOUT $7,000 A YEAR.

07:40.730 --> 07:42.459
- WHAT ABOUT LOANS?

07:42.560 --> 07:43.595
- I JUST--I DON'T WANT
HADDIE TO BE SADDLED

07:43.700 --> 07:45.008
WITH ALL THIS DEBT
WHEN SHE GETS OUT OF SCHOOL.

07:45.110 --> 07:46.179
- I CAN GET ANOTHER--

07:46.290 --> 07:47.314
- IT'S NOT JUST TUITION,
YOU KNOW?

07:47.430 --> 07:49.148
THERE'S GONNA BE
AIRFARE TO AND FROM.

07:49.260 --> 07:51.660
- I KNOW.
- POCKET MONEY.

07:51.780 --> 07:54.328
- SHE'S GONNA NEED AN ENTIRE
WINTER WARDROBE, TOO.

07:54.430 --> 07:56.466
SHE DOESN'T EVEN OWN MITTENS,
JUST...

08:04.380 --> 08:05.881
- CAREFUL, DON'T STRIP IT.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.513
- HEY, MY HUSBAND'S
A CONTRACTOR.

08:07.620 --> 08:10.066
I KNOW HOW TO DO MY--MY THING
HERE, ALL RIGHT?

08:10.170 --> 08:12.104
- THOSE ARE AWESOME GLASSES.
- YES, SAFETY FIRST.

08:12.210 --> 08:15.099
- YEAH, YOU KNOW YOU REALLY
DON'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THAT

08:15.210 --> 08:17.622
WITH, UH--NO, KEEP ON DOING
WHAT YOU'RE DOING, IT'S--

08:17.730 --> 08:19.618
- HEY, GUYS.
- OKAY, TAKE THIS.

08:19.740 --> 08:21.002
- WAIT--
- SHUT THE DOOR, ALL RIGHT?

08:21.120 --> 08:23.702
- WHY?
- BECAUSE THIS IS FOR THE BABY

08:23.810 --> 08:26.153
THAT SHE'S GIVING UP.
IT MIGHT BE AWKWARD, JUST...

08:26.260 --> 08:27.113
_ OH--

08:28.950 --> 08:31.578
HEY.
- HEY.

08:31.680 --> 08:33.079

08:33.200 --> 08:34.019
GOOD.
- YEAH?

08:34.130 --> 08:35.813
SO...HOW ARE YOU?

08:35.920 --> 08:37.956
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- OH, YOU KNOW, JUST...

08:38.060 --> 08:40.096
GONNA GO LAY DOWN AND THEN PEE
AND THEN LAY DOWN

08:40.200 --> 08:43.135
AND THEN PEE AGAIN
IN TEN SECONDS, SO...

08:43.240 --> 08:44.207
- GREAT.

08:44.310 --> 08:45.993
OH, UM, GOSH, I ALMOST FORGOT.

08:46.110 --> 08:48.340
I ACTUALLY DID SIGN US UP
FOR THAT BIRTHING CLASS--

08:48.450 --> 08:49.587
- WHAT?

08:49.700 --> 08:52.009
YEAH...REMEMBER?

08:52.110 --> 08:55.079

08:55.180 --> 08:56.590
GET MY EPIDURAL ON,

08:56.700 --> 08:57.667
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

08:57.770 --> 08:59.112
SO DO WE REALLY
NEED TO DO THAT?

08:59.220 --> 09:01.848
- YEP, THAT IS COMPLETELY
UNDERSTANDABLE.

09:01.950 --> 09:05.249
BUT IN ORDER TO BIRTH AT THIS
HOSPITAL, WE DO HAVE TO.

09:05.370 --> 09:06.439

09:06.540 --> 09:07.882
AWESOME.

HE'S HOSTING THE FUNDRAISER.

09:13.820 --> 09:15.549
HE'S GOT TONS OF FRIENDS
WITH TONS OF MONEY.

09:15.650 --> 09:16.548
WHY ARE YOU LOOKING
AT ME LIKE THAT?

09:16.650 --> 09:17.582
- DOES THAT NOT CONCERN YOU?

09:17.690 --> 09:19.066
- WHAT?
- WORMELY?

09:19.170 --> 09:19.920
OR IS IT WARMLY?

09:20.040 --> 09:21.416
- HE'S LOADED, I PROMISE YOU.

09:21.520 --> 09:22.373
SO YOU NEED TO BRING THE CHARM.

09:22.490 --> 09:24.549

09:24.660 --> 09:25.968

09:26.080 --> 09:27.559
SORRY TO INTERRUPT.
I'LL COME BACK.

09:27.670 --> 09:28.523
- NO PLEASE, COME IN,
COME ON IN.

09:28.630 --> 09:30.245
- IT'S FINE, I CAN COME BACK.

09:30.360 --> 09:32.385
I JUST WANTED TO GIVE YOU
THE PROOFED COPY OF--

09:32.500 --> 09:33.808
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

09:33.910 --> 09:34.945
THE FUNDRAISER ON SUNDAY.

09:35.050 --> 09:36.085
SOMETHING WRONG?
- NO, NO, NO, NO.

09:36.190 --> 09:36.940
PLEASE DON'T READ IT.

09:37.050 --> 09:38.153
IT'S NOT READY.
- IT'S FINE.

09:38.260 --> 09:39.466
SHE'S REALLY,
REALLY GOOD, I PROMISE.

09:39.570 --> 09:42.334

09:42.440 --> 09:43.532
- THIS IS GREAT.

09:43.650 --> 09:45.129

09:45.230 --> 09:46.401

09:46.510 --> 09:48.649

09:48.760 --> 09:50.307

09:50.410 --> 09:51.616
- YES.
- ARE YOU SURE?

09:51.720 --> 09:53.096
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I WILL DO THERE.

09:53.210 --> 09:54.370
- I KNOW I--
- I DON'T THINK SO.

09:54.490 --> 09:55.752
- YOU SEE,
IT'S NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE

09:55.870 --> 09:56.723
TO NOT MAKE FUN OF THAT NAME.
- IT'S FUNNY.

09:56.830 --> 09:57.933
[laughs]
- YOU'RE GONNA GO.

09:58.040 --> 09:59.075
IT'LL BE FUN.

09:59.180 --> 10:00.454
- I DON'T, UH--

10:00.560 --> 10:01.788

10:01.910 --> 10:02.934
- WHY AM I GOING?
- OKAY.

10:09.710 --> 10:10.734
- HEY.

10:10.850 --> 10:11.987
I JUST GOT BACK

10:12.090 --> 10:13.489
I PICKED UP YOUR PRESCRIPTIONS,

10:13.610 --> 10:15.464
AND I GOT YOU
A LITTLE PILLBOX HERE

10:15.580 --> 10:17.502
THAT HAS ALL THE DAYS
OF THE WEEK ON IT

10:17.610 --> 10:19.362
SO YOU WON'T EVEN HAVE
TO THINK ABOUT IT.

10:19.480 --> 10:23.029
I ALSO FOUND THESE, UH, GOOD
HEART-HEALTHY RECIPES

10:23.130 --> 10:24.540

10:27.970 --> 10:29.039
- HEY, YOU KNOW--YOU KNOW WHAT?

10:29.140 --> 10:31.108
- BECAUSE THERE MAY BE POSSIBLE
SIDE EFFECTS.

10:31.210 --> 10:32.416
- YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN THINKING,
I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD

10:32.520 --> 10:33.760
TELL THE KIDS RIGHT NOW.

10:33.870 --> 10:35.724
I WANNA JUST HOLD OFF ON IT.

10:35.840 --> 10:37.865
I GOTTA GET MY HEAD AROUND IT.

THAT HAS TO BE DONE
FOR TOMORROW.

11:01.660 --> 11:02.968
- OKAY.

11:03.070 --> 11:04.992
- HEY, UM, DO YOU
REMEMBER THE GIRL

11:05.110 --> 11:07.999
YOU MET AT THE STUDIO
THE OTHER NIGHT, LILY?

11:08.110 --> 11:10.692
- LILY?
YEAH, THE CELLIST?

11:10.800 --> 11:11.789
- YEAH, THE CELLIST.

11:11.910 --> 11:14.310

11:14.430 --> 11:15.874

11:15.980 --> 11:16.901
WHAT'S THAT SMIRK ABOUT?

11:19.330 --> 11:22.436
I, UH, SAW YOU GUYS KISS.

11:23.610 --> 11:25.123

YOU SAW US KISS?

11:25.230 --> 11:26.709
YOU WERE CREEPING
AROUND THE HALLWAY?

11:26.820 --> 11:28.856
- NO, I JUST--I...
I MEAN, IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

11:28.960 --> 11:30.097
IT'S JUST THAT JABBAR
WAS THERE.

11:30.200 --> 11:33.135
- JABBAR SAW, TOO?
- NO, THAT'S BECAUSE

11:33.240 --> 11:35.754
I GOT TO THE DOOR FIRST
AND WHEN I SAW YOU WERE BUSY,

11:35.860 --> 11:38.306
I, UM, RAN INTERFERENCE.

11:38.420 --> 11:40.308
- HMM.

11:40.420 --> 11:41.341
AW, THANK YOU.

11:41.450 --> 11:43.077
I--I DIDN'T REALIZE WE WERE

11:43.180 --> 11:44.977
BEING WATCHED;
THAT'S EM BARRASSING.

11:45.080 --> 11:47.219
- LOOK, I KNOW YOU'RE
GONNA HAVE HOOK UPS,

11:47.320 --> 11:48.287
AND I'M NOT SAYING DON'T.

11:48.390 --> 11:50.119
JUST WHEN YOU KNOW
YOUR SON'S ON HIS WAY--

11:50.220 --> 11:51.972
- FOR THE RECORD,
IT'S NOT A--A HOOK UP.

11:52.090 --> 11:54.979
I ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW,
I LIKE THIS GIRL.

11:55.090 --> 11:56.159
- OH, OKAY.

11:56.260 --> 11:59.013
AND SHE'S, UM
A REALLY GREAT MUSICIAN.

11:59.130 --> 12:00.461
AND THAT'S WHY 1--
WHY I BROUGHT HER UP,

12:00.580 --> 12:02.912
BECAUSE I WAS GONNA ASK YOU
IF I COULD TAKE JABBAR

12:03.030 --> 12:04.918

IN THIS CONCERT.

12:05.030 --> 12:06.099
- WHAT--WHAT CONCERT?

12:06.200 --> 12:07.997

AT GOLDEN GATE PARK.

12:08.100 --> 12:08.919
IT'S SUPPOSED
TO BE REALLY COOL.

12:09.030 --> 12:10.372
- OH, THE W.C. SERIES.

12:10.480 --> 12:11.754
- YEAH.

12:11.860 --> 12:13.964
I CAN'T BELIEVE LILY
IS PERFORMING IN THAT.

12:14.070 --> 12:15.241
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE AMAZING.
- YEAH.

12:15.350 --> 12:18.695
- WELL, I WAS ACTUALLY THINKING
ABOUT GETTING TICKETS

12:18.800 --> 12:19.789

UNLESS THAT'S WEIRD FOR YOU.

12:27.400 --> 12:28.321
I MEAN, IS THAT WEIRD?

12:28.430 --> 12:29.943
- NO, I'LL, UM,
YEAH, I'LL ASK HER.

12:30.050 --> 12:30.982
- GOOD.
- YEAH.

12:31.090 --> 12:32.534
UM, I'LL GET THE TICKETS.

12:32.640 --> 12:33.572
- JUST MAKING SURE, YOU KNOW.

12:33.680 --> 12:34.578
I WANT YOU TO BE COMFORTABLE.
- RIGHT.

12:34.680 --> 12:36.261
- THIS WILL BE, UH--

12:36.370 --> 12:37.120

12:45.280 --> 12:46.508
- WELL, THIS IS A GOOD WAY
TO GET OUT ANGER.

12:46.620 --> 12:49.748
- IT JUST MAKES ME MORE ANGRY,
THOUGH, THAT I'M NOT STRONG.

12:49.870 --> 12:50.962
- WELL, YOU KNOW,
ICE CREAM THERAPY'S

12:51.080 --> 12:52.035

- THANKS.

13:17.410 --> 13:18.820
- BECAUSE I KNOW, YOU KNOW,
HOW YOU GET WITHOUT YOUR PHONE.

13:18.930 --> 13:20.682
SO, I WAS JUST IN
THE NEIGHBORHOOD--

13:20.800 --> 13:22.108
- OH, WAIT, STOP, STOP, STOP,

13:43.610 --> 13:45.339
WHERE WE WOULD EAT EVERY DAY.

13:45.440 --> 13:46.338
both: EL COYOTE.

13:46.440 --> 13:47.259
- YES.

13:47.370 --> 13:49.235

13:49.340 --> 13:51.444
THE BEST MARGARITAS.
IT'S AMAZING.

13:51.550 --> 13:53.518
- OH, WITH A LITTLE BIT OF
THE SALT ON TOP, IT'S SO GOOD.

13:53.620 --> 13:54.279

THERE'S NO EXCUSE.
- OH, GOD, I MEAN...

14:03.770 --> 14:05.351
IT'S WORTH THE TRIP, REALLY.

14:05.460 --> 14:07.803
- YOU MEAN A SHORT TRIP.
- I'D LOVE TO SEE THE SCHOOL.

14:07.910 --> 14:09.878
THAT WOULD BE GREAT.
I'M EXCITED.

14:09.980 --> 14:11.971
IT'S THE BEGINNING
OF OUR COLLEGE TOUR, YOU KNOW.

14:14.020 --> 14:15.157
[knocks at door]

14:15.260 --> 14:16.158

14:18.510 --> 14:19.226

- HEY.

14:19.340 --> 14:21.479
- I'M LOOKING AT THE CAMPUS.

14:21.580 --> 14:24.572
IT'S REALLY PRETTY,
AND THERE'S A MUSEUM AND STUFF,

14:24.690 --> 14:26.021
AND I THINK IT'S GONNA BE COOL.

14:26.140 --> 14:27.471
- THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.

14:27.590 --> 14:29.137
- IT JUST LOOKS, LIKE, EXCITING
AND IT'S FUN TO LOOK AT.

14:29.240 --> 14:30.684

- THAT'S GREAT.

14:30.800 --> 14:32.244
- IT'S SO PRETTY.
- SO...YEAH.

14:32.350 --> 14:34.238
- THAT'S VERY COOL.
- YEAH.

14:34.350 --> 14:37.217
- LISTEN, HADDIE, YOUR MOTHER
AND I, WE COULDN'T BE PROUDER.

14:37.320 --> 14:41.188
GETTING INTO AN IW LEAGUE
SCHOOL IS A GREAT ACHIEVEMENT

14:41.290 --> 14:43.326
AND, UH...
- IT'S A REMARKABLE ACHIEVEMENT.

14:43.430 --> 14:44.943
- I'VE DREAMT THAT FOR YOU
SINCE YOU WERE A LITTLE KID.

14:45.050 --> 14:46.358
- MM-HMM.
- 'KAY.

14:46.470 --> 14:51.157
- BUT WE WANTED TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT KEEPING YOUR OPTIONS OPEN.

14:51.260 --> 14:53.148
- MM-HMM.
- JUST TO HAVE A BACKUP.

14:53.270 --> 14:55.022
- AS YOU KNOW,
IT'S BEEN A TOUGH YEAR

14:55.130 --> 14:57.473
WITH ME LOSING
MY JOB AT T&S, AND--

14:57.580 --> 14:59.195
- FINANCIALLY,
IT'S BEEN A ROLLERCOASTER.

14:59.310 --> 15:00.891
- IT HIT OUR SAVINGS
PRETTY HARD,

15:01.000 --> 15:02.024
AND THEN GOING
INTO BUSINESS WITH

15:02.140 --> 15:03.038
UNCLE CROSBY
PRETTY MUCH WIPED OUT

15:03.140 --> 15:04.300
OUR SAVINGS.
- MAX'S EXPENSES, YOU KNOW,

15:04.420 --> 15:06.729
FOR DR. PELIKAN ALONE
ARE COLOSSAL.

15:06.830 --> 15:08.274
- COLOSSAL.
SOCIAL SKILLS GROUP AND--

15:08.390 --> 15:10.244
- TUTORING ALL THE--
- NORA.

15:10.350 --> 15:11.339
- MM-HMM...SURE.

15:11.460 --> 15:14.042
- AND EVEN THOUGH BOTH YOUR
MOTHER AND I ARE WORKING,

15:14.150 --> 15:15.902
OUR COMBINED INCOME
ISN'T NEARLY AS MUCH MONEY

15:16.010 --> 15:18.217
AS WHEN I WAS WORKING
AT T&S, SO...

15:18.330 --> 15:19.661
WE JUST WANT YOU TO KEEP
YOUR OPTIONS OPEN.

15:19.780 --> 15:21.008
MAYBE THINK ABOUT BERKLEY.
IT'S A GREAT SCHOOL.

15:21.120 --> 15:22.189
YOU COULD LIVE AT HOME.

15:22.300 --> 15:23.460
WHEN YOU GOT OUT
OF SCHOOL,

15:23.570 --> 15:25.219
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE
A HUGE MOUNTAIN OF DEBT.

15:25.330 --> 15:28.675
- OH, THE STUDENT LOANS ALONE
WOULD BE...

15:28.780 --> 15:30.122
- MM-HMM.

15:30.230 --> 15:33.370
YEAH, OKAY, SO, UH...

15:33.480 --> 15:35.892
YEAH, IT'S NICE THAT
I GOT IN IN THE FIRST PLACE,

15:36.000 --> 15:37.308
SO Y--I DON'T HAVE TO GO.

15:37.410 --> 15:40.129
- JUST KEEP OPTIONS OPEN UNTIL
WE FIGURE OUT WHAT WE CAN DO.

15:40.240 --> 15:41.684
OKAY?
- ALL RIGHT.

BUT, YOU KNOW,
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME

25:17.440 --> 25:19.237
YOU WERE, LIKE--IS IT BECAUSE--

25:19.340 --> 25:21.513

25:31.350 --> 25:35.480
FROM SOMEBODY WHO FINISHED

25:53.550 --> 25:56.542
I DON'T CARE IF WE HAVE TO BEG,
BORROW, OR STEAL TO DO THIS.

25:56.650 --> 25:57.514
OKAY, IT'S NOT FAIR TO HER.

25:57.620 --> 25:58.712
SHE DESERVES THIS.

25:58.830 --> 26:00.274
SHE'S WORKED SO HARD.

26:00.380 --> 26:03.372
IN HIGH SCHOOL SHE MAINTAINED
A 4.1 GPA THE ENTIRE TIME.

26:11.010 --> 26:12.045
BERKELEY IS NOT HER DREAM
SCHOOL.

26:12.150 --> 26:13.378
- I KNOW IT'S NOT
HER DREAM SCHOOL.

26:13.500 --> 26:14.353
I'M SORRY SHE'S GONNA BE
DISAPPOINTED,

26:14.460 --> 26:15.427
BUT SHE CAN GET OUT OF SCHOOL

26:15.530 --> 26:16.428
WITHOUT ANY DEBT, SHE CAN HAVE A

26:16.540 --> 26:17.871
PART-TIME JOB.
- THIS IS KILLING ME.

26:22.680 --> 26:23.715
- DOESN'T MAKE GOOD SENSE.

26:26.960 --> 26:28.780
- OKAY.

26:28.890 --> 26:30.755
THEN WE NEED TO TELL HER.

26:30.860 --> 26:33.613
WE HAVE TO BE HONEST WITH HER
AND TELL HER SHE CAN'T GO.

26:38.110 --> 26:39.828

NO MATTER WHAT.

26:56.850 --> 27:01.025
HE DOESN'T REALLY WANNA TELL ME
ABOUT HIS RELATIONSHIP

27:01.130 --> 27:07.683
OR ABOUT HIS PLANS OR REALLY
ABOUT MUCH OF ANYTHING.

27:07.790 --> 27:09.963
HE'S PULLING AWAY FROM ME.
- MM-HMM.

27:10.070 --> 27:12.584
WELL, THAT'S WHAT
THEY DO, YOU KNOW?

27:12.700 --> 27:14.622
THAT'S WHAT THEY DO.

27:18.460 --> 27:19.358

34:31.030 --> 34:32.577
OKAY, IT'S GONNA BE TOUGH ON
EVERYBODY.

34:32.690 --> 34:33.714
- OKAY.

34:33.830 --> 34:35.786

GET A JOB.

34:54.740 --> 34:55.877
OKAY.

34:55.990 --> 34:57.560
LET'S START WITH THE BAD NEWS.

34:57.680 --> 34:59.671
CHILDBIRTH IS PAINFUL.

34:59.780 --> 35:01.600
THERE'S NO POINT IN
SUGAR-COATING IT.

35:01.720 --> 35:03.676
YOU'VE ALL HEARD IT,
AND IT'S TRUE.

35:03.790 --> 35:05.712
IT HURTS A LOT.

35:07.130 --> 35:10.202
BUT, WHAT'S ALSO TRUE IS THIS...

35:11.690 --> 35:14.170
THE GREATEST JOY YOU'LL EVER
FEEL IN YOUR LIFE

35:14.280 --> 35:17.488
IS THE FIRST TIME YOU HOLD
YOUR BABY IN YOUR ARMS.

35:17.590 --> 35:20.172
I MEAN IT.

35:20.290 --> 35:22.804
IT'S MAGIC.

35:22.910 --> 35:26.323
ARE YOU EXHAUSTED IN A WAY YOU
NEVER THOUGHT POSSIBLE?

35:26.430 --> 35:27.590
YES.

35:27.710 --> 35:29.632
BUT TRUST ME.

35:29.740 --> 35:32.493
WHEN YOU HOLD THAT BABY,
IT WON'T MATTER.

35:32.610 --> 35:35.909
EVERYTHING WILL BE PERFECT
IN THAT MOMENT.

35:36.030 --> 35:38.715
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT, EXCUSE ME.

35:38.820 --> 35:41.163
EXCUSE ME.

35:46.660 --> 35:47.649
- SORRY.

35:47.760 --> 35:48.920
UM, PARDON ME.

35:55.730 --> 35:56.901
HEY.

SORRY.

36:00.330 --> 36:02.594
- NO, I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.

36:02.710 --> 36:04.632
I DIDN'T REALLY...

36:04.740 --> 36:07.504
THINK ABOUT, UM, WHAT
IT WAS GONNA BE LIKE.

36:07.610 --> 36:09.191
AND IF I HAD, I WOULDN'T HAVE...

36:09.300 --> 36:12.815
MADE US COME, SO...

36:12.920 --> 36:13.852

- OKAY.

36:17.340 --> 36:20.343
- JUST HURTS.

36:20.450 --> 36:23.487
IT HURTS MORE THAN I THOUGHT IT
WAS GONNA HURT.

36:27.010 --> 36:28.864
BUT IT IS WHAT IT IS, RIGHT?

36:31.980 --> 36:33.971
I DON'T WANT YOU TO WORRY ABOUT
THIS, OKAY?

36:51.690 --> 36:52.679
- I FEEL LIKE I'M DRUNK, I'M
TELLING YOU WHAT.

36:52.790 --> 36:53.779
both: I'M SO TIRED.

36:53.900 --> 36:55.413
[both laugh]

36:55.520 --> 36:57.408

37:14.570 --> 37:16.083

38:38.860 --> 38:41.932
AND HE PUTS A GRENADE IN MY LAP
AND SAYS "HERE, THERE YOU GO.

38:42.040 --> 38:44.315
THERE'S THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.
HOW ABOUT THAT?"

38:44.420 --> 38:45.489

39:07.930 --> 39:09.443
COMMON FOR MEN YOUR AGE.
