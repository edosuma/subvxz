00:00.626 --> 00:02.617
<i>Previously on</i>
Beauty & the Beast...

00:02.876 --> 00:05.811
I was hoping that we
could, you know, talk.

00:05.879 --> 00:06.482
About...?

00:06.507 --> 00:08.579
About why you've been hiding
the truth from me...

00:08.681 --> 00:10.448
Dad.

00:10.516 --> 00:12.284
Vincent only has
two missions left.

00:12.351 --> 00:14.552
And that's not a good thing?
No. It's a bad thing.

00:14.620 --> 00:17.055
The last mission could
very well be Vincent.

00:17.123 --> 00:18.556
Target's name is Curt Windsor.

00:18.624 --> 00:20.625
He volunteered
for the first experiments.

00:20.693 --> 00:22.161
But he's only been getting
more paranoid

00:22.228 --> 00:23.395
since his ex-wife died--

00:23.462 --> 00:24.996
especially about
his daughter Tori.

00:25.063 --> 00:26.731
Tori!
Daddy?

00:30.603 --> 00:32.503
Please, no...

00:32.570 --> 00:34.172
And I'm giving you
exactly two minutes

00:34.239 --> 00:35.807
to decide what's
more important to you--

00:35.874 --> 00:37.676
<i>your daughter</i>
<i>or staying a beast?</i>

00:37.743 --> 00:38.903
How would that work, exactly?

00:38.911 --> 00:40.044
You'd have to die.

01:10.308 --> 01:11.742
Cooked and ready.

01:11.810 --> 01:13.109
It's not a turkey.

01:13.177 --> 01:14.911
Well, you're full of
Thanksgiving cheer.

01:14.979 --> 01:17.047
The threat of exposure
doesn't exactly

01:17.114 --> 01:18.915
bring out my cheery side.

01:18.983 --> 01:22.585
But I will be filled with
gratitude once he's dead.

01:24.956 --> 01:28.691
♪ Can't you see
that it's pouring down ♪

01:28.759 --> 01:32.395
♪ All told...

01:32.463 --> 01:33.696
My heart is racing.

01:33.764 --> 01:36.131
Mine too.

01:36.199 --> 01:39.469
♪ It can start
with their words... ♪

01:39.536 --> 01:42.372
Except I can't rip yours
out of your chest.

01:44.441 --> 01:48.143
I'm sorry, I'm sorry I can't
get the image out of my head.

01:48.211 --> 01:50.880
You-you had Windsor's
heart in your hand.

01:50.947 --> 01:53.082
It was still beating.

01:53.149 --> 01:55.117
He was about
to kill his daughter.

01:55.185 --> 01:57.953
Yes, I know, he was
a vicious beast,

01:58.021 --> 02:00.622
but you... you were
just as vicious.

02:03.126 --> 02:06.461
You're not losing me
to that other side of myself.

02:06.529 --> 02:08.295
Look, I just... I gotta
finish this list--

02:08.364 --> 02:12.333
one more mission, then these
beast killings are over, done.

02:12.402 --> 02:14.102
And you trust your handler?

02:14.169 --> 02:15.470
Yes.

02:15.538 --> 02:16.938
Because if he or she

02:17.006 --> 02:18.774
has you saving the world

02:18.841 --> 02:20.641
by killing
out-of-control beasts,

02:20.709 --> 02:22.911
and you are
just as out-of-control...

02:22.978 --> 02:24.812
No, I am different.

02:24.880 --> 02:26.781
Catherine, I've been
thinking about this, okay?

02:26.848 --> 02:29.483
Maybe this loss of control,

02:29.551 --> 02:33.654
it's just a reaction to all
the other assassinations.

02:33.722 --> 02:35.689
You know, when an officer
kills on duty,

02:35.757 --> 02:38.025
they're given a mandatory
leave of absence, right?

02:38.092 --> 02:39.159
So they don't...

02:39.227 --> 02:40.928
Rip people's organs out?

02:42.898 --> 02:45.265
That might be work.

02:46.668 --> 02:48.268
Hi.

02:48.336 --> 02:49.637
Catherine, it's Bob.

02:49.704 --> 02:51.305
Am I catching you in the middle?

02:51.372 --> 02:53.106
No, um... what's up?

02:53.174 --> 02:55.309
You probably already have plans,

02:55.376 --> 02:57.210
but I was, uh... I was hoping

02:57.278 --> 02:58.946
we might have
Thanksgiving together.

02:59.013 --> 03:00.680
Thanksgiving.

03:00.748 --> 03:03.283
Um... you know,
I didn't realize

03:03.351 --> 03:04.952
that it was the end of
November already.

03:05.019 --> 03:06.486
I've been so
caught up with work.

03:06.554 --> 03:07.821
Well, of course,
you've had a crazy year,

03:07.888 --> 03:09.622
which is why I thought
it might be nice

03:09.690 --> 03:12.291
if you'd to come to my house in Montauk.
Montauk?

03:12.359 --> 03:14.861
And since I'm leaving the
country after the holiday...

03:14.929 --> 03:16.796
Can you hold on a second?

03:16.864 --> 03:18.865
You want to go to Montauk.

03:18.933 --> 03:21.400
No, I just wish that we--

03:21.469 --> 03:23.829
Lived in an alternate universe,
and I could meet the parent?

03:23.871 --> 03:25.371
He's not my "parent"--

03:25.439 --> 03:27.373
He was the lead investigator
on the Windsor case.

03:27.441 --> 03:30.709
Even if I did feel fine--

03:30.777 --> 03:32.144
You said you were fine.

03:32.212 --> 03:35.348
He's FBI, I'm an assassin.

03:35.415 --> 03:38.717
Okay-- perfectly fine,
in-control assassin,

03:38.785 --> 03:42.554
but, look, if you want to go,
go-- just go, go without me.

03:44.624 --> 03:47.325
Hey, Bob, I just had to check
with my boyfriend.

03:47.393 --> 03:50.161
It actually turns out that he
made plans already for us, so...

03:50.229 --> 03:52.330
Probably a little early
to meet the boyfriend.

03:52.398 --> 03:54.265
Probably.

03:54.333 --> 03:55.367
Well, if anything changes
for you,

03:55.434 --> 03:56.935
the invitation still stands.

03:57.003 --> 03:58.770
I am family.

03:58.838 --> 03:59.904
At least, I'd like to be.

03:59.972 --> 04:01.172
Thank you. Happy travels.

04:03.409 --> 04:06.744
You know I am making plans...

04:06.812 --> 04:08.413
for Thanksgiving.

04:08.481 --> 04:11.582
With everything that's
going on with me, and you,

04:11.650 --> 04:13.451
You know what I mean?
It's the first year

04:13.519 --> 04:17.120
without your actual
father-- I get it.

04:17.188 --> 04:20.524
I understand why you would be
tempted to go to Montauk.

04:22.027 --> 04:24.795
So, who's cooking this feast?

04:24.863 --> 04:27.097
I make some
good mashed potatoes.

04:27.165 --> 04:28.966
Really?
Mm-mm.

04:29.034 --> 04:30.535
But I could follow a recipe...

04:30.602 --> 04:32.469
Hmm...
give you some new images

04:32.537 --> 04:36.940
to focus on, of me
cooking, chopping...

04:37.008 --> 04:39.076
Okay, maybe, maybe
not chopping.

04:39.144 --> 04:42.046
Maybe me kissing you?

04:42.113 --> 04:43.747
Well, we've got a meal to make

04:43.814 --> 04:45.982
and I'm gonna pull out
the cookbooks.

04:55.059 --> 04:57.561
Looks like the holiday section
threw up on you.

04:57.628 --> 04:59.495
I know you hate Thanksgiving,

04:59.564 --> 05:00.645
but Vincent and I
are having

05:00.665 --> 05:01.765
a good old-fashioned
celebration.

05:01.832 --> 05:03.466
Old-fashioned? Really?

05:03.534 --> 05:05.935
With, uh, plastic hay

05:06.002 --> 05:08.003
and pumpkin-flavored
coffee beans?

05:08.072 --> 05:09.838
The spirit is old-fashioned.

05:09.906 --> 05:12.308
We're focusing on all we
have to be grateful for.

05:12.376 --> 05:14.410
It's his last mission, so...

05:16.080 --> 05:17.080
What?

05:17.147 --> 05:18.508
Gabe didn't want me
to say anything

05:18.549 --> 05:20.583
until he had proof but

05:20.650 --> 05:23.251
he thinks his handler's setting
some kind of trap for him.

05:23.319 --> 05:24.519
What?

05:24.588 --> 05:26.989
That Vincent is the
last target on his list.

05:27.057 --> 05:30.125
Okay, I already talked
to Vincent about this.

05:30.193 --> 05:32.427
He... he said that
he trusts him.

05:34.764 --> 05:37.332
Besides, Vincent is different
from the others.

05:37.400 --> 05:40.535
Really? Because this looks like
overcompensating to me.

05:40.603 --> 05:43.171
Cat, Gabe told me that
Vincent ripped Windsor's

05:43.239 --> 05:44.839
beating heart
out of his chest.

05:46.109 --> 05:47.275
I knew it.

05:47.343 --> 05:48.810
Where you going?

05:48.877 --> 05:50.845
Cat, I wasn't
supposed to tell you...

05:50.913 --> 05:52.514
Tori, I know what you saw
happen to your father

05:52.582 --> 05:53.982
must have been shocking.

05:54.049 --> 05:55.683
What, the fact that he
was literally a monster,

05:55.751 --> 05:56.851
or that another monster
killed him?

05:56.919 --> 05:59.286
Vincent did that
to save your life.

05:59.354 --> 06:01.288
Look, I brought you
here because

06:01.356 --> 06:04.358
it is vital we keep this
between me, you

06:04.426 --> 06:06.193
Detectives Chandler
and Vargas.

06:06.261 --> 06:07.996
I'm not gonna tweet
about it, okay?

06:08.063 --> 06:09.396
I just want to understand

06:09.464 --> 06:10.732
that thing that you
were gonna do--

06:10.799 --> 06:12.966
"de-monsterify" my dad?

06:13.034 --> 06:14.168
Flatline him?

06:14.236 --> 06:15.836
Were you just
gonna revive him

06:15.903 --> 06:17.971
with regular paddles,
like they do in the hospital?

06:18.039 --> 06:20.641
Yeah, but--
You don't need anything special?

06:20.708 --> 06:23.344
Tori, are you thinking
you could've flatlined him?

06:23.411 --> 06:25.312
Tell me what you know about
Vincent's handler trying to kill him.

06:25.380 --> 06:27.515
I had to tell her he's
got one more mission.

06:27.582 --> 06:28.148
Detectives!

06:30.084 --> 06:31.018
Tori.

06:31.085 --> 06:32.085
Hi.

06:32.153 --> 06:33.186
I was just explaining

06:33.254 --> 06:34.187
how we all need to be careful

06:34.255 --> 06:35.555
what we say in front of people.

06:35.623 --> 06:37.390
That was just, uh,
just an expression.

06:37.458 --> 06:40.593
Yeah, you know, like, I kill Cat
at... headstands, you know?

06:40.662 --> 06:41.995
Look, you didn't
answer my question

06:42.063 --> 06:43.096
about the flatlining--

06:43.164 --> 06:45.865
has it ever worked?
Just once.

06:45.932 --> 06:47.867
Tori is in that understandable
place of "what if's."

06:47.934 --> 06:49.202
Out of how many times?

06:49.270 --> 06:50.503
Two.

06:50.571 --> 06:52.272
So the odds are 50-50--
not very good.

06:52.339 --> 06:53.906
There's nothing
you could've done.

06:53.974 --> 06:56.242
Call me anytime.

06:56.310 --> 06:58.390
He's usually very communicative,
it's like his motto.

07:01.982 --> 07:03.515
I just didn't want you
to worry until I--

07:03.583 --> 07:05.718
Had proof, I know.
But I have been worried--

07:05.786 --> 07:07.352
Yeah, she's been buying
bad holiday decor--

07:07.420 --> 07:09.621
Just show me what you have.
Well, it's not proof

07:09.690 --> 07:11.557
someone's trying to kill him.
I've just been working on

07:11.624 --> 07:12.958
I.D.'ing
who his handler is.

07:13.026 --> 07:14.293
And...?

07:16.963 --> 07:18.930
It's not here.

07:18.998 --> 07:21.433
What isn't?
Muirfield's files.

07:21.501 --> 07:23.902
We retrieved them after
we blew up their headquarters.

07:23.969 --> 07:25.770
I was just about to go through
their payroll,

07:25.838 --> 07:28.073
run names, see if anyone's
still alive.

07:28.140 --> 07:29.808
You think the handler's
from Muirfield?

07:29.875 --> 07:32.411
Muirfield wiped my computer
when I was getting close.

07:32.478 --> 07:34.445
Whoever it is must think
you're onto something.

07:34.513 --> 07:36.414
Where's Vincent?

07:48.160 --> 07:49.094
Sir, I think I've been given

07:49.161 --> 07:50.228
the wrong coordinates.

07:50.295 --> 07:51.629
There's no one in the warehouse.

07:51.697 --> 07:54.565
Well, our intel says otherwise.
Move ahead.

07:54.633 --> 07:56.500
Sir, I don't sense a target.

07:56.568 --> 07:57.968
Listen to me, soldier.

07:58.036 --> 07:59.970
Your job is to carry out orders.

08:00.038 --> 08:02.072
You failed with Windsor.

08:02.140 --> 08:03.774
You put our entire operation

08:03.842 --> 08:06.944
at risk of exposure
with your... zeal.

08:08.346 --> 08:11.081
It was a momentary
loss of control.

08:11.149 --> 08:14.752
Condor, I'm ordering you
to move ahead.

08:43.780 --> 08:45.181
Condor?

08:52.722 --> 08:53.856

09:10.176 --> 09:11.409
He's not picking up.

09:11.476 --> 09:14.077
It looks like Vincent was sent numbers.
Numbers?

09:14.078 --> 09:17.014
42, seven, one,
N, 73, six, nine.

09:17.081 --> 09:18.515
They're coordinates,
like a compass.

09:18.582 --> 09:19.616
I was a Cub Scout.

09:19.684 --> 09:20.851
You're a girl.

09:20.919 --> 09:22.886
Coordinates to where?
Uh...

09:24.488 --> 09:25.923
Location in Troy, New York.

09:25.990 --> 09:28.057
- Troy?
- Get closer.

09:28.125 --> 09:30.205
What now?
I get blotter alerts from around the state.

09:30.260 --> 09:32.195
There was just--
An explosion at a warehouse in Troy.

09:32.262 --> 09:33.763
We've gotta get there.

09:33.831 --> 09:34.864
Catherine, we don't know
that's where Vincent is.

09:34.932 --> 09:36.032
Oh, right,
we don't have proof?

09:36.099 --> 09:37.133
I'm sorry,
I didn't want you to worry.

09:37.201 --> 09:38.768
Now I'm way past worried!

09:38.836 --> 09:41.204
You had a theory-- you knew
that he was getting worse,

09:41.271 --> 09:42.872
you even gossiped
to Tess about it.

09:42.940 --> 09:44.807
Wasn't that proof enough,
that he mauled that guy?

09:44.875 --> 09:46.809
Of course his handler's
trying to kill him.

09:46.877 --> 09:48.211
He's totally out of control.

09:49.880 --> 09:51.647
Oh, my God.
Are you okay?

09:51.715 --> 09:52.614
Vincent.

09:52.682 --> 09:53.749
I am. Are you?

09:53.817 --> 09:54.817
Yeah, I was just...

09:54.885 --> 09:56.452
Momentary loss of control?

09:56.519 --> 09:58.454
Totally.
You-you-you know her.

09:58.521 --> 09:59.722
She rambles when
she's nervous.

09:59.789 --> 10:00.656
We were just worried that

10:00.724 --> 10:01.657
something happened to you.

10:01.725 --> 10:03.258
There was an explosion
in Troy.

10:03.326 --> 10:05.594
How did you know?

10:05.662 --> 10:07.062
This morning, someone stole
a Muirfield file

10:07.129 --> 10:08.630
off one of our computers.

10:08.698 --> 10:10.466
We are trying to figure out
who your handler is.

10:10.533 --> 10:12.334
We had a theory--
I thought you understood

10:12.402 --> 10:14.002
what I do is
completely covert.

10:14.070 --> 10:16.637
And now you're
investigating my handler?

10:16.705 --> 10:19.440
You really think this happened
'cause I'm out of control?

10:19.508 --> 10:20.909
If there was a security
breach,

10:20.977 --> 10:23.078
and he tracked it back to y...

10:23.145 --> 10:24.946
No I wonder he
just tried to kill me.

10:25.014 --> 10:27.515
Look, it wasn't Catherine;
I was the one investigating.

10:27.583 --> 10:29.017
Okay, okay.

10:29.085 --> 10:30.651
I'm not usually
the voice of calm,

10:30.719 --> 10:32.487
but considering your handler
did just try to kill you,

10:32.554 --> 10:34.955
maybe you should stop
pointing fingers

10:35.023 --> 10:37.425
and focus on finding him
before he finds us.

10:37.493 --> 10:38.569
That is a great idea.

10:38.594 --> 10:40.995
Look, maybe there's something
you can tell us about him.

10:40.996 --> 10:43.197
- There's not much to tell.
- You don't need to protect him.

10:43.265 --> 10:45.266
He tried to kill you.
I'm not, we only communicate

10:45.333 --> 10:46.801
via e-mail or phone.

10:46.869 --> 10:48.870
Do you have a name?
No.

10:48.937 --> 10:50.871
Haven't even heard
his real voice.

10:50.939 --> 10:52.839
Sorry, the office.
Uh, Vincent,

10:52.908 --> 10:55.876
does this mystery handler person
know you're still alive?

10:55.944 --> 10:58.212
Yeah, I would say so.
Then, how about we all

10:58.280 --> 11:00.781
get off this floating safe house
he put you up in.

11:00.848 --> 11:03.117
Maybe we should just get him
on the phone again,

11:03.184 --> 11:04.818
trace the call
and record his voice.

11:04.886 --> 11:06.286
Run it through
voice recognition software.

11:06.353 --> 11:08.121
You'll have to un-distort
it first;

11:08.188 --> 11:09.790
it's digitized.
Great. Gabe?

11:09.857 --> 11:10.990
We need your computer
to figure out

11:11.058 --> 11:12.191
who accessed those files.

11:12.259 --> 11:14.060
Which I'm happy to do
at my place.

11:14.128 --> 11:15.194
Yeah, I'll meet you guys there.

11:15.262 --> 11:16.563
I need to get to the hospital.

11:16.631 --> 11:18.698
What happened?

11:20.902 --> 11:22.635
<i>Sorry they called you.</i>

11:22.702 --> 11:24.570
Guess they found
your card on me and...

11:24.638 --> 11:26.339
No, no, I'm glad they did.

11:26.407 --> 11:28.908
Um, the nurse said that
your ended up in the Hudson.

11:28.976 --> 11:30.410
What happened?
I don't know.

11:30.477 --> 11:33.646
I was driving
along the West Side Highway,

11:33.713 --> 11:36.215
and the next thing I knew...

11:36.283 --> 11:37.817
Well, you've been traumatized.

11:37.884 --> 11:39.384
That's when accidents happen.
Are you okay?

11:39.453 --> 11:41.987
Yeah, I just have
a little bump on my head.

11:42.055 --> 11:43.889
I heard when they found you,
you were unconscious.

11:43.957 --> 11:46.258
Well, I just have
a headache now.

11:46.326 --> 11:48.994
But they're saying
that I have to stay here

11:49.062 --> 11:50.195
so I can be observed.

11:50.263 --> 11:52.431
I-I can't stay here

11:52.499 --> 11:53.866
on Thanksgiving.

11:53.934 --> 11:56.068
I mean, talk about traumatizing.

11:56.135 --> 11:58.837
You want me to watch you?

11:58.904 --> 12:01.106
You-You don't even have
to do that.

12:01.174 --> 12:02.674
You can just sign me out.

12:02.741 --> 12:05.377
If I sign you out,
I'm watching you.

12:10.816 --> 12:12.517
He's alive.

12:13.586 --> 12:14.752
What are you talking about?

12:14.820 --> 12:16.855
And worse, he probably suspects

12:16.922 --> 12:18.456
that I'm the one
who wants him dead.

12:18.524 --> 12:19.924
You're sure he's alive?

12:19.992 --> 12:22.293
Dead guys don't breathe
or hang up on you.

12:24.329 --> 12:27.866
And they don't
call you back, either!

12:27.933 --> 12:29.566
Just start cooking again.

12:29.634 --> 12:31.302
And I don't mean dinner.

12:31.370 --> 12:33.104
This is not over.

12:37.175 --> 12:38.642
Condor, I heard an explosion.

12:38.710 --> 12:39.943
Is everything okay?

12:40.012 --> 12:41.812
Mission was compromised, sir.

12:41.880 --> 12:43.080
Target must have rigged
the warehouse.

12:43.148 --> 12:44.281
At least you're safe.

12:44.349 --> 12:46.049
He trusted this guy?

12:46.117 --> 12:48.218
Yeah, I'm safe.

12:48.285 --> 12:50.053
So, what's my next move?

12:50.121 --> 12:51.788
I'm working on it; sit tight.

12:51.856 --> 12:54.157
Because I'm eager, sir.

12:54.225 --> 12:55.659
Final mission, right?

12:55.727 --> 12:57.379
Absolutely.
After this, you're done.

12:57.380 --> 12:58.657
It's over.

12:58.658 --> 12:59.724
Now, you stole my life,
you piece of...

12:59.792 --> 13:01.860
Vincent.
I am gonna hunt you down

13:01.927 --> 13:03.094
and I am gonna...

13:03.162 --> 13:05.530
Stop.

13:13.139 --> 13:15.140
That wasn't me

13:15.207 --> 13:17.942
being that way.
That was just me...

13:18.010 --> 13:19.377
Betrayed, I know.

13:19.444 --> 13:20.578
Yeah.

13:20.646 --> 13:22.880
We got enough.

13:22.947 --> 13:24.948
I'll tell you what we got.

13:25.016 --> 13:27.051
A botnet.

13:27.118 --> 13:29.220
On Gabe's computer;
it's a software where someone

13:29.288 --> 13:30.421
could access
your computer remotely.

13:30.489 --> 13:31.989
So I set a honey pot...

13:32.057 --> 13:33.324
Hey, JT, do we know

13:33.392 --> 13:34.912
who hacked into Gabe's computer
or not?

13:34.959 --> 13:36.393
It was the FBI.

13:36.460 --> 13:37.828
FBI?

13:37.896 --> 13:39.997
- What?
- I had a go-between.

13:40.065 --> 13:41.799
He was murdered;
his name was Agent Tucker.

13:41.866 --> 13:43.333
He was FBI.

13:43.401 --> 13:45.235
So your handler's FBI?

13:45.303 --> 13:46.737
Why didn't you just say so?

13:46.805 --> 13:48.839
You know, a honey pot
may sound easy to pull off...

13:48.907 --> 13:51.675
I said "go-between"
not "handler."

13:51.742 --> 13:54.911
I'm confused. Does this botnet
mean that your handler

13:54.978 --> 13:56.513
is FBI
or is the FBI stealing

13:56.581 --> 13:57.662
our files 'cause, you know,

13:57.715 --> 13:58.682
they don't want the public

13:58.749 --> 13:59.949
to know about beasts?

14:00.017 --> 14:01.351
Okay, the only thing we know

14:01.419 --> 14:02.952
for sure right now
is that we should have

14:03.020 --> 14:04.688
Thanksgiving dinner
with my father.

14:04.755 --> 14:06.155
What?

14:06.224 --> 14:08.157
Well, you heard how eager he is
to be family.

14:08.225 --> 14:10.659
So you're gonna expose Vincent
to your FBI father - And us.

14:10.728 --> 14:13.629
whom you've known for two seconds?
He doesn't need to know

14:13.697 --> 14:15.198
who's involved
or who we're even talking about.

14:15.265 --> 14:16.632
We can feel him out first.

14:16.700 --> 14:18.201
Vincent, you're
a human polygraph.

14:18.268 --> 14:20.036
You can tell
if he's trustworthy.

14:20.104 --> 14:22.438
Besides, he already admitted
to knowing about Muirfield,

14:22.505 --> 14:24.773
so it wouldn't be a
crazy conversation to bring up.

14:24.841 --> 14:26.842
I hate to say this,
but what if he's involved

14:26.909 --> 14:28.444
with this handler person
somehow?

14:28.511 --> 14:29.978
Okay, then we need
to know that, too.

14:30.046 --> 14:31.947
I know that it's a risk,

14:32.014 --> 14:34.116
but unless someone else has
a better idea...

14:37.621 --> 14:39.888
You are fine, right?

14:41.557 --> 14:44.226
Yeah.

14:44.936 --> 14:46.795
He's on his way here.

14:46.796 --> 14:48.197
My daughter called.

14:48.265 --> 14:49.232
She's bringing him here
for Thanksgiving.

14:49.299 --> 14:50.600
You want me to come up?

14:50.667 --> 14:52.167
I didn't spend all this time
covering

14:52.235 --> 14:54.195
my tracks so I can
have him killed on my property.

14:54.237 --> 14:56.672
Look, Catherine wouldn't
be bringing him here

14:56.740 --> 14:58.841
if she didn't need help,
which I plan on giving.

14:58.908 --> 15:00.009
I'm not following.

15:00.076 --> 15:01.243
Am I working tonight or not?

15:01.310 --> 15:03.345
Oh, you're working.

15:03.412 --> 15:05.412
He doesn't trust his handler,
but if I can get them

15:05.448 --> 15:06.682
to trust me as a father,

15:06.750 --> 15:08.082
then I can send him off
after this...

15:08.151 --> 15:10.118
Evil handler? Genius.

15:10.186 --> 15:12.554
Except isn't he, like,
a lie detector?

15:12.622 --> 15:14.589
Just keep me posted
with an ETA

15:14.657 --> 15:16.758
on the explosives.

15:16.825 --> 15:18.593
<i>Okay, I feel underdressed.</i>

15:18.661 --> 15:22.264
We're here to assess him,
not get his approval.

15:22.331 --> 15:25.066
Right, play detective
over turkey.

15:25.134 --> 15:26.901
Okay, maybe we should
just come up with a code word

15:26.969 --> 15:28.235
just so I can let you know if

15:28.303 --> 15:30.471
and when it's okay
to come clean.

15:30.539 --> 15:31.779
About a beast we happen to know

15:31.807 --> 15:32.974
who is being hunted
by his handler.

15:33.042 --> 15:34.123
That's all we're gonna say.

15:34.143 --> 15:36.443
Mashed potatoes?

15:36.511 --> 15:38.212
What?
The code.

15:38.280 --> 15:39.914
Okay, but what if he's serving
mashed potatoes,

15:39.982 --> 15:42.263
and you say "Pass the potatoes"
how am I supposed to know?

15:43.818 --> 15:45.952
What about pumpkin?

15:46.020 --> 15:48.055
That's coffee,
and what if there's pumpkin pie?

15:48.122 --> 15:50.957
Hopefully we'll figure
it out before dessert.

15:51.025 --> 15:52.626
Wait, what if he asks

15:52.694 --> 15:54.495
what it is I do for a living?

15:54.563 --> 15:56.297
Uh, you went to med school?

15:56.364 --> 15:58.431
That is not a living.
You're gonna be fine.

15:58.499 --> 16:01.068
He gonna be putty in your hands;
just don't shake too hard.

16:08.475 --> 16:09.943
This place is beautiful.

16:10.011 --> 16:11.611
Oh, hey.

16:11.679 --> 16:14.314
I, uh, hope there wasn't
too much traffic.

16:14.381 --> 16:15.481
No, it was fine.

16:15.549 --> 16:17.483
Uh, this is Vincent,

16:17.551 --> 16:19.519
my, uh, boyfriend.

16:19.587 --> 16:21.821
And this is my father.

16:21.888 --> 16:23.189
Is that all you got?

16:23.257 --> 16:24.857
It's nice to meet you, sir.

16:24.925 --> 16:26.459
Oh, call me Bob.

16:26.527 --> 16:29.629
Hey, uh, let me show you the house.
Great.

16:35.268 --> 16:36.702
Target must have
rigged the warehouse.

16:36.770 --> 16:38.704
At least you're safe.

16:38.772 --> 16:39.872
That sound more normal?

16:39.940 --> 16:41.607
On Mars.

16:41.674 --> 16:44.009
I've been working on this
thing for the past 12 hours.

16:44.077 --> 16:45.717
How about a little
positive reinforcement?

16:45.779 --> 16:48.280
I'm not feeling
very positive right now.

16:48.348 --> 16:50.115
Why? Cat said
she isn't gonna expose you.

16:50.182 --> 16:51.983
No, it's not that, it's just,

16:52.051 --> 16:54.185
I dread this holiday so much.
Which part?

16:54.254 --> 16:56.154
It's the part
where my family grills me

16:56.222 --> 16:58.023
about my single status,
and there are no gifts

16:58.090 --> 16:59.224
to offset the humiliation.

16:59.292 --> 17:01.126
Then don't go.

17:01.193 --> 17:02.961
Tell them you're working,

17:03.028 --> 17:04.528
which you are.

17:04.596 --> 17:06.696
We can boycott
the holidays together.

17:06.766 --> 17:07.799
Just you and me?

17:07.867 --> 17:08.833
And some beer

17:08.901 --> 17:09.901
and pizza

17:09.969 --> 17:11.202
and creepy guy's voice.

17:11.270 --> 17:12.637
Can we start drinking now?

17:12.704 --> 17:14.204
Absolutely.

17:14.272 --> 17:16.674
This is gonna be
the best Thanksgiving ever.

17:16.742 --> 17:19.377
Non-Thanksgiving.

17:21.079 --> 17:23.748
<i>A boat, really?</i>

17:23.815 --> 17:26.916
You pay property taxes on that?

17:26.984 --> 17:28.753
It was a gift.

17:28.820 --> 17:30.821
What-what did you say you do

17:30.889 --> 17:32.856
for a living again?
Oh, I-I didn't.

17:32.924 --> 17:34.858
Vincent's a doctor.
Where do you practice?

17:34.926 --> 17:36.660
He's on sabbatical.
I was a doctor.

17:36.727 --> 17:38.829
What, malpractice?
What, did you kill somebody?

17:46.470 --> 17:49.039
Can you tell I'm nervous?

17:49.107 --> 17:49.940
No.
Yes.

17:50.008 --> 17:52.276
You live on a boat,

17:52.343 --> 17:54.243
you can't tell me what you do,
and I know I haven't been

17:54.312 --> 17:56.613
your father very long, but it's
hard not to be protective.

17:56.681 --> 17:59.449
Of course, I would probably feel
the same way, sir.

17:59.517 --> 18:02.018
It's a really nice boat,

18:02.085 --> 18:04.354
if that, uh,
makes any difference.

18:04.422 --> 18:06.456
Okay, now I'm making
you nervous.

18:06.524 --> 18:09.458
No, um, you are my dad.

18:09.526 --> 18:11.093
Who's been MIA for 29 years,

18:11.161 --> 18:14.230
so who am I to judge?

18:14.298 --> 18:15.898
This cookie is delicious.

18:15.966 --> 18:18.201
Um, is there pumpkin in them?

18:18.268 --> 18:20.536
I can't tell yet.

18:20.603 --> 18:21.938
Yet?
You haven't even had one.

18:22.005 --> 18:23.906
Right, sorry, it's just, uh...

18:23.974 --> 18:26.274
You know, it's a loaded
subject for Catherine.

18:26.343 --> 18:27.876
Her mom used to make
these pumpkin muffins,

18:27.944 --> 18:29.712
and, well, it's
a holiday, so...

18:29.779 --> 18:31.447
So, so I've been thinking
about her

18:31.514 --> 18:34.383
a lot lately,
about you and she met

18:34.451 --> 18:36.151
when she was

18:36.219 --> 18:38.053
working at Muirfield.

18:39.322 --> 18:40.443
It's too bad she didn't know

18:40.457 --> 18:42.224
what that company was.

18:42.291 --> 18:44.092
Uh, why?
Because-because they killed her

18:44.160 --> 18:46.962
or because you know
what Muirfield was,

18:47.029 --> 18:48.830
what she was working on,
exactly?

18:48.898 --> 18:50.966
What do you know?

18:52.235 --> 18:53.801
What do you know?

18:53.870 --> 18:56.271
I know she was working
on a project

18:56.339 --> 18:58.773
and the results
were exterminated. Why?

19:01.543 --> 19:03.478
I can't tell if there's
pumpkin in these.

19:03.545 --> 19:06.113
You two are having
a separate conversation.

19:06.181 --> 19:07.582
What are we really
talking about?

19:07.649 --> 19:10.651
We are talking

19:10.719 --> 19:13.254
about the results
of that project,

19:13.321 --> 19:15.589
and how not all of...

19:15.656 --> 19:17.258
all of them were exterminated.

19:17.325 --> 19:19.526
What, there are beasts
out there?

19:19.594 --> 19:21.528
A friend of ours is one.

19:21.596 --> 19:22.763
God.

19:22.830 --> 19:24.031
Excuse me. I...

19:24.099 --> 19:25.299
Wrong pipe.

19:25.367 --> 19:27.768
Okay, this person...
He or she...

19:27.835 --> 19:29.676
They-They're in trouble,
and we need your help.

19:29.737 --> 19:31.505
Okay, this friend,

19:31.572 --> 19:34.207
how close,
because they were dangerous

19:34.275 --> 19:36.142
and out of control.
Our friend is different.

19:36.210 --> 19:38.211
And whoever it was that had been
helping them navigate the world,

19:38.279 --> 19:39.446
now they're trying to kill them,

19:39.514 --> 19:41.515
and we think that

19:41.582 --> 19:44.785
this handler is connected
to the FBI.

19:44.852 --> 19:46.319
You want me to track

19:46.387 --> 19:48.988
a beast handler?
If it puts you

19:49.056 --> 19:50.223
in an uncomfortable
position, sir...

19:50.291 --> 19:51.657
No, Bob, Dad,

19:51.725 --> 19:53.526
we're talking
about saving somebody

19:53.593 --> 19:56.162
who was a victim of Muirfield,
just like Mom was.

20:02.069 --> 20:03.803
Look, dinner's not
for a few hours.

20:03.870 --> 20:06.338
Why don't you give me
all the information you have?

20:06.406 --> 20:07.873
I'll see what I can find.

20:07.941 --> 20:10.242
Thank you.

20:12.111 --> 20:13.679
I never said "pumpkin."

20:13.747 --> 20:15.514
He knows you were here
for a reason.

20:15.582 --> 20:17.650
Gabe, it's me. Yeah.

20:17.717 --> 20:19.552
We need you to pull together
whatever research you have.

20:19.619 --> 20:21.553
So Reynolds has agreed to help?

20:21.620 --> 20:23.855
Yeah, he wants to see what we've
got, but it can't be anything

20:23.923 --> 20:25.856
that suggests that we broke the
law or that Vincent's involved.

20:25.924 --> 20:27.491
I'll send a messenger
to pick it up.

20:27.559 --> 20:29.026
Someone just put a botnet
on my computer.

20:29.094 --> 20:30.361
I am not handing over
confidential files

20:30.429 --> 20:32.663
to a stranger;
I'll bring them.

20:32.730 --> 20:34.598
And risk outing yourself
as being involved?

20:34.666 --> 20:36.267
I'm already exposed.
Okay, so you'll out me,

20:36.335 --> 20:37.701
but you won't out him?

20:39.104 --> 20:40.271
Not officially,

20:40.339 --> 20:41.672
and I never outed you.

20:41.739 --> 20:43.239
I didn't even specify a gender.

20:43.307 --> 20:45.742
Um, why don't you text me
that address.

20:45.810 --> 20:47.611
I'm getting in the car.

20:47.679 --> 20:49.379
We're going for a drive.

20:50.982 --> 20:52.916
Okay, you're right.

20:52.984 --> 20:55.586
I didn't wait for the code,
but you seemed

20:55.653 --> 20:59.055
like you were waffling,
and then he said "beasts."

20:59.123 --> 21:01.057
Yeah, okay, maybe
it was a trap

21:01.125 --> 21:02.425
to get us to open up.

21:02.493 --> 21:04.560
You think he's involved?
No...

21:04.628 --> 21:05.795
I-I don't know.

21:05.863 --> 21:07.364
Okay, his heart
was racing,

21:07.431 --> 21:09.199
but, you know,
maybe he was nervous

21:09.266 --> 21:10.433
because you're going
out with a guy

21:10.501 --> 21:11.734
who lives
on a boat.

21:11.802 --> 21:13.236
Okay, so do you
not trust him

21:13.304 --> 21:14.904
because you're
sensing something,

21:14.972 --> 21:16.906
or because he was
grilling you?

21:16.974 --> 21:18.140
Because that's
what dads do

21:18.208 --> 21:19.876
with their daughter's
boyfriends.

21:19.943 --> 21:21.110
Okay, so now
he's your "dad"?

21:21.177 --> 21:22.378
No, that's...

21:22.445 --> 21:24.213
that's not what
this is about.

21:24.280 --> 21:25.882
Someone tried
to blow you up,

21:25.949 --> 21:29.151
and Bob is
offering to help.

21:29.219 --> 21:31.887
And... I don't know, if you,
if you think about it,

21:31.954 --> 21:33.722
nothing's been exposed.

21:33.789 --> 21:36.425
You know, he thinks that
beasts are out of control,

21:36.493 --> 21:37.659
and there you were,

21:37.727 --> 21:39.128
this vision of control,

21:39.195 --> 21:40.462
just enjoying your
non-pumpkin cookies

21:40.530 --> 21:41.730
while he was
going at you.

21:41.797 --> 21:43.399
He was, wasn't he?

21:43.466 --> 21:45.267
Totally.

21:45.335 --> 21:47.002
We have been so worried

21:47.069 --> 21:48.269
about what's
going on with you,

21:48.337 --> 21:49.638
but you are fine.

21:53.676 --> 21:54.609
Mm-mm-mm.

21:54.677 --> 21:56.177
No, no, no.

21:56.245 --> 21:57.646
It's your dad's place.

21:57.713 --> 21:59.848
Oh, it's like we're
in high school.

21:59.916 --> 22:01.249
Or an alternate
universe.

22:15.664 --> 22:17.432
Yeah?

22:19.234 --> 22:21.501
Lowan.
Sorry to disturb your holiday.

22:21.570 --> 22:23.503
I just needed to get
these to Catherine.

22:23.572 --> 22:25.439
Wait, she called you?

22:25.506 --> 22:27.307
So, you know
about...

22:27.375 --> 22:29.309
I'm part of
the investigation, yes.

22:29.377 --> 22:31.612
Anyway...
No, wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait.

22:31.680 --> 22:32.947
Come in, come in.

22:33.014 --> 22:35.783
So you just drove
two hours out of the city

22:35.850 --> 22:37.184
on a holiday,

22:37.251 --> 22:39.119
implicating
yourself in this,

22:39.187 --> 22:42.456
because... Catherine
called you and asked?

22:42.523 --> 22:44.491
Kind of owe your
daughter my life.

22:44.559 --> 22:46.493
Why don't you
stay for dinner?

22:46.561 --> 22:48.328
- Actually, I gotta get going...
- Gabe.

22:48.396 --> 22:49.563
That was fast.

22:49.630 --> 22:51.364
He dropped
everything

22:51.432 --> 22:52.999
and came all the way
up here for you.

22:53.067 --> 22:54.200
And for our friend.

22:54.267 --> 22:56.069
Right.
Vincent,

22:56.136 --> 22:58.137
do you know ADA Lowan?
Yeah.

22:58.205 --> 22:59.405
Hey, we have met before.
Hey.

22:59.473 --> 23:01.140
So, Lowan, my daughter

23:01.208 --> 23:03.710
tells me this "friend"
is not dangerous.

23:03.777 --> 23:05.737
What do you think of that?
I think it's... - Tori.

23:05.779 --> 23:07.747
I thought you were
gonna stay in the car.

23:07.815 --> 23:09.248
You're-you're
Windsor's daughter.

23:09.316 --> 23:10.483
What is she
doing here?

23:10.550 --> 23:11.917
Uh, Tori, this is

23:11.985 --> 23:13.219
Detective Chandler's
boyfriend, Vincent.

23:13.286 --> 23:14.520
It's nice to meet
you, Vincent.

23:14.588 --> 23:16.589
It's nice
to meet you, too.

23:16.656 --> 23:18.390
Tori had a concussion,

23:18.458 --> 23:20.493
and the hospital said
she had to be observed,

23:20.560 --> 23:21.827
and it's Thanksgiving, so...
I-I gotta...

23:21.894 --> 23:24.163
So you didn't want her
to be alone

23:24.231 --> 23:25.731
in the hospital
over Thanksgiving.

23:25.798 --> 23:28.233
You know, you and I butt
heads a lot on the job,

23:28.300 --> 23:30.235
but he's actually
a not bad guy.

23:30.302 --> 23:31.670
Are you okay, Vincent?

23:31.738 --> 23:33.238
I'm fine.

23:33.305 --> 23:34.606
Hey, look, I'm sorry
about all my comments

23:34.674 --> 23:36.842
about your lack
of employment

23:36.909 --> 23:39.344
or unconventional
living situation, but...

23:39.411 --> 23:41.279
Vincent!

23:43.516 --> 23:44.516
Vincent, stop!

23:44.583 --> 23:46.184
Vincent, please!

23:49.087 --> 23:50.054
Uh...

23:57.592 --> 23:58.611
I'm so sorry.

23:58.612 --> 24:01.013
We wanted to tell you,
we just didn't know how.

24:01.081 --> 24:02.281
He's not usually
like this.

24:02.349 --> 24:03.282
Something
came over him.

24:03.350 --> 24:04.517
So you knew
about this too?

24:04.585 --> 24:06.285
We are all in law enforcement

24:06.353 --> 24:08.521
for the same reason,
to protect victims.

24:08.589 --> 24:10.289
Vincent is a victim.

24:10.357 --> 24:11.624
A "victim"?

24:11.692 --> 24:12.759
Who else has he hurt?

24:12.826 --> 24:13.760
Only perps.

24:13.827 --> 24:17.196
What are you two
covering up?

24:17.264 --> 24:20.933
Windsor was brutally murdered
by Tori's kidnapper,

24:21.001 --> 24:23.235
who eluded us.

24:23.303 --> 24:24.469
His killing was inhuman,

24:24.537 --> 24:26.972
it was animal.

24:28.108 --> 24:30.409
He did it.

24:30.476 --> 24:31.944
He killed
Tori's father.

24:32.012 --> 24:33.445
Who was a beast, too.

24:33.513 --> 24:35.414
Please, you can't
expose us,

24:35.481 --> 24:36.948
you can't expose Vincent,

24:37.016 --> 24:38.417
he saved Tori's life.

24:39.952 --> 24:41.953
I know it's
a lot to ask.

24:42.021 --> 24:43.822
God, you are lucky I gave
the staff the holiday off.

24:43.890 --> 24:45.156
You wanted to be family.

24:45.224 --> 24:46.157
That's what
I need right now,

24:46.225 --> 24:48.827
I need family.

24:48.895 --> 24:50.535
Vincent is not asking
you to be complicit,

24:50.562 --> 24:51.762
Gabe isn't...

24:51.830 --> 24:54.465
I am, as...
as your daughter.

24:55.968 --> 24:58.002
Please, just give him
a second chance.

24:58.070 --> 25:00.738
I need to talk
to him first.

25:03.642 --> 25:05.243
Okay.

25:09.648 --> 25:12.650
He wants to talk to you.
I swear,

25:12.717 --> 25:14.819
I was feeling fine, and...
He knows everything.

25:14.886 --> 25:17.254
Not only you're the "friend",
which he didn't know

25:17.322 --> 25:19.022
until you attacked him
in his own home.

25:19.090 --> 25:21.459
But he also
figured out Windsor,

25:21.526 --> 25:23.807
and it's not gonna be long before he
figures out the rest.

25:23.861 --> 25:26.263
This isn't just
you and me anymore,

25:26.331 --> 25:27.697
this is Gabe,

25:27.765 --> 25:29.433
and it could be
Tess and JT, too,

25:29.500 --> 25:32.269
so I don't care if you have to get
down on your knees

25:32.337 --> 25:33.536
and beg for
forgiveness,

25:33.604 --> 25:35.005
you need to prove to him

25:35.073 --> 25:36.306
that you are in control,

25:36.374 --> 25:38.275
just like you
somehow convinced me.

25:47.250 --> 25:48.785
Target must
have rigged the warehouse.

25:48.853 --> 25:50.386
But at least you're safe.

25:50.454 --> 25:52.722
Want more pizza?

25:52.790 --> 25:54.991
What, do I sound weird?

25:58.962 --> 26:00.963
Why are you still single?

26:01.031 --> 26:02.331
Hey!

26:02.399 --> 26:04.159
This is not my family
Thanksgiving, remember?

26:04.201 --> 26:06.469
That wasn't me
grilling you,

26:06.536 --> 26:09.138
that was just me.

26:09.206 --> 26:10.506
It's 'cause "I'm a cop",

26:10.573 --> 26:12.307
"I'm intimidating",

26:12.375 --> 26:14.476
"I'm not feminine enough."

26:14.544 --> 26:16.678
These are direct quotes
from my grandmother.

26:16.746 --> 26:18.079
That's crazy.

26:18.147 --> 26:19.515
Hey, I was a Cub Scout.

26:19.582 --> 26:21.216
Which is cool,

26:21.283 --> 26:22.851
but believe me,

26:22.919 --> 26:24.653
when I met you,
I knew...

26:24.721 --> 26:26.421
...you were a girl.

26:26.489 --> 26:28.756
I feel so much better
about myself now.

26:28.824 --> 26:31.426
Tess, I could
barely speak.

26:31.494 --> 26:33.661
In a good way.

26:33.729 --> 26:36.364
I asked the question
because I don't get it.

26:36.432 --> 26:38.933
You're smart,
you're gorgeous,

26:39.001 --> 26:41.736
you drink pizza
and beer...

26:41.803 --> 26:43.405
I don't drink pizza.

26:43.472 --> 26:44.672
Okay.

26:44.740 --> 26:46.507
And... maybe you
couldn't speak

26:46.575 --> 26:49.510
because my grandma's right,
I'm intimidating.

26:49.578 --> 26:54.181
No, I-I couldn't
speak because...

27:02.490 --> 27:04.925
I wanted to do that.

27:19.139 --> 27:20.907
Hello?

27:20.975 --> 27:22.408
Please tell me
you traced the call

27:22.476 --> 27:24.109
or de-digitized that voice.

27:24.177 --> 27:26.045
- Uh, yeah, we're working on it.
- Well, work faster,

27:26.112 --> 27:28.113
'cause I don't think
we can count on Reynolds.

27:30.316 --> 27:31.784
We should probably,
you know...

27:31.851 --> 27:32.952
Yeah, totally.
Yep.

27:37.190 --> 27:39.091
There you are.

27:39.158 --> 27:40.425
Oh, hey.

27:40.493 --> 27:42.394
Ready to go?

27:42.462 --> 27:44.329
Actually, I told Agent Reynolds
that we weren't leaving yet.

27:44.397 --> 27:47.732
But you said we were
just gonna go for a drive,

27:47.800 --> 27:49.634
and my head is starting
to hurt, so...

27:49.702 --> 27:50.942
Tori, did you see
what happened?

27:50.970 --> 27:52.604
What?

27:52.671 --> 27:55.807
Nothing happened, I'm-I'm fine.

27:55.874 --> 27:57.909
Vincent lost control
on Agent Reynolds,

27:57.977 --> 27:59.744
and now he knows what
he did to your father.

27:59.812 --> 28:01.278
Which is why
we need to stay,

28:01.346 --> 28:02.747
to convince Reynolds

28:02.815 --> 28:04.248
that Vincent
isn't dangerous.

28:04.316 --> 28:05.984
Can't Catherine do that?

28:06.051 --> 28:08.853
Tori, I said that there is
nothing you could've done

28:08.921 --> 28:11.489
to save your father,
but you're the only one

28:11.556 --> 28:13.076
who can explain
that Vincent saved you.

28:18.263 --> 28:19.696
Beautiful
out here.

28:19.764 --> 28:21.698
It is.

28:22.834 --> 28:24.468
Look, sir, uh,

28:24.536 --> 28:26.170
I'm very sorry about...
Sorry?

28:26.238 --> 28:27.671
About almost killing me?

28:27.739 --> 28:30.507
You know, when we
first pulled up,

28:30.574 --> 28:32.375
I was so worried about
what I was wearing.

28:32.443 --> 28:35.211
Just wanted to make
a good impression, but...

28:35.279 --> 28:37.280
obviously, my shirt's
not the problem.

28:37.348 --> 28:39.449
Well, it was a tip-off.

28:39.517 --> 28:41.484
Could've worn a tie.
Do you own one?

28:41.552 --> 28:43.787
No.

28:43.855 --> 28:45.789
No, and I don't
have a job,

28:45.857 --> 28:47.457
and I live on a boat.

28:47.525 --> 28:50.893
And yes, I have the DNA
of several different species.

28:52.863 --> 28:54.797
But sir,
I'm not asking for approval,

28:54.865 --> 28:56.032
'cause I understand
that no father

28:56.099 --> 28:57.567
would probably ever approve...

28:57.635 --> 29:00.036
But you are asking me
to protect you?

29:00.103 --> 29:01.404
No.

29:01.472 --> 29:03.139
I don't care
what you do about me.

29:03.206 --> 29:07.143
But just.... please,
don't ruin their lives.

29:09.713 --> 29:11.180
I'll take a look at those files,

29:11.247 --> 29:12.447
see if I can find
your handler.

29:12.482 --> 29:14.349
I'm sensing a "but."

29:17.120 --> 29:19.055
You're right.

29:20.456 --> 29:23.192
No father would
ever approve.

29:23.259 --> 29:24.826
So, you disappear

29:24.894 --> 29:26.228
from her life

29:26.296 --> 29:27.576
and I won't say
a word to anybody

29:27.630 --> 29:28.697
about what she's
covered up for you.

29:28.764 --> 29:29.698
And if you don't,

29:29.765 --> 29:32.100
I'm gonna
turn her in.

29:33.636 --> 29:35.870
Lose her,
your daughter...

29:35.938 --> 29:38.039
...to save her, yeah.

29:38.107 --> 29:41.242
You'll be doing the same
if you walk away.

29:41.310 --> 29:43.611
In the meantime,
she wants

29:43.679 --> 29:45.413
a family Thanksgiving,
and we're gonna give it to her.

29:45.480 --> 29:47.215
Besides...

29:47.282 --> 29:49.217
I'm starving.

29:55.729 --> 29:57.163
Dinner's ready!

29:57.430 --> 30:00.432
I didn't realize we were
still celebrating.

30:00.500 --> 30:02.568
Well, you came all
the way up here.

30:02.635 --> 30:05.571
Besides, Vincent and I
had a really good talk,

30:05.638 --> 30:06.805
didn't we, Vincent?

30:06.874 --> 30:08.274
Uh, yeah.

30:08.342 --> 30:10.910
Your... dad has agreed
to help us out.

30:10.978 --> 30:13.612
Oh, that's great.

30:13.680 --> 30:15.280
Gabe, Tori,

30:15.348 --> 30:16.382
sit anywhere you want.

30:16.449 --> 30:18.617
The, uh, staff is off,

30:18.685 --> 30:20.118
so it's serve yourself.

30:20.186 --> 30:21.820
Oh, this looks amazing.

30:21.888 --> 30:24.556
Yeah, thanks for letting us
crash your family dinner.

30:24.624 --> 30:26.592
Well, let's just hope there
are no more "crashes."

30:26.659 --> 30:29.127
Both cars
and otherwise.

30:29.195 --> 30:30.828
If you're speaking
about Vincent,

30:30.897 --> 30:32.931
- he saved my life.
- Oh, I know, it's all

30:32.999 --> 30:33.932
out in the open now.

30:34.000 --> 30:34.960
We just want you to know

30:35.001 --> 30:35.934
he's a good guy.

30:36.002 --> 30:37.568
Are you okay?

30:37.636 --> 30:38.803
I am aware of his
many attributes.

30:38.871 --> 30:40.906
Yeah.
Okay.

30:40.973 --> 30:42.407
There's no need for
whispering at the table.

30:42.474 --> 30:43.641
Sorry.

30:43.709 --> 30:44.910
That's okay.

30:44.977 --> 30:46.143
No apologies necessary.

30:46.211 --> 30:48.312
Let's have a toast.

30:48.380 --> 30:50.981
Uh...

30:51.049 --> 30:53.484
to my first holiday
with my daughter.

30:53.552 --> 30:54.919
I've stayed away
a long time,

30:54.986 --> 30:57.321
not because
I didn't love you,

30:57.389 --> 30:58.629
but because that's
what love is.

30:58.657 --> 31:00.658
Sacrificing
your own needs

31:00.726 --> 31:02.459
for the person
you love.

31:04.930 --> 31:06.297
Cheers.

31:06.364 --> 31:08.665
Cheers. Cheers.
Cheers.

31:08.733 --> 31:11.135
Thank you
for saving me.

31:13.405 --> 31:15.105
Vincent?

31:15.173 --> 31:16.673
Are you okay?

31:18.410 --> 31:21.010
Oh, no.
Vincent?

31:21.078 --> 31:23.212
We don't have to move
all the knives, do we?

31:23.280 --> 31:24.948
Would you just excuse me
for one second?

31:25.015 --> 31:26.015
What? It was just a joke.

31:26.083 --> 31:27.083
Really?
Because it sounded

31:27.084 --> 31:29.352
like a veiled message to me.

31:29.420 --> 31:30.654
It was very genuine.

31:30.721 --> 31:32.522
I haven't been
in your life.

31:32.590 --> 31:33.890
Exactly, which is why
we're not here

31:33.958 --> 31:35.458
for your parental
approval.

31:35.525 --> 31:37.160
I told you we
shouldn't have come here.

31:37.227 --> 31:38.328
Tori, are you okay?

31:38.395 --> 31:39.862
Someone is trying
to kill Vincent,

31:39.930 --> 31:41.497
just like
they killed Mom,

31:41.565 --> 31:43.532
just like they kill every victim of
their experiments.

31:43.600 --> 31:45.501
That's because
they're dangerous.

31:45.569 --> 31:46.502
What?

31:48.305 --> 31:49.572
Oh, my God!
Tori?

31:58.281 --> 31:59.181
Did you know?

31:59.248 --> 32:00.516
No, of course not.

32:00.584 --> 32:02.050
If I had known,
I never would've...

32:02.118 --> 32:03.519
Asked me to cover up

32:03.587 --> 32:04.553
for two of them?

32:04.621 --> 32:06.088
No, brought her here.

32:06.155 --> 32:08.556
Tori must be
what's making Vincent worse.

32:08.624 --> 32:11.926
Attacking you, that-that
Windsor's heart, now this?

32:11.995 --> 32:13.928
She's been there, every time.

32:13.997 --> 32:16.231
All right, so, it's
not Vincent's fault?

32:16.299 --> 32:18.333
We told you,
he's never like this.

32:18.401 --> 32:20.568
Look, honey, I know
I haven't earned the right to...

32:20.636 --> 32:22.871
To call me "honey"?
Give my approval.

32:22.938 --> 32:24.272
Or my advice.

32:24.340 --> 32:26.674
But that behavior
is encoded in his DNA.

32:26.742 --> 32:29.010
Part of his DNA.
Right.

32:29.077 --> 32:31.412
He's a victim
who only hurts bad guys.

32:31.480 --> 32:32.914
When are you going to stop
making excuses for him?

32:32.982 --> 32:34.916
I am not making excuses.

32:34.984 --> 32:38.753
I am trying to make the best
out of a terrible situation.

32:38.821 --> 32:40.421
Which Windsor has obviously
handed down to Tori.

32:40.489 --> 32:42.923
You don't want this
in your future.

32:42.991 --> 32:46.060
Look, Thanksgiving...
L-Life is hard enough

32:46.128 --> 32:48.262
with a full-fledged human being.

32:48.330 --> 32:50.064
Is that what happened with Mom?

32:50.132 --> 32:52.099
Things got too difficult?

32:52.167 --> 32:54.535
So much for your big speech

32:54.602 --> 32:56.237
about sacrifices.

32:56.304 --> 32:58.805
I never said love
was unconditional.

32:58.873 --> 33:00.707
At some point,
enough is enough.

33:02.343 --> 33:03.544
I can't find her.

33:04.846 --> 33:06.446
What if she's trying again?

33:06.514 --> 33:07.648
Trying what?

33:07.715 --> 33:09.249
The car crash wasn't
an accident.

33:09.316 --> 33:12.252
Tori came to my office
asking about flat lining.

33:12.319 --> 33:13.954
And then she drove
her car into a river.

33:14.022 --> 33:15.155
She is trying to kill

33:15.222 --> 33:17.290
that part of herself,
and I missed it.

33:17.358 --> 33:19.825
We all missed it.

33:19.893 --> 33:21.494
Bob, I know you don't
approve of Vincent,

33:21.529 --> 33:23.289
and that's fine, but
Tori, she's an innocent.

33:23.297 --> 33:25.231
Whoever's after Vincent,

33:25.299 --> 33:27.400
they want to exterminate
all beasts.

33:27.468 --> 33:30.836
And it's only a matter of time
before they go after her, too.

33:31.375 --> 33:33.543
Well, like I said to Vincent,

33:33.610 --> 33:36.946
I'll make a couple of calls.

33:41.185 --> 33:44.254
There are two of them now,
which actually might help us.

33:44.321 --> 33:46.256
Just get up here.

33:51.528 --> 33:55.396
I think you need
to stay away from me.

33:57.166 --> 33:58.934
What?

33:59.001 --> 34:01.603
But you saw... you...

34:01.671 --> 34:03.237
you know what I am.

34:03.305 --> 34:05.073
Yeah.

34:05.140 --> 34:07.442
You should probably go talk
to someone else about it.

34:07.509 --> 34:09.177
Who?

34:09.244 --> 34:10.844
You're the only one.

34:10.911 --> 34:13.114
And, I mean, you saved me.

34:13.181 --> 34:16.951
So, what, now you're
my responsibility?

34:17.018 --> 34:20.088
I don't have anybody else
to talk to about this.

34:20.155 --> 34:23.657
Please, just don't-don't cry.

34:23.725 --> 34:27.527
No one else is gonna
want me around either.

34:27.596 --> 34:30.598
Tori, look,
it's not personal, okay?

34:31.866 --> 34:34.134
You do something to me.

34:34.202 --> 34:36.268
I don't mean to.

34:36.337 --> 34:38.472
I don't want to be this way.

34:40.074 --> 34:42.009
But I want a life.

34:42.077 --> 34:44.210
Just like everybody else.

34:45.552 --> 34:47.386
I know.

34:47.454 --> 34:49.722
You do know.

34:49.790 --> 34:51.757
Which is why

34:51.824 --> 34:54.594
you can't tell me to stay away.

34:57.464 --> 34:59.164
Come here.

35:11.567 --> 35:14.736
I can't.

35:43.301 --> 35:44.995
Catherine.
Not now.

35:44.996 --> 35:47.131
Okay, for the record,
she kissed me.

35:47.199 --> 35:48.265
Is that supposed
to make this better?

35:48.333 --> 35:49.433
N-No...

35:49.500 --> 35:51.134
Come on, she's like me.

35:51.202 --> 35:52.936
Great, then maybe
you belong together.

35:53.003 --> 35:55.305
That's not what I meant.

35:55.373 --> 35:56.840
I know what you meant,
I know that she has

35:56.907 --> 35:57.988
some sort of effect on you.

35:58.008 --> 36:00.444
Yes, yes, okay, she was there

36:00.511 --> 36:02.145
when I attacked Reynolds,
when I killed Windsor...

36:02.213 --> 36:03.453
Okay, so,
this isn't your fault?

36:03.514 --> 36:05.115
You're kissing someone else.

36:05.182 --> 36:07.383
And I'm supposed to write
this off as a pheromone thing?

36:07.417 --> 36:09.352
And it's not even
the kiss that upsets me.

36:09.419 --> 36:12.421
It's-it's that we keep
making excuses for you.

36:12.489 --> 36:14.323
Whether it's Tori.

36:14.391 --> 36:15.358
Or-or the accumulation

36:15.425 --> 36:17.426
of this list.

36:17.494 --> 36:18.828
Or you don't remember me.

36:18.896 --> 36:20.130
My father...

36:20.197 --> 36:22.365
and-and he is my father,

36:22.432 --> 36:23.966
he-he's looking out for me.

36:24.033 --> 36:27.202
He reminded me that at
some point enough's enough.

36:27.271 --> 36:29.972
Vincent, when does this all end?

36:31.508 --> 36:32.875
It doesn't.

36:32.942 --> 36:34.977
Your father's right.

36:35.044 --> 36:36.879
What?

36:36.946 --> 36:38.213
There's no excuse

36:38.281 --> 36:39.314
for what I've done, okay?

36:39.382 --> 36:41.349
For any of those things.

36:41.417 --> 36:44.119
Catherine, you keep worrying
that I'm losing myself

36:44.187 --> 36:46.521
to the other side, and I
keep telling you I'm fine.

36:46.589 --> 36:48.523
But the truth is I'm not,

36:48.591 --> 36:50.125
I'm not all.

36:50.193 --> 36:51.493
You need to walk away.

36:51.560 --> 36:54.462
Vincent, I was just
posing a question.

36:54.530 --> 36:55.797
Well, I'm not.

36:55.864 --> 36:58.700
And if you don't
walk away, I will.

37:14.082 --> 37:16.417
I'm so sorry I ruined
your Thanksgiving.

37:16.484 --> 37:17.651
Oh, come on.

37:17.719 --> 37:18.920
Wouldn't be Thanksgiving

37:18.987 --> 37:20.021
without a big family
blow out now.

37:20.088 --> 37:22.924
Look, he's here already.

37:22.991 --> 37:25.193
Told you my driver'd be
faster than a car service.

37:25.260 --> 37:27.394
Jeff, she's going into
the city, Upper East Side.

37:27.462 --> 37:29.730
Now I promise...

37:29.798 --> 37:31.231
your secret's safe with me.

37:31.299 --> 37:34.100
Thank you.

37:40.642 --> 37:43.376
<i>Target must've rigged the warehouse.</i>

37:43.444 --> 37:45.678
But at least you're safe.

37:47.315 --> 37:49.015
Did you hear that?

37:49.083 --> 37:51.718
I'm working on it, sit tight.
Like a hundred times.

37:51.785 --> 37:53.887
No, in the background.
I-It's-it's like a...

37:53.955 --> 37:55.856
It's like a song.
Can you pull that out?

37:55.923 --> 37:57.590
It'll still be digitized, but...

37:59.593 --> 38:01.627
Must've rigged the warehouse...

38:01.695 --> 38:03.929
Church bells, right?

38:03.997 --> 38:07.567
Okay, so, uh, whoever made
that call is a priest?

38:07.634 --> 38:10.202
Or he could live by a Church?

38:10.270 --> 38:12.037
We could do
a search on churches,

38:12.105 --> 38:15.040
cross-reference the melody.

38:15.108 --> 38:17.209
What? It's something.

38:17.277 --> 38:20.212
Tess, you don't have to deflect.

38:20.280 --> 38:21.646
I'm not gonna do that again.

38:21.714 --> 38:23.815
I'm genuinely excited
about the bells.

38:23.884 --> 38:25.317
Okay, but I'm just saying,

38:25.385 --> 38:27.753
I have zero expectations.
I took advantage.

38:27.820 --> 38:29.321
No, you didn't.

38:30.891 --> 38:32.824
I didn't?

38:32.892 --> 38:34.559
I mean, maybe a little, no.

38:34.627 --> 38:36.227
If I didn't want you to kiss me,

38:36.295 --> 38:39.130
you wouldn't have
because I am intimidating.

38:39.198 --> 38:40.832
So, we're all good.

38:40.900 --> 38:43.001
Just no one needs to know.

38:43.068 --> 38:45.404
Oh, it never happened.

38:47.707 --> 38:50.508
I'm gonna call Gabe now.

38:59.385 --> 39:01.652
She's upstairs crying.

39:03.355 --> 39:05.756
Catherine?

39:05.824 --> 39:07.658
Take it you took my advice?

39:07.726 --> 39:09.660
Yeah, you got what you wanted.

39:12.697 --> 39:15.098
Back at you.

39:15.166 --> 39:17.535
I can't verify
it's your handler,

39:17.602 --> 39:19.537
but according to the documents
that Gabe brought up,

39:19.604 --> 39:21.806
one of our ex-agents,
Tucker, was involved.

39:21.873 --> 39:24.141
We followed up
on his contacts.

39:24.208 --> 39:26.376
One stuck out,

39:26.444 --> 39:29.112
who's involved in non-FBI
sanctioned activities,

39:29.180 --> 39:30.880
which apparently includes

39:30.949 --> 39:33.616
a new target
in Windsor's building.

39:33.684 --> 39:35.652
Tori.

39:35.719 --> 39:37.787
I was gonna go check it out.

39:37.855 --> 39:39.789
No, if anything
happened to you...

39:39.857 --> 39:43.225
Catherine has been through
enough as it is.

39:50.033 --> 39:51.000
Take my car.

39:57.207 --> 39:58.874
I'll tell her you, uh...

39:58.942 --> 40:00.576
You don't have
to worry about that.

40:02.078 --> 40:03.178
She's not gonna be looking

40:03.245 --> 40:04.879
for me anytime soon.

40:08.951 --> 40:10.418
Hey.

40:10.486 --> 40:12.553
So that call with his handler?

40:12.621 --> 40:15.423
JT and Tess heard church bells
in the background.

40:15.491 --> 40:18.325
All this and we've have bells.

40:18.393 --> 40:20.728
I'm sorry I dragged
you up here.

40:20.796 --> 40:21.929
Into this.

40:21.997 --> 40:23.498
Now you're exposed, too.

40:23.565 --> 40:26.433
I can handle your father.

40:26.502 --> 40:28.102
Let me grab your bag.

40:28.169 --> 40:29.537
Thanks.

40:32.641 --> 40:35.876
You're probably regretting
inviting me out here.

40:35.943 --> 40:38.445
My housekeeper will,
but, uh, look, Catherine,

40:38.513 --> 40:40.714
I'll do my best
to find Vincent's handler.

40:40.781 --> 40:42.582
And as for your relationship,

40:42.650 --> 40:44.385
I'm sorry if I
over-stepped...

40:44.452 --> 40:46.253
No, it's, uh, it's okay.

40:46.321 --> 40:47.888
You were just being a dad.

40:47.955 --> 40:49.723
And, uh...

40:49.790 --> 40:52.792
I actually needed
family this holiday, so...

40:55.663 --> 40:56.863
Hey.

40:56.931 --> 40:58.264
Just know that
whatever happens,

40:58.332 --> 41:00.901
I'm always gonna be
looking out for you.

41:00.968 --> 41:02.602
Thanks.
