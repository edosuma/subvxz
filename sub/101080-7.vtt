It seems like
the girls are getting acquainted.
2
These women don't belong in this place.
3
You saw potential in them last year.
4
And I dismissed them
after a thorough evaluation.
5
You may have been too hasty.
6
Sister Crimson is an impressive warrior.
7
She's aggressive, undisciplined...
8
Sounds like someone I used to know.
9
...and possibly sociopathic.
10
You were the one
who said I hadn't taken enough interest
11
in the Order.
12
So I'm trying.
13
This isn't what I had in mind.
14
When Sister Shannon died,
15
new challenges emerged for the Order.
16
New measures are needed to combat them.
17
I haven't gotten to where I am
by hoping the same old methods
18
will solve new problems.
19
Piety, loyalty, and service.
20
One can't exist without the other.
21
I need you to deliver these.
22
What are they?
23
Solutions to problems.
24
Your Holiness, I appreciate you seeing...
25
Pray with me, Mother.
26
The Pope is dead.
27
It is a strange but pleasant
surprise to see you on such a dark day.
28
I hope you aren't here
because of trouble at the Order.
29
No.
30
I came for guidance.
31
Well, it's time to go.
32
The Vatican will be closed soon
for the Conclave, and there is much to do.
33
God be with you, Mother.
34
And with us all.
