00:02.200 --> 00:03.634
I'm a gladiator in a suit,

00:03.701 --> 00:04.701
'cause that's what you are
when you work for Olivia.

00:04.769 --> 00:05.902
You're a gladiator in a suit.

00:05.970 --> 00:07.070
Do you want to be
a gladiator in a suit?

00:07.138 --> 00:08.639
I want to be a gladiator
in a suit.

00:11.475 --> 00:13.108
(Harrison) And that's...
Olivia Pope.

00:13.177 --> 00:14.644
(Quinn) It is an honor
to work for your law firm.

00:14.711 --> 00:17.180
We're lawyers,
but this is not a law firm.

00:17.247 --> 00:18.881
Law firms are for pansies.
We solve problems...

00:18.948 --> 00:21.150
Manage crises,
save reputations.

00:21.218 --> 00:22.685
He needs a favor.
There's a girl,

00:22.752 --> 00:24.787
an aide going around saying
she's sleeping with him.

00:24.854 --> 00:26.355
(Projector and camera shutter clicking)
Her name is Amanda Tanner.

00:26.423 --> 00:27.822
Livvie.
(Chuckles)

00:27.890 --> 00:29.157
Mr. President.

00:29.225 --> 00:31.826
You've known me a long time,
longer than most.

00:31.894 --> 00:33.795
You know I did not fall
for some young girl.

00:33.862 --> 00:35.263
Amanda, it would be a mistake
to think there will be

00:35.331 --> 00:37.699
no consequences to you telling
lies about the president.

00:37.766 --> 00:40.268
(Crying) Why are you doing
this to me?

00:40.336 --> 00:41.903
I'm a good person.

00:41.970 --> 00:43.904
It's handled.

00:43.971 --> 00:46.540
I got a strange call,
some girl named Amanda Tanner.

00:46.608 --> 00:47.774
- What about her?
- She's in the hospital.

00:47.842 --> 00:49.176
She tried to kill herself.

00:49.244 --> 00:50.877
(Quinn) She was going
on and on and on

00:50.945 --> 00:52.813
about how she thought he'd come
and call her "sweet baby"

00:52.880 --> 00:53.847
and everything would be fine.

00:53.915 --> 00:54.948
What?

00:55.016 --> 00:56.383
(Voice breaking)
"Sweet baby"?

00:56.451 --> 00:59.086
I love you.

00:59.153 --> 01:01.321
You clouded my judgment!
I destroyed that girl!

01:01.388 --> 01:02.755
(Door opens)

01:02.823 --> 01:04.590
Uh, we can hear you screaming...
(Closes door)

01:04.658 --> 01:05.958
(Cyrus) Mother of God.

01:06.026 --> 01:08.794
You tell him that
he'd better hope to God

01:08.862 --> 01:12.131
Amanda Tanner doesn't want
to come forward with her story,

01:12.199 --> 01:15.967
because she just became
my client.

01:43.928 --> 01:44.729
The american people did that.

01:45.930 --> 01:47.731
Oh, honey.
I followed that election.

01:47.798 --> 01:48.765
He was a diamond in the rough

01:48.832 --> 01:50.933
before you started working
for him.

01:51.001 --> 01:52.369
You were responsible
for that photo op

with cancer,

01:53.804 --> 01:54.738

01:54.805 --> 01:55.972
The guitar.

01:56.039 --> 01:57.140
You made him.

01:57.207 --> 01:58.675
Why did you leave
the White House?

01:58.743 --> 02:00.810
No one leaves a job

I uphold the constitution

<i>you</i> are a pain in my ass.

04:05.561 --> 04:07.996
I had a search warrant
for that house,

04:08.063 --> 04:09.464
but by the time I got to use it,
there was nothing there,

04:09.532 --> 04:11.299
because your people took
whatever there was to find.

04:11.367 --> 04:12.633
Hello, David.
Good to see you.

04:12.701 --> 04:14.535
Did you get a haircut?
It's nice.

04:14.603 --> 04:15.503
Where is it, Olivia?
Where's what?

04:15.570 --> 04:16.870
The list, Olivia.

04:16.939 --> 04:18.639
I'm talking about the list
and anything else

04:18.707 --> 04:20.673
in connection with
the illegal business activities

04:20.742 --> 04:24.345
of that woman right there.

04:24.413 --> 04:26.080
I don't have any list.
No one in this office does.

04:26.148 --> 04:27.848
I can arrest her, you know?

04:27.916 --> 04:30.083
I have enough to arrest her
right here, right now.

04:30.151 --> 04:33.486
You could, but being an upholder
of the constitution,

04:33.554 --> 04:35.389
you'd need an arrest warrant,
wouldn't you?

04:35.456 --> 04:36.723
Do you have one of those?

04:36.791 --> 04:38.525
(Sighs)

04:38.592 --> 04:40.260
My white hat's bigger
than your white hat.

04:41.762 --> 04:44.763

Nice to meet you.

05:23.768 --> 05:24.601

More tea?

05:24.669 --> 05:26.070
That's very sweet of you.

05:26.137 --> 05:27.304
Stevie, you didn't tell me
you worked

05:27.372 --> 05:28.738
with so many sweet girls.

05:28.806 --> 05:31.141
You know Stephen?
Ha.

05:31.209 --> 05:33.142
Uh, we're old friends.
That's a nice word for it, "friends."

05:33.210 --> 05:34.243
Abby.

05:34.311 --> 05:36.112
Sorry.
No offense... to you.

05:36.180 --> 05:37.913
Oh, none taken.
I'm sorry. I don't...

05:37.982 --> 05:39.515
I'm new here. How do
you two know each other?

05:39.583 --> 05:40.516
Quinn.

05:40.584 --> 05:42.718
She provides whores for him.

05:44.288 --> 05:45.421
(Whispers) Yeah.

05:45.489 --> 05:48.056

06:02.805 --> 06:04.438
big day, Cyrus.

06:04.506 --> 06:05.539
A great day
for the american people.

06:05.607 --> 06:06.907
We need to talk about this.

06:06.975 --> 06:09.176
I am nominating a man
to the supreme court today...

06:09.244 --> 06:10.777
one of the finest
constitutional scholars

06:10.845 --> 06:12.179
in the country.

06:12.247 --> 06:14.715
He's gonna change
the face of american law.

06:14.782 --> 06:17.584
Did you know Keating
also has a PhD?

06:17.652 --> 06:19.686
He wrote his dissertation
on the nature of revolutions.

06:19.754 --> 06:21.087
Revolutions, Cyrus!

06:21.155 --> 06:22.455
And he likes sunsets
and long walks on the beach.

06:22.523 --> 06:23.923
He's perfect, sir.

06:23.991 --> 06:25.725
It is a great day, but we need
to talk about Olivia.

06:25.792 --> 06:26.792
We can do this another time.

06:26.860 --> 06:28.328
We're doing this now.

06:28.396 --> 06:29.862
Look...

06:31.165 --> 06:32.265
You misunderstood what you saw.

06:32.333 --> 06:34.034
(Sighs)
I did not misunderstand.

06:34.101 --> 06:35.201
(Lowered voice)
It may be a long while

06:35.269 --> 06:37.202
since I had an angry lover
on my hands,

06:37.270 --> 06:38.437
but I do remember
what it looks like.

06:38.505 --> 06:39.438
You're having an affair
with Olivia Pope.

06:39.506 --> 06:41.006
I am not having
an affair...

06:41.074 --> 06:42.841
having, had.
Don't Clinton me with words.

06:42.909 --> 06:44.576
Something happened
between you and Olivia,

06:44.644 --> 06:46.645
and something happened
between you and Amanda Tanner.

06:46.712 --> 06:48.312
I need to know
how much trouble we're in.

06:48.380 --> 06:51.917
This is not a discussion
we are going to have.

06:51.984 --> 06:55.119
Olivia is representing her.

06:57.423 --> 07:00.091
Amanda Tanner...

07:00.159 --> 07:02.560
she's now Olivia Pope's client.

07:04.896 --> 07:07.665
I'm on your side.

07:07.732 --> 07:10.000
Do you understand?

07:10.068 --> 07:11.301
I'm on your side.

07:23.647 --> 07:25.682
D.C.'s one-stop shop
for high-priced hookers.

Yesterday one of
Sharon's newest working girls...

07:27.851 --> 07:29.418
(Clicking)
Ginger bell...

07:29.486 --> 07:32.589
seriously, her real name
is Ginger Bell,

07:32.656 --> 07:34.856
like her parents didn't want her
to go to college,

07:34.924 --> 07:36.357
like they planned
for their kid to be a hooker...

07:36.425 --> 07:39.527
Ginger Bell got herself arrested
in the lobby of the hay-Adams.

07:39.596 --> 07:40.829
(Clicking)
This is her booking photo.

07:40.897 --> 07:42.030
Pretty girl.
(Camera shutter clicks)

07:42.098 --> 07:43.531
You ever sleep
with Ginger Bell, Stevie?

07:43.600 --> 07:44.933
Abby.

07:45.001 --> 07:46.868
Moving on, Ginger Bell sang
like a little bird,

07:46.936 --> 07:48.369
a bird who has sex for money,

07:48.437 --> 07:50.304
the second they locked her
in a cell.

07:50.371 --> 07:53.240
I don't blame ginger.
Really, I don't.

07:53.308 --> 07:54.809
It was her first night.

07:54.876 --> 07:55.810
The first night's always
the hardest

07:55.877 --> 07:57.377
for a girl, you know?

07:57.445 --> 07:58.846
It's the night she learns
whether or not

07:58.914 --> 08:00.414
she has what it takes.

08:00.482 --> 08:03.217
She has to put on her face
and go out into the world,

08:03.284 --> 08:04.819
sit in the bar or the lobby

08:04.886 --> 08:07.220
or wherever it is
they've decided to meet,

08:07.287 --> 08:09.089
and then she has to look him
in the eye and know

08:09.156 --> 08:10.857
that they're both in agreement

08:10.925 --> 08:13.192
that her body is worth
a certain amount of money.

08:13.260 --> 08:17.563
Of course, it's a lot of money,
but it's still a transaction,

08:17.632 --> 08:19.966
and then she has to come back
and show me what she made,

08:20.034 --> 08:22.567
so I know she can go out
again the next night

08:22.636 --> 08:23.669
and the night after that.

08:23.737 --> 08:24.870
I wiped her home computer,

08:24.938 --> 08:25.938
and I just searched
the copy I made,

08:26.006 --> 08:27.205
and there's nothing there...

08:27.273 --> 08:29.108
no names, no dates,
no tax returns.

08:29.175 --> 08:30.843
David thinks
there is a client list,

08:30.910 --> 08:32.344
and if there is one,
we need it.

08:32.410 --> 08:34.746
We may need not to use it,
but we need to know who's on it.

08:34.813 --> 08:36.649
We can't do anything for Sharon
until we know the landscape,

08:36.716 --> 08:38.850
and the landscape starts
with that list.

08:38.917 --> 08:39.884
Well, there were no records
I could see.

08:39.952 --> 08:41.184
There was nothing encrypted.

08:41.253 --> 08:42.919
Does someone like Sharon
even keep records?

08:42.988 --> 08:44.822
And that's Mason...
(Sighs)

08:44.890 --> 08:46.824
And that's Aiden
in the frog costume.

08:46.892 --> 08:48.225
Aren't they adorable?

08:48.293 --> 08:49.627
And my daughter says
they're testing

08:49.695 --> 08:51.095
well above grade level.
Okay, ma'am,

08:51.163 --> 08:53.397
I'm sure your grandkids are
great and all, but, um...

08:54.799 --> 08:56.133
Sorry.

08:56.200 --> 08:58.669
No, you're right.
I enjoy showing them off,

08:58.736 --> 09:02.539
but what you really want
to see is back here.

09:08.179 --> 09:12.347
I have them going
all the way back to 1986.

09:12.415 --> 09:15.818
A girl's first name, a date,
an amount, and a number.

09:15.886 --> 09:16.952
No Johns?

09:17.020 --> 09:18.520
Ten digits.
Telephone numbers?

09:18.588 --> 09:20.022
You're good.

09:20.090 --> 09:21.190
I try.

09:21.257 --> 09:22.391
(Huck)
Phone numbers are perfect.

09:22.458 --> 09:24.060
Put 'em
in a public records database,

09:24.127 --> 09:25.494
and it's as good as a name,
maybe better.

09:25.562 --> 09:27.896
Type in a number...

09:27.963 --> 09:29.197
And I get every man
who purchased

09:29.264 --> 09:30.598
one of Sharon's girls...
(Clicks keyboard keys)

09:30.666 --> 09:31.465
His name, his photo,
his address, how much he weighs,

09:31.533 --> 09:33.034
and if he's an organ donor.

09:33.102 --> 09:34.202

Well, I just... (Sighs)
I mean, you said yourself,

10:16.275 --> 10:18.509
she's just a girl telling lies
about the president,

10:18.577 --> 10:19.644

10:19.712 --> 10:21.046
She's not going to talk
to anybody.

You put a stop to that,
so why is she so important?

Look, I'm just saying,
I'm a lawyer, too,

10:24.951 --> 10:25.851
and I can do more
than get coffee

10:25.918 --> 10:27.352

Yeah, it's a "who's who"
of Washington.

10:41.867 --> 10:43.734
No wonder the U.S. attorney
wants to get his hands

10:43.802 --> 10:45.869

In about ten minutes,

first supreme court nominee.

{Pub}(Projector and camera shutter clicking)

for David to get
that arrest warrant.

Morning, Morris.

11:31.918 --> 11:33.553
Sorry, Ms. Pope,
but you aren't cleared.

11:33.621 --> 11:36.156
Wh-when have I ever
not been cleared?

11:36.223 --> 11:38.391
Never, till today.

I'm supposed to take
your hard pass.

11:47.200 --> 11:48.233
I'm denied?

11:48.301 --> 11:49.668
Morris, you know me.
I... (Sighs)

11:49.735 --> 11:51.036
Look, I'm sorry.

11:51.103 --> 11:52.137
You could still come in
if you had an appointment,

11:52.205 --> 11:53.438
but you...
is there a problem?

11:53.506 --> 11:55.474
Because she makes 'em go
away for a living,

11:55.542 --> 11:57.809
and she's very good.
Ms. Pope isn't on the list, sir.

11:57.877 --> 12:01.813
- What did you do now? - Don't ask. Can you get me in?
I need to talk to Cyrus.

12:01.881 --> 12:03.314
- I'll vouch for her.
- I'm sorry,

12:03.382 --> 12:04.715
but she needs an appointment,
or else I can't let her in.

So what's up?

Is she gonna be okay,

12:45.589 --> 12:47.189
Yeah, I think so.

12:47.257 --> 12:50.259
That's good, really good.

12:50.327 --> 12:52.327
She tried to kill herself?

12:52.394 --> 12:54.229
I was walking by here earlier.

12:54.296 --> 12:56.097
I saw the bandages
on her wrists.

12:56.164 --> 12:57.332
Her name's Amanda, right?

12:57.399 --> 13:00.067
She ever try anything
like this before?

(Beeping continues)

13:01.103 --> 13:02.036
Gideon?

13:02.104 --> 13:03.438
Yes.

13:03.505 --> 13:06.341
Which news outlet do you
work for?

13:06.408 --> 13:09.610
The "D.C. sun."
And who do you work for?

13:09.677 --> 13:11.211
I don't work for anyone, and I'm
not going to talk to you,

13:11.279 --> 13:12.512
and Amanda can't talk to you,

13:12.580 --> 13:13.614
because she's been
knocked out on sedatives

13:13.681 --> 13:14.781
for the past day and a half,

13:14.849 --> 13:16.182
so she can't really talk
to anyone,

13:16.251 --> 13:19.753
especially a reporter,
so you should probably go.

13:19.820 --> 13:23.089
(Beeping continues)

13:34.134 --> 13:36.168
This was our guy.
You chose this guy.

13:36.236 --> 13:37.637
He was your pick.
You loved this guy.

13:37.704 --> 13:39.238
The president loves this guy.

13:39.305 --> 13:40.872
He's Clarence darrow
for the 21st century.

13:40.939 --> 13:43.275
When he's not writing opinions
for the tenth circuit,

13:43.342 --> 13:45.410
he herds cattle
on his ranch in Wyoming.

13:45.478 --> 13:47.245
He's <i>flawless.</i>
You know how I know?

13:47.313 --> 13:48.980
We vetted him,
and we found nothing.

13:49.047 --> 13:50.415
The man is a Saint,

13:50.483 --> 13:52.049
which is why the president stood
in front of the press

13:52.117 --> 13:54.218
and nominated him to
the highest court in the land.

13:54.287 --> 13:57.087
Which I could have stopped,
if you hadn't cut off my access.

13:57.155 --> 13:59.490
You know why I cut off
your access.

13:59.557 --> 14:01.158
He's on the list, Cyrus.

14:01.225 --> 14:02.660
How did you miss this?

14:02.727 --> 14:04.861
I didn't. She's wrong.
Keating's a boy scout.

14:04.929 --> 14:06.664
Oh, come on. You and the V.P.
should be thrilled.

14:06.731 --> 14:08.231
Keating's always been
too far left

14:08.300 --> 14:09.600
for the republican base.

14:09.668 --> 14:10.967
Personally, yeah,
he wouldn't be my choice,

14:11.035 --> 14:13.403
but I'm a team player, Liv,
and so is the V.P.

14:13.470 --> 14:15.105
The manager asks you to put
a guy in, you put him in.

14:15.173 --> 14:16.907
You can't put Keating in.

14:16.974 --> 14:19.676
23 years ago, Patrick Keating
slept with a high-end hooker...

14:19.743 --> 14:20.576
Maybe we'll be fine.
More than once!

14:20.644 --> 14:22.011
Maybe we'll be fine.

14:22.078 --> 14:24.079
Confirmation hearings are
in two weeks, four tops.

14:24.147 --> 14:25.047
Maybe this won't come out.

14:25.115 --> 14:26.716
It's a dirty little secret,

14:26.784 --> 14:29.786
and dirty little secrets always
come out, don't they, Cyrus?

14:29.853 --> 14:31.688
Billy, give us a minute.

14:31.755 --> 14:34.190
No. No, no. No need.

14:34.257 --> 14:37.659
I'm going, but you need to get
yourself a backup nominee.

14:39.161 --> 14:41.396
(Door closes)

14:41.464 --> 14:43.264
Since when are you two
on opposite sides?

14:43.333 --> 14:44.232
Liv's one of us.

14:44.300 --> 14:45.867
Fix the Keating thing. Now.

like a moment with you.

15:09.490 --> 15:12.625
Please tell the president
I'm busy.

15:17.832 --> 15:19.366
Hey, I don't understand
half of this.

15:19.433 --> 15:21.067
Is this some kind of code?

15:21.134 --> 15:22.835
What does
"hardwood floors" mean?

15:22.902 --> 15:24.202
Stephen?

15:24.270 --> 15:25.471
Why would you think
that I would know?

15:25.538 --> 15:26.672
Because you frequent whores.

15:26.740 --> 15:28.306
I do not frequent...

15:28.375 --> 15:29.541
Fine. You want to know
what it means?

15:29.609 --> 15:32.177
It means there's no carpeting.

15:32.245 --> 15:33.746
Oh.

15:33.813 --> 15:35.647
To match the, uh, drapes.

15:35.715 --> 15:37.148
(Gasps) <i>Oh.</i>

15:37.216 --> 15:38.283
(Chuckles)

15:38.351 --> 15:40.418
And, uh, what about,
uh, "sunny day"?

15:40.486 --> 15:42.219
On a sunny day, you don't have
to wear a raincoat.

15:42.287 --> 15:44.255
(Gasps) Ohh.

15:44.322 --> 15:45.923
And all of the languages
these girls speak,

15:45.991 --> 15:47.091
those are all things?

15:47.158 --> 15:48.993
Yes, those are all things.

15:49.060 --> 15:51.161
So all of these girls are not
actually fluent in greek?

15:51.229 --> 15:52.597
(Both laughing)
(Olivia) Where are we?

15:52.664 --> 15:54.431
Almost done
with the list of names.

15:54.499 --> 15:56.199
Any word
from the U.S. attorney?

15:56.267 --> 15:58.234
Nothing. Maybe he couldn't
get a warrant.

15:58.302 --> 16:00.103
(Knock on door)
(Man) Police! Open up!

16:00.170 --> 16:02.372
He got a warrant.

16:06.511 --> 16:07.644
Where's my madam?

16:07.712 --> 16:09.112
Come on, David.

16:09.179 --> 16:10.346
You're after Sharon Marquette
for the publicity

16:10.414 --> 16:11.614
and for getting your name
in the paper

16:11.681 --> 16:12.948
and for upping your shot
at Attorney General

16:13.016 --> 16:14.483
the next time there's
a democrat in office.

16:14.551 --> 16:16.251
I'm after Sharon Marquette
because she's a criminal.

16:16.319 --> 16:17.420
Are you seriously

16:17.487 --> 16:18.854
the patron Saint
of streetwalkers now?

16:18.922 --> 16:20.856
Bring her out,
or I'll go in to get her.

16:20.924 --> 16:22.691
Do <i>not</i> touch her.

16:22.759 --> 16:24.092
Harrison!

16:24.160 --> 16:26.328
Go downstairs
and make sure we don't have

16:26.396 --> 16:28.362
any press waiting
to give David a photo op.

16:28.431 --> 16:29.330
On it.

16:29.398 --> 16:31.399
The madam, Olivia. Now.

16:31.467 --> 16:33.501
Abby...
(Cell phone rings)

16:33.569 --> 16:35.236
Get Sharon and Stephen.

16:35.304 --> 16:36.571
(Rings and beeps)

16:36.639 --> 16:38.306
What?

16:38.373 --> 16:39.674
Did you get a name?

16:39.742 --> 16:41.075
(Lowered voice) Gideon.

16:41.143 --> 16:43.577
His name was gideon Wallace,
and he writes for the "sun."

16:43.645 --> 16:44.678
Hold on.

16:44.746 --> 16:46.780
Don't say anything to anyone.

16:46.848 --> 16:48.782
I want a private holding cell,
no gen pop,

16:48.850 --> 16:49.716
and <i>recently</i> cleaned.

16:49.784 --> 16:50.717
(Clicks)

16:50.785 --> 16:52.285
Handcuffs?

16:52.353 --> 16:55.155
Because the nice grandma
is so dangerous.

16:55.222 --> 16:56.990
Quinn, you do not leave
her side.

16:57.058 --> 16:58.325
You do not eat.
You do not sleep.

16:58.392 --> 16:59.325
She doesn't leave your sight.

16:59.392 --> 17:00.359
Do you understand?

17:00.427 --> 17:02.328
(Sighs)
Yes. Yes, I understand.

17:02.395 --> 17:03.329
(Cell phone beeps)

17:03.396 --> 17:05.263
She doesn't leave my sight.

17:05.332 --> 17:06.632
She doesn't leave my sight.

17:06.700 --> 17:07.867
She doesn't leave my sight.
(Sighs)

17:07.935 --> 17:09.335
She doesn't leave my...

17:09.402 --> 17:11.236
(People speaking indistinctly)

17:11.304 --> 17:13.238
(Pants) Sight.

17:15.741 --> 17:16.575
We'll get you out in no time.

17:16.642 --> 17:18.777
Thank you, dear.

17:18.845 --> 17:21.646
No press, but Patrick Keating
and his wife are in the lobby

17:21.714 --> 17:22.646
with Billy chambers.

17:22.714 --> 17:24.315
They're on their way up.

17:27.487 --> 17:29.020
Olivia?

17:29.088 --> 17:30.188
I'm thinking.

17:34.860 --> 17:36.660
Harrison, put Patrick Keating
in an office far away

17:36.728 --> 17:37.761
from the board.

17:37.829 --> 17:39.363
Stephen, get Sharon out
of jail.

17:39.430 --> 17:41.431
Huck, find out who the hell
gideon Wallace is.

17:41.500 --> 17:44.735
Abby, you're with me.
All cylinders, people! Let's go!

17:51.609 --> 17:52.975
{Pub}(Lowered voice)
No. No. Absolutely no.

17:53.043 --> 17:54.311
I gave Cyrus the heads-up
because I was doing you a favor,

17:54.378 --> 17:55.679
but I don't work
at the White House anymore,

17:55.746 --> 17:57.180
and Keating is not my client.

17:57.248 --> 17:58.814
You have a problem,
you fix it yourself.

17:58.881 --> 18:01.283
(Lowered voice) Liv, it's me.
Help me out here.

18:01.351 --> 18:02.418
This is an F.O.F. favor,
by the way.

18:02.485 --> 18:04.420
Don't you
friend-of-Fitz favor me.

18:04.487 --> 18:06.288
I am telling you,
Keating is the real deal,

18:06.356 --> 18:07.723
and you're just gonna
let him go down?

18:07.790 --> 18:08.857
(Laughs)
Come on. You're the big guns.

18:08.925 --> 18:12.361
Fix it. (Chuckles)

18:12.429 --> 18:16.264
How about
a friend-of-Billy favor?

18:16.332 --> 18:18.766
Uh, Billy here tells me, uh,
there's some problem

18:18.834 --> 18:20.301
with my nomination,
and you're the only one

18:20.369 --> 18:22.503
who's qualified
to tell me about it.

18:22.571 --> 18:24.739
Mrs. Keating,
perhaps you'd like

18:24.806 --> 18:25.973
to come with me
and get a cup of coffee.

18:26.041 --> 18:27.442
She's my wife.
Anything you have to say to me,

18:27.509 --> 18:29.410
you can say to her.
I don't have secrets.

18:34.915 --> 18:37.451
Your honor, your name was
discovered on a list

18:37.518 --> 18:40.053
of our client's customers,
dating back to the early 1990s.

18:40.121 --> 18:41.421
According to her records,

18:41.489 --> 18:43.290
you visited
a prostitute named Stacey

18:43.358 --> 18:46.992
a number of times
in late 1991 and early 1992.

18:47.060 --> 18:48.927
Is this because I'm not one of
your hyperreligious whack jobs

18:48.995 --> 18:50.529
who want to overlook
the constitution

18:50.597 --> 18:51.864
in favor of whatever version
of the Bible

18:51.931 --> 18:53.299
is selling the most brimstone
this week?

18:53.367 --> 18:54.567
Patrick, don't get worked up.

18:54.635 --> 18:56.101
Sir, I know
this is a stressful process,

18:56.169 --> 18:58.237
but we are all united in trying
to get you confirmed, sir...

18:58.305 --> 18:59.472
the entire administration.

18:59.539 --> 19:01.006
You have my word on that.

19:01.074 --> 19:02.241
If my name's on a list
somewhere, I want to see it.

19:02.308 --> 19:04.208
My client's privacy
is nonnegotiable.

19:04.277 --> 19:05.543
I assure you,
the list is real, judge,

19:05.611 --> 19:07.279
and your name is on it.

19:07.346 --> 19:08.613
Well, this is just...

19:08.681 --> 19:10.214
This is a bald-faced lie.
That's what it is.

19:10.283 --> 19:12.617
Do you know what I've done
to get here,

19:12.685 --> 19:13.951
what I've had to give up?

19:14.019 --> 19:15.754
My entire career...
my entire life has been about

19:15.821 --> 19:17.255
sitting on that bench,

19:17.323 --> 19:19.222
about the law,
about following the law.

19:19.291 --> 19:20.857
I would never in...
judge, that may be true,

19:20.925 --> 19:22.459
but we need to go
into crisis mode now.

19:22.527 --> 19:24.127
My advice to you

19:24.195 --> 19:25.796
is that you pull your name
from consideration,

19:25.863 --> 19:28.299
blame it on a medical ailment
or a personal family matter,

19:28.366 --> 19:30.033
state how grateful you are
to have been chosen

19:30.101 --> 19:31.535
but that you have to withdraw.

19:31.603 --> 19:33.136
Perhaps we could sit you down
with Diane Sawyer.

19:33.204 --> 19:35.237
No, I did not do this,
and I will not lie,

19:35.306 --> 19:37.340
and I will <i>not</i> withdraw
my name.

19:37.408 --> 19:40.009
The president called me
to serve,

19:40.076 --> 19:44.246
and I will not turn my back
on my duty to my country.

19:46.249 --> 19:48.651
He didn't do this.
I <i>know</i> he didn't.

19:48.719 --> 19:50.119
Losing the nomination...
it'll kill him.

19:50.187 --> 19:52.321
Please don't let that happen.

19:54.490 --> 19:55.624
(Abby)
What does your gut say?

19:55.692 --> 19:57.659
That he's not a hooker guy
or a liar.

19:57.727 --> 19:59.461
If he says he's never heard
of Stacey, I believe him.

19:59.529 --> 20:01.330
That calls the whole list
into question.

20:01.397 --> 20:03.799
It makes sense.
Sharon's a smart lady.

20:03.866 --> 20:05.600
She's been doing this
a long time.

20:05.668 --> 20:07.835
At the end of the day,
that list is all she's got.

20:07.902 --> 20:08.836
You think she got
a little creative

20:08.903 --> 20:10.103
with the data entry?

20:10.171 --> 20:11.138
Would you blame her?

20:11.206 --> 20:12.340
(Olivia) I wouldn't,

20:12.407 --> 20:13.240
but I'm not willing
to throw away

20:13.308 --> 20:14.775
a man's entire career

20:14.843 --> 20:15.676
over a little embellishment.

20:15.744 --> 20:17.010
Track down Stacey.

20:17.078 --> 20:19.747
Find out if Keating was really
one of her Johns.

20:22.250 --> 20:25.218
(Projector and camera shutter clicking)

20:25.285 --> 20:27.053
(Camera shutter clicks)

20:27.120 --> 20:30.423
(Indistinct conversations)

20:30.491 --> 20:33.460
Well, it's not the nicest place
I've ever spent the afternoon,

20:33.527 --> 20:35.194
but it's an occupational hazard,
I guess.

20:35.262 --> 20:37.263
Well, I can get you
out of here,

20:37.331 --> 20:39.832
and I can make sure you never
have to come back here again,

20:39.899 --> 20:42.067
but you need to let me give
them your client list.

20:42.134 --> 20:44.236
No.

20:44.303 --> 20:46.304
The U.S. attorney is gonna get
his hands on it eventually,

20:46.372 --> 20:48.073
and it is
the only leverage you have.

20:48.140 --> 20:51.676
Well, maybe, but I didn't stay
out of trouble for 30 years

20:51.744 --> 20:53.678
by kissing and telling, Stevie.

20:53.746 --> 20:56.014
Nobody knows that better
than you.

20:56.082 --> 20:58.549
Your clients are all grown men.

20:58.617 --> 20:59.851
I'm a grown man.

20:59.919 --> 21:03.020
I made a choice to do
something illegal,

21:03.088 --> 21:05.622
and sometimes we have to live
with the choices we make.

21:08.159 --> 21:10.060
I was the only single mother

21:10.128 --> 21:12.763
in my daughter's
preschool class,

21:12.830 --> 21:15.732
and when she was 17
and found out what I did,

21:15.800 --> 21:19.168
what I <i>really</i> did for a living,

21:19.236 --> 21:23.039
she didn't talk to me
for ten years.

21:23.107 --> 21:25.241
Six months ago,
she calls me up and tells me

21:25.309 --> 21:28.444
I can finally meet
my grandchildren,

21:28.512 --> 21:31.214
so I know a lot about living
with my choices, Stevie.

21:31.282 --> 21:33.482
Believe me.

21:33.550 --> 21:35.850
Do you want your grandchildren
to meet you in jail?

21:35.919 --> 21:38.253
No, but the thing is,

21:38.321 --> 21:39.955
most of the men on that list...

21:40.023 --> 21:41.790
(Inhales deeply)

21:41.857 --> 21:43.892
They have grandchildren, too.

21:43.960 --> 21:46.094
(Exhales)

21:53.969 --> 21:56.237
You blocked Liv
from the White House.

21:56.305 --> 21:59.106
I did, for <i>your</i> own protection.

21:59.174 --> 22:00.975
I have the secret service,
the national guard,

22:01.043 --> 22:03.210
and some very scary
marine sentries to protect me.

22:03.278 --> 22:04.445
I think Liv can walk
through the White House

22:04.512 --> 22:05.512
without posing a danger.

22:05.580 --> 22:06.913
I don't think
Olivia is the danger.

22:06.981 --> 22:08.982
I think the person you need
protection from is you.

22:09.050 --> 22:11.617
This went up
on the "D.C. sun's" blog today.

22:11.685 --> 22:12.752
I need to know
what's going on here...

22:12.820 --> 22:14.220
the details, all the details.

22:14.288 --> 22:15.755
We're not going down
because you failed

22:15.823 --> 22:17.057
to keep your fly zipped.

22:17.124 --> 22:19.359
You work for me,
not the other way around.

22:19.427 --> 22:20.961
You work for the people,
Mr. president.

22:21.028 --> 22:22.861
I <i>am</i> the people.
You work for me.

22:22.929 --> 22:24.997
It's two sentences about
a disturbed girl.

22:25.065 --> 22:27.366
Watergate was two sentences
about a burglary.

22:27.434 --> 22:28.633
(Door opens)

22:28.701 --> 22:29.668
Hi, Cy.

22:29.735 --> 22:31.070
Mellie.

22:31.137 --> 22:32.371
Honey, are you ready
for the chancellor and his wife?

22:32.439 --> 22:34.139
Because I think
they are ready for us.

22:34.207 --> 22:35.374
Can't keep
the chancellor waiting.

22:35.442 --> 22:36.942
You can't.

22:40.145 --> 22:41.179
You look fantastic.

22:41.246 --> 22:43.481
Oh, well, thank you, kind sir.

22:43.548 --> 22:46.184
Mrs. Hanley,
where are my remarks?

22:46.251 --> 22:49.087
I'm supposed to say something
in german.

22:49.154 --> 22:50.554
Billy chambers told me
we've hit a snag

22:50.622 --> 22:51.956
in the Keating nomination.

22:52.024 --> 22:53.124
Is it serious?

22:53.192 --> 22:54.924
We don't know yet.
Could be.

22:54.993 --> 22:56.193
Well, you know
what I always say...

22:56.260 --> 22:58.195
if it's serious,
get Olivia on it.

23:01.466 --> 23:04.468
(Inhales and exhales)

23:04.535 --> 23:05.369
You're sure we're looking
for a Stacey?

23:05.436 --> 23:06.769
'Cause I don't think

23:06.837 --> 23:07.904
my favorite girl down
at Camelot's given name

23:07.972 --> 23:08.905
is Sinnamon,
if you get my drift.

23:08.973 --> 23:10.272
Sharon had some check stubs.

23:10.340 --> 23:12.108
Not everyone who worked
for her was using a pseudonym.

23:12.175 --> 23:13.242
Maybe someone kept in touch
with Stacey,

23:13.310 --> 23:15.077
knows her real name.

23:15.145 --> 23:16.145
(Panting)

23:16.213 --> 23:17.646
(Door closes)

23:20.217 --> 23:22.084
You look like
you're gonna throw up.

23:22.152 --> 23:23.119
Don't throw up in my office.

23:23.186 --> 23:24.686
I was doing a thing for Olivia,

23:24.754 --> 23:25.888
and I screwed it up.

23:25.955 --> 23:27.055
You screw up, you fix it.

23:27.123 --> 23:28.023
You're a fixer.
That's the job.

23:28.090 --> 23:29.324
I lost a person.

23:29.392 --> 23:30.758
I need you to help me
track them or hunt them

23:30.826 --> 23:32.127
or whatever it is you do
to find out where someone is,

23:32.194 --> 23:33.561
like,
right now at this instant.

23:33.629 --> 23:36.331
You try their house?

23:36.399 --> 23:38.433
Try their house.

23:42.570 --> 23:43.470
What are you doing here?

23:43.538 --> 23:45.339
(Gasps) I wasn't my fault.

23:45.407 --> 23:46.306
I went out to call you,
and when I came back,

23:46.374 --> 23:47.541
she disappeared, but it's okay,

23:47.608 --> 23:49.043
because I'm going
to her house right now,

23:49.110 --> 23:50.577
and I'm not letting her out
of my sight once I get there.

23:50.645 --> 23:52.879
Once we get there,
so I can fix this.

23:52.947 --> 23:54.881
Uh, Sharon won't give up
the list.

23:54.949 --> 23:56.783
Good.
We have a client in jail.

23:56.851 --> 23:57.851
She won't do the one thing
that can get her out of jail.

23:57.919 --> 23:59.118
How is that possibly good?

23:59.186 --> 24:01.054
If that list gets out,
Keating's ruined.

24:01.121 --> 24:02.321
Keating's not our client.

24:02.389 --> 24:03.889
Neither is the White House,
by the way.

24:03.957 --> 24:05.458
It's not your responsibility
if they look bad anymore, Liv.

24:05.526 --> 24:06.592
I don't want to see
a man's reputation destroyed

24:06.660 --> 24:08.194
over something
that is not true.

24:08.262 --> 24:10.096
Well, neither do I, but we've
already picked sides in this,

24:10.164 --> 24:12.532
and our side is sitting in a D.C. jail.
(Elevator bell dings)

24:12.599 --> 24:14.599
Good. I won't have
to walk far.

24:14.667 --> 24:16.301
Olivia Pope,
you've been served.

24:16.369 --> 24:18.203
That's a subpoena for
Sharon Marquette's client list.

24:18.271 --> 24:19.404
You have two hours
to produce it,

24:19.472 --> 24:22.174
so I'll see you in court.

24:22.241 --> 24:24.943
Going down?

24:30.564 --> 24:31.564
{Pub}It's your turn.

24:31.631 --> 24:32.398
Please, no.
I did the last one.

24:32.465 --> 24:33.699
Who would've thought

24:33.766 --> 24:35.568
ex-hookers don't like talking
about hooking?

24:35.635 --> 24:38.703
You would never pay
for sex, would you?

24:38.770 --> 24:39.804
Have you?

24:39.871 --> 24:41.306
Look, everyone pays for sex,

24:41.373 --> 24:42.273
at least until they're
in a relationship.

24:42.341 --> 24:43.474
That's how it works.

24:43.542 --> 24:44.676
I buy you dinner.
I buy you drinks.

24:44.743 --> 24:45.810
That's not out of
the goodness of my heart.

24:45.877 --> 24:46.877
Why do men do it?

24:46.945 --> 24:48.413
Honestly, to never have to have

24:48.480 --> 24:51.282
a conversation like the one
we're having right now.

24:51.350 --> 24:52.449
It's your turn.

24:52.517 --> 24:54.351
(Clears throat)

24:54.419 --> 24:55.319
(Boy speaks indistinctly)

24:55.386 --> 24:56.620
(Woman) Hey. (Chuckles)

24:56.688 --> 25:00.290
I said share.
You have had enough, mister.

25:00.358 --> 25:02.593
Inez parks?

25:02.660 --> 25:05.262
Did you ever work
for Sharon Marquette

25:05.330 --> 25:07.698
back in 1991?

25:07.765 --> 25:08.931
We're not looking for you.

25:08.998 --> 25:10.366
We're looking for a woman
named Stacey.

25:10.434 --> 25:12.901
You both worked for Sharon
at the same time.

25:12.969 --> 25:15.571
Take your brothers. Go and play
with Jane and Andy, okay?

25:15.639 --> 25:18.474
Go ahead. Mommy will be there
in just a minute.

25:18.542 --> 25:21.444
(People speaking indistinctly)

25:23.280 --> 25:25.880
What do you want to know?

25:25.948 --> 25:27.515
I'll do the talking.

25:27.583 --> 25:29.817
You just stand there.
Don't do anything.

25:29.885 --> 25:31.353
(Sighs) I could do
my job really well

25:31.420 --> 25:33.622
if you'd just tell me
what's going on.

25:33.689 --> 25:37.525
(Panting)

25:37.593 --> 25:39.127
(Knocks on door)

25:47.269 --> 25:49.403
Do you know what you did
to me the other day?

25:49.471 --> 25:52.005
Do you?

25:52.073 --> 25:54.742
You made me want to die...

25:54.809 --> 25:57.343
literally, actually die.

25:57.411 --> 25:59.712
I sliced myself open,

25:59.780 --> 26:02.715
and now you're standing
here on my doorstep,

26:02.783 --> 26:05.851
which I can only assume
is because you know

26:05.919 --> 26:07.654
I was telling the truth
about the president.

26:07.721 --> 26:10.055
That's why you're here.

26:10.123 --> 26:12.524
It's the only reason
why you could be.

26:12.592 --> 26:13.992
Amanda.
Say it.

26:14.059 --> 26:15.026
You don't...

26:15.094 --> 26:17.329
say... it.

26:17.397 --> 26:21.800
You were telling the truth
about the president.

26:23.369 --> 26:26.104
Thank you.

26:26.172 --> 26:27.939
Now get the hell away from me

26:28.007 --> 26:29.473
and leave me alone.

26:29.541 --> 26:30.508
(Door knocker rattles)

26:30.575 --> 26:32.543
You want to be left alone?

26:32.611 --> 26:35.145
A blogger posted a story
about you today...

26:35.213 --> 26:37.515
just a couple sentences,
nothing major,

26:37.582 --> 26:39.517
but someone out there
is going to follow up

26:39.584 --> 26:41.185
and want you to answer
some questions.

26:41.252 --> 26:42.620
Do you know what
you're going to say,

26:42.688 --> 26:45.154
<i>exactly</i> what
you're going to say,

26:45.222 --> 26:47.624
to <i>every</i> question,
<i>every</i> time someone calls?

26:47.692 --> 26:49.025
Because if you don't,

26:49.092 --> 26:52.061
there's gonna be more questions
from more reporters.

26:52.129 --> 26:53.797
You're going to say or do
the wrong thing.

26:53.864 --> 26:54.798
You'll get flustered.

26:54.865 --> 26:56.399
You'll get upset,

26:56.467 --> 26:58.702
and you'll say something
that will bring out the dogs,

26:58.769 --> 27:00.970
and what started out
as two sentences

27:01.038 --> 27:02.504
on a blog nobody reads

27:02.572 --> 27:05.474
is going to turn into
a full-blown tabloid scandal,

27:05.542 --> 27:09.212
and the tabloids are gonna feel
like a walk in the park

27:09.279 --> 27:10.880
once the networks pick up
the story,

27:10.948 --> 27:12.014
and they will,

27:12.082 --> 27:13.816
because this story has a scent.

27:13.884 --> 27:16.018
It smells like papers sold.

27:16.086 --> 27:17.685
It smells like ratings.

27:17.753 --> 27:19.687
Your face is going to be
on the front page

27:19.755 --> 27:22.090
of every newspaper
in the entire world,

27:22.158 --> 27:24.592
and there will be
no leaving you alone then.

27:24.660 --> 27:28.263
You will never, ever
be alone again.

27:29.531 --> 27:32.234
I made you want to die,

27:32.301 --> 27:34.601
and I'm sorry about that.

27:34.669 --> 27:35.802
I am not proud of that.

27:35.871 --> 27:37.938
I'm not, but now
I would like to help you.

27:38.006 --> 27:41.242
I <i>can</i> help you, if you let me.

27:45.313 --> 27:47.248
(Sighs)
Just leave me alone.

27:47.315 --> 27:49.883
(Lock clicks)

27:49.950 --> 27:52.218
Write your cell phone number
on here,

27:52.286 --> 27:53.452
and slide it under her door.

27:53.520 --> 27:55.221
In a few hours,
she's going to call you,

27:55.289 --> 27:56.622
and you are gonna have
to convince her

27:56.690 --> 27:58.124
to let us represent her.

27:58.192 --> 28:00.626
Wait. How do you know
she's gonna call?

28:00.694 --> 28:04.497
Because I'm
very good at my job.

28:12.171 --> 28:16.008
(Projector and camera shutter clicking)

28:16.075 --> 28:17.742
You find our Stacey?

28:17.810 --> 28:19.311
Nope, but we found
somebody that knew her.

28:19.379 --> 28:21.112
Said back in '91,

28:21.179 --> 28:22.780
she planned on moving out west
with her boyfriend...

28:22.847 --> 28:24.115
Montana, Wyoming,
one of the flyovers.

28:24.182 --> 28:25.283
(Stephen) I'm off to court.

28:25.350 --> 28:26.450
Um, you think
that Zuckerman will buy

28:26.518 --> 28:27.618
this is a fishing expedition?

28:27.685 --> 28:29.120
As a basis for quashing
the subpoena?

28:29.187 --> 28:30.221
She might.
Zuckerman's old-school.

28:30.289 --> 28:31.555
It's the best we've got.

28:31.623 --> 28:33.690
We need to keep that list
from going public.

28:33.758 --> 28:35.692
Take Harrison. He's charming.

28:35.760 --> 28:36.693
Mm.

28:36.761 --> 28:38.161
Mm.

28:38.229 --> 28:41.298
(Sighs) Ohh.
I know I shouldn't care.

28:41.365 --> 28:42.865
You should not care.

28:42.934 --> 28:44.467
You're fine with the fact that
he sleeps with prostitutes?

28:44.535 --> 28:47.269
Everybody has secrets, Abby.
Most of them aren't pretty.

28:47.337 --> 28:48.170
In our line of work,
I don't judge.

28:48.238 --> 28:49.305
Neither should you.

28:49.372 --> 28:51.240
But why does a man like that,

28:51.308 --> 28:53.375
an attractive man,
a man with nice clothes

28:53.444 --> 28:57.413
and a good job and wavy hair
and a fiancee who loves him,

28:57.481 --> 28:58.981
why does a man like that...

28:59.049 --> 29:00.182
his name is Stephen.

29:00.250 --> 29:03.117
Why does Stephen buy sex
from whores?

29:03.185 --> 29:06.822
(Laughs) I know.
I shouldn't care.

29:06.889 --> 29:08.557
Why do I care?
I'm not his wife.

29:08.624 --> 29:10.358
No, you're n...

29:14.464 --> 29:16.464
Liv?

29:16.531 --> 29:17.865
(Projector and camera shutter clicks)

29:21.570 --> 29:22.736
(Door slides open)

29:22.804 --> 29:24.271
One dozen
red velvet cupcakes...

29:24.339 --> 29:26.373
extra frosting,
like you like 'em.

29:26.441 --> 29:28.175
Of course you know cupcakes
would never work, Ms. Pope.

29:28.242 --> 29:29.810
I have a gun.
I could shoot you,

29:29.878 --> 29:31.579
but I did get a call
from Ms. hanley.

29:31.646 --> 29:33.346
The president's secretary?

29:33.413 --> 29:35.414
Apparently the president
wants you back on the list.

29:35.483 --> 29:37.049
Thank you.

29:37.117 --> 29:38.585
'Course I don't know what kind
of cupcakes you gave him.

29:47.862 --> 29:50.195
Stacey?

29:50.262 --> 29:52.498
You didn't even flinch

29:52.565 --> 29:55.033
when you found out your husband
had slept with a prostitute

29:55.101 --> 29:56.401
because it was you.

29:56.469 --> 29:58.269
You put Patrick
through law school,

29:58.337 --> 30:00.772
and you moved to Wyoming,
and his dream became your dream,

30:00.840 --> 30:02.941
and you dedicated your life
to making it real.

30:03.009 --> 30:04.476
You're Stacey.

30:04.543 --> 30:07.444
You're the reason
he's on the list.

30:14.525 --> 30:15.625
{Pub}It was my first night,

30:15.692 --> 30:19.594
and I was so, so scared.

30:19.662 --> 30:22.297
I was sitting at the bar
waiting for my date,

30:22.365 --> 30:25.133
and he was late, and I was
afraid that he wasn't coming.

30:25.201 --> 30:28.403
All the girls had told me
that there were no excuses

30:28.471 --> 30:30.338
with Sharon Marquette,
that you came back

30:30.406 --> 30:31.739
your first night out
with your money,

30:31.807 --> 30:34.042
or you were done,
and she was the best.

30:34.109 --> 30:35.842
Her girls were classy.

30:35.910 --> 30:38.612
Call girls, you know?

30:38.680 --> 30:40.447
Not whores.

30:40.515 --> 30:42.283
So I sat at the bar,

30:42.350 --> 30:44.652
and I waited,

30:44.719 --> 30:46.920
and I waited,

30:46.988 --> 30:49.523
and then Patrick came up to me.

30:49.591 --> 30:51.324
(People speaking indistinctly)

30:51.392 --> 30:52.925
(Chuleles)

30:52.993 --> 30:54.527
He could see
that I'd been stood up

30:54.595 --> 30:56.128
and that I was pretty upset
about it,

30:56.197 --> 30:58.331
and so he sat down,
and he made me laugh.

30:58.399 --> 30:59.699
(Chuckles)

30:59.766 --> 31:01.834
I had never hit it off
with somebody like that

31:01.902 --> 31:04.671
right off the bat before.

31:04.738 --> 31:07.506
He didn't know,

31:07.574 --> 31:09.074
and I wasn't going to tell him.

31:09.141 --> 31:11.009
I liked him...

31:12.312 --> 31:15.113
So I started seeing him.

31:15.181 --> 31:17.516
I-I told Sharon that
he was a client,

31:17.584 --> 31:20.018
but I paid for all
of our dates myself.

31:20.086 --> 31:21.886
You know... (Chuckles)

31:21.954 --> 31:24.922
We didn't even have sex
until our wedding night.

31:24.989 --> 31:26.156
And you never told him
the truth.

31:26.225 --> 31:27.692
Patrick would never understand.

31:27.759 --> 31:29.393
I mean, we needed the money,

31:29.461 --> 31:31.295
and... and he...
he spent every night

31:31.363 --> 31:33.264
at the law school library
studying,

31:33.332 --> 31:35.466
so I told him
that I got a second job...

31:35.534 --> 31:37.935
(Chuckles)
Working the night shift.

31:38.002 --> 31:40.737
(Chuckles) That's what
I told myself I was doing.

31:40.804 --> 31:42.872
I was
"working the night shift."

31:42.940 --> 31:45.475
It's how
we paid for Georgetown.

31:45.543 --> 31:48.211
It's how he got
where he is today.

31:50.248 --> 31:53.049
(Voice breaking)
I love that man.

31:53.117 --> 31:56.852
I just...
I can't tell him that...

31:56.919 --> 31:59.622
that his whole life was
built on a lie.

31:59.689 --> 32:01.823
(Sighs)

32:01.891 --> 32:04.493
You have a good life

32:04.561 --> 32:06.262
with a man who makes you happy,

32:06.329 --> 32:08.230
and no one lie can negate
all that,

32:08.298 --> 32:10.365
but you have to tell him...

32:16.004 --> 32:20.441
Because if he finds out
from someone who isn't you,

32:20.509 --> 32:22.910
it's going to break his heart.

32:27.983 --> 32:30.818
(All speaking inaudibly)

32:32.520 --> 32:33.821
(Projector and camera shutter click)

32:33.889 --> 32:36.223
This subpoena is
a fishing expedition,

32:36.291 --> 32:37.357
your honor, plain and simple.

32:37.425 --> 32:38.793
It's an attempt to drag
the hundreds

32:38.860 --> 32:40.527
of legal escort clients
Sharon Marquette has serviced

32:40.595 --> 32:41.662
into the mud.

32:41.729 --> 32:42.996
Name one single
prostitution case where

32:43.063 --> 32:45.031
claiming "fishing expedition"
has actually worked.

32:45.099 --> 32:46.432
Just one. I'll wait.

32:46.500 --> 32:48.034
Uh, <i>Williams vs. Pennsylvania,</i>
2007,

32:48.102 --> 32:49.869
or maybe <i>Davis vs. Florida</i>
is more your style.

32:49.937 --> 32:54.908
That was back in, uh, 1998.
I can keep going, your honor.

32:54.975 --> 32:57.010
Counsel,
approach the bench, please.

32:57.077 --> 32:58.144
(Mouths word)

33:01.948 --> 33:03.648
Are you aware
you are all grown men,

33:03.716 --> 33:05.017
and that as such, it should be

33:05.084 --> 33:06.952
at least somewhat beneath you
to waste my time

33:07.020 --> 33:09.387
on what seems to be no more
than a pissing match?

33:09.455 --> 33:10.889
We are, your honor.

33:10.957 --> 33:13.025
Well, thank God
for the little things.

33:13.092 --> 33:14.492
Mr. Finch and Mr. Wright,

33:14.560 --> 33:15.860
hand over that client list
by noon tomorrow,

33:15.961 --> 33:18.762
and, Mr. Rosen,
that woman's bail is coming do

33:18.831 --> 33:21.299
to something that wouldn't make
Donald trump feel extravagant,

33:21.366 --> 33:23.901
and let's all get back to making

33:24.970 --> 33:26.804
Thank you, gentlemen.

33:26.872 --> 33:28.339
(Lowered voice)
What do we do now?

33:28.406 --> 33:31.274
We gotta get Sharon the best
defense attorney we can find.

33:31.342 --> 33:34.277
(Projector and camera shutter clicking)

33:34.345 --> 33:35.846
(Mrs. Keating)
I didn't say that.

33:35.913 --> 33:37.647
(Lowered voice)
You did just now. You did!

33:37.715 --> 33:39.015
(Keatings arguing indistinctly)

33:39.083 --> 33:41.417
He's the perfect jurist...

33:41.485 --> 33:43.920
methodical, analytical,
nonpartisan.

33:43.988 --> 33:47.289
He lives by the letter
of the law.

33:47.357 --> 33:50.092
You chose well... (Sighs)

33:50.160 --> 33:52.294
But then you always do.

33:52.362 --> 33:55.364
He would have been
a great supreme court justice.

33:55.431 --> 33:57.032
I couldn't stop it.
It's coming out.

33:57.100 --> 33:58.600
I'll have
to find another nominee.

33:58.668 --> 34:01.737
Any suggestions?

34:01.804 --> 34:03.704
I don't work for you anymore.

34:03.772 --> 34:06.674
(Patrick) I can't look at you.
I can't touch you.

34:06.742 --> 34:08.676
You think they'll get
past this?

34:08.744 --> 34:11.445
I don't know how they can.

34:11.513 --> 34:12.914
I think...

34:12.982 --> 34:14.282
(Keatings continue
arguing indistinctly)

34:14.350 --> 34:16.150
That those two people want
to be together.

34:16.217 --> 34:18.886
(Mrs. Keating) I've always
loved you. I-I did this...

34:18.953 --> 34:20.920
I think that love,

34:20.989 --> 34:23.956
at the end of the day,

34:24.025 --> 34:25.792
is stronger than some mistake
somebody made...

34:25.860 --> 34:27.327
(Mrs. Keating) I thought that... that maybe...
(Patrick) You thought what?

34:27.395 --> 34:28.527
I could spend my whole life...
(Speaking indistinctly)

34:28.596 --> 34:31.231
Something they did
that they regret.

34:31.299 --> 34:33.100
Or... or maybe you thought
it wouldn't mean anything...

34:33.167 --> 34:35.902
I think that love allows
for forgiveness.

34:37.570 --> 34:38.905
Don't you?

34:38.972 --> 34:40.273
(Mrs. Keating, voice breaks)
Patrick.

34:40.340 --> 34:41.206
(Patrick) What, more lies?
What, more secrets?

34:41.275 --> 34:44.010
Was our whole life all lies?

34:44.077 --> 34:46.512
Don't touch me!

34:46.579 --> 34:48.947
(Mrs. Keating)
Patrick, I <i>love</i> you.

34:49.016 --> 34:52.583
I-I've always loved you.
I... did this...

34:52.650 --> 34:53.918
I have to go.

34:53.985 --> 34:54.819
Liv.
It's done.

34:54.887 --> 34:56.288
Everybody loses. Let it go.

34:56.355 --> 34:57.588
Liv, please.

34:57.656 --> 34:59.657
What do you imagine that
there is left to say?

34:59.725 --> 35:01.492
Everything.
Or nothing.

35:01.560 --> 35:03.228
(Patrick)
It's not an act of love.

35:03.296 --> 35:04.362
(Mrs. Keating, crying)
Please try to understand.

35:04.430 --> 35:05.496
I understand.

35:05.564 --> 35:07.398
I understand that
you're a liar,

35:07.465 --> 35:09.066
and that you have cost us

35:09.134 --> 35:12.403
<i>everything</i> that mattered
in this damn world!

Hey.

35:31.725 --> 35:34.159
Sometimes one gets
away from us.

35:36.796 --> 35:39.231
Think of it this way...

35:39.299 --> 35:41.166
the list gets out,

every one of these guys.

35:44.770 --> 35:46.938
Yeah.

I realize you may not be
united ideologically,

36:42.424 --> 36:45.493

a lecture,

at least some words

38:44.072 --> 38:46.573
from his majesty Cyrus Beene,
king of me.

What do you want me to say?
You won't tell me anything.

38:48.843 --> 38:50.744

you trust,
