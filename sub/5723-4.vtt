00:21.064 --> 00:22.997
Kevin?

00:28.771 --> 00:30.905
Hey. Oh, hey, big girl.

Oh, God. Oh, thank God.

Hey. Hey.

Oh, my God. Hey.

00:41.450 --> 00:42.883

- Nothing. It's okay.

00:43.252 --> 00:46.120

<i>It's okay.</i>

00:50.392 --> 00:52.059

Kev-- Kevin?

01:06.307 --> 01:08.975
Ah, fuck.

01:09.410 --> 01:11.878
- She's still not answering.
- Wait. Get in the truck.

01:18.652 --> 01:20.152
<i>Hi, this is Kevin Garvey.</i>
<i>Leave a message.</i>

01:20.587 --> 01:22.220
<i>Kevin, where are you? Your truck is here.</i>

01:22.589 --> 01:24.256
You need to call me.

01:24.624 --> 01:26.325
Don't know where you are.
You need to call me.

01:36.468 --> 01:38.536
Are you okay?

01:38.804 --> 01:40.971
Evie didn't come
home last night.

01:41.340 --> 01:44.509
She was out with her friends
and they're gone, too.

01:46.178 --> 01:47.243
Gone?

02:55.347 --> 02:57.299
_

02:57.455 --> 02:59.812
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck!

03:00.046 --> 03:01.714
No fucking cable.

03:01.882 --> 03:03.683
Fuck.

03:03.892 --> 03:05.640
_

03:11.858 --> 03:13.692
Okay.

03:14.026 --> 03:15.427
what's your emergency?

03:15.695 --> 03:18.697
Did-- did it happen again?

03:18.931 --> 03:20.365
<i>Ma'am, can you repeat--</i>

03:20.700 --> 03:23.402
I can't find my--
my boyfriend isn't here.

03:23.669 --> 03:24.936
Did it-- did it happen?

03:25.271 --> 03:26.838
<i>Ma'am, if you've
experienced the earthquake--</i>

03:27.172 --> 03:29.940
No, no,
not the fucking earthquake.

03:30.275 --> 03:32.543
Not the fucking earthquake.
Did it ha-- did--

03:32.878 --> 03:34.211
are the people gone?

03:34.413 --> 03:35.846
Are they gone?

04:23.592 --> 04:26.327

explaining to do, sport.

06:22.070 --> 06:24.738
Hey, have you seen my phone?

06:31.947 --> 06:34.448
I had cigarettes in here.

06:34.849 --> 06:37.116
Maybe you smoked them while
you were out sleepwalking.

06:39.587 --> 06:40.853
Where'd you go?

06:41.121 --> 06:44.891
I woke up in a drained pond.

06:45.292 --> 06:48.761
When I crawled out,
there was a car parked up on top.

06:49.063 --> 06:52.131
A white Mercedes. It was empty.

06:52.432 --> 06:54.232
Then I saw another car coming.

06:54.533 --> 06:57.102
It was John, the neighbor.

06:58.938 --> 07:00.706
His son was with him.

07:01.040 --> 07:03.241
I think my phone is
probably up there.

07:06.946 --> 07:08.379
They're gonna find it.

07:08.648 --> 07:09.814
I think I should tell the cops.

07:10.048 --> 07:11.448
Tell them what?

07:13.986 --> 07:16.120
You're gonna say you don't remember
anything before you woke up

07:16.622 --> 07:19.289
in the exact spot where our neighbor's
daughter and her two friends disappeared from?

07:21.960 --> 07:23.728
Wait, Evie's missing?

07:41.012 --> 07:42.512
This your truck
parked out front?

07:44.648 --> 07:46.181
Yeah.

07:46.549 --> 07:48.250
Putting together a search
and rescue out the woods.

07:48.518 --> 07:50.485
Gonna need to rig some winches.

07:50.720 --> 07:51.620
Think you can help us out?

07:53.156 --> 07:54.990
Yeah, sure.

07:57.193 --> 07:58.426
Just follow me over here.

07:58.828 --> 08:01.262
- Yes, I'll unhook my trailer over here.
- All right.

08:01.496 --> 08:02.730
- Need help?
- No.

08:02.898 --> 08:04.298
Okay.

08:08.971 --> 08:12.040
<i>This area is restricted.</i>

08:12.374 --> 08:13.841
<i>We need you to stay
behind the line.</i>

08:14.076 --> 08:16.243
Come in. Go, go.

08:16.679 --> 08:19.445
<i>- Stay</i> <i>behind the tape, please.</i>
<i>- Whoa, hold on.</i>

08:19.847 --> 08:22.182
<i>Do not park your vehicle here.</i>

08:22.550 --> 08:24.818
<i>There's a table up the
road for volunteers.</i>

08:41.001 --> 08:42.501
Jesus.

08:48.341 --> 08:50.943
You woke up down there?

08:51.111 --> 08:52.510
Yeah.

08:52.778 --> 08:54.312
I came up that embankment.

08:54.580 --> 08:56.581
That's when I saw the car.

08:56.849 --> 08:58.183
You should get down there.

08:58.617 --> 09:00.551
If someone else finds your phone,
you can say you just lost it today.

09:00.786 --> 09:02.787
That's pretty fucking smart.

09:02.955 --> 09:04.723
Thanks.

09:05.191 --> 09:07.358
You might want to start at the
car and work your way back down.

09:09.894 --> 09:11.729
- Where are you going?
- To find the girls.

09:33.117 --> 09:35.118
<i>Hey.</i> <i>Can I help you?</i>

09:37.755 --> 09:40.857
Oh, I'm part of the rescue.
I brought the winch in.

09:41.125 --> 09:42.591
- <i>Wristband.</i>
<i>- Sorry?</i>

09:42.892 --> 09:43.759
I need to scan your wristband.

09:43.993 --> 09:46.294
Oh, yeah. Of course.

09:46.662 --> 09:48.029
We had to close the park down.

09:48.297 --> 09:49.464
Make sure everyone belongs here.

09:49.832 --> 09:51.933
It says temporary,
but we just bought a house, so...

09:52.235 --> 09:53.869
They told us to keep wearing it.

09:54.137 --> 09:56.271
You bought a house? Where?

09:56.438 --> 09:58.807
Um...

09:59.008 --> 10:00.741
Uh, Stanton.

10:00.976 --> 10:03.010
You have an address?

10:03.245 --> 10:06.446
It's 41, I think.

10:06.681 --> 10:08.649
- You think?
- Yeah.

10:08.917 --> 10:12.653
Vega, that's my neighbor.

10:12.921 --> 10:14.822
Oh, yeah, sure, John.

10:15.090 --> 10:15.990
Want to give us a hand?

10:16.158 --> 10:17.623
Yeah.

10:20.861 --> 10:21.861
Take that.

10:36.214 --> 10:40.109

10:40.379 --> 10:42.214
<i>Thanks for coming out.</i>

10:42.548 --> 10:44.516
<i>We appreciate you
helping us with this.</i>

10:44.884 --> 10:47.986
You see anything that don't
belong, don't touch it.

10:48.288 --> 10:50.189
Leave a ribbon, find one of us.

10:50.389 --> 10:51.722
<i>Let's go.</i>

10:57.963 --> 11:00.965
God be in my head
and in my understanding.

11:01.300 --> 11:04.202
God be in mine eyes
and in my looking.

11:04.536 --> 11:08.071
God be at mine end
and at my departing.

11:08.372 --> 11:12.175
We are the 9,261. We are spared.

11:12.409 --> 11:16.213
We are the 9,261.

Hi.

12:01.222 --> 12:03.891
Hi.

12:04.192 --> 12:06.626
I heard about your sister.

12:07.061 --> 12:10.463
My dad and Nora went to go help,
you know, look for her.

12:10.631 --> 12:13.133
Thanks.

12:13.368 --> 12:14.868
Why are you wet?

12:17.871 --> 12:20.206
Do you know how to fix a sink?

12:28.148 --> 12:30.149
That's it.

12:30.417 --> 12:32.885
- I got it?
- Yeah.

12:33.085 --> 12:34.386
You got it.

Sorry I bothered you.
Didn't know what else to do.

12:43.930 --> 12:45.897
It's okay.

12:52.904 --> 12:54.104
What?

12:57.508 --> 12:59.643
Why aren't you with
them looking for her?

13:03.514 --> 13:05.149
I'm sorry. I'm an idiot.

13:05.450 --> 13:06.950
You don't have to answer that.

13:08.852 --> 13:10.686
My sister isn't here anymore.

13:12.156 --> 13:13.489
Where is she?

13:15.792 --> 13:17.360
When I talk about this
to people like you,

13:17.661 --> 13:19.628
they just look at
me like I'm crazy.

13:19.830 --> 13:22.031
People like me?

13:22.299 --> 13:23.632
Who don't believe in God.

13:35.144 --> 13:37.212
I think I just made your
sister uncomfortable.

13:42.784 --> 13:44.551
You don't make me
feel uncomfortable.

13:51.393 --> 13:53.294
I should get back.

14:03.170 --> 14:04.404
Thanks for saving me.

14:07.141 --> 14:08.641

14:17.850 --> 14:19.951

Hey, they're towing
the car up to Austin.

15:05.396 --> 15:06.362
Didn't find anything?

15:06.696 --> 15:08.030
Nothing came up on
the black light.

15:08.432 --> 15:10.799
They did pull a palm print
off the driver's side window.

15:10.967 --> 15:12.868
What?

15:13.270 --> 15:16.238
Yeah, the state guy said it was
too big to be one of the girls'.

15:18.741 --> 15:20.943
A palm print?

15:23.145 --> 15:24.812
Stop that! No, stop!

15:26.382 --> 15:28.015

15:29.918 --> 15:31.986
No, let them.

15:32.221 --> 15:34.122
It's just water.

16:26.772 --> 16:28.206
Any luck?

16:28.374 --> 16:30.275
No.

16:30.510 --> 16:32.543
If the phone turns up,

16:32.944 --> 16:35.045
I'll just say I dropped it today,
you know, like you said.

16:39.184 --> 16:40.851
So I should just keep looking?

16:41.153 --> 16:43.320
That's probably a good idea.

16:45.690 --> 16:47.525
Here.

16:51.328 --> 16:53.896
- Are we okay?
- Yeah, we're okay.

17:51.719 --> 17:54.921
Shit, forgot my wallet.

17:55.122 --> 17:56.855

- You don't have to do that.
- Eh, my pleasure.

Looks like you got
a fun night planned.

18:05.031 --> 18:07.299

No, uh, Nora was gonna come back,
swing around, pick me up.

22:05.825 --> 22:09.093
Hop in, man. I got you.

22:11.629 --> 22:13.163
All right.

22:42.225 --> 22:43.893
What's that?

22:45.561 --> 22:46.895
Birthday present.

22:51.901 --> 22:53.668
Feel that quake last night?

22:55.838 --> 22:58.106
- What?
- Earthquake.

22:58.340 --> 22:59.674
Did it wake you up?

22:59.976 --> 23:01.877
Oh, yeah. Yeah, that woke us.

23:05.547 --> 23:07.180
Hand me one of those.

23:14.756 --> 23:17.525
- You can help yourself.
- I'm good.

23:20.160 --> 23:21.661
Thought you didn't drink.

23:21.896 --> 23:24.263
My daughter's missing.

23:34.241 --> 23:36.575
Don't-- we live back there.

23:49.238 --> 23:51.227
_

23:55.326 --> 23:58.262
- Patrick.
- John, hey.

23:58.597 --> 24:00.965
- How you holding up?
- Open the gate, please.

24:03.168 --> 24:05.870
The natives in the camp are
restless 'cause we closed the park.

24:06.171 --> 24:07.538
You might want to
roll your window up.

24:07.739 --> 24:09.640
Will do.

24:09.908 --> 24:11.507
We're here for you, man.

24:36.833 --> 24:40.936
These fucking people wait for
weeks to get in for 10 hours

24:41.204 --> 24:43.171
just so they can buy a T-shirt.

24:45.608 --> 24:47.742
I think they're looking
for more than a T-shirt.

24:47.943 --> 24:49.944
Yeah?

24:50.212 --> 24:51.946
Well, what are you looking for?

24:54.316 --> 24:55.683
A fresh start.

24:56.051 --> 24:59.754
No, you paid $3 million for
a house that's cracking apart

25:00.155 --> 25:01.788
just so you could live on the
other side of that bridge.

25:02.123 --> 25:05.358
What you were looking
for is to feel safe.

25:05.693 --> 25:08.862
Hey,
what's going on in there?

25:09.163 --> 25:11.397
Why won't they let anybody in?

25:11.666 --> 25:13.566
What happened to you guys?!

25:13.868 --> 25:16.336
No safer here than
anywhere else.

25:18.006 --> 25:19.872
Of that I am sure.

25:23.409 --> 25:26.112
There are no
miracles in Miracle.

25:30.583 --> 25:31.984
God damn it.

25:34.921 --> 25:36.521
What's happening?

25:39.025 --> 25:41.192
Stay in the car.

25:42.361 --> 25:43.494
<i>You need to go home now.</i>

25:43.929 --> 25:46.064
No, I told you guys what I need.
Now move your damn truck.

25:46.331 --> 25:48.033
What's he doing here?

25:48.500 --> 25:50.334
<i>I asked you to go with me,</i>
<i>you said no, so he's coming.</i>

25:50.703 --> 25:53.904
- <i>Now move your truck.</i>
<i>-</i> <i>John, listen to me.</i>

25:54.172 --> 25:55.405
Isaac didn't do anything.

25:55.774 --> 25:58.241
There was a palm print on the
car that my daughter was in.

25:58.576 --> 26:01.812
Like it was left for me.
A goddamn palm print.

26:02.213 --> 26:03.714
 <i>Lucky duck.</i>

26:04.182 --> 26:06.116
<i>We have a problem.</i>
<i>Now I'm going to take</i> <i>care of it.</i>

26:06.450 --> 26:08.919
Looks like you framed
someone without even trying.

26:09.387 --> 26:11.520
<i>- Isaac didn't do anything.</i>
<i>- I don't have time.</i>

26:11.855 --> 26:14.023
- I'm not hearing that.
- Jesus, John.

26:14.257 --> 26:17.459
- <i>John!</i>
<i>- Hold on.</i>

26:21.398 --> 26:22.631
John!

26:23.901 --> 26:25.267
John, don't do this.

26:25.602 --> 26:27.069
Come on, brother,
what are you doing, huh?

26:27.303 --> 26:28.804
What are you doing?

26:52.794 --> 26:55.162
Hey, hey, what are you doing?

26:55.430 --> 26:56.697
I'm gonna go talk to somebody.

26:56.932 --> 26:58.365
- Who?
- A liar.

26:58.666 --> 27:00.300
Said he could tell
people their future.

27:00.768 --> 27:02.668
Said something bad was gonna happen
to me, now my daughter's gone.

27:02.970 --> 27:04.237
Why would he have your daughter?

27:04.571 --> 27:06.206
Well, I might have
burned down his house.

27:06.440 --> 27:08.407
You coming with me?

27:08.743 --> 27:11.211
Hey, hey!
Why'd you bring me here, man?

27:11.478 --> 27:13.613
- What?
- You picked me up.

27:13.914 --> 27:15.681
Why? 'Cause you wanted company?

27:16.083 --> 27:17.383
'Cause your friends said you
weren't thinking straight?

27:17.651 --> 27:19.017
- No.
- Well, you're not.

27:19.452 --> 27:21.653
- Let me talk to this guy.
- No, come on, man. Step aside.

27:21.855 --> 27:23.421
Hang on, hang on.

27:23.823 --> 27:25.657
You think he's gonna let you
in the door with that bat?

27:25.859 --> 27:26.859
I was a cop.

27:27.127 --> 27:29.694
- No shit.
- No shit.

27:31.597 --> 27:33.331
Look, if he knows anything
about your daughter

27:33.767 --> 27:36.000
or knows anything about these
girls, then I'll fucking know.

27:37.702 --> 27:39.336
We'll take it from there.

27:42.007 --> 27:43.975
What's his name?

27:44.276 --> 27:46.377
- Isaac.
- All right, Isaac.

27:48.147 --> 27:49.914
What room is he in?

27:50.282 --> 27:51.715
All right, so I'll go talk to Isaac.

27:51.949 --> 27:53.549
You wait here.

28:01.192 --> 28:02.759
All right.

28:02.960 --> 28:04.828
All right.

28:05.029 --> 28:06.529
Wait here.

28:09.532 --> 28:11.867
Gosh,
you sure defused that bomb.

28:12.068 --> 28:14.303
Nice work, Chief.

28:14.637 --> 28:17.539
My husband Neil-- sorry,
my ex-husband--

28:17.974 --> 28:21.376
was engaging in some pretty
suspicious texting activity

28:21.812 --> 28:25.147
and then he would leave late
at night to go to the office.

28:25.515 --> 28:28.382
"To the office."
That was the best he could do.

28:28.750 --> 28:33.521
I mean, put some fucking
originality into it, Neil.

28:33.889 --> 28:37.591
So I followed him to a
motel just like this one.

28:37.827 --> 28:39.327
Sat in the car.

28:39.661 --> 28:41.529
I watched while he
walked into the room.

28:41.897 --> 28:44.531
And I considered turning
around and going back home.

28:44.765 --> 28:47.267
I was scared, Kevin.

28:47.601 --> 28:49.937
Scared that when I caught him,
it'd be over.

28:50.171 --> 28:52.672
He would leave me.

28:52.907 --> 28:55.675
But I needed to see,

28:55.877 --> 28:57.777
<i>to know.</i>

28:58.213 --> 29:02.414
So got out of my car, walked over
to the room and I took a peek.

29:02.749 --> 29:05.784
There was Neil buck
naked and some woman.

29:06.086 --> 29:08.420
She had her shirt on.
That was it.

29:10.423 --> 29:13.759
She was taking a shit on him,
Kevin.

29:13.927 --> 29:16.262
A shit.

29:16.629 --> 29:19.030
<i>I was married to that
asshole for 17 years</i>

29:19.431 --> 29:23.501
and never once did he ask me to shit on him.

29:23.802 --> 29:25.971
Laurie ever tell you about that?

29:26.372 --> 29:28.506
- She was my shrink for a long time.
- Security.

29:28.875 --> 29:30.909
I always wondered whether
that doctor-patient

29:31.244 --> 29:32.777
confidentiality
thing was bullshit.

29:33.045 --> 29:34.544
Security.

29:34.812 --> 29:36.646
Can you please open your door?

29:40.385 --> 29:42.753
- Is Isaac here?
- Who?

29:43.088 --> 29:45.322
 <i>Open this door!</i>

29:45.723 --> 29:48.192
I know you're in there!
You used your credit card!

29:48.459 --> 29:49.793
John!

29:50.095 --> 29:52.328
Open this--

29:52.496 --> 29:54.330
Oh, shit.

30:00.271 --> 30:03.773
Let go of me!

30:04.108 --> 30:07.143
He knows where she is!
Where is she?

30:07.411 --> 30:08.843
Enough of this shit, John!

30:09.112 --> 30:11.280
Hey, relax. It's okay.

30:11.614 --> 30:12.747
Relax?
Get the fuck out of my room!

30:13.082 --> 30:14.383
You've been shot.
You've been shot.

30:14.650 --> 30:16.885
- Where is she?
- Who?

30:17.086 --> 30:18.420
My daughter.

30:21.824 --> 30:24.592
Whatever you're looking for,
it ain't here.

30:26.828 --> 30:29.596
Now get the fuck out of my room,
John Murphy.

30:29.831 --> 30:32.466
- Go.
- Let's do that.

30:32.667 --> 30:34.068
Let's go back.

30:34.303 --> 30:36.470
<i>Go.</i>

30:36.704 --> 30:38.639
Let's go.

30:38.873 --> 30:41.642
Let's go. Let's go.

30:46.347 --> 30:47.780
<i>Ain't nothing</i> <i>more dangerous</i>

30:48.115 --> 30:50.783
than a man who don't
believe in nothing.

30:57.491 --> 30:59.425
Hey.

30:59.725 --> 31:01.360
We gotta get you to a hospital,
man.

31:01.627 --> 31:03.362
- No.
- You're shot.

31:03.663 --> 31:04.863
You need to go see a doctor.

31:05.065 --> 31:07.333
No hospitals.

31:07.667 --> 31:09.868
You said before you'd
do anything to help.

31:10.070 --> 31:12.071
Well, help.

31:12.305 --> 31:14.906
Hey, I'm driving.

31:37.862 --> 31:39.997
Hey, babe.

31:41.765 --> 31:43.600
I got shot.

31:57.180 --> 31:59.148
- Hey.
- Hey.

31:59.416 --> 32:01.117
- She asleep?
- Yeah.

32:01.551 --> 32:04.653
I couldn't find the box with the
books in it, so I made up a story.

32:04.921 --> 32:06.955
Did it have a happy ending?

32:07.289 --> 32:09.124
What kind of a sick
fuck do you think I am?

32:09.358 --> 32:11.059
<i>Where's Dad?</i>

32:11.360 --> 32:13.128
He's still out there looking.

32:18.300 --> 32:20.201
You're 18, right?

32:24.305 --> 32:25.772
Close enough.

32:37.152 --> 32:39.786
Why do you think he sleepwalks?

32:39.987 --> 32:41.787
I don't know.

32:41.955 --> 32:43.989
Stress?

32:44.258 --> 32:46.459
The town was losing its shit

32:46.726 --> 32:48.961
and he was in charge.

32:49.296 --> 32:51.730
And I guess now he needs
to lose his shit, too.

32:51.998 --> 32:55.234
He's not in charge anymore.

32:55.469 --> 32:57.303
And we left town.

32:59.472 --> 33:01.839
Wherever you go, there you are.

33:06.279 --> 33:08.313
Young lady, you are wise.

33:12.818 --> 33:15.086
Michael, the boy next door...

33:17.755 --> 33:19.790
he says his sister departed.

33:19.991 --> 33:22.393
She didn't depart.

33:22.760 --> 33:24.128
- <i>How do you know that?</i>
<i>- Because I do.</i>

33:24.296 --> 33:25.829
How?

33:31.203 --> 33:34.737
Before I worked in
benefits in the DSD,

33:35.139 --> 33:38.741
they had me in the
fraudulent claims department.

33:39.210 --> 33:41.777
People who said their family members
departed so they could get a check.

33:43.514 --> 33:45.615
My beat was
secondary departures.

33:45.882 --> 33:47.917
<i>I got assigned this woman.</i>

33:48.352 --> 33:51.386
She and her husband used to walk
their dog together every morning.

33:51.721 --> 33:54.956
It was about a year and
a half after the 14th.

33:55.358 --> 33:57.692
And as they're walking out the
front door, the phone rings.

33:58.027 --> 34:00.061
So she goes back inside
and she picks it up.

34:00.396 --> 34:03.332
Talks for like 30
seconds and hangs up.

34:03.699 --> 34:06.167
When she steps back outside,
there's the dog,

34:06.535 --> 34:07.801
leash just lying on the ground,
husband's gone.

34:09.704 --> 34:12.739
So the logical explanation

34:13.141 --> 34:16.511
is that he went where 140
million other people went--

34:16.710 --> 34:19.013
into thin air.

34:26.654 --> 34:28.554
I found that fucker
in Puerto Rico.

34:32.360 --> 34:34.726
He was careful.

34:35.094 --> 34:36.663
He made small withdrawals
from their bank account

34:37.031 --> 34:38.364
for six months so he
could build a nest egg,

34:38.699 --> 34:41.266
and then he just chose
his moment and he ran.

34:43.101 --> 34:44.703
Why?

34:46.373 --> 34:47.938
Because he had the
greatest scapegoat

34:48.208 --> 34:49.841
in the history of civilization.

34:59.218 --> 35:03.020
The Sudden Departure was
a one-time-only event.

35:03.422 --> 35:06.691
The flood happened three
years ago on October 14th,

35:07.059 --> 35:10.828
and the ark took on all
the animals it needed.

35:11.197 --> 35:13.698
Why in God's name would
it take on any more?

35:48.664 --> 35:50.432
All right.

35:50.733 --> 35:51.799
Easy, easy.

35:56.272 --> 35:58.440
- Lay back. Lay back.
- Easy. Just lie back, lie back.

35:58.741 --> 36:00.408
You're all right.

36:05.114 --> 36:07.848
- What was it?
- .22 through the door.

36:08.250 --> 36:10.083
It's not that deep.
I can see the bullet.

36:10.452 --> 36:12.453
- I think I should just go.
- You're good here.

36:18.826 --> 36:20.761
- What's that?
- It's for the pain.

36:21.095 --> 36:23.863
No, no,
I don't want to be knocked out.

36:24.030 --> 36:25.665
Okay.

36:30.804 --> 36:32.004
Just relax.

36:37.010 --> 36:38.645
That's better.

36:43.683 --> 36:45.016
She knocked me out.

36:55.995 --> 36:57.961
I thought I could find her.

37:02.834 --> 37:05.536
I know. I know.

37:55.351 --> 37:56.718
I gotta go out.
Will you keep an eye on Lily?

37:56.952 --> 37:58.986
Yeah. Where are you going?

37:59.187 --> 38:00.988
Church.

38:01.390 --> 38:03.257
<i>If they asked me,</i>
<i>I'd say lean into it.</i>

38:03.559 --> 38:05.925
That's the sermon
they need to hear.

38:06.260 --> 38:09.329
These people haven't
been in this situation.

38:09.630 --> 38:12.632
I offer expertise
based on experience.

38:14.402 --> 38:16.370
But they're not gonna ask.

38:16.738 --> 38:19.673
I'll sit there while Winston
goes on about Proverbs

38:19.974 --> 38:21.940
and the congregation's
eyes glaze over.

38:23.543 --> 38:24.543
Nora.

38:24.745 --> 38:26.945
Is it real?

38:28.648 --> 38:30.549
What?

38:30.784 --> 38:32.651
Is this place real?

38:35.922 --> 38:37.823
I'm not sure I
understand the question.

38:39.725 --> 38:42.059
<i>One of the only reasons
we chose this place</i>

38:42.395 --> 38:43.828
was because you
said it was special.

38:44.129 --> 38:45.563
You told us we would
feel safe here.

38:45.998 --> 38:49.601
Now I'm waking up to fucking
earthquakes and missing teenagers.

38:50.102 --> 38:53.037
<i>My boxes aren't even unpacked and
it's the same goddamn thing I left.</i>

38:53.238 --> 38:54.972
Mary woke up.

38:55.140 --> 38:57.708
What?

38:58.009 --> 38:59.976
The very first
night we were here.

39:02.414 --> 39:06.917
I thought I was dreaming,
but she was back.

39:09.687 --> 39:11.388
I said we should
go to the hospital,

39:11.689 --> 39:13.923
but Mary,
she just wanted to talk.

39:15.659 --> 39:17.359
The last thing she
remembered was the accident,

39:17.694 --> 39:19.695
so I told her everything
that happened since.

39:31.474 --> 39:33.975
We talked for hours.

39:34.176 --> 39:36.545
And we cried.

39:40.817 --> 39:44.352
Until we fell asleep
in each other's arms.

39:51.560 --> 39:54.227
And when I woke up,
she was like this again.

40:11.178 --> 40:12.879
For some reason,
the people in this town

40:13.213 --> 40:14.881
don't want me to talk
about what happened.

40:15.182 --> 40:16.583
Maybe they don't believe me.

40:18.619 --> 40:20.119
Maybe you don't.

40:22.088 --> 40:24.690
But I got a glimpse,

40:24.891 --> 40:27.025
a moment.

40:27.460 --> 40:30.762
And every day since I've wondered
if it's ever gonna happen again.

40:31.097 --> 40:33.198
If I'll get her back
for good this time.

40:36.469 --> 40:39.236
But the one thing I've never
wondered is if it's real.

40:41.940 --> 40:43.875
It's real.

41:30.152 --> 41:31.819
You left this at our house.

41:33.022 --> 41:35.156
Thanks.

41:41.163 --> 41:42.897
What are those for?

41:43.165 --> 41:46.099
- There's one on our house, too.
- _

41:46.367 --> 41:48.468
Before park services took over,

41:48.870 --> 41:50.537
some people from the government
came by to every house

41:50.805 --> 41:52.906
to make sure it was true.

41:53.140 --> 41:55.175
That no one was gone.

41:58.813 --> 42:01.247
Oh.

42:01.515 --> 42:03.583
Do you want to come in?

42:03.850 --> 42:05.317
I can't. I'm watching Lily.

42:11.658 --> 42:13.492
You alone?

42:15.028 --> 42:16.729
Mm-hmm.

42:21.801 --> 42:23.301
Me, too.

42:43.888 --> 42:46.857
John said he burned
that guy's house down.

42:48.526 --> 42:49.994
The guy who shot him.

42:51.362 --> 42:52.963
Well,
then I guess they're even now.

42:57.367 --> 42:59.802
Burning down houses is new.

43:00.104 --> 43:01.804
Usually he just gives a warning.

43:02.039 --> 43:04.140
Warning for what?

43:06.043 --> 43:09.846
When people found out
about what happened here,

43:10.114 --> 43:12.114
there was a lot of confusion.

43:12.414 --> 43:15.250
<i>And then</i> <i>there were claims,</i>

43:15.518 --> 43:17.519
claims that were untrue.

43:18.955 --> 43:20.889
John was in at the time.

43:21.257 --> 43:24.359
But when he came home and
saw what was going on...

43:26.029 --> 43:27.462
he wasn't having it.

43:30.431 --> 43:32.199
"There are no
miracles in Miracle."

43:32.534 --> 43:34.535
- He gave you the speech?
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

43:40.142 --> 43:41.441
Evie was a miracle.

43:43.645 --> 43:45.344
She came too early.

43:45.546 --> 43:47.981
24 weeks.

43:48.482 --> 43:52.285
You know, a lot of people don't know
that twins can be born two months apart.

43:53.721 --> 43:55.254
Michael, he stayed put,

43:55.589 --> 43:59.726
but Evie,
she couldn't wait to get started.

44:01.562 --> 44:04.129
She was one pound, one ounce.

44:07.000 --> 44:08.333
Now look at her.

44:12.939 --> 44:15.540
<i>I know what people</i> <i>are saying.</i>

44:15.909 --> 44:19.543
They're saying that
something bad happened.

44:19.745 --> 44:21.979
She's...

44:22.347 --> 44:24.982
playing a joke and she's
giggling in the woods.

44:29.321 --> 44:31.322
No one would ever
want to hurt Evie.

44:34.993 --> 44:37.460
She would never want
to hurt anybody else.

44:40.598 --> 44:43.266
She's better than that.

44:43.500 --> 44:46.502
She is exceptional.

44:49.040 --> 44:50.373
<i>Exceptional.</i>

44:55.445 --> 44:57.479
Just like this town.

45:05.021 --> 45:07.022
Things are gonna change now.

45:13.496 --> 45:15.532
_

45:34.082 --> 45:36.049
I like them, the Murphys.

45:36.251 --> 45:38.018
They're exciting.

45:39.754 --> 45:41.989
And that Erika is something,
huh?

45:42.356 --> 45:45.357
Gets the call her husband's
been fucking shot.

45:45.725 --> 45:49.195
She just pulls the bullet out,
no questions asked.

45:49.529 --> 45:52.398
<i>That's real commitment.</i>
<i>That's trust.</i>

45:52.732 --> 45:55.101
<i>That's love.</i>
<i>Not like what you've got.</i>

45:55.402 --> 45:58.871
What you've got,
Kevin, isn't love.

45:59.106 --> 46:01.106
It's damage control.

46:01.440 --> 46:04.776
Your family blew up,
Nora's family blew up.

46:05.111 --> 46:07.445
And now you're all just
clinging on to each other

46:07.780 --> 46:09.714
'cause you need to
cling on to something.

46:10.016 --> 46:12.117
<i>That's why</i> <i>she bought the house.</i>

46:12.518 --> 46:14.886
<i>She didn't really care
whether you wanted to or not.</i>

46:15.121 --> 46:17.689
Her money, her choice.

46:19.524 --> 46:21.391
That must have
been emasculating.

46:21.592 --> 46:24.494
And you-- Jesus.

46:24.930 --> 46:28.165
If you loved them, you'd trust
them enough to tell them about me.

46:28.466 --> 46:30.767
If you loved them,
you wouldn't lie.

46:30.969 --> 46:32.870
Shut the fuck up!

46:35.072 --> 46:37.540
I didn't tell them about you
because you're not fucking here.

46:39.143 --> 46:41.777
I love my family.

46:41.979 --> 46:44.113
I love them.

46:45.749 --> 46:48.284
Then why did you try
to kill yourself?

46:49.954 --> 46:52.855
What?

46:53.056 --> 46:55.190
Come on.

46:55.458 --> 46:58.293
This isn't a big mystery.

46:58.594 --> 47:00.428
I was right there with you.

47:02.431 --> 47:04.833
You walked out of your house

47:05.101 --> 47:06.401
in the middle of the night

47:06.736 --> 47:09.803
and you found a rope
and a cinder block

47:10.105 --> 47:11.805
and then you tied
it to your ankle

47:12.107 --> 47:13.908
and you threw it
into a goddamn lake.

47:17.946 --> 47:19.881
<i>Let's face it, Kevin,</i>

47:20.282 --> 47:24.485
there are people who try to
commit suicide for attention.

47:26.988 --> 47:30.323
And then there are people

47:30.624 --> 47:33.293
who really want to fucking die.

47:34.661 --> 47:37.163
Like me and you.

47:42.336 --> 47:44.770
I watched you do it.

47:45.105 --> 47:47.672
And you did not hesitate,
my friend.

47:49.475 --> 47:51.010
Plunk.

47:52.812 --> 47:55.680
Right into the wet abyss.

47:57.517 --> 48:00.785
And if not for an act
of divine intervention,

48:00.986 --> 48:02.520
you'd be gone.

48:05.791 --> 48:07.892
I'm sorry, Kevin,
but these are not the actions

48:08.193 --> 48:10.194
of a man who loves his family.

48:19.670 --> 48:21.738
I don't want to kill myself.

48:24.309 --> 48:26.343
Well...

48:28.579 --> 48:30.680
you're certainly
entitled to your opinion.

48:32.917 --> 48:35.651
I'm just glad we
finally talked about it.

48:50.000 --> 48:51.967
Oh...

48:52.368 --> 48:54.902
since you didn't seem to
give a shit enough to ask me,

48:55.104 --> 48:57.072
I'll tell you.

48:57.273 --> 48:59.841
They vanished.

49:00.042 --> 49:01.709
The girls.

49:03.179 --> 49:04.980
Drove right by in their car

49:05.247 --> 49:06.281
listening to their music,

49:06.548 --> 49:08.315
not a worry in the world.

49:08.549 --> 49:11.585
Then poof, gone.

49:13.421 --> 49:15.255
Mama was right.

49:17.225 --> 49:19.626

50:51.613 --> 50:53.714
What a relief.

50:56.985 --> 50:58.553
Kevin...

50:58.853 --> 51:00.321
whatever happened
to those girls,

51:00.655 --> 51:02.557
I know you didn't have
anything to do with it.

51:05.461 --> 51:06.894
Thank you.

51:07.228 --> 51:10.697
But I can't wake up
alone like that again.

51:16.137 --> 51:18.871
I found these in the
box with your uniform.

51:25.545 --> 51:27.913

52:39.382 --> 52:41.483
Are they ever going
to find those girls?

52:46.489 --> 52:48.756
I don't think so.
