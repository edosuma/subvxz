00:04.080 --> 00:05.420
[ROSE] YOU KNOW,
IF YOU LOOK AT
THE EXPENSES,

00:05.460 --> 00:07.960
YOU'RE GOING TO SEE
THAT WE ARE WAY OVER.

00:08.000 --> 00:09.130
ARE YOU STILL WITH US, JAKE?

00:09.170 --> 00:12.470
YEAH, YOU DIVIDE
THE BIG NUMBERS ON THE TOP

00:12.510 --> 00:14.300
WITH THE LITTLE NUMBERS
ON THE BOTTOM,
I GET IT.

00:14.340 --> 00:15.930
NO, THAT'S LONG DIVISION,

00:15.970 --> 00:18.060
DEAR. UM,
THIS IS A BUDGET REPORT.

00:18.100 --> 00:19.310
AND?

00:19.350 --> 00:20.480
WE'RE IN THE RED.

00:20.520 --> 00:21.680
GOOD.

00:21.730 --> 00:23.270
RED IS BAD.

00:23.310 --> 00:26.190
JAKE, WE HAVE TO PAY
FOR THREE CARS
THAT YOU CRASHED INTO.

00:26.230 --> 00:27.770
HEY, I DIDN'T CRASH
INTO ANY CARS, OKAY?

00:27.820 --> 00:29.110
THEY CRASHED
GETTING OUT OF MY WAY, SO--

00:29.150 --> 00:32.570
AND WE SOLVED THAT CASE,
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

00:32.610 --> 00:34.160
OKAY, HOW ABOUT
REIMBURSING A WOMAN

00:34.200 --> 00:36.450
AFTER YOU
BROKE DOWN HER DOOR
AND SMASHED HER WINDOWS?

00:36.490 --> 00:37.780
THAT WAS DES'S FAULT,

00:37.830 --> 00:39.660
HE GAVE ME THE WRONG ADDRESS,
SO BILL HIM.

00:39.700 --> 00:41.450

00:42.870 --> 00:44.040
OH.

00:44.080 --> 00:45.500
POINT IS WE NEED
TO BRING IN MORE BUSINESS.

00:45.540 --> 00:46.920
A LOT MORE.

00:46.960 --> 00:48.670
FINE. I'LL BRING
MORE BUSINESS.
OR, YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:48.710 --> 00:50.590
WHY DON'T YOU TWO
BRING IN MORE BUSINESS?

00:50.630 --> 00:51.880
I HAVE TO GO.

00:55.220 --> 00:56.430
THINK HE'LL UNDERSTAND?
(DOOR CLOSES)

00:56.470 --> 00:58.140
YOU SHOULD HAVE TOLD HIM.

00:58.180 --> 01:00.270
NOT A CHANCE. LET HIM SUFFER.

01:01.060 --> 01:02.390
&lt;CROWD LAUGHING&gt;

01:04.310 --> 01:06.150
[STEELE]

JARED BOYLE,

01:07.400 --> 01:09.650
NODDED AND RELEASED
THE OIL BARON.

01:09.690 --> 01:11.610
HE WASN'T THE GUY.

01:11.650 --> 01:15.240
JARED WAS KEEPING HIS
PATHOLOGICAL CRYING IN CHECK.

01:15.280 --> 01:16.280
&lt;CROWD LAUGHING&gt;

01:16.320 --> 01:19.490
BUT HIS O.C.D.
WAS OVERPOWERING HIM.

01:19.530 --> 01:22.370
HE QUICKLY FIXED THE WRINKLE
IN THE OIL BARON'S COLLAR.

01:22.410 --> 01:23.910
&lt;CROWD LAUGHING&gt;

01:23.960 --> 01:25.870
THE ONLY CRIME
THIS BARON HAD COMMITTED

01:25.920 --> 01:27.290
WAS BEING A CUCKOLD,

01:27.330 --> 01:30.250
BUT IF HE DIDN'T KILL
THE INSURANCE MAGNATE,

01:30.300 --> 01:32.420
THEN WHO DID?

01:32.460 --> 01:34.130
HE RACED TO HIS
VINTAGE MUSCLE CAR,

01:34.170 --> 01:36.340
A SUBCONSCIOUS
PHALLIC REMINDER

01:36.380 --> 01:38.300

01:40.350 --> 01:42.470
LIKE THE CLOTHES,
THE DRINKING AND WOMANIZING,

THIS CAR WAS PART
OF AN ELABORATE DISGUISE

01:46.390 --> 01:49.730

FABRIC OF OUR HERO'S... SOUL.

01:49.770 --> 01:51.320

HE WOULD DO THIS TO ME.

02:35.400 --> 02:37.200

SO, DO YOU REALLY HAVE
A CRYING DISORDER?

I'VE NEVER HEARD OF THAT.

05:57.520 --> 05:58.730
MAN.
NO.

05:58.770 --> 06:00.360
HE'S SENSITIVE, THOUGH.

06:00.400 --> 06:03.530
LOOK, MY LAWYER DOESN'T WANT
ME TALKING TO ANYBODY,

06:03.570 --> 06:06.320
BUT WHEN THE MAN BEHIND THE KILLER CORPSE  CALLS--

06:20.290 --> 06:21.630

06:21.670 --> 06:22.800
THEY'D BE ILLEGIBLE ANYWAY.

06:22.840 --> 06:24.630
SO, VINCE,

HIS UNTIMELY DEMISE.

06:29.550 --> 06:30.430
UH,

06:31.390 --> 06:33.180
I REALLY NEEDED THE MONEY,

06:33.220 --> 06:35.390
SO, AFTER MY FIGHT,
I DIDN'T GO ANYWHERE,

06:35.430 --> 06:37.190
I WAITED AROUND AT THE GYM,

06:37.230 --> 06:39.060
KICKED DOWN THE DOOR
TO GET AT THE SAFE,

06:39.100 --> 06:40.650
MURRAY SURPRISED ME,

06:40.690 --> 06:42.060

06:43.690 --> 06:46.280
AND NOW YOU'RE FACING
MANSLAUGHTER CHARGES.

06:46.320 --> 06:48.650
WHY DID YOU PULL THE TRIGGER?

06:48.700 --> 06:51.280
SHOOT A MAN IN COLD BLOOD?

06:54.040 --> 06:55.620
BECAUSE MURRAY, HE...

06:55.660 --> 06:57.620
HE SURPRISED ME
WHEN HE COME IN.

06:57.660 --> 06:58.660
BUT WHAT WERE YOU FEELING?

06:58.710 --> 07:00.420
WHAT EMOTIONS
WERE RUNNING THROUGH YOU?

07:00.460 --> 07:02.460
HOW DID IT FEEL?

07:02.500 --> 07:03.590
SURPRISE, ANGER, JEALOUSY

07:03.630 --> 07:05.250
THAT HE HAD
THE LIFE YOU DIDN'T,

07:05.300 --> 07:07.550
COULD NEVER, HAVE?

07:07.590 --> 07:09.590
HE WAS A MAN
IN CHARGE OF HIS OWN DESTINY.

07:09.630 --> 07:10.590
YEAH, I GUESS.

07:11.590 --> 07:13.140
YEAH, NO--

07:13.180 --> 07:14.680

CRUSH IT!

07:15.970 --> 07:17.480
YEAH, NO, IT WASN'T--

07:17.520 --> 07:18.890
THANKS, THAT'S EXCELLENT,

07:18.940 --> 07:20.810
NOW, LET'S GET BACK
TO THE BEGINNING,
YOUR CHILDHOOD.

07:20.850 --> 07:22.520
WHEN DID YOU DECIDE
TO ROB THE PLACE?

07:23.560 --> 07:25.530
AFTER I LOST MY FIGHT.

07:25.570 --> 07:27.650
AFTER YOUR FIGHT
WHEN YOU DIDN'T GO ANYWHERE?

07:27.690 --> 07:29.530
THAT'S WHAT I SAID.

07:29.570 --> 07:31.530
DO YOU GOT A PROBLEM
WITH MY DICTION?

07:31.570 --> 07:33.370
NO, OF COURSE HE DOESN'T.

07:33.410 --> 07:34.410
WHERE'D YOU GET THE GUN?

07:34.910 --> 07:36.240
I HAVE A GUN.

07:36.290 --> 07:38.080
CARRY ONE AROUND WITH ME.

07:38.120 --> 07:39.290
ALWAYS.

07:39.330 --> 07:40.540
WHERE DID YOU BUY IT?

07:40.580 --> 07:43.080
YES, WHERE DID YOU
BUY THE GUN?

07:43.130 --> 07:44.630
[VINCE] THERE'S A PLACE,

07:44.670 --> 07:46.590
A GUY THAT, UH--

07:46.630 --> 07:48.010
A PLACE WITH A GUY
THAT YOU BOUGHT A GUN

07:48.050 --> 07:49.550
THAT YOU CARRY
AROUND WITH YOU ALWAYS?

07:49.590 --> 07:52.050
OR MAYBE YOU WERE
ANGRY WITH MURRAY,
YOU WANTED REVENGE,

07:52.090 --> 07:54.050
MAYBE THIS WAS PREMEDITATED

07:54.100 --> 07:57.680
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T
CONTAIN YOUR RAGE
OR DEEP-SEEDED VIOLENCE!

07:57.720 --> 07:59.140
NOT WHAT HAPPENED!

08:04.060 --> 08:05.310
WHAT IS THIS?

08:06.270 --> 08:07.400
GET OUT.

08:07.440 --> 08:08.570
YOU WANT TO SPEAK
TO MY CLIENT,

08:08.610 --> 08:09.860
CLEAR IT THROUGH ME.

08:13.740 --> 08:14.570
[STEELE] I KNEW IT.

08:14.620 --> 08:16.280
IF VINCE HAD THE GUN
BEFORE HE LOST THE CASE,

08:16.330 --> 08:18.160
THIS IS PREMEDITATED MURDER.

08:18.200 --> 08:19.450
YOU KNEW IT?

08:19.500 --> 08:21.210
YOU WOULDN'T KNOW YOUR ARSE
FROM A HOLE IN THE GROUND.

08:21.250 --> 08:22.540
STOP!

08:23.370 --> 08:25.500
I PAY YOU TO WORK THIS CASE.

08:25.540 --> 08:26.540
WE NEED TO DIG DEEPER,

08:26.590 --> 08:28.090
PUSH THE BOUNDARIES
TO FIND THE TRUTH,

08:28.130 --> 08:29.760
I THOUGHT I TAUGHT YOU THAT.

08:29.800 --> 08:31.340
TAUGHT ME?

08:31.380 --> 08:32.630
YOU SHOULD TALK
TO THE STAFF SERGEANT
IN CHARGE OF THIS CASE,

08:32.680 --> 08:33.550
FIND OUT
WHAT REALLY WENT DOWN.

08:33.590 --> 08:35.340
HOW COULD WE GET
THAT INFORMATION?

08:37.640 --> 08:38.720
LOVELY LESLIE.

08:39.350 --> 08:40.520
&lt;CHUCKLES&gt;

08:40.560 --> 08:41.930
ARE WE STILL
IN TOUCH WITH HER,

08:41.980 --> 08:44.060
OR HAS ALLISON
TAKEN CENTER STAGE?

08:44.100 --> 08:48.270
YOU KNOW, I FORGOT
WHAT A POMPOUS MOOK
YOU REALLY ARE.

08:48.320 --> 08:49.570
"MOOK"?

08:50.110 --> 08:51.690
CALL HER.

08:51.740 --> 08:53.490
[POLICEMAN] GARRISON,
CAN WE GET A PHOTO?

08:54.700 --> 08:55.620
OH, HELLO. GARRISON STEELE.

08:55.660 --> 08:56.740
NICE TO MEET YOU.

08:56.780 --> 08:58.450
OH, LET'S SEE, UH...

08:58.490 --> 08:59.700
[POLICEMAN] IF YOU DON'T MIND.

08:59.740 --> 09:00.750
&lt;DIALING&gt;

09:02.660 --> 09:04.250
&lt;CELL PHONE RINGING&gt;

09:07.250 --> 09:08.790
HEY. WHAT IS IT?

09:08.840 --> 09:10.630
OH, HEY THERE,
IS THIS A BAD TIME?

09:10.670 --> 09:13.130
UH, NO. NOT AT ALL,
JUST GETTING READY FOR WORK.

09:13.170 --> 09:14.630
HEY, YOU'RE NOT EVEN IN HERE.

09:14.680 --> 09:16.640
I MEAN, I'M SURPRISED,
I TOTALLY THOUGHT
YOU'D BE IN HERE, BUT--

09:16.680 --> 09:18.180
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

09:18.220 --> 09:20.600
JUST LOOKING FOR SOME INFO
ON A CASE I'M WORKING ON.

09:21.470 --> 09:22.560
I'M HANGING UP NOW.

09:22.600 --> 09:23.730
[JAKE] NO, NO, NO,
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

09:23.770 --> 09:25.730
LOOK, IT... I'M WORKING
THE MURRAY MURDER CASE,

09:25.770 --> 09:28.690
I JUST NEED TO KNOW
WHO THE OFFICER IN CHARGE WAS.

09:28.730 --> 09:30.230
REALLY, THAT'S WHY
YOU'RE CALLING ME?

09:30.270 --> 09:31.940
TO FIND OUT WHO WORKED
A CLOSED MURDER CASE?

09:31.980 --> 09:33.110
YOU KNOW, WHAT? FORGET IT.

09:33.150 --> 09:34.400
SAY "HI" TO THE MAYOR FOR ME.

09:34.450 --> 09:35.780
[POLICEMAN] NICE TO SEE YOU.

09:37.700 --> 09:39.240
YOU KNOW,
FOR A FLEETING MOMENT

09:39.280 --> 09:40.790
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT
HAVE MATURED,

09:40.830 --> 09:42.240
BUT NO.

09:42.290 --> 09:45.080
ALLISON, AND LESLIE
IS SO IN THE PICTURE.

09:45.120 --> 09:46.670
I THOUGHT I MADE MYSELF
VERY CLEAR,

09:46.710 --> 09:48.420
I DON'T WANT YOU
MESSING IN MY PRIVATE LIFE.

09:48.460 --> 09:50.630
YOU ARE IMMORTALIZED
IN THE FICTION OF MY NOVELS,

09:50.670 --> 09:53.630
THERE IS NO SUCH THING
AS A "PRIVATE LIFE" ANYMORE.

09:53.670 --> 09:54.760
AND, UH, YOU FORGOT
THIS INSIDE.

09:55.470 --> 09:56.760
SOME INVESTIGATOR.

09:56.800 --> 09:58.720
JARED WOULD NEVER DO THAT.

09:59.850 --> 10:01.470
JARED WOULD NEVER DO THIS.

10:04.770 --> 10:05.810
HE WILL NOW.

10:09.770 --> 10:10.820
SO, YOU SAD?

10:11.730 --> 10:12.820
WHAT?

10:12.860 --> 10:14.070
THAT YOU'RE NOT IN THE BOOK!

10:14.780 --> 10:16.070
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

10:16.110 --> 10:20.030
AND I THINK THAT THE O.C.D.
CRYING DETECTIVE

10:20.070 --> 10:21.700
COULD HAVE USED
A LOVE INTEREST.

10:23.450 --> 10:24.620
I'M HITTING
THE SHOWER, OKAY?

10:24.660 --> 10:25.750
&lt;CHUCKLES&gt; OKAY.

10:46.770 --> 10:47.730
[CARMICHAEL ON TAPE] WHO THE HELL WERE THEY?

10:47.770 --> 10:49.770
[VINCE ON TAPE] JUST SOME GUYS, A WRITER--

10:49.810 --> 10:50.860
[CARMICHAEL] YOU WANT
TO GO TO JAIL FOREVER?

10:50.900 --> 10:52.270
LOOK, WE DISCUSSED THIS.

10:52.310 --> 10:53.610
YOU TALK TO NO ONE BUT ME.

10:53.650 --> 10:54.900
STICK TO THE STORY,

10:54.940 --> 10:56.320
OTHERWISE
I'LL LET THE BOSS KNOW.

10:56.360 --> 10:57.820
I'M MEETING WITH HIM TODAY.

10:58.200 --> 10:59.530
THAT'S IT.

10:59.570 --> 11:01.120
THAT'S WHEN THEY TOOK
MY JACKET OUT OF THE ROOM.

11:01.160 --> 11:02.990
NICELY DONE.
WHO'S THIS "BOSS"?

11:03.030 --> 11:04.740
I DON'T KNOW,
BUT I'VE GOT ROSE
LOOKING INTO THE LAWYER,

11:04.790 --> 11:05.870
SEE WHO MIGHT HAVE HIRED HER.

11:05.910 --> 11:07.460
SO, WE HAVE NOTHING?

11:07.500 --> 11:08.750
LESLIE CALLED.

11:08.790 --> 11:11.130
STAFF SERGEANT BANFIELD
RAN THE MURDER CASE.

11:11.170 --> 11:12.590
SHE DOESN'T KNOW
MUCH ABOUT HIM,

11:12.630 --> 11:14.380
BUT SHE GAVE ME AN ADDRESS
WHERE HE LIKES TO HANG OUT.

11:14.420 --> 11:15.590
[STEELE] INTERESTING.

11:15.630 --> 11:18.300
LESLIE CALLED MALACHY,
AND NOT YOU.

11:18.340 --> 11:19.800
DAD, HOW WOULD YOU LIKE
TO LOOK INTO BANFIELD

11:19.840 --> 11:21.340
AND I'LL GO CHECK OUT
THE CRIME SCENE?

11:21.390 --> 11:23.680
FINE, JUST KEEP YOUR HEAD
ON STRAIGHT, RIGHT?

11:23.720 --> 11:25.350
HEY, HERE'S AN
OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU.

11:25.390 --> 11:27.930
YOU GET TO WATCH
AN EX-COP INTERROGATE
A CURRENT COP,

11:27.980 --> 11:30.900
THAT IS ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME,
BLUE-MOON STUFF.

11:30.940 --> 11:34.110
OH, NOT SO EASY TO GET RID
OF ME, JAKEY MY BOY,

11:34.150 --> 11:38.030
THE READERS LOVE IT
WHEN THE PROTAGONIST RETURNS
TO THE SCENE OF THE CRIME.

11:38.070 --> 11:39.150
I'M WITH YOU.

11:48.080 --> 11:49.370
[MAL] HEY, HOW YOU DOING?

11:52.880 --> 11:53.960
I'M GOOD.

11:54.000 --> 11:54.920
ARE YOU STAFF
SERGEANT BANFIELD?

11:54.960 --> 11:56.670
MIND IF I HAVE A WORD?

11:56.710 --> 11:58.760
-I'M--
-MALACHY DOYLE.
I KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

11:59.760 --> 12:00.840
REALLY?

12:00.880 --> 12:02.930
OH, YOU GOT A GOOD
REPUTATION AT THE STATION,

12:02.970 --> 12:05.260
BUT I'VE GOT TO WONDER,

12:05.300 --> 12:09.140
ANYONE WHO WOULD
RESORT TO BECOMING
A PRIVATE DETECTIVE?

12:09.180 --> 12:10.520
HAVE TO KEEP BUSY SOMEHOW.

12:10.560 --> 12:11.890
YEAH? SO HOW YOU
KEEPING BUSY TODAY,

12:11.940 --> 12:13.020
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

12:13.060 --> 12:14.560
I'M LOOKING INTO
THE MURRAY MURDER,

12:14.600 --> 12:16.480
AND I WAS HOPING
YOU COULD ANSWER
A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS.

12:16.520 --> 12:18.480
QUESTIONS FROM WHO?
JUST ME.

12:18.530 --> 12:20.360
I'M CURIOUS. HOW'D IT GO DOWN?

12:20.400 --> 12:22.780
SIMPLE. VINCE BRAGG
BROKE DOWN A DOOR,

12:22.820 --> 12:24.780
TRIGGERED A SILENT ALARM
ON HIS WAY TO THE SAFE,

12:24.820 --> 12:27.950
WE FOUND MURRAY DEAD,
AND VINCE HOLDING THE GUN.

12:27.990 --> 12:29.410
AND HE JUST CONFESSED?

12:29.450 --> 12:31.790
HE CONFESSED
BECAUSE HE'S GUILTY.

12:31.830 --> 12:32.920
IT'S A GOOD COLLAR.

12:32.960 --> 12:34.420
SOUNDS LIKE.

12:34.460 --> 12:37.840
DO ME A FAVOR,
AND STICK TO TAKING
DIRTY PICTURES OF OLD LADIES.

12:37.880 --> 12:40.670
LEAVE THE REAL POLICE WORK
TO THOSE OF US
ACTUALLY ON THE JOB.

12:46.140 --> 12:48.510
[CLINT] THAT'S IT, COME ON,
TAKE HIM TO THE GROUND!

12:48.560 --> 12:50.180
MORE TURNS, MORE TURNS.

12:50.220 --> 12:51.520
HOLD UP, COME ON!

12:52.940 --> 12:54.850
GO, GO! THAT'S IT. THAT'S IT.

12:56.690 --> 12:58.110
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WHAT?

12:58.150 --> 13:00.030
ALL RIGHT, GOOD, GOOD,
TAKE A BREATHER, GUYS.

13:01.900 --> 13:03.150
HEY, GUYS,

13:03.200 --> 13:04.530
CLINT WALLACE,

13:04.570 --> 13:06.280
I'M THE, UH, CO-OWNER HERE
AT CRUNCH M.M.A.,

13:06.320 --> 13:07.660
WHAT CAN I DO YOU FOR?

13:07.700 --> 13:08.910
I'M JAKE DOYLE, THIS IS...

13:09.290 --> 13:10.370
GARRISON STEELE.

13:10.410 --> 13:11.830
AND I TOO LIKE
TO THROW PUNCHES,

13:11.870 --> 13:16.000
BUT USUALLY
THEY ARE CONTAINED
WITHIN THE PAGES OF A NOVEL.

13:16.040 --> 13:18.420
OH, YEAH? ANYTHING I KNOW?

13:18.460 --> 13:22.050
OH, LET'S SEE, UH, 666 O'CLOCK, TO KILL A GHOST,

13:22.090 --> 13:23.760
INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN DEAD,

13:23.800 --> 13:24.930
TINKER TAILOR SOLDIER DEAD,

13:24.970 --> 13:26.050
DEAD MAN CRAWLING,

13:26.090 --> 13:28.510
GUILT BY INNOCENCE,
HALF PAST MURDER,

13:28.550 --> 13:29.890
KNOCK-KNOCK YOU'RE DEAD!

13:29.930 --> 13:32.140
THAT'S AMAZING!
I LOVE SOME OF THOSE.

13:32.180 --> 13:33.270
REALLY?

13:33.310 --> 13:34.890
YOU'RE A LITERARY GENIUS.

13:34.940 --> 13:36.440
YES, I KNOW.

13:36.480 --> 13:38.400
WAIT, ARE YOU HEAR TO WRITE
ABOUT MURRAY'S MURDER?

13:38.440 --> 13:39.610
I PROMISE TO BE RESPECTFUL.

13:39.650 --> 13:40.900
OH, IT'S COOL, IT'S COOL,

13:40.940 --> 13:42.030
MURRAY WOULD HAVE DUG THAT,

13:42.070 --> 13:44.110
HE WAS ALWAYS
INTO THAT KIND OF STUFF.

13:45.150 --> 13:46.660
SO, WHAT, YOU GUYS...

13:46.700 --> 13:47.870
YOU GOT SOME
QUESTIONS OR SOMETHIN'?

13:47.910 --> 13:49.240
DID MURRAY HAVE ANY ENEMIES,

13:49.280 --> 13:50.990
ANYONE WHO MIGHT WANT
TO HURT HIM?

13:51.040 --> 13:53.040
NAH, NAH, EVERYONE LOVED MURR,

13:53.080 --> 13:56.870
I MEAN, HE, UH, GAVE
A LOT OF THESE GUYS
THEIR FIRST BREAK.

13:56.920 --> 13:59.170
I DON'T KNOW ANYONE
THAT HAD A BEEF WITH MURR.

13:59.210 --> 14:00.710
WHAT ABOUT VINCE BRAGG?

14:00.750 --> 14:02.670
WELL, I DIDN'T REALLY
KNOW MUCH ABOUT HIM,

14:02.710 --> 14:04.630
I MEAN, MURRAY TRAINED VINCE.

14:05.380 --> 14:06.840
WHEN I THINK ABOUT IT,

14:06.880 --> 14:08.720
THOSE TWO DID
HAVE SOME RUN-INS.

14:08.760 --> 14:10.050
AND MURRAY WOULDN'T LET VINCE
GET IN THE RING

14:10.100 --> 14:11.140
BECAUSE HE WAS INJURED,

14:11.930 --> 14:13.020
AND VINCE WAS PISSED.

14:13.060 --> 14:14.390
&lt;CHUCKLES&gt;

14:14.430 --> 14:15.890
LOOK GUYS, I'VE GOT TO GO,
WE'RE SHORT OF TRAINERS,

14:15.930 --> 14:18.270
LOTS TO KEEP ON TOP
OF WITHOUT MURRAY,

14:18.310 --> 14:19.810
BUT YOU CALL ME
IF YOU NEED ANYTHING.

14:19.860 --> 14:21.110
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

14:21.150 --> 14:22.110
WHAT DOOR DID VINCE KICK IN?

14:22.150 --> 14:23.730
WHAT?

14:23.780 --> 14:25.150
WHAT DOOR DID VINCE KICK IN?

14:25.190 --> 14:29.280
VINCE SAID THAT, UH,
HE KICKED A DOOR IN THE NIGHT
THAT HE KILLED MURRAY.

14:29.320 --> 14:32.200
THAT ONE DOESN'T LOOK
LIKE IT'S BEEN REPAIRED,

14:32.240 --> 14:33.790
AND NEITHER DOES THIS ONE.

14:33.830 --> 14:36.120
WELL, VINCE MUST
HAVE MISSPOKE.

14:37.710 --> 14:40.580
WELL, CALL ME IF YOU GUYS
NEED ANYTHING, ALL RIGHT?

14:40.630 --> 14:42.420
ALL RIGHT, GUYS,
AGAIN FORM THE TOP.

14:42.460 --> 14:43.590
NICE GUY.

14:45.710 --> 14:46.840
[JAKE] VINCE IS LYING,

14:46.880 --> 14:48.050
THERE'S NO WAY
HE BROKE INTO THAT GYM,

14:48.090 --> 14:49.300
AT LEAST NOT
HOW HE SAID HE DID.

14:49.340 --> 14:50.430
SO, HE CONFESSED
TO THE B. AND E.

14:50.470 --> 14:51.890
TO COVER UP A PLANNED MURDER.

14:51.930 --> 14:53.010
MAYBE IT WAS BANFIELD.

14:53.060 --> 14:54.930
A COP? HE'S A JACKASS,
THAT'S FOR SURE.

14:54.970 --> 14:57.430
WAS HE TOO LAZY TO CHECK
THE FACTS TO HIS OWN CASE?

14:57.480 --> 14:58.980
YEAH, IT DOESN'T MAKE
A LOT OF SENSE,

14:59.020 --> 15:00.690
I MEAN, IT DIDN'T TAKE US
VERY LONG TO FIGURE OUT

15:00.730 --> 15:02.020
THAT VINCE'S STORY WAS BOGUS.

15:02.060 --> 15:03.270
HE'S GOT
A SLAM-DUNK CONVICTION,

15:03.320 --> 15:04.860
WHY LOOK A GIFT HORSE
IN THE MOUTH?

15:04.900 --> 15:06.400
I DON'T KNOW, FOR THE TRUTH?

15:06.440 --> 15:08.110
YOU'RE SUCH AN IDEALIST.

15:11.240 --> 15:12.320
[MAL] MAYBE BANFIELD'S DIRTY,

15:12.370 --> 15:13.490
NOT ALL COPS
ARE SQUEAKY CLEAN.

15:13.530 --> 15:14.700
HE COULD HAVE FRAMED VINCE.

15:14.740 --> 15:16.250
HOW CAN YOU FRAME
SOMEONE THAT'S CONFESSED?

15:16.290 --> 15:18.620
DAD, I TOLD YOU, HE HAS
THE DEDUCTION SKILLS OF POO.

15:18.660 --> 15:19.750
PLEASE IGNORE HIM.

15:19.790 --> 15:21.080
YOU LASH OUT
LIKE A 12 YEAR OLD GIRL,

15:21.130 --> 15:22.210
WHAT'S THE ALTERNATIVE?

15:22.250 --> 15:23.880
WHAT'S YOUR GRAND THEORY?

15:23.920 --> 15:25.340
THEY'RE BOTH LYING.

15:25.380 --> 15:27.090
WELL, THAT CAN'T BE GOOD.

15:27.130 --> 15:28.130
LOOKS LIKE WE'RE GOING
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

15:29.880 --> 15:32.430
YEP. LOOKS LIKE IT.

15:42.100 --> 15:44.520
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING, DES?

15:44.570 --> 15:45.980
PREPARING CLUES.

15:46.020 --> 15:49.070
I JUST MADE THAT,
GIVE ME MY SANDWICH.

15:49.110 --> 15:51.200
OH, SORRY BOY, I DIDN'T...

15:51.240 --> 15:52.870
[STEELE] DON'T WORRY DES,

15:52.910 --> 15:55.410
HE'S JUST TRYING
TO RE-ESTABLISH
HIS ALPHA-MALE STATUS

15:55.450 --> 15:57.120
AFTER HIS TERRITORY
WAS INVADED,

15:57.160 --> 16:00.460
I'D STAY AWAY
FROM THE CORNERS
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

16:00.500 --> 16:02.080
WELL, IT DOESN'T LOOK
LIKE ANYTHING WAS STOLEN.

16:02.120 --> 16:04.920
WHO WOULD BREAK IN
JUST TO HANG UP A CUT-OUT?

16:04.960 --> 16:06.380
A NOVEL IDEA IF YOU ASK ME.

16:06.420 --> 16:08.590
SOMEONE TRYING
TO TELL US TO STAY AWAY
FROM THE MURRAY CASE.

16:08.630 --> 16:09.920
[ROSE] YEAH,
SPEAKING OF WHICH,

16:09.970 --> 16:12.630
I'VE BEEN LOOKING INTO
VINCE'S BANK ACCOUNT,

16:12.680 --> 16:14.090
IT'S BEEN ON LIFE SUPPORT
FOR MONTHS.

16:14.140 --> 16:16.060
SO, HE DID NEED MONEY.

16:16.100 --> 16:17.970
YEAH, AND THIS IS WEIRD TOO,

16:18.020 --> 16:19.600
HE HIRES NEVE CARMICHAEL,

16:19.640 --> 16:22.770
A VERY EXPENSIVE
DEFENSE ATTORNEY,
TO REPRESENT HIM.

16:22.810 --> 16:26.270
NOW, SHE USUALLY
ONLY REPRESENTS
THE RICH AND POWERFUL.

16:26.320 --> 16:28.940
AND VINCE IS NEITHER RICH,
NOR POWERFUL.

16:28.980 --> 16:32.110
SO, THE BOSS THAT
CARMICHAEL WAS TALKING ABOUT
ON THE DICTAPHONE,

16:32.150 --> 16:34.030
THAT MUST BE
WHO'S BANKROLLING VINCE.

16:34.070 --> 16:35.570
VINCE HAS WIFE,
WE SHOULD TALK TO HER,

16:35.620 --> 16:37.410
SEE WHAT SHE THINKS
OF ALL OF THIS.

16:37.450 --> 16:39.200
MEANWHILE, WE SHOULD
REALLY GET SOME LEGAL ADVICE.

16:40.950 --> 16:42.410
OH!

16:42.460 --> 16:45.920
ANYONE HERE KNOW AN
ATTRACTIVE LAWYER MAYBE?

16:55.390 --> 16:57.260
OH, I'M GARRISON STEELE.

16:58.310 --> 17:00.180
YOU ARE DIVINE.

17:00.220 --> 17:01.730
JUST SHUT UP,
SHUT UP, SHUT UP.

17:01.770 --> 17:02.980
YOU KNOW, ONE THING
I CAN SAY FOR YOU, JAKE,

17:03.020 --> 17:04.770
YOU HAVE
EXCELLENT TASTE IN WOMEN.

17:04.810 --> 17:05.900
THANK YOU.

17:07.310 --> 17:08.860
SO, WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

17:08.900 --> 17:12.740
I JUST WANTED TO ASK YOU
ABOUT A LAWYER?

17:12.780 --> 17:15.360
HER NAME IS NEVE CARMICHAEL,
YOU EVER HEAR OF HER?

17:15.410 --> 17:16.490
[ALLISON] SHE'S A PIT BULL.

17:16.530 --> 17:18.780
SHE'S GOOD,
SHE'S NOT AS GOOD AS ME,

17:18.830 --> 17:19.910
BUT SHE'S EXPENSIVE.

17:19.950 --> 17:21.290
AND YOU KNOW ANYTHING MORE,

17:21.330 --> 17:24.540
WHO HER FRIENDS ARE PERHAPS,
AH, WHERE SHE FREQUENTS?

17:24.580 --> 17:26.170
UH, WELL, I'VE SEEN HER
AT THE PRESTON BEAN,

17:26.210 --> 17:28.460
THE RESTAURANT,
SHE LIKES TO DO
HER MEETINGS THERE.

17:28.500 --> 17:29.800
THE PRESTON BEAN.

17:29.840 --> 17:31.460
COULD YOU GIVE US
A MINUTE, PLEASE?

17:31.510 --> 17:33.130
WELL, OF COURSE, BY ALL MEANS!

17:33.170 --> 17:35.180
NOTE TO SELF,

17:36.090 --> 17:38.350
JARED LOOKED LONGINGLY

17:38.390 --> 17:40.180
AT THE BEAUTIFUL LAWYER.

17:40.220 --> 17:41.720
HIS LIFE,

17:41.770 --> 17:43.520
HIS LOVE, NOTHING COULD BE
STRAIGHTENED OUT.

17:45.140 --> 17:46.230
FORGET ABOUT HIM.

17:46.850 --> 17:48.560
HOW YOU DOING?

17:48.610 --> 17:49.940
I JUST REALLY MISS YOU.

17:51.860 --> 17:54.110
IT'S JUST...
IT ALL FEELS SO STUPID. HEH.

17:54.150 --> 17:57.450
YOUR MARITAL BLISS,
IT AIN'T ALWAYS
SO BLISSFUL, IS IT?

17:57.490 --> 17:59.370
DOES YOUR HUSBAND KNOW
THAT YOU'RE SEEING ME?

17:59.410 --> 18:01.290
I DIDN'T MEAN TO MAKE
YOUR LIFE COMPLICATED

18:01.330 --> 18:02.200
WITH ALL THIS.

18:02.240 --> 18:04.200
HE'S MY HUSBAND. I SHOULD TRY!

18:05.370 --> 18:07.120
GIVE IT A CHANCE,

18:07.170 --> 18:09.960
YOU KNOW,
LET IT PLAY ITSELF OUT, RIGHT?

18:10.000 --> 18:12.630
SOME PURELY NON
SELF-INTERESTED ADVICE HERE?

18:13.630 --> 18:16.050
IF IT ENDED, IT WAS
PROBABLY SUPPOSED TO.

18:16.090 --> 18:17.840
A LOT OF PEOPLE
SPEND A LOT OF MONEY
AND A LOT OF TIME

18:17.890 --> 18:19.340
TRYING TO FIGURE THAT OUT.

18:19.390 --> 18:20.760
MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

18:20.800 --> 18:22.760
OR MAYBE I'M THE LAST
PERSON IN THE WORLD

18:22.810 --> 18:24.850
WHO SHOULD BE GIVING
RELATIONSHIP ADVICE, SO...

18:25.560 --> 18:26.850
I'VE GOT TO GO.

18:28.230 --> 18:29.190
NICE SEEING YOU.

18:38.240 --> 18:39.410
&lt;CAR ENGINE STARTS&gt;

18:44.290 --> 18:45.540
WHERE'S YOUR CAR?

18:46.200 --> 18:47.290
OH, S--

18:50.460 --> 18:53.210
[STEELE] HERE'S
MY YACHT NUMBER,

18:53.250 --> 18:56.470
MY HOME NUMBER, AND MY MOBILE.

18:56.510 --> 18:59.890
FEEL FREE TO CALL ME
ANY TIME OF DAY OR NIGHT,

19:00.550 --> 19:02.260
AND ANOTHER DRINK, PLEASE.

19:02.300 --> 19:04.140
DON'T WORRY,
I WON'T BE DRIVING!

19:05.310 --> 19:06.310
DO YOU EVEN HAVE YOUR LICENSE?

19:06.350 --> 19:08.140
SEE, THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM.

19:08.190 --> 19:09.730
YOU DON'T TRUST ANYONE,

19:09.770 --> 19:11.810
SAME FOR ALLISON AND LESLIE.

19:11.860 --> 19:14.190
OH, MY GOD, YOU NEVER,
EVER SHUT UP, DO YOU?

19:14.230 --> 19:15.730
WHY COMPLICATE YOUR LIFE
WITH TWO WOMEN

19:15.780 --> 19:17.900
WHEN YOU'RE REALLY IN LOVE
WITH ONE OF THEM?

19:17.950 --> 19:20.820
AND WE ALL KNOW WHICH ONE
YOU'RE REALLY IN LOVE WITH.

19:20.860 --> 19:22.070
WHICH ONE AM I
REALLY IN LOVE WITH?

19:22.120 --> 19:23.280
I'D LOVE TO HEAR IT FROM YOU.

19:23.330 --> 19:24.450
SEE, THERE YOU GO AGAIN,

19:24.490 --> 19:26.540
TERRIFIED TO ADMIT THE TRUTH.

19:26.580 --> 19:28.040
YOU DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT ME,

19:28.080 --> 19:29.580
AND YOU DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT HOW I FEEL,

19:29.620 --> 19:32.040
SO WHY DON'T YOU DO US ALL
A GREAT BIG FAVOR

19:32.080 --> 19:33.420
AND TAKE A VACATION
SOMEWHERE ELSE.

19:33.460 --> 19:35.090
PLEASE KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN.

19:35.130 --> 19:37.170
LOOK WHO'S LUNCHING
OVER THERE.

19:37.210 --> 19:38.470
[JAKE] IS THAT NEVE
THE LAWYER WITH--

19:38.510 --> 19:40.340
[STEELE] CLINT. THE BOSS.

19:40.380 --> 19:43.890
MURRAY'S PARTNER.
MY GUESS IS CLINT IS PAYING
VINCE'S LEGAL FEES.

19:43.930 --> 19:45.350
WHY WOULD HE BE PAYING
FOR HIS LEGAL FEES?

19:45.390 --> 19:48.520
THANK YOU.
EXCELLENT QUESTION, JARED.

19:51.350 --> 19:52.650
GOOD AFTERNOON.

19:52.690 --> 19:55.150
THE DEAD MURRAY ON YOUR MINDS?

19:55.190 --> 19:57.360
OR VINCE, THE MAN
ACCUSED OF KILLING HIM.

19:57.400 --> 19:59.440
MR. STEELE,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

19:59.490 --> 20:01.660
GETTING TO THE TRUTH,
WHILE WRITING A NOVEL.

20:01.700 --> 20:03.240
EXCUSE ME?

20:03.280 --> 20:04.410
I'M REALLY, REALLY VERY SORRY.

20:04.450 --> 20:05.910
[STEELE] YOU'RE
NEVE CARMICHAEL,

20:05.950 --> 20:07.790
THE LAWYER FOR THE MAN
WHO KILLED MURRAY.

20:07.830 --> 20:09.040
UH, CLINT,

20:09.080 --> 20:11.330
ARE YOU PAYING
VINCE'S LEGAL FEES? WHY?

20:11.370 --> 20:13.290
CLINT. YOU DON'T HAVE TO
ANSWER ANY OF THESE QUESTIONS.

20:13.330 --> 20:15.840
IN MY BOOK,
THE ADVOCATE'S ADVOCATE,

20:15.880 --> 20:17.460
THE PROTAGONIST IS THE LAWYER
FOR A SEX RING,

20:17.500 --> 20:20.220
BUT IT TURNS OUT
HE'S ACTUALLY
CONSPIRING WITH THEM

20:20.260 --> 20:21.380
TO COMMIT MURDER.

20:21.430 --> 20:23.890
SEE, HE ACTUALLY HAS A HABIT
OF DOING THIS KIND OF THING.

20:23.930 --> 20:26.100
SO, WHAT ARE YOU INSINUATING?

20:26.140 --> 20:28.140
NO, NO, GUYS, COME ON.

20:28.180 --> 20:29.430
THAT'S NOT
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE AT ALL.

20:29.470 --> 20:30.850
[JAKE] REALLY?

20:30.890 --> 20:32.730
THEN ENLIGHTEN US,
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?

20:32.770 --> 20:34.860
WELL, THE TRUTH IS,

20:34.900 --> 20:36.270
I FELT BAD FOR VINCE.

20:36.310 --> 20:38.480
LOOK, BOTH MURR AND I MADE
A LOT OF COIN OFF HIM

20:38.530 --> 20:39.400
BEFORE HE GOT INJURED,

20:39.440 --> 20:41.950
SO I THOUGHT
I'D GIVE SOMETHING BACK.

20:41.990 --> 20:43.860
YOU TOLD US
YOU DIDN'T KNOW VINCE.

20:43.910 --> 20:45.070
WELL, I DON'T.

20:45.120 --> 20:46.490
NOT PERSONALLY,

20:46.530 --> 20:49.330
BUT I KNOW WHAT MURRAY
WOULD WANT,
AND IF IT WAS AN ACCIDENT,

20:49.370 --> 20:53.170
HE WOULDN'T WANT
HIS FRIEND LOCKED UP
IN JAIL FOREVER, RIGHT?

20:53.210 --> 20:56.670
NOW, IF YOU'D PLEASE,
UH, EXCUSE US?

20:59.670 --> 21:00.710
BON APPETIT.

21:04.380 --> 21:06.180
NICE TO SEE YOU.

21:06.220 --> 21:07.510
ENJOY YOUR LUNCH.

21:07.550 --> 21:09.390
[KELSEY] HIS NAME IS NICO.

21:09.430 --> 21:10.930
WE WERE SO HAPPY
TO BRING HIM HOME,

21:12.180 --> 21:13.980
IT SEEMS SO LONG AGO NOW.

21:14.020 --> 21:16.060
OH, YOU ALL LOOK SO BEAUTIFUL.

21:16.100 --> 21:17.310
THAT'S SWEET OF YOU.

21:17.360 --> 21:18.940
HE'S WITH A FRIEND FROM WORK.

21:18.980 --> 21:23.280
I HAVEN'T GOT MUCH TIME TO
MYSELF SINCE VINCE'S ARREST.

21:23.320 --> 21:25.280
[MAL] DON'T APOLOGIZE,
AND THANK YOU FOR SEEING US.

21:26.410 --> 21:28.030
SO, WHAT CAN I DO TO HELP YOU?

21:28.080 --> 21:29.950
WELL, WE'RE LOOKING
INTO VINCE'S CASE.

21:29.990 --> 21:32.910
IS IT TRUE THAT
GARRISON STEELE IS WRITING
A BOOK ABOUT MY HUSBAND?

21:32.950 --> 21:34.460
YES IT IS, BUT HE'S--

21:34.500 --> 21:36.170
WELL, WE'RE,
WE WANT TO FIND OUT THE TRUTH,

21:36.210 --> 21:37.670
SEE IF WE CAN HELP
VINCE OUT SOMEHOW.

21:37.710 --> 21:39.920
WE'VE BEEN LOOKING INTO
MURRAY'S DEATH AND THE FACTS,

21:40.960 --> 21:42.760
AND SOMETHING ISN'T LINING UP.

21:44.220 --> 21:45.380
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I CAN DO TO HELP YOU,

21:45.430 --> 21:46.970
I MEAN... I MEAN,

21:47.010 --> 21:48.760
I NEVER THOUGHT VINCE WAS...

21:48.800 --> 21:51.060
COULD KILL ANYONE,
LEAST OF ALL A FRIEND,

21:51.100 --> 21:53.310
BUT HE CONFESSED, AND...

21:54.430 --> 21:56.230
WE'RE HERE TO HELP VINCE,

21:56.270 --> 21:58.190
SO IF THERE'S
ANYTHING YOU KNOW,

21:59.270 --> 22:00.610
ANYTHING YOU'RE
NOT TELLING US.

22:02.730 --> 22:04.070
YOU'RE GOOD PEOPLE, RIGHT?

22:05.700 --> 22:07.280
I CAN TRUST YOU?

22:08.530 --> 22:10.410
I MEAN, I FEEL LIKE
I CAN TRUST YOU.

22:10.450 --> 22:11.700
'COURSE YOU CAN.

22:11.740 --> 22:13.080
WHAT IS IT, HONEY?

22:19.840 --> 22:22.710
IT'S $50,000 EXACTLY.

22:23.510 --> 22:25.170
I COUNTED.

22:25.220 --> 22:27.180
I DON'T KNOW WHERE IT'S FROM,
BUT I THINK...

22:28.260 --> 22:30.430
I THINK MY HUSBAND WAS PAID
TO KILL MURRAY.

22:37.100 --> 22:39.100
[JAKE] SO, WHAT?

22:39.150 --> 22:40.860
CLINT IS JUST PAYING
FOR VINCE'S LEGAL FEES

22:40.900 --> 22:42.070
OUT OF THE GOODNESS
OF HIS HEART?

22:42.110 --> 22:43.530
[STEELE] IT'LL MAKE
A GREAT CHAPTER,

22:43.570 --> 22:44.610
"I KNOW WHAT
MURRAY WOULD WANT,

22:44.650 --> 22:46.150
"AND HE WOULDN'T WANT
TO SEE ONE OF HIS FRIENDS

22:46.190 --> 22:47.610
"LOCKED IN JAIL FOREVER",

22:47.650 --> 22:48.910
&lt;CELL PHONE RINGING&gt;
HEARTSTRINGS!

22:50.740 --> 22:51.830
DAD.

22:51.870 --> 22:53.370
SPEAKERPHONE, PLEASE.

22:53.410 --> 22:54.580
HOLD ON FOR A SECOND.

22:54.620 --> 22:56.960
KELSEY, VINCE'S WIFE,
FOUND 50 GRAND

22:57.000 --> 22:59.080
AFTER VINCE WAS ARRESTED
FOR MURRAY'S MURDER.

22:59.120 --> 23:00.460
IT WAS MURDER FOR HIRE.

23:00.500 --> 23:02.380
[MAL] THAT'S
THE WORKING THEORY.

23:02.420 --> 23:03.920
SO, VINCE WAS PAID 50 GRAND
TO MURDER MURRAY,

23:03.960 --> 23:05.510
GOT CAUGHT,

23:05.550 --> 23:08.430
AND CONFESSED TO ROBBERY
AND MANSLAUGHTER INSTEAD
TO SERVE LESS TIME.

23:08.470 --> 23:11.090
THAT IS LIKE, THE WORST
HIT JOB I'VE EVER HEARD OF.

23:11.140 --> 23:12.600
HE GETS PAID 50 GRAND
TO KILL A GUY

23:12.640 --> 23:14.100
AND THEN HE CONFESSES TO IT?

23:14.140 --> 23:15.560
BUT WHO PAID VINCE
THE $50,000?

23:15.600 --> 23:17.430
WHY DON'T YOU GUYS
GET BACK HERE,

23:17.480 --> 23:18.980
WE'LL FIGURE OUT
OUR NEXT MOVE.

23:19.020 --> 23:20.440
AYE-AYE, SKIPPER.

23:20.480 --> 23:21.440
&lt;CELL PHONE RINGING&gt;

23:21.480 --> 23:22.650
OH! MY PUBLISHER,

23:22.690 --> 23:24.070
OBVIOUSLY WONDERING ABOUT
THE NEW BEST SELLER.

23:24.110 --> 23:26.530
NOW WHO'S AVOIDING THINGS?

23:26.570 --> 23:28.570
EVERY TIME
THAT WOMAN CALLS YOU,
YOU PRESS IGNORE.

23:28.610 --> 23:30.110
WHY?
&lt;TIRES SCREECHING&gt;

23:31.280 --> 23:32.870
FRIEND OF YOURS?

23:34.620 --> 23:36.790
STAFF SERGEANT
BANFIELD, RIGHT?

23:36.830 --> 23:39.540
I TOLD YOUR FATHER TO STAY OUT
OF THE MURRAY CASE.

23:39.580 --> 23:41.040
LOOK BUDDY, WHAT CAN I DO?

23:41.080 --> 23:42.710
MY DAD'S
A TERRIBLE COMMUNICATOR.

23:42.750 --> 23:44.630
OH, YEAH?
MAYBE I CAN HELP.

23:46.630 --> 23:47.800
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

23:47.840 --> 23:49.170
WHAT? OH!

23:49.220 --> 23:50.300
WE'RE NOT STOPPING.

23:50.340 --> 23:51.470
STEELE, WOULD YOU-- OH!

23:51.510 --> 23:52.590
NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO.

23:52.640 --> 23:54.550
WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG-- AH!

23:54.600 --> 23:55.890
WE'RE GETTING
TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS.

23:55.930 --> 23:57.020
SHUT UP!

23:57.060 --> 23:58.890
STAY OUT OF IT, OR NEXT TIME,

23:58.930 --> 24:00.850
IT WON'T BE A CARDBOARD
CUT-OUT HANGING
FROM YOUR CEILING.

24:05.360 --> 24:07.610
AH. LET GO OF ME.

24:07.650 --> 24:09.530
NOW, THAT'S HOW
YOU END A CHAPTER.

24:10.610 --> 24:12.110
&lt;TIRES SCREECHING&gt;

24:16.280 --> 24:17.410
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

24:17.450 --> 24:18.620
[JAKE] IT'S A LONG STORY,

24:18.660 --> 24:20.710
BUT I'M PRETTY SURE BANFIELD

24:20.750 --> 24:22.830
DOESN'T WANT US LOOKING
INTO THIS MURRAY MURDER.

24:22.870 --> 24:24.540
MY GUESS IS HE PAID
VINCE THE 50 GRAND

24:24.580 --> 24:26.130
TO WHACK MURRAY.

24:26.170 --> 24:27.420
OKAY, WHERE WOULD
A COP GET 50 GRAND,

24:27.460 --> 24:28.510
AND WHY WOULD HE WHACK ANYONE?

24:28.550 --> 24:30.050
WELL, HE DESTROYED MY CUT-OUT,

24:30.090 --> 24:31.550
SO OBVIOUSLY
HE'S GUILTY OF SOMETHING.

24:31.590 --> 24:33.680
DAD, JUST IGNORE HIM,
ALL RIGHT?

24:33.720 --> 24:34.970
SOMEONE PAID VINCE
TO KILL MURRAY.

24:35.010 --> 24:36.600
CLINT, OR BANFIELD?

24:37.470 --> 24:38.720
HARD TO SAY.

24:38.770 --> 24:40.140
NEITHER OF THEM HAS A MOTIVE.

24:40.180 --> 24:42.060
YEAH, MAYBE WE SHOULD TAKE
A CLOSER LOOK AT BOTH OF THEM.

24:44.560 --> 24:46.520
YOU TAKE CLINT,
AND I'LL TAKE BANFIELD.

25:31.110 --> 25:32.280
ANYTHING INTERESTING AT ALL?

25:32.320 --> 25:33.570
NO, NOTHING MUCH,

25:33.610 --> 25:35.740
JUST A COUPLE OF FIGHTERS
CAME IN AND THAT'S IT.

25:35.780 --> 25:36.700
&lt;CELL PHONE RINGING&gt;

25:40.870 --> 25:42.290
AH!

25:42.330 --> 25:45.040
MY PUBLISHER,
SHE'S DRIVING ME NUTS!

25:45.080 --> 25:47.290
SHE WANTS PAGES, PAGES, PAGES.

25:47.330 --> 25:49.960
I'M AN ARTIST. PAGES COME
WHEN MY ASSISTANT WRITES THEM!

25:50.000 --> 25:51.670
&lt;CHUCKLES&gt;

25:51.710 --> 25:54.050
SO, THIS THE WAY YOU
WRITE ALL YOUR BOOKS?

25:54.090 --> 25:55.470
HANDS ON LIKE THIS?

25:55.510 --> 25:56.640
MMM, NOT QUITE,

25:56.680 --> 25:58.930
BUT THIS GETS
A CERTAIN ENERGY,

25:58.970 --> 26:00.890
TRANSLATES TO THE PAGE,
I FEEL.

26:00.930 --> 26:02.310
DANGEROUS THOUGH, I'D SAY.

26:02.350 --> 26:03.930
WHAT'S LIFE
WITHOUT A LITTLE SPARK?

26:07.230 --> 26:09.310
YOU EVER THINK OF TRYING
SOMETHING DIFFERENT?

26:09.360 --> 26:11.320
YOU DON'T WANT
TO LOOK BACK LATER IN LIFE
AND WISH YOU HAD.

26:11.360 --> 26:13.740
YEAH, WELL,
TELL THAT TO THE BANK.

26:13.780 --> 26:14.740
HARD TO TRY SOMETHING NEW

26:14.780 --> 26:16.780
WHEN YOU'VE GOT A MORTGAGE
AND YOUR OWN BUSINESS.

26:16.820 --> 26:19.530
HMM, I CAN SYMPATHIZE.

26:19.570 --> 26:22.660
SOMETIMES YOU JUST HAVE
TO TAKE A LEAP OF FAITH.

26:22.700 --> 26:23.700
SPEAKING OF WHICH,

26:24.500 --> 26:25.750
DO YOU HAVE A BUG?

26:33.800 --> 26:35.670
SORRY, SORRY TO INTERRUPT,
CAN I TALK TO YOU FOR A SEC?

26:35.720 --> 26:36.630
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

26:37.880 --> 26:39.010
HI.

26:39.050 --> 26:41.050
JAKE, BE QUICK,
I'M WORKING HERE.

26:41.100 --> 26:44.060
DO YOU KNOW A GUY,
HIS NAME IS, UH,
STAFF SERGEANT BANFIELD?

26:44.100 --> 26:45.140
YEAH.

26:47.230 --> 26:48.690
I'M PRETTY SURE
HE'S A DIRTY COP.

26:48.730 --> 26:51.360
THAT'S A BIG ACCUSATION
TO BE MAKING.

26:51.400 --> 26:52.900
I KNOW, BUT HE HAS
A BRIEFCASE FULL OF CASH

26:52.940 --> 26:54.190
IN THE TRUNK OF HIS CAR.

26:54.230 --> 26:55.320
AND YOU KNOW THAT FOR A FACT

26:55.360 --> 26:57.490
IT'S NOT JUST EVIDENCE
FOR A CASE?

26:57.530 --> 26:58.700
I DON'T KNOW, YOU TELL ME.

27:01.910 --> 27:05.750
THIS IS SOMETHING,
BUT BANFIELD'S GOT
A STERLING REPUTATION, OKAY?

27:05.790 --> 27:07.120
IT'S GONNA BE TOUGH.

27:07.160 --> 27:08.370
AN INNOCENT MAN

27:08.420 --> 27:10.500
MIGHT GO TO JAIL
FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE.

27:10.540 --> 27:11.540
CAN'T YOU DO ANYTHING?

27:13.090 --> 27:14.710
IT'S A CLOSED CASE.

27:14.750 --> 27:16.800
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GET
THE CROWN TO SIGN OFF ON IT.

27:17.470 --> 27:18.630
TALK TO ALLISON.

27:18.680 --> 27:19.840
&lt;SIGHS&gt;

27:22.140 --> 27:23.810
SO, HOW YOU DOING? YOU OKAY?

27:24.350 --> 27:26.270
YEAH, I'M FINE. GREAT.

27:27.930 --> 27:28.850
I DON'T KNOW.

27:29.940 --> 27:32.310
I MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING THAT...

27:32.810 --> 27:34.150
WHAT?

27:34.190 --> 27:36.030
[POLICE ON RADIO]
SARGEANT BENNETT,
COME IN PLEASE.

27:36.070 --> 27:38.150
NOTHING. IT'S NOTHING.

27:38.190 --> 27:39.450
THIS IS SERGEANT BENNETT.

27:41.030 --> 27:42.870
GOODBYE, I'M WORKING HERE.

27:54.790 --> 27:57.460
SO, YOU THINK
BANFIELD'S A DIRTY COP?

27:57.510 --> 27:58.800
HARD TO SAY.
I CHECKED WITH LESLIE,

27:58.840 --> 28:00.260
BUT SHE'S GONNA
NEED MORE INFO.

28:01.470 --> 28:02.680
HOW'D IT GO WITH LESLIE?

28:02.720 --> 28:03.760
FINE. WHY?

28:03.800 --> 28:05.930
ANYTHING ELSE GOING ON THERE?

28:05.970 --> 28:07.060
LIKE WHAT?

28:08.100 --> 28:09.350
&lt;SIGHS&gt; JAKE,

28:10.350 --> 28:11.350
I HATE TO SAY THIS,

28:13.150 --> 28:15.570
BUT I WANT YOU TO BE HAPPY,
YOU DESERVE IT.

28:15.610 --> 28:18.230
YOU'VE GOT THE CHEMISTRY,
YOU AND LESLIE.

28:18.280 --> 28:20.110
YOU'VE BEEN SPENDING
TOO MUCH TIME WITH STEELE.

28:20.150 --> 28:21.280
HE'S STARTING
TO RUB OFF ON YOU.

28:21.320 --> 28:22.490
WHAT?

28:22.530 --> 28:23.700
IT DOESN'T TAKE
A MYSTERY WRITER

28:23.740 --> 28:25.070
TO SEE YOU'VE STILL
GOT FEELINGS FOR THE GIRL.

28:25.120 --> 28:26.910
REAL FEELINGS.

28:26.950 --> 28:30.960
OH, MY GOD, I WISH EVERYONE
WOULD JUST MIND THEIR
OWN BUSINESS, YOU KNOW?

28:31.000 --> 28:33.460
LAST TIME I'LL SAY
SOMETHING NICE TO YOU.

28:33.500 --> 28:35.710
SPEAKING OF MICKEY SPILLANE,
WHERE THE HELL IS HE?

28:35.750 --> 28:37.880
DID YOU DITCH HIM? OH, PLEASE,
TELL ME THAT YOU DITCHED HIM.

28:39.300 --> 28:40.420
HE'S INSIDE.

28:42.590 --> 28:43.890
HE'S GOT A PLAN.

28:43.930 --> 28:45.850
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?

28:45.890 --> 28:47.970
HE'S GONNA BLOW THE WHOLE
FRIGGING OPERATION.

28:49.850 --> 28:51.980
I KNOW YOU DID IT.
EXCUSE ME?

28:52.020 --> 28:53.600
I KNOW YOU DID IT.
MURRAY'S MURDER!

28:53.650 --> 28:55.270
WE BOTH KNOW YOU'RE BEHIND IT!

28:55.310 --> 28:57.570
STEELE, JUST TAKE IT EASY,
ALL RIGHT?

28:57.610 --> 28:58.900
OKAY, HEY,

28:58.940 --> 29:00.690
HE'S A WRITER,
HE'S NOT A FIGHTER, SO...

29:01.530 --> 29:03.450
STEELE! WHAT IS
WRONG WITH YOU?

29:03.490 --> 29:04.950
OKAY, LOOK,
I'M REALLY SORRY ABOUT--

29:04.990 --> 29:07.120
AH!

29:07.160 --> 29:08.450
I'M NOT IN THE MOOD FOR THIS!

29:09.870 --> 29:10.830
YOU'RE MISTAKEN.

29:10.870 --> 29:12.870
THAT MIGHT BE A GOOD
LITTLE STORY FOR YOUR BOOK,

29:12.910 --> 29:14.830
BUT I LOVED MURRAY,
LIKE A BROTHER.

29:14.870 --> 29:16.710
JUST-- OH! NOT IN THE FACE!

29:16.750 --> 29:18.880
&lt;COUCHING&gt; NOT THE GUT EITHER.

29:18.920 --> 29:20.340
THAT'S WHAT CAIN SAID
ABOUT ABEL.

29:20.380 --> 29:21.590
OH!

29:21.630 --> 29:23.010
IF YOU GUYS DON'T LEAVE,
I'M GOING TO CALL THE POLICE.

29:23.050 --> 29:25.590
GOOD! WE CAN EXPLAIN
HOW YOU PAID VINCE $50,000!

29:25.640 --> 29:26.890
AH!

29:28.640 --> 29:30.520
ALL RIGHT. OKAY.

29:31.810 --> 29:32.980
YOU DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

29:33.020 --> 29:34.100
I GET THAT.

29:38.020 --> 29:39.480
AND WE BOTH KNOW,
IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME

29:39.520 --> 29:40.650
BEFORE I PROVE EVERYTHING.

29:42.860 --> 29:44.150
SORRY.

29:44.200 --> 29:45.410
STEELE.

29:47.700 --> 29:48.740
WHAT WERE YOU DOING?

29:48.780 --> 29:50.080
I HAD A PLAN.

30:02.670 --> 30:04.880
YOU MIND TELLING ME
WHAT THE HELL
WE'RE DOING OUT HERE, STEELE?

30:04.920 --> 30:05.840
IT'S A PLAN, DEAR JAKE.

30:05.880 --> 30:07.260
OH, A PLAN?

30:07.300 --> 30:09.300
LIKE YOUR PLAN TO PICK
A FIGHT WITH A TRAINED FIGHTER

30:09.350 --> 30:10.760
AND WATCH ME GET
THE CRAP KICKED OUT OF ME?

30:10.810 --> 30:12.100
LOOK, OBVIOUSLY
I AM MUCH TOO REFINED

30:12.140 --> 30:13.350
TO SUCCUMB TO PETTY VIOLENCE.

30:13.390 --> 30:14.560
OH, RIGHT,

30:14.600 --> 30:16.520
SO, WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE?

30:16.560 --> 30:17.900
SEE?

30:17.940 --> 30:20.060
I WAS BUGGING
OUR LITTLE FRIEND CLINT.

30:20.110 --> 30:21.360
IMPRESSED, JARED BOYLE?

30:21.400 --> 30:22.780
NOT A BAD PLAN, YOU ASK ME.

30:22.820 --> 30:23.900
FINALLY, A MAN WITH TASTE.

30:31.160 --> 30:33.370
[STEELE] AND THERE IS
OUR FRIEND, CLINT.

30:35.960 --> 30:37.080
[JAKE] THERE'S BANFIELD,

30:37.120 --> 30:39.000
HOW DO YOU TURN THIS UP?

30:39.040 --> 30:40.920
&lt;ON SPEAKER&gt; BEFORE WE MAKE THIS HAPPEN,

30:40.960 --> 30:43.050
I NEED TO KNOW
YOU'RE THE KIND OF GUY
WHO CAN GET THINGS DONE.

30:43.090 --> 30:44.550
CAN YOU GO ALL THE WAY
IF I NEED YOU TO?

30:44.920 --> 30:46.380
ASK VINCE BRAGG,

30:46.420 --> 30:48.590
OR, UH, MURRAY PECKFORD.

30:48.640 --> 30:50.350
[BANFIELD] DO YOU WANT TO
TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED THERE?

30:50.390 --> 30:52.970
[CLINT] YOU WANNA SAMPLE
OR YOU WANNA TALK?

30:55.060 --> 30:56.140
THIS CHECKS OUT,

30:56.180 --> 30:58.060
I'LL MEET YOU LATER
IN MY GYM, OKAY?

31:00.480 --> 31:01.730
WHAT THE HELL?

31:01.770 --> 31:04.860
BANFIELD DIDN'T PAY VINCE
TO KILL MURRAY.

31:04.900 --> 31:05.900
CLINT DID.

31:12.240 --> 31:13.950
WE KNOW CLINT
PAID YOU TO KILL MURRAY.

31:13.990 --> 31:16.120
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

31:16.160 --> 31:17.120
I BROKE IN,

31:17.160 --> 31:18.250
MURRAY SURPRISED ME--

31:18.290 --> 31:19.420
THEN WHERE DID
YOU GET THE $50,000?

31:21.380 --> 31:22.750
[VINCE] IT'S PRIZE MONEY.

31:22.790 --> 31:25.090
REALLY? FROM WHAT,
A BEAUTY PAGEANT?

31:26.590 --> 31:28.220
YOU HAVEN'T WON
A FIGHT IN MONTHS, VINCE.

31:28.260 --> 31:30.760
WHY YOU DOING THIS?
YOU HAVE A WIFE.

31:30.800 --> 31:31.890
YOU HAVE A LITTLE KID.

31:31.930 --> 31:33.350
WE'RE GIVING YOU A CHOICE.

31:33.390 --> 31:34.850
COME CLEAN AND TURN IN CLINT,

31:34.890 --> 31:37.020
OR WE GO TO THE R.N.C.
WITH OUR EVIDENCE,

31:37.060 --> 31:38.690
AND YOU NEVER
SEE YOUR KID AGAIN.

31:39.690 --> 31:41.020
PLEASE, LEAVE.

31:43.270 --> 31:44.270
&lt;SIGHS&gt;

31:53.030 --> 31:54.030
KELSEY?

31:55.540 --> 31:57.040
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

31:57.080 --> 31:59.080
I'M SORRY BABY, I AM.

32:01.500 --> 32:02.960
THEY WANT TO HELP YOU.

32:05.210 --> 32:06.920
YOU SHOWED THEM THE MONEY,
DIDN'T YOU?

32:07.380 --> 32:08.840
WHY?

32:08.880 --> 32:10.430
I HAD IT COVERED, I...

32:10.470 --> 32:12.140
I TOLD YOU I WAS HANDLING IT.

32:12.180 --> 32:13.430
WE DON'T NEED THAT MONEY,

32:13.470 --> 32:14.510
WE NEED YOU.

32:15.140 --> 32:16.600
TELL THEM WHAT HAPPENED.

32:16.640 --> 32:18.390
PLEASE, THEY'LL HELP US.

32:21.060 --> 32:22.060
PLEASE.

32:25.310 --> 32:27.110
[VINCE] CLINT KNEW
ABOUT MY COLD STREAK,

32:27.150 --> 32:28.650
THAT I NEEDED THE MONEY.

32:30.280 --> 32:31.360
THE NIGHT OF MURRAY'S DEATH

32:31.400 --> 32:33.530
HE SHOWED UP
WITH AN ENVELOPE FULL OF CASH.

32:33.570 --> 32:34.870
YOU ACCEPTED IT.

32:34.910 --> 32:36.330
KILLED MURRAY AND CONFESSED
TO A B AND E

32:36.370 --> 32:37.740
TO GET A LIGHTER SENTENCE.

32:37.790 --> 32:40.040
NO, NO, NO.

32:40.080 --> 32:42.170
THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED.

32:45.170 --> 32:46.040
&lt;VOICE CRACKING&gt; NO.

32:47.590 --> 32:49.460
WHY DON'T YOU TELL US
THE REAL STORY, VINCE?

32:50.210 --> 32:51.220
[VINCE] CLINT PAID ME

32:52.220 --> 32:54.090
TO CONFESS TO MURRAY'S MURDER.

32:55.640 --> 32:58.640
I NEVER KILLED ANYBODY.
I'M INNOCENT.

33:04.230 --> 33:06.020
VINCE BRAGG IS INNOCENT.

33:06.060 --> 33:09.030
WELL, HIS LAWYER TOOK
THE FIRST PLEA AGREEMENT
THAT I OFFERED.

33:09.070 --> 33:11.780
VINCE IS GONNA SERVE
10 YEARS FOR MANSLAUGHTER.

33:11.820 --> 33:13.320
SOMEONE PAID HIM
TO TAKE THE FALL, ALL RIGHT?

33:13.360 --> 33:14.860
HE DIDN'T DO IT.

33:14.910 --> 33:16.200
DO YOU HAVE ANY EVIDENCE?

33:16.240 --> 33:18.580
VINCE'S TESTIMONY,

33:18.620 --> 33:20.700
AND, UH, THERE'S A DEAL
OF SOME KIND

33:20.750 --> 33:23.040
GOING DOWN TONIGHT,
MONEY FOR SOMETHING.

33:23.080 --> 33:24.460
FOR WHAT?

33:24.500 --> 33:25.670
I DON'T KNOW,
BUT IT'S CONNECTED.

33:26.380 --> 33:27.920
SO, WHO'S YOUR FRIEND, BABE?

33:29.170 --> 33:30.800
JAKE DOYLE, BABE.

33:30.840 --> 33:34.340
OH, SO YOU'RE THE GUY
WHO'S TRYING TO
BREAK UP MY MARRIAGE.

33:34.380 --> 33:36.800
LOOK, BUDDY, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOUR PROBLEM IS, BUT...

33:36.840 --> 33:38.930
HEY, SIMON, WHY DON'T
I MEET YOU BACK AT THE HOTEL?

33:38.970 --> 33:40.140
[SIMON] I THINK
YOU'RE DONE HERE,

33:40.180 --> 33:42.480
SO, MUCK ALONG.

33:43.180 --> 33:44.520
FIND YOUR OWN LADY.

33:50.860 --> 33:52.070
I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.

33:52.110 --> 33:53.900
NO, NO. DON'T BE.

33:53.950 --> 33:55.240
HE'S A CHARMING GUY.

33:55.280 --> 33:57.160
LITTLE WEIRD THAT YOU BROUGHT
HIM HERE, THOUGH.

33:57.200 --> 33:59.240
I DIDN'T WANT TO, BELIEVE ME.

33:59.280 --> 34:01.120
MY HANDS ARE TIED
WITH VINCE, OKAY?

34:01.160 --> 34:03.250
BRING ME SOMETHING
THAT I CAN USE.

34:14.090 --> 34:15.090
[JAKE] ANYTHING?

34:18.890 --> 34:20.470
NO, NOTHING.

34:20.510 --> 34:22.810
HASN'T LEFT THE GYM SINCE
HE GOT THERE THIS MORNING.

34:22.850 --> 34:24.560
THOUGH HE COWARDLY CANCELED
ALL TRAINING SESSIONS.

34:24.600 --> 34:26.100
ANYONE EVER
THINK ABOUT THE FACT

34:26.140 --> 34:28.440
THAT MAYBE HE LEFT THROUGH
THE BACK DOOR OR SOMETHING?

34:28.480 --> 34:31.190
WELL, THE G.P.S.
IN THE BUG THAT MR. STEELE
PLANTED THIS MORNING

34:31.230 --> 34:32.530
IS STILL FUNCTIONING,

34:32.570 --> 34:33.990
AND HE HASN'T MOVED ANYWHERE.

34:34.030 --> 34:36.240
OOH, SOUND'S STILL
BROKEN, THOUGH.

34:37.320 --> 34:38.820
GOTTA STRETCH MY LEGS.

34:43.080 --> 34:44.080
&lt;SIGHS&gt;

34:45.290 --> 34:46.210
WELL, HERE'S AN IDEA,

34:46.250 --> 34:48.710
MAYBE THEY MOVED THE MEET
TO ANOTHER LOCATION.

34:48.750 --> 34:49.830
EVER THINK OF THAT?

34:49.880 --> 34:50.920
NOPE.

34:51.920 --> 34:53.420
[JAKE] DAD,
IT'S BANFIELD'S CRUISER.

34:53.460 --> 34:55.550
THE MEET, IT'S HAPPENING NOW.
LET'S GO.

34:55.590 --> 34:56.670
WHERE'S STEELE?

34:56.720 --> 34:57.800
[JAKE] SON OF A--
&lt;CELL PHONE RINGING&gt;

35:00.930 --> 35:02.310
[JAKE] LESLIE.

35:02.350 --> 35:05.140
[LESLIE] HEY LOOK,
I KNOW YOU WERE LOOKING
INTO STAFF SERGEANT BANFIELD.

35:05.180 --> 35:06.230
DON'T, OKAY?

35:06.270 --> 35:07.480
I NEED YOU TO BACK OFF.

35:07.520 --> 35:08.980
IT'S TROUBLE,

35:09.020 --> 35:10.100
BIG TROUBLE.

35:10.560 --> 35:11.730
WHY?

35:13.360 --> 35:14.440
I TOLD YOU MAN, I'M CLEAN.

35:16.320 --> 35:17.450
SO, YOU GOT THE STUFF?

35:17.490 --> 35:18.570
OF COURSE.

35:20.490 --> 35:21.950
WHERE'S YOURS?

35:21.990 --> 35:23.240
IT'S RIGHT HERE.

35:24.410 --> 35:25.330
BOXING BAGS.

35:25.370 --> 35:27.620
EVERYTHING YOU ASKED FOR
IS RIGHT IN HERE.

35:30.250 --> 35:31.540
SMART.

35:31.580 --> 35:33.590
YOU USE THEM
TO SMUGGLE THE MERCH
INTO THE COUNTRY.

35:33.630 --> 35:35.920
[CLINT] SO, I ASSUME
THIS IS SATISFACTORY.

35:35.960 --> 35:37.090
[BANFIELD] OH, YEAH!

35:38.220 --> 35:39.760
BUT THIS DOESN'T
HAVE TO END HERE.

35:39.800 --> 35:42.090
WE HAVE JOBS AND WE CAN
ALWAYS USE PEOPLE LIKE YOU.

35:42.140 --> 35:43.180
WELL, I'M INTERESTED.

35:43.220 --> 35:45.680
I JUST NEED TO KNOW,
BEFORE YOU MEET MY FRIENDS,

35:45.720 --> 35:46.890
WHAT YOU CAN PULL OFF.

35:48.180 --> 35:50.560
THAT MURRAY PECKFORD MURDER,
THAT WAS YOU?

35:50.600 --> 35:52.190
YOU ASKING AS A COP?

35:52.230 --> 35:55.070
&lt;SCOFFS&gt; YEAH, A COP
WHO DEALS DRUGS, RIGHT.

35:55.110 --> 35:58.820
I JUST NEED TO KNOW
IF YOU'VE GOT THE BALLS
FOR SOME BIGGER STUFF.

35:58.860 --> 36:00.400
MY POSITION IN THE R.N.C.,

36:00.450 --> 36:02.200
I CAN GET US
MUCH MORE THAN THIS.

36:02.240 --> 36:03.740
WELL, LET'S JUST WORRY
ABOUT THIS,

36:03.780 --> 36:05.870
WE'LL TALK SOME OTHER
TIME ABOUT MY BALLS.

36:05.910 --> 36:07.080
&lt;CELL PHONE RINGING&gt;

36:17.380 --> 36:20.010
LOOKS LIKE YOUR NEXT BOOK'S
COMING OUT POSTHUMOUSLY.

36:21.010 --> 36:22.840
I AM SO STEALING THAT LINE.

36:28.220 --> 36:29.390
LOOK WHO'S EAVESDROPPING.

36:29.430 --> 36:32.020
I WAS JUST DOING RESEARCH
FOR MY BOOK.

36:32.060 --> 36:34.770
WELL, I'M ABOUT TO CREATE
ANOTHER MYSTERY FOR YOU.

36:34.810 --> 36:37.360
THE DISAPPEARANCE
OF GARRISON STEELE.

36:37.400 --> 36:39.110
THAT'S CORNY, EVEN FOR ME.

36:39.820 --> 36:41.780
WHOA! HOLD ON,

36:41.820 --> 36:43.490
THIS ISN'T THE PLACE
TO KILL SOMEONE,

36:43.530 --> 36:45.280
ESPECIALLY A FRINGE CELEBRITY.

36:45.320 --> 36:46.990
"FRINGE"?
&lt;DOOR OPENS&gt;

36:48.120 --> 36:49.290
DON'T KILL HIM.

36:49.330 --> 36:50.710
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
SAVING YOUR ASS.

36:50.750 --> 36:51.960
HE HAS MORE THAN ONE BULLET!

36:52.000 --> 36:54.330
I'VE GOT ENOUGH BULLETS
FOR BOTH OF YOU, BELIEVE ME.

36:54.380 --> 36:55.880
JUST BACK OFF!

36:55.920 --> 36:57.380
SO, WHAT'S THE PLAN, CLINT?

36:57.420 --> 36:59.260
HUH? YOU GONNA KILL US,

36:59.300 --> 37:00.590
LIKE YOU KILLED MURRAY?

37:00.630 --> 37:01.970
WHAT IS THIS?

37:02.010 --> 37:03.340
YOU'RE PATHETIC,
YOU KNOW THAT?

37:03.380 --> 37:05.800
YOU USED MURRAY'S GYM
AS A FRONT TO SELL YOUR DRUGS,

37:05.850 --> 37:07.560
MURRAY FINDS OUT
SO YOU OFF HIM?

37:07.600 --> 37:08.970
WHAT DOES THIS
GOT TO DO WITH YOU?

37:09.020 --> 37:11.390
AN INNOCENT MAN
IS GONNA GO TO JAIL.

37:11.430 --> 37:12.310
YOU KILLED MURRAY, YOU DID IT?

37:12.350 --> 37:13.520
[CLINT] WELL,
VINCE NEEDED THE MONEY.

37:13.560 --> 37:15.730
I PAID HIM TO TAKE THE FALL.

37:15.770 --> 37:17.360
THE WORLD'S FULL OF SUCKERS.

37:17.400 --> 37:18.860
YOU'RE A REAL SCUMBAG,
YOU KNOW THAT?

37:18.900 --> 37:21.360
YEAH. NOW, DON'T MOVE,

37:21.400 --> 37:22.740
'CAUSE I GOTTA KILL
YOU TOO NOW.

37:22.780 --> 37:24.820
HOW MANY MORE PEOPLE
HAVE TO DIE, CLINT?

37:24.860 --> 37:26.030
WHAT ABOUT YOU, HUH?

37:26.070 --> 37:27.450
YOU WERE A COP!

37:27.490 --> 37:29.200
A GOOD COP,
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

37:29.240 --> 37:30.620
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, DOYLE?

37:30.660 --> 37:32.080
YEAH, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
SHUT UP.

37:32.120 --> 37:33.620
ENOUGH!
HEY, CLINT!

37:33.660 --> 37:34.960
STEELE!

37:36.460 --> 37:37.880
&lt;GUN FIRING&gt;

37:47.300 --> 37:48.430
AH!

37:48.470 --> 37:50.600
WELL, THAT WAS DRAMATIC.

37:50.640 --> 37:52.060
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TWO
TRYING TO DO HERE?

37:52.100 --> 37:53.600
IDIOTS, I'M ON A CASE!

37:55.520 --> 37:57.190
YOU GOT YOUR CONFESSION,
DIDN'T YOU?

37:57.230 --> 37:58.480
ARGH!

37:58.520 --> 37:59.690
[STEELE] WELL, WELL, WELL.

37:59.730 --> 38:01.690
DIRTY COP
ISN'T SO DIRTY AFTER ALL,

38:01.730 --> 38:03.400
NICE PLOT TWIST.

38:04.530 --> 38:05.910
THANKS FOR THE SAVE.

38:08.450 --> 38:09.450
GOOD WORK, JARED.

38:10.200 --> 38:11.370
&lt;CHUCKLES&gt;

38:16.250 --> 38:18.670
WHOA, STEROIDS!

38:18.710 --> 38:21.340
CLASSIC MISTER BIG
SCENARIO, HUH?

38:21.380 --> 38:23.260
SO, THIS WHOLE DRUGS THING
WAS A RUSE

38:23.300 --> 38:25.510
TO GET CLINT
TO CONFESS TO MURDER?

38:25.550 --> 38:27.090
AND THIS IS THE ONLY WAY
WE COULD GET A CONVICTION,

38:27.130 --> 38:29.260
BECAUSE VINCE HAD CONFESSED.

38:29.300 --> 38:31.140
COULDN'T GET HIM TO TALK
UNTIL YOUR FRIEND SHOWED UP.

38:31.180 --> 38:32.680
I SEEM TO HAVE
THAT EFFECT ON PEOPLE.

38:32.720 --> 38:34.390
HOPEFULLY, WITH OUR TESTIMONY
WE CAN PUT CLINT AWAY

38:34.430 --> 38:35.600
AND GET VINCE OUT.

38:35.640 --> 38:37.520
TESTIMONY, WHAT ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?

38:37.560 --> 38:39.150
WEREN'T YOU WEARING
A WIRE OR SOMETHING,

38:39.190 --> 38:40.650
DID YOU GET
ANY OF THIS ON TAPE?

38:40.690 --> 38:42.320
CLINT CHECKS FOR WIRES.

38:43.730 --> 38:45.320
OH, WELL, UM,

38:46.530 --> 38:48.070
MAYBE YOU COULD USE THIS.

38:49.370 --> 38:50.950
SHOULD HAVE EVERYTHING ON IT.

38:53.410 --> 38:55.370
I'M SO IMPRESSED, JAKE DOYLE.

38:56.620 --> 38:59.170
YEAH, WELL, YOU OWE ME ONE.

39:03.590 --> 39:04.630
BEST OF LUCK.

39:10.090 --> 39:11.510
YOU OKAY?

39:11.550 --> 39:12.930
YOU DIDN'T GET SHOT?

39:12.970 --> 39:14.930
NO.

39:14.970 --> 39:18.270
THANKS FOR THE TIP
ABOUT BANFIELD.

39:18.310 --> 39:19.690
YOU'RE... YOU'RE WELCOME.

39:23.480 --> 39:24.690
SO, I GUESS
I'LL SEE YOU AROUND.

39:25.530 --> 39:26.570
YEAH.

39:55.640 --> 39:59.230
UH, NICE... NICE WORK, DOYLE.

39:59.270 --> 40:01.350
[JAKE] YEAH, OOH,

40:01.400 --> 40:03.690
IT... IT WAS, A PLEASURE
AS ALWAYS, YOU KNOW?

40:21.620 --> 40:22.920
A PARTING GIFT.

40:23.790 --> 40:25.340
THANK YOU.

40:25.380 --> 40:27.210
IT'S NOT FOR YOU,
IT'S FOR ROSE AND MALACHY.

40:27.250 --> 40:28.800
RIGHT, OF COURSE, WELL...

40:30.010 --> 40:32.130
SO, THIS IS GOODBYE,
YOU'RE LEAVING, THEN?

40:32.180 --> 40:34.260
YES, AND WITH ME
GOES MY NEWEST WORK.

40:34.300 --> 40:37.010
YOU KNOW,
IT MAY BE MY BEST YET.

40:37.060 --> 40:40.520
I THINK I'VE DUG DEEPER INTO
THE HEART OF JARED THIS TIME.

40:40.560 --> 40:42.560
HMM, WHATEVER.

40:42.600 --> 40:45.610
BUT WHAT DOES OUR HERO
DO IN THE END?

40:45.650 --> 40:49.570
DOES HE RID HIMSELF
OF HIS LONGING
AND FOLLOW HIS HEART?

40:49.610 --> 40:50.990
MAN, I... I'VE GOTTA
BE HONEST WITH YOU,

40:51.030 --> 40:52.700
I AM REALLY LOOKING FORWARD
TO YOU LEAVING.

40:52.740 --> 40:54.200
JAKE,

40:54.240 --> 40:57.240
YOU AND THE MARRIED ALLISON,

40:58.740 --> 41:00.660
IF THESE THINGS END,

41:00.700 --> 41:02.920
IT'S A SIGN
THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO.

41:03.920 --> 41:04.960
AND IF YOU DON'T
MIND ME SAYING,

41:06.210 --> 41:07.800
LIFE IS SHORT,

41:07.840 --> 41:10.630
DON'T WASTE IT IN THE MARGINS
WITH INADEQUATE LOVERS.

41:11.220 --> 41:12.300
BEST OF LUCK.

41:16.100 --> 41:17.140
STEELE.

41:20.430 --> 41:21.770
IT WAS FUN.

41:21.810 --> 41:23.190
SORT OF.

41:30.690 --> 41:34.410
[STEELE] ALL RIGHT,
YOU ARE GOING TO LOVE THIS.

41:34.450 --> 41:35.530
[MAL] WELL, GARRISON,

41:35.570 --> 41:37.320
IT WAS A REAL PLEASURE
WORKING WITH YOU.

41:37.370 --> 41:39.410
IT WAS.
SAME HERE, MALACHY DOYLE,

41:39.450 --> 41:41.540
AND IT WILL BE NICE
FOR MY SECOND BOOK

41:41.580 --> 41:43.830
TO HAVE THE PROPER DETAILS
OF JARED'S FATHER FIGURE,

41:43.870 --> 41:46.380
MAL BOYLE. HMM-HMM!

41:46.420 --> 41:50.380

HIS VIXEN AND SICKENINGLY
ATTRACTIVE WIFE.

41:51.170 --> 41:52.340

41:53.470 --> 41:54.510

42:10.900 --> 42:12.190

42:18.660 --> 42:19.620
&lt;KNOCKING ON DOOR&gt;

42:24.620 --> 42:25.620
JAKE.

42:25.660 --> 42:28.460
I JUST WANTED TO SAY GOODBYE,

42:28.500 --> 42:31.670
AND LET YOU KNOW
THAT I'M NOT GONNA MAKE
THIS COMPLICATED FOR YOU.

42:32.300 --> 42:33.420
[SIMON] WHO THE HELL IS IT?

42:34.130 --> 42:35.340
[ALLISON] IT'S NOTHING.

42:41.060 --> 42:42.430
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR ARM?

42:42.470 --> 42:44.890
IT'S NOTHING, JAKE.
LOOK, I CAN HANDLE IT.

42:45.810 --> 42:47.350
EXCUSE ME.

42:52.860 --> 42:54.690
WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?
A TOUGH GUY? HUH?

42:55.440 --> 42:56.610
OH!
JAKE!

42:58.910 --> 43:00.370
&lt;GROANS&gt;

43:03.540 --> 43:04.620
WHERE'S HIS STUFF?

43:04.660 --> 43:05.950
DOES HE HAVE A...

43:06.000 --> 43:07.080
IS THIS HIS SUITCASE?

43:07.120 --> 43:08.290
[ALLISON] YEAH.

43:10.880 --> 43:12.380
[JAKE] HEY, SIMON.

43:14.670 --> 43:16.380
TIME FOR YOU
TO CRASH SOMEWHERE ELSE.

43:20.800 --> 43:21.800
CIAO.
