00:28.770 --> 00:30.939
You know, I grew up in country like this. 

00:30.974 --> 00:33.073
My dad and I were riding horses ...

00:33.108 --> 00:36.368
... after these amazing high mountain lakes.

00:36.403 --> 00:40.116
We rode back to some pretty remote wilderness areas.

00:40.151 --> 00:44.746
With incredible streams, and meadows, and wildlife.

00:44.781 --> 00:46.831
I love it here. "B"

00:49.499 --> 00:50.966
look at this canyon.

00:51.001 --> 00:52.815
It reminds me of the Grand Canyon.

00:52.850 --> 00:54.594
It is this small stream,

00:54.629 --> 00:56.611
and these steep canyon walls.

00:56.646 --> 00:58.557
How long do you suppose it would take ...

00:58.592 --> 01:02.430
... for as stream as this small to remove this much material ...

01:02.465 --> 01:06.815
... and cut the canyon this deep ?

01:06.850 --> 01:11.189
This rock has a story, as you and I have.

01:11.224 --> 01:13.321
it came from somewhere.

01:13.356 --> 01:15.824
Many of these rocks have been dated to the

01:15.859 --> 01:20.031
350,000 years old, reaching 2 million.

01:20.066 --> 01:22.539
That is very old.

01:22.574 --> 01:24.624
But it might surprise you to know ...

01:24.659 --> 01:27.789
... that all geological formations we see here,

01:27.824 --> 01:32.168
cannons, layers, and even plants,

01:32.203 --> 01:34.634
They are younger than me.

01:34.669 --> 01:36.261
When I was born, none of this was here,

01:36.296 --> 01:39.050
but there was a large forest hundreds of feet deep ...

01:39.085 --> 01:42.351
... of where we stand now.

01:42.386 --> 01:45.390
In fact, before 1980, most people ...

01:45.430 --> 01:49.268
...  had never even heard of Mount St. Helena.

01:54.147 --> 01:56.365
It was on May 18 that year ...

01:56.400 --> 01:59.361
... molten rock that created a steam explosion ...

01:59.396 --> 02:02.287
... with the force of 20 million tons of dynamite.

02:02.322 --> 02:06.889
Avalanche debris and other flows of the eruption were deposited ...

02:06.924 --> 02:11.457
... and all those layers quickly reached 600 feet thick.

02:11.707 --> 02:15.669
A couple of years later there were more volcanic activity ...

02:15.704 --> 02:19.596
... which created a mudflow that separated this entire canyon.

02:19.631 --> 02:24.637
step also opened through the bedrock, all in a couple of days.

02:25.721 --> 02:29.516
Is not it amazing what a little information about the past ...

02:29.551 --> 02:33.312
... you can do to help change the way you watch this ...

02:33.347 --> 02:37.292
... and present world around you?

02:37.327 --> 02:41.237
Many people assume a lot about ...

02:41.403 --> 02:44.364
... in the history of the Earth around us.

02:44.399 --> 02:47.326
The question is, how these assumptions affect ...

02:47.361 --> 02:50.293
... the way we see the story?

02:50.328 --> 02:54.548
But more importantly, what role they play in ...

02:54.583 --> 02:57.843
... the way we view science and the Bible?

02:57.878 --> 03:02.884
Did God create the world in a few days or thousands of millions of years?

03:05.052 --> 03:07.686
Is humanity descended from primates ...

03:07.721 --> 03:11.850
... or God created us instantly, his image?

03:11.885 --> 03:15.980
Was there a global flood that destroyed the Earth ...

03:16.015 --> 03:18.530
... or is that a myth?

03:18.565 --> 03:23.112
In other words, is Genesis story?

04:00.148 --> 04:02.109
When we think about the history of Earth,

04:02.144 --> 04:04.034
There are many things to consider.

04:04.069 --> 04:07.824
But one of the most fascinating is the story of the Flood.

04:07.859 --> 04:10.749
¿It came over the whole Earth covered in water?

04:10.784 --> 04:12.911
Genesis says that the waters prevailed ...

04:12.946 --> 04:15.181
... on Earth to such an extent that the mountains ...

04:15.216 --> 04:17.233
... under the whole heaven they were covered.

04:17.269 --> 04:19.252
So if the Flood was truly global,

04:19.286 --> 04:22.386
Was not there much evidence?

04:22.421 --> 04:24.882
I had heard from a scientist that happened ...

04:24.917 --> 04:27.307
... more than 40 years studying this question.

04:27.342 --> 04:29.470
When I spoke with him, he said there was an excellent place ...

04:29.505 --> 04:32.181
... where we could see evidence of global Flood.

04:35.308 --> 04:37.937
Steve, I have to admit, I've been here several times ...

04:37.972 --> 04:40.773
... but every time I come it's amazing.

04:40.808 --> 04:42.114
In addition to my home,

04:42.149 --> 04:45.277
the Grand Canyon is my favorite place on Earth.

04:45.312 --> 04:48.406
So, Steve, tell me, what do you see here?

04:48.441 --> 04:50.330
When we see the Grand Canyon, we ...

04:50.365 --> 04:54.251
... the inside story of the earth beneath our feet.

04:54.286 --> 04:58.144
And we have a kind of layered cake, right? Strata ...

04:58.179 --> 05:02.003
... that they have been eroded to our advantage to see ...

05:02.038 --> 05:05.127
... the inner structure of the Earth.

05:05.162 --> 05:08.181
These same layers are in Colorado,

05:08.216 --> 05:10.802
Also in Illinois, and Pennsylvania.

05:10.837 --> 05:13.389
So when you say sedimentary strata,

05:13.424 --> 05:15.355
Are you talking about the layers we see?

05:15.390 --> 05:18.442
Yes. The lower layers are formed first.

05:18.477 --> 05:22.982
These are grains of sediment were mixed, separated,

05:23.017 --> 05:25.818
and flowed here from different directions ...

05:25.853 --> 05:29.036
... and they piled one on another.

05:29.071 --> 05:33.368
And then, of course, become naturally in rock.

05:33.403 --> 05:34.720
So you're saying that the solid Earth ...

05:34.755 --> 05:36.814
... on which we stand right now ...

05:36.849 --> 05:38.873
... if we went in its history, would it be liquid?

05:38.908 --> 05:39.838
Yes.

05:39.873 --> 05:42.841
The ocean is doing amazing things ...

05:42.876 --> 05:46.714
... and water with incredible power is deposited ...

05:46.749 --> 05:48.838
... the layers we see in the canyon.

05:48.873 --> 05:50.891
And there are fossils in all those layers?

05:50.926 --> 05:53.393
There are marine fossils at all layers.

05:53.428 --> 05:58.023
But the standard explanation is that there were 17 advances and retreats ...

05:58.058 --> 06:02.605
... different ocean on American continental crust,

06:02.640 --> 06:06.067
and that spread over hundreds of millions of years.

06:06.102 --> 06:07.908
And what is the evidence you see here ...

06:07.943 --> 06:10.863
... you'd say that does not seem to make sense?

06:10.898 --> 06:12.913
4,000 feet flat layers ...

06:12.948 --> 06:16.285
... in the canyon they are flat and one relative to another,

06:16.320 --> 06:18.168
we see between the layers of strata ...

06:18.203 --> 06:22.250
... and we see the passage of time between the layers.

06:22.285 --> 06:23.256
You mean to erosion?

06:23.291 --> 06:25.753
Erosion, especially and channeling ...

06:25.788 --> 06:29.096
... not visible on a large scale.

06:29.131 --> 06:31.181
And then we see strata as such ...

06:31.216 --> 06:35.429
... and they provide evidence of rapid sedimentation, very fast.

06:35.464 --> 06:39.642
Just minutes or hours is what it takes to make the layers.

06:39.677 --> 06:41.853
Well, tell me about the history of these layers.

06:41.888 --> 06:43.193
How did they get here?

06:43.228 --> 06:45.940
"The six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month ...

06:45.975 --> 06:47.406
... on the seventeenth day of the month,

06:47.441 --> 06:49.777
the same day were all the fountains of the great deep,

06:49.812 --> 06:53.245
and the windows of heaven were opened ... "

06:53.280 --> 06:56.409
My understanding is that the rupture occurred ocean floor,

06:56.444 --> 06:59.325
some kind of magma or earthquake prompted ...

06:59.360 --> 07:02.206
... the oceans on continental crust.

07:02.241 --> 07:04.089
So that's the reason why ...

07:04.124 --> 07:06.544
... we have these marine fossils in these layers?

07:06.579 --> 07:08.427
Yes. And we have six months ...

07:08.462 --> 07:10.303
... where the waters prevailed upon the earth.

07:10.338 --> 07:13.676
Approximately seven months for the water to subside.

07:13.711 --> 07:16.554
4,000 feet of strata probably represent ...

07:16.589 --> 07:19.557
... early and middle stage of global Flood ...

07:19.592 --> 07:21.189
... right there in the Grand Canyon.

07:21.224 --> 07:25.063
We have other local strata in this region of the Grand Canyon.

07:25.098 --> 07:27.029
It is called the Grand Staircase.

07:27.064 --> 07:30.902
We have about 10,000 feet, strata two miles thick ...

07:30.937 --> 07:32.421
... above the Grand Canyon.

07:32.456 --> 07:33.764
Higher than where we are.

07:33.799 --> 07:35.037
Higher than where we are,

07:35.072 --> 07:39.202
and that represents the later stages of the Flood ...

07:39.237 --> 07:40.834
... and the return of the flood water.

07:40.869 --> 07:43.837
This surface was chamfered by the withdrawal of flood waters ...

07:43.872 --> 07:47.627
... and while the flood retreated to the newly formed ocean basins ...

07:47.662 --> 07:50.719
... then probably they emerged continental crust ...

07:50.754 --> 07:55.760
... and the Ark, of course, he was perched on the high ground in the Middle East.

07:56.802 --> 07:59.054
Well, there are some people who say ...

07:59.089 --> 08:01.271
... that record is a local flood.

08:01.306 --> 08:04.602
I think it's a global flood and high mountains all ...

08:04.637 --> 08:07.271
... or the whole sky was covered, a universal declaration,

08:07.306 --> 08:10.280
but mountains have risen since.

08:10.315 --> 08:12.734
And we should not measure the depth of the floodwaters ...

08:12.769 --> 08:15.118
... by the mountains that are present on Earth,

08:15.153 --> 08:19.367
which they were largely created during and after the Flood.

08:19.402 --> 08:23.830
Well, the fact that we have all these layers would be ...

08:23.865 --> 08:26.016
... unknown to us if we were ...

08:26.051 --> 08:28.548
... standing on them somewhere else ...

08:28.583 --> 08:31.045
but we know that they have been separated.

08:31.080 --> 08:32.594
How did that happen?

08:32.629 --> 08:34.674
Well, it's the story that we all learned ...

08:34.708 --> 08:36.682
... at school, yes?

08:36.717 --> 08:39.032
The Colorado River separated the Grand Canyon ...

08:39.067 --> 08:41.311
... for tens of millions of years.

08:41.346 --> 08:44.976
Most geologists have scrapped that idea.

08:45.011 --> 08:47.767
It's hard to keep a gun like this ...

08:47.802 --> 08:50.487
... for tens of millions of years.

08:50.522 --> 08:54.861
You can not imagine a cannon remain so long with erosion.

08:54.896 --> 08:56.546
Is it because eventually the sides ...

08:56.581 --> 08:58.197
... they had collapsed and collapsed?

08:58.232 --> 08:59.538
Yes.

08:59.573 --> 09:02.388
So how is that carved all this?

09:02.423 --> 09:05.168
Well, there are many theories, and personally ...

09:05.203 --> 09:10.209
... I like the idea of ​​catastrophic erosion drainage lakes.

09:11.418 --> 09:15.882
So after the flood we have these large bodies of water,

09:15.917 --> 09:17.672
some lakes that are trapped.

09:17.707 --> 09:19.391
There is evidence of the great lake ...

09:19.426 --> 09:22.436
... in the Painted Desert, a place called Hope Buttes,

09:22.471 --> 09:26.684
about 500 cubic miles of water in this huge lake.

09:26.719 --> 09:28.703
And then the dam breaks ...

09:28.738 --> 09:30.652
... and that massive amount of water ...

09:30.687 --> 09:34.609
... he is now pouring and carving it.

09:34.644 --> 09:35.866
Yes.

09:35.901 --> 09:38.112
And how long would erode the Grand Canyon?

09:38.147 --> 09:42.414
Maybe weeks, but not millions of years.

09:42.449 --> 09:45.577
Time is not a magic wand that solves ...

09:45.612 --> 09:48.670
... all geological problems in the world.

09:48.705 --> 09:52.257
Rejects that thinking about the millions of years ...

09:52.292 --> 09:55.797
... and then start thinking about catastrophic processes ...

09:55.832 --> 09:57.387
... as you see in the Mount St. Helens ...

09:57.422 --> 10:02.309
... and that will help you understand the Grand Canyon ...

10:02.344 --> 10:04.514
Every place we looked, Steve showed me evidence ...

10:04.549 --> 10:07.472
... the incredible power of moving water.

10:07.507 --> 10:10.395
They quickly settled those huge layers,

10:10.430 --> 10:12.397
and then quickly they eroded.

10:12.432 --> 10:13.695
Steve wanted to show ...

10:13.730 --> 10:16.109
... where in the floodwaters struck first continental crust,

10:16.144 --> 10:18.736
so he took me to a deeper place in the canyon.

10:20.445 --> 10:21.912
Steve, when you said to me ...

10:21.947 --> 10:24.283
... would you take to the bottom, you were kidding, right?

10:24.318 --> 10:25.874
We are in the bottom, right?

10:25.909 --> 10:30.373
We are in a great side canyon of the Grand Canyon main ...

10:30.408 --> 10:33.006
... and we are seeing the granite base,

10:33.041 --> 10:36.129
which is the core of the continental crust, so to speak,

10:36.164 --> 10:39.733
and then we see the above flat layers.

10:39.768 --> 10:42.724
The boundary between granite rock below ...

10:42.759 --> 10:45.644
... and Tapeats sandstone above is ...

10:45.679 --> 10:49.976
... this area we call the Great nonconformity.

10:50.011 --> 10:53.730
Why does it seem to be such a definite line?

10:53.770 --> 10:54.814
I mean, it is very clear.

10:54.855 --> 10:59.318
I think it is an erosional limit colossal scale.

10:59.359 --> 11:02.744
We are seeing something that shows the magnitude ...

11:02.779 --> 11:05.950
... flood flow over a surface.

11:05.991 --> 11:07.243
And you're just here?

11:07.284 --> 11:09.787
Great Dissatisfaction extends continentally.

11:09.822 --> 11:11.914
I've seen, I think, in the Middle East.

11:11.949 --> 11:13.579
It is in Europe.

11:13.614 --> 11:15.173
It is in Africa.

11:15.208 --> 11:18.046
And it is here under the North American continental crust.

11:18.081 --> 11:19.856
So we have this layer.

11:19.891 --> 11:21.632
How thick is this layer?

11:21.667 --> 11:23.015
What follows from this?

11:23.050 --> 11:25.803
Well, here we have the megasequence Sauk ...

11:25.838 --> 11:28.854
... thousand feet of sandstone, shale,

11:28.889 --> 11:31.767
limestone covering the entire continental crust.

11:31.802 --> 11:34.645
There are four other large packages sequences ...

11:34.680 --> 11:36.611
... strata that are on it.

11:36.646 --> 11:40.157
These are also continuous as this.

11:40.192 --> 11:44.030
What we are seeing here is fairly representative ...

11:44.065 --> 11:45.495
... the rest of the world.

11:45.530 --> 11:48.999
Makes one really question the notion ...

11:49.034 --> 11:51.829
... that all this happened for a small local flooding.

11:51.864 --> 11:53.795
We're talking about something huge.

11:53.830 --> 11:55.964
The power of moving water was beveling ...

11:55.999 --> 12:00.546
... and pulverizing rock, depositing a thick layer ...

12:00.581 --> 12:05.390
... and leading us to think in a global flood.

12:05.425 --> 12:08.638
However, the conventional story is completely different.

12:08.673 --> 12:11.283
He says there is a long time ...

12:11.318 --> 12:13.857
... between each of the layers.

12:13.892 --> 12:16.229
Some people have said that the limit of the Great Dissatisfaction ...

12:16.264 --> 12:18.665
... it represents five hundred million years.

12:18.700 --> 12:20.801
You mean between the granite we see ...

12:20.836 --> 12:22.866
... and that first layer of sedimentary rock?

12:22.901 --> 12:25.905
Yes. They say there could be five hundred million years,

12:25.940 --> 12:28.872
and that's what his explanation ...

12:28.907 --> 12:33.454
... in the history of the Earth I would ask them to consider,

12:33.489 --> 12:35.707
and yet, when you come here and look at this ...

12:35.742 --> 12:37.684
... it is almost a regular flat surface.

12:37.719 --> 12:39.591
Not exactly a flat surface,

12:39.626 --> 12:42.963
but it is a surface that undulates gently.

12:42.998 --> 12:46.300
Would that be the product of thousands of millions of years ...

12:46.335 --> 12:49.846
... or the product of the power of water ...

12:49.881 --> 12:51.978
... brushing a surface?

12:52.013 --> 12:57.019
Here time is alien for a good explanation,

12:57.054 --> 12:59.319
so we want to explain what we see.

12:59.354 --> 13:02.525
A wherever we look we see the power of water.

13:02.560 --> 13:05.200
And it's water on a colossal scale.

13:05.235 --> 13:08.071
And that's the story here at the Grand Canyon.

13:08.106 --> 13:10.908
Not a bit of water for a long time.

13:10.943 --> 13:14.162
It's a lot of water for a short time.

13:15.912 --> 13:17.879
Time is really the central problem ...

13:17.914 --> 13:20.090
... when we talk about the history of Earth.

13:20.125 --> 13:24.047
How long did form what we see around us?

13:24.082 --> 13:26.591
To me it seemed clear that the global Flood would ...

13:26.626 --> 13:28.473
... transformed the Earth quickly,

13:28.508 --> 13:30.350
and yet I know that many people think ...

13:30.385 --> 13:34.432
... that the world is slowly formed over thousands of millions of years.

13:34.467 --> 13:38.269
What was the real difference between these two ways of seeing the time?

13:38.304 --> 13:41.122
I needed to talk to someone who could tell me ...

13:41.157 --> 13:43.884
... more about science and history and time.

13:43.919 --> 13:46.611
Since my background is in computer science,

13:46.646 --> 13:47.784
we are in a place where I ...

13:47.819 --> 13:51.240
... he had personally experienced something in this story.

13:57.454 --> 13:58.914
As we watched the exhibition,

13:58.949 --> 14:00.339
I was reminded of how small ...

14:00.374 --> 14:02.293
... and that they have become powerful computers ...

14:02.328 --> 14:04.426
... since I used them for the first time.

14:04.461 --> 14:07.673
Paul said that changing our assumptions about computers ...

14:07.708 --> 14:10.468
... really it was a series of paradigm shifts.

14:10.503 --> 14:13.155
When I was 19 I read Thomas Kuhn's classic,

14:13.190 --> 14:15.807
"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions",

14:15.842 --> 14:18.940
He is describing the notion of paradigms.

14:18.975 --> 14:23.523
A paradigm is a framework in which you interpret the evidence.

14:23.558 --> 14:26.692
So science not only is the evidence;

14:26.727 --> 14:29.362
This is how you interpret the evidence.

14:29.397 --> 14:30.577
So, this room for example,

14:30.612 --> 14:32.656
we have here called "minicomputers"

14:32.691 --> 14:34.509
but really they are not mini at all ...

14:34.544 --> 14:36.327
... in terms of our current paradigm.

14:36.362 --> 14:38.951
Today, right?

14:38.986 --> 14:41.505
Yes this.

14:41.540 --> 14:44.919
So to really understand this question of origins ...

14:44.954 --> 14:47.130
... you really need to start watching ...

14:47.165 --> 14:49.096
... the ruling paradigms,

14:49.131 --> 14:51.926
both views we have now main ...

14:51.961 --> 14:54.721
... about the history of the life and history of the Universe.

14:54.756 --> 14:56.103
And which are they?

14:56.138 --> 14:59.606
On the one hand, we have the conventional paradigm.

14:59.641 --> 15:03.979
In the conventional paradigm you have a profound time,

15:04.014 --> 15:08.317
13.7 billion years together with this gradual ...

15:08.483 --> 15:10.506
... starting with the primitive simplicity ...

15:10.541 --> 15:12.494
... and ending with what we see today.

15:12.529 --> 15:16.159
All the complexity of life has to be built from below ...

15:16.194 --> 15:18.995
... for purely physical processes where no mind,

15:19.030 --> 15:22.921
no creator, no design is present.

15:22.956 --> 15:25.209
The second point of view we can call, say,

15:25.244 --> 15:27.926
the paradigm of historical Genesis.

15:27.961 --> 15:31.966
Everything starts with a divine mind, a creator,

15:32.001 --> 15:35.758
an intelligence that plans and directs ...

15:35.793 --> 15:39.479
... and it brings reality into existence.

15:39.514 --> 15:43.019
Events are happening at a much more recent time scale.

15:43.054 --> 15:47.029
The universe, the solar system, our planet, life itself,

15:47.064 --> 15:51.402
all starts fully formed as a functional system.

15:51.437 --> 15:53.738
It is not difficult to see that there is a radical difference ...

15:53.773 --> 15:56.487
... between these two in terms of time.

15:56.522 --> 15:59.166
When we see the history of life ...

15:59.201 --> 16:01.745
... on this planet, we have a body of data ...

16:01.780 --> 16:04.254
... but depending on the paradigm one adopts,

16:04.289 --> 16:07.585
the data will be interpreted in very different ways.

16:07.620 --> 16:10.052
It seems that a paradigm is ...

16:10.087 --> 16:14.237
... drawing on a story that was given to us ...

16:14.272 --> 16:18.388
... and the other paradigm is building this story.

16:18.423 --> 16:19.519
Is that how you see it?

16:19.554 --> 16:23.101
We have a witness to these events and that witness is us ...

16:23.136 --> 16:25.567
... I am saying this is what happened ...

16:25.602 --> 16:27.605
... and we have to take that into consideration ...

16:27.640 --> 16:29.696
... and then evaluate the data.

16:29.731 --> 16:34.444
Well, Paul, why this becomes something serious is ...

16:34.479 --> 16:39.158
... we're not talking about a story about boiling water ...

16:39.193 --> 16:40.457
... a certain temperature.

16:40.492 --> 16:43.454
We're talking about a story that is ...

16:43.489 --> 16:45.837
... with the origin of the universe.

16:45.872 --> 16:50.878
Deals with the origin of life; The origin of humanity;

16:50.961 --> 16:54.006
The origin of sin and why there is evil in the world;

16:54.041 --> 16:56.598
The origin of geological formations ...

16:56.633 --> 16:59.804
... we have around us; The origin of language.

16:59.839 --> 17:03.230
I mean, this is not just any story.

17:03.265 --> 17:06.519
He's dealing with very, very large elements of humanity ...

17:06.554 --> 17:07.770
... and where we are today.

17:07.805 --> 17:08.652
Yes.

17:08.686 --> 17:11.279
You're talking about the origins of literally everything.

17:11.314 --> 17:14.463
And I think if we turn away from all this and say, well,

17:14.498 --> 17:17.613
What it is really the difference between these two paradigms ?,

17:17.647 --> 17:20.163
It is not a question of science on one hand ...

17:20.198 --> 17:24.746
... against religion on the other because both are scientific in the sense ...

17:24.781 --> 17:27.123
... they are observing a common set of data.

17:27.157 --> 17:29.840
The most profound difference is really ...

17:29.875 --> 17:33.004
... Two historical views competing ...

17:33.039 --> 17:37.300
What is the true history of our cosmos?

17:37.335 --> 17:39.236
This seems to be the real question.

17:39.271 --> 17:41.137
What is our true story?

17:41.172 --> 17:43.437
What really happened?

17:43.472 --> 17:46.642
The conflict is not between two views of science,

17:46.677 --> 17:49.312
but between two views of history.

17:49.347 --> 17:51.519
Since Genesis was written in Hebrew,

17:51.554 --> 17:54.082
I wanted to talk to an expert in Hebrew.

17:54.117 --> 17:56.611
What really was the original text?

18:05.135 --> 18:08.357
The first word in Genesis is Braichit ...

18:09.448 --> 18:10.766
Genesis 1: 1 is Braichit.

18:13.435 --> 18:16.132
This is the beginning of Toledot Noah.

18:16.230 --> 18:18.762
That word Toledot, is a very interesting word.

18:18.874 --> 18:20.619
Sometimes it translated as "pedigrees".

18:20.709 --> 18:22.702
Sometimes it translated as "history".

18:23.061 --> 18:26.115
And what follows is the record of the Flood.

18:26.707 --> 18:31.364
Steve, it seems that there is much history in the Bible.

18:31.453 --> 18:32.646
Is that how you see it?

18:32.955 --> 18:33.948
Oh, absolutely.

18:34.248 --> 18:37.664
In fact, the first thing is that it is an accurate historical account.

18:38.544 --> 18:42.218
The presentation is such in the perspective of writers ...

18:42.256 --> 18:46.064
... they thought they were talking about real events.

18:46.443 --> 18:51.446
It is very obvious from the way they insisted ...

18:51.573 --> 18:54.473
... that the next generation learn its history.

18:55.035 --> 18:58.273
When you see those early chapters in Genesis,

18:58.288 --> 18:59.538
What do you see?

18:59.623 --> 19:00.882
Can you give us show?

19:01.308 --> 19:04.679
In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth ...

19:04.845 --> 19:07.140
No Hebrew word for the Universe.

19:07.175 --> 19:08.808
This means that He created everything.

19:09.433 --> 19:13.103
And the next thing we find in Genesis 1: 2 ...

19:13.138 --> 19:16.738
... it is a water ball in space.

19:16.773 --> 19:20.445
In the coming days, God will fill the universe.

19:20.480 --> 19:22.488
Well, here you are talking about days.

19:22.523 --> 19:24.579
Do you see this as literal days?

19:24.614 --> 19:26.575
Is this what the text is telling us?

19:26.610 --> 19:28.500
Or, you know, what other people think,

19:28.535 --> 19:31.622
this is just a poetic way of a different point of view?

19:31.657 --> 19:33.130
Well, first of all, is not poetry.

19:33.165 --> 19:36.169
All major Hebraists the world say ...

19:36.204 --> 19:38.010
... this is fiction.

19:38.045 --> 19:41.841
And they say that one of the unique features ...

19:41.876 --> 19:45.195
... the Genesis account of creation ...

19:45.230 --> 19:48.478
... and the Deluge is that they are narratives,

19:48.513 --> 19:51.934
because in the ancient East that was done in epic poetry,

19:51.969 --> 19:53.650
which is very different.

19:53.685 --> 19:58.649
And here we have a narrative to indicate that this is historic.

19:58.684 --> 20:02.117
What this means is that you understand the words ...

20:02.152 --> 20:04.489
... in the normal way these Hebrew words were understood.

20:04.524 --> 20:08.201
The word "yom" means day.

20:08.241 --> 20:11.621
The rationale for their use is what we refer to as day.

20:11.661 --> 20:13.170
It is a 24-hour day.

20:13.205 --> 20:14.629
The only way you'd want ...

20:14.664 --> 20:18.126
... means a longer period of time is ...

20:18.161 --> 20:21.589
... if you impose an alien concept to the text and say,

20:22.506 --> 20:25.515
Well, I think these are ages ...

20:25.550 --> 20:27.684
... so yom, it must mean ages.

20:27.719 --> 20:30.159
What you have to do is start with the text.

20:30.194 --> 20:32.600
If we start with the text, yom, it means day.

20:32.635 --> 20:35.359
So when we got to the passage ...

20:35.394 --> 20:40.400
... talking about the creation of Adam and Eve,

20:40.607 --> 20:44.946
You're seeing is a clear historical event ...

20:44.981 --> 20:46.578
... that would stand in direct opposition ...

20:46.613 --> 20:49.075
... the conventional paradigm that man evolved ...

20:49.110 --> 20:52.596
... from a long, long process.

20:52.631 --> 20:56.046
The biblical text does not support ...

20:56.081 --> 20:59.758
... with the conventional standard paradigm.

20:59.793 --> 21:03.423
The Bible teaches that the Lord God formed man,

21:03.458 --> 21:06.092
artfully blowing in the breath of life;

21:06.127 --> 21:07.557
created in His image.

21:07.592 --> 21:09.512
And then of course the woman is created.

21:09.547 --> 21:10.596
We marriage.

21:10.631 --> 21:12.312
We fall.

21:12.347 --> 21:15.518
And then in the genealogy of Noah we have the complete account of the Flood.

21:15.553 --> 21:17.019
And the Deluge, is a global flood?

21:17.054 --> 21:18.777
Well, I do not know how many times,

21:18.812 --> 21:22.191
35 times or so, the word "kol", which means "everything"

21:22.226 --> 21:23.782
It appears in the narrative of the Deluge.

21:23.817 --> 21:27.285
If this is a judgment on humanity, then it must be global.

21:27.320 --> 21:30.700
And as we go through these first eleven chapters of Genesis ...

21:30.735 --> 21:34.370
... we come to chapter ten, which is called the table of nations,

21:34.405 --> 21:36.461
who are the sons of Noah.

21:36.496 --> 21:39.020
It is mentioned in that chapter that people ...

21:39.055 --> 21:41.696
... they are in different nations and languages.

21:41.731 --> 21:44.619
So Moses returned in Genesis 11: 1-9 ...

21:44.654 --> 21:47.508
... and explains how languages ​​develop.

21:47.543 --> 21:50.809
So we arrived at Toledot of Terah ...

21:50.844 --> 21:54.474
... y el Toledot of Terah no va a ser acerca of Terah.

21:54.509 --> 21:57.816
It will be about his famous son, Abraham.

21:57.851 --> 22:01.564
It just seems so apparent that no ...

22:01.599 --> 22:03.625
... disconnect between all of these things ...

22:03.660 --> 22:05.615
... and everything we see in the beginning.

22:05.650 --> 22:09.489
It's just a long historical narrative.

22:09.524 --> 22:10.495
¿No?

22:10.530 --> 22:11.747
So is. In fact,

22:11.782 --> 22:14.875
pedigrees form the structure,

22:14.910 --> 22:17.580
not only for Genesis, but the narratives are ...

22:17.615 --> 22:18.879
... embedded in the genealogies.

22:18.914 --> 22:21.834
Genealogies are taken and calls the Toledot ...

22:21.869 --> 22:24.718
... in the book of Ruth to establish that David is ...

22:24.753 --> 22:29.759
... a descendant of Judah, something required by the prophecy of Jacob.

22:29.841 --> 22:31.906
And then we come to the New Testament.

22:31.941 --> 22:33.935
How the pedigree of Jesus set?

22:33.970 --> 22:38.393
With two genealogies, one that crosses the line of Mary ...

22:38.428 --> 22:40.567
... until Adam.

22:40.602 --> 22:44.314
Steve, in the light of all this we have seen,

22:44.349 --> 22:48.027
how important is the historical narrative ...

22:48.062 --> 22:49.701
... we found through Genesis,

22:49.736 --> 22:53.740
including all generations shown,

22:53.775 --> 22:57.745
How important is it for Christianity?

22:57.828 --> 22:58.830
This shows that Christianity ...

22:58.865 --> 23:00.671
... it has a historical basis.

23:00.706 --> 23:01.546
It is what the Scriptures say ...

23:01.581 --> 23:05.669
... and the scriptures represent actual historical data.

23:05.704 --> 23:10.212
So Christianity is not a leap in the dark.

23:10.247 --> 23:14.721
It is an understanding that has very strong historical bases,

23:14.756 --> 23:19.726
and that our Savior is our Creator.

23:20.434 --> 23:23.563
These genealogies are incredibly important.

23:23.598 --> 23:26.029
If Jesus is descended from Adam,

23:26.064 --> 23:28.776
and if Adam was created on the sixth day of creation,

23:28.811 --> 23:31.284
then the Earth can not be very old.

23:31.319 --> 23:33.948
So where do the millions of years?

23:34.948 --> 23:37.118
I met a geologist in a place where he said ...

23:37.153 --> 23:39.829
... we could understand this better.

23:45.917 --> 23:47.592
You see the stillness,

23:47.627 --> 23:51.596
the plain, nothing to bother.

23:51.631 --> 23:55.970
And yet you have the reminder that in the past was explosive.

23:56.005 --> 23:59.182
There was a volcano here behind a cinder cone volcano ...

23:59.217 --> 24:01.597
... and the volcano spewed lava flow ...

24:01.632 --> 24:03.978
... that spilled through the field.

24:04.013 --> 24:06.486
A lot of basaltic lava.

24:06.521 --> 24:09.156
Yes, but it is actually small compared ...

24:09.191 --> 24:12.695
... with lava flows we see in many places.

24:12.730 --> 24:16.199
And there are a thousand volcanoes around here ...

24:16.234 --> 24:17.742
... and the little that is behind us ...

24:17.777 --> 24:19.911
... we call cinder cone volcano.

24:19.946 --> 24:20.912
You call that small.

24:20.947 --> 24:21.877
Yeah, well, it is.

24:21.912 --> 24:23.795
These volcanoes are small.

24:23.830 --> 24:26.667
Mount St. Helens in 1980 when it erupted, well,

24:26.702 --> 24:30.010
2,500 feet from the summit of the volcano flew,

24:30.045 --> 24:33.341
but that was small compared with historical eruptions.

24:33.376 --> 24:35.766
We can go a little further back ...

24:35.801 --> 24:37.934
... to the great eruption of Yellowstone ...

24:37.969 --> 24:41.391
... and a part of the volcanic ash ended up in Texas.

24:41.426 --> 24:43.357
It reached that distance.

24:43.392 --> 24:46.360
Think lava flows in India ...

24:46.395 --> 24:50.030
... where you have an accumulation of up to one thousand feet ...

24:50.065 --> 24:54.862
... over an area measuring one third of the subcontinent of India.

24:54.897 --> 24:58.195
What we see in this is really just tiny ...

24:58.230 --> 25:01.572
... compared to what we have seen in the past ...

25:01.607 --> 25:04.878
... and that is saying something about the historical past.

25:04.913 --> 25:09.439
We can not use the present rhythms of these processes to understand ...

25:09.474 --> 25:13.965
... how fast and how majestically in terms of scale ...

25:14.000 --> 25:16.973
... the accumulated geological record.

25:17.008 --> 25:19.893
Well, that's the point that brought me to you ...

25:19.928 --> 25:23.349
... because how we determine the age of these rocks?

25:23.384 --> 25:26.817
Well, the important thing is to first recognize ...

25:26.852 --> 25:30.398
... This lava flow is in a sense a moment in time.

25:30.433 --> 25:31.905
It is an event.

25:31.940 --> 25:34.777
And when it is melted, you have all the different elements ...

25:34.812 --> 25:37.280
... leaving the volcano all mixed ...

25:37.315 --> 25:39.913
... and the rock begins to crystallize.

25:39.948 --> 25:42.680
Any of the atoms are radioactive ...

25:42.715 --> 25:45.377
... begin to accumulate in what we call ...

25:45.412 --> 25:47.796
... products son, the decay products.

25:47.831 --> 25:52.503
Now, the point is that the decay rate is so slow ...

25:52.538 --> 25:54.172
... where we measure in this ...

25:54.207 --> 25:56.722
... it takes millions of years ...

25:56.757 --> 26:00.156
... so that the atoms decay into atoms father son.

26:00.191 --> 26:03.520
And it is that where are the millions of years,

26:03.555 --> 26:06.934
that the decay rate at present is slow.

26:06.969 --> 26:09.145
But we would say that this is not ...

26:09.180 --> 26:10.569
... really the key to the past ...

26:10.604 --> 26:14.650
... because obviously the past contains some events ...

26:14.685 --> 26:17.987
... catastrophic mass that are not happening today.

26:18.022 --> 26:19.119
In fact, the Bible would say ...

26:19.154 --> 26:20.787
... the past is the key to the present.

26:20.822 --> 26:23.471
If you want to understand why the world is as it is today ...

26:23.506 --> 26:26.084
... you have to understand what happened in the past.

26:26.119 --> 26:29.957
So we have many clues that geological processes ...

26:29.992 --> 26:32.883
... they have not been in constant rates over time ...

26:32.918 --> 26:36.130
... and now we have other clues that decay rates ...

26:36.165 --> 26:38.305
... it could not have been constant.

26:38.340 --> 26:41.636
So we've taken rock samples from a variety of places.

26:41.671 --> 26:43.488
Many signs in the Grand Canyon ...

26:43.523 --> 26:45.306
... each of those layers of rock.

26:45.341 --> 26:46.772
I have done in New Zealand.

26:46.807 --> 26:49.107
We have done elsewhere in the world.

26:49.142 --> 26:53.815
And what we have done is to submit the same samples ...

26:53.850 --> 26:56.490
... more than one of these dating methods.

26:56.525 --> 26:58.986
And what we found is that in the same samples ...

26:59.021 --> 27:01.277
... with more than one method, we are getting dates ...

27:01.312 --> 27:03.757
... which they differ by hundreds of millions of years ...

27:03.792 --> 27:06.166
... and even billions of dollars in some cases.

27:06.201 --> 27:11.040
We are seeing big differences using different methods.

27:11.075 --> 27:13.873
Well, if there is that kind of difference ...

27:13.908 --> 27:16.635
... among all dating methods ...

27:16.670 --> 27:19.382
... then that it seems to confirm that in fact we ...

27:19.417 --> 27:21.300
... an open system here, no one closed.

27:21.335 --> 27:22.015
Right.

27:22.050 --> 27:24.721
And if we have an open system, then we can not trust him ...

27:24.756 --> 27:29.559
... to give us reliable dates for these rocks.

27:29.594 --> 27:31.441
And that changes the whole way of thinking ...

27:31.476 --> 27:34.813
... about the history of the Earth because suddenly ...

27:34.848 --> 27:38.115
... now these radioactive clocks are unreliable.

27:38.150 --> 27:41.368
We have evidence that the rate was faster in the past.

27:41.403 --> 27:45.163
Of suddenly we could not be thinking in terms of millions of years.

27:45.198 --> 27:49.328
We might be thinking in terms of a story that is much shorter.

27:49.363 --> 27:53.082
You were saying that this kind of evidence is ...

27:53.117 --> 27:54.959
... in the literature now.

27:54.994 --> 27:56.091
Yes Yes.

27:56.126 --> 27:58.128
Why you are not making an impact?

27:58.163 --> 28:00.095
Well, I've been wondering that ...

28:00.130 --> 28:03.009
... when I've spoken in geology departments of the universities ...

28:03.044 --> 28:06.679
... and the answer is that there is a commitment ...

28:06.714 --> 28:08.311
... with the millions of years.

28:08.346 --> 28:11.690
And so when people clung to that approach ...

28:11.725 --> 28:14.562
... anything outside his field of vision that conflicts ...

28:14.597 --> 28:18.691
... with that approach it is marginalized.

28:18.726 --> 28:19.656
And the reason why ...

28:19.691 --> 28:21.408
... the millions of years are important,

28:21.443 --> 28:25.572
If we go back in history of scientific thought,

28:25.607 --> 28:29.702
Charles Lyell in England proposed the millions of years ...

28:29.737 --> 28:31.960
... and they multiplied ages for rocks.

28:31.995 --> 28:35.603
And that was the foundation on which Charles Darwin built.

28:35.638 --> 28:39.212
In fact, he read Charles Lyell's book and became convinced ...

28:39.247 --> 28:41.553
... of millions of years of geological evolution ...

28:41.588 --> 28:44.425
... so now he could say that given enough time ...

28:44.460 --> 28:46.350
... what we see not happen in the present.

28:46.385 --> 28:48.554
Could see only small changes in the present.

28:48.589 --> 28:50.594
But if we have millions of years, small changes ...

28:50.629 --> 28:52.564
... they can accumulate to become big changes.

28:52.599 --> 28:55.770
So if you want to have a new way of looking at history ...

28:55.805 --> 28:58.790
... that says we arrived here by chance,

28:58.825 --> 29:01.740
random processes over millions of years,

29:01.775 --> 29:04.278
then you have to have rocks that are millions of years old.

29:04.313 --> 29:06.819
Otherwise you've undermined the whole foundation ...

29:06.854 --> 29:09.289
... that way of seeing the history of the Earth.

29:09.324 --> 29:11.911
So time becomes the critical element ...

29:11.946 --> 29:13.335
... for the conventional paradigm ...

29:13.370 --> 29:18.334
... and that time has to be a deep time.

29:18.959 --> 29:21.254
Andrew said that when studying the rock formations,

29:21.294 --> 29:24.090
One shows evidence of a young earth transformed ...

29:24.131 --> 29:27.015
... by a global catastrophe.

29:27.050 --> 29:31.639
So he took me south of Sedona for him to see with my own eyes.

29:31.680 --> 29:34.100
The important thing to note here is that ...

29:34.141 --> 29:38.396
... This landscape is really very stable.

29:38.437 --> 29:40.794
There was a lot of erosion in the past ...

29:40.829 --> 29:43.115
... to till this whole field,

29:43.150 --> 29:47.155
but those cliffs and valley floor are very stable,

29:47.190 --> 29:49.424
why we vegetation.

29:49.459 --> 29:51.623
Today everything is much, much quieter.

29:51.658 --> 29:54.960
Current processes are extremely slow ...

29:54.995 --> 29:57.879
... but they can not explain how we got this erosion,

29:57.914 --> 30:01.502
how do we get these layers, how do we get these cliffs.

30:01.537 --> 30:05.673
Okay, you wanted to come here because you saw the evidence ...

30:05.708 --> 30:09.761
... of a young Earth by what we found here.

30:09.796 --> 30:10.475
What do you see?

30:10.510 --> 30:12.721
Yes. Well, the first thing we noticed ...

30:12.756 --> 30:14.887
... it is the extension of these layers.

30:14.922 --> 30:16.982
It's like a stack of pancakes.

30:17.017 --> 30:19.401
For example, the red unit that crosses all ...

30:19.436 --> 30:23.441
... our view, that is the formation Schnebly Hill.

30:23.476 --> 30:26.361
And on it you can see it first white unit,

30:26.396 --> 30:28.613
Coconino Sandstone.

30:30.489 --> 30:33.749
And on the horizon you have the Kaibab limestone,

30:33.784 --> 30:36.329
which it is the rock on the surface of the Grand Canyon.

30:36.364 --> 30:40.333
And we are, 70 miles from the Grand Canyon here ...

30:40.368 --> 30:42.591
... and these layers are still here.

30:42.626 --> 30:47.632
It is hard to imagine the volume of material it represents.

30:48.298 --> 30:49.765
Yes.

30:49.800 --> 30:51.767
For instance, sandstone Coconino.

30:51.802 --> 30:55.348
We can trace it from here right through New Mexico,

30:55.383 --> 30:57.617
Colorado, up to Kansas ...

30:57.652 --> 30:59.816
... and Oklahoma, or even in Texas.

30:59.851 --> 31:02.444
We're talking about at least 200,000 square miles ...

31:02.479 --> 31:07.318
... consisting of a rocky drive for miles and miles and miles.

31:07.353 --> 31:09.529
That's not the scale we see today,

31:09.564 --> 31:11.828
with localized sedimentation.

31:11.863 --> 31:16.202
And to get this way is lying in such a large area,

31:16.237 --> 31:18.371
it's like having to do a pancake ...

31:18.406 --> 31:20.212
... at the same time very quickly.

31:20.247 --> 31:24.502
So these layers show evidence of rapid sedimentation,

31:24.537 --> 31:26.343
the extension of these layers.

31:26.378 --> 31:30.383
Well, Andrew, you were talking about that red training ...

31:30.418 --> 31:32.474
... but that does not sound familiar.

31:32.509 --> 31:34.011
No, that's the Schnebly Hill formation.

31:34.046 --> 31:35.644
Not in the Grand Canyon.

31:35.679 --> 31:40.685
At the Grand Canyon we Coconino formation Hermit.

31:40.726 --> 31:43.312
And that limit is sharp edge ...

31:43.347 --> 31:45.862
... and there is no evidence of erosion here,

31:45.897 --> 31:49.027
which means that the formation was deposited quickly Hermit ...

31:49.062 --> 31:52.780
... and then immediately Coconino was deposited thereon.

31:52.815 --> 31:56.701
But here we are 70 miles from the Grand Canyon ...

31:56.736 --> 31:58.911
... and we have this training Schnebly Hill ...

31:58.946 --> 32:01.368
... between Coconino and Hermit.

32:01.403 --> 32:03.755
And this training Schnebly Hill,

32:03.790 --> 32:08.588
800-1,000 feet thick in an area of ​​over 1,000 square miles ...

32:08.623 --> 32:11.174
... it must have been formed very quickly.

32:11.209 --> 32:13.765
If that took millions of years,

32:13.800 --> 32:15.684
we should see millions of years of evidence ...

32:15.719 --> 32:18.347
... of millions of years of erosion in the Grand Canyon ...

32:18.382 --> 32:19.807
... in that same limit.

32:19.842 --> 32:20.897
We not see it.

32:20.932 --> 32:24.102
So that means that this training Schnebly Hill ...

32:24.137 --> 32:27.290
... in this area it had to be formed in a matter of hours.

32:27.325 --> 32:30.443
So tells you it is not only lack of erosion ...

32:30.478 --> 32:32.743
... but there is no time between these limits.

32:32.778 --> 32:36.282
So the whole layer sequence was deposited very quickly.

32:36.317 --> 32:39.949
So we have this large expanse of layers.

32:39.984 --> 32:43.581
We have a lack of erosion between the layers.

32:43.616 --> 32:45.422
What other evidence do you see?

32:45.457 --> 32:48.008
Well, if we look at carefully, by example,

32:48.043 --> 32:50.880
Coconino Sandstone to, we stratification ...

32:50.915 --> 32:53.424
... there are bands in which they are inclined.

32:53.459 --> 32:55.714
We call cross-stratification.

32:55.749 --> 32:57.934
What they indicate is that you had ...

32:57.969 --> 33:01.140
... waves of sand under the water moved.

33:01.175 --> 33:03.315
The comparison is a desert.

33:03.350 --> 33:05.186
It is important to recognize that there is a difference ...

33:05.221 --> 33:07.778
... in the corner on a dune in the desert.

33:07.813 --> 33:11.859
It is usually from 30 to 34 degrees these inclined layers.

33:11.894 --> 33:15.380
Under water, it is usually 25 degrees or less.

33:15.415 --> 33:18.866
And Dr. John Whitmore has combed the hills ...

33:18.901 --> 33:20.499
... about their students ...

33:20.534 --> 33:24.205
... hundreds and hundreds of measurements of these cross stratifications ...

33:24.240 --> 33:28.584
... and all are in the range of 15-25 degrees.

33:28.619 --> 33:30.842
So it was a tank underwater.

33:30.877 --> 33:34.924
And so these layers are accumulating in hours, weeks ...

33:34.959 --> 33:38.278
... and in a few months, you have this whole lot ...

33:38.313 --> 33:41.597
... layers of pancakes on such broad areas.

33:41.632 --> 33:43.146
So the difference is not ...

33:43.181 --> 33:45.351
... it is to believe in these layers that exist.

33:45.386 --> 33:46.400
Not at all.

33:46.435 --> 33:48.271
The difference is in time, right?

33:48.306 --> 33:49.152
Right.

33:49.187 --> 33:52.531
It is not a matter of science against the Bible.

33:52.566 --> 33:53.573
When we are talking about the paradigm of the Flood ...

33:53.608 --> 33:57.029
... and the conventional paradigm, we are actually talking about ...

33:57.064 --> 34:00.450
... two different ways to see the history of the Earth.

34:00.485 --> 34:03.250
These views are very different.

34:03.285 --> 34:06.247
Of course, I thought being taught the conventional view ...

34:06.282 --> 34:09.851
... with their long periods and slow and uniform changes.

34:09.886 --> 34:13.420
But what is the history of the world according to Genesis?

34:24.514 --> 34:27.393
Kurt Wise took me a fascinating place to another ...

34:27.428 --> 34:29.955
... fossil evidence showing me forests,

34:29.989 --> 34:32.446
explaining the rapid formation of coal ...

34:32.481 --> 34:36.610
... and speaking of the complex design of biological systems.

34:36.646 --> 34:39.447
Wherever we looked, he taught me something new ...

34:39.482 --> 34:42.121
... about the Earth and its history.

34:42.157 --> 34:47.121
We ended up at the entrance of an old abandoned coal mine.

34:47.156 --> 34:48.795
This is what is ...

34:48.830 --> 34:51.667
... Company Dayton Coal and Iron, built ...

34:51.702 --> 34:54.217
... about 100-110 years ago.

34:54.252 --> 34:58.091
What is surprising is that if you did not know that story ...

34:58.126 --> 34:59.514
... and you looked at these rocks ...

34:59.549 --> 35:01.266
... you think they are very old.

35:01.301 --> 35:02.887
In fact, if we were in Greece you might think ...

35:02.922 --> 35:04.227
... that they are thousands of years old.

35:04.262 --> 35:07.558
It's hard to tell just by looking at the structure as such.

35:07.593 --> 35:11.287
Well, Kurt, then I need you to do something ...

35:11.322 --> 35:14.946
... because I know the conventional paradigm ...

35:14.981 --> 35:18.486
... look at the history of the Earth as a straight line.

35:18.521 --> 35:21.536
Many uniforms and other processes.

35:21.571 --> 35:24.534
But the story of Genesis tells us ...

35:24.569 --> 35:26.553
... that is not so uniform.

35:26.588 --> 35:28.502
Yes, that's a good point.

35:28.537 --> 35:32.709
In 2 Peter chapter 3 talks about people in the last days ...

35:32.744 --> 35:34.293
... they would say, "Where is the promise of his coming is?"

35:34.328 --> 35:36.093
"Ever since our fathers died in ...

35:36.128 --> 35:37.672
... all things continue as they were from the beginning of creation ".

35:37.707 --> 35:40.216
This concept of what you see in the present,

35:40.251 --> 35:41.682
what is happening now,

35:41.717 --> 35:43.636
what is happening in the creek down there,

35:43.671 --> 35:45.555
what is happening everywhere on Earth ...

35:45.590 --> 35:47.145
... it is the way it has always been.

35:47.180 --> 35:49.475
It has always been throughout the history of Earth.

35:49.510 --> 35:50.482
The passage continues,

35:50.517 --> 35:53.026
"But they deliberately ...".

35:53.061 --> 35:56.113
They are not only ignorant of these truths,

35:56.148 --> 35:58.860
they are rejecting these truths by the way,

35:58.895 --> 36:02.494
and lists Creation and the Flood.

36:02.529 --> 36:05.033
These are events that apparently, according to the Bible,

36:05.068 --> 36:07.457
are not as in the present.

36:07.492 --> 36:10.829
And how great is that's what we see here.

36:10.864 --> 36:14.131
That cliff is not really in place.

36:14.166 --> 36:17.754
That cliff is about 1,000 feet higher.

36:17.789 --> 36:19.756
He slid to where he is now.

36:19.791 --> 36:21.254
That's a big rock.

36:21.289 --> 36:22.681
It is immense. Huge.

36:22.716 --> 36:25.434
Now, what kind of process in this ...

36:25.469 --> 36:28.056
... slides down blocks as big as this?

36:28.091 --> 36:30.856
This thing still by a mile.

36:30.891 --> 36:35.110
But within these rocks there is more evidence of an event ...

36:35.145 --> 36:40.151
... before that it is even bigger, even more different than the present.

36:40.442 --> 36:44.906
And then you play within those there are fossils of a period of time ...

36:44.941 --> 36:46.705
... which is very different to the present.

36:46.740 --> 36:48.284
So according to the statements of Scripture ...

36:48.319 --> 36:50.208
... and according to my own experience ...

36:50.243 --> 36:53.414
... you can not use this to judge the past,

36:53.449 --> 36:54.755
to understand the past.

36:54.790 --> 36:55.881
But if you return to the beginning,

36:55.916 --> 36:58.675
you will realize that the Bible presents ...

36:58.710 --> 37:01.047
... what I would call times in the history of the Earth.

37:01.082 --> 37:02.262
Got big periods of time?

37:02.297 --> 37:04.175
Just different things going on ...

37:04.210 --> 37:06.183
... for each of those times.

37:06.218 --> 37:09.784
But if you live in any of those times never ...

37:09.819 --> 37:13.351
... would understand the previous time, because they are very different.

37:13.386 --> 37:16.851
The first is the creation itself.

37:16.886 --> 37:19.602
In six days God created the whole universe.

37:19.637 --> 37:22.318
He created the planets and the stars ...

37:22.353 --> 37:24.195
... and he unfolded the Universe ...

37:24.230 --> 37:25.994
... with his arm extended.

37:26.029 --> 37:28.157
That obviously is not happening today.

37:28.192 --> 37:30.457
He is not creating planets.

37:30.492 --> 37:32.751
In fact, at the end of that passage,

37:32.786 --> 37:36.088
He says he has finished his creative work.

37:36.123 --> 37:39.147
Then we move to what I call the Edenic period,

37:39.182 --> 37:42.171
the period of time that Adam and Eve are ...

37:42.206 --> 37:44.054
...in the garden of Eden.

37:44.089 --> 37:45.847
And it's very different than in the present.

37:45.882 --> 37:48.093
That passage, for example, gives us the impression ...

37:48.128 --> 37:50.304
... that if Adam and Eve had not sinned ...

37:50.339 --> 37:51.728
... they would have lived forever ...

37:51.763 --> 37:54.934
It is difficult to even conceive of humans living forever.

37:54.969 --> 37:56.644
So it's a different world.

37:56.679 --> 37:58.360
Completely different.

37:58.395 --> 38:00.273
But how long it did? We do not know.

38:00.308 --> 38:01.863
He ended suddenly ...

38:01.898 --> 38:03.859
... when Adam and Eve ate from the tree ...

38:03.894 --> 38:05.820
... the knowledge of good and evil ...

38:05.855 --> 38:08.444
... And God cursed creation.

38:08.479 --> 38:10.998
He changed the rules of the universe.

38:11.033 --> 38:14.084
The sun no longer be able to shine forever.

38:14.119 --> 38:16.294
We would no longer be able to live forever.

38:16.329 --> 38:19.834
So it's hard for us to even imagine what that would be ...

38:19.869 --> 38:21.794
... because we only see the laws that are present.

38:21.829 --> 38:23.629
And we would not have come to that conclusion ...

38:23.664 --> 38:24.964
... if we had the Word of God.

38:24.999 --> 38:26.013
That's true.

38:26.048 --> 38:27.967
And I think that that's what the Word of God ...

38:28.002 --> 38:29.599
... we have been given.

38:29.634 --> 38:32.972
And then we slid into the third period in time,

38:33.007 --> 38:35.022
what I call the antediluvian period,

38:35.057 --> 38:38.019
the period before the flood and after the fall of man.

38:38.054 --> 38:41.314
It is a world that is different than the present.

38:41.349 --> 38:43.530
They work the same natural laws,

38:43.565 --> 38:45.693
but it is a different set of creatures,

38:45.728 --> 38:47.483
a different set of plants.

38:47.518 --> 38:49.202
It's a little warmer Earth.

38:49.237 --> 38:51.532
The continents are in different positions ...

38:51.567 --> 38:53.206
... of which they are now.

38:53.241 --> 38:55.334
It is significantly different.

38:55.369 --> 38:58.998
And that's what we see in Peter, where he talks about ...

38:59.033 --> 39:01.876
... the world being destroyed.

39:01.917 --> 39:04.879
So the Flood not only wet everything.

39:04.920 --> 39:07.346
This was a really radical change, right?

39:07.381 --> 39:10.551
Yes, if we are right about what we have understood so far,

39:10.586 --> 39:12.517
we continents moving,

39:12.552 --> 39:15.687
bumping into each other, creating mountains.

39:15.722 --> 39:18.684
Towering mountains to reach tens of thousands of feet high.

39:18.719 --> 39:21.985
You have water rinsing entire continents.

39:22.020 --> 39:26.693
We are tearing tens of thousands of feet of sediment ...

39:26.728 --> 39:29.463
... of the old continent and then depositing ...

39:29.498 --> 39:32.198
... hundreds of feet of sediment over again.

39:32.233 --> 39:34.075
It's ... We're seeing earthquakes ...

39:34.110 --> 39:36.792
... amazing power.

39:36.827 --> 39:40.295
So that changed what you call ...

39:40.330 --> 39:45.253
... At the time of antediluvian to after the flood.

39:45.288 --> 39:47.627
Basically, the Earth has to ...

39:47.662 --> 39:49.648
... recover from the global Flood.

39:49.683 --> 39:51.598
The atmosphere has to recover.

39:51.633 --> 39:54.142
Geology, rocks, have to be recovered.

39:54.177 --> 39:57.181
Plants and animals have to spread around the Earth.

39:57.216 --> 40:00.101
Have plenty of water, huge earthquakes,

40:00.136 --> 40:01.817
huge volcanoes.

40:01.852 --> 40:06.274
And about that period of recovery it is a slow decline ...

40:06.309 --> 40:08.731
... in the intensity and frequency of these things.

40:08.766 --> 40:11.154
So it would be in this period in which we would see ...

40:11.189 --> 40:14.070
... the Ice Age, for example?

40:14.105 --> 40:16.612
Yes. Ironically, the Ice Age ...

40:16.647 --> 40:19.084
... turns out to be, in our model,

40:19.119 --> 40:23.875
a consequence of the heating of water during the flood.

40:23.910 --> 40:25.960
The water is evaporating from the oceans.

40:25.995 --> 40:27.592
That cools the ocean.

40:27.627 --> 40:29.630
The water then moves over the continental crust ...

40:29.665 --> 40:32.014
... leaving huge volumes of water fall.

40:32.049 --> 40:34.719
Now in some places the rain will fall like snow ...

40:34.754 --> 40:37.969
... but down so quickly and relentlessly ...

40:38.004 --> 40:41.148
... that can not melt and collects ...

40:41.183 --> 40:46.189
... sequences in thick ice until they reach the miles thick.

40:46.229 --> 40:48.857
And then when the oceans have cooled enough ...

40:48.892 --> 40:51.486
... generation system that rain has stopped,

40:51.521 --> 40:55.323
then these glaciers collapse on its own weight,

40:55.358 --> 40:57.283
melt at its current position,

40:57.318 --> 40:58.457
and they continue melting.

40:58.492 --> 41:01.057
This global warming is recovery.

41:01.092 --> 41:04.860
Earth is still recovering from the flood.

41:04.895 --> 41:08.628
So that was a pretty tumultuous era ...

41:08.794 --> 41:11.303
... but then you have a final time.

41:11.338 --> 41:16.344
Then the modern era, you can study the current processes ...

41:16.510 --> 41:19.513
... and understand things pretty easily ...

41:19.548 --> 41:22.481
... until after a couple of centuries the Flood.

41:22.516 --> 41:25.561
So that could make someone think that these processes,

41:25.596 --> 41:27.647
if you wear them all the way back ...

41:27.682 --> 41:28.445
Precisely.

41:28.480 --> 41:31.651
If you take the current processes and extend it to the past,

41:31.686 --> 41:33.784
and that's what 2 Peter says.

41:33.819 --> 41:35.154
That's the mistake that people.

41:35.189 --> 41:36.536
It is reasonable.

41:36.571 --> 41:38.741
Take this and spread it to the past.

41:38.776 --> 41:40.374
It is not unreasonable.

41:40.409 --> 41:42.876
So you have to go to the Bible ...

41:42.911 --> 41:46.623
... to find the information needed to reconstruct it.

41:46.658 --> 41:50.336
And, looking at it from the other side, if you start from the Bible,

41:50.371 --> 41:53.512
just the beginning of the story.

41:53.547 --> 41:56.342
God has given us the ability to read the rocks ...

41:56.377 --> 41:58.517
... and fill the rest of the story,

41:58.552 --> 42:01.478
and we need to fully understand the Flood.

42:01.513 --> 42:04.642
We start with the Bible, but then go to the rocks.

42:04.677 --> 42:07.245
Talk to the rocks and they will tell ...

42:07.280 --> 42:09.814
... what has happened in the past.

42:09.849 --> 42:11.571
Kurt had a point.

42:11.606 --> 42:13.740
The Bible records historical events ...

42:13.775 --> 42:16.591
... but it does not tell us how these events happened.

42:16.626 --> 42:18.913
That's what these scientists were doing.

42:18.948 --> 42:21.200
They were trying to interpret the evidence ...

42:21.235 --> 42:23.291
... in the light of biblical history.

42:23.326 --> 42:26.581
But Kurt said there was evidence within the rocks.

42:26.616 --> 42:28.541
What was that evidence?

42:39.801 --> 42:41.435
I love coming to the museums of natural history.

42:41.470 --> 42:45.141
For me as a paleontologist, it is like the opportunity to go to a zoo.

42:45.176 --> 42:48.394
They are all animals that lived before the Flood.

42:48.429 --> 42:50.819
It is an opportunity to travel in time.

42:50.854 --> 42:52.190
It's like a zoo, but they are not alive.

42:52.225 --> 42:53.322
They're all dead.

42:53.357 --> 42:56.194
And not stink, so that's very good.

42:56.229 --> 42:57.743
And the Museum of Natural History ...

42:57.778 --> 43:00.739
... not only he is telling us what was in there.

43:00.774 --> 43:04.177
It is also trying to give us a narrative line.

43:04.212 --> 43:07.439
And we have two possibilities, we have two paradigms ...

43:07.474 --> 43:09.988
... between a naturalistic vision and a biblical view.

43:10.023 --> 43:11.929
And all natural history museums in the country,

43:11.964 --> 43:13.836
most of which there are around the world,

43:13.871 --> 43:16.261
you only get one of those views,

43:16.296 --> 43:20.593
They only give you a naturalistic way of seeing the world, an old Earth.

43:20.628 --> 43:24.135
But the same data, this dinosaur is capable ...

43:24.170 --> 43:27.606
... to be understood in an alternative paradigm.

43:27.641 --> 43:29.936
So when I'm thinking about this kind of creatures ...

43:29.971 --> 43:32.643
... I'm thinking of a world just before the Flood.

43:32.678 --> 43:35.316
I mean, this is a real image of a violent world.

43:35.351 --> 43:36.657
Yes.

43:36.692 --> 43:38.611
This is why God said, behold, the end of all.

43:38.646 --> 43:40.494
It was not just humanity.

43:40.529 --> 43:42.865
Man and all the animals on which they were judged govern ...

43:42.900 --> 43:45.457
... at the time of the Flood.

43:45.492 --> 43:48.919
Well, Marcus, could you give us an overall picture ...

43:48.954 --> 43:52.291
... fossil and how all this fits in with the other?

43:52.326 --> 43:53.757
Yes.

43:53.792 --> 43:55.503
Fossils tend to be in different layers ...

43:55.538 --> 43:57.302
... where numbers are very, very large ...

43:57.337 --> 43:59.716
... that they have been destroyed, thousands of millions anonymous.

43:59.751 --> 44:02.349
So every time we see a layer of rock ...

44:02.384 --> 44:04.476
... it's so thick, we're thinking about ...

44:04.511 --> 44:07.849
... an event that probably took minutes to complete,

44:07.884 --> 44:09.481
not thousands of years.

44:09.516 --> 44:11.519
Minutes only for this unique package of rock,

44:11.554 --> 44:12.651
sometimes even seconds.

44:12.686 --> 44:14.987
Now, where these pulses Flood water are ...

44:15.022 --> 44:18.365
... moving on continental crust, taking ecosystems,

44:18.400 --> 44:22.405
or dragging up marine ecosystems from deep ocean ...

44:22.440 --> 44:25.116
... and pushing them toward Earth, and while one is deposited ...

44:25.151 --> 44:26.989
... the waves again, and they begin to push ...

44:27.024 --> 44:28.792
... and stack additional things about it.

44:28.827 --> 44:33.166
And it's cemetery on Cemetery on cemetery.

44:33.201 --> 44:35.674
It's one thing to talk about catastrophe,

44:35.709 --> 44:37.843
not a kind of thing where the fossil record ...

44:37.878 --> 44:41.090
... gradually builds bone by bone, shell by shell,

44:41.125 --> 44:43.593
slowly through countless eons of time.

44:43.628 --> 44:44.975
So you're saying we have ...

44:45.010 --> 44:49.599
... these marine fossils everywhere, even in the mountains.

44:49.634 --> 44:50.564
Yes.

44:50.599 --> 44:52.816
Further back in the Museum, they have sections ...

44:52.851 --> 44:56.272
... with things like mosasaurs, some large reptiles swimmers.

44:56.307 --> 44:58.024
Mosasaurs are distributed globally ...

44:58.059 --> 45:00.085
... and are distributed across continents.

45:00.120 --> 45:02.111
So you are seeing those things, you're saying ...

45:02.146 --> 45:03.744
... what has the power,

45:03.779 --> 45:06.580
what has the ability to make the marine world ...

45:06.615 --> 45:10.745
... and throw him on the continents of so violent and destructive way.

45:10.780 --> 45:12.535
And the Deluge fits perfectly here.

45:12.570 --> 45:14.290
When we were in the Grand Canyon,

45:14.325 --> 45:16.923
Great Dissatisfaction saw ...

45:16.958 --> 45:20.380
... and there were no fossils actually below that ...

45:20.415 --> 45:22.929
... and suddenly we started having many.

45:22.964 --> 45:26.094
What does that tell you as paleontologists?

45:26.129 --> 45:27.863
Well, the Great Dissatisfaction tells me ...

45:27.898 --> 45:29.561
... that there is some kind of massive erosion ...

45:29.596 --> 45:31.772
... and a course change is happening across the continent.

45:31.807 --> 45:34.852
And then when we started to get those beautiful sedimentary rocks ...

45:34.887 --> 45:36.396
... they have all the wonderful fossils in them,

45:36.431 --> 45:39.863
patterns begin to emerge.

45:39.898 --> 45:43.403
The ecosystem has the first animals on it ...

45:43.438 --> 45:44.993
... it comes very suddenly.

45:45.028 --> 45:46.697
In conventional Paleontology,

45:46.732 --> 45:48.330
they call the Cambrian Explosion.

45:48.365 --> 45:50.618
It is the first appearance of a wide variety ...

45:50.653 --> 45:52.834
... different marine animals.

45:52.869 --> 45:54.956
Suddenly you have this complex and complete ecosystem ...

45:54.991 --> 45:57.750
... that basically comes out of nowhere.

45:57.785 --> 45:58.382
This makes perfect sense ...

45:58.417 --> 46:00.523
... from a perspective of Creation and the Flood ...

46:00.558 --> 46:02.594
... because the Flood is destroying ecosystems,

46:02.629 --> 46:05.800
while in the evolutionary view, these ecosystems have to ...

46:05.835 --> 46:08.225
... a little more gradually emerge ...

46:08.260 --> 46:10.972
... as organizations evolve and diversify ...

46:11.007 --> 46:13.182
... and they meet each other in their environment.

46:13.217 --> 46:14.898
But that's not what you see.

46:14.933 --> 46:19.939
Instead you see an explosion of life that is complex, full,

46:20.856 --> 46:23.156
the ecosystem is integrated with each other.

46:23.191 --> 46:27.363
You can see where all the different bodies fit each other.

46:27.398 --> 46:30.080
And that's only the first time that happens.

46:30.115 --> 46:32.701
Each time you gain a level in the geologic column,

46:32.736 --> 46:35.288
in the fossil record, you start to see screenshots ...

46:35.323 --> 46:37.004
... more and more ecosystems.

46:37.039 --> 46:40.688
You have an ecosystem is destroyed and then have another.

46:40.723 --> 46:43.531
Has slightly different creatures, there are interactions.

46:43.566 --> 46:46.340
And as the floodwaters rise and rise ...

46:46.375 --> 46:48.181
... They are coming closer and closer to the coast ...

46:48.216 --> 46:50.887
... destroying more and more organisms in the coastline ...

46:50.922 --> 46:52.978
... and eventually on Earth.

46:53.013 --> 46:55.814
I think I see what you're saying ...

46:55.849 --> 46:59.484
And is that the paradigm that all teach us,

46:59.519 --> 47:02.070
this conventional paradigm is trying to tell us ...

47:02.105 --> 47:05.991
... that the fossil record is an evolutionary picture of life ...

47:06.026 --> 47:10.573
... as is being developed in the opposite way to the paradigm of Genesis ...

47:10.608 --> 47:12.581
... he is saying no, all that life,

47:12.616 --> 47:14.833
the complexity of life was already there ...

47:14.868 --> 47:18.539
... and we are now seeing the cemetery of all that life.

47:18.574 --> 47:19.629
Exactly.

47:19.664 --> 47:20.839
Well, what other data ...

47:20.874 --> 47:24.509
... you can see that you are convinced this paradigm?

47:24.544 --> 47:28.216
Well, very curious situation with the fossil record ...

47:28.251 --> 47:30.724
... vertically thinking about these things ...

47:30.759 --> 47:34.931
... are not the rigid parts of the animal, but the set of footprints.

47:34.966 --> 47:36.730
They are the footprints.

47:36.765 --> 47:39.066
There is a pattern we see in several different groups ...

47:39.101 --> 47:42.897
... where the tracks are first and bodies are later.

47:42.932 --> 47:45.989
For trilobites, amphibians, for dinosaurs,

47:46.024 --> 47:48.444
the first time they encounter evidence in the fossil record ...

47:48.479 --> 47:51.620
... it is of his footprints, not the rigid parts.

47:51.655 --> 47:54.929
From the perspective of old Earth that's very strange ...

47:54.964 --> 47:58.168
... and difficult to sustain because you have millions of years ...

47:58.203 --> 48:02.750
... between production set of footprints and animal he made them.

48:02.791 --> 48:05.294
But that obviously does not make much sense ...

48:05.329 --> 48:07.094
... because if there are footprints, there are animals,

48:07.129 --> 48:09.340
and these animals have bones and teeth, and shells on them.

48:09.375 --> 48:10.842
Why they are not fossilized?

48:10.882 --> 48:13.344
Instead, the pattern is telling us something different.

48:13.379 --> 48:16.097
No time between when someone leaves a trail ...

48:16.138 --> 48:17.432
... and when someone is buried.

48:17.472 --> 48:19.851
But the fact that these sets of footprints are still there,

48:19.891 --> 48:21.853
That should tell us something too, right?

48:21.893 --> 48:23.944
First, it tells us that the deposit ...

48:23.979 --> 48:26.655
... or the positioning of the next layer above ...

48:26.690 --> 48:31.029
... it must have happened very, very quickly because, again, you go to a beach,

48:31.064 --> 48:35.199
and you walk in the sand, your fingerprints are destroyed very, very fast.

48:35.234 --> 48:37.410
But the fossil record is showing us ...

48:37.445 --> 48:39.203
... something very different from the present.

48:39.238 --> 48:40.493
This is death at a time.

48:40.528 --> 48:41.712
This is death in an instant.

48:41.747 --> 48:43.750
And we're talking about a world that was ...

48:43.785 --> 48:46.008
... complex, comprehensive, integrated ...

48:46.043 --> 48:49.756
... and the Flood is destroying the world sequentially ...

48:49.791 --> 48:51.805
... and burying vertically.

48:51.840 --> 48:54.433
So I think looking at the fossil record ...

48:54.468 --> 48:57.722
... as a record of life is partially correct ...

48:57.757 --> 48:59.438
... but not about the development of life.

48:59.473 --> 49:02.060
It is about the attempt of life to survive an event ...

49:02.095 --> 49:05.229
... that ultimately he consumed completely.

49:05.264 --> 49:07.269
Well, that would make sense then ...

49:07.304 --> 49:09.833
... because when God spoke ...

49:09.868 --> 49:12.326
... to destroy the Earth with the flood,

49:12.361 --> 49:14.864
was not only the destruction of human life,

49:14.899 --> 49:17.456
It was the destruction of all life.

49:17.491 --> 49:20.995
And now the world in which we live is, as you said,

49:21.030 --> 49:22.955
radically different than it was before.

49:22.990 --> 49:23.879
Yes.

49:23.914 --> 49:26.089
When we look at the T-Rex, when we look at Mosasaur,

49:26.124 --> 49:29.504
When we look at all these animals like wild carnivores,

49:29.539 --> 49:32.420
and they really are ... I mean, they are terrifying ...

49:32.455 --> 49:35.265
... but that's not what we were created to be.

49:35.300 --> 49:38.638
So those sharp teeth, claws such devastating ...

49:38.673 --> 49:40.145
... and behaviors that accompany them,

49:40.180 --> 49:43.810
everything seems to be part of the curse, and part of that is genetic.

49:43.845 --> 49:47.101
Part of it could also be some modifications.

49:47.136 --> 49:50.358
But these agencies, by the time we see them,

49:50.393 --> 49:51.657
and it is important to remember this ...

49:51.692 --> 49:53.325
... when you come to a Museum of Natural History,

49:53.360 --> 49:56.321
you're not seeing the world in the creation week.

49:56.356 --> 49:59.283
You're seeing the world as it existed in the Flood,

49:59.318 --> 50:02.125
and that was a world full of violence,

50:02.160 --> 50:05.754
and it was a really terrible place to live.

50:05.789 --> 50:08.298
I realized that the thousands of millions of creatures ...

50:08.333 --> 50:11.379
... buried in these layers are silent testimony ...

50:11.414 --> 50:13.798
... the overall judgment of God.

50:13.833 --> 50:14.763
I decided I wanted to see ...

50:14.798 --> 50:17.968
... one of those layers of fossils with my own eyes.

50:18.003 --> 50:21.139
If dinosaurs died suddenly in the Flood,

50:21.174 --> 50:23.558
Would not it be obvious?

50:29.938 --> 50:31.565
What we are dealing with here,

50:31.600 --> 50:33.156
This is the Lance Formation,

50:33.191 --> 50:37.786
is an Upper Cretaceous sedimentary deposit.

50:37.821 --> 50:40.664
And what we have here is what is called a deposit of bones.

50:40.699 --> 50:44.746
A bone accumulation having about one meter thick,

50:44.781 --> 50:46.294
less than a meter,

50:46.329 --> 50:48.547
and in this meter bones are present,

50:48.582 --> 50:50.918
as a stratum graduate with small up bones ...

50:50.953 --> 50:54.022
... and the larger bones in the background.

50:54.057 --> 50:56.387
And here you can see that Erline is ...

50:56.422 --> 50:58.682
... working with other vertebrate.

50:58.717 --> 51:01.512
This is a cervical vertebra of a duckbill dinosaur.

51:01.547 --> 51:04.866
This is where the spinal cord is.

51:04.901 --> 51:08.150
When I see these bones in the quarry,

51:08.185 --> 51:12.899
often I imagine being inside the live animal ...

51:12.934 --> 51:15.523
... and I imagine what it would be ...

51:15.558 --> 51:18.076
... seeing these bones for the first time.

51:18.111 --> 51:20.927
So this is full of bones, and it's not like ...

51:20.962 --> 51:23.743
... we have to go find where the bones are.

51:23.778 --> 51:28.337
We just have to sit down and start digging.

51:28.372 --> 51:30.917
What is the main difference between sites ...

51:30.952 --> 51:34.009
... you're digging here and, say,

51:34.044 --> 51:37.214
general dinosaur excavation somewhere?

51:37.249 --> 51:40.349
Well, the dinosaurs are found throughout the world,

51:40.384 --> 51:43.935
but this particular site is unique because it probably ...

51:43.970 --> 51:47.934
... it is one of the largest collections of bones worldwide.

51:47.969 --> 51:49.733
And here are the remains ...

51:49.768 --> 51:52.480
... of, I would say, between 5,000 and 10,000 animals ...

51:52.515 --> 51:56.490
... every 20-40 feet in this tank.

51:56.525 --> 51:59.987
These are large animals, and there are many of them.

52:00.022 --> 52:02.329
Let's stop for a second.

52:02.364 --> 52:06.160
Okay, then we have a duckbill dinosaur wandering ...

52:06.195 --> 52:08.746
... the Earth, and suddenly dies.

52:08.781 --> 52:10.879
Would he become a fossil?

52:10.914 --> 52:14.424
Fossilization requires very special circumstances.

52:14.459 --> 52:18.798
Normally we know that, for example, if a coyote dies in the desert,

52:18.833 --> 52:21.098
your body quickly disappears.

52:21.133 --> 52:24.429
And yet these bones are perfectly preserved.

52:24.464 --> 52:26.347
They have never been exposed to the weather.

52:26.382 --> 52:27.729
They are all there.

52:27.764 --> 52:31.436
Today it would be hard to imagine how you could get this.

52:31.471 --> 52:33.021
To some extent we could really say ...

52:33.056 --> 52:35.165
... to find a fossil is rare.

52:35.200 --> 52:37.280
Although we have many, many fossils ...

52:37.315 --> 52:39.324
... in terms of things that die,

52:39.359 --> 52:41.446
It is uncommon to become fossils.

52:41.481 --> 52:42.536
It's not Common.

52:42.571 --> 52:44.538
It requires special circumstances,

52:44.573 --> 52:47.624
one of which is the rapid burial.

52:47.659 --> 52:51.998
These animals had to be killed and then their bodies ...

52:52.033 --> 52:53.630
... needed time to decompose.

52:53.665 --> 52:55.877
So we're talking about days or weeks or months ...

52:55.912 --> 52:59.803
... where the bones and tissues ...

52:59.838 --> 53:02.514
... or were eaten or decomposed ...

53:02.549 --> 53:06.971
... and then the bones were deposited instantly ...

53:07.006 --> 53:10.141
... in this environment because they are in a graded layer ...

53:10.176 --> 53:11.726
... down with big bones and small bones up.

53:11.761 --> 53:12.816
And you can see this here.

53:12.851 --> 53:14.645
Large bones are way down ...

53:14.680 --> 53:16.685
... and when they start to dig here,

53:16.720 --> 53:18.655
They begin to find small bones.

53:18.690 --> 53:22.548
So those conditions require a classification process ...

53:22.583 --> 53:26.407
... which can only take place during a catastrophic replacement.

53:26.442 --> 53:29.160
So when we see dinosaur fossils,

53:29.195 --> 53:31.429
instead of seeing them from the perspective ...

53:31.464 --> 53:33.628
... that we have early dinosaurs,

53:33.663 --> 53:36.834
then dinosaurs means, then later dinosaurs,

53:36.869 --> 53:39.792
you watch them from the perspective ...

53:39.827 --> 53:42.679
... that all these dinosaurs existed,

53:42.714 --> 53:45.843
all were living, and then there was a huge catastrophe ...

53:45.878 --> 53:47.809
... that led to an end.

53:47.844 --> 53:49.846
Dinosaurs dinosaurs were already ...

53:49.881 --> 53:51.813
... when they first appeared.

53:51.848 --> 53:55.520
They look like you'd think a dinosaur looks.

53:55.555 --> 53:57.819
And this is a conundrum for those ...

53:57.854 --> 54:00.364
... who they believe in the evolution of dinosaurs.

54:00.399 --> 54:03.736
But we hear a lot about transitional forms.

54:03.771 --> 54:06.495
What is the real story here?

54:06.530 --> 54:10.040
Scientists have been able to expose some ways ...

54:10.075 --> 54:13.705
... they think they are transitional, and some of them are ...

54:13.740 --> 54:16.457
... very interesting and some even challenging,

54:16.492 --> 54:18.507
but they are the exception to the rule.

54:18.542 --> 54:20.920
The rule is that no transitional fossils.

54:20.955 --> 54:23.387
What we find in the fossil record ...

54:23.422 --> 54:27.844
... and contrary to the hopes of Darwin, this is the rule ...

54:27.879 --> 54:30.972
... it is that a way exists in the fossil record,

54:31.007 --> 54:32.887
It remains basically unchanged ...

54:32.922 --> 54:34.767
... and disappears from the fossil record ...

54:34.802 --> 54:36.400
... without being changed.

54:36.435 --> 54:39.480
That has to mean more than evolution ...

54:39.515 --> 54:42.150
... because we never see changes in a way ...

54:42.185 --> 54:45.111
... another way rocks as such.

54:45.146 --> 54:47.869
So it comes from elsewhere.

54:47.904 --> 54:51.908
It is a paradigm that has been imposed on the data ...

54:51.943 --> 54:55.877
... rather than data provide the paradigm.

54:55.912 --> 54:59.083
So I think it's very easy for me to be a creationist ...

54:59.118 --> 55:01.290
... simply based on my understanding ...

55:01.325 --> 55:03.463
... the complexity of life forms.

55:03.498 --> 55:04.678
And when we look at the fossil record,

55:04.713 --> 55:07.550
we can see that the complexity is there from the beginning ...

55:07.585 --> 55:09.599
... and this makes us wonder:

55:09.634 --> 55:12.555
Where did all this complexity?

55:12.590 --> 55:14.104
Una cosa es tener fe.

55:14.139 --> 55:17.107
I have faith that God was the creator,

55:17.142 --> 55:20.229
but that is sustained by what I see around me.

55:20.264 --> 55:23.280
Say I have faith that evolution produced this ...

55:23.315 --> 55:27.612
... when I can not even see how it could have happened, that's blind faith.

55:27.647 --> 55:31.199
That is a leap in the dark.

55:32.157 --> 55:35.453
It seemed that everywhere we looked was growing evidence ...

55:35.488 --> 55:38.539
... that fits with the historical record of Genesis.

55:38.574 --> 55:40.505
It was not just one thing:

55:40.540 --> 55:43.800
There were many things pointing in the same direction.

55:43.835 --> 55:46.422
When I was with Art, he told me about some recent discoveries ...

55:46.457 --> 55:49.556
... on the material inside the bones of dinosaurs,

55:49.591 --> 55:52.679
so I went to a lab in Arizona to talk to a scientist ...

55:52.714 --> 55:55.598
... he's doing some of that research.

55:59.601 --> 56:02.437
This is a fragment Triceratops horn.

56:02.472 --> 56:05.238
When we took him out of the earth, fragmented ...

56:05.273 --> 56:07.694
... and then obviously we had to keep fragmenting ...

56:07.729 --> 56:09.660
... for analysis.

56:09.695 --> 56:14.033
In 2012, the Society of Creationist Research sponsored Mark Armitage ...

56:14.068 --> 56:17.616
... and me to go to Hell Creek formation in Montana,

56:17.651 --> 56:21.165
a place famous for finding dinosaur bones,

56:21.200 --> 56:22.798
and instead we dug up ...

56:22.833 --> 56:27.380
... a horn of nearly four feet in length eye socket of a Triceratops.

56:27.415 --> 56:30.347
It is now shattered ...

56:30.382 --> 56:33.553
... so we can not really put it together and show a horn,

56:33.588 --> 56:37.932
but still you have to recognize that in pieces like this,

56:37.967 --> 56:42.895
we found tissue cells.

56:43.270 --> 56:44.069
Oh, that's amazing.

56:44.104 --> 56:47.364
And potentially proteins like collagen.

56:47.399 --> 56:51.049
It is very difficult to understand how this material could have ...

56:51.084 --> 56:54.699
... still in a dinosaur fossil that was supposed to ...

56:54.734 --> 56:59.209
... 65, 75, 80 million years old ...

56:59.244 --> 57:04.208
because the tissue, cells, proteins are degraded.

57:04.416 --> 57:05.966
They are not concrete.

57:06.001 --> 57:08.003
They do not exist for eons of time.

57:08.038 --> 57:09.970
Decompose and, in fact,

57:10.005 --> 57:11.694
tend to break down very fast ...

57:11.729 --> 57:13.384
... depending on conditions,

57:13.425 --> 57:16.304
and certainly in Hell Creek conditions would be ...

57:16.339 --> 57:18.973
... heated, cooled, heated, cooled.

57:19.008 --> 57:20.772
And any biochemist can tell you ...

57:20.807 --> 57:23.623
... this is the easiest way to destroy material.

57:23.658 --> 57:26.439
It's hard enough to imagine that survive ...

57:26.480 --> 57:28.649
... 4 or 5000 years

57:28.690 --> 57:31.361
But did 60 million years? ¿70 million years?

57:31.401 --> 57:33.821
That really becomes very difficult to present ...

57:33.862 --> 57:38.826
... any kind of biochemical basis for how he could have survived.

57:39.493 --> 57:44.457
Okay, then, once you find a sample like this,

57:44.664 --> 57:46.131
what do you do next?

57:46.166 --> 57:50.004
What we do is dip the fossil material ...

57:50.039 --> 57:53.430
... in a solution called EDTA.

57:53.465 --> 57:56.302
And then you'll have after dissolving the fossil ...

57:56.337 --> 57:57.768
... it is that the tissue remains ...

57:57.803 --> 57:59.972
... that the EDTA will not dissolve the fabric.

58:00.007 --> 58:01.229
So we took this to ...

58:01.264 --> 58:06.109
... what we call a dissecting microscope.

58:06.144 --> 58:11.150
This is essentially a dissolved Triceratops horn and increased ...

58:12.109 --> 58:14.716
... so you can see how it looks.

58:14.751 --> 58:17.287
Just like small pieces of rock.

58:17.322 --> 58:21.208
Well Kevin, what did you find when you were ...

58:21.243 --> 58:24.789
... watching the shows and find some tissue?

58:24.824 --> 58:27.255
Well, this is what we found.

58:27.290 --> 58:29.877
This is really Triceratops tissue.

58:29.912 --> 58:31.438
It is stretchable.

58:31.473 --> 58:32.928
It is flexible.

58:32.963 --> 58:36.968
There is an impression of dinosaur soft tissue.

58:37.003 --> 58:39.387
It's really soft. It is soft.

58:39.422 --> 58:41.853
It is stretchable. It is tissue.

58:41.888 --> 58:42.890
So you really wonder, right?

58:42.925 --> 58:44.314
Absolutely.

58:44.349 --> 58:49.152
And if you see a greater increase ...

58:49.187 --> 58:53.067
... then you can see, using scanning electron microscopy,

58:53.102 --> 58:56.696
You can see the extreme detail of cells ...

58:56.731 --> 58:59.153
... in this picture and this picture ...

58:59.188 --> 59:01.540
... and in particular, look at this picture.

59:01.575 --> 59:04.328
We not expect, nor would think even see ...

59:04.363 --> 59:07.921
... such a large and elaborate detail.

59:07.956 --> 59:10.668
I mean that these structures are incredibly small.

59:10.703 --> 59:13.135
This is our bar 20 microns ...

59:13.170 --> 59:16.507
... and look how small these structures are still intact.

59:16.542 --> 59:18.974
It would take very little break them down.

59:19.009 --> 59:21.179
So you expect the best of cases all that ...

59:21.214 --> 59:23.431
... it was broken and disappeared long ago.

59:23.466 --> 59:26.347
This must have shaken ...

59:26.382 --> 59:29.192
... the scientific community.

59:29.227 --> 59:31.737
What has been the response to this?

59:31.772 --> 59:34.567
The initial response when Dr. Schweitzer ...

59:34.602 --> 59:36.867
... he published his first work,

59:36.902 --> 59:40.615
What was it that was very popular in 2005,

59:40.650 --> 59:42.414
He generated much response.

59:42.449 --> 59:46.412
So initially something of response was rejection.

59:46.447 --> 59:48.170
Oh, it is contamination.

59:48.205 --> 59:50.172
That's not really dinosaur.

59:50.207 --> 59:53.586
It is bacteria, because bacteria can be ...

59:53.621 --> 59:55.344
... a little weird sometimes.

59:55.379 --> 59:59.264
So there were many proposals for what could be.

59:59.299 --> 01:00:04.263
And to his credit, Dr. Schweitzer did more research.

01:00:04.298 --> 01:00:06.116
They started to find protein.

01:00:06.151 --> 01:00:07.898
Pop them some of these cells,

01:00:07.933 --> 01:00:10.978
observe the matrix to which the cells are attached ...

01:00:11.013 --> 01:00:12.778
... and it is protein.

01:00:12.813 --> 01:00:17.819
Okay, so once we understand this, what happens?

01:00:18.485 --> 01:00:20.285
That really shook everything I guess.

01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:22.906
That becomes part of the controversy ...

01:00:22.941 --> 01:00:25.457
... because now clearly you face ...

01:00:25.492 --> 01:00:28.335
... how can you explain the survival of this ?,

01:00:28.370 --> 01:00:33.376
the complete survival of this not only for long,

01:00:33.458 --> 01:00:35.794
but not immaculate condition.

01:00:35.829 --> 01:00:38.131
And so the controversy has been,

01:00:38.166 --> 01:00:39.763
"How do you explain it?".

01:00:39.798 --> 01:00:42.808
And if you read some of the literature,

01:00:42.843 --> 01:00:45.554
there is almost desperation because they recognize ...

01:00:45.589 --> 01:00:48.230
... what could be the implications of this.

01:00:48.265 --> 01:00:50.685
Now some people might say that this means nothing ...

01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:52.150
... because we know how old you are ...

01:00:52.185 --> 01:00:54.188
... and then it just seems that somehow survived.

01:00:54.223 --> 01:00:55.654
It's not so bad.

01:00:55.689 --> 01:00:57.155
But how do you know how old are they?

01:00:57.190 --> 01:00:59.736
You use these methods, assumptions dating methods.

01:00:59.771 --> 01:01:01.535
Well, this is a dating method.

01:01:01.570 --> 01:01:03.906
The fabric itself can not be ruled ...

01:01:03.941 --> 01:01:05.539
... as part of a dating method.

01:01:05.574 --> 01:01:08.932
So, why they say this when they do not have an account?

01:01:08.967 --> 01:01:12.290
Well, it's because the paradigm takes you to your conclusions.

01:01:12.325 --> 01:01:13.755
The paradigm is that it has to be old,

01:01:13.790 --> 01:01:18.129
so we choose the methods that give us an old fossil.

01:01:18.164 --> 01:01:21.066
Something that does not give us an old fossil, such as weaving,

01:01:21.101 --> 01:01:23.932
we must reject it or explain it otherwise.

01:01:23.967 --> 01:01:26.971
At least for me, and of course, I'm not a microbiologist,

01:01:27.006 --> 01:01:29.640
but I think most people would say ...

01:01:29.675 --> 01:01:32.024
... it seems reasonable to think ...

01:01:32.059 --> 01:01:34.693
... maybe they are not so old.

01:01:34.728 --> 01:01:39.317
This clearly violates the dating process.

01:01:39.352 --> 01:01:42.117
Reta whole dating process.

01:01:42.152 --> 01:01:45.740
If dinosaur fossils have been dated incorrectly

01:01:45.775 --> 01:01:48.457
and I would say this is clear evidence that they have been,

01:01:48.492 --> 01:01:53.039
then it is very likely that fossils of any organism ...

01:01:53.074 --> 01:01:54.379
... han been incorrectly dated

01:01:54.414 --> 01:01:57.501
and then the same geological eras are incorrect.

01:01:57.536 --> 01:02:00.588
What you're saying is that if you take the notion ...

01:02:00.623 --> 01:02:03.764
... a long period of time,

01:02:03.799 --> 01:02:08.805
you are drawing a great foundation of the conventional paradigm.

01:02:09.554 --> 01:02:10.729
Absolutely.

01:02:10.764 --> 01:02:15.770
In fact, time is the critical component of evolution.

01:02:16.103 --> 01:02:20.906
If you're going to say a simple cellular system ...

01:02:20.941 --> 01:02:25.154
... it became a multicellular system, which then turned into fish,

01:02:25.189 --> 01:02:28.038
and then the fish jumped to Earth ...

01:02:28.073 --> 01:02:30.243
... and they grew legs and started breathing air,

01:02:30.278 --> 01:02:33.579
and then that creature he grew feathers ...

01:02:33.614 --> 01:02:35.170
... and wings and he began to fly.

01:02:35.205 --> 01:02:39.675
So if you give us time, we realize ...

01:02:39.710 --> 01:02:43.589
... all these massive changes in organisms,

01:02:43.624 --> 01:02:46.765
but we need time.

01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:49.720
Everything seemed to return to the question of time.

01:02:49.755 --> 01:02:52.640
I remembered that Andrew said Charles Darwin ...

01:02:52.675 --> 01:02:54.940
... he accepted the millions of years first,

01:02:54.975 --> 01:02:58.443
and then he adjusted his theory of evolution that assumption.

01:02:58.478 --> 01:03:01.774
But why time is such an important element for evolution?

01:03:10.824 --> 01:03:12.576
Rob Carter is a marine biologist ...

01:03:12.611 --> 01:03:14.292
... so he took me to dive ...

01:03:14.327 --> 01:03:17.749
... to give a glimpse into a world that most people do not see.

01:03:17.784 --> 01:03:19.673
His specialty is the coral ...

01:03:19.708 --> 01:03:22.170
... and he knew a lot about the amazing creatures ...

01:03:22.205 --> 01:03:25.757
... that inhabit the reefs around St. Thomas.

01:03:25.792 --> 01:03:28.509
Oh man, we have sharks here.

01:03:28.544 --> 01:03:29.766
Look how they move ...

01:03:29.801 --> 01:03:33.765
... and it's almost as effortless glide.

01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:35.314
I wish I could swim well.

01:03:35.349 --> 01:03:37.774
Engineers wanted we could do boats like that.

01:03:37.809 --> 01:03:39.812
Submarines they could move as efficiently as a shark,

01:03:39.847 --> 01:03:42.487
but simply can not.

01:03:42.522 --> 01:03:44.656
So from your perspective as a marine biologist,

01:03:44.691 --> 01:03:49.155
and I know you've studied a lot about the area of ​​genetics,

01:03:49.190 --> 01:03:51.949
when people talk about evolution, what is it?

01:03:51.984 --> 01:03:53.790
How do you define evolution?

01:03:53.825 --> 01:03:56.161
The word means change over time ...

01:03:56.196 --> 01:03:58.498
... but I believe in change over time,

01:03:58.533 --> 01:04:00.329
but I'm not an evolutionist.

01:04:00.364 --> 01:04:02.090
So how do we solve it?

01:04:02.125 --> 01:04:04.760
In fact, evolution is a belief ...

01:04:04.795 --> 01:04:07.298
... that enough changes over time,

01:04:07.333 --> 01:04:09.264
through sufficient time,

01:04:09.299 --> 01:04:11.844
They can lead to the common ancestor of all species on Earth.

01:04:11.879 --> 01:04:13.363
So that's the part that rejection.

01:04:13.398 --> 01:04:14.852
Of course species change.

01:04:14.887 --> 01:04:16.271
I mean, look at these sharks here.

01:04:16.306 --> 01:04:18.482
We have different species of sharks.

01:04:18.517 --> 01:04:21.479
When God created, he put into these bodies ...

01:04:21.514 --> 01:04:24.666
... the ability to change, adapt,

01:04:24.701 --> 01:04:27.819
to respond dynamically to the environment.

01:04:27.854 --> 01:04:29.951
But they are still sharks.

01:04:29.986 --> 01:04:32.989
And when we look at the fossil record, they are still sharks.

01:04:33.024 --> 01:04:35.509
People have heard the phrase the "missing link"

01:04:35.544 --> 01:04:37.995
and usually they think of the link between man and monkey.

01:04:38.030 --> 01:04:39.044
No, no missing links ...

01:04:39.079 --> 01:04:40.879
... among almost all major groups of animals ...

01:04:40.914 --> 01:04:44.168
... and almost every other major groups of plants and animals ...

01:04:44.203 --> 01:04:47.355
... and bacteria through the entire fossil record,

01:04:47.390 --> 01:04:50.508
It is indicating very strong so that these are ...

01:04:50.543 --> 01:04:52.849
... different creatures actually.

01:04:52.884 --> 01:04:54.554
So we do not see one type or family becoming another species?

01:04:54.589 --> 01:04:55.686
No.

01:04:55.721 --> 01:04:58.522
The theory of evolution requires small,

01:04:58.557 --> 01:05:03.563
random changes can explain everything we see, but can not.

01:05:03.770 --> 01:05:05.195
Because they can not?

01:05:05.230 --> 01:05:07.906
Because life is so complex ...

01:05:07.941 --> 01:05:09.950
... that small changes can not explain it.

01:05:09.985 --> 01:05:12.780
Just like you can not have an operating system of a computer ...

01:05:12.815 --> 01:05:15.613
... and watch it and say, oh right, this was built ...

01:05:15.648 --> 01:05:17.947
... one digit at a time over a long period of time.

01:05:17.982 --> 01:05:20.246
No, it required an intelligent person to sit ...

01:05:20.281 --> 01:05:21.920
... and build it.

01:05:21.955 --> 01:05:25.125
Well, I can guarantee you as someone who was in that world ...

01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:28.296
... that if anyone in the area of ​​computer science ...

01:05:28.331 --> 01:05:30.757
... said that if we change some things random ...

01:05:30.792 --> 01:05:32.797
... on this operating system will improve.

01:05:32.832 --> 01:05:34.766
I mean, nobody would agree with that.

01:05:34.801 --> 01:05:39.599
No, we will not get a shark evolve into a bird.

01:05:39.634 --> 01:05:43.025
The number of changes and exchange rates ...

01:05:43.060 --> 01:05:47.523
... they are not something you can make one change at a time.

01:05:51.026 --> 01:05:53.780
This is a sea urchin.

01:05:53.815 --> 01:05:54.661
Luce thorny.

01:05:54.696 --> 01:05:56.135
It is pointed. You must be careful.

01:05:56.170 --> 01:05:57.575
Will I stay stuck when you touch it?

01:05:57.610 --> 01:05:59.052
No, it is pointed but ...

01:05:59.087 --> 01:06:00.495
OMG! They are moving.

01:06:00.530 --> 01:06:02.294
Yes, they are moving.

01:06:02.329 --> 01:06:05.166
And among thorns are small tube feet,

01:06:05.201 --> 01:06:08.169
especially in the bottom.

01:06:08.204 --> 01:06:10.552
Look at that move.

01:06:10.587 --> 01:06:14.175
So he walks with their spines with these little tube feet here,

01:06:14.210 --> 01:06:16.308
and that's what you use to attach to things.

01:06:16.343 --> 01:06:19.763
But looking carefully there is one, two, three, four, five,

01:06:19.798 --> 01:06:23.184
six, seven, in fact there are ten radials in this animal.

01:06:24.351 --> 01:06:26.145
In fact, the starfish is his cousin.

01:06:26.180 --> 01:06:27.939
Is seriously? You can not be serious.

01:06:27.974 --> 01:06:29.321
Absolutely.

01:06:29.356 --> 01:06:32.949
Starfish is an echinoderm ...

01:06:32.984 --> 01:06:36.114
... but note that has a pentaradial symmetry instead of 10 parts.

01:06:36.149 --> 01:06:37.990
This starfish.

01:06:38.031 --> 01:06:41.369
At the bottom, look, we see the thorns.

01:06:41.410 --> 01:06:43.079
We see the tube feet.

01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:45.707
His mouth in the middle here.

01:06:45.747 --> 01:06:47.542
So there are similarities here?

01:06:47.582 --> 01:06:49.210
... though outwardly they look totally different.

01:06:49.251 --> 01:06:50.128
Very different.

01:06:50.168 --> 01:06:51.337
You want to see something that looks very different ...

01:06:51.378 --> 01:06:52.463
Clear.

01:06:52.504 --> 01:06:54.966
... which it is also cousin of the starfish and sea urchins?

01:06:55.007 --> 01:06:56.848
It's okay.

01:06:56.883 --> 01:06:58.343
Almost it looks like a rock.

01:06:58.378 --> 01:07:00.008
Yes, yes, I must be careful.

01:07:00.043 --> 01:07:02.384
He is dripping above.

01:07:02.419 --> 01:07:04.726
This is a sea cucumber.

01:07:04.761 --> 01:07:06.650
He has thorns.

01:07:06.685 --> 01:07:11.113
He has tube feet.

01:07:11.148 --> 01:07:14.485
You'd never know until you study enough ...

01:07:14.520 --> 01:07:17.327
... this is also an echinoderm.

01:07:17.362 --> 01:07:18.531
Not very happy to be out of water ...

01:07:18.566 --> 01:07:19.955
... so let me put it back.

01:07:19.990 --> 01:07:21.492
So they are all related but look ...

01:07:21.527 --> 01:07:23.250
... very, very different.

01:07:23.285 --> 01:07:25.141
Related creation.

01:07:25.176 --> 01:07:26.962
Not in an evolutionary sense,

01:07:26.997 --> 01:07:32.003
but our Creator took the edge of living beings, echinoderms,

01:07:32.669 --> 01:07:36.763
and he created this and this and this in a similar pattern.

01:07:36.798 --> 01:07:39.510
And that's what we see throughout the realm of living things,

01:07:39.545 --> 01:07:41.476
similarities and differences.

01:07:41.511 --> 01:07:43.979
So what makes them different?

01:07:44.014 --> 01:07:48.227
Well, genetically they share most of their genes,

01:07:48.262 --> 01:07:51.230
but their developmental genes,

01:07:51.265 --> 01:07:52.779
called Hox genes,

01:07:52.814 --> 01:07:55.818
which establish these patterns in animals as it develops.

01:07:55.853 --> 01:07:58.213
They develop from a single cell.

01:07:58.248 --> 01:08:00.349
In one they establish a pentarradial symmetry.

01:08:00.384 --> 01:08:02.981
In another set ten fold symmetry.

01:08:03.016 --> 01:08:05.578
And in another form this long thin animal.

01:08:05.613 --> 01:08:08.456
Control embryo development ...

01:08:08.491 --> 01:08:10.589
... in these amazing ways.

01:08:10.624 --> 01:08:11.798
So what you're saying when we look at this ...

01:08:11.833 --> 01:08:16.839
... from a genetic or molecular perspective, what we find ...

01:08:18.006 --> 01:08:22.511
... It is a really fascinating in this design.

01:08:22.546 --> 01:08:24.019
Absolutely.

01:08:24.054 --> 01:08:27.912
But what we heard in the conventional paradigm,

01:08:27.947 --> 01:08:31.770
conventional history tells us that these random changes ...

01:08:31.805 --> 01:08:34.107
... they have brought all this.

01:08:34.142 --> 01:08:35.447
Insurance.

01:08:35.482 --> 01:08:38.492
Back in the 18,005, when life was simple,

01:08:38.527 --> 01:08:40.029
when they did not know what was going on inside the cell,

01:08:40.064 --> 01:08:41.863
they did not know how complex the genetics,

01:08:41.899 --> 01:08:43.955
You could imagine all sorts of things.

01:08:43.990 --> 01:08:45.666
But now we know what happens in reality ...

01:08:45.701 --> 01:08:48.585
... behind the scenes, the story is much more complicated.

01:08:48.620 --> 01:08:52.667
You see, I like to say that the genome is four-dimensional.

01:08:52.702 --> 01:08:55.461
We have a dimensional chain called DNA.

01:08:55.496 --> 01:08:57.511
And if you want to continue with that,

01:08:57.546 --> 01:08:59.799
you have to write all the letters of DNA,

01:08:59.834 --> 01:09:01.515
all three billion letters,

01:09:01.550 --> 01:09:03.761
and then you have to draw lines or arrows ...

01:09:03.796 --> 01:09:05.018
...from one place to another...

01:09:05.053 --> 01:09:06.353
... because this part off this part,

01:09:06.388 --> 01:09:09.058
this part interferes with this one, this part increases this one.

01:09:09.093 --> 01:09:11.243
It is a huge network of interactions in two dimensions ...

01:09:11.279 --> 01:09:13.395
... and that's how you have a two-dimensional genome.

01:09:13.430 --> 01:09:15.028
Let me pause for a second because it is ...

01:09:15.063 --> 01:09:17.072
... really amazing, think about this ...

01:09:17.107 --> 01:09:20.944
... because I think in terms of a computer program ...

01:09:20.979 --> 01:09:22.651
... which is pretty static.

01:09:22.685 --> 01:09:24.287
The instructions are there.

01:09:24.322 --> 01:09:26.261
But you're talking about a program ...

01:09:26.296 --> 01:09:28.125
... it is being reprogrammed himself.

01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:29.917
It is modifying its own instructions.

01:09:29.953 --> 01:09:33.124
Oh, and wait until you get to the fourth dimension,

01:09:33.158 --> 01:09:34.965
because there is a third dimension before.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.837
The information in this first dimension, the linear chain,

01:09:37.872 --> 01:09:39.886
It must be organized so ...

01:09:39.921 --> 01:09:43.634
... that when folded in three dimensions, still works.

01:09:43.669 --> 01:09:44.765
Oh, that's amazing.

01:09:44.801 --> 01:09:46.435
Genes that are used together ...

01:09:46.470 --> 01:09:49.160
... next to each other in three dimensional space.

01:09:49.194 --> 01:09:51.814
Are you saying that once this is bent,

01:09:51.850 --> 01:09:54.645
It is almost like having a new set of instructions?

01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:57.832
Yes, a new level of information that whoever ...

01:09:57.867 --> 01:10:00.949
... he programmed the first level needed to understand ...

01:10:00.984 --> 01:10:03.654
... what would happen to work on the third level.

01:10:03.689 --> 01:10:05.162
You said there is another dimension.

01:10:05.197 --> 01:10:07.700
Oh yes, the fourth dimension is time.

01:10:07.735 --> 01:10:09.249
And how does that work?

01:10:09.284 --> 01:10:12.497
The genome changes shape as time passes.

01:10:12.532 --> 01:10:14.504
Maybe you ate something that was bad for you ...

01:10:14.539 --> 01:10:18.523
... and your liver say, I can get rid of that toxin ...

01:10:18.558 --> 01:10:22.471
Now chromosomes in the liver will change shape,

01:10:22.506 --> 01:10:27.136
to expose a new protein gene, make copies of it,

01:10:27.171 --> 01:10:28.727
and build a new protein that can ...

01:10:28.762 --> 01:10:32.141
... remove this toxin and when no longer needed,

01:10:32.176 --> 01:10:34.191
they change shape and bend again.

01:10:34.226 --> 01:10:39.148
dynamic programming, the three levels change ...

01:10:39.183 --> 01:10:41.782
... on the fourth level, time.

01:10:41.817 --> 01:10:44.716
Rob, that goes far beyond anything we know ...

01:10:44.751 --> 01:10:47.615
... even in our most complex software systems ...

01:10:47.650 --> 01:10:50.118
... that almost goes beyond our imagination,

01:10:50.153 --> 01:10:53.168
think that someone could look at that ...

01:10:53.203 --> 01:10:55.206
... and say that everything happened by chance.

01:10:55.241 --> 01:10:56.958
Yes, and that gives glory to God.

01:10:56.993 --> 01:10:57.923
So is.

01:10:57.958 --> 01:11:00.801
You can not build something like that one thing at a time.

01:11:00.836 --> 01:11:04.340
You need to work in all its intertwined complexity ...

01:11:04.375 --> 01:11:05.806
... in four dimensions.

01:11:05.841 --> 01:11:06.890
It's not something you can do ...

01:11:06.925 --> 01:11:10.263
... one letter at a time by natural selection.

01:11:10.298 --> 01:11:11.395
I should have been there.

01:11:11.430 --> 01:11:12.890
Yes, in the same way we talk about ...

01:11:12.925 --> 01:11:14.767
... the atmosphere here at the coral reef.

01:11:14.802 --> 01:11:16.515
If you do not have all these pieces ...

01:11:16.550 --> 01:11:18.229
... the interlocking puzzle,

01:11:18.264 --> 01:11:20.404
you do not have this ecology.

01:11:20.439 --> 01:11:23.031
The system would fall apart if you simply remove ...

01:11:23.066 --> 01:11:25.403
... a couple of very important factors that is there.

01:11:25.438 --> 01:11:28.328
They have to be together or not happen.

01:11:28.363 --> 01:11:31.331
So not only do we have this interdependence,

01:11:31.366 --> 01:11:34.536
This mutualism, so to speak, at the genetic level,

01:11:34.571 --> 01:11:37.671
but we do even more complex saying ...

01:11:37.706 --> 01:11:40.585
... that same mutuality exists on a higher level as well.

01:11:40.620 --> 01:11:41.508
Yes.

01:11:41.543 --> 01:11:44.511
In fact, the whole world has mutualism.

01:11:44.546 --> 01:11:48.217
It is impossible to think that all this could have happened ...

01:11:48.252 --> 01:11:50.654
... only by a series of slow processes ...

01:11:50.689 --> 01:11:53.019
... over thousands of millions of years.

01:11:53.054 --> 01:11:55.350
That's exactly what I'm saying.

01:11:57.768 --> 01:11:59.901
It is clear that the world in which we live is ...

01:11:59.936 --> 01:12:04.609
... incredibly interdependent, from the smallest biological system ...

01:12:04.644 --> 01:12:07.034
... to the largest ecosystem.

01:12:07.069 --> 01:12:10.454
There are complex relationships and mutual everywhere.

01:12:10.489 --> 01:12:14.285
I realized that the six-day creation makes more sense ...

01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:16.376
... from an engineering perspective.

01:12:16.411 --> 01:12:19.999
You need everything to work together while ...

01:12:20.034 --> 01:12:22.466
... so that everything works properly.

01:12:22.501 --> 01:12:26.923
And that's exactly as Genesis says that God created it.

01:12:26.958 --> 01:12:29.139
Rob also said that God created animals ...

01:12:29.174 --> 01:12:33.346
... with the ability to change and adapt to their environment.

01:12:33.381 --> 01:12:36.182
Could it be that this ability to change ...

01:12:36.217 --> 01:12:38.726
... you have been confused with evolution?

01:12:45.982 --> 01:12:47.860
While Todd Wood and I were walking through the zoo,

01:12:47.895 --> 01:12:50.488
we saw incredible beauty and amazing design ...

01:12:50.523 --> 01:12:52.204
... wherever we looked.

01:12:52.239 --> 01:12:54.701
I realized the great diversity among some animals ...

01:12:54.736 --> 01:12:59.205
... like the amazing similarity of others.

01:12:59.240 --> 01:13:01.787
As a biologist, what do you see ...

01:13:01.822 --> 01:13:04.335
... when you look at all these creatures?

01:13:04.370 --> 01:13:06.176
Yes, when I see this,

01:13:06.211 --> 01:13:10.347
these lions specifically, I see cats.

01:13:10.382 --> 01:13:12.844
And all the other cats have here at the zoo,

01:13:12.879 --> 01:13:17.140
all have a fundamental felinity in them ...

01:13:17.175 --> 01:13:19.189
... it is really apparent.

01:13:19.224 --> 01:13:23.443
It is really apparent when you start playing, right?

01:13:23.478 --> 01:13:26.816
You see them playing with some sort of ball or anything and they are ...

01:13:26.851 --> 01:13:28.043
Just like a cat.

01:13:28.078 --> 01:13:29.199
They look like a cat.

01:13:29.234 --> 01:13:32.280
Scientists classify this in a family called Felidae.

01:13:32.315 --> 01:13:34.079
And I understand that felines are ...

01:13:34.114 --> 01:13:36.346
... representatives of a single type / family created.

01:13:36.381 --> 01:13:38.542
So continuity, there is similarity ...

01:13:38.577 --> 01:13:42.123
... so significant that I would say that all these animals have fallen ...

01:13:42.158 --> 01:13:46.085
... a single pair of creatures that were in the ark ...

01:13:46.120 --> 01:13:48.969
... and eventually generated ...

01:13:49.004 --> 01:13:51.758
... all different kinds of cats that we have today.

01:13:51.793 --> 01:13:55.529
So instead of a random accident,

01:13:55.564 --> 01:13:59.265
it seems that all these species are ...

01:13:59.300 --> 01:14:01.934
... a really elaborate design.

01:14:01.969 --> 01:14:03.233
Oh, absolutely.

01:14:03.268 --> 01:14:05.271
And it's not just a design like God intended ...

01:14:05.306 --> 01:14:06.570
... and he created the lion.

01:14:06.605 --> 01:14:09.656
It is that God created something that could make a lion.

01:14:09.691 --> 01:14:12.362
So it's more like a multi-purpose tool or a Swiss Army knife where ...

01:14:12.397 --> 01:14:14.631
... you have all these pieces you can get ...

01:14:14.666 --> 01:14:16.830
... when you need it, but it's one thing.

01:14:16.865 --> 01:14:20.370
Give me some other examples of types / families created.

01:14:20.405 --> 01:14:23.628
Yes, then you have to grizzly and polar bear.

01:14:23.663 --> 01:14:25.375
They are all members of the / family of bears.

01:14:25.410 --> 01:14:28.008
You have ducks, swans and geese.

01:14:28.043 --> 01:14:30.213
Thing with the type of dogs is really very interesting.

01:14:30.248 --> 01:14:33.013
All this creature that looks like a wolf ...

01:14:33.048 --> 01:14:35.760
... and we can bring in a few hundred years ...

01:14:35.795 --> 01:14:37.726
... many different races.

01:14:37.761 --> 01:14:39.909
Well, Todd, that's something fascinating,

01:14:39.944 --> 01:14:42.794
think about what God was doing ...

01:14:42.829 --> 01:14:45.645
... when He brought two of each type / family.

01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:47.146
What do you think was going on there?

01:14:47.181 --> 01:14:48.236
Oh yeah.

01:14:48.271 --> 01:14:52.652
He did not have to bring every little variety in the ark.

01:14:52.687 --> 01:14:54.660
So when you do the math ...

01:14:54.695 --> 01:14:56.114
... and, okay, we do not know exactly how many ...

01:14:56.149 --> 01:14:57.913
... species created in the ark ...

01:14:57.948 --> 01:15:00.200
... but maybe a few thousand, and are small.

01:15:00.235 --> 01:15:02.417
Most animals are quite small.

01:15:02.452 --> 01:15:05.665
So you have plenty of room, plenty of room literally.

01:15:05.700 --> 01:15:08.131
And all the diversity we have now ...

01:15:08.166 --> 01:15:11.254
... It is within these two of each type / family.

01:15:13.922 --> 01:15:15.764
Well Todd, we're looking at the zebras ...

01:15:15.799 --> 01:15:19.470
... and all are unique and yet all these creatures,

01:15:19.505 --> 01:15:22.052
... there is so much complexity and diversity.

01:15:22.087 --> 01:15:24.600
How do you explain the standard story,

01:15:24.635 --> 01:15:27.442
the conventional paradigm?

01:15:27.477 --> 01:15:30.814
Well, they would use evolution, right?

01:15:30.849 --> 01:15:34.116
Millions of years, random variations,

01:15:34.151 --> 01:15:39.115
all things that are alive today, the cactus, the zebra ...

01:15:39.656 --> 01:15:41.888
... the grass is here, everything is related.

01:15:41.923 --> 01:15:44.120
We all come from a common ancestor who lived ...

01:15:44.155 --> 01:15:46.128
... thousands of millions of years ago ...

01:15:46.163 --> 01:15:50.418
... and through the process of mutation and genetic variation ...

01:15:50.453 --> 01:15:53.129
... and natural selection, hence we get ...

01:15:53.164 --> 01:15:55.137
... all we have today.

01:15:55.172 --> 01:15:59.218
Natural selection ... What's that?

01:15:59.259 --> 01:16:01.637
Does the kind of creative potential ...

01:16:01.678 --> 01:16:04.306
... we need to get all this?

01:16:04.341 --> 01:16:06.934
Natural selection is basically ...

01:16:06.975 --> 01:16:09.520
... to kill things that are not suitable for the environment.

01:16:09.561 --> 01:16:12.398
So if you're a finch in the Galapagos ...

01:16:12.439 --> 01:16:14.859
... and you have a really small peak ...

01:16:14.900 --> 01:16:17.465
... and the only food you have available are ...

01:16:17.500 --> 01:16:20.031
... really large, hard seeds, you will die.

01:16:20.066 --> 01:16:21.705
And that's exactly what we observe.

01:16:21.740 --> 01:16:23.576
So we can see how they change the sizes of finch peaks ...

01:16:23.611 --> 01:16:27.330
... throughout the generations in the Galapagos.

01:16:27.365 --> 01:16:28.831
But they're still finches.

01:16:28.866 --> 01:16:30.797
Birds remain.

01:16:30.832 --> 01:16:33.710
The notion that natural selection can generate ...

01:16:33.745 --> 01:16:36.522
... all the diversity we see, has not been demonstrated.

01:16:36.557 --> 01:16:39.264
What we usually see with natural selection it is ...

01:16:39.299 --> 01:16:42.095
... that natural selection makes many subtle tunings.

01:16:42.130 --> 01:16:44.394
Here we have these oryx,

01:16:44.429 --> 01:16:48.315
beautiful creatures and very, very pale colors.

01:16:48.350 --> 01:16:51.521
Extension wild oryx is right in the southern end ...

01:16:51.556 --> 01:16:53.403
... Sahara Desert.

01:16:53.438 --> 01:16:56.859
So you can see that their coloration makes sense.

01:16:56.894 --> 01:16:58.158
If you were one of a very dark color ...

01:16:58.193 --> 01:17:01.405
... would be very easy for predators found him,

01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:04.617
so they end up being of these beautiful and light colors.

01:17:04.652 --> 01:17:07.292
And that's an example of where the selection ...

01:17:07.327 --> 01:17:11.290
... take a change and become adaptation.

01:17:11.325 --> 01:17:14.257
And that brings us back to the notion ...

01:17:14.292 --> 01:17:16.796
... of that design truly exquisite in the beginning ...

01:17:16.831 --> 01:17:18.595
Oh, I think so. Absolutely.

01:17:18.630 --> 01:17:21.551
It has provided these creatures the ability ...

01:17:21.586 --> 01:17:25.054
... to survive and change to their advantage.

01:17:25.089 --> 01:17:26.186
Absolutely.

01:17:26.221 --> 01:17:28.703
So the ability to change your color ...

01:17:28.738 --> 01:17:31.630
... this way, to fit into an environment,

01:17:31.665 --> 01:17:34.522
That must be integrated into the system before you start.

01:17:34.557 --> 01:17:35.696
Now, do not get me wrong,

01:17:35.731 --> 01:17:37.817
natural selection and random variation ...

01:17:37.852 --> 01:17:39.157
... They can do amazing things.

01:17:39.192 --> 01:17:44.198
The changes we see are very surprising.

01:17:44.281 --> 01:17:47.124
But we see a type changing to another type.

01:17:47.159 --> 01:17:50.872
All we see are the changes that happened within a created kind.

01:17:50.907 --> 01:17:53.499
So we have a tree félidos with all cats in it.

01:17:53.534 --> 01:17:56.061
Canids tree with all the dogs on him.

01:17:56.096 --> 01:17:58.552
There is a tree ursids with all the bears in it.

01:17:58.587 --> 01:18:00.721
It is the tree of equines with all horses in it.

01:18:00.756 --> 01:18:05.094
Each individual type created has its own individual tree,

01:18:05.129 --> 01:18:07.927
So you end up with something like an orchard or forest.

01:18:07.962 --> 01:18:10.689
As a scientist, I think what you're saying is ...

01:18:10.724 --> 01:18:14.937
... that the paradigm of Genesis responsive to all this data.

01:18:14.972 --> 01:18:17.607
Ultimately I think it does because it embraces ...

01:18:17.642 --> 01:18:19.698
... both similarity and difference.

01:18:19.733 --> 01:18:23.112
Now, as I said, there are many questions ...

01:18:23.147 --> 01:18:24.911
... they are still there ...

01:18:24.946 --> 01:18:29.744
... but I'm pretty sure, because what our paradigm can explain,

01:18:29.779 --> 01:18:33.915
I am quite sure that these answers will be found.

01:18:33.950 --> 01:18:35.416
After we left the zebras,

01:18:35.451 --> 01:18:37.591
we headed gorillas.

01:18:37.626 --> 01:18:42.012
Todd wanted to talk about the question of human evolution.

01:18:42.047 --> 01:18:45.551
Todd, we see it all the time, a new discovery, new skulls,

01:18:45.586 --> 01:18:50.556
new skeletons that supposedly solidify around here.

01:18:51.723 --> 01:18:53.357
What you see there?

01:18:53.392 --> 01:18:57.105
Yeah, well, I have some here in my backpack.

01:18:57.140 --> 01:18:58.403
Oh, a skull.

01:18:58.438 --> 01:19:03.444
So this is a Neandertal.

01:19:03.694 --> 01:19:08.449
A very low forehead, and we have very high foreheads.

01:19:08.484 --> 01:19:11.744
The face, the middle of the face, is out ...

01:19:11.779 --> 01:19:16.082
... but at the same time, well, he looks very human.

01:19:16.117 --> 01:19:17.017
So that's the Neandertal.

01:19:17.052 --> 01:19:17.917
Would you help me hold it?

01:19:17.952 --> 01:19:19.216
Yes.

01:19:19.251 --> 01:19:22.921
We have others who are very different.

01:19:22.956 --> 01:19:26.556
This is Australopithecus africanus.

01:19:26.591 --> 01:19:29.637
You can see that really has nothing against.

01:19:29.672 --> 01:19:30.978
It is completely leans back.

01:19:31.013 --> 01:19:36.019
A cranial capacity very, very, low, snout protrudes much ...

01:19:36.054 --> 01:19:39.939
... so the face is tilted forward.

01:19:39.974 --> 01:19:41.655
What are you doing with this?

01:19:41.690 --> 01:19:44.401
I mean, there is much more that we could show, many more photographs,

01:19:44.436 --> 01:19:47.113
many skulls over and saw them all together you realize that ...

01:19:47.148 --> 01:19:50.616
... there are many differences between them.

01:19:50.651 --> 01:19:52.541
Well, so it goes.

01:19:52.576 --> 01:19:55.252
All kind of created we were talking,

01:19:55.287 --> 01:19:59.923
I can show over and over again with a lot of research ...

01:19:59.958 --> 01:20:04.964
... I can find discontinuity between humans and nonhumans.

01:20:05.672 --> 01:20:07.973
So this falls on the human side.

01:20:08.008 --> 01:20:11.846
This Neandertal here is one of us.

01:20:11.881 --> 01:20:13.448
This is not it.

01:20:13.483 --> 01:20:14.980
Is different.

01:20:15.015 --> 01:20:19.019
But this would be just one more of those varieties among living things ...

01:20:19.054 --> 01:20:23.024
... that God created in the beginning and that survived the flood in the ark.

01:20:23.059 --> 01:20:26.736
So when we see the Neanderthals,

01:20:26.771 --> 01:20:29.494
we are seeing a human,

01:20:29.529 --> 01:20:33.576
but it is a human that as we see in dogs,

01:20:33.611 --> 01:20:35.959
There are many varieties of dogs ...

01:20:35.994 --> 01:20:38.373
We have many varieties of people.

01:20:38.408 --> 01:20:39.880
So even looking at the gorilla,

01:20:39.915 --> 01:20:43.252
we can see the obvious differences between him and us,

01:20:43.287 --> 01:20:45.334
and one of no small importance is that he is there ...

01:20:45.369 --> 01:20:47.382
... and we can go home when we finish.

01:20:47.417 --> 01:20:50.385
So these differences are very big, right?

01:20:50.420 --> 01:20:52.726
Yes absolutely.

01:20:52.761 --> 01:20:56.647
The image of God implies the idea of ​​being ...

01:20:56.682 --> 01:20:58.935
... God's representatives on Earth.

01:20:58.970 --> 01:21:01.938
Part of this is to have dominion and authority,

01:21:01.973 --> 01:21:03.403
a spiritual quality that we ...

01:21:03.438 --> 01:21:06.776
... and we do not share with animals like this.

01:21:08.527 --> 01:21:11.114
It is obvious that we are different from the rest of creation ...

01:21:11.149 --> 01:21:13.372
... because we were made in God's image.

01:21:13.407 --> 01:21:15.040
We are the only ones who have created zoos ...

01:21:15.075 --> 01:21:17.870
... to contemplate the beauty of God's animals.

01:21:17.905 --> 01:21:20.265
And we are unique in record time ...

01:21:20.300 --> 01:21:22.589
... and want to know our own history.

01:21:22.624 --> 01:21:27.547
But where does our concept of time?

01:21:38.390 --> 01:21:40.190
It was a beautiful night.

01:21:40.225 --> 01:21:41.984
Danny took me away, out of town,

01:21:42.019 --> 01:21:44.188
and I stayed up late to show ...

01:21:44.223 --> 01:21:46.858
... something I will never forget.

01:21:48.859 --> 01:21:52.488
Oh wow, so now you do buy a telescope.

01:21:54.239 --> 01:21:57.118
You know, we have some purposes that were given to the stars.

01:21:57.153 --> 01:22:00.201
In Genesis 1: 14-19, the fourth day of creation,

01:22:00.236 --> 01:22:03.249
mentions that the stars and other bodies ...

01:22:03.284 --> 01:22:04.214
... celestial mark time,

01:22:04.249 --> 01:22:08.129
reign over night, to be a sign, seasons, festivals and others.

01:22:08.164 --> 01:22:12.925
People have used the stars to mark the passage of time.

01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:14.719
every night patterns are repeated.

01:22:14.754 --> 01:22:16.551
They are repeated every year.

01:22:16.586 --> 01:22:18.801
They returned in their season.

01:22:18.836 --> 01:22:20.981
There is very regular here.

01:22:21.016 --> 01:22:23.567
What about the design of the sun and moon?

01:22:23.602 --> 01:22:25.068
There are a couple of things I can say about it.

01:22:25.103 --> 01:22:28.649
On rare occasions, the moon passes between us and the sun.

01:22:28.684 --> 01:22:30.985
It does not happen very often, and when it happens ...

01:22:31.020 --> 01:22:33.702
... the moon barely covers the sun.

01:22:33.737 --> 01:22:36.052
If the moon were a little smaller ...

01:22:36.087 --> 01:22:38.332
... or a bit further, it would fail to do so.

01:22:38.367 --> 01:22:40.453
If larger or were closer to us,

01:22:40.488 --> 01:22:42.627
cover it completely.

01:22:42.662 --> 01:22:46.626
So these eclipses are spectacular and unusual,

01:22:46.661 --> 01:22:49.504
and this is the only planet that matter,

01:22:49.539 --> 01:22:51.637
and is the only planet that happens.

01:22:51.672 --> 01:22:54.842
And you have to think and that's the way the world works ...

01:22:54.877 --> 01:22:56.642
... for no apparent reason ...

01:22:56.677 --> 01:22:59.889
... or that the world is so for a purpose and design.

01:22:59.924 --> 01:23:02.522
For me, this speaks of creation.

01:23:02.557 --> 01:23:03.685
Okay, here on our heads,

01:23:03.720 --> 01:23:05.520
we have the great square of Pegasus.

01:23:05.555 --> 01:23:06.985
It is this big box.

01:23:07.020 --> 01:23:10.483
Leaving Pegaso is a blurred spot along there.

01:23:10.518 --> 01:23:11.531
You see?

01:23:11.566 --> 01:23:13.367
That's the Andromeda galaxy.

01:23:13.402 --> 01:23:16.906
It is the most distant object you can see with the naked eye.

01:23:16.941 --> 01:23:18.038
It's a bit beyond, we think it is,

01:23:18.073 --> 01:23:20.367
a little more than two million light years away ...

01:23:20.402 --> 01:23:22.662
... and it contains a couple hundred thousand million stars.

01:23:22.697 --> 01:23:25.286
Danny Okay, that brings me to a big question ...

01:23:25.321 --> 01:23:27.875
... a big question in the minds of many people.

01:23:27.910 --> 01:23:30.878
If we have stars that are so far away,

01:23:30.913 --> 01:23:32.844
million light years away,

01:23:32.879 --> 01:23:37.349
and if the Earth is as young as we ...

01:23:37.384 --> 01:23:40.596
... then how can the starlight can be here?

01:23:40.631 --> 01:23:41.561
Yes.

01:23:41.596 --> 01:23:44.517
We call this the problem of travel time of light ...

01:23:44.552 --> 01:23:47.150
... and I will try to raise it in a slightly different way.

01:23:47.185 --> 01:23:50.690
We believe that creation has only thousands of years old,

01:23:50.725 --> 01:23:54.360
say 6,000 or 7,000 years something.

01:23:54.395 --> 01:23:56.118
And I just get noticed something ...

01:23:56.153 --> 01:23:58.489
... we think it is 2 million years away.

01:23:58.524 --> 01:24:00.789
I think those distances are reasonably accurate ...

01:24:00.824 --> 01:24:03.119
... and creationists need to answer this question ...

01:24:03.154 --> 01:24:07.040
... and we have offered several different solutions to it.

01:24:07.075 --> 01:24:10.924
I will discuss with you my solution to this.

01:24:10.959 --> 01:24:13.379
Several things catch my eye in the narrative of creation.

01:24:13.414 --> 01:24:15.887
One, many processes were happening,

01:24:15.922 --> 01:24:18.801
very fast processes, but still processes.

01:24:18.836 --> 01:24:20.100
If you look at the third day of narrative,

01:24:20.135 --> 01:24:22.561
talks about Earth sprouting plants.

01:24:22.596 --> 01:24:26.267
He says that the earth produces these plants and the Earth produced.

01:24:26.302 --> 01:24:27.774
I think if you had been there,

01:24:27.809 --> 01:24:29.853
It would have looked like a film in fast motion.

01:24:29.888 --> 01:24:31.862
Growth that would normally take decades,

01:24:31.897 --> 01:24:35.777
taking place in a matter of minutes and hours at most.

01:24:35.812 --> 01:24:39.786
normal growth of abnormally fast.

01:24:39.821 --> 01:24:42.075
I think you can play on day one of creation ...

01:24:42.110 --> 01:24:43.373
... in terms of another day.

01:24:43.408 --> 01:24:44.952
So I turn to the story of the fourth day.

01:24:44.987 --> 01:24:46.251
There is not much information is given ...

01:24:46.286 --> 01:24:49.290
... but I believe God made the stars also quickly ...

01:24:49.325 --> 01:24:51.872
... and other astronomical bodies and then to ...

01:24:51.907 --> 01:24:54.420
... they could fulfill their role of being seen,

01:24:54.455 --> 01:24:56.887
He quickly had to bring that light.

01:24:56.922 --> 01:24:59.467
Just as He brought plants and matured quickly,

01:24:59.502 --> 01:25:01.475
He had to bring light here.

01:25:01.510 --> 01:25:03.769
I am suggesting that these objects really look ...

01:25:03.804 --> 01:25:06.516
... as the Andromeda galaxy we saw a few minutes ago,

01:25:06.551 --> 01:25:10.478
We are looking at the light that actually came out of that object.

01:25:10.513 --> 01:25:13.189
So I think that rapid maturation took place.

01:25:13.224 --> 01:25:16.109
Danny, are there any other things you see ...

01:25:16.149 --> 01:25:19.654
... you indicate a young universe?

01:25:19.689 --> 01:25:21.280
I think so.

01:25:21.321 --> 01:25:24.283
For example, spiral galaxies, Andromeda Galaxy which ...

01:25:24.324 --> 01:25:26.244
... we talked about, is a spiral galaxy.

01:25:26.284 --> 01:25:27.662
Ours is too.

01:25:27.703 --> 01:25:30.498
And inside galaxies should rotate faster ...

01:25:30.539 --> 01:25:31.964
... that the outside of the galaxy.

01:25:31.999 --> 01:25:35.128
So after a few rotations finish ...

01:25:35.163 --> 01:25:37.135
... undoing those spiral patterns.

01:25:37.170 --> 01:25:39.507
They must disappear after a few rotations.

01:25:39.548 --> 01:25:41.342
Now, most astronomers think that spiral galaxies have ...

01:25:41.377 --> 01:25:42.933
... 10 billion years old,

01:25:42.968 --> 01:25:45.346
So why do we see spiral patterns yet?

01:25:45.381 --> 01:25:46.728
we should not see them,

01:25:46.763 --> 01:25:48.689
and it has long recognized this problem.

01:25:48.724 --> 01:25:52.353
But if we see the outer planets of the solar system,

01:25:52.388 --> 01:25:54.810
gas giants, all have rings.

01:25:54.845 --> 01:25:57.233
And we also know that they are changing.

01:25:57.268 --> 01:25:58.532
It's extinguish.

01:25:58.567 --> 01:26:01.779
They have documented changes that have happened within the ring system.

01:26:01.814 --> 01:26:03.840
You have all these gravitational pulls ...

01:26:03.875 --> 01:26:05.831
... other orbiting satellites.

01:26:05.866 --> 01:26:08.244
So these ring systems are quite young.

01:26:08.279 --> 01:26:10.127
This does not prove that the solar system is young ...

01:26:10.162 --> 01:26:12.248
... but it proves that the ring systems are young ...

01:26:12.283 --> 01:26:13.714
... and that's interesting.

01:26:13.749 --> 01:26:15.960
Well, you mentioned many theories ...

01:26:15.995 --> 01:26:18.427
... on spirals and others,

01:26:18.462 --> 01:26:21.638
And that brings us to what most people see ...

01:26:21.673 --> 01:26:26.679
... as the great theory of cosmology and the universe, the Big Bang.

01:26:27.220 --> 01:26:28.854
How do you see this?

01:26:28.889 --> 01:26:30.975
Are you survive the passage of time?

01:26:31.010 --> 01:26:31.857
I do not think so.

01:26:31.892 --> 01:26:35.396
I think he's having a lot of problems to the point that ...

01:26:35.431 --> 01:26:37.112
... more than twelve years ago ...

01:26:37.147 --> 01:26:39.233
... I think it was in New Scientist Magazine that there was ...

01:26:39.268 --> 01:26:41.319
... an open letter protesting the Big Bang theory ...

01:26:41.354 --> 01:26:43.577
... and since then has hundreds of signatures.

01:26:43.612 --> 01:26:45.323
And most people who signed were atheistic,

01:26:45.358 --> 01:26:47.039
they are not even creationists.

01:26:47.074 --> 01:26:48.867
So this idea that the Big Bang model ...

01:26:48.902 --> 01:26:51.366
... is universally accepted is not true.

01:26:51.401 --> 01:26:53.831
There are many people out there, acquaintances,

01:26:53.866 --> 01:26:56.131
physical and very famous astronomers ...

01:26:56.166 --> 01:26:58.508
... they have real problems with the Big Bang.

01:26:58.543 --> 01:27:01.297
And I find no way you can reconcile ...

01:27:01.332 --> 01:27:02.554
... the Big Bang to the Bible,

01:27:02.589 --> 01:27:04.926
although many people seem to think you can do it.

01:27:04.961 --> 01:27:07.136
I think the temptation is to try to have ...

01:27:07.171 --> 01:27:09.718
... interpret Scripture in terms ...

01:27:09.753 --> 01:27:12.266
... the current cosmological thinking.

01:27:12.301 --> 01:27:13.106
Thats nothing new.

01:27:13.141 --> 01:27:16.228
That has happened before, and has had disastrous results.

01:27:16.263 --> 01:27:19.279
So I think when you see the history of science,

01:27:19.314 --> 01:27:21.406
the way we have discarded theories over time,

01:27:21.441 --> 01:27:25.863
We've had theories that were supposedly beyond any discussion ...

01:27:25.898 --> 01:27:28.246
... and then they were discarded.

01:27:28.281 --> 01:27:31.577
When you see that lesson in history ...

01:27:31.612 --> 01:27:33.251
... and then you want to join Genesis,

01:27:33.286 --> 01:27:36.249
you want to interpret Genesis in terms of the most popular paradigm,

01:27:36.284 --> 01:27:39.841
I think you should be very careful.

01:27:39.876 --> 01:27:44.382
I realized that Danny was refocusing our perspective.

01:27:44.417 --> 01:27:45.931
We need to interpret the Universe ...

01:27:45.966 --> 01:27:49.768
... in terms of Genesis, not the reverse.

01:27:49.803 --> 01:27:54.392
And Genesis tells us that God created the sun, moon, and stars ...

01:27:54.427 --> 01:27:58.330
... to be a magnificent clock that records the passage of time.

01:27:58.365 --> 01:28:02.233
Even the ancient towers built to follow the stars.

01:28:02.268 --> 01:28:04.527
But what Genesis tells us about these people ...

01:28:04.562 --> 01:28:07.155
... and the languages ​​they spoke?

01:28:16.038 --> 01:28:19.172
Doug took me one of the best archaeological museums ...

01:28:19.207 --> 01:28:22.128
... in the world to show some of the unique artifacts ...

01:28:22.163 --> 01:28:26.221
... that they relate to Genesis.

01:28:26.256 --> 01:28:28.551
Bible events unfold ...

01:28:28.586 --> 01:28:30.183
... in the ancient Near East.

01:28:30.218 --> 01:28:33.785
So all these lands are extremely important ...

01:28:33.820 --> 01:28:36.691
... to understand how and what took place in the biblical text.

01:28:36.726 --> 01:28:39.562
So this continues the events we have been seeing ...

01:28:39.597 --> 01:28:42.571
... Genesis of Creation and the Flood ...

01:28:42.606 --> 01:28:45.401
... and we are now in the dispersion of mankind ...

01:28:45.436 --> 01:28:47.445
... arising from Noah and his family.

01:28:47.480 --> 01:28:48.410
Exactly.

01:28:48.445 --> 01:28:49.745
And the dispersion would have happened ...

01:28:49.780 --> 01:28:53.701
... somewhere in the mountains northwest of Mesopotamia ...

01:28:53.736 --> 01:28:56.335
... and what we see in the narrative of the biblical text ...

01:28:56.370 --> 01:29:01.376
... it is that a number of people have migrated to southern Mesopotamia,

01:29:01.458 --> 01:29:03.133
to the land of Shinar,

01:29:03.168 --> 01:29:07.507
and they set out to urbanize, to live in cities.

01:29:07.542 --> 01:29:08.841
And that's the famous Tower of Babel.

01:29:08.876 --> 01:29:10.015
Absolutely.

01:29:10.050 --> 01:29:11.767
Do we know where is this place?

01:29:11.802 --> 01:29:14.519
There are about seven or eight Babels,

01:29:14.554 --> 01:29:18.810
cities of Babel, in ancient Mesopotamia areas.

01:29:18.845 --> 01:29:21.526
So I studied each of these areas ...

01:29:21.561 --> 01:29:24.482
... and I have found only one that meets all the criteria ...

01:29:24.517 --> 01:29:29.487
... the famous monument of the Tower of Babel and Eridu,

01:29:29.945 --> 01:29:33.205
which is in southeastern Mesopotamia.

01:29:33.240 --> 01:29:37.432
We signals expansion north, south,

01:29:37.467 --> 01:29:41.588
east, west, all the way to Egypt.

01:29:41.623 --> 01:29:44.585
And when you say evidence, does that refers to artifacts ...

01:29:44.620 --> 01:29:47.422
... we found in archaeological excavations?

01:29:47.457 --> 01:29:48.512
Exactly.

01:29:48.547 --> 01:29:53.058
There is a huge amount of material culture ...

01:29:53.093 --> 01:29:57.285
... very specific that attest to this expansion of people ...

01:29:57.320 --> 01:30:01.477
... I'm connecting with the dispersion after Babel.

01:30:01.512 --> 01:30:03.980
Here are the bowls bevelled edges, these two,

01:30:04.015 --> 01:30:06.941
Riemchen brick that we see up there ...

01:30:06.976 --> 01:30:09.950
... and those two jars with nozzle.

01:30:09.985 --> 01:30:14.323
All these diagnostic forms of ceramics and material culture,

01:30:14.358 --> 01:30:16.790
They are found throughout the Middle East.

01:30:16.825 --> 01:30:20.371
The Bible describes an event that is not only the confusion of language ...

01:30:20.406 --> 01:30:23.755
... but the scattering of people away from the city,

01:30:23.790 --> 01:30:28.046
because we see the language or the written language expression ...

01:30:28.081 --> 01:30:32.139
... appear out of nowhere and then different languages ​​...

01:30:32.174 --> 01:30:35.470
... being represented by cuneiform ...

01:30:35.505 --> 01:30:38.603
... or through hieroglyphic writings or other means.

01:30:38.638 --> 01:30:43.644
So you do not have a universal plan that is followed in all languages.

01:30:43.685 --> 01:30:47.023
You can see a great diversity in the form of grammar ...

01:30:47.058 --> 01:30:50.606
... from language to language even among ancient languages.

01:30:50.641 --> 01:30:54.155
It seems then that the event recorded in Genesis ...

01:30:54.190 --> 01:30:55.954
... about the Tower of Babel,

01:30:55.989 --> 01:30:58.868
It is a very, very critical for archeology event.

01:30:58.903 --> 01:31:00.167
It is.

01:31:00.202 --> 01:31:03.706
And all this fits perfectly with what we would ...

01:31:03.741 --> 01:31:07.210
... as the Bible record of how languages ​​emerged.

01:31:07.245 --> 01:31:10.010
It really is the only way to explain this.

01:31:10.045 --> 01:31:14.050
So the integrity of biblical history is justified definitively ...

01:31:14.085 --> 01:31:16.350
... the expression of these languages.

01:31:16.385 --> 01:31:20.682
Currently most of us think of a tower like the kind of thing ...

01:31:20.717 --> 01:31:24.060
... we see in big cities with big walls and straight.

01:31:24.095 --> 01:31:25.651
It is that what they were building?

01:31:25.686 --> 01:31:28.362
Well, essentially it was a variation of the pyramid,

01:31:28.397 --> 01:31:32.818
and he had four sides and several stairs to reach the top.

01:31:32.853 --> 01:31:37.240
In Eridu we have a temple that existed in 18 different stages ...

01:31:37.275 --> 01:31:40.907
... and at each stage it grew in size and complexity.

01:31:40.942 --> 01:31:44.659
And that final temple, the last phase of the temple,

01:31:44.694 --> 01:31:48.376
It was abandoned immediately right at the time ...

01:31:48.411 --> 01:31:50.592
... Late in the expansion of Uruk.

01:31:50.627 --> 01:31:55.633
Corner against the temple was a completely huge platform.

01:31:56.508 --> 01:31:58.052
Do you think these could have been the foundation ...

01:31:58.087 --> 01:31:59.387
... of the Tower of Babel?

01:31:59.422 --> 01:32:00.435
Absolutely.

01:32:00.470 --> 01:32:04.392
And I would suggest that this late Uruk expansion ...

01:32:04.427 --> 01:32:07.145
... which began this technology was something ...

01:32:07.180 --> 01:32:09.027
... that spread to people.

01:32:09.062 --> 01:32:13.693
We find ways of these ziggurats around the world.

01:32:13.728 --> 01:32:15.253
We find them in China.

01:32:15.288 --> 01:32:16.743
We find them in India.

01:32:16.778 --> 01:32:19.323
We are found in various parts of America.

01:32:19.358 --> 01:32:20.914
We find them everywhere.

01:32:20.949 --> 01:32:24.584
Well, obviously here we have evidence of civilization ...

01:32:24.619 --> 01:32:28.082
... and people began to join in communities, including cities.

01:32:28.117 --> 01:32:29.876
Do we have more evidence of that?

01:32:29.911 --> 01:32:30.841
Yes of course.

01:32:30.876 --> 01:32:34.255
We can anticipate the time of Abraham because we know ...

01:32:34.290 --> 01:32:36.513
... that Abraham lived in Ur,

01:32:36.548 --> 01:32:39.405
I was also south of Mesopotamia ...

01:32:39.440 --> 01:32:41.685
... at the end of the third millennium BC.

01:32:41.720 --> 01:32:43.931
That brings us to the end of Genesis chapter 11.

01:32:43.966 --> 01:32:45.397
Exactly.

01:32:45.432 --> 01:32:49.354
In fact, we can see ceramics and some cuneiform tablets ...

01:32:49.389 --> 01:32:52.982
... all dating from the period of the Third Dynasty of Ur.

01:32:53.017 --> 01:32:54.614
It is amazing to think about this ...

01:32:54.649 --> 01:32:58.363
... while we're sitting here, thinking of Abraham ...

01:32:58.398 --> 01:33:00.632
... and this represents the culture ...

01:33:00.667 --> 01:33:02.831
... and civilization in which he lived.

01:33:02.866 --> 01:33:05.787
It is a great link to that record in Genesis.

01:33:05.822 --> 01:33:07.419
It is fascinating and gives you the feeling ...

01:33:07.454 --> 01:33:10.124
... put your hands around the events happening ...

01:33:10.159 --> 01:33:12.758
... in the biblical text.

01:33:12.793 --> 01:33:14.760
When I looked through the history,

01:33:14.795 --> 01:33:17.736
I realized that each of these cultures had been ...

01:33:17.771 --> 01:33:20.641
... impacted by the events recorded in Genesis.

01:33:20.676 --> 01:33:24.263
But what is the importance of Genesis to us today?

01:33:32.396 --> 01:33:33.690
George Grant wanted to meet ...

01:33:33.725 --> 01:33:35.781
... in a garden near his home.

01:33:35.816 --> 01:33:40.154
He said it was a good reminder of where our history began.

01:33:40.189 --> 01:33:42.204
So there is something important ...

01:33:42.239 --> 01:33:45.763
... about the text in Genesis in which Adam and Eve ...

01:33:45.798 --> 01:33:49.288
... were placed in a garden to look after him.

01:33:49.323 --> 01:33:51.349
That's more than a simple story.

01:33:51.384 --> 01:33:53.340
It is much more than a simple story.

01:33:53.375 --> 01:33:57.130
One of the things you see in Genesis chapter 1 is ...

01:33:57.165 --> 01:33:59.930
... the structure for time.

01:33:59.965 --> 01:34:03.990
The universe was created for a 24-hour day.

01:34:04.025 --> 01:34:07.980
So everything from our sleep cycles ...

01:34:08.015 --> 01:34:12.061
... and how our work cycle work, all come from ...

01:34:12.096 --> 01:34:15.102
... the definitive historical record.

01:34:15.137 --> 01:34:18.073
When we come to Genesis chapter 2,

01:34:18.108 --> 01:34:20.742
we begin to see the meaning and purpose of man.

01:34:20.777 --> 01:34:25.742
Of course, in Genesis 3 we see corruption chapter all by the fall.

01:34:26.116 --> 01:34:28.661
And the implications of a historical fall,

01:34:28.696 --> 01:34:31.253
a real man and a real woman,

01:34:31.288 --> 01:34:35.752
really they fell in real sin had ...

01:34:35.792 --> 01:34:39.297
... implications for the rest of the Bible.

01:34:39.332 --> 01:34:42.800
If you remove the literal Adam and Eve,

01:34:42.841 --> 01:34:46.179
That changes the whole shape of what the story is ...

01:34:46.219 --> 01:34:48.555
... and how history is remembered.

01:34:48.590 --> 01:34:52.055
Is that because when we get ...

01:34:52.090 --> 01:34:55.521
... Adam and Eve from the historical record,

01:34:55.562 --> 01:34:58.030
then we can basically invent ...

01:34:58.065 --> 01:34:59.942
... what we think about man, marriage,

01:34:59.977 --> 01:35:02.070
and even sexuality?

01:35:02.105 --> 01:35:04.077
Completely.

01:35:04.112 --> 01:35:06.705
The apóstol Pablo understood the events ...

01:35:06.740 --> 01:35:11.287
... of the first chapters of Genesis as training,

01:35:11.322 --> 01:35:14.046
not only for our understanding of history,

01:35:14.081 --> 01:35:19.087
but also the relations between men and women and their children,

01:35:19.503 --> 01:35:22.262
the character and nature of marriage,

01:35:22.297 --> 01:35:27.303
right and wrong in moral relations, including sexuality.

01:35:27.427 --> 01:35:32.433
All this assumes of those early chapters in Genesis,

01:35:32.724 --> 01:35:36.902
often quoting passages word for word.

01:35:36.937 --> 01:35:41.484
It seems that even Pedro takes that event the Flood ...

01:35:41.519 --> 01:35:44.171
... such as a historic event ...

01:35:44.206 --> 01:35:47.266
... and putting it in the context of which ...

01:35:47.301 --> 01:35:50.290
... it is pointing to a coming judgment.

01:35:50.325 --> 01:35:52.954
So even the trial is a part of understanding ...

01:35:52.989 --> 01:35:54.753
... the historical record.

01:35:54.788 --> 01:35:58.048
You can cut out parts of the story ...

01:35:58.083 --> 01:36:02.260
... and lose sight of the meaning of it all.

01:36:02.295 --> 01:36:05.299
I think most Christians, when we talk about ...

01:36:05.334 --> 01:36:07.766
... for example, the life of Christ,

01:36:07.801 --> 01:36:11.784
these are understood as historical records.

01:36:11.819 --> 01:36:15.649
Why, when we look at the record in Genesis,

01:36:15.684 --> 01:36:18.604
we have a tendency not to want to do that?

01:36:18.639 --> 01:36:21.488
We tend to do so because ...

01:36:21.523 --> 01:36:26.195
... he constantly exhorts us not see it that way.

01:36:26.230 --> 01:36:27.327
Why culture around us?

01:36:27.362 --> 01:36:30.414
The culture around us, by theologians,

01:36:30.449 --> 01:36:33.577
modern theologians who are trying in some way,

01:36:33.612 --> 01:36:37.036
in their minds, fit the truths of Scripture ...

01:36:37.071 --> 01:36:40.424
... with the supposed discoveries of science,

01:36:40.459 --> 01:36:43.212
so if you know anything about the history of science ...

01:36:43.247 --> 01:36:46.680
... you know it's incredibly unreliable way.

01:36:46.715 --> 01:36:50.720
So we are constantly being bombarded with this message ...

01:36:50.755 --> 01:36:53.782
... that we need to adjust our view.

01:36:53.817 --> 01:36:56.809
But I think there are many Christians who have a ...

01:36:56.844 --> 01:37:01.564
... idea that the historicity of Genesis does not ...

01:37:01.599 --> 01:37:05.651
... it's so important for Christianity.

01:37:05.686 --> 01:37:09.036
I think with that we have been ripped off.

01:37:09.071 --> 01:37:13.915
Somehow when you put those chapters ...

01:37:13.950 --> 01:37:17.622
... in a completely different and not historical category,

01:37:17.657 --> 01:37:20.333
What are you doing the rest of the Bible ...

01:37:20.368 --> 01:37:22.257
... it assumes that the Bible is true,

01:37:22.292 --> 01:37:24.760
the Bible treats it as historical truth,

01:37:24.795 --> 01:37:29.008
the Bible refers to all characters who were there?

01:37:29.043 --> 01:37:31.600
Does that then negates the whole Bible?

01:37:31.635 --> 01:37:36.641
Well, yes, and that was exactly the strategy ...

01:37:36.676 --> 01:37:40.150
... High criticism in the 18th and 19th century.

01:37:40.185 --> 01:37:44.863
They knew that if somehow you could attack ...

01:37:44.898 --> 01:37:49.654
... the first three or first eleven chapters of Genesis ...

01:37:49.689 --> 01:37:52.329
... you're done with everything.

01:37:52.364 --> 01:37:54.748
Well, George, all this brings us back ...

01:37:54.783 --> 01:37:59.789
... the notion that history is recorded in Genesis ...

01:38:00.080 --> 01:38:03.021
... or any real story is really critical for us ...

01:38:03.056 --> 01:38:05.962
... in terms of understanding what is happening around us.

01:38:05.997 --> 01:38:07.219
Yes.

01:38:07.254 --> 01:38:10.967
In fact, it reminds us how important it is history ...

01:38:11.002 --> 01:38:14.685
... to anchor all other human disciplines.

01:38:14.720 --> 01:38:19.434
It is the story that helps us to inform science for science ...

01:38:19.469 --> 01:38:23.455
... you can start your journey of discovery in the world.

01:38:23.490 --> 01:38:27.442
So what the story is to tell us what happened.

01:38:27.477 --> 01:38:29.944
And then what science tries to do is ...

01:38:29.979 --> 01:38:33.787
... ask the question, how did it happen? ...

01:38:33.822 --> 01:38:37.416
And then begins to explore how, mechanics,

01:38:37.451 --> 01:38:41.538
the structures that were present at these events.

01:38:41.573 --> 01:38:45.626
If you try to reverse that, if you try to make science ...

01:38:45.661 --> 01:38:50.148
... tell what really happened, then you end up ...

01:38:50.183 --> 01:38:54.635
... with a worldview that is constantly changing ...

01:38:54.670 --> 01:38:56.476
... where nothing is certain,

01:38:56.511 --> 01:39:01.476
and moral relativism will inevitably be the consequence.

01:39:01.511 --> 01:39:04.151
And God has given us that foundation.

01:39:04.186 --> 01:39:07.418
He has given us that foundation in the historical record.

01:39:07.453 --> 01:39:10.651
He has given us in the historical record that comes ...

01:39:10.686 --> 01:39:15.656
... to Genesis chapter 1 in the garden.

01:39:17.199 --> 01:39:20.870
Ultimately, I guess we always go back to our home.

01:39:20.905 --> 01:39:22.994
And for me my home is Colorado.

01:39:23.029 --> 01:39:25.047
I always think more clearly ...

01:39:25.082 --> 01:39:27.710
... when I'm out on the beauty of God's creation.

01:39:27.745 --> 01:39:31.714
I have been to many places and seen many things,

01:39:31.749 --> 01:39:33.764
but considering everything together,

01:39:33.799 --> 01:39:36.719
it is clear that nothing in the world makes sense ...

01:39:36.754 --> 01:39:39.514
... except in the light of Genesis.

01:39:42.307 --> 01:39:44.268
I love being in the mountains,

01:39:44.303 --> 01:39:46.579
especially in mountains how are you.

01:39:46.614 --> 01:39:49.111
They help us to have a good perspective,

01:39:49.146 --> 01:39:51.609
They help us realize that we are ...

01:39:51.644 --> 01:39:53.861
... small, finite, and vulnerable.

01:39:54.069 --> 01:39:56.119
They make us humble.

01:39:56.154 --> 01:39:58.997
And we need to be humble because we have a tendency ...

01:39:59.032 --> 01:40:04.038
... to base our ideas on our small set of experiences.

01:40:04.454 --> 01:40:06.666
That is why the wisdom of the ages tells us ...

01:40:06.701 --> 01:40:10.342
... again and again we know the story.

01:40:10.377 --> 01:40:14.861
Everything we've done up to this point has looked ...

01:40:14.896 --> 01:40:19.309
... the evidence shows us that the Word of God,

01:40:19.344 --> 01:40:24.183
the history that has been exposed to us in Genesis is true.

01:40:24.218 --> 01:40:27.808
God created the world in six days.

01:40:27.843 --> 01:40:31.399
Adam and Eve really existed.

01:40:31.434 --> 01:40:33.865
There was actually a fall.

01:40:33.900 --> 01:40:38.906
It really was a flood that destroyed the world and produced all this.

01:40:39.114 --> 01:40:43.244
It is glorious, but represents God's judgment.

01:40:43.279 --> 01:40:47.629
Everything supports what God has told us.

01:40:47.664 --> 01:40:51.210
Genesis is history.  True History.
