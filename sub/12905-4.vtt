00:00.167 --> 00:03.568
Wait! I'm here! I'm here!

00:06.073 --> 00:08.140
This is me!
I'll move it!

00:08.142 --> 00:11.276
I already started the ticket.
please? I'm so broke.

00:11.278 --> 00:13.578
I worked till 2 a.M.
There was nowhere to park.

00:13.580 --> 00:15.080
Yeah, i don't make the rules,
so...

00:15.082 --> 00:16.682
Come on, don't be a jerk.

00:19.320 --> 00:20.552
The hell is this?

00:20.554 --> 00:23.689
8 a.M. Street cleaning.
You didn't make it.

00:23.691 --> 00:26.658
great.
Thanks for nothing.

00:26.660 --> 00:27.993
I hope you have a horrible day.

00:27.995 --> 00:30.896
Oh, my god. Call 9-1-1!

00:30.898 --> 00:32.230
Why? Am i under arrest?

00:32.232 --> 00:33.398
somebody help!

00:33.400 --> 00:35.400
You know what?
Screw y--

00:40.074 --> 00:45.377
[ people grunting,
metal clacking ]

00:46.947 --> 00:48.313
Good morning.

00:48.315 --> 00:51.983
Good morning.

00:56.123 --> 00:58.557
Okay, so which musketeer
are you?

01:00.661 --> 01:02.227
Excuse me?

01:02.229 --> 01:05.263
I'm sorry. Um, i'm looking
for maura isles.

01:05.265 --> 01:07.432
This is the Ã©pÃ©e section.

01:07.434 --> 01:11.169
Dr. Isles is in
the sabre section.

01:11.171 --> 01:13.472
It's a whole different sword.

01:13.474 --> 01:14.840
Thank you.

01:16.610 --> 01:19.978
[ grunting
and clacking continue ]

01:41.602 --> 01:44.236
Good job.
Thank you.

01:44.238 --> 01:46.772
hi.
What do you think of the club?

01:46.774 --> 01:48.039
Well, i didn't know

01:48.041 --> 01:51.309
That rich people had
their own stormtroopers.

01:51.311 --> 01:53.044
it is popular
across all classes.

01:53.046 --> 01:54.479
You know, fencing is defined

01:54.481 --> 01:57.215
As the art of using the sword
scientifically.

01:57.217 --> 01:58.650
It's been around
since the 12th century.

01:58.652 --> 02:01.820
Mm. The only fencing i ever
heard about when i was little

02:01.822 --> 02:04.089
Involved stereos,
two guys named luigi,

02:04.091 --> 02:05.357
And a getaway car.

02:05.359 --> 02:07.692
well, this kind
won't get me arrested,

02:07.694 --> 02:11.596
But it will help my brain build
new neural pathways.

02:11.598 --> 02:13.298
Is that what this is about?

02:13.300 --> 02:16.535
You gonna fence your way
out of your brain condition?

02:16.537 --> 02:18.804
I'm just trying
a variety of activities.

02:18.806 --> 02:21.239
Learning new skills helps
the brain create new connections

02:21.241 --> 02:23.608
That can compensate
for damaged ones.

02:23.610 --> 02:25.310
So do you really think
that this could help you?

02:25.312 --> 02:26.611
Well, it could.

02:26.613 --> 02:29.414
If it doesn't, then at least
it's gonna give me good abs.

02:29.416 --> 02:30.549
mm-hmm.

02:30.551 --> 02:31.917
Wanna give it a try?

02:31.919 --> 02:34.853
Oh,<i> no.</i>

02:34.855 --> 02:37.989
i'm more of an Ã©pÃ©e girl.

02:37.991 --> 02:41.226
It's a whole different<i> sword.</i>

02:42.463 --> 02:43.628
Oh, do you mind?
Yeah, yeah.

02:44.965 --> 02:48.066
Sir maura isles' phone.

02:48.068 --> 02:49.668
Yeah, it's rizzoli.

02:49.670 --> 02:53.772
Okay. Uh, we'll be there
in about 10 minutes.

02:53.774 --> 02:55.440
Okay.

02:55.442 --> 02:57.309
Do you have something
to change into?

02:57.311 --> 02:58.743
Well,
what's wrong with this?

02:58.745 --> 03:00.712
I've worn sporty outfits
to the crime scene before.

03:00.714 --> 03:03.815
It's a full-body thong.

03:03.817 --> 03:05.951
Modern day chastity belt?

03:05.953 --> 03:08.086
Where you gonna put that?

03:08.088 --> 03:09.421
I don't wanna know.

03:34.548 --> 03:36.481
Tae kwon do, archery,
watercolor,

03:36.483 --> 03:38.617
And next week,
i start the piccolo.

03:38.619 --> 03:40.752
Sounds like the worst
summer camp ever.

03:40.754 --> 03:42.954
Well, do you have
other suggestions?

03:42.956 --> 03:45.991
Ice hockey. Yeah, because
we're short a player

03:45.993 --> 03:47.826
Against boston fire
next week.

03:47.828 --> 03:50.762
Oh, hockey would be beneficial
to my balance and coordination.

03:50.764 --> 03:53.365
But isn't that the sport
where people lose teeth?

03:53.367 --> 03:54.833
Not if you're good at it.

03:54.835 --> 03:55.967
Well, you know what?

03:55.969 --> 03:57.469
You get me the right
mouth guard, and i'm in.

03:57.471 --> 03:58.737
I'll try anything once.

03:58.739 --> 04:00.739
Really? I'm gonna hold you
to that.

04:00.741 --> 04:03.275
I mean, i don't know if you're
gonna have fun, but i know i am.

04:03.277 --> 04:05.076
Jack mccarty. 43.

04:05.078 --> 04:07.178
Mailman, apparently.

04:07.180 --> 04:08.914
9-millimeter
in the front seat.

04:08.916 --> 04:10.882
Yeah. Looks like he shot himself
in the mouth.

04:10.884 --> 04:14.386
Well, the bullet lodged itself
in the posterior skull

04:14.388 --> 04:17.722
At an angle consistent with
a self-inflicted gunshot.

04:17.724 --> 04:19.257
When did it happen?

04:19.259 --> 04:22.460
I'd say lividity puts time
of death at six to eight hours.

04:22.462 --> 04:24.296
Shot spotter register
anything about that time?

04:24.298 --> 04:27.532
No. Closed doors would've
muffled the sound.

04:27.534 --> 04:29.067
He leave a note?

04:29.069 --> 04:30.669
Only lives a couple blocks from
here, according to his license.

04:30.671 --> 04:33.872
Maybe he left one there,
drove over here.

04:33.874 --> 04:35.640
For what? The view?

04:35.642 --> 04:38.877
Well, the victim has a chip
in his second bicuspid.

04:38.879 --> 04:40.278
I'll need to check
the dental records

04:40.280 --> 04:42.681
To see if it was preexisting
or not.

04:42.683 --> 04:44.215
Damn.

04:44.217 --> 04:47.819
Yeah. Guess we're rootin' for
this one not to be a suicide.

04:47.821 --> 04:52.190
Wishing for murder.
That's a first.

04:54.761 --> 04:55.860
Uh-huh.

04:57.097 --> 04:59.431
Thanks, nina.

04:59.433 --> 05:01.199
10 months ago,
jack's wife filed for divorce.

05:01.201 --> 05:04.502
She and the kids
moved up to andover.

05:04.504 --> 05:07.973
So the wife doesn't
live here?

05:07.975 --> 05:10.108
Who left the door open?

05:41.575 --> 05:43.074
Freeze!
Boston police! Put it down!

05:43.076 --> 05:44.709
Federal agent.
Drop your weapon.

05:44.711 --> 05:47.012
What agency?
I'm a u.S. Postal inspector.

05:47.014 --> 05:48.913
Let me see some id.
I got a badge.

05:48.915 --> 05:52.283
My id's in the purse
in the other room.

05:52.285 --> 05:54.819
Don't you judge me.

05:56.856 --> 05:59.157
So you did all of this,
not an intruder?

05:59.159 --> 06:01.392
I was looking for evidence.
What are you guys doing here?

06:01.394 --> 06:03.661
Why don't you just stick to
answering our questions for now?

06:03.663 --> 06:06.365
I'm investigating
an illegal operation

06:06.366 --> 06:07.665
In one
of my postal facilities.

06:07.668 --> 06:09.400
Jack was supposed to meet me
last night with proof,

06:09.402 --> 06:10.803
But he never showed.

06:10.804 --> 06:12.170
What kind of illegal operation?

06:12.173 --> 06:14.539
Oh, it's big.
Mm-hmm, there's a lot to it.

06:14.541 --> 06:16.774
You might wanna sit down.
I'm good.

06:16.776 --> 06:18.577
I meant the silver fox.

06:18.578 --> 06:20.645
There's a chair over there
if you get tired.

06:20.647 --> 06:21.981
I'm good.

06:21.982 --> 06:23.281
Okay.

06:23.284 --> 06:25.416
A month ago, a janitor
in my roxbury post office

06:25.418 --> 06:26.517
Came to see me.

06:26.519 --> 06:28.286
He said he saw jack stealing
packages.

06:28.288 --> 06:30.755
So he confronts jack,
jack threatens his life,

06:30.757 --> 06:32.457
The janitor gets scared,
leaves town.

06:32.459 --> 06:34.226
Two days later,
he turned up dead.

06:34.227 --> 06:35.493
You think jack killed
the janitor?

06:35.495 --> 06:37.462
At first,
but jack has an alibi.

06:37.464 --> 06:39.764
I just think the janitor stuck
his nose where it didn't belong,

06:39.766 --> 06:42.400
And whatever's in those packages
is worth killing over.

06:42.402 --> 06:45.069
Which is what?
Which is<i> what</i> what?

06:45.072 --> 06:47.338
Which...What...

06:47.341 --> 06:48.573
What's in the packages?

06:48.575 --> 06:49.674
I don't know.

06:49.676 --> 06:51.676
Illegal contraband.
Jewels or drugs.

06:51.678 --> 06:54.679
We had a case last year
that involved rare pheasants.

06:54.681 --> 06:56.147
I didn't know pheasants
could be rare.

06:56.149 --> 06:57.649
Oh, they can be very rare.
You'd be surprised how rare --

06:57.650 --> 06:59.117
Okay, can we focus, please?

06:59.120 --> 07:00.318
If jack was
into something illegal,

07:00.320 --> 07:01.753
Then why did he wanna meet
with you?

07:01.755 --> 07:03.521
Because when jack heard that --
that the janitor was murdered,

07:03.524 --> 07:04.822
He got scared.

07:04.824 --> 07:08.394
So i offered to protect him
in exchange for the proof.

07:08.395 --> 07:09.827
You know,
i didn't check this --

07:09.829 --> 07:12.231
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
You can't go in there.

07:12.232 --> 07:14.198
And there it is.

07:14.200 --> 07:17.135
The condescending detective
tone.

07:17.137 --> 07:18.937
You think i'm a lesser species,
right?

07:18.938 --> 07:20.438
Just a lowly mail cop

07:20.440 --> 07:22.341
That gets to play in america's
awesome stamp collection?

07:22.342 --> 07:24.842
Huh? You think
you're the only one

07:24.844 --> 07:27.779
That gets to play with
the twin dragons?

07:31.986 --> 07:34.118
We need to secure the area.

07:34.120 --> 07:37.423
<i>I</i> am a federal agent
of the united states of america,

07:37.424 --> 07:40.558
Detective rizzoli.

07:40.560 --> 07:44.195
And<i> i...</i>
Respect that,

07:44.197 --> 07:45.863
Agent prescott.

07:45.865 --> 07:49.133
This is
a potential crime scene.

07:49.135 --> 07:51.502
Jack is dead.

07:51.505 --> 07:53.137
Oh, no.

07:53.139 --> 07:54.439
I'm sorry.

07:54.442 --> 07:56.375
Well, i was just hoping
he got scared off.

07:56.376 --> 07:58.110
We found his body
this morning.

07:58.111 --> 07:59.277
H-how'd he die?

07:59.279 --> 08:01.413
Well, it's still
under investigation.

08:01.414 --> 08:03.649
There's one thing i know
for sure --

08:03.650 --> 08:04.949
Jack mccarty was murdered.

08:12.358 --> 08:16.694
Hey, kiki!
What a nice surprise.
Aw!

08:16.697 --> 08:18.229
Would you mind giving these
to vince?

08:18.231 --> 08:19.464
It's our tax documents.

08:19.466 --> 08:22.834
You know,
because we file jointly now.
Oh.

08:22.837 --> 08:24.035
Being in love --

08:24.038 --> 08:26.971
It's the only time
taxes could seem romantic.

08:28.174 --> 08:30.641
Oh, yes, please.
To go, if you don't mind.

08:30.644 --> 08:32.743
i have an appointment
with my hairdresser,

08:32.745 --> 08:36.380
And the last time i was late,
she punished me with bangs.

08:37.584 --> 08:38.683
Mm-hmm.

08:38.685 --> 08:40.418
I remember being a newlywed.

08:40.420 --> 08:41.719
Yeah?

08:41.721 --> 08:44.522
All the sweet kisses
for nothing.
Mm-hmm.

08:44.524 --> 08:48.059
All the silly jokes only
the both of you can understand.

08:48.062 --> 08:49.827
Yeah.

08:49.829 --> 08:52.231
Yeah,
that was a long time ago.

08:56.370 --> 08:58.437
I don't know why
every employee thinks

08:58.438 --> 09:00.771
They need to dump their stuff
back here.

09:00.774 --> 09:03.741
I mean...What is this now?

09:03.743 --> 09:06.812
A blender? I already have
a blender back here.

09:08.181 --> 09:11.916
Um...I think that might be
my birthday gift from vince.

09:11.918 --> 09:13.117
What?

09:13.120 --> 09:15.120
Yeah. He was probably
hiding it back there.

09:15.121 --> 09:18.756
Oh. You wanted a blender?

09:18.758 --> 09:22.961
Well, i mean, we could use one,
which i may have mentioned.

09:22.962 --> 09:26.631
Oh. Well...You know.

09:26.633 --> 09:28.699
That's a good symbol.

09:28.702 --> 09:31.803
I mean, you're blending
your lives together.

09:31.804 --> 09:34.305
You can make soul smoothies.

09:34.308 --> 09:37.543
that's good.
That's good.

09:37.544 --> 09:39.310
Yeah, it'll be --
it'll be useful.

09:39.312 --> 09:40.545
Yeah. Sure.

09:40.548 --> 09:41.880
Yeah. Right.
Sure.

09:41.881 --> 09:43.582
Well, anyway, i gotta go.
Thanks for the coffee.

09:43.583 --> 09:45.149
Okay. Watch the bangs.

09:46.687 --> 09:48.953
I...I mean,

09:48.955 --> 09:52.490
He is the most unromantic jerk
i ever met.

09:52.492 --> 09:55.059
Vince korsak -- a blender.

09:57.430 --> 10:00.131
I had no idea postal inspectors
carried guns.

10:00.133 --> 10:01.699
Yeah. They have
the same training we do.

10:01.702 --> 10:04.402
But their cases
are about mail.

10:04.404 --> 10:06.938
Well, dad was a plumber.
His cases were about toilets.

10:06.940 --> 10:08.839
Yeah, but he wasn't armed.

10:08.841 --> 10:10.875
True.

10:10.877 --> 10:12.611
Do people
really mail birds?

10:12.612 --> 10:15.313
Pheasants, apparently.

10:15.315 --> 10:18.516
Everything about this guy's life
points to suicide.

10:18.519 --> 10:20.184
Credit cards
and bank statements.

10:20.187 --> 10:22.019
Yeah,
he was in serious debt.

10:22.021 --> 10:23.955
His car was
about to be repo'ed.

10:23.957 --> 10:25.289
Well, so what?

10:25.291 --> 10:27.192
So he gets involved
in a mail-stealing scheme

10:27.193 --> 10:28.860
To solve his money problems?

10:28.861 --> 10:30.995
All right, thank you.

10:30.997 --> 10:32.363
That was cj's boss.

10:32.365 --> 10:33.931
Her murdered janitor?

10:33.933 --> 10:36.101
Died in a slip and fall while
visiting his sister in new york.

10:36.102 --> 10:37.368
It was an accident?

10:37.370 --> 10:38.636
According to
the new york m.E., it was.

10:38.639 --> 10:39.904
Wasn't even an open case.

10:39.906 --> 10:42.240
Cj was told to leave it alone
weeks ago.

10:42.242 --> 10:44.675
Boss said she's a loose cannon.
He sent her to anger management.

10:44.678 --> 10:46.377
Wait. Didn't she almost
take a swing at jane?

10:46.380 --> 10:47.779
Well, yeah,

10:47.780 --> 10:49.548
But that's because she didn't
wanna hit the silver fox.

10:49.549 --> 10:51.250
yeah.

10:51.251 --> 10:54.586
Okay, so both she and her theory
are wacked...

10:54.587 --> 10:56.721
Which points us back to suicide.

11:12.472 --> 11:14.305
Here's jack mccarty's
dental records.

11:14.308 --> 11:15.774
Thank you.

11:17.277 --> 11:19.144
look at you.

11:19.145 --> 11:20.978
Shaking the babaloo,
are we?

11:20.981 --> 11:23.381
Well, the association
between work and mozart

11:23.383 --> 11:25.784
Is a well-worn neural pathway
in my brain,

11:25.785 --> 11:29.253
And i am forcing a new
electrochemical pattern to fire.

11:29.255 --> 11:31.188
Interesting.

11:31.190 --> 11:32.524
There's been a lot
of excellent results

11:32.525 --> 11:34.659
In neural retraining
in stroke victims.

11:34.661 --> 11:36.661
Oh, yes, and all kinds
of limbic impairment.

11:36.663 --> 11:37.862
And is there much research

11:37.865 --> 11:41.399
Using this technique
for chiari malformations?

11:41.401 --> 11:44.402
Just me, as far as i know.

11:44.404 --> 11:47.139
And are you considering
any other treatment options?

11:47.140 --> 11:51.375
Well, if my symptoms worsen,
i will think about surgery.

11:51.377 --> 11:53.144
Okay.

11:53.146 --> 11:55.012
So in the meantime, motown.

11:55.014 --> 11:58.082
Are you doubting my methods?
No, on the contrary.

11:58.084 --> 12:00.618
Stevie wonder practically
got me through university.

12:00.620 --> 12:02.353
For me,
it was always aretha.

12:02.356 --> 12:05.256
Yeah, we sing together
in the shower every morning.

12:05.258 --> 12:06.424
Which song?

12:06.426 --> 12:10.227
Only the best one --
"natural woman."

12:10.229 --> 12:11.562
Hey.

12:11.564 --> 12:13.130
you know,
i always wondered,

12:13.132 --> 12:16.867
What exactly is a...
A "natural woman"?

12:16.870 --> 12:20.639
Mm. You just gotta feel it,
kent.

12:20.640 --> 12:22.640
right here.

12:22.642 --> 12:24.409
Would you mind
filing these?

12:24.410 --> 12:25.943
Sure.

12:25.945 --> 12:29.146
I shall file them
like the natural man that i am.

12:33.553 --> 12:36.520
Are you neural retraining
or kent retraining?

12:36.523 --> 12:38.523
Both.

12:39.959 --> 12:41.625
So jack mccarty's
medical chart.

12:41.628 --> 12:42.928
Mm-hmm.

12:42.929 --> 12:44.428
Moderately high cholesterol,

12:44.430 --> 12:46.497
Allergies to sulfa,
walnuts, and peanuts,

12:46.499 --> 12:49.333
But otherwise,
a healthy 46-year-old male.

12:49.335 --> 12:51.035
I got his dental records,

12:51.037 --> 12:55.207
And his last exam two months ago
shows no chip.

12:55.208 --> 12:56.874
Interesting,
but not conclusive.

12:56.877 --> 13:00.044
That's what i said
until i found...

13:00.046 --> 13:02.848
A hematoma on the roof
of his mouth.

13:02.850 --> 13:05.050
Now that would take
a lot of force to cause.

13:05.052 --> 13:09.720
Same amount of force
it would cause the chip?

13:09.723 --> 13:11.122
Here's the bullet.

13:11.124 --> 13:14.493
Rub markings, like it
came out of a silencer.

13:14.495 --> 13:17.895
And there's one more thing.

13:17.898 --> 13:20.998
These markings suggest

13:21.000 --> 13:23.701
That he may have been
restrained.

13:23.704 --> 13:26.638
From what? Like a seat belt?
Well, that would be consistent

13:26.639 --> 13:28.606
With the width of
the contusions.

13:28.609 --> 13:30.741
so he was
immobilized from behind,

13:30.744 --> 13:32.410
And the gun was shoved
in his mouth.

13:32.412 --> 13:35.647
He<i> was</i> murdered.
Cj was right.

13:38.185 --> 13:39.683
See how long they last
without me.

13:39.686 --> 13:41.152
Anger issues, my ass!

13:41.154 --> 13:43.154
Loose cannon?! Oh, i got
your loose cannon!

13:43.157 --> 13:46.291
all my life i done had to fight
for every doggone thing i get...

13:46.293 --> 13:47.758
Your mother's calling me.
<i>All</i> my doggone life!

13:47.760 --> 13:49.593
Well, don't answer it.
Call her back later.

13:49.595 --> 13:50.928
We're about to have
our hands full.

13:50.930 --> 13:52.229
I...

13:52.231 --> 13:53.431
Oh,<i> hell,</i> no.

13:54.700 --> 13:56.333
Can -- can we just talk?

13:56.335 --> 13:58.602
Just fair warning, i'm really
in a mood to punch somebody.

13:58.604 --> 14:00.071
That little call to my boss
ratting me out

14:00.072 --> 14:01.907
Got me suspended.
Not my intention.

14:01.909 --> 14:04.141
Oh! Should i put that on
my unemployment application?

14:04.143 --> 14:05.610
Might be a good idea.

14:05.611 --> 14:06.945
Excuse me?!

14:06.947 --> 14:08.647
Don't think i'm afraid to punch
a fellow hottie.

14:08.649 --> 14:11.082
All right, i just meant that
now you have the time

14:11.083 --> 14:13.717
To work the case with us.

14:13.719 --> 14:15.519
You believe me?

14:15.522 --> 14:18.389
We do.

14:18.391 --> 14:20.225
So what do you say
we work together?

14:20.226 --> 14:21.993
Okay.

14:26.324 --> 14:28.257
There was nothing unusual
in jack's car?

14:28.259 --> 14:29.959
Or his house.

14:29.961 --> 14:31.694
Is there anyplace else
we can look,

14:31.696 --> 14:33.496
Anyplace that
he would've hidden

14:33.498 --> 14:34.897
Whatever proof
he was bringing you?

14:34.899 --> 14:36.232
Did you check with his ex-wife?

14:36.234 --> 14:38.701
Yes. She hasn't seen him
in over a week.

14:38.703 --> 14:39.936
Someone went
to a lot of trouble

14:39.938 --> 14:41.437
To make jack's death look
like a suicide.

14:41.439 --> 14:43.072
They could've done
the same thing with the janitor,

14:43.074 --> 14:44.473
Made it look like
an accident.

14:44.475 --> 14:46.475
Ah, then why go through all
the trouble of the cover-ups?

14:46.477 --> 14:48.344
'cause whatever's in those
packages is valuable enough

14:48.346 --> 14:49.879
They don't wanna leave
a trail behind.

14:49.881 --> 14:51.580
The post office does seize
over $30 million

14:51.582 --> 14:53.115
In drugs and jewels every year.

14:53.117 --> 14:56.886
Ah, don't forget the pheasants.
Mnh.

14:56.888 --> 15:00.756
Do you have a problem
with pheasants?

15:00.758 --> 15:04.060
No. I...Like all birds.

15:04.062 --> 15:05.995
I think what frankie meant
to ask is,

15:05.997 --> 15:09.699
Why would these criminals risk
such value in the mail?

15:09.701 --> 15:12.268
In theory, they could get lost
along the way.

15:12.270 --> 15:13.869
Because they<i> don't</i> get lost.

15:13.871 --> 15:16.205
"neither snow nor rain nor heat
nor gloom of night

15:16.207 --> 15:18.074
"stays these couriers
from the swift completion

15:18.076 --> 15:19.775
Of their appointed rounds."

15:19.777 --> 15:22.111
That's the --
the post office creed, right?

15:22.113 --> 15:25.214
Stop trying to kiss my ass.

15:25.216 --> 15:28.317
D-- okay, uh, what about
the post office itself?

15:28.319 --> 15:31.087
Do the employees have
changing rooms?

15:31.089 --> 15:32.588
Or their own mailboxes?

15:32.590 --> 15:34.957
Well, i did go to jack's branch
during my initial investigation.

15:34.959 --> 15:36.258
They have lockers,

15:36.260 --> 15:37.426
But i couldn't check 'em
'cause i couldn't get a warrant.

15:37.428 --> 15:40.429
Well, warrants-are-us.
Hmm.

15:47.839 --> 15:49.638
Csru finished the car.

15:49.640 --> 15:52.008
We found the missing piece
of tooth and a hair,

15:52.010 --> 15:53.676
So let's fast-track the dna.

15:53.678 --> 15:55.344
Do you wanna continue
with the neural retraining

15:55.346 --> 15:56.712
As we work?

15:56.714 --> 15:59.949
I was thinking about
a little bit of gladys knight.

15:59.951 --> 16:01.584
Oh, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You okay?

16:03.554 --> 16:05.321
Oh, gosh.

16:05.323 --> 16:07.023
i'm sorry.

16:07.025 --> 16:11.060
I think i just -- i didn't drink
enough water today.

16:13.264 --> 16:15.798
Thank you.

16:15.800 --> 16:20.536
I don't think hydration
is the problem here, maura.

16:20.538 --> 16:24.206
I had a look over the reports
that you asked me to file.

16:24.208 --> 16:27.243
There was an error
in the fisk autopsy.

16:27.245 --> 16:29.779
What kind of error?

16:29.781 --> 16:31.514
you spelled...

16:31.516 --> 16:34.617
you spelled
"myelomeningocele" wrong.

16:34.619 --> 16:39.688
Really? Myelomeningocele?

16:39.690 --> 16:42.124
It's a protrusion
or growth on the spine.

16:42.126 --> 16:44.026
I remember learning the term.

16:44.028 --> 16:46.729
First year medical school,
"gray's anatomy."

16:46.731 --> 16:49.899
M-y-l-i...

16:49.901 --> 16:51.767
M...

16:51.769 --> 16:53.636
M-y...

16:53.638 --> 16:56.238
No, it's an...E.

16:56.240 --> 16:59.108
It's m-y...

17:00.545 --> 17:03.446
Maura...

17:03.448 --> 17:04.880
I just have to say

17:04.882 --> 17:08.918
The surgical options have shown
some great results.

17:08.920 --> 17:10.152
Hey, maura,
you're friendly with

17:10.154 --> 17:13.422
The chief m.E. Of new york city,
right?

17:13.424 --> 17:15.724
Yes, i am. Uh, dr. Lutz.

17:15.726 --> 17:16.959
We need an autopsy report

17:16.961 --> 17:18.761
Went through his office
about a month ago.

17:18.763 --> 17:19.895
The name?

17:19.897 --> 17:21.230
Bob rasmussen.

17:21.232 --> 17:22.331
Janitor.

17:22.333 --> 17:23.732
We have reason to believe

17:23.734 --> 17:25.367
That someone staged his murder
to look like an accident.

17:25.369 --> 17:27.903
Well, i can't imagine dr. Lutz
making a mistake,

17:27.905 --> 17:30.506
But if he did, i am sure that
he would want to know about it

17:30.508 --> 17:32.908
And do absolutely everything
he can to correct it.

17:32.910 --> 17:35.411
Thanks. Hey.

17:46.991 --> 17:48.958
Yeah, yeah, everyone thinks
of us as "snail mail,"

17:48.960 --> 17:51.994
But we sort 30,000 pieces
of mail a an hour

17:51.996 --> 17:55.264
And deliver
209 million pieces of mail

17:55.266 --> 17:58.334
To 150 million
different addresses a year.

17:58.336 --> 18:01.370
Mm. You guys know any snails
that can do that?

18:01.372 --> 18:03.606
Can't say i do.

18:03.608 --> 18:06.041
Um, where on the floor
did jack work?

18:06.043 --> 18:08.010
He separated the mail
into the bins you see here.

18:08.012 --> 18:11.046
Each bin represents the route
of a different carrier.

18:11.048 --> 18:13.115
What were his relationships
like here?

18:13.117 --> 18:14.683
Anyone he didn't get along with?

18:14.685 --> 18:16.352
Not really. He was a great guy.

18:16.354 --> 18:17.653
Mm-hmm.

18:17.655 --> 18:21.023
Ah. Tough time
after the divorce.
Mm.

18:21.025 --> 18:24.059
I wish we would've done more
to help him.

18:24.061 --> 18:26.262
Here we are. Locker 125.

18:34.539 --> 18:35.871
Standard stuff.

18:35.873 --> 18:37.439
Clothes,

18:37.441 --> 18:39.175
Water bottle, granola bar.

18:39.177 --> 18:41.710
Okay. We'll take it to the lab
and have it swept.

18:41.712 --> 18:43.279
Thank you very much
for your help.

18:43.281 --> 18:44.747
Of course.

18:44.749 --> 18:47.449
Hey, c-can i ask, uh, why you're
looking through jack's stuff?

18:47.451 --> 18:50.252
I...Thought he committed
suicide.

18:50.254 --> 18:52.421
No, bpd investigates
all suicides.

18:52.423 --> 18:54.456
Just part of the job.

18:54.458 --> 18:58.027
Thanks.
Sure.

19:00.398 --> 19:02.064
I wonder why benjamin franklin
agreed to be

19:02.066 --> 19:03.566
The first postmaster general.

19:03.568 --> 19:04.833
Are you kidding?

19:04.835 --> 19:06.969
He got to "frank"
all his letters, for one thing.

19:08.439 --> 19:09.605
"frank"?

19:09.607 --> 19:11.373
Send them for free.
No stamps needed.

19:11.375 --> 19:13.742
Although technically, stamps
didn't exist back then, so...

19:13.744 --> 19:17.947
Well, prior to 1847, dates,
rates, and a letter's origin

19:17.949 --> 19:19.715
Were all handwritten.
Mm-hmm.

19:19.717 --> 19:22.084
Yeah, i'm a bit of a philatelist
myself.

19:22.086 --> 19:24.186
A philatelist?

19:24.188 --> 19:25.588
Sounds dirty.

19:25.590 --> 19:28.123
It means i collect stamps.

19:28.125 --> 19:30.125
No. No way to make that dirty.

19:31.329 --> 19:33.495
You know, i'm a member
of the aps.

19:33.497 --> 19:35.464
the american
philatelist society?

19:35.466 --> 19:37.433
Mm-hmm. You should come
to the convention next summer.

19:37.435 --> 19:41.003
Oh, no, i-i mean, i couldn't.
I'm -- i'm only amateur.

19:41.005 --> 19:42.905
Maura, come on now.
Don't be bashful.

19:42.907 --> 19:44.373
You said that you wanted
to try new things.

19:44.375 --> 19:47.810
June. Poughkeepsie.
It'll be<i> wild.</i>

19:47.812 --> 19:48.877
really?

19:48.879 --> 19:49.912
Mm-hmm.

19:49.914 --> 19:52.481
okay.
Okay! How fun!

19:52.483 --> 19:54.583
Well, let's talk more convention
after i use the ladies' room.

19:54.585 --> 19:57.186
All right.
Ooh!

19:58.756 --> 20:01.156
Hi! Have a seat.

20:01.158 --> 20:03.559
Hi. Oh. Cj.

20:03.561 --> 20:06.195
Hi.
Hi. Uh, you know,

20:06.197 --> 20:07.396
I think we're just gonna grab
a seat at the bar.

20:09.567 --> 20:10.933
It's my, uh, my rbf, right?

20:10.935 --> 20:12.701
My resting bitch face
that scares people away?

20:12.703 --> 20:17.506
No. I assure you, they're used
to mine. It...

20:17.508 --> 20:20.609
Maybe you just -- just wanna try
a little less intensity.

20:20.611 --> 20:22.211
I'm not intense!

20:22.213 --> 20:25.214
<i>I</i> have passion.

20:25.216 --> 20:27.416
And passion is what got you
into anger management?

20:27.418 --> 20:29.685
Well, sometimes passion
makes you wanna punch people.

20:29.687 --> 20:31.754
Mm. God, don't i know it.

20:31.756 --> 20:34.523
No!
Maybe it's about learning...

20:34.525 --> 20:36.425
how to work<i> with</i> people.

20:36.427 --> 20:40.996
You know, as opposed
to wanting to punch them.

20:40.998 --> 20:45.301
Mmm. I know somebody
i'd like to work with.

20:45.303 --> 20:48.337
Hot bunz at 3 o'clock.
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

20:48.339 --> 20:51.707
Really?
Yeah. I have a type.

20:51.709 --> 20:54.276
It's the khakis.
In the khakis? Really?

20:54.278 --> 20:56.045
Khakis, yes.
Are you judging me?

20:56.047 --> 20:57.446
No, i...
Okay.

20:57.448 --> 21:00.382
I would never...
You know what i mean?

21:03.954 --> 21:07.189
The x-rays from
the janitor's autopsy report.

21:07.191 --> 21:10.793
See here? The tiny bone fragment
in the cervical canal?

21:10.795 --> 21:13.996
It chipped off of c2 up here
in the cervical spine.

21:13.998 --> 21:17.333
The only way that could occur
is from a rotational break.

21:17.335 --> 21:20.269
Dr. Lutz was mortified
that he missed it.

21:20.271 --> 21:22.171
So he didn't die
from falling down the stairs?

21:22.173 --> 21:25.074
No. His neck was snapped,
likely from behind.

21:25.076 --> 21:26.375
Same m.O. As our victim.

21:26.377 --> 21:28.210
Somebody followed him
to new york to kill him.

21:28.212 --> 21:29.678
They really didn't want
any loose ends.

21:29.680 --> 21:31.280
What the hell
were these guys into?

21:32.450 --> 21:33.782
Is this the stuff
from the gym bag?

21:33.784 --> 21:35.584
Uh, yes. I haven't processed
it all yet.

21:35.586 --> 21:38.754
But kent didn't find any prints
other than the victim's.

21:38.756 --> 21:41.423
Didn't his medical records say
that he had a peanut allergy?

21:41.425 --> 21:42.758
Yes, it did.

21:42.760 --> 21:45.327
Well, then why has he got
a peanut butter granola bar?

21:45.329 --> 21:49.498
I mean...That can't be good
for him, right?

21:52.136 --> 21:54.169
It's a postal barcode.

21:54.171 --> 21:55.404
Why did he hide it there?

21:55.406 --> 21:56.538
Maybe it was the only way
he could get it out

21:56.540 --> 21:58.307
Without anyone noticing.

21:58.309 --> 22:00.075
Jack mccarty died for this?

22:00.077 --> 22:01.910
Well, i'm guessing that whatever
that barcode was attached to

22:01.912 --> 22:03.579
Was not a box of pheasants.

22:07.952 --> 22:10.752
These 65 bars represent
usps intelligent mail barcode.

22:10.754 --> 22:12.921
Or what we in the biz call
the 4cb.

22:12.923 --> 22:15.290
It was introduced in 2013
to provide more information

22:15.292 --> 22:17.025
Than its predecessor,
postnet.

22:17.027 --> 22:19.561
You do your homework, girl!

22:19.563 --> 22:21.063
What does it tell us about
our package?

22:21.065 --> 22:23.165
Well, these bars represent
the zip plus four.

22:23.167 --> 22:26.401
and is that the closest that we
can get to a final destination?

22:26.403 --> 22:27.503
Well, it can get you down

22:27.505 --> 22:28.904
To a specific
postal delivery route.

22:28.906 --> 22:30.372
There are hundreds of packages
on each route.

22:30.374 --> 22:32.341
Too many to search.

22:32.343 --> 22:33.942
So if we can't get
a destination,

22:33.944 --> 22:35.777
Can this barcode help us find
its origin?

22:35.779 --> 22:39.648
Yes. The middle bars can tell us
the sender's mailer id.

22:39.650 --> 22:42.818
This translates
to mailer id 43135,

22:42.820 --> 22:44.286
And that belongs to...

22:45.422 --> 22:47.156
South paw sporting goods
in miami.

22:47.158 --> 22:48.757
A sporting goods store?

22:48.759 --> 22:52.294
What are they mailing,
rare snakeskin baseball gloves?

22:52.296 --> 22:53.962
That look funny to you?

22:55.933 --> 22:58.233
Yeah, it looks under-inked.

22:58.235 --> 23:00.202
Forged?
Yeah, it could be.

23:00.204 --> 23:01.236
The post office uses

23:01.238 --> 23:02.671
Technologically advanced
printers.

23:02.673 --> 23:04.139
But it looks like this barcode
was printed on

23:04.141 --> 23:06.408
An old-school
dot matrix printer.

23:06.410 --> 23:08.844
Have you ever considered a job
at the post office?

23:08.846 --> 23:10.245
No.

23:10.247 --> 23:11.580
Is there a way to tell where
the package is actually from?

23:11.582 --> 23:13.715
Or more importantly,
where it was going?

23:13.717 --> 23:15.017
Yeah, the post office has

23:15.019 --> 23:16.752
This cool mail isolation
and tracking program.

23:16.754 --> 23:19.955
It takes pictures of every piece
of mail at its origin point.

23:19.957 --> 23:22.491
So if miami has pictures
of the package

23:22.493 --> 23:23.959
That's attached
to this barcode,

23:23.961 --> 23:25.694
We can see who was supposed
to receive it.

23:25.696 --> 23:26.962
Yes.

23:26.964 --> 23:28.530
How to get ahold of it, though?
Tough to get a warrant.

23:28.532 --> 23:30.232
Well, i may be suspended,
but i still have friends.

23:30.234 --> 23:33.001
Let me just make a call.

23:33.003 --> 23:34.570
I just want the best for you,
girl.

23:34.572 --> 23:36.705
that's the only reason
i said that.

23:39.777 --> 23:44.179


23:44.181 --> 23:47.282
Your gift stinks.

23:47.284 --> 23:49.885
That's why
you've been calling me?
Yes.

23:49.887 --> 23:52.621
Look, the -- the -- this blender
is battery-powered.

23:52.623 --> 23:56.124
You gave your first wife
sneakers for a wedding present.

23:56.126 --> 23:58.093
She played basketball.

23:58.095 --> 24:01.230
You gave a<i> roof rake</i>
to your second wife?

24:01.232 --> 24:03.432
She stills uses it
on<i> my</i> house.

24:03.434 --> 24:07.869
Exactly. That's why none
of those marriages worked out.

24:07.871 --> 24:11.440
Vince...

24:11.442 --> 24:14.042
Maybe it's time
you leaned towards

24:14.044 --> 24:16.311
Your more romantic side.

24:16.313 --> 24:19.014
And that's what
makes it last.

24:19.016 --> 24:20.682
Kiki mentioned when we were
at the mall last week

24:20.684 --> 24:23.118
That we needed a blender.

24:23.120 --> 24:25.320
I mentioned last week
that i needed a mammogram.

24:25.322 --> 24:28.357
You wanna make an appointment
at the doctor for my birthday?

24:28.359 --> 24:30.559
vince.

24:30.561 --> 24:35.197
Giving a gift is just another
chance to remind our loved ones

24:35.199 --> 24:38.100
How we feel about them.

24:38.102 --> 24:41.303
What's the damn blender say
to kiki?

24:45.709 --> 24:48.010
how we doing?

24:48.012 --> 24:52.180
Call worked. We're about to get
the photo of our package.

24:52.182 --> 24:55.050
Really? You're not gonna give up
your chair for an elder?

24:55.052 --> 24:56.285
What?

24:58.822 --> 25:00.822
Oh! Yeah. Yeah. Of course.

25:00.824 --> 25:03.425
Okay, cj, enough.
I'm not an elder.

25:03.427 --> 25:05.560
I'm not a silver fox. Got it?

25:05.562 --> 25:09.298
I'm sorry. You just remind me of
a mentor i used to have.

25:09.300 --> 25:11.366
Greatest thing in the world was
when he told me,

25:11.368 --> 25:13.335
"you did good work."

25:13.337 --> 25:16.371
The nickname was out of respect.

25:16.373 --> 25:18.273
Oh.

25:18.275 --> 25:23.612
Okay, well, then...
Thank you.

25:23.614 --> 25:25.380
there it is.

25:25.382 --> 25:27.382
800 north pope street.

25:27.384 --> 25:29.584
Yeah, but pope street
only runs south.

25:29.586 --> 25:31.853
The address is a fake,
or it's a mistake.

25:31.855 --> 25:33.188
Nina, can you see
how many other packages

25:33.190 --> 25:34.656
Were sent to that address?

25:37.828 --> 25:39.494
Here we go.

25:39.496 --> 25:41.396
There must be a hundred or more.

25:41.398 --> 25:43.065
So the address wasn't a mistake.

25:43.067 --> 25:44.966
What happens to mail
that's undeliverable?

25:44.968 --> 25:46.668
Well, it goes to a dead letter
bin in each post office,

25:46.670 --> 25:49.137
Then its usually shipped to the
dead letter office in atlanta.

25:49.139 --> 25:50.839
But i'm guessing
these were intercepted

25:50.841 --> 25:53.608
Before they were rerouted
to atlanta.

25:53.610 --> 25:55.143
That was our victim's job.

25:55.145 --> 25:56.478
Well, it's a smart plan.

25:56.480 --> 25:58.413
This way, you can't trace
the sender or receiver.

25:58.415 --> 26:00.182
They both have
plausible deniability.

26:00.184 --> 26:01.650
Mm-hmm.

26:01.652 --> 26:03.785
Nina, can you find when the next
package is supposed to arrive

26:03.787 --> 26:06.988
At the pope street address?

26:13.130 --> 26:15.263
Dna reports on the hair.

26:15.265 --> 26:17.866
Oh. Thank you.

26:25.109 --> 26:28.210
This is
a list of neurosurgeons.

26:28.212 --> 26:29.711
Yes.

26:32.149 --> 26:35.016
Ones who specialize
in chiari malformations.

26:35.018 --> 26:36.852
I didn't ask you
to do this.

26:36.854 --> 26:41.656
No. And i knew you'd be upset if
i told you that i<i> was</i> doing it.

26:44.395 --> 26:46.928
The top guy
for posterior fossa compressions

26:46.930 --> 26:49.297
Is dr. Richards
at mass general.

26:49.299 --> 26:51.700
And dr. Lambeau
at brigham and women's

26:51.702 --> 26:53.368
Specializes
in spinal laminectomy --

26:53.370 --> 26:56.304
Kent, stop.

26:56.306 --> 26:58.039
This isn't part of your job,

26:58.041 --> 27:00.375
Which i what i believe
you should be doing right now.

27:03.847 --> 27:06.281
I didn't mean to upset you.

27:08.786 --> 27:10.819
I was only trying to help.

27:17.094 --> 27:21.563
I've processed all the data
on the 800 north pope packages.

27:21.565 --> 27:22.998
Looks like they always land
in the post office

27:23.000 --> 27:24.533
Every tuesday and thursday.

27:24.535 --> 27:26.034
Today's thursday.

27:26.036 --> 27:28.870
I called miami to confirm.
Another one's definitely coming.

27:28.872 --> 27:30.305
With jack dead,
somebody else must

27:30.307 --> 27:31.940
Be picking up those packages
from the dead letter bin.

27:31.942 --> 27:33.175
We need to get eyes
in that post office

27:33.177 --> 27:34.309
And get that package.

27:34.311 --> 27:35.377
Well, how do we do that

27:35.379 --> 27:36.812
Without alerting
whoever's picking it up?

27:36.814 --> 27:38.146
Go undercover.

27:38.148 --> 27:39.714
Well, janitorial staff
is contracted

27:39.716 --> 27:40.982
Outside of the post office.

27:40.984 --> 27:42.083
That's really the only way
we can do it

27:42.085 --> 27:43.985
Without setting off
alarm bells.

27:43.987 --> 27:45.620
I've already been seen
in the post office.

27:45.622 --> 27:48.089
Me, too.
Me, too.

27:51.662 --> 27:54.496
You and me, foxy.

27:54.498 --> 27:56.198
Yeah. Foxy.

27:56.200 --> 27:57.899
Yeah.

28:08.520 --> 28:10.486
<i> All clear so far.</i>

28:10.488 --> 28:12.121
This is my turf.

28:12.123 --> 28:13.856
I wish i could be in there,
you know, and take 'em out.

28:13.858 --> 28:16.292
Okay, let's try to remember
our conversation

28:16.294 --> 28:19.896
About working<i> with</i> people.

28:19.898 --> 28:21.964
Korsak, incoming.

28:25.236 --> 28:26.502
Not our fish.

28:26.504 --> 28:28.204
Don't like the way
you use your tone.

28:28.206 --> 28:29.705
It's not what you say,
it's the way you say it.

28:29.707 --> 28:31.174
it's not about tone.
It's your tone, your tone.

28:31.176 --> 28:32.608
It's the raspiness,
and it's a lower register,

28:32.610 --> 28:34.043
And it makes me feel
very uncomfortable.

28:34.045 --> 28:36.079
I understand
why you've been fired now.

28:40.618 --> 28:42.085
Manager making his rounds.

28:45.790 --> 28:48.624
Nope. He's our man.

28:48.626 --> 28:50.393
Police. What do you have there?

28:50.395 --> 28:53.930
shit.
Not so fast.

28:57.836 --> 29:00.269
Hi.

29:00.271 --> 29:01.637
Hi, kiki.

29:01.639 --> 29:03.906
I thought i wasn't gonna see you
before your party.

29:03.908 --> 29:06.109
Well, you know, i was just
picking up some tax stuff.

29:06.111 --> 29:09.212
Um, vince said
he left it back here.

29:09.214 --> 29:12.014
<i>[ william bell's "we got</i>
<i>something good" playing ]</i>

29:12.016 --> 29:15.885
Okay. Kiki, the way i see it,
you have two choices.

29:15.887 --> 29:17.186
Choice number one,

29:17.188 --> 29:19.889
You tell vince you don't want
the blender.

29:19.891 --> 29:22.492
Yeah, i know, but i just --
i don't wanna hurt his feelings.

29:22.494 --> 29:25.228
Okay, so then go
to option two -- "the face."

29:25.230 --> 29:27.230
I've been doing it
for 30 years.

29:27.232 --> 29:28.865
The what?

29:28.867 --> 29:32.768
observe.

29:32.770 --> 29:35.171
Oh, frank.

29:35.173 --> 29:39.942
For our 20th anniversary,
after i bore you three children,

29:39.944 --> 29:42.211
You gave me the same box
of caramels

29:42.213 --> 29:44.580
You've always given me.

29:44.582 --> 29:47.717
oh, honey,
thank you so much.

29:49.220 --> 29:50.987
Works like a charm.

29:50.989 --> 29:53.990
Hmm, except you and frank
are divorced.

29:53.992 --> 29:56.259
Yes, because i stopped
doing the face.

29:56.261 --> 30:00.196
He went looking for it
elsewhere.

30:00.198 --> 30:01.898
All right, come on.
You try it.

30:01.900 --> 30:05.535
Oh.
Try it!

30:05.537 --> 30:06.802
okay.

30:09.340 --> 30:13.109
Thank you! I love it!

30:13.111 --> 30:14.443
L-less eyebrow.

30:14.445 --> 30:17.346
Thank you. I love it.

30:23.288 --> 30:25.288
hi.

30:25.290 --> 30:26.856
Did you get the dna back
on that hair?

30:26.858 --> 30:29.725
Because i think that we've got
our man upstairs.

30:29.727 --> 30:32.094
Well, i'm not so sure
that you have your man,

30:32.096 --> 30:34.964
Because the dna says that
your man is a woman.

30:34.966 --> 30:38.034
What? Is this the file?

30:38.036 --> 30:40.036
No, uh, that's not
the right one.
What is it?

30:42.507 --> 30:45.107
It's a list of neurosurgeons
that specialize in...

30:46.411 --> 30:49.378
Surgical treatments
for chiari malformations.

30:49.380 --> 30:50.880
I thought you were
feeling better.

30:50.882 --> 30:54.650
What about the whole...
Neural highway thing?

30:54.652 --> 30:58.087
In time, it can be effective.

30:58.089 --> 31:00.022
The truth is, i think
i've just been using it

31:00.024 --> 31:02.525
To avoid the surgery.

31:02.527 --> 31:06.429
It's okay to be scared,
maura.

31:06.431 --> 31:09.031
It's not the surgery
that scares me.

31:09.033 --> 31:11.100
I just...

31:13.071 --> 31:14.804
i guess i'm just afraid

31:14.806 --> 31:18.441
Of what will happen if
it doesn't work.

31:18.443 --> 31:20.209
You know, jane,
i have always been --

31:20.211 --> 31:21.944
The smartest person
in the room?

31:21.946 --> 31:23.212
I wasn't gonna say that.

31:23.214 --> 31:26.048
I said it.

31:26.050 --> 31:30.953
What if i'm not me anymore?

31:30.955 --> 31:33.756
Okay. Listen to me.

31:33.758 --> 31:38.761
Okay, you are always
gonna be you. Okay?

31:38.763 --> 31:41.797
Your intelligence is not
what defines you.

31:41.799 --> 31:45.034
You are kind and generous
and loving,

31:45.036 --> 31:49.605
And you are the best friend that
a person could ever ask for.

31:49.607 --> 31:52.308
Okay, that woman is always
gonna be there,

31:52.310 --> 31:55.811
Whether the surgery works
or not.

31:55.813 --> 31:57.179
Thank you.

31:58.816 --> 32:02.051
Your brain is not
what i love about you, maura.

32:02.053 --> 32:03.552
What i love about you

32:03.554 --> 32:09.158
Is that you took my mother in,
and now i don't have to.

32:09.160 --> 32:10.960
I love that about you.

32:10.962 --> 32:13.963
deeply.

32:13.965 --> 32:15.531
Actually, it's not very smart
that you did that.

32:15.533 --> 32:17.099
Maybe it's...Mm, advanced.

32:17.101 --> 32:19.635
Okay, fine.
I will make the appointment.

32:19.637 --> 32:21.137
Okay.

32:21.139 --> 32:22.672
Just keep my mother.

32:37.655 --> 32:40.289
I'm looking inside your soul.

32:45.096 --> 32:49.298
500 tabs of oxy
at 60 bucks a pop. That's...

32:49.300 --> 32:51.534
30 grand a package.

32:51.536 --> 32:55.304
Derek, you know that mailing
drugs is a federal crime.

32:55.306 --> 32:57.973
You're going away
for a long time.

32:57.975 --> 33:00.276
Or you can tell us
who you're working for.

33:00.278 --> 33:01.577
I don't know what you mean.

33:01.579 --> 33:06.349
You're looking at a minimum
of 10 years.

33:06.351 --> 33:08.184
Why would you cover
for these people?

33:08.186 --> 33:10.052
'cause it's better than
a bullet to the brain.

33:10.054 --> 33:12.221
Please. You'll never make it
out of lockup.

33:12.223 --> 33:14.256
When your business partners
find out that we have you here,

33:14.258 --> 33:16.625
There's gonna be a shiv
with your name on it.

33:19.931 --> 33:21.330
Okay.

33:23.601 --> 33:26.102
Derek, you don't have as much
as a traffic ticket.

33:26.104 --> 33:27.703
You took your sister
and her family in

33:27.705 --> 33:29.171
After she lost her job.

33:29.173 --> 33:32.842
You coach t-ball
on the weekends.

33:32.844 --> 33:36.345
How did you get mixed up
in this?

33:36.347 --> 33:39.548
My guess is you got trapped.

33:44.756 --> 33:48.491
I had a car accident about...

33:48.493 --> 33:50.926
Six years ago.

33:50.928 --> 33:54.764
I messed up my back really bad.

33:54.766 --> 33:59.235
I got addicted to oxy.

33:59.237 --> 34:02.238
When my script ran out,
i found a dealer.

34:02.240 --> 34:05.341
And about a year ago,

34:05.343 --> 34:06.609
The dealer threatened
to cut me off

34:06.611 --> 34:09.779
Unless i got the packages
through.

34:09.781 --> 34:13.048
How was jack mccarty
involved?

34:13.050 --> 34:16.519
It was only supposed to be
a couple of times.

34:16.521 --> 34:20.923
But the packages kept coming.

34:20.925 --> 34:23.025
I needed help.

34:23.027 --> 34:25.828
And you knew
that jack needed the money.

34:25.830 --> 34:29.231
I swear, i had -- had nothing
to do with his death.

34:29.233 --> 34:30.666
Do you need to be somewhere?

34:34.872 --> 34:37.072
The drop's tonight, isn't it?

34:37.074 --> 34:40.109
If i don't show,
i'm a dead man.

34:40.111 --> 34:42.178
Derek, we can protect you,

34:42.180 --> 34:45.948
But we need to know
who your dealer is.

34:45.950 --> 34:47.049
What's her name?

34:52.390 --> 34:54.490
Rachel hanson.

34:54.492 --> 34:55.891
What time are you supposed
to meet her?

34:59.630 --> 35:00.696
9.

35:27.876 --> 35:30.243
Okay, our guy's in place.

35:30.245 --> 35:32.779
Almost 9:00. Any minute now.

35:32.781 --> 35:35.148
<i> Frankie, you all set?</i>

35:35.150 --> 35:37.950
Roger that.

35:37.952 --> 35:40.453
Got a car pulling up.

35:48.897 --> 35:50.563
It's a woman.
Description matches.

35:50.565 --> 35:51.597
<i> Bingo.</i>

35:54.903 --> 35:56.969
Once she passes the mailbox

35:56.971 --> 35:58.037
<i>Across the street,</i>
<i>leave the duffel on the bench</i>

35:58.039 --> 35:59.806
<i>And walk away.</i>

35:59.808 --> 36:01.441
I'll make the drop.

36:09.751 --> 36:12.418
[ car door closes,
engine starts ]

36:12.420 --> 36:14.454
Nobody move until she's got
possession of that bag.

36:14.456 --> 36:15.521
<i> She won't</i>
<i>take the duffel bag</i>

36:15.523 --> 36:17.223
<i>Until the car's</i>
<i>out of sight.</i>

36:23.298 --> 36:24.430
She's got it. I'm going in.

36:30.371 --> 36:32.271
Police! Freeze!

36:34.442 --> 36:36.476
Uhh!

36:46.254 --> 36:48.888
Uhh!

36:51.092 --> 36:53.659
Ooh.

36:56.197 --> 36:57.763
Look at that.

36:57.765 --> 36:59.165
you finally
got to punch somebody.

36:59.167 --> 37:01.133
Yeah. It hurts more
than you'd think.

37:01.135 --> 37:03.870
It does. Good job, cj.

37:03.872 --> 37:05.171
Thank you.

37:08.443 --> 37:10.243
Oh!

37:10.245 --> 37:11.377
i may be getting old.

37:11.379 --> 37:13.980
Right now
retirement sounds sweet.

37:13.982 --> 37:16.015
when you leave,
cj may snatch you up.

37:17.185 --> 37:19.051
yes, sir, meet at the airport.

37:19.053 --> 37:22.688
my boss found an oxy smuggling
ring in new york,

37:22.690 --> 37:24.257
And he wants me on a plane
to help consult.

37:24.259 --> 37:26.492
You got reinstated.
That's great!
Yeah.

37:26.494 --> 37:29.695
I just don't know how i get over
two men dying on my watch.

37:30.965 --> 37:32.598
Mm, you don't.

37:32.600 --> 37:36.135
But there's still a lot of
people out there we<i> can</i> help.

37:36.137 --> 37:37.803
You're all right, rizzoli.

37:37.805 --> 37:39.372
You, too.

37:39.374 --> 37:41.340
Bye, foxy.

37:41.342 --> 37:45.177
ooh.

37:45.179 --> 37:47.146
I'd like to say i'm sorry
to see her go, but...

37:47.148 --> 37:49.081
You're tired.

37:49.083 --> 37:52.351
I like her, but...Whoa!
She's exhausting.

37:53.788 --> 37:55.454
Don't you think?

38:04.065 --> 38:05.698
Thanks for being here,
everybody.

38:05.700 --> 38:08.267
oh, we're just here
for the cake.
That's true.

38:08.269 --> 38:10.469
W-- yeah, ma, i want a -- i want
a big one with a lot of icing.

38:10.471 --> 38:11.737
Me, too.

38:11.739 --> 38:13.506
Oh, me, three. Here we go.
Okay. Ah! Ah! Ah!

38:13.508 --> 38:15.675
Ah! The birthday girl gets
the first piece.

38:15.677 --> 38:16.809
All right.

38:16.811 --> 38:19.011
The birthday girl also gets
a present.

38:19.013 --> 38:20.746
Whoo!
Oh!

38:20.748 --> 38:24.817
[ angela and frankie

38:27.889 --> 38:29.455
is there a face
for this?

38:29.457 --> 38:31.424
i don't know.

38:31.426 --> 38:33.559
'cause we make
beautiful music together.

38:33.561 --> 38:34.594
Aw.

38:34.596 --> 38:35.795
i love it.

38:35.797 --> 38:36.829
Give it a shake.

Oh!

38:44.806 --> 38:46.505
It's your birthstone

38:46.507 --> 38:49.241
To remind you that i'll always
be there for you no matter what.

38:49.243 --> 38:52.211
Vince, that's so romantic.
Thank you.

38:52.213 --> 38:54.280
You didn't think i'd really get
you a tambourine, did you?

38:54.282 --> 38:56.382
Yes.

Oh. The new karaoke machine.
Anybody wanna give it a whirl?

Okay, everybody, i'd like to
give you all a little treat.

39:04.892 --> 39:06.058
This is a scottish classic

No! No, don't do it!
No!

Really?
Unh-unh!

Why?
Well, um, someone has
been wanting...

39:16.804 --> 39:19.538
...To try new things.

39:19.540 --> 39:22.174
Ah, no, jane.
I do not sing in public.
Hmm.

39:22.176 --> 39:23.509
Don't be shy now.

I hear you singing in the house
all the time, maura.

39:26.347 --> 39:28.914
Yeah. Come on, you said
you'd try anything once. Once.
