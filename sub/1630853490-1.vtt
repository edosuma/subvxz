WEBVTT

00:09.593 --> 00:11.929
Okay. Let's try this one more time.

00:13.055 --> 00:15.974
Hi. Yeah. Sheila Rubin's the name.

00:16.058 --> 00:19.102
You've already heard of me?
You're kidding.

00:19.186 --> 00:21.772
I had no idea anyone knew who I was.

00:21.855 --> 00:23.398
How embarrassing.

00:24.107 --> 00:27.861
I'm just a fitness instructor,
but I love what I do.

00:28.445 --> 00:30.072
The dress? I've had it forever.

00:30.155 --> 00:33.200
It's actually-- It's really comfortable.
It's this piece I--

00:34.868 --> 00:35.953
Just a second.

00:37.162 --> 00:39.081
All right, can't hide in here all night.

00:39.164 --> 00:41.333
Time to get out there. Give it a spin.

00:41.416 --> 00:43.710
Tits up, wrap off.

00:43.794 --> 00:46.547
That's it. You got this.

00:46.630 --> 00:48.423
Keep those shoulders back.

00:49.091 --> 00:51.093
Okay. Showtime.

00:58.058 --> 00:59.560
Get a good look, honey?

01:03.063 --> 01:05.816
Doesn't look like anyone here
is much of a threat.

01:05.899 --> 01:07.860
Not that there's much competition here.

01:07.943 --> 01:11.321
It's San Diego, not Paris. But still.

01:11.405 --> 01:12.656
Let's go.

01:12.739 --> 01:14.741
Of course he wants to leave.
It's not his party.

01:14.825 --> 01:18.036
He can give you two minutes.
You gave him the last 20 years.

01:20.122 --> 01:21.999
-Hors d'oeuvres?
-No, thank you.

01:22.082 --> 01:25.169
Good girl. Stay hungry.
Stay focused. There he is.

01:25.252 --> 01:26.336
Hey.

01:28.046 --> 01:30.757
You gotta meet the newest horse
in the Stahl/Grunner stable.

01:30.841 --> 01:32.176
And a filly at that.

01:34.928 --> 01:36.680
Keep it up. You need him.

01:36.763 --> 01:39.725
Delighted to introduce you
to some of your compatriots.

01:39.808 --> 01:40.851
We got Ronald Becker

01:40.934 --> 01:44.354
with the blockbuster real estate course,
50 Days to Financial Freedom,

01:44.438 --> 01:46.273
Rocco St. Vincent with Back Pain No More,

01:46.356 --> 01:49.109
and Sandy Pitosky, who's a double threat,

01:49.193 --> 01:52.446
with Gardening Made Simple
and Food Dehydration For Beginners.

01:53.363 --> 01:54.990
God, I thought women were boring.

01:55.073 --> 01:59.745
Gentlemen, allow me to present
the titular body behind Body By Sheila,

01:59.828 --> 02:02.039
-Sheila Rubin.
-Nice to meet you all.

02:02.122 --> 02:05.542
That is a dynamite-looking outfit
you got there.

02:05.626 --> 02:06.668
What's that color?

02:06.752 --> 02:08.961
-Rubber ducky?
-Yellow.

02:09.045 --> 02:12.799
Auggie, well, I'd love to find a time
to bend your ear about

02:12.883 --> 02:15.427
-the marketing campaign for the launch.
-Auggie!

02:15.511 --> 02:18.180
-Great. Yeah, we'll set a time for that.
-Auggie!

02:18.263 --> 02:20.807
Hey, Robbie-boy. Hey.

02:20.891 --> 02:21.892
Enjoy.

02:23.018 --> 02:24.686
Auggie's in acquisitions.

02:24.770 --> 02:27.773
Once he has you on the hook,
it's on to the next big fish.

02:30.442 --> 02:31.568
Food dehydration?

02:32.319 --> 02:36.114
Yeah. I sold 20,000 units
in Q3 of last year, so…

02:36.615 --> 02:38.659
Don't knock it till you dried it.

02:41.703 --> 02:43.330
-Let's go.
-Two more questions for you.

02:43.413 --> 02:47.209
What are you up to next Tuesday?
And do you like steak tartare?

02:48.669 --> 02:50.254
No. Thank you.

02:50.754 --> 02:53.465
Stay lean. Eyes on the prize.

02:53.549 --> 02:54.550
We're not there yet.

03:08.188 --> 03:11.692
I know it wasn't the most exciting way
for you to spend the evening, but--

03:11.775 --> 03:16.613
Yeah, well, that is putting it mildly
because that was a world-class bummer.

03:17.114 --> 03:20.617
I thought I'd met some ignorant,
tedious folks in my day,

03:20.701 --> 03:24.121
but it turns out
I hadn't even scratched the surface.

03:24.204 --> 03:26.039
Well, it wasn't easy for me
all those years,

03:26.123 --> 03:28.458
-going to your academic events.
-Yeah.

03:28.542 --> 03:30.169
But I did it for you.

03:30.252 --> 03:32.838
Yeah. And I appreciated it.

03:32.921 --> 03:33.922
Right? Didn't I?

03:34.006 --> 03:35.549
He doesn't need an answer to that.

03:39.636 --> 03:41.847
I was talking to one of 'em,
trying to make conversation,

03:41.930 --> 03:44.433
and she says to me,
"I used to be a Democrat."

03:44.516 --> 03:46.351
And I said, "Yeah? What happened?"

03:47.436 --> 03:51.148
And she just shrugged.
Just shrugged and laughed.

03:51.231 --> 03:54.151
Like it's a fucking joke
that she just gave up

03:54.234 --> 03:56.778
and decided to just float
with the current.

03:58.447 --> 04:02.951
Like it's funny that we have a actor,
an impostor, as a president.

04:03.035 --> 04:04.328
Not yet.

04:04.411 --> 04:08.123
You know, people thought
Idi Amin was a joke,

04:08.207 --> 04:10.000
till he started shooting people
in the street.

04:10.083 --> 04:12.628
And then guess what?
Surprise, surprise. Not that funny.

04:12.711 --> 04:14.087
It's just a little longer.

04:14.171 --> 04:17.089
Not that I expected that they would know
what's going on in Uganda.

04:17.591 --> 04:19.426
They don't know what's going on
in their own backyard.

04:19.510 --> 04:21.512
-Deregulation by the oil industry…
-You're close.

04:21.595 --> 04:23.931
-Just a little longer.
-…drilling, drought, devastation.

04:24.014 --> 04:26.016
The likes of which
their tiny little brains

04:26.099 --> 04:27.601
couldn't even begin to contemplate.

04:27.684 --> 04:29.144
When you're on solid ground…

04:29.228 --> 04:31.605
Absolutely un-fucking-real.

04:32.856 --> 04:35.067
-Jesus. Jesus!
-Shit.

04:35.150 --> 04:37.319
-Watch the road.
-Really? What are you doing?

04:37.402 --> 04:39.863
-We hit a bump. I'm sorry.
-No, you're not.

04:39.947 --> 04:42.282
-Easy. Easy.
-Yes, I am, all right?

04:42.366 --> 04:44.117
I am very tense right now.

04:44.201 --> 04:45.786
That party wasn't easy for me.

04:45.869 --> 04:48.830
I'm still processing
the loss of the election.

04:48.914 --> 04:52.042
And to show up and find out
that the community has turned its back--

04:52.125 --> 04:54.253
not on me, 'cause it's not about me,

04:54.336 --> 04:57.965
but turned its back on
the values that I stand for.

04:58.757 --> 05:01.260
It's painful. That's what it is.

05:02.010 --> 05:03.220
It's very painful.

05:03.303 --> 05:04.304
I hate you!

05:05.639 --> 05:06.640
I hate you!

05:08.851 --> 05:12.062
-Excuse me?
-I hate you, like, so much right now

05:12.145 --> 05:14.606
with my whole self. I--

05:15.941 --> 05:18.193
I just-- I hate your guts.

05:22.865 --> 05:25.909
All right. I don't know
if you're trying to be funny--

05:25.993 --> 05:28.120
-I'm not.
-Okay.

05:28.203 --> 05:31.748
I'm so sick of your shit.

05:39.590 --> 05:41.008
You're in a mood. I get it.

05:42.176 --> 05:45.179
No, you don't get it.
You don't get it at all.

05:51.435 --> 05:52.769
Yep. I don't get it.

05:57.649 --> 05:59.943
Hello? Are you coming?

06:03.155 --> 06:04.156
No.

06:06.575 --> 06:08.952
Sheila, the babysitter's up there,
all right?

06:09.036 --> 06:12.039
I don't really know how to talk to her,
and I've had some drinks.

06:12.122 --> 06:15.334
We both said some things.
Let's just go to bed.

06:15.417 --> 06:17.878
We'll talk about it in the morning,
all right? Come on.

06:19.213 --> 06:20.631
Sheila, let's go.

06:21.298 --> 06:22.633
There you go.

06:22.716 --> 06:24.259
No. Sheila.

06:25.511 --> 06:26.887
Sheila, get out of the limo.

06:26.970 --> 06:29.806
-Driver, you can go. Thank you.
-No. No.

06:29.890 --> 06:31.808
Hello. Hello!

06:33.936 --> 06:37.105
All right. Where the fuck do you go now?

06:38.941 --> 06:40.067
Fucking great.

06:43.320 --> 06:46.114
One simple phone call
can be your first step

06:46.198 --> 06:48.659
on a journey to a whole new you.

06:48.742 --> 06:52.120
The Meal-a-Wheel system is so easy,
even I can do it.

06:52.204 --> 06:55.499
All you do is spin to get thin.

06:56.083 --> 06:57.709
And to keep things even simpler,

06:57.793 --> 07:01.713
you can order my new cookbook,
Gettin' Lean With Vincent Green.

07:02.464 --> 07:07.010
All my recipes are carefully designed
to be nutritious, delicious,

07:07.094 --> 07:08.971
and best of all, they're easy.

07:09.513 --> 07:10.722
Just like me.

07:11.515 --> 07:16.770
And if you call now,
we'll throw in, at no additional charge,

07:16.854 --> 07:19.898
a month's supply of Vinnie's Greens.

07:19.982 --> 07:24.361
That's right. My all-new,
all-natural multivitamin supplement.

07:24.444 --> 07:28.031
These little miracle pills give you
all the nutritional support you need

07:28.115 --> 07:29.700
to stay lean and healthy.

07:30.284 --> 07:34.830
Won't you join me and take control
of your body and your life?

07:34.913 --> 07:38.000
All you have to do is make the call today.

07:40.627 --> 07:42.921
Hey, are you awake? Sorry.

07:44.923 --> 07:47.634
I didn't know if you were up or not.
Are you up?

07:47.718 --> 07:50.179
Yes. Now you are.

07:50.262 --> 07:51.889
And I made you some coffee.

07:54.057 --> 07:58.562
Actually, it made itself. It's on a timer.

07:59.855 --> 08:01.273
Ernie and his gadgets.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.194
Well, anyway, I thought we could talk.

08:05.277 --> 08:08.280
If you are ready, and if not,
it's totally okay too.

08:08.363 --> 08:10.032
Just-- Are you okay?

08:10.115 --> 08:12.618
Because when you got here last night,
you didn't seem okay.

08:12.701 --> 08:14.453
But I don't wanna pry. So--

08:14.536 --> 08:17.164
No. Thank you for the coffee.

08:17.247 --> 08:20.167
And thank you for letting me stay
here in your guesthouse.

08:20.250 --> 08:22.669
I just needed some time to myself.

08:22.753 --> 08:26.381
Yeah, of course. It's no bother at all.
It's actually a total pleasure.

08:26.465 --> 08:28.467
So, it's yours as long as you need it.

08:28.550 --> 08:31.094
And it's none of my business. So--

08:31.762 --> 08:33.304
But I'm here if you need to talk,

08:33.388 --> 08:36.265
and I promise I won't say anything
and I will just listen.

08:36.350 --> 08:37.808
I just needed some--

08:37.893 --> 08:39.602
-Space.
-Time.

08:39.686 --> 08:43.857
-You know, to think about my life.
-Marriage, with Danny.

08:43.941 --> 08:46.985
Yep, Sheil, we've been waiting for this
ever since the election.

08:47.069 --> 08:48.612
And it has been so hard watching you

08:48.695 --> 08:51.532
and knowing that you are so unhappy,
and feeling so trapped, and--

08:51.615 --> 08:52.824
No, shush.

08:56.161 --> 08:58.872
It's just that now is like
the perfect time to leave him, you know?

08:58.956 --> 09:02.125
And I know, I know,
"Greta, it's never the perfect time,"

09:02.209 --> 09:04.336
with Maya and all that stuff, but--

09:04.419 --> 09:07.089
Come on, you are getting out there
professionally, and--

09:07.172 --> 09:08.590
I'm not ready to leave him yet.

09:09.258 --> 09:13.095
I will, soon. But not yet.

09:13.595 --> 09:15.430
Yeah, of course. I'm sorry.

09:17.015 --> 09:20.060
Right. But if you need a lawyer,
Ernie knows like a half a dozen.

09:20.143 --> 09:22.521
And one of them's a lady.
And she's a total dragon.

09:22.604 --> 09:27.734
So whenever you are ready, I'm here.
Co-captain of the SS Divorce.

09:28.861 --> 09:30.863
You know,
what I really need is a ride home.

09:30.946 --> 09:33.115
And maybe some Sweet'N Low?

09:33.198 --> 09:35.409
Oh, my gosh, yeah. Totally not a problem.

09:36.743 --> 09:38.704
And you know what?

09:39.329 --> 09:41.331
You look so freaking cute
in my college shirt.

09:41.415 --> 09:43.542
-You should keep it. I'm giving it to you.
-Thank you. It's cozy.

09:43.625 --> 09:45.460
It's yours. I love you.

09:47.212 --> 09:49.548
-No, I-- I don't mean it like--
-I know. I know.

09:49.631 --> 09:52.551
Yeah, I just believe in you.
Like, I really do.

09:53.635 --> 09:57.139
And… I'm gonna get you some Sweet'N Low.

09:57.222 --> 10:00.684
-Thank you.
-So, just-- You relax. Okay.

10:04.563 --> 10:07.232
It wasn't the plan, but here we are.

10:07.941 --> 10:10.444
You opened the door.
Now we walk through it.

10:10.986 --> 10:14.031
We tell him what we want, what we need.

10:14.114 --> 10:17.201
We don't back down, for once. We say it.

10:18.243 --> 10:19.244
Goddamn.

10:20.996 --> 10:22.497
-Shit. Hey.
-Hi.

10:22.581 --> 10:24.791
Hi, Mama. We're having breakfast.

10:24.875 --> 10:26.543
Sweetie, you're up early.

10:26.627 --> 10:28.212
Daddy made pancake.

10:28.295 --> 10:32.591
Yeah, and Mommy is back from her meeting.

10:33.091 --> 10:34.134
Wow.

10:34.218 --> 10:36.386
They're so good. Have one.

10:36.470 --> 10:38.305
I will in a second, sweetie.

10:39.348 --> 10:41.099
Just need to have a quick talk with Daddy.

10:41.183 --> 10:42.184
Okay.

10:42.267 --> 10:46.104
Yeah, did you want coffee first?
I put a pot on.

10:46.188 --> 10:47.564
I need to talk to you.

10:48.524 --> 10:49.566
Okay.

10:49.650 --> 10:51.818
Say it. How you feel, what you need.

10:51.902 --> 10:54.071
I didn't mean to blurt
all those things out last night.

10:54.154 --> 10:56.073
-Don't apologize.
-I wasn't going to.

10:56.156 --> 10:58.242
But we need to find a time
to sit down and--

10:58.325 --> 11:00.827
You don't need to because
you were right to say those things.

11:00.911 --> 11:03.080
I heard you. And I hear you.

11:03.789 --> 11:05.999
-But I haven't even told you what--
-You need to see a change in me.

11:06.083 --> 11:08.919
And that's exactly what you're going
to see 'cause, babe…

11:10.712 --> 11:12.130
I've been a jerk.

11:12.214 --> 11:13.674
Why? 'Cause I was allowed to be.

11:13.757 --> 11:18.053
By a cruel and unfair
male chauvinist system

11:18.136 --> 11:20.514
that, yes, I actively participated in.

11:20.597 --> 11:23.600
But that stops now.
Starting today, I'm gonna do my part.

11:23.684 --> 11:25.853
I'm gonna pick up the slack for my gender.

11:25.936 --> 11:29.106
Whatever it takes. The cooking,
the cleaning, Maya's school shit.

11:30.399 --> 11:31.400
I'm setting you free.

11:31.483 --> 11:34.194
I want you to go out there,
and I want you to promote your film.

11:34.278 --> 11:36.071
-It's a videotape.
-Whatever it is.

11:37.322 --> 11:40.409
It's your turn to be the breadwinner.
It's my turn to slice it up and toast it.

11:40.492 --> 11:42.536
But I don't want you
to take my word for it, okay?

11:42.619 --> 11:44.496
I'm gonna prove it to you.
I wanna walk the walk.

11:44.580 --> 11:46.498
And I'm gonna show you that I can change.

11:47.541 --> 11:48.876
If you just give me a chance.

11:49.751 --> 11:51.587
You've got to. Can you do that?

11:51.670 --> 11:54.798
Can you just give me a chance
to show you that I can change,

11:54.882 --> 11:57.926
-and I can grow, and I can evolve, please?
-I--

11:58.010 --> 12:01.096
Unless, of course,
there's someone else, then--

12:01.180 --> 12:02.973
Is it? Is it someone else?

12:04.600 --> 12:05.809
No. I…

12:11.231 --> 12:12.482
-Okay.
-Okay?

12:14.401 --> 12:17.112
Babe. Babe.

12:18.322 --> 12:19.573
Shit.

12:23.452 --> 12:24.453
Thank you, dear.

12:26.663 --> 12:27.748
Two more.

12:30.083 --> 12:31.835
I think it's time for a break.

12:31.919 --> 12:33.754
It's gotta be enough blankets.

12:34.296 --> 12:36.757
Still need to check the expiration
on the canned goods.

12:37.508 --> 12:38.592
And test the gas masks.

12:38.675 --> 12:40.511
But you must be exhausted.
I can handle this.

12:41.011 --> 12:43.388
That would be good for me. For us.

12:43.472 --> 12:45.057
But can you stop soon, too?

12:45.140 --> 12:47.100
I know you wanna be ready for the baby--

12:47.184 --> 12:48.185
Not just the baby.

12:49.061 --> 12:51.980
For whatever the heavenly father
and his wisdom has in store.

12:52.898 --> 12:55.275
I-- I'm worried about you.

12:55.359 --> 12:57.027
You've been working so hard.

12:57.110 --> 12:59.905
Doing double duty at work
and then with the church.

12:59.988 --> 13:01.698
I don't mind being of service.

13:02.282 --> 13:05.160
I just wanna make sure
that it's not too much for you,

13:05.744 --> 13:07.454
that you don't have something to prove.

13:08.539 --> 13:09.748
Certainly not to me.

13:12.292 --> 13:15.295
Why don't you head up to the kitchen?
Have some lemonade.

13:15.379 --> 13:16.880
I'll be with you when I'm ready.

13:18.674 --> 13:19.758
Of course.

13:29.601 --> 13:32.062
Bend the knees…

13:32.145 --> 13:36.066
Shoulders back, smile.
Give 'em some tits and teeth.

13:36.149 --> 13:38.986
We're up against cheese cubes.
This shouldn't be too tough.

13:39.736 --> 13:40.571
Hi!

13:41.446 --> 13:43.782
That's me. I'm her.

13:44.700 --> 13:47.035
Are you interested
in hearing more about the tape?

13:47.119 --> 13:48.245
No? Okay.

13:48.328 --> 13:51.498
So we take it down a few clicks.
We don't wanna scare people.

13:51.582 --> 13:53.584
Hi, are you interested in fitness?

13:54.835 --> 13:57.754
Nope, just cheese. Good to know.

13:58.714 --> 14:01.717
Hey, Kevin. It's Kevin, right?

14:02.509 --> 14:03.927
Kev, whatev.

14:04.011 --> 14:08.182
Kev, would you mind telling me
what that device you're holding is about?

14:08.932 --> 14:10.934
I guess it keeps track of engagement.

14:11.018 --> 14:12.144
Like stops and buys.

14:12.227 --> 14:14.646
And how much engagement
am I expected to have?

14:14.730 --> 14:16.315
Dad just told me to count.

14:16.398 --> 14:19.359
Dad? So Auggie is your dad?

14:19.443 --> 14:20.819
I wanted a desk job, at first.

14:20.903 --> 14:24.323
But he said it would be good
to just get out there.

14:24.406 --> 14:26.575
Great. You're officially on the B-team.

14:26.658 --> 14:29.244
If I buy this, will I look like you?

14:34.499 --> 14:37.586
Well, I don't know. Do you want to?
Do you wanna look like me?

14:37.669 --> 14:40.464
No, I mean-- I was joking.

14:40.547 --> 14:43.217
Are you sure?
Because men can use aerobic exercise too.

14:43.717 --> 14:46.553
And in the privacy of your own home,

14:46.637 --> 14:50.516
on your VCR,
you can do or be whatever you want.

14:51.099 --> 14:52.392
What about you?

14:52.476 --> 14:54.186
Do you wanna get fit?
Or maybe your wife does?

14:54.269 --> 14:56.230
-I don't have a wife.
-Well, not yet.

14:56.313 --> 14:58.357
Why don't you take this home
and give it a try?

14:58.440 --> 15:01.235
I promise you,
you will see results within weeks.

15:01.318 --> 15:05.572
It's a heart-pumping workout for 9.95,
and it is a lot of fun.

15:05.656 --> 15:07.449
Yeah, no, sure, here you go.

15:08.325 --> 15:09.326
Thank you.

15:22.881 --> 15:23.882
Okay.

15:25.425 --> 15:28.262
Here we go. Going to school.

15:35.435 --> 15:36.520
All right.

15:41.733 --> 15:42.860
Look at that.

15:43.527 --> 15:44.611
Tire swing.

15:45.737 --> 15:46.947
Perfect playground toy.

15:48.073 --> 15:50.617
Can't improve on it
because it's already perfect.

15:50.701 --> 15:55.956
Simple, pure, circular, eternal.

15:58.458 --> 16:01.461
And cubbies, come on.

16:01.545 --> 16:05.090
Why don't adults have these?
You know, little space to call your own.

16:05.174 --> 16:06.717
Makes perfect sense to me.

16:06.800 --> 16:08.594
Hey. Would you like some pumpkin bread?

16:09.553 --> 16:11.138
Are you kidding? Yeah, I'd love some.

16:11.221 --> 16:13.307
-I made it fresh this morning.
-This morning?

16:18.937 --> 16:22.399
That's not pumpkin bread.
That is a slice of heaven.

16:22.482 --> 16:24.276
-I'm gonna need that recipe.
-Sure.

16:24.943 --> 16:26.778
So, what? Daddy's day off work?

16:26.862 --> 16:29.573
Well, a little more than just a day.

16:29.656 --> 16:32.492
Sorta taking over on the home front
while the wife heads to work,

16:32.576 --> 16:35.621
and I'm loving it. Yeah.

16:35.704 --> 16:37.164
Get a little more time with Maya.

16:37.247 --> 16:40.042
Such a special kid.
She said the funniest thing this morning.

16:40.125 --> 16:42.169
Hey, Greta, get in here.
You wanna hear this.

16:42.252 --> 16:43.795
I was saying Maya was funny this morning.

16:43.879 --> 16:45.797
Yeah, all kids are funny to their parents.

16:45.881 --> 16:47.424
Maybe not so much to everybody else.

16:49.718 --> 16:51.637
Did I do something to you, Greta?

16:51.720 --> 16:53.096
To me? No.

16:53.180 --> 16:58.894
Look, I'm new to the game, obviously,
but I am ready to listen and learn.

16:58.977 --> 17:01.897
You know what? You should sign up
for the outreach committee with me.

17:01.980 --> 17:03.690
It's a lot of work and nobody notices.

17:03.774 --> 17:05.817
Unless you mess up,
and then they really come for you.

17:05.901 --> 17:06.984
Right, Wanda?

17:07.069 --> 17:08.487
-Yeah.
-Were you going to get coffee?

17:08.569 --> 17:11.365
-Were you going, or--
-Was I g-- Sure.

17:11.448 --> 17:13.242
That's amazing. Thank you.

17:13.325 --> 17:14.492
-Thank you so much.
-Yeah.

17:15.743 --> 17:18.539
So, you want me to sign you up?
The meetings are twice a week.

17:19.580 --> 17:21.083
-Did you say twice?
-You all right?

17:21.165 --> 17:23.627
-Twice a week?
-Yes. Two times.

17:25.087 --> 17:29.174
Great, yeah. That sounds fun.

17:30.008 --> 17:31.009
Sign me up.

17:32.511 --> 17:34.388
-Thank you. Bye.
-Enjoy.

17:35.305 --> 17:36.348
So, I guess that's lunch?

17:37.349 --> 17:39.101
I don't mind keeping going.

17:39.184 --> 17:42.437
Till noon, say?
Foot traffic is still strong.

17:42.521 --> 17:44.314
We eat lunch at noon, not before.

17:44.398 --> 17:45.816
It's just I'm kinda hungry though.

17:45.899 --> 17:48.861
And I saw a Chinese place
across the street that looked all right.

17:48.944 --> 17:49.945
You wanna check it out?

17:50.028 --> 17:51.530
We've just had the peach and the yogurt,

17:51.613 --> 17:53.365
-so there's no lunch. Not yet.
-No.

17:53.448 --> 17:55.284
Or I can pick you up
something to go if you want?

17:55.367 --> 17:57.202
A tsunami of salt and fat
to curdle inside you

17:57.286 --> 17:59.580
-for the rest of the day?
-No, thank you, but you enjoy.

17:59.663 --> 18:00.581
Okay.

18:01.248 --> 18:03.834
And maybe you could take a break too.
I mean, you earned it.

18:03.917 --> 18:06.962
-Says the lazy boss's son.
-Yep, will do.

18:07.045 --> 18:08.797
That's it. Keep it up girls.

18:08.881 --> 18:12.634
Boys too. Pump those arms. Pump them.

18:12.718 --> 18:15.012
You gotta move it
if you wanna fucking groove it.

18:16.138 --> 18:17.848
Shit. We can bleep that, right, babe?

18:18.432 --> 18:21.143
Yep, no doubt. Keep on rolling.

18:23.020 --> 18:25.772
Keep that side-to-side motion going.

18:25.856 --> 18:27.149
That's where it's at.

18:27.232 --> 18:28.650
You feel that energy?

18:28.734 --> 18:32.154
That long line from the wheels
to the crown, baby.

18:32.237 --> 18:34.990
That's the Roller BOD magic.

18:35.574 --> 18:39.661
It's a full-body workout.
No harsh bumping and jumping here.

18:39.745 --> 18:42.956
This right here is the steady groove.
You got it!

18:43.457 --> 18:45.042
Let's get ready for crossovers.

18:45.125 --> 18:48.795
This is an advanced move,
so just join me when you're ready.

18:48.879 --> 18:50.631
No rushing here.

18:50.714 --> 18:55.344
In four, three, two, and one!

18:58.639 --> 19:01.391
Shit, babe. Are you okay?

19:06.188 --> 19:07.189
Dude.

19:09.107 --> 19:11.527
Dude. I'm cool.

19:12.528 --> 19:15.239
I'm just gonna have to have a soft ten.
Gotta re-rig.

19:17.074 --> 19:19.326
It's not working.
I still fucking hate her.

19:19.409 --> 19:22.704
I hate her. I hate her for stealing
from me and getting us evicted.

19:22.788 --> 19:23.789
Hey. Hey. Hey, hey.

19:23.872 --> 19:26.834
Bun, hey. What do we say
about that anger of yours?

19:26.917 --> 19:30.003
That I should use it
to go burn her house down.

19:31.380 --> 19:32.548
Kidding.

19:34.508 --> 19:35.884
That it's bad vibes.

19:35.968 --> 19:37.636
Super bad vibes!

19:37.719 --> 19:40.681
It's hard, though, to believe again.

19:40.764 --> 19:44.351
I had my dream,
and she fucking snatched it.

19:44.935 --> 19:46.645
And now you have a radder one.

19:47.312 --> 19:48.814
What if this one isn't radder?

19:49.815 --> 19:52.025
It is, and it's ours.

19:53.735 --> 19:55.487
So why don't you get me the duct tape?

19:55.571 --> 19:57.573
I'll have this rigged up
and rolling in ten, babe.

20:02.369 --> 20:04.621
Oh, man, this thing is
way worse than I thought.

20:05.497 --> 20:07.332
I don't know, won't I sweat?

20:07.416 --> 20:09.835
Yes, but it feels good. It's a release.

20:09.918 --> 20:11.295
Won't I get big muscles?

20:11.378 --> 20:12.629
Not necessarily.

20:12.713 --> 20:14.548
My husband doesn't
want me getting big muscles.

20:14.631 --> 20:16.466
-I don't have big muscles.
-I don't think.

20:16.550 --> 20:17.634
But I do have muscle tone.

20:17.718 --> 20:19.261
Do you know where the setting powder is?

20:19.344 --> 20:20.429
I do not.

20:23.265 --> 20:24.725
-Is it for kids?
-It's for you.

20:24.808 --> 20:26.435
I don't have time for me anymore.

20:26.518 --> 20:28.562
Well, that's the beauty
of working out at home,

20:28.645 --> 20:30.689
is that you can do it
while the kids are napping.

20:30.772 --> 20:32.482
That's when I clean the house.

20:32.566 --> 20:34.568
But when do you make time for your needs?

20:34.651 --> 20:36.486
-I do everything.
-Your body.

20:36.570 --> 20:39.364
-Now I'm supposed to work out too?
-I find it invigorating.

20:39.448 --> 20:42.784
I feel so much better afterwards,
like I could conquer the world.

20:42.868 --> 20:44.286
I'm just trying to get through my day.

20:45.829 --> 20:47.998
Three, four…

20:48.081 --> 20:51.418
Four, three, two, one. Take it…

20:51.502 --> 20:53.879
When Sheila and I met,
she was the ambitious one.

20:53.962 --> 20:56.757
She was the one with all the hopes
and dreams for the future.

20:57.508 --> 20:58.634
Then came the compromise.

20:58.717 --> 21:01.637
First, she moves here for my job,
then the baby.

21:01.720 --> 21:06.725
She's enrolled and dropped out of
three different graduate programs for me.

21:07.643 --> 21:12.814
You know, for all my years of talking
about wage theft and workers' rights--

21:12.898 --> 21:15.317
you know, studying Che and Chávez.

21:15.400 --> 21:18.111
What about women?

21:18.195 --> 21:20.489
What about their sweat
and their sacrifice?

21:20.572 --> 21:25.744
Are they not entitled to pursue
a little bit of the elusive American dream

21:25.827 --> 21:26.828
like you and I?

21:27.454 --> 21:33.085
Well, Jerry, that's not possible
unless men, like you and I, step it up.

21:33.836 --> 21:37.214
Lift the yoke of domestic slavery
from their necks.

21:38.215 --> 21:39.883
And that's just what I intend to do.

21:46.640 --> 21:47.683
So that's the speech?

21:47.766 --> 21:49.852
-I mean, yes. It's not a speech.
-Okay.

21:49.935 --> 21:51.395
-I'm just--
-Gotcha.

21:59.528 --> 22:00.988
So, I have a question for ya.

22:03.907 --> 22:05.826
-Is this bullshit?
-What?

22:05.909 --> 22:07.995
-All these ideas we've been cooking up…
-What are you doing?

22:08.078 --> 22:10.956
-Jerry, stop.
-…for the past few months.

22:11.039 --> 22:13.917
Do you actually care about any of this?

22:14.001 --> 22:15.711
That's more than one question, okay?

22:15.794 --> 22:17.462
You know what I'm asking you, buddy.

22:18.338 --> 22:22.801
Is our think tank real,
or is it just some sorta consolation prize

22:22.885 --> 22:25.179
for your wounded ego
after losing the election?

22:25.262 --> 22:27.264
Okay, yes, it's real.

22:28.098 --> 22:31.226
-But so is my family.
-There it is, there it is.

22:31.310 --> 22:33.061
And my marriage, okay?

22:33.145 --> 22:34.146
Marriage?

22:34.229 --> 22:38.025
To the woman who abandoned you
on election night.

22:39.318 --> 22:41.862
-She has her difficulties, yeah.
-Yeah.

22:41.945 --> 22:44.573
And sometimes, she needs her space,
but she always comes back.

22:46.366 --> 22:47.534
So far, at least.

22:48.035 --> 22:51.914
But who knows where this
Jazzercise highway is gonna take her?

22:51.997 --> 22:55.042
Maybe next time she pulls a runner,
it'll be for good.

22:55.125 --> 22:57.503
Jerry, with all due respect,

22:57.586 --> 23:01.089
I'm not exactly coming to you
for advice on long-term relationships.

23:02.216 --> 23:04.593
That's hurtful, but fair.

23:04.676 --> 23:05.886
-It's the truth.
-Yeah.

23:05.969 --> 23:08.096
Jerry, fuck, man. Look, hey, stop.

23:08.180 --> 23:09.181
-Stop.
-These are mine.

23:09.264 --> 23:11.600
I'm not talking about walking away
from our goals here.

23:11.683 --> 23:12.684
Yes, you are.

23:12.768 --> 23:15.020
I'm talking about spending more time
with my kid.

23:15.521 --> 23:17.564
Having a more flexible schedule, okay?

23:17.648 --> 23:20.943
You and I,
we can still accomplish anything.

23:21.026 --> 23:23.237
I could've taken off too,
but I stuck around.

23:23.862 --> 23:25.030
I kept believing in you.

23:25.113 --> 23:27.491
Really?
Did you have a lot of options, Jerry?

23:27.574 --> 23:28.700
Shit.

23:28.784 --> 23:32.329
Were there a lot of people out there
inviting you to come over

23:32.412 --> 23:36.500
and-- and park your van in their driveway
for an indefinite period of time?

23:36.583 --> 23:38.252
I had options, okay?

23:38.335 --> 23:43.715
Back home,
I had one very real and serious option.

23:45.050 --> 23:46.718
Shit, man, I don't want to fight with you.

23:47.386 --> 23:52.057
I also don't wanna see you give up,
sell out, compromise--

23:52.140 --> 23:54.351
Don't ask me to choose
between you and my family.

23:55.853 --> 23:58.188
Okay. No, I hear ya.

23:59.857 --> 24:01.733
Loud and motherfucking clear.

24:04.403 --> 24:06.780
Look, I'm not saying
that I know more than you, man.

24:06.864 --> 24:10.117
I'm just saying
women are fucking mysterious.

24:10.701 --> 24:13.203
All of 'em. Not just her.

24:13.871 --> 24:14.872
All of 'em.

24:17.791 --> 24:19.293
Take care, brother.

24:26.258 --> 24:29.928
Couple caveats. Color and sound are rough.
Edits are crude as hell.

24:30.012 --> 24:31.388
Just show me the fucking footage.

24:31.471 --> 24:34.391
But when all's said and done,
you're gonna be like, "Sheila who?"

24:34.474 --> 24:36.810
And, "That name doesn't ring
a single fucking bell.

24:36.894 --> 24:38.687
Did I, like, go to school with her, or--"

24:38.770 --> 24:40.772
-Can you just play the tape?
-Okay.

24:40.856 --> 24:44.735
And hurry up. I'm, like, dying here.
This couch is, like, filled with sand.

24:44.818 --> 24:47.529
Dude, I keep telling dudes,
"You gotta use the outdoor shower."

24:48.572 --> 24:49.656
It's a hose.

24:49.740 --> 24:51.950
It's got a spray setting. You ready?

24:52.951 --> 24:56.079
Here we go.

24:57.456 --> 24:59.958
Keep that side-to-side motion going.

25:00.042 --> 25:01.502
-That's where it's at.
-Howdy.

25:01.585 --> 25:03.420
-You feel that energy?
-Oh, my God.

25:03.504 --> 25:05.631
-That long line from the wheels…
-You look so good, babe.

25:10.385 --> 25:11.386
Oh, no.

25:16.350 --> 25:18.268
Cakes! Turk! Pablo!

25:18.352 --> 25:21.021
Which one of you douche knuckles
fucked with our tape?

25:22.147 --> 25:23.315
Sup?

25:24.316 --> 25:26.485
What happened to our tape, dude?

25:28.820 --> 25:31.657
No idea. I'm a vinyl guy.

25:31.740 --> 25:34.201
Yo, have you seen the lice shampoo?

25:34.284 --> 25:35.327
Oh, my God.

25:35.410 --> 25:37.454
Yeah, we all got lice and crabs again.

25:38.413 --> 25:41.416
Fuck! Fuck!

25:46.755 --> 25:47.881
Bro.

25:49.424 --> 25:50.425
Dude.

25:55.264 --> 25:56.765
-Yep. Yep.
-I don't know. Okay.

26:01.812 --> 26:02.855
Not bad.

26:04.523 --> 26:06.024
-I told you you'd love it.
-Come on.

26:06.108 --> 26:08.652
-You're not gonna have one piece of sushi?
-Come on, why not?

26:08.735 --> 26:11.697
Because I'm not a fucking dolphin, mainly.

26:11.780 --> 26:13.699
Sorry, sweetie. I mean, do what you want.

26:13.782 --> 26:16.034
Obviously you don't need my permission.

26:16.118 --> 26:18.203
Thank you. I plan to.

26:20.873 --> 26:23.750
Hey, it was really nice
of you guys to still come.

26:24.543 --> 26:25.544
Still?

26:26.211 --> 26:27.337
No. We just--

26:27.838 --> 26:30.382
We made these plans a long time ago
before you--

26:31.049 --> 26:34.720
It's just so nice to all be together.
That's all.

26:34.803 --> 26:36.180
-Yes.
-Yeah.

26:36.263 --> 26:37.472
Right.

26:39.600 --> 26:42.060
So, tell us about this tape of yours,
Sheila.

26:42.144 --> 26:45.105
Sounds like this production outfit
you're with--

26:45.606 --> 26:46.607
Stahl/Grunner.

26:46.690 --> 26:50.694
Yes. Sounds like they have you
out there making the rounds.

26:50.777 --> 26:55.490
Yes, I didn't realize how much of
the sales aspect would be on… me.

26:55.574 --> 26:57.618
It's all sales, whatever you're doing.

26:57.701 --> 27:00.370
Polyurethane compounds. Fitness.

27:01.246 --> 27:02.247
Politics.

27:03.165 --> 27:05.125
Well, I don't really see it like that.
I mean--

27:05.209 --> 27:07.961
I mean, if they got resources behind you,
which they do,

27:08.045 --> 27:09.755
I mean, it means that
they have confidence.

27:09.838 --> 27:11.340
Yeah. They know a good thing
when they see it.

27:11.423 --> 27:12.466
Yeah.

27:12.549 --> 27:15.010
I think they're being a little general
in their approach.

27:15.761 --> 27:18.722
I mean, they sent me to all these places
that women are, but--

27:19.389 --> 27:21.517
I mean, the grocery store, the salon--

27:21.600 --> 27:24.228
-It's where women get their chores done.
-Right.

27:24.311 --> 27:26.271
They're not in the mood to shop.

27:26.355 --> 27:28.315
Honestly, that's the genius of the mall.

27:28.815 --> 27:31.443
It makes shopping feel like a luxury.

27:31.527 --> 27:34.112
Instead of one more thing
you have to check off your list.

27:37.157 --> 27:38.617
That's just an observation.

27:38.700 --> 27:39.952
Well, it's a good one, right?

27:40.035 --> 27:41.245
-Yeah.
-Right.

27:41.328 --> 27:43.622
People pay Harvard consultants
for a lot less.

27:45.916 --> 27:47.751
Now, what about you, Danny?

27:47.835 --> 27:51.004
How's this all going for you?
Got any extra help at home?

27:51.088 --> 27:52.297
Yeah, me.

27:53.090 --> 27:55.384
I am the extra help at home.

27:56.009 --> 27:58.679
And I'm enjoying it.

27:58.762 --> 28:00.931
It's creative and interesting.

28:01.014 --> 28:05.978
And, you know, I think it's about time
that I showed this lady right here

28:06.061 --> 28:11.859
that I can evolve.

28:31.962 --> 28:35.340
Hope everyone saved room for dessert.
Magda made her flan.

28:35.424 --> 28:39.219
-I hope it likes you.
-It's, "I hope you like it."

28:39.887 --> 28:40.888
Lo siento.

28:41.638 --> 28:45.893
Qué rico. I can't wait to enjoy it.

28:45.976 --> 28:47.686
Oh, you still speak very well.

28:48.604 --> 28:52.316
I will never forget how impressed
we all were when you came to Mexico.

28:53.650 --> 28:59.198
This gringo! So fluent, so tall!
The handsome Missionary.

28:59.281 --> 29:03.744
Oh, stop. You're embarrassing me.
That was a long time ago.

29:03.827 --> 29:06.163
We don't wanna bore
the kids with our old stories.

29:06.246 --> 29:08.665
I'm not bored.
We love your stories, Aunt Magda.

29:08.749 --> 29:11.210
You know the one about the
first time your father tried a Tamale--

29:11.293 --> 29:13.545
We speak English in this house.

29:15.464 --> 29:16.465
Sorry.

29:30.437 --> 29:33.190
Okay, folks. I know how you're feeling.

29:34.066 --> 29:37.027
I'm feeling it too.
You're feeling pushed to the limit.

29:38.070 --> 29:39.988
You're ready to give up on yourself.

29:40.072 --> 29:43.867
Well, I'm here to tell you something.
Right here, right now.

29:43.951 --> 29:46.328
You don't need to believe in yourself,
okay?

29:46.411 --> 29:48.497
I'm gonna do that for you.

29:49.456 --> 29:54.336
I'm gonna give you that confidence
and that energy to keep pushing through.

29:54.419 --> 29:55.420
And swing.

29:55.504 --> 29:58.090
Two, three, four.

29:59.174 --> 30:01.969
Put your trust in me. Follow my lead.

30:02.052 --> 30:04.388
Don't look in my eyes. Look in yours.

30:05.347 --> 30:09.393
Find you.
Only you have the power to change you.

30:10.769 --> 30:13.438
It may not be today.
It may not be tomorrow.

30:13.522 --> 30:17.192
But mark my words,
you are gonna feel that change.

30:17.276 --> 30:19.278
You are gonna feel that power.

30:19.778 --> 30:23.740
And you are gonna feel that pride,
knowing that you hung in there.

30:24.241 --> 30:27.452
You stuck it out. You saw it through.

30:27.536 --> 30:30.581
You with me? I can't hear you.

30:30.664 --> 30:33.375
I want you to say it. Are you with me?

30:35.002 --> 30:36.295
Babe.

30:36.378 --> 30:37.379
You like that?

30:38.922 --> 30:40.465
You gotta tell me, okay?

30:41.383 --> 30:44.887
I can't do it better for you
unless you tell me what you like.

30:48.765 --> 30:51.059
That's it. You can do this.

30:52.811 --> 30:53.812
Don't give up yet.

31:10.913 --> 31:15.626
Follow me one more time.

31:16.210 --> 31:18.795
I promise this is it. You can do it.

31:20.964 --> 31:24.301
Just one more time.

31:24.384 --> 31:26.762
And then it's over. And you're done.

31:27.846 --> 31:32.184
In five, four, three, two,

31:32.267 --> 31:35.187
and… here we go.
