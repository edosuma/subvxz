WEBVTT

02:13.391 --> 02:16.028
Um.

02:16.062 --> 02:18.731
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

02:18.765 --> 02:20.432
Uhh...

02:20.465 --> 02:23.736
it's been...

02:23.770 --> 02:25.872
I don't even know,
that's how long it's been.

02:29.041 --> 02:31.510
I don't know if
I'm doing this right, am I...

02:31.543 --> 02:33.880
Am I doing this right?

02:52.698 --> 02:54.366
Um.

02:55.768 --> 02:57.103
Hello?

03:01.741 --> 03:03.810
Yes, my child?

03:03.843 --> 03:06.813
Um, I should
probably start with, uh...

03:06.846 --> 03:08.981
Is that you, Job?

03:09.015 --> 03:10.983
Yes, Father Bentley.

03:11.017 --> 03:12.819
Oh, well this is
a pleasant surprise.

03:12.852 --> 03:14.854
You know, I haven't
seen you since that...

03:14.887 --> 03:16.656
that weird play that I...

03:16.689 --> 03:19.091
Uh, yeah, yeah, I was actually
gonna bring that up here.

03:19.125 --> 03:21.627
Oh, okay.

03:21.661 --> 03:23.763
So, um,

03:23.796 --> 03:27.733
what sins have you
come to confess today?

03:27.767 --> 03:30.870
Pride.

03:30.903 --> 03:33.605
Lust.

03:33.639 --> 03:36.843
Idolatry.

03:36.876 --> 03:39.045
- Being an asshole.
- Eh, language!

03:39.078 --> 03:41.613
Oh, I'm sorry, I...

03:41.647 --> 03:42.849
Ha, I'm just joshing ya.

03:42.882 --> 03:45.550
I really don't give a damn.

03:45.584 --> 03:48.453
All right, so, uh,

03:48.486 --> 03:50.122
let's have at it.

03:50.156 --> 03:51.991
I'm all ears.

03:52.024 --> 03:54.760
Well, we should probably go back
to the first day of school.

03:54.794 --> 03:56.428
I mean, that's going back a bit,

03:56.461 --> 03:58.865
so I might get some
of the details wrong, but...

04:10.710 --> 04:13.545
The first day of school
was fantastic.

04:13.578 --> 04:15.982
- And why is that?
- It was senior year.

04:16.015 --> 04:18.617
I was done with all the tests
and college applications,

04:18.651 --> 04:20.653
and crap like that,
so it would just be a year

04:20.686 --> 04:23.689
of coasting along
and doing whatever I wanted.

04:23.723 --> 04:25.691
I see.

04:25.725 --> 04:28.460
Ah, Maria.

04:28.493 --> 04:29.695
She's a wonderful mom.

04:29.729 --> 04:31.496
That's my mom.

04:31.529 --> 04:32.665
It looks great, Mom.

04:32.698 --> 04:35.835
That's what moms do.

04:35.868 --> 04:37.870
It seems pretty silly now
to actually

04:37.904 --> 04:41.007
be excited to go to school,
but that's how I felt.

04:41.040 --> 04:43.608
- Morning, Father Bentley!
- Morning, Job.

04:43.643 --> 04:45.510
Hey, that's me.

04:45.543 --> 04:47.545
It's Job.

04:47.579 --> 04:50.917
Hey, mailman, keep on, uh,
delivering that mail, man.

04:50.950 --> 04:52.718
That's my job.

04:52.752 --> 04:54.754
- Yo, hold up, is that Job?
- It is!

04:54.787 --> 04:56.789
- Job!
- Job!

05:00.960 --> 05:04.562
Job! Job! Job! Job...

05:11.971 --> 05:13.739
Oh, my God, it's Job!

05:13.773 --> 05:16.208
Oh, my God, dude.

05:16.242 --> 05:18.744
Oh, my God, Job.

05:18.778 --> 05:20.913
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

05:20.947 --> 05:22.682
Yo!

05:37.663 --> 05:39.198
Benjamin, Benjamin,

05:39.231 --> 05:41.734
the man with the plan...

05:41.767 --> 05:43.703
jamin.

05:43.736 --> 05:45.204
- How are you?
- Hi, Job.

05:45.237 --> 05:48.708
- You ready for the day?
- Uh, yeah, let's do it.

05:52.178 --> 05:53.980
This is your agenda for the day.

05:54.013 --> 05:56.682
First class is AP English,
followed by European History.

05:56.716 --> 05:58.784
Sounds good, sounds good.

05:58.818 --> 06:01.020
Lunch is at 12:30
in the cafeteria.

06:01.053 --> 06:03.923
- What do you wanna eat?
- Uhh, I think I'll just

06:03.956 --> 06:05.257
have a little bit
of everything, yeah.

06:08.593 --> 06:10.595
The day could not
have been going better.

06:10.629 --> 06:12.530
I mean, what more
could I ask for?

06:12.564 --> 06:14.233
Wait, did I mention
it was my birthday?

06:17.803 --> 06:20.006
It's pretty crazy, right?

06:20.039 --> 06:22.708
A little too crazy.

06:22.742 --> 06:25.011
I assume you're...

06:25.044 --> 06:26.946
embellishing things a bit?

06:26.979 --> 06:30.149
Okay, I mean, well,
you get the point.

06:30.182 --> 06:33.152
Well, I guess so.

06:33.185 --> 06:36.155
So, was there anything else
important that happened?

06:36.188 --> 06:38.024
Yeah, there was.

06:38.057 --> 06:40.159
Okay, so who's this one...
is this one from you?

06:40.192 --> 06:42.161
Oh, I know,
you always have the most...

06:42.194 --> 06:44.630
Job Dugan.

06:44.663 --> 06:47.565
Please report to
Principal Vanderbilt's office.

06:47.599 --> 06:49.601
Job Dugan.

06:49.635 --> 06:53.239
I can't make a decision
until I know more about it.

06:53.272 --> 06:55.741
I'll advise the administration
to follow up on it.

06:57.309 --> 06:59.011
Mhm.

06:59.045 --> 07:00.578
Okay, bye-bye.

07:00.612 --> 07:02.748
First day of school
and there's already drama.

07:02.782 --> 07:05.017
Yes, well, speaking of drama,

07:05.051 --> 07:08.721
your friend Sasha submitted this
for the fall theater production.

07:10.756 --> 07:13.325
Catchy title.

07:13.359 --> 07:14.994
What's the problem,
too many F-bombs,

07:15.027 --> 07:17.096
little nip slip?

07:17.129 --> 07:20.032
Became apparent that
all the characters in her story

07:20.066 --> 07:22.001
were based on
various faculty members

07:22.034 --> 07:24.203
and students at the school.

07:24.236 --> 07:26.972
If you look at the cast list,

07:27.006 --> 07:29.308
there's a Coach Titus,

07:29.341 --> 07:32.278
a failed football player who
only succeeded as a tight end

07:32.311 --> 07:34.313
- when it came to his rear end.
- I wonder

07:34.346 --> 07:36.348
if I'm in here somewhere.

07:36.382 --> 07:38.250
Knowing your history
with Ms. Berringer,

07:38.284 --> 07:40.386
I wanted to know if you had
any part in writing this.

07:40.419 --> 07:42.154
What? Uh, no, no,
this is all new to me.

07:42.188 --> 07:44.190
- Is it?
- It is, I mean,

07:44.223 --> 07:45.758
I wish I'd come up with
some of this stuff,

07:45.791 --> 07:47.660
but I didn't.

07:49.295 --> 07:51.797
Well, suffice it to say that

07:51.831 --> 07:53.999
the school will not
be producing this.

07:54.033 --> 07:57.203
I've already spoken to Sasha
and let her off with a warning.

07:57.236 --> 07:59.271
Sweet, coolio.

08:02.007 --> 08:04.243
Can I keep this?

08:04.276 --> 08:06.045
Just don't let
Coach Midas see it.

08:06.078 --> 08:08.914
Okay, awesome.

08:32.471 --> 08:34.340
So,

08:34.373 --> 08:36.175
who's happy to see me?

08:37.877 --> 08:39.678
It was total bullshit.

08:39.712 --> 08:41.313
Okay, yeah, I wrote about
everyone at school

08:41.347 --> 08:44.683
and I shat all over them,
like, a lot.

08:44.717 --> 08:45.985
But, that's not the point, it...

08:46.018 --> 08:47.386
it's supposed to be
tongue-in-cheek.

08:47.419 --> 08:49.755
I mean, it criticizes
that way of thinking,

08:49.788 --> 08:51.423
that kind of negativity,
ya know?

08:53.259 --> 08:55.427
- Who are you texting, huh?
- Oh, I was just texting Benjamin

08:55.461 --> 08:57.329
about how you said Mr. Decklin

08:57.363 --> 09:00.199
dreams of being in Dickland.

09:00.232 --> 09:04.036
What, I thought
it was funny, what?

09:04.069 --> 09:06.205
Look, I even wrote "LOL"
in all caps.

09:08.774 --> 09:10.709
And I know Todd
is going to get it now.

09:10.743 --> 09:12.111
Yeah, yeah.

09:12.144 --> 09:14.847
Screw Todd, Todd sucks.

09:14.880 --> 09:16.949
How did you work on this
all summer without telling me?

09:16.982 --> 09:19.418
I mean, I could've ragged on
so many of these people.

09:19.451 --> 09:21.187
Okay.

09:24.823 --> 09:26.725
Why are you still
looking at that?

09:26.759 --> 09:29.061
Haven't found my character yet.

09:29.094 --> 09:32.131
Oh, that reminds me,
you egomaniac.

09:35.067 --> 09:37.169
Whoa, I was just...

09:37.203 --> 09:38.404
Here, take.

09:46.278 --> 09:49.381
- Really?
- Happy birthday.

09:49.415 --> 09:51.383
What? It's practical.

09:58.857 --> 10:00.893
- You don't wanna come over?
- No, I will.

10:00.926 --> 10:02.528
I'm just a little frazzled
right now.

10:02.561 --> 10:05.397
Okay, just 'cause Vanderbutt
put the kibosh on your play

10:05.431 --> 10:07.833
- doesn't mean it's bad.
- I guess.

10:07.866 --> 10:09.301
I mean it, plus we can start
working on something

10:09.335 --> 10:10.936
for the spring.

10:10.970 --> 10:13.138
Yeah, maybe.

10:13.172 --> 10:15.474
Jeez, yeah, you are frazzled.

10:15.507 --> 10:18.477
Okay, yeah, go home
and unfrazzle yourself.

10:18.510 --> 10:20.813
Okay, I'll call you.

10:40.332 --> 10:42.134
Mom?

10:56.582 --> 10:58.384
Hey, Chuck.

11:04.256 --> 11:06.091
That's marvelous, Jim,
the same old form

11:06.125 --> 11:07.526
but 10 years ago, eh?

11:07.559 --> 11:09.395
Hey, Jerry, I want you
to meet Jim Thorpe.

11:09.428 --> 11:11.297
- My nephew, Jerry Miner, Jim.
- Hello, Jerry.

11:11.330 --> 11:12.898
Hello.

11:14.533 --> 11:16.168
Good timing.

11:16.201 --> 11:18.103
This is the best part.

11:18.137 --> 11:20.272
Already?

11:20.306 --> 11:21.974
Did you clean your room yet?

11:22.007 --> 11:23.575
Nope.

11:23.609 --> 11:25.444
Look, I know it's your birth...

11:25.477 --> 11:27.313
What are you doing?

11:27.346 --> 11:29.148
- I don't believe you.
- What, I was hungry, whoa!

11:29.181 --> 11:30.849
Yeah, well now you're not
gonna eat your dinner.

11:30.883 --> 11:33.085
I will, I will do that!

11:33.118 --> 11:35.254
I will be hungry again.

11:35.287 --> 11:38.457
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:38.490 --> 11:41.160
- If I doubt that you could...
- How about you hush?

11:42.361 --> 11:44.263
No, I remember all this.

11:44.296 --> 11:46.065
Yeah, I remember
how we almost died.

11:46.098 --> 11:47.900
Hey, this was your idea,

11:47.933 --> 11:49.501
and there wasn't even a ghost.

11:49.535 --> 11:51.203
You were glad
there wasn't a ghost.

11:51.236 --> 11:52.504
You would've pissed yourself.

11:52.538 --> 11:55.507
Well, yeah, but,

11:55.541 --> 11:58.344
so what?

11:58.377 --> 12:01.547
My favorite part is just
how they look exactly like us.

12:01.580 --> 12:04.651
Yeah, I spent a lot of time
getting that right.

12:04.684 --> 12:06.885
This is really awesome,
thanks, man.

12:06.919 --> 12:08.554
No problem.

12:08.587 --> 12:10.657
- Well, I'm gonna dip.
- What?

12:10.690 --> 12:13.058
It's my birthday,
you're not gonna stay?

12:13.092 --> 12:15.127
Uh, as of 12 minutes ago

12:15.160 --> 12:17.429
it isn't your birthday.

12:17.463 --> 12:21.467
Besides, I've gotta get started
on my new script.

12:21.500 --> 12:24.002
Shouldn't we wake her up?

12:24.036 --> 12:25.571
Uhh,

12:25.604 --> 12:28.340
she'll be fine.

12:28.374 --> 12:30.376
Thanks for coming over,
drive safe,

12:30.409 --> 12:32.144
don't let the bed bugs bite,
blah, blah, blah.

12:32.177 --> 12:34.012
- Will do, dude.
- Bye, Job.

12:34.046 --> 12:36.014
Hey, and see you guys
at church on Sunday.

12:36.048 --> 12:37.483
Ha, funny.

13:07.379 --> 13:10.516
So, yeah, I think that gives
a pretty good picture

13:10.549 --> 13:12.351
of how things were at the time.

13:14.987 --> 13:17.489
Hello?

13:17.523 --> 13:20.058
- Oh, man.
- I absolve you of all your sins,

13:20.092 --> 13:21.994
in the name of the Father
and the Son and the Holy Spirit.

13:22.027 --> 13:23.328
Father Bentley!

13:23.362 --> 13:25.497
How much did you miss?

13:25.531 --> 13:27.433
Oh.

13:27.466 --> 13:31.069
Well, I remember the part
where you said hi to me.

13:31.103 --> 13:33.439
Okay.

13:33.472 --> 13:36.542
Okay, no, it's fine, it's fine,
we'll just, um,

13:36.575 --> 13:38.210
we'll skip ahead.

13:38.243 --> 13:40.747
So, we gonna get to
the juicy parts?

13:40.780 --> 13:43.315
We're getting to
the part where...

13:43.348 --> 13:45.150
I met her.

13:45.184 --> 13:46.552
Mom, we're gonna be late.

13:52.591 --> 13:54.593
What?

14:00.032 --> 14:02.601
We'll just go
to a later service.

14:02.635 --> 14:06.038
Okay, I planned ahead.

14:06.071 --> 14:07.372
I knew we had church
this morning,

14:07.406 --> 14:10.409
so I went to bed early,
and look at me,

14:10.442 --> 14:11.610
I'm not tired at...

14:24.056 --> 14:26.091
So, what do you remember?

14:26.124 --> 14:27.493
Not much.

14:27.526 --> 14:30.395
You've gotta give me something.

14:30.429 --> 14:32.531
Penitence,
or something about penitence.

14:32.564 --> 14:34.634
- I think.
- Penitence?

14:34.667 --> 14:36.301
Um,

14:36.335 --> 14:39.739
how only the penitent will pass.

14:39.772 --> 14:42.541
Wait, isn't that a line from...

14:42.574 --> 14:44.076
Maria.

14:44.109 --> 14:45.477
Father Bentley.

14:45.511 --> 14:48.180
Oh, it's so good to see you.

14:48.213 --> 14:50.148
I got a little worried
when I didn't see you

14:50.182 --> 14:51.550
at the first service.

14:51.583 --> 14:55.287
Oh, well, we were just
running a little late.

14:55.320 --> 14:57.322
Tell me,

14:57.356 --> 15:00.325
what did you think
of my message?

15:00.359 --> 15:04.162
Well, um, I...

15:04.196 --> 15:06.064
Uh, I'm...

15:06.098 --> 15:08.200
gonna go over there.

15:08.233 --> 15:10.202
Oh, Job.

15:10.235 --> 15:12.504
Well, didn't even
see ya there, sport.

16:08.293 --> 16:10.262
Hey.

16:10.295 --> 16:12.899
Hi.

16:12.932 --> 16:16.134
How are you called?

16:16.168 --> 16:19.304
Alice, and you?

16:19.338 --> 16:21.573
Job.

16:21.607 --> 16:24.476
So, you, uh,

16:24.509 --> 16:27.279
been here long?

16:27.312 --> 16:29.816
More or less.

16:29.849 --> 16:32.919
What do you say we, uh,

16:32.952 --> 16:36.789
get out of this place?

16:36.823 --> 16:38.490
Yeah.

17:17.764 --> 17:20.532
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
cut the bologna.

17:20.565 --> 17:22.334
- What do you mean?
- First off,

17:22.367 --> 17:24.704
that was not
how your conversation went.

17:24.737 --> 17:26.906
What, how do you know?

17:26.939 --> 17:28.741
Well, if I recall correctly...

17:44.322 --> 17:46.458
Hey, I'm Job.

17:46.491 --> 17:48.661
You know, like, from the Bible.

17:48.695 --> 17:50.328
But, I mean, it's not like
there's a bunch of other Jobs

17:50.362 --> 17:52.632
that you could, you know,
get it confused with.

17:52.665 --> 17:53.966
I, um...

17:54.000 --> 17:55.600
I mean... I mean,
I think it stands

17:55.635 --> 17:58.370
for being persecuted,
but I don't really know

17:58.403 --> 18:00.640
what I'm being persecuted for,
ya know?

18:00.673 --> 18:03.643
I asked my mom and she was like,
"Oh, you gotta ask your father."

18:03.676 --> 18:06.244
But, he was dead by that point,
so it wasn't like that was

18:06.278 --> 18:08.681
really an option that, like,
she was considering...

18:08.715 --> 18:09.916
- I mean, she was just...
- Oh.

18:09.949 --> 18:11.316
I mean, I suppose
it's not the worst name,

18:11.349 --> 18:12.752
you know, it's not like Judas,

18:12.785 --> 18:14.654
or like, like, Adolf, you know?

18:14.687 --> 18:16.989
But, at least people
know how to say those names.

18:19.025 --> 18:21.728
So, are you, like,
from around here?

18:21.761 --> 18:23.763
I moved here
a couple months ago.

18:23.796 --> 18:25.732
What? Oh, that's awesome.

18:25.765 --> 18:28.266
What... what school you go to?

18:28.300 --> 18:29.601
Ridgeview High School.

18:29.635 --> 18:30.970
What?

18:31.003 --> 18:33.873
No way, I go to Ridgeview,
that's crazy!

18:33.906 --> 18:36.809
Maybe... maybe we'll be in
a class together sometime.

18:36.843 --> 18:38.678
Maybe.

18:41.346 --> 18:43.281
Wow, tss.

18:44.684 --> 18:46.585
Um, I should get going.

18:46.618 --> 18:48.721
Oh, yeah, yeah,
just totally, yeah, no, uh...

18:48.755 --> 18:51.791
I have to as well.

18:51.824 --> 18:53.960
Yeah, see ya maybe tomorrow.

18:53.993 --> 18:55.494
- Bye.
- At Ridgeview, 'cause we go

18:55.527 --> 18:57.329
to the same school...
whoa, real quick,

18:57.362 --> 18:58.965
what was your name?

18:58.998 --> 19:00.700
Alice.

19:00.733 --> 19:03.870
Alice, oh, that's crazy,
well, that's a great name.

19:03.903 --> 19:06.505
Well, uh, congrats.

19:06.538 --> 19:09.709
Really nice... nice job with the...
with the name.

19:09.742 --> 19:11.711
Uh, I'll see...

19:11.744 --> 19:13.780
I'll see ya, maybe tomorrow!

19:13.813 --> 19:16.314
Okay, so that might be
just a little closer

19:16.348 --> 19:18.017
to how things went.

19:18.050 --> 19:19.518
- So, what next?
- Well, I mean,

19:19.551 --> 19:20.887
I had to tell someone.

19:20.920 --> 19:22.922
It shouldn't be a problem.

19:22.955 --> 19:24.523
I thought of that
when I wrote the script.

19:24.556 --> 19:26.625
You don't think
there are too many roles?

19:26.659 --> 19:27.894
I wouldn't worry about it.

19:27.927 --> 19:30.763
I think, once word
gets out about my play,

19:30.797 --> 19:32.397
people are gonna
wanna be a part of it.

19:32.430 --> 19:34.499
Sasha, Sasha, Sasha!

19:34.533 --> 19:36.969
- Sasha!
- Okay, calm your butt cheeks.

19:37.003 --> 19:38.671
Okay, ugh.

19:38.704 --> 19:41.741
Job, hey, uh,
if ya haven't noticed,

19:41.774 --> 19:43.441
we're in the middle
of a meeting.

19:43.475 --> 19:44.877
Yeah, yeah, whatever, okay, so...

19:44.911 --> 19:48.346
- I was at church yesterday...
- Are you an actor?

19:50.149 --> 19:52.685
No, you're right, Todd,
I'm not an actor,

19:52.718 --> 19:55.087
but you don't look
like one to me either.

19:55.121 --> 19:57.123
I mean, leather jacket
and toothpick, yeah,

19:57.156 --> 19:59.058
Freud would have
a field day with you.

19:59.091 --> 20:02.128
Ha, sometimes a cigar
is just a cigar.

20:02.161 --> 20:06.398
Yeah, and sometimes
it's a really, really big cigar.

20:11.003 --> 20:13.338
- Ugh, let's go to the back.
- Suck it.

20:14.941 --> 20:18.476
Suck it hard.

20:18.510 --> 20:20.079
There's this girl,
and it's like, ahh,

20:20.112 --> 20:22.581
I mean, I'm just like,
"Why haven't we met before?"

20:22.614 --> 20:26.384
Ya know, like, why here, now,
at this time and place

20:26.418 --> 20:28.921
out of all the beautiful things
in the world?

20:28.955 --> 20:32.424
- So, there's someone you like?
- Like, what does that even mean?

20:32.457 --> 20:34.994
We say that, like, like, like,
like, like, like, like, like,

20:35.027 --> 20:36.662
all the time.

20:36.696 --> 20:38.530
What are you on?

20:43.602 --> 20:45.104
Okay.

20:45.137 --> 20:48.540
- Do you know her name?
- Yeah, it's Alice,

20:48.573 --> 20:50.977
and apparently she goes here.

20:51.010 --> 20:53.578
Well, I'm sure
you'll see her again,

20:53.612 --> 20:55.815
so there's no reason
for you to be

20:55.848 --> 20:58.784
acting weird.

20:58.818 --> 21:02.755
- You don't understand.
- Oh, my God, are you for real?

21:02.788 --> 21:04.957
- What?
- You're being stupid.

21:04.991 --> 21:07.827
Okay, so you like this person,
go do something about it.

21:07.860 --> 21:11.697
I am, I am gonna ask her out.

21:11.731 --> 21:13.633
Jesus Christ.

21:13.666 --> 21:15.433
But, I need to know
a little bit more about her.

21:15.467 --> 21:17.904
- Could... could ya help me?
- What did I just say

21:17.937 --> 21:20.106
about not being stupid?

21:20.139 --> 21:21.641
- So, yes?
- Hell no.

21:21.674 --> 21:23.709
I'm not gonna help you
stalk some random girl.

21:23.743 --> 21:25.577
Ooh, I can... I can pay you.

21:25.610 --> 21:28.681
Okay, I am done
with this conversation.

21:28.714 --> 21:30.149
No, you're right.

21:30.182 --> 21:33.551
Enough time for talk,
now it is time for action.

21:39.725 --> 21:43.229
All right, ooh, there she is.

21:43.262 --> 21:46.531
For Whom the Bell Tolls.

21:46.564 --> 21:48.634
Sounds spooky.

21:48.668 --> 21:50.169
Why don't you go talk to her?

21:50.202 --> 21:52.604
What? I don't wanna
come off as some creep.

22:03.749 --> 22:05.251
I wonder what
she's listening to.

22:12.024 --> 22:13.993
Hey, go ask her.

22:14.026 --> 22:16.696
What... I'm not sure.

22:16.729 --> 22:18.798
Oh, she's leaving.

22:18.831 --> 22:20.700
- Maybe she saw us.
- All right.

22:28.975 --> 22:31.877
Where are you going?

22:33.713 --> 22:35.281
What's up?

22:35.314 --> 22:36.749
So...

22:36.782 --> 22:39.752
What, how could this be?

22:39.785 --> 22:41.721
Here.

22:43.889 --> 22:44.957
Well, I'll see you around.

22:44.991 --> 22:46.558
- Have a good one.
- Thanks.

22:50.763 --> 22:52.631
- Hello?
- What did she say?

22:52.665 --> 22:55.301
- What?
- Alice.

22:55.334 --> 22:57.236
Where the heck?

22:57.269 --> 22:59.972
Oh, it's okay, there's
literally no way that she...

23:02.308 --> 23:04.677
Oh, nuts... here, take that, okay.

23:21.660 --> 23:23.195
You know you look
like a pedo creep

23:23.229 --> 23:24.964
hiding in a bush, right?

23:24.997 --> 23:26.866
Just give me... just need a...

23:26.899 --> 23:28.701
Okay, I'm good.

23:28.734 --> 23:30.970
Have you even considered

23:31.003 --> 23:33.839
talking to her,
like a normal human being?

23:33.873 --> 23:35.274
No, that's gross.

23:38.878 --> 23:41.280
All right, look,
she just wanted to know

23:41.313 --> 23:44.817
- more about the theater program.
- Theater, what?

23:44.850 --> 23:47.653
No way, I... I love theater.

23:47.686 --> 23:49.889
- How do I join?
- Did you read the book

23:49.922 --> 23:52.058
I gave you?

23:52.091 --> 23:53.859
- No.
- Then, no way.

23:53.893 --> 23:56.295
Job, you can't do
any kind of public speaking.

23:56.328 --> 23:57.830
When they call your name
during attendance,

23:57.863 --> 23:59.632
you have a miniature stroke.

24:01.100 --> 24:04.036
Okay, then I'll start
reading it then.

24:05.905 --> 24:08.674
Oh, God.

24:19.351 --> 24:21.253
Look, don't freak out.

24:21.287 --> 24:23.389
- What are you doing?
- Look, I've been asking you

24:23.422 --> 24:25.691
to clean your room
for two weeks.

24:25.724 --> 24:27.326
I still need these things!

24:30.362 --> 24:32.131
Really?

24:32.164 --> 24:34.333
- Even these?
- No, no, no, these can't go.

24:37.937 --> 24:39.371
You could give them
to your cousins.

24:39.405 --> 24:41.273
Uh, no, these are
important to me.

24:43.742 --> 24:45.344
All right.

24:45.377 --> 24:49.014
If I leave, you're going
to clean your room, right?

24:49.048 --> 24:51.050
Uh-huh.

25:05.831 --> 25:08.701
Come on, just one more job.

25:08.734 --> 25:11.971
Sorry, Mr. Ninja,
that life is behind me.

25:12.004 --> 25:15.441
But, Peter, I can't steal
the Hope Diamond by myself.

25:15.474 --> 25:18.210
I've got a wife and kids now.

25:21.380 --> 25:24.283
Oh, I see that.

25:24.316 --> 25:26.752
I guess there ain't much
I can say to convince ya.

25:29.955 --> 25:32.825
Well, say hi
to the missus for me.

25:35.261 --> 25:36.795
Wait!

25:39.165 --> 25:41.867
Do ya wanna grab dinner...

25:41.901 --> 25:44.403
one last time?

25:45.971 --> 25:48.974
Yeah, let's do it.

26:13.899 --> 26:16.168
Oh, my God!

26:24.476 --> 26:27.079
"Joan of Arc Ate the Steak."

26:27.112 --> 26:28.847
Hm.

26:38.791 --> 26:40.826
Hey.

26:40.859 --> 26:42.294
I didn't mean to
surprise you there, I just...

26:42.328 --> 26:44.296
- Hello.
- How are you doing?

26:44.330 --> 26:47.466
- Uh, I'm okay.
- That's good, that's good.

26:47.499 --> 26:51.370
- What were you listening to?
- Just some...

26:51.403 --> 26:53.872
- music.
- Music, oh.

26:53.906 --> 26:55.407
I like music, too.

26:58.811 --> 27:01.480
What are the odds?

27:01.513 --> 27:03.816
Hey, I, uh, saw you
reading something earlier.

27:03.849 --> 27:06.085
- What... what was it?
- It was, um, Hemingway.

27:06.118 --> 27:08.220
Oh, wow, you're smart.

27:08.254 --> 27:11.156
I'll... I'll probably be
reading this when I get home.

27:11.190 --> 27:12.558
You know,
ever since my dad died,

27:12.591 --> 27:14.526
I've just tried to, like,
throw myself into

27:14.560 --> 27:17.129
a bunch of different things,
and, uh, so I'm really excited

27:17.162 --> 27:18.931
to be a part of this production.

27:18.964 --> 27:21.033
Oh, okay.

27:21.066 --> 27:22.968
Are you waiting
on someone, or...?

27:23.002 --> 27:25.337
- Someone's picking me up.
- Oh, all right, are they late?

27:25.371 --> 27:27.239
'Cause, like, I could just
give you a ride if you...

27:27.273 --> 27:29.008
Whaaat.

27:51.597 --> 27:53.532
Bye.

28:14.920 --> 28:19.124
Who was that?

28:19.158 --> 28:21.193
That was Robert.

28:23.529 --> 28:25.497
- What?
- Robert Fonda.

28:25.531 --> 28:27.333
Football captain extraordinaire.

28:27.366 --> 28:28.934
Humble servant of the Lord.

28:28.967 --> 28:30.436
Um, what?

28:30.469 --> 28:32.237
I suppose introductions
are in order.

28:32.271 --> 28:33.505
Well, I'm Jim.

28:33.539 --> 28:35.908
These are my mates, Tim and Bim.

28:35.941 --> 28:37.976
- How do?
- My name's really Brandon,

28:38.010 --> 28:40.379
but that doesn't actually fit.

28:40.412 --> 28:44.316
We're Robert's best buds,
because we love Robert.

28:46.085 --> 28:47.654
Robert.

28:47.687 --> 28:50.055
Okay, so you guys are like

28:50.089 --> 28:52.391
his fan club, or...?

28:52.424 --> 28:54.526
- How'd you know?
- I guess word's getting around.

28:56.962 --> 28:58.130
Yeah.

29:00.132 --> 29:03.469
Well, it was nice
to meet you guys.

29:03.502 --> 29:05.604
Oh, we'll meet again,

29:05.638 --> 29:08.374
Bible boy.

29:08.407 --> 29:09.676
We shall... psh.

29:13.145 --> 29:14.681
Nice to meet you.

29:19.551 --> 29:22.287
Bible boy, okay.

29:27.727 --> 29:30.262
- Do you know Robert Fonda?
- Jeez.

29:30.295 --> 29:32.398
Where did you come from?

29:32.431 --> 29:35.434
He's Alice's boyfriend,
I think.

29:35.467 --> 29:37.136
Yeesh, sorry.

29:37.169 --> 29:38.638
He plays football, I think.

29:38.671 --> 29:41.306
Uh, yeah, he's like
the best player on the team.

29:41.340 --> 29:44.143
How do you not know him?

29:44.176 --> 29:46.378
Do you wanna, like,
help me scope out this guy?

29:46.412 --> 29:49.515
And his three goons,
or whatever they are.

29:49.548 --> 29:52.351
Well, unlike you,
I have important things to do.

29:52.384 --> 29:54.987
- Yeah, like what?
- Well, auditions are next week,

29:55.020 --> 29:56.522
so I'll be
getting ready for that.

29:56.555 --> 29:58.390
Also, I got this.

29:58.424 --> 30:01.160
What, is this your new script,
can I read it, can I help?

30:01.193 --> 30:02.662
If you have a cure
for writer's block,

30:02.695 --> 30:04.296
that'd be a good start.

30:04.329 --> 30:06.532
Well, just write about
what you know.

30:06.565 --> 30:08.967
Yeah, but all I know
is petty high school drama.

30:09.001 --> 30:10.469
No one wants to read that shit.

30:12.538 --> 30:14.973
Is there anyone
you're interested in right now?

30:15.007 --> 30:16.676
What? No.

30:16.709 --> 30:19.211
Come on, what about Todd,
rekindle an old flame?

30:19.244 --> 30:20.680
Okay, that was in the 7th grade,

30:20.713 --> 30:22.381
and it was for like two weeks.

30:22.414 --> 30:24.316
- Why are you bringing that up?
- I'm just saying,

30:24.349 --> 30:26.518
maybe you need to
change things up a bit,

30:26.552 --> 30:29.154
try something new, ya know?

30:29.188 --> 30:32.357
Would you look at that,
it's half past bullshit.

30:32.391 --> 30:34.993
- I gotta bounce.
- Okay, don't be butt hurt.

30:35.027 --> 30:37.196
Are you... are you
actually butt hurt?

30:37.229 --> 30:39.064
You need a hobby.

30:49.475 --> 30:52.211
Uh, thanks for
helping me out again.

30:52.244 --> 30:54.546
Anything for the Lord.

30:54.580 --> 30:56.783
Can you draw me a dinosaur?

30:56.816 --> 30:59.518
Yeah.

30:59.551 --> 31:02.722
I don't know, what do you think?

31:02.755 --> 31:05.157
Uh, I'm not sure.

31:05.190 --> 31:07.125
I... I don't really
know her that well.

31:07.159 --> 31:10.229
It's just she's dating
this dumb jock.

31:10.262 --> 31:12.164
- Maybe look for someone else?
- Okay, I am looking for

31:12.197 --> 31:16.803
- realistic solutions here.
- I'm sorry.

31:16.836 --> 31:18.771
I'm sorry
I can't be more helpful.

31:18.805 --> 31:21.173
I mean, it's not your fault.

31:24.476 --> 31:27.112
- Here ya go.
- Thank you.

31:29.181 --> 31:31.049
Hey, you should come over,
it's been a while

31:31.083 --> 31:33.552
- since we hung out.
- Sure, I actually have

31:33.585 --> 31:35.487
been working on a project
I wanna show you.

31:35.521 --> 31:37.322
Okay, I'm down.

31:37.356 --> 31:38.758
Just let me know.

31:43.195 --> 31:45.597
I mean, like, I can't even
put it into words.

31:45.632 --> 31:47.332
I wouldn't say it's,
like, love at first sight,

31:47.366 --> 31:49.334
but there was definitely, like,
a connection there, ya know?

31:56.341 --> 31:57.777
I just... I just feel like
we're always being targeted

31:57.810 --> 32:00.212
because we're Christians, like...

32:00.245 --> 32:02.715
I agree, I agree, we always
have a target on our back,

32:02.749 --> 32:05.117
just like we always have
a cross around our neck.

32:07.586 --> 32:09.354
Hey.

32:09.388 --> 32:10.757
Hi.

32:10.790 --> 32:12.859
Hey, you're in
my Chemistry class, right?

32:12.892 --> 32:16.194
- I'm Robert.
- Uh, Job.

32:16.228 --> 32:18.130
Wait, Job, like from the Bible?

32:18.163 --> 32:20.566
- Yeah, that's... that's the one.
- Oh, that's sick, man.

32:20.599 --> 32:22.601
Job is one
of my favorite stories

32:22.635 --> 32:25.103
in the Bible.

32:25.137 --> 32:26.639
- This is Alice.
- Yeah, we...

32:26.673 --> 32:30.142
We know each other,
we actually met at church.

32:30.175 --> 32:32.611
Oh, that's lit.

32:32.645 --> 32:34.647
So, how are you liking theater?

32:34.681 --> 32:37.282
Uh, I like it, um,
Sasha has really

32:37.316 --> 32:38.885
been helping me a lot.

32:38.918 --> 32:40.653
Sounds like you two
are good friends.

32:40.687 --> 32:43.823
Yeah, yeah, I mean,
but we're just

32:43.856 --> 32:45.457
friends, though, so.

32:53.900 --> 32:55.802
Hey, I don't know
what your schedule is like,

32:55.835 --> 32:58.236
but I run a Bible study.

32:58.270 --> 33:01.306
We meet once a week
in Ms. Price's room.

33:01.340 --> 33:03.575
I'm just throwing it out there,
if you're interested.

33:03.609 --> 33:06.144
Okay, yeah, I'll, uh,

33:06.178 --> 33:08.146
keep that in mind.

33:15.855 --> 33:17.589
Well, we're gonna head out soon.

33:19.324 --> 33:22.494
Oh, yeah, I gotta
do things as well, so,

33:22.527 --> 33:24.697
I'm just gonna...

33:24.731 --> 33:26.264
- Bye.
- Bye.

33:26.298 --> 33:29.601
Oh, ha-ha, see ya.

33:29.636 --> 33:31.904
Bye.

33:51.958 --> 33:54.927
Sasha?

33:54.961 --> 33:57.529
Are you there?

33:57.562 --> 33:59.197
Are you dead?

34:03.335 --> 34:05.772
You look really dead
right now, so...

34:07.774 --> 34:10.409
...if you could say something...

34:12.779 --> 34:15.748
...or, like,

34:15.782 --> 34:18.951
move a little bit,
that would be reassuring.

34:25.390 --> 34:27.325
Uh, you got something
on your... on your...

34:28.895 --> 34:30.663
...purple on your face.

34:30.697 --> 34:32.699
I bombed.

34:32.732 --> 34:34.433
Oh, are auditions today?

34:34.466 --> 34:36.703
I told you
like a gazillion times.

34:36.736 --> 34:39.271
Whoops.

34:39.304 --> 34:40.605
I tried for the part
of Grape Lady,

34:40.640 --> 34:42.607
but I kept messing up.

34:44.977 --> 34:46.779
I really want that part.

34:48.915 --> 34:50.983
Okay, it is way too early
in this semester

34:51.017 --> 34:53.920
for you to be
burning out already.

34:53.953 --> 34:56.488
Are ya hungry?

34:56.521 --> 34:59.424
Okay, let's start there.

34:59.458 --> 35:01.894
Hello, my name is Job and I'll
be your server this evening.

35:01.928 --> 35:03.462
Can I get you something
to eat or...?

35:03.495 --> 35:06.498
- There's pizza in the fridge.
- A fine choice.

35:06.531 --> 35:08.801
I'll, uh... I'll fix that up
for you right away.

35:23.983 --> 35:26.719
Okay, it says that we...

35:26.753 --> 35:28.688
So, Todd, how's the, uh,
play coming along?

35:28.721 --> 35:30.589
- Swell, Job.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, I've heard.

35:30.622 --> 35:32.725
Yeah, I've heard.

35:32.759 --> 35:34.827
- I think we're supposed to...
- It's a shame

35:34.861 --> 35:36.495
what happened to Sasha.

35:36.528 --> 35:38.330
She could've made
an excellent director.

35:38.363 --> 35:41.299
Oh, wow, wow, sounds like
you're still, uh, bitter.

35:41.333 --> 35:42.869
Mm.

35:42.902 --> 35:45.403
- Sour grapes?
- Oh, well at least

35:45.437 --> 35:48.641
I'm not so... basic.

35:48.674 --> 35:51.778
At least my jokes
aren't acid... nine.

35:51.811 --> 35:54.046
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

36:24.110 --> 36:27.345
Ah, I see we're at an impasse.

36:27.379 --> 36:30.448
Give it up, Todd,
this pineapple is mineapple.

36:30.482 --> 36:32.752
- Still at it with the puns, eh?
- Oh, yeah?

36:32.785 --> 36:34.754
Well, at least my hair
isn't dumb.

36:36.789 --> 36:39.659
Ooh-hoo,
seems I've struck a nerve.

36:41.393 --> 36:42.829
My hair is cool!

36:42.862 --> 36:44.429
Oh, yeah, well, what if I...
what if I just do it...

36:44.462 --> 36:45.932
just a little bit of... like this?

36:48.901 --> 36:52.738
Don't touch my hair!

37:01.180 --> 37:02.882
I'm finished.

37:04.984 --> 37:07.720
I'm finished!

37:15.661 --> 37:17.830
Hey, can I see your answers?

37:23.202 --> 37:25.104
Well, what about the play?

37:25.137 --> 37:26.939
Oh, well, uh, Sasha told me
I could be a stagehand,

37:26.973 --> 37:30.142
so, uh, there was still a chance
for me to be around Alice.

37:32.011 --> 37:34.146
What, what?

37:34.180 --> 37:37.582
Oh, I just decided I needed
to do more to impress her,

37:37.616 --> 37:39.752
and I, um...
I guess I got desperate,

37:39.785 --> 37:44.023
so I... I ended up doing something
I thought I'd never do.

37:50.029 --> 37:51.797
Okay, reset!

37:53.833 --> 37:55.167
Push yourself!

37:55.201 --> 37:57.904
I've seen dead people
crawl faster.

37:57.937 --> 38:00.172
I honestly thought
it wouldn't be too hard.

38:00.206 --> 38:01.207
I thought I could
fake it till I...

38:03.709 --> 38:04.977
Job, was it?

38:05.011 --> 38:07.046
Yeah, you didn't make the cut.

38:07.079 --> 38:08.915
But, we need
an equipment assistant,

38:08.948 --> 38:11.449
and you can start by
getting all this stuff together.

38:28.000 --> 38:31.569
- And if you'll turn to James...
- Hello, fellow Christians!

38:31.603 --> 38:32.905
Okay, one sec.

38:32.939 --> 38:36.574
Uhh, hi, Job.

38:36.608 --> 38:38.711
How do ya do, Robert?

38:38.744 --> 38:40.612
- Hope I didn't miss anything.
- No.

38:40.646 --> 38:43.615
We were just
about to read a verse.

38:43.649 --> 38:45.785
Great.

38:48.287 --> 38:51.824
So, James 2:17.

38:51.857 --> 38:54.827
"Even so faith,
if it hath not works,

38:54.860 --> 38:57.562
is dead being alone."

38:57.595 --> 38:58.864
What I like about
this passage is that...

38:58.898 --> 39:02.702
I read the Bible
almost every day,

39:02.735 --> 39:06.238
and I go to church every week.

39:06.272 --> 39:07.940
Ever since my dad died, I...

39:10.643 --> 39:12.878
...my mom and I

39:12.912 --> 39:15.881
have never missed a service,

39:15.915 --> 39:19.051
and I guess it's kinda...

39:19.085 --> 39:20.920
our way of keeping
his memory alive.

39:22.788 --> 39:24.690
Ya know?

39:29.862 --> 39:31.797
So,

39:31.831 --> 39:35.234
let's get back to the passage.

39:35.267 --> 39:37.136
Right on.

39:54.754 --> 39:57.056
- Who am I?
- There's that...

39:57.089 --> 39:58.623
- What?
- Understudy?

40:01.626 --> 40:03.295
- Jerk.
- I know.

40:09.101 --> 40:11.003
Hey, congratulations.

40:11.037 --> 40:14.273
- Hi.
- Oh, I, um... I brought you these.

40:14.306 --> 40:15.775
There ya go,
you just take those,

40:15.808 --> 40:17.810
- you're welcome.
- Thank you.

40:17.843 --> 40:20.146
So, I, uh... I didn't wanna know...

40:20.179 --> 40:22.281
I didn't know... I didn't know...
I didn't know if, you know...

40:22.314 --> 40:24.050
if you wanted some help,
like, uh,

40:24.083 --> 40:26.018
running lines or anything,
'cause I've read

40:26.052 --> 40:27.887
the whole script,
so I know all the parts,

40:27.920 --> 40:29.255
and, uh, I wanna know

40:29.288 --> 40:32.058
if you wanted some help.

40:32.091 --> 40:33.692
- Um.
- I mean, if not,

40:33.726 --> 40:36.295
that's totally cool as well,
I just, you know,

40:36.328 --> 40:39.597
wanted to...

40:39.632 --> 40:41.033
Sure.

40:43.636 --> 40:46.305
Cool.

40:46.338 --> 40:48.274
What was that?

40:48.307 --> 40:51.343
I mean, come on,
this is act three, people!

40:51.377 --> 40:53.279
Act three, we have to feel it!

40:53.312 --> 40:55.147
It comes from your toes.

40:55.181 --> 40:56.982
You're all acting from up here.

40:57.016 --> 40:58.951
It's all in your head,
get it out!

40:58.984 --> 41:00.719
Get it out of your head!
All right, everyone,

41:00.753 --> 41:03.722
come with me, we're gonna feel
from our feet this time,

41:03.756 --> 41:06.892
and come on, tears, tears!

41:06.926 --> 41:08.694
Your family has been...

41:21.107 --> 41:23.809
Robert, Robert, Robert,

41:23.843 --> 41:26.345
Robert, Robert, Robert, Robert!

42:20.065 --> 42:22.434
It's Sasha,
there's a beep coming,

42:22.468 --> 42:24.336
but I trust you know what to do.

42:31.010 --> 42:33.479
Thank you.

42:37.783 --> 42:39.818
Thank you.

42:57.836 --> 42:59.405
Look at the stars.

42:59.438 --> 43:01.941
In times of distress,
they will always be there.

43:03.442 --> 43:05.110
Yes.

43:05.144 --> 43:07.313
I can see them now.

43:07.346 --> 43:10.849
How does it make you feel?

43:10.883 --> 43:14.286
It makes me sad.

43:14.320 --> 43:16.055
What else?

43:18.157 --> 43:20.025
It...

43:23.095 --> 43:24.930
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
what was that?

43:24.964 --> 43:27.032
I... just I'm not
comfortable with...

43:27.066 --> 43:28.400
But, you're acting.

43:28.434 --> 43:31.237
- It doesn't matter.
- I... I just...

43:31.270 --> 43:33.138
- But, you're acting.
- I just...

43:33.172 --> 43:34.773
- It doesn't matter!
- I just can't.

43:34.807 --> 43:37.009
It's not that hard, Alice.

43:40.813 --> 43:43.782
Aw, are you kidding me?

43:46.518 --> 43:48.921
Hey, hey, wait up.

43:55.094 --> 43:56.362
Are you okay?

43:58.297 --> 44:01.800
- Just leave me alone.
- Okay, that was messed up.

44:01.834 --> 44:04.470
Sasha shouldn't have done that.

44:04.503 --> 44:06.005
If you have a problem
with the play,

44:06.038 --> 44:10.142
you should
talk to Todd about it.

44:10.175 --> 44:11.910
I mean, I can... I can
talk to him if you want.

44:15.314 --> 44:18.050
Hey.

44:18.083 --> 44:20.552
I think you're
a really great actress.

44:22.921 --> 44:24.957
Thank you.

44:31.130 --> 44:33.032
- Yeah.
- Our Father,

44:33.065 --> 44:36.268
who art in heaven,
hallowed by Thy name.

44:36.302 --> 44:39.204
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done

44:39.238 --> 44:42.074
on Earth as it is in heaven.

44:42.107 --> 44:43.309
That actually
sounds pretty good.

44:43.342 --> 44:46.278
I like vanilla...

44:46.312 --> 44:48.380
So, what about your place, Tim?

44:48.414 --> 44:51.417
Sorry, Robert, but my parents
are home all week.

44:51.450 --> 44:53.052
What's... what's wrong, guys?

44:53.085 --> 44:55.220
We... we need a place
to throw a party

44:55.254 --> 44:56.889
after the game on Friday.

44:56.922 --> 44:58.257
But, we can't have it at
my place 'cause my parents

44:58.290 --> 45:00.392
are having guests over.

45:00.426 --> 45:01.994
Well, what about my place?

45:02.027 --> 45:03.929
I mean, my mom works
in the evenings,

45:03.962 --> 45:06.031
so the house will be empty.

45:06.065 --> 45:08.434
That'd be great, yeah.

45:08.467 --> 45:10.169
Wait, hold on.

45:10.202 --> 45:12.171
Do you even know
how to throw a party?

45:12.204 --> 45:14.473
Oh, I can throw a party.

45:15.441 --> 45:17.009
Whoo!

45:19.211 --> 45:20.647
All right.

45:49.475 --> 45:52.277
That's so cute!

46:12.732 --> 46:16.301
Hey! Welcome
to my humble abode.

46:18.137 --> 46:19.972
That felt stupid, but okay.

46:20.005 --> 46:22.975
Wow, you really went all out.

46:23.008 --> 46:24.510
Yeah, I don't mess around.

46:24.543 --> 46:26.612
It looks nice.

46:26.646 --> 46:28.414
Thanks.

46:33.218 --> 46:34.086
What is this?

46:34.119 --> 46:36.088
Oh, what, you don't
like the decor?

46:36.121 --> 46:39.625
It kind of reminds me of
Casablanca a little bit.

46:43.562 --> 46:45.297
The old Hollywood movie?

46:47.199 --> 46:48.735
That's real impressive
knowledge there, Bim.

46:48.768 --> 46:51.437
Yeah, real impressive!

46:51.470 --> 46:55.073
- Thanks!
- Hey, we'll always have Paris.

46:55.107 --> 46:56.475
Hey, here's looking at you, kid!

46:58.577 --> 47:00.379
Hey, Jim, go long!

47:00.412 --> 47:02.514
Just make sure you don't
take someone's head off!

47:04.416 --> 47:06.985
- So, how are you guys?
- Robert, hey!

47:07.019 --> 47:08.020
Hey, Robert!

47:08.053 --> 47:09.988
Yo, Rob, come over here!

47:10.022 --> 47:11.490
I'll be right back.

47:14.092 --> 47:18.397
Um, do you wanna go
out back or something?

47:20.165 --> 47:21.300
Sure.

47:21.333 --> 47:22.601
Yeah, it's been going great.

47:22.635 --> 47:25.571
Funny enough, we're actually
talking about the Book of Job.

47:25.604 --> 47:26.472
That's funny.

47:26.505 --> 47:28.240
Yeah, it's hard
to read the stories

47:28.273 --> 47:32.077
and not imagine myself
in all of them.

47:32.110 --> 47:33.713
- You seem very busy.
- Yeah,

47:33.746 --> 47:37.717
between homework
and theater and football,

47:37.750 --> 47:39.218
I mean, it's a lot.

47:40.519 --> 47:43.055
Thank you for helping me
practice my lines.

47:43.088 --> 47:45.457
Yeah, yeah, of course, Alice.

47:45.491 --> 47:47.526
Or should I say...

47:47.559 --> 47:48.594
Grape Lady.

47:51.296 --> 47:53.700
See, there are traitors
among us!

47:53.733 --> 47:55.267
Traitors, oh, my heavens!

47:55.300 --> 47:56.803
Yes. They are everywhere,

47:56.836 --> 47:58.805
but fear not, my good lady.

47:58.838 --> 48:01.073
I will protect you.

48:07.112 --> 48:09.047
Anyway, enough of
that acting stuff.

48:09.081 --> 48:10.115
You should be in the cast!

48:10.148 --> 48:14.119
Yeah, well, stage fright
doesn't really jive well

48:14.152 --> 48:17.189
- with the stage.
- You'd be good.

48:17.222 --> 48:18.791
Thanks.

48:18.825 --> 48:20.092
Hey, Benjamin, what's up?

48:20.125 --> 48:21.460
How've you been?

48:21.493 --> 48:24.329
Can I talk to you
someplace else?

48:24.363 --> 48:26.198
Yeah, sure.

48:26.231 --> 48:28.467
I'll see you later.

48:31.236 --> 48:33.105
Singles, right?

48:49.321 --> 48:51.490
Oh. Sorry for the mess.

48:53.525 --> 48:55.494
What's up?

48:55.527 --> 48:57.697
Why are you doing this?

48:57.730 --> 48:59.331
Doing what?

48:59.364 --> 49:01.199
All these people.

49:01.233 --> 49:03.703
Hey, we're just hanging out.

49:06.305 --> 49:08.073
Hey, whoa, what's wrong?

49:09.676 --> 49:11.476
What? Come on.

49:12.444 --> 49:13.880
What's going on?

49:19.686 --> 49:21.286
I'm sorry.

49:24.222 --> 49:25.725
It all makes sense.

49:25.758 --> 49:26.859
What?

49:28.661 --> 49:30.295
You're disgusting.

49:33.198 --> 49:34.801
Wait, I'm not gay!

49:40.907 --> 49:46.478
I mean, there's nothing wrong
with being gay.

49:46.511 --> 49:49.882
I love gay people,
but not in a gay way,

49:49.916 --> 49:52.284
'cause I'm not gay.

49:52.317 --> 49:55.822
I'm just supporting the cause.

49:58.624 --> 49:59.926
Yeah, fine.

49:59.959 --> 50:02.527
We don't want
homophobes here anyway!

50:02.561 --> 50:04.463
And yeah, I'm gonna say it,
you're just a dumb jock!

50:04.496 --> 50:06.298
Oh, yeah, well,
at least I don't talk

50:06.331 --> 50:08.768
about my dead dad all the time.

50:29.521 --> 50:30.823
I need a drink.

50:36.294 --> 50:38.798
Sasha!

50:40.900 --> 50:42.434
Sasha!

50:43.335 --> 50:45.705
Job, shut up!

50:55.748 --> 50:56.749
What do you want?

50:57.717 --> 50:58.851
What's wrong?

51:00.820 --> 51:02.955
You're a real asshole,
you know that?

51:16.736 --> 51:18.938
Jesus Christ.

51:30.016 --> 51:32.417
Why are you so nice to me?

51:34.286 --> 51:36.756
I have no clue.

51:41.626 --> 51:42.995
It would just be
really nice if...

51:43.029 --> 51:43.996
shit!

51:44.030 --> 51:45.230
Oh.

51:46.799 --> 51:48.735
- Dammit.
- I'm sorry, Sasha.

51:48.768 --> 51:51.269
Goddamnit!

51:52.672 --> 51:54.372
Oh, goddamnit.

51:54.406 --> 51:56.308
What is going on?

51:56.341 --> 51:57.576
What's going on?

51:57.609 --> 51:59.444
Who's that?

51:59.478 --> 52:00.813
And you're supposed to be
at work.

52:00.847 --> 52:02.849
Why does that matter?

52:02.882 --> 52:04.851
Actually, I don't know.

52:06.518 --> 52:08.320
Have you been drinking?

52:08.353 --> 52:09.454
Only water.

52:16.394 --> 52:19.065
Where did you get this?

52:19.098 --> 52:22.802
Uh, it was
in the storage room.

52:22.835 --> 52:25.570
Just in some random box.

52:28.540 --> 52:30.910
Take it off, Job.

52:30.943 --> 52:32.310
What, you just want me
to strip down and...

52:32.344 --> 52:33.746
Job!

52:40.485 --> 52:41.586
I could maybe
make a suggestion...

52:41.620 --> 52:43.388
Stay out of this.

52:48.694 --> 52:49.896
All right.

52:49.929 --> 52:52.364
I'll go.

53:06.378 --> 53:07.847
You gonna be okay?

53:09.115 --> 53:10.983
Yeah, um...

53:17.924 --> 53:19.959
Can you just help me
get these kids out of here?

53:19.992 --> 53:21.661
Yeah. Yeah.

53:40.713 --> 53:41.981
Hey, Jim, go long!

53:45.151 --> 53:48.020
- The football knocked her out.
- Oh, my gosh, is she okay?

53:48.054 --> 53:49.755
- Did you see...
- You should go check on her.

53:49.789 --> 53:51.157
- Is there ice around?
- What happened?

53:51.190 --> 53:52.859
- He ran away.
- Someone go help her.

53:52.892 --> 53:54.660
She needs help.

53:54.694 --> 53:56.128
- Mom.
- Oh, my gosh.

53:56.162 --> 53:59.765
- Someone call an ambulance.
- Ambulance is on its way, guys.

54:08.741 --> 54:09.809
I'm...

54:11.677 --> 54:13.145
I'm Lance, by the way.

54:15.181 --> 54:16.381
Yeah.

54:20.720 --> 54:23.823
I'm sorry, I just can't
really think right now.

54:23.856 --> 54:25.423
I mean, it's...

54:28.560 --> 54:30.062
I get it, I mean,
it's not like

54:30.096 --> 54:33.132
- things could really be much...
- Oh, and the cops are here.

54:42.942 --> 54:44.644
Oy vey!

54:45.811 --> 54:46.913
Yup.

54:48.781 --> 54:50.783
Well, as far as penance goes...

54:55.655 --> 54:57.123
Sorry, I gotta take this.

55:06.766 --> 55:10.069
You have one new message

55:10.102 --> 55:13.639
from Sasha Berringer.

55:13.673 --> 55:15.808
To play the message, press one.

55:16.742 --> 55:17.710
Okay.

55:20.545 --> 55:21.781
Where were we?

55:21.814 --> 55:25.718
Um, talking about penance.

55:25.751 --> 55:29.789
The next few days
were difficult.

55:33.591 --> 55:34.827
I ended up getting suspended

55:34.860 --> 55:37.063
and was required to do
community service.

55:40.299 --> 55:41.867
My mom had a concussion,

55:41.901 --> 55:43.903
so I figured
I could fill in for her

55:43.936 --> 55:46.038
to kill two birds
with one stone.

56:25.911 --> 56:28.914
Hey, Job-y boyo.

56:28.948 --> 56:30.316
I hate to break it to you,

56:30.349 --> 56:32.550
but since you're suspended,

56:32.584 --> 56:34.720
you can't be part
of the play anymore.

56:34.754 --> 56:36.088
I figured
you already knew that,

56:36.122 --> 56:38.590
but I wanted to say it myself.

56:38.623 --> 56:41.593
Anyway, ciao!

56:53.205 --> 56:54.306
It's Sasha.

56:54.340 --> 56:57.243
There's a beep coming,
but I trust you know what to do.

57:05.684 --> 57:07.585
Hi, you've reached Benjamin May.

57:07.619 --> 57:08.821
I can't come to the phone
right now,

57:08.854 --> 57:09.955
but if you leave a message,

57:09.989 --> 57:11.924
I'll call you back
as soon as I can.

57:11.957 --> 57:13.292
Thanks!

57:20.332 --> 57:23.702
- Hello?
- Hey, Jim!

57:23.736 --> 57:26.739
It's Job, what's going on?

57:37.817 --> 57:38.751
Oh, no.

57:55.067 --> 57:56.335
Come on, come on, come on.

58:01.740 --> 58:03.876
- Job!
- Chuck's dying.

58:03.909 --> 58:06.045
To what do I owe the pleasure?

58:07.913 --> 58:09.014
Oh, you're wrong.

58:10.116 --> 58:11.851
Wait, he's okay?

58:11.884 --> 58:13.219
No, he's dead.

58:13.252 --> 58:14.987
What?

58:15.020 --> 58:16.655
Come on in.

58:18.424 --> 58:20.192
Well, I'm impressed.

58:20.226 --> 58:22.094
You managed
to kill a succulent.

58:22.128 --> 58:24.830
Are you sure he's dead,
there's nothing we can do?

58:24.864 --> 58:25.965
Nope.

58:25.998 --> 58:29.135
I'm afraid Chuck has
officially kicked the bucket.

58:29.168 --> 58:31.403
Can we resurrect him?

58:32.371 --> 58:34.373
That's funny!

58:34.406 --> 58:35.841
I'll have to remember that one.

58:35.875 --> 58:37.743
But Chuck...

58:46.252 --> 58:48.220
Here.

58:48.254 --> 58:49.221
Why don't you try this one?

58:49.255 --> 58:51.290
No, I'll just ruthlessly murder
that one, too.

58:52.391 --> 58:54.260
No, you won't.

58:54.293 --> 58:56.762
Look, people think taking care
of plants is hard,

58:56.795 --> 58:58.130
but it's really not.

58:58.164 --> 59:00.432
Plants have
a very basic set of needs

59:00.466 --> 59:03.969
and you just have to remember
what they are.

59:07.106 --> 59:09.141
All right.

59:09.175 --> 59:10.776
I'll give it a shot.

59:10.809 --> 59:12.411
That's the spirit.

59:15.481 --> 59:19.084
Hey, what are you
gonna name him?

59:19.118 --> 59:21.954
I don't know, like, Bob or...

59:21.987 --> 59:22.988
Well, that's perfect!

59:23.022 --> 59:24.223
Rhymes with your name!

59:25.257 --> 59:27.726
Yup.

59:27.760 --> 59:29.195
Yeah, it does.

59:41.473 --> 59:43.442
Initially, I didn't even know
how to do it.

59:43.475 --> 59:45.911
I kept trying
to use my fingers and then...

59:47.012 --> 59:48.480
Hey!

59:52.418 --> 59:53.385
What are you doing here?

59:53.419 --> 59:56.322
I was actually gonna ask you
the same thing.

59:56.355 --> 59:58.257
I just volunteer here.

59:58.290 --> 1:00:00.125
Whenever I can.

1:00:00.159 --> 1:00:03.929
My mom actually works here,
so I help out sometimes.

1:00:03.963 --> 1:00:05.397
I gotta go.

1:00:05.431 --> 1:00:07.266
Richard, Liz.

1:00:11.503 --> 1:00:13.839
Are you Maria's boy?

1:00:13.872 --> 1:00:15.374
Uh, yeah.

1:00:15.407 --> 1:00:17.543
You look like it.

1:00:17.576 --> 1:00:19.445
Is it... is it Job?

1:00:19.478 --> 1:00:21.313
Yeah, yeah, that's me.

1:00:21.347 --> 1:00:23.515
You know, she talks about you
all the time.

1:00:23.549 --> 1:00:25.217
- Really?
- Yeah.

1:00:25.251 --> 1:00:28.087
And we're getting
pretty sick of it, to be honest.

1:00:30.356 --> 1:00:32.825
What does she say?

1:00:38.163 --> 1:00:41.867
You didn't think you were just
gonna sneak by me, did you?

1:00:56.115 --> 1:00:57.516
What's going on?

1:00:58.417 --> 1:00:59.952
It's a lot.

1:00:59.985 --> 1:01:01.353
Okay.

1:01:03.889 --> 1:01:05.124
No, like, it's so much,
I don't think

1:01:05.157 --> 1:01:08.093
I can fill you in on everything.

1:01:08.127 --> 1:01:12.331
Seems to me like
you're being evasive.

1:01:12.364 --> 1:01:13.999
Okay.

1:01:19.538 --> 1:01:24.009
First off,
I'm sorry for the party.

1:01:24.043 --> 1:01:25.411
It was really, really stupid,

1:01:25.444 --> 1:01:28.547
and I never should've done it.

1:01:31.417 --> 1:01:32.951
I lied.

1:01:34.286 --> 1:01:36.188
I talked to Sasha.

1:01:36.221 --> 1:01:38.057
She told me a little bit...

1:01:38.090 --> 1:01:40.392
- oh, come on!
- Mm, why?

1:01:40.426 --> 1:01:42.328
She didn't tell me everything!

1:01:42.361 --> 1:01:43.962
Oh, come on.

1:01:43.996 --> 1:01:45.497
Oh, Job, quit being a baby.

1:01:45.531 --> 1:01:48.367
- Come on, sit up!
- Mom.

1:01:48.400 --> 1:01:51.937
Look, I don't know
all the details,

1:01:51.970 --> 1:01:55.174
and really, I don't need to.

1:01:55.207 --> 1:01:57.609
The details aren't important.

1:01:59.378 --> 1:02:05.050
I know that you like
to... aggrandize.

1:02:07.186 --> 1:02:09.621
I just want you to sit back

1:02:09.656 --> 1:02:12.024
and take a look
at the whole picture

1:02:12.057 --> 1:02:17.029
and think about
what really matters to you.

1:02:18.397 --> 1:02:19.598
Yeah.

1:02:19.632 --> 1:02:22.067
I guess sometimes
I just kinda

1:02:22.101 --> 1:02:23.902
get lost in my head.

1:02:24.970 --> 1:02:27.106
Life is dramatic enough.

1:02:27.139 --> 1:02:30.209
Don't make it
any more than it needs to be.

1:02:33.278 --> 1:02:35.080
Now go.

1:02:35.114 --> 1:02:37.015
Naptime.

1:03:27.599 --> 1:03:31.937
Okay, let's see
where the boys are.

1:03:33.205 --> 1:03:34.641
Probably down here...

1:03:34.674 --> 1:03:37.376
- Boo!
- Whoa, Job, what are you doing?

1:03:37.409 --> 1:03:38.645
Where's your dad?

1:03:38.678 --> 1:03:41.380
He's over there raking.

1:03:41.413 --> 1:03:43.415
All by himself?

1:03:43.449 --> 1:03:45.551
Yeah, with the wind,
it's not working.

1:03:45.584 --> 1:03:49.354
Job, go and help him.

1:03:49.388 --> 1:03:51.290
Oh, here,
I'll help you, honey.

1:03:51.323 --> 1:03:53.058
A few sweeps, we're done.

1:03:55.527 --> 1:03:58.130
After this,
I think I need a beer, okay?

1:04:00.199 --> 1:04:02.067
What about with my hands
sweeping it?

1:04:02.100 --> 1:04:03.168
Well, that's good.

1:04:03.202 --> 1:04:04.570
You get the ones that blow away.

1:04:04.603 --> 1:04:06.438
And Sasha, you've never been
to the fair before?

1:04:06.472 --> 1:04:09.274
- Um, no, not really.
- No?

1:04:09.308 --> 1:04:11.310
Maybe once when I was littler,

1:04:11.343 --> 1:04:13.612
- but I can't remember.
- You don't remember it?

1:04:13.646 --> 1:04:15.214
I love these chips.

1:04:15.247 --> 1:04:17.015
- Do you want one?
- No.

1:04:17.049 --> 1:04:18.718
Okay.

1:04:18.751 --> 1:04:20.687
Hey, we're about to do
the Ferris wheel here!

1:04:20.720 --> 1:04:23.422
- Our annual trip to the fair!
- Smile!

1:04:23.455 --> 1:04:25.390
All right, wave again! Bye!

1:04:25.424 --> 1:04:27.559
Come on, come on,
let's go, let's go, come on!

1:04:30.395 --> 1:04:32.431
Wait up!

1:04:34.734 --> 1:04:35.601
You out of breath?

1:04:35.635 --> 1:04:37.503
No, I know, I know,
I need to cut back

1:04:37.536 --> 1:04:39.571
on the nachos at night.

1:04:39.605 --> 1:04:41.273
I'm not sure what those are.

1:04:51.250 --> 1:04:52.384
You've gotta get this,
all right?

1:04:52.417 --> 1:04:54.353
- What are you doing?
- He'd bite my entire arm off,

1:04:54.386 --> 1:04:56.088
and I want it on the camera.

1:04:56.121 --> 1:04:58.557
- Yup.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

1:04:58.590 --> 1:05:00.058
No, you're not gonna do that.

1:05:00.092 --> 1:05:01.694
Do not do that.

1:05:01.728 --> 1:05:03.462
At least do not
get your sleeve wet.

1:05:03.495 --> 1:05:04.363
Oh, my gosh.

1:05:04.396 --> 1:05:06.398
I can't believe
you're doing this.

1:05:06.431 --> 1:05:07.667
Oh, my gosh, it's coming.

1:05:07.700 --> 1:05:08.701
Oh, my gosh, it's...

1:05:08.735 --> 1:05:11.169
Oh, he took it!

1:05:11.203 --> 1:05:13.438
That was scary!

1:05:13.472 --> 1:05:15.073
- Okay, I want to.
- Come on, Job.

1:05:15.107 --> 1:05:17.476
You can do it.

1:05:17.509 --> 1:05:18.610
Just take it, take it.

1:05:19.779 --> 1:05:21.213
Oh, my God.

1:05:23.148 --> 1:05:24.483
Where are you guys?

1:05:24.516 --> 1:05:27.386
We're gonna be late for church!

1:05:29.221 --> 1:05:32.391
What are you all doing?

1:05:40.198 --> 1:05:42.200
I can't believe
you're wearing that.

1:05:42.234 --> 1:05:43.636
You know, it's vintage.

1:05:43.670 --> 1:05:46.138
Besides, it's cool!

1:05:46.171 --> 1:05:47.707
Yeah, okay.

1:05:47.740 --> 1:05:49.107
Come on, Job, let's go.

1:05:49.141 --> 1:05:50.409
Come on, bring your Bible.

1:05:50.442 --> 1:05:53.345
We've gotta go to church.
Come on.

1:05:53.378 --> 1:05:55.113
Wake him up!

1:05:55.147 --> 1:05:56.615
Honey!

1:06:01.654 --> 1:06:03.488
Oh, yeah.

1:06:03.522 --> 1:06:05.658
That's right, that's right,
you're right.

1:06:05.692 --> 1:06:06.558
He's about to get hung,

1:06:06.592 --> 1:06:07.894
and the guy up in the hill
with the gun

1:06:07.927 --> 1:06:09.227
is gonna shoot the rope.

1:06:10.897 --> 1:06:12.765
Here it is, look.

1:07:02.815 --> 1:07:03.816
Hey.

1:07:04.851 --> 1:07:06.618
Hi.

1:07:06.653 --> 1:07:10.355
I, uh... I just wanted to see
how you're doing.

1:07:10.389 --> 1:07:11.891
I'm okay.

1:07:13.693 --> 1:07:16.763
Um, I brought you something.

1:07:20.733 --> 1:07:22.200
How We Met.

1:07:22.234 --> 1:07:24.536
Job, Benjamin.

1:07:24.569 --> 1:07:27.807
Can I sit here? Sure.

1:07:27.840 --> 1:07:28.908
The End.

1:07:30.342 --> 1:07:32.444
This is really bad.

1:07:32.477 --> 1:07:34.312
Oh.

1:07:34.346 --> 1:07:35.580
But I like it.

1:07:37.282 --> 1:07:39.251
I want to show you something.

1:07:45.692 --> 1:07:47.927
I've been working on this
for a few weeks.

1:07:51.496 --> 1:07:53.298
It's about this hero

1:07:53.331 --> 1:07:56.334
whose home gets destroyed
in a flood.

1:07:56.368 --> 1:07:58.503
Everything he's known,

1:07:58.537 --> 1:08:00.405
it's gone now.

1:08:00.439 --> 1:08:02.541
So he travels the wasteland

1:08:02.574 --> 1:08:04.844
and battles all these obstacles

1:08:04.877 --> 1:08:10.415
so that, in the end,
he can find a new place to live.

1:08:10.449 --> 1:08:11.884
This is fantastic, Benjamin.

1:08:11.918 --> 1:08:14.619
You should get this published
or something!

1:08:14.654 --> 1:08:16.321
Thanks.

1:08:21.393 --> 1:08:22.929
I'm sorry for being an asshole.

1:08:24.964 --> 1:08:29.001
And I know there's
some awkwardness between us.

1:08:31.003 --> 1:08:34.006
It'll probably stick around
for a while.

1:08:34.040 --> 1:08:35.675
But...

1:08:37.810 --> 1:08:40.278
I don't know, I thought
maybe if I brought it up,

1:08:40.312 --> 1:08:41.214
it would make it less awkward,

1:08:41.246 --> 1:08:44.917
but I think I just
made it more awkward.

1:08:48.054 --> 1:08:49.722
I'm sorry.

1:08:50.957 --> 1:08:52.892
Why are you apologizing?

1:08:52.925 --> 1:08:55.427
You don't have anything
to apologize for.

1:08:55.460 --> 1:08:57.395
- But I...
- Benjamin.

1:08:59.699 --> 1:09:00.666
You're gay.

1:09:02.334 --> 1:09:05.337
I'm not sure.

1:09:05.370 --> 1:09:07.673
That's fine, too!

1:09:07.707 --> 1:09:09.374
Have you told anyone else?

1:09:10.710 --> 1:09:12.444
No.

1:09:12.477 --> 1:09:15.047
- I don't...
- Hey.

1:09:15.081 --> 1:09:17.884
You don't need to have
all the answers right now.

1:09:17.917 --> 1:09:21.754
We'll figure it out together.

1:09:21.788 --> 1:09:23.355
Okay?

1:09:24.891 --> 1:09:27.459
Okay.

1:09:27.492 --> 1:09:31.363
So, where does this hero
settle down?

1:09:31.396 --> 1:09:33.065
You'll have to read the sequel
to find out.

1:09:33.099 --> 1:09:34.934
There's gonna be a sequel?

1:09:34.967 --> 1:09:37.402
Oh, sweet!

1:10:03.461 --> 1:10:05.430
Hey! I have one of these, too!

1:10:19.111 --> 1:10:20.445
Um...

1:10:22.748 --> 1:10:25.885
I guess I wanted to apologize,

1:10:25.918 --> 1:10:29.922
but, um, is there anything
you wanna say?

1:10:36.863 --> 1:10:39.031
Look, I'm sorry for what I said,

1:10:39.065 --> 1:10:42.902
but Benjamin is going through
a lot right now and...

1:10:42.935 --> 1:10:44.737
Why do you care what I think?

1:10:53.145 --> 1:10:57.884
My, um... mom said

1:10:57.917 --> 1:10:59.118
she didn't start
going to church

1:10:59.151 --> 1:11:00.920
until she met my dad.

1:11:03.089 --> 1:11:04.156
And I've gone
ever since I was a kid,

1:11:04.190 --> 1:11:05.925
I mean, it's all I've known.

1:11:10.029 --> 1:11:11.063
But now I...

1:11:13.165 --> 1:11:16.903
I don't know
what to believe in.

1:11:16.936 --> 1:11:20.139
I've been figuring
a lot of things out.

1:11:26.578 --> 1:11:28.681
But there are some things
I know for sure.

1:11:37.857 --> 1:11:41.060
Well, I think I said
everything I wanted to,

1:11:41.093 --> 1:11:45.865
so I guess I'll just leave.

1:11:55.241 --> 1:11:57.944
Did you know my...

1:11:57.977 --> 1:11:59.779
my dad's name was Robert?

1:12:01.147 --> 1:12:02.514
Just a...

1:12:03.581 --> 1:12:05.517
Just a fun fact.

1:12:18.831 --> 1:12:20.266
- Why are you doing this?
- You're a real asshole,

1:12:20.299 --> 1:12:21.767
- you know that?
- Well, at least I don't talk

1:12:21.801 --> 1:12:23.568
about my dead dad all the time.

1:12:23.601 --> 1:12:26.706
- Job!
- Dear God.

1:12:26.739 --> 1:12:28.674
I'm so sorry.

1:12:28.708 --> 1:12:31.143
It's all right, my child.

1:12:31.177 --> 1:12:32.979
God?

1:12:33.012 --> 1:12:34.046
Is that you?

1:12:34.080 --> 1:12:36.782
Of course, Job.

1:12:36.816 --> 1:12:38.017
That's not how you pronounce...

1:12:38.050 --> 1:12:41.087
Go in peace
and follow the path of light

1:12:41.120 --> 1:12:43.956
of what is right and not wrong,

1:12:43.990 --> 1:12:48.260
so you may be a blessing
to all the good, uh,

1:12:48.294 --> 1:12:50.896
good will that will change
the lives of those around you

1:12:50.930 --> 1:12:52.198
for the better.

1:12:52.231 --> 1:12:54.066
Amen.

1:12:54.100 --> 1:12:55.267
Hey.

1:12:55.301 --> 1:12:57.236
Stay outta my story.

1:12:57.269 --> 1:12:58.838
I couldn't help myself.

1:12:58.871 --> 1:13:00.740
And what a story it's been!

1:13:00.773 --> 1:13:02.775
Yeah, I mean,
but there's only one part left,

1:13:02.808 --> 1:13:04.243
and you already know
what that is.

1:13:04.276 --> 1:13:06.178
I do?

1:13:06.212 --> 1:13:08.114
Joan of Arc Ate the Steak.

1:13:08.147 --> 1:13:09.581
Opening night.

1:13:15.054 --> 1:13:16.621
It was a packed house.

1:13:16.655 --> 1:13:17.790
Everyone was there.

1:13:30.269 --> 1:13:33.538
My mom was able to make it out,
so that was nice.

1:13:35.074 --> 1:13:38.711
Oh, yeah, Lance was there, too.

1:13:38.744 --> 1:13:40.312
Who is Sasha playing again?

1:13:40.346 --> 1:13:42.681
A head of broccoli.

1:13:56.028 --> 1:13:59.632
There comes a time
where everyone must fight

1:13:59.665 --> 1:14:02.334
for something good,
for something right,

1:14:02.368 --> 1:14:05.738
for something they believe in.

1:14:05.771 --> 1:14:07.605
We live in trying times,

1:14:07.640 --> 1:14:10.643
and although the path forward
may seem unclear...

1:14:10.676 --> 1:14:12.044
Jesus, this sucks.

1:14:12.078 --> 1:14:14.313
Shh!

1:14:14.346 --> 1:14:16.782
It's like VeggieTales, it's...

1:14:31.730 --> 1:14:34.133
We should always look
towards the future.

1:14:34.166 --> 1:14:35.801
Let us think ahead.

1:14:35.835 --> 1:14:37.636
Yes, we must!

1:14:37.670 --> 1:14:39.171
We'll all have to start
working together

1:14:39.205 --> 1:14:40.940
sooner or tater.

1:14:44.110 --> 1:14:47.346
With grape power
comes grape responsibility.

1:14:51.317 --> 1:14:53.719
Or else we'll...

1:14:53.752 --> 1:14:57.189
we won't be able
to live like this anymore.

1:14:59.959 --> 1:15:01.293
Something's wrong.

1:15:01.327 --> 1:15:03.162
Yeah.

1:15:03.195 --> 1:15:05.030
Anything else would be
downright bananas!

1:15:05.064 --> 1:15:06.398
There are traitors among us!

1:15:06.432 --> 1:15:09.034
Traitors? Oh, my heavens!

1:15:12.905 --> 1:15:15.774
I pray for the dawn
of a new era.

1:15:15.808 --> 1:15:20.746
Full of love and happiness
and world peace.

1:15:20.779 --> 1:15:25.317
I pray that everyone
can be happy.

1:15:25.351 --> 1:15:26.986
No, no!

1:15:27.019 --> 1:15:28.787
No!

1:15:29.955 --> 1:15:31.891
Nooo!

1:15:41.066 --> 1:15:44.103
Bravo!

1:15:44.136 --> 1:15:46.472
Hey, that was good.

1:15:46.505 --> 1:15:48.240
Is it over?

1:15:48.274 --> 1:15:49.675
It's intermission.

1:15:54.914 --> 1:15:56.215
Hey, where's Sasha?

1:15:56.248 --> 1:15:57.816
I... I don't know.

1:16:05.191 --> 1:16:06.492
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
what's wrong?

1:16:06.525 --> 1:16:07.993
Don't touch me.

1:16:08.027 --> 1:16:10.196
- I just want to make sure...
- Don't touch me.

1:16:11.764 --> 1:16:13.199
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
what happened out there?

1:16:13.232 --> 1:16:14.300
I screwed up, okay?

1:16:14.333 --> 1:16:15.834
What do you want from me?

1:16:15.868 --> 1:16:17.736
I just want to make sure
that you're okay.

1:16:17.770 --> 1:16:18.938
Now you care?

1:16:20.439 --> 1:16:21.840
- Okay...
- Now you want to know

1:16:21.874 --> 1:16:23.375
how I'm doing?

1:16:23.409 --> 1:16:25.077
I'm fantastic, Job.

1:16:25.110 --> 1:16:26.345
- I've never been better.
- Sasha...

1:16:26.378 --> 1:16:28.113
What are you doing
back here, anyway?

1:16:28.147 --> 1:16:30.182
- Okay, listen to me.
- No!

1:16:32.117 --> 1:16:34.053
I'm done.

1:16:34.086 --> 1:16:36.989
I've had enough.

1:16:37.022 --> 1:16:38.057
Okay?

1:16:40.926 --> 1:16:43.162
But the show...

1:16:43.195 --> 1:16:44.196
The show.

1:17:07.987 --> 1:17:10.089
Where is Sasha?

1:17:12.992 --> 1:17:16.362
This thing should've started
like ten minutes ago.

1:17:16.395 --> 1:17:17.963
Yeah.

1:17:27.840 --> 1:17:28.874
Oh, cruel fate!

1:17:28.907 --> 1:17:31.977
Where dirt has come,
where dirt we shall return.

1:17:32.011 --> 1:17:34.313
He was so young!

1:17:34.346 --> 1:17:36.582
He didn't have to die this way.

1:17:36.615 --> 1:17:39.418
Who would do this?

1:17:52.531 --> 1:17:54.333
Are you kidding me, Sasha?

1:17:54.366 --> 1:17:55.501
You're on!

1:18:11.984 --> 1:18:13.552
Look at the stars.

1:18:15.888 --> 1:18:19.858
In times of distress,
they will always be there.

1:18:21.527 --> 1:18:25.531
Yes, I can see them now.

1:18:27.199 --> 1:18:29.368
How does that make you feel?

1:18:33.072 --> 1:18:36.208
It makes me sad.

1:18:38.911 --> 1:18:40.312
Anything else?

1:18:44.083 --> 1:18:48.620
It... it makes me lonely.

1:19:07.306 --> 1:19:08.974
You don't have to be alone.

1:19:25.692 --> 1:19:27.593
We'll make it
through this together.

1:19:40.740 --> 1:19:42.141
What the hell are you doing?

1:19:42.174 --> 1:19:44.143
Where is Sasha?

1:20:10.068 --> 1:20:12.471
I harbor no resentments.

1:20:12.504 --> 1:20:15.174
I only wish for the day
that we can break bread

1:20:15.207 --> 1:20:19.144
and find a path to peace
together.

1:20:25.384 --> 1:20:27.720
So that was that.

1:20:29.188 --> 1:20:31.423
Well, I suppose so.

1:20:31.457 --> 1:20:33.325
What happened
to Robert and Alice?

1:20:33.358 --> 1:20:35.527
Really, not much.

1:20:38.430 --> 1:20:42.000
Everything just
went back to normal.

1:20:49.508 --> 1:20:52.311
And that's basically the story.

1:20:52.344 --> 1:20:54.446
That's it?

1:20:54.480 --> 1:20:56.081
We aren't on bad terms,
I think,

1:20:56.114 --> 1:20:59.786
but we're not good friends
or anything.

1:21:01.620 --> 1:21:03.656
We exist in separate worlds.

1:21:03.690 --> 1:21:05.390
You know?

1:21:08.327 --> 1:21:10.229
That's just how it is.

1:21:11.363 --> 1:21:13.666
I see.

1:21:13.700 --> 1:21:15.334
Well, what about Sasha?

1:21:15.367 --> 1:21:17.469
Oh, I'm actually gonna
hang out with her right now.

1:21:19.571 --> 1:21:24.209
Well, Job, this has been
quite the confession.

1:21:24.243 --> 1:21:25.544
Yes, it has been.

1:21:25.577 --> 1:21:27.579
But hey, I warned you!

1:21:27.613 --> 1:21:29.481
Well, that's the joy of life,
is it not?

1:21:29.515 --> 1:21:32.618
I mean, not having
all of the answers,

1:21:32.652 --> 1:21:34.520
sometimes we think
we know what we're doing

1:21:34.553 --> 1:21:37.623
and then God steps in
to correct us.

1:21:39.157 --> 1:21:40.492
But I know you'll do fine.

1:21:42.427 --> 1:21:44.530
Thanks, Father Bentley.

1:21:48.166 --> 1:21:50.435
Hey, hey, hey, one more thing.

1:21:50.469 --> 1:21:51.771
Is this yours?

1:21:54.273 --> 1:21:57.409
I have never seen that pen
in my entire life.

1:21:59.244 --> 1:22:02.347
Okay. I'll see you around.

1:22:03.482 --> 1:22:05.584
Godspeed.

1:22:05.617 --> 1:22:08.320
Hey, say hi to Maria for me!

1:22:34.647 --> 1:22:36.649
Okay, what have you got?

1:22:38.317 --> 1:22:39.585
First draft.

1:22:39.618 --> 1:22:41.654
Ah, cool!

1:22:43.155 --> 1:22:44.423
Interesting title.

1:22:44.456 --> 1:22:46.291
Yeah.

1:22:46.325 --> 1:22:48.460
Just take a look at it
when you get a chance.

1:22:57.235 --> 1:22:58.004
Do you know why I think people

1:22:58.037 --> 1:23:01.273
want to become
English teachers?

1:23:01.306 --> 1:23:02.441
It's so they can
make their students

1:23:02.474 --> 1:23:04.209
read Huckleberry Finn out loud

1:23:04.242 --> 1:23:07.479
without telling them what to do
about the N-word.

1:23:07.512 --> 1:23:09.682
I'm serious, they don't give
any guidance out there.

1:23:09.716 --> 1:23:11.684
They just let some poor sap
run into an N-word

1:23:11.718 --> 1:23:15.621
and just let him
figure it out, you know?

1:23:15.655 --> 1:23:17.690
I can imagine them
rubbing their hands together

1:23:17.724 --> 1:23:20.325
as some white girl
approaches an N-word,

1:23:20.359 --> 1:23:22.160
holding back chuckles
and laughter

1:23:22.194 --> 1:23:25.632
as she's drowning out there,
you know?

1:23:34.272 --> 1:23:35.842
Thanks for filling in for me.

1:23:35.875 --> 1:23:37.644
Yeah, no problem.

1:23:40.612 --> 1:23:42.180
Look, I...

1:23:42.214 --> 1:23:45.785
- Sasha, you don't have to...
- Just give me a second.

1:23:50.823 --> 1:23:53.558
Look, I tried to keep it
together that night, I did,

1:23:53.592 --> 1:23:55.962
but I just feel
like I've been burning out

1:23:55.995 --> 1:23:57.930
the last few months, and...

1:23:59.832 --> 1:24:02.267
...that was just
a little too much.

1:24:08.473 --> 1:24:11.543
Sometimes I feel like
no one cares about what I want.

1:24:16.649 --> 1:24:19.752
You remember when
we were lost at the fair?

1:24:19.786 --> 1:24:21.988
Sure.

1:24:22.021 --> 1:24:25.725
I was reminded of it recently.

1:24:27.860 --> 1:24:30.930
Anyway, I was so scared that
we couldn't find our parents.

1:24:30.963 --> 1:24:33.465
And I cried, as you know.

1:24:33.498 --> 1:24:34.801
But...

1:24:36.468 --> 1:24:39.271
...you were there.

1:24:39.304 --> 1:24:41.373
And that made me feel
a lot better.

1:24:44.509 --> 1:24:46.411
I hope I can do that for you.

1:24:53.318 --> 1:24:56.588
Okay, Sasha, you were right
from the beginning.

1:24:56.621 --> 1:24:59.291
I was wrong,
I should've listened to you.

1:24:59.324 --> 1:25:01.661
- I am dumb.
- I know.

1:25:04.664 --> 1:25:06.666
And there he is.

1:25:06.699 --> 1:25:08.533
Hey, guys. Sorry I'm late.

1:25:08.567 --> 1:25:09.936
No, you're actually
right on time.

1:25:09.969 --> 1:25:11.003
Oh!

1:25:11.037 --> 1:25:12.939
- Hey.
- Hi.

1:25:12.972 --> 1:25:14.439
Any progress on the comic?

1:25:14.473 --> 1:25:15.540
Just started the third issue.

1:25:15.574 --> 1:25:17.009
Wow! That was fast.

1:25:17.043 --> 1:25:19.478
- It's a lot of fun.
- I'm glad!

1:25:21.814 --> 1:25:24.316
So.

1:25:24.349 --> 1:25:27.053
Here we are.

1:25:27.086 --> 1:25:29.889
Three high school kids.

1:25:29.922 --> 1:25:31.556
Hanging out.

1:25:33.358 --> 1:25:35.327
In a cemetery.

1:25:35.360 --> 1:25:37.596
- Mhm.
- Yup.

1:25:40.967 --> 1:25:42.068
You guys wanna get out of here?

1:25:42.101 --> 1:25:43.636
- Yeah.
- Please.

1:25:47.707 --> 1:25:49.008
Ooh, guys,
you guys are gonna want

1:25:49.041 --> 1:25:50.609
to check out this pen I got.

1:25:50.643 --> 1:25:52.745
- Ooh, a pen.
- Shut up.

1:25:52.779 --> 1:25:56.515
- Can I see it?
- Yeah.

1:25:56.548 --> 1:25:57.717
- It feels nice.
- Yeah, yeah,

1:25:57.750 --> 1:25:59.685
there's like
a nice weight to it.

1:25:59.719 --> 1:26:01.486
I was going to use it
on Sasha's scripts,

1:26:01.520 --> 1:26:02.955
but since you seem
way more into it,

1:26:02.989 --> 1:26:04.589
maybe you want to use it
for one of your comics.

1:26:04.623 --> 1:26:05.557
Hey, you haven't even read
my script yet.

1:26:05.590 --> 1:26:06.659
Yeah, yeah, whatever.

1:26:06.692 --> 1:26:08.627
I could have some good ideas!

1:26:08.661 --> 1:26:10.029
Noah Shark!

1:26:10.062 --> 1:26:11.798
It's like Noah's Ark,

1:26:11.831 --> 1:26:12.865
but there's sharks in it.

1:26:12.899 --> 1:26:14.332
What?

1:26:16.601 --> 1:26:17.937
There are just
sharks everywhere!

1:26:17.970 --> 1:26:19.337
They're just gonna
eat the animals,

1:26:19.371 --> 1:26:21.874
but the old man
has got to protect them.

1:26:21.908 --> 1:26:22.942
Stupid.

1:26:22.975 --> 1:26:24.777
- I think it's funny!
- Thank you!

1:26:24.811 --> 1:26:27.880
See, Benjamin can appreciate
some quality concepts.
