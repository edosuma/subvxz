WEBVTT

00:55.707 --> 00:58.145
Okay, okay.

00:58.188 --> 00:59.711
Eight times!
Eight times!

00:59.755 --> 01:02.192
Pretty accurate.
You should be used to it by now.

01:04.020 --> 01:05.587
<i>But rather</i>
<i>than pay a fair price</i>

01:05.630 --> 01:07.023
<i>for our precious deuterium,</i>

01:07.067 --> 01:08.851
<i>the UNSC leadership on Reach</i>

01:08.894 --> 01:10.418
<i>seek to enslave us.</i>

01:10.461 --> 01:11.680
New deal.

01:11.723 --> 01:12.942
Yeah, let someone else deal.

01:12.985 --> 01:14.552
The Professor has sticky hands.

01:14.596 --> 01:16.206
You saying I cheat?

01:16.250 --> 01:17.729
I'm saying you don't
wash your hands.

01:17.773 --> 01:20.210
My hands are filthy with
the blood UNSC marines.

01:20.254 --> 01:21.864
Speech, Professor.

01:21.907 --> 01:24.258
Regale us with another one
of your war stories.

01:24.301 --> 01:26.477
I've got scars older than you.

01:26.521 --> 01:28.740
- The things I've...
- "...things I've seen."

01:28.784 --> 01:30.568
<i>They've repeatedly sent legions</i>

01:30.612 --> 01:33.484
<i>of marines and their</i>
<i>super weapons, the Spartans,</i>

01:33.528 --> 01:34.790
<i>to crush us.</i>

01:34.833 --> 01:37.271
<i>But war need not be the answer.</i>

01:37.314 --> 01:41.144
<i>And that is why Jin Ha</i>
<i>has sent me</i>

01:41.188 --> 01:45.583
<i>and trusts me to negotiate</i>
<i>an end to this endless war.</i>

01:45.627 --> 01:46.932
Turn that shite off.

01:46.976 --> 01:49.892
<i>As the Bard once wrote,</i>
<i>"Wise--"</i>

01:49.935 --> 01:52.329
Vinsher's a fool,
but he's a dangerous fool,

01:52.373 --> 01:54.070
giving people false hope.

01:54.114 --> 01:55.854
His peace talks will fail,

01:55.898 --> 01:58.205
and the UNSC will come at us
with everything they've got.

01:58.248 --> 01:59.554
You mark me.

01:59.597 --> 02:00.816
You mean Spartans?

02:02.557 --> 02:05.734
Have you seen a Spartan
up close?

02:05.777 --> 02:07.083
I've faced marines.

02:08.519 --> 02:10.130
"I've faced marines."

02:11.653 --> 02:13.394
One Spartan is worth
a hundred marines.

02:13.437 --> 02:15.309
Ah, but, Djanka,

02:15.352 --> 02:18.094
there's another difference
between Spartans and marines.

02:18.138 --> 02:19.400
Mm?

02:19.443 --> 02:20.966
Marines can be killed.

02:24.666 --> 02:26.407
Spartans aren't human.

02:26.450 --> 02:29.279
They're faster,
stronger, smarter.

02:29.323 --> 02:31.281
They cannot be stopped.

02:31.325 --> 02:34.066
They just keep on killing...

02:35.155 --> 02:36.286
without mercy...

02:37.505 --> 02:39.855
till there's nothing left...

02:40.943 --> 02:42.118
to kill.

02:48.951 --> 02:50.605
You in or out?

02:55.479 --> 02:57.220
Jin Ha!

02:57.264 --> 02:59.483
Tell our young one here.

02:59.527 --> 03:01.181
The General knows.

03:01.224 --> 03:04.662
Either Madrigal is free,
or it's not.

03:04.706 --> 03:06.490
There's no middle ground.

03:06.534 --> 03:08.188
Aw, come on!

03:08.231 --> 03:11.147
Oh, you got to be kidding me.
Unbelievable.

03:13.149 --> 03:14.498
Everything okay,
General?

03:15.586 --> 03:17.240
Where's my daughter?

03:17.284 --> 03:19.851
Probably out wandering...

03:19.895 --> 03:21.157
with her friends.

03:22.811 --> 03:24.116
You know Kwan.

03:28.599 --> 03:30.253
- Slow down!

03:30.297 --> 03:32.255
I didn't sign up for this!

03:37.304 --> 03:39.306
I am completely shanked.

03:41.308 --> 03:42.918
This better be worth it, Kwan.

03:42.961 --> 03:45.312
Less talking,
more looking, Cara.

03:45.355 --> 03:47.575
Look, if the General
finds out we left the outpost--

03:47.618 --> 03:49.881
What my father
doesn't know won't kill him.

03:56.671 --> 03:59.239
I told you I'd find it.

03:59.282 --> 04:03.895
Madrigal, the galaxy's highest
concentration of heavy hydrogen.

04:03.939 --> 04:05.810
Power your ships...

04:05.854 --> 04:07.638
and power your drugs.

04:11.425 --> 04:14.950
This is why you have to stay,
Kwan, to find shit like this!

04:14.993 --> 04:16.517
Too bad for you,

04:16.560 --> 04:18.301
soon as I find a way,

04:18.345 --> 04:20.434
I'm getting off
this stupid rock.

04:20.477 --> 04:22.566
Where will you even go, Kwan?

04:22.610 --> 04:24.655
The UNSC owns the galaxy.

04:24.699 --> 04:26.048
She's not gonna leave.

04:26.091 --> 04:27.615
She'd miss us too much.

04:30.531 --> 04:31.749
Doubters first.

04:31.793 --> 04:33.664
- Yes!
- Yeah.

04:33.708 --> 04:34.926
See you on the other side.

04:44.762 --> 04:46.851
Kwan, where are you going?

04:46.895 --> 04:48.766
- Off to plot her escape.

04:48.810 --> 04:50.594
How long before this kicks in?

04:50.638 --> 04:52.901
My brother says
it's pretty quick.

04:56.557 --> 05:00.169
Guys! Wait...!

05:25.977 --> 05:27.370
Knew you would
come to play!

05:27.414 --> 05:30.417
Hey, your face is glowing!

05:31.809 --> 05:33.333
Kwan, where have you been?

05:33.376 --> 05:35.247
We need to get back
to the outpost.

05:35.291 --> 05:36.771
- Why? What's going on?
- There's a ship out there.

05:36.814 --> 05:38.294
- UNSC?
- I don't think so.

05:38.338 --> 05:40.731
Neru, no, I'm serious!
Come on, Faaz!

05:40.775 --> 05:42.385
Kwan...

05:46.868 --> 05:48.783
- Esso!

06:15.244 --> 06:17.202
I don't know. They
should have been here by now.

06:17.246 --> 06:19.204
Kwan Ha.

06:19.248 --> 06:20.423
Red flare!

06:20.467 --> 06:22.294
Flag General Ha!

06:28.910 --> 06:30.259
- General Ha!

06:30.302 --> 06:32.130
Red flare,
north of the outpost!

06:33.480 --> 06:35.177
Seal the pipes!
Get your weapons!

06:47.929 --> 06:49.278
Spread out!

07:08.123 --> 07:09.516
Stay low! Stay low! Stay low!

07:10.647 --> 07:11.561
Stay down!

07:13.345 --> 07:15.478
Right behind you.

07:15.522 --> 07:17.219
- Here!

07:17.262 --> 07:18.176
In position!

07:24.879 --> 07:26.446
Kill the alarm!

07:26.489 --> 07:28.360
Stand by!

07:30.798 --> 07:32.756
Move out! Move out!

07:32.800 --> 07:33.975
Move out!

07:37.369 --> 07:39.371
Papa! Papa!

07:57.868 --> 07:59.479
Do your job!

08:01.176 --> 08:02.525
Get in the line!

08:03.961 --> 08:06.398
Malchin!
Come, come, this way.

08:06.442 --> 08:07.791
Go inside the pipes.

08:07.835 --> 08:09.097
Inside! Inside!

08:09.140 --> 08:10.881
Get on in, get on in!

08:10.925 --> 08:12.579
Move it, move it!

08:12.622 --> 08:13.928
Come on! Come on!

08:13.971 --> 08:15.495
Quick! Quick! Quick!
Go, go, go!

08:25.722 --> 08:26.854
Be ready.

09:25.434 --> 09:26.653
What are those things?

09:26.696 --> 09:28.219
I don't know
what they are.

09:40.405 --> 09:41.842
Papa!

09:41.885 --> 09:42.930
Go!

09:46.934 --> 09:49.850
- Where are you going?
- I have to go. I have to help.

09:49.893 --> 09:51.242
Are we gonna die?

09:53.941 --> 09:55.290
No, of course not.

09:55.333 --> 09:56.857
We're warriors,
aren't we?

09:56.900 --> 09:58.293
- Yeah.
- Stay put. I'll be back, okay?

10:08.085 --> 10:10.087
Take cover!

10:36.113 --> 10:37.898
- Let me in! Let me in!

10:48.386 --> 10:50.084
Kwanya!

10:51.825 --> 10:53.696
Kwanya!

10:59.746 --> 11:01.617
Go! Go! Go!

11:01.661 --> 11:03.750
How many are there?

11:05.012 --> 11:06.578
- Kwan!
- I don't know,

11:06.622 --> 11:08.058
but they have a ship.

11:08.102 --> 11:09.973
Holy Mother of God,
it's all true.

11:10.017 --> 11:11.366
What? What's true?

11:11.409 --> 11:13.847
I thought it was UNSC
propaganda.

11:25.772 --> 11:26.816
A ship!

11:26.860 --> 11:28.905
UNSC!

11:28.949 --> 11:31.081
Take cover!

11:31.125 --> 11:32.517
Oh, shit!

11:41.788 --> 11:43.572
The Spartans.

11:47.228 --> 11:49.534
Spartans!

12:07.509 --> 12:08.771
Silver team, engage.

12:09.859 --> 12:11.556
Taking over watch.

12:37.800 --> 12:40.020
They're helping.
The Spartans are helping!

12:40.063 --> 12:42.370
I never thought
I'd see the day.

12:42.413 --> 12:44.241
- They're on our side now.
- So they are.

12:44.285 --> 12:46.504
So let's fight!

12:51.248 --> 12:52.859
Clearing north quadrant.

13:21.844 --> 13:24.368
Elite cluster,
west quadrant.

14:32.393 --> 14:35.875
Silver team,
clear the perimeter.

14:48.931 --> 14:52.326
Team, I need covering fire.
South quadrant.

15:15.523 --> 15:18.091
Kai, hold your position.

15:19.222 --> 15:20.136
Any time now.

16:00.568 --> 16:01.830
Papa?

16:03.005 --> 16:04.441
Kwanya.

16:09.838 --> 16:11.057
No! No!

16:14.843 --> 16:16.671
No!

16:16.714 --> 16:18.847
No!

16:29.989 --> 16:31.425
No!

17:05.676 --> 17:09.202
Link Command, Silver team.

17:09.245 --> 17:12.205
Covenant forces on planet
Madrigal neutralized.

17:12.248 --> 17:15.295
Twenty Elite warriors killed,
150 civilians.

17:15.338 --> 17:16.687
No survivors.

17:16.731 --> 17:17.906
Wait!

17:19.821 --> 17:22.084
one survivor.

17:22.128 --> 17:24.739
Female. Juvenile.

17:27.089 --> 17:29.570
Silver team commencing
comprehensive search of the area

17:29.613 --> 17:31.354
for enemy landing site.

17:36.229 --> 17:37.665
Wait! Don't just leave!

17:42.365 --> 17:43.801
Papa!

19:53.496 --> 19:55.106
Chief.

19:55.150 --> 19:56.673
Covenant Phantom.

19:59.502 --> 20:01.939
Vannak, Riz, clear that ship.

20:06.117 --> 20:07.423
Hey, Chief.

20:10.600 --> 20:12.036
Kai, on me.

20:43.938 --> 20:45.592
Master Chief 1-1-7

20:45.635 --> 20:47.681
reporting on
the planet Madrigal.

20:47.724 --> 20:49.683
We found the Covenant ship.

20:49.726 --> 20:52.816
Local grid 12-Tango-Zone-Echo.

20:54.470 --> 20:57.081
Now investigating the interior
of a nearby cave.

21:03.044 --> 21:04.437
Assessment report.

21:05.612 --> 21:07.091
Covenant excavation.

21:09.137 --> 21:10.530
Cave network
does not appear

21:10.573 --> 21:12.009
to be a natural formation.

21:14.621 --> 21:17.580
Observing debris consistent
with plasma cutters.

21:23.194 --> 21:25.327
Covenant forces
appear to be excavating

21:25.371 --> 21:27.547
for some kind of object.

21:28.809 --> 21:30.506
Unclear as to its nature.

21:43.389 --> 21:44.433
Retrieving now.

22:29.348 --> 22:30.610
Don't go too far.

22:33.308 --> 22:34.788
Chief!

22:43.536 --> 22:45.364
Chief, sitrep?

22:49.368 --> 22:50.804
- Riz, Vannak,

22:50.847 --> 22:52.936
one Elite approaching
cave entrance.

23:23.489 --> 23:24.968
Master Chief?

23:28.319 --> 23:30.104
You three commandeer
the other ship.

23:30.147 --> 23:32.541
Take it back to Fleetcom
for research and intel.

23:32.585 --> 23:35.892
I'll retrieve the object
and follow in the Condor.

23:35.936 --> 23:37.372
I'll fly with you.

23:37.416 --> 23:39.722
No. Go with the others.

23:41.071 --> 23:42.899
That's not procedure.

23:42.943 --> 23:44.814
Go with the others.

23:45.902 --> 23:47.121
That's an order.

23:47.164 --> 23:48.339
Roger that.

24:22.330 --> 24:24.941
Security access,
Dr. Catherine Halsey.

24:26.552 --> 24:28.728
Madrigal,
Master Chief 1-1-7.

24:31.165 --> 24:33.472
<i>Alien forces</i>
<i>appear to be excavating</i>

24:33.515 --> 24:35.125
<i>for some kind of object.</i>

24:36.866 --> 24:38.520

24:42.568 --> 24:44.352
<i>Retrieving now.</i>

24:53.666 --> 24:55.276
<i>Retrieving now.</i>

25:12.249 --> 25:13.512
<i>Access granted.</i>

25:15.165 --> 25:17.298
A hundred and fifty
dead civilians in Madrigal

25:17.341 --> 25:20.214
is not a good look
for your Spartans, Catherine,

25:20.257 --> 25:21.737
even if they were rebels.

25:21.781 --> 25:24.305
The Covenant wiped out
an entire rebel garrison

25:24.348 --> 25:26.568
before Silver team
could intervene.

25:26.612 --> 25:27.787
We saved one.

25:27.830 --> 25:29.571
1-1-7's bringing her in.

25:29.615 --> 25:33.140
One survivor's not going
to make my job any easier.

25:33.183 --> 25:35.577
The security committee's
looking for an excuse

25:35.621 --> 25:37.231
to cut your funding.

25:39.842 --> 25:43.280
John recovered something
on Madrigal.

25:43.324 --> 25:46.022
Possibly Covenant.

25:46.066 --> 25:48.024
- We'll add it to our collection.
- No, no, no, no.

25:48.068 --> 25:49.852
This...

25:49.896 --> 25:51.506
this is different.

25:53.769 --> 25:55.728
It's like nothing
I've ever seen.

26:01.734 --> 26:03.649
We've been fighting
these alien creatures for years,

26:03.692 --> 26:06.608
and we still have no idea what
they want, where to find them,

26:06.652 --> 26:08.262
or how to beat them.

26:08.305 --> 26:10.351
Command on Earth
want answers.

26:10.394 --> 26:13.484
If that object can tell us
anything about them,

26:13.528 --> 26:16.705
I have a feeling the committee's
concern about dead rebels

26:16.749 --> 26:18.359
will go away.

26:18.402 --> 26:20.317
One more thing.

26:20.361 --> 26:23.364
They want a friendly face
talking to the survivor.

26:23.407 --> 26:25.279
Miranda Keyes
knows Madrigal.

26:25.322 --> 26:27.803
I've asked her
to do the reach-out.

26:27.847 --> 26:29.936
Is that going to be an issue?

26:29.979 --> 26:31.633
No, no, no.

26:31.677 --> 26:34.070
But the Madrigal object
comes straight to my lab

26:34.114 --> 26:36.290
for first analysis
upon arrival.

26:36.333 --> 26:38.597
Alien tech
is Miranda's division.

26:38.640 --> 26:39.815
John found it.

26:39.859 --> 26:41.034
It belongs here.

26:52.654 --> 26:54.917
I told you
that was a nonstarter.

26:54.961 --> 26:57.441
We have paused
active development.

26:58.704 --> 27:00.053
You've paused nothing.

27:00.096 --> 27:02.795
Catherine, your genius
has given us

27:02.838 --> 27:04.840
so much to be thankful for.

27:04.884 --> 27:07.930
Channel that genius
appropriately and legally.

27:07.974 --> 27:10.672
Get rid of that,
and any others.

27:10.716 --> 27:13.066
- Clear?
- Clear.

27:15.024 --> 27:17.287
I've given you a long lead,
Doctor.

27:17.331 --> 27:19.159
Don't hang me with it.

30:32.700 --> 30:33.788
Hey.

30:35.268 --> 30:38.184
Anybody! Please!

30:38.227 --> 30:39.402
Please!

30:40.490 --> 30:43.102
Hey. Hey, you!

30:48.977 --> 30:51.545
Hey! Open the door!

30:53.939 --> 30:54.853
Please!

30:56.332 --> 30:58.378
- Open the door!
- Kwan.

30:58.421 --> 31:00.380
How are you feeling?

31:01.511 --> 31:02.991
Who are you?

31:03.035 --> 31:04.906
I'm Miranda Keyes.

31:04.950 --> 31:07.039
I'm talking to you from
the UNSC headquarters on Reach.

31:08.518 --> 31:10.999
So sorry for your loss, Kwan.

31:11.043 --> 31:13.393
Despite their differences,

31:13.436 --> 31:15.830
the UNSC respected
the way that Jin Ha

31:15.874 --> 31:19.878
stood up for himself
and the people of Madrigal.

31:19.921 --> 31:22.924
Kwan, I'm not a politician.

31:22.968 --> 31:24.752
I spend my time trying
to understand the aliens

31:24.795 --> 31:26.536
that attacked your outpost.

31:26.580 --> 31:29.148
Yours isn't the first planet
to face the Covenant,

31:29.191 --> 31:32.455
and, unfortunately,
it won't be the last.

31:34.631 --> 31:36.198
If we don't all join together...

31:37.939 --> 31:40.594
I don't know how we're going
to stop them.

31:40.637 --> 31:42.509
You could help us
do that.

31:47.122 --> 31:49.168
What does that mean?

31:51.605 --> 31:57.916
If you would upload a few words
to the other colonies,

31:57.959 --> 32:00.483
just explaining what you saw,

32:00.527 --> 32:02.311
the brutality of the Covenant,

32:02.355 --> 32:05.010
the fact that the Spartans
are actually taking them on,

32:05.053 --> 32:07.142
I think that it would go
a long way to putting aside

32:07.186 --> 32:09.536
whatever these politicians
are bickering about

32:09.579 --> 32:11.755
and helping us focus
on the real war.

32:16.804 --> 32:20.547
My dad spent his life
trying to free us from you...

32:22.244 --> 32:24.203
until the day of his murder.

32:25.900 --> 32:27.902
How can you ask me to...

32:27.946 --> 32:29.948
to go on camera and--?

32:29.991 --> 32:31.688
- I understand. I'm not trying--
- No, no, no.

32:31.732 --> 32:33.429
It's a great idea.

32:34.865 --> 32:36.215
Yeah, let's do it.

32:40.219 --> 32:42.003
What if I say the UNSC

32:42.047 --> 32:44.440
sent a bunch of Spartans
to attack us.

32:44.484 --> 32:45.920
That's not true.

32:45.964 --> 32:48.792
They killed over
a hundred innocent people.

32:50.011 --> 32:51.143
Children.

32:52.448 --> 32:54.015
And then...

32:54.059 --> 32:56.104
and then you kidnapped me
to force me to say

32:56.148 --> 32:57.627
it was all the aliens.

32:57.671 --> 32:59.194
Kwan, the entire encounter
was recorded.

32:59.238 --> 33:01.414
You people can make video
look like anything.

33:03.111 --> 33:06.201
We've seen your Spartan
propaganda broadcasts.

33:06.245 --> 33:08.551
You think the Outer Colonies
don't see through that?

33:09.988 --> 33:12.381
And when they hear
my version,

33:12.425 --> 33:15.080
you can forget about unity
or whatever.

33:16.864 --> 33:19.127
Those other colonies
are going to run from the UNSC

33:19.171 --> 33:21.608
as fast as they can.

33:23.871 --> 33:25.177
What is it you want?

33:27.048 --> 33:29.442
Independence for Madrigal.

33:32.271 --> 33:33.881
That's what my dad wanted.

33:35.535 --> 33:37.537
So that's what I want.

33:40.366 --> 33:41.715
Yeah.

33:44.631 --> 33:45.806
Get some rest.

33:47.547 --> 33:48.939
I'll see you on Reach.

33:56.599 --> 33:58.645
Getting
a red light on hatch 4.

33:58.688 --> 34:00.255
Commander Shepherd,
you are requested

34:00.299 --> 34:02.214
at the Skillian Response Center.

34:23.409 --> 34:24.932
<i>Retrieving now.</i>

34:30.068 --> 34:31.982
Biometrics
are all over the map.

34:33.897 --> 34:37.162
Body temperature is up.
It's up.

34:37.205 --> 34:39.207
Lymphatics,
they're ignited.

34:39.251 --> 34:42.993
Elevated activity
in his hypothalamus

34:43.037 --> 34:44.647
and pineal glands.

34:44.691 --> 34:46.432
Look, look.

34:46.475 --> 34:50.088
The energy pulse is stimulating
his connective tissue.

34:50.131 --> 34:52.829
All this from contact
with a piece of rock.

34:54.614 --> 34:56.224
Has he said anything?

34:56.268 --> 34:57.486
No.

34:59.401 --> 35:01.142
How long until they're back?

35:01.186 --> 35:03.710
- Better part of a day.
- Okay.

35:03.753 --> 35:05.320
Sierra 1-1-7.

35:05.364 --> 35:06.974
<i>Connecting.</i>

35:07.017 --> 35:09.716
<i>Dr. Halsey. Status report.</i>

35:09.759 --> 35:13.154
Returning from Twenty-Three
Librae, Planet Madrigal,

35:13.198 --> 35:15.113
with a single survivor.

35:15.156 --> 35:17.245
Covenant disarmed,
one escapee.

35:17.289 --> 35:20.596
And your neural lace metrics,
any anomalies?

35:26.341 --> 35:27.560
I saw things...

35:28.778 --> 35:30.128
when I touched the object.

35:33.348 --> 35:34.610
What kind of things?

35:37.352 --> 35:38.658
Woods.

35:38.701 --> 35:39.876
A white dog.

35:41.269 --> 35:42.923
A family.

35:47.057 --> 35:48.363
A family?

35:53.629 --> 35:55.065
That's what it felt like.

35:59.069 --> 36:00.201
Okay.

36:01.376 --> 36:02.943
John...

36:02.986 --> 36:05.337
<i>until we know more</i>
<i>about that object,</i>

36:05.380 --> 36:07.165
<i>I'd like you to keep</i>
<i>your distance from it.</i>

36:09.515 --> 36:11.125
Copy that.

36:12.518 --> 36:15.042
You've been through a lot, John.

36:15.085 --> 36:18.480
So, whatever's happened,
you get yourself back here

36:18.524 --> 36:20.700
and we will sort it out, okay?

36:22.354 --> 36:24.007
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

36:24.051 --> 36:25.748
- Sierra out.

36:25.792 --> 36:28.186
I need live updates every
ten minutes streamed to me,

36:28.229 --> 36:31.580
and when he lands,
you bring him straight here.

36:31.624 --> 36:33.103
Yes, ma'am.

36:34.279 --> 36:35.454
Okay.

36:53.080 --> 36:55.343
Please, open the door.
Please--

37:03.177 --> 37:05.048
- <i>Identification.</i>

37:05.092 --> 37:08.008
Master Chief, Petty Officer,
John 1-1-7.

37:09.488 --> 37:11.098
What are you doing?

37:11.141 --> 37:13.318
Scanning the integrity
of all bio interfaces

37:13.361 --> 37:15.320
for evidence
of abnormalities.

37:18.105 --> 37:19.715
That your way of saying
you don't feel well?

37:19.759 --> 37:20.934
<i>Checking systems.</i>

37:27.810 --> 37:29.334
Yes.

37:33.076 --> 37:34.861
You gonna live?

37:34.904 --> 37:36.689
Yes.

37:37.994 --> 37:39.169
Hey.

37:41.520 --> 37:44.218
There anything to eat
on this ship?

38:01.757 --> 38:05.761
Heard you played politician
today with the rebel girl.

38:05.805 --> 38:07.328
Dad, I tried.

38:08.764 --> 38:10.375
I sucked up my pride,
and I really--

38:10.418 --> 38:11.724
I gave it my best.

38:11.767 --> 38:13.639
I believe you.

38:13.682 --> 38:17.599
Selling Dr. Halsey's Spartans
to a rebel, of all people.

38:17.643 --> 38:20.602
As if Halsey'd ever
do a thing to promote me.

38:20.646 --> 38:23.562
- That's not entirely fair.
- Please don't. Don't defend her.

38:23.605 --> 38:25.868
She's done nothing
but throw roadblocks in my way.

38:25.912 --> 38:28.349
Halsey's always been
single-minded.

38:28.393 --> 38:30.438
Work is the only thing
that matters.

38:30.482 --> 38:32.353
I made my peace with that
a long time ago.

38:34.007 --> 38:35.487
It's nothing personal.

38:35.530 --> 38:37.663
"Nothing personal"
isn't a great excuse

38:37.706 --> 38:39.317
when it's your mom.

38:39.360 --> 38:42.320
Blood, ocular fluid,
glandular extracts,

38:42.363 --> 38:44.322
and bone samples
sent to external lab...

38:44.365 --> 38:46.672
You know,
you are a lot like her.

38:47.760 --> 38:49.152
Ouch.

38:49.196 --> 38:51.198
I mean that as a compliment.

38:53.156 --> 38:54.506
Anyway...

38:54.549 --> 38:56.551
I'm guessing the UNSC

38:56.595 --> 39:00.381
isn't about to grant Madrigal
complete independence.

39:00.425 --> 39:01.730
Mnh-mnh.

39:01.774 --> 39:03.732
So what happens now,
to the girl?

39:05.430 --> 39:06.996
That's what I came over here
to tell you.

39:08.215 --> 39:09.521
Tell me what?

39:09.564 --> 39:12.219
Kwan Ha was badly wounded

39:12.262 --> 39:15.309
in the alien attack
on Madrigal.

39:15.353 --> 39:19.400
Despite our best efforts,
she succumbed to her injuries.

39:19.444 --> 39:20.836
I-I spoke to her,
and she was fine.

39:20.880 --> 39:22.577
What--? What injuries?

39:24.100 --> 39:25.624
Dad.

39:28.670 --> 39:30.716
You didn't order an Article 72.

39:33.109 --> 39:35.285
Came from up top.

39:35.329 --> 39:38.201
I wanted you
to hear it from me.

39:38.245 --> 39:40.073
Well, then you're okay
with this?

39:40.116 --> 39:41.857
It's not about being okay.

39:41.901 --> 39:44.120
No, it's about keeping
the deuterium flowing,

39:44.164 --> 39:45.557
regardless of the cost.

39:47.428 --> 39:49.648
- It is not that simple.
- It is that simple.

39:49.691 --> 39:51.345
It's-it's an Article 72.

39:52.694 --> 39:55.218
We're murdering
a teenage girl...

39:57.090 --> 39:58.744
and I'm complicit.

39:58.787 --> 40:01.094
We're in a war, Miranda.

40:01.137 --> 40:02.965
The future of humanity--

40:03.009 --> 40:04.358
What's the point
in saving humanity

40:04.402 --> 40:06.447
if we're going to give up
our own?

40:06.491 --> 40:11.104
Sometimes you have to make hard
choices to get good results.

40:15.108 --> 40:17.589
Now who's sounding like Halsey?

40:32.821 --> 40:34.040
You don't eat?

40:35.302 --> 40:37.478
Didn't see anything I liked.

40:37.522 --> 40:39.045
Yeah?

40:39.088 --> 40:40.394
What is it you like?

40:41.917 --> 40:44.137
Nuts. Bolts.

40:44.180 --> 40:45.617
Microchips.

40:49.229 --> 40:50.839
- That was a joke.
- Yeah, no, I get it.

40:52.188 --> 40:53.363
Hilarious.

40:56.802 --> 40:58.543
You ever take that thing off?

41:00.153 --> 41:02.285
All of my diagnostic command
and control systems

41:02.329 --> 41:03.939
run through here.

41:03.983 --> 41:05.332
I need it.

41:07.682 --> 41:10.511
Master Chief, huh?

41:10.555 --> 41:12.600
You know we've actually met
before today.

41:13.819 --> 41:15.734
When was this?

41:18.388 --> 41:19.999
When you killed my mother.

41:24.133 --> 41:25.570
She was at a meeting.

41:28.398 --> 41:32.185
Outer Colonists getting together
to talk about how the UNSC

41:32.228 --> 41:34.840
was stripping us
of all our natural resources.

41:34.883 --> 41:36.755
But before they got
into all that,

41:36.798 --> 41:39.235
you and three other
Spartans showed up,

41:39.279 --> 41:42.717
responding to an insurrectionist
bomb threat.

41:42.761 --> 41:45.067
But, see, that never made
much sense, because why would--?

41:45.111 --> 41:46.504
Why would insurrectionists

41:46.547 --> 41:48.462
blow up a meeting
for insurrectionists?

41:51.030 --> 41:52.205
Yeah.

41:54.686 --> 41:56.905
We were ordered
to eliminate the organizer.

41:58.472 --> 42:00.039
And the orders changed.

42:01.388 --> 42:02.868
To what?

42:02.911 --> 42:04.957
The assembled were deemed
an imminent threat.

42:05.000 --> 42:06.959
My mom seemed like
an imminent threat to you?

42:07.002 --> 42:08.787
What I can see on the ground
may not reflect

42:08.830 --> 42:10.528
the entirety
of the situation.

42:10.571 --> 42:11.616
- What does that mean?
- Sometimes...

42:11.659 --> 42:13.574
others know things I do not.

42:13.618 --> 42:15.837
It ever occur to you that it
might work the other way around?

42:19.058 --> 42:20.799
Then you question everything?

42:20.842 --> 42:22.322
And someone told you
that's bad?

42:25.151 --> 42:26.544
Of course they did.

42:30.199 --> 42:31.940
It's funny, I...

42:33.725 --> 42:36.075
I don't look at pictures
of my mom that often, but...

42:37.163 --> 42:38.294
you...

42:40.383 --> 42:41.950
you're everywhere.

42:43.865 --> 42:45.998
Can't turn around without
staring at an uplink

42:46.041 --> 42:48.391
about humanity's
best weapon.

43:02.188 --> 43:03.450
What is your name?

43:04.538 --> 43:06.496
Kwan Ha.

43:09.891 --> 43:11.545
How much longer
are we stuck in here?

43:13.591 --> 43:16.028
ETA is still several hours.

43:16.071 --> 43:17.769
And then what?

43:21.207 --> 43:22.600
That's still being
worked out.

43:46.885 --> 43:48.800
So, what's the problem?

43:48.843 --> 43:50.366
Roll it back for her.

43:50.410 --> 43:51.672
Yes, ma'am.

43:56.982 --> 43:58.287
What's he doing?

43:58.331 --> 43:59.462
Wait for it.

44:05.773 --> 44:08.907
Captain, does Master Chief
know the girl is Article 72?

44:08.950 --> 44:12.040
Of course. It would have been
communicated to him.

44:12.084 --> 44:15.130
Dr. Halsey, what's wrong
with 1-1-7?

44:15.174 --> 44:18.003
Nothing, it's just
a neurochemical glitch

44:18.046 --> 44:20.962
caused by a power surge
to his prefrontal cortex.

44:21.006 --> 44:22.747
It's not nothing.

44:22.790 --> 44:25.619
Rather than execute the rebel
as ordered,

44:25.663 --> 44:28.187
he has decided to kill
the video feed from his ship.

44:28.230 --> 44:29.841
What's going on?

44:32.060 --> 44:34.149
I think he's having memories.

44:34.193 --> 44:36.151
What?

44:36.195 --> 44:37.500
Of?

44:37.544 --> 44:39.415
His parents.

44:39.459 --> 44:41.853
I thought you'd sealed
those memories.

44:41.896 --> 44:44.246
He's not even certain
that they're his memories.

44:44.290 --> 44:46.379
For the moment,
they're just visions.

44:46.422 --> 44:48.686
Then why violate procedure?

44:50.688 --> 44:51.950
I don't know.

44:54.300 --> 44:56.432
Not knowing why
a walking killing machine

44:56.476 --> 44:58.565
is doing what it's doing

44:58.608 --> 45:00.785
is a risk that cannot
be taken.

45:00.828 --> 45:02.743
I agree completely,

45:02.787 --> 45:05.746
which is precisely why
the Cortana system could prove--

45:05.790 --> 45:08.401
There is no Cortana system,
Catherine.

45:08.444 --> 45:11.447
No cloning, no Cortana.
Is that clear?

45:12.927 --> 45:15.364
Now get your Spartan
under control.

45:17.366 --> 45:18.977
- What's happening?

45:24.373 --> 45:25.548
Something is...

45:26.636 --> 45:28.029
wrong.

45:28.073 --> 45:29.683
I can't breathe.

45:32.599 --> 45:34.079
What are you doing?

45:36.995 --> 45:38.692
Ship's oxygen levels dropping.

45:39.780 --> 45:41.216
I need to...

45:50.922 --> 45:52.358
Kwan.

45:52.401 --> 45:54.577
Take down the oxygen
in 1-1-7's suit.

45:54.621 --> 45:56.928
Don't drop the O2 below 40.
I want him unconscious,

45:56.971 --> 45:58.364
- not dead.
- Yes, ma'am.

45:58.407 --> 45:59.669
Can the girl survive this?

45:59.713 --> 46:01.106
I thought you wanted her dead.

46:11.377 --> 46:12.900
- It's over there.
- Here.

46:12.944 --> 46:15.816
It's holding at 40%.
He's unconscious.

46:36.271 --> 46:38.404
I'm getting a report of access
to panel Alpha 1-6.

46:38.447 --> 46:41.189
If he's unconscious, how come
he's opening panels in the ship?

46:41.233 --> 46:43.931
- What's in A-1-6?
- Atmosphere controls.

46:47.152 --> 46:48.980
<i>Oxygen levels</i>
<i>are returning to normal.</i>

46:50.982 --> 46:52.897
What sort of weapons
is the ship carrying?

46:52.940 --> 46:54.550
John is not going to fire on us.

46:54.594 --> 46:56.161
I think it's safe to say
you don't know

46:56.204 --> 46:57.902
what Master Chief is going to do
at this point.

46:57.945 --> 47:00.078
Ship's flying on AI.
We have control.

47:00.121 --> 47:01.470
I'll send an escort of Pelicans.

47:01.514 --> 47:03.342
I need more than an escort,
Captain.

47:03.385 --> 47:04.647
Put out the alarm.

47:04.691 --> 47:06.214
Scramble everyone
to landing bay,

47:06.258 --> 47:07.999
full squadron protocol.

47:08.042 --> 47:09.827
Due respect,
we are talking about

47:09.870 --> 47:11.916
our most important
military asset.

47:11.959 --> 47:13.526
We are not taking any chances.

47:13.569 --> 47:15.093
Let me investigate.
I'll speak to John,

47:15.136 --> 47:16.877
and whatever influence
this object's--

47:16.921 --> 47:19.097
Question one more order, Doctor,

47:19.140 --> 47:21.055
and you can watch
from your lab.

47:26.582 --> 47:29.455
Come on! Let's go! Move!

47:29.498 --> 47:31.370
- Move out!
- Let's go! Let's go!

47:31.413 --> 47:32.719
Move your ass out! Go!

47:32.762 --> 47:34.764
Move, move, move!

47:41.249 --> 47:42.598
Clear.

48:31.256 --> 48:32.997
<i>Silver team,</i>

48:33.040 --> 48:35.825
<i>Master Chief</i>
<i>has been compromised</i>

48:35.869 --> 48:39.003
<i>by the object you located</i>
<i>on Madrigal.</i>

48:39.046 --> 48:42.920
<i>Because of this, he's no longer</i>
<i>able to comply with orders.</i>

48:42.963 --> 48:45.139
<i>You've been dispatched</i>
<i>by Fleet Command</i>

48:45.183 --> 48:47.402
<i>to neutralize him.</i>

48:47.446 --> 48:49.361
- I'm superseding those orders.
- Move!

48:49.404 --> 48:51.015
Whatever he's experiencing,

48:51.058 --> 48:53.800
there are other
available solutions.

48:53.843 --> 48:55.410
When that ship lands,

48:55.454 --> 48:58.936
I want you to secure
and protect Master Chief

48:58.979 --> 49:01.460
from anyone who actively
threatens his life,

49:01.503 --> 49:03.070
whatever the circumstances.

49:03.114 --> 49:05.768
Engage friendlies, ma'am?

49:05.812 --> 49:07.901
If they go after Chief,
they're not friendlies.

49:07.945 --> 49:10.295
Correct, Dr. Halsey?

49:10.338 --> 49:11.949
Correct.

49:37.800 --> 49:39.237
Kwan.

49:39.280 --> 49:40.716
Don't move.

49:40.760 --> 49:42.109
You're gonna need
to listen to me.

49:42.153 --> 49:43.763
What did you do to me?

49:43.806 --> 49:45.678
Stop messing
with that stuff.

49:45.721 --> 49:48.202
UNSC changed the air mixture,
not me.

49:48.246 --> 49:50.030
Why should I trust you?

49:51.553 --> 49:53.512
I am trying to get control
of the flight.

49:53.555 --> 49:55.035
I will kill you.

50:03.217 --> 50:05.306
This is Mark Six
Mjolnir armor.

50:05.350 --> 50:07.526
The outer layer
is enhanced titanium.

50:07.569 --> 50:09.136
You won't even dent it.

50:46.260 --> 50:47.870
If you want me dead...

50:49.133 --> 50:50.569
you'll need to aim up here.

50:52.614 --> 50:54.703
What just happened?

50:56.444 --> 50:57.967
I think he just took off
his helmet.

51:04.365 --> 51:07.412
- What are you doing?
- Trying to help you.

51:07.455 --> 51:09.109
If this ship lands,

51:09.153 --> 51:11.416
they will remove you
and execute you.

51:18.466 --> 51:20.251
They told you this?

51:22.166 --> 51:24.733
And you just decided
to help me?

51:28.346 --> 51:30.087
Why would a Spartan do that?

51:33.438 --> 51:34.830
I don't know.

51:37.790 --> 51:40.140
Get me thermal imaging
on the Condor.

51:40.184 --> 51:41.750
Right away.

51:56.548 --> 51:58.724
So what now?

52:02.989 --> 52:04.904
We need to work fast.

52:04.947 --> 52:08.342
There's
a weapon signature on the girl.

52:08.386 --> 52:12.955
Did your Spartan just give
an insurgent a rifle?

52:14.392 --> 52:15.871
Green Deck, two minutes
till touchdown.

52:15.915 --> 52:17.090
Two minutes!

52:22.226 --> 52:24.924
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

52:31.887 --> 52:33.324
Open ECAM panel two.

52:33.367 --> 52:35.630
Disconnect the AI
autopilot fail-safe.

52:35.674 --> 52:38.111
- Autopilot what?
- ECAM panel two!

52:38.155 --> 52:39.547
That's how we get control
of the ship.

52:41.114 --> 52:42.855
- Rip out the cables to the FMS!
- Which cables?

52:42.898 --> 52:44.683
I need to disconnect
the stabilizer servos

52:44.726 --> 52:47.251
at the same time, otherwise
we lose complete control.

52:57.652 --> 52:58.871
I can't! They're stuck!

52:58.914 --> 53:00.612
Must work faster, Kwan!

53:00.655 --> 53:01.656
I'm trying!

53:05.269 --> 53:06.879
Go! Go! Go!

53:09.795 --> 53:11.188
Shit!

53:18.630 --> 53:20.501
<i>...now in manual mode.</i>

53:20.545 --> 53:23.069
<i>You are now in manual mode.</i>

53:25.680 --> 53:27.465
He's disabled the AI.

53:27.508 --> 53:29.075
Flying manually, ma'am.

53:30.772 --> 53:33.166
What are we waiting for?
I thought you had control.

53:33.210 --> 53:35.516
I do. Hang on.

53:35.560 --> 53:37.562
Captain...

53:37.605 --> 53:39.607
This is Keyes.
Pulse the ship

53:39.651 --> 53:41.609
before he can load
fire controls.

53:41.653 --> 53:42.567
Knock it down!

53:53.404 --> 53:55.536
Let's go! Move!

53:58.365 --> 53:59.714
Move! Flanking starboard!

54:00.889 --> 54:02.543
Halt! Cover me!

54:02.587 --> 54:03.501
Ready!

54:10.377 --> 54:11.944
Bravo Two, at the door!

54:13.424 --> 54:15.164
Hold your line!

54:15.208 --> 54:16.427
In your ranks!

54:16.470 --> 54:17.993
Hold your section!

54:18.037 --> 54:19.299
What do we do?

54:22.259 --> 54:23.608
Prepare to breach!

54:23.651 --> 54:25.305
What do we do?

54:25.349 --> 54:27.873
- All engines dead.
- No response.

54:27.916 --> 54:29.570
Drop the girl.

54:31.093 --> 54:32.965
And if he makes a move,
drop him too.

54:35.707 --> 54:36.882
Shit.

54:38.927 --> 54:41.582
Master Chief, please tell me
you have a plan.

54:49.895 --> 54:51.157
Placing charges!

55:01.950 --> 55:03.169
Master Chief!

55:42.339 --> 55:44.297
- Want to see?
- Of course.

55:52.392 --> 55:53.828
What just happened?

55:53.872 --> 55:55.308
Debasement status?

56:07.059 --> 56:08.974
<i>A.I. is disengaged.</i>

56:10.062 --> 56:11.759
What did you just do?

56:11.803 --> 56:13.413
Switching to auxiliary power.

56:13.457 --> 56:14.719
What was that?

56:25.947 --> 56:26.905
Strap in.
