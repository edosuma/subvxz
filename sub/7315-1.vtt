WEBVTT

00:03.069 --> 00:05.437
No kiss for your father?
What are you doing here?

00:05.439 --> 00:08.073
Vance: Arash kazmi is
eli's new vevak contemporary.

00:08.075 --> 00:10.042
Kazmi's first visit
to the u.S.,

00:10.044 --> 00:11.343
Eli just happens to be here.

00:11.345 --> 00:13.278
(automatic gunfire)

00:13.280 --> 00:14.680
Kazmi:
<i>How could eli be dead?</i>

00:14.682 --> 00:16.482
I was the one who
approached him

00:16.484 --> 00:17.583
About forging peace

00:17.585 --> 00:19.184
<i>To begin with.</i>

00:20.420 --> 00:22.187
What are you
not telling me, tom?

00:22.189 --> 00:24.189
Cia took out
kazmi that night.

00:24.191 --> 00:26.025
Special agent
leroy jethro gibbs,

00:26.027 --> 00:29.028
You've manipulated evidence
and you've obstructed justice.

00:29.030 --> 00:31.263
Overnight delivery,
left him on the front porch.

00:31.265 --> 00:33.232
<i>Label says it was shipped from</i>
<i>riyadh, saudi arabia.</i>

00:33.234 --> 00:35.367
<i>Meet navy seal</i>
<i>lieutenant chad mcbride.</i>

00:35.369 --> 00:37.703
I have got thousands
of documents

00:37.705 --> 00:39.071
Ready to indict
leroy jethro gibbs.

00:39.073 --> 00:40.239
Parsons,

00:40.241 --> 00:41.507
<i>You should know</i>
<i>that gibbs' team</i>

00:41.509 --> 00:43.542
<i>Handed in their resignations.</i>

00:43.544 --> 00:46.111
We pull it off,
this could all go away.

00:46.113 --> 00:46.745
Where's gibbs?

00:46.747 --> 00:48.147
On a mission for jsoc.

00:49.149 --> 00:50.716
Gibbs, do it.

00:56.322 --> 00:58.624
(gunshot)

01:04.230 --> 01:06.365
Hello.

01:08.234 --> 01:10.202
Good to see you.

01:10.204 --> 01:12.704
Sir, I need a moment.

01:12.706 --> 01:14.840
Richard, go home.

01:14.842 --> 01:17.276
I figured you'd be drowning
your sorrows by now.

01:17.278 --> 01:19.778
Well, I know that
secretary jarvis is inside,

01:19.780 --> 01:22.181
And I would like five minutes
with the both of you

01:22.183 --> 01:23.649
To discuss ncis.

01:23.651 --> 01:26.218
This is not the place.
My job was

01:26.220 --> 01:27.820
To clean up the navy's
investigative branch.

01:27.822 --> 01:29.555
And I've been sidelined

01:29.557 --> 01:31.690
By some half-assed
classified mission

01:31.692 --> 01:35.360
Because you guys want
gibbs to play cowboy.

01:37.097 --> 01:40.199
Homeland is not the only
agency authorizing this.

01:40.201 --> 01:42.234
Secretary jarvis,

01:42.236 --> 01:44.303
The director of the cia
both agree

01:44.305 --> 01:45.504
The mission takes precedence.

01:45.506 --> 01:48.307
But my case was
a political slam dunk.

01:48.309 --> 01:50.676
Gibbs is being given
a "get out of jail free" card.

01:50.678 --> 01:52.511
It's wrong.
What's wrong is

01:52.513 --> 01:54.813
Me continuing this conversation
for one more minute.

01:54.815 --> 01:58.283
Your tunnel-visioned,
stubborn determination

01:58.285 --> 01:59.651
Is getting in the way.

01:59.653 --> 02:01.620
Well, at least tell me,

02:01.622 --> 02:04.123
What is so important
that one assignment

02:04.125 --> 02:07.326
Can trump a career
of rule breaking?

02:07.328 --> 02:09.228
The less you know, the better.

02:09.230 --> 02:11.430
And believe me,
I'm doing you a favor.

02:11.432 --> 02:13.565
I'll get to the bottom of this.

02:13.567 --> 02:16.401
There's a line
in the sand, parsons.

02:16.403 --> 02:18.237
Don't cross it.

02:29.782 --> 02:33.352
(people clamoring,
car alarm wailing)

03:09.589 --> 03:12.624
Jimmy:
This is so weird.

03:12.626 --> 03:14.760
"weird" is but one
of the many adjectives

03:14.762 --> 03:16.628
I could apply to
these circumstances,

03:16.630 --> 03:18.530
Mr. Palmer.

03:18.532 --> 03:21.767
If only that creep parsons
wasn't pushing his witch hunt,

03:21.769 --> 03:24.269
None of this
would've happened.

03:24.271 --> 03:25.537
That creep, as you
call him, abby,

03:25.539 --> 03:27.806
Did not bomb the
hotel ballroom.

03:27.808 --> 03:30.309
Yeah, but gibbs
and the others,

03:30.311 --> 03:35.747
Yeah, well, we have a
long night ahead of us.

03:35.749 --> 03:38.450
I didn't know the secnav,
but I heard he was married.

03:38.452 --> 03:40.919
Had kids.
Abby:
Yeah.

03:40.921 --> 03:42.487
He and director vance
were really close.

03:42.489 --> 03:44.256
Why didn't we do more

03:44.258 --> 03:47.559
To stop parsons'
investigation?

03:47.561 --> 03:50.662
Like a sit-in
or a... Or a hunger strike.

03:50.664 --> 03:52.931
Yeah, I'm no good
at hunger strikes.

03:52.933 --> 03:55.000
I get really light-headed around
4:00 if I don't have a snack.

03:55.002 --> 03:58.437
What we must do is to stop
feeling sorry for ourselves.

03:58.439 --> 04:00.672
There's work to do,
and right now,

04:00.674 --> 04:02.541
Those responsible have
the upper hand.

04:02.543 --> 04:05.010
Secretary jarvis
and those who have fallen

04:05.012 --> 04:07.412
Are counting on us.

04:08.548 --> 04:09.881
Gibbs, you're here.

04:09.883 --> 04:11.350
Unless I'm seeing things.

04:11.352 --> 04:12.918
You guys got work to do?

04:12.920 --> 04:14.419
Yes, we do, jethro.

04:15.588 --> 04:17.556
And we are eager to do it.

04:17.558 --> 04:19.725
Shall we?

04:19.727 --> 04:21.526
Vance:
<i>Thank you.</i>

04:25.999 --> 04:28.567
That was the
secretary of defense.

04:28.569 --> 04:30.836
In addition to
jarvis's death,

04:30.838 --> 04:32.604
Tom morrow was
just rushed into surgery.

04:32.606 --> 04:33.739
He may lose a leg.

04:33.741 --> 04:36.341
Anyone claiming
responsibility yet?

04:36.343 --> 04:39.878
The secretary of the u.S. Navy
is dead, captain.

04:39.880 --> 04:41.713
I don't believe anybody
would be fool enough

04:41.715 --> 04:43.482
To welcome that
death wish.

04:43.484 --> 04:44.916
Response?

04:44.918 --> 04:48.053
The white house wants answers
by any means necessary.

04:48.055 --> 04:50.756
Intel thinks this is just a
warning shot across the bow.

04:50.758 --> 04:54.693
That the main event is
still to come.

04:54.695 --> 04:56.928
It's something to
look forward to.

04:56.930 --> 04:58.730
Gibbs, this may also be related

04:58.732 --> 05:00.799
To navy lieutenant mcbride's
murder.

05:00.801 --> 05:03.368
Wayne: We believe the
lieutenant got too close

05:03.370 --> 05:05.070
To indentifying
a new terror cell.

05:05.072 --> 05:06.672
Combine the bomb tonight

05:06.674 --> 05:09.074
And mcbride's radioactive
remains, it's...

05:09.076 --> 05:13.478
Jsoc will be handling
its own investigation.

05:13.480 --> 05:15.414
But nobody would suspect
your involvement

05:15.416 --> 05:17.015
While you're
under close d.O.D. Scrutiny.

05:17.017 --> 05:19.618
Mcbride's mission
originated in iran.

05:19.620 --> 05:23.322
Finding his killer
would be a start.

05:23.324 --> 05:25.490
We have an informant
in abyaneh.

05:25.492 --> 05:27.559
I can try reaching out.

05:28.628 --> 05:31.830
Nobody's forcing you
to do this, gibbs.

05:31.832 --> 05:35.500
Doing my job, director.

I should be at work.

07:27.815 --> 07:28.814
I can help.

07:28.816 --> 07:29.815
Tim, you can't.

07:29.817 --> 07:31.550
Not until you're reinstated.

07:31.552 --> 07:32.951
Yeah, but this isn't right.

07:32.953 --> 07:34.886
There's agents working
around the clock.

07:34.888 --> 07:36.788
Maybe I should call vance.

07:36.790 --> 07:39.858
Maybe tony's heard something.

07:39.860 --> 07:41.526
Look.

07:41.528 --> 07:43.762
I could get into a lot of
trouble for telling you this.

07:43.764 --> 07:45.664
But...

07:45.666 --> 07:47.098
But what?

07:47.100 --> 07:48.834
More than one
source of intel

07:48.836 --> 07:51.470
Says the device used
wasn't middle eastern.

07:52.638 --> 07:54.739
(whispers):
It was american.

07:54.741 --> 07:56.608
Single individual or group?

07:56.610 --> 07:57.909
I don't know.

07:57.911 --> 08:00.645
I need to go.

08:00.647 --> 08:01.680
You don't even
have a badge.

08:01.682 --> 08:02.581
I-I can...

08:02.583 --> 08:04.549
At least talk to abby.

08:05.651 --> 08:07.552
Okay, mcgee, let's talk.

08:07.554 --> 08:09.087
Abby. Hey.

08:09.089 --> 08:10.622
You've met delilah, right?

08:11.591 --> 08:12.691
Yes.

08:12.693 --> 08:13.758
Hi.

08:14.560 --> 08:15.927
Uh, you want a coffee, espresso?

08:16.896 --> 08:18.196
So, mcgee,

08:18.198 --> 08:22.000
I came down here after
last night's horror show

08:22.002 --> 08:23.535
To make sure you're okay.

08:23.537 --> 08:25.637
I had a feeling that
you wouldn't come in.

08:25.639 --> 08:27.739
Well, abby, I'm not
an agent anymore.

08:27.741 --> 08:30.675
You'll always be
an agent, mcgee.

08:30.677 --> 08:32.711
I also wanted
to tell you

08:32.713 --> 08:34.179
That gibbs is headed
out of town.

08:34.181 --> 08:36.014
Out of town where?

08:36.016 --> 08:37.616
Um...

08:37.618 --> 08:39.251
(whispers):
Can she be trusted?

08:39.253 --> 08:42.687
I have a higher security
clearance than any of you.

08:42.689 --> 08:43.955
So did mata hari.

08:44.757 --> 08:45.790
Abby.

08:45.792 --> 08:46.858
Okay, um...

08:46.860 --> 08:48.960
Well, I'm gonna
go back to work.

08:48.962 --> 08:51.229
Um, I've got a ton of
evidence from last night

08:51.231 --> 08:53.598
To go through.
Uh, but it was...

08:53.600 --> 08:55.800
Mm, nice to...

08:55.802 --> 08:58.803
To see you both or...

09:01.807 --> 09:04.543
Awkward.

09:04.545 --> 09:07.145
Where would gibbs be going?

09:12.151 --> 09:13.885
Hey.
(door closes)

09:13.887 --> 09:16.655
I was on my way to work,
thought I'd stop by

09:16.657 --> 09:18.290
Before you left.

09:18.292 --> 09:20.625
You don't drive
this way to work, leon.

09:21.761 --> 09:23.628
President said
he'd be calling

09:23.630 --> 09:24.963
Clayton's wife
this morning.

09:24.965 --> 09:27.566
I wanted to get
there first.

09:30.736 --> 09:32.737
Jarvis did the job proud.

09:32.739 --> 09:36.174
He was a good boss.

09:36.176 --> 09:37.809
Better friend.

09:37.811 --> 09:41.780
Gibbs, I'm not sure how much
more of this I can take.

09:41.782 --> 09:44.149
Drive to school, leon.

09:44.151 --> 09:45.750
Go hug your kids.

09:45.752 --> 09:48.653
I'm concerned about your trip.

09:48.655 --> 09:52.157
After what happened to secnav,
I'm tempted to ground you.

09:52.159 --> 09:55.293
After what happened to secnav...

09:55.295 --> 09:57.762
How can I stay?

09:59.332 --> 10:01.733
Captain wayne's informant

You got to keep in mind, I know
my way around d.C. Politics,

13:27.541 --> 13:30.008
But this is different.

13:30.010 --> 13:32.544
The players are different.

13:32.546 --> 13:34.879
And I'm positive
that ncis is being set up.

13:37.349 --> 13:40.585
Sending you out here was not
about lieutenant mcbride.

13:40.587 --> 13:43.888
It was about separating you
from your team.

13:47.860 --> 13:51.496
I reached out to one of
lieutenant mcbride's coworkers,

13:51.498 --> 13:53.498
Jsoc in iraq,

13:53.500 --> 13:55.867
A lieutenant kagen.

13:55.869 --> 13:57.535
I think we both
might be interested

13:57.537 --> 14:00.405
In what he has to say.

14:02.374 --> 14:04.108
I don't get you.

14:06.579 --> 14:09.547
I watched people die
in that hotel.

14:09.549 --> 14:12.851
If I've learned
one thing, gibbs,

14:12.853 --> 14:14.586
It's that sometimes people do
the wrong thing

14:14.588 --> 14:16.020
For the right reason.

14:16.022 --> 14:18.857
Speak for yourself.

14:18.859 --> 14:21.559
I am.

14:29.068 --> 14:31.169
They were all out of
apple fritters, mr. Palmer,

14:31.171 --> 14:33.538
So you have to make do
with this.

14:33.540 --> 14:35.173
It's a bear claw.

14:38.577 --> 14:40.879
Where's mr. Palmer?
Who are you?!

14:40.881 --> 14:44.449
This room is for
authorized personnel only.

14:44.451 --> 14:46.651
So unless I see some
credentials, I must insist...

14:46.653 --> 14:48.152
(grunting)

14:51.590 --> 14:52.991
Who are you?!

14:53.926 --> 14:54.525
Call security!

14:58.665 --> 15:01.633
Who needs security?
(chuckles)

15:01.635 --> 15:03.101
Tie him up.

15:07.339 --> 15:09.274
Sure, I knew mcbride.

15:09.276 --> 15:11.209
We worked together on a few ops.

15:11.211 --> 15:13.578
He's a good guy.
How's he doing?

15:13.580 --> 15:15.079
Mcbride's dead, lieutenant.

15:15.081 --> 15:18.249
You already knew that.

15:25.324 --> 15:26.357
It's classified, sir.

15:26.359 --> 15:29.327
I'm not supposed
to say anything.

15:29.329 --> 15:31.596
I heard he died,
but what happened?

15:31.598 --> 15:33.398
Was hoping you
could tell us.

15:33.400 --> 15:35.533
I'm sorry. I don't follow.

15:35.535 --> 15:37.368
His last assignment--
how long was he here?

15:37.370 --> 15:39.404
24 hours, tops.

15:39.406 --> 15:41.673
It's not a lot of time.

15:41.675 --> 15:43.107
Well, his mission
was cancelled.

15:43.109 --> 15:44.976
He got orders
to return stateside.

15:44.978 --> 15:47.378
He was jazzed; he wanted
to get back to his wife.

15:47.380 --> 15:51.082
You see mcbride board the plane
to go home, lieutenant?

15:51.084 --> 15:52.083
No, sir.

15:52.085 --> 15:54.686
And got his own ride back
to the airfield.

15:54.688 --> 15:57.288
Why?

16:00.492 --> 16:02.593
(keys clink on table)

16:02.595 --> 16:03.594
(sighs)

16:03.596 --> 16:05.964
All right, kate, listen up.

16:05.966 --> 16:08.599
The little girl down the hall's
gonna feed you while I'm gone.

16:08.601 --> 16:10.735
Maybe I'll bring you something
back from israel.

16:10.737 --> 16:13.671
Don't give me the fish eye.

16:13.673 --> 16:15.440
I know what I'm doing.

16:15.442 --> 16:17.308
Well, maybe it's not
the brightest idea,

16:17.310 --> 16:21.279
But we're not coworkers anymore,
so all bets are off.

16:21.281 --> 16:23.648
Where's that taxi?

16:23.650 --> 16:25.717
(cell phone dings)

16:29.555 --> 16:32.390
Little impatient, aren't we?

16:42.568 --> 16:45.036
(silenced gunfire)

17:03.756 --> 17:05.390
I appreciate it, sir,

17:05.392 --> 17:08.359
But there are rules about
drinking on the job.

17:08.361 --> 17:10.194
New badge, new rules.

17:10.196 --> 17:14.432
Need you to lay low
till we get a handle on this.

17:14.434 --> 17:17.168
Well, I was just hanging out
in my apartment.

17:17.170 --> 17:19.037
I can't lay a lot lower
than that.

17:19.039 --> 17:21.406
And you never saw
the shooter?

17:23.342 --> 17:25.043
Well, I was pretty busy

17:25.045 --> 17:27.545
Trying to keep
my brain matter intact.

17:27.547 --> 17:29.580
And you were on your way
to the airport.

17:29.582 --> 17:31.749
Personal trip.

17:31.751 --> 17:33.284
To israel?

17:33.286 --> 17:35.253
I'll travel for good hummus.

17:37.189 --> 17:39.490
Does agent david know
you've been delayed?

17:39.492 --> 17:42.427
She does.

17:42.429 --> 17:45.263
I also told mcgee
to keep his eyes open.

17:47.199 --> 17:49.434
We have a man
in interrogation.

17:49.436 --> 17:52.837
Dr. Mallard found him sniffing
around, knocked him out.

17:52.839 --> 17:54.605
Ducky did?
Mm-hmm.

17:54.607 --> 17:56.674
K.O. With a full ten-count.

17:56.676 --> 17:59.744
Finish your drink,
agent dinozzo.

17:59.746 --> 18:01.212
I'll have somebody
come get you

18:01.214 --> 18:02.713
As soon as your
protection detail is ready.

18:02.715 --> 18:04.582
Sir,

18:04.584 --> 18:07.085
Instead of wasting
dorneget's time,

18:07.087 --> 18:09.520
What if I just hang around here

18:09.522 --> 18:12.790
As a visitor,
doing purely "visiting" things?

18:12.792 --> 18:15.593
We could use the company.

18:17.596 --> 18:20.798
(door opens, closes)

18:22.101 --> 18:24.669
I must say, our victim appears

18:24.671 --> 18:26.637
Markedly smaller than he did

18:26.639 --> 18:30.241
When mr. Palmer and I
pummeled him into next week.

18:32.144 --> 18:36.781
Today we met danger head-on,
anthony, and emerged victorious.

18:38.784 --> 18:42.386
Is it me,
or does standing here

18:42.388 --> 18:44.122
On the sidelines
feel like...

18:44.124 --> 18:46.491
Torture.

18:46.493 --> 18:49.193
I thought vance said
he was headed straight in.

18:49.195 --> 18:51.596
I'd like a few minutes
with this clown.

18:51.598 --> 18:52.897
Warm him up.

18:52.899 --> 18:54.765
Without a badge?

18:54.767 --> 18:58.302
I'm starting to miss that thing.

19:01.306 --> 19:05.676
Building security has you
signed in as victor cheng,

19:05.678 --> 19:07.578
Former computer specialist
with the fbi.

19:07.580 --> 19:12.250
Money's better
in the private sector.

19:12.252 --> 19:13.618
You were fired from the bureau.

19:13.620 --> 19:16.687
And yet someone granted
you access to my building.

19:16.689 --> 19:18.456
Why?

19:18.458 --> 19:20.725
I got a call.

19:20.727 --> 19:24.562
There's an ncis I.D.
And 20k waiting in an envelope

19:24.564 --> 19:26.697
If I sneak in here
to access your database.

19:26.699 --> 19:29.867
Details about the shrapnel
taken from secnav.

19:29.869 --> 19:31.502
I couldn't access it remotely

19:31.504 --> 19:34.572
Because, uh, some guy
named mcgee

19:34.574 --> 19:35.940
Built a firewall.

19:35.942 --> 19:37.575
Guess you agent types
are smarter than you look.

19:37.577 --> 19:39.310
Who do you work for?!

19:40.279 --> 19:41.612
I told you,
I-I don't know.

19:41.614 --> 19:43.648
Koreans? The chinese?

19:44.750 --> 19:45.850
I need an answer!

19:45.852 --> 19:49.554
(phone ringing)

19:49.556 --> 19:51.322
What is it?

19:52.291 --> 19:53.858
I'll be right there.

19:58.630 --> 20:00.598
(door closes)

20:00.600 --> 20:01.732
Leon!

20:01.734 --> 20:04.569
I made a new friend
along the way.

20:04.571 --> 20:07.672
Enemies closer, gibbs?

20:07.674 --> 20:09.640
Well, parsons is
working for us now.

20:09.642 --> 20:11.609
Well, do tell.

20:11.611 --> 20:13.211
There was no mission.

20:13.213 --> 20:16.647
Lieutenant chad mcbride was
sent to iran as a decoy.

20:16.649 --> 20:18.849
Parsons: Director vance,
we believe mcbride

20:18.851 --> 20:20.585
Returned to the United States.

20:20.587 --> 20:23.721
But not just his head,
all of him. Alive.

20:23.723 --> 20:25.489
Someone wanted
to make it look like

20:25.491 --> 20:26.624
The iranians were responsible?

20:26.626 --> 20:27.992
Leon, I know you're
shorthanded,

20:27.994 --> 20:29.794
But we need you
to connect the dots.

20:29.796 --> 20:31.729
All right,
I'll get miss sciuto on it.

20:31.731 --> 20:33.831
See if we can pinpoint
where mcbride was killed.

20:33.833 --> 20:35.933
We're on the next
transport home.

20:35.935 --> 20:37.001
Parsons, too?

20:38.337 --> 20:40.638
What do you want me
to do, leave him here?

20:42.841 --> 20:44.809
(keyboard clacking)

20:44.811 --> 20:48.713
(snoring)

20:48.715 --> 20:51.449
Tony:
Stop it.

20:51.451 --> 20:53.751
Stop it! Stop it!

20:53.753 --> 20:56.420
(grunts)

20:56.422 --> 20:57.655
Ziva?

20:57.657 --> 20:59.657
What, are you taking
your frustrations out

20:59.659 --> 21:02.426
On a poor little keyb...?

21:04.896 --> 21:06.497
You're not her.

21:06.499 --> 21:09.267
Uh, no, sir. I am murray.

21:09.269 --> 21:11.402
Uh, it's nice to meet you,
former agent dinozzo.

21:11.404 --> 21:13.037
Jimmy:
He's the new I.T. Guy.

21:13.039 --> 21:14.705
He works with kevin.

21:16.908 --> 21:18.976
This is a very weird dream.

21:18.978 --> 21:21.812
You're wide awake, tony,
and you're just in time

21:21.814 --> 21:24.749
To see the second string
in full effect.

21:24.751 --> 21:27.985
Well, I suppose there are
other people that would

21:27.987 --> 21:30.788
Technically be considered more
of a second string, but murray

21:30.790 --> 21:32.056
Just joined the
I.T. Department,

21:32.058 --> 21:34.759
And I took the liberty
of mastering the clicker.

21:34.761 --> 21:37.662
Show me what you got,
autopsy gremlin.

21:38.764 --> 21:43.301
Murray managed to confirm
the intruder's... Story.

21:43.303 --> 21:44.702
"victor cheng was recently fired

21:44.704 --> 21:47.605
From the federal bureau
of investigation."

21:47.607 --> 21:49.774
Nice typeface.
He already told us that.

21:49.776 --> 21:53.344
I know. But thanks to murray,
we know exactly when and why.

21:53.346 --> 21:54.378
Go.

21:54.380 --> 21:56.714
Uh, 2010, uh,

21:56.716 --> 21:58.749
Cheng was caught moonlighting
as a hack for hire.

21:58.751 --> 22:00.718
I am currently trying
to find out

22:00.720 --> 22:01.919
Who gave him an ncis I.D.

22:01.921 --> 22:04.922
Are you not using
contractions?

22:04.924 --> 22:06.691
Pardon?

22:06.693 --> 22:07.925
(groans)

22:07.927 --> 22:09.427
All right, what else?

22:10.829 --> 22:13.597
Jimmy:
Someone has been trying to crack

22:13.599 --> 22:15.700
Ncis's private files
from the outside.

22:17.636 --> 22:19.804
I don't like
the swirly font!

22:19.806 --> 22:21.706
I can read, palmer.

22:21.708 --> 22:24.642
Whoever they are already
accessed our cell phone data.

22:24.644 --> 22:26.744
Which files were
compromised?

22:26.746 --> 22:30.548
Looks like they were mostly
after former personnel.

22:30.550 --> 22:33.551
Get me coffee.

22:34.353 --> 22:35.720
(snaps fingers)

22:35.722 --> 22:37.621
(phone ringing)

22:39.725 --> 22:41.726
Tony, hey.
I'm heading over to ncis.

22:41.728 --> 22:44.729
I'm already here, tim.
I spent the night.

22:44.731 --> 22:46.764
Huh. Just like old times, huh?

22:46.766 --> 22:47.932
Listen,
they're tracking your cell.

22:47.934 --> 22:49.533
Ditch it, get a cab.

22:49.535 --> 22:51.135
Copy that.

22:56.808 --> 22:58.376
Oh, boy.

22:58.378 --> 22:59.744
(tires screech)

22:59.746 --> 23:00.811
Oh!

23:00.813 --> 23:02.747
Mcgee, get in the car!

23:02.749 --> 23:04.815
Agent fornell, this isn't about
your ex-wife again, is it?

23:04.817 --> 23:06.917
Just get in the damn car.

23:06.919 --> 23:08.853
We got him. We're on our way.

23:12.824 --> 23:14.992
(door closes)

23:15.994 --> 23:18.763
A hell of a place
for a meeting.

23:18.765 --> 23:21.098
Who lives like this,
martha stewart?

23:21.100 --> 23:23.934
Well, the towels are martha.

23:23.936 --> 23:24.835
That's it.

23:24.837 --> 23:26.804
Tony, what happened?

23:26.806 --> 23:28.506
Tim, I decided to remodel.

23:28.508 --> 23:30.141
I'm going mid-century mob hit.

23:30.143 --> 23:31.909
Gibbs walked into a trap.

23:31.911 --> 23:34.845
Dinozzo almost got killed.

23:34.847 --> 23:36.147
Special agent fornell
has offered

23:36.149 --> 23:37.948
To enlighten us
on recent events.

23:41.686 --> 23:44.789
You ever hear of a terrorist
wack-job named benham parsa?

23:44.791 --> 23:46.891
What kind of name
is benham parsa?

23:46.893 --> 23:48.926
Fornell:
He's a young extremist.

23:48.928 --> 23:51.962
He just claimed responsibility
for killing secnav.

23:51.964 --> 23:55.966
Parsa is the son of slain
parents from karachi, pakistan.

23:55.968 --> 23:57.701
He's still a kid.
He's ticked off.

23:57.703 --> 23:58.969
No fear.

23:58.971 --> 24:01.705
Scary because he really
doesn't give a damn.

24:01.707 --> 24:04.008
Parsa started a new terror cell.

24:04.010 --> 24:06.110
About a year ago,
we got wind

24:06.112 --> 24:09.046
That he was brokering
private business deals

24:09.048 --> 24:12.183
Between terrorists
and u.S. Companies.

24:12.185 --> 24:13.818
What kind of deals?

24:13.820 --> 24:15.853
Well, every year,
billions are spent

24:15.855 --> 24:18.522
Rebuilding damage done
by criminal acts.

24:18.524 --> 24:20.458
Blow something up,
boost the economy.

24:20.460 --> 24:23.794
More jobs in construction,
security even.

24:23.796 --> 24:26.864
And who is parsa reaching out to
to help make these deals?

24:26.866 --> 24:29.767
A handful of american
business types.

24:29.769 --> 24:30.901
Traitors.

24:30.903 --> 24:33.737
Mbas and bad guys
working together.

24:33.739 --> 24:35.806
We're all searching for names.

24:35.808 --> 24:39.677
Planned destruction can close
some very, very sweet deals.

24:39.679 --> 24:41.178
Somebody's got to rebuild.

24:41.180 --> 24:43.047
Gordon gekko meets bin laden.

24:44.049 --> 24:45.683
Why target ncis?

24:45.685 --> 24:48.085
Because they don't think
you'll play ball.

24:48.087 --> 24:50.054
They're right.

24:53.058 --> 24:55.159
Does homeland know about this?

24:57.529 --> 24:59.597
From day one, director.

25:04.002 --> 25:06.804
Leon, come in.

25:09.074 --> 25:10.975
Did you hear?

25:10.977 --> 25:13.911
I'm keeping my leg.

25:13.913 --> 25:16.113
Tell me you didn't know
anything about benham parsa.

25:16.115 --> 25:19.283
It's all tragic,
reprehensible.

25:19.285 --> 25:22.019
So you knew about
the business deals?

25:22.021 --> 25:23.921
There's no proof
of any transactions.

25:23.923 --> 25:25.155
It's all hearsay.

25:25.157 --> 25:26.957
There's nothing to link anyone
to anything.

25:26.959 --> 25:30.861
Tom, tell me you didn't set
this whole thing in motion.

25:33.031 --> 25:35.132
For heaven's sakes, leon,
look at me.

25:35.134 --> 25:37.301
I've dedicated my life
to this country.

25:37.303 --> 25:39.670
I know the lines
get blurred sometimes,

25:39.672 --> 25:42.139
But I... I would never
condone an attack.

25:42.141 --> 25:44.074
There's a lot of money in play.

25:44.076 --> 25:47.678
How dare you make
that accusation.

25:47.680 --> 25:49.713
Somebody's trying
to wipe out my team!

25:49.715 --> 25:51.582
They tried to kill me, too!

25:54.886 --> 25:57.988
Tom, tell me right now...

25:57.990 --> 25:59.790
Who's their next target?

26:01.993 --> 26:04.128
It's ziva david.

26:06.031 --> 26:08.999
Eli knew too much;
they think she does, too.

26:20.178 --> 26:22.212
Mcgee:
I just sent a secure e-mail

26:22.214 --> 26:23.881
To mossad in case
ziva shows up there.

26:23.883 --> 26:25.683
How do we know the terror cell

26:25.685 --> 26:26.784
Isn't monitoring
everything we send?

26:26.786 --> 26:27.818
We don't.

26:27.820 --> 26:29.153
Assume it's all
been compromised.

26:29.155 --> 26:30.754
Knowing ziva,
she'll still go under.

26:30.756 --> 26:32.056
She has to.

26:33.024 --> 26:33.924
Well, well.

26:33.926 --> 26:34.858
How was the desert?

26:34.860 --> 26:37.027
They say it's a dry heat.

26:37.029 --> 26:37.928
Welcome back, boss.

26:37.930 --> 26:38.929
What do we got?

26:38.931 --> 26:41.599
World went to hell
while you were gone.

26:41.601 --> 26:43.367
I've got sniper slugs
in my living room,

26:43.369 --> 26:45.936
And the duck man found
a rat in his lab,

26:45.938 --> 26:47.638
And, uh, there's a terrorist
named parsa who...

26:47.640 --> 26:49.373
Yeah, I know all that, dinozzo.
Of course you do.

26:49.375 --> 26:51.241
What don't you know?
Where's ziva?

26:51.243 --> 26:55.212
Mcgee: I'm trying to establish
a protected e-mail account

26:55.214 --> 26:56.647
So we can communicate

26:56.649 --> 26:58.148
Securely overseas.

27:00.251 --> 27:01.251
Yeah.

27:01.253 --> 27:02.786
He's okay.

27:02.788 --> 27:04.321
Working with us now.

27:05.824 --> 27:08.192
It's nice to see that
you guys are alive and well.

27:08.194 --> 27:09.960
Look, I'm sorry
about the, uh...

27:09.962 --> 27:11.629
Both:
I want my badge back.

27:11.631 --> 27:13.831
Yeah, I can understand that.

27:13.833 --> 27:15.399
Not a problem.

27:15.401 --> 27:18.302
Now that the case is,
uh, dismissed,

27:18.304 --> 27:19.870
I'll talk with
director vance

27:19.872 --> 27:20.971
About it.

27:20.973 --> 27:22.039
Thank you, dick.

27:23.808 --> 27:25.909
So, what'd you find out about
the iranian head games?

27:25.911 --> 27:27.411
Lieutenant wasn't killed
in iran.

27:27.413 --> 27:30.648
Uh, yeah.
We, uh, we found out

27:30.650 --> 27:32.983
That lieutenant mcbride
was given orders

27:32.985 --> 27:34.051
Redirecting him
to the United States,

27:34.053 --> 27:38.922
His head was mailed to his house
via a middle eastern detour.

27:38.924 --> 27:40.658
And toss in
a little radioactivity...

27:40.660 --> 27:42.893
I'm so glad that you're here.

27:42.895 --> 27:46.397
To make it look like iran was
responsible for this.

27:46.399 --> 27:48.165
So who actually killed him?

27:48.167 --> 27:49.767
Same people who want us dead.

27:49.769 --> 27:51.702
Local cell. Guns for hire.

27:51.704 --> 27:53.937
Find them. Go.

27:58.910 --> 28:00.244
Abby:
<i>I don't care if you're dirty</i>

28:00.246 --> 28:02.980
Or sweaty or tired
or you smell like the inside of

28:02.982 --> 28:04.982
A cargo plane.
Abbs, yeah, but I do.
Come on.

28:04.984 --> 28:06.450
Results of
lieutenant mcbride's head.

28:06.452 --> 28:09.086
Gibbs, look out!

28:10.922 --> 28:12.089
Parsons: It was getting
a little uncomfortable

28:12.091 --> 28:13.390
In the squad room.

28:13.392 --> 28:16.260
But I can see it's not
much better down here.

28:16.262 --> 28:18.028
Nerve of that creep.

28:18.030 --> 28:20.097
He just thinks he can...
He can go anywhere and...

28:20.099 --> 28:21.865
Abby.
Yes?

28:21.867 --> 28:22.966
Test results.

28:22.968 --> 28:24.234
They're in the other room.

28:24.236 --> 28:25.769
Yeah. And?

28:25.771 --> 28:28.038
And he is in
the other room.

28:28.040 --> 28:29.473
And unless
something has changed,

28:29.475 --> 28:32.409
I am not going in there
with him.

28:32.411 --> 28:36.447
I mean, something would have
to have drastically changed.

28:36.449 --> 28:38.082
Like if he saved my life?

28:38.084 --> 28:40.718
Yeah. Like that's gonna happen.

28:40.720 --> 28:41.719
(both chuckle)

28:41.721 --> 28:43.320
Yeah.

28:43.322 --> 28:46.056
I mean, if he did,
then of course I'm glad,

28:46.058 --> 28:49.927
But, I mean, he hasn't
redeemed himself,

28:49.929 --> 28:51.361
Has he?

28:51.363 --> 28:52.362
Fine.

28:52.364 --> 28:54.998
But I still
don't like him.

28:57.035 --> 28:58.368
Thank you, gibbs. Abby...

28:58.370 --> 29:00.137
No talking, you.

29:01.206 --> 29:02.873
So, I ran the sand grains

29:02.875 --> 29:04.742
From mcbride's hair
and nose and ears,

29:04.744 --> 29:06.310
And they're not all from

29:06.312 --> 29:07.978
Afghanistan or iran.

29:07.980 --> 29:09.179
No, they're from the u.S.

29:09.181 --> 29:10.881
No.

29:10.883 --> 29:12.116
Both.

29:12.118 --> 29:14.118
Some grains were
middle eastern

29:14.120 --> 29:17.221
And the others were from
the sonoran desert.

29:17.223 --> 29:18.522
It's a big place.

29:18.524 --> 29:20.524
Mm-hmm. It extends
from california

29:20.526 --> 29:23.026
To arizona and
into mexico.

29:23.028 --> 29:24.428
But based on
the toxicology results,

29:24.430 --> 29:27.097
The water in his system
and the minerals in his blood

29:27.099 --> 29:28.932
And the pollutants that
were in his windpipe...

29:28.934 --> 29:30.934
Uh, trace amounts like that

29:30.936 --> 29:32.369
Would be so small,
you couldn't possibly

29:32.371 --> 29:33.537
Determine exactly where...

29:33.539 --> 29:38.408
Mcbride was murdered and
beheaded in the copper state.

29:39.244 --> 29:40.310
Arizona.

29:40.312 --> 29:42.846
Thanks, abbs.

29:51.122 --> 29:54.925
If ziva's in trouble, a
badge might come in handy.

29:54.927 --> 29:57.127
If you know how
to get it to her, I'm game.

29:57.129 --> 29:58.996
Well, even if someone
could contact her,

29:58.998 --> 30:00.964
Who would she trust?
Shmeil?

30:00.966 --> 30:05.135
Well, the man of shmeil's
showing his age, mcgee.

30:05.137 --> 30:06.870
She won't risk exposing him.

30:06.872 --> 30:10.040
You have another option,
agent dinozzo?

30:12.243 --> 30:14.812
Let me get this right, dinozzo.

30:14.814 --> 30:17.114
You want me to track down
a former mossad operative

30:17.116 --> 30:19.416
Who has been trained
to disappear?

30:19.418 --> 30:22.219
She's also a former
u.S. Federal agent

30:22.221 --> 30:24.254
Who's recently been under
intense scrutiny.

30:24.256 --> 30:26.123
And you want me
to find her

30:26.125 --> 30:28.826
Without letting anyone else know
that I'm looking?

30:28.828 --> 30:33.063
Because if you lead the wrong
people in her direction,

30:33.065 --> 30:34.264
You might get her killed.

30:34.266 --> 30:36.433
That part you made quite clear.

30:36.435 --> 30:38.168
Do we have a problem, adam?

30:38.170 --> 30:39.169
No.

30:39.171 --> 30:40.571
I'm merely surprised

30:40.573 --> 30:43.874
That you would trust me
with such responsibility.

30:43.876 --> 30:45.943
I thought you did not like me.

30:45.945 --> 30:49.179
I don't.

30:49.181 --> 30:53.050
But ziva trusts you,
so I'm gonna have to.

30:53.052 --> 30:55.252
I'll do what I can.

30:57.388 --> 30:59.156
Hard to know
who to trust anymore.

30:59.158 --> 31:01.391
Has it ever been
easy, tobias?

31:01.393 --> 31:06.296
But with big business
profiting from acts of terror?

31:06.298 --> 31:08.232
It's like chicago,
capone in the '20s.

31:08.234 --> 31:09.233
Yeah.

31:09.235 --> 31:12.069
Well, they caught capone.

31:12.071 --> 31:14.137
That make you feel
any better?

31:14.139 --> 31:16.139
No, it doesn't.

31:16.141 --> 31:21.345
Our headless lieutenant
was ordered to iran

31:21.347 --> 31:23.380
Only to have his
orders cancelled

31:23.382 --> 31:25.148
Without any
record of it.

31:25.150 --> 31:26.416
Who better to do
that than his...

31:26.418 --> 31:27.584
Both:
...Commanding officer.

31:29.254 --> 31:32.155
Mcgee, captain dominick wayne,
jsoc,

31:32.157 --> 31:33.991
Financial records.
On it.

31:33.993 --> 31:35.292
(computer beeping)

31:38.029 --> 31:40.063
All right, I've got captain
wayne's bank statements up.

31:40.065 --> 31:41.198
What exactly am I looking for?

31:41.200 --> 31:43.400
Temptation.
Payoffs.

31:43.402 --> 31:45.035
For throwing mcbride
under the bus,

31:45.037 --> 31:46.336
Sending gibbs
into a desert trap.

31:46.338 --> 31:49.640
No unusual activity or deposits.

31:49.642 --> 31:52.175
It appears our captain's
a typical government employee.

31:52.177 --> 31:53.277
Broke.

31:53.279 --> 31:55.245
Well, maybe he didn't
change the orders.

31:55.247 --> 31:56.113
We could be wrong.

31:56.115 --> 31:57.514
Want to find out?
Yeah.

31:57.516 --> 32:00.350
Mcgee, how's
your handwriting?

32:03.054 --> 32:05.589
Honey, you got something
to light these with?

32:05.591 --> 32:06.990
Mm-hmm.

32:11.596 --> 32:13.096
Who's that?
One second.

32:13.098 --> 32:14.998
Why don't you
take care of it, honey.

32:15.000 --> 32:17.034
I'll be right back.
Okay.

32:17.036 --> 32:19.136
Gentlemen.

32:19.138 --> 32:22.139
Must be important for you
to come all the way out here.

32:22.141 --> 32:24.141
We're having cake
in just a minute.

32:24.143 --> 32:25.709
Might make it worth your while.

32:25.711 --> 32:27.611
Start with the truth, captain.

32:27.613 --> 32:30.580
Tell us about
lieutenant chad mcbride's

32:30.582 --> 32:32.215
Orders in iran.

32:32.217 --> 32:33.116
Fornell:
More specifically,

32:33.118 --> 32:34.284
His orders to come home.

32:34.286 --> 32:38.088
What are you talking about?
He came home in a box.

32:38.090 --> 32:40.123
It was your job to find out
who put him there.

32:40.125 --> 32:42.526
You did.
Fornell:
You know,

32:42.528 --> 32:44.695
It's against regulations
for military personnel

32:44.697 --> 32:47.264
To tell their loved ones
their orders have changed.

32:47.266 --> 32:49.700
But I used to write
my wife anyway.

32:49.702 --> 32:52.269
So did, uh,
chad mcbride.

32:52.271 --> 32:53.637
Just came in the mail today.

32:56.474 --> 33:00.010
"thought you should know,
I talked to captain wayne.

33:00.012 --> 33:02.446
"he changed my orders.

33:02.448 --> 33:05.215
You can stop worrying."

33:05.217 --> 33:07.718
Little did he know,
you set him up to be executed.

33:10.154 --> 33:12.222
I didn't know they
were gonna kill him.

33:14.158 --> 33:15.993
I wouldn't have
made that call.

33:15.995 --> 33:17.461
Who paid you?

33:17.463 --> 33:19.529
Where's the money?

33:19.531 --> 33:21.398
They didn't offer me money.

33:21.400 --> 33:23.633
They offered pictures.

33:23.635 --> 33:26.303
Of my infidelity.

33:26.305 --> 33:28.338
Blackmail.

33:28.340 --> 33:30.140
Fornell:
Another capone tactic.

33:32.643 --> 33:35.312
I couldn't let them
take all this away.

33:35.314 --> 33:36.680
Them?

33:36.682 --> 33:38.215
I got a call.

33:38.217 --> 33:40.183
To change
mcbride's orders.

33:40.185 --> 33:43.587
Another to send
agent gibbs to iran.

33:43.589 --> 33:46.223
But I don't know
who it was.

33:46.225 --> 33:49.059
I-I'll give you
my phone records, anything.

33:51.195 --> 33:53.096
Including my resignation.

33:53.098 --> 33:55.632
And don't forget
your prison time.

33:55.634 --> 33:58.035
And your court-martial, captain.

33:58.803 --> 34:00.737
I'm sorry.

34:00.739 --> 34:03.707
Tell it to mcbride's wife.

34:18.322 --> 34:21.591
Special agent gibbs,
I want you to meet tomas mendez.

34:21.593 --> 34:24.361
He's on the board of the public
anti-terrorism coalition.

34:24.363 --> 34:26.763
Mendez: The coalition helps
facilitate cooperation

34:26.765 --> 34:29.132
Between private businesses
and government agencies

34:29.134 --> 34:30.400
In the fight
against terror.

34:30.402 --> 34:31.735
What brings you
here, mr. Mendez?

34:31.737 --> 34:34.304
Tomas was working closely
with homeland.

34:34.306 --> 34:37.207
They were monitoring parsa
and the new terror cell.

34:37.209 --> 34:38.708
Mendez: Parsa's
hard to pin down.

34:38.710 --> 34:40.844
This was taken by a
surveillance camera

34:40.846 --> 34:42.712
In one of my apartment
buildings in miami.

34:42.714 --> 34:45.816
As part of the
coalition initiatives,

34:45.818 --> 34:48.485
All of my building
security cameras are linked

34:48.487 --> 34:50.454
With government lists.

34:50.456 --> 34:51.855
And his face flagged.

34:51.857 --> 34:53.423
We had been working
with homeland,

34:53.425 --> 34:54.825
But since morrow was injured,

34:54.827 --> 34:56.359
We thought we'd reach out
to you.
Mm-hmm.

34:56.361 --> 34:58.395
It's best we're all
on the same page.

34:58.397 --> 35:01.731
You own any property
in arizona, mr. Mendez?

35:01.733 --> 35:03.200
Beautiful state.

35:03.202 --> 35:04.601
Why?

35:04.603 --> 35:07.104
We think whoever's
calling the shots

35:07.106 --> 35:08.705
Has a cell working there.

35:08.707 --> 35:11.408
We could use
your help.

35:15.646 --> 35:17.714
(elevator bell dings)

35:19.884 --> 35:21.418
Are you getting out or what?

35:21.420 --> 35:23.787
Well, actually,
I was coming to find you.

35:23.789 --> 35:25.755
If you're going down,
I can tag along.

35:25.757 --> 35:26.790
If that's okay?

35:26.792 --> 35:28.325
(chuckles)

35:32.563 --> 35:33.830
(elevator bell dings)

35:36.801 --> 35:38.869
(elevator whirring)

35:42.373 --> 35:44.541
(sighs)

35:44.543 --> 35:48.478
Okay, look, you may not
like me or what I do.

35:48.480 --> 35:49.846
Whatever gave you
that impression?

35:49.848 --> 35:52.315
But when I investigate
someone, I do it very well.

35:52.317 --> 35:54.818
Well, then you and I
have something in common.

35:54.820 --> 35:55.919
What's this?

35:55.921 --> 35:57.587
It's a peace offering.

35:57.589 --> 35:58.688
Of sorts.

36:00.658 --> 36:02.325
Eli david owns

36:02.327 --> 36:03.927
A farmhouse outside of yavne'el.

36:03.929 --> 36:05.595
It's his safe house.

36:05.597 --> 36:06.830
It's under a
false name,

36:06.832 --> 36:08.365
And I don't think
anyone knows about it.

36:08.367 --> 36:10.167
Except maybe ziva.

36:10.169 --> 36:11.168
(chuckles)

36:11.170 --> 36:12.602
And a slimy beltway lawyer.

36:12.604 --> 36:14.638
That makes total sense to me.

36:14.640 --> 36:16.740
You're grasping
at straws.

36:16.742 --> 36:18.875
You're looking for her.

36:18.877 --> 36:22.445
Then you know
I have to vet this file.

36:22.447 --> 36:24.181
I would hope so.

36:24.183 --> 36:26.950
Or I'll start to think
you actually trust me.

36:26.952 --> 36:28.451
(elevator whirring)

36:28.453 --> 36:30.320
(sighs)

36:30.322 --> 36:32.389
(elevator bell dings)

36:34.792 --> 36:36.860
Fornell: <i>You know, I'm not gonna</i>
<i>kiss you good night.</i>

36:36.862 --> 36:38.428
What?

36:38.430 --> 36:40.630
Why are you
walking me to my car?

36:40.632 --> 36:42.532
We breaking up?

36:42.534 --> 36:44.834
If I could, I would.
Unfortunately, I trust you.

36:44.836 --> 36:46.903
Well, feeling's mutual,
so there you go.

36:46.905 --> 36:48.371
Somebody's got
to slay the dragons.

36:48.373 --> 36:49.806
Might as well be us.
Mm-hmm.

36:54.679 --> 36:56.680
Look, if this is gonna turn
into a proposal,

36:56.682 --> 36:57.847
I'm just not ready.

36:57.849 --> 37:00.717
How long did you know
ncis was in danger

37:04.322 --> 37:07.490
As soon as I found out some
jackass was hiring turncoats,

37:07.492 --> 37:08.925
I came to you.

37:08.927 --> 37:12.596
And I can only hope that
you'd do the same if it was me.

37:12.598 --> 37:15.865
No matter how this
unfolds, tobias,

37:15.867 --> 37:18.235
I got your back.

37:25.610 --> 37:26.943
Ducky:
<i>During the blitz,</i>

37:26.945 --> 37:29.346
Children were given
little white flags

37:29.348 --> 37:30.480
To mark the positions

37:30.482 --> 37:33.450
Of any unexploded
incendiary bombs.

37:33.452 --> 37:35.785
Seems like just building
a victory garden

37:35.787 --> 37:37.887
Would have been
far less dangerous.

37:37.889 --> 37:39.723
Ducky:
But not nearly so rewarding.

37:39.725 --> 37:42.926
End of the war, I had a terrific
shrapnel collection.

37:42.928 --> 37:45.362
It was better than cash
in the school playground.

37:45.364 --> 37:47.297
I could even identify

37:47.299 --> 37:48.999
Many of the pieces.

37:49.001 --> 37:50.267
I'm hoping you still can, duck.

37:50.269 --> 37:53.270
Well, you're in luck, jethro.

37:53.272 --> 37:56.273
With the aid of abby's
chemical analysis

37:56.275 --> 37:57.741
And timothy's database,

37:57.743 --> 37:59.476
We have done just that.

37:59.478 --> 38:01.911
Times have changed
since you were five.

38:01.913 --> 38:03.313
Not as much as you might think.

38:03.315 --> 38:04.881
By using the same methods

38:04.883 --> 38:06.650
That ducky used
when he was a child,

38:06.652 --> 38:09.753
I.D.'ing metal types
and manufacturing marks,

38:09.755 --> 38:11.921
We can link the shrapnel

38:11.923 --> 38:14.424
Removed from secnav jarvis

38:14.426 --> 38:17.060
And others to devices that
were used in the past.

38:17.062 --> 38:18.995
A trigger used twice in yemen.

38:18.997 --> 38:20.930
Plastic explosive used
by a white supremacy group

38:20.932 --> 38:22.799
In south dakota.

38:22.801 --> 38:24.301
Times have changed.

38:24.303 --> 38:25.735
People, not so much.

38:25.737 --> 38:28.471
But the majority of links
were on the casing itself.

38:29.940 --> 38:30.940
Bike?

38:30.942 --> 38:32.309
Yup.

38:32.311 --> 38:33.910
Somebody filled
all of the empty tubing

38:33.912 --> 38:37.047
On a mountain bike with
the contents from a pipe bomb.

38:37.049 --> 38:38.481
Hell of a signature.

38:38.483 --> 38:40.884
Mcgee: And it's the signature
we have on file.

38:40.886 --> 38:42.018
Belongs to
a soldier-of-fortune group

38:42.020 --> 38:43.620
The fbi has been tracking

38:43.622 --> 38:46.022
Called the brotherhood of doubt.

38:46.024 --> 38:48.458
No doubt made up of people
who have little faith

38:48.460 --> 38:52.062
In the country that protects
their inalienable rights.

38:52.064 --> 38:53.063
Where?

38:53.065 --> 38:54.097
Yuma.

38:54.099 --> 38:55.765
Arizona.

38:55.767 --> 38:57.067
That's good work, guys.

38:57.069 --> 38:59.035
Hey, tobias.

38:59.037 --> 39:00.837
Come on back.
You're not going home yet.

39:19.023 --> 39:21.091
Clear!

39:25.129 --> 39:27.364
Lieutenant mcbride.

39:45.683 --> 39:47.117
Got c-4 and detonators.

39:58.095 --> 40:01.164
Photos of their targets.

40:09.173 --> 40:10.673
Mr. Mendez?

40:10.675 --> 40:12.142
Agent gibbs.

40:12.144 --> 40:14.477
I have a feeling this is
not a coincidence?

40:14.479 --> 40:16.179
You need to come with me.

40:16.181 --> 40:18.014
