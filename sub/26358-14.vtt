WEBVTT

00:07.703 --> 00:08.660
Closer!

00:08.704 --> 00:10.271
Seriously?
If I get any closer,

00:10.314 --> 00:11.315
you're gonna be roadkill.

00:13.404 --> 00:15.798
Just for the record,
this is a terrible plan.

00:15.841 --> 00:17.017
Closer!

00:24.372 --> 00:26.200
Deeks, what the hell was that?

00:26.243 --> 00:28.028
That?
No-no, don't worry about that.

00:28.071 --> 00:29.072
How you doing, buddy?

00:29.116 --> 00:30.508
I cut the remote detonator

00:30.552 --> 00:32.206
so they couldn't trigger
the bomb with a cell phone.

00:32.249 --> 00:33.337
Well, that's great!

00:33.381 --> 00:35.252
But now we got
a countdown.

00:35.296 --> 00:36.688
There's 60 seconds left.

00:36.732 --> 00:38.081
Yeah, well, that is not great,

00:38.125 --> 00:39.735
'cause we are close
to that target.

00:39.778 --> 00:40.649
How's my girl?

00:40.692 --> 00:42.303
Just working out some issues.

00:42.346 --> 00:43.956
What about G?

00:44.000 --> 00:47.438
Oh, he's good, but he's about
to do something really stupid.

01:07.806 --> 01:09.330
Oh!

01:10.418 --> 01:13.203
Little heads-up
on that one, maybe?

01:15.031 --> 01:18.426
G, we're running out of options.
We've got 15 seconds left.

01:23.387 --> 01:25.215
SAM:
Seven seconds.

01:28.131 --> 01:29.437
Brace yourself!

01:38.489 --> 01:40.317
Guys, get out of there!

01:40.361 --> 01:41.536
Let's go!

01:45.017 --> 01:46.584
The bomb's defused.

01:54.984 --> 01:57.334
Wow.

01:57.378 --> 01:58.640
You okay?

01:58.683 --> 02:00.685
Yeah.

02:07.692 --> 02:09.477
That was too close.

02:09.520 --> 02:11.566
You think?

02:38.245 --> 02:39.289
Massive head trauma.
Internal bleeding.

02:39.333 --> 02:40.508
Tell them to prep the OR.

02:40.551 --> 02:41.509
DISPATCH:
Copy that. We'll set it up.

02:41.552 --> 02:43.119
God, what'd
you do to him?

02:43.163 --> 02:44.903
Well, inertia's a bitch.
Actually, he had me

02:44.947 --> 02:46.427
on the ropes there
towards the end.

02:46.470 --> 02:47.645
That's 'cause you haven't
slept in 48 hours.

02:47.689 --> 02:49.212
None of us have.

02:49.256 --> 02:51.127
I'm lucky I didn't drive the
Hellcat into that harbor.

02:51.171 --> 02:53.260
Oh, yeah? Well, if you had,
my advice would've been

02:53.303 --> 02:54.261
you stay in the vehicle.

02:54.304 --> 02:55.479
Maybe we get
one of our own.

02:55.523 --> 02:56.785
Yeah?You know, trade in the Audi

02:56.828 --> 02:58.047
for a red one with some
flames on the side?

02:58.090 --> 02:59.788
How about no?Agent Ross.

02:59.831 --> 03:02.486
Agent Hanna. Agent
Callen filled me in

03:02.530 --> 03:04.140
on what you guys
did here today.

03:04.184 --> 03:05.533
You saved a
lot of lives.

03:05.576 --> 03:07.274
No, we couldn't have done
it without your team.

03:07.317 --> 03:10.451
The Mashriq Army has only ever
attacked live military targets.

03:10.494 --> 03:12.235
I mean, we never even
considered the possibility

03:12.279 --> 03:14.281
they might go after
a museum vessel.

03:14.324 --> 03:17.109
It was symbolic.
It wasn't strategic.

03:17.153 --> 03:18.459
Sometimes that's
just as effective.

03:20.504 --> 03:23.159
It's the director.
I need to take this.

03:23.203 --> 03:25.161
I'll make sure Washington
knows what you did today.

03:25.205 --> 03:28.251
Thank you.
Thanks.

03:28.295 --> 03:30.601
Maybe this'll get us
out of the doghouse.

03:30.645 --> 03:31.907
Maybe.

03:31.950 --> 03:33.517
Hmm.
We should get out of here.

03:33.561 --> 03:35.084
Ochoa wants a full report.

03:35.127 --> 03:36.999
I'll drive.Like hell you will.
Give me the keys.

03:37.042 --> 03:38.696
What? No. Hold up.Deeks? Give me my keys.

03:38.740 --> 03:40.263
DEEKS:
Oh, come on, dude, did you
see me driving that thing?

03:40.307 --> 03:41.743
'Cause I was on fire.

03:45.529 --> 03:48.097
I got you.Thank you.

03:48.140 --> 03:49.098
Sorry.

03:49.141 --> 03:50.621
We packed an arsenal.

03:50.665 --> 03:52.623
Did you even
fire a shot?

03:52.667 --> 03:55.278
I was on that bomb; I didn't
have time to take a shot.

03:55.322 --> 03:57.976
Well, I mean,
you had one second.

03:58.020 --> 04:00.762
If we're being honest.

04:00.805 --> 04:02.242
If we're being honest.

04:02.285 --> 04:04.287
Do you have a problem
with how I defused the bomb?

04:04.331 --> 04:06.202
I don't have a problem. I just--

04:06.246 --> 04:07.856
I don't know, it's a little
suspicious, that's all.

04:07.899 --> 04:09.814
What are you talking about?

04:09.858 --> 04:11.425
Come on. One second?
Really? Two seconds, fine.

04:11.468 --> 04:13.296
Um, I get that.
Three seconds, no problem.

04:13.340 --> 04:15.080
But-- One second?
That's just you

04:15.124 --> 04:17.082
trying to cut it close
for dramatic effect.

04:17.126 --> 04:19.607
I'm glad you think I'd be
so cavalier with our lives.

04:19.650 --> 04:21.652
Callen's right.
You've defused a lot of bombs.

04:21.696 --> 04:23.611
I think you're getting bored.Thank you.

04:23.654 --> 04:26.309
Sam, your relationship with
bombs is like any relationship.

04:26.353 --> 04:28.093
You got to keep it interesting
or the spark goes out.

04:28.137 --> 04:29.921
Are you guys finished saying
thank you

04:29.965 --> 04:31.619
for me saving your lives?

04:31.662 --> 04:32.620
Yep.

04:32.663 --> 04:34.404
Yep.Yep.

04:34.448 --> 04:36.101
You're welcome.

04:36.145 --> 04:37.929
Hey, guys. I'm so glad
you're all okay.

04:37.973 --> 04:40.410
Yeah, me, too.
We got a hit.

04:40.454 --> 04:41.803
But-- N-- What?
What do you mean, a hit?

04:41.846 --> 04:43.239
The case is closed.

04:43.283 --> 04:44.675
Oh-- You didn't-- I-I
thought you were gonna...

04:44.719 --> 04:45.850
Oh, I thought that you were
going to...

04:45.894 --> 04:47.678
Guys.
What's going on?

04:47.722 --> 04:49.637
While you were stopping
the bomb, we got a hit

04:49.680 --> 04:52.117
on one of the terrorists
working for the Mashriq Army.

04:52.161 --> 04:53.684
Wasim Ghulam.

04:53.728 --> 04:55.512
KENSI:
No, no, no, no, this
guy's not a problem.

04:55.556 --> 04:57.079
I just put him
in the hospital.

04:57.122 --> 04:59.560
That's true, but this
other guy might be.

04:59.603 --> 05:01.692
Ghulam has met with him
on multiple occasions,

05:01.736 --> 05:04.347
always in a different place.SAM: Huh.

05:04.391 --> 05:07.350
It looks like he's passing
something off to Ghulam.Mm-hmm.

05:07.394 --> 05:08.656
Who is he?

05:08.699 --> 05:11.354
ERIC: Abbas Jalal.
He's a student from Iraq.

05:11.398 --> 05:13.965
He's currently enrolled in
Boyle Heights Community College

05:14.009 --> 05:16.751
and scheduled to be
in class right now.

05:16.794 --> 05:18.579
NELL: I'm so sorry, guys.
You must be exhausted.

05:18.622 --> 05:20.276
No, no, it's okay.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.582
That's what we do.

05:21.625 --> 05:22.670
OCHOA:
Not tonight.

05:22.713 --> 05:25.542
I just spoke
with David Ross, FBI.

05:25.586 --> 05:26.848
They're on Jalal.

05:26.891 --> 05:28.415
They expect to make an arrest
any moment now.

05:28.458 --> 05:29.590
Okay, and we'll
provide the backup.

05:29.633 --> 05:30.895
It's not a
problem at all.

05:30.939 --> 05:32.941
You've all been working
two days straight now.

05:32.984 --> 05:34.290
You need the rest.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.988
Hell, you've earned it.

05:37.032 --> 05:39.774
Take tomorrow off.
That's an order.

05:41.863 --> 05:45.562
Well, you heard what he said.
Go home.

05:45.606 --> 05:47.608
Sam and I will
finish up here.

05:47.651 --> 05:49.479
No way.
I'm not even tired.

05:49.523 --> 05:50.567
That's your
adrenaline rush.

05:50.611 --> 05:52.003
When it ends,
you'll crash.

05:52.047 --> 05:53.222
Go ahead. We got this.

05:53.265 --> 05:54.919
All right. Fair enough.

05:54.963 --> 05:56.747
Thank you, gentlemen.Thank you.

05:56.791 --> 05:59.054
So, uh, adrenaline.
We should probably find

05:59.097 --> 06:01.622
some creative way
to utilize that.

06:01.665 --> 06:03.754
What do you have
in mind, Detective?

06:03.798 --> 06:05.626
AGENT:
Hey, boss.

06:05.669 --> 06:07.236
Yeah, we got Jalal.

06:07.279 --> 06:09.717
Picked him up outside
the community college.

06:09.760 --> 06:12.676
Didn't run, didn't fight.
Hasn't said a word.

06:12.720 --> 06:14.417
Yeah, that's what we figure.

06:14.461 --> 06:16.332
He's got no one else
to turn to.

06:16.376 --> 06:19.944
We're on our way
to the safe house now.

06:19.988 --> 06:21.555
Thank you, sir.

06:23.731 --> 06:28.344
He said
I did good work.

06:28.388 --> 06:29.606
And what about me?

06:29.650 --> 06:31.739
Hmm, funny,
he didn't mention you.

06:31.782 --> 06:33.393
We both did
the same work.

06:33.436 --> 06:35.438
Hey, next time
we catch a terrorist,

06:35.482 --> 06:37.832
you can call Ross,
and I'll drive.

06:37.875 --> 06:40.008
Oh, hell, no, you
are a terrible...Watch out!

06:45.535 --> 06:47.798
Hey, you move,
I shoot you.

06:47.842 --> 06:50.497
Hey, are you okay?

06:50.540 --> 06:51.976
Nelson!

07:36.543 --> 07:39.197
You know, in some cultures,
it's considered creepy

07:39.241 --> 07:41.330
to watch someone
while they're sleeping.

07:41.373 --> 07:44.507
It's a good thing
you're not sleeping, then.

07:44.551 --> 07:46.509
Yeah, but you
didn't know that.

07:46.553 --> 07:47.510
Mmm...

07:47.554 --> 07:49.512
Kinda did.

07:49.556 --> 07:52.384
You do this cute whistling
thing in your sleep.

07:52.428 --> 07:54.038
No, I don't.

07:54.082 --> 07:56.258
Mmm.

07:56.301 --> 07:58.652
Wait, I whistle in my sleep?Yes, you do.

07:58.695 --> 08:01.350
From your nose.

08:01.393 --> 08:02.873
Sounds a little
something like this.

08:09.576 --> 08:11.752
My God, that sounds
like a dying swan.

08:11.795 --> 08:13.318
No, don't do that, it's--

08:13.362 --> 08:16.191
I'm horrified that
you have to listen to that.

08:16.234 --> 08:17.714
I'll go sleep
in the garage, it's fine.

08:17.758 --> 08:19.673
I'll sleep on the porch.No, I love it.

08:19.716 --> 08:21.239
I couldn't sleep
without it.

08:21.283 --> 08:23.503
Well, that is simultaneously
the sweetest and weirdest thing

08:23.546 --> 08:26.114
anyone's ever said to me
my whole entire life.

08:29.509 --> 08:30.814
What's going on?

08:32.860 --> 08:37.778
Well...
I've been thinking.

08:42.304 --> 08:44.741
We really can't keep doing
this forever, can we?

08:47.178 --> 08:49.746
No, we cannot.

08:49.790 --> 08:52.357
I mean, one more second and we
would've been gone, you know?

08:52.401 --> 08:55.578
How many times can we
cut it that close?

08:55.622 --> 08:57.406
Well, I haven't exactly
hidden my feelings

08:57.449 --> 08:59.495
on the subject, but I
also want to be respectful.

08:59.539 --> 09:01.932
So, when you're ready
to stop, so am I.

09:05.588 --> 09:08.417
I know. And I
appreciate that.

09:14.423 --> 09:16.338
Yeah, but then I, um...

09:18.253 --> 09:23.171
...I just think of people
like David Sarraf, and...

09:23.214 --> 09:25.565
how he just needed
someone in that moment.

09:25.608 --> 09:27.131
He needed you.

09:27.175 --> 09:28.393
He needed his wife.

09:28.437 --> 09:30.308
Yeah, but his wife
wasn't there, baby,

09:30.352 --> 09:31.962
so he needed you.

09:42.669 --> 09:45.976
I just want to keep
helping people, Deeks.

09:48.718 --> 09:51.416
And I love what I do.
I love it so much.

09:51.460 --> 09:56.160
And I love it even more that
I get to do it with you.

10:02.689 --> 10:05.866
I'd be lying
if I didn't say me, too.

10:14.483 --> 10:17.486
But we also don't have to make
these decisions right now.

10:20.184 --> 10:24.188
I mean, the truth is we don't
have to do anything, right now.

10:26.190 --> 10:29.150
Let's just stay
in bed all day.

10:31.848 --> 10:34.198
That sounds wonderful.

10:39.073 --> 10:40.552
I love you.

10:40.596 --> 10:42.076
I love you.

10:46.733 --> 10:48.691
Yeah. You get the tackle, Tom?

10:48.735 --> 10:50.650
Yeah, we'll be there soon.

10:50.693 --> 10:53.000
I'm just at G's place
to pick him up.

11:07.057 --> 11:09.669
You know Deeks
just put that door in.

11:12.280 --> 11:15.370
What are you doing down here?

11:18.460 --> 11:21.463
I don't have a coffee maker yet.

11:21.506 --> 11:23.247
So I come down here.

11:25.119 --> 11:27.599
You get any sleep last night?

11:27.643 --> 11:28.862
I'll sleep on the boat.

11:28.905 --> 11:32.604
Fishing is supposed
to be relaxing, right?

11:34.824 --> 11:37.261
We'll find your father.

11:37.305 --> 11:39.263
You know,
I don't need a pep talk.

11:39.307 --> 11:40.830
I'm all good with those.

11:40.874 --> 11:43.659
And oddly enough,
that call was about Hetty.

11:43.703 --> 11:45.356
Previous ten were about my dad.

11:45.400 --> 11:47.532
All dead ends, by the way.

11:47.576 --> 11:49.665
The next one doesn't have to be.

11:49.709 --> 11:53.625
You know, sh-she doesn't even
want to be found.

11:53.669 --> 11:54.931
So why do we keep looking?

11:54.975 --> 11:57.151
A-And as far as
my dad goes,

11:57.194 --> 11:59.283
I'm probably not gonna
like what I find anyway.

11:59.327 --> 12:01.416
Doesn't mean we stop trying.

12:01.459 --> 12:04.201
Hmph.

12:08.162 --> 12:09.424
Deputy Director, good morning.

12:11.078 --> 12:13.645
Of course.
We'll be right in.

12:13.689 --> 12:15.778
Yes, sir. He's here with me.

12:15.822 --> 12:17.649
He's having problems
with his phone.

12:18.825 --> 12:20.957
We'll be there soon.

12:21.001 --> 12:23.960
All right.

12:24.004 --> 12:27.137
The fish are gonna
have to wait.

12:27.181 --> 12:28.617
Sounds like it.

12:32.490 --> 12:34.014
When did this happen?

12:34.057 --> 12:35.406
Last night.

12:35.450 --> 12:37.800
FBI Agents Nelson and Yim
picked up Abbas Jalal

12:37.844 --> 12:39.497
outside of City College.

12:39.541 --> 12:41.673
Couple of hours later,
their bodies were found

12:41.717 --> 12:43.240
under an overpass
in East L.A.

12:43.284 --> 12:45.590
Their car and Jalal were gone.

12:45.634 --> 12:47.984
Naturally, SECNAV wants us
back on the task force.

12:48.028 --> 12:49.681
These are traffic cams
from the overpass.

12:49.725 --> 12:52.032
On this first one, you can see
the FBI vehicle heading under.

12:52.075 --> 12:54.686
And here it is exiting
the other side.

12:54.730 --> 12:57.080
SAM: That's only
a 30-second delay.

12:57.124 --> 12:58.603
CALLEN: Stop a car,
take out two agents.

12:58.647 --> 13:00.127
These guys
are well-trained.

13:00.170 --> 13:02.303
Yeah, we're only assuming
multiple killers.

13:02.346 --> 13:04.696
Unfortunately, no cameras
under the overpass.

13:04.740 --> 13:06.786
They chose this place
deliberately.

13:06.829 --> 13:08.788
FBI's been processing the scene
all night.

13:08.831 --> 13:10.702
They still have nothing.What about the SUV?

13:10.746 --> 13:12.313
It's got to have LoJack
or something.

13:12.356 --> 13:14.663
Disabled 200 yards
down the road.

13:14.706 --> 13:16.404
And an hour later,
someone called 911

13:16.447 --> 13:20.277
to report an SUV on fire
in a vacant lot in Frogtown.

13:20.321 --> 13:22.627
FBI has confirmed that
it's their vehicle.

13:22.671 --> 13:25.239
I already sent Kensi and Deeks
to the lot.

13:25.282 --> 13:26.718
Meanwhile, the FBI
is rounding up everyone

13:26.762 --> 13:28.242
with a connection to Jalal.

13:28.285 --> 13:29.809
I offered to help
with the interrogations

13:29.852 --> 13:31.027
and they're sending one our way.

13:31.071 --> 13:32.899
Well, we should also talk
to Wasim Ghulam.

13:32.942 --> 13:35.205
He's the only surviving member
of the attack yesterday.

13:35.249 --> 13:37.555
Unfortunately,
he's back in surgery.

13:37.599 --> 13:39.557
He won't be out
for another four hours.

13:39.601 --> 13:41.864
Well, JTTF should increase
security at the hospital.

13:41.908 --> 13:44.562
If the Mashriq Army went to all
this effort to spring Jalal,

13:44.606 --> 13:46.129
they may go after Ghulam, too.

13:46.173 --> 13:48.218
I'll call Special Agent Ross.

13:48.262 --> 13:50.699
Until Ghulam wakes up,
we need a better handle

13:50.742 --> 13:52.614
on this Mashriq Army.

13:52.657 --> 13:54.834
Clearly, we underestimated
their presence here.

13:56.705 --> 13:58.446
No one saw this coming, Nell.

13:58.489 --> 14:00.100
Not even the FBI.

14:00.143 --> 14:03.668
I've analyzed the intel on the
Mashriq Army for over a week.

14:03.712 --> 14:05.279
All signs indicated
that they had

14:05.322 --> 14:06.889
an extremely
limited network.

14:06.933 --> 14:09.022
I mean, I guess I
missed something.

14:09.065 --> 14:11.154
Hey, you did everything
you could.

14:11.198 --> 14:13.765
Yeah, tell that
to Agents Nelson and Yim.

14:13.809 --> 14:16.333
No sense beating yourself up.

14:16.377 --> 14:18.770
NELL:
I know that.

14:18.814 --> 14:21.034
That's why I think we should
bring in somebody else.

14:21.077 --> 14:23.732
Her name came up while I was
researching the Mashriq Army.

14:23.775 --> 14:25.908
I really think
she could help.

14:25.952 --> 14:27.736
Bring her in.
NELL:
Okay.

14:27.779 --> 14:29.694
Nobody else dies today.

14:33.916 --> 14:35.875
ROSS: All right, guys,
come on, let's wrap this up.

14:35.918 --> 14:36.876
AGENT:
Yes, sir.

14:39.400 --> 14:41.097
DEEKS:
Agent Ross.

14:43.230 --> 14:44.753
So sorry for your loss.

14:44.796 --> 14:47.364
Thank you. They, um...

14:47.408 --> 14:49.279
they were good agents.

14:49.323 --> 14:51.891
And Yim, he was, um...

14:53.936 --> 14:56.156
Ah, he was a new father.

14:56.199 --> 14:58.854
Still have
to inform his wife.

15:00.943 --> 15:02.945
Look, uh...

15:02.989 --> 15:05.556
I think you may have wasted
your time coming out here today.

15:05.600 --> 15:07.515
There's not a single camera
within five blocks.

15:07.558 --> 15:09.865
We've got no tire tracks,
and the fire's gonna take care

15:09.909 --> 15:11.998
of any... any prints or DNA.

15:12.041 --> 15:14.739
We'd still like to take a
look, if that's all right.

15:14.783 --> 15:17.220
Be my guest.

15:17.264 --> 15:20.484
But if you find anything,
you tell me.

15:20.528 --> 15:23.183
I want first crack

a single print,

17:10.638 --> 17:12.292
not even Nelson's
or Yim's.

17:14.120 --> 17:15.208
You know what this is?

17:15.251 --> 17:17.906
Yeah. Sadly,
that's somebody's house.

17:17.949 --> 17:20.604
It's got a direct line of sight
to the SUV.

17:20.648 --> 17:23.129
Probably couldn't even see this
at night.

17:23.172 --> 17:27.089
Which means... if we find
the person that lives there,

17:27.133 --> 17:29.091
maybe we don't need a print.Maybe

17:29.135 --> 17:30.701
we just found ourselves
a witness.

17:30.745 --> 17:34.009
The Mashriq Army is unique
among terrorist groups

17:34.053 --> 17:35.880
that formed after
the invasion of Iraq.

17:35.924 --> 17:38.535
They have no desire
to implement Sharia law

17:38.579 --> 17:40.798
or establish an Islamic state
in the Arabian Peninsula.

17:40.842 --> 17:44.063
They leave that to the other
dozen entities already trying.

17:44.106 --> 17:46.369
They prefer to wage war
on the "far enemy."

17:46.413 --> 17:48.893
Hence the attack on
the USS Iowahere.

17:48.937 --> 17:52.027
They're all about taking the war
off their home turf

17:52.071 --> 17:53.724
and bringing it back to us,

17:53.768 --> 17:55.987
to the people they
believe started it.

17:56.031 --> 17:59.339
Most analysts see this
as a strategic choice,

17:59.382 --> 18:03.343
but after interviewing former
and current members,

18:03.386 --> 18:04.996
I'd say there's
an emotional component

18:05.040 --> 18:06.215
that's gone unexplored.

18:06.259 --> 18:08.043
You're talking about revenge.

18:08.087 --> 18:10.524
They believe the U.S. military
has ravaged their home,

18:10.567 --> 18:15.094
killed their women and children,
destroyed their way of life.

18:16.138 --> 18:18.749
The Mashriq Army is
more than a group.

18:18.793 --> 18:22.318
They're a feeling, and
feelings are contagious

18:22.362 --> 18:24.103
and hard to wipe out.

18:27.367 --> 18:30.021
This cell member, Abbas Jalal--

18:30.065 --> 18:32.285
he wasn't on your radar
yesterday?

18:32.328 --> 18:35.723
We believed that we had
accounted for all the members.

18:35.766 --> 18:38.029
If the Mashriq Army thought
it was worth the risk

18:38.073 --> 18:39.683
to free Jalal,
he must be important, huh?

18:39.727 --> 18:43.687
In my experience, no M.A. member
ever has all the information.

18:43.731 --> 18:45.994
That's just standard
operating procedure.

18:46.037 --> 18:48.953
So, if they took Jalal, it isn't
to keep him from talking.

18:48.997 --> 18:51.173
Mm-hmm.It's because they need him
for something.

18:51.217 --> 18:53.958
Another attack.

18:54.002 --> 18:56.135
And at the rate at which
they've acted,

18:56.178 --> 19:00.008
you can bet whatever they're
planning, it's imminent.

19:13.630 --> 19:14.805
ERIC:
Nell, you did what you could.

19:14.849 --> 19:16.155
I should have
brought her in sooner.

19:16.198 --> 19:17.808
Maybe those agents
would still be alive.

19:17.852 --> 19:20.463
Nell, Agent Namazi is
barely out of FLETC.

19:20.507 --> 19:23.074
Yeah, where she received some of
the highest marks of the year.

19:23.118 --> 19:24.685
Hey, you earned
high marks, too.

19:24.728 --> 19:26.991
Yeah, and before that, she was
a Naval Intelligence specialist,

19:27.035 --> 19:29.037
working high-level
investigations of
terrorist networks.

19:29.080 --> 19:31.126
Hey, you know what, she
grew up in Beverly Hills.

19:31.170 --> 19:32.519
I mean, what is
she gonna be like?

19:32.562 --> 19:33.781
"Oh, my God, a terrorist.

19:33.824 --> 19:36.175
As if. Like, gag me with
a spoon. Barf me out."

19:36.218 --> 19:38.960
Eric, please stop
doing that.

19:39.003 --> 19:41.963
All I'm saying is that she
may be a very helpful resource,

19:42.006 --> 19:44.400
and maybe I should have
called her in here sooner.

19:44.444 --> 19:46.837
Plus, that's a Valley girl,
not someone from Beverly Hills.

19:46.881 --> 19:48.317
And-- oh, good,
here she comes now.

19:48.361 --> 19:51.973
Jones, Beale.
Special Agent Fatima Namazi.

19:52.016 --> 19:54.149
Hi.
Hi, welcome.

19:54.193 --> 19:56.064
Thank you.

19:56.107 --> 19:58.762
It's great to meet you,

19:58.806 --> 20:01.591
It is so great
to meet you, Nell.

20:01.635 --> 20:03.550
Sorry, is it okay
that I call you Nell?

20:03.593 --> 20:05.378
I feel like I know you.

20:05.421 --> 20:07.467
Um, you do?

20:07.510 --> 20:09.208
I've been following your career

20:09.251 --> 20:11.166
since I started
Naval Intelligence.

20:11.210 --> 20:12.994
Your white paper on
the Comescu crime family

20:13.037 --> 20:17.128
was unparalleled in its scope
and so insightful.

20:17.172 --> 20:20.088
And you wrote it while
working here, which is...

20:20.131 --> 20:21.220
insane.

20:22.569 --> 20:24.745
It's just really great
to meet you in person.

20:24.788 --> 20:28.052
Well, that is really
very kind of you.

20:28.096 --> 20:30.490
And, uh, of course you can
call me Nell.

20:30.533 --> 20:32.231
Call me Fatima.

20:32.274 --> 20:34.102
You can call me Eric.

20:34.145 --> 20:36.060
Okay.I've got a video conference

20:36.104 --> 20:37.801
with Homeland.
I'll let you to it.

20:37.845 --> 20:38.846
Okay.

20:40.717 --> 20:43.242
Thank you for bringing me in.

20:43.285 --> 20:46.201
Oh, of course.
After what had happened,

20:46.245 --> 20:49.378
I thought we could use
a fresh set of eyes here.

20:49.422 --> 20:51.424
Honestly, I-I don't know
what more I can provide.

20:51.467 --> 20:53.687
It looks like you had
every angle covered.

20:53.730 --> 20:56.211
This Jalal subject
just came out of nowhere.

20:56.255 --> 20:58.387
Well, thank you.
I appreciate that.

20:58.431 --> 21:01.651
Hey, Callen and Sam just arrived
at the boatshed.

21:01.695 --> 21:04.741
The FBI brought
us a new suspect.

21:05.742 --> 21:08.223
Someone who knew Jalal.

21:08.267 --> 21:10.530
There you go.

21:10.573 --> 21:11.835
Thank you.
Yeah.

21:11.879 --> 21:13.750
Just so you know,
I helped out a little bit

21:13.794 --> 21:15.099
with those
Comescu papers.

21:15.143 --> 21:17.014
Mostly font selection.

21:17.058 --> 21:18.451
Can't go wrong with
grotesque, right?

21:18.494 --> 21:21.932
Hmm. You know, personally,
I prefer a good serif.

21:21.976 --> 21:23.717
All right, cool.

21:23.760 --> 21:26.154
Okay. Uh, hey, guys.

21:26.197 --> 21:29.853
So, that is Bana Azim
you've got there.

21:29.897 --> 21:33.901
She and her husband own a small
currency exchange on Wilshire,

21:33.944 --> 21:35.424
and Jalal was
a teller there.

21:35.468 --> 21:37.557
Uh, illegally.
His student visa

21:37.600 --> 21:39.298
didn't allow him
to work off-campus.

21:39.341 --> 21:40.516
Yeah, but aside from that,

21:40.560 --> 21:42.431
Bana and Omar
have no criminal records.

21:42.475 --> 21:44.128
Where's Omar?

21:44.172 --> 21:45.956
Uh, Bana claims not to know.

21:46.000 --> 21:49.264
The FBI couldn't find him and
we didn't have any luck either.

21:49.308 --> 21:51.440
The Azims were born in Iraq
but haven't been back

21:51.484 --> 21:53.486
since they left 23 years ago.

21:53.529 --> 21:56.184
They've both held steady work
since then,

21:56.227 --> 21:59.230
raised a family.

21:59.274 --> 22:01.494
They don't fit the profile
of a cell recruit.

22:01.537 --> 22:03.409
That could've changed
since they met Jalal.

22:03.452 --> 22:05.367
Yeah, Sam's right;
we have to consider

22:05.411 --> 22:07.238
the possibility that he
may have turned them.

22:10.851 --> 22:12.592
Have you found
my husband?

22:12.635 --> 22:14.942
Have you found Omar?

22:16.291 --> 22:17.466
How long has he been missing?

22:17.510 --> 22:19.163
S-Since last night.

22:19.207 --> 22:21.949
That's not so long.

22:21.992 --> 22:23.603
He comes home every night.

22:23.646 --> 22:25.605
Last night he did not come home.

22:25.648 --> 22:27.128
Please, are you looking for him?

22:27.171 --> 22:30.087
You two own and work
at the currency exchange.

22:30.131 --> 22:31.480
Don't-don't you drive home
together?

22:31.524 --> 22:34.657
I leave a-a few hours before him
to prepare dinner.

22:34.701 --> 22:37.138
Last night
I was...

22:37.181 --> 22:39.401
making shorbat rumman.

22:39.445 --> 22:41.490
He loves it in winter.

22:41.534 --> 22:44.275
But then he did
not come home.

22:44.319 --> 22:45.929
And...

22:45.973 --> 22:48.279
when the other agents
picked me up,

22:48.323 --> 22:49.455
I thought...

22:51.457 --> 22:52.762
He's...

22:52.806 --> 22:55.374
he's not as strong
as he once was.

22:55.417 --> 22:58.115
He had cancer
last year.

22:58.159 --> 22:59.334
He's in remission,

22:59.378 --> 23:01.510
but the treatments
were difficult.

23:01.554 --> 23:03.033
Maybe he fell
down somewhere.

23:03.077 --> 23:04.861
Uh...
Hmm.

23:04.905 --> 23:07.560
Were you aware that your
employee, Abbas Jalal,

23:07.603 --> 23:08.996
was unauthorized to work?

23:09.039 --> 23:11.041
Yes.

23:11.085 --> 23:13.392
We both were.

23:15.394 --> 23:18.353
Abbas came into
the exchange last summer.

23:18.397 --> 23:21.661
He was about to start school.

23:21.704 --> 23:26.100
He had some... dinars he needed
to exchange for dollars.

23:26.143 --> 23:30.321
We don't see lots of people
from our home,

23:30.365 --> 23:32.323
so me and Omar got
to talking to him.

23:32.367 --> 23:34.195
And he seemed
like a good boy.

23:34.238 --> 23:35.196
Kind, polite.

23:35.239 --> 23:38.242
He became
part of our family.

23:38.286 --> 23:39.983
He even joined us for Eid.

23:41.681 --> 23:44.118
But, uh, he was poor.

23:44.161 --> 23:47.861
Couldn't afford meals
on campus, always hungry.

23:47.904 --> 23:50.733
So we told him, if he could
help out at the exchange,

23:50.777 --> 23:52.431
we would pay him.

23:53.519 --> 23:56.478
We should have
never done it.

23:56.522 --> 23:58.437
You're not under arrest, Bana.

24:00.177 --> 24:02.745
That's not what I mean.

24:02.789 --> 24:05.531
The exchange started
losing money.

24:05.574 --> 24:07.271
At first we couldn't
figure out why,

24:07.315 --> 24:11.058
but... Omar took a closer look
at Abbas' transactions,

24:11.101 --> 24:12.712
and he was stealing it.

24:13.756 --> 24:15.323
So he fired him

24:15.366 --> 24:16.324
a few days ago.

24:18.369 --> 24:19.414
How did Abbas react?

24:21.285 --> 24:22.983
He was upset, but, uh...

24:27.291 --> 24:28.684
You don't think...

24:28.728 --> 24:29.990
Did Abbas hurt

24:30.033 --> 24:32.035
my husband?

24:33.167 --> 24:34.995
Please,
you have to find him.

24:35.038 --> 24:37.258
Please.

24:37.301 --> 24:39.608
DEEKS: How long
are we gonna wait?

24:39.652 --> 24:42.829
We're not even sure this
person saw anything.

24:43.873 --> 24:46.876
Bet she gets
really cold at night.

24:46.920 --> 24:48.356
She?

24:50.401 --> 24:52.534
Or he.

24:52.578 --> 24:54.493
I only saw
a couple blankets in there.

24:57.452 --> 24:59.323
Well, we got
some thermal blankets in the kit

24:59.367 --> 25:02.283
in the back if you want to,
you want to leave 'em for her.

25:02.326 --> 25:04.807
Yeah, I mean...

25:04.851 --> 25:06.983
you're right, we can't
stay here all day.

25:07.027 --> 25:09.943
So, why don't you call Ops
and get a surveillance team

25:09.986 --> 25:12.075
and I'll go drop off
the blankets.

25:17.254 --> 25:18.386
DEEKS:
Kens.

25:18.429 --> 25:19.866
What are you doing?

25:19.909 --> 25:21.520
Get away from there.Hey, I'm sorry.

25:21.563 --> 25:23.783
I'm just leaving some
blankets in there for you.

25:23.826 --> 25:26.263
Who's he?
It's okay, uh,
he's my partner.

25:26.307 --> 25:28.091
We're, we're federal agents,
and I-- n-no, no, no.

25:28.135 --> 25:30.093
You're not in trouble.
You're not in trouble.

25:30.137 --> 25:31.791
We just want to know
if you were here last night.

25:31.834 --> 25:33.923
I don't have to talk to you.

25:33.967 --> 25:35.403
No, you don't.

25:35.446 --> 25:37.666
But I'm really hoping you will.

25:37.710 --> 25:39.102
I'm Kensi.

25:39.146 --> 25:40.451
This is Deeks.

25:41.496 --> 25:43.324
Those are weird names.

25:43.367 --> 25:45.544
Well, what's your name?

25:47.415 --> 25:48.982
I don't have
to tell you my name.

25:49.025 --> 25:51.332
It's not weird, though.

25:51.375 --> 25:52.420
It's a good name.

25:54.944 --> 25:57.686
It's okay, you don't have
to tell us your name, then.

25:57.730 --> 26:00.428
Can you at least tell us
if you were here last night?

26:00.471 --> 26:04.084
There was a fire
and that SUV burned.

26:04.127 --> 26:06.390
Whoever did that killed
two colleagues of ours.

26:06.434 --> 26:08.349
So I was really hoping
that you saw something.

26:12.527 --> 26:15.443
They drove off
in a different car.

26:15.486 --> 26:17.532
That's the plate.

26:17.576 --> 26:18.577
You got the plate?

26:19.708 --> 26:21.231
She got the plate.

26:21.275 --> 26:22.493
Nice work.

26:22.537 --> 26:24.408
I'm gonna call it in.

26:26.106 --> 26:28.630
There's a lot of us
living in this neighborhood.

26:28.674 --> 26:30.414
We look out for each other.

26:30.458 --> 26:33.548
When we see
something suspicious,

26:33.592 --> 26:35.289
we spread the word.

26:37.421 --> 26:39.815
I know.

26:39.859 --> 26:41.600
Thank you.

26:42.688 --> 26:43.819
Hey.

26:43.863 --> 26:46.648
Y-You got any more
of them blankets?

26:46.692 --> 26:48.737
For the others?

26:50.696 --> 26:52.611
Absolutely.

26:55.788 --> 26:57.790
What'd you find?

26:57.833 --> 27:00.488
So we've analyzed the accounts
from the currency exchange.

27:00.531 --> 27:02.533
It turns out, Bana Azim
was telling the truth--

27:02.577 --> 27:04.187
Jalal was cooking the books.

27:04.231 --> 27:05.362
How much did he take?

27:05.406 --> 27:06.973
More than enough to fund
the Iowa attack,

27:07.016 --> 27:09.236
with enough left over
for another big operation.

27:09.279 --> 27:12.413
Hey. I got a hit on the plate
that Kensi and Deeks sent us.

27:12.456 --> 27:14.415
This is from a nearby
security system downtown,

27:14.458 --> 27:15.895
10:30 last night.

27:15.938 --> 27:17.418
Send the address to our phones
and to Kensi and Deeks.

27:17.461 --> 27:18.724
You got it.
FATIMA:
Mm-hmm.

27:26.557 --> 27:27.994
On my mark.

27:28.037 --> 27:31.171
Ross, we shouldn't go in
until we have eyes inside.

27:31.214 --> 27:33.608
I don't want to tip them off,
Agent Hanna.

27:33.652 --> 27:35.088
We're going in now.

27:38.091 --> 27:39.483
SAM :
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, go.

27:39.527 --> 27:40.789
FBI!
Federal agents!

27:46.012 --> 27:47.274
Clear.

27:53.106 --> 27:54.455
Clear.

27:55.674 --> 27:57.327
Clear.

27:57.371 --> 27:58.677
ROSS:
Damn.

28:02.637 --> 28:05.292
There's no way this guy took out
Yim and Nelson himself.

28:06.336 --> 28:07.773
Your man okay?

28:09.122 --> 28:11.602
Vest took the round; he's fine.

28:15.519 --> 28:17.521
All right, look,
I jumped the gun.

28:17.565 --> 28:20.133
I let my anger make the call,
it's not gonna happen again.

28:23.005 --> 28:25.616
Oh, guys.

28:25.660 --> 28:27.575
I think I got something here.

28:34.800 --> 28:37.411
You could pack a lot
of assault weapons in these.

28:38.586 --> 28:42.068
Mashriq Army may be
planning a mass shooting.

28:53.949 --> 28:55.037
So we don't have
any footage of them

28:55.081 --> 28:56.082
leaving the way
they came in.

28:56.125 --> 28:57.692
They may have gone
out of the side,

28:57.736 --> 28:58.998
used another vehicle.

28:59.041 --> 29:00.869
You find anything?No, it looks like

29:00.913 --> 29:02.523
the guy he took down
was left here

29:02.566 --> 29:04.220
to clean things up.He did a good job.

29:04.264 --> 29:06.005
Yeah.

29:06.048 --> 29:07.963
All right, people.
Let's move out.

29:08.007 --> 29:10.009
Hey, so, uh, Ross
said they had leads

29:10.052 --> 29:11.706
on vehicles leaving
the area this morning.

29:11.750 --> 29:13.055
We could help
track 'em down.

29:13.099 --> 29:14.491
No, they got
the manpower to do it.

29:14.535 --> 29:15.536
Take these drives
back to Eric,

29:15.579 --> 29:16.493
see if he can get
anything off 'em.

29:16.537 --> 29:18.147
All right,
what about you guys?

29:18.191 --> 29:19.801
I want to check
out that van.

29:19.845 --> 29:22.064
Make sure
we didn't miss anything.Need to move fast.

29:22.108 --> 29:23.196
If this cell is on the move,

29:23.239 --> 29:25.328
an attack could
come at any moment.

29:26.939 --> 29:28.941
Let's roll.

29:28.984 --> 29:29.985
Ooh, got him.

29:30.029 --> 29:31.987
Lethabo Kahn.

29:32.031 --> 29:33.859
Former South African
Special Forces.

29:33.902 --> 29:35.164
South African?

29:35.208 --> 29:36.600
What's he doing
with the Mashriq Army?

29:36.644 --> 29:38.602
Well, according to
his service documents,

29:38.646 --> 29:39.865
it looks like he was...

29:39.908 --> 29:42.911
discharged in 2009
for insubordination.

29:42.955 --> 29:44.565
Hmm, that's strange.

29:44.608 --> 29:46.915
There's no record of him
entering the country.

29:46.959 --> 29:49.788
I thought he might be
Yemeni or Egyptian.

29:49.831 --> 29:51.877
The Mashriq Army doesn't
take in outsiders.

29:51.920 --> 29:52.878
They have to be pure,

29:52.921 --> 29:54.270
from the Mashriq region.

29:54.314 --> 29:55.706
Okay.

29:55.750 --> 29:57.839
I'm gonna keep looking
into Kahn's history...

29:57.883 --> 29:59.449
after South Africa.

29:59.493 --> 30:01.234
Maybe we can make
this puzzle piece fit.

30:06.195 --> 30:08.154
ERIC:
They're tile coordinates.

30:08.197 --> 30:10.199
What does that mean?All right.

30:10.243 --> 30:11.853
Unfortunately, all the files
on this drive

30:11.897 --> 30:14.595
have been corrupted, but because
it was used inside a laptop,

30:14.638 --> 30:17.250
it kept a record
of all Internet activity.

30:17.293 --> 30:21.080
Now, the last page
view used a map API,

30:21.123 --> 30:23.909
so I can... extrapolate
the tile coordinates...

30:23.952 --> 30:25.867
Uh-huh?

30:25.911 --> 30:26.999
I'll do that now.
Yeah.

30:27.042 --> 30:28.522
You should--
Thank you.Okay. Yeah.

30:34.223 --> 30:36.617
They were looking at this
intersection downtown.

30:36.660 --> 30:38.271
Okay, so, the Mashriq Army
chooses military targets.

30:38.314 --> 30:41.709
Are there any recruitment
centers nearby?
Um...

30:41.752 --> 30:42.971
no recruitment center.

30:43.015 --> 30:44.059
Mm. Nothing.

30:44.103 --> 30:45.800
Well, they were
looking at something.

30:45.844 --> 30:47.019
Callen and Sam
aren't far from there.

30:47.062 --> 30:48.629
Send them this,
I'll grab Deeks.
Okay.

30:58.552 --> 30:59.858
We're downtown, Eric.

30:59.901 --> 31:01.990
How much longer before
Kensi and Deeks get here?

31:02.034 --> 31:03.557
Uh, they're five minutes out.

31:03.600 --> 31:05.211
Why aren't you guys
wearing tactical gear?

31:05.254 --> 31:06.603
SAM: Wouldn't want
to tip off the shooters

31:06.647 --> 31:09.041
or cause a panic, Eric.Yeah, but if we're right,

31:09.084 --> 31:10.781
these guys have crazy firepower.

31:10.825 --> 31:13.045
CALLEN: We're fine, Eric.
Right now we need to focus

31:13.088 --> 31:15.656
on what they're looking
at this intersection for.

31:15.699 --> 31:16.657
Well, they're
definitely interested

31:16.700 --> 31:18.093
in something down there.

31:18.137 --> 31:20.008
I found the same map coordinates
on two other drives

31:20.052 --> 31:21.183
recovered from the warehouse.

31:27.886 --> 31:29.539
Hey.

31:29.583 --> 31:31.759
There's no military
target down here.

31:31.802 --> 31:34.240
Maybe they're looking
at a civilian target.

31:34.283 --> 31:36.024
Movie theater.

31:36.068 --> 31:38.026
It's the only soft target
I see around here.

31:43.162 --> 31:45.642
Sorry, I just couldn't take
another minute of that.

31:45.686 --> 31:47.993
I totally get why
they released it in January.

31:48.036 --> 31:50.212
I knew we should have seen
the one about the dog.

31:50.256 --> 31:51.474
Always go with
the dog, babe.

31:51.518 --> 31:53.433
I got to use the restroom,
be back in a minute.

31:53.476 --> 31:55.565
Okay.

31:57.176 --> 31:59.091
We need to
start evacuating.

31:59.134 --> 32:00.614
Excuse me,
you work here?

32:00.657 --> 32:02.311
Yeah, I'm the manager,
Sonya Morales.

32:02.355 --> 32:03.617
How can I help you?

32:03.660 --> 32:05.619
We're federal agents...Oh, sorry.

32:05.662 --> 32:07.664
We only have senior discounts.

32:07.708 --> 32:09.231
We're not looking
for a discount.

32:09.275 --> 32:11.407
We received a credible
threat about this theater.

32:11.451 --> 32:13.018
Do you have an
evacuation protocol?

32:13.061 --> 32:14.976
Is this a joke?

32:16.021 --> 32:17.587
We need to get
people out of here.

32:27.380 --> 32:29.730
Okay, great.
Thank you.

32:29.773 --> 32:32.472
I just informed the FBI.
They're heading to the theater.

32:32.515 --> 32:34.213
Sir, with all due respect,

32:34.256 --> 32:36.128
the target doesn't fit
the Mashriq Army pattern.

32:36.171 --> 32:38.043
It doesn't follow
their revenge ideology.

32:38.086 --> 32:40.175
Well, revenge
isn't an ideology.

32:40.219 --> 32:41.655
It's a feeling,
like you said.

32:41.698 --> 32:43.352
And feelings
can be chaotic,

32:43.396 --> 32:45.050
messy, unpredictable.

32:45.093 --> 32:46.790
They don't necessarily
follow a pattern.

32:46.834 --> 32:49.271
Maybe stopping their attack
forced them to improvise.

32:49.315 --> 32:52.231
Okay, they're desperate for
a win no matter what it is.

32:52.274 --> 32:55.408
Tell Sam and Callen to
evacuate the theater.

32:55.451 --> 32:57.497
They've already started.

32:57.540 --> 32:59.281
Okay.

33:07.333 --> 33:09.030
DEEKS :
Sam, Callen, we're here.

33:09.074 --> 33:10.466
Where do you want us?

33:10.510 --> 33:12.033
Cover things out there.
They might try to hit people

33:12.077 --> 33:13.208
on the way out.WOMAN:
That's right, keep moving.

33:13.252 --> 33:15.515
Got it.

33:27.222 --> 33:29.094
I got eyes on Jalal.

33:29.137 --> 33:30.095
MAN:
Everyone, this way.

33:30.138 --> 33:31.922
Come on, guys.

33:37.102 --> 33:39.060
MAN:
Everyone, can you please exit
the building?

33:39.104 --> 33:41.497
Federal agents.
Everyone stay back.

33:42.759 --> 33:44.152
Show us your hands, Jalal.

33:48.156 --> 33:50.289
You don't have to do this.

34:04.129 --> 34:06.566
NELL:
What was that?

34:08.481 --> 34:09.699
Agent Callen,

34:09.743 --> 34:11.397
Agent Hanna,
what just happened?

34:11.440 --> 34:12.572
What's going on?

34:14.443 --> 34:15.879
Callen.

34:15.923 --> 34:18.447
Callen, Hanna, are you there?

34:21.755 --> 34:24.497
You have to...

35:10.934 --> 35:13.198
M-My boyfriend, he was waiting
for me at the entrance.

35:13.241 --> 35:15.243
I'm sure he's okay.
Just stay here.

35:15.287 --> 35:16.679
It'll be okay,
I'm sure of it.

35:16.723 --> 35:18.028
CALLEN:
Kensi?

35:18.072 --> 35:20.857
Deeks?Eric, Nell?

35:20.901 --> 35:22.729
Blast must've overloaded
the comms.

35:22.772 --> 35:24.034
Might take a minute to reboot.

35:24.078 --> 35:25.210
Dan!

35:25.253 --> 35:27.081
Hey-- hey!Oh, my God.

35:27.125 --> 35:28.996
Oh, my God, baby.
Hey!

35:29.039 --> 35:31.172
Look, hey-- Don't move him.Oh, my God.

35:31.216 --> 35:32.173
Don't move him,
don't move...

35:32.217 --> 35:33.435
Everybody stay back.

35:33.479 --> 35:34.697
Stay back.

35:34.741 --> 35:36.134
It's not safe here.

35:36.177 --> 35:37.613
Stay away from
the exits.

35:37.657 --> 35:39.049
Move back.

35:39.093 --> 35:40.660
It's gonna be okay.

35:45.360 --> 35:47.188
Hey. Hey.

35:48.537 --> 35:49.799
Hey.

35:49.843 --> 35:52.062
He's still alive,
but his pulse is weak.

35:52.106 --> 35:54.021
There's C4 wired
above that door.

35:54.064 --> 35:57.155
Enough to take down
the whole exit.

35:57.198 --> 35:59.809
Other doors might be wired, too.Well, we got to get
all the injured

35:59.853 --> 36:01.159
away from this door.
Morales.

36:03.161 --> 36:04.336
Do you have a P.A.?

36:04.379 --> 36:05.685
Do you have a P.A. system
in the theater?

36:05.728 --> 36:07.208
Yeah, in the office.Okay.

36:07.252 --> 36:08.775
I need you to go
to it right now,

36:08.818 --> 36:10.342
I want you to tell everybody

36:10.385 --> 36:12.300
it is not safe
to exit the theater, okay?

36:12.344 --> 36:13.823
Okay, yeah.Do you understand?
Hunker down

36:13.867 --> 36:16.174
where they are,
help is on the way.I'm on it.

36:16.217 --> 36:17.349
Go now. Go.KENSI: Callen, Sam.

36:17.392 --> 36:19.264
Do you copy?Kens, Deeks. Are you okay?

36:19.307 --> 36:21.962
We're okay, but there are
victims outside.We're coming in.

36:22.005 --> 36:24.138
No! Stay back, do not come in.

36:24.182 --> 36:25.618
Why, what's going on?

36:25.661 --> 36:27.707
There are explosives
above the entrance.

36:27.750 --> 36:29.099
We don't know about
the rest of the exits.

36:29.143 --> 36:31.058
And we can't eliminate
an active shooter scenario,

36:31.101 --> 36:32.364
so stay alert.

36:32.407 --> 36:34.192
How do we get
the first responders in there?

36:34.235 --> 36:35.367
They're not.

36:35.410 --> 36:36.977
We'll do the best we can
with the injured.

36:37.020 --> 36:38.848
But nobody else
is coming in here.

36:38.892 --> 36:41.155
You need to keep people back,
do you understand that?

36:41.199 --> 36:42.722
Okay. Yeah.I got the north side.

36:42.765 --> 36:45.246
Guys, stay back, please.
Stay back.I need everybody back.

36:45.290 --> 36:47.248
It's okay, but I need
everyone to stay back.

36:47.292 --> 36:48.771
Sir, hold on, I need
you to stay back.

36:48.815 --> 36:50.295
My wife is in there,
please let me go.

36:50.338 --> 36:51.731
Please let me go. Cathy!

36:51.774 --> 36:53.907
Please let me go, please.Do not go in there-- sir.

36:53.950 --> 36:55.778
Cathy!
Okay, all right,
all right.

36:55.822 --> 36:57.867
It's okay,
it's okay, it's okay.

36:59.304 --> 37:01.871
Sir. It's okay,
give me your arm.

37:01.915 --> 37:03.743
I got you,
all right.

37:03.786 --> 37:06.311
Hey, walk with me, okay?

37:06.354 --> 37:10.010
All right, my-my friends
are in there, too.

37:10.053 --> 37:12.317
I understand, and we're
gonna do everything we can

37:12.360 --> 37:14.971
to make sure she's safe, but you
have to stay out here with me.

37:15.015 --> 37:16.408
Turn you around.

37:16.451 --> 37:17.887
I'm gonna sit you
right down there, okay?

37:17.931 --> 37:19.715
All right, and what
I'm gonna do now

37:19.759 --> 37:21.891
is I'm gonna apply a
tourniquet to your arm.

37:21.935 --> 37:23.371
'Cause you're
bleeding here.

37:23.415 --> 37:25.155
We got to stop the
bleeding, okay?

37:25.199 --> 37:27.245
Can you tell me
what your name is?

37:28.507 --> 37:31.945
Can you tell me
what your name is?

37:31.988 --> 37:34.295
All right, there we go,
we're just gonna keep that

37:34.339 --> 37:35.644
nice and tight, okay?

37:35.688 --> 37:37.646
Just informed SECNAV
I'm sending additional

37:37.690 --> 37:39.909
agents from the San Diego
and Pendleton field offices.

37:39.953 --> 37:42.303
FBI, bomb squad,
and first responders

37:42.347 --> 37:44.087
are all on the scene now
and they're setting up

37:44.131 --> 37:45.393
behind the theater.Fatalities?

37:45.437 --> 37:48.135
Two so far, but we do expect
that number to rise.

37:48.178 --> 37:50.137
I thought this was supposed
to be a mass shooting.

37:50.180 --> 37:53.140
How did we miss this?Callen and Sam have
not ruled that out.

37:53.183 --> 37:56.186
This bombing may be a precursor
to a secondary attack.

37:56.230 --> 37:58.319
Start looking through traffic
and security cams

37:58.363 --> 38:00.626
for anyone who may be waiting
to ambush the first responders.

38:00.669 --> 38:02.758
On it.

38:02.802 --> 38:04.151
Is she okay?

38:04.194 --> 38:06.327
I, I think
she just needs a minute.

38:06.371 --> 38:07.459
All right, I'm gonna
head to the scene.

38:07.502 --> 38:09.287
Keep me posted.Mm-hmm.

38:13.508 --> 38:15.336
Hey.

38:15.380 --> 38:17.207
I'm sorry, I'm fine.

38:17.251 --> 38:20.298
You know, it's okay not to be.

38:22.082 --> 38:23.431
I can handle this.

38:23.475 --> 38:26.216
I can-- I've interviewed
dozens of bombing victims,

38:26.260 --> 38:27.609
bombing perpetrators...

38:27.653 --> 38:30.743
But you've never experienced
a bombing yourself.

38:32.745 --> 38:34.268
I just don't know what to do.

38:34.312 --> 38:35.487
Mm-hmm.

38:35.530 --> 38:37.315
I get it.

38:37.358 --> 38:40.622
How about you help us sort
through some of this footage?

38:40.666 --> 38:42.145
Yeah?

38:42.189 --> 38:43.321
Okay.

38:58.379 --> 39:00.773
There you go.Agent Callen.

39:00.816 --> 39:03.471
This woman needs help.I'll be right back.

39:05.212 --> 39:06.909
Baby. Baby,
are you okay?

39:06.953 --> 39:08.476
Annie...

39:09.564 --> 39:11.218
Try not to talk, okay?

39:13.307 --> 39:14.526
Hey.Oh, my God.

39:14.569 --> 39:16.354
You hang in there.

39:16.397 --> 39:19.139
Please...
It's so hard
to breathe.

39:19.182 --> 39:20.880
G.

39:20.923 --> 39:23.535
Here. Just keep the pressure
on it, okay?
Okay.

39:25.580 --> 39:27.756
Some of these people in here
are not gonna make it

39:27.800 --> 39:29.802
if we don't get 'em
to a hospital soon.

39:29.845 --> 39:31.412
Kens, Deeks, what's going on
with the bomb squad?

39:31.456 --> 39:33.719
DEEKS:
Yeah, it's not good.

39:33.762 --> 39:35.373
We got two more exits
wired with explosives.

39:35.416 --> 39:36.722
They're checking the
last one right now,

39:36.765 --> 39:37.984
but it's probably
the same thing.

39:38.027 --> 39:39.420
I don't think you're
getting out of there

39:39.464 --> 39:40.726
any time soon, Callen.

39:47.602 --> 39:49.212
Nell, Eric.

39:49.256 --> 39:50.997
You need to see this.

39:51.040 --> 39:53.434
I've been monitoring the
Mashriq Army's online presence.

39:53.478 --> 39:54.479
They just posted this.

39:57.220 --> 39:59.484
Citizens of Los Angeles.

40:00.833 --> 40:05.925
You have just felt the wrath
of the Mashriq Army.

40:05.968 --> 40:07.492
A mere taste

40:07.535 --> 40:12.410
of what your government
has inflicted upon our people.

40:16.109 --> 40:20.461
But do not begin
your grieving...

40:20.505 --> 40:22.245
just yet.

40:22.289 --> 40:25.814
For this is not the end
of your pain.

40:27.642 --> 40:29.122
There is much more to come.

40:31.864 --> 40:34.040
We promise you...

40:34.083 --> 40:36.651
before this day is over...

40:36.695 --> 40:40.176
you and your city...

40:40.220 --> 40:43.528
will know only death
and destruction.

40:46.487 --> 40:48.489
No one...

40:48.533 --> 40:50.535
is safe.
