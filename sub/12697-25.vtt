- Lauren Ackerman?

22:25.377 --> 22:29.081
- Yes, who are you people?
- FBI. You're under arrest.

22:29.147 --> 22:30.816
- Arrest? For what?

22:30.882 --> 22:32.651
- Five hundred counts
for illegally downloading music

22:32.718 --> 22:34.686
on the internet.

22:36.655 --> 22:38.123
- You have no proof!

22:38.190 --> 22:39.858
- Yes we do. Ma'am?

22:41.860 --> 22:44.496
- I believe all the proof
we need is on this Pear Pod.

22:44.563 --> 22:46.998
- And you admitted it last
night on those kids' web show.

22:47.065 --> 22:48.800
- Which we recorded.
- You set me up!

22:48.867 --> 22:50.035
- That's a lie!

22:50.102 --> 22:52.604
- No, we set her up.
- Oh, yeah.

22:52.671 --> 22:54.439
- Oh!

22:54.506 --> 22:58.777
[cheers and applause]

22:58.844 --> 23:00.178
- So now what do we do?

23:00.245 --> 23:01.747
{\an8}- We should probably tell
Principal Franklin

23:01.813 --> 23:04.382
{\an8}that our teacher's
been arrested.

23:04.449 --> 23:06.318
{\an8}- Or we could go ice skating!

23:06.384 --> 23:08.720
{\an8}[cheers]

23:16.294 --> 23:17.829
- Hey, "iCarly" people,
you guys know how you do

23:17.896 --> 23:23.034
Wake Up Spencer in iCarly.com?
Okay, watch me wake up my dad

23:23.101 --> 23:29.141
with a bucket full
of ping pong balls.

23:29.207 --> 23:31.409
- Ahh! Ahh!

23:31.476 --> 23:33.245
Matthew, come back here
right now!
