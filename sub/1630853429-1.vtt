00:41.008 --> 00:43.010
[soft music]

00:51.819 --> 00:54.822
All right, already.
I'm doing it.

00:57.291 --> 00:59.026
So much for spring break.

00:59.160 --> 01:01.028
[chicken clucking]

01:04.298 --> 01:05.599
[cow moos]

01:12.606 --> 01:14.175
Keep it down.
I'm not in the mood.

01:14.308 --> 01:16.676
[cow moos]

01:28.256 --> 01:30.858
[pig squealing]

01:33.194 --> 01:34.394
I'm sorry, boy,

01:35.029 --> 01:37.631
but Mom has a feed delivery
coming tomorrow.

01:39.233 --> 01:41.701
[pig grunting]

01:42.937 --> 01:45.139
Hamlet, you're going
to get me in a lot of trouble.

01:45.273 --> 01:46.807
[pig squealing]

01:49.310 --> 01:50.777
[woman]
Alex?

01:50.912 --> 01:52.914
Shh. Shh. Quiet. Quiet.

01:55.983 --> 01:57.184
[cow moos]

01:58.585 --> 01:59.954
Alex?

02:00.087 --> 02:01.588
[pig squeals]

02:04.325 --> 02:05.659
What did I say?

02:06.526 --> 02:07.727
It was just...

02:07.862 --> 02:09.297
He looked so hungry.

02:09.429 --> 02:11.431
[chuckles] He's a pig, Alex.

02:12.465 --> 02:15.069
And one of us
has to be firm with him,
and it's not gonna be me.

02:15.202 --> 02:16.103
[Alex chuckles]

02:18.172 --> 02:19.874
You are filthy, girl.

02:22.575 --> 02:24.744
Still Daddy's little lady.

02:26.147 --> 02:28.816
Make sure you put his boots back
by my bed, okay?

02:29.783 --> 02:30.851
They smell pretty bad.

02:30.985 --> 02:32.186
[chuckles]

02:32.320 --> 02:33.720
That's the best smell ever.

02:33.854 --> 02:35.722
You are so weird, Mom.

02:39.093 --> 02:42.964
You know, Dad always said
the land will provide.

02:44.398 --> 02:47.767
Yeah. But Dad probably
would've wanted to eat Hamlet.

02:47.902 --> 02:51.504
[chuckles] He would
not eat your show pig, hon.

02:52.706 --> 02:53.908
You finish up your chores

02:54.041 --> 02:56.410
and actually
take a shower today.

02:56.743 --> 02:57.577
Yes, ma'am.

02:57.711 --> 02:59.013
And don't tell Princess,

02:59.146 --> 03:01.115
but I'll bring home
cheeseburgers for dinner.

03:10.391 --> 03:12.226
[soft music]

03:16.730 --> 03:18.132
[dog whines]

03:22.535 --> 03:24.005

[dog barking]

03:33.280 --> 03:35.049
-[dog whimpers]
-What is it, girl?

03:35.182 --> 03:36.516
[dog whimpers]

03:37.184 --> 03:38.752
[rapid gunfire]

03:39.286 --> 03:41.554
-[gunfire continues]
-[dog whimpers]

03:45.493 --> 03:47.261
[dog whimpers]

03:58.439 --> 04:00.673
[siren wailing]

04:03.743 --> 04:05.846
[policeman]
You forget your helmet, Alex?

04:06.613 --> 04:08.082
I didn't forget it.

04:08.215 --> 04:10.017
How is the egg business?

04:10.518 --> 04:11.651
Slow.

04:12.719 --> 04:15.289
Hey, Ethan.
What are you doing?

04:16.223 --> 04:17.257
Killing zombies.

04:20.060 --> 04:22.863
You know, we are
trying to help your mom, right?

04:22.997 --> 04:24.664
Our farm is not for sale.

04:24.798 --> 04:26.666
Your daddy was a war hero, Alex.

04:26.801 --> 04:28.969
People around here
take that stuff seriously.

04:29.403 --> 04:30.737
[radio beeps]

04:30.871 --> 04:32.605
[man over radio]
<i>Mike, meet me at Open Ridge</i>

04:32.739 --> 04:35.309
<i>right by Highway 54.</i>

04:36.143 --> 04:37.344
Roger that.

04:38.645 --> 04:41.415
Gotta roll.
Tell your mom hey.

04:41.849 --> 04:43.750
Put on a helmet, will you?

04:44.418 --> 04:45.820
[car engine starts]

04:50.191 --> 04:51.758
[knock on door]

04:56.763 --> 04:57.965
Have a seat.

05:02.602 --> 05:05.106
Now this goes against
my better judgment, Sergeant.

05:05.239 --> 05:07.441
I'm told that dog may not
be safe for anyone anymore.

05:07.575 --> 05:08.843
Sir, I promised Clay--

05:08.976 --> 05:12.346
Clay Sanders
was a one-of-a-kind soldier.

05:12.813 --> 05:14.882
But, this is not protocol
for our military dogs.

05:15.015 --> 05:17.118
Dakota is hardly a pet.

05:22.789 --> 05:24.024
Promise is a promise.

05:25.593 --> 05:28.661
I just hope that you

05:29.196 --> 05:31.232
are up to date on your shots.

05:37.071 --> 05:39.340
You're being
reassigned to Camp Lejeune.

05:39.473 --> 05:40.740
You have seven days of R&R

05:40.875 --> 05:42.843
once you step foot
back on American soil.

05:44.311 --> 05:47.081
Next time I see you
will be on North Carolina time.

05:47.214 --> 05:48.215
Dismissed.

05:50.885 --> 05:52.119
Thank you.

05:59.360 --> 06:02.196
It took me two days
to catch her last time.

06:02.662 --> 06:03.696
[whimpering]

06:03.831 --> 06:05.665
[gentle music]

06:07.535 --> 06:08.969
Hey there, Dakota.

06:11.738 --> 06:13.040
Open the gate.

06:15.442 --> 06:16.343
[soldier]
Yes, sir.

06:18.212 --> 06:20.347
I guess I owe you a lot,
huh, girl?

06:29.689 --> 06:31.158
Heel.

07:14.001 --> 07:15.302
How you doing, kiddo?

07:15.970 --> 07:19.240
You, uh, you hungry?

07:19.373 --> 07:22.176
I work on a farm that's
going out of business, Grandpa.

07:22.775 --> 07:24.078
Yes, I'm hungry.

07:24.211 --> 07:25.679
I bet you're just saying that
so you can sneak

07:25.813 --> 07:27.381
a candy bar back to Hamlet.

07:27.514 --> 07:28.682
Maybe.

07:29.316 --> 07:31.385
Farms cost
a lot of dough, kiddo.

07:31.518 --> 07:33.220
The last two harvests,

07:33.354 --> 07:34.622
slim pickings,

07:35.155 --> 07:37.358
hurt a lot of farmers
around here.

07:38.392 --> 07:42.062
That's why I came here
to talk business
with you, Grandpa.

07:42.196 --> 07:45.366
Business, huh? Sounds serious.

07:46.200 --> 07:48.002
Tell me, how has your, uh,

07:49.003 --> 07:50.638
how is your mama doing?

07:51.105 --> 07:52.906
How come you two
don't talk much?

07:54.141 --> 07:57.845
You know, I just decided
to give her a little space

07:57.978 --> 08:00.948
with everything you guys
have been going through.

08:01.715 --> 08:05.352
So, what'd you have in mind?
Lemonade stand? Car wash?

08:05.486 --> 08:06.553
Selling cookies?

08:06.687 --> 08:08.222
You're gonna need a calculator.

08:08.856 --> 08:10.491
Pen and pencil
will do just fine.

08:10.924 --> 08:13.093
I have to help my mom
save our farm.

08:15.729 --> 08:19.333
Well, then, looks like
we're gonna need
a calculator after all.

08:20.067 --> 08:21.368
With a lot of zeros.

08:22.603 --> 08:24.271
Step into my office.

08:27.875 --> 08:30.277
So much
for catching the bad guys.

08:33.047 --> 08:35.149
[engine rumbles]

08:36.650 --> 08:38.986
What in the world is that?

08:40.087 --> 08:41.688
[engine revs]

08:42.456 --> 08:44.458
Bad guys can hear you coming
a mile away.

08:45.459 --> 08:48.095
Survival of the fittest,
little brother.

08:48.762 --> 08:51.465
Gotta be fast, strong and loud.

08:51.598 --> 08:53.233
Or become extinct.

08:55.769 --> 08:56.904
What's he doing in the car?

08:57.404 --> 08:58.639
[Mike]
Spring break week.

08:58.772 --> 08:59.973
Bring your kid to work day.

09:00.107 --> 09:01.542
Bring your kid to work day?

09:02.142 --> 09:03.310
What is the world coming to?

09:03.444 --> 09:05.212
You're gonna
make that boy soft, Mike.

09:05.346 --> 09:06.680
Softness gets you nowhere.

09:07.514 --> 09:09.350
'Cause you did
such a good job with your kids.

09:09.483 --> 09:13.854
Hey. My ex sabotaged me
with my own kids.

09:14.788 --> 09:17.624
And that was a long time ago.

09:18.192 --> 09:20.594
Well, I'm sorry, Jack.
I didn't mean nothing by it.

09:20.728 --> 09:22.196
[exhales] Now, look,

09:22.329 --> 09:26.266
I know I can be a little, uh,
rough around the edges

09:26.934 --> 09:28.135
but my intentions are good.

09:28.569 --> 09:30.604
Took care of you and Mama
when Daddy...

09:33.974 --> 09:35.509
He was a good man.

09:35.976 --> 09:37.878
Worked too hard. Gone too soon.

09:38.545 --> 09:40.948
But that ain't gonna
happen to us, little brother.
You know why?

09:41.081 --> 09:42.249
Why, Jack?

09:42.383 --> 09:45.886
Because of that land
right out there.

09:46.720 --> 09:48.622
That, Mike, is our future.

09:49.656 --> 09:51.725
Yours, mine, Ethan's.

09:52.126 --> 09:54.294
That land belongs
to Kate Sanders now.

09:54.428 --> 09:56.263
She can't afford
to keep the farm.

09:56.630 --> 09:59.933
Renting the land out
for others to grow crops
ain't gonna cut it.

10:00.601 --> 10:02.269
Why do you
want their land, Jack?

10:02.403 --> 10:05.606
They don't want to sell.
You can't take it.

10:05.739 --> 10:07.241
I ain't gonna take it.

10:08.409 --> 10:10.177
I ain't gonna steal it.

10:11.912 --> 10:12.980
I'm gonna buy it.

10:14.181 --> 10:17.684
I just want to help her
and her little girl
get on with their lives.

10:18.519 --> 10:21.823
Just don't do something stupid
we can't fix.

10:22.256 --> 10:23.957
They're nice people.

10:27.694 --> 10:29.363
So are we, little brother.

10:30.764 --> 10:32.499
So are we.

10:33.500 --> 10:35.669
[engine revving]

10:40.407 --> 10:43.812
Well, it's a good thing
there hasn't been
a fire this year.

10:43.944 --> 10:45.112
You gonna be able to fix it?

10:45.245 --> 10:46.613
I'll make her run.

10:47.114 --> 10:48.682
Can't promise for how long.

10:49.116 --> 10:50.517
It is what it is.

10:51.051 --> 10:54.254
Town doesn't have a budget
for a new one for five years.

10:54.388 --> 10:57.658
For the life of me,
I don't understand
why you took this job, Kate.

10:57.791 --> 10:59.426
Well, someone has to help out.

10:59.560 --> 11:01.128
Mm, I reckon.

11:01.728 --> 11:03.130
[engine rumbles]

11:03.664 --> 11:04.598
[groans]

11:09.303 --> 11:10.604
And here we are wondering why

11:10.737 --> 11:12.773
we don't have money
for a new fire truck?

11:12.907 --> 11:14.007
[engine shuts off]

11:16.643 --> 11:17.611
Oo-wee!

11:20.681 --> 11:21.982
Ain't she a beauty?

11:24.886 --> 11:26.821
She gonna be ready
for the May Day parade?

11:27.221 --> 11:29.122
-If we tow it, yes.
-[chuckles]

11:29.256 --> 11:30.057
[Jack]
Hmm.

11:30.190 --> 11:31.325
Maybe what we need to do

11:31.458 --> 11:33.293
is find ourselves
a new mechanic.

11:35.462 --> 11:37.531
Kate, mind if we speak?

11:38.599 --> 11:39.666
Sure.

11:41.803 --> 11:45.239
Did you, uh,
take a look at the offer?

11:45.372 --> 11:48.408
I have. I appreciate it.

11:48.542 --> 11:50.912
But, uh, we ain't selling.

11:51.445 --> 11:55.884
Oh, dear, I mean, [chuckles]
you realize you're not gonna
see money like that.

11:56.416 --> 11:58.285
Not for that piece of land.
Definitely.

11:58.418 --> 12:01.154
And really, I'm doing
it out of respect for Clay.

12:01.588 --> 12:04.358
Word is you're thinking
of taking Clay's life insurance

12:04.491 --> 12:06.861
and putting it away
for Alex's college.

12:06.995 --> 12:09.363
So, Kate,
Kate, you take my deal,

12:09.496 --> 12:11.398
you're not gonna
have to worry about money.

12:12.065 --> 12:13.100
All you gotta do is sign it.

12:13.233 --> 12:14.701
I'm gonna take care of the rest.

12:14.836 --> 12:16.703
I think you gotta
let it go, Sheriff.

12:16.838 --> 12:18.205
I better let it go?

12:18.705 --> 12:19.606
Yeah.

12:20.107 --> 12:21.475
Let it go.

12:21.976 --> 12:22.944
Yeah.

12:23.310 --> 12:25.245
That was my family land
for generations.

12:25.379 --> 12:27.648
before your father-in-law
stole it.

12:31.118 --> 12:32.386
From my daddy.

12:33.520 --> 12:35.656
My father-in-law,
he paid a fair price.

12:35.789 --> 12:37.324
Mm, Kate.

12:37.992 --> 12:41.194
No. You're at the bottom
of the hill looking up.

12:42.262 --> 12:44.064
Well, I think we'll manage.

12:45.198 --> 12:48.002
I just hate
to see you lose it all.

12:48.435 --> 12:50.404
So, tell you what I'm gonna do.

12:51.005 --> 12:53.106
Give you some more time
to think about it.

12:54.107 --> 12:55.342
Okay then.

12:55.776 --> 12:56.677
Okay.

12:57.845 --> 12:58.913
Good day, Kate.

12:59.546 --> 13:00.882
Have a good day, Sheriff.

13:01.015 --> 13:03.250
[car door opens and closes]

13:04.018 --> 13:05.218
[engine revving]

13:10.024 --> 13:12.192
[sighs and clears throat]

13:12.994 --> 13:15.228
[mellow music]

14:13.988 --> 14:14.856
How bad is it?

14:15.589 --> 14:17.224
I ain't gonna sugarcoat it.

14:17.791 --> 14:18.659
It ain't good.

14:19.660 --> 14:22.964
I tried to tell your mom and dad
when I gave them the farm
for a wedding present,

14:23.097 --> 14:24.531
but, you know...

14:24.665 --> 14:27.701
[sighs] ...your mama
don't want to hear it from me.

14:28.669 --> 14:30.504
It's a beautiful place, Grandpa.

14:32.472 --> 14:33.774
We can't lose it.

14:37.177 --> 14:38.645
It's where Daddy's buried.

14:38.779 --> 14:40.280
[soft music]

14:44.118 --> 14:45.953
I didn't agree with that either.

14:46.420 --> 14:49.957
Should've had
a proper military burial.

14:51.725 --> 14:52.960
Arlington maybe.

14:55.729 --> 14:57.664
You two could have
come lived with me.

14:58.465 --> 15:00.134
We need you, Grandpa.

15:00.267 --> 15:02.736
It's me asking
because Mom won't.

15:08.508 --> 15:10.277
[thunder rumbling]

15:16.583 --> 15:18.820
[siren wailing]

15:21.889 --> 15:23.690
[Dakota whimpers]

15:28.428 --> 15:29.563
Hello, Officer.

15:30.530 --> 15:31.899
Was I speeding?

15:32.332 --> 15:33.901
Well, I certainly hope not

15:34.035 --> 15:37.805

is a dog, sir.

I chose to bury him here.

Dakota hasn't been
the same since.

trying to find him.

You know, I shouldn't have just
dropped in on you like this.

19:49.556 --> 19:50.958
It's okay.

She looks
different than the pictures.

She's thinner. Yeah.

anything that I can do,

to turn the water on.

Tonight?

I mean,

22:36.957 --> 22:39.426
it's a long ride
to North Carolina.

22:40.127 --> 22:41.929
I saw a motel up the road.

22:42.062 --> 22:43.763
I got a few days R&R.

22:44.198 --> 22:46.100

my time driving back.

22:46.634 --> 22:48.102
Maybe stop in Knoxville.

22:49.702 --> 22:51.138

is always welcome here.

Just such a good man.

23:07.855 --> 23:08.956
Yeah.

23:10.858 --> 23:12.725
Uh, when I was driving in,

23:12.860 --> 23:14.195
I saw you got
a big hole in your corral.

It's just so hard
to keep up with everything.

I mean, I try,
but without Clay--

I'm not saying
that my carpentry skills
are as good as my plumbing.

a city boy from Chicago.

At least we got
the best pizza in the world.

Well, I guess you never had
homemade Georgia pizza.

Mister Big City Boy.

30:31.966 --> 30:34.301
Bet you Alex has
a bunch of real life friends.

30:35.903 --> 30:39.473
Yeah, like Princess.
Hamlet. Captain Cluck.

30:41.541 --> 30:43.710
Awesome nicknames. I think.

30:43.845 --> 30:45.046
[barks]

30:45.178 --> 30:46.246
And Dakota.

30:46.380 --> 30:47.614
[Ethan]
Hey there.

30:48.916 --> 30:51.485
Smart, too. Dakota, heel.

30:55.355 --> 30:56.590
[Alex]
Good girl.

30:58.059 --> 30:58.960
See you later.

30:59.393 --> 31:00.694
[Mike]
Bye, Alex.

31:06.566 --> 31:07.835
[Alex]
So, Dakota,

31:07.969 --> 31:10.303
I'm gonna show you
where Daddy used to work.

31:11.171 --> 31:12.940
[Dakota whimpers]

31:18.012 --> 31:19.346
Stairs are probably safer.

31:33.828 --> 31:34.962
No way.

31:35.096 --> 31:36.263
[barks]

31:43.838 --> 31:45.907
You like to dig
more than any dog I know.

31:47.175 --> 31:48.775
[car engine revs]

31:50.310 --> 31:51.946

[barking]

31:58.119 --> 31:59.419
What is he doing here?

32:04.257 --> 32:08.062
Well, looks like
you found yourself a job.

32:08.196 --> 32:09.964
Anything I can do to help out.

32:10.098 --> 32:11.765
[chuckles] Yeah.

32:11.899 --> 32:15.368
Yeah, I'm sure
that you are more than willing
to help out.

32:25.012 --> 32:26.379
[barks]

32:30.218 --> 32:31.318
Wow.

32:35.022 --> 32:37.357
Is there something
I can do for you, Sheriff?

32:40.427 --> 32:41.795
I'll let you know.

32:43.697 --> 32:45.665
[car engine starts]

32:56.010 --> 32:58.712
You know, I hit
a hole in one here back in '92.

32:59.213 --> 33:00.848
I know, Grandpa. I know.

33:00.982 --> 33:04.618
Only problem was
God was my only witness.

33:05.418 --> 33:06.686
Now I got you.

33:07.554 --> 33:08.990
Behold, Alex.

33:09.756 --> 33:10.724
Behold.

33:11.658 --> 33:13.393
-Ugh!
-[Alex laughs]

33:13.828 --> 33:15.930
You, young lady,
did not just see that.

33:16.063 --> 33:17.631
[playful music]

33:20.134 --> 33:22.369
[laughs]

33:23.336 --> 33:24.771
You've gotta be kidding me.

33:24.906 --> 33:27.074
I love it, girl. Come on, girl!

33:27.507 --> 33:29.010
Would you get a load of this.

33:30.410 --> 33:32.312
Look at that.
That was beautiful, girl.

33:32.445 --> 33:34.447
-Nice job! Beautiful.
-[Dakota barks]

33:34.581 --> 33:36.449
Look at that.

33:38.986 --> 33:42.689
You know, it's been a,
been a long time since...

33:43.557 --> 33:45.625
...we had a nice family dog.

33:46.393 --> 33:47.727
-[Monty laughs]
-Yep.

33:48.229 --> 33:49.362
[Monty clears throat]

33:51.698 --> 33:52.900
What you got there?

33:53.034 --> 33:55.803
Found it on the farm.
Dakota dug it up.

33:56.137 --> 33:58.005
Kinda' pretty
if you polish it up a bit.

33:58.139 --> 34:00.274
Now you got
a new dog and a pet rock.

34:00.407 --> 34:01.608
[laughs]

34:01.741 --> 34:05.313
This is what they call
a mulligan, Alex.

34:05.445 --> 34:06.314
A mulligan?

34:06.446 --> 34:08.447
That's right. A do-over.

34:08.882 --> 34:11.351
-[laughs]
-[Monty] Grip it
and rip it, baby.

34:11.819 --> 34:12.719
Oh!

34:14.054 --> 34:15.255

34:25.398 --> 34:27.534
[phone alarm ringing]

34:30.271 --> 34:32.005
Smokey in the trees?

34:35.408 --> 34:36.643
I got this.

34:38.445 --> 34:39.246
I got this.

34:39.379 --> 34:40.848
[dramatic music]

34:51.359 --> 34:53.860
Please start. Please start.

34:53.995 --> 34:55.762

34:56.496 --> 34:57.631
Yes!

[siren wailing]

35:04.338 --> 35:06.673
[siren continues]

35:18.819 --> 35:20.087
Fire! Come on, Dakota.

35:21.355 --> 35:22.489
[Monty]
Fire, huh?

35:23.291 --> 35:25.525
You just leave Dakota
back here with me.

35:25.659 --> 35:26.894
[Monty chuckles]

35:27.594 --> 35:29.063
-[Dakota barks]
-Fire?

35:29.196 --> 35:30.730
[Alex]
Come on, Dakota, let's go!

35:30.865 --> 35:31.832
Fire!

35:45.880 --> 35:47.415
Alice, where's the fire?

35:47.547 --> 35:49.116
-Smokey.
-[Alex] Mom!

35:52.086 --> 35:54.055
[meowing]

35:55.089 --> 35:56.991
They say where there's smoke
there's fire,

35:57.124 --> 35:58.558
but I don't see nothing.

35:58.692 --> 36:00.694
That's Smokey?
[scoffs]

36:00.828 --> 36:03.431
I didn't know what else to do.
He's all I have.

36:03.563 --> 36:05.933
Smokey in the trees.

36:06.067 --> 36:07.201
Okay.

36:07.634 --> 36:09.170
-Let's save Smokey.
-Hurry up!

36:09.303 --> 36:11.439
He has never
even climbed a tree before.

36:11.571 --> 36:13.040
Smokey's a feline.

36:13.174 --> 36:14.342
It's in their DNA.

36:14.875 --> 36:17.577
Like a soldier who was born
to protect your freedom.

36:17.711 --> 36:20.414
Cats, they, uh,
they climb trees.

36:20.547 --> 36:21.481
[chuckles]

36:21.614 --> 36:22.716
[Monty]
Yeah.

36:27.888 --> 36:30.724
Looks like we got
a hook and ladder
without the ladder.

36:32.159 --> 36:33.560
[yowling]

36:35.129 --> 36:36.964

the cat's okay?

Oh, you little rascal.

[scoffs]

37:11.598 --> 37:13.034
-Okay.
-[Monty] Beautiful!

37:13.167 --> 37:15.903
-[Alex] Girl, come here!
-[Monty] Good girl! Good girl!

37:16.037 --> 37:18.072
Oh, you are a hero. Good job!

37:20.508 --> 37:21.308
[Monty chuckles]

37:21.442 --> 37:22.843
Oh, my little baby.

37:22.977 --> 37:25.545
Look who came. I was so worried.

37:25.678 --> 37:26.679
[Alice speaking indistinctly]

37:26.814 --> 37:28.149
Nice job, kiddo.

37:29.716 --> 37:31.419
[laughing] Thanks.

37:32.353 --> 37:34.955
Listen, I know I haven't
been around for a while.

37:35.890 --> 37:37.091
You and me, we...

37:38.059 --> 37:40.194
We haven't had a chance to talk.

37:41.862 --> 37:44.498
Yeah. Yeah, me, me, too.

37:44.999 --> 37:47.368
I just,
I been pretty busy lately.

37:47.501 --> 37:48.803
Alex told me.

37:49.103 --> 37:54.041
I didn't realize how, uh,
things got so tough.

37:56.243 --> 37:57.178
Listen, Kate.

37:59.579 --> 38:00.915
I want to say I'm sorry

38:01.048 --> 38:03.317
for the way
I handled Clay's funeral, okay?

38:03.451 --> 38:04.919
That was your decision.

38:06.020 --> 38:07.720
I should've stayed out of it.

38:10.124 --> 38:11.292
Thanks, Dad.

38:15.830 --> 38:17.932
You know,
when you and Clay got married,

38:18.065 --> 38:20.234
I loved when you
started calling me Dad.

38:20.835 --> 38:21.902
Missed that.

38:23.971 --> 38:26.807
I just want
what's best for you and Alex.

38:28.576 --> 38:30.411
Who's such a good girl?

38:30.945 --> 38:32.179
I'm so proud of you.

38:32.612 --> 38:34.181
She's just like him.

38:35.149 --> 38:36.317
She sure is.

You're a hero!

[Clay]
Target. Left flank. Get down.

38:54.801 --> 38:56.237
Hold your fire.

38:57.805 --> 38:59.340
Okay, soldiers. Stand down.

39:04.812 --> 39:05.913
Almost back to home base.

39:06.280 --> 39:08.715
Just six months from now
we'll be home.

-Oh, no.

40:29.830 --> 40:31.131
Doggie?

Stay, dog.

40:32.299 --> 40:34.268

[grunting]

40:38.973 --> 40:41.442
[continues barking]

40:56.223 --> 40:57.391
So, uh,

40:58.791 --> 41:00.294
-nothing's missing.
-[Kate] No.

41:00.427 --> 41:01.428
But why break in?

41:01.562 --> 41:04.231
It just...
It doesn't make any sense.

41:04.365 --> 41:06.066
[Dakota whimpers]

41:07.234 --> 41:08.636
[Alex]
What is it, girl?

41:08.768 --> 41:10.770
[Dakota continues whimpering]

41:12.139 --> 41:14.275
Mom, they've been cut.

41:17.945 --> 41:19.113
[Kate sighs]

41:26.453 --> 41:28.422
[Pastor]
But whoever lives in the truth

41:29.089 --> 41:30.691
will come into the light,

41:30.824 --> 41:32.693
so that it can be seen clearly

41:32.826 --> 41:36.230
that what he has done
has been done through God.

41:36.697 --> 41:39.066
[Jack]
Psst. Hey, dog.

41:42.603 --> 41:43.904
Look what I got for you.

41:44.038 --> 41:47.741
Oh, I've got some nice,
refreshing gelato.

41:47.875 --> 41:49.143
[Jack whistles]

41:50.244 --> 41:51.445
That's it. Come on.

41:52.046 --> 41:53.414
Come on, Dakota.

41:54.181 --> 41:55.549
Come on. That's it.

41:56.317 --> 41:58.952
Wow. Who doesn't love

That's right.

42:05.993 --> 42:06.927
[engine starts]

42:07.061 --> 42:09.530
Everybody loves gelato.

42:11.131 --> 42:13.267
As so profoundly
written in the scriptures,

John 8:32.

42:18.939 --> 42:20.541
"Ye shall see the truth.

will make you free."

[laughing]

43:04.985 --> 43:06.053
Come on.

43:06.487 --> 43:08.989
There's only room
for one alpha dog in this town.

43:09.656 --> 43:10.624
And that's me.

43:17.331 --> 43:19.967

-[both grunt]

43:29.076 --> 43:30.043

-[grunts]

43:39.386 --> 43:40.521

43:57.806 --> 43:59.306
[Pastor]
Thank you so much,
everybody, for coming.

43:59.440 --> 44:01.975
Go in peace. Keep the faith.

44:13.253 --> 44:14.621
She's such a good girl.

44:14.755 --> 44:17.024
I know. [chuckles]

Dakota. [clicks fingers]

44:28.769 --> 44:29.670
[Dakota barks]

44:30.671 --> 44:32.673
Is this how you spend
all your Sunday nights?

44:33.875 --> 44:35.242
Pretty much.

44:36.176 --> 44:38.479
There's always something
needs doing around here.

44:39.313 --> 44:40.481
Right in there.

44:43.083 --> 44:45.085
-[CJ grunts]
-Thank you.

44:46.653 --> 44:50.090
Did Clay ever tell you
he was Camden's fire chief?

44:51.258 --> 44:53.260
No. He didn't.

44:53.393 --> 44:55.529
I kind of
inherited the position.

44:57.064 --> 44:59.099
He loved this place.

45:02.236 --> 45:03.737
-Hey, you okay?
-Kate, there's something

45:03.872 --> 45:06.273
I gotta tell you,
and it can't wait any longer.

45:08.910 --> 45:10.210
It's about Dakota.

45:13.447 --> 45:15.215
You're making me nervous.

45:16.116 --> 45:17.618
The reason that I'm here,

I told her you said
Dakota would be okay.

You be careful, he's bad news.

can change so fast.

Yes, it can.

It does.

But Clay,
he ordered her to save me.

she followed that order.

Dakota to the pound.

We did it!

01:01:44.638 --> 01:01:47.574
[exhales]
Thanks, Ethan, that was awesome.

01:01:49.476 --> 01:01:52.479
-[Dakota whimpers]
-[Ethan] You two
should keep moving.

01:01:54.181 --> 01:01:56.250
Oh, uh, one more thing, Alex.

01:01:57.050 --> 01:01:59.520
I noticed something else strange
at my Uncle Jack's house
last night.

01:01:59.653 --> 01:02:02.356
He has some kind
of geology chart
and map of the town.

01:02:02.489 --> 01:02:04.391
He had the Sanders' Farm
circled on it.

01:02:04.525 --> 01:02:06.426
-[Dakota barks]
-Thanks, Ethan.

01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:08.195
I, I know you didn't
have to tell me that.

01:02:08.328 --> 01:02:09.998
Now get out of here
and be careful.

01:02:10.130 --> 01:02:11.331
Okay.

01:02:13.166 --> 01:02:16.503
Coming through.
Let's go, Dakota.

01:02:18.238 --> 01:02:19.573

[CJ grunts]

01:02:40.561 --> 01:02:42.362
I've made you some coffee.

01:02:43.630 --> 01:02:44.598
Thanks.

01:02:45.532 --> 01:02:47.367
You sure you have to leave now?

01:02:52.807 --> 01:02:55.442
-[Dakota barks]
-Told you she'd be back.

01:02:56.844 --> 01:02:58.880
-Where did you find her?
-[CJ] Hi, girl.

01:02:59.013 --> 01:03:00.514
-Long story.
-[Dakota whines]

01:03:02.249 --> 01:03:03.617
CJ, where you going?

01:03:05.954 --> 01:03:07.487
I gotta go, little lady.

01:03:07.922 --> 01:03:09.389
I gotta get back to work.

01:03:09.824 --> 01:03:11.191
Well, you can work here.

01:03:12.459 --> 01:03:14.595
Uh, it doesn't work that way.

01:03:15.662 --> 01:03:17.631
But we'll see you again,
won't we?

01:03:19.366 --> 01:03:20.500
No goodbyes.

01:03:20.634 --> 01:03:21.869
No goodbyes.

01:03:23.670 --> 01:03:24.839

01:03:33.915 --> 01:03:35.549
[whimpering]

01:03:37.384 --> 01:03:38.619
Take care of Dakota.

01:03:40.054 --> 01:03:40.888
Of course.

01:03:41.022 --> 01:03:41.788

01:04:22.596 --> 01:04:25.165
What is the emergency?

01:04:27.434 --> 01:04:29.703
[laughs]
Take it easy, bud.

01:04:29.837 --> 01:04:31.638
Well, you radioed in
it was urgent.

01:04:31.772 --> 01:04:34.307
-What? You lose another puppy?
-[blows raspberry]

01:04:34.441 --> 01:04:36.044
This is serious little brother.

01:04:36.643 --> 01:04:38.278
It's time I leveled with you.

01:04:39.113 --> 01:04:41.481
Let you in on a little secret
about this land here.

01:04:41.916 --> 01:04:44.351
Oh, we have
been over this before.
Kate ain't selling.

01:04:44.484 --> 01:04:46.720
The bank forecloses on Friday.

01:04:47.155 --> 01:04:49.456
What? How do you know that?

01:04:49.589 --> 01:04:52.325
I know everything
that goes on in my town.

01:04:52.994 --> 01:04:54.929
Why have you had it
in for them all these years?

01:04:55.063 --> 01:04:59.633
Well, there's history here,
little brother.

01:05:03.670 --> 01:05:05.672
-Take a look at that.
-Oh.

01:05:05.807 --> 01:05:08.608
Great. Nice rock.

01:05:11.545 --> 01:05:12.880
Those are diamonds.

01:05:14.115 --> 01:05:15.850
-Diamonds?
-Hmm.

01:05:16.383 --> 01:05:17.919
Where did you find this?

01:05:18.452 --> 01:05:20.188
The story goes,

01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:24.158
a miner found diamonds
near here in the 1800s
in Hall County.

01:05:24.591 --> 01:05:26.326
Pop found that piece

01:05:26.460 --> 01:05:29.529
just before Monty Sanders
took over the deed.

01:05:31.598 --> 01:05:32.867
Well, I did not know that.

01:05:33.300 --> 01:05:34.534
Well, you were young.

01:05:35.669 --> 01:05:37.571
But I swore to him
before he passed

01:05:37.704 --> 01:05:40.240
that I would get the land
back in the Danforth name.

01:05:40.373 --> 01:05:42.576
This has been your plan
the whole time?

01:05:48.515 --> 01:05:50.017
Whatever's out there,

01:05:50.918 --> 01:05:52.419
diamonds or not,

01:05:53.386 --> 01:05:56.256
legally belongs
to Kate and Alex.

01:05:56.389 --> 01:05:57.691
Oh, come on, Mike.

01:05:58.291 --> 01:06:01.095
I don't like
what happened to Clay
any more than you do.

01:06:01.229 --> 01:06:04.232
There's times in your life
that you gotta step up, man.

01:06:04.364 --> 01:06:05.465
This time--

01:06:10.604 --> 01:06:12.006
Oh, look who's here.

01:06:12.539 --> 01:06:14.008
Look who's here.

01:06:14.674 --> 01:06:16.576
You know, that CJ fellow
left this morning.

01:06:16.710 --> 01:06:18.578
Now it's time
for this dog to go.

01:06:19.113 --> 01:06:21.748
We don't need anything else
getting dug up around here.

01:06:24.317 --> 01:06:28.555
Are you sure
this isn't more about revenge
than diamonds, Sheriff?

01:06:31.391 --> 01:06:32.726
I'm warning you.

01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:36.130
If you're not gonna help me,
stay out of my way.

01:06:36.264 --> 01:06:37.899
[dark music]

01:06:38.598 --> 01:06:40.433
You understand me,
little brother?

01:06:43.037 --> 01:06:44.471
Stay out of my way.

01:07:49.402 --> 01:07:50.637
I remember now.

01:07:53.241 --> 01:07:55.709
Al-x marks the spot.

01:08:00.447 --> 01:08:01.681
We ain't selling!

01:08:01.816 --> 01:08:03.750
If you get foreclosed on,

01:08:03.885 --> 01:08:06.854
you are gonna be
holding a big bag of nothing!

01:08:07.288 --> 01:08:09.190
Okay, I just need another week.

01:08:09.323 --> 01:08:10.925
I, I, I'll find the money!

01:08:12.592 --> 01:08:14.128
[Dakota growls and barks]

01:08:17.497 --> 01:08:19.934
Put that dog on a leash or else!

01:08:20.835 --> 01:08:22.669
Don't you talk to my daughter
like that.

01:08:22.801 --> 01:08:24.537
Oh, come on, Kate.

01:08:24.671 --> 01:08:27.241
Take the deal
while you are getting
a more than fair price.

01:08:27.375 --> 01:08:31.711
-Take it!
-Why do you want our land
so bad, Sheriff?

01:08:32.578 --> 01:08:34.982
Does it have
something to do with this?

01:08:35.116 --> 01:08:36.448
What's on this land?

01:08:39.752 --> 01:08:43.823
Unless you have a warrant,
you are trespassing
on our property.

01:08:45.026 --> 01:08:47.962
You don't want my help. Fine.

01:08:49.696 --> 01:08:51.032
Let the bank have it!

01:08:51.531 --> 01:08:52.799
That's it.

01:08:55.236 --> 01:08:57.504
[car engine starts and revs]

01:09:14.453 --> 01:09:15.689
[Kate sighs]

01:09:17.624 --> 01:09:18.725
It's okay, Mom.

01:09:20.527 --> 01:09:22.363
[sighs] I can't do this anymore.

01:09:22.495 --> 01:09:24.464
No, he's just
trying to scare you.

01:09:24.832 --> 01:09:26.666
I think we have to sell.

01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:29.103
No, no, no.
If Daddy were here...

01:09:29.236 --> 01:09:30.770
But he's not.

01:09:33.207 --> 01:09:34.741
He's not.

01:09:38.379 --> 01:09:39.947
[sniffs]
I'm sorry.

01:09:40.413 --> 01:09:42.850
-Use Daddy's life insurance
to pay for the farm.
-No.

01:09:42.984 --> 01:09:46.120
Daddy wanted you
to follow your dreams.

01:09:46.486 --> 01:09:48.122
This farm is my dream!

01:09:50.224 --> 01:09:51.192

01:09:53.127 --> 01:09:54.095

Um, hi, CJ. It's me, Alex.

01:10:08.442 --> 01:10:10.077
[sighs] If you can,

01:10:10.710 --> 01:10:13.080

what you're talking about.

01:13:32.479 --> 01:13:33.847
Have you gone crazy?

01:13:36.150 --> 01:13:38.052
I'm on to you, Danforth.

01:13:39.853 --> 01:13:41.522
You're trying
to steal my son's land.

01:13:41.956 --> 01:13:45.893
Steal? No. Buy? You betcha.

01:13:46.327 --> 01:13:49.396
I'm gonna buy your son's land,
Monty Sanders.

01:13:49.530 --> 01:13:51.764
There ain't nothin'
you're gonna do about it.

01:13:52.633 --> 01:13:54.168

Where's my granddaughter?

I don't know where
your little troublemaker is,

01:14:00.908 --> 01:14:02.509
but I will tell you this.

01:14:03.477 --> 01:14:06.714
I do not appreciate
being accused

01:14:07.348 --> 01:14:10.851
by the man
that double crossed my daddy.

01:14:10.985 --> 01:14:13.087
Your old man
lost that farm to the bank,

01:14:13.220 --> 01:14:15.089
and I bought it fair and square.

01:14:15.222 --> 01:14:17.091
Go along before I lose my cool.

01:14:18.259 --> 01:14:21.962
Why don't you go tee off,
on the highway?

01:14:23.130 --> 01:14:25.798
You're gonna get
your dirty hands on that farm

01:14:25.933 --> 01:14:27.868

We'll establish perimeter
within five miles
of the Sanders' place.

01:15:11.111 --> 01:15:12.246
I'll put a call into county.

-Ask for more backup.
-[tires screeching]

But I got every unit on it.

01:15:22.189 --> 01:15:24.625
Any idea where she might be?
Where she'd run off to?

01:15:24.758 --> 01:15:27.528
She has never gone out at night
like that before.

01:15:27.661 --> 01:15:29.997
You don't think
someone took her, do you?

01:15:30.698 --> 01:15:31.965
No. No.

01:15:32.099 --> 01:15:33.400
Don't worry.

01:15:33.534 --> 01:15:34.802
We'll find her.

Okay. I'll be right there.

01:15:45.746 --> 01:15:47.748
I gotta go.
Something's wrong with Monty.

are you doing here, Danforth?

I just think this whole thing
has gotten out of hand.

And I think that all of us
need to find a way

the country somewhere?
