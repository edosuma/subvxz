00:00.640 --> 00:03.956
- Where's the tunes, Forman?
- Hang on, you guys. Just one more wire here.

00:04.030 --> 00:07.260
I learned how to speak English
faster than this.

00:07.327 --> 00:10.840
Fez, it's not real English
when you speak it with a foreign accent.

00:10.911 --> 00:12.919
Geez.

00:20.767 --> 00:22.622
Aren't these the coolest?

00:22.687 --> 00:25.022
I can't hear you.

00:25.088 --> 00:27.706
I know. They're the
greatest speakers ever.

00:36.639 --> 00:38.549
Eric!

00:43.264 --> 00:45.118
Oh. Hey, Dad. Sorry.

00:47.072 --> 00:49.047
Didn't see you there.

00:49.119 --> 00:52.829
Well, I guess that's 'cause you were too busy
making an ass of yourself.

00:52.895 --> 00:55.994
Uh, actually I was trying out
my new speakers. What do you think?

00:56.064 --> 01:01.181
New speakers? What was wrong with the
old ones? Those were genuine G.M. parts.

01:02.143 --> 01:04.444
Uh...

01:04.510 --> 01:07.446
These are louder.

01:07.520 --> 01:10.651
Well, just keep your
monkey music turned down.

01:10.720 --> 01:12.575
Go grab your smock.
We gotta go to work.

01:12.640 --> 01:15.128
<i>Hey, Red. Is that you?</i>

01:15.200 --> 01:17.054
Oh, cripes.

01:22.559 --> 01:24.414
Hiya, neighbor.

01:26.080 --> 01:29.625
Can't hear ya, Bob.
I'm testin' out Eric's new speakers.

01:36.576 --> 01:38.463
Not bad.

02:14.463 --> 02:16.984
Boy, quite a day
at Price Mart, Kitty.

02:17.056 --> 02:19.544
First, the price of lightbulbs
dropped two cents...

02:19.615 --> 02:21.590
then Eric was made
employee of the month...

02:21.663 --> 02:25.438
and to top it off, they added Cheez-Its
to the vending machine.

02:26.496 --> 02:28.350
Are you serious?

02:28.416 --> 02:31.350
Yep. Tiny little squares...

02:31.423 --> 02:34.423
with the cheese flavor
baked right in 'em.

02:34.495 --> 02:36.829
Am I really the Mart
employee of the month?

02:36.895 --> 02:39.863
- You sure are.
- Yea!

02:39.936 --> 02:43.481
And they even decided
to throw in a extra 25 cents an hour.

02:43.551 --> 02:46.301
Oh, yes.

02:46.367 --> 02:51.036
I gotta admit, Eric.
I had my doubts, but, uh...

02:51.104 --> 02:54.071
Hell, you've hardly
embarrassed me.

02:55.679 --> 02:57.916
Thanks, Dad.

02:57.984 --> 03:01.148
Oh, this is great.
Whoo. Price Mart rocks.

03:02.847 --> 03:05.400
Oh, Laurie,
tell everyone <i>your</i> good news.

03:05.471 --> 03:09.083
I just finished my first
two weeks of cosmetology school.

03:09.152 --> 03:11.159
And she didn't flunk out.

03:12.511 --> 03:14.366
Isn't that great?

03:14.431 --> 03:17.017
That <i>is</i> great, honey. Nice job.

03:17.087 --> 03:18.942
Thanks, Daddy.

03:19.007 --> 03:21.396
Yeah, but the next exam's
gonna kill me.

03:21.472 --> 03:23.610
We're not allowed to practice
on dummies anymore.

03:23.679 --> 03:25.883
And I have to style
a real person's hair.

03:25.951 --> 03:28.733
Oh, honey, you'll do fine.
We're all here to support you.

03:28.800 --> 03:32.116
Great. So, you don't mind
being my model?

03:34.304 --> 03:36.311
Me?

03:36.384 --> 03:39.515
Oh, honey, no, no.
I... I go to the beauty parlor.

03:39.583 --> 03:43.958
<i>Okay, well...</i>
<i>Well, maybe Eric can help out.</i>

03:44.031 --> 03:48.025
Oh, sure. Laurie, first of all,
always run with scissors.

03:50.976 --> 03:53.758
Boy, I never get tired
of your sarcasm.

03:53.823 --> 03:56.758
Really?

03:56.831 --> 03:59.548
Sorry.

03:59.616 --> 04:02.583
Red, would you like
to be a hair model?

04:09.439 --> 04:13.051
Kitty, I would like
to have hair, period.

04:14.367 --> 04:17.017
But I don't, so... no.

04:20.192 --> 04:24.316
Oh, forget it. I don't even know why
I picked this stupid career.

04:24.384 --> 04:27.351
Maybe it's...
because you're stupid?

04:32.672 --> 04:35.127
Laurie, no.
You quit everything.

04:35.200 --> 04:37.436
You are not quitting
cosmetology school.

04:37.503 --> 04:39.358
Well, what am I supposed to do?

04:41.056 --> 04:44.023
I will be your model.

04:44.095 --> 04:46.877
But you just remember:

04:47.967 --> 04:52.310
Men have their cars.
Women have their hair.

04:53.536 --> 04:56.405
It's like a car. It's valuable.

05:04.671 --> 05:07.540
So, not only are they gonna hang
my picture in the front of the store...

05:07.615 --> 05:10.964
but I also get to represent our entire
district in the national Price Mart Olympics.

05:14.048 --> 05:15.902
That's nice.

05:17.375 --> 05:20.791
Do you think I would choke to death
if I swallowed my straw?

05:20.863 --> 05:22.718
No, it's got a breathing hole.

05:23.552 --> 05:25.406
- Fez, no!
- Fez, no!

05:29.215 --> 05:31.070
Oh, my God. There she is.

05:31.135 --> 05:34.004
- <i>Who's that?</i>
- <i>The new girl, Caroline.</i>

05:34.079 --> 05:36.316
She transferred here
from Sacred Heart.

05:36.384 --> 05:38.238
Or heaven. I'm not sure which.

05:39.743 --> 05:42.198
We have gym together.
She barely sweats.

05:45.567 --> 05:48.731
Someday, I will make her my bride.

05:48.799 --> 05:51.068
Yep, no one likes a sweaty bride.

05:51.136 --> 05:53.623
- Yeah, I hear you.
- So true.

05:53.695 --> 05:56.695
Hey. Why don't you go talk to her, man?

06:06.719 --> 06:09.948
You're the most beautiful
woman I have ever seen.

06:10.015 --> 06:13.877
Thank you.
Your cocoa-brown skin makes me hot.

06:15.007 --> 06:16.982
I know.

06:17.056 --> 06:19.511
I am irresistible.
Would you like to dance?

06:38.399 --> 06:40.308
Hey. Why don't you go
talk to her, man?

06:41.727 --> 06:43.734
Oh, I don't know, Hyde.
I can't.

06:43.807 --> 06:45.662
I don't understand this.

06:45.727 --> 06:48.989
Usually I am...
I am suave. I am silky.

06:52.159 --> 06:54.014
But this girl makes me...

06:55.071 --> 06:57.111
I have to go to the bathroom.

06:59.295 --> 07:01.150
Anyway, getting back
to Price Mart...

07:01.215 --> 07:03.517
- Shut up!
- Yeah.

07:03.583 --> 07:06.583
Oh, my God. You guys are
never gonna believe this.

07:06.655 --> 07:08.728
- Wait, no. Me first.
- Okay, go.

07:08.800 --> 07:11.517
Okay. I, Eric Forman...

07:11.583 --> 07:13.492
your boyfriend...

07:13.567 --> 07:16.414
am Price Mart's newest
employee of the month.

07:17.440 --> 07:19.327
Eric, that's great. Are you done?

07:19.391 --> 07:23.548
Well, yeah. Top that, cupcake.

07:23.615 --> 07:28.765
Okay. I just won two tickets
to the Led Zeppelin concert.

07:32.127 --> 07:35.772
I was caller number seven, and I won,
and we're goin' to Zeppelin on Tuesday night.

07:35.839 --> 07:38.424
All right!

07:41.087 --> 07:44.796
She said two tickets, not four,
ya moron. We're not goin'.

07:44.863 --> 07:47.252
Oh, my God, no.
Did you say Tuesday night?

07:47.327 --> 07:51.899
I... I can't go Tuesday night.
It's inventory night. It's mandatory.

07:51.967 --> 07:54.836
Skip it, Eric. You love Zeppelin.

07:54.911 --> 07:58.424
Call in sick. Tell them your grandma died.
Burn down the store.

07:58.495 --> 08:02.107
You're right. You know what? I'm going.

08:02.175 --> 08:04.247
I can't go.

08:04.319 --> 08:06.588
- Then who am I gonna take?
- No, Donna...

08:06.655 --> 08:08.509
- You shut your filthy mouth!
- Donna, seriously...

08:08.575 --> 08:10.909
- I'm practically his brother.
- I've been his friend way longer!

08:10.975 --> 08:14.969
Hey, you know what? I am going.

08:15.040 --> 08:17.374
Ah, crap.

08:20.799 --> 08:22.872
- Still friends?
- Till death.

08:22.943 --> 08:25.179
I can't go.

08:25.247 --> 08:27.613
- I'm in! Shut up!
- Get killed!

08:27.679 --> 08:30.329
Uh... Eric, are you sure
you can't come?

08:30.399 --> 08:33.695
Yeah, I can't. You know.
Everyone has to work. No exceptions.

08:33.759 --> 08:36.693
Plus, Red and I?
We're both kinda supervising.

08:36.767 --> 08:39.799
- Mmm.
- Corporate America claims another victim.

08:41.183 --> 08:43.038
Eric, it's okay.

08:43.102 --> 08:45.972
I knew you weren't gonna go.
You're a really responsible guy.

08:46.047 --> 08:48.535
I love and hate that about you.

08:51.199 --> 08:55.258
Well, since, uh...
Since Mr. Smock here is being all logical...

08:55.327 --> 08:57.115
I guess I'll have to take
one of you losers.

08:57.183 --> 08:59.517
- Take a loser where?
- Zeppelin.

08:59.583 --> 09:03.325
Zeppelin? Oh, my God.
That's a band, right?

09:07.007 --> 09:09.396
Donna.

09:09.471 --> 09:14.140
In the ninth grade, I did an oral report
on "Stairway to Heaven," and I got a B-plus.

09:14.207 --> 09:16.345
You gotta take me.

09:16.415 --> 09:19.317
Donna, in the ninth grade,
I wasn't a dork...

09:19.391 --> 09:21.278
and I didn't write a report
on "Stairway to Heaven."

09:22.655 --> 09:24.564
And you gotta take me.

09:24.639 --> 09:28.949
God! She doesn't wanna take either one of
you, 'cause she's taking me. Donna, M-E, me!

09:29.023 --> 09:31.063
Okay, you know what?
I'm going.

09:32.383 --> 09:34.423
I can't.

09:42.303 --> 09:46.580
- You hate it, don't you?
- No, no. It's interesting.

09:48.063 --> 09:51.226
I mean, just...
Just look at all this body.

09:56.511 --> 10:00.667
I must... I bet I'm... I'm like...
I'm four inches taller.

10:01.759 --> 10:05.108
I never should've gotten into this.

10:05.183 --> 10:07.191
I'm not good at anything.

10:07.263 --> 10:09.597
No, no, no.

10:10.623 --> 10:14.398
- I like it, Laurie.
- Really?

10:15.519 --> 10:19.097
Thanks, Mom.
Now all you need is a cut.

10:19.167 --> 10:23.674
No, no. No, no. No. Length...
Length is good. Length is good.

10:24.639 --> 10:26.494
Drop 'em.

10:28.863 --> 10:30.718
Oh, hey, did you see this?

10:30.783 --> 10:32.725
They gave me
a Price Mart key chain.

10:32.799 --> 10:35.003
It's got a knife and everything.

10:35.071 --> 10:38.519
Yeah, I keep it in my pocket.
Some of the other guys get jealous.

10:40.159 --> 10:43.028
Look, Eric, I know you're very excited
about your raise and everything...

10:43.103 --> 10:45.492
but I don't want you
to get too caught up in this.

10:45.567 --> 10:47.421
Don't worry, Dad.

10:47.487 --> 10:52.538
I'm not about to alienate my fellow employees
with my award-winning work ethic.

10:52.607 --> 10:55.989
I read the signs in the break room.
There's no "I" in teamwork.

10:57.534 --> 11:00.120
Here's your check, sir,
and thank you for eating at Smiley's.

11:01.279 --> 11:02.805
Ha, ha, ha. Very funny.

11:02.879 --> 11:05.148
You know what, Dad?
I got this.

11:06.174 --> 11:08.029
Take your hand off the check.

11:13.055 --> 11:14.909
I'll come back.

11:16.255 --> 11:19.354
Jackie, why do you wanna go anyway?
You hate Led Zeppelin.

11:19.423 --> 11:21.430
I never said I hated them, Michael.

11:21.503 --> 11:25.911
<i>For your information,</i>
<i>I think Led is hot.</i>

11:30.687 --> 11:34.232
- Fez, is that her?
- Yes.

11:34.303 --> 11:36.954
I wish I could go talk to her,
but I get so nervous.

11:37.023 --> 11:40.252
Fez, you shouldn't
be nervous. You're awesome.

11:40.319 --> 11:42.872
What girl wouldn't
wanna be with you?

11:42.943 --> 11:47.383
Well, there is Jackie, Laurie...

11:47.454 --> 11:50.302
this girl from gym,
another girl from chemistry...

11:50.367 --> 11:53.782
uh, country-western star
Tanya Tucker...

11:53.855 --> 11:55.710
who does not answer her letters.

11:56.958 --> 11:59.958
- Um...
- Okay, stop.

12:00.031 --> 12:03.959
Whatever happened
to suave, silky Fez?

12:05.439 --> 12:08.090
You're right. I forgot about him.

12:09.983 --> 12:11.958
He's hot.

12:12.031 --> 12:14.965
Exactly. So... Go get her, Fez.

12:20.639 --> 12:22.843
Caroline? It is Fez. May I sit?

12:33.182 --> 12:35.638
Okay, thank you.

12:39.231 --> 12:41.086
Great idea, Donna.

12:49.885 --> 12:53.147
Well, excuse me for trying
to buy a coworker lunch.

12:53.213 --> 12:55.318
I am not your coworker.

12:55.389 --> 13:00.091
You're a high school kid
with a part-time job. You're temporary.

13:00.157 --> 13:02.743
Uh-oh.

13:02.813 --> 13:06.042
You know what ends fights?
Pudding.

13:07.005 --> 13:08.860
Just give me seven minutes.

13:10.621 --> 13:13.240
Eric, you gotta stop acting
like a big shot.

13:13.310 --> 13:15.317
You're not the king
of the world, you know.

13:15.389 --> 13:19.797
I'm employee of the month.
I don't have to take this.

13:22.621 --> 13:24.661
This is no good, Kitty.

13:24.733 --> 13:28.475
- What are you gonna do, Red? He's growing up.
- No, I mean your hair.

13:57.661 --> 13:59.571
Hey there, Harpo.

14:04.925 --> 14:08.089
Where's your horn?

14:09.565 --> 14:13.755
Bob, are you making fun
of <i>my</i> hair?

14:18.877 --> 14:20.732
No.

14:22.813 --> 14:25.661
- Take me.
- No.

14:25.725 --> 14:28.245
- Take me.
- No.

14:38.365 --> 14:40.220
- Hi.
- Hi.

14:40.285 --> 14:42.706
- You're Donna, right?
- Uh, yeah. Yeah.

14:42.781 --> 14:46.611
- I'm Caroline. I think we have Spanish together.
- Oh, yeah. Hi.

14:46.685 --> 14:49.554
<i>¡Hola!</i>

14:49.629 --> 14:54.004
Um, you know that foreign guy
you're always hanging out with?

14:54.077 --> 14:57.143
- Fez?
- Mmm, yeah. Fez.

14:57.213 --> 15:00.344
Um, is... Is he... Does he...

15:00.413 --> 15:02.617
Oh, my God. You like Fez?

15:02.685 --> 15:05.206
- Oh, my God. Come on. I'll introduce you to him.
- Oh, no, no, no.

15:05.277 --> 15:07.578
That's okay. I just... wanted to...

15:07.645 --> 15:11.061
I gotta go... use the <i>baño.</i>

15:15.933 --> 15:18.355
<i>Stupid, stupid, stupid!</i>

15:28.957 --> 15:31.128
What's goin' on?

15:31.197 --> 15:34.295
Cosmetology is too hard.

15:35.517 --> 15:37.372
I'm quitting.

15:37.437 --> 15:43.133
Laurie, don't you think I wanted
to quit nursing school a hundred times?

15:43.197 --> 15:47.507
The first time I put in
a catheter, it broke off.

15:50.877 --> 15:52.732
But what if I don't get any better?

15:52.797 --> 15:55.644
Well, you will never know
unless you stick with it.

15:57.181 --> 16:01.556
- Oh, what do you care?
- I care because I'm your mother.

16:02.525 --> 16:04.412
So, I care.

16:05.693 --> 16:09.206
Well, we do start
doing nails next week.

16:09.277 --> 16:11.187
That might be fun.

16:11.261 --> 16:15.004
And I happen to know a few patients
down at the hospital...

16:15.069 --> 16:17.370
who would love a manicure.

16:17.437 --> 16:19.509
- Thanks, Mom.
- Uh-huh.

16:19.581 --> 16:24.949
Yep. It's... It's... It's just gonna perk 'em
right up when they come out of their comas.

16:39.037 --> 16:42.485
Hey, Dad. Good news.

16:42.557 --> 16:44.412
Just got another raise.

16:44.477 --> 16:48.667
Well, good for you,
you dumb bastard.

16:48.733 --> 16:52.345
Yeah, I tell ya. If they keep
throwin' money at me like this...

16:52.413 --> 16:54.802
I might be able to get my own
apartment soon.

16:55.997 --> 17:00.055
For God's sakes,
you're 57 years old.

17:00.124 --> 17:05.426
- Ah.
- Eric, why didn't you listen to me?

17:05.501 --> 17:09.013
If you'd gone to college,
you could've really been something.

17:09.085 --> 17:11.573
Been something?
Whoa.

17:11.644 --> 17:16.565
You're talkin' to the interim assistant
weekend manager of housewares here, okay?

17:16.637 --> 17:18.579
Yeah. Show some respect.

17:18.653 --> 17:22.231
Well aren't you just
the president of Turd Town?

17:30.844 --> 17:32.754
Dad.

17:32.829 --> 17:36.244
I've been thinkin' about
why you went so crazy and yelled at me...

17:36.317 --> 17:38.967
and I've come
to the conclusion that...

17:39.037 --> 17:41.884
you're crazy
and you like to yell at me.

17:41.949 --> 17:43.804
There's somethin' you gotta know.

17:43.869 --> 17:48.124
You're... Well... You're an idiot.

17:48.189 --> 17:51.538
Oh, great. A pep talk.

17:51.612 --> 17:54.100
Look, sit down.

17:54.173 --> 17:56.628
When I was your age,
I thought I had it all too.

17:56.701 --> 17:59.418
Great job at the plant,
nice steady paycheck...

17:59.485 --> 18:02.485
Just enough to, you know,
string me along for 30 years or so.

18:02.557 --> 18:06.583
And for what? So they could toss me out
on my ass when things got tough.

18:06.653 --> 18:10.996
- Dad, I'm not gonna...
- Look, don't get me wrong. I admire your work ethic.

18:11.068 --> 18:14.745
But you deserve better
than Price Mart.

18:14.813 --> 18:17.147
You're a smart guy.

18:17.213 --> 18:20.060
And I'm, uh... I'm proud of you.

18:20.125 --> 18:22.907
Whoa. Really?

18:24.381 --> 18:28.309
- You... You think I'm smart? You're proud of me?
- Oh, geez.

18:28.381 --> 18:30.650
What, you gonna
ruin this now by talking?

18:33.085 --> 18:35.125
Listen, Dad.

18:35.197 --> 18:38.612
If I'm still workin' at Price Mart
when I'm your... older...

18:40.828 --> 18:43.032
please kill me.

18:43.100 --> 18:45.522
- You don't have to ask twice, Son.
- Oh, that's...

18:45.597 --> 18:49.209
- That's my dad.
- Come on. Let's go make fun of your mom's hair.

18:51.836 --> 18:53.014
- Jerk.
- Wench.

18:53.085 --> 18:54.033
- Tool.
- Dill-hole.

18:54.109 --> 18:55.484
- Moron.
- Moron.

18:55.549 --> 18:57.556
I already said moron.

18:58.685 --> 19:00.540
Moron.

19:03.101 --> 19:06.582
Don't touch. Those are for Donna.

19:06.653 --> 19:11.573
- Kelso, Donna doesn't want a bunch of dirty cookies.
- They're not dirty.

19:18.012 --> 19:20.184
They are now.

19:21.309 --> 19:23.959
Hyde, you're dead.

19:27.325 --> 19:29.878
Oh, my God.

19:29.949 --> 19:33.745
Donna, where have you been? The concert
starts in an hour. I'm ready to go. Let's go.

19:33.821 --> 19:37.302
The concert?
Oh, right. The concert.

19:37.372 --> 19:40.668
Well, you guys were so busy fighting
over the tickets, I forgot to tell you.

19:40.733 --> 19:42.620
I gave them away.

19:42.685 --> 19:44.507
- What? No!
- To who?

20:43.325 --> 20:46.838
See? Your cuticles
look better already.

20:46.909 --> 20:50.007
Proper nail care is one of
the easiest things to overlook.

20:52.125 --> 20:55.289
Uh-huh. Real good.

20:55.357 --> 20:58.553
Oh, gosh, Daddy.
I didn't know you were a bleeder.

20:59.741 --> 21:01.650
I'm not.

21:03.037 --> 21:05.786
Um, could you apply
some pressure to this...

21:05.853 --> 21:07.707
while I go get
some paper towels?
