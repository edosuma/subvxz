00:01.952 --> 00:05.150
It's been six days
since the brutal attack on police

00:05.233 --> 00:07.542
at the hands of a so-called transgenic.

00:07.633 --> 00:11.421
Officials are refusing to comment
on the shocking footage...

00:11.513 --> 00:15.870
Yesterday, the attorney for the officers
addressed the media.

00:15.953 --> 00:20.310
As soon as we find the parties
responsible for unleashing transgenics,

00:20.393 --> 00:23.271
we'll be seeking damages
in the tens of millions.

00:23.353 --> 00:28.871
Oh, yeah. I'm sure Manticore is gonna write
you a big, fat cheque for that one, buddy.

00:29.393 --> 00:31.384
Josh?

00:33.513 --> 00:35.549
Hey, buddy, what you working on?

00:38.153 --> 00:41.031
Annie. That's nice.

00:42.673 --> 00:46.188
They all are.

00:49.353 --> 00:51.264
Hey, man, I know you miss her,

00:51.353 --> 00:54.948
but don't you think it's time you moved on?

00:55.033 --> 00:57.024
- You can't see her any more.
- I know.

00:57.113 --> 00:59.104
Especially not now.

00:59.193 --> 01:02.503
- I said I know, Alec.
- OK. OK.

01:03.993 --> 01:06.348
- Hey, little fella.
- Hey, big fella.

01:06.433 --> 01:08.503
I guess that makes me medium fella.

01:08.593 --> 01:09.662
Got you some food.

01:09.753 --> 01:12.187
- Did you get those little pretzels?
- Hey!

01:12.273 --> 01:15.948
Max, come on. I'm stuck here, you know?

01:16.033 --> 01:19.946
An innocent man, framed for
the murder committed by his clone.

01:20.033 --> 01:23.992
I was thinking of selling the story
to Hollywood. What do ya think?

01:24.073 --> 01:27.270
- What's this?
- Fake birth certificate proves you had a twin,

01:27.353 --> 01:31.392
fake passport proves you weren't in the
country when the murders were committed.

01:32.273 --> 01:34.992
This oughta be enough
to clear the charges. Thanks.

01:35.073 --> 01:36.904
You owe me 2500 bucks.

01:36.993 --> 01:40.872
Guy's best in the business.
Same guy Logan uses.

01:41.953 --> 01:44.262
How's Logan, anyway?

01:44.353 --> 01:46.742
I wouldn't know.

01:46.833 --> 01:51.224
Come on, go get dressed.
2500 is a lot of deliveries.

01:56.953 --> 01:59.751
So I'm thinking of swinging by tomorrow.

02:00.393 --> 02:02.588
I'll be here.

02:04.793 --> 02:06.784
See ya.

02:13.353 --> 02:17.904
If God had intended these transgenics
to walk among us,

02:17.993 --> 02:20.143
wouldn't he have said so in the Bible?

02:20.233 --> 02:21.871
Amen, sir. Amen.

02:21.953 --> 02:24.069
These transgenics are the latest

02:24.153 --> 02:28.431
in a long line of abominations
perpetrated by the scientific community.

02:28.513 --> 02:30.629
- Hallelujah.
- Who the hell is that?

02:31.193 --> 02:35.550
That is the Reverend Terry Caldwell,
a man not afraid to speak the truth.

02:35.633 --> 02:39.546
If I'm hearing you correctly, you don't
believe transgenics should be accorded

02:39.633 --> 02:41.988
even the most basic human rights.

02:42.073 --> 02:43.825
Because they're not human.

02:43.913 --> 02:45.585
Tell it, Terry! You tell it!

02:45.673 --> 02:47.823
To the Lord, they're not even animals.

02:47.913 --> 02:52.145
The individuals that we speak of
are manufactured.

02:52.233 --> 02:56.112
They're stamped with bar codes
when they come off the assembly line.

02:56.193 --> 02:58.832
Since only God has the power to create life,

02:58.913 --> 03:03.111
then we must ask ourselves
if they can even be said to be alive.

03:04.113 --> 03:06.024
Not alive?

03:06.113 --> 03:07.865
Not human.

03:07.953 --> 03:11.832
Who are you to sit in judgment, Mr Caldwell?
Have you seen that tape?

03:11.913 --> 03:16.589
Did you see the look in his eyes?
He was scared, cornered.

03:16.673 --> 03:21.463
Despite what people like you are saying,
transgenics aren't that different from us.

03:21.553 --> 03:27.025
- They do feel, they do hurt, they are alive.
- You know what this is about.

03:27.113 --> 03:30.344
Logan's just doing what he thinks is right.

03:30.433 --> 03:34.221
He's reaching out to someone.
I'm pretty sure it ain't me.

03:34.313 --> 03:38.545
They could tell you what it's like
to be afraid, alone in a hostile world.

03:39.193 --> 03:42.230
It might be more convenient
to pretend otherwise,

03:42.313 --> 03:44.588
but in the end,
who does that say more about?

03:44.673 --> 03:44.953
Them, or us?

03:44.953 --> 03:47.865
Them, or us?

03:48.633 --> 03:52.706
This has been a Streaming Freedom
Video bulletin. Peace. Out.

03:54.393 --> 03:59.103
They designed her to be the perfect soldier,
a human weapon.

03:59.193 --> 04:01.184
Then she escaped.

04:01.273 --> 04:05.585
In a future not far from now,
in a broken world,

04:05.673 --> 04:08.062
she is haunted by her past.

04:08.153 --> 04:13.944
She cannot run.
She must fight to discover her destiny.

04:49.553 --> 04:53.831
How am I supposed to do my job
when my operation officially does not exist?

04:53.913 --> 04:55.426
This is a disaster.

04:55.513 --> 04:58.664
You wanna contain the transgenics?
Give me a free hand.

04:58.753 --> 05:02.268
We might as well acknowledge
the fact that they're out there.

05:02.353 --> 05:07.871
- With public support, this thing'll be done.
- We acknowledge anything, and it's over.

05:07.953 --> 05:12.469
Congressional hearings, subpoenas...
No. We're gonna make this go away.

05:12.553 --> 05:14.862
We're gonna spin it, and spin it good.

05:15.433 --> 05:18.072
We now have
the Chief of Police in our pocket.

05:18.153 --> 05:21.702
He's willing to give us the body
of a transgenic and autopsy work,

05:21.793 --> 05:25.547
provided nothing like this
ever happens again.

05:25.633 --> 05:29.308
- You understand?
- Yes, sir.

05:41.113 --> 05:44.423
- Thanks, Asha. I appreciate this.
- It was your 500 bucks.

05:44.513 --> 05:46.193
Though why you'd pay off a cop to get your
hands on stuff you could see free on TV...

05:46.193 --> 05:49.230
Though why you'd pay off a cop to get your
hands on stuff you could see free on TV...

05:49.313 --> 05:52.146
This is the complete
hoverdrone footage of the attack.

05:52.233 --> 05:56.351
My guess is the cops edited out
the parts they didn't want people to see.

05:56.953 --> 06:00.070
The cops went after him first. I knew it.

06:01.953 --> 06:05.502
I'm gonna talk to Eyes Only,
see if he can't put this on the air.

06:05.593 --> 06:09.472
Yeah, OK. I don't know
what good it's gonna do, though.

06:09.553 --> 06:14.422
However it went down, what's got people
freaked is what he looks like, you know?

06:15.993 --> 06:18.223
What he is.

06:19.713 --> 06:23.183
I've been living with the idea
that transgenics exist for so long,

06:23.273 --> 06:25.741
I've gotten used to it.

06:29.993 --> 06:33.986
- You heard from her?
- She still won't talk to me.

06:36.513 --> 06:41.143
- Give her time. She's just scared.
- I'm the one that almost died last week.

06:41.233 --> 06:44.191
You don't think that wasn't scary for her?

06:44.273 --> 06:47.583
She's a loner. She's not used
to worrying about anyone else.

06:47.673 --> 06:50.949
This relationship stuff, it's all new to her.

06:51.033 --> 06:54.389
- It's new to the both of them.
- Both?

06:55.393 --> 06:57.953
Her and Alec.

06:58.033 --> 06:59.466
Right.

07:08.393 --> 07:10.782
This is gonna hurt, isn't it?

07:10.873 --> 07:13.865
Lasers tend to, yeah.

07:13.953 --> 07:15.864
Our bar codes are gonna come back.

07:15.953 --> 07:20.504
Then we'll do it again in a couple of weeks.
Don't be such a sissy.

07:29.793 --> 07:31.909
Easy, huh?

07:34.113 --> 07:36.911
I've gotta go. Call me
if you need anything else.

07:36.993 --> 07:39.461
- Take a look at this.
- What?

07:39.553 --> 07:42.113
- You see that car?
- Yeah, so?

07:43.273 --> 07:47.152
When the cop gets attacked,
everyone else runs to see what's going on.

07:47.233 --> 07:51.749
But this guy puts the car in gear
and drives off nice and slow.

07:52.513 --> 07:54.469
Hold on a sec.

07:55.473 --> 07:57.350
Now, you see the mirror?

07:59.673 --> 08:01.425
Look at this.

08:08.233 --> 08:11.225
White... I gotta let Max know.

08:18.193 --> 08:19.546
Guess who.

08:19.633 --> 08:23.421
This is the second time in ten minutes.
Don't you think you oughta call back?

08:23.513 --> 08:26.983
Why don't you mind
your own business? Hurry up.

08:32.113 --> 08:33.865
- Yeah.
- Alec, it's Logan.

08:33.953 --> 08:37.104
Hey, buddy. We were just talking about you.

08:38.393 --> 08:42.272
- Then Max is with you?
- Yeah. She's right here. Hang on a second.

08:48.753 --> 08:51.506
- Hey.
- Hi.

08:51.873 --> 08:54.182
What is it, Logan?

08:54.273 --> 08:57.310
There's a connection
between White and the transgenic.

08:57.393 --> 09:02.672
- I have footage that puts White at the scene.
- He was probably looking to take him down.

09:02.753 --> 09:07.383
He sat and watched. In fact, he looked
pretty pleased with how it went down.

09:07.473 --> 09:09.065
Doesn't make any sense.

09:09.153 --> 09:12.031
The government pays White
to keep it under wraps.

09:12.113 --> 09:16.664
That's right, unless White's taking
his orders from somebody else.

09:16.753 --> 09:20.109
- One of his breeding-cult buddies.
- They hate transgenics.

09:20.193 --> 09:22.707
Could be they'll try
to turn the public against you.

09:22.793 --> 09:25.068
Maybe.

09:25.153 --> 09:29.385
Now, listen, Max... I think we should
get together and talk about this.

09:29.473 --> 09:32.385
- Logan...
- Just business, nothing more.

09:32.473 --> 09:35.385
- I can't.
- Max...

09:36.873 --> 09:40.343
I'll look into it, tell you if I find something.

09:40.433 --> 09:43.106
Till then, please don't call me.

10:25.873 --> 10:29.627
Whoa. You see the size of that guy?

11:10.513 --> 11:12.185
What is it, girl?

11:14.353 --> 11:16.662
Let's check it out. Come on.

11:23.713 --> 11:25.908
Hey, man. What do you think you're doing?

11:25.993 --> 11:29.622
Man, that is sick. Peeping at a blind girl.

11:31.153 --> 11:34.589
Whoa, it's one of those freaks from the TV.

11:38.593 --> 11:39.742
Get him!

11:46.313 --> 11:50.943
We've been looking for this thing all night,
all right? We're never gonna find it.

11:51.033 --> 11:52.068
Shut up.

11:54.673 --> 11:59.224
- Here, tranny, tranny, tranny, tranny.
- Come on! We just wanna play!

12:01.393 --> 12:02.382
Here, tranny.

12:02.473 --> 12:06.068
Come out, come out, wherever you are!

12:26.913 --> 12:28.904
Come on, Billie. Come on.

12:30.033 --> 12:34.504
- Annie.
- Joshua? What are you doing here?

12:38.273 --> 12:41.265
Cans. I'm recycling cans.

12:43.633 --> 12:47.228
I should've known it was you.
Billie dragged me all the way here.

12:47.313 --> 12:49.353
- I guess she missed you.
- I missed her, too.

12:49.353 --> 12:50.229
- I guess she missed you.
- I missed her, too.

12:52.353 --> 12:53.866
You too, Annie.

12:54.673 --> 12:57.983
Then why didn't you tell me you were back?

12:58.073 --> 13:03.101
- From Mantia Coro.
- Right. Where you're from.

13:04.113 --> 13:08.868
I looked it up,
wanted to know what it was like.

13:08.953 --> 13:14.107
- Turns out it doesn't exist.
- Annie, I... I wanted to tell you, Annie...

13:14.193 --> 13:17.708
It's OK. You don't have to lie any more.

13:17.793 --> 13:21.627
I guess I just got it wrong,
and made a fool of myself.

13:22.193 --> 13:23.945
But I won't bother you any more.

13:24.033 --> 13:26.342
Hey! There he is!

13:27.353 --> 13:30.106
Get away from the girl, freak.

13:30.473 --> 13:32.270
Joshua, what's happening?

13:32.353 --> 13:34.708
Annie, just stay back.

13:34.793 --> 13:38.149
Whoa! He's even uglier than
the one that attacked the cop.

13:38.233 --> 13:42.306
Oh, no. No, he's bigger, too.
We should call the cops.

13:42.393 --> 13:45.669
No, the cops won't give
this freak what he deserves.

14:00.833 --> 14:02.266
Joshua!

14:18.033 --> 14:22.265
- Who are they? What do they want?
- Annie, you and Billie go home.

14:23.753 --> 14:26.347
- They're coming back.
- Annie, please!

14:26.433 --> 14:27.991
Don't leave me alone!

14:29.753 --> 14:31.948
Come, Billie.

14:41.393 --> 14:43.384
Be careful.

14:44.153 --> 14:45.711
Careful. Nice and slow.

14:53.393 --> 14:57.466
- I ain't goin' down there.
- Yeah, man, forget about it.

14:57.833 --> 15:01.030
- Let's just call the cops or something.
- Yeah.

15:06.793 --> 15:08.192
Joshua?

15:13.393 --> 15:14.792
Joshua?

15:25.353 --> 15:29.869
A hundred thousand years ago,
some humpback violates a dolphin,

15:29.953 --> 15:32.751
and this is what we get.

15:33.313 --> 15:36.862
Makes a pretty good argument
for selective breeding, huh?

15:38.033 --> 15:42.948
That footage of the transgenic attacking
policemen put a good scare into the public.

15:43.033 --> 15:46.548
I've been leaking information
to certain media contacts.

15:46.633 --> 15:49.306
Little titbits about the Manticore project.

15:49.393 --> 15:53.830
It's the opinion of the Conclave
that you take things even further.

15:54.513 --> 15:58.222
The average citizen is looking
over his shoulder for monsters,

15:58.313 --> 16:02.989
but the greater threat to our interests
are the X-series transgenics.

16:03.073 --> 16:06.270
They're able to pass as human,
integrate themselves.

16:06.353 --> 16:08.423
Makes them more difficult to expose.

16:08.513 --> 16:11.550
Even so, just imagine how people will react

16:11.633 --> 16:15.308
when they learn there are transgenics
that look just like them.

16:15.393 --> 16:18.465
Think of the paranoia, the panic.

16:18.553 --> 16:23.263
Joe Six-Pack finds out his daughter
is dating one, or he lost his job to one.

16:23.353 --> 16:27.346
Exactly. We need to exploit that kind of fear.

16:27.433 --> 16:28.582
Leave it to me.

16:29.673 --> 16:32.028
- Fe'nos tol.
- Fe'nos tol.

16:39.553 --> 16:41.430
- White.
- Otto, sir.

16:41.513 --> 16:46.064
We just intercepted a 911 call reporting
a wolfman loose in Sector Three.

16:46.153 --> 16:48.189
All right. I'll meet you there.

16:48.273 --> 16:52.710
We gotta get on this fast before some cop
makes a scene and the media gets wind.

16:52.793 --> 16:54.784
Yes, sir.

16:59.153 --> 17:03.146
- Good afternoon. Channel Three.
- Bill Leakey, news desk, please.

17:03.233 --> 17:08.590
- Bill Leakey.
- Bill. It's me, your Deep Throat.

17:08.673 --> 17:10.709
Heard the one about the wolfman?

17:28.873 --> 17:32.502
I'm standing with the man who phoned
the police. What happened?

17:32.593 --> 17:36.586
We chased it out of our neighbourhood
and caught up with it again.

17:36.673 --> 17:38.584
The thing attacked us for no reason.

17:38.673 --> 17:42.586
The police aren't confirming this,
but we've heard rumours about a girl.

17:42.673 --> 17:45.824
Annie. It took her down to the sewer.

17:45.913 --> 17:50.782
I'm sorry, are you saying the creature
abducted a girl from your neighbourhood?

17:50.873 --> 17:54.183
Yeah. It took her down to the sewer.
We tried to stop it, but...

17:54.273 --> 17:57.504
There you have it.
The creature kidnapped a woman...

17:57.593 --> 18:00.949
- Blind, too.
- Correction: A young blind woman.

18:01.033 --> 18:05.549
Stay with Channel Three News
as this situation continues to unfold.

18:05.633 --> 18:11.230
We'll be bringing you coverage live
from the scene. Back to you, Steve.

18:11.313 --> 18:13.873
Well, how was that? Good?

18:13.953 --> 18:18.026
Let's go try the cops again,
see if they're ready to give a statement yet.

18:55.673 --> 18:58.870
The thing dragged the girl underground here.

18:58.953 --> 19:03.026
Carson, call DWP and have 'em close
the sluicegates here, here, and here.

19:03.113 --> 19:05.633
I want men at every entrance,
every manhole within four square miles.

19:05.633 --> 19:07.032
I want men at every entrance,
every manhole within four square miles.

19:07.113 --> 19:11.106
Nobody gets in or out. We'll trap it
and deploy from the perimeter.

19:11.193 --> 19:15.664
We search every tunnel until we flush it
back to this position for the takedown.

19:15.753 --> 19:18.745
- What about the girl?
- We assume she's alive.

19:18.833 --> 19:20.551
Her safety is our top priority.

19:20.633 --> 19:23.830
All right, gentlemen, we've got jobs to do.
Let's get to 'em.

19:25.953 --> 19:28.831
Look, dude, I'm a reporter.
Tell me something.

19:30.313 --> 19:34.386
Sir, if you don't move along,
I'm gonna have to arrest you.

19:35.793 --> 19:40.503
Max! Hey! Hey, Max! Max, what's up?

19:41.513 --> 19:43.504
What are you doing?

19:43.593 --> 19:45.345
Wake up, dirt bag.

19:52.113 --> 19:53.512
Max!

19:59.833 --> 20:01.824
Careful.

20:06.073 --> 20:07.552
Where are we?

20:08.993 --> 20:12.781
We'll be safe here. They won't find us.

20:12.873 --> 20:16.149
The water, Joshua. It's so loud.

20:21.113 --> 20:23.343
Wait here.

20:40.353 --> 20:42.389
- Better?
- Yeah.

20:42.793 --> 20:45.432
- So what do we do now?
- We just wait.

20:45.513 --> 20:49.392
Tunnel D-5 is secure. Proceeding to D-6. Over.

20:49.473 --> 20:51.623
Roger that. Over.

20:51.713 --> 20:56.662
The police. We're safe now. They'll
protect us from the men that attacked you.

20:56.753 --> 21:00.353
- No, no. No police.
- Why? What's wrong?

21:00.353 --> 21:01.752
- No, no. No police.
- Why? What's wrong?

21:33.073 --> 21:37.351
Alpha team to Command. D-6 is secure.
We are proceeding to D-7. Over.

21:38.473 --> 21:41.590
Sorry, Annie. I'm so sorry.
I didn't want to do this.

21:41.673 --> 21:46.030
I'm gonna let go of you.
Please don't scream, OK?

21:50.193 --> 21:54.471
Tell me what's going on, Joshua. Right now!

21:56.073 --> 21:59.031
Why are you hiding from the police?

21:59.793 --> 22:03.581
- I can't tell you.
- What did you do?

22:03.953 --> 22:05.944
Not what I did.

22:06.953 --> 22:08.352
What I am.

22:10.993 --> 22:15.828
Police are hoping to force the creature to
the surface, where it can be apprehended.

22:15.913 --> 22:19.383
We have a description.
This exclusive rendering of the transgenic

22:19.473 --> 22:23.625
was drawn from accounts by the three
brave young men who first saw it.

22:23.713 --> 22:25.112
Joshua.

23:21.113 --> 23:24.788
- Sir.
- This is so FUBAR it's almost funny.

23:24.873 --> 23:27.671
- What do you want us to do?
- Nothing you can do.

23:27.753 --> 23:31.632
Go back to HQ and watch it
on TV like everybody else.

23:32.633 --> 23:34.624
Let's go.

23:42.513 --> 23:45.311
I'll have a Fudgy Buddy cone.

23:45.393 --> 23:47.384
Thanks.

23:58.753 --> 24:00.744
What are you saying?

24:00.833 --> 24:04.508
You're one of these things
they're talking about on TV?

24:04.593 --> 24:08.984
Annie... I wanted to tell you before, but I...

24:09.073 --> 24:11.712
I touched your face.

24:11.793 --> 24:13.943
I saw you.

24:18.673 --> 24:20.504
It wasn't me.

24:23.913 --> 24:27.383
- You tricked me?
- Yes, I tricked you, because I...

24:27.473 --> 24:30.351
You took advantage of me
because I can't see?

24:30.433 --> 24:32.503
- Annie, please...
- Oh, God!

24:32.593 --> 24:35.426
- Annie, please...
- Stay away from me.

24:36.873 --> 24:38.272
Stay away from me!

24:54.833 --> 24:57.142
Tunnels J-6 and J-12 secure.

24:57.233 --> 24:59.064
That's the last of them.

24:59.153 --> 25:02.668
There's no way it could've
gotten out. Just no way.

25:02.753 --> 25:07.463
All units return to your initial deployment
points. We're searching the area again.

25:15.393 --> 25:16.826
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey.

25:16.913 --> 25:19.950
I take it you saw the same newscast I did.

25:20.033 --> 25:23.787
- Have you seen Max?
- No. You?

25:23.873 --> 25:25.784
Let me see if I can get her.

25:34.393 --> 25:37.669
Delta team moving to east junction. Over.

25:38.633 --> 25:42.308
Alpha team moving to east junction. Over.

25:55.313 --> 25:57.031
Anything?

26:05.873 --> 26:07.750
Should've put it on vibrate.

26:20.273 --> 26:23.231
Sketchy? Idiot.

26:27.553 --> 26:29.862
Thanks.

26:29.953 --> 26:33.662
T-shirts! Get your mutant T-shirts!
Ten dollars!

26:37.833 --> 26:39.061
- Hello?
- It's me.

26:39.153 --> 26:40.791
- It's her.
- Who you talking to?

26:40.873 --> 26:43.182
- Logan. He's here with me.
- Here where?

26:43.273 --> 26:47.346
Here at the all-American media circus.
Where are you?

26:47.433 --> 26:50.903
- Let me guess. You're in the sewers.
- Looking for Joshua.

26:50.993 --> 26:53.951
What makes you think you'll find him
before the cops do?

26:54.033 --> 26:55.864
Hang on.

26:56.513 --> 27:00.552
I hacked into the police computer.
They're using a GPS to track their men.

27:00.633 --> 27:04.228
There's no sense you going over
the same ground. Where are you?

27:05.873 --> 27:08.341
Junction J-12-R.

27:08.433 --> 27:12.665
OK. Head right at the next intersection
and take a look around there.

27:12.753 --> 27:16.302
Once I find him, we'll need a way out.
They've blocked the entrances.

27:16.393 --> 27:21.592
- Well, we'll figure something out.
- Hey, be careful. White's up there, too.

27:21.673 --> 27:25.348
- We'll keep an eye out. Be in touch.
- OK.

27:25.433 --> 27:28.550
I'm on the scene where
Reverend Terry Caldwell has arrived

27:28.633 --> 27:31.830
to lead a prayer service
for the missing woman.

27:31.913 --> 27:37.351
Now I'd like everybody to bow their heads,
and ask God to watch over that poor girl.

27:37.433 --> 27:39.025
Amen, Terry.

27:42.993 --> 27:44.472
What the hell happened?

27:44.553 --> 27:46.669
- It wasn't the creature.
- Who was it?

27:46.753 --> 27:50.189
Some girl. Caught us by surprise.
Kicked our asses.

27:50.273 --> 27:53.470
- She got away and then took off.
- 452.

28:03.673 --> 28:06.392
Hey, let me get one of those.

29:08.913 --> 29:10.471
Idiot.

29:11.993 --> 29:16.225
- Annie.
- Just leave me alone.

29:17.473 --> 29:19.987
Annie, I'm sorry I tricked you.

29:20.073 --> 29:23.622
I was trying to protect you.

29:24.673 --> 29:26.868
And look what happened.

29:28.993 --> 29:33.987
Annie, we're gonna go to the police,
and you'll be safe.

29:35.633 --> 29:40.707
But they'll lock you up. Or worse.

29:40.793 --> 29:43.023
But you'll be safe.

29:49.993 --> 29:52.632
Come here, Joshua.

29:56.513 --> 30:00.222
- Annie, no.
- You owe me that much, don't you think?

30:03.393 --> 30:05.748
Joshua, I have to know.

30:45.193 --> 30:48.185
No wonder Billie took such a liking to you.

30:49.833 --> 30:53.792
And, like I said, she's always
been a great judge of character.

30:55.313 --> 30:59.272
- You're not mad at me any more?
- I wouldn't go that far.

30:59.353 --> 31:02.106
But I understand why you lied to me.

31:05.953 --> 31:10.231
- Someone's coming.
- We can't hide here for ever.

31:11.313 --> 31:13.304
Come. Come.

31:15.033 --> 31:16.625
Careful.

31:27.873 --> 31:30.023
- This way.
- No.

31:31.033 --> 31:33.831
- No, that way.
- How do you know?

31:33.913 --> 31:36.905
I'm a good listener. Had a lot of practice.

31:38.473 --> 31:41.192
- Come on.
- You go ahead. I'm gonna stay here.

31:42.633 --> 31:44.032
I can't leave you here.

31:44.113 --> 31:47.947
It's OK if they find me, Joshua.
It's not OK if they find you.

31:50.033 --> 31:53.912
Go on. When they find me,
I'll tell them you went the other way.

31:53.993 --> 31:57.508
No. Annie, I can't leave you here by yourself.

31:57.593 --> 32:02.303
It's the only way you'll get out.
Now go before somebody comes.

32:03.753 --> 32:07.063
Tomorrow, I'll come by
your house to see you, OK?

32:07.153 --> 32:09.303
- Promise?
- Promise.

32:09.393 --> 32:11.111
Tomorrow?

32:15.473 --> 32:16.872
Tomorrow.

32:50.153 --> 32:55.227
- It's a war zone.
- We should've heard from Max. Call her.

33:11.073 --> 33:12.631
- Yeah?
- Where are you?

33:12.713 --> 33:13.907
Junction J-42.

33:16.153 --> 33:19.270
- Sector police are heading your way.
- Tell me about it.

33:19.353 --> 33:20.706
Joshua can't be far.

33:21.633 --> 33:22.622
What was that?

33:28.353 --> 33:30.742
You were right. I found him.

33:30.833 --> 33:36.032
Let's get you out of there. There is a tunnel
up ahead on your right, about 20 yards.

33:43.193 --> 33:46.708
- Now what?
- Keep going. You'll see a ladder.

33:46.793 --> 33:48.988
- Take it down one level.
- Down? You sure?

33:49.073 --> 33:52.304
- Max, go.
- Come on.

33:52.793 --> 33:57.423
This is where I'll bring them out. Gotta
figure there'll be soldiers on the street.

33:57.513 --> 33:59.504
Not for long.

34:11.313 --> 34:16.262
- We're in some kind of chamber.
- I was here with Annie before.

34:18.233 --> 34:22.987
There are three tunnels at the far end.
Take the second one on the right. Hurry.

34:25.553 --> 34:27.543
We are resecuring D-6.

34:41.033 --> 34:44.230
We can't get through.
There are too many of them.

34:48.753 --> 34:52.541
- They're coming in behind you, too.
- Roger that. We're on our way.

35:31.513 --> 35:33.504
Let's go!

35:35.713 --> 35:38.352
Halt! Stop!

35:48.593 --> 35:52.666
D-6. We have shots fired.
Encountered subject.

35:52.753 --> 35:56.348
We are in pursuit. Repeat: In pursuit.

35:56.433 --> 35:59.903
Roger. Out. Let's go!
You heard him! Let's do it!

36:28.913 --> 36:30.312
You idiot!

36:31.873 --> 36:35.707
I don't know him. I don't know anything.
He's just an idiot.

36:49.953 --> 36:53.741
You have any idea how little
the cops in this burg get paid?

36:53.833 --> 36:55.824
It's pathetic.

37:07.633 --> 37:09.624
Hello?

37:11.553 --> 37:13.783
Is somebody there?

37:15.753 --> 37:17.744
Hello?

37:21.833 --> 37:23.824
Hello?

37:25.833 --> 37:28.711
Don't worry, Miss. It's all over.

37:44.593 --> 37:48.188
Well, that was fun.
What say we order a pizza, huh?

37:48.273 --> 37:51.948
- Thank you, Logan.
- No problem, big fella.

37:56.353 --> 37:58.503
Need a ride to your place?

37:58.593 --> 38:03.189
Oh, no, it's OK. I got my bike.
Thanks, Logan.

38:03.513 --> 38:05.469
Max?

38:05.553 --> 38:06.668
Yeah?

38:07.353 --> 38:09.821
I just want you to know,

38:09.913 --> 38:13.508
however things may be between us,
I always got your back.

38:15.953 --> 38:17.989
I know. You too.

38:35.393 --> 38:38.544
What's Logan's problem?
Everything turned out OK.

38:38.633 --> 38:39.702
Questions remain.

38:39.793 --> 38:43.786
Community leaders are demanding to know
how the creature could elude the manhunt

38:43.873 --> 38:46.307
with so many law enforcement
agencies involved.

38:46.393 --> 38:48.509
The creature has friends, that's how.

38:48.593 --> 38:51.903
We bring you breaking news
in this shocking development.

38:51.993 --> 38:55.668
Police have confirmed that
the cause of death was a snapped neck.

38:55.753 --> 38:59.063
Witnesses say it would have
taken superhuman strength

38:59.153 --> 39:01.826
to account for the state
in which the body was found.

39:01.913 --> 39:04.791
Once again, a tragic ending
to tonight's events.

39:04.873 --> 39:06.909
The kidnapped girl, Annie Fisher,

39:06.993 --> 39:09.507
was found dead at the scene
just moments ago,

39:09.593 --> 39:12.869
murdered by her abductor,
who remains at large.

39:12.953 --> 39:14.545
Police have a description...

39:16.873 --> 39:19.228
...into the sewers early this morning.

39:19.313 --> 39:23.465
Miss Fisher spent several
terrifying hours with her attacker,

39:23.553 --> 39:26.147
as police tried in vain
to locate and rescue her.

39:26.233 --> 39:28.872
- Sadly, that was not to be...
- Annie...

39:28.953 --> 39:30.944
Annie Fisher was only 23 years old.

39:31.033 --> 39:34.184
And so, to recap, the situation
here tonight is grim.

39:34.273 --> 39:38.744
After an exhaustive all-day search
involving police and rescue departments,

39:38.833 --> 39:42.109
the kidnapped girl, Annie Fisher,
has been found murdered.

39:42.193 --> 39:47.221
Stay with us as Channel Three News brings
you all the details tonight at 11 o'clock.

39:53.393 --> 39:55.509
White.

39:55.593 --> 39:58.153
Fe'nos tol.

39:58.233 --> 40:01.862
Just keeps getting better
and better, doesn't it?

40:05.193 --> 40:09.072
Keep this area clear. Everybody move back.

40:16.673 --> 40:19.233
Once again, the attacker remains at large.

40:19.313 --> 40:22.350
And equally disturbing
are rumours that a transgenic

40:22.433 --> 40:25.072
from what is called the X-series,

40:25.153 --> 40:28.907
which appear human while possessing
extraordinary strength and speed,

40:28.993 --> 40:32.463
may have assisted
in the creature's escape.
