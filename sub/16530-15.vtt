00:01.102 --> 00:01.235
.

00:01.502 --> 00:02.403
- In the criminal justice
system,

00:03.537 --> 00:05.106
sexually based offenses

00:05.139 --> 00:06.540
are considered
especially heinous.

00:06.574 --> 00:09.177
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:09.210 --> 00:11.045
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:11.079 --> 00:12.346
are members of an elite squad

00:12.380 --> 00:14.448
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:14.482 --> 00:16.117
These are their stories.

00:16.150 --> 00:17.785
[dramatic music]

00:17.818 --> 00:21.422
- These three victims are the
work of our pattern 23 rapist.

00:21.455 --> 00:24.292
- The one the papers are calling
"the Second Avenue Strangler."

00:24.325 --> 00:26.460
His victims were all last seen
near bars on Second Ave.

00:26.494 --> 00:28.796
- Witnesses reported seeing
a gold TLC car

00:28.829 --> 00:30.464
near two of the victims,

00:30.498 --> 00:33.401
and we checked with Uber,
QuikRide, other services.

00:33.434 --> 00:35.369
It doesn't match
any of their cars.

00:35.403 --> 00:37.271
- So he could be a guy
working off the books.

00:37.305 --> 00:41.275
- No matter who he is,
he's a serial rapist/murderer

00:41.309 --> 00:44.112
who has struck every two weeks
for the last month.

00:44.145 --> 00:46.147
So for those of you who are
just joining us now,

00:46.180 --> 00:48.316
this is going to be
a joint investigation

00:48.349 --> 00:50.184
with Homicide
and Detective Perry.

00:50.218 --> 00:52.153
- This started as an SVU case,
but you all will be

00:52.186 --> 00:54.088
our feet on the ground.
Detective?

00:54.122 --> 00:56.390
- Okay, the M.O.'s are the same.
The victims are all between

00:56.424 --> 00:58.626
20 and 30.
They're long-haired brunettes.

00:58.659 --> 01:00.361
They had secondary trauma
from the struggle.

01:00.394 --> 01:02.863
They were dropped off
at a construction site.

01:02.896 --> 01:04.665
Now, the cause of death
was asphyxiation.

01:04.698 --> 01:07.201
- All of his vics were found
naked from the waist down.

01:07.235 --> 01:10.338
Their hands were tied with rope,
and they all had a chunk of hair

01:10.371 --> 01:12.106
shaved from
the back of their neck.

01:12.140 --> 01:13.374
- That's his trophy
and his signature.

01:13.407 --> 01:16.210
- Easy marks, drunk
and walking home alone.

01:16.244 --> 01:18.546
- Okay, so get
this sketch out there.

01:18.579 --> 01:21.349
Be our eyes, be our ears.
Go.

01:23.217 --> 01:25.219
We're three days in.
We got a week and a half

01:25.253 --> 01:27.388
if he stays on pattern.
- I can't afford another one.

01:27.421 --> 01:28.856
COMPSTAT counts these
against Homicide.

01:28.889 --> 01:30.691
I got three unsolveds
over my head.

01:30.724 --> 01:32.893
- So we'll flood the streets.
We're gonna flood social media.

01:32.926 --> 01:34.195
Get the sketch out there.

01:34.228 --> 01:36.430
Make sure that everybody knows.

01:40.201 --> 01:41.635
- Well, restrictions on
our software system

01:41.669 --> 01:43.471
have officially been lifted
by the EU since we addressed

01:43.504 --> 01:44.905
their privacy concerns.

01:44.938 --> 01:46.707
- We already have dozens
of governments and five

01:46.740 --> 01:49.277
major software developers
interested in embedding

01:49.310 --> 01:51.512
our app in other programs.
- Excellent.

01:51.545 --> 01:53.281
And Jen was key
at landing those clients.

01:53.314 --> 01:54.282
Thank you.

01:54.315 --> 01:56.250
- Our app is a game-changer.

01:56.284 --> 01:59.253
All of that valuable information
sitting out there in cyberspace

01:59.287 --> 02:00.921
waiting to be discovered,
analyzed,

02:00.954 --> 02:02.656
and, of course, exploited.

02:02.690 --> 02:05.526
And, look, there are concerns
that some are using

02:05.559 --> 02:09.330
our advanced data mining
for targeted propaganda,

02:09.363 --> 02:11.599
but let's remember what we're
selling here is a tool.

02:11.632 --> 02:14.468
- Like a gun or a drug,
it can be misused,

02:14.502 --> 02:16.437
but that's not on us.
- Right.

02:16.470 --> 02:18.672
If everyone knows everything,
and nothing can be hidden,

02:18.706 --> 02:21.375
the truth shall set us free,
and so you're free

02:21.409 --> 02:23.744
till tomorrow.
Bugs to fix.

02:25.613 --> 02:28.649
Something's come up.
- Oh, no, David, no,

02:28.682 --> 02:33.354
David, no.
- Well, I can't wait.

02:33.387 --> 02:35.389
Let's go somewhere private.
- Oh, now you're worried

02:35.423 --> 02:37.658
about privacy?
- I need to be with you tonight.

02:37.691 --> 02:42.330
- I know, and I wanna talk, but
I told my sister I'd meet her.

02:42.363 --> 02:43.964
Maybe we could do dinner after?

02:43.997 --> 02:45.599
- All right, what time
can you meet me?

02:45.633 --> 02:49.270
- I'll be home by 7:00.
Meet you there?

02:49.303 --> 02:52.473
- Don't be late.
I'll track your cell.

02:56.644 --> 03:00.581
[sirens wailing]

03:00.614 --> 03:02.516
- Rollins, is it?

03:02.550 --> 03:04.452
- It looks like it.
Number four.

03:04.485 --> 03:06.454
Same victim profile.
It's the same staging,

03:06.487 --> 03:09.223
same binding, same rope.
- And he took his trophy,

03:09.257 --> 03:10.624
shaved a chunk
from the base of the neck.

03:10.658 --> 03:12.293
- Yeah, head trauma,
no pool of blood.

03:12.326 --> 03:13.594
She wasn't killed here.

03:13.627 --> 03:15.996
- If it follows pattern,
there won't be any DNA.

03:16.029 --> 03:18.632
Let's check security cameras.

03:18.666 --> 03:19.700
Hold everybody back.

03:19.733 --> 03:22.002
- She deserves that much.

03:22.035 --> 03:23.404
Let's go, guys.

03:23.437 --> 03:24.738
- This is our guy,
and he's early.

03:24.772 --> 03:26.640
- Yeah, by over a week.
- He's accelerating,

03:26.674 --> 03:30.478
which means it's only
gonna get worse from here.

03:37.485 --> 03:40.454
[dramatic music]

03:40.488 --> 03:47.495
*

04:23.597 --> 04:26.434
Okay, keep me posted.

04:26.467 --> 04:28.736
- They found her purse near the
body, exactly like the others.

04:28.769 --> 04:30.371
- Yeah, cash was gone,
the rest intact.

04:30.404 --> 04:31.772
- You got a name?
- Jennifer Knowles.

04:31.805 --> 04:33.707
- We got an ID from a company
called "Attention Inc."

04:33.741 --> 04:35.443
- We can run the credit cards
to get a timeline.

04:35.476 --> 04:37.345
- Next of kin?
- Laura Knowles, younger sister.

04:37.378 --> 04:38.712
I notified--she's gonna
meet us at the morgue.

04:38.746 --> 04:40.448
- We're gonna grab the video
footage, canvass

04:40.481 --> 04:42.383
the neighborhood, double down on
the community outreach.

04:42.416 --> 04:43.751
Anything else?
- Yeah, get all of that evidence

04:43.784 --> 04:45.453
to the lab.
Our perp's gotta

04:45.486 --> 04:48.522
screw up sometime.
I need anything, anything

04:48.556 --> 04:50.758
that can give us a lead.
Thank you.

04:50.791 --> 04:53.327
- Detectives, was this
the Second Avenue Strangler?

04:53.361 --> 04:54.728
Another victim?
- No comment.

04:54.762 --> 04:55.796
- Is there anything
you can tell us?

04:55.829 --> 04:57.297
Anything at all?

05:01.869 --> 05:03.604
- That's her.

05:05.373 --> 05:08.542
That's Jen.

05:08.576 --> 05:12.346
Oh, God, I just saw her.
- When?

05:12.380 --> 05:14.448
- Last night.
- Where?

05:14.482 --> 05:17.785
Do you recall a time?
- Maybe 6:00?

05:17.818 --> 05:20.821
We met at a bakery on Second.

05:20.854 --> 05:22.690
What happened?

05:22.723 --> 05:25.459
- Do you know where she was
going when she left you?

05:25.493 --> 05:28.762
- Uh, yeah, to her place
to meet her boyfriend.

05:28.796 --> 05:31.765
- And what's his name?
- David Willard.

05:31.799 --> 05:33.734
He's her boss too.

05:33.767 --> 05:37.037
She told me she was gonna
break up with him.

05:37.070 --> 05:39.873
Oh, God.
- We'll talk to him.

05:42.510 --> 05:46.714
- So we're still investigating,
but we think that the man

05:46.747 --> 05:49.450
who did this is somebody
that we've been tracking.

05:49.483 --> 05:53.487
He's--he's a serial rapist.

05:53.521 --> 05:55.856
- Wait, what?
She was raped?

05:55.889 --> 05:57.825
- I'm afraid so.

05:57.858 --> 06:01.895
- I don't--wait, by the one
who killed those other girls?

06:01.929 --> 06:03.597
- I'm so sorry.

06:03.631 --> 06:04.865
- I don't understand.

06:04.898 --> 06:07.735
I thought he went after
drunks outside bars.

06:07.768 --> 06:09.803
Jen wasn't like that.
- I know, and nobody is saying

06:09.837 --> 06:14.408
that she was, but is it possible
that the two of them maybe

06:14.442 --> 06:17.144
went and got a drink,
or, before they broke up,

06:17.177 --> 06:21.715
maybe she changed her mind?
- No, no, Jen doesn't drink.

06:21.749 --> 06:23.884
- At all?

06:23.917 --> 06:27.455
- Our father was an alcoholic.

06:27.488 --> 06:29.823
So am I, for that matter.

06:29.857 --> 06:32.426
I'm in recovery.
I go to meetings.

06:32.460 --> 06:36.697
But I don't think Jen
ever even tasted alcohol.

06:36.730 --> 06:39.700
- So she wasn't at a bar.
Do you--do you know where

06:39.733 --> 06:42.135
she might have been?
- No, she doesn't like

06:42.169 --> 06:44.438
going out.
- Did you speak to her again

06:44.472 --> 06:46.474
that night after she left you?

06:47.908 --> 06:53.481
- No, she was--she was
supposed to text me.

06:57.818 --> 06:59.720
Can I go?

06:59.753 --> 07:01.555
I need to call my mom.
- Of course, of course.

07:05.626 --> 07:07.895
- Have them get me
her blood alcohol.

07:07.928 --> 07:09.897
- She never drank?
Do you believe that?

07:09.930 --> 07:11.632
- Look, I don't know
what to believe.

07:11.665 --> 07:13.467
Maybe this guy's
changing his pattern.

07:13.501 --> 07:14.968
- Or she was a target
of opportunity.

07:15.002 --> 07:16.904
- It could mean anything.
It could mean nothing.

07:16.937 --> 07:19.907
- Start with the boyfriend?
- Yeah, and take Carisi.

07:22.643 --> 07:24.978
- "Attention," what do they
pay attention to?

07:25.012 --> 07:26.747
- According to their website,
everything.

07:26.780 --> 07:28.516
You know, you do a search for
a flight to Chicago,

07:28.549 --> 07:29.983
you start getting ads
for warm gloves and Cubs hats.

07:30.017 --> 07:31.852
- Oh, these are those bastards?
- Yeah, they data mine

07:31.885 --> 07:33.954
your internet usage, and then
they sell it to advertisers.

07:33.987 --> 07:37.591
"Truth through Transparency"
is their motto.

07:37.625 --> 07:39.893
They want the world to be able
to see everything, no privacy.

07:39.927 --> 07:41.895
- I'd think the police
would like that.

07:41.929 --> 07:44.698
If nothing can be hidden,
there can be no crime.

07:44.732 --> 07:45.899
Am I right?

07:45.933 --> 07:47.768
Detective Rollins from
Loganville, Georgia,

07:47.801 --> 07:49.570
and Detective Carisi,
proud graduate

07:49.603 --> 07:51.705
of Tottenville High,
Prince's Bay, Staten Island.

07:51.739 --> 07:53.541
How can I help you?
- That's great.

07:53.574 --> 07:55.809
You always do background checks
on your guests, Mr. Willard?

07:55.843 --> 07:57.578
- No, I gather information.

07:57.611 --> 07:59.913
It's what I do.
- You're a professional Googler?

07:59.947 --> 08:02.683
- No, I'm a little
better than that.

08:02.716 --> 08:06.520
I collect data.
All data.

08:06.554 --> 08:08.822
Knowledge is power, right?

08:08.856 --> 08:11.191
And my knowledge tells me
I know why you're here.

08:11.224 --> 08:12.660
It's about my app, isn't it?

08:12.693 --> 08:14.595
- Why would you think that?

08:14.628 --> 08:16.664
- Look, I've been visited by
Brooklyn and Bronx detectives

08:16.697 --> 08:17.931
already this past month.

08:17.965 --> 08:19.667
I'm gonna tell you
what I told them.

08:19.700 --> 08:21.869
If some degenerate wants to use
my app to stalk women,

08:21.902 --> 08:23.604
that's on him, not me.
- Guys use your app

08:23.637 --> 08:25.205
to stalk women?
- That's not what

08:25.238 --> 08:26.974
it was designed for.
Look, the app isn't the problem.

08:27.007 --> 08:29.309
It's the solution.
- But that's not why we're here.

08:29.342 --> 08:31.044
- We're here about
Jennifer Knowles.

08:31.078 --> 08:33.013
She's your employee.
- Yes.

08:33.046 --> 08:35.549
She's not in today.
She might be working from home.

08:35.583 --> 08:36.684
These creative types.

08:36.717 --> 08:38.619
- But you were
with her last night.

08:38.652 --> 08:41.755
- Yes, why?
- Until what time?

08:41.789 --> 08:45.726
- Uh, till 10:00?
I'm sorry, do you want to

08:45.759 --> 08:47.995
tell me why you're here?

08:48.028 --> 08:52.900
- Ms. Knowles was raped
and murdered last night.

08:52.933 --> 08:55.703
- [spluttering]
Jennifer?

08:55.736 --> 08:57.705
That's not possible.
Are you sure it's her?

08:57.738 --> 08:59.006
- Her sister made the ID.
She was found at

08:59.039 --> 09:02.776
a construction site.
- Oh, my God.

09:02.810 --> 09:04.845
Yeah, it's all over the feeds.
What, so you're telling me

09:04.878 --> 09:06.747
that lunatic serial
killer did this?

09:06.780 --> 09:07.815
- Possible.
- You say the last time

09:07.848 --> 09:08.982
you saw her was 10:00 p.m.?

09:09.016 --> 09:10.851
- I don't know, maybe 10:30?

09:10.884 --> 09:14.988
- Well, we understand that
she was breaking up with you.

09:15.022 --> 09:16.957
- Yes, we decided
to call it quits.

09:16.990 --> 09:18.592
What does that have to
do with--

09:18.626 --> 09:19.993
- So it was mutual?
No hard feelings?

09:20.027 --> 09:22.863
- No, oh, is this from Laura?

09:22.896 --> 09:25.733
Look, she's a nice woman,
but she's not exactly

09:25.766 --> 09:27.067
in sync with reality.
She's paranoid.

09:27.100 --> 09:28.669
Especially about men.

09:28.702 --> 09:30.270
It doesn't help that
she drinks too much.

09:30.303 --> 09:32.339
- She said she was in AA.
- Yeah, she was until she slept

09:32.372 --> 09:34.041
with her sponsor and
began a downward spiral.

09:34.074 --> 09:37.010
I'm sorry, this is overwhelming.

09:37.044 --> 09:39.279
- Did you talk to Jennifer
after you left her apartment?

09:39.312 --> 09:44.117
What--what was it, 11:00?
- 10:30, no, I went home.

09:44.151 --> 09:45.886
I didn't call her.
She didn't call me.

09:45.919 --> 09:47.387
- Do you have any idea
why she would've gone out

09:47.420 --> 09:50.290
after you left?
- I don't know, maybe to rescue

09:50.323 --> 09:54.862
her screwed up sister again.
This is why I do what I do.

09:54.895 --> 09:57.097
If everything was transparent,
you'd already know

09:57.130 --> 09:59.132
what happened, wouldn't you?

10:02.903 --> 10:05.372
- No calls or texts between
Jennifer and her sister

10:05.405 --> 10:07.775
or anyone else
after 6:00 last night.

10:07.808 --> 10:10.844
If Jennifer made a date to meet
Laura, she did it via ESP.

10:10.878 --> 10:12.345
- Hey, so the labs came back.

10:12.379 --> 10:14.147
All the other victims
had matching rug fibers.

10:14.181 --> 10:15.783
There were none
found on Jennifer.

10:15.816 --> 10:17.718
- What about her blood alcohol,
cause of death?

10:17.751 --> 10:19.687
- Well, we're waiting for
the ME's report to come back.

10:19.720 --> 10:21.088
- Anything on Jennifer's
social media?

10:21.121 --> 10:22.790
- No, not yet.
She kept it pretty professional,

10:22.823 --> 10:23.891
but we're still looking.

10:23.924 --> 10:25.726
[phone buzzing]

10:25.759 --> 10:26.960
- Benson.

10:29.362 --> 10:31.965
- Ooh, pop up ad.

10:31.999 --> 10:35.669
Were you searching for
brassieres, Carisi?

10:35.703 --> 10:38.706
- No, a friend was
using my computer.

10:38.739 --> 10:40.808
- Your friend's a 34B?

10:40.841 --> 10:43.010
- There's no secrets
anymore, huh?

10:43.043 --> 10:47.114
Every website, every search
you do, they know.

10:47.147 --> 10:48.916
Your friend, she got a name?

10:48.949 --> 10:51.084
- 86 and East End, got it.

10:51.118 --> 10:53.854
- What's going on?
- Ugh, precinct just picked up

10:53.887 --> 10:55.689
a suspect.
They think it's our guy.

10:55.723 --> 10:57.190
- 24 hours and he's
back out there already?

10:57.224 --> 10:59.426
- I don't know.
Let's go.

11:01.128 --> 11:03.897
- Look, I know it was stupid.
He offered me a free ride.

11:03.931 --> 11:05.065
Is he the one?

11:05.098 --> 11:07.167
- She was drunk,
making herself a target.

11:07.200 --> 11:10.070
I was trying to help that girl.

11:10.103 --> 11:12.439
I should've let somebody
rape you, you dumb bitch.

11:12.472 --> 11:13.974
- This our serial?
- Looks like.

11:14.007 --> 11:15.776
- Where'd we get him?

11:15.809 --> 11:18.011
- The vic got into a fight
with her boyfriend at a bar.

11:18.045 --> 11:20.714
She stumbles out drunk,
breaks a heel, gypsy cab driver

11:20.748 --> 11:22.716
offers her a ride.
Lucky for her, she's not

11:22.750 --> 11:25.218
as drunk as he thought.
Recognizes him from the sketch.

11:25.252 --> 11:27.821
Realizes she's in trouble,
that he's got her locked in,

11:27.855 --> 11:29.757
so she texts a picture
to the tip line.

11:29.790 --> 11:31.391
- Good for her.
- Yeah, a precinct cop

11:31.424 --> 11:33.460
pulled them over,
searched the cab.

11:33.493 --> 11:37.731
His whole toolkit's here.
Knife, rope, clippers, condoms.

11:37.765 --> 11:39.800
- Did you get any blood?

11:42.936 --> 11:44.504
- Well, check for fibers,
see if they match

11:44.537 --> 11:47.174
the ones on our vics.
- Looks like we got our guy.

11:47.207 --> 11:49.242
- I want this sewn up.
Get him to the squad.

11:49.276 --> 11:52.045
I want to hear him say
that he did it.

11:58.051 --> 11:59.887
- I was trying
to help that girl.

11:59.920 --> 12:01.421
- Yeah, well, we're checking
your DNA right now, Alex,

12:01.454 --> 12:02.823
and I'm pretty sure
it's gonna match.

12:02.856 --> 12:04.958
- Yeah, DNA, right.
If I were a rapist,

12:04.992 --> 12:06.960
I wouldn't leave any DNA.
- You think?

12:06.994 --> 12:09.897
Hair, saliva, if you sneezed,
we got a match.

12:09.930 --> 12:11.231
- Yeah, we already found
rug fibers that came

12:11.264 --> 12:13.033
from your cab and their blood
in your trunk.

12:13.066 --> 12:14.768
- We don't even need
a confession.

12:14.802 --> 12:18.171
Rape and murder, that's life.

12:18.205 --> 12:20.808
- Well, I only got
one life you can take.

12:20.841 --> 12:22.876
I still win.

12:22.910 --> 12:24.211
I took all theirs.

12:24.244 --> 12:25.946
Stupid whores.

12:25.979 --> 12:27.915
- Come again?

12:27.948 --> 12:31.051
- They know I'm out there,
and they still fall for it.

12:31.084 --> 12:32.820
"Oh, hey, honey,

12:32.853 --> 12:35.823
"are you crazy walking home
alone?

12:35.856 --> 12:38.125
"You know, there are guys
out there that'll snatch you up.

12:38.158 --> 12:39.893
Come on, get in."

12:42.129 --> 12:44.531
The dumb, drunk bitches did.

12:44.564 --> 12:46.967
You ask me, they wanted it.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.537
Like the thrill of getting
some scary strange.

12:50.570 --> 12:52.539
- So you're admitting it.

12:52.572 --> 12:54.808
- You have DNA.

12:57.210 --> 12:59.546
- You kill her?

12:59.579 --> 13:02.582
- This one kissed me first
when I brought her home.

13:02.615 --> 13:04.217
Slut.

13:04.251 --> 13:05.919
- What about her?

13:05.953 --> 13:10.290
- She put up a fight,
nearly took an eye out.

13:10.323 --> 13:13.861
I told you, I did all of them.

13:13.894 --> 13:15.062
What about these two?

13:15.095 --> 13:18.231
- Oh, she was sweet.

13:18.265 --> 13:19.933
She tasted good.

13:21.935 --> 13:23.336
Is that where you got my saliva?

13:23.370 --> 13:26.139
- What about the other one?

13:26.173 --> 13:27.975
- Yeah, sure, her too.
Keep 'em coming.

13:28.008 --> 13:29.877
Did you find the ones
in Boston yet?

13:38.218 --> 13:41.054
- There you go, case closed.
Four homicides that COMPSTAT

13:41.088 --> 13:45.993
will put in our win column.
- Okay, uh, three for sure,

13:46.026 --> 13:48.128
but the fact pattern for
Jennifer doesn't match.

13:48.161 --> 13:49.897
Did you see his reaction to her?

13:49.930 --> 13:52.065
It was like--it was like
that photo was the first time

13:52.099 --> 13:54.167
he ever saw her.
- He--he just confessed.

13:54.201 --> 13:57.270
- Yeah, well, some guys
like to run up their stats.

13:57.304 --> 13:58.972
[knocking]

13:59.006 --> 14:01.141
- Lieutenant, ME report
came back.

14:01.174 --> 14:02.876
Looks like Jennifer's sister
was right.

14:02.910 --> 14:04.277
There was no alcohol
in her blood.

14:04.311 --> 14:06.179
- So?

14:06.213 --> 14:10.017
- Well, so, we also have
semen that

14:10.050 --> 14:12.385
doesn't match our perp's DNA,
and her cause of death was

14:12.419 --> 14:14.387
blunt force trauma to the head,
not asphyxiation.

14:14.421 --> 14:16.223
She was strangled post-mortem.

14:16.256 --> 14:19.359
- So she had sex with somebody
else before he got to her,

14:19.392 --> 14:21.594
and things got rough
before he raped her.

14:21.628 --> 14:22.996
I mean, he got rough
with all his vics.

14:23.030 --> 14:24.998
It happens.
He confessed.

14:25.032 --> 14:28.301
- Right, but it's possible
that we have a copy cat.

14:28.335 --> 14:31.371
- A copy cat who knew our rapist
tied his victim's hands behind

14:31.404 --> 14:34.307
their backs and cut their hair?
Those details weren't released.

14:34.341 --> 14:36.609
- Does it hurt to be sure?

14:36.643 --> 14:39.112
- Look, Lieutenant,
you outrank me,

14:39.146 --> 14:40.647
but you don't make friends
at 1PP

14:40.680 --> 14:42.682
by unsolving homicides.

14:42.715 --> 14:44.351
As far as I'm concerned,
this case is closed.

14:44.384 --> 14:47.320
- As far as I'm concerned...

15:03.270 --> 15:03.436
.

15:03.470 --> 15:04.437
- We did arrest a suspect
in your sister's murder.

15:06.273 --> 15:09.142
- Second Avenue Strangler,
I heard.

15:09.176 --> 15:12.279
It doesn't make sense.
- Why's that?

15:12.312 --> 15:14.314
- Because someone else did it.

15:14.347 --> 15:16.449
You should be talking to her
boyfriend, David Willard.

15:16.483 --> 15:19.152
- We did speak to him,
and he told us that

15:19.186 --> 15:21.421
they broke up amicably,
and then he went home.

15:21.454 --> 15:23.223
- I don't believe it.

15:23.256 --> 15:24.992
- Why?

15:25.025 --> 15:28.728
- Because David is
a controlling, twisted prick,

15:28.761 --> 15:30.297
and he has a temper.

15:30.330 --> 15:32.432
That's why Jen was
breaking up with him.

15:32.465 --> 15:35.335
- Okay, is it possible that
she went out to find you?

15:35.368 --> 15:38.371
- No, why?
- To a bar to help you get home?

15:38.405 --> 15:40.740
- I wouldn't be at a bar.
I'm in AA.

15:40.773 --> 15:43.176
- Still?

15:43.210 --> 15:44.444
- What's that mean?

15:44.477 --> 15:46.179
- We heard you dropped out.

15:46.213 --> 15:47.480
- From who?
I--

15:50.417 --> 15:52.452
David.

15:52.485 --> 15:55.155
That son of a bitch.

15:55.188 --> 15:57.524
He's been spying on me.

15:57.557 --> 15:59.059
You don't get it.

15:59.092 --> 16:01.061
Jen said that he was
spying on her.

16:01.094 --> 16:03.030
He must have spied on me too.

16:03.063 --> 16:04.531
No one knew I left AA.

16:04.564 --> 16:05.532
Not even Jen.

16:05.565 --> 16:07.334
- So how would Willard find out?

16:07.367 --> 16:11.438
- Maybe he hacked my phone.

16:11.471 --> 16:14.174
There's ways to turn it on
and eavesdrop.

16:14.207 --> 16:17.277
I mean, he could be
listening to us right now.

16:17.310 --> 16:19.146
I know what you think.

16:19.179 --> 16:22.115
What David may have told you,
but I'm not crazy.

16:22.149 --> 16:25.385
- Nobody's saying that you are.

16:25.418 --> 16:27.587
- Well, you may not care
if you arrest the wrong guy,

16:27.620 --> 16:31.391
but I do.

16:31.424 --> 16:34.294
Jen was my sister.

16:39.266 --> 16:41.168
- So she thinks Willard
is watching her?

16:41.201 --> 16:42.402
- Willard did say
she was paranoid.

16:42.435 --> 16:43.470
- Women should be paranoid.

16:43.503 --> 16:45.238
It's a survival skill.

16:45.272 --> 16:47.340
- Look, maybe he's casting shade
to cover himself.

16:47.374 --> 16:50.443
- Willard did put himself
with the victim in her apartment

16:50.477 --> 16:51.578
the night she was killed.

16:51.611 --> 16:53.113
- Okay, so anything's possible.

16:53.146 --> 16:54.281
Have we checked her apartment?

16:54.314 --> 16:56.049
- Homicide gave it
the once over.

16:56.083 --> 16:58.118
No sign of struggle.
CSU hasn't touched it.

16:58.151 --> 16:59.786
- So get them over there first
thing in the morning, guys.

16:59.819 --> 17:01.488
We need to be sure.

17:06.093 --> 17:07.794
There's no prints
on a glass coffee table?

17:07.827 --> 17:09.229
- Seriously?
Must've had one hell

17:09.262 --> 17:10.597
of a cleaning lady.

17:10.630 --> 17:15.835
- There is residue of cleanser,
and what looks like

17:15.868 --> 17:18.405
diluted blood in this one crack.
- Blood?

17:18.438 --> 17:21.141
- It's a minute sample.
It could be from anything,

17:21.174 --> 17:23.643
a paper cut three months ago.
- Check it out.

17:23.676 --> 17:28.481
- Jennifer taped over
her camera lens.

17:28.515 --> 17:30.650
- So her sister wasn't
the only one that was paranoid.

17:30.683 --> 17:33.120
- Director of the FBI
and Mark Zuckerberg both

17:33.153 --> 17:34.154
cover up their web cams.

17:34.187 --> 17:35.222
- Get that to Computer Crime.

17:35.255 --> 17:36.556
See if there's spyware on it.

17:36.589 --> 17:38.858
Also take the router and see
what IPA addresses

17:38.891 --> 17:40.260
it was communicating with.

17:40.293 --> 17:42.162
- Okay, I got something.

17:42.195 --> 17:45.432
There's a toolbox under
the sink with what looks like

17:45.465 --> 17:48.435
freshly-cut rope.
That look familiar?

17:48.468 --> 17:50.603
- That looks like the rope
that Jennifer and the other vics

17:50.637 --> 17:52.305
were tied with.
- Yeah, maybe, it looks

17:52.339 --> 17:53.640
the same to me.
- Hold on, Fin,

17:53.673 --> 17:55.342
your rope expert's
on this one, right?

17:55.375 --> 17:56.609
- Bennett, yeah.

17:56.643 --> 17:58.545
- Great, get that to him
immediately and find out

17:58.578 --> 18:02.315
if indeed that was the rope that
Jennifer's hands were tied with.

18:02.349 --> 18:04.251
- Lieutenant, pleasure
to see you again.

18:04.284 --> 18:06.419
Well, considering...
- Yeah, what do we have?

18:06.453 --> 18:09.356
- Okay, the rope that bound
your first three victims

18:09.389 --> 18:12.192
was an Everbilt poly
and poly composite

18:12.225 --> 18:14.327
with a 300-pound
breaking strength

18:14.361 --> 18:17.497
and an 11.1-millimeter diameter.

18:17.530 --> 18:21.568
It was used here,
here, and here.

18:21.601 --> 18:23.336
- But not Jennifer Knowles?

18:23.370 --> 18:27.240
- No, this is the rope that
bound Jennifer Knowles.

18:27.274 --> 18:28.708
- Looks like the other one.

18:28.741 --> 18:31.644
- To the layman, perhaps,
but it's a solid braid

18:31.678 --> 18:34.281
polypropylene product,
similar diameter,

18:34.314 --> 18:36.249
only 200-pound strength.

18:36.283 --> 18:38.285
This is what you found
in her toolbox.

18:38.318 --> 18:40.620
- So it's different than the
rope used on the other victims.

18:40.653 --> 18:42.389
- Absolutely.

18:42.422 --> 18:45.292
She was tied with the rope
from her own apartment.

18:47.460 --> 18:50.163
Is that helpful, Lieutenant?

18:50.197 --> 18:53.666
- Very.

18:53.700 --> 18:56.236
- I already told the other
detectives everything I know.

18:56.269 --> 18:57.937
- I just want to discuss
the night of the murder

18:57.970 --> 18:59.539
one more time.
- Yeah, I understand that,

18:59.572 --> 19:01.374
but we could've done that
in my office.

19:01.408 --> 19:03.543
Bringing me down
to your scary interrogation room

19:03.576 --> 19:05.712
isn't gonna somehow
jog my memory.

19:05.745 --> 19:08.147
- You can have a seat
in that chair.

19:11.684 --> 19:14.687
- So we know that you two
were together

19:14.721 --> 19:16.623
the night of the murder.

19:16.656 --> 19:20.527
We know that the two of you
broke up in Jennifer's apartment

19:20.560 --> 19:22.562
around 10:30.
Is that correct?

19:22.595 --> 19:25.232
- Yes, I've already discussed
this with the other cops.

19:25.265 --> 19:27.567
- Why'd you split up?

19:27.600 --> 19:30.937
- Jennifer and I--
our relationship was

19:30.970 --> 19:32.605
very passionate,
but, at the end of the day,

19:32.639 --> 19:35.675
it was unsustainable.
- Unsustainable how?

19:35.708 --> 19:37.277
- It was one-dimensional.

19:37.310 --> 19:38.411
We were only good at one thing.

19:38.445 --> 19:39.646
- Which was?

19:39.679 --> 19:43.216
- Sex, but we liked
each other a lot,

19:43.250 --> 19:44.951
so we decided,
"let's call it quits."

19:44.984 --> 19:46.953
We didn't wanna jeopardize
our work relationship

19:46.986 --> 19:48.521
or our friendship,
for that matter.

19:48.555 --> 19:50.557
- You having sex before
or after you split up?

19:50.590 --> 19:53.360
- Before.

19:53.393 --> 19:55.262
It was beautiful.

19:55.295 --> 19:58.398
- Was there any arguing?
Any fighting?

19:58.431 --> 20:01.368
- No, it was a mutual decision.
- Mutual?

20:01.401 --> 20:04.471
Because Laura Knowles said that
it was Jennifer's choice,

20:04.504 --> 20:06.706
that she wanted to
break up with you.

20:06.739 --> 20:09.409
- Laura Knowles says that
my Golden Retriever

20:09.442 --> 20:11.244
is a Russian spy,
but, between us, I wouldn't

20:11.278 --> 20:14.981
take that to the bank.
- Well, between us, being glib

20:15.014 --> 20:19.252
isn't gonna make this go away
or us, for that matter.

20:22.455 --> 20:25.392
Did you look under Jennifer's
kitchen sink that night?

20:25.425 --> 20:26.693
- I'm sorry, "under her sink"?

20:26.726 --> 20:28.461
Is that some kind
of a sexual metaphor?

20:28.495 --> 20:32.599
- No, we found your fingerprints
on the handle of the cabinet

20:32.632 --> 20:35.302
underneath the kitchen sink.

20:35.335 --> 20:37.670
- I-I have no idea
what you're talking about.

20:37.704 --> 20:40.340
- I'm sorry...

20:40.373 --> 20:44.477
I'm obviously
not speaking clearly enough,

20:44.511 --> 20:47.714
so my bad.

20:47.747 --> 20:50.717
I'm talking about
you killing Jennifer.

20:50.750 --> 20:54.654
I'm talking about you hacking
into the NYPD so you could

20:54.687 --> 20:57.324
impersonate
the pattern 23 rapist.

20:57.357 --> 21:01.628
I'm talking about you finding
rope underneath the cabinet,

21:01.661 --> 21:04.631
tying her hands,
and then dumping her body

21:04.664 --> 21:06.666
at some construction site.

21:08.668 --> 21:12.339
Is that better?
Is that more clear?

21:12.372 --> 21:14.374
- Wow, you have
a vivid imagination.

21:14.407 --> 21:16.576
It's impressive, no?

21:18.545 --> 21:20.713
But the truth is I'm far
too smart to do

21:20.747 --> 21:23.550
something that stupid.
- Or far too stupid

21:23.583 --> 21:25.552
to do something that smart.

21:26.919 --> 21:28.655
- I'm done talking.
I want a lawyer.

21:28.688 --> 21:32.392
- Oh, you're free to go.

21:32.425 --> 21:36.663
But, like I said,
this isn't going away.

21:36.696 --> 21:37.897
And neither are we.

21:42.402 --> 21:43.903
- Wait a minute,
they're about to build a statue

21:43.936 --> 21:45.638
in your honor at 1PP
for catching

21:45.672 --> 21:49.409
the serial killer/rapist
that had the whole city on edge.

21:49.442 --> 21:50.843
Now you're telling me
this guy didn't do it?

21:50.877 --> 21:55.482
- He didn't do one.
- Right, because why?

21:55.515 --> 21:58.818
Because her boyfriend had sex
with her before she was killed?

21:58.851 --> 22:02.789
- Her controlling,
emotionally abusive boyfriend

22:02.822 --> 22:04.591
whom she broke up with
that night.

22:04.624 --> 22:06.693
- So he killed her in her
apartment and transported her

22:06.726 --> 22:08.461
to the construction site--
- Four blocks away.

22:08.495 --> 22:10.096
Completely do-able.
- And then what?

22:10.129 --> 22:12.432
And then he left her there with
her hands tied with a rope,

22:12.465 --> 22:14.834
hair shorn, using the exact M.O.
as the Second Avenue Strangler?

22:14.867 --> 22:18.671
No, that information
was private.

22:18.705 --> 22:20.840
Willard could not know
those details.

22:20.873 --> 22:25.845
- Unless--unless he hacked into
NYPD's computer system.

22:25.878 --> 22:28.147
He's a technical genius.

22:28.180 --> 22:30.850
If anyone could do it, he could.

22:30.883 --> 22:33.420
- Okay, so, in your scenario,
Willard,

22:33.453 --> 22:35.455
with his dead girlfriend
in the room, hacked the NYPD,

22:35.488 --> 22:36.923
and then tied her with a rope.

22:36.956 --> 22:41.694
- A rope that the Second Avenue
Strangler never used before.

22:41.728 --> 22:45.432
A rope that Willard found
in Jennifer's apartment.

22:45.465 --> 22:47.434
- Which is your only actual
piece of real evidence.

22:47.467 --> 22:50.637
- Which is a damn good
piece of evidence.

22:50.670 --> 22:53.740
- True.
- If the rope matches...

22:53.773 --> 22:55.808
- The crusading
Lieutenant Benson get her man.

22:55.842 --> 22:57.510
[phone buzzing]

22:57.544 --> 23:02.415
And upsets a very large
apple cart in the process.

23:03.816 --> 23:05.452
What is it?

23:07.954 --> 23:10.890
What?

23:10.923 --> 23:12.625
- It's rather simple
and embarrassing.

23:12.659 --> 23:14.527
I made an error.

23:14.561 --> 23:16.863
This is the rope that was found
in Jennifer Knowles' apartment.

23:16.896 --> 23:19.165
This is the rope
that tied her hands.

23:19.198 --> 23:20.166
Two different ropes.

23:20.199 --> 23:21.768
- How did this happen?

23:21.801 --> 23:24.604
- A misunderstanding.
The lab assistant thought

23:24.637 --> 23:25.972
I asked for a rope
from the apartment.

23:26.005 --> 23:27.907
I wanted the rope
from the crime scene.

23:27.940 --> 23:30.577
He brought me a second sample
from the apartment.

23:30.610 --> 23:33.646
- So Dr. Bennett, just to be
clear, you're saying that

23:33.680 --> 23:36.716
the rope used to tie
Jennifer Knowles' hands matches

23:36.749 --> 23:38.785
all the other victims,
but not the rope

23:38.818 --> 23:40.553
that we found in her apartment?

23:40.587 --> 23:44.924
- Yes, that's--
that's where it stands.

23:44.957 --> 23:47.860
Now, if you don't mind,
I have to make sure

23:47.894 --> 23:51.864
nothing else is misfiled.

23:51.898 --> 23:53.800
- [scoffs]

23:53.833 --> 23:55.001
Are you buying this?

23:55.034 --> 23:57.537
- I don't know.
This guy is solid.

23:57.570 --> 23:58.905
He hasn't made
a mistake in 20 years.

23:58.938 --> 24:01.040
- Exactly.
- So why lie now?

24:01.073 --> 24:03.476
Why protect Willard?

24:03.510 --> 24:06.579
- Maybe this is Willard
protecting himself.

24:06.613 --> 24:09.849
Look, Laura thinks
that he hacked her.

24:09.882 --> 24:11.551
We think that
he hacked the NYPD.

24:11.584 --> 24:12.719
That's how he got the M.O.

24:12.752 --> 24:15.788
Maybe--maybe he hacked
Bennett as well.

24:15.822 --> 24:19.058
- And found what?
- Who the hell knows, but...

24:26.165 --> 24:26.699
.

24:26.733 --> 24:27.700
- Okay, computer crimes
ran a deep systems check.

24:29.636 --> 24:31.671
Somebody did hack Laura
and Jennifer Knowles'

24:31.704 --> 24:33.706
email accounts.
- So Laura isn't paranoid.

24:33.740 --> 24:35.942
- And they said
it looks like the same intruder

24:35.975 --> 24:38.611
hacked the NYPD.
- So he could've learned

24:38.645 --> 24:41.047
the Strangler's M.O.
- Exactly, and Colin Bennett's

24:41.080 --> 24:43.716
email accounts,
personal and work.

24:43.750 --> 24:45.818
- And if they dug up dirt
on a rope expert...

24:45.852 --> 24:47.987
- I mean, what kind of dirt?
This guy's into ropes,

24:48.020 --> 24:50.690
tides, paints, and solvent.
- Okay, so the hacker had to be

24:50.723 --> 24:52.625
Willard, right?
- Yeah, of course it was, but

24:52.659 --> 24:54.727
Computer Crimes can't prove it.
He covered his tracks.

24:54.761 --> 24:56.596
- And if it was Willard,

24:56.629 --> 24:58.197
and he dug up
something on Dr. Bennett,

24:58.230 --> 25:00.967
then it explains why
he suddenly changed his story

25:01.000 --> 25:04.103
with that lame excuse
about mixed up samples.

25:04.136 --> 25:06.673
- So what now?
- So we go back to Dr. Bennett

25:06.706 --> 25:10.176
for a longer conversation.
- Uh, yeah, about that,

25:10.209 --> 25:12.845
he's not returning calls.
He left his office at lunch,

25:12.879 --> 25:14.080
and he hasn't come back.

25:14.113 --> 25:16.816
- Track his phone.
Find him.

25:19.719 --> 25:21.754
- My phone.

25:21.788 --> 25:24.156
I should've thrown it
in the river.

25:24.190 --> 25:26.893
I kept thinking about people
I might want

25:26.926 --> 25:28.761
to send a final message.

25:28.795 --> 25:32.665
- You don't need to do that,
Dr. Bennett.

25:32.699 --> 25:37.003
You don't need that gun either.
- No?

25:37.036 --> 25:39.005
My work was my life.

25:39.038 --> 25:41.941
And now I-I can't go back, ever.

25:41.974 --> 25:44.711
- You can't,
but you can help us.

25:44.744 --> 25:46.746
Tell us what happened.
- You know what happened.

25:46.779 --> 25:49.682
- But we need you to tell us.
There's a young woman dead.

25:49.716 --> 25:51.851
Her killer's free.
Catching killers is your job.

25:51.884 --> 25:53.820
- Well, it was my job, yes.

25:53.853 --> 25:55.254
I did some good there
for a while, didn't I?

25:55.287 --> 25:57.056
- You did a lot.

25:57.089 --> 25:59.158
- You see I thought I could
make up for my one mistake

25:59.191 --> 26:04.864
through my work, but...
when everyone knows everything,

26:04.897 --> 26:06.833
how can one ever really
forgive and forget?

26:06.866 --> 26:08.100
- How'd he contact you?

26:08.134 --> 26:09.869
- I got a call.

26:09.902 --> 26:11.804
There was no name.
It was untraceable.

26:11.838 --> 26:13.005
I'm sure it was a burner cell.

26:13.039 --> 26:14.774
- What'd the caller say?

26:14.807 --> 26:18.144
- Change my report.
Say the ropes don't match.

26:18.177 --> 26:21.147
In case anyone checked,
get rid of the rope.

26:21.180 --> 26:24.851
- And if you didn't
do what they asked?

26:24.884 --> 26:28.154
- Shame, a lot of it.

26:28.187 --> 26:32.224
It was something embarrassing...

26:33.960 --> 26:36.228
And wrong.

26:36.262 --> 26:37.897
Something very wrong.

26:37.930 --> 26:39.799
- Okay, Doc, Doc,
you're raising that gun

26:39.832 --> 26:43.069
to hand it to me, right?

26:43.102 --> 26:44.871
- I don't know.

26:44.904 --> 26:47.239
- Give it to me, Doc, come on.

26:50.943 --> 26:52.311
Give me the gun.

27:01.353 --> 27:03.122
- It doesn't matter
what he does now.

27:03.155 --> 27:05.224
He could bring the rope into
court in a golden chariot.

27:05.257 --> 27:06.993
His credibility is shot.

27:07.026 --> 27:08.928
The evidence is tainted.
Chain of custody's broken.

27:08.961 --> 27:11.230
- So Willard blackmails his way
out of trouble and that's that?

27:11.263 --> 27:13.065
- Do you have
anything else on him?

27:13.099 --> 27:16.068
- Nothing, less than nothing
because someone else confessed.

27:16.102 --> 27:17.837
- Well, you need to
get something.

27:17.870 --> 27:19.706
I'll get you warrants.
- Yes, for his computers,

27:19.739 --> 27:21.841
his car, his apartment.
We need to move fast

27:21.874 --> 27:23.843
because this guy's gonna be
covering his tracks.

27:23.876 --> 27:25.978
- Go to his office, I'll get you
a warrant and email it to you

27:26.012 --> 27:26.979
by the time you get there.

27:27.013 --> 27:29.015
[phone buzzes]

27:31.984 --> 27:33.119
Hello?

27:33.152 --> 27:34.754
Who's this?

27:38.324 --> 27:39.859
What about her?

27:45.031 --> 27:46.332
- Hands off the keyboards.

27:46.365 --> 27:48.134
- Tell your employees
not to touch a thing.

27:48.167 --> 27:50.036
- This is private property,
unless you have a warrant,

27:50.069 --> 27:52.138
which I don't see.
- It's on its way.

27:52.171 --> 27:53.940
Nobody touch a thing
until I say so.

27:53.973 --> 27:55.742
- You can't just tell me
to stop my business.

27:55.775 --> 27:58.377
[phone buzzes]
- Barba, we all set?

27:58.410 --> 28:02.782
What?
Why?

28:05.317 --> 28:08.054
- What?
What's going on?

28:08.087 --> 28:09.288
- Barba just said he's
off the case,

28:09.321 --> 28:11.290
and he has to recuse himself.

28:11.323 --> 28:14.293
- Why?
- I don't know.

28:14.326 --> 28:16.128
- Let me guess,
somebody finally realized

28:16.162 --> 28:17.997
this whole investigation
makes no sense

28:36.849 --> 28:37.149
.

28:37.183 --> 28:38.084
- Barba, what do you mean,
you're off the case?

28:40.186 --> 28:41.520
What happened?
- There was nothing I could do.

28:41.553 --> 28:43.289
I had to recuse myself.
- Why?

28:43.322 --> 28:45.157
- I can't tell you.
I'm sorry.

28:45.191 --> 28:46.959
- You can't tell me?
- Yeah, you've gotta trust me.

28:46.993 --> 28:48.327
This is for the best.
- Oh, so I should trust you,

28:48.360 --> 28:50.196
but you don't trust me?
How does that work?

28:50.229 --> 28:52.031
- You're making this personal.
It's not personal.

28:52.064 --> 28:53.432
- It is personal now!

28:53.465 --> 28:55.134
Would you stop?
Just talk to me.

28:55.167 --> 28:57.303
What happened?

29:00.039 --> 29:02.508
I have a viable suspect
for a brutal murder.

29:02.541 --> 29:04.811
I need those warrants.
- You see that building

29:04.844 --> 29:06.979
over there?
There's a whole floor

29:07.013 --> 29:09.415
full of ADAs.
Ask one of them.

29:09.448 --> 29:12.284
Right now, it's the best
that I can do.

29:14.553 --> 29:16.155
- My girlfriend
was just murdered.

29:16.188 --> 29:17.790
This is outrageous.
- You mean overdue.

29:17.824 --> 29:19.525
- No, I mean outrageous.
You're not supposed to be here.

29:19.558 --> 29:21.193
- Why?
Because you didn't see it

29:21.227 --> 29:22.528
on email or because it's
an old-fashioned,

29:22.561 --> 29:24.496
hand-written warrant?
- Officers are searching

29:24.530 --> 29:26.398
your apartment
and car right now.

29:26.432 --> 29:28.500
- Hands off your computers.
- You're wasting your time.

29:28.534 --> 29:31.470
- Okay, we will need access
to all of your hardware

29:31.503 --> 29:33.572
and the servers
that they're linked to.

29:33.605 --> 29:37.009
NYPD will be transporting them,
and they'll be returned to you

29:37.043 --> 29:39.411
when our search
of its contents is complete.

29:39.445 --> 29:41.180
- That's quite the speech.
Did you rehearse that

29:41.213 --> 29:42.448
on the way over here?
Where'd you get

29:42.481 --> 29:44.150
this warrant anyway?
Your friend Barba?

29:44.183 --> 29:45.151
I thought he was smarter
than that.

29:45.184 --> 29:46.452
Oh, well.

29:51.323 --> 29:54.460
- You need to step aside.
Now.

29:59.231 --> 30:02.068
- Okay, TARU's got
a thousand mega-terabytes

30:02.101 --> 30:03.569
or whatever to go through.

30:03.602 --> 30:07.306
- CSU says nothing in Willard's
car matches anything found

30:07.339 --> 30:09.441
on any of the victims,
including Jennifer.

30:09.475 --> 30:12.578
- Well, we know from Jennifer's
apartment that this guy knows

30:12.611 --> 30:14.446
how to clean up his messes.

30:14.480 --> 30:17.483
- Liv, listen, when Willard said
to you "your friend Barba..."

30:17.516 --> 30:19.285
- He said that?
- Yeah, how does he know that

30:19.318 --> 30:21.153
you and Barba are friends?

30:21.187 --> 30:22.521
- You guys, we have to assume
that he's been

30:22.554 --> 30:24.090
reading our emails.

30:24.123 --> 30:25.324
- We know he hacked
Bennett, okay?

30:25.357 --> 30:27.293
Then he blackmailed him.

30:27.326 --> 30:28.594
So if he's hacking Barba--
- You think he's blackmailing

30:28.627 --> 30:30.462
Barba too.
- Barba was getting us

30:30.496 --> 30:33.099
a warrant, then all
of a sudden he didn't?

30:34.901 --> 30:36.468
I'm open for another
explanation,

30:36.502 --> 30:38.604
but it makes sense to me.
What do you think, Liv?

30:38.637 --> 30:40.606
- I don't know.
I think...

30:40.639 --> 30:41.607
We need more information.

30:41.640 --> 30:43.375
- Like this?

30:43.409 --> 30:45.344
A uni found a burner cell
in the garbage outside

30:45.377 --> 30:49.115
of Willard's apartment.
Here's the outgoing call list.

30:49.148 --> 30:51.317
Okay, you got one call
to Bennett's office.

30:51.350 --> 30:53.085
- We knew that.
- And then one call

30:53.119 --> 30:54.186
to Barba's office.

30:54.220 --> 30:56.188
- Told you it made sense.

30:57.489 --> 30:59.291
- Who else did he call?

30:59.325 --> 31:01.460
- There's a bunch of calls
to a number in the Bronx.

31:01.493 --> 31:03.629
Ashtonja Abreu.

31:03.662 --> 31:05.264
- Who's that?

31:09.301 --> 31:11.503
[knocking]

31:11.537 --> 31:13.205
- Ashtawnja Abreu?

31:13.239 --> 31:15.441
- It's Ash-tone-juh,
and I already talked to

31:15.474 --> 31:18.577
that other detective.
- Okay, Ashtawnja.

31:18.610 --> 31:22.314
What other detective?
- The one looking into that DA.

31:22.348 --> 31:24.616
No matter what he thinks,
I didn't do nothing.

31:24.650 --> 31:26.485
I'm keeping my life straight.
I'm not like my mom.

31:26.518 --> 31:28.120
- Nobody's saying
that you are.

31:28.154 --> 31:29.621
- That other detective
was saying it,

31:29.655 --> 31:31.257
that the money was for sex,
but I'm not like that.

31:31.290 --> 31:32.391
- Okay, well,
let's slow down here.

31:32.424 --> 31:36.662
What--What money?
And what DA?

31:36.695 --> 31:38.564
- I'm not supposed
to tell anyone.

31:38.597 --> 31:41.934
- Okay, I'm sure that he told
you that, but it's okay.

31:41.968 --> 31:44.536
You can tell us.

31:44.570 --> 31:46.372
- It's some corruption thing.

31:46.405 --> 31:47.974
That detective said
there was a cover up.

31:48.007 --> 31:49.275
- A cover up?

31:49.308 --> 31:52.144
Okay, you need
to tell us exactly

31:52.178 --> 31:53.412
what the other detective
told you.

31:53.445 --> 31:54.546
- Why?
- Because he wasn't

31:54.580 --> 31:59.485
a real detective,
and we are.

31:59.518 --> 32:03.990
- And, Ashtonja, if you don't
wanna get into trouble,

32:04.023 --> 32:06.458
start talking.

32:11.663 --> 32:15.267
You need to speak.
Now.

32:15.301 --> 32:17.236
- About?
- About what you did.

32:17.269 --> 32:20.606
How Willard got to you.
Ashtonja Abreu.

32:20.639 --> 32:22.308
- You talked to her?
- Yeah, and Willard

32:22.341 --> 32:23.709
talked to her too.
He seems to think that

32:23.742 --> 32:25.577
you're paying her for sex.
- I know.

32:25.611 --> 32:27.413
He told me.
- He told you?

32:27.446 --> 32:29.982
Right before you called off
getting me those warrants?

32:30.016 --> 32:32.618
- Yes, come here.

32:34.653 --> 32:35.721
- [sighs]

32:40.592 --> 32:42.028
- Of course,
Willard got it wrong.

32:42.061 --> 32:44.330
I knew Ashtonja's mother,
Marianna.

32:44.363 --> 32:46.598
She was a heroin addict.

32:46.632 --> 32:49.701
And she was a witness in a case

32:49.735 --> 32:53.605
against a guy who raped
and killed two women.

32:53.639 --> 32:55.274
She was the only witness.

32:59.345 --> 33:01.280
On the day of the trial,
she showed up so strung out

33:01.313 --> 33:03.582
she could barely talk.

33:03.615 --> 33:07.753
The judge wouldn't
give me a recess.

33:07.786 --> 33:10.422
Marianna asked for a loan.

33:10.456 --> 33:13.792
- And you gave it to her.
- Yes.

33:13.825 --> 33:17.263
- Knowing that she would
buy heroin.

33:17.296 --> 33:19.498
- Yes.

33:19.531 --> 33:20.766
- And?

33:23.535 --> 33:26.238
- She bought what she bought
and she did what she did,

33:26.272 --> 33:28.674
and she got on the stand.
She buried the guy.

33:32.078 --> 33:37.383
She sent a really bad man to
prison for the rest of his life,

33:37.416 --> 33:42.654
and she died of an overdose,
eight hours later,

33:42.688 --> 33:45.657
leaving behind
her ten-year-old daughter.

33:45.691 --> 33:48.660
- Who you've been giving
money to ever since.

33:48.694 --> 33:50.662
- She lives
with her grandmother.

33:50.696 --> 33:52.098
They're broke.
I help out.

33:52.131 --> 33:53.765
Willard must have
hacked my bank account,

33:53.799 --> 33:56.835
tracked down Ashtonja.
- Why didn't you tell me this?

33:56.868 --> 33:58.637
- I didn't wanna
compromise your case.

33:58.670 --> 34:00.339
You might've been accused
of having a vendetta

34:00.372 --> 34:01.707
against Willard.
- I can still

34:01.740 --> 34:03.675
be accused of that.
- I also wanted to talk to

34:03.709 --> 34:05.811
Ashtonja first.
If this--if this goes public,

34:05.844 --> 34:07.746
she's right in the middle.

34:11.717 --> 34:14.820
- How bad is this
gonna be for you?

34:14.853 --> 34:16.622
- Uh, it depends on
the district attorney.

34:16.655 --> 34:18.457
I told him everything.

34:20.592 --> 34:23.061
We might've seen
our last case together.

34:30.736 --> 34:34.606
- Is there anything
that I can do?

34:37.476 --> 34:39.545
- What you always do.

34:49.121 --> 34:49.288
.

34:49.321 --> 34:50.422
- So Willard blackmailed Bennett
to lose the rope evidence,

34:51.657 --> 34:52.624
and then he blackmailed

34:52.658 --> 34:54.160
Barba to drop the case?

34:54.193 --> 34:55.561
- Yes, except nobody's
dropping the case.

34:55.594 --> 34:56.762
- Well, we did lose
the rope evidence.

34:56.795 --> 34:58.264
- Yeah, so, what else
do we have?

34:58.297 --> 34:59.565
- Not much, Willard's
too smart to leave

34:59.598 --> 35:01.133
any traces of blackmail.

35:01.167 --> 35:02.734
- Terrific.
- But we did find that Willard's

35:02.768 --> 35:04.670
more of a perv than
we originally thought.

35:04.703 --> 35:06.805
He was using his laptop camera
to record him and Jennifer's,

35:06.838 --> 35:08.707
uh, extracurriculars.

35:11.777 --> 35:12.744
- Hey, baby, get in here.

35:12.778 --> 35:15.781
The, uh, situation
is escalating.

35:15.814 --> 35:17.783
Get in here.
- Okay, I get the idea.

35:17.816 --> 35:20.619
So he did this for what?

35:20.652 --> 35:24.156
For blackmail, for revenge porn?

35:24.190 --> 35:25.757
- Maybe just for
his lonely nights.

35:25.791 --> 35:28.160
- That may be, but Jennifer was
definitely not in on the game.

35:28.194 --> 35:29.661
Look at this.

35:31.397 --> 35:32.898
- David, is this thing on?

35:32.931 --> 35:34.566
- What, what are you talking
about?

35:34.600 --> 35:36.668
- You son of a bitch.
- No, d-don't!

35:38.370 --> 35:41.573
- Confirms Jennifer's sister
one more time.

35:41.607 --> 35:44.743
She said Jennifer told her that
Willard was spying on her.

35:44.776 --> 35:46.778
- So the flaky sister
is the most reliable witness

35:46.812 --> 35:49.181
in this whole case?

35:49.215 --> 35:50.349
- Let's go.

35:53.719 --> 35:56.422
- What?

35:56.455 --> 35:58.724
My sister was raped
and murdered.

35:58.757 --> 36:00.192
I'm not allowed to have a drink?

36:00.226 --> 36:01.627
- Well, maybe it's
not the best time.

36:01.660 --> 36:04.196
- There is no best time.

36:04.230 --> 36:06.332
Willard killed her, and you
still haven't arrested him.

36:06.365 --> 36:07.866
What are you people even doing?

36:07.899 --> 36:10.369
- We're working on it.
- You were right.

36:10.402 --> 36:12.338
He was spying on her,
recording her.

36:12.371 --> 36:14.606
- Why didn't you
believe me before?

36:14.640 --> 36:17.743
Because he told you
I'm an alcoholic?

36:17.776 --> 36:21.347
I have eyes.
I have ears.

36:21.380 --> 36:26.218
- We know that, Laura.
We know that.

36:26.252 --> 36:28.220
- He killed her.

36:30.289 --> 36:32.691
She said she had it covered.

36:32.724 --> 36:35.961
She kept telling me that.

36:35.994 --> 36:37.863
She didn't.

36:37.896 --> 36:39.898
- What did she mean,
"she had it covered"?

36:39.931 --> 36:42.368
- In case he tried to fire her
for dumping him.

36:42.401 --> 36:44.903
She said she'd be fine.

36:44.936 --> 36:47.806
That she'd covered her bases.

36:53.412 --> 36:55.247
- She had it covered?
How?

36:55.281 --> 36:57.383
- Willard had video of Jen.

36:57.416 --> 36:58.784
Maybe she did the same?

36:58.817 --> 37:00.852
- In case the break up
got out of hand.

37:00.886 --> 37:04.323
- Let's get TARU and go
back to her apartment.

37:04.356 --> 37:06.425
- Camera on her computer
was taped over.

37:06.458 --> 37:07.993
What else is there?
- Well, Laura thought that

37:08.026 --> 37:10.496
Willard rigged her phone
so he could eavesdrop.

37:10.529 --> 37:12.398
- We checked the victim's cell.
There's nothing there.

37:12.431 --> 37:14.400
- We're surrounded by things
that are always listening.

37:14.433 --> 37:16.034
A friend and I were talking
about going to see a show.

37:16.067 --> 37:17.836
Next thing I know,
I start getting pop-up ads

37:17.869 --> 37:19.971
for Broadway musicals.
Now, we never searched that.

37:20.005 --> 37:22.974
We just talked about it.
- Your friend Ms. 34B?

37:23.008 --> 37:25.377
- All I'm saying is that
things are always listening.

37:25.411 --> 37:27.946
Hey, Siri, what's
the temperature?

37:27.979 --> 37:30.349
- It's currently
45 degrees in New York.

37:30.382 --> 37:33.051
- So what are we looking for?
A talking toaster?

37:33.084 --> 37:35.721
- Detectives, I may
have found something.

37:38.324 --> 37:39.725
TV, on.

37:40.759 --> 37:41.960
- Okay.

37:41.993 --> 37:44.896
- This TV can record video.
- Really?

37:47.065 --> 37:48.434
I don't see a lens.

37:48.467 --> 37:50.702
- It's behind the black boarder.

37:50.736 --> 37:51.770
[beep]

37:51.803 --> 37:53.805
It should save all the videos.

37:56.408 --> 37:58.344
There's a recording from
the night of the murder,

37:58.377 --> 38:01.313
timestamp 9:33 p.m.
Looks like it was set

38:01.347 --> 38:02.848
to be voice activated too.

38:02.881 --> 38:04.516
- Play it.

38:04.550 --> 38:07.453
[beep]

38:07.486 --> 38:09.721
- David, we need to talk.
- Shut up.

38:09.755 --> 38:11.357
"We need to talk..."
- Don't tell me to shut up.

38:11.390 --> 38:12.824
- Just shut up unless
you wanna talk about

38:12.858 --> 38:14.426
how great the sex was,
shut your mouth.

38:14.460 --> 38:15.927
- That's not what
I wanna talk about.

38:15.961 --> 38:17.463
- Okay, what do you
wanna talk about?

38:17.496 --> 38:18.864
How I'm controlling?
- Yes, you are.

38:18.897 --> 38:20.866
- I'm gonna get it right.
- No--

38:20.899 --> 38:22.768
- I'm an arrogant, controlling,
Machiavellian narcissist.

38:22.801 --> 38:23.935
Isn't that what you texted
your idiot sister?

38:23.969 --> 38:26.004
- You read my texts?
What else do you read?

38:26.037 --> 38:27.806
- I read your texts, I read
your emails, I listen

38:27.839 --> 38:29.040
to your phone calls--
- You're sick, you are

38:29.074 --> 38:30.809
a sick man.
- I'm sick?

38:30.842 --> 38:32.010
Well, you're a slut,
so I'm sick--

38:32.043 --> 38:33.512
- Are you--
- [grunts]

38:33.545 --> 38:35.013
[thud]

38:35.046 --> 38:36.882
Get up, we're not done.

38:36.915 --> 38:38.417
Get up!

38:38.450 --> 38:41.753
Such a drama queen, get up.
Come on.

38:41.787 --> 38:44.823
Come on, Jen.

38:44.856 --> 38:46.525
Jen?

38:56.101 --> 38:58.003
- Arrest him, now.

39:04.943 --> 39:06.612
- Not guilty, Your Honor.

39:06.645 --> 39:08.414
This was an accident,
not murder.

39:08.447 --> 39:10.449
- Save it for your trial,
Mr. Willard.

39:10.482 --> 39:11.617
Bail...

39:11.650 --> 39:14.019
- Mr. Willard is
a respected businessman,

39:14.052 --> 39:16.388
tied to the community.
- And charged with murder.

39:16.422 --> 39:18.123
A million dollars,
cash or bond.

39:18.156 --> 39:19.825
Next case.

39:24.563 --> 39:26.898
- Good work, Lieutenant.
Glad I encouraged you

39:26.932 --> 39:29.768
to keep digging.
- You were a real inspiration.

39:33.639 --> 39:36.408
- You believed me.

39:36.442 --> 39:37.909
You got him.

39:37.943 --> 39:40.512
- We got him.

39:40.546 --> 39:42.080
We got him.

39:49.621 --> 39:51.623
- Word is Willard's
attorney's already scrambling

39:51.657 --> 39:53.158
to make a deal.
- Look, unless he pleads

39:53.191 --> 39:55.126
to murder, I say try the case.

39:55.160 --> 39:59.531
- Me too, but I have no input.
I'm off the case.

39:59.565 --> 40:03.101
- I'm so sorry about
all of this, Rafael.

40:03.134 --> 40:07.506
- What I did was wrong, but
the truth is I'd do it again.

40:07.539 --> 40:09.941
Not everything done
in the dark is shameful.

40:12.644 --> 40:14.880
- So now what?

40:14.913 --> 40:16.582
- I have a meeting
with the DA in five minutes.

40:16.615 --> 40:19.951
He'll tell me what happens next.

40:19.985 --> 40:23.622
You know, I love this job.

40:23.655 --> 40:26.124
Oh, I really do,
but sometimes...

40:26.157 --> 40:29.628
- Oh, I know.
