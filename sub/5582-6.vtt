00:05.606 --> 00:07.375
*

00:09.377 --> 00:13.147
*

00:19.320 --> 00:21.089
Look out, New Orleans.

00:21.122 --> 00:22.423
Here's the NCIS crew.

00:22.456 --> 00:23.557
Come on now.

00:23.591 --> 00:25.159
Tell me how good I look.

00:25.193 --> 00:27.295
Oh, my gosh, okay,
I had my doubts,

00:27.328 --> 00:29.697
but I have to admit, you're
looking pretty hot, Lasalle.

00:29.730 --> 00:31.265
I got to hand it to him.

00:31.299 --> 00:34.568
He definitely knows how to work
what his mama gave him.

00:34.602 --> 00:36.437
Oh! Easy, Percy!

00:36.470 --> 00:38.572
Come on, I'm not
some piece of meat now.

00:38.606 --> 00:40.241
You sure?

00:40.274 --> 00:42.576
In that dress, basically,
you're filet minion.

00:42.610 --> 00:44.445
Oh, what have here?!

00:44.478 --> 00:46.447
Oh!
Oh!
Hey.

00:46.480 --> 00:49.817
Wow. Hope you don't mind me
saying, Dwayne, but your legs--

00:49.850 --> 00:51.419
I'm envious.
Thank you,
Sebastian.

00:51.452 --> 00:52.620
I thought about going
with something

00:52.653 --> 00:54.555
a little bit more risquÃ©,
but then, you know,

00:54.588 --> 00:56.390
you look in the mirror,
see what you're working with,

00:56.424 --> 00:57.658
realize that maybe
not everyone's meant

00:57.691 --> 00:59.427
for haute couture.

00:59.460 --> 01:02.830
My dear, you have
many other admirable attributes.

01:02.863 --> 01:06.234
Hello, Crescent City!

01:08.302 --> 01:12.373
Yes, welcome
to the 2015 Red Dress Run!

01:12.406 --> 01:14.375
Let's hear it.

01:14.408 --> 01:16.410
I want all you people,
you fine people,

01:16.444 --> 01:19.247
to have fun today, I want you
to be safe today.

01:19.280 --> 01:20.548
And also, do not forget

01:20.581 --> 01:23.217
that there is
a mayoral election coming up.

01:23.251 --> 01:25.419
So if you like...

01:25.453 --> 01:30.824
If you like your city officials
with backsides like this...

01:33.161 --> 01:34.495
...then Vote Hamilton!

01:34.528 --> 01:35.863
Yeah!

01:35.896 --> 01:39.733
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
we are off!

01:42.336 --> 01:44.838
Last one to the finish
line buys the drinks.
Oh.

01:44.872 --> 01:48.276
No fair! These spanks are really
restricting my movement.

01:52.446 --> 01:54.882
*

01:58.386 --> 02:00.388
*

02:00.421 --> 02:02.523
WOMAN:
Help!

02:04.958 --> 02:07.495
He's got a gun!
Help!
Hey!

02:11.832 --> 02:14.202
Somebody, help me!

02:14.235 --> 02:16.370
Oh.

02:22.443 --> 02:24.778
Someone, help me!

02:41.229 --> 02:43.864
Why?

02:43.897 --> 02:46.267
Why are you doing this?!

03:00.848 --> 03:03.451
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

03:03.484 --> 03:06.287
* Bang, bang, bang, bang

03:06.320 --> 03:08.489
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

03:08.522 --> 03:09.723
* How, how, how, how

03:09.757 --> 03:11.925
* Hey, hey

03:18.031 --> 03:19.533
* You gotta come on.

03:20.968 --> 03:23.337
(siren blaring,
crowd chatter)

03:27.841 --> 03:30.544
Victim is Petty Officer
2nd Class Kelsey Weaver.

03:32.480 --> 03:35.015
From her ID, Weaver
was stationed on

03:35.048 --> 03:36.484
the Henry Knox.

03:36.517 --> 03:37.651
Ship docked yesterday.

03:37.685 --> 03:39.587
Must've been on liberty.

03:41.655 --> 03:42.923
Yes, I forgot
my work clothes.

03:42.956 --> 03:44.592
No one's judging.

03:44.625 --> 03:47.761
Just laughing
on the inside.

03:47.795 --> 03:50.030
BRODY: Witnesses say
they saw the Petty Officer

03:50.063 --> 03:51.832
running through
the crowd,

03:51.865 --> 03:54.568
screaming about some man
chasing her with a gun.

03:54.602 --> 03:58.472
Ran into this building,
minute later, jump straight

03:58.506 --> 04:00.308
off the rooftop, DRT.

04:00.341 --> 04:02.510
Witnesses get a look
at the gunman?

04:02.543 --> 04:04.878
Well, that's what's weird.
No one I could find.

04:04.912 --> 04:06.614
That's not the only
thing that's odd.

04:06.647 --> 04:08.015
WADE:
Yeah, core temp

04:08.048 --> 04:10.284
at time of death is 104.

04:10.318 --> 04:12.052
So, she was sick?

04:12.085 --> 04:15.589
Well, that's what you'd think,
but in my initial assessment,

04:15.623 --> 04:17.591
there's no apparent irritation
to the nose

04:17.625 --> 04:18.759
or throat, or

04:18.792 --> 04:20.928
any other obvious sign
of illness.

04:20.961 --> 04:23.431
We'll know more once we
get through the full autopsy.

04:23.464 --> 04:27.801
Ha. That's my line, dear.

04:27.835 --> 04:30.638
All right, get with Percy,
keep looking for witnesses.

04:30.671 --> 04:32.706
Someone had
to have seen the gunman.

04:32.740 --> 04:34.808
No one saw the gunman.

04:34.842 --> 04:37.878
Odder still, got access
to eight different cameras,

04:37.911 --> 04:40.481
none of which
catch a dude with a gun.

04:41.649 --> 04:43.317
No one was
following her.

04:43.351 --> 04:44.552
Correctamundo.

04:44.585 --> 04:46.620
So, what?
She imagined him?

04:46.654 --> 04:47.888
I don't know.
Maybe we're dealing

04:47.921 --> 04:49.590
with some kind
of mental illness.

04:49.623 --> 04:50.991
BRODY:
Or she was high
on something.

04:51.024 --> 04:54.462
Okay, Sonja, you're
with me. Chris,

04:54.495 --> 04:56.664
contact the Knox's
medical officer,

04:56.697 --> 04:58.566
get Weaver's files sent over.

04:58.599 --> 05:01.068
Meanwhile, we'll head
over to the morgue,

05:01.101 --> 05:04.538
be there when Loretta finishes
her autopsy.

05:04.572 --> 05:06.607
Brody?
Mind if I tag along?

05:06.640 --> 05:08.442
I have to talk
to Sebastian about something.

05:08.476 --> 05:10.711
Sure.

05:13.847 --> 05:15.649
More photos?
Same as the others.

05:15.683 --> 05:17.685
Addressed to "The Jackal,"
no return address.

05:17.718 --> 05:18.886
Images of me photoshopped

05:18.919 --> 05:20.654
into pictures
my sister was originally in.

05:20.688 --> 05:22.990
It's freaky.
It's deaky, actually.

05:23.023 --> 05:25.859
I've been, uh, poring over the
original batch that you gave me,

05:25.893 --> 05:28.696
trying to find any indication
of where they were generated.

05:28.729 --> 05:29.897
Nothing?

05:29.930 --> 05:31.699
Not on that front,
but I've realized

05:31.732 --> 05:34.435
that you're not the only
thing that's been added.

05:34.468 --> 05:36.904
This watch, that cup,
all these other things--

05:36.937 --> 05:38.906
all not part of the original.

05:38.939 --> 05:41.642
Is this the weirdest thing
you've ever seen?
Oh, you kidding me?

05:41.675 --> 05:43.711
This isn't even the weirdest
thing I've seen this morning.

05:43.744 --> 05:45.379
Doc Wade's ready.

05:45.413 --> 05:47.848
Knows why Weaver saw a gunman
that wasn't there.

05:47.881 --> 05:49.583
WADE:
One word--

05:49.617 --> 05:51.585
drugs. The tox screen indicated

05:51.619 --> 05:56.056
the petty officer was high on
a potent synthetic hallucinogen.

05:56.089 --> 05:57.591
Flakka. It's manufactured

05:57.625 --> 06:00.894
overseas-- China,
Mexico, Pakistan.

06:00.928 --> 06:03.030
Last year, hit the streets
of the U.S.

06:03.063 --> 06:05.599
Oh, it's scary. It's a
similar high to cocaine,

06:05.633 --> 06:09.036
but the user
becomes anxious, paranoid,

06:09.069 --> 06:11.639
loses touch with reality.

06:11.672 --> 06:13.641
And even a small overdose

06:13.674 --> 06:16.710
can have lethal spikes
in the body temperature.

06:16.744 --> 06:18.746
Delusions?
Absolutely.

06:18.779 --> 06:21.114
From what I've heard, Flakka is
an epidemic centered in Florida.

06:21.148 --> 06:23.651
I didn't realize it was
an issue here in New Orleans.

06:23.684 --> 06:26.153
It wasn't...
until this week.

06:31.659 --> 06:34.628
Jennifer Livingston,

06:34.662 --> 06:36.764
35.

06:38.699 --> 06:41.602
Isley Markland, 24.

06:41.635 --> 06:42.803
And...

06:42.836 --> 06:46.707
Brooks Gostin, just 18.

06:46.740 --> 06:49.677
Now that's more flakka deaths
in a week

06:49.710 --> 06:51.712
than this morgue has seen
in a year.

06:51.745 --> 06:54.081
Meaning...

06:54.114 --> 06:57.017
out of nowhere...

06:57.050 --> 07:00.053
we got an epidemic on our hands.

07:15.836 --> 07:19.006
(loud, overlapping yelling
and shouting)

07:19.039 --> 07:20.541
They call flakka

07:20.574 --> 07:22.576
the "Five Dollar Insanity"
for a good reason.

07:22.610 --> 07:24.645
This dude here-- he thinks

07:24.678 --> 07:27.147
he's the Incredible Hulk.

07:27.180 --> 07:29.182
This lady-- she ran through

07:29.216 --> 07:30.818
the middle of traffic
for 20 minutes,

07:30.851 --> 07:32.219
takes off her clothes,

07:32.252 --> 07:33.521
and then jumps
into a fountain.

07:33.554 --> 07:36.924
Idiots, every one of 'em.

07:36.957 --> 07:39.860
Just got off the phone
with the commander of the Knox.

07:39.893 --> 07:42.095
He's scuttling liberty
for the time being.

07:42.129 --> 07:45.032
Stern to bow search turned up
three ounces of flakka

07:45.065 --> 07:46.534
in two separate packages.

07:46.567 --> 07:47.835
They know who brought it aboard?

07:47.868 --> 07:49.537
They'd like to...

07:49.570 --> 07:51.505
as well as who's dealing
to our sailors.

07:51.539 --> 07:54.908
I've got something
that might help.

07:54.942 --> 07:58.078
That is Petty Officer
Sofia Velez.

07:58.111 --> 07:59.813
Spoke with Weaver's C.O.

07:59.847 --> 08:02.516
She says that Weaver and Velez
were on liberty together.

08:02.550 --> 08:04.785
All right, go, find
out what she knows.

08:07.154 --> 08:09.156
WOMAN:
Weaver was the best.

08:09.189 --> 08:11.592
Funny. She was
from Boston,

08:11.625 --> 08:14.094
so, she was, of course,
in love with Tom Brady.

08:14.127 --> 08:16.096
Had that great accent.

08:16.129 --> 08:17.831
"Pahked my cah
in Hahvad Yahd."

08:17.865 --> 08:19.700
Well, you know
how she said "flakka"

08:19.733 --> 08:21.702
with that charming accent?

08:21.735 --> 08:23.270
Flakka?

08:23.303 --> 08:24.838
What your friend died of.

08:24.872 --> 08:27.040
Any chance
you two picked it up in the city

08:27.074 --> 08:28.308
while you were
on liberty together?

08:28.341 --> 08:30.010
I think you got
the wrong idea.

08:30.043 --> 08:31.979
Really?

08:32.012 --> 08:35.015
You wouldn't mind
taking an urinalysis test.

08:35.048 --> 08:37.618
See, first you hydrate,
then you pee.

08:37.651 --> 08:38.986
You can't make me do that.

08:39.019 --> 08:40.788
Your C.O. can,
and he's our next call.

08:44.858 --> 08:47.160
If they know I used drugs,
Navy kicks me out.

08:47.194 --> 08:49.730
Dishonorable discharge.
I lose everything.

08:49.763 --> 08:52.199
Not our concern.
How about this?

08:52.232 --> 08:54.635
You tell us who
you bought from, and we'll see

08:54.668 --> 08:56.637
what we can't work out
at Captain's Mast.

08:59.006 --> 09:02.643
Okay.

09:02.676 --> 09:04.878
Well, uh, see, what I heard--

09:04.912 --> 09:07.915
not what I did,
but what I heard...

09:07.948 --> 09:09.917
There was this big warehouse
party in the Quarter,

09:09.950 --> 09:13.153
so Weaver... and a friend
decided to go to.

09:13.186 --> 09:14.788
Address. Write it down.

09:14.822 --> 09:16.256
This party you heard about--

09:16.289 --> 09:18.592
anyone selling flakka?

09:18.626 --> 09:20.928
Well, see... I heard...

09:20.961 --> 09:24.598
it was a young guy,
twenties, tall, dreadlocks.

09:24.632 --> 09:26.767
Name?
That's all I heard.

09:26.800 --> 09:28.335
I'll look into the address.

09:28.368 --> 09:30.804
Run the description through
the database. Meanwhile,

09:30.838 --> 09:32.773
you got to turn two.

09:32.806 --> 09:34.007
Hit the head.

09:34.041 --> 09:36.644
Wait. You said
if I helped you out,

09:36.677 --> 09:38.679
you would see what you could do.

09:38.712 --> 09:40.948
Not our concern.
Explain it to your C.O.

09:51.224 --> 09:53.393
WOMAN:
Where is she? I need to know.
She gonna be okay? Tell me!

09:53.426 --> 09:56.764
Sonja!

09:56.797 --> 09:58.666
Clara Clara?!

09:58.699 --> 10:01.769
Sonja?

10:01.802 --> 10:03.971
You all right?
Yeah.

10:04.004 --> 10:07.274
You were pretty tough
on Petty Officer Valez.

10:07.307 --> 10:09.376
She gave us what we needed,
she made a mistake.

10:09.409 --> 10:12.079
She made a choice,
and choices have consequences.

10:14.414 --> 10:16.717
All right, moving on.
I, uh, checked with NOPD,

10:16.750 --> 10:19.653
had them look into the address
of the party. Nothing.

10:19.687 --> 10:21.054
Warehouse was totally empty.

10:21.088 --> 10:22.723
So here's what's interesting.

10:22.756 --> 10:24.658
I checked the city records
about permits,

10:24.692 --> 10:26.059
see who maybe
organized the party.

10:26.093 --> 10:28.128
Turns out
it was a phantom company.

10:28.161 --> 10:30.230
So, what's the interesting part?

10:30.263 --> 10:33.734
You'll never guess whose office
signed off on the permit.

10:33.767 --> 10:36.003
Yeah, that's my assistant's
signature, but we got a lot

10:36.036 --> 10:37.671
of paperwork coming
through my office, Dwayne.

10:37.705 --> 10:39.707
Well, we think it's one
of these pop-up raves.

10:39.740 --> 10:42.976
Got to get on a text list
to get an invite.

10:43.010 --> 10:44.411
I'm working on that now.

10:44.444 --> 10:45.913
Yeah, and this concerns me why?

10:45.946 --> 10:47.748
You got four OD's,
all in your district.

10:47.781 --> 10:50.718
You're running for mayor
as the law and order guy.

10:50.751 --> 10:53.787
Doesn't really strike me
that you're mayoral material.

10:53.821 --> 10:55.756
All right, now wait.
Hold on. Just-just you...

10:55.789 --> 10:58.391
You want to call
your dog off, please?

10:58.425 --> 11:00.728
I thought we had a truce.

11:00.761 --> 11:02.963
Remains to be seen
if it's a longstanding one.

11:02.996 --> 11:05.132
It's my rave contact.

11:05.165 --> 11:07.701
I'll be back.

11:07.735 --> 11:11.739
Uh, Look, Dwayne, nobody wants
this dealer or dealers

11:11.772 --> 11:14.975
caught more
than yours truly, okay?

11:15.008 --> 11:18.912
Got my weasel of an opponent
who's taking every opportunity

11:18.946 --> 11:21.181
he can find to hang these deaths
around my neck.

11:21.214 --> 11:23.016
MAN:
Weasel

11:23.050 --> 11:25.352
I see myself more
like a ferret.

11:25.385 --> 11:27.788
Douglas, Dwayne.

11:27.821 --> 11:28.956
Mr. Singh.

11:28.989 --> 11:31.091
As for hanging things
around your neck,

11:31.124 --> 11:33.761
the Picayune's running
a big story on flakka tomorrow.

11:33.794 --> 11:35.462
Front page, above the fold.

11:35.495 --> 11:38.799
Gave them a great quote
about accountability.

11:38.832 --> 11:41.769
"Proud city. Clean city."

11:41.802 --> 11:43.737
You know, for somebody
who's not a politician,

11:43.771 --> 11:46.940
you spend an awful lot
of time in city hall.

11:46.974 --> 11:49.176
Just a local businessman
drumming up support.

11:49.209 --> 11:50.477
Or measuring the drapes.

11:52.179 --> 11:54.314
Drapes are for people
who need to hide things.

11:54.347 --> 11:57.885
A Singh administration
won't have that problem.

11:57.918 --> 12:01.254
Agent Lasalle,
hope I can count on your vote.

12:01.288 --> 12:04.224
Don't stick yourself
with that, Agent.

12:07.227 --> 12:09.830
We're in luck.
Party tonight.

12:09.863 --> 12:12.265
Got an address.

12:14.802 --> 12:18.405
(lively music playing,
loud chatter)

12:28.181 --> 12:31.551
Hey, check out dreads.

12:31.584 --> 12:33.453
Could be our dealer.

12:33.486 --> 12:36.323
BRODY:
Fits the description
Petty Officer Velez game.

12:37.590 --> 12:39.860
What up, my man?

12:39.893 --> 12:41.261
NCIS.

12:41.294 --> 12:42.830
I didn't do nothin', man.

12:42.863 --> 12:44.564
Yeah, you definitely
did something.

12:44.597 --> 12:46.299
Anthony.

12:47.868 --> 12:49.569
A lot of flakka
you got here.

12:49.602 --> 12:51.304
Step outside, my man.

12:51.338 --> 12:53.340
I must control the power.
I must control the power.

12:53.373 --> 12:55.508
Yo, this fool's high
on his own supply.

13:14.895 --> 13:16.096
SONJA:
Don't worry, y'all.

13:16.129 --> 13:19.232
He got lucky.

13:19.266 --> 13:21.368
PRIDE
Let me get this straight.

13:21.401 --> 13:24.271
There was one guy?

13:24.304 --> 13:27.908
He was like not human.

13:27.941 --> 13:29.409
A monster.

13:29.442 --> 13:32.179
But... one monster.

13:32.212 --> 13:33.847
Why you got
to rub it in?

13:35.949 --> 13:39.419
This, uh, monster
man have a name?

13:41.421 --> 13:42.956
Anthony Cousins.

13:42.990 --> 13:44.925
He dealt
to Petty Officer Weaver.

13:44.958 --> 13:46.626
BOLO's out.

13:46.659 --> 13:48.295
Local banger.

13:48.328 --> 13:50.397
Got a rap sheet
long as Percy here.

13:50.430 --> 13:52.432
Runs with the 1-1-3s.

13:52.465 --> 13:54.968
We'll have to pay a visit
to the 1-1-3s.

13:55.002 --> 13:59.106
Or maybe...
call out the National Guard.

14:00.573 --> 14:02.475
Pride.
What is it?

14:02.509 --> 14:04.011
BOLO just came back.

14:08.681 --> 14:10.517
Thanks for the call.

14:14.021 --> 14:15.555
Neighborhood woman found him.

14:15.588 --> 14:17.390
She was playing
with her seven year-old.

14:18.525 --> 14:19.927
Strangled.

14:19.960 --> 14:21.361
More than strangled.

14:21.394 --> 14:23.196
Garroted.

14:25.265 --> 14:26.599
Our coroner's on the way.

14:28.701 --> 14:32.139
Okay, so,
Anthony gets away from us.

14:32.172 --> 14:35.642
Likely runs back
to his buddies with the 1-1-3s.

14:35.675 --> 14:37.510
But we've made Anthony.

14:37.544 --> 14:40.580
They decide
it's easier to shut him up.

14:40.613 --> 14:42.950
Maybe, but a gun
could've done that.

14:42.983 --> 14:44.918
Garroting's more personal.

14:44.952 --> 14:46.920
It's a message.

14:46.954 --> 14:48.588
Message from who?

14:48.621 --> 14:50.490
SEBASTIAN:
Well, I can tell you this.

14:50.523 --> 14:52.025
It wasn't the 1-1-3s.

14:52.059 --> 14:53.526
Got another theory?

14:53.560 --> 14:55.929
Crime matches the same M.O.
as eight other murders,

14:55.963 --> 14:57.297
going back ten years.

14:57.330 --> 15:00.333
All drug-related,
all garrotings.

15:00.367 --> 15:03.603
The authorities think the killer
is a member of the Triads.

15:03.636 --> 15:06.006
Chinese crime syndicate.

15:06.039 --> 15:07.674
Major flakka importers.

15:07.707 --> 15:10.110
And for the first time,
we have DNA.

15:10.143 --> 15:12.012
How'd you manage that?

15:12.045 --> 15:13.513
Well, garroting is

15:13.546 --> 15:14.982
hard work, I would imagine,

15:15.015 --> 15:16.683
especially
in the Louisiana heat.

15:16.716 --> 15:20.153
Uh, so, not surprisingly,
our killer got a little sweaty.

15:20.187 --> 15:24.624
And his or her perspiration
fell onto our victim's body.

15:24.657 --> 15:26.193
DNA match in CODIS?

15:26.226 --> 15:27.627
No hits, but that doesn't mean

15:27.660 --> 15:29.096
the murderer
is entirely unknown.

15:29.129 --> 15:32.332
The authorities have a name--
The Ghost.

15:32.365 --> 15:34.134
The Ghost?

15:34.167 --> 15:38.038
Invisible, elusive, sinister.

15:38.071 --> 15:42.009
And responsible
for a decade-long killing spree.

15:56.523 --> 15:58.258
Talked to the DEA and the FBI.

15:58.291 --> 16:01.428
Every involved in investigating
The Ghost-- they got nothing.

16:01.461 --> 16:03.163
So, what we do know?

16:03.196 --> 16:05.432
The Ghost works
for the Triads-- major flakka

16:05.465 --> 16:07.267
manufacturer in China.

16:07.300 --> 16:08.768
They smuggle it
into the States,

16:08.801 --> 16:10.303
make alliances with
the local gangs,

16:10.337 --> 16:11.738
who do the
street-level dealing.

16:11.771 --> 16:14.574
In this case, the local dealers
are the 1-1-3s.

16:14.607 --> 16:17.444
So, let's find someone... alive

16:17.477 --> 16:19.146
from the 1-1-3s and see

16:19.179 --> 16:20.680
if they can't get us
a drop on The Ghost.

16:20.713 --> 16:22.582
And anyone else
behind the flakka

16:22.615 --> 16:24.184
that killed Petty
Officer Weaver.

16:27.187 --> 16:29.422
Sebastian.
I got it.

16:29.456 --> 16:32.225
Text Percy, tell
her to meet you.

16:34.561 --> 16:37.497
(loud, rapid,
rhythmic beeping)

16:37.530 --> 16:42.335
(loud, droning beep,
indistinct chatter)

16:45.838 --> 16:48.275
I'm sorry. Your friend is gone.

16:48.308 --> 16:51.078
My condolences.

16:52.645 --> 16:55.215
LASALLE:
Sorry it took me
so long to get here.

16:57.450 --> 16:59.552
Look, traffic was a mess.
Why are you creeping up on me?

16:59.586 --> 17:02.255
Walking down the hallway
isn't creeping.

17:02.289 --> 17:03.556
Look, your definition
of creeping

17:03.590 --> 17:05.725
and my definition of creeping
are different.

17:07.427 --> 17:09.296
Okay, now
you're staring-creeping.

17:09.329 --> 17:13.266
Look, people tell me
I'm an excellent listener.

17:13.300 --> 17:15.402
Ugh!
Come on.

17:15.435 --> 17:17.304
Don't you remember
our walk in the woods?

17:17.337 --> 17:20.140
You opened up, shared
your thoughts and feelings?

17:21.474 --> 17:23.076
Here I thought we had a bond.

17:23.110 --> 17:24.711
It's an old case.

17:24.744 --> 17:27.280
Everybody's got one.
Well, this one's mine.

17:27.314 --> 17:29.182
And I'm gonna keep my
thoughts and feelings

17:29.216 --> 17:32.119
to myself this time.

17:32.152 --> 17:33.753
Wordy Nerdy awaits us.

17:36.323 --> 17:37.724
Let me ask you this.

17:37.757 --> 17:39.459
Are you ready
to be amahzed?

17:39.492 --> 17:42.329
Connect The Ghost
to another crime?
No, no, no.

17:42.362 --> 17:45.298
That would be merely
impressive, maybe fortuitous,

17:45.332 --> 17:46.799
but not amahzing, which is

17:46.833 --> 17:48.368
the pronunciation
of "amazing" you use

17:48.401 --> 17:50.537
when you're about to
blow someone's dome.

17:50.570 --> 17:52.372
Just amahze us already.

17:52.405 --> 17:56.209
All right.
Forensic DNA Phenotyping.

17:56.243 --> 17:58.245
Yeah, you just rocked my world.

17:58.278 --> 18:00.413
SEBASTIAN:
Right? I mean,
this is next level cool.

18:00.447 --> 18:03.383
This is cool like hyper color
in the '90s kind of cool.

18:03.416 --> 18:05.252
What the
hell is it?

18:05.285 --> 18:07.254
All, right, well, say
you have someone's DNA,

18:07.287 --> 18:09.722
like from a droplet
of their sweat.

18:09.756 --> 18:13.660
I can pinpoint genetic markers
and recreate a simulated face.

18:13.693 --> 18:16.396
Okay, I'm not gonna lie.

18:16.429 --> 18:18.498
I am semi-mahzed.
Mm-hmm.

18:18.531 --> 18:22.369
But if this is so cool, why has
no one else done it before?

18:22.402 --> 18:24.604
Well, the tech is super new.

18:24.637 --> 18:26.506
It doesn't always work.

18:26.539 --> 18:28.141
Certain physical
characteristics depend

18:28.175 --> 18:29.376
on multiple gene pairings.

18:29.409 --> 18:32.545
But when it does work...
it's amahzing.

18:32.579 --> 18:37.517
So, this... is The Ghost?

18:37.550 --> 18:40.253
Well, no. This is just
sort of like the beginnings

18:40.287 --> 18:41.788
of what will eventually
become The Ghost.

18:41.821 --> 18:44.257
But I mean, come on. How many
days did it take to build Rome?

18:44.291 --> 18:45.625
Think it was a bunch.

18:45.658 --> 18:47.894
Right? Then why you
giving me a hard time?

18:49.462 --> 18:52.399
Pride's got a hit on the 1-1-3
stash house.

18:52.432 --> 18:56.603
Keep, uh, building Rome there.

18:56.636 --> 18:58.638
I mean, at this point,
it's just doing all the work.

18:58.671 --> 19:01.374
Five-O! Five-O! Five-O!

19:01.408 --> 19:03.476
Five-O!

19:03.510 --> 19:05.512
Let's go!

19:09.816 --> 19:11.551
Hands in the air! Now!

19:11.584 --> 19:14.187
On the ground!
Hands where we can see 'em!

19:16.756 --> 19:19.192
(indistinct,
overlapping shouting)

19:22.395 --> 19:24.331
I suggest
you get on the ground.

19:24.364 --> 19:26.266
You know what?
I think I'm good.

19:26.299 --> 19:27.900
It's a new shirt, you know?

19:36.409 --> 19:39.579
Now, you can send us
your dry cleaning bill.

19:47.587 --> 19:50.523
Quite a flakka supply we found
at your stash house, Kendrick.

19:50.557 --> 19:52.892
That what that is?

19:52.925 --> 19:54.694
Shot caller for the 1-1-3s.

19:54.727 --> 19:56.396
Thought you'd be more
in the know.

19:56.429 --> 19:59.999
Where'd you get the drugs?

20:00.032 --> 20:04.003
Well, maybe if she came over
here and, uh, sat in my lap...

20:04.036 --> 20:05.438
might jog my memory.

20:05.472 --> 20:06.873
Oh, that sounds super appealing,

20:06.906 --> 20:09.409
but... pass.

20:09.442 --> 20:10.677
Charming as you are, Kendrick,

20:10.710 --> 20:13.380
we don't see you
as the logistics type.

20:13.413 --> 20:15.748
You sure ain't smart enough to
make all that flakka yourself.

20:15.782 --> 20:17.784
What we think...

20:17.817 --> 20:20.387
Triads are your suppliers.

20:20.420 --> 20:22.522
Specifically, someone known
as The Ghost.

20:26.926 --> 20:29.429
Lawyer.
Oh, we can get you
a lawyer.

20:29.462 --> 20:32.765
But your drugs killed a sailor.

20:32.799 --> 20:34.934
Louisiana law says
that's murder.

20:34.967 --> 20:36.903
Now, you help us
find The Ghost,

20:36.936 --> 20:38.638
we can put in a word
with the judge.

20:38.671 --> 20:41.408
I'd rather take
the death penalty

20:41.441 --> 20:43.443
than mess with The Ghost,
you feel me?

20:44.611 --> 20:46.846
Now get me my damn lawyer.

20:49.549 --> 20:50.783
I'm supposed to tell you
to build Rome faster

20:50.817 --> 20:52.485
'cause we got a whole
lot of nothing.

20:52.519 --> 20:54.887
Rome's coming along, just a
little slower than I thought.

20:54.921 --> 20:57.824
But, uh, I built
the Colosseum,

20:57.857 --> 20:59.526
I'm working on the
Trevi Fountain,

20:59.559 --> 21:01.361
and any minute now this
puppy's gonna launch

21:01.394 --> 21:02.562
into the Sistine Chapel.

21:02.595 --> 21:03.996
So nothing
on The Ghost?

21:04.030 --> 21:05.598
But not nothing at all.

21:05.632 --> 21:08.601
Let us return for a moment
to our other project.

21:08.635 --> 21:11.338
Do you remember when I told
you that, uh, beyond you,

21:11.371 --> 21:12.539
there were other added
elements to the photo?

21:12.572 --> 21:13.973
Yeah, a cup, a watch.

21:14.006 --> 21:16.976
Right, so I isolated
the photoshopped items,

21:17.009 --> 21:18.711
and I ran a pattern-
recognition analysis

21:18.745 --> 21:20.513
to play "connect the dots."

21:20.547 --> 21:21.814
Look at this.

21:21.848 --> 21:24.417
First I didn't know
what it meant.

21:24.451 --> 21:25.685
But then I realized
that every photo

21:25.718 --> 21:27.520
has a number hidden within it.

21:27.554 --> 21:29.055
This one's seven.

21:30.457 --> 21:32.625
Nine, one, two,
five, nine.

21:32.659 --> 21:34.627
Yeah, I found numbers in six
of the pictures so far.

21:34.661 --> 21:35.595
I'm working on the rest.

21:35.628 --> 21:37.063
This is insane.

21:37.096 --> 21:38.665
Would you say it's
"ah

21:40.099 --> 21:41.300
Oh, Rome's done.

21:45.672 --> 21:49.842
That is the artist formerly
known as The Ghost.

21:52.579 --> 21:54.781
Ran him through the
criminal database and nada.

21:54.814 --> 21:58.618
So I took a little turn to
the DMV site, and hello.

21:58.651 --> 22:00.620
Meet Roger Liu.

22:00.653 --> 22:02.655
Chinese national.

22:02.689 --> 22:04.857
Lived in the U.S.
the last 12 years.

22:04.891 --> 22:06.659
No criminal record.

22:06.693 --> 22:08.495
Runs a legitimate company
here in New Orleans--

22:08.528 --> 22:10.530
Janco Industries,
chemical engineering.

22:10.563 --> 22:12.565
Yeah, good cover
for importing flakka.

22:12.599 --> 22:14.867
Yeah, but a businessman who
likes getting his hands dirty?

22:14.901 --> 22:17.570
Yeah, sociopaths come
in all shapes and sizes.

22:17.604 --> 22:19.806
Looks like the sociopath got
the hell out of Dodge.

22:19.839 --> 22:22.875
Went to Liu's home,
the man is gone "pec-awhn."

22:22.909 --> 22:24.711
So we got a warrant
for Liu's financials.

22:24.744 --> 22:27.146
Turns out, he's
got hidden assets

22:27.179 --> 22:28.548
in several shell
companies.

22:28.581 --> 22:31.384
If he's got a hideout,
we will find it.

22:31.418 --> 22:34.020
Aw, he must have ran once he got
word of the raid on the 1-1-3s.

22:34.053 --> 22:37.690
But there is someone who
might know where to find him.

22:37.724 --> 22:39.692
This is security footage

22:39.726 --> 22:41.528
from the security
camera at Liu's office.

22:41.561 --> 22:44.997
So Liu's had a special visitor
several times this week.

22:45.031 --> 22:47.734
Same period
as the flakka boom.

22:47.767 --> 22:50.603
Our pal, the
councilman.

22:52.004 --> 22:54.574
Flakka problem is based
in Hamilton's district.

22:54.607 --> 22:56.976
Liu wants to deal
in Hamilton's backyard,

22:57.009 --> 22:58.611
maybe he's paying
for protection.

22:58.645 --> 23:02.749
Yeah, well, looks like
our truce is over.

23:13.893 --> 23:16.128
You claim a strong record
on crime, Councilman.

23:16.162 --> 23:18.030
How do you reconcile
that with the flakka

23:18.064 --> 23:19.899
flooding into the very
districts you represent?

23:19.932 --> 23:22.735
Well, first, I don't claim
to be strong on crime,

23:22.769 --> 23:24.571
I am strong on crime,

23:24.604 --> 23:27.206
as evidenced by the NOPD's
endorsement of me.

23:27.239 --> 23:30.142
And second, I think it's
beneath you, frankly,

23:30.176 --> 23:32.745
to seek to exploit
these recent deaths

23:32.779 --> 23:34.747
as a way of going
for my throat.

23:34.781 --> 23:37.817
PRIDE: Think it's a pretty
good tactic, actually.

23:37.850 --> 23:39.118
HAMILTON:
Dwayne.

23:39.151 --> 23:42.021
Uh, we happen to be
in mid-debate prep.

23:42.054 --> 23:43.556
Can this wait?

23:43.590 --> 23:44.724
Cannot.

23:44.757 --> 23:46.559
It cannot, all right.

23:46.593 --> 23:47.960
All right, um...

23:47.994 --> 23:50.062
Everybody, just take
a five-minute break.

23:50.096 --> 23:51.531
Chris, would you?
Yeah.
Thanks.

23:55.868 --> 23:57.136
Roger Liu.

23:57.169 --> 23:58.571
Ring a bell?

23:58.605 --> 24:00.473
You accusing me of something?

24:00.507 --> 24:02.475
Giving you a chance
to come clean.

24:02.509 --> 24:04.911
DÃ©jÃ  vu all
over again.

24:04.944 --> 24:07.480
In one week, you make
three visits to his office.

24:07.514 --> 24:09.916
Same week that flakka goes big.

24:09.949 --> 24:14.487
And, surprise, Liu works for the
syndicate that's importing it.

24:14.521 --> 24:16.122
I know him as a businessman

24:16.155 --> 24:17.990
from whom I was hoping
to solicit campaign funds,

24:18.024 --> 24:19.225
and it didn't work out.

24:19.258 --> 24:20.993
No?

24:21.027 --> 24:23.630
I'll give you access
to everything.

24:23.663 --> 24:26.866
Full financial cavity search,
if that blows your skirt up.

24:26.899 --> 24:29.869
Uh, look, I'll even, uh, arrange
another meeting with him,

24:29.902 --> 24:31.704
and you and your
merry band of agents

24:31.738 --> 24:33.239
can tag along
and pick him up.

24:33.272 --> 24:34.674
He's in the wind.

24:36.743 --> 24:38.177
You don't have a line into him?

24:41.047 --> 24:44.050
Got a guy, Kendrick Lewis.

24:44.083 --> 24:46.118
Kendrick Lewis--
1-1-3s.

24:46.152 --> 24:47.554
Yeah, I know of him.

24:47.587 --> 24:50.189
We think Kendrick
can lead us to Liu,

24:50.222 --> 24:51.490
but he won't talk.

24:53.292 --> 24:54.927
And what if I could help?

24:56.629 --> 24:59.866
Kendrick's grandmother wants
into an assisted living facility

24:59.899 --> 25:01.500
in my district.

25:03.102 --> 25:05.071
Facility manager calls me up
for protection.

25:05.104 --> 25:07.273
Doesn't want anybody
with gang relations.

25:07.306 --> 25:09.041
He's afraid of retribution.

25:09.075 --> 25:10.743
Are you suggesting...?

25:10.777 --> 25:12.745
Well, maybe I
call him back,

25:12.779 --> 25:14.614
see if he can open
up another room.

25:14.647 --> 25:15.982
Convenient.

25:16.015 --> 25:18.585
You patrol the streets...

25:18.618 --> 25:20.620
I grease the wheels.

25:22.589 --> 25:24.223
Percy!

25:24.256 --> 25:26.225
Kendrick,

25:26.258 --> 25:28.260
your grandmother's moving
into the facility tonight.

25:30.096 --> 25:31.263
KENDRICK: With
24

25:31.297 --> 25:33.299
Yes, that's the deal.

25:37.336 --> 25:40.139
Okay, fancy folks, now what?

25:40.172 --> 25:42.341
Now you get off my desk.

25:42.374 --> 25:44.677
So, again, no with the lap?

25:44.711 --> 25:46.312
SONJA :
Yeah.
You're not respectful,

25:46.345 --> 25:50.549
I look the other way, her
knee ends up in your lap.

25:53.285 --> 25:56.188
KENDRICK: Well, look, I got
to be straight with y'all.

25:56.222 --> 25:58.190
Finding Liu ain't
easy, a'ight?

25:58.224 --> 25:59.592
There's a number
to a voice mail,

25:59.626 --> 26:01.027
I leave a message,

26:01.060 --> 26:03.162
he contacts you
when he's ready.

26:03.195 --> 26:05.197
Tell him you just got
out of custody.

26:05.231 --> 26:06.599
He'll want to talk.

26:06.633 --> 26:08.601
So I just walk out of here?

26:08.635 --> 26:10.202
For the moment.

26:10.236 --> 26:13.205
When Liu gets in touch,

26:13.239 --> 26:16.042
tell him you want to meet.

26:16.075 --> 26:19.245
The 1-1-3s have taken
a-a major hit.

26:19.278 --> 26:21.881
You want to keep dealing...

26:23.916 --> 26:26.719
...but you need more manpower.

26:26.753 --> 26:30.056
Then you make
an introduction to me.

26:30.089 --> 26:31.858
Oh, hell no.

26:31.891 --> 26:33.860
Now, look, I spent
my entire career undercover.

26:33.893 --> 26:35.762
Got an alias to back it up.

26:35.795 --> 26:39.732
Even got a trap house, which is
where I'll be from now on.

26:41.033 --> 26:43.135
I know what I'm doing.

26:43.169 --> 26:44.170
Tracking devices.

26:46.172 --> 26:47.306
Set the meet.

26:48.908 --> 26:50.276
Let us know when it's happening.

26:52.011 --> 26:53.646
We'll be there to arrest Liu.

27:07.159 --> 27:09.328
Saw the light last night.

27:09.361 --> 27:12.331
Did you sleep at all?

27:12.364 --> 27:13.733
Don't sleep.

27:13.766 --> 27:15.301
Since when?

27:17.036 --> 27:18.237
Since my sister died.

27:20.873 --> 27:23.209
These photos are bringing
everything back up.

27:23.242 --> 27:25.211
I keep thinking

27:25.244 --> 27:29.215
of the call I got
from my mother,

27:29.248 --> 27:32.151
telling me that Emily
had been killed.

27:32.184 --> 27:35.354
Before the call, I was
this-this Agent Afloat,

27:35.387 --> 27:37.356
starting this new career.

27:37.389 --> 27:39.091
Life couldn't have been better.

27:39.125 --> 27:42.228
After the call,
I live in this world

27:42.261 --> 27:45.264
where... I'll never see
my sister again.

27:47.266 --> 27:49.235
If that call had to come,

27:49.268 --> 27:53.239
if it could have come
a minute later,

27:53.272 --> 27:54.774
five minutes later even...

27:54.807 --> 27:56.142
Or never.

27:57.810 --> 28:01.280
Anything to delay having
to go from before to after.

28:02.514 --> 28:05.317
Well, that would keep me up too.

28:18.264 --> 28:20.867
SONJA: Clara just died,
and you're getting high?

28:23.335 --> 28:25.504
Don't get all up
in my crap, Sonja.

28:25.537 --> 28:27.974
SONJA: I'm trying
to save your life, Marion!

28:28.007 --> 28:29.341
Don't bother!

28:51.397 --> 28:52.832
Yo, what the hell?

28:54.133 --> 28:56.502
Yo, what's the deal, Kendrick?

28:56.535 --> 28:58.938
KENDRICK:
He's with Liu, he's cool.

28:58.971 --> 29:01.440
Ain't nothing cool about
surprising me in my own house.

29:01.473 --> 29:04.276
You want to do business
with Liu? Chill.

29:05.577 --> 29:07.780
Chillin'.

29:09.415 --> 29:11.550
So... meeting, when?
Now.

29:11.583 --> 29:13.052
Well, now is not a good time.

29:13.085 --> 29:14.086
Now's your only choice.

29:15.287 --> 29:16.455
Then now it is.

29:16.488 --> 29:18.057
Off we go.

29:18.090 --> 29:19.859
First, your gun, your phone.

29:21.160 --> 29:23.029
I could pat you down
if you want.

29:28.134 --> 29:30.036
Move.

29:41.347 --> 29:43.449
New blood.

29:43.482 --> 29:45.184
Welcome.

29:45.217 --> 29:47.419
I hope, uh, Vincent
didn't frighten you.

29:47.453 --> 29:48.821
I'm cool.

29:48.855 --> 29:51.357
I'm told you, uh,
may be of assistance.

29:51.390 --> 29:53.592
If moving product's
what you mean.

29:53.625 --> 29:55.461
She works the same areas
we've been distributing.

29:55.494 --> 29:57.196
Was I talking to you?

29:59.398 --> 30:01.367
Got tons of access.

30:01.400 --> 30:05.004
You got something to sell,
I got someone to buy.

30:05.037 --> 30:07.974
Sounds excellent.

30:08.007 --> 30:09.976
Ten pounds.

30:10.009 --> 30:11.410
Start with that.

30:11.443 --> 30:13.412
Now, how much is that
gonna cost me?

30:13.445 --> 30:17.316
Get the product on the streets,
we'll talk finances later.

30:19.485 --> 30:20.853
A'ight, then.

30:20.887 --> 30:22.021
Think this...

30:29.028 --> 30:31.397
Only so many mistakes
can be tolerated.

30:31.430 --> 30:33.632
In any business.

30:33.665 --> 30:35.134
Agreed.

30:35.167 --> 30:37.836
LIU: Vincent, the
garrote, please.

30:39.505 --> 30:43.409
Know the most important aspect
of any business relationship?

30:46.078 --> 30:48.080
Trust.

30:53.585 --> 30:55.121
Let's see if you deserve it.

31:05.697 --> 31:08.034
You guys got anything?
LASALLE:
No, we ain't heard from Percy.

31:08.067 --> 31:10.436
No movement
on the tracking devices.

31:10.469 --> 31:11.670
We're three minutes out.

31:11.703 --> 31:13.973
Turning off Chef Menteur now.

31:17.076 --> 31:19.578
Look, I'm trying
to be your dealer, all right?

31:19.611 --> 31:21.513
Not your killer.

31:21.547 --> 31:22.681
One in the same.

31:22.714 --> 31:25.051
Then we have a problem.

31:26.585 --> 31:28.955
You know... I think we might.

31:31.090 --> 31:32.558
Short relationship we had.

31:33.325 --> 31:36.362
Hey, yo, calm... down.

31:36.395 --> 31:39.698
All right?

31:39.731 --> 31:42.201
I'll do it.

31:50.042 --> 31:52.511
Take a deep breath.

31:52.544 --> 31:54.113
Finish it already.

32:06.058 --> 32:07.960
Where'd they go?

32:07.994 --> 32:10.997
They're under the dock.

32:13.699 --> 32:17.036
PRIDE:
NCIS. Hands in the air.

32:19.438 --> 32:21.573
Sonja? Sonja!

32:32.251 --> 32:35.721
All right. Ready?
Come on.

32:39.291 --> 32:41.493
Take your time
why don't you?

32:47.766 --> 32:49.635
PRIDE:
Thank you.

32:51.303 --> 32:55.307
EMTs said he's
stabilized, gonna make it.

32:55.341 --> 32:57.676
Thank you.

32:57.709 --> 32:59.178
I owe you one.

32:59.211 --> 33:01.413
Just glad you're okay.

33:01.447 --> 33:05.317
Something gnawing at me.
What?

33:05.351 --> 33:08.087
So, when Liu gave me the drugs,

33:08.120 --> 33:10.789
I asked him
about money, payments.

33:10.822 --> 33:13.125
And Liu said--
and I quote--

33:13.159 --> 33:16.028
"We'll talk finances later."

33:16.062 --> 33:20.132
Drug kingpin not interested
in making money?

33:20.166 --> 33:23.135
I feel like
we're missing a big piece.

33:23.169 --> 33:25.337
We'll go back
over Liu's finances.

33:25.371 --> 33:27.173
Already on it.

33:27.206 --> 33:31.043
Figured the newbie needed
a moment to drip dry.

33:31.077 --> 33:34.680
Liu was super flush.
Big payments, recent.

33:34.713 --> 33:37.749
Money that was sent all over
the globe to hide its origin.

33:37.783 --> 33:39.451
We found where it came from.

33:40.419 --> 33:44.390
$500,000 in a slush fund.

33:44.423 --> 33:47.193
Political slush fund.

33:47.226 --> 33:49.628
Political?

33:55.201 --> 33:59.305
No, no, no. Dwayne, Dwayne,
I do not have time for this.

33:59.338 --> 34:01.140
The debate's in an hour.

34:01.173 --> 34:03.109
That's a snazzy-looking
suit, Mr. Hamilton.

34:03.142 --> 34:04.410
All right, what is this?

34:04.443 --> 34:05.811
I'm told that

34:05.844 --> 34:08.380
you got your dealer,
you got your distributor.

34:08.414 --> 34:11.083
Need one more thing:
the financier.

34:11.117 --> 34:12.718
You kidding me?

34:12.751 --> 34:14.553
I thought we've been
through this.

34:14.586 --> 34:15.621
I've been nothing
but helpful.

34:15.654 --> 34:18.624
Yes, you have.

34:18.657 --> 34:20.659
Gonna owe me, Doug.

34:20.692 --> 34:22.161
Excuse me, fellas.

34:22.194 --> 34:24.630
Dwayne, hope you'll come
to the debate,

34:24.663 --> 34:27.199
cheer me on.

34:27.233 --> 34:29.335
There's not gonna
be a debate.

34:29.368 --> 34:31.170
Here's your button back.

34:31.203 --> 34:32.771
Hands behind your
back, Mr. Singh.

34:32.804 --> 34:36.642
You're under arrest.

34:36.675 --> 34:38.610
$500,000

34:38.644 --> 34:41.647
from your campaign
to Roger Liu.

34:41.680 --> 34:43.149
Traditionally,
during campaign season,

34:43.182 --> 34:44.716
the crooks pay off
the politicians,

34:44.750 --> 34:46.385
not the other way around.

34:46.418 --> 34:47.886
Looks like
you rewrote the playbook.

34:47.919 --> 34:49.388
Don't know
what you're suggesting.

34:49.421 --> 34:51.257
BRODY:
We are alleging

34:51.290 --> 34:54.793
you paid a drug dealer to swamp
Hamilton's district with flakka.

34:54.826 --> 34:57.263
Looks bad for Hamilton,

34:57.296 --> 34:59.331
gives a narrative
to your campaign.

34:59.365 --> 35:00.799
"Proud city. Clean city?"

35:00.832 --> 35:02.868
Maybe not so much.

35:02.901 --> 35:05.637
This is ridiculous.

35:05.671 --> 35:07.506
My guess?

35:07.539 --> 35:10.776
Hamilton's behind this,
got someone inside my staff.

35:10.809 --> 35:12.678
This is just politics.

35:12.711 --> 35:15.814
No. No, Mr. Singh, it is not.

35:15.847 --> 35:17.449
It is Isley Markland,

35:17.483 --> 35:19.818
Jennifer Livingston,
Brooks Gostin.

35:19.851 --> 35:23.589
US Navy Petty Officer
2nd Class Kelsey Weaver.

35:23.622 --> 35:26.825
People have weaknesses,
make mistakes.

35:26.858 --> 35:29.261
I can find compassion for them.

35:29.295 --> 35:31.930
But I got no compassion...

35:31.963 --> 35:36.268
for people who profit off
those weaknesses, who know...

35:36.302 --> 35:38.770
that one mistake means death.

35:42.708 --> 35:46.212
People... like you.

35:49.481 --> 35:51.283
SEBASTIAN:
Those are all the numbers.

35:51.317 --> 35:53.885
It's too short for
a phone number.

35:53.919 --> 35:56.688
It's not a map coordinate.

35:56.722 --> 35:58.690
Bar code, maybe a serial number?

35:58.724 --> 36:03.529
Maybe some sort of multiple of
the Euler

36:03.562 --> 36:05.664
I'm just thinking
outside the box.

36:07.233 --> 36:09.235
Wait.

36:09.268 --> 36:10.869
If there are nine numbers...

36:10.902 --> 36:12.838
that could work
as an IP address.

36:12.871 --> 36:15.541
Let me, uh, running a
permutation generator

36:15.574 --> 36:18.244
and attach it to a
search of Web sites.

36:20.279 --> 36:21.880
Okay, well,
there's one potential match.

36:21.913 --> 36:23.882
A petting zoo.

36:23.915 --> 36:27.753
Also, a chiropractor, and...

36:29.821 --> 36:31.757
Unsolved crimes Web site.

36:31.790 --> 36:33.759
Yeah, this is a...
this is a forum

36:33.792 --> 36:34.993
for anonymous users
to post evidence.

36:35.026 --> 36:36.695
I've been on it before. It's...

36:36.728 --> 36:38.830
It's legit.

36:38.864 --> 36:41.867
Um... Merri.

36:44.403 --> 36:47.739
Click it.

36:47.773 --> 36:49.408
"It is our conclusion that

36:49.441 --> 36:51.843
"the death
of Emily Anne Brody, ruled

36:51.877 --> 36:55.581
an accident at the hands of a
drunk driver, was anything but."

36:55.614 --> 36:57.249
SEBASTIAN:
"It's further
our conclusion

36:57.283 --> 36:59.785
"that Ms. Brody's death
should be considered

36:59.818 --> 37:02.588
an unsolved murder."

37:07.859 --> 37:10.429
I'll, uh...

37:10.462 --> 37:12.898
I'll give you some space.

37:28.880 --> 37:30.682
See you next time.
Next time.

37:30.716 --> 37:32.451
You bet.

37:32.484 --> 37:34.320
Nice to see you, Agent Percy.

37:34.353 --> 37:36.622
:
Who was that?

37:36.655 --> 37:37.956
Agent out of Washington.

37:37.989 --> 37:39.391
Mm.

37:41.860 --> 37:43.995
Just sold my...

37:44.029 --> 37:46.965
unofficial first drink.

37:48.467 --> 37:50.436
Well, I was in the
office when you called,

37:50.469 --> 37:53.305
so I was there to receive this.

37:53.339 --> 37:54.806
Dropped off by

37:54.840 --> 37:56.442
you favorite councilman.

37:56.475 --> 37:57.809
Said you can wear it next year.

37:57.843 --> 38:00.646
My new best friend.

38:00.679 --> 38:04.350
So, wh did you need
my help with?

38:04.383 --> 38:06.785
I need your help understanding

38:06.818 --> 38:10.356
what's been going on
the last few days.

38:10.389 --> 38:11.990
You've been talking
to Merri and Chris.

38:12.023 --> 38:15.461
And watching myself.

38:15.494 --> 38:17.863
You were spooked

38:17.896 --> 38:19.965
the moment Loretta opened
those drawers at the morgue.

38:19.998 --> 38:22.868
You know, like I told Lasalle--

38:22.901 --> 38:25.904
it's an old case,
it's ancient history.

38:25.937 --> 38:27.973
I got to be honest.

38:28.006 --> 38:31.009
Don't believe
either of those things are true.

38:36.882 --> 38:38.984
There were three of us.

38:39.017 --> 38:41.687
We were best friends
since we were little.

38:42.954 --> 38:45.323
We were good kids, mostly.

38:46.525 --> 38:49.661
Then... high school.

38:49.695 --> 38:52.964
Boys... liquor...

38:52.998 --> 38:54.833
drugs.

38:57.002 --> 39:00.005
One day, we got a hold
of some coke.

39:00.038 --> 39:02.107
What we didn't know--

39:02.140 --> 39:05.444
the dealer cut it
with pesticides.

39:06.712 --> 39:10.081
So one of us ended up
in the hospital.

39:12.083 --> 39:14.119
The other one, the morgue.

39:14.152 --> 39:16.455
And the third?

39:18.824 --> 39:20.992
Lost touch.

39:21.026 --> 39:24.830
It's my experience...

39:24.863 --> 39:27.098
when you can't
shake something...

39:28.967 --> 39:31.069
...best to look straight at it.

39:49.555 --> 39:51.156
Say, little mama,
what's your pleasure, huh?

39:51.189 --> 39:52.791
What you like?

39:52.824 --> 39:54.125
Nothing you're selling.

39:54.159 --> 39:57.028
All right, well, then,
I suggest you run along.

39:57.062 --> 40:00.499
Man, I do what
I want when I want.

40:00.532 --> 40:05.537
Look, tell Marion
she should call Sonja sometime.
