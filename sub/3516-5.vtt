WEBVTT

00:01.200 --> 00:02.610
What do you think
of Darren Jarvis?

00:02.760 --> 00:04.171
At CBS?

00:04.240 --> 00:05.605
He wants me to be
a correspondent.

00:05.680 --> 00:07.205
It's not
worth your time.

00:08.440 --> 00:10.090
What about Greer Fisher,
at MSNBC?

00:11.000 --> 00:13.685
Stick to writing,
do TV on the side.

00:13.760 --> 00:15.489
You're more than
a talking head.

00:17.240 --> 00:18.446
<i>How about Slugline?</i>

00:18.560 --> 00:19.766
<i>What's Slugline?</i>

00:20.280 --> 00:24.080
<i>If I said Politico wanted to
hire me, what would you say?</i>

00:24.160 --> 00:25.844
I would say that
that piques my interest.

00:26.000 --> 00:27.968
Six months from now,
Slugline will be

00:28.080 --> 00:30.048
<i>what Politico was
a year and half ago.</i>

00:30.200 --> 00:31.326
<i>Everyone at Politico
reads it</i>

00:31.400 --> 00:33.209
because Slugline's breaking
stories before they are.

00:33.280 --> 00:34.930
I wonder why I've
never heard of it.

00:35.000 --> 00:36.047
Everyone's
a free agent.

00:36.120 --> 00:38.646
And they write whatever they
want, wherever they are.

00:38.720 --> 00:40.290
Most people write
from their phones.

00:40.360 --> 00:43.364
Well, if freedom and exposure
are what they're offering,

00:43.480 --> 00:46.324
I would say that is
a meeting worth taking.

00:46.680 --> 00:49.126
This Hammerschmidt
thing is blowing up.

00:49.200 --> 00:51.089
I think he might
get fired.

00:51.160 --> 00:52.571
There's got to be
a thousand tweets here...

00:52.640 --> 00:55.086
People defending me,
people trashing me.

00:55.200 --> 00:57.521
There's even a hashtag,
GoZoe.

00:57.600 --> 00:58.601
Hmm.

01:01.640 --> 01:02.641
Hey!

01:03.560 --> 01:04.641
We mustn't leave
any trails.

01:04.760 --> 01:05.807
All of my contacts
were in there.

01:05.880 --> 01:09.327
Then it's time for you
to get some new contacts.

01:13.280 --> 01:15.442
Don't worry. I'll get you a phone.
I'll get you two, in fact.

01:15.520 --> 01:17.568
One for work
and a burner for play.

01:17.680 --> 01:19.409
Expect them
this afternoon.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.321
Oh, and... Go, Zoe.

01:26.000 --> 01:32.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:36.600 --> 03:37.647
The reporter?

03:37.760 --> 03:38.807
Yes.

03:41.320 --> 03:42.845
Just this once?

03:46.720 --> 03:48.290
I'm not sure.

03:49.520 --> 03:51.443
What does she offer us?

03:52.680 --> 03:54.205
A mouthpiece,
when we need one.

03:54.280 --> 03:56.009
She's been
very useful so far.

03:56.360 --> 03:57.964
What does she want?
Access.

03:58.040 --> 03:59.929
A seat at the table.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.082
Sounds like she's getting the
better side of the bargain.

04:03.280 --> 04:05.123
She can be controlled.

04:05.200 --> 04:06.690
Are you sure?

04:06.920 --> 04:08.206
She can.
I promise you.

04:09.880 --> 04:11.325
Okay, if you say so.

04:12.320 --> 04:13.890
The moment you
want me to end it...

04:13.960 --> 04:15.724
I know, Francis.

04:19.200 --> 04:20.850
I should get
ready for work.

04:34.840 --> 04:35.921
Hey...

04:36.000 --> 04:38.321
I didn't think
you'd be in until later.

04:38.400 --> 04:40.050
This is your
agenda for the day.

04:40.200 --> 04:41.850
Here's your schedule
for the rest of the week.

04:41.920 --> 04:43.968
These are papers that need
to be approved or signed.

04:44.040 --> 04:46.042
Over here are your one-sheets
for committee meetings

04:46.120 --> 04:49.169
and briefs on upcoming
legislative action.

04:49.240 --> 04:52.244
I filled Ashley in. She can cover
until you find a replacement.

05:01.120 --> 05:02.360
Christina.

05:03.560 --> 05:04.686
What?

05:08.280 --> 05:09.691
Thank you.

05:10.160 --> 05:12.731
For getting
all this in order.

05:17.560 --> 05:21.451
Ashley can call me if you have any
questions about what's on your desk.

05:26.040 --> 05:27.087
He here yet?

05:27.200 --> 05:28.247
I put him
in your office.

05:33.920 --> 05:36.810
Marty Spinella. Head lobbyist
for the teachers union.

05:36.880 --> 05:39.326
He wants to rip my head off
and peel it like an orange.

05:39.440 --> 05:42.205
Why? Because I lied to him.
But what choice did I have?

05:42.320 --> 05:45.802
When the truth would have ended
the conversation before it began?

05:45.880 --> 05:47.564
I'll call you back.
Marty.

05:49.560 --> 05:51.324
You fucking lied, Frank?

05:51.400 --> 05:53.402
No, no,no.
You lie to my fucking face?

05:53.520 --> 05:55.363
Marty, I did not lie. What
do you mean you did not?

05:55.440 --> 05:57.124
We spent a whole
weekend in that room

05:57.280 --> 05:58.964
poring over this bill
line by line.

05:59.040 --> 06:01.884
And nowhere did it say anything
about collective bargaining.

06:01.960 --> 06:04.884
Let's calm down and sit down.
And we will discuss this.

06:04.960 --> 06:08.169
I will explain everything that's
going on and we will talk it out.

06:08.280 --> 06:09.884
No matter how long it takes.
No. No more.

06:09.960 --> 06:11.450
This is gonna be
a very short meeting.

06:11.520 --> 06:13.682
'Cause only one of two
things are going to happen.

06:13.800 --> 06:16.804
Either you assure me right
now that amendment is out,

06:16.880 --> 06:19.884
or I am walking out that door and I
am gonna start launching missiles.

06:19.960 --> 06:22.406
The amendment was never
intended to stay in the bill.

06:22.480 --> 06:23.811
It's just there for leverage.
That's all.

06:23.880 --> 06:27.726
You threaten to cut federal funding
from union school districts?

06:27.800 --> 06:30.644
That's not a poker chip, Frank,
that's a goddamn dirty bomb.

06:30.720 --> 06:34.884
Look, the amendment
is not staying in the bill.

06:36.200 --> 06:39.170
I just need you to work with
me on performance standards.

06:39.520 --> 06:40.760
Performance standards?

06:41.680 --> 06:44.206
Are you fucking kidding me? You
agreed that they were already out.

06:44.320 --> 06:46.209
You can't just put it back in now, Frank.
Marty, look...

06:46.280 --> 06:48.089
I have a reputation
to uphold.

06:48.160 --> 06:51.562
I am the one that made the
union reps stay here for you

06:51.680 --> 06:54.160
while you're in Gaffney playing
with your fucking Peachoid.

06:54.240 --> 06:55.366
Marty...
You tell me right now,

06:55.440 --> 06:57.124
is that amendment
in or out?

06:57.960 --> 07:01.851
There is a middle ground here, Marty.
We just have to find it.

07:03.920 --> 07:05.843
I take that as a no.

07:08.840 --> 07:10.080
Okay.

07:12.200 --> 07:15.761
Marty, do not start a war
you know you're gonna lose.

07:15.840 --> 07:17.968
You fuck me,
I fuck back.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.161
Stamper!

07:24.240 --> 07:26.561
Marty and I have a good
working relationship.

07:26.640 --> 07:27.641
Or used to.

07:27.720 --> 07:28.881
You could see
he has a temper,

07:28.960 --> 07:31.122
but I can usually cut through
that and reason with him.

07:31.200 --> 07:34.363
But I may have pushed him too far.
Which is worrisome.

07:34.440 --> 07:36.761
Friends make
the worst enemies.

07:38.920 --> 07:40.763
How'd it go?
What'd you hear?

07:40.880 --> 07:43.963
A lot of fucks. Well,
that pretty much says it.

07:44.560 --> 07:45.891
Let's think
this through...

07:45.960 --> 07:47.200
No, we've got the DNC
leadership meeting.

07:47.400 --> 07:48.640
What?

07:48.720 --> 07:51.121
I'd say you could skip it, but
Birch just dumped it on us.

07:51.280 --> 07:53.567
When? It's here. In 12 minutes.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.324
Why here and not
the DNC headquarters?

07:55.440 --> 07:58.603
The DNC is doing renovations, they're
gonna be green-energy efficient.

07:58.680 --> 08:01.570
That's a charming
use of party funds.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.321
We've only been in this
space about three months.

08:04.760 --> 08:05.921
It's cool.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.889
Not exactly
The Herald, is it?

08:07.960 --> 08:10.566
Have you been to those offices?
Yes.

08:10.680 --> 08:12.842
Wrist-slitting was in order.

08:13.240 --> 08:15.561
So, who else
is courting you?

08:16.080 --> 08:17.127
A few people.

08:17.240 --> 08:18.321
You mean everyone.

08:19.040 --> 08:20.690
There were a lot of
emails this morning...

08:20.760 --> 08:22.091
That's not surprising.

08:22.160 --> 08:24.640
You're having a moment,
people are interested.

08:24.720 --> 08:26.006
I'm one of them.

08:26.080 --> 08:28.765
But if eight minutes passes
on anything, I get bored.

08:28.880 --> 08:31.451
In eight minutes, I could be bored with you.
Unless you keep me interested.

08:32.840 --> 08:34.251
I think you can,

08:34.320 --> 08:35.684
and I think this
is the place for you

08:35.760 --> 08:37.922
to keep the rest of
the world interested, too.

08:38.320 --> 08:40.129
It's your call.
I won't chase you.

08:40.200 --> 08:41.565
I'm definitely tempted...

08:42.000 --> 08:43.967
Take as long as you
want to look around.

08:44.039 --> 08:47.010
Email me your figure. I'll
call you back with a counter.

08:51.640 --> 08:55.964
This is our top priority. Ohio,
Florida and Pennsylvania.

08:56.720 --> 08:59.041
We need all of them or
Walker's a one-term president.

08:59.120 --> 09:01.726
Pennsylvania is why he picked
Matthews as a running mate.

09:01.800 --> 09:03.643
But now we have to
find a replacement.

09:03.760 --> 09:05.569
The special election
is this November.

09:06.120 --> 09:08.282
Patricia Whittaker.
DNC chair.

09:08.440 --> 09:10.886
A rare example of someone
whose head is in the game

09:10.960 --> 09:12.769
instead of
up their backside.

09:12.840 --> 09:15.127
Competence is such an
exotic bird in these woods

09:15.280 --> 09:17.567
that I appreciate
it whenever I see it.

09:17.640 --> 09:19.722
Now, this also
affects the House.

09:19.800 --> 09:21.484
The new Governor will
oversee redistricting.

09:21.560 --> 09:22.766
We lose seats here,

09:22.840 --> 09:24.330
that means we could lose
our majority in Washington.

09:24.640 --> 09:27.610
Well, the RNC is backing Jack
Swofford, ex-mayor of Pittsburgh.

09:27.680 --> 09:29.808
He's got state-wide
name recognition

09:29.920 --> 09:31.251
and campaign machinery
in place...

09:31.320 --> 09:34.403
It's been three months
and we don't have dick.

09:34.480 --> 09:36.289
What about the A.G.?
Ben Pluckett?

09:36.400 --> 09:38.846
No, Ben's got his eyes
set on the Senate in '14.

09:38.920 --> 09:42.049
Yeah, which he'll lose because he
botched a sex offender sting last year.

09:42.120 --> 09:44.521
Well, there's always McHolland.
He's 78.

09:44.600 --> 09:46.841
When's the last time he held office?
When Carter was president?

09:46.920 --> 09:48.843
Reagan,
but same difference.

09:48.920 --> 09:50.968
Well, he has dignity.
He has gravitas.

09:51.040 --> 09:52.610
I mean, if you need someone
to fill Matthews' shoes...

09:52.680 --> 09:55.411
You can't fill Jim Matthews' shoes.
So we shouldn't even try.

09:55.840 --> 09:57.410
We need a fresh face.

09:57.480 --> 09:59.005
The state has
a weak bench.

09:59.080 --> 10:01.367
Well, let's go through all the
sitting Congressmen one by one,

10:01.480 --> 10:02.811
and see if anybody
sticks out from the crowd.

10:02.920 --> 10:05.764
- All right. I got the list right here
- Okay. Go ahead.

10:05.840 --> 10:08.491
Pennsylvania's first
district, Peter Russo.

10:08.560 --> 10:11.404
Cross him off. He's no good.
No experience. No chops.

10:11.480 --> 10:14.450
Okay, moving on. Second
district, Gwendolyn Pierce.

10:14.520 --> 10:17.490
Gwen's too controversial.
Very vocal on abortion...

10:17.560 --> 10:18.561
And, Caroline?

10:18.720 --> 10:19.767
She's good.

10:19.880 --> 10:20.881
Yeah? How're the boys?

10:21.040 --> 10:22.041
All fuckin'
four of them?

10:22.120 --> 10:23.884
You feed 'em.

10:23.960 --> 10:26.281
You got any pictures?
On your phone?

10:26.360 --> 10:28.488
Come on. Let's cut the
shit, Pete, will ya?

10:28.600 --> 10:30.728
What are we gonna do
about the shipyard?

10:34.040 --> 10:37.044
BRAC had their hearing.
They slated it for closing.

10:37.120 --> 10:39.327
Yeah, and why
didn't you testify?

10:39.440 --> 10:41.647
We're talking
12,000 jobs here.

10:41.720 --> 10:44.291
My hands were tied, Paul.
People wanted it closed.

10:44.400 --> 10:46.164
I was under a lot of pressure.
From who?

10:47.120 --> 10:49.248
People high up the food chain.
There's nothing I could do.

10:49.680 --> 10:52.968
That's bullshit. You go back to BRAC.
You talk to the DOD.

10:53.040 --> 10:55.407
You talk to the Secretary of the Navy.
You do something...

10:55.480 --> 10:56.481
It's not gonna happen.

10:56.600 --> 10:57.647
Okay, why not?

10:58.000 --> 10:59.365
I told you,
it's political.

10:59.440 --> 11:01.488
Okay, so I'm supposed to go back
to the Shipbuilder's Association

11:01.560 --> 11:02.846
and say what now, exactly?

11:03.200 --> 11:05.851
That they're out of work because
Pete Russo's playing politics?

11:08.160 --> 11:09.400
I mean, Jesus, Pete.

11:09.840 --> 11:12.605
We're the ones who got you fuckin'
elected in the first place.

11:13.720 --> 11:16.121
Now you're gonna
turn your back on us?

11:16.200 --> 11:18.009
You should go.

11:20.080 --> 11:21.320
Seriously?

11:23.680 --> 11:25.728
I just got here.
You're kickin' me out now?

11:26.880 --> 11:29.611
Hey, I'm fuckin'
talkin' to you.

11:32.040 --> 11:33.769
I thought we
grew up together.

11:33.880 --> 11:37.441
But this guy, sitting
behind his big desk,

11:38.160 --> 11:41.130
I don't even know
who the fuck he is.

11:42.400 --> 11:44.084
Where's the Pete Russo who
knew how to throw a punch

11:44.160 --> 11:46.686
when his back was
against the wall?

11:46.880 --> 11:48.848
That guy was my friend.

12:01.520 --> 12:03.568
Every teacher in the country?
A month before school ends?

12:03.640 --> 12:04.687
He doesn't need
all of them.

12:04.760 --> 12:06.762
Fifteen, 20 states.
That's all.

12:06.840 --> 12:08.888
But the AFT and the NEA
can't agree on anything.

12:08.960 --> 12:11.008
You underestimate
Marty Spinella.

12:12.800 --> 12:14.165
So which one
do we target?

12:15.880 --> 12:17.120
We have a better
chance with the NEA.

12:17.880 --> 12:19.325
You think Chuck Sloan
will bite?

12:19.400 --> 12:22.563
Cooperate, we give your people
protection and a place at the banquet.

12:22.640 --> 12:24.369
Fight us, we break you.

12:24.480 --> 12:26.084
He'll bite.
Get him on the phone.

12:26.160 --> 12:27.207
It's after 2:00.

12:27.960 --> 12:30.611
Spinella's potentially mobilizing
the largest teachers' strike

12:30.680 --> 12:32.967
in United States history.
Nobody's sleeping.

12:33.040 --> 12:35.008
I'll call him right now.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.764
I'm sorry.
Are we being too loud?

12:37.840 --> 12:39.205
A little.

12:41.920 --> 12:42.967
What are you working on?

12:43.040 --> 12:45.202
The gala.
There's so much to do.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.047
Did Nancy
send you my list?

12:48.200 --> 12:49.281
She did.

12:49.360 --> 12:51.124
And what'd you think?

12:51.480 --> 12:54.404
It's a good list.
Thanks for inviting them.

12:57.200 --> 12:58.690
Is something wrong?

13:01.120 --> 13:03.851
It's still not anywhere near
what Remy brought to the table.

13:05.400 --> 13:07.641
SanCorp offered
1.5 million, Francis.

13:07.720 --> 13:11.281
I'm adding up the numbers and
we're only at half a million.

13:11.360 --> 13:13.488
I got Chuck on the phone.
In a minute.

13:13.560 --> 13:14.607
I can make
more calls...

13:14.680 --> 13:16.045
Enough to raise
1.5 million?

13:16.640 --> 13:18.210
Well, I can at least
get us closer.

13:20.840 --> 13:22.046
I'm going to bed.

13:23.840 --> 13:25.444
Don't move
any of this around.

13:25.520 --> 13:29.684
Claire... We made the
decision to turn Remy down.

13:30.280 --> 13:32.681
No one forced you. I thought
we were okay on this.

13:32.760 --> 13:33.761
You're right.

13:36.160 --> 13:37.685
Good night, Francis.

14:22.680 --> 14:24.842
<i>This is Adam.
Leave a message.</i>

14:24.920 --> 14:27.400
Hi, Adam, it's me.
I know it's late, but...

14:29.960 --> 14:33.726
Well, I was really just calling to
thank you again for the photographs.

14:33.800 --> 14:37.202
I'm sure they're gonna be
a big hit at the auction.

14:38.560 --> 14:40.164
Hope you're well.

14:44.560 --> 14:48.042
<i>I'm sure they're gonna be
a big hit at the auction.</i>

14:49.280 --> 14:51.169
<i>Hope you're well.</i>

15:08.920 --> 15:11.321
Right this way,
Mr. Hammerschmidt.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.081
He's here.

15:19.040 --> 15:20.849
Good afternoon, Tom.

15:26.520 --> 15:27.681
Legal?

15:28.200 --> 15:30.441
Did you say it
or didn't you?

15:32.680 --> 15:35.763
To you and to
anyone who asks...

15:35.840 --> 15:37.046
Yes, I did.

15:39.520 --> 15:41.010
Do we really
need them?

15:41.080 --> 15:42.650
Not unless I should
expect a fight.

15:42.720 --> 15:43.721
You shouldn't.

15:45.120 --> 15:47.009
Give us a few moments.

15:59.200 --> 16:01.248
It's not what
you called her.

16:01.320 --> 16:02.810
It's that you let her
leave the building.

16:03.160 --> 16:05.686
I know how to run
a paper, Margaret.

16:05.760 --> 16:07.569
What I don't know how
to do is run a paper

16:07.720 --> 16:09.529
staffed with people
I can't control.

16:09.600 --> 16:11.728
Was she really
out of control?

16:12.080 --> 16:15.084
To my understanding, she simply
turned down a new position.

16:15.200 --> 16:17.680
It's her attitude. It's the
way she turned it down.

16:17.760 --> 16:20.286
Did you think to ask her what
she'd rather do instead?

16:20.360 --> 16:22.124
Is it my job to pander
to all my employees' wants...

16:22.200 --> 16:23.326
MY employees.

16:25.680 --> 16:28.001
And if they have something
to offer that you don't,

16:28.080 --> 16:29.445
yes, it is your job.

16:29.520 --> 16:31.602
We've been
through this, Tom.

16:31.680 --> 16:34.524
The paper's operating at a loss.
We need people like Zoe...

16:35.080 --> 16:38.289
I'm very aware of how much
we're hurting, Margaret.

16:38.640 --> 16:40.688
Staff reductions,
dip in circulation,

16:40.760 --> 16:44.003
each one of those faces
and every subscriber we lose,

16:44.080 --> 16:45.525
they keep me
awake at night.

16:45.600 --> 16:48.763
Now I... I won't argue
the business side of things.

16:48.840 --> 16:51.286
It's neither my place
nor my area of expertise.

16:51.360 --> 16:52.805
But know this,

16:53.920 --> 16:57.641
Zoe Barnes,
Twitter, blogs,

16:58.280 --> 17:01.648
enriched media,
they're all surface.

17:02.920 --> 17:04.410
They're fads.

17:04.800 --> 17:06.962
They aren't the foundation
this paper was built on,

17:07.119 --> 17:10.010
and they aren't
what will keep it alive.

17:10.079 --> 17:14.005
We have a core readership
that thirsts for hard news.

17:14.640 --> 17:18.361
Those are the people I work
80 hours a week for.

17:20.760 --> 17:23.730
And I won't be distracted
by what's fashionable.

17:32.840 --> 17:34.569
That's your
resignation letter.

17:34.640 --> 17:37.484
Hand it to the lawyers
on the way out.

17:38.280 --> 17:40.362
I'll give you
some privacy.

17:42.440 --> 17:44.681
No, no, stay,
it'll be quick.

17:46.040 --> 17:47.690
We'll get a drink.

17:51.520 --> 17:53.488
We're gonna launch
right here in Washington.

17:53.560 --> 17:55.050
We'll see how
Congress likes it

17:55.120 --> 17:57.964
when the streets are teeming
with unsupervised school kids.

17:58.440 --> 18:00.488
Then we'll phase out
the rest of the country.

18:00.600 --> 18:02.841
Everybody, hold on for one minute.
What's up?

18:03.480 --> 18:04.527
The NEA is out.

18:04.680 --> 18:05.727
What?

18:05.960 --> 18:07.962
They pulled out.
Why?

18:08.040 --> 18:09.166
He wouldn't say.

18:11.280 --> 18:13.009
Hold on for
one more minute.

18:13.080 --> 18:14.684
Chuck Sloan? Get him on
the phone right now.

18:14.800 --> 18:15.926
I've got him right here.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.843
Is he muted?
Yes.

18:22.960 --> 18:24.485
Hey, Chuck, it's Marty.

18:24.560 --> 18:26.801
Listen, you can't do this.

18:27.840 --> 18:31.083
If we don't stay united now,
we don't have a...

18:31.200 --> 18:33.567
You hired me to represent
your interests, right?

18:33.640 --> 18:35.404
How could I possibly
lobby for the teachers

18:35.480 --> 18:37.050
when Congress
sees us splintering

18:37.120 --> 18:39.168
before we even
put up a unite...

18:40.800 --> 18:41.801
All right.

18:43.280 --> 18:45.009
Did Underwood
get to you?

18:45.720 --> 18:47.961
Frank is dishonest
and manipulative.

18:48.040 --> 18:49.929
You've seen that
he's lied to us already.

18:50.000 --> 18:53.004
Wait, Chuck?
Chuck, Chuck? Chuck!

18:55.200 --> 18:56.406
Son of a bitch!

18:59.320 --> 19:01.004
- Where are you?
- I'm at the office.

19:01.080 --> 19:02.570
<i>False.
You don't believe me?</i>

19:02.640 --> 19:03.801
Not for a second.

19:03.880 --> 19:04.961
<i>Where are you?</i>

19:05.080 --> 19:06.081
About to walk
into a meeting.

19:06.240 --> 19:07.287
<i>With who?</i>

19:07.360 --> 19:08.600
Someone I have to punish.

19:08.680 --> 19:09.841
<i>Give me a name.</i>

19:09.960 --> 19:11.166
No names.

19:11.240 --> 19:12.890
<i>What did this
person do wrong?</i>

19:12.960 --> 19:14.405
Lie to me.

19:14.480 --> 19:16.562
<i>How will you
punish him?</i>

19:16.720 --> 19:19.291
What makes you think it's a him?

19:20.920 --> 19:22.843
Hold on.
I have to take this.

19:24.680 --> 19:25.920
Where are you?

19:26.040 --> 19:27.280
Me? lam...

19:27.360 --> 19:29.681
Not at the office.

19:33.320 --> 19:36.767
You're gonna give me a new
one of these every week?

19:37.000 --> 19:39.446
Well, I can't
continue to...

19:40.600 --> 19:41.601
Not without protection.

19:41.720 --> 19:44.564
Nobody tells me when
to work and when to play.

19:44.640 --> 19:46.642
I'm not being
unreasonable, Zoe.

19:46.720 --> 19:48.927
If you can't trust me, we
shouldn't be doing this at all.

19:54.480 --> 19:56.926
Well, then how do we
establish our trust?

19:57.000 --> 19:58.684
I have been very discreet.

19:58.800 --> 20:00.723
Professional
discretion, yes.

20:00.800 --> 20:04.122
But this is
new territory.

20:08.240 --> 20:10.368
You have a camera
on your phone.

20:17.680 --> 20:18.727
Pictures.

20:20.320 --> 20:23.403
The kind I wouldn't
want my father to see.

20:27.320 --> 20:30.164
Well, I'm gonna
need more than that.

20:54.760 --> 20:55.761
Lie back.

21:03.920 --> 21:05.763
Use your imagination.

21:12.360 --> 21:13.850
I want everything
packed for tomorrow.

21:14.360 --> 21:15.521
We checked already, Dad.

21:16.200 --> 21:19.443
Did you? Those are my pink
Nikes on the kitchen counter?

21:19.520 --> 21:22.251
And you, Autobot, what is Optimus
Prime doing under my bed?

21:22.320 --> 21:25.210
He better transform himself
into your backpack

21:25.280 --> 21:28.045
before you have
to leave tomorrow.

21:29.720 --> 21:32.803
Hey, Dad,
is Christina coming back?

21:34.200 --> 21:36.885
I don't... I don't
think so, buddy.No.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.001
Oh.

21:38.240 --> 21:39.446
I liked her.

21:39.520 --> 21:40.646
Me, too.
She's cool.

21:41.440 --> 21:43.329
Yeah, she is cool.

21:44.360 --> 21:46.522
Now, you guys
gotta brush your teeth.

21:46.640 --> 21:48.802
And then check
the rooms again.

21:48.880 --> 21:50.769
And then it's
time for bed.

21:50.840 --> 21:51.966
Got it, pumpkins?

21:52.080 --> 21:55.163
Dad, you know I hate it
when you call us pumpkins.

21:55.760 --> 21:58.969
Go. Before I turn you
into a pie.

22:10.680 --> 22:11.681
Peter Russo.

22:15.560 --> 22:17.289
He's a drunk.
He is at the moment.

22:17.360 --> 22:20.330
A very functional one.
Imagine if he was sober.

22:20.600 --> 22:22.090
Even so,
you run him for Governor,

22:22.200 --> 22:23.725
people are going
to dig into his past.

22:23.880 --> 22:26.486
Well, we turn that into an
asset, not a liability.

22:26.560 --> 22:29.564
Here's who I was,
here's who I am now.

22:29.640 --> 22:32.530
You saw how they dismissed him in three
seconds at the Leadership meeting.

22:32.600 --> 22:36.571
Patti Whittaker is very open-minded.
And I am very persuasive.

22:39.920 --> 22:41.081
You think Russo
even wants it?

22:41.160 --> 22:43.288
Any kid who's made it from
the streets of South Philly

22:43.360 --> 22:45.601
to the Capitol
rotunda is ambitious.

22:45.680 --> 22:47.364
We just need
to tap into that.

22:47.440 --> 22:49.886
Surround him with the best people
and then build the machine

22:49.960 --> 22:51.200
and push the "go" button.

22:51.720 --> 22:52.881
So you think
he could win.

22:54.160 --> 22:56.606
I think he can be
a contender.

22:58.360 --> 23:01.728
Okay, let's say we pull off
a miracle and he wins.

23:01.800 --> 23:02.801
What do we gain by it?

23:03.000 --> 23:05.048
Isn't it better to be holding
the reins in this race

23:05.120 --> 23:07.168
than watching
from the stands?

23:07.280 --> 23:08.406
Your wife
is on the phone.

23:08.520 --> 23:09.646
Put her through
in here.

23:09.720 --> 23:10.721
I understand
that Pennsylvania's

23:10.840 --> 23:11.887
important for
re-districting...

23:11.960 --> 23:14.884
No, no,no, this isn't just
about this race, Doug.

23:14.960 --> 23:18.806
Expand your thinking. Who
else is from Pennsylvania?

23:21.280 --> 23:22.930
No, no,no,
not in Congress.

23:23.800 --> 23:25.211
The executive branch.

23:27.040 --> 23:28.326
The Vice President.

23:30.040 --> 23:31.201
Hello, my dear.

23:31.280 --> 23:34.284
Nancy had my tux dry-cleaned
so I won't embarrass...

23:34.360 --> 23:35.691
<i>The Cotesworth canceled on us.</i>

23:38.040 --> 23:40.611
I'm leaving right now. I'll come get you.
I've gotta go.

23:40.680 --> 23:41.647
What's going on?

23:41.720 --> 23:43.484
The hotel,
for tonight's gala,

23:43.560 --> 23:46.370
they refuse to let
Claire into the ballroom

23:46.520 --> 23:49.330
because their
employees are union.

23:49.440 --> 23:50.441
Spinella.

23:50.520 --> 23:53.330
Yeah, he can go after me all he wants.
But to go after my wife?

23:54.000 --> 23:55.126
No class.

23:55.200 --> 23:56.281
Meet me
at the Cotesworth.

23:56.400 --> 23:57.526
You got it.

23:59.800 --> 24:01.723
Why can't we just move
it to another place?

24:01.800 --> 24:03.086
I looked into that.
Everything's booked.

24:03.160 --> 24:05.128
You have to reserve these
things weeks in advance.

24:05.200 --> 24:07.521
I got Stamper online looking
for another venue somewhere.

24:07.600 --> 24:09.921
Francis, the delivery trucks
are already at the Cotesworth.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.367
I can't have people showing up
at a different place

24:12.440 --> 24:13.726
in case they
don't get the email.

24:13.800 --> 24:15.370
All right. This is my fault.
I feel awful.

24:15.440 --> 24:17.010
There's a half a million
on the line here.

24:17.080 --> 24:18.730
I realize that.

24:18.800 --> 24:20.290
And I can't keep
having my work

24:20.400 --> 24:21.925
take these hits
on behalf of yours.

24:22.000 --> 24:23.650
It's more than
just an inconvenience.

24:23.720 --> 24:25.643
I know.
We'll solve it.

24:32.920 --> 24:34.490
Hey, I just got
your email.

24:34.560 --> 24:35.641
What'd you think?

24:35.720 --> 24:38.121
You don't have to send me
things before you post.

24:38.760 --> 24:40.250
I thought you might
want to take a look.

24:40.320 --> 24:41.606
The goal here
is for everyone

24:41.680 --> 24:43.330
to post things faster than I
have a chance to read 'em.

24:43.440 --> 24:46.011
If you're satisfied with the
article, you just put it up.

24:46.080 --> 24:47.081
Okay.

24:47.320 --> 24:48.401
Are you satisfied?

24:48.560 --> 24:49.641
I think so.

24:50.640 --> 24:51.846
Okay, you are
or you aren't.

24:51.920 --> 24:53.763
Whatever hoops The Herald
made you jump through...

24:53.840 --> 24:55.922
I know.
Let them go.

24:56.080 --> 24:58.208
It's okay
to be opinionated, Zoe.

24:58.280 --> 25:00.601
And it's okay to go outside
and get your hands dirty.

25:01.280 --> 25:03.931
You're no longer
tied to a desk.

25:04.040 --> 25:05.929
Or to that pillow for that matter.
I'm not gonna post it.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.480
Midterm predictions, they're not news.
They're bullshit.

25:09.080 --> 25:10.491
Well, I agree.

25:12.000 --> 25:13.161
I can do better.

25:13.280 --> 25:14.611
I think you can.

25:15.280 --> 25:17.567
Feel free to blow my mind.

25:26.480 --> 25:28.960
If we do this event,
the whole staff walks out.

25:29.040 --> 25:30.963
I've got 300 guests...

25:31.080 --> 25:32.969
You signed a contract
with my wife.

25:33.160 --> 25:34.491
We'll refund your
wife's organization

25:34.600 --> 25:36.762
and pay for whatever the
cost of moving the event

25:36.840 --> 25:38.365
to a more
appropriate venue.

25:38.440 --> 25:41.205
And we would have to refund half
a million dollars in donations.

25:41.280 --> 25:42.611
Can you pay
for that, too?

25:42.680 --> 25:44.284
'Cause I'm pretty sure there's
cause for damages here.

25:44.400 --> 25:47.290
I truly apologize, sir.

25:47.520 --> 25:48.726
Who's your boss?

25:48.800 --> 25:49.881
I spoke with
the owners,

25:49.960 --> 25:52.008
and they authorized me
to do what I think is best.

25:52.080 --> 25:54.128
And do they realize that
they are shutting the door

25:54.240 --> 25:56.686
on 41 members of
the United States Congress?

25:57.360 --> 25:58.930
Yes, sir. They do.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.321
I had to make a very
hard judgment call.

26:01.400 --> 26:03.801
Well, I seriously
question your judgment.

26:03.880 --> 26:05.803
You know, word travels
fast in this town.

26:06.360 --> 26:08.727
All those luncheons
and conventions and dinners,

26:08.800 --> 26:11.007
it's gonna be a shame to lose
all that work, isn't it?

26:11.120 --> 26:13.009
Congressman,
you are absolutely right,

26:13.120 --> 26:15.009
but if my staff
walks out, I...

26:15.600 --> 26:18.410
Please understand
the predicament I'm in.

26:18.480 --> 26:19.527
<i>I got an idea.</i>

26:19.920 --> 26:21.206
I know what
we're gonna do.

26:21.280 --> 26:24.250
Honey, they're not gonna
let us have it inside,

26:24.320 --> 26:25.526
we're gonna
have it right here,

26:25.600 --> 26:27.045
on their front steps.
Picnic style.

26:27.120 --> 26:28.167
What do you
need from me?

26:28.280 --> 26:29.327
I need your manpower.

26:29.440 --> 26:30.930
Yes, sir, I'm on it.

26:34.200 --> 26:37.682
Okay, everybody, stop what
you're doing and listen up.

26:40.360 --> 26:41.521
Yeah?

26:42.920 --> 26:44.126
Hey, Frank.

26:44.200 --> 26:45.440
<i>FRANCIS: Listen,
I need a favor, a large one.</i>

26:46.640 --> 26:47.971
How soon?

26:48.040 --> 26:49.246
<i>In about three hours.</i>

26:50.040 --> 26:51.883
How many people we talking?
Just 300.

26:51.960 --> 26:53.883
The florist is gonna send
over whatever he has.

26:53.960 --> 26:55.200
Great.

26:55.320 --> 26:56.560
Francis,
where are we with food?

26:56.680 --> 26:58.523
I've got hot dogs, pizzas,
and soul food coming.

26:58.600 --> 27:00.045
Maybe something else.

27:00.120 --> 27:01.724
Girls.
Here's what I want.

27:01.800 --> 27:05.407
I want four bars, two on each level.
The food can go there.

27:05.480 --> 27:07.084
The silent auction
goes here.

27:07.160 --> 27:09.083
And cancel the string quartet.
Let's get a DJ.

27:09.160 --> 27:10.525
Doug, how are we on booze?

27:10.640 --> 27:11.766
Kegs are on their way now.
Great.

27:11.840 --> 27:13.205
And call Denise
at the office

27:13.280 --> 27:16.204
and have her bring every
donation envelope she can find.

27:16.320 --> 27:18.322
Okay, messages, people.

27:22.880 --> 27:26.965
Congressman Russo's office. Yes, can
you hold one minute? Thank you.

27:27.080 --> 27:29.481
Congressman? People keep
calling about the shipyards.

27:29.560 --> 27:30.561
We don't know
what to tell them.

27:30.640 --> 27:31.641
We just say we'll
give you the message.

27:31.720 --> 27:33.245
Keep saying that.
Okay, here they are.

27:33.320 --> 27:34.845
The messages and all the
emails we've gotten to.

27:34.920 --> 27:37.651
Do you want me to...
Have a good night.

27:40.440 --> 27:41.680
Who'd we reach?

27:41.760 --> 27:43.808
<i>Herald, The Times,
USA Today.</i>

27:43.920 --> 27:45.843
All right, I want affiliate
stations and cable news.

27:45.920 --> 27:48.241
I want satellite trucks out there.
I want this on live TV.

27:48.320 --> 27:49.481
Okay, I'm on it.

27:50.080 --> 27:51.491
You can't
do this here.

27:51.560 --> 27:54.643
Zoe, 8:00 p.m. tonight,
Hotel Cotesworth.

27:54.960 --> 27:57.201
Benefit for
my wife's charity.

27:57.320 --> 28:00.449
No. Wash your face
and let your hair down.

28:01.000 --> 28:03.048
This is
work and play.

28:03.280 --> 28:04.281
See you.

28:04.440 --> 28:07.603
I can tell you right now
I'm gonna need two dozen.

28:13.160 --> 28:14.924
Paul, I'm gonna need those
by tomorrow, okay?

28:15.000 --> 28:17.401
Your guests are
your problem, not mine.

28:17.480 --> 28:18.686
Julian.

28:18.840 --> 28:20.080
I'll close the gate.

28:21.000 --> 28:22.365
You know, I'm no
expert in fire code,

28:22.440 --> 28:24.568
but I would imagine
that locking your guests in

28:24.720 --> 28:26.529
is a bigger violation than
having them walk around us.

28:26.640 --> 28:30.406
This is trespassing on private property.
You're breaking the law.

28:30.520 --> 28:31.567
All right. Okay.

28:33.120 --> 28:35.202
Let me get Barney Hull
on the phone here for you.

28:38.200 --> 28:40.362
Here you go.
It's ringing.

28:41.120 --> 28:42.963
Who's Barney Hull?
Police Commissioner.

28:43.080 --> 28:45.731
<i>Commissioner Hull's office.
Hello? No? Okay.</i>

28:45.800 --> 28:47.404
You'd rather talk to him in person?

28:47.480 --> 28:48.720
That's great.
He's coming to the party.

28:49.280 --> 28:51.089
I'll be sure to introduce
the two of you.

28:51.160 --> 28:53.766
Thanks for
your hospitality.

29:04.400 --> 29:07.483
What do you want me to do?
I can't lock the gates.

29:07.560 --> 29:09.085
And they've got
the police on their side.

29:09.160 --> 29:11.128
Unbelievable.
Hold on.

29:11.840 --> 29:15.606
Cassandra. I need 200 teachers
at the Cotesworth Hotel.

29:15.680 --> 29:16.727
Right now.

29:16.800 --> 29:17.801
I need a full picket.

29:17.920 --> 29:18.887
Two hundred?
I don't know if we can

29:19.000 --> 29:21.002
get that many on... I don't want to hear it.
Just get it done.

29:21.080 --> 29:23.287
All right. I don't give a fuck if
they're teachers or not, frankly.

29:23.360 --> 29:24.521
Just get me 200 bodies.

29:24.600 --> 29:26.409
Call the Teamsters,
maybe they'll help us.

29:26.480 --> 29:29.563
We'll give them glasses if we have to.
Tell the guys to look smart.

29:29.720 --> 29:33.441
Charlie, get off the phone. I need
signs right now, at least 100.

29:33.840 --> 29:35.285
<i>You know what?
Let them set it up.</i>

29:35.360 --> 29:36.850
<i>It's actually better
for us that way. They...</i>

29:37.040 --> 29:38.485
<i>This way they
can't hide from us.</i>

29:38.560 --> 29:41.530
You've put me in
a terrible situation.

29:59.280 --> 30:01.248
Thank you very much
for all your help.

30:01.360 --> 30:02.930
Much appreciated.

30:03.400 --> 30:05.971
Here, we've got the signs right here.
Let's hand them out fast.

30:06.040 --> 30:11.046
Everybody, single file, right down the
street, this way and that way, okay?

30:19.560 --> 30:22.484
Well, at least
he spelled it right.

30:22.560 --> 30:25.848
<i>REPORTING: Teachers protesting the
Education Reform and Achievement Act</i>

30:25.920 --> 30:29.447
<i>have descended upon the Hotel
Cotesworth in Washington, D. C.</i>

30:31.040 --> 30:33.771
<i>Union lobbyist, Marty Spine/Ia,
organized the demonstration.</i>

30:33.840 --> 30:36.002
Teachers deserve respect!

30:36.080 --> 30:37.605
Teachers deserve respect!

30:44.600 --> 30:47.729
Now, I knew you'd show up and you'd
bring that beautiful wife of yours.

30:47.800 --> 30:49.882
Hello, it's a pleasure,
thank you for coming.

30:49.960 --> 30:51.530
Come on in,
the drinks are on the house.

30:51.600 --> 30:52.761
Felicity.

30:52.920 --> 30:54.126
The party can begin.

30:54.560 --> 30:56.130
This is Spinella.

30:56.200 --> 30:57.884
He got us shut out
by the union,

30:58.000 --> 31:00.048
so we had to have a party
out here on the steps.

31:00.120 --> 31:01.884
I'm gonna take you
up to a bar right now.

31:01.960 --> 31:04.440
Thank you for coming.
Thank you. Welcome.

31:05.480 --> 31:07.482
Teachers, yes! Unions, yes!

31:52.000 --> 31:53.001
Hi.

32:02.520 --> 32:04.170
Thanks, again,
so much for coming.

32:08.680 --> 32:10.091
Adam's here.

32:13.880 --> 32:15.120
You came.

32:18.360 --> 32:19.725
Looks wonderful.

32:19.800 --> 32:21.211
You're gonna have
to move over

32:21.280 --> 32:24.409
because I have to serve
this wonderful couple myself.

32:24.480 --> 32:27.768
This is fabulous. Only Claire
could have thought of this.

32:27.880 --> 32:31.521
I don't suppose you have
anything single-malt back there?

32:31.640 --> 32:35.361
Frank, it's worth every penny
to see you on keg duty.

32:35.440 --> 32:38.842
Well then, don't you think that this
is worth just a few extra pennies?

32:38.920 --> 32:40.729
Let's break out
the checkbook, Charles.

32:42.160 --> 32:43.605
Did you RSVP?

32:43.680 --> 32:45.728
I assumed
it didn't matter.

32:45.800 --> 32:47.006
It doesn't.

32:47.080 --> 32:48.923
I'm glad you're here.

32:49.720 --> 32:50.960
When I heard
your message...

32:51.040 --> 32:54.806
You know, I shouldn't
have left that, Adam.

32:54.880 --> 32:56.086
Why not?

32:59.800 --> 33:01.643
Maybe we should
talk at some point.

33:02.160 --> 33:05.289
Make that check with a
lot of zeros, won't you?

33:05.920 --> 33:07.365
Here we are.

33:13.560 --> 33:15.005
Cheers.
Cheers.

33:15.080 --> 33:16.366
Cheers.

33:16.440 --> 33:19.091
Now I'm going to ask a huge
favor of you since you're here.

33:19.960 --> 33:21.291
You want to
put me to work.

33:21.400 --> 33:22.765
Yes, please.

33:22.880 --> 33:24.848
My pleasure.
Come.

33:27.080 --> 33:30.527
So these are some wonderful photographs
by an amazing photographer...

33:30.600 --> 33:31.931
Gillian...

33:32.040 --> 33:33.690
Adam Galloway.
Nice to meet you.

33:33.800 --> 33:35.404
I've heard lots about you.
And to you.

33:35.520 --> 33:37.807
And this is the photographer himself.
Hello, how are you?

33:40.120 --> 33:41.804
Freddy.

33:43.720 --> 33:47.520
I just wanted to thank you so much.
Such a success tonight.

33:47.600 --> 33:48.761
My pleasure, my pleasure.

33:48.960 --> 33:50.121
He's the best.

33:50.200 --> 33:51.611
I see Adam's here.

33:51.720 --> 33:53.165
I didn't know
he was coming.

33:53.240 --> 33:56.210
Well, guess what I got. Another
check from the Holburns.

33:56.280 --> 33:58.442
For $60,000.

34:02.320 --> 34:05.130
Come on, praise me
like you should.

34:06.160 --> 34:07.571
If Frank Underwood and the
United States Congress...

34:07.640 --> 34:09.005
Hi, my name is Zoe Barnes.
I'm with Slugline.

34:09.080 --> 34:12.129
...think that they can dismantle the
rights of the American teacher,

34:12.199 --> 34:14.965
well, then they are going to hear
our voices wherever they are.

34:15.040 --> 34:17.850
Hi, why protest here?

34:18.440 --> 34:20.010
Congress has to
take this seriously.

34:20.639 --> 34:23.449
We're here for the teachers.
We're here...

34:23.560 --> 34:25.005
Thank you.
Thank you.

34:26.760 --> 34:28.091
We're not asking
for the world.

34:28.159 --> 34:30.208
And Congress needs to step
up and get this done.

34:43.920 --> 34:44.920
Excuse me,
just a moment.

34:47.360 --> 34:49.931
Well, that dress
looks familiar.

34:50.000 --> 34:51.922
It's the one I wore
to the symphony.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.446
Yes, the mutual
admiration society.

34:54.520 --> 34:56.010
That's right.

34:56.199 --> 34:58.567
So. What do you
have for me?

34:59.040 --> 35:00.166
What do you mean?

35:00.240 --> 35:02.208
Well, you're surrounded
by Washington's elite.

35:02.280 --> 35:03.770
Are you saying
you've overheard nothing

35:03.880 --> 35:05.450
that could be useful
to either of us?

35:05.520 --> 35:06.760
I'm covering
the protest.

35:06.840 --> 35:08.808
The rest of the world
is covering the protest.

35:08.880 --> 35:10.086
You may not have noticed,

35:10.160 --> 35:12.606
but you're the only journalist
inside the party.

35:12.680 --> 35:13.841
I've been
feeding you plenty,

35:13.920 --> 35:16.207
information is a two-way
street, Ms. Barnes.

35:16.400 --> 35:17.640
Hello...

35:17.760 --> 35:19.762
Claire, this is Zoe Barnes, you
met her one night at the house...

35:19.840 --> 35:23.242
Yes, I remember. You work
for The Herald, right?

35:23.520 --> 35:26.410
<i>Not anymore. I actually
work at Slugline now.</i>

35:26.520 --> 35:29.000
I've heard of it. You read
it, don't you, Francis?

35:29.080 --> 35:30.286
Religiously.

35:30.920 --> 35:34.527
Well, you seem like a very ambitious
young woman. I like that.

35:34.800 --> 35:36.325
Doing my best.

35:36.400 --> 35:38.402
It's good
to see you, again.

35:38.920 --> 35:39.967
Please,
enjoy yourself.

35:40.080 --> 35:41.127
I will. Thank you.

35:41.240 --> 35:43.242
Take care,
Ms. Barnes.

38:13.200 --> 38:15.089
And she looks gorgeous,

38:15.200 --> 38:18.886
but really she's thinking,
"When can I go the fuck home?"

38:23.080 --> 38:25.003
I'm off.
Already?

38:25.240 --> 38:27.129
I've done my duty,
I believe.

38:27.960 --> 38:31.851
You know me. I always have to
be the first to leave a party.

38:31.920 --> 38:33.922
How much did you raise?

38:34.040 --> 38:36.725
$750,000.

38:36.840 --> 38:39.127
Eighty of that was your photographs.
Fantastic.

38:39.240 --> 38:42.084
Write a check for 250,
we'll break a million.

38:42.160 --> 38:43.446
Nice try.

38:46.760 --> 38:50.287
Thank you for coming.
And everything that you did.

38:56.440 --> 38:57.965
Call me sometime.

38:58.760 --> 39:00.410
I Will.

39:02.040 --> 39:03.166
Teachers should
be getting more!

39:03.240 --> 39:04.401
So what does
a Clean Water gala

39:04.520 --> 39:05.601
have to do with
teachers unions?

39:05.760 --> 39:09.560
Well, we have over 50 members of
Congress gathered in one place.

39:09.640 --> 39:11.529
But the fact that
these members of Congress

39:11.600 --> 39:14.410
are promoting pouring money
out of the country

39:14.480 --> 39:17.529
while neglecting their teachers
at home is precisely the problem.

39:17.600 --> 39:20.843
But this is private money,
not public tax dollars, so...

39:20.960 --> 39:22.564
But we're not
protesting the cause,

39:22.640 --> 39:26.167
we're protesting the Congressmen
and women themselves...

39:26.240 --> 39:27.685
Are these even
teachers picketing?

39:27.800 --> 39:29.723
Sure, some of them. And
some of them are people...

39:29.800 --> 39:31.325
Excuse me...

39:32.960 --> 39:35.691
Frank... What you... Don't take the food.
We'll feed you later.

39:35.800 --> 39:38.167
- Don't take this food.
- Marty, you know that old saying,

39:38.240 --> 39:39.765
"The most dangerous
spot in the world is

39:39.880 --> 39:41.370
"to come between
a Teamster and free food."

39:41.800 --> 39:44.121
Don't take the food,
we're feeding you later.

39:44.200 --> 39:46.487
I'll take it.
She'll take it.

39:47.320 --> 39:48.890
Who else is hungry?

39:49.240 --> 39:50.366
There you go.

39:50.720 --> 39:51.801
Pass it back.

39:52.240 --> 39:53.446
Plenty more coming, guys.

39:54.720 --> 39:56.643
I know you've all been
out here for hours.

39:56.720 --> 39:58.484
Thank you, Freddy!

39:58.560 --> 40:00.688
The best ribs in D.C.

40:03.320 --> 40:05.527
Marty, come on. You've said your
piece, you got on the news.

40:05.640 --> 40:06.687
Come and enjoy yourself.

40:06.840 --> 40:08.490
I respect you, Claire,
you know I can't do that.

40:08.560 --> 40:11.325
Doesn't matter what side you're
on, everybody's gotta eat.

40:11.400 --> 40:13.209
You can have a plate of ribs.
Yes, you can.

40:13.320 --> 40:14.651
Come on. Yes, you can. I can't.

40:14.760 --> 40:16.444
Thank you, Claire, but I cannot.
You can do it.

40:16.520 --> 40:18.045
Come on, Marty!
Come on.

40:18.160 --> 40:19.730
I can't. Thank you.
Thank you.

40:20.000 --> 40:21.923
Freddy's.
You should go to Freddy's.

40:30.880 --> 40:32.803
<i>REPORTER: Several dozen
union sympathizers,</i>

<i>The protest dissipated

40:45.400 --> 40:47.880
<i>FRANCIS: Doesn't matter what side
you're on, everybody's gotta eat.</i>

40:48.560 --> 40:49.561
Turn it off.

40:49.640 --> 40:51.529
<i>REPORTER: It's unclear
whether protest will continue.</i>

40:53.120 --> 40:54.360
What now?

41:01.320 --> 41:04.722
Call the union leadership
and the chapter presidents.

41:05.920 --> 41:07.524
See if they're ready
to the pull the trigger.

41:07.600 --> 41:10.410
If they are, we strike
at midnight tomorrow.

41:38.320 --> 41:40.607
You were extraordinary.

41:40.720 --> 41:42.165
Tomorrow, people
who weren't there

41:42.280 --> 41:43.770
are gonna lie
and say they were.

41:45.360 --> 41:46.361
What are you reading?

41:50.640 --> 41:52.130
She can write.

41:53.400 --> 41:54.606
She can.

41:57.000 --> 41:58.968
And you can
raise money.

41:59.960 --> 42:02.042
Always,
for a good cause.

42:03.280 --> 42:04.281
Thank you.

42:24.840 --> 42:26.808
Wait in the car, please.

42:27.680 --> 42:30.490
Hold on.
I know who that is.

42:36.800 --> 42:38.325
Hello, Peter.

42:43.360 --> 42:45.328
I am starving.
I forgot to eat.

42:45.920 --> 42:47.331
Would you like something,
Peter?

42:47.480 --> 42:48.845
No, thanks.

42:49.160 --> 42:50.127
You should eat.

42:50.200 --> 42:51.247
Don't fight. She'll win.

42:51.360 --> 42:52.407
I Will.

42:53.320 --> 42:54.651
Okay, yes.

42:55.440 --> 42:56.646
You want some coffee?

42:56.840 --> 42:58.080
Yes, thanks.

42:58.560 --> 43:00.562
Do you have any children?

43:02.080 --> 43:04.162
Two. A son and a daughter.

43:06.520 --> 43:07.521
Married?

43:08.320 --> 43:09.651
Divorced.

43:11.320 --> 43:13.004
What are their names,
your kids?

43:13.360 --> 43:17.331
There's Sarah. She's 11,
and Kevin is eight.

43:18.840 --> 43:19.841
Do you have any pictures?

43:25.360 --> 43:27.681
Fuck!
I lost my phone...

43:28.520 --> 43:30.761
Sorry, I should...
I gotta go...

43:30.840 --> 43:31.841
Peter, sit down.

43:31.960 --> 43:33.166
You're gonna
enjoy your sandwich,

43:33.240 --> 43:34.924
have some coffee
and stay the night.

43:39.000 --> 43:40.286
Milk and sugar?

43:42.160 --> 43:43.321
Black.

43:44.720 --> 43:45.721
Some fresh towels.

43:46.400 --> 43:48.164
There should be
soap and toothpaste,

43:48.280 --> 43:50.044
everything you
need in the bathroom.

43:50.240 --> 43:52.163
Thank you so much for doing this.

43:52.240 --> 43:53.890
It's nothing.
Sleep well.

44:03.320 --> 44:04.367
What's going on, Peter?

44:09.080 --> 44:10.525
Talk to me.

44:14.520 --> 44:16.921
You think fresh towels
changes anything?

44:22.160 --> 44:23.161
Changes what?

44:23.240 --> 44:24.241
The shipyard.

44:27.240 --> 44:31.086
If I was home and you pulled that
shit, I'd beat the fuck out of you.

44:32.320 --> 44:35.529
I would crack your skull
on the pavement.

44:36.000 --> 44:37.445
That's why I came
over here today.

44:37.520 --> 44:40.205
To fuck you up for
what you made me do.

44:41.280 --> 44:42.520
I don't care how nice
you're being to me.

44:42.600 --> 44:43.601
I don't give a shit.

44:44.080 --> 44:45.923
I'm gonna
wake up tomorrow,

44:47.760 --> 44:49.125
and all these people,

44:55.120 --> 44:56.610
all my friends,

44:58.800 --> 45:00.006
are still fucked.

45:01.800 --> 45:03.165
And I'm still fucked.

45:06.520 --> 45:08.522
You fucked all of us.

45:09.880 --> 45:12.201
But I'm gonna
get blamed for it.

45:13.520 --> 45:16.285
So, now I have to carry that
weight on my shoulders.

45:25.320 --> 45:27.129
You fucked me, Frank.

45:29.000 --> 45:31.162
I shouldn't have
let you do it, but I did...

45:50.440 --> 45:52.090
Are you done now?

45:55.320 --> 45:57.004
Get up.

46:01.040 --> 46:02.041
No.

46:02.120 --> 46:04.805
I said get up.
And follow me.

46:05.640 --> 46:06.721
Now.

46:22.840 --> 46:23.841
Get in.

46:25.200 --> 46:27.521
Take off your clothes
and get in.

46:27.600 --> 46:28.601
Do it. Now.

46:49.320 --> 46:52.961
There was a DNC meeting earlier this week.
About the Governor's race.

46:53.400 --> 46:55.607
Your name came up as someone
we might want to run.

46:58.080 --> 46:59.969
Aspirin. Go ahead.

47:03.920 --> 47:06.321
Everyone in that room wanted
to cross you off the list.

47:06.400 --> 47:08.084
I said no.
I stuck up for you.

47:08.400 --> 47:10.084
I said, "Peter Russo,
he's got potential.

47:11.440 --> 47:13.966
"He's young, he's capable,
he's going places."

47:15.920 --> 47:18.241
I made them keep you
in contention.

47:18.480 --> 47:20.528
You're still
on that list.

47:21.960 --> 47:26.443
You show up at my house in the middle
of the night, drunk, to whine?

47:27.280 --> 47:29.282
To try to shift
the blame on me?

47:29.360 --> 47:32.762
Instead of taking responsibility
for yourself and your own actions?

47:34.720 --> 47:35.926
Maybe they were right
in that meeting.

47:38.560 --> 47:39.971
Maybe you are worthless.

47:42.920 --> 47:45.526
I'm the only person who
believes in you, Peter,

47:45.600 --> 47:48.080
but maybe
that's one too many.

47:50.600 --> 47:52.807
The hot water will
open up your capillaries.

47:53.080 --> 47:55.606
The aspirin you just took
will make your blood thinner.

47:55.680 --> 47:57.603
It's up to you, Peter...

47:59.520 --> 48:01.887
And if you do decide to
take the coward's way out,

48:02.040 --> 48:05.806
cut along the tracks, not across them.
That's a rookie mistake.

48:26.560 --> 48:28.244
Morning.
Morning.

48:30.160 --> 48:31.491
You need a lift
to the Hill?

48:31.560 --> 48:33.085
I should go home
and change my clothes.

48:33.160 --> 48:34.844
No, no,
we'll drop you.

48:35.720 --> 48:37.484
You want some coffee?

48:49.640 --> 48:50.641
Frank?

48:50.720 --> 48:51.721
One month.

48:53.400 --> 48:54.401
Hmm?

48:54.520 --> 48:56.363
One month sober.

49:02.440 --> 49:03.680
I can give you that.

49:05.080 --> 49:06.889
Not for me. For you.

49:12.200 --> 49:14.248
Has the seed
been planted?

49:14.560 --> 49:17.086
Only Peter can
answer that question.

49:17.360 --> 49:18.725
He has a choice.

49:19.360 --> 49:20.646
Will he wither?

49:20.720 --> 49:22.643
Or will he thrive?

49:23.120 --> 49:24.565
Only time will tell.
