WEBVTT

00:02.274 --> 00:03.117
Give me 360.

00:03.199 --> 00:04.320
- Clear?  - Clear.

00:06.337 --> 00:07.289
He's alive.

00:07.290 --> 00:08.387
Who is he?

00:08.396 --> 00:09.101
His name's Eli James.

00:09.406 --> 00:10.573
He is a psychology professor

00:10.800 --> 00:12.640
with a therapy practice at the university.

00:12.898 --> 00:14.875
So I take it you haven't seen any more ghosts?

00:14.932 --> 00:16.856
- Safe assumption.  - That's a lie!

00:17.358 --> 00:19.174
You can't see them, but you can hear them.

00:19.461 --> 00:21.088
So the good news is, I am not dead.

00:21.592 --> 00:23.877
The bad news is I am going to spend the rest of my life

00:23.877 --> 00:24.631
listening to people who are?

00:24.631 --> 00:26.001
and helping them.

00:26.542 --> 00:27.742
Please help me.

00:27.934 --> 00:29.034
I need you to help me.

00:29.034 --> 00:30.058
Why wouldn't you just listen?

00:30.058 --> 00:31.320
I know you can hear...

00:32.901 --> 00:35.986
The ghost chatter is somewhat down. Doesn't sound like the floor

00:35.986 --> 00:37.502
of the New York Stock Exchange in my head any more

00:38.687 --> 00:39.910
But there is this one little bugger

00:39.910 --> 00:43.371
who speaks up every night by humming.

00:49.426 --> 00:51.073
Sounds like you have a new since ghost,

00:51.073 --> 00:52.088
they pass to you, because they are scared

00:52.088 --> 00:53.103
and no one's listening.

00:53.103 --> 00:55.302
Usually you try to help them as they can

00:55.302 --> 00:57.010
or learn to tune them out

00:57.010 --> 00:59.107
and our time is up for today.

00:59.107 --> 01:00.553
Wow, what?

01:01.604 --> 01:03.311
Now I know how my psych patients feel?

01:03.511 --> 01:05.705
I have someone coming to perform CPR on my computer

01:05.782 --> 01:08.491
and by the way, antique store

01:08.902 --> 01:11.165
My tech can fix anything.

01:11.365 --> 01:12.713
Oh, and he's even early.

01:13.560 --> 01:15.905
Only because all his friends are hanging out at the arcade leader.

01:16.338 --> 01:17.016
Oh, it's working.

01:17.623 --> 01:18.151
You're my hero.

01:18.829 --> 01:20.647
If I lost the inventory, your mom would quit.

01:20.737 --> 01:21.283
The files are all there,

01:21.283 --> 01:22.775
and I just have to defrag your hard drives.

01:22.775 --> 01:24.641
Please watch your language,we have company.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.904
Ned, Eli. Eli, Ned.

01:27.404 --> 01:28.642
Cool. You are the guy who hears the ghosts.

01:28.642 --> 01:29.882
You're Delia's kid

01:30.382 --> 01:31.386
The one who hears about the ghosts.

01:31.386 --> 01:33.531
It's wild you all of a sudden get the gifts.

01:33.531 --> 01:35.200
Yeah. Well, don't get too excited. There was a catch.

01:35.302 --> 01:36.365
I had to die first.

01:36.365 --> 01:37.766
But good job on the ..

01:40.790 --> 01:41.658
Alt world-2.

01:41.820 --> 01:42.982
Is this version high for now?

01:42.982 --> 01:44.134
Yeah, sort of kinks...

01:44.134 --> 01:46.350
but if you overclock your rig, it kicks

01:46.700 --> 01:47.515
Your kid's amazing...

01:47.890 --> 01:49.620
Wait, this is not the archive you are

01:49.757 --> 01:51.008
Me and my friends, yeah.

01:51.011 --> 01:52.260
I am online right now.

01:52.260 --> 01:53.414
That's my avatar.

01:53.414 --> 01:54.826
Avatar?

01:55.359 --> 01:57.951
What is that? Some sort of ancient weapon?

01:58.649 --> 01:59.674
No, it's me,

01:59.674 --> 02:01.950
or what I look like in the game,

02:01.950 --> 02:03.575
an animated version.

02:03.575 --> 02:05.433
- It could look like...  - The actual gamer

02:05.433 --> 02:06.571
or be a complete fantasy

02:06.823 --> 02:09.845
You can pick hair, skin colour, clothes,

02:09.845 --> 02:12.109
and you can be anyone do anything.

02:12.638 --> 02:14.664
Yeah, that's why I keep a closed eye.

02:16.177 --> 02:17.562
See, there you are.

02:18.421 --> 02:19.817
you just went virtual

02:20.463 --> 02:21.891
Yeah, but I'll never wear my hair like that.

02:22.753 --> 02:24.287
Your avatar does.

02:24.354 --> 02:27.687
So instead of going to an actual place to play games--

02:27.753 --> 02:29.054
Ooh, could you make me taller?

02:29.121 --> 02:30.020
There are games in here.

02:30.087 --> 02:33.020
Mostly it's a place where kids go to hang out in world.

02:33.087 --> 02:34.254
And it's educational.

02:34.321 --> 02:35.921
I mean, you can meet people from around the world.

02:35.988 --> 02:37.954
Ned, show her.

02:39.887 --> 02:41.621
Oh, here come the campus crusaders,

02:41.687 --> 02:42.721
Or...

02:42.787 --> 02:44.454
Are they girl scouts?

02:44.520 --> 02:46.854
The fringe girls. They're from the Halliwell Academy,

02:46.921 --> 02:48.887
Private school. In real life,

02:48.954 --> 02:50.187
yhey wear uniforms.

02:50.253 --> 02:51.854
It's like through the looking glass.

02:51.921 --> 02:53.220
Nothing is ever what it seems.

02:53.287 --> 02:55.787
What about the guy who's standing next to him?

02:55.854 --> 02:58.787
I mean, why is he giving Ned's avatar the evil eye?

02:58.854 --> 03:01.220
That's Phoenix. He's always here,

03:01.287 --> 03:02.988
Always with that same geek look.

03:03.054 --> 03:05.721
Yeah, but, I mean, you guys see the way that he's looking at Ned.

03:08.420 --> 03:09.487
Not really.

03:09.554 --> 03:11.088
He looks the same to me.

03:13.887 --> 03:15.454
Well, how about now?

03:15.520 --> 03:16.754
I mean, he's looking right at me.

03:23.054 --> 03:25.153
Oh, come on!

03:28.654 --> 03:30.253
What?

03:30.320 --> 03:32.420
What's happening? He's not moving.

03:32.487 --> 03:34.821
His gamer must have left his machine.

03:34.887 --> 03:36.287
Didn't log off.

03:41.320 --> 03:43.220
Who are you?

03:43.287 --> 03:45.088
Who are you?! Where am I?!

03:45.187 --> 03:47.153
Who is that? What's happening?

03:47.220 --> 03:49.153
Ok, just--just try to calm down.

03:49.220 --> 03:50.821
Where is she?!

03:52.587 --> 03:54.687
-That can't be good.  -That was a ghost, right?

03:54.754 --> 03:56.621
Who--who are you looking for?

03:56.687 --> 03:59.454
I don't have control!

04:01.000 --> 04:07.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:10.220 --> 04:14.120
Ok, that wasn't an avatar I just heard by any chance, was it?

04:14.187 --> 04:16.620
Yes, Phoenix, or a ghost that looked just like him.

04:16.687 --> 04:18.253
I swear it was nothing I did.

04:18.320 --> 04:20.021
No, it was something I did.

04:20.088 --> 04:23.554
I just drew a ghost out of my machine.

04:56.787 --> 04:58.521
Did that ghost just trash your store

04:58.588 --> 04:59.987
because he was angry about something?

05:00.454 --> 05:02.387
I once had a patient in therapy

05:02.454 --> 05:04.521
who compulsively smashed animal figurines.

05:04.587 --> 05:06.821
No, he was more confused than anything.

05:06.888 --> 05:08.420
He said he wasn't in control.

05:08.487 --> 05:10.654
Like the real world's a new kind of game to him?

05:10.871 --> 05:13.637
Oh, that's so trippy.

05:13.704 --> 05:15.237
Is any of this even possible?

05:15.303 --> 05:17.570
I've seen ghosts interact with electronics before,

05:17.637 --> 05:18.804
But nothing like this.

05:18.871 --> 05:21.270
What would make a ghost decide to go into a game?

05:21.337 --> 05:23.237
Why would he come out looking like his avatar?

05:23.303 --> 05:25.704
Sometimes spirits appear as they remember themselves,

05:25.771 --> 05:27.138
So if he died playing the game,

05:27.203 --> 05:29.270
maybe he thinks he's his own avatar.

05:29.337 --> 05:30.604
Didn't I hear him say, "where is she?"

05:30.671 --> 05:32.270
Means he was looking for someone.

05:32.337 --> 05:34.671
Phoenix hangs out mostly with one of the fringe girls.

05:34.737 --> 05:36.671
Ok, where do they hang?

05:36.737 --> 05:37.971
I'll show you. Come on.

05:41.637 --> 05:43.637
Bookstore cafe.

05:43.704 --> 05:45.871
Free internet and half-decent coffee.

05:47.537 --> 05:49.337
He's here.

05:51.237 --> 05:53.270
Tell me about the girl he likes.

05:53.337 --> 05:56.270
I don't know her name, but her avatar's name is Sedona.

05:56.337 --> 05:59.203
Looks like he just found her.

06:01.370 --> 06:03.337
Hi, honey.

06:03.404 --> 06:05.237
Wait, point me in his direction.

06:05.303 --> 06:07.504
I'm dying to ask him some questions.

06:10.237 --> 06:11.370
He's gone.

06:11.437 --> 06:13.504
And so is Sedona.

06:20.737 --> 06:22.837
Sorry, I couldn't sleep.

06:22.904 --> 06:24.270
I kept thinking about this ghost.

06:24.337 --> 06:26.071
Oh, Phoenix, the avatar ghost.

06:27.337 --> 06:28.671
Ned says he was always online,

06:28.737 --> 06:29.871
So I'm going with the theory

06:29.937 --> 06:31.637
That he died while playing.

06:31.704 --> 06:34.671
Death by gaming O.D. Wow.

06:34.737 --> 06:37.004
Although, you know, it's very possible in college,

06:37.071 --> 06:39.637
I may have collapsed after 10 straight hours of playing asteroids.

06:39.704 --> 06:41.737
You sure that wasn't the kegger?

06:41.804 --> 06:44.237
I did a search for anyone who died while gaming,

06:44.303 --> 06:46.138
and suprisingly, there're a few.

06:46.203 --> 06:47.504
I've narrowed it down to that guy,

06:47.570 --> 06:50.504
One in Korea and one in Oregon, Curtis Green.

06:50.570 --> 06:54.737
Wait, died after 5 straight days of gaming. Huh.

06:54.804 --> 06:56.038
What, he didn't eat, he didn't sleep,

06:56.104 --> 06:57.270
He didn't drink?

06:57.337 --> 06:59.004
Nope, he died of dehydration.

06:59.071 --> 07:01.203
Wait, shouldn't the internet gaming people

07:01.270 --> 07:02.570
be able to tell you who Phoenix really was?

07:02.637 --> 07:04.237
Yeah, maybe, except the only thing I could access

07:04.303 --> 07:05.771
was his avatar bio.

07:05.837 --> 07:08.104
FYI, he's into fast cars and coldplay.

07:08.170 --> 07:11.004
Coldplay. Could be any teenager anywhere, huh?

07:11.071 --> 07:12.971
Exactly, it's the world wide web for god sakes.

07:13.038 --> 07:14.537
He could be a 10-year-old in Siberia.

07:17.104 --> 07:20.203
Wait, what about the girl from the bookstore?

07:20.270 --> 07:22.004
She hung out with Phoenix online.

07:22.071 --> 07:23.837
Maybe she knows something about him.

07:23.904 --> 07:25.937
That's what I'm hoping.

07:26.404 --> 07:30.038
That looks like the girl that Phoenix was haunting yesterday.

07:30.104 --> 07:31.871
I'm betting that's Sedona.

07:31.937 --> 07:33.837
And those are her laced-up pals

07:33.904 --> 07:36.470
with the tatted up avatars. Got it.

07:36.537 --> 07:38.804
So assuming this guy died from gaming,

07:38.871 --> 07:41.138
Here's what Mel's come up with.

07:42.203 --> 07:43.971
These are from all around the world.

07:44.038 --> 07:46.038
Would the ghost have an accent?

07:46.104 --> 07:47.570
This one didn't.

07:47.637 --> 07:49.170
So, uh...

07:50.771 --> 07:53.038
Go make nice. See what she knows about Phoenix

07:53.104 --> 07:54.804
and this Curtis kid from Oregon.

07:54.871 --> 07:56.470
She doesn't look much like a chit-chatter.

07:56.537 --> 07:59.404
Than use some other language.

08:03.771 --> 08:05.570
Oh, well, that was

08:05.637 --> 08:07.904
a relatively painless inventory,

08:07.971 --> 08:09.704
besides the little computer glitch,

08:09.771 --> 08:11.604
or should I say computer ghost.

08:11.671 --> 08:13.704
Only apparently he's an out here ghost now

08:13.771 --> 08:17.437
because his avatar has not budged since yesterday.

08:17.504 --> 08:19.871
Is that what you've been watching all day?

08:19.937 --> 08:21.504
And all night. I'm obsessed.

08:21.570 --> 08:23.170
I mean, I have no idea how to work my own avatar,

08:23.237 --> 08:24.270
But I can't stop watching his.

08:24.337 --> 08:25.637
I mean, I drew a spirit

08:25.704 --> 08:28.004
out of a computer game. How freaky is that?

08:28.071 --> 08:29.771
Yeah, half the time I'm online,

08:29.837 --> 08:31.937
I am sure that there's a ghost in there.

08:32.004 --> 08:33.671
You know, speaking metaphorically.

08:33.736 --> 08:35.671
Yeah, well, this one might actually be. And if he is,

08:35.736 --> 08:37.703
he's a ghost that communicates with the living,

08:37.770 --> 08:40.004
which is why I'd like to figure out what his story is.

08:40.071 --> 08:43.038
Yeah, it sounds like maybe this guy is into cosplay,

08:43.104 --> 08:46.071
You know, people who dress up like their avatars.

08:46.138 --> 08:47.804
No, I don't know, and how do you?

08:47.871 --> 08:51.138
Well, when you have a teenager, it's kind of dangerous not to know.

08:51.203 --> 08:52.671
Hey, I bet you did't know

08:52.737 --> 08:54.804
that it only takes an I.M. Chat

08:54.871 --> 08:56.604
for someone to access your webcam.

08:56.671 --> 08:58.537
Yeah, but Ned is smarter than that.

08:58.604 --> 09:00.971
Yeah, I know, I know. It's just...

09:00.971 --> 09:02.570
everybody else I'm worried about.

09:13.404 --> 09:16.570
Ha, take that, sucka!

09:16.637 --> 09:20.004
Hey, give a newbie a break.

09:35.704 --> 09:38.237
It's not right.

09:38.303 --> 09:40.138
You have mad skills and a fast machine.

09:40.203 --> 09:44.337
My dad guilt-gifted it to me after he moved out.

09:44.404 --> 09:45.671
Sorry.

09:45.737 --> 09:48.337
Thanks, but I'm over it.

09:48.404 --> 09:50.570
So, uh, you're redstar?

09:50.637 --> 09:52.370
Ned. Yeah, I've seen you in there, too.

09:52.437 --> 09:54.071
I'm Alise.

09:54.138 --> 09:57.104
Yeah, so you hang out with that Phoenix guy, right?

09:57.170 --> 09:59.771
-What's up with him?  -Oh, don't know.

09:59.837 --> 10:01.370
Probably stopped playing and forgot to log off.

10:01.420 --> 10:03.370
Do you know the guy, the gamer?

10:03.487 --> 10:05.104
I only know him online.

10:05.170 --> 10:07.203
Ever think something might have happened?

10:07.270 --> 10:10.404
Like I heard about that guy in Oregon who died gaming.

10:10.470 --> 10:11.737
What, you think it could be Phoenix?

10:11.804 --> 10:14.270
That would be so sad. I really like him.

10:14.337 --> 10:15.470
Stay away from her!

10:15.537 --> 10:17.270
The guy who keeled, Curtis Green,

10:17.337 --> 10:18.904
died like 3 weeks ago.

10:18.971 --> 10:20.737
Well, then it's not him for sure.

10:20.804 --> 10:22.437
Phoenix just froze up yesterday.

10:22.504 --> 10:24.270
I was hanging in world with him when it happened.

10:24.337 --> 10:27.138
I said, leave her alone!

10:27.203 --> 10:29.370
You, over here! Talk to me.

10:35.737 --> 10:36.937
Do you know him?

10:37.004 --> 10:38.971
What's your game with her?

10:39.038 --> 10:40.837
What's your game?

10:40.904 --> 10:42.071
No, I've never seen him before.

10:42.138 --> 10:43.470
You think you're her boyfriend?

10:43.537 --> 10:45.504
She doesn't even have a clue who you even are.

10:45.570 --> 10:47.104
This isn't real.

10:47.170 --> 10:49.270
You're in a game, it's all fantasy.

10:49.337 --> 10:51.504
She knows I'm real. That's why she talks to me.

10:51.570 --> 10:55.470
You're real in a sense, Yes. But that is not the issue.

10:55.537 --> 10:58.038
The issue is, who am I talking to?!

10:59.270 --> 11:01.437
I'm Phoenix, ok?

11:01.504 --> 11:05.138
That's all you need to know. Now leave us alone!

11:07.937 --> 11:10.904
It's the classic case of grandiose delusional disorder.

11:10.971 --> 11:12.971
He believes he's her boyfriend,

11:13.038 --> 11:14.504
And she's the perfect target...

11:14.570 --> 11:15.954
Sweet, shy, troubled,

11:15.960 --> 11:17.300
And she lives online.

11:17.367 --> 11:18.901
And how do you usually treat something like this?

11:18.968 --> 11:20.167
Change their frame of reference.

11:20.234 --> 11:21.767
Jar them out of their fiction.

11:21.834 --> 11:23.934
Like tell him who he actually is?

11:24.000 --> 11:25.601
That's a good start,

11:25.667 --> 11:27.667
If we knew who he really is.

11:27.734 --> 11:31.100
Well, could we track his I.P. address through the game?

11:31.367 --> 11:33.867
Hey, they did it on CSI!

11:35.634 --> 11:37.600
I think there'd have to be a criminal investigation.

11:37.667 --> 11:39.400
or we could just...

11:39.467 --> 11:41.267
talk to someone where he lives,

11:41.333 --> 11:43.134
in here.

11:43.300 --> 11:44.834
He's gone!

11:45.401 --> 11:46.700
Phoenix isn't there anymore.

11:46.767 --> 11:48.367
I've been watching since he first came out.

11:48.434 --> 11:51.833
He's been frozen. He was right there!

12:11.568 --> 12:12.967
He was in there.

12:13.034 --> 12:15.467
What happened? Your avatar started to move.

12:15.534 --> 12:17.634
Because I was in there, too. I had a vision.

12:17.700 --> 12:19.401
Only, it was different.

12:19.467 --> 12:22.000
It was like I was a part of that world, you know?

12:22.067 --> 12:24.134
I think I was seeing the game the way that he does.

12:24.201 --> 12:27.134
Ok, I don't like the idea of that guy in your head.

12:27.200 --> 12:28.067
Me either.

12:28.134 --> 12:29.300
But if we want to find out who Phoenix is

12:29.367 --> 12:31.100
Or why he's haunting Alise,

12:31.167 --> 12:33.067
It might be the only way.

12:43.200 --> 12:45.967
Hey, I'm looking for Phoenix.

12:49.600 --> 12:52.367
He was just here.

12:52.434 --> 12:53.934
Are you friends with him?

12:55.467 --> 12:56.967
Who wants to know?

13:05.767 --> 13:07.167
You don't belong here.

13:22.833 --> 13:24.100
You don't belong here, either.

13:24.167 --> 13:25.100
Just tell me who you are.

13:25.167 --> 13:27.267
No! You're ruining everything!

13:27.334 --> 13:28.834
This wasn't real when you were alive,

13:28.901 --> 13:30.434
And it's not real now.

13:30.501 --> 13:33.133
There has to be somebody in your real life that you want to talk to.

13:33.200 --> 13:34.868
I can help you!

13:44.367 --> 13:45.968
All right, that's enough!

13:46.033 --> 13:47.667
I don't think so.

13:57.200 --> 13:59.901
If you see a light, pal, go for it.

13:59.968 --> 14:02.701
No...way!

14:34.167 --> 14:36.200
Melinda!

14:36.267 --> 14:38.601
Ok, that's enough fun.

14:38.667 --> 14:41.133
It was...

14:41.200 --> 14:44.400
everything in there, it was real for my ghost.

14:44.467 --> 14:46.334
You were kickin' some ass.

14:46.400 --> 14:48.267
I was, right?

14:48.334 --> 14:49.934
Looked like he landed a few good hits, too.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.668
Looked like he was kind of hurting you.

14:51.734 --> 14:53.701
No. I mean, I felt it in the game,

14:53.768 --> 14:55.600
But not now.

14:55.767 --> 14:57.034
Hey, his avatar's gone again.

14:57.101 --> 14:58.700
That's ok. He'll be back.

14:58.767 --> 15:00.267
It's the only way he can talk to Alise.

15:00.334 --> 15:01.734
That's not the only way he can be with her.

15:01.800 --> 15:03.834
He's a ghost.

15:03.900 --> 15:05.767
How can we find a guy who doesn't want to be found?

15:07.234 --> 15:08.567
We get lucky.

15:08.633 --> 15:12.067
Looks like Phoenix sent you an email.

15:12.134 --> 15:14.434
I don't understand. Now he wants me to find him?

15:14.500 --> 15:17.001
He's a gamer. Maybe he likes to play games.

15:17.067 --> 15:19.334
Ok then.

15:19.401 --> 15:21.301
Let's play.

15:26.101 --> 15:27.434
No good.

15:27.500 --> 15:29.134
Guess it would be, seeing how the guy is dead.

15:29.201 --> 15:32.167
Some kind of business address.

15:38.001 --> 15:40.368
Ingram, Nash, Reynolds, Coben and company.

15:40.434 --> 15:42.201
That's an ad firm in Hamilton.

15:42.267 --> 15:44.401
So our dead guy's this Berrit dude?

15:44.468 --> 15:46.317
Ok, you go see if Phoenix ever

15:46.317 --> 15:48.167
sent Alise any emails from this address.

15:48.234 --> 15:51.334
We'll see if we can find our ghost.

15:51.401 --> 15:55.867
Berrit, incr-c.com? Never heard of him.

15:55.934 --> 15:58.134
Is he one of those guys who died gaming?

15:58.201 --> 15:59.867
No, he's just someone I met in-world.

15:59.934 --> 16:02.600
You spend too much time online.

16:02.667 --> 16:04.301
I wish I could spend that much time online.

16:04.368 --> 16:06.167
My mom thinks the internet's evil.

16:06.234 --> 16:07.600
Did you want something?

16:07.667 --> 16:09.234
Oh, no, thanks.

16:09.501 --> 16:11.601
- Mine's the opposite. - Oh, your mom?

16:11.668 --> 16:13.668
With the web, she's cool,

16:13.733 --> 16:16.634
But she doesn't trust me to blow my nose out here in the real world.

16:16.700 --> 16:18.833
Well, it would be worse if your parents didn't care, right?

16:18.900 --> 16:21.401
Yeah, I've got one of them, too.

16:21.467 --> 16:23.934
Anyway,

16:24.000 --> 16:26.301
At least I have my online friends I can gripe to.

16:26.301 --> 16:29.501
Ok, but how do you know they're your friends

16:29.568 --> 16:30.733
You don't really know who they are.

16:30.800 --> 16:32.767
I don't really know you.

16:32.833 --> 16:35.534
True that.

16:35.601 --> 16:38.833
I think you get to know who people really are more online.

16:38.900 --> 16:40.534
Barriers come down.

16:40.601 --> 16:43.034
I guess, but...

16:43.100 --> 16:44.534
what about when it goes offline,

16:44.601 --> 16:46.267
And it's not what you thought?

16:46.334 --> 16:48.668
Have you ever had a thing go offline?

16:48.767 --> 16:51.034
I've emailed, talked on cell, sure.

16:51.100 --> 16:53.201
You felt safe doing that?

16:53.267 --> 16:56.867
Safe as anything in real life turned out to be.

16:56.934 --> 17:00.134
You mean, like your family?

17:00.201 --> 17:03.201
Thought we'd always be together.

17:03.267 --> 17:06.233
Then one day I come home, and it's gone.

17:06.300 --> 17:08.900
No more.

17:08.967 --> 17:12.134
At least with this, I can always count on it being there.

17:18.634 --> 17:20.401
Mr. Berrit...

17:20.467 --> 17:22.568
No, sorry, he's not with the firm.

17:22.634 --> 17:24.166
Well, I know he wouldn't be anymore,

17:24.233 --> 17:25.601
But did he ever work here?

17:25.667 --> 17:28.900
Wait, do you mean Errit, Mr. Bill Errit?

17:28.967 --> 17:30.767
He's in now.

17:31.900 --> 17:33.000
Isn't he supposed to be dead?

17:33.067 --> 17:35.601
Curioser and curioser.

17:36.767 --> 17:38.800
Oh, god, not again.

17:38.867 --> 17:40.700
I thought I was through with this.

17:40.767 --> 17:41.900
With what?

17:41.967 --> 17:45.367
About 2 weeks ago, the FBI shows up here.

17:45.434 --> 17:48.167
Accuses me of cyber-stalking...

17:48.234 --> 17:51.100
Luring underage girls and transmitting pornography.

17:51.167 --> 17:52.867
So you didn't send the email?

17:52.934 --> 17:55.100
Of course not. Someone stole my address,

17:55.167 --> 17:57.000
And the guy who did's a real winner,

17:57.067 --> 17:58.967
judging from the stuff they thought I did.

17:59.034 --> 18:00.767
What kind of stuff?

18:00.833 --> 18:04.134
He deals in candid, suggestive photos

18:04.201 --> 18:07.501
of beautiful young women. Of teenagers, mostly.

18:07.568 --> 18:09.401
God knows how he gets them to do it.

18:09.467 --> 18:11.550
Cops said some of them even

18:11.550 --> 18:13.634
end in webcam shots of themselves.

18:13.700 --> 18:16.000
I saw the stuff, and I wish I hadn't.

18:16.067 --> 18:18.201
So the guy who sent me the email, he's a predator?

18:18.267 --> 18:19.733
And a good one.

18:19.800 --> 18:22.733
They've traced stolen emails to him all across the country,

18:22.800 --> 18:25.534
But he's always gone by the time they get there.

18:27.100 --> 18:30.401
That's the agent handling the case.

18:30.467 --> 18:32.301
If this pervert's after you now,

18:32.367 --> 18:34.668
I'd call him.

18:34.733 --> 18:36.800
Can't be too sad when a perv bites it.

18:36.867 --> 18:38.167
Yeah, except it doesn't change anything.

18:38.234 --> 18:40.067
I mean, the ghost controls a computer.

18:40.134 --> 18:41.833
It can get young girls to do things,

18:41.900 --> 18:43.534
like maybe even turn on a webcam.

18:43.601 --> 18:45.301
Well, I know a cop.

18:45.367 --> 18:47.700
I used to help her profile some cases.

18:47.767 --> 18:49.067
Let me call her.

18:49.134 --> 18:50.999
Look, whoever created Phoenix

18:51.000 --> 18:52.568
is a cyber-perv.

18:52.634 --> 18:55.301
He gets pics of teens and puts them on the web!

18:55.367 --> 18:57.367
Ok, but if the FBI is handling this case,

18:57.434 --> 18:58.668
Why are you talking to me?

18:58.733 --> 19:00.501
Because I don't know them. I know you.

19:00.568 --> 19:02.700
And you owe me, remember?

19:02.767 --> 19:04.467
What?

19:04.534 --> 19:06.900
Oh, um, the I.D. thief I helped you profile?

19:09.467 --> 19:12.733
Fine. I will try to subpoena the game for an email ID.

19:12.800 --> 19:13.900
But don't get your hopes up.

19:13.967 --> 19:15.434
These guys switch servers all the time.

19:15.501 --> 19:17.001
Internet cafes, motels,

19:17.067 --> 19:18.700
Your random, roaming WI-FI.

19:18.700 --> 19:19.934
So even if we get an address,

19:20.000 --> 19:21.733
I doubt the guy will still be there.

19:21.733 --> 19:24.601
Unless he's dead

19:24.668 --> 19:26.767
Yeah, I'm gonna be a little late.

19:26.833 --> 19:29.733
It turns out this ghost is a total creep, so...

19:31.334 --> 19:33.334
Uh, you know what?

19:33.401 --> 19:34.867
I'm gonna have to call you back.

19:36.733 --> 19:39.100
I want you to stay the hell away from Alise.

19:39.367 --> 19:40.900
No! I told you--

19:40.967 --> 19:43.034
Save it. I know who you are.

19:43.100 --> 19:44.700
I know what you've done to those girls,

19:44.767 --> 19:45.867
I know that you've tried to ruin their lives,

19:45.934 --> 19:46.967
And you're doing the same thing to Alise.

19:47.034 --> 19:49.000
- I would never... - Yeah, but you did!

19:49.067 --> 19:50.601
Again and again.

19:50.668 --> 19:51.767
I mean, you had to have known better,

19:51.833 --> 19:53.401
But you didn't stop, not even after you died.

19:53.467 --> 19:54.733
You're still stalking Alise.

19:54.800 --> 19:55.967
You're confused.

19:56.034 --> 19:57.401
You don't know who I am.

19:57.467 --> 19:59.833
I just want to protect her.

20:00.967 --> 20:02.568
Did you have a good day?

20:02.634 --> 20:04.700
Yeah!

20:04.767 --> 20:06.568
Get your travel shoes on.

20:06.634 --> 20:08.767
I know where the real Phoenix lives.

20:08.933 --> 20:10.367
Let's go.

20:10.434 --> 20:13.167
Of course he said he was protecting Alise.

20:13.234 --> 20:14.668
He might even believe it.

20:14.734 --> 20:16.267
The guy's a sicko.

20:16.334 --> 20:17.701
Is that a technical term?

20:17.768 --> 20:19.967
Oh, I'm sorry. Twisted sicko.

20:20.034 --> 20:22.267
I don't know, it felt sincere.

20:22.334 --> 20:24.034
Welcome to his world of deception.

20:24.100 --> 20:27.067
These guys find out people's weaknesses, and they prey on it.

20:27.134 --> 20:28.401
What's my weakness?

20:28.667 --> 20:30.367
Trusting sickos.

20:30.434 --> 20:32.667
Oh, come on...

20:32.734 --> 20:33.867
Come on.

20:33.934 --> 20:35.801
We're just going to help ourselves?

20:43.234 --> 20:46.434
Not so sure this is such a good idea.

20:46.501 --> 20:47.868
I'm thinking it may be time

20:47.934 --> 20:49.601
- to call in a higher power... - Shh.

20:49.667 --> 20:51.200
like maybe... the cops.

21:01.934 --> 21:04.767
Ok, from the smell,

21:04.834 --> 21:06.901
I'm guessing that guy is not asleep.

21:11.467 --> 21:13.434
That's the real Phoenix.

21:16.868 --> 21:19.667
Did I call it?

21:19.734 --> 21:21.767
It's a twisted sicko.

21:27.467 --> 21:30.501
Something's not right.

21:40.734 --> 21:43.434
Oh, my god.

21:43.501 --> 21:44.834
He was telling the truth.

21:44.901 --> 21:47.267
He really did just want to protect Alise.

21:47.334 --> 21:49.334
I mean, all of these photos are her.

21:54.834 --> 21:56.367
He's not a predator.

21:56.434 --> 21:59.133
He's Larry Jones.

21:59.200 --> 22:01.968
Alise's dad.

22:08.267 --> 22:11.834
You think he's been dead for what?

22:12.267 --> 22:13.901
Yeah, it was an apparenent heart attack.

22:13.967 --> 22:15.200
They think he's been dead 3 days.

22:15.267 --> 22:16.550
So that's when the ghost must

22:16.550 --> 22:17.834
have gone into the computer.

22:17.901 --> 22:20.400
So he's protecting his daughter, but from what?

22:20.467 --> 22:23.267
And why was he even in the computer? That's just...

22:23.334 --> 22:25.934
I don't know, but he does.

22:26.000 --> 22:29.534
It's the only way I could be a part of her life.

22:29.601 --> 22:31.267
I had a stupid affair.

22:31.334 --> 22:33.934
My wife was bitter, and it rubbed off on Alise.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.383
My daughter made it clear

22:35.383 --> 22:36.767
she didn't want to have anything to do with me,

22:36.834 --> 22:39.234
And I didn't blame her for hating me, but...

22:39.300 --> 22:41.000
god, I missed her.

22:41.067 --> 22:43.601
That's when you came up with Phoenix.

22:43.667 --> 22:46.033
Well, in there, I felt connected to her.

22:46.100 --> 22:47.834
Then what happened?

22:47.901 --> 22:50.200
Well, after I died, I found myself back at home

22:50.267 --> 22:52.767
with Alise, and I saw that she was emailing someone.

22:52.834 --> 22:54.634
Someone in the game?

22:54.701 --> 22:56.267
Yeah, she met him in there.

22:56.334 --> 22:57.801
I mean, I was Phoenix,

22:57.868 --> 22:59.501
and Phoenix was her friend,

22:59.567 --> 23:02.400
But this guy was... more.

23:02.467 --> 23:04.267
I mean, the emails were pretty intimate.

23:04.334 --> 23:06.133
So you suspected he was a predator?

23:06.200 --> 23:08.467
Or a lusty teenager. I didn't know.

23:08.534 --> 23:10.968
I mean, I didn't know if I was being an overprotective dad.

23:11.033 --> 23:13.501
Like when you threw me across the street in the game.

23:13.567 --> 23:15.167
Look, I just didn't want you

23:15.167 --> 23:16.767
to blow my cover with this creep.

23:16.834 --> 23:17.717
But then when I realized that

23:17.717 --> 23:18.601
you were actually trying to help,

23:18.667 --> 23:20.133
That's when I forwarded you on the emails

23:20.200 --> 23:21.300
that this guy sent Alise.

23:21.467 --> 23:23.100
The ones we traced.

23:23.167 --> 23:24.801
So the guy who sent the emails,

23:24.867 --> 23:28.267
He was the same guy that the cops wanted for teen porn?

23:28.334 --> 23:29.500
And when you found that out,

23:29.567 --> 23:30.968
I went back in the game and I tried to warn her,

23:31.034 --> 23:33.133
but she s convinced that he was just a...

23:33.200 --> 23:35.867
happy teen, just like she was,

23:35.934 --> 23:38.133
and she would not listen to me.

23:38.200 --> 23:41.367
It wasn't always like that.

23:43.367 --> 23:45.233
I mean, we used to do things.

23:45.300 --> 23:48.467
We used to laugh.

23:48.534 --> 23:50.434
I know.

23:50.500 --> 23:51.934
I saw your pictures.

23:52.001 --> 23:53.867
The one in the jeep?

23:53.934 --> 23:55.300
Yeah.

23:55.367 --> 23:57.901
We took that in Sedona.

23:57.968 --> 24:03.100
She said that we were the Indiana Joneses.

24:03.167 --> 24:05.867
We ran up this hill

24:05.934 --> 24:08.167
looking for treasure,

24:08.233 --> 24:10.400
and we came down with this leather pouch full of...

24:10.467 --> 24:12.867
I mean, I don't know what.

24:12.934 --> 24:16.200
Rocks and feathers and dirt and...

24:16.267 --> 24:20.100
She said it was magic.

24:20.167 --> 24:23.267
And that it would protect us forever.

24:32.801 --> 24:35.934
Look, you have to warn her.

24:36.001 --> 24:38.133
You have to tell her to be careful.

24:38.200 --> 24:40.001
Please.

24:40.068 --> 24:42.534
Don't worry.

24:43.601 --> 24:45.801
Come on.

24:50.367 --> 24:51.667
Excuse me...

24:51.734 --> 24:53.667
Alise, hi. I'm Melinda Gordon.

24:53.734 --> 24:56.434
I knew your dad, and I'm so sorry.

24:56.500 --> 24:58.968
What's this about?

24:59.034 --> 25:01.434
I think your daughter might be in danger.

25:01.500 --> 25:03.200
Well, the police didn't say anything about that.

25:03.267 --> 25:04.500
That's because they don't know about it.

25:04.567 --> 25:06.467
The predators reached out to Alise online.

25:06.534 --> 25:08.434
He collects pictures of young girls.

25:08.500 --> 25:09.968
Who are you?

25:10.034 --> 25:12.200
I know this is a bad time.

25:12.267 --> 25:13.734
I asked you a question.

25:16.200 --> 25:18.934
Look, I...

25:19.001 --> 25:21.467
we, um, talk to spirits,

25:21.534 --> 25:23.667
And Alise's dad contacted me, so...

25:23.734 --> 25:24.867
Ok, that's enough.

25:24.934 --> 25:26.400
My daughter just lost her dad,

25:26.467 --> 25:29.334
So whatever your story is, tell it to the police.

25:33.901 --> 25:36.534
Follow them! Tell them!

25:36.601 --> 25:37.801
What do you want me to say?

25:37.801 --> 25:39.001
That her dad is a ghost avatar?

25:39.068 --> 25:40.400
It'll never work.

25:40.467 --> 25:41.734
There's only one thing that will.

25:41.801 --> 25:43.100
What?

25:43.167 --> 25:46.200
We find this guy and we stop him.

25:47.934 --> 25:49.834
Are we ready yet?

25:49.901 --> 25:52.334
You're set. All you need to do is get him

25:52.400 --> 25:53.467
to email you, then Eli's friend

25:53.467 --> 25:54.534
can track the I.P.

25:54.601 --> 25:56.067
And wherever that is, Sam said

25:56.067 --> 25:57.534
the FBI can send someone there fast.

25:57.601 --> 25:59.934
Whoa, that's me?

26:00.001 --> 26:01.467
You said you want to lure him, didn't you?

26:01.534 --> 26:03.334
This I gotta see.

26:05.901 --> 26:07.367
There's Alise's avatar,

26:07.434 --> 26:08.500
And that's Cal.

26:08.567 --> 26:10.300
That's who I'm looking for?

26:10.367 --> 26:12.267
I think so. The avatar Alise is talking to,

26:12.334 --> 26:14.200
he's the guy you saw in the game the other day.

26:14.267 --> 26:15.400
Same guy.

26:15.467 --> 26:17.968
Are you ready? You're my only way in.

26:20.200 --> 26:22.901
Ok.

26:22.968 --> 26:26.300
Let's catch a predator.

27:54.133 --> 27:55.901
Melinda, Melinda!

27:55.968 --> 27:58.233
It's...a...

27:58.300 --> 28:00.601
private chatroom!

28:00.667 --> 28:03.334
You can't get in!

28:03.400 --> 28:06.701
All right, I get it, minus an eardrum.

28:06.767 --> 28:08.801
Well, what are you waiting for?

28:08.867 --> 28:10.133
Give him your email, for god sakes.

28:10.200 --> 28:13.400
Be brazen. There's no dating protocol there.

28:15.734 --> 28:18.534
How do we even know he heard me?

28:18.601 --> 28:20.634
We wait.

28:54.800 --> 28:56.300
Hey, dude.

28:56.367 --> 28:57.434
Second  hey, man, let's get out of here.

28:57.500 --> 28:59.400
Thanks for picking us up.

29:13.500 --> 29:15.367
Cal. Hey. Where are you?

29:15.434 --> 29:17.300
I didn't see you in there.

29:17.367 --> 29:18.601
I'm outside.

29:18.667 --> 29:21.100
Oh, snap. I was inside looking for you,

29:21.167 --> 29:23.267
but my friends made me bail.

29:23.334 --> 29:24.901
I was wearing a red shirt.

29:24.968 --> 29:27.400
Geek, you didn't see me? You know what I look like.

29:27.467 --> 29:28.667
I sent you that picture.

29:28.734 --> 29:31.100
No. But a bunch of us are going

29:31.167 --> 29:33.834
to the dance pad contest later at Brookside Mall.

29:33.901 --> 29:35.601
How does that sound?

29:35.667 --> 29:38.300
Well, I don't know, I don't have a car.

29:38.367 --> 29:40.200
I do. I'll pick you up.

29:40.267 --> 29:43.634
You're the Jones that lives on Latimer Road, right?

29:43.701 --> 29:47.001
Wow, you do your homework.

29:47.068 --> 29:50.601
What can I say? I like you.

29:50.667 --> 29:53.934
So I'll be there at 6:00.

30:29.401 --> 30:30.100
Is he still there?

30:30.467 --> 30:31.634
No, he left.

30:31.701 --> 30:32.901
Maybe he's at the virtual cafe.

30:32.968 --> 30:35.233
No, he's not.

30:35.300 --> 30:37.567
Cal and Alise have both logged off,

30:37.634 --> 30:38.934
So what do we do now?

30:39.001 --> 30:41.567
We wait for him to email Melinda's avatar back.

30:41.634 --> 30:42.968
No, I can't wait!

30:43.034 --> 30:45.801
Look, he wants pictures.

30:45.867 --> 30:48.034
All it takes is one weak moment,

30:48.100 --> 30:49.534
and she's very vulnerable right now.

30:49.601 --> 30:51.233
Which is why you have to keep an eye on her.

30:51.300 --> 30:54.434
Ok, let us know if he contacts her again.

30:54.500 --> 30:56.601
Get a cell phone number, email address, anything.

30:56.667 --> 30:58.068
Ok, ok, ok.

30:58.133 --> 31:00.001
Go watch your girl.

31:00.068 --> 31:01.968
We're gonna get this guy, we are.

31:04.200 --> 31:05.400
Are we?

31:05.467 --> 31:07.467
It's looking more promising.

31:07.534 --> 31:09.267
Check this out, just came in.

31:10.500 --> 31:13.467
Obviously he read my cry for help.

31:15.334 --> 31:17.167
Got his service provider.

31:17.233 --> 31:19.534
Eli's cop friend just needs to track his I.P.

31:19.601 --> 31:21.068
Hopefully before he moves again.

31:23.334 --> 31:26.567
Detective Sam Blair, please.

31:26.634 --> 31:28.267
I can't believe he's in Grandview.

31:28.334 --> 31:30.701
Yeah, where's the FBI, the camera, the balloons?

31:30.767 --> 31:33.068
We're about to catch a predator in our hometown.

31:33.133 --> 31:34.701
Look, after that last false alarm,

31:34.767 --> 31:35.934
You're lucky I'm even here.

31:36.001 --> 31:37.701
He's a regular. About a day every month.

31:37.767 --> 31:39.901
Brings his laptop, says he likes quiet.

31:39.968 --> 31:41.167
Sounds like a cyber criminal.

31:41.233 --> 31:42.867
Or a cheating spouse.

31:42.934 --> 31:44.601
Would you mind opening it, please?

31:53.567 --> 31:56.701
Ok, maybe you were right.

31:59.834 --> 32:01.734
Or maybe you were.

32:01.801 --> 32:05.233
Looks like we found his private stash.

32:05.300 --> 32:07.233
He's here for Alise.

32:07.300 --> 32:09.001
All right, I'm going to need address, phone numbers,

32:09.068 --> 32:10.968
and nobody touch anything else in here.

32:18.934 --> 32:21.901
Hey, Cal, what's up? Where are you?

32:21.968 --> 32:24.089
Home. My brother's not back with my mom's car.

32:24.100 --> 32:25.234
Bummer.

32:25.300 --> 32:27.634
I know. This thing's starting in 20.

32:27.701 --> 32:29.567
We're all headin' over.

32:29.634 --> 32:31.200
Ok, well, have fun.

32:31.267 --> 32:33.467
No, freak, I'm tryin' to tell you,

32:33.534 --> 32:35.501
My brother's near your house.

32:35.567 --> 32:37.467
He'll probably drive by on his way home.

32:39.100 --> 32:40.334
Well, I don't know.

32:40.400 --> 32:42.133
Oh, right.

32:42.200 --> 32:44.534
You probably need to ask your mom first.

32:44.601 --> 32:47.100
No, it's not that. It's just...

32:47.167 --> 32:49.501
Sorry, my friends are here.

32:49.567 --> 32:51.434
I can't hear.

32:51.501 --> 32:54.133
Whatever you decide's ok.

33:19.601 --> 33:20.567
We got in touch with the mom.

33:20.634 --> 33:21.767
Alise was supposed to be home,

33:21.834 --> 33:22.934
but she hasn't been answering her cell.

33:23.000 --> 33:23.934
Has anyone checked the house?

33:24.000 --> 33:25.200
A patrol car's driving by now.

33:25.267 --> 33:26.801
They're in a blue minivan.

33:26.868 --> 33:28.667
I am never going to get used to that.

33:28.734 --> 33:30.300
What?

33:30.367 --> 33:32.234
That I forgot to tell you

33:32.300 --> 33:34.667
that the predator's driving a blue minivan.

33:34.734 --> 33:37.200
License number GRK998.

33:37.267 --> 33:40.300
License plate number GRK998.

33:40.367 --> 33:44.601
Ok. Not sure how you forgot that, but I'll tell them.

33:44.667 --> 33:46.334
Look, you don't understand, he's there now.

33:46.400 --> 33:48.701
He's picking her up, now, now!

33:48.767 --> 33:51.334
Ok, just... please go and tell Sam that he's already there.

33:51.400 --> 33:53.334
Don't worry, all right?

33:53.400 --> 33:55.234
The police are on their way.

34:01.367 --> 34:03.133
You must be Alise. I'm Cal's brother.

34:03.200 --> 34:06.100
Hop in. We'll pick up the others on the way.

34:06.167 --> 34:11.199
- What's wrong?  - Well, it's just,

34:12.868 --> 34:15.199
I just... I don't know.

34:15.266 --> 34:18.132
Ah, I get it.

34:18.199 --> 34:21.167
You're not sure you should go anywhere with the big bad brother.

34:21.234 --> 34:23.534
No, it's not that.

34:23.601 --> 34:26.667
It's just... well, I don't know you.

34:26.734 --> 34:28.667
It's cool. Cal told me

34:28.734 --> 34:30.167
How your mom has you on a short leash.

34:30.234 --> 34:31.534
I get it. I'm older,

34:31.601 --> 34:33.234
practically an only kid.

34:33.300 --> 34:36.801
You just want to say,"hey,I have a brain,

34:36.868 --> 34:38.868
I can think for myself."

34:38.934 --> 34:42.266
Yeah, that's for sure.

34:42.333 --> 34:44.333
Look, maybe when your mom gets home,

34:44.400 --> 34:46.868
She can drive you over.

34:46.934 --> 34:52.868
Yeah.Yeah, she's...whatever.

34:54.766 --> 34:58.267
Anyway, I, uh, I gotta get going.

34:58.334 --> 35:00.567
Little bro's gonna be pissed if I make him late,

35:00.634 --> 35:06.067
So...you comin'?

35:09.033 --> 35:12.934
Yeah. Um, just wait one sec.

35:43.367 --> 35:44.634
All set?

35:44.701 --> 35:46.567
Get out!

35:46.634 --> 35:47.868
Get out of the car!

35:47.934 --> 35:49.033
Ready.

35:49.133 --> 35:51.868
Get out! Alise, No. No!

35:51.934 --> 35:57.767
No! Alise!

36:08.934 --> 36:10.634
They just left, you can catch them.

36:10.700 --> 36:12.967
I've been calling her on her cell. She's not picking up.

36:13.034 --> 36:14.201
No, no, no, they're not in there!

36:14.268 --> 36:16.001
They're in a van, a blue van!

36:16.067 --> 36:19.533
Argh, this is not happening!

36:19.600 --> 36:21.067
Sam said there's no word yet.

36:21.134 --> 36:22.368
She's in the car.

36:22.433 --> 36:24.201
I don't know what to do, I'm completely helpless!

36:24.268 --> 36:26.101
I just don't know how to protect her.

36:26.167 --> 36:28.034
Ok, where are they? Where were they heading?

36:28.101 --> 36:30.101
They started toward Brookside, and they turned off the highway.

36:30.167 --> 36:31.368
I'll tell Sam.

36:31.433 --> 36:32.500
There's still something you can do.

36:32.567 --> 36:34.001
No, no, she got in the car!

36:34.067 --> 36:35.368
I couldn't stop her!

36:35.433 --> 36:36.767
Yeah, but you can stop him.

36:36.834 --> 36:38.433
Hello, I tried!

36:38.500 --> 36:39.934
I'm a ghost, people walk through me!

36:40.001 --> 36:41.368
I know that, but you're the only one

36:41.433 --> 36:42.800
who can help Alise right now.

36:42.867 --> 36:45.467
Look, you love your little girl.

36:45.533 --> 36:47.400
Ok, now believe that you can do this.

36:47.467 --> 36:49.600
You have the power to stop him.

37:00.268 --> 37:02.901
This isn't Brookside.

37:15.767 --> 37:17.700
I think you should me out here.

37:17.767 --> 37:21.001
Huh? What are you...

37:22.700 --> 37:25.034
Look, no one made you get in this car.

37:25.101 --> 37:26.567
You wanted to.

37:26.634 --> 37:28.067
Relax, it's only pictures.

37:28.134 --> 37:29.867
I didn't know.

37:29.934 --> 37:32.667
Oh, come on! You knew.

37:32.734 --> 37:36.368
Let's not pretend. You knew.

38:02.700 --> 38:05.134
Daddy's dead.

38:05.201 --> 38:06.834
He can't help you anymore.

38:10.101 --> 38:13.901
Hazard, hazard. Stop the car.

38:13.967 --> 38:15.167
Stop the car.

38:15.234 --> 38:16.567
At the end of the road

38:16.634 --> 38:17.767
What is going on?

38:21.867 --> 38:24.001
- Did you touch something? - I don't

38:24.067 --> 38:26.667
Turn left now.

38:33.433 --> 38:34.667
Oh! What the

38:44.433 --> 38:45.700
Come here.

38:45.767 --> 38:46.867
Get away!

38:46.934 --> 38:48.533
No way in hell!

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
You gotta be kidding me.

39:00.600 --> 39:02.000
Freeze! Don't move!

39:02.500 --> 39:04.534
All right, ok!

39:04.600 --> 39:06.066
On the ground, on the ground now!

39:06.133 --> 39:07.267
Ok!

39:08.000 --> 39:10.367
Let me see your hands!

39:14.100 --> 39:16.433
It's ok, sweetheart.

39:17.766 --> 39:19.500
Thank god you're ok.

39:33.900 --> 39:35.799
Thanks.

39:37.966 --> 39:40.333
So the FBI's been tracking this guy for over a year.

39:40.400 --> 39:41.766
How'd you get all this information?

39:41.833 --> 39:43.933
I do what any good shrink does

39:44.000 --> 39:45.733
I talk to ghosts.

39:45.799 --> 39:48.000
I do, really.

39:48.500 --> 39:51.333
No, one showed up last night. It...

39:53.333 --> 39:55.733
I don't know how or why you did or what you did,

39:55.799 --> 39:57.733
But I'll never be able to thank you enough.

39:57.799 --> 39:59.367
It wasn't me.

39:59.433 --> 40:01.666
It was your husband.

40:01.733 --> 40:04.066
I don't understand.

40:04.133 --> 40:08.367
It's ok. I'll explain later.

40:08.433 --> 40:11.666
I didn't realize how insignificant Alise felt

40:11.733 --> 40:13.300
after the divorce,

40:13.367 --> 40:17.367
So I guess I was just too busy trying to get through another day.

40:17.433 --> 40:19.534
Ok, mom, enough sharing.

40:19.600 --> 40:24.033
- I think I need a minute alone.  - Sure.

40:30.500 --> 40:32.534
That was him, wasn't it?

40:32.600 --> 40:35.000
He did all those things in the car?

40:35.066 --> 40:37.333
Yes.

40:37.400 --> 40:41.400
And he's here with us right now.

40:41.467 --> 40:43.100
He can hear you.

40:43.167 --> 40:46.634
He told me about the day that you filled that.

40:46.699 --> 40:51.467
He said you,  you thought it was magic.

40:51.534 --> 40:53.699
Because we did it together.

40:55.534 --> 40:57.833
And then he left.

40:57.900 --> 40:59.799
He fought for me today,

40:59.799 --> 41:01.699
but why didn't he fight for me back then?

41:01.766 --> 41:03.200
Why did he just leave?

41:03.267 --> 41:05.500
Tell her... tell her I'm sorry.

41:05.567 --> 41:08.866
I did fight. I just... it was too little, too late.

41:08.933 --> 41:10.300
He's sorry.

41:10.367 --> 41:13.133
He never wanted to stop being a part of your life.

41:13.200 --> 41:17.567
- Is that true?  - Yes.

41:17.634 --> 41:21.167
Oh... tell her,tell her what I did.

41:21.233 --> 41:22.699
He was your friend.

41:22.966 --> 41:26.200
In the game.  He was Phoenix.

41:26.266 --> 41:28.899
He created that avatar just so he could be with you.

41:28.966 --> 41:32.333
My dad?  It's computers.

41:32.400 --> 41:33.866
He can hardly work a cell phone.

41:33.933 --> 41:36.834
Well, he figured out how.

41:36.899 --> 41:39.133
just to be with you.

41:46.600 --> 41:48.899
Wish I could stay now.

41:58.266 --> 42:00.166
I love you, too, daddy.

42:10.367 --> 42:11.966
He sees the light.

42:14.834 --> 42:17.899
And now that he knows you're safe, he can go.

42:20.899 --> 42:24.300
Thank you.

42:24.367 --> 42:26.200
Tell him good-bye.

42:34.400 --> 42:35.966
It's ok.

42:42.899 --> 42:50.933
She's gonna be fine.

43:11.734 --> 43:14.600
- Sam offered me a job.  - And?

43:14.667 --> 43:16.100
I said I was happy shrinking heads

43:16.166 --> 43:18.866
and sending disembodied voices into the light.

43:19.866 --> 43:22.233
Come on.

43:22.300 --> 43:24.266
You know, you've got to stop

43:24.333 --> 43:26.600
telling everybody that you can hear ghosts.

43:26.667 --> 43:28.266
Why?  No one believes me.

43:28.333 --> 43:30.266
People are gonna start thinking you're nuts.

43:30.333 --> 43:32.200
Trust me, I've been there.

43:32.266 --> 43:34.700
People think I'm nuts already.
