WEBVTT

00:01.366 --> 00:02.500
DONNELL: Last season on
"The Practice"

00:04.833 --> 00:06.366
We need to talk, Clarice.

00:06.400 --> 00:08.132
There's a restraining order.

00:08.166 --> 00:10.000
You just screwed up.
O'MALLEY: I promise.

00:10.033 --> 00:11.800
I'm not here to cause
anybody any harm.

00:11.833 --> 00:13.466
I just need to talk to her.

00:13.500 --> 00:15.066
Get out before I throw you out!

00:15.100 --> 00:16.766
O'MALLEY:
You're in danger, Clarice.

00:17.466 --> 00:19.033
He is coming for you.

00:19.066 --> 00:20.300
Only I can save you.

00:20.333 --> 00:22.400
Why don't you go on ahead
without me?

00:22.433 --> 00:24.300
(gunshot)
Lindsay!

00:24.333 --> 00:26.066
(gun shots)

00:26.100 --> 00:28.866
WALSH: She just shot him dead
in cold blood.

00:28.900 --> 00:32.299
This was first-degree homicide.

00:32.333 --> 00:34.333
We've heard testimony
of another client

00:34.366 --> 00:35.800
who terrorized your wife.

00:35.833 --> 00:37.000
What happened to him?

00:37.033 --> 00:37.900
He was killed.

00:37.933 --> 00:39.066
WALSH: He was murdered

00:39.100 --> 00:41.166
and you were arrested
for conspiracy

00:41.200 --> 00:43.266
to commit murder.
I was acquitted.

00:43.300 --> 00:46.233
WALSH: I smell a pattern,
threaten Lindsay Dole,

00:46.266 --> 00:47.300
you get killed.

00:47.333 --> 00:48.433
Objection!

00:48.466 --> 00:50.333
GAMBLE: Lindsay
killed an unarmed man.

00:50.366 --> 00:53.266
The burden of an excuse
is on you.

00:53.300 --> 00:56.266
DONNELL: None of us
think of you as a murderer

00:56.300 --> 00:58.433
because you're not.
I was there.

00:58.466 --> 00:59.533
I saw it.

00:59.566 --> 01:01.640
You snapped.

01:01.673 --> 01:03.006
Okay.

01:03.873 --> 01:07.273
When he came,
I knew it was probably him,

01:07.306 --> 01:09.139
but I opened my door anyway.

01:09.173 --> 01:10.906
I wasn't gonna be a victim.

01:11.606 --> 01:12.773
It was my house.

01:12.806 --> 01:14.806
And after you opened the door?

01:14.840 --> 01:16.240
I killed him.

01:17.473 --> 01:18.406
WEST: Madam foreperson,

01:18.440 --> 01:20.606
the jury has reached
a unanimous verdict?

01:20.640 --> 01:22.906
WOMAN: We have, Your Honor.
WEST: What say you?

01:22.940 --> 01:26.806
WOMAN: We find the defendant,
Lindsay Dole, guilty.

01:26.840 --> 01:29.773
(indistinct chatter)

01:48.940 --> 01:52.873
(music playing)

02:11.646 --> 02:13.280
They're bringing her in.

02:20.613 --> 02:23.313
MAN: Commonwealth
versus Lindsay Dole, sentencing.

02:35.846 --> 02:36.980
Mr. Walsh?

02:37.446 --> 02:38.480
I have nothing, Your Honor,

02:38.513 --> 02:39.646
other than to remind the court

02:39.680 --> 02:41.046
that the crime
for which Ms. Dole

02:41.080 --> 02:42.046
was convicted is murder.

02:42.080 --> 02:44.413
The taking of human life
is not only an act

02:44.446 --> 02:47.013
against that life
but a crime against law,

02:47.046 --> 02:49.213
humanity, the Commonwealth,

02:49.246 --> 02:51.113
and we feel that
the statutory sentence

02:51.146 --> 02:52.413
is appropriate.

02:54.880 --> 02:56.113
Mr. Young?

02:59.180 --> 03:01.920
Your Honor, we would ask
the court at this time

03:01.953 --> 03:04.886
to convert Ms. Dole's conviction
from first-degree murder

03:04.920 --> 03:06.220
to voluntary manslaughter.

03:06.253 --> 03:07.820
The Commonwealth opposes.

03:07.853 --> 03:10.520
YOUNG: You have before you
the psychological examinations

03:10.553 --> 03:13.320
done by both the Commonwealth
and the defense

03:13.353 --> 03:15.853
which all conclude
that Ms. Dole's state of mind

03:15.886 --> 03:17.320
was severely compromised

03:17.353 --> 03:19.520
at the time
she committed this crime.

03:19.553 --> 03:22.386
The court can also take
judicial notice of the facts.

03:22.420 --> 03:24.886
Ms. Dole did not act
with any aforethought.

03:24.920 --> 03:26.486
There was no premeditation.

03:26.520 --> 03:28.653
Her own husband
was in the line of fire.

03:28.686 --> 03:31.353
Now, while the jury
was certainly free to reject

03:31.386 --> 03:33.153
the defense of legal insanity,

03:33.186 --> 03:36.253
Ms. Dole's actions
just as certainly fall

03:36.286 --> 03:38.320
within the scope
of heat of passion.

03:38.353 --> 03:41.586
A killer came to her door,
threatened her,

03:41.620 --> 03:42.753
and she reacted.

03:42.786 --> 03:45.353
Your Honor, can
and should find that Ms. Dole

03:45.386 --> 03:47.620
committed her act
while under the influence

03:47.653 --> 03:50.420
of extreme mental
and emotional disturbance

03:50.453 --> 03:53.220
for which there
was a reasonable excuse.

03:53.253 --> 03:56.320
This fits the classic
definition of manslaughter,

03:56.353 --> 03:58.520
not murder one, not murder two,

03:58.553 --> 04:00.260
but voluntary manslaughter.

04:00.293 --> 04:03.926
Accordingly, this verdict
is contrary to the evidence.

04:03.960 --> 04:06.493
It is contrary to the law,

04:06.526 --> 04:08.193
and I would respectfully request

04:08.226 --> 04:11.026
that you adjust the verdict
to the appropriate degree.

04:15.426 --> 04:18.560
The jury heard testimony
of how Ms. Dole threatened

04:18.593 --> 04:21.293
to kill the victim
the very day of the shooting.

04:21.760 --> 04:23.293
Those were her words.

04:23.326 --> 04:25.826
The jury heard Ms. Dole's voice
on the phone

04:25.860 --> 04:28.493
evidencing a calm demeanor,

04:28.526 --> 04:30.460
no passion whatsoever,

04:30.493 --> 04:32.493
seconds before the shooting.

04:32.526 --> 04:35.926
Personally, I've never even
seen a manslaughter with a gun.

04:35.959 --> 04:39.193
Manslaughter is usually
a fist, a vehicle,

04:39.226 --> 04:40.960
a fight, sometimes a stabbing.

04:40.993 --> 04:43.526
But when a woman walks
from her door,

04:43.560 --> 04:45.060
retrieves her purse,

04:45.093 --> 04:47.726
retrieves a handgun
from within that purse,

04:47.760 --> 04:50.626
shoots the man who is still
standing by the door,

04:50.660 --> 04:52.326
that's not manslaughter,

04:52.360 --> 04:55.660
and I will remind the court
of something you already know,

04:55.693 --> 04:58.493
you are not entitled
to simply substitute

04:58.526 --> 05:00.666
your judgment
for that of the jury's.

05:00.700 --> 05:03.166
You can only override
the first-degree conviction

05:03.200 --> 05:05.466
if you find there
is no reasonable basis for it.

05:05.500 --> 05:08.633
Here, you cannot make
such a finding.

05:09.033 --> 05:12.300
As such,
I respectfully request

05:12.333 --> 05:15.733
that you allow the jury's
verdict to stand.

05:20.200 --> 05:23.933
WEST: Ms. Dole, do you have
anything you'd like to say?

05:31.533 --> 05:34.133
I would like to express
my condolences

05:34.166 --> 05:35.900
to the family
of Lawrence O'Malley.

05:35.933 --> 05:39.200
I would also like
to assure the court

05:39.800 --> 05:42.566
the lack of remorse
I seemingly demonstrated

05:42.600 --> 05:44.766
in my phone call
to the police that night...

05:47.133 --> 05:49.900
was more a product of my shock

05:49.933 --> 05:52.900
than the person
I think and hope I am.

05:53.900 --> 05:55.700
I took a human life.

05:55.733 --> 05:57.800
I had the opportunity
to retreat.

05:57.833 --> 05:59.066
I didn't do so.

05:59.100 --> 06:02.540
I accept responsibility
for a homicide conviction.

06:02.573 --> 06:04.306
I committed a homicide,

06:05.073 --> 06:07.506
but given my shock,
and my fear,

06:07.540 --> 06:09.740
and the underlying trauma

06:09.773 --> 06:13.040
I was experiencing
from past assaults against me,

06:13.073 --> 06:15.806
I feel my judgment
and state of mind

06:15.840 --> 06:17.340
were compromised.

06:17.973 --> 06:21.506
And that the crime I'm guilty
of is more consistent

06:21.540 --> 06:23.540
with voluntary manslaughter.

06:26.873 --> 06:28.306
Thank you.

06:32.440 --> 06:37.240
(music playing)

07:22.246 --> 07:23.780
WASHINGTON: Did he say
when he would rule?

07:23.813 --> 07:24.880
DONNELL: No.

07:24.913 --> 07:26.846
It's good that he took
it under advisement.

07:26.880 --> 07:29.546
DONNELL: But bad he wouldn't
let us call witnesses.

07:29.580 --> 07:31.146
What is with the heat?

07:31.180 --> 07:32.280
You said it was being fixed.

07:32.313 --> 07:33.146
It is. It should.

07:33.180 --> 07:35.146
What the hell is wrong
with it?

07:35.180 --> 07:36.613
Do I look like a plumber?

07:36.646 --> 07:38.480
A plumber fixes water,
Rebecca.

07:38.513 --> 07:39.346
Tell me you
didn't know that.

07:39.380 --> 07:40.513
You want to get off my back,
Ellenor?

07:40.546 --> 07:41.613
What happens
when your toilet clogs,

07:41.646 --> 07:42.613
you call an electrician?

07:42.646 --> 07:44.346
My toilet never clogs,
Ellenor.

07:44.380 --> 07:45.513
Do you have that problem?

07:45.546 --> 07:46.413
What's that supposed to mean?

07:46.446 --> 07:47.746
Not a thing.
Not a thing?

07:47.780 --> 07:49.446
Only you seem a little edgy.

07:49.480 --> 07:52.613
DONNELL: Ellenor, you do seem
a little on edge.

07:52.646 --> 07:54.346
I'm hot!

07:54.380 --> 07:56.913
DONNELL: Fine.
It'll all be fixed today.

07:57.980 --> 07:59.346
We got a walk-up.

07:59.380 --> 08:00.286
Anybody?

08:00.320 --> 08:01.153
DONNELL: Jimmy.

08:01.186 --> 08:02.553
I took the last one.

08:02.586 --> 08:04.020
WASHINGTON: No, I did.

08:04.053 --> 08:05.286
Well, how about you, Ellenor?

08:05.320 --> 08:07.253
I have Jamie Stringer at 10:00,

08:07.286 --> 08:09.153
who, by the way,
you called back.

08:09.186 --> 08:11.120
Not just me. Eugene liked her.

08:11.153 --> 08:12.986
Jimmy, just take the walk-up.

08:13.020 --> 08:14.320
(sighs)

08:14.353 --> 08:15.686
It's always me.

08:17.920 --> 08:20.053
HATCHER: James Berluti,
Melissa Halpern.

08:20.086 --> 08:21.253
BERLUTI: Hi.
Hello.

08:21.286 --> 08:23.086
This is my daughter, Joey.

08:23.120 --> 08:25.153
BERLUTI: Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

08:25.186 --> 08:26.486
How can I be of help?

08:26.520 --> 08:28.920
Is there someplace you
and I could speak privately?

08:28.953 --> 08:30.120
Of course.

08:33.153 --> 08:35.453
MELISSA: I told my daughter
that this was just about

08:35.486 --> 08:37.586
insurance and so forth, but...

08:37.620 --> 08:38.620
(sighs)

08:39.486 --> 08:40.586
...that isn't it.

08:43.285 --> 08:45.253
First, I need to know

08:45.286 --> 08:47.920
that what I tell you
will remain confidential.

08:47.953 --> 08:49.120
Absolutely.

08:50.086 --> 08:51.186
Please.

08:53.286 --> 08:56.086
I wanted you to meet
my daughter to, um,

08:57.286 --> 09:00.593
well, I guess
for some perspective.

09:01.893 --> 09:04.226
Sixteen years ago,

09:04.260 --> 09:05.960
I kidnapped her.

09:07.793 --> 09:11.226
I was into drugs
and I got this inane notion

09:11.260 --> 09:13.060
that having to take care
of a child

09:13.093 --> 09:15.293
would be a kind
of a lifeline to--

09:16.726 --> 09:19.626
I just grabbed her out
of a hospital

09:19.660 --> 09:20.660
when she was a newborn,

09:20.693 --> 09:22.660
and I've been raising her
ever since.

09:23.626 --> 09:24.860
Does your daughter know?

09:24.893 --> 09:27.626
MELISSA:
No, and it's imperative

09:27.660 --> 09:29.160
that she never find out.

09:29.193 --> 09:30.626
It would destroy her.

09:30.660 --> 09:32.926
I also have two small
children, a family.

09:32.960 --> 09:35.260
I mean,
if this ever got out,

09:35.293 --> 09:37.593
many lives would be destroyed.

09:38.326 --> 09:40.760
So why are you here?

09:41.160 --> 09:42.060
Um...

09:43.026 --> 09:45.660
I recently read
a magazine article

09:45.693 --> 09:47.526
about two lives

09:47.560 --> 09:49.526
that have been destroyed
the birth mother

09:49.560 --> 09:52.026
and the woman they accused
of stealing Joey.

09:52.060 --> 09:54.126
BERLUTI: Another woman
was convicted?

09:54.160 --> 09:56.060
MELISSA: No,
they never pressed charges

09:56.093 --> 09:57.760
due to lack of evidence,
but evidently,

09:57.793 --> 10:00.400
the cloud of suspicion
followed her, and--

10:00.433 --> 10:02.033
well, the irony is
that she went on

10:02.066 --> 10:04.333
to get into some
of the same drug problems

10:04.366 --> 10:06.666
that I was looking
to escape.

10:12.133 --> 10:13.833
I don't wanna turn
myself in.

10:14.533 --> 10:17.433
It isn't an option,
but two things in this article,

10:17.466 --> 10:19.966
the birth mother,
she says the horror

10:20.000 --> 10:22.166
lives on every day
of not knowing what happened,

10:22.200 --> 10:25.133
whether her daughter
is dead or--

10:25.166 --> 10:28.266
she said that if
she could just know

10:28.300 --> 10:30.366
that her daughter
has a good life somewhere

10:30.400 --> 10:33.600
and is happy, and for
the woman who is accused,

10:33.633 --> 10:35.166
she said if even one person

10:35.200 --> 10:36.666
could know she was innocent,

10:36.700 --> 10:37.866
even one...

10:39.466 --> 10:42.566
I would like you to go
to the birth mother

10:42.600 --> 10:44.966
and tell her how happy

10:45.000 --> 10:47.200
and safe her daughter is.

10:48.266 --> 10:49.633
And then I would like you
to go to the woman

10:49.666 --> 10:52.966
who was accused and tell her
you know she's innocent.

10:53.466 --> 10:55.566
I-I have, uh...

10:56.866 --> 10:58.300
two money orders,

10:59.100 --> 11:01.206
each in the amount of $70,000.

11:01.240 --> 11:03.840
If I had more,
I would pay them more.

11:06.073 --> 11:08.473
Can you do this for me,
Mr. Berluti?

11:13.473 --> 11:17.306
FRUTT: Obviously, your academic
credentials are superb.

11:17.340 --> 11:18.706
Thank you.

11:18.740 --> 11:20.806
FRUTT: But I have to say,
I'm curious,

11:20.840 --> 11:23.740
with the offers
you're getting, why here?

11:23.773 --> 11:25.373
STRINGER: Those offers
are all civil.

11:25.406 --> 11:27.973
The only thing I've ever
wanted to do is criminal,

11:28.006 --> 11:29.873
and this firm for criminal.

11:29.906 --> 11:32.106
I've been court-buffing you
guys for two years.

11:32.140 --> 11:33.106
Really?

11:33.140 --> 11:35.540
I was at the Lindsay Dole
trial every day.

11:35.573 --> 11:36.673
I almost cut a final.

11:37.906 --> 11:40.373
Any tips? We could have used
some pointers on that one.

11:40.406 --> 11:41.973
Are you serious?

11:42.006 --> 11:45.340
Well, sure.

11:46.140 --> 11:47.540
Well, I'm sure
I couldn't say anything

11:47.573 --> 11:49.106
that you haven't
already thought about.

11:49.140 --> 11:50.473
Just for fun.

11:50.506 --> 11:51.740
Why don't you throw it out?

11:51.773 --> 11:53.206
(giggles)

11:53.240 --> 11:54.606
Feels like a test.

11:54.640 --> 11:55.740
Um...

11:56.840 --> 11:59.273
I thought it was a mistake
to go with battered woman.

11:59.306 --> 12:01.780
It may be a viable theory
technically,

12:01.813 --> 12:03.780
but juries pretty much
reject the abuse excuse.

12:03.813 --> 12:05.146
It seems desperate.

12:05.180 --> 12:06.913
I felt you cut
your legs off at the top.

12:06.946 --> 12:09.346
What else were we supposed
to argue?

12:09.380 --> 12:10.780
STRINGER:
Straight self-defense.

12:10.813 --> 12:12.213
Wink, wink.

12:12.246 --> 12:14.446
It really would have amounted
to jury nullification,

12:14.480 --> 12:16.613
but--and here's where I feel
like you really dropped

12:16.646 --> 12:17.713
the ball--

12:19.713 --> 12:20.613
I'm sorry.

12:20.646 --> 12:21.746
I-I don't mean to--

12:21.780 --> 12:23.480
No, go ahead.

12:23.513 --> 12:26.913
What you did was characterize
Lindsay as a crazy.

12:26.946 --> 12:28.980
You know, she snapped,
she was outside of herself,

12:29.013 --> 12:31.246
she lost control,
but the problem is

12:31.280 --> 12:32.780
juries don't like
to free nutsos.

12:32.813 --> 12:34.780
Instead of depicting
her as aberrant,

12:34.813 --> 12:36.313
you should have portrayed her
as every woman.

12:36.346 --> 12:37.713
You know, who wouldn't
pull the trigger

12:37.746 --> 12:39.046
if the guy comes
to her house?

12:39.080 --> 12:40.613
We sort of did that.

12:40.646 --> 12:42.446
STRINGER: Not enough,
you didn't.

12:42.980 --> 12:44.846
You basically argued
we can't know

12:44.880 --> 12:45.613
what it's like to be her.

12:45.646 --> 12:47.013
She was in a different place,

12:47.046 --> 12:49.446
but I would have put
the jury right in her shoes,

12:49.480 --> 12:50.946
right in that place.

12:50.980 --> 12:52.646
At least one of them would
have pulled the trigger.

12:52.680 --> 12:54.413
The worst you get
is a hung jury.

12:57.180 --> 12:59.420
Hindsight's always 20/20.

12:59.453 --> 13:00.720
I-I know.

13:15.120 --> 13:16.753
(doorbell rings)

13:23.753 --> 13:24.653
Hi.

13:24.686 --> 13:26.253
I'm looking for Sally Burns.

13:26.286 --> 13:27.553
I'm Sally.

13:27.586 --> 13:29.420
My name
is James Berluti.

13:30.786 --> 13:32.153
I, uh...

13:33.286 --> 13:35.253
I represent the individual

13:35.286 --> 13:38.020
who kidnapped your daughter
16 years ago.

13:39.120 --> 13:42.820
I'm not at liberty to divulge
this individual's name,

13:42.853 --> 13:47.353
but this person hired me
to communicate to you

13:47.386 --> 13:50.753
that your daughter
is safe and happy.

13:51.453 --> 13:54.853
The individual continues
to parent your daughter.

13:54.886 --> 13:57.453
The individual feels
great remorse

13:57.486 --> 13:59.626
for all the pain
caused to you,

13:59.660 --> 14:02.093
and sends to you
this money order

14:02.126 --> 14:04.326
in the amount of $70,000.

14:05.226 --> 14:07.126
The individual
wants you to know

14:07.160 --> 14:10.326
that he or she is very sorry

14:10.360 --> 14:12.093
for hurting you.

14:13.226 --> 14:15.326
That's all
I'm at liberty to say.

14:16.360 --> 14:20.293
(music playing)

14:44.893 --> 14:46.560
What didn't you like
about her?

14:46.593 --> 14:47.726
I don't know.

14:47.760 --> 14:48.993
I just didn't.

14:49.026 --> 14:50.093
You see her transcript?

14:50.126 --> 14:51.226
FRUTT: Yeah, her grades
were great.

14:51.260 --> 14:52.393
That's why we
interviewed her.

14:52.426 --> 14:53.993
But the purpose
of the interview is to see

14:54.026 --> 14:55.793
if we like her and I didn't.

14:55.826 --> 14:59.060
Bec, I want you
to interview her.

14:59.093 --> 15:00.166
FRUTT: Why?

15:00.200 --> 15:02.066
Hiring is supposed
to be unanimous.

15:02.100 --> 15:03.133
If I didn't like her--

15:03.166 --> 15:05.000
We're also supposed
to have a group discussion.

15:05.033 --> 15:06.600
Rebecca is part of the group.

15:06.633 --> 15:07.766
She needs to interview her.

15:07.800 --> 15:09.433
I thought she was great.

15:09.466 --> 15:11.633
Yes, all the men think
she's swell.

15:11.666 --> 15:13.266
Why are you so testy?

15:15.400 --> 15:16.433
Hey.

15:16.466 --> 15:17.833
What's wrong?

15:18.433 --> 15:20.300
What, I can't just pop in
to say hi?

15:20.333 --> 15:21.666
What's wrong?

15:22.266 --> 15:23.066
Jimmy...

15:24.466 --> 15:26.166
police got a visit
from a woman

15:26.200 --> 15:28.233
named Sally Burns
last night.

15:31.900 --> 15:34.100
You had to know she'd go
to the police.

15:34.133 --> 15:35.100
So what?

15:35.133 --> 15:36.400
It's attorney/client.

15:36.433 --> 15:37.600
GAMBLE: Not necessarily.

15:37.633 --> 15:39.066
A crime is ongoing.

15:39.100 --> 15:40.033
BERLUTI: What crime?

15:40.066 --> 15:41.033
The kidnapping!

15:41.066 --> 15:42.633
The individual
still has her.

15:42.666 --> 15:44.166
The crime is ongoing, Jimmy,

15:44.200 --> 15:46.100
which means you can reveal.

15:46.133 --> 15:48.700
Helen, I'm not going to tell.

15:48.733 --> 15:50.933
You know
I'm not going to tell.

15:54.133 --> 15:55.433
What?

15:55.466 --> 15:58.133
GAMBLE: I'm going to get
a judge to force you to tell.

15:58.166 --> 16:00.473
No judge is ever--
I think you're wrong.

16:02.206 --> 16:04.473
We already know
who she is,

16:04.506 --> 16:07.473
Bernice White,
56 years old,

16:07.506 --> 16:09.940
works as a waitress
at the King Street Cafe.

16:09.973 --> 16:11.440
We'll get her one way
or another.

16:11.473 --> 16:14.706
If she comes forward
and cooperates,

16:14.740 --> 16:16.340
I'll give her three years.

16:17.173 --> 16:19.140
You have 24 hours.

16:28.073 --> 16:29.173
(door closes)

16:31.173 --> 16:32.606
MELISSA: You can't tell.

16:32.640 --> 16:34.140
You gave me your word!
BERLUTI: Listen--

16:34.173 --> 16:35.640
I didn't even want you
to tell him!

16:35.673 --> 16:36.640
He's a lawyer here.

16:36.673 --> 16:38.073
The privilege extends
to all.

16:38.106 --> 16:40.006
And now you're breaking
the privilege!

16:40.040 --> 16:41.506
Nobody's revealing
your secret.

16:41.540 --> 16:42.540
What are you telling me?!

16:42.573 --> 16:43.573
YOUNG: We're telling you
the D. A.

16:43.606 --> 16:46.206
is trying to force us
to reveal your identity.

16:46.240 --> 16:47.806
If she is successful--
MELISSA: Oh, my God!

16:47.840 --> 16:49.140
Oh, my God!

16:49.173 --> 16:50.706
YOUNG: Melissa,
you need to calm down here.

16:50.740 --> 16:52.273
MELISSA: I just wanted
to help those people!

16:52.306 --> 16:54.140
I did not wanna risk jail!

16:54.173 --> 16:56.506
I can leave the room
and come back later

16:56.540 --> 16:59.380
or you can calm down
and listen to me now.

17:00.146 --> 17:01.780
We are not going
to give you up.

17:01.813 --> 17:02.580
You need to be aware--

17:03.613 --> 17:04.680
Melissa.

17:06.780 --> 17:09.512
Melissa, I need your full
attention now.

17:11.380 --> 17:13.680
You asked Mr. Berluti
to contact the woman

17:13.713 --> 17:15.280
accused of the kidnapping.

17:15.313 --> 17:17.012
Which I've been trying to do,

17:17.046 --> 17:18.413
but I haven't got her yet.

17:18.445 --> 17:20.346
YOUNG: It is our opinion
that we should no longer

17:20.380 --> 17:22.780
try to contact her,
and here's why,

17:22.813 --> 17:24.445
they still think she's it.

17:24.480 --> 17:27.380
If we contact her,
we'd effectively be telling

17:27.413 --> 17:29.580
the police, "It's not her.
Could be anybody."

17:30.846 --> 17:32.180
For your protection,

17:32.213 --> 17:35.680
it's best that
she remains a suspect.

17:36.580 --> 17:37.980
I know you wanted to help,

17:38.013 --> 17:39.980
but there's too much
risk in it.

17:41.313 --> 17:42.613
Okay.

17:42.646 --> 17:45.980
YOUNG: I also wanted to open up
a bogus file for you

17:46.013 --> 17:48.246
on the chance the police
are watching this building

17:48.280 --> 17:50.080
to see who goes in and out,

17:50.113 --> 17:52.580
and the chances
are good they are.

17:52.613 --> 17:55.413
I want a file explaining
your presence here.

17:55.446 --> 17:58.046
We can create something
under estate planning.

17:59.620 --> 18:00.786
I have small children.

18:00.820 --> 18:02.720
I cannot go to jail.

18:02.753 --> 18:06.586
Melissa, we are not gonna
let that happen.

18:13.253 --> 18:14.086
Hi.

18:14.786 --> 18:15.720
Hey.

18:15.753 --> 18:17.320
Rebecca will be right
with you.

18:17.353 --> 18:18.386
STRINGER: Great.

18:18.420 --> 18:21.853
I can't believe I even got
called back again after...

18:22.686 --> 18:24.086
What happened?

18:24.120 --> 18:26.953
Well, my mouth tends
to disclose

18:26.986 --> 18:29.786
what I think sometimes,
and, well,

18:29.820 --> 18:31.520
I may have offended
Ms. Frutt.

18:31.553 --> 18:33.353
Ah, don't worry about it.

18:33.386 --> 18:34.720
I offended them
when I walked in the door.

18:34.753 --> 18:36.386
I didn't think
I'd last a week.

18:36.420 --> 18:37.486
That was four years ago.

18:37.986 --> 18:39.153
WASHINGTON: Hi, Jamie?

18:39.186 --> 18:41.086
Yes.
Rebecca Washington.

18:41.120 --> 18:42.253
Very nice to meet you.

18:42.286 --> 18:44.353
You too.
We can go in here.

18:45.120 --> 18:46.020
Ms. Frutt, hello.

18:46.786 --> 18:47.786
Hi.

18:50.220 --> 18:52.620
HATCHER: Oh, Jimmy,
this is Bernice White.

18:52.653 --> 18:54.086
She says
you've been calling her.

18:54.120 --> 18:57.486
(music playing)

18:59.960 --> 19:01.993
Yes. Yes.

19:02.026 --> 19:03.160
James Berluti.

19:03.193 --> 19:04.160
Thanks for coming.

19:04.193 --> 19:06.526
What's this about?
Did I inherit something?

19:06.560 --> 19:09.726
BERLUTI: Actually,
we thought you did,

19:09.760 --> 19:11.660
but it was another
Bernice White.

19:13.026 --> 19:13.960
I'm very sorry.

19:13.993 --> 19:15.593
What'd she get?

19:15.626 --> 19:16.693
Sorry?

19:16.726 --> 19:18.026
This other Bernice White.

19:18.060 --> 19:19.093
What'd she inherit?

19:19.126 --> 19:21.493
Oh, only a few hundred
dollars, actually.

19:21.526 --> 19:22.460
Nothing.

19:22.493 --> 19:24.526
You sure made it sound
a lot more important

19:24.560 --> 19:26.160
than a few hundred dollars.

19:26.193 --> 19:27.793
Again, I apologize.

19:39.626 --> 19:40.860
What's wrong?

19:43.060 --> 19:44.293
Nothing.

19:46.260 --> 19:47.593
What's wrong with you?

19:50.693 --> 19:51.893
(sighs)

19:51.926 --> 19:53.293
Nothing.

19:53.326 --> 19:55.093
So here we are then,

19:55.626 --> 19:57.726
two people with nothing wrong.

20:01.266 --> 20:02.533
Did I blow it?

20:03.500 --> 20:04.566
Blow what?

20:06.600 --> 20:07.633
Lindsay's trial.

20:07.666 --> 20:08.933
Ellenor...

20:08.966 --> 20:10.366
FRUTT: That Hinks
stuff with you

20:10.400 --> 20:11.200
never should have come in.

20:11.233 --> 20:12.533
You objected.

20:12.566 --> 20:14.366
I objected once
for the record.

20:14.400 --> 20:15.966
I should have shut it down.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.366
Look--
Abuse defenses,

20:17.400 --> 20:19.400
statistically, are losers.

20:19.433 --> 20:21.400
We had to have something.

20:21.433 --> 20:23.433
FRUTT: Battered woman
syndrome is desperate.

20:23.466 --> 20:25.666
Even a third year law
student knows that.

20:25.700 --> 20:28.300
This was a team defense.

20:28.333 --> 20:30.466
FRUTT: But I tried it.
I was the one up there.

20:30.500 --> 20:33.366
Come on, a serial killer
with a restraining order?

20:33.400 --> 20:35.200
How could I not win?

20:35.233 --> 20:38.200
We have all won with much,
much less!

20:38.233 --> 20:39.433
Where is this coming from?

20:39.466 --> 20:42.300
That little slut Rebecca
is interviewing.

20:43.933 --> 20:46.066
She picked me to pieces

20:46.733 --> 20:47.866
and she was right.

20:49.733 --> 20:52.766
We focused the jury
on Lindsay being crazy

20:52.800 --> 20:54.466
when we should have argued

20:54.500 --> 20:56.666
how reasonable she was.

20:57.466 --> 20:59.140
How could I not have seen it?

20:59.173 --> 21:01.573
None of us saw it.

21:01.606 --> 21:04.740
FRUTT: Why?
How could we all--

21:05.273 --> 21:06.906
I think Lindsay was desperate

21:06.940 --> 21:08.506
to believe she snapped.

21:09.440 --> 21:11.106
She was desperate
to believe

21:11.140 --> 21:13.073
she was crazy, Ellenor,

21:13.640 --> 21:16.906
so we became desperate
to help her believe it.

21:21.773 --> 21:23.706
You didn't pull
the trigger, Ellenor.

21:28.173 --> 21:30.273
It's good talking to you,
Bobby.

21:32.040 --> 21:34.406
You remember years ago,
we used to come in here

21:34.440 --> 21:35.773
at the end of the day

21:37.440 --> 21:39.673
and we would just talk.

21:42.906 --> 21:44.473
What happened?

21:44.840 --> 21:46.106
FRUTT: I don't know.

21:47.106 --> 21:49.673
You have become a bit
of an island, Bobby.

21:50.540 --> 21:52.373
You don't turn to others,

21:52.406 --> 21:53.940
even in your times of...

21:58.673 --> 22:00.313
I've tried to be there.

22:03.746 --> 22:04.946
For her.

22:07.246 --> 22:08.613
For all of you.

22:09.913 --> 22:11.580
That isn't exactly it.

22:12.513 --> 22:15.180
You're there
when we need you, Bobby,

22:16.946 --> 22:19.780
but we all get a little
desperate from time to time

22:21.313 --> 22:23.046
for you to need us.

22:35.885 --> 22:38.618
Look, it's a very tough thing
we're asking for,

22:38.651 --> 22:39.951
attorney/client privilege.

22:39.985 --> 22:41.485
SALLY: He knows
where she is.

22:41.518 --> 22:43.951
She's alive, Ms. Gamble
and this lawyer knows.

22:43.985 --> 22:44.685
He knows--
GAMBLE: Sally,

22:44.718 --> 22:46.718
you have to understand.

22:46.985 --> 22:50.285
Legal ethics and morality
are two different things.

22:50.318 --> 22:51.351
Sometimes they fly

22:51.385 --> 22:53.785
in the absolute face
of each other.

22:53.818 --> 22:54.718
(knock on door)

22:54.751 --> 22:56.451
Helen,

22:56.985 --> 22:58.051
I'm sorry.

22:58.885 --> 23:00.491
Can I talk to you
for a second?

23:00.525 --> 23:01.858
I'm kind of
in the middle of something.

23:01.891 --> 23:02.925
Please.

23:04.825 --> 23:05.991
Could you give me
a minute?

23:14.858 --> 23:16.525
(door closes)

23:16.558 --> 23:18.725
Look, I'm not gonna fight you
on the merits

23:18.758 --> 23:20.325
of what you're trying
to do here.

23:20.358 --> 23:21.425
Good.

23:21.958 --> 23:23.991
But I'm asking you
to hold off.

23:24.025 --> 23:27.158
If it gets out our firm
is helping a kidnapper to--

23:28.091 --> 23:30.258
Helen,
you know the fallout.

23:30.291 --> 23:32.925
It might not necessarily
affect Lindsay's disposition,

23:32.958 --> 23:34.558
but we do not need
Judge West

23:34.591 --> 23:37.458
getting angry at us
about something else.

23:37.491 --> 23:38.458
I doubt this
would have any bearing

23:38.491 --> 23:39.658
on Lindsay's fate.

23:39.691 --> 23:41.591
But with the possibility

23:41.625 --> 23:43.525
it could,

23:43.558 --> 23:44.658
please.

23:47.291 --> 23:49.058
When's he supposed to rule?

23:49.791 --> 23:50.991
11:00.

23:52.358 --> 23:54.725
I'll push my motion
to this afternoon.

23:55.391 --> 23:56.525
Thank you.

23:58.491 --> 23:59.658
Thank you.

24:04.498 --> 24:05.431
(door opens)

24:06.465 --> 24:08.398
Bobby likes her,
as do I,

24:08.431 --> 24:10.098
and Rebecca and Jimmy.

24:10.131 --> 24:12.198
What exactly bothered you
about her?

24:12.231 --> 24:13.265
FRUTT: I don't know.

24:13.298 --> 24:15.365
She seemed perky,

24:15.398 --> 24:16.931
suck-uppy, arrogant.

24:16.965 --> 24:18.731
Perky, suck-uppy,
arrogant.

24:18.765 --> 24:20.365
Maybe it's that
Harvard thing.

24:20.398 --> 24:22.898
Look, given our current
state of things,

24:22.931 --> 24:24.131
the Harvard grads
aren't exactly

24:24.165 --> 24:25.998
flooding us
with their resumes.

24:26.031 --> 24:28.531
This is a real prospect,
Ellenor, I--

24:28.565 --> 24:30.931
You didn't find her
a little slutty?

24:30.965 --> 24:32.431
Slutty?
FRUTT: Yes,

24:32.465 --> 24:35.431
she's got that giggly,
flirty thing.

24:35.465 --> 24:37.365
WASHINGTON: So now
she's a giggly, flirty,

24:37.398 --> 24:39.231
suck-uppy, arrogant slut?

24:39.265 --> 24:41.165
FRUTT: Look, I'm sure
she's a great person.

24:41.198 --> 24:42.898
She's obviously
very smart.

24:42.931 --> 24:44.865
I just didn't get
a great hit,

24:44.898 --> 24:45.765
that's all.

24:46.165 --> 24:47.865
Seeing as
the rest of us did

24:47.898 --> 24:50.031
and we need to hire,

24:50.065 --> 24:51.565
I vote we extend an offer.

24:51.598 --> 24:52.665
Me too.

24:52.698 --> 24:53.765
Me too.

24:55.631 --> 24:56.598
Okay.

24:56.631 --> 24:58.365
(footsteps approach)

25:00.065 --> 25:01.238
It's quarter to 11:00.

25:01.271 --> 25:04.271
(music playing)

25:22.138 --> 25:23.171
How you doing?

25:23.205 --> 25:24.805
I'll let you know.

25:24.838 --> 25:26.905
BAILIFF: All rise.

25:26.938 --> 25:28.005
This court is in session.

25:28.038 --> 25:30.471
The honorable Judge West
presides.

25:35.771 --> 25:36.671
Be seated.

25:44.371 --> 25:46.405
First, let me state
for the record

25:46.438 --> 25:50.105
my disfavor
for the legal gamesmanship.

25:50.138 --> 25:52.305
For the defense to argue

25:52.338 --> 25:53.738
diminished capacity

25:53.771 --> 25:55.138
then to lose,

25:55.171 --> 25:57.171
only then to march
into sentencing

25:57.205 --> 25:59.438
claiming it was manslaughter,

25:59.471 --> 26:01.945
it strikes me
as a disingenuous attempt

26:01.978 --> 26:04.245
to have two bites
at the legal apple.

26:04.911 --> 26:06.611
That having been said,

26:06.645 --> 26:10.411
I am required to consider
this second bite,

26:10.445 --> 26:13.078
and as I view
the evidence,

26:13.111 --> 26:14.645
this case warrants a finding

26:14.678 --> 26:16.411
of voluntary manslaughter

26:16.445 --> 26:18.111
more than murder one.

26:18.645 --> 26:20.245
Had I been sitting
on the jury,

26:20.278 --> 26:22.678
I most definitely
would have voted that way.

26:24.478 --> 26:27.178
But I wasn't a juror
in this case.

26:27.211 --> 26:28.878
I am the judge,

26:30.378 --> 26:33.711
and as the prosecutor
correctly points out,

26:33.745 --> 26:37.078
a judge should only
overturn a verdict

26:37.111 --> 26:41.078
if he finds
no reasonable basis for it.

26:42.511 --> 26:44.278
I can't make that leap.

26:45.845 --> 26:48.645
I therefore
uphold the verdict.

26:48.678 --> 26:50.345
Ms. Dole, you have been
convicted of murder

26:50.378 --> 26:51.945
in the first degree.

26:52.311 --> 26:54.711
I am bound by the statute
to sentence you

26:54.745 --> 26:56.611
to the Framingham
Correction Facility

26:56.645 --> 26:59.078
for the remainder
of your natural life.

26:59.645 --> 27:01.151
We are adjourned.

27:01.185 --> 27:02.118
(gavel bangs)

27:12.451 --> 27:13.851
We have a strong appeal.

27:13.885 --> 27:15.751
We have solid issues,
Lindsay.

27:15.785 --> 27:17.785
We got strong grounds.

27:17.818 --> 27:20.285
We go before the state
supreme court next week.

27:23.785 --> 27:25.518
We are going
to get you out.

27:25.551 --> 27:28.485
(music playing)

28:03.191 --> 28:04.625
(phone rings)

28:11.025 --> 28:12.458
(door opens)

28:18.258 --> 28:19.025
(door closes)

28:25.091 --> 28:26.725
She's holding up.

28:28.958 --> 28:32.091
She's going to be transferred
tomorrow afternoon.

28:32.125 --> 28:34.125
I'm gonna go back
and be with her till then.

28:39.158 --> 28:41.391
Ellenor and I
were talking last night,

28:45.591 --> 28:49.058
and she thought
it'd be a good idea for me--

28:54.758 --> 28:57.258
for me to lean on
all of you,

28:58.958 --> 29:00.298
a little more,

29:02.765 --> 29:03.865
personally.

29:12.065 --> 29:14.198
I think I'll probably
be doing that.

29:24.265 --> 29:26.165
(door opens and closes)

29:26.198 --> 29:26.865
YOUNG: Jimmy,

29:28.431 --> 29:29.398
we better go.

29:56.831 --> 29:58.598
We will survive this.

30:01.338 --> 30:02.838
You'll survive it

30:04.105 --> 30:06.671
and Lindsay will.

30:10.371 --> 30:11.838
I know.

30:12.271 --> 30:14.505
Bobby, I know you know.

30:15.871 --> 30:19.371
Factuals and legals aside,

30:19.405 --> 30:21.405
the emotional
undercurrents

30:21.438 --> 30:23.071
of a case play a part

30:23.105 --> 30:25.771
with juries, with judges,

30:25.805 --> 30:27.938
even Supreme Court justices.

30:27.971 --> 30:31.038
You know that better
than anybody, right?

30:33.905 --> 30:35.371
Bobby, look at me.

30:38.705 --> 30:40.638
Give me this appeal.

30:42.671 --> 30:44.305
I'll bring your wife home.

30:45.871 --> 30:48.505
(music playing)

31:06.445 --> 31:07.978
The identity
of a client

31:08.011 --> 31:09.711
has never been privileged,
Your Honor.

31:09.745 --> 31:12.045
It has when the disclosure
of the identity

31:12.078 --> 31:13.978
would incriminate
a person criminally.

31:14.011 --> 31:15.678
Hold on a second,
Mr. Berluti.

31:15.711 --> 31:18.245
Assuming your client
enjoys privilege,

31:18.278 --> 31:20.578
so what?
We've got a crime here.

31:20.611 --> 31:21.678
Person has been
kidnapped.

31:21.711 --> 31:23.911
She could be
in severe physical danger.

31:23.945 --> 31:24.845
She's not in danger.

31:24.878 --> 31:26.811
KITTLESON:
Says who? The kidnapper?

31:26.845 --> 31:28.445
I've seen her.
She's healthy--

31:28.478 --> 31:29.978
KITTLESON: Careful, counsel.

31:30.011 --> 31:31.911
You're about to make
yourself a witness.

31:31.945 --> 31:33.511
Your Honor,
as you correctly imply,

31:33.545 --> 31:35.411
this is an
ongoing crime.

31:35.445 --> 31:38.345
Mr. Berluti has knowledge
as to who has the victim.

31:38.378 --> 31:39.345
BERLUTI:
This is a past crime.

31:39.378 --> 31:40.978
It happened 16 years ago.

31:41.011 --> 31:42.678
GAMBLE: It happens every day.

31:42.711 --> 31:44.311
The girl is still
being held.

31:44.345 --> 31:45.511
She's not being held.

31:45.545 --> 31:47.745
She doesn't even know
she's kidnapped.

31:47.778 --> 31:49.245
My client has been
her parent--

31:49.278 --> 31:50.978
GAMBLE: Oh, come on,
if a kidnapper

31:51.011 --> 31:52.311
went to a lawyer

31:52.345 --> 31:53.678
for the purpose
of eluding capture,

31:53.711 --> 31:55.145
there's no doubt

31:55.178 --> 31:57.578
we would consider that
an ongoing case.

31:57.611 --> 31:59.178
That's not
what's going on here.

31:59.211 --> 32:00.818
Are you sure?

32:00.851 --> 32:02.151
She says she wants
to help the victim.

32:02.185 --> 32:03.885
Maybe she's clever.

32:03.918 --> 32:05.585
Maybe she is using you

32:05.618 --> 32:07.851
to check the status
of the investigation.

32:07.885 --> 32:09.085
She's not doing that.

32:09.118 --> 32:10.551
You say so.
We don't know.

32:10.585 --> 32:12.718
The point is
it shouldn't matter.

32:12.751 --> 32:14.818
Sally Burns' daughter
is still out there

32:14.851 --> 32:17.718
in the hands of the person
who took her.

32:17.751 --> 32:19.585
That's present tense,
Your Honor.

32:19.618 --> 32:21.551
This is an ongoing case.

32:21.585 --> 32:22.751
Attorney/client privilege--

32:22.785 --> 32:24.218
BERLUTI:
Even if she's right,

32:24.251 --> 32:26.251
that would give me the choice
to break privilege.

32:26.285 --> 32:28.851
It would not incur an obligation
on my part to do so.

32:28.885 --> 32:30.551
If a person is in danger--

32:30.585 --> 32:32.118
I have no knowledge
or belief

32:32.151 --> 32:34.085
that any bodily harm
would ensue.

32:34.118 --> 32:36.751
I don't have to break privilege
and I won't.

32:36.785 --> 32:38.685
And I submit to this court

32:38.718 --> 32:41.218
in close cases
and this would be one,

32:41.251 --> 32:43.385
the doubt
has to be resolved

32:43.418 --> 32:44.918
in favor of the client.

32:44.951 --> 32:47.518
If not,
what are we left with?

32:47.551 --> 32:48.951
We can't have clients thinking

32:48.985 --> 32:51.151
privilege is vulnerable.

32:51.185 --> 32:52.585
When a person
goes to a lawyer,

32:52.618 --> 32:54.318
he or she has to know

32:54.351 --> 32:56.918
this confidentiality
will be upheld.

32:56.951 --> 32:58.751
Murderers get that privilege.

32:58.785 --> 33:02.391
Rapists, hijackers,
they all get that privilege.

33:02.425 --> 33:03.791
Kidnappers do, too.

33:03.825 --> 33:06.191
GAMBLE: Your Honor,
I'd prefer to focus

33:06.225 --> 33:08.558
on the rights
of the kidnap victim here,

33:08.591 --> 33:11.391
who is still suffering--
BERLUTI: She's not suffering!

33:11.425 --> 33:12.658
KITTLESON: All right.

33:12.691 --> 33:14.825
Ms. Gamble,
from a moral standpoint,

33:14.858 --> 33:16.058
I'm with you.

33:17.225 --> 33:19.491
Ms. Burns,
speaking as a mother,

33:19.525 --> 33:21.725
I can certainly
feel for you,

33:23.291 --> 33:24.258
but as a judge,

33:24.291 --> 33:26.391
I have to side
with Mr. Berluti.

33:26.425 --> 33:29.758
Attorney/client privilege
is sacrosanct.

33:29.791 --> 33:32.491
It is paramount
to our system of justice.

33:32.525 --> 33:35.325
The Commonwealth's
petition is denied.

33:35.358 --> 33:36.758
We're adjourned.

33:39.025 --> 33:40.491
SALLY: How can you do this?

33:40.525 --> 33:41.391
Ma'am?

33:41.425 --> 33:44.558
She stole my daughter!

33:44.591 --> 33:45.658
She has my daughter!

33:45.691 --> 33:46.858
How can you do this?

33:46.891 --> 33:47.591
Ms. Burns--

33:47.625 --> 33:49.425
You have no conscience!

33:49.458 --> 33:50.291
GAMBLE: Okay, Sally.

33:50.325 --> 33:51.991
SALLY:
I want my daughter back!

33:52.025 --> 33:54.491
GAMBLE: Sally--
SALLY: I want my daughter.

34:08.130 --> 34:10.665
I would have thought
they'd be open by 9:00.

34:15.965 --> 34:17.565
Are you a client?

34:17.598 --> 34:19.398
No.

34:19.431 --> 34:20.197
Are you?

34:20.231 --> 34:21.898
Oh, no.

34:21.931 --> 34:22.965
I'm a lawyer.

34:22.998 --> 34:25.998
Actually hoping
to get a job here.

34:26.031 --> 34:27.931
They keep bringing me in
for all these call backs.

34:27.965 --> 34:29.764
I'm about
to pull my hair out.

34:29.797 --> 34:31.465
Is this considered
a good place to work?

34:31.498 --> 34:32.931
Oh, excellent.

34:32.965 --> 34:33.797
It's one of the top three

34:33.831 --> 34:35.364
criminal practices
in the state.

34:36.331 --> 34:38.697
The place to come
if you're a criminal, huh?

34:39.398 --> 34:41.465
Well, that's one way
to look at it, I guess.

34:56.764 --> 34:59.605
I'm a pretty good judge
of character, Mr. Berluti.

35:01.171 --> 35:02.805
You strike me

35:02.838 --> 35:04.905
as a decent man.

35:05.338 --> 35:07.505
I can't have
this conversation.

35:07.538 --> 35:10.705
Do you believe in God,
Mr. Berluti?

35:11.005 --> 35:12.871
Ms. Burns,

35:12.905 --> 35:15.605
I represent a person
with interests

35:15.638 --> 35:18.138
contrary to yours.

35:18.171 --> 35:20.005
It would be
unethical for me

35:20.038 --> 35:22.205
to have any dialog
with you.

35:23.105 --> 35:25.038
Can you tell me

35:26.971 --> 35:28.905
what my daughter
looks like?

35:30.871 --> 35:31.905
No.

35:33.571 --> 35:36.238
Can you tell me

35:36.271 --> 35:37.805
whether or not

35:37.838 --> 35:39.738
she's a good person?

35:40.438 --> 35:42.271
I don't really know her,

35:42.305 --> 35:44.005
but she struck me

35:44.038 --> 35:46.038
as an excellent person.

35:58.305 --> 35:59.271
Rebecca?

35:59.305 --> 36:00.978
Eugene and I
talked about it.

36:01.011 --> 36:02.378
We both agree.

36:02.411 --> 36:05.611
She probably exudes
the most moral integrity,

36:05.645 --> 36:07.445
I think passion, too.

36:07.478 --> 36:09.645
Our grounds are good,

36:09.678 --> 36:11.911
but we're not going to win
unless the justices,

36:11.945 --> 36:14.011
for some reason,
want us to.

36:14.045 --> 36:16.278
So Bec's passion, I think,

36:16.311 --> 36:17.778
is our best strength.

36:19.011 --> 36:20.078
Okay.

36:22.478 --> 36:24.211
Listen,
I thought about, um,

36:25.711 --> 36:27.345
bringing Bobby here
to say

36:27.378 --> 36:29.745
goodbye because, you know,

36:30.778 --> 36:34.045
I didn't want him
to see you all shackled.

36:36.411 --> 36:38.711
Yeah.

36:38.745 --> 36:40.045
When?

36:40.078 --> 36:41.745
2:00.

36:41.778 --> 36:42.945
After his nap.

36:43.578 --> 36:44.778
Okay.

36:48.278 --> 36:50.278
I'm never going to get out,
am I, Bobby?

36:55.611 --> 36:57.145
Of course you will.

37:06.451 --> 37:07.384
I got the job?

37:07.418 --> 37:08.551
Congratulations.

37:08.584 --> 37:10.584
STRINGER:
Oh, I don't believe it!

37:10.618 --> 37:12.384
I was so sure
I offended you.

37:12.418 --> 37:13.418
Me?

37:13.451 --> 37:14.551
Get out of town.

37:14.584 --> 37:15.884
When do I start?

37:15.918 --> 37:16.884
When can you start?

37:16.918 --> 37:18.818
STRINGER: Hello?
How about yesterday?

37:18.851 --> 37:20.785
Does yesterday
work for you?

37:20.818 --> 37:22.885
I think she's excited.

37:22.918 --> 37:24.085
STRINGER: Oh, God.

37:24.118 --> 37:26.351
I need to call my parents.

37:28.151 --> 37:29.051
Oh!

37:31.218 --> 37:32.685
What's going on?

37:32.718 --> 37:34.385
Ms. White--
BERNICE: No, never mind that.

37:34.418 --> 37:35.918
What's wrong?
What's wrong?

37:35.951 --> 37:36.818
First,
you're calling me

37:36.851 --> 37:39.218
saying it's really important
that we meet

37:39.251 --> 37:40.585
and then I see you
on television

37:40.618 --> 37:44.351
concerning a crime that I have
been suspected of for 16 years.

37:44.918 --> 37:46.851
So I'm asking you again,
Mr. Berluti,

37:46.885 --> 37:48.951
what the hell is going on?

37:48.985 --> 37:51.618
Bernice White, please place
your hands behind your back.

37:51.651 --> 37:53.085
BERNICE: What?
McGUIRE: You're under arrest

37:53.118 --> 37:54.618
for kidnapping.
Hold on a second.

37:54.651 --> 37:55.918
Jimmy--
I just wanna know

37:55.951 --> 37:56.751
what's going on.

37:56.785 --> 37:58.385
We're arresting
your client, Jimmy.

37:58.418 --> 37:59.285
No, I'm not
his client!

37:59.318 --> 38:00.558
Tell them
I'm not your client!

38:00.591 --> 38:01.625
She--
YOUNG: We neither confirm

38:01.658 --> 38:03.058
nor deny that
she is our client.

38:03.091 --> 38:04.558
What? Tell them!

38:04.591 --> 38:07.225
We neither confirm
nor deny she is our client.

38:07.258 --> 38:08.358
Take her.

38:08.391 --> 38:09.591
No, I didn't do anything!

38:09.625 --> 38:10.758
I didn't do anything!

38:10.791 --> 38:12.458
These people called me!

38:12.491 --> 38:14.091
Tell them!

38:16.391 --> 38:17.925
Eugene, we can't--

38:17.958 --> 38:19.791
Jimmy, my office.

38:32.125 --> 38:33.758
By denying
she's our client,

38:33.791 --> 38:35.291
we betray
Melissa Halpern.

38:35.325 --> 38:38.291
Eugene, they basically
just arrested that woman

38:38.325 --> 38:40.258
for entering our offices.

38:40.291 --> 38:42.391
I was the one
who called her down here.

38:42.425 --> 38:43.291
That is
an unfortunate result,

38:43.325 --> 38:44.758
but we can't change it.

38:44.791 --> 38:46.425
We continue to honor
the privilege.

38:46.458 --> 38:47.958
We say nothing.

38:49.225 --> 38:51.091
That woman will be
on the news tonight

38:51.125 --> 38:52.891
pegged for the crime again!

38:52.925 --> 38:56.191
Jimmy,
she's not our client!

39:01.431 --> 39:04.065
DOLE: Okay. What about that?

39:04.098 --> 39:05.365
It's kind of hard to tell.
What is that one?

39:05.398 --> 39:06.431
(babbles)

39:06.465 --> 39:07.598
Silly.

39:07.631 --> 39:09.631
No, blue!

39:10.165 --> 39:12.765
DOLE: What if we put blue

39:12.798 --> 39:15.265
and yellow...

39:15.298 --> 39:16.631
together?

39:16.665 --> 39:17.965
What does that make?

39:17.998 --> 39:19.065
Red.

39:19.098 --> 39:20.365
Silly.

39:20.398 --> 39:21.298
Green.

39:21.331 --> 39:22.265
DOLE: That's right.

39:22.298 --> 39:24.065
You've got it.

39:24.098 --> 39:25.765
The rainbow.

39:25.798 --> 39:27.865
BOBBY: I want that, too.

39:32.398 --> 39:33.565
Okay.

39:36.031 --> 39:37.898
Okay, mommy's gotta go now.

39:37.931 --> 39:39.231
No.

39:39.265 --> 39:42.031
I'm gonna go...

39:42.065 --> 39:44.331
live in a different place
for a while,

39:45.031 --> 39:48.298
but you're gonna visit me
all the time,

39:48.931 --> 39:51.765
just like we talked about,
okay?

39:55.565 --> 39:56.831
I need a hug.

39:56.865 --> 39:58.331
Can I have a hug?

39:58.365 --> 40:00.371
Just a little,
itty-bitty hug?

40:04.238 --> 40:05.605
I love you so much.

40:06.705 --> 40:09.638
(music playing)

40:15.871 --> 40:17.105
Get me out.

40:18.238 --> 40:21.071
Please get me out.

40:21.105 --> 40:22.338
I will.

40:23.871 --> 40:25.805
Please, Bobby.

40:25.838 --> 40:27.438
Please.

40:27.471 --> 40:28.505
Please.

40:32.971 --> 40:35.138
I will.

40:35.171 --> 40:36.271
I will.

40:37.971 --> 40:39.338
I love you.

40:39.371 --> 40:40.171
I love you, too.

40:41.705 --> 40:42.638
Okay, buddy.

40:42.671 --> 40:45.605
(music playing)

41:23.478 --> 41:25.678
GAMBLE: It's a circumstantial
case, no doubt,

41:25.711 --> 41:29.245
but we have the eyewitness
from 16 years ago

41:29.278 --> 41:31.678
whose description matched
Bernice White.

41:31.711 --> 41:34.911
We know the kidnapper hired
Mr. Berluti.

41:34.945 --> 41:37.645
We know Ms. White has gone
into Mr. Berluti's office

41:37.678 --> 41:40.211
twice in the last two days.

41:40.245 --> 41:43.011
Proving her guilty
isn't my concern.

41:43.045 --> 41:44.545
Locating the girl,
that may prove

41:44.578 --> 41:46.511
to be more difficult.

41:46.545 --> 41:50.345
A mother has been missing
her child for 16 years.

41:50.378 --> 41:52.178
If Ms. White has any sense

41:52.211 --> 41:54.545
of decency or humanity,

41:55.278 --> 41:57.445
she'll help us here.

41:57.478 --> 41:59.918
If she's got a conscience,

41:59.951 --> 42:01.151
we feel we have a real chance.

42:01.185 --> 42:04.118
(music playing)

42:15.518 --> 42:16.585
YOUNG: Next on "The Practice".

42:16.618 --> 42:18.885
A witness saw you
leave with the baby.

42:18.918 --> 42:21.251
And now with the police
aren't telling you,

42:21.285 --> 42:22.985
they've now located
the woman

42:23.018 --> 42:24.485
you gave the baby to.

42:25.585 --> 42:27.151
BERLUTI:
Bernice White confessed.

42:27.185 --> 42:28.685
For a crime she didn't commit?

42:28.718 --> 42:30.851
I'd like to represent
Bernice.

42:30.885 --> 42:32.885
You lied to her.
I'm allowed to do that.

42:32.918 --> 42:34.685
I'm going
right into court.

42:35.218 --> 42:37.851
And what was your proposal
on lethal force?

42:37.885 --> 42:41.118
Referring the court
to page--

42:41.151 --> 42:42.251
You have to have it ready.

42:42.285 --> 42:43.451
Okay.

42:43.485 --> 42:44.851
DOLE: Is Rebecca
really the one to argue?

42:44.885 --> 42:47.051
She's never even appeared
before the appeals court.

42:47.085 --> 42:48.418
This is the SJC.

42:48.451 --> 42:49.618
She's ready.

42:51.885 --> 42:54.818
(music playing)

43:17.725 --> 43:19.258
WOMAN: You stinker!

43:19.525 --> 43:22.325
(music playing)
