WEBVTT

02:11.548 --> 02:13.800
Well, you're not
just some bumpkin.

02:13.884 --> 02:15.344
Some son of a country boar.

02:15.427 --> 02:16.678
You're a gentleman.

02:16.762 --> 02:18.680
Remember that
when you get to Paris.

02:18.764 --> 02:20.223
A D'Artagnan from Gascony

02:20.307 --> 02:22.309
is as much a gentleman
as anybody else.

02:22.392 --> 02:23.977
- Maybe more so.
- Yes, father.

02:24.061 --> 02:25.663
Now I give you this letter
for monsieur De Treville,

02:25.687 --> 02:27.189
he is a Gascon.

02:27.272 --> 02:29.733
He's captain
of the King's musketeers.

02:29.816 --> 02:31.234
I can't give you anything else.

02:31.318 --> 02:34.571
A little advice.
A few crowns.

02:34.655 --> 02:36.907
- A horse.
- A horse?

02:36.990 --> 02:38.241
A great black horse?

02:38.325 --> 02:40.202
A horse, yes.

02:47.417 --> 02:49.169
It's not horses.
It's not the money.

02:49.252 --> 02:51.004
It's that letter
to <i>Monsieur</i> De Treville.

02:51.088 --> 02:53.423
And, remember above all
that you are a D'Artagnan.

02:53.507 --> 02:55.133
Your honor is your treasure.

02:55.217 --> 02:56.677
And you are nothing
from any man.

02:56.760 --> 02:59.012
I've taught you
the sword, alright.

02:59.096 --> 03:02.808
The slightest insult.
The smallest smirk.

03:08.689 --> 03:10.107
My son.

03:12.901 --> 03:14.194
Father.

03:35.882 --> 03:39.094
I shall endure nothing, sir,
from any man!

03:39.177 --> 03:41.513
Bye...

03:41.596 --> 03:43.056
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

03:57.279 --> 03:58.488
Boy!

03:59.531 --> 04:00.949
My horse.

04:11.209 --> 04:12.544
Boy!

04:12.627 --> 04:13.795
My horse.

04:16.798 --> 04:18.508
You find me amusing?

04:18.592 --> 04:21.887
Perhaps you'll find three feet
of steel even more amusing.

04:21.970 --> 04:23.810
If you are trying to be
as funny as your horse,

04:23.889 --> 04:25.140
you haven't a chance.

04:25.223 --> 04:27.684
I endure no such remarks
from any man.

04:27.768 --> 04:29.227
What in thunder.

04:29.311 --> 04:30.353
<i>Monsieur?</i>

04:32.314 --> 04:34.167
Forgive me, My Lady,
there'll be a moment's delay,

04:34.191 --> 04:36.359
while I dispose of
this local fire pot.

04:36.443 --> 04:37.944
Which is more important?

04:38.028 --> 04:40.238
Richelieu's mission
or your passing quarrels?

04:40.322 --> 04:42.365
How do you know
he's one of the King's spies?

04:42.449 --> 04:43.909
But, My Lady, I...

04:46.745 --> 04:48.789
Sir, I await your pleasure.

04:52.626 --> 04:54.294
Must I arrange everything?

04:54.377 --> 04:56.755
Search him. If he has
any papers, destroy them.

04:56.838 --> 04:58.131
Yes, My Lady.

05:32.666 --> 05:34.251
Where do I find
<i>Monsieur</i> De Treville,

05:34.334 --> 05:35.836
captain of
the King's musketeers?

05:35.919 --> 05:37.337
Inside, up the stairs.

05:56.231 --> 05:58.525
What am I going to do with you?

05:58.608 --> 06:02.112
As a King's musketeer Aramis,
you'd make a fine priest.

06:02.195 --> 06:03.613
And, you Porthas,

06:03.697 --> 06:05.949
a fine structure
to hang pretty clothes on.

06:06.032 --> 06:07.576
- Where's Athos?
- III captain.

06:07.659 --> 06:10.745
- Very ill. Mortally ill.
- Then recapture me.

06:10.829 --> 06:12.747
- What do you want?
- A <i>monsieur</i> D'Artagnan.

06:12.831 --> 06:14.600
- He has no letter.
- Then why are you bothering me?

06:14.624 --> 06:16.626
- He's a Gascon, sir.
- Show him in.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.545
The three of you
brawling.

06:18.628 --> 06:22.173
Getting yourself arrested.
By three of Richelieu's guards.

06:22.257 --> 06:24.050
When you weren't even
outnumbered.

06:24.134 --> 06:25.719
The King is humiliated.

06:25.802 --> 06:27.721
Forgive me, captain, I'm late.

06:31.141 --> 06:32.934
- Hmm.
- You're wounded.

06:33.018 --> 06:35.437
Who told the King we weren't
outnumbered? He was lying.

06:35.520 --> 06:37.397
Tell me who said it, captain,
I'll cut him--

06:37.480 --> 06:40.233
It was Richelieu who
reported the affair to the King.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.737
My apologies, gentlemen.

06:43.820 --> 06:45.155
Dismissed.

06:51.077 --> 06:54.289
<i>Monsieur</i> De Treville.
I ask one favor, my captain.

06:54.372 --> 06:56.833
Let mine be the hand that
avenges these men.

06:58.710 --> 07:00.462
I have a bad cough.

07:00.545 --> 07:04.007
These gentlemen happen to be the
three best swordsman in Paris.

07:04.090 --> 07:07.010
I think, Gascon, they can take
care of themselves.

07:07.093 --> 07:08.553
What is it you
want?

07:09.638 --> 07:11.097
To be a musketeer.

07:11.181 --> 07:12.825
I admire your spirit,
but you have come to me

07:12.849 --> 07:14.142
without even a letter.

07:14.225 --> 07:16.311
I had a letter.
It was stolen.

07:16.394 --> 07:19.272
- Oh, that swine, if I get my--
- Quietly, quietly.

07:19.356 --> 07:20.482
What happened?

07:20.565 --> 07:22.525
Well, sir, it was at Desacres.

07:22.609 --> 07:24.277
A great tall,
ugly man with a scar.

07:24.361 --> 07:25.904
Was he alone?

07:25.987 --> 07:28.490
There was a lady in a carriage.
A very beautiful lady.

07:28.573 --> 07:30.116
Did he speak her name?

07:30.200 --> 07:32.327
No, sir, he called her
My Lady, but...

07:32.410 --> 07:34.621
- Do you know them, sir?
- She's back.

07:34.704 --> 07:37.248
- I beg you. Tell me their name.
- I'm going to the King.

07:37.332 --> 07:41.044
D'Artagnan, a man is sometimes
known by the enemies he makes.

07:41.127 --> 07:43.380
You'll receive an appointment
to the cadets.

07:43.463 --> 07:46.633
In due time you may perhaps
be admitted to the musketeers.

07:46.716 --> 07:48.176
<i>Monsieur!</i>

07:48.969 --> 07:50.095
Oh.

07:51.554 --> 07:53.807
Captain, my gratitude. I...

08:07.696 --> 08:10.115
Clumsy, big-footed idiot!

08:10.198 --> 08:12.617
You are addressing
a future musketeer.

08:14.035 --> 08:16.371
A future musketeer?

08:16.454 --> 08:18.665
If you get the cackle birds
out of your hair perhaps.

08:18.748 --> 08:20.750
And the barn yard
out of your manners.

08:20.834 --> 08:22.460
I resent that.

08:22.544 --> 08:24.421
Well, I shall give you
every opportunity

08:24.504 --> 08:27.674
to acquit your resentment
behind the Luxembourg at noon.

08:27.757 --> 08:29.384
Willingly, sir.

08:29.467 --> 08:30.677
Hmm...

08:37.267 --> 08:40.437
Fair point, gentlemen.
The duchess is swooned by feet.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.814
I'll rapture my cape and...

08:43.773 --> 08:45.233
My cape!

08:45.316 --> 08:47.861
A thousand pardons!
How do I get out of here?

08:47.944 --> 08:49.362
On the end of my foot.

08:53.742 --> 08:56.327
I endure no such insult
from any man.

08:56.411 --> 08:58.580
Perhaps you'll endure my sword
in your belly at...

08:58.663 --> 09:00.540
- Name the hour. One.
- One.

09:09.215 --> 09:10.508
Twelve...

09:11.176 --> 09:12.427
One.

09:15.221 --> 09:17.724
Oh!

09:23.313 --> 09:25.565
You embarrass me.

09:25.648 --> 09:28.002
Oh, now, Aramis, don't tell me
there is no lady in your life?

09:28.026 --> 09:30.779
My life is dedicated to things
of the spirit, not of the flesh.

09:30.862 --> 09:33.364
My habit may be that of a
musketeer, my habits are not.

09:33.448 --> 09:34.699
You sir!

09:34.783 --> 09:36.743
- Who, me?
- Yes, you!

09:37.660 --> 09:38.828
Wait!

09:40.038 --> 09:41.498
I was addressing you, sir.

09:44.626 --> 09:46.127
What is your hurry?

09:46.211 --> 09:48.755
- Oh, no, hurry at all, sir.
- Oh, that's better.

09:48.838 --> 09:50.340
Now, tell me.

09:50.423 --> 09:53.468
Do I look like a man who
spends his time with the ladies?

09:55.220 --> 09:56.596
Well, if you don't, sir,

09:56.679 --> 09:59.641
then Paris must echo
with the ladies sighs.

09:59.724 --> 10:01.518
That's not what I asked
you.

10:01.601 --> 10:04.521
These gentlemen insist that
I waste my time with the ladies.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.648
I cannot conceive, sir.

10:06.731 --> 10:09.234
That in the company of a lady,
you'd waste a single moment.

10:09.317 --> 10:10.693
Nave...

10:10.777 --> 10:12.654
Take your heel
before I take your throat.

10:12.737 --> 10:14.531
<i>Monsieur</i> Aramis, your language.

10:14.614 --> 10:16.574
Would you care to
object to my language

10:16.658 --> 10:19.285
behind the Louvre at 1 o'clock?

10:24.415 --> 10:26.835
Yes, sir.

10:26.918 --> 10:29.587
Uh... couldn't we make it
at 2:00?

10:51.901 --> 10:54.028
Well, you're in good time.

10:54.112 --> 10:56.197
Where are your seconds?

10:56.281 --> 10:57.991
Well, I have no seconds,
<i>Monsieur</i> Athos.

10:58.074 --> 11:00.410
I-- I only arrived
in Paris last night.

11:00.493 --> 11:02.287
What a pity.

11:02.370 --> 11:05.957
To arrive in Paris on one day
and to be killed on the next.

11:06.040 --> 11:08.459
Oh, there is no hurry,
my seconds haven't arrived yet.

11:08.543 --> 11:09.794
Uh, with all respect, sir,

11:09.878 --> 11:11.462
would it be proper
if we didn't wait?

11:11.546 --> 11:14.841
You see, I have a similar
appointment in an hour.

11:14.924 --> 11:17.343
That is, if I survive this one.

11:18.261 --> 11:21.097
No, just as you say.

11:21.181 --> 11:23.850
But don't worry about it,
you won't survive.

11:23.933 --> 11:25.226
You know, you're quite a fellow.

11:25.310 --> 11:27.520
Your first day in Paris
and two duels.

11:27.604 --> 11:28.771
Three.

11:28.855 --> 11:30.732
I have another one
an hour later.

11:30.815 --> 11:33.276
- Oh, no.
- Are these your seconds?

11:33.359 --> 11:34.986
Athos,
this isn't the man you fight?

11:35.069 --> 11:36.255
- Why not?
- But I fight him in an hour.

11:36.279 --> 11:37.739
- And I at 2:00.
- You at 2:00?

11:37.822 --> 11:39.782
What a complete madman!

11:39.866 --> 11:41.802
You know I'm affording
a positive affection for you.

11:41.826 --> 11:43.286
You can afford an affection.

11:43.369 --> 11:44.763
You'll get him before
he's a corpse.

11:44.787 --> 11:46.265
- Who are you to complain?
- Complain?

11:46.289 --> 11:48.374
- Now, just a minute!
- Who found him first?

11:48.458 --> 11:50.293
Gentlemen!

11:50.376 --> 11:52.378
Gentlemen,
your quarrels are with me,

11:52.462 --> 11:53.755
not with each other.

11:58.468 --> 12:01.262
To talk so well
and to die so young.

12:01.346 --> 12:03.306
I really do regret this.

12:07.227 --> 12:09.229
Sir, your wound, I...

12:09.312 --> 12:11.689
You'll find the left hand
most confusing.

12:11.773 --> 12:13.024
Come on.

12:32.126 --> 12:33.628
Ready?

12:59.320 --> 13:01.322
- Athos!
- Jussacs.

13:01.406 --> 13:03.741
Richelieu's guards.

13:03.825 --> 13:05.618
- Five of them.
- Shield your swords.

13:05.702 --> 13:08.454
- You're under arrest.
- Three against five, eh?

13:08.538 --> 13:11.374
Four against five.

13:11.457 --> 13:13.710
This gives me great pleasure,
gentlemen.

13:13.793 --> 13:15.295
Duels are forbidden.

13:15.378 --> 13:16.938
In the name of
Prime Minister Richelieu,

13:16.963 --> 13:19.257
I arrest you.

13:19.340 --> 13:21.342
Do your best in the King's name.

13:47.285 --> 13:49.329
Why don't you use
your right hand, Athos?

13:49.412 --> 13:51.414
I save my right hand
for my drinking.

14:02.091 --> 14:03.259
Eh!

14:14.437 --> 14:16.105
- Hey!
- Whoo!

14:24.989 --> 14:26.449
Aaah!

14:31.704 --> 14:33.706
Be careful, huh, that's Jussuac.

14:47.220 --> 14:48.262
Ah!

15:00.108 --> 15:01.234
Porthos!

15:07.490 --> 15:08.950
Ah-ah-ha.

15:09.033 --> 15:10.201
Let him go.

15:22.880 --> 15:24.132
Gentlemen!

15:24.215 --> 15:25.967
No, come watch.

15:41.858 --> 15:43.818
Is, uh, this the peasant
you were going to fight

15:43.901 --> 15:45.278
with your left hand?

15:58.040 --> 15:59.250
Ha-ha!

16:00.251 --> 16:01.461
Hey!

16:16.309 --> 16:17.435
Oh-hmm...

16:29.697 --> 16:31.824
Uh! Wo-ah!

16:31.908 --> 16:33.993
Whoa! Ah-ha.

16:43.920 --> 16:45.129
Hey!

17:00.144 --> 17:01.854
- Uh!
- Ha-ha-ha-ha.

17:01.938 --> 17:03.356
Ha-ha-ha. Oh-ho-ho.

17:14.951 --> 17:15.993
Heh!

17:26.587 --> 17:27.797
Who-ohho!

17:27.880 --> 17:29.382
Ha-ha!

17:38.140 --> 17:39.267
Hey!

17:45.898 --> 17:47.817
Bravo! Bravo!

18:05.459 --> 18:06.961
Who are you?

18:09.797 --> 18:13.009
Tell Richelieu,
the name is D'Artagnan.

18:49.003 --> 18:50.755
You immoderate men.

18:50.838 --> 18:52.256
Which one of you was so vulgar

18:52.340 --> 18:54.634
as to use Jussac's trousers
as a target?

18:54.717 --> 18:55.968
I did, sir.

18:56.052 --> 18:58.095
You did, D'Artagnan?

18:58.179 --> 19:00.556
By tomorrow
you'll be the talk of Paris.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.099
But you have
a great deal to learn.

19:02.183 --> 19:04.185
Richelieu is
the King's first minister.

19:04.268 --> 19:07.271
He's an unpopular,
but extremely powerful man.

19:07.355 --> 19:11.025
Richelieu has many ambitions.
Such as war against England.

19:11.108 --> 19:13.194
And, most important,
the complete destruction

19:13.277 --> 19:16.197
of the King's powers.
The King's position is delicate.

19:16.280 --> 19:18.532
We don't want
to make it impossible.

19:18.616 --> 19:20.201
Send him back a corpse, alright.

19:20.284 --> 19:22.953
But don't send him back
with his trousers dripping.

19:23.037 --> 19:25.206
Now, do you understand?

19:25.289 --> 19:26.957
- No, sir.
- Captain De Treville.

19:27.041 --> 19:29.168
His majesty the King orders
the immediate presence of

19:29.251 --> 19:32.630
Captain De Treville, musketeers
Athos, Aramis and Porthas.

19:32.713 --> 19:34.715
And somebody called D'Artagnan.

20:02.118 --> 20:04.245
Fine lot of brainless
cut throats.

20:04.328 --> 20:07.289
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Obvious imbeciles!

20:07.373 --> 20:10.167
- Which is this one?
- D'Artagnan, Your Majesty.

20:10.251 --> 20:12.336
Well, why doesn't he have
some decent clothes?

20:12.420 --> 20:13.879
How can I face Richelieu

20:13.963 --> 20:16.924
when my men don't wear
decent clothes?

20:17.007 --> 20:18.888
Which of these is the one
who so embarrassed me?

20:18.968 --> 20:21.887
- D'Artagnan, Your Majesty.
- Imbecile!

20:21.971 --> 20:24.640
Don't they realize that
Richelieu is my dearest friend

20:24.724 --> 20:25.808
and stance defender?

20:25.891 --> 20:27.143
They do, Your Majesty.

20:27.226 --> 20:29.103
Don't they realize
that the dignity

20:29.186 --> 20:31.063
of my first minister
is the dignity of--

20:31.147 --> 20:33.023
They're impetuous men,
Your Majesty--

20:33.107 --> 20:35.818
Don't interrupt me
when I am talking well.

20:37.069 --> 20:38.320
What did you say?

20:38.404 --> 20:40.448
They're impetuous men,
Your Majesty.

20:40.531 --> 20:42.241
Impetuous imbeciles!

20:44.744 --> 20:46.162
Five hundred francs.

20:47.246 --> 20:48.372
Hmm!

20:48.456 --> 20:49.457
There.

20:50.458 --> 20:53.169
There. There.

20:53.252 --> 20:55.379
Go on. Go on! Go on away.

20:55.463 --> 20:57.715
And get this fella
some decent clothes.

21:18.611 --> 21:20.821
Wardrobe, a valet, a horse.

21:20.905 --> 21:22.531
All he needs now
is a rich widow.

21:29.246 --> 21:31.373
Planchet, my horse.

21:31.457 --> 21:34.126
Gentlemen, my quarters.

21:42.802 --> 21:46.347
Welcome to your quarters,
D'Artagnan.

21:46.430 --> 21:49.433
Get that man out of here!
He claims to be your landlord.

21:49.517 --> 21:51.519
He is, <i>Monsieur</i> Bonacieux.

21:51.602 --> 21:53.354
Ah, just as I suspected.

21:53.437 --> 21:55.648
He was telling the truth.
Well, get him out of here.

21:55.731 --> 21:57.733
- I can not abide landlords.
- Ha-ha.

21:57.817 --> 22:00.986
Please, just a moment of your
time. I need you, sir.

22:01.070 --> 22:02.696
- Ah?
- I live below you.

22:02.780 --> 22:04.365
I am going away
on a long journey

22:04.448 --> 22:06.116
and won't be back for weeks.

22:06.200 --> 22:09.078
I have a goddaughter
named Constance.

22:09.161 --> 22:12.540
- She is in danger, sir.
- In danger of what?

22:12.623 --> 22:14.625
Well, she's one of
the queen's maids.

22:14.708 --> 22:17.753
I suspect she's being followed
by Richelieu's men.

22:17.837 --> 22:19.547
Richelieu's men are notorious

22:19.630 --> 22:21.340
for their complete
lack of taste.

22:21.423 --> 22:23.133
- I believe that.
- Ha-ha.

22:23.217 --> 22:25.018
I beg your pardon, sir,
but, the purposes are,

22:25.052 --> 22:27.012
as I suspect, political.

22:27.096 --> 22:29.765
But, she is trusted,
by the queen.

22:29.849 --> 22:31.350
Well, I beg of you, sir.

22:31.433 --> 22:34.061
It won't be a matter
of any great inconvenience.

22:34.144 --> 22:37.231
She comes home from the palace
only once or twice a week.

22:37.314 --> 22:40.568
You can keep an eye on the
street from your windows.

22:40.651 --> 22:42.194
And here.

22:47.116 --> 22:49.159
You can keep an eye on our
rooms.

22:49.243 --> 22:51.370
Athos.

22:51.453 --> 22:53.747
This all sounds
a little too convenient.

22:53.831 --> 22:57.209
The floorboards,
the goddaughter, the danger.

22:57.293 --> 23:00.379
And, my young friend has
recently distinguished himself

23:00.462 --> 23:03.382
as an outstanding defender
of the throne.

23:03.465 --> 23:05.926
It smells my dear landlord,
of Richelieu.

23:06.010 --> 23:07.386
- Now, get out!
- I swear...

23:07.469 --> 23:09.763
- Oh, gentlemen.
- Planchet!

23:09.847 --> 23:12.182
- Remove this man.
- Oh, I swear to you.

23:12.266 --> 23:14.268
No, <i>Monsieur</i> D'Artagnan.

23:19.982 --> 23:21.775
- He rolls well.
- Ha-ha.

23:21.859 --> 23:25.112
Planchet!
Get me some nails and a hammer.

23:25.195 --> 23:27.281
Maybe I can borrow some
from the landlord.

24:31.720 --> 24:33.263
Wua-ah...

25:32.281 --> 25:34.283
Ah!

25:50.257 --> 25:51.508
Hey!

25:56.513 --> 25:57.514
Ah!

26:29.296 --> 26:30.589
Get out!

26:52.569 --> 26:55.405
<i>Oh, monsieur, monsieur.
You</i> come from heaven.

26:55.489 --> 26:58.867
<i>No, mademoiselle.</i>
Just from upstairs.

26:58.951 --> 27:02.287
Whoever you are,
in the queen's name I thank you.

27:02.371 --> 27:05.124
And, now please, please,
just for an instant.

27:05.207 --> 27:08.293
- Eh? Oh.
- Alright? Please.

27:08.377 --> 27:09.461
Oh.

27:14.883 --> 27:16.802
Master, you're wounded.

27:16.885 --> 27:20.389
Mortally, fatally, in the heart.

27:20.472 --> 27:21.807
Oh, I'll-- I'll get a physician.

27:21.890 --> 27:23.767
I shall never recover.

27:25.519 --> 27:27.729
Keep watch, man!
I am on the queen's business.

27:31.525 --> 27:33.235
Sorry, monsieur,
to be in such a hurry.

27:33.318 --> 27:34.820
No greater hurry than I.

27:34.903 --> 27:36.780
- I love you.
- What?

27:36.864 --> 27:38.490
I love you. I love you.

27:38.574 --> 27:41.743
Oh, mademoiselle,
inside me is a raging storm.

27:41.827 --> 27:43.871
From the first
instant I beheld you.

27:43.954 --> 27:45.581
By the way, what's your name?

27:45.664 --> 27:48.083
- Constance.
- Constance.

27:48.167 --> 27:50.169
Oh, Constance.

27:50.252 --> 27:51.545
My own.

27:51.628 --> 27:52.671
My all.

27:52.754 --> 27:54.715
My blood rages like a torrent.

27:54.798 --> 27:56.341
My heart beats like a drum.

27:56.425 --> 27:58.927
I come from the end of the earth
to implore you.

27:59.011 --> 28:01.889
I thought you said
you came from upstairs.

28:01.972 --> 28:04.016
To be as far from you
as that is what it takes

28:04.099 --> 28:05.559
to be at the end of the earth.

28:05.642 --> 28:07.311
You're mad.

28:07.394 --> 28:10.647
No, don't stop. Lace me off the
back while you're talking.

28:10.731 --> 28:12.065
Oh...

28:14.651 --> 28:17.613
I'm your servant,
your subject, your slave.

28:17.696 --> 28:19.406
Your pleasure is my life.

28:19.489 --> 28:20.991
Your will, my law.

28:21.074 --> 28:25.287
My life is yours.
My heart, my sword.

28:25.370 --> 28:27.456
Anything you demand.

28:27.539 --> 28:30.375
My last drop of blood.

28:33.003 --> 28:35.631
Why do I have to
start out on the laces?

28:42.095 --> 28:43.972
I didn't do very well, did I?

28:45.390 --> 28:48.602
I was only trying to say
I love you.

28:48.685 --> 28:51.146
Maybe you should've
told me your name first.

28:52.314 --> 28:53.690
D'Artagnan.

28:54.608 --> 28:56.109
D'Artagnan?

28:57.444 --> 28:58.904
The famous swordsman.

29:00.197 --> 29:01.865
The famous booby.

29:01.949 --> 29:03.242
Oh, no.

29:08.830 --> 29:11.917
I only came from the country
a few days ago, I...

29:12.000 --> 29:14.544
I just got these clothes today.

29:14.628 --> 29:17.130
The famous D'Artagnan.

29:17.214 --> 29:18.924
Oh, I'm sorry. I'll go.

29:19.007 --> 29:20.425
No.

29:29.851 --> 29:34.815
Oh, D'Artagnan.
I am as simple as you are.

29:34.898 --> 29:37.734
I'm just a girl
who works at the palace and...

29:37.818 --> 29:39.695
I am not used to being in love.

29:47.661 --> 29:48.870
Oh, heavens.

29:50.831 --> 29:52.207
I'm late.

29:53.417 --> 29:54.793
Oh, I'm late.

29:56.586 --> 29:58.422
Swear on your honor
you won't follow me.

29:58.505 --> 30:00.257
But you're not going out of here
alone.

30:00.340 --> 30:03.760
Oh, trust me.
I beg of you, trust me.

30:04.845 --> 30:07.472
Where are you going?

30:07.556 --> 30:10.976
If you love me, please,
please don't follow me.

30:14.104 --> 30:15.355
But, I...

31:19.252 --> 31:21.630
- You asked me to trust you.
- D'Artagnan!

31:21.713 --> 31:22.964
And you leave me to keep some

31:23.048 --> 31:25.717
cheap rendezvous
on a street corner.

31:33.266 --> 31:34.726
Oh, stop it. Stop.

31:34.810 --> 31:36.411
It's George Villiers,
Duke of Buckingham.

31:36.478 --> 31:39.022
- Prime Minister of England.
- Buckingham?

31:39.106 --> 31:40.875
I'm sorry, my dear, but
the gentleman cannot be left

31:40.899 --> 31:42.168
in the possession
of such knowledge.

31:42.192 --> 31:43.461
It becomes my necessity
to kill him.

31:43.485 --> 31:44.653
Oh, Your Grace.

31:44.736 --> 31:47.406
He is loyal to the queen
and besides I...

31:47.489 --> 31:48.865
I love him.

31:48.949 --> 31:50.784
Forbade Richelieu
and all his spies

31:50.867 --> 31:53.370
and then risk being impaled upon
a lover's sword?

31:53.453 --> 31:55.872
Ha.
What a fate for England.

31:55.956 --> 31:57.249
Come.

32:08.427 --> 32:09.970
Be here a moment, please.

32:16.226 --> 32:18.145
Your Majesty,
a messenger from Spain

32:18.228 --> 32:20.147
has come with intelligence
of your presence.

32:33.577 --> 32:35.078
Her Majesty, the queen.

32:42.043 --> 32:44.713
Anne, my little Anne.

32:44.796 --> 32:47.132
George, A thousand times
you mustn't come.

32:47.215 --> 32:49.009
A thousand times I shall come.

32:50.010 --> 32:51.511
Oh, heaven, help me.

32:51.595 --> 32:53.513
Why can't you understand?

32:53.597 --> 32:56.057
I understand nothing
except that I love you.

32:56.141 --> 32:57.642
But the earth is small

32:57.726 --> 32:59.936
and there's no room on it
for you and me apart.

33:00.020 --> 33:02.439
Oh, my darling.

33:02.522 --> 33:04.524
Confess to me
that you still love me.

33:06.693 --> 33:08.695
Bear your tears in my evidence.

33:11.615 --> 33:14.868
I weep for myself.
For my husband, for my country.

33:14.951 --> 33:16.536
Your country is wise.

33:16.620 --> 33:18.163
But your husband's an idiot.

33:18.246 --> 33:19.915
But Richelieu's spies
are everywhere.

33:19.998 --> 33:21.708
In my court, in my bedchamber.

33:21.791 --> 33:24.169
- I have no one to trust.
- You have me.

33:24.252 --> 33:25.795
I have?

33:25.879 --> 33:28.548
Richelieu's spies discovered you
were coming to France

33:28.632 --> 33:30.967
even before you left England.

33:31.051 --> 33:32.886
And Countess De Winter?

33:32.969 --> 33:34.930
Under what
intimate circumstances

33:35.013 --> 33:36.115
did she discover the secret?

33:36.139 --> 33:37.557
Anne!

33:37.641 --> 33:39.184
Can't I even trust you?

33:40.519 --> 33:41.937
And I love you.

33:42.020 --> 33:43.730
And I can't help myself.

33:43.813 --> 33:45.524
You accuse me of faithlessness?

33:45.607 --> 33:49.110
No.
I accept it.

33:49.194 --> 33:51.446
George, I love you.

33:51.530 --> 33:53.406
But you mustn't come here again.

33:53.490 --> 33:55.534
I forbid you
ever to come to Paris.

33:55.617 --> 33:58.453
Alone, in disguise, at the mercy
of Richelieu's villains.

33:58.537 --> 34:00.664
Richelieu forbids me
to come as ambassador.

34:00.747 --> 34:02.749
Then, I shall
never see you again.

34:02.832 --> 34:04.584
No, if I cannot
see you as beggar...

34:04.668 --> 34:06.294
If I can not see you
as ambassador,

34:06.378 --> 34:08.147
then I shall see you as
conqueror. Do you understand?

34:08.171 --> 34:09.673
- Buckingham.
- England is mine.

34:09.756 --> 34:12.008
France shall be mine
and you shall be mine, Anne.

34:14.052 --> 34:15.554
But you must go.

34:21.726 --> 34:25.647
Here.
I give this to you in parting.

34:25.730 --> 34:27.482
We must never meet again.

34:30.694 --> 34:32.779
I shall treasure these
like I treasure my dearest

34:32.862 --> 34:34.906
recollections of you, Anne.

34:34.990 --> 34:37.617
As I treasure the anticipation
of our next meeting.

34:57.012 --> 34:58.972
The countess De Winter.

35:01.808 --> 35:03.268
Your Excellency.

35:03.351 --> 35:05.312
Welcome, My Lady.

35:05.395 --> 35:07.814
And you were never so welcome
as at this moment.

35:07.897 --> 35:09.733
Nor so unwilling to come.

35:09.816 --> 35:12.485
You promised me a holiday.
I'm having my holiday.

35:13.862 --> 35:15.238
Oh?

35:15.322 --> 35:17.949
Oh, yes, then, what is the name
of your holiday?

35:18.950 --> 35:20.785
The count De Wardes?

35:22.495 --> 35:25.206
Do you know everything
that transpires in France?

35:25.290 --> 35:28.376
I only know that I am in
the midst of a great project.

35:28.460 --> 35:31.713
And, that you, My Lady,
are part of that great project.

35:31.796 --> 35:34.257
I need you, My Lady.

35:34.341 --> 35:37.260
Buckingham is in possession
of a set of diamond studs.

35:37.344 --> 35:38.970
Twelve studs.

35:39.054 --> 35:41.264
I would be grateful,
immensely grateful,

35:41.348 --> 35:44.309
if you were to go to England
and steal two of them.

35:44.392 --> 35:45.977
Steal two?

35:46.061 --> 35:48.313
What am I, a common thief?

35:50.815 --> 35:55.820
I could hardly trust a common
thief with such a mission.

35:55.904 --> 35:59.240
The jewels were presented
to Buckingham only last night.

35:59.324 --> 36:00.575
By the queen.

36:00.659 --> 36:03.244
Oh, so he reached the queen.

36:03.328 --> 36:07.540
How comical,
despite all your precaution.

36:07.624 --> 36:09.959
I leave the making
of excuses to Rochefort

36:10.043 --> 36:12.962
and his excuses
can be quite imaginative.

36:13.046 --> 36:16.216
It's his claim that some lone
monster named D'Artagnan

36:16.299 --> 36:17.967
annihilated all my men.

36:18.051 --> 36:20.845
Oh, no.
What a catastrophe!

36:20.929 --> 36:24.265
It takes a good man to prevent
a catastrophe, My Lady.

36:24.349 --> 36:27.394
And a great man
to make use of one.

36:27.477 --> 36:29.938
You and I, my dear,
are rare new creatures

36:30.021 --> 36:32.899
in this ancient world
of impulsive men.

36:32.982 --> 36:36.319
We have intellect.
We think.

36:36.403 --> 36:39.572
When we think our impulsive
enemies are helpless.

36:42.742 --> 36:46.204
The King opposes my plans
for war with England.

36:46.287 --> 36:48.873
It's my belief that
if Buckingham's relations

36:48.957 --> 36:50.625
with the queen
can be demonstrated,

36:50.709 --> 36:54.587
his Majesty's opposition
to my plans may be lessened.

36:54.671 --> 36:58.049
But, Your Grace, how can you
trust me with such a confidence?

36:58.133 --> 37:00.176
What if I refuse
to go to England?

37:00.260 --> 37:02.345
Can there be any one
be more trustworthy, My Lady,

37:02.429 --> 37:04.931
than an ambitious woman
of fashion...

37:05.014 --> 37:07.559
with a history?

37:07.642 --> 37:09.370
You said yourself, My Lady,
I know everything

37:09.394 --> 37:12.731
that transpires
or has transpired...

37:12.814 --> 37:14.190
in France.

37:41.009 --> 37:42.594
The spies. They're everywhere.

37:42.677 --> 37:44.721
- Can you go to England?
- To England?

37:44.804 --> 37:47.515
Nobody knows I've come to you.
Only the queen.

37:47.599 --> 37:50.685
- Oh, the poor queen.
- Oh, Constance.

37:50.769 --> 37:52.705
Richelieu arranged a banquet
for the first of the month

37:52.729 --> 37:54.039
for the express purpose
of displaying

37:54.063 --> 37:55.190
the queen's new jewels.

37:55.273 --> 37:56.691
It's a set
of twelve diamond studs

37:56.775 --> 37:57.835
and he gave them to her
for her birthday

37:57.859 --> 37:59.235
and she has to wear them.

37:59.319 --> 38:00.379
- But, I...
- But they're in England.

38:00.403 --> 38:02.155
She gave them to Buckingham.

38:02.238 --> 38:04.678
Richelieu has found out and now
he wants the King to find out.

38:04.741 --> 38:07.118
And she just has to wear them
at the banquet or...

38:07.202 --> 38:09.287
Well, it's only nine days
and I don't...

38:15.293 --> 38:16.753
I love you.

38:18.213 --> 38:19.464
Oh...

38:23.384 --> 38:25.595
Oh, you'll-- you'll need this
letter.

38:27.764 --> 38:29.891
You tell the queen I'll be back
with her jewels

38:29.974 --> 38:32.185
in nine days time.

38:32.268 --> 38:34.145
What would I do without you?

38:45.073 --> 38:47.992
When I come back...

38:48.076 --> 38:50.119
When you come back...

39:06.553 --> 39:08.346
So, this letter must be
delivered in England

39:08.429 --> 39:10.765
and the jewels returned to Paris
by the first of the month?

39:10.849 --> 39:13.142
We have just one advantage.

39:13.226 --> 39:14.894
Richelieu doesn't know
we're going.

39:14.978 --> 39:17.522
My friend, my friend.

39:17.605 --> 39:21.693
My young country friend.
When will you learn about Paris?

39:21.776 --> 39:24.195
By now, Richelieu,
without the slightest question,

39:24.279 --> 39:27.156
knows even the color
of your underpants.

39:28.700 --> 39:31.786
Well, it's my obligation,
not yours.

39:31.870 --> 39:33.430
If we all went,
there'd be a better chance

39:33.454 --> 39:36.291
that one of us would survive
to return to Paris.

39:36.374 --> 39:39.335
To die among friends.

39:39.419 --> 39:43.506
Can a man ask more?
Can a world offer less?

39:43.590 --> 39:47.385
Who wants to live
until the last bottle is empty?

39:47.468 --> 39:50.305
It's all for one, D'Artagnan.

39:50.388 --> 39:52.098
And one for all.

40:44.525 --> 40:45.846
- On your way.
- Four against one.

40:45.902 --> 40:47.862
In the queen's name,
on your way!

40:52.700 --> 40:54.494
Stay with your master, Grebo.

41:20.311 --> 41:22.355
The town of Creve Coeur
lies just beyond.

41:24.607 --> 41:26.401
I once knew a lady
who lived there.

41:30.196 --> 41:31.948
Some of my most
beautiful memories

41:32.031 --> 41:34.158
are associated with this road.

41:43.876 --> 41:47.130
Aramis, are you alright?
Aramis, are you alright?

41:47.213 --> 41:48.798
Head that way.
That way, D'Artagnan

41:48.881 --> 41:51.050
I hope your lady
still lives in the town.

41:51.134 --> 41:54.721
That was long ago, D'Artagnan!
Long ago!

42:42.226 --> 42:44.145
Separate, men.
We will cut them off.

43:47.333 --> 43:48.835
Ah!

44:11.440 --> 44:12.733
Here, master!

44:17.155 --> 44:18.489
Jussac.

44:18.573 --> 44:20.074
We meet again,
D'Artagnan.

44:51.272 --> 44:53.983
Hey.

46:11.686 --> 46:13.396
Ride, D'Artagnan, the queen.

46:17.817 --> 46:19.110
Planchet.

46:59.442 --> 47:00.735
A boat for England.

47:00.818 --> 47:03.070
The port was closed last night.

47:03.154 --> 47:05.698
- By whose orders?
- Richelieu's, <i>monsieur.</i>

47:05.781 --> 47:07.241
Our beloved Richelieu.

47:07.325 --> 47:08.951
A boat for England.

47:09.035 --> 47:10.828
No boats.
The port is closed.

47:10.911 --> 47:12.413
I am the Count De Wardes.

47:12.496 --> 47:14.999
I have special permission
from Richelieu.

47:15.082 --> 47:17.403
You will have to get it signed
by the governor of the port.

47:19.045 --> 47:22.089
Where could I find this
individual?

47:22.173 --> 47:23.507
The last house on the point.

47:48.657 --> 47:52.661
And such a handsome man he was.

47:52.745 --> 47:55.873
Don't talk like that.
He is not dead.

47:55.956 --> 48:00.044
Well, I'd rather be dead
than resemble a sieve.

48:00.127 --> 48:04.715
Or maybe I...
Maybe, I'd just rather be dead.

48:04.799 --> 48:06.300
- What a man.
- Hmm.

48:06.384 --> 48:08.302
I said what a man.

48:08.386 --> 48:11.097
Letters from the famous
Countess De Winter.

48:11.180 --> 48:12.932
By the way, Planchet,
don't forget.

48:13.015 --> 48:15.017
My name is...

48:15.101 --> 48:18.312
I am the Count De Wardes.

48:18.396 --> 48:20.981
The Count Du B...

48:30.908 --> 48:32.386
<i>Monsieur</i> D'Artagnan,
I can think of no one

48:32.410 --> 48:34.161
to whom I prefer
to entrust these.

48:34.245 --> 48:36.014
My only regret is that
you are not an Englishman.

48:36.038 --> 48:37.415
An Englishman, your grace

48:37.498 --> 48:39.583
would probably take this box
back to Paris

48:39.667 --> 48:41.377
without looking to see what is
inside it.

48:41.460 --> 48:43.671
With all respect, sir,
I am a Frenchman.

48:43.754 --> 48:45.506
You skeptic.

48:51.137 --> 48:53.806
Valet! Valet!

48:53.889 --> 48:55.224
You disgusting thieves.

48:55.307 --> 48:57.351
Which one of you
stole these jewels?

48:57.435 --> 48:59.812
I will have you hanged from
the highest bridge in London.

48:59.895 --> 49:01.480
- Oh, your--
- Don't lie to me!

49:01.564 --> 49:03.232
No one has been
in my room, except...

49:07.319 --> 49:10.364
Summon my jeweler.
This instant!

49:13.576 --> 49:14.845
How many days
do you have left? Five?

49:14.869 --> 49:16.662
Without
the other two studs, sir--

49:16.745 --> 49:18.765
Never mind about that, if your
feet had wings, monsieur,

49:18.789 --> 49:19.808
and you rode the wind,
how long would it take

49:19.832 --> 49:21.625
for you to get to Paris?

49:21.709 --> 49:23.627
- Three days.
- You are alone?

49:23.711 --> 49:25.421
I left Paris with friends, sir.

49:25.504 --> 49:27.465
I hope at least
one of them is alive

49:27.548 --> 49:29.175
and can help me get back.

49:37.933 --> 49:41.228
Rochefort, draw 100,000 Francs
for the Countess De Winter.

49:41.312 --> 49:42.872
- Yes, <i>monsieur.</i>
- Oh, and, Rochefort...

49:42.938 --> 49:45.232
what about that body
of young D'Artagnan?

49:45.316 --> 49:47.109
- He is dead.
- Excellent.

49:47.193 --> 49:49.320
Then why do you seem so unhappy?

49:49.403 --> 49:52.323
Well, five of my men have each
assured me he killed him.

49:52.406 --> 49:55.493
And each of them
in five different places.

49:55.576 --> 49:57.453
Place extra guards
on every road.

49:57.536 --> 50:00.372
Close the gates of Paris until
D'Artagnan's corpse

50:00.456 --> 50:02.041
is delivered to me here
in my palace.

50:02.124 --> 50:04.627
Or his person is lodged
in the Bastille.

50:04.710 --> 50:06.587
<i>Yes, monsieur.</i>

50:06.670 --> 50:08.422
Nobly said, <i>monsieur.</i>

50:08.506 --> 50:10.382
Oh, I have every confidence
that you,

50:10.466 --> 50:13.260
you who are the equal
of catastrophes in Kings,

50:13.344 --> 50:14.887
you will someday be equal
to this man

50:14.970 --> 50:18.098
who isn't yet a musketeer.

50:36.867 --> 50:40.371
- Hello, D'Artagnan.
- Porthos!

50:40.454 --> 50:42.039
They told you were wounded.

50:42.122 --> 50:44.583
I am, I am, but the jewels...

50:44.667 --> 50:46.043
Here, safe.

50:46.126 --> 50:49.088
Ah, that man, that Buckingham.

50:49.171 --> 50:52.132
Two had been stolen and he had
two new ones made in 48 hours.

50:52.216 --> 50:55.052
Well, come on, man.
Get your horse. I need you.

50:57.596 --> 51:00.307
Porthos, when did a wound ever
come between you and a fight?

51:00.391 --> 51:03.185
Well, unfortunately
the position of this wound

51:03.269 --> 51:04.937
comes between me and my horse.

51:09.567 --> 51:11.253
I give you my word
I was not running away.

51:11.277 --> 51:12.820
I was fighting magnificently
when...

51:12.903 --> 51:15.739
Who should appear?
But no, what a beautiful woman.

51:15.823 --> 51:19.743
I let my eyes stray for
just a moment when... zing...

51:19.827 --> 51:20.995
I am disgraced.

51:22.705 --> 51:24.790
When was I ever wounded
in a locality

51:24.873 --> 51:26.333
so impossible to explain?

51:26.417 --> 51:30.087
- Well...
- I can see you're in doubt.

51:30.170 --> 51:32.172
No, my dear friend,
merely in a hurry.

51:32.256 --> 51:34.341
- Where can I find Aramis?
- In a monastery.

51:34.425 --> 51:35.425
Where?

51:35.467 --> 51:36.885
Our friend Aramis has renounced

51:36.969 --> 51:38.137
the world of the flesh.

51:38.220 --> 51:39.763
But it has only been a few days.

51:39.847 --> 51:42.141
Hm, yes, he says a great deal
can happen

51:42.224 --> 51:45.603
in just few days to change
a man's life. I suspect--

51:45.686 --> 51:48.314
His Lady in Creve Coeur
didn't remember him.

51:48.397 --> 51:51.400
Oh, heaven, heaven.
Let Athos still be alive.

52:03.120 --> 52:05.080
- I said wine!
- I have none.

52:05.164 --> 52:07.041
- What kind of--
- Go down in your cellar?

52:07.124 --> 52:08.500
I can't go down in my cellar.

52:08.584 --> 52:10.628
- Why not?
- <i>Merci,</i> gentlemen.

52:10.711 --> 52:14.465
Believe me, there is
a madman in my cellar.

52:14.548 --> 52:15.883
A madman.

52:15.966 --> 52:18.218
He took refuge in my cellar
a week ago.

52:18.302 --> 52:22.681
He's been down there for a week.
All my food. All my wine.

52:22.765 --> 52:25.184
Three more days like this
and I am ruined.

52:25.267 --> 52:29.146
Athos, Athos! Open up,
it's D'Artagnan.

52:29.229 --> 52:30.814
Athos, it's D'Artagnan!

52:30.898 --> 52:34.318
The flowing bowl,
the flowing bowl.

52:34.401 --> 52:39.073
Fill up the flagons with wine...

52:39.156 --> 52:42.326
D'Artagnan. My friend, welcome!

52:45.579 --> 52:46.789
Welcome.

52:48.999 --> 52:51.418
My beautiful magnificent friend.

52:53.921 --> 52:57.216
Hinault,
wine for <i>Monsieur</i> D'Artagnan.

53:01.929 --> 53:04.723
The best in the house
for my dearest...

53:04.807 --> 53:06.642
for <i>Monsieur</i> D'Artagnan.

53:09.269 --> 53:12.022
I thought we had to be
in Paris tonight.

53:12.106 --> 53:15.818
Here, man, you're-- you're not
drinking.

53:15.901 --> 53:17.653
Please sober up,
for heaven's sake.

53:17.736 --> 53:19.071
Ah, Puritan...

53:19.154 --> 53:22.783
His Lady doesn't
approve of drinking.

53:22.866 --> 53:25.119
Let me tell you about women.

53:25.202 --> 53:27.162
- Athos.
- I knew a woman once--

53:27.246 --> 53:28.539
Athos!

53:28.622 --> 53:31.125
No. Let's say that
I had a friend.

53:31.208 --> 53:35.087
An aristocratic young friend.
He knew a woman.

53:35.170 --> 53:36.672
Athos, for heaven's sake.

53:36.755 --> 53:38.525
Have you forgotten
we are riding to the queen?

53:38.549 --> 53:40.676
I was telling you about women.

53:40.759 --> 53:43.011
Well, then tell it to the wind
of your own making!

53:43.095 --> 53:46.473
Have you forgotten our pledge?
All for one and one for all?

53:46.557 --> 53:51.145
You pompous,
village bore.

53:51.228 --> 53:53.731
You hero.

53:53.814 --> 53:58.026
What do you know of
anything besides swordplay?

53:58.110 --> 54:01.280
I was speaking of women.

54:03.240 --> 54:05.617
This friend...

54:05.701 --> 54:09.830
This aristocratic friend.

54:09.913 --> 54:13.667
Fell in love
with a country wench.

54:13.751 --> 54:16.628
He married her and took her
to his ancestral bed.

54:18.964 --> 54:21.884
She was beautiful.
He worshipped her.

54:21.967 --> 54:24.344
As in an ancient aura.

54:24.428 --> 54:26.013
The pure, the good.

54:28.724 --> 54:31.143
His angel of light.

54:36.148 --> 54:40.569
But within a week's time his
angel of light had led

54:40.652 --> 54:44.281
a neighbor, a young and truthful
life of chastity

54:44.364 --> 54:47.242
and together they eluded
the local church.

54:49.036 --> 54:51.580
My friend run the confession
from the woman

54:51.663 --> 54:53.582
and turned her over
to the executioner

54:53.665 --> 54:58.253
who branded her shoulder
with a <i>fleur-de-lis.</i>

55:00.964 --> 55:03.217
Then he cast her
out of his house

55:03.300 --> 55:07.679
renounced his ancestral claims
and fled.

55:10.098 --> 55:14.978
He changed his name and joined
the legions of the king.

55:15.062 --> 55:17.105
He never saw the woman again.

55:21.026 --> 55:23.237
However he still loves her.

55:30.369 --> 55:31.995
I am speaking of women.

55:35.582 --> 55:37.125
We will ride to Paris.

55:44.174 --> 55:45.467
Move on.

55:45.551 --> 55:47.427
Move on.

55:51.139 --> 55:52.891
Planchet, take the horses
into that barn.

55:57.563 --> 55:59.064
Who goes there?

55:59.147 --> 56:01.608
In Richelieu's name,
stop or I'll fire!

56:02.943 --> 56:05.279
Guards!
Surround that barn!

56:05.362 --> 56:06.655
Get to the loft!

56:18.625 --> 56:20.627
D'Artagnan!
Will you surrender?

56:22.462 --> 56:24.631
I drank too much.

56:24.715 --> 56:26.383
Come out!

56:28.260 --> 56:29.595
Oh, my headache!

56:29.678 --> 56:31.471
Come out,
or we'll burn the barn.

56:33.640 --> 56:35.058
Cease firing.

56:35.142 --> 56:36.602
D'Artagnan.

56:36.685 --> 56:38.854
If we shouldn't meet again.

56:38.937 --> 56:40.731
I believe I was drinking
this morning.

56:40.814 --> 56:45.277
I have a way of concocting
fairy tales when I drink.

56:45.360 --> 56:47.404
- You remember that.
- Are we to surrender?

56:47.487 --> 56:50.198
No, wait here two minutes
and then you will be free.

56:50.282 --> 56:52.659
And the gates of Paris open.

56:52.743 --> 56:55.829
Come along, Planchet.
There must be two of us.

56:55.913 --> 56:57.706
They will take you
for D'Artagnan.

56:57.789 --> 56:59.583
We'll spend the night
in the Bastille.

57:15.474 --> 57:17.768
Is Her Majesty
never going to appear?

57:17.851 --> 57:19.394
I told you all I know.

57:19.478 --> 57:22.689
She sent word she's not
feeling well. Sight of food.

57:22.773 --> 57:24.441
But the supper
is almost finished.

57:24.524 --> 57:26.443
Well,
maybe when the dancing begins.

57:26.526 --> 57:28.070
What a pity!

57:28.153 --> 57:30.364
And I have
a little gift for her.

57:32.407 --> 57:34.076
When she does appear,
Your Majesty,

57:34.159 --> 57:37.955
without the set of 12 studs
that were your gift to her.

57:38.038 --> 57:40.707
Then I ask her
who stole these from her?

58:28.964 --> 58:30.674
I'm ready now.

58:30.757 --> 58:33.010
But, Your Majesty,
without the jewels you can't...

59:56.968 --> 59:58.136
D'Artagnan!

1:00:12.442 --> 1:00:15.862
The jewels, Madame.

1:00:15.946 --> 1:00:19.324
I suspected you might have need
of some jewels, Your Majesty.

1:00:19.407 --> 1:00:20.617
And so I...

1:00:32.629 --> 1:00:34.548
I am heartbroken, Louis.

1:00:34.631 --> 1:00:37.259
I had no time to display
the jewels properly.

1:00:37.342 --> 1:00:39.511
My dressmaker arrived too late.

1:00:39.594 --> 1:00:41.263
Your dressmaker,

1:00:41.346 --> 1:00:43.140
Madame D'Artagnan no doubt.

1:00:43.223 --> 1:00:44.975
But I am all confused.

1:00:45.058 --> 1:00:46.685
Where did you get those two
studs?

1:00:46.768 --> 1:00:48.478
He said they were stolen.

1:00:48.562 --> 1:00:51.815
Our great Prime Minister
reduced to stealing?

1:00:51.898 --> 1:00:54.067
Perhaps we better
increase his allowance.

1:00:54.151 --> 1:00:56.820
Yes.

1:00:56.903 --> 1:01:00.574
You may give them
to me just the same.

1:01:00.657 --> 1:01:02.951
My profound compliments.

1:01:03.034 --> 1:01:04.744
Dispose of them as you will.

1:01:30.395 --> 1:01:31.897
Where can we go?

1:01:31.980 --> 1:01:34.524
I can't leave
the palace tonight.

1:01:34.608 --> 1:01:36.860
Tomorrow, somewhere.

1:01:44.576 --> 1:01:45.785
My gratitude.

1:02:02.385 --> 1:02:04.012
I kissed the queen's hand.

1:02:04.095 --> 1:02:05.972
Have you no higher ambitions?

1:02:08.642 --> 1:02:12.062
Tomorrow night.
Eight o'clock at Centraud.

1:02:12.145 --> 1:02:13.605
The Inn of the Flowers.

1:02:41.716 --> 1:02:44.427
All the things
I go through for you, master.

1:02:44.511 --> 1:02:46.280
No sooner did they let me out
of the Bastille,

1:02:46.304 --> 1:02:49.391
then here I am,
wearing your clothes.

1:02:49.474 --> 1:02:51.059
I almost prefer the Bastille.

1:02:51.142 --> 1:02:52.894
Ah, Planchet,
we must be careful.

1:02:52.978 --> 1:02:55.146
Maybe Richelieu
is planning revenge.

1:02:56.231 --> 1:02:57.649
If we run into an ambush,

1:02:57.732 --> 1:02:59.734
surely his men will
mistake you for me.

1:02:59.818 --> 1:03:02.320
Oh, yes, that's true.

1:03:02.404 --> 1:03:03.631
Oh, what are you saying, master?

1:04:05.175 --> 1:04:06.777
You may hang me
if you desire.

1:04:06.801 --> 1:04:09.262
But I call upon you to witness
that I surrender freely,

1:04:09.346 --> 1:04:11.514
voluntarily of my own choice.

1:04:11.598 --> 1:04:14.267
Because I cannot stomach
the kind of justice

1:04:14.351 --> 1:04:16.519
that takes the woman
and lets the man go free.

1:04:16.603 --> 1:04:18.855
The man surpasses
even your description of him.

1:04:18.938 --> 1:04:20.231
It's unbelievable.

1:04:20.315 --> 1:04:22.317
You will release
Mademoiselle Borassieu.

1:04:22.400 --> 1:04:24.652
I bargain with you, sir,
my life for hers.

1:04:26.154 --> 1:04:27.906
Why should I want your life?

1:04:30.492 --> 1:04:33.578
- You don't want me?
- Of course I want you.

1:04:33.661 --> 1:04:36.247
I want you as a lieutenant
in my guard.

1:04:47.258 --> 1:04:50.762
Young man, I can't afford to
have you as my enemy. It's true.

1:04:50.845 --> 1:04:53.556
You bring the affairs of state
to a complete halt.

1:04:53.640 --> 1:04:56.434
But hang you?
What a waste.

1:04:56.518 --> 1:04:59.771
No, a man like you, D'Artagnan,
brings out but one thing in me.

1:04:59.854 --> 1:05:01.564
- My inquisitive instinct.
- Monsieur, I--

1:05:01.648 --> 1:05:04.859
You are an ambitious man or you
wouldn't have come to Paris.

1:05:04.943 --> 1:05:07.195
May I suggest that in
your allegiance to the throne,

1:05:07.278 --> 1:05:10.615
you have joined your ambitions
with a falling star.

1:05:10.698 --> 1:05:12.992
<i>Monsieur,</i> I didn't come here
prepared...

1:05:13.076 --> 1:05:14.828
I came here about
a certain young lady.

1:05:14.911 --> 1:05:16.329
Oh, yes.

1:05:16.413 --> 1:05:19.082
Why don't we speak of her
another time.

1:05:19.165 --> 1:05:23.044
Some time perhaps after you have
accepted my commission.

1:05:23.128 --> 1:05:24.963
The Countess de Winter.

1:05:26.881 --> 1:05:30.343
Oh, here!
You two haven't met.

1:05:30.427 --> 1:05:32.846
The Countess de Winter.
<i>Monsieur</i> D'Artagnan.

1:05:39.185 --> 1:05:41.729
Or have you met?

1:05:41.813 --> 1:05:44.774
I am extremely interested
in this young man, My Lady.

1:05:44.858 --> 1:05:48.111
I wonder if you would be so good
as to entertain him.

1:05:48.194 --> 1:05:49.988
Give him a glimpse perhaps

1:05:50.071 --> 1:05:52.407
of the kind society
that would be his,

1:05:52.490 --> 1:05:55.076
if he accepts a lieutenancy
in my guard.

1:06:20.852 --> 1:06:21.978
Athos!

1:06:23.271 --> 1:06:25.648
Aramis! Porthos!

1:06:25.732 --> 1:06:29.068
Careful! Our friend Porthos
has a very tender heart.

1:06:31.154 --> 1:06:33.531
Aramis! They told me
you'd entered a monastery.

1:06:33.615 --> 1:06:34.717
I thought
I wouldn't see you again.

1:06:34.741 --> 1:06:36.242
It's only been a few days, man.

1:06:36.326 --> 1:06:38.203
Ah, a great deal can happen
in a few days,

1:06:38.286 --> 1:06:40.246
to change a man's life.

1:06:40.330 --> 1:06:42.290
It seems, my friends,
I'm not yet prepared

1:06:42.373 --> 1:06:45.585
to embrace the life
of the spirits.

1:06:45.668 --> 1:06:48.004
But I expected every hour that
you'd be joining me

1:06:48.087 --> 1:06:49.589
in the Bastille.

1:06:49.672 --> 1:06:52.884
Richelieu took Constance
instead.

1:06:52.967 --> 1:06:55.345
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

1:06:55.428 --> 1:06:57.722
Richelieu knows. Rochefort.

1:06:57.805 --> 1:06:59.057
Countess de Winter, I think.

1:06:59.140 --> 1:07:00.975
Oh, the famous countess again.

1:07:01.059 --> 1:07:02.727
Has anybody ever met her?

1:07:02.810 --> 1:07:05.813
Oh, yes. I've been seeing
quite a bit of her lately.

1:07:05.897 --> 1:07:08.233
Oh, now, gentlemen,
don't misunderstand me.

1:07:08.316 --> 1:07:11.945
I-- I love Constance.
How I love her.

1:07:12.028 --> 1:07:14.948
My time with My Lady has been
spent in polite conversation.

1:07:16.533 --> 1:07:17.992
Don't you believe me?

1:07:20.912 --> 1:07:22.247
He makes love to one woman

1:07:22.330 --> 1:07:24.415
in order to make love
to another woman.

1:07:24.499 --> 1:07:28.169
No, gentlemen. All I want of
My Lady is her confidence.

1:07:28.253 --> 1:07:31.047
Believe me. We spoke of horses
and Gascony.

1:07:31.130 --> 1:07:33.007
The most notorious woman
in France.

1:07:33.091 --> 1:07:35.134
The woman that not even
Buckingham could resist.

1:07:35.218 --> 1:07:39.514
The most dangerous, fascinating,
appetizing, tantalizing.

1:07:39.597 --> 1:07:42.976
And all he wants is her
confidence.

1:07:43.059 --> 1:07:45.478
I'm only seeing My Lady to find
out where Constance is.

1:07:45.562 --> 1:07:47.313
Poor Constance.

1:07:47.397 --> 1:07:49.708
Fifty francs he's in love with
My Lady by the end of the week.

1:07:49.732 --> 1:07:52.819
What a swine. He doesn't know
what it is to be in love.

1:07:52.902 --> 1:07:54.904
Why, when a man's in love
he's safe from anything.

1:07:54.988 --> 1:07:57.532
Oh, oh, you country boy.

1:07:57.615 --> 1:07:59.325
You know, I almost believe him.

1:07:59.409 --> 1:08:01.202
Fifty francs
with the end of the week?

1:08:01.286 --> 1:08:03.997
I believe him,
but not fifty francs worth.

1:08:04.080 --> 1:08:07.709
You poor, corrupt creatures.
Well, you'll see.

1:08:07.792 --> 1:08:10.878
She hasn't
the slightest appeal for me.

1:08:10.962 --> 1:08:13.381
If only I had some
slight appeal for her,

1:08:13.464 --> 1:08:15.466
I might find where Constance is,
but...

1:08:15.550 --> 1:08:19.387
No, My Lady despises me.
She considers me a bore.

1:08:19.470 --> 1:08:21.723
Oh, and worse, she's in love
with another man.

1:08:21.806 --> 1:08:23.099
But desperately.

1:08:23.182 --> 1:08:24.583
All she can think of
is where is he,

1:08:24.642 --> 1:08:26.436
why doesn't he come to see her?

1:08:26.519 --> 1:08:29.856
I've made so little progress,
I've been reduced to her maid.

1:08:29.939 --> 1:08:32.817
Don't tell me
you're making love to her maid.

1:08:32.900 --> 1:08:35.570
- Delicious! Delicious!
- No.

1:08:35.653 --> 1:08:37.447
No, if I've flirted
with Kitty a little

1:08:37.530 --> 1:08:38.948
it's only to intercept

1:08:39.032 --> 1:08:40.950
My Lady's correspondence
with this other man.

1:08:41.034 --> 1:08:42.869
D'Artagnan,
how can you get mixed up

1:08:42.952 --> 1:08:44.287
with so many different women,

1:08:44.370 --> 1:08:46.914
and still be in love
with somebody else?

1:08:46.998 --> 1:08:50.710
My poor, fickle friends,
you'll never understand.

1:08:50.793 --> 1:08:53.296
Wait, if-- if all you do
care about is Constance,

1:08:53.379 --> 1:08:54.964
why don't you
just go to this other man?

1:08:55.048 --> 1:08:56.591
Certainly the Countess
confides in him.

1:08:56.674 --> 1:08:58.009
Excellent, excellent.

1:08:58.092 --> 1:08:59.570
Except that the other man
unfortunately,

1:08:59.594 --> 1:09:01.387
is a certain Count de Wardes,

1:09:01.471 --> 1:09:03.681
whom I left in Calais
in very poor condition

1:09:03.765 --> 1:09:06.559
with four sword passes
through the body.

1:09:06.643 --> 1:09:09.312
Oh, how can fate be so cruel?

1:09:10.772 --> 1:09:11.898
Kitty!

1:09:13.441 --> 1:09:15.068
Cruel fate!

1:09:23.576 --> 1:09:25.703
Why don't you kiss me? Hmm?

1:09:28.122 --> 1:09:33.086
Ah, Kitty, my precious.
My beloved, my dove, my all.

1:09:33.169 --> 1:09:36.589
Oh, you don't care about me.

1:09:36.673 --> 1:09:39.550
All you care about
is my mistress.

1:09:39.634 --> 1:09:42.011
Well, she doesn't
care about you.

1:09:42.095 --> 1:09:43.721
This is the man
she's in love with.

1:09:43.805 --> 1:09:46.015
The Count de Wardes.

1:09:46.099 --> 1:09:49.352
No, I have to take that to him.

1:09:49.435 --> 1:09:51.896
I've been taking letters
to his house for days now.

1:09:51.979 --> 1:09:54.065
- And he never answers.
- Well, of course he doesn't.

1:09:54.148 --> 1:09:56.484
- He isn't at his house.
- How do you know?

1:09:56.567 --> 1:09:57.860
Well, he's a good friend
of mine.

1:09:57.944 --> 1:09:59.195
Here, let's see what she says.

1:09:59.278 --> 1:10:01.781
Oh! Oh, give it to me,
give it to me.

1:10:01.864 --> 1:10:03.658
Oh, I'm not...

1:10:03.741 --> 1:10:05.868
"My undying love, my..."

1:10:05.952 --> 1:10:08.204
Oh, you're right, Kitty.
She does love him.

1:10:10.081 --> 1:10:13.167
My, my. "Why don't you
answer my letters?"

1:10:13.251 --> 1:10:17.088
"Come to me, I beg...“

1:10:17.171 --> 1:10:18.589
I wonder...

1:10:20.800 --> 1:10:22.677
Could I do it?

1:10:22.760 --> 1:10:24.320
Oh, won't you please
give me the letter?

1:10:24.387 --> 1:10:26.764
Kitty.
Kitty, this man, this De Wardes.

1:10:26.848 --> 1:10:29.600
Does she confide in him?
Oh, she must.

1:10:29.684 --> 1:10:33.104
Oh, Kitty, stop squealing.
I'm only trying to help you.

1:10:33.187 --> 1:10:35.940
Look, you tell your mistress
you delivered the letter.

1:10:36.023 --> 1:10:38.276
- But I didn't.
- Never mind that.

1:10:38.359 --> 1:10:40.069
Tell her the Count begs
forgiveness,

1:10:40.153 --> 1:10:42.822
but he's in hiding.
He's in trouble with Richelieu.

1:10:42.905 --> 1:10:44.383
It was through him that
<i>Monsieur</i> D'Artagnan

1:10:44.407 --> 1:10:45.950
got to England.

1:10:46.033 --> 1:10:48.494
And that Richelieu has given out
an order for his arrest.

1:10:48.578 --> 1:10:49.787
Is this true?

1:10:49.871 --> 1:10:51.372
Well, more or less.
More or less.

1:10:51.456 --> 1:10:53.308
And then tell your mistress
that the Count de Wardes

1:10:53.332 --> 1:10:54.810
will sup with her at midnight
tonight.

1:10:54.834 --> 1:10:56.419
On one condition,

1:10:56.502 --> 1:10:59.130
that there is no light burning
anywhere in the house.

1:10:59.213 --> 1:11:00.506
- No lights?
- Ohh.

1:11:00.590 --> 1:11:03.593
If he's recognized
by one person he's lost.

1:11:03.676 --> 1:11:05.386
Tell her that he's afraid of
running into

1:11:05.470 --> 1:11:07.388
the terrible D'Artagnan.

1:11:07.472 --> 1:11:09.432
Oh! Oh, I don't understand.

1:11:09.515 --> 1:11:12.059
I, I mean, I mean suppose
he doesn't come

1:11:12.143 --> 1:11:13.478
and then she'll be
angry with me.

1:11:13.561 --> 1:11:15.980
There, there.
Now, Kitty, don't worry.

1:11:16.063 --> 1:11:17.982
Didn't I say he'd come?
He's a friend of mine.

1:11:18.065 --> 1:11:20.276
Yes, yes.
But you said he was afraid.

1:11:20.359 --> 1:11:23.154
My Kitty. My darling.

1:11:23.237 --> 1:11:25.615
My precious. My darling.

1:11:25.698 --> 1:11:28.576
There, there. Now run along.

1:11:28.659 --> 1:11:31.829
And don't forget,
tonight at midnight.

1:11:31.913 --> 1:11:33.456
And no lights!

1:12:02.527 --> 1:12:04.111
Every light, Kitty. Hurry!

1:12:04.195 --> 1:12:05.863
- Yes, My Lady.
- Oh, this is insane!

1:12:05.947 --> 1:12:08.866
I could just as we" pull
the drapes. No one can see.

1:12:08.950 --> 1:12:11.869
- Kitty, did he act insane?
- Ah, no, My Lady.

1:12:11.953 --> 1:12:14.205
Well, never mind.
Every light.

1:12:14.288 --> 1:12:16.999
Oh, if he doesn't come...
If you've made a mistake...

1:12:21.003 --> 1:12:22.547
Kitty, the wine is warm
from the fire.

1:12:22.630 --> 1:12:24.006
Take it and chill it.

1:12:24.090 --> 1:12:25.842
And the chocolate, it's cold.
Warm it.

1:12:25.925 --> 1:12:26.944
But there isn't a light
in the house.

1:12:26.968 --> 1:12:28.970
Do as I say!

1:12:38.020 --> 1:12:40.064
Put out that light!

1:12:40.147 --> 1:12:41.482
<i>Monsieur</i> D'Artagnan!

1:12:43.192 --> 1:12:45.945
- Where's My Lady?
- In her sitting room.

1:12:46.028 --> 1:12:47.822
Where's the Count de Wardes?

1:12:47.905 --> 1:12:49.240
Is the room dark?

1:12:49.323 --> 1:12:51.325
There's a fire.
They're eating by firelight.

1:12:51.409 --> 1:12:53.077
Afire?
I said no light.

1:12:53.160 --> 1:12:56.414
But it's only a little fire.
You can't see a thing.

1:12:56.497 --> 1:12:58.457
You'd better be
right about that.

1:12:58.541 --> 1:13:00.209
I don't understand.

1:13:00.293 --> 1:13:01.919
I don't understand one thing.

1:13:02.003 --> 1:13:04.589
Ah, ah, ah. Now, Kitty,
go and announce me.

1:13:04.672 --> 1:13:06.716
The Count de Wardes.

1:13:06.799 --> 1:13:08.217
The Count?

1:13:12.346 --> 1:13:15.391
Come, come, Kitty.
This is no time for weak nerves.

1:13:15.474 --> 1:13:18.394
Now go.
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

1:13:22.231 --> 1:13:25.067
The Count de,
the Count de Wardes.

1:13:26.694 --> 1:13:30.406
Oh, Constance, Constance,
understand me.

1:13:30.489 --> 1:13:33.659
This is just for conversational
purposes.

1:13:41.250 --> 1:13:43.586
De Wardes.

1:13:43.669 --> 1:13:45.212
De Wardes, at last.

1:13:45.296 --> 1:13:47.423
- At last.
- How sweet to see you.

1:13:47.506 --> 1:13:51.135
Ah, supper! How nice!

1:13:51.218 --> 1:13:52.887
Never mind about supper.

1:13:52.970 --> 1:13:54.931
A man grows hungry, My Lady.

1:13:56.599 --> 1:13:59.101
Kiss me! Kiss me!

1:13:59.185 --> 1:14:02.980
I shall positively be cremated
sitting so close to the fire.

1:14:05.399 --> 1:14:07.902
Are you going to kiss me
or aren't you?

1:14:07.985 --> 1:14:11.447
Well, perhaps one little kiss.

1:14:19.080 --> 1:14:21.958
I think maybe
we'd better eat supper.

1:14:26.212 --> 1:14:28.881
Wake up, Athos.
Athos, wake up.

1:14:31.342 --> 1:14:33.094
Oh, no.

1:14:36.973 --> 1:14:40.685
Come on, Athos, wake up.
Help me to compose a letter.

1:14:40.768 --> 1:14:43.646
You wake me up?
It isn't even noon yet.

1:14:45.356 --> 1:14:49.402
This is no hour
for composing letters

1:14:49.485 --> 1:14:50.903
or looking happy.

1:14:52.196 --> 1:14:54.031
Will you stop looking happy?

1:14:54.115 --> 1:14:57.660
Oh, Athos,
we've judged her unfairly.

1:14:57.743 --> 1:14:59.704
How can I describe her?

1:14:59.787 --> 1:15:01.622
- Her hair like...
- Who?

1:15:01.706 --> 1:15:03.249
- Oh, her lips--
- Who?

1:15:03.332 --> 1:15:04.333
Her throat like--

1:15:04.417 --> 1:15:05.918
Open your eyes, so you can see

1:15:06.002 --> 1:15:08.921
who you're talking about.

1:15:09.005 --> 1:15:10.172
My Lady.

1:15:11.882 --> 1:15:14.802
I can't describe her very well.
It was dark.

1:15:14.885 --> 1:15:16.679
She even gave me a ring.

1:15:16.762 --> 1:15:19.015
Ah, you're a carnival fellow.

1:15:19.098 --> 1:15:21.308
I resent your tone, Athos.

1:15:21.392 --> 1:15:23.102
You've fallen in love with her.

1:15:23.185 --> 1:15:26.022
I tell you,
we've judged her unfairly.

1:15:26.105 --> 1:15:30.276
You know, there's a certain
difficulty about this ring.

1:15:30.359 --> 1:15:33.779
She gave it to me under the
impression that I was De Wardes.

1:15:33.863 --> 1:15:35.906
A man wants to be loved
for himself and...

1:15:35.990 --> 1:15:37.009
Well, that's why
you've got to help me

1:15:37.033 --> 1:15:38.868
compose some kind of a letter.

1:15:41.328 --> 1:15:42.955
Give me that ring.

1:15:43.039 --> 1:15:44.165
What is it?

1:15:45.708 --> 1:15:47.293
What's the matter, Athos?

1:15:52.173 --> 1:15:55.259
I don't understand you.
That's a very beautiful ring.

1:15:58.596 --> 1:15:59.930
Yes.

1:16:01.348 --> 1:16:02.933
It once was mine.

1:16:05.895 --> 1:16:09.273
Athos, this is a crude
sort of joke.

1:16:09.356 --> 1:16:13.152
There are things that
a man doesn't joke about.

1:16:13.235 --> 1:16:15.488
I'd know that ring
if I found it in my grave.

1:16:15.571 --> 1:16:17.156
It belonged to my family.

1:16:19.241 --> 1:16:21.202
It was a wedding gift
to my wife.

1:16:21.285 --> 1:16:23.913
- Your wife?
- The Countess de Winter.

1:16:26.874 --> 1:16:30.711
Oh, heaven, how can you play
such a hideous trick on me?

1:16:30.795 --> 1:16:33.589
How can you play
such a trick on me?

1:16:33.672 --> 1:16:39.428
On her shoulder there's a,
a brand. A <i>fleur-de-lis.</i>

1:16:39.512 --> 1:16:40.655
But of course,
you wouldn't know that.

1:16:40.679 --> 1:16:42.389
Oh, this is monstrous.

1:16:42.473 --> 1:16:44.308
What kind of
drunken fantasy is this?

1:16:44.391 --> 1:16:46.560
My friend, believe me.
This woman is my wife.

1:16:46.644 --> 1:16:48.687
- I told you the story.
- Of your friend.

1:16:48.771 --> 1:16:51.065
No, no, of myself, of myself!

1:16:53.317 --> 1:16:55.653
I lied.

1:16:55.736 --> 1:16:57.696
Look, shun this woman
like you would the pox.

1:16:57.780 --> 1:17:00.616
She's evil itself.
She's death. She's poison!

1:17:00.699 --> 1:17:02.827
You liar.

1:17:02.910 --> 1:17:04.745
Why do you try to turn me
against her?

1:17:04.829 --> 1:17:08.332
What's your purpose?
Your words proclaim your lie.

1:17:08.415 --> 1:17:12.169
When you told me the story,
you said you still loved her.

1:17:12.253 --> 1:17:16.048
Are these the sentiments of a
man who still loves a woman?

1:17:16.132 --> 1:17:17.967
Oh, you drunken fool!

1:17:18.050 --> 1:17:20.302
Because you hate all women,
must I?

1:17:25.975 --> 1:17:27.911
Are you sure this is
the Count's real handwriting?

1:17:27.935 --> 1:17:31.021
Oh, yes. I intercepted
that letter only today.

1:17:31.105 --> 1:17:34.066
Ah, Aramis,
you write a fine hand.

1:17:34.150 --> 1:17:37.403
"My Lady, I find myself unable
to come to you again

1:17:37.486 --> 1:17:39.405
this evening as promised.“

1:17:39.488 --> 1:17:41.240
"Since my return from England

1:17:41.323 --> 1:17:44.451
I have so many invitations of
this kind on my hands

1:17:44.535 --> 1:17:47.413
that I am forced to
regulate them a little."

1:17:47.496 --> 1:17:49.206
"When your turn comes again,

1:17:49.290 --> 1:17:52.126
I shall have the honor to
inform you of it."

1:17:52.209 --> 1:17:53.878
"I kiss your hands."

1:17:53.961 --> 1:17:55.462
Now sign it De Wardes.

1:17:57.256 --> 1:18:00.426
Well, she certainly can't be
too fond of De Wardes now.

1:18:03.220 --> 1:18:07.057
But, Aramis, what's going to
make her fond of me?

1:18:24.950 --> 1:18:26.911
You! Get out of my room!

1:18:26.994 --> 1:18:28.204
<i>Monsieur</i> D'Artagnan.

1:18:28.287 --> 1:18:29.788
He is waiting
in the sitting room.

1:18:29.872 --> 1:18:31.975
Well, get him out of the house.
Tell him I can't see...

1:18:31.999 --> 1:18:33.459
No. No, wait.

1:18:36.837 --> 1:18:40.507
<i>Monsieur</i> D'Artagnan,
the famous swordsman.

1:18:42.384 --> 1:18:44.511
Kitty, prepare me.

1:19:07.660 --> 1:19:09.411
<i>Monsieur</i> D'Artagnan.

1:19:11.830 --> 1:19:12.998
Huh?

1:19:14.917 --> 1:19:16.335
Oh.

1:19:21.006 --> 1:19:24.051
- How handsome you are.
- Oh.

1:19:24.134 --> 1:19:27.846
My Lady, beside you,
I'm a, I'm a sparrow.

1:19:29.223 --> 1:19:30.766
Charming.

1:19:40.693 --> 1:19:45.364
Oh, My Lady, I'm overwhelmed.
I, I have no words.

1:19:45.447 --> 1:19:47.449
What need has a man of action
for words?

1:19:47.533 --> 1:19:49.785
Huh?

1:19:49.868 --> 1:19:53.831
- My, what a strong hand.
- It's yours.

1:19:58.335 --> 1:20:01.338
Don't you think it's
a little bright in here?

1:20:01.422 --> 1:20:02.798
Hmm?

1:20:13.809 --> 1:20:15.769
The light is still in my eyes.

1:20:29.450 --> 1:20:34.163
Oh, I find you in my arms.
My own arms.

1:20:36.457 --> 1:20:40.627
I mean...
Tell me you love me.

1:20:40.711 --> 1:20:42.838
- If only my heart were free.
- Huh?

1:20:42.921 --> 1:20:45.632
Free of anger.
Free of fear.

1:20:45.716 --> 1:20:49.636
Fear? Oh, My Lady,
whom are you afraid of?

1:20:49.720 --> 1:20:52.056
What do I live for,
except your command?

1:21:00.898 --> 1:21:05.277
What would you do to a man,
who holds my life in bondage?

1:21:05.361 --> 1:21:11.158
Who persecutes me? Reviles me?
Soils my honor and boasts of it.

1:21:12.368 --> 1:21:13.869
Name him.

1:21:13.952 --> 1:21:16.455
Speak his name
and you sentence him to death.

1:21:17.956 --> 1:21:19.583
- Count de Wardes.
- Ah...

1:21:20.959 --> 1:21:22.586
Who?

1:21:22.669 --> 1:21:24.963
Oh.

1:21:25.047 --> 1:21:27.466
Oh, yes, the Count de Wardes.

1:21:27.549 --> 1:21:29.009
You're afraid of him.

1:21:30.969 --> 1:21:32.554
Oh, My Lady.

1:21:32.638 --> 1:21:34.098
Well, if you love me.

1:21:34.181 --> 1:21:37.559
Well, that's not the question.
Do you love me?

1:21:37.643 --> 1:21:39.978
Oh, My Lady, to kill a man. I...

1:21:40.062 --> 1:21:44.108
No matter what my reputation,
I don't take killing lightly.

1:21:44.191 --> 1:21:47.444
Why only yesterday
you were cool to me.

1:21:47.528 --> 1:21:49.196
Cool to you?

1:21:49.279 --> 1:21:50.489
You'll never know the agony

1:21:50.572 --> 1:21:53.242
it caused me, sitting here,
cool.

1:21:53.325 --> 1:21:55.619
While you talked about horses.

1:21:55.702 --> 1:21:59.081
And I yearned to throw myself
into your arms.

1:21:59.164 --> 1:22:01.250
Oh, I can't believe this.

1:22:03.335 --> 1:22:05.379
And afterwards, after you left,

1:22:05.462 --> 1:22:07.423
to have to receive
the filthy De Wardes,

1:22:07.506 --> 1:22:09.341
to pretend out of fear.

1:22:09.425 --> 1:22:12.344
- My Lady.
- Do I love you?

1:22:12.428 --> 1:22:14.096
Like the stars in the night.

1:22:14.179 --> 1:22:18.767
The sun, the day, now,
tomorrow, forever.

1:22:18.851 --> 1:22:22.938
My heart is yours, constantly.
Irrevocably yours.

1:22:23.021 --> 1:22:25.357
And yours alone.

1:22:25.441 --> 1:22:27.443
Whatever my reputation,

1:22:27.526 --> 1:22:30.529
my D'Artagnan,
I don't take love lightly.

1:22:42.040 --> 1:22:45.794
Oh, if I had only known.

1:22:45.878 --> 1:22:49.214
Oh, My Lady.
I'm unworthy of you.

1:22:49.298 --> 1:22:51.842
The things I have done
and had to do.

1:22:51.925 --> 1:22:54.178
It's I who am unworthy of you.

1:22:54.261 --> 1:22:58.348
Oh, no, My Lady.
Let me put your heart at rest.

1:22:58.432 --> 1:23:00.392
It was not
the Count De Wardes you hate

1:23:00.476 --> 1:23:02.269
who came to you last night.

1:23:03.437 --> 1:23:06.273
Oh, forgive me.
Forgive me.

1:23:06.356 --> 1:23:08.025
I know you will.

1:23:14.656 --> 1:23:16.992
Don't you think it's
a little bright in here?

1:23:20.787 --> 1:23:23.415
- My Lady?
- Oh, you foul, sickening...

1:23:29.880 --> 1:23:31.924
Oh, when have
I taken so little pleasure

1:23:32.007 --> 1:23:33.133
in wrestling with women?

1:23:33.217 --> 1:23:34.801
Oh, you...

1:23:44.603 --> 1:23:47.231
I'll kill you, I'll kill you.

1:23:47.314 --> 1:23:50.275
Why am I a woman?
Why haven't I the strength?

1:24:00.160 --> 1:24:01.662
Oh!

1:24:01.745 --> 1:24:04.498
D'Artagnan, you are destroyed!

1:24:04.581 --> 1:24:06.416
Guards! Guards! Please!

1:24:14.007 --> 1:24:15.634
Kill him! Kill him!

1:24:54.423 --> 1:24:56.675
He does rather
well for a farm boy. Hm.

1:24:56.758 --> 1:25:00.262
So this is how he spends his
time in polite conversation.

1:25:00.345 --> 1:25:02.055
Shall we intrude?

1:25:28.415 --> 1:25:30.208
She has promised to kill you.

1:25:30.292 --> 1:25:32.252
She'll keep that promise
if she can.

1:25:33.170 --> 1:25:34.463
Beware, D'Artagnan.

1:25:34.546 --> 1:25:37.466
Beware of strange men
in dark places,

1:25:37.549 --> 1:25:40.010
and lonely roads.

1:25:40.093 --> 1:25:42.596
That woman will destroy you
because she must.

1:25:43.555 --> 1:25:45.307
You know her secret.

1:25:45.390 --> 1:25:48.352
Brand of a common criminal.
The <i>fleur-de-lis.</i>

1:25:48.435 --> 1:25:51.938
All I know is what I have done.
I'm unspeakable.

1:25:52.814 --> 1:25:55.275
No.

1:25:55.359 --> 1:25:56.818
Merely young.

1:25:59.112 --> 1:26:01.448
You could be so much worse off.

1:26:03.533 --> 1:26:05.160
She could be your wife.

1:26:28.433 --> 1:26:30.727
- Constance.
- No, it isn't a miracle.

1:26:30.811 --> 1:26:32.312
The queen found me.

1:26:34.064 --> 1:26:37.109
Oh, my love.
Speak to me.

1:26:37.192 --> 1:26:39.152
Darling, we have so little time.

1:26:39.236 --> 1:26:41.780
Oh, my angel of goodness.

1:26:41.863 --> 1:26:44.658
Will you marry me?
Now, this instant.

1:26:44.741 --> 1:26:47.494
- I can't. There is no time.
- Oh, you must.

1:26:47.577 --> 1:26:50.038
The queen's carriage,
it's coming for me.

1:26:50.122 --> 1:26:52.290
She's sending me where
Richelieu can't find me.

1:26:53.291 --> 1:26:54.584
I'll follow you.

1:26:54.668 --> 1:26:56.545
I don't even know
where she is sending me.

1:26:58.213 --> 1:27:01.133
Oh, Constance, Constance.

1:27:01.216 --> 1:27:04.302
Whether there's time or whether
there isn't, for my sake.

1:27:33.582 --> 1:27:35.375
I have to leave soon.

1:27:39.129 --> 1:27:40.922
Where I'll be, I don't know.

1:27:42.924 --> 1:27:45.844
What may happen to you?
We don't know.

1:27:47.804 --> 1:27:49.473
You're afraid, aren't you?

1:27:51.475 --> 1:27:54.811
Oh, I didn't know
you could be afraid.

1:27:54.895 --> 1:27:57.230
Now you know
everything about me.

1:27:58.982 --> 1:28:02.068
No, it's just that sometimes
I know how young I am,

1:28:02.152 --> 1:28:04.029
and how much I have to live for.

1:28:05.405 --> 1:28:07.449
I tremble, I...

1:28:07.532 --> 1:28:10.660
I can make mistakes
that will follow me

1:28:10.744 --> 1:28:12.496
through all my days.

1:28:14.623 --> 1:28:17.501
My Lady?

1:28:17.584 --> 1:28:20.712
If I can forgive you,
certainly she can.

1:28:22.172 --> 1:28:23.590
Oh, you don't know her.

1:28:24.716 --> 1:28:26.218
Oh, my darling.

1:28:30.931 --> 1:28:33.141
Well, that's only the sun.

1:28:43.276 --> 1:28:45.278
- Yes?
- Your carriage is here.

1:28:55.831 --> 1:28:58.333
Wherever you are.

1:28:58.416 --> 1:28:59.709
Wherever I am.

1:29:23.775 --> 1:29:26.027
Your Grace.

1:29:26.111 --> 1:29:27.831
Welcome to Grandstogen Castle,
<i>mademoiselle.</i>

1:29:27.904 --> 1:29:29.823
- You'll be safe here.
- Thank you, Your Grace.

1:29:29.906 --> 1:29:31.801
Within a few hours you will be
separated from Richelieu

1:29:31.825 --> 1:29:34.452
by the most impenetrable of
all barriers, the war.

1:29:49.009 --> 1:29:50.009
Fire!

1:29:52.429 --> 1:29:53.805
Fire!

1:29:58.226 --> 1:29:59.811
- Ah!
- Attack!

1:30:02.480 --> 1:30:03.481
Fire!

1:30:56.076 --> 1:30:58.054
D'Artagnan, go back.
Tell His Majesty another road.

1:30:58.078 --> 1:30:59.746
We'll hold this one
as long as we can.

1:31:06.920 --> 1:31:09.547
- Come out!
- That's no English voice.

1:31:09.631 --> 1:31:10.799
We're Frenchman!

1:31:10.882 --> 1:31:12.634
Come out, Frenchmen.

1:31:16.805 --> 1:31:18.431
Identify yourselves.

1:31:18.515 --> 1:31:20.684
Men of the king's musketeers,
sir.

1:31:20.767 --> 1:31:22.447
What are men of the king's
musketeers doing

1:31:22.519 --> 1:31:24.729
in this vicinity?

1:31:24.813 --> 1:31:25.897
Richelieu.

1:31:25.981 --> 1:31:27.524
So I'm going to have His Majesty

1:31:27.607 --> 1:31:29.651
on my hands soon.

1:31:29.734 --> 1:31:32.237
If I let these men go,
news of our little expedition

1:31:32.320 --> 1:31:34.322
will reach His Majesty
within the hour.

1:31:35.907 --> 1:31:37.659
Musketeers.

1:31:37.742 --> 1:31:39.911
I find myself abroad
on this dark night

1:31:39.995 --> 1:31:41.788
with insufficient escort.

1:31:41.871 --> 1:31:44.666
But His Majesty has...

1:31:44.749 --> 1:31:47.168
- We're at your command, sir.
- Good.

1:31:47.252 --> 1:31:50.213
There's a village yonder,
and an inn, the Dragon Rouge.

1:31:50.296 --> 1:31:52.507
One of you out front,
two behind!

1:32:09.024 --> 1:32:11.359
My own men will
stand guard outside.

1:32:11.443 --> 1:32:12.944
Give my trusted friends
here a room

1:32:13.028 --> 1:32:14.821
downstairs with a decent fire.

1:32:14.904 --> 1:32:16.740
Gentlemen, you may have my room.

1:32:16.823 --> 1:32:18.700
I put in a new stove only today.

1:32:18.783 --> 1:32:21.619
Good. And landlord,
lock their door.

1:32:21.703 --> 1:32:23.621
Let them out only
in case of trouble.

1:32:43.683 --> 1:32:47.270
<i>Monsieur,</i> would you
be kind enough to inform me

1:32:47.353 --> 1:32:50.190
of the reason for
the secrecy of this meeting.

1:32:50.273 --> 1:32:52.168
It's imperative that
no one here suspect

1:32:52.192 --> 1:32:54.527
I have had anything to do
with your leaving.

1:32:54.611 --> 1:32:56.071
I have arranged it, therefore,

1:32:56.154 --> 1:32:57.882
that not long after
I go out of this building

1:32:57.906 --> 1:33:00.408
men will appear
and kidnap you by force.

1:33:00.492 --> 1:33:02.094
They won't know that
you're going willingly

1:33:02.118 --> 1:33:04.829
of course, so I'd advise you
not to resist them.

1:33:04.913 --> 1:33:06.539
They will put you on a boat.

1:33:06.623 --> 1:33:08.708
By morning you will
be in England.

1:33:08.792 --> 1:33:10.728
You will then proceed to
Buckingham's headquarters

1:33:10.752 --> 1:33:14.380
at Grandstogen Castle
and appear before him.

1:33:14.464 --> 1:33:16.925
Well, after the affair of
the diamond studs, impossible.

1:33:17.008 --> 1:33:19.260
Since the affair of the diamond
studs Buckingham knows

1:33:19.344 --> 1:33:21.846
at least that you're
in my absolute confidence.

1:33:21.930 --> 1:33:24.599
You will present yourself
to Buckingham, My Lady, openly,

1:33:24.682 --> 1:33:25.892
as my negotiator.

1:33:25.975 --> 1:33:27.811
My Lady.

1:33:27.894 --> 1:33:29.771
Do I understand,
the great Richelieu

1:33:29.854 --> 1:33:31.648
is preparing
to negotiate a peace?

1:33:32.649 --> 1:33:34.025
You do, My Lady.

1:33:37.737 --> 1:33:40.406
Buckingham is arranging
an alliance with Spain,

1:33:40.490 --> 1:33:42.283
with Austria, and with Lorraine.

1:33:42.367 --> 1:33:46.329
If he is successful,
then the days of my power...

1:33:46.412 --> 1:33:49.249
and your affluence are numbered.

1:33:49.332 --> 1:33:51.334
But what if he refuses
to negotiate?

1:33:52.585 --> 1:33:54.295
You disappoint me, My Lady.

1:33:54.379 --> 1:33:57.173
We play chess with the Gods,
not pussy wants a corner.

1:33:57.257 --> 1:33:59.342
Of course Buckingham
will refuse to negotiate.

1:33:59.425 --> 1:34:00.844
Well, what then?

1:34:00.927 --> 1:34:02.887
My Lady, where is your
famous imagination?

1:34:05.390 --> 1:34:07.851
Do you suggest I
have him assassinated?

1:34:07.934 --> 1:34:10.228
I suggest nothing.

1:34:10.311 --> 1:34:12.814
I merely rely on your
imagination.

1:34:12.897 --> 1:34:14.607
What are your terms?

1:34:14.691 --> 1:34:16.067
I shall need something from you.

1:34:16.151 --> 1:34:17.735
- Of course.
- In writing.

1:34:17.819 --> 1:34:19.237
A carte blanche.

1:34:19.320 --> 1:34:21.906
A carte blanche?
But you have my word.

1:34:21.990 --> 1:34:23.408
In writing.

1:34:34.752 --> 1:34:36.754
"It is by my order,
and for the good of the state

1:34:36.838 --> 1:34:39.966
that the bearer of this has
done what he has done."

1:34:40.049 --> 1:34:41.926
"Richelieu."

1:34:42.010 --> 1:34:44.220
This will be quite satisfactory.

1:34:44.304 --> 1:34:45.555
Shh! Listen.

1:34:45.638 --> 1:34:47.265
The rest is bargaining.

1:34:49.392 --> 1:34:51.436
My terms are simple.

1:34:51.519 --> 1:34:55.273
First, there is a certain estate
in the vicinity of Lille.

1:34:55.356 --> 1:34:57.650
A barony.

1:34:57.734 --> 1:35:00.945
It was renounced by its owner
quite some years ago.

1:35:01.029 --> 1:35:03.823
It now belongs to the throne.

1:35:03.907 --> 1:35:06.409
I want that estate,
and the title.

1:35:06.492 --> 1:35:08.745
That's easily done, My Lady.
What else?

1:35:08.828 --> 1:35:12.040
Second, and last...

1:35:12.123 --> 1:35:14.125
I want the head of
<i>Monsieur</i> D'Artagnan.

1:35:14.209 --> 1:35:17.045
Delivered to me preserved
in a small box.

1:35:17.128 --> 1:35:18.796
Oh, no, My Lady, well, that is,

1:35:18.880 --> 1:35:20.882
I haven't
yet given up hope for him.

1:35:20.965 --> 1:35:22.508
You may give up
hope for him now.

1:35:27.222 --> 1:35:29.474
His instructions were to let us
out in case of trouble.

1:35:29.557 --> 1:35:31.726
Nobody said we weren't to
start it ourselves.

1:35:31.809 --> 1:35:33.853
Gentlemen, quickly,
there seems to be trouble!

1:35:36.272 --> 1:35:37.482
Athos!

1:35:40.652 --> 1:35:42.403
The bargain?

1:35:42.487 --> 1:35:44.864
If he succeeds in England,
she gets D'Artagnan's head.

1:35:45.907 --> 1:35:47.909
No, wait.

1:35:47.992 --> 1:35:50.161
You and Porthos go on back
to camp with Richelieu.

1:35:50.245 --> 1:35:51.996
Find D'Artagnan.
Bring him here by morning.

1:35:53.164 --> 1:35:54.707
Leave the woman to me.

1:35:56.501 --> 1:35:57.877
Tell Richelieu
I'm scouting ahead.

1:36:02.507 --> 1:36:04.968
What happened?
Where is the other musketeer?

1:36:05.051 --> 1:36:06.070
I don't know
what happened, <i>monsieur.</i>

1:36:06.094 --> 1:36:07.345
Athos went on ahead.

1:36:07.428 --> 1:36:08.888
He, uh, he said
he'd scout around.

1:36:31.119 --> 1:36:33.746
I have a message from Richelieu.

1:36:33.830 --> 1:36:35.623
All is quiet,
you have nothing to fear.

1:36:35.707 --> 1:36:37.208
Good.

1:36:41.796 --> 1:36:44.215
Don't be afraid, Charlotte,

1:36:44.299 --> 1:36:46.676
I can neither kill you
nor take you away.

1:36:46.759 --> 1:36:48.219
Your kidnappers,
in a few minutes,

1:36:48.303 --> 1:36:50.263
would report to Richelieu
either your corpse

1:36:50.346 --> 1:36:52.098
or your disappearance.

1:36:58.479 --> 1:37:00.606
You, my dear wife,
fainting is neither

1:37:00.690 --> 1:37:02.442
becoming nor believable.

1:37:03.985 --> 1:37:05.570
Richelieu gave you
a certain paper,

1:37:05.653 --> 1:37:08.698
a carte blanche.

1:37:08.781 --> 1:37:11.284
Since I cannot kill you,
I must at least have that paper.

1:37:12.744 --> 1:37:15.079
No.

1:37:15.163 --> 1:37:16.473
You will give it to me,
Charlotte,

1:37:16.497 --> 1:37:18.041
or I shall have to take it.

1:37:18.124 --> 1:37:19.542
No!

1:37:59.665 --> 1:38:02.710
Help! Don't hit me!
I'm the landlord.

1:38:02.794 --> 1:38:05.171
Help! Help! Help!

1:38:05.254 --> 1:38:07.215
Stop that! Stop it!

1:38:07.298 --> 1:38:09.050
The lady you're
looking for is upstairs.

1:38:09.133 --> 1:38:10.635
Your orders are changed however.

1:38:10.718 --> 1:38:12.220
She is not
to be taken to the boat.

1:38:17.058 --> 1:38:19.227
Athos. Athos!

1:38:24.232 --> 1:38:25.566
Water.

1:38:25.650 --> 1:38:28.111
You could have
at least used wine.

1:38:33.199 --> 1:38:35.660
With the compliments
and apologies of the house.

1:38:37.161 --> 1:38:39.705
The compliments
and apologies of a man

1:38:39.789 --> 1:38:43.418
who has never appreciated
landlords before.

1:38:43.501 --> 1:38:45.211
D'Artagnan.

1:38:45.294 --> 1:38:46.879
- They've told you, huh?
- Yes.

1:38:46.963 --> 1:38:49.257
Well, none of us can
go to England. We're soldiers.

1:38:49.340 --> 1:38:51.759
If we're caught on English soil
we'll be hanged.

1:38:51.843 --> 1:38:53.469
I suggest Planchet
go to Buckingham.

1:38:53.553 --> 1:38:55.096
- Planchet?
- Hmm?

1:38:55.179 --> 1:38:56.806
You're going to England.

1:38:56.889 --> 1:38:58.141
Yes, master.

1:38:59.684 --> 1:39:01.269
I, oh, I, I...

1:39:01.352 --> 1:39:03.563
- I'll get shot!
- Unlikely.

1:39:03.646 --> 1:39:07.692
- Well, I, I'll get seasick.
- Undoubtedly.

1:39:07.775 --> 1:39:11.154
D'Artagnan, do you think that,
uh, Planchet is a...

1:39:11.237 --> 1:39:14.532
My faith in Planchet,
is my faith in a friend.

1:39:20.913 --> 1:39:22.290
I'll go, master.

1:39:22.373 --> 1:39:23.416
Well, just so you'll have

1:39:23.499 --> 1:39:26.210
no difficulty in traveling,

1:39:26.294 --> 1:39:28.880
Richelieu himself gives you
his blessing.

1:39:31.424 --> 1:39:33.009
Be back a week from today.

1:39:33.092 --> 1:39:34.802
My friends will be
in the French camp,

1:39:34.886 --> 1:39:36.345
but I may be in hiding.

1:39:36.429 --> 1:39:38.723
For if you fail, Richelieu
will be wanting my head.

1:39:39.640 --> 1:39:41.434
Now, tell Buckingham...

1:39:41.517 --> 1:39:43.019
Ah, this same woman,

1:39:43.102 --> 1:39:45.688
uh, who has been promised
my master's head,

1:39:45.771 --> 1:39:48.524
uh, comes to England,
not to assassinate,

1:39:48.608 --> 1:39:51.569
uh, uh, uh,
not to negotiate a peace,

1:39:51.652 --> 1:39:54.113
but to a-- assassinate you.

1:39:54.197 --> 1:39:56.866
Ah, then imprison her,
my master says.

1:39:56.949 --> 1:39:58.534
This is one
of Richelieu's tricks.

1:39:58.618 --> 1:40:01.120
Ah, uh, bind her. Chain her.

1:40:01.204 --> 1:40:04.332
Surround her with guards.
Pick from your most trusted men.

1:40:04.415 --> 1:40:07.710
Ah, she is evil itself.
Now, may I go back to France?

1:40:07.793 --> 1:40:11.214
How do I know you're not
one of Richelieu's tricks?

1:40:11.297 --> 1:40:13.799
Is there anyone in England
who can identify you?

1:40:13.883 --> 1:40:15.092
No, sir.

1:40:15.176 --> 1:40:16.385
- I, uh...
- Well?

1:40:16.469 --> 1:40:17.803
Oh! Oh, uh...

1:40:17.887 --> 1:40:20.723
My, my master says
that you will know this.

1:40:34.737 --> 1:40:36.989
This man has in his possession
the diamond stud

1:40:37.073 --> 1:40:38.824
which you once stole from me.

1:40:38.908 --> 1:40:42.036
But of course, Your Grace.
And which he stole from me.

1:40:42.119 --> 1:40:45.957
He was one of my servants.
Where have you been, Duval?

1:40:46.040 --> 1:40:48.292
I've been trying to find you,
to have you hanged.

1:40:48.376 --> 1:40:50.711
Hanged? Duval?

1:40:51.754 --> 1:40:54.632
My name is Planchet.

1:40:54.715 --> 1:40:57.218
Well, my master
is <i>Monsieur</i> D'Artagnan.

1:40:57.301 --> 1:40:59.971
Would you do me the favor of
having this creature hanged?

1:41:00.054 --> 1:41:01.722
Planchet!

1:41:01.806 --> 1:41:06.143
Oh, my sweet Planchet.
How is he? How is he?

1:41:06.227 --> 1:41:09.647
My Lady.
You're under arrest.

1:41:17.280 --> 1:41:19.424
The Countess de Winter, may I
present to you your jailer,

1:41:19.448 --> 1:41:21.075
<i>Mademoiselle Bonacieux.</i>

1:41:22.743 --> 1:41:24.120
You will have a company
of guards

1:41:24.203 --> 1:41:25.844
at your disposal,
my dear, but you will be

1:41:25.913 --> 1:41:28.249
responsible for this woman.

1:41:28.332 --> 1:41:29.875
You see,
you're a woman yourself,

1:41:29.959 --> 1:41:33.129
and safe from her
more obvious temptations.

1:41:33.212 --> 1:41:34.893
If she escapes you,
then you must know that

1:41:34.922 --> 1:41:36.549
I will be her first victim.

1:41:36.632 --> 1:41:39.093
And D'Artagnan,
the man you love, her second.

1:41:41.178 --> 1:41:42.597
I think you'll make
a better jailer

1:41:42.680 --> 1:41:44.223
than any man in England.

1:41:47.018 --> 1:41:48.477
Remove the prisoner.

1:42:47.620 --> 1:42:49.890
I haven't come to the best news.
I haven't come to it yet.

1:42:49.914 --> 1:42:51.040
<i>Ah, mademoiselle.</i>

1:42:52.708 --> 1:42:54.418
The lady who lived downstairs.

1:42:54.502 --> 1:42:55.812
- The lady you married.
- Constance?

1:42:55.836 --> 1:42:57.088
She's in England.

1:42:57.171 --> 1:42:59.090
- You saw her?
- Right in the castle!

1:42:59.173 --> 1:43:01.342
Oh, and the wit of
that <i>Monsieur</i> Buckingham.

1:43:01.425 --> 1:43:02.653
You know,
I had always thought that

1:43:02.677 --> 1:43:04.136
Englishmen weren't very bright.

1:43:04.220 --> 1:43:05.572
Well, you see,
there was some question

1:43:05.596 --> 1:43:07.074
as to who was to
be the My Lady's jailer.

1:43:07.098 --> 1:43:08.858
Never mind about that.
Tell me about my wife.

1:43:08.891 --> 1:43:10.726
But that's what I'm telling you.

1:43:10.810 --> 1:43:12.561
<i>He</i> made <i>mademoiselle</i> a jailer.

1:43:16.065 --> 1:43:17.692
But that's a funny story.

1:43:19.860 --> 1:43:21.529
Did I leave something out?

1:43:21.612 --> 1:43:23.864
Planchet, did he trust <i>Madame</i>

1:43:23.948 --> 1:43:25.533
<i>to mademoiselle</i> herself?

1:43:25.616 --> 1:43:27.451
Oh, there was
to be soldiers.

1:43:27.535 --> 1:43:29.745
He trusted Satan to an angel.

1:43:33.249 --> 1:43:35.626
Planchet, saddle my horse.

1:43:35.710 --> 1:43:37.920
D'Artagnan,
you can't go to England.

1:43:38.003 --> 1:43:39.564
- You'll be hanged.
- Buckingham will protect me.

1:43:39.588 --> 1:43:41.257
But you'll be
a deserter in France.

1:43:46.929 --> 1:43:48.264
I too, then!

1:43:56.355 --> 1:43:59.191
Oh.

1:43:59.275 --> 1:44:00.985
They didn't tell me
you were sick.

1:44:01.068 --> 1:44:03.154
- Let me undress you.
- No!

1:44:03.237 --> 1:44:04.447
- I'll call the surgeon.
- No!

1:44:04.530 --> 1:44:06.031
- I forbid it.
- My Lady, I...

1:44:06.115 --> 1:44:08.617
Pray for me. You're young.
You're good.

1:44:08.701 --> 1:44:11.412
He will listen to you.
He won't listen to me.

1:44:11.495 --> 1:44:13.581
Pray that I die.

1:44:13.664 --> 1:44:15.499
Is that what you've
been praying for?

1:44:15.583 --> 1:44:18.169
- To die?
- Yes.

1:44:19.837 --> 1:44:21.547
- I'll call the surgeon.
- No!

1:44:21.630 --> 1:44:25.176
Pray for me. That's all.
Oh, if you knew, you'd pray.

1:44:26.886 --> 1:44:30.055
Oh, leave me.
Leave me!

1:44:36.896 --> 1:44:40.775
- Ma'am, call the surgeon.
- She won't let me.

1:44:40.858 --> 1:44:43.652
There's nothing wrong with her
at all. She's just pretending.

1:44:43.736 --> 1:44:46.238
She knows if I call the surgeon,
he'll find out.

1:45:00.836 --> 1:45:02.922
- Yes.
- It's Alvin of the guard.

1:45:03.005 --> 1:45:04.590
My Lady wants you.

1:45:15.100 --> 1:45:17.061
- My Lady.
- Oh, mercy.

1:45:18.187 --> 1:45:19.563
Mercy, let me die.

1:45:20.898 --> 1:45:22.650
Let the surgeon see you.

1:45:31.659 --> 1:45:33.202
Let the surgeon see me?

1:45:34.286 --> 1:45:36.664
Let Buckingham know?

1:45:36.747 --> 1:45:39.500
He'll hang me.
Tomorrow, today.

1:45:42.253 --> 1:45:43.671
But I trust you.

1:45:45.381 --> 1:45:48.634
To be hanged.
A common criminal.

1:45:50.344 --> 1:45:51.929
An English noose.

1:45:55.099 --> 1:45:57.226
Have I ever lied to you?

1:45:57.309 --> 1:46:00.354
Have I ever pretended
to be anything but what I am?

1:46:00.437 --> 1:46:02.815
No.

1:46:02.898 --> 1:46:05.067
Your D'Artagnan...

1:46:05.150 --> 1:46:07.945
I'd kill him in an instant.

1:46:08.028 --> 1:46:10.281
And Buckingham,
that swine, I'd...

1:46:13.784 --> 1:46:15.536
I am what I am.

1:46:15.619 --> 1:46:18.414
And I have no concern with
your silly rights and wrongs.

1:46:20.082 --> 1:46:22.668
But heaven, heaven,
may I not have pride?

1:46:24.461 --> 1:46:27.006
Must I die at the end
of an English rope?

1:46:29.216 --> 1:46:30.718
I won't tell, I swear.

1:46:31.844 --> 1:46:35.389
Oh. A knife.

1:46:35.472 --> 1:46:38.017
Do you lay claim to goodness
or don't you?

1:46:38.100 --> 1:46:39.852
Are you merciful or are you not?

1:46:41.562 --> 1:46:43.188
Oh, save me.

1:46:43.272 --> 1:46:45.107
Bring me a knife.

1:46:45.190 --> 1:46:47.610
Let me end this.

1:46:47.693 --> 1:46:50.946
Oh, how do you stand there,
torturing me?

1:46:52.448 --> 1:46:54.992
Oh, oh, I can't endure.

1:46:55.993 --> 1:46:57.494
I can't.

1:47:28.233 --> 1:47:30.027
Let go of the anchor!

1:47:30.110 --> 1:47:31.820
There's home, there's England.

1:47:39.662 --> 1:47:41.330
<i>I'm, I'm Mademoiselle Bonacieux,</i>

1:47:41.413 --> 1:47:44.249
I, I have charge
of a certain prisoner.

1:47:44.333 --> 1:47:46.669
I'm-- I'm sick.

1:47:46.752 --> 1:47:48.629
I can't take further
responsibility.

1:47:48.712 --> 1:47:50.923
His Grace can't be disturbed.

1:47:51.006 --> 1:47:53.133
- Oh, but I must see him.
- Tomorrow perhaps.

1:47:53.217 --> 1:47:54.718
I'll give him the message.

1:48:16.699 --> 1:48:20.869
She's laying on the floor.
She's all doubled up, like...

1:48:20.953 --> 1:48:23.539
Ma'am, I take
my orders from you.

1:48:23.622 --> 1:48:26.208
But you're no officer
and I can tell you this,

1:48:26.291 --> 1:48:27.626
we don't treat no dog in England

1:48:27.710 --> 1:48:30.087
like you're treating her.

1:48:30.170 --> 1:48:32.423
- I'm going to the surgeon.
- No!

1:48:32.506 --> 1:48:33.924
Are there any
other guards on duty?

1:48:34.008 --> 1:48:35.592
- Yes, ma'am.
- Send them away.

1:48:35.676 --> 1:48:38.178
- But--
- You stay by her door.

1:48:38.262 --> 1:48:40.681
Close the peephole.

1:48:40.764 --> 1:48:43.434
I'll be with My Lady
in a few minutes.

1:48:43.517 --> 1:48:46.020
But I forbid you to watch
or to have anyone else around.

1:48:46.103 --> 1:48:47.229
Yes, ma'am.

1:48:49.523 --> 1:48:51.066
Will you send for the surgeon?

1:48:52.693 --> 1:48:54.778
I don't think
that will be necessary.

1:50:15.734 --> 1:50:17.069
My Lady.

1:50:20.489 --> 1:50:22.324
I, I brought you a book.

1:50:37.881 --> 1:50:40.134
Halt!

1:50:40.217 --> 1:50:41.969
Lieutenant St. Clair,
returning from France.

1:50:42.052 --> 1:50:43.887
I have urgent dispatches
for His Grace.

1:50:43.971 --> 1:50:45.990
Direct me please, to My Lord,
the Duke of Buckingham.

1:50:46.014 --> 1:50:48.016
I'll have to report to
the captain of the guard.

1:50:48.100 --> 1:50:49.476
Follow me, sir.

1:50:53.605 --> 1:50:55.482
Halt! Halt!

1:50:55.566 --> 1:50:58.318
Guards! Guards! Follow me!
Frenchmen in the castle!

1:50:58.402 --> 1:51:00.654
Spies! Spies!
Soldiers, after them!

1:51:00.737 --> 1:51:02.739
<i>Ah, yes, Mademoiselle Bonacieux.</i>

1:51:02.823 --> 1:51:04.241
You came earlier I believe.

1:51:04.324 --> 1:51:06.118
His Grace was disturbed
by your message

1:51:06.201 --> 1:51:08.829
and asked that if you returned,
you be admitted.

1:51:08.912 --> 1:51:10.205
That door.

1:51:20.841 --> 1:51:22.443
Frenchmen in the castle.
Report to your corporal.

1:51:22.467 --> 1:51:22.926
Yes, sir!

1:51:23.010 --> 1:51:23.927
Which way to the
prisoner's quarter?

1:51:24.011 --> 1:51:26.221
- Up the stairs.
- His Grace has been murdered!

1:51:26.305 --> 1:51:28.015
Buckingham has been murdered!

1:51:28.098 --> 1:51:29.183
Frenchmen in the castle!

1:51:29.266 --> 1:51:30.475
Frenchmen in the castle!

1:51:30.559 --> 1:51:31.852
Follow me, men!

1:51:39.443 --> 1:51:40.736
Constance.

1:51:44.031 --> 1:51:45.490
Athos!

1:51:48.035 --> 1:51:49.453
Constance, my wife.

1:51:50.412 --> 1:51:51.496
My wife.

1:52:01.590 --> 1:52:02.841
My Constance.

1:52:07.179 --> 1:52:09.389
We will never have time.

1:52:09.473 --> 1:52:11.600
Oh, you're smiling.

1:52:11.683 --> 1:52:15.187
Oh, yes, we'll have time.
Of course we'll have time.

1:52:15.270 --> 1:52:17.689
Now, look at me.
Look at me.

1:52:19.107 --> 1:52:20.651
Keep looking at me.

1:52:22.402 --> 1:52:24.655
You and I

1:52:24.738 --> 1:52:26.990
we'll have everything
you asked for.

1:52:27.074 --> 1:52:28.659
Time to be in love.

1:52:32.371 --> 1:52:33.747
Hold me.

1:52:37.501 --> 1:52:39.127
There...

1:52:39.211 --> 1:52:42.214
Oh, heaven, let me be strong
enough for the two of us.

1:53:13.912 --> 1:53:16.164
D'Artagnan.

1:53:16.248 --> 1:53:20.294
We have only a few seconds
and they'll come in this room.

1:53:20.377 --> 1:53:22.421
We have no Buckingham
to protect us now.

1:53:22.504 --> 1:53:25.590
- Oh, Constance.
- D'Artagnan.

1:53:25.674 --> 1:53:27.759
You must come.
There's nothing more you can do.

1:53:29.720 --> 1:53:31.430
Listen to me!

1:53:31.513 --> 1:53:33.473
De Winter is still alive!

1:54:03.170 --> 1:54:05.464
Frenchmen! Frenchmen!

1:54:31.907 --> 1:54:33.241
I advise you, D'Artagnan,

1:54:33.325 --> 1:54:34.993
to lose yourself
on the road to Spain.

1:54:35.077 --> 1:54:37.329
Richelieu has given orders
for your arrest.

1:54:37.412 --> 1:54:38.997
As for the woman, forget her.

1:54:39.081 --> 1:54:41.124
You ask the impossible.

1:54:41.208 --> 1:54:43.668
This woman has assassinated
the Prime Minister of England.

1:54:43.752 --> 1:54:45.003
Murdered D'Artagnan's wife.

1:54:45.087 --> 1:54:46.254
What do you propose to do?

1:54:46.338 --> 1:54:47.756
Find her.

1:54:47.839 --> 1:54:49.674
We lost her somewhere
on the road to Lille.

1:54:49.758 --> 1:54:51.885
We merely asking you,
has she been in Paris?

1:54:51.968 --> 1:54:54.137
Athos, this woman
is protected by Richelieu.

1:54:54.221 --> 1:54:55.722
If you touch her...

1:54:55.806 --> 1:54:58.100
Gentlemen, are you aware of
what will happen to you?

1:54:58.183 --> 1:54:59.684
- To all of you?
- We are.

1:54:59.768 --> 1:55:01.353
Leave her, I beg of you,

1:55:01.436 --> 1:55:03.647
leave her to the justice
of the state.

1:55:03.730 --> 1:55:06.441
When there is no justice
in the state.

1:55:06.525 --> 1:55:08.276
She's not returned to Paris.

1:55:09.403 --> 1:55:11.154
The road to Lille.

1:55:11.238 --> 1:55:13.156
Athos, remember
the night you said

1:55:13.240 --> 1:55:15.534
the rest was bargaining?

1:55:15.617 --> 1:55:17.327
Lille, an estate near Lille?

1:55:17.411 --> 1:55:19.204
A Barony?

1:55:19.287 --> 1:55:22.040
She demanded the estate,
and the title.

1:55:36.972 --> 1:55:39.850
Is this more or less beautiful
than Gascony,

1:55:39.933 --> 1:55:41.268
I wouldn't know.

1:55:43.395 --> 1:55:45.105
Here, I grew up.

1:55:46.773 --> 1:55:49.151
These woods, these hills.

1:55:50.235 --> 1:55:51.862
All this was mine.

1:55:51.945 --> 1:55:54.072
And more, D'Artagnan, more.

1:55:56.074 --> 1:55:57.868
Here, I fell in love.

1:56:07.878 --> 1:56:09.004
Is it she?

1:56:10.088 --> 1:56:11.298
Yes.

1:56:11.381 --> 1:56:13.133
Well, Athos,
in a matter of hours,

1:56:13.216 --> 1:56:16.511
we'll be on the road to Spain
with a price on our heads.

1:56:19.097 --> 1:56:21.099
Will we live
to see France again?

1:56:22.476 --> 1:56:24.269
Will we live to see Spain?

1:56:47.375 --> 1:56:48.710
No!

1:56:48.793 --> 1:56:51.046
No! No!

1:56:51.922 --> 1:56:54.382
No! No! No!

1:57:16.613 --> 1:57:19.783
This was my family's chapel,
Charlotte.

1:57:19.866 --> 1:57:22.202
You remember,
we took our vows here?

1:57:23.912 --> 1:57:27.374
I loved you, Charlotte.
I still love you.

1:57:27.457 --> 1:57:31.503
I love you as I love war
and drunkenness.

1:57:31.586 --> 1:57:34.673
I love you as men love all
that is worst for them.

1:57:36.925 --> 1:57:38.635
Forgive me, Robert.

1:57:38.718 --> 1:57:40.053
Before God and this Holy place

1:57:40.136 --> 1:57:42.305
I swear, I swear.

1:57:46.017 --> 1:57:48.019
The executioner of Lille.

1:57:51.398 --> 1:57:52.941
Mercy!

1:57:53.024 --> 1:57:55.026
You cannot...
Gentlemen, mercy.

1:57:56.486 --> 1:57:58.530
How many times
have you asked for mercy

1:57:58.613 --> 1:58:00.156
and you received it?

1:58:00.240 --> 1:58:02.784
And then repaid it in blood?

1:58:02.867 --> 1:58:04.911
How many times have you
taken men's love,

1:58:04.995 --> 1:58:08.498
their pity, their aspirations,

1:58:08.582 --> 1:58:11.209
and their lives?

1:58:11.293 --> 1:58:13.378
What has been
the essence of your evil?

1:58:14.546 --> 1:58:16.548
That you understood goodness.

1:58:18.300 --> 1:58:20.510
We don't forgive you, Charlotte.
We can't.

1:58:21.761 --> 1:58:23.513
We do not dare.

1:58:38.778 --> 1:58:40.363
My wife.

2:00:27.887 --> 2:00:29.931
They should remember
you here, Athos.

2:00:31.057 --> 2:00:32.726
My appetite, anyway.

2:00:38.231 --> 2:00:39.566
Food, landlord.

2:00:39.649 --> 2:00:42.152
And wine, landlord,
in the king's name!

2:00:42.235 --> 2:00:44.154
The king's musketeers?

2:00:44.237 --> 2:00:46.114
Yes, <i>Monsieur</i> Athos.

2:00:46.197 --> 2:00:48.241
The best food and wine
for <i>Monsieur</i> Athos.

2:00:48.324 --> 2:00:50.243
This is a trap!

2:02:04.901 --> 2:02:06.820
Aramis, chandelier!

2:02:32.846 --> 2:02:34.597
D'Artagnan! Come on, Porthos!

2:02:37.016 --> 2:02:38.268
D'Artagnan!

2:02:39.060 --> 2:02:40.436
Athos, hurry!

2:02:57.745 --> 2:03:00.081
We come into a time of peace,
Your Majesty.

2:03:00.164 --> 2:03:03.042
The British retired from
La Rochelle. The war has ended.

2:03:03.126 --> 2:03:05.962
We mourn our dead, and forgive.

2:03:06.045 --> 2:03:07.589
Forgive these men, sire.

2:03:08.756 --> 2:03:10.008
I have here their resignations

2:03:10.091 --> 2:03:12.010
from the musketeers.

2:03:12.093 --> 2:03:15.263
Aramis will embrace
the life of the spirit.

2:03:15.346 --> 2:03:18.725
Porthos, I believe
he states here his intention,

2:03:18.808 --> 2:03:20.268
or at least his ambition,

2:03:20.351 --> 2:03:22.145
to marry a rich widow.

2:03:22.228 --> 2:03:24.647
D'Artagnan will return
to Gascony.

2:03:24.731 --> 2:03:26.941
Athos, to the province
of his birth.

2:03:27.942 --> 2:03:29.986
Grant them peace, sire,

2:03:30.069 --> 2:03:31.321
and forgiveness.

2:03:31.404 --> 2:03:33.197
It is I, Treville,
who have forgiven.

2:03:33.281 --> 2:03:35.283
I have forgiven treason
and treachery

2:03:35.366 --> 2:03:38.411
because I admire an honest
cutthroat as much as any man.

2:03:38.494 --> 2:03:39.930
But with the murder
of the Countess de Winter

2:03:39.954 --> 2:03:41.956
these men have set themselves
above the state.

2:03:42.040 --> 2:03:43.541
But she assassinated Buckingham.

2:03:43.625 --> 2:03:45.293
You know that.
I know it too.

2:03:45.376 --> 2:03:47.921
It was an abysmal crime,
whoever was responsible.

2:03:48.004 --> 2:03:50.924
- But I-- I--
- I am the state, Your Majesty.

2:03:51.007 --> 2:03:52.467
Let us say it now, privately,

2:03:52.550 --> 2:03:55.803
so that we never have need
to discuss it in public.

2:03:55.887 --> 2:03:58.473
I'm France, Louis.
I am the state.

2:03:58.556 --> 2:04:00.475
These men have set
themselves above me,

2:04:00.558 --> 2:04:02.936
and it is I, Louis,
and not you who sit in judgment.

2:04:04.103 --> 2:04:05.897
I render that judgment now.

2:04:12.570 --> 2:04:14.072
What have you there?

2:04:14.155 --> 2:04:17.909
"It is by my order
and for the good of the state,

2:04:17.992 --> 2:04:22.080
that the bearer of this has done
what he has done."

2:04:22.163 --> 2:04:24.499
Signed, "Richelieu."

2:04:31.089 --> 2:04:32.882
That's a forgery.

2:04:34.509 --> 2:04:35.635
This isn't theirs!

2:04:35.718 --> 2:04:37.387
I gave this paper to...

2:04:37.470 --> 2:04:39.055
To whom, Richelieu?

2:04:49.232 --> 2:04:51.567
Did I understand
that you were about to

2:04:51.651 --> 2:04:54.195
render a royal judgment?

2:04:54.278 --> 2:04:55.863
In my humble capacity

2:04:55.947 --> 2:04:58.449
as the throne's first minister,
Your Majesty.

2:04:58.533 --> 2:05:02.578
I was about to
offer my suggestions,

2:05:02.662 --> 2:05:05.790
that we allow <i>Monsieur</i> Aramis
to enter a monastery.

2:05:05.873 --> 2:05:07.667
That we discover, if possible,

2:05:07.750 --> 2:05:10.628
a rich widow
for <i>Monsieur</i> Porthos.

2:05:10.712 --> 2:05:12.839
That we restore
to the Baron <i>de la Fere,</i>

2:05:12.922 --> 2:05:16.050
if he wishes them,
his lands and title.

2:05:16.134 --> 2:05:18.886
And as for <i>Monsieur</i> D'Artagnan,

2:05:18.970 --> 2:05:21.139
don't let him go back
to Gascony.

2:05:21.222 --> 2:05:24.934
Send him perhaps on a mission
of peace to England.

2:05:25.018 --> 2:05:27.020
The English lead
too dull a life.

2:05:29.731 --> 2:05:31.065
Dismissed!
