<i>Last night, the greatest
season of "The Voice" yet kicked off</i>

00:06.851 --> 00:08.301
- <i>with the return of Season 12</i>
- Whoo!

00:08.325 --> 00:10.207
<i>champion coach Alicia Keys...</i>

00:10.208 --> 00:12.707
- I want to be on her team.
- Yes, Kelly!

00:12.708 --> 00:14.666
<i>...and the debut of new coach,</i>

00:14.667 --> 00:17.374
<i>Grammy-winning superstar
Kelly Clarkson...</i>

00:17.375 --> 00:20.124
♪ I can win with you ♪

00:22.792 --> 00:26.124
<i>...who proved to be more than
a match for our veteran coaches.</i>

00:26.125 --> 00:28.707
I'm smart as well as hot.

00:28.708 --> 00:30.541
<i>And changing "The Voice" forever</i>

00:30.542 --> 00:33.499
<i>was the arrival of The Block,</i>

00:33.500 --> 00:35.707
<i>giving each coach just one opportunity</i>

00:35.708 --> 00:38.720
<i>to block another coach from
getting an artist they want.</i>

00:38.745 --> 00:40.374
- Ooh!
- Oh, snap!

00:40.375 --> 00:42.207
<i>Blake was the first to strike...</i>

00:42.208 --> 00:44.249
- I got so blocked.
- I did block Adam.

00:44.250 --> 00:46.207
That was good!

00:46.208 --> 00:48.249
<i>...followed by Alicia,
who used her block</i>

00:48.250 --> 00:50.374
<i>to give Blake
a taste of his own medicine...</i>

00:50.375 --> 00:51.707
I know that's you!

00:51.708 --> 00:54.499
I did use my only block for you.

00:54.500 --> 00:56.541
Did you make
a snow angel in my "blocked"?

00:56.542 --> 00:57.874
<i>...leaving Adam and Kelly</i>

00:57.875 --> 01:00.499
<i>the only coaches still able to block.</i>

01:00.500 --> 01:02.541
Boop! Boop-boop-boop-boop!

01:02.566 --> 01:05.349
- <i>Tonight...</i>
- ♪ I don't see no emotion, and I... ♪

01:05.375 --> 01:07.707
<i>...the fight to get
the best artist on their team</i>

01:07.708 --> 01:10.374
<i>has our coaches going crazy...</i>

01:10.375 --> 01:12.082
I am country, and I'm proud of it!

01:12.083 --> 01:13.541
- Oh, gosh.
- And I'm serious about it!

01:13.542 --> 01:15.166
Okay. Okay, Blake!

01:15.167 --> 01:16.832
<i>...and doing things they've never done.</i>

01:16.833 --> 01:18.541
For the first time in my life,

01:18.542 --> 01:20.916
I pictured myself riding a unicorn.

01:20.917 --> 01:22.291
Obviously, he should be your coach.

01:22.292 --> 01:23.874
Come on.

01:23.875 --> 01:25.416
I've literally been waiting
to do "The Voice"

01:25.417 --> 01:27.124
for a few years now,
and I'm just so pumped

01:27.125 --> 01:28.624
by the talent we're seeing this season.

01:28.625 --> 01:30.374
The soulfulness separates you

01:30.375 --> 01:32.416
from what's happening
in music right now.

01:32.417 --> 01:34.374
You are outrageous.

01:34.375 --> 01:36.291
You see what you do to us?

01:36.292 --> 01:38.582
<i>Season 14 premiere week continues...</i>

01:38.583 --> 01:42.416
Did that feel good?
'Cause it felt good here.

01:42.559 --> 01:45.167
<i>...right now.</i>

01:48.167 --> 01:50.291
Second day, I figured y'all out,
your strategy.

01:50.292 --> 01:51.957
You're like, "I'm Oklahoman.
I'm a cowboy. Pick me."

01:51.958 --> 01:54.430
What is? Is that your impersonation?

01:54.455 --> 01:56.791
He's like "Country music is my life."

01:56.792 --> 01:58.582
And then Alicia, once she says,

01:58.583 --> 02:00.416
"I feel connected to you,"
you have no chance.

02:00.417 --> 02:03.332
What Adam does is, "I know
you're not gonna pick me."

02:03.333 --> 02:04.832
I know, and it's the reverse psychology.

02:04.833 --> 02:06.957
But they're agreeing with you
is what's sad.

02:06.982 --> 02:08.598
- You do that all the time.
- Do you guys not remember yesterday

02:08.622 --> 02:09.624
when I beat you

02:09.625 --> 02:11.332
- with a very, very good singer?
- Uh...

02:11.333 --> 02:13.291
So, wait a minute. What do you
think Kelly's tactic is?

02:13.292 --> 02:14.582
Here's what I think it is.

02:14.583 --> 02:15.916
"Blblblblblblblblblblblbl."

02:15.917 --> 02:17.624
Oh, my gosh!

02:17.625 --> 02:19.791
- "You're a great singer."
- Oh, my gosh.

02:19.792 --> 02:21.666
- Let's go do some blinds.
- Okay!

02:21.667 --> 02:23.315
- Okay.
- Okay.

02:24.109 --> 02:25.916
<i>Let's meet the first artist...</i>

02:25.917 --> 02:27.791
Thank you.

02:27.792 --> 02:30.791
<i>...23-year-old Davison
from Little Rock, Arkansas.</i>

02:30.792 --> 02:33.291
They make me feel so like a star.

02:33.292 --> 02:36.291
I was always the kid that couldn't wait

02:36.292 --> 02:37.999
to sing the Pledge of Allegiance.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.499
Is that it? No. The National Anthem.

02:40.500 --> 02:42.999
Uhhhhhhhh. Ah!

02:43.000 --> 02:45.041
Let me stop.

02:46.667 --> 02:48.999
I am super excited to be on this show.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.332
This is lights and camera and action.

02:51.333 --> 02:53.124
It's really big. In my hometown,

02:53.125 --> 02:56.041
there's not many opportunities
to become an artist.

02:56.042 --> 02:57.791
So, I'm a worship leader at my church,

02:57.792 --> 02:59.874
and as a hobby, I'm a local stylist.

02:59.875 --> 03:02.041
I love clothes.

03:02.042 --> 03:05.374
As a child, my mom would always
put me in the latest fashion,

03:05.375 --> 03:08.707
and from there, you know, I just
developed my own Davison style.

03:08.708 --> 03:11.541
Like, right now, I have on
red-and-white-striped pants.

03:11.542 --> 03:13.332
I mean, it looks good.
You would never think,

03:13.333 --> 03:15.999
- but he looks good with it.
- "You would never think"?

03:16.000 --> 03:17.499
- Mnh-mnh.
- Never think.

03:17.500 --> 03:19.832
Musically, I'm kind of gospel

03:19.833 --> 03:22.374
with a little bit of soul, with a little
bit of R&B, with a little bit of grit.

03:22.375 --> 03:23.999
I would love to work with Adam.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.499
I'm a fan of Blake.

03:27.917 --> 03:30.416
I would also like to work
with Alicia Keys.

03:30.417 --> 03:31.916
Kelly Clarkson... she's phenomenal.

03:31.917 --> 03:33.707
I like Blake.

03:33.708 --> 03:37.499
If Davison turn a chair,
this lady here gonna do a dance.

03:39.042 --> 03:42.082
I perform at local church events
and around town.

03:42.083 --> 03:44.666
My mom... she's at every performance,

03:44.667 --> 03:48.315
and I'm so grateful that she's
here to experience this with me.

03:48.490 --> 03:49.768
I'm feeling good, y'all.

03:51.006 --> 03:54.499
Even just to stand on
that stage is gonna be monumental.

03:54.500 --> 03:57.041
It's the opportunity of a lifetime.

03:57.042 --> 03:58.750
There he go.

05:43.042 --> 05:45.041
I was so close.

05:45.042 --> 05:48.207
Whoo! Whoo!

05:48.208 --> 05:49.999
Yeah!

05:50.000 --> 05:51.832
Wow.

05:51.833 --> 05:54.291
- Whoo!
- I'm going to kill you.

05:54.292 --> 05:55.832
Wow.

05:55.833 --> 05:57.874
- What's your name?
- My name is Davison,

05:57.875 --> 05:59.317
and I'm from Little Rock, Arkansas.

05:59.342 --> 06:00.666
- Ah!
- Yeah.

06:00.691 --> 06:02.440
- I'm out of my mind.
- Me too.

06:02.465 --> 06:03.966
- We were talking.
- Yes.

06:03.991 --> 06:07.079
Because, Davison, you are outrageous.

06:07.104 --> 06:09.041
Your voice is so beautiful,

06:09.042 --> 06:11.791
and it has this
storyteller energy to it.

06:11.792 --> 06:13.916
It just draws you in... boom...
right from the minute.

06:13.917 --> 06:16.082
You did a beautiful job.

06:16.083 --> 06:17.430
First of all, I love that song.

06:17.455 --> 06:19.249
- It's an old Bee Gees record.
- No, it's not.

06:19.274 --> 06:22.573
Bee Gees recorded it first,
and then Michael Bolton.

06:22.621 --> 06:24.914
- N... Oh.
- Oh, that's who I'm thinking. Yeah.

06:24.939 --> 06:26.714
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Yes.

06:26.739 --> 06:28.618
Look, it shocks me to say this.

06:28.643 --> 06:31.059
The first time he's known something
about music that I haven't.

06:32.683 --> 06:35.538
There's something so vintage
about your voice, man,

06:35.563 --> 06:37.162
that I just think it's magical.

06:37.187 --> 06:38.799
It sounds, like, classic, like vinyl.

06:38.800 --> 06:40.632
- Mm.
- Thank you.

06:40.633 --> 06:42.674
And then find out that you're
from Little Rock, Arkansas, man.

06:42.675 --> 06:45.049
- I have eaten at many...
- Hey, hey!

06:45.050 --> 06:47.966
...many a Taco Bell
in Little Rock, Arkansas.

06:47.967 --> 06:49.549
Oh, well, obviously
he should be your coach

06:49.550 --> 06:51.299
'cause he's been to a Taco Bell.

06:51.300 --> 06:53.007
I would be honored...

06:53.008 --> 06:54.591
"honor" is the word I'm using...

06:54.592 --> 06:56.591
to be your coach, man. I'm not kidding.

06:56.592 --> 06:58.232
Thank you so much.

06:58.257 --> 07:00.174
As would I. This is shocking.

07:00.175 --> 07:01.674
I'm still letting that sink in.

07:01.675 --> 07:03.549
Like, I still can't believe
that you know

07:03.550 --> 07:04.841
about any music outside of your sphere.

07:04.842 --> 07:06.091
Well, you clearly know about
Jimmy Buffett

07:06.092 --> 07:07.924
because you're wearing his shirt
in here today.

07:10.592 --> 07:13.257
You're so funny. You got
so many funny jokes, don't you?

07:15.050 --> 07:17.882
You kind of embody the whole
point of what this show is

07:17.883 --> 07:20.257
because I believe that
your voice speaks to all of us.

07:20.258 --> 07:22.591
It just instantly makes you feel.

07:22.592 --> 07:24.257
And I want you
to know something about me.

07:24.258 --> 07:26.591
Right before we made our first
album, I was listening to

07:26.592 --> 07:27.882
"The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill,"

07:27.883 --> 07:30.257
to soul records and R&B records.

07:30.258 --> 07:32.882
If that's the record you want
to make, I know who you are.

07:32.883 --> 07:35.091
And I think you could win "The Voice."

07:35.092 --> 07:37.882
All of the things and dreams
and aspirations that you want,

07:37.883 --> 07:40.049
I want to help bring
those things to life.

07:40.050 --> 07:42.424
- Thank you.
- I'm telling you right now,

07:42.425 --> 07:45.299
you will be
the centerpiece of Team Blake.

07:45.300 --> 07:47.882
That is my word to you.

07:49.883 --> 07:51.299
All right, you've heard both of them.

07:51.300 --> 07:53.091
Who are you gonna pick as your coach?

07:53.092 --> 07:55.216
Come on, man.

07:55.217 --> 07:56.966
Blake.

07:59.425 --> 08:01.716
Come on!

08:03.925 --> 08:05.924
You know you got to go with me, man.

08:05.925 --> 08:08.467
I love you both.

08:11.300 --> 08:13.175
But I pick...

08:14.967 --> 08:16.233
Come home.

08:17.462 --> 08:19.716
- ...Adam.
- Yeah!

08:21.923 --> 08:23.841
Davison, I think,
is gonna be a finalist.

08:23.842 --> 08:25.954
- Yes.
- He's got this soulful, church voice,

08:25.979 --> 08:28.019
and it's also old-school, new-school.

08:28.044 --> 08:29.636
He's got it all.

08:29.672 --> 08:32.297
- This show's rigged!
- Sorry.

08:35.342 --> 08:36.924
Nice job.

08:36.924 --> 08:38.424
Ahh!

08:38.424 --> 08:41.006
- You crushed her dreams.
- I wanted Adam so bad, like...

08:41.008 --> 08:43.424
- Yeah.
- But Blake was my man, you know.

08:43.424 --> 08:45.123
I had to choose Adam.

08:45.148 --> 08:48.314
The way he was describing me
to myself, he knows me.

08:48.339 --> 08:50.213
That should have been
four chairs, no problem.

08:50.238 --> 08:52.737
- We should have turned around.
- We... I messed up.

08:52.762 --> 08:56.094
I made a mistake.

08:56.175 --> 08:57.806
I don't know what's the matter with me,

08:57.831 --> 09:00.330
but I know another one is coming for me.

09:00.355 --> 09:02.417
That's where I benefit...
from huge mistakes.

09:02.442 --> 09:03.512
I'll give you that one.

09:03.537 --> 09:06.861

What just happened?

09:40.532 --> 09:42.334
♪ This is "The Voice" ♪

09:42.477 --> 09:44.397
<i>Welcome back to "The Voice."</i>

09:44.542 --> 09:45.957
If you think I talk a lot,

09:45.958 --> 09:47.874
y'all banter back and forth
for like an hour.

09:47.875 --> 09:50.082
- I can't even get a word in right now.
- You're a liar.

09:50.083 --> 09:51.957
I looked at her one moment,
and I was like, "They're still going."

09:51.958 --> 09:54.041
- It's all about efficiency.
- Ain't nothing efficient

09:54.042 --> 09:56.124
- about what happens between you two!
- Look, can we get started?

09:56.125 --> 09:57.791
It's the joke to make fun of Kelly

09:57.792 --> 09:59.457
'cause I talk so much and I talk fast.

09:59.458 --> 10:00.791
All right, I'll see y'all out here.

10:00.792 --> 10:01.916
No, wait. No, wait.
I want the last word.

10:01.917 --> 10:03.749
- Going to work.
- God!

10:03.750 --> 10:05.582
<i>Let's meet the next artist.</i>

10:05.583 --> 10:07.874
A couple years ago,
I was at a convention center,

10:07.875 --> 10:10.707
and there was this booth
that had a big "Voice" chair.

10:10.708 --> 10:12.457
I got in. It was like a joke.

10:12.458 --> 10:14.207
I just thought
I would never be on "The Voice."

10:14.208 --> 10:16.041
Like, I'm not good enough.

10:16.042 --> 10:18.832
And then... here I am.

10:20.125 --> 10:21.791
My name is Jaclyn Lovey.

10:21.792 --> 10:24.698
I am 16 years, and I'm from
Placerville, California.

10:24.785 --> 10:27.582
When I was 11, I started to write songs.

10:27.583 --> 10:30.124
And there are so many people
that inspired me,

10:30.125 --> 10:33.749
from Billie Holiday
and Hank Williams, Johnny Cash.

10:33.750 --> 10:35.166
And I think that's one of the reasons

10:35.167 --> 10:37.624
that my music is more unique.

10:37.625 --> 10:41.291
Placerville is a little town
in Northern California.

10:41.292 --> 10:43.166
Everyone kind of knows everyone,

10:43.167 --> 10:45.749
and they've been so supportive of me.

10:45.750 --> 10:49.791
They've donated a piano,
helped get my voice lessons.

10:49.792 --> 10:51.999
And when I wanted to make an E.P.,

10:52.000 --> 10:54.791
everyone I knew around me
was so generous.

10:54.792 --> 10:57.082
Through a crowdfunding platform,

10:57.083 --> 10:59.291
we were able to get
all the money we needed.

10:59.292 --> 11:01.582
I hope I make my community proud

11:01.583 --> 11:04.666
in return for everything
they've done for me.

11:04.667 --> 11:07.874
I need "The Voice"
because I'm very young

11:07.875 --> 11:10.999
and I want that next level of training.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.874
I've always gravitated towards
the more classical sound.

11:13.875 --> 11:15.957
A lot of people tell me I'm an old soul.

11:15.958 --> 11:17.999
So, for my blind audition, I am singing

11:18.000 --> 11:20.332
"Can't Help Falling in Love"
by Elvis Presley.

11:20.333 --> 11:23.999
Mm, I'm waiting for the magic.
The magic's on its way.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.791
When I see the real red chairs,

11:26.792 --> 11:28.707
it's just gonna come full circle.

11:28.708 --> 11:30.500
There's my princess.

Whoo!

13:29.483 --> 13:31.482
- Hello.
- What's your name?

13:31.483 --> 13:33.024
My name is Jaclyn Lovey.

13:33.025 --> 13:35.482
I'm 16, and I am from
Placerville, California.

13:35.483 --> 13:37.066
All right!

13:37.067 --> 13:39.482
I was not singing like that
when I was 16, so...

13:39.483 --> 13:41.524
I'm gonna tell you right now...

13:41.525 --> 13:43.149
no one on this show sounds like you.

13:43.150 --> 13:45.066
- No one has that vibe.
- I loved it.

13:45.067 --> 13:47.066
- No one in the world sounds like her.
- Thank you.

13:47.067 --> 13:48.732
I think sometimes
in this world, we feel like

13:48.733 --> 13:50.941
we have to over-perform everything,

13:50.942 --> 13:53.899
and it's really special
that you just showed everybody

13:53.900 --> 13:56.441
that you can be simple and pure.

13:56.442 --> 13:57.941
I loved listening to you sing.

13:57.942 --> 13:59.232
Thank you.

13:59.233 --> 14:02.107
Your voice makes you feel every word.

14:02.108 --> 14:05.066
And this is me talking.

14:05.067 --> 14:08.441
- You gave the Scarecrow a heart.
- A calloused country guy here.

14:08.442 --> 14:10.066
- The Tin Man.
- For the first time in my life...

14:10.067 --> 14:11.774
Or Tin Man.

14:11.775 --> 14:13.357
Or I'm the Scarecrow,
and I don't have a brain.

14:13.358 --> 14:15.399
You gave the Tin Man a heart.
I'm sorry. Continue.

14:19.525 --> 14:22.065
- You see what you do to us?
- I'm sorry.

14:22.090 --> 14:23.941
- We're... We're falling over ourselves.
- What just happened?

14:23.942 --> 14:26.441
Literally, for
the first time in my life,

14:26.442 --> 14:29.274
I pictured myself,
while you were singing,

14:29.275 --> 14:33.066
me riding a unicorn,
the kind that has, like, wings.

14:33.067 --> 14:34.982
That's the vibe I was trying to get.

14:35.007 --> 14:36.044
- And I was holding a Care Bear,
- Wow.

14:36.068 --> 14:37.274
had a Care Bear right here.

14:37.299 --> 14:40.965
It was like... Your voice is like,
"What is happening to me?

14:40.989 --> 14:42.170
- Blake.
- Where am I?"

14:42.171 --> 14:43.982
- Like, you did that to me, Jaclyn.
- You made a grown man do that.

14:43.983 --> 14:46.941
It's amazing how one man's dream
is another man's nightmare.

14:48.942 --> 14:51.149
And even though there's
vocalists in this competition

14:51.150 --> 14:53.274
that literally blow the roof off
this place,

14:53.275 --> 14:55.482
I think what you do
is more powerful than that.

14:55.483 --> 14:57.982
- Thank you.
- I've got to have you on my team.

14:57.983 --> 15:00.232
- Please, Jaclyn. I love you.
- Let me take over...

15:00.233 --> 15:03.566
...before you say
any other strange things.

15:03.567 --> 15:05.899
I'm pretty sure that unicorn comment

15:05.900 --> 15:07.566
- disqualified him immediately.
- Just being honest. I'm just being honest.

15:07.567 --> 15:12.149
Jaclyn, you know, I'm also a
huge lover of the classic songs.

15:12.150 --> 15:15.857
I really get it, and I see exactly
what we could do together.

15:15.858 --> 15:18.357
We'd be able to find songs
that suit your voice,

15:18.358 --> 15:19.982
just like this one did,

15:19.983 --> 15:21.691
and we'll keep it pure.
We'll keep it honest.

15:21.692 --> 15:24.316
We'll keep it genuine,
and it'll be all about you.

15:24.317 --> 15:27.524
So, I really would love
to do that with you.

15:27.525 --> 15:32.191
All right, I think it's time
for you to pick a coach.

15:32.192 --> 15:36.607
It's either Alicia Keys,
goddess of all things wonderful,

15:36.608 --> 15:40.024
or it's, uh, you know, the
unicorn whisperer over there.

15:44.692 --> 15:47.324
I would love to work with
either one of you, honestly.

15:51.207 --> 15:53.316
Um, but I pick...

15:57.233 --> 15:59.566
- ...Alicia.
- All right!

15:59.567 --> 16:01.691
Come on!

16:01.692 --> 16:03.357
I'm having a rough start right now,

16:03.358 --> 16:05.066
but I'm gonna make a comeback.

16:05.067 --> 16:06.422
- Congratulations to you.
- I'm sorry.

16:06.447 --> 16:10.501
Now I know that sharing what
goes on in my mind all the time

16:11.041 --> 16:13.092
probably isn't the thing to do.

myself sitting at the helm of,

like, the "Star Trek" Enterprise.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.166
- Like, I'm sitting like this.
- It's like a spaceship, right?

16:32.167 --> 16:34.332
- Yeah, it's like...
- Like "Beam up, Scotty."

16:34.333 --> 16:35.957
Not "Beam me up." What does he say?

16:35.958 --> 16:37.374
- I don't know.
- "Beam me up, Scotty."

16:37.375 --> 16:39.431
No. "Beam me up" is when
they're, like, on a planet.

16:39.503 --> 16:41.127
"Beam me... Beam me down, Scotty."

16:42.837 --> 16:45.627

"...to the board." I'm such a nerd.

16:54.795 --> 16:57.169

- That was tricky. I was close.

20:23.045 --> 20:25.711
It is so hard watching
good people go home,

20:25.712 --> 20:28.337
but I'm looking for something
that really moves me.

- "Her"?
- I don't know.

20:56.212 --> 20:58.336

20:58.337 --> 21:00.211
The genre that I think I'd put myself in

21:00.212 --> 21:02.211
is probably country,

21:02.212 --> 21:05.044
but I've gotten more
into the Americana realm.

21:05.045 --> 21:08.377
I think they both share
beautiful storytelling.

21:08.378 --> 21:10.377
I grew up in Macon, Georgia.

21:10.378 --> 21:12.544
My grandfather was a Baptist preacher.

21:12.545 --> 21:15.586
He had a TV show that aired
every single Christmas

21:15.587 --> 21:17.377
through the middle Georgia area.

21:17.378 --> 21:20.544
That's where I probably got
my first start singing.

21:20.545 --> 21:23.502
I knew that I was gay
when I was a very young kid.

21:23.503 --> 21:26.377
Being a Southern Baptist,
I thought that was a big sin

21:26.378 --> 21:28.044
and I was gonna go to hell for it.

21:28.045 --> 21:30.294
Coming out to my parents was tough.

21:30.295 --> 21:33.377
I don't think they knew how to take it.

21:33.378 --> 21:36.419
Even though my parents
haven't always seen eye to eye,

21:36.420 --> 21:38.294
we've come a really long way,

21:38.295 --> 21:41.211
and I'm so happy
they're here with me today.

21:41.212 --> 21:43.377
I moved to Nashville in 2010,

21:43.378 --> 21:46.044
and I started making music
and playing shows

21:46.045 --> 21:47.711
all around the Southeast.

21:47.712 --> 21:50.086
- How's it going? It's a grind, right?
- It is a grind, yes.

21:50.087 --> 21:52.294
I'm trying to get my break,
honestly, Carson.

21:52.295 --> 21:54.681
You're here. You got your break.

21:56.295 --> 21:58.627
I met Ashlee, my fiancée,

21:58.628 --> 22:01.212
about three years ago
in Raleigh, North Carolina.

22:01.237 --> 22:02.544
We both come from

22:02.545 --> 22:06.127
Southern Baptist family and
background, and we connected.

22:06.128 --> 22:08.794
It's so great to be here today,
and I'm so proud of Molly.

22:08.795 --> 22:10.294
I think she's worked really hard.

22:10.295 --> 22:12.127
And she's my best friend,

22:12.128 --> 22:15.169
and I am incredibly grateful
to have her by my side.

22:15.170 --> 22:17.502
Ashlee is a wonderful woman.

22:17.503 --> 22:19.794
We love her like another daughter.

22:19.795 --> 22:22.586
And I am so proud of Molly.

22:22.587 --> 22:25.461
She's finally getting some recognition

22:25.462 --> 22:28.336
that she very much deserves.

22:30.170 --> 22:33.127
My entire life, every adversity
that I've gone through,

22:33.128 --> 22:35.502
I've always come out stronger for it.

22:35.503 --> 22:37.252
And I believe that, today,

22:37.253 --> 22:39.795
I'm gonna come out stronger
because I'm a fighter.

24:42.545 --> 24:44.919
Molly Stevens from Macon, Georgia,

24:44.920 --> 24:46.752
and I live in Raleigh,
North Carolina, now.

24:46.753 --> 24:48.627
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

24:48.628 --> 24:50.461
You know anything about North Carolina?

24:50.462 --> 24:52.294
My family's here.
They're from North Carolina.

24:52.295 --> 24:53.919
All right! Way to go.

24:53.920 --> 24:56.419
- Do you know who sang that song?
- Molly. Molly just sang it.

24:56.420 --> 24:57.505
- No, you don't!
- Yes!

24:57.529 --> 24:58.668
I know who sang that song.

24:58.670 --> 25:00.002
That's one of my favorite
singer/songwriters.

25:00.003 --> 25:02.086
- Sweet. Me too. Yes!
- Patty Griffin, girl.

25:02.087 --> 25:04.836
- Do you want to do soulful country/rock?
- Yeah, country, Americana.

25:04.837 --> 25:06.086
- Come on.
- Yeah.

25:06.087 --> 25:07.502
Oh, gosh.

25:07.503 --> 25:08.961
Okay, well, I've won country awards,

25:08.962 --> 25:10.586
and I, you know... Patty Griffin...

25:10.587 --> 25:12.419
Why are you selling yourself
to me? Talk to her.

25:12.420 --> 25:14.419
People only believe,
if you're country on this show,

25:14.420 --> 25:16.627
that Blake can help you,
but that is not true.

25:16.628 --> 25:18.461
I have had no help from Blake,

25:18.462 --> 25:20.269
and I have been successful
in country music.

25:20.294 --> 25:24.752
I'm just saying. Thank you. Thank you.

25:24.753 --> 25:26.499
My life is country music.

25:26.524 --> 25:28.857
I don't go from one genre to the next.

25:28.882 --> 25:30.961
- I stay in one lane.
- You know what?

25:30.986 --> 25:33.351
I am country and I'm proud
of it, and that's all I do!

25:33.376 --> 25:36.002
- I can't help it. I can't help it.
- That's all I do!

25:36.003 --> 25:38.002
- All right, wait.
- And I'm serious about it!

25:38.003 --> 25:40.669
- Okay, Blake. Okay, hold on.
- I'm serious!

25:43.212 --> 25:46.461
I cannot help
that I love all genres of music.

25:46.462 --> 25:50.461
Who here has one genre of music on
your iPhone that you listen to?

25:50.462 --> 25:51.836
- No one.
- I do.

25:51.837 --> 25:53.711
You are a damn liar.
I've seen your iPhone.

25:53.712 --> 25:55.627
- I'm country. I'm damn country.
- You love Duran Duran.

25:55.628 --> 25:57.544
I have the "Ghostbusters II" soundtrack,

25:57.545 --> 25:59.211
- and that's the only other...
- You are a liar!

25:59.212 --> 26:00.669
- ...music that I have.
- He is a liar.

26:00.670 --> 26:03.169
Do you want a liar for a coach?
I'm truthful.

26:03.170 --> 26:05.759
Molly, I'm not gonna lie.
I think Kelly is a good fit for you.

26:05.784 --> 26:07.794
- Yeah? Yeah? Yeah?
- Thank you, Adam.

26:07.795 --> 26:11.002
I bet that's shocking to hear.

26:11.003 --> 26:13.669
- I will say, strategically on the show...
- Yeah?

26:13.670 --> 26:16.502
...your chances are higher with Kelly.

26:16.503 --> 26:20.002
But I like Blake, as well.

26:20.003 --> 26:23.086
No matter what they say,
it's fun to watch you perform

26:23.087 --> 26:24.902
because it just looks like you're just

26:24.926 --> 26:27.505
- sinking your teeth into this song.
- Absolutely.

26:27.545 --> 26:30.719
And I don't know if that was you
playing the arpeggio part on the...

26:30.744 --> 26:32.919
- Oh, Lord.
- ...on the acoustic, but I...

26:32.920 --> 26:35.086
He's so smart with his musical terms.

26:35.087 --> 26:37.044
He Googled that term
like five minutes ago.

26:37.045 --> 26:38.629
- You see what's happening here, Molly?
- I see that.

26:38.654 --> 26:40.187
It doesn't matter what I say.

26:42.003 --> 26:43.669
You're not confined to one thing.

26:43.670 --> 26:45.252
You don't sound like
every other country artist.

26:45.253 --> 26:46.877
I think that's why Chris Stapleton

26:46.878 --> 26:48.711
- sounds so great in this genre.
- Yeah.

26:48.712 --> 26:50.044
Kacey Musgraves is stepping out,

26:50.045 --> 26:52.919
doing something different,
and that is captivating.

26:52.920 --> 26:55.211
- Yes, Kelly.
- And that is why, ma'am,

26:55.212 --> 26:57.586
- you should be on my team.
- Yes!

26:59.087 --> 27:02.318
Hey, Molly, who do you pick
as your coach?

27:02.343 --> 27:04.627
Oh, man.

27:07.573 --> 27:09.160
- Who's she gonna pick?
- I say Blake.

27:09.185 --> 27:12.309
- Kelly.
- I think Blake.

27:12.753 --> 27:14.127
Come on, Molly!

27:23.253 --> 27:25.294
- I pick Kelly!
- Yeah!

27:25.295 --> 27:28.627
Yes!

27:28.628 --> 27:31.127
Yes!

27:31.128 --> 27:32.087
Yeah!

27:32.088 --> 27:33.752
Sorry, Blake.

27:33.753 --> 27:36.294
Yes! Oh, my gosh.

27:36.295 --> 27:38.044
I'm so excited about Molly.

27:38.045 --> 27:40.127
I think that we connect on the soulful,

27:40.128 --> 27:42.377
like, rock, like, country.
Like, I love all those things.

27:42.378 --> 27:44.961
- Yes!
- I can't help you now, Molly.

27:44.962 --> 27:47.086
I can't help you now.

27:47.087 --> 27:50.752
It's easy to see that the
other three coaches gang up on me.

27:50.753 --> 27:54.086
I mean, it takes three of them
to go against one of me.

27:54.087 --> 27:56.562
Hey! Hey!

27:56.587 --> 27:59.554
I have no one on my team yet today,

27:59.579 --> 28:01.689
and I'm starting to feel
a little bit left out.

28:07.462 --> 28:09.461
That was a team effort.

28:09.462 --> 28:13.169
Did that feel good?
'Cause it felt good here.

28:13.170 --> 28:15.169
- I got a joke. I got a joke.
- Okay, go.

28:15.170 --> 28:17.419
Knock, knock.

28:17.420 --> 28:19.086
- Who's there?
- Who's there?

28:19.087 --> 28:20.336

Boom!

28:22.462 --> 28:24.836
Good job.

28:24.837 --> 28:26.836
I think I got her on the last...
That was the last thing.

28:26.837 --> 28:28.336
- This is rigged. This is rigged.
- You are good.

28:28.337 --> 28:30.377
- This is rigged.
- It takes a village.

28:30.378 --> 28:33.598
- "It takes a village."
- It takes a village to take that home.

- Dylan, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

29:04.869 --> 29:07.627
- How long you been singing?
- I've been singing since I was 14,

29:07.628 --> 29:09.752
but I acted from when I was 3.

29:09.753 --> 29:11.693
I booked to the "Stepford Wives" remake

29:11.717 --> 29:12.938
- when I was six.
- Oh, nice.

29:12.963 --> 29:14.586
I was in a couple of
national commercials.

29:14.587 --> 29:16.419
- In "The Black Donnellys."
- Oh, I loved that show.

29:16.420 --> 29:17.752
Joey "Ice Cream."

29:17.753 --> 29:19.586
- You were Joey "Ice Cream"?
- As a youth.

29:19.587 --> 29:21.544
You will be Joey "Ice Cream"
to me around "The Voice" now.

29:21.545 --> 29:23.711
Dude, that's great, man.
I loved being Joey "Ice Cream."

29:23.712 --> 29:26.211
I never really learned
how to sing until I hit puberty.

29:26.212 --> 29:30.002
So, when I turned 16,
my mom found this boy band.

29:30.003 --> 29:32.086
I auditioned for it, and I got picked.

29:32.087 --> 29:36.502
The name of the group was NY5.
Super bubblegum pop.

29:36.503 --> 29:38.502
Put out a couple of songs on YouTube,

29:38.503 --> 29:39.919
played a couple of shows,

29:39.920 --> 29:41.586
but we ultimately broke up.

29:41.587 --> 29:43.752
At 19, I started my solo career.

29:43.753 --> 29:45.586
I spent two years in the city

29:45.587 --> 29:47.752
with the manager of the boy band.

29:47.753 --> 29:50.961
And it was funk/pop music, which
is really fun stuff to play,

29:50.962 --> 29:54.127
but it wasn't my stuff,
so I decided to move back home.

29:54.128 --> 29:58.127
Since I came home,
I've been able to root myself,

29:58.128 --> 30:00.044
going back to the things that I love,

30:00.045 --> 30:02.877
going to college,
playing acoustic guitar.

30:02.878 --> 30:04.877
My dad was like, "Let's just, like,

30:04.878 --> 30:06.877
build a studio in the basement."

30:06.878 --> 30:08.586
It took us three months

30:08.587 --> 30:10.919
building this place
and rebuilding myself.

30:10.920 --> 30:13.961
This studio is like my heart right now.

30:13.962 --> 30:15.919
It was very important for me to shift

30:15.920 --> 30:17.377
the genres that I was singing.

30:17.378 --> 30:19.252
My parents were so supportive.

30:19.253 --> 30:20.627
We sat down and listened to

30:20.628 --> 30:22.794
a lot of vinyl of a lot folk rock.

30:22.795 --> 30:24.752
So, the kind of music I do now

30:24.753 --> 30:28.127
is more about the lyrics
and the stories.

30:28.128 --> 30:31.127
I think if I had a coach
that is in the industry,

30:31.128 --> 30:34.127
they can help me
better everything that I do

30:34.128 --> 30:37.836

I'm 21, and I'm from
Wyckoff, New Jersey.

32:47.628 --> 32:49.544

32:49.545 --> 32:50.967
Oh, my gosh.

32:50.992 --> 32:52.165
Like, what's your style of music?

32:52.190 --> 32:54.332
- Is there something specific?
- Folk rock.

32:54.357 --> 32:56.935
- Yeah. That's cool.
- Yeah. Like, Loggins and Messina...

32:56.960 --> 32:59.483
- Yeah. Yeah, nice.
- ...Bob Dylan.

32:59.508 --> 33:01.699
I love it. I love it.

33:01.724 --> 33:05.032
- So, how did you start singing?
- I was an actor at first...

33:05.057 --> 33:06.675
- Oh.
- ...and then I picked it up

33:06.699 --> 33:09.294
when I hit puberty.

33:09.319 --> 33:10.770
That's a good time to pick it up.

33:10.795 --> 33:11.855
I hate puberty, man.

33:11.879 --> 33:13.094
- That's the worst, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

33:13.095 --> 33:15.386
You think you'll ever get past it?

33:15.387 --> 33:16.927
But, yo, man, you're great.

33:16.928 --> 33:18.927
I love that song. It's a classic.

33:18.928 --> 33:22.302
And that nostalgia can kind of cause
me some trouble with this button.

33:22.303 --> 33:24.136
But it doesn't matter
'cause you got Kelly Clarkson.

33:24.137 --> 33:25.469
- Yeah, baby.
- And she's awesome.

33:25.470 --> 33:27.386
- Yes!
- Congratulations, man.

33:27.387 --> 33:29.886
I don't know if you wanted me,
but you got me.

33:29.887 --> 33:31.927

- Come on!
- You're mine! Yes!

33:35.470 --> 33:37.302
I'm excited about Dylan in the sense

33:37.303 --> 33:38.927
that he is like a dark horse.

33:38.928 --> 33:40.532
- I can't wait, man. This is yours.
- I can't wait.

33:40.557 --> 33:41.618
It's probably not gonna fit,

33:41.643 --> 33:44.278
- but it's Team Clarkson.
- Yeah!

33:44.303 --> 33:45.469
I love the texture of his voice.

33:45.470 --> 33:47.136
I love that he loves folk rock.

33:47.137 --> 33:48.927
I think that he has
a lot more in his arsenal.

34:46.337 --> 34:49.043
I grew up in a little town
called Old Orcutt, California,

34:49.045 --> 34:50.918
and my family loves music,

34:50.920 --> 34:53.918
a lot of funk and soul, jazz and blues.

34:53.920 --> 34:55.502
And there's a saying that you
don't choose the blues,

34:55.503 --> 34:56.918
the blues chooses you.

34:56.920 --> 34:58.586
And that's something I firmly believe

34:58.587 --> 35:02.044
because you don't make any money
playing the blues whatsoever.

35:11.170 --> 35:14.544
In March 2010, I packed up 10 guitars,

35:14.545 --> 35:16.586
one suitcase, put it in my truck,

35:16.587 --> 35:18.377
put a tarp over it,

35:18.378 --> 35:20.820
Good afternoon. Tri-State.

35:20.845 --> 35:23.761
...but everybody has to work.

My name's Pryor Baird. I'm 35 years old.

38:12.792 --> 38:15.249
I'm from a little, bitty town
called Old Orcutt, California.

38:15.250 --> 38:17.082
Seven years ago, I sold everything I had

38:17.083 --> 38:19.707

- Well, thank you.
- I love all of it.

38:25.958 --> 38:27.916
Just the soulfulness... it's innate,

38:27.917 --> 38:29.303
but you're rocking out to it, as well.

38:29.304 --> 38:30.422

38:37.958 --> 38:40.416

and unique and amazing.

38:40.417 --> 38:43.207
That's a big compliment

38:43.208 --> 38:44.791
Thank you very much.

38:44.792 --> 38:47.291
I don't usually hear someone
sing the way you do

38:47.292 --> 38:49.082
and play the way you do.
That is a rarity.

38:49.083 --> 38:51.957

That's my heart and soul.

Hey, Pryor, speaking of
your guitar playing,

38:59.333 --> 39:00.957
I instantly thought,

39:00.958 --> 39:02.957
"That sounds like
Pete Anderson back there."

39:02.982 --> 39:04.956
He made all of Dwight Yoakam's

39:04.980 --> 39:06.000
- early records.
- Yes.

39:06.000 --> 39:08.124
'Cause it's a little bit wild,
it's a little bit loose,

39:08.125 --> 39:10.291
- it's in the moment, so...
- Whoo! Whoo!

39:10.292 --> 39:11.942
I can hear my dad
yelling in the background.

39:11.967 --> 39:14.300
Is that right?

39:14.792 --> 39:17.082
Dude, you are an incredible vocalist.

39:17.083 --> 39:19.363
It sounds like you smoked
a pack of cigarettes

39:19.387 --> 39:20.465
and drank a bottle of whiskey

39:20.490 --> 39:23.166
- right before you got onstage, man.
- It's not true, Mom. It's not true.

39:23.167 --> 39:24.999
It's not true.

39:25.000 --> 39:26.957
Those days are long gone, long gone.

39:26.958 --> 39:28.457
Thanks a lot.

39:28.482 --> 39:31.166
I did that stuff for years in
order to try to sound like you,

39:31.167 --> 39:32.306
and I still didn't get there.

39:32.330 --> 39:33.495
- You just have that...
- Why would you want to be led down

39:33.520 --> 39:35.207
the path of addiction right now?

39:36.833 --> 39:38.926
You were born with that weathered sound.

39:38.951 --> 39:40.109
That's what makes you rare.

39:40.133 --> 39:42.133
That's what separates you
from the rest of the pack.

39:42.208 --> 39:44.166
That's why you got to pick me
as your coach, man.

39:44.167 --> 39:48.291
I need you on my team!
I want you on my team, Pryor!

39:48.292 --> 39:50.499
- I want you!
- This is gonna take a minute.

39:50.500 --> 39:53.291

39:56.575 --> 39:58.345

39:58.370 --> 39:59.624

- Yeah. See?

39:59.625 --> 40:01.541
- It's nice, isn't it?
- It's nice.

40:01.542 --> 40:03.332
It takes a lot to just sit here

40:03.333 --> 40:06.243
and take all this fighting over you.

40:06.268 --> 40:08.874
Listening to you, I felt like
there's such a power,

40:08.875 --> 40:12.041
and you have such a range.
It felt so good.

40:12.042 --> 40:15.082

you to continue to explore.

40:15.083 --> 40:16.666
I'd love to bring you
to that next space,

40:16.667 --> 40:20.541
and I definitely feel
I'm the only one that can sing

40:20.542 --> 40:23.041
somewhere in the vicinity
that you just sang,

40:23.042 --> 40:24.476
so that we can actually have...

40:24.500 --> 40:26.041
- Oh, Kelly.
- similar spaces...

40:26.042 --> 40:28.332
...to create from.

40:28.333 --> 40:29.809
I got a high voice for a dude, you know.

40:29.833 --> 40:30.936
You got a high voice for a dude,

40:30.961 --> 40:34.332
but not all that gravel.

40:34.333 --> 40:36.207
Look, I have to be your coach.

40:36.208 --> 40:38.582
The fact that that thing
that you're holding onto still

40:38.583 --> 40:40.749
is a part of you and
an extension of who you are...

40:40.750 --> 40:42.332
I understand that.

40:42.333 --> 40:45.374
Okay, so, Pryor,
you've heard us all talk.

40:45.375 --> 40:46.993
Who do you pick as your coach?

40:48.050 --> 40:50.541
- Come on, man.
- Come on!

40:50.542 --> 40:52.374
Whoo!

40:55.250 --> 40:57.291
I promise you I'm gonna do
the best I can for you.

40:57.292 --> 41:00.416
I promise.

41:00.417 --> 41:02.291
- Who you gonna pick?
- Boy, this is tough.

41:02.292 --> 41:04.082
- No, please, it's not...
- Please, Pryor!

41:04.083 --> 41:07.249
- It shouldn't be tough.
- You should go for the girls.

41:10.458 --> 41:13.457
- I'm gonna pick Blake.
- Yes! Yes!

41:14.750 --> 41:17.249
- Yeah!
- Wow!

41:17.250 --> 41:19.124
Yeah!

41:19.125 --> 41:22.124
♪ Playin' in a travelin' band ♪

41:22.125 --> 41:23.291
♪ Yeah ♪

41:23.292 --> 41:26.082
That was pretty good.

41:26.083 --> 41:27.624
Pryor is an amazing talent.

41:27.625 --> 41:29.707
I think I just had
enough kinship with him,

41:29.708 --> 41:32.624
he just felt some sort of a bond
with me, and thank God.

41:32.625 --> 41:35.124
Pryor's a threat to everybody
in this competition.

41:35.125 --> 41:37.457
- All good, man. It's all good, man.
- Sorry.

41:37.458 --> 41:39.291
No, you're in good hands with him.

41:39.292 --> 41:41.624
Ugh. That one hurt.

41:41.625 --> 41:43.678
Pryor hurt. I should have had him.

41:43.703 --> 41:46.291
At least you got somebody.

41:46.292 --> 41:48.582
Ohh!

41:48.583 --> 41:51.332
You want that guy?
ou want that guy to coach you?

41:51.333 --> 41:52.916
Working with Blake
is gonna be a lot of fun.

41:52.917 --> 41:56.457
- Look! Look at this!
- He and I have kindred spirits.

41:56.458 --> 41:58.916
He's a simple, down-home, regular guy,

41:58.917 --> 42:00.499
and I think he'll really focus on

42:00.500 --> 42:02.291
what I want my music to sound like.

42:02.599 --> 42:04.764
Whoo!

42:04.789 --> 42:09.789
