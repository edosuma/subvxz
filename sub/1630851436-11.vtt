- Kids, I've graded
your mid-term exams.

00:51.017 --> 00:53.620
Some of you
performed atrociously,

00:53.720 --> 00:56.189
while others
stepped up quite well.

00:56.256 --> 00:57.791
- B-minus?

00:57.891 --> 01:00.026
- Oh, don't be mad, Tom,
it was a hard test.

01:00.093 --> 01:01.361
- Mad? I'm ecstatic.

01:01.428 --> 01:02.762
I've never gotten
a B-minus in my life!

01:02.862 --> 01:04.464
- Oh, well.
Congratulations, then.

01:04.564 --> 01:06.466
- Oh, my God, I'm gonna dance.
I can't control myself.

01:06.566 --> 01:08.234
- My man!
I knew you could do it, baby!

01:08.301 --> 01:10.303
- I've never been this happy
in my life. I got a B-minus!

01:10.403 --> 01:11.971
<i>- Attention, students.</i>

01:12.072 --> 01:14.207
<i>I'm sorry to interrupt,
but this is very urgent.</i>

01:14.274 --> 01:16.242
<i>Tom, I need to see you now.</i>

01:16.309 --> 01:18.578
- Kind of puts a damper
on the B-minus dance.

01:18.645 --> 01:20.480
<i>- Get up right now
and go, go, go, go.</i>

01:20.580 --> 01:22.415
<i>Run towards my office!</i>

01:25.819 --> 01:27.253
- Hey, Principal,
I ran down the hall.

01:27.320 --> 01:29.389
What's going on?
- Tom, it's about your mother.

01:29.456 --> 01:30.623
- My mom? What do you mean?
Is she okay?

01:30.723 --> 01:31.991
- Are you kidding me?

01:32.092 --> 01:33.893
She's better than okay.
She's on fire.

01:33.960 --> 01:35.995
- Wait. I'm not following.
What?

01:36.096 --> 01:38.164
- I'm attracted to your mom,
and I've been watching her

01:38.264 --> 01:40.767
for years at PTA meetings,
at bake sales.

01:40.834 --> 01:42.302
I saw her come out
of the supermarket;

01:42.402 --> 01:44.170
I sat in my car, I got aroused.

01:44.270 --> 01:46.506
- I'm not sure this was
an urgent matter.

01:46.606 --> 01:49.008
- Well, it's urgent for me.
I need a favor.

01:49.109 --> 01:50.677
- Okay.
- When you get home, I want you

01:50.777 --> 01:53.813
to try to casually weave
my name into the conversation.

01:53.913 --> 01:56.015
- Just casually weave it in?
- Casually. Something like,

01:56.116 --> 01:58.184
I don't know, "The principal's
got a great personality.

01:58.284 --> 01:59.752
Hey, ever notice his tush,
Mom?"

01:59.819 --> 02:01.421
- That's not gonna
sound natural.

02:01.488 --> 02:02.989
When I get home, I usually
just say, "When's dinner?"

02:03.089 --> 02:04.424
- Tom, you owe me.
- Do I?

02:04.491 --> 02:05.959
- How do you think
you got a B-minus?

02:06.025 --> 02:07.760
- Hard work?
- I pulled strings, okay?

02:07.827 --> 02:09.362
- Wait, you're saying
it's a fake grade?

02:09.462 --> 02:11.030
- Yeah.
- Oh, this is really going to

02:11.131 --> 02:12.332
a dark place here.

02:12.432 --> 02:13.666
- Not if you know how
the world works,

02:13.766 --> 02:14.801
it's not dark, Tom.

02:14.868 --> 02:16.436
But the most important thing is

02:16.503 --> 02:18.037
please keep this between us.

02:18.138 --> 02:19.839
- Why?
- Well, the school frowns

02:19.939 --> 02:23.476
upon--they almost over-frown
upon principals

02:23.543 --> 02:25.011
hitting on moms.

02:25.111 --> 02:27.847
- My son got a B-minus?
- Yeah, it's no big deal.

02:27.947 --> 02:29.215
- This is amazing!

02:29.315 --> 02:30.517
- Yeah, enough
about me, though.

02:30.617 --> 02:31.985
- I couldn't be more proud.

02:32.051 --> 02:33.653
- Uh, anyway,
on an unrelated note,

02:33.720 --> 02:36.189
I just overheard some of
the moms talking at school.

02:36.289 --> 02:38.625
They really seem to think
the principal is hot.

02:38.691 --> 02:40.059
- Excuse me?
- The principal.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.394
They seem to think he's got--

02:41.494 --> 02:43.563
uh, what was the phrase?
Cute buns or a--

02:43.663 --> 02:45.064
- Cute buns?
- Hot tush.

02:45.165 --> 02:46.733
- So a lot of butt talk
about the principal.

02:46.833 --> 02:48.468
- It was a lot
of different stuff.

02:48.535 --> 02:51.237
They got into the personality,
the fun sense of humor.

02:51.337 --> 02:52.672
- Mm-kay.
- I don't know why

02:52.739 --> 02:54.340
I focused on the--on
the butt comments,

02:54.407 --> 02:56.075
but it was a lot
of positive talk, is all.

02:56.176 --> 02:59.078
- Did the principal tell you
to talk to me about his body?

02:59.179 --> 03:00.747
- You know what?
I think the guy likes you,

03:00.847 --> 03:02.715
so do--do what
you will with it.

03:02.815 --> 03:04.017
- He likes me?

03:04.083 --> 03:06.586
Wow, this day
keeps getting better.

03:06.686 --> 03:08.821
- Oh, it's a good thing?
- Guess what.

03:08.888 --> 03:10.156
The guy's a principal

03:10.223 --> 03:11.424
of a school.
- Okay.

03:11.524 --> 03:13.059
- This guy can declare
snow days.

03:13.159 --> 03:14.694
He can order textbooks in bulk.

03:14.761 --> 03:16.763
He can have bike racks
installed wherever he wants.

03:16.863 --> 03:18.498
- I don't know if that's
considered powerful.

03:18.565 --> 03:20.833
- If I can upgrade
from plumber to principal,

03:20.900 --> 03:22.602
we're back in business.
- Really?

03:22.702 --> 03:24.370
- You tell him I'm in.
- All right. Great.

03:24.437 --> 03:26.906
- Even if it gets weird.
Even if he's into some kink.

03:27.006 --> 03:29.876
Like, whatever kind of date
he wants to go on, I'm in.

03:29.943 --> 03:31.411
- I'll just say you're in.

03:33.213 --> 03:34.614
- Excuse me.
When you get a chance,

03:34.714 --> 03:36.115
could we get some, uh,

03:36.216 --> 03:39.252
water from the sink,
and is all the bread free?

03:39.352 --> 03:40.954
- Uh, yes, sir.
All the bread is free.

03:42.355 --> 03:43.856
- And I know
you brought us butter.

03:43.923 --> 03:45.792
If I asked for extra butter,
is that free, too?

03:45.892 --> 03:48.361
- Yeah, that's free also, sir.

03:48.428 --> 03:50.096
- Okay, thank you very much.

03:50.196 --> 03:51.931
- Okay.

03:52.031 --> 03:53.967
He's being silly
and hilarious.

03:54.067 --> 03:55.468
We're gonna take
the seafood tower

03:55.568 --> 03:57.370
and your classiest wine,

03:57.437 --> 03:59.806
'cause I am on a date
with a principal.

03:59.906 --> 04:02.208
- What do you think
principals make?

04:02.275 --> 04:04.644
- Well, more than my jackass
husband used to make.

04:04.744 --> 04:06.479
Let's get some photos,
make him jealous,

04:06.579 --> 04:08.715
show him how good I'm doing.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

04:08.781 --> 04:10.283
If this gets out,
I will lose my job.

04:10.383 --> 04:12.819
- No one's gonna see it.
Hey, waiter! Come over.

04:12.919 --> 04:14.654
You're gonna get
some pictures of us. Okay?

04:14.754 --> 04:16.322
- Okay.
- I'm gonna lay on the table.

04:16.422 --> 04:19.492
He's gonna undo his shirt,
and I'm gonna put lobster

04:19.592 --> 04:22.161
on his bare skin
and eat it off of his skin.

04:22.262 --> 04:24.163
- I don't like to do that.
- Oh, okay.

04:24.264 --> 04:25.465
- Oh, geez.
- Okay!

04:25.565 --> 04:26.933
- Oh, that's inappropriate.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.303
- Okay, baby bird some lobster
into my mouth.

04:30.403 --> 04:31.838
- Okay.

04:35.008 --> 04:37.777
- What have I done?
Oh, this is not good.

04:37.844 --> 04:39.912
- Principal? Is that you?
- Oh, Tom!

04:39.979 --> 04:41.781
Oh, my God.
It's so funny seeing you here.

04:41.848 --> 04:43.249
- It's my house.
This is my kitchen.

04:43.316 --> 04:44.651
- Yeah, I just didn't expect
to see ya--

04:44.751 --> 04:46.085
- Why are you here?
- I stopped by

04:46.152 --> 04:47.620
to go over your grades
with your mother.

04:47.687 --> 04:49.956
- Is that my dad's shirt?
- Oh, that?

04:50.023 --> 04:51.924
I spilled coffee
on my shirt this morning.

04:51.991 --> 04:53.192
And I--

04:53.293 --> 04:54.861
Tom, I'm gonna--I'm gonna
level with you.

04:54.961 --> 04:56.296
I didn't think this thing

04:56.362 --> 04:58.031
with your mom
was gonna escalate so fast.

04:58.131 --> 04:59.465
- Okay.
- I mean, your mom's

04:59.532 --> 05:01.367
a wonderful woman,
but she's a maniac.

05:01.467 --> 05:02.669
- That's a lot to take in.

05:02.769 --> 05:05.805
- Tom... I'm schtupping
your mother.

05:05.872 --> 05:08.041
- Schtup? What is that?
- We-we you know.

05:08.141 --> 05:09.475
Flippity flip, floppity flop.

05:09.542 --> 05:11.177
Look, I don't know
how to say it in--in a--

05:11.277 --> 05:13.012
- Does it have to do with
pancakes or what are you--?

05:13.112 --> 05:15.348
- Tom, the important thing is
that no can know about this.

05:15.448 --> 05:17.383
If this word gets out,
I'm done.

05:17.483 --> 05:19.218
- All right, so what do you
want me to do?

05:19.319 --> 05:21.287
- Promise me you'll keep it
our secret and I will give you

05:21.354 --> 05:23.456
anything you want at school.
You name it.

05:23.523 --> 05:24.891
- Anything?
- Anything.

05:24.991 --> 05:26.159
- Literally anything?

05:26.225 --> 05:27.660
- Literally anything.

05:27.727 --> 05:28.995
- Just anything,
anything I want?

05:29.062 --> 05:30.063
- Just say it.

05:30.163 --> 05:31.531
- How about, uh, free pencils

05:31.631 --> 05:33.666
and some kind of, uh, pouch
to keep them in?

05:33.733 --> 05:35.068
- Done.
- Really?

05:35.168 --> 05:36.369
- Yes.
- That's amazing.

05:36.469 --> 05:38.371
- Aw, look at my two guys.

05:38.471 --> 05:39.839
Tom, get on his lap.

05:39.906 --> 05:41.307
Principal, you feed him
some pancakes.

05:41.374 --> 05:42.575
We-we need to stick it

05:42.675 --> 05:44.544
to my ex-husband
and to Tina the slut.

05:44.644 --> 05:46.145
- This doesn't feel right
at all.

05:46.212 --> 05:47.513
- Let's just get it over with.

05:48.981 --> 05:50.750
- Free pencils?
- How sweet is that?

05:50.850 --> 05:52.385
- Man, this guy is throwing rod
in your mom

05:52.485 --> 05:54.187
and all you asked
for was free pencils?

05:54.253 --> 05:56.723
- All I asked for? I'm never
going to need a pencil again.

05:56.823 --> 05:58.691
- Come on, man!
You need to think big.

05:58.758 --> 06:00.993
With a secret like that,
you could ask for anything.

06:01.060 --> 06:02.762
- All right. I mean,
I guess we could try

06:02.862 --> 06:04.397
escalating this a bit.
- Nelson's right.

06:04.497 --> 06:05.932
- Oh, boy. Here we go.

06:06.032 --> 06:07.667
- With blackmail,
you basically own the person.

06:07.734 --> 06:09.335
- Own them?
- In grown-up terms, Tom,

06:09.402 --> 06:10.837
you could say
he's your bitch now.

06:10.903 --> 06:12.038
- Please don't curse
on the bus.

06:12.105 --> 06:13.272
- Guys, how do you think I got

06:13.373 --> 06:14.540
this sweet bus driving gig?

06:14.607 --> 06:16.609
- You didn't just apply?
- Blackmail.

06:16.709 --> 06:18.277
- Oh.
- Got nude pics

06:18.378 --> 06:20.079
of the bus dispatch guy.
- Henry?

06:20.179 --> 06:22.048
- That's how I have
job security.

06:22.115 --> 06:23.349
I can do whatever I want.

06:23.416 --> 06:24.951
- I'm tempted to say,
can we see them?

06:25.051 --> 06:26.519
- He's sucking his own
dick, guys.

06:26.586 --> 06:27.954
- Oh! Hey, hey, hey! Whoa.
- Whoa.

06:28.054 --> 06:29.622
Wow.
- We've got to start sitting

06:29.722 --> 06:31.023
further back on the bus.

06:32.392 --> 06:34.460
- Hey there, big boss man.

06:34.560 --> 06:36.129
- Oh, wow. Is this peppermint?

06:36.229 --> 06:37.797
Don't mind if I do.

06:38.798 --> 06:40.733
- All right. First of all,
put the peppermints down!

06:40.800 --> 06:42.702
And you guys don't just come
running in here like that.

06:42.769 --> 06:44.237
Do you even
have an appointment?

06:44.303 --> 06:46.139
- Appointment?
- We're not appointment guys.

06:46.239 --> 06:47.473
- Listen, I know what's what.

06:47.573 --> 06:49.809
Tom told me you's banging
his mom

06:49.909 --> 06:51.310
and you offered him pencils.

06:51.411 --> 06:53.813
You offered my man pencils?
- Are you joking?

06:53.913 --> 06:55.148
- Sorry, I crack
under pressure.

06:55.248 --> 06:56.883
I told him.
- This is outrageous.

06:56.949 --> 06:58.418
- We would like to leverage
this to our advantage.

06:58.484 --> 06:59.919
- Yeah, we want to, um, do

06:59.986 --> 07:01.387
a little blackmail type thing.

07:01.454 --> 07:02.989
- We've got a list of demands.

07:03.089 --> 07:04.791
- This is ridiculous!

07:04.891 --> 07:07.593
A VIP card that gets you
out of trouble?

07:07.660 --> 07:09.462
- Laminated.
- Two recesses per day?

07:09.562 --> 07:12.165
Great. And I have to read
an anti-Hector announcement,

07:12.265 --> 07:13.566
oh, that you guys write?

07:13.633 --> 07:15.835
- That's it.
- Come on, I can't do this.

07:15.935 --> 07:19.005
- Who's the principal now,
bitch?

07:19.105 --> 07:20.406
- Wow.
- All right, all right.

07:20.473 --> 07:22.141
That's too much.
I know we have power now,

07:22.241 --> 07:23.810
but that was crossing the line.

07:26.112 --> 07:28.915
- Um, may I ask why you two
aren't in class?

07:28.981 --> 07:31.984
- You may not.
Talk to the VIP note.

07:32.084 --> 07:33.453
- Oh, my God.

07:33.519 --> 07:34.854
<i>- All right, guys.</i>

07:34.954 --> 07:36.088
<i>I have an announcement</i>

07:36.155 --> 07:37.690
<i>that I have to read to you.</i>

07:37.790 --> 07:39.358
<i>Hector is stupid.</i>
- What?

07:39.459 --> 07:40.793
- Thank you.
I'm telling you

07:40.860 --> 07:42.295
because if I don't,
nobody else will.

07:42.361 --> 07:44.297
- Come on, wrap it up.

07:44.363 --> 07:45.598
Recess is over.

07:45.665 --> 07:47.033
- Actually,
we're gonna double dip.

07:47.133 --> 07:48.701
- Double dip?
- Double decker recess,

07:48.801 --> 07:50.203
whatever you want to call it.

07:50.303 --> 07:52.205
You have a problem,
talk to the principal.

07:52.305 --> 07:54.707
- ♪ Let's get it on now ♪

07:54.807 --> 07:57.443
- Oh, we are living.
I'm having a great time.

07:57.510 --> 07:59.045
- Wow, I'm having
a good time too.

07:59.145 --> 08:01.514
I mean, but, uh, just, uh,
if you could just ease up

08:01.614 --> 08:04.183
on the churros
because they're $10 each.

08:04.283 --> 08:06.285
- Why would you care about
$10 each?

08:06.352 --> 08:08.287
You're a prina-ci-pal-a.

08:08.354 --> 08:10.389
- Do you mind if I ask
how many you bought?

08:10.490 --> 08:11.791
- 30.
- Oh, my! 30?

08:11.858 --> 08:13.626
Are you kidding me?
That's $300.

08:13.693 --> 08:15.328
- Yeah.
- What are you doing with them?

08:15.394 --> 08:17.897
- A couple I ate, but mostly
I'm just throwing them.

08:17.997 --> 08:19.198
- Hey, knock it off!

08:19.298 --> 08:21.667
- So 2 you ate and 28
you're throwing!?

08:21.734 --> 08:24.570
- I mean, some ratio
akin to that, yeah.

08:24.670 --> 08:25.905
- Oh, my God.
-

08:26.005 --> 08:27.139
- Give me my credit card.
Seriously.

08:27.206 --> 08:28.407
- Come and get it.

08:28.508 --> 08:29.876
- I don't want to come
and get it.

08:29.976 --> 08:31.143
- Hey, you.

08:31.210 --> 08:33.179
- Stop throwing the churros,
lady!

08:33.880 --> 08:37.149
- Oh, Nelson.
I like this VIP lifestyle.

08:37.216 --> 08:39.552
- The sun is shining on us.
- Taking a long lunch

08:39.652 --> 08:42.054
while the rest of the chumps
are in the cafeteria.

08:42.154 --> 08:43.756
- This whole mom banging
episode

08:43.856 --> 08:45.258
really worked out in our favor.

08:45.358 --> 08:46.425
- Oh, no.
- What? What?

08:46.526 --> 08:49.495
- What's this? Dakota's mom?

08:49.562 --> 08:50.997
- How many moms
is this guy banging?

08:51.063 --> 08:52.431
- All right,
we gotta stop this.

08:52.532 --> 08:53.933
- We gotta do something.

08:54.033 --> 08:56.035
If he break up with your mom,
our privileges are done.

08:56.102 --> 08:58.371
- This has to end now.
What do we do? Google it.

08:58.437 --> 09:00.940
"How to stop principal
from banging moms."

09:01.040 --> 09:03.209
- "Stop principals
from banging moms."

09:03.276 --> 09:06.279
- "Principal banging
multiple women."

09:06.379 --> 09:08.447
- "Principal banging--" Ugh!

09:08.548 --> 09:10.283
- Nothing comes up?
- We got 18 results.

09:10.383 --> 09:11.784
Only two of them in English.

09:11.884 --> 09:13.519
- Oh, man.
Let's get out of here.

09:13.586 --> 09:14.787
All right. What's the plan?

09:14.887 --> 09:16.022
- We're gonna hack
his computer.

09:16.088 --> 09:17.523
- How are we gonna do that?

09:17.590 --> 09:19.125
- Look, we just need to guess
his password,

09:19.225 --> 09:21.127
then write a break-up email
to Dakota's mom.

09:21.227 --> 09:22.628
- Oh, I love that.
- What do you think

09:22.728 --> 09:24.263
a guy like him
would use for a password?

09:24.363 --> 09:26.699
- I don't know, "principal"
or, uh, "the principal"?

09:26.766 --> 09:29.135
- "The principal." Nope.

09:29.235 --> 09:31.904
- Try "a principal."
- "A principal." Nope.

09:31.971 --> 09:36.309
- Try "I'm the principal."
- "I'm the principal." Nope.

09:36.409 --> 09:37.910
- Hey, guys!

09:37.977 --> 09:39.145
Need some help
with your homework?

09:39.245 --> 09:40.479
- No. We're trying to hack

09:40.580 --> 09:41.948
a grown man's email.

09:42.048 --> 09:44.417
What kind of passwords
do grown men use?

09:44.483 --> 09:47.720
- Try every variation of the
word penis, followed by 69.

09:47.787 --> 09:49.388
- How many variations of penis
are there?

09:49.455 --> 09:51.490
- Oh, there's a lot.
Are you ready?

09:51.591 --> 09:53.326
- Dong69.
- "Dong69". Nope.

09:53.426 --> 09:55.227
- Rod69.
- "Rod69." Nope.

09:55.294 --> 09:57.763
- Wiener69.
- "Wiener..." Nope.

09:57.830 --> 10:00.132
- Johnson69.
- "Johnson..." Nope.

10:00.232 --> 10:03.402
- How about Boner69?
- "Boner69." That's it!

10:03.469 --> 10:05.004
- All right, we're in!
- Thanks, Dad.

10:05.104 --> 10:09.175
- I'm glad I could help.
- Screw unlimited pencils.

10:09.275 --> 10:11.677
We're getting unlimited
everything.

10:11.777 --> 10:13.679
Now we just need to craft
a carefully worded email.

10:13.779 --> 10:15.147
- All right, let me write it.

10:15.247 --> 10:16.849
I'm pretty smart,
with the B-minus and all that.

10:16.949 --> 10:18.484
- Oh, no. No, Tom.

10:18.584 --> 10:20.653
This is my territory.
I know how adults talk.

10:20.753 --> 10:22.254
You see how I just
talked to that adult?

10:22.321 --> 10:23.422
- All right, you write it.

10:23.489 --> 10:24.657
I'll chime in.
- Let's go.

10:24.757 --> 10:26.359
"Dear Dakota's mom."
- Nice.

10:26.459 --> 10:29.595
- "Pursuant to
my prior obligations"--

10:29.662 --> 10:32.698
- Pursuant. I love that.
- "As per our meeting..."

10:32.798 --> 10:35.001
- It sounds like a principal
wrote that. It's amazing.

10:35.101 --> 10:36.869
- Come on, everybody!

10:36.969 --> 10:37.970
- Hey, Coach?

10:38.037 --> 10:39.205
I know you got gym class
going on

10:39.305 --> 10:40.773
but can you clear
the floor for us?

10:40.840 --> 10:42.675
- What are you saying?
- Tom and I have chosen

10:42.775 --> 10:44.543
to play a game of one-on-one
today.

10:44.644 --> 10:45.978
- Uh, this is a gym class.

10:46.045 --> 10:47.880
I can't clear the floor
for two kids.

10:47.980 --> 10:49.382
- Oh, he don't know?
- Yeah, he doesn't know.

10:49.482 --> 10:51.183
- Oh, you don't know?
- Talk to the card.

10:51.283 --> 10:52.852
- What is this?

10:52.952 --> 10:56.055
He's giving special treatment
to some kids and not others?

10:56.155 --> 10:58.057
- Hey, I mean, this is the way
the world works, I was told.

10:58.157 --> 10:59.959
- This is what Martin Luther
King marched about.

11:00.026 --> 11:01.894
- Speaking of marches, Coach,
get the marching band together.

11:01.994 --> 11:03.729
We're about to play
full court one-on-one.

11:03.829 --> 11:05.331
- Full court?
- Let me get your whistle.

11:05.398 --> 11:07.199
- Oh, no, no, no, no. You don't
touch my whistle.

11:07.299 --> 11:08.968
- Coach, I hate to pull rank.
- Tom, my whistle will not go

11:09.035 --> 11:10.469
in another man's mouth.
- Give me that whistle.

11:10.536 --> 11:12.038
- No. You're not--
What? No. No.

11:12.138 --> 11:13.406
- Hey, this is the game
of the century, Coach.

11:13.506 --> 11:14.573
You don't want to miss this.

11:16.642 --> 11:19.245
- No, I can't just leave school
to rent mopeds

11:19.345 --> 11:21.147
and just cruise around all day.

11:21.213 --> 11:22.481
- Lady, you cannot go in there.

11:22.548 --> 11:23.883
- Hold on. I'll call you
right back.

11:23.983 --> 11:25.818
- No! I said you can't!
- Yes, I am.

11:25.885 --> 11:27.920
- Don't make me
forcibly restrain you.

11:28.020 --> 11:31.924
- Don't touch me like that!
Gah! Oh, she's biting me!

11:32.024 --> 11:34.694
Oh, look who it is.
Principal Dickwad.

11:34.760 --> 11:36.862
What is this email
that you sent?

11:36.929 --> 11:38.564
- I sent an email?
- Don't play dumb,

11:38.664 --> 11:40.533
'cause guess what?
I was smart and I printed it.

11:40.599 --> 11:42.601
I meet with you
to discuss a bake sale,

11:42.702 --> 11:44.870
and then you write back
saying you can't bang me

11:44.937 --> 11:46.772
since you're already
banging Tom's mom?

11:46.872 --> 11:48.107
What is that?

11:48.207 --> 11:49.842
- I didn't write anything.
What are you--

11:49.909 --> 11:51.711
- Dating a student's parent
is strictly off limits.

11:51.777 --> 11:52.778
It's taboo!

11:52.878 --> 11:54.280
- No, I--
- I swear to God,

11:54.380 --> 11:57.116
you better fix this
and you better fix it now.

11:57.216 --> 11:58.951
- You know what?
I'm calling it off,

11:59.051 --> 12:01.120
because she's a handful anyway.
Thank you for swinging by,

12:01.220 --> 12:03.055
because you're doing me
a favor.

12:03.122 --> 12:05.524
- Hey, look who it is.
- I have to break it off.

12:05.591 --> 12:08.127
- Oh, yes, I agree.
This is great.

12:08.227 --> 12:09.795
- You're not upset at all?

12:09.895 --> 12:11.797
- I found out what grade school
principals make.

12:11.897 --> 12:13.966
Heh, you make less than
an average plumber.

12:14.066 --> 12:15.468
- Okay, I'm not dirt poor,
but--

12:15.568 --> 12:17.703
- I mean, you're pretty poor.
See ya!

12:17.770 --> 12:19.105
- Okay.

12:21.073 --> 12:22.475
- All right, me and Nelson
are gonna play

12:22.575 --> 12:24.577
a little one-on-one
while you guys watch.

12:24.643 --> 12:26.245
- Hector gonna do
the play-by-play.

12:26.312 --> 12:27.646
- That's just the way
it's gonna be.

12:27.747 --> 12:29.081
- Ah! Percussion!
Start right now.

12:29.148 --> 12:30.816
Can I get a low
tat-tat-tat-tat?

12:31.951 --> 12:33.219
- We've really come a long way

12:33.285 --> 12:34.820
from the pencil request,
I've got to say.

12:34.920 --> 12:37.123
- We're two kings right now
about to make history.

12:37.223 --> 12:38.991
- Here we go!

12:40.059 --> 12:41.327
- What a match up.

12:41.427 --> 12:44.964
Two legends in basketball
going head to head,

12:45.064 --> 12:49.902
where us losers get to watch
the best game of their lives?

12:49.969 --> 12:50.903
What?

12:50.970 --> 12:52.605
<i>- Attention, everybody.</i>

12:52.671 --> 12:54.273

special treatment,</i>

13:02.515 --> 13:06.085
<i>please tell them to shut up.
Have a nice day.</i>

13:06.952 --> 13:08.921
- All right, let's play!

13:10.956 --> 13:12.691
- Well, fun while it lasted,
I guess.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.360
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
What happens now?

13:14.460 --> 13:17.129
- Just be regular
ten-year-old kids, I guess.

13:17.196 --> 13:20.199
- Aw, man.
We're falling on hard times.

13:20.299 --> 13:22.268
