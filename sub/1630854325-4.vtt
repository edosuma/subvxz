00:12.971 --> 00:15.015
<i>The men who robbed the bank wore masks.</i>

00:15.599 --> 00:17.434
No one in the bank saw their faces.

00:18.227 --> 00:21.355
Far as the victim,
the gun that shot him was never found.

00:21.355 --> 00:23.232
No residue on you or your clothes.

00:24.024 --> 00:26.485
Despite giving you a right bloody kicking,

00:26.485 --> 00:29.363
the officers that arrested you
could attest to nothing

00:29.363 --> 00:33.116
but that you were giving the victim CPR
at the time.

00:34.493 --> 00:35.994
They can't put you in the bank.

00:36.578 --> 00:38.413
They can't put you with the gun.

00:38.497 --> 00:40.666
They can't even put you with the money.

00:40.666 --> 00:42.042
What was his name?

00:44.586 --> 00:45.587
The cop.

00:47.631 --> 00:49.633
Constantine Floris.

00:53.011 --> 00:54.179
Sounds Greek.

00:56.390 --> 00:58.684
Connie? Con.

00:59.560 --> 01:01.937
Or Gus. Sometimes they use Gus.

01:05.022 --> 01:06.483
I should write his wife a letter.

01:06.567 --> 01:07.734
Are you mental, Dale?

01:07.818 --> 01:09.528
They told me you're off the heroin.

01:09.528 --> 01:10.737
I'm clean.

01:11.947 --> 01:14.825
First time in a long time
I can see everything straight.

01:14.825 --> 01:16.451
Then see your way through this.

01:16.535 --> 01:20.080
Why would an innocent man
write the victim's wife a letter?

01:20.080 --> 01:21.623
One of the things we've got going for us

01:21.707 --> 01:23.625
is that you haven't
put anything in writing.

01:24.626 --> 01:26.044
A man was killed.

01:29.339 --> 01:33.218
Am I supposed to just act
like that never happened?

01:34.595 --> 01:35.637
Listen, Son.

01:36.430 --> 01:38.515
You sound like you're in a bit of a state.

01:38.599 --> 01:40.100
You've made some mistakes.

01:40.184 --> 01:42.769
It's to your credit you feel bad

01:42.853 --> 01:45.355
about whatever those alleged mistakes
might have been.

01:45.439 --> 01:47.065
How much is my mum paying you?

01:47.149 --> 01:49.151
Exactly what I'm worth.

01:49.902 --> 01:53.238
Help me help you
not balls the rest of your life up, Son.

01:53.947 --> 01:56.200
That's what your mum has paid me for.

02:02.247 --> 02:05.083
In the matter of the <i>State v. Conti</i>,

02:05.167 --> 02:07.878
Mr. Conti, how do you plead?

02:40.661 --> 02:41.703
Guilty.

02:44.039 --> 02:45.040
I'm guilty.

04:07.456 --> 04:11.460
<i>A man can live in a city
with a broken heart and mangled pride.</i>

04:12.336 --> 04:16.423
<i>But to survive in a slum,
he must unfurl it for all to see.</i>

04:17.507 --> 04:21.261
<i>And if I did that here,
maybe I'd get a second chance,</i>

04:22.053 --> 04:23.931
<i>a reckoning with my fate,</i>

04:24.723 --> 04:26.058
<i>but I didn't know that then.</i>

04:26.683 --> 04:28.977
<i>I treated it
like another sentence to be served,</i>

04:29.645 --> 04:31.146
<i>and in my ignorance,</i>

04:31.230 --> 04:34.942
<i>I decided it was my job to fix
a thing that they didn't see as broken.</i>

04:48.956 --> 04:51.041
<i>Assalamu alaikum</i>, Mr. Lin.

04:52.709 --> 04:55.045
I see we're keeping you busy, huh?

04:55.045 --> 04:57.506
I'm doing what I can. Trying, anyway.

04:57.506 --> 05:00.968
No one expects any more from you.
We are lucky to have you with us.

05:08.433 --> 05:09.643
Sonam.

06:01.486 --> 06:03.864
What on earth are you doing?
-Minister Pandey.

06:03.864 --> 06:05.032
Deputy Minister.

06:05.032 --> 06:07.868
Not for long. Rujul is <i>khalaas</i>.

06:10.537 --> 06:12.581
Walidbhai sends his blessings.

06:12.581 --> 06:14.666
You would be wise to accept them.

06:23.592 --> 06:24.676
Listen to me.

06:26.303 --> 06:28.972
I can't treat it if I can't see it.

06:29.056 --> 06:30.933
No, I can't do this with you.

06:30.933 --> 06:33.268
Okay, look. Did you go to the hospital?

06:34.520 --> 06:38.941
Why don't you understand?
I am a married woman and can't do this!

06:40.025 --> 06:41.318
I just need to see it.

06:41.318 --> 06:43.654
Please do not touch me!
This white man is crazy.

06:44.238 --> 06:46.323
Okay, Sonam, why are you here?

06:46.323 --> 06:48.033
Somebody, please help me!

06:48.033 --> 06:49.743
Lin needs you quickly.

06:51.912 --> 06:55.249
Where are you taking her?
-She's got work to do!

07:01.004 --> 07:03.465
Parvati, thank God.
She won't let me examine her again.

07:03.549 --> 07:05.884
Parvati, please explain to him.

07:05.968 --> 07:08.720
He is touching me everywhere.
He was telling me to take off my sari!

07:08.804 --> 07:10.597
Lin, what is this? She's a married woman.

07:10.681 --> 07:14.226
You cannot be making her naked, alone,
the two of you in this hut.

07:14.226 --> 07:17.145
I told you this last time, <i>na</i>?
-Then why did she come back?

07:17.229 --> 07:19.565
If they're her bloody rules,
why doesn't she stick to them?

07:19.565 --> 07:22.401
Or bring her husband with her?
-Her husband is a working man.

07:22.401 --> 07:25.153
He is spending many hours
on the building site.

07:25.237 --> 07:27.239
He cannot just drop everything
and come to you.

07:27.239 --> 07:30.242
When you two have stopped arguing,
we are ready.

07:32.286 --> 07:33.996
Dr. Lin, now you ask.

07:36.081 --> 07:38.292
Look at her wound again. Please.

07:40.502 --> 07:41.962
Show me, Auntie.

07:44.506 --> 07:47.509
It looks redder and worse than last time.
Redness is spreading all around.

07:47.593 --> 07:50.721
It is looking red
and much worse than before.

07:52.514 --> 07:54.474
I can't eat or sleep.

07:54.558 --> 07:59.229
I'm sweating all night
and my stomach hurts.

07:59.771 --> 08:01.982
Also lots of sweating and stomach pain.

08:01.982 --> 08:04.026
There is sweating and pain in stomach.

08:04.610 --> 08:05.861
The infection's spread.

08:05.861 --> 08:08.780
All she had to do was go to the hospital
and get a shot.

08:10.657 --> 08:12.492
You did not go to the hospital?

08:12.576 --> 08:16.747
I went three times to the hospital,

08:16.747 --> 08:19.791
but you know how it is.
No one will see me.

08:21.251 --> 08:23.587
She tried three times to go,
but they didn't take her.

08:23.587 --> 08:26.173
She went three times,
but they did not take her.

08:27.007 --> 08:28.509
What do you mean, "not take her"?

08:28.509 --> 08:31.136
I'm sending people there 'cause I can't
give them what they need here.

08:31.220 --> 08:32.386
You are sending them there

08:32.471 --> 08:34.515
and then they are sending them here
back to you.

08:35.849 --> 08:37.433
Did you hear what I just said?

08:37.518 --> 08:39.436
If she doesn't get antibiotics,
she's gonna die.

08:43.148 --> 08:44.608
You know what? Fuck this.

08:45.651 --> 08:48.320
Parvati, tell Sonam
we're taking her to the hospital.

08:48.320 --> 08:51.448
I need you with me. And Parvati, you too.
-Linbaba, I have work to do.

08:51.532 --> 08:54.201
Okay, I'm coming. I'll help, of course.
-I'm going to fix this.

09:00.582 --> 09:03.877
Madam. A pleasure to meet you.
I am Akash Pandey.

09:04.419 --> 09:06.797
Thank you for meeting with me
on such short notice.

09:09.633 --> 09:12.678
Congratulations on your new position,
Minister Pandey.

09:12.678 --> 09:14.304
Nothing is decided as yet.

09:14.388 --> 09:16.306
I hear it is a formality.

09:16.390 --> 09:18.892
As I hope our business will be also.

09:21.144 --> 09:24.648
The development bid I represent
for Sagar Wada

09:24.648 --> 09:27.025
had already been approved
by Minister Aadekar.

09:27.901 --> 09:31.154
Four skyscrapers
overlooking the Cuffe Parade bay.

09:31.238 --> 09:34.783
Thirty floors,
four flats a floor, at five crores each.

09:34.867 --> 09:36.577
That's almost 200 million US

09:36.577 --> 09:40.289
with a plan how best to serve
the local community and economy.

09:41.039 --> 09:44.209
Naturally, we planned
to reward Rujul very generously.

09:44.293 --> 09:47.921
And in his sad absence,
those rewards would now come to you.

09:49.631 --> 09:53.635
I think you would find us to be very
appreciative partners, Minister Pandey.

09:54.261 --> 09:56.763
I'm sure. But...

09:57.472 --> 10:01.059
Well, madam, there is one tiny problem.

10:01.727 --> 10:02.728
And what is that?

10:03.228 --> 10:05.022
Sagar Wada is spoken for.

10:05.522 --> 10:08.066
Spoken for? By who?

10:08.150 --> 10:09.443
<i>Namaste.</i>

10:13.488 --> 10:14.615
I'm Walid Shah.

10:16.074 --> 10:17.451
Nice to meet you, Mr. Shah.

10:18.202 --> 10:19.536
I heard you were beautiful.

10:19.620 --> 10:22.122
The stories really don't
do you justice, huh?

10:23.498 --> 10:27.169
Khaderbhai's always had appreciation
for the fine things in life.

10:27.669 --> 10:31.048
Myself, I've always been
a little rougher in my ways.

10:31.882 --> 10:34.968
Now, I want to respect Khaderbhai.

10:36.136 --> 10:40.933
But if he makes any moves on my new friend
Minister Pandey, it will mean war.

10:40.933 --> 10:43.185
And fine things never survive a war,
madam.

10:44.353 --> 10:46.980
Mr. Shah, I represent a consortium--

10:47.064 --> 10:49.066
Don't, huh? We all know who we are.

10:49.066 --> 10:50.984
We all know what roles we have to play.

10:51.068 --> 10:54.988
Yours is to go and tell Khaderbhai
Sagar Wada is mine.

11:04.831 --> 11:08.335
All good, boss.
-<i>Mr. Ford. Mr. Ford.</i>

11:18.679 --> 11:21.849
Come, come, come.
Sit, sit, sit. Come, come. Sit, sit, sit.

11:22.432 --> 11:26.061
So busy I was today, but I have cleared
all my patients just for you.

11:26.061 --> 11:27.688
We appreciate it.
-Please, sit.

11:28.981 --> 11:31.233
So, Sonam here has
a seriously infected wound.

11:31.233 --> 11:33.068
She needs IV antibiotics.

11:33.068 --> 11:35.946
She's been here three times.
She keeps getting turned away.

11:37.406 --> 11:40.158
See, very busy I was.
But now I'll fit her in.

11:40.242 --> 11:41.952
Only for you, I'll fit her in.

11:48.417 --> 11:50.377
What? You want baksheesh to see her?

11:51.712 --> 11:54.006
This is a government hospital.
Supposed to be free.

11:54.506 --> 11:56.133
Do you have a physician's referral?

11:58.135 --> 12:00.637
How do I get one of those?
-Only from a doctor elsewhere.

12:00.721 --> 12:02.181
Who's gonna charge her for it.

12:02.181 --> 12:05.976
I need a referral or money,
or go and wait outside with the rest.

12:05.976 --> 12:08.562
This is the system.
Look, even she can understand as well.

12:08.562 --> 12:10.439
So you're just going to let her die?

12:11.023 --> 12:12.691
What kind of fucking doctor are you?

12:12.691 --> 12:14.693
We are seeing 600 patients every day.

12:14.693 --> 12:16.987
My staff and I
have not been paid in months.

12:16.987 --> 12:19.072
Who are you to tell me
about being a doctor?

12:19.156 --> 12:21.575
Get out now, you and your <i>faltu</i> friends.
-All right.

12:21.575 --> 12:23.327
I'm gonna bring security right now.
-Listen.

12:23.327 --> 12:24.411
Sorry, sir.

12:25.495 --> 12:26.872
Lin, we should go.

12:26.872 --> 12:29.791
There are many police here.
Big trouble. Come, quick.

13:00.072 --> 13:02.282
I didn't want to wake you.

13:04.076 --> 13:05.077
Thank you.

13:18.423 --> 13:19.758
How do you feel?

13:19.842 --> 13:20.968
Better.

13:21.844 --> 13:22.845
It's...

13:24.263 --> 13:26.765
less every day.

13:26.849 --> 13:28.892
Thank you, Sebastian,
for coming to get me.

13:30.352 --> 13:31.937
I had no one else I could call, so...

13:31.937 --> 13:33.689
Why would you call anyone else?

13:34.273 --> 13:36.942
I will look after you, Lisa.
You know this.

13:39.945 --> 13:42.030
I think it's time
I went back to my own place.

13:43.574 --> 13:44.908
Whatever you want.

13:48.036 --> 13:50.873
You know how I feel about you, Lisa.

13:54.209 --> 13:55.210
I do.

13:57.171 --> 14:01.800
And I care about you too. But I'm just...

14:04.011 --> 14:07.514
It's been a long time since I even knew
how to feel like that about anyone.

14:07.598 --> 14:08.974
Even myself.

14:18.400 --> 14:20.444
Will you come with me to my place?

14:20.444 --> 14:22.738
I don't wanna be there on my own.

14:25.616 --> 14:29.453
I'll hustle until we get enough money
for Sonam's medicine. Deal?

14:29.453 --> 14:30.913
Deal, Linbaba.

14:43.592 --> 14:44.843
Lin!

15:00.150 --> 15:02.694
Few weeks ago, I was one of you.

15:02.778 --> 15:04.947
I made all the mistakes
that you're about to make.

15:04.947 --> 15:08.450
So if you want to avoid that
and save some money, come talk to us.

15:08.534 --> 15:11.370
The more of you that come,
the cheaper it'll be.

15:11.370 --> 15:16.166
Good food, good price, good hotel,
very sexy business, boss.

15:16.250 --> 15:17.292
Come.
-Come.

15:25.759 --> 15:27.135
Did Rujul have to die?

15:27.719 --> 15:30.973
Once we knew, we could have confronted him
and brought him back to us.

15:30.973 --> 15:32.432
Now we're back to square one.

15:32.516 --> 15:34.142
I supported Rujul for 20 years.

15:34.226 --> 15:37.020
What kind of message would I send
if I allowed his betrayal?

15:38.355 --> 15:40.274
Tell me about the new minister, Pandey.

15:41.191 --> 15:43.652
He's well-respected
in the community and ministry.

15:44.319 --> 15:46.905
Devout Hindu,
wife of 12 years, two children.

15:47.739 --> 15:50.492
It was arranged.
She had money. He had a career.

15:50.576 --> 15:54.162
Her father funded his campaign.
Still does. Nothing stands out.

15:54.246 --> 15:56.707
Dig. All men have secrets.

15:57.374 --> 15:58.834
Let's see if his are useful.

15:58.834 --> 16:01.086
He is the key to Sagar Wada.

16:06.300 --> 16:08.552
How did it make you feel
when Walid appeared?

16:09.845 --> 16:10.888
Frightened.

16:11.555 --> 16:13.432
And he knew it. Enjoyed it.

16:14.641 --> 16:16.935
I felt very small and alone
in that moment.

16:19.980 --> 16:22.858
See you tomorrow morning.
-Thank you. Bye-bye.

16:25.110 --> 16:26.111
Here.

16:26.737 --> 16:29.072
Nah, nah, nah, no. I need all of it, mate.

16:31.825 --> 16:34.286
I need to buy medicine.
That's what I came down here for.

16:35.579 --> 16:38.916
Linbaba. Doctoring is your business, okay?
Not mine.

16:39.625 --> 16:42.961
My business is saving moneys
to marry Parvati.

16:44.171 --> 16:45.172
You're joking.

16:47.132 --> 16:49.134
Your plan won't even work, boss.

16:49.885 --> 16:53.305
Okay, even if I am giving you,
where are you getting the medicine?

16:54.264 --> 16:58.060
You're not having prescription,
ration card, ID card, no doctor's note.

16:59.144 --> 17:00.270
Illegal medicine.

17:01.188 --> 17:03.690
Nobody is knowing you,
trusting you, or selling it to you.

17:03.774 --> 17:08.237
Prabhu, Sonam is gonna die, for nothing.
-Lin, no one will blame you.

17:08.319 --> 17:09.613
I will blame me.

17:11.573 --> 17:12.574
You're fucked.

17:13.700 --> 17:16.078
Lin, where are you going?

17:16.078 --> 17:17.287
To buy medicine.

17:22.251 --> 17:23.877
There is no shame in being afraid.

17:25.921 --> 17:29.091
Courage is being scared and acting anyway.

17:38.016 --> 17:40.602
You will never be alone, Karla.

17:47.609 --> 17:51.488
And our developers,
do they need to be further appeased?

17:52.197 --> 17:55.075
Good. Did they like the ghazel singers?

17:55.075 --> 17:59.705
I didn't know you'd be there,
with such a strange bedfellow.

17:59.705 --> 18:02.624
I now know why you like Mr. Ford.

18:03.458 --> 18:04.751
What do you want with him?

18:06.545 --> 18:10.549
Well, maybe I just see someone
who needs help to find their path.

18:12.050 --> 18:13.719
You pretended not to know me.

18:15.012 --> 18:17.139
You didn't want him to know
we're connected.

18:17.139 --> 18:20.309
We've kept our relationship a secret
for your protection, not mine.

18:40.120 --> 18:41.622
Stinks of dope in here.

18:58.847 --> 19:00.641
Take what you need and we can go.

19:04.394 --> 19:05.646
Stay with me.

19:07.022 --> 19:08.190
Leave this shit behind.

19:08.190 --> 19:09.816
No, we have to clean it up.

19:10.317 --> 19:12.778
Lisa, there's no need--
-I have to clean this up.

19:17.741 --> 19:18.825
I have to.

19:22.496 --> 19:23.747
Do you understand?

19:37.010 --> 19:40.013
Hey, Ramesh, right? You remember me?

19:40.097 --> 19:42.391
I was here the other day
with Abdel Khader Khan.

19:42.391 --> 19:44.393
Listen, I need you to get a message to him

19:44.393 --> 19:46.812
that Lin Ford
wants to talk to him urgently.

19:46.812 --> 19:47.896
Can you do that?

19:47.980 --> 19:50.357
Yes. I will.
-All right. Good man.

19:50.858 --> 19:51.859
Sorry.

20:20.262 --> 20:21.597
I didn't...

20:21.597 --> 20:22.848
It's okay.

20:23.515 --> 20:26.351
If you need it,
if a little will help, then...

20:28.437 --> 20:29.646
Whatever you need.

20:31.190 --> 20:32.900
I need you to say no.

20:33.901 --> 20:35.903
I need you to fucking say no!

20:37.279 --> 20:40.741
Tell me when I'm wrong!
Stop me! Just fucking stop me!

20:40.741 --> 20:41.992
Why won't you--

20:49.708 --> 20:51.835
Don't just say yes to me, Modena.

20:53.253 --> 20:54.838
You wanna be there for me,

20:55.464 --> 20:59.134
you want there to be anything between us,
then don't just say yes to me.

21:00.219 --> 21:01.803
Be strong for me.

21:03.514 --> 21:07.726
Never let me touch that shit ever again,
no matter what.

21:08.644 --> 21:09.770
I promise.

21:11.313 --> 21:13.148
Let's get the fuck out of here.

21:34.336 --> 21:35.337
Mr. Lin.

21:49.935 --> 21:52.145
Lin, it's good to see you.

21:52.229 --> 21:55.899
Yeah, thank you for seeing me so quickly.
-You told Ramesh it was urgent.

21:55.983 --> 21:58.235
Yeah, look,
I'm sorry for bringing this to you,

21:58.235 --> 21:59.945
but I need medical supplies.

22:00.571 --> 22:04.867
I keep sending people to the hospitals,
but they get no help. Not unless they pay.

22:04.867 --> 22:07.619
I'm not looking for a handout.
I'll pay my own way.

22:07.703 --> 22:10.122
And what exactly are you asking for?

22:10.622 --> 22:13.417
I don't have a connection
for black market medical supplies.

22:14.585 --> 22:16.170
And you assume I do.

22:16.170 --> 22:18.463
Because... Why?

22:19.381 --> 22:20.924
I'm a gangster?

22:26.388 --> 22:28.265
No, I just... I th--

22:30.559 --> 22:32.686
That was a joke.

22:33.979 --> 22:36.899
Most people don't know this,
but when I first came to Bombay,

22:36.899 --> 22:39.610
I lived in a <i>jhopadpatti</i>
just like Sagar Wada.

22:40.194 --> 22:42.362
I will make this connection for you.

22:43.405 --> 22:44.865
Thank you, Khaderbhai.

22:44.865 --> 22:48.118
Abdullah will make the arrangements,
and he'll get in touch.

22:50.120 --> 22:51.288
Do you know when?

22:52.497 --> 22:54.625
It's just, there's this one woman
who's gonna die

22:54.625 --> 22:56.084
if I don't treat her quickly.

22:56.752 --> 23:00.214
Then we must hope, <i>inshallah</i>,
that, together, we can avoid this.

23:01.006 --> 23:02.341
It was nice seeing you, Lin.

23:05.719 --> 23:06.720
Thank you.

23:16.897 --> 23:18.482
I could take him now. Why wait?

23:18.982 --> 23:22.736
The more desperate Lin becomes,
the more grateful he will be.

23:24.321 --> 23:25.447
Turn it up.

23:41.964 --> 23:44.466
My supplier insists half payment up front,

23:44.550 --> 23:47.344
and then Modena brings you the goods
and you give him the rest.

23:49.471 --> 23:50.848
How do I know you will deliver?

23:53.267 --> 23:56.061
How long will my business last
if I cheat, huh?

23:56.061 --> 23:57.563
True.

23:57.563 --> 24:01.275
Hard to run a business
when you're in small, small pieces, huh?

24:04.111 --> 24:07.030
You know, you are a long way from home
to be making threats, Raheem.

24:07.948 --> 24:10.951
Buy it, or don't buy it.
I have plenty other business here.

24:10.951 --> 24:13.036
But if you could find
what you needed in Lagos,

24:13.120 --> 24:14.830
you wouldn't be in Bombay. You know?

24:22.504 --> 24:25.716
So you like these fellows, Lisa?
You think I should trust them?

24:26.758 --> 24:27.759
Absolutely.

24:28.343 --> 24:30.262
Do you know what we were talking about?

24:30.262 --> 24:31.430
No idea at all.

24:32.014 --> 24:34.641
But I trust them. They're my best friends.

24:37.895 --> 24:39.271
I don't know.

24:40.189 --> 24:42.357
But I'm going to trust you, I think.

24:43.317 --> 24:45.235
You are too beautiful to lie, huh?

24:46.028 --> 24:47.779
That would break my heart.

24:47.863 --> 24:48.864
All right.

24:50.032 --> 24:51.742
I'll take one kilo as a test run.

24:51.742 --> 24:53.619
If it's good, we can do more.

24:54.912 --> 24:55.913
Beautiful.

25:05.464 --> 25:06.465
Coffee.

25:08.884 --> 25:11.678
You know, Lin mentioned this man to me.

25:11.762 --> 25:15.516
Something to do with you and Lisa
and the Palace, I think.

25:16.225 --> 25:21.522
And now it seems that you and Lisa
are on the outs and Lin is gone.

25:21.522 --> 25:22.606
After all this time,

25:22.606 --> 25:25.400
you are going to start asking questions
that don't concern you?

25:25.484 --> 25:29.571
No, no, no. No. Actually, yes. Just one.

25:31.907 --> 25:33.659
Are you all right, <i>ma chère</i>?

25:34.743 --> 25:35.786
I'm fine.

25:37.579 --> 25:39.998
Lin is still here.
He's living in the slum.

25:40.832 --> 25:41.834
Excuse me.

25:41.834 --> 25:45.671
You just can't leave me like this.
Karla, please. Details.

25:55.389 --> 25:56.849
Spare me the lecture.

25:57.349 --> 25:59.351
I don't blame you for leaving. I just...

25:59.852 --> 26:01.311
wanna know you're all right.

26:01.395 --> 26:02.563
How big of you.

26:03.981 --> 26:05.983
You know how superior that sounds?

26:06.692 --> 26:08.151
You should come back.

26:08.235 --> 26:09.444
You're not what I need.

26:09.528 --> 26:10.946
And those two are?

26:10.946 --> 26:13.448
I thought you wanted to change, Lisa.
-Fuck off, Karla.

26:14.366 --> 26:16.410
You've never trusted me
and you never will.

26:17.828 --> 26:20.414
I'm not using. I'm not hooking.

26:20.998 --> 26:22.791
I'm working really hard to stay clean.

26:24.293 --> 26:25.961
Modena's helping me with that.

26:26.920 --> 26:28.881
He actually means it
when he says he loves me.

26:29.673 --> 26:31.466
They're gonna get you into trouble.

26:31.550 --> 26:32.759
And you didn't?

26:34.303 --> 26:35.804
Seen the papers lately?

26:37.764 --> 26:39.600
And you're just sad, Karla.

26:40.475 --> 26:42.269
Deep down, you're just sad.

26:43.270 --> 26:45.939
And I don't wanna be sad,
I wanna have fun. Remember that?

26:46.732 --> 26:51.111
To laugh, joke, smile? That's what I want.

27:08.670 --> 27:09.922
Prabhu, right?

27:11.632 --> 27:13.050
Yes, and you are Karla Ma'am.

27:13.550 --> 27:15.719
I'm looking for Lin.
Can you take me to him?

27:15.719 --> 27:18.680
I am in the middle of
tourist guide business. Sorry, huh?

27:18.764 --> 27:21.850
How about you guide me to Lin?

27:34.488 --> 27:37.741
See,
Lin is giving lots of dollars to build.

27:37.741 --> 27:39.952
Why?
-He's a good man.

27:39.952 --> 27:41.578
Good friend of Sagar Wada.

27:41.662 --> 27:44.957
My good friend first, but now
everyone is loving him too much, huh?

27:44.957 --> 27:47.793
Big doctor he is now,
healing everyone all day long.

27:48.752 --> 27:50.254
Can we get <i>chai nashta</i>...

27:50.254 --> 27:52.631
for me and my good friend, Karla Ma'am.

27:53.131 --> 27:54.675
How dare you show your face here!

27:54.675 --> 27:56.176
Where did you take Parvati all day?

27:56.260 --> 27:58.846
Hospital only, with Linbaba.
-Hospital only. Please!

27:58.846 --> 28:01.431
I chose to go. Don't blame him.

28:01.515 --> 28:03.559
You two were roaming around Colaba
the whole day.

28:03.559 --> 28:04.643
We did nothing wrong.

28:04.643 --> 28:06.979
We were helping to save a life, Mother.

28:06.979 --> 28:09.231
We were looking for you since morning.

28:09.231 --> 28:11.108
Ask anyone. We have been looking for you.

28:12.776 --> 28:14.736
You should have told us.

28:22.160 --> 28:23.829
How'd you get in here?

28:23.829 --> 28:25.956
I didn't realize it was illegal to visit.

28:26.957 --> 28:29.084
I paid your friend Prabhu to bring me.

28:31.753 --> 28:34.131
Prabhu told me you gave them
money to rebuild.

28:34.756 --> 28:36.466
I assume that's the money I gave you.

28:36.967 --> 28:39.011
Yep.
-Linbaba.

28:41.346 --> 28:43.140
No wonder you're so popular.

28:50.272 --> 28:52.232
What are you still doing here, Lin?

28:52.316 --> 28:54.276
A few days ago,
you were desperate to get out,

28:54.276 --> 28:55.694
and now you're playing doctor.

28:57.404 --> 28:59.656
These people helped me
when no one else would.

29:06.205 --> 29:08.081
Look, someone came after me here.

29:08.165 --> 29:10.375
Zhou, I guess, looking to finish me off.

29:11.710 --> 29:13.253
That's how the fire started.

29:15.088 --> 29:16.548
And how is that your fault?

29:19.009 --> 29:21.220
That little boy's mum is dead
because of me.

29:25.766 --> 29:27.017
I owe them.

29:27.017 --> 29:29.978
I got one thing I can give them,
as useless as I am at it.

29:32.564 --> 29:34.274
Aren't you worried
about someone else coming,

29:34.358 --> 29:35.692
about your passport situation?

29:35.776 --> 29:36.985
I'm fucking terrified.

29:37.069 --> 29:40.113
But Lakshmi was scared too,
so I don't get to use that as an excuse.

29:57.381 --> 29:58.465
I saw the paper.

29:59.508 --> 30:00.926
That Rujul fella's dead.

30:01.885 --> 30:03.846
Do I have to feel guilty
about that as well?

30:03.846 --> 30:05.097
No.

30:05.097 --> 30:08.308
"No," because you don't care,
or because it's got nothing to do with us?

30:08.392 --> 30:09.726
Both.

30:09.810 --> 30:12.229
Rujul Aadekar was a corrupt official.

30:12.896 --> 30:15.148
He was hurting
a client of mine's business.

30:15.941 --> 30:17.609
I wanted to warn him.

30:17.693 --> 30:19.069
That's as far as it goes.

30:20.571 --> 30:22.406
The papers say he got robbed.

30:23.031 --> 30:26.076
Rich man in the wrong part of Bombay.
It happens.

30:31.665 --> 30:33.250
What are you doing here, Karla?

30:33.959 --> 30:35.919
I got a shock seeing you the other night.

30:37.004 --> 30:38.881
I assumed you'd turn up at Reynaldo's.

30:38.881 --> 30:42.176
When you didn't, I just...
-Easy. I might start to think you care.

30:45.846 --> 30:47.598
Guess I probably deserve that.

30:48.098 --> 30:50.767
Although, to be fair,
you did give me the money to leave.

30:50.851 --> 30:52.394
And then you gave it away.

30:53.312 --> 30:54.313
Yep.

30:55.564 --> 30:57.482
What were you doing with Khader Khan?

30:58.692 --> 31:01.111
Smoking, drinking tea.

31:01.195 --> 31:04.364
For a man who doesn't want trouble,
you keep interesting company.

31:04.448 --> 31:05.616
Does that include you?

31:06.200 --> 31:09.244
I hope so. I'd hate not to be interesting.

31:10.954 --> 31:12.623
Yeah, I can't see that happening.

31:13.832 --> 31:15.501
Too bloody mysterious.

31:19.505 --> 31:21.006
I should be getting back.

31:25.344 --> 31:27.429
Poverty looks good on you, Lin.

31:28.347 --> 31:31.517
If you get really down and out,
you could be irresistible.

31:35.312 --> 31:36.563
Don't be a stranger.

32:02.714 --> 32:05.509
You're going to make her better, Dr. Lin?

32:06.593 --> 32:09.137
Why isn't he doing anything?

32:10.806 --> 32:12.891
Can't you give her medicine?

32:36.748 --> 32:39.710
All right, what are we doing?
Getting them in the bowl?

32:40.294 --> 32:41.879
You can do it!

32:41.879 --> 32:44.673
Yeah!
-So close.

32:48.468 --> 32:50.137
So close.

33:01.231 --> 33:03.066
Go on, Jitendra, old mate.

33:23.921 --> 33:25.672
Linbaba, you are home?

33:28.425 --> 33:29.468
Linbaba.

33:31.845 --> 33:33.013
Lin.

33:33.013 --> 33:34.973
Yes, Prabhu, I'm home.

33:42.648 --> 33:44.274
You've already eaten, Lin?

33:44.358 --> 33:45.400
No, not yet.

33:45.484 --> 33:50.197
Good, because Ravi is bringing you
<i>ekdum</i> special food now.

34:00.207 --> 34:03.293
Bombil. This is Bombay duck.

34:03.377 --> 34:05.921
Most famousest of fishes.

34:06.713 --> 34:08.632
Eat. Eat, <i>na</i>?

34:08.632 --> 34:11.385
It looks amazing, Ravi. Thank you.
You didn't have to do--

34:11.467 --> 34:13.637
Sorry I am trying to hurt you.

35:04.605 --> 35:05.939
<i>Maybe Karla was right.</i>

35:06.607 --> 35:08.275
<i>Maybe I courted danger.</i>

35:08.275 --> 35:11.820
<i>Because danger in the here and now
was one of the few things strong enough</i>

35:11.904 --> 35:13.572
<i>to help me forget the past.</i>

35:29.171 --> 35:31.131
See, Johnny? He's been going again.

35:33.258 --> 35:34.635
How are you this morning, Lin?

35:35.260 --> 35:36.261
Peachy.

35:36.845 --> 35:40.224
See, he's saying this,
but he's meaning the opposite. I can tell.

35:40.224 --> 35:43.769
And he's already been making motion
once this morning. I saw him.

35:43.769 --> 35:44.937
Jitendra was right.

35:45.521 --> 35:46.939
What are you two going on about?

35:46.939 --> 35:49.233
Linbaba,
your neighbor Jitendra is telling us

35:49.233 --> 35:52.027
last night, you have been to the water
three, four times.

35:52.027 --> 35:53.612
Keeping him up all night, you are.

35:53.612 --> 35:54.821
Jitendra's one to talk.

35:54.905 --> 35:57.115
Him and his missus were going at it
hammer and tongs.

35:57.658 --> 36:01.620
Jitendra and Ratna's sexy time
is most famous in Sagar Wada.

36:01.620 --> 36:03.497
You tell, you are having loose motion?

36:03.997 --> 36:06.333
Yes.
All right, Prabhu, I've got the shits.

36:06.333 --> 36:07.501
Are you happy now?

36:08.418 --> 36:10.963
I can't help thinking it was that fish
you and Ravi brought me.

36:10.963 --> 36:12.589
<i>Arre</i>, Lin, no.

36:12.673 --> 36:15.843
He caught that fish himself
as a peace offering to you.

36:15.843 --> 36:18.887
He-- Very fresh. He brought it to me
to help him bring to you.

36:18.971 --> 36:20.514
Okay. It wasn't the fish.

36:21.014 --> 36:23.475
I recommend a drinking of chandu chai.

36:23.559 --> 36:26.186
It will make your motions harder
and good color again.

36:28.397 --> 36:30.566
Mr. Lin, you must come with me.

36:32.025 --> 36:34.820
He's a very danger man, Lin.
Murderous fellow.

36:34.820 --> 36:36.989
It's all right, Prabhu. I know him.

36:36.989 --> 36:38.365
How are you knowing him?

36:38.949 --> 36:39.950
Don't worry about it.

36:39.950 --> 36:42.619
If anything happens to you
with this man, I cannot help you.

36:44.621 --> 36:45.706
What is the problem?

36:45.706 --> 36:46.832
No, there's no problem.

36:48.667 --> 36:50.752
I am only wondering
where you're taking Lin.

36:52.337 --> 36:55.966
He's my partner and we are having business
in the side <i>gully</i> of Regal.

36:57.551 --> 36:58.677
What is your name?

36:59.845 --> 37:00.846
Prabhu.

37:01.680 --> 37:03.515
You must be a big man,
asking me questions.

37:03.599 --> 37:05.475
Maybe I should call you "Prabhubhai."

37:06.101 --> 37:08.645
<i>Maalik</i> of Colaba Market.
<i>Sarkar</i> of Sagar Wada?

37:08.729 --> 37:13.775
Go now, back to your backside business.
-Easy. Abdullah, he's my friend. Please.

37:18.488 --> 37:20.032
You want your medicine or not?

37:25.287 --> 37:26.330
It's fine.

38:41.738 --> 38:44.616
Tell Auntie Ruby
that Abdullah Taheri has come.

38:48.453 --> 38:51.206
I'll make the introduction.
The rest is up to you.

39:22.279 --> 39:23.614
<i>Namaste</i>, Auntie.

39:25.157 --> 39:28.035
This is Ruby. Boss of Kala Topis.

39:28.035 --> 39:30.037
The best smugglers and thieves
in all Bombay.

39:31.079 --> 39:34.374
Greetings. My name is Lin.

39:38.003 --> 39:39.421
Show her your list.

39:42.007 --> 39:43.592
It's in English.

39:45.093 --> 39:49.932
I can get it translated if you need.

39:50.724 --> 39:53.018
I wasn't born like this, you know.

39:53.936 --> 39:55.979
Once, I was a chartered accountant

39:56.688 --> 39:58.607
with my own flat in Mahalakshmi.

39:59.316 --> 40:00.734
I meant no offense.

40:02.236 --> 40:03.737
Will you take tea with me?

40:08.325 --> 40:09.326
Sure.

41:33.827 --> 41:35.495
I can get you all of this.

41:36.788 --> 41:39.291
One lakh. 50,000 rupees.

41:39.291 --> 41:40.918
I don't have that much money.

41:42.252 --> 41:43.712
I was hoping that you could--

41:45.130 --> 41:46.965
that we could make some kind of deal.

41:48.717 --> 41:49.843
Discount?

41:50.511 --> 41:52.471
These people have nowhere else to turn.

41:55.474 --> 41:57.434
You want me to help these people,

41:59.269 --> 42:01.355
who'd turn their backs on us?

42:02.981 --> 42:04.983
Forcing us to live here like animals?

42:06.485 --> 42:11.740
No. I'm a businesswoman.
This is the price.

42:23.919 --> 42:26.004
At least give me
the antibiotics and the IVs.

42:34.721 --> 42:37.140
Give him the penicillin and two IV kits.

42:43.105 --> 42:44.106
Keep it.

42:45.107 --> 42:47.359
I'll be back for the rest
when I raise the money.

43:06.670 --> 43:09.089
Could you pull over?
-What?

43:09.173 --> 43:10.299
I need the toilet.

43:10.841 --> 43:12.092
Toilet?
-Yeah.

43:14.428 --> 43:15.429
In there.

43:16.138 --> 43:17.222
Here?
-Yes.

43:18.640 --> 43:19.641
Hold that.

43:24.229 --> 43:25.939
Mate. This a toilet?

44:00.516 --> 44:03.060
You're dead, sisterfucker.

44:30.838 --> 44:32.756
Today you die, Rafiq.

44:33.549 --> 44:36.176
Hey! Hey, hey. Hey.

44:36.260 --> 44:38.011
No one has to die here today.

44:43.851 --> 44:46.186
We need to be somewhere else. Now.

45:15.090 --> 45:17.259
Mate, I need to get these supplies back.

45:17.259 --> 45:18.552
And I will take you.

45:18.552 --> 45:21.305
Faster than if you walk,
but I want to speak with you first.

45:22.931 --> 45:24.933
Sitaphal. My favorite.

45:26.185 --> 45:28.854
Then try chikoo and the sweet lime.

45:30.856 --> 45:34.484
What, so that's it?
Try to kill a guy and then eat ice cream?

45:36.153 --> 45:39.072
Should've let me.
There'll be trouble down the road.

45:41.491 --> 45:42.701
It wouldn't bother you?

45:45.913 --> 45:49.458
Before I came here, in Iran,
killing was all I knew.

45:50.584 --> 45:53.629
Just didn't know why.
I went where I was pointed.

45:57.132 --> 45:58.342
I had two brothers,

45:59.301 --> 46:00.302
gone now.

46:01.553 --> 46:03.514
It's a bad thing to be an only brother.

46:04.640 --> 46:07.142
Now... Now I know what I fight for.

46:08.977 --> 46:10.062
Khaderbhai.

46:11.313 --> 46:12.314
Yes.

46:14.441 --> 46:16.610
Khaderbhai is a man who makes the future.

46:16.610 --> 46:18.862
Us, we wait for the future to come.

46:19.488 --> 46:22.866
But he dreams the future, plans it,
and makes it happen.

46:25.869 --> 46:28.872
When Khaderbhai sent me to you,
I was not sure.

46:29.748 --> 46:32.084
What kind of man is this <i>gora</i>
who wants to be a doctor?

46:35.254 --> 46:36.880
But you saved my life today.

46:38.048 --> 46:39.174
And I saved yours.

46:40.467 --> 46:42.469
Khaderbhai saw something true with us.

46:42.970 --> 46:45.347
Perhaps we really are looking
like brothers.

46:49.601 --> 46:52.604
Abdullah, I can't get involved
in whatever it is you guys do.

46:54.773 --> 46:57.734
I need Khaderbhai to understand
that I need to stay invisible.

46:59.152 --> 47:01.780
No trouble. No attention.

47:02.781 --> 47:04.491
What you want matters little.

47:05.576 --> 47:09.246
People like us,
our destiny has already been written.

47:18.255 --> 47:20.549
I really do need
to get these supplies back.

47:46.074 --> 47:47.784
The fucking latrines?

47:48.493 --> 47:49.536
Ravi.

47:51.163 --> 47:53.081
Have you been feeding me shit fish?

47:54.291 --> 47:55.334
This one...

47:58.545 --> 47:59.546
is for you too.

48:02.341 --> 48:03.425
Good one, mate.

48:05.427 --> 48:07.346
Are you telling Qasim <i>Chacha</i>?

48:09.473 --> 48:11.099
No.
-Why?

48:13.310 --> 48:15.604
'Cause I'm hoping one day
maybe you won't hate me.

48:31.370 --> 48:32.579
Yeah, okay. Great.

48:39.336 --> 48:41.255
How do you say, "You will get better now"?

48:47.845 --> 48:49.137
Sonam.

49:08.240 --> 49:09.658
No, no, no.

49:22.171 --> 49:24.423
You think Walid sent Rafiq after you

49:24.423 --> 49:26.091
because of Sagar Wada?

49:26.175 --> 49:27.176
No.

49:27.176 --> 49:29.052
Just because the <i>bhais</i>
and their councils make peace

49:29.136 --> 49:30.637
does not mean the soldiers forget.

49:31.138 --> 49:32.222
Rafiq hates me.

49:32.306 --> 49:34.808
He saw me alone,
and he tried to take his chance.

49:35.434 --> 49:37.227
He would've done it, if not for Lin.

49:37.311 --> 49:38.604
He saved your life.

49:38.604 --> 49:40.898
Risked his own to do it. No hesitation.

49:41.690 --> 49:44.860
But he would not let me kill Rafiq.
He's a strange man.

49:45.861 --> 49:47.112
You like him?

49:47.196 --> 49:49.198
I do. He has honor.

49:50.199 --> 49:51.617
He got what he needed from Ruby?

49:51.617 --> 49:53.785
Only a small part.
He doesn't have any money.

49:53.869 --> 49:54.870
Not for what he needs.

49:56.830 --> 49:59.666
What price would I put on your life,
Abdullah?

50:00.667 --> 50:03.420
This is the gift he gave us today,
this new brother of yours.

50:05.881 --> 50:06.882
And Rafiq?

50:08.008 --> 50:09.009
Do I finish it?

50:10.052 --> 50:11.053
No.

50:14.431 --> 50:15.557
Not now.

50:16.225 --> 50:20.437
If war with Walid must come,
we cannot be the ones who started it.

50:21.104 --> 50:22.314
What if he tries again?

50:22.981 --> 50:24.650
Make sure no one finds his body.

50:50.259 --> 50:51.718
You're a hard man to find.

50:53.095 --> 50:55.347
Abdullah. What are you doing here?

50:56.890 --> 50:58.559
Khader sent me back to Ruby.

50:59.852 --> 51:01.144
What does he want for it?

51:02.187 --> 51:04.439
Perhaps Khaderbhai knows
that your pride will get in the way

51:04.523 --> 51:05.983
of all the good work you are doing.

51:09.570 --> 51:11.280
Do you want it or not?

51:18.662 --> 51:22.207
Now you are also part of the plan,
isn't it so?

51:23.208 --> 51:25.377
<i>I knew I'd made a deal with the devil,</i>

51:25.377 --> 51:28.797
<i>but whatever it was,
I wanted to be part of it.</i>

51:29.506 --> 51:31.675
<i>A man in my position
should have been afraid.</i>

51:32.176 --> 51:33.510
<i>Instead I was excited.</i>
