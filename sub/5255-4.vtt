What am I supposed to do?

00:08.903 --> 00:10.237
You're leaving?

00:10.239 --> 00:11.488
You and Bixby almost died

00:11.539 --> 00:13.156
because that thing came after me.

[Screams]

00:15.126 --> 00:16.743
If anything ever happened to you,

00:16.745 --> 00:17.911
I couldn't live with myself.

00:17.962 --> 00:22.799
- That's it.

Let's just try to keep him steady.

- He's losing too much blood.
- He's gonna be okay.

00:39.400 --> 00:42.402
Get him out of here. Get him out of here.

00:42.436 --> 00:43.687

- Come on. Let's go.

00:43.738 --> 00:47.240
- I'm right here.
- Just wait out here.

00:47.275 --> 00:48.241
Lannon.

00:48.276 --> 00:49.776
Yeah?

00:49.827 --> 00:51.611
You're under arrest.

00:51.613 --> 00:52.612
What? What for?

00:52.614 --> 00:53.697
Desertion of duty.

No, I got to be here. I got to be here.

00:56.450 --> 00:58.867

- Strip.
- Forward.

01:11.687 --> 01:13.889
Strip.

01:13.940 --> 01:15.557
No.

01:15.608 --> 01:17.893
- Scan him.
- Put him down.

01:17.944 --> 01:20.729
Strip. I said strip!

01:20.780 --> 01:24.316
You strip, or you go into the hole.

01:24.318 --> 01:25.817
Get him out of here.

01:25.868 --> 01:27.619
Next.

01:27.653 --> 01:30.121
Strip.

01:30.156 --> 01:32.624
What are you looking at? Strip.

01:32.658 --> 01:33.625
Okay.

01:33.659 --> 01:36.328
- Lannon.
- [Door closes]

01:36.379 --> 01:39.581
AWOL. Theft of government property.

01:39.632 --> 01:42.801
You got something against Vega?

01:42.835 --> 01:46.671
- You'll speak when spoken to.
- Speak.

01:49.509 --> 01:53.011
And I'm speaking to you.

It appears so.

04:09.115 --> 04:12.617
We couldn't stop the bleeding,
so I brought you here.

04:12.652 --> 04:16.237
The blade is Empyrean steel.

04:16.288 --> 04:19.491
It should have killed me.

04:21.827 --> 04:23.628
Where is it?

04:23.663 --> 04:25.630
I don't know. I never saw it.

04:25.665 --> 04:27.215
We must find that blade.

Michael.

You deserve better, Becca.

04:45.434 --> 04:48.687
You shouldn't have to live
a life cloaked in secrecy.

There are good men in Vega,

No doubt you would have
been spotted on radar.

06:34.593 --> 06:36.294
Soldiers will be en route.

06:36.296 --> 06:38.797
Oh. [Laughs] You do like her.

06:38.799 --> 06:41.432
Uriel, enough.

06:41.467 --> 06:44.769
Why are you here?

06:44.804 --> 06:48.022
You've been keeping
something from the rest of us.

Meet me up north.

Bixby.

07:26.847 --> 07:30.481
Hi.

07:30.516 --> 07:32.183
They told me you were
finally out of surgery,

07:32.234 --> 07:35.687
so I brought you a friend
to keep you company.

07:35.689 --> 07:38.106
[Laughs] Cute, huh?

07:38.157 --> 07:40.859
Yeah. He was here.

07:40.861 --> 07:42.160
Who was here?

07:42.194 --> 07:45.029
The chosen one.

07:46.699 --> 07:48.783
Um, when?

07:48.834 --> 07:50.785
Last night. He brought in Michael.

07:50.836 --> 07:52.537
He was here in the infirmary?

07:52.539 --> 07:54.205
Was he all right?

07:54.207 --> 07:57.508
Soldiers took him in handcuffs.

07:57.543 --> 08:00.962

Hi. Excuse me.

08:02.048 --> 08:04.465
Okay.

08:04.516 --> 08:08.686
Um, so I have to go now,
but I am gonna come back,

08:08.721 --> 08:10.471

better real soon, okay?

08:14.193 --> 08:15.810

Okay.

08:19.064 --> 08:21.733

You're all set, Senator Frost.

08:26.573 --> 08:28.456
Thank you.

08:28.490 --> 08:31.459
May the Savior bless you.

08:36.749 --> 08:38.582
We have a long agenda.

08:38.634 --> 08:40.551
Let's begin with Senator Blake's proposal

08:40.586 --> 08:41.919
for increased defense spending.

08:41.922 --> 08:46.808
Actually, General, all this time, money,

08:46.842 --> 08:49.844
and energy might be put to better use

08:49.895 --> 08:53.932
if the chosen one would
simply reveal himself.

08:53.983 --> 08:56.234
Might make our defense budget obsolete.

08:56.268 --> 08:58.603
Well, yes, and if the tooth fairy

08:58.605 --> 08:59.938
should visit our pillows tonight,

08:59.989 --> 09:02.073
that would solve our budget issues too.

09:02.107 --> 09:05.860
[Laughter]

09:05.911 --> 09:06.861
Moving on.

09:06.912 --> 09:07.946
I'd rather not.

09:07.948 --> 09:09.364
We're in a crisis, Frost. Please.

09:09.415 --> 09:13.251
Rumor has it that the
child is here in Vega.

09:13.285 --> 09:15.536
Our time of waiting may well be over.

[All murmuring]

09:17.790 --> 09:20.174

09:20.209 --> 09:25.513

09:25.547 --> 09:27.849
The chosen one is here.

09:27.883 --> 09:31.269
[All murmuring]

09:31.303 --> 09:33.054
It's me.

09:33.105 --> 09:36.808

09:36.810 --> 09:40.478
Your hope is inspirational
as always, Senator.

09:40.529 --> 09:42.981
Let's keep our prayers in our hearts

09:42.983 --> 09:45.066
and move on with the
business of running Vega.

09:45.117 --> 09:46.901
- Hear, hear.
- Agreed.

09:46.952 --> 09:50.071
I cede the floor.

09:57.254 --> 09:58.705
You ordered Furiad to kill me.

09:58.739 --> 10:01.307
Oh, I've wanted to, even dreamed about it,

10:01.342 --> 10:04.761
but good old Furiad acted on his own.

10:04.812 --> 10:07.430
So hard to control that temper of his.

10:07.481 --> 10:08.431
Well, it's getting increasingly hard

10:08.482 --> 10:09.432
to control mine.

10:09.483 --> 10:13.186
Boys, calm down.

10:13.237 --> 10:15.488
Take a deep breath.

10:15.523 --> 10:17.607
It's time for talk, not a fight.

10:17.658 --> 10:19.943
You should know better than
to stick us in the same room.

10:19.994 --> 10:23.997
First off, you, kill
all the humans you want,

10:24.031 --> 10:26.666
but when it comes to
Michael, you don't touch him.

10:26.700 --> 10:30.703
I told you I had nothing
to do with the attack.

10:30.754 --> 10:34.841
Furiad's your soldier, and
he almost killed our brother,

10:34.875 --> 10:36.426
although I don't blame him.

10:36.460 --> 10:38.761
How could you keep the
child a secret from us?

10:38.796 --> 10:41.347
An odd question coming from
the sister who won't tell us

10:41.382 --> 10:43.550
where she's been for the last 25 years.

10:43.552 --> 10:45.935
Father's markings were meant
for all of us, not just you.

10:45.970 --> 10:47.637
I had to protect him from Gabriel.

10:47.688 --> 10:50.440
Didn't Father teach us to share our toys?

10:50.474 --> 10:51.808
Quiet, Gabriel.

10:51.859 --> 10:53.610
You idiots have fought a thousand times,

10:53.644 --> 10:55.645
but never like this.

10:55.696 --> 10:58.147
You've got to end it.

10:58.199 --> 11:00.650
You could end it.

11:03.571 --> 11:08.374
Is that why you're gracing
us with your presence, Uriel?

11:08.409 --> 11:13.046
You've finally chosen a side.

11:13.080 --> 11:17.417
Uriel, you love mankind as
much as I do, so protect them.

11:17.468 --> 11:20.420
I'm here to remind you

11:20.422 --> 11:23.590
we're all we've got left.

11:23.592 --> 11:25.225
That's why I never choose sides.

11:25.259 --> 11:29.095
[Chuckles] I love you both.

11:29.097 --> 11:31.931
Even Michael?

11:31.982 --> 11:33.933
Who spent the last two decades

11:33.935 --> 11:36.185
soaking his steel in the blood of angels?

11:36.237 --> 11:38.438
Don't pretend you care
about the eight-balls.

11:38.440 --> 11:40.273
You use them as cannon fodder.

11:40.324 --> 11:41.774
What's that supposed to mean?

11:41.776 --> 11:43.159
Our brother's learned a new trick.

11:43.193 --> 11:45.078
He can possess the eight-balls.

11:45.112 --> 11:46.579
That's disgusting.

11:46.614 --> 11:48.748
It's no different than what
Michael does with the child.

11:48.782 --> 11:50.116
I've never forced him to do anything.

11:50.118 --> 11:53.419
But you will.

11:53.454 --> 11:56.422
Does the child know
about your colorful past?

11:56.457 --> 12:00.627
Is that a threat?

12:00.678 --> 12:02.845
I'm taking the high road,

12:02.880 --> 12:05.465
waiting for the child
to find his true nature

12:05.467 --> 12:08.935
and come to me on his own,
like he's destined to do.

12:08.969 --> 12:10.637
Stay away from him, Gabriel.

12:10.688 --> 12:12.221
[Chuckles]

12:12.273 --> 12:15.608
Enjoy some quality time
with the boy while you can.

_

12:56.016 --> 12:58.151
Lannon.

13:00.154 --> 13:02.572
You got a visitor.

13:02.606 --> 13:05.191
What?

13:08.195 --> 13:09.529
You can leave us now.

13:09.580 --> 13:11.831
Lady Riesen, you have no idea
what this man is capable of.

13:11.865 --> 13:13.366
I'm okay.

13:13.417 --> 13:16.336
[Sighs] Close it up.

13:23.844 --> 13:27.547
Claire.

13:27.549 --> 13:31.934
What did they do to you, Alex?

13:31.969 --> 13:34.387
Nothing I didn't deserve.

13:34.389 --> 13:37.223
I had to keep the tattoos hidden.

13:37.225 --> 13:38.891
I wouldn't have even known you were here

13:38.942 --> 13:41.728
if it wasn't for Bixby.

13:41.779 --> 13:43.563
How is she?

13:43.614 --> 13:45.782
She's okay.

13:45.816 --> 13:47.784
- And Michael?
- Yeah, he's fine.

13:47.818 --> 13:49.369
Listen, Alex, I'm gonna speak to my dad,

13:49.403 --> 13:50.870
and I'm gonna get you out of here, okay?

13:50.904 --> 13:53.956
No. No.

13:57.127 --> 14:01.130
It's safer if I'm in here.

14:01.165 --> 14:03.800
People around me get hurt.

14:03.834 --> 14:08.671
You, Bix, Michael.

14:08.722 --> 14:12.225
I don't want to find out who's next.

14:12.259 --> 14:15.478
So when Bixby asks to see you,

14:15.512 --> 14:18.564
what...

14:18.599 --> 14:22.602
what do you want me to say to her?

14:26.824 --> 14:32.028
You tell her to always
listen to her Aunt Claire,

14:32.079 --> 14:33.913
and you tell her I miss her.

14:33.947 --> 14:37.033
Why don't you just
write her a letter, Alex?

14:37.084 --> 14:39.285
You know, like your dad did for you.

14:39.287 --> 14:41.871
That was different.

14:41.922 --> 14:44.090
How?

14:49.463 --> 14:51.214
[Knocking]

14:55.185 --> 14:59.055
- Release him.
- Yes, ma'am.

15:12.619 --> 15:15.204
Has my company really been that unpleasant?

15:15.239 --> 15:16.372
No, not at all.

15:16.406 --> 15:18.241
Then stop watching for your shift change

15:18.292 --> 15:21.911
and come join me for a drink.

15:21.962 --> 15:24.547
He keeps the good stuff at the back.

15:32.723 --> 15:35.141
You're not like other
soldiers, are you, Sergeant?

15:35.175 --> 15:36.342
No, I'm not.

15:36.344 --> 15:38.511
I have a functioning brain, ma'am.

15:38.513 --> 15:40.346
[Chuckles]

15:40.397 --> 15:45.184
Yes, but there's something else.

15:45.186 --> 15:50.189
Something deep inside.

15:50.191 --> 15:53.025
I'm intuitive.

15:53.027 --> 15:56.946
Makes me a shrewd negotiator.

15:56.997 --> 15:59.499
I know when someone's hiding something,

15:59.533 --> 16:05.254
and you, my dear,

16:05.289 --> 16:10.042
are guilty as charged.

16:10.044 --> 16:15.598
All right, you really want to know?

16:15.632 --> 16:18.134
I'm scared of heights.

16:18.185 --> 16:19.602
Hmm.

16:19.636 --> 16:22.388
I understand if you don't want to share.

16:22.390 --> 16:24.891
I'm from Helena, after all.

16:28.891 --> 16:31.280
Happy drinking.

16:31.315 --> 16:33.900
Fingers crossed Whele
doesn't feed you to his lions.

16:38.655 --> 16:40.406
You know, when I eventually return home,

16:40.408 --> 16:42.909
I'll need someone at my side

16:42.911 --> 16:46.963
to protect my interests.

16:46.997 --> 16:50.049
Why would I ever leave Vega?

16:50.083 --> 16:52.468
Why would you ever stay?

16:59.426 --> 17:02.311
Here you go, sweetie.

17:02.346 --> 17:03.596
Enjoy.

17:03.647 --> 17:06.482
Thank you.

17:06.516 --> 17:08.434
Alex.

17:08.484 --> 17:10.102
Bix.

17:10.104 --> 17:11.686
Hey.

17:11.738 --> 17:12.855
Easy, easy.

17:12.906 --> 17:14.440
You'll pop your stitches.

17:14.442 --> 17:16.943
What flavor did they stick you with?

17:16.944 --> 17:18.277
Red.

17:18.279 --> 17:20.329
You know, there used to be more colors.

17:20.364 --> 17:22.448
What did they taste like?

17:22.499 --> 17:24.916
- Red.
- [Both chuckle]

17:28.589 --> 17:31.290
It's not your fault.

17:35.095 --> 17:38.381
Yeah, it is.

17:38.432 --> 17:40.549
It is my fault.

17:44.304 --> 17:45.388
Here.

17:45.439 --> 17:47.440
I saved an extra.

17:47.474 --> 17:49.942
You take it.

17:49.977 --> 17:51.811
All right.

17:57.484 --> 17:59.068
They don't make it how they used to.

17:59.119 --> 18:00.703
[Chuckles]

18:05.742 --> 18:08.327
Hey.

18:08.329 --> 18:11.330
Frost has been begging to show off

18:11.332 --> 18:17.219
this irrigation system for weeks.

18:17.254 --> 18:19.088
Where's the rest of the senate?

18:19.139 --> 18:21.974
It's time the three of us
had a private conversation.

18:22.009 --> 18:25.227
Oh, this isn't about
more silly rumors, is it?

18:25.262 --> 18:28.381
You know I've never been a religious man,

18:28.415 --> 18:32.184
never believed in anything I
couldn't see with my own eyes.

18:32.186 --> 18:34.937
Then one day a being came down from the sky

18:34.988 --> 18:38.157
with wings on his back,
came to our defense,

18:38.191 --> 18:43.195
protected our city, told
us he'd saved a baby,

18:43.246 --> 18:45.197
and that baby would one day save us all.

18:45.248 --> 18:48.834
That hope is what got us through the war,

18:48.869 --> 18:51.120
what gets me through every day,

18:51.171 --> 18:56.759
what gives so many people in
this city something to live for.

18:59.513 --> 19:01.263
I'm sorry to disappoint you, Thomas,

19:01.298 --> 19:02.431
but we're the only ones here.

19:02.466 --> 19:04.050
Don't lie to me, Edward.

19:04.052 --> 19:05.801
I know that the chosen one's here

19:05.852 --> 19:08.120
and that you're hiding him because you know

19:08.155 --> 19:11.457
that once the people have their Savior,

19:11.491 --> 19:13.959
your power means nothing.

19:13.994 --> 19:15.227
Oh, Frost, come on.

19:15.278 --> 19:16.729
Haven't we been through this?

19:16.731 --> 19:18.481
Don't patronize me, David.

19:18.532 --> 19:22.651
A little girl in the
infirmary told his daughter

19:22.703 --> 19:25.121
that the chosen one had been arrested.

19:25.155 --> 19:29.792
And Claire Riesen seemed
to know exactly who he was.

19:29.826 --> 19:31.744
What's that in your hand?

19:31.795 --> 19:34.580
This is a wireless control unit.

19:34.582 --> 19:39.335
It has a biometric lock that
responds only to my thumbprint.

19:39.386 --> 19:41.587
Covers the entire tower.

19:41.589 --> 19:44.757
I can lock all the doors,

19:44.808 --> 19:47.093
open the irrigation tanks,

19:47.127 --> 19:49.328
all of them,

19:49.363 --> 19:52.598
600,000 gallons of water

19:52.649 --> 19:55.601
rushing into the tower all at once.

19:55.603 --> 19:58.187
We'll drown.

19:58.238 --> 20:00.856
All the crops will be destroyed.

20:00.907 --> 20:02.742
The people of Vega will starve.

20:02.776 --> 20:05.244
What is it you want?

20:08.031 --> 20:12.501
I want to meet the chosen one.

20:18.098 --> 20:19.765
Wait, she asked you to go back to Helena?

20:19.800 --> 20:21.600
Um, not in so many words.

20:21.602 --> 20:23.319
Word of advice, run.

20:23.353 --> 20:24.687
Ethan.

20:24.738 --> 20:28.524
The woman had a body in a
box delivered to her doorstep.

20:28.575 --> 20:30.042
Don't worry about me.

20:30.077 --> 20:33.579
Yeah, I'm sure that's what
the woman in the box said.

20:33.613 --> 20:35.364
You know what I think?

20:35.415 --> 20:37.783
I think a strong, regal
woman like Madam Arika,

20:37.785 --> 20:39.952
I think she threatens you.

20:39.954 --> 20:41.036
Huh?

20:41.088 --> 20:42.588
I think you're right.

20:42.622 --> 20:45.541
Besides, what good am I
really doing here anyways?

20:45.592 --> 20:48.794
Noma, you saved my ass at least once.

20:48.845 --> 20:50.629
Lannon, where you been, bro?

20:50.631 --> 20:52.548
Been looking all over for you.

20:52.599 --> 20:54.884
Took a drive. Needed to clear my head.

20:54.935 --> 20:58.020
I get it.

20:58.054 --> 21:00.272
Uh, I don't.

21:00.307 --> 21:03.392
What's going on, guys?

21:03.443 --> 21:07.279
- It's nothing.
- It's nothing.

21:07.314 --> 21:10.816
You go outside the walls,
disappear for an entire day

21:10.818 --> 21:12.735
to clear your head,

21:12.786 --> 21:14.036
and you're all, "I get it."

21:14.070 --> 21:16.956
Guys, come on, that's not nothing.

21:21.995 --> 21:24.713
Ethan, I've been seeing Claire Riesen.

21:28.885 --> 21:32.054
As in the same Claire Riesen
whose father orders executions?

21:32.088 --> 21:33.339
All right, let's saddle up.

21:33.390 --> 21:36.392
Hostage situation at the
agri-tower in progress.

21:36.426 --> 21:37.726
Prep for a raid.

21:37.761 --> 21:39.061
We're up in five.

21:39.095 --> 21:40.479
What's going on, Lieutenant?

21:40.514 --> 21:42.681
Our entire food supply is
at risk of being destroyed,

21:42.683 --> 21:45.401
as well as the lives of the
general and Consul Whele.

21:45.435 --> 21:48.687
Look alive, troops.

21:48.689 --> 21:51.190
We can't simply walk in
there and start shooting.

21:51.241 --> 21:53.275
We need an executive order from Riesen.

21:53.326 --> 21:54.443
Well, he's not here.

21:54.494 --> 21:56.278
The message Frost sent us made it clear

21:56.329 --> 21:58.030
that all security
systems in the agri-tower

21:58.081 --> 21:59.248
have been placed on lockdown.

21:59.282 --> 22:01.116
So call in the engineer and unlock them.

22:01.168 --> 22:02.535
Frost is that engineer.

22:02.537 --> 22:05.588
Our grains are in that tower.
The food supply is at risk.

22:05.622 --> 22:07.206
We have no choice but to use force.

22:07.257 --> 22:08.374
Don't you see that?

22:08.425 --> 22:11.427
[Overlapping chatter]

22:11.461 --> 22:13.796
Becca, I got your message.

22:13.847 --> 22:15.097
Is my father okay?

22:15.131 --> 22:18.551
He's fine, Claire.

22:18.602 --> 22:21.554
By the power vested in me as Second Consul,

22:21.605 --> 22:23.722
I appoint you Lady of the City Pro Tem.

22:23.724 --> 22:26.225
Oh.

22:26.276 --> 22:28.694
Please take a seat.

22:28.728 --> 22:31.397
[All murmuring]

22:47.247 --> 22:48.747
[Indistinct chatter]

22:48.749 --> 22:51.050
So what are we doing? What's our response?

22:51.084 --> 22:52.418
The corps are in a holding pattern,

22:52.469 --> 22:54.920
awaiting our decision to enter
and liberate the hostages.

22:54.971 --> 22:56.422
What are Senator Frost's demands?

22:56.424 --> 22:57.756
He's gonna flood the tower,

22:57.807 --> 23:00.226
unless he's given an
audience with the chosen one.

23:00.260 --> 23:01.310
What?

23:01.344 --> 23:03.229
Let's vote on sending the corps in.

23:03.263 --> 23:04.480
All: Yes.

23:04.514 --> 23:06.649
No. Wait.

23:06.683 --> 23:08.817
Before we vote, I'd like a moment to confer

23:08.852 --> 23:11.103
with my consuls.

23:12.405 --> 23:15.407
Frost, if you know me at all,

23:15.442 --> 23:18.911
you know the food supply for
this city is not negotiable.

23:18.945 --> 23:21.947
Oh, I do know you.

23:21.949 --> 23:24.533
I know both of you.

23:24.584 --> 23:26.752
And I can't allow a few politicians

23:26.786 --> 23:29.788
to control the destiny
of the entire human race

23:29.790 --> 23:32.541
just because they feel their
grip on power is threatened.

23:32.592 --> 23:35.261
Why would we be threatened by a myth?

23:35.295 --> 23:38.130
Why would Gabriel attack
Vega after ten years of peace?

23:38.132 --> 23:43.302
Look, I know what it's like to
believe something so strongly

23:43.353 --> 23:45.471
that you're... you're blinded, Thomas.

23:45.473 --> 23:47.556
It blinds you to the simple fact

23:47.607 --> 23:50.859
that your faith is nothing but a crutch.

23:50.894 --> 23:55.064
It's a band-aid for your own fears.

23:55.115 --> 24:00.653
Belief in something doesn't make
it real, nor will it save you.

24:00.655 --> 24:02.821
My faith is made of stronger stuff

24:02.823 --> 24:06.125
than dime-store televangelism, David.

24:06.159 --> 24:09.495
I know that he will save the human race

24:09.546 --> 24:11.880
and that he will lead us
against these monsters.

24:11.915 --> 24:14.333
These monsters you're talking about,

24:14.335 --> 24:17.169
they haunt my dreams to this day.

24:17.171 --> 24:22.508
I... I try to make sense of it,
but for the life of me, I can't.

24:22.559 --> 24:24.977
But after all my long nights,

24:25.011 --> 24:28.847
after all my heartache,

24:28.898 --> 24:32.184
you know what I came to realize?

24:32.235 --> 24:36.188
The chosen one, it's us.

24:36.190 --> 24:37.489
It's the people of Vega.

24:37.524 --> 24:40.693
That's what's gonna save us.

24:40.695 --> 24:44.446
I wish that were true.

24:44.497 --> 24:47.249
You have 30 minutes to bring him to me.

24:47.283 --> 24:48.667
You know how much I respect you,

24:48.702 --> 24:51.086
but stalling any longer is gonna
get both our fathers killed.

24:51.121 --> 24:53.038
William, raiding the tower

24:53.040 --> 24:54.623
will scare Frost into releasing the water.

24:54.674 --> 24:56.759
The only alternative is
to give him what he wants.

24:56.793 --> 24:58.961
Yes.

24:59.012 --> 25:03.799
Would that be such a bad thing?

25:03.850 --> 25:06.135
I think the people of Vega deserve to know

25:06.186 --> 25:07.386
he's finally arrived.

25:07.388 --> 25:09.722
Claire, I share your faith, I do,

25:09.724 --> 25:12.274
but Alex's safety is far more important.

25:12.308 --> 25:14.977
What if things go sideways
and Frost pulls the trigger?

25:15.028 --> 25:17.229
He'll kill both our fathers and
the chosen one in the process.

25:17.280 --> 25:18.530
What then?

25:18.565 --> 25:20.566
Right now, we need to vote
on sending in the corps.

25:20.617 --> 25:22.034
It's our only option.

25:22.068 --> 25:27.706
They can be there in 15 minutes.

25:27.741 --> 25:30.325
Fine.

25:30.377 --> 25:33.462
Fine.

25:33.496 --> 25:37.966
I give you permission to
cast my vote with yours.

25:38.001 --> 25:40.252
Excuse me.

25:40.254 --> 25:43.972
Claire, where are you going?

25:44.007 --> 25:47.426
We have to vote.

25:47.428 --> 25:50.229
It's always been like
this with the two of you,

25:50.263 --> 25:54.400
fighting over a world that
was never even created for us.

25:54.434 --> 25:59.405
How could Father just desert us like this?

25:59.439 --> 26:02.408
Uriel, be patient.

26:02.442 --> 26:04.109
He will return.

26:04.111 --> 26:05.911
How do you know?

26:05.945 --> 26:08.030
I know.

26:12.419 --> 26:14.420
I miss him.

26:21.511 --> 26:25.013
Sister.

26:25.048 --> 26:27.599
Train your chosen one.

26:27.634 --> 26:32.137
Unlock the markings and
help him fulfill his destiny,

26:32.188 --> 26:37.142
and I promise, you
won't face Gabriel alone.

26:37.193 --> 26:40.479
You'll have my sword.

26:40.530 --> 26:41.980
Thank you.

26:42.031 --> 26:44.983
Don't thank me.

26:46.986 --> 26:50.989
They were once Father's greatest creation.

26:56.463 --> 26:57.880
Odds are the senate is authorizing

26:57.914 --> 26:59.331
an armed assault as we speak.

26:59.382 --> 27:02.885
What, risk both of us and the tomatoes?

27:02.919 --> 27:04.386
Come on, Edward, you know Thorn

27:04.420 --> 27:05.504
needs the kids to pass that vote,

27:05.555 --> 27:08.841
and we both know they
are not up to the task.

27:08.843 --> 27:11.844
It's all because of that
V-1 runt your daughter took

27:11.895 --> 27:13.929
under her wing.

27:13.980 --> 27:18.934
I should have dealt with her
when I dealt with those techs.

27:21.988 --> 27:24.656
Look,

27:24.691 --> 27:27.359
Thomas,

27:27.410 --> 27:32.781
despite all the unkind
things I've said about you

27:32.832 --> 27:37.035
behind closed doors... in
front of them as well...

27:37.086 --> 27:40.956
up until this afternoon,

27:41.007 --> 27:44.209
I've always known you
to be a reasonable man.

27:49.516 --> 27:53.185
Look what you're doing here.

27:53.219 --> 27:54.353
Come on. Let's be reasonable.

27:54.387 --> 27:55.888
Open the doors. [Gunshot]

27:55.939 --> 27:57.389
[Screams]

27:57.440 --> 28:00.726
I am tired of being reasonable, David.

28:00.728 --> 28:02.778
[Groans]

28:06.830 --> 28:07.997
Go, go, go!

28:07.999 --> 28:10.500
Go, go, go, go, go!

28:17.508 --> 28:18.758
We have confirmation.

28:18.809 --> 28:20.476
Consul Whele is down.

28:20.511 --> 28:22.512
Prepare to move.

28:22.563 --> 28:24.147
I don't get it. Last time
I was on Frost detail,

28:24.181 --> 28:26.316
the guy spent all his free time baking.

28:26.350 --> 28:28.568
I got to say, his butterscotch brownies,

28:28.602 --> 28:29.569
pretty damn good.

28:29.603 --> 28:32.155
This is a hostage situation.

28:32.189 --> 28:33.690
Frost must want something.

28:33.741 --> 28:35.608
What aren't they telling us?

28:35.659 --> 28:37.327
Yeah, apparently, the senator's demanding

28:37.361 --> 28:38.995
to see the chosen one.

28:39.029 --> 28:39.996
What?

28:40.030 --> 28:41.581
Yeah. Crazy, huh?

28:41.615 --> 28:42.865
The guy's totally lost it.

28:42.916 --> 28:46.285
[Men shouting in background]

28:46.337 --> 28:47.620
Cheer up, man.

28:47.671 --> 28:52.008
You know we don't get to
do shit like this anymore.

28:59.266 --> 29:01.968
Looks like it missed the artery.

29:02.019 --> 29:04.804
You're gonna live.

29:04.855 --> 29:09.475
Sorry to disappoint you.

29:09.526 --> 29:11.361
[Grunts]

29:12.730 --> 29:15.815
[Exhales]

29:15.866 --> 29:18.901
I am the one who just got shot.

29:18.903 --> 29:23.573
How come you look like
you're gonna drop dead?

29:23.575 --> 29:24.707
Your heart, huh?

29:24.742 --> 29:25.908
My heart is fine.

29:25.910 --> 29:28.244
What are you taking for it?

29:28.246 --> 29:29.912
Pills, for what they're damn worth.

29:29.963 --> 29:32.882
What kind of pills?

29:32.916 --> 29:34.167
If I could pronounce the name,

29:34.218 --> 29:36.302
don't you think I would
have damn well said it?

29:36.336 --> 29:38.221
[Laughs]

29:38.255 --> 29:41.808
You know, between the two of us,

29:41.842 --> 29:47.597
we've probably beaten
death a hundred times,

29:47.648 --> 29:50.433
we've resisted the possessions,

29:50.435 --> 29:55.438
fought off how many black-eyed beasts,

29:55.440 --> 29:59.859
and now it'll probably come to an end

29:59.910 --> 30:04.664
at the hands of Thomas Frost.

30:04.698 --> 30:09.502
Crazy son of a bitch.

30:09.536 --> 30:12.789
I wish I could say he was crazy.

30:12.791 --> 30:15.258
Mack, Lannon, Banks, take forward position.

30:15.292 --> 30:16.426
- Yes, sir.
- Sir.

30:16.460 --> 30:17.427
Gomez, Rogers, O'Neill, take flank.

30:17.461 --> 30:18.628
- Sir.
- Yes, sir.

30:18.630 --> 30:20.096
You're authorized to terminate the target.

30:20.130 --> 30:22.298
Sir, what about collateral damage, sir?

30:22.300 --> 30:25.384
- The crops are our priority.
- Wait.

30:25.436 --> 30:26.385
- You heard the order.
- Lieutenant.

30:26.437 --> 30:28.304
Lieutenant.

30:28.355 --> 30:32.692
Lieutenant, let me go in.

30:32.726 --> 30:34.477
Get the hell back in line
before I kick your ass.

30:34.528 --> 30:38.231
He has my approval.

30:40.868 --> 30:43.119
Sergeant Lannon can negotiate.

30:43.153 --> 30:45.655
Ms. Riesen, with all respect,

30:45.657 --> 30:49.292
I have the orders from the senate.

30:49.326 --> 30:52.328
I'm acting Lady of the City.

30:52.330 --> 30:54.580
This is an executive order.

30:57.468 --> 31:00.002
You and your negotiator have five minutes.

31:00.004 --> 31:03.172
All points, hold position.

31:08.428 --> 31:10.012
They're getting Lannon to do the talking?

31:10.063 --> 31:11.314
I'm the talker.

31:11.348 --> 31:15.852
Senator Frost, we are
complying with your request.

31:15.903 --> 31:19.939
Please back away from the door.

31:19.990 --> 31:22.658
Only one person comes in.

31:22.693 --> 31:25.528
Only one man.

31:27.865 --> 31:31.534
[Overlapping shouting]

31:36.507 --> 31:39.792
I'm the one you want to see.

31:44.431 --> 31:47.133
I'm the chosen one.

31:47.184 --> 31:50.019
Is this some kind of joke?

31:50.053 --> 31:53.055
I'm afraid not, sir.

31:53.057 --> 31:57.727
Please, let the general and the consul go,

31:57.729 --> 32:00.062
and we'll talk.

32:00.064 --> 32:02.114
You're a V-2.

32:02.149 --> 32:03.733
I've seen you guarding House Riesen.

32:03.784 --> 32:06.953
What did they do, paint
those things on you?

32:06.987 --> 32:09.038
What the hell do you take me for, Edward?

32:09.072 --> 32:12.742
Just take it easy, Frost.

32:12.793 --> 32:14.327
Come on, Frost. [Beeping]

32:14.378 --> 32:17.330
This is what you wanted.

32:22.336 --> 32:25.504
Sir, please. Please.

32:25.556 --> 32:27.089
I swear.

32:27.091 --> 32:29.058
I'm the one.

32:29.092 --> 32:30.343
I'm the baby Michael saved.

32:30.394 --> 32:32.228
Prove it.

32:41.694 --> 32:42.894
_

32:43.023 --> 32:46.108
She died for you.

32:50.113 --> 32:52.582
What did you say?

32:57.004 --> 32:59.422
She died for you.

33:02.626 --> 33:04.961
Yes, she did.

33:08.131 --> 33:13.436
My Daughter Abby, she died for me.

33:18.108 --> 33:20.526
It was the first night of the war,

33:20.560 --> 33:25.865
and because of Abby, I was able to survive.

33:25.899 --> 33:30.620
Please, Senator, turn off the water.

33:30.654 --> 33:33.289
You can change things.

33:33.323 --> 33:38.744
Now we are gonna go outside
and let the people know

33:38.795 --> 33:41.547
that things are gonna be different now.

33:41.581 --> 33:42.548
We will.

33:42.582 --> 33:44.967
We'll tell everyone.

33:45.002 --> 33:48.671
We'll tell them together.

33:48.722 --> 33:52.341
Please, just turn it off.

34:03.603 --> 34:06.188
Thank you, Savior.

34:09.525 --> 34:11.827
Thank you.

34:19.870 --> 34:23.706
[Gunshot]

34:23.757 --> 34:26.708
What did you do that for?

34:26.710 --> 34:28.928
Put your shirt on.

34:31.914 --> 34:33.748
These should help with the pain,

34:33.782 --> 34:37.301
but you've got to stay off your feet.

34:37.335 --> 34:39.920
Thank you.

34:41.924 --> 34:44.926
You shouldn't be drinking.

34:44.976 --> 34:47.261
And you shouldn't have sent
the corps into the agri-tower.

34:47.312 --> 34:49.514
A remarkably poor decision even for you.

34:49.565 --> 34:51.482
I did what's best for the city.

34:51.516 --> 34:54.851
No, Claire did that by
sending in the only man capable

34:54.902 --> 34:55.987
of defusing the situation.

34:56.021 --> 34:59.073
You, you let your faith interfere.

34:59.108 --> 35:01.325
You put the life of
your precious chosen one

35:01.360 --> 35:04.529
before the city, before your own father.

35:04.580 --> 35:06.497
Alex Lannon,

35:06.532 --> 35:08.282
he's the one destined to save mankind,

35:08.284 --> 35:10.501
not two old men past their prime.

35:14.423 --> 35:16.340
Have fun.

35:16.375 --> 35:19.377
Praise the Mother of All.

35:19.428 --> 35:22.130
David, you could have been killed.

35:22.181 --> 35:26.801
Forgive me if I'm not really in the mood.

35:26.803 --> 35:28.219
You're burning up.

35:28.270 --> 35:30.555
There's a Helenic remedy
that'll take the fever down.

35:30.606 --> 35:32.306
I'll have a guard fetch the ingredients.

35:32.357 --> 35:35.810
I'll stick to bourbon.

35:47.122 --> 35:48.322
Wow.

35:48.324 --> 35:53.211
This is the last place
I thought I'd find you.

35:53.245 --> 35:56.798
20 years Frost served Vega,

35:56.832 --> 35:58.549
one of the city's founding fathers,

35:58.584 --> 36:00.218
and now he'll be remembered as a madman.

36:00.252 --> 36:02.336
Mm-mm.

36:02.387 --> 36:07.008
My father has become an
expert at rewriting history.

36:07.059 --> 36:10.178
Frost is gonna get a state funeral.

36:10.180 --> 36:13.397
He's gonna be remembered as a hero,

36:13.432 --> 36:18.519
a hero who saved the agri-towers
from an accidental flood

36:18.570 --> 36:21.489
at the cost of his own life.

36:21.523 --> 36:23.908
He didn't die for nothing.

36:29.448 --> 36:31.332
You came forward, Alex.

36:31.366 --> 36:33.000
I had to.

36:33.035 --> 36:37.588
People's lives were at stake.

36:37.623 --> 36:41.425
But when I was in there,

36:41.460 --> 36:46.464
these words came to me through my markings.

36:49.718 --> 36:53.604
Those words made Frost believe in me.

36:56.191 --> 36:58.226
Maybe Frost was right.

36:58.277 --> 37:00.695
Maybe the people do
deserve to know about you.

37:00.729 --> 37:04.732
I don't know what I'm doing, Claire.

37:04.783 --> 37:08.236
I got lucky this time, but I...

37:08.287 --> 37:09.570
I don't know what any of this means.

37:09.572 --> 37:12.406
So maybe it's time you
start figuring it out.

37:18.714 --> 37:20.748
I'll leave you to it.

37:24.336 --> 37:26.754
Where have you been?

37:26.756 --> 37:29.807
Family emergency.

37:29.841 --> 37:31.726
Yeah, I had an emergency of my own.

37:31.760 --> 37:32.927
I could have used your help.

37:32.978 --> 37:34.845
Alex, I can help you.

37:34.897 --> 37:37.899
I can teach you, but
only if you're willing.

37:40.936 --> 37:45.022
I want to learn...

37:45.073 --> 37:49.527
about everything.

37:49.777 --> 37:53.277
_

38:06.345 --> 38:09.297
What do you want?

38:09.348 --> 38:11.132
I don't want to fight.

38:11.183 --> 38:12.466
[Laughs]

38:12.517 --> 38:17.221
That's never what I
wanted with any of this.

38:17.272 --> 38:20.274
I thought I could fix things
between you and Michael,

38:20.309 --> 38:24.645
but I'm afraid Michael's lost his way.

38:24.647 --> 38:26.948
I've been telling you that for centuries.

38:26.982 --> 38:30.151
Well, now that the chosen one's here,

38:30.153 --> 38:33.487
I can't just sit back and do nothing.

38:33.489 --> 38:35.656
You say you can sway him,

38:35.707 --> 38:37.742
that he's fated to you and not our brother.

38:37.793 --> 38:39.293
As Father wanted it.

38:39.328 --> 38:41.912
Then prove it to me.

38:41.964 --> 38:47.501
Help him help the humans
to their own destruction,

38:47.552 --> 38:52.974
and I promise, you
won't face Michael alone.

38:53.008 --> 38:55.509
You will have my sword.

39:05.771 --> 39:09.073
Thank you, sister.

39:15.708 --> 39:18.710
[Monitor beeping steadily]
