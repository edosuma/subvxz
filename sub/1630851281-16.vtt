"The Rookie"...</i>

00:06.441 --> 00:07.964
That's Aaron Thorsen.

00:08.008 --> 00:09.661
Rich kid.
TikTok famous

00:09.705 --> 00:12.882
before he got arrested for
murdering his roommate in Paris.

00:12.925 --> 00:16.016
I was locked in a cell
for 541 days.

00:16.059 --> 00:18.409
The person who murdered Patrick,
he's still out there,

00:18.453 --> 00:20.237
and no one is looking for him

00:20.281 --> 00:21.673
because they still think
that I did it.

00:21.717 --> 00:23.675
I don't want to be a part of
this reality TV show.

00:23.719 --> 00:25.721
Sweetie, it's only
gonna help you.

00:25.764 --> 00:28.376
I'm Morris Mackey. I'm
the reality TV producer here.

00:28.419 --> 00:30.552
I just want to say,
this has been so fascinating.

00:30.595 --> 00:33.250
I love true crime,
and to be in a documentary,

00:33.294 --> 00:34.817
it's just --
it's a dream come true.

00:34.860 --> 00:35.818
Thank you.
Thank you.

00:39.126 --> 00:40.779
Nolan:
Do I just...?

00:41.824 --> 00:43.217
You're back.

00:43.260 --> 00:44.261
Interviewer:
Another crazy story --

00:44.305 --> 00:47.090
- how could I stay away?
- Thank you.

00:47.134 --> 00:48.700
- You good to go?
- Um, yeah.

00:48.744 --> 00:50.180
Where should I, uh --
where should I start?

00:50.224 --> 00:52.574
Why don't you, uh, tell me
about Aaron Thorsen?

00:52.617 --> 00:55.403
Well, Aaron came
to the F.T.O. program

00:55.446 --> 00:57.361
with the deck stacked
against him.

00:57.405 --> 01:00.408
He had to sue the LAPD
even to get into the Academy.

01:00.451 --> 01:02.410
I mean, you have to respect
just how hard he fought

01:02.453 --> 01:04.238
just to be here.

01:04.281 --> 01:08.198
Uh, but what happened in Paris
never left him,

01:08.242 --> 01:10.287
no matter how hard he tried
to move on.

01:10.331 --> 01:12.072
People would argue that doing
a reality show

01:12.115 --> 01:14.161
is the opposite
of moving on.

01:14.204 --> 01:15.988
Well, those people
haven't experienced

01:16.032 --> 01:17.903
what it's like
to be infamous.

01:17.947 --> 01:21.385
I mean, Aaron was desperate to
reset the way the world saw him.

01:21.429 --> 01:22.865
And it all blew up
in his face.

01:22.908 --> 01:25.389
Yeah.
Yeah, it really did.

01:35.921 --> 01:38.141
Aaron: I can't believe this
is happening to me again.

01:38.185 --> 01:39.447
Interviewer: It's nice
to see you again.

01:39.490 --> 01:40.578
Mm-hmm.

01:40.622 --> 01:42.450
And congratulations
on the baby.

01:42.493 --> 01:43.973
Thank you.

01:44.016 --> 01:45.496
Did being pregnant
make what you went through

01:45.540 --> 01:46.541
with Aaron
more stressful?

01:46.584 --> 01:47.977
Not here to talk about me.

01:48.020 --> 01:49.848
Fair enough. Uh,
let's talk about

01:49.892 --> 01:50.893
the reality show.

01:50.936 --> 01:53.200
Okay.
It was his mom's idea.

01:53.243 --> 01:55.724
It was a way to rebrand
his image.

01:55.767 --> 01:57.204
And what did you think
of the title?

01:58.509 --> 01:59.771
No comment.

01:59.815 --> 02:01.251
Seriously, though.
You have to have

02:01.295 --> 02:03.035
had an opinion --Listen, you're not
gonna get me

02:03.079 --> 02:05.821
to say that dumbass title,
so let's just move on.

02:32.413 --> 02:34.589
Yeah, so back there
is my parents' room

02:34.632 --> 02:35.981
and the family room.

02:36.025 --> 02:39.811
Um... Oh, right here,
this is my favorite photo.

02:39.855 --> 02:41.335
I was 6.

02:41.378 --> 02:42.945
And you might recognize
my dad.

02:42.988 --> 02:45.904
He was part of a '90s rap duo,
Flex n' Flow.

02:50.779 --> 02:52.041
Yeah, man, when I was a kid,
I used to love

02:52.084 --> 02:54.435
riding my tricycle up and down
this hallway.

02:54.478 --> 02:57.046
Until he knocked over my Music
Industry Achievement Award

02:57.089 --> 02:58.482
and broke it.

02:58.526 --> 03:00.397
Aaron tried to put it back
together with Play-Doh,

03:00.441 --> 03:02.443
thinking we wouldn't notice.

03:02.486 --> 03:06.011
But that's my son, always trying
to get away with something.

03:07.404 --> 03:08.753
Not anymore.

03:08.797 --> 03:11.756
I mean, now he's...
very responsible.

03:13.410 --> 03:15.586
Over here, we got
my childhood bedroom.

03:18.502 --> 03:21.026
What the hell?

03:21.070 --> 03:23.594
Hey, I never had
this picture of Patrick.

03:23.638 --> 03:24.943
Did you put this here?

03:24.987 --> 03:26.989
Morris: We just thought it'd be
a nice surprise.

03:27.032 --> 03:28.251
Man, Morris, what the hell
did I tell you, man,

03:28.295 --> 03:29.774
about faking stuff like this?

03:29.818 --> 03:31.907
Relax.
Uh, not a big deal.

03:31.950 --> 03:33.865
We just wanted to do it
for a take.

03:33.909 --> 03:34.779
Yeah, man,
that's not cool.

03:34.823 --> 03:35.824
You know what?
You're right.

03:35.867 --> 03:37.260
My bad.

03:37.304 --> 03:40.045
We'll -- We'll do it again,
but without the photo.

03:40.089 --> 03:41.351
Okay.

03:41.395 --> 03:43.135
Yeah, okay.

03:46.313 --> 03:47.966
Got that?

03:48.010 --> 03:50.012
Morris was white-hot
from doing

03:50.055 --> 03:52.057
several award-winning
documentaries in a row.

03:52.101 --> 03:54.146
The king of those
"30 Under 30" lists.

03:54.190 --> 03:56.236
He had a real gift
for earning people's trust,

03:56.279 --> 03:58.281
convincing them
that he was on their side,

03:58.325 --> 04:00.849
that they have a say
on the final cut.

04:00.892 --> 04:02.807
Then -- surprise --
they didn't.

04:05.941 --> 04:07.377
Hey.

04:07.421 --> 04:10.075
Sorry. I, uh, totally forgot
this was happening today.

04:10.119 --> 04:11.294
We just started.

04:11.338 --> 04:12.643
Uh, don't forget to tell him
about the, uh,

04:12.687 --> 04:13.688
forensics expert.

04:13.731 --> 04:14.950
I know.

04:14.993 --> 04:16.691
And the, uh --
the French prosecutor.

04:16.734 --> 04:17.953
I sent you that interview,
right?

04:17.996 --> 04:19.607
He was biased against Aaron
from the jump.

04:21.261 --> 04:23.306
I'm a decade older,

04:23.350 --> 04:25.221
but Aaron and I
had similar upbringings --

04:25.265 --> 04:27.223
rich parents,
private schools.

04:27.267 --> 04:29.617
I'm just lucky social media
didn't exist.

04:29.660 --> 04:31.227
Look, if I was
in Aaron's generation,

04:31.271 --> 04:33.490
I would have just as much
embarrassing footage as he did.

04:33.534 --> 04:36.493
Of what?
You studying tort reform at 15?

04:36.537 --> 04:38.452
I got into trouble.

04:38.495 --> 04:39.931
- Uh-huh.
- Okay.

04:39.975 --> 04:41.933
The point is, when you grow up
in this world,

04:41.977 --> 04:44.414
you don't hear "no" a lot,
which can make you a real ass--

04:44.458 --> 04:46.155
can make you
a very selfish person.

like, five pairs of these

04:50.768 --> 04:52.509

$30,000 a bottle,

05:19.057 --> 05:20.494
and he didn't drink a sip.

05:20.537 --> 05:22.887
That boy lost his mind.

05:22.931 --> 05:24.585
I had to get him out
of his comfort zone.

05:24.628 --> 05:26.848
I mean, I-I thought, you know,
a semester abroad

05:26.891 --> 05:28.371
would've helped him mature,

05:28.415 --> 05:30.721
so I sent him to Paris.

05:36.684 --> 05:38.642
<i>I was on scholarship.</i>

05:38.686 --> 05:40.035
University of Michigan.

05:40.078 --> 05:41.732
Go Wolverines.

05:41.776 --> 05:43.647

Can I please start over?

05:43.691 --> 05:46.128
Interviewer:
You're doing fine.

05:46.171 --> 05:47.999
Uh, when did you first meet
Aaron and Patrick?

05:48.043 --> 05:50.393
The program held a mixer
when we first arrived.

05:50.437 --> 05:52.526
It was mostly just a bunch of
awkward college students

05:52.569 --> 05:54.310
butchering French,

05:54.354 --> 05:56.834
but Aaron and Patrick were from
this whole other world.

05:56.878 --> 05:59.010
First impressions?

05:59.054 --> 06:03.188
I mean, honestly, they seemed
like entitled douchebags.

06:03.232 --> 06:04.364
But then I got to know them.

06:04.407 --> 06:06.278
You know,
it was like another planet --

06:06.322 --> 06:07.671
Planet Rich.

06:07.715 --> 06:09.151
Patrick was the funniest.

06:09.194 --> 06:11.283
All that stuff you saw
on Instagram,

06:11.327 --> 06:12.807
no, that's not who they were.

06:12.850 --> 06:14.852
Yeah, I mean, we went from
the Two Musketeers to Four,

06:14.896 --> 06:16.158
you know, just like that.

06:16.201 --> 06:18.160
Me, Patrick,
Rowan, and Everest,

06:18.203 --> 06:22.033
we were, uh, inseparable.

06:22.077 --> 06:24.296
And uh...

06:24.340 --> 06:26.473
Man, that feels like
so long ago.

06:26.516 --> 06:27.648
Are you nervous about
the reunion?

06:27.691 --> 06:28.866
A little.

06:28.910 --> 06:31.129
Or a lot.

06:31.173 --> 06:34.742
Yeah, I mean, um, I haven't seen
them since the trial.

06:34.785 --> 06:37.527
And they all went home,
graduated from college,

06:37.571 --> 06:39.660
got jobs, and...

06:39.703 --> 06:41.096
I went to prison.

06:41.139 --> 06:42.402
Do they believe
in your innocence?

06:42.445 --> 06:44.229
Yeah, 100%.

06:44.273 --> 06:45.361
They've both said that.

06:45.405 --> 06:46.623
You know, there can be
a big difference

06:46.667 --> 06:49.278
between what people say
and what they believe.

06:52.760 --> 06:53.978
Sorry. Let's --
Hold on.

06:54.022 --> 06:56.285
Let me reset that.

07:09.341 --> 07:10.560
Yeah.
You look so different.

07:10.604 --> 07:12.083
Yeah, I'm a little older.

07:12.127 --> 07:14.172
No, it's not that.
I don't know.

07:14.216 --> 07:15.565
You're like
a different guy.

07:15.609 --> 07:17.480
Something like that.

07:17.524 --> 07:18.916
I think I'm gonna cry. Hey.

07:18.960 --> 07:20.440
No, no, no crying.
You're gonna mess up my makeup.

07:20.483 --> 07:21.658
Oh!

07:21.702 --> 07:23.486
Oh, I'm sorry
I didn't come sooner.

07:23.530 --> 07:24.835
No, d-- don't worry about it, really.

07:24.879 --> 07:27.447
I'm just glad
to see you guys.

07:27.490 --> 07:29.187
Alright, so let's,
uh, get inside.

07:29.231 --> 07:31.451
I got food, drinks...

07:31.494 --> 07:34.018
cameras, and, uh...

07:34.062 --> 07:35.846
I'm sorry.
This is so weird.

07:35.890 --> 07:37.326
Hey, it's fine. We're just happy
to see you, bro.

07:38.458 --> 07:39.589
Yeah, me too. Yeah.

07:39.633 --> 07:41.243
Yeah. Alright.

my battery.

07:42.418 --> 07:43.854
Give me a second?

07:43.898 --> 07:45.508
Aaron: Okay.

07:53.342 --> 07:54.561
What the hell?

08:04.353 --> 08:05.876
Holy -

08:05.920 --> 08:07.530
Morris Mackey's throat
had been cut.

08:07.574 --> 08:08.923
By the time
his body was found,

08:08.966 --> 08:10.968
he'd been dead approximately
four hours.

08:11.012 --> 08:12.796
Interviewer: And who were
your initial suspects?

08:12.840 --> 08:14.319
Everyone who stepped foot
in the house that day.

08:14.363 --> 08:15.320
Including Aaron.

08:15.364 --> 08:16.931
Everyone.

08:16.974 --> 08:19.629
- Interviewer: Good morning.
- Good morning.

08:19.673 --> 08:20.412
It's nice to see you again.

08:20.456 --> 08:22.153
Nice to see you!

08:22.197 --> 08:23.154
I heard you were happy
with how

08:23.198 --> 08:24.373
the last documentary
came out.

08:24.416 --> 08:27.028
Oh, my God.
It was so good, and -- and --

08:27.071 --> 08:29.596
And I got so many compliments.

08:29.639 --> 08:32.729
Oh, that's great.
How about you?

08:32.773 --> 08:34.557
Didn't see it.
Can we get started?

08:34.601 --> 08:36.211
Uh, yeah.

08:36.254 --> 08:38.474
So, tell me what happened when
you arrived at the scene.

08:38.518 --> 08:39.562
We were
the first responders.

08:46.787 --> 08:47.962
Lucy: Whoa.

08:48.005 --> 08:48.963
Okay.

08:49.006 --> 08:51.182
It was a...frenetic day.

08:51.226 --> 08:55.578
So many people -- so --
so many personalities.

08:55.622 --> 08:58.015
But when you're talking
a star-studded crime scene

08:58.059 --> 09:01.410
with a witness list comprised
mostly of influencers,

09:01.453 --> 09:03.107
I guess that's
no surprise.

09:03.151 --> 09:04.631
Alright, look,
even with all those cameras

09:04.674 --> 09:07.111
and phones rolling in the house,
none of them caught anything

09:07.155 --> 09:08.809
even remotely helpful
to our investigation.

09:08.852 --> 09:10.332
Yeah. Luck?

09:10.375 --> 09:12.987
It just wasn't in our cards
that day.

09:14.554 --> 09:15.555
What?
Why are you so happy?

09:15.598 --> 09:18.035
I am being colorful.

09:18.079 --> 09:19.123
They will use more
of our coverage

09:19.167 --> 09:20.560
if we give them evocative
sound bites.

09:20.603 --> 09:21.952
I'm right, right?

09:21.996 --> 09:23.867
Can we get back
to the murder?

09:23.911 --> 09:26.174
I followed protocols.
You know, I -- I called it in,

09:26.217 --> 09:27.915
cleared the house,
did everything right.

09:27.958 --> 09:29.264
- Lucy: Mm-hmm.
- You believe me, right?

09:29.307 --> 09:30.744
O-Of course.

09:30.787 --> 09:32.484
I mean, but we have to
follow protocol, too.

09:32.528 --> 09:34.225
It's gonna be okay.

09:34.269 --> 09:35.879
I can't believe this
is happening to me again.

09:35.923 --> 09:37.054
I know.

09:38.360 --> 09:41.145
A-Are you okay?

09:41.189 --> 09:42.930
I think I'm having, like,
a panic attack.

09:42.973 --> 09:44.584
Oh, okay.
Uh, just sit down,

09:44.627 --> 09:45.715
and I'm gonna grab you
some water, okay?

09:45.759 --> 09:46.977
I'll be right back.

09:47.021 --> 09:48.675
Show's over.
Time to go.

09:48.718 --> 09:51.416
What? Uh, no, no, no.
No, it's not.

09:51.460 --> 09:53.462
This is my house,
my production.

09:53.505 --> 09:54.463
The show goes on.

09:54.506 --> 09:55.638
Connor, keep filming.

09:55.682 --> 09:56.683
Yeah, that's not
how this works.

09:56.726 --> 09:57.814
This is
my crime scene.

09:57.858 --> 10:00.425
Shut it off now.

10:00.469 --> 10:01.601
Shut it off!

10:03.864 --> 10:05.039
There was nothing
we could do.

10:05.082 --> 10:06.214
Tim:
Well, thanks for coming out.

10:06.257 --> 10:07.519
Yeah.

10:07.563 --> 10:09.870
Our paramedic crew was
short-staffed,

10:09.913 --> 10:13.264
and since we're all EMT-trained,
I was subbing in.

10:13.308 --> 10:14.309
Interviewer:
Oh, I don't understand.

10:14.352 --> 10:15.527
Why were you called in
at all?

10:15.571 --> 10:17.181
He was clearly dead,
right?

10:17.225 --> 10:19.575
You have no idea how many people
I see look that way

10:19.619 --> 10:21.185
and then spring back to life.

10:21.229 --> 10:22.796
Oh. Interesting.

10:22.839 --> 10:24.101
And what did you think
at the time?

10:24.145 --> 10:25.668
Did it seem to you
like Aaron did it?

10:25.712 --> 10:28.410
Of course not. He would never do
anything like that.

10:28.453 --> 10:30.586
Really? And you're confident
saying that --

10:30.630 --> 10:33.197
considering
your ex-husband?

10:33.241 --> 10:36.679
Wow. Okay.

10:36.723 --> 10:38.289
Ah, clearly,
you come prepared.

10:38.333 --> 10:43.207
Yeah, um, I --
I married a sociopath once.

10:43.251 --> 10:46.297
So maybe I'm not
the best judge of character.

10:46.341 --> 10:47.647
It's not about being
a good judge of character.

10:47.690 --> 10:49.126
We judge by the facts.

10:49.170 --> 10:50.693
Interviewer:
And what did the facts say?

10:50.737 --> 10:52.652
At first?

10:52.695 --> 10:53.914
Not much.

10:56.003 --> 10:57.744
How long you been here
filming today?

10:57.787 --> 10:59.441
About three
or four hours.

10:59.484 --> 11:00.616
After rehearsal
this morning,

11:00.660 --> 11:02.009
they had Everest and me
in the kitchen,

11:02.052 --> 11:03.532
getting our hair
and makeup done

11:03.575 --> 11:05.012
while they filmed
other stuff.

11:05.055 --> 11:06.491
Lucy: So you were in the kitchen
the whole time?

11:06.535 --> 11:10.234
Uh, well, I did sneak off
to crafty once or...

11:10.278 --> 11:11.714
four times.
I heard they had ice cream,

11:11.758 --> 11:12.976
and I've been dieting
like crazy

11:13.020 --> 11:14.238
'cause I was gonna be
on television,

11:14.282 --> 11:15.762
and I heard the camera
adds like 10 pounds.

11:15.805 --> 11:17.328
Is that true?

11:17.372 --> 11:18.982
Tim: So when was the last time
you saw Morris?

11:19.026 --> 11:20.810
Honestly, I ain't seen him
all day.

11:20.854 --> 11:22.116
I was dealing with work stuff

11:22.159 --> 11:23.900
right up
until we started filming.

11:23.944 --> 11:25.946
Lucy: And where were you
when Morris's body was found?

11:25.989 --> 11:27.904
In my office.

11:27.948 --> 11:29.079
And how would
you characterize

11:29.123 --> 11:31.342
Aaron's relationship
with Morris?

11:34.345 --> 11:35.956
It's important
you tell the truth.

11:38.175 --> 11:40.525
They didn't always agree about
the direction of the show.

11:40.569 --> 11:42.310
But my son,
he would never hurt anyone.

11:49.665 --> 11:52.450
Hey, do we really have
to do this in here?

11:52.494 --> 11:53.713
Yes, we do, son.

11:55.802 --> 11:58.718
Per government code 3300
and per Lybarger,

11:58.761 --> 12:01.198
I am required to advise
that you do <i>not</i> have

12:01.242 --> 12:02.852
the right
to remain silent.

12:02.896 --> 12:05.550
Anything you say can
and will be used against you.

12:05.594 --> 12:08.379
Refusal to fully
and completely answer

12:08.423 --> 12:11.078
all of Detective Lopez's
questions

12:11.121 --> 12:14.516
will result
in immediate termination.

12:14.559 --> 12:17.693
Do you understand?

12:17.737 --> 12:18.781
Yes, sir.

12:18.825 --> 12:20.087
And I'm here
to protect you

12:20.130 --> 12:21.828
as your union representative.

12:21.871 --> 12:23.612
This is your choice.

12:23.655 --> 12:25.570
But like
Sergeant Grey said,

12:25.614 --> 12:27.790
if you choose not to cooperate,
you will lose your job.

12:27.834 --> 12:28.965
Of course I'll cooperate.

12:31.272 --> 12:32.229
Good man.

12:34.492 --> 12:35.711
Alright.

12:35.755 --> 12:36.799
I'll leave you to it.

12:40.716 --> 12:41.848
I didn't kill Morris.

12:46.113 --> 12:49.986
When I saw him lying there,
like Patrick...

12:50.030 --> 12:51.379
Lopez: I understand.

12:51.422 --> 12:53.120
But it was common knowledge
that you and Morris

12:53.163 --> 12:54.730
weren't on
the best of terms.

12:54.774 --> 12:58.125
Who are you with? TMZ?

12:58.168 --> 12:59.735
You still feeding off my grief,
- you vultures?!
- Come on, guys.

12:59.779 --> 13:00.736
Morris,
- what are you doing, man?
- Get 'em out of here, man!

13:00.780 --> 13:02.738
Get out of here now!
Go!

13:02.782 --> 13:04.827
Yeah, what he did
to Patrick's dad

13:04.871 --> 13:08.570
was callous and exploitative,

13:08.613 --> 13:10.398
but I wouldn't kill him
for it.

13:10.441 --> 13:11.834
Harper: Yeah, that was bad.

13:11.878 --> 13:15.359
Aaron pulled over Patrick's dad
in a routine car stop.

13:15.403 --> 13:17.884
It was
a total random reunion,

13:17.927 --> 13:21.322
but Morris and his cameraman
were there filming,

13:21.365 --> 13:23.672
and that just made
everything worse.

13:23.715 --> 13:27.067
Dexter Hayes, he was a --
a grieving father, you know?

13:27.110 --> 13:31.027
And he -- he took a swing
at Officer Thorsen,

13:31.071 --> 13:32.159
so we had to book him,

13:32.202 --> 13:35.205
but we let him go
as soon as we could.

13:35.249 --> 13:37.599
And, you know, I thought
that would be the end of it.

13:37.642 --> 13:38.861
Interviewer: But you suspected
that Patrick's dad

13:38.905 --> 13:41.081
- could have killed Morris?
- We did.

13:41.124 --> 13:44.084
He was furious
about "Every Rose Has A --"

13:44.127 --> 13:46.347
about the reality show.

13:46.390 --> 13:49.916
And after years of the press
feeding off of his grief,

13:49.959 --> 13:52.832
yeah, it was believable
that he could've snapped.

13:52.875 --> 13:54.964
This is absurd.
You do know that?

13:55.008 --> 13:55.878
Tim: Alright, sir,
can you tell me where you were

13:55.922 --> 13:57.314
yesterday afternoon?

13:57.358 --> 13:59.882
I was in the office,
morning to midnight.

13:59.926 --> 14:01.884
Ask any one
of my employees.

14:01.928 --> 14:03.625
I didn't do this.

14:03.668 --> 14:05.627
Any idea who did?

14:05.670 --> 14:08.717
I can tell you that
whoever killed that man,

14:08.760 --> 14:11.851
his last name is Thorsen.

14:11.894 --> 14:14.679
I blame myself for ever letting
them into Patrick's life.

14:14.723 --> 14:16.029
They're a sick family.

14:16.072 --> 14:18.466
And Aaron is not
the only killer among them.

14:18.509 --> 14:19.771
Interviewer:
What did he mean by that?

14:19.815 --> 14:20.990
You know
what he meant by that.

14:21.034 --> 14:23.384
And we knew
from the reality show

14:23.427 --> 14:25.908
that Morris gave
Aaron's father a clear motive.

14:25.952 --> 14:28.563
And that's what I was thinking
for the opening theme.

14:28.606 --> 14:29.520
Yeah?
Yeah.

14:29.564 --> 14:30.260
I like it.

14:30.304 --> 14:31.827
You do?

14:31.871 --> 14:33.437
Almost as much
as I like you.

14:33.481 --> 14:34.961
Mm.

14:35.004 --> 14:36.919
You're so sweet.

14:36.963 --> 14:38.399
Oh.

14:38.442 --> 14:39.530
Lincoln: Hey!

14:39.574 --> 14:41.663
You hooking up
with my wife, man?!

14:41.706 --> 14:42.925
Linc,
it's not what you think.

14:42.969 --> 14:45.449
Boy, you better get
the hell up out of here!

14:48.191 --> 14:49.845
What the hell was that?!

14:49.889 --> 14:51.978
Are you seriously doing this
to me again?!

14:52.021 --> 14:53.457
In my own house!

14:53.501 --> 14:54.894
Interview: There's footage
of Lincoln catching

14:54.937 --> 14:56.765
Morris and Yvonne
in an intimate moment.

14:56.808 --> 14:58.941
That had to factor
into your investigation.

14:58.985 --> 15:01.248
Jealousy is
a primal motive.

15:01.291 --> 15:02.640
And some believe
that Lincoln had killed

15:02.684 --> 15:04.164
for jealousy
once before.

15:04.207 --> 15:06.470
He was a suspect in
a 20-year-old murder, wasn't he?

15:06.514 --> 15:07.471
Yes, he was.

15:13.869 --> 15:17.003
Interviewer: What can you
tell me about your father's
hip-hop duo, Flex n' Flow?

15:17.046 --> 15:17.960
I mean, I was, like, a baby,
you know,

15:18.004 --> 15:19.527
when they were
at their height.

15:19.570 --> 15:22.399
And, uh, that was the year
"Make Da Noise" went platinum.

15:22.443 --> 15:23.400
Interviewer: Flex n' Flow
had one of the most

15:23.444 --> 15:24.967
iconic singles
of the late '90s.

15:25.011 --> 15:26.360
Oh, my God.
"Make Da Noise"?

15:26.403 --> 15:29.450
That's like one
of my go-to karaoke jams.

16:02.657 --> 16:05.094
I was a Flow Girl.

16:05.138 --> 16:06.922
Wait. What?

16:06.966 --> 16:09.794
There was a scout who saw me
cheering in high school,

16:09.838 --> 16:11.492
and he asked me to audition.

16:11.535 --> 16:13.842
At first, I thought he was
just trying to get in my pants.

16:13.885 --> 16:19.108
But it turned out to be legit,
and it was for Flex n' Flow.

16:19.152 --> 16:21.154
I was the biggest fan.

16:21.197 --> 16:22.459
Interviewer: What are you
wearing, by the way?

16:22.503 --> 16:25.810
Oh, I teach capoeira
on Thursdays and Sundays.

16:25.854 --> 16:26.986
Oh.

16:27.029 --> 16:28.726
Did you ever see
Flex n' Flow argue

16:28.770 --> 16:29.640
while you were working
with them?

16:29.684 --> 16:32.339
Mm, I mean...well, sure,

16:32.382 --> 16:34.167
but nothing serious.

16:34.210 --> 16:36.082
They were like brothers,
and brothers fight.

16:36.125 --> 16:37.518
What do you say to the people
who are convinced

16:37.561 --> 16:39.389
that your husband
killed his late partner?

16:39.433 --> 16:42.392
Oh, honey, this alleged "feud"
between Linc and Calvin

16:42.436 --> 16:45.265
has gotten blown way out
of proportion over the years.

16:45.308 --> 16:47.223
But what about the night
of Calvin's murder?

16:47.267 --> 16:49.399
The infamous pre-release party
for "2 Hype Homies"?

16:49.443 --> 16:52.054
Did the party
get a little wild? Sure.

16:52.098 --> 16:54.274
Did the police come
and break it up? Mm-hmm.

16:54.317 --> 16:57.059
And did Linc and Calvin argue?
You bet.

16:57.103 --> 16:59.105
But they were just
passionate people.

16:59.148 --> 17:02.238
And nobody
ever threatened nobody.

17:02.282 --> 17:05.589
Yeah, they, uh --
they threatened each other.

17:05.633 --> 17:06.764
I was there.

17:06.808 --> 17:08.418
I was a rookie officer then.

17:08.462 --> 17:11.204
And my T.O. and I had got
a 415 call

17:11.247 --> 17:13.684
for an out-of-control party.

17:13.728 --> 17:17.558
It was a record release event
for Flex n' Flow.

17:17.601 --> 17:20.082
But anyway,
as we were breaking things up,

17:20.126 --> 17:22.432
I saw Flex n' Flow
in each other's faces.

17:22.476 --> 17:24.086
Interviewer: Could you hear
what they were fighting about?

17:24.130 --> 17:27.307
No. Um, as I approached,
their limousine was pulling up.

17:27.350 --> 17:29.178
But Flex -- um --

17:29.222 --> 17:31.833
um, I'm sorry, Lincoln --
was still very hot.

17:31.876 --> 17:36.533
He refused to get into the limo
with Flow, and, um...

17:36.577 --> 17:39.014
Yeah, he said
that he'd rather walk

17:39.058 --> 17:41.277
than to deal
with Flow's nonsense.

17:41.321 --> 17:42.539
Um...

17:42.583 --> 17:44.541
It was a good thing, too.

17:44.585 --> 17:46.804
Anchor: A devastating loss
for the music industry today,

17:46.848 --> 17:50.808
as Calvin Yard, one half
of the popular duo Flex n' Flow,

17:50.852 --> 17:53.159
was gunned down in Los Angeles
last night

17:53.202 --> 17:55.683
after leaving
his record launch party.

17:55.726 --> 17:57.598
It couldn't have been
more than five minutes later

17:57.641 --> 18:00.122
that we got
a shots-fired call.

18:00.166 --> 18:04.561
As Flow's limo was making
the turn on La Cienega,

18:04.605 --> 18:07.956
a car pulled alongside it
and unloaded 20 rounds

18:07.999 --> 18:09.436
at the rear of the vehicle.

18:10.915 --> 18:13.440
Um, Flow was shot
seven times.

18:14.919 --> 18:17.183
Yeah.

18:17.226 --> 18:19.402
That was my first homicide.

18:19.446 --> 18:20.925
I'll never forget it.

18:20.969 --> 18:22.840
It changes you.

18:22.884 --> 18:27.149
I did not have anything to do
with Calvin's death.

18:27.193 --> 18:28.629
Interviewer: But at the time of
his murder, all the talk was --

18:28.672 --> 18:29.934
That was garbage, man.

18:29.978 --> 18:31.153
All garbage.

18:31.197 --> 18:32.328
I loved Calvin
like a brother.

18:32.372 --> 18:34.330
You know, this --

18:34.374 --> 18:35.897
this is
straight-up exploitive.

18:35.940 --> 18:38.856
Calvin's murder was solved
decades ago, and you know it.

18:38.900 --> 18:42.295
A man named Gary Brown
was convicted of Flow's murder.

18:42.338 --> 18:44.775
It turns out Flow
was sleeping with Gary's wife.

18:44.819 --> 18:48.257
So as far as the LAPD
was concerned, case closed.

18:48.301 --> 18:50.651
Yeah, but the aura of guilt
haunted Lincoln's reputation

18:50.694 --> 18:52.783
like a dark shroud.

18:52.827 --> 18:53.915
I'm sorry.

18:53.958 --> 18:56.265
That was really good.

18:56.309 --> 18:58.180
Thanks.

18:58.224 --> 19:00.095
And with Lincoln alibi'd out,
you know,

19:00.139 --> 19:02.358
the investigation
focused on Yvonne.

19:02.402 --> 19:04.447
Mrs. Thorsen, how long
had you been having an affair

19:04.491 --> 19:05.361
with Morris Mackey?

19:05.405 --> 19:06.797
Please.

19:06.841 --> 19:08.451
I was not sleeping
with him.

19:08.495 --> 19:11.019
But the footage -- from
"Every Rose Has A Thorsen" --

19:11.062 --> 19:13.587
- we saw it.
- That was for the show.

19:13.630 --> 19:15.371
What, are you saying
you staged it?

19:15.415 --> 19:18.635
It's a reality show.
Of course we staged it.

19:18.679 --> 19:20.681
I can prove it.
I have the rest of the footage.

19:20.724 --> 19:22.900
Boy, you better get
the hell up out of here!

19:25.686 --> 19:27.122
What the hell was that?!

19:27.166 --> 19:29.472
Are you seriously doing this
to me again?!

19:29.516 --> 19:30.473
In my own house!

19:30.517 --> 19:32.823
You got some nerve!

19:32.867 --> 19:34.651
L-Let's talk about all the women
you slept with

19:34.695 --> 19:36.436
when you were F-Flex?

19:36.479 --> 19:38.438
Morris: Cut!

19:38.481 --> 19:40.440
Cut, cut, cut, cut.

19:40.483 --> 19:43.791
Linc, buddy,
you're going off-script.

19:43.834 --> 19:44.966
"I can't believe
you're seriously

19:45.009 --> 19:46.272
doing this to me <i>again"?</i>

19:46.315 --> 19:47.882
That's not the line.

19:47.925 --> 19:49.318
Yeah, man,
I was improv'ing a little.

19:49.362 --> 19:51.190
Yeah, maybe not do that,
okay?

19:51.233 --> 19:52.843
It's a lot more powerful
if this is the first time

19:52.887 --> 19:54.236
Yvonne has stepped out
on you.

19:54.280 --> 19:56.238
Okay.
So, Morris, how did I do?

19:56.282 --> 19:57.892
It was a bit big.

19:57.935 --> 19:59.807
Yeah, maybe, uh,
dial it back a hair.

19:59.850 --> 20:01.025
Let's go again.

20:01.069 --> 20:02.636
Man: <i>Back to one.</i>

20:02.679 --> 20:03.898
Go.

20:03.941 --> 20:04.986
We're making a show, people.

20:06.901 --> 20:09.556
None of that was in the footage
you turned over to us.

20:09.599 --> 20:11.210
Oops. My bad.

20:11.253 --> 20:13.516
We want everything --
now --

20:13.560 --> 20:15.518
or you'll be arrested
for obstruction.

20:15.562 --> 20:17.999
Ooh, that was good.

20:18.042 --> 20:20.001
Do you think I can get
a copy of that?

20:20.044 --> 20:22.003
That will play really well
in the show.

20:22.046 --> 20:23.700
Mrs. Thorsen,
this is serious.

20:23.744 --> 20:25.528
Morris Mackey was murdered
in your house.

20:25.572 --> 20:27.095
Your son
is still a suspect.

20:27.138 --> 20:29.140
Just like the police
to only focus

20:29.184 --> 20:31.273
on what's
in front of their nose.

20:31.317 --> 20:33.928
Morris Mackey didn't just appear
out of thin air

20:33.971 --> 20:35.408
when he started working
for me.

20:35.451 --> 20:37.975
Honey,
the man had enemies.

20:43.198 --> 20:44.634
They're the crazy ones!

20:44.678 --> 20:46.157
We're the sane ones!

20:46.201 --> 20:48.290
You're the cult!
You're sheep!

20:48.334 --> 20:50.423
Prior to working
with the Thorsen family,

20:50.466 --> 20:53.948
Morris had been hired by a bunch
of QAnon conspiracy theorists.

20:53.991 --> 20:55.950
Apparently, they didn't like
the negative publicity

20:55.993 --> 20:57.212
they were getting,

20:57.256 --> 20:59.258
and they wanted
to show their side.

20:59.301 --> 21:00.476
Try to control
the narrative.

21:00.520 --> 21:01.738
- Mm.
- Interviewer: So what happened?

21:01.782 --> 21:03.697
Morris was allowed
into the inner sanctum.

21:03.740 --> 21:06.439
Conducted dozens of interviews
with founders and followers.

21:06.482 --> 21:08.484
But he didn't make
a propaganda film,

21:08.528 --> 21:09.790
he told the truth.

21:09.833 --> 21:11.052
We're in a war.

21:11.095 --> 21:12.793
Every one of us is prepared
to start killing

21:12.836 --> 21:13.968
for our freedom.

21:14.011 --> 21:15.143
Morris may have won
an Emmy,

21:15.186 --> 21:16.797
but he also pissed off
a lot of unhinged

21:16.840 --> 21:18.538
and hyper-violent people.

21:18.581 --> 21:20.148
The storm is coming.

21:20.191 --> 21:20.801
There will be retribution.

21:25.066 --> 21:28.504
Interviewer: I've heard rumors
that you have insight into
the QAnon angle on this case.

21:28.548 --> 21:30.637
Have you ever tried to put
toothpaste back in the tube?

21:30.680 --> 21:32.726
Look, I know
it's an expression,

21:32.769 --> 21:35.206
but have you actually tried
to do it?

21:35.250 --> 21:36.773
I have.

21:36.817 --> 21:38.601
It's basically impossible.

21:38.645 --> 21:40.342
And what do you think Q
is trying to tell people

21:40.386 --> 21:43.084
with his Q-Drops,
these cryptic messages?

21:43.127 --> 21:44.651
I really wasn't trying
to say anything.

21:44.694 --> 21:47.610
I was just typing, and maybe
I got a little carried away.

21:47.654 --> 21:49.177
Wait.
What did you say?

21:50.657 --> 21:54.008
Well, I guess now is as good
a time as any to reveal it.

21:56.402 --> 21:58.099
I'm Q.

21:58.142 --> 21:59.448
Smitty is Q?

21:59.492 --> 22:00.449
I'm sorry. What?

22:00.493 --> 22:02.059
- Lord, give me strength.
- What?

22:02.103 --> 22:04.627
A lot of writers
use pseudonyms.

22:04.671 --> 22:07.326
Q is my first initial, so...

22:07.369 --> 22:08.762
Hey, is my name down there?

22:10.938 --> 22:11.982
But it was an accident?

22:12.026 --> 22:14.376
He -- He didn't start it
on purpose?

22:14.420 --> 22:15.508
Interviewer:
That's what he said.

22:15.551 --> 22:16.987
Yeah,
sounds like Smitty.

22:17.031 --> 22:19.120
I was trying to start
the fan-fiction club

22:19.163 --> 22:21.731
for "This Is Us,"
and things just got out of hand.

22:21.775 --> 22:23.342
Interviewer: What the hell
does "This is Us" fanfic

22:23.385 --> 22:24.691
have to do with a cult?

22:24.734 --> 22:27.824
I mistakenly mixed cough syrup
with diet pills

22:27.868 --> 22:30.479
when I was writing
this satanic, alien story line

22:30.523 --> 22:32.612
for Jack and Rebecca.

22:32.655 --> 22:35.397
I woke up the next morning
and read it --

22:35.441 --> 22:36.746
none of it made sense.

22:36.790 --> 22:39.053
But, overnight,
I'd gotten so many followers,

22:39.096 --> 22:40.359
I just went with it.

22:40.402 --> 22:42.839
You can't put the toothpaste
back in the tube.

22:44.450 --> 22:48.149
Morris had received threats from
hundreds of QAnon followers,

22:48.192 --> 22:50.630
but when we started
investigating them,

22:50.673 --> 22:52.675
one immediately stood out.

22:52.719 --> 22:53.981
Interviewer: Tell me
about Connor Hart.

22:54.024 --> 22:55.461
What about him
got your attention?

22:55.504 --> 22:58.159
Well, he was working as a
cameraman on the reality show,

22:58.202 --> 23:00.422
so -- that.

23:01.597 --> 23:04.121
Tim: Connor,
thanks for coming down.

23:04.165 --> 23:05.514
I'm not in trouble, am I?

23:05.558 --> 23:08.604
No. We just need to clear
a few things up.

23:08.648 --> 23:10.998
I told you
everything I know.

23:11.041 --> 23:14.131
I was getting a battery,
and he was just lying there.

23:14.175 --> 23:15.655
I'm not sure
if you're aware,

23:15.698 --> 23:18.179
but it's common to run
background checks on witnesses.

23:18.222 --> 23:19.920
And when we looked into you,
we discovered

23:19.963 --> 23:21.182
that you're a member
of QAnon.

23:21.225 --> 23:22.836
No, no, no, I --

23:22.879 --> 23:24.838
I may have gone
to a political rally or two,

23:24.881 --> 23:26.230
but I'm really
not into that.

23:26.274 --> 23:27.971
I swear.

23:28.015 --> 23:29.625
We're in a war.

23:29.669 --> 23:32.498
Every one of us is prepared to
start killing for our freedom.

23:32.541 --> 23:34.064
The storm is coming.

23:34.108 --> 23:35.501
There will be retribution.

23:41.071 --> 23:43.639
So, clearly,
you are a follower of Q.

23:43.683 --> 23:44.858
Why would you work
for Morris?

23:44.901 --> 23:46.468
Honestly?

23:46.512 --> 23:47.904
I realized
Morris was the best thing

23:47.948 --> 23:49.645
that could have happened
to the movement.

23:49.689 --> 23:50.864
That makes no sense.

23:50.907 --> 23:52.692
But it does.

23:52.735 --> 23:55.477
Morris's documentary exposed
who was a true believer.

23:55.521 --> 23:57.784
And who wasn't.

23:57.827 --> 24:00.047
He never admitted it,

24:00.090 --> 24:03.137
but I think Morris
was working for Q.

24:03.180 --> 24:05.008
That's why I followed him
to the next gig.

24:05.052 --> 24:07.184
Do you still consider yourself
a believer of Q?

24:07.228 --> 24:10.318
Well, some stuff
didn't come true.

24:10.361 --> 24:12.451
The London bombing,
the Pope's arrest,

24:12.494 --> 24:13.843
Zuckerberg still has a job.

24:13.887 --> 24:15.584
January 20th
came and went,

24:15.628 --> 24:17.717
March 4th came and went.

24:17.760 --> 24:20.502
I'm starting to think Kennedy
is still dead.

24:20.546 --> 24:21.634
Both of them.

24:21.677 --> 24:22.939
Mm.

24:22.983 --> 24:25.942
So you don't believe
in Q anymore?

24:25.986 --> 24:27.683
Oh, I believe every word.

24:27.727 --> 24:29.206
Connor was, um --

24:29.250 --> 24:31.078
Deranged?

24:31.121 --> 24:33.515
Let's say...
reality-challenged,

24:33.559 --> 24:35.299
which doesn't make him
a killer.

24:35.343 --> 24:38.085
No. And the fact that he had
a camera on his shoulder

24:38.128 --> 24:39.956
for the entire
murder window

24:40.000 --> 24:41.958
means that he couldn't
have killed Morris,

24:42.002 --> 24:44.091
so we were back
to square one.

24:44.134 --> 24:45.919
Interviewer: When the QAnon lead
didn't pan out,

24:45.962 --> 24:47.747
how did you pick up
the pieces of the case?

24:47.790 --> 24:50.489
We rolled up our sleeves
and put in the hours.

24:50.532 --> 24:52.012
We took on
the painstaking process

24:52.055 --> 24:54.754
of reviewing
every piece of video Morris shot

24:54.797 --> 24:56.233
in the weeks
before he died,

24:56.277 --> 25:00.237
including the footage
Yvonne "forgot" to give us.

25:00.281 --> 25:02.065
Until I found something
that changed everything.

25:04.633 --> 25:06.809
Lopez!

25:06.853 --> 25:08.376
Come look at this!

25:08.419 --> 25:10.073
So I immediately informed
Detective Lopez

25:10.117 --> 25:11.031
of what I discovered.

25:11.074 --> 25:11.814
Look what I just found.

25:11.858 --> 25:13.250
Wow.

25:13.294 --> 25:14.251
What?

25:14.295 --> 25:16.123
Look.

25:16.166 --> 25:17.820
Morris: Okay.

25:23.522 --> 25:26.176
I thought I knew everything
about Patrick's murder.

25:26.220 --> 25:28.483
I had done my homework.

25:28.527 --> 25:32.922
But the truth was hiding right
in front of me all this time.

25:32.966 --> 25:35.969
I know
who killed Patrick Hayes.

25:36.012 --> 25:37.144
And I can prove it. I --

25:40.103 --> 25:41.104
Uh, someone's here.

25:42.541 --> 25:43.716
More to follow.

25:43.759 --> 25:45.108
Nolan: That video
was recorded

25:45.152 --> 25:47.023
minutes before
Morris was murdered.

25:51.288 --> 25:53.726
Interviewer: I mean, Morris
claiming that he knew

25:53.769 --> 25:54.988
who the killer was
must've been energizing for you.

25:55.031 --> 25:55.989
Finally. A break
in your roommate's murder --

25:56.032 --> 25:58.339
No, he --
He wasn't my roommate.

25:58.382 --> 26:00.820
And I -- I hate when people
call him that --

26:00.863 --> 26:02.343
you know, like we found
each other

26:02.386 --> 26:04.737
on some French Craigslist
or something like that.

26:04.780 --> 26:06.086
Patrick was my best friend,

26:06.129 --> 26:07.566
from the time
that we were little kids.

26:07.609 --> 26:08.828
I mean, I was at his house
so often,

26:08.871 --> 26:10.656
his dad bought us
two of everything,

26:10.699 --> 26:11.961
you know, like siblings.

26:12.005 --> 26:13.746
Yeah,
Patrick was my brother.

26:13.789 --> 26:15.182
How did it feel to hear
that Morris thought

26:15.225 --> 26:17.053
he'd discovered
who killed Patrick?

26:17.097 --> 26:21.405
I mean, there had been
so many theories over the years.

26:21.449 --> 26:24.147
And so many people think
that they had it figured out.

26:24.191 --> 26:27.716
I -- I just never really
got my hopes up about it.

26:27.760 --> 26:29.500
This was different, though.
I mean, he made a break

26:29.544 --> 26:30.850
in the case
and died minutes later.

26:30.893 --> 26:32.765
You have to see
the connection.

26:32.808 --> 26:37.160
Well, uh, in the words
of Detective Harper --

26:37.204 --> 26:40.294
We look for facts,
not stories.

26:40.337 --> 26:41.991
Yeah, sure, but, I mean,
the timing --

26:42.035 --> 26:44.167
I mean, these murders
had to be related.

26:44.211 --> 26:46.648
Whoever killed Patrick
also killed Morris.

26:46.692 --> 26:47.910
Interviewer: Is it possible
Morris found out

26:47.954 --> 26:49.651
that Aaron was the killer
all along?

26:49.695 --> 26:51.174
Not a chance.
The Paris police

26:51.218 --> 26:54.700
never had a shred of evidence
against Aaron.

26:54.743 --> 26:56.397
They fumbled
the entire case.

26:56.440 --> 26:57.703
Right off the bat,
the paparazzi

26:57.746 --> 26:59.487
completely contaminated
the crime scene.

27:16.722 --> 27:18.811
Interviewer: But Aaron's DNA
was all over the murder weapon.

27:18.854 --> 27:20.421
You mean the knife
the killer pulled

27:20.464 --> 27:22.858
from the kitchen block
on Aaron and Patrick's counter?

27:22.902 --> 27:25.426
What -- What do you want to bet
that if we went to your house,

27:25.469 --> 27:27.602
we'd find your DNA
all over your stuff, too?

27:27.646 --> 27:29.909
I mean --

27:29.952 --> 27:31.345
Was that too mean?

27:31.388 --> 27:33.956
No, that actually
felt good.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.523
It was a dumb question.

27:35.566 --> 27:37.046
From the beginning,
the French police's case

27:37.090 --> 27:38.700
against Aaron
seemed flawed --

27:38.744 --> 27:40.702
Oh, yeah.
Their case was a mess --

27:40.746 --> 27:43.270
and their forensics
were compromised.

27:43.313 --> 27:45.707
I mean, the theory
that Aaron killed Patrick

27:45.751 --> 27:47.970
because he didn't do his share
of the chores never made sense.

27:48.014 --> 27:50.059
For one thing,
they had a housekeeper.

27:50.103 --> 27:51.626
For another,
Aaron is not a psychopath,

27:51.670 --> 27:53.454
which you would have to be
to stab your roommate

27:53.497 --> 27:55.586
for leaving dirty dishes
in the sink.

27:55.630 --> 27:59.068
I mean, I've come close to
stabbing him over dirty dishes,

27:59.112 --> 28:01.636
but that's different --
we're married.

28:01.680 --> 28:02.898
Mm.

28:02.942 --> 28:04.204
Interviewer: What do you say
to the theory

28:04.247 --> 28:06.249
that Aaron had a falling out
with his roommate?

28:06.293 --> 28:08.991
Aaron and Patrick
were out partying that night.

28:09.035 --> 28:10.689
Does that sound like
a broken friendship

28:10.732 --> 28:12.299
careening towards murder?

28:12.342 --> 28:14.518
By his own admission, Aaron was
taking prescription drugs.

28:14.562 --> 28:17.391
Yeah. For a football injury
he got in high school.

28:17.434 --> 28:20.611
They impair your ability
to operate heavy machinery,

28:20.655 --> 28:23.397
not -- not turn you
into a hardened killer.

28:24.659 --> 28:27.009
Aaron passed out early.

28:27.053 --> 28:28.228
Woke up in the middle
of the night.

28:28.271 --> 28:31.753
Went to pee
and found Patrick's body.

28:41.067 --> 28:43.765
The French police took one look
at a young Black man,

28:43.809 --> 28:45.680
and decided he was the killer.

28:45.724 --> 28:48.161
I mean, they didn't even pursue
any other suspects.

28:48.204 --> 28:49.858
Bonjour, I appreciate you
speaking with me.

28:49.902 --> 28:52.252
Your accent
is terrible.

28:52.295 --> 28:53.644
Um, Detective,
you've been accused

28:53.688 --> 28:55.995
of leading an incredibly biased
investigation --

28:56.038 --> 28:57.779
<i>Mais non.</i>

28:57.823 --> 28:59.259
We followed the facts.

28:59.302 --> 29:01.217
Mm. And the fact
that Patrick picked up

29:01.261 --> 29:02.697
a woman at the club
that night?

29:02.741 --> 29:03.959
Collette Lavinge?

29:04.003 --> 29:06.614
She was seen leaving
the apartment

29:06.657 --> 29:08.094
before the time of death.

29:08.137 --> 29:09.443
Understand?

29:09.486 --> 29:11.662
What about her jealous,
controlling boyfriend?

29:11.706 --> 29:12.838
Did you interview him?

29:15.144 --> 29:17.756
- No. We did not.
- Mm.

29:17.799 --> 29:19.235
Interviewer: But the thing that
ultimately got you released

29:19.279 --> 29:21.934
from prison was the
identification of this man.

29:21.977 --> 29:23.326
Aaron: Yeah.
Collette's boyfriend, Julien.

29:23.370 --> 29:25.938
Handsome. French.

29:25.981 --> 29:27.678
And, you know,
let's just say it --

29:27.722 --> 29:29.289
he's super white.
You know?

29:29.332 --> 29:30.899
Uh, what is --

29:30.943 --> 29:33.293
What is "Finance Bro"
in French?

29:33.336 --> 29:35.817
Shouldn't you know that?
You spent years in France.

29:35.861 --> 29:38.080
Yeah, but I didn't --
I didn't retain it.

29:38.124 --> 29:41.214
It was actually a group
of Internet sleuths

29:41.257 --> 29:42.998
who found
Collette's boyfriend.

29:43.042 --> 29:46.349
They spent countless hours
investigating Aaron's case.

29:46.393 --> 29:48.090
They also pointed
the finger at dozens

29:48.134 --> 29:49.788
of innocent people,
ruining their lives.

29:49.831 --> 29:52.834
Yes. Some members of the group
took it a little too far.

29:52.878 --> 29:55.445
Interviewer:
We've been looking at the
Internet sleuths, actually.

29:55.489 --> 29:59.188
Any chance you post under
the title "truecrimejunkie"?

30:00.233 --> 30:01.190
I...

30:02.888 --> 30:05.629
That -- That --
That doesn't s--

30:05.673 --> 30:07.980
I might have logged on once --
once or twice, yeah.

30:08.023 --> 30:09.720
Seriously?

30:09.764 --> 30:11.635
I mean, can you not see
how people would take that

30:11.679 --> 30:13.115
as a clear sign of bias?

30:13.159 --> 30:17.032
I categorically deny any
preferential treatment, okay?

30:17.076 --> 30:18.294
Interviewer: How can you say
that with a straight face,

30:18.338 --> 30:19.861
when it was revealed that Julien
was the son

30:19.905 --> 30:21.515
of the French
Finance Minister?

30:21.558 --> 30:23.038
Are you telling me you didn't
get a phone call asking you --

30:23.865 --> 30:24.910
<i>Merci beaucoup.</i>

30:24.953 --> 30:26.215
<i>C'est terminé.</i>

30:26.259 --> 30:27.651
<i>Merci.</i>

30:27.695 --> 30:29.610
Oh, come on. Don't do that.
Come back.

30:29.653 --> 30:31.220
Interviewer: So, it must've been
so frustrating to learn

30:31.264 --> 30:33.092
that the French police
knew his identity

30:33.135 --> 30:35.877
before your first trial
and didn't say anything.

30:35.921 --> 30:37.313
I mean, yeah.
The -- The good news

30:37.357 --> 30:40.621
was that the fact
that they ignored Julien --

30:40.664 --> 30:42.884
uh, it got me my retrial.

30:42.928 --> 30:47.584
But the bad news was the
unidentified DNA on the knife --

30:47.628 --> 30:49.021
it -- it didn't belong
to Julien.

30:49.064 --> 30:51.240
So he --
You know, he had an alibi.

30:51.284 --> 30:52.720
As horrible
as the experience was,

30:52.763 --> 30:54.678
is there anything that you
actually miss from that time?

30:54.722 --> 30:56.202
I miss?

30:56.245 --> 30:57.159
God, no.

30:57.203 --> 30:59.335
W--

30:59.379 --> 31:00.902
Well, Carlos.

31:00.946 --> 31:01.947
Carlos?

31:01.990 --> 31:02.861
Yeah.

31:02.904 --> 31:05.080
Uh, Carlos the Jackal.

31:05.124 --> 31:06.908
He -- He was my cellmate.

31:06.952 --> 31:09.693
And, uh, man, pbht,
he has some stories.

31:09.737 --> 31:11.608
So you're saying the Jackal
got you through

31:11.652 --> 31:13.262
your year and a half
of incarceration?

31:13.306 --> 31:14.481
No.

31:14.524 --> 31:15.482
My mom did.

31:15.525 --> 31:17.353
Yeah, I don't --

31:17.397 --> 31:19.399
I don't think I would have got
through it without her.

31:19.442 --> 31:20.791
Um...

31:20.835 --> 31:24.534
She actually leased an apartment
in Paris

31:24.578 --> 31:26.014
until I was released.

31:26.058 --> 31:28.321
And, uh, she visited me
every week.

31:28.364 --> 31:30.192
And I'll tell you what.
If they would have let her,

31:30.236 --> 31:31.280
she would have been over there
every day.

31:31.324 --> 31:32.891
Of course I moved to Paris.

31:32.934 --> 31:34.370
I'm his mother.

31:34.414 --> 31:36.938
I would have served the prison
time for him if I could.

31:36.982 --> 31:38.113
You're a close family.

31:38.157 --> 31:39.114
We are.

31:39.158 --> 31:40.637
We've been tested.

31:40.681 --> 31:42.378
Were you close
with Patrick?

31:42.422 --> 31:43.553
Yes.

31:43.597 --> 31:44.859
I adored him.

31:44.903 --> 31:46.469
He was a wonderful boy.

31:46.513 --> 31:47.688
According
to your friends,

31:47.731 --> 31:48.732
you thought Patrick
was a troublemaker,

31:48.776 --> 31:49.951
and a bad influence
on Aaron.

31:49.995 --> 31:52.258
Anyone who said that
was lying.

31:52.301 --> 31:55.565
Yvonne -- were you in Paris
the day Patrick was murdered?

31:56.827 --> 31:59.656
Of course not.
I was here in LA.

31:59.700 --> 32:01.006
How do you explain
this footage,

32:01.049 --> 32:02.964
taken the day
of Patrick's murder?

32:11.103 --> 32:12.495
Oh, hell, no.

32:12.539 --> 32:13.627
This interview is over.

32:13.670 --> 32:15.585
Yvonne.
No. No.

32:15.629 --> 32:17.544
We did not okay
this question.

32:17.587 --> 32:19.372
Who do you think you are?

32:19.415 --> 32:20.721
Fired!

32:20.764 --> 32:21.635
I actually don't work
for you.

32:21.678 --> 32:22.418
You need to kiss my ass.

32:26.248 --> 32:28.468
Interviewer: Did you know
that your mother was in Paris

32:28.511 --> 32:29.164
the day that
Patrick was killed?

32:29.208 --> 32:30.905
What?

32:30.949 --> 32:33.255
No, she was --
she was home in LA.

32:33.299 --> 32:35.127
Mm. We have footage
of her shopping

32:35.170 --> 32:37.172
on the Champs-Elysées
the night of the murder.

32:37.216 --> 32:39.522
Okay, well, that --
That's impossible.

32:39.566 --> 32:40.697
Isn't this her?

32:50.533 --> 32:51.578
Okay.

32:53.493 --> 32:55.190
Officer Thorsen,
come back.

32:55.234 --> 32:57.584
Come on.
Let's finish this interview.

32:57.627 --> 32:59.673
Man:
Hey, there he is.

32:59.716 --> 33:00.935
- Aaron: You lied to me.
- Jimmy, get down.

33:00.979 --> 33:02.415
You lied to everyone.

33:02.458 --> 33:04.112
I didn't want all
my private business out there

33:04.156 --> 33:05.374
for all the world
to see.

33:05.418 --> 33:07.072
Mom, you are literally producing

33:07.115 --> 33:08.464
a reality show
about our lives.

33:08.508 --> 33:10.162
That's different.

33:10.205 --> 33:12.381
I was on trial for murder,
fighting for my life.

33:12.425 --> 33:13.730
Exactly.

33:13.774 --> 33:16.037
The fact that I was even
in Paris on that night --

33:16.081 --> 33:17.299
how does that help you?

33:17.343 --> 33:18.431
Interviewer: And what was
your reaction

33:18.474 --> 33:19.693
to the revelation
that Aaron's mother

33:19.736 --> 33:21.173
was in Paris at the time
of the murder?

33:21.216 --> 33:23.044
Like, bombshell.
Game changer.

33:23.088 --> 33:25.438
I mean, none of this stuff came
out at the time of the trial.

33:25.481 --> 33:26.787
This is --

33:26.830 --> 33:28.789
It's so exciting,
what it means for the case --

33:28.832 --> 33:31.052
Not for Aaron.
His mom lied to him.

33:31.096 --> 33:33.620
Y-Yes, that --
Well, that is true.

33:36.536 --> 33:37.841
Thanks for coming back in.

33:37.885 --> 33:39.191
We just need
to clear something up

33:39.234 --> 33:40.627
about the night Patrick
was killed.

33:40.670 --> 33:43.412
Patrick? I thought this was
about Morris's murder.

33:43.456 --> 33:45.284
Oh, it's about both.

33:45.327 --> 33:48.765
See, you felt Patrick
was a bad influence on your son.

33:48.809 --> 33:50.941
So you flew Aaron to Paris
to separate them.

33:50.985 --> 33:53.466
Only Patrick
followed Aaron there,

33:53.509 --> 33:55.642
so you took matters
into your own hands.

33:55.685 --> 33:57.948
You flew to Paris,
you killed Patrick.

33:57.992 --> 33:59.863
But somehow Morris
found out,

33:59.907 --> 34:02.475
so to keep
your deadly secret,

34:02.518 --> 34:03.911
you killed him too.

34:05.434 --> 34:09.003
Yeah,
that's a fun theory --

34:09.047 --> 34:11.484
a good story --
but you're wrong.

34:11.527 --> 34:13.225
Then explain
why you went to Paris

34:13.268 --> 34:15.183
and why you kept it
a secret.

34:15.227 --> 34:18.360
Because I was
with Jean-Pierre Darby.

34:18.404 --> 34:19.927
Who?
The footballer?

34:19.970 --> 34:23.322
Yes, we met a month before,
at a fashion show in Milan.

34:23.365 --> 34:24.671
I'm -- I'm sorry.

34:24.714 --> 34:27.195
You went to Paris for an
international bootie call?

34:27.239 --> 34:28.283
Yes.

34:28.327 --> 34:29.937
And we were in bed
all night.

34:29.980 --> 34:31.286
Ask him.

34:31.330 --> 34:33.854
Hell, ask the neighbors.

34:33.897 --> 34:35.986
Yvonne: They were determined
to convict you.

34:36.030 --> 34:37.988
Had it come out
that I was in town,

34:38.032 --> 34:39.555
they would've used it
against you,

34:39.599 --> 34:42.341
said that we were conspiring
to kill Patrick.

34:42.384 --> 34:45.518
Coming clean would've only hurt
your case, made it worse.

34:45.561 --> 34:47.911
Yeah, you know what? I forgot
how good you are at that.

34:47.955 --> 34:48.738
At what?

34:48.782 --> 34:50.914
At justifying yourself.

34:50.958 --> 34:53.830
You lied in a murder trial,
you cheated on your husband,

34:53.874 --> 34:56.006
and now you're the hero,
right?

34:56.050 --> 34:57.399
Yeah. Sure, Mom.

34:57.443 --> 34:58.531
We'll go with that.

35:03.927 --> 35:05.451
Interviewer: You accused Aaron's
mother of the murder.

35:05.494 --> 35:07.366
With almost no evidence
to back it up.

35:07.409 --> 35:08.628
I -- I did.

35:08.671 --> 35:11.935
And, uh, in my defense,

35:11.979 --> 35:14.068
I'd been scrubbing
reality show footage

35:14.112 --> 35:15.939
for over 200 hours
at that point.

35:15.983 --> 35:17.550
So who broke the case?

35:17.593 --> 35:19.029
Oh, that was
Detective Lopez.

35:19.073 --> 35:21.119
My wife is a badass.

35:21.162 --> 35:22.685
We knew the murders
were connected.

35:22.729 --> 35:24.383
And we knew that
Patrick's murder in Paris

35:24.426 --> 35:25.732
was never
properly investigated.

35:25.775 --> 35:28.169
So I dug
back into that case.

35:28.213 --> 35:30.302
Right now I'm just trying
to build a timeline,

35:30.345 --> 35:32.913
getting to know more
about Patrick's life.

35:32.956 --> 35:35.089
What did the four of you do
that last month?

35:35.133 --> 35:36.395
No detail is too small.

35:36.438 --> 35:38.484
Um...

35:38.527 --> 35:41.182
Let's ask my brain.

35:41.226 --> 35:43.271
I can tell you one thing
that we definitely didn't do.

35:43.315 --> 35:44.751
Go to class.

35:44.794 --> 35:46.796
I mean, Aaron's parents
let him borrow their private jet

35:46.840 --> 35:48.885
anytime he wanted,
so we went all around Europe.

35:48.929 --> 35:51.410
I mean, Italy.

35:51.453 --> 35:52.411
Greece.

35:52.454 --> 35:53.238
French Riviera.

35:54.326 --> 35:55.109
Can I see?

35:55.153 --> 35:56.545
Yeah.

35:56.589 --> 35:58.243
I thought --
screw school,

35:58.286 --> 36:00.462
when am I ever gonna get to
visit planet rich again, right?

36:00.506 --> 36:03.248
So, Santorini
for the weekend?

36:03.291 --> 36:04.423
Yes, please.

36:04.466 --> 36:06.164
These photos of you guys
on the tarmac,

36:06.207 --> 36:08.078
you always have
so much luggage.

36:08.122 --> 36:09.384
I know.

36:09.428 --> 36:11.865
Rowan always acted like
it was the Oregon Trail.

36:11.908 --> 36:13.475
Why?
Every time I've seen him,

36:13.519 --> 36:15.347
he was wearing a golf tee
and jeans.

36:15.390 --> 36:16.783
Not exactly
a clotheshorse.

36:16.826 --> 36:19.264
Oh, uh...

36:19.307 --> 36:20.482
True.

36:20.526 --> 36:22.092
I wonder
what was in there.

36:22.136 --> 36:24.269
Did you ever see Rowan
with drugs back then?

36:24.312 --> 36:25.618
I mean -- yeah.

36:25.661 --> 36:27.402
He was always kind of
"the life of the party,"

36:27.446 --> 36:28.490
if you know what I mean.

36:28.534 --> 36:30.231
Why?
Before Paris,

36:30.275 --> 36:32.799
Rowan's family in Iowa
was in financial trouble.

36:32.842 --> 36:34.192
He almost dropped
out of school.

36:34.235 --> 36:36.716
Now he lives in Brentwood
and drives a Porsche.

36:36.759 --> 36:38.544
I guess?

36:38.587 --> 36:41.242
I -- I see
you're very excited,

36:41.286 --> 36:43.549
and I love that --
I -- I'm not really following.

36:43.592 --> 36:44.637
I...

36:45.594 --> 36:47.248
Hey, Nolan.

36:47.292 --> 36:48.554
Where's Rowan?

36:48.597 --> 36:50.077
Uh, he just left.

36:50.120 --> 36:51.644
Why? I thought
you were done with him?

36:51.687 --> 36:53.646
I was -- until I realized
he's the one who killed Patrick.

36:57.302 --> 36:58.825
Alright. Here we go.
Here we go.

36:58.868 --> 37:00.261
Keith: Nice, nice.

37:00.305 --> 37:01.436
Bro, it's been crazy.

37:01.480 --> 37:02.655
I've added like
half a million followers

37:02.698 --> 37:04.309
from all the publicity.

37:04.352 --> 37:06.833
What? You think, uh --
You think, uh, Aaron did it?

37:06.876 --> 37:07.877
Pbht. Of course he did.

37:07.921 --> 37:09.401
The guy's a total psycho.

37:09.444 --> 37:10.663
Okay, watch this --

37:15.015 --> 37:16.582
Aw. Fudge.

37:16.625 --> 37:17.583
Hold on,
I'm gonna do it again --

37:17.626 --> 37:18.497
Okay, okay.

37:18.540 --> 37:21.630
Rowan.
What the hell?

37:21.674 --> 37:23.066
We got a warrant
for your arrest.

37:23.110 --> 37:24.024
What?

37:24.067 --> 37:25.852
For what?

37:25.895 --> 37:28.289
Lucy: For the murders of
Patrick Hayes and Morris Mackey.

37:28.333 --> 37:29.377
Oh, snap.

37:29.421 --> 37:30.944
That's crazy.

37:30.987 --> 37:32.206
And wrong.

37:32.250 --> 37:34.252
I didn't --
why would you even think that?

37:34.295 --> 37:35.905
Because Patrick found out
you were smuggling drugs

37:35.949 --> 37:38.343
in Aaron's private jet, and
threatened to tell the police.

37:38.386 --> 37:40.606
Somehow Morris found out
that you killed Patrick

37:40.649 --> 37:42.912
to protect your secret,
so you killed him too.

37:42.956 --> 37:44.174
- Come on.
- That's -- I mean --

37:44.218 --> 37:45.263
That's so -- so wrong --

37:45.306 --> 37:46.786
- Hey! Rowan!
- Rowan!

37:48.744 --> 37:50.006
- Okay.
- Keith: Bro, wait.

37:53.271 --> 37:54.881
- Oh.
- Oh, snap.

37:59.015 --> 38:00.626
Lucy: You okay?

38:00.669 --> 38:02.192
Alright, you're fine.

38:02.236 --> 38:03.716
Stand up.

38:03.759 --> 38:05.326
- Tim: Put it down.
- You're under arrest.

38:05.370 --> 38:08.111
Rowan always had
these crazy plans.

38:08.155 --> 38:10.244
You know,
"Let's go to Morocco,"

38:10.288 --> 38:13.203
or, "Dude, I heard about
this sick party in Ibiza..."

38:13.247 --> 38:17.730
And I -- I --
I never thought about it,

38:17.773 --> 38:21.516
but he was the one who decided
where we were flying to always.

38:21.560 --> 38:23.866
And, you know,
now, looking back at it,

38:23.910 --> 38:27.870
with "cop eyes," I mean,
it is so obvious

38:27.914 --> 38:30.569
that Rowan
was up to something.

38:30.612 --> 38:31.918
I just could never see it.

Patrick did, though.
