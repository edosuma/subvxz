-Do you need a drink?

01:43.564 --> 01:45.358
No, no, no, no.
Not while they're watching.

01:45.441 --> 01:47.527
Just drink the fucking water.

01:49.737 --> 01:51.572
Oh, hey, hey.
You're letting her drink?

01:51.656 --> 01:53.574

01:55.368 --> 01:56.661

they'll keep this going?

I don't know,
but if they trying to break 'em,

02:16.681 --> 02:19.517
I say they buy some big crosses

02:19.600 --> 02:21.602
or, like, a giant wheel or some shit,

02:21.686 --> 02:23.604
'cause we running outta table space.

02:23.688 --> 02:25.606
A giant wheel could be fun.

I don't feel bad for them bitches.

Whatever they did,
they probably deserve it.

-[Suzanne] Hmm.
-See, I just wish they'd put up a curtain,

02:32.197 --> 02:34.907
so we don't have to see 'em
get what they deserve.

02:36.534 --> 02:38.869

-I know. I fell asleep. [chuckles]

02:47.337 --> 02:49.547
Oh, is that so?

02:50.172 --> 02:54.051
'Cause, see, I thought
I saw you starting to walk in...

02:54.134 --> 02:55.553
and then walk away.

02:55.636 --> 02:58.138
Oh, maybe you was just sleepwalking.

02:58.223 --> 02:59.807
I'll come talk with you after supper.

02:59.890 --> 03:04.312

04:13.881 --> 04:15.883
What's going on?

04:17.260 --> 04:19.136
[softly] They found
a guard's body in the garden.

04:19.219 --> 04:20.971
-What?
-Yeah.

04:21.055 --> 04:23.641
All chopped up in potato sacks.

04:23.724 --> 04:25.142
That's fucked up, right?

04:26.352 --> 04:27.770
In the garden?

04:44.454 --> 04:46.956
So how'd they know it was a guard?

04:47.039 --> 04:49.166
I heard they found pieces of his uniform.

to that crazy bitch?

05:34.044 --> 05:35.463

05:35.546 --> 05:38.340

you don't know who he is?

08:57.873 --> 08:59.416
Don't y'all have records?

08:59.499 --> 09:01.752
How does a CO go missing
without anybody noticing?

09:01.836 --> 09:03.212
In Afghanistan, this would never happen.

09:03.295 --> 09:05.631
Yeah, in Afghanistan,
we knew everyone on our team.

09:05.715 --> 09:09.051
Here we played one game of Two Truths
and a Lie with half of the group,

09:09.134 --> 09:10.553
and then it was like,
"Good luck, see you later."

09:10.636 --> 09:14.514
All right, listen.
I understand emotions are high.

09:14.599 --> 09:16.391
What I need from all of you

09:16.475 --> 09:19.311
is to hold down the fort
until the feds arrive.

09:19.394 --> 09:21.939
So what, we just sit here all night
with a killer on the loose?

09:24.024 --> 09:27.444
A killer is not on the loose.
A killer is in prison.

09:27.527 --> 09:29.154
-Right.

09:29.238 --> 09:31.115
-Oh, wow.
-We're safe. Great.

09:31.198 --> 09:33.618
MCC wants me in Utica with them.

09:33.701 --> 09:37.079
They need to be briefed on the situation,
and I am more than confident

09:37.162 --> 09:40.540
you can handle yourselves...
on your own.

09:40.625 --> 09:42.793
-We usually do.
-What?

09:42.877 --> 09:45.087
This is insane. You got us in here
with gangsters and murderers.

09:45.170 --> 09:46.338
You don't even know who your guards are.

09:46.421 --> 09:49.634
Yeah, why should we wait for the FBI
to put pressure on these women?

09:51.385 --> 09:54.054
I am trained
in extraction techniques, so--

09:54.138 --> 09:56.348
Let me talk to them.
I'll get the 411.

09:56.431 --> 09:57.683
No!

09:57.767 --> 10:02.437
No cowboy shit.
The worst reaction is an overreaction.

10:02.521 --> 10:06.651
I am sure Captain Piscatella
would agree with me...

10:07.567 --> 10:08.819
were he here.

10:09.319 --> 10:11.906
Yes, sir.
Exactly as you say, sir.

10:15.075 --> 10:17.787
I assure you
no one is taking this lightly,

10:17.870 --> 10:24.251
but it is an unprecedented situation
that requires a measured response.

10:24.334 --> 10:27.838
Keep them locked down,
be courteous, be professional,

10:27.922 --> 10:30.007
and the feds will be here in the morning.

10:30.090 --> 10:31.383
Captain.

10:34.303 --> 10:36.931
[man speaking indistinctly
on walkie-talkie]

10:38.766 --> 10:39.934
Okay. [sighs]

10:40.017 --> 10:41.351
Now that that's over with,

10:41.435 --> 10:43.896
here's a list of inmates
I wish to speak to.

10:43.979 --> 10:47.066
-I need records and behavior reports.
-[Blake] Yes, sir.

10:47.858 --> 10:50.820
[Piscatella] The lights
will stay on all night.

10:50.903 --> 10:53.238
If you wanna take 'em to the bathroom,
that's up to you,

10:53.322 --> 10:56.116
but you are under
no obligation to do so.

10:56.200 --> 10:57.242
Whoa. Wait.

10:57.326 --> 10:59.286
Didn't he just say
not to do what you're doing?

10:59.369 --> 11:00.788
-Donuts!
-I'm sorry, what?

11:02.164 --> 11:05.625
Didn't he just say...
not to do what you're doing?

11:05.710 --> 11:08.921
I didn't hear that.
I heard "unprecedented situation."

11:09.004 --> 11:11.215
I heard, "Don't overreact."

11:11.298 --> 11:12.883
Do you consider questioning inmates

11:12.967 --> 11:16.345
about the murder
of a fellow officer overreacting?

11:18.889 --> 11:20.557
Not when you put it that way, no.

11:20.640 --> 11:21.683
I mean, if you don't feel comfortable,

11:21.767 --> 11:23.894
I do need someone to stay outside
and guard the crime scene.

11:23.978 --> 11:26.897
Outside? At night?
With the body?

11:26.981 --> 11:28.733
Thank you for volunteering.

11:28.816 --> 11:30.525
[all laughing]

11:30.609 --> 11:32.652
That's what you get for asking questions.

11:32.737 --> 11:35.823
Luschek... I want you with Judy King.

11:35.906 --> 11:38.492
Aw, damn it.
Hey, hey, no.

11:38.575 --> 11:40.327
I was not questioning your methods.

11:40.410 --> 11:43.413
All right, I totally respect
your badass authority

11:43.497 --> 11:45.499
that flies in the face
of Caputo's authority.

11:45.582 --> 11:47.960
Follow orders and stay with Judy King.

11:51.130 --> 11:53.632

12:10.858 --> 12:12.609
[softly] There will be no panicking.

12:12.692 --> 12:14.694
You panic, and you give us all away.

12:14.779 --> 12:18.532
Pretend this doesn't concern you,
and with a little luck, it never will.

12:18.615 --> 12:19.992
Are you hearing me?

12:20.075 --> 12:22.077
That doesn't sound like much of a plan.

12:22.161 --> 12:25.289
At this point, they have nothing,
a John Doe.

12:25.372 --> 12:27.166
[whispers] A John Doe
in a guard's uniform.

12:27.249 --> 12:30.169
Well, what about forensics?
DNA? Fingerprints?

12:30.252 --> 12:33.630
Hmm, fingerprints are unlikely
at this point.

12:33.713 --> 12:36.633
As for DNA, they'll find our DNA.

12:36.716 --> 12:40.554
They'll find the DNA from anybody
who's ever walked through that garden.

12:40.637 --> 12:42.389
Which doesn't prove squat.

12:42.472 --> 12:44.641
Play your trump. [grunts]

12:45.559 --> 12:49.271
Most crimes remain unsolved
unless someone talks.

12:49.354 --> 12:51.440
If they question you,
do not speak to them.

12:51.523 --> 12:54.193
They'll tell you someone
has already confessed.

12:54.276 --> 12:57.237
Do not believe it.
It's a manipulation.

12:57.321 --> 13:00.908
Another manipulation?
They hit you repeatedly in the face.

13:01.992 --> 13:03.202
Be ready for that, too.

13:03.285 --> 13:05.329
[Red] More likely,
you won't even be brought in.

13:05.412 --> 13:10.084
However, Frieda, with her record,
they'll definitely talk to.

13:10.167 --> 13:13.670
-What's your record?
-Four murders in a year.

13:13.753 --> 13:15.547
That was a crazy year.
[chuckles]

13:15.630 --> 13:17.341
-Wow.
-[Frieda] But you don't got to worry.

13:17.424 --> 13:22.096
They can grill me
'til I'm burnt on both sides.

13:22.179 --> 13:23.555
I won't squeak.

13:23.638 --> 13:25.975
[Lolly] Eh! Y'all got some wax paper?

13:26.058 --> 13:29.269
It's other parties I'm concerned about.

13:30.104 --> 13:32.647
Nope? Okay.

13:34.149 --> 13:36.443
I'm gonna go find me some wax paper.

13:36.526 --> 13:37.777
Hey, you guys got wax paper?

13:37.862 --> 13:39.238
Shouldn't we be talking to her
about all this?

13:39.321 --> 13:41.240
-Absolutely not.
-Hell, no.

13:47.204 --> 13:49.081
[Yoga Jones breathing deeply]

13:49.164 --> 13:53.335
Well, now, there is a face
I haven't seen for a long while.

13:53.418 --> 13:58.090
Had a lot of, uh, work in...
parts of the prison where you aren't.

13:58.173 --> 13:59.716
Until now.

13:59.799 --> 14:04.596
How fortuitous that this night shift
should just fall into your lap.

14:04.679 --> 14:07.892
What else might fall into your lap?

14:07.975 --> 14:10.019
I wonder. Hmm.

14:11.728 --> 14:12.771
[stammers] What--

14:12.854 --> 14:15.482
Oh, relax.
She has noise-canceling headphones.

14:15.565 --> 14:17.943
You don't own me.

14:18.027 --> 14:20.362
Yeah. Put on your headphones.

14:33.375 --> 14:35.127
Wow. Uh... [chuckles]

14:36.045 --> 14:37.837
You totally made Yoga Jones your bitch.

14:37.922 --> 14:42.259
Oh, no. We just...
help each other out.

14:42.342 --> 14:45.304
[woman on PA]
<i>Restroom privileges are suspended.</i>

14:47.181 --> 14:49.599
Like you and me, officer.

14:49.683 --> 14:52.727
Yeah. Uh... listen,

14:52.811 --> 14:55.730
what happened between us,
it can never happen again.

14:56.815 --> 14:58.692
It isn't professional.

14:58.775 --> 15:02.321
I was thinking...
maybe we could do Molly together?

15:04.656 --> 15:06.866
-You know where to get Molly?
-I already have it.

15:06.951 --> 15:08.994
-How?
-Oh. [stammers]

15:09.078 --> 15:12.706
Honey, you can get
anything in here. [laughs]

15:15.000 --> 15:17.294
Shit. Fine.

15:17.377 --> 15:18.420
[indistinct chatter]

15:18.503 --> 15:22.591
All right. Eyes up front.
We wanna see some people.

15:22.674 --> 15:26.011
-I call your name, step forward.
-[Frieda] Here we go.

15:26.095 --> 15:27.179
[Blake] Cooper.

15:27.930 --> 15:28.931
Johnson.

15:29.848 --> 15:31.266
-Kukudio.
-[inmate 1] What're they doing?

15:31.350 --> 15:33.435
-[inmate 2] What? Why?
-Reznikov.

15:35.229 --> 15:36.813
Front and center. Let's go.

15:37.982 --> 15:39.274
[inmate 3] That's it?

15:46.865 --> 15:47.950
What's this about?

15:48.033 --> 15:49.618
Piscatella wants to speak with you.

15:50.995 --> 15:52.287
Let's go.

15:59.086 --> 16:00.462
Are you kidding me?

16:01.463 --> 16:06.176
Kukudio is a suspect and I'm not?

16:06.260 --> 16:08.637
Heck, I killed a cop with his own gun.

16:09.554 --> 16:11.140
Oh. Wait...

16:12.057 --> 16:14.309
Did I get caught for that?

16:14.393 --> 16:16.853
[sighs] I'm getting old.

16:16.936 --> 16:18.688
[cheering]

16:21.733 --> 16:23.568
Should we be letting 'em dance like that?

16:23.652 --> 16:26.071
-Why not?
-It's inappropriate.

16:26.155 --> 16:28.282
There's a dead officer outside.

16:28.365 --> 16:32.202
Don't work harder than you have to.
It's gonna be a long night.

16:33.037 --> 16:35.372
And we don't even know
who the hell that guy was.

16:36.748 --> 16:38.000
You ever work the ghetto before?

16:38.083 --> 16:40.252
-No.
-Shows.

16:41.170 --> 16:42.587
They give me this post all the time

16:42.671 --> 16:45.507
because they know
that I know how to talk to 'em.

16:45.590 --> 16:47.551
'Cause I'm from Memphis.

16:49.428 --> 16:51.305
You see that dance they're doing?

16:51.388 --> 16:53.348
I can do that dance.

16:54.349 --> 16:55.392
Good for you.

16:56.518 --> 17:00.022
-[Black Cindy grunts rhythmically]
-[indistinct chatter]

17:00.939 --> 17:04.858
Man, what the fuck, Suzanne?
It ain't even eight o'clock.

17:04.943 --> 17:08.738
I need to sleep.
It's nighttime.

17:08.821 --> 17:11.782
If I don't get enough sleep,
my circadian rhythm gets off

17:11.866 --> 17:14.036
-and I'm tired during the day.
-"Circadian"? What the...

17:14.118 --> 17:19.124
Down becomes up. I got the eyesie-closies
and the head-nod, sleepy-jerk wakies.

17:19.208 --> 17:20.584
It's chaos.

17:21.626 --> 17:24.338
Yo, if they ain't gonna
turn off the lights on us,

17:24.421 --> 17:26.756
we might as well treat it
like a slumber party.

17:26.839 --> 17:28.175
Whoa.

17:28.258 --> 17:30.760
I did not enjoy slumber parties.

17:30.844 --> 17:34.056
[Black Cindy scatting]

17:36.225 --> 17:37.517

17:45.234 --> 17:46.276
I got this.

17:46.360 --> 17:48.112
You stay here with your people.

17:50.322 --> 17:51.365
[clears throat]

17:52.782 --> 17:55.077
[Taystee] Get it, Cindy! Get it, Cindy!
[Black Cindy] Hey!

17:55.160 --> 17:56.786
-Warren.
-Hmm?

17:59.289 --> 18:01.875
-[Suzanne] Yes?
-Let's go. Leave that.

18:04.628 --> 18:06.963
[inmate 1] What are they talking about?
Takin'... taking Suzanne away.

18:07.046 --> 18:08.215
[inmate 2] She what?

18:08.298 --> 18:10.049
Hold up.
What's this about?

18:10.134 --> 18:14.888
I'll tell you later. Or I won't.
Come on. Move.

18:24.273 --> 18:25.315
[inmate 3] What?

18:26.400 --> 18:27.609
[gasps] Grace!

-That's wonderful. [chuckles]
-[grunts]

Brad, look.

18:39.496 --> 18:41.248
-Congrats. You should get that framed.
-[clears throat]

18:41.331 --> 18:43.125
Yeah. [chuckles]

18:43.208 --> 18:45.960
What's all this?
Where are you going?

18:46.044 --> 18:47.962
Suzanne, you know we're going
to Saint Mary's for the weekend.

18:48.046 --> 18:52.467
-You said you were fine with it.
-I was when it was a hypothetical.

18:52.551 --> 18:55.262
-And where is Saint Mary's again?
-In Chesapeake Bay.

18:56.095 --> 18:58.890
An island.
But islands are surrounded by water.

18:58.973 --> 19:00.809
What if there's a problem
and I need to reach you?

19:00.892 --> 19:03.895
[stammering] And now there's all this
water between us, and I don't have a boat,

19:03.978 --> 19:05.772
and I have never swum
long-distance before.

19:05.855 --> 19:07.816
-[breathing heavily]
-It's gonna be okay.

19:07.899 --> 19:10.109
-I printed out a schedule for you...
-[exhales sharply]

19:10.194 --> 19:12.654
...and the fridge is full of food,

19:12.737 --> 19:16.200
and you have all your games...
and your pig.

19:16.283 --> 19:19.244
-Grace, I don't know if I'm ready.
-Of course you're ready.

19:19.328 --> 19:22.247
No, I am a young 28.

19:22.331 --> 19:24.333

I literally spend every weekend with you.

19:27.126 --> 19:31.005
I'm asking for two days
alone with my boyfriend.

19:31.923 --> 19:34.133
Maybe you could make
some friends of your own.

19:34.218 --> 19:35.677
It's not that easy.

19:35.760 --> 19:37.596
Hey, sure it is.

19:37.679 --> 19:41.140
You're a people person.
You are Employee of the Month.

20:15.967 --> 20:18.262
-Hey.
-Oh, shit!

-I'm sorry, bro.
-[exhales heavily]

20:21.973 --> 20:24.684
-What are you doing out here?
-Well, I came to say hi.

You know, they filled all the posts,
so I'm kind of a floater.

-You want this one?
-No. No, no, no.

-What? It's good.

20:37.447 --> 20:38.573

If there's no more posts,
why don't you go home?

20:42.577 --> 20:44.538
I don't know, man.
Everyone's here.

20:44.621 --> 20:50.252
It feels like an... important night
in the history of the prison.

20:50.335 --> 20:52.296
It's just a job, man,
and it's not a very good one.

20:52.379 --> 20:55.424
Well, it's definitely different
from what I thought it'd be.

20:55.507 --> 20:59.093
Like, so sad
that it's almost supernatural.

20:59.177 --> 21:01.137
-You know what I mean?
-Sort of.

21:02.055 --> 21:05.016
-Weird shit happens, that's for sure.
-Yeah.

21:05.099 --> 21:07.185
Once, I woke up from a shift
with no pants on.

21:07.269 --> 21:09.313
-Really?
-Yeah, man.

21:09.396 --> 21:11.315
-That's weird.
-Yeah.

21:11.398 --> 21:12.941
So what were you doing
a second ago?

21:13.024 --> 21:14.776
-When?
-When I got here.

21:15.485 --> 21:18.572
Oh, uh, I thought I heard something...
from over there,

21:18.655 --> 21:20.073
the direction of the body parts.

21:25.454 --> 21:28.039
Well, I don't hear anything now, so...

21:28.122 --> 21:29.708
Me neither.

21:29.791 --> 21:32.210
Yeah, nothing to investigate.

21:32.294 --> 21:34.170
Problem solved.

21:34.253 --> 21:35.839
I will leave you to it.

21:41.345 --> 21:44.389

Bing cherry in the regular.

-Yeah.

22:14.586 --> 22:16.004
Could really use your help down here.

22:17.756 --> 22:19.341
I'm on my way.

22:22.344 --> 22:24.471
-I'll go with the Bing cherry.
-Sure.

22:47.326 --> 22:48.369
Yeah?

22:48.453 --> 22:50.204
Oh, you're just pacing around.

22:50.288 --> 22:52.874
[laughs] You kinda look like
Pac-Man chased by ghosts.

22:52.957 --> 22:57.128
Maybe I am working out
a very serious mathematical equation.

22:59.338 --> 23:00.381
Oh, yeah?

23:02.008 --> 23:06.095
So does math make
your skin look all waxy?

23:06.179 --> 23:09.390
Maybe you need some vitamins...
or some heroin.

23:09.474 --> 23:11.100
Yeah, fuck off.

23:11.184 --> 23:12.602
I've been clean for three years.

23:14.646 --> 23:16.940
All right, three days.
Three hours.

23:17.023 --> 23:19.358
I'm fine. I'm quitting.
You know where to cop?

23:19.443 --> 23:20.985
-No.
-[scoffs] No.

23:21.069 --> 23:24.573
All right, so I'm definitely quitting.
Okay. So that's done. Done.

23:24.656 --> 23:27.701
All right? No time like the present
to make the change... [sighs]

23:27.784 --> 23:29.994
especially if you have
no fucking choice in the matter.

23:30.078 --> 23:33.457
So that's good, 'cause I, uh...
I was going to anyway,

23:33.540 --> 23:36.167
'cause I already decided
I wanted to, so I'm okay.

23:36.250 --> 23:39.754
You are really good at lying to yourself.

23:39.838 --> 23:43.299
I had a friend like you once.
Her name was, uh, Keighlyn.

23:43.382 --> 23:47.428
She believed
that she was gonna go to Chicago...

23:47.512 --> 23:52.266
and be on the <i>Oprah</i> show,
and win all the Christmas show stuff.

23:52.350 --> 23:54.143
She had us all believing this, too,

23:54.227 --> 23:57.188
-right up until Oprah quit.
-[groans faintly]

23:57.271 --> 23:58.732
-[Nicky] Hah!
-Plus, after.

23:58.815 --> 24:03.487
I think she's, like, breeding rabbits now
or, um... selling, um...

24:04.278 --> 24:05.321
Arbonne.

24:05.404 --> 24:07.281
Did your mother put the whiskey
in the baby bottle,

24:07.365 --> 24:09.618
or did she just mix it in
with the dog food she fed you?

24:11.077 --> 24:14.163
I mean, I can leave,
but I really thought, as I was walking by,

24:14.247 --> 24:17.041
that you could use a little bit
of distraction from yourself.

24:17.125 --> 24:19.043
It's good to have
something else to focus on, right?

24:19.127 --> 24:20.294
[Pennsatucky] Yeah.

24:21.462 --> 24:22.672
[sighs]

24:24.465 --> 24:25.466
[retching]

24:27.719 --> 24:28.720
[gagging]

24:29.428 --> 24:31.014
-You gotta puke?
-No.

24:31.097 --> 24:33.808
-Are you really good at being in denial?
-Yeah.

24:34.559 --> 24:35.894
[vomiting]

24:38.897 --> 24:41.315
Joe. There are no words, huh?

24:41.399 --> 24:42.859
Who does such a thing?

24:42.942 --> 24:45.153
I don't know.
It's terrible.

24:45.236 --> 24:47.488
Have you met Josh?

24:47.572 --> 24:49.157
Mr. Caputo, nice to meet you.

24:49.240 --> 24:52.035
Josh will help you review
everything you know,

24:52.118 --> 24:54.746
make sure it matches with our records.

24:56.080 --> 24:58.041
That's why you called me down here?

24:59.000 --> 25:00.710
To brief me on what not to say?

25:00.794 --> 25:04.589
When you speak to the FBI,
they can throw you some curveballs.

25:04.673 --> 25:06.424
We can't have you shooting from the hip.

25:06.507 --> 25:07.842
I should be at the prison.

25:07.926 --> 25:10.094
This is more important.

25:10.178 --> 25:13.097
It's for your protection
as much as anyone's, Joe.

25:23.733 --> 25:24.776
Danny.

25:27.528 --> 25:29.322
Who's that?

25:29.948 --> 25:31.199
Hello, Father.

25:31.282 --> 25:34.578
This is Crystal Burset,
wife of Sophia Burset.

25:36.287 --> 25:38.164
You remember Sophia, right?

25:38.247 --> 25:41.334
Who you claim isn't in the SHU?

25:44.045 --> 25:46.505
Why don't you keep that one?
I got a lot more.

25:47.716 --> 25:48.758
[indistinct chatter]

25:48.842 --> 25:51.385
I wanna talk to Piscatella.
This must be some kind of mistake.

25:51.469 --> 25:52.553
I ain't done shit.

25:52.637 --> 25:54.806
Well, if you're here,
that means he wants to talk to you,

25:54.889 --> 25:56.390
-so wait 'til you're called.
-[scoffs]

25:56.474 --> 25:59.185
This is bullshit.
After all I've done for this place?

25:59.268 --> 26:02.772
What's the matter?
You scared now, huh?

26:02.856 --> 26:04.273
'Cause you ain't got
your whole crew here?

26:04.357 --> 26:07.193
I ain't scared of shit.
Bring it, you monkey bitches.

26:07.276 --> 26:08.862
-I'll take you all on!
-Oh, yeah?

26:08.945 --> 26:10.614
-[grunts]
-You wanna take them on?

26:10.697 --> 26:13.199
What about with one hand
tied behind your back, huh?

26:13.908 --> 26:15.451
[grunts]

26:16.620 --> 26:18.705
Did you see that?
He was trying to break my arm.

26:18.788 --> 26:20.414
[inmate] Nobody cares.

26:23.752 --> 26:25.003
Reznikov.

26:34.638 --> 26:36.264
Captain, did you see that?

26:42.270 --> 26:43.730
All right, listen up.

26:43.813 --> 26:46.065
If you're here,
that means you're here for a reason.

26:47.275 --> 26:48.902
Now, if you're innocent, that means...

26:48.985 --> 26:50.779
you shouldn't have anything
to worry about.

26:50.862 --> 26:52.196
But if you cause a problem,

26:52.280 --> 26:53.782
then it doesn't matter
if you're innocent or not,

26:53.865 --> 26:56.492
so sit down and shut your mouth.

26:57.744 --> 26:59.078
[mimics zipper closing]

27:09.881 --> 27:11.758
So, this is messed up.
[chuckles]

27:12.884 --> 27:14.635
We're not supposed to talk.

27:14.719 --> 27:19.640
And I think it's better if I give you
some space and not engage you right now.

27:20.850 --> 27:22.643
Why not?

27:22.727 --> 27:24.896
Do you not remember
what you did to me at movie night?

27:24.979 --> 27:26.480
Are you still mad about that?

27:26.564 --> 27:28.274
It was last night.

27:28.357 --> 27:30.902
Oh, uh, I only did that
so we could be even.

27:32.070 --> 27:36.199
God. You're really
not great at reading people.

27:37.158 --> 27:40.494
No... I guess not.

27:42.621 --> 27:44.165
Excuse me.

27:55.760 --> 27:58.471
Hi! Welcome to the park!

27:59.680 --> 28:00.807
Wel--

28:06.145 --> 28:07.480
Oh. [chuckles]

28:07.563 --> 28:09.232
Dylan!

28:09.941 --> 28:12.235
Hi!
What are you doing here?

28:12.318 --> 28:14.445
I don't live at the store, silly.

28:14.528 --> 28:17.031
You don't? Oh.

28:17.115 --> 28:18.449
Well, did you see my new truck?

28:18.532 --> 28:23.747
-My mom got it for me.
-Oh! That's awesome!

28:24.748 --> 28:26.374
I love trucks.

28:26.457 --> 28:28.001
-Really? But you're a girl.
-Mmm-hmm.

28:28.084 --> 28:30.128
Girls can like trucks.

28:30.211 --> 28:32.046
Well, I don't know
any girls who like trucks.

28:32.130 --> 28:34.215
My brothers don't even like trucks.

28:34.966 --> 28:37.635
-What are they doing?
-[Dylan] Killing ants.

28:38.552 --> 28:41.973
-Do girls do that?
-They can. I don't.

28:42.056 --> 28:45.476
Well, before, they were putting
Tiger Balm on their wieners.

28:46.394 --> 28:48.604
Hey. Are you allowed to eat popsicles?

28:48.687 --> 28:50.774
-Um, yeah.
-Me, too!

28:52.066 --> 28:54.693
I have popsicles at my house.

28:58.197 --> 28:59.991
[door opens]

29:02.827 --> 29:03.912
Red.

29:07.540 --> 29:09.208
Sorry to keep you waiting.

29:10.835 --> 29:12.128
Well, don't be.

29:12.211 --> 29:14.672
I was enjoying the ambience.

29:14.756 --> 29:16.340
So stark...

29:16.424 --> 29:18.051
like I'm back in the Kremlin.

29:19.093 --> 29:20.553
I'm glad you approve.

29:23.431 --> 29:24.891
Do you know why I brought you down here?

29:24.974 --> 29:27.018
-No idea.
-No idea?

29:27.101 --> 29:29.395
No idea.

29:29.478 --> 29:34.442
Well... it has to do with the body
we dug up in the garden.

29:36.735 --> 29:40.156
There's a...
I'm sorry, what?

29:40.239 --> 29:43.076
[chuckles]

29:43.159 --> 29:44.577
So, this is news to you?

29:44.660 --> 29:47.789
I'm shocked.
Who is she?

29:47.872 --> 29:48.998
How do you know it's a she?

29:49.082 --> 29:50.666
Is it?

29:52.626 --> 29:53.669
No.

29:55.171 --> 29:59.508
Captain... [sighs]
I would love to help you,

29:59.592 --> 30:01.886
but I'm not in the mood for games.

30:02.470 --> 30:04.180
Neither am I.

30:04.263 --> 30:06.015
You're head of the Garden Club.

30:06.099 --> 30:09.060
I find it extraordinary...

30:09.143 --> 30:12.271
that you wouldn't have
any useful information for me.

30:12.355 --> 30:14.190
Useful how?

30:14.273 --> 30:17.610
Anything would be appreciated.

30:24.575 --> 30:27.495
Aspirin reduces your risk
of heart attack...

30:28.412 --> 30:31.124
but can be toxic in large amounts.

30:36.462 --> 30:37.588
[scoffs]

30:49.808 --> 30:51.019
[sighs]

30:53.604 --> 30:57.191
Have someone toss Reznikov's bunk
and search her office.

30:57.275 --> 30:59.652
-[CO] Yes, sir.
-Is that really necessary?

30:59.735 --> 31:01.070
We'll see.

31:08.244 --> 31:09.787
[indistinct conversation]

31:11.455 --> 31:13.791
-One of your homies is here.
-Yep.

31:16.252 --> 31:18.922
-What's up?
-You tell me.

31:19.005 --> 31:20.631
How much longer before she back?

31:20.714 --> 31:23.927
Don't sweat it, cuz.
Girlfriend be back in no time.

31:25.011 --> 31:26.971
Why her?
Why is she even named in this shit?

31:27.055 --> 31:29.723
Search me. She probably
just matches the profile, jigaboo.

31:31.059 --> 31:32.101
Jiga-what?

31:32.936 --> 31:34.187
Go back to your cube, inmate.

31:34.270 --> 31:37.773
-But how much longer?
-Probably not more than another hour.

31:37.856 --> 31:41.444
But that's what you said
about an hour ago, jigaboo.

31:42.236 --> 31:45.198
Hey, that...
That's a nice watch.

31:45.281 --> 31:48.784
-Do you mind if I take a look at it?
-[smacks lips] Man, what?

31:48.867 --> 31:50.869
No. Caputo gave me this watch.

31:50.954 --> 31:52.246
Oh, come on, hand it over.
I...

31:52.330 --> 31:54.082
I promise I'll give it back to you.

31:59.087 --> 32:00.296
[sighs]

32:01.839 --> 32:03.299
That is nice.

32:06.385 --> 32:07.929
[gasps]

32:18.397 --> 32:20.441
Now you don't need to worry
what time it is.

32:30.909 --> 32:32.661
[indistinct chatter]

32:37.791 --> 32:40.211
Whatever happens, Red won't crack.

32:40.294 --> 32:41.587
Why should she protect me?

32:42.588 --> 32:44.632
She has no allegiance to me.

32:44.715 --> 32:46.675
It's not about that.

32:53.099 --> 32:56.227
Ooh. Hmm. Hmm.

33:05.278 --> 33:07.655
This is a 600-thread count.

33:07.738 --> 33:08.781
[Judy] Mmm.

33:08.864 --> 33:10.741
But it feels like a million thread count.

33:10.824 --> 33:13.744
[inhaling] Feels as if, ooh...

33:13.827 --> 33:16.247
-butter were a cloth.
-Yeah.

33:16.330 --> 33:19.250
And what is this?

33:19.875 --> 33:23.046
-What?
-This place...

33:23.129 --> 33:25.173
that we live in...

33:26.090 --> 33:29.052
but we're not allowed to leave.

33:29.135 --> 33:30.803
But you can leave.

33:34.182 --> 33:38.602
And somehow, even though you're a guard...

33:38.727 --> 33:42.315
Judy controls both of us.

33:42.398 --> 33:44.858
-Oh. No, no, no, no.
-Yes, she's...

33:44.942 --> 33:47.278
-[laughing]
-[both] Yes, you do.

33:47.361 --> 33:49.822
[both] Yes, you do.
[Judy] No!

33:49.905 --> 33:52.950
You play with people for your amusement.

33:53.034 --> 33:56.370
-Mmm-hmm.
-And... we're only people

33:56.454 --> 33:59.582
because you need people around.

34:00.499 --> 34:04.337
But we're also people
when there are no people around.

34:05.254 --> 34:07.340
Oh, darlin', come here.
Let me just rub your neck.

34:07.423 --> 34:11.719
No. No, this is...
This is false.

34:11.802 --> 34:14.429
I don't know either of you.

34:14.513 --> 34:15.931
You're not my friends.

34:16.014 --> 34:18.266
-We are.
-Hey... no.

34:18.351 --> 34:20.478
-No, no, no, no, no, no, we are.
-Yeah, we are.

34:20.561 --> 34:24.273
No. Judy, you're not a nice person.

34:24.357 --> 34:26.567
-And you're...
-Um...

34:27.318 --> 34:28.527
...Luschek.

34:28.610 --> 34:31.197
-That's true. I am Luschek.
-You don't think that I'm a nice person?

34:31.280 --> 34:33.491
-You are?
-I am.

34:33.574 --> 34:36.244
-I've lost myself.
-Oh...

34:36.327 --> 34:37.411
[Luschek] Mmm.

34:37.495 --> 34:39.371
I act like...

34:39.455 --> 34:41.998
-I'm this spiritual person.
-Mmm-hmm?

34:43.376 --> 34:44.918
But I'm a sham!

34:45.002 --> 34:47.838
-Oh, no, no, darlin'. No, you're not.
-Oh, yes, I am. [sobbing]

34:47.920 --> 34:51.259
No, don't.
You are a beautiful woman.

34:51.342 --> 34:52.717
Look at you.

34:52.801 --> 34:54.094
-[chuckles]
-Really?

34:54.178 --> 34:57.681
Yeah, you're...
Hey, you're both beautiful women.

34:57.765 --> 35:00.184
-[Judy] Aw.
-Aw. For your...

35:00.268 --> 35:04.438
For your ages,
you're both beautiful women.

35:04.522 --> 35:06.649
And, you know,
if I get snippy with you sometimes,

35:06.732 --> 35:08.984
it's just because
I don't think you like me.

35:09.067 --> 35:11.069
-[gasps] Oh.
-Oh, no, I don't.

35:11.154 --> 35:14.448
And I put you down
'cause it makes me feel safe.

35:18.119 --> 35:19.787
You have a life...

35:21.247 --> 35:23.582
that I have always wanted.

35:23.666 --> 35:25.418
-Oh, no.
-Mmm-hmm. [sniffles]

35:26.335 --> 35:30.839
Even now, you have everything.

35:30.923 --> 35:33.426
I don't. Not yet.

35:33.509 --> 35:34.968
[Luschek sighs]

35:35.052 --> 35:36.470
Oh, you.

35:36.554 --> 35:40.766
Oh, you are not here for my amusement.

35:42.476 --> 35:46.272
We are here for each other's amusement.

35:46.355 --> 35:47.773
Mmm-hmm.

35:50.193 --> 35:53.612
[Luschek] Hey, we should
get that feather out again.

35:53.696 --> 35:54.947
Huh?

35:55.030 --> 35:57.325
[Luschek laughing]

35:58.284 --> 35:59.368
Hey.

36:00.828 --> 36:03.372
Oh, shit.

36:03.456 --> 36:04.540
Uh, wait.

36:04.623 --> 36:05.708
Wow.

36:07.835 --> 36:10.128
-I really should've seen this comin'.
-[Judy moans]

36:20.431 --> 36:21.974
Joe.

36:22.057 --> 36:23.726
Linda. Oh.

36:23.809 --> 36:26.479
-I thought you'd have gone.
-I waited for you.

36:27.396 --> 36:28.897
What's going on?
You found a body?

36:28.981 --> 36:30.023
Yeah. [sighs]
Yeah.

36:30.107 --> 36:31.984
You could've given me a heads-up. I...

36:32.067 --> 36:33.527
I like to know things before other people.

36:33.611 --> 36:35.028
I had to hear this from Tim.

36:35.112 --> 36:38.574
I... was dealing with the situation.

36:38.657 --> 36:40.659
-[scoffs]
-I'm sorry. I...

36:40.743 --> 36:41.994
[muttering]

36:42.077 --> 36:43.954
I'm happy to see you, though.

36:44.955 --> 36:47.250
No, no, no, no, no. Not here.
Not in the lobby.

36:47.333 --> 36:50.919
Let's just go home.
You could stay at my place tonight.

36:51.003 --> 36:53.005
Actually, I should be
getting back to the prison.

36:53.088 --> 36:54.507
-I...
-Now?

36:54.590 --> 36:57.676
-I wanna make sure everyone is okay and--
-It's past midnight.

36:57.760 --> 37:00.053
It would make me feel better.

37:00.137 --> 37:03.432
No. That's insane.
There's nothing you can do.

37:03.516 --> 37:05.726
The guards can handle themselves, and...

37:05.809 --> 37:07.645
the girls are safe and sound behind bars.

37:07.728 --> 37:10.856
-Actually, there are no bars.
-No, I mean in their cells.

37:11.607 --> 37:12.941
Not in minimum.

37:15.152 --> 37:17.530
You've never actually
been to Litchfield, have you?

37:22.285 --> 37:24.202
Have you ever been in any prison?

37:26.372 --> 37:28.123
It never seemed necessary.

37:29.041 --> 37:30.376
[chuckles]

37:31.335 --> 37:32.670
What?

37:33.379 --> 37:36.507
-I'll follow you to your car.
-No, you're following me home.

37:39.051 --> 37:40.218
[breathing deeply]

37:40.303 --> 37:41.720
[door opens]

37:44.848 --> 37:49.312
Mr. Piscatella... [sighs]
this is really getting embarrassing.

37:49.395 --> 37:53.148
[sighs] I am a respected woman
in this camp.

37:53.231 --> 37:54.733
Oh, I realize that.

37:54.817 --> 37:57.194
But the respect you earned...

37:57.278 --> 38:00.197
didn't come from making latkes,
did it, Red?

38:00.281 --> 38:03.576
What on earth are you on about now?

38:03.659 --> 38:08.289
You know... [sighs]
I've been in corrections a long time.

38:09.122 --> 38:12.167
I've had inmates spit in my face...

38:12.250 --> 38:14.878
throw piss and shit at me.

38:14.962 --> 38:18.632
I've had people punch me, kick me.
I was even stabbed once.

38:19.842 --> 38:21.594
But I don't hold it against 'em.

38:22.511 --> 38:26.932
In fact, I respect those type
of criminals because they are honest.

38:27.015 --> 38:29.768
They hate me.
I hate them.

38:29.852 --> 38:31.562
Our relationship is simple.

38:31.645 --> 38:34.398
It's your type of criminal

38:34.482 --> 38:37.150
that I find the most offensive.

38:38.694 --> 38:42.865
Are we talking about old women
or all women?

38:42.948 --> 38:46.785
No, we're talkin' about the type
of criminal who tries to be your friend...

38:46.869 --> 38:50.914
who charms you, and seduces you
and makes you like them so much...

38:52.500 --> 38:54.001
you forget they're in here for a reason.

38:55.293 --> 38:59.507
Now, when the police raided your place...

38:59.590 --> 39:02.676
the five people...

39:04.219 --> 39:06.430
they found in your freezer...

39:10.308 --> 39:11.977
Did you cut them up, too?

39:12.936 --> 39:15.230
Oh, that was a long time ago.

39:15.313 --> 39:17.065
People don't change.

39:17.983 --> 39:21.069
I should know.
My mom sent me to gay conversion camp.

39:21.153 --> 39:23.071
[chuckles]

39:23.906 --> 39:28.160
Amazing that you ended up in minimum.

39:30.788 --> 39:34.958
The Russian mob must've sprung
for one hell of a lawyer.

39:36.460 --> 39:38.421
You don't know a thing about me.

39:38.504 --> 39:41.131
I know enough to send you to Max.

39:41.214 --> 39:43.551
I know you won't be
runnin' the kitchen down the hill.

39:43.634 --> 39:45.719
I guarantee you that.

39:45.803 --> 39:49.014
But if you tell me
who else was involved...

39:49.097 --> 39:52.017
maybe I can make things
a little more comfortable for you.

39:52.100 --> 39:56.188
You were better at the bad cop.
The good cop needs work.

39:56.271 --> 39:58.190
You fucking disgust me.

39:58.273 --> 40:00.150
A man...

40:00.233 --> 40:01.902
is dead.

40:02.820 --> 40:06.949
Do you really have
that little regard for human life?

40:07.032 --> 40:08.742
I already told you...

40:09.660 --> 40:12.538
I don't know a thing about it.

40:12.621 --> 40:15.624
You wanna torture me?
Torture me.

40:15.708 --> 40:20.378
Have your private militia waterboard me
and electrocute my fucking face.

40:20.463 --> 40:21.964
Who knows? [chuckles]

40:22.047 --> 40:27.177
Maybe I'll eventually be so out of my head
that I actually confess to this nonsense.

40:27.260 --> 40:29.555
But it won't mean anything.

40:29.638 --> 40:32.683
And it certainly won't prove
you're any kind of detective.

40:32.766 --> 40:34.810
-[sighs]
-We already know you're not.

40:34.893 --> 40:36.812
Otherwise, you wouldn't be working here.

40:36.895 --> 40:38.230
[sniffs]

40:38.313 --> 40:39.982
What was it?

40:40.065 --> 40:41.817
Were you not smart enough?

40:41.900 --> 40:44.945
Or did they just not want
a fairy on the force?

40:47.615 --> 40:48.866
[scoffs]

40:50.158 --> 40:51.243
[knocking on door]

40:51.326 --> 40:53.662
-Yes?
-[door opens]

40:54.538 --> 40:55.623
Sir...

40:56.624 --> 41:00.544
we found these in her office,
behind the file cabinet.

41:04.214 --> 41:06.550
[laughing] Would you look at that?

41:07.801 --> 41:09.136
[chuckles]

41:10.012 --> 41:13.641
Looks like I won't be needin'
that confession after all.

41:18.687 --> 41:20.689
-[retching]
-Yeah, get it out. Get it out.

41:20.773 --> 41:22.775
[coughing]

41:22.858 --> 41:24.151
Get it all out.

41:24.234 --> 41:26.444
[spits] Man, there's nothing left.

41:26.529 --> 41:28.321
Fuck this.

41:28.405 --> 41:30.949
[breathing heavily]

41:33.536 --> 41:36.830
-What is this?
-I made it. [chuckles]

41:36.914 --> 41:38.248
It's a puke basket.

41:39.542 --> 41:41.001
You made this for me?

41:41.084 --> 41:44.171
No, I didn't make it for you,
but I guess you can have it now.

41:44.254 --> 41:46.549
But make sure
you change out those, uh...

41:46.632 --> 41:49.051
trash bags in between
your pukings, please.

41:49.134 --> 41:52.721
Why not just fucking puke in the bags
and, you know, skip the basket?

41:55.473 --> 41:56.892
'Cause I made it.

41:56.975 --> 41:58.476
[laughs]

41:58.561 --> 42:00.228
Ah, touché.

42:01.522 --> 42:03.023
[sighs]

42:05.108 --> 42:07.444
So, what is goin' on with you?

42:08.361 --> 42:09.863
Why are you even here?

42:11.740 --> 42:14.201
Thank you. [grunts]

42:15.202 --> 42:16.537
[Pennsatucky clears throat]

42:16.620 --> 42:19.372
Yeah, I guess I could be
hangin' out with, uh...

42:19.456 --> 42:22.250
Leanne and Angie,
but they're making ear wax art.

42:23.043 --> 42:25.337
I think there's enough
ear wax art in the world.

42:25.420 --> 42:27.089
Uh-huh. For sure.

42:27.172 --> 42:29.550
I wanna do something else with my life.

42:29.633 --> 42:32.260
-When did you decide that?
-On construction,

42:32.344 --> 42:34.680
when I was passin' out the water.
I really liked that job.

42:34.763 --> 42:37.015
And then,
when I would hand them the water...

42:37.099 --> 42:39.059
they just looked so happy, and...

42:39.142 --> 42:40.936
I don't know.
I liked it. I felt wanted.

42:41.019 --> 42:42.688
-Uh-huh.
-Not like that.

42:42.771 --> 42:46.775
No, no, no. Like you possessed
a vital, life-sustaining fluid, right?

42:46.859 --> 42:50.028
-Yeah.
-And now you make baskets.

42:50.112 --> 42:51.404
[Nicky laughs]

42:52.322 --> 42:54.867
I gotta tell ya, you might be
the only person I've ever met

42:54.950 --> 42:57.494
who actually is better
for goin' to prison.

42:57.578 --> 42:59.037
Why is that?

42:59.121 --> 43:02.082
I think I'm smarter
'cause I stopped doin' drugs.

43:02.165 --> 43:03.541
Oh, great.

43:03.626 --> 43:07.796
My biggest fear is, even if I
finally put all this drug shit behind me,

43:07.880 --> 43:09.798
-I'll still be rotten.
-No.

43:09.882 --> 43:11.925
You're all right.

43:12.009 --> 43:14.261
I mean, you're just kinda
bitchy on the outside,

43:14.344 --> 43:16.847
but that's only 'cause
you grew up in New York City.

43:22.352 --> 43:23.937
[inaudible]

43:25.230 --> 43:26.398
-[rustling]
-[gasps]

43:33.822 --> 43:36.116
-[indistinct chatter]
-[inmate snoring]

43:36.199 --> 43:37.743
There's no death penalty
in New York, right?

43:37.826 --> 43:39.327
Jesus, Alex.
Stop it.

43:39.411 --> 43:41.246
-What?
-This.

43:41.329 --> 43:42.956
Thinking?

43:43.040 --> 43:45.083
-No.
-Wanna knock me unconscious?

43:45.167 --> 43:47.335
-No.
-[sighs]

43:47.419 --> 43:48.754
Kind of.

43:49.922 --> 43:51.381
You wanna fuck the pain away?

43:51.464 --> 43:53.801
I wanna do whatever I can
to make you feel better,

43:53.884 --> 43:56.344
and somehow I don't think that sex is it.

43:58.681 --> 44:00.933
Everybody always talks about
how when it's the end of the world,

44:01.016 --> 44:02.184
they'll all start boning.

44:02.267 --> 44:03.601
Hmm.

44:03.686 --> 44:06.354
Do you think that actually happens?
Like...

44:07.981 --> 44:10.776
Like, were people on the <i>Titanic</i>
having weepy sex as it went down,

44:10.859 --> 44:13.445
or were they just... weeping?

44:13.528 --> 44:16.448
I don't know. I guess it depends
on whether you wanna be aware

44:16.531 --> 44:18.325
or you wanna be oblivious at the end.

44:19.284 --> 44:21.536
-Eyes open or legs open.
-Nice.

44:22.579 --> 44:25.498
There's no death penalty
in the state of New York, by the way.

44:25.582 --> 44:28.001
-So, there's that.
-Great.

44:28.085 --> 44:30.045
[footsteps approaching]

44:30.128 --> 44:31.755
Hey. Hi.

44:31.839 --> 44:32.881
Hi, Lolly.

44:32.965 --> 44:34.549
[smacks lips]
Can I talk to you for a sec?

44:44.017 --> 44:46.854
Remember when I found you
in that greenhouse?

44:46.937 --> 44:49.522
-[whispering] Lolly!
-I'm not gonna say anything.

44:49.606 --> 44:54.236
I just need to know, was it real,
or was it, like, a delusion?

44:54.319 --> 44:57.155
Or it... Maybe he was
a hologram or somethin'.

45:02.870 --> 45:05.622
He wasn't a hologram. [chuckles]

45:06.915 --> 45:08.541
That happened.

45:09.835 --> 45:12.755
-You saved my life.
-Okay.

45:14.631 --> 45:17.801
[stammering] Well, then, what...
Why they messin' with Red, then?

45:17.885 --> 45:19.552
I don't know.

45:20.763 --> 45:21.930
[sighs]

45:22.014 --> 45:23.807
[indistinct chatter]

45:23.891 --> 45:27.102
[Humphrey] I mean, you think it's gonna
be hot, but then the bed is wet.

45:27.185 --> 45:28.645
-It stays wet.
-[Stratman] Oh... Yeah.

45:28.728 --> 45:31.189
-Then it's cold--
-Hey. How's it going in here?

45:33.150 --> 45:34.567
Yo, I need to use the bathroom.

45:34.651 --> 45:37.362
-What?
-I need to pee.

45:37.445 --> 45:38.613
Sorry. <i>No comprendo.</i>

45:43.618 --> 45:44.787
[scoffs]

45:44.870 --> 45:46.746
You... You're not gonna
let her go to the bathroom?

45:47.330 --> 45:49.374
Ah, there's no more special privileges.

45:52.169 --> 45:55.213
See this?
This is how I like it.

45:56.173 --> 45:57.424
Them behind glass.

45:57.507 --> 45:59.426
You can't hear 'em.
Can't smell 'em.

45:59.509 --> 46:02.470
Maybe they wouldn't smell that bad
if we just let 'em go to the bathroom.

46:02.554 --> 46:04.139
-[door opens]
-I'm just sayin'.

46:06.474 --> 46:08.351
What the fuck's he doin'?

46:11.771 --> 46:13.481
-[gasps]
-[all laughing]

46:17.444 --> 46:19.154
[Sankey] What the fuck?

46:21.824 --> 46:23.325
[laughing continues]

46:24.242 --> 46:27.412
-Hey, what are you laughin' at?
-Uh, me?

46:27.495 --> 46:29.497
[stutters] We were all laughing.

46:30.999 --> 46:33.919
[breathing heavily] You better sleep
with one eye open.

46:34.627 --> 46:37.214
I can't. I've tried,

46:37.297 --> 46:40.843
and I only get a restful night's sleep
when both eyes are closed.

46:40.926 --> 46:42.302
[inmates laughing]

46:42.385 --> 46:44.096
Hey, you wanna hit her?

46:45.805 --> 46:48.141
You can hit her.
We won't do anything.

46:48.851 --> 46:51.061
Nah. [stutters]
I ain't hittin' no retard.

46:52.437 --> 46:54.022
But she laughed at you.

46:55.773 --> 46:59.361
You're gonna let some black retard
laugh at you like that,

46:59.444 --> 47:01.154
in front of all these people?

47:02.489 --> 47:04.574
Back off, man.
I'm not interested.

47:04.657 --> 47:08.536
I don't care whether you're interested.
I'm tellin' you...

47:08.620 --> 47:09.704
I wanna see a fight.

47:09.787 --> 47:12.540
-I don't wanna fight.
-I do.

47:14.501 --> 47:15.668
I'll fight her.

47:15.752 --> 47:17.629
Now, that's what I'm talkin' about.

47:20.507 --> 47:22.467
Start placin' your bets, boys.

47:22.550 --> 47:25.012
We got a fight!
All right!

47:25.095 --> 47:26.679
-[clapping]
-Yeah!

47:26.763 --> 47:28.932
Huh! Yeah!

47:29.016 --> 47:31.393
[Stratman and Humphrey laughing]

47:32.060 --> 47:35.730
[Suzanne] Ring! Ring! Ring! Ring! Ring!
Oh, Nitro!

47:35.813 --> 47:38.984
Sorry. Sorry, Sky Train.
[grunts]

47:39.067 --> 47:40.818
Come on.
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

47:40.903 --> 47:41.945
Dylan, where are you?

47:42.029 --> 47:45.615
-I don't know.
-[scoffs] You are so far behind.

47:45.698 --> 47:46.909
It's all right.

47:46.992 --> 47:50.828
You might be able to catch up if, if, if--
I just did it again!

47:50.913 --> 47:53.040
I won, again! [chuckles]

47:53.123 --> 47:55.708
-I won the first round.
-Uh, yeah, that's true.

47:55.792 --> 47:58.795
You definitely have
a great natural ability.

47:58.878 --> 48:01.631
And by the end of this weekend,
you're gonna be a monster.

48:02.882 --> 48:06.594
-The weekend?
-Yeah, we can't play video games all day.

48:06.678 --> 48:09.681
The secret to fun is diversification.

48:09.764 --> 48:13.601
[gasps] Oh!
We should do prank phone calls.

48:13.685 --> 48:14.727
I should call my dad.

48:14.811 --> 48:18.982
Ah, that's a good idea.
Ask him if his refrigerator is running.

48:19.066 --> 48:22.319
Oh, wait, but maybe I should do it,
because he will know your voice.

48:22.402 --> 48:24.154
No, I mean, I should go home.

48:24.988 --> 48:26.073
But you just got here.

48:26.990 --> 48:29.701
Okay, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I was-- Maybe I'm moving too fast.

48:29.784 --> 48:32.287
You don't have to stay all night,
as long as you promise to come back

48:32.370 --> 48:34.206
and play the second you wake up.

48:34.289 --> 48:36.666
I mean, you don't have to go yet.
It's not even 5:00.

48:36.749 --> 48:39.294
Do you like capes?
I have a collection.

48:39.377 --> 48:40.670
Wait here.

48:40.753 --> 48:42.630
[squealing]

48:43.798 --> 48:45.717
What's your favorite color?

48:45.800 --> 48:47.094
Dylan?

48:48.011 --> 48:50.055
Uh... red is tasteful.

48:51.348 --> 48:52.390
Oh!

48:53.641 --> 48:55.560
Oh, but black...

48:56.478 --> 49:00.232
is beautiful... and timeless.

49:01.691 --> 49:03.443
[sing-song] Yes.

49:03.526 --> 49:05.028
Yes.

49:05.112 --> 49:07.239
[whispers] He's gonna love it.

49:07.322 --> 49:08.906
-[inhales]
-[Dylan] I don't know where I am.

49:08.991 --> 49:10.617
-We walked from the park.
-Dylan.

49:10.700 --> 49:11.743
[woman on phone]
<i>Please stay on the phone.</i>

49:11.826 --> 49:14.204
-What's going on?
<i>-Dylan?</i>

49:14.287 --> 49:16.414
Who's on the phone?

49:17.540 --> 49:19.459
[woman on phone] <i>Dylan, stay with me.</i>

49:19.542 --> 49:21.253
-You called 911?
<i>-Hello?</i>

49:22.004 --> 49:27.134
Dylan, you only call 911
in the case of an emergency.

49:28.135 --> 49:30.012
Hey, what...

49:31.054 --> 49:33.473
What is going on? Dylan--

49:34.182 --> 49:35.433
I am not the bad guy here, Dylan,

49:35.517 --> 49:37.727
and, you know, it really
hurts my feelings when you--

49:37.810 --> 49:39.729
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop that!

49:39.812 --> 49:43.066
You do not run away from your friends.
Friends do not run away from friends!

49:43.150 --> 49:45.610
Friends do not run away from friend--

49:45.693 --> 49:49.031
Dylan!
You are ruining everything!

49:49.114 --> 49:50.198
Dylan, wait.

49:50.282 --> 49:52.034
Dylan! Wait. Stop.

49:52.117 --> 49:54.827
Stop! Stop! Stop!
Stop! Stop!

49:54.911 --> 49:56.996
Dylan! Dylan! Dylan!

50:01.709 --> 50:02.877
Dylan?

50:04.254 --> 50:05.880
Hi, Katya.

50:06.798 --> 50:08.091
It's Sam.

50:09.634 --> 50:11.553
I... I know it's late.

50:12.470 --> 50:14.306
I'm sorry for calling.

50:16.224 --> 50:17.267
I...

50:17.350 --> 50:21.396
[stuttering] I know that I...
I said that I would stop, and I...

50:21.479 --> 50:22.939
I tried.

50:24.316 --> 50:26.359
<i>But I don't have anyone I can talk to.</i>

50:26.443 --> 50:30.113
<i>I know you felt like</i>
<i>you couldn't talk to me...</i>

50:30.197 --> 50:33.450
<i>which is ironic because it's my job</i>
<i>to talk to people, you know?</i>

50:33.533 --> 50:36.411
<i>It... It's something</i>
<i>I've always taken pride in,</i>

50:36.494 --> 50:38.913
<i>but it's beginning to feel like...</i>

50:40.207 --> 50:43.793
<i>like...</i> [stutters]
<i>I don't know, Katya, maybe...</i>

50:43.876 --> 50:46.171
[stutters] <i>maybe I'm not</i>
<i>very good at my job.</i>

50:46.296 --> 50:48.756
<i>Probably that shouldn't surprise you.</i>

50:48.840 --> 50:50.133
<i>But I've tried.</i>

50:50.217 --> 50:51.718
Give it to me! Come on!

50:51.801 --> 50:53.720
[Healy] <i>I've really tried so hard,</i>

50:53.803 --> 50:56.639
<i>but the harder I try,</i>
<i>the worse things seem to get.</i>

50:56.723 --> 51:00.643
<i>I'm not saying this to excuse myself</i>
<i>for any way I treated you.</i>

51:03.480 --> 51:06.441
<i>But just to say I'm sorry.</i>

51:08.067 --> 51:10.278
<i>No matter what happens...</i>

51:12.530 --> 51:13.865
[chuckles]

51:15.867 --> 51:17.702
[Healy] <i>...I only want the best for you.</i>

51:20.288 --> 51:21.789
<i>You and Pavla.</i>

51:23.500 --> 51:24.917
I'm sorry...

51:27.504 --> 51:29.797
calling you so late. I...

51:30.840 --> 51:32.049
[sighs]

51:33.260 --> 51:35.970
You don't have to call me back, okay?

51:37.680 --> 51:39.141
[cell phone beeps]

52:09.837 --> 52:12.215
[cell phone ringing]

52:19.264 --> 52:20.307
[shuddering]

52:35.154 --> 52:36.989
-[inmates clamoring]
-I don't wanna fight you.

52:37.073 --> 52:38.115
-Why not?
-Hit her! Hit her!

52:38.200 --> 52:41.411
What, are you too good to fight me?
You know, that hurts.

52:41.953 --> 52:45.122
We could've had a life together,
and we could've lived in the forest.

52:45.207 --> 52:46.666
I barely know you.

52:46.749 --> 52:50.169
-Because you never gave me the chance.
-Please don't push!

52:50.253 --> 52:51.338
Well, then fight me.
Fight me!

52:51.421 --> 52:53.756
I... I don't wanna do this!

52:53.840 --> 52:56.343
Well, you might as well.
You don't know how romance works.

52:56.426 --> 52:58.345
You don't even know how people work.

52:58.428 --> 53:00.179
-Get back in there.
-Be quiet.

53:00.263 --> 53:02.139
-Be quiet!
-And you never will.

53:02.224 --> 53:04.351
You'll always be the person
that everybody laughs at.

53:04.434 --> 53:08.813
-Shut up!
-The same pathetic loser virgin!

53:08.896 --> 53:10.607
-Stop it!
-[gasps]

53:10.690 --> 53:11.733
Stop it!

53:11.816 --> 53:13.610
[both grunting]

53:13.693 --> 53:17.614
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
I told you to stop it!

53:17.697 --> 53:22.118
[sobbing] Shut up! Shut up!
Shut up! Shut up!

53:22.201 --> 53:24.954
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

53:25.037 --> 53:28.875
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
You shut up!

53:28.958 --> 53:31.878
I told you to shut up!
Shut up! Shut up!

53:31.961 --> 53:34.381
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

53:34.464 --> 53:36.549
[Maria] Whoa. That's enough.
That's enough.

53:36.633 --> 53:38.843
-[Suzanne sobbing] Shut up! Shut up!
-[Maria shushing]

53:38.926 --> 53:40.262
Shut up.

53:40.345 --> 53:42.096
-Well, I just made $20.
-[Suzanne crying]

53:42.179 --> 53:43.640
[Maria] Shh. Shh.

53:54.442 --> 53:55.818
-Hey.
-[startled grunt]

53:56.736 --> 53:57.945
Shit.

53:58.029 --> 53:59.531
[man speaking indistinctly
on walkie-talkie]

53:59.614 --> 54:01.991
-What time is it?
-4:00-ish?

54:02.074 --> 54:03.242
[sighs]

54:03.326 --> 54:05.370
-You sleeping?
-No.

54:06.288 --> 54:08.122
Maybe for a second.

54:09.165 --> 54:10.583
I didn't think I'd see you again.

54:10.667 --> 54:12.043
Well, I told you I'd come back.

54:12.126 --> 54:13.753
You seemed pretty spooked before.

54:13.836 --> 54:17.256
Yeah, well, it's... scarier inside.

54:17.340 --> 54:18.550
What does that mean?

54:19.301 --> 54:21.052
-Nothing, man.
-No. What does that mean?

54:21.135 --> 54:23.471
Uh, nothing.
Did you read the book?

54:26.140 --> 54:28.393
A little.
It's pretty fucked up.

54:28.476 --> 54:33.606
And you still managed to sleep, you know,
after reading <i>It</i> and all the real stuff?

54:33.690 --> 54:35.149
Actually, pretty impressive.

54:35.983 --> 54:38.820
Yeah, well, I guess you can get
used to anything, right?

54:40.738 --> 54:42.365
Yeah, I guess so.

54:43.866 --> 54:45.159
[inmates snoring]

55:06.556 --> 55:08.265
[breathing heavily]

55:09.684 --> 55:10.727
Yeah?

55:12.061 --> 55:13.896
I need to talk to Piscatella.

55:15.357 --> 55:16.483
[walkie-talkie clicks]

55:16.566 --> 55:17.775
Captain Piscatella.

55:17.859 --> 55:19.486
[walkie-talkie beeps]

55:19.569 --> 55:20.653
Yes, here.

55:20.737 --> 55:23.197
<i>This is Rikerson in the suburbs.</i>

55:23.280 --> 55:26.283
<i>I've got a inmate here,</i>
<i>says she has some information.</i>

55:26.993 --> 55:28.911
Little late. We already have a name.

55:28.995 --> 55:31.498
Do me a favor.
Bring down Lolly Whitehill.

55:31.581 --> 55:33.124
<i>Copy that, sir.</i>

55:36.085 --> 55:37.294
[sighs]

55:39.464 --> 55:41.716
So, you wanna tell me
where you were all night?

55:43.510 --> 55:45.595
And why you're wet?

55:47.847 --> 55:49.724
[water trickling]

55:51.559 --> 55:53.102
I walked into the lake.

55:55.980 --> 55:57.106
Cool.

55:57.815 --> 55:58.900
[Rikerson] <i>Captain, you there?</i>

55:59.651 --> 56:01.736
-Yes.
-Whitehill's not here.

56:01.819 --> 56:03.237
What do you mean, she's not there?

56:03.320 --> 56:04.739
I don't know. She must have--

56:04.822 --> 56:07.575
She's... she's just not here.

56:07.659 --> 56:09.869
Jesus H. Christ. Find her.

56:09.952 --> 56:11.370
<i>-She couldn't have left the building.</i>
-[sighs]

56:11.454 --> 56:13.372
I'm sounding the alarm.

56:13.456 --> 56:16.459
I know where she is.
You don't have to sound the alarm.

56:18.795 --> 56:19.837
[Piscatella] Eighty-six the alarm.

56:21.005 --> 56:22.339
Down here?

56:38.440 --> 56:39.899
Hi, Mr. Healy.

56:40.900 --> 56:44.195
-Hi.
-I'm just trying to travel back in time.

56:45.613 --> 56:47.406
Back before I killed that guy.

Inmate for receiving, please.

57:29.532 --> 57:31.075
-Mr. Healy.
-Yeah?

57:32.910 --> 57:34.871
Did we travel back in time?

57:35.538 --> 57:36.748
No.

57:37.999 --> 57:39.626
Not this time.

57:41.711 --> 57:43.129
That's okay.

57:44.589 --> 57:46.132
We just keep trying.

57:46.633 --> 57:47.967
Yes.
