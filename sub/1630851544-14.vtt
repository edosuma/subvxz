WEBVTT

00:02.045 --> 00:03.220
<i>Previously on SWAT...</i><i>
What's that?</i>

00:03.264 --> 00:04.569
Eduardo Ortiz. He was arrested

00:04.613 --> 00:05.614
six years ago for
murdering a woman

00:05.657 --> 00:07.050
after she denied
his advances.

00:07.094 --> 00:08.878
You guys put me in here
for something I didn't do.

00:08.921 --> 00:11.272
<i>See, my lawyer
hasn't been answering my calls.</i>

00:11.315 --> 00:12.403
He took a plea deal, the terms

00:12.447 --> 00:14.101
of which explicitly
ruled out an appeal,

00:14.144 --> 00:15.102
and he knows that.

00:15.145 --> 00:16.842
This CI basically

00:16.886 --> 00:18.235
gave you a free
pass into SWAT.

00:18.279 --> 00:20.063
You look great, Ally.
Three years.

00:20.107 --> 00:22.718
Not one text.
Not even to ask how I'm doing.

00:22.761 --> 00:23.980
Let me guess.
Ex-girlfriend?

00:24.024 --> 00:26.069
Actually, no. Worked together

00:26.113 --> 00:28.071
<i>for nine months.</i> <i>
Got pretty close. We talked</i>

00:28.115 --> 00:29.594
<i>about being together after.</i><i>
And you left her hanging?</i>

00:29.638 --> 00:31.074
Seemed like it was for the best.

00:31.118 --> 00:32.075
I'm gonna finish this case,

00:32.119 --> 00:33.381
and then I'm gonna make up

00:33.424 --> 00:34.512
for the last three years, okay?

00:34.556 --> 00:36.471
Okay.

00:37.559 --> 00:39.735
<i>Sorry, Victor.</i> <i>
Nothing's ever gonna change.</i>

00:39.778 --> 00:41.650
<i>This time, I'm ditching you.</i>

01:01.626 --> 01:03.280
Nice job.
You're making progress.

01:03.324 --> 01:06.718
Well, still feels like I got a
ways to go. Look at your hits.

01:06.762 --> 01:07.893
I've been doing
this for a while,

01:07.937 --> 01:10.287
trust me. You just got
to get your reps in.

01:10.331 --> 01:11.723
You keep putting in
this practice,

01:11.767 --> 01:13.073
you're gonna blow
the other recruits away.

01:13.116 --> 01:14.161
Luca.

01:14.204 --> 01:16.032
I'm glad you came in early.

01:16.076 --> 01:17.294
Yeah, just getting
some range time

01:17.338 --> 01:19.079
before
- the warrant service later.
- About that.

01:19.122 --> 01:20.645
Part of my five-year review

01:20.689 --> 01:22.560
means I have a psych
eval with Dr. Hughes,

01:22.604 --> 01:24.127
so you're in my shoes
for the time being.

01:24.171 --> 01:26.695
I hope this isn't
some backdoor way

01:26.738 --> 01:28.697
to try to get me to reconsider
a leadership position

01:28.740 --> 01:30.177
- and start wearing a suit.
- It isn't.

01:30.220 --> 01:32.614
But the training cert
you got in Germany

01:32.657 --> 01:34.398
allows me to make you
interim boss when needed.

01:34.442 --> 01:36.052
- And you're needed.
- LUCA:Look,

01:36.096 --> 01:38.533
all due respect, I'd rather be
on the no-knock with my team,

01:38.576 --> 01:41.275
especially while we're down one
with Chris doing a patrol day.

01:41.318 --> 01:42.580
There'll be more warrants
to serve.

01:42.624 --> 01:44.104
You did Hondo's job
in the field.

01:44.147 --> 01:45.975
Now you have the chance
to do mine from HQ.

01:46.018 --> 01:48.325
And besides, if you decide
to go the leadership route,

01:48.369 --> 01:49.979
be a nice feather in your cap.

01:50.022 --> 01:51.415
Right. Copy that. Um,

01:51.459 --> 01:53.156
- how long's this arrangement for?
- Oh, don't let the power

01:53.200 --> 01:56.116
go to your head.
The psych eval should be quick.

01:56.159 --> 01:57.987
You may not be in charge
for more than an hour.

01:58.030 --> 01:59.902
Yeah, but... Ah! You're welcome.

02:02.948 --> 02:04.950
Look who's the
big shot now.

02:15.222 --> 02:18.529
Hey. Who's this, uh,
Eduardo Ortiz guy?

02:18.573 --> 02:20.140
He's nobody.
Writes you letters.

02:21.184 --> 02:23.012
You brought home his files.

02:23.055 --> 02:24.448
David.

02:24.492 --> 02:27.843
He's just a guy I arrested
a bunch of years ago.

02:27.886 --> 02:30.062
Uh, he joined
my prison ministry group.

02:30.106 --> 02:31.629
Claims he's innocent.

02:31.673 --> 02:34.502
So that's what's been
bothering you at night.

02:34.545 --> 02:36.634
Hey, I know when
you're tossing and turning.

02:38.288 --> 02:40.943
Do you believe him?
That he's innocent, I mean?

02:40.986 --> 02:42.423
Doesn't matter what I
believe. There's nothing

02:42.466 --> 02:43.641
I can do at this point.

02:43.685 --> 02:44.903
And he pled guilty,

02:44.947 --> 02:46.862
so he's not eligible
for an appeal.

02:46.905 --> 02:47.950
Because of a term of his deal?

02:47.993 --> 02:49.212
- Yeah.
- I left law school

02:49.256 --> 02:50.518
to raise four kids.
It doesn't mean

02:50.561 --> 02:52.781
- I forgot everything I learned.
- Thing is...

02:53.825 --> 02:55.349
What if he took the plea deal

02:55.392 --> 02:57.264
because he felt like
he didn't have a choice?

02:57.307 --> 02:59.048
Well, did you talk
- to his defense attorney?
- Yeah.

02:59.091 --> 03:00.658
Yeah. She's a
public defender.

03:00.702 --> 03:03.270
You know, she's well-meaning,
but she's overworked.

03:03.313 --> 03:04.662
She's probably had hundreds
of cases since then.

03:04.706 --> 03:06.621
Mm.

03:06.664 --> 03:09.624
Do you mind if I take a look
at this while you go to work?

03:09.667 --> 03:10.929
- Do you have time?
- Yeah.

03:10.973 --> 03:12.322
I think I can pull myself away

03:12.366 --> 03:13.889
from diaper duty
for a little while.

03:13.932 --> 03:15.673
Besides, why let

03:15.717 --> 03:17.066
half a law school degree
go to waste

03:17.109 --> 03:18.894
when I can put it to some use?

03:18.937 --> 03:20.330
Okay.

03:20.374 --> 03:21.766
- Okay.
- See you tonight.

03:21.810 --> 03:25.292
- All right. Love you.
- Love you.

03:46.356 --> 03:48.271
LAPD! Down on the ground!
Do it now!

03:50.099 --> 03:52.362
On your knees!

03:52.406 --> 03:54.756
Rabbit on the two. I got him.

04:00.283 --> 04:01.763
Aah! No!

04:03.025 --> 04:04.635
Stay down!
I said stay down.

04:04.679 --> 04:06.333
Luca, it's Hondo.

04:06.376 --> 04:08.160
Looks like we got
our three robbery suspects

04:08.204 --> 04:10.293
- and their getaway car.
- 30-
- David.

04:10.337 --> 04:12.295
We're moving to
- clear the warehouse.
Copy that,

04:12.339 --> 04:13.949
- 30-
- David.

04:17.779 --> 04:18.867
We got a rabbit. Go!

04:21.304 --> 04:22.523
Headed past the three side.

04:31.053 --> 04:32.924
Hands.
Give me your hands.

04:32.968 --> 04:35.710
- 25-
- David to D-Team. We hooked the rabbit.

04:35.753 --> 04:37.973
- 20-
- David to Command. We're Code 4.

04:38.016 --> 04:40.541
- Okay. Copy that, 20-
- David. Good work.

04:43.892 --> 04:45.285
You got to be kidding me.

04:45.328 --> 04:46.938
- What? You know her?
- Yeah. Ally.

04:46.982 --> 04:50.333
Was my informant. But she's
been off the grid for a while.

04:50.377 --> 04:52.596
Nice to see you, too, Victor.

04:58.385 --> 05:00.343
When the detective gets here,

05:00.387 --> 05:01.475
you'll be booked,
probably charged

05:01.518 --> 05:02.911
with aiding and abetting
a robbery crew,

05:02.954 --> 05:04.782
grand theft auto
and evading police.

05:04.826 --> 05:06.393
Well, you may not have
held up the bank yourself,

05:06.436 --> 05:07.959
but DA's gonna
come down on you hard

05:08.003 --> 05:08.960
for working
with those guys.

05:09.004 --> 05:10.440
Tell me everything now,

05:10.484 --> 05:12.007
maybe I can put
in a good word.

05:12.050 --> 05:14.270
Am I wrong
to expect a little more?

05:14.314 --> 05:16.054
For what? Burning me,

05:16.098 --> 05:17.839
then ghosting
four years ago?

05:17.882 --> 05:20.232
Wow, that got
under your skin.

05:20.276 --> 05:21.973
Figured
you would've moved on.

05:22.017 --> 05:24.802
I have, trust me. Sad thing
is, seems like you haven't.

05:24.846 --> 05:27.544
Still in the same game, stealing
cars for smash-and-grabs,

05:27.588 --> 05:28.850
selling the stripped
parts for cash.

05:28.893 --> 05:31.374
What can I say?
It pays well.

05:31.418 --> 05:33.376
Oh, yeah? What
happened to the 140 K

05:33.420 --> 05:35.247
you ran off with the
last time I saw you?

05:35.291 --> 05:36.814
Expenses.

05:36.858 --> 05:38.773
Cash goes quick in SoCal.

05:38.816 --> 05:42.385
So does the novelty
of being on the run.

05:42.429 --> 05:45.910
Look, if you're feeling bummed
'cause you couldn't save me,

05:45.954 --> 05:47.608
guess what?

05:47.651 --> 05:49.958
I didn't need saving.
Still don't.

05:50.001 --> 05:51.655
Well, looks like you do.

05:51.699 --> 05:53.265
After everything
we had been through,

05:53.309 --> 05:54.702
guess I just hoped
you'd done better,

05:54.745 --> 05:56.617
gotten yourself straight.

05:56.660 --> 05:58.488
How?

05:58.532 --> 06:01.448
With a prior record?
My only other work experience

06:01.491 --> 06:03.275
being an off-the-books informant
for a cop?

06:03.319 --> 06:04.407
You could've tried, Ally.

06:04.451 --> 06:06.104
Don't take this the wrong way,

06:06.148 --> 06:07.889
but after the last case
we worked,

06:07.932 --> 06:11.153
I realized that domestic life
wasn't for me.

06:12.154 --> 06:14.635
- Or for you, I guess.
- Wrong again.

06:15.679 --> 06:17.855
I'm married now.

06:17.899 --> 06:20.031
Good for you.

06:20.075 --> 06:22.033
Well, it's been
nice catching up.

06:22.077 --> 06:24.819
I'll let you know when
the detective gets here.

06:24.862 --> 06:27.648
Okay, listen.

06:27.691 --> 06:29.519
I don't want
to do any prison time.

06:29.563 --> 06:31.086
Well, I thought you
didn't need saving.

06:31.129 --> 06:34.089
You're not exactly in a
great position to bargain.

06:34.132 --> 06:35.743
I haven't told you what I know.

06:35.786 --> 06:39.311
About a different operation
and a way bigger fish

06:39.355 --> 06:41.357
you guys would kill
- to get your hands on.
- Okay.

06:41.401 --> 06:43.141
- Hit me with it, then.
- I'd rather

06:43.185 --> 06:45.448
just tell the detective,
if it's all the same.

06:45.492 --> 06:49.409
Thing I'm into,
it's too dangerous for you.

06:50.671 --> 06:52.020
You got the little missus
to worry about now.

06:52.063 --> 06:53.456
Your risk-taking days are over.

06:53.500 --> 06:55.719
Yeah, I'll decide
what's too risky.

06:55.763 --> 06:57.417
Thanks.

06:59.375 --> 07:01.116
What if I told you

07:01.159 --> 07:03.814
I'm looped into the biggest
opioid ring in Los Angeles?

07:03.858 --> 07:06.687
I would say you're full of crap
or working an angle or both.

07:08.428 --> 07:10.299
Oh, it's true.

07:10.342 --> 07:12.040
And I'm gonna help you
take them down.

07:12.083 --> 07:13.737
That is,

07:13.781 --> 07:16.218
if you're man enough
to handle it.

07:58.565 --> 08:00.175
Dr. Hughes?
I have my performance review

08:00.218 --> 08:02.133
signed by the chief's office.
I filled out

08:02.177 --> 08:03.395
the psych eval paperwork.

08:03.439 --> 08:06.355
Same questions
as five years ago, if I recall.

08:06.398 --> 08:08.226
So you can just sign the form,
and I'll get out of your hair.

08:08.270 --> 08:10.838
Not so fast.
You canceled your meeting

08:10.881 --> 08:13.318
with a CalPERS rep last week.

08:13.362 --> 08:14.972
I don't need some pencil pusher
from city hall

08:15.016 --> 08:17.714
telling me what my pension
and health benefits look like.

08:17.758 --> 08:20.195
It was a courtesy meeting
to go over your options.

08:20.238 --> 08:22.589
- Well, retirement isn't one.
- No one's

08:22.632 --> 08:23.981
trying to sell you on that.

08:24.025 --> 08:26.157
Oh. Glad we got that cleared up.

08:26.201 --> 08:28.595
You told the rep that you didn't
have time for the meeting.

08:28.638 --> 08:32.337
That could be because
you're working every day,

08:32.381 --> 08:34.122
- all hours.
- I can't control

08:34.165 --> 08:36.559
when the bad guys
choose to terrorize the city.

08:36.603 --> 08:39.040
That's a funny line.
I remember thinking it was funny

08:39.083 --> 08:41.433
the last time you told that
to me five years ago.

08:41.477 --> 08:42.609
I signed off on you

08:42.652 --> 08:44.175
last time
'cause you made me a promise.

08:44.219 --> 08:46.613
You said that you would
take better care of yourself.

08:46.656 --> 08:49.180
You haven't taken
a single day off

08:49.224 --> 08:51.922
since Barb died,
and that was nine years ago.

08:51.966 --> 08:54.011
There's something deeper
going on here.

08:54.055 --> 08:56.057
Why don't we talk about it?

08:56.100 --> 08:58.233
No offense, Doc, but...

08:58.276 --> 09:00.757
this kind of thing,
- it isn't for me.
- Yet you recommend it

09:00.801 --> 09:02.933
- to your team members.
- Well, it's necessary for them.

09:02.977 --> 09:04.587
They're in the
field every day.

09:04.631 --> 09:07.459
I'm just a... you know,
a glorified desk jockey now.

09:07.503 --> 09:10.245
I don't...
- I don't need a head shrink.
- Well,

09:10.288 --> 09:13.335
since I have to sign off on you
for you to go back to Command,

09:13.378 --> 09:16.207
why don't you let me be
the judge of what you need?

09:16.251 --> 09:17.469
Hmm.

09:23.432 --> 09:25.782
Ms. Donovan,
if you have information

09:25.826 --> 09:28.524
that ties to a drug operation,
then give us the whole picture.

09:28.568 --> 09:32.049
Then maybe we can see about
getting your charges reduced.

09:32.093 --> 09:35.923
Sure. I understand.

09:35.966 --> 09:39.579
I've been trying to get out
of the stolen car hustle.

09:39.622 --> 09:42.233
I got my own shop
where I modify rides,

09:42.277 --> 09:43.844
do special body kits

09:43.887 --> 09:46.020
with false bottoms
and hidden stash compartments.

09:46.063 --> 09:48.588
So, you supply cars
to help smuggle drugs?

09:49.632 --> 09:51.286
For who, exactly?
The last year, mostly a guy

09:51.329 --> 09:53.462
named Miles and his crew.

09:53.505 --> 09:56.334
I'm supposed to deliver an SUV
to him later today.

09:56.378 --> 09:58.728
For free this time.

09:58.772 --> 09:59.947
Why free? What's the catch?

09:59.990 --> 10:02.558
He is gonna hook me
into his operation,

10:02.602 --> 10:04.212
get me in the game

10:04.255 --> 10:06.040
working for a guy
they call The King.

10:07.781 --> 10:08.912
You know
who she's talking about?

10:08.956 --> 10:10.479
Damn right, he knows.

10:10.522 --> 10:11.959
Alias for the leader

10:12.002 --> 10:14.396
of the biggest synthetic opioid
operation in SoCal.

10:14.439 --> 10:17.660
He's responsible for the product
known as Devil Dust.

10:17.704 --> 10:19.314
That's linked to a ton
of overdose deaths.

10:19.357 --> 10:22.099
As well as countless homicides
trying to get ahold of it.

10:22.143 --> 10:23.753
The DEA and FBI

10:23.797 --> 10:25.886
have been trying to crack
this guy's ground game

10:25.929 --> 10:27.975
ever since his product
- first hit the streets.
I'm guessing,

10:28.018 --> 10:30.107
then, no one's come close
to finding a lab

10:30.151 --> 10:32.109
or IDing The King himself?

10:32.153 --> 10:33.894
No.

10:33.937 --> 10:36.287
Not yet. Oh.

10:36.331 --> 10:37.375
I guess that's where I come in.

10:37.419 --> 10:38.681
You're welcome, guys.

10:38.725 --> 10:40.770
Where are you supposed
to deliver the SUV today?

10:40.814 --> 10:44.600
First, I want assurances.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.733
For this intel, I'll take
whatever snitch jacket you got,

10:46.776 --> 10:48.648
but I am not doing one hour
in jail.

10:48.691 --> 10:51.694
You know, usually
when we cultivate informants,

10:51.738 --> 10:53.740
we set the terms. Mm.

10:53.783 --> 10:56.003
For intel on The King,

10:56.046 --> 10:58.745
I think you'll want
to make an exception.

10:58.788 --> 11:01.138
You trust her?

11:01.182 --> 11:02.923
I trust her information.

11:02.966 --> 11:05.360
My gut tells me
it's worth chasing down.

11:05.403 --> 11:07.231
What's the story
between you two?

11:07.275 --> 11:08.929
She was my informant on Vice.

11:08.972 --> 11:12.367
Then we worked a SWAT case,
the Trocadero copycats,

11:12.410 --> 11:14.238
four years back.

11:14.282 --> 11:16.719
And that's everything?

11:16.763 --> 11:19.722
It was complicated,
but she owned good sources.

11:19.766 --> 11:21.115
Her intel always held up.

11:24.205 --> 11:26.120
Hey, honey. Everything okay?
Yeah.

11:26.163 --> 11:27.904
I actually just met up
with a friend from law school.

11:27.948 --> 11:29.253
She knows the investigator

11:29.297 --> 11:30.994
who worked
on Ortiz's defense counsel.

11:31.038 --> 11:32.213
You find out
anything interesting?

11:32.256 --> 11:33.736
Maybe.

11:33.780 --> 11:34.911
He always claimed
that he had an alibi

11:34.955 --> 11:36.565
for the night of the murder,
a woman

11:36.608 --> 11:38.219
who could place him across town. Right.

11:38.262 --> 11:39.611
But the defense
could never produce her.

11:39.655 --> 11:41.222
Because, at the time,
they couldn't find her.

11:41.265 --> 11:43.398
Let me guess.
You tracked her down?

11:43.441 --> 11:45.617
Yeah. Her name is Kim Wagner,

11:45.661 --> 11:47.532
and she works at a bakery
in Mar Vista.

11:47.576 --> 11:49.796
So, I'm gonna head over
and see what her story is.

11:49.839 --> 11:51.623
You sure? Why don't you
just send me her info?

11:51.667 --> 11:52.929
I can head over after my shift.

11:52.973 --> 11:54.539
No, I-I want to do this.

11:54.583 --> 11:55.889
And it might shed some light
on whether Ortiz

11:55.932 --> 11:57.020
is telling the truth or not.

11:58.108 --> 11:59.893
You're really enjoying this,
aren't you?

11:59.936 --> 12:01.764
Yeah. Yeah, I guess I am.

12:01.808 --> 12:04.071
I hope that's okay?
Yeah. No, no, it's good.

12:04.114 --> 12:05.855
This is worth looking into.

12:05.899 --> 12:07.770
If you need anything,
- you just let me know. Okay.

12:07.814 --> 12:09.903
Love you.
Love you, too.

12:10.947 --> 12:12.949
Hey. DA's office
is authorizing us

12:12.993 --> 12:14.037
to make a deal
with your informant.

12:14.081 --> 12:15.909
If Ally can get us to The King,

12:15.952 --> 12:17.780
it represents the biggest break
in the case to date.

12:17.824 --> 12:19.086
In one hour,

12:19.129 --> 12:20.652
she's supposed to
deliver a modified SUV

12:20.696 --> 12:22.611
to her buyer,
Miles Bassett.

12:22.654 --> 12:23.830
STREET:Well, the guy's
got a nice jacket.

12:23.873 --> 12:25.092
Two counts of
aggravated assault

12:25.135 --> 12:26.963
and an outstanding
bench warrant

12:27.007 --> 12:28.835
for domestic battery.
All right. So, we work

12:28.878 --> 12:31.446
the deal. Arrest Miles, flip
him, make him work for us.

12:31.489 --> 12:33.317
Then we're all one step
closer to The King

12:33.361 --> 12:35.189
and taking his product
off the streets.

12:35.232 --> 12:36.407
By "working the deal," you mean

12:36.451 --> 12:37.931
putting your CI
with us out in the field?

12:37.974 --> 12:40.063
This Miles guy's dangerous,
and he could be bringing help.

12:40.107 --> 12:41.630
And there might be
other variables, too,

12:41.673 --> 12:43.458
and we don't have a lot
- of prep time with Ally.
- Look,

12:43.501 --> 12:45.155
Ally and I worked together
in the field before.

12:45.199 --> 12:47.418
Just like the busts
we used to do back in Vice.

12:47.462 --> 12:49.464
Where's Commander Hicks?
He's still in his five-year review.

12:49.507 --> 12:51.118
Don't know how much longer. No,

12:51.161 --> 12:52.946
we don't have time to wait
for Hicks. We can put

12:52.989 --> 12:54.948
a game plan in motion right now,
but, Luca, you got to give us

12:54.991 --> 12:56.993
the green light. It's your call.

13:01.781 --> 13:02.869
All right. Let's do it.

13:05.523 --> 13:07.351
Congratulations.
You reclaimed

13:07.395 --> 13:08.831
your CI status.

13:10.746 --> 13:11.834
We got work to do.

13:15.229 --> 13:17.927
My guys will stake
out the delivery.

13:17.971 --> 13:19.494
You'll ID Miles.

13:19.537 --> 13:20.538
- And then 20-
- Squad will swoop in.

13:20.582 --> 13:23.672
Mm. Sort of like old times.

13:25.195 --> 13:26.762
Who's working the sting
- for your team?
- I am.

13:26.806 --> 13:28.459
- With Street.
- No, hold up.

13:29.896 --> 13:32.855
Maybe I was egging you
on before, but trust me,

13:32.899 --> 13:34.857
- you don't want any part of this.
- You think

13:34.901 --> 13:36.554
you're trying to protect me
or something? I'm SWAT.

13:36.598 --> 13:38.078
I train for this every day.

13:38.121 --> 13:39.731
Sounds like something
a practice player would say.

13:39.775 --> 13:41.864
Street and I will be
in the back of a semi

13:41.908 --> 13:44.084
at the truck stop with eyes
on you the entire time.

13:44.127 --> 13:45.781
We'll wait for your signal.

13:45.825 --> 13:47.304
Assuming you remember the one

13:47.348 --> 13:48.740
- we used to use?
- Take off my hat,

13:48.784 --> 13:50.264
- wipe my brow.
- We got bird's-eye photos

13:50.307 --> 13:51.874
of the truck stop.
I'll run you through

13:51.918 --> 13:53.049
where the rest of the team
will be

13:53.093 --> 13:54.746
in case we need a Plan B.

13:54.790 --> 13:57.793
- Your wife know about us?
- No.

13:57.837 --> 13:59.360
You and I were ancient history
by the time I met her.

13:59.403 --> 14:01.318
- What's it matter?
- Well, just wondering what she thinks

14:01.362 --> 14:04.060
about you throwing yourself
into dangerous situations.

14:04.104 --> 14:06.584
She's seen up close
- how I handle things.
- Yeah?

14:06.628 --> 14:07.759
Just want to make sure

14:07.803 --> 14:08.891
you're not getting soft
in your old age.

14:08.935 --> 14:11.415
Let's get to work, Ally.

14:11.459 --> 14:12.852
You're forgetting something.

14:15.463 --> 14:17.465
I'm gonna need a hat.

14:20.511 --> 14:22.209
Are you getting
enough sleep?

14:22.252 --> 14:23.645
I sleep fine at night.

14:23.688 --> 14:25.038
How many hours are we talking?

14:25.081 --> 14:26.604
I don't need much shut-eye.

14:26.648 --> 14:29.912
Mm. Well, if your log times
are any indication

14:29.956 --> 14:32.697
and judging
from your turnaround times,

14:32.741 --> 14:35.657
I would say that you are
only allowing yourself

14:35.700 --> 14:37.093
five hours of sleep.

14:37.137 --> 14:39.226
That's a conscious decision. Mm.

14:39.269 --> 14:41.881
Explain that to me.

14:45.493 --> 14:46.929
Uh...

14:46.973 --> 14:48.713
I don't know if you
remember Barb all that well.

14:48.757 --> 14:51.064
Of course I do.
She could talk your ear off.

14:51.107 --> 14:53.588
She was a good listener, too.

14:53.631 --> 14:57.548
Every time I'd come home
after a shift at night,

14:57.592 --> 14:59.811
she could always tell
when it was a rough one.

14:59.855 --> 15:01.988
You know, see it on my face.

15:02.031 --> 15:05.643
She'd leave me alone for a bit, and...

15:07.341 --> 15:09.299
Sometimes, we ate in silence.

15:09.343 --> 15:10.822
And later on

15:10.866 --> 15:13.521
that night, we'd go to bed.

15:13.564 --> 15:16.393
She'd shut out the lights

15:16.437 --> 15:19.440
and get me to talk
about the day.

15:20.484 --> 15:21.964
She would hold my hand,

15:22.008 --> 15:23.748
and...

15:23.792 --> 15:26.142
somehow, like magic,

15:26.186 --> 15:28.928
after getting all that
off my chest,

15:28.971 --> 15:30.930
I'd drift off to sleep.

15:32.540 --> 15:35.499
Like a baby.

15:36.587 --> 15:38.546
And you haven't had that
for nine years,

15:38.589 --> 15:41.244
so you work until you collapse.

15:41.288 --> 15:42.985
And then the alarm goes off

15:43.029 --> 15:45.031
and I get up and do it
all over again.

15:45.074 --> 15:46.206
Well, that's not
very healthy, Robert.

15:46.249 --> 15:48.556
Duly noted.

15:48.599 --> 15:49.992
We can agree on that.

15:50.036 --> 15:51.298
Mm.

15:51.341 --> 15:53.604
But that's what the job entails.

15:54.562 --> 15:56.129
Can you sign the form now?

15:56.172 --> 15:57.652
No. Have a seat.

15:57.695 --> 15:59.393
We're just getting started.

15:59.436 --> 16:02.265
Uh, bathroom breaks
are allowed, right?

16:02.309 --> 16:04.615
Sure. Whatever you need.

16:05.703 --> 16:08.532
All right. I'll be back.

16:22.155 --> 16:23.591
Buyer's late, it happens.

16:23.634 --> 16:24.940
Don't get antsy.

16:24.984 --> 16:26.855
You worked stakeouts on Vice.

16:26.898 --> 16:28.465
Although I get
it's been a minute.

16:28.509 --> 16:29.684
Hey, I'm dialed in, all right?
I'm ready to go.

16:29.727 --> 16:30.815
Anyone else besides me

16:30.859 --> 16:32.687
know your history with her?

16:32.730 --> 16:34.080
Not that part of it, no.

16:34.123 --> 16:36.430
<i>I had a buddy</i> <i>
down in Long Beach.</i>

16:36.473 --> 16:38.040
<i>He helped an informant stay</i> <i>
out of trouble, too.</i>

16:38.084 --> 16:40.912
She had him all
twisted, though.

16:40.956 --> 16:43.219
I'm just saying, she used
his insecurities against him,

16:43.263 --> 16:45.221
pushed him to make
sketchy calls...

16:45.265 --> 16:46.788
I'm not helping her
stay out of trouble.

16:46.831 --> 16:49.051
She's helping us
- with information.
- Okay.

16:49.095 --> 16:50.618
- 25-
- David to D-Team.

16:50.661 --> 16:51.662
Buyer's on site.

16:51.706 --> 16:52.881
Roger that.

16:52.924 --> 16:54.883
I don't have eyes
into the car from here.

16:56.189 --> 16:58.017
Yeah, the windows
got a heavy tint to them.

17:00.541 --> 17:02.151
Hey, Miles.

17:02.195 --> 17:04.371
Sup?

17:09.376 --> 17:11.117
Didn't know you were
bringing muscle this time.

17:11.160 --> 17:12.901
- 25-
- David to D-Team.

17:12.944 --> 17:14.555
Sounds like Miles brought
an enforcer with him.

17:14.598 --> 17:15.817
Do we need to step in here?

17:15.860 --> 17:17.210
Yeah, this is my
bodyguard Jackson.

17:17.253 --> 17:19.734
- Mm.
- Don't worry, I play nice.

17:19.777 --> 17:21.040
- Most of the time.
- Sure you do.

17:23.259 --> 17:24.434
So, we doing this?

17:24.478 --> 17:26.349
- 25-
- David to D-Team, we're still good.

17:26.393 --> 17:27.742
Ally knows when
to call something off,

17:27.785 --> 17:30.049
Street and I can
handle this ourselves.

17:31.267 --> 17:32.790
Hey, Hondo,
I'm switching us to two.

17:34.357 --> 17:36.272
What's going on with Tan?
He's usually the cautious one.

17:36.316 --> 17:37.491
Yeah, he's going out of his way

17:37.534 --> 17:39.101
to put more pressure
on the situation.

17:39.145 --> 17:40.842
I think he's trying
to prove something.

17:40.885 --> 17:42.844
To us? Why?

17:42.887 --> 17:45.455
No, to himself. Or to her.

17:45.499 --> 17:46.761
Hop in.
What for?

17:46.804 --> 17:48.632
Supposed to be show-and-tell
like usual, right?

17:48.676 --> 17:50.330
I trust the car is up to snuff.

17:50.373 --> 17:52.332
But if I'm taking you
to my source this time,

17:52.375 --> 17:54.508
I'm not letting you out of my
sight until the meetup's done.

17:54.551 --> 17:56.945
I'm sure
you understand.

17:58.338 --> 18:00.209
Why don't you get
in the back seat?

18:01.819 --> 18:03.865
Thought you said you play nice.

18:03.908 --> 18:06.389
Most of the time. Not always.

18:11.916 --> 18:13.048
Let's move.

18:13.092 --> 18:15.050
Where you going?
I said get in the car.

18:15.094 --> 18:16.530
Police!
Don't move!

18:22.405 --> 18:24.451
LAPD! Show me your hands!

18:26.192 --> 18:27.932
Show me your hands!
Show me your hands!

18:29.891 --> 18:32.546
Hands on the car.
Hands behind your back.

18:32.589 --> 18:34.200
Hands on your head!

18:34.243 --> 18:35.244
Interlace your fingers.

18:35.288 --> 18:36.898
LAPD.

18:36.941 --> 18:38.073
You're under arrest.

18:38.117 --> 18:39.814
Turn around. Turn around!

18:39.857 --> 18:41.207
Deac.

18:43.731 --> 18:45.080
You are in his head.

18:45.124 --> 18:46.125
Rent-free, I guess.

18:47.735 --> 18:50.259
Street, you got
- these guys covered?
- Yeah.

18:50.303 --> 18:52.174
Tan, with me, now.

18:52.218 --> 18:53.175
Now.

18:54.655 --> 18:56.135
All right, real talk.

18:56.178 --> 18:57.919
What's the deal between you
and this girl right here?

18:59.007 --> 19:00.313
We got close, back in the day.

19:00.356 --> 19:01.705
Oh, okay, so you actually
crossed the line

19:01.749 --> 19:02.924
with your CI before.

19:02.967 --> 19:03.838
That explains why
she has you wrapped around

19:03.881 --> 19:04.839
her finger right now.

19:04.882 --> 19:06.232
No, she doesn't.

19:06.275 --> 19:08.190
Oh, really? Because that
wasn't textbook, Tan.

19:08.234 --> 19:10.410
I'll give you that was
a good collar, but protocol

19:10.453 --> 19:12.455
is about limiting risk,
not taking on more of it

19:12.499 --> 19:13.674
and endangering yourself.

19:13.717 --> 19:15.502
I got the job done, Hondo.

19:15.545 --> 19:16.851
You want to prove
to yourself or anyone else

19:16.894 --> 19:18.722
you can still improvise
in high-risk situations,

19:18.766 --> 19:20.550
then you take that
back to Vice.

19:20.594 --> 19:23.466
Because you know damn well that
- belongs nowhere near 20-
- Squad.

19:24.467 --> 19:26.948
So we're clear,

19:26.991 --> 19:29.124
is she gonna be an problem
for you going forward?

19:30.212 --> 19:31.387
No.

19:31.431 --> 19:32.910
You make sure
of that.

19:32.954 --> 19:34.912
Or I will.

19:39.178 --> 19:41.005
Let's get them
out of here.

19:55.019 --> 19:56.412
WENDY:That's the mother of
all bathroom breaks.

19:56.456 --> 19:58.197
You're really
doing this?

19:58.240 --> 20:00.547
You're stalking me now?

20:00.590 --> 20:01.200
Because you're avoiding me.

20:01.243 --> 20:02.244
For God's sakes,

20:02.288 --> 20:03.637
I need to run a SWAT operation.

20:03.680 --> 20:06.466
Luca will have to do your job
until I sign off on you.

20:06.509 --> 20:09.469
What's it gonna take, Doc?

20:09.512 --> 20:12.080
To make decisions that have
life-and-death consequences

20:12.123 --> 20:15.649
for the people in this building
and the citizens of this city,

20:15.692 --> 20:17.390
I need to put in
what the job requires.

20:17.433 --> 20:20.915
It doesn't require you running
- yourself into the ground.
- Well...

20:20.958 --> 20:23.700
You used to take days off,
and, I'm assuming, slept.

20:23.744 --> 20:24.919
But life changes.

20:24.962 --> 20:26.703
And we got to roll
with the punches.

20:26.747 --> 20:28.139
Now I need to get out there

20:28.183 --> 20:29.750
and do my job. No.

20:29.793 --> 20:32.927
You need to start taking time
for yourself.

20:32.970 --> 20:34.015
For what, exactly?

20:34.058 --> 20:35.408
You suffered an incredible loss

20:35.451 --> 20:36.539
when Barb passed away

20:36.583 --> 20:37.584
- back then.
- Oh...

20:37.627 --> 20:39.629
I want you to stop
using this job

20:39.673 --> 20:40.891
to fill that void.

20:43.590 --> 20:47.202
I don't feel overworked,
Dr. Hughes.

20:47.246 --> 20:48.986
You can speak
with the chief's office.

20:49.030 --> 20:51.641
My performance review
speaks for itself.

20:51.685 --> 20:53.513
But that's only part
of the equation.

20:53.556 --> 20:56.603
You need to learn
how to disconnect from work.

20:56.646 --> 21:00.650
It will benefit your health
and your ability to do the job.

21:00.694 --> 21:02.565
You can't continue
on like this

21:02.609 --> 21:04.306
and you know it.

21:04.350 --> 21:08.005
Now, come back to my office

21:08.049 --> 21:11.139
and have a seat, please.

21:12.836 --> 21:15.361
I told you, I prefer to stand.

21:17.188 --> 21:18.973
Pretty sure you know
how this goes, Miles.

21:19.016 --> 21:20.627
We already got you on
an outstanding warrant

21:20.670 --> 21:22.846
for domestic battery,
and that's before we talk about

21:22.890 --> 21:24.413
the illicit drug operation

21:24.457 --> 21:26.328
you and your muscle
are knee-deep in.

21:26.372 --> 21:28.156
But let's face it, neither one
of you is who we're after.

21:28.199 --> 21:29.592
We want your source.

21:29.636 --> 21:30.767
Ultimately, we want The King.

21:30.811 --> 21:32.203
Be smart and work with us.

21:32.247 --> 21:34.031
The other option
is two hots and a cot.

21:34.075 --> 21:35.555
Fine.

21:35.598 --> 21:38.340
But look,
if I'm gonna help you, man,

21:38.384 --> 21:41.038
I'm not going
to jail, okay?

21:41.082 --> 21:42.170
Where have I heard that before?

21:42.213 --> 21:43.214
Look,

21:43.258 --> 21:44.781
my sister needs me.

21:44.825 --> 21:46.174
I can't do the time, man.

21:46.217 --> 21:47.741
Then start sharing.

21:47.784 --> 21:49.873
Every word is gonna help dig you
out of the hole you're in.

21:54.661 --> 21:57.446
All right, this is the deal.

21:57.490 --> 22:00.319
I wasn't gonna meet up
with my usual source today.

22:00.362 --> 22:02.582
I was gonna pick up
another haul, but this time,

22:02.625 --> 22:04.540
I was actually gonna get
a face-to-face

22:04.584 --> 22:05.802
with The King himself.

22:07.848 --> 22:09.284
Word on the street
is he doesn't do meetups

22:09.328 --> 22:11.155
with runners or button men.

22:11.199 --> 22:13.332
That's why he's been
so elusive, and hard to ID.

22:13.375 --> 22:14.985
I don't even know
what he looks like.

22:15.029 --> 22:17.727
It's go-betweens
I've been doing business with.

22:17.771 --> 22:20.643
But I figure I've been
running his product so well

22:20.687 --> 22:22.950
these last three years, he was
calling me down from Fresno

22:22.993 --> 22:24.517
to talk expansion.

22:24.560 --> 22:26.562
Just so I've got this straight,
you were set to meet up

22:26.606 --> 22:28.477
with The King himself today?

22:28.521 --> 22:29.870
That's why I brought muscle.

22:29.913 --> 22:32.002
I was gonna bring
my new business partner, too.

22:32.046 --> 22:33.395
But I'm guessing
Ally ratted me out.

22:33.439 --> 22:35.397
That's why I'm in here
with y'all, right?

22:35.441 --> 22:38.008
Damn, I shouldn't
have trusted her ass.

22:40.359 --> 22:41.534
If our guys in custody
were gonna meet

22:41.577 --> 22:43.187
with The King in person,

22:43.231 --> 22:45.102
that means we got a chance to
ID and take him down today.

22:45.146 --> 22:47.278
It's an opportunity
nobody's had in years, Luca,

22:47.322 --> 22:49.542
since The King's product first
started hitting the streets.

22:49.585 --> 22:50.978
Yeah, but the meetup
in Pacoima's supposed to be

22:51.021 --> 22:52.980
in two hours, which doesn't
leave us many options.

22:53.023 --> 22:54.285
Just one.
Miles has never met

22:54.329 --> 22:55.548
The King in person.

22:55.591 --> 22:57.071
It's only been phone calls
and text messages.

22:57.114 --> 22:58.899
So The King doesn't know
what he looks like, either.

22:58.942 --> 23:00.509
Or his muscle.

23:00.553 --> 23:02.163
Modern-day barons and kingpins
run their operations this way

23:02.206 --> 23:03.991
to keep from getting ID'd
with surveillance.

23:04.034 --> 23:07.603
It's usually a smart play, but
it's got one obvious weakness.

23:07.647 --> 23:09.562
One you'd like to exploit.
You want to go undercover

23:09.605 --> 23:10.911
posing as these two dudes
at the meet.

23:10.954 --> 23:12.129
With Ally.

23:12.173 --> 23:13.609
The King's expecting
a party of three.

23:13.653 --> 23:15.132
You're in command.

23:15.176 --> 23:17.004
I'll run the operation,
but it's still your call.

23:17.047 --> 23:18.135
And you're buying into this?

23:18.179 --> 23:20.181
Tan's right about
the opportunity.

23:20.224 --> 23:21.400
We might not get another chance
to bring this guy down.

23:21.443 --> 23:22.401
I don't know

23:22.444 --> 23:24.664
about this plan, guys.

23:24.707 --> 23:26.187
I'm the one that's got
to face up to Hicks

23:26.230 --> 23:27.580
when this is all said and done.

23:27.623 --> 23:30.583
It's no different than
being in the field, man.

23:30.626 --> 23:34.021
We just got to trust each other.
To do things the right way.

23:37.590 --> 23:38.895
Okay. Let's put this in motion.

23:39.940 --> 23:41.071
All right.

23:42.159 --> 23:43.509
Hey, Fowler, hold up, hold up.

23:43.552 --> 23:45.162
I got two of our guys
going undercover

23:45.206 --> 23:46.642
and I want you out there
with them on this.

23:46.686 --> 23:49.993
I, uh, I don't typically
roll out with UCs or stings.

23:50.037 --> 23:52.474
- What's the deal?
- There's a lot going on, could get dangerous.

23:52.518 --> 23:54.476
I want a TEMS officer there.

23:54.520 --> 23:55.651
In case it goes bad.

23:55.695 --> 23:56.652
Look, it'll be a chance
for you to catch

23:56.696 --> 23:58.437
what real SWAT's like, up close,

23:58.480 --> 24:00.613
- if you're game.
- Of course. Count me in.

24:00.656 --> 24:02.658
Okay, check in with Hondo,
he'll run you through the op.

24:02.702 --> 24:03.833
Okay?

24:10.492 --> 24:11.841
Kim Wagner?

24:11.885 --> 24:14.365
I'm Annie Kay.

24:14.409 --> 24:15.628
Thanks for meeting with me.

24:15.671 --> 24:17.891
A cop's wife
coming to talk to me.

24:17.934 --> 24:20.197
Probably means
I'm not in trouble, right?

24:20.241 --> 24:22.243
You're not.

24:22.286 --> 24:25.202
I was just hoping that I could
talk to you about Eduardo Ortiz?

24:31.513 --> 24:32.862
It was rough
what happened to him,

24:32.906 --> 24:34.516
getting locked up
like that.

24:34.560 --> 24:36.736
We were just friends.

24:36.779 --> 24:38.172
Hung out from time to time.

24:38.215 --> 24:39.173
Look, I know

24:39.216 --> 24:42.132
it was six years ago...

24:42.176 --> 24:43.743
but he claimed
that he was with you

24:43.786 --> 24:45.440
the night of Maria Lozano's
murder.

24:45.484 --> 24:47.703
And that you could place him
somewhere else that night.

24:47.747 --> 24:49.792
Do you remember
that evening, or...?

24:49.836 --> 24:51.011
Like you said,

24:51.054 --> 24:52.665
six years.

24:52.708 --> 24:53.970
That's a long time ago.

24:54.014 --> 24:55.189
Look, I knowyou had

24:55.232 --> 24:57.234
you had a different life
back then.

24:57.278 --> 25:01.064
Two felonies for possession
with intent to distribute.

25:01.108 --> 25:03.240
My husband's guess is that
Ortiz might have been trying

25:03.284 --> 25:06.069
to score drugs
- from you that night.
- Right. Well,

25:06.113 --> 25:08.419
let's say you're
in the ballpark.

25:08.463 --> 25:10.552
Then you get why I couldn't
come forward six years ago.

25:10.596 --> 25:12.685
Because going on record
as Ortiz's alibi

25:12.728 --> 25:13.903
would've incriminated you.

25:13.947 --> 25:18.255
I had to look out for me,
you know?

25:18.299 --> 25:20.519
I feel bad he got locked up,
but what was I gonna do?

25:20.562 --> 25:22.521
I would've just been
trading places with him.

25:24.697 --> 25:26.786
You know, the statute
of limitations is up

25:26.829 --> 25:29.136
on what you might've done
six years ago,

25:29.179 --> 25:32.139
so coming forward now
won't get you in trouble.

25:32.182 --> 25:35.621
Uh, what's your deal, lady?
What do you want from me?

25:35.664 --> 25:37.100
If the truth really backs
his alibi, then I think

25:37.144 --> 25:39.581
it's time you get on the record,
make a statement.

25:39.625 --> 25:41.365
Then what happens?

25:41.409 --> 25:44.064
I'm not a lawyer,
so I can't say for certain,

25:44.107 --> 25:46.762
but I do know that you'll have
done right by Ortiz.

25:47.850 --> 25:50.723
Is that what you're here for?

25:50.766 --> 25:52.942
'Cause you and your husband
want to do right by Eddie?

25:52.986 --> 25:56.859
Seems like a pretty good
reason to me.

25:56.903 --> 25:58.339
Don't you think?

26:00.646 --> 26:01.995
Tan.

26:02.038 --> 26:04.258
Back on Vice,

26:04.301 --> 26:06.260
were you always this
eager to go undercover?

26:06.303 --> 26:07.914
I was, yeah.

26:07.957 --> 26:10.307
Part of me
still misses the work.

26:10.351 --> 26:11.700
Coming up through the ranks,

26:11.744 --> 26:13.180
I always had to go
the extra mile,

26:13.223 --> 26:15.965
prove to everyone
I could handle anything.

26:16.009 --> 26:18.577
Best way to stand out meant
embracing the danger.

26:18.620 --> 26:19.752
At a certain point, I realized

26:19.795 --> 26:21.014
I liked it
and wanted more of it.

26:22.668 --> 26:24.147
But that ain't
who you are now.

26:24.191 --> 26:25.932
SWAT trained the bad habits
out of you.

26:25.975 --> 26:28.325
I thought so, but Ally...

26:28.369 --> 26:29.892
still knows
how to get in my head,

26:29.936 --> 26:31.894
make me think
there's more to prove.

26:31.938 --> 26:33.374
She knows how to push the right
buttons because she likes

26:33.417 --> 26:34.854
- taking risks, too.
- Probably why

26:34.897 --> 26:36.420
we made such a good team
back in the day.

26:36.464 --> 26:38.379
Okay. But who you
were back then,

26:38.422 --> 26:40.163
is that the person
you want to be now?

26:40.207 --> 26:41.817
No.

26:41.861 --> 26:44.254
I want to be a good teammate,

26:44.298 --> 26:45.908
a good husband,

26:45.952 --> 26:48.476
and one day, uh,
I want to be a good father.

26:48.519 --> 26:51.914
Then you got to focus and get
your head straight, permanent.

26:51.958 --> 26:53.307
We both do.

26:53.350 --> 26:55.483
There's a lot riding
on us now, man.

27:07.364 --> 27:08.670
- 30-
- David to Command, we got eyes

27:08.714 --> 27:10.585
on Hondo, Tan and
Ally in the SUV.

27:10.629 --> 27:12.021
They're about three minutes out

27:12.065 --> 27:13.283
from the Pacoima
meetup location.

27:13.327 --> 27:15.503
Okay, copy that, Deac.

27:15.546 --> 27:17.548
How does that feel? Being
referred to as "Command"?

27:17.592 --> 27:19.942
Yeah, well, I'm not planning
on getting used to it.

27:19.986 --> 27:21.814
You should. It suits you.

27:24.730 --> 27:26.688
FOWLER:Doesn't seem like
the kind of place

27:26.732 --> 27:29.386
I'd picture a kingpin
doing a meetup. No,

27:29.430 --> 27:31.127
but this guy's underground
so much,

27:31.171 --> 27:33.129
maybe he's cautious
about where he pops up.

27:42.182 --> 27:44.010
TEMS-36 to Command,
Hondo, Tan and Ally

27:44.053 --> 27:45.446
are at the meetup location.

27:45.489 --> 27:46.490
Parked around the corner.

27:46.534 --> 27:47.491
Eyes on the them
via mounted dashcam.

27:47.535 --> 27:48.710
Place looks abandoned.

27:48.754 --> 27:50.669
This is the address
The King texted Miles.

27:50.712 --> 27:52.496
You got any guesses on
what this guy looks like?

27:56.457 --> 27:57.806
Maybe one of them?

27:59.590 --> 28:01.288
Hey, what's good?

28:01.331 --> 28:02.811
Which one of you is The King?

28:02.855 --> 28:05.640
Depends. Which one
of you is Miles?

28:05.684 --> 28:06.685
That'd be me.

28:06.728 --> 28:07.947
You're not what I was expecting.

28:07.990 --> 28:09.339
Well, the feeling's mutual.

28:09.383 --> 28:11.777
Your muscle,
your new business partner.

28:11.820 --> 28:12.995
Think I know who's who.

28:13.039 --> 28:16.433
That's Jackson, this is Ally.

28:16.477 --> 28:17.826
So which one of you's in charge?

28:19.872 --> 28:21.743
Okay, hey, hey. Take it easy.
You knew we'd come packing.

28:21.787 --> 28:23.049
Hey, no guns,

28:23.092 --> 28:24.224
no phones on any of you

28:24.267 --> 28:25.921
- where we're going.
- Yeah? Where we headed?

28:25.965 --> 28:27.488
- Not too far.
- Why?

28:27.531 --> 28:28.532
Because neither one
of these guys is The King.

28:34.016 --> 28:37.193
- 30-
- David to Command. Do we move in?

28:37.237 --> 28:39.761
You, too.
Give me a minute, Deac.

28:39.805 --> 28:41.545
You done copping a feel?

28:41.589 --> 28:43.199
Let's go.

28:43.243 --> 28:44.810
In the back.

28:44.853 --> 28:46.942
My mama always told me never
to accept rides from strangers.

28:46.986 --> 28:48.378
Look, you come with us
or not at all.

28:48.422 --> 28:49.379
We've got our own ride.

28:49.423 --> 28:50.816
Now, listen,

28:50.859 --> 28:52.948
The King's got
a schedule to keep.

28:53.949 --> 28:55.342
For that kind of money,

28:55.385 --> 28:56.778
he can give us a minute.

29:00.651 --> 29:01.914
Let's go.

29:06.832 --> 29:08.616
We still go
without cell trackers?

29:09.965 --> 29:11.401
- HONDO:20-
- Squad's got eyes on us.

29:11.445 --> 29:13.795
We can confirm The
King's identity,

29:13.839 --> 29:16.798
leave the site with his product
and let the cavalry roll in.

29:16.842 --> 29:19.714
The risk is there...

29:19.758 --> 29:21.020
but it's worth the reward.

29:21.063 --> 29:22.761
We're blind here now.

29:22.804 --> 29:24.806
We can move in,
arrest these two guys.
Mm-mm.

29:24.850 --> 29:27.287
Look, even if we flip them,
we don't ID The King.

29:27.330 --> 29:28.723
We lose our opportunity.

29:28.767 --> 29:30.377
- 30-
- David to Command, I'm asking again,

29:30.420 --> 29:31.378
do we move in?

29:31.421 --> 29:33.075
Negative. Let it play out.

29:34.294 --> 29:36.513
Hondo knows what he's doing.
I trust the team.

29:37.688 --> 29:38.864
Tan.

29:40.866 --> 29:44.870
If things do pop off, do you
know Ally's got your back?

29:45.958 --> 29:47.307
Lot of history there.

29:49.309 --> 29:51.615
Your thing is,
always trust your gut, right?

29:53.443 --> 29:55.837
So yeah, I do.

29:56.925 --> 29:58.187
All right.

29:58.231 --> 29:59.667
Let's do this thing.

29:59.710 --> 30:01.103
Let's go.

30:09.938 --> 30:11.287
- 30-
- David to Command,

30:11.331 --> 30:13.681
we pulled off the Talavera exit
onto Nordhoff.

30:18.860 --> 30:20.209
No place to go around,

30:20.253 --> 30:22.168
can't get onto the sidewalk
to catch up.

30:22.211 --> 30:23.734
Well, that's probably
a blessing.

30:23.778 --> 30:25.084
Anyone watching would see us.

30:25.127 --> 30:26.825
We're gonna lose them.

30:26.868 --> 30:28.739
Come on...

30:31.220 --> 30:32.874
- 30-
- David to Command, we've fallen behind,

30:32.918 --> 30:35.616
but we still got eyes
on the vehicle.

30:35.659 --> 30:36.704
Looks like Deacon and Fowler

30:36.747 --> 30:37.966
are tailing them
up into the foothills.

30:38.010 --> 30:40.490
There's nothing north
of there except RV parks

30:40.534 --> 30:41.927
and the Angel City Landfill.

30:41.970 --> 30:42.971
Gives lookouts a better view,

30:43.015 --> 30:44.016
staring down
at the whole valley.

30:44.059 --> 30:45.756
They'll see backup
coming a mile off.

30:45.800 --> 30:47.671
Means Deacon and Fowler
may get spotted.

30:47.715 --> 30:49.369
Do we send backup and
the chopper in now?

30:49.412 --> 30:50.805
Intercept the camper?

30:50.849 --> 30:52.807
No.

30:52.851 --> 30:56.680
Hold support units
and the chopper on standby.

30:56.724 --> 30:58.682
We keep the undercover op going.

31:06.952 --> 31:09.041
There. I see the camper.

31:09.084 --> 31:11.130
Nine o'clock. There's a lookout
just past the front gate

31:11.173 --> 31:12.392
under a tree.

31:12.435 --> 31:14.046
All right.
We got to go back around.

31:14.089 --> 31:16.700
- 30-
- David to Command, Hondo, Tan and Ally

31:16.744 --> 31:18.833
are in the Silver Springs
RV park.

31:32.499 --> 31:34.544
Let's go. Move.

31:36.416 --> 31:38.026
We can't drive up.

31:38.070 --> 31:40.289
That guy will see us.

31:40.333 --> 31:42.378
We'll go down the street,
approach on foot.

31:42.422 --> 31:43.814
What, we're not calling
for backup first?

31:43.858 --> 31:45.207
No. Can't risk blowing
Hondo and Tan's cover.

31:45.251 --> 31:47.557
We are the backup.

31:54.303 --> 31:55.565
Y'all sit tight.

31:55.609 --> 31:57.263
He'll be out in a minute.

31:57.306 --> 31:58.612
ALLY:You getting
that rush again?

31:59.700 --> 32:01.615
You used to live for this.

32:01.658 --> 32:02.964
This really the kind of thing
you still live for?

32:03.008 --> 32:04.705
Cool it, you two.

32:06.359 --> 32:07.882
- 30-
- David to Command.

32:07.926 --> 32:10.363
We're approaching the camper
and the meetup location on foot.

32:10.406 --> 32:12.582
Okay, copy that. We'll hold
backup for your signal.

32:12.626 --> 32:14.019
Chopper's in the air
circling two miles from you.

32:14.062 --> 32:15.411
We're still good.

32:15.455 --> 32:17.674
Once the handoff goes down
and Hondo and Tan leave,

32:17.718 --> 32:18.719
the cavalry can roll in.

32:19.981 --> 32:21.113
It's tough
without eyes

32:21.156 --> 32:22.941
on this or ears inside.

32:22.984 --> 32:24.855
Honestly, I don't know
how Hicks does it, either.

32:24.899 --> 32:26.988
Does what?
The waiting.

32:27.032 --> 32:28.120
Look, it's not about
the waiting.

32:28.163 --> 32:31.079
It's about believing,
in the team.

32:34.126 --> 32:36.911
Long drive down
from Fresno, Miles.

32:38.260 --> 32:39.566
How about a drink?

32:39.609 --> 32:41.960
I'm good, thanks.

32:42.003 --> 32:43.613
Long drive back. Ah.

32:43.657 --> 32:45.833
That's right, you said you had
a family issue to get back to?

32:45.876 --> 32:46.834
Is that right?

32:46.877 --> 32:47.878
Yeah, that's right.

32:47.922 --> 32:49.880
A sick parent, was it?

32:49.924 --> 32:51.186
No.

32:51.230 --> 32:52.405
Thankfully not.

32:52.448 --> 32:54.624
That's right, your sister.

32:56.191 --> 32:58.106
Just making sure.

33:00.152 --> 33:04.286
There's our camper. 11 o'clock,
about a hundred feet.

33:04.330 --> 33:08.987
Well, I figured you asked me out
here to talk expansion, so...

33:09.030 --> 33:10.205
let's chat.

33:11.293 --> 33:12.860
I blame my father

33:12.903 --> 33:14.296
for getting me
into this business.

33:16.298 --> 33:17.778
How about you, Miles?

33:19.780 --> 33:23.001
Well, I guess you could say my
pops tried to talk me out of it.

33:23.044 --> 33:24.959
Well, you should've
listened to him. This can be

33:25.003 --> 33:27.266
a costly endeavor.

33:27.309 --> 33:28.658
Especially when you realize
someone's been

33:28.702 --> 33:30.269
stealing from you
right under your nose.

33:30.312 --> 33:31.792
Like who?

33:31.835 --> 33:33.750
I asked you down here today

33:33.794 --> 33:34.969
because there's more
of my product

33:35.013 --> 33:37.841
on the streets in L.A.
and SoCal.

33:37.885 --> 33:41.410
It's got my brand name on it,
but I had it tested.

33:41.454 --> 33:44.196
Turns out,
it's not quite the same.

33:44.239 --> 33:45.849
It's been modified.

33:45.893 --> 33:48.069
Well, you know how the game
goes. You become the top brand,

33:48.113 --> 33:49.549
you're always gonna
have imposters,

33:49.592 --> 33:51.681
slapping your good name
on their inferior product.

33:51.725 --> 33:53.814
Yeah, except my inside source
says different.

33:57.513 --> 34:00.168
It says you've been
diluting my supply,

34:00.212 --> 34:01.909
cutting it with some other crap,

34:01.952 --> 34:03.302
and then trading
on my good name.

34:03.345 --> 34:04.868
You're slinging
weaker product

34:04.912 --> 34:07.741
and keeping all the extra
proceeds for yourself.

34:09.656 --> 34:12.267
And who's spitting
that nonsense?

34:12.311 --> 34:15.183
Well, according to
his phone calls and his texts,

34:15.227 --> 34:17.098
he works as your muscle.

34:35.595 --> 34:37.945
Here you go, Jackson.

34:37.988 --> 34:40.469
It's on you now.

34:40.513 --> 34:42.906
Kill Miles. We'll make sure
no one ever finds the body.

34:42.950 --> 34:44.604
Don't exactly
remember this

34:44.647 --> 34:46.171
being part of the equation.

34:46.214 --> 34:48.260
It's simple math.

34:48.303 --> 34:51.176
You do it or we kill you both.

34:51.219 --> 34:53.091
What's it gonna be?

35:04.363 --> 35:06.147
Can't do it.

35:06.191 --> 35:09.107
There's got to be
another way.

35:09.150 --> 35:11.979
Kill them both or die.

35:12.022 --> 35:14.155
What do you say to going
into business together, huh?

35:14.199 --> 35:16.331
Just the two of us,
then? What do you say?

35:16.375 --> 35:17.593
Come on.

35:20.596 --> 35:22.163
Lookout is patrolling now.

35:22.207 --> 35:23.730
Let's move.

35:48.189 --> 35:49.843
LAPD. Drop your weapon.

35:49.886 --> 35:51.540
Now! Do it now!

36:16.565 --> 36:18.480
Ally, come on.

36:20.569 --> 36:22.397
- Right here. Hey, you okay?
- Yeah.

36:39.936 --> 36:41.286
Go.

36:41.329 --> 36:44.071
Fowler, stay here.
Deacon, you're with me. Move.

36:45.377 --> 36:46.334
You okay?

36:46.378 --> 36:47.335
Yeah.

36:47.379 --> 36:48.989
All right, I got you.

36:53.733 --> 36:55.996
Stay down!
You're under arrest.

37:00.130 --> 37:01.784
You're not Miles.

37:01.828 --> 37:04.091
No, I'm not.
And you ain't no king.

37:05.484 --> 37:06.659
- 30-
- David to Command.

37:06.702 --> 37:08.661
Hondo, Tan and Ally are safe.

37:08.704 --> 37:10.140
Show us Code 4.

37:10.184 --> 37:12.012
Yeah! Team got it done.

37:14.014 --> 37:16.234
Think you had a pretty
big hand in this.

37:20.673 --> 37:23.719
All right, um, so, uh, now what?

37:23.763 --> 37:26.809
You want me to do some kind
of, uh, 12-step program?

37:26.853 --> 37:29.159
No, just one. Take a vacation.

37:29.203 --> 37:30.378
It might help you

37:30.422 --> 37:32.380
move away from this loss.

37:32.424 --> 37:34.948
Barb passed nine years ago.

37:34.991 --> 37:37.255
And you haven't given yourself
the time to properly grieve,

37:37.298 --> 37:38.821
- have you?
- I don't know.

37:38.865 --> 37:41.302
Maybe. Um...

37:41.346 --> 37:43.870
Maybe I haven't. I don't know.

37:43.913 --> 37:45.828
You've been avoiding it.
Given how important

37:45.872 --> 37:48.744
she was to you,
I can understand why.

37:50.355 --> 37:52.444
So, I'm assuming you're not
gonna sign off on me

37:52.487 --> 37:54.794
- until I return, then, huh?
- That's right.

37:54.837 --> 37:57.753
But if you like,
when you get back,

37:57.797 --> 37:59.364
we can continue these sessions.

37:59.407 --> 38:00.626
Well, we'll see.

38:01.714 --> 38:04.325
Sure. All right.

38:13.116 --> 38:14.292
Thank you, Doctor.

38:14.335 --> 38:17.077
You don't have to thank me.
It's my job.

38:17.120 --> 38:20.863
Yeah, but there's doing
your job and...

38:22.865 --> 38:25.085
...then there's making
a difference.

38:29.698 --> 38:32.048
Hey, Hondo.

38:32.092 --> 38:33.615
I just wanted to apologize.

38:33.659 --> 38:36.139
I set all this in
motion from the get-go,

38:36.183 --> 38:37.967
put us in a real tough spot.

38:38.011 --> 38:40.405
No, the situation
back there's on me, Tan.

38:40.448 --> 38:44.147
I assessed the risk, didn't see
how sideways it could get.

38:44.191 --> 38:46.149
Still, you know
what got to me today.

38:46.193 --> 38:48.021
Won't let it happen again.

38:48.064 --> 38:49.283
I know it won't.

38:49.327 --> 38:52.199
Look, I know the past
makes us who we are,

38:52.242 --> 38:54.375
but we also got to know
when to close the book on it.

38:58.553 --> 39:01.817
- Hondo.
- Commander.

39:01.861 --> 39:03.950
Hey. Commander, you good?

39:03.993 --> 39:05.560
Yeah. I heard what
went down today.

39:05.604 --> 39:07.649
Sounds like you made
the right calls.

39:07.693 --> 39:08.911
How'd you like running Command?

39:08.955 --> 39:12.306
Ah, not gonna lie.
It had its moments.

39:12.350 --> 39:13.568
Thanks for doing it
on short notice.

39:13.612 --> 39:15.831
Well, thank you for
the opportunity, Commander.

39:15.875 --> 39:17.529
Thanks.

39:18.747 --> 39:20.967
Hey, yo, now,
there's the real big shot.

39:21.010 --> 39:22.795
You did great
out there for us.

39:22.838 --> 39:25.101
FOWLER:Thanks. Well, thanks
for bringing me in.

39:25.145 --> 39:27.060
It was, uh, it was nice
to get a feel for it.

39:27.103 --> 39:28.366
Yeah, well, Deac says
you got what it takes

39:28.409 --> 39:29.889
to do real SWAT work.

39:29.932 --> 39:32.718
Well, you're the one
who gave me the chance, so...

39:32.761 --> 39:34.067
It means a lot to me.

39:34.110 --> 39:35.416
So now get through the
rest of SWAT Academy,

39:35.460 --> 39:37.853
and make it an everyday
occurrence, all right?

39:37.897 --> 39:39.377
Yes, sir.

39:44.251 --> 39:47.123
- Our last case in the bag.
- Mm-hmm.

39:47.167 --> 39:48.908
Thanks for your help back there.

39:48.951 --> 39:50.126
Hope that's not too bad.

39:50.170 --> 39:52.738
Eh, nothing I can't handle.

39:52.781 --> 39:54.130
Not sure how viable

39:54.174 --> 39:57.264
I'll be as an informant now, though.

39:57.307 --> 39:58.874
Word's gonna get out about me.

39:58.918 --> 40:00.180
To be honest,
it's not like

40:00.223 --> 40:01.660
I got a ton of options.

40:01.703 --> 40:03.662
Well, going straight's still
on the table. Just saying.

40:03.705 --> 40:07.187
The DA's office
unofficially says "thank you."

40:07.230 --> 40:08.841
And the charges against you
have been dropped.

40:08.884 --> 40:11.409
- You're free to go.
- Stay out of trouble, okay?

40:11.452 --> 40:12.845
Can you make sure
she gets home safe?

40:12.888 --> 40:14.977
Of course.

40:15.021 --> 40:16.979
I guess that's your way
of saying...

40:17.023 --> 40:19.025
Goodbye. Yeah.

40:19.068 --> 40:21.419
Got to get home to my wife.

40:22.985 --> 40:25.335
Hey.

40:25.379 --> 40:27.860
Whatever you end up
doing, stay safe.

40:27.903 --> 40:29.514
Take care of yourself.

40:43.136 --> 40:44.311
Hey.

40:44.354 --> 40:45.704
Ortiz really is innocent.

40:45.747 --> 40:47.488
Whoa, whoa. We don't,
we don't know that for sure.

40:47.532 --> 40:50.448
If Kim's statement places him
across town from the scene

40:50.491 --> 40:52.319
of the crime, then... Yeah, but that's
just her word.

40:52.362 --> 40:54.626
She has no way to-to prove
that she and Ortiz were

40:54.669 --> 40:56.889
actually together at the time
of Maria Lozano's murder.

40:56.932 --> 40:58.412
And she said

40:58.456 --> 40:59.587
that they were friends.

40:59.631 --> 41:01.459
I mean, she-she could be
lying for him.

41:01.502 --> 41:04.200
Ah. I thought
I was the cynical one.

41:06.028 --> 41:08.988
Look, overturning a plea deal
is nearly impossible.

41:09.031 --> 41:11.860
Yes. <i>Nearly</i> impossible.

41:11.904 --> 41:14.167
We both know this has
been weighing on you,

41:14.210 --> 41:16.169
and we have a real chance
to do something here.

41:16.212 --> 41:18.171
I just don't think
we need to give up yet.

41:18.214 --> 41:20.303
- Okay?
- It's just...

41:20.347 --> 41:23.655
Sometimes
I wonder if it's truly possible

41:23.698 --> 41:25.134
to-to right a wrong.

41:26.875 --> 41:28.877
Well, let's find out together.

41:30.792 --> 41:32.402
All right.
I like the sound of that.

41:32.446 --> 41:34.143
Yeah?
Yeah.
