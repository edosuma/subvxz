has agreed to provide it.

16:10.016 --> 16:12.020
He can ask
for anything he likes,

16:12.053 --> 16:14.124
anything at all,
and he's gonna get it.

16:15.494 --> 16:17.531
Why?

16:17.565 --> 16:21.138
From the moment
Johnny betrayed him,

16:21.171 --> 16:23.475
one imagines

16:23.510 --> 16:27.183
he was consumed with two things
and two things only:

16:27.217 --> 16:29.421
imagining revenge

16:29.454 --> 16:32.561
and acquiring
the means to make it real.

16:32.595 --> 16:36.101
Opium. Guns. K and R.
Influence.

16:36.134 --> 16:39.207
He had no problem
acquiring means.

16:39.241 --> 16:40.777
It was just a matter of time

16:40.811 --> 16:43.683
before he figured out
how to apply it.

16:43.717 --> 16:47.691
Who knows what leverage he holds
over whom and how,

16:47.725 --> 16:50.162
but in this moment,

16:50.196 --> 16:52.635
he's using it
for all it's worth,

16:52.668 --> 16:54.104
and it's working.

17:07.731 --> 17:10.537
I loved you and Johnny both

17:10.571 --> 17:13.442
as I would sons.

17:13.475 --> 17:16.649
I warned you both
that the choices you were making

17:16.683 --> 17:19.187
would have consequences.

17:19.221 --> 17:23.095
And I watched as you did
whatever the hell you wanted,

17:23.128 --> 17:25.299
as sons will.

17:25.333 --> 17:28.405
Him leaving the Agency
to be Lawrence of Arabia

17:28.439 --> 17:30.544
and you leaving it
to be a policeman.

17:30.577 --> 17:32.581
The only surprise

17:32.615 --> 17:34.685
is that it took so damn long

17:34.719 --> 17:36.689
for any of this
to catch up to you.

17:36.723 --> 17:38.560
I spoke to him.

17:38.593 --> 17:40.363
Spoke to who?

17:40.396 --> 17:42.233
Johnny. I called him.

17:42.267 --> 17:45.072
And I tried to help him escape.

17:45.106 --> 17:47.210
-When did you do...
-Just before he was
about to get caught. Last night.

17:47.243 --> 17:50.651
-Why would you...
-Because in the process
of pulling out his fingernails,

17:50.684 --> 17:52.487
maybe Faraz Hamzad learns

17:52.521 --> 17:55.861
that Johnny had some help
screwing him over.

17:55.894 --> 17:58.533
And then all kinds of stories

17:58.566 --> 18:01.138
crawl out into the light.

18:01.171 --> 18:02.708
And then maybe the next name

18:02.741 --> 18:05.514
on Faraz Hamzad's revenge list

18:05.547 --> 18:07.150
is mine.

18:08.352 --> 18:11.759
This thing has been buried
in the ground for 30 years.

18:11.793 --> 18:14.799
I wanted it to stay there.

18:17.605 --> 18:20.276
Well, you should've
called me first.

18:20.309 --> 18:22.347
What, you would've told me
not to call him?

18:22.380 --> 18:24.819
I would've told you that
Johnny doesn't fucking listen

18:24.852 --> 18:27.758
no matter how much sense
you think you're making.

18:27.791 --> 18:30.363
And I might have told you
that there are better ways

18:30.396 --> 18:34.270
of keeping things buried
in the ground

18:34.304 --> 18:37.143
than trying

18:37.176 --> 18:39.180
to wish them away.

18:50.236 --> 18:51.506
Is that what I think it is?

18:52.473 --> 18:54.210
One day,

18:54.244 --> 18:56.616
a nice young lady
from The New York Times

18:56.649 --> 18:58.218
is going to call you.

18:58.252 --> 18:59.855
And she'll pull back
the curtains,

18:59.889 --> 19:02.628
and I hope you see
that all the work you've done,

19:02.661 --> 19:05.232
all the things you've built--
they mattered.

19:05.266 --> 19:08.540
They're appreciated.
They'll survive.

19:08.573 --> 19:10.677
I hope you'll see tears

19:10.711 --> 19:13.349
and reverence and love.

19:13.382 --> 19:15.721
Believe me when I tell you
that moment

19:15.754 --> 19:19.260
is what every moment
that preceded it

19:19.294 --> 19:21.799
has been for.

19:21.833 --> 19:24.204
What you don't want to see
is doubt.

19:24.237 --> 19:25.473
Ill regard.

19:25.507 --> 19:27.644
Gossip and indictments

19:27.678 --> 19:29.548
and your wife's shame

19:29.582 --> 19:32.420
and your grandson's confusion

19:32.453 --> 19:36.161
about what kind of man
his grandfather truly was.

19:37.330 --> 19:39.568
Do what you must

19:39.602 --> 19:43.576
to protect that moment.

19:43.610 --> 19:46.549
Do anything you must.

19:47.785 --> 19:50.757
If I even touch
that piece of paper

19:50.791 --> 19:52.928
and anyone ever finds out,

19:52.961 --> 19:54.464
I have a pretty good guess

19:54.498 --> 19:57.336
what the headline
on my obituary will be.

19:58.907 --> 20:00.276
And it's not gonna be good.

20:06.889 --> 20:08.960
BOTE:
The light's perfect.

20:13.469 --> 20:16.475
Would that it might
stay that way forever.

20:25.660 --> 20:27.698
(food sizzling)

20:29.000 --> 20:30.236
(Chase exhales)

20:30.269 --> 20:31.806
Why are you doing this?

20:31.839 --> 20:33.543
(Chase chuckles)

20:33.576 --> 20:36.481
Well, I saw
what you were about to eat.

20:36.516 --> 20:37.785
(short chuckle)

20:37.818 --> 20:40.891
Somebody needed to do this.

20:40.924 --> 20:44.698
Besides, I've got time to kill
before the tow truck comes.

20:44.732 --> 20:46.736
-And I really...
I really enjoy, uh...
-No, I meant...

20:46.769 --> 20:48.405
I meant "why are you doing this"

20:48.439 --> 20:50.476
in a "I hope you don't think
it's gonna change my mind

20:50.510 --> 20:53.015
-about the rental" kind of way.
-(chuckles)

20:53.048 --> 20:54.885
Well,

20:54.919 --> 20:57.825
try this
and then let's talk, hmm?

21:00.964 --> 21:02.701
You look like you know what
you're doing. (clears throat)

21:02.734 --> 21:04.605
I-I used to do it more.

21:04.638 --> 21:06.041
You know, cook.

21:06.074 --> 21:08.980
-Before my son went to college.
-Mm.

21:09.013 --> 21:10.817
I don't-I don't
miss the stress of it.

21:10.851 --> 21:12.621
I mean, I know some people
find it relaxing,

21:12.654 --> 21:14.625
but all I ever felt

21:14.658 --> 21:16.629
was the fear of burning things.
(chuckles)

21:16.662 --> 21:18.031
Well,

21:18.065 --> 21:20.436
maybe whoever
taught you to do it

21:20.469 --> 21:23.041
skipped a few steps, hmm?

21:23.075 --> 21:26.081
Could be.
Who taught you?

21:26.114 --> 21:28.920
CHASE:
Oh, this guy I served with.

21:28.953 --> 21:31.091
ZOE:
You were in the army?

21:31.124 --> 21:34.063
Yeah.
A long time ago. He was a local.

21:34.097 --> 21:37.805
Uh, very... very well-respected.

21:37.838 --> 21:40.442
And he took his kitchen
very seriously.

21:40.476 --> 21:43.015
I... I found that rather odd.

21:43.048 --> 21:45.921
I talked to him about it.

21:45.954 --> 21:49.628
And he told me this story
that he was told as a young boy

21:49.662 --> 21:52.968
about this wise old man
and his garden.

21:53.001 --> 21:55.339
This, uh...

21:55.372 --> 21:58.613
(exhales)
This wise old man,

21:58.646 --> 22:01.017
he never spoke.

22:01.051 --> 22:03.488
And, uh,
it wasn't because he couldn't

22:03.523 --> 22:05.961
or because he had
nothing to say.

22:05.994 --> 22:08.365
It was because he believed

22:08.398 --> 22:11.606
that language deceived.

22:11.639 --> 22:15.346
That by its very nature,
it clouded the truth, so

22:15.379 --> 22:17.851
it made the world
harder to know.

22:17.885 --> 22:19.955
And, uh, this...

22:19.989 --> 22:22.995
This wise old man, he believed

22:23.028 --> 22:25.466
that the truth...

22:25.500 --> 22:26.969
(chuckles softly)

22:27.003 --> 22:31.378
...the truth
lived only in silence.

22:32.581 --> 22:35.019
Communicated by other means.

22:35.052 --> 22:39.127
That the food he prepared
from his garden,

22:39.160 --> 22:41.899
that conveyed, you know,
his affection,

22:41.933 --> 22:45.674
his gratitude

22:45.707 --> 22:47.945
or his indifference...

22:49.548 --> 22:52.988
...far better than any words
could convey.

22:53.021 --> 22:56.662
And it was said
that this wise old man...

22:56.696 --> 22:58.533
(chuckles)

22:58.566 --> 23:02.073
He could change minds
in that way.

23:04.511 --> 23:06.983
He could

23:07.016 --> 23:09.655
soften the hardest of hearts...

23:11.057 --> 23:12.861
...without ever saying...

23:14.632 --> 23:16.101
...one word.

23:23.616 --> 23:25.085
(chuckles)

23:36.909 --> 23:37.978
(Zoe chuckles softly)

23:42.119 --> 23:44.792
Am I getting anywhere?
(chuckles)

23:44.825 --> 23:47.731
(dishes clattering)

23:47.764 --> 23:49.434
When I was a kid...

23:50.770 --> 23:52.608
...and I was having a moment...

23:54.177 --> 23:56.782
...my mom
used to drop everything

23:56.816 --> 23:58.686
and just make me scrambled eggs.
(chuckles)

23:58.720 --> 24:00.523
CHASE:
Hey.

24:00.557 --> 24:02.594
I don't know why it worked,
but it did.

24:04.898 --> 24:06.569
Maybe you're onto something.

24:11.646 --> 24:13.215
-Tell me more about the dogs.
-(faucet running)

24:14.652 --> 24:15.987
(faucet turns off)

24:16.021 --> 24:18.993
Oh, they're sweethearts. Yeah.

24:19.027 --> 24:21.832
They've been sitting
absolutely still for 20 minutes.

24:21.866 --> 24:23.135
Is that because they
listen really well

24:23.168 --> 24:25.239
or because they're
giving each other ideas?

24:25.272 --> 24:27.644
Oh, well,
they're exceptional listeners.

24:27.678 --> 24:30.583
I asked them to sit.
They're sitting.

24:30.617 --> 24:32.554
And if you ask them
not to eat the guest house,

24:32.587 --> 24:35.025
would they listen to that, too?

24:36.796 --> 24:40.570
Uh, you seem very uncomfortable
with all this,

24:40.603 --> 24:43.643
-and, you know, I...
Truly, I understand.
-(vehicle approaching)

24:43.676 --> 24:45.245
-(sighs) I don't want to...
-(brakes squeal)

24:45.279 --> 24:46.982
Oh, look, there's the tow truck.

24:47.016 --> 24:50.155
I don't want to cause you any
trouble or make you regret this.

24:50.189 --> 24:53.095
It's been nice to meet you.
Wonderful to cook for you.

24:53.128 --> 24:54.197
Two months' rent.

24:55.567 --> 24:57.704
As security.

24:57.738 --> 24:59.508
-(car door closes)
-Oh, no, we're...

24:59.541 --> 25:01.111
-Well, are you sure?
-In cash.

25:02.547 --> 25:05.787
And you'll cook
three nights a week.

25:05.820 --> 25:07.657
Groceries are on your dime.

25:10.329 --> 25:13.168
If you can live with that,
I can live with this.

25:17.209 --> 25:19.581
(sighs)

25:19.615 --> 25:21.619
(chuckles)

25:21.652 --> 25:23.055
Deal.

25:23.088 --> 25:24.525
(door opens)

25:30.035 --> 25:31.271
-(door closes)
-(groans)

25:34.043 --> 25:36.782
(grunts)
Ow.

25:36.816 --> 25:38.653
(grunting, panting)

25:43.061 --> 25:44.665
(groans)

25:48.271 --> 25:50.042
Oh.

25:50.075 --> 25:51.679
We're okay.

25:53.081 --> 25:54.918
(grunting, panting)

26:04.805 --> 26:07.811
Well, we're gonna be okay
for a little while.

26:13.121 --> 26:14.958
(phone ringing)

26:17.631 --> 26:18.566
(indistinct chatter)

26:18.599 --> 26:20.369
RECEPTIONIST:
FBI Directorate of Intelligence.

26:20.402 --> 26:22.206
This is an unsecured line.
How may I direct your call?

26:24.010 --> 26:26.047
(chatter quiets)

26:44.050 --> 26:46.321
(sighs)
I'm fine, guys.

26:46.354 --> 26:48.626
As you were.

26:48.659 --> 26:50.797
Whose birthday?

26:50.830 --> 26:52.032
ANGELA:
Joe's.

26:53.703 --> 26:56.040
If it's your birthday,
why aren't you having cake?

26:56.074 --> 26:57.944
Well, I don't like cake.

26:57.978 --> 27:00.917
Or celebrating at work.

27:00.950 --> 27:01.919
Or birthdays.

27:03.121 --> 27:04.157
Okay.

27:04.190 --> 27:06.060
So, what are we doing here?

27:06.094 --> 27:09.635
Well, everyone else
likes those things.

27:11.237 --> 27:12.273
Okay.

27:13.743 --> 27:15.212
Uh, we should get you
up to speed on this.

27:15.245 --> 27:18.251
-Uh, is now a good time?
-Sure thing.

27:18.285 --> 27:19.922
Just give me a minute
to settle in.

27:35.052 --> 27:37.791
-How you holding up, kiddo?
-I'm okay.
What are you doing here?

27:37.824 --> 27:40.730
You don't sound so okay.

27:40.763 --> 27:42.834
I'm not okay.

27:42.868 --> 27:44.738
It's only been a few weeks.

27:45.874 --> 27:47.209
Are you okay?

27:50.415 --> 27:53.789
No.

27:53.823 --> 27:56.060
It's wrong for them to have
brought you in like this.

27:56.094 --> 27:57.864
I mean,
Cheryl needs you at home.

27:57.898 --> 27:59.033
Henry needs you at home.

27:59.066 --> 28:01.204
You need you at home.

28:01.237 --> 28:03.910
Joe has everything
under control here.

28:03.943 --> 28:06.080
Thank you. I mean it.

28:06.114 --> 28:09.420
Right now,
I've been asked in to do my job,

28:09.453 --> 28:14.063
so I'm just trying to focus
on doing my job.

28:14.096 --> 28:15.833
Come on in, Joe.

28:15.867 --> 28:17.136
What do you got?

28:19.073 --> 28:22.146
Well, been working
on these aliases,

28:22.179 --> 28:24.016
-but there's not a whole hell
of a lot to go on.
-Aliases?

28:24.050 --> 28:25.252
-JOE: Yeah.
-What aliases?

28:25.285 --> 28:27.256
JOE:
From the subject, our guy Chase.

28:27.289 --> 28:29.995
-Where'd we get aliases from?
-JOE: From the Agency.

28:30.028 --> 28:32.433
Somehow they managed
to harvest six names.

28:32.466 --> 28:34.738
And if we
can positively ID them,

28:34.771 --> 28:36.809
then we can start surveillance
on bank accounts, residences

28:36.842 --> 28:38.445
and make it hard
for this guy to function.

28:38.478 --> 28:40.750
Wait, I thought you were on
the ground when this went down.

28:40.783 --> 28:42.286
-How did you not know
we had this?
-The guy in charge

28:42.319 --> 28:44.357
when I got there. Uh, Waters.

28:44.390 --> 28:46.862
Apparently,
he didn't want me to know.

28:46.896 --> 28:48.933
-Why would he
keep that from you?
-Who knows.

28:48.966 --> 28:51.271
Keep pushing everyone on this.

28:51.304 --> 28:55.379
And copy me
on all the raw data you pull in.

28:55.412 --> 28:58.385
I should have my eyes
on everything, as well.

28:58.418 --> 28:59.821
And...

28:59.855 --> 29:01.725
Uh, do me a favor.
Close the door.

29:05.934 --> 29:08.873
I've got another name
that we have to track down,

29:08.906 --> 29:11.344
but I want you guys to do it.

29:11.377 --> 29:13.448
-No one else.
-Okay. What's the name?

29:13.481 --> 29:15.887
I don't know.

29:15.920 --> 29:18.559
Dan Chase has a daughter.

29:18.593 --> 29:22.199
I don't know anything about her,
but I know she exists.

29:22.232 --> 29:24.871
And I know if I can find her,

29:24.905 --> 29:26.474
I can get control of him.

29:26.508 --> 29:28.311
Well, if you don't know anything
about her, how do you know

29:28.345 --> 29:30.516
-that she exists?
-I know him.

29:30.550 --> 29:33.288
Knew him, at least.

29:33.321 --> 29:35.560
We served together.

29:35.593 --> 29:38.031
Jesus. So that's
why they called you in.

29:38.064 --> 29:39.367
Yeah.

29:39.400 --> 29:40.937
It was a long time ago,

29:40.970 --> 29:44.010
but yeah, I have some skin
in the game on this one,

29:44.043 --> 29:45.847
so I want to see it through.

29:45.880 --> 29:47.884
(sighs)
Okay.

29:47.917 --> 29:49.788
I'm on it.

29:57.269 --> 29:58.539
And, kiddo.

30:00.275 --> 30:03.014
You don't
have to worry about me.

30:04.050 --> 30:05.285
Well, I'm gonna.

30:21.351 --> 30:23.188
(keys clacking)

30:33.542 --> 30:35.212
(knock on door)

30:35.245 --> 30:37.082
(dogs growling quietly)

30:39.955 --> 30:41.357
-ZOE: Peter?
-(growling stops)

30:44.096 --> 30:45.165
(grunts)

30:47.369 --> 30:50.108
-Hi there.
-Hi.

30:50.142 --> 30:53.081
Is it my night to cook?

30:54.050 --> 30:57.590
No. Uh, no. Um, I just...

30:57.624 --> 30:59.561
I feel like I need
to ask you something.

30:59.594 --> 31:01.999
Oh, okay.

31:05.238 --> 31:06.875
I'd like you
to have dinner with me.

31:10.449 --> 31:11.652
Oh.

31:11.685 --> 31:14.390
I-I'm confused now.

31:14.423 --> 31:15.927
It is my night to cook?

31:15.960 --> 31:18.231
No, no.

31:18.264 --> 31:21.104
No, I-I'm-I'm...
Dinner.

31:22.674 --> 31:25.112
O-Out. With me.

31:27.282 --> 31:28.519
Oh.

31:31.290 --> 31:33.094
Okay, sure. Why not.

31:42.079 --> 31:43.381
EMILY (over phone):
Dad.

31:43.415 --> 31:45.252
CHASE (over phone):
Yeah.

31:46.655 --> 31:48.391
-EMILY: Dad.
-CHASE: Yeah.

31:48.425 --> 31:50.295
-I know.
-EMILY: I mean...

31:50.328 --> 31:51.698
CHASE:
Look, if I say no,

31:51.732 --> 31:53.468
then maybe she starts
getting suspicious

31:53.502 --> 31:56.340
why I won't be seen in public.

31:56.374 --> 31:58.679
-EMILY: Dad.
-CHASE: Look, I don't know.

31:58.712 --> 32:00.516
She asked. I said yes.

32:00.550 --> 32:02.720
It just, uh, it just came out.

32:02.754 --> 32:05.258
What do you want me to tell you?
I'll be okay, okay?

32:05.292 --> 32:06.528
Your server
will be right with you.

32:06.562 --> 32:08.398
-Thank you.
-CHASE: I know what I'm doing.

32:10.168 --> 32:12.005
(pills rattle)

32:14.644 --> 32:16.682
(Chase chuckles quietly)

32:18.017 --> 32:19.621
Well, that's attractive.
(sighs)

32:19.654 --> 32:23.027
-(chuckles)
-Uh... Why don't I
just put that back.

32:23.061 --> 32:25.265
-We can pretend
that never happened. (chuckles)
-(pills rattle)

32:25.298 --> 32:26.969
Let's see what you got.
(chuckles)

32:27.737 --> 32:29.975
(Zoe chuckles)

32:31.344 --> 32:33.014
Um...

32:36.788 --> 32:38.224
Acid reflux.

32:38.258 --> 32:40.663
Ah, acid reflux.

32:43.001 --> 32:44.938
Uh, statin?

32:48.411 --> 32:50.382
(chuckles)

32:50.415 --> 32:54.223
-You got anything I don't have?
-Uh... phosphatidylserine.

32:54.256 --> 32:57.429
-You got any phosphatidylserine?
-What does that do?

32:57.462 --> 32:59.701
Oh, it prevents
cognitive decline.

33:01.137 --> 33:03.074
Probably doesn't do that,
you know.

33:03.107 --> 33:06.247
Yeah, you're probably right.

33:06.280 --> 33:09.788
But my wife, she, uh...
she died of Huntington's disease

33:09.821 --> 33:12.727
after six years
of severe dementia,

33:12.760 --> 33:14.363
so I'm erring
on the side of caution.

33:14.396 --> 33:16.334
(chuckles)

33:16.367 --> 33:18.338
And here I thought
this would be awkward.

33:18.371 --> 33:21.344
What, you've never started
a first date

33:21.377 --> 33:23.682
with an ailment contest before?

33:23.716 --> 33:25.753
No, I cannot say that I have.

33:27.824 --> 33:30.328
How long has it been for you?

33:30.362 --> 33:32.199
You know,
since your last first date.

33:35.405 --> 33:37.109
George Bush, thereabouts.

33:37.142 --> 33:38.546
Oh. Well, which one?

33:38.579 --> 33:40.181
Read my lips.

33:40.215 --> 33:42.319
-Oh, that's... Ha, ha.
-(laughs)

33:42.352 --> 33:44.524
That's a long time ago.

33:44.558 --> 33:46.528
Yeah, I'm just now realizing
just how long.

33:46.562 --> 33:48.566
How about you?

33:48.599 --> 33:50.536
Oh, a bit longer than that.

33:52.707 --> 33:55.078
My wife, actually.

33:55.111 --> 33:57.349
How long has it been
since she passed away?

33:57.382 --> 34:00.823
Oh, little over five years.

34:00.856 --> 34:03.495
Yeah, we were, um...

34:03.529 --> 34:06.200
(chuckles)
We were married for 21 years,

34:06.234 --> 34:08.639
but... (sighs)

34:08.672 --> 34:11.377
I knew she was the one
long before that.

34:11.410 --> 34:14.483
It was too complicated
to act on it,

34:14.517 --> 34:17.322
but the minute I saw her,

34:17.356 --> 34:18.759
I knew she was the one.

34:21.565 --> 34:24.169
How long has it been
since your divorce?

34:26.508 --> 34:28.444
About the same as you.

34:28.478 --> 34:29.648
-Five years.
-Hmm.

34:29.681 --> 34:31.518
What happened?

34:33.354 --> 34:35.258
I mean, we don't
have to talk about that.

34:35.292 --> 34:36.595
No, no, no, it's fine.

34:36.628 --> 34:40.302
He... (scoffs, chuckles)

34:40.335 --> 34:42.139
Is it strange
that you have an easier time

34:42.172 --> 34:43.408
talking about
your wife passing away

34:43.441 --> 34:45.513
-than I do about
my husband leaving me?
-No.

34:45.546 --> 34:46.848
No, it's not.

34:51.858 --> 34:53.696
No, it's not, is it?

34:57.436 --> 35:00.141
Uh...

35:00.175 --> 35:03.348
Well, we-we married in our 20s,
and, you know, it made sense.

35:03.381 --> 35:05.720
Um, we...

35:05.753 --> 35:08.257
I supported him however I could.

35:08.291 --> 35:09.728
Enjoyed his company,
he enjoyed mine.

35:09.761 --> 35:11.698
We picked up slack.

35:11.732 --> 35:15.305
We hosted and fought

35:15.338 --> 35:17.777
and apologized, and...

35:17.810 --> 35:20.248
-laughed and compromised.
-Mm-hmm.

35:20.281 --> 35:22.486
-And had a son.
-Mm-hmm.

35:22.520 --> 35:26.093
Loved him, cared for him, and...

35:27.429 --> 35:29.567
We had a life, you know.
We worked at it.

35:29.601 --> 35:33.876
And it-it made sense until
one day I woke up and it didn't.

35:33.909 --> 35:38.184
And then there was a woman...

35:38.217 --> 35:40.723
much younger than me.

35:40.756 --> 35:42.225
And then it was over.

35:42.259 --> 35:43.796
And my house got very,
very quiet.

35:44.764 --> 35:48.171
Oh. You didn't deserve that.

35:51.611 --> 35:52.613
Thank you.

35:52.647 --> 35:54.450
I mean it.

35:54.483 --> 35:55.653
Oh?

35:58.993 --> 36:00.863
You sure about that?

36:01.965 --> 36:04.136
Yes, I am.

36:10.382 --> 36:12.285
Then let me tell you the story
a different way.

36:20.368 --> 36:24.811
When we got married in our 20s,
it made sense to everyone.

36:26.948 --> 36:30.422
I was pretty sure
it made sense to me, too.

36:30.455 --> 36:32.192
We enjoyed each other's company.

36:33.662 --> 36:35.933
We had a life.

36:35.966 --> 36:39.473
Until one day, I woke up,
and I couldn't breathe.

36:40.843 --> 36:45.318
I dragged myself to the mirror,
and I...

36:45.351 --> 36:49.627
I recognized the eyes
but not the face.

36:49.661 --> 36:50.930
It wasn't my face.

36:52.332 --> 36:55.472
It was my mother's face, or...

36:55.506 --> 36:57.643
a stranger's face.

36:59.814 --> 37:02.887
Nothing made any sense.

37:02.920 --> 37:07.329
So, I got the courage
to talk to my husband,

37:07.362 --> 37:11.370
and I said,
"Something is very wrong,

37:11.404 --> 37:14.376
I am living the wrong life."

37:14.410 --> 37:16.815
But I wanted to fix it somehow.

37:16.848 --> 37:18.919
I wanted to fix it with him.

37:18.952 --> 37:21.725
I wanted to live the right life
with him.

37:23.327 --> 37:25.365
And he agreed,

37:25.398 --> 37:28.605
and he sacrificed,
and he supported,

37:28.639 --> 37:31.812
and he picked up slack,
and he compromised, and...

37:33.381 --> 37:34.818
(scoffs)

37:34.851 --> 37:36.755
...I didn't get any happier.

37:38.692 --> 37:41.263
But I tried.

37:41.297 --> 37:42.867
I tried.

37:46.073 --> 37:47.944
I tried.

37:52.486 --> 37:54.924
So, eventually,
he couldn't sacrifice anymore.

37:54.958 --> 37:56.928
Eventually,
he found a life that made sense

37:56.962 --> 38:00.603
with a woman who,

38:00.636 --> 38:01.805
when she tried to get happy,

38:01.838 --> 38:03.307
she succeeded.

38:04.476 --> 38:06.347
And the happier he got with her,

38:06.380 --> 38:08.785
the more and more resentful
he got towards me,

38:08.819 --> 38:11.390
and...

38:11.423 --> 38:12.994
spiteful.

38:15.331 --> 38:18.437
And my life got really,
really quiet.

38:23.381 --> 38:25.886
Why would you tell the story
that way?

38:30.996 --> 38:33.869
I tell it to myself both ways.

38:33.902 --> 38:36.641
Honest to God, I don't know
which one is the truth.

38:36.675 --> 38:37.910
I don't, uh,

38:37.944 --> 38:41.818
I don't think
what happened was your fault.

38:41.852 --> 38:45.358
-Well...
-Oh, you can't control
how you feel, you know?

38:48.097 --> 38:50.335
You're not the villain here.

38:54.142 --> 38:56.380
I hope that's true.

38:58.017 --> 39:00.021
I think that's true.

39:00.054 --> 39:02.459
But here's what I do know.

39:02.493 --> 39:05.465
Nobody ever sees themselves
as playing that role.

39:06.467 --> 39:08.705
Right?

39:08.739 --> 39:10.743
But there they are.

39:10.776 --> 39:12.947
There's a villain
in every story.

39:14.584 --> 39:16.521
Maybe that's why.

39:16.555 --> 39:19.727
Maybe the only one
who can play that role

39:19.761 --> 39:22.533
is the one
who can't see it happening.

39:27.710 --> 39:30.014
Sorry. Was that too much?

39:38.932 --> 39:40.869
-SERVER: Can I get you
a wine list?
-Yeah.

39:40.903 --> 39:42.405
Yeah.

39:54.129 --> 39:55.933
(indistinct chatter)

39:57.737 --> 39:59.741
(typing)

40:03.749 --> 40:05.018
WATERS:
Hi.

40:06.755 --> 40:08.859
I'm-I'm Ray Waters.

40:09.928 --> 40:11.130
Your CIA liaison,

40:11.163 --> 40:13.034
though no one seems
particularly excited

40:13.067 --> 40:14.971
about liaising with me.

40:16.240 --> 40:18.612
It's almost as if someone
instructed them not to.

40:18.645 --> 40:19.847
Any idea who that might've been?

40:21.685 --> 40:23.755
Yeah, that was me.

40:25.058 --> 40:26.460
All right, then.

40:28.699 --> 40:32.038
You're upset that I've been less
than forthcoming with your boss.

40:33.842 --> 40:35.913
May I ask why?

40:35.946 --> 40:39.621
Well, he hired me
out of Quantico,

40:39.654 --> 40:42.793
launched my career, taught me
almost everything I know,

40:42.827 --> 40:44.530
protected me when
it was dangerous for him to.

40:44.564 --> 40:46.534
Should I go on?

40:46.568 --> 40:48.104
No, there's no daylight
between the two of you.

40:48.137 --> 40:49.774
I can see that.

40:49.807 --> 40:51.911
I assume he's told you
all about Faraz Hamzad, then.

40:55.753 --> 40:58.090
He hasn't?

40:58.124 --> 40:59.627
Well, then,
that's-that's interesting.

41:01.096 --> 41:02.667
I made some calls this morning
trying to figure out

41:02.700 --> 41:04.904
what it was
we're mixed up in here.

41:04.937 --> 41:06.608
Would you like to know
what I heard?

41:08.845 --> 41:10.916
Faraz Hamzad was a warlord
in Afghanistan

41:10.949 --> 41:12.920
during the Soviet invasion.

41:12.953 --> 41:14.924
Now, not our favorite, right?

41:14.957 --> 41:17.830
But formidable enough we
couldn't discount him, either.

41:19.099 --> 41:21.938
But what made him so formidable

41:21.971 --> 41:24.811
was he had a man in his camp,

41:24.844 --> 41:26.915
scared the living shit
out of everyone over there.

41:28.250 --> 41:32.025
He shot a rival warlord
between the eyes at 1,100 yards.

41:32.058 --> 41:35.799
Word was, he'd go on raids
against Russian units,

41:35.833 --> 41:37.202
alone.

41:37.235 --> 41:39.574
Now, I'm talking hard targets--

41:39.607 --> 41:41.811
pipe-hitting,
spetsnaz motherfuckers.

41:41.845 --> 41:45.619
And then just disappeared
into the night,

41:45.652 --> 41:49.092
having dropped a dozen bodies
in total fucking silence.

41:49.126 --> 41:53.000
No alarm, no witnesses.

41:53.034 --> 41:54.570
I mean, he's-he's just
a goddamn madman,

41:54.604 --> 41:56.240
this guy, right?

41:56.273 --> 41:58.979
Now, in the Panjshir Valley,

Baba-khorkhore.

42:10.669 --> 42:12.238

a rumor floating around.

42:12.272 --> 42:16.080
Baba-khorkhore,
actually ex-Agency.

42:17.883 --> 42:20.021

You got a...

42:20.054 --> 42:23.027

Russians in the battlefield.

42:33.347 --> 42:35.118
...was Dan Chase.

42:36.320 --> 42:38.792

to get his hands on him

42:38.825 --> 42:39.861

See, now, you just got to wonder
what he might have known.

Right? You got to wonder what
he might have done about it.

43:07.683 --> 43:10.656

he might be willing to go

43:23.147 --> 43:26.053

how much you fuck up,

Hello?

HARPER:
Hello.

59:41.135 --> 59:44.241
Morgan Bote gave me your number.

59:44.275 --> 59:46.613
JULIAN:
I've been expecting your call.

59:46.647 --> 59:48.617
Is this a good time?

59:48.651 --> 59:51.088
Uh, well...
Yeah, hold on, please.

59:56.032 --> 59:59.038
You do understand
what it is I do, yes?

59:59.071 --> 1:00:01.844
I've been on one or two
of these calls before,

1:00:01.877 --> 1:00:03.313
in another life.

1:00:03.346 --> 1:00:04.916
Went to great lengths
to make sure

1:00:04.950 --> 1:00:07.622
I'd never be
on one of them again.

1:00:07.655 --> 1:00:10.193
I was offered your number.

1:00:10.227 --> 1:00:12.164
I took it.

1:00:12.197 --> 1:00:14.068
I don't know why I took it.

1:00:14.101 --> 1:00:16.205
I guess I figured it was okay

1:00:16.239 --> 1:00:19.378
because there was no way
I'd ever be able to use it.

1:00:21.315 --> 1:00:22.886
Why wouldn't you
be able to use it?

1:00:24.455 --> 1:00:27.194
The guy I wanted you to visit--

1:00:27.227 --> 1:00:29.031
I figured there was
a good chance

1:00:29.064 --> 1:00:31.202
he'd never be found again.

1:00:31.235 --> 1:00:34.341
It's hard to disappear
in this world.

1:00:34.375 --> 1:00:36.780
You're giving this guy
a lot of credit.

1:00:38.449 --> 1:00:39.886
Are you good at this?

1:00:39.920 --> 1:00:40.888
Beg your pardon?

1:00:40.922 --> 1:00:43.794
Are you good at this?

1:00:43.828 --> 1:00:45.230
I don't think you would've
been given my number

1:00:45.263 --> 1:00:47.067
if I weren't.

1:00:47.100 --> 1:00:49.338
I don't think so either,
but I'd like to hear you say it.

1:00:50.842 --> 1:00:53.112
Yeah.
I know what I'm doing.

1:00:53.146 --> 1:00:55.083
Because no matter
what this sounds like to you--

1:00:55.116 --> 1:00:57.722
no matter how easy
any of this sounds--

1:00:57.755 --> 1:01:00.393
it will not be easy.

1:01:00.427 --> 1:01:03.366
There's nothing he won't do
to ensure his own survival.

1:01:03.399 --> 1:01:05.905
There is no limit
to the damage he'll do

1:01:05.938 --> 1:01:07.775
or the things he'll destroy.

1:01:08.978 --> 1:01:11.082
This is not someone
to underestimate.

1:01:13.152 --> 1:01:16.259
So, if you're asking me
to help you locate him,

1:01:16.292 --> 1:01:19.699
it would be helpful to be
pointed in the right direction.

1:01:25.243 --> 1:01:28.751
4921 Stratford Avenue.

1:01:28.784 --> 1:01:31.355
Colliersville, Pennsylvania.

1:01:36.767 --> 1:01:38.236
Let me know when it's done.

1:03:50.534 --> 1:03:51.837
