ONE YEAR LATER

00:45.620 --> 00:50.610
Banks should be helping out
in times of crisis like this.

00:51.660 --> 00:57.020
I understand the exposed checks
amount to 80,000 euros for this month's end.

00:57.020 --> 01:00.780
I'm steering by sight,
it's all I can do.

01:00.880 --> 01:05.340
I think you can choose a more quiet course.

01:05.340 --> 01:09.860
This property has its own prestige after all.

01:10.820 --> 01:17.060
I know someone interested in the investment,
I think we can find a solution.

02:12.660 --> 02:17.060
Gennà!
- Hi, Gegè.

02:18.060 --> 02:23.460
So?
- He gave it up, it's ours.

02:23.460 --> 02:25.620
Good.

02:25.620 --> 02:29.500
This time the payment
must be before the selling.

02:29.500 --> 02:33.780
What's the problem?
- My friend is going through a rough patch,

02:33.780 --> 02:36.580
he needs cash quick.

02:36.580 --> 02:39.780
What do we have at hand?
- About 700,000.

02:39.780 --> 02:42.860
I need it all.
- We'll be left cleaned.

02:42.860 --> 02:49.020
Money has to be invested, right?
That's what you taught me.

02:49.880 --> 02:55.220
When do you need it?
- My friend is coming tonight. Bye, Gegè.

02:55.220 --> 02:57.550
Bye, Gennà.

04:21.459 --> 04:27.500
<b> <i>ENGLISH SUBTITLES BY BARISHNIKOV@KATCR.CO</i> </b>

05:18.060 --> 05:21.780
It's good to see you, brother.

05:23.460 --> 05:27.940
Brother... I really missed you.

05:27.990 --> 05:32.860
Let's go.
Joaquin, this is Gegè.

05:32.860 --> 05:36.200
Nice to meet you.
- How's going?

05:36.200 --> 05:41.200
My friend is the best accountant in the world.
- He's exaggerating.

05:41.200 --> 05:47.300
If it wasn't for his family, I'd be unemployed.
- Tell me about your problem.

05:47.300 --> 05:54.140
Don't worry, you can trust him.
- Those sons of bitches are already here, in Rome.

05:54.290 --> 05:59.140
Who are they?
- A shitty gang that's making war to me.

05:59.140 --> 06:05.380
If they close this deal,
I'm gonna be screwed.

06:06.580 --> 06:09.980
I have good friends among the Calabrians.

06:09.980 --> 06:14.700
I'll make a few phone calls
and see what's going on, ok?

06:14.700 --> 06:16.980
Alright.

06:16.980 --> 06:19.580
Let's go, Gegè.

06:20.140 --> 06:26.060
You must not worry.
- They're killing all my people.

06:33.280 --> 06:36.500
You're with me tonight.

06:45.820 --> 06:49.700
No, I can't walk away.

06:51.980 --> 06:56.100
Tell Giulia, 
I'll talk to her myself.

06:58.320 --> 07:00.780
Bye.

07:44.540 --> 07:49.320
I know it's not you kind of thing,
but this is an emergency.

07:49.320 --> 07:52.140
What's going on?

07:54.020 --> 07:59.820
I spoke to my friends,
this thing must be done tonight.

07:59.820 --> 08:03.300
I need your help.

08:04.500 --> 08:08.700
Is there a problem?
- No... no problem.

08:08.700 --> 08:16.020
I'm at your disposal, you know that.
- I know, I just wanted to hear it.

08:19.740 --> 08:26.020
What do they want in exchange?
- Our stuff is 23 per kilo.

08:26.020 --> 08:34.010
Your friends were selling at 29.
- Friends... those fuckers will pay for that extra 6,000.

09:18.460 --> 09:20.980
Let's go.

09:46.300 --> 09:48.940
Wait here.

10:50.260 --> 10:53.500
Honey, not now...

11:34.380 --> 11:37.180
I need you inside.

11:51.820 --> 11:57.100
We gotta hurry, 
the cleaners will be here in two hours. 

12:00.560 --> 12:03.780
Ready?
- Yes.

12:06.850 --> 12:10.540
Get a mop from the bathroom.

12:12.300 --> 12:14.900
Move it, Gegè!

13:37.700 --> 13:41.460
Let's do the other one.
- Ok, brother.

14:54.700 --> 14:57.860
Gegè, are you alright?

14:59.860 --> 15:02.380
Come.

15:24.740 --> 15:28.100
Make a nice video.

15:32.020 --> 15:34.780
Hurry!

15:36.340 --> 15:39.100
Sons of bitches!

15:39.100 --> 15:46.260
Wherever you go, this is how
you're gonna end, you pieces of shit!

15:46.260 --> 15:52.920
The Devil has come, you faggots.
We'll cut all your heads off, motherfuckers!

15:54.180 --> 15:57.340
Enough now.

16:42.220 --> 16:44.820
Get the flashlight.

16:44.820 --> 16:48.780
These motherfuckers are heavy!

17:08.339 --> 17:12.460
Here we are. Give me that one.
- This one?

17:15.000 --> 17:17.260
Here's the other one.

17:22.819 --> 17:25.780
Untie the rope, Gegè.

18:13.040 --> 18:15.820
Here is good.

18:24.860 --> 18:27.900
One, two, three.

18:34.600 --> 18:36.820
The light, Gegè.

18:50.700 --> 18:54.020
Go to hell, cowards.

19:02.180 --> 19:04.680
Go back, Gegè.

19:45.420 --> 19:49.260
I'm so sorry about Giulia.

20:01.260 --> 20:05.500
What you're doing
isn't good for you.

20:05.500 --> 20:10.740
This is giving me the chance
I never would have got otherwise.

20:15.100 --> 20:19.620
What happened tonight?
Can you tell me?

20:21.460 --> 20:27.020
I had to join him for dinner
with an important client.

20:27.620 --> 20:32.620
I never ask you questions
and I'm on your side.

20:32.880 --> 20:36.820
But you can always pull out...

20:36.920 --> 20:39.980
...if you want to.

20:43.180 --> 20:49.020
When you're back, we'll have a nice lunch.
- I'll be back in two days.

22:04.460 --> 22:08.560
Patrizia, you play hard-to-get.

22:08.560 --> 22:14.220
What do you want?
- Ma'am Scianel has a message for your friend Marinella.

22:14.220 --> 22:20.820
What's the message?
- She's pissed off, her son ended up in a grave.

22:20.990 --> 22:24.380
I know.
- Now there's the trial.

22:24.380 --> 22:28.860
Your friend needs to be nice to her.

22:28.860 --> 22:34.860
I don't know where she is.
- I'm positive you can find out.

22:35.140 --> 22:40.060
I don't think Marinella could do that.
- You talk to her,

22:40.060 --> 22:44.420
we all need a second chance, don't we?

22:44.420 --> 22:47.020
I'll see what I can do.
- Do what you want,

22:47.020 --> 22:51.620
but if Ma'am Scianel gets convicted,
the responsibility is yours.

22:51.770 --> 22:53.790
Be wise.

23:06.900 --> 23:09.660
He looks like a prince.

23:10.420 --> 23:13.510
The father is not king yet.

23:13.510 --> 23:17.540
Are you nervous?
- No.

23:21.340 --> 23:23.860
Here we are.

23:26.260 --> 23:29.940
Azzurra, you must not worry.

23:30.660 --> 23:36.540
With all the money I earned him,
your dad should build me a golden statue.

23:36.540 --> 23:40.340
You don't know him, Gennà.

23:40.700 --> 23:44.100
Do you trust me?

24:16.540 --> 24:19.220
Hello.
- Gegè.

24:19.540 --> 24:24.780
Do you remember?
<i>My father-in-law is coming home today.</i>   - Yes.

24:24.790 --> 24:28.680
<i>He'll stay 2 hours with the family,
then you come at about 2.</i>

24:28.680 --> 24:33.980
<i>He's a son of a bitch,
he must think it all belongs to him.</i>

24:33.980 --> 24:37.740
Perfect.
<i>- Do you have the papers ready?</i>

24:37.740 --> 24:40.980
Yes.
<i>- I'll see you later.</i>

25:31.760 --> 25:34.820
Shall we go meet grandpa?

25:34.920 --> 25:37.220
Let's go.

25:44.850 --> 25:50.040
The only good thing about house arrest
is that I'll get to stay with my nephew.

25:50.040 --> 25:53.740
Hi, Giuseppe.
- Come to your grandpa.

25:53.740 --> 25:59.900
Look how cute he is!

26:31.500 --> 26:37.940
Are these my "wooden heads"?
- Your companies have been signed over to them, Doctor. 

26:37.940 --> 26:42.460
If I was a doctor,
I wouldn't have been one year in jail.

26:56.100 --> 26:58.980
Is this all mine?
- Precisely.

26:58.980 --> 27:04.180
Let me show you shares and returns.
- Why, Gennà?

27:05.500 --> 27:12.940
Why what?
- We had plenty of people for this, you instead...

27:12.940 --> 27:15.980
...picked a kid from your neighborhood...

27:15.980 --> 27:21.780
...who thinks learning Italian
will scrub the stench of hunger off him.

27:23.140 --> 27:26.900
I needed someone clean,
someone unknown.

27:26.900 --> 27:31.580
The judge knows all your men.
- You know what they say?

27:31.580 --> 27:35.220
A dog only hears his master..
and this is your dog.

27:35.220 --> 27:40.900
There's no dogs here,
you're the only boss in your house.

27:40.950 --> 27:44.300
Explain the situation to him, Gegè.

27:44.300 --> 27:48.840
Before going to jail,
you had about 60 million euros.

27:48.840 --> 27:55.900
After the police liens, you were left with 1,5 millions...
- I knew that already.

27:56.220 --> 27:58.940
...all into one hidden society.

27:58.940 --> 28:07.260
Now you own 17 societies, either fully or partly,
for a total value of 97 million euros.

28:10.220 --> 28:13.340
Being inside there is hell.

28:13.340 --> 28:17.460
Then you come back home
and life has moved on.

28:17.460 --> 28:22.740
You feel like a stranger
even inside your own family.

28:22.740 --> 28:28.660
Everyone you used to love...
you see them as strangers.

28:31.940 --> 28:36.700
You're no longer in jail, Giusè.
You want back your own consultants?

28:36.700 --> 28:39.420
Gegè can step aside any time.

28:39.420 --> 28:44.260
You want your "wooden heads"?
The notary will take care of that.

28:44.260 --> 28:49.100
I'm fine with anything you wanna do.

28:56.980 --> 29:00.780
But don't tell me I'm a stranger.

29:00.780 --> 29:05.820
I'm your daughter's husband,
your grandson's father.

29:05.820 --> 29:09.700
Don't ever forget that.

29:09.700 --> 29:15.580
That's exactly what I don't want to forget.

29:30.100 --> 29:33.380
Hello?
- It's Patrizia.

29:36.100 --> 29:41.460
I'm glad you're ok.
- I didn't call to say hello.

29:44.740 --> 29:49.020
A common friend is making a fuss.

29:49.020 --> 29:53.020
I need to see you and tell you everything.

29:53.120 --> 29:56.660
Tonight is good.
Where?

29:58.340 --> 30:00.900
I'll text you.

30:58.540 --> 31:00.940
Hi, Gennà.

31:01.580 --> 31:03.780
Come in.

31:03.990 --> 31:07.900
Coffee?
- Thanks.

31:20.200 --> 31:24.190
What is it?
You don't like my place?

31:25.020 --> 31:28.300
You chose it.

31:41.140 --> 31:44.340
They live there.

31:45.300 --> 31:48.100
My brothers.

31:48.460 --> 31:54.340
When they see me in the street,
they cross to the other side.

31:54.340 --> 31:58.500
Soon I won't even be able
to watch them from here.

32:01.140 --> 32:02.700
Why?

32:02.700 --> 32:07.340
My brother left school and went to work.

32:08.100 --> 32:11.740
Now I found out he lost his job too.

32:11.740 --> 32:16.100
Social workers came around already.

32:16.540 --> 32:23.060
Next time they'll take the kids,
I won't even be able to see them.

32:24.820 --> 32:28.380
What do you want from me?

32:30.300 --> 32:35.060
A job for my brother.
An honest job.

32:35.620 --> 32:38.980
Not in Naples though.

32:38.980 --> 32:43.620
My family must get out of this hell.

32:46.260 --> 32:50.340
Tomorrow your brother will have the job.

32:59.780 --> 33:05.140
He can't know who got him the job.
- Alright.

33:05.340 --> 33:09.860
Now what about our common friend?

33:11.860 --> 33:17.540
Scianel contacted me,
she has a proposal for Marinella.

33:17.540 --> 33:21.580
She wants me to find her,
what do I do?

33:23.940 --> 33:30.660
Do what she told you.
I'm more comfortable if you're near her anyway.

35:25.980 --> 35:30.180
Can I help you?
- I'm looking for Irene.

35:30.190 --> 35:33.660
Irene!
<i>- Coming!</i>

35:44.780 --> 35:52.700
I have no regrets, I'd do the same thing 
100 more times, tell it to that Scianel bitch!

35:52.850 --> 35:56.580
What did you get from it, Marinella?
- Justice!

35:56.580 --> 36:02.060
The dead don't give a shit about justice.
- Of all people, you say that?

36:02.060 --> 36:06.500
You forgot about what you had me
do to Lelluccio?

36:06.770 --> 36:09.820
I don't understand you.

36:11.100 --> 36:16.260
Marinella... she'll find you,
just like I did.

36:16.260 --> 36:20.780
Only the next one coming
won't be carrying a backpack.

36:21.420 --> 36:26.220
As for me, I work for myself,
mind my own fucking business.

36:27.580 --> 36:33.300
Do you work for the Savastanos?
- I told you what I had to tell.

36:35.700 --> 36:42.220
Sooner or later, she'll have to eat dust.
Promise me that.

36:48.020 --> 36:51.300
30 now and 30 after.

37:06.420 --> 37:11.260
It's not from me.
- I meant to, so it's yours.

37:11.260 --> 37:15.100
Yes but it's not my money.

37:17.900 --> 37:22.890
I spent half my life listening to my father
complain about money shortage...

37:22.890 --> 37:27.300
...and the other half trying to understand
how money works and you know what?

37:27.300 --> 37:31.120
Money's worth shit.

37:31.120 --> 37:35.580
It's not important how you get it.

37:37.060 --> 37:44.220
What's important is nobody will
take this day away from your daughter.

38:13.480 --> 38:16.460
Silvano?
- Yes.

38:16.460 --> 38:19.280
Silvano Romini?
- Yes.

38:19.280 --> 38:22.620
She must be Giulia then.
- Who are you?

38:22.620 --> 38:24.660
Someone who can no longer sleep.
- Dad!

38:24.660 --> 38:27.260
Let her go!
- Why would I?

38:27.260 --> 38:32.940
In my own house, in my own bed,
I see a stranger with my own eyes...

38:32.940 --> 38:37.580
...and it's also because of our friend.
- What's he saying?

38:37.580 --> 38:41.180
Tell your daughter,
for her own good.

38:41.180 --> 38:45.420
And explain it to me too!
- I know nothing.

38:45.420 --> 38:50.220
Bullshit!
I wanna know the truth!

38:50.220 --> 38:54.860
Tell it to that faggot Gegè!

39:08.980 --> 39:12.100
Aren't you in London?
- Giulia's in danger.

39:12.100 --> 39:14.260
What do you mean?

39:14.260 --> 39:16.860
He stopped us in the street.
- Who?

39:16.860 --> 39:20.180
Your friend's father-in-law.
- What did he want?

39:20.180 --> 39:23.320
He wants his son-in-law's head.
- Why...

39:23.320 --> 39:30.220
What the fuck do I know?
Have you tried to screw him? You tell me!

39:33.380 --> 39:38.100
You can't stay clean
working for these people.

39:41.180 --> 39:45.660
I fear for Giulia,
what can we do?

40:22.700 --> 40:25.740
What do you want from me?

40:33.820 --> 40:37.100
Gennaro is fucking me.

40:37.100 --> 40:41.820
I can feel it... I know it.

40:41.850 --> 40:44.940
Isn't that so?

40:53.860 --> 40:57.340
I wanna know how.

40:58.660 --> 41:02.700
If I do this,
Gennaro will kill me.

41:02.700 --> 41:06.540
If you don't, 
I kill you and your friend.

41:06.540 --> 41:10.660
Gegè, you are good.

41:11.020 --> 41:17.860
Otherwise Gennaro wouldn't have hired you
and I'd already know how he's fucking me.

41:21.220 --> 41:25.500
You must decide who's your boss,
right now.

41:30.940 --> 41:34.220
This is a very nice hotel.

41:34.220 --> 41:37.380
How long did you take, Gegè?
- He was very accommodating.

41:37.380 --> 41:41.380
Did he cause any trouble?
- Not at all.

41:41.380 --> 41:47.460
How about this, huh?
- This is the most wonderful view, brother!

41:48.100 --> 41:51.900
Show him the pictures, Gegè.

41:56.780 --> 42:00.060
What a classy hotel.

42:00.060 --> 42:02.900
True quality.

42:02.900 --> 42:07.140
The most amazing business
of my whole life.

42:07.140 --> 42:13.260
Isn't that right, Gegè?
- Don't talk while you eat, shut up.

42:13.660 --> 42:18.020
Girls, here's to you.

42:24.650 --> 42:28.780
Tomorrow you'll have 25% of this resort...

42:28.780 --> 42:32.780
...and after the shipment,
you'll have the other 25%.

42:32.780 --> 42:36.060
For a total of...?

42:36.160 --> 42:40.220
Gegè! Are you sleeping?
- Sorry, Gennà... you said...

42:40.220 --> 42:44.700
How much do we get with this hotel?
- 10 million euros.

42:44.700 --> 42:52.300
More than what I owed you
and you're left with the property of half the hotel.

42:52.380 --> 43:00.140
Good, brother. I never invested in Europe
but it sounds like a good idea.

43:09.220 --> 43:13.140
Till death, brother.
- Always.

43:16.140 --> 43:18.540
Always.

43:22.200 --> 43:24.420
Captain!

43:50.380 --> 43:55.300
Everything alright, Gegè?
- Yes.

43:56.980 --> 44:00.020
I'll see you tomorrow.

45:28.580 --> 45:32.660
Azzurra, where were you?
- Hi, love.

45:32.660 --> 45:37.380
Mom woke up and dad wasn't in bed.

45:37.380 --> 45:40.820
He got out.

45:41.500 --> 45:47.020
Where did he go?
- He wouldn't say.

45:54.940 --> 45:59.260
Is there something wrong, Gennà?

45:59.260 --> 46:03.140
Everything's fine, Azzurra.

46:11.580 --> 46:18.020
Happy birthday to you!

46:33.000 --> 46:37.380
Wait for me,
grandpa's got you a present.

46:45.860 --> 46:48.100
Hurry up.

47:03.300 --> 47:07.820
He gave it his son't name.
- What is it?

47:07.820 --> 47:13.620
The shell company he created to fuck me.

47:16.060 --> 47:20.060
I see a shipment here...

47:20.260 --> 47:24.540
...that he's about to sell on his own.

47:28.300 --> 47:34.020
That stuff is not for the Rome market,
nor for the Naples clans.

47:36.660 --> 47:40.660
Son of a bitch!

47:41.340 --> 47:46.820
He's fucking us all.
- What will you do?

47:47.620 --> 47:52.030
We wait till the shipment is here...

47:52.030 --> 47:56.100
...then I get rid of him.

47:57.980 --> 48:03.300
