Earl, time to play

00:07.313 --> 00:10.032
Sleep with, sleep with,

00:11.034 --> 00:11.983
Nice.

00:12.035 --> 00:14.669
Okay, Max,
the dude at table ten.

00:14.671 --> 00:17.905
Is there a "Throw food
in the cage and run" category?

00:18.407 --> 00:19.340
Hey, jump in.

00:19.342 --> 00:20.925

Sleep with, or Kill:"

00:22.878 --> 00:24.929
No, if I slept with
anyone in this diner,

00:24.931 --> 00:27.715
I'd kill myself.

00:27.717 --> 00:29.050
Even in a fictional scenario,

00:29.052 --> 00:31.436
I cannot permit myself
to go there.

00:31.438 --> 00:33.771
Girl, you'd take the fun
out of the punch bowl

00:33.773 --> 00:35.690
full of cocaine.

00:35.692 --> 00:37.692
Okay, fine.

00:37.994 --> 00:40.228
Sleep with Earl,
marry you.

00:40.230 --> 00:41.896
Not us!
Jeez.

00:41.898 --> 00:43.597
What are you, a freak?

00:43.599 --> 00:47.151
I feel uncomfortable,
Caroline.

00:47.153 --> 00:50.455
Like, I don't know
how to look at you anymore.

00:50.457 --> 00:53.941
Now, I can only see you
in a creepy lady tux.

00:53.943 --> 00:55.793
You said it
was just a game!

00:55.795 --> 00:58.748
I'm not in love with you.
Back off!

01:00.750 --> 01:02.133
It was just a joke, Earl.

01:02.135 --> 01:04.084
The things we say
in jest, darling.

01:04.087 --> 01:06.921

Oh, my God, look at the RSVP
list for our opening party.

01:25.744 --> 01:27.911
Max's Homemade Cupcakes
is at capacity.

01:28.213 --> 01:29.496
Hey, we might
even be overbooked,

01:29.498 --> 01:30.997
because in my experience,
even when guys

01:30.999 --> 01:33.266
say they're not going
to come, they do.

01:36.204 --> 01:37.904
Caroline, booth two
has been waiting

01:37.906 --> 01:39.473
for service
for ten minutes!

01:39.475 --> 01:41.341
And Han knows
how frustrating that is,

01:41.343 --> 01:44.395
'cause he's been waiting
to be serviced for years.

01:45.397 --> 01:47.397
Not that it's any
of your business, Max,

01:47.399 --> 01:50.018
but I have a very active
sex life.

01:52.820 --> 01:55.322
So then, Han, will you be
bringing a date tomorrow night?

01:55.324 --> 01:57.692
Ah, no.

01:58.694 --> 02:03.163
You do understand that sex
involves two people, right?

02:03.165 --> 02:07.417
And that one of those people
has to be you?

02:07.419 --> 02:08.752
What is all this dirty talk?

02:08.753 --> 02:11.922
This is a diner,
not a dirty talking place.

02:12.424 --> 02:14.040
Sorry, Han, I know
we still work here at night.

02:14.042 --> 02:15.625
I'll go right over
to the booth.

02:15.627 --> 02:17.794
We were just talking
about our big opening party.

02:17.796 --> 02:21.164
All you ever talk
about is your big opening.

02:21.866 --> 02:24.301
Now who has
the potty mouth?

02:29.056 --> 02:30.807
Max, I need
your guest list names.

02:30.809 --> 02:32.859
Oh, okay, I'm still waiting
for them to confirm,

02:32.861 --> 02:34.194
so just put me down
for ten.

02:34.196 --> 02:36.229
Okay, but I need
their names asap.

02:36.231 --> 02:37.480
I'm running
a tight door.

02:37.482 --> 02:38.565
I got a bouncer
from a local club

02:38.567 --> 02:39.983
to donate his time.

02:39.985 --> 02:43.436
I told him it
was a charity event for eczema.

02:43.438 --> 02:46.206
What? We'll make a big donation
when we're successful,

02:46.208 --> 02:47.624
but, for tomorrow,
every now and then,

02:47.626 --> 02:50.243
scratch a little?

02:50.245 --> 02:53.413
Hi, everybody!
I got great news.

02:53.415 --> 02:57.884
What? You finally found
the thing we lost in there?

02:57.886 --> 03:02.622
No. I knew we should've
tied a string on it.

03:02.624 --> 03:05.842
No, look.
I got a fax from Poland.

03:05.844 --> 03:08.461
My dream house is done!
Isn't it amazing?

03:08.463 --> 03:09.896
It is amazing.

03:09.898 --> 03:13.149
I haven't seen a fax
in, like, five years.

03:13.151 --> 03:15.068
Sophie, it's so pretty!

03:15.070 --> 03:16.569
Look at all this sweet
gingerbread woodwork

03:16.571 --> 03:17.570
on the porch.

03:17.572 --> 03:18.855
Oh, I'm so excited.

03:18.857 --> 03:20.806
I'm going to be
on Air Poland flight

03:20.808 --> 03:22.609
right after big party.

03:22.611 --> 03:25.662
You are going to Poland?
That's news.

03:25.664 --> 03:27.113
And when were you
going to tell me?

03:27.115 --> 03:29.115
Um, now, yeah.

03:29.117 --> 03:31.000
Um, I'm going to be gone
for a month.

03:31.002 --> 03:32.535
Oh, okay.

03:32.537 --> 03:34.087
It will be good
to have some time away

03:34.089 --> 03:36.539
from the old ball and chain.

03:36.541 --> 03:39.125
Yeah, he's not talking
about me.

03:39.127 --> 03:41.879
We use a ball and chain
in our lovemaking.

03:42.881 --> 03:45.133
That's the thing
I can't find.

03:48.036 --> 03:49.335
All right.

03:49.336 --> 03:51.020
Okay, yeah.

03:51.022 --> 03:52.805
Well, buh-bye.

03:52.807 --> 03:56.476
I'll see you tomorrow night
at my big going away party!

03:56.478 --> 03:59.028
Sophie, the party's
for our cupcake business.

03:59.030 --> 04:03.316
Oh, see, this is why
I don't like you so much.

04:07.187 --> 04:09.372
Guys, thanks again
for donating your time.

04:09.374 --> 04:11.157
It's fundraisers like this
that will help

04:11.159 --> 04:13.494
put an end
to undescended testicles.

04:15.696 --> 04:16.629
Hi!

04:16.630 --> 04:18.363
I'd like to meet the owner
of this awesome

04:18.366 --> 04:19.999
and totally cool
cupcake shop?

04:20.000 --> 04:22.302
Oh, nevermind!
That's me.

04:22.304 --> 04:24.454
Max, you got a blow-out!

04:24.456 --> 04:25.989
Yeah, I'd figured
I finally see

04:25.991 --> 04:28.510
what all the fuss
about getting blown is.

04:30.512 --> 04:33.229
Oh, hi, we're not
quite ready for guests yet.

04:33.231 --> 04:36.566
Girl,
I'm your doorman, Nevel.

04:36.568 --> 04:38.351
Oh, I'm confused.
I thought my doorman was--

04:38.353 --> 04:40.853
Straight, white, and boring?
He was.

04:40.855 --> 04:42.655
Then, boring came down
with the flu.

04:42.657 --> 04:46.526
Now, you've got gay, black,
and definitely not boring.

04:46.528 --> 04:47.860
So what's
the charity tonight?

04:47.862 --> 04:50.280
- Eczema.
- Undescended testicles.

04:50.282 --> 04:53.783
People with eczema
<i>and</i> undescended testicles.

04:53.785 --> 04:56.621
Lord, child.
That is a cross to bear.

04:58.623 --> 04:59.923
Get me the door list,
and let's make

04:59.925 --> 05:03.042
those poor, itchy boys
some money.

05:04.411 --> 05:06.179
Another fake charity?

05:06.181 --> 05:09.582
You've got some balls,
even if they aren't descended.

05:09.584 --> 05:11.250
Max, we so lucked out.

05:11.252 --> 05:12.885
Nothing says
"successful party"

05:12.887 --> 05:15.605
like a bitchy, gay doorman!

05:15.607 --> 05:17.557
Give me your guest names.
I'll write them down.

05:17.559 --> 05:19.359
Okay, fine.

05:19.361 --> 05:23.262
Put down Tommy, Dylan,
Robbie, Johnny--

05:23.264 --> 05:25.365
Robbie and Johnny?

05:25.367 --> 05:28.234
Wait, Max, are these
all your ex-boyfriends?

05:28.236 --> 05:30.603
Perhaps.

05:30.605 --> 05:32.388
Max, the invited guests

05:32.390 --> 05:34.574
were all supposed
to be business contacts.

05:34.576 --> 05:36.576
See, this is why I didn't
tell you sooner.

05:36.578 --> 05:38.077
You're a control freak.

05:38.079 --> 05:41.113
And for the record,
these guys have all had contact

05:41.115 --> 05:43.449
with my business.

05:43.451 --> 05:45.385
You're using
our launch party

05:45.387 --> 05:47.119
to get back
at ex-boyfriends?

05:47.121 --> 05:48.954
Uh, yeah!

05:48.956 --> 05:50.506
That's what success
is for,

05:50.508 --> 05:53.125
to say "suck it"
to people who dumped you.

05:53.127 --> 05:55.178
"See my blown-out hair?
Suck it!

05:55.180 --> 05:57.230
"See my cool cupcake shop?
Suck it!

05:57.232 --> 06:01.601
See these in this blouse?
You <i>wish</i> you could suck it."

06:03.303 --> 06:06.272
And here, it is not just
boyfriends on my list.

06:06.274 --> 06:08.474
I also invited
the lady from Staples

06:08.476 --> 06:09.909
who gives me attitude.

06:09.911 --> 06:11.729
She can suck it too.

06:12.731 --> 06:14.647
Fine, but how
is inviting Johnny

06:14.649 --> 06:16.449
and his new wife
a victory?

06:16.451 --> 06:17.750
Oh, like this.

06:17.752 --> 06:19.786
"Hi, Mrs. Johnny.
Nice to meet you."

06:19.788 --> 06:21.287
You got him,
but I got these

06:21.289 --> 06:24.824
"And all this,
so suck it."

06:24.826 --> 06:26.426
I'm not so sure
this is healthy.

06:26.428 --> 06:28.044
Are you kidding me?

06:28.046 --> 06:31.547
This is the healthiest thing
I've done in my life.

06:31.549 --> 06:33.099
I even thought
about inviting my mother

06:33.101 --> 06:34.767
to come and suck it,
but then she'd realize

06:34.769 --> 06:36.686
maybe I didn't commit suicide
two years ago

06:36.688 --> 06:39.389
like my note said.

06:39.391 --> 06:41.024
I'm about ready
to open.

06:41.026 --> 06:43.226
Shouldn't we be putting up
some testicle banners,

06:43.228 --> 06:46.279
or scrotum posters,
or something?

06:46.281 --> 06:48.815
Also, there's a cute blonde boy
out here asking for you

06:48.817 --> 06:50.149
that I'm about
to eat alive.

06:50.151 --> 06:51.451
[Groans]

06:51.453 --> 06:53.453
That's Andy
with the free bar stuff.

06:53.455 --> 06:54.737
Go, I'm gonna stay here

06:54.739 --> 06:56.689
and practice my "suck it" face
for a while.

06:56.691 --> 06:58.991
How's this?

06:58.993 --> 07:01.244
That look
is so much more "suck it"

07:01.246 --> 07:02.245
with the straight hair.

07:02.247 --> 07:03.915
[Laughs]
I know, right?

07:05.917 --> 07:07.817
- There's my cute boyfriend.
- Hey.

07:07.819 --> 07:09.335
How did everything go
at Spike's Liquor?

07:09.337 --> 07:10.920
Well, I got
a little bit confused

07:10.922 --> 07:12.505
about what charity
we're pretending to help,

07:12.507 --> 07:14.340
so I told them
my sister's homeless

07:14.342 --> 07:17.042
and my balls
are up inside me.

07:17.044 --> 07:19.145
Now, we just gotta hope
Spike's not the chatty type.

07:19.147 --> 07:21.213
[Laughs]

07:21.215 --> 07:22.398
Oh! They just dropped.

07:22.400 --> 07:23.983
[Laughs]

07:23.985 --> 07:26.069
Hey, Andy, question.

07:26.071 --> 07:28.821
What does this face
say to you?

07:28.823 --> 07:31.023
I don't know,
like, "I'm cool."

07:31.025 --> 07:33.109
So close!
Guess again.

07:33.111 --> 07:34.911
Okay, like,
"I'm better than you."

07:34.913 --> 07:37.613
No, like, "I'm it,
and you can suck it."

07:37.615 --> 07:40.252
Yes! Yes!
They can suck it!

07:42.454 --> 07:43.669
Is that
what you're wearing tonight?

07:43.671 --> 07:45.755
Yeah.
No?

07:45.757 --> 07:46.956
A sweater?

07:46.958 --> 07:48.674
I always saw you
in a suit tonight.

07:48.676 --> 07:50.193
Run home real quick
and put on a suit.

07:50.195 --> 07:52.879
Hurry, people
are starting to come.

07:52.881 --> 07:54.264
Uh, Max is still
making the face.

07:55.266 --> 07:56.849
I know.
I can't stop.

07:56.851 --> 07:58.603
I've waited my whole life
to make this face.

08:00.605 --> 08:02.889
[Giggles]

08:02.891 --> 08:04.440
Max, look.

08:04.442 --> 08:06.058
Our business is open.

08:06.060 --> 08:07.694
Wait, wait, wait.
Not quite.

08:08.696 --> 08:12.865
In five, four,
three, two.

08:12.867 --> 08:15.067
Both: Whoo!

08:16.870 --> 08:18.938
- Name, please?
- Sophie Kuchenski.

08:18.940 --> 08:22.241
Guest of honor.
[Cheering]

08:22.243 --> 08:25.611
- How many in your party?
- See, I <i>knew</i> it was my party!

[Cheering and clapping]

08:33.220 --> 08:35.087
[Lounge music]

08:35.388 --> 08:37.556
Max, there's a line
all the way down the hall

08:37.557 --> 08:39.457
and I've given out,
like, a hundred business cards!

08:39.457 --> 08:43.695
You know what that means?
Being poor can suck it!

08:43.995 --> 08:46.030
Girl, the Fire Marshal
just dropped by,

08:46.032 --> 08:48.049
and told me
we can't let anymore people in

08:48.051 --> 08:49.767
till some of these folks
go out.

08:49.769 --> 08:52.620
Nevel, none of my guests
are even here yet.

08:52.622 --> 08:54.488
It is very important
to let in any guy

08:54.490 --> 08:56.574
who looks hot, but you know
would screw you over.

08:56.576 --> 08:58.460
Is there any other type?

08:59.462 --> 09:01.630
I'll go get
some more cupcakes.

09:02.632 --> 09:04.131
Hey!
How's it going so far, babe?

09:04.133 --> 09:05.333
Andy, what are you doing?

09:05.335 --> 09:06.867
I told you to come back
in a suit.

09:06.869 --> 09:08.553
Yeah, I know,
but I like what I'm wearing.

09:09.055 --> 09:10.838
So you're telling me
you'll just go

09:10.840 --> 09:12.473
and do what you want,
no matter how much

09:12.475 --> 09:13.707
I try to control you?

09:14.509 --> 09:15.893
Yeah.

09:15.895 --> 09:17.679
That is so freaking hot.

09:18.681 --> 09:20.232
Caroline!

09:21.234 --> 09:23.385
Caroline, I can't get in!

09:24.887 --> 09:27.774
Caroline! Less kissing,
more noticing me!

09:30.276 --> 09:32.443
See, I know her,
and my name's on the list.

09:32.445 --> 09:33.444
Han Lee.

09:33.446 --> 09:35.496
Honey,
if I was a fat girl,

09:35.498 --> 09:36.781
and your name was Sara Lee,

09:36.783 --> 09:39.200
you still
wouldn't be getting in.

09:39.202 --> 09:41.919
We are at capacity!

09:41.921 --> 09:44.205
Hey, Robbie.
On the list.

09:44.207 --> 09:46.376
Go right on in, child.

09:48.378 --> 09:51.014
Uh, hello?

09:53.016 --> 09:56.133
Do you need a dictionary
to define the word "capacity?"

09:56.135 --> 09:57.969
I have clear orders:

09:57.971 --> 10:00.087
Only very hot men
who look like trouble.

10:00.089 --> 10:02.256
Mm-hmm.

10:06.945 --> 10:08.779
Excuse me, you know
where I can find Max?

10:08.781 --> 10:11.098
- Yes, she's in the back.
- Cool.

10:11.100 --> 10:13.451
Robbie, it's me,
Caroline.

10:13.453 --> 10:15.436
Oh, sorry.

10:15.438 --> 10:17.238
Did we have sex?

10:17.240 --> 10:18.489
What? No!

10:18.491 --> 10:19.907
I'm Max's roommate.

10:19.909 --> 10:22.576
Oh, Max had a roommate?

10:22.578 --> 10:24.245
I was pretty much wasted
the whole time.

10:24.247 --> 10:26.497
I remember,
like, nothing,

10:26.499 --> 10:30.001
but I'm in the program now,
so it's one day at a time.

10:30.003 --> 10:32.803
- Well, Max is through there.
- [Chuckles] Cool.

10:32.805 --> 10:34.755
But we did have sex, right?

10:34.757 --> 10:36.623
No!
We did not have sex.

10:36.625 --> 10:38.759
You offered,
but I wasn't into you.

10:38.761 --> 10:39.977
[Chuckles]

10:39.979 --> 10:41.164
Yeah, right.

10:45.517 --> 10:47.603
- Hey, Max.
- Robbie!

10:49.605 --> 10:50.988
Why are you
making that face?

10:50.990 --> 10:53.190
You have a toothache
or something?

10:53.192 --> 10:56.444
No, it's--
I'm successful now

10:56.446 --> 10:57.862
and this is my shop.

10:57.864 --> 10:59.980
Wow. Cool.

10:59.982 --> 11:02.583
So listen,
I'm an alcoholic now,

11:02.585 --> 11:04.818
and I did a lot of stuff
that wasn't cool,

11:04.820 --> 11:06.620
and I came here
because the program

11:06.622 --> 11:08.823
says that I have
to make almonds.

11:11.960 --> 11:13.511
"Almonds"?

11:13.513 --> 11:16.430
You mean "amends"?

11:16.432 --> 11:20.101
Cool. So, look,
I cheated on you

11:20.103 --> 11:22.887
behind your back,
like, every day.

11:23.389 --> 11:25.940
Well, um, we don't have
to go into all this now.

11:25.942 --> 11:27.391
It's kind of a big night
for me.

11:27.393 --> 11:29.894
And I stole money
from you too,

11:29.896 --> 11:32.030
like, every time
we had sex.

11:33.032 --> 11:35.066
But we had a <i>lot</i>
of sex.

11:35.068 --> 11:36.233
[Chuckles]
I know.

11:36.235 --> 11:38.353
Well, I stole a lot
of money.

11:39.355 --> 11:42.623
Well, this just went
from "suck it" to "it sucks,"

11:42.625 --> 11:44.458
so lift up your shirt.

11:44.460 --> 11:46.112
I gotta get something
out of tonight.

11:46.914 --> 11:48.498
[Inhales sharply]

11:48.514 --> 11:50.298
Money well spent.

11:53.535 --> 11:55.336
Just found out
I paid for more sex

11:55.338 --> 11:58.039
than an Arab businessman.

11:59.041 --> 12:00.541
Maybe this wasn't
the healthiest thing

12:00.543 --> 12:01.708
I could've done tonight.

12:01.710 --> 12:03.060
So what do you
wanna do?

12:03.062 --> 12:05.263
Should I tell Nevel
to keep Johnny out?

12:06.265 --> 12:08.649
Too late.
Way too late.

12:08.651 --> 12:09.934
Max.

12:09.936 --> 12:12.269
[Weakly]
Hi.

12:12.271 --> 12:14.388
You look even better
than I remember.

12:14.390 --> 12:17.024
Well, I should.
I just got blown.

12:17.026 --> 12:18.609
[Chuckles]

12:18.611 --> 12:21.612
Suck it, suck it,
suck it, suck it.

12:21.614 --> 12:23.080
Max, this place
is so awesome.

12:23.082 --> 12:24.548
It's like
you're telling everybody

12:24.550 --> 12:26.534
who ever doubted you
to suck it.

12:26.536 --> 12:30.121
No, we're not petty
like that.

12:30.123 --> 12:31.738
Hey, it's a little loud
in here.

12:31.740 --> 12:33.057
You wanna talk
in the hall?

12:33.059 --> 12:36.627
Uh, wait, let me take a look
around my big, successful shop.

12:36.629 --> 12:37.945
Yeah, I can go.

12:38.747 --> 12:39.930
Keep your eye on Max.

12:39.932 --> 12:41.265
That guy
in the Brad Pitt glasses

12:41.267 --> 12:42.918
broke her heart,
and I don't trust him.

12:44.720 --> 12:46.053
Max, you look insanely good.

12:46.555 --> 12:47.471
Thanks.

12:47.473 --> 12:49.523
Now, maybe you could repeat that
to your wife,

12:49.525 --> 12:51.642
and where is she?

12:51.644 --> 12:52.926
We never got married.

12:52.928 --> 12:56.113
Max! Max!
I can't get in!

12:56.115 --> 12:59.066
Wait, what do you mean
you didn't get married?

12:59.068 --> 13:03.287
Johnny!
Hey, Johnny, I'm back here!

13:03.289 --> 13:04.405
I didn't know
if I was gonna tell you,

13:04.407 --> 13:05.606
but then I got your invite--

13:05.608 --> 13:08.910
Max! Johnny!
I'm back here!

13:09.912 --> 13:11.278
Should we just
go say "hi"?

13:11.280 --> 13:12.997
Uh, no,
not right now.

13:12.999 --> 13:16.467
Max! Max!
I can't get in!

13:16.469 --> 13:19.470
Max! Johnny!

13:19.472 --> 13:21.839
Max, I've been thinking
about you a lot.

13:21.841 --> 13:24.308
Stop. Before you
say anything else,

13:24.310 --> 13:25.894
I just have to say

13:26.696 --> 13:28.264
I need candy.

13:30.766 --> 13:32.983
[Mumbling] All right,
what were you saying?

13:32.985 --> 13:35.821
I called off the wedding
because she wasn't the one,

13:36.823 --> 13:39.023
and you wanna know
how I know that?

13:39.025 --> 13:40.024
[Banging on glass]

13:40.026 --> 13:43.027
Max! Johnny!

13:43.029 --> 13:45.496
I can't get
into the party!

13:45.498 --> 13:46.847
Come here.

13:46.849 --> 13:48.282
Help me out!

13:48.284 --> 13:49.700
Seriously!

13:49.702 --> 13:51.087
That doorman
is a biatch!

13:56.258 --> 13:58.092
Okay, so, uh--

13:58.094 --> 14:00.261
[gasps]

14:01.213 --> 14:02.513
Wait, what are we doing?

14:02.515 --> 14:03.881
Making out
in a room full of candy.

14:03.883 --> 14:06.967
Right.

14:06.969 --> 14:08.219
No, no, this can't happen.

14:08.221 --> 14:09.854
I was gonna give you
my "suck it" face.

14:09.856 --> 14:12.025
Okay, give it to me.
I deserve it.

14:15.027 --> 14:17.645
Your "suck it" face
is hot.

14:17.647 --> 14:19.613
It's the hair.

14:19.615 --> 14:21.532
[Moaning]

14:21.534 --> 14:22.401
Ow!

14:24.403 --> 14:26.820
- [Sighs]
- [Giggles]

14:35.497 --> 14:37.733
Greatest night
of my life!

14:51.117 --> 14:52.368
[clears throat]

14:52.370 --> 14:55.221
Disclaimer:
This is not my T-shirt,

14:55.223 --> 14:58.557
though I am
all about the Girl Power.

14:58.559 --> 15:00.509
Disclaimer:
It's not my T-shirt either.

15:00.511 --> 15:03.796
Some nerd left it in the dryer
at the laundromat.

15:03.798 --> 15:04.983
It's mine.

15:06.985 --> 15:09.151
Girl Power!

15:09.153 --> 15:10.987
No way.
No way!

15:10.989 --> 15:12.938
Do I smell
chocolate chips?

15:12.940 --> 15:15.891
And is Uncle Andy
making pancakes?

15:15.893 --> 15:18.194
You do,
and I am.

15:18.196 --> 15:20.646
Dude, I don't know you,
but chocolate chip pancakes

15:20.648 --> 15:22.299
are the balls.

15:23.901 --> 15:25.067
How did you two sleep?

15:25.069 --> 15:27.036
Did we sleep?

15:27.538 --> 15:30.255
Great! So what's
gonna happen now?

15:30.257 --> 15:31.540
I meant today,
at the shop,

15:31.542 --> 15:32.925
our big first day
in business!

15:32.927 --> 15:34.459
You thought I was talking
about you two?

15:34.461 --> 15:35.928
Plbbt! I don't care
about you two.

15:35.930 --> 15:38.780
Plbbt! Nobody cares
about you two.

15:38.832 --> 15:41.467
Well, first, we have
to clean the party mess up.

15:41.469 --> 15:42.718
Andy and I
did it last night

15:42.720 --> 15:44.687
when you didn't come back.

15:44.689 --> 15:46.889
Um, can someone here
mellow out

15:46.891 --> 15:50.025
and put some pancakes
in her pancake hole?

15:50.027 --> 15:51.443
No, Caroline,
I get it.

15:51.445 --> 15:53.696
It's been a rocky ride
for Max and me.

15:53.698 --> 15:55.397
See, when we met,
I had a girlfriend.

15:55.399 --> 15:56.815
Which he never told her
about, and--

15:56.817 --> 15:58.684
And keep eating.

15:58.686 --> 16:00.185
And because of that,
Max and I

16:00.187 --> 16:01.537
never really
got together,

16:01.539 --> 16:02.988
and then that girl and I
broke up,

16:02.990 --> 16:05.023
and by the time
I saw Max again, I was--

16:05.025 --> 16:07.042
Engaged to be married?

16:07.044 --> 16:09.128
Yeah, yeah,
I was gonna get married.

16:09.130 --> 16:10.862
Wait, to that
same girlfriend?

16:10.864 --> 16:12.383
Different one.
Different one.

16:14.385 --> 16:15.867
Yeah, but that
didn't work out either,

16:15.869 --> 16:17.052
and I've had a couple
girlfriends since--

16:17.054 --> 16:20.255
[mumbling]
Oh! Only a couple!

16:20.257 --> 16:22.675
Yeah, none of them
seemed to work out.

16:22.677 --> 16:24.876
None of them are Max.

16:27.097 --> 16:28.564
Hey, save me a pancake.

16:28.566 --> 16:31.385
It looks like Caroline
has plans to eat them all.

16:33.387 --> 16:35.437
Well, Max, as far
as the "suck it" plan goes,

16:35.439 --> 16:37.725
it looks like somebody
sucked something.

16:42.662 --> 16:45.614
Pancakes, pancake hole.

16:45.616 --> 16:46.615
He's a good guy.

16:46.617 --> 16:48.117
Yeah, he seems cool.

16:48.119 --> 16:50.753
Kinda falls in love a lot,
but hey...

16:50.755 --> 16:52.338
And I did not tell him
to say that.

16:52.340 --> 16:54.707
He never does what I say.
It's hot.

16:54.709 --> 16:57.376
"But hey" what?

16:57.378 --> 16:58.761
Oh, we're continuing?

16:58.763 --> 16:59.879
Um, I don't know.

16:59.881 --> 17:01.881
Maybe I'm partial,
but Max,

17:01.883 --> 17:03.132
you're an "A."

17:03.134 --> 17:04.300
He kind of seems
like a "B."

17:04.301 --> 17:06.102
Minus.

17:06.104 --> 17:07.720
First of all,
look at me.

17:07.722 --> 17:11.507
I am clearly a "D,"

17:11.509 --> 17:14.310
and I don't think
he falls in love a lot.

17:14.311 --> 17:17.512
Man, I love, love,
love pancakes.

17:17.515 --> 17:21.117
If I could,
I would marry a pancake.

17:29.126 --> 17:30.794
What time is it?

17:31.796 --> 17:32.880
10:20.

17:35.582 --> 17:36.499
Well, it's the first day open.

17:36.501 --> 17:38.367
All those people are probably
tired from the party.

17:38.369 --> 17:39.701
Yeah.

17:39.703 --> 17:41.370
Oh, and look!
We forgot to light it up.

17:41.372 --> 17:42.421
People don't know
we're open.

17:42.423 --> 17:44.540
[Laughs]

17:44.542 --> 17:48.511
In five, four,
three, two.

17:48.513 --> 17:51.380
Both: Whoo!

17:51.382 --> 17:53.551
- Go to work.
- [Sighs]

17:59.072 --> 18:01.275
- First day!
- Yep.

18:03.277 --> 18:04.911
No one's here.

18:05.913 --> 18:07.780
Remember: All we have to sell
is 70 cupcakes a day

18:07.782 --> 18:09.098
to keep on track.

18:09.100 --> 18:11.367
70 cupcakes?
That's not so hard.

18:13.987 --> 18:15.339
Maybe we should
do the light again.

18:17.541 --> 18:21.360
In five, four,
three, two.

18:21.362 --> 18:23.296
Both: Whoo!

18:26.766 --> 18:28.468
What time is it now?

18:32.488 --> 18:35.140
Tomorrow, we only need
to sell 140 cupcakes.

18:35.142 --> 18:38.277
140 cupcakes!
That's not so hard.

18:38.279 --> 18:40.196
How many
did we sell today?

18:40.198 --> 18:42.231
Four.

18:42.233 --> 18:44.450
And all were
to Johnny.

18:44.452 --> 18:46.368
I think I've made
a terrible mistake.

18:46.370 --> 18:47.903
It's only
been three days.

18:47.905 --> 18:49.038
Business will pick up.

18:49.040 --> 18:50.573
No, with Johnny.

18:50.875 --> 18:52.992
It's different now
that he's available.

18:53.494 --> 18:55.327
Maybe I'm the kind of person
who only wants something

18:55.329 --> 18:56.712
they can't have,
and then when they get it,

18:56.714 --> 18:58.497
they don't want it anymore.

18:58.499 --> 19:01.917
Okay, but do you feel that way
about the cupcake shop too?

19:01.919 --> 19:04.169
No, I love
our cupcake shop.

19:04.171 --> 19:05.554
Wow, that's the first time
I've ever said

19:05.556 --> 19:07.756
I loved anything
out loud,

19:07.758 --> 19:09.677
except for Robitussin.

19:11.679 --> 19:12.845
It's Johnny.

19:13.347 --> 19:14.730
Well, I know
what I have to do.

19:14.732 --> 19:16.965
Max, you can't change
your mind about him now.

19:16.967 --> 19:19.318
He's our only customer!

19:19.320 --> 19:22.238
By the way,
I've always loved him.

19:22.240 --> 19:24.023
Hey, guys.

19:24.025 --> 19:25.941
Um, could we talk
in the kitchen?

19:26.443 --> 19:27.159
Yeah.

19:27.161 --> 19:29.161
Wait, before you go,
I just wanna say

19:29.163 --> 19:30.646
that no matter
what goes down in life,

19:30.648 --> 19:32.915
we are always open
to your business.

19:36.536 --> 19:39.255
We're either
gonna have crazy kitchen sex

19:39.257 --> 19:40.873
or I'm getting expelled.

19:40.875 --> 19:42.374
We're not having
kitchen sex.

19:42.376 --> 19:43.993
It's way too dirty
in here

19:44.995 --> 19:46.913
from other people
having kitchen sex.

19:48.215 --> 19:50.049
So I'm getting expelled?

19:50.551 --> 19:52.968
It's weird, right?
Between us?

19:52.970 --> 19:54.503
Yeah, I don't know
what it is.

19:54.505 --> 19:58.557
Maybe it's an absence
of a lot of candy...

19:58.559 --> 19:59.608
[Chuckles]

19:59.610 --> 20:01.310
But it's not the same.

20:01.312 --> 20:03.562
Max! Johnny!
I thought I heard you.

20:05.649 --> 20:07.015
Max!
[Banging on door]

20:07.017 --> 20:08.317
I can't get out!

20:08.319 --> 20:09.818
Maybe we're only
at our best

20:09.820 --> 20:12.121
when you have
another girlfriend.

20:12.123 --> 20:13.822
Maybe give me a call
when you get that going

20:13.824 --> 20:15.074
in, like, ten minutes.

20:15.076 --> 20:16.575
[Laughs]

20:16.577 --> 20:18.744
Or I could just call you
on my actual wedding day.

20:19.546 --> 20:21.330
Oh, cool!
Yeah, just call me 30 minutes

20:21.332 --> 20:23.365
before the service,
and I'll be there.

20:23.367 --> 20:26.001
Or better yet, call me at, like,
your 50th wedding anniversary.

20:26.003 --> 20:28.537
Yeah,
now that's hot.

20:28.539 --> 20:29.972
Max!
[Banging on door]

20:29.974 --> 20:32.710
Johnny!
I'm cold!

20:34.712 --> 20:36.563
Kiss good-bye?

20:37.565 --> 20:40.484
Seriously, guys,
I can't feel my toes!

20:43.186 --> 20:46.022
See, it's hot again
'cause we broke up!

20:47.024 --> 20:49.074
I'll see you at my 50th,

20:49.076 --> 20:50.577
if not before.

20:51.579 --> 20:53.779
[Banging on door]

20:56.116 --> 20:57.916
First the party,
now this.

20:57.918 --> 21:00.787
When I have a party,
you won't be on the list.

21:01.789 --> 21:03.288
You're right.
I deserve that.

21:03.290 --> 21:05.124
No, I was doing
a power move.

21:05.126 --> 21:06.927
Please, I'm begging you
to come.

21:09.429 --> 21:10.095
We'll see.

21:10.097 --> 21:11.347
I might be a little too busy

21:11.349 --> 21:13.882
with my big, successful
cupcake shop,

21:13.884 --> 21:15.104
so suck it.
