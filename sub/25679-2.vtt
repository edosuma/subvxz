Princess mad about, like,
a dumb little argument.

00:07.874 --> 00:09.943
{\an8}Why get mad, right?
I dip, I go to Vegas.

00:10.009 --> 00:12.011
{\an7}Some chick come to the room
that the homie invite,

00:12.078 --> 00:14.080
{\an8}take a picture,
DM her.

00:14.147 --> 00:16.383
{\an8}I moved out of the house.

00:16.449 --> 00:21.788
{\an8}She says, "The problem is,
women think he will change.

00:21.855 --> 00:23.189
{\an7}He won't."

00:23.256 --> 00:26.459
{\an8}No wife should take
their business out

00:26.526 --> 00:28.261
{\an8}and put it
on social media.

00:28.328 --> 00:31.164
{\an8}She needs to
publicly apologize.

00:31.231 --> 00:33.032
{\an7}Lyrica, what's new
with you?

00:33.099 --> 00:35.001
{\an8}I just did a show
with K. in New York.

00:35.068 --> 00:37.270
{\an8}K. Michelle?

00:35.068 --> 00:37.270
{\an9}Yeah.

00:37.337 --> 00:39.806
{\an8}We fell out because
she told the world

00:39.873 --> 00:41.975
{\an7}that I stole
her credit cards.

00:42.041 --> 00:43.610
{\an7}Bruh, I can't wait for you
to hear these records, though.

00:43.676 --> 00:45.478

Not only did I just check
Moniece at A.D.'s fashion show,

but Ray's been gone
for, like, six days.

03:16.896 --> 03:18.298
And when I posted
a subliminal meme

03:18.364 --> 03:21.935
to get his attention,
his mom starts attacking me,

03:22.001 --> 03:23.870
and his sister starts
texting me.

They don't even know
what's going on.

looking cute,

is shining brighter
than all the others.

Thank you.

03:39.752 --> 03:41.821
Wait. To who?

03:41.888 --> 03:43.623
{\an4}Marcus-- I know.
Fair question.

03:41.888 --> 03:43.623
Of course.

03:43.690 --> 03:45.291
Marcus Black?

03:43.690 --> 03:45.291
{\an1}Yeah.

03:45.358 --> 03:47.527
We took a little break,
and then that break...

03:47.594 --> 03:48.962
{\an1}did not last long,
honey.

03:49.028 --> 03:51.230
{\an1}We started spending
the holidays together--

03:51.297 --> 03:53.533
{\an1}birthday, Thanksgiving.
For Christmas,

03:53.600 --> 03:56.069
{\an1}he came over to my mom's,
in Houston.

03:56.135 --> 03:57.403
He pulled it out.

03:57.470 --> 04:00.139
{\an1}I jack-moved it while
he was showing it to Mama.

04:00.206 --> 04:02.809
{\an4}(clears throat)
Put it on my finger.
Yes, we're engaged.

04:02.875 --> 04:05.545
Marcus may not know it yet,
but we're getting married.

04:05.612 --> 04:07.080
{\an5}Got my ring on.

04:05.612 --> 04:07.080
(both)
Wait a minute.

04:07.146 --> 04:08.481
{\an1}There's nothing else
to talk about.

04:08.548 --> 04:09.916
{\an5}Time-out, back up.
Hold on.

04:08.548 --> 04:09.916
{\an3}Back up.

04:09.983 --> 04:11.317
{\an1}What?

04:11.384 --> 04:12.418
So you're claiming
an engagement

04:12.485 --> 04:13.987
and he didn't even propose
to you?

04:14.053 --> 04:15.855
{\an1}We're getting married
because-- listen.

04:15.922 --> 04:17.255
{\an1}Y'all know
I'm a born-again virgin.

04:17.322 --> 04:19.993
{\an1}My vagina is very,
very ready to rumble.

04:20.059 --> 04:21.461
So you're waiting
till marriage, right?

04:21.527 --> 04:22.762
{\an1}Waiting!

04:22.829 --> 04:25.531
I know it sounds crazy
to say that I'm engaged

04:25.598 --> 04:28.501
even though Marcus didn't
officially get down on one knee.

04:28.568 --> 04:31.604
But when we were on that beach
and he pulled this thing out,

04:31.671 --> 04:34.707
we both knew we was gonna get
married sooner than later.

04:34.774 --> 04:38.144
Marcus can move around and get
his little thang-thang on

04:38.211 --> 04:39.879
with some one-offs
here and there,

04:39.946 --> 04:43.282
but please believe he's walking
down the aisle with me.

04:43.349 --> 04:44.817
Get back to us
after you talk to Marcus.

04:44.884 --> 04:46.152
{\an5}Oh, no, she didn't.

04:44.884 --> 04:46.152
What's goin' on with you?

04:46.219 --> 04:48.588
{\an1}Because I seen
some Instagram deletes.

04:48.655 --> 04:50.623
Ray is, like, actin'
a damn fool.

04:50.690 --> 04:52.291
{\an1}You deleted the photos.
You know what happens when--

04:52.358 --> 04:53.660
{\an5}I don't care.

04:52.358 --> 04:53.660
Wait. How is this--

04:53.726 --> 04:55.194
He hasn't been home
in six days,

04:55.261 --> 04:56.929
{\an1}so I don't wanna see you,
I don't wanna think about you,

04:56.996 --> 04:58.064
I don't wanna see you
on my timeline.

04:58.131 --> 04:59.699
If Ray wants to be in Vegas

04:59.766 --> 05:02.235
and not worry about
his pregnant wife,

05:02.301 --> 05:03.736
then I don't need
to see him.

05:03.803 --> 05:06.272
I deleted all of his pictures
off of my timeline,

05:06.339 --> 05:08.441
his last name off
of my handle.

05:08.508 --> 05:10.276
And truth is,
we planned a big

05:10.343 --> 05:12.278
gender reveal party
for our friends and family,

05:12.345 --> 05:14.147
and I don't even want
to do it anymore.

05:14.213 --> 05:16.449
What's going on with you
and Miss K. Michelle?

05:16.516 --> 05:19.285
{\an1}I see you guys posting shade
back and forth online.

05:19.352 --> 05:21.587
Well, she called my phone,
and she's like,

05:21.654 --> 05:23.389
"Hey, girl,
I have a rehearsal."

05:23.456 --> 05:24.724
I show up.

05:24.791 --> 05:26.125
Girl, she was off her meds
that day.

05:26.192 --> 05:27.393
Oh, my God.

05:27.460 --> 05:29.395
All of a sudden,
"'F' you, bitches!"

05:29.462 --> 05:30.430
{\an1}Ugh!

05:29.462 --> 05:30.430
{\an3}What?

05:30.496 --> 05:31.864
"Your marriage is fake."

05:31.931 --> 05:33.433
She's talking about
my outfit.

05:33.499 --> 05:37.036
Then... in the midst
of somewhere in the argument,

05:37.103 --> 05:38.204
she's like,
"Yeah, and that's why

05:38.271 --> 05:41.274
you was trying
to (bleep) Safaree."

05:41.340 --> 05:42.675
That's not--
That's not true, right?

05:42.742 --> 05:44.510
Absolutely not true.

05:44.577 --> 05:47.246
This Lyrica and Safaree
situation

05:47.313 --> 05:48.948
is not news to Brooke, honey.

05:49.015 --> 05:52.351
I was with Lyrica and Safaree
at a Facebook Live situation,

05:52.418 --> 05:55.154
and he was flirtin'
his ass off,

05:55.221 --> 05:58.057
and Lyrica was <i> not</i>
shuttin' it down.

06:03.596 --> 06:04.797

{\an8}Things are not right
in the house of Norwood.

06:06.966 --> 06:08.701
{\an8}The minute I tell my mom about

06:08.768 --> 06:10.737
what Princess is postin'
about me,

06:10.803 --> 06:13.339
her and Brandy start
postin' stuff about Princess!

06:13.406 --> 06:15.007
I knew I would find Princess
at Lyrica's party...

06:15.074 --> 06:16.609
{\an3}Yo... hey.

06:16.676 --> 06:19.312
...so I pulled up to make sure
everything was 100 between us,

06:19.378 --> 06:21.247
'cause we got this
gender reveal party coming up.

06:21.314 --> 06:23.182
{\an1}I haven't seen you
in six days.

06:23.249 --> 06:24.517

06:23.249 --> 06:24.517
{\an1}What--

06:24.584 --> 06:26.986

to just pop up on me?

06:27.053 --> 06:28.855
{\an1}I'll pop up on you anywhere
I wanna pop up on you.

06:28.921 --> 06:33.659
Typical Ray to come home
after he's done God-knows-what.

06:33.726 --> 06:36.929
Do not try to come and stunt
on my pregnant parade, honey.

06:36.996 --> 06:40.066
I'm enjoying my time-out
just like you enjoyed yours.

06:40.133 --> 06:42.068
Look, we got
a gender reveal party

06:42.135 --> 06:45.104
{\an1}and a baby shower coming up,
and we are not on the same page,

06:45.171 --> 06:46.873
and it cannot be like that.

06:46.939 --> 06:49.275
And now things ain't right
between the family.

06:49.342 --> 06:52.311
Like, you on social media
calling me a cheater,

06:52.378 --> 06:54.580
arguing with my mom,
going back and forth

06:54.647 --> 06:58.151
{\an5}on texts with Brandy,
like, both of y'all
makin' threats.

06:58.217 --> 07:00.353
I think you should make
a public apology.

07:00.419 --> 07:02.088
Apologize to my family.

07:02.155 --> 07:03.589
Before the gender reveal
party, though.

07:03.656 --> 07:07.360
{\an1}After everything
that you put me through?

07:07.426 --> 07:09.028
Disappearing for six days,

07:09.095 --> 07:11.564
{\an1}in and out of strip clubs,
got girls DM'ing me.

07:11.631 --> 07:14.200
{\an4}What you need to do
is tell your family
the real story,

07:14.267 --> 07:16.702
{\an1}and they need to apologize to me
for taking your side.

07:16.769 --> 07:18.771
I think it's hilarious
that the Norwoods want me

07:18.838 --> 07:21.841
to apologize to them when
they've never apologized to me

07:21.908 --> 07:24.310
for anything,
and they've attacked me

07:24.377 --> 07:26.412
for reacting to what Ray does.

07:26.479 --> 07:27.613
{\an1}This is what happens
when you do what you do.

07:27.680 --> 07:28.915
Listen.
I'm a new man.

07:28.981 --> 07:30.183
{\an3}No.

07:28.981 --> 07:30.183
There's consequences.

07:30.249 --> 07:32.585
You seriously
got me, like,

07:32.652 --> 07:35.555
{\an1}thinking about being
a single parent right now.

07:35.621 --> 07:39.559
{\an8}♪♪

07:42.328 --> 07:44.130
{\an8}(A1)
K. Michelle tried
to get under my skin

07:44.197 --> 07:45.765
{\an8}by taking shots at my wife.

07:45.832 --> 07:48.534
{\an8}So me and my wife had
to drag K. Michelle's fake ass

07:48.601 --> 07:51.270
{\an8}soon as she went to social media
with that bull(bleep).

07:51.337 --> 07:53.272
{\an8}<i>Just know that she</i>
<i>started it,</i>

07:53.339 --> 07:55.107
{\an8}<i>tweeting me</i>
<i>and my (bleep) first.</i>

07:55.174 --> 07:57.410
{\an8}<i>So (bleep)</i>
<i>her mother(bleep) ass.</i>

07:57.476 --> 07:59.512
So I'm putting all my energy
in the studio,

07:59.579 --> 08:01.848
and I asked my boy Marcus
to slide through

08:01.914 --> 08:03.049
so we could chop it up.

08:03.115 --> 08:04.317
What's up
with you, bro?

08:04.383 --> 08:05.885
Like, what's up
with you and Brooke?

08:05.952 --> 08:08.154
{\an1}I'm coolin' on all of the whole
love-triangle thing

08:08.221 --> 08:09.822
{\an1}with Kissy Valentine,
Lil Booby, and all that.

08:09.889 --> 08:11.357
(laughing)
Ohh!

08:11.424 --> 08:12.859
{\an1}I kind of, like,
moved on a little bit,

08:12.925 --> 08:14.160
{\an1}you know what
I'm sayin'?

08:14.227 --> 08:16.495
At the end of last year,
Brooke and I both agreed

08:16.562 --> 08:18.331
that we were not ready
for marriage.

08:18.397 --> 08:21.234
{\an8}And instead of waiting
a long, long, long, long time

08:21.300 --> 08:23.803
{\an8}for me to do it the right way,
Brooke took the ring from me.

08:23.870 --> 08:25.538
And you know she be calling me
to help her

08:25.605 --> 08:29.609
with every area of her life,
except the bedroom, of course.

08:29.675 --> 08:31.677
I mean, she told me go out there
and sow my royal oats.

08:31.744 --> 08:33.645
So, yeah, I've been entertaining
some options,

08:33.712 --> 08:37.316
and some of those options
are getting pretty serious.

08:37.383 --> 08:40.119
{\an4}I'm just trying
to keep it drama-free,
you know what I'm sayin'?

08:40.186 --> 08:41.787
{\an4}Unlike you,
you know what I'm sayin'?

08:40.186 --> 08:41.787
That's a good way, man.

08:41.854 --> 08:43.823
{\an1}You done turned
into Twitter Fingers on 'em.

08:43.890 --> 08:45.658
Nah, bruh,
come on.

08:45.725 --> 08:48.427
{\an1}Yo, what's goin' on
with all that?

08:48.494 --> 08:50.596
K. like,
"This some foul stuff."

08:50.663 --> 08:53.165
She thinkin' she in L.A.,
'bout to, you know,

08:53.232 --> 08:56.235
shut bitches down,
so I hit her.

08:56.302 --> 08:58.337
She's like,
"One thing I don't do,

08:58.404 --> 09:00.006
I don't tell no lies."

09:00.072 --> 09:01.574
{\an3}And...

09:00.072 --> 09:01.574
That's a lie.

09:01.641 --> 09:03.609
..."Lyrica was trying
to (bleep) Safaree."

09:03.676 --> 09:05.645
And I saw the texts.

09:05.711 --> 09:08.614
So I'm scratchin' head
like, "Damn."

09:08.681 --> 09:10.650
You know, like...

09:10.716 --> 09:13.152
Bro... that's crazy.

09:13.219 --> 09:16.989
{\an1}And this isn't the first time
that I've heard that.

09:17.056 --> 09:19.759
Brooke told me about the whole
Safaree and Lyrica thing,

09:19.825 --> 09:21.961
but, you know, I just
wrote it off as girl talk.

09:22.028 --> 09:24.697
But now, with the information
that A1 got from K.,

09:24.764 --> 09:26.565
I'm startin' to feel like
there's a little bit more to it.

09:26.632 --> 09:28.067
I'ma have to let my boy know.

09:28.134 --> 09:31.704
{\an1}So, so, Brooke came
and told me about it.

09:31.771 --> 09:33.572
{\an1}I think they might have been
shooting for Facebook Live

09:33.639 --> 09:35.141
{\an1}or something like that,
and she's like,

09:35.207 --> 09:37.143
"It got kind of weird,
you know?

09:37.209 --> 09:42.481
Lyrica and Safaree were
super, like, flirty."

09:42.548 --> 09:45.885
You're a Sag, right?
I'm not surprised.

09:45.952 --> 09:47.420
It's just like a Sag
to be ungrateful

09:47.486 --> 09:49.855
{\an5}when a man does something good
for his women.
Ooh!

09:49.922 --> 09:52.591
His last Sag got him
a little in pain.

09:52.658 --> 09:55.528
{\an1}She said that her phone
kept goin' off.

09:55.594 --> 09:57.363
{\an1}She texting back, and she look,
and it say "Safaree,"

09:57.430 --> 09:59.231
{\an1}and she laughing so hard,
and Brooke like,

09:59.298 --> 10:01.067
{\an1}"Yo, what are you doing
over there?"

10:01.133 --> 10:03.069
Safaree, you supposed
to be the homie.

10:03.135 --> 10:04.303
I'ma just go
holler at her.

10:04.370 --> 10:05.604
I don't even wanna
waste no time.

10:05.671 --> 10:07.940
And let's get back here
in a couple hours.

10:08.007 --> 10:09.008
{\an1}Yeah.

10:08.007 --> 10:09.008
Um, I'll be back.

10:09.075 --> 10:10.109
All right.

10:09.075 --> 10:10.109
{\an1}My dawg.

10:13.145 --> 10:15.247
{\an8}Princess has agreed
to make a public apology.

10:15.314 --> 10:17.950
{\an9}(chuckling)

10:15.314 --> 10:17.950
{\an8}That's really not funny.

10:18.017 --> 10:19.986
{\an8}And you was
my best friend!

10:20.052 --> 10:21.754
{\an8}I don't trust nobody!

10:21.821 --> 10:24.357
{\an8}That hurt me!

10:24.423 --> 10:26.125
{\an8}What's up with you
and Safaree?

10:26.192 --> 10:29.395

10:31.163 --> 10:33.199

10:33.265 --> 10:34.767

10:49.215 --> 10:53.319

that I could take,

10:53.386 --> 10:56.088
so I'm ready to kiki
with my good friend,

10:56.155 --> 10:58.924
Bridget Kelly, who's opening up
for me at my show,

10:58.991 --> 11:01.360
and just let her know
all the tea

11:01.427 --> 11:04.363
and how I've already started
to shake up L.A.

11:04.430 --> 11:06.632
{\an5}You always look pretty.

11:04.430 --> 11:06.632
{\an1}Thank you, babe.
So do you.

11:06.699 --> 11:09.168
{\an5}I have been doin' good.

11:06.699 --> 11:09.168
{\an1}I know.

11:09.235 --> 11:10.302
I have been calm.

11:10.369 --> 11:11.604
I haven't been
in anything for--

11:11.670 --> 11:13.639
well, kind of.

11:13.706 --> 11:16.142
Do you know that
orange-head-ass girl here?

11:16.208 --> 11:17.476
{\an1}You talking
about Lyrica?

11:17.543 --> 11:19.512
{\an1}I told her what they sayin'
in the industry.

11:19.578 --> 11:22.448
I told her the truth.
"You a spoiled brat."

11:22.515 --> 11:24.917
{\an5}And what did she say?

11:22.515 --> 11:24.917
{\an3}"You fake."

11:24.984 --> 11:28.287
{\an1}I said, "Well...
your marriage fake, bitch."

11:28.354 --> 11:30.122

11:28.354 --> 11:30.122

you was in New York,

11:33.426 --> 11:35.294
{\an8}you was tryin' to (bleep)
my friend Safaree."

11:35.361 --> 11:36.796
{\an1}What?!

11:36.862 --> 11:38.831
"Then you had your husband
come all over to my house."

11:38.898 --> 11:41.967
{\an1}Well, though, I mean...
yeah, it's a little crazy.

11:42.034 --> 11:44.170
I done had
a (bleep) Uber thief.

11:44.236 --> 11:46.205
I done had this
(bleep) fake-ass

11:46.272 --> 11:47.606
Malibu Barbie
come up in here.

11:47.673 --> 11:49.475
{\an1}Oh, God.

11:49.542 --> 11:51.210
(Bridget)
Lyrica and Safaree?

11:51.277 --> 11:53.145
Now, I know Brooke
mentioned to me

11:53.212 --> 11:55.681
that there might have been
a little flirtation going on,

11:55.748 --> 11:57.149
but, ma'am!

11:57.216 --> 12:00.386
And I thought that K.
was transformed into Kimberly.

12:00.453 --> 12:03.823
Hopefully Kimberly can put
all this fighting to the side

12:03.889 --> 12:06.692
and not treat Paris
the way she treats Lyrica,

12:06.759 --> 12:08.627
because I feel like
these two women have

12:08.694 --> 12:11.297
a true friendship
that needs to be reconciled.

12:11.363 --> 12:14.366
{\an1}Listen, I ran into Paris,
and I gave her your number.

12:14.433 --> 12:15.701
{\an1}I asked her to reach out
to you because--

12:15.768 --> 12:17.736
{\an5}She called me.

12:15.768 --> 12:17.736
She did call you?

12:17.803 --> 12:20.439
You know, I knew what
that was when I saw it.

12:20.506 --> 12:23.375
And I'm sure she didn't
tell you the whole story.

12:23.442 --> 12:24.510
I had gotten pregnant,

12:24.577 --> 12:26.679
so I had
a brand-new assistant.

12:26.745 --> 12:28.080
I sent her to the store

12:28.147 --> 12:29.715
to get some
ginger ale, crackers.

12:29.782 --> 12:31.984
{\an4}Yeah.

12:29.782 --> 12:31.984
And she come back,
"My card is declined."

12:32.051 --> 12:33.953
She like,
"You got fraud alert."

12:34.019 --> 12:35.821
I called Paris.

12:35.888 --> 12:38.958
I said, "Why are you
using my credit card

12:39.024 --> 12:41.427
"with my money
that I'm working for

12:41.494 --> 12:42.995

12:43.062 --> 12:46.098
{\an4}Yeah, she left all that out.
(clears throat)

12:43.062 --> 12:46.098
{\an3}Of course.

12:46.165 --> 12:48.033
Considering all of that,
that she didn't tell me,

12:48.100 --> 12:49.235
I know it took
a lot for her

12:49.301 --> 12:50.336
{\an1}to pick up the phone
and call you,

12:50.402 --> 12:51.937

a conversation.

12:52.004 --> 12:53.806
{\an5}After all these years--

12:52.004 --> 12:53.806
Why you want me
to talk to her?

12:53.873 --> 12:57.376

how badly it hurt you.

23:05.884 --> 23:06.852
It's a nice shirt.

23:06.918 --> 23:08.920
I thought of you
when I got it.

23:08.987 --> 23:10.589
Yeah! Jeez.

23:10.655 --> 23:13.592
Stas. What's up?

23:13.658 --> 23:15.494
{\an5}Who is this,
your assistant?

23:13.658 --> 23:15.494
Stas, yeah.

23:15.560 --> 23:18.296
{\an8}Definitely not
his assistant.

23:18.363 --> 23:19.431
Yeah, she not
my assistant.

23:19.498 --> 23:20.565
This your girlfriend?

23:20.632 --> 23:21.867
You got a girlfriend,
Marcus?

23:21.933 --> 23:23.468
{\an1}You know.

23:23.535 --> 23:24.736
When I talked to you
this morning,

23:24.803 --> 23:25.904
you didn't have
a girlfriend.

23:25.971 --> 23:27.706
So how long y'all
been together, 12 hours?

23:27.773 --> 23:28.707
We...

23:28.774 --> 23:30.075
{\an6}Marcus?

23:28.774 --> 23:30.075
{\an1}What?

23:30.142 --> 23:31.510
{\an5}Is this what
you doing?

23:30.142 --> 23:31.510
Here you go.

23:31.576 --> 23:33.111
You don't wanna hand me
that drink right now.

23:35.914 --> 23:38.116
(crowd chattering)

23:39.351 --> 23:41.319
{\an8}Are you happy
in your relationship?

23:41.386 --> 23:43.221
{\an8}I got a hot-ass date.

23:44.456 --> 23:46.191
{\an8}Lyrica was trying
to (bleep) Safaree.

23:46.258 --> 23:49.561
{\an7}I mean...
Safaree coming out here
for a K. Michelle show.

23:49.628 --> 23:51.062
{\an8}I need answers.

23:51.129 --> 23:53.098
{\an7}Right now, somebody's probably
under my comment,

23:53.165 --> 23:54.599
{\an8}calling me a thief.

23:54.666 --> 23:56.635
{\an8}You never know
who to trust, P.

24:03.141 --> 24:05.310
{\an8}♪♪

24:05.377 --> 24:07.179
{\an8}When I talked to you
this morning, you didn't
have a girlfriend.

24:07.245 --> 24:09.214
{\an8}So how long y'all been
together, 12 hours?

24:11.383 --> 24:14.119
{\an8}When Marcus and I decided
we weren't ready to get married,

24:14.186 --> 24:16.588
{\an8}I gave him a pass
to go sow his oats,

24:16.655 --> 24:19.658
but getting emotionally
attached to this girl

24:19.724 --> 24:21.359
and calling her
your girlfriend?

24:21.426 --> 24:25.063
No, no, baby, that wasn't
a part of the arrangement.

24:25.130 --> 24:28.633
{\an8}So when you spent
my birthday with me,
y'all was together.

24:28.700 --> 24:30.669
{\an5}For Thanksgiving, when
we spent that together.

24:28.700 --> 24:30.669
When's your birthday?

24:30.735 --> 24:33.572
For Christmas, when we were
together, you was with her.

24:33.638 --> 24:36.908
{\an5}For New Years
and for Valentine's Day,
y'all was together?

24:36.975 --> 24:39.044
Yeah. You really
spent those days with her?

24:39.110 --> 24:40.812
You wanna give me
the courtesy

24:40.879 --> 24:42.547
{\an5}to step to the side
and have a private
conversation?

24:42.614 --> 24:44.349
{\an4}We can--

24:42.614 --> 24:44.349
'Cause you know how
this could go, Marcus.

24:44.416 --> 24:46.918
{\an5}She don't deserve
the anger that I've
got right now.

24:46.985 --> 24:48.920
{\an5}We can step to the side.

24:46.985 --> 24:48.920
I don't even know her.

24:48.987 --> 24:51.823
{\an5}(Marcus)
Now, I know it may look like
I'm caught between two ladies,

24:51.890 --> 24:53.925
{\an8}but Brooke's the only one
that's confused here.

24:53.992 --> 24:55.327
{\an8}Last time I checked,

24:55.393 --> 24:56.928
{\an8}I was free to go do whatever
the hell I wanna do.

24:56.995 --> 24:58.964
{\an8}And if we ever get back
to the marriage conversation,

24:59.030 --> 25:00.198
then that'll be that.

25:00.265 --> 25:01.833
But it seem like she got
a different story

25:01.900 --> 25:03.034
about what's going on.

25:03.101 --> 25:04.636
If I recall correctly,

25:04.703 --> 25:07.105
{\an1}I believe you told me,
"Sow your royal oats

25:07.172 --> 25:08.173
and do you."

25:08.240 --> 25:09.241
So that's what I--

25:09.307 --> 25:10.575
that's what I went
on ahead and did.

25:10.642 --> 25:13.178
Marcus, I know I'm not
giving you no (bleep).

25:13.245 --> 25:15.780
{\an4}Uh-huh.

25:13.245 --> 25:15.780
So you "sowing
your royal oats"--

25:15.847 --> 25:16.882
{\an3}Okay, cool.

25:16.948 --> 25:18.183
But nobody told you
to go out

25:18.250 --> 25:19.451
and get you a girlfriend.

25:19.517 --> 25:21.486
That wasn't a part
of the deal, sir.

25:21.553 --> 25:24.456
I got a hot-ass date.

25:24.522 --> 25:26.391
You know what?
(clears throat)

25:26.458 --> 25:28.526
Are you happy
in your relationship?

25:28.593 --> 25:29.694
{\an5}Tell me that
you're happy...

25:28.593 --> 25:29.694
This is not a good time.

25:29.761 --> 25:31.129
...and you're
having a good time,

25:31.196 --> 25:32.797
so it can
make sense to me.

25:32.864 --> 25:34.599
{\an5}That's what I'm gonna--

25:32.864 --> 25:34.599
Don't touch my booty,
though, okay?

25:34.666 --> 25:37.435
{\an1}Are you really touching
her (bleep) ass?

25:37.502 --> 25:38.937
Are you serious?

25:39.004 --> 25:41.373
{\an4}Like, you're holding
onto me and--
like, really?

25:41.439 --> 25:42.507
(Marcus)
What are you doing?

25:42.574 --> 25:43.975
{\an5}No, what are you doing?

25:42.574 --> 25:43.975
Look, calm down.

25:44.042 --> 25:45.810
What do you mean, "Calm down"?
Do you see what you're doing?

25:45.877 --> 25:47.145
{\an5}Are you drunk?
Like, (bleep).

25:45.877 --> 25:47.145
Are you listening to her?

25:47.212 --> 25:48.480
(Brooke)
Look happy to me.

25:48.546 --> 25:50.015
{\an1}What do you mean,
am I listening to her?

25:50.081 --> 25:51.850
{\an1}Like, what--
what do you mean?

25:51.917 --> 25:53.718
Chill.
It's all good.

25:53.785 --> 25:54.786
{\an3}Marcus...

25:54.853 --> 25:56.254
Tell her if she play
her cards right,

25:56.321 --> 25:57.555
{\an5}she can get a ring
like this one you
got me.

25:57.622 --> 25:58.924
You stop!

25:58.990 --> 26:00.425
{\an1}What ring?

26:00.492 --> 26:03.328
Hold up! The ring that I didn't
give you Brooke, for real?

26:03.395 --> 26:05.664
Brooke stole that ring
from me at her mom's house.

26:05.730 --> 26:08.199
And I wasn't trippin' then,
but, (bleep), I'm trippin' now.

26:08.266 --> 26:09.868
I got a whole situation
over here.

26:09.935 --> 26:12.537
{\an5}So you got her a ring?

26:09.935 --> 26:12.537
No, no, no.

26:12.604 --> 26:13.872
{\an5}Yo, is this a joke now?

26:12.604 --> 26:13.872
{\an3}It's cute.

26:13.939 --> 26:15.140
{\an5}Listen...

26:13.939 --> 26:15.140
{\an3}I like it.

26:15.206 --> 26:16.141
I like it a lot.

26:30.855 --> 26:33.058

26:35.760 --> 26:38.997
{\an8}So I'm at my promo video
for my upcoming EP.

26:39.064 --> 26:40.465
And normally,
I would be excited.

26:40.532 --> 26:41.766
{\an3}All right.

26:41.833 --> 26:44.135
But this whole Lyrica situation
with Safaree,

26:44.202 --> 26:45.870
I'm just not feeling
the vibe.

26:45.937 --> 26:48.039
{\an5}Yeah?

26:45.937 --> 26:48.039
{\an3}Oh, cut.

26:50.075 --> 26:52.043
{\an8}I'm just not feeling
this (bleep), bro.

26:52.110 --> 26:54.479
{\an8}After running into Apple
at the bar with Lyrica,

26:54.546 --> 26:56.181
I invited her out
to my shoot,

26:56.247 --> 26:58.483
so she can get a real feel
for the industry.

26:58.550 --> 26:59.784
And I'm glad
she pulled up.

26:59.851 --> 27:01.519
It shows that she's hungry

27:01.586 --> 27:03.521
and serious about
this music game.

27:03.588 --> 27:04.789
So we gonna have y'all
set up right here.

some bars for me?

27:18.903 --> 27:19.871
No.

27:19.938 --> 27:21.873
{\an1}If Diddy walked in here
right now

27:21.940 --> 27:23.141

27:34.819 --> 27:36.521
With Princess
not at the house,

27:36.588 --> 27:38.390
I ain't got nobody
to hang out with.

27:38.456 --> 27:39.791
Hi. How you doin'?

27:39.858 --> 27:42.293
{\an6}Apple.

27:39.858 --> 27:42.293
Nice to meet you, Apple.

27:42.360 --> 27:43.762
And I seen you before.

27:43.828 --> 27:45.663
{\an5}Solo Lucci party.

27:43.828 --> 27:45.663
{\an3}Oh, yeah.

27:45.730 --> 27:48.099
{\an1}I missed the performance,
and the I seen it on Instagram.

27:48.166 --> 27:49.868
{\an5}Ready to start that.

27:48.166 --> 27:49.868
Why you leave early?

27:49.934 --> 27:51.369
{\an1}I'm trying to stay out
of the drama, man.

27:51.436 --> 27:54.039
{\an1}Listen, Princess
ain't at the house.

27:54.105 --> 27:57.308
{\an4}I'm all over the Internet now
with Princess putting out
subliminal (bleep),

27:57.375 --> 28:00.645
saying that I'm cheating,
and it's just a bad look.

28:00.712 --> 28:02.914
And I got this gender
party we about to do.

28:02.981 --> 28:04.916
{\an1}We about to reveal
what we having.

28:04.983 --> 28:07.452
{\an4}I need you there.
I need Lyrica there.

28:04.983 --> 28:07.452
(bleep).

28:07.519 --> 28:09.788
(A1)
If Lyrica gonna be there,

28:09.854 --> 28:11.689
then I ain't going...
I'm sorry.

28:11.756 --> 28:12.891
{\an1}What?

28:12.957 --> 28:14.192
If she gonna be there,
I'm not going.

28:14.259 --> 28:16.561
{\an1}What the (bleep)
you talking about?

28:16.628 --> 28:18.329
{\an5}I'ma, um...
Yeah, I gotcha.

28:16.628 --> 28:18.329
Yeah. Yeah.

28:18.396 --> 28:21.066
The way A1 rolled up on me
and Lyrica the other day,

28:21.132 --> 28:23.101
it gotta be some trouble
in paradise.

28:23.168 --> 28:24.702
But I just got cool with Lyrica,

28:24.769 --> 28:27.138
and I don't want no part
of they personal problems.

28:27.205 --> 28:29.407
I'm here that money
and that business.

28:29.474 --> 28:33.678
So... Lyrica gets into it
with K. Michelle, bro.

28:33.745 --> 28:37.582
I go holler at K. Michelle to,
you know, smooth things over.

28:37.649 --> 28:39.984
While I'm doing that,
K. Michelle tells me

28:40.051 --> 28:43.321
that Lyrica was trying
to (bleep) Safaree.

28:43.388 --> 28:45.990
Then I get Marcus
saying the same (bleep).

28:46.057 --> 28:49.094
{\an1}So at that point, I'm like,
"Yo, a'ight.

28:49.160 --> 28:51.096
It's coming from
multiple people."

28:51.162 --> 28:53.031
So-- so I-- you know.

28:53.098 --> 28:54.232
Two. No, I'm saying...

28:54.299 --> 28:55.400
(both)
Two is a lot.

28:55.467 --> 28:56.701
Two is too much.

28:56.768 --> 28:58.236
So I holler at Lyrica.

28:58.303 --> 29:00.405
She blows up and, like,
just getting--

29:00.472 --> 29:01.673
{\an5}Like she's guilty?

29:00.472 --> 29:01.673
Yeah!

29:01.739 --> 29:02.941
It was like
she was guilty.

29:03.007 --> 29:06.077
And I'm like,
"Okay. I need answers."

29:06.144 --> 29:09.347
{\an4}I mean, Safaree
coming out here for
K. Michelle's show.

29:09.414 --> 29:11.249
{\an1}I just don't think
that he would indulge

29:11.316 --> 29:13.618
{\an1}in your situation
like that.

29:13.685 --> 29:14.986

We took sperm tests
together and everything!

29:18.690 --> 29:22.594
Now, I know Safaree wouldn't do
the whole clique like that, man.

29:22.660 --> 29:23.962
He-- He our brother,

give me the real.

30:05.336 --> 30:07.539
(Kimberly)
Paris was like a sister to me,

30:07.605 --> 30:09.607
but for the past three,
four years,

30:09.674 --> 30:12.510
I removed her from my life
for using my credit card.

30:12.577 --> 30:14.245
It wasn't about
the amount of money,

30:14.312 --> 30:15.613
it was about the principle.

30:15.680 --> 30:17.882
I feel like I could have
handled it better,

30:17.949 --> 30:20.118
{\an5}but I don't think
you understand how
that hurt me.

30:20.185 --> 30:22.253
{\an1}It was a Uber,
the Uber was $50.

30:22.320 --> 30:25.356
{\an1}And I didn't look at it as
being malicious and stealing.

30:25.423 --> 30:27.192
{\an5}Well, you didn't--

30:25.423 --> 30:27.192
So, when you put out there

30:27.258 --> 30:28.526
"she stole my credit card,"

30:28.593 --> 30:30.862
{\an1}right now somebody's
probably under my comment

30:30.929 --> 30:32.363
calling me a thief.

30:32.430 --> 30:33.898
How do I go apply for a job

30:33.965 --> 30:35.867
with people thinking
that I'm a thief?

30:35.934 --> 30:38.203
It's like you really tried
to ruin my whole world,

30:38.269 --> 30:39.871
my lifestyle, everything.

30:39.938 --> 30:41.940
You never know
who to trust, P.

30:42.006 --> 30:44.742
{\an4}Right. That's how I am
now though, K.

30:42.006 --> 30:44.742
You was the closest to me.

30:44.809 --> 30:46.544
{\an4}From this situation
with me...

30:44.809 --> 30:46.544
You was my...

30:46.611 --> 30:49.614
{\an5}(sobbing)
you was my... Paris,
you was my best friend,

30:49.681 --> 30:51.482
and you was my sister
and my family.

30:51.549 --> 30:53.952
I don't trust nobody.

30:54.018 --> 30:55.520
That hurt me.

30:55.587 --> 30:59.724
Imagine being in a house,
nobody there.

30:59.791 --> 31:03.161
And the one (bleep)
you working you hard for,

31:03.228 --> 31:05.997
your money, ain't even
good for you.

31:06.064 --> 31:08.199
{\an5}(Paris)
K. Michelle always
plays the victim.

31:08.266 --> 31:09.500
I'm the victim!

31:09.567 --> 31:12.070
You used your platform
to call me a thief,

31:12.136 --> 31:14.105
and it still
haunts me to today.

31:14.172 --> 31:17.508
{\an1}I always thought
you'd be my friend forever.

31:17.575 --> 31:18.876
But you was wrong.

31:18.943 --> 31:21.312
{\an1}See, but you don't think
you owe me an apology.

31:21.379 --> 31:23.481
I think I owe you an apology

31:23.548 --> 31:24.849
because I wasn't trying
to ruin your life,

31:24.916 --> 31:26.317
I've only wanted
the best for you.

31:26.384 --> 31:29.187
{\an1}Well, I do accept
the apology,

31:29.254 --> 31:30.488
and I should--

31:29.254 --> 31:30.488
{\an3}No! No, no.

31:30.555 --> 31:32.223
(bleep), I take it.

31:32.290 --> 31:34.259
{\an5}I accept the apology.

31:32.290 --> 31:34.259
{\an3}Only you.

31:34.325 --> 31:37.295
{\an1}If I'm saying that I didn't
mean to destroy,

31:37.362 --> 31:38.930
you can be honest
and say...

31:38.997 --> 31:40.598
{\an1}I shouldn't have hit
the button.

31:43.401 --> 31:45.436
I feel like ending
the beef with Paris

31:45.503 --> 31:48.206
is just another form
of healing.

31:48.273 --> 31:50.174
I need to be healed all over.

31:50.241 --> 31:52.543
Come wash me down, Jesus,
wipe me down.

31:52.610 --> 31:54.245
Did you miss me
a little bit?

31:54.312 --> 31:56.214
Eh, sometimes.

31:54.312 --> 31:56.214
{\an3}(laughs)

32:00.485 --> 32:01.486
{\an8}(woman)
Coming up...

32:01.552 --> 32:02.654
{\an8}(Princess)
This is your son.

32:02.720 --> 32:04.155
{\an8}That's right.

32:02.720 --> 32:04.155
{\an8}And I have my mother.

32:04.222 --> 32:05.423
{\an8}And don't you ever
forget that, okay?

32:05.490 --> 32:06.824
{\an8}And don't <i> you</i> ever
forget that.

32:06.891 --> 32:08.059
{\an8}Don't you ever forget it.

32:06.891 --> 32:08.059
{\an8}Don't you ever forget it.

32:08.126 --> 32:09.160
{\an8}Okay, I'm done.

32:15.233 --> 32:17.101
{\an8}♪♪

32:18.469 --> 32:20.405
{\an8}(applause)

32:22.273 --> 32:23.975
{\an8}(Ray J)
I gotta hand it to Princess.

32:24.042 --> 32:25.476
{\an8}I mean, even though
I've been gone,

32:25.543 --> 32:28.246
{\an8}she basically planned this
gender reveal party

32:28.313 --> 32:29.681
{\an8}by herself.

32:29.747 --> 32:32.917
Plus a baby shower coming up,
and other family stuff,

32:32.984 --> 32:34.485
and it looks good!

32:34.552 --> 32:37.221
{\an5}(Princess)
This has been a long time
in the making,

32:37.288 --> 32:39.457
and I'm so glad that our friends
and family could be here

32:39.524 --> 32:41.025
to share this moment with us.

32:41.092 --> 32:42.393
{\an1}(Ray J)
Hey, I wanna thank everybody

32:42.460 --> 32:43.895
for coming to this event.

32:43.961 --> 32:47.465
I mean, this is the most
important event of all time.

32:47.532 --> 32:48.666
(cheers and applause)

32:48.733 --> 32:50.101
(Princess)
What I'm not excited about

32:50.168 --> 32:51.836
is seeing Ray's family here,

32:51.903 --> 32:53.805
{\an8}especially after all
of the things

32:53.871 --> 32:55.540
{\an8}that they've done
these past couple weeks

32:55.606 --> 32:57.642
{\an8}with the social media
and the text messages.

32:57.709 --> 33:00.712
Princess, you've been doing such
a good job carrying the baby.

33:00.778 --> 33:02.413
I mean, all the way through.

33:02.480 --> 33:03.981
And before we get into

33:04.048 --> 33:06.684
{\an1}the-- the special
festivities,

33:06.751 --> 33:09.087
{\an4}Princess, you wanna say
something to the crowd
real quick?

33:09.153 --> 33:12.457
Yes, I'd like to thank
my friends and family

33:12.523 --> 33:14.826
who came today
all the way from Texas.

33:14.892 --> 33:16.728
{\an6}Thank you.

33:14.892 --> 33:16.728
(cheers and applause)

33:16.794 --> 33:19.297
There-- there anything else?

33:20.998 --> 33:23.501
If Ray is waiting
for a public apology,

33:23.568 --> 33:25.002
that's not gonna happen.

33:25.069 --> 33:27.071
He should be happy
that I even let him come

33:27.138 --> 33:29.374
and pretend like we're some
big, happy family.

33:29.440 --> 33:30.808
{\an1}(Ray J)
All right, here we go.

33:30.875 --> 33:33.010
Five, four...

33:33.077 --> 33:36.013
(all)
Three, two, one!

33:37.548 --> 33:39.417
(cheers and applause)

33:39.484 --> 33:43.287
It's a girl!
(laughing)

33:43.354 --> 33:44.822
I wanted a little Princess,

33:44.889 --> 33:47.158
and Princess wanted
a little Ray J.

33:47.225 --> 33:50.328
But we are happy to welcome
this beautiful new human being

33:50.395 --> 33:51.896
into our family.

33:51.963 --> 33:54.899
Everything is going great.
I just hope it stays this way.

33:54.966 --> 33:56.534
{\an1}Hey, Mama.

33:57.602 --> 33:59.103
{\an7}Hey, Ray.

33:59.170 --> 34:02.940
{\an8}It's a girl, you know,
so it's a beautiful thing,

34:03.007 --> 34:03.975
and it's a beautiful moment.

34:04.041 --> 34:05.376
This is the time for us

34:05.443 --> 34:08.246
to be into a, you know,
a united front.

34:08.312 --> 34:11.748
Even Princess has agreed to--
to make a public apology

34:11.815 --> 34:13.951
{\an5}with everything
that's been going on.

34:11.815 --> 34:13.951
{\an3}I have?

34:14.018 --> 34:15.953
Public apology.
Princess?

34:18.922 --> 34:20.391
That's really not funny.

34:20.458 --> 34:23.094
{\an4}She publicly
embarrassed you--

34:20.458 --> 34:23.094
{\an3}How? How?

34:23.161 --> 34:25.062
{\an6}How? How?

34:23.161 --> 34:25.062
{\an1}You put him out
there in the public

34:25.129 --> 34:26.964
{\an5}on some BS.

34:25.129 --> 34:26.964
You take into consideration

34:27.031 --> 34:28.266
what you've done?

34:28.331 --> 34:30.168
Why don't you tell him
to apologize to me?

34:30.234 --> 34:31.936
{\an1}Hey, hold up, I don't wanna
get you upset,

34:32.003 --> 34:33.371
because I lost a baby once.

34:33.438 --> 34:35.106
{\an1}I want you to stay
stress-free,

34:35.172 --> 34:36.574
and I'll deal with you
after the baby is born.

34:36.641 --> 34:37.574
We'll never deal with it,
'cause I don't care

34:37.641 --> 34:39.143
about dealing with it.

34:39.210 --> 34:40.710
{\an5}Okay, I don't care
either, Princess.

34:39.210 --> 34:40.710
This is not the place.

34:40.777 --> 34:41.846
Okay, this is your son.

34:41.913 --> 34:43.114
{\an5}That's right.

34:41.913 --> 34:43.114
And I have my mother.

34:43.181 --> 34:44.415
And don't you ever
forget that, okay?

34:44.482 --> 34:45.882
And don't <i> you</i> ever
forget that.

34:45.949 --> 34:48.286
{\an5}Don't you ever
forget it.

34:45.949 --> 34:48.286
Stop, this is not--

34:48.351 --> 34:49.754
We have to respect,
we have to respect.

34:49.821 --> 34:51.489
{\an5}'Cause she wasn't--

34:49.821 --> 34:51.489
Stop, y'all gotta...

34:51.556 --> 34:54.058
{\an5}She wasn't raised like that.

34:51.556 --> 34:54.058
Stop, stop.

34:54.125 --> 34:56.994
And you were?

34:57.061 --> 34:58.329
Where's my apology?

34:58.396 --> 35:00.198
Ray's family can't even
admit for one second

35:00.264 --> 35:01.466
the stuff that he did,

35:01.532 --> 35:03.634
but want me to apologize
for a meme that I posted

35:03.701 --> 35:05.436
just because it made him
look bad.

35:06.637 --> 35:07.738
{\an5}I don't care.

35:06.637 --> 35:07.738
...that you were okay.

35:07.805 --> 35:10.208
I don't care.
I'm done.

35:10.274 --> 35:11.876
You guys can see the baby
when she gets here,

35:11.943 --> 35:13.911
{\an5}but me, I'm done.

35:11.943 --> 35:13.911
Done with what?

35:13.978 --> 35:15.413
{\an3}Everything.

35:15.480 --> 35:17.081
{\an7}I don't have anything
but love here.

35:17.148 --> 35:19.383
{\an7}I just don't want
everybody in our business

35:19.450 --> 35:20.585
{\an8}as a family.

35:20.651 --> 35:22.053
{\an7}You took
your name down.

35:22.119 --> 35:23.721
{\an1}Like...

35:22.119 --> 35:23.721
{\an3}So what?

35:23.788 --> 35:25.823
{\an1}But you've got to be
an example for that baby.

35:25.890 --> 35:27.825
She'll be fine.
She'll be fine.

35:27.892 --> 35:29.560
And you're an example
for your baby?

35:29.627 --> 35:31.329
{\an4}I am. I'm trying to be
every day.

35:29.627 --> 35:31.329
{\an3}Okay.

35:31.395 --> 35:32.964
Okay, 'cause I see you
on stage--

35:33.030 --> 35:34.765
on stage with
a typing bag all the time.

35:34.832 --> 35:36.100
{\an5}I'm not perfect.

35:34.832 --> 35:36.100
Okay, and neither am I.

35:36.167 --> 35:38.035
{\an4}And I'm not
a punk.

35:36.167 --> 35:38.035
And neither am I.

35:38.102 --> 35:39.604
Stop. Stop.

35:39.670 --> 35:41.205
This went
all the way left.

35:41.272 --> 35:42.840
Granted, I might be
a part of the reason

35:42.907 --> 35:44.075
everybody is beefing,

35:44.141 --> 35:46.611
but we all
gotta get past this.

35:46.677 --> 35:48.980
{\an5}We're welcoming
this beautiful baby
into the world,

35:49.046 --> 35:51.249
and all this stuff
should be straight.

35:51.315 --> 35:52.750
{\an1}We just don't want
Ray embarrassed

35:52.817 --> 35:54.318
{\an1}or you embarrassed
or this family embarrassed,

35:54.385 --> 35:56.187
{\an1}because of a moment
in time

35:56.254 --> 35:58.689
that we didn't protect.

35:58.756 --> 35:59.991
{\an4}(Ray J)
Shouldn't be
talking about this.

36:00.057 --> 36:02.226
{\an4}(Brandy)
And you just wanna fight
for no reason.

36:02.293 --> 36:04.562
I'm not gonna take
marriage advice from

36:04.629 --> 36:06.230
someone that can't even
stay in a relationship

36:06.297 --> 36:07.899
for longer than
three months.

36:09.300 --> 36:10.635
You guys deserve a shot

36:10.701 --> 36:12.203
{\an1}at being good parents
to this baby,

36:12.270 --> 36:13.804
{\an1}and--

36:12.270 --> 36:13.804
We will be good parents.

36:13.871 --> 36:15.373
Yeah, but it
won't happen

36:15.439 --> 36:17.975
{\an5}if everybody is...

36:15.439 --> 36:17.975
We're in the spotlight.

36:18.042 --> 36:20.077
People are gonna be in
our business regardless.

36:20.144 --> 36:21.746
{\an1}But you don't
have to add to it.

36:21.812 --> 36:24.615
{\an1}I mean it.

36:24.682 --> 36:26.050
It wasn't supposed to
be like that.

36:26.117 --> 36:28.452
I love you, okay?

36:28.519 --> 36:29.820
Brandy is so full of it.

36:29.887 --> 36:31.155
She's always
trying to act like

36:31.222 --> 36:32.790
Sister-in-law of the Year,

36:32.857 --> 36:34.258
but behind closed doors

36:34.325 --> 36:36.127
sends me threatening
text messages.

36:36.193 --> 36:38.496
Until Ray's family stops
seeing me as a villain,

36:38.563 --> 36:39.730
I don't need to
see them anymore.

36:39.797 --> 36:41.065
Because they're the problem.

36:41.132 --> 36:42.800
{\an1}I'm not gonna filter
my life

36:42.867 --> 36:44.101
and filter what I do

36:44.168 --> 36:45.369
{\an1}because people
are watching me.

36:48.539 --> 36:50.575
{\an1}Because all they care about
is the image.

36:50.641 --> 36:53.444
{\an1}And I-- I really
don't give a (bleep).

36:53.511 --> 36:54.478
{\an8}(woman)
Coming up...

36:54.545 --> 36:55.513
{\an8}You (bleep) him,
didn't you?

36:55.580 --> 36:57.682
{\an8}Lying, fake-ass bitch!

36:57.748 --> 36:59.550
{\an7}(bleep) you doing,
texting my wife, bro?

36:59.617 --> 37:00.918
{\an8}It is what it is.

37:00.985 --> 37:02.053
{\an8}Why you taking--

37:00.985 --> 37:02.053
{\an7}What you mean,
"It is what it is"?

37:02.119 --> 37:03.154
{\an8}Why you taking
a bunch of (bleep)

37:03.221 --> 37:03.854
{\an8}out your pocket like
you came out here

37:03.921 --> 37:04.889
{\an8}to do something?

37:11.262 --> 37:15.633
{\an8}♪♪

37:15.700 --> 37:17.635
{\an8}(indistinct chatter)

37:20.705 --> 37:23.608
Yo, Brooke.

37:23.674 --> 37:24.709
My marriage is falling apart

37:24.775 --> 37:26.077
all because someone

37:26.143 --> 37:27.511
that I thought was my friend

37:27.578 --> 37:28.813
is spreading lies
about me.

37:28.879 --> 37:31.082
I'm so tired of
these fake, delusional,

37:31.148 --> 37:32.750
wanna-be-married-ass girls

37:32.817 --> 37:34.418
coming for my real marriage

37:34.485 --> 37:37.154
because they're unhappy
in what they don't have.

37:37.221 --> 37:39.523
{\an1}You going around telling
whoever will listen

37:39.590 --> 37:41.092
that I (bleep) Safaree,

37:41.158 --> 37:42.126
{\an1}or that me and Safaree
were sexting.

37:42.193 --> 37:43.127
{\an1}Like, why would you
go repeat

37:43.194 --> 37:44.562
{\an1}some (bleep)
that ain't real?

37:44.629 --> 37:45.630
{\an4}That's all
I need to know.

37:44.629 --> 37:45.630
What exactly
wasn't real?

37:45.696 --> 37:46.864
Lyrica definitely knows

37:46.931 --> 37:48.666
how to make
an entrance,

37:48.733 --> 37:50.301
but it's not like I lie.

37:50.368 --> 37:52.603
So Lyrica
better own it.

37:52.670 --> 37:54.672
This whole thing
started because

37:54.739 --> 37:56.540
you not getting no (bleep)
in your marriage...

37:56.607 --> 37:58.609
{\an4}First of all,
I'm always getting (bleep)
in my marriage.

37:58.676 --> 38:01.278
No, you know A1 ain't
dropping (bleep) off.

38:01.345 --> 38:03.014
And you was
a little horny

38:03.080 --> 38:04.281
and Safaree was
flirting with you.

38:04.348 --> 38:05.449
He was talking about
your booty.

38:05.516 --> 38:06.450
(indistinct)

38:06.517 --> 38:07.885
Safaree flirts
with everybody.

38:07.952 --> 38:08.886
{\an1}He was flirting with
you, too.

38:08.953 --> 38:09.887
{\an1}That ain't got
(bleep) to do with

38:09.954 --> 38:10.955
what's going on.

38:11.022 --> 38:12.223
{\an1}Why would you go
repeat some (bleep)

38:12.289 --> 38:13.457
that ain't real?

38:13.524 --> 38:15.559
Saying that it's
coming out of nowhere

38:15.626 --> 38:16.560
and it's just a rumor

38:16.627 --> 38:17.895
is not the truth, Lyrica.

38:17.962 --> 38:18.896
Keep it
all the way real.

38:18.963 --> 38:20.097
{\an1}Okay, so show me
some receipts.

38:20.164 --> 38:21.899
{\an1}Where's the (bleep)
text message?

38:21.966 --> 38:23.234
Show me the receipts.

38:23.300 --> 38:24.502
Where are they?

38:24.568 --> 38:25.836
Yeah, where is
the text messages, Lyrica?

38:25.903 --> 38:26.904
Where are they?!

38:26.971 --> 38:27.905
You (bleep) him,
didn't you?

38:29.106 --> 38:30.307
You (bleep) him
and you liked it.

38:30.374 --> 38:32.009
Shut the (bleep) up!

38:32.076 --> 38:33.711
(crosstalk)

38:33.778 --> 38:35.913
(bleep) lying,
fake-ass bitch!

38:35.980 --> 38:37.048
{\an1}That's what
it's (bleep) about.

38:37.114 --> 38:39.417
{\an4}You being
a fake-ass bitch.

38:37.114 --> 38:39.417
She mad.

38:39.483 --> 38:41.085
{\an5}(bleep) you, bitch.

38:39.483 --> 38:41.085
Why you that mad

38:41.152 --> 38:42.553
{\an5}if it's not true?

38:41.152 --> 38:42.553
{\an1}Because you fake
as (bleep).

38:42.620 --> 38:44.088
{\an1}You ain't never been
my mother(bleep) friend.

38:44.155 --> 38:45.589
{\an1}You ain't no different
than these other

38:45.656 --> 38:47.091
{\an5}Hollywood bitches.

38:45.656 --> 38:47.091
Y'all was definitely
texting each other.

38:47.158 --> 38:48.926
Go hang out with
(bleep) Kimberly,

38:48.993 --> 38:50.327
{\an1}because you just like
that ho.

38:50.394 --> 38:52.997
{\an5}That's how you feel?

38:50.394 --> 38:52.997
{\an1}Yeah, that's how I

39:07.078 --> 39:09.013
The way Lyrica reacted to
the Safaree rumors,

39:09.080 --> 39:11.649
makes me feel like
she got something to hide.

39:11.716 --> 39:13.751
If Lyrica's not gonna
own up to it,

39:13.818 --> 39:14.885
it's only
one way to find out.

39:14.952 --> 39:17.755
{\an8}Safaree's in town
for K.'s show,

39:17.822 --> 39:19.290

to see what's good.

40:29.660 --> 40:33.297
{\an8}I had a lot of large mass
in my breast.

40:33.364 --> 40:34.565
{\an8}Like, like--
Like lumps?
