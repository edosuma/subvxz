Real Estate Query Engine
is a virtual Rubicon of information

01:05.315 --> 01:07.816
putting the lawyer himself
at the controls...

01:07.901 --> 01:12.029
I'm gonna take off, okay?
I'll try and catch the 2:00 back.

01:12.113 --> 01:14.490
You're leaving the seminar now?
It's not even intermission.

01:14.574 --> 01:17.910
- I don't think you can do that.
- It's fine. Cover for me.

01:17.994 --> 01:20.412
- Get it all.
- I guess.

01:20.497 --> 01:23.290
- Could we have your badge?
- Yeah.

01:23.374 --> 01:26.251
It's worth two free drinks
at the Meet and Greet.

01:41.476 --> 01:42.476
Hello.

01:42.560 --> 01:46.021
I'm going to the airport.
I'm kind of in a hurry, too.

01:47.315 --> 01:49.274
Sorry, your seat belt seems
to be broken.

01:49.359 --> 01:51.193
What do you recommend I do?

01:51.653 --> 01:54.404
I recommend
you stop being such a faggot.

01:55.156 --> 01:57.032
You're in the back seat.

01:57.408 --> 01:58.867
Jesus.

02:01.663 --> 02:02.871
See?

03:29.667 --> 03:34.213
Hello?

03:35.298 --> 03:36.632
Hey, boy.

03:36.966 --> 03:39.635
Good boy, Orson. Where's Mommy?

03:42.305 --> 03:43.555
Honey?

03:46.059 --> 04:00.530
Heidi?

04:14.003 --> 04:15.170
Mitch!

04:16.339 --> 04:19.507
What are you doing home?
You totally scared me!

04:20.093 --> 04:23.845
I scared you?
Because for a second, I thought...

04:24.597 --> 04:26.515
I don't even want to say it.

04:30.353 --> 04:31.603
Wow!

04:31.688 --> 04:34.648
That's, like, pretty hard-core.

04:34.732 --> 04:36.441
Yeah, I know.

04:36.526 --> 04:39.945
No, I'm not judging.
Don't be embarrassed.

04:40.029 --> 04:42.948
This is a major turn-on.
Let's go with this.

04:43.700 --> 04:45.993
- Is this what you do when I'm gone?
- Wait.

04:46.077 --> 04:49.371
I do it myself every once in a while,
but to magazines.

04:49.455 --> 04:52.457
- Mitch, we need to talk.
- Hello!

04:57.714 --> 04:59.298
Be honest.

04:59.382 --> 05:02.509
Please tell me this is the first time
this has happened.

05:03.386 --> 05:04.803
You want me to be honest,

05:04.887 --> 05:07.097
or you want me to tell you
this is the first time?

05:07.181 --> 05:11.476
- What is wrong with you?
- Nothing is wrong with me!

05:11.561 --> 05:13.353
I've tried to tell you about this.

05:13.438 --> 05:15.564
What? When?

05:16.399 --> 05:18.734
- All the time!
- Like when?

05:19.736 --> 05:23.113
- Like, when we're in bed and stuff.
- In bed?

05:24.240 --> 05:26.491
I thought you were just talking dirty.

05:26.576 --> 05:29.703
I was, but I was being serious.

05:33.583 --> 05:36.001
You've said some really sick stuff.

05:36.085 --> 05:37.419
You have to admit,

05:37.503 --> 05:41.006
we haven't been living
the most exciting lives in the world.

05:41.090 --> 05:44.593
This is a totally different
kind of satisfaction for me.

05:44.677 --> 05:46.178
It's purely sexual.

05:50.516 --> 05:52.642
I'm really sorry.

06:04.113 --> 06:06.573
- Hello.
- Yeah?

06:07.200 --> 06:08.992
I'm here for the gang bang.

06:14.749 --> 06:16.833
You look a little pale, Mitch.
You need to breathe.

06:16.918 --> 06:19.127
Let a little blood up in your face.

06:19.212 --> 06:22.089
- I don't want to breathe.
- You should be proud of yourself.

06:22.173 --> 06:26.051
Do you know how hard it is to land a girl
as sexually enlightened as Heidi?

06:26.135 --> 06:28.887
A girl like that comes around
once every hundred years.

06:28.971 --> 06:31.223
I wasn't looking for a girl like that.

06:31.307 --> 06:33.141
Columbus wasn't looking for America,

06:33.226 --> 06:35.227
but that seemed to work out
for everybody.

06:35.311 --> 06:37.312
You're here. You know what I mean?

06:37.397 --> 06:40.690
I just want to thank you
one last time for being here.

06:40.775 --> 06:42.734
It's the best day ever.

06:42.819 --> 06:46.488
Don't even start with me, Franklin.
You need to walk away from this ASAP.

06:46.572 --> 06:49.408
- What?
- You need to get out, Frankie.

06:56.082 --> 06:58.083
It's now or never.

06:58.167 --> 06:59.918
Get out of here while you're still single.

07:00.002 --> 07:03.880
- I'm not single.
- You're still single right now.

07:03.965 --> 07:07.634
This is the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

07:07.718 --> 07:10.178
Give that six months. That will change.

07:10.263 --> 07:12.597
I got a wife, kids.

07:12.682 --> 07:15.475
Do I seem like a happy guy to you,
Frankie?

07:16.060 --> 07:18.103
There's my wife. See that?

07:18.187 --> 07:21.523
Always smiling? Hi, honey.
Judging, watching. "Look at the baby."

07:21.607 --> 07:24.359
She's coming down the aisle, Beanie.
Let it go.

07:27.071 --> 07:30.115
Let me be the first to say
congratulations to you, then.

07:30.199 --> 07:31.741
You get one vagina
for the rest of your life.

07:31.826 --> 07:33.910
Real smart. Way to work it through.

07:33.995 --> 07:36.538
- Don't listen to him, Frank.
- I need my inhaler.

07:36.622 --> 07:37.622
Thank you, Daddy.

07:39.208 --> 07:42.169
It takes a man to give away an angel.
You're a sweetheart.

07:42.253 --> 07:44.129
You look beautiful.

07:44.213 --> 07:45.380
Great.

07:48.968 --> 07:50.469
Dearly beloved,

07:50.553 --> 07:55.265
we are gathered here together
to join Franklin and Marissa...

07:55.349 --> 07:56.808
Don't do it!

08:01.439 --> 08:04.149
My throat is dry. I'm sorry.
I'm a smoker.

08:04.984 --> 08:06.109
Okay.

08:06.194 --> 08:07.694
Turn around

08:07.778 --> 08:10.822
Every now and then
I get a little bit lonely

08:10.907 --> 08:12.949
And you're never coming round

08:13.034 --> 08:14.618
Turn around

08:14.702 --> 08:17.871
Every now and then
I get a little bit tired

08:17.955 --> 08:19.998
Of listening to the sound of my tears

08:20.082 --> 08:21.833
Turn around

08:21.918 --> 08:25.045
Every now and then
I get a little bit nervous

08:25.129 --> 08:27.214
That the best of all the years
have gone by

08:27.298 --> 08:28.924
Turn around

08:29.008 --> 08:32.135
Every now and then
I get a little bit terrified

08:32.220 --> 08:34.554
But then I see the fucking look
in your eyes

08:34.639 --> 08:35.931
Turn around

08:36.015 --> 08:37.765
Bright eyes

08:37.850 --> 08:39.683
Every now and then I fall apart

08:39.769 --> 08:41.311
Turn around

08:41.395 --> 08:42.604
Bright eyes

08:42.688 --> 08:46.107
Well, fucking every now and then
I fall apart

08:46.192 --> 08:49.444
And I need you now tonight

08:49.529 --> 08:52.364
I fucking need you more than ever

08:52.448 --> 08:54.366
...the look in your eye

08:54.909 --> 08:59.204
And now I find now
I need you more than...

08:59.288 --> 09:00.705
Mitch Martin?

09:00.790 --> 09:01.957
Yeah.

09:06.087 --> 09:07.337
Nicole!

09:08.297 --> 09:10.006
My God!

09:10.258 --> 09:12.592
This is crazy!

09:12.677 --> 09:14.636
I can't believe it's you!

09:14.720 --> 09:16.221
Oh!

09:16.305 --> 09:18.473
Oh, God!

09:19.684 --> 09:22.394
- What are you doing here?
- I was invited.

09:22.478 --> 09:29.067
Yeah, the last time that I had heard,
you had moved to...

09:29.151 --> 09:31.444
- What do you call it?
- Denver.

09:31.946 --> 09:34.906
The Sunshine State. Denver.

09:34.991 --> 09:37.325
Gorgeous! Gorgeous!

09:40.288 --> 09:41.830
Oh, boy.

09:42.415 --> 09:45.375
- Are you okay?
- No, I'm...

09:45.459 --> 09:48.336
Yeah, I just I feel a little...

09:49.755 --> 09:51.006
Fucked up.

09:51.382 --> 09:54.843
Marissa told me about your girlfriend.
I'm very sorry.

09:57.346 --> 10:01.016
The thing about that one is,
is it's not just that.

10:01.726 --> 10:04.436
It's a combination of things.

10:04.520 --> 10:09.357
We had a dog, we had a great place,
but all just...

10:09.692 --> 10:11.443
Just...

10:11.527 --> 10:14.654
You know what?
I think you should have some of this.

10:14.739 --> 10:17.073
- What's in this one?
- Coffee.

10:23.414 --> 10:24.873
Jesus!

10:25.708 --> 10:28.752
I am so sorry! Please, just...

10:28.836 --> 10:31.421
I can fix it. Just...

10:31.505 --> 10:34.799
- No, Mitch!
- What are you doing to this poor girl?

10:34.884 --> 10:37.260
Mitch, stop it! I got it.

10:37.345 --> 10:39.971
No. Inappropriate. Stop it right now.

10:40.056 --> 10:41.931
There's a bathroom over here.

10:42.016 --> 10:44.726
Mitch, honey? Hon?

10:44.810 --> 10:48.605
- Go get some air. Walk it off.
- Wait a second.

10:48.689 --> 10:50.190
Yeah?

10:50.274 --> 10:53.234
- Put in a good word for me.
- Okay.

10:58.240 --> 11:00.700
It's fucking

11:00.785 --> 11:03.870
Real loving

11:03.954 --> 11:05.538
You're my

11:06.582 --> 11:08.958
lady

11:09.502 --> 11:11.294
Hey, Marissa!

11:11.379 --> 11:12.921
You're the lady.

11:25.434 --> 11:26.851
I'd like to say I'm...

11:26.936 --> 11:29.562
- Can't hear you!
...glad and...

11:29.647 --> 11:30.772
Excuse me.

11:30.856 --> 11:34.859
I'd like to say I'm really glad
and proud to be here tonight.

11:36.445 --> 11:40.365
I'm glad to see Frank's dad made it out.
I haven't seen him in eight years.

11:40.449 --> 11:42.200
That's great. Congratulations.

11:42.284 --> 11:44.411
I love you, Dad!

11:44.495 --> 11:47.163
True love is hard to find.

11:47.248 --> 11:48.873
Sometimes you think
you have true love,

11:48.958 --> 11:52.669
then you catch the early flight home
from San Diego

11:52.753 --> 11:56.047
and a couple of nude people jump out
of your bathroom blindfolded

11:56.132 --> 11:59.926
like a goddamn magic show,
ready to double-team your girlfriend...

12:00.010 --> 12:04.013
It stops right there
and it continues right here,

12:04.098 --> 12:08.184
because what Mitch is trying to say
is that true love is blind.

12:09.353 --> 12:11.563
Let's raise our glasses.

12:11.647 --> 12:13.523
Salute. Health and happiness.

12:14.442 --> 12:15.817
Cheers, everybody.

12:16.527 --> 12:19.237
I love you so much, Frankie. I love you.

12:19.321 --> 12:21.114
I'm not a talker.

12:21.198 --> 12:23.366
I love you. Congratulations.

12:44.388 --> 12:47.932
I thought you said near campus.
This is practically on-campus. It's sick.

12:48.017 --> 12:50.101
- This is great.
- How did you land this place?

12:50.186 --> 12:52.145
It was pretty easy.

12:52.229 --> 12:55.899
A professor lived here for, like,
30 years, and then he died.

12:55.983 --> 12:57.525
That's awesome!

12:59.320 --> 13:00.653
That's awesome.

13:00.738 --> 13:02.822
A little housewarming.

13:03.199 --> 13:04.908
To new beginnings.

13:06.577 --> 13:07.869
Thanks.

13:10.289 --> 13:13.708
Actually,
I gave this to you for your wedding.

13:14.710 --> 13:16.085
This model?

13:16.545 --> 13:19.047
No, this exact one.

13:20.257 --> 13:21.800
I'm sorry.

13:21.884 --> 13:23.676
I'm embarrassed. I'm sorry.

13:23.761 --> 13:25.011
It's okay.

13:25.095 --> 13:26.679
I hope you like it.

13:27.389 --> 13:29.682
I love it. Thank you.

13:29.892 --> 13:31.810
This place is unbelievable.

13:31.894 --> 13:34.103
- You like it?
- How could you still be depressed?

13:34.188 --> 13:37.524
This is the best thing
that's happened to us.

13:37.608 --> 13:39.317
- Us?
- Yeah, us.

13:39.401 --> 13:42.153
Do not get selfish on me. Stay with me.

13:42.238 --> 13:44.113
Put a bar in over there, right?

13:44.198 --> 13:48.451
Couple La-Z-Boys, a smarter couch.
You could put a hot tub anywhere.

13:48.536 --> 13:50.912
Max, can you earmuff it for me?

13:52.039 --> 13:54.332
We'll get so much ass here,
it will be sick.

13:54.416 --> 13:56.459
I'm talking crazy, boy-band ass.

13:56.544 --> 13:58.044
That sounds like a lot of fun,

13:58.128 --> 14:01.297
but I need a little time
to get my life back together.

14:01.382 --> 14:04.968
We need to throw a big kick-ass party
to start things off.

14:05.052 --> 14:08.137
Absolutely.
Break it in, meet the neighbors.

14:08.222 --> 14:10.098
Come on, Mitch.
You know what I'm talking about.

14:10.182 --> 14:11.641
Break it in.

14:11.725 --> 14:14.853
The real estate guy was really adamant
about not having...

14:14.937 --> 14:17.897
I don't think you realize
what a huge opportunity this is for you.

14:17.982 --> 14:20.650
Girls love a guy in your situation.

14:20.734 --> 14:22.360
What situation?

14:22.486 --> 14:24.070
Mitch, you're on the rebound.

14:24.154 --> 14:26.865
Like an injured fawn
nursed back to health,

14:26.949 --> 14:30.034
who will finally be re-released
into the wilderness.

14:30.119 --> 14:32.662
- Sorry.
- Please be careful.

14:32.746 --> 14:35.373
I'm sorry. You okay? Say it to the baby.

14:35.457 --> 14:37.041
- You upset him.
- Sorry, baby.

14:37.126 --> 14:39.085
It's okay. It happens.

14:39.169 --> 14:41.546
We should go tropical with this thing.

14:41.630 --> 14:44.966
Sand from wall to wall.
I know a great sand guy.

14:45.050 --> 14:48.177
- Sand in here?
- Or foam, whatever. Something in here.

14:48.262 --> 14:51.389
- You understand what I'm talking about?
- Absolutely.

14:51.473 --> 14:54.851
I'm good either way.
Just need to run it by Marissa.

14:56.645 --> 14:58.855
I'm messing with you guys!

14:58.939 --> 15:01.858
It's not funny.
And now the baby is upset.

15:12.912 --> 15:13.995
Hey.

15:17.249 --> 15:19.834
- Hey!
- Hey, honey!

15:20.836 --> 15:22.337
I brought you an iced tea!

15:22.421 --> 15:25.048
No, thanks. I got a fresh beer.

15:25.132 --> 15:27.634
Can you turn that off for a second?

15:30.679 --> 15:33.973
Wow. That's really loud.

15:34.058 --> 15:35.266
Yeah. Thanks.

15:35.351 --> 15:38.561
I took the restrictor plate off,
give the Red Dragon a little more juice.

15:38.646 --> 15:42.941
But let's keep that on the down low.
She's not exactly street legal.

15:43.025 --> 15:44.108
Hey, Mike!

15:44.193 --> 15:45.234
Right.

15:45.319 --> 15:48.446
- So, what's up?
- Nothing much.

15:48.530 --> 15:51.282
I was hoping we might get to those
thank-you notes tomorrow night.

15:51.367 --> 15:54.118
Honey,
I got Mitch's thing tomorrow night.

15:54.203 --> 15:56.329
That's right. I totally forgot.

15:56.413 --> 15:58.206
But I can skip it.

15:58.290 --> 16:01.125
Oh, no. No!

16:01.210 --> 16:02.961
Don't be silly.

16:03.045 --> 16:06.631
I wouldn't want you
changing your whole life just for me.

16:08.133 --> 16:10.510
I'll give Lara a call
and we'll plan a girls' night.

16:10.594 --> 16:12.845
- It'll be fun.
- Thanks.

16:12.930 --> 16:14.472
You're the best.

16:15.516 --> 16:17.642
As long as you promise to take it easy.

16:17.726 --> 16:21.604
- What do you mean?
- You know exactly what I mean.

16:21.689 --> 16:23.147
You've come a long way
since Frank the Tank,

16:23.232 --> 16:25.108
and we don't want him coming back.

16:25.192 --> 16:28.736
Honey, Frank the Tank is
not coming back, okay?

16:28.821 --> 16:32.115
That part of me is over.
It's water under the bridge.

16:32.199 --> 16:33.533
I promise.

16:47.589 --> 16:50.466
- Nice, right?
- This is incredible. How did you do this?

16:50.551 --> 16:53.011
With all the people and the speakers.

16:53.095 --> 16:55.722
I thought we were having
a small get-together.

16:55.806 --> 16:58.391
This is one of many small get-togethers.

16:58.475 --> 17:00.393
That's why you got the house, brother.

17:00.477 --> 17:01.853
You're having fun?

17:01.937 --> 17:04.605
- I'm having a great time.
- Good.

17:04.690 --> 17:08.693
What else have you got planned?
A student band or something?

17:08.777 --> 17:10.069
Yeah, that's it.

17:10.154 --> 17:13.531
I got a student alt rock band
coming on stage next.

17:13.615 --> 17:15.199
I own six Speaker Cities.

17:15.284 --> 17:18.202
I'm worth $3.5 million
that the government knows about.

17:18.287 --> 17:21.204
I got more electronics up there
than a KISS concert.

17:21.290 --> 17:25.626
You think I'd roll out that kind of
red carpet for a fucking marching band?

17:25.711 --> 17:27.086
Make sure you can see the stage.

17:27.628 --> 17:29.297
Excuse me. Pardon me.

17:29.381 --> 17:32.967
I just want to get through this door,
if you don't mind.

17:33.052 --> 17:34.510
Thank you.

17:34.595 --> 17:37.096
This is the guy I was talking about.
This is his house.

17:37.181 --> 17:40.433
- What's up, man?
- No, that's my friend, Mitch.

17:40.517 --> 17:42.685
My friend, Mitch, he owns the house.

17:42.770 --> 17:46.856
Anyway, come hit this.
You need to hit this.

17:46.940 --> 17:50.943
No, I appreciate it, but I told my wife
I wouldn't drink tonight.

17:51.028 --> 17:54.113
I've got a big day tomorrow.
But you guys have a great time.

17:54.198 --> 17:56.908
A big day? Doing what?

17:56.992 --> 17:59.952
Well, actually, pretty nice little Saturday.

18:00.037 --> 18:02.330
We're going to Home Depot.

18:02.414 --> 18:05.541
Buy some wallpaper,
maybe get some flooring.

18:05.626 --> 18:08.211
Stuff like that.
Maybe Bed, Bath & Beyond.

18:08.295 --> 18:10.671
I don't know if we’ll have enough time.

18:13.342 --> 18:16.177
You know what?
Give me that thing. I'll do one.

18:16.261 --> 18:19.806
He gonna do one! He gonna do one!

18:19.890 --> 18:21.641
Do it!

18:23.936 --> 18:26.521
That's a talented man right there.

18:30.400 --> 18:32.443
- That's what I'm talking about.
- Fill it up again!

18:32.528 --> 18:35.780
God, that's good. It's so good!

18:35.864 --> 18:38.366
Once it hits your lips, it's so good.

18:38.450 --> 18:39.700
Thank you very much, guys.

18:39.785 --> 18:41.828
This will be happening
at this house all year.

18:41.912 --> 18:44.163
So don't burn yourselves out tonight.

18:44.248 --> 18:48.793
Thank you very much for coming to the
official Mitch Martin Freedom Festival.

18:52.089 --> 18:54.757
For those who don't know
who Mitch Martin is,

18:54.842 --> 18:56.342
he's the very successful,

18:56.426 --> 18:59.846
very disease-free gentleman
standing by the mini-bar.

19:04.101 --> 19:06.727
Now, courtesy of Speaker City,

19:06.812 --> 19:10.523
which slashes prices on everything
from beepers to DVD players,

19:10.607 --> 19:13.609
give a warm
Harrison University welcome

19:13.735 --> 19:19.240
to my pal and your favorite,
Mister Snoop Dogg.

19:23.787 --> 19:25.746
Yeah. Yeah.

19:27.457 --> 19:28.833
You know what?

19:28.917 --> 19:30.918
I'm thinking of a master plan

19:31.003 --> 19:33.337
'Cause ain't nothing
but sweat inside my hand

19:33.422 --> 19:35.756
So I dig into my pockets
All my money is spent

19:35.841 --> 19:38.259
So I dig deeper
But still coming up with lint

19:38.343 --> 19:40.678
So I start my mission
Leave my residence

19:40.762 --> 19:43.097
I'm thinking how can I get
Some dead presidents

19:54.568 --> 20:00.448
- Frank the Tank!
- Frank the Tank!

20:02.242 --> 20:05.369
You know it! You know it!

20:10.500 --> 20:12.710
A pen and a paper
A stereo, a tape

20:12.794 --> 20:16.214
Of me and Warren G
And a big, fat plate of chicken wings

20:16.298 --> 20:17.548
'Cause that's my favorite thing...

20:17.633 --> 20:20.134
- You're that guy.
- What?

20:20.219 --> 20:23.763
- Mitch-a-palooza, from the poster.
- Yeah, that's me.

20:23.847 --> 20:26.224
This party is great. Nice work.

20:26.308 --> 20:28.559
My friends put it on for me.

20:28.644 --> 20:32.230
They're kind of re-releasing me
out into the wild.

20:32.314 --> 20:34.565
What are you talking about?

20:34.650 --> 20:36.025
Nothing. Sorry.

20:36.401 --> 20:38.819
Got to have some thangs

20:38.904 --> 20:41.405
- So what you need is some game
- Say what, say what

20:41.490 --> 20:44.408
- To get your paper, man
- Say what, say what

20:44.493 --> 20:46.452
- Oh, baby
- Yeah, yeah

20:46.536 --> 20:48.621
In a world of paper, paper

20:48.830 --> 20:52.416
Did somebody say make money, money
Make money, money, money

20:52.501 --> 20:54.460
Make money, money
Make money, money, money

20:54.544 --> 20:57.255
Say, make money, money
Make money, money, money

20:57.339 --> 20:59.632
Make money, money
Make money, money, money

20:59.716 --> 21:00.967
Take money, money...

21:01.051 --> 21:03.177
We're going streaking!

21:09.059 --> 21:10.601
I'm sorry.

21:10.686 --> 21:15.398
We're going streaking through the quad
and into the gymnasium.

21:15.482 --> 21:16.732
Come on, everybody!

21:16.817 --> 21:18.567
Come on, Snoop!

21:19.278 --> 21:21.195
Snoop-a-loop! Snoop...

21:21.571 --> 21:23.781
No, it's cool. I'm cool.

21:23.865 --> 21:25.866
Bring your green hat.

21:25.951 --> 21:28.202
Come on, everybody, we're going!

21:28.287 --> 21:29.620
Here we go!

21:29.705 --> 21:32.790
Man, man. Man, put the music back on.

21:32.874 --> 21:35.543
Let's get the party back cracking up.

21:37.713 --> 21:41.299
Come on! We're streaking. Come on!

21:41.383 --> 21:44.093
Come on!
Come on, everybody, come on!

21:47.055 --> 21:50.224
We're streaking! We're streaking!

21:52.853 --> 21:53.978
Come on!

21:55.564 --> 21:58.482
- Tell her!
- Marissa, I totally forgot.

21:58.567 --> 22:02.820
It's a little belated, but we got you
the perfect wedding present.

22:02.904 --> 22:05.489
I told you,
you don't have to get me anything.

22:05.574 --> 22:08.284
Our friend Ashley
had this guy come over

22:08.368 --> 22:10.328
and teach a blow job class.

22:10.412 --> 22:12.830
- It was incredible.
- A class?

22:12.914 --> 22:15.833
And he's really good,
so we had to book him way in advance.

22:15.917 --> 22:17.335
Why should I go to a class?

22:17.419 --> 22:19.086
Bernard should be the one
going to class.

22:19.171 --> 22:21.088
The man is orally challenged.

22:22.132 --> 22:24.216
Wait a second, is that guy...

22:25.594 --> 22:27.386
Oh, my God.

22:28.680 --> 22:30.890
That's disgusting!

22:32.059 --> 22:33.893
Why am I looking at that?

22:34.895 --> 22:36.562
Why are you slowing down?

22:36.646 --> 22:38.689
Just drive. Go.

22:40.150 --> 22:41.650
Frank?

22:41.735 --> 22:43.444
No way.

22:45.572 --> 22:46.739
Frank!

22:47.407 --> 22:50.034
Hey, honey. Hey.

22:50.118 --> 22:52.036
What the hell are you doing?

22:52.120 --> 22:53.245
We're streaking.

22:53.330 --> 22:57.083
We're going up through the quad
to the gymnasium.

22:57.250 --> 22:59.001
Who's streaking?

22:59.086 --> 23:01.295
There's more coming.

23:01.797 --> 23:03.506
Frank, get in the car.

23:03.590 --> 23:05.549
- Everybody's doing it.
- Now!

23:05.634 --> 23:06.759
Okay.

23:12.641 --> 23:14.058
Scooch over.

23:17.687 --> 23:19.146
Oh. Hey.

23:19.648 --> 23:21.649
Hey, ladies.

23:21.733 --> 23:23.317
Hey, Frank.

23:23.402 --> 23:25.986
Looks like it's a little cold out there,
huh?

23:28.031 --> 23:29.573
Please, guys.

23:30.158 --> 23:32.827
Honey, do you think KFC is still open?

23:48.051 --> 23:49.385
Oh.

23:49.886 --> 23:51.637
Oh, shit.

23:54.891 --> 23:56.392
Good morning.

23:57.978 --> 23:59.854
Now, that was a party.

24:03.650 --> 24:05.943
Since when are you so shy?

24:06.027 --> 24:07.653
No, I'm not. I just...

24:07.737 --> 24:11.031
Did I snore last night?
Sometimes I snore when I'm drunk.

24:12.159 --> 24:14.702
I don't remember.

24:14.786 --> 24:16.745
I don't think so.

24:18.874 --> 24:21.876
Listen, about last night.

24:22.502 --> 24:26.630
I just got out of a very serious
and traumatic relationship.

24:28.216 --> 24:30.926
I'm kind of in a weird place right now.

24:31.720 --> 24:32.928
What?

24:33.221 --> 24:35.723
Relax, Rich, it's not a big deal.

24:36.683 --> 24:39.393
Mitch, with an "M."

24:40.395 --> 24:42.438
Right. Look...

24:43.356 --> 24:45.274
Whatever.
We were just having a little fun.

24:45.358 --> 24:47.818
You have nothing to worry about.

24:47.903 --> 24:49.195
No.

24:49.279 --> 24:51.614
Yeah, you're right. I'm okay with it.

24:51.698 --> 24:56.911
- It's casual. I was just...
- I got to go to class, so...

24:56.995 --> 25:00.164
So, how do we do this? Shall I...

25:00.248 --> 25:02.166
You want to leave me your number?

25:02.250 --> 25:04.919
- You don't even have to worry about it.
- Okay.

25:08.840 --> 25:10.591
See you around.

25:13.470 --> 25:14.595
Bye.

25:16.598 --> 25:17.765
I love you.

25:18.183 --> 25:20.434
At Speaker City,
we're slashing prices on everything

25:20.519 --> 25:23.354
from DVD players, to camcorders,
and everything in between.

25:23.438 --> 25:26.440
Our courteous staff will educate you
on a wide selection

25:26.525 --> 25:29.318
of state-of-the-art home theater
equipment and accessories.

25:29.402 --> 25:32.029
Show us a competitor's price.
We'll beat it.

25:32.113 --> 25:35.866
If we can't beat it, I'll give you the keys
to the store. Literally.

25:35.951 --> 25:37.076
Figuratively, I mean.

25:37.160 --> 25:40.496
The only thing that sounds better than
our speakers are our prices!

25:40.580 --> 25:41.830
Hi, silly kid.

25:42.916 --> 25:46.001
What do you think? Honestly.
Shoot me straight.

25:46.086 --> 25:47.211
Really good.

25:47.295 --> 25:49.547
- You look great.
- Really?

25:49.631 --> 25:53.384
- Yeah.
- God, I went a little bit...

25:53.468 --> 25:55.719
- Got crazy last night.
- Yeah.

25:55.804 --> 25:58.931
I still haven't heard from Frank.
I'm worried.

25:59.015 --> 26:00.182
Hello?

26:02.811 --> 26:04.395
Come on in.

26:04.479 --> 26:06.897
Is this one of your guys here?

26:06.982 --> 26:10.317
- Three fire hazards over here.
- What are you doing?

26:13.488 --> 26:16.991
Cheese, is that you?

26:17.492 --> 26:21.745
Hello, Mitch, Bernard.
See you guys haven't changed much.

26:21.830 --> 26:22.830
Who is this?

26:22.914 --> 26:25.249
Remember Cheese,
Rodney's kid brother?

26:25.333 --> 26:27.084
Actually,
my name isn't Cheese anymore.

26:27.168 --> 26:28.294
It's Gordon Pritchard.

26:28.378 --> 26:30.129
Oh, yeah.

26:30.380 --> 26:32.214
Cheese.

26:32.299 --> 26:34.758
Didn't we lock you in a dumpster once?

26:34.843 --> 26:36.594
I got out.

26:36.678 --> 26:39.346
Cool, man. I'm glad you did.

26:42.017 --> 26:44.101
- You had a good time last night?
- Yeah.

26:44.185 --> 26:47.688
There might be some whippits
lying around if you want them.

26:47.772 --> 26:50.274
- No, thanks. I'm working.
- Working what?

26:50.358 --> 26:52.359
Campus patrol?

26:52.444 --> 26:54.695
- Try again.
- You a Jehovah's Witness?

26:55.530 --> 26:58.949
I'm the dean. Dean Pritchard. Yeah.

26:59.034 --> 27:02.036
And as of this morning,
this house has been rezoned.

27:02.621 --> 27:06.415
It is now exclusively
for campus use only.

27:06.499 --> 27:08.709
What are you talking about?
You can't do that.

27:08.793 --> 27:11.712
I've already paid
the first and last month's rent.

27:11.796 --> 27:13.797
Look at that.

27:13.882 --> 27:15.507
You have a week
to vacate the premises,

27:15.592 --> 27:17.551
and I thank you for your cooperation.

27:17.636 --> 27:18.886
Great.

27:19.304 --> 27:21.138
- Can I ask you a question?
- Absolutely not.

27:21.222 --> 27:24.558
It's been good seeing you.
It looks like you're doing great.

27:36.446 --> 27:39.156
Frank, this is a safe place.

27:39.240 --> 27:42.951
It's a place where we can feel free
sharing our feelings.

27:43.036 --> 27:47.498
Think of my office as a nest
in a tree of trust and understanding.

27:47.582 --> 27:49.667
We can say anything here.

27:49.751 --> 27:51.043
Anything?

27:52.671 --> 27:55.297
It's okay, honey. That's why we came.

27:58.927 --> 28:04.598
Well, I guess I...
Deep down I'm feeling a little confused.

28:05.100 --> 28:08.519
I mean, suddenly you get married

28:08.603 --> 28:10.938
and you're supposed to be
this entirely different guy.

28:11.022 --> 28:13.357
I don't feel different.

28:13.441 --> 28:15.943
Take yesterday, for example.

28:16.027 --> 28:20.114
We were out at the Olive Garden
for dinner, which was lovely.

28:20.198 --> 28:23.659
And I happened to look over
during the meal

28:23.743 --> 28:26.829
and see a waitress taking an order,

28:26.913 --> 28:31.917
and I found myself wondering
what color her underpants might be.

28:33.086 --> 28:34.628
Her panties.

28:37.298 --> 28:41.844
Odds are they're probably basic white,
cotton underpants.

28:41.928 --> 28:46.640
But I started thinking,
"Well, maybe they're silk panties.

28:46.725 --> 28:48.392
"Maybe it's a thong.

28:48.476 --> 28:53.897
"Maybe it's something really cool
that I don't even know about."

28:53.982 --> 28:56.900
You know? And I started feeling...

28:58.111 --> 28:59.570
What?

28:59.654 --> 29:01.905
I thought we were in the trust tree,
in the nest.

29:01.990 --> 29:05.325
- Are we not?
- We are. It's okay.

29:06.661 --> 29:09.580
It's okay. Please continue.

29:10.206 --> 29:12.666
I don't know where I was going with that.

29:15.003 --> 29:18.255
I guess what I'm trying to say
is that now that I'm married,

29:18.339 --> 29:22.092
I'm definitely feeling
a little freaked out about the fact

29:22.177 --> 29:27.806
that I'm gonna have sex
with only one person

29:27.891 --> 29:29.975
for the rest of my life.

29:31.519 --> 29:34.563
Walsh tells me
your San Diego trip was a blast!

29:35.148 --> 29:37.483
- Yeah.
- How was Hooters?

29:37.567 --> 29:39.985
I actually didn't go to Hooters.

29:40.361 --> 29:41.862
Yeah, right.

29:41.988 --> 29:44.198
- Skittles?
- No, thanks.

29:44.282 --> 29:46.658
Listen. I got a call from Manetti.

29:46.743 --> 29:50.829
He tells me that your Sunshine Square
proposal is totally fucked.

29:51.498 --> 29:52.539
What's wrong with it?

29:52.624 --> 29:56.251
For one thing, it violates the zoning
restrictions set forth

29:56.336 --> 29:59.630
in the National Historical
Preservation Act of 1966.

29:59.714 --> 30:02.216
Most notably, clause four.

30:02.842 --> 30:03.967
Shall I continue?

30:04.052 --> 30:06.386
- I'm familiar with that item...
- Honey.

30:06.471 --> 30:08.639
- Dad, am I interrupting?
- No, come in.

30:08.723 --> 30:10.224
- Hi.
- Hey.

30:10.308 --> 30:14.436
I don't think you've met my daughter.
Darcie, this is Mitch Martin.

30:15.814 --> 30:19.191
- Nice to meet you, Mitch.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

30:19.692 --> 30:23.612
- How was the slumber party?
- Great. Movies and popcorn.

30:24.364 --> 30:25.948
She's an angel.

30:27.200 --> 30:28.659
It makes me sound old,

30:28.743 --> 30:30.494
but I can't believe
how fast she's growing up.

30:30.578 --> 30:33.455
- Dad, stop.
- I'm sorry, but it's true.

30:33.540 --> 30:37.417
To think that in just seven months
you'll be graduating from high school.

30:40.839 --> 30:42.589
You okay?

30:43.174 --> 30:47.052
- I thought you said high school.
- Yeah. Shocking, isn't it?

30:48.263 --> 30:49.596
Yes, it is.

30:49.931 --> 30:51.306
I'm sorry.

30:58.565 --> 31:00.274
Give me a break.

31:00.483 --> 31:01.859
Hey, Mitch.

31:05.822 --> 31:08.907
Hey, man. Did you have a good day?

31:08.992 --> 31:10.784
Not too bad.

31:12.036 --> 31:13.662
What's going on?

31:14.122 --> 31:16.206
I thought maybe
I could crash here tonight,

31:16.291 --> 31:17.708
if that's all right.

31:17.792 --> 31:20.627
Marissa is going through
some personal stuff.

31:22.297 --> 31:26.592
Personal stuff like you running through
the neighborhood drunk and naked?

31:26.676 --> 31:30.304
That and some other stuff.

31:32.181 --> 31:35.183
- No problem. Make yourself at home.
- Thanks.

31:36.895 --> 31:39.813
Gentlemen, we're discussing
a brand-new way to look at a fraternity.

31:39.898 --> 31:45.235
In other words, forget the normal rules
that apply to college and society,

31:45.320 --> 31:48.030
because this is a very big idea,
my friends.

31:48.114 --> 31:52.242
We are talking about a non-exclusive,
egalitarian brotherhood

31:52.327 --> 31:55.203
where community status
and more importantly, age,

31:55.288 --> 31:57.414
have no bearing whatsoever.

31:58.666 --> 32:00.667
Yeah?
From the guy who probably won't get in.

32:00.752 --> 32:03.128
- I go to school here.
- Okay.

32:03.212 --> 32:08.008
I was curious, what association
will you have with the actual university?

32:08.092 --> 32:09.760
- Who are these people?
- I don't know.

32:09.844 --> 32:13.221
Legally speaking,
there will be a loose affiliation,

32:13.306 --> 32:16.683
but we will give nothing back
to the academic community.

32:16.768 --> 32:19.353
As well as provide
no public service of any kind.

32:19.437 --> 32:20.729
This much I promise.

32:20.813 --> 32:23.023
What the hell is going on here?

32:23.107 --> 32:25.359
Guys, this is a very special occasion.

32:25.443 --> 32:29.571
The Godfather himself has been kind
enough to grace us with his presence.

32:29.656 --> 32:30.781
The Godfather!

32:30.865 --> 32:33.992
This is his damn house.
He sleeps 20 feet away.

32:36.704 --> 32:38.830
We need to talk.

32:38.915 --> 32:40.499
Kitchen.

32:41.459 --> 32:45.128
Sit good for me. I'm gonna talk
to Uncle Mitch for a second.

32:45.213 --> 32:46.421
There you go, buddy.

32:46.506 --> 32:48.298
How long have these people been here?

32:48.383 --> 32:49.383
All day.

32:49.467 --> 32:52.386
That party we had last night
has given us all kinds of street cred.

32:52.470 --> 32:54.346
What are you talking about?

32:54.430 --> 32:57.557
This is called "rush."
We're officially starting a fraternity.

32:57.642 --> 33:01.228
- I like it. It's genius.
- You've got to be kidding me.

33:01.312 --> 33:03.397
You heard Pritchard.
We're obligated to do this.

33:03.481 --> 33:08.110
This house is zoned specifically
for social services and student housing.

33:08.194 --> 33:09.653
Fraternity solves both of those.

33:09.737 --> 33:12.322
But this is my house. I live here, Beanie.

33:12.407 --> 33:15.534
I'm 30 years old.
None of us are enrolled in the college.

33:15.618 --> 33:19.538
I understand that. You're focused
on all the wrong sort of details.

33:19.622 --> 33:22.332
Did you or did you not have a good time
at the party?

33:22.417 --> 33:25.002
I had an awesome time.

33:25.086 --> 33:26.920
I know you had an awesome time.

33:27.005 --> 33:29.423
The entire town knows
you had an awesome time.

33:29.507 --> 33:31.925
I'm trying to ask Mitch
whether he had an awesome time.

33:32.010 --> 33:33.802
- I had a good time.
- That's good.

33:33.886 --> 33:35.846
Wouldn't you want those good times
to keep going?

33:35.930 --> 33:38.515
- More good...
- God. I mean...

33:38.599 --> 33:39.850
I don't understand.

33:39.934 --> 33:42.185
I don't know why it's so hard
for you to admit you want this.

33:42.270 --> 33:45.397
We got 40 guys that want this.
There must be a reason for it.

33:45.481 --> 33:47.983
I appreciate your enthusiasm.

33:48.067 --> 33:52.029
I know you guys are trying to help,
but the truth of the matter is

33:52.113 --> 33:55.699
I've had a hell of a day,
an even worse month.

33:55.783 --> 33:59.703
And the fact is, I've got 40 strangers
out in my living room

33:59.787 --> 34:02.664
and all I want to do
is get some fucking sleep.

34:02.749 --> 34:07.002
So I'm sorry,
but we're not starting a fraternity.

34:07.086 --> 34:10.213
I don't know why you got to do it
in front of the kid, with the "effing."

34:10.297 --> 34:11.882
All you got to do
is say "earmuffs" to him.

34:11.966 --> 34:14.342
Then you can say "fuck, shit, bitch,"
whatever you want.

34:14.427 --> 34:15.469
Cock. Balls.

34:15.553 --> 34:18.764
I'm just proving a point.
You don't have to celebrate it, Frank.

34:18.848 --> 34:21.099
- Sorry.
- Take them off. Don't say sorry to me.

34:21.184 --> 34:24.018
You let down Frank, you let down me,
you let down Max.

34:24.103 --> 34:26.228
And right about now,
I'm having a real hard time

34:26.313 --> 34:29.858
trying to figure out why I take my time
to try to help you get over...

34:29.942 --> 34:32.444
Earmuffs. That whore that you dated.

34:32.527 --> 34:36.156
Wanna go out and see the other guys?
Uncle Mitch is sorry.

34:38.367 --> 34:40.534
Say yes. Yes.

34:47.835 --> 34:52.380
Here's the deal. Listen up!
All together, we've picked 14 pledges.

34:53.132 --> 34:54.966
Wait, who's this guy?

34:55.051 --> 34:56.134
That's Blue.

34:56.219 --> 34:58.929
He's an old Navy vet
who hangs around my store.

34:59.013 --> 35:00.514
But don't worry. He's legit.

35:00.598 --> 35:03.183
He looks like he's 100 years old.
He wants to pledge?

35:03.267 --> 35:07.479
Are you kidding me? The Old Man River
won't shut up about it.

35:07.563 --> 35:09.481
Go time!

35:24.705 --> 35:27.290
Don't make this any harder on yourself!

35:39.887 --> 35:41.221
What's going on?

35:41.305 --> 35:43.640
You tell anyone about this,
I'll fucking kill you!

35:43.724 --> 35:46.143
I'm kidding. We'll have him back tonight.
Okay, sweetie?

35:46.227 --> 35:47.519
Let's go!

35:59.574 --> 36:02.200
Come on, let's go. There we go, Blue.

36:12.086 --> 36:13.670
Congratulations, gentlemen.

36:13.754 --> 36:16.006
You should all be very proud
of yourselves.

36:16.090 --> 36:19.134
Each and every one of you
has been hand-picked

36:19.218 --> 36:23.263
to represent our inaugural pledge class.

36:23.347 --> 36:26.016
Over the next 21 days,

36:26.100 --> 36:32.355
you're all going to experience intense
mental and physical strain.

36:34.442 --> 36:36.526
Frank, just pace yourself.

36:37.570 --> 36:40.697
Copy that. Just got a little overexcited.
Sorry.

36:40.781 --> 36:45.368
At this point,
you may be asking yourself,

36:45.453 --> 36:49.956
"Why am I holding this
30-pound cinderblock in my hands?"

36:51.584 --> 36:54.878
You might also ask yourself,

36:54.962 --> 36:57.672
"Why does this cinderblock

36:57.757 --> 37:02.677
"have a long piece of string tied to it?"

37:03.471 --> 37:07.557
And finally,

37:07.642 --> 37:13.313
"Why's the other end of this string
tied securely to your penis?"

37:15.274 --> 37:18.526
And the answer, ladies, is trust.

37:19.695 --> 37:22.906
This is your first test.

37:23.699 --> 37:25.283
Spanish!

37:25.368 --> 37:27.452
Do you trust we've provided you
with enough slack

37:27.536 --> 37:30.247
so your block will land safely
on the lawn?

37:30.331 --> 37:31.873
Sir, yes, sir.

37:31.958 --> 37:33.625
- And, Blue!
- Yes, sir?

37:33.709 --> 37:36.378
Do you trust that I do not
want to see you die tonight?

37:36.462 --> 37:38.922
- Sir, yes, sir.
- You're my boy!

37:39.006 --> 37:40.507
Thank you, sir.

37:42.635 --> 37:44.010
About face.

37:47.556 --> 37:49.266
Step to the edge!

37:52.895 --> 37:56.022
Pledges, prepare to release!

37:57.942 --> 37:59.109
One,

37:59.819 --> 38:00.986
two,

38:01.821 --> 38:03.530
three, release!

38:15.042 --> 38:17.085
Wasn't meant to happen like that,
Weensie!

38:17.169 --> 38:19.713
Walk it off, big guy.
We're coming down.

38:20.464 --> 38:24.467
One, two, three, four.

38:24.552 --> 38:26.636
I've been laid more times than God

38:26.721 --> 38:28.805
Got six kids in Laung-Pau-Lad

38:28.889 --> 38:31.141
- Two, three, four!
- Two, three, four!

38:31.225 --> 38:33.268
- One, two, three, four.
- One, two, three, four.

38:33.352 --> 38:38.148
I don't know, but it's been said
One more lap and I'll be dead

38:38.232 --> 38:39.733
Faster!

38:41.736 --> 38:44.154
Jesus. Who are these people?

38:47.325 --> 38:49.784
Patricia, get security to the south lawn.

38:49.869 --> 38:52.412
We have an illegal off-road vehicle
operating without a permit.

38:52.496 --> 38:54.581
They've already been called, sir.

38:55.541 --> 38:57.334
Call them again.

39:02.006 --> 39:06.718
It's been two weeks.
How are these guys still a fraternity?

39:06.802 --> 39:08.136
They're not a fraternity, sir.

39:08.220 --> 39:11.264
They've been approved for
temporary status by the student council.

39:11.349 --> 39:13.475
Half these guys
don't even go to the school.

39:13.559 --> 39:15.685
You see the one guy? He's, like, 90.

39:15.770 --> 39:18.563
Technically, that doesn't matter.
They found a loophole.

39:18.647 --> 39:21.858
- A loophole?
- Yes. It's interesting, sir.

39:21.942 --> 39:24.944
As stupid as they appear,
they're actually very good at paperwork.

39:25.029 --> 39:27.447
It's quite an anomaly.

39:27.531 --> 39:30.075
I'm sorry, is that funny?
Are you a stand-up comic?

39:30.159 --> 39:31.868
Is that what you do now?

39:34.955 --> 39:37.040
This is me leaving. This is me leaving.

39:48.844 --> 39:50.387
There he is.

39:51.347 --> 39:52.847
What's going on, brother?

39:52.932 --> 39:55.558
Nothing. Just making some copies.

39:56.644 --> 39:57.977
See you later.

39:58.062 --> 40:00.188
Hey, Mitch, hang on a second.

40:00.272 --> 40:03.400
I heard you guys
are starting up a fraternity.

40:03.484 --> 40:06.986
- Who told you that?
- Nobody. Is it true?

40:07.071 --> 40:09.656
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Right.

40:09.740 --> 40:12.033
It sounds cool, man. I want in.

40:13.035 --> 40:16.162
Listen to me. There is no fraternity.

40:16.539 --> 40:18.581
I don't even know
what you're talking about.

40:18.666 --> 40:21.793
You listen to me. I need this, okay?

40:21.877 --> 40:25.964
My wife, my job, my kids.
Every day is exactly the same.

40:26.048 --> 40:28.425
I go golfing on Sundays.

40:28.509 --> 40:30.593
I hate golf.

40:30.678 --> 40:32.887
Don't blackball me, Mitch. Please.

40:32.972 --> 40:36.266
I am not blackballing you.
We work together, Walsh.

40:36.350 --> 40:40.270
And I don't want to mix work
with whatever it is I do at home.

40:40.354 --> 40:43.064
Trust me, you're not missing anything,
anyways.

40:43.149 --> 40:44.357
Really?

40:44.442 --> 40:46.526
Heard you hooked up
with Goldberg's daughter.

40:46.610 --> 40:48.653
Oh. Sorry.

40:48.737 --> 40:50.071
Sorry.

40:50.865 --> 40:52.532
That is untrue!

40:57.037 --> 40:59.456
Mitch, all I'm saying is think about it,
okay?

40:59.540 --> 41:00.874
Think about it!

41:01.625 --> 41:03.126
Who cares if you work with the guy?

41:03.210 --> 41:05.837
I do. I have a career to worry about.

41:05.921 --> 41:07.172
You're killing me.

41:07.256 --> 41:09.632
You really need to start embracing
this whole thing.

41:09.717 --> 41:13.178
I don't think you appreciate everything
I've done for you.

41:13.262 --> 41:14.846
- For me?
- Yeah, for you.

41:14.930 --> 41:18.308
You think I like avoiding my wife and
kids to hang out with 19-year-old girls?

41:18.392 --> 41:19.976
- Yeah, I do.
- Well, I don't, man.

41:20.060 --> 41:22.437
- I'm doing this for you.
- Hello.

41:22.521 --> 41:25.607
Nicole, how's it going? Who's this?

41:25.691 --> 41:27.942
This is my daughter, Amanda. Say hi.

41:28.027 --> 41:30.403
Hi, Amanda.
You remember Nicole, right?

41:30.488 --> 41:33.740
Yeah, we did a little chicken dancing
at the wedding, actually.

41:33.824 --> 41:35.992
- How you been?
- Fine, thanks.

41:36.076 --> 41:37.118
Good.

41:37.203 --> 41:40.079
I actually wanted to apologize to you
about the wedding.

41:40.164 --> 41:41.873
I hope I didn't embarrass you.

41:41.957 --> 41:44.918
It's okay.
You just embarrassed yourself.

41:45.002 --> 41:48.922
- I brought you a housewarming gift.
- That is really nice.

41:49.006 --> 41:52.258
It's just a CD holder for your desk.
I thought it was...

41:52.343 --> 41:54.928
That thing's a piece of crap. Awful.

41:56.388 --> 41:59.474
- I stopped selling it months ago.
- Please, Beanie.

41:59.558 --> 42:00.808
- Thanks.
- A lot of complaints.

42:00.893 --> 42:02.769
But it's a nice gesture.

42:03.270 --> 42:04.812
Hey, Godfather!

42:04.897 --> 42:07.106
- What's up?
- You the man, dog!

42:07.191 --> 42:08.858
See you around, homey!

42:08.943 --> 42:10.944
Did that guy just call you the Godfather?

42:11.028 --> 42:13.863
Must be joking around or something.

42:13.948 --> 42:15.240
Where are you guys living now?

42:15.324 --> 42:18.535
We're staying with my dad for a while,
until I find something better.

42:18.619 --> 42:20.578
The move's been rough on Amanda.

42:20.663 --> 42:25.083
My son Max is turning six on Sunday.
We're having a birthday party for him.

42:25.167 --> 42:27.460
Just, like, petting zoo and clowns.

42:27.545 --> 42:29.587
But you guys are welcome to come.

42:29.672 --> 42:32.131
That's a great idea. You should come.

42:32.216 --> 42:35.510
What do you guys like better?
Nurse or cheerleader?

42:37.471 --> 42:38.930
Hi, Nicole.

42:39.348 --> 42:40.807
Hi, Frank.

42:40.891 --> 42:43.560
It's a nice doll you have there.

42:43.644 --> 42:45.645
Yeah, thanks. She's okay.

42:46.647 --> 42:48.982
Did you have fun at the wedding?

42:49.066 --> 42:50.817
Yeah, it was fun.

42:52.319 --> 42:54.779
I'm just staying here for right now.

42:55.030 --> 42:58.658
- Anyways, we'll see you Sunday.
- Sunday, right. Okay.

42:58.742 --> 43:01.202
- Bye. Say bye.
- Bye.

43:02.204 --> 43:03.288
Bye.

43:10.296 --> 43:12.338
- Hi, you've reached Marissa.
- And Frank!

43:12.423 --> 43:14.757
We're not here. Leave us a message.

43:14.842 --> 43:16.509
Hey, honey, it's me.

43:17.177 --> 43:20.096
Listen, just was calling to check in.

43:20.180 --> 43:24.183
I been kind of busy lately.
A lot of paperwork, stuff like that.

43:24.268 --> 43:25.268
Damn it.

43:25.352 --> 43:29.689
If you are satisfied, press "1."
To rerecord, press "2."

43:30.649 --> 43:33.610
Hey, Marissa, it's me. Listen.

43:33.694 --> 43:36.279
Gonna be in the neighborhood
a little bit later.

43:36.363 --> 43:39.907
Didn't know if you wanted to get
together for frozen yogurt sometime,

43:39.992 --> 43:42.285
or maybe even a whole meal of food.

43:42.369 --> 43:44.871
If that'd be agreeable... Stupid.

43:44.955 --> 43:49.125
If you are satisfied, press "1."
To rerecord, press "2."

43:50.127 --> 43:52.712
Hey, Marissa, it's Frank Ricard...

43:54.256 --> 43:55.465
Okay, ladies.

43:55.549 --> 43:58.551
The secret to a good B.J. Is focus.

43:58.636 --> 44:01.137
I don't care if it's your husband
of 10 years

44:01.221 --> 44:05.642
or some hot sailor you met
at T.G.I. Friday's a couple months ago.

44:06.393 --> 44:07.518
Who never did call me back.

44:07.603 --> 44:10.772
But did leave me
with a little something called "herpes."

44:11.148 --> 44:13.399
Which I then gave to the dog.

44:14.693 --> 44:17.070
But that's neither here nor there.

44:17.154 --> 44:18.738
Grab your vegetables.

44:25.746 --> 44:28.289
Who's hungry? Who's hungry?

44:28.374 --> 44:30.291
Come on. Is this guy for real?

44:30.376 --> 44:33.795
Yeah, he's fine. He's the best there is.

44:33.879 --> 44:36.631
Ladies, our thumbs are down,
our wrists are flexed,

44:36.715 --> 44:39.467
and we're positioning ourselves
for insertion.

44:41.970 --> 44:43.805
Ready? Do it.

44:48.185 --> 44:49.602
Good, Marissa.
You can use a little teeth,

44:49.687 --> 44:51.938
but you don't want to be a biter.

44:54.441 --> 44:56.067
You're gonna do the work, ladies.

44:56.151 --> 44:59.112
These carrots
won't ejaculate themselves.

44:59.196 --> 45:02.615
Get into it. Very good.

45:03.200 --> 45:06.744
Good. Good. Not so good.

45:06.829 --> 45:10.164
Please, you're not Romulus
sucking on the teats of the mother wolf.

45:10.249 --> 45:12.041
If you know your Greek mythology.

45:12.126 --> 45:13.793
We are giving head,

45:13.877 --> 45:16.462
not breast-feeding
from a mythological beast.

45:18.048 --> 45:19.465
Funny?

45:19.550 --> 45:22.176
You won't be laughing when somebody
prematurely pops in your face.

45:22.261 --> 45:25.930
It stings
and that is now why I have a lazy eye.

45:26.014 --> 45:28.725
Thank you. Please continue.

45:28.809 --> 45:30.351
Up and in.

45:31.812 --> 45:34.063
And mind the stepchildren.

45:34.148 --> 45:36.107
Mind the stepchildren.

45:54.001 --> 45:57.128
Marissa, come on. That's it.

46:01.133 --> 46:03.760
I like what I see.
Don't be afraid to arch it.

46:05.804 --> 46:08.514
Marissa, come on. That's it.

46:11.351 --> 46:14.604
Everybody can learn from Marissa.
I'm gonna take a quick five.

46:14.688 --> 46:16.397
You guys continue.

46:17.566 --> 46:18.900
Good one!

46:18.984 --> 46:20.818
Nice work, Marissa.

46:21.820 --> 46:24.113
Way to give 110%.

46:24.865 --> 46:27.450
When I get back there,
I'm gonna show you something I call

46:27.534 --> 46:29.744
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Penis."

46:31.246 --> 46:32.371
Did you see that movie?

46:32.456 --> 46:36.042
I really like it
'cause of the flying and the magic.

46:37.836 --> 46:39.504
Bastard!

46:39.588 --> 46:42.006
Someone just made a bad mistake!

46:50.849 --> 46:54.060
Jesus Christ, Frank!
What the hell are you doing here?

46:54.144 --> 46:55.645
You know this person?

46:55.729 --> 46:58.064
I am so sorry. Are you hurt?

46:58.148 --> 46:59.816
Yes, I'm hurt.

47:05.864 --> 47:08.115
Bob's not here. They're on the rocks.

47:11.537 --> 47:14.121
You've outdone yourself once again.

47:14.206 --> 47:17.166
It's nice, right?
Spanish, what the hell are you doing?

47:17.251 --> 47:19.836
I'm just getting some water.
This suit is crazy hot.

47:19.920 --> 47:23.422
Put your head on. Are you nuts?
That can be very traumatic for kids.

47:23.507 --> 47:26.008
- I'm sorry.
- Don't "sorry" me.

47:26.093 --> 47:28.511
Shake the tail when you walk.
You're better than that.

47:28.595 --> 47:29.929
Take it easy.

47:30.013 --> 47:31.848
You don't see me
breaking the fourth wall.

47:31.932 --> 47:33.641
- Hi, guys.
- Hey.

47:33.725 --> 47:35.685
- Nice costume.
- Thanks a lot.

47:35.769 --> 47:37.854
- This is a great party.
- When'd you get here?

47:37.938 --> 47:40.898
Just a few minutes ago.
This is my boyfriend, Mark.

47:40.983 --> 47:44.735
Flew over from Colorado yesterday.
This is Mitch and Beanie.

47:44.820 --> 47:46.028
How's it hanging, boys?

47:46.113 --> 47:47.530
Pleasure.

47:47.614 --> 47:52.368
So listen, somebody told me
you guys are in a fraternity, is that right?

47:52.452 --> 47:54.871
- No.
- Is that true?

47:55.622 --> 47:59.500
Not really. I mean, no.
It's more kind of like a social club.

47:59.585 --> 48:02.169
We just watch football and hang out.

48:02.796 --> 48:04.714
Hang out and spank each other, I bet.

48:04.798 --> 48:06.549
It's not like that.
We don't take it too seriously...

48:06.633 --> 48:09.969
Blue! How come there's no ice
in my lemonade?

48:10.429 --> 48:13.806
- Sorry, sir!
- You drop down and you give me 10!

48:14.433 --> 48:17.393
Now! Let's go!

48:17.477 --> 48:18.561
It's Frank.

48:19.730 --> 48:22.565
I'm gonna give you these.
It's my work phone. Call me.

48:22.649 --> 48:24.358
I own all six locations.

48:25.193 --> 48:26.819
Max wants to open up his gifts,

48:26.904 --> 48:28.738
but I thought maybe one
would be all right?

48:28.822 --> 48:31.574
Come on in here, Maxy.
You guys mind giving me a minute?

48:31.658 --> 48:34.243
We'll talk surround sound later.
I'll cut you a deal.

48:34.328 --> 48:36.579
I'm not gonna hold you
over the coals for it.

48:36.663 --> 48:38.080
How you doing, bud?

48:38.165 --> 48:40.875
We can open Uncle Frank's,
but we got to wait for the others.

48:40.959 --> 48:43.920
I don't know who's more excited,
Frank or Max.

48:44.004 --> 48:46.756
Rip it up! Go at it there. What is it?

48:46.840 --> 48:49.675
Could it be a space ship?
Let's see what we got!

48:49.760 --> 48:52.428
Yeah!

48:53.096 --> 48:56.140
What do you think, Max?
It's got three speeds.

49:03.190 --> 49:04.523
Damn it.

49:08.737 --> 49:11.238
Excuse me. I'll have one of those.

49:13.200 --> 49:14.742
I'm Mark. What's your name?

49:14.826 --> 49:16.535
- Tracy.
- Right.

49:17.788 --> 49:20.164
Nice meeting you... Tracy.

49:20.582 --> 49:23.292
- Right on there.
- There we go.

49:23.543 --> 49:25.795
Okay,
you can go back out and play now.

49:25.879 --> 49:27.254
Come on.

49:27.339 --> 49:29.215
There. Take your doll.

49:32.886 --> 49:35.304
I think she likes you.
She ignores most people.

49:35.389 --> 49:37.223
I feel honored.

49:38.976 --> 49:43.479
So, Mark,
he seems like an interesting guy.

49:43.563 --> 49:45.147
He's harmless.

49:45.232 --> 49:48.693
- How long have you been together?
- Two years.

49:48.777 --> 49:52.530
I told him I had a crush on you in
high school and I think I got him jealous.

49:52.614 --> 49:54.615
You had a crush on me?

49:54.700 --> 49:57.702
You got to be kidding me.
I was obsessed with you.

49:57.786 --> 49:59.161
Not in a dangerous way.

49:59.246 --> 50:02.289
I just watched you a lot,
from a distance.

50:02.708 --> 50:04.375
How come you never asked me out?

50:04.459 --> 50:07.044
You were pretty intimidating back then.

50:07.462 --> 50:11.841
You were always with older guys.
You had that Whitesnake jean jacket.

50:11.925 --> 50:15.052
You smoked Marlboro Reds.
You were way out of my league.

50:17.097 --> 50:19.765
I still have the Whitesnake jean jacket.

50:20.600 --> 50:23.769
I'm still pretty intimidated by you.

50:30.235 --> 50:33.779
- You're bad.
- You're right. I am bad.

50:36.908 --> 50:38.784
Oh, jeez, I'm sorry...

50:38.869 --> 50:41.037
- I guess we're not knocking?
- Excuse me.

50:41.121 --> 50:43.456
Excuse me, I've got to get back to work.

50:43.540 --> 50:46.208
Just returning these Band-Aids.

50:47.586 --> 50:50.046
What are you gonna do? Tell on me?

50:50.130 --> 50:53.174
You know you can't, buddy.
It's guy code. Okay?

50:53.967 --> 50:57.636
Guys don't tell on other guys.
That's something chicks do.

51:01.141 --> 51:03.225
You're not a chick, are you?

51:05.937 --> 51:07.271
All right.

51:08.148 --> 51:10.274
Good talk. I'll see you out there.

51:18.492 --> 51:20.326
Hey there, buddy.

51:20.410 --> 51:22.161
Need a friend?

51:22.662 --> 51:24.330
Yeah, me, too.

51:27.626 --> 51:28.834
Hey.

51:37.636 --> 51:38.803
Wow.

51:39.513 --> 51:42.348
- She's a beauty, ain't she?
- Yeah.

51:42.432 --> 51:44.475
What kind of gun is this?

51:44.559 --> 51:46.685
That's a tranquillizer gun.

51:46.770 --> 51:50.106
If any of these little fuckers
decide to freak out on the kids,

51:50.190 --> 51:52.233
I get to take them down.

51:52.859 --> 51:54.902
Ain't that right, mother? What?

51:54.986 --> 51:57.071
That's what I thought. Shut up.

51:57.864 --> 52:00.282
Hey, be careful with that.

52:00.367 --> 52:02.868
That's the most powerful tranq gun
on the market.

52:02.953 --> 52:04.328
Got her in Mexico.

52:04.412 --> 52:06.288
- Cool.
- Yeah, it is cool.

52:06.373 --> 52:09.500
They say it could puncture
the skin of a rhino from a...

52:12.295 --> 52:13.587
Oh!

52:17.384 --> 52:18.425
Yes!

52:19.010 --> 52:20.678
That's awesome.

52:21.304 --> 52:22.471
What?

52:22.848 --> 52:25.432
You just took one in the jugular, man!

52:27.644 --> 52:29.061
Whoa.

52:29.146 --> 52:30.229
Yes!

52:31.815 --> 52:33.566
Oh, my God.

52:34.651 --> 52:37.069
Oh, my God, I did. Is this bad?

52:37.737 --> 52:38.863
Is this bad?

52:38.947 --> 52:41.657
Pull that out. That shit is not cool.

52:44.870 --> 52:48.581
Wait. Wait. Pull what out?

52:48.665 --> 52:52.168
The dart, man.
You got a fucking dart in your neck.

52:55.714 --> 52:57.756
You're... You're crazy, man.

52:58.800 --> 53:00.718
You're crazy.

53:00.802 --> 53:02.344
I like you.

53:02.929 --> 53:04.597
But you're crazy.

53:06.099 --> 53:07.600
I feel tired.

53:08.101 --> 53:10.853
Look who's coming.
The spaceman's coming.

53:15.108 --> 53:18.903
Happy birthday to you

53:24.284 --> 53:28.621
Happy birthday dear...

53:31.249 --> 53:35.794
Help me, Mommy!

54:16.836 --> 54:19.838
This is the most beautiful day.

54:20.882 --> 54:22.091
Yes.

54:23.009 --> 54:24.843
It really is.

54:32.269 --> 54:34.270
I've missed you, Frank.

54:34.354 --> 54:36.605
I'm so glad you're back.

54:37.357 --> 54:39.566
I've missed you, too, honey.

54:40.735 --> 54:42.528
You look gorgeous.

54:44.239 --> 54:45.656
You're sweet.

54:57.460 --> 54:59.962
He just French kissed me!

55:01.006 --> 55:02.381
Shit!

55:05.385 --> 55:06.510
This better work.

55:06.594 --> 55:08.429
The board members
are beginning to ask questions

55:08.513 --> 55:10.931
about this "civilian fraternity."

55:11.016 --> 55:13.183
Don't worry, it'll work.

55:14.311 --> 55:18.147
Here she comes.
Her name is Megan Huang.

55:18.231 --> 55:19.565
She's student council president,

55:19.649 --> 55:23.152
prelaw, star of the tennis team,
a very promising young woman.

55:23.236 --> 55:25.654
A young woman with a lot to lose.

55:25.739 --> 55:27.698
- Megan, hello.
- Hi.

55:27.782 --> 55:29.241
Have a seat.

55:35.707 --> 55:37.583
I'm sure you know Dean Pritchard.

55:37.667 --> 55:39.043
Don't turn around.

55:42.380 --> 55:45.758
Megan,
this little fraternity over on Brooke Street

55:45.842 --> 55:49.595
has become quite an inconvenience
for us, okay?

55:49.679 --> 55:54.350
And as student body president,
you approved their temporary status.

55:54.434 --> 55:58.020
Unfortunately,
you alone have the ability to revoke it.

55:58.104 --> 56:00.689
So we're gonna need you to go ahead
and do that.

56:00.774 --> 56:03.901
Revoke it? Why?
Everybody loves those guys.

56:03.985 --> 56:07.946
They throw the sickest parties.
I met my boyfriend at their casino night.

56:09.115 --> 56:10.199
That's great.

56:10.283 --> 56:13.702
It says here you are applying
to Columbia Law School.

56:13.787 --> 56:16.538
Wow, that's a tough school to get into.

56:16.623 --> 56:21.251
You know, Dean Pritchard has
some serious connections at Columbia.

56:21.336 --> 56:23.003
Are you bribing me?

56:23.088 --> 56:24.296
Hey.

56:25.965 --> 56:28.175
Don't make life harder on yourself,
Chang.

56:28.259 --> 56:29.635
It's Huang.

56:30.720 --> 56:33.263
Whatever.
How's the tennis season going?

56:34.182 --> 56:37.810
I made some minor changes,
but overall, it's okay.

56:37.894 --> 56:40.604
- It's a pretty standard lease.
- Great.

56:40.688 --> 56:44.733
Thank you for taking a look at it for me.
This stuff always confuses me.

56:44.818 --> 56:46.402
Anytime.

56:46.486 --> 56:49.947
So you and Mark
are moving in together?

56:50.490 --> 56:54.493
Yeah.
Well, financially it makes sense, so...

56:55.161 --> 57:02.167
You know, there's something
I think you should know about Mark.

57:02.877 --> 57:04.253
What is it?

57:04.504 --> 57:05.671
Well...

57:09.801 --> 57:12.261
Relationships are a lot of work.

57:12.345 --> 57:15.264
And, I guess what I'm saying is...

57:20.395 --> 57:21.770
Good luck.

57:22.605 --> 57:24.982
Oh. Okay. Well, thank you.

57:25.483 --> 57:27.609
Yeah. Listen,

57:27.694 --> 57:32.197
I was thinking maybe sometime we
could get some dinner or something.

57:32.323 --> 57:33.740
- Yeah.
- If that's okay with you.

57:33.825 --> 57:35.826
- I'd like that.
- Yeah.

57:35.910 --> 57:38.620
Of course, leave it to me to wait

57:38.705 --> 57:41.999
until you've got a boyfriend
to finally ask you out.

57:42.083 --> 57:44.501
- Timing was never your thing.
- No.

57:47.547 --> 57:49.882
- Okay, so thank you.
- Yeah.

57:51.217 --> 57:54.178
- And call me about dinner.
- I will.

57:54.262 --> 57:56.305
Excuse me, sir!

57:56.389 --> 57:57.681
We have a situation, sir!

57:57.765 --> 58:00.309
What are you guys doing here?
I said never at work.

58:00.393 --> 58:01.727
But it's an emergency.

58:01.811 --> 58:04.062
We can only buy K-Y Jelly
in the 4-ounce tubes.

58:04.147 --> 58:06.982
Industrial size cans will take up to
three to four business days,

58:07.066 --> 58:08.984
so we're screwed.

58:09.068 --> 58:10.319
What's all that for?

58:10.403 --> 58:12.237
It's Blue's birthday.
We're having a K-Y wrestling match.

58:12.322 --> 58:15.657
You know what?
Can we talk about this later, please?

58:19.996 --> 58:23.040
I'm born again, baby!

58:31.424 --> 58:34.176
Yeah! Yeah!

58:34.469 --> 58:37.679
This doesn't seem fair! I'm on a roll!

58:48.942 --> 58:52.736
Rip his head off!

59:05.250 --> 59:06.917
I like your room.

59:07.293 --> 59:08.293
Thanks a lot.

59:08.378 --> 59:10.879
It's kind of a home
away from home for me.

59:10.964 --> 59:13.215
All the posters are mine.

59:13.299 --> 59:16.468
I don't usually like fraternity guys.
They're such losers.

59:16.553 --> 59:20.514
But you're, like, mature.

59:21.474 --> 59:22.558
Mature?

59:22.642 --> 59:23.934
Yeah.

59:24.018 --> 59:27.437
So where do you sleep, anyway?

59:27.522 --> 59:30.232
Usually, I sleep at home.

59:30.316 --> 59:32.859
Sometimes I do crash here.

59:32.944 --> 59:35.696
This is a futon, actually.
It pulls out, you know.

59:35.780 --> 59:37.406
Boy, I didn't realize.

59:38.366 --> 59:40.075
Can I see it?

59:40.660 --> 59:43.161
- The futon?
- Yeah.

59:46.666 --> 59:48.000
Wow.

59:50.628 --> 59:52.504
Amy, I'm sorry.

59:53.006 --> 59:56.425
I'm married. And I can't do this.

59:56.509 --> 01:00:00.804
- I don't want this to get weird, but...
- Right. I see.

01:00:01.681 --> 01:00:04.308
But why don't you
leave me your number?

01:00:04.392 --> 01:00:07.853
This way, if something happens
to my wife, I can give you a call.

01:00:07.937 --> 01:00:10.772
- I don't think so.
- Okay, that was a bad idea.

01:00:12.984 --> 01:00:16.695
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to tonight's main event!

01:00:18.948 --> 01:00:20.365
Yeah!

01:00:22.035 --> 01:00:25.078
In this corner,
weighing in at 110 pounds,

01:00:25.163 --> 01:00:28.123
and pushing 89 years of age,

01:00:28.207 --> 01:00:31.293
the recent recipient
of a brand-new plastic hip,

01:00:31.377 --> 01:00:33.712
Joseph "Blue" Palasky!

01:00:38.051 --> 01:00:42.638
And in the opposite corner,
with a combined weight of 210 pounds,

01:00:42.722 --> 01:00:45.349
hailing from Hayden dormitory,

01:00:45.433 --> 01:00:47.684
Jenny and Jeanie!

01:00:53.441 --> 01:00:56.193
Fighters, are you ready?

01:00:57.570 --> 01:01:00.864
Hey, Blue,
you sure you're okay with this?

01:01:00.948 --> 01:01:03.492
Just ring the fucking bell, you pansy.

01:01:04.661 --> 01:01:06.244
Let's get it on!

01:01:11.709 --> 01:01:15.170
- Come on.
- Come on, grandpa, let's go.

01:01:15.254 --> 01:01:17.172
Let's go, birthday boy!

01:01:17.256 --> 01:01:19.508
What's the matter, you scared?

01:01:20.093 --> 01:01:21.301
Hello?

01:01:37.151 --> 01:01:41.321
I close my eyes

01:01:42.573 --> 01:01:46.535
Only for a moment
and the moment's gone

01:01:47.620 --> 01:01:51.540
All my dreams

01:01:52.667 --> 01:01:56.628
Pass before my eyes in curiosity

01:01:58.214 --> 01:02:00.632
Dust in the wind

01:02:00.717 --> 01:02:04.511
Looks like we better put
the K-Y wrestling on hold for a while.

01:02:04.595 --> 01:02:06.638
Good idea.

01:02:06.723 --> 01:02:10.726
Please don't beat yourself up
over this thing. It's not your fault.

01:02:10.810 --> 01:02:12.978
Damn it, Blue was old.

01:02:13.146 --> 01:02:15.731
That's what old people do. They die.

01:02:16.441 --> 01:02:17.899
I'm sorry.

01:02:18.192 --> 01:02:24.823
All we are is dust in the wind

01:02:31.456 --> 01:02:33.123
You're my boy, Blue!

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.709
You're my boy.

01:02:39.380 --> 01:02:41.798
It's been a weird month, huh?

01:02:41.883 --> 01:02:43.425
Yeah.

01:02:44.886 --> 01:02:48.638
Listen, I'm sorry
I didn't call you on your birthday.

01:02:48.723 --> 01:02:50.640
My birthday, what do you mean?

01:02:50.725 --> 01:02:52.309
Yeah, last Thursday.

01:02:53.603 --> 01:02:56.521
You forgot your birthday, didn't you,
Frank?

01:02:56.606 --> 01:02:58.565
I'm such an idiot.

01:03:00.151 --> 01:03:04.571
- What have you been doing?
- I've been keeping busy.

01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:10.410
I... Tried to join a new gym.

01:03:11.204 --> 01:03:13.038
That was one thing.

01:03:13.664 --> 01:03:17.501
And there's other stuff.
I can't remember, but keeping busy.

01:03:17.585 --> 01:03:21.463
You know, I've missed you. You know?

01:03:21.547 --> 01:03:23.089
I want you to know that.

01:03:23.174 --> 01:03:26.843
I was even thinking maybe tonight we
could get together back at home, and...

01:03:26.928 --> 01:03:29.638
I don't know,
maybe put on the Sisqó CD...

01:03:29.722 --> 01:03:32.849
I don't think that's such a good idea.

01:03:32.934 --> 01:03:34.810
Really? You don't?

01:03:35.436 --> 01:03:36.895
I don't know.

01:03:37.897 --> 01:03:40.524
Maybe we rushed into this, you know?

01:03:41.359 --> 01:03:45.153
I mean, it just doesn't feel right,
does it?

01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:48.740
Being married?

01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:52.452
What do you mean?

01:03:53.579 --> 01:03:56.414
I mean, I think we should get a divorce.

01:03:58.334 --> 01:04:00.210
Like a real divorce?

01:04:01.295 --> 01:04:02.587
Yeah.

01:04:03.130 --> 01:04:04.422
Gotcha.

01:04:06.008 --> 01:04:07.801
Okay, well...

01:04:09.679 --> 01:04:13.265
- I'm sorry.
- No. Actually, I got to run.

01:04:15.101 --> 01:04:18.395
But if I don't talk to you,

01:04:18.479 --> 01:04:21.106
keep on, keep trucking, you know?

01:04:24.110 --> 01:04:25.986
Okay, good stuff.

01:04:37.832 --> 01:04:40.041
Well, what do you think?

01:04:40.585 --> 01:04:42.502
Yeah, it's okay.

01:04:42.587 --> 01:04:44.379
- Just okay?
- Yeah.

01:04:45.756 --> 01:04:49.885
I had Mitch look at the lease.
He thinks it sounds like a good deal.

01:04:49.969 --> 01:04:52.596
You had Mitch look at the lease?
When?

01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:55.098
Last week, I stopped by his office.

01:04:55.182 --> 01:04:57.309
- Oh, God.
- What?

01:04:58.269 --> 01:05:00.395
I don't know.

01:05:00.479 --> 01:05:02.439
I'm not so sure about that guy.

01:05:02.523 --> 01:05:04.649
Mitch? Why? He's so sweet.

01:05:05.651 --> 01:05:08.862
Something I saw last week,
at the birthday party.

01:05:08.946 --> 01:05:12.991
- What did you see?
- I didn't want to get into this, but...

01:05:13.659 --> 01:05:17.621
I walked in on him, and he was
harassing one of the caterers.

01:05:17.705 --> 01:05:19.164
A young girl.

01:05:19.498 --> 01:05:21.082
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:05:21.167 --> 01:05:24.753
He was being aggressive
and grabbing her. It was disgusting.

01:05:25.713 --> 01:05:27.881
I know he's your friend.

01:05:28.507 --> 01:05:30.717
- Hello?
- Hey, it's Mitch.

01:05:30.801 --> 01:05:32.177
Hi, Mitch.

01:05:32.261 --> 01:05:35.597
I was thinking, if you're not too busy,

01:05:35.723 --> 01:05:37.349
maybe I'd take you up
on that cup of coffee.

01:05:38.684 --> 01:05:41.186
- Now's not really a good time.
- Look.

01:05:41.896 --> 01:05:46.274
I'm really sorry about the other day.
I want the chance to explain everything.

01:05:46.651 --> 01:05:49.027
- I don't think so.
- It's...

01:05:49.612 --> 01:05:54.240
It's been kind of a tough day,
and it'd really mean a lot.

01:05:58.245 --> 01:06:00.914
Listen, there are a few things
I wanted to clear up

01:06:00.998 --> 01:06:05.627
because I get the feeling you have
an entirely distorted view of who I am.

01:06:05.711 --> 01:06:08.296
Really?
What would ever give you that idea?

01:06:08.381 --> 01:06:11.216
Okay,
that's one pecan pie and two coffees.

01:06:11.384 --> 01:06:12.592
And don't worry.

01:06:12.677 --> 01:06:15.595
For the Godfather,
it's always on the house.

01:06:15.930 --> 01:06:18.598
- Not here.
- I know who you are. I am Avi.

01:06:18.683 --> 01:06:20.225
I'm a big supporter
of what you guys are doing.

01:06:20.309 --> 01:06:21.434
Thank you.

01:06:21.519 --> 01:06:24.854
You are beautiful. No offense, though.
He is the king.

01:06:24.939 --> 01:06:27.399
You are taking coffee and pie
with a living legend.

01:06:27.483 --> 01:06:29.943
That's very kind, but I insist, I'll pay.

01:06:30.027 --> 01:06:32.153
- Your money, it's not good here.
- Okay.

01:06:32.238 --> 01:06:34.656
I look forward
to pledging next semester.

01:06:36.033 --> 01:06:40.036
Okay, now don't you think
this is going a little far?

01:06:40.121 --> 01:06:43.164
I heard one of your pledges died.
Is that true?

01:06:43.708 --> 01:06:46.334
Well, yes. But he was really old.

01:06:46.419 --> 01:06:49.254
And I feel pretty confident
that when we get the autopsy back,

01:06:49.338 --> 01:06:51.673
it'll show that it was
probably of natural causes.

01:06:51.757 --> 01:06:56.219
Look, to be honest, you're really not
the person I thought you were.

01:06:56.303 --> 01:07:00.765
- But it's okay. It's not a big deal.
- I think that I am that person.

01:07:00.850 --> 01:07:05.020
And I feel more like myself now
than I have in a really long time.

01:07:05.104 --> 01:07:07.856
So, that's why you go around
harassing young women?

01:07:07.940 --> 01:07:09.691
- Doing what?
- The caterer.

01:07:09.775 --> 01:07:12.902
At the birthday party.
Mark told me about her.

01:07:12.987 --> 01:07:16.156
Wait a second.
I didn't want to say anything,

01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:19.659
but Mark is the one who
was acting inappropriate.

01:07:19.744 --> 01:07:21.661
- You are unbelievable.
- It's true.

01:07:21.746 --> 01:07:23.663
Hey, look who it is.

01:07:23.748 --> 01:07:25.123
Hey, Mitch.

01:07:25.833 --> 01:07:26.875
Darcie, hey.

01:07:26.959 --> 01:07:29.711
Hi. I've been meaning to call you.

01:07:29.795 --> 01:07:32.172
I just didn't want you to worry
about my dad.

01:07:32.256 --> 01:07:35.550
He doesn't know anything,
so it's totally cool.

01:07:35.634 --> 01:07:37.510
- Her dad?
- Yeah.

01:07:37.595 --> 01:07:43.850
Yeah. You know, it's nothing, really.
I mean, they actually work together.

01:07:45.102 --> 01:07:47.562
We gotta run, 'cause we got this
prom committee thing,

01:07:47.646 --> 01:07:49.814
so I'll see you around.

01:07:49.899 --> 01:07:52.025
- Sorry.
- Bye.

01:07:53.319 --> 01:07:55.236
Prom committee thing?

01:07:55.821 --> 01:07:57.822
That I actually can explain.

01:07:57.907 --> 01:07:59.866
Right, I'm sure you can.

01:08:00.576 --> 01:08:02.494
- I have to go.
- Please wait a second.

01:08:02.578 --> 01:08:05.371
No, really. I have to go.

01:08:10.211 --> 01:08:12.587
Hey. Chicks.

01:08:12.671 --> 01:08:14.798
Don't worry for her.

01:08:14.882 --> 01:08:17.341
Love, it's a motherfucker, huh?

01:08:26.102 --> 01:08:28.269
Holy shit!

01:08:49.792 --> 01:08:53.461
Dear Mitch, if you're holding this letter,
you already know.

01:08:53.546 --> 01:08:58.049
The house has been boarded up.
The windows, the doors, everything.

01:08:58.134 --> 01:09:00.885
We're at the Comfort Inn, room 112.

01:09:00.970 --> 01:09:02.761
I love you. Frank.

01:09:03.264 --> 01:09:05.014
Due to these infractions,

01:09:05.099 --> 01:09:07.517
not only will your house
be repossessed,

01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:10.812
but those of you who are students
will be expelled from the university

01:09:10.895 --> 01:09:14.399
for your participation
in a non-sanctioned fraternity.

01:09:14.483 --> 01:09:17.944
Please take a moment
to allow this information to sink in.

01:09:22.658 --> 01:09:25.827
Good. Believe me,

01:09:25.911 --> 01:09:31.582
the actions taken by the student council
have come as a great shock to me.

01:09:31.667 --> 01:09:34.002
But unfortunately,
there's nothing I can do about it.

01:09:34.086 --> 01:09:37.964
Thank you for your time.
Good luck, and God bless America.

01:09:43.595 --> 01:09:45.430
He can't do that.

01:09:45.514 --> 01:09:47.515
This guy's playing hardball.

01:09:48.475 --> 01:09:51.227
I got to say,
I'm kind of impressed by him.

01:09:51.312 --> 01:09:52.854
Well, we're expelled.

01:09:52.938 --> 01:09:55.440
My life is over and I'm gonna wind up
working at Red Lobster.

01:09:55.524 --> 01:09:59.068
- You already work in Red Lobster.
- Yeah, but it's part time, Dick.

01:09:59.153 --> 01:10:01.571
- Guys.
- Hey, listen.

01:10:02.114 --> 01:10:06.534
This is a serious situation.
I mean, I'm kicked out of school.

01:10:07.995 --> 01:10:10.413
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
My mom's gonna kill me.

01:10:10.497 --> 01:10:12.498
Come on, she's not gonna kill you.

01:10:12.583 --> 01:10:13.875
Yes, she is.

01:10:13.959 --> 01:10:16.586
I'm the first one
to go to college in my family.

01:10:16.670 --> 01:10:20.715
When I left, she said,
"Weensie, screw this up, I'll kill you."

01:10:21.884 --> 01:10:23.843
She showed me the knife.

01:10:27.723 --> 01:10:29.140
Mitch is a lawyer, buddy.

01:10:29.225 --> 01:10:32.060
He's gonna take care
of this thing, okay?

01:10:32.144 --> 01:10:33.811
It's gonna be all right.

01:10:36.815 --> 01:10:38.733
He was supposed to be Luke Skywalker.

01:10:38.817 --> 01:10:41.444
Guys, still want to be in the fraternity?

01:10:43.822 --> 01:10:47.033
We've been waiting all semester
for you to ask us that.

01:10:47.117 --> 01:10:48.993
Good. I need your help with something.

01:10:49.078 --> 01:10:51.704
Off the record. You do this, you're in.

01:10:51.789 --> 01:10:53.248
Sir, yes, sir.

01:10:53.332 --> 01:10:56.918
Okay. Walsh, I need you to track down
a copy of University Code 7-A,

01:10:57.002 --> 01:10:59.087
- then fax it to this number immediately.
- Got it.

01:10:59.171 --> 01:11:01.464
- I need to talk to you.
- Give me five minutes.

01:11:01.548 --> 01:11:04.550
Booker, make two copies
of this petition, have it notarized,

01:11:04.635 --> 01:11:07.053
and then messenger it over
to 34 Langley, and then...

01:11:07.137 --> 01:11:10.598
Listen, Donald tells me you got these
guys working prep for the arbitration.

01:11:10.683 --> 01:11:13.935
I told you five times, I want them
working the Sunshine Square deal.

01:11:14.019 --> 01:11:16.688
Well, I locked
the Sunshine Square deal yesterday,

01:11:16.772 --> 01:11:18.815
so now I have them
helping with the arbitration,

01:11:18.899 --> 01:11:21.484
and I'd appreciate it
if you let me handle my own team

01:11:21.568 --> 01:11:24.988
and don't get on my ass
every time I'm trying to do something.

01:11:26.365 --> 01:11:27.740
All right.

01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:31.327
- Wanna make sure you're on top of it.
- Well, I am.

01:11:31.412 --> 01:11:33.371
Well, good. Carry on.

01:11:33.956 --> 01:11:37.083
See?
That's why they call him the Godfather.

01:11:37.167 --> 01:11:38.334
Hey.

01:11:39.044 --> 01:11:41.087
Just take care of it.

01:11:43.799 --> 01:11:48.303
Gentlemen, got some good news
and I got some bad news.

01:11:48.387 --> 01:11:49.887
Did a little research.

01:11:49.972 --> 01:11:53.474
What Pritchard did, technically,
is illegal.

01:11:53.559 --> 01:11:55.518
We have the right to a formal evaluation

01:11:55.602 --> 01:11:58.146
before they can deny
our official application.

01:11:58.230 --> 01:12:01.983
However, we're now subject
to a charter certification review

01:12:02.067 --> 01:12:03.651
given by the board of trustees.

01:12:03.736 --> 01:12:05.653
Damn it.

01:12:05.738 --> 01:12:08.823
Wait.
Wait, what does that mean exactly?

01:12:08.907 --> 01:12:12.660
According to university bylaws, it's a
thorough inspection of the fraternity,

01:12:12.745 --> 01:12:14.912
and our contribution to the community.

01:12:14.997 --> 01:12:16.998
Focuses on five categories:

01:12:17.082 --> 01:12:20.501
Academics, athletics,
community service,

01:12:20.586 --> 01:12:23.838
debate, and school spirit.

01:12:23.922 --> 01:12:26.924
Good luck to everybody.
It was nice to know you all.

01:12:27.009 --> 01:12:28.426
And I'll see you around campus.

01:12:28.510 --> 01:12:31.512
Actually, all of us are being tested.
Yeah.

01:12:31.597 --> 01:12:34.640
What are you talking about?
I'm not even in school.

01:12:34.725 --> 01:12:35.767
It's in the bylaws.

01:12:35.851 --> 01:12:38.144
Every member of the fraternity
is subject to review

01:12:38.228 --> 01:12:41.147
in every category, including academics.

01:12:41.231 --> 01:12:43.775
Mitch, can you come here a second?
I don't mind popping for breakfast.

01:12:43.859 --> 01:12:46.235
I do speakers. I don't do tests.

01:12:47.237 --> 01:12:48.571
This is unbelievable.

01:12:48.655 --> 01:12:51.240
What happened to "needing
brotherhood now more than ever"?

01:12:51.325 --> 01:12:52.367
They need us.

01:12:52.451 --> 01:12:54.577
Come on, college is overrated anyway.

01:12:54.661 --> 01:12:58.122
I built Speaker City from the ground up.
I can barely read. Truth.

01:12:58.207 --> 01:13:01.959
This damn thing was your idea,
and you convinced me to do it,

01:13:02.044 --> 01:13:04.253
and now people's lives are ruined.

01:13:04.338 --> 01:13:06.798
Ruined? Like whose life is ruined?

01:13:06.882 --> 01:13:08.383
Well, let's see.

01:13:09.134 --> 01:13:12.553
Blue's dead, Frank's divorced,

01:13:12.638 --> 01:13:16.724
I've lost my house,
Nicole thinks I'm a total jackass.

01:13:16.809 --> 01:13:20.895
And now we got nine kids who are
gonna get expelled from school,

01:13:20.979 --> 01:13:23.314
and you're not even
gonna help them out.

01:13:36.787 --> 01:13:41.124
Is this thing gonna go down smooth?
I'm missing 18 holes of golf here.

01:13:41.208 --> 01:13:43.960
One hundred percent.
I got creative with some of their tests.

01:13:44.044 --> 01:13:45.878
It should make
for a very entertaining day.

01:13:45.963 --> 01:13:48.256
I'm going to enjoy
kicking these assholes off campus.

01:13:48.340 --> 01:13:49.382
Ditto.

01:13:51.218 --> 01:13:55.179
Welcome, everyone, to the official
debate section of the charter review.

01:13:57.266 --> 01:14:00.768
Unfortunately, the captain
of the university debate team

01:14:00.853 --> 01:14:03.062
had a scheduling conflict. Yeah.

01:14:03.147 --> 01:14:06.732
So we had to bring someone else in
to fill in for this event.

01:14:07.526 --> 01:14:12.780
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome
the co-host of CNN's Crossfire,

01:14:12.865 --> 01:14:17.618
famed political consultant,
the "Raging Cajun," Mr. James Carville.

01:14:22.583 --> 01:14:24.125
- Thank you.
- Don't clap.

01:14:24.209 --> 01:14:27.128
Thank you, Dean Pritchard.
It's an honor and pleasure to be here.

01:14:27.212 --> 01:14:29.505
Topic number one.

01:14:31.467 --> 01:14:34.302
What is your position
on the role of government

01:14:34.386 --> 01:14:38.139
in supporting innovation
in the field of biotechnology?

01:14:39.391 --> 01:14:41.642
Well, Dean,
I'm glad you asked that question...

01:14:41.727 --> 01:14:45.730
I'd like to jump in and take that one,
Jimmy, if you don't mind.

01:14:46.356 --> 01:14:48.024
Have at it, hoss.

01:14:48.525 --> 01:14:50.735
Why doesn't he wait for an easy one?

01:14:51.778 --> 01:14:53.196
Frank, no...

01:14:57.659 --> 01:14:59.952
Recent research has shown
the empirical evidence

01:15:00.037 --> 01:15:02.997
for globalization of corporate
innovation is very limited.

01:15:03.081 --> 01:15:06.250
And as a corollary,
the market for technologies is shrinking.

01:15:06.335 --> 01:15:08.002
As a world leader,
it is important for America

01:15:08.086 --> 01:15:10.963
to provide systematic research grants
for our scientists.

01:15:11.048 --> 01:15:12.840
I believe
there will always be a need for us

01:15:12.925 --> 01:15:14.717
to have a well-articulated
innovation policy

01:15:14.801 --> 01:15:17.887
with emphasis on human resource
development. Thank you.

01:15:22.601 --> 01:15:26.103
- Where'd that come from?
- What happened? I blacked out.

01:15:26.188 --> 01:15:28.648
- It was awesome.
- That was interesting.

01:15:28.941 --> 01:15:32.985
Thank you very much.
And, your rebuttal, Mr. Carville?

01:15:35.239 --> 01:15:37.740
We have no response.

01:15:37.991 --> 01:15:39.617
That was perfect.

01:15:42.871 --> 01:15:46.040
That's the way you do it!
That's the way you debate.

01:15:56.385 --> 01:15:58.219
Number 12.

01:15:58.762 --> 01:16:03.391
Which of the following is a
generally accepted graphical technique

01:16:03.475 --> 01:16:06.769
for determining
first order system parameters?

01:16:07.646 --> 01:16:12.483
Is it, A,
Harriot's method of solving cubics?

01:16:12.568 --> 01:16:15.403
B, Pythagorean triplets?

01:16:15.487 --> 01:16:19.740
Or C, the migration method
of graphing quadratic functions?

01:16:22.286 --> 01:16:24.161
Harriot's method of solving cubics.

01:16:24.246 --> 01:16:27.206
The answer is A,
Harriot's method of solving cubics.

01:16:34.172 --> 01:16:35.756
Good test.

01:16:44.850 --> 01:16:47.018
All right, Frank. Let's do this.

01:16:47.936 --> 01:16:49.020
Go, Harrison!

01:17:28.810 --> 01:17:30.728
- Yes!
- Wow.

01:17:38.737 --> 01:17:40.655
Let's go, Cougars!

01:17:44.743 --> 01:17:47.620
Oh, no!

01:17:48.580 --> 01:17:51.123
Help me! Help me!

01:17:54.795 --> 01:17:56.629
Dean Pritchard,
can I talk to you for a second?

01:17:56.713 --> 01:17:58.839
Megan, I'm a little busy.

01:17:58.924 --> 01:18:01.133
I didn't get into Columbia Law School.

01:18:01.218 --> 01:18:02.802
How awful.

01:18:02.886 --> 01:18:06.055
You said if I revoked their charter,
you'd get me into Columbia.

01:18:06.139 --> 01:18:07.139
I did say that.

01:18:07.224 --> 01:18:09.225
No one at Columbia
has even heard of you.

01:18:09.309 --> 01:18:11.060
Oh, Megan.

01:18:11.144 --> 01:18:14.146
Look, I did my part.
Now you have to do yours.

01:18:14.231 --> 01:18:16.524
- That's how bribes work.
- I know how bribes work.

01:18:16.608 --> 01:18:18.275
I bribe people all the time,
but I changed my mind.

01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:20.861
It's a free country. Lesson learned.

01:18:25.242 --> 01:18:26.617
Damn it!

01:18:27.703 --> 01:18:30.746
Sorry, guys,
I lost my composure out there.

01:18:30.831 --> 01:18:33.457
- I'm an idiot.
- Don't worry.

01:18:33.542 --> 01:18:37.420
We'll make those points up.
Your skin's gonna grow back, too.

01:18:37.504 --> 01:18:39.213
I'm sorry.

01:18:39.297 --> 01:18:41.132
How many events
do we actually have left here?

01:18:41.216 --> 01:18:44.719
One.
Frank's accident definitely set us back.

01:18:44.803 --> 01:18:48.806
But if we pass...
If we pass athletics, we're in.

01:18:48.890 --> 01:18:51.726
All right, everybody!
That's what I'm talking about.

01:18:51.810 --> 01:18:54.228
We've made a great effort so far.
Let's just keep it up!

01:18:54.312 --> 01:18:55.396
That's right!

01:18:55.480 --> 01:18:58.149
We can't have anyone
freak out out there, okay?

01:18:58.233 --> 01:19:01.527
We've got to keep our composure!
We've come too far.

01:19:01.611 --> 01:19:05.072
There's too much to lose!
We've got to just keep our composure!

01:19:05.157 --> 01:19:06.282
For your final test,

01:19:06.366 --> 01:19:09.660
I've chosen the men's gymnastics
team's all-around competition.

01:19:09.745 --> 01:19:11.328
And participants in the three events

01:19:11.413 --> 01:19:14.248
will be chosen at random by me,
right now.

01:19:14.332 --> 01:19:16.500
Let's see, rings.

01:19:18.128 --> 01:19:19.795
Bernard. Okay, great.

01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:23.048
Floor exercise. How about Frank?

01:19:23.133 --> 01:19:24.216
Great.

01:19:24.301 --> 01:19:29.013
And for the vault competition,
I don't know...

01:19:29.347 --> 01:19:31.015
How about...

01:19:32.934 --> 01:19:34.518
- You.
- Me?

01:19:34.603 --> 01:19:37.104
Yeah. Is there a problem with that?

01:20:18.230 --> 01:20:20.022
I'm still holding.

01:20:21.024 --> 01:20:22.274
Still holding!

01:20:27.072 --> 01:20:31.617
- It's physically impossible.
- Don't worry. Abdul is there to spot you.

01:20:36.081 --> 01:20:37.790
We're waiting, gentlemen.

01:20:37.874 --> 01:20:40.876
Just hit the board as hard as you can
and shut your eyes.

01:20:40.961 --> 01:20:42.795
- You ready?
- Have fun with it.

01:20:42.879 --> 01:20:45.422
Go! Come on!

01:20:52.013 --> 01:20:53.389
Come on!

01:21:05.735 --> 01:21:07.027
Yeah!

01:21:07.112 --> 01:21:09.780
Oh, my God! Yes!

01:21:26.131 --> 01:21:29.091
Congratulations, gentlemen.
You put forth quite an effort.

01:21:29.175 --> 01:21:30.718
You really did.

01:21:30.802 --> 01:21:33.804
But I'm afraid I have
some bad news for you.

01:21:33.889 --> 01:21:35.806
You didn't pass your review.

01:21:37.100 --> 01:21:40.603
What are you talking about?
We finished with an 84%.

01:21:40.687 --> 01:21:43.355
Yes, you people did finish with an 84%,

01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:47.735
but unfortunately, another pledge of
yours scored a zero in every category.

01:21:47.819 --> 01:21:52.406
- What pledge?
- A Joseph "Blue" Palasky.

01:21:55.118 --> 01:21:59.246
Hey, man, Blue's dead.
He passed away two weeks ago.

01:21:59.331 --> 01:22:02.166
He's listed right here
on your official chapter roster,

01:22:02.250 --> 01:22:05.586
and those zeroes drop your average
to a 58%.

01:22:05.670 --> 01:22:08.172
Come on, you got to be kidding me.

01:22:08.757 --> 01:22:10.674
It's been quite a journey.

01:22:11.718 --> 01:22:14.178
You're gonna be all right, Frank.

01:22:14.846 --> 01:22:17.932
- Come on, now, big cat.
- I have no reason to live.

01:22:18.016 --> 01:22:20.267
We're gonna find you
a one-bedroom apartment,

01:22:20.352 --> 01:22:23.020
get you back on your feet,
maybe move you in over at Beanie's...

01:22:23.104 --> 01:22:24.855
It's not gonna be the same.

01:22:24.940 --> 01:22:27.775
Didn't quite work out for you fellows,
did it?

01:22:27.859 --> 01:22:32.279
I recommend you drive off immediately,
before something bad happens.

01:22:33.239 --> 01:22:35.950
- I'm scared.
- Excuse me, Mitch? Am I interrupting?

01:22:36.034 --> 01:22:39.244
Megan, you are. If you could leave,
it would be tremendous for all of us.

01:22:39.329 --> 01:22:42.122
I thought you guys
might find this interesting.

01:22:42.207 --> 01:22:45.459
You said if I revoked their charter,
you'd get me into Columbia.

01:22:45.543 --> 01:22:46.710
I did say that.

01:22:46.795 --> 01:22:49.713
Look, I did my part.
Now you have to do yours.

01:22:49.839 --> 01:22:52.466
- That's how bribes work.
- I know how bribes work...

01:22:52.550 --> 01:22:54.551
You know what? Just, let me...

01:22:55.887 --> 01:22:57.763
Bird-dog him, Frankie!

01:23:00.392 --> 01:23:01.809
Coming through!

01:23:03.061 --> 01:23:05.604
- Go that way!
- Slow down, man!

01:23:10.068 --> 01:23:12.695
Pritchard, hey, it's over.

01:23:13.279 --> 01:23:17.199
Hand over the tape. It's over.
It's over, okay?

01:23:17.283 --> 01:23:18.575
You know where
the rest of the guys are?

01:23:18.660 --> 01:23:21.161
I don't know, we all spread out.

01:23:21.538 --> 01:23:23.706
What are you doing? What are you...

01:23:24.791 --> 01:23:26.625
Time out. Time out.

01:23:31.715 --> 01:23:34.049
Excuse me! Excuse me!

01:23:34.259 --> 01:23:36.635
Gentlemen... Oh, God!

01:23:44.394 --> 01:23:46.270
Wait, wait, my shoulder.

01:23:52.819 --> 01:23:54.653
This man accosted me!

01:23:54.738 --> 01:23:56.321
You are all witnesses! He accosted me!

01:23:56.406 --> 01:23:59.950
Frank!

01:24:02.287 --> 01:24:04.121
Frank, are you okay?

01:24:04.664 --> 01:24:07.916
Mitch, I'm so cold.

01:24:10.587 --> 01:24:12.337
Come on, big cat.

01:24:12.422 --> 01:24:14.506
I think I see Blue.

01:24:15.800 --> 01:24:17.384
He looks glorious.

01:24:17.469 --> 01:24:19.970
- Stay with me.
- Okay.

01:24:20.805 --> 01:24:22.389
I did good.

01:24:24.142 --> 01:24:25.684
You did great.

01:24:39.657 --> 01:24:41.533
Man, I'm telling you!

01:24:56.674 --> 01:24:57.841
Hi.

01:24:59.886 --> 01:25:02.387
Hey! Wow.

01:25:03.389 --> 01:25:05.808
- How are you?
- I'm okay.

01:25:06.101 --> 01:25:10.020
- You know, I got that apartment.
- Good for you. That's great.

01:25:10.688 --> 01:25:12.731
And you were right about Mark.

01:25:12.816 --> 01:25:14.108
What happened?

01:25:14.192 --> 01:25:18.612
Let's just say I caught him red-handed
and it wasn't pretty.

01:25:19.989 --> 01:25:22.199
I guess I thought he could change,
you know?

01:25:22.283 --> 01:25:23.492
I don't know.

01:25:25.328 --> 01:25:27.329
So you're moving out?

01:25:28.414 --> 01:25:32.960
Yeah, I'm moving into a new place,
far, far away from here.

01:25:33.545 --> 01:25:35.671
What about your little fraternity?

01:25:35.755 --> 01:25:39.133
Well, they're upgrading,
moving into a new facility.

01:25:39.217 --> 01:25:41.718
And to tell you the truth,

01:25:41.803 --> 01:25:45.639
they don't have much use
for the Godfather anymore.

01:25:45.723 --> 01:25:50.769
I hope you'll still think I'm cool
even without all this.

01:25:51.521 --> 01:25:53.313
I think I can deal with it.

01:25:53.398 --> 01:25:55.274
I appreciate it.

01:25:55.358 --> 01:25:57.693
Although, you know, I have to say,

01:25:57.777 --> 01:26:02.114
I have always been a little curious
about what goes on inside these places.

01:26:02.448 --> 01:26:04.032
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:26:06.578 --> 01:26:09.329
I do have another 12 hours on my lease.

01:26:09.414 --> 01:26:13.750
I'd be more than happy
to show you around.

01:26:13.835 --> 01:26:15.752
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:26:17.213 --> 01:26:18.755
Maybe for a minute.

01:26:19.632 --> 01:26:20.924
Great.

01:26:21.551 --> 01:26:23.177
Happy Tuesday to you out there.

01:26:23.261 --> 01:26:27.181
It's "Frank the Tank" here
at Harrison Cougar Radio, 88.6.

01:26:27.265 --> 01:26:30.058
Wanna give a shout-out
to the Godfather.

01:26:30.143 --> 01:26:33.145
If it wasn't for you,
I wouldn't be here today, Mitch.

01:26:33.229 --> 01:26:35.063
I'd probably be dead.

01:26:35.148 --> 01:26:38.066
Face down
in a drained pool somewhere.

01:26:39.068 --> 01:26:41.695
A quick note
to all you future brothers out there,

01:26:41.779 --> 01:26:43.197
brand-new house on campus,

01:26:43.281 --> 01:26:46.533
located at Dean Pritchard's
former residence.

01:26:46.618 --> 01:26:48.827
You all remember that crazy bastard.

01:26:50.163 --> 01:26:53.248
We'd love for you to join us
this Saturday at our open house

01:26:53.333 --> 01:26:57.336
for some chips, soda,
and some late-night streaking.

01:26:57.420 --> 01:26:59.922
Little right. Little more.

01:27:00.715 --> 01:27:03.300
Yeah, that's good enough.
That's good enough.

01:27:03.551 --> 01:27:05.219
- Welcome aboard, Booker.
- Thank you, sir.

01:27:05.303 --> 01:27:08.180
- Walsh. Well done.
- Frank the Tank.

01:27:08.264 --> 01:27:11.016
- Why don't you get me a fresh beer?
- You serious?

01:27:11.100 --> 01:27:12.809
Now!

01:27:12.894 --> 01:27:15.646
Now! Hurry, you sorry son of a bitch!

01:27:50.348 --> 01:27:51.598
Oh, shit.

01:28:02.777 --> 01:28:07.781
I close my eyes

01:28:07.865 --> 01:28:12.703
Only for a moment
and the moment's gone

01:28:12.787 --> 01:28:17.666
All my dreams

01:28:17.750 --> 01:28:22.713
Pass before my eyes in curiosity

01:28:22.797 --> 01:28:27.426
Dust in the wind

01:28:27.510 --> 01:28:29.052
All they are is...

01:28:30.972 --> 01:28:32.764
Stay in the goal.

01:28:32.849 --> 01:28:35.142
We gotta stay in the goal.
You can't be walking around.

01:28:35.226 --> 01:28:37.561
You're killing me.
Can we stay between the posts?

01:28:37.645 --> 01:28:41.315
I want focus, I want intensity,
and I want "1, 2, 3"!

01:28:41.399 --> 01:28:42.733
Woofers!

01:28:42.817 --> 01:28:46.570
Go, go, go, eat them up!
Hungry, hungry, hungry! Eat them up!

01:28:46.654 --> 01:28:50.574
Caleb, you know what to do in the box.
We talked about it. In the box!

01:28:50.658 --> 01:28:52.826
Chill out, we're up by six.

01:28:52.910 --> 01:28:57.539
That ref's a real prick out there.
That's right, you heard me, my man!

01:28:57.623 --> 01:29:01.335
Number four's been throwing elbows,
and someone's kid's gonna get hurt.

01:29:01.419 --> 01:29:02.669
What?

01:29:02.754 --> 01:29:04.838
Let's make it official then, jackass!

01:29:04.922 --> 01:29:06.548
Let's make it official!

01:29:07.425 --> 01:29:10.510
Get the clipboard.
I'll be in the car, all right?

01:29:10.595 --> 01:29:13.096
- Have some respect for yourself.
- Thank you.

01:29:13.264 --> 01:29:16.099
Is that Frank the Tank?

01:29:16.184 --> 01:29:18.226
Hey. Heidi.

01:29:19.354 --> 01:29:22.189
- How you doing?
- I'm doing really good.

01:29:22.273 --> 01:29:24.941
I got into body painting.

01:29:25.026 --> 01:29:27.110
- I didn't know that.
- Yeah.

01:29:27.195 --> 01:29:30.947
- That's great.
- Well, you're looking very healthy.

01:29:31.032 --> 01:29:34.368
Oh, thanks. Yeah, so are you.

01:29:34.452 --> 01:29:36.411
Oh, thank you.

01:29:36.496 --> 01:29:39.748
So I heard you and Marissa split up.
Is that true?

01:29:39.832 --> 01:29:44.294
- Yeah, we did.
- Oh! You poor baby.

01:29:45.046 --> 01:29:48.382
You know, I'm having this get-together
at my place tomorrow night.

01:29:48.466 --> 01:29:52.386
Just like a few Internet friends.
You should swing by.

01:29:52.470 --> 01:29:54.388
- Really?
- Totally.

01:29:55.223 --> 01:29:56.598
- Okay.
- All right.

01:29:56.682 --> 01:29:59.476
- That sounds awesome.
- See you tomorrow night.

01:30:02.647 --> 01:30:04.064
Awesome.

01:30:04.148 --> 01:30:05.482
Yes!

01:30:08.736 --> 01:30:10.570
I am back!

01:30:14.659 --> 01:30:16.118
You know it!
