00:50.584 --> 00:51.585
( Crickets chirping )

00:51.752 --> 00:53.561
(siren chirps)

00:57.624 --> 00:59.069
Two three to base.

00:59.226 --> 01:00.899
I need you to run
Louisiana plates.

01:01.061 --> 01:03.371
Victor, two, seven,

01:03.530 --> 01:06.636
X-ray, three, three, two.

01:13.240 --> 01:14.742
(growling )

01:14.908 --> 01:16.148
Stay right there.

01:16.310 --> 01:19.416
I said stay right there!

01:19.580 --> 01:20.581
Freeze!

01:20.747 --> 01:24.490
( Groans, screaming )

01:34.261 --> 01:36.502
( music playing )

02:32.285 --> 02:33.491
(gunshots)

02:33.654 --> 02:36.464
Your hostage search
and rescue training drill is a go.

02:36.623 --> 02:39.661
See you at 2100 hours.
Good luck.

02:42.863 --> 02:45.002
( Crickets chirping )

02:59.880 --> 03:01.188
(gunshots)

03:08.522 --> 03:10.832
- Charges set.
- Let her go.

03:10.991 --> 03:13.665
( Explosion )

03:15.696 --> 03:17.505
Man: Clear. On me.

03:43.423 --> 03:45.061
(gunshot)

03:55.736 --> 03:57.613
Man: Clear. Hallway.

04:03.710 --> 04:06.247
Man #2:
Jackal 1, jackpot, jackpot.

04:12.586 --> 04:14.623
(gunshot)

04:16.589 --> 04:17.898
Man: Bet you'll never try
to clear a room

04:18.058 --> 04:19.969
on your own again, will ya?

04:28.602 --> 04:31.981
You know, we've all messed up
when we started.

04:33.673 --> 04:35.084
You're gonna be good.

04:35.242 --> 04:36.846
Thanks.

04:37.010 --> 04:39.115
You're replacing
a damn good SEAL

04:39.279 --> 04:41.657
that everybody liked.

04:43.283 --> 04:45.092
It's not gonna be easy, AJ.

04:45.252 --> 04:47.425
What happened,

04:47.587 --> 04:50.158
if you don't mind me asking?

04:50.323 --> 04:51.859
It was a, uh...

04:52.025 --> 04:54.528
it was a snatch-and-grab op
on the Pakistan border.

04:54.694 --> 04:58.608
- We're getting overrun, boys.
- ( Gunshots )

05:01.635 --> 05:03.637
Went up to the crest
of a small mountain pass.

05:03.804 --> 05:05.977
All hell broke loose.

05:06.139 --> 05:09.313
Small arms fire, RPG rounds,
just... all over, man.

05:09.476 --> 05:11.786
I'm taking heavy fire,
do you copy?

05:11.945 --> 05:14.551
I'm pinned down.
Repeat, I'm pinned down.

05:14.714 --> 05:18.457
Bradley was covering
our flank and maneuver when...

05:18.618 --> 05:19.858
he got separated.

05:20.020 --> 05:23.524
Man on radio: Air support, sector 305.
Take cover, Bradley.

05:25.225 --> 05:27.535
By the time we realized
he was cut off...

05:30.297 --> 05:31.708
there was nothing we could do.

05:31.865 --> 05:34.368
- ( Gunshots)
- ( Grunts)

05:34.534 --> 05:36.707
- Oh, Damn it.
- We wanted to go back...

05:36.870 --> 05:38.816
(gunshot)

05:38.972 --> 05:39.973
so bad.

05:40.140 --> 05:41.414
I'm hit.

05:42.742 --> 05:45.086
Air support arrived
and it was...

05:45.245 --> 05:46.849
it was too late.

05:47.013 --> 05:48.549
Man on radio:
Where are you hit?

05:48.715 --> 05:51.559
- Stay covered, I'm on my way.
- ( Explosion)

05:53.920 --> 05:55.831
You could hear it.

05:55.989 --> 05:57.696
Jesus, man.

05:57.858 --> 06:00.702
(distant gunfire)

06:00.861 --> 06:04.035
There's nothing worse...

06:04.197 --> 06:06.939
than having to retrieve
your friend's dead body.

06:07.100 --> 06:09.011
But you know what?

06:10.770 --> 06:13.410
He died that day
for his country

06:13.573 --> 06:18.545
and so his teammates
could live to fight another day.

06:20.547 --> 06:23.187
There's no better way
to go out.

06:23.350 --> 06:24.920
You're right.

06:28.054 --> 06:29.556
Anyway,

06:29.723 --> 06:31.243
how's your old lady
handling this move?

06:34.127 --> 06:36.266
Ah. ( Chuckles )

06:36.429 --> 06:40.206
Uh, you know, she, uh...
she loves Coronado, man.

06:40.367 --> 06:43.075
That's home, family, friends.

06:43.236 --> 06:44.442
She'll get used to it.

06:44.604 --> 06:46.914
Man, if I could teach you
anything...

06:47.073 --> 06:49.383
( chuckles )
...about two failed marriages...

06:49.542 --> 06:51.613
( chuckles )

06:51.778 --> 06:54.588
two... ( chuckles )

06:54.748 --> 06:57.319
is you gotta learn
to compartmentalize.

07:01.054 --> 07:04.126
When you're downrange,
nothing exists.

07:04.291 --> 07:07.135
Nothing but your team,
your brothers.

07:07.294 --> 07:09.240
And when you're at home,

07:11.798 --> 07:13.471
she's everything.

07:17.137 --> 07:18.946
You wanna tell her
about the things we do,

07:19.105 --> 07:21.949
the things we see,
what we go through.

07:24.277 --> 07:25.620
Don't.

07:27.147 --> 07:29.149
It's just gonna make it worse.

07:31.418 --> 07:34.194
Get your ass home and get some rest.
You're gonna need it.

07:38.591 --> 07:40.593
Hey, AJ.

07:42.429 --> 07:43.931
Welcome to the team.

07:49.936 --> 07:51.472
Thanks.

07:51.638 --> 07:54.949
- Appreciate that, man.
- You got it.

07:58.111 --> 08:00.216
(engine turns off)

08:38.918 --> 08:41.659
This video is for my son,

08:41.821 --> 08:43.698
name TBD...

08:43.857 --> 08:46.235
I'm leaning towards
Chuck Norris Prescott...

08:46.393 --> 08:49.931
who is currently growing
in that beautiful belly.

08:51.531 --> 08:54.011
So that one day
when I'm old and fat,

08:54.167 --> 08:56.773
I can prove
that I locked down a woman,

08:56.936 --> 08:59.746
a beautiful woman
with some awesomeness.

09:00.940 --> 09:03.045
And you better listen
to what she says.

09:03.209 --> 09:05.689
What the hell, AJ?

09:05.845 --> 09:07.847
What? I'm just gonna
post this on the Web.

09:08.014 --> 09:10.016
You're gonna make
a ton of money.

09:10.183 --> 09:12.060
That's not funny.

09:12.218 --> 09:14.061
- Funny.
- ( Chuckles)

09:14.220 --> 09:17.133
- Well, I'll buy you nice things.
- Mm.

09:18.892 --> 09:21.270
Rough night?

09:21.428 --> 09:23.066
( Groans )

09:23.229 --> 09:26.233
Well, I don't speak polar bear.

09:28.401 --> 09:30.381
I'm just <i>so</i> damn tired.

09:30.537 --> 09:31.777
Come on.

09:31.938 --> 09:34.214
We only get
this limited time together

09:34.374 --> 09:36.786
and I'm fresh as a daisy.

09:36.943 --> 09:39.651
You're as pretty as one.

09:39.813 --> 09:41.884
It's just been really rough.

09:44.250 --> 09:45.991
Are they good guys?

09:47.554 --> 09:50.467
Yeah, you know, beneath the roasting,
they seem like good dudes.

09:50.623 --> 09:52.398
No.

09:52.559 --> 09:54.664
I mean are they good guys?

09:54.828 --> 09:56.432
Good SEALS?

09:56.596 --> 09:59.099
Are they gonna keep you safe?

09:59.265 --> 10:00.938
Keep you alive?

10:03.603 --> 10:06.277
This is the SEAL team
people don't know about.

10:08.408 --> 10:10.319
They're the best.

10:17.817 --> 10:20.093
( Snares )

10:42.942 --> 10:44.615
( chatter )

10:48.948 --> 10:50.985
( sighs )
What are we doing here?

10:51.151 --> 10:53.529
A string of crazy homicides
on the other side of town

10:53.686 --> 10:55.688
or another bullshit
campaign presser.

10:55.855 --> 10:57.129
Which one sounds like a story?

10:57.290 --> 10:59.668
Bella, hey,
this is our assignment, okay?

10:59.826 --> 11:00.827
So we stay here.

11:00.994 --> 11:03.531
The vice president never
takes my questions anyway.

11:03.696 --> 11:05.004
So, look, come on. I'm in tight

11:05.165 --> 11:08.078
and I'll get us right
to the front.

11:08.234 --> 11:11.545
Yeah, well,
I think we're close enough.

11:11.704 --> 11:13.741
- Back it up, Dave.
- Okay, okay.

11:13.907 --> 11:16.148
Well, somebody's not in the mood
for a joke today, huh?

11:16.309 --> 11:17.754
I think, yeah, they're coming out.
You rolling?

11:17.911 --> 11:19.891
Yeah, I'm rolling.
Shut up, come on.

11:24.017 --> 11:26.361
- ( Man coughs)
- ( Clears throat )

11:28.221 --> 11:29.529
Good afternoon, folks.

11:29.689 --> 11:31.191
Sorry for the slight delay.

11:31.357 --> 11:33.735
The vice president will say
a few short words,

11:33.893 --> 11:36.669
then open it up to questions.

11:38.198 --> 11:39.541
Here we go.

11:51.377 --> 11:52.879
Good afternoon.

11:53.046 --> 11:58.223
It's good to be back in Baton Rouge,
the state capital of Louisiana.

11:58.384 --> 12:01.058
A state that's been through
a great deal of adversity.

12:01.221 --> 12:05.033
Yet it's come out
stronger than ever.

12:05.191 --> 12:08.604
This region is a model
for this administration's efforts

12:08.761 --> 12:10.741
to get people back to work

12:10.897 --> 12:14.106
and rejoin this country's
dwindling middle class.

12:14.267 --> 12:17.771
The Cajun food
is not bad either.

12:20.573 --> 12:22.746
Now, I know you didn't come here
to listen to me talk about gumbo,

12:22.909 --> 12:24.069
so I'll take a few questions.

12:24.143 --> 12:26.054
Mr. Vice President,
Mr. Vice President.

12:26.212 --> 12:27.589
Reporter: Yes, sir, Mr. Bentley,
how do you feel

12:27.747 --> 12:29.488
that fracking affects
our community

12:29.649 --> 12:31.925
and the safety of our sensitive
coastal environment?

12:34.921 --> 12:38.095
(growling )

12:38.258 --> 12:41.102
We got a suspicious suspect
moving at 9:00.

12:42.929 --> 12:44.772
Take a look, Hayden.

13:21.501 --> 13:24.004
Sir, nothing's here.

13:24.170 --> 13:26.047
You sure you saw something?

13:28.107 --> 13:29.313
Man on intercom: I am.

13:33.780 --> 13:36.192
Mr. Vice President.
Mr. Vice President, right here.

13:36.349 --> 13:38.329
Can you comment
on recent job numbers

13:38.484 --> 13:41.397
and the accusations
that your administration

13:41.554 --> 13:43.397
skewed numbers
ahead of an election year

13:43.556 --> 13:46.162
with you being a front-runner?

13:46.326 --> 13:49.500
Well, firstly, it's nice to be called
a front-runner.

13:49.662 --> 13:52.871
And secondly, those numbers, uh,
we don't control those numbers

13:53.032 --> 13:55.012
and that's just another attempt

13:55.168 --> 13:57.170
to discredit this administration's
hard work

13:57.337 --> 13:59.510
and dedication
to the American worker.

13:59.672 --> 14:01.811
Mr. Vice President,
Vice President, right here.

14:01.974 --> 14:03.295
Bentley:
That's all we have today.

14:03.343 --> 14:05.023
Thank you for joining
our press conference.

14:05.044 --> 14:06.216
God bless America.

14:23.763 --> 14:25.868
Mr. Vice President,
I'd like to present you

14:26.032 --> 14:30.174
with a little token of appreciation
from the people of Louisiana.

14:32.672 --> 14:36.085
Ah, the brown pelican.
State bird.

14:36.242 --> 14:40.190
- The ﬂower is the magnolia, right?
- Right.

14:44.183 --> 14:46.857
Governor Tateman,
don't be like Huey Long.

14:47.019 --> 14:48.623
- Remember to duck.
- Thank you, Mr...

14:48.788 --> 14:50.699
- ( growls )
- ( Screams )

14:53.126 --> 14:55.800
( screaming )

14:55.962 --> 14:57.703
Freeze now!

14:58.965 --> 15:00.308
(gunshot)

15:00.466 --> 15:01.774
Down, down! Back inside.

15:01.934 --> 15:04.244
- Woman: Back inside!
- Man: Get back inside! Go, go, go!

15:04.404 --> 15:06.577
- Dave!
- Get down, sir.

15:08.274 --> 15:09.753
( Shrieks )

15:12.044 --> 15:13.421
( snarling )

15:15.047 --> 15:16.651
(woman screams)

15:37.437 --> 15:39.314
(phone ringing)

15:43.743 --> 15:45.586
Petty Officer Prescott.

15:45.745 --> 15:47.622
Man: Muster to base.
We got a mission briefing.

15:47.780 --> 15:50.818
- Yes, sir. Right away.
- ( Phone beeps)

15:50.983 --> 15:52.826
What's that?

15:52.985 --> 15:56.296
They're calling us in.
I gotta go.

15:56.456 --> 15:59.164
Well, what is it?

15:59.325 --> 16:00.963
He didn't say.

16:02.462 --> 16:05.272
When are you gonna be back?

16:05.431 --> 16:07.809
I don't know. I don't know.

16:10.770 --> 16:14.274
I'm sure it's nothing major.

16:14.440 --> 16:15.783
I'll call you when I know.

16:18.778 --> 16:20.451
Love you.

16:30.289 --> 16:32.200
(Sighs)

16:38.164 --> 16:40.075
Okay, gentlemen, listen up.

16:42.034 --> 16:46.346
There's an event unfolding
in the city of Baton Rouge.

16:46.506 --> 16:48.679
The vice president
is in the city

16:48.841 --> 16:50.514
on a campaign stop.

16:50.676 --> 16:54.647
A distress call went out
to his Secret Service detail.

16:54.814 --> 16:58.318
An FBI hostage rescue
was deployed.

16:58.484 --> 17:00.020
Then they went dark.

17:00.186 --> 17:02.666
We've had intermittent contact
with the Secret Service.

17:02.822 --> 17:06.359
We believe they're holed up
in the state capitol building.

17:06.526 --> 17:09.006
We can't rule out
the possibility

17:09.161 --> 17:12.233
that there was an attack
of some sort.

17:12.397 --> 17:14.935
The president wants our best assets
on the ground...

17:16.167 --> 17:18.876
and has given us a green light
to get 'em out.

17:20.339 --> 17:24.048
Baton Rouge Police are offline.

17:24.210 --> 17:27.714
To give you an idea of the potential
scope of what's going on,

17:27.880 --> 17:32.260
the FAA has imposed
a no-ﬂy zone over the city.

17:32.418 --> 17:36.298
Only military
and law enforcement.

17:36.455 --> 17:37.900
Gentlemen,

17:38.057 --> 17:40.765
this is a real potential
shitstorm

17:40.927 --> 17:43.635
and you will be dropping
into the eye of it.

17:45.231 --> 17:50.203
Lieutenant Cunningham will brief you
on your mission plan.

17:50.369 --> 17:52.076
Good luck.

17:55.141 --> 17:57.087
All right, boys, listen up.

17:57.243 --> 17:59.450
Code name for the vice president
is Elvis.

17:59.612 --> 18:02.718
Last known location of Elvis was here...
Graceland.

18:02.882 --> 18:05.954
We're to jump in, secure Elvis,

18:06.118 --> 18:08.928
and helo out of the city
as quickly as possible.

18:09.088 --> 18:12.433
There's a high school football field
a half klick to the east.

18:12.592 --> 18:13.935
That's where we'll jump in.

18:14.093 --> 18:16.774
If we're on the go, we should reach
the target in under six minutes.

18:16.929 --> 18:18.772
The bird will be on station,

18:18.931 --> 18:21.935
so we shouldn't be on the ground
more than 30 minutes.

18:22.101 --> 18:24.274
Sir, do you know if the package
is still there?

18:24.437 --> 18:25.973
No, we do not.

18:27.573 --> 18:30.349
<i>We“, what about
the VP' s Sacra Service data“?</i>

18:30.509 --> 18:34.082
We have no contact
with the Secret Service.

18:34.246 --> 18:37.625
In addition,
we will be broadcasting live.

18:37.783 --> 18:40.525
Intel boys wanna figure out
what's going on down there,

18:40.686 --> 18:43.292
so we're gonna do our best
to facilitate them.

18:43.456 --> 18:44.696
What's our rules of engagement?

18:44.824 --> 18:48.169
Still waiting
for clarification on that.

18:48.327 --> 18:50.136
Obviously,
this is American soil.

18:50.296 --> 18:53.209
These are American citizens.

18:53.366 --> 18:55.642
But you are to do
whatever you need to do

18:55.801 --> 18:57.678
to secure the vice president.

18:59.372 --> 19:01.443
Any questions?

19:01.607 --> 19:02.642
- No, sir.
- No, sir.

19:02.808 --> 19:04.310
All: No, sir.

19:11.183 --> 19:13.527
( Phone rings)

19:15.054 --> 19:16.829
Everything okay?

19:16.989 --> 19:18.366
Everything's fine.

19:18.524 --> 19:20.561
- We're getting called out.
- Okay, baby.

19:20.726 --> 19:23.468
- Please be careful.
- I always am.

19:25.331 --> 19:26.639
Let's go. We're rolling.

19:26.799 --> 19:28.710
- Emily: Okay. I love you.
- Gotta go, babe.

19:28.868 --> 19:30.677
I love you, too.

19:34.640 --> 19:37.143
( Chatter )

19:43.816 --> 19:47.195
Okay, boys, listen up.

19:47.353 --> 19:49.492
Command wants
a small footprint.

19:51.090 --> 19:53.593
So no heavy weapons.

19:53.759 --> 19:55.705
No grenades.

19:55.861 --> 19:57.169
Understood?

19:59.065 --> 20:01.204
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

20:10.876 --> 20:12.617
I don't know about you,
fellas, but...

20:12.778 --> 20:14.621
I don't like the smell
of this one.

20:14.780 --> 20:17.090
Can it, Carl.
You worry too damn much.

20:17.249 --> 20:18.728
I don't know, Chief.

20:21.887 --> 20:24.766
See? See this guy don't worry
about shit, Chief.

20:24.924 --> 20:27.404
Just saying, man,
I got a bad feeling.

20:27.560 --> 20:30.598
Chief? Talk to you?

20:37.236 --> 20:39.614
What do you say we swap out
the new guy?

20:41.207 --> 20:43.653
Now is good a time as any
to get his feet wet.

20:43.809 --> 20:45.789
I think he'll be good to go.

20:47.246 --> 20:50.784
- He fell out of the chopper.
- Polish judge gave him a 10.

20:52.585 --> 20:54.929
All right,
just keep an eye on him.

21:00.059 --> 21:02.335
- Comm check in 10.
- Yeah, yeah, roger that.

21:04.096 --> 21:05.837
Hey, guys, watch this.

21:05.998 --> 21:09.445
Hey, uh, permission to hit a bar
after we get finished with this, LT?

21:11.604 --> 21:13.948
If you guys don't fuck this up,
I'm buying tonight.

21:14.106 --> 21:16.746
Buying? I think the new guy
should be buying.

21:16.909 --> 21:19.788
Ha! Copy that.

21:19.945 --> 21:22.289
- Yeah, new guy's buying.
- Yeah.

21:22.448 --> 21:23.791
Man: New guy's buying.

21:25.117 --> 21:26.790
I like your style.

21:29.255 --> 21:30.996
How you doing, AJ?

21:32.291 --> 21:34.464
- I'm ready, LT.
- All right.

21:34.627 --> 21:36.629
Just remember your training.
You'll be fine.

21:36.796 --> 21:38.833
Roger that.

21:38.998 --> 21:40.705
Get some heat in here?

21:40.866 --> 21:43.005
Sweating like a hostage.

21:43.169 --> 21:44.273
( laughs )

21:44.436 --> 21:46.643
Man #2: What else is new?

21:47.873 --> 21:50.979
Hey, why does meat pie
sweat so much?

21:51.143 --> 21:52.986
- Did you hear that, Chief?
- Yeah.

21:53.145 --> 21:55.216
Flip flop just called you
meat pie.

21:55.381 --> 21:58.055
Get the rigger's tape.

21:58.217 --> 21:59.890
Let's go, shit birds.

22:23.742 --> 22:24.812
Cameras are up.

22:24.977 --> 22:27.014
Some interference,
but the signal is good.

22:31.350 --> 22:35.526
( Radio chatter)

22:42.094 --> 22:43.573
( dial tone, beeps )

22:43.729 --> 22:45.037
- Operator.
- Patch me through to JSOC.

22:45.197 --> 22:46.198
( Beeps, line rings)

22:46.365 --> 22:48.868
This is Agent Thomas.
I need to speak with Commander Sheer.

22:49.034 --> 22:50.843
- ( Radio chatter)
- This is an emergency.

22:51.003 --> 22:54.007
( Radio chatter)

22:58.711 --> 23:00.884
(engines whirring )

23:06.218 --> 23:10.394
( radio chatter continues)

23:25.070 --> 23:26.276
I'm CIA.

23:27.940 --> 23:29.578
It's okay.

23:31.243 --> 23:34.247
- Commander, we need to talk.
- Not now.

23:34.413 --> 23:36.324
My boys are about to
go to work.

23:36.482 --> 23:39.622
Do you have any idea what your boys
are about to jump into?

23:44.223 --> 23:47.067
You can stay here
or you can get out.

23:48.928 --> 23:50.168
Here we go.

24:00.472 --> 24:02.952
What's up?

24:03.108 --> 24:04.610
To tell you the truth,

24:04.777 --> 24:06.415
I hate jumping-

24:06.578 --> 24:08.751
You hate jumping, that's it?

24:08.914 --> 24:11.190
Time to unplug from the world.

24:11.350 --> 24:14.820
Focus on the mission at hand,
everything else will sort itself out.

24:14.987 --> 24:16.295
Roger that, Chief.

24:19.525 --> 24:21.630
( Computer beeping )

24:24.496 --> 24:26.476
Jackal 0-1,

24:26.632 --> 24:30.478
ETA six minutes.

24:43.115 --> 24:44.856
All right, boys, let's suit up.

25:54.119 --> 25:56.065
( Crickets chirping )

26:01.060 --> 26:03.131
(dog barking )

26:17.276 --> 26:19.415
Clear. One on me.

26:21.246 --> 26:23.123
Clear. One on me.

26:26.151 --> 26:27.755
One on me.

26:35.327 --> 26:37.466
Hey, hold left. Clearing right.

26:37.629 --> 26:40.269
Clear. Tight.

26:42.601 --> 26:45.241
Clear. Tight.

26:46.438 --> 26:48.440
Guys, check this out.

26:56.448 --> 26:58.189
Place is a ghost town, guys.

26:58.350 --> 27:01.263
Cunningham: Jackal actual,
this is Jackal 0-1.

27:01.420 --> 27:03.832
Graceland is empty.

27:05.457 --> 27:06.800
Damn it!

27:06.959 --> 27:10.429
Cunningham: Checkpoint one is empty.
We're heading to checkpoint two.

27:10.596 --> 27:12.542
Man on radio: Copy, Jackal 0-1.

27:12.698 --> 27:15.042
AJ on me. Carl as well.

27:15.200 --> 27:18.511
Chief, Billy,
secure the perimeter.

27:46.298 --> 27:48.244
(door squeaks)

27:48.400 --> 27:50.539
(door shuts)

27:57.843 --> 28:00.084
Hey, LT,
I'll bet they're down there.

28:00.245 --> 28:02.725
What makes you say that?

28:02.881 --> 28:05.054
Just to make my job harder.

28:05.217 --> 28:07.219
Are you scared of the dark?

28:07.386 --> 28:09.229
I ain't scared of shit.

28:09.388 --> 28:13.734
But that... is fucking creepy.

28:13.892 --> 28:15.496
Copy that.

29:35.307 --> 29:37.446
This is Lieutenant
Pete Cunningham.

29:37.609 --> 29:40.351
We're a rescue unit. Open up.

29:48.253 --> 29:51.791
- Oh, thank God. Whoa, Secret Service!
- Back up, back up.

29:51.957 --> 29:53.527
- Where's the helicopter?
- Clear.

29:53.692 --> 29:55.467
Where's the helicopter?
You guys are gonna get us out, right?

29:55.627 --> 29:58.301
- Clear!
- Clear.

29:58.463 --> 30:00.272
Elvis is in the building.

30:00.432 --> 30:02.639
( Sighs ) Mr. Vice President,
good afternoon.

30:02.801 --> 30:04.439
- We're here to get you out.
- Thank you.

30:04.603 --> 30:06.674
You are a sight
for sore eyes, sir.

30:06.838 --> 30:09.045
What is going on out there?

30:09.207 --> 30:10.982
We have no idea just yet.

30:11.143 --> 30:14.181
Elvis is secure.
I'm sending AJ up.

30:14.346 --> 30:16.952
Chief, secure the LZ
and the perimeter.

30:17.115 --> 30:19.152
Billy, get down here.

30:21.987 --> 30:24.490
You okay?

30:24.656 --> 30:26.499
Don't even think about it.

30:26.658 --> 30:29.832
I will leave you here.

30:29.995 --> 30:31.906
You okay? Yeah?

30:32.064 --> 30:33.407
You okay?

30:33.565 --> 30:36.341
Is everyone okay?

30:36.501 --> 30:38.174
Yes? Everyone okay?

30:38.337 --> 30:39.714
All right.

30:39.871 --> 30:42.852
- Billy, where you at?
- Coming in!

30:46.011 --> 30:47.854
Go take a look
at the vice president.

30:50.048 --> 30:51.857
Hey, sir.

30:52.017 --> 30:53.394
How you doing?

30:53.552 --> 30:55.361
Yeah, I'm fine.

30:55.520 --> 30:58.228
In the storage room, uh,
one of my detail is severely hurt.

30:58.390 --> 31:00.028
Please, help him.

31:00.192 --> 31:02.399
- Help him.
- Okay, I'll get to him right away,

31:02.561 --> 31:04.563
but I gotta take a look
at you first, okay?

31:04.730 --> 31:07.267
Smile. Smile.

31:08.667 --> 31:10.408
- Billy: Any pain?
- Bentley: No.

31:10.569 --> 31:12.378
How are you feeling?

31:12.537 --> 31:15.211
- A little woozy.
- Yeah?

31:15.374 --> 31:19.379
I want you to remember three things...
cat, dog, and bird.

31:19.544 --> 31:22.548
Jackal actual,
this is Jackal 0-1, copy?

31:22.714 --> 31:25.058
Sheer: Copy, Jackal 0-1.
Go ahead.

31:25.217 --> 31:27.424
Elvis is secure.
Ready for extract.

31:27.586 --> 31:30.692
Copy, Jackal 0-1.
Sandman's en route.

31:30.856 --> 31:32.358
ETA 12 minutes.

31:32.524 --> 31:35.300
Copy that. Jackal 1 out.

31:35.460 --> 31:38.407
Copy, Jackal 0-1. Out.

31:44.703 --> 31:46.580
What the hell is going on
out there?

31:46.738 --> 31:49.810
Well, you don't worry
about that.

31:49.975 --> 31:52.455
You just stick close to us.

31:52.611 --> 31:54.750
- You'll be good to go, okay?
- All right.

31:54.913 --> 31:56.586
All right, where is that guy?

31:56.748 --> 31:58.455
In the storage room.

31:58.617 --> 32:00.995
He's good to go, LT.

32:06.558 --> 32:07.969
Oh, thank God.

32:09.461 --> 32:11.099
How you doing?

32:11.263 --> 32:15.006
- I'm okay.
- My name's Billy. I'm a medic.

32:16.435 --> 32:18.506
What do we have here?

32:18.670 --> 32:20.650
All right,
I'm gonna take a look.

32:26.111 --> 32:29.581
- It's pretty deep.
- Yeah, but you did great.

32:33.452 --> 32:34.988
I got it from here.

32:35.153 --> 32:36.928
What's this about?

32:37.088 --> 32:39.796
(sighs ) To keep him
from grabbing at me.

32:39.958 --> 32:42.802
He's been really agitated.

32:49.000 --> 32:51.310
Hey, buddy, you in there?

32:53.972 --> 32:54.973
Come here.

32:55.140 --> 32:57.450
( Snarls )

32:57.609 --> 32:59.885
Hold still, hold still.
It's all right, it's all right.

33:05.550 --> 33:07.120
Has he been given anything?

33:07.285 --> 33:09.697
There's nothing to give.

33:15.460 --> 33:17.497
This guy needs a hospital.

33:18.864 --> 33:21.470
Cunningham:
Get him ready to move.

33:21.633 --> 33:23.237
Roger that.

33:25.470 --> 33:27.882
We're gonna get this guy
some help.

33:28.039 --> 33:30.041
But what I need you to do
is go in the other room

33:30.208 --> 33:31.516
and get ready to move.

33:33.144 --> 33:34.589
It's gonna be all right.

33:34.746 --> 33:37.226
We're gonna get you
out of here.

33:38.583 --> 33:40.028
- All right?
- Okay.

33:40.185 --> 33:41.823
- All right.
- Okay.

33:41.987 --> 33:43.830
Go on, then.

33:52.397 --> 33:54.343
(Sighs)

33:55.734 --> 33:56.906
So what happened here?

33:57.068 --> 33:58.604
Where's the rest
of your detail?

33:58.770 --> 34:01.341
Dead. Th-they're all dead.

34:03.008 --> 34:06.114
- They attacked us.
- Who attacked you?

34:07.345 --> 34:10.349
They were just people, man,
just...

34:10.514 --> 34:12.722
But they were different.

34:14.185 --> 34:16.130
Agent?

34:16.288 --> 34:19.235
- Hey, agent, hey.
- We kept shooting at 'em, man.

34:19.391 --> 34:20.927
But they wouldn't go down,
none of 'em.

34:21.092 --> 34:22.900
- They just kept coming and coming.
- Shh.

34:23.061 --> 34:25.098
- They were monsters.
- Hey, hey, hey.

34:25.263 --> 34:27.243
- They were monsters, man. All of them.
- Shh.

34:27.399 --> 34:28.878
Your boss is still alive.

34:29.034 --> 34:31.310
Uh, excuse me, sir?

34:31.469 --> 34:33.039
Can... can you come see
for a second?

34:35.072 --> 34:36.416
(Sighs)

34:41.413 --> 34:43.493
I'm a journalist.
I was covering the press conference

34:43.547 --> 34:45.255
when all this happened and I...

34:45.417 --> 34:47.590
Hey, how's it going up there?

34:49.286 --> 34:51.733
All stations,
west side is clear.

34:51.889 --> 34:53.062
Moving south.

34:53.224 --> 34:57.070
Moving south to your location.
How copy.

35:08.907 --> 35:10.079
North is clear. Heading east.

35:10.241 --> 35:12.346
LZ Bravo is clean.

35:12.510 --> 35:15.286
Best extract point for Elvis.

35:15.447 --> 35:16.585
Break.

35:16.748 --> 35:20.787
AJ, moving east
to your location.

35:20.952 --> 35:22.295
How copy, over.

35:22.454 --> 35:23.990
All right, chopper's en route.

35:24.155 --> 35:25.828
Six minutes, be ready to move.

35:25.991 --> 35:27.629
Yes?

35:27.792 --> 35:29.772
Something big is going on here.

35:29.928 --> 35:31.464
Show him the footage, Dave.

35:31.630 --> 35:33.974
- Look.
- This is what attacked us.

35:34.132 --> 35:35.805
They have to be sick, right?

35:35.967 --> 35:39.312
I mean, look.
Men, women, even kids.

35:39.471 --> 35:41.815
I mean, what do you think
would make them do this?

35:41.973 --> 35:44.317
- Do you see the way they look?
- Yeah, man.

35:44.476 --> 35:46.979
Look, they...
they were like rabid dogs.

35:47.145 --> 35:48.818
And then...
and then look at this.

35:50.215 --> 35:51.990
You see that?

35:52.150 --> 35:55.393
I know this sounds crazy,
but I think once someone is bitten,

35:55.553 --> 35:57.157
they change.

35:57.322 --> 35:59.529
They turn into one of them.

36:00.825 --> 36:03.169
What did you get yourself into?

36:04.629 --> 36:06.074
You all right?

36:06.231 --> 36:07.904
You with me?

36:17.809 --> 36:19.516
Whoa, whoa, easy, easy, easy.

36:19.678 --> 36:21.351
Get down.

36:28.253 --> 36:30.164
I could use a hand in here!

36:30.321 --> 36:31.857
On my Way'-

36:33.224 --> 36:35.363
- What's going on?
- What's it look like?

36:35.527 --> 36:38.701
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, we're friendly.
Just stop, hey.

36:40.932 --> 36:42.411
Get him off me!

36:42.567 --> 36:44.877
(groaning, grunting)

36:47.105 --> 36:48.379
Oh, my God, what's going on?

36:55.680 --> 36:57.956
( Snarls )

37:01.386 --> 37:02.558
(gunshot)

37:02.721 --> 37:03.859
Hold your fire!

37:06.725 --> 37:08.261
Look at his face, man.

37:08.426 --> 37:10.269
I told you guys
he was gonna turn.

37:10.428 --> 37:12.874
- I told all of them.
- 'P?

37:13.031 --> 37:15.033
You have to shoot 'em
in the head, man.

37:15.200 --> 37:17.407
It's the only way to be sure.

37:17.569 --> 37:19.209
- You need to calm down.
- No, this is it.

37:19.270 --> 37:20.544
- This is it. This is the end.
- You need to calm down.

37:20.705 --> 37:22.185
- Calm down!
- Calm down. Don't panic.

37:22.240 --> 37:23.776
Relax.

37:23.942 --> 37:25.615
Chill out.

37:25.777 --> 37:29.122
- Go.
- Jackal 1, this is Jackal actual.

37:29.280 --> 37:30.759
Copy, Jackal 0-1.

37:30.915 --> 37:34.124
- Yo, where's that damn bird?
- Six minutes to extraction point, sir.

37:34.285 --> 37:35.787
Let me talk to Commander Sheer.

37:35.954 --> 37:38.935
Yes, sir. Hold, 1.

37:39.090 --> 37:40.501
Go ahead, Pete.

37:40.658 --> 37:42.831
Sir, I don't know
if you're seeing this, but...

37:42.994 --> 37:44.667
this isn't right.

37:44.829 --> 37:45.967
This is not a riot.

37:46.131 --> 37:48.805
Just get the VP on the bird
and get out of there.

37:51.436 --> 37:53.438
- Not now.
- Yes, now.

37:56.241 --> 37:57.652
This isn't some riot.

37:57.809 --> 37:59.652
This is a biological attack

37:59.811 --> 38:01.484
and I may have a way
to stop it.

38:01.646 --> 38:03.353
What are you talking about?

38:03.515 --> 38:05.586
I have a team
that's been tracking this.

38:05.750 --> 38:10.324
A biological agent that's meant
to take down a superpower.

38:10.488 --> 38:12.627
You can't deny
what you're seeing here.

38:14.459 --> 38:15.995
- Okay, go on.
- Okay.

38:16.161 --> 38:17.640
First of all,

38:17.796 --> 38:19.957
you cannot let anyone
who's been bitten on that flight.

38:20.098 --> 38:23.136
They most likely
have already been infected.

38:23.301 --> 38:24.302
Secondly,

38:24.469 --> 38:26.449
I have a high-value asset
in the city

38:26.604 --> 38:28.015
that needs an evac
with her staff,

38:28.173 --> 38:31.052
and your men are the only ones
in position who can do that.

38:31.209 --> 38:33.712
The key to stopping this
from spreading

38:33.878 --> 38:36.484
may be with them.

38:36.648 --> 38:38.355
Trust your eyes, Commander.

38:38.516 --> 38:40.826
Have you ever seen anything
like this before?

38:48.459 --> 38:50.996
Pete.

38:51.162 --> 38:53.199
New orders coming in.

38:55.400 --> 38:59.815
I need you and your boys
to stay on the ground a little longer.

38:59.971 --> 39:02.178
I have a second extract
in the works.

39:02.340 --> 39:05.514
Get the package on the bird
and we'll forward you details.

39:05.677 --> 39:07.156
And, Pete,

39:07.312 --> 39:09.553
if any of those people
have been bitten,

39:09.714 --> 39:13.025
they stay on the ground,
that's an order.

39:13.184 --> 39:14.857
Yes, sir.

39:15.019 --> 39:17.829
This may be
some biological agent.

39:17.989 --> 39:21.163
No one that's been bitten
gets out of the city, no exceptions.

39:21.326 --> 39:23.363
Copy that. Jackal 1 out.

39:23.528 --> 39:25.371
All right, be ready to move.

39:25.530 --> 39:27.532
We're being re tasked.

39:27.699 --> 39:30.873
We'll get more details
once Elvis is in the bird.

39:31.035 --> 39:34.175
Okay, ladies and gentlemen,

39:34.339 --> 39:36.341
looks like we're getting out of here
just in time.

39:36.507 --> 39:38.714
Bird will be here
in six minutes.

39:38.877 --> 39:40.254
Mr. Vice President,

39:40.411 --> 39:43.221
I need to get you and your staff
on the roof and ready for evac.

39:43.381 --> 39:46.021
One last thing.

39:46.184 --> 39:47.857
Has anyone been bitten?

39:48.019 --> 39:49.293
No.

39:59.864 --> 40:01.571
I'm gonna get you
out of here, sir.

40:03.067 --> 40:04.569
Let's get you home.

40:07.639 --> 40:09.118
Hey.

40:09.274 --> 40:11.049
- Are you okay?
- Fine.

40:11.209 --> 40:12.745
I'm just a little light-headed.

40:12.911 --> 40:16.620
I haven't eaten
and I'm overwhelmed, I guess.

40:16.781 --> 40:18.454
Okay, I'll wait for you.

40:18.616 --> 40:21.722
No. No, I'll see you upstairs.

40:49.781 --> 40:53.456
You're getting out of here
no matter what.

40:53.618 --> 40:55.655
There's some action
out on the street.

40:55.820 --> 40:57.629
Got the guys covered
to the south

40:57.789 --> 40:59.200
if you wanna move.

40:59.357 --> 41:01.633
A couple civilians in distress.

41:01.793 --> 41:03.313
- ( Snarls )
- Permission to intervene?

41:03.328 --> 41:05.274
Negative.

41:05.430 --> 41:08.138
Do not give up our position.
Do not jeopardize the mission.

41:08.299 --> 41:10.279
- These are definitely bad guys, LT.
- ( Snarls )

41:10.435 --> 41:12.005
- I'm ready.
- Clear shot.

41:12.170 --> 41:13.308
Stand down.

41:14.839 --> 41:16.318
We're really gonna
let these people die, LT?

41:16.474 --> 41:18.181
( Snarling )

41:19.444 --> 41:21.048
- Stand down, damn it!
- ( Girl screams)

41:21.212 --> 41:23.158
( snarling )

41:26.351 --> 41:27.489
( screaming )

41:30.788 --> 41:32.699
( screeching )

41:35.626 --> 41:38.573
Dear God.

41:38.730 --> 41:41.370
- Tell Sandman to hurry his ass up.
- Yes, sir.

41:47.238 --> 41:48.842
(distant snarling )

41:50.641 --> 41:52.484
What the hell is going on,
Lieutenant?

41:52.643 --> 41:53.883
Why are civilians
hunting people

41:54.045 --> 41:56.821
in the streets of goddamn
Baton Rouge?

41:56.981 --> 41:59.860
You gonna tell us what's going on here
or what, Chief?

42:02.253 --> 42:03.596
Hey, Carl.

42:03.755 --> 42:04.825
(distant snarling )

42:04.989 --> 42:07.026
You know that bad feeling
you had?

42:08.593 --> 42:10.163
Now I've got it.

42:12.163 --> 42:14.404
You need to let me know
what you got.

42:14.565 --> 42:16.408
What are my men up against?

42:16.567 --> 42:19.275
We believe it to be
a biological agent.

42:19.437 --> 42:21.576
A few years ago,
we picked up some chatter

42:21.739 --> 42:25.380
about a virus that could potentially
weaponize a human.

42:25.543 --> 42:28.717
Make an army out of...
for lack of a better word...

42:28.880 --> 42:29.950
zombies...

42:31.916 --> 42:34.260
to tear apart society
from the inside.

42:34.419 --> 42:37.559
Now, we have some
heavily classified labs,

42:37.722 --> 42:40.896
one in particular, which has been
researching this biology,

42:41.059 --> 42:42.197
is in Baton Rouge.

42:42.360 --> 42:45.398
So this is something
that could've come from your lab.

42:45.563 --> 42:47.099
No, we've been in contact
with the group leader

42:47.265 --> 42:49.108
and there's been no breach
on their end.

42:49.267 --> 42:51.873
Besides, we haven't even been able
to make it work.

42:52.036 --> 42:55.779
But these are the best experts
in this area

42:55.940 --> 42:57.942
and their research
may hold the key

42:58.109 --> 42:59.452
to counter this virus.

42:59.610 --> 43:02.614
Well, hopefully
we're not too late.

43:02.780 --> 43:04.555
There's one more thing.

43:04.715 --> 43:06.217
Once this was on our radar,

43:06.384 --> 43:08.591
the D.O.D.'s
US Strategic Command

43:08.753 --> 43:10.926
authored Con Op 8888,

43:11.089 --> 43:14.127
a response study outlining
how we would react

43:14.292 --> 43:15.771
to such an attack.

43:15.927 --> 43:17.668
Nothing was ever formally
implemented,

43:17.829 --> 43:21.106
but right now it's being pitched
to the president.

43:21.265 --> 43:23.802
The real reason the VP
was in Baton Rouge.

43:23.968 --> 43:26.972
The speech at the state capitol

43:27.138 --> 43:28.412
was just a cover.

43:28.573 --> 43:30.610
And?

43:30.775 --> 43:32.448
And the first step
is containment

43:32.610 --> 43:33.987
by any means necessary.

43:34.145 --> 43:37.319
It's only a matter of time
before everyone's infected.

43:37.482 --> 43:39.792
Luckily, the city is isolated,

43:39.951 --> 43:42.022
which could be
our saving grace.

43:42.186 --> 43:44.462
No one goes in or out.

43:44.622 --> 43:46.431
No one.

43:56.801 --> 43:59.441
Activate all military resources
statewide.

43:59.604 --> 44:02.175
Block off all <i>access</i>
in and out of Baton Rouge.

44:02.340 --> 44:05.287
This is a code red. Move. Move!

44:40.077 --> 44:41.681
( Radio chatter)

45:14.178 --> 45:16.021
( snarling )

45:20.751 --> 45:22.059
( coughs )

45:26.190 --> 45:28.568
Guys, we got incoming,
southeast side.

45:28.726 --> 45:30.296
Stop where you are!

45:30.461 --> 45:32.065
I said stop!

45:32.230 --> 45:34.141
LT, what's your order?

45:34.298 --> 45:36.904
- Permission to fire.
- ( Snarling )

45:37.068 --> 45:38.240
Slop!

45:44.575 --> 45:45.952
(grunts)

45:46.110 --> 45:48.420
- Travis!
- ( Screaming )

45:50.081 --> 45:52.083
(gunshots)

45:54.552 --> 45:57.431
- Chief!
- ( Gunshots)

45:57.588 --> 45:58.589
Chief!

46:00.157 --> 46:01.830
- Shit!
- Cunningham: Somebody talk to me.

46:01.993 --> 46:04.132
- Man: Shit, hang in there, Chief.
- Cunningham: Who's got eyes?

46:04.295 --> 46:06.104
Billy, get your ass down here.

46:06.264 --> 46:07.607
Billy's on his way, Chief.
Hang in there, brother.

46:07.765 --> 46:08.766
Billy is on his way.

46:12.770 --> 46:14.681
Hang in there, brother.
Billy's on his way.

46:14.839 --> 46:17.251
- ( labored breathing )
- Chief, hang in there, brother.

46:17.408 --> 46:19.615
Hang in there. Shit!

46:19.777 --> 46:21.313
Shit.

46:21.479 --> 46:23.584
Billy!

46:23.748 --> 46:25.022
Shit.

46:25.182 --> 46:26.923
Come on, brother.

46:27.084 --> 46:29.325
Oh, this ain't good, this ain't good,
this ain't good.

46:31.489 --> 46:33.298
All right, yeah,
you're gonna be good.

46:33.457 --> 46:35.095
- You're gonna be good, brother.
- You're good, Chief.

46:35.259 --> 46:37.170
But just in case
you're not, uh,

46:37.328 --> 46:38.671
can I have your Harley?

46:38.829 --> 46:40.502
What, you want some morphine?

46:40.665 --> 46:42.008
- Hold that. Hold that.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I got it.

46:42.166 --> 46:43.645
I got it, I got it, I got it.

46:43.801 --> 46:46.441
( Travis wheezing )

46:46.604 --> 46:47.947
Travis: No.

46:48.105 --> 46:50.142
- Whiskey.
- ( Billy chuckles)

46:51.676 --> 46:53.815
- Whiskey?
- Can't give you morphine yet, brother.

46:53.978 --> 46:56.481
- Give me some whiskey.
- Whiskey?

46:56.647 --> 46:57.853
All right.

46:58.015 --> 47:00.154
Shit. Come on.

47:00.318 --> 47:01.524
- Come on, Chief.
- Travis.

47:01.686 --> 47:02.687
Hey, hey, hey.

47:02.853 --> 47:03.854
Hey.

47:04.021 --> 47:05.796
- Hey, come on, Chief.
- Travis!

47:05.956 --> 47:08.960
- Travis! Hold that.
- Shit.

47:09.126 --> 47:13.165
Come on, Chief!

47:13.331 --> 47:15.038
Stay with me, Travis.

47:18.369 --> 47:19.814
Travis?

47:19.970 --> 47:21.972
Stay with me, bro.

47:26.410 --> 47:29.914
- Stay with me, Travis!
- ( Thudding )

47:30.081 --> 47:32.220
Come on, man!

47:39.357 --> 47:40.734
(Sighs)

47:52.103 --> 47:53.741
All stations this net.

47:53.904 --> 47:55.508
Jackal 2 is expired.

47:55.673 --> 47:59.416
I repeat, Jackal 2 is expired.

47:59.577 --> 48:00.851
Copy that.

48:01.011 --> 48:03.013
Jackal 2 is expired.

48:03.180 --> 48:04.352
Out.

48:04.515 --> 48:06.722
- ( Snarling )
- ( Woman screams)

48:06.884 --> 48:09.763
( man screams )

48:09.920 --> 48:11.900
(squelching )

48:17.094 --> 48:18.937
Cunningham: Support 2!

48:19.096 --> 48:21.940
Give me 2, God damn it!

48:22.099 --> 48:24.477
- Jackal 2 is expired.
- Fuck.

48:32.877 --> 48:35.380
Jackal 2 is expired.

48:35.546 --> 48:36.820
(growling )

48:36.981 --> 48:39.427
Watch his mouth! Watch it.

48:39.583 --> 48:42.462
Support 2! Support 2!

48:42.620 --> 48:44.896
Watch his mouth!

48:47.725 --> 48:50.797
- Billy!
- He was one of the FBI rescue team!

48:50.961 --> 48:52.804
- ( Growling )
- Drop this fucker!

48:52.963 --> 48:55.136
Watch his mouth!

48:55.299 --> 48:58.974
His adrenaline's obviously spiking
off the charts.

48:59.136 --> 49:00.479
Carl: My fucking adrenaline
is spiking,

49:00.638 --> 49:03.482
you don't see me
going fucking crazy!

49:03.641 --> 49:05.348
Somethings changing
his physiology,

49:05.509 --> 49:07.682
like a... a virus

49:07.845 --> 49:10.416
or... but those take days
or weeks to integrate.

49:10.581 --> 49:11.855
AJ: So it's contagious?

49:12.016 --> 49:14.587
Well, yeah,
apparently through the saliva

49:14.752 --> 49:16.254
or any ﬂuids.

49:16.420 --> 49:18.832
- Why the hell is he resisting bullets?
- God!

49:18.989 --> 49:21.196
Whatever this thing is
is obviously...

49:21.358 --> 49:24.703
uh, interacting
with his central nervous system.

49:24.862 --> 49:27.172
- ( Cunningham groans)
- Hold... hold his arm.

49:40.878 --> 49:42.619
Cunningham: What?

49:42.780 --> 49:44.555
Zero pain response.

49:46.116 --> 49:48.460
It looks like Federal was right.

49:48.619 --> 49:52.032
If we... if we inhibit the signal
to the central nervous system,

49:52.189 --> 49:53.691
it should shut down
the whole organ.

49:53.858 --> 49:55.735
Give me a sidearm.

49:58.062 --> 49:59.905
Clear!

50:01.332 --> 50:03.073
(gunshot)

50:06.804 --> 50:09.580
( panting )

50:11.242 --> 50:13.017
(Cunningham groans)

50:20.251 --> 50:22.492
Shit.

50:22.653 --> 50:23.723
(man coughing)

50:29.693 --> 50:31.536
Fuck.

50:34.732 --> 50:38.339
- ( Panting )
- ( Muffled dialogue)

50:41.906 --> 50:43.908
Soto: Jackal 0-1, Jackal actual,
come in.

50:44.074 --> 50:46.418
This is Jackal 1, over, actual.

50:46.577 --> 50:49.114
Sandman on final approach,
LZ Bravo.

50:49.280 --> 50:51.692
Copy that.

51:00.291 --> 51:02.362
I need to talk to you
for a minute.

51:07.131 --> 51:08.439
Go, go, go.

51:10.768 --> 51:12.805
( Keyboard clacking )

51:12.970 --> 51:14.711
I think we should stay.

51:14.872 --> 51:17.318
- Are you out of your mind?
- It's the story of a lifetime.

51:17.474 --> 51:18.976
<i>R's our 'gob to cover 'n.</i>

51:20.277 --> 51:21.779
I don't know, Amanda.

51:21.946 --> 51:24.483
I mean, this sounds like
a really bad idea.

51:24.648 --> 51:26.650
We're lucky to still be alive.

51:30.387 --> 51:32.799
- Why push it?
- You can go if you want.

51:32.957 --> 51:34.300
Just leave me the camera.

51:34.458 --> 51:37.268
Okay-

51:37.428 --> 51:39.066
Fine.

51:39.229 --> 51:40.606
I'll stay.

51:40.764 --> 51:42.444
Okay, your ride will be here
in 30 seconds.

51:42.566 --> 51:44.807
When the chopper lands, we're gonna
be escorting you out single-file.

51:44.969 --> 51:46.312
We're staying.

51:46.470 --> 51:48.814
- Ma'am, I highly recommend...
- You can't force us to go.

51:50.441 --> 51:53.513
It's a free country, but just know
there is no more help coming.

51:56.146 --> 51:57.147
Okay-

52:24.708 --> 52:26.551
One! Two!

52:26.710 --> 52:29.190
Mr. President,
have a good trip.

52:29.346 --> 52:30.620
Three.

52:33.183 --> 52:34.662
We're good!

52:43.027 --> 52:45.530
- Oh, shit.
- Incoming!

52:54.905 --> 52:56.816
My God.

52:56.974 --> 52:59.511
Okay, come on,
this is too dangerous. Let's go.

52:59.677 --> 53:01.884
Let's go, let's go.

53:08.552 --> 53:10.054
( Snarling )

53:13.090 --> 53:14.728
What the hell was that?

53:14.892 --> 53:16.565
Must be attracted to the helo.

53:16.727 --> 53:17.762
Must be.

53:20.230 --> 53:21.766
Pilot: Ma'am, get back!

53:21.932 --> 53:24.435
- Get back!
- ( Screaming )

53:24.601 --> 53:25.705
Oh, no.

53:25.869 --> 53:28.008
- Shit.
- Pilot: Mayday, Mayday!

53:28.172 --> 53:29.173
( Explosion )

53:29.339 --> 53:31.512
Oh, God! ( Gasps )

53:33.744 --> 53:35.382
Fuck.

53:37.715 --> 53:41.026
Sandman, do you copy?
Sandman, do you copy?

53:41.185 --> 53:43.096
What are your coordinates,
Sandman, over?

53:44.521 --> 53:47.866
Jackal actual, this is Jackal 0-1,
Sandman is down.

53:48.025 --> 53:50.027
I repeat,

53:50.194 --> 53:52.265
Sandman is down.

53:54.531 --> 53:57.478
- That could've been us.
- Oh, my God.

54:03.941 --> 54:05.943
We need to check for survivors.

54:06.110 --> 54:08.386
No, we need to get our asset
while there's still time.

54:08.545 --> 54:11.048
That's the damn vice president
out there.

54:11.215 --> 54:13.559
If there's a chance he's alive,
we better make sure.

54:13.717 --> 54:15.458
My men will get
to the crash site.

54:15.619 --> 54:16.996
There isn't any time.

54:17.154 --> 54:19.154
Imagine if this spreads
to the rest of the country.

54:19.223 --> 54:21.134
These may be the only people
in the world

54:21.291 --> 54:23.669
who can stop that
from happening.

54:25.162 --> 54:28.302
I need surveillance over the city
of Baton Rouge immediately.

54:28.465 --> 54:29.910
What are you doing, Sheer?

54:30.067 --> 54:31.827
It's vital we have overhead feed
of the city.

54:31.835 --> 54:33.475
It's imperative
that we don't lose contact

54:33.504 --> 54:34.642
with our men on the ground.

54:34.805 --> 54:38.810
We need to see the crash site
and get eyes on the situation.

54:41.845 --> 54:44.189
Sandman, do you copy?
This is base, over.

54:44.348 --> 54:46.828
Sir, we're not getting a feed
from Sandman.

54:48.152 --> 54:49.995
Jackal 1,
this is Jackal actual.

54:50.154 --> 54:51.462
What are our orders?

54:51.622 --> 54:54.501
Continue to secondary target.

54:54.658 --> 54:56.535
Sir, I've got one K.l.A.

54:56.693 --> 54:58.673
I can't really describe
what I'm seeing out here.

54:58.829 --> 55:00.172
Do you have any more information
for us?

55:00.330 --> 55:03.834
CIA thinks this is
a deliberate attack.

55:04.001 --> 55:06.379
Biological warfare.

55:07.971 --> 55:10.349
There's a classified
government lab

55:10.507 --> 55:12.680
about a mile south
of your position.

55:12.843 --> 55:15.016
It's the tallest building
in that direction.

55:15.179 --> 55:17.853
You should be able to see it
from your position.

55:19.183 --> 55:21.857
On the eighth floor
is a CIA black lab.

55:22.019 --> 55:26.024
The scientists on that floor are vital
to stopping the outbreak.

55:26.190 --> 55:28.534
I need you to get in there
and get 'em out quickly.

55:28.692 --> 55:29.966
We don't have a lot of time.

55:30.127 --> 55:33.301
- How much time do we have?
- An hour, maybe less.

55:33.463 --> 55:37.411
I've got a bird on standby
stationed just outside the city.

55:39.369 --> 55:42.680
Now, once they give the orders
for complete lock-off,

55:44.141 --> 55:46.712
you will be trapped.

55:46.877 --> 55:48.584
Copy that.

55:50.380 --> 55:52.382
All right, we're moving
to the secondary target.

55:52.549 --> 55:54.495
It's that building
straight ahead.

55:54.651 --> 55:56.562
CIA has scientists there
that need rescuing.

55:56.720 --> 55:57.721
We might be able
to stop this thing.

55:57.888 --> 56:00.232
We also have a new R.O.E...

56:00.390 --> 56:02.336
anyone who looks like a threat,

56:02.492 --> 56:03.732
anyone who looks infected,

56:03.894 --> 56:06.101
- you shoot to kill.
- ( Distant snarling )

56:06.263 --> 56:08.402
Head shots, make 'em count.

56:08.565 --> 56:10.875
I don't know, LT.
You saw how fast they move.

56:11.034 --> 56:13.173
- We get caught in the open...
- Yeah, this mission's straight fucked.

56:13.337 --> 56:16.409
- No reinforcements?
- Would you guys lock it the fuck up?

56:16.573 --> 56:19.417
We are on our own
in hostile territory.

56:19.576 --> 56:21.578
This is nothing new.

56:21.745 --> 56:23.053
We good?

56:23.213 --> 56:24.556
All: Yes, sir.

56:25.916 --> 56:27.520
What about them?

56:29.019 --> 56:30.521
(Sighs)

56:32.623 --> 56:34.102
How you guys doing?

56:34.258 --> 56:36.397
You okay? We're gonna make a quick stop
and then we'll get home safe.

56:36.560 --> 56:37.595
AJ.

56:39.563 --> 56:41.133
Keep an eye on them, okay?

56:41.298 --> 56:43.608
You do what AJ says,
you'll be just fine.

56:45.235 --> 56:46.305
Stay close, stay quiet.

56:48.038 --> 56:49.574
Okay, boys.

56:49.740 --> 56:51.048
Move out.

56:56.380 --> 56:58.621
( Screaming )

57:39.256 --> 57:41.258
Roger that, moving.

58:03.814 --> 58:05.851

58:20.130 --> 58:22.007
Go. Come on, come on, come on.

AJ?

59:28.131 --> 59:29.940
(distant snarling )

59:39.042 --> 59:40.919
- Amanda: They're coming.
- Go, go.

59:44.247 --> 59:45.555
Wait.

59:47.317 --> 59:48.660
To me it looks safe.

59:59.129 --> 01:00:00.164
Shit!

01:00:00.330 --> 01:00:02.970
- I lost my radio. Damn it!
- Well, that's just great.

01:00:03.133 --> 01:00:04.635
Looks like we're on our own.

01:00:04.801 --> 01:00:07.304
We're gonna die, aren't we?

01:00:07.471 --> 01:00:08.814
( Scoffs )

01:00:08.972 --> 01:00:10.474
Everyone dies.

01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:12.142
It won't be today.

01:00:12.309 --> 01:00:13.652
AJ, do you copy?

01:00:13.810 --> 01:00:15.653
- Carl: Shit! Shit.
- Cunningham: AJ!

01:00:15.812 --> 01:00:18.252
- AJ, over. AJ, do you copy?
- Jesus Christ, we gotta go back!

01:00:18.315 --> 01:00:20.317
I saw him get swarmed.

01:00:20.484 --> 01:00:23.522
- We don't leave a man behind.
- He knows where the extract point is.

01:00:23.687 --> 01:00:25.166
Shit!

01:00:25.322 --> 01:00:28.201
And if he's alive, he'll make it.
The mission comes first.

01:00:28.358 --> 01:00:31.805
- What if that was you?
- Leave me. Leave me.

01:00:31.962 --> 01:00:34.533
You see what's going on
around here?

01:00:34.698 --> 01:00:36.803
We got people who might be able
to stop this thing.

01:00:36.967 --> 01:00:38.173
- Billy: Hold on!
- ( Tires screech )

01:00:38.335 --> 01:00:40.941

- Amanda: Oh, my God!
- Don't you even move.

01:00:45.675 --> 01:00:48.849
Hey, easy, man. Put the gun down.
We're not gonna hurt you.

01:00:49.012 --> 01:00:51.322
How do I know
you're not one of them?

01:00:51.481 --> 01:00:52.721
We're the good guys.

01:00:52.883 --> 01:00:54.294
Look.

01:00:54.451 --> 01:00:56.556
I don't know who you are.

01:00:56.720 --> 01:00:58.529
I don't know what's going on.

01:00:58.688 --> 01:01:00.497
An hour ago I watched a cop

01:01:00.657 --> 01:01:03.001
kill a 10-year-old girl
on my front lawn.

01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:06.334
All I know
is you're on my property

01:01:06.496 --> 01:01:10.808
and I have every right
to shoot you dead...

01:01:10.967 --> 01:01:12.640
right here and now.

01:01:12.802 --> 01:01:14.975
Nobody's shooting anybody,
you hear me?

01:01:15.138 --> 01:01:17.243
We're just passing through.
You can come with us.

- How do I know you're not one of them?

How do I know
you're not one of them?

01:01:24.915 --> 01:01:25.916
All righty, then.

01:01:26.082 --> 01:01:28.892
No, you're murderers out there.
How do I know?

01:01:29.052 --> 01:01:31.032
- You're all dead murderers.
- ( Snarling )

01:01:33.256 --> 01:01:35.258
This is my hideout.

01:01:35.425 --> 01:01:38.770
All righty, then, well,
we'll just be on our way, then.

- Dave, do something!
- You hear that, huh?

01:01:44.434 --> 01:01:45.708
They're gonna bust right through here
and rip us apart.

01:01:45.869 --> 01:01:47.177
Is that what you want?

01:01:54.077 --> 01:01:55.522
We're getting out of here.

01:01:55.679 --> 01:01:57.920
You got that?

01:03:55.665 --> 01:03:58.805
Jackal 0-1 to Jackal actual.

01:04:01.237 --> 01:04:02.238
Damn.

01:04:04.341 --> 01:04:07.345
Get that chopper airborne.

01:04:09.045 --> 01:04:12.356
Jackal actual, this is Jackal 1.
We are at the target building.

01:04:12.515 --> 01:04:14.392
What is the status
of the chopper?

01:04:16.519 --> 01:04:18.157
Moving.

01:04:22.425 --> 01:04:23.733
Fuck.

01:04:26.529 --> 01:04:28.167
Stairwell.

01:04:55.125 --> 01:04:56.627
Set.

01:04:59.696 --> 01:05:01.369
Hallway.

01:05:03.266 --> 01:05:04.870
Hey, LT,

01:05:05.034 --> 01:05:08.140
got a blood trail here.

01:05:08.304 --> 01:05:10.113
May look like
we have some company.

01:05:25.655 --> 01:05:27.134
( Door opens )

01:05:27.290 --> 01:05:28.894
Hey, man, don't shoot.
Don't shoot, okay?

01:05:29.058 --> 01:05:32.904
That's my kill. I did it.

01:05:33.062 --> 01:05:34.097
Oh, man.

01:05:34.264 --> 01:05:37.245
I'm infected, but it's pinkeye.

01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:39.311
All right?

01:05:39.469 --> 01:05:42.814
Oh, wait.
Damn, you guys are Navy SEALS.

01:05:42.972 --> 01:05:45.179
"Captain Phillips," Bin Laden.

01:05:45.341 --> 01:05:47.184
I mean, lam a big fan.

01:05:47.343 --> 01:05:48.651
My name's Larry.

01:05:48.812 --> 01:05:51.656
You know, I tried to sign up to be
one of you guys when I was younger,

01:05:51.815 --> 01:05:53.488
but my weight was a problem.

01:05:53.650 --> 01:05:55.994
- Billy: You don't say.
- ViviTech Lab, where is it?

01:05:56.152 --> 01:05:57.495
Oh, yeah, sure thing.

01:05:57.654 --> 01:06:00.191
Right this way, come on back.
It's safe.

01:06:03.927 --> 01:06:05.429
This way.

01:06:08.832 --> 01:06:11.176
Oh, man. ( Panting )

01:06:11.334 --> 01:06:13.678
You guys, oh, I tell ya...

01:06:13.837 --> 01:06:15.557
How'd you get caught up
in this mess anyway?

01:06:15.672 --> 01:06:17.777
- Eighth ﬂoor, right?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:06:17.941 --> 01:06:20.114
Oh, let's see.

01:06:21.511 --> 01:06:23.320
The place is crawling with 'em.

01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:25.517
They busted in a few hours ago.

01:06:25.682 --> 01:06:28.219
These security offices,
they're sealed off.

01:06:28.384 --> 01:06:30.295
Okay-

01:06:30.453 --> 01:06:32.899
So there's no infected in here.

01:06:33.056 --> 01:06:34.694
Okay-

01:06:34.858 --> 01:06:37.737
All right, well,
now this place is...

01:06:37.894 --> 01:06:41.535
it's wired for video, so I can show you
where you need to go.

01:06:41.698 --> 01:06:44.474
Say, why do you wanna go there
anyway?

01:06:44.634 --> 01:06:46.841
- Don't fucking worry about it.
- It's classified.

01:06:47.003 --> 01:06:48.744
It's classified.

01:06:48.905 --> 01:06:51.351
Not fucking worried about it.
You got it.

01:06:51.508 --> 01:06:55.513
Hey, can I catch a ride out of here
with you guys?

01:06:55.678 --> 01:06:58.420
Yeah, you get us where we need to go,
I'll make that happen.

01:06:59.816 --> 01:07:00.988
Okay-

01:07:01.150 --> 01:07:04.324
Now, the monitors down
by the lab.

01:07:04.487 --> 01:07:06.194
I don't have <i>access</i> to them.

01:07:06.356 --> 01:07:08.927
They're pretty strict
about their privacy.

01:07:09.092 --> 01:07:12.164
But this stairwell right here,

01:07:12.328 --> 01:07:15.207
that'll let you out
closest to the lab.

01:07:17.367 --> 01:07:19.074
Yeah, you got anything quieter?

01:07:20.837 --> 01:07:22.783
(sighs) Um...

01:07:22.939 --> 01:07:25.215
Well, the east stairwell,

01:07:25.375 --> 01:07:27.656
but that'll let you out
on the other side of the building.

01:07:27.744 --> 01:07:29.690
All right, it's better than being caught
in close quarters

01:07:29.846 --> 01:07:30.847
with one of those things.

01:07:31.014 --> 01:07:33.085
- You guys ready to move?
- Yes, sir.

01:07:33.249 --> 01:07:35.058
(thuds ) After you.

01:07:35.218 --> 01:07:36.595
Huh?

01:07:38.054 --> 01:07:39.692
We got your back.

01:07:39.856 --> 01:07:42.598
We got... we got your back, man.

01:07:42.759 --> 01:07:47.299
Well, in case I die, my mom's name
is Mary and my name's Larry.

01:08:25.602 --> 01:08:27.479
All right, guys,
they're everywhere.

01:08:27.636 --> 01:08:30.675
Let's go.
Stay tight on my back, okay?

01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:34.151
- Keep up the pace.
- Dave: I'm here, I'm here, I'm here.

01:08:34.310 --> 01:08:35.913
Your reporter here.

01:08:36.078 --> 01:08:38.519
This is something unbelievable.
Something I've never heard of.

01:08:38.648 --> 01:08:40.252
You have that gun, right?

01:08:40.416 --> 01:08:43.260
- What?
- The gun. You have the gun.

01:08:43.419 --> 01:08:45.660
Don't be afraid to use it,
okay?

01:08:45.822 --> 01:08:48.325
All right, happy feet,
these guys seem to travel in packs.

01:08:48.491 --> 01:08:50.163
They hear us, we're all dead.

01:08:50.326 --> 01:08:51.669
Stop.

01:08:51.828 --> 01:08:53.501
Oh, what are we gonna do?

01:08:53.662 --> 01:08:55.336
It's okay.

01:08:57.834 --> 01:08:59.176
Listen up.

01:08:59.335 --> 01:09:02.441
They're behind us and then that way.
Let's move this way. Come on.

01:09:10.113 --> 01:09:11.353
Let's go, happy feet.

01:09:11.514 --> 01:09:13.790
- Tightly.
- Dave, come on.

01:09:17.654 --> 01:09:20.294
Keep moving, keep it tight.
Come on.

01:09:20.456 --> 01:09:22.868
All right, listen up.

01:09:23.026 --> 01:09:26.029
They're surrounding us, okay?

01:09:26.194 --> 01:09:28.175
All right, let's cross.
Come on.

01:09:28.331 --> 01:09:29.742
(distant growling )

01:09:33.202 --> 01:09:36.081
Car! ' ( Gunshots)

01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:39.911
- Infected!
- ( Snarling )

01:09:43.645 --> 01:09:45.921
- Look out!
- ( Explosion )

01:10:01.931 --> 01:10:03.103
up, up, up!

01:10:03.266 --> 01:10:06.179
Let's go! Get up.
Move, move, move. Stay, stay.

01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:19.416
Right there, right there.

01:10:19.582 --> 01:10:21.619
Get down, down.

01:10:25.354 --> 01:10:27.698
( Snarling )

01:10:27.857 --> 01:10:30.030
- Put it down.
- Hey, careful with that.

01:10:30.193 --> 01:10:31.695
It only takes one of them
to see us.

01:10:31.861 --> 01:10:33.704
( Panting )
What are we gonna do now?

01:10:33.863 --> 01:10:36.275
We're gonna wait
for a safe opportunity to move out.

01:10:36.432 --> 01:10:37.467
What if there isn't one?

01:10:37.633 --> 01:10:39.977
I'm gonna send you out there
and see how long you last.

01:10:40.136 --> 01:10:42.776
This isn't funny. Why can't you just
shoot past these assholes?

01:10:42.939 --> 01:10:45.613
Bad tactics.
I only have so many bullets.

01:10:45.775 --> 01:10:48.255
We fight smart, we live.

01:10:48.411 --> 01:10:49.947
Until then, zip it, all right?

01:10:50.113 --> 01:10:52.821
- Typical American military dickhead.
- Jesus, Dave.

01:10:52.982 --> 01:10:54.655
What are you even doing here?
Shouldn't you be at a coffee shop

01:10:54.817 --> 01:10:57.297
- sipping on lattés, taking selfies?
- Okay, stop!

01:10:57.453 --> 01:10:59.228
He's keeping our asses alive

01:10:59.388 --> 01:11:02.267
and he risked his life
by staying with me to cover this story.

01:11:02.425 --> 01:11:04.268
The world needs to see
what happened out here

01:11:04.427 --> 01:11:06.588
and, you know what,
what's in this camera is priceless.

01:11:06.662 --> 01:11:09.802
You got a family?
Well, I don't, but I want one one day.

01:11:09.966 --> 01:11:12.167
I've got parents and a dog
that will be very heartbroken

01:11:12.301 --> 01:11:14.247
if I don't make it home.

01:11:14.403 --> 01:11:17.441
- ( Sighs)
- I'm married.

01:11:17.607 --> 01:11:19.951
Emily.
We have a son on the way.

01:11:20.109 --> 01:11:21.486
- And she's gonna be very pissed...
- (Footsteps )

01:11:21.644 --> 01:11:24.989
if I wind up a walking carcass
in Louisiana.

01:11:25.148 --> 01:11:26.991
I'll get us home.

01:11:34.690 --> 01:11:36.966
Oh! Hey, hey. Hey, little girl.

01:11:37.126 --> 01:11:38.969
- Oh, no.
- Hey. Hey, sweetie.

01:11:39.128 --> 01:11:40.528
Hey, no, no,
I'm not gonna hurt you.

01:11:40.630 --> 01:11:42.610
No, stay back.
Stay, stay back, stay back.

01:11:42.765 --> 01:11:45.143
- ( Panting )
- You gotta kill her.

01:11:45.301 --> 01:11:46.837
- No!
- I'm not killing a kid.

01:11:47.003 --> 01:11:48.880
Yeah, what difference does it make?
She's one of them.

01:11:49.038 --> 01:11:50.278
No, no, sweetie, sweetie,
stay right there.

01:11:50.439 --> 01:11:51.679
Look, my gun's down, okay?

01:11:51.841 --> 01:11:53.878
We're not gonna hurt you.

01:11:54.043 --> 01:11:56.083
What... what are you doing?
Have you lost your mind?

01:11:56.145 --> 01:11:57.146
- We have to kill her.
- No, we don't!

01:11:57.313 --> 01:11:59.486
- Look at me.
- It's either her or us.

01:11:59.649 --> 01:12:00.855
Hey, back! What are you doing?

01:12:01.017 --> 01:12:02.394
- ( Snarls )
- What are you... get back, dang it.

01:12:02.552 --> 01:12:04.725
- Ah, shit!
- Oh, my God!

01:12:04.887 --> 01:12:06.389
Grab my restraints.

01:12:06.556 --> 01:12:08.331
What can I... what do I do?

01:12:08.491 --> 01:12:10.801
- Tie her arms.
- Okay.

01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:12.640
- Here.
- Watch her mouth, watch her mouth!

01:12:12.795 --> 01:12:14.638
- Tie her arms.
- Oh, my God!

01:12:14.797 --> 01:12:16.208
She's trying to bite me.

01:12:16.365 --> 01:12:18.208
( Screams )
No, no, no, no. Okay.

01:12:18.367 --> 01:12:20.040
- Get her legs...
- I'm trying! She's...

01:12:20.203 --> 01:12:21.204
No, no, no.

01:12:21.370 --> 01:12:22.371
- Stay right there.
- She's trying to bite me.

01:12:22.538 --> 01:12:24.347
Come on, little girl,
come on, little girl.

01:12:24.507 --> 01:12:26.145
All right, Dave, move.
We're tying her.

01:12:27.410 --> 01:12:28.912
Move up, Dave. Tie her arms.

01:12:34.250 --> 01:12:37.197
( Snarling )

01:12:37.353 --> 01:12:38.889
( scanner beeps )

01:13:07.550 --> 01:13:09.029
Oh, shit.

01:13:09.185 --> 01:13:10.892
( Groans )

01:13:11.053 --> 01:13:13.363
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

01:13:13.522 --> 01:13:15.229
- Let me help.
- Wait here.

01:13:15.391 --> 01:13:18.065
- What can I do?
- Nothing, nothing, I'm fine.

01:13:19.962 --> 01:13:22.101
We gotta go, guys.
They're sealing off the city.

01:13:22.265 --> 01:13:25.075
We don't know if you have it.

01:13:25.234 --> 01:13:26.645
We'll see.

01:13:31.207 --> 01:13:34.120
- You know what to do if I am.
- No.

01:13:34.277 --> 01:13:35.813
Take it.

01:13:42.551 --> 01:13:44.121
Let's move.

01:14:00.736 --> 01:14:02.682
- ( Distant snaring )
- ( Girl screams)

01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:05.948
They're everywhere.

01:14:06.108 --> 01:14:07.143
You guys, make it
to that <i>crack</i> right now.

01:14:07.310 --> 01:14:09.085
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

01:14:15.318 --> 01:14:17.491
(whispers )
Hey, give me your phone.

01:14:17.653 --> 01:14:20.414
- ( Whispers ) It's not been working.
- ( Quietly )Just give it to me.

01:14:25.828 --> 01:14:29.833
( Touch tones beeping )

01:14:29.999 --> 01:14:32.946
( phone rings)

01:14:33.102 --> 01:14:34.103
Hello?

01:14:34.270 --> 01:14:36.011
Hey, baby.

01:14:36.172 --> 01:14:37.845
AJ.

01:14:38.007 --> 01:14:39.680
Yeah, it's me.

01:14:39.842 --> 01:14:42.015
Are you okay?
What... what's wrong?

01:14:42.178 --> 01:14:44.681
I'm fine.

01:14:44.847 --> 01:14:46.383
I just need you
to do something for me.

01:14:46.549 --> 01:14:47.687
Okay-

01:14:47.850 --> 01:14:50.194
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Hey, everything's okay.

01:14:50.353 --> 01:14:51.559
I just miss you.

01:14:51.721 --> 01:14:54.702
I need you to patch me through
to base.

01:14:54.857 --> 01:14:55.938
The number's on the fridge.

01:14:56.025 --> 01:14:58.733
- Okay.
- Look for JSOC operations.

01:14:58.894 --> 01:15:00.532
Okay-

01:15:00.696 --> 01:15:02.403
Okay, I see it.

01:15:02.565 --> 01:15:03.566
Hold on.

01:15:03.733 --> 01:15:05.838
Hey, Em?

01:15:06.002 --> 01:15:07.640
I love you.

01:15:15.511 --> 01:15:17.513
I love you, too.

01:15:19.482 --> 01:15:21.393
Come back home to me.

01:15:23.386 --> 01:15:27.061
( Touch tones beeping )

01:15:28.424 --> 01:15:31.268
( sobbing )

01:15:33.529 --> 01:15:36.601
( phone rings)

01:15:36.766 --> 01:15:38.507
- Ops.
- It's AJ.

01:15:38.667 --> 01:15:41.341
I'm separated from my team.
Heading to secondary target.

01:15:41.504 --> 01:15:42.608
Yes, I hear you. Hold, one.

01:15:42.772 --> 01:15:44.080
Sir, I have Petty Officer Prescott
on the line.

01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:45.640
Says he was separated
from the team.

01:15:45.674 --> 01:15:47.847
Is en route
through to secondary target.

01:15:48.010 --> 01:15:50.012
Tell him to hurry his ass up.

01:15:50.179 --> 01:15:51.659
They're shutting down
the airspace now

01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:53.682
and setting perimeters
around the city.

01:15:53.849 --> 01:15:56.853
Keep trying to raise the team.

01:15:57.019 --> 01:15:58.862
Soto: Proceed immediately
to secondary target.

01:15:59.021 --> 01:16:00.728
Roger that, roger that.

01:16:00.890 --> 01:16:03.097
We're on our way.
We'll get there as quick as possible.

01:16:03.259 --> 01:16:05.296
Copy that, over.

01:16:12.268 --> 01:16:13.269
All right, guys.

01:16:13.436 --> 01:16:14.642
We gotta hustle.

01:16:14.804 --> 01:16:16.147
We only got so much time.

01:16:16.305 --> 01:16:19.582
We need to go straight
for that street right there. Ready?

01:16:19.742 --> 01:16:22.621
On me. Let's go.
Move, move, move, move.

01:16:22.778 --> 01:16:25.452
( Panting )

01:16:27.283 --> 01:16:30.457
Hey, any of you guys got, like,
a snack cake or something?

01:16:30.619 --> 01:16:32.599
Get the fuck...

01:16:32.755 --> 01:16:34.132
I'm sorry.

01:16:35.891 --> 01:16:37.063
I'm sorry.

01:16:37.226 --> 01:16:39.331
( Door buzzes )

01:16:41.063 --> 01:16:42.406
Small room.

01:16:56.312 --> 01:16:58.349
( Door buzzes )

01:17:02.118 --> 01:17:04.155
We're a rescue team.
We're here to get you out.

01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:06.698
Pack up everything that you need
<i>as</i> quickly as possible.

01:17:06.856 --> 01:17:08.976
I just need to get the samples on ice
ready to travel.

01:17:09.024 --> 01:17:10.867
Wait, you have a cure for this?

01:17:11.026 --> 01:17:12.801
No, I don't think there is
a cure.

01:17:12.962 --> 01:17:14.402
We might be able to create
a vaccine.

01:17:14.430 --> 01:17:17.775
I think we can create that,
but we're gonna need a tissue sample

01:17:17.933 --> 01:17:20.345
- from one of them.
- ( Scoffs )

01:17:20.503 --> 01:17:21.982
- Jesus.
- ( Laughs )

01:17:22.138 --> 01:17:25.210
- This just keeps getting better. Sony.
- ( Chuckles )

01:17:27.343 --> 01:17:30.153
Pilot: Jackal actual,
we are on final approach, over.

01:17:33.782 --> 01:17:36.490
Jackal actual,
your team is not at the LZ.

01:17:43.526 --> 01:17:45.870
Sir, they are not at the LZ.

01:17:48.697 --> 01:17:49.869
Put 'em on a holding pattern.

01:17:50.032 --> 01:17:51.340
They stay until I say.

01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:54.344
Sir, they're shutting down the airspace
and implementing a complete lockdown.

01:17:54.503 --> 01:17:57.143
I don't give a damn.
They stay on station.

01:18:00.042 --> 01:18:01.043
Sir, we have a problem.

01:18:01.210 --> 01:18:03.212
We can't hold that mass off
on the other side.

01:18:06.916 --> 01:18:09.396
We got 45 seconds, best.

01:18:12.188 --> 01:18:15.067
- Where's our closest F-18?
- 60 seconds from target, sir.

01:18:15.224 --> 01:18:17.204
Call in a target acquisition.

01:18:17.359 --> 01:18:18.997
Tiger,
this is sky command post.

01:18:19.161 --> 01:18:21.903
Rally to target acquisition
at vector 0-4-0

01:18:22.064 --> 01:18:24.408
heading 2-6-8
at 8.4 nautical miles.

01:18:24.567 --> 01:18:25.739
Tiger, do you copy?

01:18:25.901 --> 01:18:30.350
Roger, attack position target
vector 04-0, over.

01:18:44.086 --> 01:18:47.090
Look at this, look at this.

01:18:47.256 --> 01:18:49.532
Target in sight, Colonel.

01:18:53.362 --> 01:18:57.139
We gotta blow this target
and you got one shot at it.

01:18:58.767 --> 01:19:00.246
Pilot:
Got a lock on target, sir.

01:19:00.402 --> 01:19:01.779
Sheer: Fire.

01:19:05.908 --> 01:19:08.752
- ( Explosion )
- Pilot: Target hit, sir.

01:19:08.911 --> 01:19:12.222
- ( Amanda whimpers)
- Fuck.

01:19:15.484 --> 01:19:16.656
We gotta move.

01:19:16.819 --> 01:19:20.289
Get up. Let's go.
We gotta get to the extraction point.

01:19:20.456 --> 01:19:23.232
Oh, my God, we're all gonna die.
It's unbelievable.

01:19:23.392 --> 01:19:25.303
What are you doing, sir?

01:19:26.662 --> 01:19:30.633
I'm cutting all access of infected
to the west.

01:19:30.799 --> 01:19:34.406
There are too many of our troops
to hold off condensed blockades

01:19:34.570 --> 01:19:36.140
from that mass of infected

01:19:36.305 --> 01:19:38.979
reaching the rest
of the western United States.

01:19:39.141 --> 01:19:41.644
That's what I'm doing.

01:19:46.815 --> 01:19:49.989
( Man screams )

01:19:50.152 --> 01:19:51.961
We gotta move.

01:19:52.121 --> 01:19:54.328
( Girl screams )

01:19:54.490 --> 01:19:56.333
Amanda,

01:19:56.492 --> 01:19:58.665
can you believe
what's happening?

01:20:00.029 --> 01:20:02.976
- Oh, my God, look. Get it.
- What?

01:20:04.300 --> 01:20:05.836
Oh, God.

01:20:10.673 --> 01:20:12.880
Oh, my God.

01:20:13.042 --> 01:20:15.147
- ( Snarls )
- ( Grunts, groans)

01:20:17.279 --> 01:20:20.351
( choking )

01:20:27.189 --> 01:20:29.635
- Dave! Dave!
- ( Gunshot )

01:20:32.961 --> 01:20:34.201
Dave!

01:20:34.363 --> 01:20:35.706
( Crying ) Oh, Dave. Oh, no.

01:20:35.864 --> 01:20:38.242
No, please.

01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:39.845
AJ!

01:20:40.002 --> 01:20:44.041
- ( Choking )
- No! AJ, please.

01:20:44.206 --> 01:20:45.981
AJ, we can't leave him
like this.

01:20:46.141 --> 01:20:47.245
- Amanda, we gotta keep moving.
- No!

01:20:47.409 --> 01:20:50.481
- No. AJ... what?
- Amanda, we gotta go!

01:20:50.646 --> 01:20:53.991
- Not like this.
- Here. Take it, let's go.

01:20:54.149 --> 01:20:56.686
Dave, I'm so sorry.

01:20:56.852 --> 01:20:58.695
( Snarling )

01:21:03.225 --> 01:21:05.705
Are you guys ready?

01:21:05.861 --> 01:21:06.862
(Sighs)

01:21:07.029 --> 01:21:09.310
This might be one
of the stupidest things we've ever done.

01:21:10.265 --> 01:21:13.439
( Banging on door)

01:21:15.571 --> 01:21:17.881
- ( gunshots)
- ( Snarling )

01:21:33.088 --> 01:21:35.864
Push it, push it.

01:21:36.024 --> 01:21:37.901
Clear! Clear!

01:21:40.095 --> 01:21:41.733
(gunshots)

01:21:49.738 --> 01:21:51.775
- It worked.
- ( Billy chuckles)

01:22:04.787 --> 01:22:06.733
They don't pay us enough.

01:22:18.634 --> 01:22:21.137
(distant snarling )

01:22:24.973 --> 01:22:26.316
Cunningham: Coming in.

01:22:33.916 --> 01:22:36.089
- Cunningham: How much longer?
- Doctor: Two minutes.

01:22:43.659 --> 01:22:45.832
Come on,
we don't have much time.

01:22:55.504 --> 01:22:57.006
Son of a bitch,
here's our vanilla.

01:22:57.172 --> 01:22:58.549
Guys.

01:23:00.642 --> 01:23:02.679
Got a visual on AJ.
He's in the parking lot.

01:23:05.380 --> 01:23:06.688
Must be another route
to get him.

01:23:06.849 --> 01:23:09.193
We'll have to shoot our way
to the extract.

01:23:09.351 --> 01:23:10.489
What's the fastest way
to the roof?

01:23:10.652 --> 01:23:12.461
Hold on. What about AJ?

01:23:12.621 --> 01:23:14.498
Let's go get him.

01:23:14.656 --> 01:23:17.193
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:23:17.359 --> 01:23:19.305
We got a mission to complete.

01:23:19.461 --> 01:23:21.805
We gotta get her back to base.

01:23:23.198 --> 01:23:24.404
And you are my medic.

01:23:24.566 --> 01:23:26.671
LT...

01:23:26.835 --> 01:23:28.314
I'm going to get him.

01:23:30.706 --> 01:23:32.242
We'll hold the chopper for you.

01:23:35.544 --> 01:23:37.490
We'll hold that chopper
for you.

01:23:41.550 --> 01:23:43.052
( Door opens )

01:23:43.218 --> 01:23:44.492
Ready?

01:23:44.653 --> 01:23:47.190
Let's go.

01:23:49.258 --> 01:23:52.535
Sir, we're being ordered
to evacuate the airspace.

01:23:53.896 --> 01:23:56.069
We can't hold them on station
any longer.

01:24:21.290 --> 01:24:24.271
Cunningham: Jackal actual,
this is Jackal 0-1, copy?

01:24:25.694 --> 01:24:28.038
Great to hear you, Jackal 0-1.

01:24:28.196 --> 01:24:30.608
We were about to leave you
high and dry.

01:24:30.766 --> 01:24:33.076
We have the lab team secure.

01:24:33.235 --> 01:24:35.909
I have two men
still in the building.

01:24:36.071 --> 01:24:37.948
You're probably gonna get
court-martialed

01:24:38.106 --> 01:24:40.609
for having to burn down
someone??

01:24:40.776 --> 01:24:43.120
We don't have time, Pete.

01:24:43.278 --> 01:24:44.916
Give me everything you can.

01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:46.616
They'll be here.

01:24:48.884 --> 01:24:51.125
Heard that one before.

01:24:53.455 --> 01:24:55.662
- ( Gunshots)
- ( Groans)

01:25:00.629 --> 01:25:02.666
AJ, come on!

01:25:02.831 --> 01:25:04.071
You're a sight for sore eyes.

01:25:04.232 --> 01:25:06.610
Don't be a sissy.
Get your ass inside.

01:25:10.238 --> 01:25:11.342
(door shuts)

01:25:15.744 --> 01:25:16.916
Missed you, bro.

01:25:17.079 --> 01:25:20.583
We got into
a little bit of trouble.

01:25:20.749 --> 01:25:22.160
I'm fine,

01:25:22.317 --> 01:25:23.819
I think.

01:25:23.986 --> 01:25:26.159
( Snarling )

01:25:29.124 --> 01:25:30.194
Shit.

01:25:30.359 --> 01:25:32.600
Get inside the building.

01:25:50.846 --> 01:25:53.224
Carl, we are at the LZ.

01:25:53.382 --> 01:25:56.363
I have the evac in sight.
What's your position?

01:25:59.988 --> 01:26:02.195
(distant growling )

01:26:09.231 --> 01:26:11.643

01:26:20.008 --> 01:26:21.214
AJ: Carl!

01:26:23.011 --> 01:26:24.490
Carl!

01:26:24.646 --> 01:26:26.216
Carl: Go on!

01:26:28.216 --> 01:26:30.093
Amanda: Go, go, go!

01:26:32.554 --> 01:26:35.000
Carl!

01:26:35.157 --> 01:26:37.933
Cunningham:
Carl, where are you?

01:26:40.896 --> 01:26:42.933
( Snarling )

01:26:46.768 --> 01:26:48.873
(yelling )

01:26:57.746 --> 01:26:59.350
(gunshot)

01:27:04.753 --> 01:27:07.427
We are on the roof.
We are on the LZ.

01:27:07.589 --> 01:27:09.296
What is your position?

01:27:09.458 --> 01:27:11.233
Carl: Headed to you.

01:27:11.393 --> 01:27:13.873
All right, hurry up.
I can't hold it for very much longer.

01:27:27.275 --> 01:27:28.754
Carl?

01:27:34.950 --> 01:27:36.258
Where's Carl?

01:27:38.053 --> 01:27:41.967
Carl, AJ is on the roof. Where are you?
What is your position?

01:27:44.059 --> 01:27:46.232
Carl, AJ is on the roof.

01:27:46.394 --> 01:27:47.998
What is your position?

01:27:48.163 --> 01:27:51.474
- Tell me where he is. I'll go get him.
- I don't have“ I don't have him.

01:27:54.136 --> 01:27:55.945
Carl: All good, man.

01:27:56.104 --> 01:27:58.983
They got me cornered.
There's too many of 'em. Stay safe.

01:27:59.141 --> 01:28:00.313
<i>LT.</i>

01:28:00.475 --> 01:28:02.819
Tell AJ to raise that kid of his
to be a badass.

01:28:02.978 --> 01:28:04.855
Cunningham: Carl, God damn it,
where are you?

01:28:05.013 --> 01:28:06.583
No, I'm going off comm.
Get home!

01:28:06.748 --> 01:28:08.421
Get home.

01:28:11.019 --> 01:28:12.828
Get everyone in the chopper.

01:28:14.823 --> 01:28:17.667
Go. Everybody
get on the chopper.

01:28:17.826 --> 01:28:19.703
Move.

01:28:31.006 --> 01:28:32.644
A couple shout-outs to make.

01:28:32.808 --> 01:28:35.186
Think it's what those kids
are calling it these days.

01:28:35.343 --> 01:28:38.347
Mom, Dad...

01:28:40.816 --> 01:28:42.727
I know I was a pain in the ass
growing up.

01:28:42.884 --> 01:28:45.364
But you guys, uh...
you guys took me in.

01:28:45.520 --> 01:28:47.397
You gave me a chance
when nobody else did.

01:28:47.556 --> 01:28:50.662
Because of you
lam the man I am today.

01:28:52.360 --> 01:28:53.964
Don't feel bad.

01:28:54.129 --> 01:28:56.575
It's actually a hell of a way
of going out.

( Banging on door)

01:28:57.966 --> 01:29:00.572
For all the men I've had
the pleasure to serve with.

01:29:00.735 --> 01:29:03.181
Boys,
it's been a hell of a ride.

01:29:13.148 --> 01:29:15.059
You too, AJ, go.

01:29:17.419 --> 01:29:19.592
I can't.

01:29:19.754 --> 01:29:21.097
What?

01:29:24.426 --> 01:29:25.564
- I can't.
- What?

01:29:25.727 --> 01:29:27.365
I've been bit.
LT, I've been bit.

01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:33.401
(gun cocks)

01:29:33.568 --> 01:29:36.048
(gunshots)

01:29:37.873 --> 01:29:40.410
Get on that fucking chopper
before I kick your fucking ass.

01:29:40.575 --> 01:29:41.713
Sir, we have our orders.

01:29:41.877 --> 01:29:44.255
I'm not gonna jeopardize
anyone else.

01:29:47.449 --> 01:29:48.928
Billy!

01:29:55.590 --> 01:29:57.536
AJ...

01:29:57.692 --> 01:30:01.139
says he ain't coming with us
'cause he's been bit.

01:30:01.296 --> 01:30:02.536
What are we gonna do?

01:30:02.697 --> 01:30:04.438
I guess we're stayin'.

01:30:04.599 --> 01:30:06.203
No, fuck! Get on the chopper!

01:30:06.368 --> 01:30:08.609
I can't go. I've been bit!

01:30:08.770 --> 01:30:12.445
Look... we already lost
Chief and Carl.

01:30:12.607 --> 01:30:15.383
We're not losing another guy.

01:30:15.543 --> 01:30:17.648
I'm not
leaving you behind again.

01:30:18.880 --> 01:30:20.120
Listen...

01:30:21.449 --> 01:30:23.326
Billy will keep an eye on you.

01:30:24.953 --> 01:30:27.900
If you start to change,
he will do what needs to be done.

01:30:28.056 --> 01:30:30.559
But if those scientists
have a cure,

01:30:30.725 --> 01:30:33.069
you're the first in line.

01:30:33.228 --> 01:30:34.901
Let's go home.

01:30:37.265 --> 01:30:38.642
Come on.

01:31:06.161 --> 01:31:08.334
( Explosions )

01:31:19.774 --> 01:31:22.812
I'd like to thank my fellow senators
for their participation

01:31:22.978 --> 01:31:25.390
in this bipartisan congressional
investigation.

01:31:25.547 --> 01:31:28.187
This classified hearing
is now in session.

01:31:28.350 --> 01:31:31.024
Our witness this morning
will hopefully shed light

01:31:31.186 --> 01:31:34.360
on our government's response
to this tragic incident.

01:31:34.522 --> 01:31:36.968
What our military
and government officials knew

01:31:37.125 --> 01:31:39.162
about this threat and when.

01:31:39.327 --> 01:31:43.332
I remind you that you are under oath,
Miss Thomas.

01:31:43.498 --> 01:31:45.705
I am happy to answer
any and all questions

01:31:45.867 --> 01:31:47.244
regarding the outbreak

01:31:47.402 --> 01:31:49.143
and to acknowledge
the brave men and women

01:31:49.304 --> 01:31:51.545
who risked and sacrificed
their lives.

01:31:51.706 --> 01:31:54.812
How would you rate our response
to this disaster?

01:31:54.976 --> 01:31:56.546
As with any new threat,

01:31:56.711 --> 01:31:58.349
mistakes were made.

01:31:58.513 --> 01:32:01.824
Lives unnecessarily lost.

01:32:01.983 --> 01:32:03.826
But the human race survives.

01:32:03.985 --> 01:32:07.523
The question is
how well will we do next time.

01:32:10.759 --> 01:32:14.400
I regret that Petty Officer McKnight
never knew that he had saved us.

01:32:14.562 --> 01:32:16.235
How do you mean?

01:32:16.398 --> 01:32:19.208
He knew that AJ
couldn't make it to the roof alone,

01:32:19.367 --> 01:32:21.711
so he stayed behind.

01:32:21.870 --> 01:32:24.214
Then they did what they had to.
They left McKnight for dead

01:32:24.372 --> 01:32:26.374
in order to complete
the mission.

01:32:26.541 --> 01:32:28.885
Only it wasn't
what the scientists had

01:32:29.044 --> 01:32:32.355
that had the answers.
It was AJ.

01:32:32.514 --> 01:32:34.050
When he didn't turn,

01:32:34.215 --> 01:32:36.058
we knew we had someone immune.

01:32:36.217 --> 01:32:38.026
Turns out they all were.

01:32:38.186 --> 01:32:41.065
How were they immune,
Miss Thomas?

01:32:41.222 --> 01:32:44.203
All five had had full-scale,

01:32:44.359 --> 01:32:46.771
intense seven-series shots.

01:32:48.063 --> 01:32:51.875
Sir, some type
of chemical change...

01:32:52.033 --> 01:32:54.741
happens in reaction
to the virus.

01:32:54.903 --> 01:32:58.544
The seven-series shots
changes the molecular structure

01:32:58.706 --> 01:32:59.980
of the protocol.

01:33:00.141 --> 01:33:04.055
We don't know how
or what changes it yet.

01:33:15.323 --> 01:33:18.395
Have you ever seen
such a hot preggo chick?

01:33:21.262 --> 01:33:22.900
AJ.

01:33:25.266 --> 01:33:26.472
Look at you.

01:33:28.937 --> 01:33:31.781
Man, I look so fat right now.

01:33:33.141 --> 01:33:35.018
You're damn beautiful
to me, babe.

01:33:35.176 --> 01:33:36.985
I'm tempted to rip your clothes off
right now,

01:33:37.145 --> 01:33:39.455
you have no idea.

01:33:39.614 --> 01:33:41.321
And you.

01:33:41.483 --> 01:33:43.087
( Sighs ) How's my boy?

01:33:43.251 --> 01:33:45.094
You gonna be big and strong
like your daddy?

01:33:45.253 --> 01:33:47.631
Yeah? What do you say, Carl?

01:33:51.626 --> 01:33:53.970
( Music playing )

01:36:42.096 --> 01:36:44.269
( music ends)

01:36:45.305 --> 01:36:51.312
