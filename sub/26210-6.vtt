00:04.233 --> 00:06.033
Tonight on <i>Total</i>
Divas...

00:06.033 --> 00:07.033
Miami!

00:07.033 --> 00:09.133
We come up with a
dance, and then we're gonna

00:09.133 --> 00:11.200
actually perform it at one of
the nightclubs tomorrow night.

00:11.200 --> 00:12.200
What?

00:12.200 --> 00:14.033
I throw people around.
I don't... dance.

00:14.033 --> 00:15.033
You don't d...?

00:15.033 --> 00:17.100
Will you three
support me if I do something to

00:17.100 --> 00:20.033
Lana? I think it's time to get a
little crazy in Miami.

00:20.033 --> 00:22.933
We are due for a prank.

00:22.933 --> 00:25.100
You guys see all those
paparazzi people?

00:25.100 --> 00:26.733
They want to see what
the you're doing to him.

00:26.733 --> 00:28.533
They want to see who
I'm gonna grind on.

00:28.533 --> 00:32.266
I'm just like, "Go find someone
else to bug."

00:41.833 --> 00:44.166
Ladies and
gentlemen, it is time now for

00:44.166 --> 00:47.633
one of the most exciting matches
in WWE.

00:47.633 --> 00:50.866
We welcome you tonight to <i>Monday</i>
Night Raw.

00:54.766 --> 00:56.600
Miami's gonna be so
much fun.

00:56.600 --> 00:58.400
We're doing Miami
tomorrow.

00:58.400 --> 01:00.040
Are you excited?
Miami's gonna be amazing.

01:00.040 --> 01:01.973
Why Miami?
Ugh.

01:01.973 --> 01:03.973
The twins, myself.
I think Miami's fun.

01:03.973 --> 01:05.806
It'll be nice.
I feel bad because you don't

01:05.806 --> 01:06.806
seem excited about it.

01:06.806 --> 01:08.806
I'm just...
You know what?

01:08.806 --> 01:10.606
I'm not really a big fan of
celebrating my birthday.

01:10.606 --> 01:13.373
If anything, I'd rather be home
in my new house that I have

01:13.373 --> 01:15.373
barely been in since I bought
it, you know?

01:15.373 --> 01:17.040
So, why would you
want to go home and enjoy

01:17.040 --> 01:18.040
anything in your life?

01:19.040 --> 01:20.040
I mean...

01:20.040 --> 01:21.040
I know.

01:21.040 --> 01:22.940
Why would I buy a house
if I just can't ever be in it?

01:22.940 --> 01:25.806
So... Even though I'd rather, you
know, lay low for my birthday,

01:25.806 --> 01:29.606
the girls planned this really
cool birthday, you know, trip

01:29.606 --> 01:31.440
for Nattie and I.
I guess I'm gonna have to look

01:31.440 --> 01:33.273
at the bright side of Miami.
It's gonna be insane.

01:33.273 --> 01:34.273
Yeah, it'll be fun.

01:34.273 --> 01:36.973
It's just, now that I'm
the Raw Women's Champion, you're

01:36.973 --> 01:38.506
going non‐stop.

01:38.506 --> 01:42.340
The irresistible
force, the women's champion.

01:42.340 --> 01:45.006
I just bought a home,
and I haven't even spent more

01:45.006 --> 01:47.706
than 24 hours in my own bed.

01:47.706 --> 01:49.806
The power of Nia
Jax!

01:49.806 --> 01:50.640
Love that. Awesome.

01:50.640 --> 01:51.640
Yeah.

01:51.640 --> 01:53.473
You look amazing, by
the way.

01:53.473 --> 01:54.473
Thank you.

drained, so, thank goodness we

02:51.513 --> 02:54.813
have this amazing space at this
amazing hotel because this is

02:54.813 --> 02:57.346
about to turn into a crazy party
week.

02:57.346 --> 03:00.320
I'm wide awake.
Just gonna take off my pants and

03:00.320 --> 03:02.720
sleep in this top.

03:10.453 --> 03:12.086
Stretching. Stretching.

03:12.086 --> 03:14.553
What's going on?
What are you doing?

03:14.553 --> 03:15.553
Oh, brother, so disgusting.

03:16.553 --> 03:20.853
Stop it. We're in Miami, bitch.
The girls had an idea that we're

03:20.853 --> 03:24.153
all going to give the girls
surprises for their birthday.

03:24.153 --> 03:26.820
So, Nat and Nia are in for
quite the treat.

03:26.820 --> 03:28.920
Where the did baggage
claim go?

03:30.820 --> 03:32.586
Everything smells really
good in here.

03:32.586 --> 03:33.420
Smells super clean. I like that.

03:33.420 --> 03:34.420
I like that, too.

03:34.420 --> 03:35.420
Um, good morning.

03:35.420 --> 03:36.420
Oh, you're awake.

03:36.420 --> 03:38.553
Brie!

03:38.553 --> 03:39.553
I missed you.

03:39.553 --> 03:40.553
Oh. Look so summery.

03:40.553 --> 03:41.553
Thank you.

03:41.553 --> 03:44.286
You look gorgeous.
We're in frickin' Miami.

03:44.286 --> 03:45.286
I know.

03:45.286 --> 03:48.120
Let's have some
breakfast. How about we eat?

03:48.120 --> 03:49.120
Is Nicole still sleeping?

03:49.120 --> 03:50.120
Yeah.

03:50.120 --> 03:55.820
Good, but I don't know
if I would... Hey. I miss you.

03:55.820 --> 03:57.720
I miss you, too. Oh.

03:57.720 --> 03:58.720
Nicole.

03:58.720 --> 04:00.293
Oh, you smell good.
You smell like cotton candy.

04:00.293 --> 04:01.293
Thank you.

04:01.293 --> 04:03.193
I can't wait to see
Paige and Lana.

04:07.093 --> 04:08.793
Your nipples are,
like, so hard.

04:08.793 --> 04:10.426
Well, one of 'em is.
One of them's so hard right now.

04:10.426 --> 04:11.426
They look good.

04:11.426 --> 04:12.393
Really? Oh.

04:12.393 --> 04:13.060
Really good.

04:13.060 --> 04:14.293
Should I make the other
one hard?

04:14.293 --> 04:18.093
They're Miami‐ready.
Brandon, there you are.

04:18.093 --> 04:21.093
Hi, hot stuff. Get over here.
How are you?

04:21.093 --> 04:22.093
No, bring it in. I love hugs.

04:22.093 --> 04:23.093
I love your accent.

04:23.093 --> 04:26.026
Oh, my God, I love
your face. Come on.

04:26.026 --> 04:28.493
The first surprise is here, and
it's Brandon.

04:28.493 --> 04:31.526
He's hired to be our personal
bartender.

04:31.526 --> 04:34.393
He's a random young dude that I
found off a modeling website.

04:34.393 --> 04:36.393
But you know what?
It's Miami, so you might as well

04:36.393 --> 04:41.060
just live in the Miami spirit.
Hi, ladies!

04:41.060 --> 04:42.626
Ooh! The Bellas are here, too!

04:42.626 --> 04:43.626
Hello.

04:43.626 --> 04:45.426
I didn't realize you
were here yet.

04:45.426 --> 04:47.226
He's got really good bartender
skills, so, please.

04:47.226 --> 04:49.026
Oh, really?
Oh, you're a bartender?

04:49.026 --> 04:50.826
Let's take a shot,
guys.

04:50.826 --> 04:52.226
Make sure when you
pop it, you go up like this.

04:52.226 --> 04:53.460
You're gonna do a
shotgun?

04:53.460 --> 04:54.760
Pop and go.

04:54.760 --> 04:55.426
At the same time?

04:55.426 --> 04:57.593
Yeah. Go.
Other way. The beer's...

04:57.593 --> 04:58.593
Other way.

05:00.600 --> 05:01.400
So I do it this way.

05:01.400 --> 05:03.066
The other way, yeah.
You're fine. It's just you did

05:03.066 --> 05:04.666
the opposite way.

05:04.666 --> 05:07.033
Rookie mistake.

05:07.033 --> 05:08.833
One, two. Go!

05:08.833 --> 05:09.833
Go!

05:11.600 --> 05:12.600
Yeah.

05:12.600 --> 05:14.400
I felt like I was
drowning.

05:14.400 --> 05:15.400
Yeah.

05:16.400 --> 05:18.633
I'm so excited to
celebrate Nattie's birthday and

05:18.633 --> 05:21.800
celebrate Nia's birthday, and
that's just gonna be so much fun.

05:21.800 --> 05:22.800
I'm stoked.

05:22.800 --> 05:23.800
She's killing it.

05:23.800 --> 05:24.800
Nailed it!

05:25.800 --> 05:26.800
Damn.

05:26.800 --> 05:28.600
What does everyone want
to do?

05:28.600 --> 05:30.500
I just got off a
plane, so I feel like I just

05:30.500 --> 05:31.166
want to take a shower.

05:31.166 --> 05:32.766
Why don't we just
decompress and put on whatever

05:32.766 --> 05:33.766
we want?

05:33.766 --> 05:36.700
Nattie and Nia, so you
guys know, in the next few days

05:36.700 --> 05:40.666
we have a lot of surprises for
you girls that we're gonna be...

05:40.666 --> 05:42.800
You know, it's gonna be
happening in and out, so...

05:42.800 --> 05:44.800
It's gonna be birthday
wars.

05:44.800 --> 05:46.633
It is. It's like
birthday wars.

05:46.633 --> 05:49.600
Birthday wars?
Who's gonna be the winner?

05:49.600 --> 05:50.966
You got a plan?

05:50.966 --> 05:51.966
Um, yeah.

05:53.300 --> 05:55.900
Perfect, and we'll all
regroup here in a bit.

05:55.900 --> 05:57.533
Yeah.

05:57.533 --> 05:59.600
You didn't tell me that
there were surprises this

05:59.600 --> 06:00.540
weekend.

06:00.540 --> 06:01.540
Yeah, I did.

06:01.540 --> 06:02.540
No, you did not.

06:02.540 --> 06:03.540
I swear I did.

06:03.540 --> 06:05.540
Well, I don't have a
surprise.

06:05.540 --> 06:07.540
Everyone was on the
group text.

06:07.540 --> 06:09.373
You definitely forgot
to add me on that.

06:09.373 --> 06:11.173
I did not forget to
add you.

06:11.173 --> 06:13.973
So now I'm freaking out
because how am I going to put

06:13.973 --> 06:16.840
together a surprise for Nattie
and Nia in Miami?

06:16.840 --> 06:19.440
I do have mommy brain, so maybe
she told me, but I don't know

06:19.440 --> 06:21.873
what to do.
Like, this is stuff you have to

06:21.873 --> 06:25.106
plan weeks before.

06:25.106 --> 06:29.573
Where am I going?
Hello! What's happening? Anyone?

06:29.573 --> 06:31.373
You're in this room,
babe.

06:31.373 --> 06:32.373
Got it.

06:32.373 --> 06:34.340
Got it? You got it.

06:34.340 --> 06:38.173
I always get the bad
room! They always give me the bad

06:38.173 --> 06:39.773
view.

06:39.773 --> 06:43.306
Soak it in, bitches!

06:43.306 --> 06:47.373
What? Yeah, girl.
Bring that wind in.

06:47.373 --> 06:48.306
Yay!

06:54.173 --> 06:56.006
Gosh, isn't it crazy
how saggy my titties are now?

06:56.006 --> 06:57.006
Geez.

06:57.006 --> 06:59.440
Whatever, dude.
You're a mom.

06:59.440 --> 07:01.746
Brie. Yeah.
Think of BirBir.

07:01.746 --> 07:02.946
You gave BirBir food.

07:02.946 --> 07:05.213
Yeah, she wipes me out.

07:05.213 --> 07:07.213
There's somebody taking
a picture of us right now.

07:07.213 --> 07:09.213
He's right there. He's, like...
Now he's on the phone.

07:09.213 --> 07:11.046
He's acting like he's just on
the phone.

07:11.046 --> 07:12.846
And then he's like,
"Oh, my God, that's probably,

07:12.846 --> 07:15.380
like, paps or something, right?"
Nikki's here with a bunch of

07:15.380 --> 07:16.380
dudes.

07:16.380 --> 07:19.180
Yeah.
The media's just been more

07:19.180 --> 07:23.346
involved in my life, and it just
doesn't make me feel good inside.

07:23.346 --> 07:25.180
They were all trying to call my
phone yesterday.

07:25.180 --> 07:26.713
What the, dude?

07:26.713 --> 07:27.713
Get out of here!

07:27.713 --> 07:29.813
I feel like I can't
escape.

07:29.813 --> 07:32.546
Like, I feel like a prisoner,
like I just have no freedom.

07:32.546 --> 07:33.846
No. No.

07:33.846 --> 07:34.846
Beat it!

07:34.846 --> 07:39.513
Off!

07:39.513 --> 07:43.380
Happy birthday!

07:43.380 --> 07:45.746
These surprises were
out of control.

07:45.746 --> 07:47.846
I can't even imagine what the
other ones are.

07:47.846 --> 07:49.713
Will you three
support me if I do something to

07:49.713 --> 07:53.846
Lana?
I'm really feeling mischievous.

07:53.846 --> 07:56.013
Happy birthday!

07:56.013 --> 07:57.046
You!

07:57.046 --> 07:58.880
Oh, my God, they're
everywhere.

07:58.880 --> 08:01.386
The paparazzi are
hounding us everywhere we are

08:01.386 --> 08:02.386
going.

08:02.386 --> 08:05.645
Do your thing.
You be how you want to be.

08:14.553 --> 08:17.553
Oh, can I have a...?
I kind of want another shot.

08:17.553 --> 08:18.553
How's that? How's that?

08:18.553 --> 08:20.386
You want another
one?

08:20.386 --> 08:22.453
I would love another
one.

08:22.453 --> 08:24.186
Wait. You should take a shot.

08:24.186 --> 08:25.186
All right.

08:25.186 --> 08:26.586
To our living our best
life.

08:26.586 --> 08:28.453
Yeah.

08:28.453 --> 08:31.920
Okay.
Keep that smile on. Oh...

08:31.920 --> 08:33.753
Shouldn't we take a
break?

08:33.753 --> 08:35.320
Can you take a shot
with me, Paige, because I'm...

08:35.320 --> 08:36.320
I'm on my way?

08:36.320 --> 08:37.852
No.

08:37.852 --> 08:39.919
Oh, am I going to see
Brie mode this weekend?

08:39.919 --> 08:40.919
I've never seen Brie mode.

08:40.919 --> 08:41.919
You haven't?

08:41.919 --> 08:42.919
No.

08:42.919 --> 08:46.020
It gets pretty out of
control.

08:46.020 --> 08:48.553
But it's not Lana
out‐of‐control.

08:48.553 --> 08:49.553
Jell‐O shots!

08:49.553 --> 08:50.553
You want...?

08:50.553 --> 08:51.753
Jell‐O shots!

08:51.753 --> 08:52.753
Lana!

08:52.753 --> 08:54.653
Lana!

08:54.653 --> 08:55.653
I...

08:55.653 --> 08:59.493
♪ To living our best
life! ♪

08:59.493 --> 09:00.326
What's going on, Lana?

09:00.326 --> 09:02.193
Rus... No, I was...
We were gonna take fireball

09:02.193 --> 09:03.660
shots.
We were talking about how he

09:03.660 --> 09:05.260
wants to have a modeling and
acting career here in Miami.

09:05.260 --> 09:06.193
I am a model.

09:06.193 --> 09:07.193
Oh, nice.

09:07.193 --> 09:08.393
How old are you?

09:08.393 --> 09:09.393
Me? I'm 21.

09:09.393 --> 09:10.393
Oh, my God.

09:10.393 --> 09:11.393
21?

09:11.393 --> 09:12.393
Yeah.

09:12.393 --> 09:14.726
But, I mean, you are a
baby.

09:14.726 --> 09:15.993
Not really.

09:15.993 --> 09:18.260
I'm 34, gonna be 35.

09:18.260 --> 09:20.926
See, but when I go
to the club, it's different,

09:20.926 --> 09:21.926
'cause I can get with people...

09:21.926 --> 09:22.960
Oh, is that so?

09:22.960 --> 09:24.793
...that are, uh,
older than me.

09:24.793 --> 09:26.393
Oh, yeah, but I don't
even go to the club anymore.

09:26.393 --> 09:27.160
Yeah, I figured.

09:27.160 --> 09:28.693
Oh, what do you mean
you figured?

09:28.693 --> 09:29.993
I mean, aren't you
married?

09:29.993 --> 09:30.993
No, I'm not married.

09:30.993 --> 09:32.826
Oh.

09:32.826 --> 09:34.660
What's wrong?
Do you want to go outside?

09:34.660 --> 09:36.493
No, I need French
fries.

09:36.493 --> 09:42.393
So Brie mode is having
to forfeit to Mommy mode, and I

09:42.393 --> 09:46.193
guess now I have to continue my
mommy duties here in Miami.

09:46.193 --> 09:49.193
Can you do one cheese pizza, one
pepperoni pizza?

09:49.193 --> 09:51.593
So I got a bunch of French
fries, chicken tenders, club

09:51.593 --> 09:53.126
sandwich, pizza.

09:53.126 --> 09:55.126
Nattie, I want to talk
to you, seriously.

09:57.660 --> 09:58.660
Did you get it on

09:58.660 --> 10:00.066
camera?

10:00.066 --> 10:02.566
She walked straight into
glass door.

10:02.566 --> 10:03.566
That was crazy.

10:03.566 --> 10:06.066
Did you get that on
camera?

10:06.066 --> 10:08.500
I'm not wasted.
I'm a little tipsy, guys.

10:08.500 --> 10:10.633
Okay, so no more
alcohol for you.

10:10.633 --> 10:12.533
Why am I becoming the more
responsible one?

10:12.533 --> 10:14.966
I don't like this. This is weird.

10:22.600 --> 10:23.800
Lana, are you human?

10:23.800 --> 10:26.566
I don't know.
Sometimes I wonder what.

10:26.566 --> 10:29.466
Let's go, bitches!

10:29.466 --> 10:32.466
I have a surprise for
you guys. Come with me.

10:32.466 --> 10:37.400
Happy birthday!

10:37.400 --> 10:39.400
We're not all gonna fit
in there, Lana.

10:39.400 --> 10:41.400
Oh, it's really for...
It's for Nia and Nattie.

10:41.400 --> 10:42.400
Lana, thank you.

10:42.400 --> 10:45.066
Happy birthday.

10:45.066 --> 10:48.600
A Lamborghini.
I literally thought these

10:48.600 --> 10:51.700
surprises were gonna be very,
like, sentimental and just

10:51.700 --> 10:54.133
something very low‐key.
These are, like, out of control.

10:54.133 --> 10:56.366
I can't even imagine what the
other ones are.

10:56.366 --> 10:57.366
Happy birthday!

10:58.600 --> 11:00.640
Wait, wait.
Hold on, bitch. Let me...

11:00.640 --> 11:03.373
Happy birthday, girls!
Hope you‐you like your

11:03.373 --> 11:04.173
Lamborghini.

11:04.173 --> 11:05.573
Okay, I'm gonna
drive.

11:05.573 --> 11:06.773
All right, watch out.

11:06.773 --> 11:07.773
Get it, girl.

11:07.773 --> 11:09.606
, my car at
home is more than this.

11:09.606 --> 11:13.873
I'm so joking. I'm joking, Nia.

11:14.973 --> 11:17.540
Oh, my God, this is a
Lamborghini. Don't it up.

11:17.540 --> 11:18.540
Yeah.

11:32.206 --> 11:33.206
Is it, really?

11:33.206 --> 11:33.873
Yeah.

11:33.873 --> 11:37.240
Dude, this is as much as
my house.

11:37.240 --> 11:39.773
Nattie!

11:46.499 --> 11:48.284
Lambo. What, what?

11:49.806 --> 11:53.640
The Lamborghini is not
even gonna compare to the second

11:53.640 --> 11:56.973
surprise I have in store for
them tonight.

11:56.973 --> 11:59.106
So, this is my surprise for Nia
and Nattie.

11:59.106 --> 12:00.513
I rented out this whole place.

12:00.513 --> 12:01.546
Oh, my God!

12:01.546 --> 12:04.880
Thank you.
Paige, is this...

12:04.880 --> 12:05.713
No!

12:05.713 --> 12:08.113
All I saw was an ad
for naked sushi, and I just

12:08.113 --> 12:09.746
assumed that it would be us
taking our clothes off.

12:12.480 --> 12:13.280
So...

12:13.280 --> 12:14.846
All right, great.

12:15.946 --> 12:16.913
But he's breathing.

12:16.913 --> 12:18.780
He is. But, I mean,
they don't just put a dead body

12:18.780 --> 12:19.646
on the table.

12:20.946 --> 12:25.380
You are very nicely shaved.
My legs aren't even that shaven.

12:25.380 --> 12:29.380
He's just, like,
butt‐ass naked with his bare ass

12:29.380 --> 12:32.313
on this table and is, like‐‐ his
dick covered with, like, a

12:32.313 --> 12:32.980
little leaf.

12:32.980 --> 12:34.413
And I feel so bad for

12:34.413 --> 12:38.013
him, because we all don't want
to go near him.

12:38.013 --> 12:43.880
Like, we're all just creeped out.
Hey, buddy. Can you talk to us?

12:43.880 --> 12:46.646
Being naked on a sushi
table.

12:46.646 --> 12:47.513
First time.

12:47.513 --> 12:48.446
First time?

12:48.446 --> 12:49.780
Is this your first time?

12:49.780 --> 12:52.446
Paige, you better be
paying him very well.

12:52.446 --> 12:54.980
So lame.
Aw, he's holding the chopsticks.

12:54.980 --> 12:56.046
Aw!

12:56.046 --> 12:58.880
Thank goodness I'm a
vegetarian and I don't eat fish,

12:58.880 --> 13:02.086
'cause all the fish for the
girls is laying on the naked man.

13:02.086 --> 13:05.686
It looks like a disaster.
I could do way better than this.

13:05.686 --> 13:06.853
It's my birthday.

13:07.620 --> 13:08.886
Happy birthday.

13:08.886 --> 13:12.220
Oof, not my type of...
surprise.

13:12.220 --> 13:13.720
Nattie's just going
for it.

13:13.720 --> 13:15.620
She's picking up the sushi near
his crotch area.

13:15.620 --> 13:19.553
But the poor guy is sweating
profusely all over our sushi,

13:19.553 --> 13:23.153
and, um, he looks scared.
Seriously, I feel like this is a

13:23.153 --> 13:25.120
terrible situation.
We should probably, like, let

13:25.120 --> 13:25.853
him go.

13:25.853 --> 13:28.386
I'm thinking though
maybe just‐‐ we sit at a table

13:28.386 --> 13:30.053
and have drinks and we...

13:30.053 --> 13:31.220
Should we invite him?

13:31.220 --> 13:34.053
Move the‐the human
sushi off our table.

13:34.053 --> 13:34.753
Yes.

13:43.020 --> 13:44.186
Hi there.

13:44.186 --> 13:45.320
Can we get some water?

13:45.320 --> 13:46.786
Whose birthday
is it?

13:46.786 --> 13:47.920
It's her birthday.

13:47.920 --> 13:50.820
It's her birthday.

13:50.820 --> 13:52.720
Well, enjoy your
birthday.

13:52.720 --> 13:53.520
Thank you.

13:53.520 --> 13:54.686
Water.

13:54.686 --> 13:57.020
It's actually really
sweet.

13:57.020 --> 13:59.626
Welcome to Miami.

13:59.626 --> 14:01.226
So, your next
surprise... I'm just kidding.

14:01.226 --> 14:02.626
You guys want to go
back and get a drink at the

14:02.626 --> 14:03.293
hotel?

14:03.293 --> 14:03.960
Yeah.

14:03.960 --> 14:04.626
Yeah.

14:04.626 --> 14:08.793
♪ Oh, na, na, na
Oh, na, na, na, hey

14:08.793 --> 14:09.893
Oh, na, na, na. ♪

14:09.893 --> 14:11.526
I kind of just want to
go to bed.

14:11.526 --> 14:12.193
Go to bed.

14:12.193 --> 14:13.560
You guys gonna have a
drink?

14:13.560 --> 14:14.960
I'm gonna have a
drink.

14:14.960 --> 14:16.093
Yeah, I'll do a drink.

14:16.093 --> 14:16.760
Okay.

14:16.760 --> 14:18.226
I'm going to go to the
room.

14:18.226 --> 14:19.093
See you guys.

14:19.093 --> 14:21.760
Love you.
Come here, boo.

14:21.760 --> 14:22.426
Thank you.

14:22.426 --> 14:24.360
I wonder if I should
just make this a cheat day and

14:24.360 --> 14:26.893
look at their dessert menu.
I've been so bad today that...

14:26.893 --> 14:28.226
eff it.

14:28.226 --> 14:30.293
You're in Miami.
Eff it.

14:33.193 --> 14:33.860
Yay!

14:33.860 --> 14:34.993
Yay!

14:34.993 --> 14:37.593
Paige, no offense,
you took us to one of the worst

14:37.593 --> 14:39.460
places I've ever been to in my
whole life.

14:39.460 --> 14:41.660
Your heart was in the right
place, but thank God you

14:41.660 --> 14:42.693
redeemed yourself.

14:42.693 --> 14:45.226
You even made Lana
sober.

14:47.293 --> 14:51.060
Well, cheers to that, ladies.
We‐we made Lana go to sleep.

14:51.060 --> 14:52.060
Yeah.

14:53.060 --> 14:54.926
That's how bad the place was.

14:54.926 --> 14:55.926
Paige.

14:55.926 --> 14:56.693
What?

14:56.693 --> 14:57.393
Look at me.

14:57.393 --> 15:00.033
I'm lookin' at ya.
You‐‐ That vein is popping out.

15:00.033 --> 15:01.366
That means you mean business
right now.

15:02.366 --> 15:04.033
Will you three
support me if I do something to

15:04.033 --> 15:04.700
Lana?

15:04.700 --> 15:06.033
Wait, what are you
gonna do?

15:06.033 --> 15:07.600
We'll support you if
you do something to Lana.

15:07.600 --> 15:08.266
What is it?

15:08.266 --> 15:10.100
First of all, I think
she'd love the attention.

15:10.100 --> 15:11.900
I would like to take a little
bit of whipped cream or rough

15:11.900 --> 15:12.966
her up a bit.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.533
Oh, I would love to
film this.

15:15.533 --> 15:17.900
I mean, my first thing,
I think of is like, "This will

15:17.900 --> 15:19.766
be hilarious."
My second thing, as a mom, feels

15:19.766 --> 15:21.833
bad.
She needs sleep because she went

15:21.833 --> 15:22.500
hard all day.

15:22.500 --> 15:24.666
Sock it. Sock it with
that mum bull.

15:25.966 --> 15:27.966
I'm really feeling
mischievous.

15:27.966 --> 15:31.266
And I think it's time to get a
little crazy in Miami.

15:31.266 --> 15:35.033
We are due for a prank, and I
think Lana is the perfect

15:35.033 --> 15:38.833
recipient of a good,
old‐fashioned prank.

15:38.833 --> 15:40.100
We are by a kitchen.

15:40.100 --> 15:42.466
I mean, I'm not gonna
lie‐‐ I would love to spectate.

15:42.466 --> 15:47.266
Sorry to bother you.
We need a little whipped cream.

15:47.266 --> 15:48.233
Thank you.

15:48.233 --> 15:50.233
Yeah.
Go on. Bring it over.

15:50.233 --> 15:51.466
Perfect.

15:51.466 --> 15:54.533
Yeah.
We have to have a little bit of

15:54.533 --> 15:56.566
chocolate, just so she can taste
the dessert.

15:56.566 --> 15:57.533
Yeah.

15:57.533 --> 16:00.973
It is Nattie's
birthday, and what she wants,

16:00.973 --> 16:04.306
she gets.
I don't necessarily believe Lana

16:04.306 --> 16:07.040
deserves it...

16:07.040 --> 16:09.040
it, yes, she does.

16:09.040 --> 16:12.173
The minute we get into
the place, we all quietly take

16:12.173 --> 16:14.373
off our shoes.

16:20.206 --> 16:22.773
Since we're doing,
like, the whole birthday wars,

16:22.773 --> 16:25.373
we come up with a dance and then
we're gonna actually perform it

16:25.373 --> 16:26.706
at one of the nightclubs
tomorrow night.

16:26.706 --> 16:28.573
Brandon, I want to take
a shot.

16:28.573 --> 16:29.440
Liquid courage for this dancing

16:30.273 --> 16:32.773
It's the last day in
Miami, and we have this hot

16:32.773 --> 16:35.073
hired bartender.
Brandon, come talk to me real

16:35.073 --> 16:36.206
close.

16:37.906 --> 16:41.387
Am I making you embarrassed,
Brandon?

16:46.540 --> 16:50.306
So, the minute we get
into the place, we all quietly

16:50.306 --> 16:55.106
take off our shoes.
I'm starting to feel like we're

16:55.106 --> 16:57.573
in this <i>Mission: Impossible</i>
movie.

16:57.573 --> 17:02.846
Operation Prank Lana is a go.
I just got nervous.

17:06.346 --> 17:10.012
Lana. Lana.

Are you okay?

17:41.646 --> 17:44.180
I feel like she's
gonna attack me.

17:44.180 --> 17:45.680
No, she's‐‐ It's like...

17:46.913 --> 17:49.246
it's like the gremlin got wet.

17:49.246 --> 17:51.246
You tripped up so
hard.

17:51.246 --> 17:53.946
It's okay. My kneecap
is broken, but...

17:53.946 --> 17:56.780
Literally, I don't even
know where I am right now.

17:56.780 --> 17:59.353
They throw whipped cream on me,
screaming "happy birthday."

17:59.353 --> 18:01.020
My birthday was three months ago.

18:01.020 --> 18:03.286
She is not happy.
I wouldn't be.

18:03.286 --> 18:05.453
Since I've been woken
up, that's fine.

18:05.453 --> 18:07.220
I mean, we could‐‐ two of us can
play this game.

18:07.220 --> 18:12.353
I'm gonna go take a shower and...
it's on, bitch.

18:13.553 --> 18:14.853
I slipped and pissed.

18:16.820 --> 18:18.820
It's on the
ceiling.

18:18.820 --> 18:20.420
I feel bad.
I feel like she's mad at me.

18:20.420 --> 18:21.586
Of course she is.

18:28.353 --> 18:29.520
Sorry.

18:30.986 --> 18:35.886
No, stop it. Everybody get
focused.

18:35.886 --> 18:39.786
Lana, we're so sorry.
But, I mean, Lana looked

18:39.786 --> 18:41.420
beautiful during the whole thing.

18:42.620 --> 18:46.420
Being with all these women, I
laugh so hard around 'em.

18:46.420 --> 18:49.220
And, honestly, that's what life
is about. It's about friendships.

18:49.220 --> 18:50.853
I just really needed fun.

18:50.853 --> 18:52.520
I'm gonna get my pj's
on.

18:52.520 --> 18:59.026
Do you need to sleep
after some Lana pranking?

18:59.026 --> 19:03.126
Oh, thank you.
I'm sorry for that. I apologize.

19:03.126 --> 19:04.793
That girl wet the bed.

19:04.793 --> 19:06.060
Yeah, Nattie.

19:07.093 --> 19:08.960
I didn't realize it
was gonna go this far.

19:08.960 --> 19:10.993
In all honesty
though, we were just playing.

19:10.993 --> 19:13.660
- Lana loves that kind of stuff.
- She gets off on it.

19:17.493 --> 19:21.960
I'm the best prankster
out there. Ha‐ha! Kadesh.

19:21.960 --> 19:25.960
Living your best life,
mother! A banana?

19:25.960 --> 19:27.460

Which, I'm gonna give

20:52.066 --> 20:53.933
And I sent her a text this
morning saying, "I love you."

20:53.933 --> 20:54.666
Oh, good.

20:54.666 --> 20:56.266
Yeah. Because I do
love Lana.

Yeah.

Oh, my gosh.

21:01.706 --> 21:03.973
100%.
Nattie had me dying laughing at

21:03.973 --> 21:05.173
the sushi restaurant.

21:05.173 --> 21:05.906
Oh, my gosh.

21:05.906 --> 21:07.573

little leaf on him.

21:07.573 --> 21:09.240

hanging out.

21:10.906 --> 21:12.973

I saw the pubic hair.

21:12.973 --> 21:15.540
Seriously, that was‐‐ mm‐mm‐‐
ou‐out of all the birthday

21:15.540 --> 21:17.773
surprises, that's definitely not
my favorite.

21:17.773 --> 21:19.973
You guys were like,
"I can't wait to see it."

21:19.973 --> 21:21.506
Good morning, sunshine.

21:21.506 --> 21:23.073
Good morning,
beautiful.

21:23.073 --> 21:26.373
I'm so happy you got
sleep. I just woke up right now.

21:26.373 --> 21:27.373
Give me a hug.

21:27.373 --> 21:28.773
I heard what they did to
you.

21:28.773 --> 21:29.440
I know.

21:29.440 --> 21:30.806
Give me a hug, you
little wombat.

21:30.806 --> 21:33.506
I sent that video to
Rusev, and he said, "That's

21:33.506 --> 21:35.006
really up."

21:35.006 --> 21:36.840
So is he gonna get back
Nattie?

21:36.840 --> 21:38.306
Yeah.

21:44.540 --> 21:46.540
Nia, what can I make
you for lunch?

21:46.540 --> 21:49.306
We have pizza, chicken fingers,
salad, um...

21:49.306 --> 21:51.306
Can I have a little bit
of salad and some chicken

21:51.306 --> 21:54.106
fingers? Thank you so much, Mom.
Brie, you totally mommed me

21:54.106 --> 21:54.773
right now.

21:54.773 --> 21:55.440
No.

up a little.

You know who I love so
much? Kathy is the best.

21:59.713 --> 22:01.946
She wished me a happy birthday
yesterday, and I wanted to cry.

22:01.946 --> 22:03.946
I'm thinking like, "You do not
even have to do that."

22:03.946 --> 22:06.680
She's the best.
She loves all of you guys.

22:06.680 --> 22:08.746
Like, she just feels like you
guys are all her daughters.

22:08.746 --> 22:10.980
When was the last time you guys
saw your moms?

22:10.980 --> 22:13.380
I haven't seen my mom in
two months and...

22:13.380 --> 22:14.380
Two months?

22:14.380 --> 22:16.213
I really don't want to
talk about it 'cause it'll make

22:16.213 --> 22:19.346
me cry. I love my mom.
My mom is my world.

22:19.346 --> 22:22.346
My mom and I are extremely close.
I can never talk about her

22:22.346 --> 22:24.346
without crying because I've been
a little homesick.

22:24.346 --> 22:26.346
My schedule has just been
crazier and crazier.

to just fly home and visit.

WrestleMania in a singles match,
and I'm gonna go down in the

Like, it's a great thing, but

22:43.180 --> 22:46.313
it's also really taxing.
So I'm really happy that, you

22:46.313 --> 22:48.980
know, I get to be around all the
girls for my birthday, but I

22:48.980 --> 22:51.646

She's over here.
And this is Brinn Nicole.

24:14.807 --> 24:17.074
Since we're doing,
like, the whole birthday wars,

24:17.074 --> 24:20.507
what I thought was they'd each
take a team, and we'd come up

24:20.507 --> 24:22.507
with a dance, and then we're
gonna actually perform it at one

24:22.507 --> 24:24.507
of the nightclubs tomorrow night.

24:24.507 --> 24:25.507
What?

24:25.507 --> 24:26.507

24:26.507 --> 24:29.507
Wait, we'd do it at a
club? Like, bring it on.

24:29.507 --> 24:32.007
Best surprise, right?
Why not give a gift where you're

24:32.007 --> 24:35.740
gonna have people, like, push
their limits, learn something?

24:35.740 --> 24:38.974
Dancing with the Starshas such
a special place in my heart.

24:38.974 --> 24:41.840
I feel like I kind of lost
myself for a while, and it was

24:41.840 --> 24:44.474
weird.
Dancing just kind of lit that

24:44.474 --> 24:48.207
fire under my ass, and I found
myself again.

24:48.207 --> 24:51.174
And I just know for a fact,
because how I felt with <i>Dancing</i>

24:51.174 --> 24:53.707
with the Stars, these girls are
really gonna love it once they

24:53.707 --> 24:55.074
perform their dance live.

24:55.074 --> 24:57.074
So, I'm taking the
twins.

24:57.074 --> 24:59.374
- She's... no, no, no.
- She's done this before.

24:59.374 --> 25:00.447

25:00.447 --> 25:02.447
No, Nicole is on my

25:02.447 --> 25:04.280
This is not like
anything Nikki did on <i>Dancing</i>

25:04.280 --> 25:06.280
with the Stars.
I created this with Brinn, and

25:06.280 --> 25:09.914
she's the creator of Pumpfident,
which is sexy, amazing women

25:09.914 --> 25:12.714
dancing in heels.
And so we've created a routine

25:12.714 --> 25:13.714
for you guys to do.

25:13.714 --> 25:15.714
I'm definitely not gonna
dance in heels.

25:15.714 --> 25:17.780
Can we do this in tennis shoes?

25:17.780 --> 25:20.780
Oh, my gosh.
She flew in, like, celebrity pro

25:20.780 --> 25:23.914
dancers. Like, what?
Like, this is getting out of

25:23.914 --> 25:25.380
control with these surprises.

25:25.380 --> 25:28.080
We'll split up, so
you guys don't get to see what

25:28.080 --> 25:30.747
each other are doing until the
night and in the moment.

25:30.747 --> 25:31.747

25:31.747 --> 25:32.747
I'm gonna take a shot.

25:32.747 --> 25:33.747
She's so nervous.

25:33.747 --> 25:34.814
Yeah.

25:34.814 --> 25:36.814
Brandon, I want to take
a shot.

25:36.814 --> 25:38.080
Liquid courage for this dancing

25:39.080 --> 25:41.480
I throw people around.
I don't dance.

25:41.480 --> 25:42.647
You don't dance.

25:42.647 --> 25:44.847
Dumb.
I shake my ass, that's about it.

25:44.847 --> 25:46.147

We're gonna go... go
practice to beat you.

26:21.087 --> 26:22.487
Have fun, Mama.

26:22.487 --> 26:25.220
Bring it on.
Our team is Nattie, Nicole and

26:25.220 --> 26:28.020
I, and we're going against Nia,
Lana and Paige.

26:28.020 --> 26:29.520
I'm gonna have to amp it up now.

26:29.520 --> 26:30.587
Good luck.

26:30.587 --> 26:33.120
Bitch, get your
goddamn heels on 'cause we need

26:33.120 --> 26:34.120
you right now.

26:34.120 --> 26:35.120
Yeah.

26:35.120 --> 26:39.020

Go, please. ♪

26:39.020 --> 26:40.054
Dance time, ladies.

26:40.054 --> 26:41.054
Nervous.

26:41.054 --> 26:45.487
So, it's about 30
seconds of choreography each.

26:45.487 --> 26:47.887
You guys are the first crew to
battle.

26:47.887 --> 26:49.754
So you're gonna start the whole
thing.

26:49.754 --> 26:50.620
We're gonna be great.

26:50.620 --> 26:51.620
Yes?

26:51.620 --> 26:52.620
Yes.

26:52.620 --> 26:54.654
I feel like we've got
the winning team right here.

26:54.654 --> 26:56.520
This is the dream
team.

26:56.520 --> 26:57.387
A dream team.

26:57.387 --> 26:59.994
It's very, like,
sexy, girly movements.

26:59.994 --> 27:01.994
Do you guys have any injuries?
I know you have a neck injury.

27:01.994 --> 27:02.994
Yeah.

27:02.994 --> 27:04.994
I had separated my
shoulder about eight weeks ago,

27:04.994 --> 27:06.927
but it's better.
I just can't do any, like,

27:06.927 --> 27:08.760
handstands or anything like that.

27:08.760 --> 27:10.527
Fantastic. We're not
gonna do those.

27:11.527 --> 27:14.427
We're definitely not gonna do
handstands. To the mirror.

27:14.427 --> 27:15.427
Okay, this is so fun.

27:15.427 --> 27:17.060
I know, right?

27:17.060 --> 27:19.060
They don't have
floor‐work. We do.

27:19.060 --> 27:20.060
Yeah!

27:20.060 --> 27:21.127
Floor‐work!

27:21.127 --> 27:23.194
Wrist goes here, we go
slide.

27:23.194 --> 27:24.194
Ooh.

27:24.194 --> 27:25.194
Slide.

27:25.194 --> 27:28.860
Seven, eight, one.
Drop your booty back over your

27:28.860 --> 27:29.994
heel, yes.

27:29.994 --> 27:35.927
And pop, and pop.
Yes. You guys, this is so good.

27:35.927 --> 27:40.194
Taking a couple shots
did kind of help, but my knees

27:40.194 --> 27:43.127
are in pain.
You know, we wrestle 300 days a

27:43.127 --> 27:45.127
year.
That's gonna be hard for me.

27:46.127 --> 27:48.527
Anything that's hard
for you, I can adjust, babe.

27:48.527 --> 27:49.527
No, I'm gonna get it.

27:49.527 --> 27:50.527
Okay.

27:50.527 --> 27:52.527
The only thing I can't
do is the slide, pump.

27:52.527 --> 27:53.294
Yeah.

27:53.294 --> 27:55.060
We try and do, like,
the slide, pump, I'm like...

27:56.060 --> 27:57.060
I know.

27:57.060 --> 27:59.194
You guys are doing so
good, by tomorrow, we're gonna

27:59.194 --> 28:00.200
be destroying them.

28:00.200 --> 28:02.200
We'll destroy them.
Brie and Nattie, not the best

28:02.200 --> 28:04.200
dancers. Nikki's the killer.

28:04.200 --> 28:06.200
Nikki. Nattie, I'm not
worried about.

28:06.200 --> 28:08.367
No. Nattie, I'm
definitely not worried.

28:08.367 --> 28:11.367
Thank you, Jesus.
Nia picked Paige and I on her

28:11.367 --> 28:13.567
team.
Like, I love Nattie, but let me

28:13.567 --> 28:15.967
tell you.
She has a lot of skills.

28:15.967 --> 28:18.367
Dancing is not one of them.

28:18.367 --> 28:19.934
Yes!

28:19.934 --> 28:22.934
Sorry, I popped my
hip. Like, it's good.

28:22.934 --> 28:23.767
It's all good.

28:23.767 --> 28:26.134
Mine does that all
the time. And then snap.

28:26.134 --> 28:27.967
Gotcha.
I love this.

28:27.967 --> 28:28.967
I'm having so much fun.

28:28.967 --> 28:30.834
Me, too.
I knew it was gonna be perfect.

28:30.834 --> 28:32.834
I just, I love this
kind of stuff.

28:32.834 --> 28:36.200
I love dancing, and I've wanted
to expand my dancing horizons

28:36.200 --> 28:37.200

28:37.200 --> 28:40.667
Run, run, run and
point. Your turn.

28:41.834 --> 28:44.867
Practice is going
great. My team is going to win.

28:44.867 --> 28:47.734

like, taking a sip. I look over.

30:09.180 --> 30:11.180
There's paparazzi
that's literally hiding behind

30:11.180 --> 30:13.280

You almost feel a little

30:13.280 --> 30:17.214
violated, and they're really
wanting to zoom in on Nicole.

I agree. It's so true.

To, obviously, an
extent. I mean, they're ruining

31:01.233 --> 31:02.999

beach, but...

31:02.999 --> 31:04.933

cared that much. I don't know.

I just never, ever thought in my
life that I would be followed by

31:26.999 --> 31:29.099
the paparazzi.
I'm just like, "Go find someone

Bring in mama mode this
weekend has really, you know,

35:51.159 --> 35:54.193
sparked some ideas in my head on
a surprise that I've been

35:54.193 --> 35:56.693
working on.
And I'm really excited tonight

35:56.693 --> 36:00.833
because I can show the girls my
surprise.

36:00.833 --> 36:04.166
We'll get you a Fireball.
Four Fireballs.

36:04.166 --> 36:05.266
We'll get you a couple drinks.

36:05.266 --> 36:07.133
Well, um, Paige told me
I can't drink anymore Fireballs,

36:07.133 --> 36:07.966
so...

36:07.966 --> 36:10.033
No, she can't, not
before the big, big, uh...

36:10.033 --> 36:11.933
I'm supposed to say the big, the
big game.

36:11.933 --> 36:13.833
I guarantee you this
girl can dance.

36:13.833 --> 36:15.566
No. No.
Don't listen to her.

36:15.566 --> 36:16.466
Who's gonna kill it?

36:16.466 --> 36:17.399
She could kill it

36:17.399 --> 36:18.333
faced.

36:18.333 --> 36:20.799
She's trying to get
you to drink.

36:20.799 --> 36:23.066
I'm gonna drink right
there with you, Lana.

36:23.066 --> 36:24.833
I'm not letting anyone‐‐
I'm going to dance...

36:24.833 --> 36:26.633
You're my enemy
tonight.

36:26.633 --> 36:27.499
Yeah.

36:27.499 --> 36:29.499
I see right through
what Brie's trying to do.

36:29.499 --> 36:32.999
She knows I love Fireball shots.
She knows that I like to have a

36:32.999 --> 36:35.066
little "lituation."

36:35.066 --> 36:37.033
This isn't the season
finale of <i>Dancing with the</i>

Stars. No one's going anywhere.
It's fine.

36:40.999 --> 36:44.066
But I am not going to
fall for this temptation.

36:44.066 --> 36:47.099
Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope.
I see what Brie's doing.

36:47.099 --> 36:50.066
She's‐‐ Brie doesn't even take
Fireball shots and she's trying

36:50.066 --> 36:51.533
to drink Fireball shots with me?

36:51.533 --> 36:53.366
We're out there for 30
seconds.

36:53.366 --> 36:55.533
You don't want to have fun at
dinner for 30 seconds of life?

36:55.533 --> 36:57.133
That's true.

36:57.133 --> 36:58.066
I wasn't going...

36:58.066 --> 37:00.033
Don't listen to 'em.
They're good. They're good.

37:00.033 --> 37:01.739
Hey, we're drinking, so
you can sit there sober, no big

37:01.739 --> 37:02.739
deal.

37:02.739 --> 37:04.506
I feel very, very
good.

37:04.506 --> 37:06.406
Oh, you feel very
confident?

37:06.406 --> 37:08.039
We just have to all,
every single one of us, slow

37:08.039 --> 37:09.039
down tonight a little bit.

37:09.039 --> 37:10.872
So it's almost time for
my surprise.

37:10.872 --> 37:12.706
I just want to make sure
everything is perfect.

37:12.706 --> 37:14.606
I just want to ask you
something.

37:14.606 --> 37:15.839
Your boobies look really great.

37:15.839 --> 37:16.806
Oh, thanks.

37:16.806 --> 37:20.073
So I'm gonna talk to
the restaurant manager and just

37:20.073 --> 37:23.539
make sure everything is in place.
You two will have some sake.

37:23.539 --> 37:25.539
Oh, hi there.
How are you?

37:25.539 --> 37:26.473
Ooh, look at that sake.

37:26.473 --> 37:27.339
Yeah.

37:27.339 --> 37:29.239
Feel how soft my tits
are.

37:29.239 --> 37:31.206
Yeah, they're really
soft.

37:31.206 --> 37:32.373
Right?

37:32.373 --> 37:33.828
Oh, my God!

37:45.906 --> 37:48.373
Mom! Oh, my God!

37:48.373 --> 37:50.773
Oh, my God, Nattie,
turn around.

37:50.773 --> 37:51.773
Yeah.

37:51.773 --> 37:53.573
Oh, my God.

37:53.573 --> 37:56.106
Aw, it makes me want
to cry.

37:56.106 --> 37:59.106
I've been here since
last night. It was torture.

37:59.106 --> 38:00.679
What the hell, Mom?

38:00.679 --> 38:02.513
Oh, I love you so
much.

38:02.513 --> 38:04.246
It was your birthday,
and...

38:04.246 --> 38:05.879
This is the nicest
thing ever.

38:05.879 --> 38:07.646
...Brie wanted to do
something extra nice for you

38:07.646 --> 38:08.546
guys and this was the surprise.

38:08.546 --> 38:10.346
Doesn't she look so
pretty?

38:10.346 --> 38:12.079
You look so
pretty.

38:12.079 --> 38:12.946
You're so pretty.

38:12.946 --> 38:14.879
I'm so beyond blessed in
my life.

38:14.879 --> 38:16.679
I get to have this job, it's a
dream job, and I get to live out

38:16.679 --> 38:20.279
my dream every day.
And none of this would be

38:20.279 --> 38:23.979
possible without my mom.
I'm just so grateful to her.

38:23.979 --> 38:26.946
Thank you so much.
It was so unexpected. Oh, my God.

38:26.946 --> 38:28.679
I knew you wanted to
see your mom so bad.

38:28.679 --> 38:29.513
Yeah.

38:29.513 --> 38:30.813
Amazing, you did it.

38:30.813 --> 38:34.246
Now that I'm a mom, I
see these two daughters reacting

38:34.246 --> 38:37.846
to their moms like this, it just
makes me see how special a

38:37.846 --> 38:40.746
mother‐daughter relationship is,
and how it will always be this

38:40.746 --> 38:43.713
special. I just love that.

38:43.713 --> 38:46.513
She's been talking
about how much she's missed you.

38:46.513 --> 38:47.513
Yeah.

38:47.513 --> 38:48.579
Aw.

38:48.579 --> 38:50.513
I'm gonna start
crying.

38:50.513 --> 38:52.579
She wasn't there at
WrestleMania 'cause I didn't

38:52.579 --> 38:57.446
think that I was gonna win.
And it was a big moment.

38:57.446 --> 38:58.679
And it isn't really fair...

38:58.679 --> 39:00.486
No, it was way more
important that your brothers

39:00.486 --> 39:01.253
were there.

39:01.253 --> 39:03.186
...that she wasn't
there.

39:03.186 --> 39:05.086
No, I‐I wanted my
fam to‐‐ I wanted the three

39:05.086 --> 39:06.886
children to be there, that was,
to me, more important.

39:06.886 --> 39:09.653
You know that.

39:09.653 --> 39:11.753
I know.

39:11.753 --> 39:14.653
I just want to say,
first of all, thank you guys so

39:14.653 --> 39:16.953
much for giving me one of the
best birthdays of my life.

39:16.953 --> 39:19.619
I think Nia can agree that I
don't... I don't know what's

39:19.619 --> 39:20.919
gonna top this.

39:20.919 --> 39:23.153
Yeah, you guys are
party animals.

39:23.153 --> 39:24.519
Yeah, we are.

39:24.519 --> 39:25.786
Oh, yeah.

Hole.

39:27.119 --> 39:28.786

Yo, baby, let's party!

39:42.186 --> 39:44.753

tequila?

39:47.219 --> 39:49.986
Nattie's mommy's here.
My mom's here.

39:49.986 --> 39:53.019
No Fireball for Mom.
Stop trying to sabotage our

39:53.019 --> 39:54.453
dance, Mom.

39:54.453 --> 39:58.253

- Okay, one drink.

39:58.253 --> 40:00.593

This was the whole purpose of

Honestly, this has been
the most epic birthday I've ever

42:36.806 --> 42:41.206
had. I had my girl crew, we had a
bunch of fun, and then my mom

42:41.206 --> 42:44.039
gets to come, and she adds to
the girl crew.

42:44.039 --> 42:46.973

To be fair, I was not excited
