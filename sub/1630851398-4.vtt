<i>How, what, where, why?</i>
<i>What, where, why?</i>

00:17.726 --> 00:20.353
<i>How, what, where, why?</i>
<i>What, where, why?</i>

00:20.437 --> 00:22.897
<i>Ada Twist, scientist</i>

00:22.981 --> 00:25.859
<i>She’s gonna find out what the answer is</i>

00:25.942 --> 00:28.528
<i>Under here, over there</i>

00:28.611 --> 00:30.989
<i>Science is everywhere you look</i>

00:31.072 --> 00:33.992
<i>With Iggy Peck, architect</i>

00:34.075 --> 00:36.536
<i>And Rosie Revere, engineer</i>

00:36.619 --> 00:39.122
<i>So much to do and you can help too!</i>

00:39.205 --> 00:42.042
<i>A mystery, a riddle, a puzzle or a quest</i>

00:42.125 --> 00:45.128
<i>There are wonders to discover</i>
<i>And hypotheses to test</i>

00:45.211 --> 00:46.504
<i>Science is the best!</i>

00:46.588 --> 00:49.132
<i>Ada Twist, scientist</i>

00:49.215 --> 00:51.926
<i>She’s gonna find out what the answer is</i>

00:52.010 --> 00:56.222
<i>Everywhere science is</i>
<i>She’s forming a hypothesis</i>

00:56.306 --> 00:59.642
<i>Connecting all the dots</i>
<i>’Cause this is Scientist Ada Twist!</i>

01:07.358 --> 01:10.153
Great idea,
making these bird-head costumes, Rosie.

01:10.236 --> 01:11.780
Perfect for birdwatching.

01:11.863 --> 01:16.076
They are, right? Are you sure
we don’t need the whole bird costume?

01:16.159 --> 01:18.787
The heads are all we need
so the birds don’t see us.

01:18.870 --> 01:21.706
-We don’t want to scare them.
-They scare me.

01:21.790 --> 01:24.000
I don’t want them watching me watch them.

01:24.084 --> 01:26.795
But I’ll do it for science.
And my besties.

01:26.878 --> 01:31.925
Come on. Less talking, more squawking.
I mean birdwatching.

01:32.634 --> 01:33.760
No feathers.

01:33.843 --> 01:37.138
-Freaky.
-Great observation, Iggy.

01:37.222 --> 01:39.849
-This bird is a hatchling, so--
-Hatch who?

01:39.933 --> 01:41.226
Bless you.

01:41.309 --> 01:45.021
No, baby birds are called hatchlings.
They don’t have feathers.

01:47.315 --> 01:49.025
It’s the mama bird.

01:50.693 --> 01:52.278
Feeding her baby.

02:02.038 --> 02:04.249
The hatchling
has a teeny bit of feathers now.

02:04.332 --> 02:06.501
That means it’s turning into a fledgling.

02:06.584 --> 02:08.753
That’s a little less freaky.

02:09.420 --> 02:11.131
The mama bird’s leaving.

02:11.214 --> 02:13.967
Probably to find food,

02:14.050 --> 02:17.428
which she does every day at exactly… now.

02:29.107 --> 02:30.108
-The nest!
-Oh no!

02:30.191 --> 02:32.026
We have to get over there, now!

02:33.862 --> 02:35.655
No!

02:38.908 --> 02:41.286
Mooshu!

02:41.911 --> 02:42.787
Gotcha!

02:43.496 --> 02:45.707
I got it.

02:47.876 --> 02:48.918
I don’t got it.

02:49.002 --> 02:53.673
Mooshu, I know cats
are supposed to chase birds, but behave.

02:59.220 --> 03:03.308
Look at him.
He’s so little. He needs his mama.

03:03.391 --> 03:06.644
According to my notes,
she just left for food,

03:06.728 --> 03:09.564
and from what we observed
the past few days,

03:09.647 --> 03:12.942
she won’t be back for at least four hours.

03:13.026 --> 03:16.821
We have to do something.
We need a brainstorm.

03:16.905 --> 03:21.242
I know. We could make a teeny hammock
and tie it in the tree.

03:21.326 --> 03:23.077
What about wind? He could fall out.

03:24.037 --> 03:26.956
True. That would be pretty scary.

03:27.040 --> 03:30.585
I could build it a birdhouse
with lots of rooms and balconies.

03:30.668 --> 03:33.504
A landing pad. A chocolate fountain!

03:33.588 --> 03:37.175
That sounds amazing,
but is that too much house for a bird?

03:37.258 --> 03:38.092
You’re right.

03:38.176 --> 03:42.305
We could keep him in my hair.
My mum says it’s like a nest up there.

03:42.388 --> 03:44.766
But what if more birds
think your hair is a nest?

03:44.849 --> 03:47.977
Yeah, that would be pretty bad.

03:48.061 --> 03:49.187
That’s it!

03:50.104 --> 03:51.314
No, it isn’t.

03:51.397 --> 03:56.319
I don’t want a flock of birds in my hair.
It takes forever to get the feathers out.

03:56.402 --> 04:00.698
No, we could build the bird a new nest.
Not in Rosie’s hair though.

04:00.782 --> 04:02.200
Great idea!

04:02.283 --> 04:04.202
We’ll put him here while we work.

04:04.285 --> 04:08.081
Here you go, little birdie.
We’re gonna make you a new nest.

04:08.164 --> 04:10.250
So how do we make a nest?

04:10.333 --> 04:14.087
First, let’s see what his nest is made of.
Loading the lab.

04:21.970 --> 04:23.221
I’ll get the microscope.

04:23.304 --> 04:27.433
I love seeing what things are made of.
Engineering 101.

04:28.726 --> 04:31.187
Incredible!

04:31.271 --> 04:32.647
Look at the twigs.

04:32.730 --> 04:35.900
How they weave in and out of each other.
And the fluff-work?

04:38.736 --> 04:41.197
This is magical engineering.

04:41.281 --> 04:43.825
Birds are really good architects.

04:43.908 --> 04:44.909
And engineers.

04:44.993 --> 04:46.077
Who knew?

04:46.160 --> 04:49.330
Okay, so it looks like the nest we make

04:49.414 --> 04:52.417
should have twigs, leaves and fluff.

04:52.500 --> 04:54.752
And sparkly stuff for decoration.

04:55.295 --> 04:56.963
I have an idea for a design.

05:11.144 --> 05:13.229
And… done.

05:13.813 --> 05:16.607
-So cool!
-Let’s get supplies.

05:22.280 --> 05:23.489
I’ve got leaves.

05:23.573 --> 05:28.786
I have so many twigs. Maybe you should
call me “Twiggy” instead of “Iggy.”

05:29.537 --> 05:33.249
And Rosie brings up the rear
with dandelion fluff.

05:33.333 --> 05:37.628
And sparkles. Come on, let’s build a nest.

05:37.712 --> 05:40.340
Just one more twig.

05:40.423 --> 05:42.425
And… done.

05:43.634 --> 05:45.720
-Love the design, Iggy.
-Thanks.

05:45.803 --> 05:48.848
I was inspired by the twig-weaving
in the original nest.

05:48.931 --> 05:50.308
Let’s put the bird in it.

05:50.850 --> 05:51.851
Wait!

05:52.685 --> 05:56.522
We should test the nest first.
Make sure it’s safe for the birdie.

05:58.775 --> 06:02.862
Are we scientists or not?
Of course we should test it.

06:02.945 --> 06:04.238
But… how?

06:05.656 --> 06:10.286
We could make a test bird.
Small and soft, just like the baby bird.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.622
Rosie Rule number 32.

06:12.705 --> 06:15.917
I know. “Always have balloons.”
But what does that have to do with--

06:16.000 --> 06:18.836
Will this wise old owl do the trick?

06:18.920 --> 06:20.546
-Good one.
-It’s perfect.

06:24.759 --> 06:26.094
He got scared.

06:26.177 --> 06:29.305
If by “he” you mean me, you’re right.

06:30.306 --> 06:33.309
Look at this face. He’s not so scary.

06:33.393 --> 06:38.606
I guess he’s not that scary
when he’s not jumping on me.

06:38.689 --> 06:41.734
I think the nest
was too twiggy for the birdie.

06:41.818 --> 06:43.653
Yeah, I think you’re right.

06:43.736 --> 06:46.697
He’s soft. Want to touch him, Iggy?

06:47.615 --> 06:49.325
No, that’s okay.

06:53.037 --> 06:54.664
I think he likes you.

06:56.624 --> 06:58.876
He is kind of cute,

06:58.960 --> 07:01.796
and his feathers are really soft.

07:02.338 --> 07:04.757
Soft! I have an idea.

07:06.634 --> 07:12.807
Less twigs, more leaves and fluff.
This one is definitely not too twiggy.

07:12.890 --> 07:15.226
It’s super soft.

07:15.810 --> 07:17.186
Oh no!

07:22.692 --> 07:25.736
I wanted to design
a cool, creative nest for you.

07:25.820 --> 07:28.906
But I guess
I’m not as good an architect as birds are.

07:29.407 --> 07:30.408
<i>I give up</i>

07:31.742 --> 07:33.744
<i>I can’t do it</i>
<i>Going to quit</i>

07:34.787 --> 07:36.247
<i>Can’t get through it</i>
<i>Hit a wall</i>

07:36.330 --> 07:38.916
<i>It’s so impossible</i>
<i>When all I see are obstacles</i>

07:39.000 --> 07:41.502
<i>Afraid I’m going to fail and so I quit</i>

07:42.003 --> 07:44.422
<i>There’s no use in trying</i>

07:44.505 --> 07:49.218
<i>There’s no way that we can win</i>

07:49.302 --> 07:50.595
<i>Don’t give up</i>

07:50.678 --> 07:52.180
<i>Don’t give in</i>

07:52.263 --> 07:55.766
<i>Gotta get right back up and try again</i>

07:55.850 --> 07:58.102
<i>Mistakes can be lucky breaks</i>

07:58.186 --> 08:01.272
<i>A happy accident along the way</i>

08:01.355 --> 08:02.982
<i>Don’t give up</i>

08:03.065 --> 08:04.775
<i>Don’t give in</i>

08:04.859 --> 08:08.029
<i>Maybe you’ll make failure your best friend</i>

08:08.112 --> 08:10.740
<i>And try, try, try</i>

08:10.823 --> 08:15.369
<i>Got to get up and try again</i>

08:18.456 --> 08:21.292
Okay, I’ll try again.

08:21.375 --> 08:24.086
But where do I even start?

08:24.170 --> 08:26.756
Well, according to my notes,

08:26.839 --> 08:32.053
the original nest
was twiggy, soft and sparkly, right?

08:32.136 --> 08:36.140
Yup. My first nest was too twiggy,
and my second nest was too soft.

08:36.224 --> 08:37.808
And not sparkly enough.

08:37.892 --> 08:41.145
So we just need to get
the perfect combination of both.

08:41.229 --> 08:42.855
And sparkles.

08:46.734 --> 08:47.818
What are you doing?

08:47.902 --> 08:50.613
Trying to ask the birdie
what kind of nest he wants.

08:50.696 --> 08:55.368
I don’t think he can answer you.
He’s still a baby. He can’t speak yet.

08:55.451 --> 08:57.203
Totally excellent point.

08:57.286 --> 09:00.289
But, Rosie, you just gave me an idea.

09:01.165 --> 09:04.377
If we’re the birds,
we can talk to ourselves.

09:04.460 --> 09:06.128
-Okay.
-Huh?

09:06.212 --> 09:09.298
Then we can feel
if it’s too pointy or too soft.

09:09.382 --> 09:11.551
We can get the right combo
of twiggy and soft.

09:11.634 --> 09:12.927
And add sparkles.

09:13.010 --> 09:17.348
Exactly. Turns out making full
bird costumes was a great idea, Rosie.

09:18.349 --> 09:20.309
That means “thanks” in bird.

09:20.393 --> 09:22.061
So let’s test this nest.

09:38.160 --> 09:40.997
Strong, but not too pointy.

09:41.080 --> 09:44.625
Soft, but not too soft.

09:44.709 --> 09:48.337
It’s perfect! Thanks
for not letting me give up, you guys.

09:48.421 --> 09:50.631
Hey, that’s what besties are for.

09:51.507 --> 09:54.218
Teamwork makes the dream work.

09:54.302 --> 09:56.971
I wanted to design
a cool, creative nest so bad

09:57.054 --> 09:59.181
that I didn’t think
about what the bird needed.

09:59.265 --> 10:01.183
Great realisation, Iggy.

10:01.267 --> 10:05.062
Let’s see if the birdie
feels as comfortable in his nest as we do.

10:05.146 --> 10:07.398
Some of us a little too comfortable.

10:07.481 --> 10:09.108
Come on, Rosie.

10:09.191 --> 10:10.651
Five more minutes.

10:12.153 --> 10:14.572
That means “feed me” in bird.

10:22.204 --> 10:24.707
He loves it. You did it, Iggy.

10:24.790 --> 10:28.336
We did it. By looking at it
from the bird’s point of view.

10:28.878 --> 10:29.754
New theory.

10:29.837 --> 10:31.464
The Bird’s Eye View theory,

10:31.547 --> 10:35.092
when you solve a problem by looking at it
from another point of view.

10:35.176 --> 10:36.469
Oh boy, that’s great!

10:36.552 --> 10:39.180
I like it. A lot.

10:39.263 --> 10:42.099
I’ll get my dad
to help us put the nest in the tree.

10:44.393 --> 10:46.771
I hope Kiwi’s mum likes the nest.

10:46.854 --> 10:47.938
-Kiwi?
-Who’s that?

10:48.022 --> 10:53.611
The bird. He’s brownish with adorable
green and black spots in his feathers.

10:53.694 --> 10:55.446
-Love it!
-Perfect!

11:00.326 --> 11:03.996
-I think the mama bird likes it.
-She loves it.

11:04.080 --> 11:06.165
And Kiwi looks happy and safe.

11:06.248 --> 11:09.835
So do you love birds now, Iggy?

11:10.961 --> 11:14.674
I don’t know about birds, but I love Kiwi.

11:19.970 --> 11:24.350
I have an idea.
Let’s meet another scientist. Come on.

11:28.020 --> 11:30.773
Hi, I’m Whitney, and I’m an ornithologist.

11:30.856 --> 11:33.651
Today, we’re gonna be
talking about bird nests.

11:33.734 --> 11:37.113
We don’t need this birdhouse.
The real thing's over there. Come on.

11:37.780 --> 11:38.656
Let's go!

11:38.739 --> 11:40.866
Birds make a lot
of different types of nests

11:40.950 --> 11:43.703
because they all live
in different habitats.

11:43.786 --> 11:45.871
They’ll all be a little bit different.

11:45.955 --> 11:49.500
Kind of like how you decorate your room
different from your friend.

11:49.583 --> 11:51.752
Here we have nests
of two different species,

11:51.836 --> 11:54.296
and you can see
that the shape is very similar.

11:54.380 --> 11:56.966
They both form a cup-shaped nest,

11:57.049 --> 11:59.427
but this one has just twigs,

11:59.510 --> 12:04.306
and this one is twigs on the inside
and covered with moss on the outside.

12:04.390 --> 12:07.727
They make their nests
out of different materials

12:07.810 --> 12:11.397
because each bird has
different materials available to them.

12:11.480 --> 12:14.900
They might use
string that they find on the ground

12:14.984 --> 12:18.654
or any trash that they find
that might be soft for their nest.

12:18.738 --> 12:21.615
So if you look at nests
from birds in the city

12:21.699 --> 12:24.827
and compare them to birds
that might nest in the forest,

12:24.910 --> 12:27.037
those nests might look very different.

12:28.080 --> 12:32.501
Some materials that birds use
to make nests are warmer than others.

12:32.585 --> 12:36.630
So if you look at this nest,
it looks like it has a lot of spiderwebs

12:36.714 --> 12:39.550
and maybe some insulating fur,

12:39.633 --> 12:41.594
and it looks like it would be pretty warm

12:41.677 --> 12:45.181
compared to a nest that looks
more like this, where it’s just twigs.

12:45.264 --> 12:48.476
It’s a bit more airy
and that nest might be a little cooler.

12:48.976 --> 12:51.729
Some birds rebuild their nests every year.

12:51.812 --> 12:55.274
Other birds will come back
to the same nest and reuse their nest.

12:55.357 --> 12:58.486
So if you see a nest,
maybe the birds are on vacation,

12:58.569 --> 13:02.865
and they might come back to the nest,
so leave it where it is just in case.

13:03.741 --> 13:05.367
Fun fact!

13:06.827 --> 13:09.205
The smallest bird nest
is made by a hummingbird,

13:09.288 --> 13:10.831
and it’s about this big.

13:10.915 --> 13:13.667
And the largest bird nest
is made by an eagle,

13:13.751 --> 13:18.380
and it’s nine and a half feet wide,
which is longer than my arms outstretched.

13:18.464 --> 13:20.424
I could even fit in that nest.

13:20.508 --> 13:23.969
Wasn’t that cool? Science is the best!

13:29.475 --> 13:30.476
Good morning.

13:30.559 --> 13:34.605
Is it me, or does your brain feel fresher
after a good night’s sleep?

13:35.314 --> 13:37.650
Don’t you just love mornings?

13:42.071 --> 13:44.281
Do brains work better in the morning?

13:44.365 --> 13:47.701
I come up with some of my best questions
in the morning.

13:47.785 --> 13:49.703
So, yeah, I guess they do.

14:04.635 --> 14:06.595
That’s strange.

14:09.682 --> 14:12.309
Correction. Very strange.

14:15.479 --> 14:16.480
-Hey.
-Morning, Ada.

14:16.564 --> 14:19.692
Oh, Rosie, Iggy.
You’re early for the sleepover.

14:19.775 --> 14:22.486
If you call six hours early early.

14:22.570 --> 14:24.780
Rosie wanted to get here
in time for breakfast.

14:30.995 --> 14:33.914
-What’s wrong with them?
-Haven’t figured that out yet.

14:33.998 --> 14:36.667
This might need a hypot…

14:36.750 --> 14:38.168
A hypoz…

14:38.752 --> 14:40.170
Hiposys…

14:40.254 --> 14:43.424
That thing scientists do
when they try to guess what’s going on.

14:43.507 --> 14:44.717
A hypothesis.

14:44.800 --> 14:45.968
Yes.

14:46.051 --> 14:49.471
When scientists imagine an explanation,
and then try to prove it.

14:49.555 --> 14:50.806
Good thinking, Rosie.

14:51.682 --> 14:52.892
Let’s see.

14:56.061 --> 14:59.982
Everyone’s walking around in their PJs
and yawning.

15:00.065 --> 15:02.067
And their eyes are barely open.

15:03.319 --> 15:08.991
Yawning, PJs, eyes barely open.
Well, the answer is obvious.

15:10.451 --> 15:12.453
They’ve been turned into zombies!

15:13.704 --> 15:18.667
A tiny wizard probably snuck in,
sprinkled your family with zombie dust,

15:18.751 --> 15:21.670
then flew off on his getaway unicorn.

15:22.421 --> 15:25.049
Wait.

15:25.132 --> 15:27.760
This kitchen has no place
to park a unicorn.

15:27.843 --> 15:29.261
True.

15:29.345 --> 15:31.388
And now that I think about it,

15:31.472 --> 15:35.726
I’ve noticed some stuff
that might prove something else.

15:37.102 --> 15:41.357
Arthur’s been staying up late
a lot lately, which means…

15:41.440 --> 15:44.735
He’s probably really tired
in the morning and can’t get up.

15:44.818 --> 15:48.405
It also means he probably
hasn’t been getting up in time

15:48.489 --> 15:50.491
to do his newspaper deliveries.

15:51.283 --> 15:54.161
That’s why I saw your mum and dad
delivering newspapers.

15:54.244 --> 15:55.621
They were doing it for Arthur.

15:57.539 --> 15:58.999
Oh no.

15:59.792 --> 16:02.044
Now that we know this,

16:02.127 --> 16:04.505
I think we should revise our hizzop…

16:05.464 --> 16:07.716
Our hizza…

16:07.800 --> 16:10.427
Boy, that is hard to say!

16:10.511 --> 16:11.971
Hippopotamus?

16:12.054 --> 16:13.389
Hypothesis.

16:13.472 --> 16:16.767
You’re right.
We need a new one, and I’ve got it.

16:17.476 --> 16:19.144
My family aren’t zombies.

16:19.895 --> 16:21.438
They’re just sleepy.

16:22.773 --> 16:24.775
We need to solve this problem.

16:25.776 --> 16:28.779
Okay, so Arthur sleeping in

16:28.862 --> 16:31.907
is why my parents
have had to deliver the papers for him.

16:31.991 --> 16:35.035
So we need to find a way
to make sure Arthur gets sleep.

16:35.119 --> 16:36.370
Makes sense.

16:36.453 --> 16:39.081
If he gets sleep,
then your parents will too,

16:39.164 --> 16:41.875
and no one will be sleep zombies.

16:41.959 --> 16:43.293
We need a brainstorm.

16:43.377 --> 16:45.087
Oh, this is my favourite part.

16:45.170 --> 16:47.965
<i>Brainstorm, brainstorm</i>

16:48.048 --> 16:50.801
<i>Throw in every thought you had</i>
<i>No idea is ever bad</i>

16:50.884 --> 16:53.554
<i>Brainstorm, brainstorm</i>

16:53.637 --> 16:56.432
<i>Gather up your friends</i>
<i>Try to find the how, the what, the why</i>

16:56.515 --> 16:59.268
<i>Brainstorm, brainstorm</i>

16:59.351 --> 17:03.981
<i>Let our imaginations</i>
<i>Become great new creations</i>

17:04.064 --> 17:07.776
<i>When we brainstorm, brainstorm</i>
<i>Brainstorm, brainstorm</i>

17:07.860 --> 17:08.902
<i>Hey!</i>

17:09.611 --> 17:13.824
What if Arthur could deliver his papers
from bed using tubes?

17:13.907 --> 17:15.701
Then it wouldn’t matter if he slept in.

17:15.784 --> 17:18.996
All you do is reach over
to the nightstand, press a button,

17:19.079 --> 17:20.456
and whoosh!

17:21.040 --> 17:23.042
Papers rocket everywhere.

17:23.125 --> 17:26.086
Powerful. But is it too powerful?

17:33.052 --> 17:34.428
Earthlings!

17:35.763 --> 17:39.725
What if we build Arthur a super alarm
so he doesn’t sleep in?

17:39.808 --> 17:43.687
And it could do all sorts of things
to wake him up.

17:45.314 --> 17:49.109
Including making delicious-smelling bacon.

17:49.193 --> 17:50.778
Now we’re cooking.

17:52.321 --> 17:55.324
Like bacon. I see what you did there.

17:56.450 --> 17:58.660
But why stop with just waking up?

17:59.161 --> 18:01.538
This gizmo could also make sure
he falls asleep.

18:01.622 --> 18:04.500
It could help him count sheep
and fluff his pillow.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.753
And play soothing jazz music
on your mum’s turntable.

18:12.091 --> 18:15.677
Guys, this solution is sleep-tacular!

18:15.761 --> 18:17.554
Let’s figure out how to do it.

18:18.138 --> 18:19.681
Loading the lab.

18:28.941 --> 18:30.901
So let’s get building.

18:30.984 --> 18:34.613
Wait. Rosie, you can’t build our gizmo
until I design it.

18:34.696 --> 18:36.615
I wanna start building now.

18:37.866 --> 18:39.243
But I guess I’ll wait.

18:48.710 --> 18:49.711
Okay.

18:50.712 --> 18:53.090
-That looks amazing.
-Nice.

18:56.135 --> 18:59.638
How’s it going in there? You know
this sleepover's only for one weekend?

18:59.721 --> 19:02.808
And Arthur’s going to be back
from tennis practice soon.

19:03.475 --> 19:04.810
It’s done.

19:08.272 --> 19:09.106
It’s…

19:09.189 --> 19:13.777
Amazing? Spectacular? Beyond belief?

19:13.861 --> 19:15.028
Totally agree.

19:15.112 --> 19:18.365
Since grilling bacon
in your brother’s room

19:18.448 --> 19:22.286
is apparently “not a good idea”

19:22.369 --> 19:24.997
and a “fire hazard,”

19:25.080 --> 19:28.625
according to your parents,
I had to substitute it for cereal.

19:35.215 --> 19:38.260
Since Mum wouldn’t let us
move the turntable from the living room,

19:38.343 --> 19:40.220
we’ve got to come up with something else.

19:40.304 --> 19:44.600
I’ll imitate the calming calls
of the humpback whale.

19:45.225 --> 19:47.477
-That’s how my dad falls asleep.
-What in the…

19:48.061 --> 19:49.438
What is this?

19:49.521 --> 19:51.940
This? Oh, this.

19:52.024 --> 19:55.736
This is how you fall asleep
and wake up from now on.

19:55.819 --> 19:59.531
We call it the Super Sleeper
And Also Waker-Upper gizmo.

19:59.615 --> 20:01.408
Got a nice ring to it, don’t you think?

20:02.826 --> 20:03.660
Kids.

20:03.744 --> 20:06.872
I just want
to get this magic trick to work.

20:06.955 --> 20:11.710
Time to activate the Super Sleeper.
Iggy, cue your whale imitation.

20:27.142 --> 20:28.810
I must be missing something.

20:31.521 --> 20:35.442
Hibby kitties in the ice-cream cards.

20:37.611 --> 20:39.446
What?! Oh no!

20:39.529 --> 20:41.448
Iggy, Rosie! Wake up!

20:41.531 --> 20:45.035
Arthur! Your paper round. Get up!

20:46.119 --> 20:47.579
What time is it?

20:47.663 --> 20:49.081
It’s morning.

20:49.164 --> 20:52.459
Did the Super Sleeper And Waker-Upper
gizmo work?

20:52.542 --> 20:58.382
The Super Sleeper part worked.
Too well. It made us fall asleep.

20:59.258 --> 21:03.637
-How’d these sleeping bags get here?
-My parents must have brought them in.

21:05.138 --> 21:06.556
I guess that’s it.

21:06.640 --> 21:09.559
Your family will be sleep zombies forever.

21:09.643 --> 21:12.271
Hold on. Our sleepover isn’t over.

21:12.354 --> 21:16.400
Scientists don’t give up.
A new idea could come from anywhere.

21:21.905 --> 21:23.949
Dad? Are you all right?

21:24.658 --> 21:25.784
Funny cat video.

21:25.867 --> 21:28.495
Boy, your dad really loves cat videos.

21:29.705 --> 21:33.375
These things really help you stay awake.
Check this one out.

21:34.001 --> 21:37.796
Cat doesn’t see the dancing chicken.

21:40.799 --> 21:44.303
That’s it!
We’re just like that cat in this video.

21:44.386 --> 21:46.888
Why? Is there a giant chicken
dancing around us?

21:46.972 --> 21:49.016
’Cause that would be really terrifying.

21:50.225 --> 21:51.268
In a way, there is.

21:51.351 --> 21:54.146
We’ve been concentrating so hard,

21:54.229 --> 21:57.107
we’ve been missing something
right in front of us.

21:57.190 --> 21:58.150
I’ll show you.

21:58.734 --> 22:03.488
What’s Arthur been doing while we’ve been
trying to solve his sleep problem?

22:03.572 --> 22:06.450
Trying to get his magic trick to work.

22:07.117 --> 22:11.955
But we didn’t notice because we were
too busy trying to get him to sleep.

22:15.167 --> 22:16.293
Cards.

22:19.087 --> 22:23.675
Just like the cat and the dancing chicken.
Now I get it.

22:23.759 --> 22:25.802
Arthur’s been staying up so late

22:25.886 --> 22:28.513
because he’s trying
to get his trick right.

22:28.597 --> 22:33.143
I think we have a new scientific theory.
The Dancing Chicken theory.

22:33.226 --> 22:34.936
When you’re so focused on one thing,

22:35.020 --> 22:37.356
you don’t see
what’s right in front of you.

22:37.439 --> 22:39.941
I like it. I like it a lot.

22:40.025 --> 22:43.862
Ada Twist, scientist, that’s brilliant.

22:43.945 --> 22:48.700
So maybe we help Arthur get his sleep
by helping him with his magic?

22:48.784 --> 22:52.454
Oh no, not you guys again.
What do you want now?

22:52.537 --> 22:55.457
Are you missing a trick card
by any chance?

22:57.626 --> 23:01.004
That’s why the trick
wasn’t working. Thanks!

23:03.799 --> 23:07.135
Breakfast.
What sleepovers are really all about.

23:07.219 --> 23:09.137
-Thanks, Mum and Dad.
-Thank you.

23:09.221 --> 23:11.348
-Papers have been delivered.
-Great.

23:11.431 --> 23:14.434
That’s what I’m talking about, little man.
Great job.

23:14.518 --> 23:15.936
Check out my magic trick.

23:16.019 --> 23:19.564
Thanks to Ada, Rosie and Iggy,
I finally got it to work.

23:24.111 --> 23:24.945
So cool!

23:25.028 --> 23:26.113
-Amazing!
-I love it.

23:26.196 --> 23:28.240
I was missing the special card.

23:28.323 --> 23:30.617
It was right in front of you
the whole time.

23:30.700 --> 23:32.786
Just like the dancing chicken.

23:44.339 --> 23:48.427
I have an idea.
Let’s meet another scientist. Come on.

23:54.599 --> 23:58.395
Hello! My name is Elizabeth Messick
and I’m a magician,

23:58.478 --> 24:00.605
and welcome to my magical space.

24:00.689 --> 24:03.775
Today, we are gonna learn
about the science of magic.

24:03.859 --> 24:05.026
So let’s get to it.

24:10.198 --> 24:12.826
Magic and science go hand in hand.

24:12.909 --> 24:16.496
Science explains how magic works.

24:16.580 --> 24:18.582
Key, key,

24:19.791 --> 24:21.543
move with ease.

24:21.626 --> 24:22.752
Look, it’s moving!

24:25.046 --> 24:27.799
Now let’s try this cup.

24:27.883 --> 24:29.259
Cup, cup,

24:29.843 --> 24:31.720
move with luck.

24:33.680 --> 24:35.849
Let me show you how it’s done.

24:35.932 --> 24:37.726
We used a wand,

24:38.435 --> 24:39.644
a metal object,

24:39.728 --> 24:43.315
and the secret is we used an assistant.
Say hi!

24:43.398 --> 24:44.399
Hello!

24:44.483 --> 24:45.901
And a magnet.

24:46.776 --> 24:48.862
A magnet is a rock or metal

24:48.945 --> 24:51.573
that is attracted
to other certain types of metals,

24:51.656 --> 24:54.409
and the force of magnets
is called magnetism.

24:54.493 --> 24:56.661
Magnetism works over a distance,

24:56.745 --> 24:59.956
so it doesn’t have to be touching
the piece of metal or magnet.

25:05.670 --> 25:09.799
So my assistant actually has his hand
under the table with the magnet,

25:09.883 --> 25:14.513
and he’s moving the magnet around,
making the cup move around.

25:14.596 --> 25:18.600
Sometimes, a magic trick
can take me a couple of years to complete,

25:18.683 --> 25:21.394
but you wanna make sure
that your performance is right.

25:21.478 --> 25:24.231
You have to keep practising and practising

25:24.314 --> 25:28.818
and making sure
people believe that it’s real magic.

25:29.569 --> 25:31.488
The magic of science.

25:31.571 --> 25:35.492
Fun fact!

25:36.618 --> 25:39.996
Did you know that the Earth
is a giant magnet?

25:40.080 --> 25:41.498
Isn’t that wild?

25:45.293 --> 25:48.547
Wasn’t that cool? Science is the best!
