WEBVTT

00:11.480 --> 00:14.563
These hunters are out of control,
the brothers Winchester in particular,

00:14.720 --> 00:17.883
<i>which Lady Bevell
has exhaustively documented.</i>

00:19.440 --> 00:23.445
The grand experiment
of recruiting American hunters has failed.

00:25.480 --> 00:26.766
What would you like me to do?

00:27.000 --> 00:28.126
Exterminate them.

00:28.600 --> 00:31.331
<i>Every last one.</i>

00:32.040 --> 00:34.964
CASTIEL: <i>This is not a baby.
This is the spawn of Lucifer.</i>

00:35.600 --> 00:37.250
- SAM: <i>Cass!</i>
- DEAN: <i>No!</i>

00:37.400 --> 00:42.042
CASTIEL: <i>And I know now that this child
must be born with all of his power.</i>

00:42.800 --> 00:46.122
MR. KETCH: <i>Dr. Hess wants to know
everything about the Winchesters.</i>

00:46.400 --> 00:49.051
MARY: <i>Sorry I couldn't pick up before.
I've been on a hunt with Ketch.</i>

00:49.200 --> 00:51.328
MARY: <i>Dean, we've got a problem.</i>

00:51.520 --> 00:52.646
What are you doing here?

00:52.880 --> 00:54.928
It's the end for the American hunters.

00:55.400 --> 00:59.962
But I can keep you safe, if you play nice.

01:01.320 --> 01:02.446
I don't play nice.

01:55.280 --> 01:57.169
Good puppy.

02:24.640 --> 02:25.641
Mom?

02:29.240 --> 02:30.241
Mom?

02:37.800 --> 02:39.564
Well, looks like
she hasn't been here for a while.

02:39.800 --> 02:41.882
Yeah. All her stuff is gone.

02:42.400 --> 02:44.607
Did she say she was moving on or...

02:44.760 --> 02:46.046
No, I told you what she said, She said.

02:46.200 --> 02:47.770
"Dean, call me. We have a problem."

02:47.920 --> 02:49.251
And then that was it.
She didn't sound happy.

02:49.400 --> 02:52.643
Okay, well, when she's not here, she's
been bunking with the Brits. So maybe...

02:52.800 --> 02:54.768
Well, dude, I've called Mick,
like, six times.

02:54.920 --> 02:57.764
He's been radio silent since
they sent him to London.

03:01.560 --> 03:04.609
Ketch, calling to
see if my mom's with you.

03:05.600 --> 03:07.250
It's Dean.

03:08.160 --> 03:09.161
Winchester.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.002
Because I'd like to speak to her,
that's why.

03:13.960 --> 03:15.849
No, I'm not being terse.
Look, if you haven't seen her,

03:16.040 --> 03:17.246
do you know where she is?

03:17.560 --> 03:18.971
<i>No, I'm not being curt either.</i>

03:19.160 --> 03:21.288
<i>Look, I don't have time for
Manners 101 from you, okay?</i>

03:21.600 --> 03:23.443
If she's with you,
I want to know about it.

03:25.520 --> 03:26.567
Fine!

03:27.280 --> 03:29.009
- Such a dick.
- And?

03:29.600 --> 03:30.886
He says he hasn't seen Mom in over a week.

03:31.040 --> 03:33.407
But Mom called two days ago,
said she was working a case with him.

03:34.280 --> 03:36.886
- Which means he's lying.
- But why would he...

03:39.720 --> 03:40.721
Jody.

03:41.600 --> 03:45.366
Jody, hey. No, what?

03:46.040 --> 03:47.405
No, uh...

03:48.160 --> 03:50.083
<i>- No, we hadn't heard.</i>
- Mom?

03:51.360 --> 03:54.170
Um, when? What the hell happened?

03:56.320 --> 03:58.129
<i>Oh, no. No, I...</i>

03:58.280 --> 03:59.691
<i>Yeah, thanks for letting me know.</i>

04:00.440 --> 04:02.090
- Bye.
- Who?

04:03.040 --> 04:04.041
Eileen.

04:08.040 --> 04:09.849
- How?
<i>- She was, um...</i>

04:10.200 --> 04:12.567
Mauled by a wild animal in a wooded area

04:12.760 --> 04:14.205
that doesn't have animals that do that,

04:14.440 --> 04:15.805
<i>in South Carolina.</i>

04:16.000 --> 04:17.081
But I thought she was in Ireland.

04:22.160 --> 04:23.207
Sam...

04:25.200 --> 04:28.363
Dean, that's the second hunter death
we've heard about in two weeks.

04:28.680 --> 04:29.681
I know.

04:30.040 --> 04:31.690
But two doesn't mean a pattern.

04:32.840 --> 04:34.046
- Three would.
- Meaning?

04:35.920 --> 04:37.365
Mom is a hunter.

04:38.160 --> 04:39.491
And no one knows where she is.

04:54.960 --> 04:56.485
People who do what we do...

04:57.880 --> 05:02.329
You know there are gonna be deaths,
but this...

05:05.800 --> 05:08.770
These wounds, I mean, we've only seen
something this bad a few times.

05:09.360 --> 05:11.169
- Hellhound?
- Yeah.

05:11.920 --> 05:14.366
But it doesn't make any sense.
Why would a... Why would a demon

05:14.600 --> 05:15.761
sic a Hellhound on her?

05:16.400 --> 05:18.402
- Why did she leave Ireland?
- I don't know, Dean.

05:20.080 --> 05:21.411
All right, well, counting Eileen,

05:21.680 --> 05:24.365
that makes seven hunters in three weeks.

05:24.520 --> 05:25.931
Yeah, and those are
the ones we know about.

05:26.080 --> 05:28.651
Seven monster-related deaths.

05:29.240 --> 05:32.369
I mean, what, did all the things out there
suddenly start working together?

05:32.600 --> 05:34.204
Dean, monsters and demons don't team up.

05:34.440 --> 05:36.010
<i>Seven hunters are gone.</i>

05:36.440 --> 05:37.771
We can't grab a signal from Mom's phone.

05:37.920 --> 05:40.127
Cass has Kelly Kline who knows where.

05:40.520 --> 05:43.285
Mick has slipped off the grid.
Ketch is lying to us. I...

05:45.120 --> 05:47.600
- I want to punch something in the face.
- Good.

05:48.800 --> 05:50.245
Hold on to that.

05:50.920 --> 05:52.922
'Cause it looks like we got
a Hellhound to deal with.

05:53.640 --> 05:54.641
<i>Which means...</i>

05:55.320 --> 05:58.608
How many times do I have to repeat myself?

05:59.280 --> 06:01.601
Find me Kelly Kline!

06:02.600 --> 06:06.571
As a concept,
it's ridiculously simple, as are you!

06:06.800 --> 06:08.450
Please don't yell. I'm trying.

06:08.600 --> 06:10.728
"I'm trying"? Well, try harder!

06:10.960 --> 06:13.645
As if your almost-life depended on it.

06:13.840 --> 06:14.841
Yes, my king.

06:15.680 --> 06:17.887
Bear down. What do you know?

06:18.120 --> 06:20.043
We know Dagon is dead
and can't protect Kelly.

06:20.320 --> 06:22.243
Which makes your task even easier.

06:22.480 --> 06:24.050
We know Lucifer's son is almost due.

06:24.320 --> 06:26.448
Which makes your task more crucial.

06:26.640 --> 06:29.041
We know we don't know how
powerful he'll be when born.

06:29.440 --> 06:30.566
Which makes you an idiot.

06:31.320 --> 06:32.481
- I know that, too.
<i>- Apparently,</i>

06:32.880 --> 06:34.803
you and the legion of demons

06:34.960 --> 06:39.010
that I've assigned to this task
haven't been motivated properly.

06:40.440 --> 06:42.568
- Follow me.
- You're going to skin me alive, sire?

06:42.760 --> 06:44.250
Would it be that simple.

06:44.840 --> 06:47.764
I have to remind
you and your team of screw-ups

06:47.960 --> 06:50.167
of the pride of superior work,

06:50.320 --> 06:52.004
the thrill of pleasing me,

06:52.680 --> 06:55.684
and the gratification
of living one more day.

07:11.760 --> 07:12.841
MARY: Hello, Rick.

07:14.640 --> 07:16.210
Mary?

07:18.520 --> 07:19.760
No, please come in. Have a seat.

07:20.680 --> 07:21.841
Thanks.

07:22.200 --> 07:24.567
So, you have my address.

07:24.880 --> 07:27.008
- But not my phone number?
- Spur of the moment.

07:27.400 --> 07:29.368
Someone dropped a dime
on a vamp nest near here.

07:29.840 --> 07:30.841
You got anything?

07:31.200 --> 07:32.725
- No, news to me.
- You want in?

07:34.760 --> 07:35.761
Yeah.

07:36.040 --> 07:37.087
- Yeah, sure.
- Great.

07:39.040 --> 07:40.041
How you been?

07:40.800 --> 07:42.245
Well, uh...

07:42.560 --> 07:46.485
Taking plenty of heat from the Brit Dicks
to join the tea and crumpet squad.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.006
Mmm.

07:48.280 --> 07:50.726
Yeah, they do not want to take no
for an answer.

07:51.040 --> 07:52.041
- Really?
- Yeah.

07:52.960 --> 07:55.247
- You want a beer?
- Sure.

07:55.520 --> 07:58.251
I mean, screw them, right?

07:58.840 --> 08:00.763
What do they think,
after all these years...

08:36.080 --> 08:37.570
How are we doing today?

08:39.559 --> 08:40.924
Oh, Mary.

08:41.159 --> 08:42.525
Those eye bags again.

08:43.720 --> 08:45.006
Did something happen last night?

08:45.800 --> 08:47.290
Could you be more specific?

08:47.800 --> 08:49.450
Was I out of this building?

08:49.960 --> 08:51.928
Well, you would know that better than I.

08:54.320 --> 08:57.051
Unless you're having trouble
distinguishing fact from fiction.

08:59.080 --> 09:00.241
So, what's going on, Mary?

09:01.920 --> 09:03.160
I'm fine.

09:10.200 --> 09:11.201
Are you?

09:23.480 --> 09:25.209
You're brainwashing me?

09:29.520 --> 09:31.727
You're being realigned.

09:34.000 --> 09:37.607
<i>Soon, you won't differentiate
between your thinking and ours.</i>

09:38.000 --> 09:40.002
All of your thoughts
and actions will come from us.

09:40.840 --> 09:41.841
What are you talking about?

09:42.120 --> 09:45.920
Well, not about this illusion
of you that you hold on to.

09:46.680 --> 09:47.841
<i>The perfect life.</i>

09:48.920 --> 09:50.251
Loving husband and kids.

09:52.200 --> 09:54.123
But it never really was perfect, was it?

09:55.360 --> 09:57.840
<i>All those secrets you kept from
your beloved John.</i>

09:58.200 --> 09:59.201
That you were a hunter.

10:00.360 --> 10:03.682
That you invited Azazel to visit
when he spared John's life.

10:07.400 --> 10:09.368
- How do you...
<i>- I have sources, Mary.</i>

10:10.480 --> 10:11.481
Everywhere.

10:13.040 --> 10:14.963
After you died, your beloved John

10:15.120 --> 10:18.283
was a man slowly going mad,
searching for revenge.

10:22.280 --> 10:23.770
What? Your boys didn't tell you?

10:24.960 --> 10:26.121
<i>The drunken rages.</i>

10:26.360 --> 10:27.725
<i>The weeks of abandonment.</i>

10:28.360 --> 10:29.486
Child abuse, really.

10:32.240 --> 10:33.571
<i>It's no wonder they're</i>

10:34.040 --> 10:35.041
damaged.

10:38.520 --> 10:42.047
So, enough with the fairy tale.

10:42.280 --> 10:45.284
<i>We are returning you to
a more pure version of yourself.</i>

10:45.640 --> 10:46.641
<i>Mary Campbell.</i>

10:47.200 --> 10:48.531
<i>Natural born killer.</i>

10:48.960 --> 10:49.961
No.

10:51.080 --> 10:54.084
The American hunters haven't fallen
into line as we'd hoped.

10:54.400 --> 10:55.447
So, they're being eliminated.

10:56.080 --> 10:59.562
Repealed and replaced
by our people, and you, Mary.

11:00.400 --> 11:02.846
You play a key role in that.

11:03.200 --> 11:05.248
- I won't.
- Or?

11:08.400 --> 11:09.925
Maybe you already have.

11:15.560 --> 11:16.561
<i>Interesting choice.</i>

11:17.800 --> 11:18.926
Soon you won't be making any.

11:43.920 --> 11:45.331
Good afternoon,

11:46.280 --> 11:47.281
Dr. Hess.

11:49.680 --> 11:52.160
Stunningly beautiful as ever.

11:52.960 --> 11:53.961
Crowley.

11:54.720 --> 11:57.371
Revoltingly unctuous as always.

11:57.720 --> 11:58.721
Let's cut to it.

11:59.720 --> 12:03.008
You have your people slaughtering
the American hunters,

12:03.320 --> 12:04.765
which, naturally, I applaud.

12:04.960 --> 12:05.961
You know about that?

12:06.240 --> 12:08.971
I provided Arthur Ketch with a Hellhound.

12:09.760 --> 12:11.330
I didn't think he was looking for a pet.

12:12.120 --> 12:15.044
<i>Obviously, your organization
is looking to put down roots.</i>

12:15.280 --> 12:16.930
I just want to make doubly sure

12:17.080 --> 12:20.163
that you and I have
the same arrangement in the States

12:20.320 --> 12:21.526
that we do in the UK.

12:21.840 --> 12:23.444
I don't see why not.

12:24.240 --> 12:25.241
No point being at war.

12:25.560 --> 12:26.686
<i>Both sides lose.</i>

12:27.480 --> 12:29.847
<i>If your demons limit their involvement</i>

12:30.080 --> 12:32.811
to humans idiotic
enough to sell their souls.

12:33.040 --> 12:35.168
- Done.
- And share information?

12:35.960 --> 12:36.961
As needed.

12:37.240 --> 12:41.165
I assume finding that
infernal Nephilim is a top priority.

12:41.360 --> 12:46.002
Since it could kill you, me,
and the entire universe, probably.

12:46.240 --> 12:47.730
I am a team player.

12:48.120 --> 12:51.522
My demons are scouring
the country as I speak.

12:52.080 --> 12:53.570
Did you notice my sigh of relief?

12:54.080 --> 12:55.764
Oh, right.

12:56.200 --> 12:57.201
There wasn't one.

13:00.360 --> 13:02.124
Crowley, one more thing.

13:02.480 --> 13:03.527
What?

13:03.720 --> 13:05.722
<i>Your relationship with the Winchesters.</i>

13:06.520 --> 13:08.363
It's a bit cozy for my taste.

13:09.080 --> 13:11.731
I hope you don't expect
me to spare your friends.

13:42.640 --> 13:44.051
That completes my examination.

13:47.320 --> 13:48.446
LUCIFER: <i>Okay, Drexel.</i>

13:48.720 --> 13:51.803
As much as I enjoy playing
doctor with you day after day,

13:52.000 --> 13:53.923
I need to blow this joint now.

13:54.200 --> 13:56.043
I beg you to be patient.

13:56.200 --> 14:00.524
Until I get the security device shut off,
you completely belong to Crowley.

14:00.720 --> 14:02.370
Okay, if it's at minimum power,

14:02.520 --> 14:04.761
and I'm at maximum power,
I'll roll the dice, man.

14:05.320 --> 14:06.924
CROWLEY: <i>I'm telling you,
I don't know anything about it.</i>

14:07.200 --> 14:09.601
The name Eileen Leahy means nothing to me.

14:09.920 --> 14:12.400
SAM: <i>Crowley, only a demon
can control a Hellhound.</i>

14:12.560 --> 14:14.608
Which means that one of
your people was involved.

14:14.800 --> 14:15.801
CROWLEY: <i>If that were the case,</i>

14:16.080 --> 14:18.401
<i>I would know about it.
There are no missing Hellhounds.</i>

14:18.600 --> 14:21.285
- I was cuddling with them just last night.
- SAM: <i>Right.</i>

14:21.440 --> 14:23.442
<i>And you know nothing else of
the other hunters who are dying?</i>

14:24.280 --> 14:27.841
Not only don't I know, I don't care.

14:32.800 --> 14:35.087
Never thought of
you as a cuddler, Crowley.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.001
Tell me more.

14:38.920 --> 14:39.921
More?

14:41.880 --> 14:43.609
I've been giving thought to your future.

14:44.040 --> 14:47.601
As my slave,
you could be useful as a weapon.

14:47.960 --> 14:49.405
Laying waste to my enemies.

14:50.240 --> 14:52.163
Starting with a certain British bitch

14:52.400 --> 14:54.528
who's far too comfortable
giving me ultimatums.

14:55.320 --> 14:56.321
Are you done?

14:57.000 --> 14:58.001
No.

14:58.480 --> 15:00.164
If you do have

15:00.360 --> 15:02.647
<i>any information as to
the whereabouts of Kelly Kline</i>

15:02.880 --> 15:05.326
- and the spawn of your loins...
- Ooh.

15:05.560 --> 15:07.927
You may want to give
that information to me.

15:08.080 --> 15:10.526
And why, oh, why,
would I do a thing like that?

15:10.720 --> 15:12.882
Because, turns out,

15:13.080 --> 15:15.481
that Kelly's been chumming it
with an old friend of yours.

15:16.840 --> 15:18.808
- Dagon.
- So?

15:19.120 --> 15:21.009
<i>So, Dagon dead.</i>

15:24.240 --> 15:27.722
Kelly's now in the clutches of
the Winchesters' love slave, Castiel,

15:28.000 --> 15:30.924
who's, no doubt,
dragging her to a gruesome death.

15:31.480 --> 15:32.720
Mmm.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.207
As opposed to the fun-packed death
you have planned?

15:35.480 --> 15:38.609
My plan may just
be to save your son's life.

15:39.640 --> 15:41.051
<i>Raise him as my own.</i>

15:41.200 --> 15:44.727
Give him the chance to
use his power in my service.

15:47.680 --> 15:52.049
I may be the only hope you
have of seeing him alive.

15:52.360 --> 15:53.486
Mmm.

15:55.360 --> 15:56.850
Interesting.

15:58.480 --> 15:59.891
Pass.

16:00.040 --> 16:01.201
Mmm.

16:02.120 --> 16:04.566
Think about it. Tick-tock.

16:15.720 --> 16:17.961
I need to get out of here, now.

16:52.680 --> 16:56.207
TONI: We just completed another session.
She's coming along nicely.

16:56.440 --> 16:58.761
I know you wanted me to
accelerate her progress, Dr. Hess.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.445
I believe I've achieved that.

17:01.480 --> 17:03.050
That is why you brought me in?

17:08.319 --> 17:11.608
I'm sorry, were you expecting
a pat on the head, your highness?

17:13.960 --> 17:16.440
Oh, no. I would never
expect civility from you.

17:18.560 --> 17:19.891
Psychopath.

17:25.640 --> 17:27.926
- You two are such fun together.
- Mmm.

17:28.760 --> 17:31.491
Of course, she may be reporting to you.

17:34.040 --> 17:36.247
Not really an administrator.

17:37.640 --> 17:39.688
You kill without mercy.

17:39.960 --> 17:41.485
<i>You'll be fine.</i>

17:42.480 --> 17:45.324
I mean, here you are,
watching this woman suffer.

17:46.160 --> 17:48.686
<i>And only days ago,
you were sleeping with her.</i>

17:51.280 --> 17:52.327
<i>Of course I knew.</i>

17:57.400 --> 17:59.164
Once the US hunters are gone,

17:59.480 --> 18:01.881
I'm seriously considering
putting you in charge.

18:02.760 --> 18:04.000
You're too kind.

18:04.840 --> 18:08.970
Of course, Lady Bevell
is also desperate for the job.

18:10.840 --> 18:14.162
Oh, that's right,
you slept with her, as well.

18:21.960 --> 18:24.691
Yeah. Yeah, no, I appreciate it. Thanks.

18:25.280 --> 18:28.841
So, I've been calling around about all
the other hunters that died.

18:29.600 --> 18:31.921
Every one of them had years of experience.

18:32.200 --> 18:35.204
- We got a letter. From Eileen.
- Eileen?

18:35.880 --> 18:37.291
She sent it four days ago.

18:37.600 --> 18:39.284
It went snail mail 'cause
she thought that her phone

18:39.440 --> 18:40.851
and her computer were both hacked.

18:41.040 --> 18:43.168
- She left Ireland because she was scared.
- Scared of what?

18:43.480 --> 18:46.450
Well, after she accidentally
killed that Brit douche, Renny,

18:46.680 --> 18:48.603
she thought that the
British Men of Letters were on her.

18:53.080 --> 18:57.404
"I know they're following me, watching me.
They tapped my phone."

18:58.040 --> 19:00.042
"I found a microphone in my room."

19:02.160 --> 19:04.527
"I hate to be all girly,
but could I bunk with you guys"

19:04.720 --> 19:06.882
"for a few days till I sort this out?""

19:08.760 --> 19:11.240
- You think the Brits were watching her?
- If Eileen says they were...

19:11.440 --> 19:13.647
Then maybe they're
the ones that killed her?

19:24.400 --> 19:25.765
Ugh.

20:30.920 --> 20:33.491
Those hunters you were talking to,
was one of them Terry Marsh?

20:34.960 --> 20:36.564
Yeah, Terry Marsh, from Missouri.
I talked to him.

20:36.760 --> 20:39.445
He's also thinking it's not monsters
doing the real killing.

20:39.640 --> 20:41.005
DEAN: <i>Okay, well, I got a text from him.</i>

20:41.760 --> 20:44.604
<i>He's been nosing around. Says he's got
a fair idea of what's going on.</i>

20:44.960 --> 20:46.007
SAM: <i>And?</i>

20:46.240 --> 20:48.846
DEAN: <i>He doesn't feel safe talking
about it on the phone. He wants to meet.</i>

20:49.560 --> 20:51.085
<i>The old iron works off the interstate.</i>

20:51.320 --> 20:55.120
Tomorrow night at 9:00. He says
park off the road, by the warehouse.

20:55.520 --> 20:56.646
All right.

21:00.080 --> 21:02.606
DREXEL: <i>Well, the timing of your
escape is crucial, my lord.</i>

21:02.800 --> 21:05.201
<i>If the device isn't sufficiently impaired,</i>

21:05.520 --> 21:07.363
<i>the king's hold on you will only increase.</i>

21:07.680 --> 21:11.480
<i>And of course, I'll be...</i>

21:12.320 --> 21:14.288
Let me be perfectly clear, okay?

21:16.120 --> 21:19.886
My only son is in jeopardy
and I'm running out of patience.

21:21.320 --> 21:22.526
Check it again.

21:33.720 --> 21:36.200
This can't be.

21:36.520 --> 21:38.045
Do not tell me it's powering up.

21:38.280 --> 21:40.681
- It's powering up.
- I asked you not to tell me that.

21:40.880 --> 21:43.406
But in the opposite direction.

21:43.760 --> 21:45.250
- This is amazing!
- What?

21:45.480 --> 21:49.405
The device.
It's cemented directly into your DNA

21:49.680 --> 21:51.444
and that of the king's.

21:53.880 --> 21:58.522
As it's powering down in you,
the polarity is somehow reversing.

21:59.240 --> 22:00.844
English, Drexel.

22:01.160 --> 22:04.369
The ability to control is transferring.

22:04.840 --> 22:07.320
From Crowley to you.

22:10.560 --> 22:14.690
So, you're saying
that Crowley's gonna be my puppet?

22:18.240 --> 22:21.449
Good dog! You sat for Lady Bevell.

22:27.840 --> 22:29.444
How can you even tell?

22:31.200 --> 22:34.204
Am I going to say "bad dog"?
He can be unpleasant.

22:37.880 --> 22:41.965
Dr. Hess says that you have
designs on Mick Davies' job.

22:43.080 --> 22:44.445
Did she?

22:44.600 --> 22:47.251
She assured me it was mine to turn down.

22:48.240 --> 22:49.605
Fascinating.

22:49.920 --> 22:51.331
She told me the same thing.

22:56.200 --> 22:58.123
Well,

22:58.320 --> 23:01.688
pitted against each other.
Like our days at Kendricks.

23:02.640 --> 23:04.802
I always did rather
well in those situations.

23:04.960 --> 23:06.485
You slaughtered the competition.

23:08.120 --> 23:09.645
Sometimes literally.

23:10.040 --> 23:12.771
And yet, I never slaughtered you, Ketch.

23:13.640 --> 23:17.247
Well, we were having
a lot of sex at the time.

23:19.720 --> 23:23.327
I've been studying the American situation
and how to fix it for years.

23:23.800 --> 23:25.006
<i>So, this</i>

23:25.520 --> 23:26.646
is mine.

23:28.880 --> 23:30.291
Trust me.

23:31.000 --> 23:32.445
The cream always rises to the top.

23:33.200 --> 23:35.851
Oh, I agree.

23:36.120 --> 23:38.327
WOMAN: <i>Mr. Ketch?
The prisoner's asking for you.</i>

23:40.680 --> 23:42.170
Huh.

23:47.040 --> 23:48.565
Arrogant bastard.

23:50.920 --> 23:53.321
Lady Bevell. I have news.

24:22.160 --> 24:23.491
I didn't think you'd come.

24:37.920 --> 24:40.890
I'm losing my mind, Ketch.

24:42.120 --> 24:45.408
I actually don't know if this is real.

24:49.920 --> 24:51.490
What do they want me to do?

24:51.920 --> 24:56.721
Exactly what you're doing, Mary.
And you're doing it splendidly.

24:58.880 --> 25:00.166
I killed somebody.

25:03.400 --> 25:05.164
He was a friend.

25:06.880 --> 25:08.245
I do it all the time.

25:13.400 --> 25:15.607
I believed in what you people were doing.

25:17.400 --> 25:20.370
I fought with you so that
my boys could maybe

25:21.080 --> 25:23.128
live in a world without monsters.

25:24.840 --> 25:27.810
- How can you...
- I'm not sure what you're expecting.

25:30.000 --> 25:31.286
That I'll intervene?

25:32.120 --> 25:35.283
We made it clear to each other
we don't have a relationship.

25:38.400 --> 25:41.722
We work together. We...

25:47.120 --> 25:48.645
We know each other.

25:48.840 --> 25:50.410
I don't know you, Mary. Not really.

25:54.440 --> 25:56.090
You certainly don't know me.

25:57.920 --> 26:00.161
You wouldn't want to.

26:04.360 --> 26:06.169
I need your help.

26:10.360 --> 26:12.203
Please.

26:14.480 --> 26:16.164
Mary!

26:21.440 --> 26:24.284
Then you do it! Kill me!

26:30.000 --> 26:34.210
All my life, all I ever had,
other than my family,

26:35.680 --> 26:37.444
was my will.

26:38.240 --> 26:40.242
And it's going away!

26:42.600 --> 26:44.329
I'm...

26:44.680 --> 26:49.049
I'm putting people in danger.
I'm putting my sons in danger!

26:51.480 --> 26:53.369
<i>You have to...</i>

26:53.840 --> 26:55.524
Please.

26:56.280 --> 26:59.762
For God's sake. Kill me.

26:59.960 --> 27:02.008
- <i>Mary.</i>
- Just do it!

27:02.360 --> 27:04.681
<i>Mary. Listen to me.</i>

27:05.000 --> 27:06.286
It won't be long now.

27:07.440 --> 27:11.570
This will all be over.

27:12.440 --> 27:13.805
<i>I promise.</i>

27:14.240 --> 27:16.083
- No.
<i>- I promise.</i>

27:16.640 --> 27:19.291
No.

27:27.760 --> 27:28.886
Don't.

29:16.440 --> 29:18.807
You keep that up,
we're gonna have to start dating.

29:28.040 --> 29:30.964
Before long, of course,
I will get rid of you.

29:31.960 --> 29:34.201
But I will miss our little chats.

29:34.680 --> 29:39.402
Hmm. You mean the ones where you prattle
on about your imagined power,

29:39.560 --> 29:41.562
and I pretend to care?

29:42.040 --> 29:43.087
Those chats?

29:44.840 --> 29:47.605
How is Lucifer Junior? Dead yet?

29:51.560 --> 29:54.086
Mmm, no. Still alive and kicking.

29:54.560 --> 29:56.244
Strong.

29:56.520 --> 29:58.329
Kid's a bruiser. Sort of proud.

29:58.560 --> 30:00.688
Well, before you book
a Daddy-and-Me class,

30:00.840 --> 30:04.049
I must assure you there is
no heir to your throne.

30:04.200 --> 30:07.124
<i>The Winchesters
wouldn't mess up a second time.</i>

30:07.360 --> 30:09.886
I don't know about that.
Seems to be sort of their thing.

30:10.040 --> 30:12.646
I mean, they thought they would stuff me
back in the Cage, again.

30:12.880 --> 30:15.929
And yet, due to my cunning, here you sit.

30:16.280 --> 30:19.523
<i>A virtual slave to my will.</i>

30:23.680 --> 30:24.841
And the hubris,

30:25.200 --> 30:27.771
you and your pseudo son?

30:27.920 --> 30:30.321
<i>I mean, it's delusional.</i>

30:30.640 --> 30:34.850
Despite your epic collapse,

30:35.160 --> 30:40.007
<i>you persist in the fantasy
that you will best me.</i>

30:42.800 --> 30:45.849
Your bluster is no match
for my masterful strategies.

30:47.040 --> 30:52.046
And, in the end,
you will have to concede that I...

30:53.920 --> 30:55.160
What's going on?

31:00.400 --> 31:02.607
"Master strategist."

31:03.160 --> 31:06.130
More like, Kermit the Frog.

31:12.360 --> 31:14.283
Oh, my little Muppet.

31:16.120 --> 31:18.327
Crowley, what will I do without you?

31:21.600 --> 31:23.011
Why are you spying on us?

31:23.480 --> 31:24.561
Oh, and what do you know

31:24.720 --> 31:26.688
- about Eileen Leahy?
- Who?

31:27.320 --> 31:30.324
Did you... Did your people...
Did they kill her?

31:30.960 --> 31:32.246
Probably.

31:34.520 --> 31:35.567
<i>Rule of thumb.</i>

31:35.720 --> 31:38.644
If you think we killed someone,
then we probably did.

31:39.760 --> 31:42.161
Speaking of, you do realize that
by attacking me,

31:42.320 --> 31:45.369
you invite the retribution
of the entire British Men of Letters.

31:45.520 --> 31:49.161
No investigation, no trial,
just punishment and ruin.

31:50.000 --> 31:53.163
Possibly at the hands of Mary Winchester.

31:54.240 --> 31:55.605
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

31:55.760 --> 31:56.841
TONI: <i>Your mother,</i>

31:57.000 --> 31:59.002
she's our permanent guest.

31:59.160 --> 32:00.491
She's a prisoner?

32:00.640 --> 32:02.165
- Why?
- TONI: <i>Prisoner?</i>

32:02.560 --> 32:03.846
<i>Who said anything about prisoner?</i>

32:04.080 --> 32:05.923
No, Mary's joined the team.

32:06.160 --> 32:08.367
Even has her own super-secret
decoderflng.

32:08.560 --> 32:10.085
You're lying.

32:10.280 --> 32:12.442
You're right. There is no ring.

32:14.480 --> 32:15.891
Boys and their mums.

32:16.320 --> 32:17.970
See, you see her as Mummy,

32:18.160 --> 32:20.322
we see her as one of our best killers.

32:20.480 --> 32:23.086
You know, just 'cause she works with
Ketch doesn't mean she likes him.

32:24.280 --> 32:27.250
- Or you.
- Oh, that Oedipal myopia again.

32:28.040 --> 32:29.883
And did you really think she was just

32:30.200 --> 32:32.089
<i>working with Ketch?</i>

32:33.200 --> 32:35.885
<i>- All of those days and nights...</i>
- That's enough.

32:36.400 --> 32:38.562
He said it was some of the best sex
he'd ever had.

32:42.760 --> 32:44.205
You want to rethink that?

32:44.800 --> 32:45.881
Fine.

32:46.400 --> 32:48.562
He said it was the best sex
he'd ever had.

32:48.800 --> 32:50.040
Dean, Dean!

32:50.360 --> 32:51.771
- SAM: All right.
- Keep it up.

32:52.400 --> 32:54.209
What about Mick?
Where is he in all of this?

32:54.360 --> 32:55.646
- TONI: <i>Mick?</i>
- Yes, Mick.

32:55.800 --> 32:56.961
Oh, Mick's dead.

32:59.160 --> 33:00.321
He's dead?

33:00.680 --> 33:01.761
Quite.

33:02.240 --> 33:04.322
It was determined
he was too sentimental for the job.

33:05.240 --> 33:07.368
<i>Turns out he was too much like you two.</i>

33:07.520 --> 33:09.124
<i>And all the other US hunters.</i>

33:09.280 --> 33:13.001
Ergo, soon each and every hunter
in this country will join him.

33:13.920 --> 33:16.161
<i>Jody Mills. Claire Novak.</i>

33:17.200 --> 33:19.009
<i>All of your other flannel-wearing,</i>

33:19.240 --> 33:21.049
whiskey-swilling friends,

33:21.680 --> 33:22.966
they're dead.

33:34.600 --> 33:35.601
Ooh.

33:36.440 --> 33:38.442
Damn, that feels awesome.

33:40.640 --> 33:42.051
Muscle cramps.

33:43.120 --> 33:44.724
You know a good Pilates class?

33:46.600 --> 33:48.762
So, to be clear,

33:49.440 --> 33:51.488
I accept that you are

33:51.800 --> 33:53.450
<i>now in charge.</i>

33:53.760 --> 33:56.240
I like this new arrangement better.

33:56.720 --> 33:58.449
You're more the big picture guy,

33:59.200 --> 34:01.646
<i>I'm the day-to-day</i>

34:01.800 --> 34:03.882
minutiae guy.

34:22.920 --> 34:24.409
Eight ball, corner pocket.

34:27.560 --> 34:30.210
Well, I could do this all day.
But since I'm king,

34:30.520 --> 34:31.567
<i>et cetera, et cetera,</i>

34:32.520 --> 34:33.885
I'll wrap it up.

35:29.240 --> 35:31.971
Oh, you had to know this was inevitable.

35:42.080 --> 35:43.525
This is gonna hurt.

36:14.920 --> 36:16.524
Clean up on aisle seven.

36:27.720 --> 36:28.801
We're clear?

36:29.200 --> 36:31.282
You call Ketch,
tell him if he wants to see you alive,

36:31.440 --> 36:33.408
he gets his prissy ass over here.

36:35.680 --> 36:38.923
Interestingly, his prissy arse
is already here.

36:44.000 --> 36:47.209
Lady Bevell,
would you mind disarming them?

37:22.360 --> 37:24.044
- Get up.
- SAM: <i>All right, Ketch.</i>

37:24.200 --> 37:25.929
How many more guys are in here?

37:26.120 --> 37:28.521
Our mom. Where is she?

37:32.320 --> 37:33.685
Don't move.

37:34.840 --> 37:36.080
Ah! Speak of the devil.

37:36.240 --> 37:37.685
Perfect timing, Mom.

37:38.520 --> 37:40.045
Just stay where you are.

37:40.360 --> 37:41.885
Hey! You heard her.

37:42.040 --> 37:43.451
I was talking to you.

37:45.360 --> 37:46.407
Mom?

37:49.200 --> 37:51.248
Right, Ketch, stop!

37:51.400 --> 37:52.890
I really wouldn't move.

37:53.120 --> 37:55.043
She will shoot you.

38:12.040 --> 38:14.361
Mummy always was a talented hunter.

38:14.680 --> 38:17.570
Just somewhat confused
about obeying orders.

38:17.880 --> 38:19.120
What did you do to her?

38:19.560 --> 38:23.087
Lady Bevell cleared up that confusion.

38:23.240 --> 38:26.369
<i>And I suspect she told you
that the American hunters</i>

38:26.520 --> 38:28.682
are a dying breed.

38:30.560 --> 38:31.561
Hmm?

38:35.560 --> 38:36.561
Oh.

38:36.760 --> 38:38.569
For heaven's sake,
where do you think you're going?

38:38.720 --> 38:40.768
- Ketch?
<i>- Remember, at Kendricks,</i>

38:40.960 --> 38:43.691
how they taught us that
we were all expendable?

38:44.320 --> 38:45.765
<i>That wasn't idle chat.</i>

38:48.360 --> 38:49.407
Mom?

38:51.560 --> 38:52.721
Look at me.

38:54.720 --> 38:56.609
It's us, please.

38:56.760 --> 38:58.808
<i>What's wrong with you? Mom!</i>

39:00.240 --> 39:03.210
Your bunker is an excellent fortress.

39:04.120 --> 39:05.770
An even better tomb.

39:06.400 --> 39:10.371
<i>So, we've re-jiggered the locks,
we've shut off the water,</i>

39:10.520 --> 39:14.525
and once we leave, the pumps
that bring in the air shall reverse.

39:16.240 --> 39:21.087
Your oxygen should be gone in
two days, maybe three.

39:24.280 --> 39:27.966
<i>You dying in here,</i>

39:28.720 --> 39:32.406
it's almost poetic.

39:38.280 --> 39:39.611
Come along, Mary.

39:39.760 --> 39:40.886
Ketch!

39:50.840 --> 39:52.205
No!

40:06.840 --> 40:08.888
He wants this done before he returns.

40:09.480 --> 40:11.642
What are we supposed to do with that?

40:15.520 --> 40:16.726
Toss it.

40:33.200 --> 40:35.771
I do have to hand it to Lady Bevell.

40:36.000 --> 40:40.688
Your treatment's been
most successful, so far.

40:42.280 --> 40:47.446
And so you know, this will become easier.

40:50.200 --> 40:53.886
Easier to hurt people I love?

40:57.040 --> 41:02.331
Easier to hurt people
you don't remember loving.

41:05.200 --> 41:06.645
<i>How do you feel?</i>

41:10.680 --> 41:11.841
Fine.

41:13.840 --> 41:15.251
I'm fine.

41:36.400 --> 41:38.004
My son.
