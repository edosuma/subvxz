Ollie! How much longer?

00:34.800 --> 00:36.800
Two minutes
till PawPaw gets here.

00:36.920 --> 00:40.080
Two minutes? I don't know
if I can wait that long.

00:41.320 --> 00:42.919
I have the hugest craving

00:43.040 --> 00:46.519
for those little Greek
almond cookies he always brings!

00:46.640 --> 00:47.640
So sweet!

00:47.760 --> 00:49.239
So crumbly!

00:49.440 --> 00:51.839
That reminds me.
Better get ready.

00:54.400 --> 00:55.400
For cleaning!

00:55.519 --> 00:56.960
[knock on door]
Huh?

00:57.480 --> 00:59.839
-Hello!
-PawPaw!

00:59.959 --> 01:03.199
Well, if it isn't
my favourite granddaughter

01:03.400 --> 01:05.039
and my favourite Ollie!

01:05.399 --> 01:07.679
And our favourite
world-travelling salescat!

01:07.880 --> 01:10.720
Where are you hiding the cookies
this time, PawPaw?

01:10.920 --> 01:11.759
Ha, ha! Moon!

01:11.880 --> 01:13.039
[giggles]

01:13.160 --> 01:14.119
No, no, no.

01:14.320 --> 01:17.479
I'm afraid
I have bad news, Moon.

01:17.600 --> 01:19.600
I'm all out
of Greek almond cookies!

01:19.720 --> 01:20.640
[gasps]

01:20.759 --> 01:22.880
-Really?
-Moon's having a cookie craving.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.679
Oh! Well, don't fret. Let's see.

01:25.880 --> 01:30.759
My organiser says my next
delivery to Greece is in...

01:30.880 --> 01:31.720
three weeks.

01:31.839 --> 01:33.039
Three weeks?

01:33.160 --> 01:36.080
But I'll never be able to wait
that long!

01:36.199 --> 01:37.039
[gasps]

01:37.160 --> 01:38.440
But I won't have to!

01:38.640 --> 01:41.240
Because I'm having a brainstorm!

01:42.560 --> 01:45.280
Looks like I'm about to get
dragged off somewhere.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.640
-Ready!
-You'll find the cookies

01:48.759 --> 01:51.000
on the island of Hydra.

01:51.119 --> 01:53.280
I'll make some deliveries
here in Brooklyn

01:53.399 --> 01:55.119
and meet you back here tomorrow.

01:55.240 --> 01:57.679
Would you like us to take
your delivery to Greece

01:57.800 --> 01:59.559
-while we're there?
-Wonderful!

01:59.679 --> 02:00.919
It'll arrive early!

02:01.039 --> 02:03.240
I'll just go get it from my van!

02:05.000 --> 02:06.199
Thanks, you two!

02:06.320 --> 02:08.799
Say hi
to Mr. Papadopoulos for me!

02:08.919 --> 02:10.359
You bet, PawPaw!

02:10.479 --> 02:12.920
But, Moon, how are we going
to get this box to the--

02:13.040 --> 02:13.880
Taxi!

02:20.200 --> 02:21.359
Whoo!

02:22.160 --> 02:23.640
Whee!

02:32.160 --> 02:34.880
<i>Now arriving in Greece.</i>

02:38.600 --> 02:41.040
I wonder...
what the best way is...

02:41.160 --> 02:42.040
[groans]

02:42.160 --> 02:43.320
...to get to the island.

02:43.440 --> 02:45.120
No time for research, Ollie.

02:45.239 --> 02:46.720
He looks fast.

02:47.239 --> 02:50.000
-Let's go with him!
-Waah!

02:51.120 --> 02:52.160
Whoa!

02:53.320 --> 02:54.320
Moon, wait!

02:54.440 --> 02:56.320
Let's ask around
for travel tips first

02:56.440 --> 02:57.280
and get a map!

02:57.400 --> 03:00.519
Ollie! Hurry!
We don't need a map!

03:00.640 --> 03:03.959
No map? Ooh, adventurers!

03:04.720 --> 03:06.040
You've come to the right place!

03:10.600 --> 03:12.959
I'm Yannis. Let me help you!

03:13.079 --> 03:15.320
I'm Ollie. And yes, please!

03:18.519 --> 03:21.320
Welcome aboard the Monkey-ing
Around Adventure Boat!

03:21.640 --> 03:26.200
It's the longest, wildest ride
to Hydra you'll ever take!

03:26.560 --> 03:29.040
-Wait. Longest?
-Wait. Wildest?

03:32.200 --> 03:34.359
Ah! Adventure ho!

03:34.959 --> 03:38.000
Why didn't we stop to ask
about a less adventure-y...

03:38.679 --> 03:40.880
less woogly, less...

03:42.160 --> 03:43.000
boat?

03:43.119 --> 03:45.640
And now the fun really begins!

03:45.760 --> 03:46.640
[laughs]

03:48.799 --> 03:50.040
[screaming]

03:51.160 --> 03:52.880
Oh, no! The box!

03:56.880 --> 03:57.799
Aaah!

03:57.920 --> 03:59.040
[screaming]

04:08.320 --> 04:10.040
Hydra island in view!

04:12.760 --> 04:14.000
Finally!

04:14.119 --> 04:15.079
Phew!

04:15.200 --> 04:16.440
That was close!

04:16.560 --> 04:20.399
At least I really worked up
my appetite for those cookies!

04:24.360 --> 04:25.200
[gasps]

04:25.320 --> 04:26.920
It's breathtaking!

04:27.080 --> 04:29.479
It's beautiful! It's...

04:29.599 --> 04:31.560
How would you describe it,
Ollie?

04:31.760 --> 04:34.360
Large. Square. Brown.

04:34.479 --> 04:36.640
Well, I'd call it breathtaking.

04:36.760 --> 04:40.240
And now? Let's get some cookies!

04:40.560 --> 04:42.719
Moon,
aren't you forgetting something?

04:44.120 --> 04:45.560
Like PawPaw's delivery?

04:46.039 --> 04:46.960
[embarrassed laugh]

04:47.479 --> 04:49.159
It says on this sticker

04:49.280 --> 04:51.840
that all deliveries must be made
before three o'clock.

04:51.960 --> 04:53.159
So we better hurry.

04:53.280 --> 04:55.200
Right. Taxi!

04:56.479 --> 04:58.080
Taxi!

04:58.640 --> 04:59.719
Taxi!

05:00.520 --> 05:01.960
Uh... Moon?

05:02.080 --> 05:03.159
One minute, Ollie.

05:03.280 --> 05:04.520
I'm trying to get us a taxi.

05:07.159 --> 05:09.800
I don't get it.
What's that supposed to mean?

05:09.919 --> 05:12.919
It means there are no cars
on the island.

05:13.039 --> 05:14.520
Everyone walks here!

05:16.080 --> 05:17.800
No cars? What?

05:17.919 --> 05:20.039
Well, how was I supposed
to know that?

05:20.240 --> 05:22.400
We might have found out
if we'd taken a minute

05:22.520 --> 05:25.280
to get travel tips
instead of rushing off.

05:25.400 --> 05:28.200
So how are we supposed
to carry the box, then?

05:28.320 --> 05:29.359
-Are there trucks?
-No.

05:29.479 --> 05:30.599
-Buses?
-No.

05:30.760 --> 05:31.800
-Motorcycles?
-No.

05:31.919 --> 05:32.919
-Scooters?
-No.

05:33.039 --> 05:34.039
-Mules?
-Yes!

05:34.159 --> 05:35.120
-Where?
-There!

05:37.800 --> 05:39.120
-Thanks!
-You're welcome.

05:43.800 --> 05:46.080
Hello! We need a mule, please!

05:46.320 --> 05:50.080
Of course, let me tell you
a little about them.

05:50.280 --> 05:51.440
Now this one...

05:51.560 --> 05:53.640
Is perfect! We'll take him.

05:54.320 --> 05:55.840
Are you sure?

05:55.960 --> 05:58.640
This one can be a little bit...

05:58.760 --> 05:59.960
He's perfect, thanks!

06:00.080 --> 06:01.280
We're in a big hurry!

06:01.400 --> 06:02.520
Wait a minute.

06:02.640 --> 06:05.120
Shouldn't we ask which mule
is the most cooperative?

06:05.240 --> 06:07.120
Nah. This one looks strong.

06:07.240 --> 06:08.919
Now let's make PawPaw's delivery

06:09.039 --> 06:12.320
before my cookie craving
gets any worse, OK?

06:15.560 --> 06:16.760
[Moon] See, Ollie?

06:16.880 --> 06:20.039
Aren't you glad we didn't
waste time researching?

06:20.520 --> 06:22.240
This mule is great!

06:22.359 --> 06:26.080
We'll have this delivery
checked off the list super fast

06:26.200 --> 06:28.640
and then it's cookie time...
Whoa!

06:28.840 --> 06:31.400
What's wrong? Why'd he stop?
Why'd you stop?

06:34.520 --> 06:36.280
Let's go!

06:36.479 --> 06:38.000
[panting]

06:46.120 --> 06:46.960
Listen, Mister.

06:47.080 --> 06:50.000
Someone's about to get
a time out.

06:50.560 --> 06:51.400
[sighs]

06:51.840 --> 06:54.680
OK, woodums wittle mule.

06:54.799 --> 06:57.200
Time to make da dewivawy.

06:59.719 --> 07:00.960
[sighs]

07:01.120 --> 07:04.919
If I don't deliver this box,
I don't get my cookies!

07:05.039 --> 07:07.919
And you don't want to see me
without my cookies!

07:10.239 --> 07:14.159
Argh! Why won't you move?

07:14.280 --> 07:16.479
Maybe we should try
shouting his name.

07:16.599 --> 07:18.560
Let's go...

07:18.680 --> 07:21.200
Stubborn Stephanos!

07:21.680 --> 07:24.280
Wait. Stubborn Stephanos?

07:24.400 --> 07:25.520
[Ollie] Moon!

07:25.640 --> 07:29.120
We could've had Gentle Georgios

07:29.239 --> 07:31.599
or Fuzzy Wuzzy McSweetikins,

07:31.840 --> 07:35.520
and you rushed off
with Stubborn Stephanos?

07:35.640 --> 07:37.320
I was in a hurry!

07:37.440 --> 07:40.719
OK. We need a new plan.

07:40.919 --> 07:43.120
Time to give me the address.

07:43.239 --> 07:44.080
Address?

07:44.200 --> 07:46.120
Yes. The delivery address

07:46.239 --> 07:47.960
for Mr. Papadopoulos.

07:48.080 --> 07:49.680
Uh... Mmm.

07:50.320 --> 07:51.840
You don't have the address?

07:53.320 --> 07:57.239
I figured when we got a ways
up the road we'd ask somebody.

07:57.359 --> 07:59.000
I didn't get it from PawPaw

07:59.120 --> 08:03.880
'cause he always takes
so long with his organiser.

08:04.000 --> 08:07.440
But PawPaw's organiser
is the best thing ever!

08:07.560 --> 08:08.880
It keeps him organised!

08:09.000 --> 08:11.400
And not standing
in the middle of an island

08:11.520 --> 08:12.919
with a giant box,

08:13.039 --> 08:15.760
no address
and a mule that won't move!

08:15.880 --> 08:16.880
[gasps]

08:17.000 --> 08:17.960
Where'd he go?

08:18.080 --> 08:22.159
Oh, Ollie, we've lost the mule
<i>and </i>PawPaw's box!

08:22.280 --> 08:23.120
Yup!

08:23.239 --> 08:25.200
I wanted those cookies so badly

08:25.400 --> 08:27.919
I rushed around
and ruined everything.

08:28.039 --> 08:28.880
Yup!

08:29.000 --> 08:30.799
You must be so upset with me.

08:30.919 --> 08:32.240
Yup! But...

08:32.360 --> 08:33.799
I know what it's like
to have a craving.

08:33.919 --> 08:35.039
It's all you can think about.

08:35.159 --> 08:37.400
So I'll help you find that mule

08:37.520 --> 08:39.640
<i>and </i>get your cookies, OK?

08:39.760 --> 08:41.679

09:15.920 --> 09:17.319
We'd better tell him.

09:18.520 --> 09:22.400
Sir. We, um, lost your mule.

Stubborn Stephanos?

09:24.199 --> 09:25.920
Why he's right here!

09:26.040 --> 09:27.400
He'll only go a short way

09:27.520 --> 09:28.400
before he stops

09:28.520 --> 09:30.640
and turns back home.

09:30.839 --> 09:32.319
I tried to tell you,

09:32.439 --> 09:33.600
but you ran off.

[clock chimes]

09:36.680 --> 09:37.480

09:37.600 --> 09:39.959
Oh, no! It's three o'clock.

09:40.079 --> 09:42.280
PawPaw is going to be so upset.

09:42.400 --> 09:45.680
We haven't delivered
the box to Mr. Papadopoulos!

09:45.800 --> 09:48.600
Yes? You called for me?

09:48.800 --> 09:50.360
Mr. Papadopoulos?

09:50.560 --> 09:53.040
Wait. You're Mr. Papadopoulos?

09:53.240 --> 09:55.520
If only we'd stopped to ask!

09:55.640 --> 09:58.600
Sir, this delivery is for you,
from my grandpa.

09:58.720 --> 10:01.160
Oh, how wonderful!

10:01.280 --> 10:03.319
And it's early, too!

10:03.439 --> 10:04.880
Why, thank you!

10:05.880 --> 10:08.240
I just hope there's time
to get your cookies, Moon.

10:08.360 --> 10:09.680
From the bakery?

10:09.800 --> 10:11.959
Oh, they close soon!

10:12.079 --> 10:12.920
Here,

10:13.040 --> 10:15.040
you better take Speedy Sophia.

10:15.160 --> 10:17.640
That's Stephanos's twin sister.

10:18.199 --> 10:19.839
She'll get you there!

10:20.680 --> 10:22.120
Wait for me!

10:22.240 --> 10:23.520
Don't close now!

10:25.600 --> 10:27.520
Better get ready
for those crumbly cookies.

10:27.640 --> 10:29.319
This could get messy!

10:29.439 --> 10:31.360
There weren't any cookies left.

10:31.560 --> 10:34.040
I'm really, really sorry, Moon.

10:34.160 --> 10:35.520
But, thanks to you,

10:35.640 --> 10:39.319
I remembered to take the time
to ask for the recipe!

10:41.520 --> 10:45.400
Ta-dah! Nothing beats
satisfying a craving!

10:45.959 --> 10:46.959
Mmm-hmm.

10:47.079 --> 10:49.199
Mmm! Delicious!

10:49.319 --> 10:52.360
They taste even better
than the ones I brought back!

10:52.480 --> 10:53.680
They're sweeter!

10:53.800 --> 10:55.120
And more almondy!

10:55.240 --> 10:57.360
And even more crumbly!

10:58.360 --> 10:59.360
