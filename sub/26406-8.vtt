WEBVTT

00:04.395 --> 00:04.613
.

00:04.656 --> 00:07.137
- "Cloud 9 Management
Summit 2018."

00:07.181 --> 00:10.445
- Yeah, managers,
district managers,

00:10.488 --> 00:12.882
assistant managers,
regional managers--

00:12.925 --> 00:16.407
- A lot of managers.
- A ton of managers, big fella.

00:16.451 --> 00:17.843
Anyway, Dina I can't go
this year,

00:17.887 --> 00:20.629
'cause, you know,
her goldfinch is in hospice,

00:20.672 --> 00:23.197
poor thing.
And my in-laws are in town,

00:23.240 --> 00:25.416
which is...unpleasant.

00:25.460 --> 00:28.158
But anyway, two tickets
up for grabs.

00:28.202 --> 00:29.942
- Oh, that's so kind of you
to offer,

00:29.986 --> 00:31.509
but I think I'm gonna pass.

00:31.553 --> 00:35.209
- Yeah, and I-I would go,
but it sounds terrible.

00:35.252 --> 00:37.124
- Oh, okay.

00:37.167 --> 00:39.082
Well, I'm sure you don't
wanna leave

00:39.126 --> 00:41.041
your baby overnight anyway,
right?

00:42.129 --> 00:43.695
- Oh, yeah, it's in Chicago.

00:43.739 --> 00:45.654
The put you up in a hotel,
which I hate,

00:45.697 --> 00:47.525
'cause they're always washing
the sheets.

00:47.569 --> 00:49.353
You never get a chance to have
that nice, lived-in feel.

00:49.397 --> 00:50.789
- Yeah, we're gonna take
these tickets.

00:50.833 --> 00:52.617
Thank you.
- Oh, great.

00:52.661 --> 00:54.532
And it works out perfect
because, you know,

00:54.576 --> 00:56.230
you two are a hot item now,

00:56.273 --> 00:59.233
and they only give you
one hotel room per store.

00:59.276 --> 01:01.713
- So, you and Dina would have
had to share a room?

01:01.757 --> 01:03.063
- Yeah, yeah.

01:03.106 --> 01:04.281
We managed to make it work
last year.

01:04.325 --> 01:05.630
I just read a book
in the bathtub

01:05.674 --> 01:08.807
while she made love
to the bellhop.

01:12.855 --> 01:14.726
â™ª

01:16.076 --> 01:18.078
- I can't wait to get
in to our room

01:18.121 --> 01:19.557
and take a long, hot bath.

01:19.601 --> 01:21.603
- Yeah, mm-hmm.
Maybe I'll join you.

01:21.646 --> 01:23.083
- Ooh, maybe.

01:23.126 --> 01:25.128
Although, I really would rather
just take it by myself,

01:25.172 --> 01:26.173
if that's okay...

01:26.216 --> 01:27.565
- Oh, yeah--no.

01:27.609 --> 01:29.393
I already took a shower
this morning anyway.

01:29.437 --> 01:31.613
- I don't see Amy Sosa
or Jonah Simms on the list.

01:31.656 --> 01:33.397
- Oh, check under
Glenn Sturgis.

01:33.441 --> 01:34.877
He gave us his tickets.

01:34.920 --> 01:37.097
- I'm sorry, the tickets
are non-transferable.

01:39.969 --> 01:41.666
- Right here on the ticket.

01:41.710 --> 01:42.841
- Oh, look at that.

01:42.885 --> 01:45.061
Not even in fine print,
just right there

01:45.105 --> 01:46.889
in big, bold letters.

01:46.932 --> 01:49.196
Hey, guys.

01:49.239 --> 01:53.591
Corporate is asking us to run
everybody through E-Verify,

01:53.635 --> 01:56.246
and there's a bit of a problem.

01:58.161 --> 02:00.120
- It's a registry
for sex offenders.

02:00.163 --> 02:01.947
- No, it's for
undocumented immigrants.

02:03.514 --> 02:05.037
- Because it's not illegal
to hire a sex offender,

02:05.081 --> 02:07.301
but it is illegal to hire
an undocumented immigrant.

02:07.344 --> 02:10.130
- Well, I've heard that
E-Verify is full of bugs.

02:10.173 --> 02:11.957
Just lots and lots of bugs.

02:12.001 --> 02:14.786
- They're not bugs, Cheyenne.
They're human beings.

02:14.830 --> 02:17.615
But we do need to talk.

02:17.659 --> 02:19.400
Or Sayid?

02:19.443 --> 02:20.705
You probably meant Sayid.

02:20.749 --> 02:22.359
Sayid, Glenn
wants to talk to you.

02:22.403 --> 02:23.795
- Yeah, I meant Sayid.

02:23.839 --> 02:25.536
- Good.

02:25.580 --> 02:27.582
That's what I said.
Yeah.

02:27.625 --> 02:29.192
We're all saying
the same thing.

02:29.236 --> 02:31.803
Sayid, I think
you're getting deported.

02:31.847 --> 02:33.283
- But I'm not undocumented.

02:33.327 --> 02:34.719
- Of course you're not.

02:34.763 --> 02:36.112
- He's a refugee.
You have to enter his info

02:36.156 --> 02:37.244
on a different page.

02:37.287 --> 02:40.160
Oh, I had no idea.

02:40.203 --> 02:42.118
- So, what crime
did you commit?

02:42.162 --> 02:43.902
- I committed no crime.

02:45.208 --> 02:47.471
- I'm a refugee,
not a fugitive.

02:47.515 --> 02:49.908
I was fleeing the civil war
in Syria.

02:51.649 --> 02:54.696
- Not good.
Seriously, not good.

02:54.739 --> 02:57.177
- Yeah, there's all sorts of,
like, rampant destruction

02:57.220 --> 02:59.962
and beheadings and locusts,
right?

03:00.005 --> 03:02.225
- Yes, though the locusts
had nothing to do with the war.

03:02.269 --> 03:03.835
They're a seasonal nuisance.

03:03.879 --> 03:05.750
- Hey, what are your thoughts
on the movie, "Syriana"?

03:05.794 --> 03:08.362
- I thought George Clooney
was pretty okay,

03:08.405 --> 03:10.842
and Matt Damon was just okay.

03:12.279 --> 03:14.498
- Cheyenne, why would you
ask that?

03:14.542 --> 03:16.631
- He said he was part
of a civil war.

03:16.674 --> 03:18.676
Our Civil War
was about slavery.

03:18.720 --> 03:21.157
- Actually, the Civil War
was not about slavery.

03:21.201 --> 03:23.768
That's a misconception.
- No, not a misconception.

03:23.812 --> 03:25.335
- Good people can disagree.
- Wrong.

03:25.379 --> 03:27.685
You are not a good person
if you disagree.

03:27.729 --> 03:30.862
- The point is, Sayid,
you're home now.

03:30.906 --> 03:35.040
And on behalf of everyone
in America, we welcome you.

03:36.738 --> 03:39.219
Come on, clap harder.
He's been through stuff.

03:41.699 --> 03:45.225
- Well, at least you got away
from the baby for a few hours.

03:45.268 --> 03:47.531
I mean, nothing against
your baby--he's great.

03:47.575 --> 03:49.185
- Yeah, no, he's the best.

03:49.229 --> 03:52.449
- Uh-oh,
who let these dogs out?

03:52.493 --> 03:53.929
- Hey, Jeff.
- Jeff.

03:53.972 --> 03:55.147
- Hi, guys.

03:55.191 --> 03:56.236
Are you here for
the conference?

03:56.279 --> 03:57.324
That's awesome.

03:57.367 --> 03:58.542
- Well, we were supposed to be,

03:58.586 --> 04:00.588
but apparently
it's just for managers.

04:01.719 --> 04:05.070
- Um...let me take care
of that for ya.

04:06.420 --> 04:08.900
Hey, Denise, these
are friends of mine,

04:08.944 --> 04:10.598
so I can vouch for them.

04:10.641 --> 04:12.252
- I don't know who you are.

04:12.295 --> 04:13.427
What?

04:13.470 --> 04:15.472
We've met, like,
a million times.

04:15.516 --> 04:17.561
- Okay, I'm just gonna say
what everyone's thinking.

04:17.605 --> 04:20.869
How do we know he's not,
you know, ISIS?

04:22.044 --> 04:24.568
- Are you--you haven't
heard of ISIS?

04:24.612 --> 04:26.875
Are you even on Instagram?

04:26.918 --> 04:29.399
- Relax, they vet these guys
for years.

04:29.443 --> 04:31.096
I mean, truthfully,
out of everyone in this store,

04:31.140 --> 04:33.925
Sayid is the one person
I'm sure isn't a terrorist.

04:33.969 --> 04:35.623
- You think I could be
a terrorist?

04:35.666 --> 04:37.277
- Yeah, I definitely think
you could be a terrorist.

04:37.320 --> 04:38.408
- Definitely.
- Oh, yeah.

04:38.452 --> 04:40.236
I would not rent you a U-Haul,
ever.

04:41.498 --> 04:42.673
- I told him to shovel
out front.

04:43.631 --> 04:45.285
Hasn't he been through enough?

04:45.328 --> 04:48.505
I mean, the last thing he needs
is to be thrown out in the cold

04:48.549 --> 04:50.551
like--like he's some nothing.

04:50.594 --> 04:52.770
Mateo, go take over for Sayid.

04:52.814 --> 04:54.206
Wha--

04:54.250 --> 04:55.947
You know what?
I can't.

04:55.991 --> 04:58.036
I am on holiday wrapping duty.
- No problem.

04:58.080 --> 04:59.908
Garrett, could you take over
for Mateo, please?

04:59.951 --> 05:01.388
- Or we can just cut out
the middle man

05:01.431 --> 05:02.693
and have Garrett shovel
the snow.

05:02.737 --> 05:04.347
How am I supposed to do that?

05:04.391 --> 05:06.349
- I mean, we have snow tires.

05:06.393 --> 05:08.395
Okay, I want everybody
to remember this

05:08.438 --> 05:09.831
the next time somebody says

05:09.874 --> 05:11.876
"Garrett can do anything."
- Wow.

05:11.920 --> 05:15.967
- Okay, here are your lanyards
and your room keys.

05:16.011 --> 05:18.143
Sometimes you just gotta
grease the right palms.

05:18.187 --> 05:20.537
'Cause it sort of
looked like you just waited

05:20.581 --> 05:23.192
till her back was turned
and stole these off the table.

05:23.235 --> 05:24.889
- Eagle eyes over here.

05:24.933 --> 05:26.195
- Okay.

05:26.238 --> 05:27.979
And what happens when
the real "Colt McCann"

05:28.023 --> 05:30.373
and "Chien Mon Koh"
try to get in?

05:30.417 --> 05:32.419
You guys want 'em or not?

05:32.462 --> 05:33.768
- Okay.

05:33.811 --> 05:34.899
- Yes, yes, yes!

05:34.943 --> 05:36.466
We're gonna have
a great time together.

05:36.510 --> 05:37.989
Come on, come on, come on--
- No, no, no.

05:38.033 --> 05:39.382
I think we're just gonna
meet you in there later on.

05:39.426 --> 05:40.992
- Yeah, we were
just gonna check in,

05:41.036 --> 05:43.343
settle into the room.
It was a really long drive.

05:43.386 --> 05:44.648
- No, no, no, no.

05:44.692 --> 05:45.780
There's plenty of time
for that later.

05:45.823 --> 05:47.521
Time to get our party on.

05:47.564 --> 05:49.871
Whoop-whoop.
Let's do it.

05:51.394 --> 05:53.788
Wait...

05:53.831 --> 05:56.094
And go.
Go, go, go, go.

05:59.054 --> 05:59.228
.

05:59.271 --> 06:00.664
- It's so unfair.

06:00.708 --> 06:01.970
I'm stuck outside
shoveling snow

06:02.013 --> 06:03.363
while Sayid gets treated
like he's

06:03.406 --> 06:06.061
part of Janet Jackson's
entourage, or something.

06:06.104 --> 06:07.584
- I know, he's safe
and sound now.

06:07.628 --> 06:10.631
If anyone deserves
special treatment, it's you.

06:10.674 --> 06:12.328
Thank you.

06:12.372 --> 06:15.418
- I mean, you could be deported
literally at any moment,

06:15.462 --> 06:17.681
just taken back to
the Philippines

06:17.725 --> 06:19.727
on some sex trafficker's
yacht.

06:21.206 --> 06:23.818
I'm undocumented,
not Liam Neeson's daughter.

06:25.646 --> 06:27.517
- Hey, Sayid.

06:28.605 --> 06:29.606
Whatcha doing?

06:29.650 --> 06:31.782
- I left my lunch in the car.

06:31.826 --> 06:33.001
- Cool.

06:33.044 --> 06:34.959
Well, looks yummy
for your tummy.

06:36.961 --> 06:39.007
Apple a day.
Ha ha.

06:40.530 --> 06:43.098
You literally called yourself
"undocumented."

06:43.141 --> 06:44.621
Yeah, I know.
- 'Cause if he did,

06:44.665 --> 06:47.494
then he might tell Dina
or Glenn or corporate--

06:47.537 --> 06:49.365
- Yeah, there's a lot of people
he could tell.

06:49.409 --> 06:52.020
- Welcome to the big time,
huh?

06:52.063 --> 06:53.195
You like shrimp cocktail?

06:53.238 --> 06:54.370
Well, prepare to be happy,

06:54.414 --> 06:56.198
because there's
shrimp cocktail.

06:56.241 --> 06:58.592
- Wow, this is not at all
what I expected.

06:58.635 --> 07:00.376
- Well, you know,
they call it a conference,

07:00.420 --> 07:02.334
but it's really just
a ball's-out party.

07:02.378 --> 07:04.554
I mean, one of us
is gonna end up puking

07:04.598 --> 07:05.947
before the night is over.

07:05.990 --> 07:07.514
Probably me.
- Hmm.

07:07.557 --> 07:10.255
- Well, thanks so much
for showing us around, Jeff.

07:10.299 --> 07:11.779
I'm sure you gotta go mingle.

07:11.822 --> 07:13.650
- Yes, good idea, I don't want
anybody to feel excluded.

07:13.694 --> 07:15.522
I'm gonna take a quick lap,
say a few hellos,

07:15.565 --> 07:17.262
and I'll see you guys
by the ice sculpture.

07:17.306 --> 07:18.873
- Oh, no--you--we don't
really have to...

07:22.267 --> 07:24.400
- Don't look at me like that.
I did all the heavy lifting.

07:24.444 --> 07:25.967
You can finish it up at home.
Happy holidays.

07:26.010 --> 07:27.447
Next.

07:28.186 --> 07:29.884
- That is your idea
of gift wrapping?

07:29.927 --> 07:31.320
- I don't believe in
gift wrapping.

07:31.363 --> 07:32.930
If I go through the trouble
of getting you a gift,

07:32.974 --> 07:34.236
that should be enough.

07:34.279 --> 07:36.281
Now you want me to waste time,
waste paper,

07:36.325 --> 07:38.240
just so you can rip it shreds
and be just as surprised

07:38.283 --> 07:40.068
as if I just handed you
the gift unwrapped?

07:40.111 --> 07:41.417
I don't think so.

07:41.461 --> 07:42.679
- You don't know how
to wrap a gift.

07:42.723 --> 07:44.420
- I do not.

07:48.468 --> 07:51.079
That sounds rough.
You see any action?

07:52.123 --> 07:54.343
- Yeah, like drone strikes,

07:54.386 --> 07:57.433
IUDS, big, loud explosions?

07:57.477 --> 07:59.522
That must have killed
your hearing.

07:59.566 --> 08:00.654
- My hearing's good.

08:00.697 --> 08:01.829
- Hmm.

08:03.091 --> 08:04.440
Can you hear this?

08:04.484 --> 08:05.702
- Yes.

08:07.095 --> 08:08.923
How about this?

08:08.966 --> 08:10.533
- Yes.
- Oh, cool.

08:10.577 --> 08:13.405
Well, I'm glad everything's
intact.

08:17.540 --> 08:20.151
- I just wanted to lie in bed,
order room service,

08:20.195 --> 08:21.501
and watch pay-per-view.

08:21.544 --> 08:23.415
- We still will.
We'll sneak out of here

08:23.459 --> 08:25.287
as soon as Jeff
moves away from the doors.

08:25.330 --> 08:26.984
- He's been standing there
for like, 20 minutes.

08:27.028 --> 08:29.160
He's just parked there waiting
for someone to talk to him.

08:29.204 --> 08:30.510
It's so sad.

08:30.553 --> 08:31.772
- You'd think someone
would let the poor guy

08:31.815 --> 08:33.382
in on a conversation.

08:33.425 --> 08:35.427
- Yeah, well, everyone here's
a d-bag anyway, so...

08:35.471 --> 08:37.865
- Not everyone.
- Everyone here is a d-bag.

08:37.908 --> 08:39.867
- This is a room full
of d-bags.

08:39.910 --> 08:41.303
- Come on.
- He's a d-bag.

08:41.346 --> 08:44.306
He's a d-bag.
She's a triple d-bag.

08:44.349 --> 08:46.482
These are the kind of people
who come here every year,

08:46.526 --> 08:48.832
they eat 1/2 million dollars'
worth of shrimp cocktail,

08:48.876 --> 08:51.574
and then they tell us that they
can't afford maternity leave.

08:51.618 --> 08:54.142
- These are just ordinary,
boring people.

08:54.185 --> 08:55.622
- D-bags.
- Watch--watch.

08:55.665 --> 08:57.101
- What are you--
- Howdy.

08:57.145 --> 08:58.973
I'm Colt McCann.

08:59.016 --> 09:02.019
Down here abouts from, uh...

09:02.063 --> 09:04.587
Burlington, Vermont.
That's weird.

09:04.631 --> 09:06.328
- Ted Morrison.
- Hey, Ted.

09:06.371 --> 09:08.156
- Kent Ostrofsky.
- Hey, Kent.

09:08.199 --> 09:10.462
- Chien Mon Koh.
Family name.

09:10.506 --> 09:12.116
- Ah!
- So, Chien and I

09:12.160 --> 09:15.032
were just talking about
a $15 minimum wage.

09:15.076 --> 09:16.425
How y'all feel about that?

09:16.468 --> 09:18.166
- Ask me, the floor workers

09:18.209 --> 09:19.994
are barely worth
15 bucks a week.

09:20.037 --> 09:21.343
- Don't even get me started.

09:21.386 --> 09:23.040
"Pay us more.
Give us more hours.

09:23.084 --> 09:25.173
I'm on food stamps."
It's endless.

09:27.349 --> 09:28.655
both: Ugh. Yeah.
- They really should let us

09:28.698 --> 09:31.179
kill one of those entitled
brats each year.

09:31.222 --> 09:32.702
You know,
just to keep us sane.

09:32.746 --> 09:34.530
- That's exactly what
they should do.

09:34.574 --> 09:37.315
- That's a good idea.
- Ugh, I hate them so much.

09:37.359 --> 09:39.230
- These are funny jokes.

09:40.188 --> 09:42.190
- We need to fortify
these two weak spots with tape.

09:42.233 --> 09:43.844
- The whole thing is tape
at this point.

09:43.887 --> 09:46.455
- Just do it, it's not like
society's in a tape shortage.

09:46.498 --> 09:48.283
Oh, this is a good, long
piece, yeah.

09:48.326 --> 09:50.764
Oh, no you've taped my hand
to the gift.

09:57.988 --> 10:00.643
- Why does everyone here
start conversations like that?

10:00.687 --> 10:02.340
- Ha.

10:02.384 --> 10:04.647
You know, I'm actually
an immigrant, too.

10:04.691 --> 10:07.084
Not a refugee, like you.
Knock on wood.

10:08.695 --> 10:10.871
Just a regular,
undocumented immigrant.

10:10.914 --> 10:12.481
Or is it "documented"?

10:12.524 --> 10:14.222
I'm always mixing those up.

10:14.265 --> 10:16.441
I think it's like
inflammable-flammable,

10:16.485 --> 10:18.139
where they mean the same thing?

10:18.182 --> 10:19.488
- No, they're opposites.

10:19.531 --> 10:22.534
- Anyway, I'm definitely
the legal kind.

10:22.578 --> 10:25.320
Came here legally,
took the citizenship test,

10:25.363 --> 10:27.365
got sworn in by the president.

10:29.324 --> 10:31.631
- Uh-huh, yeah.

10:31.674 --> 10:32.588
Yeah.

10:32.632 --> 10:34.851
They, um, they do it
personally.

10:34.895 --> 10:36.070
At least they used to.

10:37.724 --> 10:40.814
- God, it's been so long,

10:40.857 --> 10:42.729
I don't even remember.

10:42.772 --> 10:44.992
One of the white ones?

10:45.035 --> 10:47.690
I wanna say...Henderson.

10:47.734 --> 10:49.605
Yes.

10:50.954 --> 10:53.087
- He's pretending to see people
he knows across the room,

10:53.130 --> 10:54.349
but there's no one there.

10:54.392 --> 10:56.873
- Hey, buddy.
There he is.

10:56.917 --> 10:58.570
I didn't know you were here.
- Now's our chance.

10:58.614 --> 11:00.311
Go, go, go, go, go, go.
- Okay, okay, okay!

11:05.316 --> 11:07.101
- No, they're free.

11:07.144 --> 11:10.539
- You're just--you're just
offering to give me an iPad?

11:10.582 --> 11:13.107
- Well, not just you.
All the managers.

11:13.150 --> 11:15.022
- Well, I am a manager.

11:15.065 --> 11:16.937
I am Chien Mon Koh.

11:16.980 --> 11:18.721
- That's fine, take one.

11:18.765 --> 11:22.203
- Okay, then,
I will take this iPad.

11:22.246 --> 11:23.247
- Go right ahead.

11:23.291 --> 11:24.988
- I'm gonna go now.

11:25.032 --> 11:26.424
- Okay.

11:28.252 --> 11:29.601
Oh, my God,
I can't believe

11:29.645 --> 11:31.125
they're just giving out iPads.

11:31.168 --> 11:32.779
- Yeah, you played that
very cool, by the way.

11:32.822 --> 11:35.477
- Wait a second.
Is everybody in a green polo

11:35.520 --> 11:38.393
just giving away free stuff?
- I guess.

11:38.436 --> 11:39.960
You know what they're also
giving out for free?

11:40.003 --> 11:42.049
Nice hotel rooms with
bathrobes and room service.

11:42.092 --> 11:43.485
- Yes, yes.
We should go.

11:43.528 --> 11:44.921
- Great.
- I'm just gonna go get

11:44.965 --> 11:46.401
one of those fancy wine openers
real quick.

11:46.444 --> 11:48.620
- Amy--
Chien!

11:50.144 --> 11:50.361
.

11:50.405 --> 11:53.016
- Oh, yes.
This is perfect for Aspen.

11:53.060 --> 11:54.757
I go once a year.
It's just gotten

11:54.801 --> 11:56.759
really overrun
by tourists recently.

11:58.456 --> 12:01.851
- Just trying on these
$300 coats they're giving away.

12:01.895 --> 12:03.374
- Ah.
- He'll take one too.

12:03.418 --> 12:05.289
- That's okay, I don't need
a woman's coat.

12:05.333 --> 12:06.421
- Well, you can take one

12:06.464 --> 12:08.292
for your 15-year-old
daughter, Emma.

12:08.336 --> 12:10.120
- I'll take one coat,
please.

12:10.164 --> 12:11.861
By the way,
speaking of free things,

12:11.905 --> 12:13.123
it's an open bar.

12:13.167 --> 12:15.560
- Oh.
Thank you.

12:15.604 --> 12:17.388
- Uno.
- Dos.

12:17.432 --> 12:18.781
- Tres.
- Cuatro.

12:18.825 --> 12:20.522
- L'chaim.

12:20.565 --> 12:21.828
Oh.
- Ugh.

12:23.351 --> 12:24.700
Two more, please.

12:24.744 --> 12:25.788
Howdy, partner.

12:27.398 --> 12:28.704
- â™ª Walk away

12:28.748 --> 12:29.705
- Switch.

12:29.749 --> 12:30.750
Wait, wait, wait.

12:30.793 --> 12:33.970
- Oh, thank you.
Nice.

12:34.014 --> 12:35.406
â™ª

12:35.450 --> 12:38.845
- Mmm. Wow, that is
what I would imagine

12:38.888 --> 12:40.150
a cloud would taste like.

12:41.412 --> 12:43.110
Switch.
- Oh.

12:43.850 --> 12:46.156
- Oh, that's a cloud!

12:46.200 --> 12:48.376
- â™ª I'll be here downtown
and I see your face â™ª

12:48.419 --> 12:50.508
â™ª Thought I caught
that smile today â™ª

12:52.684 --> 12:53.685
- That's terrifying.

12:53.729 --> 12:54.991
- Here.

12:55.731 --> 12:56.906
Whoo.
- Whoop.

12:56.950 --> 12:58.778
- And boom.

12:58.821 --> 13:00.388
- So, I think you just step...

13:00.431 --> 13:01.432
Oh, that looks nice.

13:01.476 --> 13:03.043
- Oh, yes, thank you.

13:03.086 --> 13:04.348
You put the mushroom

13:04.392 --> 13:06.437
on the mini grilled cheese
sandwich,

13:06.481 --> 13:08.744
and then they all go in
at the same time.

13:08.788 --> 13:11.181
Oh, that definitely looks like
an orgy's going on in there.

13:12.443 --> 13:13.923
Who holds the bag?
- Oh, I'll hold the bag.

13:13.967 --> 13:15.925
You've got the vest.
- Oh, that's great.

13:17.405 --> 13:20.930
- Whoa, it's like we're really
in a grocery store.

13:20.974 --> 13:22.802
- I feel like technology
is solving problems

13:22.845 --> 13:24.107
we don't even have.

13:24.151 --> 13:25.413
- "Best friends" on three.

13:25.456 --> 13:28.155
One...two...best friends.

13:28.938 --> 13:30.853
- Okay, so, after the twirl,

13:30.897 --> 13:32.942
you just pull
the ribbon through

13:32.986 --> 13:35.640
and...voila.

13:35.684 --> 13:37.294
Easy-peasy.
- Okay, I guess.

13:37.338 --> 13:38.905
- Yeah, I mean,
if you're going for something

13:38.948 --> 13:40.471
that's kind of generic-looking.

13:40.515 --> 13:41.864
- Cheyenne, I can't believe

13:41.908 --> 13:43.561
you didn't tell me
you were pregnant.

13:44.867 --> 13:47.043
- Obviously she is.
Look at her boobs.

13:47.087 --> 13:49.350
- Whoa!
- I'm not pregnant.

13:49.393 --> 13:51.134
- But Sayid said...

13:51.178 --> 13:54.834
That guy's always
making up stuff about people.

13:56.009 --> 13:57.184
- I mean, it's--it's not
his fault.

13:57.227 --> 13:59.229
Uh, it's a cultural thing.

13:59.273 --> 14:01.928
You know, lying is a big part
of Syrian culture.

14:01.971 --> 14:03.364
- I've never heard that,
and I've slept with

14:03.407 --> 14:04.495
a ton of Syrian dudes.

14:04.539 --> 14:06.062
- Wait, is that where
the phrase,

14:06.106 --> 14:08.848
"lying like a Syrian"
comes from, Mateo?

14:08.891 --> 14:10.980
- Oh, you know,
now that you mention it,

14:11.024 --> 14:13.026
that makes sense.
Yes, Cheyenne.

14:13.069 --> 14:15.419
- Wow, what a completely
natural conversation,

14:15.463 --> 14:16.725
Cheyenne and Mateo.

14:16.768 --> 14:19.249
- Sayid never mentioned
anything about lying

14:19.293 --> 14:20.947
when I interviewed him.

14:20.990 --> 14:23.036
Then again, if he was a liar,
he wouldn't have.

14:23.079 --> 14:24.994
- Mmm.
- But if he wasn't a liar,

14:25.038 --> 14:27.518
he wouldn't have either,
so--oh, this is a pickle.

14:27.562 --> 14:30.173
- Hold on, so when Sayid said
he liked my haircut...

14:30.217 --> 14:32.436
- Yep, lying like a Syrian.

14:32.480 --> 14:35.135
- Damn it.
Do you guys like my hair?

14:35.178 --> 14:36.701
- Eh.
- Eh.

14:36.745 --> 14:38.312
- Phew.
Thanks, I was worried.

14:38.355 --> 14:41.097
I said, "Make me look like
Jeff Probst."

14:41.141 --> 14:43.056
- I know it's so bad
for your teeth,

14:43.099 --> 14:44.579
but I love chewing on ice.

14:44.622 --> 14:46.798
- You have so many interests
that I don't know about.

14:46.842 --> 14:48.844
- So cold.

14:48.888 --> 14:50.106
Oh, look, look, look, look.

14:50.150 --> 14:53.022
It's our best friends.
- Ted! Kent!

14:53.066 --> 14:55.372
Get over here you
sons of bitches.

14:55.416 --> 14:57.722
- Oh, damn are we getting
turnt over here?

14:57.766 --> 14:58.854
- Turnt!
- Oh yeah,

14:58.898 --> 15:00.551
we are getting turnt.

15:00.595 --> 15:03.076
- We were just laughing
about the fact that

15:03.119 --> 15:04.947
we get all this free stuff,

15:04.991 --> 15:06.993
and the floor workers
get nothing.

15:08.124 --> 15:09.473
- Yeah, that is pretty funny.

15:09.517 --> 15:10.910
- All right, all right.

15:10.953 --> 15:13.390
Here's a joke:
How many floor workers

15:13.434 --> 15:15.218
does it take to screw in
a lightbulb?

15:15.262 --> 15:16.872
- Shut up! You're fired.

15:19.919 --> 15:21.268
- I don't even get it.

15:21.311 --> 15:24.053
- Me neither, Kent,
me neither.

15:24.097 --> 15:26.534
- â™ª It's the most
wonderful time â™ª

15:26.577 --> 15:30.320
â™ª Of the year
- â™ª Ding-dong-dong-ding

15:32.105 --> 15:33.584
- Not as good as your elves,
huh?

15:35.064 --> 15:36.936
- 'Cause you look like
Santa Claus.

15:36.979 --> 15:39.503
- And you look like a dick.

15:39.547 --> 15:40.940
- Surprising.

15:42.550 --> 15:44.247
- Okay, what's the difference
between a floor worker

15:44.291 --> 15:45.988
and a two
- Here we go.

15:46.032 --> 15:47.729
- Two-legged chair
don't make $8.50 an hour

15:47.772 --> 15:49.252
for being useless.

15:49.296 --> 15:50.950
Shut up! You're fired.

15:50.993 --> 15:53.256
- It's just getting better!
- Hey, Bill, get over here.

15:53.300 --> 15:54.779
This guy's throwing
rocks tonight.

15:54.823 --> 15:56.085
- Oh, I got one, I got one.

15:56.129 --> 15:58.174
How do you get out of
giving benefits

15:58.218 --> 16:00.133
to a full

16:00.176 --> 16:02.222
- Make them two part-time
employees.

16:02.265 --> 16:05.268
- Boom!
Chien is killing it.

16:05.312 --> 16:06.878
- That's actually a good idea,
though.

16:06.922 --> 16:08.576
- Yeah, you just tell
every full-timer

16:08.619 --> 16:10.360
that they're now actually two
part-timers--you save a ton.

16:10.404 --> 16:12.406
- I wasn't actually
suggesting--

16:12.449 --> 16:14.103
- Hey, we should get Tracey
in legal on this.

16:14.147 --> 16:15.887
- Yeah. Hey, Tracey.

16:15.931 --> 16:17.672
- You gotta hear this good idea
that Chien Mon Koh just had.

16:19.021 --> 16:20.283
I think I just see
someone I know.

16:20.327 --> 16:21.763
- Tracey, come here!
- Hassan, hi.

16:21.806 --> 16:23.156
- Hold on, Chien.
- Come on.

16:24.113 --> 16:25.201
- Why are you telling people

16:25.245 --> 16:26.507
that I'm "lying like a Syrian"?

16:26.550 --> 16:28.074
- Um, I don't think
I ever said--

16:28.117 --> 16:29.597
That is not a saying.

16:29.640 --> 16:31.686
Was this Marcus?

16:31.729 --> 16:34.645
'Cause that guy is...

16:34.689 --> 16:36.299
Okay, fine.

16:36.343 --> 16:39.259
I just...I know you heard me

16:39.302 --> 16:41.652
talking about being
undocumented.

16:41.696 --> 16:43.306
- You mean,
President Henderson

16:43.350 --> 16:45.308
didn't personally
swear you in?

16:45.352 --> 16:48.007
- No, I don't even think
Henderson was still alive

16:48.050 --> 16:49.225
when I came here.

16:49.269 --> 16:50.661
I was nervous that
you might turn me in,

16:50.705 --> 16:53.142
so ironically,
I was the one who started

16:53.186 --> 16:54.491
lying like a Syrian.

16:54.535 --> 16:57.146
- Again, that is not
a real saying.

16:57.190 --> 16:58.930
And why would I wanna
turn you in?

16:58.974 --> 17:00.628
It's none of my business.

17:00.671 --> 17:02.934
- I don't know, maybe you were
afraid of getting into trouble.

17:02.978 --> 17:04.197
Like not saying anything

17:04.240 --> 17:05.763
might somehow make you
my accomplice.

17:05.807 --> 17:07.156
- Oh.

17:07.200 --> 17:09.245
- But you're not.

17:09.289 --> 17:12.161
You are just
an innocent bystander.

17:12.205 --> 17:13.641
- Yes, in my experience,

17:13.684 --> 17:16.252
nothing ever happens
to innocent bystanders.

17:16.296 --> 17:20.213
- Look, Sayid, Sayid,
don't worry about it.

17:20.256 --> 17:21.344
What are they gonna do,
deport you

17:21.388 --> 17:22.737
for not ratting me out?

17:22.780 --> 17:24.869
- I can honestly say
that that thought

17:24.913 --> 17:27.089
had not occurred to me.

17:30.310 --> 17:32.007
- To the back.
I have work to do.

17:32.051 --> 17:33.356
- I'll come with.

17:33.400 --> 17:35.184
- I might have to go
to the men's room first.

17:35.228 --> 17:37.186
- We'll both go.

17:39.406 --> 17:39.580
.

17:39.623 --> 17:43.366
- Mateo, Sayid seems to think
that you're undocumented

17:43.410 --> 17:46.108
and that you've been working
in this store illegally.

17:46.152 --> 17:48.763
That--that's crazy.

17:48.806 --> 17:52.941
Why would he...wait,
is today November 29th?

17:52.984 --> 17:54.029
- Yeah.

17:54.073 --> 17:56.640
- It's Syrian April Fool's Day.

17:56.684 --> 18:00.427
That guy--I am gonna
go shaving cream his locker.

18:00.470 --> 18:03.604
- Okay, I didn't believe him
at first, so I checked.

18:03.647 --> 18:05.867
Did you know that
your social security number

18:05.910 --> 18:09.088
belongs to a Polish woman
from Buffalo?

18:09.131 --> 18:12.091
So, unless your name
is Nadia Kedzierski,

18:12.134 --> 18:13.744
we have a problem.

18:13.788 --> 18:16.530
- Oh, this isn't
my social security number.

18:16.573 --> 18:18.749
Must've got put in wrong.

18:18.793 --> 18:20.186
- Oh, okay.

18:20.229 --> 18:21.752
Well, I'm relieved
to hear that.

18:21.796 --> 18:24.581
So, if you could just enter
your real one.

18:25.626 --> 18:27.932
- I don't think
you're supposed to give out--

18:27.976 --> 18:29.760
- Okay, Mateo,
I'm not kidding.

18:38.813 --> 18:42.251
- Okay--well, that's only
five numbers, like a zip code.

18:42.295 --> 18:44.340
Um, you need four more.

18:44.384 --> 18:49.084
- Uh, it's, uh, the last four,
uh, is, um, two...

18:49.128 --> 18:50.346
- Two.
- Nine...

18:50.390 --> 18:52.043
- Nine.
- Nine...

18:52.087 --> 18:55.917
- Nine.
- Nine.

18:55.960 --> 19:00.182
- Okay, I'll just
run this through E-Verify.

19:00.226 --> 19:02.141
Thanks.

19:10.497 --> 19:12.760
- Wow.
- Yeah.

19:12.803 --> 19:14.457
- You know, of all the times
we made love,

19:14.501 --> 19:16.198
we never made anything
this beautiful.

19:17.808 --> 19:18.896
- So, can I...

19:18.940 --> 19:20.289
- You can get another one
in aisle six.

19:20.333 --> 19:21.986
- Yeah, but we're not gonna
wrap it.

19:22.030 --> 19:23.466
We're going out on top.

19:23.510 --> 19:25.251
- Okay, I'll go get another.

19:25.294 --> 19:27.601
- Just get another one.
- Okay.

19:27.644 --> 19:28.776
- Ugh.

19:28.819 --> 19:30.169
Can you believe
these are the idiots

19:30.212 --> 19:31.474
who lead this company?

19:31.518 --> 19:34.216
- Not exactly the best
and brightest.

19:34.260 --> 19:36.827
- And they get paid
ten times as much as us.

19:36.871 --> 19:38.220
And they get better benefits

19:38.264 --> 19:41.484
and free aroma-therapy
diffusers.

19:41.528 --> 19:42.790
They don't even have to
pay for their

19:42.833 --> 19:44.748
aroma-therapy diffusers.
How is that fair?

19:44.792 --> 19:46.576
- Maybe you should be
a manager.

19:49.536 --> 19:51.494
I mean, they have those
training seminars.

19:51.538 --> 19:54.932
They love bragging about
how they promote from within.

19:54.976 --> 19:56.717
And like you said,

19:56.760 --> 19:58.849
these people are not
rocket scientists.

19:58.893 --> 20:01.461
- I'm a single mom,
and I just had a second baby.

20:01.504 --> 20:04.855
It's not exactly the best time
to make a big life change.

20:04.899 --> 20:06.205
- Ah.

20:08.163 --> 20:10.513
When is?

20:12.515 --> 20:13.864
- Do you think
we'll still be friends

20:13.908 --> 20:15.692
when I get sent back
to the Philippines?

20:15.736 --> 20:18.478
- Of course we're still
gonna be friends.

20:18.521 --> 20:21.089
Ooh, maybe I could come
visit you.

20:21.132 --> 20:24.701
I hear they have nice beaches
and really cheap massages.

20:24.745 --> 20:26.355
I bet I could get
a deal on a ticket

20:26.399 --> 20:27.748
if I book it far enough
in advance.

20:27.791 --> 20:29.402
- Cheyenne, I'm about
to be deported,

20:29.445 --> 20:31.012
and you're planning
your vacation.

20:31.055 --> 20:32.579
- Sorry.

20:33.754 --> 20:37.105
But hotels are super
inexpensive, right?

20:37.148 --> 20:38.759
- Oh, my God, so affordable.

20:38.802 --> 20:40.935
- That's what I heard.
- Yeah, it's great.

20:43.981 --> 20:46.288
- Sure.

20:52.338 --> 20:54.601
- So, I ran your
social security number--

20:54.644 --> 20:57.952
- Okay, look, I know it's--
- And it checked out.

21:00.476 --> 21:02.435
- Yep, it did.

21:11.618 --> 21:14.447
- Merry Christmas, Mateo.

21:16.405 --> 21:18.538
- You've been legal
this whole time?

21:18.581 --> 21:21.018
How much attention
do you need?
