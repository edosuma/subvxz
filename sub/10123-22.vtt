WEBVTT

00:00.700 --> 00:02.400
YOU GOT YOUR MILK.

00:02.400 --> 00:06.100
YOU GOT YOUR
PEANUT BUTTER.

00:06.100 --> 00:07.300
HOW ABOUT A BANANA?

00:07.300 --> 00:10.200
WHAT ABOUT
A RAW EGG?

00:10.200 --> 00:11.600
EWW. WHY'S IT
HAVE TO BE RAW?

00:11.600 --> 00:15.033
WHY CAN'T WE SCRAMBLE IT
AND PUT IT IN?

00:15.033 --> 00:17.500
STALLONE DRINKS
RAW EGGS.

00:17.500 --> 00:20.233
STALLONE IS LIKE
5'2"!

00:20.233 --> 00:22.400
AND YOU'RE LIKE
2'5"!

00:22.400 --> 00:26.100
GO WITH THE EGG,
BABY.

00:27.300 --> 00:28.367
HEY...

00:28.367 --> 00:30.233
WE'RE NOT GOING TO
MAKE A MESS.

00:30.233 --> 00:31.500
JUST BECAUSE WE'RE KIDS
WITH A BLENDER

00:31.500 --> 00:34.500
DOESN'T MEAN WE HAVE
TO MAKE A MESS.

00:34.500 --> 00:37.900
BOY, ARE YOU
MOMMY WHIPPED.

00:37.900 --> 00:40.800
AAH!

00:42.200 --> 00:46.200
NOW, THAT I COULD
NEVER DO AT MY HOUSE.

00:46.200 --> 00:48.567
OH, MY MOM!
SHAWN, BACK ME UP.

00:48.567 --> 00:53.200
I WANTED TO USE THE LID.
I WAS LID BOY!

00:56.567 --> 00:58.567
OK, FINE.
I'LL CLEAN IT UP.

00:58.567 --> 01:02.200
YOU DON'T
HAVE TO SCREAM.

01:02.200 --> 01:03.300
HEY, WATCH IT.

01:03.300 --> 01:05.300
YOU'RE GETTING IT ALL
OVER MY GEOGRAPHY BOOK.

01:05.300 --> 01:07.467
OH, LIKE YOU'RE EVER
GOING TO OPEN IT UP.

01:07.467 --> 01:10.400
FEENY'S TEST TOMORROW IS
GOING TO BE SUCH A KILLER.

01:10.400 --> 01:13.033
YEAH, I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY WE HAVE TO LEARN

01:13.033 --> 01:13.600
ANYTHING ABOUT
GEOGRAPHY.

01:13.600 --> 01:16.300
WHY DO WE HAVE TO LEARN
WHERE EVERYTHING IS?

01:16.300 --> 01:17.400
I'LL JUST BE
LIKE MY DAD

01:17.400 --> 01:20.767
AND DRIVE AROUND
TILL I FIND IT.

01:21.300 --> 01:22.367
LOOK AT FEENY.

01:22.367 --> 01:26.300
HE'S OUT THERE HANGING UP
SOME GEEKY DUCK.

01:26.300 --> 01:27.400
NOT A CARE IN THE WORLD

01:27.400 --> 01:31.467
WHILE WE'RE STUCK IN HERE
STUDYING FOR HIS LAME TEST.

01:31.467 --> 01:33.400
YEAH. LIFE'S FAIR.

01:33.400 --> 01:36.233
WELL, WE HAVEN'T ACTUALLY
DONE ANY STUDYING YET.

01:36.233 --> 01:38.300
MAYBE WE SHOULD GET STARTED.

01:38.300 --> 01:39.300
OK. AHEM.

01:39.300 --> 01:43.100
WHAT IS THE CAPITAL
OF NORTH DAKOTA?

01:43.100 --> 01:44.934
BANFF.

01:46.100 --> 01:46.834
WE'RE TOAST.

01:46.834 --> 01:49.600
LET'S JUST SAY WE'RE SICK
AND STAY HOME TOMORROW.

01:49.600 --> 01:51.367
I CAN'T, COR.
I'VE ALREADY USED

01:51.367 --> 01:53.233
ALL MY BOGUS
MEDICAL EXCUSES.

01:53.233 --> 01:56.033
FEENY SAYS IF MY GRANDMA
DIES ONE MORE TIME,

01:56.033 --> 01:58.400
HE WANTS TO SEE
THE BODY.

01:58.400 --> 02:00.100
HOW COME
IT HAS TO BE US?

02:00.100 --> 02:01.300
WHY SHOULD WE
ALWAYS BE THE ONES

02:01.300 --> 02:04.100
FAKING A DISEASE TO
GET OUT OF SCHOOL?

02:04.100 --> 02:05.300
HOW COME FEENY
CAN'T SHOULDER

02:05.300 --> 02:07.300
A LITTLE MORE
RESPONSIBILITY?

02:07.300 --> 02:09.100
AH, DREAM ON.
I HEAR HE HASN'T MISSED

02:09.100 --> 02:12.200
A DAY OF SCHOOL
SINCE WORLD WAR I.

02:12.200 --> 02:13.300
THAT'S JUST STUPID
ON HIS PART,

02:13.300 --> 02:16.133
BECAUSE TEACHERS STILL GET
PAID WHEN THEY'RE SICK.

02:16.133 --> 02:17.133
YOU LIE.

02:17.133 --> 02:19.300
I SWEAR! MINKUS SAID
THE SCHOOL BOARD

02:19.300 --> 02:22.500
PAYS THEM TO BE SICK FOR
A WHOLE WEEK EVERY YEAR.

02:22.500 --> 02:24.500
WELL, MAYBE FEENY
DOESN'T KNOW THAT.

02:24.500 --> 02:28.500
MAYBE WE SHOULD LEAVE HIM, LIKE,
A UNANIMOUS NOTE ON HIS DESK.

02:28.500 --> 02:34.000
WON'T HELP US DODGE THAT
GEOGRAPHY BULLET TOMORROW.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.367
COME ON...COUGH!

02:36.367 --> 02:38.300

02:38.300 --> 02:41.767

02:46.033 --> 02:48.100
THERE'S A LOOK.

02:48.100 --> 02:48.700
DON'T TELL ME.

02:48.700 --> 02:53.100
YOU'VE DIED AND COME BACK
AS A BAT WITH A PERM.

02:53.100 --> 02:54.200
THIS HINDU YOGA POSITION

02:54.200 --> 02:56.200
INCREASES BLOOD FLOW
TO THE BRAIN,

02:56.200 --> 02:57.367
THUS MAXIMIZING
CONCENTRATION

02:57.367 --> 02:59.500
AND COGNITIVE
PERFORMANCE.

02:59.500 --> 03:03.100
IT'S ALSO QUITE A RUSH.

03:03.100 --> 03:04.133
I AM SO NERVOUS.

03:04.133 --> 03:06.200
YOU? MY PALMS
ARE SWEATING SO MUCH,

03:06.200 --> 03:08.400
I CAN'T READ THE ANSWERS
I WROTE ON THEM.

03:08.400 --> 03:13.000
I'M SENSING AN ACUTE CASE
OF PERFORMANCE ANXIETY,

03:13.000 --> 03:13.567
NO DOUBT BROUGHT ON

03:13.567 --> 03:15.300
BY A COMPLETE LACK
OF PREPARATION.

03:15.300 --> 03:18.233
MINKUS, YOU CAN GET
ALL THE As YOU WANT.

03:18.233 --> 03:20.300
IT STILL NOT GONNA
MAKE YOU POPULAR.

03:20.300 --> 03:21.300
THAT'S RIGHT.

03:21.300 --> 03:22.400
I CAN JUST HEAR YOU
10 YEARS FROM NOW.

03:22.400 --> 03:26.100
"PEOPLE, PEOPLE, HOW MANY TIMES
DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU?

03:26.100 --> 03:27.300
"IF YOU SAVE
YOUR RECEIPTS,

03:27.300 --> 03:30.300
YOU WON'T HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT AN AUDIT."

03:30.300 --> 03:34.000
AND I CAN HEAR YOU
10 YEARS FROM NOW--

03:34.000 --> 03:36.400
"YOUR HONOR, DUDE...

03:36.400 --> 03:39.900
I'D LIKE TO
PLEA BARGAIN."

03:42.000 --> 03:43.300

03:43.300 --> 03:45.200

03:45.200 --> 03:46.600
GOOD MORNING, CLASS.

03:46.600 --> 03:49.600
I'M MISS CHASE,
YOUR SUBSTITUTE TEACHER.

03:49.600 --> 03:52.300
MR. FEENY
WILL NOT BE IN TODAY.

03:52.300 --> 03:53.567
HE HAS TAKEN ILL.

03:53.567 --> 03:56.300
TAKEN ILL
OR FAKIN' ILL?

03:56.300 --> 03:57.600
I MEAN, THE GUY'S
NEVER MISSED A DAY.

03:57.600 --> 04:00.200
MAYBE HE HEARD ABOUT
THE SCHOOL BOARD'S

04:00.200 --> 04:02.567
GREAT DEAL
ON SICK LEAVE.

04:02.567 --> 04:04.500
I'M AFRAID
I DON'T HAVE ACCESS

04:04.500 --> 04:06.367
TO MR. FEENY'S
LESSON PLAN.

04:06.367 --> 04:07.367
CAN SOMEBODY PLEASE
FILL ME IN

04:07.367 --> 04:08.500
ON WHAT YOU WERE
GOING TO DO TODAY?

04:08.500 --> 04:11.400
OH, MISS CHASE, TODAY
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO TAKE A GEO--

04:11.400 --> 04:14.500
BREAK. A BREAK
FROM GEOGRAPHY.

04:14.500 --> 04:17.200
AND DO NOTHING BUT
THINK ABOUT OUR LIVES

04:17.200 --> 04:18.900
AND WRITE A POEM
ABOUT IT.

04:18.900 --> 04:19.400
A SHORT POEM.

04:19.400 --> 04:21.400
<i>Cory: TWO, </i>
<i>MAYBE THREE LINES, TOPS. </i>

04:21.400 --> 04:25.000
AND IT DOESN'T EVEN
HAVE TO RHYME.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.967
IS THIS TRUE?

04:28.100 --> 04:31.000
YEP.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.467
Miss Chase: GREAT.

04:32.467 --> 04:35.400
MY MAJOR AT THE
UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA

04:35.400 --> 04:38.367
WAS POETRY...EPIC POETRY.

04:38.367 --> 04:43.200
IN FACT, MY DISSERTATION
WAS ON <i>BEOWULF, </i>

04:43.200 --> 04:44.233
AN 8th CENTURY POEM

04:44.233 --> 04:47.400
WRITTEN IN 3,200 LINES
OF OLD ENGLISH.

04:47.400 --> 04:48.600
LET'S SEE
IF WE CAN KNOCK OUT

04:48.600 --> 04:53.400
THE FIRST 1,600 LINES
BEFORE LUNCH, SHALL WE?

04:53.400 --> 04:56.734
AAH!
AAH!

04:57.967 --> 05:00.734
[MUSIC PLAYING]

05:56.400 --> 05:58.200
I CAN'T BELIEVE
MR. FEENY

05:58.200 --> 05:59.734
ACTUALLY MISSED
A DAY OF SCHOOL.

05:59.734 --> 06:03.900
WELL, YOU KNOW WHO YOU CAN
THANK FOR THAT, DON'T YOU?

06:03.900 --> 06:04.567
ZEUS?

06:04.567 --> 06:08.300
ME! I WISHED FOR HIM
TO GET SICK, AND HE DID.

06:08.300 --> 06:10.200
YOU DIDN'T WISH
FOR HIM TO GET SICK.

06:10.200 --> 06:13.100
SURE, I DID, YESTERDAY,
WHEN WE WEREN'T STUDYING.

06:13.100 --> 06:14.467
EVEN IF YOU DID,
YOU CAN'T MAKE

06:14.467 --> 06:17.200
SOMETHING HAPPEN JUST
BECAUSE YOU SAY IT.

06:17.200 --> 06:18.200
THE POWER
OF THE MIND

06:18.200 --> 06:20.200
IS NOT TO BE TAKEN
LIGHTLY, SHAWN.

06:20.200 --> 06:21.200
FORCE OF WILL

06:21.200 --> 06:23.967
IS THE MOST POWERFUL
WEAPON ON EARTH.

06:29.300 --> 06:31.000
NO. NO, IT'S NOT.

06:32.500 --> 06:35.233
MAYBE I DO HAVE
SOME KIND OF STRANGE POWER

06:35.233 --> 06:36.300
LIKE THE X-MEN,

06:36.300 --> 06:39.367
ONLY I HAVE THE POWER
TO MAKE PEOPLE SICK.

06:39.367 --> 06:42.400
YEAH. IT'S WORKING
ON ME RIGHT NOW.

06:42.400 --> 06:45.100
MAYBE I'LL CALL MYSELF...

06:45.100 --> 06:46.233
SICK BOY.

06:46.233 --> 06:49.467
SICK BOY, POSSESSOR OF
A STRANGE MUTANT POWER,

06:49.467 --> 06:51.400
CAN, WITH A GLANCE
OF HIS SICKENING EYE,

06:51.400 --> 06:54.934
MAKE OTHERWISE HEALTHY MEN
BEND OVER THE TOILET

06:54.934 --> 06:57.967
AND GO, "HUAHH!"

06:57.967 --> 06:59.100
ALL RIGHT, SICK BOY.

06:59.100 --> 07:02.233
IF YOU CAN DO IT,
DO IT TO HIM.

07:02.233 --> 07:03.367

07:03.367 --> 07:07.233
HEY, MINKUS.
MINKUS, COME HERE.

07:07.233 --> 07:08.300
WHEN YOUR MOTHER
CUTS YOUR HAIR,

07:08.300 --> 07:12.133
TELL HER TO TAKE THE OATMEAL
OUT OF THE BOWL.

07:12.133 --> 07:13.200
SORRY, SHAWN,

07:13.200 --> 07:14.400
BUT I DON'T
HAVE THE ENERGY

07:14.400 --> 07:16.200
TO TRADE INSULTS
TODAY.

07:16.200 --> 07:18.900
I'M NOT FEELING
VERY WELL.

07:21.000 --> 07:21.500

07:21.500 --> 07:24.200
WHAT CAN I SAY?
IT'S A GIFT.

07:24.200 --> 07:26.400
MINKUS, YOU WERE ALL RIGHT
IN CLASS THIS MORNING.

07:26.400 --> 07:29.400
WHEN, EXACTLY, DID YOU
START FEELING TERRIBLE?

07:29.400 --> 07:32.400
WHEN I HEARD MR. FEENY'S
IN THE HOSPITAL.

07:32.400 --> 07:36.300
THE HOSPITAL?
SOUNDS SERIOUS.

07:36.300 --> 07:38.300
FOR MR. FEENY
AND FOR YOU.

07:38.300 --> 07:41.200
WHY ME? WHY'S IT
SERIOUS FOR ME?

07:41.200 --> 07:46.000

AROUND COMES AROUND.

07:47.567 --> 07:52.700
THE HOSPITAL?

07:54.000 --> 07:55.467
ME? I DIDN'T DO THIS.

07:55.467 --> 07:57.300
YOU WISHED
HE WOULD GET SICK.

07:57.300 --> 07:58.600
I DIDN'T WISH FOR HIM
TO GET SICK.

07:58.600 --> 08:02.100
SURE, YOU DID, YESTERDAY,
WHEN WE WEREN'T STUDYING.

08:02.100 --> 08:03.500
SHAWN, YOU SAID IT
YOURSELF.

08:03.500 --> 08:06.100
JUST BECAUSE YOU WANT
SOMETHING TO HAPPEN

08:06.100 --> 08:08.400
DOESN'T MEAN
IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.

08:08.400 --> 08:10.133

DON'T LOOK AT ME!

08:36.500 --> 08:39.000
IT'S A GET WELL CARD
FOR MR. FEENY.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.300
HERE, YOU SIGN IT,
TOO.

08:40.300 --> 08:41.467
I DON'T THINK SO, MOM.

08:41.467 --> 08:43.200
SUIT YOURSELF.
I JUST WANTED

08:43.200 --> 08:45.233
TO GET HIM OUT OF
THE HOSPITAL FASTER.

08:45.233 --> 08:46.567
HOW'S A CARD
GOING TO DO THAT?

08:46.567 --> 08:50.100
IT CHEERS HIM UP.
POWER OF POSITIVE THINKING.

08:50.100 --> 08:51.400
WAIT A MINUTE.
MOM, MOM, MOM.

08:51.400 --> 08:53.467
YOU'RE SAYING
SOMEONE CAN GET BETTER

08:53.467 --> 08:56.000
JUST 'CAUSE SOMEONE
WISHES THEY WILL?

08:56.000 --> 08:56.500
YEAH.

08:56.500 --> 08:59.967
DOES THE OPPOSITE
OF THAT WORK, TOO?

08:59.967 --> 09:00.467
CAN SOMEONE GET SICK

09:00.467 --> 09:02.133
JUST 'CAUSE SOMEONE
SAYS THEY WILL?

09:02.133 --> 09:06.500
WELL, THAT IS THE PRINCIPLE
BEHIND VOODOO CURSES.

09:06.500 --> 09:09.300
BUT YOU'D HAVE TO GO TO,
LIKE, A VOODOO ACADEMY

09:09.300 --> 09:11.567
TO PULL OFF SOMETHING
LIKE THAT, WOULDN'T YOU?

09:11.567 --> 09:14.400
I MEAN, YOUR AVERAGE
12-YEAR-OLD ON THE STREET

09:14.400 --> 09:15.500
COULDN'T GO AROUND
MAKING PEOPLE

09:15.500 --> 09:19.200
DROP LIKE FLIES,
COULD HE?

09:19.200 --> 09:20.233
NO REASON. NO INTEREST.

09:20.233 --> 09:24.700

WORDS ARE COMING OUT.

09:27.500 --> 09:30.300
ALL RIGHT, I WISHED REAL
HARD FOR FEENY TO GET SICK

09:30.300 --> 09:33.200
SO I WOULDN'T HAVE TO
TAKE THIS GEOGRAPHY TEST,

09:33.200 --> 09:34.934
AND HE GOT SICK.

09:34.934 --> 09:35.934
SO?

09:35.934 --> 09:37.000
SO, I DID THIS TO HIM.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.900
I HAVE THE GIFT.

09:38.900 --> 09:40.033
WHAT GIFT?

09:40.033 --> 09:41.567
I CAN MAKE PEOPLE
SICK.

09:41.567 --> 09:43.233
NOW, SEE, I'VE ALWAYS
KNOWN THAT, COR.

09:43.233 --> 09:45.300
WHY DO YOU THINK
I SLEEP WITH A BARF BAG?

09:45.300 --> 09:46.567
ERIC, I'M SERIOUS.

09:46.567 --> 09:50.000
YEAH, LIKE YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO MADE FEENY'S APPENDIX BLOW.

09:50.000 --> 09:50.500
HE HAS
APPENDICITIS?

09:50.500 --> 09:52.367
YEAH, HE'S GETTING
OPERATED ON RIGHT NOW.

09:52.367 --> 09:54.367
AN OPERATION.
THAT'S BAD.

09:54.367 --> 09:56.100
REMEMBER FLUFFY,
OUR CAT?

09:56.100 --> 09:57.500
HE DIED DURING
AN OPERATION.

09:57.500 --> 09:59.300
CORY, FLUFFY FELL
OUT OF A TREE.

09:59.300 --> 10:03.200
THEY WERE TRYING TO
SEW HIS HEAD BACK ON.

10:03.200 --> 10:06.033
IT WAS BIG ODDS
GOING IN.

10:10.467 --> 10:15.200
LOOK...I KNOW I DID NOT
CAUSE MR. FEENY TO GET SICK,

10:15.200 --> 10:17.934
BUT IT WOULD MAKE ME FEEL
A HECK OF A LOT BETTER

10:17.934 --> 10:18.667
IF YOU WOULD JUST GIVE ME

10:18.667 --> 10:23.734
SOME SORT OF SIGN THAT
HE'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.

10:34.133 --> 10:36.734
<i>Miss Chase: YESTERDAY </i>
<i>WE WERE ABSOLUTELY ENTHRALLED </i>

10:36.734 --> 10:42.200
<i>BY THE FIRST 1,600 </i>
<i>EXCITING LINES  </i>OF BEOWULF.

10:42.200 --> 10:43.400
[SNORING]

10:43.400 --> 10:46.033
CAN ANYONE RECAP
FOR US?

10:47.500 --> 10:50.467
HROTHGAR, KING OF THE DANES,
ON THE ISLAND OF ZEALAND,

10:50.467 --> 10:54.233
HAS BUILT THE MEAD HALL HEOROT
FOR FEASTING HIS WARRIORS,

10:54.233 --> 10:55.300
BUT THEY ABANDON IT
BECAUSE OF

10:55.300 --> 10:59.100
THE MURDEROUS RAVAGES
OF THE MONSTER GRENDEL.

10:59.100 --> 11:01.100
IS IT JUST ME,
OR DOES ANYONE ELSE

11:01.100 --> 11:04.133
WANT TO ABSOLUTELY
HURL FROM BOREDOM?

11:04.133 --> 11:07.200
DO YOU HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH <i>BEOWULF? </i>

11:07.200 --> 11:10.934
YEAH. MY PROBLEM
IS NOBODY CARES.

11:10.934 --> 11:12.100
I DON'T NEED THIS.

11:12.100 --> 11:13.200
WHEN AM I GOING TO
NEED THIS?

11:13.200 --> 11:15.400
NO ONE HAS EVER
NEEDED THIS.

11:15.400 --> 11:17.367
AND LET ME MAKE
MYSELF EVEN CLEARER.

11:17.367 --> 11:19.300
<i>BEOWULF </i>NEEDED? NO!

11:19.300 --> 11:22.100
AND ON A COMPLETELY
SIDE ISSUE,

11:22.100 --> 11:26.000
WHO NAMES THEIR BABY
HROTHGAR?

11:26.000 --> 11:27.400
ARE YOU THROUGH?

11:27.400 --> 11:29.367
NO. AS A MATTER
OF FACT, I'M NOT.

11:29.367 --> 11:31.300
I DON'T THINK WE NEED
GEOGRAPHY, EITHER.

11:31.300 --> 11:32.367
WELL, THIS IS A SCHOOL.

11:32.367 --> 11:33.567
WHAT DO YOU THINK
WE SHOULD DO HERE?

11:33.567 --> 11:37.133
I THINK WE SHOULD SIT AROUND
AND TALK ABOUT WHATEVER WE WANT,

11:37.133 --> 11:41.000
AND YOU SHOULD
MAKE US CUPCAKES.

11:42.100 --> 11:46.000
CORY MATTHEWS,
YOU ARE SO...RIGHT.

11:47.934 --> 11:49.200
SHAWN, SHAWN, WAKE UP!

11:49.200 --> 11:50.600
I FIXED EVERYTHING.

11:50.600 --> 11:54.200
THANK YOU FOR STOPPING ME
FROM WASTING MY ENTIRE LIFE.

11:54.200 --> 11:56.500
I MEAN, I WOULD HAVE
ENDED UP JUST LIKE MR. FEENY

11:56.500 --> 11:59.200
WHO BELIEVES IN GEOGRAPHY
AND MATHEMATICS

11:59.200 --> 12:01.233
AND THAT OTHER GARBAGE
YOU'LL NEVER NEED.

12:01.233 --> 12:04.500
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
THIS IS A TEACHER!

12:04.500 --> 12:08.934
HERE. WHY DON'T YOU PASS
THESE OUT TO EVERYBODY?

12:08.934 --> 12:10.233
WHEN DID YOU BAKE THESE?

12:10.233 --> 12:12.000
JUST THIS SECOND.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.033
I MOST HEARTILY
OBJECT

12:13.033 --> 12:14.200
TO THIS
FLAGRANT DESECRATION

12:14.200 --> 12:16.200
OF THE TEMPLE
OF KNOWLEDGE.

12:16.200 --> 12:19.000
STUFF IT, NERD BOY.

12:22.400 --> 12:26.867
MR. MATTHEWS,
WHO'S THE NEW TEACHER?

12:26.867 --> 12:27.967
KAREN.

12:27.967 --> 12:28.500
KAREN?

12:28.500 --> 12:33.200
YEAH. WE'RE ON
A FIRST NAME BASIS.

12:33.200 --> 12:34.300
COZY.

12:34.300 --> 12:36.400
AND WE'RE NOT TAKING
THAT GEOGRAPHY TEST, EITHER.

12:36.400 --> 12:39.100
IN FACT, WE'VE DONE AWAY
WITH GEOGRAPHY.

12:39.100 --> 12:40.200
NO ONE NEEDS IT.

12:40.200 --> 12:43.133
YOU MUST THINK YOU'VE DIED
AND GONE TO HEAVEN.

12:43.133 --> 12:45.300
YEP. NO OFFENSE,
BUT YOU COULD LEARN

12:45.300 --> 12:48.300
A LOT ABOUT TEACHING
FROM KAREN.

12:48.300 --> 12:51.967
WELL, I GUESS I'VE BEEN
AN OGRE ALL THESE YEARS, HMM?

12:51.967 --> 12:53.100
WHAT WAS I THINKING?

12:53.100 --> 12:54.100
NOBODY KNOWS.

12:54.100 --> 12:55.500
BUT ALL THAT STRESS
YOU PUT ON US

12:55.500 --> 12:58.133
PROBABLY JUST BOUNCED BACK
AND MADE YOU SICK.

12:58.133 --> 13:03.867
KARMA--WHAT GOES AROUND
GOES AROUND AND AROUND.

13:08.300 --> 13:09.367
YOU NEED TO LIGHTEN UP.

13:09.367 --> 13:12.934
WELL, THANK YOU FOR
THE ADVICE, MR. MATTHEWS.

13:12.934 --> 13:15.934
UH...LIKE THIS?

13:19.100 --> 13:20.300
CUT IT OUT, CORY.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.467
THAT WASN'T ME.
THAT WAS MR. FEENY.

13:22.467 --> 13:26.467
MR. FEENY?
TALK ABOUT A SICK JOKE.

13:26.467 --> 13:30.000
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
HE'S STANDING RIGHT HERE.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.367
OH, NURSE!

13:32.367 --> 13:34.934
HE CAN'T SEE ME,
MR. MATTHEWS.

13:34.934 --> 13:35.467
WHY NOT?

13:35.467 --> 13:38.367
BECAUSE HE'S NOT
THE ONE RESPONSIBLE.

13:38.367 --> 13:40.900
RESPONSIBLE
FOR WHAT?

13:40.900 --> 13:42.100
FOR KILLING ME.

13:42.100 --> 13:44.000
I DIED IN
THE HOSPITAL.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
WHAT?

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
I'M DEAD,
MR. MATTHEWS...

13:47.000 --> 13:49.700
THANKS TO YOU.

13:50.567 --> 13:54.100
DON'T DIE, MR. FEENY!
I DIDN'T MEAN TO KILL YOU!

13:54.100 --> 13:55.200
OH, MAN.

13:55.200 --> 13:58.200
ERIC, I JUST DREAMED
I KILLED MR. FEENY

13:58.200 --> 14:00.066
AND HE CAME BACK
TO HAUNT ME.

14:00.066 --> 14:03.033
IT WAS TERRIBLE.
ERIC?

14:03.033 --> 14:04.867
AAH!

14:06.000 --> 14:08.133
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

14:08.133 --> 14:10.834
I'M MEMORIZING
THE DICTIONARY,

14:10.834 --> 14:11.367
MR. MATTHEWS.

14:11.367 --> 14:13.400
MR. FEENY,
I JUST WOKE UP.

14:13.400 --> 14:15.033
YOU CAN'T BE HERE
ANYMORE.

14:15.033 --> 14:19.734
I CAN BE ANYWHERE
I WANT. I'M DEAD.

14:20.300 --> 14:22.500
YOU'RE NOT DEAD.
YOU CAN'T BE DEAD.

14:22.500 --> 14:25.200
I ONLY WANTED YOU
TO HAVE THE SNIFFLES.

14:25.200 --> 14:28.200
IT STARTED
WITH THE SNIFFLES.

14:28.200 --> 14:30.834
[SNIFFS]

14:44.934 --> 14:47.800
COR, YOU
LOOK TERRIBLE.

14:47.800 --> 14:49.800
COFFEE?

14:51.233 --> 14:54.200
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING WITH COFFEE?

14:54.200 --> 14:58.400
I ALWAYS DRINK COFFEE
AFTER I KILL A MAN.

14:58.400 --> 15:00.400
CORY, MR. FEENY'S
IN THE HOSPITAL

15:00.400 --> 15:02.200
BECAUSE OF
A BAD APPENDIX.

15:02.200 --> 15:03.233
NO MATTER WHAT
YOU WISHED,

15:03.233 --> 15:04.500
YOU HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH IT.

15:04.500 --> 15:07.200
BUT HOW COME I CAN'T
GET HIM OUT OF MY MIND?

15:07.200 --> 15:09.133
WHY AM I SEEING HIM
EVERYWHERE?

15:09.133 --> 15:10.367
BECAUSE YOU FEEL GUILTY.

15:10.367 --> 15:12.367
BECAUSE I WISHED
HE'D GET SICK.

15:12.367 --> 15:13.500
YEAH,
WHY'D YOU DO THAT?

15:13.500 --> 15:17.100
SO I WOULDN'T HAVE TO TAKE
HIS STUPID GEOGRAPHY TEST

15:17.100 --> 15:18.367
ABOUT STUFF
I'D NEVER NEED.

15:18.367 --> 15:20.300
YEAH,
I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL.

15:20.300 --> 15:23.100
I HAD A TEACHER IN
FOURTH GRADE--

15:23.100 --> 15:24.100
MISS PERCH.

15:24.100 --> 15:26.133
NOW, THE NAME PERCH
IMPLIES

15:26.133 --> 15:27.967
THAT SHE WAS A LOT
BETTER-LOOKING

15:27.967 --> 15:30.200
THAN
SHE ACTUALLY WAS.

15:30.200 --> 15:32.500
AND THIS RELATES
TO ME HOW?

15:32.500 --> 15:35.300
YOU KNOW WHY I'M THE MANAGER
DOWN AT THE SUPERMARKET?

15:35.300 --> 15:37.200
BECAUSE WHEN I STARTED OUT
AS A BOX BOY,

15:37.200 --> 15:39.567
I COULD ADD LONG COLUMNS
OF NUMBERS IN MY HEAD

15:39.567 --> 15:42.567
FASTER THAN THE CASHIERS
COULD AT THE MACHINES.

15:42.567 --> 15:45.200
I ALWAYS TOLD EVERYONE
IT WAS A NATURAL GIFT,

15:45.200 --> 15:46.200
BUT THE FACT IS

15:46.200 --> 15:48.300
I KNEW IT WAS A GIFT
FROM MISS PERCH.

15:48.300 --> 15:50.233
SO, WHY DID YOU
FEEL GUILTY?

15:50.233 --> 15:53.500
WELL, WHEN SHE WAS
TRYING TO TEACH ME MATH,

15:53.500 --> 15:55.934
I WAS THE KID IN
THE BACK OF THE ROOM

15:55.934 --> 15:56.467
ALWAYS GOING,

15:56.467 --> 16:01.233
"I'M NEVER
GONNA NEED THIS."

16:01.233 --> 16:04.300
BY THE TIME I FIGURED OUT
WHY I NEEDED IT,

16:04.300 --> 16:06.500
IT WAS TOO LATE
TO SAY THANK YOU.

16:06.500 --> 16:10.133
SO YOU'RE SAYING FEENY'S
TEACHING US STUFF NOW

16:10.133 --> 16:12.033
THAT WE'RE GONNA
NEED WHEN WE'RE OLDER.

16:12.033 --> 16:13.367
AND INSTEAD OF
SAYING THANK YOU,

16:13.367 --> 16:15.300
I WISHED FOR HIM
TO GET SICK.

16:15.300 --> 16:17.300
IS THAT WHY
I'M HAVING NIGHTMARES?

16:17.300 --> 16:19.000
YOUR NIGHTMARES
ARE JUST

16:19.000 --> 16:21.100
A MANIFESTATION
OF YOUR GUILT.

16:21.100 --> 16:22.200
YOU CREATED THEM.

16:22.200 --> 16:24.700
YOU CAN
CONTROL THEM.

16:26.600 --> 16:31.900
<i>Mr. Feeny: WHAT'S FOR </i>
<i>BREAKFAST, MR. MATTHEWS? </i>

16:31.900 --> 16:33.800
<i>DOWN HERE. </i>

16:33.800 --> 16:35.300
HOW YOU DOING?

16:35.300 --> 16:37.967
YOU DON'T SCARE ME
ANYMORE, MR. FEENY.

16:37.967 --> 16:38.500
YOU'RE NOT REAL.

16:38.500 --> 16:42.033
YOU'RE JUST
A MANIFESTATION OF MY GUILT.

16:42.033 --> 16:43.400
OOH. "MANIFESTATION."

16:43.400 --> 16:47.400
BIG WORD FOR SOMEONE WHO
CAN BARELY SPELL "CAT."

16:47.400 --> 16:52.033
I CREATED HIM.
I CAN MAKE HIM GO AWAY.

16:54.967 --> 16:56.734
WHEW.

16:59.800 --> 17:03.000
[LAUGHING]

17:24.834 --> 17:26.200
[KNOCK KNOCK]

17:26.200 --> 17:28.800
KNOCK KNOCK.

17:28.800 --> 17:31.000
MR. MATTHEWS.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.967
WHAT A SURPRISE.

17:32.967 --> 17:34.200
WHERE ARE
YOUR PARENTS?

17:34.200 --> 17:37.233
THEY DIDN'T BRING ME.
I TOOK THE BUS.

17:37.233 --> 17:41.200
ACTUALLY, THEY DON'T
EVEN KNOW I'M HERE.

17:41.200 --> 17:44.000
I BROUGHT YOU
A GERMANIUM.

17:45.867 --> 17:47.200
GERANIUM.

17:47.200 --> 17:49.233
DIDN'T I SAY
GERMANIUM?

17:49.233 --> 17:50.233
YES, YOU DID.

17:50.233 --> 17:54.133
IN FACT, GERMANIUM
IS A CHEMICAL ELEMENT.

17:54.133 --> 17:57.300
ATOMIC WEIGHT--72.59.

17:57.300 --> 17:59.967
IT'S USED
AS A SEMICONDUCTOR.

17:59.967 --> 18:03.300
YOUR BRAIN
MUST WEIGH SO MUCH.

18:03.300 --> 18:08.133
A GERANIUM
IS A LOVELY PLANT.

18:08.133 --> 18:09.200
IN CALIFORNIA,

18:09.200 --> 18:14.100
THEY CAN GROW TO
THE SIZE OF A BUSH.

18:14.100 --> 18:18.967
SO...THIS IS
A HOSPITAL, HUH?

18:18.967 --> 18:20.100
OH.

18:20.100 --> 18:21.867
IS THIS YOUR GRANDSON?

18:21.867 --> 18:23.133
NO.
NO WAY.

18:23.133 --> 18:24.934
NOT AT ALL.
WHAT HE SAID.

18:24.934 --> 18:26.200
THIS IS ONE
OF MY STUDENTS,

18:26.200 --> 18:27.200
CORY MATTHEWS.

18:27.200 --> 18:29.200
CORY, THIS
IS NURSE JILL.

18:29.200 --> 18:31.300
WELL, IT'S NICE TO SEE
ONE OF YOUR STUDENTS

18:31.300 --> 18:33.100
CAME TO VISIT YOU,
GEORGE.

18:33.100 --> 18:35.300
SHE CALLS YOU
BY YOUR FIRST NAME?

18:35.300 --> 18:38.100
DON'T BLOW IT FOR ME,
YOU LITTLE WEASEL.

18:38.100 --> 18:39.100
[LAUGHS]

18:39.100 --> 18:41.100
I STASHED TWO BOTTLES
OF THAT PINEAPPLE JUICE

18:41.100 --> 18:44.033
YOU LIKE IN CASE
YOU AND YOUR NONGRANDSON

18:44.033 --> 18:45.200
WANT TO HAVE ONE.

18:45.200 --> 18:46.400
I AM ETERNALLY
GRATEFUL.

18:46.400 --> 18:49.233
CORY, YOU STAY
AS LONG AS YOU LIKE.

18:49.233 --> 18:53.000
AND IF A BIG DRAGON IN A HAT
THAT SAYS "HEAD NURSE"

18:53.000 --> 18:54.100
TRIES TO KICK YOU OUT,

18:54.100 --> 18:57.934
YOU TELL HER
YOU'RE A FRIEND OF JILL'S, OK?

18:57.934 --> 18:59.000
OK.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.100
SEE YOU LATER, GEORGE.

19:01.100 --> 19:03.834
SHE SEEMS NICE.

19:03.834 --> 19:08.100
YES, INDEED.
VERY NICE.

19:08.100 --> 19:12.233
DID WE JUST HAVE,
LIKE, A GUY MOMENT?

19:12.233 --> 19:14.967
YES, I SUPPOSE WE DID.

19:14.967 --> 19:17.400
WHY ARE YOU HERE,
MR. MATTHEWS?

19:17.400 --> 19:20.300
I MEAN, A HOSPITAL
IS A VERY SCARY PLACE.

19:20.300 --> 19:24.300
I GUESS I WANTED TO SEE WITH
MY OWN EYES THAT YOU'RE OK.

19:24.300 --> 19:27.000
THANK YOU FOR
YOUR GOOD THOUGHTS.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.100
AND THAT
YOU'RE NOT DEAD.

19:28.100 --> 19:30.300
OH, I CAN'T DIE,
MR. MATTHEWS.

19:30.300 --> 19:33.033
I HAVE TOO MUCH WORK
LEFT UNDONE,

19:33.033 --> 19:36.200
TOO MANY STUDENTS
LEFT UNTAUGHT.

19:36.200 --> 19:37.200
LIKE ME?

19:37.200 --> 19:38.500
ESPECIALLY YOU.

19:38.500 --> 19:43.967
IN A STRANGE WAY,
YOU'VE KEPT ME ALIVE.

19:43.967 --> 19:44.500
I'M GLAD.

19:44.500 --> 19:46.567
BECAUSE THERE STILL
MIGHT BE SOME STUFF

19:46.567 --> 19:50.100
YOU'RE GOING TO TEACH ME
THAT I'M GONNA NEED SOMEDAY.

19:50.100 --> 19:51.100
LIKE WHAT?

19:51.100 --> 19:52.400
LIKE, SAY I'M WALKING
DOWN THE STREET,

19:52.400 --> 19:54.400
AND SOME GUY
COMES UP TO ME AND SAYS,

19:54.400 --> 19:57.100
"WHAT'S THE ATOMIC WEIGHT
OF GERANIUM?"

19:57.100 --> 19:58.467
THANKS TO YOU,
I'LL BE ABLE TO SAY,

19:58.467 --> 20:00.967
"THAT'S A PLANT,
YOU IDIOT."

20:00.967 --> 20:02.200
[LAUGHS]

20:02.200 --> 20:05.867
DRAGON ALERT.
LAY LOW.

20:05.867 --> 20:06.400
MAYBE I'D BETTER GO

20:06.400 --> 20:07.567
SO I DON'T GET
NURSE JILL IN TROUBLE.

20:07.567 --> 20:10.467
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR
COMING, MR. MATTHEWS.

20:10.467 --> 20:13.200
YOU'VE MADE ME FEEL
MUCH BETTER.

20:13.200 --> 20:16.033
I FEEL BETTER, TOO.

20:19.100 --> 20:22.000
MR. FEENY...

20:22.000 --> 20:23.133
THANK YOU.

20:23.133 --> 20:24.934
FOR WHAT?

20:24.934 --> 20:28.000
I DON'T KNOW YET.

20:42.467 --> 20:45.300
HEY, COR,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

20:45.300 --> 20:49.000
I'M TRYING TO FIX
MR. FEENY'S DUMB DUCK.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.967
HE'S COMING HOME
TOMORROW.

20:50.967 --> 20:51.500
OH, THAT'S NICE.

20:51.500 --> 20:53.367
LOOKS LIKE IT COULD
USE SOME BRACING.

20:53.367 --> 20:57.200
BRACING, RIGHT.
CAN I BORROW YOUR TOOLS?

20:57.200 --> 20:59.000
SURE.

21:02.100 --> 21:04.400
GOOD MORNING,
MR. MATTHEWS.

21:04.400 --> 21:06.400
MR. FEENY,
YOU'RE HOME EARLY.

21:06.400 --> 21:10.300
WELL, I GOT MOST
OF MY STRENGTH BACK.

21:10.300 --> 21:13.000
BESIDES, THEY
REPLACED NURSE JILL

21:13.000 --> 21:15.033
WITH NURSE LARRY.

21:16.300 --> 21:18.700
I FIGURED IT WAS
TIME TO LEAVE.

21:20.233 --> 21:23.000
I'M TRYING
TO FIX YOUR DUCK.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.400
YES, SO I SEE.
THANK YOU.

21:24.400 --> 21:26.233
WHY DON'T YOU
TAKE A BREAK

21:26.233 --> 21:29.133
AND HELP ME
PLANT THIS?

21:29.133 --> 21:32.900
YOU'RE PUTTING MY PUNY
PLANT IN THE GROUND?

21:32.900 --> 21:33.400
YOUR PLANT,

21:33.400 --> 21:36.133
THOUGH IMMATURE
AND UNDEVELOPED,

21:36.133 --> 21:39.200
HAS WITHIN IT
THE POTENTIAL

21:39.200 --> 21:42.200
TO GROW AND FLOWER

21:42.200 --> 21:45.000
WITH THE HELP OF
A PROPER GARDENER.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.200
YOU THINK SO?

21:46.200 --> 21:48.133
OH, YES,

21:48.133 --> 21:52.600
AS LONG AS NO ONE
WISHES IT ILL.

22:05.300 --> 22:08.233
IF WE THINK IT CAN HAPPEN,
IT WILL HAPPEN.

22:08.233 --> 22:11.033
YOU'RE SAYING WE CAN
LIGHT THAT LIGHT BULB

22:11.033 --> 22:12.133
WITHOUT ANY ELECTRICITY?

22:12.133 --> 22:15.400
THE GREATEST POWER COMPANY
OF ALL IS THE HUMAN MIND.

22:15.400 --> 22:19.000
APPARENTLY SHAWN
DIDN'T PAY HIS BILL.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.700
THOSE ARE CUTE
LAST WORDS.

22:21.700 --> 22:22.200
SHH.

22:22.200 --> 22:24.200
LET'S FOCUS
OUR PSYCHIC ENERGIES

22:24.200 --> 22:26.100
ON LIGHTING
THE BULB.

22:26.100 --> 22:28.000
THERE'S NO PLACE
LIKE HOME.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.700
THERE'S NO PLACE
LIKE HOME.

22:30.700 --> 22:31.667
QUIET.

22:33.100 --> 22:36.300
UH, NONE OF THE ELECTRICITY
MADE IT TO THE BULB, TOPANGA.

22:36.300 --> 22:38.900
IT ALL GOT STUCK
IN YOUR HAIR.

22:38.900 --> 22:40.100
THERE'S YOUR PROBLEM.

22:40.100 --> 22:42.300
NO ONE HERE IS TAKING
THIS SERIOUSLY.

22:42.300 --> 22:45.300
THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT
YOUR EXPERIMENT, TOPANGA.

22:45.300 --> 22:47.000
THE ONLY WAY
TO DEMONSTRATE

22:47.000 --> 22:48.400
THE POWER OF
THEIR SELFISH MINDS

22:48.400 --> 22:50.300
IS TO HAVE THEM
CONCENTRATE ON SOMETHING

22:50.300 --> 22:53.600
THEY REALLY WANT
TO SEE HAPPEN.

22:59.900 --> 23:01.133
COOL!
COOL!

23:01.133 --> 23:04.567
WHAT? THE BULB
DIDN'T LIGHT.
