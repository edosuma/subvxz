an opportunity to leave Miami.

that Nicole was talking about

49:26.130 --> 49:28.899
being her for Colton
is her "opportunity

49:28.899 --> 49:30.334

49:35.973 --> 49:37.241

49:37.241 --> 49:39.109
told him exactly
what Elyse told me.

49:39.109 --> 49:41.011

'cause I actually

49:41.011 --> 49:42.046

for that conversation,

49:42.046 --> 49:44.715

any of that.

49:44.715 --> 49:46.350

you went to go tell Colton...

And that was the first time
that word "bullying"

1:19:15.985 --> 1:19:17.219

At this point, I don't care.
Honestly, like, whatever--

1:19:19.088 --> 1:19:20.956

1:19:22.758 --> 1:19:23.759

1:19:23.759 --> 1:19:24.827
Now Colton thinks poorly

- Just to--you know,

1:19:32.001 --> 1:19:33.068

your relationship

understand why, like,

1:19:56.925 --> 1:19:58.961
this story,
you know, was fabricated

1:19:58.961 --> 1:20:00.195
instead of telling me
I'm emotionally unstable--

1:20:00.195 --> 1:20:02.197
- Colton, I told you exactly
what Elyse told me,

1:20:02.197 --> 1:20:03.799
and I wasn't there
for the conversation--

1:20:03.799 --> 1:20:04.967
- She's not here anymore.

1:20:04.967 --> 1:20:06.869
This just--this is between me,
you, and now Colton.

1:20:06.869 --> 1:20:08.137
Like, you've put us

1:20:08.137 --> 1:20:10.673
- I just came over here because
I heard you guys yelling.

1:20:10.673 --> 1:20:12.541
- Colton's sitting there

1:20:12.541 --> 1:20:13.676

1:20:13.676 --> 1:20:14.910
- You guys, Colton

1:20:17.613 --> 1:20:19.915
- Demi!
- What, you don't?

1:20:19.915 --> 1:20:21.083

1:20:21.083 --> 1:20:22.885

and that's bullying.

1:20:22.885 --> 1:20:23.952

you're switching it around.

1:20:23.952 --> 1:20:25.154
- I have never--
see, I have never

1:20:25.154 --> 1:20:26.789

1:20:26.789 --> 1:20:27.790
- You've hurt everyone

1:20:27.790 --> 1:20:28.991
- Who?
- You even told me that

1:20:28.991 --> 1:20:30.192

to all the other girls.

1:20:30.192 --> 1:20:31.860
Like, if you heard something,
you're willing to...

1:20:31.860 --> 1:20:32.861
- I said if something was
brought to my attention--

1:20:32.861 --> 1:20:33.962
- Like, ruin their lives.

1:20:33.962 --> 1:20:35.764
- This is really,
really awkward.

1:20:35.764 --> 1:20:36.832
- It's easy to cut me off
when I speak.

1:20:36.832 --> 1:20:38.000
- You don't--you don't--
- It's easy to go

1:20:38.000 --> 1:20:39.802
behind my back and tell me
I'm emotionally unstable.

1:20:39.802 --> 1:20:40.969
- Nicole, you literally--
Nicole, wait, wait, wait.

1:20:40.969 --> 1:20:42.071
- And now it's easy
to tell Colton

1:20:42.071 --> 1:20:43.272
that I'm here for
the wrong reasons, 'cause

1:20:43.272 --> 1:20:45.140
you don't want me to be here.
You just admitted it.

1:20:45.140 --> 1:20:46.775
I just know that
you have no basis

1:20:46.775 --> 1:20:47.943
to, like, want to,
like, hurt me,

1:20:47.943 --> 1:20:49.878
like, except for that
I'm an easy target

1:20:49.878 --> 1:20:51.947
and that you ran out of
your bells and whistles

1:20:51.947 --> 1:20:52.981
and now I'm that target.

1:20:52.981 --> 1:20:54.049
And instead of
coming up to me--

1:20:54.049 --> 1:20:55.217
- I didn't--
- This all could have

1:20:55.217 --> 1:20:56.785
been avoided.
- I thought you guys could--

1:20:56.785 --> 1:20:58.087
- You think
I'm emotionally unstable.

1:20:58.087 --> 1:20:59.221
- I didn't say you were
emotionally unstable.

1:20:59.221 --> 1:21:00.789
- You really make me feel
like I--like I'm--

1:21:00.789 --> 1:21:01.857
- I just--I want--

1:21:01.857 --> 1:21:02.925
- Right now,
'cause Colton's here,

1:21:02.925 --> 1:21:04.159
you're being,
like, very, like--

1:21:04.159 --> 1:21:05.794
you're not raising your voice.
- Nicole, how many times--

1:21:05.794 --> 1:21:07.029
how many times
have we sat down--

1:21:07.029 --> 1:21:08.831
- [sighs]

1:21:08.831 --> 1:21:10.733
