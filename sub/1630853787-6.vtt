Previously on High School Musical:
The Musical: <i>The Series...</i>

00:04.129 --> 00:06.589
- It's <i>The Real Campers of Shallow Lake.</i>

00:06.673 --> 00:09.759
For the first time in my life,
I may have overdone it with the drama.

00:10.176 --> 00:11.886
<i>I told a sister to crush on her brother.</i>

00:12.012 --> 00:13.722
Jet. You know Maddox? She's hot for you.

00:13.722 --> 00:16.057
I told Ricky to be in love with Gina.

00:16.141 --> 00:18.309
It's possible I wasn't pretending
to crush on Gina.

00:18.393 --> 00:21.062
<i>Even though some of us
have meltdowns like actual snowmen...</i>

00:21.187 --> 00:22.480
Okay. Stop.

00:22.564 --> 00:25.233
Val, maybe now is not the time.
Read the room.

00:25.233 --> 00:27.110
I'm here, aren't I? I'm trying.

00:27.110 --> 00:28.278
I'm still standing.

00:29.696 --> 00:32.157
I don't wanna feel like
you're keeping things from me.

00:32.157 --> 00:34.117
I'm not leaving Salt Lake without a fight.

01:15.075 --> 01:18.620
Rise and shine, Shallow Lake!
Intruder! Get him!

01:18.620 --> 01:19.996
Ricky, stop. It's Mr. Bleu.

01:22.082 --> 01:25.126
- What if I didn't have a shirt on?
- Looks like you have three shirts on.

01:25.418 --> 01:28.630
- You. You filmed me behind the bush.
- Hey, you. Up.

01:33.426 --> 01:34.469
Cute duck.

01:37.972 --> 01:41.476
I'm calling it.
Corbin Bleu has officially lost his mind.

01:41.935 --> 01:42.936
Cute duck.

01:43.686 --> 01:47.774
Folks, we're two hours away
from Camp Shallow Lake's

01:47.774 --> 01:49.442
most exciting tradition.

01:49.567 --> 01:53.154
Tune in to see a bunch of theater kids
get their heads out of the clouds

01:53.655 --> 01:54.697
and into the game.

01:54.906 --> 01:56.825
I'm praying the game is chess.

01:57.617 --> 02:02.038
Report to the amphitheater at 8:00 a.m.
sharp for a day of sports. It's Color War!

02:15.135 --> 02:17.512
Then turn the paddle up
near the ceiling near the end.

02:17.512 --> 02:18.972
- Over and over again.
- Like that?

02:18.972 --> 02:20.265
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Okay.

02:20.265 --> 02:22.642
- Yeah, got it. Natural.

02:22.642 --> 02:24.227
You just gotta commit to one side.

02:25.311 --> 02:28.022
Of the canoe. Or else you'll fall out.
You'll be fine.

02:29.232 --> 02:31.442
Thanks for being
my last-minute Color War tutor.

02:32.068 --> 02:34.654
I can't believe that
you're actually bad at sports.

02:35.071 --> 02:40.034
Yep. Hey, Gadget, can I ask you something?

02:41.286 --> 02:45.582
Is it about my brother,
and why no one knew we were siblings?

02:46.457 --> 02:47.500
No comment.

02:47.876 --> 02:49.127
Hmm.

02:49.127 --> 02:54.007
Well, I guess I can answer that question
with a question. Do you have a brother?

02:54.007 --> 02:55.258
Yeah.

02:55.258 --> 02:58.970
Is everything between you
super great all the time?

02:59.804 --> 03:01.681
- Enough said.
- Yeah.

03:02.724 --> 03:05.810
We were really, really close
when we were little.

03:06.477 --> 03:08.938
Which makes not being close
hurt even more.

03:10.064 --> 03:11.107
I get it.

03:13.651 --> 03:15.445
Oh, uh...

03:15.945 --> 03:19.115
Good morning. And ahoy?

03:19.741 --> 03:20.742
Elton.

03:23.620 --> 03:26.581
- Hey, do you mind if we just...
- Yeah. Good luck, sailors.

03:28.666 --> 03:31.794
While I have you, can we start over?

03:33.880 --> 03:37.091
Getting started is something
that I apparently don't do.

03:37.508 --> 03:38.843
I made a phone call last night.

03:39.469 --> 03:42.305
I'm taking some big steps
to make sure the show is perfect.

03:42.305 --> 03:43.890
EJ, this isn't about that.

03:44.390 --> 03:47.852
But a perfect show
is how I stay in Salt Lake.

03:48.645 --> 03:51.564
A perfect show means that my dad
sees that I'm great at something,

03:51.648 --> 03:53.608
and he doesn't send me
to leadership training.

03:55.151 --> 03:57.153
A perfect show is how I stay with you.

04:00.323 --> 04:02.909
Why don't we not talk about
the future for a sec?

04:03.952 --> 04:07.288
Let's make today amazing.
Here, come on in.

04:08.998 --> 04:10.124
The water's warm.

04:13.294 --> 04:16.547
Are you practicing for the canoe relay?
'Cause Dewey just pulled the plug.

04:16.673 --> 04:18.091
Somebody puked in the pool.

04:18.466 --> 04:20.051
Ah!

04:20.051 --> 04:23.554
Well, athletic glory has
never been my thing,

04:23.680 --> 04:27.225
and I'm not great with a ball.
So I thought I'd have a shot in a boat.

04:28.685 --> 04:31.646
But honestly, I just want us to win today.

04:32.855 --> 04:34.691
Then I'll make sure
we're on the same team.

04:35.817 --> 04:36.943
I like that plan.

04:40.071 --> 04:41.656
Okay, meet me at the amphitheater.

04:44.993 --> 04:50.123
- Oh, was anyone in here looking for me?
- Mmm, were you expecting someone?

04:50.832 --> 04:52.667
Nope. Nope.

04:54.002 --> 04:56.212
See you on the amphitheater, skipper.

05:07.015 --> 05:09.100
- Hey, Mr. Bleu.
- Hey, Thomas.

05:11.519 --> 05:12.562
Okay, then.

05:12.562 --> 05:16.024
Uh, yesterday, Channing got some
really embarrassing footage of me,

05:16.190 --> 05:19.652
and I would love for you to delete it,
if that's possible.

05:20.320 --> 05:23.614
Very cool, son.
Won't happen, but very cool.

05:23.698 --> 05:26.576
Unless you praise Nickelodeon,
it's going in the doc.

05:28.703 --> 05:33.333
When I heard that the camp that's
putting on <i>Frozen</i> for Disney Plus

05:33.333 --> 05:39.714
has a day that's emotionally similar
to the 2006 to 2008 <i>Disney Channel Games,</i>

05:40.423 --> 05:43.009
I and the folks at the Mouse HQ

05:43.134 --> 05:46.220
jumped at the chance
to include this in our docu-series.

05:46.971 --> 05:49.140
Dewey, you wanna explain the rules?

05:50.350 --> 05:51.476
Uh...

05:51.476 --> 05:57.982
Yeah. Every camper is required
to participate in a few challenges.

05:58.191 --> 06:02.862
- There's two teams...
- And within each team are teammates.

06:03.988 --> 06:08.368
Okay, I got this. Okay.
You know her. You love her.

06:08.910 --> 06:11.621
The captain of the Yellow Team is Maddox.

06:13.206 --> 06:15.875
Not sure everyone loves me. But thank you.

06:17.043 --> 06:18.086
Didn't say they all did.

06:18.628 --> 06:23.591
And the captain of the blue team,
the director of the show within the show.

06:23.716 --> 06:27.303
Some people call him Spaceship Man.
It's EJ.

06:27.970 --> 06:29.722
- Yeah, EJ.

06:30.723 --> 06:32.809
Now, with a big smile,

06:33.142 --> 06:36.104
tell the camera which of your
<i>Frozen</i> friends are on each team.

06:36.771 --> 06:38.022
What about the other campers?

06:38.564 --> 06:40.441
We had to blur their faces out
for the doc,

06:40.608 --> 06:44.404
so, legally we aren't naming any other
names unless they've signed a release.

06:44.904 --> 06:46.989
- Yeah.
- Okay.

06:47.865 --> 06:49.700
Um...

06:49.784 --> 06:53.955
On my team,
we have Ricky, Ashlyn and Gina.

06:56.958 --> 06:59.168
- We're gonna make a great team.
- Mmm-hmm.

07:01.587 --> 07:05.675
And then Maddox's team
has Kourtney, Carlos and Jet.

07:14.767 --> 07:19.230
Just so y'all know, I'm scrappy.
I fight dirty, and I will cheat.

07:19.647 --> 07:23.568
- Hmm! So it's in the bag.
- I'm also incredibly afraid of heights.

07:23.818 --> 07:25.736
Okay, so plus, minus.

07:26.487 --> 07:31.159
Guys, if you were on a deserted island
and could text one person,

07:31.784 --> 07:32.785
who would it be?

07:33.369 --> 07:35.872
Your mom? Your ex? Your life coach?

07:36.622 --> 07:40.293
Tomorrow, the winning team
can text whoever they want

07:40.501 --> 07:41.961
when they get back their phones!

07:45.256 --> 07:47.300
That's against Shallow Lake policy.
We are not...

07:47.300 --> 07:49.218
Get your team colors from the bins.

07:49.510 --> 07:52.805
I'm Corbin Bleu,
and you're watching Disney Plus.

08:00.396 --> 08:01.522
Hey.

08:02.523 --> 08:04.817
Uh, Ashlyn,
you have another letter from...

08:04.901 --> 08:05.985
My male boyfriend.

08:06.402 --> 08:08.529
You know, those two words
mean the same thing.

08:08.988 --> 08:11.157
- Just being clear.
- Are you?

08:11.741 --> 08:15.328
'Cause it feels like maybe
you're compensating for something.

08:16.496 --> 08:18.581
Okay, Anna Freud. And what would that be?

08:19.707 --> 08:22.126
I wouldn't know
without hours of conversation.

08:22.418 --> 08:23.753
You're just super complex.

08:24.170 --> 08:27.340
There's an edge to you,
but you have so much love inside of you.

08:28.257 --> 08:31.719
It's a beautiful puzzle. And I wouldn't
presume to tell you anything.

08:33.304 --> 08:39.268
Okay. Thank you.
That was the nicest thing ever.

08:40.603 --> 08:41.646
Good day.

08:47.860 --> 08:49.195
Let's go, Blue. Come on.

08:51.614 --> 08:53.908
Hey, buddy. You getting in the zone?

08:54.450 --> 08:55.451
Not exactly.

08:56.452 --> 08:58.913
I guess it was pretty intense last night.

09:00.540 --> 09:05.044
Do you think I'm the worst? For the stuff
that Maddie yelled at me about?

09:06.003 --> 09:08.631
I've done more than a few things
I'm ashamed of, dude.

09:08.798 --> 09:10.550
So I'm not one to judge.

09:11.592 --> 09:14.679
I thought those texts came from a guy,
and I was like,

09:14.679 --> 09:17.431
"Why does she get to date
when I'm not allowed to," you know?

09:17.515 --> 09:19.976
I mean, I just didn't really know
what I was looking at.

09:20.476 --> 09:23.896
- Does Maddox know this?
- Not sure she'd even hear me.

09:24.855 --> 09:28.234
We used to sing together
all the time as kids. Now we barely talk.

09:32.321 --> 09:37.451
So, I once knew this girl who
was pretty mad at me, and I deserved it.

09:38.369 --> 09:40.204
But the one thing that really helped

09:40.288 --> 09:42.456
is I threw myself into
something she cared about.

09:42.832 --> 09:45.251
Like, I joined the show,
and I worked really hard.

09:45.835 --> 09:48.838
Is being a theater kid the answer to,
like, everything in your world?

09:49.672 --> 09:52.300
It doesn't always
have to be theater, but...

09:53.050 --> 09:56.846
Look, Maddox loves camp. It's Color War.

09:57.305 --> 10:01.309
Maybe you could help her win?
It's a 50-50 shot, dude.

10:01.309 --> 10:02.810
One team wins or the other does.

10:03.227 --> 10:06.188
There's a third option where
they burn the results in a pizza oven.

10:06.272 --> 10:10.067
I get it. That's good. Oh, man.

10:12.695 --> 10:13.863
Sorry I'm late.

10:15.156 --> 10:17.867
I can't believe
you came to help me.

10:19.869 --> 10:22.622
EJ, my tallest child.

10:23.331 --> 10:24.332
I've missed you.

10:25.207 --> 10:27.710
I made a pact to help any Wildcat in need,

10:27.877 --> 10:30.338
anywhere in
the contiguous lower 48 states.

10:30.838 --> 10:32.214
Where else would I be?

10:37.011 --> 10:43.142
I present to you the writings of a genius,
or a woman in desperate need of a nap.

10:44.310 --> 10:48.439
It's everything you'll need
to direct this musical successfully.

10:49.565 --> 10:53.527
<i>Jennifer's Guide to Directing Children
in the Modern Era.</i>

10:56.280 --> 10:59.408
- Twizzler?
- Did you get those from the woods?

11:00.409 --> 11:04.121
No. I got them from
the local shopkeeper, Susan.

11:04.664 --> 11:07.667
Fine selection of local wares they've got.
Really fine.

11:08.918 --> 11:10.544
Let's get to work, Mr. Director.

11:12.171 --> 11:13.214
Are these used?

11:17.593 --> 11:21.889
Then, you just throw the ball in the thing
and sometimes you make a face like this.

11:25.434 --> 11:27.561
- Oh!

11:28.521 --> 11:33.067
I don't understand what I'm looking at.
You... Didn't you actually play Troy?

11:33.067 --> 11:36.821
Okay, they had me in a harness
hanging from the ceiling. It's different.

11:38.072 --> 11:40.574
Since when have you cared so much
about basketball, anyway?

11:40.658 --> 11:44.036
Hey, I want to win today. With EJ.

11:45.079 --> 11:47.957
Yeah. Yeah, where is EJ, anyway?

11:48.290 --> 11:51.961
He should be here any second.

11:53.337 --> 11:55.631
What about this guy?
I bet he's got some B-ball tips.

11:56.882 --> 12:02.054
The Chad Danforth? My actual dance hero
since childhood? No, I do not think so.

12:02.763 --> 12:05.266
- I heard my name.
- You respond to "Chad"?

12:05.808 --> 12:08.728
Our characters never really leave us,
do they? What can I do?

12:09.186 --> 12:14.358
Well, I'm not exactly sure
that I'm a baller.

12:14.942 --> 12:18.779
I just don't understand how I can
be so coordinated on the dance floor

12:19.739 --> 12:21.657
and so clumsy on the court.

12:22.116 --> 12:24.702
Because you have to think
of them as the same place.

12:25.453 --> 12:26.871
- How?
- Look out!

12:29.790 --> 12:31.917
Gina? You okay?

12:40.551 --> 12:41.552
<i>Hey</i>

12:43.429 --> 12:46.932
<i>Stop, play it back
Did you not see how they move like that?</i>

12:47.057 --> 12:48.476
<i>Look, pay attention to me</i>

12:48.476 --> 12:51.270
<i>Hear the bounce, hear the beat
Sliding your feet too fast</i>

12:51.270 --> 12:53.439
<i>Gotta take it real smooth
Keep it cool</i>

12:53.439 --> 12:56.317
<i>Even if you don't know all the rules
Play the game</i>

12:56.317 --> 12:57.443
<i>All the same, win or lose</i>

12:57.651 --> 13:00.112
<i>Well, you never really lose
with the right attitude</i>

13:00.196 --> 13:04.116
<i>Notice your focus
And find your center</i>

13:04.241 --> 13:07.870
<i>I know that you know this
You just need to remember</i>

13:07.870 --> 13:11.123
<i>It's all about passion
One, two feet on the floor</i>

13:11.999 --> 13:14.043
<i>Move it like that
and see what might happen</i>

13:14.043 --> 13:17.630
<i>Ball's in your court
You think you can't work it?</i>

13:17.880 --> 13:21.759
<i>How about taking a chance?
Because at the end of the day</i>

13:21.759 --> 13:25.221
<i>It's just a different way to dance
It's just a different way to...</i>

13:25.971 --> 13:29.433
<i>Don't fight the technique
Let your body glide effortlessly</i>

13:30.267 --> 13:32.394
<i>They're up in your face
Just hit the jete</i>

13:32.478 --> 13:33.896
<i>You see what I mean?</i>

13:33.896 --> 13:35.481
<i>- What if I trip and fall?
- Forget it</i>

13:35.648 --> 13:37.608
<i>- What if I drop the ball?
- It happens</i>

13:37.608 --> 13:39.485
<i>I don't wanna risk it all</i>

13:39.485 --> 13:41.821
<i>You gotta
Even the best start out at the bottom</i>

13:41.821 --> 13:45.950
<i>Notice your focus
And find your center</i>

13:45.950 --> 13:49.662
<i>I know that you know this
You just need to remember</i>

13:49.662 --> 13:52.540
<i>It's all about passion
One, two feet on the floor</i>

13:52.540 --> 13:53.666
<i>Feet on the floor</i>

13:53.666 --> 13:55.709
<i>Move it like that
and see what might happen</i>

13:55.793 --> 13:57.920
<i>- Ball's in your court
- The ball's in my court</i>

13:58.087 --> 14:01.423
<i>You think you can't work it?
How about taking a chance?</i>

14:02.091 --> 14:05.261
<i>Because at the end of the day
It's just a different way to dance</i>

14:05.928 --> 14:08.013
<i>It's just a different way to dance</i>

14:10.015 --> 14:12.184
<i>It's just a different way to dance</i>

14:14.645 --> 14:16.522
<i>A different way to dance</i>

14:19.567 --> 14:23.404
<i>Practice ain't perfect
But you'll get better</i>

14:23.654 --> 14:27.199
<i>There's no competition
As long as you remember</i>

14:29.201 --> 14:32.329
<i>It's all about passion
One, two feet on the floor</i>

14:32.413 --> 14:33.414
<i>Feet on the floor</i>

14:33.414 --> 14:35.583
<i>Move it like that
and see what might happen</i>

14:35.583 --> 14:38.460
<i>Ball's in your court
You think you can't work it?</i>

14:38.544 --> 14:40.713
<i>- Work it
- How about taking a chance?</i>

14:40.713 --> 14:43.340
<i>- Taking a chance
- Because at the end of the day</i>

14:43.424 --> 14:47.803
<i>It's just a different way to dance
It's just a different way to dance</i>

14:48.846 --> 14:51.682
- <i>Oh, yeah
- It's just a different way to dance</i>

14:52.933 --> 14:56.353
<i>Different way to, different way to dance</i>

14:57.062 --> 15:00.190
<i>Different way to dance</i>

15:00.900 --> 15:01.942
<i>Dance</i>

15:08.449 --> 15:12.494
- Carlos? Wait. What happened?
- I don't know.

15:12.578 --> 15:17.291
You fell over and you were sort of
mumble-singing? It was super weird.

15:17.458 --> 15:19.877
But you still have
a chance to be the hero.

15:22.046 --> 15:24.089
For the record,
the Yellow Team is about to win

15:24.256 --> 15:27.259
unless you can make one shot
from the three-point line.

15:27.551 --> 15:28.677
Good luck, bestie.

15:28.761 --> 15:31.388
This would be very helpful for
the documentary if you succeed.

15:32.389 --> 15:34.433
You got this. Probably.

15:43.692 --> 15:44.693
Back up.

15:52.451 --> 15:54.411
- Blue Team wins!

15:58.958 --> 15:59.959
That's crazy.

16:02.628 --> 16:07.132
"Rule number one. Entering a room."
You need presence.

16:07.257 --> 16:11.220
As a director, one of my mottos is
"Presence is a present."

16:12.096 --> 16:13.180
Do what I do.

16:23.190 --> 16:24.400
We'll come back to that one.

16:25.943 --> 16:30.364
"Rule number four. Share a personal story
about how you relate to the text."

16:30.864 --> 16:33.242
Yoo-hoo! Big summer blowout.

16:34.493 --> 16:37.371
Every summer I look forward to
the Brooks Brothers' 4th of July sale.

16:37.913 --> 16:38.914
Love.

16:40.207 --> 16:41.291
"Rule number nine.

16:41.834 --> 16:46.630
"When in doubt, shove important-looking
papers into your binder and grimace."

16:48.799 --> 16:51.427
Mmm-mmm.

16:53.595 --> 16:57.891
Rule number 17. Get an assistant.
Someone like Carlos if he were here.

16:58.809 --> 17:01.770
- Carlos is here.
- Don't use Carlos. Carlos is Mommy's.

17:02.187 --> 17:03.230
Yes, ma'am.

17:04.398 --> 17:09.903
"And rule number 50. Never reveal
your true identity to the actors.

17:10.404 --> 17:12.322
"Mystery is everything."

17:14.658 --> 17:16.660
Like the way
nobody knows what "EJ" stands for.

17:17.703 --> 17:18.704
Check.

17:18.704 --> 17:21.623
- Oh, jeez. I am late for Dewey Says.

17:21.832 --> 17:24.710
- Dewey who?
- I'll explain later. I'll be right back.

17:25.169 --> 17:28.088
EJ, honey, it's killing me
that I can't see the others.

17:28.547 --> 17:29.715
I know, Miss Jenn,

17:29.715 --> 17:32.634
but they'd kill me if they saw how
underwater I am with the show.

17:32.760 --> 17:36.555
- You understand.
- I do. You go on.

17:43.479 --> 17:45.606
Dewey says hop on one foot.

17:47.274 --> 17:50.444
Hey, Dewey? Is Simon gonna
sue you for stealing his game?

17:50.694 --> 17:52.780
I don't know Simon personally.

17:53.072 --> 17:57.201
Breaking news. Dewey Wood locks
Simon of Simon Says in his basement.

18:01.455 --> 18:03.207
You're out. Buh-bye.

18:04.083 --> 18:05.084
Dewey says stop.

18:06.835 --> 18:07.961
Dewey says hop on one foot.

18:08.045 --> 18:10.839
Gina hasn't laughed at
one of my jokes since, like, Wednesday.

18:10.923 --> 18:15.260
I think she's just bummed that you
missed her basketball dance triumph thing.

18:15.677 --> 18:18.013
Trying to be in
six places at once this summer.

18:18.097 --> 18:19.640
Couldn't tell.

18:20.474 --> 18:23.102
Dewey says dance like
you're at the camp prom.

18:24.228 --> 18:25.687
- What'd you say?

18:26.313 --> 18:28.148
Did he say there's a camp prom?

18:28.232 --> 18:30.484
You. Stop.

18:33.362 --> 18:36.990
Dewey says spin in a circle.
Simon says stop.

18:37.658 --> 18:40.702
Oh! I'm Dewey, not Simon.
You two, you're out.

18:41.578 --> 18:45.958
Dewey says that is a great victory
for the Yellow Team. Congrats, you two.

18:47.835 --> 18:50.629
Hello, new person who's trying
really hard today.

18:51.505 --> 18:52.589
Let's keep it going.

18:57.469 --> 19:01.682
Dewey says get ready for
the climbing wall next. We're having fun.

19:02.933 --> 19:06.228
- Did he say "climbing wall"?
- Yeah. I'll meet you guys there.

19:06.562 --> 19:10.232
- Dude, where are you always going?
- Getting everything ready for the show.

19:10.232 --> 19:11.567
You can't do that at night?

19:11.817 --> 19:13.735
Well, Miss Jenn thinks
it's better to push...

19:13.944 --> 19:15.112
What?

19:16.864 --> 19:18.323
Oh, my gosh. This is so amazing. I can...

19:20.534 --> 19:21.618
Okay.

19:23.453 --> 19:26.415
- Wildcats.
- What are you doing here?

19:27.082 --> 19:29.668
EJ asked me for
a couple directing pointers

19:29.668 --> 19:32.880
and I had already been back from
my Caribbean cruise for 15 minutes,

19:33.172 --> 19:34.423
so I drove here.

19:34.882 --> 19:36.592
- Wow.
- Are you tired?

19:38.969 --> 19:42.014
It's starting to hit me.
Tell me about you.

19:42.014 --> 19:47.019
- What is happening with the show?
- Kourt and I got Elsa and Anna.

19:49.563 --> 19:50.898
I got Olaf.

19:50.898 --> 19:53.942
But there's no dressing room,
so I spend all day in the costume.

19:54.610 --> 19:55.611
Noted.

19:55.819 --> 19:58.447
And I'm Kristoff,
but maybe my dad already told you.

19:58.780 --> 20:02.367
Oh, and remind me later, he sent me
with an early birthday gift for you.

20:03.493 --> 20:06.330
Oh, and who are you playing, Ashlyn?

20:06.830 --> 20:10.334
Are you Anna and Elsa's long-lost sister
who they discover on ancestry.com?

20:10.626 --> 20:13.128
We're not allowed
to add parts to this one.

20:13.795 --> 20:16.548
I checked. Several times.

20:17.299 --> 20:19.259
I'm actually in the ensemble.

20:21.720 --> 20:24.223
A musical is a beautiful body.

20:25.682 --> 20:28.352
The ensemble is its sturdy backbone.

20:30.729 --> 20:33.023
Sorry, guys. We have
to get back to the climbing wall

20:33.023 --> 20:34.483
or we're gonna forfeit the game.

20:35.150 --> 20:38.278
- Oh, boy.
- Miss Jenn, do you wanna come watch?

20:38.528 --> 20:41.531
Oh, I don't have my theater glasses
or athletic footwear.

20:42.032 --> 20:44.660
Come on, Miss Jenn. Let's go to camp.

20:52.626 --> 20:54.670
- Oh, my goodness.
- It's big.

20:55.587 --> 20:59.174
This is our final athletic competition
before the big sing-off.

20:59.424 --> 21:03.887
We'll do a series of sprints <i>mano-a-mano,</i>
and one player will prevail each time.

21:04.513 --> 21:06.390
Okay, Kourtney, Gina, you're up.

21:06.390 --> 21:07.557
Whoo!

21:07.641 --> 21:10.060
Come on, Kourt.
Let's go, Gina. Whoo!

21:11.270 --> 21:15.065
Carlos, do you need
a quick change booth? For Olaf?

21:15.816 --> 21:18.193
I think I just need Ryan Gosling's torso.

21:19.194 --> 21:21.280
Someday, you may learn to love your own.

21:24.491 --> 21:27.369
- So, speaking of love...
- Mmm-hmm.

21:27.369 --> 21:31.790
Was there, like, a way you knew
you wanted to go on a boat with Mr. Bowen?

21:32.040 --> 21:35.585
Um, we shared a little kiss,
I saw fireworks,

21:35.669 --> 21:40.841
and the next thing you know, I'm lotioning
third-degree sunburn in St. Barts.

21:41.675 --> 21:45.554
But that's the way it's supposed to be,
right? No one can tell you what to feel.

21:46.596 --> 21:48.056
Is there something I should know?

21:49.141 --> 21:52.644
I've been yelling at
a few people this summer.

21:54.187 --> 21:56.773
You are allowed to have
more than one gear, sweetheart.

21:58.066 --> 22:00.277
Let's look alive, people. We're up next.

22:02.404 --> 22:05.532
- Tell me about the basketball triumph.
- You had to be there.

22:08.535 --> 22:11.747
- We're going through a little thing.
- I didn't ask.

22:12.914 --> 22:13.957
Let's do this.

22:15.876 --> 22:19.713
I just remembered that Idina Menzel
mentioned on a podcast

22:19.713 --> 22:22.215
that Elsa's actually afraid of heights.

22:22.299 --> 22:25.177
- Really? She lives in a tower.
- Not now, Carlos.

22:25.927 --> 22:26.970
Come on.

22:29.181 --> 22:30.265
Come on, Kourt.

22:31.683 --> 22:33.894
Three, two, one...

22:40.776 --> 22:41.777
You got this, Kourt.

22:47.699 --> 22:51.411
 Let's go, Yellow.
Let's go, Yellow.

22:51.495 --> 22:53.747
She is remarkably fast.

22:53.872 --> 22:56.416
Let's go, Blue. Let's go, Blue.

22:57.417 --> 23:00.087
Let's go, Blue. Let's go, Blue.

23:03.590 --> 23:06.635
Great. Gina won. We're done. We're done.

23:07.094 --> 23:08.720
But you have to at least try.

23:10.222 --> 23:16.311
Look, you all are amazing at
these games without even trying.

23:17.104 --> 23:19.272
If I were to try now
in front of all of you,

23:20.607 --> 23:22.484
I wouldn't be able
to control what happens.

23:22.984 --> 23:26.029
That's why we have to push through.
Even when it's hard.

23:26.613 --> 23:33.286
Kourtney. Kourtney. Kourtney.
Kourtney. Kourtney. Kourtney.

23:33.620 --> 23:37.416
- Kourtney.
- Campers. Mommy's talking.

23:39.376 --> 23:46.341
Kourtney, if I can just say, I think
you will climb the wall when you're ready.

23:50.470 --> 23:53.390
- I'm not. I'm saying I'm not.
- Okay.

24:00.730 --> 24:02.774
Well, I have got to get back on the road

24:02.858 --> 24:05.819
because I have a hard out at being
up more than 40 hours in a row.

24:06.862 --> 24:11.700
Hey, can't you just stay?
I never really mastered rule number 49.

24:12.325 --> 24:16.955
Honey, you have everything you need
to lead. And always have.

24:18.206 --> 24:20.917
And look who you're directing.
These kids are a dream.

24:21.835 --> 24:24.337
If they know their lines, you'll be fine.

24:25.505 --> 24:28.758
Thank you, Miss Jenn.
For everything, seriously.

24:29.676 --> 24:30.677
Richard?

24:33.680 --> 24:34.681
From your dad.

24:36.433 --> 24:39.436
Break a leg out there. Jennifer out.

24:43.398 --> 24:44.483
Where's the door?

24:51.740 --> 24:53.617
Okay. Hi.

24:53.825 --> 24:55.577
Um, it's a tie game,

24:55.577 --> 24:59.706
so the outcome of this cheer-off
determines the fate of Color War.

25:01.500 --> 25:06.171
Okay. So, this year, I have picked
<i>It's On</i> from <i>Camp Rock 2.</i>

25:06.171 --> 25:07.422
I printed out lyric sheets,

25:07.506 --> 25:10.258
but if you don't know the words,
that means something went wrong

25:10.342 --> 25:12.969
in your childhood
and you didn't watch this iconic sequel.

25:14.930 --> 25:20.185
And as a reminder, when I stop singing,
somebody has to take over. Here we go.

25:22.479 --> 25:24.648
- Drums.

25:24.648 --> 25:29.194
<i>A little guitar please
One, two, three, four</i>

25:29.361 --> 25:31.863
<i>I hope you're ready
for the time of your life</i>

25:32.197 --> 25:34.783
<i>Just look at me
I'll put a gleam in your eye</i>

25:35.408 --> 25:38.787
<i>Buckle up
We're gonna take you for a ride</i>

25:41.039 --> 25:43.708
<i>Let's go
We got you going good in the vibe</i>

25:44.084 --> 25:46.962
<i>- Everybody put your hands to the sky
- Hands to the sky</i>

25:47.170 --> 25:51.007
<i>Buckle up
We're gonna take you high</i>

25:52.551 --> 25:55.303
<i>Show me, show me, show me, show me
Show what you got</i>

25:55.637 --> 25:58.014
<i>Come on, come on, come on, come on
Ready or not</i>

25:58.098 --> 26:00.976
<i>La, la, la, la
Let me see how you bob</i>

26:00.976 --> 26:05.146
<i>It's on, it's on, it's on
Get crazy, crazy, crazy</i>

26:05.480 --> 26:09.901
<i>Take it over the top
'Cause when we rock, we let it rock</i>

26:10.068 --> 26:12.737
<i>Rock it, rock it, rock it, rock it
Dance till we drop</i>

26:12.988 --> 26:15.031
<i>It's on, it's on, it's on</i>

26:15.949 --> 26:20.245
- They're so good.
- Okay now. Are you ready? Let's go.

26:20.245 --> 26:23.373
<i>One, two, one, two, three, four</i>

26:23.373 --> 26:25.792
<i>Show stopping when I step in the place</i>

26:26.543 --> 26:29.045
<i>Before it's done
you're gonna beg me to stay</i>

26:29.254 --> 26:32.882
<i>Get on board
Come on, let's ride the wave</i>

26:35.176 --> 26:37.762
<i>Let's go, let's go
We just do what we do</i>

26:38.221 --> 26:40.557
<i>Watch me break and pop
I'll pass it to you</i>

26:40.890 --> 26:44.603
<i>You wanna rock like us
'cause we're never second place</i>

26:46.730 --> 26:49.232
<i>Show me, show me, show me, show me
Show what you got</i>

26:49.566 --> 26:52.235
<i>Come on, come on, come on, come on
Ready or not</i>

26:52.485 --> 26:57.198
<i>La, la, la, la, let me see how you bob
It's on, it's on, it's on</i>

26:58.158 --> 27:00.827
<i>Get crazy, crazy, crazy
Take it over the top</i>

27:01.369 --> 27:03.788
<i>'Cause when we rock, we let it rock</i>

27:04.247 --> 27:06.833
<i>Rock it, rock it, rock it
Just till we drop</i>

27:07.042 --> 27:10.253
<i>It's on, it's on, it's on</i>

27:11.379 --> 27:14.341
- Okay now. Are you ready?
- Yeah.

27:14.466 --> 27:17.260
<i>One, two, one, two, three</i>

27:17.594 --> 27:22.641
<i>There is no competition
That's why we in the number one position</i>

27:23.141 --> 27:26.311
<i>That crew can't hang with us, man
We too dangerous</i>

27:26.311 --> 27:29.272
<i>Ain't got the style or the stamina</i>

27:29.397 --> 27:31.941
<i>Just doing my thing
Get hooked on a swing</i>

27:32.067 --> 27:33.568
<i>Rocking the place
Dropping the bass</i>

27:33.652 --> 27:37.864
<i>- Making everyone sing</i>
- <i>Yeah, we make the bell ring</i>

27:37.989 --> 27:42.619
<i>- Make the bell ring
- It's on, it's on, it's on</i>

27:43.536 --> 27:46.164
<i>It's on, it's on, it's on</i>

27:46.373 --> 27:49.125
<i>It's on, it's on, it's on, it's on</i>

27:49.250 --> 27:52.003
<i>It's on, it's on</i>

27:52.128 --> 27:53.880
<i>It's on</i>

27:54.047 --> 27:56.966
<i>Show me, show me, show me, show me
Show what you got</i>

27:57.050 --> 27:59.094
<i>Come on, come on, come on, come on

<i>Ready or not</i>

<i>La, la, la, la, let me see how you bob
It's on, it's on, it's on</i>

28:05.642 --> 28:08.019
<i>Get crazy, crazy, crazy
Take it over the top</i>

28:08.603 --> 28:10.689
<i>- Over the top
-'Cause when we rock, we let it rock</i>

28:11.439 --> 28:14.192
<i>Rock it, rock it, rock it, rock it
Dance till we drop</i>

28:14.192 --> 28:16.236
<i>It's on, it's on, it's on</i>

28:17.237 --> 28:20.949
<i>It's on</i>

28:27.747 --> 28:31.960
America, I am so glad that
the missing camper got rescued

28:32.085 --> 28:35.255
'cause he just caused
the Yellow Team to win Color War!

28:45.390 --> 28:46.683
Whoo!

28:50.895 --> 28:54.399
Hey. Don't tell anyone,
but today wasn't the worst.

28:56.401 --> 28:57.986
Quite the turnaround, Jet.

28:58.236 --> 29:00.488
We did it together, Maddie.
We got the win.

29:01.865 --> 29:03.700
Yeah. Yeah, we did.

29:07.912 --> 29:10.957
He's a very committed young man, huh?

29:10.957 --> 29:14.419
Yeah. Yeah.
I'm not sure exactly what changed.

29:15.295 --> 29:17.213
Maybe he just wants to show you he cares?

29:20.508 --> 29:24.512
Ricky, I think I see what you're
trying to do and I appreciate it.

29:25.513 --> 29:27.390
But we've had good days before and...

29:28.975 --> 29:32.395
I just don't wanna let my guard down
and get hurt again, you know?

29:37.108 --> 29:38.193
- We lost.

29:38.318 --> 29:43.156
Good job. Mr. Bleu, can we do
the Wildcat cheer? Please?

29:43.782 --> 29:47.494
Listen, Carla, I'm grateful for
my time in the HSMCU.

29:49.746 --> 29:51.748
It's the <i>High School Musical</i>
Cinematic Universe.

29:52.165 --> 29:56.211
But those days are in the past.
You understand?

29:56.211 --> 29:57.670
- Mmm-hmm.
- Yeah.

30:02.217 --> 30:05.178
Hey, if it helps, I'm happy to do
the Wildcat cheer night or day.

30:05.303 --> 30:07.639
I have no shame. I'm shameless.

30:08.807 --> 30:11.142
Actually, I could use
your help with something.

30:14.646 --> 30:15.980
Okay, keep going.

30:18.024 --> 30:19.442
This better be good, Bowen.

30:22.362 --> 30:23.696
And...

30:25.740 --> 30:26.950
There's room for one more.

30:30.578 --> 30:31.788
I think she means you, dude.

30:38.503 --> 30:39.587
Tight squeeze.

30:45.176 --> 30:46.261
Okay. Think I'm gonna go.

30:46.386 --> 30:50.974
Wait. Ricky, thanks for helping with this.
You're the best.

30:58.064 --> 30:59.107
So, what's all this?

31:01.401 --> 31:05.572
So, I was kind of hoping
we'd spend the whole day together.

31:05.572 --> 31:06.865
I know.

31:06.990 --> 31:13.329
And I was kind of hoping we'd have
a win after that very weird rehearsal.

31:13.997 --> 31:15.081
Gina, I know.

31:15.498 --> 31:22.130
But I learned how to throw a ball today,
so I'm gonna go for a Hail Mary here.

31:23.506 --> 31:27.468
EJ, will you be my date to the camp prom?

31:28.595 --> 31:32.140
- Wait. That's what this is?
- That's what this is.

31:32.140 --> 31:34.809
- Oh, man.

31:36.102 --> 31:40.023
I really wish I could,
but there's a rule.

31:40.940 --> 31:42.692
No dates allowed to the prom.

31:43.359 --> 31:47.030
It's a Shallow Lake tradition
so nobody's feelings can get hurt.

31:48.907 --> 31:50.241
Oh.

31:51.534 --> 31:54.287
Well, that is very progressive, of course.

31:55.204 --> 31:56.205
Yeah.

31:58.875 --> 32:02.045
But hey, look, maybe we could
just sit here and you know,

32:02.211 --> 32:04.088
paddle away till the fireworks go off.

32:04.339 --> 32:06.883
I have a few minutes
before I have to get back to work.

32:07.634 --> 32:11.429
The fireworks, is that a metaphor, or...

32:11.596 --> 32:15.808
No. Yeah, there's real fireworks coming.
It's a Color War tradition.

32:22.190 --> 32:23.316
Any minute now.

32:31.866 --> 32:34.327
CAMPER 1: It was pretty great, though.
CAMPER 2: It was.

32:38.164 --> 32:42.752
Um, Ashlyn, that is so nice of you,
but you really don't have to do that.

32:43.002 --> 32:46.547
Val, I'm so sorry. I don't know why
I keep snapping at you.

32:46.881 --> 32:49.384
I don't snap at anyone.
Not that I'm perfect.

32:49.676 --> 32:51.678
I'm far from perfect.

32:52.595 --> 32:55.890
I forget to use coasters, I only tip 20%,

32:55.974 --> 32:58.977
and I didn't learn the Hebrew for
my Torah portion at my bat mitzvah.

32:59.894 --> 33:03.064
But you have been nothing
but nice to me, okay?

33:03.064 --> 33:05.316
Why on earth would I snap at you?

33:24.127 --> 33:25.586
Oh.

33:26.379 --> 33:27.422
That's why.

33:45.440 --> 33:48.985
- Are you okay?
- Me? Yeah.

33:49.402 --> 33:50.528
My, uh...

33:51.988 --> 33:56.451
My dad got me a moon rock, so I could walk
on the moon before my 18th birthday.

33:57.952 --> 34:00.079
I may actually make it
through my bucket list.

34:01.414 --> 34:03.332
- And that's why you're crying?
- No.

34:03.791 --> 34:05.334
Uh... Um...

34:07.086 --> 34:11.591
I just can't believe
I let Color War slip through my fingers.

34:13.760 --> 34:16.262
- You mean Gina.
- Okay, stop.

34:17.388 --> 34:20.433
You're the one who went on a mission
all day to fix an actual mistake.

34:21.059 --> 34:23.019
And I was pretty nice
about it the whole time.

34:23.436 --> 34:26.522
I do appreciate it.

34:27.857 --> 34:31.652
- You've been pretty decent all summer.
- Thank you. You're a nightmare.

34:34.322 --> 34:37.283
I am not looking forward to prom.

34:39.243 --> 34:43.956
You know, my sister and Madison
broke up at this dance last year.

34:45.374 --> 34:47.335
I always felt it was my fault somehow.

34:53.341 --> 34:57.220
- Okay, what is that face?
- You just gave me a big idea.
