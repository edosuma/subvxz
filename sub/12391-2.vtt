00:21.180 --> 00:22.511
Where's your project, Shawn?

00:22.550 --> 00:23.778
Did you even do it?

00:23.820 --> 00:25.139
My project?
Of course I did it.

00:25.190 --> 00:26.452
Uh-huh.
VVhen?

00:26.490 --> 00:28.458
VVhen?
Last night.

00:28.490 --> 00:29.752
It's right here.

00:29.790 --> 00:31.280
This head
is to exact scale.

00:31.330 --> 00:33.298
It took me three months
to make it.

00:33.330 --> 00:36.128
Yours took five minutes.

00:36.170 --> 00:37.819
No, Gus,
you're totally wrong.

00:37.870 --> 00:40.259
It took me a whole hour.

00:40.300 --> 00:41.699

That's seven in row.

(Lassiter)
Oh, I wouldn't
call myself a hero.

01:27.750 --> 01:29.718
I'm just doing my job
just like all of you.

01:29.750 --> 01:30.887
Hey, that's enough
goofing off.

01:30.920 --> 01:32.456
Let's get back
to work, huh?

01:32.490 --> 01:33.718
You too.

01:33.760 --> 01:36.285
Ladies and gentlemen,

Oh, stop it!

01:41.730 --> 01:43.322

Shawn.

01:43.370 --> 01:45.429
Is there a problem?

01:45.470 --> 01:47.233
With what?
With you.

01:47.270 --> 01:49.204
With me.
With the Chief.

01:49.240 --> 01:50.264
She hasn't called
in a month.

01:50.310 --> 01:52.801
Is she still mad about me
requisitioning the Segway?

01:52.840 --> 01:54.171
You did that?

01:54.210 --> 01:56.747
No.

01:56.780 --> 01:59.669
Well, I don't really
have time right now,

01:59.720 --> 02:01.574
but the short answer is

02:01.620 --> 02:04.214
we just haven't really needed
any outside help.

02:04.250 --> 02:05.740
Well, what's
the long answer?

02:05.790 --> 02:07.189
I mean,
throw a "but" in there

02:07.220 --> 02:08.710
and add something
about a dream

02:10.630 --> 02:13.224
Detective Lassiter
IS literally on fire.

02:13.260 --> 02:14.488
What kind of fire
are we talking about?

02:14.530 --> 02:16.168
Michael Jackson
in the Pepsi commercial fire

02:16.200 --> 02:18.191
or misusing the word
"literally" fire?

02:18.230 --> 02:21.199
He's solved eight cases
in a row fire.

02:21.240 --> 02:24.164
Nine--I just remembered
the DeShano case.

02:24.210 --> 02:26.337
Hey, Shawn.
What's new?

02:26.380 --> 02:28.371
You still doing
the psychic thing?

02:28.410 --> 02:31.243
Is this_ some sort of
weird dream?

02:31.280 --> 02:32.247
On the last two cases,

02:32.280 --> 02:35.249
the first suspect
Lassiter questioned confessed.

02:35.280 --> 02:36.178
It's really magnificent.

02:36.220 --> 02:39.257
We are talking about
Carlton Lassiter, right?

02:43.860 --> 02:47.296
Spencer,
long time, no see.

02:47.330 --> 02:50.299
Or is that no need?

02:50.330 --> 02:51.319
I can't believe this.

02:51.370 --> 02:53.588
Oh, believe it.
It's real.

02:53.640 --> 02:54.766
(McNab)
They've done
a preliminary

02:54.800 --> 02:56.404
on the body down
at the marina, Detective.

02:56.440 --> 02:58.328
They're ready for you
at the scene.

02:58.370 --> 03:00.804
Well, I would love
to stay and chat,

03:00.840 --> 03:02.444
but duty does call.

03:02.480 --> 03:06.246
Oh, Spencer,
you look so sad.

03:06.280 --> 03:10.216
Come on, we'll show you
how real cops do it.

03:10.250 --> 03:13.310
No comeback?

03:13.360 --> 03:16.227
Shawn, that's
slightly embarrassing.

03:31.270 --> 03:33.409
Good luck with this one,
Detective.

03:33.440 --> 03:34.839
There's no identification.

03:38.010 --> 03:38.977
Nobody's been
reported missing

03:41.020 --> 03:42.544
Oh, Mr. Spencer.

03:42.590 --> 03:44.546
I'm surprised
you didn't take the Segway.

03:44.590 --> 03:46.558
She did know
about that.

03:46.590 --> 03:47.989
O'Hara just told me.

03:48.020 --> 03:49.487

03:49.530 --> 03:51.885
I'll deal with you later.

03:55.030 --> 03:57.396
So what's the new
case we've got?

03:57.430 --> 03:59.364
A slight error
in grammar there, buddy.

03:59.400 --> 04:00.697
Which part?
"Got. ll

04:00.740 --> 04:03.334

from the office, Shawn.

04:03.370 --> 04:05.338

a giant snapping turtle.

We'll have a case
in five minutes.

04:15.020 --> 04:17.545
Nobody can explain
these puncture wounds.

04:17.590 --> 04:19.683
We can't rule out
an animal attack.

04:22.490 --> 04:23.923
No...no, there's nothing
in these waters

04:23.960 --> 04:25.427
with a bite radius
that large.

04:25.460 --> 04:29.328
No, this is maybe
a...boating accident.

04:29.370 --> 04:31.930
The wounds caused by
some machinery.

04:31.970 --> 04:34.336
I can't really be sure
at this juncture.

04:34.370 --> 04:37.430
Completely stumped.
Hmm.

04:37.470 --> 04:39.404
You getting something,
Mr. Spencer?

04:41.410 --> 04:42.809
Yes.

04:43.810 --> 04:46.916
Yes, I am.

04:49.420 --> 04:50.910
No,no,no!
No, hold on.

04:50.950 --> 04:52.087
Okay, I've got it.

04:52.120 --> 04:52.882
The wound on the head

04:52.920 --> 04:55.855
was caused by the edge
of a boat

04:55.890 --> 04:58.324
when he fell in_ the water
unconSCIous.

04:58.360 --> 04:59.896
And the wounds
on the back,

04:59.930 --> 05:01.420
they were caused by a large

05:01.460 --> 05:03.462
industrial crab trap.

05:04.830 --> 05:05.922
Unh!

05:05.970 --> 05:07.062
Or a whale.

05:07.100 --> 05:08.362
It definitely
could've been a whale.

05:08.400 --> 05:10.402
Lost from his pod.

05:10.440 --> 05:13.329
Separated,
migrating north or south.

05:15.580 --> 05:17.070
already floating up
above the surface.

05:17.110 --> 05:20.443
Thinks it's a seal
and then--whale.

05:20.480 --> 05:23.415

Or--
Detective,
if you don't mind,

05:28.620 --> 05:30.383
I'd like to see what
Mr. Spencer has to offer.

05:30.430 --> 05:31.419
[blowing on paper]

05:33.000 --> 05:34.729
All right, look,
this is gonna be

05:34.760 --> 05:36.091
a little rough, okay?

05:36.130 --> 05:37.620

for shading.

05:39.130 --> 05:40.529

had my druthers,

05:40.570 --> 05:41.594
I would've done it
in charcoal.

05:41.640 --> 05:43.460
You know what
I'm talking about.

05:43.510 --> 05:44.568
Look, what I'm trying
to say is,

05:44.610 --> 05:45.634
I'm not the artist
I'd like to be--

05:45.670 --> 05:46.898
Okay, Mr. Spencer, enough.

05:46.940 --> 05:48.407
Can you or can you not
tell us who's responsible

05:48.440 --> 05:49.475
for this man's death?

05:49.510 --> 05:52.104
If I can present you
with a semi-accurate sketch

05:52.150 --> 05:54.448
of the culprit, is that enough
to get us on this case?

05:54.480 --> 05:56.448
Yes.

05:56.490 --> 05:58.378
All right.

05:58.420 --> 05:59.409
The puncture wounds.

05:59.460 --> 06:00.586
They're the key.

06:00.620 --> 06:02.520
Giving me the impression
that this crime

06:02.560 --> 06:03.720
could only
have been committed...

I love looking
like an idiot.

07:08.890 --> 07:10.027
Well, that explains
your shoes.

07:10.060 --> 07:11.857
You almost closed down
our agency

07:11.890 --> 07:13.096
with that little act
of yours, Shawn.

07:13.130 --> 07:14.097

07:21.970 --> 07:23.506
Gus, you're panicking.
Don't panic.

07:23.540 --> 07:24.859
Those bite_ marks
are con5istent

07:24.910 --> 07:25.968
with a tyrannosaurus bite.

07:26.010 --> 07:27.102
You know that.

07:27.140 --> 07:30.109
Yes, I know that.
The hard way.

07:30.150 --> 07:32.971
I was canned from the Wyoming
Natural History Museum

07:33.020 --> 07:34.612
for that little shot.

07:34.650 --> 07:36.584
The bruises from the teeth
didn't go away for a year,

07:36.620 --> 07:37.780
but totally worth it.

07:37.820 --> 07:39.242
It was my best
screensaver ever.

07:39.290 --> 07:42.521
Gus, please, connecting
a dinosaur to this case

07:42.560 --> 07:44.027
is the least
of our worries.

07:44.060 --> 07:45.550
Look, I can I stash
a toy dinosaur

07:45.590 --> 07:46.818
in the window
of the killer.

07:46.860 --> 07:48.589
I can link him to a box
of Dino Bites

07:48.630 --> 07:49.426
or Fruity Pebbles.

07:49.460 --> 07:52.634
I can play
Six Degrees of Dinosaur

07:52.670 --> 07:55.639

07:57.310 --> 07:59.164
You've never been in a movie

07:59.210 --> 08:00.131

have you?

08:00.180 --> 08:03.900
How about you play
Six Degrees of Kiss My Ass?

08:03.950 --> 08:04.848
First of all,

08:04.880 --> 08:07.212
that sounds like
a totally disturbing game.

08:07.250 --> 08:08.877
What's weird is that my guess
on the jaw radius

08:08.920 --> 08:11.616
was actually spot on.

08:11.650 --> 08:14.084
It almost seems
to make sense.

08:14.120 --> 08:16.281
So now you're getting on board
with your own joke theory?

08:16.320 --> 08:18.550
How are you gonna match
your bite radius

08:18.590 --> 08:20.126
to the victim, Shawn?

08:20.160 --> 08:22.560
Drag the body
to the Wyoming museum?

08:22.600 --> 08:24.568
[Gus chuckles]

08:24.600 --> 08:26.636
I can do you one better.

08:26.670 --> 08:27.796
What?

08:27.840 --> 08:30.104
I need to borrow
my dad's truck.

08:30.140 --> 08:33.974
You coming or what?

08:34.010 --> 08:35.238
That's clearly a no.

08:35.280 --> 08:37.578
(coroner)
The one thing
we can be sure of is

08:37.610 --> 08:40.078
the cause of death
was not drowning.

08:40.120 --> 08:42.645
Blunt force trauma
to the head was severe enough

08:42.690 --> 08:43.987
to knock him unconscious.

08:44.020 --> 08:47.114
More than likely he fell
from some sort of

08:47.160 --> 08:49.685
a platform after
knocking himself on the head.

08:49.730 --> 08:51.652
And this is how he ended up
in the water?

08:51.690 --> 08:53.624
(coroner)
No, he landed
on something hard.

08:53.660 --> 08:56.026
Dislocated a rib.

08:56.060 --> 08:57.561
He has bruis_es consistent
With a SIX, seven,

08:57.600 --> 08:58.567
or eight-foot fall.

08:58.600 --> 09:00.989
My guess is that he landed
on something else

09:01.040 --> 09:04.862
and ultimately expired
before tumbling into the water.

09:04.910 --> 09:06.730
You know,
this might be a leap,

09:06.780 --> 09:08.202
but I would check
the offshore oil rigs.

09:08.240 --> 09:10.071
See if any of them
are missing workers.

09:10.110 --> 09:12.578
I'll make some calls.

09:12.620 --> 09:14.178
(Vick)
Interesting, Detective.

09:14.220 --> 09:15.710
Thanks, Chief.

09:15.750 --> 09:16.819
This theory feels good.
Just makes sense.

09:16.850 --> 09:19.751
The work boots, the odd
configuration of the wounds.

09:19.790 --> 09:21.781
You know us, Ted.
It's worth a shot, right?

09:21.820 --> 09:22.855
We don't go out
on limbs too often...

09:22.890 --> 09:23.879
(Shawn)
Thanks, guys.

09:23.930 --> 09:26.023
I just need
to measure something.

09:26.060 --> 09:28.051
Oh, good!

09:28.100 --> 09:29.249
You're all here.

09:29.300 --> 09:31.029
Get ready to be shocked.

09:31.070 --> 09:33.368
Can we get the sheet
off the dead guy, please?

09:33.400 --> 09:35.231
Confirming the bite radius...

09:35.270 --> 09:37.329
No!
Mr. Spencer--

09:37.370 --> 09:39.065
Whoa, hey, hey, be careful.
This isn't mine.

09:39.110 --> 09:41.908
Mr. Spencer, your antics
have always been a little--

09:41.940 --> 09:43.669
let's say unorthodox.

09:43.710 --> 09:45.769
But let me be as frank
as I can be

09:45.810 --> 09:48.040
With my assessment
of your most recent behavior.

09:48.080 --> 09:49.377
Seek help.

09:49.420 --> 09:52.958
Chief, sometimes
you have to jump off a cliff.

09:52.990 --> 09:54.218
You have to close your eyes.

09:54.260 --> 09:57.752
You have to unhook
your clip "chasses"--

09:57.790 --> 09:58.722
Chassis?

10:01.830 --> 10:03.263
Climbing thing...

10:03.300 --> 10:05.291
and you have to leap.

10:05.330 --> 10:08.697
Now I ask you, Chief...
Will you leap with me?

10:08.740 --> 10:11.868
Are you thinking about
jumping off a cliff?

10:11.910 --> 10:14.105
Maybe.

10:24.850 --> 10:26.147
Yo!

10:26.190 --> 10:27.817
Dad!

10:27.860 --> 10:30.328
I've brought the keys back.
Hello!

10:32.830 --> 10:36.049
Okay, this is creepy.
Why is Gus here?

10:36.100 --> 10:37.294
Why do you think, Shawn?

10:37.330 --> 10:39.730
He's a hostage.
Tsk!

10:39.770 --> 10:41.829
Perhaps I can shed
some light on that.

10:41.870 --> 10:43.337
Two hostages.

10:43.370 --> 10:45.406
Doug Devette is
an old colleague of mine

10:45.440 --> 10:46.805
from the force.

10:46.840 --> 10:49.172
The Chief asked me
to have him drop by.

10:49.210 --> 10:51.349
Why?

10:51.380 --> 10:54.213
Doug is the department
psychologist, Shawn.

10:54.250 --> 10:55.672
What is this, some sort
of intervention?

10:55.720 --> 10:57.085
Yeah, sort of.

10:57.120 --> 10:59.714
We don't like to use the term
"intervention," Shawn.

10:59.760 --> 11:01.318
Gus?

11:01.360 --> 11:03.681
Don't look at me.
I'm here for the cupcakes.

11:03.730 --> 11:06.187
Dad, I am not on drugs.

11:06.230 --> 11:08.152
Oh, nobody thinks
that, Shawn.

11:08.200 --> 11:09.724
Well, I'm not completely
sure about that, Doug.

11:09.770 --> 11:10.862
We're all just
a little concerned

11:10.900 --> 11:11.719
that you might be

11:11.770 --> 11:13.829
stretching yourself
a bit too thin.

11:13.870 --> 11:14.996
It wasn't my idea,
but he's right, Shawn.

11:15.040 --> 11:16.837
You're acting
like a nut job.

11:16.870 --> 11:19.805
Just because I take
Gus' giant dinosaur head

11:19.840 --> 11:21.979
down to a dead body
does not make me a nut job.

11:22.010 --> 11:24.240
What?

11:24.280 --> 11:26.077
You took my T-Rex?

11:26.110 --> 11:27.213
My mom gave it to you?

11:27.250 --> 11:28.148
Gladly.

11:28.180 --> 11:29.784
She also gave me
some pictures you can pay me

11:29.820 --> 11:31.014
to not show
your next girlfriend.

11:31.050 --> 11:32.039
What pictures?

11:32.090 --> 11:33.159
The ones that document

11:35.760 --> 11:37.227
Whatever, Shawn.

11:37.260 --> 11:38.750
You took Danny Dino
to the police station?

11:38.790 --> 11:41.759
No, Gus, give me
some credit.

11:41.800 --> 11:43.859
I took him to the morgue.

11:43.900 --> 11:45.128
Good news.

11:45.170 --> 11:48.867
Your specifications
were spot on.

11:48.900 --> 11:51.801
Your father tells_ me
you have delusmns

11:51.840 --> 11:52.932
of magical powers.

11:52.980 --> 11:56.336
Delusions?
Really.

11:56.380 --> 11:59.440
Doug, I'm employed
as a psychic.

11:59.480 --> 12:01.118
I've solved
18 cases this year.

12:01.150 --> 12:03.880
I have business cards
and a personalized coffee mug

12:03.920 --> 12:06.309
that backs up
the Whole thing.

12:06.350 --> 12:09.012
I feel things
about people.

12:11.560 --> 12:14.529
You, for instance,
are color blind.

12:14.560 --> 12:16.994
That's nothing
to be ashamed off.

12:19.530 --> 12:22.431
You're also really stressed
about something.

12:28.840 --> 12:30.808
College.

12:30.850 --> 12:32.499
It can_ be
very expenswe, Doug.

12:32.550 --> 12:34.279
Oh, wow,
that was good, Henry.

12:34.320 --> 12:35.912
Doug, do not be a stooge.

12:35.950 --> 12:40.011
Not a stooge, but in this
one case, he was right.

12:40.060 --> 12:41.982
Knock at door.

12:42.020 --> 12:43.328
[knocking on door]

12:43.360 --> 12:44.827
Karen, do you mind?

12:44.860 --> 12:46.088
We're in the middle
of an intervention here.

12:46.130 --> 12:47.324
(Vick)
We don't have time for that.

12:47.360 --> 12:48.918
But you're the one
Who asked for this.

12:48.960 --> 12:49.790
And I thank you, Henry,

12:49.830 --> 12:51.058
but I'm afraid
that this can't wait.

12:51.100 --> 12:52.362
We just got a break
in the case.

12:52.400 --> 12:54.095
We just found out
the name of the dead man.

12:54.140 --> 12:55.960
You want to tell him
Who he is, Detective?

12:56.000 --> 12:58.833
No.

12:58.870 --> 13:02.374
His name was
Christopher Franzen.

13:02.410 --> 13:04.878
He is a paleontologist.

13:07.520 --> 13:09.010
A dinosaur hunter.

13:09.050 --> 13:12.110
As expected.

13:12.150 --> 13:13.879
Doug...

13:13.920 --> 13:15.217
pleasure was all mine.

13:15.260 --> 13:16.818
Oh, no, Shawn, mine.

13:16.860 --> 13:22.867
We should get together.

13:22.900 --> 13:24.026
(Gus)
All right, here's
What we know so far.

13:24.070 --> 13:26.061
A man,
a paleontology professor,

13:26.100 --> 13:28.295
washes _a_shore W_ith wounds
speCIfic to a dinosaur.

13:28.340 --> 13:30.035
I don't think we can
rule out the possibility

13:30.070 --> 13:31.833
of island
somewhere in the Pacific

13:31.870 --> 13:33.098
Where dinosaurs do exist.

13:33.140 --> 13:35.108
And have an appetite
for Jeff Goldblum.

13:35.140 --> 13:36.107
I'm being serious, Shawn.

13:36.140 --> 13:38.108
Well, look
Who's Mr. Onboard

13:38.150 --> 13:39.606
and sounding like
a whacked wombat.

13:39.650 --> 13:41.572
Then what is it?
I don't know.

13:41.620 --> 13:44.088
It actually scares me
that my Wild dinosaur reach

13:44.120 --> 13:46.145
landed so close
to the bull's-eye.

13:46.190 --> 13:48.954
This guy was possibly killed
by something dinosaur-related,

13:48.990 --> 13:50.218
but it was probably a model

13:50.260 --> 13:52.125
or something from
the archaeology department.

13:52.160 --> 13:53.491
We'll have to spend
the better part

13:53.530 --> 13:55.088
of the next 24 hours
sifting through

13:55.130 --> 13:56.995
their entire collection
of artifacts.

13:57.030 --> 13:58.463
And by "we" I mean
mostly you.

14:05.110 --> 14:06.998
This is all there is?

14:07.040 --> 14:08.337
No.
No, no, no.

14:08.380 --> 14:10.007
This is just
the big stuff.

14:10.050 --> 14:12.075
We got the trilobites
in a shoebox,

14:12.110 --> 14:13.577
but the shelf
is kind of high.

14:13.620 --> 14:16.111
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:16.150 --> 14:17.981
You've got Pinhead, Chatterbox,
Surgeon, and Stitch

14:18.020 --> 14:19.146
up there on a shelf?

14:19.190 --> 14:21.112
Shawn, those are Cenobites.

14:21.160 --> 14:22.149
Oh.
Well, What are trilobites?

14:22.190 --> 14:24.158
Fish fossils.

14:24.190 --> 14:26.021
Oh, Gus, for my sake,

14:26.060 --> 14:27.254
at least pretend like
you don't know this stuff

14:27.300 --> 14:28.619
off the top of your head.

14:28.660 --> 14:31.163
Do this move.

14:31.200 --> 14:33.964
Trilo--trilobite?
What--it'll help you!

14:34.000 --> 14:35.069
I'm serious.

14:35.100 --> 14:36.590
Look, Ethan,
I can honestly say

14:36.640 --> 14:38.232
_ there were_more_
historically Significant items

14:38.270 --> 14:39.498
in the lost and found

14:39.540 --> 14:41.076
at the Taco John's
in Porterville.

14:41.110 --> 14:42.134
Yeah.

14:42.180 --> 14:43.647
[chuckles]

14:43.680 --> 14:45.443
Yeah, it's a little sad.

14:45.480 --> 14:48.472
Word is the Whole program
is going under.

14:48.520 --> 14:50.249
You sure about that?

14:50.290 --> 14:52.508
Look, Professor Franzen
would never really give us

14:52.550 --> 14:53.585
a straight answer.

14:53.620 --> 14:55.110
In fact, most nights

14:55.160 --> 14:56.252
he wasn't around to give us
any answers.

14:56.290 --> 14:58.349
He was a pretty crappy
advisor.

14:58.390 --> 15:00.494
And when he did show up,
he was late, tired,

15:00.530 --> 15:02.157
completely disheveled.

15:02.200 --> 15:04.088
Nobody really trusted the guy.

15:04.130 --> 15:06.121
Look, do not ever take
a class from him.

15:06.170 --> 15:07.194
He's dead.

15:07.240 --> 15:10.004
Oh, yeah.
Then totally.

15:16.140 --> 15:18.472
Well, this sure was
a dead end.

15:18.510 --> 15:20.216
Yep, but at least we were
the first ones

15:20.250 --> 15:22.047
to find the dead end.

15:22.080 --> 15:24.219
Oh, come on!

15:24.250 --> 15:28.186
He really is on fire.
Literally.

15:32.290 --> 15:33.120
(Gus)
I don't get this.

15:33.160 --> 15:35.299
The cops beat us
to the dead guy's house.

15:35.330 --> 15:37.264
I don't know how I feel
about the police department

15:37.300 --> 15:38.460
being so proactive.

15:38.500 --> 15:40.058
Feeling the heat?

15:40.100 --> 15:41.692
What, do you think I'm afraid
of a little competition?

15:41.740 --> 15:43.605
I know you're afraid
of competition.

15:43.640 --> 15:45.232
Why else would you have
purposefully broken

15:45.270 --> 15:46.464
the Battlezone
at Pizza Royale?

15:46.510 --> 15:48.068
Dude, you beat me once.

15:48.110 --> 15:49.509
And only because you first
used the eyepiece

15:49.540 --> 15:51.349
and then revealed
you had pinkeye.
Eh.

15:58.290 --> 16:00.588
Let's venture off
the beaten path.

16:08.260 --> 16:09.329
What's wrong?

16:09.360 --> 16:10.759
I'm just trying
to figure out

16:10.800 --> 16:12.358
What to do here,
since as a rule

16:12.400 --> 16:13.264
we don't
break and enter.

16:13.300 --> 16:15.188
What do you mean
we don't break and enter?

16:15.240 --> 16:17.606
The 2400 Motel.
The Hotel de la Cruz.

16:17.640 --> 16:19.130
The spellmaster's box.

16:19.170 --> 16:21.673
Yeah, but we really
shouldn't pick this lock.

16:21.710 --> 16:23.177
You know I want
to pick that lock.

16:23.210 --> 16:24.177
Yes, I do.

16:24.210 --> 16:25.700
Watch out.

16:29.380 --> 16:31.280
[breathing deeply]

16:31.320 --> 16:32.719
What are you,
the lock Whisperer?

16:32.750 --> 16:35.150
[high-pitched grunting]
[tumbler clicks]

16:35.190 --> 16:37.624
Are you channeling
Michael Jackson?
Shh!

16:37.660 --> 16:39.423
[tumbler clicks]
Who heard the second click?

16:39.460 --> 16:40.620
I heard the second click.

16:40.660 --> 16:43.493
[lock beeps]

16:43.530 --> 16:45.066
[gears whirring]

16:45.100 --> 16:47.091
Really?

16:51.140 --> 16:52.607
Come on.

16:58.410 --> 16:59.638
I can't see anything.

16:59.680 --> 17:01.238
Oh, I got it,
I got it.

17:04.290 --> 17:05.109
Aah!

17:05.150 --> 17:06.788
Gus, that thing is
brighter than the sun.

17:06.820 --> 17:08.253
Think you just
gave me glaucoma.

17:08.290 --> 17:09.689
You can't give someone
glaucoma.

17:12.390 --> 17:14.699
Thank you.

17:14.730 --> 17:16.357
Wow.

17:16.400 --> 17:18.391
This is better than the entire
univerSIty department.

17:18.430 --> 17:20.239
It sure is.

17:20.270 --> 17:23.103
And his digging equipment
is some heavy duty stuff.

17:23.140 --> 17:25.267
Looks like some shovels
are missmg.

17:26.670 --> 17:29.104
Part of a portable
light kit.

17:29.140 --> 17:32.268
A lot of brushes.

17:35.320 --> 17:36.617
And fine finishing equipment,

17:36.650 --> 17:39.710
which I would assume
he was only using in the lab.

17:42.420 --> 17:44.524
Dude, I got something.
What?

17:44.560 --> 17:46.357
He was the worst
tic-tac-toe player

17:46.390 --> 17:47.220
in the history of the world.

17:47.260 --> 17:48.295
I'm investigating

17:48.330 --> 17:50.298
and you're analyzing
his doodles?

17:50.330 --> 17:52.423
Doodles are the window
to the soul, Gus.

17:52.470 --> 17:54.791
Or maybe
that's the epiglottis.

17:54.840 --> 17:57.263
Where's the uvula?

17:57.310 --> 17:58.402
Lassiter's here.

17:58.440 --> 18:00.874
That guy's like
five minutes behind us

18:00.910 --> 18:02.434
everywhere we go.

18:02.480 --> 18:05.176
Don't sleep
in the nude tonight.

18:05.210 --> 18:06.404
[garage door closes]

18:15.790 --> 18:17.724
Spencen

18:17.760 --> 18:19.284
Enjoying your time
riding my behind?

18:19.330 --> 18:20.752
Definitely
not in the nude.

18:20.800 --> 18:22.222
This lock looks
too high tech

18:22.260 --> 18:23.227
for a backyard shed.

18:23.270 --> 18:24.669
We gotta find somebody
Who can crack the code.

18:24.700 --> 18:27.498
There's already someone
here who can do that.

18:27.540 --> 18:30.168
That person...is me.

18:30.210 --> 18:33.873
Well, make yourself useful.

18:33.910 --> 18:36.629
I'll need you
to step back, please.

18:36.680 --> 18:38.272
Give me some room
to operate.

18:38.310 --> 18:41.347
[rubbing hands together]

18:41.380 --> 18:42.472
Further, please.

18:44.420 --> 18:45.444
Further.

18:45.490 --> 18:46.582
Jules, could you
help me out here?

18:46.620 --> 18:48.611
Just get him back
onto the cobblestone.

18:48.660 --> 18:51.686
That's good,
that's good.

18:51.730 --> 18:52.924
Thank you.

18:52.960 --> 18:54.222
Ahem.

18:54.260 --> 18:55.591
[exhales]

18:55.630 --> 18:58.497
I am sensing
the first two digits.

18:58.530 --> 19:00.395
[exhales]

19:00.440 --> 19:01.464
[whispering]
What is it, 31?

19:01.500 --> 19:02.797
Pfft!

19:02.840 --> 19:04.705
Gus, help me out here.
Come on, buddy.

19:04.740 --> 19:07.402
You can have
my Tony Gwynn rookie.
25.

19:07.440 --> 19:10.307
25!

19:12.710 --> 19:13.677
Eight?

19:13.720 --> 19:14.948
Three.

19:14.980 --> 19:17.778
Three!

19:17.820 --> 19:19.788
[whispering]
Four?
Two.

19:19.820 --> 19:22.414
And...two.

19:22.460 --> 19:23.779
There's one more.

19:23.830 --> 19:25.786
Wait!

19:25.830 --> 19:26.888
There's one more.

19:26.930 --> 19:28.795
Nine.

19:30.700 --> 19:31.667
[chuckling]

19:31.700 --> 19:33.861
[gears whirring]

19:33.900 --> 19:36.164
[prolonged inhale]

19:41.310 --> 19:43.449
That was amazing.

19:43.480 --> 19:45.675
I'll give you that one.

19:49.250 --> 19:50.387
Can't see a thing
in here.

19:50.420 --> 19:51.489
Oh, I've got it.

19:51.520 --> 19:53.579
Wait, I'm sensing
a light switch.

19:55.460 --> 19:57.382
Tools are missing.

19:57.430 --> 20:00.729
Good work, Detective.

20:00.760 --> 20:02.318
He had a blunt force
trauma.

20:02.360 --> 20:04.499
That could be supplied
by one of these missing items.

20:04.530 --> 20:07.397
Maybe this rock hammer
or this medium shovel.

20:07.440 --> 20:09.499
But Where would they be?

20:09.540 --> 20:10.837
The bed of his pickup.

20:10.870 --> 20:14.237
It wasn't parked out front
or at the university.

20:14.280 --> 20:15.702
We find that truck,
we find the murder weapon.

20:15.740 --> 20:16.707
Let's go, O'Hara.

20:16.740 --> 20:19.948
Burning daylight.
Excuse us.

20:22.750 --> 20:24.547
Man, you missed
the truck?

20:24.590 --> 20:26.444
I'm not the psychic.
Ugh.

20:31.790 --> 20:33.826
What?

20:33.860 --> 20:37.318
Why would someone
frequent a fruit stand

20:37.370 --> 20:39.588
that's over 50 miles away?

20:39.630 --> 20:41.495
They like pomegranate?

20:52.480 --> 20:54.448
Yeah, I know him.

20:54.480 --> 20:55.777
He was my best customer.

20:55.820 --> 20:57.549
Don't know his name.

20:57.590 --> 20:59.911
But he comes by
every night before closing.

20:59.950 --> 21:01.656
Did you ever see
which way he went?

21:01.690 --> 21:03.328
Yeah.

21:03.360 --> 21:04.782
Always up the hill.

21:04.830 --> 21:06.525
That's all I see.

21:06.560 --> 21:08.824
Although
every once in a while

21:08.860 --> 21:10.669
I see him come back
down the hill

21:10.700 --> 21:11.724
early in the morning.

21:11.770 --> 21:12.919
Huh.

21:12.970 --> 21:14.289
Well, thank you
very much.

21:14.340 --> 21:15.295
Gus, you got
anything else?

21:15.340 --> 21:18.036
Yes, is that peach pie
in the back?
Yeah.

21:38.630 --> 21:41.599
Another dead end.
Let's turn around.

21:44.100 --> 21:46.921
Whoa.
Hold on a second.

21:56.810 --> 22:00.519
This looks like a place
someone's been sneaking into.

22:03.590 --> 22:06.582
[both grunt]

22:09.460 --> 22:10.984
What is this?

22:11.030 --> 22:13.999
Looks like some kind of farmland
or grazmg plain.

22:14.030 --> 22:15.122
Oh, look at that.

22:15.160 --> 22:17.424
It's like that movie.

22:17.470 --> 22:18.994
_ The one With
Sigourney Weaver.

22:19.030 --> 22:20.566
Aliens?
No.

22:20.600 --> 22:22.465
Alien.
No.

22:22.500 --> 22:23.762
Alien: Resurrection.

22:23.810 --> 22:25.539
Gus, the one with the holes
and Shia LaBeouf.

22:25.570 --> 22:27.674
They had holes
in Shia LaBeouf?

22:27.710 --> 22:30.406
The holes are in the ground,
dude, like that.

22:30.450 --> 22:32.577
And Jon Voight was walking
around all crazy.

22:32.610 --> 22:34.669
Oh, Anaconda.

22:34.720 --> 22:35.914
Yeah, never mind.

22:35.950 --> 22:37.042
Gorillas in the Mist?

22:37.080 --> 22:38.911
Death and the Maiden?
No!

22:38.950 --> 22:41.851
Half Moon Street?
Just let it go.

22:46.690 --> 22:48.521
I'll be damned.

22:48.560 --> 22:49.652
[gunshot]
What?!

22:49.700 --> 22:51.668
Somebody's
shooting at us!

22:51.700 --> 22:53.463
[gunfire]
Aah!

22:53.500 --> 22:54.865
Oh, God!
They're shooting!
We're gonna die!

22:54.900 --> 22:55.992
[both shouting]

22:56.040 --> 22:58.065
Run, Gus!
Gus, run like the Wind!

22:58.110 --> 23:02.706
No--get--get up!

23:02.740 --> 23:04.799
[both panting]

23:04.850 --> 23:06.545
Come on,
get in the car!

23:06.580 --> 23:08.070
Hurry up, Shawn!

23:08.120 --> 23:09.109
[engine rewing]

23:09.150 --> 23:10.617
Start it, start it!

23:10.650 --> 23:12.481
Go, go, go!

23:12.520 --> 23:14.954
Dude, look at the road
While you're driving!

23:14.990 --> 23:16.412
I'm staying down
for safety.

23:16.460 --> 23:17.188
(Shawn)
He was shooting

23:17.220 --> 23:18.118
directly into the air,
Gus.

23:18.160 --> 23:19.980
Bullets go up.
They have to come down.

23:20.030 --> 23:20.792
Do you know What
the trajectory

23:20.830 --> 23:22.058
would have to be
for that to happen?

23:22.100 --> 23:23.795
Don't you dare argue
physics With me.

23:23.830 --> 23:26.594
Not While we're in the process
of almost being killed.

23:28.470 --> 23:31.962
[exciting spy movie music]

23:32.010 --> 23:34.171
*

23:34.210 --> 23:35.609
Didn't you see

23:35.640 --> 23:38.040
the "Trespassers
Will Be Shot" sign?

23:38.080 --> 23:39.741
(Shawn)
Oh, yeah.

23:39.780 --> 23:41.577
It totally said that.

23:41.620 --> 23:43.144
My bad.

23:48.090 --> 23:49.955
Mr. Spencer, if you have
any substantial information

23:49.990 --> 23:51.548
concerning the Christopher
Franzen case,

23:51.590 --> 23:53.023
please get on with it.

23:53.060 --> 23:55.824
[clucks like chicken]
I've got something.

23:55.860 --> 23:57.088
It's a cluck.

23:57.130 --> 23:57.960
A cluck?

23:58.000 --> 24:03.063
BaWk...baaaWk!

24:03.100 --> 24:04.067
Actually there's two.

24:04.110 --> 24:05.236
Two clucks.

24:05.270 --> 24:06.999
A cluck-cluck here.

24:11.880 --> 24:14.974
A baWk-bawk...there.

24:15.020 --> 24:16.749
Here a bawk.
There a--

24:16.780 --> 24:17.747
Cluck?

24:17.790 --> 24:21.089
Everywhere a bawk-baaaWk.

24:21.120 --> 24:22.758
Let me guess.
You have a name.

24:22.790 --> 24:24.223
MacDonald, perhaps?

24:24.260 --> 24:26.558
No.
No, it's a farm.

24:26.590 --> 24:27.852
With an farmer.
An old farmer.

24:27.900 --> 24:30.824
Farmer...Shooty Pants.
That's a nickname.

24:30.870 --> 24:32.861
I don't think that's
his actual handle.

24:32.900 --> 24:34.162
(Lassiter)
I've got it.

24:34.200 --> 24:36.168
Lassiter found
the paleontologist's truck.

24:36.200 --> 24:37.167
You helped.

24:37.200 --> 24:38.167
I did help.
It was his hunch.

24:38.210 --> 24:39.063
It was down
at the old marina.

24:39.110 --> 24:41.032
Ijust had a feeling.

24:41.080 --> 24:42.775
I also found the prints
of a certain grad student

24:42.810 --> 24:44.778
named Ethan Robinson
along with a stack of letters

24:44.810 --> 24:46.846
from said grad students
demanding the professor

24:46.880 --> 24:48.142
stop ruining his life.

24:48.180 --> 24:50.648
We're sending a car over
to pick him up.

24:50.690 --> 24:53.614
Oh, I'm sorry.
Am I interrupting your trance?

24:53.660 --> 24:54.957
I don't buy it.

24:54.990 --> 24:55.957
Which part?

24:55.990 --> 24:57.582
The damning evidence

24:57.630 --> 24:59.086
or the murder weapon?

24:59.130 --> 25:01.189
There's more going on
in this guy's life.

25:01.230 --> 25:02.049
Chief, I'm sensing...

25:06.300 --> 25:07.892
digging.

25:07.940 --> 25:09.692
Yeah, the archaeology
department was going under.

25:09.740 --> 25:10.934
He was trying to make
a big discovery.

25:10.970 --> 25:12.699
Put him on the map,
get more funding.

25:12.740 --> 25:14.833
The farm.

25:14.880 --> 25:16.074
I can see the name
of the farm.

25:16.110 --> 25:18.078
It's Wallll...

25:18.110 --> 25:21.113
Wallll...

25:21.150 --> 25:22.117
Walker Farms.

25:22.150 --> 25:23.242
Yeah, we got that lead

25:23.280 --> 25:26.215
off the phone records...
yesterday.

25:26.250 --> 25:27.786
Apparently our victim
made a series of phone calls

25:27.820 --> 25:29.082
to the farmer trying to buy
some of his land,

25:29.120 --> 25:30.621
but it wasn't for sale.

25:30.660 --> 25:32.855
Farmer was forthcoming,
cooperative.

25:32.890 --> 25:34.118
Definitely not a suspect.

25:34.160 --> 25:35.058
Anything else?

25:35.100 --> 25:36.795
(Vick)
I have to say,

25:36.830 --> 25:38.127
you have been
very thorough.

25:38.170 --> 25:40.798
We're just doing
What any good cops would do.

25:42.700 --> 25:43.735
Oh!

25:50.080 --> 25:51.172
Shawn, what are you doing?

25:51.210 --> 25:52.768
Yeah, what are
we doing, Shawn?

25:52.810 --> 25:54.072
I need to borrow
some tools.

25:54.120 --> 25:55.075
What kind of tools?

25:55.120 --> 25:56.314
Digging tools.

25:56.350 --> 25:57.817
A little excavation project
we got going on.

25:57.850 --> 25:59.317
Are you still on that
dinosaur thing?

25:59.350 --> 26:00.886
We're still on_ that
dinosaur thing?

26:00.920 --> 26:01.989
What, is there
an echo in here?

26:02.020 --> 26:04.159
Yes, we're still on
the dinosaur thing.

26:04.190 --> 26:05.623
We step foot
on the far end

26:05.660 --> 26:07.082
of this guy Walker's
farm in Ojai

26:07.130 --> 26:08.722
and he starts blasting us
With buckshot.

26:08.760 --> 26:10.125
We know our dead guy
was there every night

26:10.160 --> 26:11.696
leading up to his death,

26:11.730 --> 26:13.163
digging around the periphery
of this property.

26:13.200 --> 26:15.134
No, Shawn, wait.

26:15.170 --> 26:17.058
I don't want you
borrowing my tools.

26:17.100 --> 26:18.738
Oh, Gus will leave
his class ring as collateral.

26:18.770 --> 26:20.032
No, I won't.
Yes, you will.

26:20.070 --> 26:21.071
No, I won't.
Sure you will.

26:21.110 --> 26:22.304
No, I won't.
I can't support this.

26:22.340 --> 26:24.376
Well, there's a shocker.

26:24.410 --> 26:26.071
You not being supportive.

26:26.110 --> 26:27.042
Would you shut up and listen?

26:27.080 --> 26:28.638
I'm saying I can't support
you going somewhere

26:28.680 --> 26:29.749
Where you could get shot.

26:29.780 --> 26:31.839
What, are you--

26:31.890 --> 26:32.879
are you worried
about me?

26:32.920 --> 26:34.114
Shawn, I've been worried
about you

26:34.160 --> 26:35.286
since you were
three years old

26:35.320 --> 26:36.878
and started eating
your own toenails.

26:36.920 --> 26:38.285
Huh.

26:38.330 --> 26:41.197
Well, Dad,
I'll be fine, okay?

26:41.230 --> 26:42.356
We're not gonna go
anywhere near the house.

26:42.400 --> 26:43.697
And if it'll make you feel
any better,

26:43.730 --> 26:45.220
I will stand behind Gus
the entire time.

26:45.270 --> 26:45.964
No, you won't.
Yes, I will.

26:46.000 --> 26:47.297
No, you won't.
Oh, yes, I will.

26:47.330 --> 26:48.331
You want to bet?
I don't like it.

26:48.370 --> 26:50.907
It doesn't feel right.

26:50.940 --> 26:52.066
I know feelings.

26:52.110 --> 26:54.408
Pardon me?

26:54.440 --> 26:58.171
Did--did you just say
"I know feelings?"

27:02.350 --> 27:05.148
(Gus)
Perfect.
This Will be easy.

27:05.190 --> 27:06.714
Oh, there's a pattern here.

27:06.750 --> 27:08.149
Those guys dig
With a reason.

27:08.190 --> 27:09.714
How do you know that?

27:09.760 --> 27:12.126
Gus, I worked at the museum
for almost an entire weekend

27:12.160 --> 27:15.288
before I got canned.

27:15.330 --> 27:16.854
(Shawn)
He was the worst
tic-tac-toe player

27:16.900 --> 27:17.889
in the history of the world.

27:17.930 --> 27:20.797
Wait a second.

27:20.840 --> 27:22.432
Those weren't
tic-tac-toe boards.

27:22.470 --> 27:24.199
Those were all
the places he'd dug.

27:24.240 --> 27:25.969
There were like 25 X5.

27:26.010 --> 27:27.329
No way he scored
that often.

27:27.370 --> 27:29.031
The Xs were misses.

27:29.080 --> 27:31.275
In this case,
"O" makes the spot.

27:42.120 --> 27:43.951
And that's the "O."

27:53.000 --> 27:55.730
This is the only hole
filled by a bulldozer.

27:55.770 --> 27:57.397
No self-respecting
paleontologist

27:57.440 --> 28:00.204
would use a bulldozer.

28:00.240 --> 28:01.377
Why do you know that?

28:01.410 --> 28:03.105
Because, Shawn,
if you use a bull--

28:03.140 --> 28:04.368
Gus, I don't actually
want to know.

28:04.410 --> 28:06.105
Then don't ask.

28:06.150 --> 28:07.845
Here.
This shouldn't take long.

28:07.880 --> 28:10.212
Grab a shovel.

28:10.250 --> 28:12.889
And keep an eye out
for that farmer.

28:12.920 --> 28:15.912
[crows cawing]

28:20.330 --> 28:22.025
How you doing on your side?

28:22.060 --> 28:24.221
(Shawn)
Good, solid.

28:24.270 --> 28:25.999
I'm holding up.

28:26.030 --> 28:28.362
Shawn!
What?

28:28.400 --> 28:29.139
I'm keeping watch.

28:29.170 --> 28:31.968
That's how
the other guy died.

28:32.010 --> 28:34.808
What,
you're not concerned?

28:34.840 --> 28:36.899
Oh!

28:36.940 --> 28:39.079
All right, I get it!

28:39.110 --> 28:40.304
It's my turn.

28:40.350 --> 28:45.378
[Shawn moaning
and grunting]

28:45.420 --> 28:47.183
This is the end
of the loose dirt.

28:47.220 --> 28:48.357
Be careful.

28:48.390 --> 28:50.255
[groaning]

28:54.900 --> 28:56.356
This is weird.

28:56.400 --> 28:58.493
What, that there's rocks
in the ground?

28:58.530 --> 29:01.897
These aren't rocks.

29:01.940 --> 29:02.929
These are fossils.

29:02.970 --> 29:04.961
But they've been processed,

29:05.010 --> 29:07.365
finished off, residue,
rocks chipped away.

29:07.410 --> 29:10.072
Stuff you would normally
do in a lab.

29:10.110 --> 29:13.375
Franzen found something.

29:13.410 --> 29:15.275
Why wouldn't he just
take it out

29:15.320 --> 29:20.212
and do the work in the lab
Where it should be done?

29:20.250 --> 29:22.514
Unless...

29:22.560 --> 29:24.221
Unless it was
too big to move.

29:24.260 --> 29:27.525
Oh, dude, I'm gonna get
the leaf blower.

29:27.560 --> 29:31.326
You brought
a leaf blower?

29:31.370 --> 29:33.065
[motor starts]

29:33.100 --> 29:36.092
[leaf blower whirring]

29:38.570 --> 29:40.458
[whirring dies off]

29:40.510 --> 29:44.105
[both coughing]

29:44.150 --> 29:47.404
You gotta be kidding me.

29:47.450 --> 29:50.442
I just discovered
a dinosaur.

29:57.290 --> 30:00.157
Filling that hole was
the worst idea ever.

30:00.190 --> 30:02.556
Un-uh.
It had to be done, Gus.

30:02.600 --> 30:05.819
We have to save it for when
we unmask Franzen's killer.

30:05.870 --> 30:07.997
I still don't get it.

30:08.040 --> 30:11.009
He was_on the trail
of a fossH graveyard.

30:11.040 --> 30:13.008
It lead him right
to Deacon Farms.

30:13.040 --> 30:14.473
Farmer wouldn't let him
dig on the land,

30:14.510 --> 30:17.138
so he takes matters
into his own hands

30:17.180 --> 30:19.068
after hours.

30:19.110 --> 30:21.169
But Why wouldn't
the farmer let him dig?

30:21.220 --> 30:23.074
Maybe he didn't want
his farm disturbed.

30:23.120 --> 30:24.940
[grunting]

30:24.990 --> 30:27.914
A dig like that is worth
millions to a land owner.

30:27.960 --> 30:29.279
And the fossils
I discovered

30:29.320 --> 30:30.924
weren't even
on crop land.

30:30.960 --> 30:31.984
You discovered?

30:32.030 --> 30:34.055
Don't try to take away
my dinosaur discovery, Shawn.

30:34.100 --> 30:35.089
I wouldn't dream of it.

30:35.130 --> 30:36.097
I'm sorry.
It was all you.

30:36.130 --> 30:38.098
I'm very proud of you.

30:38.130 --> 30:40.189
Don't you think once
they unearth that thing

30:40.230 --> 30:41.436
there would be
a swarm of people

30:41.470 --> 30:43.165
crashing in
from all over the world?

30:43.200 --> 30:44.906
Why didn't he just
lease the land?

30:44.940 --> 30:47.261
I don't get it.

30:47.310 --> 30:50.006
I've got an idea.
What?

30:50.040 --> 30:51.268
Let's ask him.

30:51.310 --> 30:52.402
What?!

30:52.450 --> 30:54.941
We're pretty sure we just
found a cold-blooded murderer,

30:54.980 --> 30:56.117
and you want to go
to his house

30:56.150 --> 30:57.117
and ask him about it?

30:57.150 --> 30:58.378
We can ask nicely.
No!

30:58.420 --> 30:59.444
All right, all right.

30:59.490 --> 31:01.378
We come up
With a cover story.

31:01.420 --> 31:02.489
We're vacuum salesmen.

31:02.520 --> 31:05.182
No...traveling gypsies.

31:05.230 --> 31:07.186
[slapping ground]
No,no,no!

31:07.230 --> 31:09.255
We'll do
Of Mice and Men.

31:09.300 --> 31:10.892
I'm Lennie.
No.

31:10.930 --> 31:13.490
"George, you said
that I could take care

31:13.530 --> 31:16.237
of those rabbits, George."
Shawn.

31:16.270 --> 31:18.101
"And later on you're gonna
cook those beets."
Shawn!

31:18.140 --> 31:19.266
"Beets make me go--"

31:19.310 --> 31:21.039
No Lennie.

31:21.080 --> 31:22.479
Gus, you know how long
I've been waiting

31:22.510 --> 31:23.534
to pull out my Lennie?

31:23.580 --> 31:25.047
No, Shawn, we do

31:25.080 --> 31:27.298
the National Paleontology
Society thing as agreed.

31:27.350 --> 31:29.238
And we keep it
very, very simple.

31:29.280 --> 31:31.919
It's not as much fun _
as Whipping out my Lennie.

31:31.950 --> 31:33.212
And why are we stopping here?

31:33.250 --> 31:35.980
Have you tried
these peaches?

31:36.020 --> 31:38.159
You're back.

31:38.190 --> 31:39.179
Yes, sir, we are.

31:39.230 --> 31:40.424
We're addicted
to your Citrus.

31:40.460 --> 31:41.597
P_eaches aren't
Citrus, Shawn.

31:41.630 --> 31:43.052
They're stone fruit.

31:43.100 --> 31:43.998
It's the same thing.

31:44.030 --> 31:45.566
No, not the same thing.
They have pits.

31:45.600 --> 31:47.261
Peaches, cherries,
plums, and apricots.

31:47.300 --> 31:48.164
I can't do this With you
right now.

31:48.200 --> 31:50.395
Does your fruit come
from Walker Farms?

31:50.440 --> 31:52.032
Oh, no.

31:52.070 --> 31:53.628
We grow on our own
little parcel of land.

31:53.670 --> 31:55.069
Deacon Walker's farm

31:55.110 --> 31:57.635
used to be a supplier
of ours years ago,

31:57.680 --> 32:01.571
but they don't grow nearly
as much as they used to.

32:01.620 --> 32:04.680
Thank you so much
for your information.

32:04.720 --> 32:06.278
If you have a moment,
my friend and I

32:06.320 --> 32:07.719
would like to buy
every peach on that truck.

32:07.750 --> 32:09.308
Including the one
you're eating.

32:16.600 --> 32:19.091
You sure you don't want
to do Of Mice And Men?

32:19.130 --> 32:20.620
You so much
as slur one word,

32:20.670 --> 32:21.659
I'll give you
an Indian burn so hot

32:21.700 --> 32:23.133
your socks
Will catch fire.

32:23.170 --> 32:24.706
"Indian burn."

32:24.740 --> 32:26.469
I haven't been threatened
With that this millennium.

32:26.510 --> 32:28.375
Take a shot
if your ulna feels safe.

32:28.410 --> 32:30.628
I don't think the ulna's
in the forearm.

32:30.680 --> 32:33.103
Trust me, it is.

32:33.150 --> 32:34.242
How can you
Indian burn a bone?

32:34.280 --> 32:35.508
Stop analyzing
my threat.

32:35.550 --> 32:38.246
Get it right.
I got it right.

32:38.290 --> 32:40.383
Deacon Walker?
Sullivan Walker.

32:40.420 --> 32:41.648
Is Deacon Walker home?

32:41.690 --> 32:44.250
There is
no Deacon Walker.

32:44.290 --> 32:47.225
Hmph.
That's confusing.

32:47.260 --> 32:49.490
I've got nothing.
Gus?

32:49.530 --> 32:51.669
Then why name the farm
Deacon Walker Farms?

32:51.700 --> 32:53.395
Because it used to be called
Deacon Walker.

32:53.430 --> 32:55.739
Roger Deacon was my partner.
He's not anymore.

32:55.770 --> 32:58.034
Oh.
That cleans it up nicely.

32:58.070 --> 32:59.139
Maybe we come in?

32:59.170 --> 33:00.535
No.
What do you want?

33:00.570 --> 33:03.277
We're from the National
Paleontological Society--

33:03.310 --> 33:05.449
Not interested.

33:07.250 --> 33:08.717
Clearly
he's not interested.

33:13.290 --> 33:15.781
We would like to make you
a very sizeable offer

33:15.820 --> 33:19.028
on a very small portion
of your--

33:19.060 --> 33:22.052
[both exhale]

33:26.200 --> 33:28.395
Hello, my name is Lennie.
I like to--

33:33.370 --> 33:35.429
You think he'd open up
if we knocked again?

33:40.450 --> 33:42.714
I'm glad it only took us
an hour to get up here.

33:42.750 --> 33:46.481
Not like I wasted
a whole day.

33:46.520 --> 33:48.317
(Shawn)
Franzen dug up here too?

33:59.830 --> 34:01.388
No, he didn't.

34:01.440 --> 34:04.739
These are all new
and dug With a bulldozer.

34:04.770 --> 34:05.600
A real paleontologist--

34:05.640 --> 34:07.198
would never use
such an indelicate tool.

34:07.240 --> 34:08.730
I got it.

34:08.780 --> 34:10.736
So our farmer's
been digging too.

34:10.780 --> 34:12.475
Right.

34:12.510 --> 34:14.478
But if the gold mine's
out there,

34:14.520 --> 34:16.670
Why is he digging
over here?

34:18.620 --> 34:20.144
[cell phone rings]

34:22.290 --> 34:23.484
It's my dad.

34:23.520 --> 34:26.421
Think he wants
his leaf blower back?

34:26.460 --> 34:28.451
(Henry)
Shawn?

34:28.500 --> 34:30.422
Shawn, you're not anywhere
near that farmhouse, are you?

34:30.460 --> 34:32.621
Dad, how dare you?
Of course not.

34:32.670 --> 34:33.659
Good.
Stay away, Shawn.

34:33.700 --> 34:34.860
I know Where I remember
that farm.

34:34.900 --> 34:36.367
Deacon Walker Farm.

34:36.400 --> 34:37.731
I was up there
about 20 years ago.

34:37.770 --> 34:39.806
A girl reported that
her boyfriend went missing.

34:39.840 --> 34:41.205
Roger Deacon.

34:41.240 --> 34:42.730
He was a partner
in the farm.

34:42.780 --> 34:44.600
He was never found, Shawn.

34:44.650 --> 34:46.845
Never found?

34:46.880 --> 34:48.142
That's right, the farmer
claimed he went back

34:48.180 --> 34:49.408
to England
or some nonsense.

34:49.450 --> 34:50.678
The point is, we never
found out Where he went.

34:50.720 --> 34:53.280
Uh, I think I might know
Where he is.

34:53.320 --> 34:54.617
Where?

34:54.660 --> 34:55.786
I might be looking at him.

34:55.820 --> 34:57.788
Shawn!
Gotta go.

34:57.820 --> 35:00.129
Shawn!
God--

35:00.160 --> 35:02.424
Dude.
What?

35:06.170 --> 35:08.365
It now appears a lot of our
evidence is circumstantial.

35:08.400 --> 35:10.231
We're checking
the grad student's alibi,

35:10.270 --> 35:11.669
but I'm not as confident
as I like to be.

35:11.710 --> 35:12.904
Shawn Spencer's on line one.

35:12.940 --> 35:14.032
What does he want?

35:14.070 --> 35:17.506
He wants us to go meet him
in the Ojai Valley somewhere.

35:17.540 --> 35:18.768
We're in the middle
of the Franzen case.

35:18.810 --> 35:20.505
I told him that.

35:20.550 --> 35:21.574
He guarantees
that in ten minutes

35:21.620 --> 35:23.349
he can solve the case,
nab the killer,

35:23.380 --> 35:25.189
close an additional
unsolved murder,

35:25.220 --> 35:27.188
and...

35:27.220 --> 35:28.915
And what?

35:28.960 --> 35:31.656
Unearth a dinosaur.

35:31.690 --> 35:32.850
Well...

35:32.890 --> 35:34.494
I'm curious.

35:43.840 --> 35:47.867
This is as far
as my property goes.

35:47.910 --> 35:49.468
That's all there is.

35:49.510 --> 35:52.399
Well, I've answered all
your questions, Detective.

35:52.450 --> 35:53.849
What more
do you want from me?

35:53.880 --> 35:55.916
_ I'm not _
entirely sure, Sir.

35:55.950 --> 35:58.248
We just have one more person
we need you to talk to.

36:01.590 --> 36:03.285
Lennie?

36:03.320 --> 36:05.185
Lennie?
Don't even ask.

36:05.230 --> 36:08.688
My name is not Lennie,
Mr. Walker.

36:08.730 --> 36:10.948
But if it were,
I would've been amazing.

36:11.000 --> 36:11.967
No, you wouldn't have.

36:12.000 --> 36:13.365
Would've brought tears, Gus.

36:13.400 --> 36:14.435
Guys, the point?

36:14.470 --> 36:17.462
The truth is...
I'm a psychic.

36:17.500 --> 36:19.730
I work for the SBPD.

36:19.770 --> 36:21.772
And the mystic vibrations
of the sea

36:21.810 --> 36:22.902
have brought me here

36:22.940 --> 36:27.274
to solve not one,
but two murders.

36:27.310 --> 36:28.618
You're a What?

36:28.650 --> 36:30.777
Christopher Franzen was
a persistent annoyance, huh?

36:30.820 --> 36:32.879
He couldn't help it.

36:32.920 --> 36:33.887
His department
was going under.

36:33.920 --> 36:36.787
He was desperate to find
something significant

36:36.820 --> 36:37.787
to save his career.

36:37.820 --> 36:41.221
And he knew that your property
held the key.

36:41.260 --> 36:43.558
But you wouldn't
let him dig.

36:43.600 --> 36:46.467
You couldn't let him dig.

36:46.500 --> 36:48.730
So he did What any
self-respecting paleontologist

36:48.770 --> 36:51.238
on the verge of a nervous
breakdown would do.

36:51.270 --> 36:53.238
He dug anyway.

36:53.270 --> 36:56.774
Secretly.
Under the blanket of night.

36:56.810 --> 36:58.346
And into the early morning.

36:58.380 --> 37:00.974
And he dug,
and he dug,

37:01.010 --> 37:03.877
and he found something.

37:10.320 --> 37:12.254
And that's
When you found him.

37:12.290 --> 37:14.326
You knew the magnitude
of the find.

37:14.360 --> 37:16.294
Once word got out,

37:16.330 --> 37:17.922
you'd never be able to keep
the rest of the world

37:17.960 --> 37:18.927
from digging here too.

37:18.970 --> 37:20.528
And you couldn't have
the rest of the world

37:20.570 --> 37:22.333
digging here either,
could you?

37:22.370 --> 37:23.337
Shawn!

37:23.370 --> 37:25.008
Dad?

37:25.040 --> 37:26.268
What are you
doing here?

37:26.310 --> 37:27.436
I was worried.

37:27.470 --> 37:29.734
About my tools.

37:29.780 --> 37:31.031
What?

37:31.080 --> 37:32.877
IfI had known you were
finally smart enough

37:34.010 --> 37:34.840
to come up here, Shawn.

37:34.880 --> 37:35.869
Shawn, will you tell them
Why Walker

37:35.920 --> 37:37.012
wouldn't let him dig?

37:39.920 --> 37:41.888
Deacon is buried
on the property!

37:41.920 --> 37:42.909
(Shawn)
Dad!

37:42.960 --> 37:45.724
Dad, you just blew
the big reveal.

37:45.760 --> 37:47.022
You already mentioned
his name, Shawn.

37:47.060 --> 37:49.358
They don't know that Deacon
was the partner

37:49.400 --> 37:51.425
Walker killed 20 years ago.

37:51.470 --> 37:52.926
Hey, now wait a minute here--

37:52.970 --> 37:53.959
He what now?

37:54.000 --> 37:55.934
Yeah, he killed Deacon

37:55.970 --> 37:57.597
and he buried him
somewhere on the farm

37:57.640 --> 37:59.301
and he can't remember where.

37:59.340 --> 38:00.864
Isn't that right,
Farmer Shooty Pants?

38:00.910 --> 38:03.572
I don't have to stand here
and take this.

38:03.610 --> 38:05.544
No, actually you do.

38:05.580 --> 38:06.979
What does this have to do
With Christopher Franzen?

38:07.010 --> 38:08.648
He killed Franzen
When he caught him

38:08.680 --> 38:11.888
standing above his
dinosaur skull discovery,

38:11.920 --> 38:14.559
sending him flying right into
the teeth of the dinosaur.

38:14.590 --> 38:15.989
But he couldn't bury
him here.

38:16.020 --> 38:17.578
No, no, no,
he had called the farm.

38:17.620 --> 38:19.087
He had snooped
around the farm.

38:19.130 --> 38:20.552
There was a trail
to the farm.

38:20.590 --> 38:21.921
No, he had to dump him
somewhere

38:21.960 --> 38:23.097
Where there'd be
no foren5ics.

38:23.130 --> 38:26.622
Like the ocean.

38:26.670 --> 38:28.558
Just let the salt water
clean the corpse

38:28.600 --> 38:29.999
and wash it ashore.

38:30.040 --> 38:32.031
And the murder scene.

38:32.070 --> 38:34.004
Well, he hopped on
his handy bulldozer

38:34.040 --> 38:36.679
and filled the hole.

38:36.710 --> 38:39.042
I'm getting a bad feeling
about your streak.

38:39.080 --> 38:41.913
You too, huh?

38:41.950 --> 38:42.939
I think I need a lawyer.

38:42.980 --> 38:43.969
I think you're right.

38:44.020 --> 38:45.044
Put your hands
behind your back.

38:45.090 --> 38:46.819
What?
You heard me.

38:46.850 --> 38:47.817
You still haven't _answered
the question

38:47.850 --> 38:49.056
Why he dug all the holes
around the house, Shawn.

38:49.090 --> 38:51.957
Dad, that's the finale.

38:51.990 --> 38:55.858
That's Why I don't invite you
to these things.

38:55.900 --> 38:58.892
He was looking
for Deacon's body.

38:58.930 --> 39:00.022
Whatever.

39:00.070 --> 39:01.697
Are we done here,
Mr. Spencer?

39:01.740 --> 39:03.367
No, we're not done.

39:03.400 --> 39:07.404
For my final
demonstration...

39:07.440 --> 39:08.532
I will now...

39:08.580 --> 39:10.138
discover a dinosaur.

39:10.180 --> 39:12.375
Shawn!

39:12.410 --> 39:14.139
Actually...

39:14.180 --> 39:15.841
Gus will discover
a dinosaur.

39:15.880 --> 39:18.144
Wait a second.

39:18.180 --> 39:19.818
You just want me
to dig this hole.

39:21.050 --> 39:22.654
I'm not falling
for that, Shawny boy.

39:22.690 --> 39:24.487
You dig it.

39:24.530 --> 39:25.724
I'll take credit
for the discovery.

39:25.760 --> 39:27.022
Oh, no, you won't.
Give me that shovel.

39:27.060 --> 39:29.119
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
It's too late.

39:29.160 --> 39:30.127
You blew it.
What?!

39:30.160 --> 39:31.422
And whoever discovers it
gets to name it.

39:31.470 --> 39:33.062
I'm naming him Zippy.

39:33.100 --> 39:34.636
Or Chompy.

39:34.670 --> 39:35.739
Zippy the Dinosaur,

39:35.770 --> 39:38.762
discovered by psychic
paleo-sleuth Shawn Spencer!

39:38.810 --> 39:41.802
Give me this shovel,
Shawn!
Unh!

39:53.120 --> 39:55.054
Killed by a dinosaur.

39:55.090 --> 39:56.785
And he's right.

39:56.820 --> 39:58.048
It was an actual dinosaur.

39:58.090 --> 40:00.058
Technically, it's the fall
that killed him.

40:00.090 --> 40:02.092
Not helping.

40:02.130 --> 40:03.859
Oh, come on.

40:03.900 --> 40:04.798
Who am I kidding?
I am doomed.

40:04.830 --> 40:06.866
I am never gonna suspect
an extinct creature.

40:06.900 --> 40:08.026
How can I compete
With that?

40:08.070 --> 40:09.799
You don't
have to compete.

40:09.840 --> 40:11.068
O'Hara, I am
physically incapable

40:11.100 --> 40:13.204
of pointing the finger
at a dragon

40:13.240 --> 40:15.606
or a leprechaun
or the Loch Ness Monster.

40:15.640 --> 40:17.176
I quit.

40:17.210 --> 40:18.131
I'm gonna donate my badge
to charity.

40:18.180 --> 40:19.772
It was a good run, Carlton.

40:19.810 --> 40:21.471
A|| streaks have to end.

40:21.520 --> 40:23.215
Lou Boudreau fielded
the ball cleanly.

40:23.250 --> 40:25.582
You have to let it go.

40:25.620 --> 40:26.939
Who the hell
is Lou Boudreau?

40:26.990 --> 40:28.457
He recorded the out

40:28.490 --> 40:29.912
that ended
DiMaggio's hit streak.

40:29.960 --> 40:30.915
Don't you watch baseball?

40:30.960 --> 40:32.029
Of course I watch baseball.

40:32.060 --> 40:33.027
I just don't know
meaningless facts

40:33.060 --> 40:34.891
from 75 years ago.
66.

40:34.930 --> 40:36.454
You disturb me.

40:38.870 --> 40:39.996
Do you need a hug?

40:40.030 --> 40:42.134
Oh, What do I look like?

40:47.210 --> 40:49.906
Yeah, I'll take the hug.

40:52.810 --> 40:54.573
Okay, thanks.
Okay.

41:01.120 --> 41:02.257
Oh, come on, you guys.

41:02.290 --> 41:04.884
We're still doing
this intervention thing?

41:04.930 --> 41:06.488
Yes, yes, Shawn,
we are.

41:06.530 --> 41:09.954
Son, you have no sense
of responsibility.

41:10.000 --> 41:12.662
And lately you've been
purposefully putting yourself

41:12.700 --> 41:14.793
in a severe amount
of unnecessary danger.

41:14.840 --> 41:17.229
On top of which,
you are constantly

41:17.270 --> 41:18.168
belittling
the good work of--

41:18.200 --> 41:20.600
Actually, Henry,
I stretched the truth a bit.

41:20.640 --> 41:21.971
This isn't about Shawn.

41:22.010 --> 41:24.205
This is about you.

41:24.240 --> 41:25.241
What?

41:25.280 --> 41:26.599
Can we talk about

41:26.650 --> 41:28.208
your obsessive need
for control?

41:28.250 --> 41:30.844
You come into my house,
Devette.

41:30.880 --> 41:32.245
You lie to me?!

41:32.290 --> 41:33.746
Let's try
to be rational.

41:33.790 --> 41:35.155
Did you really drive

41:35.190 --> 41:36.817
all the way up to Ojai

41:36.860 --> 41:38.259
just to crash
Shawn's crowning moment?

41:38.290 --> 41:41.748
Get out.

41:41.800 --> 41:43.119
Henry, we're here for you.
At least listen.

41:43.160 --> 41:46.129
Out now.

41:46.170 --> 41:48.229
Get out!

41:48.270 --> 41:50.261
Out!

41:50.300 --> 41:53.098
I'd like to start.
When I was about seven, he--

41:57.310 --> 41:59.847
God!
