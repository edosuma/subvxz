01:02.921 --> 01:04.921
[rhythmic metallic jangling]

01:51.880 --> 01:53.588
Uh-huh. Move, move, move.

01:59.255 --> 02:02.421
- [children yelling]
- [shouts]

02:14.755 --> 02:16.296
[groans]

02:19.963 --> 02:21.130
[man in Chichewa] Father!

02:21.921 --> 02:23.755
[man] John! John!

02:25.421 --> 02:27.171
[man sobbing]

02:29.588 --> 02:31.671

- [people chanting]

02:53.755 --> 02:58.338
[man, in English] <i>No one is responsible
for the death of this man.</i>

02:59.588 --> 03:04.255
God alone has decided
to take John Kamkwamba.

03:05.380 --> 03:10.921
When God has decided,
then we will know the man by what remains.

03:11.755 --> 03:14.755
By the fruit shall we know the tree.

03:14.838 --> 03:15.838
[murmurs of agreement]

03:15.880 --> 03:17.463
And we have fruit here.

03:18.296 --> 03:24.546
The fruit of the land farmed by John
and his younger brother, Trywell,

03:25.005 --> 03:28.421
since they returned from Dowa
nearly 20 years ago,

03:28.796 --> 03:32.380
and worked this land together
side by side, these two brothers.

03:32.463 --> 03:34.963
[murmurs of agreement]

03:35.046 --> 03:37.338
But there are other fruits
from John Kamkwamba,

03:37.630 --> 03:40.005
many offspring born to him.

03:40.463 --> 03:44.880
His children,
led by his eldest son, Jeremiah,

03:45.421 --> 03:48.838
who must now take over the work
of his departed father.

03:49.671 --> 03:53.588
- And if the fruit is good, then it must...

[wind whistling outside]

06:13.171 --> 06:14.171
William.

06:14.671 --> 06:15.911
[in Chichewa] Give me my radio.

06:20.880 --> 06:22.296
Did you fix Mr. Bamusi's?

06:23.213 --> 06:24.796
No, sir. Not yet.

06:26.546 --> 06:28.046
Go and check the roof.

06:28.130 --> 06:31.713

06:48.296 --> 06:49.796
[goat bleating]

06:53.213 --> 06:55.380
- [in Chichewa] Morning, Papa.
- Sleep better?

07:01.505 --> 07:03.838
[radio news report continues indistinctly]

07:25.796 --> 07:27.796
[metal banging and rattling]

07:30.963 --> 07:33.088
[whispers in Chichewa] Put it on his bed.

07:33.921 --> 07:36.671
[metal banging and rattling]

07:40.421 --> 07:42.314
- [man] Good morning.
- [woman] Good morning to you.

07:42.338 --> 07:44.630
[continuing indistinctly in Chichewa]

07:45.005 --> 07:49.088
- Bad dreams again?
- Yes, hardly slept.

07:55.088 --> 07:56.921
[dog barking]

08:02.255 --> 08:05.046
William! You want Shabani to help you?

08:05.921 --> 08:07.838
No, Ma. I'm fine.

08:09.838 --> 08:11.880
[in English] William, where's my radio?

08:13.755 --> 08:16.463
[in English] Mr. Bamusi, please,
just a few more days.

08:16.546 --> 08:18.505
I'm finding the problem.
It's not the condenser.

08:18.588 --> 08:21.588
I've told your father.
I'm missing my programs, William.

08:21.671 --> 08:23.505
William, if you can't fix it,

08:23.588 --> 08:25.713
you have to give Mr. Bamusi
back his money.

08:26.005 --> 08:27.963
A few days, Mr. Bamusi. I promise.

08:28.046 --> 08:31.380
He's forcing me to come back from work
and talk to my wife and children.

08:31.463 --> 08:32.880
[chuckles] William.

08:32.962 --> 08:35.546
[in Chichewa] Make sure you wash
before you go inside.

08:35.630 --> 08:36.630
[in Chichewa] Yes, Ma.

09:28.588 --> 09:30.921
[William] Papa! Papa!

09:31.213 --> 09:32.380
[Trywell] Hey!

09:32.463 --> 09:34.463
[laughing]

09:36.546 --> 09:38.630
[in Chichewa] Thank you, Papa! Thank you!

09:39.505 --> 09:43.796
Oh, my God! Where is my son?
Who has taken my son?

09:43.880 --> 09:46.130
- Look at the trousers!
- It's okay. It's okay.

09:46.213 --> 09:48.421
Who brought this man here?

09:49.005 --> 09:51.213
Doesn't he know that I love my husband?

09:51.463 --> 09:52.838
Leave the boy alone.

09:53.255 --> 09:57.171
Is he a doctor from Lilongwe
or an engineer from Chimamba?

09:57.421 --> 09:59.630
- It's not too big?
- It's perfect.

09:59.838 --> 10:01.505
Dear Father,

10:02.213 --> 10:06.463
we thank you for all the blessings
you have laid on this family.

10:07.338 --> 10:11.963
Please continue to fight for us,
so we may endure any hardship.

10:12.171 --> 10:14.171
- In Jesus's name, Amen.
- Amen.

10:21.255 --> 10:22.630
[chuckling]

10:23.796 --> 10:30.630
When I was a boy, the elders sometimes
hadn't recorded everyone's exact age.

10:31.046 --> 10:32.463
But there was a simple test.

10:33.713 --> 10:39.130
If you could touch your left ear
over your head with your right hand,

10:39.213 --> 10:41.130
you could go to school. [chuckles]

10:42.255 --> 10:45.338
The first time I tried, I was too small.

10:46.546 --> 10:47.546
I couldn't reach.

10:50.255 --> 10:51.255
Do it.

10:52.963 --> 10:55.380
That was for you to go
to primary school, Papa.

10:55.463 --> 10:56.880
[all chuckling]

10:58.005 --> 11:00.130
- Of course I can do it.
- I know.

11:03.713 --> 11:05.005
[laughs]

11:10.213 --> 11:11.213
Go to school.

11:11.838 --> 11:13.838
[indistinct chatter]

11:16.921 --> 11:17.921
Gilbert.

11:20.130 --> 11:21.130
Gilbert.

11:23.838 --> 11:25.338
- Hey!
- [both chuckling]

11:26.005 --> 11:28.671
- [in English] Looking sharp, man.
- You too, man. [laughs]

11:29.838 --> 11:31.588
[both chuckling]

11:31.713 --> 11:33.564
[Gilbert] I think this is
a bit too loose for you.

11:33.588 --> 11:35.713
- [William] Room to grow, room to grow.
- [both laugh]

11:40.130 --> 11:42.171
[in Chichewa]
One phosphorus, one more organic.

11:42.588 --> 11:45.838
- You want an ox cart?
- No, I brought the bike.

11:48.296 --> 11:49.880
There's flooding in Mozambique.

11:50.880 --> 11:51.880
Mozambique?

11:53.088 --> 11:54.505
I've heard it on the radio.

11:54.796 --> 11:57.213
[women chatter indistinctly in Chichewa]

12:02.171 --> 12:06.088
[in Chichewa] Justina's relatives found
her a job at the agricultural ministry.

12:06.546 --> 12:07.880
Don't worry.

12:09.046 --> 12:15.296
After university,
you'll have no problem finding a job.

12:16.546 --> 12:21.380
You'll do things
even I didn't think women could do.

12:21.630 --> 12:26.921
[crowd chanting in Chichewa]
N.U.P. government! N.U.P. government!

12:27.130 --> 12:29.171
Another six months of this bullshit.

12:32.588 --> 12:35.296
You know the president
is even coming to Kasungu.

12:35.963 --> 12:37.963
[chanting continues]

12:39.005 --> 12:40.005
Democracy.

12:42.255 --> 12:44.713
Democracy is just like imported cassava.

12:48.463 --> 12:49.546
It rots quickly.

12:51.005 --> 12:53.046
[chanting continues]

13:25.171 --> 13:29.046
[in English] Of course, Kachokolo is not
the wealthiest school in the district,

13:29.171 --> 13:34.005
but it's down to each one of you
to decide your own level of commitment.

13:34.546 --> 13:37.296
- Your own level of what?
- [pupils] Commitment!

13:43.380 --> 13:46.880
We have had students excel
in their junior certificate

13:46.963 --> 13:49.755
and some of them
have even gone on to university.

13:50.255 --> 13:51.921
Did these people have two heads?

13:52.005 --> 13:54.088
- [pupils] No, Mr. Headmaster.
- [thunder rumbling]

13:54.171 --> 13:57.255
- What did they not have?
- [pupils] Two heads!

13:58.130 --> 14:02.338
[headmaster] They worked hard.
Simple as that. What did they do?

14:02.546 --> 14:03.796
[pupils] Worked hard.

14:03.963 --> 14:06.796
When we have received
the full payment for the term,

14:06.921 --> 14:09.921
you will receive your library card
from Mrs. Sikelo.

14:10.338 --> 14:12.130
- [wind whistling]
- What will I give you?

14:12.421 --> 14:14.130
[pupils] Library cards.

14:14.755 --> 14:16.630
[thunder rumbling]

14:17.838 --> 14:21.796
Your library cards will allow you
to take some books home overnight.

14:22.046 --> 14:25.046
So, with dedication, there's no reason...

14:25.213 --> 14:27.421
Everybody, go to your form rooms.

14:27.796 --> 14:31.380
Your form teachers will take you through
the rest of the day's activities.

14:31.463 --> 14:33.463
[excited shouts, chatter]

14:34.463 --> 14:35.796
[rain drums on metal roof]

14:35.880 --> 14:38.671
[man] Everybody, find your seat.
Find your seat.

14:44.046 --> 14:46.505
Your first day of school
and the rains have come.

14:46.713 --> 14:48.338
A good sign, I wonder.

14:48.546 --> 14:50.838
My name is Mr. Kachigunda.

14:52.380 --> 14:56.588
I will be your form tutor
and science teacher for the year.

14:56.713 --> 15:00.963
- Good morning.
- [pupils] Good morning, Mr. Kachigunda.

15:01.255 --> 15:02.380
Take your seats.

15:03.130 --> 15:07.755
Okay, let's get right on with it.
Basic algebra: <i>x </i> and <i>y.</i>

15:11.088 --> 15:12.128
[in Chichewa] Mr. Godsten.

15:12.796 --> 15:14.838
Mama said that Justina left for Lilongwe.

15:15.380 --> 15:16.380
Yes, she's gone.

15:17.005 --> 15:18.588
[thunder rumbles]

15:18.671 --> 15:20.296
Do you need help here?

15:21.463 --> 15:22.588
Not any we can afford.

15:23.255 --> 15:24.296
[sawing nearby]

15:24.380 --> 15:25.546
[murmurs in Chichewa]

15:25.963 --> 15:28.755
Will you let me know
if you hear of any work in the market?

15:28.838 --> 15:29.838
Of course.

15:39.088 --> 15:40.380
[metal clanging]

15:40.463 --> 15:42.880
[pupils chattering, laughing]

15:44.005 --> 15:45.255
[William] Mr. Kachigunda.

15:46.963 --> 15:50.046
[in English] It's from my sister, Annie,
for her university placement.

15:52.130 --> 15:53.505
You're William Kamkwamba?

15:54.005 --> 15:55.005
Yes, sir.

15:58.380 --> 16:00.088
Tell your father to pay the fees.

16:01.546 --> 16:02.546
He's paid, sir.

16:03.213 --> 16:05.505
Only the down payment.
There's no grace period here.

16:06.671 --> 16:09.631
Tell your father to pay the rest
or you won't be allowed to come to school.

16:12.130 --> 16:13.546
Yes, sir. He'll pay, sir.

16:15.671 --> 16:16.671
Good.

16:22.755 --> 16:25.421
William, look who's been waiting.

16:27.046 --> 16:28.046
Khamba!

16:53.505 --> 16:54.505
[door shuts]

17:04.130 --> 17:06.296
[in Chichewa] William, it's too dark.

17:07.505 --> 17:08.963
We have a science test.

17:09.671 --> 17:13.421
- Can I use kerosene?
- There's not enough for studying.

17:14.421 --> 17:16.213
Go and help your father plant.

17:21.588 --> 17:22.796
[in English] That's okay.

17:23.838 --> 17:25.421
You need to see me after class.

17:26.505 --> 17:29.463
William, you can do better.
Gilbert, I'm not so sure.

17:31.338 --> 17:32.421
That's good.

17:32.755 --> 17:35.796
- [Gilbert] At least you passed.
- [William] Sixty-two is not enough.

17:35.921 --> 17:39.463
We need to go to the junkyard.
We need to find a way to study at night.

17:41.171 --> 17:42.671
[William] There's been a delivery.

17:42.796 --> 17:43.796
[dog whines]

17:46.088 --> 17:48.546
[Gilbert] It's just more shit
from the tobacco estate.

18:08.005 --> 18:09.338
[Gilbert] Anything new?

18:12.671 --> 18:13.671
It's a pump.

18:21.130 --> 18:22.130
Hey!

18:30.088 --> 18:31.171
[thunder rumbling]

18:31.338 --> 18:34.463
[man]
<i>When the tobacco estates moved south,</i>

18:35.005 --> 18:38.921
<i>it made it hard for us to compete
to grow tobacco.</i>

18:39.338 --> 18:44.588
And then they took the trees to burn
to dry their tobacco leaves.

18:45.088 --> 18:51.796
We once had a beautiful country
that my son will never see.

18:51.880 --> 18:52.880
[murmurs of agreement]

18:53.296 --> 18:55.630
[man 2]
We have been instructed by the estate

18:55.880 --> 18:59.046
to offer 2,000 kwacha
per tonne of forestry.

18:59.130 --> 19:00.255
[overlapping protests]

19:00.338 --> 19:03.546
[in Chichewa] Papa, what's going on?
They're taking the trees?

19:04.005 --> 19:06.046
Who said you could come to the meeting?

19:07.546 --> 19:08.588
Gilbert is allowed.

19:08.880 --> 19:10.463
[Trywell] And so? Go!

19:11.588 --> 19:12.588
Go!

19:13.088 --> 19:16.005
[man 2 in English] Of course, if you don't
want to take this opportunity,

19:16.088 --> 19:18.463
we will be forced
to take our business elsewhere.

19:18.546 --> 19:19.671
[raised voices]

19:20.338 --> 19:22.963
[man 2] Let the chief speak.
Let the chief speak.

19:23.880 --> 19:27.880
Of course, the estates know
that the rains came late this year,

19:27.963 --> 19:29.421
and they have come heavy.

19:29.713 --> 19:32.380
They know that there has been flooding
in Mozambique.

19:32.755 --> 19:37.088
They know that without finances,
we can't build proper defenses,

19:37.213 --> 19:39.046
and so we rely on the trees.

19:39.463 --> 19:43.130
They watch for every pressure
on us small people,

19:43.380 --> 19:45.046
so they can take from us.

19:46.963 --> 19:50.338
The only power we have is to say no.

19:50.421 --> 19:52.255
[scattered applause, murmurs of agreement]

19:52.380 --> 19:55.338
This is a gross mischaracterization
of the estate's agenda.

19:55.796 --> 19:57.380
We want to work with you people.

19:57.463 --> 19:58.505
[man 3] I'll sign.

19:58.588 --> 19:59.921
[murmurs of discontentment]

20:00.005 --> 20:02.921
- Company man, I will sign.
- For 2,000?

20:03.755 --> 20:05.630
- [man 3] I'll sign.
- Jeremiah.

20:05.755 --> 20:07.505
[in Chichewa] Listen to the chief.

20:08.088 --> 20:10.713
Listen to the chief.
Two thousand is not enough.

20:10.796 --> 20:13.630
[in English] The chief can decide his own.
I can decide my own.

20:15.255 --> 20:17.630
This is madness. We need the money.
I will sign.

20:17.713 --> 20:20.046
[overlapping chatter]

20:20.130 --> 20:21.338
[man shouts in Chichewa]

20:21.880 --> 20:23.963
Who else will sign with Jeremiah?

20:24.046 --> 20:26.046
We can only guarantee this price
for today.

20:26.130 --> 20:27.671
[men groaning]

20:27.963 --> 20:28.963
[whispers] Jeremiah.

20:31.088 --> 20:32.671
[man 2] Think of your families.

20:35.838 --> 20:36.838
[in Chichewa] I'll sign.

20:36.880 --> 20:39.005
[overlapping shouts of disapproval]

20:47.713 --> 20:48.713
[man 4] I'll sign.

20:48.921 --> 20:50.921
- [men groaning]
- [chatter fading]

21:02.130 --> 21:04.450
[Trywell in Chichewa]
<i>These trees protect us from flooding.</i>

21:04.671 --> 21:06.921
Why do you think
your father never sold them?

21:07.380 --> 21:09.088
We'll make more money this way.

21:11.130 --> 21:12.921
There's flooding in Mozambique.

21:13.296 --> 21:14.296
Mozambique?

21:15.421 --> 21:16.921
I have debts in Kasungu.

21:17.338 --> 21:18.796
Then stop gambling.

21:22.130 --> 21:23.546
Don't worry, Uncle Trywell.

21:25.796 --> 21:29.546
I'll support you and your family,
just like my father did.

21:30.338 --> 21:33.421
You keep spending your money
educating your kids,

21:33.880 --> 21:35.255
just so they can leave you.

21:36.880 --> 21:38.671
The smart ones
will get the hell out of here.

21:40.213 --> 21:41.338
And I promise you,

21:42.046 --> 21:44.213
when I have enough money to go,

21:44.963 --> 21:46.088
I'll give you my land.

21:52.380 --> 21:53.796
I don't want your land.

21:55.130 --> 21:57.380
Then my father was right...

21:59.463 --> 22:00.630
not to leave it to you.

22:03.171 --> 22:05.005
There's nothing wrong with gambling.

22:05.921 --> 22:08.081
Look at how these rains have been
these last few years.

22:08.796 --> 22:10.005
We're all gambling.

22:16.421 --> 22:17.963
[thunder rumbles]

22:37.463 --> 22:38.505
[dog barks]

23:06.463 --> 23:09.338
[chainsaws whirring in distance]

23:13.463 --> 23:15.481
- [dog whines]
- [whispers in English] Stay, Khamba.

23:15.505 --> 23:17.505
[birds screeching]

23:45.921 --> 23:47.421
[men shouting]

24:14.921 --> 24:18.338
[dance music playing on stereo]

24:24.088 --> 24:26.546
[indistinct chatter in Chichewa]

24:30.380 --> 24:33.460
[man in Chichewa] I asked her why they
would send a beautiful woman down here.

24:33.546 --> 24:36.005
She started smiling like this...

24:36.088 --> 24:37.546
[laughter]

24:40.671 --> 24:41.796
So, what happened?

24:43.171 --> 24:44.296
What did you do with her?

24:45.296 --> 24:47.005
You people let children in here now?

24:47.713 --> 24:48.713
He's got brains.

24:49.546 --> 24:51.546
So? How can I talk in front of children?

24:52.005 --> 24:53.088
Which children?

24:53.755 --> 24:55.213
What do you know about women?

24:55.505 --> 24:57.296
I know absolutely everything you know.

24:57.380 --> 24:59.963
- [men] Oh! [chuckling]
- [music stops]

25:02.255 --> 25:03.338
[man] What is it?

25:12.088 --> 25:14.005
I told you. These batteries are dying.

25:14.296 --> 25:16.255
- You have more?
- They're all dead.

25:16.421 --> 25:19.088
The game's starting. What do we do now?

25:19.213 --> 25:21.213
[rain pattering on metal roof]

25:23.880 --> 25:25.671
[thunder rumbles]

25:34.796 --> 25:36.588
[mother in Chichewa] Annie, is that you?

25:39.880 --> 25:40.880
[William] No.

25:42.588 --> 25:43.421
Papa.

25:43.546 --> 25:45.963
Should I take my fees with me
to school tomorrow morning?

25:50.546 --> 25:51.546
When the rains stop,

25:52.255 --> 25:55.005
and we're sure of the harvest,
we'll pay the fees.

25:55.088 --> 25:56.838
- But sir...
- You were at the meeting.

25:58.296 --> 25:59.796
They're taking down the trees.

26:00.796 --> 26:02.005
The land could flood.

26:04.463 --> 26:06.255
[thunder rumbles]

26:11.255 --> 26:13.171
[William in English]
Radios use a lot of power,

26:13.713 --> 26:17.213
so when the batteries die,
there's usually a bit of juice at the end.

26:18.380 --> 26:20.755
[in Chichewa]
So if we put a few dead ones together...

26:22.630 --> 26:25.630
- [static, radio broadcast playing]
- [cheering]

26:25.713 --> 26:26.880
Yes!

26:28.213 --> 26:30.713
[newsreader in English]
<i>...took place at 8:46 a.m.</i>

26:31.296 --> 26:33.630
<i>And the second plane
struck the South Tower</i>

26:33.713 --> 26:36.921
<i>at 9:03 a.m. Eastern Standard Time.</i>

26:37.630 --> 26:40.505
<i>- The American president, George W. Bush...</i>
- Find the game!

26:40.588 --> 26:42.130
[murmurs in Chichewa]

26:44.130 --> 26:46.463
- [game chatter over radio]
- [cheering]

26:52.880 --> 26:55.338
[all chanting in Chichewa]

27:12.671 --> 27:14.296
[Gilbert in English] Look! Look!

27:16.005 --> 27:18.630
- [Annie laughs]
- It's Mr. Kachigunda and your sister.

27:19.213 --> 27:20.838
[speaking softly, indistinct]

27:23.755 --> 27:25.755
[Annie and Mr. Kachigunda laughing]

27:36.630 --> 27:37.630
Did you know?

27:38.713 --> 27:39.713
No.

27:42.046 --> 27:44.838
- You can't tell anyone about this.
- [Gilbert] I won't.

27:51.338 --> 27:52.738
[Gilbert] What are you going to do?

27:56.005 --> 27:57.671
You can't just let him get away with it.

28:00.380 --> 28:02.713
What if he disgraces her
and tells everybody?

28:04.255 --> 28:05.755
Let me check the car battery.

28:06.380 --> 28:08.130
- It's dead.
- Let me check.

28:11.255 --> 28:13.713
Is that how
she was able to attend senior classes?

28:14.171 --> 28:15.171
What do you mean?

28:17.588 --> 28:18.588
He was her teacher.

28:20.213 --> 28:21.421
He must have helped her.

28:23.338 --> 28:25.505
That's why she got the grades
for university,

28:25.588 --> 28:28.005
and we're struggling even to get
a junior certificate.

28:29.338 --> 28:31.755
She got good grades
because she studied at night.

28:32.630 --> 28:35.255
I remember.
We had had money for kerosene back then.

28:40.213 --> 28:41.338
You could use this.

28:42.713 --> 28:43.755
To do what?

28:44.755 --> 28:47.921
If you break his bike, you think
he'll walk all the way to the village?

28:55.338 --> 28:56.838
- It's this one.
- Yeah, that's it.

29:02.838 --> 29:04.796
- I can't.
- Huh?

29:07.505 --> 29:08.588
Take the light.

29:09.463 --> 29:12.380
Take it,
and then you'll be able to study at night.

29:23.088 --> 29:24.213
It's not coming off.

29:39.713 --> 29:40.713
Turn the pedal.

29:51.046 --> 29:52.046
Stop.

29:57.338 --> 29:58.338
Start again.

30:32.463 --> 30:33.463
[whispers] Khamba.

30:43.963 --> 30:47.421
- [in Chichewa] I had 5,200.
- Is that everything?

30:50.296 --> 30:51.463
William's schooling?

30:53.005 --> 30:54.213
[Trywell] After the harvest.

30:54.755 --> 30:56.546
[mother] He needs schooling, Trywell.

30:57.255 --> 31:00.171
You want him spending time
with those useless boys?

31:01.630 --> 31:03.255
His mind is just like Annie's.

31:04.463 --> 31:08.838
- Like my mother's.
- [Trywell] Your mother's? That mad woman.

31:09.671 --> 31:12.421
Was it madness
when she came and built the extension?

31:12.921 --> 31:15.671
Making bricks all day at her age
is what killed her.

31:16.713 --> 31:17.921
And we still use it.

31:19.463 --> 31:21.630
The children get it from her.

31:22.880 --> 31:23.880
From my side.

31:26.755 --> 31:27.755
Not from mine?

31:28.796 --> 31:32.213
You're clever enough.
You found me, didn't you?

31:33.296 --> 31:34.630
[both laugh]

31:36.546 --> 31:38.880
That was just luck. [chuckling]

31:40.046 --> 31:42.713
Just because you were
in the marketplace that time.

31:42.796 --> 31:43.880
[laughing]

31:48.671 --> 31:51.046
We need to save everything we can.

31:52.213 --> 31:53.880
There's no money for school fees.

31:55.171 --> 31:56.171
Not right now.

32:06.546 --> 32:08.546
[thunder rumbling]

32:12.505 --> 32:15.963
[headmaster in English]
Phiri, Nyangu, Kamchulu,

32:16.921 --> 32:20.546
Muzombe, Lukwa, Kamanga,

32:21.338 --> 32:23.921
Kamkwamba, and Nkhoma.

32:24.963 --> 32:27.338
If your name has been called,
please stay here.

32:27.796 --> 32:30.088
Everyone else, go to class.

32:44.880 --> 32:47.088
Your school fees have still not been paid.

32:47.546 --> 32:49.005
There is no grace period.

32:50.213 --> 32:54.463
Please go home and collect the fees
if you wish to continue your studies.

33:28.296 --> 33:29.338
[grunting]

33:44.463 --> 33:45.463
[grunts]

34:05.921 --> 34:06.921
Trywell.

34:07.255 --> 34:10.213
[in Chichewa] I'll go to the
auction house. I'll talk to Daniel Ngwata.

34:10.713 --> 34:11.713
Daniel?

34:13.255 --> 34:14.838
You haven't seen him for years.

34:15.880 --> 34:18.130
Maybe he can talk to the estate.

35:04.463 --> 35:06.463
[people chattering]

35:12.963 --> 35:14.755
[in Chichewa]
How do you know this man, Papa?

35:15.171 --> 35:16.338
An old friend.

35:22.005 --> 35:23.005
[man] Trywell.

35:24.505 --> 35:26.588
- [in English] So long. Too long.
- Good to see you.

35:26.713 --> 35:29.755
Is this big man William?
Wow. It's been too long.

35:29.838 --> 35:30.838
[chuckling]

35:31.088 --> 35:32.088
This way, please.

35:35.088 --> 35:39.380
I have some small savings
from when we were in business in Dowa.

35:40.255 --> 35:43.588
But I can use some of it
to buy back the trees on Kamkwamba land

35:43.671 --> 35:45.130
for the price they were bought for.

35:45.213 --> 35:46.213
They won't do that.

35:46.296 --> 35:49.505
No, if you tell them the land is flooding.

35:51.338 --> 35:52.463
We're losing the harvest.

35:52.713 --> 35:56.463
Trywell, they won't do that.
Why would they do that?

35:59.463 --> 36:01.671
Jeremiah sold the trees.

36:03.671 --> 36:05.838
Why didn't your brother
leave you that land?

36:07.505 --> 36:09.921
- You worked hard on that land.
- I don't know.

36:10.755 --> 36:12.995
He should have left it to you
to take care of the family.

36:13.255 --> 36:20.130
It was John's land to leave
to whoever he wants to leave it to.

36:24.963 --> 36:26.505
The Pope. [laughing]

36:27.671 --> 36:28.671
The Pope.

36:29.463 --> 36:31.921
That's what we used to call your father
back then.

36:32.255 --> 36:35.046
The most honest man in all of Dowa market.

36:36.463 --> 36:37.630
We used to laugh at him

36:37.838 --> 36:40.546
because what good can come
from an honest businessman?

36:41.463 --> 36:43.880
We used to laugh at him,
until he had carried off

36:43.963 --> 36:46.380
the most beautiful woman
in the whole place.

36:47.421 --> 36:48.505
For farming.

36:50.088 --> 36:51.128
[in Chichewa] For farming.

36:54.671 --> 36:55.921
[in English] How is Agnes?

37:03.546 --> 37:04.880
Can you help us, Daniel?

37:10.005 --> 37:11.171
[sighs]

37:15.380 --> 37:16.505
The rains, Trywell.

37:20.505 --> 37:22.588
What can anybody do about these rains?

37:23.838 --> 37:27.713
This year, the land is too wet.
Next year, too dry.

37:28.921 --> 37:30.546
You can't do business like that.

37:33.213 --> 37:35.671
All indications have been
that the grain harvest

37:35.796 --> 37:37.046
would be good this year.

37:37.380 --> 37:40.421
Even the International Monetary Fund,
the World Bank,

37:41.046 --> 37:43.380
told the government
to sell all the excess grain

37:43.463 --> 37:44.588
to Mozambique and Kenya.

37:45.755 --> 37:46.838
And so they did.

37:47.463 --> 37:49.588
Now what's happened? The floods have come.

37:50.838 --> 37:53.338
And no one knows if there is enough grain
in this whole country

37:53.421 --> 37:54.838
to protect the farmers.

37:55.463 --> 37:57.463
The government will protect the farmers.

38:00.505 --> 38:02.755
Terrorists have attacked America.

38:04.421 --> 38:05.588
You must have heard it.

38:06.755 --> 38:08.421
All the markets are in free fall.

38:09.380 --> 38:11.963
All these government debts being recalled.

38:15.588 --> 38:16.796
Forget about the trees.

38:18.630 --> 38:19.796
Forget about the savings.

38:21.796 --> 38:25.546
When these rains stop and the sun returns,

38:26.505 --> 38:30.380
Malawi is preparing
for a very long hungry season.

38:36.796 --> 38:38.963
[insects chirping]

39:06.671 --> 39:08.356
[Trywell in English]
<i>The roots are all weak,</i>

39:08.380 --> 39:10.338
<i>and now the sun is drying out the land,</i>

39:10.921 --> 39:14.421
but when the president comes to Kasungu,
there will be journalists there,

39:15.088 --> 39:16.088
and other chiefs.

39:17.546 --> 39:18.755
You could say something.

39:18.963 --> 39:21.130
[in Chichewa]
We can't threaten the president.

39:21.255 --> 39:23.005
[Trywell in Chichewa] It's not threats.

39:23.463 --> 39:24.921
We have to protect ourselves.

39:25.338 --> 39:27.647
[in English] You just let them know
that we know what is happening.

39:27.671 --> 39:30.022
[man] Do you think the government
will leave everyone here to die?

39:30.046 --> 39:31.446
[Trywell in Chichewa] I don't know,

39:31.755 --> 39:33.880
but why should we sit here
waiting to find out?

39:44.005 --> 39:47.630
[in Chichewa]
There was a problem before, 20 years ago.

39:48.046 --> 39:50.213
People ran out of food.

39:50.838 --> 39:53.755
Chief fed them with what he could.

39:54.046 --> 39:56.213
He saved a lot of people.

39:57.005 --> 40:00.088
He'll make sure
it doesn't get that bad again.

40:01.088 --> 40:02.921
And if our harvest is okay,

40:03.463 --> 40:06.046
we'll finish paying
for William's schooling.

40:08.005 --> 40:09.255
And university?

40:13.796 --> 40:14.796
I don't know.

40:21.213 --> 40:23.755
How did you know
Papa was the man you'd marry?

40:28.338 --> 40:29.838
Is someone talking to you?

40:30.796 --> 40:32.588
No, I'm just curious.

40:34.505 --> 40:36.838
There's no one for you in Wimbe.

40:38.713 --> 40:39.713
I know.

40:41.255 --> 40:43.546
Annie, we'll get you off to university.

40:44.796 --> 40:47.005
You won't just be a wife and mother.

40:49.921 --> 40:51.171
No one's been talking?

40:53.505 --> 40:54.630
No one's been talking.

40:59.213 --> 41:00.973
[William in English]
I found another battery.

41:04.046 --> 41:06.921
It's dead,
but if you take out the bad cells,

41:07.755 --> 41:10.338
and connect the positive and negative
with this one,

41:11.296 --> 41:12.671
we can make a good battery.

41:14.088 --> 41:17.630
But it needs to charge.
It needs electricity.

41:18.421 --> 41:20.880
With electricity, we can fix the pump.

41:22.255 --> 41:24.505
We never know what's happening
with the rain.

42:10.088 --> 42:11.255
[Gilbert] What are you doing?

42:11.338 --> 42:13.058
[William]
All I have to do is skip assembly.

42:13.130 --> 42:15.088
I'll only go to science class for now.

42:15.213 --> 42:17.093
Class, make sure
your homework of exercise three

42:17.130 --> 42:19.213
is on my desk at 9 a.m. tomorrow morning.

42:21.630 --> 42:22.838
[William] Mr. Kachigunda.

42:23.880 --> 42:25.046
[Mr. Kachigunda] William.

42:25.755 --> 42:28.755
When you turn the wheel on your bike,
the light shines.

42:29.546 --> 42:31.296
- Yes.
- How?

42:32.296 --> 42:33.380
A dynamo.

42:34.671 --> 42:36.713
How does a dynamo work?

42:37.088 --> 42:41.296
There's a little man on the inside
who rubs his hands together...

42:43.130 --> 42:44.671
It's, uh, magnets.

42:44.921 --> 42:48.421
- Where can I find a dynamo?
- You should try the trading center.

42:49.338 --> 42:52.505
I'm not sure if they'll have one there.
Mine came from Lilongwe.

42:52.963 --> 42:56.380
Well, what would I need to make one?

42:56.963 --> 42:59.421
I'm not sure exactly. A few things.

43:00.296 --> 43:04.213
Uh, a magnet, wiring,
something to break the magnetic field.

43:04.713 --> 43:07.088
If you try the library,
maybe you will find something there.

43:09.880 --> 43:11.296
I don't have a library card.

43:13.921 --> 43:15.630
Because your parents haven't paid.

43:19.463 --> 43:22.713
How do you know I will not tell Mr. Ofesi
that you're coming to my class?

43:26.796 --> 43:28.380
Because I can keep a secret, sir.

43:29.338 --> 43:30.338
A secret?

43:30.588 --> 43:31.588
Yes, sir.

43:33.421 --> 43:36.921
There is a man who comes to my village
to see my sister...

43:39.046 --> 43:40.046
sir.

43:45.880 --> 43:46.880
[knocking]

43:49.463 --> 43:51.338
- [woman] Mr. Kachigunda.
- Mrs. Sikelo.

43:52.505 --> 43:55.171
This is William Kamkwamba.
He's part of my science class.

43:56.005 --> 43:57.213
He's no longer a student here,

43:57.296 --> 43:59.505
but he and I have been working
on various experiments,

43:59.588 --> 44:02.148
and I'd like for him to continue
his studies here in the library.

44:07.630 --> 44:10.380
- Does Mr. Ofesi know about this?
- Of course.

44:10.671 --> 44:12.046
Mr. Ofesi's only stipulation

44:12.130 --> 44:16.380
is the boy is not to be taught or assisted
by you or any other teacher.

44:16.963 --> 44:19.171
It's important to him
that the boy working here

44:19.255 --> 44:20.463
is not common knowledge.

44:20.921 --> 44:23.713
He himself would prefer
not to be reminded of the fact.

44:25.380 --> 44:26.380
Of course.

44:28.005 --> 44:29.421
- Good luck.
- Thank you, sir.

44:32.255 --> 44:36.380
Perhaps you should sit
away from the window.

44:50.130 --> 44:51.130
Ms. Sikelo.

44:53.505 --> 44:54.671
Mr. Kamkwamba.

44:56.088 --> 44:58.671
Are there any books on dynamos?

44:59.088 --> 45:00.088
Dynamos?

45:01.338 --> 45:02.838
Magnets and electricity?

45:03.755 --> 45:05.171
Is this in your class grade?

45:07.713 --> 45:09.463
Maybe I can work with a dictionary.

45:09.588 --> 45:12.588
All the senior textbooks
are on the bottom shelf on the left.

45:51.630 --> 45:54.713
[Mrs. Sikelo] Mr. Kamkwamba?
Did you find what you were looking for?

46:29.380 --> 46:32.838
- [crowd cheering]
- [rapid drumming]

46:46.213 --> 46:49.130
- Welcome, Mr. President.
- Thank you very much. How are you?

46:49.213 --> 46:50.880
[cheering continues]

47:01.671 --> 47:04.255
Thank you for coming Mr. President.
Welcome.

47:06.296 --> 47:08.671
[in Chichewa] Thank you, thank you.

47:09.046 --> 47:12.130
Clap your hands and cheer.

47:12.213 --> 47:13.713
[crowd cheering]

47:14.713 --> 47:17.546
People, I'm saying N.U.P.

47:17.671 --> 47:19.421
[crowd] Government!

47:19.588 --> 47:22.130
Say it three times.

47:22.671 --> 47:27.130
[crowd] N.U.P.!
N.U.P.! N.U.P.! Government!

47:27.213 --> 47:29.213
[crowd cheering]

47:30.171 --> 47:33.505
[in English] Uh, but first of all,
I'd like to thank you, Your Excellency,

47:33.880 --> 47:36.838
for honoring the inauguration
of Chief Mamba.

47:36.963 --> 47:38.296
[cheers and applause]

47:38.921 --> 47:40.505
Can you please stand, Chief?

47:40.630 --> 47:43.046
Yeah! Yeah!

47:44.713 --> 47:47.088
[in Chichewa]
And now I'll leave the mic to Chief Wimbe.

47:47.171 --> 47:49.505
[crowd cheering]

47:51.421 --> 47:54.213
[crowd chanting in Chichewa]

48:02.130 --> 48:03.921
[in English] Your Excellency,

48:04.255 --> 48:09.380
may I first congratulate you
on your achievements in government,

48:09.630 --> 48:12.046
and state that I hope
in the coming election,

48:12.130 --> 48:14.088
you will emerge victorious.

48:14.296 --> 48:16.005
[cheers and applause]

48:18.171 --> 48:22.796
You have been a key factor
in our peace and stability,

48:24.213 --> 48:27.671
when we have seen
the responsibility of government

48:27.838 --> 48:30.713
devolve into chaos across Africa.

48:30.796 --> 48:32.796
[crowd cheering]

48:35.380 --> 48:39.088
However, the recent floods
have created a dangerous situation.

48:41.046 --> 48:45.005
In many regions,
we already know the harvest will fail.

48:45.296 --> 48:47.546
[shouts of agreement]

48:49.171 --> 48:54.255
We know the economic machinery
is not pointed towards us,

48:55.338 --> 48:58.296
but we are now a democracy.

48:58.671 --> 49:02.755
We are prepared to make our voices heard
in the ballot box.

49:03.671 --> 49:07.463
- What is this man trying to do?
- We need an assurance of emergency grain.

49:07.838 --> 49:13.255
We need to know any food issue
will be slaughtered in its infancy.

49:13.338 --> 49:15.671
[scattered shouts of approval]

49:15.755 --> 49:19.796
We need a government
prepared to support its people.

49:21.046 --> 49:24.255
I want to vote for this government,

49:25.796 --> 49:28.671
but cannot vote for any man

49:29.588 --> 49:33.213
who will turn two blind eyes
to a catastrophe.

49:33.338 --> 49:35.838
[crowd members shouting]

49:36.296 --> 49:37.296
[indistinct]

49:37.338 --> 49:40.921
[man]
Democracy at work. Freedom of expression.

49:42.338 --> 49:45.880
Well, His Excellency
will address this misunderstanding,

49:46.713 --> 49:49.130
but for now, let's have some music.

49:49.588 --> 49:51.880
[upbeat music playing over speakers]

49:58.046 --> 49:59.046
Gilbert!

50:17.630 --> 50:19.255
[groans]

50:19.421 --> 50:20.880
[in Chichewa] Father! Father!

50:25.338 --> 50:26.338
William!

50:30.463 --> 50:31.505
William!

50:32.046 --> 50:33.671
- [gunshot]
- [people screaming]

50:34.213 --> 50:35.505
[gunshot]

50:53.963 --> 50:56.171
Father! Father!

50:56.921 --> 50:58.588
Father. Father!

50:59.463 --> 51:00.546
Father!

51:02.005 --> 51:03.421
- [sighs]
- Father!

51:04.671 --> 51:05.796
[voice fading] Father!

51:33.255 --> 51:35.215
[in Chichewa]
Why don't they take him to a clinic?

51:35.546 --> 51:36.546
He's safer here.

51:38.171 --> 51:39.380
Would they come back?

51:39.671 --> 51:40.838
[sighs]

51:41.755 --> 51:43.338
We don't know.

51:45.755 --> 51:47.671
You have to be a man now, William.

51:49.713 --> 51:51.380
No one is coming to help us.

51:52.921 --> 51:54.921
I need you to work with me
on this harvest.

51:56.546 --> 51:58.505
For every piece of grain we can get.

52:01.505 --> 52:02.505
Yes, sir.

52:03.630 --> 52:04.630
[man] Trywell.

52:35.546 --> 52:36.588
Thank you.

52:40.213 --> 52:41.796
[in Chichewa] Is that all there is?

52:42.630 --> 52:43.880
It's not even five bags.

52:44.921 --> 52:46.171
Sixty days.

52:47.588 --> 52:49.088
[Trywell] Sixty to seventy.

52:50.421 --> 52:52.546
[Agnes] With a year till the next harvest.

52:53.463 --> 52:54.463
It's not enough.

52:55.338 --> 52:56.630
We have savings.

52:57.880 --> 52:58.880
Trywell.

52:59.880 --> 53:00.880
It's not enough.

53:07.630 --> 53:09.630
[hammering against metal]

53:16.505 --> 53:18.755
[speaking in Chichewa]

53:43.796 --> 53:45.916
[in Chichewa]
The government is denying a food crisis.

53:47.005 --> 53:48.005
What?

53:48.713 --> 53:52.005
- They won't admit it's happening.
- [man speaking in Chichewa on radio]

53:52.088 --> 53:54.046
<i>The corrupt government is only interested</i>

53:54.130 --> 53:56.213
<i>in securing victory
in the coming election.</i>

53:56.296 --> 53:59.671
<i>We demand assurances from our leadership.</i>

54:00.463 --> 54:03.838
<i>Tell us who will support our communities
when the food runs out?</i>

54:03.921 --> 54:05.713
[murmurs of protest in crowd]

54:08.380 --> 54:10.588
[indistinct arguing]

54:11.463 --> 54:13.838
There's an opposition rally in Nkhata Bay.

54:13.921 --> 54:15.963
- They're getting a truck.
- Another rally?

54:16.213 --> 54:18.588
The opposition can put pressure
on the government.

54:18.671 --> 54:22.421
- Where can we get the best price?
- I'll take care of it.

54:22.505 --> 54:24.171
- Uh-huh.
- [Agnes] You're going?

54:24.255 --> 54:25.088
[Annie] Papa!

54:25.171 --> 54:27.380
The government doesn't want us
to make noise.

54:27.463 --> 54:30.130
The opposition people need our support.

54:30.713 --> 54:34.380
Make noise here if you want to make noise.
Stay with your family.

54:34.630 --> 54:37.255
We'll be back tonight.
Tomorrow at the latest.

54:39.546 --> 54:42.213
We need to make sure
people know what's happening here.

54:42.546 --> 54:43.546
[mutters in Chichewa]

55:17.546 --> 55:20.386
[Mrs. Sikelo in English] So, you use
the windmill to charge the battery?

55:21.046 --> 55:22.546
And the battery powers a pump.

55:23.255 --> 55:26.213
We can plant in the dry season.
Two harvests.

55:26.880 --> 55:29.130
We can plant now
and we won't run out of food.

55:30.755 --> 55:33.046
With Mr. Kachigunda's dynamo, I can do it.

55:36.588 --> 55:37.588
Go to his class.

55:38.546 --> 55:39.546
Ask him.

55:41.755 --> 55:44.171
I don't want you staying
in this village anymore.

55:44.546 --> 55:46.296
Not with all of these problems.

55:47.630 --> 55:49.005
Where do you want me to go?

55:49.796 --> 55:51.130
I have people in Mangochi.

55:51.755 --> 55:55.213
We can travel there and marry.

56:00.921 --> 56:02.296
You want me to run away?

56:02.963 --> 56:04.921
You want me to disgrace my family?

56:05.005 --> 56:07.231
I love you. I don't know
what's more important than this.

56:07.255 --> 56:09.755
We can come back
when I can pay them a bride price.

56:09.838 --> 56:12.338
We'll do everything right then. I promise.

56:16.463 --> 56:18.296
Can you pay them a bride price now?

56:21.171 --> 56:22.671
There's no money for teachers.

56:23.755 --> 56:26.380
So many students are leaving
because of the harvest.

56:27.338 --> 56:28.671
They may close the school.

56:29.296 --> 56:32.171
There's nothing here for us.
There's nothing in Wimbe.

56:32.546 --> 56:33.546
Nothing for you.

56:35.296 --> 56:38.213
- You should go back to school.
- I don't care about school.

56:39.755 --> 56:41.880
We can leave now. I can arrange it. Annie.

56:42.713 --> 56:44.713
- Annie.
- How can I go to Mangochi?

56:45.380 --> 56:46.921
I can't even speak Yao.

56:47.880 --> 56:50.755
They speak English in Mangochi,
and you can learn Yao.

56:56.296 --> 56:59.338
[pupils murmuring indistinctly]

57:00.630 --> 57:03.921
[Mr. Ofesi] Class, I'll be taking
your science lesson this morning.

57:10.171 --> 57:11.296
William Kamkwamba.

57:13.713 --> 57:14.713
Stand up.

57:18.421 --> 57:19.505
My father will pay, sir.

57:19.838 --> 57:24.088
You are stealing from the family
of every remaining student in this school.

57:24.171 --> 57:25.380
My father will pay, sir.

57:25.463 --> 57:28.630
You're stealing from myself
and from every member of faculty.

57:29.171 --> 57:30.171
My father will pay.

57:30.296 --> 57:31.880
You're expelled from Kachokolo,

57:32.088 --> 57:34.338
and you will never be allowed
to study here again

57:34.505 --> 57:36.088
or any school in this district.

57:36.546 --> 57:39.005
- Collect your things and go.
- Mr. Ofesi.

57:39.713 --> 57:40.880
Collect your things and go!

57:53.505 --> 57:55.838
[Mr. Ofesi] <i>There's nothing
I can do about it, Mrs. Sikelo.</i>

57:55.963 --> 57:58.338
I cannot ignore him
sneaking into the school.

57:58.921 --> 58:02.255
But he was not sneaking into the school.

58:02.838 --> 58:04.088
Don't you see, Mr. Ofesi?

58:05.130 --> 58:08.463
Can you not see
that he's been sneaking out of the fields?

58:43.796 --> 58:45.755
[Agnes in Chichewa]
Have you seen your sister?

58:46.588 --> 58:47.588
No.

58:49.130 --> 58:50.630
They caught you at school?

58:52.588 --> 58:55.171
- You knew I was going?
- Of course.

58:57.921 --> 58:58.921
They expelled me.

58:59.880 --> 59:00.880
[Agnes] Oh!

59:01.380 --> 59:02.380
William.

59:04.046 --> 59:06.046
[people chattering, shouting]

59:14.880 --> 59:17.130
[Agnes calling out in Chichewa]

59:17.380 --> 59:20.880
- What's happening?
- They're taking grain to Chamama. To sell.

59:21.505 --> 59:23.130
[panting]

59:24.921 --> 59:27.880
It's a government truck.
They're not leaving us to starve.

59:28.671 --> 59:30.671
[people shouting]

59:39.380 --> 59:42.046
Buy grain. As much as you can.

59:42.380 --> 59:45.880
It's government price, not market price.
It's cheaper.

59:45.963 --> 59:47.546
Aah! No, take the bike.

59:48.796 --> 59:50.671
Take the bike. [panting]

59:53.671 --> 59:55.880
[shouts in English]
Khamba, stay! It's too far.

59:58.463 --> 59:59.921
- [dog barks]
- Khamba, stay.

01:00:24.671 --> 01:00:26.671
[people shouting in distance]

01:00:41.796 --> 01:00:45.546
[in Chichewa] Grain! Grain! Grain!

01:00:59.005 --> 01:01:01.755
[woman shouting indistinctly in Chichewa]

01:01:05.130 --> 01:01:06.130
[in Chichewa] Stop!

01:01:08.838 --> 01:01:09.838
Stop!

01:01:10.630 --> 01:01:11.630
Let's go back.

01:01:21.255 --> 01:01:22.713
[baby fussing]

01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:25.505
- [in Chichewa] Where were you?
- [Annie] Seeing a friend.

01:01:26.505 --> 01:01:27.588
Which friend?

01:01:28.505 --> 01:01:30.838
You think I don't see you
sneaking out of here?

01:01:31.255 --> 01:01:32.546
At night even?

01:01:33.255 --> 01:01:34.713
- I've told you...
- [Agnes] I know.

01:01:35.338 --> 01:01:36.338
What?

01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:38.463
There's no one for me in Wimbe.

01:01:39.338 --> 01:01:40.963
There's nothing for me in Wimbe.

01:01:41.130 --> 01:01:44.713
So if there's nothing for me in Wimbe,
why should I stay in Wimbe?

01:01:44.838 --> 01:01:45.880
How can I stay?

01:01:48.963 --> 01:01:50.255
[door slams]

01:02:03.921 --> 01:02:06.338
- Who are you going with?
- That's not what I'm saying.

01:02:06.921 --> 01:02:08.588
You want to disgrace your family?

01:02:10.255 --> 01:02:11.380
You don't understand.

01:02:12.046 --> 01:02:15.546
What do you think you know that I don't?

01:02:16.921 --> 01:02:17.921
[shrieks]

01:02:18.505 --> 01:02:20.505
[dishes clattering]

01:02:20.671 --> 01:02:22.671
Madam, I haven't eaten in two days.

01:02:23.005 --> 01:02:24.005
Get out.

01:02:25.088 --> 01:02:26.505
I don't want to hurt anyone.

01:02:30.130 --> 01:02:32.421
- They said to see the Chief...
- [baby crying]

01:02:37.171 --> 01:02:38.171
but he's dying.

01:02:45.130 --> 01:02:46.546

01:02:58.963 --> 01:03:00.546

01:03:04.921 --> 01:03:09.546
[Agnes screaming in Chichewa]

01:03:12.380 --> 01:03:13.546
[screams]

01:03:14.671 --> 01:03:17.921
[Agnes sobbing]

01:03:36.463 --> 01:03:38.713
[people chattering in Chichewa]

01:03:59.921 --> 01:04:02.481
[in Chichewa] How much can they have?
There were only two trucks.

01:04:02.630 --> 01:04:04.630
[people shouting]

01:04:43.713 --> 01:04:45.921
[man in Chichewa] Back in line!
Back in line!

01:04:46.005 --> 01:04:49.171
[man continues shouting orders

01:05:10.338 --> 01:05:12.255

[soldiers speaking in Chichewa]

01:06:07.546 --> 01:06:11.046
There will not be enough
for everyone today.

01:06:11.380 --> 01:06:13.671
[overlapping shouts]

01:06:39.713 --> 01:06:41.421
I can only give you fifteen kilos.

01:06:56.838 --> 01:06:58.671
[shouts continue from outside]

01:06:58.755 --> 01:07:01.588
[people pounding
on metal paneling outside]

01:07:27.713 --> 01:07:29.713
[speaking indistinctly in Chichewa]

[calling out in Chichewa]

01:07:39.505 --> 01:07:41.046
[vehicle honks in distance]

01:07:45.755 --> 01:07:48.338
[Agnes] Trywell! Trywell!

01:07:49.838 --> 01:07:51.838
[in Chichewa] I told you not to go!

01:07:52.255 --> 01:07:54.338
- What happened?
- I told you not to go!

01:07:56.088 --> 01:07:58.213
- I told you not to go!
- [Trywell] Where's William?

01:07:58.296 --> 01:07:59.338
[Agnes] I don't know.

01:07:59.421 --> 01:08:01.255
[Trywell] William! Where's William?

01:08:01.546 --> 01:08:03.546
[shouts continue outside]

01:08:06.463 --> 01:08:08.463
[baby fussing]

01:08:15.505 --> 01:08:18.305
[man in Chichewa] We can't just stay here.
We'll need to open the door.

01:08:18.380 --> 01:08:19.546
You'll have to run.

01:08:19.921 --> 01:08:21.546
[murmurs of protest]

01:08:34.046 --> 01:08:35.046
Sir.

01:08:35.171 --> 01:08:36.171
Can you help me?

01:08:38.462 --> 01:08:39.462
Please.

01:09:13.712 --> 01:09:14.712
[Trywell sighs]

01:09:19.796 --> 01:09:22.212
[in Chichewa] We can have one meal a day.

01:09:28.671 --> 01:09:30.380
We should decide which one.

01:09:30.962 --> 01:09:31.962
[Annie scoffs]

01:09:33.130 --> 01:09:34.130
This is crazy.

01:09:42.337 --> 01:09:43.337
Agnes?

01:09:47.546 --> 01:09:48.880
Supper.

01:09:50.130 --> 01:09:52.712
You can't sleep on an empty stomach.

01:09:58.671 --> 01:09:59.671
William?

01:10:02.338 --> 01:10:03.338
Breakfast.

01:10:04.296 --> 01:10:05.296
Why?

01:10:06.671 --> 01:10:08.130
I like breakfast.

01:10:09.255 --> 01:10:11.463
- My God!
- Annie!

01:10:14.796 --> 01:10:16.476
You don't raise your voice to your father.

01:10:16.505 --> 01:10:17.796
He left us here.

01:10:17.963 --> 01:10:20.796
We could have been raped and killed.
If it wasn't for William...

01:10:21.296 --> 01:10:22.296
[gasps, cries out]

01:10:29.130 --> 01:10:30.130
[sobs]

01:10:31.130 --> 01:10:34.755
Your father was trying to save us.

01:10:35.546 --> 01:10:37.588
- There's no food!
- And so?

01:10:39.713 --> 01:10:41.963
You think I'd let you starve to death?

01:10:45.296 --> 01:10:47.796
When I cut off my own arm to feed you,

01:10:49.421 --> 01:10:51.338
then you'll know that you're my child.

01:11:10.421 --> 01:11:11.963
[sobbing]

01:11:19.046 --> 01:11:21.046
[Trywell grunting]

01:12:01.505 --> 01:12:02.630
[grunting]

01:12:14.796 --> 01:12:15.796
[grunts]

01:12:30.130 --> 01:12:31.171
[mutters in Chichewa]

01:12:35.171 --> 01:12:39.421
Tomorrow,
we'll dig ridges and start planting.

01:12:40.838 --> 01:12:43.130
[man] The ground is too hard.
It's the dry season.

01:12:43.338 --> 01:12:45.046
Nothing will grow.

01:12:47.630 --> 01:12:48.630
[Trywell] Then...

01:12:49.796 --> 01:12:51.088
we pray for rain.

01:12:52.755 --> 01:12:54.255
Dear Father,

01:12:56.088 --> 01:12:57.380
fight for this family.

01:12:58.338 --> 01:13:00.338
- Bring us rain in this dry season...
- Trywell.

01:13:00.796 --> 01:13:01.796
Stop.

01:13:10.588 --> 01:13:12.338
Eat, Papa.

01:13:18.130 --> 01:13:19.171
[sighs]

01:13:39.671 --> 01:13:42.463
If you give any food to that dog,

01:13:43.338 --> 01:13:44.546
I'll break your neck.

01:13:55.005 --> 01:13:56.546
[softly] Annie. Annie.

01:13:58.671 --> 01:14:01.630
- What is it?
- I need you to speak to Mr. Kachigunda.

01:14:07.088 --> 01:14:08.796
I know you're talking to Mr. Kachigunda.

01:14:09.213 --> 01:14:11.213
I need to use the dynamo from his bike.

01:14:12.213 --> 01:14:14.213
- The dynamo?
- You have to help me, Annie.

01:14:15.171 --> 01:14:17.255
Tell him he has to let me use the dynamo.

01:14:17.338 --> 01:14:19.546
I can fix a water pump.
I know how to do it.

01:14:19.963 --> 01:14:21.880
I can bring water. I can make rain.

01:14:23.630 --> 01:14:24.755
But I need the dynamo.

01:14:44.921 --> 01:14:47.130
[gentle song playing]

01:15:02.005 --> 01:15:04.630
[woman singing in Chichewa]

01:15:36.213 --> 01:15:37.255
[fly buzzing]

01:15:42.421 --> 01:15:45.088
[Trywell and Agnes shouting in Chichewa]

01:15:53.921 --> 01:15:55.630
[in Chichewa] Mama, what happened?

01:15:56.713 --> 01:15:58.463
[sobbing] She's gone with teacher.

01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:00.796
Did you see her? Did you see her?

01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:01.880
[William] No, sir.

01:16:02.713 --> 01:16:03.713
Are you lying to me?

01:16:04.463 --> 01:16:06.671
- Where did they go?
- I don't know, sir.

01:16:07.963 --> 01:16:09.713
Bring me my daughter, William.

01:16:09.921 --> 01:16:12.880
- I don't know, sir. I don't know!
- Bring me my daughter!

01:16:13.546 --> 01:16:14.796
[in English] "One less."

01:16:16.213 --> 01:16:18.046
She says, "One less."

01:16:19.588 --> 01:16:23.088
"One less mouth to feed."

01:16:37.338 --> 01:16:40.296
[in English] I'll do everything I can
to find an address, but right now...

01:16:40.380 --> 01:16:42.796
We have no money to go to Mangochi.

01:16:45.463 --> 01:16:48.671
I'll do my best to locate Mr. Kachigunda.

01:16:49.796 --> 01:16:50.796
Your best?

01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:53.463
I'm sorry, we're closing the school
for the moment.

01:16:54.505 --> 01:16:56.755
There are not enough students or teachers.

01:16:58.380 --> 01:17:00.963
- Is Ms. Sikelo still here?
- No.

01:17:02.838 --> 01:17:05.921
This hunger will be the last one,

01:17:07.421 --> 01:17:09.630
for me and my family, believe me.

01:17:12.130 --> 01:17:14.421
We'll never go through
something like this again.

01:17:15.880 --> 01:17:17.546
[Agnes] He's starving himself.

01:17:19.130 --> 01:17:20.421
Killing himself.

01:17:21.546 --> 01:17:24.796
So he doesn't take food
from these children.

01:17:25.505 --> 01:17:26.338
Mrs. Kamkwamba...

01:17:26.421 --> 01:17:28.880
When we were first married,
we promised each other

01:17:30.380 --> 01:17:34.421
that we would never pray for rain
like our ancestors.

01:17:34.796 --> 01:17:36.505
We said we were modern people,

01:17:37.463 --> 01:17:39.296
and our children would go to school.

01:17:40.171 --> 01:17:43.671
And this is here that Annie met teacher,

01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:45.880
and we paid for it.

01:17:47.713 --> 01:17:51.088
- And you even expelled my son.
- Not me, Mrs. Kamkwamba.

01:17:51.588 --> 01:17:53.421
- The government...
- Which government?

01:17:55.880 --> 01:17:57.671
The government that beat our chief?

01:17:59.213 --> 01:18:00.213
[baby fussing]

01:18:00.755 --> 01:18:05.088
Even if they prayed for rain,
the ancestors survived

01:18:06.130 --> 01:18:07.588
because they stayed together.

01:18:09.671 --> 01:18:11.838
[baby whimpering, crying]

01:18:19.005 --> 01:18:21.213
When do we stay together, Mr. Headmaster?

01:18:26.921 --> 01:18:28.921
What can I do, Mrs. Kamkwamba?

01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:40.338
Can I use the library?

01:18:52.588 --> 01:18:53.838
[in Chichewa] What's all this?

01:18:54.255 --> 01:18:55.380
[in English] An experiment.

01:18:57.130 --> 01:19:00.213
In America, electricity made from wind.

01:19:01.005 --> 01:19:02.965
[in Chichewa]
With electricity, we can make water.

01:19:03.463 --> 01:19:05.022
[in English]
We're going to build a windmill.

01:19:05.046 --> 01:19:07.713
We need to build a small one first,
to see if it works.

01:19:07.796 --> 01:19:10.421
[in Chichewa]
All I ate today was pigskin from the drum.

01:19:11.671 --> 01:19:12.963
Don't waste my time.

01:19:15.130 --> 01:19:16.171
What do we do?

01:19:31.630 --> 01:19:34.171
It has a motor inside.
[in English] It turns the cassette tape.

01:19:34.921 --> 01:19:36.881
[in Chichewa]
How are you doing with those blades?

01:19:36.963 --> 01:19:38.463
[man in Chichewa] I'm almost there.

01:19:56.838 --> 01:19:58.546
[in Chichewa] Okay, open the door.

01:20:00.921 --> 01:20:02.921
[wind blowing]

01:21:12.296 --> 01:21:13.505
[William in Chichewa] Papa.

01:21:15.421 --> 01:21:16.921
I want to show you something.

01:21:38.255 --> 01:21:40.255
[indistinct radio chatter]

01:21:41.671 --> 01:21:43.046
Can you hear it?

01:21:47.963 --> 01:21:48.963
Uh-huh.

01:21:50.588 --> 01:21:51.588
What is it?

01:21:52.755 --> 01:21:54.088
It's wind energy.

01:21:54.838 --> 01:21:57.130
The blades make electricity,

01:21:57.796 --> 01:21:59.130
and that powers the radio.

01:22:01.796 --> 01:22:02.796
I see.

01:22:03.255 --> 01:22:09.171
I want to build a big one.
A big one could power a water pump.

01:22:09.796 --> 01:22:12.213
It means that even if the land is dry,

01:22:13.213 --> 01:22:16.838
we can still plant.

01:22:20.338 --> 01:22:21.338
It can do that?

01:22:23.005 --> 01:22:24.005
Yes.

01:22:25.088 --> 01:22:27.380
But to build a big one,

01:22:27.755 --> 01:22:29.921
I'll need something
to help turn the blades.

01:22:32.963 --> 01:22:35.838
If I could use your bike, it would work.

01:22:40.796 --> 01:22:41.796
The bike?

01:22:43.046 --> 01:22:44.505
It would work.

01:22:49.421 --> 01:22:50.880
How long would you need it for?

01:22:53.671 --> 01:22:57.338
I'd need to remove the wheels
and cut the frame.

01:22:57.671 --> 01:23:00.171
You couldn't use it as a bike anymore.

01:23:04.630 --> 01:23:05.630
What?

01:23:11.255 --> 01:23:12.255
William.

01:23:15.171 --> 01:23:17.171
Have you seen what's happening, William?

01:23:18.213 --> 01:23:19.213
Yes, sir.

01:23:20.463 --> 01:23:24.130
- People are dying. Do you understand?
- This will help everyone.

01:23:26.088 --> 01:23:27.921
Get this stupidness away from me.

01:23:28.630 --> 01:23:31.671
- Papa...
- Get this stupidness away from me!

01:23:32.796 --> 01:23:36.463
Papa, I need to take the bike
so I can bring electricity.

01:23:36.921 --> 01:23:39.630
With electricity, I can make water.
I can make rain.

01:23:39.713 --> 01:23:40.838
Are you still talking?

01:23:43.421 --> 01:23:46.671
There are things I know
that you don't know.

01:23:52.546 --> 01:23:54.796
Because you can make toys?

01:23:59.505 --> 01:24:01.005
Because of school.

01:24:05.213 --> 01:24:09.130
From now on, you get up with me
first thing in the morning, understand?

01:24:09.838 --> 01:24:12.088
You help me build these ridges.

01:24:12.338 --> 01:24:16.171
Forget about school!
Forget about the library!

01:24:16.338 --> 01:24:18.963
I don't want to see you
near this foolishness again!

01:24:19.671 --> 01:24:20.713
I was wrong!

01:24:22.296 --> 01:24:26.921
It's damn well time
you learned how to farm!

01:24:27.213 --> 01:24:28.213
Plow the land!

01:24:30.880 --> 01:24:32.046
Plow the land!

01:25:22.421 --> 01:25:24.546
- [in English] Are you okay?
- It's too hot.

01:25:26.255 --> 01:25:27.255
Look at the sky.

01:25:28.921 --> 01:25:31.755
It won't rain. It won't rain for months.

01:25:36.130 --> 01:25:39.050
[in Chichewa] Do you think the Gule
Wamkulu will come when my father dies?

01:25:40.005 --> 01:25:41.463
Even though there's a hunger?

01:25:44.338 --> 01:25:46.463
They're supposed to come
when a chief dies.

01:26:09.963 --> 01:26:12.088
- Let's go.
- Where?

01:26:16.838 --> 01:26:18.255
[in Chichewa] What's happening?

01:26:18.880 --> 01:26:22.046
We have to go north while we still can.
There's nothing left.

01:26:22.338 --> 01:26:23.713
I need your help.

01:26:24.171 --> 01:26:26.130
- [in English] If we stay, we die.
- No.

01:26:27.088 --> 01:26:29.213
We find another bike
and we build the windmill.

01:26:29.296 --> 01:26:31.171
[in Chichewa]
You're mad. A bike from where?

01:26:31.421 --> 01:26:34.963
There's no one in the trading center.
Everyone is leaving the village.

01:26:35.046 --> 01:26:39.046
- [in English] It was a toy, William.
- It's not a toy. I showed you.

01:26:39.796 --> 01:26:41.880
[in Chichewa]
What if there's no food in the north?

01:26:44.505 --> 01:26:45.630
[in English] You'll die.

01:26:47.213 --> 01:26:49.213
[in Chichewa]
If you're sure it will work, William,

01:26:49.546 --> 01:26:51.421
why don't you just take
your father's bike?

01:26:52.255 --> 01:26:53.630
Why don't you just take it?

01:27:12.796 --> 01:27:13.796
Papa.

01:27:28.880 --> 01:27:30.005
[in Chichewa] What's this?

01:27:31.546 --> 01:27:33.130
We need to take the bike, Papa.

01:27:40.755 --> 01:27:42.130
[in English] You want to fight me?

01:27:42.671 --> 01:27:46.588
We don't want to fight you, Trywell.
We just want you to give William the bike.

01:27:49.296 --> 01:27:50.296
William.

01:27:57.796 --> 01:27:58.880
Get away from my house.

01:27:59.296 --> 01:28:00.838
- He can bring water.
- You say.

01:28:01.338 --> 01:28:02.755
[in Chichewa] I can bring water.

01:28:03.463 --> 01:28:06.130
- All year round.
- You're a big man now, huh?

01:28:09.546 --> 01:28:10.546
[in English] Big men.

01:28:13.630 --> 01:28:14.630
Fight me.

01:28:19.588 --> 01:28:20.755
[in Chichewa] Do it!

01:28:32.921 --> 01:28:34.005
I'm your father!

01:28:36.338 --> 01:28:37.588
I'm your father!

01:28:48.421 --> 01:28:49.546
[William in English] Wait.

01:28:51.005 --> 01:28:52.963
[in Chichewa]
Come with us, William. Let's leave.

01:28:59.046 --> 01:29:00.213
[William in English] I can't.

01:29:09.005 --> 01:29:10.005
I have to go home.

01:29:11.213 --> 01:29:12.630
I need to be with my father.

01:29:35.171 --> 01:29:37.171
[wind howling]

01:30:20.630 --> 01:30:21.671
[in English] Khamba, come.

01:30:31.338 --> 01:30:32.338
Khamba.

01:30:45.046 --> 01:30:46.130
[voice trembles] Khamba.

01:31:29.671 --> 01:31:30.755
[footsteps]

01:31:41.505 --> 01:31:43.796
[Trywell in Chichewa]
<i>He tried to fight me,</i>

01:31:44.838 --> 01:31:45.838
with his friends,

01:31:46.671 --> 01:31:48.255
for the bike.

01:31:49.630 --> 01:31:50.963
Will you give it to him?

01:31:52.755 --> 01:31:53.880
Of course not.

01:32:14.963 --> 01:32:16.963
How much should I lose, Trywell?

01:32:20.171 --> 01:32:21.171
Huh?

01:32:22.796 --> 01:32:24.713
Everywhere I followed you,

01:32:25.796 --> 01:32:26.838
I lost something.

01:32:29.338 --> 01:32:30.338
My parents,

01:32:31.463 --> 01:32:32.880
when I came here.

01:32:35.296 --> 01:32:36.296
Then the land.

01:32:39.255 --> 01:32:40.296
Then we lost Annie.

01:32:43.505 --> 01:32:44.588
You're blaming me?

01:32:47.880 --> 01:32:50.046
I'm not blaming you.

01:32:52.671 --> 01:32:53.671
I'm asking you.

01:32:56.338 --> 01:32:59.421
When do we stop losing?

01:33:02.213 --> 01:33:04.046
Nothing we have done has worked.

01:33:58.588 --> 01:34:00.588
[bike rattling in distance]

01:34:24.046 --> 01:34:25.963
[in Chichewa] John said we'd grow tobacco.

01:34:29.255 --> 01:34:33.296
Tobacco that looked like milk chocolate,

01:34:35.713 --> 01:34:37.338
for 2,000 kwacha a kilo.

01:34:37.463 --> 01:34:38.463
[chuckles]

01:34:41.005 --> 01:34:42.005
I'm sorry, Papa.

01:34:43.963 --> 01:34:45.255
Sometimes it's dreams,

01:34:47.630 --> 01:34:49.588
and sometimes it's just lies.

01:34:52.005 --> 01:34:53.463
It's not a dream, Papa.

01:34:56.713 --> 01:34:58.046
I'm not dreaming.

01:35:03.046 --> 01:35:05.505
That's why he didn't leave the land to me.

01:35:09.255 --> 01:35:10.671
He didn't trust me.

01:35:12.005 --> 01:35:13.005
He never did.

01:35:15.630 --> 01:35:18.588
He knew I'd fail.

01:35:20.380 --> 01:35:21.921
Like I have.

01:35:24.630 --> 01:35:27.588
You didn't fail me. Never.

01:35:29.171 --> 01:35:30.296
I went to school.

01:35:43.671 --> 01:35:44.713
Water?

01:35:46.296 --> 01:35:47.296
Yes, sir.

01:35:51.338 --> 01:35:52.338
From wind?

01:35:54.713 --> 01:35:55.921
It can work,

01:35:58.005 --> 01:35:59.421
if you help me.

01:36:11.088 --> 01:36:12.088
Okay.

01:36:26.046 --> 01:36:27.421
[metal part clanging]

01:37:00.005 --> 01:37:01.630
[all grunting]

01:37:08.880 --> 01:37:10.880
[indistinct chatter in Chichewa]

01:37:43.421 --> 01:37:45.171
[in English]
You can bring it up. I'm ready.

01:38:00.505 --> 01:38:02.025
[Trywell in Chichewa] Have you got it?

01:38:09.505 --> 01:38:10.630
Be careful, William.

01:38:43.505 --> 01:38:45.505
[squeaking]

01:39:42.755 --> 01:39:45.171
[in English] It needs to charge.
The battery needs to charge.

01:40:24.921 --> 01:40:26.838
[steady clicking]

01:40:31.005 --> 01:40:32.255
[water sputters in hose]

01:40:44.005 --> 01:40:46.213
[screams]

01:40:46.338 --> 01:40:48.338
[laughter, excited chatter]

01:41:02.421 --> 01:41:04.421
[indistinct chatter in Chichewa]

01:41:05.838 --> 01:41:10.338
[in Chichewa] Go to the chief's house
and bring seeds. We'll plant vegetables.

01:41:17.546 --> 01:41:20.671
We'll get through
while we wait for the grain to grow.

01:42:38.713 --> 01:42:40.713
[bugs chirring]

01:42:58.671 --> 01:43:00.963
[man singing Islamic call to prayer]

01:43:15.255 --> 01:43:17.255
[man praying in Arabic]

01:43:25.713 --> 01:43:28.005
[drums thudding]

01:43:28.088 --> 01:43:30.296
- [people chanting]
- [metallic jangling]

01:43:35.546 --> 01:43:37.546
[drumming and chanting continue]

01:43:41.963 --> 01:43:43.338
[in English] Go to them, Gilbert.

01:44:30.296 --> 01:44:33.463
[in Chichewa] Mrs. Sikelo wants to bring
the new government's representative

01:44:34.046 --> 01:44:36.255
for the schools district
to see the windmill.

01:44:38.463 --> 01:44:41.380
She says there may be a scholarship
for a school in Madisi.

01:44:44.921 --> 01:44:47.546
I think I should stay here.

01:44:48.796 --> 01:44:52.421
At least till Annie comes back.

01:44:53.088 --> 01:44:55.588
I think I should stay
and help you with the land.

01:45:01.755 --> 01:45:04.005
I've been thinking about this machine,
William.

01:45:06.588 --> 01:45:09.088
I've been thinking about
how it will carry you away

01:45:09.171 --> 01:45:10.921
and keep you here at the same time.

01:45:13.005 --> 01:45:15.755
Because no one can see this thing
and not think of you.

01:45:17.338 --> 01:45:19.463
No one would want to.

01:45:21.921 --> 01:45:23.380
Wherever you are.

01:45:30.421 --> 01:45:31.421
Go to school.

01:47:23.005 --> 01:47:25.630
