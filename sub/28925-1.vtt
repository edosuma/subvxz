00:17.208 --> 00:19.416
How do I look? Is this good?

00:19.416 --> 00:21.708
- Do you want me to go left, or...
- Wait, wait. Hold on...

00:27.416 --> 00:29.666
- Am I good here?
- Yeah, you're good.

00:30.583 --> 00:31.583
Okay.

00:32.458 --> 00:33.375
Roll!

00:33.458 --> 00:34.458
Okay! So,

00:34.708 --> 00:36.125
This here is an American ship.

00:36.208 --> 00:40.041
Landed on these shores right here to
liberate France from 'ze Germans'.

00:40.125 --> 00:43.541
My father's battalion,
or whatever it's called

00:43.541 --> 00:46.500
actually landed 20 kilometers
east of here in Saint-Tropez,

00:46.500 --> 00:48.291
but they didn't get a fancy little boat.

00:49.500 --> 00:50.500
Wait a minute.

00:50.708 --> 00:53.500
I thought it was your mother who was
American and your father was French.

00:53.541 --> 00:54.333
Yeah.

00:55.541 --> 00:58.083
So your French father landed in
France, by boat?

00:58.833 --> 00:59.958
Yeah. He was from Dahomey.

01:00.000 --> 01:00.916
Born and raised.

01:01.958 --> 01:03.458
Dahomey, as in Benin?

01:03.500 --> 01:04.625
Yeah. As in Benin.

01:05.208 --> 01:06.333
So he was African.

01:07.291 --> 01:09.625
No, he wasn't African. He was French.

01:10.208 --> 01:11.208
Dahomey...

01:13.000 --> 01:14.958
or Benin as it used to be called,

01:15.083 --> 01:16.083
was France.

01:16.458 --> 01:19.750
So my father, as a result of being
born and raised there,

01:19.833 --> 01:20.833
was French.

01:21.833 --> 01:22.416
Right.

01:23.583 --> 01:26.875
But there are still Beninese people
in existence today, right?

01:26.916 --> 01:27.916
Yeah, so?

01:28.583 --> 01:29.250
So,

01:30.250 --> 01:33.833
why does your French father
get to be French,

01:33.833 --> 01:35.458
when he was born in Africa

01:35.458 --> 01:39.708
when African French-born
people are still African?

01:41.500 --> 01:43.958
Zuhair, you want to help or something?
- Hmm?

01:44.166 --> 01:45.750
I don't know how else to explain this.

01:46.833 --> 01:47.458
Okay.

01:48.458 --> 01:49.625
I'm from India, right?

01:50.083 --> 01:50.750
Sure.

01:51.333 --> 01:53.083
And India was a British colony.

01:53.083 --> 01:53.666
Right.

01:54.500 --> 01:56.500
So that doesn't make my ancestors British!

01:59.041 --> 02:01.625
I get the concept.
I don't need it explained to me.

02:01.791 --> 02:02.791
I want to know...

02:03.958 --> 02:07.291
I want to hear you explain it,
from your perspective.

02:08.541 --> 02:09.250
Okay.

02:09.750 --> 02:11.416
Do I look African to you?

02:11.708 --> 02:12.416
No you don't.

02:12.583 --> 02:13.416
Exactly!

02:13.750 --> 02:14.583
Exactly.

02:19.041 --> 02:20.166
Okay. Moving on.

02:20.375 --> 02:21.250
All right!

02:27.291 --> 02:29.625
We're going to start down here
in Saint-Raphaël

02:29.625 --> 02:31.416
We're going to knock out all the war stuff.

02:31.416 --> 02:33.166
Lots of memorabilia to go through.

02:33.291 --> 02:35.583
Then we'll grab the keys
from the estate lawyer

02:35.583 --> 02:37.541
for the Paris apartment,
his work apartment.

02:37.541 --> 02:40.291
And we'll actually follow the path
that my dad took up to Paris

02:40.333 --> 02:42.125
to liberate it from the Germans.

02:42.125 --> 02:45.291
There's a lot of post-war stuff,
private-sector stuff

02:45.291 --> 02:46.291
to go through there, too.

02:47.083 --> 02:49.541
I'm going to be completely honest, man...

02:53.416 --> 02:57.416
I've got five minutes to sell
the studio to a film.

02:58.250 --> 03:00.583
You know, a guy goes to war,

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
a guy gets money after the war,

03:03.000 --> 03:04.250
is not really a film.

03:04.250 --> 03:06.250
A lot of guys did that after World War 2.

03:06.458 --> 03:11.500
Okay. I clearly haven't
done my dad justice yet,

03:11.500 --> 03:12.916
but it is only day one,

03:13.666 --> 03:16.583
and there's a lot more for me to show you.

03:18.875 --> 03:23.333
I'm hearing Saint Raphaël,
I'm hearing Paris.

03:25.833 --> 03:26.708
Vic?

03:27.291 --> 03:30.041
Tell him he's in the
Who's Who of France, as well.

03:30.416 --> 03:31.416
Oh, yeah! I forgot.

03:32.500 --> 03:34.166
I've got the book up here.
I'll show it to you.

03:34.166 --> 03:36.000
My dad is in the Who's Who of France.

03:36.208 --> 03:38.208
I mean, there is more to it that just

03:38.875 --> 03:41.291
dude who went to war and made money.

04:05.208 --> 04:06.708
Morning, Victor.

04:10.625 --> 04:11.625
Shhh!

04:11.625 --> 04:12.625
Sorry.

04:13.416 --> 04:15.166
What are we shhh-ing about?

04:15.291 --> 04:17.083
I saw a weird animal a few minutes ago.

04:17.083 --> 04:18.166
I'm trying to get it to come back.

04:18.166 --> 04:19.166
What kind of animal?

04:19.666 --> 04:21.125
It was brown...

04:21.291 --> 04:22.291
furry, and...

04:22.458 --> 04:23.458
It was like... You know what?

04:23.458 --> 04:26.250
It was like a snake mated a cat!

04:27.500 --> 04:28.500
Oh!

04:28.500 --> 04:29.500
A stoat.

04:29.708 --> 04:30.458
A what?

04:30.916 --> 04:32.750
A stoat. It's like a weasel.

04:32.750 --> 04:34.041
Yeah! It looked like a weasel.

04:38.666 --> 04:40.125
They go white in the winter.

04:40.125 --> 04:42.541
It's what the kings
make their robes out of.

04:42.541 --> 04:45.125
It's actually a bad omen
to see them in the summer.

04:45.458 --> 04:47.250
What do you mean, it's a bad omen?

04:47.250 --> 04:48.875
I've got to run to the bakery.

04:49.166 --> 04:50.166
Pick up some stuff.

04:51.666 --> 04:53.458
What do you mean, it's a bad omen?

04:59.708 --> 05:01.958
Do you mind holding these?

05:52.083 --> 05:53.458
Uhhh... My head.

05:54.291 --> 05:55.291
What's up?

05:55.833 --> 05:59.041
I have to make a quick stop
at my mom's nursing home.

05:59.708 --> 06:01.375
You don't mind waiting in the car, do you?

06:06.875 --> 06:08.291
Are you all right, Vic?

06:09.583 --> 06:11.458
Yeah. I'm all right.

06:15.375 --> 06:16.875
Must be tough, huh?

06:21.458 --> 06:23.083
What, exactly?

06:24.583 --> 06:28.000
- Going to the home when she's not there.
- Oh.

06:28.791 --> 06:30.625
Yeah, I guess.

06:35.541 --> 06:37.416
Do you miss her a lot?

06:43.708 --> 06:47.708
It's been so long since
I've talked to her...

06:48.208 --> 06:51.333
I was twelve when...

06:52.458 --> 06:55.458
Yeah, I guess I miss her.

06:56.166 --> 06:59.916
That's probably the answer
you want me to say, right?

07:00.916 --> 07:02.666
That's what I'm supposed to feel?

08:00.208 --> 08:01.666
Just keep following the trail

08:01.666 --> 08:03.166
You'll get there eventually.

08:14.583 --> 08:16.000
There's no way ahead!

08:16.125 --> 08:17.916
There is. You have to look down.

08:17.916 --> 08:19.625
They are actually wild boar trails.

08:20.875 --> 08:22.333
As tall as a boar.

08:26.625 --> 08:27.875
There you go!

08:35.957 --> 08:38.625
You might want to put that
backpack on your chest.

08:38.875 --> 08:41.166
So it's not high when you're ducking.

08:41.375 --> 08:43.375
- Yeah.
- To protect your abdomen.

08:45.750 --> 08:48.416
I told you guys I knew where I was going.

08:50.458 --> 08:52.125
This was our favorite spot.

08:52.250 --> 08:53.333
Wow!

08:53.583 --> 08:55.041
This is beautiful!

08:55.500 --> 08:57.458
Um, Zuhair.

08:57.666 --> 08:59.583
I know this is not principle photography,

08:59.583 --> 09:01.583
but when you're behind the camera,
you really shouldn't talk.

09:11.166 --> 09:16.333
So, what is the significance
of this pond to your father?

09:16.541 --> 09:18.083
This pond is a mine.

09:18.291 --> 09:22.583
It was one of the first mines
my father ran after the war.

09:23.750 --> 09:25.083
This is a mine?

09:25.250 --> 09:25.750
Yup!

09:25.833 --> 09:28.041
Actually, when it stopped producing,

09:28.041 --> 09:31.333
he blasted into the groundwater
so it would fill up,

09:31.333 --> 09:33.125
and that makes it a lot more safe

09:33.791 --> 09:36.166
Infact, all of this was ours.

09:36.166 --> 09:38.625
Everything we walked through, at one point.

09:39.208 --> 09:41.958
He sold it off after the
mines stopped producing

09:41.958 --> 09:44.166
and kept just a small plot
to build the house on.

09:45.375 --> 09:47.375
So, when you say that your grandfather

09:47.375 --> 09:49.250
was buddying up with African dictators

09:49.250 --> 09:52.583
you really meant that
he was mining in Africa?

09:52.583 --> 09:54.750
Yes. That was a little bit later,

09:54.750 --> 09:58.166
when France's energy platform
involved a lot of uranium.

09:59.458 --> 10:00.541
But why mining?

10:01.166 --> 10:01.833
Well...

10:02.416 --> 10:05.708
My family comes from a long line of miners

10:05.708 --> 10:06.833
my father,

10:06.833 --> 10:09.625
his father before that,
and his father before that.

10:09.708 --> 10:13.250
They all made their fortunes
mining French West Africa.

10:14.916 --> 10:16.708
But after the war, your...

10:17.333 --> 10:19.750
But after the war he
decided to stay in France.

10:19.750 --> 10:20.750
Why is that?

10:22.666 --> 10:24.916
That's a sad story, actually.

10:25.833 --> 10:27.875
There was this nationalist douchebag

10:27.875 --> 10:30.666
that started riling up all the miners

10:30.666 --> 10:33.750
and convincing them
that they could renegotiate ownership.

10:34.000 --> 10:37.083
So, they gave my grandfather
an ultimatum and said,

10:37.083 --> 10:38.708
that he could keep the land,

10:38.708 --> 10:40.625
but he'd now be renting it out to them

10:40.625 --> 10:42.583
and they would own everything
they pull out of the mountains.

10:42.583 --> 10:43.583
Can you believe that shit?

10:44.875 --> 10:46.666
Yeah, I sort of can.

10:47.291 --> 10:48.458
You think that's fair?

10:49.375 --> 10:52.291
Well, I guess it depends on how
your family came across the lands

10:52.291 --> 10:54.458
that they were mining in the first place.

10:57.541 --> 10:59.458
I don't really see how
that factors into it.

11:00.458 --> 11:01.458
They didn't have a claim over it.

11:01.458 --> 11:03.375
It's not like the miners
had a claim over it.

11:04.291 --> 11:05.541
They can't just steal it.

11:06.083 --> 11:07.291
They were African, right?

11:07.583 --> 11:08.375
In Africa?

11:09.083 --> 11:10.125
The miners were African?

11:10.291 --> 11:10.833
Yes.

11:11.708 --> 11:13.875
So, I think the arguments would be that

11:14.583 --> 11:17.208
Your family stole the land from them

11:17.333 --> 11:19.875
and they were taking back
what was rightfully theirs.

11:20.583 --> 11:22.416
I don't know why you always
have to spin it like that.

11:22.541 --> 11:24.000
- My family was well...
- I'm not spinning it.

11:24.083 --> 11:27.666
My family was well-liked by the miners
before this guy came along.

11:27.833 --> 11:29.041
Zuhair, you'll like this.

11:29.125 --> 11:31.416
My grandfather instituted a program

11:31.458 --> 11:34.666
where the Muslim miners, if they
worked for the family for ten years,

11:34.666 --> 11:36.833
would have their Hajj
trip to Mecca paid for.

11:40.750 --> 11:42.333
'Arbeit macht frei'

11:43.166 --> 11:44.333
What's that supposed to mean?

11:44.708 --> 11:46.916
It's German for 'work makes you free'.

11:46.958 --> 11:48.750
I know what it translates to.

11:48.750 --> 11:50.458
It's written on the gates of Auschwitz.

11:50.458 --> 11:52.291
I get that. I live in Berlin.

11:52.291 --> 11:54.708
I'm asking you what you mean by it.

11:54.958 --> 11:57.416
I mean, if your grandfather
was such a nice guy,

11:57.416 --> 12:00.833
he would have paid your workers enough

12:00.833 --> 12:03.541
for them to afford their own trip to Mecca.

12:04.625 --> 12:05.791
You know, Dorian?

12:05.791 --> 12:09.375
Just because you're black doesn't mean you
get to adopt the entire African struggle.

12:09.541 --> 12:11.000
Hold on, man. Slow down.

12:13.208 --> 12:14.416
Just slow down.

12:15.791 --> 12:17.291
No, but really, Dorian.

12:17.625 --> 12:20.416
The Beninese struggle has nothing to do
with what your people went through.

12:20.416 --> 12:20.958
Nothing.

12:20.958 --> 12:24.250
Look. You're forgetting something
that's key, Victor.

12:24.708 --> 12:26.333
- What's that?
- I'm half Vietnamese.

12:26.708 --> 12:29.000
They were under French
colonization as well.

12:29.666 --> 12:31.458
You think that was any kind of picnic?

12:31.583 --> 12:32.791
Switch out your tampon.

12:34.666 --> 12:35.666
Zuhair,

12:36.458 --> 12:39.708
you're from a country
that was once under colonial rule.

12:39.708 --> 12:41.291
You want to weigh in on this?

12:43.416 --> 12:44.041
Zuhair?

12:44.791 --> 12:47.208
I'm not supposed to
speak from behind the camera.

12:47.208 --> 12:48.208
Fuck it. You know, Dorian?

12:48.625 --> 12:49.500
You want to know something?

12:49.541 --> 12:51.916
You can take the baguette we gave you
to make your banh mi sandwich

12:51.916 --> 12:52.875
and you can shove it up your ass.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.750
And you, Zuhair?
If you want to gang up with him,

12:54.750 --> 12:57.375
Guess what?
Fuck you and your constitutional democracy

12:57.375 --> 12:58.375
and impeccable English.

12:58.375 --> 13:00.458
It's not fair!
I didn't even say anything, Vic.

13:02.416 --> 13:03.708
Why do you have to do that, Dorian?

13:06.500 --> 13:07.500
You know what?

13:07.500 --> 13:09.500
I'm trying to figure out
if there is a film here.

13:10.125 --> 13:10.625
All right?

13:11.541 --> 13:13.958
You think anybody wants to watch a movie

13:13.958 --> 13:16.166
about some kind of rich one percenter?

13:16.458 --> 13:18.500
Oh, oh, my family is so cool.

13:18.500 --> 13:20.208
They're so rich,

13:20.208 --> 13:21.291
and he's a war hero.

13:21.291 --> 13:22.291
Come on. Get out of here.

13:22.291 --> 13:24.833
Take this big load of ego in your mouth.

13:24.833 --> 13:26.458
Get the fuck out of here, man.

13:27.125 --> 13:29.875
You know, I'm really surprised

13:29.875 --> 13:31.666
that you're aligning yourself
with this narrative.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.083
Being that you're from India, and all.

13:34.416 --> 13:35.583
You're oversimplifying things.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.458
I'm oversimplifying things?

13:37.666 --> 13:38.125
Wow.

13:38.458 --> 13:39.458
I'm oversimplifying things.

13:39.458 --> 13:41.666
You know what?
You can be a house nigger all you want.

13:41.666 --> 13:43.208
Just leave me out of that shit.

13:43.375 --> 13:44.375
What's a 'house nigger'?

13:45.000 --> 13:46.583
A house nigger, Zuhair.

13:47.375 --> 13:48.708
In lieu of a field nigger.

13:48.708 --> 13:51.833
A house nigger lives in the house
next to the slave master.

13:51.833 --> 13:52.833
Gets the education.

13:52.833 --> 13:54.750
The field nigger...
I don't have time to explain.

13:54.750 --> 13:55.875
That's your problem.

13:55.875 --> 13:57.583
You see everything
through an American lens.

13:57.583 --> 13:59.250
I'm not a Slumdog Millionaire.

14:00.125 --> 14:01.708
I come from a family of business owners.

14:01.708 --> 14:03.708
We paid our servants to go to Hajj.

14:04.500 --> 14:07.125
I don't even know how to use a dishwasher.
Or iron a shirt.

14:10.791 --> 14:12.458
You sound very proud to say that.

14:12.458 --> 14:14.375
It's not that I'm proud of it.

14:14.791 --> 14:17.833
It's just that it's not fair
that you expect blind loyalty from me

14:17.833 --> 14:18.833
just because I'm brown.

14:19.125 --> 14:21.125
My reality is not your reality.

14:21.125 --> 14:22.875
And Vic has his own reality.

14:24.208 --> 14:25.333
Reality.

14:26.541 --> 14:28.083
You know...

14:28.458 --> 14:29.583
Reality?

14:30.708 --> 14:31.708
Really? Reality?

14:31.708 --> 14:33.333
There's only one reality, Zuhair.

14:33.791 --> 14:35.083
Truth is the truth.

14:35.500 --> 14:38.416
- What you're talking about is perception.
- Semantics!

14:39.750 --> 14:41.041
You know how I see it?

14:43.041 --> 14:45.208
I see an entire country

14:45.208 --> 14:48.291
built off the backs of poor people
in far away lands.

14:50.208 --> 14:52.500
I see a fortune—his fortune—

14:54.291 --> 14:57.250
dug up from the grounds of black people,

14:57.250 --> 14:58.791
by black hands,

14:59.333 --> 15:00.916
and passed down to him!

15:01.708 --> 15:02.791
That's the reality.

15:03.416 --> 15:04.500
Fair enough, Dorian.

15:04.500 --> 15:06.625
I just don't understand
how this will help the documentary.

15:06.625 --> 15:09.041
It helps to document because
it's fact and we're telling it!

15:10.041 --> 15:11.041
That's how it helps.

15:11.666 --> 15:14.250
I'm not the kind of dude
that's going to walk the line

15:14.250 --> 15:15.541
to appease his ego.

15:15.541 --> 15:17.833
If he wants to make this film

15:17.833 --> 15:19.666
rewriting history

15:19.666 --> 15:22.916
and his family's involvement
in rewriting history,

15:22.916 --> 15:24.791
he's going to have to do that
on his own time.

15:24.791 --> 15:26.625
- That's not what I do.
- It's his film, Dorian!

15:26.625 --> 15:28.083
It's not his film!

15:28.916 --> 15:30.333
I thought we understood that.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.125
It's not his film.

15:32.125 --> 15:33.125
It's his father,

15:33.500 --> 15:34.625
it's his story,

15:35.250 --> 15:36.916
but it's not his film!

15:36.916 --> 15:38.208
It's mine!

15:43.583 --> 15:45.875
I need this, Dorian. Please.

16:20.583 --> 16:24.750
So, I call out to him,
and he finally busts open the door.

16:24.750 --> 16:26.791
'What the hell is going on down there?!'

16:26.791 --> 16:30.083
And he starts stomping down the stairs
like he's going to kick my ass.

16:30.541 --> 16:32.750
He rounds the bend into the kitchen

16:32.750 --> 16:35.166
and sees this pelican,

16:35.166 --> 16:38.583
and without a moment's hesitation,

16:38.583 --> 16:40.750
he jumps onto the kitchen table,

16:40.750 --> 16:42.875
grabs this pelican around the neck,

16:42.875 --> 16:46.541
and starts swinging it around
like a pillow in a pillow fight.

16:46.541 --> 16:48.958
He slams its body down on the counter,

16:48.958 --> 16:50.750
just snapping its neck in one,

16:50.750 --> 16:53.750
and just grabs this bird, walks out,

16:53.750 --> 16:56.125
like it was just another Wednesday,

16:56.125 --> 16:58.708
opens the trash can,
throws the bird in there,

16:58.708 --> 17:01.791
closes the lid,
and goes back up to his room.

17:05.625 --> 17:07.583
What happened to the pelican?

17:07.583 --> 17:10.125
The pelican? The pelican was dead.

17:10.125 --> 17:13.415
I'm assuming the trash man
had a nice little surprise.

17:16.208 --> 17:20.290
It was weird, because I've never seen
a pelican in the South of France before

17:20.290 --> 17:22.290
and I haven't seen one since.

17:23.540 --> 17:29.041
But I guess,
what I like about that story is that,

17:29.791 --> 17:34.958
My dad was just one of those guys
that when he saw something

17:34.958 --> 17:36.791
he just reacted.

17:36.791 --> 17:39.458
He just seemed to always know what to do.

17:39.458 --> 17:42.458
There was no hesitation.
He just did what had to be done.

17:42.458 --> 17:43.458
No questions asked.

17:43.458 --> 17:45.250
And then just moved on with his life.

17:45.541 --> 17:50.291
I guess I wish I had more of that in me,
you know?

17:53.000 --> 17:55.375
That's your best story of your father?

17:58.041 --> 18:00.750
It's the only one I can think of right now.

18:35.666 --> 18:40.791
My father walked these
exact twenty five kilometers

18:40.791 --> 18:42.583
just over seventy years ago.

18:42.583 --> 18:44.500
I've only ever seen black and white photos

18:44.500 --> 18:46.000
so it's kind of a treat to see it in color.
- Wait, what?

18:46.958 --> 18:49.666
- Did you say twenty five kilometers?
- Yeah

18:49.916 --> 18:51.166
How many miles is that?

18:51.291 --> 18:54.875
It'll take us about six hours
but it took him over a week!

18:56.291 --> 18:58.083
Six fucking hours?!

19:00.958 --> 19:01.958
Vic!

19:07.333 --> 19:08.333
How long is...

19:08.625 --> 19:09.625
How long?

19:10.208 --> 19:12.708
We're not even a quarter of the way,

19:12.833 --> 19:16.500
At the top of this hill there's an outlook.

19:32.875 --> 19:35.916
So, tell us about the mom, Vic.

19:37.375 --> 19:38.791
What's up with her?

19:42.125 --> 19:45.458
The documentary is really
going to stay focused on my dad.

19:48.208 --> 19:52.583
You don't think the wife
factors into the legacy at all?

19:52.791 --> 19:53.791
Hey, Zuhair?

19:54.500 --> 19:55.166
Hm?

19:55.458 --> 19:57.333
What's Gandhi's wife's name?

19:57.625 --> 19:59.125
Gandhi's wife's name...

20:01.125 --> 20:02.125
See?

20:05.041 --> 20:06.583
What's your point?

20:07.208 --> 20:08.958
Okay. What's Malcolm X's wife's name?

20:09.541 --> 20:12.416
Betty Shabazz.
Born Betty Dean Sanders.

20:12.416 --> 20:13.416
Lucky guess.

20:13.708 --> 20:19.583
You're seriously comparing
your father to Malcolm X right now?

20:20.250 --> 20:25.625
What I'm saying is that I'm trying to paint
a picture of the man, not the husband.

20:26.500 --> 20:30.958
Right. But you learn a lot from a man,
from his wife.

20:33.500 --> 20:34.625
Kasturba Gandhi!

20:34.625 --> 20:35.625
Kasturba.

20:37.041 --> 20:38.041
Boom.

21:02.166 --> 21:05.125
They marched this whole gorge by foot.

21:05.125 --> 21:08.875
Unfortunately they couldn't
take any vehicles down here,

21:08.875 --> 21:13.125
but it had the added benefit
of being guarded from air strikes,

21:13.416 --> 21:16.916
and it was also the fastest route
to get through the mountains.

21:17.666 --> 21:20.916
They were worried about ambushes
sitting on top of the hills

21:20.916 --> 21:22.541
so my dad actually
volunteered to be a runner.

21:22.541 --> 21:25.583
He'd run ahead, light and fast
in front of everyone

21:25.583 --> 21:27.791
and scope it out and make sure
there was no one waiting for them.

21:27.791 --> 21:29.375
If he made it back by night fall

21:29.375 --> 21:30.875
they'd all move slowly

21:30.875 --> 21:33.583
and hit that same stretch he ran

21:34.708 --> 21:36.416
under the cover of darkness.

21:37.083 --> 21:39.041
They were worried about bottlenecks

21:39.041 --> 21:40.375
and bad things happening there,

21:40.375 --> 21:41.958
and not being able to retreat fast enough.

21:41.958 --> 21:43.666
So my dad actually had the brilliant idea

21:43.666 --> 21:45.541
of outfitting every sixth man

21:45.541 --> 21:46.708
with a self-inflating raft.

21:47.041 --> 21:48.833
That way, if shit got heavy

21:48.833 --> 21:50.375
they could just drop their gear,

21:50.375 --> 21:52.750
throw the raft in the
water, six men to a raft,

21:52.750 --> 21:54.916
and let the current carry
them back to safety.

21:59.541 --> 22:01.083
I just wish I could have been there, man.

22:19.875 --> 22:21.750
What the hell are you doing?

22:22.125 --> 22:23.291
Good morning, Dorian.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.833
Good morning.
What the hell are you doing?

22:26.125 --> 22:27.958
I'm trying to catch a stoat on camera.

22:29.041 --> 22:30.291
What the hell is a stoat?

22:31.750 --> 22:32.750
You don't know what a st...

22:32.916 --> 22:36.458
A stoat is like a weasel.
Like a little weasel.

22:37.791 --> 22:38.791
The rapper?

22:39.500 --> 22:40.166
What?

22:40.541 --> 22:41.541
Nevermind.

22:41.708 --> 22:42.875
Where are the croissants?

22:43.250 --> 22:45.333
I ate the last one. Sorry.

22:48.583 --> 22:50.166
We can get more!

22:50.666 --> 22:51.958
Do you remember where the bakery is at?

22:52.166 --> 22:52.750
Yeah.

22:54.125 --> 22:56.750
So, tell me, Zuhair,

22:56.750 --> 22:59.666
what made you get into filmmaking?

22:59.666 --> 23:01.083
It's a long story.

23:01.625 --> 23:03.750
Well, we got time, man.

23:05.000 --> 23:08.583
I was working with my family business
for the last few years.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.250
I was a salesman there.
Not very good at it.

23:12.250 --> 23:13.250
What business is this?

23:13.250 --> 23:16.375
Car dealership.
My dad has a car dealership business.

23:17.166 --> 23:20.541
It was kind of decided for me
that this is what I have to do.

23:21.750 --> 23:23.833
But last year, I had a stroke.

23:25.333 --> 23:26.333
A stroke?

23:26.458 --> 23:27.041
Yeah.

23:27.416 --> 23:29.750
- A burst blood vessel, yes.
- Oh, shit!

23:30.541 --> 23:33.208
It took me a long time
before I could walk and talk again.

23:33.625 --> 23:34.625
It was a tough time.

23:34.916 --> 23:36.666
Even more so on my Mahjabeen.

23:36.666 --> 23:39.541
Ali was born and she had to
take care of both of us.

23:40.083 --> 23:41.875
She sounds like a keeper though.

23:41.875 --> 23:45.541
During rehabilitation,
it was the first time ever

23:45.541 --> 23:48.500
that I pondered upon what
I want to do with my life.

23:49.000 --> 23:50.500
- You know?
- Yeah, yeah.

23:50.541 --> 23:52.583
And this is what I want to do, man.

23:52.625 --> 23:54.458
I hear you man, I hear you.

23:54.708 --> 23:56.250
I've got to make it, man.

23:56.250 --> 23:59.000
My dad has given me a year,
so to speak, to make it.

23:59.000 --> 24:01.250
Otherwise he expects me to
come back and work for him again.

24:02.208 --> 24:04.125
Why are these so much better here?

24:04.250 --> 24:05.250
They are good, right?

24:05.250 --> 24:07.958
Yeah, it's just yeast and chocolate

24:08.583 --> 24:10.250
but it's so much better!

24:10.500 --> 24:11.500
You want some of mine?

24:11.666 --> 24:14.041
- Go ahead.
- I wasn't going to give you any, anyway.

24:14.041 --> 24:16.541
Oh, my God, look at these
chocolate specks in it. See that?

24:16.875 --> 24:17.958
Oh, my God!

24:18.208 --> 24:19.750
Bringing the chocolate 'pain'!

24:19.916 --> 24:21.666
Is that your new nickname?

24:22.416 --> 24:24.000
Want to know where I got it from?

24:24.583 --> 24:25.250
Where?

24:25.500 --> 24:26.500
Vic's mom.

24:27.416 --> 24:28.416
Last words.

24:30.041 --> 24:31.041
That's not funny, dude.

24:31.041 --> 24:32.041
What the fuck is wrong with you?

24:32.041 --> 24:33.125
She just died recently.

24:33.708 --> 24:35.166
How are you guys like this, man?

24:35.166 --> 24:36.333
What's with your culture?

24:36.791 --> 24:39.458
You talk about fucking
respecting people in Africa

24:39.458 --> 24:41.583
And here you are fucking
disrespecting a dead mother?

24:42.500 --> 24:43.958
She was in a home for
the last fifteen years.

24:43.958 --> 24:46.708
You don't give a flying fuck.
Her son didn't give a flying fuck.

24:46.708 --> 24:48.416
Okay, okay. I'm sorry.

24:48.416 --> 24:50.166
Shit, Zuhair. Damn!

24:51.916 --> 24:53.208
Wait a minute.

24:54.291 --> 24:55.291
Wait a minute.

24:56.958 --> 24:58.125
What did you just say?

24:59.583 --> 25:02.333
She was in a home for fifteen years?

25:04.208 --> 25:05.625
- Yeah.
- Is that what you said?

25:06.458 --> 25:08.958
Zuhair. She was in a
home for fifteen years?

25:09.208 --> 25:10.333
Yeah, she was in a home.

25:10.333 --> 25:11.333
A convalescent home?

25:11.958 --> 25:13.916
I don't know, I didn't go inside yesterday.

25:17.458 --> 25:20.166
You didn't go inside?
You guys went to the home

25:20.625 --> 25:22.916
of his mother and you didn't go inside?

25:23.166 --> 25:24.250
It's not what you think.

25:24.250 --> 25:27.125
He got a call and
he just dropped in and he...

26:14.250 --> 26:15.333
He looks pissed.

26:16.125 --> 26:17.125
Oh well.

26:19.708 --> 26:22.208
What the hell, guys? We're late!

26:22.375 --> 26:23.375
For what?

26:41.625 --> 26:43.291
It's nice here.

27:04.416 --> 27:06.916
Should I roll here? The camera?

27:06.916 --> 27:08.750
Yeah, why not. She said it's okay.

27:28.375 --> 27:30.708
Okay, do you want me to do this in English?

27:30.916 --> 27:32.541
That's probably a good idea.

27:32.541 --> 27:33.958
Okay, that's not a problem.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.958
So, basically, I have everything
here ready for you to sign,

27:36.958 --> 27:37.500
Okay.

27:37.500 --> 27:39.875
and then you will have your name
under all the properties.

27:41.833 --> 27:44.125
And how much are we talking, here?

27:45.125 --> 27:47.041
I'm not an expert but I'd say

27:47.291 --> 27:50.208
all together with all the properties,
about two million euros.

27:50.708 --> 27:53.125
And what about the liquid assets?

27:53.375 --> 27:55.458
No, there's no liquid assets.

27:55.708 --> 27:56.708
What do you mean?

27:57.541 --> 27:58.541
There's no money.

27:59.166 --> 28:00.166
Whatsoever.

28:00.416 --> 28:01.416
How can there be no money?

28:02.041 --> 28:03.041
Well, uh...

28:03.333 --> 28:06.833
Any money that your father had
when he passed away has been spent.

28:07.583 --> 28:09.958
Spent? By whom? My aunt?

28:10.500 --> 28:12.833
Under the conservatorship
of the last years, probably, yes.

28:12.833 --> 28:15.458
But you know your mother
spent it when she was a in home.

28:15.458 --> 28:17.166
It was quite expensive for fifteen years.

28:17.291 --> 28:20.333
But I thought the state
was covering the home.

28:20.541 --> 28:25.083
No. The state took the last tab,
because the estate dried up.

28:25.666 --> 28:26.666
But that's it.

28:26.666 --> 28:30.083
Right now there's
no money whatsoever, for sure,

28:30.083 --> 28:31.708
but you're actually owing money.

28:31.916 --> 28:33.250
I'm owing money?

28:33.250 --> 28:33.916
Yeah.

28:33.916 --> 28:35.500
Back taxes debts.

28:37.000 --> 28:38.291
Property taxes.

28:39.500 --> 28:41.541
ISF. 'Impots sur la fortune'.

28:41.666 --> 28:42.666
Wait, what's that?

28:42.750 --> 28:45.291
The fortune tax. This is a French tax.

28:45.583 --> 28:47.958
As soon as you exceed more than

28:47.958 --> 28:51.291
a million and three hundred thousand
euros in assets,

28:51.291 --> 28:53.000
you need to pay this every year.

28:53.000 --> 28:54.500
But, that's ridiculous!

28:54.916 --> 28:56.750
Well, I'm not making the rules.

28:57.875 --> 29:00.958
Right now, you're actually owing
quite a lot of money.

29:01.250 --> 29:02.250
So, how much?

29:02.750 --> 29:05.416
The total—and I was calculating this—

29:05.416 --> 29:07.791
is about three hundred and
sixty seven thousand euros.

29:07.791 --> 29:08.958
Oh, my God.

29:11.208 --> 29:13.500
Hey, it's not a tragedy.

29:17.541 --> 29:19.375
It's the definition of a tragedy.

29:19.375 --> 29:21.375
You're telling me that
I've been given a gift,

29:21.791 --> 29:25.791
but to redeem the gift I have to
come up with four hundred thousand euros?

29:25.791 --> 29:28.125
Three hundred sixty seven thousand euros.

29:28.583 --> 29:29.583
You're in France.

29:29.583 --> 29:31.416
You need to pay taxes when you
get money; your 'inheritage'

29:31.833 --> 29:32.958
- Okay.
- That's how it works.

29:33.625 --> 29:35.666
- But you live in Germany, right?
- Yes.

29:36.541 --> 29:38.791
And you're not planning on
getting back to France?

29:39.333 --> 29:40.500
I was considering it.

29:40.958 --> 29:42.916
Well, you might not consider it.

29:42.916 --> 29:46.500
If you stay in Germany
you won't have to pay the fortune tax.

29:46.500 --> 29:48.333
You will have to pay it for this
time, of course,

29:48.333 --> 29:49.750
because it's back taxes

29:49.750 --> 29:52.791
but then you won't be responsible
for the years to come.

29:53.208 --> 29:55.250
Okay, but I still don't understand

29:55.250 --> 29:57.708
how I'm supposed to come up with
four hundred thousand euros.

29:57.708 --> 29:59.000
I don't have that kind of cash.

29:59.000 --> 30:00.541
No, I imagined you wouldn't.

30:00.541 --> 30:02.083
There's actually two options.

30:02.083 --> 30:05.333
The first one is probably
something you will not consider,

30:05.333 --> 30:07.708
but maybe selling everything?

30:09.166 --> 30:10.541
Well, I might have to, right?

30:10.625 --> 30:12.750
No, because there is a second option.

30:12.750 --> 30:14.791
If you sell the farmhouse

30:14.791 --> 30:16.875
you could go over all the debts.

30:17.583 --> 30:21.458
That's the one house I'm actually
really attached to.

30:21.458 --> 30:22.458
Really?

30:22.750 --> 30:25.250
You might consider it, though.
It's really in bad condition.

30:25.250 --> 30:27.208
You wouldn't be able to rent it to anyone,

30:27.208 --> 30:28.375
it would be a dead charge,

30:28.916 --> 30:32.458
There is about a hundred 'mille'...
a hundred thousand euros

30:32.458 --> 30:33.583
just to renovate it.

30:33.833 --> 30:35.541
It's not that bad.

30:35.541 --> 30:37.958
Nobody lived there for forty years!

30:38.750 --> 30:40.916
Everything needs to be redone,

30:40.916 --> 30:43.125
and Béville-le-Comte? Really?

30:43.125 --> 30:45.125
This is a village no one wants to live in.

30:45.125 --> 30:47.541
Okay, I think there is a
confusion or something.

30:47.541 --> 30:51.291
The farmhouse is in Saint-Raphaël,
so I don't know what papers you have...

30:51.666 --> 30:53.041
I wasn't precise enough.

30:53.041 --> 30:54.041
There's two farmhouses!

30:54.041 --> 30:55.875
There's one in Saint-Raphaël, right here.

30:55.875 --> 30:57.250
The second one is in Béville.

30:57.541 --> 30:58.750
Next to Paris.

30:59.875 --> 31:01.333
You didn't know about it.

31:01.333 --> 31:02.500
Let me look at it.

31:06.916 --> 31:07.916
Here.

31:10.208 --> 31:11.208
That's it.

31:12.416 --> 31:15.791
This is an inheritance from your cousins,

31:16.000 --> 31:19.000
your father got a few years ago.

31:19.000 --> 31:23.333
He was really holding on to it,
and I actually don't know why.

31:26.791 --> 31:29.416
So this... This is mine as well?

31:29.750 --> 31:31.583
Yeah! This is all yours.

31:31.583 --> 31:33.791
You might want to go there.
The minute you see it,

31:33.791 --> 31:35.750
you'll probably want to get rid of it.

32:37.750 --> 32:39.500
That was a long drive.

32:42.625 --> 32:43.625
Well!

32:44.000 --> 32:46.833
It's not too shabby. Not too shabby, Vic.

32:46.833 --> 32:47.833
I'll give you that.

32:48.250 --> 32:49.250
Thank you.

32:51.791 --> 32:53.625
It needs some redecorating.

32:54.708 --> 32:55.708
Yup.

32:55.958 --> 33:02.375
I don't know about all this
Pyrex and Seventies shit.

33:02.958 --> 33:05.375
That clown painting can stay, though.

33:26.583 --> 33:29.000
It must have been a million lights!

33:36.458 --> 33:37.625
Oh, he's here!

33:40.958 --> 33:42.291
Ali, say hi!

34:00.416 --> 34:01.833
Hey, Mahjabeen!

34:02.208 --> 34:03.666
Hey, hi, Victor!

34:03.666 --> 34:04.666
How are you?

34:04.666 --> 34:06.291
Good! Long time no see.

34:06.291 --> 34:07.833
I'm sorry I have to cut it short.

34:07.875 --> 34:09.833
I have to send drawings to my work tonight

34:09.833 --> 34:10.833
and I need the laptop.

34:11.333 --> 34:13.125
Aw, all right. No problem.

34:13.125 --> 34:14.125
Let me say bye!

34:14.125 --> 34:15.250
- You tell Zuhair...
- Of course.

34:15.958 --> 34:18.166
I hope you didn't log into your account

34:18.166 --> 34:20.625
because I don't want NSA
flagging my computer.

34:31.625 --> 34:32.583
Chartres.

34:32.791 --> 34:33.791
Chartres.

34:35.000 --> 34:37.250
Down here. Feel it here.

34:39.375 --> 34:41.000
Please don't touch my neck.

34:44.875 --> 34:45.875
Look at it!

34:48.875 --> 34:52.416
So, when I was twelve
my mom got in a bad car accident.

34:53.625 --> 34:56.041
It was bad brain damage.

34:56.041 --> 34:58.166
She was in and out of consciousness,

34:58.166 --> 34:59.916
sort of like a semi-vegetative state.

35:00.416 --> 35:04.250
Even on her best days
she could barely communicate

35:04.250 --> 35:06.791
beyond basic facial expressions.

35:07.750 --> 35:10.583
I guess he had done it,
because she had been wandering,

35:11.041 --> 35:13.041
and gotten lost and stuff.

35:13.041 --> 35:16.750
He felt is was the best way
to keep her safe, I guess.

35:17.416 --> 35:20.958
Anyway, the cops blew it
way out of proportion.

35:20.958 --> 35:22.791
They got social services involved,

35:22.791 --> 35:25.125
and my aunt just wouldn't drop it.

35:25.125 --> 35:27.166
She just would not drop it.

35:27.166 --> 35:28.833
It was like a witch-hunt.

35:29.208 --> 35:32.708
So she ended up getting some quack doctor

35:32.708 --> 35:35.958
to make up some shit about my dad.

35:36.791 --> 35:41.375
The doctor claimed that my dad
had been forcing himself on my mom.

35:42.083 --> 35:44.375
The companies got wind of it,

35:45.083 --> 35:47.833
and the board members forced him out.

35:47.833 --> 35:48.833
It was just...

35:50.000 --> 35:52.041
It just broke him, you know?

35:53.041 --> 35:54.916
And he just never recovered

35:54.916 --> 35:57.916
because six months later
he just went and dropped dead.

35:58.541 --> 36:02.458
They said it was a question of consent
but they had been married for years!

36:02.666 --> 36:08.416
And if they can't tell
whether my mom could consent to it,

36:08.416 --> 36:10.625
they can't tell whether
she didn't consent to it.

36:10.625 --> 36:14.125
But to lock her in a room!
That's kind of harsh.

36:14.916 --> 36:16.916
Yeah, that's the position they took.

36:19.750 --> 36:23.333
I guess you can understand why, like,

36:23.333 --> 36:29.291
I don't want to talk about
my mom and my dad in the movie

36:29.291 --> 36:34.500
because I don't know how to talk about
the man that I knew,

36:34.500 --> 36:36.291
and then bring something like that up.

36:36.291 --> 36:37.708
Do you know what I mean?

36:38.916 --> 36:39.916
Yeah.

36:41.416 --> 36:43.791
I get it, I guess.

36:46.000 --> 36:47.583
It's clearing up.

36:52.666 --> 36:54.125
It's clearing up!

36:59.500 --> 37:03.416
Keep your eyes out for
signs that read Béville-le-Comte.

37:05.250 --> 37:06.250
In English?

37:33.250 --> 37:39.041
Oh, yes! This is where dreams come to die.

38:07.583 --> 38:08.583
Locked.

38:09.000 --> 38:09.750
It's locked?

38:09.750 --> 38:10.750
Obviously.

38:10.750 --> 38:12.125
You don't have the keys?

38:12.125 --> 38:13.458
No, she didn't give me the keys.

38:13.458 --> 38:14.666
She doesn't have keys!

38:28.833 --> 38:31.916
'Cimetière'!
There's a cemetery this way.

38:50.708 --> 38:52.208
Check that out.

38:52.458 --> 38:55.000
Look, it says 'peace' on the bottom,

38:55.458 --> 38:58.000
and then it's got a
grenade right over that.

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
That's kind of contradictory.

39:05.708 --> 39:06.583
Yo!

39:19.875 --> 39:20.875
Cintract...

39:22.458 --> 39:23.958
Arthur Cintract?

39:25.958 --> 39:26.958
That's your last name, non?

39:27.208 --> 39:28.958
Yeah, that's my last name.

39:33.666 --> 39:34.958
That's weird.

39:37.875 --> 39:40.916
It's not exactly a common last name.

39:43.208 --> 39:45.583
And it is a small town.

39:56.250 --> 39:58.958
I don't understand what's going on.

40:02.166 --> 40:03.166
I don't get it.

40:41.291 --> 40:49.708
Ram Nam Satya Hai.

40:56.250 --> 40:58.541
Final touch...

41:01.916 --> 41:03.791
What the fuck, man?

41:07.041 --> 41:08.041
Jesus!

41:08.041 --> 41:09.708
This is kind of creepy.

41:10.041 --> 41:13.708
Speaking of creepy, that stupid ass
clown painting was staring at me all night.

41:14.041 --> 41:16.875
Yeah, he's got a tendency to do that.

41:16.875 --> 41:18.375
I like this painting, though.

41:19.875 --> 41:22.291
That shit is ugly.
Why would anyone buy that?

41:22.291 --> 41:27.291
The artist actually killed himself a few
years ago, so I'm sure someone would...

41:51.416 --> 41:52.416
Vic!

41:52.416 --> 41:53.416
Yeah?

41:59.583 --> 42:01.000
Did you know about this?

43:42.125 --> 43:44.625
These are all five hundreds!

43:45.291 --> 43:46.583
One, two,

43:47.125 --> 43:48.125
three,

43:48.583 --> 43:49.583
four, five,

43:50.375 --> 43:51.375
seven,

43:51.625 --> 43:52.625
nine, ten!

43:52.625 --> 43:55.000
There's two point five million francs, man!

43:55.000 --> 43:56.000
It's worthless.

43:56.750 --> 43:57.750
How much is a franc?

43:58.083 --> 43:59.958
Used to be about seventeen cents.

44:01.041 --> 44:04.750
That's still, like,
almost half a million dollars?

44:04.958 --> 44:07.333
No, it used to be half a million dollars

44:07.333 --> 44:10.333
but the cut-off date to turn your
francs into euros was in 2012,

44:10.333 --> 44:12.416
so no. It's fucking wallpaper.

44:13.791 --> 44:15.750
Ooh, that's got to sting.

44:15.958 --> 44:18.166
I'm so fucking mad at him.

44:18.166 --> 44:23.416
I'm so fucking mad.
Why couldn't he just delegate?

44:23.416 --> 44:25.666
Why did he have to be so guarded?

44:26.833 --> 44:30.708
My God. I don't know how
I'm going to get out of this one.

44:31.208 --> 44:34.083
Dude, you've got to look at the
bright side, man. It could be worse.

44:36.875 --> 44:40.000
Explain to me how it could be worse.

44:40.000 --> 44:43.583
I have three houses,
I have half a million euros in debt,

44:43.583 --> 44:46.750
and I've got no fucking
blueprint on how to fix this.

44:46.750 --> 44:50.375
So please tell me how the fuck it
could be worse, Dorian.

44:50.375 --> 44:52.958
You could have no houses, instead of three.

44:53.708 --> 44:56.916
Yeah, and there are starving
kids in Africa with AIDS.

44:56.916 --> 44:59.708
Give me a break, Dorian.
I'm not in the mood.

45:00.833 --> 45:01.833
Look.

45:04.083 --> 45:05.083
Keys.

45:05.708 --> 45:07.875
It looks like, to the house.

45:07.875 --> 45:09.125
At least you've got that.

45:11.666 --> 45:12.958
What's this?

45:16.750 --> 45:18.041
Check that out.

45:21.791 --> 45:23.208
Who is this, Vic?

45:29.000 --> 45:30.125
What the fuck?

45:40.750 --> 45:41.750
Who is that?

45:44.833 --> 45:46.458
Do you know who that is?

45:47.791 --> 45:49.583
Victor, do you know who that is?

46:06.958 --> 46:08.333
Is that a phone number?

46:08.333 --> 46:09.916
Looks like it.

46:12.291 --> 46:14.166
This is getting weird, man.

46:15.708 --> 46:18.041
Victor! Who is that!?

47:29.041 --> 47:32.416
There's no sense in us standing here
like a bunch of idiots.

48:00.208 --> 48:01.333
You coming?

48:30.875 --> 48:33.291
Looks like somebody fired the gardener.

48:56.208 --> 48:57.458
Yo, Zu!

48:59.000 --> 49:00.291
Come get this shot.

49:24.375 --> 49:26.041
This is field work Zuhair.

49:27.541 --> 49:29.958
This is what we're here to do.

49:31.125 --> 49:32.625
So exciting!

50:27.291 --> 50:29.000
Lights work.

50:29.250 --> 50:32.083
No gardener. Lights work.

50:45.958 --> 50:46.958
Creepy.

51:15.708 --> 51:17.833
What the hell is all this?
What happened here?

51:18.916 --> 51:21.250
I don't know. Maybe an owl or something,

51:21.250 --> 51:23.166
tearing up the carpeting to make a nest.

52:08.791 --> 52:10.375
Maid's fired.

52:24.000 --> 52:26.333
Dorian! Check this out.

52:29.208 --> 52:30.666
Oh, shit.

52:39.708 --> 52:41.666
Canned in 2002.

52:42.958 --> 52:45.000
Expired in 2005.

52:47.875 --> 52:50.625
Hey, Victor!
When did you say your dad died again?

52:54.083 --> 52:55.083
Vic!

53:11.041 --> 53:12.208
Oh, shit!

53:12.583 --> 53:13.583
What?

53:16.250 --> 53:17.708
It's your mom!

53:29.250 --> 53:30.250
Dorian?

53:33.416 --> 53:34.416
Dorian!

53:39.291 --> 53:40.708
Do you still have the photographs?

53:40.833 --> 53:41.833
Yeah.

53:51.416 --> 53:52.708
You want to see that one?

53:52.708 --> 53:53.708
No, the other one.

53:54.500 --> 53:55.500
That one?

54:00.458 --> 54:01.458
Oh, man.

54:02.750 --> 54:04.291
That's the bed.

54:14.375 --> 54:15.791
And that's the dress.

54:24.708 --> 54:26.541
I'm getting the chills, man.

54:42.750 --> 54:44.125
This is creepy.

54:46.333 --> 54:47.833
This is good creepy.

54:49.250 --> 54:50.375
We've got something.

54:50.791 --> 54:52.208
Let's get out of here, man.

54:52.208 --> 54:55.208
Not yet. Not yet.

55:18.333 --> 55:20.125
Attics.

55:20.666 --> 55:22.208
Never liked them.

55:22.375 --> 55:25.000
Yeah, not my favorite, either.

55:25.833 --> 55:27.291
After you, Dorian.

55:27.916 --> 55:30.708
Fuck that noise! Youth before beauty.

55:30.833 --> 55:32.791
I think you may have that idiom backwards.

55:33.791 --> 55:35.625
Is it beauty before youth?

55:36.958 --> 55:39.666
You're the investigative journalist!
Please lead the way.

55:40.500 --> 55:43.083
Investigative journalist.
Not ghost buster.

55:43.916 --> 55:45.208
After you, sir.

55:45.666 --> 55:47.041
Come on, man.

56:20.250 --> 56:21.541
Hey, Dorian!

56:22.625 --> 56:23.458
Yo?

56:24.416 --> 56:25.416
How's it looking?

56:25.625 --> 56:27.250
Would you like to meet Casper?

56:27.458 --> 56:29.083
Oh, fuck you, man.

56:39.083 --> 56:40.833
All right. Well...

56:48.458 --> 56:51.083
Let's lay it out, man. Let's lay it out.

56:51.083 --> 56:52.583
What do we got?

56:57.125 --> 56:58.375
What do we know?

57:00.833 --> 57:02.125
She looks young.

57:02.833 --> 57:04.000
That she does.

57:04.958 --> 57:06.375
She was here.

57:06.833 --> 57:08.333
That she was.

57:10.416 --> 57:11.916
I don't know...

57:11.916 --> 57:13.416
Do you think it's possible?

57:15.708 --> 57:16.708
Say it, man.

57:17.708 --> 57:18.708
I don't know.

57:18.708 --> 57:21.625
Why would Vic not know anything about it?

57:22.333 --> 57:24.541
Why were the photographs in the safe?

57:25.750 --> 57:27.000
And the money.

57:28.666 --> 57:32.291
Do you think his dad had another family?

57:32.291 --> 57:34.333
That was my first thought.

57:35.708 --> 57:38.375
But if so, when he died,

57:38.375 --> 57:39.791
why didn't they come forward?

57:40.500 --> 57:42.708
Maybe they don't know that he's dead.

57:44.625 --> 57:46.333
It's been fifteen years, man.

57:49.541 --> 57:50.833
Then where are they now?

57:56.791 --> 57:58.041
Let's go find Vic.

58:12.000 --> 58:13.000
Yo, Vic!

58:14.875 --> 58:15.875
Vic!

58:16.916 --> 58:17.916
Victor?

58:41.833 --> 58:43.333
Did you find him?

58:43.333 --> 58:45.166
No, man. Car is here though.

58:48.083 --> 58:49.375
Yo, Victor!

58:49.833 --> 58:51.541
Don't fuck around, man! Where you at?

58:57.041 --> 58:58.250
Victor.

59:00.000 --> 59:01.208
Victoria!

59:02.791 --> 59:04.250
Vicki!

59:05.208 --> 59:07.000
You little bitch, where you at?

59:13.541 --> 59:14.541
Vic!

59:22.291 --> 59:23.291
Got it?

59:26.625 --> 59:30.125
Oh, yeah! It's the
Secret fucking Garden back here, ain't it?

59:34.041 --> 59:35.041
Vic!

59:47.375 --> 59:48.375
Yo, Vic!

01:00:09.083 --> 01:00:10.083
Fuck.

01:00:12.750 --> 01:00:14.000
You all right?

01:00:16.583 --> 01:00:18.458
- Dorian?
- Zu! Yo.

01:00:20.041 --> 01:00:21.375
You okay?

01:00:25.708 --> 01:00:26.708
What's up?

01:00:28.875 --> 01:00:30.583
- What the fuck is this?
- Oh, shit.

01:00:36.875 --> 01:00:39.208
Is it just me,
or does that look like a grave?

01:00:39.958 --> 01:00:41.583
Maybe it's Asterix.

01:00:43.041 --> 01:00:44.250
What's Asterix?

01:00:44.708 --> 01:00:46.125
Their family dog!

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:48.791
I don't know what you're talking about,

01:00:48.791 --> 01:00:50.583
but that doesn't look
like a dog grave, really.

01:01:13.208 --> 01:01:14.208
Vic!

01:01:18.250 --> 01:01:19.791
Where did you find that?

01:01:22.333 --> 01:01:23.541
Let's go, guys.

01:01:23.541 --> 01:01:24.916
There's a grave here, Vic.

01:01:24.916 --> 01:01:26.500
There's a fucking grave back here.

01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:28.875
Yeah come check this out, man.

01:01:31.208 --> 01:01:32.791
That's the documentary.

01:01:33.333 --> 01:01:36.375
That's the story that needs to be told.

01:01:38.250 --> 01:01:40.458
I want you guys to leave my family alone.

01:01:41.416 --> 01:01:43.125
I can't do that, man.

01:01:43.125 --> 01:01:44.375
I can't make that happen.

01:01:45.083 --> 01:01:47.291
It's too late! It's out of our hands.

01:01:47.708 --> 01:01:48.708
Dorian,

01:01:49.083 --> 01:01:52.041
you understand that this is
my father's legacy, right?

01:01:52.458 --> 01:01:54.666
Your father's legacy is a lie.

01:01:55.333 --> 01:01:56.333
Yeah?

01:01:56.333 --> 01:01:58.625
What about our friendship?
Is that a lie?

01:02:02.041 --> 01:02:03.750
Zuhair, how much are you getting paid?

01:02:03.750 --> 01:02:04.750
Jesus Christ.

01:02:05.458 --> 01:02:06.916
I'm getting paid twelve grand.

01:02:07.208 --> 01:02:08.458
Twelve grand?

01:02:08.458 --> 01:02:10.833
I'm not talking about me and Zuhair,

01:02:10.833 --> 01:02:13.000
I'm talking about you and me right now.

01:02:13.291 --> 01:02:16.375
I couldn't even pronounce your name
up until a couple of days ago.

01:02:16.791 --> 01:02:19.708
So don't try to blackmail
my silence with friendship.

01:02:20.708 --> 01:02:21.708
Sad.

01:02:21.708 --> 01:02:23.208
Pitiful, really.

01:02:24.750 --> 01:02:27.666
If you were really my friend,

01:02:29.333 --> 01:02:30.875
you would have contributed
to my Kickstarter.

01:02:30.875 --> 01:02:32.416
Oh, my God, I fucking knew it.

01:02:32.416 --> 01:02:34.791
Yeah, I know you knew it.

01:02:35.125 --> 01:02:36.125
But you didn't.

01:02:37.166 --> 01:02:38.708
You watched it fail.

01:02:39.458 --> 01:02:40.458
Why?

01:02:43.166 --> 01:02:45.750
So you could capitalize on the failure,

01:02:46.666 --> 01:02:48.416
and get me to shoot your film.

01:02:49.458 --> 01:02:51.208
That's your version of friendship.

01:02:51.208 --> 01:02:52.208
Are you fucking serious?

01:02:52.208 --> 01:02:54.791
Dorian, what world do you live in
where you get shit for free?

01:02:54.791 --> 01:02:56.208
Who wants something for free, man?

01:02:56.208 --> 01:02:59.833
Did I ask for anything for free?
Did you hear me ask for anything free?

01:03:01.375 --> 01:03:02.375
You know?

01:03:02.750 --> 01:03:05.333
I just don't want to sit
here and be disrespected

01:03:05.333 --> 01:03:08.833
with this term 'friendship'
that you throw around so loosely,

01:03:08.833 --> 01:03:13.000
while you're pretending like this
wasn't a business transaction.

01:03:13.208 --> 01:03:16.250
Okay, so if this is a business transaction

01:03:16.250 --> 01:03:19.541
let me explain the new terms to you
super fucking clearly so you get it.

01:03:19.541 --> 01:03:21.875
You make my movie, you get paid.

01:03:21.875 --> 01:03:24.541
You continue doing
whatever the fuck this is,

01:03:24.541 --> 01:03:25.541
you don't.

01:03:30.708 --> 01:03:32.708
We're past that point, man.

01:03:34.416 --> 01:03:36.291
It's bigger than twelve grand.

01:03:36.666 --> 01:03:37.875
Don't you get it?

01:03:39.083 --> 01:03:40.416
It's bigger than you or me!

01:03:40.416 --> 01:03:41.916
It's bigger than Zuhair,

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:44.541
and his car dealership.

01:03:48.083 --> 01:03:49.416
Don't you get it?

01:03:49.791 --> 01:03:51.916
This story is going to be told!

01:03:52.166 --> 01:03:53.166
Fuck.

01:03:53.791 --> 01:03:55.416
With you or without you!

01:03:56.500 --> 01:03:58.375
Approval or no approval.

01:04:00.375 --> 01:04:01.625
Point blank.

01:04:02.833 --> 01:04:05.875
Vic, why is Dorian getting paid
twelve thousand, man?

01:04:07.166 --> 01:04:08.708
This was a good talk. Thanks.

01:04:08.708 --> 01:04:09.708
Vic!

01:04:13.583 --> 01:04:16.166
Dorian, will you please explain to me
what the fuck is going on here?

01:04:16.166 --> 01:04:18.500
You're getting screwed, Zuhair.
That's what's going on here, man.

01:04:18.958 --> 01:04:20.916
Why the fuck are you telling me now?

01:04:22.333 --> 01:04:23.333
Just...

01:04:25.083 --> 01:04:26.750
hang in there, man.

01:04:27.333 --> 01:04:28.500
Hang in there, dude.

01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:29.916
I'm going to get us both paid.

01:04:29.916 --> 01:04:32.208
We don't need his fucking money.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.958
Where do you keep your SD cards?

01:04:48.791 --> 01:04:49.791
Why?

01:04:51.458 --> 01:04:53.833
Because I want to make sure they're safe.

01:04:54.333 --> 01:04:56.750
They're safe with me, man.
I'll hang on to them.

01:04:58.625 --> 01:04:59.750
You do that.

01:05:04.458 --> 01:05:07.000
Dorian, do we have to stay here tonight?

01:05:24.416 --> 01:05:25.875
Victor?

01:05:28.083 --> 01:05:31.125
I think I always knew you
paying Dorian something,

01:05:31.625 --> 01:05:34.083
but you said there was no
money for pre-production.

01:05:35.041 --> 01:05:37.250
Even a thousand dollars
would have been nice.

01:05:38.666 --> 01:05:40.083
This hurts, man.

01:05:56.791 --> 01:05:58.291
Can I sleep in here?

01:05:59.458 --> 01:06:00.458
Why?

01:06:01.458 --> 01:06:03.625
I don't want to sleep
on the matrimonial bed.

01:06:04.333 --> 01:06:05.750
You think I do?

01:06:06.333 --> 01:06:08.833
No, I mean can I sleep in here with you?

01:06:11.208 --> 01:06:12.708
That's kind of gay, oui?

01:12:30.333 --> 01:12:31.625
You found her.

01:12:31.833 --> 01:12:33.000
I think I did.

01:12:33.375 --> 01:12:34.541
Where's Dorian?

01:12:34.541 --> 01:12:36.666
- He's sleeping. I'm going to get him.
- No, no.

01:12:36.666 --> 01:12:38.000
Please just...

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:39.416
Wait a second.

01:12:39.708 --> 01:12:43.625
I'd like to talk to you about how
we are going to proceed from here.

01:12:45.416 --> 01:12:47.041
Isn't it too late for that?

01:12:47.375 --> 01:12:49.583
Maybe, but you owe it to me
to hear me out.

01:12:50.166 --> 01:12:51.333
If you insist.

01:12:52.416 --> 01:12:54.875
Let's just tackle the elephant
in the room, okay?

01:12:54.875 --> 01:12:58.666
I need you to understand why I'm paying
Dorian for his time, and not you.

01:12:59.541 --> 01:13:02.083
You think that's the elephant in the room?

01:13:02.083 --> 01:13:03.708
Yes, I do, actually, because

01:13:03.708 --> 01:13:07.250
Dorian has somehow convinced you
that I'm taking advantage of you,

01:13:07.250 --> 01:13:10.375
but I'm not the one taking
advantage of you, Zuhair. Dorian is.

01:13:11.333 --> 01:13:13.791
Victor, nobody is taking advantage
of anybody here!

01:13:13.791 --> 01:13:18.291
How are you so naive? Don't you see
you're holding all the cards here!

01:13:18.875 --> 01:13:19.875
What do you mean by that?

01:13:19.875 --> 01:13:21.166
Like, Literally!

01:13:21.208 --> 01:13:23.875
The SD cards are yours!
That camera is yours!

01:13:23.875 --> 01:13:26.458
The footage is yours!
The entire story is yours!

01:13:26.458 --> 01:13:27.958
And Dorian knows that.

01:13:28.666 --> 01:13:31.708
If you think he's going to
cut you in for a fair deal

01:13:31.708 --> 01:13:34.541
at the end of all of this,
you're fucking wrong man.

01:13:36.208 --> 01:13:37.208
Look.

01:13:39.541 --> 01:13:42.291
First night he got here, first night,

01:13:42.291 --> 01:13:44.083
he tried to have me fire you

01:13:44.083 --> 01:13:46.750
and bring on his cinematographer.

01:13:47.333 --> 01:13:48.708
You're telling me now.

01:13:48.708 --> 01:13:50.750
What's the fucking point of it, now?

01:13:53.416 --> 01:13:55.250
Okay. Fine.

01:13:57.500 --> 01:13:59.000
Let's just...

01:13:59.208 --> 01:14:00.708
Let's leave...

01:14:01.541 --> 01:14:02.875
We'll leave here,

01:14:02.875 --> 01:14:05.708
we'll send Dorian on
the first flight back to Los Angeles,

01:14:05.708 --> 01:14:07.583
I will pay you twenty thousand dollars

01:14:07.583 --> 01:14:09.625
and you will make my movie, my way.

01:14:09.625 --> 01:14:10.625
How does that sound?

01:14:11.458 --> 01:14:12.958
It sounds like a fucking bribe.

01:14:15.291 --> 01:14:17.458
Zuhair, some things are worth fighting for.

01:14:17.916 --> 01:14:21.000
You can't just throw the baby
out with the bath water.

01:14:21.208 --> 01:14:22.750
What is that supposed to mean now?

01:14:23.333 --> 01:14:25.791
Okay, okay. Fine. How do I put this...

01:14:26.208 --> 01:14:28.791
Take the rupee note, right?

01:14:29.041 --> 01:14:30.458
You have Gandhi's face on it.

01:14:30.708 --> 01:14:32.666
Are we supposed to get rid of his face,

01:14:32.666 --> 01:14:35.500
just because he may,
or may not have had mistresses

01:14:35.500 --> 01:14:37.583
and abandoned children, and shit like that?

01:14:37.583 --> 01:14:40.375
Why the fuck do you keep comparing
your father to Gandhi?

01:14:40.375 --> 01:14:44.625
Because just like Gandhi, my father
contributed to the world and to his country,

01:14:44.625 --> 01:14:48.416
and just like Gandhi, people are now
trying to drag his legacy through the mud!

01:14:48.416 --> 01:14:49.416
It's fucking unfair!

01:14:50.041 --> 01:14:53.083
Gandhi did not keep anybody in a basement.

01:14:53.083 --> 01:14:57.125
If he would have done that, his photograph
wouldn't have been on the fucking rupee note!

01:14:57.958 --> 01:14:59.875
But that's my point.

01:14:59.958 --> 01:15:02.791
Isn't the world better,
with fucking Gandhi in it?

01:15:02.958 --> 01:15:05.375
The world is better with
fucking Gandhi in it,

01:15:05.375 --> 01:15:07.416
not someone who keeps a woman
in his basement!

01:15:12.583 --> 01:15:15.458
I can tell, you're not going
to work with me on this, are you?

01:15:15.833 --> 01:15:18.625
You're not giving me
much to work with, man.

01:15:19.750 --> 01:15:22.125
Dude, look. We go a long way back.

01:15:22.333 --> 01:15:23.791
I'm sorry. Listen.

01:15:23.958 --> 01:15:26.041
You've got to come on
this journey with us, man.

01:15:26.541 --> 01:15:29.375
If you come on this journey,
you can position yourself favorably,

01:15:29.375 --> 01:15:31.083
get ahead of the scandal.

01:15:31.541 --> 01:15:34.041
We can really place
this the way we want to.

01:15:34.041 --> 01:15:36.916
You get a say in the
movie, the project, man!

01:15:37.750 --> 01:15:38.750
If not,

01:15:39.875 --> 01:15:43.750
you have no control on
how this story is being told. Zilch.
