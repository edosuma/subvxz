"basic bitch," then?

00:11.279 --> 00:12.346
- That's who you are.

00:12.380 --> 00:14.615

just perfect.

"Hey, it's 3:00 a.m."

00:20.288 --> 00:22.223
Like, "Just checking.
You okay?"

00:22.256 --> 00:24.658
And finally he was like, "Babe,
I'm trying to record,

00:24.692 --> 00:27.261
and you are bothering me
right now."

00:27.295 --> 00:28.396
It scares me.

00:28.429 --> 00:30.531
- The way you've been
behaving lately

00:30.564 --> 00:33.567
has given me great cause
for concern.

00:33.601 --> 00:35.669
- Talk about how your dick
doesn't work either.

00:35.703 --> 00:38.272
- What?
My dick works great.

00:38.306 --> 00:40.641
- I haven't been really
pleasant to be around.

00:40.674 --> 00:42.676
- I know I've done
a lot of f---ed-up things,

00:42.710 --> 00:45.146
but even if I don't always
say it enough,

00:45.179 --> 00:46.414
just know I do love you.

00:48.182 --> 00:50.151
I love you.

You can walk in
to Tom's apartment,

What kind of shake
are you making me?

to his triplet brothers,

to play it off

02:18.339 --> 02:20.774
like it's not a big deal,
I know it really bothers him

02:20.808 --> 02:22.676
that they can't make it
to the wedding.

some red beets.

- Can I put some sugar
in it?

02:32.320 --> 02:33.721

the last minute like this.

I keep thinking about it,

and we're gonna do it;
we're gonna have his brothers.

02:41.295 --> 02:42.263
But if this is gonna cost,
like, $10,000,

02:42.296 --> 02:43.264
I can't afford that.

02:43.297 --> 02:46.267
- 479.
- Round trip, right?

02:46.300 --> 02:48.269
- Yeah, it's $1,500.
- I can do that.

02:48.302 --> 02:49.803
I can throw it

don't tell Tom.

about any of this.

not to say anything either.

Dude, he's gonna be
so excited.

come a day early

04:26.934 --> 04:28.569
just so that they're there
on time.

04:28.602 --> 04:30.471
I know they mean well.
I know they love their brother.

But they're not the most
responsible guys in the world.

Good job.
- Yeah, dude.

04:34.575 --> 04:36.477

these bitches can be,

06:14.041 --> 06:15.776
I definitely like

06:15.809 --> 06:17.511
I don't take this job lightly.

This is, like, the most
creative input I've had

Dude, bang my girlfriend,

06:32.760 --> 06:33.794
but don't eat

candy corn?

Halloween treat.

Now you just get wicked high
on a couch

06:42.069 --> 06:43.804
and eat this sh-- all day long.

- Dude, these are sugar free.

06:44.938 --> 06:46.740
- Who would eat
sugar-free candy?

06:46.774 --> 06:48.442
- They're not going to the gym

06:48.476 --> 06:49.810
and then eating a bunch of candy

06:49.843 --> 06:51.479
and, like, basically
canceling it out.

06:52.946 --> 06:54.915
I lost my candy bag.

06:54.948 --> 06:56.917
- I want a date to the wedding.

06:56.950 --> 06:58.686
- I have two dates this week.
- What?

06:58.719 --> 07:00.588
- I have one tomorrow
and then one Friday,

07:00.621 --> 07:01.722
which I might switch
to Saturday.

You're like, "I don't know.

07:03.724 --> 07:05.058
I might switch my Friday date
to Saturday."

07:07.561 --> 07:08.562
I actually don't want
a date for the wedding,

07:09.930 --> 07:11.431
because I want to be able
to hang out with my friends.

And weddings are a great place
to meet eligible bachelors,

feeling

07:18.972 --> 07:19.006
after Lisa agreed to officiate?

07:20.574 --> 07:22.075
- We're so excited
about our future.

07:22.109 --> 07:23.611
In order to do that,

07:23.644 --> 07:25.679
we have to let go
of, like, the past.

07:25.713 --> 07:28.682
- And now you know how to deal
with the conflict, you know?

07:28.716 --> 07:31.084
Like, I mean, Shay and I went
to therapy once.

07:31.118 --> 07:32.520
Didn't need it again.

07:32.553 --> 07:33.887
We learned how to communicate.

07:33.921 --> 07:35.723
- Yeah,
and it's just the fact

07:35.756 --> 07:37.558
that we're a team;
we're a unit.

07:37.591 --> 07:39.627

on the exciting parts

- You seem really happy.
- Yeah.

07:42.730 --> 07:43.997
- You seem a lot more relaxed.

07:44.031 --> 07:45.633
- Remember that scene
in "Predator"?

07:45.666 --> 07:47.034
He's like, "Hey, you're hit.
You're bleeding."

07:47.067 --> 07:48.936
He's like, "I don't
have time to bleed."

07:48.969 --> 07:50.938
That's me right now, 'cause
I'm in wedding mode, baby.

07:50.971 --> 07:53.841
I'm rock solid.
I'm feeling rock f---ing solid.

07:53.874 --> 07:55.976
You know what?
I fell apart in New Orleans.

07:56.009 --> 07:57.911
Got sloppy.
It was a mess.

07:57.945 --> 07:59.647
- This is not normal.

07:59.680 --> 07:59.713
Tom, what are you doing?
Tom?

08:01.882 --> 08:03.651
- But it had to happen.

08:03.684 --> 08:06.086
Now, moving forward,
I feel like I've exorcised

08:06.119 --> 08:08.856
whatever lingering resentment
was left in me.

08:08.889 --> 08:11.024
It's fully, finally,
all out there,

08:12.560 --> 08:14.027
I gave Tequila Katie
a eulogy today.

08:14.061 --> 08:15.495
[laughter]

08:16.329 --> 08:16.997
Dude, at the cabins,
when we go up to the wedding,

08:17.030 --> 08:18.866
someone has to go in the dark

08:18.899 --> 08:20.634
a say "Tequila Katie"
in the mirror.

08:20.668 --> 08:21.669
- Three times.
- No.

08:22.603 --> 08:23.036
- I'll do it.
Tequila Katie, Tequila Katie--

08:23.704 --> 08:25.639
- Shh.
Don't do it, dude.

- Hi.

08:41.655 --> 08:43.090
- Hey, how was your date night?

08:43.123 --> 08:45.158
- I feel a shift.

08:45.192 --> 08:46.894
When we start a family
one day,

08:46.927 --> 08:48.929
we don't want to be fighting
over, you know,

08:48.962 --> 08:50.964
Tom not having my back
in a bar one night.

08:50.998 --> 08:52.966
- As sh---y as our first year
of marriage was,

08:53.000 --> 08:54.735
I'm like, better now
than, you know,

08:54.768 --> 08:56.904
ten years down the road
and a couple of kids.

08:56.937 --> 08:59.673
Speaking of kids...

08:59.707 --> 09:01.174
No, I'm not pregnant.
- Oh, God.

09:01.208 --> 09:03.844
- We're gonna want kids
sooner rather than later,

09:03.877 --> 09:06.179
and I just want to go
to the fertility doctor.

09:06.213 --> 09:06.980
- Oh, my God.

09:07.014 --> 09:09.049
- Yeah, just to, like,
make sure.

09:09.082 --> 09:10.550
I'm a planner,

09:11.619 --> 09:12.920
and Shay and I have been married
for two years now,

09:12.953 --> 09:14.888
so obviously buying a house
and kids

09:14.922 --> 09:16.990
is the next step
in our relationship.

09:17.024 --> 09:18.992
I'm gonna do anything it takes

09:19.026 --> 09:20.761
so that I can become a mother.

09:20.794 --> 09:22.930
I don't know; next summer,
I might have, like, a--

09:22.963 --> 09:24.932
- What?
- No, that's too soon.

09:24.965 --> 09:25.966
- We'll see.

09:25.999 --> 09:27.701
- I'm pretty sure Shay has to be

09:27.735 --> 09:29.870
in the same room as Scheana
to make a baby.

09:29.903 --> 09:31.905
I can't believe we're having
this talk already.

09:31.939 --> 09:32.973
- You might have kids.

09:33.941 --> 09:34.908
- Listen, they would have
knocked on the door

09:34.942 --> 09:35.909
a long time ago.

09:35.943 --> 09:36.910

09:36.944 --> 09:38.746
Stassi's back in the game too.

09:38.779 --> 09:40.948
- Poor thing. She's always like,
"I don't have a boyfriend."

09:40.981 --> 09:43.116
- I totally have gotten
a sense of how Stassi feels

09:43.150 --> 09:44.685
with the third-
and fifth-wheeling.

09:44.718 --> 09:46.687
The other night, I ended up
at Jax's house

09:46.720 --> 09:47.955
with Kristen, Carter,
Jax, and Brittany.

09:47.988 --> 09:49.189
Shay was still at the studio.

09:49.222 --> 09:50.691
Then we go out to dinner

09:50.724 --> 09:51.959

you, and Schwartz.

I'm like, "Dude, what is it
with this fifth-wheeling sh--?"

09:54.762 --> 09:55.195
- It's not like
Shay's not invited.

09:56.263 --> 09:56.964
- He's been working
on something special for me

09:57.397 --> 09:57.965
in the studio.

09:58.565 --> 09:59.967
- Okay.
- Oh, special.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.034

10:01.068 --> 10:02.836

totally?

10:18.018 --> 10:19.687
I might need to take
my shoes off for my landing.

10:19.720 --> 10:21.188
I was on my way to work,

10:21.221 --> 10:24.725
and I suddenly see,
outside of Sur, two horses.

10:24.758 --> 10:25.759
I mean, WTF?

10:25.793 --> 10:27.728

- You're welcome.

10:27.761 --> 10:29.997
- You need your shoes, Lisa.
- I know. Right?

10:30.030 --> 10:31.999
These two people
basically take their horses

10:32.032 --> 10:33.233
all over the city.

10:33.266 --> 10:35.135
Thank you.
You were such a good boy.

10:35.168 --> 10:37.004
Thank you for the ride.

10:37.037 --> 10:39.039
All right, then.
Off to work.

This is one of the reasons
I love West Hollywood.

of magic and surprise.

Is that going back?

10:55.789 --> 10:58.225
- To a table.
- That's not a big enough pour.

10:58.258 --> 11:00.828
Who poured it?

11:00.861 --> 11:02.996
Mr. Taylor.

11:03.030 --> 11:04.197
What's this?

11:04.231 --> 11:05.766
- Sangria, it looks like.

11:05.799 --> 11:07.234
- Yes.
Did you pour that?

11:07.267 --> 11:08.702
- I may have.

11:08.736 --> 11:10.003
- Do you think
that's big enough?

11:10.037 --> 11:12.906

a drink out of that?

11:12.940 --> 11:15.776
- No, I stopped it
before it got to the table.

11:15.809 --> 11:17.310
- Awfully low.
- And that's low.

what Scheana's up to lately?

11:32.359 --> 11:33.794
I've been really busy

11:33.827 --> 11:35.796
and not preoccupied
with Scheana.

this infertile fertile...

11:38.365 --> 11:39.900

11:41.001 --> 11:42.269

where you freeze your eggs.

right now.

all summer long.

really hard.

11:50.043 --> 11:51.244

really hard on something,

11:53.046 --> 11:54.748

it's their relationship,

11:54.782 --> 11:55.949
'cause he's always
at "the studio."

11:55.983 --> 11:57.885
- You've always been very
cynical about their marriage.

could do a lot better.

I've always said that,
but you know what?

12:01.889 --> 12:03.924

my business.

about our friendship.

I'm worried about making happy

15:40.207 --> 15:41.641
- Awesome.

15:41.674 --> 15:45.078
*

15:45.112 --> 15:46.479
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:46.513 --> 15:47.647
- What's going on?

15:47.680 --> 15:50.017
- Will you make me
a tall vodka soda,

15:50.050 --> 15:51.218
please, for my table?

15:51.251 --> 15:53.086
- Yeah.

15:53.120 --> 15:55.222
- I was talking to Kristen,
and she was talking about,

15:55.255 --> 15:57.424
like, who was walking
down the aisle with who.

15:57.457 --> 16:01.228
And I was like, "Aren't
Tom's brothers in it?"

16:01.261 --> 16:02.529
- Why would you say that?

16:03.563 --> 16:04.597
- And she said,
"No, I don't think so," and--

16:05.532 --> 16:07.534
- Wait, wait, wait.
Why would you say that?

16:07.567 --> 16:09.569
This is a surprise.
Nobody knows.

16:09.602 --> 16:11.771
Why would Brittany
tell Kristen?

16:11.804 --> 16:14.207
I mean, she's got
a bigger mouth than I do.

16:14.241 --> 16:15.742
Kristen, of all people, knows.

16:15.775 --> 16:16.709
- I think she'll be fine.

16:16.743 --> 16:19.046
- She'll be like this:
"Tom, I know something."

16:19.079 --> 16:21.481
- Honey, you have the biggest
blabbermouth of anybody.

16:21.514 --> 16:24.084
- If this surprise gets ruined,
I will be crushed.

16:24.117 --> 16:25.185
- It will not be ruined.

16:25.218 --> 16:26.653
- I'm upset.
I'm sorry. I'm upset.

16:26.686 --> 16:28.755
- Okay, well, calm down.
You're at work.

16:28.788 --> 16:31.758
[light music]

16:31.791 --> 16:36.563
*

16:36.596 --> 16:39.599
- Hello.
- Hi!

16:39.632 --> 16:41.534
- These flowers
are for you, then.

16:41.568 --> 16:42.669
Brought some wine as well.

16:43.736 --> 16:44.571
- Sunflowers are my favorite.
How did you know?

16:45.438 --> 16:46.439
- They are? I had no idea.
- Did too.

16:47.607 --> 16:48.175
- I've met Raquel's family
a bunch of times.

16:48.808 --> 16:49.476
We get along great.

16:50.477 --> 16:51.044
They're always really
welcoming,

16:52.345 --> 16:53.113
and it's nice to have, like,
that family environment.

16:54.147 --> 16:55.448
They're really supportive
of our relationship.

16:56.383 --> 16:57.450
Can I have some of this
blood orange soda?

16:58.318 --> 16:58.718
- You can have
whatever you want.

16:59.652 --> 17:01.621
- Where exactly is
Raquel's dad at right now?

17:01.654 --> 17:02.689
- He just left Alaska.

17:02.722 --> 17:04.291
He was up there for two months.

17:04.324 --> 17:07.194
He was kayaking
and looking for grizzly bears.

17:07.227 --> 17:09.129
- I'm starving right now.

17:09.162 --> 17:10.197
- We can eat.
- Yay!

17:11.264 --> 17:12.565
- Do you want me to bring this
to the table for you?

17:13.466 --> 17:14.467
- Yeah, I have to get
the salad too.

17:15.468 --> 17:16.035
- Dating Raquel is just
a world of difference

17:16.569 --> 17:17.237
compared to Kristen.

17:18.405 --> 17:19.572
I mean, Raquel is beautiful,
loving, patient.

17:19.606 --> 17:20.573
She's my queen.

17:20.607 --> 17:21.641
And Kristen, I mean,

17:21.674 --> 17:23.176
she's more like this hooker

17:23.210 --> 17:25.212
that you f--- on the hood
of a BMW

17:25.245 --> 17:27.580
in, like, your car park.

17:27.614 --> 17:28.681
- James, you want to serve?

17:28.715 --> 17:30.117
- Yes!
Let's make him do it.

17:30.150 --> 17:31.684
'Cause I'll drop it
all over the table.

17:31.718 --> 17:33.120
You should be good at this

17:33.153 --> 17:34.721
since you work
in a restaurant.

17:34.754 --> 17:37.557
- You know, I wasn't a server.
I wasn't good enough for that.

17:37.590 --> 17:38.791
- So then you were doing
the dishes?

17:38.825 --> 17:42.162
- I was a busser, so, yeah,
dishes were part of the thing.

17:42.195 --> 17:44.197
- How long were you bussing
at Sur?

17:44.231 --> 17:47.534
- As interesting
as the story is

17:47.567 --> 17:49.536
about Sur and Pump,
you know...

17:49.569 --> 17:51.104
[laughs nervously]

17:51.138 --> 17:52.205
Sorry, nervous laugh.

17:52.239 --> 17:53.340
I just wanted to get clear

17:53.373 --> 17:57.110
that I actually don't work
at Sur or Pump right now.

17:57.144 --> 18:00.347
You know, I kind of
got fired from the place.

18:00.380 --> 18:01.281
- [gasps]

18:01.314 --> 18:03.650
- I'm not exactly
on good terms with Lisa.

18:03.683 --> 18:05.118
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

18:05.152 --> 18:06.319
So what did you do?

18:06.353 --> 18:08.355
- I kept getting into,
like...

18:08.388 --> 18:09.656
situations.

18:10.723 --> 18:11.824
- You can't go a day
without getting your ass kicked.

18:12.825 --> 18:14.093
- 'Cause I'm a rock star
and you're a bartender.

18:14.894 --> 18:16.796
They need to get
more cosmopolitans!

18:16.829 --> 18:18.565
Pumptini!

18:18.598 --> 18:21.734
- You're turning into an asshole
before my very eyes.

18:21.768 --> 18:25.572
- I got, like, in a headlock
at some point.

18:25.605 --> 18:27.540
- Seriously or joking around?

18:28.775 --> 18:31.211
- Seriously.
- Oh, my gosh.

18:32.945 --> 18:35.615
- I've just got another gig

18:35.648 --> 18:38.618
at a new restaurant
that's coming out on Melrose,

18:38.651 --> 18:41.754
and I haven't been drinking
for a little while,

18:41.788 --> 18:45.192
and, you know, it's really put
what truly matters to me

18:45.225 --> 18:47.327
in perspective,
and that is, you know,

18:47.360 --> 18:48.661
your daughter especially.

18:48.695 --> 18:49.696
- Aw.

18:50.597 --> 18:51.564
- And I just want
to promise you both

18:52.432 --> 18:54.201
that, you know,
I love her so much,

18:54.234 --> 18:56.169
and I love you guys as well.

18:56.203 --> 18:57.670
And just having
other family there,

18:57.704 --> 18:59.272
it means a lot to me.

18:59.306 --> 19:01.841
This whole summer has just been
full of loss for me.

19:01.874 --> 19:03.943
Dealing with my parents
breaking up

19:03.976 --> 19:04.010
has just been really hard
for me.

19:05.845 --> 19:07.914
I had to deal
with me leaving Sur,

19:07.947 --> 19:10.383
Sur leaving me,
whatever you want to call that.

19:10.417 --> 19:11.784
I just wanted to make sure

19:11.818 --> 19:13.820
that you guys, you know,
really do trust me,

19:13.853 --> 19:15.388
because there's not really
any reason to--

19:15.422 --> 19:18.258
- We've gotten to know you
this summer, so we do.

19:18.291 --> 19:19.626
- Aw.
- Sorry.

19:19.659 --> 19:20.793
You know, I love Raquel.

19:21.894 --> 19:22.995
I see myself being with her
for the rest of my life.

19:23.029 --> 19:26.433
And as much as people want
to put me down

19:26.466 --> 19:29.702
or put my relationship down
or not believe in me,

19:29.736 --> 19:31.871
you know, I don't care
what the people are saying,

19:31.904 --> 19:34.241
because I see my future
with her right now.

19:34.274 --> 19:36.743
- I want to propose a toast,
'cause we really love you.

19:36.776 --> 19:37.844
You're an awesome person,

19:37.877 --> 19:39.646
and you treat her
like a princess,

19:39.679 --> 19:42.349
and she loves you,
and that's what matters to me.

19:42.382 --> 19:44.217
I'm glad you're...
- Part of the family.

19:44.251 --> 19:47.387
- Yeah, to family.
- We do love you.

19:47.420 --> 19:50.257
- So cheers.
Thanks for coming for dinner.

19:50.290 --> 19:51.891
I'm glad he came.

20:03.903 --> 20:05.872
- * Never knew
that I was capable *

20:06.706 --> 20:08.708
* But this is unmistakable

20:08.741 --> 20:11.544
* Love

20:11.578 --> 20:13.713
- How much time do we have
before we have to leave?

20:13.746 --> 20:15.348
- Like, maybe 30 minutes.

20:15.382 --> 20:17.450
- Holy sh--, 30 minutes?

20:17.484 --> 20:18.718
[sighs]

20:18.751 --> 20:21.488
We've dotted our Ts.
We've crossed our Is.

20:21.521 --> 20:23.723
We've got pretty much
everything in order.

20:23.756 --> 20:26.359
I got my shoes,
groomsmen bowtie.

20:26.393 --> 20:27.193
What else do we need?

20:27.226 --> 20:29.596
Now all we got to do
is go up there

20:29.629 --> 20:31.331
and do the damn thing.

20:31.364 --> 20:32.399
Look at this sexy-ass cake.

20:32.432 --> 20:34.801
I want to go "American Pie"
style on this thing.

20:34.834 --> 20:35.902
- Set it right there.

20:36.936 --> 20:38.571
We could put some dry ice
underneath it, actually.

20:38.605 --> 20:40.907
- Ooh, cake, cake.

20:40.940 --> 20:42.942
All right, what do you guys
need help with?

20:42.975 --> 20:44.711
- Should I get this now?
- Yeah.

20:44.744 --> 20:47.347
- I'm scared.
- I'm scared for you.

20:47.380 --> 20:49.516
You don't wear flip-flops

20:49.549 --> 20:51.818
when you're holding
precious cargo like a cake.

20:51.851 --> 20:53.520
Got it?
- Yeah.

20:53.553 --> 20:55.588
I don't want to trip
over the doggy's--

20:55.622 --> 20:56.723
Ooh.
Whoa.

20:56.756 --> 20:58.725
Oh, my God, dude.

20:58.758 --> 21:00.660
Holy f---ing sh--.

21:00.693 --> 21:03.630
- Wear shoes with laces
like a normal cake carrier.

21:03.663 --> 21:05.965
- Dude, I cannot believe
I f---ing missed a step.

21:05.998 --> 21:09.369
That's a big-ass piñata.
Jesus.

21:09.402 --> 21:12.539
- Knowing Tom and Katie,
that piñata is probably filled

21:12.572 --> 21:14.841
with condoms and gummy bears,

21:14.874 --> 21:16.709
Ninja Turtle action figures,

21:16.743 --> 21:18.611
maybe some weed.

21:18.645 --> 21:20.413
For funsies.

21:20.447 --> 21:21.981
Okay, I'm gonna record
you guys.

21:22.014 --> 21:23.850
This is the last time
you're gonna be

21:23.883 --> 21:25.818
at your apartment fiancés.

21:25.852 --> 21:27.720
Bye! I'll see you
when I get there!

21:27.754 --> 21:29.456
- Oh, sh--,
hit him in the head.

21:29.489 --> 21:30.590
Katie and I decided to drive,

21:30.623 --> 21:31.858
because we have a lot of stuff

21:31.891 --> 21:33.726
that we need to bring
up to the wedding.

21:33.760 --> 21:35.662
Aren't we supposed to tie, like,
empty Coke cans

21:35.695 --> 21:36.929
or empty soda cans to our car?

21:36.963 --> 21:38.765
- That's when you guys--
if you guys make it

21:38.798 --> 21:39.766
past the wedding.

21:39.799 --> 21:40.867
- "If"?
- It's a joke.

21:40.900 --> 21:41.901
- Is that a Freudian slip?

21:41.934 --> 21:43.803
Plus, we like taking road trips
together,

21:43.836 --> 21:45.872
especially 'cause
I don't have to drive.

21:45.905 --> 21:47.740
She insists on driving.

21:47.774 --> 21:48.741
- Bye!

21:48.775 --> 21:50.009
- I love you.
- Love you too.

21:50.042 --> 21:51.411
- Bye, Stass.
- Bye.

21:51.444 --> 21:53.012
- See you up there.

21:53.045 --> 21:56.516
[upbeat music]

21:56.549 --> 21:59.519
[laidback music]

21:59.552 --> 22:01.754
*

22:01.788 --> 22:03.790
- Hi, ladies.
How are the goat cheese balls?

22:05.525 --> 22:07.660
- Well, hi.

22:08.995 --> 22:10.897
What are you doing?

22:10.930 --> 22:12.832
- What the f---?

22:12.865 --> 22:15.835
The last time I saw Lala
was two months ago.

22:15.868 --> 22:17.970
- I apologize.
I have a gift for you.

22:18.004 --> 22:20.507
Um, yeah.
All right.

22:20.540 --> 22:21.641
Thank you guys.

22:21.674 --> 22:23.476
- And then she just disappeared

22:23.510 --> 22:24.777
off the face of the Earth.

22:24.811 --> 22:26.613
Seriously?

22:26.646 --> 22:29.048
I don't remember sending
for you, bitch.

22:29.081 --> 22:31.951
Yeah, you been, like...
gone, right?

22:31.984 --> 22:34.521
- Yeah, I went back to Utah
for, like, three weeks,

22:34.554 --> 22:36.756
and then my mom came
out here for a week.

22:36.789 --> 22:38.458
That's about it, though.

22:38.491 --> 22:40.026
I've missed you, man.

22:40.059 --> 22:43.696
There are so many things
that I've been wanting to say

22:43.730 --> 22:46.666
to Ariana,
and I haven't wanted to do it

22:46.699 --> 22:48.835
over texts or over the phone.

22:48.868 --> 22:50.637
I've been feeling
a little bit badly

22:50.670 --> 22:51.871
about everything, but--

22:53.072 --> 22:55.742
- Yeah, I haven't talked to you
since you went back to Utah.

22:55.775 --> 22:58.511
- I just want her to see
that I'm serious

22:58.545 --> 23:00.980
about how sorry I am.

23:01.013 --> 23:03.583
I've been, obviously,
embarrassed

23:03.616 --> 23:06.085
of my actions
and how I handled things

23:06.118 --> 23:08.955
as far as not showing up
to your birthday.

23:08.988 --> 23:12.959
But I really do feel like
you've...

23:12.992 --> 23:14.694
been a good friend to me.

23:14.727 --> 23:19.098
And I'm sorry about the way
that I handled things.

23:19.131 --> 23:21.100
Sometimes when I go
through things,

23:21.133 --> 23:22.201
I just go into shutdown mode.

23:22.234 --> 23:27.540
I do it to everybody,
and that 's why I'm so thankful

23:27.574 --> 23:29.709
for the friends that I do have,
'cause I'm like

23:29.742 --> 23:33.012
it takes
a really nice human being

23:33.045 --> 23:34.681
to be friends with me.

23:34.714 --> 23:37.550
- I was never gonna, like,
just not be your friend.

23:37.584 --> 23:38.951
But then I didn't hear
from you,

23:38.985 --> 23:42.955
so then I, you know,
didn't really know

23:42.989 --> 23:44.991
what that was about.

23:45.024 --> 23:46.893
I would love to give Lala
a chance

23:46.926 --> 23:48.995
to show me and other people

23:49.028 --> 23:52.899
that she's not who she's shown
herself to be this summer.

23:52.932 --> 23:54.867
But you can't just, like,
roll up

23:54.901 --> 23:56.503
like nothing ever happened

23:57.670 --> 23:59.539
and act like we're just gonna
pick our friendship back up.

23:59.572 --> 24:01.140
That's not gonna happen.

24:01.173 --> 24:06.012
- I'm coming in
to officially let Lisa know

24:06.045 --> 24:08.715
that I won't be hostessing here
anymore.

24:08.748 --> 24:11.083
- I think she may have
figured that out

24:11.117 --> 24:12.619
over the...
[laughs]

24:12.652 --> 24:14.887
- Last few...
- Two months?

24:14.921 --> 24:15.955
- Yeah.

24:15.988 --> 24:18.057
- She probably feels
disrespected.

24:18.090 --> 24:19.726
- Is she in there right now?

24:19.759 --> 24:21.828
- Mm-mm.
- Oh, God. Oh, God.

24:21.861 --> 24:24.030
I don't know if you pray,
but if you do,

24:24.063 --> 24:26.032
could you maybe say one
for me real quick?

24:26.065 --> 24:28.768
- I'll, like, manifest
some...

24:28.801 --> 24:29.969
- Send me just good vibes.

24:30.002 --> 24:31.604
- All right.
Good luck.

24:31.638 --> 24:32.639
Fingers crossed.

24:34.006 --> 24:35.942
Oh, man.

24:41.147 --> 24:42.649
- Hi, Lisa.

24:44.684 --> 24:47.787
Are you surprised to see me
after so long?

24:47.820 --> 24:50.089
- Yes, I am.

24:50.122 --> 24:51.157
Bloody hell.

24:51.190 --> 24:52.792
Stone the crows.

24:52.825 --> 24:55.795
Miss Kent is back.

24:59.999 --> 25:02.134
What the hell happened?

25:02.168 --> 25:03.936
- When I get into a mind-set--

25:03.970 --> 25:05.838
and this is one of
my biggest flaws--

25:05.872 --> 25:07.206
I completely shut down.

25:07.239 --> 25:10.610
I say, basically,
"F you" to everybody,

25:10.643 --> 25:12.211
and I do what I want to do.

25:12.244 --> 25:14.914
- You sound like
you're proud of it.

25:14.947 --> 25:16.148
- No, I'm owning it.

25:16.182 --> 25:17.684
Like, for the first time--

25:17.717 --> 25:20.086
- If you own it,
it doesn't change the fact

25:20.119 --> 25:21.954
that you're letting people down.

25:21.988 --> 25:24.123
I stuck with you,
and I supported you,

25:24.156 --> 25:25.892
and I gave you a job here,

25:25.925 --> 25:29.228
and you just didn't even have
not one iota

25:29.261 --> 25:33.900
of actually respect for me.

25:33.933 --> 25:35.134
I really had Lala's back.

25:35.167 --> 25:37.103
I really supported her.

25:37.136 --> 25:38.838
I was there for that girl.

25:38.871 --> 25:40.840
And then we were screwed
by Lala.

25:40.873 --> 25:43.710
You cannot walk away
from your responsibilities.

25:43.743 --> 25:44.911
- And that's why I'm here,

25:44.944 --> 25:47.647
because I feel
absolutely embarrassed and awful

25:47.680 --> 25:48.748
that I left everybody hanging.

25:48.781 --> 25:50.850
- Now, it doesn't matter now,
because guess what.

25:50.883 --> 25:51.884
Sur survived without you.

25:51.918 --> 25:53.953
It survived before,
and it will survive after.

25:53.986 --> 25:55.054
- I agree.

25:56.055 --> 25:57.223
- Sometimes honesty
can be the best policy,

25:58.157 --> 25:59.859
and I think here
you weren't totally honest

25:59.892 --> 26:01.794
with what was going on
in your life,

26:01.828 --> 26:03.195
and I think
there lies the problem.

26:03.229 --> 26:04.931
- I don't feel like
anybody is worthy

26:04.964 --> 26:07.166
about hearing about my life
and what I'm going through.

26:07.199 --> 26:09.736
- That's fine with that.
Keep your life private.

26:09.769 --> 26:13.072
But it's when you lie to people
that they're gonna call you out.

26:13.105 --> 26:16.175
[dramatic music]

26:16.208 --> 26:19.245
- I don't know how to handle
things sometimes, Lisa,

26:19.278 --> 26:21.681
and I'm trying really hard.

26:21.714 --> 26:25.752
- Lala, you disappeared
off the face of the Earth.

26:25.785 --> 26:27.119
Nobody knew where you were.

26:27.153 --> 26:30.823
- I suffer from anxiety.
It's just a fact of life.

26:33.926 --> 26:36.896
I don't want to say that.
I'm not a psycho person.

26:36.929 --> 26:39.999
But I don't think the same way
some people do.

26:40.032 --> 26:42.835
I have anxiety to the point

26:42.869 --> 26:45.705
where it prevents me from doing
a lot of things.

26:45.738 --> 26:49.208
Unless you've been there,
you can't even explain it.

26:49.241 --> 26:52.211
That's when I really, really
just need my family

26:52.244 --> 26:55.281
to bring me back up, because
no medication in the world

26:55.314 --> 26:57.717
is going to pull you
out of that.

26:57.750 --> 26:59.786
- All I wanted
is the best for you,

26:59.819 --> 27:01.854
and if this isn't
the right place for you,

27:01.888 --> 27:02.889
I understand that.

27:02.922 --> 27:03.956
Do you understand that?

27:03.990 --> 27:05.992
- I do understand that.

27:06.025 --> 27:07.760
- You've got to grow
from this, Lala.

27:07.794 --> 27:08.861
- I know.

27:08.895 --> 27:10.096
- Lala's entire strategy

27:10.129 --> 27:12.164
is being young and pretty.

27:12.198 --> 27:13.766
That's not gonna last forever.

27:13.800 --> 27:15.702
- I'll be all right.

27:17.103 --> 27:19.071
- Well, you should
keep in touch.

27:19.105 --> 27:22.842
- Yeah.
- Go on, then.

27:25.344 --> 27:27.914
- I don't want to, like,
hit you with the bill.

27:27.947 --> 27:30.216
I just wanted to make sure
that you were comfortable.

27:30.249 --> 27:32.852
Maybe "comfortable"
isn't the right word.

[upbeat music]

27:43.295 --> 27:46.733

27:46.766 --> 27:48.234
- There's a lot of people here
I haven't seen in a while--

27:48.267 --> 27:49.035
you know, I don't get to spend

27:49.068 --> 27:51.871
a lot of time with,
so I'm excited.

27:51.904 --> 27:54.273
I'm sad my dad's not here,
but it's okay.

27:54.306 --> 27:56.943
I miss my brothers too,
but it's okay.

27:56.976 --> 27:58.878
I don't ever want
to see you fret

27:58.911 --> 28:01.380
for the next 48 hours, Bubba.

*

28:09.321 --> 28:10.356
- We're driving up, right?

28:11.290 --> 28:11.791
- Katie and Tom
are driving up,

28:12.591 --> 28:13.359
'cause they're bringing
the dogs,

28:14.326 --> 28:14.994
and they're bringing, like,
all the alcohol

28:15.627 --> 28:16.362
and, like, all that stuff.

28:17.296 --> 28:18.765
And Rachael and Stassi
are also driving up.

28:18.798 --> 28:19.932
- Okay.

28:21.000 --> 28:22.434
- And the six of us
will all be there together.

28:22.468 --> 28:25.805
Everyone else is coming in
the next day.

28:25.838 --> 28:28.307
- Hopefully, they have
a good drive up.

28:28.340 --> 28:30.509
- Yeah, but then they can just,
like, have alone time

28:30.542 --> 28:31.477
before they're, like,
overwhelmed

28:31.510 --> 28:33.445
with friends and family
and wedding party...

28:33.479 --> 28:34.914
- That's true.
I think that's good.

28:34.947 --> 28:36.849
- They can just, like,
hang out together and--

28:36.883 --> 28:37.950
Wait, do you know about--

28:37.984 --> 28:40.953
[gasps] I didn't tell you this.
- What?

28:40.987 --> 28:42.855
- Do you know
about Schwartz's brothers?

28:42.889 --> 28:45.291
- No.
- [whispers] They're coming.

28:45.324 --> 28:46.325
- Shut up.

28:47.226 --> 28:48.427
- Sandoval and Jax
are surprising him.

28:48.460 --> 28:49.195
- No way.

28:49.228 --> 28:50.863
- I wasn't supposed
to tell you.

28:50.897 --> 28:51.931
I wasn't supposed
to tell anybody,

28:51.964 --> 28:54.801
because I found out
as a little bit of a fluke.

28:54.834 --> 28:56.402
- What?
- He's gonna cry.

28:56.435 --> 28:58.070
They're gonna cry.

28:58.104 --> 29:00.506
- So exciting.
That's so exciting!

29:00.539 --> 29:04.343
[light music]

29:04.376 --> 29:06.846
- We are in the woods.

29:06.879 --> 29:08.280
- Whoa, what is that?
A bear!

29:08.314 --> 29:09.448
Holy sh--.

29:09.481 --> 29:11.350
- I see him. He's looking.
- Oh, yeah!

29:11.383 --> 29:13.352
- That was the first bear
I've ever seen.

29:13.385 --> 29:15.087
- There's bears
all over West Hollywood.

29:15.121 --> 29:21.760

Holy sh--, we've been

29:26.132 --> 29:27.834
We did it, Bubbie.

29:27.867 --> 29:30.102
- Hi, guys.
- Oh, my God.

29:30.136 --> 29:31.804
- Welcome.
- You made it.

29:31.838 --> 29:32.939
- You drove the whole way?

29:32.972 --> 29:34.073
Katie!

29:34.106 --> 29:36.342
- Oh, my God.
- Nice to have you here.

29:36.375 --> 29:38.444
- Hey, what's happening?
You guys.

29:38.477 --> 29:39.578
- Good to see you.

29:39.611 --> 29:41.480
- I know it's not ideal
for some people

29:41.513 --> 29:44.917
to get married in the woods
and stay in rustic cabins.

29:44.951 --> 29:46.819
- We can grab your cake.

29:46.853 --> 29:48.520
- All right.

29:48.554 --> 29:50.589
- Oh, my God.

29:50.622 --> 29:53.525
- Oh, yeah, it looks good.
- Yeah.

29:53.559 --> 29:55.995
- But for me, that is perfect.

29:56.028 --> 29:58.064
That is exactly what we wanted.

29:58.097 --> 29:59.866
And it's all real now.

29:59.899 --> 30:02.001
- When you're carrying a cake,
you're hyperaware of every step.

30:02.034 --> 30:04.871
- All right, we're gonna go put
this in the fridge, you guys.

30:04.904 --> 30:08.407
*

30:08.440 --> 30:11.543
- So I know you're tired
and all of that,

30:11.577 --> 30:14.146
and I don't want to, like,
hit you with the bill.

30:14.180 --> 30:15.147
- Oh.
- However...

30:15.181 --> 30:16.348
- Whoa.

30:16.382 --> 30:17.583
- I just wanted to make sure

30:17.616 --> 30:19.118
that you were, you know,
comfortable

30:19.151 --> 30:20.887
with all of this
and that you--

30:20.920 --> 30:22.955
Maybe "comfortable"
isn't the right word.

30:22.989 --> 30:24.957
"Accepting"?
- Okay, yeah.

30:24.991 --> 30:26.959
- So we had
the base package cost,

30:26.993 --> 30:29.896
which was $5,495.

30:29.929 --> 30:31.964
Your rehearsal dinner,
that's $4,000.

30:31.998 --> 30:34.100
And then we've got
the three nights' accommodation

30:34.133 --> 30:35.534
at $1,495 a night.

30:35.567 --> 30:39.872
So then the big one
were the flower additions.

30:39.906 --> 30:44.877
There was an extra $10,150.

30:44.911 --> 30:46.378
- Yeah.
- Sorry.

30:46.412 --> 30:47.479
It's our wedding,

30:47.513 --> 30:49.448
and I wanted it to be perfect,

30:49.481 --> 30:51.550
and I wanted to have
certain things,

30:51.583 --> 30:53.452
and they cost money.

30:53.485 --> 30:59.425
- So then the grand total
is $51,058.

30:59.458 --> 31:03.062
- F--- me.

31:03.095 --> 31:06.465
I think I'm gonna cry.

31:06.498 --> 31:07.967
- All right.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.501
- I came up with, like,
you know,

31:09.535 --> 31:10.602
this arbitrary number,

31:10.636 --> 31:12.038
this sort of
pie-in-the-sky figure

31:12.071 --> 31:13.940
just to make a point on how much

31:13.973 --> 31:15.474
I would never spend
on a wedding.

31:15.507 --> 31:18.477
If it gets up to, like, 50,
I'm not gonna enjoy the wedding.

31:18.510 --> 31:19.478
- No, it's not.

31:19.511 --> 31:20.579
- Katie was right;

31:20.612 --> 31:23.215
in this case,
we didn't spend $50,000.

31:23.249 --> 31:26.485
We spent $51,058.

31:28.220 --> 31:30.122
- [sighs]
Well...

31:30.156 --> 31:31.657
- I feel like...
Yeah. Yeah.

31:31.690 --> 31:33.192
I need a drink.

31:33.225 --> 31:35.227
- Let's go to the car,
grab some booze,

31:35.261 --> 31:37.496
make a drink,
look for the checks...

31:37.529 --> 31:38.965
- Look for the check.
- Chill.

31:38.998 --> 31:39.999
- Chill.
- Chill.

31:40.032 --> 31:41.467
- And pay you.
Then chill.

31:41.500 --> 31:43.202
- You write a check for 20.
I'll do--

31:43.235 --> 31:44.470
- Dollars?

31:44.503 --> 31:46.672
It's not funny.
- Yeah.

31:48.674 --> 31:50.609
- Do you have your checkbook?

31:50.642 --> 31:52.444
Okay, I couldn't find mine,
but...

31:52.478 --> 31:55.647
- Oh, my God.
- I can do the electronic pay.

31:55.681 --> 31:58.117
- I just want to get
this stuff over with

31:58.150 --> 31:59.151
so I can chill.

31:59.185 --> 32:00.586
- Hello.
- [gasps]

32:00.619 --> 32:02.654
- Hello.
- Yeah!

32:02.688 --> 32:06.125
Welcome.
[people cheering]

32:06.158 --> 32:07.659

32:07.693 --> 32:09.628
- Mrs. Schwartz
and Mr. Schwartz.

32:09.661 --> 32:12.264
- You're Mr. Maloney.
- I'm not Mr. Maloney.

32:12.298 --> 32:12.331
- There he is.
- Your timing's impeccable.

32:14.533 --> 32:15.667
- How we doing?

32:16.802 --> 32:17.970
- As excited as I am
about this wedding,

32:18.004 --> 32:19.105
I can't help but think,

32:19.138 --> 32:22.041
as I'm writing
this $20,000 check,

32:22.074 --> 32:25.978
that's exactly how much I owe
on my student loans.

32:26.012 --> 32:29.281
I could be debt free.
I could be clear of debt.

32:29.315 --> 32:31.583
And that would be
such a beautiful thing.

32:31.617 --> 32:34.286
Instead, I'm writing
a $20,000 check

32:34.320 --> 32:38.024
for, like, some flowers
and a buffet.

32:38.057 --> 32:39.558
Man, the things we do for love.

32:39.591 --> 32:41.027
- Thank you.
It's gonna be great.

32:41.060 --> 32:41.994
- All right.
- Have fun tonight.

32:42.028 --> 32:43.729
-Thanks again, Kevin.
- See you tomorrow.

32:43.762 --> 32:45.764
- We're gonna get drunk now.
- Rehearsal's gonna be great.

32:45.797 --> 32:47.733
- Bye, Kevin. See you tomorrow.
- Bye, Kevin.

32:47.766 --> 32:50.102
- You guys, can I actually make
a nice little toast?

32:50.136 --> 32:52.238
You're really expensive,
but I love you.

32:52.271 --> 32:53.772
- And?
- And worth it.

32:53.805 --> 32:55.607
Oh, yeah, worth it,
totally.

32:57.709 --> 33:00.046
- Hashtag wilderness.
- Oh, my God.

33:00.079 --> 33:01.680
- Hello.
- Yes!

33:01.713 --> 33:04.183
Ohh!

33:04.216 --> 33:05.651
- Let me help you with that.

33:05.684 --> 33:07.619
That's amazing.
- What's wrong?

33:07.653 --> 33:09.721
- I need a big hug.

33:10.756 --> 33:13.059
- I'm so happy you're here.

33:13.092 --> 33:15.694
[various conversations]

33:15.727 --> 33:17.729
- We lost service for an hour.
- It's no joke.

33:17.763 --> 33:19.298
- We tried pulling in
to somebody's house,

33:19.331 --> 33:20.599
and I'm like, "No.

33:20.632 --> 33:23.035
It's probably
a f---ing murderer."

33:23.069 --> 33:25.604
Rachael and I almost, like,
died.

33:25.637 --> 33:26.738
Are we going the right way?

33:26.772 --> 33:28.274
- I have no idea.

33:28.307 --> 33:31.210
- I don't have a signal anymore,
so I can't--

33:31.243 --> 33:33.745
I'm not getting, like,
the turn-by-turn directions.

33:33.779 --> 33:36.315
It's pitch black.
No service at all.

33:36.348 --> 33:38.684
We, like, navigate our way
to the wedding

33:38.717 --> 33:40.752
by, like, looking at the stars.

33:40.786 --> 33:41.853
I can't die single!

33:41.887 --> 33:44.556
There's so many things
that, like, I haven't done.

33:44.590 --> 33:45.757
I've never had a threesome.

33:45.791 --> 33:46.792
- Ew!

33:46.825 --> 33:49.161
- There are signs everywhere
that children painted,

33:49.195 --> 33:51.063
and I'm like,
"What the f--- is this?"

33:51.097 --> 33:52.631
- It looks like Arrowhead.

33:52.664 --> 33:54.366
- It's scarier like Arrowhead.

33:54.400 --> 33:55.801
Like, Arrowhead
has street lights.

33:55.834 --> 33:57.136
- We saw a bear.

33:57.169 --> 33:58.637
- Yo, we need a cocktail.

33:58.670 --> 34:00.239
It was an experience.

34:00.272 --> 34:01.540
And no one cared.

34:02.574 --> 34:04.110
- You missed the worst part.
We had to pay for it.

34:04.143 --> 34:05.377
- Like, just, like, a check?
- Yeah.

34:05.411 --> 34:08.080
- Do I have to cut my own hole
into this guy?

34:08.114 --> 34:09.215
- I don't know.

34:09.248 --> 34:10.682
- I don't know
the piñata rules.

34:12.118 --> 34:14.253
I can't believe everything that
this group has been through--

34:14.286 --> 34:17.123
the fights and the breakups
and the reconciliations

34:17.156 --> 34:20.326
and the fun times
and the tears and everything--

34:20.359 --> 34:22.394
and here we are all together.

34:22.428 --> 34:23.795
I think that's a testament

34:23.829 --> 34:27.799
to how much we do care
and love each other.

34:27.833 --> 34:30.202
99 Bananas.
- I bought those.

34:30.236 --> 34:31.170
- Yeah!

34:32.037 --> 34:32.838
- I used to drink those
in high school.

34:33.705 --> 34:35.307
I got one of my first
hand jobs on that.

34:35.341 --> 34:38.144
- I feel lucky to have
a family--

34:38.177 --> 34:39.778
or a framily, I'll call it.

34:39.811 --> 34:42.281
Do you guys want rosé,
or do you want tequila?

34:42.314 --> 34:43.782
- I want wine.

34:43.815 --> 34:46.118
- Oh, my God, this is gonna be
so much fun.

34:47.219 --> 34:48.354
- Can't believe
we're actually here

34:48.387 --> 34:49.421
and it's actually happening.

34:49.455 --> 34:51.823
And I'm bloody ordaining it.
How did this happen?

34:51.857 --> 34:53.725
- He hasn't married her yet.
- Oh, shut up.

35:00.532 --> 35:03.302
- * Let my love shine,
let it shine *

35:03.835 --> 35:05.237
* Shine

35:06.405 --> 35:07.606
* Let my love shine,
let my love shine *

35:07.639 --> 35:08.840
* Let it shine

35:08.874 --> 35:11.410
- Like, it literally smells
like an anus.

35:11.443 --> 35:12.511
- I think it smells delicious.

35:12.544 --> 35:13.845
Are you sure you fogot
hot sauce?

35:13.879 --> 35:16.748
- Look at you.
- Hey!

35:16.782 --> 35:18.484
- Hi.
- Look at you guys.

35:18.517 --> 35:19.851
Too many cooks in the kitchen.

35:19.885 --> 35:21.620
- Kristen has a present
for you, Schwartz.

35:21.653 --> 35:23.289
- Oh, is that for me?
For real?

35:23.322 --> 35:24.790
- Put it on, Katie.
- F---in'.

35:24.823 --> 35:26.858
all: Yeah!
- Stasi.

35:26.892 --> 35:28.494
- You guys...
- Yeah?

35:28.527 --> 35:31.430
- Guess who forgot their suit.
- Sandoval.

35:31.463 --> 35:34.433
- And missed his flight.
- Are you serious?

35:34.466 --> 35:36.568
- Missing a flight because of
a wardrobe malfunction

35:36.602 --> 35:39.438
is the most Tom Sandoval thing
of all time.

35:39.471 --> 35:39.505
He's probably
gonna miss tubing,

35:40.939 --> 35:42.908
which really sucks, 'cause
he was super excited about it.

35:42.941 --> 35:45.877
- Oh!
- I'm hungry.

35:45.911 --> 35:48.647
- The bride to be
wants a piece of bacon.

35:48.680 --> 35:50.516
- Holy sh--.
That's perfectly cooked.

35:50.549 --> 35:52.318
Let me get a bite of that.

35:52.351 --> 35:53.419
- Mm-mm.
Get your own.

35:53.452 --> 35:54.653
- Can't wait to see Wild Bill.

35:54.686 --> 35:56.922
- He's not coming.
I didn't tell you?

35:56.955 --> 35:58.524
- Why?
- He can't fly.

35:58.557 --> 36:00.526
Like, he just gets
really bad anxiety.

36:00.559 --> 36:02.328
Of course I want everybody
out there,

36:02.361 --> 36:03.562
but my dad can't make it,

36:04.763 --> 36:05.597
because he has, like,
a real fear of flying.

36:06.265 --> 36:07.599
And then I have my brothers,

36:08.767 --> 36:09.835
and, you know, money's just
a little tight right now.

36:11.036 --> 36:12.671
And then I have my sister,
who can't come because of work.

36:12.704 --> 36:14.740
I get to see him, like,
once a year.

36:14.773 --> 36:16.442
It's not enough.
I miss him.

36:16.475 --> 36:20.746
*

36:20.779 --> 36:23.349
- I overpacked.
We're going for three days.

36:23.382 --> 36:24.416
- Three days?
- Yeah.

36:24.450 --> 36:27.553
- I'm pretty excited for
Tom's brothers to get there.

36:27.586 --> 36:28.887
- I know.
- If they make it.

36:28.920 --> 36:30.956
I hope they make it.
- Why wouldn't they make it?

36:30.989 --> 36:33.359
- I just hope they're reliable,
they can get there.

36:33.392 --> 36:36.462
Tom's brothers share
one pay-as-you-go cell phone,

36:36.495 --> 36:39.931
so the communication
to book these boys a ticket

36:39.965 --> 36:41.667
was extremely difficult.

36:41.700 --> 36:44.403
As soon as Tom's brothers
get in, I'll be less stressed.

36:51.843 --> 36:55.714
- Kristen texted me and asked
if there was anything, like,

36:55.747 --> 36:57.649
specific you wanted
at the house,

36:57.683 --> 36:58.984
like food- or drink-wise.

36:59.017 --> 37:01.553
- Dude, I have zero urges
to drink and party.

37:01.587 --> 37:03.722
- I still would like to be there
and be included.

37:03.755 --> 37:05.591
- I'm just kind of
over everybody, so...

37:05.624 --> 37:06.758
- [sighs]

37:07.893 --> 37:08.660
One of the things
I'm looking forward to

37:09.628 --> 37:11.597
at this wedding
is spending time with Shay.

37:11.630 --> 37:13.599
Are you gonna go tubing
with us?

37:13.632 --> 37:14.466
- I don't know.

37:14.500 --> 37:16.735
- I feel like I haven't
seen him a lot

37:16.768 --> 37:19.438
in the last six months,
and one of the best things

37:19.471 --> 37:21.473
about the Twenty Mile House is,
there's no studio.

37:21.507 --> 37:23.875
I was thinking about
maybe wearing this

37:23.909 --> 37:25.477
to the rehearsal dinner,

37:25.511 --> 37:27.879
but then everyone's telling me
it's too fancy.

37:27.913 --> 37:30.549
- What is that?
- It's a pantsuit.

37:30.582 --> 37:33.719
- Pantsuit?
- Yeah, can't you see?

37:33.752 --> 37:35.020
- I don't know.

37:35.053 --> 37:36.488
Dude, I do your laundry,

37:36.522 --> 37:38.023
and half the things
I try and fold,

37:38.056 --> 37:39.758
I don't even know
what they are.

37:44.763 --> 37:47.766
[light upbeat music]

37:47.799 --> 37:54.773
*

38:01.913 --> 38:05.717
- Here we are.

38:05.751 --> 38:07.018
- All righty.

38:07.052 --> 38:08.920
It's quaint, isn't it?

38:08.954 --> 38:10.889
It's, like, really rustic.

38:10.922 --> 38:14.660
It's kind of woodsy elegant;
that's for sure.

38:14.693 --> 38:16.061
It's cute.
Come on.

38:16.094 --> 38:17.596
- Hello.
- Hello.

38:17.629 --> 38:18.797
- How are you?

38:18.830 --> 38:20.699
- I'm Lisa Vanderpump.
- Yes, checking in.

38:20.732 --> 38:23.068
So we have you staying
in one of our Terrace Suites,

38:23.101 --> 38:25.771
which is just right next door
in our Terrace Suite building.

38:25.804 --> 38:27.906
All of the resort amenities
are right on the back--

38:27.939 --> 38:29.040
- But where's
the nearest Chanel's?

38:29.074 --> 38:30.609
- Well, probably
San Francisco,

38:30.642 --> 38:31.843
so, you know,
a five-hour drive.

38:31.877 --> 38:32.811
- Okay.

38:32.844 --> 38:34.846
- But we have some hiking
that you can do

38:34.880 --> 38:36.014
directly from the property.

38:37.182 --> 38:38.684
- The last time I did a hike,
it was around Neiman Marcus.

38:38.717 --> 38:39.818
- Right. [laughs]

38:39.851 --> 38:41.887
- But thank you anyway, Alex.
- You're very welcome.

38:41.920 --> 38:43.021
- This is absolutely lovely.

38:43.054 --> 38:44.490
I mean, it's totally different

38:44.523 --> 38:46.825
to many of the hotels
I've stayed in.

38:46.858 --> 38:48.927
- We have two rooms.
This is the master bedroom.

38:48.960 --> 38:49.928
- This is the room?

38:50.796 --> 38:51.763
- Yeah, this is
the royal suite room.

38:52.464 --> 38:53.565
- We're in the most expensive?

38:53.599 --> 38:54.700
- But I see her vision,

38:54.733 --> 38:57.503
and even if you're
in a bloody tree house,

38:57.536 --> 38:59.871
you shut the f--- up
and you get on with it.

38:59.905 --> 39:01.507
It's the bride's day.

39:01.540 --> 39:03.108
Okay. Oh!
- Nice.

39:03.141 --> 39:04.776
Come on, pup.

39:04.810 --> 39:06.678
I'll put your bag here
for a moment.

39:06.712 --> 39:08.980
- Okay. Tell me
this isn't the bedroom

39:09.014 --> 39:10.882
with a pull-out bed.

39:10.916 --> 39:11.917
- There's obviously
an upstairs.

39:11.950 --> 39:13.719
I'm gonna take this up for you.

39:13.752 --> 39:15.921
- Oh, it's huge!

39:15.954 --> 39:17.889
Come on.
Up.

39:20.025 --> 39:21.693
Go to sleep.

39:21.727 --> 39:24.029
Hey, look, pink flowers
everywhere. That's sweet.

39:24.062 --> 39:25.897
Oh, my God.

39:25.931 --> 39:27.866
Can't believe
we're actually here

39:27.899 --> 39:28.934
and it's actually happening.

39:28.967 --> 39:31.870
And I'm bloody ordaining it.
How did this happen?

39:31.903 --> 39:33.805
- He hasn't married her yet.
- Oh, shut up.

39:33.839 --> 39:35.841
Of course he's going to.
- Hopefully.

39:35.874 --> 39:37.743
But I've seen him
chicken out before.

39:37.776 --> 39:39.077
You know, the LVP Sangria.

39:39.110 --> 39:40.612
- Pandy told me

39:40.646 --> 39:42.147
this is the second time
you've wimped out

39:42.180 --> 39:45.150
just like a big, bloody
wussy pussy.

39:45.183 --> 39:46.585
- [sighs]

39:46.618 --> 39:47.986
- Oh, Ken.

39:48.019 --> 39:49.955
- And bartending in Pump.

39:49.988 --> 39:51.923
- Your buddy Tom Schwartz
had a panic attack.

39:51.957 --> 39:54.125
He walked right out
in the middle of the shift.

39:54.159 --> 39:55.761
- Are you serious?

39:55.794 --> 39:56.828
- He ran out.

39:56.862 --> 39:58.163
He couldn't even finish
his shift.

39:58.196 --> 40:00.031
- He's not going to run out
of the wedding.

40:00.065 --> 40:01.767
Don't be ridiculous.
- He couldn't finish his shift.

40:01.800 --> 40:03.835
He was too nervous.
- That's a hell of a difference.

40:03.869 --> 40:05.871
Working behind a bar and
not knowing what you're doing.

40:05.904 --> 40:07.839
- It's probably more frightening
getting married

40:07.873 --> 40:09.775
than working behind the bar
at Pump.

40:09.808 --> 40:13.044
- I hope Ken's joke doesn't
have any truth to it.

40:13.078 --> 40:14.746
Fingers crossed.

40:14.780 --> 40:17.015
All's gonna be perfect
tomorrow night.

40:17.048 --> 40:18.784
- What do you think?
- I don't know.

40:18.817 --> 40:20.185
But don't think
you're getting any action

40:20.218 --> 40:22.554
just 'cause we're
in a hotel room.

40:23.622 --> 40:25.190
- I got to call Sandoval.

40:25.223 --> 40:26.792
- Wait.
What's wrong?

40:34.700 --> 40:37.603
[upbeat music]

40:38.036 --> 40:39.838
*

40:39.871 --> 40:42.040
- [groans]

40:42.073 --> 40:43.809
- All right.

40:43.842 --> 40:44.843
*

40:44.876 --> 40:46.578
- Bridesmaids.
- Ooh ha ha!

40:46.612 --> 40:47.813
- All right.

40:47.846 --> 40:51.717
- Hey!
[people cheer]

40:51.750 --> 40:53.585
- What's up, dude?

40:53.619 --> 40:55.186
- I'm shedding a tear.
- Are you crying?

40:55.220 --> 40:56.622
- I'm shedding a tear!
- Are you crying, man?

40:57.756 --> 40:59.090
- Hey, I got to show you guys
where you're staying.

40:59.124 --> 41:01.493
- What's this?
Is this our room?

41:01.527 --> 41:02.628
We're in the parlor.

41:02.661 --> 41:04.129
- Hey, this is perfect
for you,

41:04.162 --> 41:05.597
'cause this is where
the gambling

41:05.631 --> 41:07.499
and the drinking took place
back in the day.

41:07.533 --> 41:08.500
- Yes!

41:09.434 --> 41:10.602
- Yeah, this is where
the saloon used to be.

41:10.636 --> 41:11.803
Drinking, gambling, sex.

41:11.837 --> 41:14.205
- Sex?
[laughter]

41:14.239 --> 41:15.574
- I just kind of fantasized

41:16.642 --> 41:17.643
about, you know,
being tied up to a bed.

41:18.644 --> 41:19.578
Maybe Brittany feeding me
a turkey sandwich.

41:20.579 --> 41:21.680
- Sandy not being here
feels really messed up.

41:22.648 --> 41:23.715
I don't like it.
- He'll be here really soon.

41:24.883 --> 41:25.751
- 'Cause we've been talking
about tubing for a month.

41:26.317 --> 41:28.086
- He made it to the gate

41:28.119 --> 41:31.557
as they shut the door
of the plane in front of him.

41:31.590 --> 41:33.158
I'm taking a picture
of the window,

41:33.191 --> 41:34.893
and he's taking a picture
of the plane,

41:34.926 --> 41:35.961
watching us fly away.

41:35.994 --> 41:38.764
- I got to call Sandoval.
- Wait. What's wrong?

41:38.797 --> 41:41.166
- His f---ing brothers
missed their flight.

41:41.199 --> 41:42.901
One flight, one day
for your brother's wedding,

41:42.934 --> 41:44.903
and you f--- it up,
you can't make it?

41:44.936 --> 41:46.638
Like, I don't get it.

41:46.672 --> 41:48.306
This is why
they're f---ing idiots.

41:48.339 --> 41:49.675
F---ing idiots.

41:50.809 --> 41:51.543
Are you f---ing kidding?
Their f---ing brother's wedding?

41:52.343 --> 41:53.078
What the f---
is wrong with you?

41:53.745 --> 41:54.112
- Shh, Tom doesn't know.

41:54.946 --> 41:55.681
- I know.
I got to call Sandoval.

41:56.314 --> 41:57.649
I have to call Tom.

42:00.118 --> 42:02.220
- Next time
on "Vanderpump Rules"...

42:02.253 --> 42:03.855
- Ooh!
This is awesome!

42:03.889 --> 42:06.324
- This is best group activity
we've ever done.

42:06.357 --> 42:08.560
- Oh, rock up the butt.

42:08.594 --> 42:09.928
- Yeah!

42:09.961 --> 42:12.330
- This mother----er's
getting married tomorrow.

42:12.363 --> 42:13.599
[people cheer]

42:13.632 --> 42:14.700
- Love you, baby.

42:15.667 --> 42:16.668
- We wanted to give you
your wedding present

42:16.702 --> 42:17.703
a little early.

42:17.736 --> 42:19.270
- What the f---?

42:19.304 --> 42:20.271
[upbeat music]

42:20.305 --> 42:21.272
- You need anything else?

42:21.306 --> 42:23.709
- I do need to finish my vows.
[laughs] Oops.

42:23.742 --> 42:25.611
- If you're gonna back out,
do it now.

42:25.644 --> 42:26.712
There's a train out there.

42:27.713 --> 42:28.747
You can take off
and start a new life together.

42:29.748 --> 42:30.749
- So this is the part
that can't be broken.

42:30.782 --> 42:31.817
- Okay.
- Sh--.

42:32.751 --> 42:33.719
- If that seam f---s up,
then we're f---ed,

42:34.552 --> 42:35.120
'cause then the dress
rips apart.

42:35.887 --> 42:36.755
- Maybe tacos and margaritas

42:37.923 --> 42:38.790
the night before
you're supposed to slip into

42:39.557 --> 42:40.826
a form-fitting wedding dress

42:40.859 --> 42:42.661
is not the best idea.

42:42.694 --> 42:45.664
[melodic music]

42:45.697 --> 42:49.701
*

42:49.735 --> 42:51.737
- You guys?

42:51.770 --> 42:54.239
[all gasping, cheering]

42:54.272 --> 42:56.742
- To see more of
"Vanderpump Rules," go to...
