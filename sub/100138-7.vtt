I have urgent information
about your husband.

22:03.160 --> 22:05.720
And I can't say it to you on your porch.

22:05.840 --> 22:07.274
Where's your lounge?

22:34.400 --> 22:35.834
What a pleasant room.

22:38.400 --> 22:39.674
It's strange.

22:39.800 --> 22:44.237
Some houses you walk into
and you know they're not happy places.

22:46.960 --> 22:52.114
Other houses, it could be a smell
or something indescribable,

22:52.240 --> 22:56.074
but you know a happy family lives inside.

22:56.200 --> 22:57.759
You know nothing about this family.

22:59.240 --> 23:00.594
I know you have a son.

23:02.240 --> 23:03.355
<i>Will.</i>

23:04.960 --> 23:06.234
Stay away from him.

23:06.360 --> 23:08.033
I've no intention
of going anywhere near him.

23:10.160 --> 23:11.639
I'm on your side, Elaine.

23:22.520 --> 23:23.840
Who do you work for?

23:25.120 --> 23:28.476
When I left the Marines, I was offered
the opportunity to do some...

23:28.600 --> 23:30.079
...some intelligence work.

23:31.640 --> 23:33.233
So, MI5, MI6?

23:33.360 --> 23:35.590
Maybe we don't need
to answer that question.

23:47.640 --> 23:50.154
- Tell me what you know about John.
- We're concerned.

23:50.280 --> 23:54.513
We believe that before he disappeared

23:54.640 --> 23:57.473
he was entangled in something nasty.

23:57.600 --> 23:58.920
I'm sorry?

23:59.040 --> 24:01.714
We're investigating the disappearance
13 years ago

24:01.840 --> 24:03.877
of some rather valuable objects.

24:04.000 --> 24:05.434
Dangerous objects.

24:05.560 --> 24:08.837
And your husband's name
keeps getting brought up.

24:10.400 --> 24:12.437
What objects?

24:12.560 --> 24:16.793
What if I told you there was
a possibility, albeit slight,

24:16.920 --> 24:19.480
that we might,
with the right information,

24:19.600 --> 24:21.910
be able to find John himself?

24:23.120 --> 24:24.758
I have already buried my husband.

24:24.880 --> 24:26.598
I'm not talking about his corpse.

24:28.440 --> 24:32.718
And if our information is correct...

24:35.120 --> 24:36.793
...he could be alive.

24:40.240 --> 24:41.674
There is no chance of that.

24:42.880 --> 24:44.200
And I'm telling you...

24:45.360 --> 24:46.634
...there is.

24:54.000 --> 24:55.798
I can't help you. I know nothing.

24:57.160 --> 24:59.151
He wrote to you.

24:59.280 --> 25:00.714
He wrote every day.

25:02.240 --> 25:04.754
Those letters could have
vital clues in them.

25:06.240 --> 25:08.197
My husband left me with nothing.

25:08.320 --> 25:10.755
I have nothing for you.

25:10.880 --> 25:12.279
That's not true.

25:13.560 --> 25:14.994
He didn't leave you with nothing.

25:15.120 --> 25:19.273
You get money every month
from a bank account that he controls.

25:19.400 --> 25:20.595
I'm not helping you.

25:23.520 --> 25:26.273
I'm at liberty to search this place,
with or without your consent.

25:26.400 --> 25:27.834
Do you have a warrant?

25:27.960 --> 25:30.952
- I can get one.
- Well, we'll wait for that, then.

25:31.080 --> 25:34.152
Otherwise I will call the police
and they can sort this out.

25:34.280 --> 25:38.433
Are you aware that if you are obscuring
evidence from Her Majesty's Government...

25:38.560 --> 25:39.470
I've seen no evidence that you work

25:39.600 --> 25:41.830
- for Her Majesty's Government.
- ...that you're at risk of jail time...

25:41.960 --> 25:44.520
- Can I see some ID?
- ...and your son could end up in care.

25:51.640 --> 25:53.278
Do you know what you're risking here?

25:53.400 --> 25:55.198
I'm frightened of everything.

25:56.840 --> 25:59.150
Being frightened of you
is just one more thing.

26:09.840 --> 26:11.433

26:12.920 --> 26:14.240
There was nothing of the kind.

26:14.360 --> 26:15.873
I know what I saw.

26:18.200 --> 26:20.953
It's your mind playing tricks on you.

26:24.240 --> 26:25.674
Fine.

26:27.640 --> 26:28.789
I'll leave you be.

26:30.480 --> 26:32.312
But I will come back with...

26:33.960 --> 26:34.950
...AS you say...

26:36.000 --> 26:37.673
...the right paperwork.

26:41.360 --> 26:43.351
We can get him back for you.

26:47.680 --> 26:50.115

to cooperate with us.

- Tell me, child.
- I've done a terrible thing.

28:16.760 --> 28:19.559
I told Iofur to fight you in single
combat, and he's going to kill you.

28:19.680 --> 28:22.354
I tricked him
so he wouldn't just kill you at the gates.

28:22.480 --> 28:24.278
You tricked him?

28:24.400 --> 28:26.960
I thought I was doing the right thing.

28:27.080 --> 28:28.753
You were.

28:28.880 --> 28:30.518
I need to fight him,

- Yes. I remember your reassurances,

the freedom to experiment all he wished.

40:37.840 --> 40:40.480
That man... I knew he would...

40:40.600 --> 40:41.795
Come on.

40:43.160 --> 40:45.310
Mum, we're going now.

40:45.440 --> 40:46.919
- I was right.
- Not now, Mum. Come on.

40:47.040 --> 40:48.713
They have been watching us.
They want the letters.

40:48.840 --> 40:50.194
Come on, Mum.

40:51.400 --> 40:54.074
Will, stop. You have to believe me!

40:54.200 --> 40:55.713
I need you to believe me.

40:55.840 --> 40:57.911
I know my head isn't right,
but you have to believe me.

40:58.040 --> 40:59.997
I believe those letters are important.

41:00.120 --> 41:02.680
I believe there was a man with a snake.

41:02.800 --> 41:04.313
I believe you, OK?

41:05.720 --> 41:06.869
OK.

41:07.000 --> 41:08.718
OK. Come on.

41:20.920 --> 41:22.194
Will?

41:23.320 --> 41:25.391
My mum needs to come in for a bit.

41:25.520 --> 41:29.229
There's been a break-in at home.
She just needs a place to stay.

41:29.360 --> 41:31.795
- Come in. Let's call the police.
- You can't.

41:33.280 --> 41:34.873
They can't see her like this.

41:36.440 --> 41:38.431
And if they do, they'll take me into care.

41:38.560 --> 41:39.880
Then what are you going to do?

41:40.000 --> 41:43.550
Maybe I just need to go home, tidy up,
then I can bring her back.

41:43.680 --> 41:45.193
I just need to think.

41:45.320 --> 41:46.958
Please.

41:47.080 --> 41:49.037
And your door was always open,
remember?

41:51.080 --> 41:53.037
And now I need it to be open.

41:54.400 --> 41:55.470
Come in, love.

41:55.600 --> 41:57.637
She-She might need to stay overnight.

42:01.120 --> 42:02.918
I've got some spare pyjamas.

42:04.320 --> 42:05.993
We'll be fine.

42:08.640 --> 42:09.789
Mum...

42:11.160 --> 42:13.595
Mr Hanway's a good man.

42:13.720 --> 42:15.233
He'll keep you safe here.

42:16.480 --> 42:18.437
He will keep you safe, OK?

42:24.280 --> 42:25.918
Find them, the letters.

42:26.040 --> 42:27.633
OK. OK, OK.

43:01.360 --> 43:03.192
I'm not sure I like that song any more.

43:03.320 --> 43:06.153
LEE: I have to sing when I'm nervous,
you know that.

43:07.440 --> 43:10.080
- Think she's bust?
- Of course not. We just need

43:10.200 --> 43:13.431
to get out of here
so someone can take a look at her.

43:13.560 --> 43:15.790
And how do you suppose we do that?

43:15.920 --> 43:17.877
She's our only means of travel!

43:18.000 --> 43:19.593
(WHOOSHING)

43:19.720 --> 43:21.631
Maybe 7 can be of assistance.

43:24.480 --> 43:25.515
When did you...?

43:25.640 --> 43:27.790
I didn't... I-I didn't expect...

43:27.920 --> 43:30.878
One of my sisters
managed to track your movements.

43:31.000 --> 43:33.560
You are important to us, Mr Scoresby.

43:35.160 --> 43:36.912
But I failed you.

43:37.040 --> 43:38.917
And her.

43:39.040 --> 43:40.678
I lost Lyra.

43:40.800 --> 43:42.950
You didn't fail me in the slightest.

43:43.080 --> 43:44.514
Or her.

43:44.640 --> 43:46.233
You fought for her.

43:46.360 --> 43:48.670
And now her fate is in another's hands.

43:49.800 --> 43:51.154
She's alive?

43:52.240 --> 43:53.913
And Roger? And Iorek?

43:54.040 --> 43:57.920
Kaisa brings word
that they all live and all thrive.

43:58.040 --> 44:01.556
Iorek, with Lyra's help,
has reclaimed his throne.

44:01.680 --> 44:03.079
Yes!

44:03.200 --> 44:04.759
She is...

44:04.880 --> 44:07.633
Well, isn't that something? Wow!

44:08.800 --> 44:10.711
SERAFINA: I believe this is yours.

44:12.800 --> 44:14.154
Where did you...?

44:15.520 --> 44:16.749
How did...?

44:17.960 --> 44:19.075
Oh.

44:20.320 --> 44:22.630
Oh, this means you need me to fight again,
doesn't it?

44:24.880 --> 44:28.430
The battles are just beginning.
The great war is coming soon.

44:28.560 --> 44:29.994
No-No more fancy talk.

44:30.120 --> 44:33.033
I'm just a hustler. I've played my part.

44:34.720 --> 44:38.031
I was useful for a piece,
but I'm no use to you now.

44:39.520 --> 44:40.919
You're wrong.

44:41.040 --> 44:43.475
And it's Lyra who will need you.

44:44.560 --> 44:46.551
So this is still about fate?

44:46.680 --> 44:48.034
Of course it is.

44:49.440 --> 44:50.919
She needs me?

44:52.200 --> 44:54.111
She needs all of us.

44:55.520 --> 44:57.158
Then I hope I'm strong enough.

46:24.440 --> 46:26.556
(THUDDING)

46:31.640 --> 46:34.314
There. Can you see?

46:35.920 --> 46:37.593
LYRA: That's where my father is?

46:39.080 --> 46:40.718
Why does he want to be here?

46:40.840 --> 46:43.309
That...you will have to ask your father.

I will stand down the bears
that are keeping your father prisoner.

50:49.320 --> 50:51.231
His guards are now my guards.

50:52.920 --> 50:54.149
Be safe.

50:55.640 --> 50:56.960
Both of you.

51:04.640 --> 51:07.996
You all right, Lyra?
Last time we saw him, he was your uncle.

51:11.760 --> 51:14.718
We're just giving him his alethiometer.

51:14.840 --> 51:17.275
And then maybe we can...go home.

51:19.760 --> 51:22.400
- This for me or for you?
- Bit of both.

51:30.360 --> 51:32.431
I know you're brave,

51:32.560 --> 51:36.076
but hopefully you know
that if you are ever scared...

51:36.200 --> 51:37.190
...I'm here.

51:38.920 --> 51:40.513
I do.

51:40.640 --> 51:41.994
I do know that.

52:06.320 --> 52:07.594
Little Lyra!

52:07.720 --> 52:10.872
Come in, come in.
What are you doing here?

52:13.520 --> 52:15.989
You must be chilled.
I'll get the fire lit.

52:29.320 --> 52:30.469
No!

52:33.720 --> 52:35.119
(SHOUTS) No!

52:38.320 --> 52:40.516
I did not send for you!

52:40.640 --> 52:42.472
I did not send for you/

52:43.640 --> 52:45.995
You have to leave.
You have to turn around and leave!

52:46.120 --> 52:47.918
I did not send for you!

52:52.360 --> 52:54.590
- I came here to free you.
- No.

No, you have to get out before...

...make them some food.
