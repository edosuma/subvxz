- Jesus, Paige.
- Mm-hmm.

39:35.306 --> 39:37.008
I mean, I apologized.
He apologized.

39:37.041 --> 39:40.378
But nothing kills the mood
more than a trip to the ER.

39:40.411 --> 39:42.180
Mm-hmm. You should have
broke his neck for him.

39:42.180 --> 39:43.581
Mm, I wish I could.

39:43.581 --> 39:45.049
(Charlie)
House meeting!

39:45.049 --> 39:46.517
Let's go!

39:46.551 --> 39:48.186
- Yo!
- House meeting!

39:48.186 --> 39:52.657
Whoa, whoa, what's going on?

39:52.690 --> 39:55.159
We just got back from Florida
with a haul of oxy.

39:55.193 --> 39:56.427
My inventory log
was crowded,

39:56.461 --> 40:00.064
so I decided to do inventory--
20 missing.

40:00.064 --> 40:01.733
- 20 pills?
- Yeah.

40:01.733 --> 40:04.535
- How?
- No, the question is who?

40:04.569 --> 40:06.004
Yay, house meeting.

40:06.037 --> 40:07.272
Charlie's missing oxy, man.

40:07.305 --> 40:09.007
Someone in the house.

40:09.040 --> 40:13.111
Well, if oxy's missing,
I think we all know who took it.

40:17.215 --> 40:20.718
(Madison)
You really saved us
back there, didn't you?

40:20.752 --> 40:24.589
Gusti and me?

40:24.622 --> 40:28.059
I really needed that pill, Mike.

40:28.092 --> 40:29.460
I don't know how you knew,

40:29.494 --> 40:32.363
but thanks.

40:32.397 --> 40:34.565
Don't mention it.

40:34.599 --> 40:39.270
Let's just say
I know the feeling.

40:39.304 --> 40:41.272
You want some more?

40:41.306 --> 40:43.374
[sighs]
Do I want some more?

40:50.181 --> 40:52.016
What are you doing?

40:52.050 --> 40:53.451
[chuckles]

40:53.484 --> 40:58.256
Swallowing's fine,
but, um,

40:58.289 --> 41:00.758
smoking...

41:00.992 --> 41:02.093
Yeah.

41:02.126 --> 41:04.395
No, thanks.

41:04.395 --> 41:07.465
[inhales deeply]

41:08.633 --> 41:10.068
[exhales]

41:10.101 --> 41:14.372
This is what freedom
feels like.

41:14.372 --> 41:16.240
- Want some?
- No.

41:16.274 --> 41:18.309
I don't do that.

41:18.343 --> 41:21.112
I'm good.

41:21.145 --> 41:22.213
No, you're not.

42:06.391 --> 42:08.760
[dog barks]
