WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:04.001
(MUSIC)

00:17.959 --> 00:19.959
Once upon a time,

00:20.001 --> 00:22.001
there was a king and queen.

00:22.042 --> 00:24.977
Who have a very
beautiful baby girl.

00:25.001 --> 00:28.976
They ask all of the fairies
in the kingdom of olivet,

00:29.000 --> 00:32.976
to come and bestow
blessing upon the child.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.918
But, unfortunately,

00:35.959 --> 00:38.143
they forgot to
invite one of them.

00:38.167 --> 00:40.101
It's gonna look obviously
we can't come up with the

00:40.125 --> 00:42.083
name by the time you have
to make the announcement.

00:42.125 --> 00:43.852
Look...

00:43.876 --> 00:46.834
Uh, the kingdom will rise
and like the dawn for her.

00:47.125 --> 00:48.918
Perfect!

00:49.001 --> 00:51.000
Then that is what
she shall be named.

00:52.043 --> 00:53.083
Finally.

00:53.125 --> 00:55.125
An heir for my kingdom.

00:55.918 --> 00:59.059
To carry our wishes and our
dreams into the future.

00:59.083 --> 01:02.059
You make me so very very happy.

01:02.083 --> 01:04.918
As you have me, my love.

01:05.083 --> 01:08.042
I bet she will have your...
Courage.

01:08.083 --> 01:09.977
And your kindness.

01:10.001 --> 01:12.000
And she shall have your beauty.

01:12.042 --> 01:14.083
And stubbornness.

01:15.918 --> 01:18.959
This is a moment of great
celebration for olivet.

01:19.001 --> 01:21.959
Nothing could spoil this day.

01:31.042 --> 01:33.083
(TRUMPET SOUNDS)

01:35.918 --> 01:40.083
The old, ladies, and enchantresses
from the three kingdom.

01:41.001 --> 01:43.959
Them beautiful people of olivet.

01:44.001 --> 01:45.143
We have invited you here today,

01:45.167 --> 01:48.059
to celebrate the lineage
of this fair kingdom.

01:48.083 --> 01:50.042
Please, come!

01:50.083 --> 01:51.959
And welcome.

01:52.001 --> 01:53.959
Our first born and heir.

01:54.001 --> 01:56.876
Princess dawn.

02:05.083 --> 02:08.125
May you find true love evermore.

02:17.001 --> 02:20.000
Your heart always lead
you to the truth.

02:23.000 --> 02:26.125
May happiness and love
guide you all the way.

02:33.083 --> 02:35.001
What's this?

02:35.043 --> 02:37.059
A party I wasn't invited to.

02:37.083 --> 02:39.894
Queen Violet, king David.

02:39.918 --> 02:42.083
I am slated by your exception.

02:42.125 --> 02:45.059
Queen tambria, we
meant you no offense.

02:45.083 --> 02:48.083
We sent out until the last announce
of the birth of our child.

02:48.167 --> 02:50.018
I had nothing.

02:50.042 --> 02:52.978
Perhaps, due to the
inaccessibility of your abode.

02:53.002 --> 02:57.001
My abode is where you shove me
in the corner of your realm.

02:57.876 --> 03:00.000
Mind I remind you,
queen tambria,

03:00.042 --> 03:02.101
when your kingdom
was demolished,

03:02.125 --> 03:06.001
we harbored you, out of the
kindness of our hearts.

03:06.043 --> 03:10.000
I only am here to bestow
a gift upon the child.

03:18.001 --> 03:19.042
You may.

03:32.918 --> 03:35.918
Dear sweet beautiful child.

03:35.959 --> 03:37.976
My gift to you is this.

03:38.000 --> 03:43.042
By your sixteenth birthday, you will
receive a prick by a spinfal by a spindle.

03:43.083 --> 03:45.976
And impayment for
your parents offense.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.959
You should die.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.977
You evil putrid soul...

03:55.001 --> 03:58.042
A curse that has been
done, can not be erased.

03:58.083 --> 04:01.042
And so I cast a spell
upon her grace.

04:01.083 --> 04:03.059
Until a prince does
play his part,

04:03.083 --> 04:06.000
and come to help pure heart,

04:06.042 --> 04:09.001
she shall laying
protected sleep.

04:09.043 --> 04:12.001
Until true love's kiss
with passion deep.

04:12.043 --> 04:15.894
The kingdom too shall sleep
as well, until this kiss.

04:15.918 --> 04:17.083
To break the spell.

04:17.125 --> 04:19.101
You poor three little nymph.

04:19.125 --> 04:22.976
As everyone here slumbers, I
will take over the kingdom.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.018
And make it only mine.

04:25.042 --> 04:26.976
And as for you, tambria.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.894
Death and destruction will
be your only companion.

04:29.918 --> 04:32.018
That you should got
for become evil.

04:32.042 --> 04:36.001
And your power will be
subject to this one throw.

04:41.043 --> 04:42.043
Guards!

04:45.918 --> 04:47.001
Stop, tambria!

04:47.043 --> 04:49.001
We will not approving you.

04:49.959 --> 04:51.894
And I am sure with you.

04:51.918 --> 04:58.000
Don't you know that my power's so much
more glorious than all you shall see.

05:01.001 --> 05:02.083
You have killed my sister.

05:02.167 --> 05:04.894
Now you'll pay for
your betrayal.

05:04.918 --> 05:06.876
You remain in this
kingdom alone.

05:06.918 --> 05:09.001
For as long as the
spell is in place.

05:13.001 --> 05:14.125
(SCREAMING)

05:18.043 --> 05:20.894
I will no longer be slated.

05:20.918 --> 05:25.918
And you shall all rot in hell.

05:27.959 --> 05:33.042
The asylum presents
sleeping beauty

06:34.125 --> 06:38.876
to prevent the evil curse
from ever coming through,

06:38.918 --> 06:42.959
the king ordered all spindles
to be collected and burnt.

06:43.001 --> 06:48.001
Until not a single one left
in the kingdom of olivet.

06:50.083 --> 06:53.876
Please mama, can you make
me a cloth for winter?

06:53.918 --> 06:55.976
You know you mustn't
ask such things.

06:56.000 --> 07:01.042
The king also ordered a wall
to be built around the castle.

07:01.083 --> 07:06.018
And princess dawn to be locked
away for her own protection,

07:06.042 --> 07:07.918
in the Ivy tower.

07:07.959 --> 07:10.956
Until her sixteenth
birthday came to pass.

07:10.980 --> 07:14.001
15 years later

07:25.042 --> 07:27.083
(DOOR KNOCKED)

07:28.043 --> 07:29.043
Come in.

07:30.043 --> 07:31.918
Mother!

07:33.000 --> 07:35.834
My dear girl! You're
so excitable.

07:35.918 --> 07:37.000
I apologize.

07:37.042 --> 07:39.976
But, my sixteenth
years almost upon us.

07:40.000 --> 07:43.894
And, I can not wait to
get out from my chamber.

07:43.918 --> 07:46.059
- Will there be a large party tonight?
- Yes.

07:46.083 --> 07:48.018
And, will everyone in
the kingdom be there?

07:48.042 --> 07:50.001
Of course.

07:50.959 --> 07:54.000
Even the boy who
brings bread everyday?

07:54.918 --> 07:56.125
Tell me about him.

07:56.167 --> 07:59.876
I see him from my window
to the kitchen here today.

08:01.042 --> 08:02.959
Has he seen you?

08:03.083 --> 08:05.000
He's quite handsome.

08:05.083 --> 08:06.101
Is he, no?

08:06.125 --> 08:09.125
Perhaps, I an meet him someday.

08:11.001 --> 08:12.959
Perhaps you can.

08:13.001 --> 08:16.000
In the meantime you should
keep up your studies.

08:16.083 --> 08:18.125
You know I like wise princess.

08:18.167 --> 08:19.976
Of course, mother.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.083
Uh, so much to prepare.

08:21.125 --> 08:22.976
I can hardly contain myself.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.959
So excitable.

08:26.125 --> 08:28.001
Dawn...

08:28.959 --> 08:32.001
You are the most precious thing
to me in the whole world.

08:37.125 --> 08:41.000
I promise, tonight,
when the moon rises,

08:41.042 --> 08:44.001
and you have not been pricked.

08:44.959 --> 08:46.959
We all celebrate.

08:50.918 --> 08:52.001
(DOOR OPENS)

09:05.876 --> 09:09.000
They say that only true
love will break the spell.

09:09.042 --> 09:13.043
It's all I can only hope for the
curse never finds it place.

09:21.918 --> 09:24.125
To my prince this
dove shall fly.

09:57.167 --> 10:02.977
And when the moon finally rose
on dawn's sixteenth birthday

10:03.001 --> 10:09.125
breaking the curse. There was
celebrations through out the kingdom.

10:15.042 --> 10:21.918
(MUSIC PLAYING)

10:31.167 --> 10:34.083
Are you ready, my dear?
Your party awaits.

10:34.167 --> 10:36.918
- I'm a Little afraid.
- Oh...

10:36.959 --> 10:41.018
Don't be afraid, my love. They're
gonna love you, just as we love you.

10:41.042 --> 10:45.894
I just can't believe it, I waits
my whole life, now I finally free.

10:45.918 --> 10:47.876
Yes, you are.

10:47.918 --> 10:50.125
You'll never have to wait again.

10:50.167 --> 10:54.083
(TRUMPET)

11:23.918 --> 11:26.083
May I have this dance, princess?

11:27.918 --> 11:29.894
May I dance?

11:29.918 --> 11:31.918
Ask your mother.

11:32.042 --> 11:35.918
Of course, you have
our permission.

11:50.001 --> 11:51.976
You know that boy?

11:52.000 --> 11:55.059
No, my king. That is one
of the knights men.

11:55.083 --> 11:57.042
Perhaps.

11:57.918 --> 12:00.042
I have a present for you.

12:02.043 --> 12:04.000
You do?

12:06.918 --> 12:09.042
That is so very kind.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.059
Not here.

12:18.083 --> 12:20.083
Come.

12:28.000 --> 12:31.959
It's been so very long since
I've seen the sky above my head.

12:32.125 --> 12:35.000
- I just realize...
- What?

12:35.167 --> 12:38.894
I've never seen the
sky above my head.

12:38.918 --> 12:42.918
It's so very... very beautiful.

12:42.959 --> 12:45.042
That's not the only thing
that is beautiful.

12:45.083 --> 12:47.918
My present?

12:48.001 --> 12:52.083
Perhaps it's not fit for a
princess of your beauty.

12:53.001 --> 12:56.001
But I've worked it
for so very long.

12:59.959 --> 13:01.834
Go ahead.

13:01.876 --> 13:03.918
Open it.

13:12.001 --> 13:15.001
I have never seen
anything like it.

13:15.083 --> 13:18.876
How ever did you make
something so beautiful?

13:18.918 --> 13:20.976
Promise not to tell?

13:21.000 --> 13:22.083
Of course.

13:22.125 --> 13:26.000
How could you make me
such beautiful gift?

13:30.042 --> 13:32.918
I made it with this.

13:34.918 --> 13:36.935
What is it?

13:36.959 --> 13:39.042
It's a spindle.

13:39.083 --> 13:42.042
But of course you
can't touch it.

13:44.001 --> 13:46.042
Have you seen dawn?

13:46.083 --> 13:48.083
She's fine.

13:50.125 --> 13:53.059
It is pass the full moon,
the curse is no more.

13:53.083 --> 13:57.000
Humor me, please. One last time.

13:57.959 --> 14:01.042
For you, my love. Of course.

14:12.001 --> 14:14.959
I mean... you're not supposed
to touch the spindle.

14:15.001 --> 14:19.894
Why not? Now the curseis no more.
I'm passed my sixteenth birthday.

14:19.918 --> 14:21.918
Let me see!

14:23.083 --> 14:25.959
It's harmless.

14:29.001 --> 14:31.042
No...

14:39.876 --> 14:43.918
You stupid little girl.

14:44.083 --> 14:48.000
I mean, you're not supposed
to touch the spindle.

14:50.959 --> 14:53.059
The eager of youth.

14:53.083 --> 14:58.894
Don't you know that once a spell
is cast, they cannot be broken?

14:58.918 --> 15:03.918
Your impatience and impetuousness
has not served you.

15:03.959 --> 15:07.018
And as for your dear
mother and father, well...

15:07.042 --> 15:10.918
I hope they sleep tight tonight.

15:18.001 --> 15:22.083
Ohh... Oh, no. This
can't be happening.

15:26.959 --> 15:29.000
My dearest king and queen,

15:29.042 --> 15:32.000
your child is falls asleep.

15:32.042 --> 15:33.042
Get away from her.

15:33.083 --> 15:36.083
And soon so shall you'd be.

15:40.000 --> 15:44.918
The moon is full,
or so it seems.

15:45.125 --> 15:50.001
Only a few days till
dawn sixteenth.

15:58.083 --> 16:00.959
I'm sorry that I have to
come drop the inevitable,

16:01.001 --> 16:04.059
but I had to make sure
that I got my kingdom.

16:04.083 --> 16:08.918
And now I shall rule it for
many-many years to come.

16:24.043 --> 16:27.083
Blast that putrid little nymph!

16:28.918 --> 16:30.894
Ah!

16:30.918 --> 16:33.976
A thousand curses
to you faeries!

16:34.000 --> 16:37.959
The curse and the counter
spell, now in place.

16:38.001 --> 16:42.976
All of alfelter fell into
a deep, deep slumber.

16:43.000 --> 16:49.977
And the evil tambria was left
alone to rule a sleeping kingdom.

16:50.001 --> 16:55.918
"100 years later. " "In
the kingdom of lipscomb."

16:59.959 --> 17:03.083
My father won't leave me his
kingdom, unless I find a wife...

17:03.125 --> 17:05.917
And sire an heir.

17:13.001 --> 17:15.852
You, come here.

17:15.876 --> 17:19.876
- Prince Jason has displeased the king.
- Again.

17:19.917 --> 17:22.917
I didn't quite learn my
lesson this morning.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.001
Oops.

17:28.041 --> 17:32.000
Take the prince's
punishment you putrid dog!

17:32.167 --> 17:34.918
Again.

17:44.083 --> 17:46.042
(GRUNTS)

17:51.959 --> 17:53.959
Oh, stop.

17:55.918 --> 17:59.959
Don't whip him
like an old woman.

18:01.043 --> 18:02.918
Do it like this.

18:05.001 --> 18:07.918
He must learn his lesson.

18:12.001 --> 18:14.894
I'll take your punishment,
but not from you.

18:14.918 --> 18:18.977
Sire, the future king should not
deal on his own punishment.

18:19.001 --> 18:20.918
Fine.

18:22.042 --> 18:24.918
I'll let grunner do it instead.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.143
Whip him!

18:30.167 --> 18:32.959
As if you were me.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.018
Enough!

19:16.042 --> 19:17.959
Enough.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.043
Barrow, you may leave.

19:26.083 --> 19:28.083
And you Peter.

19:30.918 --> 19:32.977
Argh! Wine, I want wine.

19:33.001 --> 19:35.083
One of you, get me wine!

20:11.083 --> 20:13.876
If you read this,
please do know.

20:13.918 --> 20:17.959
Let the vanity we begin to grow.

20:18.001 --> 20:21.001
I needed the kiss to
put away the charm.

20:32.918 --> 20:33.918
(GOOSE SOUND)

20:37.000 --> 20:38.083
Barrow!

20:38.125 --> 20:39.083
You're up early.

20:39.125 --> 20:40.918
What's that you have there?

20:40.959 --> 20:42.977
I... I found this
notes in the nest.

20:43.001 --> 20:44.977
Look! I make a map.

20:45.001 --> 20:46.876
Oh, geez.

20:47.000 --> 20:47.977
Who do you think wrote it?

20:48.001 --> 20:49.083
There can only be one.

20:49.125 --> 20:52.059
This can only be the word
of the sleeping beauty.

20:52.083 --> 20:53.125
Who is that?

20:53.167 --> 20:55.959
When princess dawn of
olivette was born...

20:56.001 --> 20:59.101
An evil witch put
a curse upon her.

20:59.125 --> 21:01.876
That by her 16th year...

21:01.918 --> 21:03.959
She would prick her
finger and die.

21:04.001 --> 21:07.083
Good fairies cast a
spell of their own.

21:07.167 --> 21:12.059
So that instead of dying, she
fell into a deep slumber.

21:12.083 --> 21:13.976
And no one can wake her?

21:14.000 --> 21:15.918
The legend has it that.

21:15.959 --> 21:19.101
The people of the kingdom
into the same deep slumber.

21:19.125 --> 21:22.042
No one has gone into that
kingdom and returned...

21:22.083 --> 21:25.959
This place of great evil.

21:26.001 --> 21:27.918
And so the legend tells.

21:27.959 --> 21:29.042
Where is this kingdom?

21:29.083 --> 21:31.042
It's not far from here.

21:31.083 --> 21:33.918
Just beyond those mountains.

21:33.959 --> 21:35.080
All the people of lundscape.

21:35.083 --> 21:36.976
Know this legend.

21:37.000 --> 21:41.001
People say that magic and
spells are just for children.

21:42.125 --> 21:44.918
This seem so very
sad more than this.

21:45.001 --> 21:46.083
Barrow.

21:46.959 --> 21:50.001
The prince requires
your services.

21:51.042 --> 21:52.976
What is this?

21:53.000 --> 21:55.043
It's nothing, just...

21:56.001 --> 21:57.042
A map.

21:57.083 --> 22:00.834
- Or some story.
- It's just something to fill the time.

22:00.918 --> 22:02.876
You don't have enough to do?

22:02.918 --> 22:04.918
This seem so taken up
much of your time.

22:04.959 --> 22:06.083
It's a writing.

22:06.125 --> 22:07.083
What does it mean?

22:07.125 --> 22:11.042
It's for little amusing and
idle mind, pay no attention.

22:11.083 --> 22:14.125
I'll let you know what I pay attention
and what I don't pay attention to.

22:14.167 --> 22:16.918
I leave you alone for 2 seconds.

22:16.959 --> 22:21.125
And you come running down
to the yard like boys.

22:22.125 --> 22:23.125
What's this?

22:23.167 --> 22:26.125
It is just something
I've discovered.

22:27.001 --> 22:28.918
Something you've discovered.

22:28.959 --> 22:30.083
Peter.

22:30.918 --> 22:32.083
What's it say?

22:33.959 --> 22:38.101
My sleep will end when a prince
bestow upon my lips with kiss.

22:38.125 --> 22:44.083
And the curse will end, and my kingdom
will through that prince shift.

22:44.125 --> 22:46.042
Hmm... What does it mean?

22:46.083 --> 22:49.000
It means my lord, that
the sleeping beauty.

22:49.042 --> 22:52.918
Princess dawn will wake
and the kingdom will pass

22:52.959 --> 22:55.200
to the prince who has bestow
upon her the true love kiss.

22:56.918 --> 22:57.976
A kingdom?

22:58.000 --> 22:59.976
Of my very own.

23:00.000 --> 23:00.976
Go away!

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
It's not so easy my
lord, there is evil.

23:03.042 --> 23:05.876
Those who go to that
kingdom, they not returned.

23:05.918 --> 23:08.042
The dark queen live
in the castle walls.

23:08.083 --> 23:13.976
Demons, dark forces that protect that
sleeping princess and the castle treasure

23:14.000 --> 23:15.876
you speak to me...

23:15.918 --> 23:17.894
About kingdoms and treasure.

23:17.918 --> 23:24.876
And expect me, a prince to care about
an old lady and her unseen forces.

23:24.918 --> 23:27.042
Do you think we can
take this kingdom?

23:27.083 --> 23:30.959
Oh, I could be king
of my very own.

23:31.001 --> 23:33.125
Anything is possible, my lord.

23:33.167 --> 23:35.876
- Gruner.
- My lord.

23:35.918 --> 23:36.935
Fetch the horses.

23:36.959 --> 23:39.001
We're off to get me a kingdom.

23:39.125 --> 23:41.043
Yes, my lord.

23:44.042 --> 23:47.894
Oh, I forgot. You're coming too.

23:47.918 --> 23:49.894
My lord, he's just
your whiping boy.

23:49.918 --> 23:51.078
What help could he be to you?

23:51.083 --> 23:53.083
Do you dare to question me?

23:53.852 --> 23:54.852
No, my lord.

23:54.876 --> 23:55.918
Good.

23:58.001 --> 23:59.959
You coming too.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.083
Err, which way is the kingdom?

24:23.125 --> 24:27.918
Err, I don't know my liege,
I look at my map first.

24:30.959 --> 24:35.918
It says here the evil queen built a wall
around the castle to keep people out.

24:36.001 --> 24:37.852
Again with the evil queen.

24:37.876 --> 24:40.083
A wall is of no concern,
we'll just climb over it.

24:40.125 --> 24:41.918
You can climb, aren't you?

24:41.959 --> 24:43.040
Let's take over the castle.

24:43.042 --> 24:45.876
If the legend is true, then
no one will be sleeping.

24:45.918 --> 24:48.000
It makes perfect sense
to me, brother.

24:48.918 --> 24:51.918
It says here that if we go near the
castle, we're in great danger.

24:51.959 --> 24:54.001
Yet to the river, boy.

25:19.125 --> 25:21.059
How we supposed to
get across there?

25:21.083 --> 25:22.959
What is the map say?

25:23.001 --> 25:24.959
It didn't say anything.

25:27.083 --> 25:28.959
Look!

25:29.001 --> 25:30.083
A boat.

25:30.125 --> 25:32.083
Oh, that's strange.

25:32.167 --> 25:34.083
Get on with it.

25:45.000 --> 25:46.959
It so far too easy.

25:47.001 --> 25:48.001
Come on, gruner!

25:48.002 --> 25:50.918
Don't be such a numby pumby.

25:53.043 --> 25:55.125
What's the matter grunner? You're
afraid to get your feet wet?

25:55.167 --> 25:57.001
I think he scare
of the boat too.

25:57.043 --> 25:58.101
I think he's afraid
of the water.

25:58.125 --> 26:01.959
Judging by the smell of them all,
they all afraid of the water.

26:02.001 --> 26:04.894
Come on! Let's move!

26:04.918 --> 26:06.918
- Come on, old man.
- Thanks.

26:19.083 --> 26:20.083
(BIRD SOUND)

26:27.083 --> 26:28.959
What was that?

26:29.001 --> 26:31.083
Oh, we'll gonna go in now.

26:37.918 --> 26:39.959
- Do you feel that?
- I did.

26:40.083 --> 26:42.918
I just hope that
we found a ground.

26:44.001 --> 26:45.959
Keep row faster.

26:47.001 --> 26:48.918
Whoa, there it is.

26:48.959 --> 26:51.083
No, that just the fish.

26:54.083 --> 26:55.083
(SCREAMING)

27:00.043 --> 27:03.959
(SCREAMING)

27:05.083 --> 27:06.894
Do it now!

27:06.918 --> 27:08.101
Help! Help me!

27:08.125 --> 27:09.918
Keep on guard!

27:10.918 --> 27:11.918
Help me!

27:13.167 --> 27:14.977
Help, someone help!

27:15.001 --> 27:16.001
Make way, make way!

27:17.918 --> 27:19.918
Run!

27:23.042 --> 27:24.876
Quick, quick, quick!

27:26.876 --> 27:28.125
Move! Get off the boat!

27:30.083 --> 27:31.959
Come on, man, get out, go.

27:34.125 --> 27:35.876
Run!

27:58.959 --> 28:00.001
I told you...

28:00.125 --> 28:02.001
It wasn't safe.

28:03.959 --> 28:05.083
There's no turning back now.

28:08.083 --> 28:10.043
You see what happened
to frederich?

28:12.083 --> 28:13.918
Did you see it?

28:16.000 --> 28:18.059
- You did this!
- Shut up!

28:18.083 --> 28:20.918
I told you, it wasn't safe!

28:21.001 --> 28:22.083
Should've listen to gruner.

28:23.001 --> 28:25.042
My lord, which way now?

28:27.001 --> 28:28.918
My lord!

28:32.001 --> 28:33.001
Barrow?

28:40.001 --> 28:41.001
Follow me.

28:41.918 --> 28:43.918
You don't lead, you follow.

28:49.042 --> 28:50.083
Follow me.

28:54.918 --> 28:55.959
We'll keep moving!

29:01.959 --> 29:03.042
What was that thing?

29:04.001 --> 29:05.959
You can't seriously
expect us to go on.

29:07.000 --> 29:08.876
Frederich's dead!

29:08.918 --> 29:11.083
I told you, it was
part of the curse.

29:14.167 --> 29:15.959
What do you say, gruner?

29:16.042 --> 29:18.043
How do you know of this curse?

29:20.959 --> 29:23.083
Why don't you say
anything sooner?

29:25.000 --> 29:26.894
My grandfather was a night.

29:26.918 --> 29:29.018
He tell my father the
story and he told me.

29:29.042 --> 29:32.876
That within the walls of that castle,
the dead walk of a living snake.

29:32.918 --> 29:36.000
The whole kingdom is
berserk with a curse.

29:40.000 --> 29:43.121
- Why did you not say anything sooner?
- I never thought to pay much attention!

29:45.043 --> 29:46.043
What does he mean?

29:47.001 --> 29:50.000
It means we are all walking
towards our own death.

30:04.959 --> 30:06.918
Alright men, let's
search for a way in.

30:07.959 --> 30:09.918
I wouldn't much want
a kingdom like this.

30:10.001 --> 30:11.001
Quiet!

30:11.002 --> 30:12.125
No one asked you.

30:14.167 --> 30:15.167
Ah!

30:16.001 --> 30:17.083
My lord...

30:18.043 --> 30:21.042
There's some kind of force.

30:21.918 --> 30:23.042
Surrounding the castle.

30:23.918 --> 30:25.042
We can't get in
any of the doors.

30:25.083 --> 30:26.083
Or windows.

30:26.084 --> 30:28.059
I've never seen
anything like this.

30:28.083 --> 30:29.125
No one has.

30:29.918 --> 30:31.918
This is tambria's magic.

30:32.000 --> 30:33.083
Another warning.

30:35.959 --> 30:37.119
We should rest here, my lord.

30:38.001 --> 30:39.042
Nonsense...

30:39.125 --> 30:42.001
We'll rest once I am
inside my castle.

30:42.959 --> 30:45.918
Look, there's something
there on the walls.

30:49.918 --> 30:50.918
What is that?

30:52.959 --> 30:54.918
Something unholy...

30:55.001 --> 31:00.918
From time to time, many sons of kings,
came and try to force their way through.

31:01.042 --> 31:02.125
But they were hold,

31:03.083 --> 31:07.042
in there they died a,
an lamentable death.

31:09.001 --> 31:10.894
Look, up there.

31:10.918 --> 31:11.918
An open window.

31:13.042 --> 31:14.083
Well, my lord?

31:14.959 --> 31:16.000
Are we going up?

31:17.000 --> 31:20.083
I think it would be wise
to let the men rest.

31:23.001 --> 31:24.959
We'll make a camp
over here, tonight.

31:25.001 --> 31:27.001
Very well, we'll keep watch.

31:29.043 --> 31:30.083
Before that...

31:31.001 --> 31:33.042
We should have barrow
tested it out for us.

31:34.125 --> 31:36.000
See if he can go up and down,

31:36.083 --> 31:38.000
without facing, what
was it you said?

31:39.876 --> 31:40.918
Oh, yes...

31:42.001 --> 31:43.876
A lamentable death.

31:44.083 --> 31:45.083
As you wish...

32:05.894 --> 32:06.894
(WINDOW BREAKS)

32:06.918 --> 32:08.043
Hey...

32:09.083 --> 32:11.000
This is a bad, bad place.

32:12.001 --> 32:13.042
Maybe we should go back.

32:13.918 --> 32:14.918
Go back?

32:15.042 --> 32:16.918
Through the lake?

32:19.000 --> 32:20.918
Then we camp.

32:21.918 --> 32:23.083
I want to stay here.

32:24.000 --> 32:25.876
There's been no way out.

32:25.918 --> 32:28.042
Look, hear me, brother.

32:28.959 --> 32:30.000
We'll be alright.

32:31.043 --> 32:32.918
The worst part is over.

32:34.083 --> 32:38.043
Inside that castle, we
will be rich, treasure.

32:39.125 --> 32:41.083
And once we're inside,

32:42.083 --> 32:44.001
it'll all be ours.

32:45.001 --> 32:46.918
Or we die.

32:51.001 --> 32:52.959
What of this lady of yours said?

32:53.001 --> 32:55.083
The wall is high,
you're sure to die.

32:55.125 --> 32:57.001
(LAUGHS)

32:59.001 --> 33:00.876
It doesn't look too bad.

33:01.876 --> 33:04.001
It'll just be like, climbing
the wall back home.

33:06.918 --> 33:08.000
(SIGHS)

33:21.000 --> 33:22.918
A little bit further, barrow.

33:31.918 --> 33:33.001
What can you see?

33:35.001 --> 33:36.894
This is an empty roof.

33:36.918 --> 33:38.125
Go inside...

33:41.043 --> 33:42.834
Secure the rope.

33:43.918 --> 33:45.876
We're all are going in tomorrow.

33:46.125 --> 33:48.083
No lamentable death today.

33:49.125 --> 33:50.959
Okay, heads up.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.918
(ROAR)

34:21.958 --> 34:22.958
Psst...

34:28.001 --> 34:29.161
What are you a girl or a boy?

34:30.001 --> 34:31.935
I don't know what
you think you are,

34:31.958 --> 34:33.083
but my name is Nick.

34:33.918 --> 34:36.918
Look, this men are
thieves and rapists.

34:37.001 --> 34:38.059
You shouldn't be here.

34:38.083 --> 34:40.000
And I could say
the same for you.

34:40.042 --> 34:44.043
This is no place for a heavy man,
who rather jink and lay down women.

34:44.083 --> 34:46.083
This is a dangerous place.

34:47.083 --> 34:49.001
So we've seen.

34:50.125 --> 34:51.918
What are you doing here?

34:52.001 --> 34:54.976
What are you a fugitive or
thief in your own mind?

34:55.000 --> 34:56.978
We saw the terrible thing
that happened to the king,

34:57.002 --> 35:00.918
starved, kicked, and
ends up with the dogs.

35:01.001 --> 35:02.083
So one day I left.

35:03.000 --> 35:04.160
And how did you get in there?

35:05.167 --> 35:08.125
I climbed for two days
and I can't get out.

35:09.001 --> 35:10.083
We took the lake.

35:10.167 --> 35:11.977
You don't understand,

35:12.001 --> 35:16.001
once inside the curse kingdom of
all us, the live don't leave.

35:16.876 --> 35:17.959
Yeah, listen...

35:18.001 --> 35:20.000
You're not safe here, you
should stick with us.

35:21.043 --> 35:24.001
Sleep on the ground, no thanks.

35:25.083 --> 35:28.001
(ROARING)

35:29.001 --> 35:30.918
(ROAR)

35:31.083 --> 35:32.083
What was that noise?

35:35.042 --> 35:37.000
It was the kingdom saying
we're not welcome.

35:40.918 --> 35:43.001
I'll have no such
insolence in my ranks.

35:43.918 --> 35:45.959
Now go and get the
men some food.

35:49.918 --> 35:53.125
And at first light, the prince wants
to see if there's another way in.

35:53.959 --> 35:55.001
A simple way.

35:56.083 --> 35:57.083
Move!

36:09.000 --> 36:10.876
Barrow.

36:12.918 --> 36:13.959
Yes.

36:15.001 --> 36:17.083
Treasure in this
castle must be great.

36:17.167 --> 36:18.959
All this in this castle.

36:19.001 --> 36:22.000
Well, she is of course very
beautiful as legend has it.

36:22.042 --> 36:24.042
Took my actual treasure.

36:24.083 --> 36:26.876
Hope princess...
Whatever her name is.

36:26.918 --> 36:29.001
Dawn, my liege

36:29.043 --> 36:31.001
your future princess'
name is, dawn.

36:31.042 --> 36:32.834
I know.

36:33.001 --> 36:34.918
Don't threatened me.

36:38.001 --> 36:39.918
What else do you know about her?

36:41.001 --> 36:42.018
She's one of a full writer.

36:42.042 --> 36:44.042
Has great in relationship.

36:44.167 --> 36:48.000
Many people say she's one of the
greatest mind in the three kingdom.

36:48.042 --> 36:50.001
Enough.

36:51.042 --> 36:52.894
What's that give
me a couple days.

36:52.918 --> 36:55.000
She won't have time
for such silliness.

36:55.918 --> 36:57.876
Of course my liege.

37:00.001 --> 37:01.042
Man!

37:01.918 --> 37:03.042
Wake up!

37:03.959 --> 37:06.001
Up, up!

37:06.918 --> 37:08.959
Let's secure the grounds.

37:09.918 --> 37:12.001
And the won't take my castle.

37:12.042 --> 37:14.918
We have visitors.

37:18.000 --> 37:21.001
Open the gate on their honor.

37:26.001 --> 37:31.042
Perhaps they would like to meet
some of the king's family.

37:55.083 --> 37:59.918
Kingdom is vast, my
liege well, barrow.

38:01.001 --> 38:02.125
How vast is my kingdom?

38:02.167 --> 38:04.042
I don't say like that, my lord.

38:06.959 --> 38:08.918
Well, it's bigger than
old school, right?

38:09.001 --> 38:10.083
I believe in that sir.

38:26.001 --> 38:28.000
What do you say
about this bridge?

38:28.042 --> 38:29.083
It's not on the map.

38:30.083 --> 38:31.976
It's not on the map.

38:32.000 --> 38:33.000
Could be a trap.

38:33.042 --> 38:37.042
I do not need your opinion of
what to do, when I am be a king.

38:37.918 --> 38:40.001
Okay, yes my majesty.

38:47.083 --> 38:48.918
My lord.

38:49.918 --> 38:51.959
They're wasting our time.

38:55.167 --> 38:57.001
Barrow.

38:57.042 --> 39:00.001
There's a thing I need
to explain to you.

39:05.918 --> 39:07.083
At first...

39:07.125 --> 39:10.876
You are indeed coming
all that you could be.

39:17.043 --> 39:19.042
There is more...

39:19.083 --> 39:20.083
What is that?

39:20.084 --> 39:21.959
The undead, my lord.

39:22.001 --> 39:22.918
They're coming...

39:22.959 --> 39:27.001
Run, go, go!

39:28.167 --> 39:30.001
Go!

39:33.876 --> 39:35.125
Go, go!

39:42.959 --> 39:44.876
Go, go, go!

39:47.043 --> 39:48.125
Earlin!

39:48.918 --> 39:51.001
Come on, get in.

39:52.000 --> 39:53.000
I'm not leaving...

39:53.042 --> 39:55.876
You have to go, you
have to go, come on!

39:55.918 --> 39:58.918
- I'll be fine.
- I'm not leaving you.

40:17.043 --> 40:18.918
To the wall.

40:21.167 --> 40:24.083
- You first.
- No, you first.

40:25.125 --> 40:26.918
I'll be first.

40:26.959 --> 40:28.894
Wilhelm, Jacob!

40:28.918 --> 40:29.978
Protect your future king.

40:30.002 --> 40:32.001
Fight, you coward!

40:39.918 --> 40:41.918
(GROANING)

40:47.001 --> 40:48.001
Go!

41:00.083 --> 41:02.083
- Let's go.
- We need to go back and save earlin.

41:02.125 --> 41:04.000
He's gone. Get up the wall.

41:04.083 --> 41:05.918
Go!

41:36.000 --> 41:37.959
Don't look down.

41:45.001 --> 41:46.918
What all those things?

41:47.001 --> 41:48.876
They're dead, my lord.

41:49.959 --> 41:51.918
It's the curse.

41:58.043 --> 42:00.000
This is all your fault.

42:02.001 --> 42:05.001
You show us the bridge,
you are the one to blame.

42:06.000 --> 42:07.083
So...

42:08.001 --> 42:11.918
What do we do now?

42:17.167 --> 42:19.918
Hope place's sealed.

42:20.001 --> 42:22.001
It's impenetrable.

42:24.042 --> 42:26.918
The upstairs is
completely blocked.

42:27.042 --> 42:29.834
The undead are down below.

42:30.042 --> 42:32.042
If we can't go up...

42:33.918 --> 42:36.001
We suffer the same faith.

42:38.083 --> 42:41.042
The only way out is
the way we came in.

42:43.125 --> 42:45.083
We need the distraction.

43:02.083 --> 43:03.918
(YELLS)

43:07.001 --> 43:08.001
Take me up!

43:08.002 --> 43:09.918
Pull me up!

43:10.083 --> 43:11.918
Wait.

43:16.918 --> 43:20.001
They've made it to the castle.

43:22.001 --> 43:25.042
Do you know this people, dawn?

43:36.042 --> 43:38.020
If you didn't done
this earlier, brother.

43:38.044 --> 43:39.959
You're telling me.

43:40.001 --> 43:41.001
My lord.

43:41.083 --> 43:43.043
What do we do up here?

43:48.083 --> 43:49.918
Leave him.

43:49.959 --> 43:52.083
Let him cover us
from the undead.

43:59.042 --> 44:01.876
Help, let me out!

44:02.083 --> 44:04.001
Psst...

44:05.001 --> 44:06.834
What are you doing here?

44:06.876 --> 44:08.116
Told not to come to the castle.

44:08.125 --> 44:10.000
Look, that doesn't matter.

44:10.042 --> 44:11.876
What do I do about
these things below?

44:11.918 --> 44:16.001
You use tunnels and past, but you
don't want to enter this castle.

44:16.043 --> 44:17.935
Where are they?

44:17.959 --> 44:19.918
Well above your head.

44:21.918 --> 44:23.018
Okay, thank you.

44:23.042 --> 44:26.000
You shouldn't thank me for
showing the way to your death.

44:27.918 --> 44:28.959
Where you going?

44:29.001 --> 44:30.083
You're not coming?

44:30.918 --> 44:32.042
I'm not allowing
myself to goes in.

44:32.083 --> 44:33.000
They're too malice...

44:33.042 --> 44:35.959
They're going to
slaughtered them.

44:36.001 --> 44:37.018
Listen, they're soldiers.

44:37.042 --> 44:38.918
I won't worry about them.

44:38.959 --> 44:42.001
You know that matters this
is queen tambria kingdom.

44:42.083 --> 44:43.083
You know that?

44:43.125 --> 44:44.918
I know a little.

44:44.959 --> 44:46.042
But she knows not of me.

44:46.083 --> 44:48.083
I am sure of that.

44:57.083 --> 44:59.876
We can't stay here.

44:59.918 --> 45:01.876
So, where we go?

45:02.918 --> 45:04.018
We don't have the map.

45:04.042 --> 45:05.083
It's with barrow.

45:11.042 --> 45:12.959
Gruner...

45:14.959 --> 45:16.959
Go and get him.

45:24.918 --> 45:27.043
- Let me help you up!
- I found the way in.

45:27.083 --> 45:29.125
Help the prince.

45:32.001 --> 45:33.083
What's happen?

45:33.167 --> 45:36.083
They invaded the castle
walls hasn't they?

45:37.042 --> 45:40.001
You know you're lucky
we rescue you barrow.

45:58.918 --> 46:00.000
Did you hear something?

46:00.042 --> 46:02.000
(GRUNT)

46:03.042 --> 46:05.083
Have a bad feeling
about this, brother.

46:07.918 --> 46:11.876
Man... Tightening up!

46:12.001 --> 46:13.001
Stay close!

46:13.918 --> 46:15.018
We're surrounded!

46:15.042 --> 46:16.083
It's the time!

46:38.042 --> 46:40.959
Hit them on the helmets!

47:10.001 --> 47:11.083
Good job, Matt!

47:17.001 --> 47:18.083
Is everyone alright?

47:26.042 --> 47:27.918
Good job.

47:32.083 --> 47:34.834
Move barrow!

47:37.001 --> 47:39.001
Time to plunder our treasure.

47:46.167 --> 47:50.918
And claim, my kingdom!

47:54.918 --> 47:59.083
Barrow, come... Join us.

48:10.083 --> 48:15.101
Well, is they think that they
can kill some of my pets?

48:15.125 --> 48:19.001
Then I'll have to use
something stronger.

48:22.001 --> 48:24.059
Try to carefully man.

48:24.083 --> 48:26.876
Be cautious...

48:29.042 --> 48:34.959
Let's claim it. So it seem like the
fact on the decoration of the death.

48:37.000 --> 48:39.894
Barrow, what'd you know of this?

48:39.918 --> 48:42.042
I'm suspected more undead.

48:44.959 --> 48:46.918
Gruner...

48:48.125 --> 48:50.042
Take this.

49:04.001 --> 49:05.125
It's true...

49:10.000 --> 49:12.876
All the stories are true.

49:17.918 --> 49:19.000
Let's go wimps...

49:19.042 --> 49:21.083
Friendship you a dance.

49:22.918 --> 49:25.876
You dance like a dog.

49:26.001 --> 49:30.894
Alright... Don't worry darling...
It's only hurt a moment...

49:30.918 --> 49:32.083
Stand down, brother!

49:34.001 --> 49:35.959
Well, I'm does it best.

49:36.001 --> 49:37.083
(HOWLING)

49:38.167 --> 49:40.000
- Leave her be!
- Watch your tongue!

49:40.042 --> 49:44.959
Enough! Once we killed the witch...
And I kissed the princess...

49:45.001 --> 49:48.000
You can have all the girls
you want, now move!

50:09.125 --> 50:11.976
My prince... It's
your treasure...

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
Mass spoiled are wait.

50:14.042 --> 50:15.876
It's a trap.

50:15.959 --> 50:17.978
How many time we getting
this treasure on God?

50:18.002 --> 50:23.000
But can't you see, this time are just
a monster, and her golds are being...

50:23.083 --> 50:24.959
A nuisance...

50:25.083 --> 50:27.125
Gruner!

50:32.001 --> 50:33.977
She is behind all the
evil, my league.

50:34.001 --> 50:36.918
I know...

50:36.959 --> 50:38.918
Let me go first...

50:39.083 --> 50:42.042
This is my kingdom...

50:54.125 --> 50:56.083
Barrow!

50:57.083 --> 51:00.001
Go fetch my treasure...

51:02.959 --> 51:04.959
Careful barrow...

51:28.959 --> 51:31.935
Hurry up, barrow, bring
me my treasure...

51:31.959 --> 51:35.083
Perhaps it's the best, if you
secure the castle first.

51:36.918 --> 51:38.078
Save the treasure, afterward.

51:38.083 --> 51:41.059
- We don't have time for this bullshit...
- He has the point, my lord.

51:41.083 --> 51:42.959
The treasure won't
way out us down.

51:43.001 --> 51:44.876
Why don't we secure the
castle and then...

51:44.918 --> 51:46.959
If I wanted you opinion...

51:50.918 --> 51:52.918
I'm asking you, right?

51:54.959 --> 51:55.977
The work, my league...

51:56.001 --> 51:59.000
I'll just fetch the
treasure myself.

51:59.959 --> 52:02.959
Come on! Help me!

52:15.001 --> 52:16.001
(GROWLS)

52:16.002 --> 52:17.918
What was that?

52:18.042 --> 52:20.000
- What?
- I felt something...

52:20.042 --> 52:22.000
What?

52:22.042 --> 52:24.000
(GROWLS)

52:25.083 --> 52:27.125
That was it again...

52:28.001 --> 52:30.001
Get to the stairs!

52:32.042 --> 52:34.959
Wait! The prince!
It's took the prince!

52:35.001 --> 52:36.101
Look, we have to go back!

52:36.125 --> 52:37.997
This was a trap!

52:38.021 --> 52:39.894
We'll be damn if we go
looking for him blindly!

52:39.918 --> 52:40.978
This is all your fault!

52:41.002 --> 52:41.978
You lead us here...

52:42.002 --> 52:43.918
You told us to come here...

52:43.959 --> 52:46.959
One good reason, why I
shouldn't kill you right now!

52:47.042 --> 52:48.918
Because I've got the map!

52:49.001 --> 52:49.978
And forgive me if I'm wrong!

52:50.002 --> 52:51.935
But I'm the only one
who can read it!

52:51.959 --> 52:54.000
Unless you can read!
And if you can't...

52:54.042 --> 52:55.978
Then maybe you should
go save the prince!

52:56.002 --> 52:58.876
And the princess!

52:59.000 --> 53:02.000
Man, ready your sword!

53:02.042 --> 53:04.935
We're going back in! Stay close!

53:04.959 --> 53:06.000
Barrow!

53:06.083 --> 53:08.876
You take the lead...

53:09.959 --> 53:12.001
Okay...

53:12.043 --> 53:13.918
Follow me...

53:24.083 --> 53:26.959
Okay... This is where
he went down...

53:27.001 --> 53:28.876
Anyone see anything?

53:30.918 --> 53:32.042
Clear...

53:32.083 --> 53:34.042
There is nothing over here...

53:37.000 --> 53:39.834
Oh... Okay...

53:39.918 --> 53:41.078
This tunnel, we search here...

53:41.083 --> 53:42.876
He must've go that way.

53:42.918 --> 53:46.043
- The prince is dead!
- Watch your tongue!

53:59.918 --> 54:01.977
(GROWL)

54:02.001 --> 54:04.042
That's it, we not
pulling back anymore.

54:05.059 --> 54:06.059
We're leaving.

54:06.083 --> 54:08.125
Would you want prince say, hah?

54:09.001 --> 54:10.125
This is good if she's dead.

54:10.918 --> 54:12.125
I thought you're soldiers.

54:13.001 --> 54:16.001
Not common farm hands
scare of legend of lord.

54:16.083 --> 54:18.043
Nothing is call me a legend.

54:18.959 --> 54:20.083
We must leave.

54:20.125 --> 54:22.042
You're frighten?

54:23.918 --> 54:24.918
No.

54:25.083 --> 54:27.083
The prince will be
angry if we leave.

54:27.918 --> 54:30.199
You wouldn't want to be a man
of craving now, would you?

54:34.042 --> 54:35.959
I'm with you.

54:36.042 --> 54:37.083
Good.

54:37.959 --> 54:39.042
Follow me.

54:42.125 --> 54:44.959
Don't think this way
is your position.

54:51.959 --> 54:53.918
That came from that direction.

54:56.083 --> 54:58.059
- One of the undead dead.
- Attack!

54:58.083 --> 55:00.918
- Move it!
- Wait! Wait!

55:01.001 --> 55:02.876
It's fine. It's
fine, I know her.

55:04.042 --> 55:05.918
And then what is
this, little twig?

55:06.083 --> 55:08.083
The lord of you are
deep in trouble now.

55:08.959 --> 55:10.000
This is newt.

55:10.167 --> 55:13.000
She's one of human other
things living on this always.

55:13.042 --> 55:16.083
That monster is condor of all
those evil with this chamber.

55:16.959 --> 55:18.125
And it here now.

55:18.167 --> 55:21.043
You haven't a change to
make out this castle alive.

55:21.918 --> 55:22.918
Unless...

55:22.919 --> 55:24.042
You leave now.

55:24.083 --> 55:25.834
Abandon your friends and prince.

55:25.959 --> 55:27.043
You know we can't do that.

55:27.083 --> 55:29.894
The prince is the only one
who can save the princess.

55:29.918 --> 55:31.020
Again with the prince,

55:31.044 --> 55:34.083
do you think that monster cares who
will eat and rip from limb to limb?

55:34.167 --> 55:36.918
He cares not. Save yourself.

55:38.918 --> 55:40.001
We can't.

55:40.918 --> 55:41.976
Then may the heaven be with you.

55:42.000 --> 55:45.001
Because you owe me to get
out this castle alive.

55:45.125 --> 55:47.918
(ROARING)

55:49.001 --> 55:50.876
Where did she go?

55:50.918 --> 55:53.042
(ROARING)

55:55.083 --> 55:59.083
Wait, my grand father told me
many tale a battle like this.

55:59.918 --> 56:01.876
Backward, stand first!

56:05.001 --> 56:06.918
Stand first!

56:33.000 --> 56:34.918
I'm alive, right?

56:35.083 --> 56:38.042
I'll be... I'll be fine.
I'll be fine.

56:38.083 --> 56:39.918
Jacob.

56:41.083 --> 56:43.976
(HUMMING)

56:44.000 --> 56:46.001
You know, I...

56:47.001 --> 56:49.001
Was respect on you so much.

56:53.125 --> 56:56.083
(SOBBING)

57:01.125 --> 57:03.043
(GRUNTS)

57:06.001 --> 57:08.001
You kill my brother.

57:08.042 --> 57:09.918
Let him go.

57:25.918 --> 57:27.042
Let's keep moving.

57:37.001 --> 57:40.876
You're sitting in
the king throne.

57:41.125 --> 57:47.894
And I've just lay
out a lovely feast.

57:47.918 --> 57:49.959
The prince will let come.

57:51.125 --> 57:53.977
I know your great grand father.

57:54.001 --> 57:56.001
I guess I'll remember him well.

57:57.001 --> 57:58.083
Brutal of a man.

57:59.876 --> 58:04.083
Not terrible affliction if there I
suppose that past down on your lineage

58:05.959 --> 58:10.001
he carry me away when my
kingdom was destroyed.

58:10.918 --> 58:12.959
Have you heard or
maybe you like?

58:13.043 --> 58:15.083
To have a kingdom destroyed.

58:15.959 --> 58:19.083
They slide my husband
throne over like a pig.

58:20.001 --> 58:22.059
And then they burn
my children alive.

58:22.083 --> 58:24.000
In font of me.

58:26.959 --> 58:33.001
I wonder what the carried king of lives
would think if I send his son had back.

58:33.959 --> 58:35.834
On the steak.

58:37.083 --> 58:40.043
I'm sorry if he slide at you.

58:50.042 --> 58:52.001
I'm sorry...

58:53.001 --> 58:55.001
If he slide at you.

58:56.083 --> 59:00.001
I'm not like my father.

59:01.042 --> 59:03.083
Or his father before him.

59:16.083 --> 59:18.083
I'm saw what happen back there.

59:18.918 --> 59:21.101
- There's no way we can survive this place.
- Look.

59:21.125 --> 59:23.918
The prince is the only one
who can break the curse.

59:24.042 --> 59:26.083
It's doubt for that
if he still alive.

59:26.918 --> 59:30.001
Listen, you'll be stay
here to be a coward?

59:30.125 --> 59:32.083
Or we can move
forward and fight.

59:32.959 --> 59:34.876
It's your call.

59:35.001 --> 59:37.083
I rather have my
brother's live back.

59:39.959 --> 59:41.125
I'm sorry for your lose.

59:41.959 --> 59:44.000
We can not allow your
brother death vainly.

59:45.042 --> 59:46.834
Come.

59:47.083 --> 59:48.918
Jacob.

59:50.042 --> 59:52.043
Continue to fight.

59:56.083 --> 59:58.042
(GROWL)

59:58.083 --> 59:59.894
Get him attack now.

59:59.918 --> 01:00:02.876
We fight well and destroy you.

01:00:05.042 --> 01:00:07.000
(GRUNTS)

01:00:09.918 --> 01:00:11.000
You're alright.

01:00:11.918 --> 01:00:15.001
I just saw in my live.

01:00:15.918 --> 01:00:17.876
The undead will
pass on that too.

01:00:17.918 --> 01:00:19.852
I don't wanna be inside
the castle anymore.

01:00:19.876 --> 01:00:22.000
Look, you can stay here,
but I'm going this way.

01:00:33.001 --> 01:00:34.918
Which way?

01:00:35.001 --> 01:00:36.918
I think is best if we split up.

01:00:37.083 --> 01:00:38.918
- I'll go with you.
- No.

01:00:39.083 --> 01:00:41.001
You stay with Jacob.

01:00:42.042 --> 01:00:43.959
Good luck.

01:01:10.001 --> 01:01:12.001
Bruno!

01:01:25.083 --> 01:01:27.083
Go to the hell!

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.083
(SCREAMING)

01:01:57.001 --> 01:01:58.042
He was right.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.834
I think we can't make
out of here alive.

01:02:02.918 --> 01:02:04.876
I was thinking the same thing.

01:02:09.918 --> 01:02:10.918
What happen?

01:02:10.919 --> 01:02:12.978
A curse down here
from beginning.

01:02:13.002 --> 01:02:15.001
That's what we do now.

01:02:17.125 --> 01:02:18.918
Thank you.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:24.001
I think nothing will lead is no
place to hoping that to know right.

01:02:24.042 --> 01:02:25.959
You've done well.

01:02:26.042 --> 01:02:29.935
That's might to fight and neither
we must make it out alive.

01:02:29.959 --> 01:02:31.018
We dead man if we stay here.

01:02:31.042 --> 01:02:33.042
We dead already.

01:02:33.167 --> 01:02:37.059
Just two of us against untold
number of monster and we're dead.

01:02:37.083 --> 01:02:38.918
If newt can do it,

01:02:39.001 --> 01:02:41.918
she can survive and so can we.

01:02:46.125 --> 01:02:49.039
It is indeed that you
and I and never refuse

01:02:49.063 --> 01:02:51.977
the challenge set main
rule, you have an idea?

01:02:52.001 --> 01:02:55.000
Actually, I did.

01:03:08.918 --> 01:03:12.083
Are these your men who
tortured my minions?

01:03:14.083 --> 01:03:15.959
I know nothing.

01:03:16.918 --> 01:03:19.043
I will take care of this.

01:03:22.918 --> 01:03:24.018
My leash.

01:03:24.042 --> 01:03:27.001
- We're here to save you.
- Barrow.

01:03:29.001 --> 01:03:33.083
Grulie, you're alive.

01:03:37.042 --> 01:03:39.894
Doesn稚 matter how
may you killed,

01:03:39.918 --> 01:03:42.918
there are other
thousand minions.

01:03:43.959 --> 01:03:48.001
I have infinite army that I
can call whenever I wish.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:55.894
For those who rise, and those
who lie, I ask you recent,

01:03:55.918 --> 01:03:59.918
all thee who have
died, rise up again,

01:04:00.001 --> 01:04:03.042
and walk with us.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:05.918
Thank you.

01:04:07.042 --> 01:04:09.101
You penetrate all the gate.

01:04:09.125 --> 01:04:11.959
You broke the gate,
unleashing my undead,

01:04:12.043 --> 01:04:14.001
into the three kingdoms.

01:04:14.043 --> 01:04:15.043
No.

01:04:15.918 --> 01:04:17.000
No?

01:04:17.918 --> 01:04:19.042
See for yourself!

01:04:27.042 --> 01:04:28.083
Oh...

01:04:29.001 --> 01:04:32.083
A family reunion of orcs...

01:04:40.083 --> 01:04:42.001
What is wrong with you?

01:04:43.001 --> 01:04:45.059
My ghouls will make sure,

01:04:45.083 --> 01:04:48.876
that each and every person
will bow down to me.

01:04:49.918 --> 01:04:51.001
Nowhere...

01:04:52.125 --> 01:04:54.083
And no one,

01:04:54.918 --> 01:04:56.918
will be safe.

01:04:59.918 --> 01:05:00.959
Dawn?

01:05:02.167 --> 01:05:06.083
Please, don't hurt her, just give
her to me, I'll take her far away,

01:05:06.125 --> 01:05:09.976
you can have your kingdom, just please...
Give her to me.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.918
Prince jayson, can you
hear your friend here,

01:05:12.959 --> 01:05:15.042
he wants the princess
all to himself.

01:05:15.083 --> 01:05:18.876
He never did know his
true position in life.

01:05:18.918 --> 01:05:20.083
What should we do with him?

01:05:21.001 --> 01:05:22.918
Leave him tied up.

01:05:24.083 --> 01:05:28.042
We'll deal with him once
we take care of dawn.

01:05:28.083 --> 01:05:31.000
- What happened to you?
- Watch your tongue, barrow.

01:05:31.918 --> 01:05:32.959
Especially,

01:05:33.083 --> 01:05:35.959
when you're talking
in front of...

01:05:36.001 --> 01:05:37.876
My queen.

01:05:46.001 --> 01:05:47.042
What about dawn?

01:05:47.959 --> 01:05:49.959
What about your quest
for the kingdom?

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.125
You'll never be a
prince, barrow.

01:05:52.167 --> 01:05:55.019
You are within boy,
that is all you are.

01:05:55.043 --> 01:05:59.000
And all you will ever be in
this kingdom, and the next.

01:05:59.083 --> 01:06:02.959
Why should I have one kingdom when
I can have three, with tambria.

01:06:03.042 --> 01:06:04.042
Besides,

01:06:04.125 --> 01:06:07.083
my father will never
give me his kingdom.

01:06:07.918 --> 01:06:10.000
So I decide to do things my way.

01:06:11.001 --> 01:06:12.042
This is my way.

01:06:13.083 --> 01:06:15.042
Can we get on with this, please?

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:17.083
And kill her.

01:06:25.042 --> 01:06:28.083
I need to see how deep
your loyalty lies.

01:06:28.918 --> 01:06:31.918
Which one of your friends
would you like to kill first?

01:06:32.083 --> 01:06:35.083
I would suggest you
kill within boy guy.

01:06:38.125 --> 01:06:41.083
What evil has
penetrate the prince?

01:06:42.001 --> 01:06:44.876
Believe me, I think it's
been always his nature.

01:06:44.918 --> 01:06:46.125
We'll never get out of here,

01:06:46.167 --> 01:06:49.000
especially on time to
safe the princess.

01:06:51.959 --> 01:06:54.935
Newt, ah, thank heaves.

01:06:54.959 --> 01:06:57.001
You shouldn稚 say that,
it still isn稚 finished.

01:06:57.043 --> 01:06:59.876
You can't assist the
princess is it? Yet.

01:06:59.918 --> 01:07:02.125
- You know where the princess?
- Of course, why not?

01:07:02.959 --> 01:07:04.915
Could you take us to her?

01:07:04.939 --> 01:07:06.918
To take you to her? Of
course, if you'd like.

01:07:15.876 --> 01:07:16.976
I think she's headed this way.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:18.083
What do you mean, you
don't know where she is?

01:07:18.167 --> 01:07:20.918
I've never been this way before.

01:07:24.001 --> 01:07:25.001
Run!

01:07:49.167 --> 01:07:51.125
Alright, you stay back.

01:08:04.083 --> 01:08:05.959
You betrayed me.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:08.894
I was just to save myself.

01:08:08.918 --> 01:08:10.042
Didn稚 seem like it.

01:08:10.083 --> 01:08:13.959
What was I supposed to do? Throw
myself on my soul as a sacrifice?

01:08:21.001 --> 01:08:23.001
Tambria was going to kill me.

01:08:23.042 --> 01:08:25.082
Isn稚 sound like a bad idea.

01:08:27.917 --> 01:08:30.977
Good men have died underneath your
honor, and now you switch her side?

01:08:31.001 --> 01:08:34.001
You are a coward.

01:08:55.001 --> 01:08:58.000
- You betrayed dawn.
- I was never gonna kill dawn.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:04.001
- How can I trust you?
- You have to.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:06.082
Barrow.

01:09:45.082 --> 01:09:46.959
I am sorry.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:51.042
There was no... Other way.

01:09:52.082 --> 01:09:54.125
She shall take us
to the princess.

01:09:56.083 --> 01:09:58.001
And kill tambria.

01:10:00.001 --> 01:10:01.083
I'll be your back up.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:04.083
No.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:07.959
You should go yourself.

01:10:11.083 --> 01:10:12.083
Here,

01:10:13.001 --> 01:10:15.083
take this, this is my crest.

01:10:17.876 --> 01:10:20.918
She goes somewhere where I
know she was looking, boy.

01:10:23.125 --> 01:10:26.043
When my father took
your father's kingdom,

01:10:27.001 --> 01:10:29.001
he took away your birth right.

01:10:33.918 --> 01:10:34.959
I'm giving it back.

01:10:42.167 --> 01:10:44.918
At least I can face
this like a man.

01:11:12.167 --> 01:11:14.000
You've returned.

01:11:17.001 --> 01:11:20.001
Perhaps you're more the
man than I thought.

01:11:21.001 --> 01:11:22.125
Perhaps I am.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.020
If I'm to spend an
eternity with someone,

01:11:25.044 --> 01:11:28.083
I need to know that
they can be by my side.

01:11:28.959 --> 01:11:31.834
You don't get anything
until you kill dawn.

01:11:31.918 --> 01:11:34.959
You see my armies are out there
conquering, and I can't enjoy it,

01:11:35.001 --> 01:11:37.959
because I'm stuck, in here.

01:11:39.918 --> 01:11:41.083
I need you to kill her.

01:11:50.876 --> 01:11:54.976
- Oh, she's...
- Beautiful? Is that what you're gonna say?

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.876
She's also about
to be very dead.

01:11:58.918 --> 01:12:00.083
Of course.

01:12:00.918 --> 01:12:02.959
- I just...
- Stop talking!

01:12:04.125 --> 01:12:06.001
(SWORD UNSHEATHING)

01:12:06.918 --> 01:12:08.125
I need you to kill her.

01:12:10.042 --> 01:12:11.876
Why me?

01:12:11.918 --> 01:12:14.394
I've tried to kill her
a thousand times, but

01:12:14.418 --> 01:12:16.918
every time I get close,
I get pulled back.

01:12:17.042 --> 01:12:20.083
It's part of the
little fairy's cast.

01:12:37.918 --> 01:12:40.000
Oh, look how sweet!

01:12:43.918 --> 01:12:46.977
You try to wake her with the
kiss, but don't you know

01:12:47.001 --> 01:12:50.083
that only a prince with the
pure heart can do that?

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:56.167
- Wake up!
- And it's obvious which one you are.

01:13:05.083 --> 01:13:12.918
Oh, it's so hot that you trying to
be a man, and you're so close...

01:13:16.959 --> 01:13:19.059
You'll never get away with this.

01:13:19.083 --> 01:13:23.042
How do you know that
if you're not alive?

01:13:24.959 --> 01:13:28.959
Bring me the bald one, I
want to play with his head.

01:13:39.083 --> 01:13:40.876
Psst!

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.935
Violet, you're still alive.

01:13:43.959 --> 01:13:46.918
Of course, I am here to
lead you to the princess

01:13:48.001 --> 01:13:49.001
let's go.

01:14:02.918 --> 01:14:06.894
If you kill the princess, you'll have
your own kingdom, not a very big

01:14:06.918 --> 01:14:10.918
kingdom, but a kingdom nonetheless
and I'll obey eternally people.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:14.101
What would you want me to do?

01:14:14.125 --> 01:14:18.977
To stab her through her heart, I
don't want to take any chances.

01:14:19.001 --> 01:14:22.043
And you'll have whatever
your heart desires.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.001
What if I don't?

01:14:34.042 --> 01:14:36.918
Then I will wake you a dog.

01:15:38.001 --> 01:15:41.959
Why can't any of
you just kill her?

01:15:46.959 --> 01:15:50.059
- Get back!
- Huh, you think you can challenge me?

01:15:50.083 --> 01:15:54.018
You got nothing against me, you
think you can save the princess?

01:15:54.042 --> 01:15:55.876
I gotta a gift for you.

01:15:56.001 --> 01:16:00.918
"Hail the evil, hail the faith,
thou just killed, regenerate!"

01:16:12.001 --> 01:16:16.935
They were cruel to you when they're alive,
interesting to see how they treat you now.

01:16:16.959 --> 01:16:18.001
What have you done?

01:16:25.043 --> 01:16:30.083
My liege, listen to me, I know this
gonna be hard, please, listen within!

01:16:30.959 --> 01:16:33.083
You think he's got
cutting his heart?

01:16:34.083 --> 01:16:36.125
That's pretty
heartless to meaning.

01:16:38.083 --> 01:16:41.959
What do you think? You have nothing
with heart? What do you think?

01:16:42.083 --> 01:16:45.083
I think not!

01:16:47.001 --> 01:16:49.042
- I am sorry for you.
- Sorry for me?

01:16:49.083 --> 01:16:52.080
You sad, I can see it in your eyes.
The rest of

01:16:52.104 --> 01:16:55.125
your life, you will never
understand true love.

01:16:55.167 --> 01:16:57.001
You still hungry?

01:17:01.959 --> 01:17:04.083
Eat, eat.

01:17:06.042 --> 01:17:08.083
Finish him off!

01:17:50.918 --> 01:17:55.000
Ethan, thank God you're alive, I
never thought I'd see you again.

01:18:20.042 --> 01:18:23.001
Tambria, I am not done with you!

01:18:35.918 --> 01:18:38.083
I defeat your death, you
rage, your monsters!

01:18:38.125 --> 01:18:41.042
Not all of them
(ROARING)

01:18:50.918 --> 01:18:54.001
There, it's done! Release her.

01:18:54.125 --> 01:18:57.001
Very well, begone!

01:18:59.001 --> 01:19:04.042
I surrender, I cannot carry
this weight any longer.

01:19:04.083 --> 01:19:08.959
I have nothing left, princess
is yours, so wake her up.

01:19:22.042 --> 01:19:25.001
Love does conquer the reward.

01:19:30.918 --> 01:19:33.083
Look out!

01:19:39.042 --> 01:19:41.001
You liar!

01:19:45.959 --> 01:19:48.976
He's death, you said
that love conquers all.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.001
And child, it has.

01:19:52.001 --> 01:19:55.001
But I stand with the
blood of my people.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:01.000
Woe that us perished at the
hand of the fire of the cruel.

01:20:01.083 --> 01:20:04.918
Rise up for the
death of the doom!

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.059
I revoke this place!

01:20:07.083 --> 01:20:14.001
Divine power, avenge my
blood and give me strength!

01:20:31.959 --> 01:20:34.959
Avenge my blood!

01:20:37.083 --> 01:20:42.083
Liege, if you don't pick up that sword and
stab that sleeping beauty in the heart,

01:20:42.876 --> 01:20:44.042
we're all liege!

01:20:53.083 --> 01:20:55.125
Come, come, all of you.

01:20:57.125 --> 01:21:03.043
Go to her. Go to her.

01:21:15.125 --> 01:21:17.001
No!

01:21:41.125 --> 01:21:43.918
No!

01:21:45.125 --> 01:21:53.125
A great creature, you... You kissed me.
Thank you.

01:22:03.001 --> 01:22:06.477
If you think that you
can ruin, this glorious

01:22:06.501 --> 01:22:10.001
future that I have conquer
the last hundred years,

01:22:13.083 --> 01:22:18.042
but since you are not sleeping
anymore, I am gonna to kill you!

01:22:18.125 --> 01:22:22.876
Stay back! That is no way
to speak to my princess.

01:22:22.918 --> 01:22:26.834
Tambriel, you are no longer
walk in here. Leave.

01:22:26.959 --> 01:22:30.042
Queen tambriel, you hence
banish from my kingdom!

01:22:33.043 --> 01:22:35.001
It is my kingdom!

01:22:59.042 --> 01:23:03.083
One year later.

01:23:23.876 --> 01:23:25.000
It's harmless.

01:23:31.125 --> 01:23:34.959
You may want to come in, my lady,
the party is about to begin.

01:23:35.001 --> 01:23:36.834
One moment.

01:23:38.043 --> 01:23:40.918
It just thing that I
have think long ago.

01:24:05.125 --> 01:24:08.042
All gents and ladies,
the princess dawn.

01:24:17.918 --> 01:24:20.042
I remember the story of
the day much likeness.

01:24:20.083 --> 01:24:22.059
- That was when I so young.
- You still young.

01:24:22.083 --> 01:24:26.876
- I am an a hundred years at least.
- Hmm, I guess we'll take.

01:24:27.001 --> 01:24:30.876
- Are you ready?
- I can hardly contain my self.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.956
Ladies and gentlemen, thank
you for coming for the

01:24:33.980 --> 01:24:36.959
celebration of the birth of
our first daughter, Dave.

01:24:37.959 --> 01:24:40.876
Come, the soul of
blessing upon her.

01:24:44.083 --> 01:24:46.125
May you always be safe.

01:24:59.918 --> 01:25:03.918
And then it is,
happily ever after.

01:25:10.918 --> 01:25:12.894
Or perhaps not

01:25:12.918 --> 01:25:15.959
I would like to present
a gift upon the child.

01:25:16.059 --> 01:25:21.059
