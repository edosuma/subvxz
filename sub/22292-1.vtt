00:22.731 --> 00:24.357
I don't need it. I'm telling you.

00:24.441 --> 00:28.028
Just because you don't feel sick now
doesn't mean you don't need the shot.

00:28.111 --> 00:30.989
I never get sick, okay?
You can take that and give it to Barry.

00:31.072 --> 00:34.826
- His nose is always running.
- What are you giving me shit for?

00:34.909 --> 00:38.788
I saw you earlier today. We said hi.
I said, "Cole." You said, "Mr. Daisy."

00:38.872 --> 00:42.041
Why are you giving me shit today?
I mean, it's just a needle, man.

00:44.169 --> 00:47.172
Damn. Come here, get the shot.
Ain't nothing to be scared of.

00:47.839 --> 00:50.759
There's 62 kids came here,
got a shot, no problem.

00:50.842 --> 00:54.179
You come in here, take ten minutes?
I got 84 kids more to go. Okay?

00:54.262 --> 00:57.223
We're boys. Be cool. Shit, man.
Are you gonna take this shot?

00:57.307 --> 01:00.310
Step over here and take the shot,
just like you'd take some ass.

01:00.393 --> 01:02.604
There's nothing to be scared of.

01:03.354 --> 01:04.355
I'm not scared.

01:06.900 --> 01:08.610
[Cole screaming]

01:16.284 --> 01:17.869
Pussy!

01:22.624 --> 01:24.459
[school bell rings]

01:27.295 --> 01:29.839
[Melanie] Did you know only one baby
was born on the Mayflower?

01:30.632 --> 01:32.050
How crazy is that shit?

01:32.759 --> 01:34.719
His name was literally Oceanus.

01:34.803 --> 01:36.513
He didn't even have a nationality.

01:37.013 --> 01:38.973
Just a citizen of the sea, I guess.

01:39.766 --> 01:41.434
What class did you learn that in?

01:41.851 --> 01:45.188
[scoffs] No one learns anything in class.
That's why we have the Internet.

01:46.606 --> 01:49.234
[rap music playing over speakers]

01:49.984 --> 01:51.694
[Melanie sighs] There's my dad.

01:51.778 --> 01:53.613
[Melanie's dad] Melanie, get over here.

01:53.696 --> 01:55.532
It was his high-school dream car.

01:56.741 --> 01:59.536
He got it after the divorce
to make Mom jealous, but...

01:59.828 --> 02:02.205
- it didn't work because it's a car.
- [Melanie's dad] Now.

02:03.873 --> 02:06.209
Dad, can we give Cole a ride home?

02:07.001 --> 02:09.753
Cole, are your parents expecting you
to take the bus home?

02:11.131 --> 02:12.549
- I guess so.
- Yeah, they are.

02:12.632 --> 02:14.551
So, you should take the bus, okay, sport?

02:14.926 --> 02:17.178
Sorry, dude.
I'll see you, though, neighbor, huh?

02:17.720 --> 02:18.888
- I didn't...
- What's that?

02:18.972 --> 02:19.973
[engine revving]

02:21.307 --> 02:23.768
- NASCAR Nation, bitch. Whoo!
- [Melanie] Dad...

02:27.272 --> 02:28.273
[Melanie] Dad!

02:43.663 --> 02:46.499
[Jeremy]
Ooh-whah, ooh-whah. Ooh-whah, ooh-whah.

02:46.583 --> 02:47.876
Well, well, well.

02:48.835 --> 02:51.129
[Jeremy] Hey, Colonoscopy.
How's it hanging?

02:52.255 --> 02:53.756
I don't know. Okay?

02:53.840 --> 02:56.301
Well, speaking of hanging,
have your balls dropped yet?

02:56.384 --> 02:59.929
- [boys laughing]
- [Cole mumbling]

03:01.181 --> 03:02.181
I didn't catch that.

03:02.765 --> 03:05.685
I said,
"Why are you so interested in my balls?"

03:05.768 --> 03:07.645
Last thing he cares about is your balls.

03:07.729 --> 03:10.481
[Jeremy] Yeah, 'cause on Saturday,
I hooked up with Shelly MacEntyre.

03:10.565 --> 03:11.565
The sophomore?

03:11.900 --> 03:15.111
The sophomore.
But in many ways, she was a senior.

03:15.737 --> 03:18.197
- I don't believe you.
- You don't need to believe him.

03:18.281 --> 03:20.909
It's not like your belief will validate
what happens to his dick.

03:20.992 --> 03:22.035
Wanna know how it was?

03:24.329 --> 03:25.496
No, not really.

03:25.580 --> 03:27.999
Well, see,
as a 14-year-old in that kind of situation

03:28.082 --> 03:30.501
with a 16-year-old
that looks like Shelly MacEntyre,

03:30.752 --> 03:32.128
it was overwhelming, man.

03:32.795 --> 03:34.297
I mean, she is a woman.

03:35.256 --> 03:37.967
Fully-developed, man.
It's crazy, man. It's... [grunts]

03:38.051 --> 03:39.594
Man, you know what I'm saying?

03:41.471 --> 03:43.389
I said, do you know what I'm saying?

03:44.098 --> 03:46.726
You just said it didn't matter
if I believed you.

03:46.809 --> 03:49.938
- Well, I changed my mind, bitch.
- Sorry, I wasn't...

03:52.523 --> 03:54.859
[Jeremy] Oh, my God. He's so weird.
[laughs]

03:55.485 --> 03:58.446
Ooh-whah, ooh-whah. Ooh-whah, ooh-whah.

03:58.529 --> 03:59.529
[woman] Hey!

04:06.537 --> 04:07.747
Did you just touch Cole?

04:08.289 --> 04:10.541
- So, what if I did?
- [woman] Jeremy, check it out.

04:11.042 --> 04:13.628
You so much as think about Cole again...

04:15.922 --> 04:17.048
and I'm gonna...

04:17.130 --> 04:18.298
[inaudible dialogue]

04:18.382 --> 04:21.803
♪ The girls wanna be her
The boys wanna be her ♪

04:22.345 --> 04:23.345
You crazy bitch.

04:25.265 --> 04:27.225
♪ The girls wanna be her ♪

04:27.308 --> 04:29.185
- [tire hissing]
- Now get out of here!

04:30.186 --> 04:32.188
Before I run you over,
you little Pap smear.

04:34.899 --> 04:36.484
- Hey, Coley.
- [Cole] Hey, Bee.

04:39.070 --> 04:40.070
These are new.

04:40.613 --> 04:42.824
Yeah, I have to wear them sometimes.

04:42.907 --> 04:45.326
They supposedly help strengthen
my left eye,

04:45.410 --> 04:48.621
- but I can't tell the difference.
- You look pretty strong to me.

04:49.872 --> 04:50.872
You skin your palms?

04:51.624 --> 04:53.918
- It doesn't hurt.
- Yeah, it does. Come here.

05:02.010 --> 05:04.512
- They bother you a lot?
- No.

05:06.264 --> 05:09.475
You look away when you lie, dude.
They the ones that egg your house?

05:11.978 --> 05:15.398
[sighs, clicks tongue]
You gotta punch them in the dick.

05:15.940 --> 05:18.776
And if they're chasing you,
wait until they've almost got you,

05:18.860 --> 05:21.446
drop like a bag of rocks,
then when they trip over you,

05:21.529 --> 05:23.990
and they're on the ground,
kick them in the dick.

05:27.243 --> 05:30.204
- Hey, so, tell me, how's the folks?
- Better, I think.

05:30.705 --> 05:32.165
Hotel therapy's working?

05:32.457 --> 05:34.042
[chuckles] No, come on, it's great.

05:34.125 --> 05:38.046
I mean, they're happy,
we get to hang out, and I get paid.

05:38.546 --> 05:41.340
- I'm like your little Protestant.
- [chuckles] What?

05:41.424 --> 05:43.801
'Cause, like, I have to pay you
to hang out with me.

05:44.302 --> 05:46.095
Are you trying to say "prostitute"?

05:46.596 --> 05:47.513
Oh, my God...

05:47.597 --> 05:50.808
No, that would make me the prostitute
and your parents the clients.

05:50.892 --> 05:53.269
That is a terrible analogy.
That is the worst one ever.

05:54.354 --> 05:55.605
- Oh...
- Besides,

05:55.688 --> 05:57.607
I'd wanna hang out with you either way.

05:58.357 --> 05:59.192
Really?

05:59.317 --> 06:00.985
One hundred percent.

06:01.527 --> 06:05.573
I got two years tops before you're
too cool to hang out with me.

06:05.948 --> 06:07.533
I'll never be too cool.

06:11.454 --> 06:13.706
[Bee]
Hey, is that the roof of your tree house?

06:13.790 --> 06:15.708
[Cole]
Yeah, we just started to take it down.

06:16.209 --> 06:18.711
I... I don't care. I mean, my, uh...

06:18.795 --> 06:20.588
Tree houses are for kids anyway.

06:21.589 --> 06:23.758
There's a lot of good memories
in there, right?

06:25.384 --> 06:26.384
Yeah.

06:26.552 --> 06:29.972
All right, tomorrow night. You. Me. Party.

06:30.807 --> 06:31.807
Sounds good.

06:33.184 --> 06:34.184
[gulps]

06:34.811 --> 06:35.811

06:40.191 --> 06:41.943

E.T. fingers.

06:43.903 --> 06:45.863
[both buzzing]

06:46.364 --> 06:48.408
- All right. See you, Cee.
- Bye-bye, Bee.

06:49.784 --> 06:50.993
[car door squeaks]

06:51.202 --> 06:54.622
Gotta get that door fixed.
You're still giving this to me, right?

06:54.705 --> 06:57.625
- One hundred percent.
- Can't have a sticky door on my car.

07:23.609 --> 07:24.609
Hey, Mom!

07:24.652 --> 07:26.362
[Mom] Hey! Cole.

07:27.613 --> 07:30.408
Cole, can you hand me one
of those traps, please?

07:31.117 --> 07:32.117
Ow.

07:32.952 --> 07:34.287
- Thanks. Hi.
- Hi.

07:34.871 --> 07:35.997
[grunts] Thanks, buddy.

07:37.748 --> 07:39.959
[groans] God. God.

07:40.042 --> 07:42.602
Mom, how can you be under there?
There's like a trillion spiders.

07:42.670 --> 07:46.466
[Mom] Cole, I don't like it under here.
It's pretty much the worst.

07:47.300 --> 07:49.594
- Do you think I'm a pussy, Mom?
- [thud] Ow.

07:50.136 --> 07:51.696
[Mom] Do you know what that word means?

07:51.762 --> 07:53.642
- [Cole] Yeah, like, afraid of everything.
- Ow.

07:54.849 --> 07:56.017
Um...

07:56.559 --> 07:57.559
Huh.

07:58.186 --> 07:59.437
Well... [sighs]

08:00.771 --> 08:05.526
I think... you are at a time in your life

08:05.693 --> 08:08.446
where a lot of things are scary.

08:08.946 --> 08:13.743
But as you get older, those same things
will stop frightening you as much.

08:14.327 --> 08:15.327
Okay?

08:17.747 --> 08:18.831
It's gonna be okay.

08:19.415 --> 08:23.169
[Cole] You should really get some
bug spray to kill the spiders in there.

08:23.252 --> 08:26.506
What have they done to you?
They eat other dirty bugs.

08:26.589 --> 08:28.257
Hey, will you get me a lemonade?

08:28.508 --> 08:29.508
- Yep.
- Thanks.

08:31.677 --> 08:34.597
Mom, I know "pussy" also means "vagina."
I'm not retarded.

08:36.890 --> 08:40.436
Cole Johnson. Do not say "retarded."

08:40.977 --> 08:43.081
- But I can say "pussy" or "vagi..."
- [drill whirring]

08:43.105 --> 08:44.232
Don't say it, okay?

08:44.774 --> 08:45.816
Go get me a lemonade.

08:50.279 --> 08:51.656
Oh, my God, he said "pussy."

08:52.615 --> 08:54.242
[man] Breathe in. Breathe out.

08:54.575 --> 08:56.827
- Unclench that sphincter.
- [Cole] Okay.

08:56.911 --> 08:59.413
- How those mirrors looking?
- Looking good.

08:59.497 --> 09:00.497
Parking brakes?

09:01.332 --> 09:02.166
Nope.

09:02.250 --> 09:04.293
- Hands?
- Ten and two.

09:05.002 --> 09:05.878
Engage.

09:05.962 --> 09:07.964
[engine revs, fades]

09:11.926 --> 09:15.304
Dad, did you know that seven teenagers
die a day from driving?

09:15.680 --> 09:17.139
Really? Wow.

09:17.473 --> 09:21.852
Did you know that, uh, 14 teenagers
die a day from over-worrying?

09:22.520 --> 09:23.563
I went on the Internet,

09:23.646 --> 09:26.107
and there's pictures of them.
They die like this:

09:30.111 --> 09:31.279
Maybe next week.

09:32.238 --> 09:34.115
All right, buddy, sure. You wanna swap?

09:34.657 --> 09:36.450
- Yeah.
- Good. All right. You did good.

09:37.243 --> 09:39.704
You started the car,
you put the seat belt on.

09:39.787 --> 09:42.123
Don't worry about it, pal.
There's no rush.

09:42.206 --> 09:44.917
It's okay to be scared.
It's not a big deal, okay?

09:47.295 --> 09:49.672
Hey, let me ask you something.
Do your friends...

09:49.880 --> 09:52.049
Do they make fun of you
for having a babysitter?

09:52.592 --> 09:53.592
Yeah.

09:53.884 --> 09:56.012
But then they see her
and get really jealous.

09:56.929 --> 09:58.806
Yeah. Heck, yeah, they do. [chuckles]

09:58.889 --> 10:01.851
I don't know about you, buddy,
but I'm feeling like a cop.

10:02.393 --> 10:04.145
I'm craving some donuts.

10:04.228 --> 10:05.730
[shouting]

10:08.065 --> 10:09.065
[Dad] All right!

10:10.234 --> 10:12.653
[both laughing]

10:18.409 --> 10:19.452
What are you watching?

10:19.535 --> 10:21.829
Your dad is bingeing on Mad Men.

10:21.912 --> 10:22.912
Again.

10:23.372 --> 10:24.373
You wouldn't like it.

10:25.041 --> 10:26.125
It's on HBO?

10:26.208 --> 10:28.794
- [chuckles]
- No, it's not... It's not dirty, buddy.

10:28.878 --> 10:29.754
It's not on HBO.

10:29.837 --> 10:32.256
It's dense, you know.
So, it might go over your head.

10:32.381 --> 10:35.092
When you get a little older,
we'll binge-watch it together.

10:35.176 --> 10:36.052
How about that?

10:36.135 --> 10:38.971
- [Cole] All right.
- Cole, will you clean up the toys

10:39.055 --> 10:40.139
in the hallway for me?

10:40.222 --> 10:41.557
Okay, Mom. Jeez.

10:41.641 --> 10:42.641
Thank you.

10:48.606 --> 10:49.607
[Cole] Much cleaner.

11:14.215 --> 11:15.341
Who cares?

11:16.675 --> 11:17.675
Hey. Oh.

11:17.843 --> 11:19.762
Hey, that doesn't seem safe at all.

11:19.887 --> 11:21.639
- I can handle it.
- Yeah. No, I get it.

11:21.722 --> 11:22.722
Stop. Stop.

11:22.890 --> 11:24.266
And hand me the knife.

11:25.351 --> 11:28.020
Fabulous.
Why you cutting up your car with a knife?

11:28.813 --> 11:30.731
I'm gonna switch the roof
with a fastback,

11:30.815 --> 11:32.055
- so it's aerodynamic.
- Uh-huh.

11:32.108 --> 11:34.276
It's gonna give me more downforce
on the turns.

11:34.360 --> 11:36.362
When it hits the ramp,
it'll do a barrel roll

11:36.445 --> 11:38.823
and smash into the crash zone
exactly how I intend...

11:38.906 --> 11:41.617
Got it, got it.
I applaud your passion for aerodynamics.

11:41.700 --> 11:44.829
I absolutely do, but only use this
if you're cutting a flank steak.

11:44.912 --> 11:46.455
And don't do that. That's my job.

11:46.539 --> 11:49.291
And if you take that job,
what am I doing at this house?

11:49.792 --> 11:51.252
Do you want me to put it back?

11:51.335 --> 11:53.021
[Dad] No. I'm gonna put this
in the dishwasher,

11:53.045 --> 11:55.172
'cause it's coated in my sweat and fear.

11:57.174 --> 12:00.344
My parents are going away again.
I think they go to have sex,

12:00.428 --> 12:03.347
but it just makes me feel like they go
to get away from me.

12:04.306 --> 12:05.975
They're definitely having sex.

12:06.058 --> 12:07.935
They probably have sex
when you're home, too.

12:08.436 --> 12:12.064
Besides, I bet Bee has boys over
at your place all the time doing it.

[pants] Wait, just give me...

26:05.021 --> 26:06.815
Give me a second to process that shit.

26:06.898 --> 26:09.609
- [John] You raised by Rick James?
- I'm thinking a redo.

26:09.693 --> 26:11.152
- That's amazing.
- [laughing]

26:11.236 --> 26:14.531
Make sure it's real nice and long for you,
because I'm black. See that?

26:14.614 --> 26:15.865
There you go. Mm.

26:17.284 --> 26:19.244
- [Bee giggles]
- Fuck, yeah.

26:19.661 --> 26:20.495
Come on.

26:20.578 --> 26:21.955
[Allison laughing]

26:22.038 --> 26:24.207
- Whoo!
- [Sonya] Yeah!

26:25.667 --> 26:26.710
[John] Oh, Bee!

26:26.793 --> 26:28.211
- [all laughing]
- [John groans]

26:28.295 --> 26:29.421
Bee, what the hell?

26:29.504 --> 26:32.382
You give her that romantic shit,
and you're gonna lick my face?

26:33.466 --> 26:34.968
Damn, that's all I'm asking.

26:35.051 --> 26:36.761
- [Bee] All right.
- [John] Freaky shit.

26:37.971 --> 26:40.807
Smell good. The spit is nice.
Brushed your teeth this morning.

26:42.642 --> 26:43.643
[Max laughing] Okay.

26:47.188 --> 26:48.231
- [John] Weird.
- [Bee] Hi.

26:48.315 --> 26:50.775
- [John howling]
- [Allison laughing] Yeah!

26:51.192 --> 26:53.486
[Max cat-calling] Sammy's turn.

26:54.613 --> 26:56.281
- [John laughing]
- [Max chanting] Sammy.

26:56.364 --> 26:58.575
- [Allison] She's so hot.
- [John] Okay.

27:00.160 --> 27:01.619
[Max] Come on, Sam. You got this.

27:02.120 --> 27:03.246
Make out with her.

27:03.621 --> 27:04.621
[Sam] I'm sorry.

27:05.373 --> 27:09.502
This is kind of weird.
I don't even really know you guys.

27:09.586 --> 27:12.047
[Max] Come on, Sam.
Freak you out, there, stud?

27:12.589 --> 27:14.924
- Sam, don't be a puss.
- [Sam] I don't even know you guys.

27:15.008 --> 27:16.301
[Sam] I'm not. I'm... I just...

27:16.926 --> 27:19.054
- You're staring at me.
- [Max] Oh, we're not looking.

27:19.137 --> 27:20.347
[Allison] Hey, it's not weird.

27:20.847 --> 27:21.931
- [Bee] Hey.
- [John] Yeah.

27:22.015 --> 27:23.266
Just close your eyes.

27:23.683 --> 27:24.726
Okay?

27:24.809 --> 27:26.311
Pretend they're not even here.

27:27.228 --> 27:28.228
You can do this.

27:28.730 --> 27:29.773
You got this.

27:30.649 --> 27:31.691
[hushes]

27:35.528 --> 27:39.032
Just because I close my eyes
doesn't mean that they're not here.

27:41.409 --> 27:42.409
Do you trust me?

27:43.953 --> 27:44.788
Yes.

27:44.871 --> 27:46.039
Just relax.

27:47.040 --> 27:49.250
It's not weird, okay?
We're just having fun.

27:50.543 --> 27:52.045
[John howls]

27:52.629 --> 27:53.672
There he goes.

27:54.672 --> 27:55.673
[John chuckles]

28:10.438 --> 28:12.190
[screaming]

28:26.621 --> 28:27.621
Shh.

28:29.165 --> 28:32.293
You're helping fulfill a great purpose.
Know this.

28:32.836 --> 28:35.880
I don't wanna fulfill a great porpoise.

28:35.964 --> 28:38.258
[grunts] Did he just say "porpoise"?

28:38.341 --> 28:39.592
Yo, I think he did.

28:39.676 --> 28:41.761
He didn't even get a chance
to understand.

28:42.262 --> 28:43.471
[panting]

28:44.639 --> 28:45.639
Ready?

28:46.224 --> 28:47.475
- [Sonya] Ready.
- Yep.

28:48.935 --> 28:50.687
- [John grunts] Oh, okay.
- [exhales]

28:52.063 --> 28:53.356
[John] That shit leaking.

28:58.236 --> 29:01.406
Wait, hold on. My shit ain't working.
I think it ran out of blood.

29:02.115 --> 29:04.159
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, shit.

29:04.242 --> 29:06.953
[John yells] Oh, shit!

29:07.036 --> 29:09.914
[Max]
All that blood was just in his boner.

29:09.998 --> 29:12.917
Max, don't laugh, okay?
John, relax. This blood is serving you.

29:13.001 --> 29:15.587
I did not sign up for this shit
to serve me in my mouth.

29:15.670 --> 29:18.214
This shit's still warm.
I think he got a fever.

29:18.298 --> 29:21.718
You know what you signed up for.
You want to go platinum, John?

29:21.801 --> 29:24.429
Things can get messy
when you make a deal with the devil.

29:24.512 --> 29:25.555
Now collect it.

29:25.638 --> 29:26.949
- [John] Like this?
- [Bee] There you go.

29:26.973 --> 29:30.435
[Allison] How long is this gonna take?
I just want my shit to come true.

29:31.186 --> 29:33.646
[Bee]
Allison, you'll all get what you want.

29:38.985 --> 29:40.403
Okay, let's go.

29:42.697 --> 29:45.074
[John] I don't think this is funny.
Look at my outfit.

29:45.158 --> 29:47.911
I just got this shit, you feel me?
Thirty percent off.

29:47.994 --> 29:50.663
Macy's. Top rack. I don't play games.

29:50.747 --> 29:52.415
You look like Carrie,

29:52.499 --> 29:55.001
- but black.
- Carrie would've been better black.

29:55.084 --> 29:57.629
She would have been covered in Hennessy,
all right?

29:57.712 --> 30:00.340
What are you wearing?
Looking like Big Bird's side bitch.

30:00.423 --> 30:03.551
I just came from a game.
That's why I'm wearing this, obviously.

30:03.635 --> 30:05.011
I was not gonna miss this.

30:06.471 --> 30:10.308
Look at this shit.
That would go viral so hard.

30:10.391 --> 30:12.185
I mean, nobody's done human sacrifice.

30:12.268 --> 30:14.229
People have always done human sacrifice.

30:14.312 --> 30:18.233
Yeah, but, like...
not in America with hot people.

30:18.316 --> 30:20.610
Sonya, get the cases.

30:21.069 --> 30:23.613
Listen,
when you're done being totally useless,

30:23.696 --> 30:27.617
get a rag and wipe Sacrifice Samuel
out my damn eye. OMG.

30:27.700 --> 30:28.785
Hey.

30:28.868 --> 30:29.869
Nice one, John.

30:29.953 --> 30:32.247
[gasps] Oh, my God.

30:32.789 --> 30:35.124
I've got Sacrifice Samuel all over me.

30:36.167 --> 30:37.293
What's in the box?

30:42.465 --> 30:45.969
Yo, so, Bee, why do you need the book
if you already know what to do?

30:46.094 --> 30:48.304
It's like Jesus asking directions
to heaven.

30:48.513 --> 30:49.931
Just fucking go up, you know?

30:50.473 --> 30:54.102
Well, the Jews have their scrolls,

30:54.185 --> 30:55.979
Christians have their Bibles,

30:56.062 --> 30:57.856
and the devil has his verses.

30:58.398 --> 31:00.817
Don't touch it.
It's very old and very delicate.

31:01.359 --> 31:02.359
It's the only one.

31:02.986 --> 31:05.613
You recite the verse
while the blood hits the page.

31:05.697 --> 31:07.323
Without it, none of this happens.

31:09.325 --> 31:13.246
Let's get started before we head upstairs
and get the blood of the innocent.

31:13.329 --> 31:14.831
[gasps]

31:26.301 --> 31:27.486
[woman]
911, what's your emergency?

31:27.510 --> 31:30.471
My name is Cole Johnson.
A guy was murdered in my living room.

31:30.555 --> 31:33.433
The address is, uh... 2455 Bigby Drive.

31:33.516 --> 31:36.936
- Can you please send someone?
- Are the attackers still in the house?

31:37.020 --> 31:38.605
They're downstairs having a blast.

31:38.688 --> 31:40.648
- How many are there, Cole?
- Too many.

31:40.732 --> 31:44.402
Can you please get my mom?
She's at the Hyatt in the city.

31:44.569 --> 31:45.569
Living large.

31:45.612 --> 31:49.157
Of course, Cole. Now listen to me.
It's important that you stay hidden.

31:50.325 --> 31:53.453
- I gotta protect myself. Thanks.
- Do not do that. No, no, no...

32:20.104 --> 32:23.650
- Okay.
- [chattering]

32:36.829 --> 32:39.540
[Bee] ...we shed about 15 percent
of our dead cells.

32:39.624 --> 32:40.624
[John] Whoo!

32:42.085 --> 32:44.170
Yo, this kid's hobby
must be getting bullied.

32:45.964 --> 32:47.382
He's reading The Secret?

32:47.465 --> 32:50.051
He's ten years old.
What secret he need to know?

32:50.551 --> 32:51.594
Won't he hear us?

32:52.095 --> 32:54.973
With the amount of drugs I gave him?
Hell, no.

32:55.682 --> 32:59.686
- [Sonya] Good boy. Pretty boy.
- Do you have the needle?

33:01.771 --> 33:03.189
Of course, I have the needle.

33:08.361 --> 33:11.197
You know, there is a faster way
to get all that blood.

33:12.407 --> 33:14.047
[Bee] What happens when you kill someone?

33:14.117 --> 33:16.369
[John] They lose, like,
all they Instagram followers.

33:16.452 --> 33:19.497
- [gasps] Oh, my God, that would suck.
- No, they die.

33:19.580 --> 33:21.833
And then I'd have
to find another innocent kid.

33:21.916 --> 33:25.628
And all of this only works
if we get that top-shelf pure shit.

33:27.088 --> 33:29.340
And Cole is basically a faucet
of that for us.

33:41.519 --> 33:43.187
[Bee] After this, we finish the ritual...

33:44.272 --> 33:45.732
and your wish comes true.

33:49.193 --> 33:50.820
- Damn, I missed the vein.
- [Sonya] Mm.

33:53.031 --> 33:55.450
[Bee] Premium real estate. Go for it.

33:58.661 --> 34:00.663
[Sonya incanting]

34:09.130 --> 34:10.715
Wait, you gotta give him a Band-Aid.

34:10.797 --> 34:12.467
Okay. Let's go mix some blood.

34:12.550 --> 34:13.760
John, alley-oop.

34:14.844 --> 34:15.928
[John] LeBron James.

34:19.139 --> 34:20.139
Good boy.

34:43.706 --> 34:45.708
[panting]

35:49.105 --> 35:50.106
Why is he shirtless?

35:51.440 --> 35:55.027
- That's your first question?
- How can you ask that? Just look at him.

35:55.111 --> 35:56.195
I still don't get it.

35:59.240 --> 36:00.616
[grunting]

36:01.617 --> 36:02.869
Give him a cookie.

36:05.121 --> 36:07.957
- No, thanks.
- Eat the cookie.

36:08.541 --> 36:11.127
I just don't really like cookies, okay?
Bee knows that.

36:13.462 --> 36:15.590
You'll feel better if you eat.
You fainted.

36:15.673 --> 36:16.591
No, I didn't.

36:16.674 --> 36:17.674
Yes, you did.

36:18.676 --> 36:19.844
After I took your blood,

36:19.927 --> 36:22.305
I waited in the room,
because something felt off.

36:22.388 --> 36:25.224
I crouched behind the door.
A few seconds later, you got up,

36:25.308 --> 36:27.935
tied a sheet to your bed,
threw the sheet out the window.

36:28.019 --> 36:30.354
And then you fainted. So, you know...

36:30.438 --> 36:32.356
Your blood sugar is low. Eat the cookie.

36:38.446 --> 36:39.446
Are you mad at me?

36:39.906 --> 36:41.490
Cookie.

36:43.075 --> 36:45.411
This is gonna be so good.

36:47.079 --> 36:48.079
What the...

36:48.915 --> 36:50.082
Oh, there you go.

36:50.875 --> 36:52.001
There you go.

36:55.421 --> 36:56.422
That's a good boy.

37:04.722 --> 37:07.266
- Why are you awake, Cole?
- Because I couldn't sleep.

37:07.350 --> 37:09.230
- I don't believe you.
- [Cole] Okay, fine. I...

37:09.310 --> 37:10.895
I was gonna go smoke in the woods.

37:10.978 --> 37:12.688
[Bee] You were gonna go smoke
in the woods.

37:13.856 --> 37:17.068
Yeah. You know, like... marijuana.

37:17.151 --> 37:19.737
You weren't gonna share with your boy?
Come on, man.

37:19.820 --> 37:22.490
We could've got high,
listen to my mix tape. My shit's fire.

37:22.573 --> 37:24.951
- I wanna smoke pot.
- Why didn't you drink the shot?

37:25.034 --> 37:27.370
Why is he shirtless?
Why did you take my blood?

37:27.453 --> 37:29.997
- Cole.
- Okay. Fine. Because I don't like alcohol.

37:30.081 --> 37:32.708
I just drank it
because I wanted you to think I was cool.

37:35.836 --> 37:37.755
Why did you give a 12-year-old alcohol?

37:37.838 --> 37:40.508
'Cause I put shit in that alcohol
that makes them conk out

37:40.591 --> 37:41.759
for eight hours or more.

37:43.386 --> 37:44.512
What else did you see?

37:45.888 --> 37:47.390
I just see you.

37:48.182 --> 37:51.143
And these assholes,
who I don't know, in my house.

37:54.021 --> 37:57.358
- Why is his shirt covered in blood?
- No one would let me borrow a shirt.

37:58.317 --> 38:00.361
- That's not even an answer.
- Oh, my God.

38:00.444 --> 38:03.948
Does he not see the mirror behind him?
We can see you cutting the rope.

38:05.700 --> 38:06.784
Well, he does now.

38:09.161 --> 38:11.205
Aw, it's so cute,
you're still cutting the rope.

38:11.289 --> 38:13.833
Look at you.
You're really trying there, aren't you?

38:15.126 --> 38:17.712
- Why are you cutting ropes?
- I don't like being tied up.

38:17.795 --> 38:19.672
- Why do you have a knife?
- It was a gift.

38:19.755 --> 38:20.755
Oh, my God.

38:21.257 --> 38:22.633
He's still cutting the ropes.

38:23.175 --> 38:25.136
Determined little fucker, aren't you?

38:26.637 --> 38:29.140
Look, I won't tell anyone.

38:29.223 --> 38:31.684
Okay? You know me.
I'm good with secrets.

38:32.059 --> 38:34.437
I won't tell my parents
that you were having an orgy

38:34.520 --> 38:35.855
and needed my blood to do it.

38:35.938 --> 38:37.398
[John and Allison laughing]

38:42.445 --> 38:44.488
Do you even know what an orgy is?

38:45.031 --> 38:47.074
I'm guessing it's something sad people do

38:47.158 --> 38:49.535
'cause they want other sad people
to like them,

38:50.036 --> 38:53.039
and they can forget for one minute
how sad they are in general.

38:54.123 --> 38:56.000
That's actually a pretty good answer.

38:56.625 --> 38:58.794
It was for a science project, okay?

38:59.545 --> 39:00.545
The orgy?

39:00.921 --> 39:02.381
No. The blood.

39:02.465 --> 39:04.717
Orgy is when a bunch of people
have sex together.

39:04.800 --> 39:06.280
We wouldn't need your blood for that.

39:09.055 --> 39:10.723
You could've just asked.

39:11.307 --> 39:13.768
I would've let you have some blood
for science.

39:13.893 --> 39:15.644
I knew you were afraid of needles.

39:15.728 --> 39:17.688
This was clearly a misunderstanding.

39:17.772 --> 39:18.939
Sonya, untie him.

39:19.940 --> 39:21.984
I'm sorry we scared you, Cole. We good?

39:22.360 --> 39:23.360
[police sirens wailing]

39:24.445 --> 39:25.905
- [John] Oh, shit.
- [screaming]

39:26.781 --> 39:28.741
- [Max] Shut up!
- Holy fuck!

39:28.824 --> 39:30.868
- Not good.
- Fucking police.

39:31.452 --> 39:33.204
Why are the cops outside, Cole?

39:33.537 --> 39:35.206
- I don't know.
- Did you call them?

39:35.289 --> 39:38.060
- No. You said you were in the room.
- Makes me think you saw something

39:38.084 --> 39:40.461
that scared you enough
to call the cops. Right, Cole?

39:42.171 --> 39:43.839
- [knock on door]
- Oh, fuck!

39:43.923 --> 39:45.007
Answer me, Cole.

39:45.549 --> 39:47.968
Help! Help!
I'm tied up inside! They're about...

39:48.844 --> 39:50.096
[grunts] Ow.

39:51.097 --> 39:52.737
- Oh, shit!
- [officer] Everybody, freeze!

39:52.807 --> 39:55.351
[officer 2] Hands up, now!
Put your hands up! Now!

39:55.434 --> 39:56.477
- Now!
- [Max] Here we go.

39:56.560 --> 39:57.937
- [officer] Hands up!
- [John] Oh!

39:58.062 --> 39:59.814
[screaming]

39:59.897 --> 40:01.690
- [chuckles]
- [officer] Shit!

40:01.774 --> 40:05.319
Hands up. Don't shoot, man.
Black lives matter, too. You feel me?

40:05.403 --> 40:06.862
[Allison] Bee!

40:06.987 --> 40:07.987
- Oh!
- [Max] Oh, shit!

40:08.739 --> 40:09.824
Titty gone!

40:10.366 --> 40:11.492
Titty gone!

40:11.575 --> 40:14.662
Don't you move. Keep your hands up.
Nobody move!

40:15.830 --> 40:17.498
- [screams]
- Don't you move.

40:17.581 --> 40:18.916
[John] Chill with the gun stuff.

40:18.999 --> 40:21.085
Chill. You Mexican, right?
Look, I speak Spa...

40:21.168 --> 40:23.212
Lo siento, my nigga, lo siento.

40:24.630 --> 40:26.090
[shouting]

40:26.465 --> 40:28.426
- Are you serious?
- [laughing]

40:30.302 --> 40:31.679
[screaming]

40:31.762 --> 40:33.139
[John] Max, what you doing, man?

40:33.222 --> 40:35.558
- [John] Max, what you doing, man?
- No, no, no!

40:36.308 --> 40:37.560
- [officer 2 shouting]
- Oh.

40:38.727 --> 40:40.396
[grunting]

40:40.479 --> 40:41.479
No!

40:43.023 --> 40:44.275
Harder.

40:45.985 --> 40:47.736
[screaming]

40:48.362 --> 40:49.405
Whoo!

40:49.488 --> 40:52.283
Look, man.
Three out of four people got an STD.

40:52.450 --> 40:54.034
I got two people's blood on me.

40:54.535 --> 40:57.288
You do the math.
I got AIDS. I know I got AIDS.

40:57.371 --> 40:58.664
You killed him!

40:59.165 --> 41:01.417
- Kind of your fault, bud.
- Are you insane?

41:01.500 --> 41:02.835
No, Cole. I'm just trying...

41:02.918 --> 41:06.589
[man on radio] What's the status
of that 187 call on Bigby Drive?

41:09.383 --> 41:10.426
[John] Look, man.

41:10.509 --> 41:12.761
I can't go to jail.
Y'all killed the cops, man.

41:12.845 --> 41:14.555
I ain't involved with this shit.

41:14.722 --> 41:16.098
It's fine. Max, pick it up.

41:16.557 --> 41:17.557
[Max chuckles]

41:17.725 --> 41:19.059
[John] It's the statistics.

41:19.143 --> 41:21.645
They say you either end up in jail
or dead.

41:22.146 --> 41:24.064
It's gonna be both for me, Bee.

41:24.148 --> 41:26.859
- What's the code for "all clear"?
- [man] What's your status?

41:27.401 --> 41:28.986
Just say "all clear."

41:29.069 --> 41:30.529
[Sonya] Why would he know cop codes?

41:30.613 --> 41:31.947
[Cole shouts]

41:32.198 --> 41:34.116
Stop screaming and act like an adult.

41:34.200 --> 41:36.076
What's the code? I know you know it.

41:36.160 --> 41:38.204
Little boy here a nerd.
Tell them the codes.

41:38.787 --> 41:39.787
What's the code?

41:39.955 --> 41:42.041
- Ten-fifty-three.
- [John] Punch that shit in.

41:42.541 --> 41:45.044
- [man] Bynak, you there?
- Wait.

41:47.546 --> 41:50.007
[Bee] You don't get it.
You look away when you lie.

41:52.051 --> 41:54.136
You look me in the eyes
and tell me the truth.

41:54.220 --> 41:55.971
What is the code for "all clear"?

42:02.645 --> 42:05.022
It's 10-4. Obviously.

42:05.105 --> 42:07.274
What's "we're taking a break to get food"?

42:07.358 --> 42:09.438
- [Cole] Say we're taking a break to...
- [Bee] Cole.

42:09.568 --> 42:11.445
[man] Officer Bynak, you need backup?

42:11.862 --> 42:13.072
Code seven.

42:17.618 --> 42:19.870
Ten-four, all clear. We're code seven.

42:25.501 --> 42:27.141
[man] Ten-four.
Enjoy your double-double.

42:30.130 --> 42:31.382
Should've been a cop.

42:34.093 --> 42:36.136
[screaming]

42:37.012 --> 42:37.930
Shit.

42:38.013 --> 42:39.640
[groaning] Ow, ow!

42:41.183 --> 42:42.685
[Allison] Oh, my God. Guys.

42:43.143 --> 42:45.521
Oh, my God!

42:45.604 --> 42:47.940
Fucking help me. What are you doing?

42:48.232 --> 42:50.484
Oh, my God. He shot me in the boob.

42:50.568 --> 42:53.362
What kind of dick shoots a girl
in the boob?

42:54.572 --> 42:58.200
- I did not sign up for this shit.
- Stop complaining. Stop all your whining.

42:58.284 --> 43:01.203
They're totally gonna stop growing.
They weren't even done.

43:01.287 --> 43:03.122
Sometimes you gotta settle, all right?

43:03.205 --> 43:05.499
I got a cousin Chantelle, titties flat.

43:05.583 --> 43:06.917
Personality real good.

43:07.001 --> 43:08.460
Ow. Oh, my God.

43:08.544 --> 43:10.462
- Ow! You fucking bitch.
- [Sonya laughs]

43:10.546 --> 43:11.714
What's wrong with you?

43:12.840 --> 43:16.135
- Get away from me with your fucking beret.
- She's gonna bleed out.

43:17.052 --> 43:18.052
What? No.

43:18.095 --> 43:20.180
What do you mean, I'm gonna bleed?

43:20.264 --> 43:22.433
Can we just stick a tampon in it
or something?

43:22.933 --> 43:25.978
Oh, my God.
We need to call an ambulance, guys.

43:26.061 --> 43:28.814
I need an ambulance.
I don't wanna lose my boob.

43:28.897 --> 43:29.940
I can't do that.

43:30.024 --> 43:31.024
[Allison] What?

43:31.692 --> 43:32.692
Why not?

43:32.735 --> 43:35.070
Because your boob was shot
by a now-dead cop.

43:35.154 --> 43:36.322
Have fun explaining that.

43:36.405 --> 43:38.782
No dude's gonna motorboat these, Bee.

43:38.866 --> 43:40.492
- [crying]
- [mimicking motorboat]

43:40.576 --> 43:43.037
How you like it?
You want them quick or you want them long?

43:43.120 --> 43:46.040
[continues mimicking motorboat]
You want a little spit on them?

43:48.208 --> 43:49.208
[Bee] Cole!

43:49.335 --> 43:51.175
- [Allison] Oh, my God.
- [John] Hey, hey, hey.

43:51.253 --> 43:53.589
Who's gonna want to suck on my nipples?

43:53.881 --> 43:54.715
No one.

43:54.798 --> 43:56.884
[John] Cole. Come here, Cole.
Stop running.

43:57.384 --> 43:59.845
Come here, little baby.
Yeah. Come here, buddy.

43:59.928 --> 44:01.930
Just wanna talk. Just wanna talk.

44:02.514 --> 44:03.724
Son of a bitch.

44:03.807 --> 44:05.726
Hey, this ain't Home Alone.
Hey, hey, hey.

44:06.101 --> 44:07.101
Oh, shit.

44:13.233 --> 44:14.233
[exhales]

44:18.322 --> 44:19.698
Oh, shit.

44:20.991 --> 44:23.494
Right in the jugular. Yeah! [chuckles]

44:24.995 --> 44:25.995
[gasps]

44:26.038 --> 44:27.915
- Get him.
- I got him.

44:27.998 --> 44:30.209
I'm gonna kill you with my bare hands.

44:30.292 --> 44:31.126
Whoo!

44:31.210 --> 44:33.671
- Now I gotta clean this up.
- [Max] Run, Cole!

44:34.505 --> 44:35.798
I'm coming for you.

44:37.341 --> 44:38.884
Open the door, Cole.

44:41.303 --> 44:43.305
No locked doors, Cole!

44:43.389 --> 44:46.266
Open the door. We just wanna talk, Cole.

44:49.603 --> 44:50.896
Come on, Cole!

44:57.611 --> 44:59.071
[panting]

45:05.536 --> 45:07.496
Hey, Coley. How's it hanging?

45:08.122 --> 45:09.248
[fabric stretching]

45:09.873 --> 45:11.917
Please, don't kill me. Please.

45:15.879 --> 45:17.548
No. You're gonna kill me. No.

45:19.007 --> 45:21.385
Max. It's okay, Max. Please.

45:22.970 --> 45:24.138
Got you.

45:25.681 --> 45:26.807
Ow!

45:27.349 --> 45:29.601
Whoa. Deep breaths, buddy.

45:30.394 --> 45:31.687
[coughs, groans]

45:38.277 --> 45:39.695
[Max] I'm right on your ass, Coley!

45:39.778 --> 45:40.821
Keep moving!

45:43.240 --> 45:44.450
Come on, Cole!

45:47.119 --> 45:48.579
Where are you, you little shit?

45:49.371 --> 45:50.539
Cole.

45:51.415 --> 45:52.249
Coley.

45:52.332 --> 45:53.332
[panting]

46:13.145 --> 46:14.480
[shouts]

46:22.029 --> 46:23.155
There's a dead guy...

46:25.115 --> 46:26.115
I'm sorry.

46:28.035 --> 46:29.035
I'm sorry.

46:31.914 --> 46:33.457
[shouting]

46:35.083 --> 46:36.376
Okay. Okay. Okay.

46:37.878 --> 46:39.296
Bug spray. Blanket.

46:42.466 --> 46:43.466
Lighter.

46:52.267 --> 46:54.645
Whoa. The Fat Dragon.

46:58.732 --> 46:59.732
[Max] Coley!

47:02.069 --> 47:03.403
Cole!

47:06.740 --> 47:08.909
Come out and play!

47:25.842 --> 47:28.136
[Cole panting]

47:40.691 --> 47:42.150
[footsteps above]

48:32.618 --> 48:34.244
[Sonya whispers] Is this where you are?

48:36.455 --> 48:37.831
[laughing]

48:40.042 --> 48:42.044
[Sonya hums]

49:03.857 --> 49:04.900
[creaking]

49:08.195 --> 49:09.195
[shouts]

49:22.709 --> 49:24.670
Are you right... here?

49:36.640 --> 49:37.849
Good boy.

49:40.060 --> 49:40.977
[gasps]

49:41.061 --> 49:42.729
Beautiful boy.

49:46.108 --> 49:47.567
So soft, so pretty.

49:47.651 --> 49:49.319
[Max] Coley!

49:50.445 --> 49:53.031
- Where's Cole?
- [Sonya] Ugh.

49:54.408 --> 49:58.286
[Max] Sonya, bring your cookies
and help me find this little fuck.

49:58.495 --> 50:00.122
[Sonya] I'm coming.

50:00.664 --> 50:01.665
[whimpers]

50:13.593 --> 50:14.928
Hi, Cole.

50:15.846 --> 50:17.180
Oh, God.

50:17.264 --> 50:20.767
How long do you think
it'll take your parents

50:21.184 --> 50:23.895
to find your body down here? [chuckles]

50:24.521 --> 50:25.521
Tomorrow?

50:26.857 --> 50:28.150
Two days from now?

50:28.775 --> 50:29.901
Even later?

50:29.985 --> 50:34.281
Probably when your body starts
to reek like cheese.

50:34.364 --> 50:38.076
[laughs]
Or we could just burn your body, Cole.

50:38.452 --> 50:40.287
It would be so beautiful.

50:41.204 --> 50:42.247
[Sonya screams]

50:42.956 --> 50:44.458
[laughs] Oh, you missed.

50:45.542 --> 50:46.918
[Sonya screams]

50:47.002 --> 50:48.044
My nails!

50:48.754 --> 50:53.425
Cole! Cole! [grunts]

50:54.259 --> 50:56.553
- [thuds]
- [grunts]

50:57.345 --> 51:01.057
I'm gonna make sure
you hurt before you die, Cole.

51:04.770 --> 51:07.314
Cut your fingers off. Every single one.

51:07.397 --> 51:08.774
Come here, Cole!

51:08.857 --> 51:11.860
I'm making
a human self-centipede. Yeah!

51:16.073 --> 51:18.241
Human self-centipede, child!

51:18.325 --> 51:20.577
Gonna taste so good, Cole!

51:20.660 --> 51:23.163
Your mouth is gonna get sewn
to your ass, Cole!

51:23.246 --> 51:25.040
Your mouthy ass!

51:25.832 --> 51:28.293
[screaming]

51:32.214 --> 51:33.590
[Sonya continues screaming]

51:40.555 --> 51:42.140
I'm still alive motherfuck...

51:42.224 --> 51:43.391
[loud bang]

51:43.475 --> 51:45.143
[gasping]

51:48.104 --> 51:49.105
[coughing]

51:56.071 --> 51:57.948
[applauding]

52:03.578 --> 52:05.121
Did you just blow up Sonya?

52:06.498 --> 52:07.498
No.

52:08.583 --> 52:11.086
I mean, I'm not even mad.
I'm a little surprised.

52:11.461 --> 52:12.587
What did that?

52:13.588 --> 52:14.588
A firework.

52:14.631 --> 52:15.465
A firework?

52:15.549 --> 52:16.800
Holy shit.

52:17.801 --> 52:18.969
Damn, good for you, kid.

52:19.678 --> 52:20.971
That is awesome.

52:21.304 --> 52:23.306
So, you want a head start?

52:24.474 --> 52:27.269
- Come on, you're the quarterback.
- Life's not fair, dude.

52:27.352 --> 52:28.436
You guys suck.

52:28.520 --> 52:29.646
You just blew up Sonya.

52:33.066 --> 52:34.317
You can't outrun me, Cole.

52:37.571 --> 52:40.365
Wait until they've almost got you,
drop like a bag of rocks.

52:41.575 --> 52:42.784
[Max grunts]

52:43.410 --> 52:44.661
[Bee] Kick him in the dick.

52:44.744 --> 52:45.579
Dick.

52:45.662 --> 52:46.705
[Max groans]

52:55.630 --> 52:56.630
Whoo!

52:59.134 --> 53:00.427
You missed my dick.

53:01.261 --> 53:02.971
- No, I didn't.
- Pretty sure you did.

53:03.054 --> 53:04.180
And I got a big dick.

53:04.973 --> 53:05.807
No, you don't.

53:05.891 --> 53:07.017
That's just hurtful.

53:07.309 --> 53:08.768
[shouting]

53:09.853 --> 53:10.896
Please, don't... Don't...

53:13.648 --> 53:14.983
[gasping]

53:15.066 --> 53:16.192
[Max] No whining.

53:16.276 --> 53:17.276
Save some dignity.

53:20.447 --> 53:21.447
[egg breaking]

53:23.658 --> 53:26.244
- What the hell is that?
- [gasping]

53:26.328 --> 53:27.787
- Huh?
- It's Jeremy.

53:28.997 --> 53:30.081
- What?
- Eggs.

53:31.124 --> 53:32.125
Eggs.

01:08:41.075 --> 01:08:45.121

01:09:15.401 --> 01:09:16.777
Now I gotta skip town again.

01:09:17.278 --> 01:09:19.363
And that leaves you,
and what to do with you.

01:09:19.446 --> 01:09:22.283
- Any suggestions?
- Are you gonna shoot me?

01:09:22.825 --> 01:09:23.825
No.

01:09:24.076 --> 01:09:27.830
No. I was just shooting around you,
'cause I thought you'd put your hands up.

01:09:31.750 --> 01:09:33.042

01:09:36.380 --> 01:09:37.380

- No.

01:09:42.886 --> 01:09:45.139
- Cole, listen to me.
- No, Bee! You listen to me!

01:09:46.223 --> 01:09:50.978
I've been hunted,
you've stolen my blood, killed people,

01:09:51.060 --> 01:09:53.981
shot at me,
and just been general assholes all night.

01:09:54.064 --> 01:09:56.942
So, I wanna know
what the hell's going on.

01:09:57.359 --> 01:10:00.738
Cole, you're too young to understand,
okay? Just trust me.

What, just because I'm 12 means I get
to be treated like total shit

01:10:09.205 --> 01:10:11.874
by you and Jeremy and everyone else?

01:10:11.957 --> 01:10:14.835
You know what?
You're Don Draper from Mad Men.

01:10:15.085 --> 01:10:17.963
How he's all cool and handsome
and everybody loves him,

01:10:18.047 --> 01:10:21.008
then he goes home and you find out
he has a wife the whole time.

01:10:21.091 --> 01:10:24.637
- He's such a piece of shit!
- Did you just ruin Mad Men for me?

01:10:25.471 --> 01:10:27.514
It's not even on anymore. You'll live.

01:10:27.598 --> 01:10:28.724
Still.

01:10:31.227 --> 01:10:34.146
- What happens when you leave here?
- What do you mean?

01:10:34.230 --> 01:10:35.940
- I will burn this!
- Okay.

01:10:36.148 --> 01:10:38.609
Cole... what do you want to know?

01:10:41.237 --> 01:10:42.321
What's the blood for?

01:10:42.655 --> 01:10:46.242

And, basically, you get whatever you want.

01:10:56.710 --> 01:11:00.798
I used to be so small... and so scared.

01:11:03.425 --> 01:11:06.845
Now I'm strong... and I'm confident...

01:11:08.597 --> 01:11:10.224
and that's all I ever wanted.

01:11:13.727 --> 01:11:15.521
And, so, that's all I was to you.

01:11:18.857 --> 01:11:21.568
You just used me to get what you wanted.

01:11:22.695 --> 01:11:23.695
No.

01:11:25.239 --> 01:11:26.782
No, Cole. I chose you.

01:11:28.284 --> 01:11:30.286
I mean,
I could've shot you and not Allison,

01:11:30.369 --> 01:11:31.912
but I didn't. I chose you.

01:11:32.621 --> 01:11:33.914

No.

And you'll leave here
and just find another faucet.

01:11:54.518 --> 01:11:58.480

- I heard everything. This is my house.

01:12:00.316 --> 01:12:01.316
Okay.

01:12:02.401 --> 01:12:03.401
Okay, yes.

01:12:04.653 --> 01:12:07.698
And tonight sucked,
but we can start again.

01:12:12.369 --> 01:12:13.495
So, you have a plan?

01:12:14.121 --> 01:12:16.206
Yeah. We just say they attacked us.

01:12:17.541 --> 01:12:18.541
I got him.

01:12:19.335 --> 01:12:20.335
Whoo!

No one will ever hurt you ever again.

01:12:40.022 --> 01:12:43.275
There'll be nothing left to be afraid of.
Isn't that what you wanted?

01:12:47.738 --> 01:12:48.906
What do you say, Cole?

01:12:54.203 --> 01:12:55.203
