WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:03.712
Are we gonna do this double-parked,
or are you gonna come inside?

00:03.795 --> 00:06.172
NARRATOR:
<i>Previously on</i> Hill Street Blues...

00:06.256 --> 00:08.174
The lockers at the 119th Street depot--

00:08.258 --> 00:10.427
There's more payoffs there than a bank!

00:10.510 --> 00:14.431
Seltzer also claims that Midtown Vice
is completely compromised.

00:14.514 --> 00:15.682
Let's follow it out, Frank.

00:15.765 --> 00:18.601
This could go anyplace.
This could reach into my office.

00:18.685 --> 00:19.519
(police siren wailing)

00:19.602 --> 00:21.938
NARRATOR:
<i>And now, tonight on</i> Hill Street Blues...

00:22.022 --> 00:25.275
They're both dead, Sliker and O'Connell.

00:25.358 --> 00:26.693
JOE: You hit your boy, Mr. Rutledge?

00:26.776 --> 00:29.112
He do something bad, I punish him,
that's a parent's right.

00:29.195 --> 00:33.033
Every dirty finger points
to the Special Vice Enforcement Unit.

00:33.116 --> 00:35.035
Hey, baby, they're in.

00:35.118 --> 00:38.038
Marino, Goldblum, and Fox.

00:38.121 --> 00:40.874
I had an appointment
with my doctor this afternoon.

00:40.957 --> 00:43.043
-Is something wrong?
-Yes.

00:43.126 --> 00:44.294
Go ahead! Let her jump!

00:44.377 --> 00:45.879
He's under arrest. Get him off the roof.

00:45.962 --> 00:47.797
MR. RUTLEDGE: Kill yourself! Jump!

00:50.050 --> 00:53.053
(indistinct conversations)

00:53.136 --> 00:54.637
Item 11.

00:54.721 --> 00:56.389
-(screaming)
-(squeaking)

00:56.473 --> 00:58.308
It's coming this way!

00:58.391 --> 00:59.809
Okay...

00:59.893 --> 01:03.063
Rats, that's five sightings this morning.

01:03.146 --> 01:06.274
We've told Division.
Pest control is supposedly on its way.

01:06.357 --> 01:10.737
In the meantime,
I suggest you all step carefully

01:10.820 --> 01:12.572
wherever you'd expect to find them.

01:12.655 --> 01:14.783
-(laughter)
-Item 12.

01:14.866 --> 01:19.329
Because of the recent bag-lady slashings,
Detective Belker goes undercover today.

01:19.412 --> 01:22.082
Mick will be working in the vicinity
of Dekker and Waverly.

01:22.165 --> 01:23.500
Backups are Hill and Renko.

01:23.583 --> 01:25.293
What's he supposed to be?

01:25.376 --> 01:26.669
A bag or a lady?

01:26.753 --> 01:28.088
(laughter)

01:29.506 --> 01:30.507
HENRY: Item 13.

01:30.590 --> 01:35.887
Inner-urban anti-crime
Visible Presence Pilot Program...

01:36.262 --> 01:39.099
i.e. a federally funded
storefront on Van Buren,

01:39.641 --> 01:42.936
this storefront will operate
as a kind of mini-precinct.

01:43.019 --> 01:45.021
The federal government wants to find out

01:45.105 --> 01:48.566
if high-profile police presence
will ameliorate

01:48.650 --> 01:51.361
relations between police and locale.

01:51.444 --> 01:54.948
Will having police on the block
make people feel safer?

01:55.031 --> 01:57.617
I think we could answer that, "Yeah."

01:57.700 --> 02:00.120
Officers Bates and Coffey
will be in charge.

02:00.203 --> 02:01.287
Item 14...

02:04.082 --> 02:08.586
Officer Joe Ferentelli of Polk Avenue
died at 4:00 this morning,

02:09.045 --> 02:12.215
37 hours after he and his partner,
Tom Laws,

02:12.715 --> 02:15.510
were shot while their unit
was stopped at a signal light.

02:15.593 --> 02:17.804
As you know, Tom Laws died instantly.

02:17.887 --> 02:20.181
That's two fellow cops dead,

02:20.265 --> 02:22.392
ambushed mercilessly,
apparently at random.

02:22.475 --> 02:26.688
I don't have to tell you
how extra careful you should be...

02:27.647 --> 02:29.232
with a cop killer at large.

02:29.315 --> 02:30.483
Okay, let's roll.

02:30.567 --> 02:32.402
Is sarge gonna be back tomorrow?

02:32.485 --> 02:35.905
Sarge is in for a checkup.
My guess, he'll be back tomorrow.

02:43.371 --> 02:45.790
Well, maybe they should postpone
the storefront thing,

02:45.874 --> 02:48.918
-I mean, until we get the shooter.
-We've still gotta be cops.

02:49.002 --> 02:51.671
Man, it's gonna take a week
just to read what they want us to do.

02:51.754 --> 02:53.464
Might as well just barricade
the door with this thing.

02:53.548 --> 02:55.466
-You know Ferentelli?
-Went through the academy--

02:55.550 --> 02:57.218
I tell you, man,
if this is some political thing--

02:57.302 --> 02:59.721
-No way of knowing, Renko.
-Hi.

02:59.804 --> 03:03.266
Hello there, angel face!
Look, I got it right here, 1,600 beans.

03:03.349 --> 03:05.018
Now, I want you to bid slow,

03:05.101 --> 03:07.645
minimum jumps,
preferably in the sawbuck range.

03:07.729 --> 03:08.730
Hey, what's that?

03:08.813 --> 03:11.107
Do you remember that 500 cc Norton

03:11.191 --> 03:13.401
we found abandoned
under that bridge last Fourth of July?

03:13.484 --> 03:14.986
-Yeah.
-Well, today is--

03:15.069 --> 03:16.905
BOTH: The police auction.

03:16.988 --> 03:19.407
That's why you went around
tearing down those posters?

03:19.490 --> 03:22.410
-Did he tell you that one?
-Tell me? I was his lookout.

03:22.493 --> 03:26.497
Only $1,600 to buy a $4,000
custom-dream machine.

03:26.581 --> 03:27.540
One has to cover--

03:27.624 --> 03:29.375
-(screaming)
-(rat squeaking)

03:30.293 --> 03:31.461
What are you doing?

03:31.544 --> 03:33.713
-(rat squealing)
-What are you doing up here?

03:33.796 --> 03:36.007
Get out of here, you little--

03:36.090 --> 03:37.759
-Bad! Bad!
-Daryl Ann...

03:37.842 --> 03:39.719
Very, very bad!

03:39.802 --> 03:41.763
-Daryl Ann!
-Ooh.

03:43.848 --> 03:46.726
Now, what was all that fuss
about a little itty-bitty mouse like that?

03:46.809 --> 03:49.646
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

03:49.729 --> 03:51.439
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

03:51.522 --> 03:55.276
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

03:55.360 --> 03:56.986
(sirens wailing)

04:02.492 --> 04:06.412
(theme music playing)

05:17.567 --> 05:18.943
Next Thursday?

05:19.652 --> 05:22.113
Would you live with rats
until next Thursday?

05:23.072 --> 05:24.949
Sir, you insult this precinct.

05:25.742 --> 05:29.245
What? What is your name? What?

05:29.329 --> 05:30.330
Lieutenant...

05:30.413 --> 05:32.707
take a look at this, "Vibra-pest.

05:32.790 --> 05:35.084
Eliminate rats without poison or traps.

05:35.168 --> 05:38.087
Sound vibration removes rodents
quickly and permanently.

05:38.171 --> 05:39.839
Money-back guarantee."

05:40.423 --> 05:42.508
Exterminate rats with sound?

05:42.592 --> 05:45.845
Leo, old sport, how's your cash
and medical plan forms?

05:45.928 --> 05:46.763
Just a second, Lieutenant.

05:48.389 --> 05:51.768
Uh, just a handful of those
137 yellows ought to do it.

05:51.851 --> 05:56.189
Hey, Howard, Leo says we could exterminate
our rats with sound vibrations.

05:56.272 --> 06:02.195
LEO: "Reimbursement for psychiatric
or other mental-healthcare professional."

06:02.904 --> 06:04.113
Thank you.

06:04.530 --> 06:07.367
Yes, a strange and largely
unexplained phenomenon, amigo.

06:07.450 --> 06:09.827
It seems that your basic
European brown rat

06:09.911 --> 06:13.289
is supersensitive to certain
ultrasonic frequencies.

06:13.748 --> 06:17.919
The nervous system cuts out,
and the little fellas just roll up...

06:18.503 --> 06:20.421
Can we move up
looking at the house an hour?

06:20.505 --> 06:22.799
Uh, sure... I guess.

06:23.341 --> 06:25.676
-Is it a problem?
-Well, I have to call Fineman.

06:26.302 --> 06:27.720
Maybe we should look at it tomorrow.

06:27.804 --> 06:29.555
-No, I want to see it. Don't you?
-Sure.

06:29.639 --> 06:31.891
Well, I'll have it made for 10:30.

06:31.974 --> 06:33.142
Great. Thanks.

06:33.226 --> 06:35.853
I've got an appointment with-- Hi, Irwin.

06:35.937 --> 06:37.271
-Joyce.
-Bye.

06:37.355 --> 06:40.316
(sighs) Fletcher's arrived.
He's up in the war room.

06:42.693 --> 06:43.945
You're really lucky!

06:44.028 --> 06:45.822
You know what it's gonna
take to persuade you?

06:45.905 --> 06:50.660
Your whole apartment on fire
and blown up, and then you'll do--

06:50.743 --> 06:52.954
(indistinct shouting)

06:59.001 --> 07:00.711
(growling)

07:02.713 --> 07:04.173
Oh, no.

07:04.257 --> 07:06.467
-Wait! Wait!
-What? What?

07:06.551 --> 07:08.344
(groans)

07:08.428 --> 07:10.263
LEO: Mick! Phone call!

07:10.346 --> 07:13.099
Hey! Let's get up-- Get up here.

07:13.182 --> 07:15.810
I mean it. Get up walking here,
or I'm gonna choke you.

07:15.893 --> 07:18.396
-You put me in a bad mood today.
-What?!

07:19.981 --> 07:21.232
Hi, Ma.

07:22.358 --> 07:24.318
I'm fine. Just on my way out.

07:24.402 --> 07:27.822
-How are you?
-(clamoring continues)

07:27.905 --> 07:30.158
In what sense "second thoughts"?

07:31.325 --> 07:32.660
(sighs)

07:32.743 --> 07:37.874
Ma, I asked you last night, didn't I?
And you told me it had no sentimental va--

07:39.083 --> 07:40.626
So what's the problem?

07:42.420 --> 07:44.755
(chuckles) No way, Ma.

07:45.256 --> 07:47.133
Because you could never
put on that much weight.

07:47.216 --> 07:49.510
Aunt Sophie's much broader
through the chest,

07:49.594 --> 07:52.638
which is a curse as you grow older,
I know.

07:52.722 --> 07:53.848
The point is...

07:55.183 --> 07:57.977
Ma... Ma!

07:58.478 --> 08:00.730
-RENKO: Leo! Leo!
-Ma, enough now!

08:00.813 --> 08:03.232
-RENKO: Leo, Get him out of here.
-I asked you where I could find an outfit,

08:03.316 --> 08:06.152
and you volunteered one of Aunt Sophie's,
rest her soul.

08:06.777 --> 08:08.738
I can't! I'm in it!

08:09.864 --> 08:11.282
No, I'm using it.

08:11.365 --> 08:13.910
No, I am keeping it on.

08:16.162 --> 08:17.580
I look fine.

08:18.080 --> 08:19.457
I'll talk to you later.

08:20.291 --> 08:22.126
I will talk to you later!

08:22.210 --> 08:23.211
RENKO: Leo!

08:24.462 --> 08:25.755
I love you, too.

08:26.172 --> 08:27.423
Goodbye.

08:28.674 --> 08:32.470
FRANK: Every dirty finger points
to the Special Vice Information Unit.

08:32.553 --> 08:35.348
That's Lieutenant Marino,
Sergeant Fox, Sergeant Goldblum.

08:36.474 --> 08:37.600
Henry?

08:38.476 --> 08:40.353
Henry's Goldblume, not Blum.

08:41.604 --> 08:44.524
What about Jerry Fuchs?
Marino reports to Fuchs.

08:44.607 --> 08:45.566
Nothing so far.

08:45.650 --> 08:48.194
We've got the tentative link
from our shack and IAD

08:48.277 --> 08:49.654
down with the several vice grunts,

08:49.737 --> 08:51.906
but the real deal makers
seem to be those three.

08:51.989 --> 08:55.243
FRANK: Everything's still inferential
or statistical, Chief.

08:55.785 --> 09:00.206
Your bookie Seltzer hints at corruption,
he ends up with five bullets in his skull.

09:00.289 --> 09:02.667
-We don't have a witness.
-And Judge Cole dead-ends.

09:02.750 --> 09:04.210
Suicide is like that.

09:04.293 --> 09:06.295
The man was a coward. He had his chance.

09:06.379 --> 09:07.213
The hell with him.

09:10.007 --> 09:10.967
Damn!

09:12.593 --> 09:13.970
Keep a secret, gents.

09:17.098 --> 09:21.227
Our mayor-elect visited
the governor last week

09:21.310 --> 09:24.397
and proposed a new
anti-corruption commission.

09:24.480 --> 09:27.900
Sandler went nuts about the idea,
wants it in place in two weeks.

09:27.984 --> 09:30.903
-And you want us in there preemptively.
-Damn right.

09:31.195 --> 09:33.072
Dirt's in Cleveland's old precinct,

09:33.155 --> 09:35.658
and he's angling to come out
like the white knight.

09:35.741 --> 09:36.951
Pardon the expression.

09:37.660 --> 09:39.161
Give me some options.

09:41.872 --> 09:45.293
Marino and his partners
have their meals and spend some time

09:45.376 --> 09:47.378
at the Showroom Lounge over on Clifford.

09:47.461 --> 09:50.756
About a week ago, the owner, Eddie Bobbin,
got popped with a 13-year-old girl.

09:50.840 --> 09:53.175
We could try to turn him,
send some bugs in.

09:53.259 --> 09:55.219
The downside is if Bobbin's got a mouth.

09:55.636 --> 09:57.346
In which case, we'd lose Marino,

09:57.763 --> 10:00.850
but we'd still be seen as fighters,
actively battling the cancer.

10:00.933 --> 10:03.102
Uh, no disrespect intended, Chief,

10:03.185 --> 10:05.980
but Irwin and I have had
no home life for six weeks.

10:06.063 --> 10:09.150
We're looking for more than-than
just public relations here.

10:09.233 --> 10:12.862
No one wants to be rid of
systemic corruption more than I do, Frank.

10:12.945 --> 10:13.863
Do you doubt it?

10:15.448 --> 10:17.033
-Basically, I don't.
-Good.

10:18.492 --> 10:19.660
Your plan's a go.

10:20.286 --> 10:23.748
I've spoken with the DA, Irwin.
He's in step with whatever we decide.

10:24.206 --> 10:25.791
Let's move today.

10:25.875 --> 10:27.001
FRANK: We'll need some equipment.

10:27.084 --> 10:28.711
Call me with your shopping list.

10:29.879 --> 10:34.550
Frank, the day you walked into
Ben Seltzer's bookie joint to buy gum,

10:34.925 --> 10:37.053
the stars were looking out for us.

10:39.388 --> 10:40.681
(door opens)

10:41.349 --> 10:43.559
I thought Goldblum
was one of yours, Frank.

10:44.727 --> 10:46.187
That's Goldblume.

10:47.021 --> 10:48.397
Ah... right.

10:52.401 --> 10:55.029
LUCY: Here. "Desiderata number four...

10:55.112 --> 10:58.908
to selectively interdict
aggressively antisocial crime

10:58.991 --> 11:02.244
by forbearance vis-à-vis behaviors
that are technically illegal,

11:02.328 --> 11:04.622
yet acceptable as part
of the local ecology."

11:04.705 --> 11:07.625
In other words,
"Don't bust anybody for pot," right?

11:07.708 --> 11:09.335
That's all that stuff is saying.

11:10.294 --> 11:13.631
You know, this thing
is costing what, $1,200 a day?

11:13.714 --> 11:16.842
Why don't they just take the money
and give it to us, put it in our pockets?

11:16.926 --> 11:17.927
Here.

11:20.554 --> 11:23.432
Okay, your stolen bicycle was red?

11:23.766 --> 11:24.684
Uh-huh.

11:25.309 --> 11:26.852
JOE: And how much was it worth?

11:27.687 --> 11:31.023
-$50. Mama saved it up for me.
-(car horn honking)

11:31.691 --> 11:34.068
Look, we'll try to find it for you, okay?

11:34.151 --> 11:35.361
I hope so.

11:35.444 --> 11:37.571
It was a Christmas present from my mama.

11:37.863 --> 11:38.823
(door bangs)

11:38.906 --> 11:40.408
Hey, you got a problem out here.

11:40.741 --> 11:41.701
JOE: What?

11:41.784 --> 11:44.370
(car horn honking continues)

11:44.453 --> 11:47.957
-(indistinct shouting)
-(clamoring)

11:49.458 --> 11:52.795
-Quit throwing the garbage!
-Pull the plug and step out of the car.

11:52.878 --> 11:54.380
Tell him to shut up!

11:54.463 --> 11:55.965
I've got to get to work, man.

11:56.048 --> 11:58.008
Hey, you're disturbing
the peace on this block.

11:58.092 --> 12:00.469
-You can't be blowing your horn.
-He's the one that's disturbing!

12:00.553 --> 12:03.806
Hey, Jose, you pimp,
get your butt down here!

12:03.889 --> 12:05.349
If you know where the guy lives, why--

12:05.433 --> 12:08.102
I don't know nothing except
he's some reeking pimp.

12:08.185 --> 12:10.980
What good's a ticket?
The man's got out-of-state plates.

12:11.480 --> 12:13.315
-You got a coat hanger?
-No.

12:13.399 --> 12:15.317
Hey! He starts honking again,
you're gonna get my dinner!

12:15.401 --> 12:18.404
-Just you shut up up there.
-Well, come on up here and make me!

12:18.487 --> 12:20.865
-You're on the list, pal.
-Take it easy, Joe.

12:20.948 --> 12:24.243
There he is. I'm gonna
rip your face off, chump!

12:24.326 --> 12:25.161
-LUCY: Hold it!
-MAN: All right! All right!

12:25.244 --> 12:26.912
Yeah, well, just try it!
I'm ready for you!

12:26.996 --> 12:28.581
You smelly piece of garbage!

12:28.664 --> 12:30.040
Here, take this with you.

12:30.124 --> 12:31.125
I've been late three times
this week because of you!

12:31.208 --> 12:32.042
Let go, move it.

12:32.126 --> 12:34.170
But what do you care?
What do you know about making an honest--

12:34.253 --> 12:37.256
-JOE: Go move your car.
-(tires screeching)

12:37.339 --> 12:39.425
If I get docked for this,
I'm coming for you, Jose!

12:39.508 --> 12:40.593
(tires screech)

12:40.676 --> 12:43.763
What is he doing? Hey, Jose, NG, man.

12:44.138 --> 12:46.098
Jose, just keep doing it,

12:46.182 --> 12:47.933
and we're gonna keep
towing you until you stop.

12:48.017 --> 12:50.019
Tow me all the way to Cuba for all I care!

12:50.102 --> 12:51.604
Just quit hassling me, all right?

12:51.687 --> 12:53.898
-Hey!
-Leave it on the windshield, man.

12:53.981 --> 12:57.276
Can't sweat the small stuff.
I'll go call a tow truck.

13:01.030 --> 13:03.115
-Hey!
-(car horn honking)

13:03.199 --> 13:04.867
Okay, here it comes!

13:04.950 --> 13:07.077
(thuds)

13:07.620 --> 13:09.205
Luce, the guy threw his steak!

13:15.252 --> 13:16.337
This is Elvira.

13:16.420 --> 13:18.881
I just found a very nice, um...

13:20.049 --> 13:21.592
uh, nightshirt.

13:21.675 --> 13:23.677
Could be an excellent dipstick rag.

13:23.761 --> 13:26.263
RENKO:
<i>Anything in a 44 stout there, Elvira?</i>

13:26.347 --> 13:28.307
No, but I just found a truss.

13:28.390 --> 13:30.726
Can't get good cheese anymore.

13:30.810 --> 13:31.644
Huh?

13:31.727 --> 13:33.896
You ask for American,
they give you cheddar.

13:33.979 --> 13:36.607
-What are you, a Martian?
-No. Why?

13:36.690 --> 13:38.484
You got noises comin' out of you.

13:38.567 --> 13:40.945
Ooh, that's right. I am a Martian.

13:41.028 --> 13:45.574
My last husband was a Martian.
It's none of people's business anyway.

13:45.658 --> 13:48.410
-(cart clanking)
-(muttering)

13:48.494 --> 13:50.329
Earth to Elvira, y'all let us know

13:50.412 --> 13:52.206
when you want me
to beam you up, old scout.

13:52.289 --> 13:53.499
(laughter)

13:53.582 --> 13:57.211
Hey, Andy, you and Daryl Ann
want to join us for a late flick?

13:57.294 --> 14:00.172
Love to, Robert, but contingent on
a serious Norton dream machine

14:00.256 --> 14:01.757
in my foreseeable future tonight.

14:01.841 --> 14:03.217
Right.

14:03.467 --> 14:05.886
You know, Andy, you're a lucky man.

14:05.970 --> 14:08.514
That Daryl Ann is one fine,
straight-ahead woman.

14:08.848 --> 14:11.183
You calling my Tennessee
buttercup simple, Robert?

14:11.267 --> 14:12.768
No, not at all.

14:12.852 --> 14:16.021
I was just thinking about
how much Marty confuses me.

14:16.105 --> 14:19.525
That woman turns on and off
faster than a yellow light.

14:19.608 --> 14:21.360
Any creature that gorgeous

14:21.443 --> 14:23.779
has a right
to a few eccentricities, my friend.

14:23.863 --> 14:28.117
WOMAN (on radio): <i>All units, shots fired,</i>
<i>67th and Monroe. Officers down...</i>

14:28.200 --> 14:30.244
Mick, we got some cops down.
We're coming to get you.

14:30.327 --> 14:31.495
Twenty-two-oh-two responding.

14:31.579 --> 14:32.955
You got that, Mick?
We're coming to get you!

14:33.038 --> 14:35.416
(sirens wailing)

14:53.559 --> 14:54.768
They're both dead.

14:55.477 --> 14:57.187
Sliker and O'Connell.

14:58.272 --> 15:01.901
(siren wailing continues)

15:10.868 --> 15:13.120
So, if I'm a little nervous,
you'll understand.

15:13.203 --> 15:15.080
There's a lot more than money
invested here.

15:15.164 --> 15:16.999
Oh, I think it shows, Lou,
in the detail work

15:17.082 --> 15:18.626
and the way you've kept it up.

15:18.709 --> 15:20.753
Dorothy and I did it
for each other, really.

15:20.836 --> 15:22.630
Well, before she died,

15:22.713 --> 15:24.673
we were talking about
remodeling the kitchen.

15:24.757 --> 15:27.009
Oh, no, no, no.
What's there is good enough for now.

15:27.092 --> 15:28.802
I love the backyard,
and I like the neighborhood.

15:28.886 --> 15:31.472
-It really has a good feeling about it.
-And figure-wise?

15:33.057 --> 15:34.850
Well, I think it's in the ballpark,
don't you?

15:35.267 --> 15:36.602
I think we need to talk about it.

15:37.227 --> 15:40.522
Well, Frank, uh, you're my best salesman.

15:40.606 --> 15:42.441
Uh, I was hoping you'd get a sense of it.

15:42.524 --> 15:44.318
Here, or, uh...

15:44.860 --> 15:47.279
-here they can take a message.
-(paper rustling)

15:47.696 --> 15:51.450
Like I said, I close on the place
in Florida next week.

15:51.533 --> 15:53.869
-We'll call you by this afternoon.
-I'd appreciate it.

15:54.244 --> 15:57.539
I'd better lock up in back. Mrs. Furillo.

15:57.623 --> 15:58.749
Thanks, Lou.

15:59.875 --> 16:01.961
It's almost everything we want.

16:02.044 --> 16:04.171
It's also the first house we've looked at.

16:04.546 --> 16:08.092
-I know it's within our means.
-(pager beeping)

16:08.175 --> 16:10.928
-I think it's special--
-I think so, too, Frank.

16:11.011 --> 16:13.389
I just don't think we should
rush into anything.

16:13.472 --> 16:16.558
Uh, we'll talk about it later, okay?

16:16.642 --> 16:17.893
Okay.

16:21.063 --> 16:23.899
I don't understand you guys.
So they're making a few buys.

16:23.983 --> 16:26.068
I hear that undercover cops
are supposed to make buys.

16:26.151 --> 16:28.028
I mean, they make buys
from a dealer, and then you pop--

16:28.112 --> 16:30.322
Hey, come on, huh?
Don't insult our intelligence.

16:30.406 --> 16:32.700
These are dirty cops
doing dirty deals on your premises,

16:32.783 --> 16:34.284
and there's no way
you don't know about it.

16:34.368 --> 16:35.744
Get out of here.

16:36.203 --> 16:37.037
These guys...

16:37.121 --> 16:39.581
These guys are the most elite guys
in the whole department.

16:39.665 --> 16:41.417
NEAL: Hey, baby, they're in--

16:41.500 --> 16:44.503
Marino, Goldblum, and Fox.

16:45.087 --> 16:48.841
Come on, guys, corner booth. Corner booth.

16:55.764 --> 16:58.225
If Marino finds about this,
he ain't gonna be very happy.

16:58.308 --> 17:00.561
Good reason for not telling him, Eddie.

17:00.644 --> 17:04.189
Great reason for not taking minors
to no-tell motels, Eddie.

17:04.773 --> 17:06.191
She's my niece.

17:06.275 --> 17:07.276
Oh, well, in that case,

17:07.359 --> 17:09.737
they probably wouldn't
take your liquor license.

17:09.820 --> 17:13.866
Hey, look, Eddie, the DA's not gonna press
unless you give him a reason, okay?

17:13.949 --> 17:16.160
Scrambled, crisp bacon, OJ.

17:16.243 --> 17:18.787
Uh, prune Danish and a cup of coffee.

17:18.871 --> 17:22.624
Yeah, uh, let me have half a grapefruit
and a bowl of, uh...

17:22.708 --> 17:24.376
-Uh, what do you call that hot stuff?
-Cream of Wheat.

17:24.460 --> 17:25.502
Cream of Wheat, yeah.

17:25.836 --> 17:27.379
You know how gorgeous you look today?

17:27.463 --> 17:30.883
-Oh.
-(woman laughs) Hey. Thanks.

17:33.302 --> 17:35.054
NEAL: He's reading a newspaper.

17:35.137 --> 17:37.306
-(laughs)
<i>-Who wants the sports?</i>

17:38.849 --> 17:40.934
These guys are real bad criminals.

17:41.018 --> 17:43.937
I mean, you see the grapefruit?
That stands for "heroin."

17:44.021 --> 17:46.523
And the bowl of Cream of Wheat--
(chuckles)

17:46.607 --> 17:48.692
That's the bag to put the payoff in.

17:49.359 --> 17:50.736
Shut up, Eddie.

17:53.155 --> 17:55.908
-FRANK: Who was it, Ray?
-Sliker and O'Connell, South 3rd.

17:55.991 --> 17:58.786
Bastard's got a deer rifle.
It's like open season out there.

17:58.869 --> 17:59.787
Get in touch with Division.

17:59.870 --> 18:01.872
Find out which piece
they want us to take care of.

18:01.955 --> 18:03.082
Right away, Frank.

18:03.165 --> 18:05.793
-HENRY: Frank, talk to you a second?
-Sure.

18:05.876 --> 18:09.004
-You wanna go up?
-Uh, let's go to my office.

18:09.088 --> 18:10.214
Lineup's empty.

18:11.548 --> 18:13.884
LEO: I played cards with Sliker once.

18:15.052 --> 18:18.972
I tell you what, makes you
hesitate putting on a uniform.

18:22.768 --> 18:24.853
So what are you hiding up there,
the alchemists' stone?

18:24.937 --> 18:27.773
I think you know we're in the middle
of an operation, Henry.

18:28.232 --> 18:30.984
I know what I've heard.
I've heard inklings.

18:31.068 --> 18:33.362
The captain hasn't exactly
been too forthcoming.

18:33.445 --> 18:35.197
Wanna tell me what's on your mind?

18:37.407 --> 18:40.369
I understand you're up to something
in vice that seems pretty big.

18:40.702 --> 18:42.037
The truth is, I feel left out.

18:42.121 --> 18:44.373
Well, I shouldn't even be
saying this much, but...

18:45.374 --> 18:47.292
that's an ad hoc operation up there.

18:47.793 --> 18:49.378
It's essentially outside the precinct.

18:49.461 --> 18:51.713
Irwin Bernstein was afraid
his office might be compromised,

18:51.797 --> 18:53.966
so we improvised a secure place
for him to work.

18:54.049 --> 18:56.218
I guess this isn't the only thing
I've been feeling left out of.

18:56.301 --> 18:58.137
Why don't you tell me chapter and verse?

18:58.220 --> 18:59.638
I could, Frank, and I'm pretty sure

18:59.721 --> 19:02.391
you'd have a rational explanation
for every instance.

19:02.474 --> 19:04.476
It's my perception
that since there's been a change

19:04.560 --> 19:06.353
in my personal situation,

19:06.436 --> 19:08.564
there's been a change
in our professional relationship.

19:09.106 --> 19:11.650
-Meaning?
-Meaning since I've been with Fay.

19:12.526 --> 19:14.236
(sighs) There, we said it.

19:14.319 --> 19:17.156
Well, to tell you,
I've known about that for... six weeks.

19:17.239 --> 19:18.907
We've made no effort to conceal it.

19:18.991 --> 19:20.993
And I haven't done anything I'm aware of.

19:21.076 --> 19:23.745
You're not being aware of it
doesn't mean it hasn't happened!

19:23.829 --> 19:24.997
Look at it, Frank.

19:25.289 --> 19:27.541
You kept me away
from the Ben Seltzer homicide,

19:27.624 --> 19:29.793
Calletano's chief liaison
on the cop killings.

19:29.877 --> 19:30.836
You've locked me out.

19:30.919 --> 19:33.422
If that's true, Henry,
it was against my best intentions.

19:33.505 --> 19:36.175
Frank, are we gonna keep tap-dancing here,
or are we gonna work this out?

19:36.258 --> 19:37.301
What do you want?

19:37.384 --> 19:38.927
I want you to stop beating me up

19:39.011 --> 19:41.471
because I've got a relationship
with your ex-wife.

19:41.555 --> 19:43.056
I wanna do my job.

19:44.641 --> 19:46.351
You can't run the precinct alone.

19:47.853 --> 19:48.687
All right.

19:49.855 --> 19:52.024
You've certainly given me
plenty to think about.

19:54.693 --> 19:56.236
That's all I was trying to do.

19:56.320 --> 19:58.947
-(chattering)
-(typewriter clacking)

19:59.031 --> 20:01.909
Why don't you coordinate
with Ray on the shootings?

20:01.992 --> 20:02.910
All right.

20:09.541 --> 20:11.084
HENRY: Come on, everybody.
We still got work to do.

20:11.168 --> 20:13.629
-Anything we can do on this, Lieutenant?
-I'll let you know.

20:17.424 --> 20:19.468
Andy, it was pretty confusing,
but not as much as you said.

20:19.551 --> 20:22.179
I had to raise twice
to get around this guy, but I got it.

20:22.262 --> 20:24.765
-How much?
-$925.

20:24.848 --> 20:28.477
Whoo! Lord, I must have done something
right in this lifetime!

20:28.560 --> 20:29.853
Congratulations, cowboy.

20:29.937 --> 20:32.064
That's the safest model they make, too.

20:32.147 --> 20:34.107
-That's what the man told me.
-Was it blue, Daryl Ann?

20:34.191 --> 20:36.568
-Uh-huh.
-Lacquered midnight blue?

20:36.652 --> 20:39.196
Seemed like a powder blue
or puffin blue to me.

20:39.279 --> 20:41.490
You bought the wrong motorcycle,
Daryl Ann.

20:41.573 --> 20:43.617
-I what?
-Lot 259--

20:43.700 --> 20:46.745
chopped '59 lacquered Norton
midnight-blue special.

20:46.828 --> 20:49.248
You bought lot 239.

20:49.873 --> 20:53.335
-Shoot.
-I sent you out to buy the best motorcycle

20:53.418 --> 20:55.170
in the history of Western civilization,
and you come back

20:55.254 --> 20:58.173
with some parrot-blue, diesel-fuel,
Japanese poop scooter!

20:59.049 --> 21:01.593
Well, I guess I got the three
and the five mixed up.

21:01.843 --> 21:03.136
Yeah, I guess you did.

21:03.929 --> 21:05.347
I'll go back, okay?

21:06.431 --> 21:08.183
I'll go back, and I'll make it okay.

21:13.730 --> 21:16.275
Excuse me. Stuart Casey,
I write for the <i>Times Tribune.</i>

21:16.358 --> 21:18.694
I was wondering if I could talk
to you guys about these cop killings.

21:18.777 --> 21:21.405
-No, you may not.
-Not at this time, bud.

21:22.531 --> 21:25.075
-Can I help you?
-Yeah, I hope you can.

21:25.158 --> 21:27.452
-(gunshot)
-(clamoring)

21:27.536 --> 21:29.371
(clamoring continues)

21:29.454 --> 21:30.414
MAN: Let's go.

21:32.332 --> 21:33.583
MAN 2: Check the stairs.

21:35.294 --> 21:36.628
FRANK: Howard?

21:37.671 --> 21:39.047
Oh, Judas! I'm sorry, Frank.

21:39.131 --> 21:41.300
I never would have discharged
my weapon in the station,

21:41.383 --> 21:44.803
but that little bugger got me
with my flanks exposed.

21:45.554 --> 21:48.056
-Nice shot.
-I'll get a mop.

21:48.682 --> 21:50.559
-Excuse me.
-(chattering)

22:02.487 --> 22:03.572
ROBINSON: Mr. Orsini.

22:06.533 --> 22:07.826
Mr. Robinson.

22:13.457 --> 22:14.666
Uh, it's Sonny, please.

22:15.250 --> 22:16.209
Hey, Sonny.

22:16.877 --> 22:19.421
Call me Dave. Sit down.

22:24.968 --> 22:27.179
-So, did you find the place okay?
-(clears throat)

22:28.221 --> 22:29.431
Yeah, fine. Sure.

22:30.223 --> 22:31.099
What'll you have?

22:32.351 --> 22:34.686
Uh, rum and Coke.

22:34.770 --> 22:37.564
Rum and Coke, and, uh, give me
another one of these, will you, baby?

22:40.525 --> 22:42.110
So, Sonny, uh...

22:42.194 --> 22:44.488
I'm hearing some very
reputable things about you.

22:45.155 --> 22:46.782
Think we can make this thing work or what?

22:47.532 --> 22:50.577
Well, like the man says,
you got the time...

22:51.370 --> 22:52.496
I got the be here.

22:53.163 --> 22:54.122
Attaboy.

22:54.873 --> 22:58.210
-ROBINSON: <i>So what are you moving now?</i>
-SONNY: <i>Five, usual.</i>

22:58.293 --> 23:00.587
ROBINSON: <i>Uh, heavy week, seven.</i>

23:00.670 --> 23:03.965
-So far, he's by the book, babe.
-Yeah. It's early.

23:07.135 --> 23:08.136
Thanks, friend.

23:10.931 --> 23:12.557
Currently, uh...

23:12.641 --> 23:16.895
I was looking for maybe, uh, one or two,
uh, figures we discussed.

23:17.145 --> 23:19.564
Yeah, well, that's manageable. Absolutely.

23:20.315 --> 23:23.110
And if everything shakes out
to everybody's satisfaction,

23:23.193 --> 23:25.153
maybe we can work together
on a regular basis.

23:26.029 --> 23:27.030
That'd be good.

23:29.408 --> 23:32.619
I'll tell you what, you come back here
about half past 3:00.

23:32.702 --> 23:35.580
You'll meet my associates,
you'll bring a little something,

23:35.664 --> 23:38.583
and, uh, we'll do some business.

23:39.960 --> 23:41.503
All right. All right.

23:43.755 --> 23:45.549
Hey, finish your drink.

23:46.133 --> 23:48.051
Hey, this guy's a real charmer.

23:48.510 --> 23:50.011
He's scum.

23:51.054 --> 23:53.348
Unbelievable, the stuff people throw away.

23:53.432 --> 23:56.101
Look at this chair and lamps!

23:58.019 --> 24:00.397
I don't know,
this is a perfectly good lamp.

24:01.314 --> 24:02.274
(clangs)

24:02.357 --> 24:04.526
-(chuckles)
<i>-What the hell is this?</i>

24:04.943 --> 24:06.111
Oh...

24:08.822 --> 24:10.031
(chuckles)

24:11.032 --> 24:12.993
(screams)

24:13.076 --> 24:14.870
Cowboy, come on.

24:14.953 --> 24:17.289
You filthy-- (screams)

24:17.372 --> 24:19.541
(police sirens wailing)

24:19.624 --> 24:21.209
-(grunting)
-(groans)

24:24.129 --> 24:26.214
(tires screeching)

24:32.596 --> 24:34.097
-Mick...
-(yelling)

24:34.181 --> 24:36.183
-Damn, Mick!
-He cut me.

24:36.516 --> 24:38.059
He sure did.

24:38.143 --> 24:39.144
Come on. Walk this way.

24:39.227 --> 24:41.146
No, no, no, take it real easy, man.

24:41.229 --> 24:43.815
-Walk back here to me.
-BOBBY: All right, let's go.

24:43.899 --> 24:46.318
-You see this? You see this?
-Look, we got him!

24:46.401 --> 24:48.778
-MICK: Hit me from behind.
-(clangs)

24:55.744 --> 24:59.414
Oh, Frank, we have positive ballistics,
a 30-06--

24:59.498 --> 25:01.666
the same weapon was used
in both shootings.

25:01.750 --> 25:03.543
-Ammunition sales?
-We're running a check.

25:03.627 --> 25:05.045
Press hard, Ray. Good work.

25:05.128 --> 25:07.964
Frank, I heard about the two we lost.

25:08.048 --> 25:09.925
God, it makes me wish
I was back on the roster.

25:10.008 --> 25:12.219
Yeah, we could use you, Lou.
It's been a nightmare.

25:12.302 --> 25:13.762
A real nightmare. What's up?

25:13.845 --> 25:15.972
Well, I wanted to talk to you
about the house.

25:16.056 --> 25:18.016
Oh, listen,
Joyce and I haven't had a minute--

25:18.099 --> 25:20.519
Good, good, because I had a brainstorm.

25:20.602 --> 25:22.521
I want to do something special
for you two.

25:22.604 --> 25:24.940
I'm gonna knock the price down $3,000.

25:25.023 --> 25:27.067
Oh, Lou, are you sure?

25:27.150 --> 25:28.860
Frank, I gotta tell you this,

25:29.444 --> 25:33.532
I was really impressed with you two.
I want to try and make this work.

25:34.407 --> 25:35.325
Tell you what,

25:35.575 --> 25:37.911
we're meeting for dinner
at Tincanon's on West Fifth.

25:37.994 --> 25:39.663
I'll try to get her there
a half-hour early.

25:39.746 --> 25:41.540
Nice! I go there myself sometimes.

25:41.623 --> 25:43.917
-RAY: He's the exterminator?
-Hi!

25:44.000 --> 25:45.794
Monty Marr, Vibra-pest.

25:46.253 --> 25:47.546
Exterminator is an ugly word.

25:47.629 --> 25:51.883
Personally, I prefer
"rodent audio-services specialist."

25:51.967 --> 25:53.468
He's going to do it in a tuxedo?

25:53.552 --> 25:55.720
Well, you know,
I tried a turquoise three-piece once,

25:55.804 --> 25:59.474
looked sensational, only it didn't work
as well as the monkey suit.

25:59.558 --> 26:00.934
(box squeaks)

26:01.309 --> 26:02.894
-It's an accordion.
-Yep.

26:02.978 --> 26:05.146
Take a look at that
Mother-of-Pearl graining, huh?

26:05.230 --> 26:08.400
Switzerland, 1907.

26:08.483 --> 26:11.152
You won't find one like it
this side of St. Paul.

26:11.236 --> 26:12.612
RAY: What are you going to do with it?

26:12.696 --> 26:16.616
Well, I would like to start
with the "Beer Barrel Polka,"

26:16.700 --> 26:19.578
and then kind of vamp
right into "The Teddy Bear's Picnic."

26:19.661 --> 26:22.330
Your ad said you will
kill rats with sound.

26:22.414 --> 26:25.584
The ad doesn't say "kill."
The ad says "remove."

26:25.667 --> 26:31.089
Mr. Marr, you actually expect the rats
to follow you out of the building?

26:31.172 --> 26:33.675
-Or your money back.
-Oh, this is crazy!

26:33.758 --> 26:35.802
First, you gotta tell me
how far I can take 'em.

26:35.885 --> 26:38.013
Now, I can take 'em
ten blocks, if you want,

26:38.096 --> 26:39.347
but that's gonna cost you more.

26:39.431 --> 26:42.267
No, no, whatever's the usual.

26:42.350 --> 26:44.394
Well, the usual is four blocks.

26:44.936 --> 26:47.897
Okay, rats, let's go!

26:48.857 --> 26:51.443
("Beer Barrel Polka" playing)

27:07.375 --> 27:10.462
-I'll call the exterminator back.
-The guy's pretty good.

27:10.879 --> 27:13.048
-What happened to your arm?
-MICK: Nothin'.

27:13.131 --> 27:14.466
I think we got our slasher.

27:14.549 --> 27:16.551
-Where is he?
-He's in the hospital.

27:16.635 --> 27:17.802
Anything on the cop killer?

27:17.886 --> 27:19.804
We have no leads, good or bad.

27:19.888 --> 27:21.973
Put me on it, Lieutenant.
I want to work on it.

27:22.057 --> 27:23.224
All right, Mick.

27:23.725 --> 27:25.226
Welfare checks come tomorrow.

27:25.310 --> 27:28.396
I want a new mailbox
with a lock that works on it today.

27:28.480 --> 27:30.065
Hey, a new mailbox is 25 bucks!

27:30.148 --> 27:33.109
Yeah, and if they take you to court,
it's gonna cost plenty more.

27:33.985 --> 27:35.362
-All right?
-Okay.

27:35.445 --> 27:37.238
Hey, I'm gonna come by and check it out.

27:37.530 --> 27:39.574
All right, all right, all right.

27:44.621 --> 27:45.622
Excuse me.

27:46.706 --> 27:49.084
My name's Casey, from the <i>Times Tribune.</i>

27:49.167 --> 27:52.504
-Columnist.
-That's right.

27:53.004 --> 27:55.256
I read your stuff, not bad.

27:55.340 --> 27:57.884
-What can we do for you?
-Yeah, Lieutenant Goldblume

27:57.967 --> 27:59.135
referred me here to your precinct.

27:59.219 --> 28:01.596
Uh, okay if I ask a few questions?

28:02.722 --> 28:03.598
Sure.

28:04.224 --> 28:06.810
Great. Listen, if you don't mind,
I'd like to record this.

28:06.893 --> 28:09.354
Hey, wait, uh, what kind of questions?

28:11.106 --> 28:12.857
Somebody's killing cops.

28:12.941 --> 28:14.609
Yeah, that's right.
So you gotta write about it?

28:15.110 --> 28:16.027
Well, yeah!

28:16.111 --> 28:19.698
Look, pal, the last thing we need
is you telling us how tough it is, okay?

28:19.781 --> 28:21.199
It's bad enough.

28:21.950 --> 28:24.786
Well, wait, do you suppose
this guy reads the papers?

28:24.869 --> 28:27.372
Yeah, and I bet he picks up
the phone when it rings, too. So?

28:27.455 --> 28:30.542
Well, maybe he should read about
some cops with faces on 'em, huh.

28:31.334 --> 28:33.712
I mean, maybe he should know
he's just not shooting badges.

28:38.258 --> 28:40.051
-Turn it on.
-(door opens)

28:40.135 --> 28:43.179
Hurry, it's my brother!
He's gonna kill him up there!

28:43.263 --> 28:44.806
Hurry! Come on!

28:47.809 --> 28:51.062
He's in there! He's beating on him! Hurry!

28:51.146 --> 28:53.064
-(knocks on door)
-MAN: Yeah?

28:53.148 --> 28:54.482
JOE: Yeah, police! Open up.

28:55.608 --> 28:56.568
Yeah, what's the problem?

28:56.651 --> 28:58.778
LUCY: Mr. Rutledge,
we would like to see your son.

28:58.862 --> 28:59.946
Why?

29:00.029 --> 29:03.032
(stutters) What do you want?
Leave him alone.

29:03.491 --> 29:04.909
JOE: You hit your boy, Mr. Rutledge?

29:04.993 --> 29:07.162
He do something bad,
I punish him, that's a parent's right.

29:07.245 --> 29:08.788
Yeah, well, why is he in bed?

29:08.872 --> 29:11.750
Man, look, he gets sick a lot!

29:11.833 --> 29:14.294
(stutters) He can't hear. He's deaf!

29:14.836 --> 29:17.380
Ma'am, are you the boy's mother? Ma'am?

29:19.174 --> 29:20.759
He was sick this morning.

29:20.842 --> 29:22.343
You ain't got no right!

29:22.427 --> 29:23.887
This is my kid! That's my kid!

29:23.970 --> 29:26.097
Hey, you back off.
I'm not gonna tell you again.

29:26.723 --> 29:27.724
Let's go.

29:34.063 --> 29:34.939
(door closes)

29:36.232 --> 29:38.359
-We gotta call child welfare.
-With what?

29:38.443 --> 29:40.695
You can't make a case
without evidence of injury.

29:40.779 --> 29:42.363
So then what are we doing here?
What are we talking about?

29:42.447 --> 29:43.740
We can make a case!

29:49.370 --> 29:50.622
We'll be back.

29:56.795 --> 29:58.797
Ray, how are we coming
with the ammunition check?

29:58.880 --> 30:02.717
There have been a lot of purchases, Frank.
It will take a while to sort them out.

30:02.801 --> 30:03.802
I'm not optimistic.

30:03.885 --> 30:05.970
Coordinate with Division,
and keep me posted.

30:06.054 --> 30:07.972
I'm sorry, Mr. Marr, but I can't pay this.

30:08.056 --> 30:11.142
-Why?
-Well, your music was nice.

30:11.226 --> 30:13.144
It was top-notch, really.

30:13.228 --> 30:16.898
But to tell you the truth,
I didn't see a single rat follow you out.

30:17.524 --> 30:18.942
Well, you tell me where they are, then.

30:19.025 --> 30:21.236
Have you seen one rat
since I started playing?

30:21.528 --> 30:24.239
Mick, have you seen any rats
around the building

30:24.322 --> 30:26.115
-for the last couple of hours?
-Nope.

30:26.199 --> 30:29.410
-I really enjoyed your music.
-Oh, yeah, thanks.

30:30.787 --> 30:32.247
So you think it's funny, huh?

30:32.330 --> 30:34.415
A guy playing the accordion for rats?

30:34.499 --> 30:37.335
-It's a talent.
-Oh, I see, it's a talent.

30:37.418 --> 30:39.045
Let me tell you a little story.

30:40.046 --> 30:43.508
It's about this kid who used
to stay in his room all hours,

30:43.591 --> 30:45.677
listening to Lawrence Welk on his hi-fi,

30:45.760 --> 30:49.097
playing Dick Contino riffs
till his fingers bled.

30:49.597 --> 30:51.850
Then one day, he gets invited
to play a church social.

30:51.933 --> 30:54.936
Well, this kid, he's so thrilled.

30:55.019 --> 30:56.271
It's his big chance.

30:56.604 --> 30:59.107
The social is held down
in an old building by the river,

30:59.190 --> 31:01.985
so the kid starts playing, and he's good.

31:02.068 --> 31:03.611
He's playing "The Camptown Races."

31:03.695 --> 31:06.239
All of a sudden,
everybody starts screaming.

31:06.906 --> 31:09.284
There are rats all over the place.

31:09.951 --> 31:12.078
Pretty soon,
there's nobody left but the kid.

31:13.371 --> 31:14.455
The kid...

31:15.498 --> 31:16.666
and the rats.

31:19.460 --> 31:20.795
It's a curse.

31:21.212 --> 31:22.589
The kid is cursed.

31:23.840 --> 31:26.175
All he ever wanted to do
was to make music.

31:27.886 --> 31:30.555
LEO: Wait a minute.
I'm gonna write you out a voucher,

31:30.930 --> 31:34.017
but you have to take it over
to the municipal building.

31:34.809 --> 31:36.644
MARTY: Mr. Bernstein, hi.

31:36.728 --> 31:38.313
Officer Nichols,
what brings you to the slums?

31:38.396 --> 31:40.523
(chuckles) Must be some attraction here.

31:40.607 --> 31:43.026
Rumor has it that
you practically moved in.

31:43.860 --> 31:47.989
-Who said that?
-Oh, just my grapevine.

31:48.072 --> 31:49.240
Hi, Marty.

31:49.324 --> 31:51.951
Uh, sorry. I called.
You were already gone.

31:52.035 --> 31:52.994
Oh, what's up?

31:53.077 --> 31:55.163
Cop killings.
I'm gonna do another half shift.

31:55.246 --> 31:56.915
No problem. I understand.

31:56.998 --> 31:58.458
-BOBBY: Hi, Daryl Ann.
-RENKO: Well...

32:02.629 --> 32:03.755
I tried, Andy.

32:04.380 --> 32:05.882
All sales are final.

32:07.800 --> 32:10.970
-What about my Norton?
-Somebody bought it.

32:11.137 --> 32:13.640
-How much?
-$1,400.

32:13.723 --> 32:15.808
-$1,400.
-(sobs)

32:17.727 --> 32:19.228
I'm really sorry.

32:19.896 --> 32:21.898
I never felt so bad in my life.

32:28.863 --> 32:31.991
(sobbing)

32:34.243 --> 32:36.204
I'm just so dumb sometimes.

32:37.080 --> 32:39.958
Daryl Ann, it's not like
it's the end of the world or anything.

32:40.333 --> 32:43.044
I can't help it. I feel like it is.

32:43.461 --> 32:45.088
(crying)

32:49.509 --> 32:50.551
Here.

32:51.636 --> 32:52.720
What's this?

32:52.971 --> 32:54.931
It's $175.

32:55.473 --> 32:57.642
It's all I got except for $10
I had to leave in

32:57.725 --> 32:59.310
so they wouldn't close my account.

33:00.311 --> 33:03.940
Plus, I can give you $25 a week
and more when I get overtime.

33:04.023 --> 33:04.857
Daryl Ann...

33:04.941 --> 33:07.360
Plus, I'll put an ad
in the paper for the bike.

33:07.443 --> 33:08.653
It should sell real fast.

33:08.736 --> 33:11.489
I rode it around. It rides like a dream.

33:15.618 --> 33:16.452
Keep it.

33:18.955 --> 33:19.789
What?

33:20.665 --> 33:22.083
I want-- you should have it.

33:22.166 --> 33:25.169
But if I don't sell it,
it'll take me forever to pay you back.

33:26.963 --> 33:28.214
That doesn't matter either.

33:30.299 --> 33:31.259
But why?

33:33.803 --> 33:34.846
It's only money.

33:37.348 --> 33:38.808
Life's too short, darling.

33:39.726 --> 33:41.269
I care about you too much.

33:41.352 --> 33:44.022
Andy, I gotta do something
to square it with you.

33:44.605 --> 33:47.025
Uh, well, I'll tell you what...

33:49.152 --> 33:51.863
Tomorrow night,
you take me out for a great big dinner,

33:51.946 --> 33:53.448
and then we'll call it even, okay?

33:56.784 --> 33:59.746
(siren wailing)

34:05.501 --> 34:07.211
MR. RUTLEDGE:
Hey, get your hands off me, man!

34:07.295 --> 34:08.379
Get your hands off me!

34:08.463 --> 34:11.632
Go ahead! Let her jump!
And she can take that--

34:12.300 --> 34:13.968
He's under arrest. Get him off the roof.

34:14.052 --> 34:16.179
Kill yourself, bitch! Jump!

34:16.262 --> 34:19.140
-HENRY: Get him the hell out of here!
-MR. RUTLEDGE: She ain't nothin'!

34:19.223 --> 34:20.892
Jump, bitch, jump!

34:21.517 --> 34:24.312
I know you don't want to hurt
your child, Mrs. Rutledge.

34:24.896 --> 34:26.022
Let the boy go.

34:27.482 --> 34:29.901
It's better he dies with me than with him.

34:29.984 --> 34:32.612
Your husband will never know where he is.

34:32.779 --> 34:36.157
He'll be placed in a special school
where they can help him. He'll be safe.

34:37.283 --> 34:39.118
-It's too late.
-HENRY: You're wrong.

34:40.203 --> 34:41.829
Look at me, Mrs. Rutledge.

34:42.747 --> 34:43.623
Look at me.

34:49.170 --> 34:50.546
I promise you.

34:54.258 --> 34:55.635
I swear...

34:58.638 --> 35:00.014
If you're just saying it--

35:00.098 --> 35:02.183
I swear to God, I will make it happen.

35:04.060 --> 35:05.394
Please, Mrs. Rutledge.

35:06.437 --> 35:07.939
Let your son live.

35:29.460 --> 35:30.920
Now you, Mrs. Rutledge.

35:32.296 --> 35:33.506
Come on, give me your hand.

35:37.885 --> 35:40.555
My baby's all I had left.

35:41.139 --> 35:42.348
Is she coming down?

35:45.434 --> 35:47.103
Oh, Judas, uh...

35:48.479 --> 35:50.231
I know this isn't kosher, Henry, but...

35:50.940 --> 35:53.067
I'd like to have a try at talking to her.

35:55.403 --> 35:56.404
All right, Howard.

35:57.155 --> 35:58.406
Ma'am...

36:00.116 --> 36:02.326
Ma'am, I know-- I know you're very tired.

36:03.202 --> 36:04.120
(Howard scoffs)

36:04.996 --> 36:06.205
I-I guess I just...

36:07.582 --> 36:10.251
I just want to say one thing,
and-and that is that...

36:11.627 --> 36:13.004
Well, the world is full of stories

36:13.087 --> 36:15.423
of people that were rescued
at the last minute,

36:15.506 --> 36:18.301
people trapped in burning buildings,
lost in the forest.

36:18.759 --> 36:21.012
I don't mean to sound flippant,
it's just that...

36:21.971 --> 36:25.600
I know what kind of hell
you're going through.

36:26.100 --> 36:28.769
Most people have
a misconception about suicide.

36:28.853 --> 36:30.646
They think it happens
out of anger or bitterness.

36:30.730 --> 36:32.398
It isn't that way at all, it's fear.

36:33.191 --> 36:35.151
It's-it's like...

36:35.234 --> 36:37.445
It's like clinging
to a piece of wood in a flood,

36:37.904 --> 36:38.946
and your arms are aching.

36:39.030 --> 36:40.656
(sighs)

36:41.199 --> 36:45.786
Oh, Judas, I guess what I'm trying to say
is that I tried to kill myself once, too.

36:46.954 --> 36:49.165
And I was rescued at the last minute...

36:49.749 --> 36:50.833
by a friend.

36:51.876 --> 36:53.294
And now...

36:53.377 --> 36:56.214
now life is very precious to me.

36:57.924 --> 36:58.925
Oh...

37:00.259 --> 37:05.556
I'm... I'm here to save you, ma'am.
I'm here to pull you in out of the flood.

37:06.557 --> 37:08.434
Please, let me be your friend.

37:22.990 --> 37:26.035
(sobs)

37:42.343 --> 37:43.636
NEAL: Orsini just came in.

37:44.095 --> 37:45.930
-Where's he headed?
-Corner booth.

37:47.682 --> 37:50.351
NEAL: Two guys in behind him,
Goldblum and Fox.

37:50.434 --> 37:53.604
-No Marino?
-Uh-uh, no Marino.

37:56.023 --> 37:57.608
Hey, Mr. Orsini.

37:59.068 --> 38:00.695
You guys friends of Mr. Robinson?

38:00.778 --> 38:04.115
Yeah, as a matter of fact.
You got something for us?

38:04.991 --> 38:06.075
It's a possibility.

38:07.159 --> 38:08.869
We're real busy, Mr. O.

38:08.953 --> 38:11.080
We'd like to take a quick look,
if that's okay.

38:13.291 --> 38:16.377
Well, uh, I like to keep my friends happy.

38:18.671 --> 38:21.048
-Why don't you step into my office?
-Okay.

38:25.761 --> 38:26.637
(whispers) Hey.

38:27.263 --> 38:28.431
Headed for the john.

38:34.895 --> 38:36.480
I'm a cop!

38:36.564 --> 38:38.316
Hey, it's a mistake, Sonny, come on!

38:38.399 --> 38:40.568
What do you think I am,
some kind of slob, here?

38:40.651 --> 38:42.069
You know, this is not a takedown!

38:42.153 --> 38:44.155
-This is not a takedown.
-We're cops!

38:44.238 --> 38:46.782
-Easy!
-Easy, easy, I'm not going for my piece.

38:46.866 --> 38:49.577
I'm going for my badge,
for my badge, okay?

38:49.660 --> 38:50.745
All right. No problem.

38:50.828 --> 38:53.080
And what's that supposed
to make me feel better, huh?

38:53.748 --> 38:55.708
-(shouts)
-(clamoring)

38:55.791 --> 38:57.418
SONNY: Hold it!

38:57.501 --> 39:00.379
-Orsini stashed the guys.
-Turkeys.

39:00.463 --> 39:02.506
-Back 'em up?
-No way.

39:02.590 --> 39:03.591
What are you gonna do, Sonny?

39:03.674 --> 39:06.761
Are you gonna shoot a couple
of cops in a public bathroom?

39:06.844 --> 39:08.596
-There's no wire.
-Are you the one shooting cops?

39:08.679 --> 39:09.972
Come on, you're smarter than that!

39:10.056 --> 39:12.767
You guys are setting me up.
What, am I supposed to be grateful?

39:12.850 --> 39:15.353
-Where's your wire?
-There's no wire.

39:15.436 --> 39:18.022
-There's no wire, man.
-Sonny, this is not what you think.

39:18.105 --> 39:19.523
You got the wrong idea. Hear it out.

39:19.607 --> 39:22.026
Come on, you got some brains.
You're smarter than that.

39:23.069 --> 39:25.404
(sighs) All right. What?

39:26.864 --> 39:27.865
What?!

39:28.574 --> 39:30.701
-Turn around!
-Okay, okay.

39:30.785 --> 39:33.371
We don't want a mistake.
Nobody wants a mistake here.

39:33.454 --> 39:35.122
This is not a bust.

39:36.207 --> 39:37.291
Put the piece away.

39:37.375 --> 39:39.794
But wait a minute,
the other guy, uh, Dave,

39:39.877 --> 39:41.128
he's a cop, too, right?

39:41.212 --> 39:43.464
-Right?
-We're, uh, partners.

39:43.547 --> 39:46.217
We can all be partners. That's-that's
really where we're going with this.

39:46.300 --> 39:49.553
(panting) Oh, yeah?
What are you gonna do for me, partner?

39:49.637 --> 39:51.806
Can we lose the hardware, please?

39:51.889 --> 39:55.810
-Can we talk without that?
-Yeah, lose the hardware.

40:00.398 --> 40:02.900
Okay, you're showing some talent, Sonny.

40:02.983 --> 40:04.402
Yeah, just talk.

40:05.444 --> 40:07.738
Give the badges back.
We'll have a discussion.

40:12.326 --> 40:15.246
(screaming)

40:17.915 --> 40:20.084
-What's going on?
-I don't know.

40:20.960 --> 40:23.087
If you make one sound, you're dead!

40:23.629 --> 40:25.256
What'll we do for you?

40:25.339 --> 40:30.219
I will tell you what we do for you.
We are your partners, scum face!

40:30.302 --> 40:35.808
Twelve grand a week, every week,
and the first installment is tonight!

40:35.891 --> 40:36.892
You got that?

40:36.976 --> 40:38.978
And I'm gonna tell you
what your incentive is--

40:39.061 --> 40:42.606
your incentive is that we don't kill you.

40:42.690 --> 40:46.068
We let you live,
and every week, we're gonna vote on it.

40:46.152 --> 40:47.945
-You got that?
-(grunts)

40:48.028 --> 40:51.615
-In English!
-(stutters) Yeah.

40:51.699 --> 40:54.743
Two more popsicles
headed for the deepfreeze.

40:55.619 --> 40:57.830
-What about Marino?
-Patience, Neal.

40:58.164 --> 41:00.833
Five bucks says he's calling the shots.

41:04.795 --> 41:06.547
Sorry if I'm disturbing you, Frank,

41:06.630 --> 41:08.716
but I was on my way back
from government center,

41:08.799 --> 41:10.176
and there's something I feel
we ought to talk about.

41:10.259 --> 41:11.135
What?

41:11.594 --> 41:13.888
When was the last time you saw Frank, Jr.?

41:20.352 --> 41:22.938
-I just took him to the zoo.
-That was two weeks ago.

41:23.022 --> 41:24.815
And since then,
you haven't even called him.

41:24.899 --> 41:26.734
You know, he left two messages
on your machine,

41:26.817 --> 41:28.319
which you've never returned.

41:28.402 --> 41:29.945
He thinks you're mad at him
about something.

41:30.029 --> 41:31.322
Did you tell him I've been busy?

41:31.405 --> 41:33.991
Well, I would have if I thought
that was the problem.

41:35.701 --> 41:37.995
Look, I have cop killings
to deal with here.

41:38.078 --> 41:39.997
I mean, we lost two more men just today.

41:40.080 --> 41:43.751
With all due respect, Frank,
it's about Henry, isn't it?

41:43.834 --> 41:46.003
I mean, he told me you two
had a discussion this morning.

41:46.086 --> 41:48.297
-Fay...
-Frank,

41:48.380 --> 41:50.508
you have been treating me
like I'm Typhoid Mary

41:50.591 --> 41:52.384
ever since Henry and I got together.

41:53.093 --> 41:55.262
And your son's getting caught
in the fallout.

41:55.846 --> 41:56.764
(clears throat)

41:58.682 --> 42:00.100
You're right. I just think...

42:04.313 --> 42:07.107
I'm sorry. I'll, uh, I'll do better.

42:08.317 --> 42:11.278
Whether you learn to accept
Henry and me is one thing...

42:11.362 --> 42:12.613
but don't punish your son.

42:13.656 --> 42:15.366
I'll phone him tonight, promise.

42:15.449 --> 42:16.575
(sighs)

42:17.660 --> 42:18.702
You know, Frank,

42:19.578 --> 42:21.956
it wasn't easy for me,
your marriage and everything,

42:22.456 --> 42:23.874
but I knew you were happy,

42:23.958 --> 42:26.544
so I worked very hard
at being happy for you.

42:27.169 --> 42:28.045
I know that.

42:28.629 --> 42:31.382
I guess all I'm asking is,
can you do the same for me?

42:33.842 --> 42:34.843
Yeah, I can.

42:36.011 --> 42:36.929
I will...

42:37.888 --> 42:39.640
but give me a little more time, okay?

42:42.059 --> 42:42.893
Okay.

42:43.477 --> 42:46.480
-(indistinct talking)
-(telephone ringing)

42:46.564 --> 42:49.024
(typewriter clacking)

42:52.194 --> 42:54.738
-Everything okay?
-Everything's clearer.

42:55.447 --> 42:57.491
-Am I gonna see you tonight?
-I'll be late.

42:58.075 --> 42:59.076
I'll wait.

43:02.746 --> 43:03.706
Howard...

43:04.665 --> 43:06.166
hell of a job out there today.

43:09.920 --> 43:11.005
Thank you, Henry.

43:12.339 --> 43:15.175
I'm not sure what kind of a life
I may have saved the woman for,

43:15.259 --> 43:17.428
given her social-economic grouping.

43:19.138 --> 43:20.389
(chuckles)

43:20.472 --> 43:23.976
Still and all,
I guess that's not for us to say.

43:27.479 --> 43:29.940
That was the reason
I advertised in the <i>Gazette,</i>

43:30.024 --> 43:31.358
didn't list it with an agent.

43:31.442 --> 43:34.194
I don't know, Frank. (chuckles)

43:34.903 --> 43:37.615
It's been a cop's home 30 years.

43:38.324 --> 43:40.200
I guess I want to pass it on, you know?

43:40.284 --> 43:42.828
And I appreciate that, Lou. Here's hoping.

43:44.997 --> 43:46.957
Oh, good.
See what Joyce has to say.

43:48.042 --> 43:49.627
-Hi, sweetie.
-Sorry I'm late.

43:49.710 --> 43:53.172
I was just telling your husband,
Mrs. Furillo, whatever it takes.

43:53.255 --> 43:56.634
Sorry, Mr. Fineman,
I can't speak for my husband.

43:56.717 --> 43:59.887
Forgive me, but it's my feeling
we shouldn't take the house.

44:01.764 --> 44:03.307
That-that surprises me.

44:03.766 --> 44:04.683
I'm sorry.

44:05.768 --> 44:08.145
If you could excuse us,
we have a lot to discuss.

44:08.228 --> 44:10.064
If it's in the numbers--

44:10.147 --> 44:12.483
-It isn't.
-Okay.

44:13.275 --> 44:16.445
You want to talk, uh, call anytime.

44:19.365 --> 44:21.325
-Uh...
-Thank you.

44:24.453 --> 44:26.538
(footsteps walking away)

44:29.333 --> 44:30.292
(clears throat)

44:31.794 --> 44:32.753
What's going on?

44:35.673 --> 44:39.134
We don't really need a new place.
The apartment's big enough.

44:39.635 --> 44:41.595
-Well, for now, maybe, but--
-Frank...

44:47.267 --> 44:48.143
I...

44:49.311 --> 44:52.314
I had an appointment
with my doctor this afternoon.

44:52.398 --> 44:55.275
-Is something wrong?
-Yes.

44:55.359 --> 44:57.027
It's a physical problem.

44:58.278 --> 44:59.238
(sighs)

44:59.947 --> 45:01.865
Frank, I can't have children.

45:04.326 --> 45:06.537
Oh, no, Joyce, I'm sorry.

45:11.875 --> 45:13.419
I'm not really hungry.

45:19.007 --> 45:21.885
Why didn't you tell me you were
seeing a doctor about this?

45:21.969 --> 45:25.139
I didn't see any point in upsetting you
without a reason.

45:25.222 --> 45:27.057
We hadn't even discussed kids.

45:27.141 --> 45:29.101
I couldn't put it out of my mind forever.

45:29.184 --> 45:31.854
(indistinct talking on police radio)

45:32.104 --> 45:35.733
The first time I was married,
we tried for a while. It didn't work.

45:37.276 --> 45:39.737
The marriage soured,
so I didn't pursue it.

45:42.030 --> 45:43.741
I always suspected...

45:44.616 --> 45:45.909
something.

45:48.370 --> 45:50.372
I wanted to find out once and for all.

45:52.124 --> 45:53.041
Now we know.

45:54.084 --> 45:56.295
Seems to me you forgot you had a partner.

45:56.378 --> 45:57.880
I don't think that's fair.

45:59.339 --> 46:01.216
I also think that what we're discussing

46:01.300 --> 46:04.011
has nothing to do
with the real reason why you're angry.

46:04.595 --> 46:06.722
-I'm not angry.
-Upset, then.

46:07.681 --> 46:11.185
I think you're upset that your wife
will never be able to have your child.

46:11.935 --> 46:12.770
What are you doing?

46:13.395 --> 46:14.271
Captain Furillo.

46:14.354 --> 46:17.524
Armed robbery in progress
in the 200 block of East Cordova.

46:17.608 --> 46:19.359
-Request backups.
-Frank!

46:19.443 --> 46:21.403
(tires screech)

46:23.238 --> 46:24.406
Don't go in there! Please!

46:25.032 --> 46:26.950
(tires screech)

46:27.034 --> 46:30.120
-He has a gun!
-Please! Please wait for someone!

46:31.747 --> 46:32.790
Police! Drop it!

46:33.290 --> 46:34.583
(gunshot)

46:38.045 --> 46:40.714
(police siren wailing)

47:04.488 --> 47:06.240
We need statements.
There was an employee in the bathroom.

47:06.323 --> 47:08.158
Just get what she heard and let her go.

47:10.702 --> 47:14.081
Uh, Lieutenant,
if there's anything we could defer,

47:14.164 --> 47:16.959
I'd appreciate anything
you could spare me.

47:17.042 --> 47:19.378
Sure. I think we got
about 45 minutes here.

47:19.461 --> 47:20.420
Thank you.

47:31.849 --> 47:33.684
I'm gonna heat some milk. You want some?

47:33.976 --> 47:34.893
No, thanks.

47:43.819 --> 47:44.778
(beeps)

47:47.573 --> 47:50.200
(on answering machine):
<i>Hey, uh, hi, it's Lou Fineman.</i>

47:50.951 --> 47:52.744
<i>Look, I don't want to be a pest,</i>

47:52.828 --> 47:55.247
<i>but if it's about money,</i>
<i>I think we can work it out.</i>

47:56.456 --> 47:59.585
<i>I-I didn't want to say it,</i>
<i>'cause I know it sounds silly.</i>

48:00.711 --> 48:01.712
<i>It's just that...</i>

48:02.713 --> 48:04.631
<i>Well, my wife and I</i>
<i>were happy in this house.</i>

48:04.715 --> 48:06.174
<i>We raised our kids here.</i>

48:06.884 --> 48:09.219
<i>I could see what</i>
<i>a happy couple you two are,</i>

48:09.303 --> 48:12.890
<i>and... I wanted a happy couple</i>
<i>to have our house.</i>

48:12.973 --> 48:13.974
(clicks)

48:22.232 --> 48:25.235
(closing theme playing)
