WEBVTT

00:07.833 --> 00:10.488
all: He loves me,
he loves me not.

00:10.488 --> 00:14.362
He loves me, he loves me not.

00:14.362 --> 00:16.973
Well, does he love you
or love you not?

00:16.973 --> 00:18.018
Who?

00:19.715 --> 00:21.499
The magistrate's son.

00:21.499 --> 00:24.024
As if you don't talk
about William incessantly.

00:24.024 --> 00:25.677
Well?

00:25.677 --> 00:26.635
Uh--

00:29.246 --> 00:31.205
He loves you!

00:31.205 --> 00:34.904
William and Elizabeth
sitting in a tree...

00:34.904 --> 00:38.603
all: K-I-S-S-I-N-G.

00:38.603 --> 00:39.865
Hi, girls.

00:41.867 --> 00:44.435
Come on. Don't want to be
late for the funeral.

00:46.742 --> 00:48.526
I heard William
is gonna be there.

00:53.401 --> 00:55.968
Are they angry with me?

00:55.968 --> 00:58.667
- Uh--
- I didn't do it, I swear.

00:58.667 --> 01:00.147
Do what?

01:04.890 --> 01:06.022
That's a bad omen.

01:06.022 --> 01:07.371
Let's go.

01:07.371 --> 01:09.025
Shoo!

01:14.726 --> 01:15.945
Elizabeth!

01:35.356 --> 01:36.792
Shoo! Shoo!

01:36.792 --> 01:38.663
Away with ye, damned mouser.

01:38.663 --> 01:40.926
This town's had
enough bad luck.

02:02.165 --> 02:03.601
Okay, that should do it.

02:03.601 --> 02:04.602
That's it?

02:04.602 --> 02:05.951
No, that was the easy part.

02:05.951 --> 02:07.475
The hard part was creating
the software patch

02:07.475 --> 02:08.693
to override your quantum chip

02:08.693 --> 02:10.782
without my boss noticing
anything changed.

02:10.782 --> 02:12.523
So from now on,
we'll be able to locate Ben

02:12.523 --> 02:14.438
without leaking
any private data to your boss.

02:14.438 --> 02:15.787
You sure?
- 100%.

02:15.787 --> 02:17.615
Thank you.
I--I feel like I can breathe

02:17.615 --> 02:19.791
for the first time,
and I just--

02:19.791 --> 02:21.445
I--I don't know
what I would have done.

02:21.445 --> 02:24.187
I'm just glad
that you finally came to me.

02:24.187 --> 02:25.406
Okay, I have
to get back to work

02:25.406 --> 02:27.190
and pretend like
none of this happened.

02:27.190 --> 02:29.236
Go help Ben, wherever--

02:29.236 --> 02:30.628
whenever he is.

02:34.066 --> 02:35.459
Whoa.

02:35.459 --> 02:37.461
No, that can't be right.

02:37.461 --> 02:39.246
What can't be right?

02:41.117 --> 02:42.162
Oh.
- What?

02:42.162 --> 02:43.293
What's wrong?

02:43.293 --> 02:46.253
Well, this says
that Ben's in 1692.

02:46.253 --> 02:47.993
That's the furthest back
he's ever leaped.

02:47.993 --> 02:49.212
- Mm-hmm.
- Where is he?

02:49.212 --> 02:50.648
A place called
Middle Towne, Massachusetts.

02:50.648 --> 02:52.998
I've never heard of it.
- Middle Towne?

02:52.998 --> 02:54.130
Can you pull the town records?

02:54.130 --> 02:55.262
Well, considering it's
17th century,

02:55.262 --> 02:56.698
there aren't really
substantial records.

02:56.698 --> 02:59.179
Um, uh, excuse me?

02:59.179 --> 03:00.310
You were the hologram
last time.

03:00.310 --> 03:01.659
It's my turn.

03:01.659 --> 03:02.965
Don't look at me.
I'm not even allowed

03:02.965 --> 03:04.184
in the imaging chamber.

03:05.185 --> 03:06.795
Thank you.

03:06.795 --> 03:08.666
And, uh, you probably won't
find anything on the internet,

03:08.666 --> 03:10.712
so I would start with
the archives in the library.

03:10.712 --> 03:11.930
Okay? Good luck.

03:14.106 --> 03:15.238
Ugh.

03:38.609 --> 03:40.785
I think they're all
talking about you.

03:44.224 --> 03:45.573
Hey.

03:49.316 --> 03:50.926
They're saying
I had something to do

03:50.926 --> 03:53.363
with Josiah's death.

03:53.363 --> 03:55.844
You didn't, right?

03:55.844 --> 03:57.759
Elizabeth.

03:57.759 --> 03:59.456
I loved Josiah.

03:59.456 --> 04:01.153
You don't seriously think
that I would--

04:01.153 --> 04:02.894
No, no, no, of course not.

04:04.548 --> 04:06.289
Don't let them get to you.
It's just gossip, right?

04:06.289 --> 04:07.812
It can't hurt you.

04:10.075 --> 04:11.903
Psst!

04:11.903 --> 04:13.078
Hey!

04:13.078 --> 04:14.602
Ben.

04:17.344 --> 04:18.780
I'll be right back.

04:18.780 --> 04:21.304
I'm gonna go pray.

04:26.048 --> 04:27.702
Hey.
- Oh, my God,

04:27.702 --> 04:28.964
I have been dying
to talk to you.

04:28.964 --> 04:30.313
I mean, Hannah, the kiss--

04:30.313 --> 04:32.010
Yeah, look, I want to,
but talking to you

04:32.010 --> 04:34.317
means talking to everyone
who's listening at HQ, right?

04:34.317 --> 04:36.450
You mean Addison? You know,
you--you can talk to her--

04:36.450 --> 04:37.842
Yeah, I just want to move
forward from this, okay?

04:37.842 --> 04:39.583
- But--
- That part of my life,

04:39.583 --> 04:41.281
I left that part of my life
behind me.

04:41.281 --> 04:42.717
Okay.
We'll focus on the leap.

04:42.717 --> 04:43.935
<i>Great.</i>

04:45.981 --> 04:47.287
So where am I?

04:47.287 --> 04:48.418
It's 1692.

04:48.418 --> 04:49.767
- What?
- I know.

04:49.767 --> 04:51.247
There--there's not exactly
a lot of,

04:51.247 --> 04:53.641
um, historical records
to help you out with this one,

04:53.641 --> 04:55.991
but there is a lot of hot goss
flying around this church.

04:55.991 --> 04:56.948
So what are they saying?

04:56.948 --> 04:58.733
Well, your name is Elizabeth.

04:58.733 --> 05:01.649
You are the servant girl
to Bridget Smith,

05:01.649 --> 05:03.520
who I believe you--
you two already met.

05:03.520 --> 05:04.826
Everyone here calls her Goody.

05:04.826 --> 05:06.393
- Goody?
- It's short for "Goodwife,"

05:06.393 --> 05:10.614
which is, uh--
it's ironic 'cause we are--

05:10.614 --> 05:13.574
we're at her husband's
funeral service.

05:13.574 --> 05:15.619
- Oh.
- But, uh--wait, shh!

05:15.619 --> 05:16.881
Here comes the reverend.

05:19.406 --> 05:23.279
We gather in the wake
of the death of Josiah Smith,

05:23.279 --> 05:26.630
survived
by his young wife, Goody.

05:26.630 --> 05:29.416
First a great drought came
to Middle Towne.

05:29.416 --> 05:30.504
Drought?

05:30.504 --> 05:31.679
People are, ah, complaining

05:31.679 --> 05:32.984
about having
to ration well water.

05:32.984 --> 05:34.159
It's--shh!

05:34.159 --> 05:37.075
Then came
the mysterious affliction.

05:37.075 --> 05:38.381
Affliction?

05:38.381 --> 05:40.122
Whatever killed
Goody's husband

05:40.122 --> 05:43.560
also apparently killed
a farmer and a blacksmith.

05:43.560 --> 05:45.432
- So there's a disease.
- It could be.

05:45.432 --> 05:46.824
I mean, we are
in colonial America.

05:46.824 --> 05:49.479
People died in a lot
of strange ways.

05:49.479 --> 05:51.612
But some people believe

05:51.612 --> 05:54.354
that maybe it is a punishment
for the town.

05:54.354 --> 05:55.659
Like, by God?

05:55.659 --> 05:59.141
And I will punish the world
for their evil.

05:59.141 --> 06:01.186
People are scared,
so they're looking

06:01.186 --> 06:02.927
for someone to blame
for all the bad things

06:02.927 --> 06:04.276
that have been happening
around town.

06:04.276 --> 06:05.669
And they're blaming Goody?

06:05.669 --> 06:07.454
Well, they're saying
that she's a--

06:07.454 --> 06:08.455
What?

06:08.455 --> 06:10.239
Ask yourselves

06:10.239 --> 06:13.590
if <i>he</i> is hiding among us

06:13.590 --> 06:16.767
in this church today.

06:16.767 --> 06:20.510
That is to say, the Devil.

06:22.425 --> 06:24.079
Elizabeth, right?

06:24.079 --> 06:25.689
That is me.

06:25.689 --> 06:27.299
How can I help you...

06:27.299 --> 06:28.388
Magistrate Bloodborne.

06:28.388 --> 06:29.693
Magistrate?

06:29.693 --> 06:31.434
How's your son doing?

06:31.434 --> 06:33.523
Wait, how do you know
he has a son?

06:33.523 --> 06:35.699
William is not well.

06:35.699 --> 06:38.833
He's running a fever
like Josiah before he died.

06:38.833 --> 06:42.445
I brought him to cleanse
with God's word.

06:42.445 --> 06:44.404
I fear the worst
for my William.

06:44.404 --> 06:46.014
There must be something
you can do.

06:46.014 --> 06:48.843
There is one thing
you can help me with,

06:48.843 --> 06:51.672
seeing as you're
Goody's servant girl.

06:51.672 --> 06:57.591
Was Goody behaving unnaturally
before Josiah's death?

06:57.591 --> 06:59.593
Uh, l-like how?

06:59.593 --> 07:01.899
Not like herself.

07:01.899 --> 07:04.554
Maybe she was forgetting things
or sleeping in

07:04.554 --> 07:08.036
or dancing naked in the woods?

07:08.036 --> 07:09.559
I'm sorry, what?

07:09.559 --> 07:10.821
Oh, crap.
Ziggy is saying

07:10.821 --> 07:13.041
that these people burn Goody
at the stake.

07:13.041 --> 07:14.085
What? No.

07:14.085 --> 07:15.783
No, sir.

07:17.349 --> 07:21.615
What you're all blaming
Goody for is not true.

07:21.615 --> 07:24.444
Well, I hope you're right,

07:24.444 --> 07:25.880
because if you're wrong--

07:27.185 --> 07:28.491
- William!
- William!

07:31.102 --> 07:33.104
- He needs water!
- We are in a drought!

07:33.104 --> 07:34.192
He's dying!

07:34.192 --> 07:35.759
Somebody get him some water!

07:35.759 --> 07:37.674
- There's no pulse.
- William is dead.

07:37.674 --> 07:39.415
No, my son.

07:39.415 --> 07:40.851
This is your fault.

07:40.851 --> 07:42.636
- Me?
- You brought these plagues

07:42.636 --> 07:44.594
upon our town!
- We have to do something.

07:44.594 --> 07:46.596
He is in God's hands now.

07:46.596 --> 07:48.772
William died
in the original history,

07:48.772 --> 07:51.427
so there--there isn't much
that you could do.

07:51.427 --> 07:53.385
Wait!

07:59.043 --> 08:00.480
What is
your servant girl doing?

08:00.480 --> 08:01.785
I--

08:01.785 --> 08:03.526
Come on. Come on.

08:13.841 --> 08:15.625
- He's alive!
- He's alive?

08:15.625 --> 08:17.366
William lives!

08:17.366 --> 08:19.194
I did it!

08:20.804 --> 08:23.938
Wh-why is--why is everyone
looking at me like that?

08:23.938 --> 08:27.202
Well, um, fun fact,
CPR hasn't been invented yet.

08:27.202 --> 08:30.118
So they all just saw you bring
someone back from the dead,

08:30.118 --> 08:31.423
which makes you look
a lot like--

08:31.423 --> 08:33.034
Witch!

08:39.170 --> 08:41.651
Please.

08:44.785 --> 08:48.266
Okay, so the good news is
that you did change history

08:48.266 --> 08:51.400
and you saved that boy's life,
but the bad news is,

08:51.400 --> 08:54.098
now it looks like both you
and Goody are going to die.

08:55.143 --> 08:57.580
Citizens of Middle Towne,

08:57.580 --> 09:00.540
what was a whisper
and a rumor is now a fact.

09:00.540 --> 09:02.846
The reason for the drought
and death in this town

09:02.846 --> 09:04.848
and the reason

09:04.848 --> 09:08.765
why we are forced to ration
our well water:

09:08.765 --> 09:09.984
witches!

09:12.987 --> 09:15.990
Our town has always stood
at the crossroads

09:15.990 --> 09:18.166
between Boston and Salem.

09:18.166 --> 09:20.603
We must now put a stake
in the ground...

09:20.603 --> 09:22.474
That's a really unfortunate
choice of words.

09:22.474 --> 09:24.476
To decide what kind of town
Middle Towne will be.

09:24.476 --> 09:26.957
Will we be a town
that submits to evil?

09:26.957 --> 09:28.611
all: Nay!

09:28.611 --> 09:33.485
Or will Middle Towne be
a good, righteous town

09:33.485 --> 09:34.443
like Salem?

09:34.443 --> 09:36.053
all: Aye!

09:36.053 --> 09:38.186
- No!
- Goody came to me in a dream

09:38.186 --> 09:39.448
and told me she's a witch!

09:39.448 --> 09:41.145
Her servant girl was there too!

09:41.145 --> 09:42.190
Okay, h-hold on--

09:42.190 --> 09:43.234
Do you smell sulfur?

09:43.234 --> 09:44.671
I smell sulfur!

09:44.671 --> 09:46.803
'Tis the smell of the Devil!

09:46.803 --> 09:48.762
We shall hold a trial then

09:48.762 --> 09:50.024
to decide their fate.

09:52.156 --> 09:53.984
Please!

09:56.465 --> 09:59.816
I've had just about enough
of your foolishness.

09:59.816 --> 10:02.210
This drought's driven
you all insane,

10:02.210 --> 10:04.038
turning you against
your friends.

10:04.038 --> 10:06.518
You should all be ashamed
of yourselves.

10:06.518 --> 10:07.781
Witches.

10:07.781 --> 10:10.218
Those girls are no more witches
than I am.

10:12.394 --> 10:14.309
Yeah, she shouldn't have
said that.

10:14.309 --> 10:17.225
Witch! Witch! Witch! Witch!

10:18.748 --> 10:19.793
- Witch!
- Witch!

10:19.793 --> 10:21.621
- Witch! Witch!
- Witch!

10:26.060 --> 10:27.975
Ah!

10:27.975 --> 10:29.454
Order!

10:29.454 --> 10:31.195
Quiet!

10:33.328 --> 10:35.199
Hey, Jenn?
Yeah, I'm gonna need you

10:35.199 --> 10:36.679
to hurry back with those books.

10:36.679 --> 10:38.725
Ben's about to be
in a full-blown witch trial.

10:38.725 --> 10:41.684
Uh, I'm not sure
where to begin.

10:41.684 --> 10:43.773
Tell us
how your husband died.

10:43.773 --> 10:46.689
Well, it was just like
how you saw with William.

10:46.689 --> 10:50.737
Josiah, he--
he came down with fever.

10:50.737 --> 10:53.087
It lasted a fortnight.

10:53.087 --> 10:55.263
He--he kept asking for water.

10:55.263 --> 10:57.091
I gave him as much as I could
with the ration,

10:57.091 --> 10:59.049
even gave him my portion.

10:59.049 --> 11:01.443
But his fever only got worse.

11:01.443 --> 11:03.619
I tried to give him tea

11:03.619 --> 11:05.012
I purchased
from the apothecary,

11:05.012 --> 11:08.276
b-but that didn't help either.

11:08.276 --> 11:10.713
He--he died
in my arms the next day.

11:12.759 --> 11:15.457
Did you or did you not

11:15.457 --> 11:17.589
make a deal with the Devil
in exchange

11:17.589 --> 11:19.591
for the soul of this good town?

11:19.591 --> 11:20.767
What?

11:22.116 --> 11:23.291
If you tell us the truth--

11:23.291 --> 11:24.553
- But I--I am!
- She is!

11:24.553 --> 11:27.295
If you confess
to witchcraft and repent,

11:27.295 --> 11:30.037
prayer can save you,
but if you lie,

11:30.037 --> 11:31.778
you will burn at the stake,

11:31.778 --> 11:33.780
and Heaven will decide
your fate.

11:33.780 --> 11:35.956
I thought that
they hanged witches in Salem.

11:35.956 --> 11:38.262
Only fire can cleanse
this kind of evil!

11:38.262 --> 11:40.569
Magistrate Bloodborne,

11:40.569 --> 11:43.137
you officiated our wedding.

11:44.442 --> 11:47.141
I grew up on your farms.

11:47.141 --> 11:50.361
I taught you to jump rope.

11:50.361 --> 11:52.146
We're friends.

11:54.714 --> 11:57.760
I speak the truth.

11:57.760 --> 11:59.370
I'm no witch.

12:04.245 --> 12:06.160
Did it work?

12:06.160 --> 12:07.335
Goody still dies.

12:07.335 --> 12:09.467
Come on, Ben.

12:09.467 --> 12:11.426
Don't let them get away
with this.

12:11.426 --> 12:13.994
Absolutely not.

12:13.994 --> 12:15.343
You deny it then?

12:15.343 --> 12:17.171
Do I deny that I danced
with the Devil?

12:17.171 --> 12:18.433
Are you joking?

12:18.433 --> 12:20.043
Oh, I'm gravely serious.

12:20.043 --> 12:21.392
You don't cover your hair.

12:21.392 --> 12:22.785
You don't attend church.

12:22.785 --> 12:25.309
The flowers in front
of your shop bloom

12:25.309 --> 12:27.398
while the rest of town
suffers in drought.

12:27.398 --> 12:28.660
Because I treat my water
with carbon.

12:28.660 --> 12:29.749
You should try it sometime.

12:29.749 --> 12:31.228
In the testimony
of Goody Smith,

12:31.228 --> 12:32.708
we learned
that you prescribed a brew

12:32.708 --> 12:35.363
to her late husband
not a day before he passed.

12:35.363 --> 12:37.539
It was chamomile
to help him sleep.

12:37.539 --> 12:39.193
Your final answer?

12:39.193 --> 12:42.631
I am not a witch.

12:42.631 --> 12:44.285
- Anything?
- No.

12:44.285 --> 12:45.808
That definitely did not help.

12:45.808 --> 12:47.288
The records now show
Morgan McKenna

12:47.288 --> 12:48.550
on the town's death list.

12:53.033 --> 12:54.861
I've seen this movie.

12:54.861 --> 12:56.166
Didn't like how it ended.

12:56.166 --> 12:58.125
You're back.

12:58.125 --> 12:59.909
Ah.

12:59.909 --> 13:01.258
You look great.

13:01.258 --> 13:02.259
Well.

13:02.259 --> 13:03.565
Where have you been?

13:03.565 --> 13:05.132
We're losing the crowd.
Where's Jenn?

13:05.132 --> 13:07.569
- Is Ben on the stand yet?
- Uh, he's about to be.

13:07.569 --> 13:08.962
Where have you been?
- He has to plead guilty.

13:08.962 --> 13:09.963
What? Why?

13:11.268 --> 13:12.792
My turn.

13:14.315 --> 13:16.578
Hey.

13:16.578 --> 13:18.667
Heard you needed a lawyer.

13:18.667 --> 13:20.800
You're pleading guilty.

13:21.539 --> 13:24.455
The court calls
Elizabeth Bleeker to the stand.

13:24.455 --> 13:26.109
I did some research
on the Salem witch trials

13:26.109 --> 13:28.720
at the library.
Over two dozen people died,

13:28.720 --> 13:30.244
all claiming to be innocent.

13:30.244 --> 13:31.462
But the ones who pled guilty

13:31.462 --> 13:33.943
and confessed to witchcraft
were spared.

13:33.943 --> 13:35.510
Think of it as a plea deal.

13:35.510 --> 13:37.120
You tell them you're all
witches, say you're sorry,

13:37.120 --> 13:38.513
everybody lives, you leap.

13:38.513 --> 13:40.210
Ziggy says it's 80% chance
it'll work.

13:40.210 --> 13:41.777
That's not enough.

13:41.777 --> 13:45.781
If your defense is no good,
then admit your guilt.

13:45.781 --> 13:47.696
What would happen
if I did that?

13:47.696 --> 13:50.046
If you repent,
you may be forgiven.

13:51.308 --> 13:53.006
That's it?

13:53.006 --> 13:54.268
No strings attached?

13:54.268 --> 13:55.878
Well, you can't expect

13:55.878 --> 13:58.533
there won't be consequences
for your crime.

13:58.533 --> 14:01.101
They mean Goody's house,
Morgan's shop,

14:01.101 --> 14:02.885
it'll all be taken away.

14:02.885 --> 14:04.278
No.

14:04.278 --> 14:06.715
Okay, this is
completely unfair.

14:06.715 --> 14:08.760
These women are damned if
they do, damned if they don't.

14:08.760 --> 14:11.459
I agree,
but Ziggy was very clear.

14:11.459 --> 14:13.156
Ben is there to save Goody.

14:13.156 --> 14:15.071
If they all plead guilty,
there's a good chance

14:15.071 --> 14:16.333
Ben saves Goody's life.

14:16.333 --> 14:17.639
And Morgan's and Elizabeth's,

14:17.639 --> 14:19.206
so that's a nice little
three-for-one.

14:19.206 --> 14:21.861
But at what cost?

14:23.253 --> 14:24.472
It's the only way.

14:24.472 --> 14:25.647
- I can't do it.
- Ben.

14:25.647 --> 14:27.562
I refuse to believe I'm here

14:27.562 --> 14:29.694
to convince these women
to lie about who they are.

14:29.694 --> 14:31.914
Then they're gonna die, Ben,
and so will you.

14:31.914 --> 14:34.482
That's what happened
in the original history.

14:34.482 --> 14:35.875
Which I already changed.

14:35.875 --> 14:36.919
Your son!

14:36.919 --> 14:37.920
Sorry?

14:37.920 --> 14:39.052
I call...

14:41.489 --> 14:43.883
William as my witness.

14:47.016 --> 14:48.017
What are you doing?

14:49.453 --> 14:51.020
Can she do that?

14:51.020 --> 14:53.022
Father?

14:53.022 --> 14:54.763
Hold on.

14:54.763 --> 14:57.374
Ziggy says there's a 93% chance
William will help us.

14:57.374 --> 14:58.419
Yes!

15:00.029 --> 15:04.555
Friends--at least
I hope you're my friends,

15:04.555 --> 15:05.992
I once read a quote that said,

15:05.992 --> 15:09.865
"Magic is just science
we don't understand yet."

15:09.865 --> 15:12.694
Saving William's life
wasn't magic.

15:12.694 --> 15:15.523
It was just something
we don't understand yet.

15:15.523 --> 15:17.612
There's nothing
to be scared of.

15:17.612 --> 15:20.484
Right? Tell them, William.

15:20.484 --> 15:22.486
What say you, William?

15:22.486 --> 15:26.012
Is she a witch or no?

15:27.187 --> 15:29.319
She's, uh...

15:32.018 --> 15:34.368
Uh...

15:34.368 --> 15:35.978
well, she's, um...

15:37.632 --> 15:38.676
She's a witch.

15:38.676 --> 15:40.722
- Wait, what?
- I knew it!

15:40.722 --> 15:43.420
Everything went black,
and then there was Elizabeth,

15:43.420 --> 15:44.813
her breath as hot as the Devil.

15:44.813 --> 15:46.032
Okay, come on.
What are you--

15:46.032 --> 15:47.120
wh-what's going on here?

15:47.120 --> 15:48.686
It's just
as the reverend said!

15:48.686 --> 15:50.253
It is just as he said,
and when I woke,

15:50.253 --> 15:51.385
I smelled sulfur.

15:52.908 --> 15:54.083
Witch!

15:55.345 --> 15:57.739
Witch.

15:57.739 --> 16:01.221
Witch! Witch! Witch!

16:01.221 --> 16:03.136
Witch! Witch!

16:03.136 --> 16:05.138
Elizabeth Bleeker,

16:05.138 --> 16:07.749
Morgan McKenna,
and Bridget Goody Smith,

16:07.749 --> 16:10.795
you are hereby
sentenced to death

16:10.795 --> 16:12.754
for the crime of witchcraft!

16:24.026 --> 16:25.723
Thank you very much.

16:25.723 --> 16:26.811
I'm sorry.

16:26.811 --> 16:29.205
I was 93% sure it would work.

16:29.205 --> 16:31.033
That's so weird. I don't know
what happened with Ziggy.

16:31.033 --> 16:32.556
We were doing fine
on our own.

16:32.556 --> 16:34.515
You were about to be
burned at the stake.

16:34.515 --> 16:35.733
- You don't know that.
- No,

16:35.733 --> 16:36.908
that one we're sure about.

16:36.908 --> 16:38.040
I'll figure a way
out of here.

16:38.040 --> 16:39.389
Good luck.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.697
We still have
plenty of time, right?

16:42.697 --> 16:44.873
They're building a pyre
in the town center.

16:44.873 --> 16:46.657
We have until sundown.

16:53.055 --> 16:55.057
It won't work.

16:55.057 --> 16:56.450
Try the walls.

16:59.844 --> 17:00.889
We're underground.

17:00.889 --> 17:03.065
There's no way out.

17:03.065 --> 17:04.110
Why is the wall wet?

17:04.110 --> 17:05.633
We're near the well.

17:05.633 --> 17:06.851
Must be a leak.

17:06.851 --> 17:08.853
I wish this drought had
never come to us.

17:08.853 --> 17:10.768
What if this town
really is cursed?

17:10.768 --> 17:12.292
Oh, please.

17:12.292 --> 17:14.946
The only thing this town
is cursed with is stupidity.

17:14.946 --> 17:17.514
Don't say that.

17:17.514 --> 17:18.950
They're my friends.

17:18.950 --> 17:21.518
They're just scared.

17:21.518 --> 17:23.303
You're defending
those people?

17:23.303 --> 17:24.826
I shouldn't be surprised.

17:24.826 --> 17:25.914
You're one of 'em.

17:25.914 --> 17:26.958
What is that
supposed to mean?

17:26.958 --> 17:28.090
It means you've never had

17:28.090 --> 17:29.439
to think for yourself.

17:29.439 --> 17:31.267
What?

17:31.267 --> 17:34.357
I'm the only one here
who doesn't follow the herd.

17:34.357 --> 17:36.968
Your so-called friends told you
what to believe in

17:36.968 --> 17:38.970
and who to love
and who to hate,

17:38.970 --> 17:40.624
and you never questioned
any of it.

17:40.624 --> 17:43.105
Well, how's it feel now that
they decided to hate you?

17:43.105 --> 17:44.411
All right.

17:44.411 --> 17:46.282
I'll admit, I've heard
the girls talk about you,

17:46.282 --> 17:48.328
but what have I ever done
to you?

17:48.328 --> 17:50.330
I didn't hear you
defending me to the magistrate

17:50.330 --> 17:52.288
after he said my tea
killed your husband.

17:52.288 --> 17:54.986
Hey, hey! This is just
a misunderstanding.

17:54.986 --> 17:56.292
Oh, you're one to talk.

17:56.292 --> 17:58.468
- What?
- I saw you whispering

17:58.468 --> 18:00.296
with the magistrate in church.

18:00.296 --> 18:02.211
For all I know, you're the one
who started this rumor!

18:02.211 --> 18:04.779
I was defending you!

18:04.779 --> 18:07.129
I don't know what
to believe anymore.

18:19.881 --> 18:21.665
Do you smell sulfur?

18:23.841 --> 18:25.626
That's not funny, Elizabeth.

18:25.626 --> 18:27.280
- It's a little bit funny.
- I'm serious.

18:27.280 --> 18:29.717
I--I smell sulfur.

18:32.720 --> 18:35.201
Wait. I smell it too.

18:36.637 --> 18:38.117
Stop it!

18:38.117 --> 18:39.422
Why are you laughing?

18:39.422 --> 18:41.511
'Cause I smell it as well.

18:42.730 --> 18:45.254
There is
a psychological phenomenon

18:45.254 --> 18:47.169
called the power of suggestion.

18:47.169 --> 18:49.650
We might be experiencing
a stress-induced

18:49.650 --> 18:51.739
olfactory hallucination together.

18:51.739 --> 18:54.176
Or we really are witches,

18:54.176 --> 18:55.656
and we just don't know it yet.

19:06.014 --> 19:08.756
Okay, we have till sundown.

19:08.756 --> 19:11.062
What's happening right now?

19:11.062 --> 19:13.195
A séance, apparently.

19:13.195 --> 19:15.284
Ian has
a great-great-great-grandmother

19:15.284 --> 19:16.764
who was accused of being
a witch, so we're hoping

19:16.764 --> 19:18.896
she can point us
in the right direction.

19:18.896 --> 19:20.115
Dorothy?

19:20.115 --> 19:22.204
Dorothy, can you hear us?

19:22.204 --> 19:23.814
We can't hear you.

19:23.814 --> 19:25.164
Sounds like a bad Zoom.

19:25.164 --> 19:27.296
Okay, all right.
This dismissive attitude

19:27.296 --> 19:28.906
is exactly what started
the witch trials

19:28.906 --> 19:30.908
in the first place.
What was it that Ben said?

19:30.908 --> 19:33.389
That magic is just science
that we don't understand yet.

19:33.389 --> 19:37.611
I-I mean, have we learned
nothing since 1692?

19:37.611 --> 19:39.395
Everybody just needs
to stop judging people

19:39.395 --> 19:41.615
for doing things
that they don't understand.

19:42.920 --> 19:43.965
Okay.

19:43.965 --> 19:45.445
What's Grandma Dorothy saying?

19:45.445 --> 19:47.142
Okay, I'm getting a name.

19:47.142 --> 19:49.231
I-I don't know. I lost her.

19:49.231 --> 19:50.798
You scared her away
with your cynicism.

19:54.280 --> 19:55.368
Someone's coming.

20:00.460 --> 20:02.462
Please, we're innocent.

20:02.462 --> 20:04.551
Don't waste your breath
on ol' Sam Welshire.

20:04.551 --> 20:06.466
Terrified of us, he is.
He won't help us.

20:06.466 --> 20:08.598
Welshire.
How do I know that name?

20:08.598 --> 20:11.122
This will be your last meal,
I reckon, so savor it.

20:11.122 --> 20:12.385
Make your peace with God.

20:12.385 --> 20:14.561
Sam! You don't want
our blood on your hands.

20:14.561 --> 20:17.346
We could be your sisters,
your daughters.

20:19.740 --> 20:21.959
'Tis a cruel thing to say
to a man with a barren wife.

20:21.959 --> 20:23.222
That's how I know the name!

20:23.222 --> 20:24.832
Welshire comes up
in Massachusetts records

20:24.832 --> 20:26.660
for years,
starting with his daughter,

20:26.660 --> 20:28.357
Sabrina Welshire.
- Are you sure?

20:28.357 --> 20:30.272
I think I'd know
if my own wife was barren.

20:30.272 --> 20:32.883
He's wrong.
Sabrina was born...

20:32.883 --> 20:34.058
eight months from now.

20:34.058 --> 20:35.451
That means his wife
is already a month

20:35.451 --> 20:37.279
into her pregnancy.
They don't even know yet.

20:37.279 --> 20:39.586
Listen to me, Sam,
you can still

20:39.586 --> 20:41.283
choose to do the right thing.

20:41.283 --> 20:43.720
Saving the lives
of three innocent women

20:43.720 --> 20:46.375
will be your legacy--
and in addition,

20:46.375 --> 20:48.290
you're going to have
a daughter.

20:48.290 --> 20:49.987
Your wife is pregnant.

20:49.987 --> 20:51.946
You know, your wife did
stop by the shop the other day

20:51.946 --> 20:53.817
and bought some ginger root
for nausea.

20:53.817 --> 20:54.949
Yes, that's right.

20:54.949 --> 20:57.473
You can name her Sabrina.

20:57.473 --> 20:59.040
Sabrina.

21:00.781 --> 21:03.262
We've always wanted
to name a child Sabrina.

21:09.529 --> 21:10.965
Do not tempt me, witch.

21:10.965 --> 21:13.489
Magistrate Bloodborne warned
you would try something.

21:13.489 --> 21:16.187
May you burn in Hell for what
you've done to this town.

21:20.627 --> 21:22.411
For a moment,
I thought it would work.

21:22.411 --> 21:23.804
I told her
he wouldn't help us.

21:23.804 --> 21:26.415
I don't know, I think
Sam helped us out plenty.

21:43.693 --> 21:45.826
The sun has set.
We're done for.

21:45.826 --> 21:46.914
They don't know
we're missing yet.

21:46.914 --> 21:48.568
We just have to move fast.

21:48.568 --> 21:50.178
Where can we go?
- How about anywhere

21:50.178 --> 21:51.832
they're not planning
on burning you at the stake?

21:51.832 --> 21:53.050
Boston.
We can disappear there,

21:53.050 --> 21:54.661
start over.
- Boston?

21:54.661 --> 21:56.358
With what money?

21:56.358 --> 21:57.838
We can't risk
stopping by my house.

21:57.838 --> 21:58.969
The magistrate lives next door.

21:58.969 --> 21:59.970
I have enough in my shop

21:59.970 --> 22:01.058
and water for the journey.

22:01.058 --> 22:02.669
Three women traveling alone?

22:02.669 --> 22:04.061
It would take us
all night and a day.

22:04.061 --> 22:05.498
We'd never make it.
- Not if we go by horse.

22:05.498 --> 22:06.890
I have two strong mares.

22:06.890 --> 22:09.632
You get Goody out of town,
you leap.

22:09.632 --> 22:11.460
It's a plan.

22:11.460 --> 22:12.635
Let's go.

22:23.080 --> 22:24.299
I have enough
dried mulberries

22:24.299 --> 22:26.519
and fenugreek seed
to keep the hunger...

22:26.519 --> 22:27.824
at bay.

22:29.260 --> 22:30.827
My shop.

22:30.827 --> 22:32.525
They looted it.

22:32.525 --> 22:34.440
How could they?

22:34.440 --> 22:35.919
Don't you get it, Goody?

22:35.919 --> 22:37.573
I don't have friends
here in Middle Towne,

22:37.573 --> 22:39.358
and now neither do you.

22:46.582 --> 22:47.540
The money's gone.

22:47.540 --> 22:49.237
Of course.

22:51.370 --> 22:52.632
Not to worry.

22:52.632 --> 22:54.024
I have a small amount hidden

22:54.024 --> 22:55.591
in a flowerpot
in the back of the shop.

22:55.591 --> 22:57.550
Collect what you can carry
and meet me back there.

22:57.550 --> 22:59.116
I'll saddle the horses.

23:08.430 --> 23:09.779
Here.

23:11.085 --> 23:12.826
It's just a small setback.

23:12.826 --> 23:14.828
We'll be on our way in no time.

23:27.014 --> 23:29.712
Elizabeth.

23:29.712 --> 23:31.235
How do I look?

23:37.938 --> 23:39.461
No, no, no.

23:40.810 --> 23:43.552
Oh, they took your sister.

23:43.552 --> 23:45.467
Oh, but you can't carry three.

23:52.561 --> 23:54.824
Water.

23:58.045 --> 24:00.221
Charcoal, to clean the water.

24:02.571 --> 24:03.920
How did you know that?

24:03.920 --> 24:05.748
Science.

24:05.748 --> 24:07.358
Magic.

24:11.450 --> 24:13.843
Elizabeth...

24:13.843 --> 24:17.499
how did she know
Sam's wife is pregnant?

24:17.499 --> 24:21.111
There's been something odd
about you.

24:21.111 --> 24:24.071
Even the way you speak
is suddenly different,

24:24.071 --> 24:28.336
more cunning.

24:28.336 --> 24:30.164
Are you a witch?

24:30.164 --> 24:31.339
You can tell me.

24:31.339 --> 24:34.168
I--I promise,
I won't tell anyone.

24:34.168 --> 24:37.563
I thought witches were
frightening old things,

24:37.563 --> 24:40.783
but I'm not scared of you.

24:40.783 --> 24:42.263
Ginger root!
Sam's wife bought

24:42.263 --> 24:43.525
ginger root
from Morgan, remember?

24:43.525 --> 24:45.135
It was the ginger root.

24:45.135 --> 24:47.703
That's how I knew
Sam's wife was pregnant.

24:47.703 --> 24:49.009
I heard it from the girls.

24:49.009 --> 24:51.185
You know, people
in Middle Towne like to talk.

24:51.185 --> 24:52.578
They certainly do.

24:54.188 --> 24:56.625
I want to believe there's some
goodness left in this town,

24:56.625 --> 25:00.324
but what if the fear
has consumed it all?

25:00.324 --> 25:04.546
Like the fever that consumed
my poor Josiah.

25:04.546 --> 25:06.592
I'm sorry.

25:06.592 --> 25:09.856
To lose your person is...

25:14.208 --> 25:16.079
<i>To Hell with it.</i>

25:16.079 --> 25:18.386
We are leaving it all behind.

25:21.389 --> 25:24.871
Uh, Ben, I don't think
you're going anywhere.

25:32.705 --> 25:35.011
She left us?

25:35.011 --> 25:36.578
We're done for.

25:39.625 --> 25:41.017
The witches have escaped!

25:46.588 --> 25:48.068
We're trapped.

25:48.068 --> 25:49.591
We'll find a way.

25:56.816 --> 25:58.600
Ben, someone's coming.

25:58.600 --> 26:00.602
Come on, hide over here.

26:13.006 --> 26:14.355
William?

26:14.355 --> 26:15.704
Shh!

26:17.445 --> 26:18.577
Follow me.

26:18.577 --> 26:21.623
I've found a way
to get you out of town.

26:21.623 --> 26:23.016
Hurry.

26:30.719 --> 26:31.807
That is enough
to get them to Boston.

26:31.807 --> 26:33.548
You leave in five minutes.

26:36.464 --> 26:38.074
- You all right?
- Yeah.

26:38.074 --> 26:40.033
Here.

26:40.033 --> 26:41.991
93% chance he was
gonna help you.

26:41.991 --> 26:44.341
I'll be damned.
Ziggy was right.

26:44.341 --> 26:45.734
Thank you.

26:45.734 --> 26:48.084
We know what you're risking
by doing this.

26:48.084 --> 26:49.651
You saved my life.

26:49.651 --> 26:51.435
I saved yours.

26:51.435 --> 26:52.567
We're even.

26:52.567 --> 26:54.917
William, wait.

26:54.917 --> 26:57.441
I know your life
is none of my business.

26:57.441 --> 26:58.660
Here we go.

26:58.660 --> 27:02.403
But I've sort of
made it my business.

27:02.403 --> 27:03.752
You can't keep living
like this,

27:03.752 --> 27:06.363
scared of your dad.

27:06.363 --> 27:07.713
Talk to him.

27:07.713 --> 27:10.933
Tell them how you really feel
about things.

27:12.805 --> 27:14.633
- Over here!
- Over here!

27:14.633 --> 27:17.070
Get down.

27:24.077 --> 27:26.383
William?

27:26.383 --> 27:28.255
William.

27:28.255 --> 27:30.474
What are you doing here?
You should be home resting.

27:30.474 --> 27:34.217
I, uh, fancied an apple.

27:34.217 --> 27:35.828
Forgive me.

28:04.770 --> 28:06.467
Forgot your apple.

28:06.467 --> 28:08.208
Let's go.

28:12.081 --> 28:13.387
Hey, Ben's safe.

28:13.387 --> 28:14.736
He should be leaping soon.

28:14.736 --> 28:15.911
- Good.
- Yeah.

28:15.911 --> 28:19.436
And I did absolutely nothing
to help.

28:27.096 --> 28:29.925
Magic...

28:29.925 --> 28:32.667
I went from being the leaper

28:32.667 --> 28:35.322
to being a hologram

28:35.322 --> 28:40.806
to basically being
our worst intern ever.

28:42.068 --> 28:44.374
Well, certainly not
the worst.

28:44.374 --> 28:46.550
Remember Jeffrey in R&D?

28:49.510 --> 28:51.381
I know you didn't
sign up for this.

28:51.381 --> 28:52.948
And there's nothing I want more

28:52.948 --> 28:54.820
than to see you back
in that imaging chamber--

28:54.820 --> 28:57.213
Yeah, well,
Ben made his choice.

28:59.738 --> 29:01.827
And I have to respect that.

29:03.785 --> 29:06.353
I've always found it hard

29:06.353 --> 29:10.531
to accept that some people,
some things,

29:10.531 --> 29:12.794
we can't change.

29:12.794 --> 29:15.231
You asked me where I went
on my day off.

29:15.231 --> 29:17.973
I met with my sponsor.

29:17.973 --> 29:20.236
I--

29:20.236 --> 29:22.717
Magic.
- Yeah.

29:22.717 --> 29:24.066
That's great.

29:24.066 --> 29:28.810
Well, we went
to the park and talked.

29:28.810 --> 29:33.946
It's remarkable
how community can lift you up,

29:33.946 --> 29:38.124
or in the case of that
little town Ben visited,

29:38.124 --> 29:39.299
tear you down.

29:39.299 --> 29:42.128
Can I ask
what you talked about?

29:42.128 --> 29:44.391
Alchemy.

29:44.391 --> 29:45.958
- Alchemy?
- Mm.

29:45.958 --> 29:48.308
Like magically turning
metals into gold?

29:48.308 --> 29:52.660
Like turning a bad situation
into a good one.

29:52.660 --> 29:55.141
Okay.

29:55.141 --> 29:56.316
How do I do that?

29:58.144 --> 30:02.061
You focus on the things
you can change.

30:02.061 --> 30:03.453
Look, you don't have
any control

30:03.453 --> 30:05.281
over what Ben decides to do,

30:05.281 --> 30:09.808
but you always have a say
over who you're going to be,

30:09.808 --> 30:13.115
how much grace you choose
to have for him,

30:13.115 --> 30:17.163
how much patience,
how much love.

30:17.163 --> 30:20.993
When you realize the power
you have over yourself,

30:20.993 --> 30:25.954
that's when you transmute
a bad situation into gold,

30:25.954 --> 30:31.873
which, in a way,
is a kind of magic.

30:38.227 --> 30:42.318
So what are you gonna do
in Boston?

30:42.318 --> 30:44.059
I don't know.

30:44.059 --> 30:47.149
My parents died
before they could take me.

30:47.149 --> 30:49.151
I've only ever known
this place,

30:49.151 --> 30:53.155
its quiet roads,
its little church,

30:53.155 --> 30:55.897
its big fields where I lay out
with the girls in summertime,

30:55.897 --> 31:00.249
singing lazy songs
and eating so many dewberries

31:00.249 --> 31:02.425
our hands stain red.

31:02.425 --> 31:05.515
You don't want to leave.

31:05.515 --> 31:08.344
What choice do I have?

31:08.344 --> 31:11.260
Everyone has turned
their back on me,

31:11.260 --> 31:12.871
even Morgan.

31:14.307 --> 31:16.091
Ben, stop! Stop!

31:16.091 --> 31:17.701
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Stop, stop, stop!

31:17.701 --> 31:18.746
- What?
- Whoa, whoa.

31:18.746 --> 31:20.008
Why? Why are we stopping?

31:20.008 --> 31:21.183
Ziggy says you get Goody

31:21.183 --> 31:23.185
to that crossroads
and you leap.

31:26.362 --> 31:28.321
That's coming
from Middle Towne.

31:28.321 --> 31:29.452
They caught Morgan.

31:29.452 --> 31:30.932
- No.
- I'm sorry, Ben.

31:30.932 --> 31:32.020
They cut her off in the woods.

31:32.020 --> 31:33.717
Can you hear
what they're saying?

31:33.717 --> 31:35.371
They have Morgan.

31:35.371 --> 31:37.156
Come on.

31:37.156 --> 31:39.767
We have to stop them. Come on!

31:41.247 --> 31:44.903
Hey, what--what are you doing?

31:44.903 --> 31:47.383
I'm going to Boston.

31:47.383 --> 31:49.559
Look, this is your home,
and Morgan needs your help--

31:49.559 --> 31:52.954
Morgan didn't think twice
leaving us to our deaths!

31:54.390 --> 31:58.351
I am abandoned by my husband,
my friends!

31:58.351 --> 32:01.006
There's nothing left
for me here!

32:02.616 --> 32:06.359
I am taking my broken heart
as far away from this place

32:06.359 --> 32:08.100
as my feet will carry it.

32:10.319 --> 32:12.278
You're not here
for Morgan, Ben.

32:12.278 --> 32:14.062
You're here to save
Goody's life.

32:14.062 --> 32:16.195
But what about your soul?

32:16.195 --> 32:18.240
You sound like
the magistrate.

32:18.240 --> 32:20.025
I can't watch you ride away

32:20.025 --> 32:21.374
from here bitter
and full of hate.

32:21.374 --> 32:22.941
I've been down
that road, Goody.

32:22.941 --> 32:24.246
It's a dead end.

32:24.246 --> 32:25.769
If you leave now,

32:25.769 --> 32:28.424
they're gonna kill Morgan
and who knows how many others.

32:28.424 --> 32:32.211
She hurt you.
She turned her back on you.

32:32.211 --> 32:35.388
But that doesn't mean you have
to turn your back on her.

32:35.388 --> 32:37.956
Look, you're at
a literal crossroads!

32:39.696 --> 32:43.874
So what's it gonna be?

32:51.926 --> 32:53.667
I'm assuming you have a plan.

32:53.667 --> 32:56.844
Not exactly, but I will
by the time we get there.

33:04.895 --> 33:06.810
Burn her!

33:06.810 --> 33:08.595
Burn them all!

33:08.595 --> 33:11.772
You do have a plan, right?

33:11.772 --> 33:12.686
Mm-hmm.

33:12.686 --> 33:14.688
I don't see Morgan.

33:14.688 --> 33:16.733
I'm getting a better look.

33:16.733 --> 33:18.953
How did this happen? He was
moments away from leaping.

33:18.953 --> 33:20.476
He was until he wasn't.

33:20.476 --> 33:22.174
How you ever keep him
on mission is beyond me.

33:22.174 --> 33:24.176
- Okay, what do we have?
- Well, it's right around dawn

33:24.176 --> 33:25.742
on this day in 1692, right?

33:25.742 --> 33:27.614
I'm sorry, is that
an astrology book?

33:27.614 --> 33:30.486
Yeah, looks like Mars
was retrograde in Gemini,

33:30.486 --> 33:32.532
which means that Ben should
lean into communication.

33:32.532 --> 33:33.837
Or maybe he should
avoid communication--

33:33.837 --> 33:35.404
We don't have time
for this nonsense, Ian.

33:35.404 --> 33:37.058
I'm sorry, but there are
a lot of planets, okay, Jenn?

33:37.058 --> 33:39.582
We have a full moon,
and Saturn is square Neptune,

33:39.582 --> 33:41.410
which--which explains
the sudden rain.

33:41.410 --> 33:42.803
But that doesn't really
help us with Ben.

33:42.803 --> 33:44.631
Wait, did you just say rain?

33:44.631 --> 33:46.415
Yeah, I--I cross-referenced
these star charts

33:46.415 --> 33:47.764
with this old
"Farmer's Almanac,"

33:47.764 --> 33:49.462
and it may have rained
at some point after dawn,

33:49.462 --> 33:50.724
which is in a few minutes.

33:50.724 --> 33:52.030
Where are you going
with this?

33:52.030 --> 33:54.162
Okay, uh, you need
to tell Ben that there's

33:54.162 --> 33:56.077
a 50/50 chance it's about
to rain, and he needs to--

33:56.077 --> 33:57.861
No, I don't understand
any of this stuff!

33:57.861 --> 33:59.646
You tell him.
- He does not want to see me.

33:59.646 --> 34:01.126
I think between
talking to his ex

34:01.126 --> 34:02.518
and burning at the stake,

34:02.518 --> 34:05.086
he's gonna choose
talking to his ex.

34:07.219 --> 34:08.872
Hey.

34:10.352 --> 34:11.875
- Hi.
- I'm sorry.

34:11.875 --> 34:14.226
I know that you said--
- No, it's totally--

34:14.226 --> 34:16.010
Good, 'cause I have a plan.

34:16.010 --> 34:16.967
Oh, thank God.

34:16.967 --> 34:18.317
Ian says it's about to rain--

34:18.317 --> 34:19.361
any minute.

34:19.361 --> 34:20.841
There's been a drought, so...

34:20.841 --> 34:22.886
And the townspeople have
no idea it's about to end.

34:22.886 --> 34:24.584
That's brilliant.
You're brilliant.

34:24.584 --> 34:26.238
Do we know the exact time?
- We don't.

34:26.238 --> 34:29.154
So you're kind of gonna have
to rely on God's grace.

34:29.154 --> 34:31.939
Help!
- Witch!

34:31.939 --> 34:33.114
- Witch!
- Witch!

34:33.114 --> 34:34.550
- I'm going in.
- Wait, you're just--

34:34.550 --> 34:35.551
you're just going in?

34:35.551 --> 34:37.118
Wait, what are you--

34:37.118 --> 34:39.599
God's grace, right?

34:39.599 --> 34:41.949
It wasn't me, I swear it!

34:41.949 --> 34:43.777
I didn't do it.
all: Witch! Witch!

34:43.777 --> 34:45.213
I didn't do it.
all: Witch!

34:47.911 --> 34:49.087
No!

34:49.087 --> 34:50.175
Please!

34:50.175 --> 34:52.438
Stop! Stop!

34:52.438 --> 34:53.917
Stop!

34:53.917 --> 34:55.005
There she is!

35:00.489 --> 35:02.883
You came back for me.

35:02.883 --> 35:05.015
You have a friend
in Middle Towne yet.

35:06.800 --> 35:09.150
What are you waiting for?
Seize them!

35:10.978 --> 35:12.762
No! No!

35:14.808 --> 35:16.549
William, what is
the meaning of this?

35:16.549 --> 35:18.725
Let her speak.

35:18.725 --> 35:20.640
I would like to hear
what she has to say,

35:20.640 --> 35:23.425
as I'm sure we all would,

35:23.425 --> 35:25.993
had I not been a coward
in the court.

35:27.429 --> 35:29.431
Go on then.

35:29.431 --> 35:31.868
Everyone is entitled
to their last words.

35:31.868 --> 35:33.043
Thank you.

35:33.043 --> 35:36.438
And I, uh, hope
they won't be my last.

35:38.527 --> 35:42.052
There's an affliction
in this town.

35:42.052 --> 35:44.533
And it's called fear.

35:44.533 --> 35:46.361
And I get it.

35:46.361 --> 35:47.884
You have no water.

35:47.884 --> 35:49.190
Your friends are all sick.

35:49.190 --> 35:51.410
You're scared.

35:51.410 --> 35:54.369
But this,
this is not who you are.

35:54.369 --> 35:56.719
We have decided
your fate, witch.

35:56.719 --> 35:58.591
Well, then I say nay!

35:58.591 --> 36:00.723
I say let Heaven
decide our fate.

36:00.723 --> 36:03.117
Speak plainly!

36:03.117 --> 36:07.426
Well, if God wants us
to burn at the stake, so be it.

36:07.426 --> 36:09.602
But if not,

36:09.602 --> 36:11.778
let it rain!

36:18.350 --> 36:19.786
Come on.

36:21.266 --> 36:23.659
Let it rain!

36:26.271 --> 36:29.491
Come on.

36:32.320 --> 36:34.975
Let it rain!

36:34.975 --> 36:38.108
We're in a drought,
you daft girl!

36:38.108 --> 36:39.675
You will not harm my son

36:39.675 --> 36:42.069
or any other good person
in Middle Towne.

36:42.069 --> 36:44.463
You wanted Heaven
to decide your fate,

36:44.463 --> 36:45.812
well, you got it, witch.

36:45.812 --> 36:47.596
I will throw you
onto the fire myself.

37:11.054 --> 37:14.275
"Then will I sprinkle
clean water upon you,

37:14.275 --> 37:16.234
and ye shall be clean!"

37:19.062 --> 37:21.064
Thank God!

37:36.036 --> 37:37.298
It worked.

37:37.298 --> 37:38.604
Your nonsense worked.

37:42.738 --> 37:45.567
What does this mean?

37:45.567 --> 37:49.528
It means you were wrong.

37:49.528 --> 37:51.225
The magistrate was wrong!

37:51.225 --> 37:52.357
He has misled us!

37:52.357 --> 37:53.706
He should be punished!

37:53.706 --> 37:55.534
Burn him!

37:55.534 --> 37:56.970
No, no, no!

37:56.970 --> 37:59.320
Okay, no more burning people!

37:59.320 --> 38:00.669
Okay?

38:00.669 --> 38:02.889
You need to figure
something else out.

38:02.889 --> 38:06.240
Magistrate Bloodborne was right
about one thing.

38:06.240 --> 38:10.766
You need to decide what kind
of town you're going to be.

38:10.766 --> 38:14.335
The kind of town
where you talk <i>about</i> others

38:14.335 --> 38:16.032
or talk <i>to</i> others?

38:16.032 --> 38:18.121
The kind of town
where you burn witches

38:18.121 --> 38:22.561
or build something beautiful
together?

38:22.561 --> 38:25.868
Okay, seriously, am I the only
one who still smells sulfur?

38:25.868 --> 38:27.174
Is--does anyone else
smell that?

38:27.174 --> 38:29.307
- I smell it.
- So I'm not imagining things?

38:29.307 --> 38:30.612
Okay.

38:31.961 --> 38:33.702
Is this--is it coming from--

38:37.097 --> 38:38.272
Ugh.

38:40.535 --> 38:42.407
Your well has sulfur in it.

38:42.407 --> 38:45.758
Dehydration, fever--

38:45.758 --> 38:47.760
the drought must have
caused stagnation

38:47.760 --> 38:49.327
in your water supply.

38:49.327 --> 38:51.111
The well is contaminated!

38:51.111 --> 38:53.592
That's why everyone's
been getting sick.

38:53.592 --> 38:55.071
It's not witchcraft.

38:55.071 --> 38:58.945
There is hydrogen sulfide
in your water supply.

39:01.513 --> 39:04.429
Will this clean it?

39:04.429 --> 39:07.127
Charcoal, right?

39:07.127 --> 39:08.607
Right.

39:17.703 --> 39:19.226
The big ones!

39:19.226 --> 39:21.359
Grab the big ones.

39:22.838 --> 39:25.188
I should go help them.

39:26.451 --> 39:29.715
Hey, so, um...

39:29.715 --> 39:31.847
fare thee well, Goody.

39:31.847 --> 39:35.155
I'll be just
across the square.

39:35.155 --> 39:36.417
Come on, William.

39:36.417 --> 39:38.201
Lend us a hand.

39:44.338 --> 39:45.426
Well, it's, uh--

39:45.426 --> 39:46.949
it's nice to see
that you've moved on.

39:46.949 --> 39:48.168
- Okay.
- Yeah.

39:49.735 --> 39:52.390
Um, well,

39:52.390 --> 39:55.175
their names are no longer
on the death list

39:55.175 --> 39:57.830
because there is
no more death list.

39:57.830 --> 39:59.440
- Yes!
- No witches were burned

39:59.440 --> 40:02.356
or hanged in Middle Towne.

40:02.356 --> 40:06.316
And unfortunately, that is all
the information that I have.

40:06.316 --> 40:08.449
I have a feeling
they're gonna be okay.

40:11.452 --> 40:14.673
Hey, so, uh, about us--

40:14.673 --> 40:17.806
Look, I already know.

40:17.806 --> 40:20.113
You don't know everything
I'm about to say.

40:20.113 --> 40:22.376
Okay, so you weren't
about to say

40:22.376 --> 40:25.597
that this is still
complicated and messy

40:25.597 --> 40:27.381
and that you need more time?

40:27.381 --> 40:28.687
Yeah, okay,
that's what I was gonna say.

40:28.687 --> 40:30.906
Yeah.

40:30.906 --> 40:32.255
I'm scared.

40:32.255 --> 40:35.389
That's why I didn't want
to work with you anymore.

40:35.389 --> 40:40.002
I'm scared of what
it might do to me.

40:40.002 --> 40:42.048
But now I'm more scared

40:42.048 --> 40:45.094
of what shutting you out
might do to me.

40:45.094 --> 40:47.880
I don't want to be
that bitter, angry guy

40:47.880 --> 40:50.404
who can't talk to his ex.

40:50.404 --> 40:52.319
And I don't know what
navigating a friendship

40:52.319 --> 40:56.497
with you is like,
but I guess, um,

40:56.497 --> 40:57.890
what I'm trying to say is,

40:57.890 --> 41:01.850
if you feel like
you want to try,

41:01.850 --> 41:04.679
will you be my hologram?

41:24.307 --> 41:25.831
What the...

41:27.615 --> 41:31.619
Toto, I have a feeling
we're not in Kansas anymore.
