WEBVTT

00:20.934 --> 00:22.731
What's goin' on?

00:22.803 --> 00:25.135
It's our Russian team
on the International Space Station.

00:25.205 --> 00:27.696
They're adjusting the orbit
to avoid some debris...

00:27.774 --> 00:30.504
left over from
our little incident in Antarctica.

01:03.910 --> 01:05.104
It worked.

01:19.092 --> 01:22.528
He said, "If the Americans wanna keep
blasting alien ships out of orbit...

01:22.596 --> 01:25.656
they've gotta do a better job of
tracking their own mess."

01:36.343 --> 01:39.972
- What's going on?
- I don't know. We lost contact.

03:08.268 --> 03:09.360
Come in.

03:15.575 --> 03:17.236
General O'Neill.

03:17.310 --> 03:20.245
It is an honor to meet you,
and may I say an even greater honor...

03:20.313 --> 03:22.008
to finally serve
under your command.

03:22.082 --> 03:24.175
Wow. That was a load.

03:26.786 --> 03:28.014
Who are you?

03:29.589 --> 03:32.490
I am Colonel Alexi Vaselov, sir.

03:32.559 --> 03:34.823
I assumed you were
expecting my arrival.

03:36.329 --> 03:37.591
Yeah.

03:37.664 --> 03:39.154
Sure.

03:40.834 --> 03:44.031
Yeah. Here's the memo.
Right there.

03:44.104 --> 03:47.835
I want you to know, sir, that
I personally requested this transfer.

03:48.675 --> 03:51.542
After my many years of service
with Russian Air Force...

03:51.611 --> 03:54.876
I feel confident I can make a positive
contribution to Stargate Command.

03:57.183 --> 03:58.411
Great.

04:00.854 --> 04:02.947
If I may be so bold, sir...

04:03.623 --> 04:07.286
I understand that with your recent
appointment as base commander...

04:07.360 --> 04:10.124
a position has become
available on SG-1.

04:11.431 --> 04:15.265
I would of course relish the opportunity
to serve on the SGC's elite team.

04:15.335 --> 04:19.396
Yes. You and everyone else
on this base.

04:23.777 --> 04:26.143
Colonel, not gonna happen.

04:27.080 --> 04:29.605
I understand your reluctance, sir...

04:29.683 --> 04:33.949
but if you look at my record, I think
it will satisfy any of your concerns.

04:34.020 --> 04:38.457
I have over 3,000 flight hours on more
than 35 types of aircraft and prototypes.

04:38.525 --> 04:42.484
In addition, I have been awarded the
High Order of Russia, the Gold Star and-

04:42.562 --> 04:45.531
Yes, yes. Very impressive.

04:45.599 --> 04:49.365
Very. But it's not gonna
get you on SG-1.

04:52.872 --> 04:54.533
Understood.

04:54.608 --> 04:58.135
I am of course willing to accept
a position on a different team.

04:58.211 --> 04:59.542
Colonel...

05:00.213 --> 05:03.046
until you go through
the proper training...

05:03.116 --> 05:05.550
you're not goin'
anywhere near that gate.

05:08.288 --> 05:10.813
Perhaps I could assume a role
as a noncombat observer...

05:10.890 --> 05:12.824
on one of the exploration units, sir.

05:12.892 --> 05:16.191
It was nice meeting you.
Very nice.

05:18.198 --> 05:19.688
You're dismissed.

05:36.282 --> 05:39.376
If all goes according to plan, barring
any unforeseen circumstance...

05:39.452 --> 05:41.886
I will acquire possession
of my apartment on Tuesday.

05:42.889 --> 05:46.120
- Hey. Congratulations.
- So when's the apartment-warming party?

05:49.095 --> 05:52.622
When someone gets a new place it's
customary for them to throw a party.

05:53.700 --> 05:55.793
Would I be required
to prepare a meal?

05:55.869 --> 05:57.996
No. Make it potluck.
We'll all bring something.

05:59.072 --> 06:01.370
Very well.
Next Saturday.

06:07.380 --> 06:09.314
I'm only gonna say this once, Carter.

06:09.382 --> 06:10.542
At ease.

06:13.119 --> 06:14.814
So how's the new job?

06:15.889 --> 06:18.050
One crisis after another.

06:18.758 --> 06:21.352
This morning the mess got a shipment
of Yukon Gold potatoes...

06:21.428 --> 06:23.362
instead of the usual russets.

06:24.230 --> 06:25.857
Oh, yes.

06:25.932 --> 06:29.060
The Golds don't make for good mash.
Consistency's all wrong.

06:32.105 --> 06:36.872
I hear the new Russian colonel came
to see you, made a pitch to join SG-1.

06:36.943 --> 06:39.241
- Yeah.
- What'd you say?

06:39.312 --> 06:42.247
- Told 'em to make french fries instead.
- About the Russian.

06:43.783 --> 06:46.274
I made it clear he shouldn't expect
preferential treatment...

06:46.352 --> 06:50.015
that he'd have to prove himself before
I'd consider him for off-world travel.

06:50.090 --> 06:53.924
He is one of the most highly decorated
officers in Russian military history...

06:53.993 --> 06:56.018
and he has over
<i>20 years' flight experience.</i>

06:56.096 --> 06:59.224
And exactly no years
in off-world travel.

06:59.299 --> 07:03.099
I'm not gonna risk the lives of anyone
under my command on a slick résumé.

07:05.205 --> 07:07.901
How uncharacteristically
cautious of you, sir.

07:07.974 --> 07:10.306
Yes. There's that.

07:10.376 --> 07:13.607
Also, the Russians must be pressuring you
to put him on the team.

07:13.680 --> 07:15.614
Yes. There's that too.

07:15.682 --> 07:18.549
You can't blame them. We haven't
been making good on our promises.

07:18.618 --> 07:21.212
- We gave them their own team.
- That was two years ago.

07:21.287 --> 07:23.915
- What have we done for them lately?
- Forget it.

07:23.990 --> 07:25.958
I'm not putting him on SG-1.

07:26.025 --> 07:28.084
Do you have someone else
in mind, O'Neill?

07:31.364 --> 07:33.730
- We're sticking with the three-man team?
- Why not?

07:33.800 --> 07:35.768
It's one less decision
I have to deal with.

07:35.835 --> 07:39.931
There's nothing that says an SG team
has to be made up of four people.

07:42.008 --> 07:44.408
There you go.
Problem solved.

07:47.847 --> 07:49.337
Thank you.

08:25.885 --> 08:29.150
- Colonel Vaselov.
- Dr. Jackson. Of course.

08:29.222 --> 08:30.712
Come in.

08:32.826 --> 08:35.294
Your reputation precedes you.

08:35.361 --> 08:37.795
I'm well acquainted
with your work.

08:37.864 --> 08:40.992
I just wanted to come by
and welcome you to the neighborhood.

08:41.067 --> 08:43.035
That's very kind of you.

08:43.102 --> 08:45.866
I only wish others were
as open to my presence here.

08:45.939 --> 08:49.898
Yeah. Don't take General O'Neill's
decision personally.

08:51.511 --> 08:55.743
It's difficult not to.
Frankly, his attitude is offensive.

08:55.815 --> 08:58.249
It leads me to wonder
if he knows the Cold war is over.

08:58.318 --> 09:00.718
His attitude has nothing to do
with your being Russian.

09:00.787 --> 09:02.721
He's an equal opportunity offender.

09:03.723 --> 09:05.714
And I am supposed to
find this comforting?

09:07.460 --> 09:09.519
He doesn't respond well
to outside pressure.

09:09.596 --> 09:12.895
Our nations are supposed to be
partners in the Stargate program.

09:12.966 --> 09:15.196
I'm well aware of the deal.
I helped broker it.

09:15.268 --> 09:18.032
Then you more than anyone
can understand our frustration.

09:18.104 --> 09:20.902
Okay.
What you have to realize is...

09:21.674 --> 09:22.902
Colonel O'Neill-

09:22.976 --> 09:26.537
General O'Neill just assumed
command of this facility...

09:26.613 --> 09:28.547
and he's got a lot on his plate.

09:28.615 --> 09:30.640
Quite frankly,
making demands on him right now...

09:30.717 --> 09:32.947
is just bad timing
on the part of your government.

09:35.321 --> 09:36.413
Colonel?

09:39.525 --> 09:41.015
Colonel?

09:58.945 --> 10:00.378
What happened?

10:00.446 --> 10:03.438
I don't know. We were talking,
and all of a sudden he collapsed.

10:03.516 --> 10:06.610
All right. I know you're scheduled
to go off-world. We'll take care of him.

10:33.913 --> 10:36.473
- How's he doin'?
- Confused.

10:36.549 --> 10:39.484
Apparently the last thing
he remembers is being in Russia.

10:39.552 --> 10:41.986
He doesn't know where he is
or how he got here.

10:42.055 --> 10:45.320
He's also exhibiting certain physical
symptoms which have me concerned.

10:45.391 --> 10:48.656
He has lesions over 40% of his body and
a highly elevated white blood count...

10:48.728 --> 10:50.662
which indicates
some sort of infection.

10:52.432 --> 10:53.922
Is he contagious?

10:55.001 --> 10:57.060
It's a distinct possibility.

10:57.136 --> 11:00.628
Sir, we need to examine everyone
who's been in contact with this man.

11:25.298 --> 11:27.289
Report back to the infirmary.

11:32.205 --> 11:33.297
Open the gate!

11:34.741 --> 11:36.003
Do it now!

12:28.428 --> 12:32.023
He's lost a lot of blood, but his life
is no longer in any immediate danger.

12:32.732 --> 12:35.428
The members of SG-11
insisted he seemed perfectly normal.

12:36.669 --> 12:39.069
Did you notice anything
peculiar about him, sir?

12:40.973 --> 12:43.703
I thought it odd he was
shooting up the gate room.

12:43.776 --> 12:46.074
He reacted immediately
after the gate was shut down.

12:46.145 --> 12:47.908
Why was he so desperate
to go through?

12:49.782 --> 12:51.807
Does he have any of
Colonel Vaselov's symptoms?

12:52.919 --> 12:55.444
No lesions yet,
but that may just be a matter of time.

12:55.521 --> 12:57.546
He does have an elevated
white blood count.

12:57.623 --> 13:00.057
Yet Colonel Vaselov displayed
no unusual behavior.

13:00.126 --> 13:03.562
That doesn't necessarily mean they're
not suffering from the same condition.

13:03.629 --> 13:07.395
If an infection reaches the brain, it can
manifest itself in a variety of ways...

13:07.467 --> 13:09.935
from memory loss
to full-blown psychosis.

13:10.002 --> 13:11.936
You don't think
it's a coincidence.

13:12.004 --> 13:13.938
Seems unlikely, sir.

13:14.006 --> 13:17.271
I think there's a high probability
that we have a contagion on the base.

13:26.686 --> 13:28.711
Contact all teams
that are off-world.

13:29.388 --> 13:31.413
Tell them the SGC is off-limits.

13:32.992 --> 13:35.517
Have them proceed
to the Alpha Site until further notice.

13:36.195 --> 13:39.687
Effective immediately,
the SGC is under lockdown.

13:55.214 --> 13:57.148
Hi. How's Daniel?

13:57.216 --> 13:59.480
He's still unconscious,
but he's improving.

13:59.552 --> 14:02.953
He's responding well to treatment,
and his white cell count is coming down.

14:03.022 --> 14:05.855
- What about Colonel Vaselov?
- He's not so good.

14:05.925 --> 14:09.588
We're treating him with antibiotics,
but his condition is deteriorating.

14:09.662 --> 14:13.564
Until we know more about the source of
the infection, there's not much we can do.

14:13.633 --> 14:17.296
Since it started with Vaselov, we can be
sure it didn't come through the gate.

14:17.370 --> 14:19.361
I'm waiting to hear back
from the Russians...

14:19.438 --> 14:21.770
about possible sources
of the infection from their end.

14:21.841 --> 14:24.173
- Anyone else showing symptoms?
- Not yet.

14:39.392 --> 14:41.155
How is he?

14:41.827 --> 14:43.317
Dr. Jackson.

14:44.997 --> 14:47.090
Dr. Brightman told me
what happened.

14:49.135 --> 14:51.069
His condition is improving.

14:52.538 --> 14:53.766
Good.

14:53.839 --> 14:55.670
And your condition?

14:57.343 --> 14:59.277
Not so good.

15:00.012 --> 15:04.949
But not so bad as the time I went drinking
with General Darshkevich in Novgorod.

15:05.017 --> 15:06.951
That was worse headache.

15:10.089 --> 15:12.387
Dr. Jackson is good friend
of yours, yes?

15:13.059 --> 15:14.458
Indeed he is.

15:16.929 --> 15:21.593
Despite what you are thinking, you bear
no responsibility for what has transpired.

15:23.869 --> 15:28.272
My presence here has resulted in
the quarantine of this entire complex.

15:28.341 --> 15:31.504
Had you remained in your homeland, you
would have faced a similar situation...

15:31.577 --> 15:33.511
only in a different setting.

15:33.579 --> 15:35.740
Again, through
no fault of your own.

15:35.815 --> 15:37.282
Perhaps.

15:40.052 --> 15:42.577
But at the moment
I can't be sure of anything.

15:44.323 --> 15:46.314
Has your memory
not yet returned?

15:46.392 --> 15:48.383
In my dreams...

15:49.829 --> 15:52.423
I have begun to see flashes.

15:53.532 --> 15:56.194
Glimpses of these past few days.

15:56.269 --> 15:59.432
Walking these halls,
talking to people.

15:59.505 --> 16:02.997
And yet it's as if
I am not even here.

16:06.479 --> 16:09.642
I'm just a helpless observer
inside my own body.

16:15.288 --> 16:18.155
One month ago,
Anatole Konstantinov fell ill...

16:18.224 --> 16:21.591
after completing a tour on
the International Space Station.

16:21.661 --> 16:23.822
I remember.
We monitored the mission.

16:23.896 --> 16:26.490
We lost contact for almost 30 seconds
and never figured out why.

16:26.565 --> 16:28.499
I don't know if they're connected...

16:28.567 --> 16:31.627
but he died less than a week later
in a Moscow hospital.

16:31.704 --> 16:34.264
Now, officially the cause of death
was renal failure...

16:34.340 --> 16:38.834
but unofficially the Russian authorities
haven't a clue what killed him.

16:38.911 --> 16:40.538
Think it might be
our mystery disease?

16:40.613 --> 16:43.514
Among the symptoms he exhibited
were memory loss...

16:43.582 --> 16:46.016
skin lesions and a highly elevated
white blood count.

16:46.085 --> 16:48.349
Is there any connection
to Colonel Vaselov?

16:48.421 --> 16:51.822
Apparently Vaselov visited Konstantinov
in the hospital just before he died.

16:51.891 --> 16:54.792
They were old friends. They served
together in the Russian Air Force.

16:54.860 --> 16:56.452
Why didn't they tell us this?

16:56.529 --> 16:59.760
They determined that Konstantinov's
condition wasn't contagious.

16:59.832 --> 17:01.766
He came into contact
with many people...

17:01.834 --> 17:05.270
between the time he returned to Earth and
the time he checked into the hospital...

17:05.338 --> 17:07.568
but no one else ever showed
signs of being infected.

17:08.641 --> 17:10.700
Makes it an oddly selective disease.

17:10.776 --> 17:13.006
Perhaps we are not dealing
with a disease at all.

17:13.079 --> 17:17.311
Colonel Vaselov possessed only vague
random memories of his time at Stargate...

17:17.383 --> 17:19.317
and yet the instances
he could recall...

17:19.385 --> 17:22.149
he described himself as a mere
observer to the actions of his body.

17:22.221 --> 17:23.882
Like being host to a symbiote.

17:23.956 --> 17:26.652
But tests ruled out
the possibility of a Goa'uld.

17:26.726 --> 17:29.194
Could we be looking at
some other form of alien possession?

17:29.261 --> 17:31.491
Yeah. It's possible.

17:31.564 --> 17:34.533
An entity capable of moving
from individual to individual.

17:34.600 --> 17:36.568
Might explain some of
the inconsistencies.

17:36.635 --> 17:38.728
If that's true,
it could be in anyone right now.

17:46.746 --> 17:49.442
Hello. I'll be right there.

17:50.616 --> 17:52.106
Daniel's awake.

17:56.522 --> 17:58.786
Anyone wanna please tell me
what the hell is going on?

17:58.858 --> 18:01.691
- You're recovering from a gunshot wound.
- What?

18:01.761 --> 18:03.752
You have no recollection
of the incident?

18:04.463 --> 18:06.192
No. Who shot me?

18:06.265 --> 18:10.099
Don't... change the subject.
What do you remember?

18:11.637 --> 18:13.764
I went to see
Colonel Vaselov...

18:13.839 --> 18:16.808
and right in the middle of
our conversation he collapsed...

18:16.876 --> 18:19.868
and I went to help him,
and... that's it.

18:19.945 --> 18:22.106
You don't remember
accompanying him to the infirmary?

18:25.284 --> 18:27.275
Who shot me?

18:38.898 --> 18:42.527
- You were shooting up the gate room.
- You wounded two guards.

18:42.601 --> 18:45.661
We think we may be dealing with
a foothold situation.

18:45.738 --> 18:48.969
Specifically an alien entity
capable of taking over human hosts...

18:49.041 --> 18:51.009
not unlike the Goa'uld.

18:51.076 --> 18:54.068
And it seems to be able
to travel from person to person.

18:54.146 --> 18:57.582
Although at present we have
no knowledge of how this is possible.

19:08.828 --> 19:10.227
Anubis.

19:12.264 --> 19:13.288
I was Anubis.

19:19.305 --> 19:22.103
Or rather Anubis
was controlling me.

19:22.174 --> 19:24.005
Anubis is dead.

19:24.076 --> 19:26.010
No, he's not.

19:27.046 --> 19:28.877
He's here in the base.

19:33.419 --> 19:38.118
You'd think that getting blasted out of
orbit would've slowed the guy down.

19:38.190 --> 19:39.987
According to DanielJackson...

19:40.059 --> 19:42.619
Anubis surrendered his
mortal form when he was ascended...

19:42.695 --> 19:45.220
only to be cast down
by the Ancients.

19:45.297 --> 19:48.528
As a result, he exists purely
as an immaterial being.

19:49.602 --> 19:53.060
In the past when we encountered Anubis
the physical form we were seeing...

19:53.138 --> 19:55.936
was actually a force shield
designed to contain his essence.

19:56.008 --> 19:58.568
When it was destroyed,
that essence was released.

19:58.644 --> 20:02.603
Anubis was trapped in Earth's orbit,
inhabiting debris from his ship...

20:02.681 --> 20:04.842
millions of light-years
away from his power base.

20:04.917 --> 20:08.011
- So he hitched a ride on a cosmonaut?
- Yes, sir.

20:08.087 --> 20:10.146
And then abandoned him
for Colonel Vaselov.

20:10.222 --> 20:12.349
No doubt attempting
to escape through our gate.

20:12.424 --> 20:14.915
Why doesn't he just use...

20:14.994 --> 20:18.691
his freaky, super-cosmic powers
and just...

20:20.866 --> 20:21.764
go?

20:21.834 --> 20:23.597
Doing so would alert the Ancients...

20:23.669 --> 20:25.694
and only serve to bring down
their wrath upon him.

20:25.771 --> 20:29.605
To interact with the physical world,
he has to get himself a new shield...

20:29.675 --> 20:31.609
but he can't do that
here on Earth.

20:31.677 --> 20:34.111
He'll need a body to dial
the gate and get through.

20:34.179 --> 20:36.909
Eventually, Anubis
will attempt escape again.

20:39.018 --> 20:43.114
He's on the base,
obviously not going anywhere.

20:45.024 --> 20:46.958
Tell me there's
something we can do.

20:49.028 --> 20:51.826
As a matter of fact, sir,
I think there is.

21:03.676 --> 21:05.075
Hey.

21:05.144 --> 21:06.975
What's goin' on?

21:07.046 --> 21:11.278
General O'Neill has ordered compulsory
physicals for all the SGC personnel.

21:12.017 --> 21:14.542
We're operating under the assumption
that retaining Anubis's essence...

21:14.620 --> 21:16.554
exacts a physical toll
on the carrier.

21:16.622 --> 21:18.590
You were only exposed
for a couple of hours...

21:18.657 --> 21:21.421
but your body reacted as though
you were fighting off an infection.

21:21.493 --> 21:24.553
So whoever's retaining his essence
should start showing symptoms.

21:24.630 --> 21:26.598
Yeah. That's the theory.

21:27.600 --> 21:29.568
What about Vaselov?

21:34.106 --> 21:36.040
His is a more extreme case.

21:36.108 --> 21:39.077
He was exposed for over a week. That's
why his symptoms are more advanced.

21:40.079 --> 21:42.274
You mean with the lesions and the-

21:43.349 --> 21:45.317
Yeah, it's actually more than that.

21:47.019 --> 21:49.146
His entire immune system
was affected.

21:50.422 --> 21:53.289
But Anubis is out of him.
He should start getting better, right?

21:58.964 --> 22:00.955
Dr. Brightman says
he's not responding.

22:01.033 --> 22:04.127
She thinks the exposure may have
simply gone on for too long.

22:04.203 --> 22:07.434
- Damage is done.
- There has to be something we can do.

22:08.507 --> 22:10.600
We can help him manage the pain.
That's about it.

22:25.124 --> 22:28.958
I said the situation was contained.
I did not say it was resolved.

22:30.362 --> 22:32.296
No. I can't do that.

22:32.364 --> 22:36.130
Command will stay under lockdown
until I decide otherwise.

22:39.238 --> 22:41.172
Yes, sir. It is my call.

22:42.474 --> 22:43.964
Yes, sir.

22:47.846 --> 22:50.076
Pentagon. Getting a little antsy.

22:50.149 --> 22:53.812
They're not the only ones. We got
a bunch of very anxious people out there.

22:54.887 --> 22:56.377
I'll bet.

22:57.556 --> 22:59.524
What can I do for you, Doctor?

22:59.591 --> 23:01.525
It's concerning Colonel Vaselov.

23:01.593 --> 23:04.960
His condition hasn't improved,
and he's not responding to treatment.

23:05.030 --> 23:09.296
Unless circumstances change,
I'd give him a week, two weeks tops.

23:10.335 --> 23:12.326
I'll inform the Russians.

23:12.404 --> 23:14.065
Thank you, sir.

23:23.182 --> 23:24.581
Dr. Jackson?

23:25.517 --> 23:27.678
Alexi, sorry.
I didn't mean to disturb you.

23:28.787 --> 23:33.690
I'm glad to see you are up and about.
Are you being discharged?

23:33.759 --> 23:36.785
Yeah. Dr. Brightman caught me stealing
Jell-O from the other patient's tray...

23:36.862 --> 23:38.591
so she kicked me out.

23:42.034 --> 23:43.524
Doctor...

23:46.371 --> 23:48.737
I wonder if you could
do me a favor.

23:54.646 --> 23:57.137
I have a sister in Bryansk.

23:58.183 --> 24:01.880
When the lockdown has ended,
could you see that she gets this?

24:03.522 --> 24:06.116
The nurses have been careful
not to say anything.

24:07.226 --> 24:09.251
That is always a bad sign.

24:12.397 --> 24:13.887
Please.

24:21.306 --> 24:23.797
In Russia we have a saying.

24:31.583 --> 24:36.486
"The cord may curl long,
but an end will appear."

24:38.524 --> 24:42.756
That holds true for everything
in this world- myself included.

24:44.229 --> 24:45.821
I accept this.

24:52.204 --> 24:55.605
"In the kingdom of hope,
there is no winter."

24:57.209 --> 24:58.972
I prefer that one.

24:59.044 --> 25:00.978
<i>Da.</i> It's a nice saying.

25:04.750 --> 25:06.741
I'll come see ya.

25:20.732 --> 25:23.257
- His pulse is weak.
- He's lost a lot of blood.

25:23.335 --> 25:25.200
Dr. Jackson,
can you hear me?

25:39.685 --> 25:41.152
Dr. Jackson?

25:42.654 --> 25:44.144
Lieutenant Evans.

25:45.190 --> 25:47.351
He's in Lieutenant Evans.

25:58.670 --> 26:02.970
I was examined by Dr. Brightman a couple
of hours ago. She said I was fine.

26:03.041 --> 26:05.669
It's possible you haven't
started manifesting signs yet.

26:06.645 --> 26:10.274
<i>Colonel, I would know. If something</i>
<i>like that happened to me, I would know.</i>

26:11.950 --> 26:13.577
<i>I'm not lying.</i>

26:14.519 --> 26:16.919
Lieutenant, tell me what you did
Tuesday afternoon.

26:17.923 --> 26:20.892
- I don't understand.
- Just tell me.

26:25.297 --> 26:28.425
- Lieutenant?
- I don't know.

26:28.500 --> 26:30.400
You don't know?

26:32.104 --> 26:34.095
I can't remember.

26:38.510 --> 26:40.000
O'Neill.

26:40.679 --> 26:42.874
I have been informed that
Airman Malcolm McCaffrey...

26:42.948 --> 26:45.007
has missed a scheduled
appointment at the infirmary.

26:45.083 --> 26:47.074
He remains unaccounted for.

27:05.170 --> 27:07.297
- It's right down there.
- Come on.

27:08.307 --> 27:10.298
What have you got?

27:23.355 --> 27:26.483
- <i>General O'Neill.</i>
- Yeah. O'Neill here. Go.

27:26.558 --> 27:28.492
This is Major Kearney.

27:28.560 --> 27:31.825
I've got a wounded man here, claims
he was jumped by Airman McCaffrey.

27:31.897 --> 27:33.865
We think he's headed for
the control room.

27:33.932 --> 27:36.867
<i>Advise caution, General.</i>
<i>The target is armed.</i>

27:36.935 --> 27:39.301
On our way.

27:52.784 --> 27:54.775
Dial the gate.

28:38.997 --> 28:40.931
Mind if I come in?

28:40.999 --> 28:42.967
You're not supposed to be
walkin' around.

28:44.036 --> 28:46.027
It's my arm.

28:47.272 --> 28:50.605
- You were shot.
- I know. You shot me.

28:51.343 --> 28:53.607
Not the point.

28:53.678 --> 28:56.579
Look. I heard what happened.
Anubis is still here.

28:56.648 --> 28:59.708
Daniel, he can
pass through walls.

28:59.785 --> 29:02.015
He's welcome to leave
the base at any time.

29:02.087 --> 29:05.420
He has to go through the Stargate,
otherwise he's trapped on Earth.

29:05.490 --> 29:08.254
Yeah. There's not much we can do.

29:08.326 --> 29:09.884
- Can't kill him.
- No.

29:09.961 --> 29:11.258
- Can't catch him.
- No.

29:11.329 --> 29:14.389
- So-
- We let the Ancients deal with him.

29:14.466 --> 29:17.629
Yes. Because they've always
been so helpful.

29:17.702 --> 29:21.934
If he uses his powers as an ascended being,
he's breaking the rules.

29:22.007 --> 29:24.168
They will take action.

29:25.210 --> 29:27.371
We just have to
take away his other options.

29:30.082 --> 29:32.107
I assume you have a plan.

29:38.757 --> 29:41.248
Anubis has made two attempts
to get through the gate.

29:41.326 --> 29:43.521
In both instances
we were able to stop him...

29:43.595 --> 29:46.223
but there's no guarantee
we'll be so lucky next time.

29:46.298 --> 29:49.825
We have to make it as difficult as
possible for him to access the Stargate.

29:49.901 --> 29:53.234
To that end, we're proposing
a division of the facility...

29:53.305 --> 29:57.298
into three separate sections,
designated Zones 1, <i>2 and 3.</i>

29:57.375 --> 29:59.309
Power to the gate
has been shut off...

29:59.377 --> 30:01.777
and will no longer be accessible
from the control room.

30:01.847 --> 30:07.581
It can now only be reestablished from
a relay center located here in Zone 1.

30:07.652 --> 30:12.248
The control room, gate room and
surrounding areas are designated Zone <i>2.</i>

30:12.324 --> 30:15.657
Intermediate corridors linking
the two zones will be sealed.

30:15.727 --> 30:18.491
Corridors linking directly to
the gate room will also be sealed.

30:18.563 --> 30:21.430
The only means of unsealing
these corridors...

30:21.500 --> 30:26.267
will be from a security control center
located here in Zone 3.

30:26.338 --> 30:29.000
All personnel will be restricted
to one of these three zones.

30:29.074 --> 30:32.168
Standing food and medical supplies will
be divided amongst the three sections.

30:32.244 --> 30:34.439
Dr. Brightman's team will be
split into three units...

30:34.513 --> 30:37.209
and continue monitoring personnel
through daily physical examinations.

30:37.282 --> 30:39.216
Now, no one-
not even General O'Neill-

30:39.284 --> 30:42.515
will be permitted access to
a neighboring zone until lockdown ends.

30:43.622 --> 30:45.556
Any questions so far?

30:48.760 --> 30:51.251
With all due respect,
given everything we know about Anubis...

30:51.329 --> 30:53.559
do you really think
this is going to stop him?

30:55.567 --> 30:57.296
The point is to make it impossible...

30:57.369 --> 30:59.769
for him to get through the gate
in the body of one person.

30:59.838 --> 31:01.772
When he realizes he can't
get out that way...

31:01.840 --> 31:04.400
he'll have no choice but to risk
revealing himself to the Ancients.

31:43.448 --> 31:45.643
<i>Zone 1 secure.</i>

31:51.790 --> 31:53.758
Zone 3 secure.

31:57.262 --> 31:59.253
Zone <i>2 secure.</i>

31:59.331 --> 32:00.821
Good luck.

32:03.134 --> 32:05.068
Blood pressure's still quite low.

32:41.172 --> 32:42.662
Yes, Mr. President.

32:45.543 --> 32:47.909
Yes, sir.
Six days without incident.

32:49.414 --> 32:51.848
Yes. All SG personnel
present and accounted for.

32:53.151 --> 32:55.483
No. No one has shown
any physical symptoms, sir...

32:55.553 --> 32:57.851
but that doesn't mean
Anubis is gone.

32:59.691 --> 33:01.682
It's the president.

33:04.262 --> 33:07.322
Yes, sir. Of course I understand
the importance of the program...

33:07.399 --> 33:09.333
but I would be-

33:12.070 --> 33:14.061
I understand, sir.

33:16.641 --> 33:18.131
Hello?

33:24.816 --> 33:29.719
I've got <i>2 4 hours to reestablish
"normal gate operations."</i>

33:29.788 --> 33:32.985
It was unreasonable to assume the lockdown
could be maintained indefinitely.

33:35.293 --> 33:38.023
Yeah. I suppose.

33:42.400 --> 33:44.994
<i>Attention all personnel.</i>

33:45.837 --> 33:47.395
<i>This is General O'Neill.</i>

33:49.741 --> 33:52.904
<i>I know the current situation</i>
<i>has been tough on all of you.</i>

33:52.977 --> 33:56.140
<i>You've been cut off from</i>
<i>your families, your homes.</i>

33:57.248 --> 34:00.217
<i>You're wondering</i>
<i>how much longer this can go on.</i>

34:01.786 --> 34:04.812
<i>But the fact is there's</i>
<i>a threat on this base...</i>

34:04.889 --> 34:06.914
<i>that cannot be allowed</i>
<i>to escape.</i>

34:09.060 --> 34:12.257
<i>Knowing that, the president</i>
<i>has authorized me...</i>

34:12.330 --> 34:14.457
<i>to maintain this lockdown</i>
<i>indefinitely.</i>

34:17.102 --> 34:19.161
We've only got food enough
for another month.

34:20.105 --> 34:24.041
So we'll find a secure way to bring
supplies down from the surface.

34:25.377 --> 34:28.813
In the meantime,
I suggest you all get comfortable.

34:29.881 --> 34:31.872
We're not going anywhere.

34:50.301 --> 34:52.292
I need to run a diagnostic.

35:39.884 --> 35:41.374
Hey, Sam.

36:41.346 --> 36:44.873
- Teal'c, this is Daniel.
- Proceed, DanielJackson.

36:44.949 --> 36:48.043
Anubis has got Sam.
She's headed your way.

36:50.121 --> 36:51.611
Understood.

37:45.310 --> 37:46.504
<i>Go ahead.</i>

37:46.578 --> 37:50.309
Anubis tampered with the security system.
He set up a sequence of timed commands.

37:50.381 --> 37:52.906
We're trying to override,
but we're not having much luck.

37:53.718 --> 37:55.652
Keep me posted.

37:59.490 --> 38:02.220
Keep an eye on 'em.
Kearney, you're with me.

38:08.600 --> 38:10.295
General.

38:10.368 --> 38:11.858
Major.

38:15.173 --> 38:16.663
Sir?

38:17.742 --> 38:19.676
Ready your key.

38:24.782 --> 38:27.307
Major, base security
is being compromised.

38:27.385 --> 38:30.081
Ready your key.
That's an order.

38:33.191 --> 38:34.681
Yes, sir.

38:43.234 --> 38:45.168
Counting down from three...

38:46.004 --> 38:48.666
two, one, turn.

38:53.077 --> 38:55.409
<i>Five minutes till self-destruct.</i>

38:55.480 --> 38:57.414
<i>Five minutes till self-destruct.</i>

39:05.523 --> 39:07.184
You did good, son.

39:14.365 --> 39:16.492
<i>Four minutes till self-destruct.</i>

39:16.567 --> 39:18.592
<i>Four minutes till self-destruct.</i>

39:28.579 --> 39:31.514
- Sir!
- Come no further.

39:31.582 --> 39:34.779
Teal'c, you have to give me
access to the base computer.

39:34.852 --> 39:37.514
Someone activated the self-destruct.
Let me shut it down.

39:37.588 --> 39:40.352
- You are infected.
- I was infected.

39:40.425 --> 39:44.225
- Anubis left me for someone else.
- Of this I cannot be certain.

39:44.295 --> 39:48.026
Teal'c, I'm not Anubis.
It's me. Carter.

39:48.099 --> 39:50.363
<i>Three minutes till self-destruct.</i>

39:50.435 --> 39:51.925
Teal'c, please.

39:57.642 --> 39:59.132
Very well.

40:12.857 --> 40:14.791
<i>Self-destruct aborted.</i>

40:14.859 --> 40:16.793
<i>Self-destruct aborted.</i>

40:17.795 --> 40:19.285
Well done.

40:33.611 --> 40:35.442
Someone's activated the gate.

40:42.553 --> 40:46.421
Teal'c, this is Daniel. I think Anubis
is headed for the gate room.

40:46.491 --> 40:47.822
Understood.

40:47.892 --> 40:50.224
I'll see if I can override
the dialing sequence.

41:09.247 --> 41:10.805
Stand aside.

41:10.882 --> 41:12.873
<i>Nyet.</i>

41:20.658 --> 41:22.922
You need a body
to go through the gate.

41:23.795 --> 41:24.989
Take mine.

41:26.697 --> 41:29.029
Take mine, or I'll kill us both.

42:09.240 --> 42:11.572
- General.
- I'm okay.

42:12.243 --> 42:13.733
Ish.

42:15.847 --> 42:17.337
Wait.

42:20.117 --> 42:22.347
He got through, didn't he?

42:22.420 --> 42:23.910
Sort of.

42:24.622 --> 42:27.090
I was able to override
the established dialing sequence...

42:27.158 --> 42:29.388
and input an alternate address.

42:29.460 --> 42:32.554
I sent him to KS7-535 instead.

42:37.768 --> 42:39.258
Chilly.
