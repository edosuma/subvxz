18:06.960 --> 18:08.200
So they'll go free?

18:08.480 --> 18:09.641
Not quite, sir.

18:11.400 --> 18:12.811
See, I have plans

18:13.680 --> 18:14.920
for the Peaky Blinders.

18:19.080 --> 18:20.127
All right?

18:20.320 --> 18:23.290
(EXCITED CONVERSATION)

18:23.960 --> 18:25.644
POLLY: Leave that, boys,
we'll get back to it later.

18:25.720 --> 18:26.846
TOMMY: Right.

18:26.920 --> 18:28.445
We've brought you all here today

18:29.080 --> 18:32.209
'cause this is the day
we replace Billy Kimber.

18:32.680 --> 18:34.921
This is the day we become respectable.

18:35.440 --> 18:42.164
The day we join the official National
Association of Racecourse Bookmakers.

18:43.960 --> 18:45.086
But, first,

18:45.840 --> 18:46.921
we do the dirty work.

18:47.720 --> 18:49.688
Now, you've all known
this day's been coming,

18:49.760 --> 18:51.285
I just haven't told anyone the date.

18:55.400 --> 18:57.289
We're going to the Worcester races.

18:57.720 --> 18:59.722
Track opens at 1:00,
we get there at 2:00.

19:00.240 --> 19:03.005
Now, Kimber thinks we're going there
to help him fight the Lee brothers.

19:04.200 --> 19:05.929
Thanks to the efforts of ourjohn

19:06.520 --> 19:08.409
and his lovely new wife, Esme,

19:08.480 --> 19:10.687
the Lees are now our kin.

19:11.440 --> 19:13.841
I interrupted those efforts this morning
and, uh,

19:14.080 --> 19:17.766
I can assure you all,
john is making great sacrifices

19:18.480 --> 19:19.970
in the cause of peace.

19:20.040 --> 19:21.087
Yea h, all rig ht.

19:21.360 --> 19:24.967
So it'll be us and the Lees against
Kimber's boys.

19:25.680 --> 19:28.160
We take 'em out and leave the bookies.

19:28.880 --> 19:32.202
I'll expect a swift victory which will
send a signal all the way to London

19:32.280 --> 19:37.525
that we believe in letting legitimate
businesses run peacefully.

19:38.280 --> 19:41.409
JOHN:
And, uh, what about Kimber himself?

19:42.280 --> 19:43.805
I'll deal with Kimber.

19:44.320 --> 19:45.481
Any other questions?

19:47.560 --> 19:48.641
Yes.

19:51.680 --> 19:54.445
Does anyone object if I bring
a newcomer to the meeting?

19:59.320 --> 20:00.321
(WHISPERING) Come on.

20:02.840 --> 20:06.640
I'd like to introduce the newest member
of the Shelby clan.

20:09.480 --> 20:11.369
(APPLAUSE)

20:16.880 --> 20:18.166
Welcome home, Ada.

20:19.920 --> 20:20.967
We named him Karl.

20:21.960 --> 20:23.041
After Karl Marx.

20:23.680 --> 20:25.091
Karl bloody Marx.

20:25.160 --> 20:26.446
Let me get a look at him.

20:26.520 --> 20:27.760
Oh, here we go.

20:28.120 --> 20:29.167
ARTHUR: Hey, look!

20:29.920 --> 20:31.649
He looksjust like me, look!

20:32.800 --> 20:35.280
- MAN: Unless his arse looks like you.
- ARTHUR: He's all right.

20:35.920 --> 20:37.081
He's a Shelby.

20:37.800 --> 20:38.881
Well, Ada...

20:40.560 --> 20:41.925
Am I forgiven?

20:42.600 --> 20:45.763
If what Aunt Polly says is true,
you are.

20:47.760 --> 20:48.841
It's true.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.126
(SIGHS)

20:51.920 --> 20:53.081
Thank you, Tommy.

20:58.200 --> 20:59.440
THORNE: So who the hell are you?

20:59.960 --> 21:01.724
POLICEMAN:
Someone who wants to keep his eyes.

21:02.840 --> 21:04.365
They came to my house,

21:05.280 --> 21:07.487
told me to volunteer for this.

21:07.760 --> 21:08.807
Who did?

21:09.920 --> 21:11.001
The Peaky Blinders.

21:18.760 --> 21:20.489
Tommy, Tommy, Tommy.

22:13.680 --> 22:14.681
POLICEMAN 1: Get out of the way!

22:18.200 --> 22:19.361
THORN E: What the bloody hell is that?

22:19.720 --> 22:21.210
Looks like your friends are here.

22:26.360 --> 22:29.364
Stay down on the ground!
Or the next one's for you.

22:33.600 --> 22:34.601
<i>Uh'.!</i>

22:34.680 --> 22:35.966
POLICEMAN 2: Make it look good.

22:36.320 --> 22:38.448
I am sorry about this, comrade.

22:40.080 --> 22:41.081
Holy shit!

22:41.600 --> 22:44.251
- Danny, you're dead!
- No. I've been living in London.

22:44.320 --> 22:45.446
Same thing.

22:46.320 --> 22:47.321
In you get.

22:54.640 --> 22:55.926
All right, lads, listen up.

22:56.000 --> 22:59.368
You have a pint and a chaser,
no more, on the house.

23:00.840 --> 23:03.684
Right. Let's get pouring.

23:04.720 --> 23:06.484
Do you have the enclosure tickets?

23:06.640 --> 23:08.449
And the registered bookkeepers
on the track?

23:08.840 --> 23:09.921
In me coat.

23:11.480 --> 23:12.891
You did a good job, Grace.

23:14.000 --> 23:15.001
- Much.
- Much.

(CLEARS TH ROAT)

23:18.200 --> 23:19.531
Next family meeting,

23:20.120 --> 23:21.246
I'll make sure you're there.

23:22.680 --> 23:23.841
If I were family.

23:24.480 --> 23:25.845
But I'm not.

23:27.120 --> 23:28.281
That could change.

23:29.720 --> 23:31.085
- Tommy...
- We'll talk about it more

23:31.160 --> 23:32.650
when I get back, all right?

23:32.720 --> 23:33.767
When will you be back?

23:34.040 --> 23:35.963
Oh, is this how it's gonna be, eh?

23:37.040 --> 23:38.690
You waiting at home for me,

23:39.200 --> 23:40.531
saying, "What time do you call this?"

23:42.280 --> 23:43.850
The barrel needs changing.

23:47.200 --> 23:51.000
Go on, Tom. Go out the back,
give her a good seeing to before we go.

23:59.360 --> 24:00.407
All right?

24:01.200 --> 24:03.202
Hey, Grace, I wasjoking.

-(KNOCKING AT DOOR)
- MAN: Tommy, we need more mild.

24:06.280 --> 24:08.009
Just help yourselves!

24:10.600 --> 24:11.726
Tommy, the truth is...

24:12.400 --> 24:14.164
When you come back from the races,
I won't be here.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.081
What are you talking about?

24:19.320 --> 24:20.446
All right, look.

24:20.520 --> 24:23.364
Grace, I know you weren't born
to be with a man like me.

24:25.960 --> 24:27.450
But I'm turning things around.

24:28.200 --> 24:31.647
When I get back here tonight,
I will have

24:32.360 --> 24:36.490
one of the biggest legal race track
syndicates in the country.

24:38.400 --> 24:40.971
I'm gonna close down
some of that other stuff.

24:43.200 --> 24:44.406
Maybe open a club.

24:45.960 --> 24:47.644
Hey, back in London.

24:49.240 --> 24:50.366
And another thing,

24:53.280 --> 24:54.884
you have a contract of employment.

24:55.680 --> 24:58.081
With a real limited company.

24:58.680 --> 24:59.761
You remember?

25:00.400 --> 25:01.970
I remember everything, Tommy.

25:02.400 --> 25:03.970
I am going to a make a success of this.

25:05.440 --> 25:07.044
I am going to a make a success of it.

25:07.440 --> 25:08.601
- I am.
- I know.

25:09.240 --> 25:10.366
I know.

25:11.880 --> 25:13.644
I'm not talking about marriage.

25:14.640 --> 25:15.721
I'm so...

25:17.560 --> 25:18.641
We know each other.

25:19.120 --> 25:20.281
We can talk.

25:21.200 --> 25:22.281
We're the same.

25:23.080 --> 25:26.129
Tommy,
I've done something terrible to you.

25:29.200 --> 25:31.521
Right. Tell him what you just told me.

25:32.160 --> 25:34.128
Just heard there's two vans driving up
the Stratford Road.

25:34.400 --> 25:36.687
JEREMIAH: An old corporal of mine said
he recognised some of the men.

25:36.760 --> 25:38.091
He said it's the Kimber boys.

25:38.440 --> 25:39.521
And they're heading this way.

25:46.680 --> 25:47.727

TOMMY: Ada! Wake up!

25:49.000 --> 25:51.890
You and the baby, get into the bullring
where there's lots of people.

25:51.960 --> 25:54.167
- What's going on?
- We've been fucking betrayed.

25:54.280 --> 25:56.886
Someone let slip.
Kimber's men are on their way here.

25:57.280 --> 25:59.601
- Yeah, but you can handle them, Tommy.
- TOMMY: It's just us.

25:59.720 --> 26:02.041
All the Lees are on their way to
Worcester, we're outnumbered.

26:02.640 --> 26:03.641
(SCREAMING) Fuck!

26:03.720 --> 26:06.451
Who else knew today was the day
you were moving on Kimber?

26:06.800 --> 26:09.201
You said you kept it a secret.
Who else did you tell?

26:12.800 --> 26:15.326
There's only one thing can blind
a man as smart as you, Tommy.

26:16.200 --> 26:17.247
Love.

26:17.440 --> 26:18.601
It's that barmaid.

26:21.560 --> 26:23.244
POLLY: I'll deal with Grace.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.651
If you set eyes on her again,
you might kill her.

26:43.920 --> 26:45.046
POLLY: Going for good?

26:45.320 --> 26:46.401
GRACE: I heard there was trouble.

26:47.040 --> 26:48.724
Instinct's a funny thing.

26:50.440 --> 26:53.091
See, normally I can tell about a person,
but with you...

26:53.200 --> 26:54.929
Look, the fighting's about to begin.

26:55.360 --> 26:57.362
- We should get out of here.
- We know who you are.

27:00.960 --> 27:02.086
Tommy knows as well.

27:03.160 --> 27:05.401
Turned out that copper as good as
told him this morning.

27:05.640 --> 27:07.847
But I wanted to hear it
from your own lips.

27:13.640 --> 27:15.449
I am an agent of the Crown.

27:15.640 --> 27:18.928
I have the power to arrest
and the right to use force.

27:19.120 --> 27:22.044
So please, step out of my way.

27:22.120 --> 27:25.841
Like I say, instinct's a funny thing.
You fell for Tommy for real, didn't you?

27:27.560 --> 27:28.800
This gun is loaded.

27:29.680 --> 27:30.806
I'm not afraid of you.

27:31.800 --> 27:33.040
I feel sorry for you.

27:34.160 --> 27:35.286
Slip of a thing.

27:36.240 --> 27:38.163
Thought you'd come in here and stitch us
all up.

27:38.240 --> 27:40.971
I mean, we've had some copper's narks
in here, but you...

27:41.840 --> 27:42.921
You're the queen of them all.

27:45.920 --> 27:47.001
So who are you?

27:49.080 --> 27:50.525
Rich girl, I'd guess.

27:51.640 --> 27:54.883
Unionist. Ulster Volunteer.

27:56.320 --> 28:01.804
You thought, "Fenians, communists,
low people...

28:02.640 --> 28:05.689
"They're all the same. Scum."

28:06.800 --> 28:07.961
Then you met Tommy.

28:13.440 --> 28:16.284
I'll fight you with my fists
and show you how a rich girl fights.

28:17.240 --> 28:18.890
I'm from a tough family, too.

28:26.280 --> 28:27.486
Nah.

28:29.680 --> 28:31.170
We women have more sense.

28:33.080 --> 28:34.605
Why don't you pour us both a drink?

28:48.000 --> 28:49.161
So am I right?

28:53.280 --> 28:54.645
Did you fall for Tommy?

29:03.560 --> 29:04.641
Yes, I did.

29:05.040 --> 29:06.166
Then I pity you.

29:07.600 --> 29:09.170
You think he'll try to kill me?

29:10.240 --> 29:11.321
That's too soft.

29:11.480 --> 29:12.925
- Soft?
- Soft.

29:13.960 --> 29:15.007
Like you.

29:15.800 --> 29:17.768
You saved his life the night
the coppers came.

29:19.280 --> 29:21.203
That's why we're drinking, not fighting.

29:22.760 --> 29:23.966
We owe you.

29:30.160 --> 29:31.286
What was he like?

29:32.640 --> 29:33.721
Before France?

29:35.520 --> 29:38.046
He laughed. A lot.

29:40.040 --> 29:41.804
He wanted to work with horses.

29:44.360 --> 29:45.441
He won medals?

29:45.520 --> 29:46.601
Threw them in the cut.

29:48.240 --> 29:50.447
Not a single man came back the same.

29:52.880 --> 29:55.770
You know, after all this is over,

29:57.560 --> 29:58.721
he might forgive you.

29:59.600 --> 30:00.681
He might take you in.

30:01.040 --> 30:02.121
Can never tell with men.

30:02.920 --> 30:06.288
They go for whoever their dicks point at
and there's no changing their minds.

30:06.640 --> 30:07.846
But I should tell you something.

30:09.960 --> 30:11.405
I will never forgive you.

30:13.040 --> 30:14.530
Or accept you.

30:15.480 --> 30:16.527
Or take you in.

30:18.360 --> 30:21.091
And it's me who runs the business
of the heart in this family.

30:22.960 --> 30:24.564
And as far as I'm concerned,

30:25.520 --> 30:27.329
you're a snitch from the parish.

30:28.680 --> 30:30.842
And if you're not gone from this city
by tomorrow,

30:32.480 --> 30:33.766
I'll kill you myself.

30:39.960 --> 30:41.041
Now go.

30:55.440 --> 30:57.329
Maybe what really upsets you

30:57.960 --> 30:59.928
is the thought that one day
you might lose him.

31:12.600 --> 31:15.251
Tommy! We've had word
from Nipper at Hay Mills,

31:15.320 --> 31:16.606
and he says
the police are letting them through.

31:18.000 --> 31:19.570
And how come all our police
have disappeared?

31:19.640 --> 31:22.291
'Cause it was the police who told
Kimber about the plan.

31:22.440 --> 31:23.521
And who told the police?

31:23.600 --> 31:27.400
You know what, john?
For all I think I'm the smart one,

31:27.480 --> 31:29.323
I'm guessing it was me.

31:32.200 --> 31:33.281
TOMMY: All right, men.

31:36.400 --> 31:39.688
You were mostly in the war, so you know
that battle plans always change

31:39.760 --> 31:41.922
and get fucked up, well here it is.

31:42.240 --> 31:43.605
Things have changed.

31:43.800 --> 31:46.929
We fight them here. Today. Alone.

31:47.160 --> 31:48.730
Now, they're gonna come for the pub,

31:48.840 --> 31:50.922
they're gonna try
and break us up for good.

31:51.240 --> 31:53.481
And we'll have no help
from the law today.

31:55.080 --> 31:57.287
That pub there is called The Garrison!

31:57.440 --> 31:58.965
Well, now it really is one.

31:59.320 --> 32:01.527
And it belongs to us! Right?

32:01.600 --> 32:02.965
ALL: Right!

32:03.040 --> 32:04.121
How many are there?

32:04.320 --> 32:06.288
Jeremiah said two Reilly vans.

32:07.160 --> 32:09.208
So I reckon we're outnumbered
three to one.

32:09.280 --> 32:10.361
ARTHUR: Ah, fuck.

32:10.440 --> 32:12.966
But it's us, boys, it's us!

32:13.040 --> 32:15.122
The Small Heath rifles.

32:15.400 --> 32:17.164
Never lost a fight yet, did we?

32:17.240 --> 32:18.605
- ALL: No!
- All right!

- Stood down, sir?

from Belfast, I was overjoyed.
