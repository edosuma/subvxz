00:50.958 --> 00:55.457
IN CO-PRODUCTION WITH:

00:55.708 --> 01:02.040
AND THE FINANCIAL SUPPORT OF:

01:02.708 --> 01:07.290
PRESENT A FILM BY:

03:30.250 --> 03:31.250
Please.

03:39.375 --> 03:40.957
What's that you're dragging?

03:41.041 --> 03:42.874
A bed.

03:45.625 --> 03:47.124
How may I help you?

03:47.250 --> 03:48.749
I'd like to live here.

03:50.875 --> 03:52.290
I know you from somewhere.

03:55.166 --> 03:57.124
You've been here once before?

04:00.041 --> 04:01.582
What have you written here?

04:02.250 --> 04:04.249
Place of birth: Pripyat...

04:04.791 --> 04:05.874
That's Chernobyl.

04:09.625 --> 04:12.957
You were born exactly seven
years before the disaster.

04:13.916 --> 04:15.790
On the very same day.

04:17.166 --> 04:19.207
Perhaps you're radioactive?

04:23.250 --> 04:26.207
You didn't specify which
languages you know?

04:28.041 --> 04:29.165
All of them.

04:36.250 --> 04:38.415
What do you want to do?

04:50.375 --> 04:53.957
I feel quite strange around you.

05:02.791 --> 05:04.124
Please help me.

05:21.375 --> 05:25.290
(RUS) I am taking away your misery,
your suffering, your sickness.

05:26.250 --> 05:28.957
(RUS) Like a black stream,
it flows from your feet

05:29.625 --> 05:31.332
(RUS) through your body, your head

05:32.125 --> 05:33.332
(RUS) into my hands.

05:36.250 --> 05:38.124
(RUS) Take a deep breath.

05:41.375 --> 05:43.374
(RUS) As you exhale,
you become lighter

05:44.500 --> 05:45.790
(RUS) like a piece of dust.

07:12.625 --> 07:14.290
Is that bed of yours heavy?

07:16.750 --> 07:18.582
You should come by for some chai!

07:28.958 --> 07:33.207
NEVER GONNA SNOW AGAIN

07:35.500 --> 07:36.957
Oh, Zhenia

07:37.416 --> 07:38.874
I forgot.

07:39.125 --> 07:40.374
Come in!

07:43.125 --> 07:44.249
Get up!

07:44.375 --> 07:46.124
I'm so sorry about this mess. Come!

07:46.166 --> 07:48.934
Get up! The bus won't wait for you!

07:48.958 --> 07:51.082
- Good Morning, sorry.
- Lena's ready!

07:51.125 --> 07:53.476
He's unconscious: the after-effects
of you playing all night!

07:53.500 --> 07:54.832
Are you getting up or not?

07:54.875 --> 07:56.934
You want a massage in that state?

07:56.958 --> 08:00.249
- Mind your own business!
- You drank three bottles of wine last night!

08:00.416 --> 08:02.207
At your own daughter's birthday party!

08:02.250 --> 08:03.457
Mind your own business!

08:03.500 --> 08:04.249
Get up!

08:04.291 --> 08:06.332
- Get up, Kacper!
- Why are you kicking him?

08:06.375 --> 08:08.707
- I didn't kick him, I shifted him.
- You kicked him!

08:08.750 --> 08:10.457
- But you kicked him, I saw it!
- Get up!

08:10.916 --> 08:11.957
Hold this, please.

08:12.250 --> 08:13.832
Eh, we're going to be late!

08:13.875 --> 08:15.415
- Listen, get up.
- Get up!

08:15.791 --> 08:16.791
Oh Lord!

08:16.875 --> 08:17.875
Get up!

08:17.916 --> 08:19.249
Come on, now.

08:20.250 --> 08:22.124
- Take this.
- I'm not eating that crap!

08:22.375 --> 08:23.540
- Let's go.
- Put this on.

08:25.875 --> 08:30.290
Listen, I have cycle training
this evening, so I'll be home late.

08:31.750 --> 08:33.165
See you. Bye.

08:33.375 --> 08:34.874
- Thanks, goodbye.
- Go on!

08:34.916 --> 08:36.082
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, bye.

08:37.791 --> 08:39.832
- Come on.
- Lena, did you take your mask?

08:39.875 --> 08:41.874
Yes, we have everything. Go to the car.

08:41.916 --> 08:42.957
Bye bye!

08:52.250 --> 08:54.226
The most water is used for...

08:54.250 --> 08:57.207
What uses the most water?
Do you remember?

08:57.500 --> 08:59.957
- The production of meat.
- Exactly.

09:00.375 --> 09:01.832
Where will we do the massage?

09:03.166 --> 09:04.332
Here, I guess...

09:04.500 --> 09:05.749
What a mess...

09:13.250 --> 09:14.457
Poo!

09:17.708 --> 09:18.708
Hi.

09:19.875 --> 09:23.082
- Aren't you going to school?
- No. I'm pooing.

09:28.833 --> 09:30.499
Have you seen Santa yet?

09:32.500 --> 09:34.332
It's too early. There's no snow.

09:35.250 --> 09:38.040
It'll never snow again!

09:45.375 --> 09:48.290
Maybe I won't draw the curtains,
the light is so nice.

09:49.250 --> 09:51.124
We have a lovely view here.

10:00.250 --> 10:01.250
I'm sorry.

10:10.166 --> 10:12.726
I want juice! And the iPad!

10:12.750 --> 10:14.665
Can't you see I'm having a massage?

10:14.708 --> 10:16.874
Take the iPad,
I'll get you some juice later.

10:16.916 --> 10:19.142
I want juice! And the iPad!

10:19.166 --> 10:21.165
I said you'll get it in a moment.

10:22.500 --> 10:23.500
Blanka!

10:24.375 --> 10:27.374
How many times have I told you
not to spit on your mother!

10:27.416 --> 10:28.416
I'm sorry.

10:29.250 --> 10:32.249
I'm going to tell your father
that you're spitting again.

10:37.541 --> 10:38.541
Zhenia, juice?

10:39.791 --> 10:40.791
Juice?

10:41.541 --> 10:42.541
There, take it.

10:42.791 --> 10:44.082
Don't spill it on the iPad!

10:44.250 --> 10:45.499
We won't buy you another one.

10:45.958 --> 10:46.958
Sit down here.

10:47.291 --> 10:48.291
I'm sorry.

10:52.916 --> 10:54.957
My son is very independent.

10:55.291 --> 10:57.499
He orders Uber Eats all by himself.

10:57.750 --> 11:02.457
Although the last time he ordered it, the
guy spent ages driving around the estate.

11:02.958 --> 11:05.499
He was lost,
I doubt he had a driver's license.

11:05.750 --> 11:07.082
The food was cold.

11:07.291 --> 11:12.582
Which isn't that bad. My friend told me
she once got a pizza with a bit chewed off!

11:13.125 --> 11:14.957
Maybe they were hungry!

11:16.708 --> 11:18.957
But you can't communicate with them.

11:19.541 --> 11:20.541
It's insane.

11:20.916 --> 11:22.517
Well, obviously, they're all

11:22.541 --> 11:24.540
Pakistanis or Ukrainians...

11:35.958 --> 11:37.499
I'm so sorry Zhenia.

11:38.416 --> 11:42.392
I hope you didn't take what I said
about Ukrainians personally...

11:42.416 --> 11:43.416
Of course not...

11:44.583 --> 11:45.790
(RUS) Everything's fine.

11:46.250 --> 11:47.915
You are different.

11:49.916 --> 11:51.415
You're wonderful.

11:54.250 --> 11:55.332
Slut.

11:57.416 --> 11:58.582
What does that mean?

11:59.291 --> 12:00.291
No, that's...

12:00.958 --> 12:01.958
Blanka...

12:02.166 --> 12:03.415
Better stick to your drawing.

12:04.625 --> 12:06.040
Draw Zhenia!

12:07.458 --> 12:10.476
No, of course, I'm all for it.

12:10.500 --> 12:11.500
I'm...

12:11.625 --> 12:13.165
I'm very tolerant.

12:13.208 --> 12:14.707
Too tolerant, even.

12:15.875 --> 12:20.207
You know, when I think about how hard
life is for you in Ukraine, I...

12:23.791 --> 12:26.874
Funny, I've never been to the East.

12:28.375 --> 12:31.332
I mean, apart from Asia.
But that's not the same.

12:32.541 --> 12:33.541
It's not.

12:38.583 --> 12:40.624
My God, that smells beautiful.

12:42.875 --> 12:43.915
What is it?

12:44.375 --> 12:45.624
Comfrey and pine.

12:48.125 --> 12:49.125
I love it.

12:52.500 --> 12:54.124
I feel like I'm in a forest.

12:56.500 --> 12:57.500
A pinecone...

12:58.500 --> 12:59.749
wilderness...

13:00.791 --> 13:02.332
It makes me think of you.

13:08.125 --> 13:10.332
I feel instantly energised

13:11.791 --> 13:13.415
and relaxed.

13:13.750 --> 13:15.332
I can feel it under my fingers.

13:17.125 --> 13:18.790
You can feel me relaxing?

13:18.833 --> 13:19.833
Of course.

13:20.958 --> 13:23.207
It's all interconnected.

13:24.125 --> 13:25.374
I feel everything.

13:26.916 --> 13:28.165
Stress, fatigue...

13:28.416 --> 13:29.499
psychotropic meds...

13:30.125 --> 13:31.125
alcohol.

13:33.041 --> 13:34.041
Right here.

13:34.625 --> 13:36.207
Tension caused by high heels.

13:36.708 --> 13:38.332
- It hurts!
- It hurts, I know.

13:40.125 --> 13:42.874
But I can also feel the effects
of regular massage.

13:45.833 --> 13:48.249
Looking at your body, I'd say you're 28.

13:52.250 --> 13:54.415
You're exaggerating now...

13:55.125 --> 13:56.165
Yes, really!

13:57.500 --> 13:58.500
Although...

13:59.250 --> 14:01.124
I'd give myself 35.

14:02.125 --> 14:03.457
But I look after myself.

14:17.041 --> 14:18.041
(RUS) You are asleep.

14:25.875 --> 14:26.957
(RUS) You are asleep.

14:39.500 --> 14:40.540
(RUS) You are asleep.

14:51.125 --> 14:52.207
(RUS) I am your healer.

14:54.416 --> 14:56.332
(RUS) I am taking away your misery

14:56.958 --> 14:58.082
(RUS) your suffering

14:58.875 --> 14:59.957
(RUS) your sickness.

15:01.250 --> 15:03.957
(RUS) Like a black stream,
it flows from your feet

15:04.375 --> 15:06.124
(RUS) through your body, your head

15:06.916 --> 15:08.040
(RUS) into my hands.

15:12.958 --> 15:14.665
(RUS) Take a deep breath.

15:18.875 --> 15:20.957
(RUS) As you exhale, you become lighter.

15:22.291 --> 15:23.582
(RUS) Like a piece of dust.

17:02.583 --> 17:03.832
Don't be afraid!

17:04.166 --> 17:05.374
He's just saying hello!

18:09.791 --> 18:10.791
Thank you.

18:13.375 --> 18:16.915
Please get up slowly, you might feel dizzy.

18:54.833 --> 18:56.499
God, I was thirsty.

19:04.958 --> 19:06.749
Fuck, it's that awful guy.

19:08.125 --> 19:10.374
I could've fucking killed you!

19:13.333 --> 19:14.665
He only moved in recently.

19:14.708 --> 19:16.226
You cut me off!

19:16.250 --> 19:18.082
Watch what's happening on the road!

19:18.125 --> 19:20.457
He was in the army. Ex-soldier.

19:22.458 --> 19:24.165
He fights over everything.

19:25.041 --> 19:26.540
Take it and get lost!

19:27.416 --> 19:30.457
I heard he goes around with
a loaded gun. The kids saw it.

19:34.083 --> 19:35.083
Good Morning!

19:40.791 --> 19:42.124
I'm quitting smoking.

19:45.750 --> 19:47.915
I heard that hypnosis can be very helpful.

19:52.958 --> 19:53.958
Thank you.

19:56.250 --> 19:58.290
Perhaps you know how to do hypnosis?

20:01.625 --> 20:03.165
(RUS) Goodbye, Zhenia.

20:40.250 --> 20:41.250
(RUS) A gift.

20:45.541 --> 20:46.541
Come in.

21:01.250 --> 21:02.957
It's nice to see you, Zhenia.

21:03.500 --> 21:04.957
Where will we do the massage?

21:15.500 --> 21:16.790
Sir, could you help me?

21:18.666 --> 21:19.749
My name is Zhenia.

21:29.125 --> 21:30.125
There.

21:30.500 --> 21:31.500
Thanks, Zhenia.

21:37.250 --> 21:38.250
It smells nice.

21:45.958 --> 21:47.415
It's from my region.

21:48.125 --> 21:48.957
From Pripyat.

21:49.125 --> 21:50.165
From Chernobyl?

21:51.250 --> 21:52.250
Close by.

21:56.416 --> 21:57.874
So, it's radioactive.

22:00.250 --> 22:01.250
Possibly.

22:02.291 --> 22:05.374
You know, I felt much worse after chemo.

22:05.666 --> 22:07.059
I tried everything:

22:07.083 --> 22:10.665
radiotherapy, brachytherapy,
chemotherapy, induction therapy,

22:11.041 --> 22:12.874
Tai Chi, acupuncture, and then...

22:13.416 --> 22:15.415
all they suggested was palliative care.

22:21.250 --> 22:22.374
How about hypnosis?

22:29.041 --> 22:30.041
No...

22:30.416 --> 22:32.082
I haven't tried hypnosis.

22:32.916 --> 22:34.851
But I only believe in natural methods!

22:34.875 --> 22:37.707
I've worked through it. I can feel
the illness retreating.

22:38.250 --> 22:41.915
You said yourself that you
can feel it retreating, right?

22:42.416 --> 22:43.416
Yes, of course.

22:45.541 --> 22:47.707
I feel the illness isn't
as strong as it was.

22:50.833 --> 22:51.874
Oh, Vicky dear...

22:52.583 --> 22:54.082
I asked you not to smoke.

22:54.750 --> 22:56.040
I'll put it out in a moment.

23:01.375 --> 23:04.124
But you know, the best cures
are CBD oil, beta glucans

23:04.166 --> 23:07.499
turmeric, mushrooms, garlic,
pomegranates, ginger and skullcap...

23:09.333 --> 23:11.207
Vicky, what was that skullcap thing?

23:11.916 --> 23:13.790
- Baikal.
- That's it.

23:14.291 --> 23:15.957
Baikal, Baikal...

23:17.375 --> 23:19.165
A good diet; herbs

23:20.458 --> 23:22.249
And staying warm. Right, Vicky?

23:39.666 --> 23:41.332
I feel it leaving me, you know?

24:07.083 --> 24:08.457
Sir, don't be scared!

24:08.916 --> 24:10.540
They're just saying hello!

24:25.375 --> 24:26.375
Is your mom home?

24:32.958 --> 24:33.958
Zhenia.

24:36.958 --> 24:37.958
Thank you.

24:53.458 --> 24:54.749
I think he's disturbed.

24:55.500 --> 24:56.957
Jan's friend, unfortunately.

24:57.500 --> 25:00.207
Some strange people have moved in recently.

25:01.416 --> 25:03.582
It used to be all pheasants and meadows.

25:06.166 --> 25:07.166
Pheasant.

25:16.541 --> 25:17.541
Pheasant.

25:30.958 --> 25:32.124
(RUS) Oh, Fazan?

25:34.458 --> 25:35.458
(RUS) Fazan.

25:41.083 --> 25:42.582
Where will we do the massage?

25:46.083 --> 25:47.083
There.

26:15.166 --> 26:16.166
Bye, darling.

26:16.375 --> 26:17.375
- Bye.
- Bye.

26:21.541 --> 26:22.582
Hello.

26:23.541 --> 26:24.541
Hello.

26:24.958 --> 26:26.040
(RUS) Hello, Zhenia.

28:57.250 --> 28:58.250
Down!

28:58.708 --> 29:01.165
Don't be scared,
that's just how he says hello.

29:03.541 --> 29:04.790
Go on!

30:13.583 --> 30:16.332
I can feel the effects of regular massage.

30:18.500 --> 30:20.749
- Judging by your body, I'd say you're...
- Go on?

30:21.291 --> 30:22.374
35 years old.

30:23.958 --> 30:25.124
Not 28?

30:27.375 --> 30:28.375
Well, no.

30:30.375 --> 30:33.290
I'm not concerned about my looks.

30:35.541 --> 30:39.624
Most people here care
only about their looks

30:39.666 --> 30:41.832
and whether they look better than others.

30:42.875 --> 30:47.957
The results, may I add, are poor at best.

30:52.291 --> 30:53.874
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

30:57.125 --> 30:58.934
Aren't you going to school today?

30:58.958 --> 31:01.124
He doesn't have to. He won the Olympiad.

31:01.166 --> 31:02.166
The Olympiad?

31:04.125 --> 31:05.499
So, you are a sportsman.

31:05.541 --> 31:06.832
The Chemistry Olympiad.

31:07.541 --> 31:09.540
He knows how to make aspirin,

31:09.583 --> 31:12.540
he'll be making amphetamines soon.

31:12.916 --> 31:14.415
Clever boy.

31:19.208 --> 31:22.040
I can feel the stress and
fatigue under my fingers.

31:22.875 --> 31:23.875
Alcohol.

31:23.958 --> 31:24.958
Drugs.

31:27.041 --> 31:29.040
Your thinking is stereotypical.

31:30.416 --> 31:35.642
Psychedelics happen to be very effective
cures for PTSD, phobias, and anxiety

31:35.666 --> 31:39.332
and I have a long history
of anxiety in my family.

31:40.041 --> 31:41.540
Besides, psilocybin,

31:41.958 --> 31:44.540
ayahuasca, the vine of the soul,

31:45.250 --> 31:46.582
the devil's snare,

31:47.250 --> 31:48.874
wormwood...

31:50.208 --> 31:52.207
And that fashionable thing now...

31:52.625 --> 31:53.625
MDMA.

31:54.083 --> 31:55.083
MDMA?

31:55.708 --> 31:57.957
Methylenedioxymethamphetamine.

32:01.375 --> 32:02.749
You are an ignoramus.

32:03.666 --> 32:05.124
How's your perception?

32:11.208 --> 32:12.208
What do you see?

32:15.583 --> 32:16.583
(RUS) Circles.

32:16.916 --> 32:19.207
I don't care about the circles.
I see a point.

32:20.333 --> 32:21.333
(RUS) A dot?

32:23.500 --> 32:24.500
I see a point,

32:25.791 --> 32:26.832
you see circles.

32:29.708 --> 32:31.832
(RUS) You - a dot. Me - circles.

32:32.166 --> 32:34.749
From your point of view, it's:
(RUS) you - a dot, me - circles.

32:35.750 --> 32:37.082
(RUS) Me - a dot. You - circles.

32:38.833 --> 32:40.874
Why do you agree to everything?

32:41.750 --> 32:43.374
You offend yourself.

32:43.416 --> 32:46.165
You have to understand
that thoughts are separate.

32:46.208 --> 32:48.290
Thoughts mustn't arouse your emotions.

32:48.333 --> 32:52.832
I made an observation, I shared it with you
and then you had an emotional response.

32:52.875 --> 32:55.624
This is the model taught by your parents.

32:58.250 --> 32:59.250
(RUS) Me - a dot.

33:03.166 --> 33:04.249
(RUS) Me - a dot.

34:42.250 --> 34:44.165
That's just what I needed!

34:45.250 --> 34:46.250
Thank you.

34:46.875 --> 34:49.332
Tell me, what is it that
you have in your hands?

34:49.375 --> 34:50.832
What's in these hands?

34:50.875 --> 34:54.207
Graphite? Some other type of isotope?

34:54.250 --> 34:55.934
I feel high!

34:55.958 --> 34:58.207
Look how much energy I have! Look!

34:58.250 --> 34:59.207
I'm... I'm...

34:59.250 --> 35:00.790
I'm practically bursting!

35:05.875 --> 35:08.415
Vicky dear, I asked you... One a day.

35:10.958 --> 35:13.332
You know how much
this illness has given me?

35:13.375 --> 35:14.375
I...

35:15.250 --> 35:17.476
I wouldn't swap places with anyone.

35:17.500 --> 35:19.749
I live a much fuller life now...

35:21.041 --> 35:23.249
...than I did before, you know?

35:23.791 --> 35:25.707
Vicky will tell you.

35:25.750 --> 35:27.082
I've changed. Right, Vicky?

35:27.125 --> 35:28.874
Yes - darling - you've changed.

35:28.916 --> 35:31.832
You've no idea what we're
preparing for Christmas.

35:32.875 --> 35:34.934
By the way, what are
you doing for Christmas?

35:34.958 --> 35:36.624
I haven't thought about it.

35:36.666 --> 35:38.249
It'll be mind-blowing!

35:40.958 --> 35:43.332
How long have we been preparing?
Three weeks?

35:43.375 --> 35:44.351
Yes.

35:44.375 --> 35:47.207
You must come to our school play!

35:47.250 --> 35:48.582
Kacper will be delighted!

35:48.958 --> 35:51.499
Have you heard about
Houdini's metamorphosis?

35:52.250 --> 35:53.374
He did this thing...

35:53.916 --> 35:54.934
He went and put...

35:54.958 --> 35:56.374
Don't bother Zhenia.

35:57.291 --> 35:58.291
Oh, right...

35:58.875 --> 36:00.332
I don't want to give it away.

36:01.416 --> 36:03.351
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

36:03.375 --> 36:05.749
Remember, you've got to come to the play!

36:05.791 --> 36:06.791
Sure...

36:10.125 --> 36:11.457
It's going to be something else!

38:08.500 --> 38:10.957
- Why aren't you singing?
- I don't know when to start.

38:11.041 --> 38:12.041
One more time.

38:13.375 --> 38:14.375
Focus.

38:14.791 --> 38:16.749
(FR) One, two, three...

38:40.375 --> 38:42.290
I keep getting this 'Ia nuit' wrong...

38:45.875 --> 38:47.582
Don't you know what 'la nuit' means?

38:48.875 --> 38:49.875
I don't.

38:50.666 --> 38:52.415
You don't understand any French.

38:53.791 --> 38:56.249
I don't, but you should be glad
I want to help you.

38:56.500 --> 38:58.374
Then why do we go to a French school?

38:58.416 --> 38:59.934
So that YOU can understand it!

38:59.958 --> 39:01.749
Don't argue, focus!

39:01.958 --> 39:03.165
That makes no sense.

39:04.500 --> 39:05.500
Focus.

39:06.416 --> 39:07.416
...and!

39:11.916 --> 39:12.957
For fuck's sake!

39:15.750 --> 39:17.915
It's wrong to speak to your mom like that.

39:18.500 --> 39:19.790
Mind your own business.

39:21.958 --> 39:24.476
Everything I do in this
house is wrong, Zhenia.

39:24.500 --> 39:26.749
For your information: everything wrong.

39:27.500 --> 39:28.500
Everything.

39:29.250 --> 39:30.250
Hello.

39:31.250 --> 39:33.624
- Aren't you having a massage?
- No, I'm not.

39:49.958 --> 39:51.415
(RUS) Look at my finger.

39:56.583 --> 39:57.957
(RUS) Follow my finger.

40:03.375 --> 40:04.457
(RUS) Close your eyes.

40:08.375 --> 40:10.457
(RUS) You are plunging deep into yourself.

40:14.583 --> 40:16.040
(RUS) Listen to my voice.

40:18.791 --> 40:19.791
(RUS) One.

40:22.166 --> 40:23.166
(RUS) Two.

40:24.958 --> 40:25.958
(RUS) Three.

40:28.250 --> 40:29.250
(RUS) Four.

40:31.500 --> 40:32.500
(RUS) Five.

40:35.416 --> 40:36.416
(RUS) Six.

40:41.041 --> 40:42.041
I don't like...

40:49.916 --> 40:51.374
I don't like it.

40:59.041 --> 41:00.874
I don't like that bike.

41:12.750 --> 41:14.374
I want my daddy.

41:16.583 --> 41:17.957
I want my daddy.

41:19.500 --> 41:21.374
Where is my daddy?

41:27.208 --> 41:28.499
I don't know.

44:08.583 --> 44:10.040
(RUS) When you wake up

44:10.958 --> 44:12.915
(RUS) you will feel a wave of energy.

44:19.125 --> 44:20.457
(RUS) On the count of three.

44:25.166 --> 44:26.166
(RUS) One.

44:28.166 --> 44:29.166
(RUS) Two.

44:32.166 --> 44:33.166
(RUS) Three.

44:41.625 --> 44:42.915
How are you feeling?

44:45.166 --> 44:46.624
I felt so good.

44:52.291 --> 44:53.291
Thank you.

45:04.750 --> 45:06.082
- Bye, darling.
- Bye.

45:07.166 --> 45:08.624
I should hurry, or I'll be late.

46:08.958 --> 46:10.249
- Good Evening.
- Evening.

46:11.333 --> 46:14.249
Some guys were asking
around for you. Two of them.

46:16.833 --> 46:17.833
Let's go.

49:45.250 --> 49:46.582
(RUS) You want to dry up?

49:47.083 --> 49:48.915
(RUS) Want some chai?

49:52.375 --> 49:53.415
Here he is!

49:54.750 --> 49:55.750
Here he is!

49:56.125 --> 49:57.125
Wonder Zhenia!

49:57.375 --> 49:58.375
My saviour!

49:59.416 --> 50:01.582
- Please, please save me!
- Hello...?

50:01.625 --> 50:03.124
Quick! Quick!

50:10.583 --> 50:11.583
I...

50:12.416 --> 50:14.165
(RUS) I've never massaged a dog.

50:15.625 --> 50:16.625
Hugo...

50:18.166 --> 50:19.499
is suffering terribly.

50:20.666 --> 50:21.874
He's apathetic.

50:23.500 --> 50:24.500
No, I mean...

50:25.166 --> 50:26.332
Oh yes, I understand.

50:29.375 --> 50:30.957
Perhaps you could...

50:33.250 --> 50:34.250
rub his tummy?

50:35.958 --> 50:36.958
Rub his tummy?

50:43.958 --> 50:44.958
But wait.

50:45.625 --> 50:47.582
You're completely soaked.

50:49.500 --> 50:50.790
Please... Please...

50:50.875 --> 50:52.082
Please get undressed.

50:52.125 --> 50:53.332
Let's get this dry for you.

50:53.375 --> 50:54.851
- No, no...
- Oh yes, yes.

50:54.875 --> 50:55.875
I'll do it myself...

51:22.916 --> 51:24.124
He's let one fucking rip!

51:28.083 --> 51:29.457
Perhaps you are hungry?

51:29.500 --> 51:31.249
I could make Zhenia a sandwich?

51:33.208 --> 51:35.499
You're rather... skinny.

51:37.166 --> 51:38.415
We have to eat!

51:39.500 --> 51:41.415
A good appetite is a sign of health.

51:44.541 --> 51:47.249
You visit that man from No 33,

51:47.416 --> 51:49.934
you've seen what he looks like.

51:49.958 --> 51:52.957
Is it now trendy to starve yourself?

51:54.250 --> 51:55.457
Perhaps he's sick?

52:02.958 --> 52:05.332
- (RUS) - Cheers.
- Cheers.

52:09.916 --> 52:10.916
That's nice.

52:54.166 --> 52:55.767
I'll fuck those bastards up.

52:55.791 --> 52:57.040
I'll fuck them up!

52:58.875 --> 53:00.249
Fuck off out of here!

53:00.291 --> 53:02.082
Are you going to film me, huh?

53:02.125 --> 53:03.374
We have permission.

53:03.416 --> 53:05.476
I don't give a fuck about your permission.

53:05.500 --> 53:07.082
Fuck off out of here! Now!

53:08.125 --> 53:09.457
Fuck off out of here!

53:10.791 --> 53:12.726
- Please calm down.
- Calm down?

53:12.750 --> 53:14.226
- Put that rake down.
- Huh?

53:14.250 --> 53:16.101
- Wait till I whip your ass...
- Calm down.

53:16.125 --> 53:18.165
There's no way you're cutting them down!

53:18.583 --> 53:19.583
What, you bastard?

53:19.958 --> 53:20.958
- What?
- Calm down.

53:24.125 --> 53:25.125
Dicks.

53:26.541 --> 53:27.541
Get the fuck out.

53:28.250 --> 53:29.250
You too!

53:33.625 --> 53:35.624
I'm very upset today.

53:37.875 --> 53:38.875
Very.

53:41.416 --> 53:43.351
We're not going to do the massage today.

53:43.375 --> 53:45.207
I'll pay you, of course.

53:45.625 --> 53:46.832
The tree will grow back.

53:52.541 --> 53:54.290
My husband is buried there.

53:57.250 --> 53:59.624
I composted him illegally.

54:03.166 --> 54:04.874
You composted him?

54:05.958 --> 54:07.124
Compost.

54:08.750 --> 54:09.750
Fertilizer.

54:11.458 --> 54:13.749
His body is fertilizing the soil.

54:21.958 --> 54:24.165
Jan helped me. He knows about those things.

54:31.958 --> 54:35.082
Do you even understand the concept
of the afforestation of the Earth?

56:16.875 --> 56:17.875
How's it going?

56:30.791 --> 56:33.457
Does it last long? Does the high last long?

56:47.666 --> 56:49.601
Come to the little tree. Come.

56:49.625 --> 56:51.101
Come and help.

56:51.125 --> 56:52.226
Help daddy.

56:52.250 --> 56:53.790
Hold it. Hold it!

56:54.166 --> 56:55.457
Hold the little tree!

56:55.500 --> 56:56.874
Look how green it is!

56:56.916 --> 56:58.915
Look! Come here to daddy!

56:59.250 --> 57:00.582
Come on. Give me a hug!

57:01.666 --> 57:03.082
It's alive, you know?

57:03.125 --> 57:04.290
It's alive. Now shout!

57:10.791 --> 57:12.476
I was always scared of shouting.

57:12.500 --> 57:14.874
Don't be afraid to shout. Don't be afraid.

57:16.250 --> 57:17.374
Don't be afraid. Don't!

57:17.416 --> 57:19.124
Don't! Don't! Don't!

57:24.125 --> 57:25.457
Smell it! See?

57:28.166 --> 57:29.166
Alright then...

57:56.541 --> 57:57.832
Now we'll decorate it.

57:58.666 --> 58:00.290
Hold this! Hold it.

59:16.291 --> 59:17.582
Your husband left this.

59:26.125 --> 59:27.957
You don't fancy her, do you?

59:28.708 --> 59:29.708
Who?

59:30.708 --> 59:31.708
Vicky?

59:34.541 --> 59:37.457
I meant that drunk with the bulldogs.

59:38.916 --> 59:39.916
Oh, her.

59:40.416 --> 59:41.915
I was wet.

59:42.416 --> 59:43.416
She helped me.

59:44.291 --> 59:45.291
Oh.

59:49.375 --> 59:53.249
That Vicky is 10 years younger than me.
Would you believe it? She looks so old.

59:55.875 --> 59:56.957
(RUS) She's a good person.

59:59.833 --> 1:00:01.957
She's pretty.
I mean, I don't think so, but...

1:00:03.833 --> 1:00:05.165
Shame about her husband.

1:00:07.583 --> 1:00:08.957
Such a nice man.

1:00:15.083 --> 1:00:16.083
Come in

1:00:29.416 --> 1:00:31.249
Trick or treat!

1:00:57.125 --> 1:00:59.207
Trick or treat!

1:01:01.833 --> 1:01:03.249
I was thinking...

1:01:03.750 --> 1:01:04.750
That, um...

1:01:08.125 --> 1:01:10.790
That maybe we should give hypnosis a try?

1:02:48.791 --> 1:02:49.791
Mom...

1:02:54.416 --> 1:02:56.082
Mom, can you hear me?

1:04:07.875 --> 1:04:09.290
(RUS) Look into my eyes.

1:04:14.500 --> 1:04:16.665
(RUS) You are plunging deep into yourself.

1:04:19.708 --> 1:04:21.790
(RUS) You are plunging deep into yourself.

1:04:23.958 --> 1:04:25.165
(RUS) Close your eyes.

1:04:26.458 --> 1:04:27.957
(RUS) I'm starting to count.

1:04:30.375 --> 1:04:31.375
(RUS) One.

1:04:33.500 --> 1:04:34.500
(RUS) Two.

1:04:36.833 --> 1:04:37.833
(RUS) Three.

1:04:40.458 --> 1:04:41.458
(RUS) Four.

1:04:43.291 --> 1:04:44.291
(RUS) Five.

1:04:46.166 --> 1:04:47.166
(RUS) Six.

1:04:53.750 --> 1:04:54.750
I died.

1:05:09.083 --> 1:05:11.332
There's so much beauty in the world.

1:05:28.958 --> 1:05:30.249
So much beauty.

1:07:41.958 --> 1:07:44.665
(VIET) I heard it'll never snow again!

1:07:45.416 --> 1:07:47.249
(VIET) It'll never snow again!

1:07:48.333 --> 1:07:50.457
(VIET) I heard that too. But maybe it will.

1:08:36.083 --> 1:08:37.332
I find you attractive.

1:08:40.083 --> 1:08:44.249
And because you know my body, we can go
further than normal when it comes to sex.

1:11:53.125 --> 1:11:54.125
Hugo!

1:12:02.041 --> 1:12:03.041
Borys!

1:12:05.666 --> 1:12:06.666
Filip!

1:12:21.958 --> 1:12:23.332
My boys!

1:12:27.916 --> 1:12:28.916
Hugo!

1:12:37.583 --> 1:12:38.583
Hugo!

1:12:42.875 --> 1:12:43.957
Borys!

1:12:50.750 --> 1:12:51.750
Filip!

1:12:51.833 --> 1:12:53.540
Let go, Blanka.

1:12:55.958 --> 1:12:56.874
Come on.

1:12:56.916 --> 1:12:57.749
Go with Mom.

1:12:57.791 --> 1:12:58.791
Take that.

1:13:01.333 --> 1:13:03.207
You smell like a Christmas tree.

1:13:03.250 --> 1:13:04.540
Come on, Blanka darling.

1:13:05.166 --> 1:13:06.892
We'll be back after ten.

1:13:06.916 --> 1:13:08.392
You can heat up your dinner.

1:13:08.416 --> 1:13:09.416
Alright.

1:13:09.875 --> 1:13:11.726
It's a shame you're not going with us.

1:13:11.750 --> 1:13:13.582
I just don't have the strength.

1:13:14.750 --> 1:13:15.874
Goodbye, Zhenia.

1:13:16.333 --> 1:13:17.333
Goodbye.

1:13:29.250 --> 1:13:30.540
Right there, right there...

1:13:38.125 --> 1:13:40.332
Do you have a girlfriend, Zhenia?

1:13:40.958 --> 1:13:42.040
I don't have the time.

1:13:45.875 --> 1:13:47.249
You don't have the time...

1:13:52.541 --> 1:13:55.165
How do you deal with
that kind of stuff, then?

1:13:57.583 --> 1:14:00.624
You look like the kind of guy
who knows what he's doing.

1:14:01.833 --> 1:14:03.665
- Maybe.
- Yeah, maybe.

1:14:05.833 --> 1:14:08.832
Don't be shy! Tell me,
what kind of girls do you like Zhenia?

1:14:12.166 --> 1:14:14.290
Blondes, brunettes, eh?

1:14:16.500 --> 1:14:17.582
Zhenia...?

1:14:21.750 --> 1:14:24.351
Do you prefer fat girls or skinny ones?

1:14:24.375 --> 1:14:25.375
Eh?

1:14:28.958 --> 1:14:30.332
What turns you on, Zhenia?

1:14:31.041 --> 1:14:32.332
Come on, don't be shy.

1:14:33.625 --> 1:14:34.625
Zhenia?

1:14:35.750 --> 1:14:37.290
Ow, Zhenia!

1:14:46.416 --> 1:14:48.499
You're living the life, Zhenia.

1:14:50.750 --> 1:14:53.707
Make the most of it before you
have a family, pal, because

1:14:54.500 --> 1:14:56.332
it all gets complicated after that...

1:15:06.416 --> 1:15:07.957
Don't think bad of me, Zhenia.

1:15:11.250 --> 1:15:12.374
Don't think bad of me.

1:18:40.875 --> 1:18:41.875
Hi.

1:19:15.833 --> 1:19:17.457
Natural Remedies for Cancer

1:19:23.250 --> 1:19:26.665
I would like to tell my children
that I love them.

1:19:26.708 --> 1:19:29.874
I hope I'm 1020 years old when I die.

1:19:29.916 --> 1:19:33.457
Many years of life ahead.
Life is wonderful, Dad.

1:19:39.958 --> 1:19:41.415
Dad planted a tree?

1:19:43.541 --> 1:19:46.915
When it grows, you'll be able to
hang baubles on it for Christmas.

1:19:52.958 --> 1:19:55.207
Do you like playing football with your Dad?

1:19:57.500 --> 1:19:59.124
What's your favourite team?

1:20:01.541 --> 1:20:03.665
Mine is Shakhtar Donetsk.

1:20:44.541 --> 1:20:46.082
I know who you are, Sir.

1:21:00.875 --> 1:21:01.875
My husband

1:21:02.625 --> 1:21:03.625
died.

1:21:12.708 --> 1:21:14.624
I forgot to text you.

1:21:17.166 --> 1:21:18.166
I'm sorry.

1:21:29.958 --> 1:21:31.684
You don't have to come here anymore.

1:21:31.708 --> 1:21:33.290
There's no need for that.

1:21:36.041 --> 1:21:37.041
No need.

1:21:45.125 --> 1:21:46.125
No need.

1:22:23.875 --> 1:22:24.875
Hello.

1:22:26.333 --> 1:22:27.915
Sorry. I came to the wrong house.

1:22:27.958 --> 1:22:28.958
No, no.

1:22:29.666 --> 1:22:30.957
It was me who called you.

1:22:32.958 --> 1:22:33.958
Come in.

1:23:06.208 --> 1:23:07.208
It's cold in here.

1:23:08.208 --> 1:23:09.249
I never feel cold.

1:23:12.500 --> 1:23:14.540
I heard you have great abilities, Sir.

1:25:02.958 --> 1:25:03.958
(RUS) Hands up!

1:25:10.250 --> 1:25:11.915
Oh, no, no...

1:25:11.958 --> 1:25:13.124
(RUS) Take it easy.

1:25:19.958 --> 1:25:21.790
- (RUS) - Cheers.
- Cheers.

1:25:31.833 --> 1:25:33.040
(RUS) He should

1:25:33.875 --> 1:25:36.124
(RUS) ...take part...

1:25:36.958 --> 1:25:38.457
(RUS) in the Olympiad!

1:25:45.833 --> 1:25:46.957
(RUS) A sportsman!

1:25:47.875 --> 1:25:49.207
(RUS) Sportsman!

1:25:58.625 --> 1:25:59.625
And you...

1:26:00.250 --> 1:26:03.499
You're single, aren't you, Zhenia?

1:26:12.875 --> 1:26:14.332
(RUS) How lonely

1:26:14.875 --> 1:26:17.957
(RUS) is my path, far away from home

1:26:20.041 --> 1:26:25.624
(RUS) which I cannot see under the snow

1:26:28.083 --> 1:26:33.957
(RUS) How can I feel
the unease of foreign lands

1:26:35.875 --> 1:26:41.290
(RUS) If I can't even remember my own...

1:26:51.375 --> 1:26:52.957
(RUS) I'm a superhero!

1:26:58.666 --> 1:27:00.624
(RUS) I will save you all!

1:27:01.708 --> 1:27:02.708
(RUS) All of you!

1:28:17.458 --> 1:28:20.332
(RUS) Zhenia, I'm waiting for you...

1:28:44.416 --> 1:28:45.416
(RUS) Is anyone here?

1:29:09.750 --> 1:29:14.540
(RUS) After the explosion,
radioactive dust floated in the air.

1:29:16.041 --> 1:29:18.207
(RUS) You said it looked like snow.

1:29:20.041 --> 1:29:22.540
(RUS) Winter was your favourite season.

1:29:23.666 --> 1:29:27.665
(RUS) Oh, the magic of snow...
It falls silently,

1:29:28.541 --> 1:29:31.749
(RUS) and you will never find
two identical snowflakes.

1:29:32.958 --> 1:29:35.540
(RUS) When the world is tired,
and it wants to rest

1:29:36.166 --> 1:29:41.249
(RUS) the snow covers it like a blanket.

1:29:42.791 --> 1:29:46.332
(RUS) You believed the snow
had extraordinary powers

1:29:46.375 --> 1:29:48.457
(RUS) and that you were a superhero.

1:29:48.500 --> 1:29:52.249
(RUS) And that if you truly wanted
something, it was sure to happen.

1:29:53.833 --> 1:29:56.332
(RUS) You would repeat
that to me when I was ill.

1:29:57.833 --> 1:30:01.332
(RUS) You'd sit by my bed,
telling me not to be afraid.

1:30:02.208 --> 1:30:04.415
(RUS) 'Everything's going
to be alright, Mommy.'

1:30:05.500 --> 1:30:06.500
(RUS) 'Look...'

1:30:07.333 --> 1:30:10.499
(RUS) 'The flowers bloom,
but it's snowing'.

1:30:11.833 --> 1:30:13.957
(RUS) 'I'Il make you get better.'

1:30:16.083 --> 1:30:17.083
(RUS) Zhenia...

1:30:19.166 --> 1:30:20.290
(RUS) My son.

1:30:21.916 --> 1:30:22.957
(RUS) My little son.

1:32:50.916 --> 1:32:53.124
The school play was very important for him.

1:33:05.125 --> 1:33:06.125
It's too small.

1:33:07.583 --> 1:33:08.832
I'll have to adjust it.

1:37:27.583 --> 1:37:29.499
You won't like it, dear.

1:38:08.625 --> 1:38:09.790
Everyone can see.

1:38:38.166 --> 1:38:40.684
(FR) A big thank you
to the children from our school!

1:38:40.708 --> 1:38:42.582
(FR) You are wonderful! Bravo!

1:38:48.875 --> 1:38:51.290

this wonderful piece

1:38:51.333 --> 1:38:52.874

1:38:52.916 --> 1:38:55.249
(FR) Maestra - bravo!

1:39:05.166 --> 1:39:07.267
(FR) And now, time for a magical surprise

1:39:07.291 --> 1:39:09.082
(FR) prepared by Kacper's parents.

1:39:09.583 --> 1:39:12.040
(FR) As you know,
Kacper's daddy has left us.

1:39:12.458 --> 1:39:15.165
(FR) Luckily, we have found
a fantastic replacement.

1:39:15.500 --> 1:39:16.500
(FR) And so...

1:39:16.958 --> 1:39:18.415
(FR) fingers crossed.

1:39:19.416 --> 1:39:22.290
(FR) And let the magic begin!

1:43:27.958 --> 1:43:29.582
(FR) Stop the music!

1:43:33.708 --> 1:43:34.708
(FR) He's not there!

1:43:55.375 --> 1:43:57.165
(FR) Was he supposed to be there?

1:44:02.708 --> 1:44:03.708
(PL) He's not there!

1:44:05.750 --> 1:44:07.374
(FR) Take the chest... take the chest.

1:44:07.416 --> 1:44:08.874
(FR) Take it... take it.

1:44:09.875 --> 1:44:10.875
(FR) Take the chest.

1:44:36.333 --> 1:44:37.333
(FR) Madame...

1:45:17.666 --> 1:45:18.666
Where is he?

1:45:21.791 --> 1:45:23.415
What have you done with him?

1:46:53.583 --> 1:46:54.583
Good morning.

1:46:55.125 --> 1:46:56.125
Good morning.

We're from the Employment Office.

Department of Foreign Workers.

1:47:01.958 --> 1:47:03.457
Do you recognise this man?

1:47:09.458 --> 1:47:10.458
No.

1:47:10.666 --> 1:47:11.332
Are you sure?

1:47:11.666 --> 1:47:13.165
Please take a good look.

1:47:19.708 --> 1:47:21.665
I know that man!

1:47:22.875 --> 1:47:24.665
Blanka, what are you talking about?

1:47:24.708 --> 1:47:26.540
He's a superhero!

1:47:26.916 --> 1:47:30.540
Are you chasing him because you
want to remove his superpowers?

1:47:37.750 --> 1:47:38.750
Children!

1:47:41.500 --> 1:47:42.707
I'm sorry, goodbye.

1:47:58.791 --> 1:47:59.791
Gentlemen!

1:48:02.416 --> 1:48:03.416
Pardon me...

1:48:04.750 --> 1:48:06.582
Did that man do something bad?

1:48:27.625 --> 1:48:31.290
Here lies Marek Roznowski
