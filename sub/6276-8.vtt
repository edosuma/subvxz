00:12.375 --> 00:13.583
Previously on Ray Donovan...

00:13.667 --> 00:16.959
DEBRA: Yes, this is Debbie
Gerson from Paramount Pictures.

00:17.041 --> 00:17.917
I'm trying to reach
Mickey Donovan.

00:18.000 --> 00:19.709
Well, they say
write about what you know.

00:19.792 --> 00:21.875
I know two things:

00:21.959 --> 00:24.417
robbing banks
and fucking black chicks.

00:24.500 --> 00:26.208
Let's see where
that goes.

00:26.291 --> 00:27.917
Re-Kon!

00:28.000 --> 00:29.291
You know how long I've been
trying to sign this guy?

00:29.375 --> 00:30.333
And his little protégé--

00:30.417 --> 00:31.333
gonna be the black
Justin Bieber.

00:31.417 --> 00:33.500
Cookie!

00:33.583 --> 00:35.417
Boy, I love the way
you sing, my nigga.

00:35.500 --> 00:36.875
Thanks for these.

00:36.959 --> 00:38.333
You're supposed to be
home studying.

00:38.417 --> 00:39.083
Well, we celebrating.
Cookie's back.

00:39.166 --> 00:41.917
Back from where, fool?
Prison?

00:42.041 --> 00:43.125
You work with
Lee Drexler, right?

00:43.208 --> 00:44.959
Tell that nigga
he owe me a phone call.

00:45.041 --> 00:47.583
BRIDGET: I'm gonna keep
seeing him. You can't stop me.

00:47.667 --> 00:48.792
He's got some
dangerous friends, Bridg.

00:48.875 --> 00:49.792
It's not your world.

00:49.875 --> 00:53.291
Sully didn't die the way
the FBI said he did.

00:53.375 --> 00:55.375
I can't finish my book until
I know what really happened.

00:55.458 --> 00:57.750
You were right.
I've been lying to you.

00:57.834 --> 00:59.750
My father and I have been
working with the FBI.

00:59.834 --> 01:01.417
What about Sully's girlfriend?
Do you know where she is?

01:01.500 --> 01:03.834
We're not gonna allow Mr.
Donovan to answer that ques...

01:03.917 --> 01:04.583
MICKEY: She's in
witness protection.

01:04.667 --> 01:06.500
Claudette-- my one true love.

01:06.583 --> 01:07.959
She's married now;
she lives in Palm Springs

01:08.041 --> 01:09.959
with a big producer,
Allen Weisbrod.

01:10.041 --> 01:13.250
He's good to you?
Yes, he is.

01:13.333 --> 01:15.291
This woman's body was found
in the oil fields two days ago.

01:15.375 --> 01:16.959
Did you fuck her, Mick?
Yeah.

01:17.041 --> 01:17.625
But I didn't kill her.

01:17.709 --> 01:18.959
Sully did.

01:19.041 --> 01:20.250
You're not going anywhere.

01:20.333 --> 01:22.875
And you're not selling
that fucking gym, either.

01:22.959 --> 01:24.083
That's not a boxing gym;
that's a Laundromat.

01:24.166 --> 01:26.583
That's how he cleans
up all his cash.

01:26.667 --> 01:27.834
You lied to me.

01:27.917 --> 01:30.333
You made me a criminal
just like you.

01:30.417 --> 01:31.542
We got the house.

01:31.625 --> 01:32.750
RAY:
I'm glad you're happy.

01:32.834 --> 01:34.667
But you can't afford
the house in Trousdale.

01:34.750 --> 01:35.834
I want that house, Harriet.

01:35.917 --> 01:38.917
I've only had sex with one
person in the last 20 years.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.458
How much do we like
each other?

01:40.542 --> 01:42.333
ABBY (laughs):
A lot.

01:42.417 --> 01:44.542
Mom came home at
2:00 a.m. last night.

EZRA:
So how was your honeymoon, Lee?

03:29.041 --> 03:30.291
Lanai was fine, Ezra.

03:30.375 --> 03:33.125
Until I got back
and found out my partner

03:33.208 --> 03:34.959
spent the entire time I was away

03:35.041 --> 03:36.792
raising money
for a dead woman's hospital.

03:36.875 --> 03:38.250
A dead woman?

03:38.333 --> 03:40.208
Ruth was the love of my life.

03:40.291 --> 03:41.959
I thought we were a law firm,

03:42.041 --> 03:43.375
not a fucking
construction company.

03:43.458 --> 03:45.458
You're getting too old
for this, Ezra.

04:10.875 --> 04:14.333
Morning, counselor.

with two guys.

04:31.917 --> 04:33.000
Calm down, Lee.

04:33.083 --> 04:35.333
They're gonna kill me.

04:35.417 --> 04:37.667
If they were gonna kill you,
you'd already be dead.

04:37.750 --> 04:38.583

You just told me
to do this last night.

05:06.667 --> 05:07.625
I need it today.

05:07.709 --> 05:10.041
How am I supposed to do
good fucking work

05:10.125 --> 05:11.041
under these conditions, Ray?

05:11.125 --> 05:13.208
What if I wanted to give the gym
to my brother?

05:13.291 --> 05:16.417
Not the way we set it up.
You hear me?

05:16.500 --> 05:18.834
We could all go to jail.

05:36.750 --> 05:37.834
You okay?

05:37.917 --> 05:39.750
I'm fine, Daddy.

05:39.834 --> 05:43.083
Need anything?

No.

06:10.083 --> 06:12.000
Sorry.
I'm really nervous.

06:15.333 --> 06:18.375
Usually we meet up
in the room and fuck.

06:22.917 --> 06:24.375
Are you breaking up with me?

06:25.208 --> 06:27.542
No, I'm not
breaking up with you.

06:27.625 --> 06:30.333
I just need to know
if you're serious about this.

06:30.417 --> 06:31.333
If you're all in.

06:31.417 --> 06:34.166
I have a family.
It's complicated.

06:34.250 --> 06:37.125
I can't tell you if
I'm all in or not.

06:38.834 --> 06:40.291
I think I'm in love with you.

06:40.375 --> 06:43.166
That's got
to be enough.

06:43.250 --> 06:43.542
Take it or leave it.

06:45.667 --> 06:47.500
I'll take it.

06:52.500 --> 06:55.083

06:55.166 --> 06:57.625
Get in, Shawty.

paying you to do this?

07:27.125 --> 07:29.291
Why don't you shut the fuck up!

07:31.041 --> 07:32.375
You know what?

07:32.458 --> 07:33.959
I'm gonna call
the parole office,

07:34.041 --> 07:36.583
report your ass.

07:36.667 --> 07:38.166
I'll violate you so fast.

07:38.250 --> 07:40.583
Go ahead, call my office.

Report the dope yourself.

I just told a great producer
your pitch,

07:55.625 --> 07:57.208
and he wants to hear it
from you.

07:57.291 --> 07:58.375
Who's that?

07:58.458 --> 07:59.500
Jerry Weiss.

07:59.583 --> 08:00.250
He's one of the most important

08:00.333 --> 08:01.542
producers in Hollywood, Mickey.

08:01.625 --> 08:03.375
Jerry wants us
to come to his house.

08:03.458 --> 08:05.375
He's having a cocktail party.

08:05.458 --> 08:07.125
(quietly):
Paramount Pictures.

08:07.208 --> 08:08.083
I need you here to go over

08:08.166 --> 08:10.208
the pitch before we go.

08:10.291 --> 08:11.834
I'll be right there.

08:11.917 --> 08:13.750
You ain't going nowhere.

08:13.834 --> 08:15.917
Debbie, we have
a problem.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
You're gonna have
to come to me.

08:18.083 --> 08:21.583
Dick.

ABBY (recorded):
Hey, this is Abby Donovan.

08:32.166 --> 08:34.125
I can't answer your call.
Please leave a message.

RAY:
Hey.

08:42.834 --> 08:44.500
Did you read the article?

08:44.583 --> 08:45.542
Yeah.

08:45.625 --> 08:45.959
Did you like it?

08:46.041 --> 08:48.750
Yeah.

08:48.834 --> 08:49.291
Why didn't you call me?

08:49.375 --> 08:51.583
Sorry, I've been busy.

08:51.667 --> 08:53.667
Do you miss me?

08:53.750 --> 08:55.583
Yeah.

08:55.667 --> 08:57.083
You still want to fuck me?

08:57.166 --> 08:58.250
Of course.

08:58.333 --> 08:59.250
"Of course"?

08:59.333 --> 09:01.333
You know what, Ray?

09:01.417 --> 09:03.417
Call me when you give a fuck.

09:11.375 --> 09:13.792
Do you remember me?

09:13.875 --> 09:14.792
Mrs. Shaughnessy.

09:14.875 --> 09:16.500
Come in.

09:16.583 --> 09:17.625
I read your article
this morning.

09:17.709 --> 09:20.959
You never mentioned
my daughter Catherine.

09:21.041 --> 09:23.709
You just forgot her
like everybody else.

09:23.792 --> 09:25.959
I didn't forget.

09:26.041 --> 09:28.625
What did you find out
about my daughter?

09:30.792 --> 09:32.583
You should call the FBI.

09:32.667 --> 09:35.125
I have called the FBI
a hundred fucking times!

09:35.208 --> 09:37.417
They lie to me!

09:38.542 --> 09:42.959
I need to know
what happened to her.

09:49.792 --> 09:52.125
I think she's in
witness protection.

09:56.083 --> 09:57.375
Where did you hear that?

09:57.458 --> 09:59.834
I can't name my
source, but...

09:59.917 --> 10:02.458
That's a fucking lie.

10:03.959 --> 10:06.417
We had a deal.

10:06.500 --> 10:09.041
If she went into
witness protection,

10:09.125 --> 10:12.166
she was gonna send me
a postcard, and she never did.

10:12.250 --> 10:13.166
No, missy.

10:13.250 --> 10:14.500
She's dead.

10:23.083 --> 10:26.083
Asking if you
were all in--

10:26.166 --> 10:27.291
that was wrong.

10:27.375 --> 10:28.959
You think so?

10:29.041 --> 10:31.834
I do.

10:31.917 --> 10:33.500
I think it's sexy.

10:33.583 --> 10:34.834
No, you don't.

10:34.917 --> 10:36.542
Yes, I do.

10:36.625 --> 10:38.166
I really, really do.

10:38.667 --> 10:41.208
(camera clicking)

10:46.458 --> 10:50.500
(mutters in Hebrew)

10:50.583 --> 10:51.542
(sighs)

10:51.625 --> 10:53.792
The kid has a contract
with Re-Kon.

10:53.875 --> 10:54.750
It's binding!

10:54.834 --> 10:56.291
End of story!
Hey, hey, look.

10:56.375 --> 10:57.500
Ain't no need to be getting
all upset and shit, all right?

10:57.583 --> 10:59.709
Let's just keep it respectable.

10:59.792 --> 11:00.875
Respectable?

11:00.959 --> 11:03.667
You break into
my fucking house...

11:03.750 --> 11:05.125
Y'all want some more coffee?

11:05.208 --> 11:07.542
Stop offering people shit!

11:07.625 --> 11:08.750
This is a home invasion!

11:08.834 --> 11:11.417
COOKIE: This ain't
no goddamn home invasion.

11:11.500 --> 11:13.083
If you would've called me back,
I wouldn't be here.

11:15.500 --> 11:16.542
Ray Donovan.

11:16.625 --> 11:17.917
What's happening, fool?

11:20.166 --> 11:22.083
Put that away.

11:22.166 --> 11:23.500
This?

11:23.583 --> 11:24.917
Conversation piece is all.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.125
Put it away.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.917
You gonna take it from me, Ray?

11:34.500 --> 11:35.917
(chuckles)

11:36.000 --> 11:37.917
You're no fun.

11:38.000 --> 11:38.917
Get rid of them.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.667
Y'all heard the man.

11:40.750 --> 11:41.792
Fall back.

11:48.583 --> 11:51.041
What do you want, Cookie?

11:51.125 --> 11:52.792
Five years ago,

11:52.875 --> 11:54.208
before I went to Folsom,

11:54.291 --> 11:57.333
I gave Re-Kon the money
to start his label.

11:57.417 --> 11:58.625
$30,000.

11:58.709 --> 12:01.291
You had an oral
agreement-- no contract.

12:01.375 --> 12:02.917
You do know
what "contract" means,

12:03.000 --> 12:03.458
Mr. Straight Outta Compton?

12:03.542 --> 12:07.000
My money, my sweat,

12:07.083 --> 12:10.041
my risk on these motherfucking
streets is my contract.

12:10.125 --> 12:11.083
You didn't answer my question.

12:11.166 --> 12:13.959
Look, if I wanted to,
I can come up in here

12:14.041 --> 12:15.875
and take all of Re-Kon's shit,
but I won't.

12:15.959 --> 12:17.625
I just want the kid.

12:17.709 --> 12:18.834
Look, why don't we
just call Re-Kon's

12:18.917 --> 12:21.625
ho ass up here
and sort all this shit out?

12:21.709 --> 12:22.458
Re-Kon's not coming over.

12:22.542 --> 12:25.750
You deal with me.

12:25.834 --> 12:27.959
And nothing happens till
you get out of this house.

12:32.417 --> 12:33.667
Let's bounce.

12:33.750 --> 12:36.333
You heard him.
Get the fuck out.

12:36.417 --> 12:38.417
What the fuck

12:38.500 --> 12:40.750
is that on your neck?

12:40.834 --> 12:42.834
(chuckles): What is
that Frankenstein shit?

12:42.917 --> 12:43.875
Did you get a face-lift?

12:43.959 --> 12:45.750
No. I, uh, I cut
myself shaving.

12:45.834 --> 12:46.917
This man got a face-lift.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.333
Damn, look.
Let me see that shit.

12:48.417 --> 12:49.333
Cookie,

12:49.417 --> 12:51.667
time to go.

12:51.750 --> 12:53.709
How long is this gonna take?

12:53.792 --> 12:56.375
A few hours.

12:56.875 --> 12:58.959
All right, nigga.

13:01.291 --> 13:02.834
(door opens)

13:02.917 --> 13:06.041
(door closes)
Get Re-Kon
over here now.

13:08.834 --> 13:11.083
(moaning)

13:23.125 --> 13:24.792
Hey.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.875
(laughs)

13:41.834 --> 13:43.750
What?

13:43.834 --> 13:46.375
When we fuck...

13:46.458 --> 13:48.417
you always do it different.

13:48.959 --> 13:51.208
What does that mean?

13:51.291 --> 13:54.750
You don't just get off
on me, you...

13:56.208 --> 13:57.417
You always do different stuff.

13:57.500 --> 14:00.583
Is that a problem?

14:00.667 --> 14:03.041
No, it's good.

14:03.125 --> 14:04.542
Good.

14:08.166 --> 14:10.125
(cell phone chimes)

14:10.208 --> 14:12.959
No, don't take it.

14:14.333 --> 14:16.208
Oh, shit.

14:16.291 --> 14:16.875
Who is it?

14:16.959 --> 14:19.250
I got to call my daughter.

14:23.417 --> 14:25.917
(groans)

14:26.000 --> 14:27.959
(both sigh)

14:32.000 --> 14:33.166
(cell phone ringing)

14:35.208 --> 14:37.208
Hey, honey.
Where are you?

14:37.291 --> 14:39.375
I'm home, Mama.
Where are you?

14:39.458 --> 14:40.625
I'm running errands.

14:40.709 --> 14:41.458
Um... what's wrong?

14:41.542 --> 14:45.041
I don't feel so good.

14:45.125 --> 14:46.625
Oh, no.

14:48.500 --> 14:50.291
I'll come home now.

14:50.375 --> 14:52.458
No, you don't... you don't
have to come back home.

14:52.542 --> 14:54.500
I... I'm just
gonna go back to sleep.

14:54.583 --> 14:55.917
Are you sure?

14:56.000 --> 14:57.333
Yeah, Mama, I'm sure.

14:57.417 --> 14:59.917
Okay, honey. I'll see
you in a few hours.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.458
Okay.

15:05.250 --> 15:07.250
(sighs)

15:07.333 --> 15:08.792
I have kids.

15:08.875 --> 15:10.291
Does that bother you?

15:10.375 --> 15:11.750
No.

15:11.834 --> 15:13.208
I like kids.

15:13.291 --> 15:14.583
Liar.

15:14.667 --> 15:15.750
I do.

15:29.375 --> 15:31.333
(laughs)

15:31.417 --> 15:34.000
LENA:
Hey.

15:34.917 --> 15:37.250
(groans)
Here you go.

15:40.709 --> 15:42.709
She's fucking
somebody else.

15:42.792 --> 15:44.667
I can't tell him.
No, you have to tell him.

15:44.750 --> 15:46.083
No. Out of the question.

15:46.166 --> 15:49.333
Come on, Avi, you never
fucked a married woman?

15:49.417 --> 15:50.333
No.

15:50.417 --> 15:52.792
Well, you know I have.

15:52.875 --> 15:54.417
What do you care

15:54.500 --> 15:56.208
if she's fucking around?
She has every right.

15:56.291 --> 15:58.625
Ray's been fucking around
on her for years.
I can't tell him.

15:58.709 --> 16:00.583
Well, if you
don't tell him, I will.

16:03.500 --> 16:06.041
I'll kill the cop instead.

16:06.125 --> 16:09.208
The kid is mine--
his mama signed the papers.

16:09.291 --> 16:11.417
Did you take Cookie's
money or not?

16:11.500 --> 16:12.959
Fuck the money!

16:13.041 --> 16:14.417
It's about the kid!

16:14.500 --> 16:17.417
Doesn't matter, Re-Kon.
He's my son.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
I did every single thing
you asked me to do.

16:25.083 --> 16:29.083
I put him in school,
I got him a private tutor,

16:29.166 --> 16:30.417
kept him off drugs.

16:31.834 --> 16:34.875
All right, he smokes
a little weed.

16:34.959 --> 16:36.667
But every kid
in the world smokes weed.

16:36.750 --> 16:38.291
LEE:
Why are we even
talking about this?

16:38.375 --> 16:39.834
Cookie Brown has
no written contract.

16:39.917 --> 16:41.458
We're keeping the kid;
end of story.

16:41.542 --> 16:42.834
How are you
gonna protect him, Lee?

16:42.917 --> 16:44.000
Restraining order?

16:44.083 --> 16:45.250
We're talking
about Cookie Brown.

16:45.333 --> 16:47.000
What'd he go away for, Re-Kon?
Bottom line,

16:47.083 --> 16:48.917
Ray, you work for me.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.750
Do what I fucking tell you.
And you work for me.

16:50.834 --> 16:53.750
(sighs)
Ray's right.

16:53.834 --> 16:55.709
It's some street shit.

16:56.417 --> 16:58.875
I love that
little nigga.

16:58.959 --> 17:00.125
Cookie gonna fuck his head up.

17:02.709 --> 17:05.375
I'll talk to him.

17:05.458 --> 17:08.000
Try to make sure
Marvin's okay.

17:11.166 --> 17:13.542
What are you doing, Ray?

17:13.625 --> 17:15.750
That kid's worth millions.

17:15.834 --> 17:17.917
You don't fuck
with Cookie Brown, Lee.
Oh, yeah?

17:18.000 --> 17:20.917
You don't fuck with Lee Drexler.

17:21.000 --> 17:21.542
Don't put any ideas
in Re-Kon's head, all right?

17:21.625 --> 17:22.917
He's got to do this.

17:23.041 --> 17:25.834
And what the fuck
is with Ezra?

17:25.917 --> 17:26.959
His brain tumor back?

17:27.041 --> 17:30.834
You didn't know I knew
about that, huh?

17:45.583 --> 17:46.291
Debbie Gerson.
Paramount Pictures.

17:46.375 --> 17:48.458
I'm looking
for Mickey Donovan.

17:48.542 --> 17:51.000
I'm Ronald Keith,
Mickey's parole officer.

17:51.083 --> 17:53.917
He's not going anywhere
unless I say so.

17:54.834 --> 17:56.417
Wow. You're tough.

17:56.500 --> 17:57.792
So you really signed
Mickey Donovan

17:57.875 --> 17:59.291
to a movie contract?

17:59.375 --> 18:00.917
Yes.

18:03.166 --> 18:05.417
You ever consult on anything?

18:05.500 --> 18:07.792
Consult? How?

18:07.875 --> 18:09.291
Like, on a film set.

18:13.917 --> 18:15.875
You got a card?

18:15.959 --> 18:18.125
Mickey Donovan ain't going
nowhere with you today.

18:18.208 --> 18:19.500
$250 an hour--
unless, of course,

18:19.583 --> 18:20.959
you end up
giving us story ideas.

18:21.041 --> 18:23.834
Then it's
a whole other thing.
Oh, girl, come on.

18:23.917 --> 18:25.000
No, I'm serious.

18:25.083 --> 18:27.000
We use guys like you
all the time.

18:27.083 --> 18:28.375
You got a card?

18:35.750 --> 18:38.041
You met, huh?

18:38.125 --> 18:41.250
They already made a deal; you're
going to the party. (chuckles)

18:43.917 --> 18:45.208
Hi.

18:45.291 --> 18:47.375
I'm getting dressed.
You want to step outside?

18:52.166 --> 18:54.125
Did you get the loan?

18:54.208 --> 18:56.041
Yeah, I got it.

18:56.125 --> 18:58.375
But I hate the fucking
interest rate.

18:58.458 --> 18:59.875
I can do much better
if you just give me

18:59.959 --> 19:01.417
a little more...
This one's fine.

19:01.500 --> 19:03.375
Hey.

19:03.458 --> 19:05.959
Your brother sent
back his paychecks.

19:12.250 --> 19:14.500
MICKEY:
He comes out of the bank.

19:14.583 --> 19:17.083
A dozen cops are
shooting at him.
(imitates gunfire)

19:17.166 --> 19:18.750
Jumps in the car.

19:18.834 --> 19:20.291
Drives to Roxbury.

19:20.375 --> 19:23.834
There's a black Cadillac
parked behind the projects.

19:23.917 --> 19:26.166
He throws the bag

19:26.250 --> 19:28.250
with the cash in the trunk.

19:28.333 --> 19:30.208
Finds his girl.

19:30.291 --> 19:31.500
Kisses his baby boy good-bye.

19:33.333 --> 19:35.333
Gives her the
keys to the car.

19:35.417 --> 19:36.834
When he comes out,

19:36.917 --> 19:38.000
the cops are waiting for him--
he's fucked.

19:38.083 --> 19:40.625
They cuff him and take him away.

19:40.709 --> 19:43.959
His girl gets in the black
Cadillac with his baby,

19:44.041 --> 19:47.500
drives west toward
California.

19:50.375 --> 19:51.583
The end.

19:51.667 --> 19:53.417
(clicks tongue softly)

19:53.500 --> 19:54.917
That's great.
(laughs)

19:55.000 --> 19:57.917
That's beautiful, Mick.

20:01.333 --> 20:04.083
We're gonna make
three pictures together.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.667
We'll go
to Cannes in May

20:06.750 --> 20:07.417
and sell your
life rights.

20:11.291 --> 20:13.417
You know why
I like this story?

20:13.500 --> 20:15.208
It's about real men.

20:15.291 --> 20:17.542
Paul Newman,
Steve McQueen,

20:17.625 --> 20:18.959
Mitchum.

20:19.041 --> 20:21.709
They drank, they fucked.

20:21.792 --> 20:22.625
Like us.

20:22.709 --> 20:26.083
Not these fucking
teenage superheroes.

20:26.166 --> 20:28.125
These boys on
screen today

20:28.208 --> 20:30.875
couldn't find a clit
in a forest of clits.

20:32.250 --> 20:34.458
Mick, you with me?

20:34.542 --> 20:35.959
Oh. Oh, yeah.

20:36.041 --> 20:37.792
(chuckles)
Hundred percent.

20:39.667 --> 20:41.542
(hip-hop music playing)

20:47.750 --> 20:49.500
What are you doing here?

20:49.583 --> 20:51.125
Look, Terry,
I'm sorry.

20:51.208 --> 20:53.166
I shouldn't have lied to you.

20:55.375 --> 20:57.542
You make a good living here.

20:57.625 --> 21:00.250
You're happy.
What the fuck's the difference?

21:00.333 --> 21:03.500
Are you gonna stop using this
place as a front or not?

21:03.583 --> 21:05.000
I can't.

21:05.083 --> 21:07.000
Then get the fuck out.

21:21.667 --> 21:22.709
All right,

21:22.792 --> 21:23.834
this place is
closing early today.

21:23.917 --> 21:26.375
Everybody out.

21:27.583 --> 21:29.959
Everybody out!

21:30.041 --> 21:32.500
(ringtone playing)

21:40.917 --> 21:43.000
RAY:
You gonna be home later?

21:43.083 --> 21:44.208
What's that supposed to mean?

21:44.291 --> 21:46.583
I got something for you to sign.

21:54.417 --> 21:55.959
Bridge?

21:56.041 --> 21:58.792
I got that soup you like.

22:00.500 --> 22:03.458
(accompaniment
to "Sunny" playing)

22:05.709 --> 22:06.625
(ringtone playing)

22:10.917 --> 22:12.875
Hello?

22:12.959 --> 22:14.208
ABBY:
Where the hell are you?

22:14.291 --> 22:15.709
I'm out with Marvin.

22:15.792 --> 22:16.583
(exhales)

22:16.667 --> 22:19.250
What's that noise
in the background?

22:19.333 --> 22:20.583
It's music.

22:20.667 --> 22:22.583
We're at the studio;
we're recording.

22:22.667 --> 22:25.250
No, you're not. You're gonna
come home right now, young lady.

22:25.333 --> 22:27.125
No. I'm staying here.

22:27.208 --> 22:29.375
I'm doing something that I like
with somebody I love.

22:29.458 --> 22:30.750
Why can't you understand that?

22:30.834 --> 22:33.625
Bridge, honey...

22:38.500 --> 22:41.417
Let's run it
from the top?

22:41.500 --> 22:43.250
We're not waiting
on Re-Kon?

22:43.333 --> 22:44.375
No, I got this.

24:52.750 --> 24:54.875
Boss, I think you should

24:54.959 --> 24:56.917
Just show me

25:03.000 --> 25:05.750
I got these from our guy
in Internal Affairs.

25:07.000 --> 25:07.417
This guy Jim--

25:07.500 --> 25:10.583
he's in homicide.

25:10.667 --> 25:13.417
Did his patrol work
in the 77th Division.

25:13.500 --> 25:16.083
He was a finalist
for Medal of Valor.

25:16.166 --> 25:19.041
He's a good cop.

25:19.125 --> 25:19.542

The other pictures.

25:27.917 --> 25:29.375
No, boss.

25:29.458 --> 25:30.917
No other pictures.

25:40.291 --> 25:43.000

26:28.083 --> 26:30.041
No.

26:30.125 --> 26:31.583
Thanks, Lena.

26:31.667 --> 26:32.834
All right, come on.

26:36.959 --> 26:40.667
You got some emotional
motherfuckers working for you.

26:43.875 --> 26:46.667
I know you're probably thinking
I'm some type of pimp,

26:46.750 --> 26:49.917
coming after Re-Kon
because he's a bitch.

26:50.000 --> 26:51.333
But I ain't here
for no paycheck.

26:51.417 --> 26:55.166
Nobody pays to keep me in check.

26:55.250 --> 26:57.417
I want equity.

26:57.500 --> 27:00.291
I spoke to Re-Kon and Lee.

27:00.375 --> 27:02.542
You got the kid.

27:02.625 --> 27:04.125
Where you gonna
take him?

27:04.208 --> 27:06.500
Take him?
There's gonna
be hard feelings.

27:06.583 --> 27:08.875
I think you ought
to get him out of L.A.

27:08.959 --> 27:11.709
Who gives a fuck
about hard feelings?

27:15.417 --> 27:19.208

Oh. Motherfucker.

27:19.291 --> 27:21.166
You want to keep the kid
away from baby girl, huh?

27:21.250 --> 27:24.083
I get that.

27:24.166 --> 27:26.709
Like I said--
I'm a father, too.

27:26.792 --> 27:29.125
I get you, Ray Donovan.

27:29.208 --> 27:30.959
Ain't no problem.
South Beach it is.

27:38.709 --> 27:39.875
I got you the deal, Cookie.

27:42.125 --> 27:43.709
Now get the fuck out of here.

28:02.959 --> 28:05.917
Back in the day,
we only had one rule.

28:06.000 --> 28:09.750
You never rob
from each other.

28:09.834 --> 28:12.625
You always rob
from the Jews.

28:12.709 --> 28:14.125
Any of you Jewish?

28:14.208 --> 28:16.917
(chuckles)
Nah, there's
no Jews here.

28:19.375 --> 28:22.375
So, Mick, what would you
steal from my place?

28:24.291 --> 28:25.250
I would, uh...

28:25.333 --> 28:26.417
take your cash.

28:26.500 --> 28:29.834
Then I'd find
your safe.

28:29.917 --> 28:32.291
Then I'd crack it.

28:32.375 --> 28:33.500
You do got a safe, Jerry?

28:33.583 --> 28:34.834
Mm-hmm.

28:34.917 --> 28:36.834
Upstairs, behind the Monet.

28:37.917 --> 28:39.709
I wouldn't take
your fucking art.

28:39.792 --> 28:41.458
Too hard to fence.

28:41.542 --> 28:44.458
I'd take your cash and, uh...

28:46.959 --> 28:49.166
Yeah, stuff like this.

28:49.250 --> 28:50.625
You know how much
those are worth?

28:53.291 --> 28:54.458
50 bucks,

28:54.542 --> 28:57.667
all melted down.
$3,000.

28:58.667 --> 28:59.166
Per place setting.

28:59.250 --> 29:01.500
Whoa.

29:01.583 --> 29:05.291
(chuckles)
My fingers are itching.

29:05.375 --> 29:07.291

you old fuck.

Allan.

29:15.250 --> 29:16.667
What are you doing here?

29:16.750 --> 29:19.583

Friend.

That's enough.

31:30.375 --> 31:32.208

We're just
talking here.

31:34.667 --> 31:35.959

Okay. All right, Mick.
Time to go.

was that about?

31:56.875 --> 31:58.166
You fucking lied to me,
didn't you?

32:00.583 --> 32:02.625
What else isn't true
about the story you sold me?

32:02.709 --> 32:03.709
All of it?

32:03.792 --> 32:05.917
Part of it?

32:07.041 --> 32:07.625
Say something.

32:07.709 --> 32:09.917
Let it go, Kate.

32:10.000 --> 32:11.166
Let it go?

32:11.250 --> 32:12.917
Who the fuck do you think
you're talking to?

32:13.000 --> 32:14.500
Some L.A. piece-of-shit starlet?

32:14.583 --> 32:16.667
You got your story.

32:16.750 --> 32:19.625
If this story isn't true,
then I am destroyed, Ray.

32:19.709 --> 32:21.208
Don't you understand that?

32:21.291 --> 32:22.667
My reputation is on the line.
It's all I have.

32:22.750 --> 32:24.250
Don't you fucking get that?

32:25.500 --> 32:28.625

33:38.291 --> 33:41.208
I figured we'd meet
one of these days.

33:45.333 --> 33:47.166
You need to stop seeing my wife.

33:47.250 --> 33:48.750
That's up to her.

33:48.834 --> 33:49.125
No, it's not.

33:51.750 --> 33:53.000
You know I'm a cop.

33:53.083 --> 33:54.875
I don't give a fuck.

34:01.875 --> 34:04.000
Go ahead.

34:04.083 --> 34:05.291
Pull the fucking trigger.

34:29.667 --> 34:31.458
That thing with Allan?

34:31.542 --> 34:31.917
Don't worry about it.

34:32.000 --> 34:35.166
We had fun.

34:35.250 --> 34:38.458
Jerry gets it.
He knows who I am.

34:38.542 --> 34:40.875
You don't know what's gonna
happen, Mick, do you?

34:40.959 --> 34:43.542
Nothing's gonna happen, girlie.

34:45.083 --> 34:46.834
Don't be so dramatic.

34:46.917 --> 34:49.333
(phone rings)

34:49.417 --> 34:49.667
It's Jerry.

34:49.750 --> 34:52.000
Hon?

34:52.083 --> 34:53.291
Yeah, Jerry?

34:53.375 --> 34:54.959
Put me on the speaker.

34:55.041 --> 34:56.583
You're on.

34:56.667 --> 34:57.917
Mickey?

34:58.000 --> 34:58.667
Yeah?

34:58.750 --> 35:00.834
You're a great guy.

35:00.917 --> 35:02.458
I love you.

35:02.542 --> 35:03.834
But we got a problem.

35:03.917 --> 35:05.875
Allan?

35:05.959 --> 35:07.166
Allan.

35:07.250 --> 35:08.834
Sorry, Debra.

35:08.917 --> 35:10.750
But I can't make this movie.

35:13.166 --> 35:15.250
So what?

35:15.333 --> 35:17.000
He won't do it,
we'll get someone else.

35:17.083 --> 35:18.667
No one will fucking
touch it now, Mickey.

35:18.750 --> 35:21.583
(scoffs)

35:37.000 --> 35:39.917
You went to his house.

35:58.125 --> 36:02.083
What would I have seen if I had
taken pictures of you, Ray?

36:03.625 --> 36:06.583
How many fucking women
would there be?

36:18.333 --> 36:19.500
I need you
to sign these papers.

36:21.375 --> 36:22.834
What are they?

36:22.917 --> 36:24.250
Loan papers
for the new house.

36:24.333 --> 36:26.125
I don't want it anymore.

36:26.208 --> 36:27.250
Yes, you do.

36:29.166 --> 36:31.000
Don't you get it?

36:31.083 --> 36:33.667
I never wanted
that fucking house!

36:33.750 --> 36:36.917
All I ever wanted
was for you to look at me.

36:37.000 --> 36:37.917
But you can't.

36:38.000 --> 36:40.834
You can't look at me,
you can't talk to me.

36:40.917 --> 36:42.250
You can't share your pain
with me.

36:42.333 --> 36:43.500
Share my pain?

36:43.583 --> 36:44.959
What fucking good
is that gonna do you

36:45.041 --> 36:46.959
or anyone else
in this house?

36:47.041 --> 36:49.166
Sign the papers.

36:53.917 --> 36:55.709
It's too late, Ray.

36:55.792 --> 36:57.709
Sign the fucking papers.

37:05.333 --> 37:05.709
All right.
Fuck you.

37:05.792 --> 37:08.625
Fuck.

37:08.709 --> 37:10.333
(sighs)
Christ.

37:10.417 --> 37:12.458
Leave me alone.
Stay the fuck away from me.
Abs...

37:23.125 --> 37:25.250
(phone buzzing)

37:29.333 --> 37:30.875
Yeah. What is it?

37:30.959 --> 37:32.291
LEE:
We're keeping the kid.

37:32.375 --> 37:33.834
You're what?

37:33.917 --> 37:35.166
Yeah. I thought about it.

37:35.250 --> 37:37.125
We owe him money, and that's it.

37:37.208 --> 37:38.458
That's all we owe him.

37:38.542 --> 37:40.250
So I messengered a check
for $150,000.

37:40.333 --> 37:42.291
That's five times
his initial investment.

37:42.375 --> 37:44.291
Warren Buffett
wouldn't turn that down.

37:44.375 --> 37:45.959
You're making
a big mistake, Lee.

37:46.041 --> 37:47.208
I don't think so, Ray.

37:47.291 --> 37:49.834
I've had music clients
for 20 years.

37:49.917 --> 37:51.291
I understand black people.

37:51.375 --> 37:53.375
They're all about
the Benjamins, baby.

37:53.458 --> 37:55.583
If Cookie has a problem with us,
we'll see him in court.

38:12.083 --> 38:14.000
You think fucking this guy
is gonna make you feel better,

38:14.083 --> 38:15.625
but it won't.

38:19.458 --> 38:22.208
It feels pretty fucking
good right now, Ray.
