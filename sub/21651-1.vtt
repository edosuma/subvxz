01:54.134 --> 01:55.217
Watch your backs!

02:15.967 --> 02:18.551
When Mr Westicott fired you,
did he tell you why?

02:24.842 --> 02:26.592
He said his wife is afraid of me.

02:26.676 --> 02:28.259
Did you ever speak to his wife?

02:39.426 --> 02:40.467
I praise her.

02:40.759 --> 02:43.801
I tell her she has hips.
Good for many children.

02:45.092 --> 02:46.676
Large, like my best sheep.

02:48.967 --> 02:50.782
You told her this?

02:51.884 --> 02:54.342
Just tell him to not speak
to his boss's wife.

02:54.759 --> 02:58.259
<i>I'll straighten this out with Mr Westicott
and you can go to work tomorrow.</i>

02:58.551 --> 03:02.842
My cousin, he hates his new neighbours.
Egyptians. My age, mostly.

03:02.926 --> 03:05.592
Nine blokes in one flat. Nine.

03:06.967 --> 03:09.842
- Well, he should talk to his landlord.
- Yo, it's a council estate, innit?

03:10.634 --> 03:11.926
Housing office then.

03:12.092 --> 03:14.676
Yo. He already did that
and they sent Immigration round.

03:15.467 --> 03:16.509
And?

03:16.592 --> 03:18.717
And nothing. They were out that day.

03:22.051 --> 03:26.551
Ooh, la la. I've never been to
Paris before. Beautiful, no?

03:26.634 --> 03:30.009
- Yeah, it is. Will you put that down, please?
- Relax. I'm not gonna break it.

03:32.259 --> 03:33.426
Okay.

03:34.176 --> 03:35.551
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

03:35.842 --> 03:38.426
Your minicab licence, um, expires in a week.

03:38.801 --> 03:40.926
I need you to fill in this form for me.

03:51.384 --> 03:52.926
- Your tea is cold.
- Sorry I'm late.

03:53.009 --> 03:54.717
You get my email?

03:54.967 --> 03:56.676
Nice to see you too, Alice.

03:57.551 --> 03:59.801
How are the salt mines treating you?

04:01.592 --> 04:03.259
My email, Emily.

04:05.092 --> 04:07.301
MI5 raided the flat an hour ago.

04:07.801 --> 04:09.634
- And?
- Empty.

04:10.717 --> 04:12.842
Nine Egyptian nationals
cleared out this morning.

04:12.967 --> 04:14.051
Oh, Jesus Christ.

04:14.301 --> 04:16.051
We have a good lead, though.

04:16.134 --> 04:18.466
- Should have them in custody shortly.
- Shortly?

04:18.716 --> 04:22.467
- If these guys are who I think they are...
- But we don't know that yet, do we?

04:23.051 --> 04:25.342
But, as I said, the lead is solid.

04:28.842 --> 04:30.884
- You'll call me?
- Of course.

04:32.092 --> 04:34.759
- Soon as you have them.
- I promise.

04:36.676 --> 04:38.134
Hello, can I get...

04:39.551 --> 04:40.717
Henry, come.

04:50.759 --> 04:51.801
Emily?

04:51.884 --> 04:53.926
<i>CIA intel is always welcome, Alice,</i>

04:54.009 --> 04:55.551
<i>and your cover is brilliant.</i>

04:55.634 --> 04:56.801
<i>But those Egyptians...</i>

04:57.342 --> 05:00.051
- They're students.
- <i>Students? Really?</i>

05:00.217 --> 05:03.134
Yes. Undergrads at UCL. The past three years.

05:04.717 --> 05:06.926
Are you sure? They really fit the profile.

05:07.009 --> 05:08.217
<i>Complete background checks.</i>

05:08.301 --> 05:10.967
- They're absolutely clean.
- <i>Okay.</i>

05:11.551 --> 05:14.176
Well, thanks for looking into it.

07:15.509 --> 07:17.884
<i>Dogcatcher, Dogcatcher, engage now.</i>

07:18.009 --> 07:19.342
Copy that. We see him.

07:27.176 --> 07:28.551
Shut up!

07:30.217 --> 07:31.842
Stay down! Give me your hands.

07:51.051 --> 07:55.259
Jim McAllister. We'd flown him in from
Ramstein to interrogate a prisoner.

07:56.551 --> 07:58.759
St Thomas' Hospital is saying heart attack.

07:58.842 --> 08:00.509
Our own docs are en route, but...

08:00.634 --> 08:01.717
He's dead, right?

08:03.967 --> 08:05.009
Sir?

08:05.467 --> 08:08.842
Are we expecting that to change
between now and after lunch?

08:10.301 --> 08:11.926
I'm asking because my wife

08:12.009 --> 08:14.634
is sitting alone at Chez Francois
on our anniversary.

08:14.717 --> 08:15.801
Why was I called in?

08:16.217 --> 08:18.384
The prisoner McAllister
was supposed to unlock.

08:18.842 --> 08:21.342
He's a courier for Imam Yazid Khaleel.

08:22.092 --> 08:25.009
- Khaleel has prison time left.
- He got a new lawyer.

08:25.092 --> 08:26.634
Oh, how nice for him.

08:26.759 --> 08:30.092
The Brits have inner-circle assets
saying that he just gave a go order

08:30.176 --> 08:32.634
for an attack on
an American target in the UK.

08:33.051 --> 08:35.467
And we believe the courier
to be carrying it, sir.

08:36.384 --> 08:37.717
American target?

08:38.426 --> 08:39.509
All we have, sir.

08:39.842 --> 08:42.717
- Who is the go order for?
- David Mercer.

08:43.842 --> 08:48.259
Mercer? Trust-fund jihadi
of Bloomfield Hills.

08:48.551 --> 08:51.676
He goes by his conversion name now.
Mohammed al...

08:51.759 --> 08:55.551
Fuck his conversion name.
What is his connection with Khaleel?

08:56.051 --> 08:58.801
The imam's his spiritual authority.

08:58.884 --> 09:01.426
Mercer won't lift a finger
without Khaleel's blessing.

09:01.926 --> 09:03.634
Khaleel gives him credibility.

09:04.509 --> 09:09.426
One more thing, sir. The ordered attack...
It's thought to be biological.

09:17.384 --> 09:20.634
Send a car for my wife and flowers.

09:20.717 --> 09:24.801
And by flowers, I mean whatever it takes
to keep me off the couch tonight.

09:29.467 --> 09:30.967
Please, take a seat.

09:31.051 --> 09:33.134
- Thank you.
- Good evening.

09:33.551 --> 09:34.801
Mr Lasch, please.

09:34.884 --> 09:36.092
- Yes. Please, go through.
- Thank you.

09:36.467 --> 09:38.634
- Thank you.
- Hello, Al.

09:39.134 --> 09:40.926
So good to see you.

09:43.342 --> 09:45.342
- You look great.
- Thank you.

09:45.426 --> 09:47.217
So the bus driver says, "Lady, I'm sorry,

09:47.551 --> 09:49.926
"you cannot bring a live chicken on the bus."

09:50.134 --> 09:52.926
So she apologises, snaps its neck
and gets on.

09:56.467 --> 09:58.551
I've told this story before, okay?

09:58.634 --> 09:59.967
Just a few times.

10:00.134 --> 10:01.509
- But it keeps getting better.
- Mmm.

10:01.592 --> 10:02.676
The whole feather thing, that was new.

10:03.134 --> 10:04.676
Now you're picking on me.

10:05.301 --> 10:08.009
What is that? New toy from Langley?

10:08.717 --> 10:10.759
Dedicated sat feed of local intercepts.

10:11.259 --> 10:12.426
Here.

10:16.967 --> 10:19.926
- This is live?
- They're beta testing 'em.

10:21.842 --> 10:22.967
I want one.

10:23.551 --> 10:26.009
Come on back to the field
and I'll get you one.

10:26.092 --> 10:27.259
I'm not ready for that.

10:28.134 --> 10:29.967
- I lost my nose for it.
- Bullshit.

10:30.051 --> 10:31.592
You don't have the network you're used to.

10:31.676 --> 10:35.592
Community embed posts
in allied countries are dead zones.

10:36.676 --> 10:38.759
See, you don't do good with boredom.

10:39.634 --> 10:41.092
I can manage.

10:41.509 --> 10:44.884
All right, look, I'm an asshole.
But we need your skill sets.

10:44.967 --> 10:46.301
We need you on the front line.

10:46.384 --> 10:48.884
Last time I was there, 24 people died.

10:49.009 --> 10:51.092
Not everything is that bridge
in Paris, Alice.

10:53.801 --> 10:55.759
- So how is your divorce coming along?
- Okay.

10:55.842 --> 10:57.759
All right, we're gonna change the subject.

10:57.842 --> 11:00.092
Oh, people do that when they don't
wanna talk about something.

11:00.176 --> 11:02.092
It was not your fault.

11:03.301 --> 11:06.134
I was your chief back then. I know.

11:06.801 --> 11:08.842
It was not my fault but...

11:08.967 --> 11:10.801
If you want me to make peace
with losing people...

11:10.884 --> 11:12.676
I don't. I want you to make
peace with those you saved.

11:12.759 --> 11:18.134
No, it was me. I lost them, Eric. Not Agency.
Not Paris station. It was me.

11:18.217 --> 11:22.384
I was too slow and too late
and you're crazy to trust me with that again.

11:23.759 --> 11:26.801
I've got 30 years in the craft,
so do me a favour...

11:27.884 --> 11:30.051
Don't ask me to cover
what you can't bear to face.

11:30.926 --> 11:32.551
- I wasn't doing that.
- Yes, you were.

11:32.634 --> 11:35.051
It's understandable.
Nobody wants to face that pain again.

11:35.759 --> 11:37.426
Let the past go.

11:38.217 --> 11:40.717
Or it's gonna get in the way when it counts.

11:42.592 --> 11:43.676
Good night.

12:09.467 --> 12:13.217
Marburg virus is a Category A
bio-threat threat agent

12:13.301 --> 12:16.134
that may just trump Ebola
for the nightmare trophy.

12:16.217 --> 12:18.926
Intercepts are flagging Russia
as the most likely source.

12:19.384 --> 12:23.301
<i>The Soviets produced a weaponised strain
in the '80s called Variant K.</i>

12:23.384 --> 12:24.926
<i>It's on every jihadi's wish list.</i>

12:31.634 --> 12:33.176
And the courier?

12:33.342 --> 12:35.759
<i>We snatched him last night.
We have him waiting.</i>

12:37.676 --> 12:41.717
<i>It's not what he knows, sir.
It's that Mercer won't have met him yet.</i>

12:41.967 --> 12:44.676
The imam never uses the same courier twice.

12:44.884 --> 12:48.384
So if we crack the courier for any
recognition measures needed for the meet,

12:48.592 --> 12:50.551
switch him out with one of our guys,

12:50.634 --> 12:53.176
we can change the message to
whatever we want.

12:53.259 --> 12:54.926
And if Mercer buys it, he can shut him down.

12:55.467 --> 12:58.259
It was all going beautifully
until our interrogator's ticker gave out.

12:58.801 --> 13:02.801
Are you telling me we don't have
another interrogator in the UK?

13:02.884 --> 13:04.759
Our best people are in the sandbox.

13:04.842 --> 13:07.467
There is another case officer
with London station.

13:07.759 --> 13:09.509
Alice Racine. But...

13:09.717 --> 13:10.884
But what? Call her.

13:10.967 --> 13:13.676
Actually, sir,
she's had a rocky couple of years.

13:14.134 --> 13:15.592
Who's her COS?

13:15.842 --> 13:16.967
I am, sir.

13:17.801 --> 13:19.051
Background?

13:20.759 --> 13:22.884
Racine was a teen runaway.

13:23.301 --> 13:26.551
European born, her mother brought her
to the States when she was 12.

13:26.634 --> 13:29.634
A year later, Child Protective Services
found her on the street.

13:30.176 --> 13:32.342
Multiple foster homes. Six different schools.

13:32.426 --> 13:35.384
She broke her teacher's arm when she was 15.

13:35.467 --> 13:37.634
Suspected he was touching her classmates.

13:38.259 --> 13:41.634
- He was.
- Mmm. Born a bloodhound.

13:42.551 --> 13:45.134
The cops on her case got her
into the Police Athletic League.

13:45.217 --> 13:48.717
Three years later, she had a full
athletic scholarship to Northwestern.

13:48.801 --> 13:50.342
<i>Now we recruited her because she</i>

13:50.426 --> 13:54.467
<i>scored off the charts on the Kolbe Index
and Special Activities needed interrogators.</i>

13:54.676 --> 13:55.926
What's the rocky part?

13:56.301 --> 13:59.759
<i>The mastermind of the 2012
bridge bombing was her interrogation.</i>

14:00.551 --> 14:03.092
<i>She broke him, too late to stop it.</i>

14:03.717 --> 14:07.551
<i>The death toll was a fraction
of the 2015 attacks but she took it hard.</i>

14:10.967 --> 14:12.551
She tried to quit after that,
but her chief at the time

14:12.634 --> 14:15.134
talked both her and the agency
into a transfer

14:15.217 --> 14:17.759
to a cover job in East London
in a jihad-prominent community.

14:18.051 --> 14:19.509
Which is why we didn't consider her.

14:19.592 --> 14:21.467
It's been two years since
she's been in the booth,

14:21.551 --> 14:23.759
and just wasn't enough time
to knock the rust off.

14:23.967 --> 14:27.259
But given the circumstances,
do you have a better idea?

14:29.801 --> 14:30.926
Anyone?

14:39.301 --> 14:40.842
Alice?

14:40.926 --> 14:42.467
Frank Sutter, London station.

14:43.342 --> 14:44.717
Some good reading in there.

14:46.384 --> 14:47.509
Page 12.

15:18.009 --> 15:19.551
The courier's Moroccan.

15:19.634 --> 15:22.676
Some trips to Frankfurt in 2014
for terror training.

15:23.301 --> 15:27.801
The Germans picked him up once, but they
considered him low value and let him go.

15:28.301 --> 15:32.009
No English. Speaks tribal Moroccan Darija.

15:32.092 --> 15:33.676
I got an interpreter for you.

15:34.926 --> 15:37.551
He won't know the meet site
until Mercer pings him,

15:37.634 --> 15:39.926
so focus on getting the recognition protocol.

15:40.217 --> 15:42.259
That's what we're counting on from you.

15:43.092 --> 15:44.217
Problem?

15:44.926 --> 15:46.759
You do know my history, right?

15:46.926 --> 15:49.009
If you want me to say you
were HQ's first choice...

15:49.092 --> 15:50.384
I don't.

15:50.842 --> 15:52.926
That's the point, I don't wanna
be anyone's choice.

15:53.092 --> 15:54.676
Except that's not how it works, is it?

15:55.467 --> 15:57.092
You're being called up.

15:57.176 --> 16:00.467
Now your reluctance is noted,
but this is priority red.

16:00.717 --> 16:03.259
And the chief of Europe division
has made his call.

16:05.426 --> 16:06.967
It's not a request.

16:25.717 --> 16:27.051
All right.

16:41.426 --> 16:42.842
Can you make this thicker?

16:43.051 --> 16:44.842
The kind of file that says
that the US Government

16:44.926 --> 16:46.842
has been on your ass since you were a foetus.

16:47.967 --> 16:49.634
Of course. Get on that.

16:53.384 --> 16:54.801
And take the camera out.

16:55.801 --> 16:57.301
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

16:57.801 --> 16:59.176
It's a trust deterrent.

17:06.592 --> 17:09.384
Hello, Lateef. I'm Alice.

17:10.217 --> 17:11.509
English?

17:12.967 --> 17:14.009
<i>Alarabiyah?</i>

17:14.634 --> 17:15.675
<i>Deutsch?</i>

17:16.217 --> 17:18.134
How about your native Darija?

17:22.592 --> 17:26.842
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
I don't understand. I don't understand.

17:29.217 --> 17:30.467
I'll be back with an interpreter.

17:35.592 --> 17:37.759
You just responded to something
I said in English.

17:40.551 --> 17:41.759
Twice.

17:45.384 --> 17:46.592
Just get on with it.

17:49.592 --> 17:51.092
You can send your interpreter home.

17:51.592 --> 17:53.217
- He's British born.
- Oh.

17:54.009 --> 17:55.801
Can I have the key for his cuffs, please?

17:57.217 --> 17:58.551
What do your parents think of you?

17:59.717 --> 18:01.467
I don't know. Why don't you ask them?

18:17.134 --> 18:20.801
My mum died and my dad pissed off
when I was young.

18:25.592 --> 18:26.967
What were you doing in Frankfurt?

18:27.426 --> 18:30.176
- I was working for a charity.
- Hmm.

18:30.259 --> 18:31.717
Servants of God.

18:31.801 --> 18:33.467
Something wrong with the charities in the UK?

18:33.551 --> 18:37.009
No. God called me there.

18:37.092 --> 18:40.592
- Mmm.
- I found a pure Muslim life there.

18:44.092 --> 18:45.467
Lateef...

18:46.884 --> 18:48.967
...you still haven't asked me
why you're here.

18:49.592 --> 18:51.092
Yeah, tell me.

18:51.717 --> 18:54.717
When prisoners don't ask,
it's because they already know.

19:14.176 --> 19:16.967
He's just sitting in there, on his own.

19:25.134 --> 19:28.676
Time is not our friend right now.
Why don't you use it?

19:29.551 --> 19:30.801
I am using it.

19:34.217 --> 19:36.926
So this is what a pure
Muslim life looks like?

19:37.217 --> 19:41.592
No. This is not Islam. I would never do this.

19:43.051 --> 19:45.426
The news said that the engine caught fire.

19:45.509 --> 19:46.967
That made you angry, didn't it?

19:47.051 --> 19:48.676
- No.
- Not getting the credit.

19:48.759 --> 19:50.509
Wh... why would I be angry? No!

19:51.217 --> 19:52.634
Have you ever met this man?

19:54.801 --> 19:55.842
- No.
- No?

19:55.926 --> 19:57.009
No.

19:59.884 --> 20:01.426
He's an imam. So what?

20:02.176 --> 20:04.009
He was arrested yesterday.

20:04.092 --> 20:06.842
He's been charged with plotting
the Sea Empress attack.

20:08.884 --> 20:11.384
Three members of his mosque carried it out.

20:12.092 --> 20:14.592
- What's that gotta do with me?
- You tell me.

20:14.676 --> 20:15.759
Fine, nothing.

20:15.842 --> 20:18.926
You should know that we have two
other members of his mosque in custody.

20:19.342 --> 20:21.676
And like you, they learned
bombmaking in Frankfurt.

20:22.342 --> 20:23.551
Bombmaking? No. Not like me.

20:23.634 --> 20:26.134
And like you, they have a long,
dark plane ride in their future.

20:26.592 --> 20:28.759
That's their business. It's up to them.

20:28.842 --> 20:30.717
I don't know these people
you're talking about.

20:41.634 --> 20:44.342
Okay. Okay, listen. I can explain these.

20:44.426 --> 20:45.926
I know what you're thinking.
I can prove this.

20:46.051 --> 20:48.801
- Relax. Relax. We already know.
- Please.

20:49.134 --> 20:52.176
Your imam found out that Scotland Yard
had tied him to the Sea Empress

20:52.259 --> 20:54.801
- and he was sending you away.
- No, no, that's not what this is.

20:54.884 --> 20:56.842
Just like he was sending
your two friends away.

20:56.926 --> 20:59.176
No, I'm supposed to deliver
a message for him. That's all.

20:59.259 --> 21:00.842
- Good soldiers, all of you...
- No.

21:00.926 --> 21:03.301
...but disposable as Kleenex
for a man like Khaleel.

21:03.384 --> 21:05.384
No, no, no. You're not listening to me!

21:05.467 --> 21:08.134
I'm just supposed to deliver
a message for him, that's all!

21:08.301 --> 21:10.426
Okay, listen. Wait, I've... I've got proof.

21:10.509 --> 21:11.634
I can prove it.

21:19.676 --> 21:20.717
What proof?

21:23.592 --> 21:24.842
Now...

21:24.926 --> 21:27.926
If you talk to me,
I can guarantee your safety.

21:28.967 --> 21:30.384
What proof?

21:34.676 --> 21:37.426
I always go to the mosque
with my friend every Friday.

21:37.551 --> 21:39.634
And his uncle owns a Moroccan cafe.

21:39.717 --> 21:41.051
He said one day, "Oh, come along..."

21:42.217 --> 21:45.301
- This quote, it's a fatwa.
- Mmm-hmm.

21:46.842 --> 21:48.509
Sort of like a spoken rule.

21:49.509 --> 21:52.676
But a fatwa can be about anything,
not just jihad.

21:52.801 --> 21:55.676
Uh-huh. And this one by Ali
is all Lateef needs

21:55.759 --> 21:57.634
to verify his identity to Mercer?

21:57.717 --> 22:00.384
Mmm-hmm. Plus the collection it came from.

22:02.051 --> 22:03.467
What do you mean, collection?

22:04.009 --> 22:08.967
Well, many authors recorded Ali's
words, in different collections.

22:09.676 --> 22:12.134
Which collection matters,
especially to an imam.

22:12.967 --> 22:14.217
Well, I don't see that here.

22:14.384 --> 22:16.551
It's a quite famous one.
I'll write it down for you.

22:17.467 --> 22:18.926
Did he mention the meet?

22:19.217 --> 22:21.217
He hasn't got it yet. He'll get a text.

22:26.092 --> 22:27.426
Would you excuse me for a second?

22:28.259 --> 22:29.717
Important?

22:29.801 --> 22:31.551
Just my personal life.

22:40.426 --> 22:41.467
Alice, Ed Romley.

22:42.384 --> 22:44.176
Hey, sir, this is not a secure line.

22:44.426 --> 22:47.342
And under any other circumstances,
I wouldn't be using it.

22:47.426 --> 22:49.134
But we've been trying to reach you for hours.

22:49.551 --> 22:51.509
We need you for an emergency
assignment in London.

22:51.592 --> 22:52.634
We've got a prisoner waiting.

22:54.967 --> 22:56.634
Well, I'm already on it.

22:57.051 --> 22:58.842
<i>London station brought me in.</i>

22:59.676 --> 23:01.051
What the hell are you talking about?

23:01.717 --> 23:04.051
<i>We haven't informed London station.</i>

23:08.509 --> 23:10.051
Sir...

23:10.134 --> 23:11.301
Does your prisoner happen to be

23:11.384 --> 23:14.384
a 19-year-old British national
of Moroccan descent?

23:14.884 --> 23:15.926
<i>Yes.</i>

23:17.842 --> 23:19.467
<i>What the fuck is going on?</i>

23:21.884 --> 23:23.217
I'll call you back.

23:29.592 --> 23:30.634
Alice?

23:38.426 --> 23:40.342
We were talking about fatwa collections.

23:40.426 --> 23:42.717
About which one David Mercer is expecting.

23:43.842 --> 23:45.301
Can you write it down for me, please?

23:45.509 --> 23:46.551
Sure.

23:58.592 --> 24:01.009
Except, now, I'm wondering about something.

24:01.842 --> 24:03.092
Wondering what?

24:07.217 --> 24:09.301
That the kid gave it up too easily.

24:10.426 --> 24:11.884
They are trained to bait us.

24:14.051 --> 24:15.801
You think that's what he's doing?

24:17.676 --> 24:19.384
I just think I should, um...

24:19.801 --> 24:22.801
Run his story again and see if I can
produce any cracks.

24:27.051 --> 24:29.884
Unless you prefer they turn up
at your meet with Mercer.

24:31.842 --> 24:33.592
I'd prefer for you to hurry.

24:34.509 --> 24:35.842
We're on a serious clock here.

24:36.092 --> 24:37.717
I do understand that, sir.

24:44.426 --> 24:47.051
Lateef, I have a few more questions
about Frankfurt.

24:47.717 --> 24:49.676
Are you serious? You said we was done!

24:49.759 --> 24:50.801
You promised me!

24:50.926 --> 24:52.759
I want you to take a look at this photo.

24:55.717 --> 24:57.842
I've seen this on the TV. It's just a trick.

25:01.509 --> 25:03.551
Lateef, I need you to work with me.

25:05.759 --> 25:07.509
Look at this picture.

25:08.092 --> 25:10.426
Who's this man standing next to you, Lateef?

25:19.551 --> 25:21.134
Anwar Hammersmith

25:21.926 --> 25:23.176
I know him from school.

25:40.509 --> 25:42.217
What happened? Where did he go?

25:42.759 --> 25:43.801
Jesus Christ.

25:46.259 --> 25:48.842
He kicked me. He went out the window!

25:49.134 --> 25:50.342
He's fucking gone?

26:23.551 --> 26:24.592
Come out.

26:31.592 --> 26:32.634
Get behind me.

26:34.634 --> 26:35.926
Open the door.

26:38.592 --> 26:39.634
Stay behind me!

26:44.759 --> 26:46.759
- I've been shot!
- To the stairs!

26:48.759 --> 26:49.967
My leg!

26:53.717 --> 26:54.759
Come on.

26:55.759 --> 26:56.801
Come on, faster.

26:56.884 --> 26:58.384
- You said I'd be safe.
- Come on.

29:09.051 --> 29:10.217
Don't do that, Al.

29:10.301 --> 29:13.134
I think I've unlocked
a source for a terrorist.

29:13.217 --> 29:14.259
What?

29:14.342 --> 29:16.551
I gave critical intel to a stranger.

29:17.676 --> 29:19.176
He played me, Eric.

29:19.509 --> 29:22.217
He had today's control code.
Today's encryption key.

29:22.301 --> 29:24.467
Whoa, whoa, wait, just slow
down a second. Who?

29:24.759 --> 29:26.509
Frank Sutter.

29:26.592 --> 29:28.259
At least that's what he called himself.

29:28.842 --> 29:33.217
I thought he was with London station.
He asked me to interrogate a prisoner

29:33.301 --> 29:36.301
who was carrying a message
from Imam Khaleel to David Mercer.

29:36.467 --> 29:40.051
I was asked to acquire their
recognition protocol, which I did.

29:40.134 --> 29:41.259
And?

29:41.342 --> 29:42.676
Right after I broke him,

29:43.176 --> 29:45.301
- I get a call from headquarters...
- Shh. Sit down.

29:45.426 --> 29:47.259
...asking me to do exactly the same job.

29:47.384 --> 29:49.551
There's no Frank Sutter in London station.

29:49.759 --> 29:51.717
Let's... let's take care of this first.

29:52.592 --> 29:55.176
- Who is this guy, Sutter?
- I have no idea.

29:55.801 --> 29:58.926
And why did he hijack a CIA interrogation?

29:59.134 --> 30:01.009
For... for the protocol.

30:01.592 --> 30:04.551
Whoever has it can speak for the imam.
And change the message.

30:09.717 --> 30:10.759
<i>Sir...</i>

30:11.509 --> 30:14.342
<i>...does your prisoner happen
to be a 19-year-old</i>

30:14.426 --> 30:16.426
<i>British national of Moroccan descent?</i>

30:17.051 --> 30:20.009
<i>Yes. What the fuck is going on?</i>

30:21.301 --> 30:22.551
<i>I'll call you back.</i>

30:23.259 --> 30:25.384
- Ed?
- No further contact.

30:26.426 --> 30:28.801
How did she get to our prisoner?

30:29.259 --> 30:31.176
Our London unit's running that down.

30:31.676 --> 30:33.092
<i>They've traced the van.</i>

30:40.342 --> 30:41.426
Secure perimeter.

30:45.342 --> 30:46.717
All guardians down.

30:47.759 --> 30:51.342
VIP missing. Clean work. This was contracted.

30:54.009 --> 30:57.176
Our guys must have been hit straight
after they snatched the courier. He's gone.

31:08.176 --> 31:10.551
So, Sutter doesn't know the meet location.

31:11.176 --> 31:13.259
He's only got part of the protocol.

31:14.217 --> 31:17.342
Thank God I caught on before
I gave him everything.

31:18.426 --> 31:19.592
What's he missing?

31:20.842 --> 31:24.134
Enough. Or if he meets with Mercer,
he'll get blown.

31:24.509 --> 31:26.592
Langley's gonna wanna bring you in,
you know that.

31:27.467 --> 31:29.801
- Langley's been breached.
- Agreed.

31:30.134 --> 31:31.967
That's why you can't stay here.

31:32.634 --> 31:35.884
If there's inside involvement,
they're gonna connect us.

31:37.467 --> 31:41.092
Now you should change.
Laura's still got some clothes in the closet.

32:22.342 --> 32:24.426
Stay down. Come on, stay down.

32:33.176 --> 32:34.217
Oh, my God.

32:34.801 --> 32:37.509
- I'll carry you.
- No, I can't move. I can't move.

32:40.926 --> 32:42.717
105 Wildbriar.

32:45.217 --> 32:47.592
- What?
- 105 Wildbriar.

32:47.676 --> 32:48.967
Apartment 32.

32:49.051 --> 32:51.301
It's a flat I got for Laura
when we separated.

32:53.384 --> 32:56.592
There's a spare key in the hall
above the extinguishers.

32:57.634 --> 32:59.592
Go, she's not there. You need a safe house.

33:00.384 --> 33:01.884
Go! Go!

34:13.217 --> 34:15.842
The timer, the propellant and a micro fan.

34:16.217 --> 34:18.342
The propellant here contains the virus.

34:18.551 --> 34:22.634
The fan'll disperse it into a mist,
too fine to see or feel.

34:29.342 --> 34:31.759
A contained, crowded space is best.

34:32.676 --> 34:35.384
Now I've set the timer to activate in...

34:36.384 --> 34:37.717
...10 seconds.

34:38.592 --> 34:40.676
Once they're infected, it'll take a while.

34:41.176 --> 34:44.259
- If you wanna come back later, I can show...
- I'll take your word for it.

35:55.509 --> 35:56.551
Come on, get it.

35:59.217 --> 36:00.676
- Sorry, mate.
- Oh.

36:02.009 --> 36:03.051
Come on, let's go.

36:40.551 --> 36:41.592
Back inside.

36:43.009 --> 36:44.634
- Move!
- All right.

36:45.217 --> 36:47.134
Keep calm. No one has to get hurt.

36:48.676 --> 36:51.134
Let's not lose our heads.

36:52.092 --> 36:54.384
I'll just pop the telly
back over here, then, eh?

37:05.426 --> 37:09.551
Not that you'd care, but I only picked this
flat because your parking spot was empty.

37:11.192 --> 37:12.721
You're robbing it?

37:12.801 --> 37:16.301
Well, technically speaking, I haven't relieved
relieved you of anything just yet, have I?

37:16.676 --> 37:19.176
Sit down. Hands where I can see them.

37:19.884 --> 37:22.301
- So you can call the police?
- So you can not get shot.

37:23.967 --> 37:25.051
That's always nice.

37:26.301 --> 37:28.426
- There's nobody else here, love.
- Get up.

37:28.884 --> 37:30.592
- You just told me to sit down.
- Stand up!

37:31.009 --> 37:32.592
Yeah, standing.

37:33.467 --> 37:34.842
Into the bedroom.

37:34.926 --> 37:36.259
I like where this is going.

37:37.134 --> 37:39.467
- What have you got in mind?
- I'm gonna restrain you.

37:40.051 --> 37:41.092
My kinda girl.

37:42.051 --> 37:43.092
Put your rucksack on the bed.

37:45.009 --> 37:46.384
Sit down, by the machine.

37:47.801 --> 37:49.842
Lay down. Face the floor.

37:51.634 --> 37:52.842
Hands behind your back.

38:00.051 --> 38:01.384
There are other ways to get to know someone.

38:04.092 --> 38:05.176
Jack Alcott.

38:05.759 --> 38:06.801
And you are?

38:11.801 --> 38:14.926
Seriously, has someone broken your
heart recently?

38:16.176 --> 38:17.384
'Cause not all men are alike.

38:20.967 --> 38:22.009
Mmm.

39:30.801 --> 39:32.676
<i>May I have your control code, please?</i>

39:33.467 --> 39:36.717
Control code, zero, golf,
Charlie, four, four, two.

39:37.009 --> 39:40.259
Encryption key, alpha, November, alpha, nine.

39:40.592 --> 39:43.467
I need to speak
to my case officer, it's urgent.

39:46.092 --> 39:48.176
I've got Alice Racine on line six.

39:48.801 --> 39:50.259
About fucking time.

39:50.342 --> 39:51.884
The watch officer traced the call.

39:52.217 --> 39:54.217
Do we have an ETA on our grab team?

39:54.467 --> 39:56.759
The Brits had people closer.
We gave them the ball.

39:59.776 --> 40:03.092
Alice, Bob Hunter, Euro division chief.

40:03.176 --> 40:04.842
I'm here with Ed Romley.

40:04.926 --> 40:05.967
Where are you, Alice?

40:06.509 --> 40:09.967
On a landline, so let's presume
we all know the answer to that question.

40:10.301 --> 40:12.301
- <i>What's your status?</i>
- In danger.

40:12.759 --> 40:14.801
- Someone is hunting me.
- <i>Who?</i>

40:15.884 --> 40:18.384
Whoever had me interrogate your
prisoner at the hotel.

40:18.592 --> 40:20.467
- <i>Were you successful?</i>
- <i>Yes.</i>

40:20.551 --> 40:21.884
- <i>And the prisoner?</i>
- <i>Dead.</i>

40:22.717 --> 40:23.801
Eric Lasch too.

40:26.259 --> 40:27.634
Repeat that, please.

40:28.551 --> 40:29.801
Eric Lasch is dead.

40:32.509 --> 40:35.259
<i>After losing the kid at the hotel,
I went to his apartment.</i>

40:35.592 --> 40:36.634
And we were hit there.

40:38.051 --> 40:41.342
It's probably already been cleaned
but you should secure it as soon as possible.

40:42.926 --> 40:43.967
Sir...

40:44.342 --> 40:48.842
Frank Sutter, the man who contacted me...
They had yesterday's control codes.

40:49.926 --> 40:51.092
You've been penetrated.

40:54.384 --> 40:56.217
<i>I know you need to vet what I just told you.</i>

40:56.634 --> 40:59.259
And until you've done that
I'm to be considered a...

40:59.384 --> 41:01.217
No one's thinking that way here, Alice.

41:04.342 --> 41:05.509
No.

41:06.551 --> 41:07.634
Really?

41:07.842 --> 41:08.884
<i>Alice?</i>

41:11.509 --> 41:12.551
Did they get her?

41:13.217 --> 41:14.467
Find out.

41:21.926 --> 41:23.176
Stay out of trouble, Jack.

41:33.259 --> 41:34.717
Go, go, go, go!

41:45.592 --> 41:47.092
Can I see some ID, please?

41:52.467 --> 41:53.717
Guns on the table.

41:56.259 --> 41:57.301
Easy with that.

42:17.009 --> 42:18.676
Alpha five, target acquired.

42:51.301 --> 42:53.176
I'm so gonna regret this.

42:58.884 --> 43:00.676
<i>How the hell could you miss her?</i>

43:02.134 --> 43:04.092
Do you really want to go there?

43:10.884 --> 43:13.842
You ran an illegal op on my soil,

43:14.009 --> 43:16.551
and when it all goes sideways,
you come crying.

43:16.634 --> 43:18.426
- <i>Emily...</i>
- MI5's not your mother.

43:18.509 --> 43:21.551
<i>Yes, you're right.
Do you know how I know that, Emily?</i>

43:21.634 --> 43:25.509
Because my mother could have
handled the fucking grab!

43:28.801 --> 43:29.842
Racine had help.

43:30.551 --> 43:31.592
Who?

43:32.551 --> 43:33.717
We're working on it.

43:34.009 --> 43:35.176
Beautiful.

43:36.051 --> 43:37.426
<i>She's your stray, Bob.</i>

43:37.801 --> 43:39.926
<i>And it would have been helpful
if you'd brought us in sooner.</i>

43:40.009 --> 43:44.967
"Sooner" we couldn't reach her. "Sooner",
we thought we controlled her sooner.

43:45.134 --> 43:46.259
Oh, come on.

43:46.551 --> 43:48.092
You actually think she's turned?

43:48.384 --> 43:49.426
She called you.

43:50.176 --> 43:51.384
I'm aware of that.

43:52.259 --> 43:55.009
<i>By the way, has it been ruled out?</i>

43:55.134 --> 43:56.884
- What?
<i>- Her breach theory?</i>

43:57.801 --> 43:59.009
<i>We're working on it.</i>

43:59.676 --> 44:00.717
Beautiful.

44:01.717 --> 44:02.759
<i>Bye bye.</i>

44:17.634 --> 44:18.801
Morning, love.

44:32.842 --> 44:33.926
Why'd you help me?

44:34.551 --> 44:37.176
I wasn't gonna find any jewellery
and that TV was crap.

44:40.342 --> 44:41.717
I heard everything.

44:43.051 --> 44:44.967
Your little phone call. Bedside phone.

44:46.217 --> 44:47.301
You heard?

44:47.384 --> 44:50.676
Everything. Sounds like there's some
serious shit about to go down.

44:51.759 --> 44:53.342
I couldn't just leave you there, could I?

44:53.717 --> 44:56.009
Well, most people would have.

44:56.551 --> 44:59.676
Most people didn't lose their best mate
in the 7/7 Tube bombing.

45:01.467 --> 45:03.092
I'm sorry.

45:03.176 --> 45:04.592
Yeah, well, what're you gonna do?

45:09.676 --> 45:12.176
- So, who trained you?
- I play video games.

45:15.967 --> 45:19.717
Marines. Four tours. Iraq.

45:23.801 --> 45:28.301
Well, those were SCO19s that you messed with,

45:28.842 --> 45:31.259
which means that our governments
are already talking to each other.

45:31.342 --> 45:33.342
Oh, really? About what?

45:33.717 --> 45:34.884
It's classified.

45:37.134 --> 45:39.259
Didn't I just get you out of
a whole heap of trouble?

45:39.342 --> 45:40.426
You have my gratitude.

45:40.634 --> 45:42.842
I'll trade your goodwill and appreciation

45:42.926 --> 45:45.717
for what the fuck is going on in London
that involves the CIA,

45:45.842 --> 45:47.926
dead prisoners and a terror strike?

45:49.134 --> 45:50.176
Goodbye, Jack.

45:50.759 --> 45:53.092
Bad idea, shedding me. I heard too much.

45:55.051 --> 45:56.509
I'm an unknown variable now.

45:57.384 --> 45:59.801
Tactically, it's a no-brainer.

46:01.717 --> 46:02.926
You really want me around.

46:03.301 --> 46:04.342
I'm useful.

46:06.717 --> 46:07.759
And I like trouble.

46:14.634 --> 46:15.676
Goodbye.

46:16.467 --> 46:17.676
You're saying the stakes aren't high enough?

46:17.759 --> 46:18.842
Oh, they are high enough.

46:18.926 --> 46:20.092
Well, then.

46:22.176 --> 46:23.217
I can help you.

46:25.134 --> 46:26.801
I've had my troubles since the war.

46:28.926 --> 46:30.384
Clearly not so well-adjusted.

46:31.926 --> 46:35.467
But I'm combat tested, and right now...

46:37.426 --> 46:39.301
I'm thinking I'm the only friend you got.

46:44.259 --> 46:46.009
- Go home, Jack.
- I am home.

46:47.217 --> 46:48.759
Where the fuck are you? Any idea?

47:03.092 --> 47:04.634
- This is all of 'em?
- It is, yes.

47:04.717 --> 47:06.051
Sir. Sir.

47:06.134 --> 47:07.342
The kills were top-tier.

47:07.426 --> 47:11.384
Single shooter from 80 yards.
The rounds were armour piercing.

47:11.676 --> 47:14.384
- Lab in Bexley is running analysis.
- What's wrong with our lab?

47:14.467 --> 47:17.967
A pouch to DC delays us 12 hours,
and if the point is to clear Alice,

47:18.051 --> 47:19.092
then we can...

47:19.176 --> 47:21.676
She was the last person to see
the courier alive.

47:21.801 --> 47:24.717
And she's actively evading
a post-incident debrief.

47:24.801 --> 47:28.717
Until that changes, clearing her
is nowhere near the point.

47:37.759 --> 47:39.342
Here we are. This all right?

47:40.592 --> 47:42.509
- Thank you.
- That's £12.50, please.

47:52.759 --> 47:54.259
Hello, madame. Is Amjad home?

47:54.342 --> 47:55.509
There's no Amjad here.

47:55.592 --> 47:57.134
It's okay, Mum. It's okay.

47:57.634 --> 47:59.467
- She's a friend from the centre.
- Hey.

48:00.051 --> 48:01.301
- How are you?
- I'm good. You?

48:01.384 --> 48:03.134
Yeah, good. Hey, sweetie.

48:03.217 --> 48:07.301
Oh, wow. Look at you. You're so big now.

48:07.509 --> 48:09.426
- How old are you?
- Three.

48:09.509 --> 48:12.051
Oh. No wonder you're so heavy.

48:13.134 --> 48:15.926
- Where's your daddy?
- He's playing football. Amjad!

48:16.467 --> 48:18.051
- Hey!
- There he is.

48:19.134 --> 48:20.176
Sorry about my mum.

48:20.926 --> 48:22.259
She's visiting from Bristol.

48:22.967 --> 48:25.217
She's so paranoid,
always thinking it's Immigration.

48:26.051 --> 48:27.592
My brother got sent back last year.

48:27.926 --> 48:29.092
Yeah, I know.

48:30.092 --> 48:31.134
Who's that guy?

48:32.467 --> 48:33.676
He's okay.

48:34.842 --> 48:36.759
I heard that Egyptian thing
turned out to be nothing.

48:37.176 --> 48:38.426
Glad you told me though.

48:39.217 --> 48:40.259
So what's the deal today?

48:41.467 --> 48:42.509
Well...

48:50.717 --> 48:52.676
So he has friends inside Khaleel's mosque.

48:53.801 --> 48:54.842
He's handy.

49:00.634 --> 49:02.426
Hoxton High Street. Some Moroccan restaurant.

49:02.509 --> 49:04.467
The imam eats lunch there most days.

49:04.551 --> 49:05.634
I love a tagine.

49:05.717 --> 49:08.467
- Still time.
- Get the bus? Tube?

49:08.926 --> 49:10.426
The lady doesn't do public transport.

49:11.467 --> 49:12.801
What? I gotta d...

49:13.426 --> 49:14.884
One sec, let me just talk to them, yeah?

49:20.176 --> 49:21.759
I'm going now.

49:23.192 --> 49:24.734
I'll see you later, yeah.

49:24.842 --> 49:27.842
<i>Tuesday's American football
game at Wembley is sold out.</i>

49:27.926 --> 49:29.676
<i>And their many fans at home
couldn't be more excited.</i>

49:29.759 --> 49:31.467
<i>Many of them crossing the pond...</i>

49:32.134 --> 49:33.884
It's like rugby for hairdressers, mate.

49:33.967 --> 49:35.009
I don't know about you,

49:35.134 --> 49:38.617
but the last time I saw shoulder pads like
that was on reruns of <i>Dallas</i>.

49:38.701 --> 49:40.884
Now let's talk about
the beautiful game we call "soccer".

49:40.967 --> 49:43.634
Shut up, both of you. Faster, please.

49:49.467 --> 49:51.301
- Knowles here.
- <i>Emily, it's Alice.</i>

49:51.967 --> 49:53.926
Alice? Do you know where I've been all day?

49:54.092 --> 49:56.467
Whitehall, at the Cobra meeting.

49:56.551 --> 49:59.134
- Guessing my name came up, huh?
- More than once.

49:59.217 --> 50:00.884
<i>Well, don't believe everything you hear.</i>

50:00.967 --> 50:02.009
Oh, give me some credit.

50:02.092 --> 50:03.759
<i>Why do you think I'm calling you?</i>

50:03.842 --> 50:06.342
MI5's committing every available asset
to this.

50:06.676 --> 50:08.634
<i>All conceivable soft targets
are being assessed.</i>

50:08.717 --> 50:11.926
Well, there's no time for guessing.
I'm chasing a lead and I need your help.

50:12.259 --> 50:13.509
What do you have in mind?

50:13.592 --> 50:16.426
<i>The courier was waiting for a text
with the meet location.</i>

50:16.509 --> 50:18.176
<i>We need to find his phone.</i>

50:26.217 --> 50:27.551
Just the one, please.

50:29.176 --> 50:30.759
This way. Please.

50:32.301 --> 50:33.759
Am I all right here?

50:40.717 --> 50:43.342
Round guy, short beard. Prayer cap.

50:43.426 --> 50:45.551
If he comes out, watch which way he goes.

50:45.634 --> 50:46.884
Watch which way he goes. Got it.

50:46.967 --> 50:48.009
- Okay.
- Yeah.

50:52.176 --> 50:53.842
Hey, watch out, man.

51:00.759 --> 51:02.009
Mr Al-Hussein?

51:02.092 --> 51:03.176
Yes.

51:03.259 --> 51:05.676
I'm Alice from the Gold Crescent
Community Centre.

51:05.759 --> 51:08.884
Have you by any chance seen
Lateef el Hajjam recently?

51:08.967 --> 51:10.551
I believe you know him from the mosque.

51:11.801 --> 51:12.842
Lateef el Hajjam?

51:13.301 --> 51:16.717
I'm sad to say that, um, some of his
friends got into trouble with the police.

51:16.801 --> 51:18.176
Vandalism. Graffiti.

51:18.592 --> 51:19.842
And his name came up.

51:20.384 --> 51:21.551
That's terrible.

51:21.634 --> 51:23.717
We mentor troubled youth

51:23.801 --> 51:26.967
and we often act as an advocate
with the police in such matters.

51:27.051 --> 51:29.592
And, um, Lateef's mother asked for our help.

51:31.009 --> 51:33.634
- His mother, you say?
- That's right.

51:35.176 --> 51:36.634
His mother spoke to you?

51:37.051 --> 51:38.467
Yeah, just now.

51:38.884 --> 51:41.134
It's quite urgent that I find her son.

51:42.884 --> 51:45.092
- Will you excuse me a second?
- Sure.

51:52.634 --> 51:53.676
Thank you.

51:59.342 --> 52:01.551
Hey, it's me. We're on.

52:02.092 --> 52:03.342
Right.

52:15.426 --> 52:18.384
Eight outgoing calls from grid Q34.

52:19.009 --> 52:21.551
Seven of them listed. One pay-as-you-go.

52:21.634 --> 52:23.551
That's him. Find the phone he's calling.

52:24.842 --> 52:25.884
Triangulating.

52:26.801 --> 52:29.467
London. Grid Q22.

52:30.592 --> 52:31.842
Another no-contract phone.

52:32.842 --> 52:34.801
Stationary. Hackney.

52:35.467 --> 52:37.884
Either a car park or a car pound.

53:03.342 --> 53:04.384
Can I help you?

53:04.717 --> 53:06.801
- Yeah, I'm looking for the gents.
- Behind you.

53:07.134 --> 53:09.342
Silly me. I'm a head-banger.

53:17.592 --> 53:20.384
Now behave yourselves, all right?

53:21.051 --> 53:22.384
Both of you.

53:34.759 --> 53:35.801
CIA.

53:55.592 --> 53:56.342
This courier?

53:57.634 --> 53:58.717
Maybe he's not mine.

53:58.801 --> 54:02.342
Lateef el Hajjam. He carried
your instructions for David Mercer.

54:03.217 --> 54:05.176
Do you know an American named Sutter?

54:05.259 --> 54:06.342
No.

54:06.551 --> 54:07.926
He kidnapped Lateef.

54:08.009 --> 54:11.676
And he tricked me into getting him the
information he needed to gain Mercer's trust.

54:12.176 --> 54:13.551
A fatwa by Ali.

54:14.676 --> 54:16.634
- Sutter, was it?
- Mmm-hmm.

54:18.676 --> 54:21.092
Did he ask you to get my instructions
for Mercer?

54:21.551 --> 54:24.717
No. He just asked for the protocol.

54:25.592 --> 54:28.759
- He has his own messenger?
- Apparently, yes.

54:31.926 --> 54:32.967
What was yours?

54:34.717 --> 54:37.051
"My dearest brother in Islam,

54:37.426 --> 54:40.717
"look to the fatwa for guidance.

54:41.176 --> 54:45.592
"In Ali's wisdom, my wishes are clear."

54:47.217 --> 54:49.217
You remember it, don't you? The fatwa?

54:49.676 --> 54:52.676
"A person has no faith
if he has no patience."

54:55.092 --> 54:56.134
What's that?

54:57.301 --> 54:59.509
- A stand-down order?
- Uh-huh.

55:01.092 --> 55:02.967
You did not order an attack?

55:03.051 --> 55:04.092
You're shocked.

55:04.176 --> 55:06.926
- You're not known for your restraint.
- Neither is America.

55:07.009 --> 55:08.301
Not when threatened, no.

55:08.676 --> 55:10.051
Ah, so you know the feeling?

55:11.217 --> 55:12.634
Here's a hypothetical.

55:14.551 --> 55:16.467
Say an imam

55:16.551 --> 55:19.592
is sickened by what's happening
to his religion.

55:19.717 --> 55:24.134
Group after group hijacking it,
each more savage than the next.

55:24.509 --> 55:27.759
But, say, as a younger man,
his rage at the West consumed him.

55:27.842 --> 55:30.926
And for years, he was lost in the hate.

55:32.301 --> 55:34.384
But... He's done with that now?

55:35.259 --> 55:38.051
This made-up imam of yours?

55:38.801 --> 55:40.801
And, thus, his dilemma.

55:43.301 --> 55:48.759
If he walks away now, his influence ends.

55:49.259 --> 55:53.259
Mass killers seek this man's counsel.

55:53.634 --> 55:56.717
And, with a word, he stops them.

55:56.842 --> 55:58.259
But not this time.

55:58.342 --> 56:01.051
- Then next time.
- I'm not here for the next time.

56:01.717 --> 56:02.926
What's the target?

56:03.176 --> 56:06.259
- I don't know. Each link is separate.
- But the meet?

56:06.592 --> 56:08.301
At least you must know the meet?

56:08.384 --> 56:10.884
That rule is never broken, Alice.

56:12.092 --> 56:15.884
Mercer, when he's ready,
will contact my messenger.

56:15.967 --> 56:19.676
And we are all in God's hands then.

56:22.134 --> 56:24.342
I like to think we have a say.

56:28.884 --> 56:30.301
Where the hell is he?

56:34.676 --> 56:35.801
<i>Hello.</i>

56:35.884 --> 56:37.259
Hey, it's me. Where are you?

56:37.342 --> 56:40.009
<i>The other side of the park.
It's the tallest building.</i>

56:40.092 --> 56:41.551
<i>I followed your man here.</i>

56:51.926 --> 56:54.217
- Morning, ma'am. This way.
- Hiya.

56:54.509 --> 56:57.592
The moped was found abandoned
in a tunnel two nights ago.

57:13.217 --> 57:14.676
I didn't tell you to follow him.

57:14.759 --> 57:17.551
You didn't tell me not to. Flat 1906.

57:21.051 --> 57:23.217
- What?
- You stay here. And keep watch.

57:23.301 --> 57:24.717
You heard the lady.

57:25.634 --> 57:26.801
You're welcome.

57:30.176 --> 57:31.676
Any of you got a spare cigarette?
Got a spare one?

57:31.759 --> 57:33.634
- Yeah, 'course, bruv.
- Safe.

57:45.676 --> 57:47.051
Emily?

57:47.134 --> 57:49.092
<i>Turn around, Alice, we've got it.</i>

57:49.509 --> 57:51.634
- Come again?
<i>- We found the phone.</i>

57:51.926 --> 57:54.717
The courier's been pinged.
A coded sequence was sent through.

57:54.926 --> 57:56.259
We have the meet site.

57:56.634 --> 57:59.259
<i>Six o'clock. Brent Cross boathouse.</i>

57:59.342 --> 58:00.884
<i>Well done, Alice.</i>

58:07.051 --> 58:10.009
- So we're ditching this guy, then?
- We don't need him now.

58:11.176 --> 58:14.967
The meet is on. About three hours.
A boathouse in Brent Cross.

58:16.176 --> 58:18.676
- That's big news, right?
- Yeah

58:18.759 --> 58:22.759
I gotta say, this beats a sandstorm
in Helmand province, hands down.

58:25.926 --> 58:29.259
Helmand province? That's in Afghanistan?

58:29.842 --> 58:31.259
Hmm?

58:31.342 --> 58:32.926
You said you served in Iraq.

58:34.009 --> 58:37.426
Oh, I was on the ground in both wars.
I forget to mention it.

58:38.051 --> 58:39.092
Hmm.

58:40.342 --> 58:42.426
Soldiers don't forget their deployments.

58:43.217 --> 58:44.259
Who are you?

58:48.384 --> 58:49.967
You're joking, right?

58:54.759 --> 58:55.884
Jack Alcott.

58:56.426 --> 58:58.676
40 Commando Royal Marines,
Helmand Task Force.

59:00.342 --> 59:04.676
We forced a hardpoint for
three straight days in Operation Musa Qala.

59:06.259 --> 59:07.842
To you, I'm just another wrong'un.

59:08.967 --> 59:12.217
The nine JSOC operators that owe me
their lives...

59:12.301 --> 59:15.176
Well, they might disagree.

59:17.426 --> 59:18.592
Happy?

59:22.134 --> 59:23.176
What's next?

59:24.634 --> 59:25.676
Next...

59:26.342 --> 59:27.759
We part company.

59:28.051 --> 59:29.134
Alice...

59:30.176 --> 59:31.259
I am telling the truth.

59:33.426 --> 59:36.134
You're selling the truth. Face the wall.

59:40.717 --> 59:41.967
Get back inside!

01:00:03.967 --> 01:00:06.926
<i>About three hours.
A boathouse in Brent Cross.</i>

01:00:13.426 --> 01:00:14.634
Come on.

01:00:17.009 --> 01:00:19.509
Up we go. Up we go.

01:00:19.592 --> 01:00:21.717
All right, darling. All right.

01:00:27.217 --> 01:00:29.134
Helmand fucking Province.

01:00:30.217 --> 01:00:32.051
Always comes down to tradecraft, doesn't it?

01:00:32.884 --> 01:00:35.259
- Beware of the short-notice gigs.
- You too.

01:00:35.551 --> 01:00:36.759
No kidding.

01:00:37.009 --> 01:00:38.467
Shame it had to be you, really.

01:00:38.967 --> 01:00:40.259
- Why?
- 'Cause I like you.

01:00:41.384 --> 01:00:44.834
- Quite like to have had your back.
- It's never too late.

01:00:45.517 --> 01:00:48.301
To what? Run away together?

01:00:49.301 --> 01:00:51.009
Let you put a bullet in my back?

01:00:52.301 --> 01:00:56.926
No. Quick recce and scoot.
In and out, that's the job.

01:00:58.801 --> 01:01:02.009
- Mercer's recognition protocol?
- There you go.

01:01:02.926 --> 01:01:05.717
It'll go easy on us both
if you give it to me now.

01:01:07.009 --> 01:01:08.801
We both know it's never gonna happen.

01:01:09.259 --> 01:01:11.176
Well, we both know what happens if you don't.

01:01:13.217 --> 01:01:14.259
Come on.

01:01:15.259 --> 01:01:18.659
Do you really think I wanna bleed you out
in the car park? 'Cause I don't.

01:01:19.467 --> 01:01:21.142
But I will.

01:01:30.884 --> 01:01:34.342
Lovely dogs. What are they? Rottweilers?

01:02:06.259 --> 01:02:07.842
Motherfucker!

01:02:08.676 --> 01:02:09.801
Well played.

01:02:10.842 --> 01:02:13.467
Brought your fucking A-game, eh?

01:02:14.051 --> 01:02:15.676
You're not gonna make this easy, are you?

01:02:18.634 --> 01:02:21.051
I am definitely earning my keep today.

01:02:27.217 --> 01:02:29.342
Give me the fucking protocol, Alice!

01:02:36.259 --> 01:02:38.634
Oh, what a fucking shame.
In a different world...

01:02:39.259 --> 01:02:42.051
In a parallel fucking universe,
it doesn't come to this.

01:02:43.967 --> 01:02:45.426
But we live in this one.

01:02:53.467 --> 01:02:54.509
Fuck you!

01:03:01.217 --> 01:03:02.592
Cop a bit of this!

01:03:29.467 --> 01:03:30.634
<i>Knowles?</i>

01:03:30.717 --> 01:03:32.676
- Emily.
- Dr Adam Roizman, Public Health.

01:03:32.759 --> 01:03:34.259
We spoke on the phone.

01:03:34.342 --> 01:03:37.259
We were told Five's chasing
a threat and to loop you in on this.

01:03:38.051 --> 01:03:40.176
Now the mother rang 999.

01:03:40.884 --> 01:03:42.051
Frantic, as you can imagine.

01:03:44.426 --> 01:03:46.759
Thanks to her we were able to isolate
him quickly.

01:03:55.842 --> 01:03:57.051
Oh, God.

01:04:01.384 --> 01:04:03.592
<i>He responded positive to Marburg.</i>

01:04:03.676 --> 01:04:07.092
<i>Incubation was fast, so we're dealing
with a mutation, probably.</i>

01:04:07.176 --> 01:04:11.759
<i>Symptoms in adults, two to five days.
And in children, even faster.</i>

01:04:13.134 --> 01:04:16.467
Now, if this is Mercer,
and he got it from the Soviet stockpile

01:04:16.551 --> 01:04:19.592
then it's a virus designed to be sturdy.

01:04:19.676 --> 01:04:22.717
It will last between lab and host,

01:04:22.801 --> 01:04:27.134
which puts in play our worst fear,
aerosolised distribution.

01:04:28.717 --> 01:04:30.217
Alice? Are you listening?

01:04:35.759 --> 01:04:38.884
Five has no Arabic-speaking
18-year-olds on staff.

01:04:39.176 --> 01:04:41.176
By the time we could scramble one together...

01:04:41.259 --> 01:04:43.134
- He's a kid, Emily.
- Exactly.

01:04:43.217 --> 01:04:45.217
Khaleel's couriers are always kids.

01:04:45.926 --> 01:04:49.009
It's a good plan, Alice.
Mercer won't know he's ours.

01:04:49.676 --> 01:04:51.926
He'll deliver the original
stand-down message.

01:04:52.009 --> 01:04:54.509
Mercer will pull the plug
and we'll start making arrests.

01:04:55.926 --> 01:04:57.301
He's had no training.

01:04:58.009 --> 01:04:59.301
I recruited him.

01:05:00.259 --> 01:05:04.134
- If I knew it'd come to this...
- I know. But you didn't.

01:05:05.384 --> 01:05:06.801
And it has.

01:05:12.092 --> 01:05:13.301
Ah, this is sick.

01:05:13.384 --> 01:05:16.176
I can't wait to tell my mates about this,
and see the look on their faces.

01:05:16.384 --> 01:05:17.926
- You can't.
- Yeah, I know, I know, I know.

01:05:18.009 --> 01:05:19.467
I'm just saying,
this is like bad arse, isn't it?

01:05:19.967 --> 01:05:21.301
Well, can somebody take my picture with them?

01:05:21.384 --> 01:05:22.426
No.

01:05:23.092 --> 01:05:24.384
What's that, a HK?

01:05:24.467 --> 01:05:27.592
- Oh, my days, I thought you only used those...
- Hey, hey, hey. Focus.

01:05:29.467 --> 01:05:32.592
Let's run it again. I'm Mercer.

01:05:52.009 --> 01:05:53.134
Good.

01:05:53.217 --> 01:05:55.259
Good? That was perfect, man.

01:05:55.342 --> 01:05:56.509
Look, this guy's mine, baby.

01:05:56.759 --> 01:05:59.051
I got this. He's mine. I got this.

01:05:59.134 --> 01:06:02.842
We'll have three watchers on you,
with video feeds to the van.

01:06:04.342 --> 01:06:05.801
- What's that?
- It's an earpiece.

01:06:07.842 --> 01:06:09.092
So you can hear us.

01:06:09.801 --> 01:06:10.842
Okay?

01:06:12.217 --> 01:06:14.342
Okay, gentlemen.
We're going live in 30 minutes.

01:06:14.426 --> 01:06:15.634
How's the feed to HQ?

01:06:15.717 --> 01:06:16.759
- Fine.
- Good.

01:06:41.842 --> 01:06:44.634
- How are you doing out there, Amjad?
<i>- Cold.</i>

01:06:44.717 --> 01:06:46.551
<i>- When's something happening?</i>
- Anytime now.

01:06:46.634 --> 01:06:48.301
<i>Yeah, you can just say you don't know.</i>

01:06:49.301 --> 01:06:51.259
Alice, can I have a word?

01:06:59.842 --> 01:07:01.676
MI6 has a file on you, you know.

01:07:02.676 --> 01:07:04.717
I got a peek at our Cobra meeting.

01:07:05.509 --> 01:07:06.676
Something juicy?

01:07:07.592 --> 01:07:08.884
Other than Paris, you mean?

01:07:10.217 --> 01:07:11.759
The bridge bombing was tragic.

01:07:12.342 --> 01:07:15.301
Not just because Algerian terrorists
killed a lot of people that day.

01:07:15.384 --> 01:07:17.467
If there's something you wanna tell me,
Emily, just tell me.

01:07:17.551 --> 01:07:19.176
I am telling you.

01:07:24.467 --> 01:07:29.217
After the bombing,
France's DGSI launched an inquiry.

01:07:30.926 --> 01:07:32.259
A magistrate put the seal on it.

01:07:32.551 --> 01:07:35.051
There were leaks
that made it into MI6's report.

01:07:35.467 --> 01:07:36.509
Leaks saying what?

01:07:36.717 --> 01:07:39.259
Well, among other things,
there was a discrepancy.

01:07:40.092 --> 01:07:44.551
Between the time you broke the prisoner
and the time the French police were alerted.

01:07:45.759 --> 01:07:46.884
Do I have your attention?

01:07:48.176 --> 01:07:51.592
Ninety minutes.
More than enough time to stop the bombing.

01:07:53.676 --> 01:07:56.467
Someone at the CIA wanted it to happen.

01:07:58.301 --> 01:08:00.842
The French pressed Langley,
but they were unresponsive.

01:08:01.592 --> 01:08:03.342
Just as they were unresponsive when asked

01:08:03.426 --> 01:08:06.634
if a CIA employee was among those killed
on the bridge that day.

01:08:06.967 --> 01:08:08.676
<i>A whistleblower, it turns out.</i>

01:08:08.759 --> 01:08:11.467
<i>With access
to drone strike after-action reports.</i>

01:08:11.551 --> 01:08:14.676
He was about to reveal CIA's
mathematical inadequacies.

01:08:15.217 --> 01:08:17.341
- Make them public.
- Civilian deaths?

01:08:19.926 --> 01:08:22.384
The numbers were being slashed, routinely.

01:08:23.167 --> 01:08:24.634
Hundreds of reports altered.

01:08:26.091 --> 01:08:28.384
- Are you okay, Alice?
- Yeah.

01:08:29.426 --> 01:08:31.926
- Do you want to sit down?
- No, I don't want to sit down!

01:08:32.134 --> 01:08:34.591
I wanna know how good this intel is.

01:08:36.134 --> 01:08:37.426
Six trusts its source.

01:08:39.176 --> 01:08:40.259
I'm sorry.

01:08:41.176 --> 01:08:43.384
I can only imagine the burden
of those deaths,

01:08:44.759 --> 01:08:46.341
but it was never yours to carry.

01:09:02.426 --> 01:09:03.884
Prelim analysis is back.

01:09:03.966 --> 01:09:06.591
The kidnappers used an A300 Win Mag round

01:09:06.676 --> 01:09:11.051
fired from an AT308C sniper rifle
with suppressor.

01:09:11.466 --> 01:09:13.551
It's a speciality armament.
Very few produced.

01:09:13.634 --> 01:09:18.134
The manufacturer has an exclusive contract
with Britain's intelligence services.

01:09:18.216 --> 01:09:19.884
Are you saying that the shooter is English?

01:09:19.966 --> 01:09:22.759
No. He's saying start calling
their armouries now.

01:09:27.466 --> 01:09:28.551
Punch in on the dock.

01:09:29.009 --> 01:09:31.426
Watcher Two, go in on the dock times five.

01:09:32.591 --> 01:09:33.841
<i>Pan left then down.</i>

01:09:36.966 --> 01:09:38.634
There. You see that?

01:09:39.341 --> 01:09:40.759
It's the electrical line.

01:09:40.966 --> 01:09:42.801
Did your men sweep under the dock?

01:09:45.426 --> 01:09:46.966
Oh, Jesus, Emily.

01:09:47.259 --> 01:09:49.051
- That could be a det cord.
- Alice!

01:09:49.134 --> 01:09:50.176
Shit.

01:09:55.467 --> 01:09:58.592
Watcher team, be advised, there is a friendly
about to cross your perimeter.

01:09:58.676 --> 01:10:00.259
<i>I repeat, a friendly.</i>

01:10:10.426 --> 01:10:12.717
This is Commander MacPhee, MPS, London.

01:10:12.801 --> 01:10:14.967
You wanted a manifest check of my armoury?

01:10:15.092 --> 01:10:17.801
Er, yes, Commander. We were wondering
if you had some information...

01:10:17.884 --> 01:10:20.884
If I have any AT308 Charlie sniper rifles
currently in the field?

01:10:21.259 --> 01:10:23.092
Right. We have reason to believe that...

01:10:23.176 --> 01:10:24.259
<i>Just one.</i>

01:10:24.342 --> 01:10:28.884
<i>Checked out and properly signed for by
a 12-year veteran of the security service.</i>

01:10:28.967 --> 01:10:30.967
- MI5?
<i>- That's right. MI5.</i>

01:10:31.051 --> 01:10:32.092
Thank you, sir.

01:10:51.842 --> 01:10:54.301
<i>Watcher One, Eagle is not seeing you. Report.</i>

01:10:58.176 --> 01:11:00.551
Watcher One, Eagle is not seeing you. Report.

01:11:01.509 --> 01:11:03.634
Eagle, this is One. Checking my link.

01:11:10.676 --> 01:11:12.676
Jesus. What just happened?

01:11:18.926 --> 01:11:20.134
What's going on?

01:11:20.217 --> 01:11:22.426
Watcher Two, this is Eagle.
Check your link, please.

01:11:27.217 --> 01:11:28.342
Shit.

01:11:28.634 --> 01:11:31.592
Watcher team, this is Eagle. Report stat.

01:11:31.926 --> 01:11:33.051
<i>Watcher One, in position.</i>

01:11:33.134 --> 01:11:35.342
Watcher One, do you have eyes
on Watchers Two and Three?

01:11:35.884 --> 01:11:38.551
Affirmative. All's good here.

01:11:42.134 --> 01:11:43.801
It's clear.

01:11:43.884 --> 01:11:45.176
No device found.

01:11:58.467 --> 01:12:01.634
<i>Mercer is here. I'm going off radio.</i>

01:12:42.384 --> 01:12:43.509
- Yes.
<i>- Ed Romley.</i>

01:12:43.592 --> 01:12:45.842
Has a marksman named Wilson been
assigned to your command?

01:12:45.926 --> 01:12:47.259
- Why?
<i>- Because if he has,</i>

01:12:47.342 --> 01:12:48.426
<i>you've been compromised.</i>

01:12:50.592 --> 01:12:51.926
Abort! Abort!

01:13:12.551 --> 01:13:13.676
No, please, no.

01:13:19.217 --> 01:13:23.259
I got it. Right.
Sutter will meet you as arranged.

01:13:23.551 --> 01:13:26.384
The Edgewater at 7:00.
The riverboat restaurant.

01:13:27.267 --> 01:13:28.909
Thank you, sir.

01:13:37.592 --> 01:13:40.592
Come on. It's okay. You're okay.

01:14:18.217 --> 01:14:19.676
Alice!

01:16:20.634 --> 01:16:23.467
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
please present your bags to be checked</i>

01:16:23.551 --> 01:16:25.134
<i>on entry to the stadium.</i>

01:16:47.009 --> 01:16:48.259
You're late.

01:16:48.467 --> 01:16:49.884
Mercer was late.

01:16:50.551 --> 01:16:54.301
- He's been given the go order.
- I know. But we got a problem.

01:16:56.051 --> 01:16:58.301
<i>This is wrong. I can't do it.</i>

01:16:59.134 --> 01:17:02.009
- I can't do it.
- You must, my son.

01:17:02.426 --> 01:17:03.801
God has willed it.

01:17:03.884 --> 01:17:05.176
<i>But children too?</i>

01:17:05.634 --> 01:17:06.967
They have done nothing wrong.

01:17:07.217 --> 01:17:11.092
<i>Their fathers reject God.
And when they grow up, they will too.</i>

01:17:11.592 --> 01:17:13.842
- How do we know?
<i>- We have the imam's blessing.</i>

01:17:14.259 --> 01:17:15.676
Be strong, my son.

01:17:16.801 --> 01:17:18.092
Start the timers.

01:17:19.967 --> 01:17:22.759
This is wrong. I can't do it.

01:17:22.842 --> 01:17:26.301
- I got this.
- Whoa. I got somebody closer.

01:17:26.926 --> 01:17:29.676
<i>Start the timers, or you will
answer to Allah for all eternity!</i>

01:17:29.759 --> 01:17:33.801
Please. Please. I can't. I just...

01:17:53.301 --> 01:17:55.384
This is for your heavy work.

01:17:57.259 --> 01:17:58.634
Only for the Moroccan kid.

01:17:59.509 --> 01:18:00.676
We still owe you Racine.

01:18:01.467 --> 01:18:02.551
Why is that?

01:18:02.759 --> 01:18:04.134
Because they missed.

01:18:05.717 --> 01:18:09.217
- Hey, Al, we was in here talking about you.
- Shut up!

01:18:11.842 --> 01:18:13.592
So you still owe him, hmm?

01:18:14.259 --> 01:18:15.509
Here I am.

01:18:22.092 --> 01:18:23.801
You piece of shit.

01:18:24.634 --> 01:18:27.676
- Once the surprise wears off, Al...
- You played me.

01:18:29.301 --> 01:18:30.509
That will never wear off.

01:18:32.009 --> 01:18:34.759
- Get up.
- Or what?

01:18:41.342 --> 01:18:44.092
Or your next death won't be a staged one.

01:18:44.176 --> 01:18:45.217
Get up!

01:18:45.884 --> 01:18:47.426
On your feet.

01:18:51.467 --> 01:18:52.676
Tell me the target.

01:18:53.634 --> 01:18:54.926
Don't insult me.

01:18:59.259 --> 01:19:01.676
How did you know the imam was blocking
terror strikes?

01:19:03.176 --> 01:19:06.967
Because too many of his meetings had
had benign outcomes.

01:19:07.051 --> 01:19:10.551
- So you snatched his messenger?
- And teed up your entrance.

01:19:14.801 --> 01:19:17.759
It was a decent plan
till things went sideways.

01:19:20.884 --> 01:19:23.634
I'd been briefed, of course.
Knew you'd escaped the hotel.

01:19:24.009 --> 01:19:27.759
Knew I had incomplete information,
so I improvised.

01:19:31.134 --> 01:19:33.209
I'm getting too old for this shit.

01:19:34.759 --> 01:19:38.551
- And I put someone on you.
- Jack. He was good.

01:19:39.009 --> 01:19:42.217
- I have an eye for talent.
- Yeah. You mentored me.

01:19:42.301 --> 01:19:44.842
I trained you in the country's interest.

01:19:46.884 --> 01:19:48.092
I know about Paris.

01:19:49.051 --> 01:19:52.259
- What... What about Paris?
- Paris, you fuck!

01:20:02.176 --> 01:20:03.426
Traitors...

01:20:04.634 --> 01:20:05.884
Need to be taken out.

01:20:05.967 --> 01:20:08.759
Traitors? You murdered 24 people.

01:20:08.842 --> 01:20:11.009
An Algerian suicide bomber did.

01:20:11.092 --> 01:20:12.301
Six were children!

01:20:12.676 --> 01:20:14.842
He was a threat to national security!

01:20:14.926 --> 01:20:16.842
He was a fellow CIA officer.

01:20:17.592 --> 01:20:19.384
You ordered him to the bridge.

01:20:19.467 --> 01:20:21.217
A target I acquired for you.

01:20:24.051 --> 01:20:26.092
All this time you let me think...

01:20:26.176 --> 01:20:29.134
Haven't I always said to you, Al,
it wasn't your fault?

01:20:29.384 --> 01:20:31.134
I'm so stupid.

01:20:32.384 --> 01:20:33.717
That's why you chose me again.

01:20:33.884 --> 01:20:35.634
No, no, you're a clutch player, Al.

01:20:35.717 --> 01:20:39.301
And whenever it matters...
You sink that three-pointer.

01:20:41.009 --> 01:20:42.134
The target?

01:20:49.801 --> 01:20:51.384
I said, don't insult me.

01:20:51.676 --> 01:20:53.301
The fucking target, Eric!

01:21:21.384 --> 01:21:22.551
What's going on?

01:21:24.634 --> 01:21:26.926
- Who are you?
- Take a walk.

01:21:31.259 --> 01:21:32.592
Hey!

01:21:33.384 --> 01:21:34.884
Oi! Stop!

01:21:50.009 --> 01:21:51.551
<i>American football in London.</i>

01:21:51.634 --> 01:21:53.217
<i>We're an hour away from kick-off,</i>

01:21:53.301 --> 01:21:57.467
<i>but this sell-out crowd is already pouring
into the stadium for pre-game festivities.</i>

01:21:57.676 --> 01:21:59.301
<i>The atmosphere is electric, Terry.</i>

01:21:59.592 --> 01:22:02.467
<i>Could it be this American sport is finally
catching on globally?</i>

01:22:02.551 --> 01:22:05.426
<i>Even quite a few Yanks
crossed the pond for it.</i>

01:22:10.967 --> 01:22:14.009
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to London.</i>

01:22:14.176 --> 01:22:16.051
<i>Now put your hands together...</i>

01:22:34.259 --> 01:22:35.884
The timers are device-sensitive,

01:22:36.592 --> 01:22:39.384
so you can only arm
and disarm them from this.

01:22:40.759 --> 01:22:42.384
Once armed, you've got five minutes.

01:22:44.467 --> 01:22:48.092
- How are we looking now?
- You tell me, sir.

01:23:09.967 --> 01:23:11.634
The elevators are rigged.

01:23:23.509 --> 01:23:25.134
I'll wire you your money.

01:24:07.051 --> 01:24:09.801
Guess I'm getting a little slow
in my old age.

01:24:11.717 --> 01:24:13.759
I suppose that's loaded now?

01:24:13.842 --> 01:24:15.009
Uh-huh.

01:24:22.884 --> 01:24:24.092
Why are you doing this?

01:24:24.634 --> 01:24:28.301
Math. Lives lost versus lives saved.

01:24:28.592 --> 01:24:30.759
- That simple, huh?
- Always.

01:24:31.467 --> 01:24:34.051
Even if it takes going the extra distance.

01:24:35.009 --> 01:24:36.426
How far is that?

01:24:38.217 --> 01:24:39.551
Tell me how to stop it.

01:24:39.634 --> 01:24:41.592
You can't. It's a timed detonation.

01:24:47.217 --> 01:24:48.701
Attagirl.

01:24:49.342 --> 01:24:50.467
How many dead?

01:24:51.384 --> 01:24:53.051
Enough to get our attention.

01:24:53.134 --> 01:24:55.426
Global viruses are the biggest threat
to mankind

01:24:55.509 --> 01:24:57.259
and Washington is asleep, Al.

01:24:57.592 --> 01:24:58.926
It's an American affliction.

01:24:59.009 --> 01:25:02.384
You know, they truck-bombed
the World Trade Centre in '93,

01:25:02.467 --> 01:25:05.467
but it takes 9/11 to make an impression.

01:25:06.009 --> 01:25:10.759
Ebola hops across the Atlantic
but we ignored that warning too.

01:25:11.384 --> 01:25:13.634
Some kind of sick wake-up call?

01:25:13.759 --> 01:25:17.592
No. I'd call it a stress test
of America's bio defence.

01:25:17.676 --> 01:25:22.384
Those American guests next door
are gonna fly back to Oregon or to Oklahoma,

01:25:22.467 --> 01:25:24.301
each one of them a ticking bomb.

01:25:24.717 --> 01:25:29.801
And when they go off, Washington will
appreciate its staggering lack of preparation.

01:25:31.176 --> 01:25:32.426
And do what exactly?

01:25:33.009 --> 01:25:34.967
Legalise what's needed for the next time.

01:25:35.634 --> 01:25:37.967
Forced isolation of all contacts.

01:25:38.051 --> 01:25:40.759
Quarantine camps
and the troops to secure them.

01:25:40.842 --> 01:25:43.676
Real-time access to private medical records.

01:25:43.759 --> 01:25:46.467
You're talking about medical martial law.

01:25:46.551 --> 01:25:49.467
I'm talking about keeping up
with Mother Nature,

01:25:49.551 --> 01:25:53.176
with her speed, with the tricks that
she's learned over millions of years.

01:26:06.592 --> 01:26:07.801
Run, sir!

01:26:54.884 --> 01:26:56.342
How far, you ask?

01:26:59.551 --> 01:27:02.217
As far as it takes to protect my country.

01:28:17.967 --> 01:28:20.051
Officer Racine? For you.

01:28:31.717 --> 01:28:35.301
- Sir.
<i>- Lasch's car pinged a traffic camera.</i>

01:28:35.384 --> 01:28:37.426
<i>Our English friends looped us in.</i>

01:28:38.801 --> 01:28:41.051
- He had to be stopped.
- Yeah.

01:28:44.259 --> 01:28:45.551
So, um...

01:28:46.384 --> 01:28:48.134
I suppose you're gonna bring me in now.

01:28:48.217 --> 01:28:50.676
And I'd suppose you'd like an apology.

01:28:50.759 --> 01:28:54.926
Here's an idea, let's get both and get
to work. Mercer's gone to ground.

01:28:55.342 --> 01:28:58.134
<i>And I do not intend to let him stay there.</i>

01:28:59.092 --> 01:29:00.134
Do you?

01:29:03.009 --> 01:29:05.967
- Sir, do you still want me to...
- Answer the question, Alice.

01:29:10.092 --> 01:29:11.426
<i>Alice?</i>

01:29:13.551 --> 01:29:14.592
Yeah.

01:29:15.301 --> 01:29:18.884
Um... He'll escape to Syria.

01:29:19.509 --> 01:29:23.759
<i>Probably through Eastern Europe.
Network contacts will move him.</i>

01:29:23.842 --> 01:29:25.426
<i>Our thinking as well.</i>

01:29:26.301 --> 01:29:27.509
I'll be in touch.

01:31:47.342 --> 01:31:49.342
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:31:49.801 --> 01:31:53.301
We have time for a coffee.
There's a pastry shop by the river.

01:31:54.092 --> 01:31:55.842
Excellent strudel.

01:31:59.926 --> 01:32:01.301
Nice to have you back, Alice.

01:32:04.009 --> 01:32:05.467
Don't be a stranger.
