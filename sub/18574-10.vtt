Judy! Judy what are you doing?
Come on!

00:09.699 --> 00:11.586
I want to hear the music!

00:13.892 --> 00:15.907
You're going to get me in trouble.

00:16.036 --> 00:18.064
Everyone knows there are
ghosts in the hill.

00:18.204 --> 00:20.454
Wait! You'll hear it in a minute.

00:22.509 --> 00:23.630
That's ghosts.

00:23.696 --> 00:25.548
If you stay out here
listening to ghosts,

00:25.606 --> 00:27.657
they will come
out of the hill and eat you.

00:27.757 --> 00:29.025
They won't. They will.

00:29.108 --> 00:32.618
And I'll get the blame.
Now, come on.

00:39.028 --> 00:42.275
♪♪ Traditional Music...

00:42.528 --> 00:44.196
I can hear it.

00:45.953 --> 00:47.579
Judy! No!

00:47.994 --> 00:49.994
I'll put the story in
the stone.

00:50.212 --> 00:51.775
Judy!

00:52.368 --> 00:53.884
Put your name there.

01:45.274 --> 01:47.298
Oh, where are we now?

01:47.357 --> 01:50.540
Aberdeen, Scotland,
2nd century AD.

01:50.621 --> 01:53.181
You weren't complaining
when it was Mars, were you?

01:53.383 --> 01:55.798
So why is Scotland suddenly more
important

01:55.907 --> 01:58.278
than guarding the vault
and keeping your sacred oath?

01:58.389 --> 02:00.731
She thinks she knows more about
Romans than me.

02:00.841 --> 02:02.554
Oh, well that's explained
everything, thank you.

02:02.601 --> 02:05.458
You don't know more about the
Ninth Legion than me. You don't.

02:05.645 --> 02:09.152
I read the book. I loved the book.
I read everything...

02:09.207 --> 02:11.645
- They disappeared.
- Except they didn't.

02:11.740 --> 02:13.860
They were annihilated in battle.

02:13.929 --> 02:15.849
Then where's the big pile of bodies?

02:17.240 --> 02:18.514
So where's the Ninth Legion?

02:18.562 --> 02:20.882
If they'd left,
they should still be leaving.

02:20.945 --> 02:24.842
Can you see 5,000 Roman soldiers
marching south?

02:25.531 --> 02:27.725
Down there, by the river.

02:27.903 --> 02:29.983
They'd have followed the river,
that's what they did.

02:30.053 --> 02:33.373
There is so much that you don't
understand about Roman Britain.

02:33.719 --> 02:36.350
- I got an A star.
- "Got an A star."

02:36.426 --> 02:39.834
I've lived in Roman Britain.
Governed. Farmed.

02:39.942 --> 02:41.154
Juggled.

02:41.326 --> 02:43.545
And speaking as a former
vestal virgin, second class,

02:43.593 --> 02:44.807
- I can assure you.
- I bet you...

02:44.854 --> 02:47.591
..there's a Roman legion
down there.

02:47.758 --> 02:50.037
Hang on. Second class?

02:50.139 --> 02:52.193
Fine. You go and check the river.

02:52.241 --> 02:54.161
I'll go and find their last
battlefield.

02:54.288 --> 02:58.951
Fine. I'll meet you back here
with a Roman soldier.

02:59.018 --> 03:00.978
Yeah, but seriously - second class?

03:01.026 --> 03:03.318
Yeah, it's a long story. Come on.

03:25.145 --> 03:27.206
I honour you, Mother.

03:29.923 --> 03:31.579
I honour you.

03:33.340 --> 03:35.126
I honour all our dead.

03:36.779 --> 03:41.333
I honour you,
Father. I honour all our dead.

03:42.567 --> 03:46.114
I honour you, Mother.
I honour you, Father.

03:47.084 --> 03:49.364
I honour all our dead.

04:24.656 --> 04:27.536
5,000 Roman soldiers. Eyes peeled.

04:27.630 --> 04:30.265
they must have left some kind of
mark on the landscape.

04:30.426 --> 04:33.695
Burning huts, slaughtered locals,
sweetie wrappers.

04:34.930 --> 04:38.490
Dark! Dark!

04:38.630 --> 04:41.148
- Dark!
- Doctor..

04:42.140 --> 04:43.476
Dark! Doctor!

04:43.524 --> 04:47.656
Look, a stone cairn -
Pictish civilisation.

04:48.250 --> 04:49.250
The bird!

04:49.382 --> 04:50.765
What about it?

04:50.834 --> 04:52.546
It said "dark".

04:53.101 --> 04:54.562
Yes, well that's why we're hurrying,

04:54.610 --> 04:56.586
because there's not much light
at this time of day.

04:56.633 --> 04:57.769
But it talked!

04:57.850 --> 05:00.613
Well, of course it did. It's a crow.
All crows talk.

05:00.684 --> 05:02.855
They don't talk in the future.
Course they do.

05:02.967 --> 05:05.688
Human beings just stopped having
intelligent conversations with them.

05:05.747 --> 05:07.187
And they all took a bit of a huff.

05:07.476 --> 05:09.644
Crows in the future
are all in a huff?

05:09.804 --> 05:11.966
Course they are. Haven't you noticed
that noise they make?

05:12.013 --> 05:13.355
It's like a mass sulk.

05:13.444 --> 05:16.339
Come on. The sooner we get there,
the sooner we'll know the answer.

05:16.388 --> 05:21.738
- Yeah, I know, but...
- Picts, early Celts. Loved stone cairns.

05:22.132 --> 05:25.355
They built them under the ground
but close to the sky.

05:26.441 --> 05:29.511
They think they're doors
between worlds.

05:30.222 --> 05:32.347
Iron age churches.

05:33.566 --> 05:36.636
What do you always find
near churches?

05:36.809 --> 05:38.308
Women in hats.

05:38.395 --> 05:41.238
Exactly. Human settlement.

05:42.228 --> 05:44.402
It's all a bit damp, though,
isn't it?

05:46.830 --> 05:49.384
It's Scotland,
it's supposed to be damp.

05:51.907 --> 05:54.462
A Roman soldier!

05:55.125 --> 05:58.405
I wish I'd studied Latin
so you could understand me.

05:58.685 --> 06:00.165
I understand you.

06:00.259 --> 06:03.063
- Sorry, what?
- I understand you.

06:03.595 --> 06:07.032
But you're...
You're speaking English.

06:07.110 --> 06:09.618
- What's English?
- Er, what you're speaking in.

06:09.720 --> 06:12.321
- You're speaking Latin.
- I'm not.

06:12.438 --> 06:15.313
That's Latin.
You just said that in Latin.

06:17.049 --> 06:19.249
Ah! It's the Doctor!

06:19.390 --> 06:24.565
Or the TARDIS, or both.
Something, a telepathic link.

06:24.744 --> 06:28.111
Auto-translate. That's why everyone
in space speaks English.

06:28.198 --> 06:30.025
What on earth are you
talking about?

06:30.253 --> 06:32.330
Oh, my God, it even does lip-sync.

06:32.492 --> 06:34.775
- Who are you?
- I'm Bill.

06:37.795 --> 06:39.435
Are you from the Ninth Legion?

06:40.772 --> 06:41.928
Yes.

06:42.062 --> 06:45.249
Yes! Where have you been?

06:45.428 --> 06:48.631
- Don't you know?
- Know what?

06:50.347 --> 06:52.267
Did you see what happened to us?

06:57.669 --> 07:00.444
It's as if his bones
have disintegrated.

07:01.350 --> 07:02.842
But what could do that?

07:03.018 --> 07:06.155
A complete and total absence of
any kind of sunlight.

07:07.156 --> 07:08.676
Death by Scotland.

07:10.910 --> 07:13.600
No. No. It should take decades.

07:13.764 --> 07:15.733
This happened a short while ago.

07:17.743 --> 07:18.818
This is alien.

07:18.978 --> 07:21.686
Right. Good-oh.

07:21.990 --> 07:25.303
Question is,
where are the rest of them?

07:27.115 --> 07:28.967
Just want to go back to bed.

07:34.009 --> 07:37.889
Well, there they are.
The Ninth Legion.

07:40.512 --> 07:42.312
Great big pile of bodies.

07:43.917 --> 07:45.855
It's not always fun to be right.

07:46.150 --> 07:49.020
This wasn't long ago.
Whatever did it is close by.

07:49.137 --> 07:53.316
- We need to find Bill.
- Don't move! Stay where you are!

08:10.648 --> 08:14.375
The Barbarians dug these traps
everywhere.

08:23.508 --> 08:25.860
- What was that?
- It's what slaughtered the Ninth.

08:30.030 --> 08:31.647
Can you see it?

08:32.443 --> 08:36.061
They attacked us with a...
A thing. A monster.

08:43.994 --> 08:45.514
There's nothing here.

08:47.365 --> 08:49.522
I've got to go back to the others.

08:49.798 --> 08:51.225
You said they were wiped out.

08:51.345 --> 08:54.748
There are survivors, a handful.
I can't leave them.

08:54.895 --> 08:59.303
Course not. We found a hiding place.
We might still be safe there.

09:03.475 --> 09:06.162
- So what was it like, this monster?
- I don't know.

09:06.245 --> 09:10.100
We deserted. We were the ones
who couldn't face it.

09:10.911 --> 09:15.053
Roman soldiers don't run,
and we did.

09:15.790 --> 09:17.030
What?

09:22.407 --> 09:25.280
They're underground, by the river.
There's a carving of a fish.

09:25.376 --> 09:27.428
Is that it? The monster?

09:31.702 --> 09:33.062
No!

10:08.415 --> 10:11.906
Block the entrance!
Quickly, hurry up!

10:22.421 --> 10:25.085
- How long will that hold?
- Not for long.

10:25.390 --> 10:29.230
Now bring her through,
where we can have a better look at her.

10:41.659 --> 10:44.588
You do realise the beast now
knows where we are?

10:48.508 --> 10:50.915
- You're not one of the barbarians.
- No.

10:52.049 --> 10:55.813
- So, you're the Ninth Legion?
- We are what's left.

10:55.921 --> 10:57.023
Simon should be back.

10:57.110 --> 11:00.297
He was looking for the road.
Our route south. Did you see him?

11:00.630 --> 11:03.230
- Yeah.
- Well, where is he?

11:08.553 --> 11:11.178
I'm sorry.
That creature killed him.

11:12.357 --> 11:14.287
What is it?
That thing, where did it come from?

11:14.335 --> 11:15.349
It killed him?

11:15.397 --> 11:20.256
Yeah. He was covered in this,
like... black slime.

11:20.975 --> 11:23.803
It knows where we are,
and we'll all die here, in the dark.

11:23.851 --> 11:26.038
No-one is going to die!

11:31.912 --> 11:33.237
Oh, for heaven's sake.

11:33.317 --> 11:34.998
How long are you going to
keep us here?

11:35.626 --> 11:39.194
Couldn't we have seats?
What about the Wi-Fi code, how about that?

11:39.311 --> 11:43.100
Don't move. Don't speak.
Kar will be here soon.

11:43.248 --> 11:44.248
Who's Kar?

11:44.343 --> 11:46.903
The keeper of the gate. My sister.

11:47.170 --> 11:50.014
Well, let's hope she's the brains of
the family, because there's

11:50.062 --> 11:51.936
a big bad wolf of a monster

11:51.984 --> 11:53.772
out there and you live in
a house of sticks.

11:53.826 --> 11:55.381
Nice here, isn't it?

11:55.462 --> 11:58.897
Yeah, yeah, I like what you've
done with the place. Yeah.

11:59.131 --> 12:05.150
Yeah, would you like some popcorn?
Um. Won't take me a jiffy to make.

12:05.350 --> 12:06.764
What are you doing?

12:07.077 --> 12:08.288
I'm ingratiating myself.

12:08.365 --> 12:10.881
Stop it. It's nauseating.
It's called charm.

12:10.991 --> 12:13.538
I'm against it. I'm against charm.

12:13.617 --> 12:14.819
Yeah, we all know that.

12:14.905 --> 12:17.881
- I said don't move!
- I'm rooted.

12:17.992 --> 12:22.022
Shh! Did anybody hear that?

12:22.936 --> 12:24.663
Do you know what that sound was?

12:24.758 --> 12:26.038
What?

12:27.157 --> 12:29.709
That was the sound
of my patience

12:29.757 --> 12:31.709
shattering into a billion
little pieces.

12:31.790 --> 12:33.818
Now, there are only two things
that I need to know.

12:33.866 --> 12:38.123
Where is my friend and
what destroyed the Roman army?

12:38.310 --> 12:40.397
I destroyed the Roman army.

12:41.736 --> 12:42.974
Really?

12:43.087 --> 12:46.569
What? You, just on your own?
That's quite a trick.

12:46.662 --> 12:47.857
I am the gatekeeper.

12:47.945 --> 12:49.186
Gatekeeper. What gate?

12:49.273 --> 12:51.273
Didn't you hear the call?
Where were you?

12:51.349 --> 12:53.021
I had to find the gatekeeper's
things.

12:53.069 --> 12:54.100
Sorry, wait a minute.

12:54.148 --> 12:56.498
Are you the mighty warrior
that we've all been waiting for?

12:56.546 --> 12:58.342
Where are all the grown-ups?

12:59.545 --> 13:03.280
There was a great battle, a great
battle, and we beat the Romans.

13:03.351 --> 13:05.545
Kar beat them.
That's all that matters.

13:05.604 --> 13:07.716
Yes, but she's not a warrior.
She's an embryo.

13:07.780 --> 13:09.412
What did you do?
Throw your action figures at them?

13:09.459 --> 13:10.533
Listen, Roman...

13:10.596 --> 13:13.069
We're not Roman.
We're not part of the Roman army.

13:13.190 --> 13:16.639
No, we're not even slightly Italian.
I mean, I do a mean spag bol.

13:16.750 --> 13:19.170
Let me tell you about the Romans.

13:19.686 --> 13:21.873
They are the robbers of this world.

13:22.193 --> 13:26.654
When they've thieved everything on
land, they'll rob the sea.

13:27.021 --> 13:30.701
If their enemies are rich,
they'll take all they have.

13:31.553 --> 13:35.396
If their enemies are poor,
they'll make slaves of them.

13:35.834 --> 13:41.561
Their work is robbery,
slaughter, plunder.

13:42.100 --> 13:45.092
They do this work
and they call it empire.

13:46.093 --> 13:48.326
They make deserts
and they call it peace.

13:48.443 --> 13:50.615
Yeah, but you've got to love
the indoor toilets, yeah?

13:50.675 --> 13:52.635
They're not conquerors,
they're cowards.

13:52.689 --> 13:54.334
They're also all dead.

13:54.756 --> 13:57.076
There's an awful lot of dead cowards
out there,

13:57.973 --> 14:00.146
and I don't believe
that you killed them.

14:00.409 --> 14:02.287
Because the thing is,
you said gate,

14:02.436 --> 14:04.429
and you called yourself gatekeeper,
and you mentioned gate weapons,

14:04.476 --> 14:05.484
so I've got to wonder,

14:05.532 --> 14:07.842
what kind of a gate is that,
and what's on the other side?

14:07.919 --> 14:09.202
And yes, you're absolutely right.

14:09.249 --> 14:11.146
- Right?
- I am extremely quick.

14:11.351 --> 14:14.303
Listen, you are
all very, very angry,

14:14.459 --> 14:16.561
but really you're just very scared.

14:16.910 --> 14:20.225
For now, would you mind awfully
all just jumping out of your skins

14:20.273 --> 14:22.529
and allowing Nardole and I to escape
in the confusion?

14:22.670 --> 14:24.654
- Who are you?
- Let me explain.

14:37.473 --> 14:39.576
Monster!

14:41.963 --> 14:43.260
We're looking for Bill, right?

14:43.337 --> 14:45.817
No, we're looking for the maximum
danger in the immediate area

14:45.895 --> 14:47.635
and walking right into it.

14:47.776 --> 14:49.182
Yeah, but what about Bill?

14:49.277 --> 14:53.838
If she's there, we're saving her,
if she's not, she's safe already.

14:54.042 --> 14:57.065
Trust me,
this is not my first rodeo.

14:57.510 --> 15:00.815
Now, they think these cairns
are gateways between worlds.

15:01.999 --> 15:05.368
And given that they keep going on
about gates,

15:06.854 --> 15:08.534
possibly they're right.

15:13.893 --> 15:15.455
Oh! Oh!

15:18.470 --> 15:21.995
The gate's opening.
Your friend won't be coming back.

16:07.176 --> 16:09.888
The way I heard it,
the human ship was called

16:09.935 --> 16:11.787
the Mary Celeste.

16:11.910 --> 16:13.568
Something like that. Anyway,

16:13.621 --> 16:17.380
the Enzomodons assumed that any
species they encountered would

16:17.439 --> 16:20.599
communicate as they did,
by digesting each other.

16:20.702 --> 16:24.701
The Enzomodan ambassador got through
the whole crew

16:24.783 --> 16:28.623
and then very sadly choked
on a lifeboat So...

16:28.709 --> 16:29.990
You're back!

16:30.200 --> 16:32.275
They said you would probably
never come back.

16:32.361 --> 16:33.970
I was in there for seconds.

16:34.206 --> 16:35.406
Two days.

16:46.467 --> 16:49.087
It's an inter-dimensional
temporal rift.

16:49.750 --> 16:53.884
A second in there... equates to days
of time on this side.

16:54.016 --> 16:55.322
I was in there for two days?

16:55.386 --> 16:57.579
And eight hours,
five minutes, and...

16:57.670 --> 16:59.704
- Well, that's good, then, isn't it?
- Good?

16:59.837 --> 17:01.939
Plenty of time for you to find Bill.

17:02.392 --> 17:03.533
Oh.

17:03.616 --> 17:05.856
I looked. They helped me look.

17:05.990 --> 17:07.540
How hard did you look?

17:07.801 --> 17:09.251
I think we've lost her, Doctor.

17:09.321 --> 17:12.345
No. No, no, no.
We just don't know where she is.

17:12.451 --> 17:14.720
Not the same thing at all. Come on!

17:15.369 --> 17:17.823
I'll tell you about
the Lusitania later.

17:17.968 --> 17:19.760
Oh, keep an eye out for Bill.

17:20.848 --> 17:22.268
You have to move again.

17:22.415 --> 17:25.135
Stay in the sunlight,
it burns off the slime.

17:29.346 --> 17:31.550
- Thanks.
- No problem.

17:33.122 --> 17:36.362
Are you hungry?
Come on. You have to eat.

17:36.432 --> 17:38.471
- How much food have we got left?
- Enough.

17:38.683 --> 17:42.737
Really? Shut up, Cornelius.
Go on, eat it.

17:43.861 --> 17:45.885
It's two days, you haven't
had anything.

17:46.160 --> 17:48.768
I've never been lost this long,
I need to find him.

17:48.831 --> 17:51.182
- Who?
- The Doctor, my friend.

17:51.335 --> 17:53.971
I don't know what I'm going to do
if I can't find him.

17:54.167 --> 17:56.292
Well, we'll look after you.

17:58.067 --> 18:00.432
I'll have to find my way home
somehow.

18:01.293 --> 18:03.581
This is the safest place to be.

18:04.692 --> 18:06.412
The beast is still out there.

18:13.095 --> 18:16.041
You came back.
Did you know what was in there?

18:16.291 --> 18:17.415
The gate.

18:17.503 --> 18:21.056
A portal between dimensions, do you
know what's on the other side?

18:24.080 --> 18:25.783
You don't know anything, do you?

18:25.986 --> 18:28.197
You just stand around
making speeches

18:28.306 --> 18:30.377
and waving a TV aerial about.

18:31.510 --> 18:32.924
Shall I tell you what's in there?

18:32.983 --> 18:36.736
No. It's called the Eater Of Light,
and we held it back.

18:36.868 --> 18:39.525
Every generation, a new warrior went
into the gate and fought

18:39.573 --> 18:41.434
the Eater Of Light
so it couldn't break through.

18:41.481 --> 18:43.841
But the creature did break through.

18:44.377 --> 18:47.564
It broke through and it destroyed
the whole Ninth Legion.

18:47.907 --> 18:50.431
It's weak, it's nearly dead.
It will die soon.

18:50.524 --> 18:53.876
Well, let's hope so, because there
are millions more just like it,

18:53.992 --> 18:56.642
on the other side, and very soon all
of them will find their way

18:56.690 --> 18:58.810
through to this dimension.

18:59.174 --> 19:02.369
- Then I'll hold them back.
- You'll hold them back?

19:02.702 --> 19:05.041
What, with your lollypop and your
kiddy face paint

19:05.248 --> 19:07.262
and your crazy novelty
monster killing tool?

19:07.310 --> 19:08.878
Are you holding that thing
the right way up, by the way?

19:08.925 --> 19:10.415
I don't want your help!

19:10.556 --> 19:13.543
But I'm all you've got.
Believe me, I'm on your side.

19:13.990 --> 19:16.566
Come on, let's go!

19:18.185 --> 19:21.566
We're all in this together.
You're going to be fine.

19:22.039 --> 19:24.769
Marcus was hurt, like you, and
the sunlight healed him in the end.

19:25.473 --> 19:27.129
- I am feeling better.
- Good.

19:27.299 --> 19:29.859
Yeah, don't worry, Bill.
Lucius'll look after you.

19:29.907 --> 19:31.801
Shut up, Cornelius!

19:34.070 --> 19:37.105
Oh, Lucius. Erm...

19:37.310 --> 19:41.621
Right, listen, there's
something I should explain.

19:41.669 --> 19:42.749
What?

19:42.797 --> 19:46.184
This is probably just
a really difficult idea.

19:46.895 --> 19:50.270
I don't like men... that way.

19:51.215 --> 19:52.566
What? Not ever?

19:52.679 --> 19:55.238
No. Not ever.

19:56.566 --> 19:57.647
Only women.

19:57.750 --> 20:00.230
Oh! All right. Yeah, I got it.

20:00.447 --> 20:02.007
You're like Vitus, then.

20:02.332 --> 20:04.043
What? He only likes men.

20:04.202 --> 20:08.184
Some men.
Better looking men than you, Lucius.

20:08.351 --> 20:11.471
I don't think it's narrow-minded,
I think it's fine.

20:11.550 --> 20:12.871
You know what you like.

20:13.081 --> 20:15.199
And you like both?

20:15.367 --> 20:18.007
I'm just ordinary.
You know, like men and women.

20:18.223 --> 20:21.949
Huh! Well, isn't this
all very... modern.

20:22.113 --> 20:23.910
Hey, not everyone has to be modern.

20:24.191 --> 20:27.676
I think it's really sweet
that you're so... restricted.

20:28.879 --> 20:30.645
Cheers.
We can be friends, though.

20:30.762 --> 20:32.872
I did save your life,
that means we're friends forever.

20:32.919 --> 20:35.605
Yeah. I can deal with that.

20:39.088 --> 20:41.151
Why's it going dark?
The sun's setting.

20:41.252 --> 20:42.852
No, it's the beast.

20:42.962 --> 20:45.675
It's circling us,
it's looking for a way in.

20:51.547 --> 20:55.081
It's getting stronger again.
It's strong enough to feed.

20:55.721 --> 20:59.925
Every hour of sunlight that
feeds it makes the world darker

21:00.526 --> 21:02.292
and the beast stronger.

21:04.241 --> 21:05.561
We've got very little time.

21:05.710 --> 21:09.358
I have to stop it. This is my fault.

21:09.628 --> 21:11.710
I'm the keeper of the gate.
I have to put this right.

21:11.758 --> 21:13.234
So you were supposed to guard
the gate

21:13.281 --> 21:14.603
while everyone else
went off to war.

21:14.650 --> 21:17.140
But you had strangers at the door,
and a guard dog in the attic.

21:17.187 --> 21:19.022
So you let the beast come through.

21:19.091 --> 21:20.936
It was the only thing that
could defeat them.

21:20.984 --> 21:24.155
So you thought the Eater Of Light
could destroy a whole Roman army?

21:24.210 --> 21:25.264
It did.

21:25.314 --> 21:29.147
And a whole Roman army could
weaken or kill the beast?

21:29.390 --> 21:30.429
Yes.

21:30.506 --> 21:31.546
Well, it didn't work.

21:31.594 --> 21:34.202
You got a Roman legion slaughtered
and you made the deadliest

21:34.267 --> 21:36.593
creature on this planet
very, very cross indeed.

21:36.922 --> 21:40.962
To protect a muddy little hillside,
you doomed your whole world.

21:43.647 --> 21:46.412
One man.
You think one man can save us all?

21:46.460 --> 21:49.975
Come and meet him.
He came here to meet you.

21:50.434 --> 21:53.936
He's met loads of people like you -
the terrified, the desperate.

21:54.194 --> 21:56.819
And he always helps.
He always makes a difference.

21:56.903 --> 22:01.103
There are painted barbarians up
there. They outnumber us.

22:01.276 --> 22:03.006
There is a beast of darkness

22:03.054 --> 22:05.662
that laid waste to an entire legion
in less than an hour.

22:05.710 --> 22:07.639
No one man can make
a difference to that.

22:07.699 --> 22:10.077
Maybe that's what you don't learn
when you think it takes

22:10.125 --> 22:12.053
5,000 highly trained soldiers

22:12.101 --> 22:14.350
to slaughter a bunch of
Scottish farmers.

22:14.630 --> 22:18.202
Yes, one man can. And he's here.

22:18.590 --> 22:20.910
If you're calling us cowards,
carry on.

22:21.161 --> 22:23.053
We already ran away - we know.

22:23.234 --> 22:26.928
You're not cowards. You're scared.

22:28.295 --> 22:31.217
Scared is fine, scared is human.

22:31.647 --> 22:34.936
But I'll tell you what it isn't.
It isn't a plan.

22:37.505 --> 22:38.810
- She's right.
- Why are you

22:38.858 --> 22:39.983
even listening to her, Grandad?

22:40.030 --> 22:42.350
Because no-one else is saying
anything.

22:44.866 --> 22:46.217
We need a plan.

22:46.435 --> 22:48.280
A real commander would have a plan.

22:55.830 --> 22:57.548
Why did he call you Grandad?

22:58.356 --> 23:00.439
They always call me Grandad.

23:00.999 --> 23:02.509
I'm the command,

23:02.924 --> 23:04.830
I'm the oldest one left.

23:05.790 --> 23:07.070
How old are you?

23:08.442 --> 23:09.522
18.

23:12.930 --> 23:15.337
Right, listen to me. All of you.

23:16.908 --> 23:18.533
I'm going up there to find
my friend.

23:18.786 --> 23:23.572
If you come with me, I can't promise
that you won't all die.

23:24.641 --> 23:26.439
But I can promise you this.

23:26.836 --> 23:29.384
You won't all die
in a hole in the ground.

23:35.630 --> 23:38.556
We have to drive it back through
and close the portal behind it.

23:39.257 --> 23:42.876
Now, the gate only opens when
the dawn sun hits it. Why's that?

23:45.390 --> 23:48.205
Our ancestors couldn't close
the gate completely,

23:48.390 --> 23:50.642
but they built the cairn
to control it.

23:51.192 --> 23:54.783
Like venting an oil gush.
If they let the portal open a few

23:54.831 --> 23:57.681
moments every year, they stop
the whole thing ripping apart.

23:57.994 --> 23:59.658
It's quite clever, really.

24:00.510 --> 24:01.853
Are you sulking?

24:02.433 --> 24:03.993
I'm remembering the dead.

24:04.102 --> 24:07.009
Oh, right. Well, save that
for old age.

24:07.224 --> 24:08.415
They're dead because of me.

24:08.468 --> 24:10.837
You know, every moment you waste
wallowing about in that

24:10.885 --> 24:13.634
happy thought means more of the
living are going to join them.

24:14.188 --> 24:18.165
When you want to win a war,
remember this - it's not about you.

24:18.870 --> 24:20.283
Believe me. I know.

24:20.779 --> 24:23.244
Time to grow up, Kar.

24:24.550 --> 24:26.251
Time to fight your fight.

24:27.910 --> 24:29.439
How does this work?

24:29.982 --> 24:32.330
It poisons the light
as the beast eats it.

24:32.501 --> 24:36.040
Good. We'll need more of this.

24:36.252 --> 24:39.111
It has optical cancellation
properties.

24:39.830 --> 24:42.283
Now, we have one chance.

24:42.558 --> 24:45.087
Right now it's weak,
it's injured, it's starving.

24:45.162 --> 24:48.189
But when the sun comes up,
it will feed and grow strong.

24:48.237 --> 24:49.908
We have to lure it back through
the portal

24:49.978 --> 24:51.783
before that happens,
before sunrise.

24:51.831 --> 24:53.587
Now, I've got a plan.

24:54.611 --> 24:55.986
But I need your help.

24:56.630 --> 24:57.962
I am afraid.

24:58.142 --> 24:59.431
Who isn't?

25:00.126 --> 25:02.900
But you've still got to face
your beast anyway.

25:05.630 --> 25:06.790
Can you do that?

25:09.056 --> 25:10.256
Aye.

25:28.569 --> 25:29.810
Shhh!

25:31.172 --> 25:32.786
It's nothing!

25:33.205 --> 25:35.341
It's the wind in the rocks.

25:35.809 --> 25:38.763
Forward, centurion, keep going.

25:39.755 --> 25:42.724
There are lots of entrances
the beast could get through.

25:42.970 --> 25:44.490
It's a labyrinth

25:53.431 --> 25:56.991
This is where we hear them.
The barbarians.

25:57.475 --> 25:59.540
Right up there, up above us.

25:59.622 --> 26:01.579
Are you sure your friend
will be with them?

26:01.664 --> 26:05.360
Yeah. Basically, he always ends up
being boss of the locals.

26:05.555 --> 26:08.634
- How?
- Usually by annoying them.

26:11.649 --> 26:13.243
What was that?

26:14.157 --> 26:16.626
All right, centurions, stay sharp.

26:16.779 --> 26:18.415
That's the way out.
So let's get out.

26:18.474 --> 26:21.353
Easy, Cornelius, let's make sure we
know what we're walking into.

26:21.446 --> 26:23.595
No. Let's go.

26:23.930 --> 26:25.649
Don't hurry up. No! Wait!

26:26.650 --> 26:28.087
GROWLING

26:28.478 --> 26:30.290
HE SCREAMS

26:36.337 --> 26:37.821
SCREAMING

26:37.925 --> 26:41.079
Quick! Douse the fire! Quickly!

26:44.587 --> 26:46.550
Shift your arse, Roman!

26:54.664 --> 26:56.024
Close the trap door.

26:58.399 --> 27:00.329
Block it off!
We have to block it off!

27:00.721 --> 27:03.201
Centurions, defence formation.

27:04.102 --> 27:06.446
It's falling back.
It's waiting.

27:06.563 --> 27:08.329
It's waiting to feed off
the sunlight,

27:08.377 --> 27:09.954
to grow to its full strength.

27:10.032 --> 27:12.110
- Hello.
- Hi.

27:13.230 --> 27:14.735
I brought you the Ninth Legion.

27:14.783 --> 27:18.532
- Whoa, there they are.
- The lost Legion of the Ninth.

27:18.768 --> 27:21.720
- Totally found them.
- Yeah, you totally did.

27:23.298 --> 27:27.290
Nardole, what happened to you?

27:27.555 --> 27:29.462
- Oh, I'm blending in.
- Um.

27:29.626 --> 27:31.735
Welcome to our land.

27:31.783 --> 27:33.102
HE CHUCKLES
Scotch.

27:33.166 --> 27:34.524
Drop your weapons.

27:34.583 --> 27:36.280
Oh, for goodness' sake!
We don't have time for this!

27:36.327 --> 27:37.923
- Stay back!
- Lucius! Stop it!

27:37.971 --> 27:39.371
Are you their champion now?

27:39.419 --> 27:42.859
- There is no time for fighting!
- Exactly.

27:42.938 --> 27:45.087
We never wanted to fight.

27:45.470 --> 27:49.516
We lived in peace, and then you
came and laid waste to

27:49.564 --> 27:51.430
everything and everyone we loved.

27:51.669 --> 27:53.665
All you understand is war.

27:53.907 --> 27:55.438
No. He understands.

27:56.319 --> 27:59.766
Don't you?
And now he's wondering why.

28:00.944 --> 28:03.782
- You speak Latin?
- I don't!

28:05.063 --> 28:07.360
Neither do I. Not a word.

28:08.136 --> 28:11.110
And I don't speak whatever
they speak either.

28:11.329 --> 28:12.696
It's him.

28:13.626 --> 28:15.884
- It's you, isn't it?
- Yes. It's me.

28:16.149 --> 28:18.782
Something to do with the TARDIS,
maybe? Telepathic field?

28:19.051 --> 28:22.321
So now that we all understand
each other, how do we all sound?

28:22.970 --> 28:25.954
You sound like children.
You sound like children, too.

28:26.085 --> 28:28.266
You all do.
Is this what happens?

28:28.467 --> 28:31.384
When you understand what everyone
in the universe is saying,

28:31.831 --> 28:33.468
everybody just sounds like
children.

28:33.691 --> 28:35.251
There are exceptions.

28:35.797 --> 28:37.274
Thank you very much. Not you.

28:37.942 --> 28:42.102
OK, kids, pay attention.

28:42.234 --> 28:43.415
She slaughtered your legion.

28:43.480 --> 28:45.923
You slaughtered everything
that she loves.

28:45.999 --> 28:47.688
Now you all have a choice.

28:47.902 --> 28:50.822
You can carry on slaughtering
each other

28:51.055 --> 28:54.735
till no-one is left standing,
or you grow the hell up!

28:55.149 --> 28:57.030
Because there's a new war now.

28:57.399 --> 29:03.938
I think these creatures
are light-eating locusts.

29:04.753 --> 29:07.713
Looking for rents and cracks
between worlds

29:07.800 --> 29:10.626
to let themselves into
dimensions of light.

29:11.630 --> 29:15.196
Once they break through, they eat.

29:16.743 --> 29:18.485
They will eat the sun,

29:19.500 --> 29:23.391
and then they will eat the stars.

29:24.618 --> 29:26.618
And they will keep eating

29:26.858 --> 29:31.970
until... there are no stars left.

29:34.662 --> 29:35.993
So, whose side are you on now?

29:36.041 --> 29:38.881
Because as far as I can see,
there's only one side left.

29:43.230 --> 29:44.954
If it helps,

29:46.321 --> 29:47.990
I do have a plan.

29:57.382 --> 30:00.672
It feeds on light
but it homes in on sound.

30:00.937 --> 30:02.812
- So what's going to happen?
- It's simple.

30:02.901 --> 30:06.383
Bit of noise,
lure the beast here,

30:06.734 --> 30:08.351
Drive it back through the gate.

30:08.568 --> 30:11.750
But how do we keep it there?
I mean, you said,

30:11.805 --> 30:13.087
all those things are going to
come through, right?

30:13.134 --> 30:14.556
They can only come through
one at a time.

30:14.603 --> 30:15.484
I know.

30:15.532 --> 30:17.212
That's why guarding the gate worked.

30:17.382 --> 30:19.702
One Pict in there,
fighting it off for a few minutes,

30:19.750 --> 30:22.276
that adds up to 60 or 70
years out here,.

30:22.423 --> 30:25.145
I get it, yeah, and then the next
one goes in.

30:25.599 --> 30:27.190
But what do we going to do
this time?

30:27.349 --> 30:28.599
Or are you going line up Picts

30:28.653 --> 30:30.981
sacrificing themselves until
the end of the world?

30:32.214 --> 30:34.044
I've got a better idea this time.

30:34.362 --> 30:36.520
Which is the part you never tell me.

30:36.568 --> 30:37.949
