WEBVTT

00:32.699 --> 00:36.157
(whistling to the tune
of "The Farmer in the Dell")

00:41.624 --> 00:44.752
(walker growling)

00:44.919 --> 00:48.377
(whistling continues)

01:24.751 --> 01:26.287
(whistling stops)

01:29.547 --> 01:32.914
(grunts)

02:04.624 --> 02:08.208
(whistling resumes)

02:18.972 --> 02:22.430
(Aaron breathing heavily)

02:27.897 --> 02:29.728
What time is it?

02:32.402 --> 02:34.734
Just past 5:30.

02:36.573 --> 02:38.404
Let's go.

03:00.889 --> 03:04.097
Didn't see that
last night.

03:04.267 --> 03:05.882
Didn't see what?

03:11.441 --> 03:14.774
George:
Still going.

03:14.944 --> 03:17.856
Looks like
the end of them, though.

03:18.031 --> 03:19.487
All damn night.

03:21.159 --> 03:22.399
At least
Negan's smart enough

03:22.577 --> 03:24.784
not to let that mess
anywhere near us.

03:24.954 --> 03:27.787
Fat Joey's good
for something, at least.

03:27.957 --> 03:29.458
What, eating cake?

03:30.627 --> 03:32.709
He rigged the herdway.

03:32.879 --> 03:34.164
Just trips.

03:34.339 --> 03:35.624
Nothing fancy.

03:35.798 --> 03:37.959
Guerilla kind of stuff.

03:38.134 --> 03:40.796
What kind of stuff?

03:40.970 --> 03:43.461
As in warfare, idiot.

03:43.640 --> 03:46.256
Those demo sticks
from that run last month,

03:46.434 --> 03:48.846
the RPGs
from the new guys.

03:49.020 --> 03:51.887
(sighs)
Maybe it takes it down.

03:52.065 --> 03:55.148
Takes them out.

03:55.318 --> 03:57.855
All right,
it's a trickle.

03:58.029 --> 04:00.145
- Let's go.
- Finally.

04:00.323 --> 04:01.984
Thank Christ.

04:09.499 --> 04:11.660
(engine starts)

05:04.178 --> 05:06.760
Making a trail.

05:06.931 --> 05:09.798
I think we're close.

05:16.482 --> 05:19.394
We should bailout,
follow the rest of the way,

05:19.569 --> 05:20.604
see what we can see.

05:20.778 --> 05:23.440
I, uh-- how?

05:23.614 --> 05:26.481
It isn't usually the fall
that gets us.

05:26.659 --> 05:28.775
It's trying to fight it.
Run with it or roll with it.

05:28.953 --> 05:31.569
The truck's
going slow enough.

05:31.748 --> 05:32.828
We'll be
in the blind spot.

05:32.999 --> 05:34.284
We can race behind
one of the other cars.

05:34.459 --> 05:35.574
l-if-- if I screw up
and we get caught--

05:35.752 --> 05:39.540
It'll be fine.
We just got to go now.

05:39.714 --> 05:41.454
Okay.
Show me first.

05:57.940 --> 06:01.774
(chuckles)
"Show me first."

06:03.112 --> 06:08.982
(walkers growling)

06:21.756 --> 06:23.496
(brakes squeal)

06:25.259 --> 06:27.966
Negan: Okay, boys, let's get
this haul unloaded and inside.

06:28.137 --> 06:30.970
I want to get back in there
and unload a little myself.

06:31.140 --> 06:33.631
Man: Negan, need to talk to you
about redirect.

06:33.810 --> 06:35.596
What about the redirect?

06:35.770 --> 06:36.759
It got screwed up.

06:36.938 --> 06:38.474
We're on it now,
but it's a mess out there.

06:38.648 --> 06:40.479
And whose job was that?

06:40.650 --> 06:42.390
George:
...a pack and a tent...

06:42.568 --> 06:43.603
Aw, damn.

06:43.778 --> 06:45.018
I thought
they packed this up tight.

06:45.196 --> 06:46.481
Ah, no worries.

06:46.656 --> 06:47.987
Plenty more
where this came from.

06:48.157 --> 06:50.990
Right?
(laughter)

06:52.995 --> 06:55.327
Son of a bitch!

06:55.498 --> 06:58.831
(laughs)
What the hell?

07:01.003 --> 07:03.210
Stay back!
Drop your weapons.

07:06.008 --> 07:07.748
I only want Negan.

07:07.927 --> 07:09.838
He killed my friends.

07:10.012 --> 07:12.549
No one else needs to die.

07:13.516 --> 07:16.428
(Negan whistling)

07:19.188 --> 07:21.600
Damn.

07:24.068 --> 07:28.858
You are adorable.

07:29.031 --> 07:32.273
Did you pick that gun
'cause it looks cool?

07:32.452 --> 07:34.864
You totally did,
right?

07:35.037 --> 07:37.824
Kid,
I ain't gonna lie,

07:37.999 --> 07:41.116
you scare the shit
outta me.

07:44.672 --> 07:46.537
(grunts)

07:46.716 --> 07:47.956
Kid!

07:48.134 --> 07:49.999
Negan: Dwight.

07:50.178 --> 07:52.715
Back off.

07:59.896 --> 08:03.730
Is that any way
to treat our new guest?

08:06.903 --> 08:08.268
Come on, kid.

08:08.446 --> 08:09.731
I will show you around.

08:09.906 --> 08:13.148
(walkers growling)

08:50.780 --> 08:54.944
(music playing)

09:31.153 --> 09:32.984
(walkers growling)

09:34.073 --> 09:35.279
Come on, kid.

09:35.449 --> 09:37.735
I'll show you around.

09:37.910 --> 09:41.448
You know, you do the same
damn stink-eye as your dad,

09:41.622 --> 09:44.113
except it's only
half as good 'cause...

09:44.292 --> 09:45.907
well, you know, you're...

09:46.085 --> 09:47.416
missing an eye.

09:47.587 --> 09:49.999
(chuckles)

09:51.048 --> 09:52.834
Really?

09:53.009 --> 09:55.421
You're really not
gonna take my hand?

09:55.595 --> 09:59.087
'Cause you're lucky
you even still have a hand.

10:00.224 --> 10:02.636
Same as your boy Daryl
over here,

10:02.810 --> 10:04.675
now that
I think about it.

10:04.854 --> 10:07.436
How's the job going,
Daryl?

10:07.607 --> 10:09.188
Hot enough for you?

10:09.358 --> 10:11.974
Yeah, it'd be tough
with one arm.

10:12.153 --> 10:14.735
(chuckles)

10:20.786 --> 10:22.037
Ah, smart kid.

10:22.204 --> 10:25.287
Now come with me.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.790
Dwighty-boy,
why don't you grab Daryl,

10:27.960 --> 10:30.747
take him to the kitchen,
do a little grub prep.

10:30.921 --> 10:32.081
New plan, boys.

10:32.256 --> 10:34.713
Let's burn the dead,
unload the truck later.

10:34.884 --> 10:36.795
Damn, I am not
gonna have time

10:36.969 --> 10:39.631
to screw
any of my wives today.

10:41.307 --> 10:43.172
I mean, maybe one.

10:43.351 --> 10:45.262
(walkers growling)

10:48.105 --> 10:49.481
Come on.

10:49.649 --> 10:51.230
What are you
gonna do to me?

10:51.400 --> 10:52.981
(door opens)

10:55.821 --> 10:57.652
(door closes)

10:59.325 --> 11:00.986
Number one,

11:01.160 --> 11:03.993
do not shatter
my image of you.

11:04.163 --> 11:05.528
You're a badass.

11:05.706 --> 11:06.741
You're not scared of shit.

11:06.916 --> 11:09.328
Don't be scared of me.
It's a disappointment.

11:09.502 --> 11:10.742
Number two...

11:11.879 --> 11:14.040
you really want me
to ruin the surprise?

11:16.133 --> 11:18.670
Screw you, kid.

11:18.844 --> 11:20.675
Seriously.

11:20.846 --> 11:26.182
Screw you.

11:27.770 --> 11:31.012
(indistinct conversations)

11:35.611 --> 11:38.023
Check this out.

11:50.960 --> 11:52.951
The Saviors
have gone out into the world

11:53.129 --> 11:54.414
and fought the dead

11:54.588 --> 11:58.001
and come back
with some really good stuff.

11:58.175 --> 12:01.793
Some of that stuff
can be yours

12:01.971 --> 12:07.466
if you work hard
and play by the rules.

12:07.643 --> 12:13.263
Today, everybody gets
fresh vegetables at dinner.

12:13.441 --> 12:15.648
No points needed.

12:15.818 --> 12:19.060
(applause)

12:20.156 --> 12:22.647
You see that?

12:22.825 --> 12:25.658
Respect.

12:25.828 --> 12:28.240
Cool, huh?

12:28.414 --> 12:30.325
They still
on their knees?

12:31.333 --> 12:32.948
As you were!

12:39.383 --> 12:41.248
Hey, I wanted to show you
a few potentials

12:41.427 --> 12:42.837
I've rated B-plus
or higher.

12:43.012 --> 12:44.172
I know
where we're going.

12:44.346 --> 12:46.507
While I'm picking up
a high level of certainty,

12:46.682 --> 12:48.092
I'd be remiss
if! didn't mention

12:48.267 --> 12:50.178
that after a thorough analysis
of the grid,

12:50.352 --> 12:52.183
X'ing out any places
we've already combed,

12:52.354 --> 12:53.935
I do believe
I've bull's-eyed

12:54.106 --> 12:56.188
some worth considering
for the specific task at hand.

12:56.358 --> 12:57.859
What?

12:58.027 --> 13:00.769
Finding goods for Negan.

13:06.202 --> 13:08.989
You're not going out to find
stuff for the Saviors?

13:09.163 --> 13:10.573
(scoffs)

13:10.748 --> 13:12.113
Why not?

13:13.667 --> 13:15.578
There's no fighting it,
Rosita.

13:16.921 --> 13:18.877
Perhaps we should all
travel together.

13:19.048 --> 13:20.333
I'm down.

13:20.508 --> 13:21.998
We come across
a haystack,

13:22.176 --> 13:23.882
four POVs could draw out
whatever we're looking for.

13:24.053 --> 13:25.589
We're fine on our own.

13:25.763 --> 13:26.843
I know
you don't like it

13:27.014 --> 13:28.720
and you don't
want to hear it from me,

13:28.891 --> 13:31.223
but we got to produce
for them.

13:31.393 --> 13:32.894
This is like taxes.

13:33.062 --> 13:34.802
- Hey.
- Come here.

13:34.980 --> 13:36.356
Hey.

13:37.775 --> 13:38.855
You can keep acting pissed at me,

13:39.026 --> 13:40.232
but I didn't do this.

13:40.402 --> 13:41.938
Rick did.

13:43.239 --> 13:45.275
You think
you can do better.

13:45.449 --> 13:47.440
Yes.

13:47.618 --> 13:50.655
(chuckles)
Sure.

13:50.830 --> 13:53.697
No, I bet you already have
a whole truck-load full of stuff

13:53.874 --> 13:55.455
hidden out there
for yourself, huh?

13:56.919 --> 13:58.079
Go get it.

13:58.254 --> 14:02.247
Pay your taxes,
and leave me the hell alone.

14:04.760 --> 14:06.125
Let's go.

14:21.026 --> 14:23.108
Ladies.

14:23.279 --> 14:26.521
Don't mind the kid.

14:29.201 --> 14:31.157
I know.

14:31.328 --> 14:32.738
Every woman
where you're from

14:32.913 --> 14:35.404
dresses like they do the books
at an auto shop.

14:35.583 --> 14:38.666
You're gonna want to look
at their titties.

14:38.836 --> 14:40.622
It's cool.
I won't mind.

14:40.796 --> 14:44.960
They won't mind.
Knock yourself out.

14:49.638 --> 14:53.756
Can I talk to you
for a minute, dear wife?

14:58.981 --> 15:01.142
Make yourself comfortable, kid.

15:10.576 --> 15:13.318
(sighs)

15:21.837 --> 15:23.998
What happened
with Amber and Mark?

15:24.173 --> 15:26.038
What we talk about
when you're not here

15:26.216 --> 15:28.252
is none
of your business.

15:30.512 --> 15:32.377
Fair play.

15:38.520 --> 15:40.511
You want to know
what I heard?

15:42.733 --> 15:45.440
I heard that Mark
skipped out on redirect duty

15:45.611 --> 15:47.021
to be with Amber.

15:48.739 --> 15:51.606
I need to know
if it's true.

15:55.537 --> 15:57.368
Ahh.

15:57.539 --> 16:00.872
There are rules
for a reason.

16:01.043 --> 16:03.204
Nothing matters
if you're dead.

16:03.379 --> 16:09.045
You, my dear,
are here because you get that.

16:15.140 --> 16:17.301
She made a mistake.

16:17.476 --> 16:19.341
Go easy on her.

16:19.520 --> 16:22.102
Calm the hell down.

16:27.236 --> 16:29.727
lever hit one of you?

16:30.906 --> 16:32.146
No.

16:33.242 --> 16:34.448
But I know you.

16:34.618 --> 16:37.075
There's worse.

16:46.922 --> 16:50.210
Well, look at you!

16:51.427 --> 16:54.260
(chuckles)

16:54.430 --> 16:56.170
To be continued.

17:00.102 --> 17:03.344
(music playing)

17:27.838 --> 17:30.420
Amber, baby.

17:32.134 --> 17:33.465
You know
I don't want anyone here

17:33.635 --> 17:36.968
that doesn't want
to be here, right?

17:37.139 --> 17:38.675
Mm-hmm.

17:38.849 --> 17:40.134
Oh.

17:40.309 --> 17:43.972
So if you want to leave
and go back to Mark...

17:44.146 --> 17:45.602
you can.

17:46.815 --> 17:49.272
But what can't you do?

17:51.445 --> 17:52.434
Cheat on you.

17:52.613 --> 17:55.980
That is exactly right.

17:56.158 --> 17:58.274
You can't...

18:00.120 --> 18:02.611
cheat on me.

18:06.293 --> 18:07.408
There's plenty
of other gals

18:07.586 --> 18:09.122
who would love
to take your place,

18:09.296 --> 18:13.460
and there's a few job openings
that I can think of.

18:13.634 --> 18:17.126
You want to go back to Mark
and your mom?

18:17.304 --> 18:20.467
Hell, I'll put you all
on the same job.

18:20.641 --> 18:22.097
No.

18:23.644 --> 18:25.225
I'll stay.

18:25.395 --> 18:27.647
l'm-- I'm sorry.

18:29.233 --> 18:31.189
You know
what that means, right?

18:32.444 --> 18:36.403
You know
what that means, right?

18:37.866 --> 18:41.108
Ye-- yes.

18:42.663 --> 18:44.699
I love you, Negan.

18:44.873 --> 18:48.786
Oh, of course
you do, darlin'.

18:51.338 --> 18:54.501
I don't know
why you're crying.

18:54.675 --> 18:57.667
It's all gonna work out aces
for you.

19:02.349 --> 19:05.512
(chuckles)

19:23.203 --> 19:25.364
Will you get Carson
for me?

19:26.874 --> 19:29.115
- Yeah.
- Did you see that?

19:29.293 --> 19:30.703
Wasn't hard on her,

19:30.878 --> 19:35.463
even though I am...
very hard in general.

19:35.632 --> 19:37.247
You're an asshole.

19:37.426 --> 19:38.711
I know.

19:38.886 --> 19:43.220
But the messed-up thing is,
you like me anyway.

19:43.390 --> 19:46.882
You know the truth,
just like me.

20:14.463 --> 20:16.328
(chuckles)

20:27.935 --> 20:31.427
Carl, will you grab
this tray for me?

20:36.276 --> 20:37.732
Why do you
got him here?

20:37.903 --> 20:39.393
Whoa!

20:40.656 --> 20:44.365
What we talk about
when you're not here...

20:45.327 --> 20:47.818
is none
of your business.

20:52.584 --> 20:54.745
Do not make me
put this toothpick

20:54.920 --> 20:57.878
through the only eye
he has.

20:58.966 --> 21:00.672
You go with Dwight.

21:00.842 --> 21:02.673
He'll get you a mop.

21:02.844 --> 21:04.345
Dwighty boy...

21:04.513 --> 21:07.255
fire up that furnace.

21:07.432 --> 21:09.388
I'll be down
in a few.

21:09.559 --> 21:11.891
Time for
a little déja vu.

21:13.480 --> 21:16.813
Come on, kid.

21:49.558 --> 21:52.675
We have today and only today
to find somethin'.

21:53.729 --> 21:56.516
They could be back
by tomorrow.

21:56.690 --> 21:58.681
Could be back now.

22:24.593 --> 22:26.879
Hating somebody--
is that a sin?

22:28.722 --> 22:30.929
No.

22:31.099 --> 22:33.010
Well,
not necessarily.

22:33.185 --> 22:35.221
Thoughts are just thoughts.

22:36.229 --> 22:38.356
It's our actions
that matter in the end.

22:48.784 --> 22:50.695
I hate Rick.

22:52.204 --> 22:54.115
He was a cop.
Fine.

22:54.289 --> 22:56.450
He shouldn't be
in charge.

22:56.625 --> 22:59.742
My mother, she--

22:59.920 --> 23:01.706
she served in Congress.

23:01.880 --> 23:02.915
She led people.

23:03.090 --> 23:04.876
She brought out the good
in people.

23:05.050 --> 23:08.133
Rick brought out
the good in me.

23:08.303 --> 23:10.885
B How?
y bullying you?

23:11.890 --> 23:13.551
(chuckles)

23:13.725 --> 23:15.807
A little.

23:17.104 --> 23:19.186
But mostly
by inspiring me.

23:21.191 --> 23:23.056
He didn't just
keep people alive.

23:23.235 --> 23:25.567
He brought us
all together.

23:25.737 --> 23:28.604
He's not perfect, but he's a man
who finds his way.

23:28.782 --> 23:31.899
He didn't keep everybody alive,
Gabriel.

23:32.077 --> 23:34.159
My mother, my father,
my brother...

23:34.329 --> 23:35.614
It wasn't his fault.

23:35.789 --> 23:39.577
He got here, they died.

23:39.751 --> 23:42.663
Or maybe other people didn't die
because he got here.

23:42.838 --> 23:45.580
Or maybe we shouldn't have
attacked that outpost

23:45.757 --> 23:47.258
- and then Glenn--
- We don't know!

23:49.553 --> 23:51.589
We can't.

23:51.763 --> 23:54.095
We don't get to.

23:56.768 --> 23:58.053
We're here now...

23:58.228 --> 24:01.095
and we can look
to the future.

24:03.775 --> 24:04.890
What future?

24:05.068 --> 24:07.445
There's no future
with him in charge.

24:10.240 --> 24:13.607
The thing I can't stop thinking
is that...

24:13.785 --> 24:17.903
maybe the only good thing
that could happen for us now...

24:18.081 --> 24:20.117
is he never
makes it back.

24:24.588 --> 24:26.954
Stop the car.

24:31.553 --> 24:34.841
(brakes squeal)

24:41.480 --> 24:43.391
What you're saying--

24:43.565 --> 24:46.147
it doesn't make you
a sinner.

24:47.527 --> 24:50.815
But it does make you
a tremendous shit.

24:52.324 --> 24:54.155
But just for now.

24:55.827 --> 24:57.988
It doesn't
have to be terminal.

25:07.047 --> 25:09.129
I'm gonna go back.

25:19.559 --> 25:21.971
(car door closes)

26:03.019 --> 26:05.305
(walker growling in distance)

26:30.380 --> 26:32.086
(groans)

26:38.930 --> 26:41.262
Are all of those women
actually your--

26:41.433 --> 26:43.048
Wives? Yeah.

26:43.226 --> 26:46.059
Always wanted to screw a whole
bunch of different women.

26:46.229 --> 26:47.890
I mean, why settle
forjust one?

26:48.064 --> 26:50.771
Why follow
the same old rules?

26:50.942 --> 26:53.399
Why not
make life better?

26:53.570 --> 26:56.528
Speaking of...

26:56.698 --> 26:58.188
sit.

27:00.493 --> 27:02.404
Let's get started.

27:02.579 --> 27:04.365
Started on what?

27:04.539 --> 27:05.904
(chuckles)

27:06.082 --> 27:10.416
I want to get to know you
a little better, Carl.

27:10.587 --> 27:12.498
Why?

27:12.672 --> 27:14.253
Work it out.

27:14.424 --> 27:15.880
You're smart.

27:16.051 --> 27:18.884
In fact, I'm gonna tell you
just how smart you are,

27:19.054 --> 27:20.840
in case
you don't already know.

27:21.014 --> 27:24.927
See, I'd expect a kid your age
to be moping around,

27:25.101 --> 27:26.557
not doing a damn thing,

27:26.728 --> 27:29.265
except crying
about missing the prom.

27:29.439 --> 27:34.979
But you--
why you go on a mission.

27:35.153 --> 27:37.986
You find me,
you kill two of my men,

27:38.156 --> 27:39.487
and you're smart enough
to know

27:39.658 --> 27:43.492
that I'm not gonna
let this slide.

27:45.664 --> 27:47.074
(chuckles)

27:47.248 --> 27:52.038
Ah, I can't-- I can't do it.

27:52.212 --> 27:54.874
It's like talking
to a birthday present.

27:55.882 --> 27:57.418
You got to take that crap
off your face.

27:57.592 --> 27:59.628
I want to see
what Grandma got me.

27:59.803 --> 28:02.215
No.

28:02.389 --> 28:04.004
Two men!

28:06.017 --> 28:08.099
Two... men.

28:08.269 --> 28:10.681
Punishment.

28:13.024 --> 28:16.892
Do you really want
to piss me off?

28:24.703 --> 28:26.739
(sighs)

28:42.804 --> 28:44.886
(chuckles)

28:45.056 --> 28:47.263
Almost there.

28:47.434 --> 28:49.720
(chuckles)

28:54.232 --> 28:56.223
Get that hair
out of your face.

28:56.401 --> 28:58.062
Let me see.

29:02.574 --> 29:03.905
Christ!

29:04.075 --> 29:06.316
That is disgusting.

29:06.494 --> 29:08.405
No wonder
you cover that up.

29:08.580 --> 29:09.660
Have you seen it?

29:09.831 --> 29:11.822
I mean, have you
looked in the mirror?

29:12.000 --> 29:14.332
That is
gross as hell.

29:14.502 --> 29:17.539
I can see
your socket.

29:17.714 --> 29:20.922
(chuckles)
I want to touch it.

29:21.092 --> 29:22.502
Oh, come on.
Can I touch it?

29:30.518 --> 29:33.351
(sighs)

29:33.521 --> 29:36.058
Damn.

29:38.568 --> 29:41.025
Holy hell, kid.

29:42.280 --> 29:44.111
Look...

29:46.618 --> 29:47.698
Ijust--

29:47.869 --> 29:51.657
it's easy to forget
that you're...

29:51.831 --> 29:52.946
just a kid.

29:53.124 --> 29:54.660
(sniffles)

29:54.834 --> 29:56.620
And I didn't mean to hurt
your feelings or anything.

29:56.795 --> 29:59.286
|--
(sighs)

29:59.464 --> 30:00.624
I was just
screwing around.

30:00.799 --> 30:03.632
- Just forget it.
- (knock on door)

30:07.639 --> 30:09.630
(sighs)
Come in.

30:11.059 --> 30:13.550
I'm sorry to interrupt,
sir, but, uh...

30:13.728 --> 30:16.765
you left Lucille
out by the truck.

30:16.940 --> 30:18.646
Seriously?

30:19.651 --> 30:20.982
I never do that.

30:21.152 --> 30:23.108
I guess a kid
firing a machine gun

30:23.279 --> 30:25.816
is a little bit
of a distraction.

30:27.659 --> 30:33.074
All jokes aside,
you look rad as hell.

30:33.248 --> 30:34.863
I wouldn't
cover that shit up.

30:35.041 --> 30:37.703
It may not be a hit
with the ladies,

30:37.877 --> 30:39.287
but I swear to you,

30:39.462 --> 30:42.499
no one is gonna screw with you
looking like that.

30:42.674 --> 30:44.335
No, sir.

30:48.179 --> 30:52.172
Fat Joseph, did you carry her
all the way up here for me?

30:52.350 --> 30:53.556
Yes, sir.

31:01.442 --> 31:02.648
Were you gentle?

31:02.819 --> 31:04.104
Were you kind?

31:04.279 --> 31:05.689
Uh...

31:05.864 --> 31:09.448
Did you treat her
like a lady?

31:09.617 --> 31:12.233
Mm, yes.
Yes, sir.

31:13.705 --> 31:16.947
Did you pet her little pussy
like a lady?

31:18.710 --> 31:21.622
(chuckles)

31:21.796 --> 31:22.831
I'm just screwing around,
man.

31:23.006 --> 31:24.621
A baseball bat
doesn't have a pussy.

31:24.799 --> 31:25.788
(Negan chuckles)

31:25.967 --> 31:28.458
(laughs)

31:28.636 --> 31:31.548
Get the hell out.

31:32.807 --> 31:34.172
(door closes)

31:34.350 --> 31:35.556
Now, you see?

31:35.727 --> 31:38.639
That's what
I'm talking about.

31:38.813 --> 31:41.805
Men breaking
each other's balls.

31:41.983 --> 31:47.728
This is the shit your dad's
supposed to be teaching you.

31:48.990 --> 31:50.571
(sighs)

31:50.742 --> 31:54.326
What do you like
to do for fun?

31:54.495 --> 31:56.406
You like music?

32:01.920 --> 32:04.332
I want you
to sing me a song.

32:05.381 --> 32:06.666
What?

32:06.841 --> 32:08.081
Yeah.

32:08.259 --> 32:11.046
You mowed down two of my men
with a machine gun.

32:11.220 --> 32:15.634
I want something
in return for that.

32:15.808 --> 32:17.389
Sing me a song.

32:20.605 --> 32:22.641
|-- I can't think
of any.

32:22.815 --> 32:24.601
Bullshit!

32:24.776 --> 32:28.109
What'd your mom
used to sing you?

32:28.279 --> 32:30.361
What'd your dad
play in the car?

32:40.291 --> 32:41.872
Start singing.

32:42.043 --> 32:43.374
Okay, okay.

32:43.544 --> 32:45.535
Okay.

32:45.713 --> 32:47.795
Uh...

32:54.639 --> 32:57.472
J‘ You are my sunshine... J‘

32:57.642 --> 33:00.304
Go on.

33:00.478 --> 33:02.719
J‘ My only sunshine J‘

33:02.897 --> 33:07.140
J‘ You make me happy J‘

33:07.318 --> 33:10.310
J‘ When skies are gray... J‘

33:10.488 --> 33:12.854
(grunts)

33:13.032 --> 33:18.152
Do not let me distract you,
young man.

33:18.329 --> 33:19.830
J‘ You'll... J‘

33:19.998 --> 33:21.363
J‘ Never know... J‘

33:21.541 --> 33:23.748
- (grunts)
- J‘ ...dear J“

33:23.918 --> 33:26.830
J‘ How much I love you J‘

33:27.005 --> 33:28.666
J‘ So... J‘

33:28.840 --> 33:31.673
J‘ Please don't take my... J‘

33:31.843 --> 33:34.004
J‘ Sunshine away. J‘

33:36.848 --> 33:38.588
That's pretty good.

33:38.766 --> 33:41.678
Lucille loves
being sung to.

33:43.021 --> 33:45.512
It's about the only thing
she loves more

33:45.690 --> 33:48.352
than bashing in brains.

33:48.526 --> 33:51.689
Weird, huh?

33:59.704 --> 34:02.616
Did your mother
sing that to you?

34:02.790 --> 34:04.166
Where is she now?

34:05.960 --> 34:07.871
(sniffles)

34:08.046 --> 34:10.412
Damn.

34:11.966 --> 34:13.547
Dead,huh?

34:16.888 --> 34:18.549
You see it happen?

34:18.723 --> 34:20.884
(sniffles)

34:21.059 --> 34:23.471
I shot her...

34:23.644 --> 34:26.556
before it could...

34:28.941 --> 34:33.059
Damn, no wonder you're a little
serial killer in the making.

34:35.740 --> 34:39.073
That was an example
of breaking balls, by the way.

34:45.750 --> 34:47.991
Come on, kid.
Get up.

34:48.169 --> 34:50.581
It should be ready.

34:50.755 --> 34:53.167
What should be ready?

34:54.759 --> 34:56.169
The iron.

35:01.516 --> 35:04.553
(indistinct conversations)

35:05.770 --> 35:08.136
(Lucille clanging)

35:20.743 --> 35:22.779
Hold that for me.

35:29.794 --> 35:31.705
You know the deal.

35:32.755 --> 35:36.339
What's about to happen
is gonna be hard to watch.

35:37.385 --> 35:39.717
I don't want to do it.

35:39.887 --> 35:42.799
I wish I could just ignore
the rules and let it slide,

35:42.974 --> 35:44.635
but I can't.

35:46.144 --> 35:47.304
Why?

35:47.478 --> 35:51.687
All:
The rules keep us alive.

35:51.858 --> 35:55.817
Negan:
Thatuis".ﬁght

35:57.989 --> 35:59.479
We survive.

35:59.657 --> 36:02.820
We provide security to others.

36:02.994 --> 36:06.737
We bring civilization
back to this world.

36:06.914 --> 36:11.157
We are the Saviors.

36:13.838 --> 36:16.500
But we can't do that
without rules.

36:16.674 --> 36:20.258
Rules are what make it all work.

36:20.428 --> 36:23.920
I know it's not easy.

36:24.098 --> 36:25.838
But there's always work.

36:26.017 --> 36:29.100
There is always a cost.

36:29.270 --> 36:32.854
Here, if you try to skirt it,

36:33.024 --> 36:36.391
if you try to cut that corner...

36:39.280 --> 36:41.692
(chuckles)

36:43.201 --> 36:45.943
...then it is the iron for you.

36:54.921 --> 36:56.582
On your feet.

37:10.853 --> 37:13.390
D...

37:13.564 --> 37:17.056
(chuckles)

37:31.290 --> 37:34.532
Mark... I'm sorry.

37:34.710 --> 37:38.453
But it is what it is.

37:41.300 --> 37:43.461
(whispers indistinctly)

37:54.647 --> 37:58.936
(Mark screaming)

38:17.878 --> 38:20.290
(chuckles)

38:21.424 --> 38:24.006
Ah, that wasn't so bad now,
was it?

38:28.889 --> 38:30.049
Jesus.

38:30.224 --> 38:32.886
He pissed himself.

38:41.235 --> 38:42.816
Clean that up.

38:48.367 --> 38:50.153
Doc, I'm all done.

38:50.328 --> 38:52.444
Do yourthing.

38:57.668 --> 39:00.205
Well, the pussy passed out.

39:02.173 --> 39:03.583
But it's settled--
we're square.

39:03.758 --> 39:06.545
Everything is cool.

39:06.719 --> 39:10.211
Let Mark's face
be a daily reminder to him

39:10.389 --> 39:14.723
and to everyone else
that the rules matter.

39:18.439 --> 39:21.602
I hope that we all
learned something today,

39:21.776 --> 39:26.270
because I don't ever
want to have to do that again.

39:34.872 --> 39:36.863
Some crazy shit,
huh?

39:37.041 --> 39:39.748
You probably think
I'm a lunatic.

39:40.961 --> 39:43.998
Come on. Let's go figure out
what to do with you.

39:56.811 --> 39:59.302
(walker growling)

40:08.948 --> 40:10.813
(hook clangs)

40:10.991 --> 40:13.573
(stand rattling)

40:13.744 --> 40:16.156
(growling continues)

40:16.330 --> 40:20.744
(music playing)

40:22.002 --> 40:25.290
(grunting)

40:33.013 --> 40:36.255
(stand creaking)

40:45.526 --> 40:46.936
(walker thuds)

41:49.048 --> 41:50.788
I didn't want
to come back here.

41:50.966 --> 41:52.342
I don't...

41:59.850 --> 42:02.227
No.

42:04.063 --> 42:05.849
I asked you
to make me a bullet.

42:07.274 --> 42:08.525
You said yes.

42:09.610 --> 42:10.850
So make me a bullet.

42:11.028 --> 42:13.690
You're right.
I said yes.

42:13.864 --> 42:15.024
But that...

42:15.199 --> 42:16.939
was peak
heat of the moment.

42:17.117 --> 42:20.359
Uh, in the intervening hours,
I've been taking a deep dive

42:20.538 --> 42:22.745
into other options
and contingencies,

42:22.915 --> 42:24.701
trying to game out
any iteration

42:24.875 --> 42:28.367
in which charging into
this enterprise makes any sense.

42:30.381 --> 42:34.124
I'm not trying
to definitively stop ya.

42:34.301 --> 42:37.043
Just maybe
slow your roll.

42:37.221 --> 42:38.757
Maybe go on
for some Iullin',

42:38.931 --> 42:40.387
false sense
of security-wise.

42:40.558 --> 42:43.015
- I'm not waiting, Eugene.
- That's just being stupid.

42:43.185 --> 42:45.597
Pendejo, you don't know what
the hell you're talking about.

42:45.771 --> 42:48.262
I think I do.

42:48.440 --> 42:51.147
I've analyzed this
top to bottom.

42:51.318 --> 42:53.058
It doesn't matter
if you're stealthy,

42:53.237 --> 42:54.443
snipey, gun, or knifey.

42:54.613 --> 42:58.322
Abraham was right--
they have the numbers.

42:58.492 --> 42:59.902
His ballgame,
unless we put together

43:00.077 --> 43:01.408
a finishing move
for a force of many,

43:01.579 --> 43:03.160
along with the man
in charge.

43:03.330 --> 43:04.661
A single bullet
ain't gonna do it.

43:04.832 --> 43:06.493
Best case,
maybe you take him out.

43:06.667 --> 43:08.328
Then make me a bullet.

43:08.502 --> 43:10.584
Somebody has to
pay the price.

43:12.256 --> 43:13.996
Even if you're willing...

43:15.134 --> 43:17.841
from all we've seen,
it's not a lock you'll be the one.

43:18.012 --> 43:22.346
Will the man who killed the man
who saved our lives die?

43:22.516 --> 43:25.098
- Maybe.
- Then make me a bullet.

43:25.269 --> 43:28.181
You're not talking me
out of this, Eugene!

43:28.355 --> 43:30.346
You owe me,
and you owe him.

43:30.524 --> 43:33.140
And if there's a price,
I'll pay it.

43:33.319 --> 43:36.732
But don't you
tell me no.

43:38.115 --> 43:39.446
You don't know anything.

43:39.617 --> 43:42.825
You don't do anything.

43:42.995 --> 43:45.202
You're a coward.

43:45.372 --> 43:47.784
And you're weak.

43:47.958 --> 43:49.789
The only reason
you're alive

43:49.960 --> 43:53.452
is because you lied and because
people feel sorry for you.

43:59.136 --> 44:02.094
So, for once...

44:02.264 --> 44:04.846
do something useful...

44:07.603 --> 44:10.686
...and make me a bullet.

44:33.253 --> 44:34.663
(door creaks, closes)

44:45.516 --> 44:48.007
(sighs)

44:59.363 --> 45:02.196
(sighs)

45:05.035 --> 45:07.151
Don't beat yourself up.

45:07.329 --> 45:08.489
Why would I?

45:08.664 --> 45:10.370
He--

45:10.541 --> 45:14.375
he asked you
about Mark and Amber,

45:14.545 --> 45:16.536
and you sold 'em out,
right?

45:18.549 --> 45:20.210
You had to.

45:21.635 --> 45:23.717
That's not
what happened.

45:29.727 --> 45:32.218
Whatever helps you
sleep at night.

45:40.738 --> 45:42.023
How do you
sleep at night?

45:42.197 --> 45:43.903
I don't.

45:44.074 --> 45:47.407
I watch TV
straight to the morning.

45:51.498 --> 45:53.830
When we made
that deal with him,

45:54.001 --> 45:55.616
that was us
deciding something.

45:55.794 --> 45:57.409
This was only
supposed to affect us.

45:57.588 --> 45:58.998
No.

45:59.173 --> 46:01.004
If you're
still standing,

46:01.175 --> 46:04.588
then it's always
on somebody else's back.

46:10.601 --> 46:13.434
You should go.
Someone's going to see us.

46:13.604 --> 46:15.435
We're not doing anything.

46:16.774 --> 46:20.107
No.
We're not.

46:25.282 --> 46:26.943
(door opens)

46:32.706 --> 46:34.913
Can I wrap up
my face now?

46:35.083 --> 46:37.369
No,
you absolutely cannot.

46:37.544 --> 46:39.375
Why the hell not?!

46:39.546 --> 46:42.834
(chuckles)
Look at this badass.

46:44.092 --> 46:47.084
You can't
because I'm not done with you.

46:47.262 --> 46:49.969
And I like
looking at your disgusting,

46:50.140 --> 46:54.474
rad-ass, badass eye,
so it's staying out.

46:57.272 --> 46:58.648
What?

46:58.816 --> 47:02.058
You got something
to say?

47:02.236 --> 47:05.069
Why haven't you killed me?

47:05.239 --> 47:07.195
Or my dad or Daryl?

47:09.159 --> 47:11.115
Daryl...

47:11.286 --> 47:14.073
is gonna make
a good soldier for me.

47:14.248 --> 47:17.661
You see, he thinks
he's holding it together...

47:17.835 --> 47:19.996
but you saw it.

47:20.170 --> 47:21.410
Yourdad?

47:21.588 --> 47:24.170
He's already
getting me great stuff.

47:24.341 --> 47:27.208
You,
on the other hand...

47:28.929 --> 47:33.172
well, we shall see.

47:34.685 --> 47:37.848
It's more productive
to break you.

47:38.021 --> 47:40.433
More fun, too.

47:40.607 --> 47:43.519
You thinking that's stupid?

47:43.694 --> 47:45.605
I'm thinking
we're different.

47:45.779 --> 47:48.862
Mm.

47:50.367 --> 47:52.358
You're a smart kid.

47:53.537 --> 47:55.698
What do you think
I should do?

47:55.873 --> 47:59.365
You know
I can't let you go.

47:59.543 --> 48:01.579
So, do I kill you?

48:01.753 --> 48:03.584
Iron your face?

48:03.755 --> 48:06.041
Chop off your arm?

48:06.216 --> 48:07.296
Tell me.

48:07.467 --> 48:09.719
What do you think?

48:11.305 --> 48:12.465
I think
you should jump out the window

48:12.639 --> 48:14.721
to save me the trouble
of killing you.

48:17.644 --> 48:19.509
(chuckles)

48:19.688 --> 48:21.724
Oh!

48:21.899 --> 48:25.767
Now, there is the kid that
impressed the hell out of me.

48:27.738 --> 48:29.603
I think you're not saying
what you're gonna do to me

48:29.781 --> 48:31.521
because you're not
going to do anything.

48:31.700 --> 48:34.908
If you knew us,
if you knew anything,

48:35.078 --> 48:36.158
you would kill us.

48:38.540 --> 48:41.077
But you can't.

48:41.251 --> 48:42.457
Hoo.

48:43.754 --> 48:46.461
Maybe you're right.

48:46.632 --> 48:48.748
Maybe I can't.

48:52.262 --> 48:53.593
(claps hands)

48:53.764 --> 48:56.005
Let's go for a ride,
kid.

48:59.353 --> 49:02.595
(walkers growling)

49:18.455 --> 49:19.865
Daryl!

49:24.544 --> 49:26.830
You seem worried,
so I'm taking the kid home.

49:27.005 --> 49:28.620
If you do anything
to him--

49:28.799 --> 49:30.460
Dwight!

49:32.302 --> 49:33.633
Daryl needs a time-out.

49:33.804 --> 49:36.466
Put him back in his box
for a while.

49:45.899 --> 49:48.811
(engine starts)

50:05.752 --> 50:08.585
(door opens)

50:14.678 --> 50:17.920
(footsteps approach)

50:26.982 --> 50:30.440
(footsteps depart)

50:34.865 --> 50:38.107
(door closes)

51:08.815 --> 51:11.101
(engine shuts off)

51:37.803 --> 51:41.045
(footsteps approach)

51:42.599 --> 51:46.091
Michonne: Drop it.

51:48.772 --> 51:51.104
Your knife, too.

51:54.945 --> 51:56.025
(knife clatters)

51:56.196 --> 51:58.778
What next?
You want my shoes?

52:01.118 --> 52:03.109
Take me to Negan.

52:18.885 --> 52:20.967
Start it up.
Let's go.

52:22.806 --> 52:26.970
(engine starts)

52:28.228 --> 52:29.889
(tires screech)

52:30.063 --> 52:32.395
Aah!

52:32.566 --> 52:34.727
Aah!

52:34.901 --> 52:36.311
Aah!

52:36.486 --> 52:38.898
(breathing heavily)

52:44.828 --> 52:46.113
(grunts)

52:51.585 --> 52:55.169
Take me... to Negan.

52:55.338 --> 52:56.498
(knock on door)

53:01.845 --> 53:04.006
(door creaks)

53:05.849 --> 53:09.012
(whistling)

53:09.186 --> 53:10.892
- Carl, where's--
- Enid's fine.

53:11.062 --> 53:14.850
Great, great, great,
great, great, great!

53:15.025 --> 53:16.640
Where's Rick?

53:16.818 --> 53:18.354
Uh, l--

53:18.528 --> 53:20.860
- I'm just--
- J“ Don't care. J‘

53:21.031 --> 53:22.191
Where's Rick?

53:24.034 --> 53:26.821
Um, out scavenging
for you.

53:26.995 --> 53:28.485
Cool.

53:28.663 --> 53:29.948
I'll wait.

53:31.208 --> 53:34.120
Um... he went out
pretty far.

53:34.294 --> 53:37.081
They might not
be back today.

53:37.255 --> 53:39.041
We're running really low
on everything.

53:39.216 --> 53:41.252
We're practically
starving here.

53:43.094 --> 53:45.551
Starving?

53:47.724 --> 53:48.884
You?

53:49.059 --> 53:52.972
By "practically,"
you mean "not really."

53:58.860 --> 54:00.646
(crying)

54:00.820 --> 54:02.902
(chuckles)

54:03.073 --> 54:04.779
Really?

54:04.950 --> 54:06.156
(sobs)

54:06.326 --> 54:11.491
You people seriously
don't have a sense of humor.

54:11.665 --> 54:13.576
(sighs)

54:16.920 --> 54:18.751
Excuse me.

54:21.258 --> 54:24.091
What's your name again?

54:24.261 --> 54:26.172
Olivia.

54:26.346 --> 54:28.052
Right.

54:28.223 --> 54:30.305
Olivia.

54:38.984 --> 54:43.774
lam sorry for having been
so rude to you just now.

54:43.947 --> 54:46.279
And it looks like
I'm gonna be here for a while,

54:46.449 --> 54:50.112
awaiting
your fearless leader's return.

54:50.287 --> 54:53.199
And if you'd like...

54:53.373 --> 54:55.580
I think
it would be enjoyable...

54:55.750 --> 54:58.207
to screw
your brains out.

54:58.378 --> 55:01.461
I mean, if, you know,
you're agreeable to it.

55:15.228 --> 55:18.641
I am about 50%
more into you now.

55:20.775 --> 55:22.561
Just sayin'.

55:26.072 --> 55:27.357
(chuckles)

55:29.409 --> 55:31.821
All right, well,
I'm just gonna put my feet up

55:31.995 --> 55:34.953
and wait for my stuff
to get here.

55:35.123 --> 55:36.659
Olivia...

55:36.833 --> 55:40.667
would you be a lamb
and make us a little lemonade?

55:40.837 --> 55:43.169
Now, I know I left you all
some of that good powdered stuff.

55:43.340 --> 55:44.830
Well, I'm supposed to
be with--

55:45.008 --> 55:46.669
Make it.

55:50.180 --> 55:51.920
Make it.

55:52.098 --> 55:54.840
Take your time.

55:55.018 --> 55:56.849
Make it good.

56:07.322 --> 56:08.653
All right, kid!

56:08.823 --> 56:10.779
Take me
on the grand tour.

56:10.950 --> 56:15.535
("Bang Bang" plays)

56:15.705 --> 56:18.196
J‘ I'll trade you my heart
for your heart, baby J“

56:18.375 --> 56:20.286
J‘ Give you all my kisses
to boot J‘

56:20.460 --> 56:23.202
J‘ I'll trade you my heart
for your heart, baby J“

56:23.380 --> 56:25.041
J‘ Give you all my kisses
to boot J‘

56:25.215 --> 56:28.048
J‘ If you feel you'd like
to make a deal J“

56:28.218 --> 56:30.209
J‘ Cock your pistol
and rooty-toot-toot J‘

56:30.387 --> 56:34.050
J‘ Bang bang bang bang,
bang-bang-bang... J‘

56:34.224 --> 56:35.634
- Negan: How about this one?
- J‘ Bang bang bangedy-bang-bang... J‘

56:35.809 --> 56:37.015
Carl: Oh, i-it's just
a water heater--

56:37.185 --> 56:39.050
Are you serious, kid?
Come on.

56:40.230 --> 56:42.221
J‘ Bang bang bang J‘

56:42.399 --> 56:46.893
- J‘ Bang bang bang bangedy-bang... J‘
- Oh-ho, my.

56:47.070 --> 56:49.903
J‘ Bang bang bang... J‘

56:50.073 --> 56:54.567
- Look at this little angel.
- J“ Bang bang bang J‘

56:54.744 --> 56:56.905
J‘ Bangedy-bang... J‘

56:57.080 --> 56:58.741
Oh.

56:58.915 --> 57:00.030
(whimpers)

57:00.208 --> 57:02.950
- J‘ Bang bangedy-bang... J‘
- (chuckles)

57:34.534 --> 57:36.866
This guy-- he's armed.

57:37.036 --> 57:39.448
Has food,
supplies, ammo.

57:48.298 --> 57:50.789
"The only way that
you have possibly read this far

57:50.967 --> 57:54.209
without being shot
is that lam dead."

58:07.400 --> 58:10.642
(walkers growling)

58:14.741 --> 58:17.904
Aaron: Looks like
he protected his supplies.

58:18.077 --> 58:20.534
Rick: Looks like
they're still protected.

58:23.082 --> 58:25.164
Today and only today,
right?

58:28.004 --> 58:29.995
Yeah.

58:48.274 --> 58:50.014
Thank you.

58:53.530 --> 58:54.861
I'm sorry
for what I said.

58:55.031 --> 58:56.066
l reject that.

58:56.241 --> 58:57.856
(scoffs)
I am sorry.

58:58.034 --> 58:59.945
No.

59:00.119 --> 59:03.862
Maybe the words,
but not the intent.

59:04.040 --> 59:06.452
You sound sincere,
but it's just a flea circus.

59:06.626 --> 59:07.866
You got
what you wanted.

59:08.044 --> 59:09.830
This is just
you feeling bad

59:10.004 --> 59:11.710
and not saying that
you didn't mean what you said.

59:13.091 --> 59:14.922
That's your truth.

59:15.093 --> 59:16.754
Eugene...

59:16.928 --> 59:19.214
I'd like to take it back
to awkward silence now.

59:38.449 --> 59:39.734
Find what you wanted?

59:39.909 --> 59:41.410
Rosita:
Did just fine.

59:43.246 --> 59:46.784
Yeah, me too.

59:51.087 --> 59:53.248
Where did you
acquire all this?

59:56.092 --> 59:57.957
(chuckles)
Latin.

59:58.136 --> 59:59.922
It was
a pain-in-the-ass class.

1:00:00.096 --> 1:00:03.509
My mom said that pain
would be useful someday.

1:00:03.683 --> 1:00:06.971
It's a list of caches
from a dead guy with a plan.

1:00:07.145 --> 1:00:10.262
Dug up medical supplies,
water purifiers, flares...

1:00:10.440 --> 1:00:12.897
And you're just gonna
give it all to them.

1:00:13.067 --> 1:00:17.481
That's what Rick
wants us to do, right?

1:00:19.032 --> 1:00:21.444
So that's what
I'm gonna do.

1:00:21.618 --> 1:00:23.859
I'm gonna do
more than that.

1:00:24.037 --> 1:00:25.152
(whistles)

1:00:25.330 --> 1:00:26.866
(gate unlocks)

1:00:27.040 --> 1:00:30.282
(music playing)

1:00:46.059 --> 1:00:48.300
They're here.

1:00:48.478 --> 1:00:50.469
He's here.

1:00:50.647 --> 1:00:53.013
(Negan humming)

1:00:53.191 --> 1:00:56.524
Oh, this little girl
is precious.

1:00:58.154 --> 1:00:59.894
(humming)

1:01:00.073 --> 1:01:01.654
Hey, neighbor.

1:01:02.659 --> 1:01:04.149
Why don't you
come by later?

1:01:04.327 --> 1:01:08.491
We might grill out.
(chuckles)

1:01:08.665 --> 1:01:12.157
Oh, I like it here.

1:01:12.335 --> 1:01:13.495
Mm-hmm.

1:01:13.670 --> 1:01:16.662
I might just
have to stay here.

1:01:18.633 --> 1:01:22.171
You know, I was thinking
about what you said earlier, Carl.

1:01:24.347 --> 1:01:29.057
Maybe it is stupid
keeping you and your dad alive.

1:01:29.227 --> 1:01:33.140
I mean,
why am I trying so hard?

1:01:33.314 --> 1:01:35.475
Maybe I should just
bury you both

1:01:35.650 --> 1:01:39.268
down in
one of those flower beds.

1:01:39.445 --> 1:01:41.060
Huh?
(chuckles)

1:01:42.615 --> 1:01:45.357
And then I could just settle
into the suburbs.

1:01:45.535 --> 1:01:47.071
What do you think
about that?

1:01:53.251 --> 1:01:57.335
(music playing)
