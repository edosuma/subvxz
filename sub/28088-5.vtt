00:36.088 --> 00:39.003
I seen Winston earlier.

00:39.003 --> 00:40.070
Oh, did ye?

00:40.072 --> 00:42.084
Was he with his good lady companion?

00:42.084 --> 00:45.042
CHUCKLES
He was!

00:45.042 --> 00:47.094
That's a couple of months noo.
Aye, aye.

00:47.094 --> 00:49.042
They're a good couple, aren't they?

00:49.042 --> 00:52.000
Aye, they're a nice match.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.048
Did you get the rolls?
Did I get the rolls?!

00:55.048 --> 00:58.079
Does a bear take a big honking fetid
crap in the woods?

01:00.008 --> 01:01.064
I'm no' sure I'm wantin' a roll noo.

01:01.064 --> 01:03.008
Me neither, oddly.

01:03.008 --> 01:05.043
FOOTSTEPS

01:05.043 --> 01:07.012
Andy Forrester?Andy!

01:08.078 --> 01:10.084
Hello, Jack, Victor.

01:10.084 --> 01:12.055
No' seen you for the longest time.

01:12.055 --> 01:14.084
Are you still working
in the People's Palace?

01:14.084 --> 01:16.063
Aye. That's 30 year.

01:16.063 --> 01:20.022
Of course, I'm the curator there
now.

01:20.024 --> 01:21.084
Oh, Andy Forrester, Curator.

01:21.084 --> 01:23.066
LAUGHS
You've climbed high.

01:23.066 --> 01:26.012
Uh-huh.
What is a curator?

01:26.012 --> 01:28.052
Forgive my friend, Andy.

01:28.052 --> 01:30.024
His ignorance knows no bounds.

01:30.024 --> 01:32.072
Awright, then, smart arse,
what is a curator?

01:32.072 --> 01:34.000
Well, he...

01:34.000 --> 01:36.031
..he cures things and that, you
know.

01:36.031 --> 01:38.012
Generally...curating.

01:38.012 --> 01:41.036
For the museum.
In his capacity as...curator.

01:41.036 --> 01:44.063
You don't know what it is either,
do you? Naw.Naw.

01:44.063 --> 01:49.000
Andy, would you care to enlighten
my dim-witted friend and myself?

01:49.000 --> 01:53.007
The curator deals
with the acquisition of items

01:53.007 --> 01:54.048
throughout the country

01:54.048 --> 01:58.016
that would be of interest or
importance to the viewing public.

01:58.016 --> 02:00.060
Very impressive, aye.

02:00.060 --> 02:02.048
See when the place is shut,

02:02.048 --> 02:05.052
you know, like that Night At The
Museum, do you run aboot daft?

02:05.052 --> 02:07.007
Aye, do you ever lock up at night

02:07.007 --> 02:10.024
and run aboot in Billy Connolly's
big banana boots?

02:10.024 --> 02:11.026
No.

02:11.026 --> 02:12.084
Those boots are a national treasure!

02:12.084 --> 02:14.072
Right you are, OK.
Aye, very good.

02:14.072 --> 02:17.008
Well, I must be going.

02:17.008 --> 02:19.080
Unlike your good selves,
I can't afford myself the luxury

02:19.080 --> 02:21.096
of sitting around
doing nothing in a park all day.

02:21.096 --> 02:24.056
Well, aye,
it was good to see you anyway, Andy.

02:24.056 --> 02:26.051
Aw the best.

02:29.068 --> 02:33.036
Christ, bit of a snooty bastard,
him, wasn't he?

02:33.036 --> 02:35.008
He used to be a good laugh tae.

02:35.008 --> 02:37.048
That was a right boot in the balls
at the end there he gave us,

02:37.048 --> 02:38.096
was it no'?What?

02:38.096 --> 02:41.038
"Well, unlike you,
I can't afford myself the luxury

02:41.038 --> 02:43.067
"of hingin' aboot in a park,
daein' nothin'."

02:43.068 --> 02:45.056
That was directed at us!

02:45.056 --> 02:48.048
Cheeky, lofty, curating-faced
bastard!

02:48.048 --> 02:49.092
What are we doing?

02:50.092 --> 02:52.012
Eh, nothin'.

02:57.096 --> 02:59.092
What have ye got?

02:59.092 --> 03:01.072
Chopper Fantasy.

03:01.072 --> 03:03.044
Ooft. 40 to 1?

03:03.044 --> 03:05.048
And it doesnae even like soft
ground.

03:05.048 --> 03:09.002
Chopper? I think you're fantasising!

03:09.002 --> 03:11.072
Naw, it's no' aboot the nags for me.

03:11.072 --> 03:14.080
You see, in this establishment,
I'm drawn to the outsiders.

03:14.080 --> 03:18.074
Because on the rare occasion
that one of these horses comes in,

03:18.074 --> 03:21.062
I get a chance to put a look
on that man's face

03:21.062 --> 03:24.096
like he's just been shot
through the foreheid wi' an arrow,

03:24.096 --> 03:27.026
only to find a tax bill attached.

03:27.026 --> 03:30.055
And it's worth
every crumpled-up bookie's slip

03:30.056 --> 03:32.014
waiting on that tae happen.

03:32.014 --> 03:33.091
TV:Here they come to the finish.

03:33.092 --> 03:36.044
And it's Chopper Fantasy by
a nose!Yes!

03:36.044 --> 03:38.056
LAUGHS

03:38.056 --> 03:41.002
Oh, come on, Winnie, my love.

03:41.002 --> 03:42.031
Tax bill time!

03:46.026 --> 03:48.062
SMACKS LIPS
Hello, Stevie.

03:48.062 --> 03:50.060
Hello, Winston.

03:50.060 --> 03:52.050
This is my lady friend, Winnie.

03:52.050 --> 03:54.079
Hello, Winnie.
Hello.

03:54.080 --> 03:57.056
Welcome to my bookie's shop
establishment.

03:57.056 --> 04:00.026
Yes, blah-blah-blah,
down to business.

04:00.026 --> 04:03.086
Now, it's funny that my lady
companion should be called Winnie,

04:03.086 --> 04:05.060
because as fate would have it,

04:05.060 --> 04:08.000
I myself have had a wee winnie.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.084
THEY LAUGH

04:15.048 --> 04:16.096
Â£10.

04:16.096 --> 04:18.028
40 to 1.

04:18.028 --> 04:21.067
That's Â£410

04:21.067 --> 04:24.074
from your bookie's shop
establishment till.

04:24.076 --> 04:27.043
Of course.

04:27.043 --> 04:29.072
That's how it works.

04:29.072 --> 04:31.052
Hooray.

04:31.052 --> 04:33.004
CHUCKLES

04:33.004 --> 04:36.091
And you, my dear, are tasked with
finding us somewhere nice for lunch.

04:36.091 --> 04:38.002
Oh!

04:38.004 --> 04:39.019
Nothing cheap, mind.

04:39.019 --> 04:41.024
White Dove Bistro?

04:41.024 --> 04:42.084
Oh, yes!

04:42.084 --> 04:45.007
O-ho-ho.

04:45.007 --> 04:47.060
Always a pleasure, Stevie.

04:47.060 --> 04:50.040
Any time. Hurry back now.

04:50.040 --> 04:52.043
He seems like a lovely fella.

04:52.043 --> 04:55.019
You said he was a black-hearted,
torn-faced wanker!

04:57.012 --> 04:59.007
WINSTON: Ho-ho-ho-ho!

04:59.007 --> 05:01.014
Would you like anything else
to drink at all?

05:01.016 --> 05:02.055
Whatever the lady wants.

05:02.055 --> 05:04.050
Oh, no, nothing for me, thanks.

05:04.052 --> 05:05.079
I'm driving.

05:05.079 --> 05:08.007
LAUGHS

05:08.007 --> 05:10.007
I've never had lobster before.

05:10.007 --> 05:12.024
I dunno whether to eat it
or start fighting it.

05:13.040 --> 05:18.088
Oh, I've had it everywhere.
America, Canada, oh, Seychelles.

05:18.088 --> 05:21.004
You were very well travelled,
weren't you?

05:21.004 --> 05:23.067
Aye. But after John died, then
this...

05:23.067 --> 05:25.048
But you don't need all that.

05:25.048 --> 05:29.016
At the end of the day, you
cannae beat a good bit of company.

05:29.016 --> 05:30.067
Aye, well,

05:30.067 --> 05:33.026
I'll have a wee look roond
and see if I can find some for you.

05:33.028 --> 05:35.004
Oh, yeah!
LAUGHS

05:35.004 --> 05:37.040
See these last couple of months,
Winnie?

05:37.040 --> 05:38.060
Uh-huh?

05:38.060 --> 05:41.000
They've been the best couple of
months I've had in...

05:41.000 --> 05:42.096
SIGHS
..years.

05:42.096 --> 05:44.091
Me too, Winston.

05:50.016 --> 05:53.040
A strange creature, the lobster,
in't it?

05:53.040 --> 05:58.028
Look at that -
the red body and the big red heid.

05:58.028 --> 06:01.052
If I'm bein' honest,
I don't see the attraction.

06:01.052 --> 06:03.091
GIGGLES
I do.

06:06.060 --> 06:08.043
WINSTON LAUGHS

06:08.043 --> 06:09.072
Right enough.

06:09.072 --> 06:11.067
Will you marry me?

06:11.067 --> 06:13.031
What?!
LOBSTER CRACKS

06:17.028 --> 06:20.084
Oh, there he is! Love's auld dream!

06:20.084 --> 06:23.007
Two goldies, please, Boabby.

06:23.007 --> 06:24.096
Right, what's the matter wi' your
face?

06:24.096 --> 06:26.060
I asked Winnie to marry me.

06:26.060 --> 06:28.060
Aww.

06:28.060 --> 06:30.064
Got a knock-back, yeah?

06:30.064 --> 06:32.060
The old KB.

06:32.060 --> 06:35.055
The old knocko-backo.

06:36.072 --> 06:37.088
Here.

06:37.088 --> 06:39.072
Drown yer sorrows.

06:40.079 --> 06:42.026
Here's one on me.

06:48.048 --> 06:49.076
She said yes.

06:51.043 --> 06:52.086
So here's one on you.

06:54.055 --> 06:57.007
Oh! Look at you, Boabby,
yer soakin'!

06:57.007 --> 07:00.019
The old SF, the old soako face-o!

07:01.024 --> 07:03.024
Good for you, Winston.
She's brilliant.

07:03.024 --> 07:04.052
Aye.

07:04.052 --> 07:06.052
Ten days' time.

07:06.052 --> 07:09.000
Well, that's quite quick.
What, is she pregnant?

07:09.000 --> 07:11.036
I'll knock you out.

07:14.019 --> 07:16.031
Nae point in wasting time at oor
age.

07:16.031 --> 07:17.062
Oh, quite right.

07:19.016 --> 07:20.072
So why's your face trippin' ye?

07:20.072 --> 07:24.000
Well, I've pumped Stevie
for 410 quid...

07:24.000 --> 07:25.024
Is that yer going rate, aye?

07:25.024 --> 07:27.064
Shut up, you, or you'll be wearing
the pint an' all.

07:28.067 --> 07:31.002
So I came oot the bookie's,
and I'm feeling like Samson...

07:31.004 --> 07:33.024
Who, Willie Sampson
with the neck lump and the breath?

07:33.024 --> 07:35.055
No, Samson oot the Bible!

07:35.055 --> 07:37.048
BOTH: Oh.

07:37.048 --> 07:39.019
So I've a big pocket full of money,
right?

07:39.019 --> 07:41.072
And I take her for lunch
and I ask her to marry me.

07:41.072 --> 07:43.048
And she says aye.

07:43.048 --> 07:45.064
But you need to remember, she's...

07:45.064 --> 07:48.067
..she's travelled the whole world
before her man died.

07:48.067 --> 07:50.086
And Christ knows
I cannae compete wi' that!

07:50.088 --> 07:53.048
So what did you dae?
I tried to compete with that.

07:54.076 --> 07:57.072
I had a few drinks in me, and I
started to promise her the earth.

07:57.072 --> 07:58.088
Such as?

07:58.088 --> 08:01.084
Eh, "I'll gie you the best day
of your life."

08:01.084 --> 08:07.004
And a band, and flowers,
and the whole shootin' match.

08:07.004 --> 08:09.024
What did ye dae that for,
you silly old bastard?

08:09.024 --> 08:13.088
Who am I kidding
asking anybody to marry me?

08:13.088 --> 08:16.036
What have I got to offer anybody?

08:16.036 --> 08:17.040
Nothin'.

08:25.048 --> 08:27.064
He's got himself in a hole, in't he?

08:27.064 --> 08:29.024
Aye, it's a bloody liberty, that.

08:29.024 --> 08:31.000
He never gets an even break,
does he?

08:31.000 --> 08:33.032
I mean, what's supposed to be
the happiest day in his life

08:33.032 --> 08:35.082
has ended up bein' a sore heid
for him.

08:35.082 --> 08:38.062
Well, I could dae him a deal
on a wedding reception in here.

08:38.062 --> 08:41.006
He said he wanted to gie her
a day to remember.

08:41.008 --> 08:44.034
The only thing she'd remember about
coming in here is getting dysentery.

08:44.034 --> 08:46.075
I'm only trying tae help.

08:46.076 --> 08:49.011
Where could you have
a wedding to remember?

08:51.028 --> 08:53.024
Andy Forrester.

08:53.024 --> 08:54.080
Creator.

08:54.080 --> 08:56.038
Curator, Jack.

08:56.038 --> 08:58.051
What did I say?
Creator.

08:58.052 --> 09:01.067
Oh, aye. Anyway,
we'll take care of the venue.

09:01.067 --> 09:03.028
All right, then.

09:03.028 --> 09:05.019
I can take care of the band.

09:05.019 --> 09:06.038
How's that?

09:06.038 --> 09:09.054
Well, I was a bouncer at QM Union
at Glasgow Uni back in the day.

09:09.056 --> 09:12.000
I met all the bands.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.052
Still got their numbers in my black
book.

09:14.052 --> 09:19.086
I was hangin' wi' Jim Kerr,
Midge Ure, Proclaimers.

09:19.086 --> 09:21.019
Garbage.

09:21.019 --> 09:23.058
I think The Proclaimers are quite
good!

09:25.024 --> 09:27.043
I even hung out wi' Kurt Cobain.

09:27.043 --> 09:29.062
Is that why he shot hisself?

09:36.019 --> 09:40.058
Right, son, just go in there
and tell her straight.

09:40.058 --> 09:44.034
"I love you,
but I don't have a pot to piss in.

09:44.034 --> 09:47.006
"I'm a potless dick."

09:47.008 --> 09:48.072
DOORBELL RINGS

09:48.072 --> 09:51.048
Come in! It's open!

09:55.034 --> 09:57.003
Ah, there he is.

09:57.004 --> 10:00.052
Oh, they are beautiful.

10:03.024 --> 10:05.000
Now, Winnie...

10:05.000 --> 10:06.058
Uh-huh?
I've got something

10:06.058 --> 10:08.024
very important to tell you.

10:08.024 --> 10:11.019
Would it go better with a glass
of bubbly?

10:11.019 --> 10:13.004
I think so.

10:13.004 --> 10:14.058
Do me the honours.

10:14.058 --> 10:18.014
And, Winston, we never spoke
about rings.

10:18.014 --> 10:21.091
Now, I don't want anything fancy.

10:21.091 --> 10:23.082
Excellent!

10:23.082 --> 10:25.075
Because...

10:25.076 --> 10:28.024
..that will leave us more
for the honeymoon!

10:28.024 --> 10:29.096
Oh! Oh, brilliant!

10:29.096 --> 10:31.076
LAUGHS NERVOUSLY

10:34.008 --> 10:36.000
UNDER HIS BREATH
Ya potless dick!

10:36.000 --> 10:37.032
CORK POPS

10:37.032 --> 10:39.008
Ooh!

10:39.008 --> 10:41.014
So Jack and Victor know the high
heid yin

10:41.014 --> 10:43.000

10:43.000 --> 10:44.010
And?

10:44.010 --> 10:46.078
And they dae weddings in there!

10:46.080 --> 10:51.056
A freebie? Ooh, you've started
a wee party in my basement!

10:51.056 --> 10:55.019
Boabby's gonnae organise
some big fancy singer.

10:55.019 --> 10:57.078
And what are yous two daein'?
Grub and flowers.

10:57.080 --> 10:59.072
But that leaves me nothin'.

10:59.072 --> 11:01.080
Well, are you no' the best man?

11:01.080 --> 11:03.010
Aye.

11:03.010 --> 11:04.058
But he doesnae want a stag.

11:04.058 --> 11:06.043
He says he's doon
a big enough hole already.

11:06.043 --> 11:07.082
Aye.

11:07.082 --> 11:09.027
Let me dae the flowers.

11:09.028 --> 11:10.056
BOTH: Naw.

11:10.056 --> 11:13.056
How?Because you'll make
a roaring calamity of it?

11:13.056 --> 11:15.008
I will not!

11:15.008 --> 11:16.010
Aye, ye will.

11:16.010 --> 11:19.000
When was the last time
you bought Frances flowers?

11:19.000 --> 11:20.072
Frances doesnae need any flowers.

11:20.072 --> 11:22.052
She's got a perfectly good window
box.

11:22.052 --> 11:25.067
How much does
a bouquet of flowers cost, Tam?

11:25.067 --> 11:27.067
Five...

11:27.067 --> 11:28.082
..pence.

11:28.082 --> 11:30.058
A flower?

11:30.058 --> 11:32.034
What, 50p?

11:32.034 --> 11:34.095
Tell me that's for a bunch.

11:34.096 --> 11:38.028
Mair? Behave yourselves noo!

11:38.028 --> 11:42.076
Anyway, it doesnae matter what they
cost,

11:42.076 --> 11:47.067
because Winston...is my friend.

11:47.067 --> 11:49.048
Tam.

11:49.048 --> 11:50.076
Isa?

11:50.076 --> 11:53.091
Roll and sausage and
two cups of tea.

11:58.067 --> 12:00.056
Oh, there they are.

12:00.056 --> 12:02.080
The big man's boots.

12:02.080 --> 12:05.034
That is Glasgow's ruby slippers.

12:05.034 --> 12:07.014
Can I help you, boys?

12:07.014 --> 12:09.075
Yes, we'd like to have a word
with Mr Forrester.

12:11.028 --> 12:12.091
The curator?

12:12.091 --> 12:15.052
LAUGHS
Mr Forrester?

12:15.052 --> 12:17.010
What was it you called him again?

12:17.010 --> 12:18.047
The curator.

12:21.056 --> 12:24.008
Am I saying that right?
Aye, aye.

12:24.008 --> 12:26.086
Well, what's this bastard
laughin' at?

12:26.086 --> 12:30.043
LAUGHING
He's back there in his office,

12:30.043 --> 12:32.028
up tae his eyes in the curating.

12:32.028 --> 12:35.015
Curator!
LAUGHS

12:38.000 --> 12:39.032
SECURITY GUARD:Oh!

12:57.038 --> 12:58.075
CLEARS THROAT

12:58.076 --> 13:00.000
Oh!

13:03.008 --> 13:05.052
Well...

13:05.052 --> 13:08.000
This is a lovely office you have
here, Andy.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.086
Ouch ya!

13:12.024 --> 13:14.034
Thank you. Bye-bye.Bye.

13:15.062 --> 13:17.075
Hi, Clare.Hello.

13:17.076 --> 13:19.072
It's good to see you again.

13:19.072 --> 13:21.082
Again? Did we meet before?

13:21.082 --> 13:24.062
Boabby the bouncer? QM Union?

13:24.062 --> 13:26.075
Back in the day.

13:26.076 --> 13:30.052
You had that wee nickname for me?

13:30.052 --> 13:32.015
Remind me.

13:33.072 --> 13:35.008
I said to you,

13:35.008 --> 13:39.038
"Are you gonnae be singing,
# Happy Birthday # the night?"

13:39.038 --> 13:43.019
And you, quick as a flash, said,
"Shut up, ya wanker!"

13:45.082 --> 13:47.091
Boabby the Wanker.

13:47.091 --> 13:49.004
Right.

13:49.004 --> 13:50.096
Do you want me to sign this for you?

13:50.096 --> 13:53.082
No. I was back there
when it was all happening.

13:53.082 --> 13:56.003
I don't need to read aboot it.

13:56.004 --> 13:57.052
Anyway, the book's Â£18.

13:57.052 --> 13:59.067
What it was was, I was wondering

13:59.067 --> 14:02.091
if you could do a favour
for your old pal...

14:04.008 --> 14:07.024
..Boabby the Wanker, hm?

14:08.028 --> 14:09.072
Oh!

14:16.024 --> 14:19.043
See all these acquisitions
that you were telling us aboot?

14:19.043 --> 14:22.028
Did you have to acquire
this bottle of bleach?

14:22.028 --> 14:24.034
Shut up.

14:24.034 --> 14:27.062
What can I say, boys?
Caught bumming my chat.

14:27.062 --> 14:30.014
Aye, and sniffy with it, you were.

14:30.014 --> 14:31.086
You fooled us with the suit.

14:31.086 --> 14:33.048
Naw, I was going to court.

14:34.058 --> 14:37.054
My boy bit a fella's finger off
ootside a dance hall.

14:37.056 --> 14:39.072
Oh, court, aye.

14:39.072 --> 14:40.086
What did he get?

14:40.086 --> 14:42.076
I'm pretty sure it was that one.

14:44.058 --> 14:47.054
So what can I do for you?

14:47.056 --> 14:49.008
Very little, it turns oot.

14:49.008 --> 14:50.096
Unless you want to come round our
hooses

14:50.096 --> 14:52.091
and rattle round our kitchens
with a mop!

14:54.056 --> 14:58.000
No, we were gonnae ask you, you
know, in your capacity as big shot,

14:58.000 --> 15:01.019
if you could do us a turn and let
us use this place for a wedding.

15:01.019 --> 15:03.078
This place costs a fortune.
Anyway, it's fully booked.

15:06.019 --> 15:07.067
Haud on a minute.

15:07.067 --> 15:11.043
I might be able to do something for
you. Could this wedding

15:11.043 --> 15:13.024
take place at night?

15:13.024 --> 15:15.082
JANGLES KEYS

15:21.067 --> 15:23.032
Hello, Tam.

15:23.032 --> 15:25.024
Peggy! What are you daein' here?

15:25.024 --> 15:27.043
Nice to see you too, Tam.

15:27.043 --> 15:30.000
How are you and Isa getting on
with the food?

15:30.000 --> 15:31.004
Good.

15:31.004 --> 15:33.014
How are you getting on
with the flowers?

15:33.014 --> 15:34.043
Good.

15:34.043 --> 15:36.034
Getting a few ideas.

15:36.034 --> 15:39.082
Is that one of your ideas there,
Tam?

15:41.019 --> 15:42.082
Defile poor...

15:45.014 --> 15:47.014
..poor Patch's shrine?

15:47.014 --> 15:49.014
What do you take me for?

15:49.014 --> 15:51.006
Forgive me, Tam.

15:51.008 --> 15:52.087
Oh, I'll try.

15:53.091 --> 15:55.010
I'm going this way.

15:55.010 --> 15:56.071
I'm going that way.

15:56.072 --> 15:58.024
You first, then.

16:02.028 --> 16:03.056
Right.

16:18.038 --> 16:20.028
Ooft.

16:20.028 --> 16:23.014
What's the matter with you, smiler?

16:23.014 --> 16:26.010
Och, I've blown my last 20 quid
on a 100-to-1 donkey at Stevie's.

16:26.010 --> 16:27.086
I'm gubbed.

16:27.086 --> 16:29.048
Screwed. Shafted.

16:29.048 --> 16:30.056
Pumped.

16:30.056 --> 16:33.038
My paddle's away and I've popped
into Shit Creek for a pack of Polos.

16:33.038 --> 16:35.062
Oh, slow down.

16:35.062 --> 16:39.004
Before you throw yourself aff
a bridge, we have some news.

16:39.004 --> 16:42.056
Let me guess. You've won five grand
on a scratchcard, and you're gonnae

16:42.056 --> 16:45.024
gie it all to me to pay
for a wedding that I cannae have?

16:45.024 --> 16:47.076
Close, but naw.
We've organised everything for you.

16:47.076 --> 16:50.048
Everything.We've got a pal in the
People's Palace.

16:50.048 --> 16:53.008
He's gonnae let us use it as a venue
for your wedding.

16:53.008 --> 16:54.038
Wow!

16:54.038 --> 16:55.062
Boabby's getting you a band.

16:55.062 --> 16:56.075
Nae way!

16:56.076 --> 16:59.032
Peggy and Isa are gonnae dae the
food.I don't know what tae say.

16:59.032 --> 17:00.080
And Tam's daein' yer flowers.

17:00.080 --> 17:03.000
Aye, that might need a bit of
workin' on,

17:03.000 --> 17:05.030
but everything else sounds amazing.

17:05.030 --> 17:06.083
You know what? Thank you.

17:06.084 --> 17:08.056
I mean, really.

17:08.056 --> 17:11.008
It's at times like this
you know who your pals are, innit?

17:11.008 --> 17:12.076
I'm flabbergasted.

17:12.076 --> 17:14.056
I'm blown away.

17:16.044 --> 17:18.021
Here, you couldnae rustle us up
a honeymoon

17:18.021 --> 17:19.050
while you're at it, could you?

17:20.076 --> 17:22.058
It's no' boxer shorts you're
needing,

17:22.058 --> 17:25.038
it's a bin liner for the baws on
you. Honeymoon, by Christ.

17:25.038 --> 17:28.041
Where would you care to go? Name
your destination. The Seychelles?!

17:28.044 --> 17:29.064
The Orient Express?

17:29.064 --> 17:31.050
India?
Aye.

17:31.050 --> 17:34.022
I'm sorry, you're right enough.
I-I don't know what I was thinking.

17:34.022 --> 17:36.035
No, I'm saying,
would you like to go to India?

17:36.036 --> 17:38.011
Because I can sort that.

17:44.092 --> 17:46.086
MAN: Hello?

17:46.086 --> 17:50.076
DEEP VOICE:Hello, I'm wanting
to speak to Midge Ure.

17:50.076 --> 17:52.038
This is he.

17:52.038 --> 17:55.070
No way! Midge! How are you?

17:55.070 --> 17:57.058
I've no' seen you for years.

17:57.058 --> 17:59.030
What you up to, you devil?

17:59.030 --> 18:00.096
You mad party animal!

18:00.096 --> 18:04.058
Larging it like the old days,
Midgemaster?

18:04.058 --> 18:05.070
BUZZING

18:05.070 --> 18:11.022
What's all the noise?
Are you...laying doon a track?

18:12.056 --> 18:13.070
Hold on.

18:13.070 --> 18:15.070
HOOVER STOPS

18:15.070 --> 18:17.070
Who is this?

18:17.070 --> 18:19.030
Boabby.

18:19.030 --> 18:20.096
Boabby?
Aye.

18:20.096 --> 18:22.078
Fae back in the day at the QM.

18:22.078 --> 18:24.096
Boabby the bouncer.

18:24.096 --> 18:27.064
I was wondering
if you could do an auld pal a favour

18:27.064 --> 18:31.044
and play a gig for a dear old friend
of mine called Winston.

18:31.044 --> 18:33.010
It's his wedding.

18:33.010 --> 18:34.083
I don't know any Winstons.

18:34.084 --> 18:37.030
And come to think of it,
I don't know any Boabbys.

18:37.030 --> 18:39.042
How did you get my number?

18:39.044 --> 18:42.010
Well, you gave it to me.
When?

18:42.010 --> 18:43.056
37 year ago.

18:45.067 --> 18:47.058
Boabby!

18:47.058 --> 18:51.008
Christ, how are you doing?
Great to hear from you!

18:51.008 --> 18:53.048
No problem. I'm in.

18:53.048 --> 18:54.070
Really?

18:54.070 --> 18:56.007
No! Get yourself to fu...

18:59.016 --> 19:01.056
You'd dae that for me?

19:01.056 --> 19:03.076
Well, everybody else
seems to be doing something.

19:03.076 --> 19:04.086
I was feeling left out.

19:04.086 --> 19:07.090
We're not going to India this year,
so you may as well use them.

19:07.092 --> 19:10.000
But are air miles no' worth a
fortune?

19:10.000 --> 19:11.044
They're free.

19:11.044 --> 19:14.010
And if they're not used soon,
they go out of date.

19:14.010 --> 19:15.096
LAUGHS

19:15.096 --> 19:17.036
What are you laughing at?

19:17.036 --> 19:19.079
You being concerned about things
being out of date.

19:21.022 --> 19:23.038
What aboot digs?

19:23.038 --> 19:24.063
Meena?

19:24.064 --> 19:27.010
Can the two of them
stay with your brother in Jaipur?

19:27.010 --> 19:29.096
TRANSLATED:

19:34.064 --> 19:36.028
Meena says go with her blessing.

19:40.008 --> 19:41.092
DOOR BEEPS

19:41.092 --> 19:44.076
Meena, put the box down.

19:44.076 --> 19:47.044
Mwah!

19:47.044 --> 19:49.008
CLEARS THROAT

19:51.028 --> 19:54.028
This isnae what it looks like.
I was thanking her.

19:54.028 --> 19:56.019
Thanking her for what?

19:56.019 --> 19:58.078
For our wedding gift.

19:58.078 --> 20:01.010
We're going to India!

20:03.076 --> 20:05.010
Winnie!

20:05.010 --> 20:06.035
MEENA:Oh...

20:10.008 --> 20:11.067
Well...

20:13.030 --> 20:14.038
Isa.

20:14.038 --> 20:15.042
Hello, Tam.

20:15.044 --> 20:18.010
Listen, I'm awful busy
with the cakes and that.

20:18.010 --> 20:21.076
I know, but I cannae arrange
flowers, Isa.

20:21.076 --> 20:23.048
It needs a woman's touch.

20:23.048 --> 20:25.036
Can Frances no' help ye?

20:25.036 --> 20:27.036
Naw. She's raging at me.

20:27.036 --> 20:29.036
How?

20:37.096 --> 20:40.092
I got them out a skip
at the back of the crematorium.

20:40.092 --> 20:42.050
I think they look lovely.

20:42.050 --> 20:44.035
Get me a bin liner.

20:44.036 --> 20:47.008
What, and throw them all oot?

20:47.008 --> 20:48.010
Yes.

20:48.010 --> 20:49.042
Starting wi' that!

20:54.022 --> 20:55.035
Oh, come on.

20:55.036 --> 20:56.092
It's gonnae be brilliant.

20:56.092 --> 20:58.064
People's Palace.

20:58.064 --> 21:00.076
We're going to be indoors, eh?

21:00.076 --> 21:02.030
Nae chance of rain.

21:02.030 --> 21:05.019
I don't mind rain at a wedding.
I heard it's good luck.

21:05.019 --> 21:09.058
Winnie, when I promised you
the greatest day of your life

21:09.058 --> 21:13.078
wi' a honeymoon and all that,
I had nothin' to back that up.

21:13.078 --> 21:16.096
See, years ago,
when I worked in the shipyards,

21:16.096 --> 21:20.070
I was doing OK, but, well,
then they shut all that doon,

21:20.070 --> 21:25.019
and I've been living a hand-to-mouth
existence ever since.

21:25.019 --> 21:29.064
And then I meet you,
I want to gie you everything...

21:30.086 --> 21:31.090
I cannae.

21:31.092 --> 21:35.044
Oh, you have so much to offer,
Winston.

21:35.044 --> 21:38.000
You make me laugh.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.092
And you don't need to provide all
that for us.

21:40.092 --> 21:42.000
But I havnae, Winnie.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.056
My pals have done it all, see?

21:43.056 --> 21:50.010
Well, it looks as if your pals love
you as much as I do.

21:53.022 --> 21:56.047
MUSIC AND HUBBUB

21:56.048 --> 21:58.067
Watch it wi' the elbows, mate.

21:58.067 --> 22:00.044
Sorry, pal. This is my spot.

22:00.044 --> 22:01.084
What you talking aboot?

22:02.086 --> 22:04.030
I've met her 17 times.

22:04.030 --> 22:06.015
I know her.

22:06.016 --> 22:07.028
Aye, so ye dae.

22:07.028 --> 22:09.084
Aye, well, she'll be oot in a
minute,

22:09.084 --> 22:11.056
