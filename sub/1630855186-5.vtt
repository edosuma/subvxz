00:02.079 --> 00:06.119
I'll ask again!
What were you doing at Dr. Urdea's?

00:06.280 --> 00:09.599
I wasn't feeling well.
I asked my friend to come with me.

00:09.760 --> 00:13.880
What was your father's message
about you leaving the country?

00:14.040 --> 00:17.159
There was no message, I swear!

00:23.079 --> 00:27.440
Then why did you have all that
foreign currency in your room?

00:29.000 --> 00:34.360
Chickie, lying to the Secret Police
is punishable by law.

00:34.520 --> 00:36.800
I didn't know Dad put it there.

00:36.960 --> 00:41.400
Lies! Urdea was supposed to deliver
you to the Americans at the border.

00:41.559 --> 00:45.480
-Where?
-I wish my dad had thought of that.

00:46.599 --> 00:51.079
But there was no plan.
I didn't know he meant to defect!

00:52.800 --> 00:54.400
Really?

00:56.440 --> 00:59.360
So daddy dear left you on your own?

00:59.520 --> 01:01.720
Is that what you're saying?

01:05.480 --> 01:08.599
How could he, if he adored you?

01:08.760 --> 01:13.480
There's no way.
You know how I know that?

01:15.840 --> 01:17.320
Look.

01:18.760 --> 01:21.480
Because Felix told me everything.

01:21.639 --> 01:24.199
As you are going to do also.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.679
She must have seen
or heard something!

01:30.840 --> 01:32.880
We must get it out of her!

01:33.040 --> 01:35.400
I bet she's as unstable
as her mother.

01:37.159 --> 01:40.160
She's just a child, Elena.

01:42.440 --> 01:44.040
She's just a child!

01:44.200 --> 01:46.600
A traitor's child!

01:50.760 --> 01:54.720
I'd give anything
to make sure Victor is suffering,

01:54.880 --> 01:58.520
but I can't go that far with Ileana!

01:58.680 --> 02:03.360
If those Free Europe bastards
find out, they'll tell the world

02:03.520 --> 02:06.920
that I'm a monster
torturing innocent children.

02:07.080 --> 02:11.520
She's not innocent!
No one who served Victor is!

02:11.680 --> 02:16.440
We have to let Victor know
his daughter is suffering.

03:52.760 --> 03:59.120
Our sources in Bucharest say the
Securitate took her for questioning.

03:59.280 --> 04:00.600
They're doing it to get to me.

04:00.760 --> 04:03.680
I am sure they will let her out soon.

04:03.840 --> 04:06.760
What do you mean?
How long has she been there?

04:06.920 --> 04:09.400
-All night.
-What?

04:09.560 --> 04:12.400
Get me Frank. I want to talk to him.

04:12.560 --> 04:15.480
Frank is no longer on your case.

04:16.560 --> 04:19.480
Then get me whoever is in charge!

04:19.640 --> 04:24.760
-I want to make a deal. Now!
-Yes, sir.

04:56.400 --> 04:59.520
This number is not allocated.

05:00.840 --> 05:02.680
Shit.

05:12.560 --> 05:14.800
This number is not allocated.

05:14.960 --> 05:16.640
Shit!

05:19.560 --> 05:21.600
You want to talk?

05:21.760 --> 05:25.840
I have crucial information that could
threaten the Camp David peace talks.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.200
-Like what?
-Like an attack.

05:29.360 --> 05:31.360
An attack?

05:31.520 --> 05:34.480
You gonna have to give me more
if you want me to believe you.

05:34.640 --> 05:36.560
Not before your president promises me

05:36.720 --> 05:40.800
that I'll be on a plane to Washington
within 24 hours.

05:40.960 --> 05:45.640
He'll get my daughter to the States
by Christmas. This Christmas.

05:45.800 --> 05:50.600
I'm afraid you're not exactly
in a position to set conditions here.

05:51.600 --> 05:55.440
Just send a message to Riley.
He'll know what to do with it.

05:58.320 --> 06:01.080
See, now you are hurting my feelings.

06:04.560 --> 06:10.280
You know, everyone at Langley,
including George,

06:11.600 --> 06:14.480
is questioning your credibility.

06:14.640 --> 06:18.040
So if I'm gonna be
your little messenger...

06:20.680 --> 06:23.800
You're gonna have to make me believe
it's for real.

06:31.360 --> 06:33.160
Walter.

06:35.280 --> 06:37.760
You have a nice life here.

06:37.920 --> 06:39.440
But that will be taken from you

06:39.600 --> 06:42.440
when the Camp David peace talks fail
on your watch

06:42.600 --> 06:44.760
'cause you tried playing hardball
with a Commie

06:44.920 --> 06:49.280
instead of following up on intel
about a deadly attack.

06:49.440 --> 06:51.480
See, Anita is here already.

06:51.640 --> 06:55.520
You'll love the school trip.
I promise.

06:55.680 --> 06:58.720
You might even make campfire bread!

06:58.880 --> 07:00.200
-Hi, Anita.
-Hello.

07:00.360 --> 07:02.000
Hi, you three.

07:04.240 --> 07:08.200
Be good, all right? But not too good.

07:08.360 --> 07:11.000
Listen to the counselors.

07:11.160 --> 07:13.640
Mom loves you so much.

07:15.240 --> 07:18.960
Enjoy the trip, my little angel.

07:23.360 --> 07:25.320
Okay, in you go.

07:25.480 --> 07:27.360
Is there still room?

07:33.960 --> 07:36.160
Bye, enjoy.

07:42.080 --> 07:43.560
Max!

08:00.320 --> 08:01.640
I'm a pain in the ass,

08:01.800 --> 08:03.920
I'm off the case,
but when you need me I'm back on ?

08:04.080 --> 08:06.800
Well, you did say he was your guy,
so it's still your mess.

08:06.960 --> 08:10.680
Just, you know, go around and
make him tell you what he knows.

08:10.840 --> 08:13.640
-No.
-Give us a reason to believe.

08:13.800 --> 08:16.080
-Can you afford not to?
-Victor.

08:16.240 --> 08:19.080
Withholding crucial information
from us might make Langley wonder

08:19.240 --> 08:21.520
if we're in the same boat. Are we?

08:23.160 --> 08:26.520
Funny, I've started to ask myself
the same question.

08:26.680 --> 08:29.200
Keeping me here doesn't quite give me
the confidence

08:29.360 --> 08:31.640
in the CIA's intentions.

08:31.800 --> 08:34.240
-You lied.
-So did you.

08:34.400 --> 08:36.920
Yet here I am
putting something on the table.

08:37.080 --> 08:40.680
Take it or not, check it or not,
it's your choice.

08:40.840 --> 08:42.360
You want a deal?

08:42.520 --> 08:44.720
You want a Christmas turkey
in the free world

08:44.880 --> 08:46.720
with your beloved daughter?

08:46.880 --> 08:48.200
Then you have got to convince us

08:48.360 --> 08:51.680
that you're not playing games,
General Godeanu.

08:55.240 --> 08:57.560
There's an Arab faction in Bonn

08:57.720 --> 09:00.640
ready to blow up
your president's peace talks.

09:03.280 --> 09:06.880
-Do you have a name and a place?
-Just a name.

09:08.600 --> 09:10.600
Ceaușescu has them guarded
like Fort Knox.

09:10.760 --> 09:12.960
How the hell does he think
we're gonna get his family out?

09:13.120 --> 09:15.480
Not his family, just his daughter.

09:15.640 --> 09:19.320
Those Commies are
cold-hearted bastards.

09:19.480 --> 09:21.480
-What if he's bluffing?
-Who knows.

09:21.640 --> 09:24.160
If there's a grain of truth to it,
we've got to take it seriously.

09:24.320 --> 09:25.920
But why is he coming out with it now?

09:26.080 --> 09:28.160
His daughter's been taken,
he's stuck here.

09:28.320 --> 09:30.880
If he's saved this intel
for a rainy day,

09:31.040 --> 09:32.560
it doesn't get rainier than this.

09:32.720 --> 09:35.640
Okay. You call George,
I'll call the Germans.

09:35.800 --> 09:40.040
-Why me? I'm persona non grata.
-That's precisely why.

09:40.200 --> 09:42.160
He already hates you.

09:46.040 --> 09:48.320
Why the hell didn't you guys know
about this earlier?

09:48.480 --> 09:51.960
It takes a defector to tell you
what's going on on your own backyard?

09:52.120 --> 09:55.000
Did any of us know the Egyptians
could just kick out the Soviets?

09:55.160 --> 09:58.600
-That is not the point.
-It's precisely the point!

09:58.760 --> 10:01.720
And if it makes you feel any better,
it seems the Germans had no clue.

10:01.880 --> 10:03.480
But, you know, I get it.

10:03.640 --> 10:05.560
You want me to be a piñata?
Fine. Go ahead.

10:05.720 --> 10:07.520
We got all the fucking time
in the world.

10:07.680 --> 10:11.080
Frank, this is going to rattle
the president.

10:11.240 --> 10:13.040
We need to be sure.

10:13.200 --> 10:16.320
I mean, do you really buy
what Godeanu was saying?

10:16.480 --> 10:18.440
I don't think we can afford
to debate this anymore.

10:18.600 --> 10:22.320
I doubt Godeanu is just casually
gambling with his...

10:22.480 --> 10:26.200
With his own future.
And his daughter's.

10:26.360 --> 10:29.760
Okay. Do it.
I'll get Carter on board.

10:47.120 --> 10:52.400
The world looks different from
behind a window, don't you think?

10:52.560 --> 10:54.800
I suppose so.

10:56.400 --> 10:59.920
Hey, look. You made the front page.

11:01.040 --> 11:03.160
Nice car.

11:03.320 --> 11:04.840
WHO IS ROMANIAN DEFECTOR
VICTOR GODEANU?

11:09.520 --> 11:13.400
I'm sure that,
once we get through this chaos,

11:13.560 --> 11:15.840
your family will join you.

11:17.120 --> 11:19.760
I'm not sure of anything anymore.

11:21.320 --> 11:25.320
John, can I trust you?

11:25.480 --> 11:27.840
Can you do me a favor?

11:28.000 --> 11:31.320
There's a conference at the Embassy
on Saturday.

11:31.480 --> 11:33.440
We'll use this to get inside
and take Godeanu.

11:33.600 --> 11:36.200
I know where to take him.

11:36.360 --> 11:39.760
-Do they have IDs for the conference?
-Yes.

11:39.920 --> 11:41.680
Good.

11:41.840 --> 11:44.200
I want to be a hundred percent
certain that what I see here

11:44.360 --> 11:46.560
is exactly how it is
out in the field.

11:46.720 --> 11:50.920
I want to know if this corner
is as protected as it looks.

11:51.080 --> 11:55.680
That no military police or marines
are wandering around.

11:55.840 --> 11:57.640
We have the schedule of the marines

11:57.800 --> 11:59.880
and guards on three floors,
including Victor's.

12:00.040 --> 12:04.520
Lunch time, habits,
how often they change.

12:04.680 --> 12:06.400
We've got the official timetables.

12:06.560 --> 12:09.880
-Now all we need to do is confirm it.
-Good.

12:10.040 --> 12:12.200
And keep your ear on that microphone.

12:12.360 --> 12:15.240
Maybe we get valuable intel
straight from CIA.

12:15.400 --> 12:16.720
Yes.

12:17.840 --> 12:20.320
This can't fail.

12:25.320 --> 12:28.320
I will find a way
to get you out of that hell.

12:28.480 --> 12:31.120
In a few months you'll be with me.

12:31.280 --> 12:33.000
In America.

12:45.200 --> 12:47.480
Nice car.

12:47.640 --> 12:51.600
-We have a deal. Give me the name.
-You have Carter's promise?

12:51.760 --> 12:55.240
George's, but he'll convince Carter.

12:55.400 --> 12:57.760
-Are you sure?
-No.

12:57.920 --> 13:00.320
But neither of us has
a better option.

13:05.080 --> 13:09.320
-Promise me.
-I promise.

13:18.800 --> 13:20.760
Omar Fahim.

13:27.200 --> 13:28.920
Hello?

13:29.080 --> 13:32.440
Sorry, Safiya.
I can't talk, I need to go.

13:33.960 --> 13:36.040
Okay. No problem, Mrs. Ingrid.

13:36.200 --> 13:39.960
Gustav's mother is ill
and Gustav is on a business trip,

13:40.120 --> 13:42.240
so I have to check on her.

13:42.400 --> 13:44.080
I'm sorry to hear that.

13:44.240 --> 13:49.240
No, I'm sorry.
I know you're having a hard time.

13:51.160 --> 13:52.480
Is everything all right?

13:54.080 --> 13:58.080
Omar and Jabare left
without saying anything.

13:58.240 --> 14:00.040
I think...

14:01.080 --> 14:04.000
I believe maybe I overreacted.

14:05.000 --> 14:08.400
No, you didn't. Listen.

14:08.560 --> 14:13.040
Take your son and get as far
as possible from the two of them.

14:14.480 --> 14:17.320
I need to hang up.
Don't forget what I said.

14:17.480 --> 14:21.280
My son is in school.
I don't know how to...

14:21.440 --> 14:23.320
Listen to me.

14:25.440 --> 14:27.880
Do exactly as I tell you.

14:28.800 --> 14:30.960
Get Achmed from school.

14:31.120 --> 14:34.920
Pack a bag, only what you can carry.
Then leave.

14:37.880 --> 14:40.040
Blend into the crowd.

14:40.200 --> 14:42.800
If you feel followed,
hide in a store.

14:42.960 --> 14:46.600
Then go on. As far as you can.

14:46.760 --> 14:48.840
I hope to see you again
when I'm back.

15:53.960 --> 15:56.560
How are you? Did they hurt you?

15:56.720 --> 15:59.120
-How could Dad do this?
-Look at me.

15:59.280 --> 16:01.320
He knew what would happen to us.

16:01.480 --> 16:05.200
I'll find a way. I promise.

16:08.160 --> 16:10.400
-It will be fine.
-How?

16:10.560 --> 16:13.440
Can't you see we're prisoners here?

16:13.600 --> 16:16.200
I'm going upstairs. Leave me alone!

17:33.000 --> 17:35.760
He's okayed it.
But only because he's petrified

17:35.920 --> 17:37.720
the smallest things will sink
the peace talks.

17:37.880 --> 17:41.480
-We all are.
-There's not a lot to go on.

17:42.600 --> 17:43.960
Bonn's a small city.

17:44.120 --> 17:47.040
Frank's alerted the Germans, the
troops are searching every corner.

17:47.200 --> 17:49.760
And he's questioning
Godeanu's morals.

17:49.920 --> 17:52.040
Didn't like that he bargained
into this kind of intel.

17:52.200 --> 17:55.000
Politics is all about bargaining.
And come on...

17:55.160 --> 17:59.960
He wants his daughter out
and we want Camp David safe.

18:00.120 --> 18:02.120
It's a win-win.

18:47.720 --> 18:53.040
The flat's been raided.
Assume I'm being followed.

19:24.160 --> 19:25.760
I've met Omar.

19:25.920 --> 19:29.160
He was in one of our training camps
a few years ago.

19:30.680 --> 19:32.680
He went by the name of Ishmael.

19:34.840 --> 19:37.960
The German police lost him, but they
gave us what they had on them.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.240
You know her?

19:44.120 --> 19:45.920
We know she's Ingrid's housekeeper.

19:47.160 --> 19:50.240
Is Safiya involved in the attack?

19:50.400 --> 19:54.680
If she is, then your Ingrid
might know about it too, right?

19:54.840 --> 19:57.640
And if Ingrid knows, the big
question is: Is Stasi behind it?

19:57.800 --> 19:59.600
-Or just her.
-It makes no sense.

19:59.760 --> 20:03.080
Ingrid has nothing to do with it.

20:03.240 --> 20:06.880
-How can you be so sure?
-I know her.

20:07.040 --> 20:08.800
Very well.

20:11.200 --> 20:14.400
I guess whoever gave you Omar
wanted this to blow back on her.

21:26.480 --> 21:28.920
How bad is it?

21:29.080 --> 21:31.840
Is Godeanu talking?

21:32.000 --> 21:34.440
Not yet, as far as we know.

21:34.600 --> 21:37.160
Any news from our Russian friend?

21:39.600 --> 21:43.960
No. We're still on schedule.

21:44.120 --> 21:46.080
It has to be tomorrow.

21:46.240 --> 21:48.520
The police got a tip.

21:48.680 --> 21:51.600
They have a name,
but they're sitting on it.

21:51.760 --> 21:54.920
We've done our bit,
they've got the guns.

21:55.080 --> 21:56.880
Let's see how it plays out.

21:58.800 --> 22:02.640
And Mrs. Von Weizendorff?
Anything new?

22:02.800 --> 22:07.040
The BND know she's Stasi,
but we're still in the clear.

22:09.280 --> 22:10.960
I think she's on the run.

22:16.320 --> 22:20.080
Just as well. She'll make
a good scapegoat if needed.

22:21.200 --> 22:22.680
Right.

22:22.840 --> 22:25.440
I saw the file she has on me,
it's clean.

22:25.600 --> 22:27.640
She doesn't know anything.

22:29.840 --> 22:32.480
So, officially, she's on the run,

22:32.640 --> 22:36.600
or crazy, or both.

23:38.160 --> 23:40.920
Yeah, you got some technique.

23:41.080 --> 23:44.560
They call that one
putting the hand in the cookie jar.

23:51.120 --> 23:55.000
You must have given them
something pretty juicy back there.

23:56.120 --> 23:59.760
You're gonna want to be in Washington
when I give up all I know.

24:01.560 --> 24:04.360
Oh, yeah? Like what?

24:05.400 --> 24:08.800
Like how much technology
we have stolen from the West.

24:08.960 --> 24:12.440
And what we and the Soviets plan
to do with it.

24:21.280 --> 24:26.040
-Are they beefing up security?
-It's for a conference tomorrow.

24:27.560 --> 24:30.360
-So it's not all about me, then.
-Oh, no.

24:30.520 --> 24:32.560
They're still keeping you
under wraps.

24:32.720 --> 24:35.560
Half the staff don't even
know your situation.

24:35.720 --> 24:41.760
-So, who do they think I am?
-Frank's Romanian basketball buddy?

24:41.920 --> 24:44.600
What's so special
about this conference?

24:44.760 --> 24:47.640
Just that a lot of important people
are coming.

24:47.800 --> 24:51.520
Including Sasha Kenvin, you know,
the Israeli basketball player.

24:51.680 --> 24:53.120
I hope to get his autograph.

25:25.040 --> 25:27.600
Once they have been ID'd as waiters,
they have access anywhere.

25:27.760 --> 25:30.160
As long as they are carrying a tray,
they belong there.

25:30.320 --> 25:32.720
I'm just gonna take one of these.

25:42.200 --> 25:45.760
This gives us access to corridors
to the administrative wing.

25:45.920 --> 25:49.920
Including Frank Jackson's floor,
where is his office.

25:51.240 --> 25:53.720
We are planning to get the movements
of the officers who can enter

25:53.880 --> 25:56.840
the wing where Godeanu is being kept.

25:57.000 --> 26:03.480
We're checking all corridors,
all exits, all stairs, everything.

26:03.640 --> 26:05.960
There are two
lifts before reaching Godeanu.

26:06.120 --> 26:08.480
We want to check if Simpson
and Jackson are using

26:08.640 --> 26:10.600
the one closer to their wing.

26:12.080 --> 26:14.720
Once we know the walking patterns
of Godeanu's visitors,

26:14.880 --> 26:19.400
we can plan the escape route
with the least risk of exposure.

26:21.160 --> 26:23.360
We have an idea
where Godeanu's room is.

26:23.520 --> 26:25.440
Let's see
how easy it is to get there.

26:25.600 --> 26:28.160
Agent Poenaru will check
the entire east wing,

26:28.320 --> 26:31.120
until he finds Victor's room.

26:33.520 --> 26:37.040
-What about the gun?
-He'll have it, he'll hide it today.

26:37.200 --> 26:40.280
But the plan is just to scoop him.

26:49.320 --> 26:51.120
Give me one of those.

26:59.880 --> 27:02.280
The president said yes.

27:17.080 --> 27:20.720
-Omar can't be working alone.
-I agree.

27:23.440 --> 27:26.560
We trained Arab soldiers, you know.

27:26.720 --> 27:31.280
I might be able to help.
Narrow it down at least for you.

27:34.240 --> 27:36.480
Don't shut me out.

27:36.640 --> 27:40.080
I know what's at stake
and you know I can help.

27:46.920 --> 27:49.120
Okay.

27:49.280 --> 27:51.120
There is something
I'd like you to do for me.

27:53.200 --> 27:55.360
I thought there might be.

27:58.160 --> 28:02.040
John was kind enough to let me record
this message for my daughter.

28:02.200 --> 28:04.360
Can you get it to Ileana?

28:08.920 --> 28:11.720
Get it to her in Romania?

28:11.880 --> 28:13.840
I trust you'll find a way.

28:14.000 --> 28:17.640
I'll find a way
to get you out of that hell.

28:17.800 --> 28:20.480
In a few months you'll be with me.

28:20.640 --> 28:22.840
In America.

28:23.000 --> 28:25.640
You promised him that we'd get
this tape to his daughter?

28:25.800 --> 28:28.200
'Cause that's not an easy gig,
you know that.

28:28.360 --> 28:30.560
I didn't promise anything.

28:30.720 --> 28:33.680
I just wanted him
to get it out of his system.

28:33.840 --> 28:37.120
And what's the word
from our Romanian friends are?

28:37.280 --> 28:40.200
She's under 24-hour surveillance.

28:40.360 --> 28:42.600
We can't actually get her this tape.

28:42.760 --> 28:44.560
Most likely not.

28:46.920 --> 28:49.080
What are we gonna tell him?

28:52.920 --> 28:54.640
Nothing.

29:19.320 --> 29:21.560
They interrogated her all night long.

29:21.720 --> 29:24.360
She can take it. She's a strong girl.

29:24.520 --> 29:26.360
What the hell happened, Boris?

29:26.520 --> 29:28.840
Victor went to the CIA?
It makes no sense.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.400
That wasn't the plan,
but don't worry, we are...

29:31.560 --> 29:33.360
It's not for him I'm worrying.

29:36.120 --> 29:39.000
I'm worrying for my child.

29:41.960 --> 29:43.320
Who will look after her?

30:34.440 --> 30:40.160
The night you and I broke up,
I took a taxi home.

30:42.120 --> 30:44.240
When we arrived, I asked the driver

30:44.400 --> 30:47.640
to let me stay in the car
for a minute.

30:49.880 --> 30:53.240
Our song, "Temptation,"
was playing on the radio.

30:59.480 --> 31:02.080
I felt it was a sign.

31:02.240 --> 31:06.200
Just the sign I needed
to make up my mind.

31:08.680 --> 31:12.360
I asked the driver
to take me back there.

31:14.840 --> 31:20.000
By the time we got back,
you had already left.

31:25.320 --> 31:28.560
I always wondered
how my life would have been

31:28.720 --> 31:31.600
if I had found you there.

31:38.320 --> 31:41.200
Boris, we made a promise
to each other.

31:43.200 --> 31:46.600
I kept my word and gave you Victor.

31:53.000 --> 31:54.960
It's your turn now.

31:57.320 --> 32:02.400
Only you can save my child. Please!

32:03.440 --> 32:05.480
How could I refuse you?

32:09.200 --> 32:11.440
But you will have to help me.

32:13.200 --> 32:15.720
I almost feel sorry for them.

32:15.880 --> 32:20.680
Really? What for? Look at this villa.

32:21.640 --> 32:24.040
I feel more sorry for myself.

32:26.520 --> 32:29.240
What's she doing?

32:29.400 --> 32:33.200
-Has she lost it?
-What? That's Godeanu's clothes.

32:33.360 --> 32:35.280
What the hell?

32:44.920 --> 32:47.920
-Is that petrol?
-What the hell is this?

32:52.080 --> 32:53.880
No, stop!

32:54.040 --> 32:56.160
Comrade Godeanu, don't!

32:57.520 --> 33:00.560
What the... Comrade Godeanu, please!

33:01.560 --> 33:03.520
What the...?

33:04.440 --> 33:07.400
Comrade Godeanu, please,
there's really no need--

33:07.560 --> 33:09.200
No, Comrade Godeanu.

33:09.360 --> 33:12.840
-Don't set fire to things, please.
-Shove off!

33:13.000 --> 33:16.240
Get her daughter. She's lost it!
Comrade Godeanu, please!

33:25.400 --> 33:27.800
Miss Godeanu!

33:27.960 --> 33:29.840
Where are you?

33:30.920 --> 33:32.560
Please.

33:36.280 --> 33:39.320
-I can't find her.
-Try in the back! Go!

33:46.240 --> 33:49.160
One-one-five here.
Adela Godeanu's gone nuts.

33:49.320 --> 33:53.360
We can't find her daughter
to calm her down. Send someone.

34:00.240 --> 34:03.680
-Did you get the tape to her?
-We're working on it.

34:03.840 --> 34:07.080
-Is she okay?
-We think so.

34:08.720 --> 34:12.360
BND just brought these
out of Omar's apartment.

34:19.000 --> 34:20.880
Jabare Hassan.

34:21.040 --> 34:23.320
You know the guy?

34:23.480 --> 34:26.240
First met him in Egypt.

34:26.400 --> 34:30.040
He came to Bucharest first
as a courier, then to train.

34:30.200 --> 34:32.360
What's his deal?

34:32.520 --> 34:35.680
He was a teacher, studied law,
very smart.

34:35.840 --> 34:39.800
Radicalized in 1971.
He's an efficient bomb maker.

34:39.960 --> 34:43.600
-You think he's working with Omar?
-I think he's the mastermind.

34:44.800 --> 34:46.800
We need to find him.

34:46.960 --> 34:50.840
CAMP DAVID RADIO REPORT DEAL
BETWEN EGYPT AND ISRAEL

34:51.000 --> 34:54.000
We have just been told
the peace talks at Camp David

34:54.160 --> 34:57.720
mediated by President Carter,
cleared a big hurdle.

34:57.880 --> 35:01.800
Egyptian President Sadat considered
leaving the talks altogether.

35:01.960 --> 35:06.720
His change of heartis
a clear sign of renewed hope.

35:11.440 --> 35:14.520
Sir? There's a phone call for you.
Thank you.

35:18.640 --> 35:20.120
-Yes?
- It's time.

35:20.280 --> 35:22.880
We do it tomorrow,
before it's too late.

35:23.040 --> 35:26.160
The peace talks cleared a big hurdle

35:26.320 --> 35:32.320
and a deal between Egypt and Israel
is closer than ever.

35:32.480 --> 35:35.240
Once you've extracted him,
take him to the secure site

35:35.400 --> 35:39.320
-and deal with him there.
-I'll deal with him myself.

35:39.480 --> 35:43.680
-You want to be there when--
-I will be, at the end.

35:43.840 --> 35:45.920
To get your report fresh.

37:48.280 --> 37:50.120
How the hell could she disappear?

37:52.040 --> 37:54.720
Comrade Nicolae Ceaușescu,
I am here to report.

37:54.880 --> 37:57.040
We are interrogating everyone.

37:57.200 --> 37:59.840
I solemnly promise
we will find the culprit.

38:00.000 --> 38:02.120
She can't have vanished!

38:02.280 --> 38:05.080
How the hell did no one see her?

38:09.280 --> 38:13.240
Are you all a bunch of idiots?

38:13.400 --> 38:17.400
Arrest them all!
Make the borders airtight!

38:17.560 --> 38:23.200
No train, no car, no plane leaves
without being checked through!

38:23.360 --> 38:25.120
Out!

39:12.200 --> 39:15.200
Check this one.

39:16.800 --> 39:18.600
All clear.

39:19.720 --> 39:23.160
...against the principles of 242,
but all in all,

39:23.320 --> 39:26.680
the Camp David peace talks seem
to be hurtling towards a success.

41:46.640 --> 41:50.400
Excuse me. My car won't start.

41:50.560 --> 41:53.800
But I need to cross.
It's an urgent family matter.

41:53.960 --> 41:55.880
Your passport, please.

42:09.560 --> 42:11.880
Your passport is expired.

42:12.880 --> 42:15.600
That can't be.
Can you please check again?

42:15.760 --> 42:18.760
I'm sorry, I can't let you through.

42:26.640 --> 42:28.040
Stop her!

42:29.400 --> 42:31.800
Put your guns down!

42:35.760 --> 42:37.360
Freeze!

42:39.640 --> 42:41.840
It's all right. I'm unarmed!

42:43.400 --> 42:45.960
Tell your West German friends
to put their guns down!

42:46.120 --> 42:49.120
I have family in East Germany!

42:52.400 --> 42:56.400
