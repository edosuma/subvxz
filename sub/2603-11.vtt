WEBVTT

00:10.167 --> 00:13.510
Are you watching me?

00:13.511 --> 00:14.878
Do I look dashing?

00:14.912 --> 00:16.742
Nobody says dashing.

00:16.777 --> 00:18.311
James Bond says dashing.

00:18.345 --> 00:19.512
You think you're James Bond?

00:19.547 --> 00:21.620
I could be James Bond.

00:21.654 --> 00:23.658
I've got Connery's swagger...

00:23.693 --> 00:27.303
Definitely
Daniel Craig's physique...

00:27.337 --> 00:29.672
Lazenby's...

00:29.706 --> 00:33.476
I have no idea
what he's known for.

00:33.513 --> 00:36.151
You okay?

00:36.185 --> 00:38.353
I had an interesting
conversation

00:38.387 --> 00:41.523
with Louis last night.

00:41.558 --> 00:44.694
He said I should be careful
of you and Rachel.

00:44.728 --> 00:46.496
Do I have anything
to worry about?

00:46.531 --> 00:47.631
No.

00:47.665 --> 00:49.065
He hates me,

00:49.099 --> 00:52.168
and he's just trying
to get to me through you.

00:52.203 --> 00:54.203
So you never--

00:54.237 --> 00:55.371
No.

00:55.405 --> 00:57.339
You got nothing
to worry about.

00:57.373 --> 00:58.640
She's just a friend.

00:58.675 --> 01:02.612
- Okay.
- And I'm late.

01:02.647 --> 01:03.714
I'll call.

01:03.748 --> 01:07.586
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:07.620 --> 01:10.725
We should go out.

01:10.759 --> 01:12.393
Uh, this is going out.

01:12.427 --> 01:16.299
No, I mean you and me
and Rachel

01:16.333 --> 01:17.300
should go on a double date.

01:17.334 --> 01:19.101
Does she have a-a boyfriend?

01:19.136 --> 01:21.370
I, uh, don't know.

01:21.404 --> 01:22.605
No.

01:22.639 --> 01:25.008
Going on a double date
with somebody from work

01:25.043 --> 01:26.376
might be kind of weird.

01:26.411 --> 01:28.346
If I get to know her,
then I won't worry.

01:28.380 --> 01:29.614
It'll be fun.

01:29.648 --> 01:31.282
Just a couple friends
going out.

01:31.317 --> 01:33.485
Right?

01:33.519 --> 01:36.421
Awesome.

02:03.792 --> 02:05.826
Cab?
Someone steal your bike?

02:05.861 --> 02:07.995
I have a lot on my mind.
It's a safety issue.

02:08.030 --> 02:09.163
What are you talking about?

02:09.198 --> 02:10.499
Louis told Jenny
about Rachel and me.

02:10.532 --> 02:12.500
It was one kiss,
and she kissed me.

02:12.535 --> 02:14.636
Okay, Soap Opera,
just give me my documents.

02:14.670 --> 02:17.673
Harvey.

02:17.707 --> 02:19.908
Cameron.

02:19.943 --> 02:21.443
How the hell are you?

02:21.478 --> 02:23.279
- Good to see you.
- Wow.

02:23.313 --> 02:24.680
Too damn long.

02:24.714 --> 02:25.781
Cameron Dennis,
district attorney,

02:25.816 --> 02:27.316
meet Mike Ross,
my associate.

02:27.350 --> 02:29.018
Hi.

02:29.052 --> 02:31.253
I guess that makes you
his Harvey.

02:31.288 --> 02:32.621
- I'm sorry?
- Harvey was my associate.

02:32.655 --> 02:34.556
I taught him everything
he knows.

02:34.591 --> 02:37.826
Best A.D.A. to come up
since me.

02:37.861 --> 02:41.264
- You taught him?
- "Never go to court."

02:41.298 --> 02:42.599
That's me.

02:42.634 --> 02:44.268
"It's not about caring.
It's about winning."

02:44.302 --> 02:45.269
Me.

02:45.304 --> 02:46.804
No way.
Harvey's Harvey.

02:46.838 --> 02:49.307
Yeah, exactly.

02:49.341 --> 02:51.977
We should, uh,
catch up, have lunch.

02:52.012 --> 02:53.646
Hey, you know what?
This is crazy.

02:53.681 --> 02:54.681
I'm free for dinner tonight.

02:54.715 --> 02:56.115
Just cancel whatever you have,

02:56.150 --> 02:59.019
and tell Jessica I demanded
that you clear your schedule.

02:59.053 --> 03:02.356
Dinner it is.
It'd be nice.

03:02.390 --> 03:04.225
That's my boy.

03:04.259 --> 03:06.394
All right, you know where
to find me, 8:00.

03:06.428 --> 03:08.429
Glad I ran into you, Harvey.

03:17.372 --> 03:19.340
Ross, you still work here?

03:19.374 --> 03:20.541
Funny.

03:20.576 --> 03:21.910
Yeah, 'cause I thought
after I beat you--

03:21.944 --> 03:22.911
Yeah, I got it.

03:22.945 --> 03:27.483
- Thanks for expediting.
- Yeah.

03:27.517 --> 03:29.752
Hi.

03:29.786 --> 03:33.723
Hi.

03:33.757 --> 03:35.792
Do you need something?

03:35.826 --> 03:37.827
Did you know that Harvey,
uh, was a prosecutor?

03:37.862 --> 03:39.262
- No, he wasn't.
- Yeah, he was.

03:39.297 --> 03:40.497
I've read every bio
at the firm.

03:40.531 --> 03:41.732
People work
for the D.A.'s office,

03:41.766 --> 03:43.000
it's on their bio.

03:43.034 --> 03:44.602
Well, we ran into
Cameron Dennis this morning.

03:44.636 --> 03:46.103
- The D.A.?
- Yeah.

03:46.137 --> 03:49.006
He says that Harvey's
the best A.D.A. he's ever had.

03:49.041 --> 03:51.542
No. Come here.

03:51.577 --> 03:53.277
See? Nothing about being
a prosecutor.

03:53.312 --> 03:54.379
Yeah.

03:54.413 --> 03:55.713
I need you to go
on a double date

03:55.748 --> 03:57.448
with me and Jenny.

03:57.483 --> 03:58.616
Yeah, not gonna happen.

03:58.650 --> 04:00.918
You have to.
Listen to me.

04:00.953 --> 04:03.088
Louis warned her
about you and me.

04:03.122 --> 04:04.423
Wha--

04:04.457 --> 04:05.491
how did even get--

04:05.525 --> 04:06.792
You know how.

04:06.827 --> 04:08.895
'Cause he walked in
right after you kissed me.

04:08.929 --> 04:10.196
If you say no,
she's gonna think

04:10.231 --> 04:11.798
something's going on
between us.

04:11.833 --> 04:14.535
Okay.
I'll go.

04:14.569 --> 04:17.738
- Thank you.
- Freakin' Louis.

04:17.773 --> 04:20.375
Oh, is this Harvey?

04:20.410 --> 04:22.411
Okay, you are definitely
sending me that photo.

04:22.445 --> 04:24.813
Westlaw lists him
as prosecutor of record

04:24.847 --> 04:27.215
on pages and pages
of cases.

04:27.249 --> 04:28.883
- Told you.
- I don't get it.

04:28.918 --> 04:30.118
Why wouldn't he have this
on his bio?

04:30.152 --> 04:31.386
Because.

04:31.531 --> 04:33.158
Maybe he has something
to hide.

05:08.645 --> 05:11.113
It touches some idealistic
core of your being,

05:11.147 --> 05:14.650
where even the greatest cynic
has not given up hope.

05:14.684 --> 05:15.951
That's why we listen
to music.

05:15.985 --> 05:17.619
Oh, that's beautiful, Louis.

05:17.654 --> 05:18.754
Really.

05:18.788 --> 05:20.555
And I think your decision
to leave law

05:20.590 --> 05:21.623
to become
a music critic

05:21.657 --> 05:23.192
is in everyone's
best interests.

05:23.226 --> 05:24.927
Okay, I was quoting
Peter Sellers.

05:24.961 --> 05:27.996
I just got $1,000-a-head tickets
to <i>Nixon in China.</i>

05:28.030 --> 05:31.399
Are you two dating now?
Should I come back?

05:31.433 --> 05:32.833
Sit down, Harvey.

05:32.868 --> 05:34.335
Love it when you talk to me

05:34.369 --> 05:38.139
like my third grade teacher,
Mrs. Coe.

05:38.174 --> 05:40.241
Gentlemen.

05:40.275 --> 05:42.043
Malcolm Price died last week.

05:42.077 --> 05:43.878
Truly great loss
for humanity.

05:43.912 --> 05:45.713
You want to mock the dead?
Fine.

05:45.747 --> 05:48.382
But his tabloid,
<i>Nothing But the Truth,</i>

05:48.416 --> 05:49.516
has made us a fortune.

05:49.551 --> 05:53.386
Price has left his estate,
ten companies,

05:53.420 --> 05:55.755
including the tabloid,
to his two daughters,

05:55.789 --> 05:57.156
Madison and Kelsey.

05:57.190 --> 05:59.825
We have been asked
to divide the assets up fairly.

05:59.859 --> 06:01.193
And I'm here why?

06:01.227 --> 06:02.394
Because they hate
each other.

06:02.428 --> 06:03.695
Malcolm structured the will

06:03.730 --> 06:04.863
to bring them back together.

06:04.897 --> 06:07.999
You have a knack
for bringing parties together

06:08.033 --> 06:09.701
who don't see eye to eye.

06:09.735 --> 06:10.768
So why is he here?

06:10.803 --> 06:12.537
Because Madison Price
requested him.

06:12.571 --> 06:15.307
You sure she's not mixing him
up with me?

06:15.341 --> 06:16.542
Hardman had me do

06:16.576 --> 06:18.177
some contract work for her
a couple years back,

06:18.211 --> 06:19.611
so I guess I made
an impression.

06:19.646 --> 06:20.746
Right.

06:20.780 --> 06:21.914
So you each get a sister.

06:21.949 --> 06:23.683
You think pitting us
against each other

06:23.718 --> 06:25.752
is fair to Louis' client?

06:25.787 --> 06:27.888
Please.
Dividing financial assets?

06:27.922 --> 06:29.556
- You couldn't shine my shoes.
- Someone should.

06:29.591 --> 06:31.158
Well, actually,
I personally shine my own shoes,

06:31.192 --> 06:32.392
so there you go.

06:32.426 --> 06:34.194
- Oh, lucky them.
- How come you always ask Donna,

06:34.228 --> 06:35.462
"Donna, by the way,

06:35.496 --> 06:37.130
those are really nice shoes
that Louis has on"?

06:37.164 --> 06:38.698
Gentlemen.

06:38.732 --> 06:41.767
We're on the same side.

06:41.802 --> 06:44.403
And although I would not choose
to have you both on this,

06:44.437 --> 06:46.238
that is how it fell.

06:46.272 --> 06:50.709
So I expect you to put
your differences aside

06:50.743 --> 06:53.312
and work together on this

06:53.347 --> 06:55.848
so that everyone
can be happy.

06:55.883 --> 06:58.885
Can you manage that
this time?

07:03.157 --> 07:04.825
She's always hated me.

07:04.860 --> 07:07.061
Maybe this is a chance
to put all that behind you.

07:07.095 --> 07:09.197
I'd like that.
Really, I would.

07:09.231 --> 07:11.400
But Maddie?
I don't think so.

07:11.434 --> 07:12.801
Maybe she'll surprise you.

07:12.836 --> 07:14.536
Kelsey's a bitch.

07:14.570 --> 07:15.904
She doesn't deserve
any of it.

07:15.939 --> 07:18.573
Well, I'm afraid your father
didn't share

07:18.608 --> 07:20.442
that point of view.

07:20.476 --> 07:23.178
According to his will,
we were meant...

07:23.212 --> 07:24.546
To find a division
of these companies

07:24.580 --> 07:25.780
that makes both of you happy.

07:25.815 --> 07:26.781
But I want to make sure...

07:26.816 --> 07:28.250
That you're happy.

07:28.284 --> 07:29.751
You want to know
what will make me happy?

07:29.786 --> 07:31.086
Whatever makes her miserable.

07:31.120 --> 07:32.454
It's simple.

07:32.488 --> 07:34.390
I want <i>Nothing But the Truth.</i>

07:34.424 --> 07:36.992
My father and I worked together
on it for years, and...

07:37.027 --> 07:38.961
It made me crazy.

07:38.996 --> 07:41.831
The two of them pretending
that tabloid was literature.

07:41.865 --> 07:43.499
It means everything to me.

07:43.533 --> 07:44.700
All I want...

07:44.735 --> 07:46.135
Is to sell off
that piece of garbage

07:46.169 --> 07:48.103
and for her to get
as little as possible.

07:48.138 --> 07:49.638
What made her
so mad at you?

07:49.673 --> 07:51.940
She blames me for our dad
leaving her mother

07:51.975 --> 07:53.175
and marrying mine.

07:53.209 --> 07:55.476
How can she think
that's your fault?

07:55.510 --> 07:57.145
Because her mother
got pregnant

07:57.179 --> 07:59.346
and used it to rope in
my dad.

07:59.381 --> 08:02.883
And then little Kelsey became
the center of his universe.

08:02.917 --> 08:05.552
You know what it's like
to have someone hate you

08:05.586 --> 08:06.853
out of pure jealousy?

08:06.887 --> 08:08.188
We'll get you the paper.

08:08.222 --> 08:10.423
Do you know what it's like

08:10.457 --> 08:12.826
to watch someone else
get all the attention

08:12.860 --> 08:16.296
when you know that you're twice
the person they are?

08:16.330 --> 08:19.300
She's not getting that paper.

08:20.702 --> 08:22.236
- Maddie.
- Kelsey.

08:22.271 --> 08:23.738
- Louis.
- Harvey.

08:23.772 --> 08:25.607
Doctor, doctor.

08:25.641 --> 08:27.643
- Chevy.
- Nice.

08:27.677 --> 08:28.777
Good meeting?

08:28.812 --> 08:29.778
Yeah, we connected.
You?

08:29.813 --> 08:31.147
We're on the same page.

08:31.181 --> 08:33.883
Hm. What was, uh,
Kelsey looking for?

08:33.917 --> 08:35.484
I don't know.
Why don't you ask Jenny?

08:35.519 --> 08:38.520
You seem to like talking
to her.

08:42.726 --> 08:45.160
No, Mike,
that's not distracting.

08:45.195 --> 08:46.462
I was just waiting.

08:46.496 --> 08:47.563
For what?

08:47.597 --> 08:51.034
To not be distracting.

08:51.068 --> 08:52.669
How come Harvey doesn't talk
about working

08:52.703 --> 08:55.438
for the D.A.'s office?

08:55.473 --> 08:57.007
- Who told you that?
- Cameron Dennis.

08:57.041 --> 08:58.843
We ran into him
this morning.

08:58.877 --> 09:00.445
They're having dinner.

09:00.479 --> 09:02.180
So that's why he wouldn't tell
me where he was going.

09:02.214 --> 09:04.583
What's going on, Donna?

09:04.617 --> 09:05.617
Let it go.

09:05.652 --> 09:06.952
Don't ask Harvey about this.

09:06.986 --> 09:08.320
What's the big secret?

09:08.355 --> 09:10.923
It's no secret.
Just...

09:10.957 --> 09:13.325
Don't.

09:13.359 --> 09:15.460
And what are we talking about?

09:15.494 --> 09:16.728
The Price sisters.

09:16.762 --> 09:21.165
Those girls.

09:21.199 --> 09:24.034
Mm.

09:24.068 --> 09:25.736
Do we really have to play nice
with Louis?

09:25.770 --> 09:26.770
I wanna crush him.

09:26.804 --> 09:27.871
You wanna crush him?

09:27.905 --> 09:29.239
Get over to the paper,

09:29.273 --> 09:31.207
kick the tires,
and figure out what it's worth.

09:31.242 --> 09:32.442
I thought we were supposed
to use

09:32.477 --> 09:33.777
the independent valuations.

09:33.812 --> 09:35.079
What, you think he's gonna
play by the rules?

09:35.113 --> 09:36.446
I know he won't.

09:36.481 --> 09:37.914
That's why you better be three
steps ahead of him,

09:37.949 --> 09:39.049
because I can guarantee you

09:39.083 --> 09:40.918
Louis'll be two steps
ahead of you.

09:40.952 --> 09:42.319
Speak of the devil,

09:42.353 --> 09:43.353
her majesty's here
to see you.

09:43.387 --> 09:44.454
- I heard that.
- You were meant to.

09:44.489 --> 09:46.457
- Gentlemen.
- Your highness.

09:46.491 --> 09:48.125
Okay, you know what?
That's exactly why I'm here.

09:48.160 --> 09:49.894
To be mocked?

09:49.928 --> 09:50.995
No, to set clear ground rules,

09:51.030 --> 09:52.764
to keep the negotiation
above board.

09:52.798 --> 09:53.965
Absolutely.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.433
No kicking, no biting,
and no rabbit punches.

09:55.468 --> 09:56.501
And now you're mocking
the ground rules.

09:56.536 --> 09:57.903
No, I'm just mocking you.

09:57.937 --> 09:59.371
Point one.

09:59.406 --> 10:01.440
We both agree to use
the independent valuations.

10:01.475 --> 10:03.242
Absolutely.
Good point.

10:03.277 --> 10:05.245
Point two.

10:05.279 --> 10:07.280
You do not call Jessica in
to mediate.

10:07.315 --> 10:08.749
This is you and me.

10:08.783 --> 10:10.083
You afraid mom's gonna take
my side?

10:10.118 --> 10:11.752
No, I know mom's gonna take
your side.

10:11.786 --> 10:13.487
- Because I'd be right.
- Point three.

10:13.521 --> 10:15.022
Chinese wall.

10:15.056 --> 10:17.157
You can't access any internal
documents that I create.

10:17.191 --> 10:18.358
Let's make Jessica proud.

10:18.392 --> 10:19.860
We do this right,
everyone walks away happy.

10:19.894 --> 10:21.795
Wonderful.

10:21.829 --> 10:23.363
Don't worry.
We'll still crush him.

10:23.397 --> 10:26.399
- I heard that.
- You were meant to.

10:31.038 --> 10:32.172
Care to make a wager?

10:32.206 --> 10:34.007
Our job is to make
both sisters happy.

10:34.041 --> 10:35.375
How do we know who wins?

10:35.409 --> 10:37.377
We'll know.

10:37.411 --> 10:38.812
- Usual amount?
- No.

10:38.846 --> 10:40.246
I think we should change it up
this time.

10:40.281 --> 10:42.949
I win, I get Mike.

10:42.983 --> 10:45.218
You can't bet me
like I'm chattel, Louis.

10:45.252 --> 10:46.352
It's not like
he's gonna win.

10:46.387 --> 10:48.188
- One month.
- Ten days.

10:48.222 --> 10:49.489
- Harvey.
- Two weeks.

10:49.523 --> 10:50.690
- Nine days.
- Harvey!

10:50.724 --> 10:53.059
All right, you know what?
Fine. Ten days.

10:53.093 --> 10:54.961
And in return?

10:54.995 --> 10:56.996
Well, that's tough
because anything you have

10:57.030 --> 10:59.231
I wouldn't want.

10:59.265 --> 11:01.567
What? Uh, you're gonna bet me
for nothing?

11:15.848 --> 11:18.182
Harvey?

11:18.217 --> 11:20.618
Harvey Specter.

11:20.652 --> 11:22.018
Alexandra Leeds.

11:22.053 --> 11:23.119
I hear you're working

11:23.154 --> 11:24.487
for the Attorney General's
office.

11:24.522 --> 11:26.056
And you're fighting
for the oppressive capitalists.

11:26.090 --> 11:27.923
Winning
for the oppressive capitalists.

11:27.958 --> 11:29.892
Oh, good for you.
We should have lunch.

11:29.926 --> 11:32.761
Catch up.

11:32.795 --> 11:34.830
Who told you
I was coming here tonight?

11:34.864 --> 11:37.032
No one.

11:37.066 --> 11:38.267
I haven't seen you
in five years.

11:38.301 --> 11:39.267
You wanna catch up?

11:39.302 --> 11:40.902
You want something
from me,

11:40.936 --> 11:42.804
and it isn't lunch.

11:42.839 --> 11:44.773
I want to talk
about Cameron Dennis.

11:44.807 --> 11:47.876
Six feet, Pisces, wavy hair.

11:47.911 --> 11:49.244
I'm serious.

11:49.279 --> 11:52.281
I haven't worked for Cameron
in over a decade.

11:52.315 --> 11:53.615
What's there to talk about?

11:53.650 --> 11:55.851
The Attorney General
is investigating allegations

11:55.885 --> 11:57.319
that he systematically
buried evidence

11:57.353 --> 11:58.921
to get convictions.

11:58.955 --> 12:01.723
So talk to people
who actually work with the guy.

12:01.758 --> 12:03.392
No, that's the problem.
He's still their boss.

12:03.426 --> 12:04.426
Nobody's talking.

12:04.460 --> 12:05.861
Neither am I.

12:05.895 --> 12:07.262
Over lunch
or anywhere else.

12:07.297 --> 12:08.597
So best of luck.

12:08.631 --> 12:11.266
Harvey.

12:11.301 --> 12:15.704
I was hoping
for some lunch.

12:15.739 --> 12:17.306
I'm having you subpoenaed

12:17.340 --> 12:18.974
to testify
before a grand jury.

12:19.008 --> 12:19.975
Enjoy your dinner.

12:20.009 --> 12:23.011
Give Cameron my best.

12:32.234 --> 12:34.402
Hey, Harvey.

12:34.436 --> 12:36.036
Glad you could make it.
How are you?

12:36.071 --> 12:37.204
Tell me about
the bullshit run-in

12:37.238 --> 12:38.238
that you staged this morning.

12:38.272 --> 12:39.573
How long did you have to wait

12:39.607 --> 12:42.608
so that you could pretend
to be surprised to see me?

12:42.643 --> 12:43.776
Ten minutes.

12:43.810 --> 12:44.944
You're never early,

12:44.978 --> 12:46.145
but I didn't want to cut it
too close.

12:46.179 --> 12:47.780
I also just had
another little run-in

12:47.814 --> 12:50.148
with Alexandra Leeds.

12:50.183 --> 12:52.484
You really want
to drag me into this?

12:52.518 --> 12:53.585
Calm down, Harvey.

12:53.619 --> 12:56.021
I'm not dragging you
into anything.

12:56.055 --> 12:57.488
They're dragging me
into this.

12:57.523 --> 13:00.025
It's election year nonsense,
and I wanted to warn you.

13:00.059 --> 13:02.093
So you asked me here
to warn me?

13:02.127 --> 13:06.164
Yeah, and to reassure myself
that you've got my back.

13:06.198 --> 13:07.899
How bad is it?

13:07.934 --> 13:09.067
It's nothing
I can't handle,

13:09.102 --> 13:10.569
but I'm glad you're here.

13:10.603 --> 13:12.738
Look, Harvey.

13:12.772 --> 13:14.940
Whatever differences we had,

13:14.975 --> 13:16.375
we were a good team.

13:16.409 --> 13:19.645
The truth is that...

13:19.679 --> 13:22.480
if anything taints
the work that we did,

13:22.515 --> 13:23.915
it'll be bad
for both of us.

13:23.950 --> 13:25.517
Is that a threat?

13:25.551 --> 13:27.786
Not at all.
It's just reality.

13:27.820 --> 13:28.954
We put away bad people, Harvey.

13:28.988 --> 13:31.423
We fought tough battles,
and we won.

13:31.457 --> 13:32.757
I taught you how to win.

13:32.792 --> 13:34.392
That's not exactly
what you taught me.

13:34.427 --> 13:36.094
I know that you didn't
always approve

13:36.128 --> 13:37.295
of the means,

13:37.329 --> 13:38.996
but we both know
that the end result

13:39.031 --> 13:41.099
was always right.

13:41.133 --> 13:42.934
You're still the best
smooth-talker I know.

13:42.968 --> 13:44.969
Use it now.
Talk your way out of this.

13:45.003 --> 13:46.070
Settle.

13:46.105 --> 13:47.272
'Cause if this goes to court,

13:47.306 --> 13:48.606
there are skeletons
to be found.

13:48.641 --> 13:51.443
They won't find them.

13:51.477 --> 13:52.877
You wanna bank on that?

13:52.911 --> 13:54.445
I have your back.

13:54.479 --> 13:56.080
I am not volunteering anything.

13:56.114 --> 13:57.448
But if push comes to shove,

13:57.482 --> 13:59.917
I won't perjure myself.

13:59.952 --> 14:01.919
Not even for you.

14:04.957 --> 14:12.963
♪ ♪

14:16.601 --> 14:21.704
How was dinner
with the antichrist?

14:21.738 --> 14:25.807
Subpoena came for you.

14:25.842 --> 14:27.576
What are you gonna do?

14:27.610 --> 14:30.144
What would you do?

14:30.179 --> 14:32.613
I'm sorry.
Are you feeling okay?

14:32.648 --> 14:34.615
You just asked my advice.

14:34.649 --> 14:36.550
All these years--
yeah, I think that's a first.

14:36.585 --> 14:38.086
You were there.
What would you do?

14:38.120 --> 14:39.387
I'd tell them everything.

14:39.422 --> 14:41.757
I'd watch Cameron go down.

14:41.791 --> 14:43.959
I'd throw a party.
I'd drink champagne.

14:43.994 --> 14:45.328
I'd go to bed,
and I'd sleep like a baby

14:45.362 --> 14:46.329
after I did it.

14:46.363 --> 14:48.465
Really?
Don't equivocate.

14:48.499 --> 14:49.633
He's poison, Harvey.

14:49.667 --> 14:51.434
Leaving there was huge.

14:51.469 --> 14:52.869
You could've gone
down a dark road.

14:52.904 --> 14:55.572
And I'm telling you,
I would not have followed.

14:55.607 --> 14:57.040
I just got back
from the paper.

14:57.075 --> 14:58.108
Nice place.

14:58.142 --> 14:59.243
It's a growing asset.

14:59.277 --> 15:01.011
There's opportunity
for expansion.

15:01.045 --> 15:03.013
If we get this thing
for Kelsey,

15:03.047 --> 15:06.016
I think she's set.

15:06.050 --> 15:07.283
I saw Elvis there.

15:07.318 --> 15:09.452
Great.

15:09.486 --> 15:11.287
Exciting.

15:11.321 --> 15:14.022
Am I interrupting something,
or...?

15:14.057 --> 15:15.624
Dinner didn't go well?

15:15.658 --> 15:17.760
It was okay.
Old times.

15:17.794 --> 15:19.495
If that's how
you want to play it.

15:19.530 --> 15:21.297
Let's talk about this proposal
for Louis.

15:21.331 --> 15:22.932
You know what?

15:22.966 --> 15:24.033
Why don't you take
a run at it?

15:24.067 --> 15:25.701
Get the best deal you can.

15:25.736 --> 15:28.604
You bet me, and now you're
hanging me out to dry?

15:28.639 --> 15:30.440
That's fine.
I'll do it.

15:30.474 --> 15:32.308
And I'll win.

15:32.343 --> 15:33.676
Oh, did you decide
what you want him to pay you

15:33.711 --> 15:34.778
when I win?

15:34.813 --> 15:36.947
His tickets
to <i>Nixon in China.</i>

15:36.982 --> 15:38.282
You want to go to the opera.

15:38.316 --> 15:39.784
No, but Louis does,

15:39.818 --> 15:41.152
and making him miss it
would be amusing.

15:41.186 --> 15:42.887
So you get nothing.

15:42.921 --> 15:44.622
You are betting me
for nothing.

15:44.657 --> 15:46.825
- Are you still talking?
- Right.

15:53.065 --> 15:55.066
So did you find a date
for tonight?

15:55.100 --> 15:57.368
Yep.

15:57.403 --> 15:58.536
And?

15:58.571 --> 16:00.472
And we'll see you there.

16:00.506 --> 16:02.807
What?

16:02.842 --> 16:04.409
I thought that's what
you said you wanted.

16:04.443 --> 16:05.443
To sit with you and Jenny

16:05.478 --> 16:06.544
and have her seeing
into my brain

16:06.579 --> 16:08.747
the whole time?

16:08.781 --> 16:10.716
Seeing what?

16:10.750 --> 16:12.985
You do remember
that we kissed, right?

16:13.019 --> 16:15.187
I remember.

16:15.221 --> 16:18.724
It'll be okay.

16:32.971 --> 16:33.937
Hi.

16:33.972 --> 16:35.072
Uh, is this a good time
to talk

16:35.106 --> 16:36.139
about division of assets?

16:36.174 --> 16:38.709
No.

16:38.744 --> 16:41.012
Is there a better time?

16:41.046 --> 16:43.682
Yes.
When Harvey's available.

16:43.716 --> 16:46.952
Harvey asked me
to handle it.

16:46.987 --> 16:48.254
He thinks you can beat me?

16:48.288 --> 16:49.355
Prove him wrong.

16:49.390 --> 16:50.657
What's there to lose?

16:50.691 --> 16:53.894
Ex--except for <i>Nixon in China,</i>
of course.

16:53.928 --> 16:56.129
What do you have for me?

16:56.164 --> 16:57.864
Okay, so there are
ten companies.

16:57.899 --> 16:59.866
We propose that Kelsey takes

16:59.901 --> 17:03.770
companies one, three,
seven, and nine.

17:03.805 --> 17:05.439
So that gives us...

17:05.473 --> 17:07.208
52.3% of the assets.

17:07.242 --> 17:10.109
Hm, generous, but no.

17:10.145 --> 17:12.280
Uh, alternatively,

17:12.314 --> 17:14.281
we propose that Kelsey takes

17:14.316 --> 17:16.851
companies one, two,
four, and eight.

17:16.886 --> 17:17.886
That gives you--

17:17.920 --> 17:19.554
54.6%.

17:19.589 --> 17:20.989
No.

17:21.022 --> 17:22.324
Do you have
a counterproposal, or--

17:22.358 --> 17:24.160
No.

17:24.194 --> 17:27.363
Okay, uh, Kelsey takes
companies one, seven,

17:27.397 --> 17:29.432
eight, and nine.
No.

17:29.466 --> 17:31.501
Louis, that gives you 60%
of the assets.

17:31.535 --> 17:35.005
Yes.
But no.

17:35.039 --> 17:39.276
What is it
your client wants?

17:39.310 --> 17:41.945
Well, your offer
makes it infinitely clear

17:41.979 --> 17:43.313
what your client wants.

17:43.347 --> 17:44.948
The tabloid.

17:44.982 --> 17:47.416
And what my client wants
is for your client

17:47.451 --> 17:48.617
to not get what she wants,

17:48.651 --> 17:51.653
so you can't have
the tabloid, period.

17:51.688 --> 17:53.288
You're legally required
to take these offers

17:53.322 --> 17:54.322
to your client.

17:54.357 --> 17:55.624
So bring me up
on ethics charges.

17:55.658 --> 17:57.926
Or report me
to your supervisor.

17:57.961 --> 18:00.595
Oh, wait, shit.
I am your supervisor.

18:00.630 --> 18:03.632
Hold on one second.

18:06.469 --> 18:08.705
Go ahead.

18:08.739 --> 18:09.873
What are your complaints?

18:09.907 --> 18:11.908
Have any? No? Really?

18:16.781 --> 18:17.848
We're supposed to find

18:17.882 --> 18:19.149
a fair and equitable settlement,
Louis.

18:19.183 --> 18:21.151
Okay, you go run
and tell Jessica.

18:21.186 --> 18:22.820
Oh, wait, that would be
breaking the rules,

18:22.855 --> 18:24.522
and then you've have to come
work for me.

18:24.556 --> 18:26.057
So why don't you run along now
and get Harvey

18:26.091 --> 18:27.625
and tell him
to get off his ass

18:27.660 --> 18:29.261
and join the negotiations.

18:29.295 --> 18:32.264
Because you just failed.

18:32.298 --> 18:35.100
When you left
the D.A.'s office,

18:35.135 --> 18:36.368
you said you were done,

18:36.403 --> 18:37.369
you had learned enough,

18:37.404 --> 18:39.071
and that you were ready
to move on.

18:39.105 --> 18:40.839
Was that just bullshit?

18:40.873 --> 18:42.574
You were the one who wanted me
to have trial experience.

18:42.609 --> 18:43.876
You said that Cameron
was the only one

18:43.910 --> 18:44.943
that I should learn from.

18:44.978 --> 18:46.511
And what exactly
did he teach you?

18:46.546 --> 18:50.549
Harvey, why did you leave?

18:50.583 --> 18:51.883
He had a case.

18:51.917 --> 18:54.585
I caught him burying
a key piece of evidence

18:54.620 --> 18:56.387
he was obligated
to turn over.

18:56.422 --> 18:57.588
The guy was guilty.

18:57.623 --> 19:00.391
The defense would've used it
to let him walk.

19:00.425 --> 19:02.126
All right, what kind
of exposure do you have?

19:02.160 --> 19:03.427
I told him no,
but he didn't listen.

19:03.462 --> 19:04.795
Then you were obligated
to report him.

19:04.830 --> 19:06.264
Which is why I left.

19:06.298 --> 19:07.765
Why didn't you tell me this
at the time?

19:07.799 --> 19:08.900
Because you put me there,
Jessica,

19:08.934 --> 19:09.901
to be mentored.

19:09.935 --> 19:11.702
Okay? And it occurred to me,

19:11.737 --> 19:15.206
that might've been exactly
what you wanted me to learn.

19:15.240 --> 19:19.210
For the record,
it wasn't.

19:19.244 --> 19:20.745
I'm gonna represent you
at this deposition.

19:20.779 --> 19:25.650
I'm gonna try to keep you
from talking.

19:25.684 --> 19:28.920
But I think you should.

19:28.954 --> 19:29.921
He was my mentor.

19:29.955 --> 19:31.389
He is a public servant.

19:31.423 --> 19:32.423
He was my mentor.

19:32.457 --> 19:33.924
The standards are higher.

19:33.958 --> 19:35.425
He was my mentor.

19:35.460 --> 19:37.728
And I am not gonna be
the one to expose him,

19:37.762 --> 19:39.963
any more than I'd ever turn
on you.

19:50.900 --> 19:54.115
Worst dating story--
identical twins.

19:54.116 --> 19:56.017
I was a lab rat
for their social experiment.

19:56.052 --> 19:58.119
They were trying to prove
that women were shallow

19:58.153 --> 19:59.787
and can't see
beyond the surface.

19:59.821 --> 20:00.888
And they wanted to get laid.

20:00.923 --> 20:02.757
Yes, that too.

20:02.791 --> 20:04.259
Good times.

20:04.293 --> 20:06.561
So you slept with them both.

20:06.595 --> 20:07.963
Almost.

20:07.997 --> 20:11.133
Turns out they weren't identical
after all.

20:11.167 --> 20:12.701
Wow.

20:12.736 --> 20:14.970
Excuse me, I am just going
to run to the ladies' room.

20:15.005 --> 20:16.105
Oh, I'll go with you.

20:16.139 --> 20:19.141
Okay.

20:23.547 --> 20:24.914
What's wrong, Mikey?

20:24.948 --> 20:26.282
Tough day at the office?

20:26.316 --> 20:28.083
Didn't see you.
It could've been worse.

20:28.118 --> 20:29.084
That's good.

20:29.118 --> 20:30.685
So you and Rachel.

20:30.720 --> 20:32.487
How long have you guys
been dating?

20:32.521 --> 20:34.723
You know how lawyers
and clients work close

20:34.757 --> 20:36.524
over the course of a trial.

20:36.559 --> 20:38.760
When we kicked your ass
in the mock trial,

20:38.794 --> 20:41.929
we, uh, bonded.

20:41.963 --> 20:43.197
You know
in the real world

20:43.231 --> 20:45.800
dating clients is a violation
of ethics, right?

20:45.834 --> 20:47.969
Good thing it's not
the real world.

20:48.003 --> 20:50.237
'Cause I intend to violate
those ethics

20:50.272 --> 20:52.239
all night.

20:52.274 --> 20:54.476
You know the funny thing?

20:54.510 --> 20:56.979
I always thought
you'd get there first.

20:57.013 --> 20:58.814
I'll tell you how she is.

20:58.849 --> 20:59.916
Shut up, Kyle.

20:59.950 --> 21:01.550
Someone might think
you're jealous.

21:01.585 --> 21:02.785
Someone might think
you're a dick.

21:02.820 --> 21:05.488
Oh, wait.
Somebody already does.

21:05.522 --> 21:07.189
That's good.
You should write that one down.

21:07.224 --> 21:08.357
Do you keep a journal
of these things?

21:08.391 --> 21:09.358
Finish your tofu.

21:09.392 --> 21:10.659
So how did you two meet?

21:10.693 --> 21:13.629
Um...

21:13.663 --> 21:17.332
I dated his best friend.

21:17.367 --> 21:18.600
I know, it's awful.

21:18.635 --> 21:23.205
But he was a bad guy,
and I didn't see it.

21:23.239 --> 21:25.540
Mike showed me.

21:25.575 --> 21:26.675
The truth is, I--

21:26.709 --> 21:29.177
I think there was always
something there with us.

21:29.212 --> 21:31.947
But nothing happened until
Trevor and I were totally done.

21:31.981 --> 21:34.617
Never?

21:34.651 --> 21:38.087
Well, we did kiss once.

21:43.027 --> 21:43.994
Hey, having fun?

21:44.028 --> 21:45.162
Loads.
Right, Mike?

21:45.196 --> 21:46.697
I think we're gonna go.

21:46.731 --> 21:48.065
What? No.
We're having fun.

21:48.100 --> 21:49.400
Come on, you don't want
to ruin this.

21:49.434 --> 21:51.002
- Yeah.
- Kyle, really, just--

21:51.037 --> 21:52.771
okay, Kyle, just--

21:52.805 --> 21:53.805
What? What's the problem?

21:53.839 --> 21:57.343
Stop it.
She doesn't like it.

22:06.919 --> 22:08.186
God, that guy is such a tool.

22:08.221 --> 22:10.255
So what?
He's not your date.

22:10.289 --> 22:11.589
Yeah, well,
I have to work with him.

22:11.624 --> 22:12.924
That's not why
it bothers you.

22:12.958 --> 22:14.559
He's with Rachel,
and you know it.

22:14.593 --> 22:16.494
Oh, my God, Jenny.
We have been over this.

22:16.528 --> 22:18.996
I've seen the way
you look at her.

22:19.030 --> 22:22.433
I've seen it before.

22:22.467 --> 22:23.968
It's the way
you used to look at me

22:24.002 --> 22:25.036
when I was with Trevor.

22:25.070 --> 22:26.604
Jenny--

22:26.639 --> 22:28.673
I'm going home, Mike.

22:28.707 --> 22:30.842
Decide what you want.

22:30.877 --> 22:34.380
In or out.

22:34.414 --> 22:36.316
I like you.

22:36.350 --> 22:39.352
A lot.

22:39.387 --> 22:41.388
But you can't have both.

22:49.731 --> 22:51.865
I worked as an assistant
district attorney

22:51.899 --> 22:53.366
for the county of New York
for two years.

22:53.401 --> 22:54.968
Tell me about your
relationship

22:55.003 --> 22:55.969
with Cameron Dennis.

22:56.004 --> 22:57.471
Vague.

22:57.505 --> 23:00.941
Did you and district attorney
Cameron Dennis

23:00.975 --> 23:02.909
work closely together?

23:02.943 --> 23:05.579
He was my boss.
He supervised all my cases.

23:05.613 --> 23:07.414
And were you personally close?

23:07.448 --> 23:09.449
- Subjective.
- A judge would allow it.

23:09.483 --> 23:12.752
And yet there's
not one here.

23:12.787 --> 23:14.688
Do you really think
by deposing him on the stand

23:14.722 --> 23:16.290
you're going to intimidate him?

23:16.324 --> 23:17.958
I think deposing him here
will let him know

23:17.992 --> 23:19.960
what it will be like
if this evidence

23:19.994 --> 23:21.394
is brought forward at trial.

23:21.429 --> 23:23.229
You're not getting
to trial.

23:23.264 --> 23:25.165
If your client doesn't
perjure himself right now,

23:25.199 --> 23:27.233
I won't have to.

23:27.267 --> 23:30.669
Were you and Cameron Dennis
close personally?

23:30.704 --> 23:32.571
He was my mentor.

23:32.605 --> 23:34.005
It's a hard relationship
to define.

23:34.040 --> 23:35.240
Moving on, counselor.

23:35.274 --> 23:36.441
All right.

23:36.476 --> 23:40.211
We don't have to talk
about Mr. Dennis.

23:40.246 --> 23:42.947
Let's talk about you,
Mr. Specter.

23:42.982 --> 23:47.586
In two years,
you handled 18,362 cases.

23:47.620 --> 23:49.188
36 cases a day.

23:49.222 --> 23:50.689
That's beyond impressive.

23:50.724 --> 23:52.758
Thank you.

23:52.792 --> 23:55.461
You took 147 to trial,
winning them all.

23:55.495 --> 23:57.730
Don't go to trial
if you're not gonna win.

23:57.764 --> 23:59.265
Why'd you leave?

23:59.299 --> 24:01.901
An attorney by the name
of Jessica Pearson

24:01.935 --> 24:03.202
helped me get
through law school,

24:03.236 --> 24:06.538
and she felt that I could use
trial experience.

24:06.573 --> 24:11.309
But I always planned
on ending up at her firm

24:11.344 --> 24:13.678
and paying her back
by earning that firm

24:13.713 --> 24:15.113
outrageous settlements.

24:15.147 --> 24:16.348
How am I doing?

24:16.382 --> 24:18.183
You could do better.

24:18.217 --> 24:19.851
You two think
that this is a joke.

24:19.885 --> 24:21.286
Argumentative.

24:21.320 --> 24:23.021
You're damn right
it's argumentative.

24:23.056 --> 24:24.490
Because he knows
that laws have been broken,

24:24.524 --> 24:26.191
and he has an obligation
to report it.

24:26.225 --> 24:27.359
Ms. Leeds--

24:27.393 --> 24:28.861
But if this is the way
you want to play it,

24:28.895 --> 24:30.129
the Attorney General
has given me

24:30.163 --> 24:32.665
a broad mandate to uncover
what went on.

24:32.699 --> 24:35.468
And it need not be limited
to Mr. Dennis.

24:35.503 --> 24:38.038
Were you part of the problem,
Mr. Specter?

24:38.073 --> 24:39.039
Vague.

24:39.074 --> 24:40.941
I'll rephrase.

24:40.976 --> 24:43.477
In your capacity
as assistant district attorney

24:43.512 --> 24:45.012
in the county of New York,

24:45.046 --> 24:47.147
did you knowingly
suppress evidence

24:47.182 --> 24:48.815
in violation
of the A.V.A. Rules of Conduct,

24:48.850 --> 24:50.417
the N.D.A.A. Standards,

24:50.451 --> 24:54.687
and the New York State Bar
Rule 8.4, section c?

24:54.721 --> 24:55.888
My client would like
to exercise

24:55.922 --> 24:58.990
his fifth amendment rights
at this time.

25:04.697 --> 25:05.864
I hear you botched
a settlement

25:05.898 --> 25:07.299
by negotiating against yourself.

25:07.333 --> 25:09.101
I didn't--

25:09.135 --> 25:10.736
You let Louis know
the one thing

25:10.770 --> 25:12.138
that was most important
to our client.

25:12.172 --> 25:13.139
Okay, yes,
I made a mistake.

25:13.173 --> 25:14.707
But Louis made one too.

25:14.741 --> 25:15.842
Well, he didn't mention that.

25:15.876 --> 25:17.477
Yes, he knows
what our client wants,

25:17.511 --> 25:19.212
but now we know the one thing
his client wants.

25:19.247 --> 25:21.215
She doesn't care
about winning, Harvey.

25:21.249 --> 25:23.584
She just wants our client
to lose.

25:23.618 --> 25:26.153
Okay, well, that's good.
So what's next?

25:26.188 --> 25:27.154
We lose.

25:27.189 --> 25:28.389
We give her the tabloid.

25:28.423 --> 25:29.890
Well, how does that make
our client happy?

25:29.925 --> 25:31.192
We let Madison have
the paper,

25:31.226 --> 25:32.926
and then we take
everyone who works there,

25:32.961 --> 25:34.428
and we start a new one.

25:34.462 --> 25:36.229
They all love Kelsey.

25:36.264 --> 25:37.731
<i>Nothing But the Truth</i>
is just a name.

25:37.765 --> 25:38.832
We let Madison have it.

25:38.866 --> 25:41.735
I have taught you
a thing or two.

25:41.769 --> 25:44.271
Well, I see that you're
up to speed.

25:44.305 --> 25:45.572
Well, as am I.

25:45.606 --> 25:47.240
Um, I noticed that there were
some employee issues

25:47.275 --> 25:48.308
at the tabloid.

25:48.342 --> 25:49.509
You know,
contracts about to expire.

25:49.544 --> 25:51.345
So I just want
to let you guys know

25:51.379 --> 25:54.482
that I went ahead and locked up
all the key employees.

25:54.516 --> 25:56.083
Just to protect us.

25:56.117 --> 25:59.920
Since we're all working on this
together, right?

25:59.954 --> 26:01.989
- Mm-hmm.
- Good.

26:05.192 --> 26:06.159
- He knows.
- He can't.

26:06.194 --> 26:08.161
- He does.
- I was careful.

26:08.196 --> 26:09.830
I deleted every file
from the server.

26:09.865 --> 26:12.132
The only time any paper trail
left my locked desk

26:12.166 --> 26:13.300
is when I faxed it
to Kelsey.

26:13.334 --> 26:14.801
Oh, you faxed it.

26:14.836 --> 26:16.336
From the large machine

26:16.371 --> 26:17.938
that stores all the information
you put in it

26:17.972 --> 26:20.140
to be printed back later
by anyone who has your code?

26:20.174 --> 26:21.141
He can't do that.

26:21.175 --> 26:23.176
We have a Chinese wall thingy.

26:23.211 --> 26:24.611
Oh, God, he's gonna beat us,
isn't he?

26:24.645 --> 26:26.580
Look, he knows what
we're up to,

26:26.614 --> 26:28.815
but he couldn't keep his tactics
to himself.

26:28.850 --> 26:29.984
So we can use that
against him.

26:30.018 --> 26:32.420
And that's how
we'll crush Louis.

26:32.454 --> 26:34.121
Refresher course, Harvey.

26:34.155 --> 26:36.123
You and Louis
aren't opponents on this one.

26:36.157 --> 26:37.291
You're working together.

26:37.325 --> 26:39.026
Like Captain & Tennille?

26:39.061 --> 26:40.995
Well, if so, he's Tennille.

26:41.029 --> 26:44.432
Who?

26:44.466 --> 26:46.400
You need to come with me.

26:46.434 --> 26:47.501
What, am I in trouble?

26:47.536 --> 26:50.537
Yeah, Harvey.
You are.

26:59.979 --> 27:02.247
Gonna buy me a drink
before you screw me?

27:02.281 --> 27:03.381
Sit down, Harvey.

27:03.416 --> 27:06.952
Listen to what she has
to say.

27:06.986 --> 27:11.290
You got me trembling
in my boots.

27:11.324 --> 27:12.491
You're a small fish,

27:12.525 --> 27:14.326
and you don't even swim
in the pond anymore.

27:14.360 --> 27:16.361
But if I have to eat you alive
to get to Cameron Dennis,

27:16.395 --> 27:19.297
I will.

27:19.331 --> 27:20.298
This is my case against him.

27:20.332 --> 27:22.567
Falsifying DNA tests,

27:22.601 --> 27:24.169
coerced confessions,

27:24.203 --> 27:26.204
testimony buried.

27:26.239 --> 27:29.407
You have all this.
Why do you need me?

27:29.442 --> 27:31.710
Because this is circumstantial.

27:31.744 --> 27:33.045
You have the crimes,

27:33.079 --> 27:34.413
but you can't physically tie
them to Cameron.

27:34.447 --> 27:35.848
He's a dirty public servant,

27:35.882 --> 27:38.384
and I think
it's why you left.

27:38.418 --> 27:40.386
Your record was too good
to just walk away.

27:40.420 --> 27:41.487
Maybe I got greedy.

27:41.522 --> 27:43.122
- Harvey.
- I'm not testifying.

27:43.157 --> 27:44.157
You're being stubborn.

27:44.191 --> 27:45.191
And this isn't one

27:45.226 --> 27:47.893
where you get to make
the call.

27:47.927 --> 27:50.629
I'm sorry.

27:50.663 --> 27:52.597
I've done all I can.

27:52.632 --> 27:55.833
It wasn't just his cases
he cheated on.

27:55.868 --> 27:57.368
Hector Avila.

27:57.402 --> 27:58.569
Take a look.

27:58.603 --> 28:00.538
You think you were really
that great?

28:00.572 --> 28:02.139
You think your
great track record

28:02.174 --> 28:04.075
was because of your skill?

28:04.109 --> 28:07.512
I got two theories here, Harvey.

28:07.546 --> 28:09.080
Either you're wasting your time
protecting a man

28:09.115 --> 28:10.448
who screwed you
from the beginning,

28:10.483 --> 28:13.051
or you didn't just know
he did this.

28:13.086 --> 28:14.219
You participated.

28:14.254 --> 28:17.256
In which case
I'll have you disbarred.

28:26.068 --> 28:27.402
Come on.
Come on.

28:27.436 --> 28:29.604
Damn it.

28:29.639 --> 28:30.605
What are you doing?

28:30.640 --> 28:31.907
Uh, nothing.

28:31.941 --> 28:35.344
I'm just sending
some faxes.

28:35.378 --> 28:37.813
Stand down.

28:37.847 --> 28:39.181
They're stuck, Donna.

28:39.216 --> 28:40.415
What are you gonna do?

28:40.450 --> 28:43.351
I'm the fax whisperer.

28:43.386 --> 28:45.453
Okay, that's ridiculous,
all right?

28:45.488 --> 28:46.588
I've tried everything.

28:46.622 --> 28:47.856
I've hit--
I've already done that.

28:47.890 --> 28:50.625
And it didn't--

28:50.659 --> 28:52.293
whatever.

28:52.327 --> 28:54.296
United International
wants to buy the tabloid?

28:54.330 --> 28:56.831
Uh, whatever you do,
don't say anything to Louis.

28:56.866 --> 28:58.700
Kelsey Price
does not want to sell.

28:58.735 --> 29:00.136
Not a word.

29:00.170 --> 29:03.172
Thanks.

29:16.788 --> 29:19.323
Whoa.
Something explode in here?

29:19.357 --> 29:21.658
Just doing some research.

29:21.693 --> 29:25.962
Yeah, 'cause you always do
your own research.

29:25.997 --> 29:28.231
Okay, closed-door meeting
with Donna,

29:28.266 --> 29:30.166
with Jessica.

29:30.201 --> 29:33.436
Dinner with some D.A. you've
never even mentioned before.

29:33.470 --> 29:36.439
Is this all something
Cameron Dennis taught you?

29:36.474 --> 29:38.108
Keep secrets from everyone
because you're so good,

29:38.142 --> 29:39.410
you don't need
anyone's help?

29:39.444 --> 29:42.212
There's an investigation
into evidence tampering.

29:42.247 --> 29:46.685
I've been asked to testify
against my old boss...

29:46.719 --> 29:49.922
or face charges myself.

29:49.956 --> 29:53.392
You could be disbarred.

29:53.427 --> 29:56.562
If I'm found guilty.

29:56.596 --> 29:58.464
Are you guilty?

29:58.498 --> 30:00.065
Not of evidence tampering.

30:00.100 --> 30:01.300
I would never do that.

30:01.334 --> 30:02.534
Of anything else?

30:02.569 --> 30:03.769
Anything I ever did,

30:03.803 --> 30:05.504
you put me in front
of an unbiased judge,

30:05.538 --> 30:06.872
I walk away clean.

30:06.906 --> 30:08.874
You put me in a courtroom
with a grand jury,

30:08.908 --> 30:11.477
anything can happen.

30:11.511 --> 30:13.579
So are you gonna testify?

30:13.613 --> 30:15.248
I'm not sure
what choice I have.

30:15.282 --> 30:18.352
Well, some dickhead
once told me

30:18.386 --> 30:21.255
that when they put a gun
to your head,

30:21.289 --> 30:23.458
it's not just give in
or be killed.

30:23.492 --> 30:28.096
There are 146 other options.

30:28.130 --> 30:29.664
You'll figure something out.

30:32.168 --> 30:33.935
I'll have a proposal for you
in the morning,

30:33.969 --> 30:35.503
and I think
we'll all be happy.

30:35.538 --> 30:37.238
All right?

30:37.272 --> 30:40.408
Night.

30:40.442 --> 30:42.543
He took the bait?

30:42.577 --> 30:44.277
Like shooting a fish
in a barrel.

30:44.312 --> 30:47.313
Good work.

30:49.450 --> 30:50.783
Where you going?

30:50.817 --> 30:53.819
I just might take
your advice.

31:13.407 --> 31:14.374
The tides are turning.

31:14.408 --> 31:16.676
You turning with them,
Harvey?

31:16.711 --> 31:18.178
They turn you?

31:18.213 --> 31:21.782
Hector Avila.

31:21.817 --> 31:22.983
You don't even know,
do you?

31:23.018 --> 31:24.785
Is this some old case?

31:24.820 --> 31:27.621
It's my old case,
and you buried evidence.

31:27.656 --> 31:30.891
You wearing a wire,
Harvey?

31:30.926 --> 31:33.494
No, you're not.

31:33.528 --> 31:34.895
I can tell.

31:34.929 --> 31:37.130
I'm not that easy to read
anymore, Cameron.

31:37.165 --> 31:38.632
You are to me.

31:38.666 --> 31:39.899
Hector Avila.

31:39.934 --> 31:41.668
Was he guilty,
whoever he was?

31:41.702 --> 31:43.536
- He was my case.
- Guilty is guilty.

31:43.570 --> 31:44.903
That's not the way
the system works.

31:44.938 --> 31:46.638
The system is broken,
and you know it.

31:46.673 --> 31:48.006
It's not reasonable doubt.

31:48.041 --> 31:50.575
Juries want to be sure
without a shadow of a doubt.

31:50.610 --> 31:51.944
It was my case.

31:51.978 --> 31:53.212
You worked for me.

31:53.246 --> 31:56.983
They were all my cases.

31:57.018 --> 31:57.984
You're a disappointment.

31:58.019 --> 31:59.286
No.

31:59.320 --> 32:00.988
You're the disappointment.

32:01.022 --> 32:02.556
You could've been D.A. yourself.

32:02.591 --> 32:04.625
You are twice the lawyer
than any of the pricks lined up

32:04.660 --> 32:05.693
to run against me.

32:05.727 --> 32:06.861
But you sold out.

32:06.895 --> 32:08.229
You help rich people
keep their money.

32:08.264 --> 32:09.397
That's all you do.

32:09.431 --> 32:12.300
I stack my value to society
against yours,

32:12.334 --> 32:15.335
and I win by a mile.

32:17.471 --> 32:18.838
So you're selling me out?

32:18.873 --> 32:20.540
We both know they don't want
to put you in jail.

32:20.574 --> 32:22.542
That's not what this
is about.

32:22.576 --> 32:25.310
Walk away, Cameron.
Make a deal.

32:25.345 --> 32:27.246
Let someone else be D.A.,
and all of this,

32:27.280 --> 32:28.513
it goes away.

32:28.548 --> 32:29.614
Otherwise?

32:29.649 --> 32:31.583
You know what happens
if you talk.

32:31.617 --> 32:33.385
They start reopening cases.

32:33.420 --> 32:35.054
Maybe Hector Avila
walks away.

32:35.088 --> 32:36.856
He murdered once.
He'll murder again.

32:36.891 --> 32:38.525
You do remember him
don't you?

32:38.559 --> 32:39.593
Oh, I remember 'em all.

32:39.627 --> 32:40.760
Maxwell Rankin?

32:40.795 --> 32:44.231
What was it, uh,
34 or 35 women that he raped?

32:44.266 --> 32:46.100
Alberto Plank?
You remember him?

32:46.134 --> 32:48.136
He burned his children alive.

32:48.170 --> 32:49.437
You'll open the floodgates,
Harvey.

32:49.472 --> 32:50.639
Do you want that
on your conscience?

32:50.673 --> 32:52.640
Then make a deal.

32:52.675 --> 32:55.643
It's on you
to keep them in jail.

32:55.677 --> 32:59.879
Okay.

32:59.914 --> 33:03.149
Okay, Harvey.

33:03.183 --> 33:04.250
You win.

33:04.284 --> 33:08.387
This isn't winning.

33:08.421 --> 33:09.721
Good to see you, Harvey.

33:09.756 --> 33:12.757
Let's do it again soon.

33:17.514 --> 33:19.282
So your client's really
willing to give Madison

33:19.316 --> 33:20.884
<i>Nothing But the Truth?</i>

33:20.918 --> 33:22.753
You made it clear
it was non-negotiable.

33:22.787 --> 33:26.123
I convinced my client
to settle.

33:26.157 --> 33:27.624
She wants to move on.

33:27.659 --> 33:28.959
You're sure
there isn't anything

33:28.993 --> 33:31.694
that you want to, uh,
disclose?

33:31.729 --> 33:33.796
Nope.

33:33.831 --> 33:36.999
I think we're good.

33:37.034 --> 33:40.035
Then we're good.

33:42.405 --> 33:43.639
Everybody's happy.

33:43.673 --> 33:46.141
Mm-hmm.

33:46.176 --> 33:49.178
As clams.

33:51.583 --> 33:53.818
Thank you, Louis.

33:53.852 --> 33:56.554
You, um...

33:56.588 --> 33:57.855
Happy with the deal?

33:57.890 --> 33:59.557
Yeah, as a matter of fact,
I am.

33:59.591 --> 34:01.993
You?

34:05.264 --> 34:07.265
You don't even know
the half of it.

34:07.299 --> 34:08.632
Don't I?

34:08.667 --> 34:10.568
Are you happy that your client
got the paper

34:10.601 --> 34:14.505
or that you turned around
and sold it?

34:14.540 --> 34:17.976
Oh, you didn't think I knew
about that, did you?

34:18.010 --> 34:20.579
Want to know why
I'm happy, Louis?

34:20.612 --> 34:23.114
I'm happy because when you read
over that offer

34:23.149 --> 34:24.817
from United International,

34:24.851 --> 34:27.219
I wanted you to read that.

34:27.253 --> 34:29.255
I wanted you to sell
to them.

34:29.289 --> 34:31.389
Because the thing
you didn't know

34:31.424 --> 34:36.762
is that yesterday Kelsey Price
bought United International.

34:36.795 --> 34:39.197
You shouldn't go
behind people's backs, Louis.

34:39.232 --> 34:41.065
You shouldn't try
and access information

34:41.100 --> 34:43.168
that's none of your business.

34:43.202 --> 34:44.636
It could backfire.

34:44.670 --> 34:47.706
Mm.

34:50.577 --> 34:54.147
I think we need to talk
to Harvey.

34:54.181 --> 34:55.282
I'm sorry, Harvey.

34:55.315 --> 34:56.350
You set me up.

34:56.384 --> 34:58.619
No, Louis.
You set yourself up.

34:58.653 --> 35:00.955
The sales offer
was meaningless

35:00.989 --> 35:02.457
until you read it.

35:02.491 --> 35:05.126
This is cheating.

35:05.161 --> 35:06.628
You cheated, Louis.

35:06.662 --> 35:09.598
You broke the rules,
and you have to pay the price.

35:09.632 --> 35:12.334
People may think that lawyers
will do anything,

35:12.368 --> 35:13.702
that they can do anything.

35:13.736 --> 35:15.804
Now, I'm not willing
to accept that, okay?

35:15.838 --> 35:17.706
You can't go skirting
the rules

35:17.740 --> 35:19.507
and justify it
because you think someone else

35:19.542 --> 35:20.642
broke the rules, okay?

35:20.676 --> 35:22.344
You cheated!

35:22.378 --> 35:23.745
And you lost!

35:23.779 --> 35:25.947
End of story.

35:32.188 --> 35:37.025
Harvey, I won.

35:37.060 --> 35:40.296
His play acting
by the fax machine

35:40.330 --> 35:41.464
was so obvious.

35:41.498 --> 35:43.700
I found out Kelsey owned
United International,

35:43.734 --> 35:45.435
and I thought if they wanted
the paper so badly,

35:45.469 --> 35:47.904
how much would they overpay
for it?

35:47.938 --> 35:51.073
50%.

35:51.108 --> 35:53.008
Harvey, you overpaid 50%
for a business

35:53.042 --> 35:54.009
so buried in expenses

35:54.043 --> 35:56.378
from the employee deals
that I made,

35:56.412 --> 35:57.979
it can barely stay afloat.

35:58.014 --> 36:00.048
And then all I had to do
was convince Madison

36:00.082 --> 36:03.151
to sit back, have fun,
watch her sister fail miserably.

36:03.185 --> 36:04.419
I won.

36:04.453 --> 36:07.022
Your client got
what she wanted.

36:07.056 --> 36:08.090
So did ours.

36:08.124 --> 36:09.224
Jessica asked to make
everyone happy.

36:09.259 --> 36:13.363
Everyone's happy.
It's a draw.

36:13.397 --> 36:14.865
Just hold on a second.

36:14.899 --> 36:17.434
You tell me the truth
right now.

36:17.468 --> 36:18.936
Is this a win to you?

36:18.970 --> 36:20.671
Fine, Louis.
You win.

36:20.706 --> 36:22.340
You were a step ahead.
You got Mike.

36:22.374 --> 36:23.341
Ten days.

36:23.375 --> 36:26.812
You think I'd want him now?

36:26.846 --> 36:31.516
I just wiped the floor
with him.

36:31.551 --> 36:34.553
You can keep him.

36:41.761 --> 36:43.295
How can I help you?

36:43.330 --> 36:44.530
I'm not gonna let him
take the fall

36:44.564 --> 36:47.333
for that asshole.

36:47.368 --> 36:49.369
Have a seat.

36:54.809 --> 36:56.877
Harvey didn't see it
for a long time.

36:56.912 --> 36:59.413
I mean, Cameron's good
when he wants to be.

36:59.448 --> 37:02.083
You know how I judge
a man's character?

37:02.117 --> 37:03.952
Not by how he treats
his equals,

37:03.986 --> 37:07.455
but by how he treats
the underlings.

37:07.490 --> 37:10.459
Lowest rungs on the ladder.

37:10.493 --> 37:14.096
You always impressed me
in that regard.

37:14.130 --> 37:17.099
Thank you.

37:17.133 --> 37:18.800
Harvey would never use this,

37:18.835 --> 37:20.835
and he'd kill me
if he knew I had it.

37:20.870 --> 37:24.105
But can you help him?

37:24.139 --> 37:27.141
Can you use this
to help him?

37:40.390 --> 37:43.392
Is Harvey punishing you
for something?

37:43.426 --> 37:45.160
Louis.

37:45.195 --> 37:46.261
No! You lost?

37:46.296 --> 37:47.562
You have to work for him?

37:47.597 --> 37:50.365
I lost, and then he said
he didn't want me.

37:50.399 --> 37:51.366
He farmed me out.

37:51.400 --> 37:52.600
Oh, I'm so sorry.

37:52.635 --> 37:57.539
Is there anything I can do
to help?

37:57.573 --> 38:00.608
What?

38:00.643 --> 38:02.277
That.

38:02.311 --> 38:05.313
What are you talking about?

38:09.251 --> 38:10.284
I wanted you for months.

38:10.318 --> 38:12.353
Rachel, I flirted.

38:12.387 --> 38:14.655
I-I-I made up some scheme
where we were married.

38:14.689 --> 38:16.223
And you made it clear

38:16.258 --> 38:19.160
you don't date anyone
from the office.

38:19.194 --> 38:20.428
Until I start seeing
someone else.

38:20.462 --> 38:21.996
Okay, you're delusional.

38:22.030 --> 38:24.098
Why did you bring Kyle
on that date?

38:24.132 --> 38:26.367
Because it was last-minute

38:26.401 --> 38:27.968
and because you needed me
to help convince your girlfriend

38:28.002 --> 38:29.436
that you don't like me.

38:29.470 --> 38:31.504
You did it to get to me.

38:31.539 --> 38:32.605
This is crazy.
It's just stupid.

38:32.640 --> 38:34.641
You don't even like
the guy, Rachel.

38:34.675 --> 38:37.711
Jenny comes to drop off a suit
at the office,

38:37.745 --> 38:39.212
and what do you do?

38:39.246 --> 38:40.814
You kiss me.

38:40.848 --> 38:43.283
You know, I seem to recall
you kissing me too.

38:43.317 --> 38:44.350
Yeah, that's the problem.

38:44.385 --> 38:46.185
I did.
And it was great.

38:46.220 --> 38:47.286
But it's too late.

38:47.320 --> 38:49.321
You were too late.

38:49.356 --> 38:50.356
And I can't do any of this.

38:50.390 --> 38:52.124
- Do what?
- This, this.

38:52.159 --> 38:54.259
This you joking
about your first time or--

38:54.294 --> 38:58.097
or rubbing my shoulders
or--or touching my arm.

38:58.131 --> 39:00.333
You're playing with me,
and you know it.

39:00.367 --> 39:02.235
What I know is
you're playing with me too.

39:02.269 --> 39:03.503
You kept flirting with me

39:03.537 --> 39:05.137
long after you started
dating her.

39:05.172 --> 39:08.909
Yeah, well,
that's gonna stop.

39:08.943 --> 39:09.976
Good.

39:10.011 --> 39:11.811
You know,
and while you're at it,

39:11.846 --> 39:13.714
no more running to me
for favors

39:13.748 --> 39:15.082
or asking me for help.

39:15.116 --> 39:16.717
How 'bout you find yourself
some other paralegal?

39:16.751 --> 39:19.921
Because as far as I'm concerned,
we're done.

39:29.564 --> 39:32.567
Uh, can you give us
a minute?

39:36.105 --> 39:38.873
Well, Jessica.

39:38.908 --> 39:42.411
I've spoken
to Alexandra Leeds.

39:42.445 --> 39:44.346
She told me
about the deal you cut.

39:44.380 --> 39:48.216
What do you want me
to say?

39:48.251 --> 39:49.985
Hmm.

39:50.019 --> 39:52.988
This is a copy.

39:53.022 --> 39:55.390
I'm driving over
to the Attorney General's office

39:55.425 --> 39:57.059
right now.

39:57.093 --> 39:58.961
If she doesn't tell me
you've cut a new deal

39:58.995 --> 40:00.529
by the time I get there,

40:00.563 --> 40:03.598
she gets the original.

40:03.633 --> 40:07.401
And then I give her
the proof.

40:07.436 --> 40:09.604
You don't have the proof.

40:09.638 --> 40:14.374
Don't I?

40:14.409 --> 40:17.211
Cut a new deal.

40:17.245 --> 40:19.914
And if you ever mess
with one of mine again,

40:19.948 --> 40:23.384
Alexandra gets that anyway.

40:38.700 --> 40:42.136
You don't have to testify.

40:42.170 --> 40:44.971
They don't need you anymore.

40:45.006 --> 40:47.007
Cameron made a deal?

40:47.041 --> 40:50.410
He made a deal
to sell you out.

40:50.444 --> 40:52.512
But I made my own deal.

40:52.547 --> 40:53.914
He'll be stepping down,

40:53.948 --> 40:57.017
spending some quality time
with his family.

40:57.051 --> 40:58.452
How exactly
did you manage that?

40:58.486 --> 41:00.020
Not your concern.

41:00.054 --> 41:02.823
But you're
in the clear, Harvey.

41:05.393 --> 41:07.327
Some people would be happy
with that news.

41:07.361 --> 41:10.296
That son of a bitch.

41:10.331 --> 41:12.832
Clifford Danner was 18.

41:12.866 --> 41:14.200
I put him in jail
12 years ago.

41:14.234 --> 41:18.437
Kid's been rotting in prison
his whole adult life.

41:18.472 --> 41:21.274
And?

41:21.308 --> 41:24.376
He's innocent.

41:24.411 --> 41:26.011
Cameron buried the evidence.

41:26.046 --> 41:27.847
If I'd had it...

41:27.881 --> 41:30.049
Do you have enough
to overturn?

41:30.083 --> 41:33.085
I don't know.

41:38.025 --> 41:41.027
So what are you going to do?

41:43.731 --> 41:45.699
I'm gonna get him out.
