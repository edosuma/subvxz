He was mugged last

that Paddy ordered the hits?

02:25.701 --> 02:26.935
RICO case is all about proving

that Paddy was the head
of a crime syndicate,

and he didn't have to
pull the trigger himself.

02:31.306 --> 02:32.840
With Donovan's testimony,

the government can prove
Paddy was behind 15 murders.

02:35.510 --> 02:38.646
- So, why's the book so important?
- It corroborates his story.

Lieutenant to keep that quiet

need him for our RICO case.

but when I was growing up,

moving cocaine through Southie,

08:02.111 --> 08:03.311
he reached out to me.

08:03.345 --> 08:05.480
He wanted the drugs out of
the neighborhood, same as me.

08:05.514 --> 08:08.216
You're not getting sentimental
on me, are you, Lieutenant?

08:08.251 --> 08:11.319
He did one good thing.
He's still a bad guy.

08:11.353 --> 08:14.489
- I can't wait for this to be over.
- Yeah, me, too.

08:14.557 --> 08:18.626

working drugs with him,

08:49.123 --> 08:50.556
I think about Linda and his son.

- Doesn't he have a daughter, too?
- They're not close.

12:23.872 --> 12:26.340
<i>Okay, we're off to a good start.</i>

12:26.408 --> 12:28.376
- Thank you, both.
- Okay.

12:28.410 --> 12:30.444
What? What is it?

12:30.512 --> 12:32.279
Your phones were off.
Jackie Donovan is dead.

12:32.347 --> 12:33.514
What?!

12:33.548 --> 12:35.583
U.S. Marshals' car he was
in was T-boned by a semi

12:35.617 --> 12:37.818
on Congress and Atlantic
Avenue about 10 minutes ago.

12:37.852 --> 12:39.253
That's just around the corner.

12:39.287 --> 12:40.354
<i>Jackie Donovan's dead.</i>

12:40.388 --> 12:42.756
- Paddy got to him.
- Korsak: It looks like it.

12:42.790 --> 12:44.291
Two U.S. Marshals are dead, too.

12:44.325 --> 12:50.197
- So, what does this mean for the trial?
- It means Paddy won the first round.

12:50.231 --> 12:52.632
It is obvious that this
is no accident, your honor.

12:52.700 --> 12:55.368
Five minutes before our key
witness is supposed to testify

12:55.402 --> 12:57.136
and half a block away
from your courtroom,

12:57.171 --> 12:59.705
he is killed by
teamsters driving a truck?

12:59.740 --> 13:01.373
I think we all know who's behind this.

13:01.408 --> 13:02.641
<i>Walsh: Your honor, there's no evidence</i>

13:02.676 --> 13:04.977
that this is anything more
than a tragic accident.

13:05.011 --> 13:06.445
<i>"Tragic accident."</i>

13:06.479 --> 13:07.946
The government asks
for two days to regroup.

13:07.981 --> 13:10.682
<i>Two-day delay? Does counsel
think he can resurrect a dead man?</i>

13:10.717 --> 13:12.885
As tragic as this is,

13:12.919 --> 13:14.720
let me remind you this
trial has already started.

13:14.755 --> 13:17.190
Call your next witness.

13:17.224 --> 13:19.459
Your honor, the prosecution
had anticipated...

13:19.493 --> 13:20.794
Why can't he call his next witness?

13:20.828 --> 13:22.262
<i>Jane: He doesn't have
another witness ready,</i>

13:22.329 --> 13:24.397
and he certainly doesn't
have another Jackie Donovan.

13:24.432 --> 13:26.966
Your honor, my client has
been in jail for over a year.

13:27.001 --> 13:30.236
The entirety of the government's case
seems to rest on a now dead witness.

13:30.270 --> 13:34.440
We just need a continuance, your honor.
We'll be ready in 48 hours.

13:34.475 --> 13:37.511
At the very least, my client
should be considered for bail.

13:37.545 --> 13:40.413
- Bail?
- They'll never do that.

13:42.483 --> 13:45.086
<i>Female reporter: And in a twist
legal pundits will be</i>

13:45.087 --> 13:48.055
<i>talking about for years,
the judge granted bail for</i>

13:48.056 --> 13:51.024
the alleged head of the Southie
crime family, Paddy Doyle.

13:51.092 --> 13:52.326
<i>The federal government</i>

13:52.360 --> 13:54.928
<i>has been skating on
thin ice for a long time,</i>

13:54.962 --> 13:57.308
<i>and today, they fell in.
Thank you.</i>

13:58.032 --> 14:01.134
<i>Clearly, the judge was stuck
between a rock and a hard place.</i>

14:01.168 --> 14:02.702
<i>The prosecution wasn't
ready to proceed...</i>

14:02.770 --> 14:05.505
- I don't believe this.
- Why are they shaking his hand?

14:05.540 --> 14:07.874
They're from Southie ... if Paddy's
out, you want to be on his good side.

14:07.908 --> 14:11.979
<i>...the judge had no choice
but to reconsider the issue of bail.</i>

14:12.047 --> 14:13.414
He can't get away with this.

14:13.448 --> 14:17.151
I would've said that yesterday.
I don't know about today.

14:23.996 --> 14:28.399
- Did you get him to talk?
- Oh, yeah. Can't get him to stop.

14:28.434 --> 14:32.270
He said my father hired
a couple of teamsters

14:32.305 --> 14:34.273
to run their truck
into the Marshals' van.

14:34.307 --> 14:37.310
Said it was pretty quick,
except for the one who bled out

14:37.311 --> 14:38.845
before the ambulance arrived.

14:38.879 --> 14:42.315
Poor guys ... just doing their jobs.

14:42.349 --> 14:45.752
And how are we supposed to do ours?

14:45.787 --> 14:48.588
I mean, he's out, Jane.
How did this happen?

14:48.656 --> 14:51.158
How? We'll, he's always
eight chess moves ahead.

14:51.225 --> 14:53.460
Where do you think you
got your I.Q. points?

14:53.494 --> 14:57.097
- Don't remind me.
- He'll only be out for a couple of days,

14:57.131 --> 14:58.965
and they got him wearing
the ankle bracelet.

14:58.999 --> 15:00.900
I'm sure the feds are
watching his every move.

15:00.934 --> 15:02.201
We may have something.

15:03.137 --> 15:05.705
Well, that's good news.
Shouldn't we go up to the squad room?

15:05.739 --> 15:07.940
- We can't, Jane.
- Why not?

15:07.975 --> 15:09.576
Cavanaugh can't know about this.

15:12.446 --> 15:15.415
Calvin Ghetts investigated the
fire that killed his family.

15:15.449 --> 15:17.117
What does Cal have to
do with Paddy Doyle?

15:17.184 --> 15:20.720
We were about to make a deal with
Ghetts to testify against him.

15:20.755 --> 15:23.290
- Cal was dirty?
- [ sighing ] Oh, my god.

15:23.324 --> 15:24.858
Wait a minute. 
Did Paddy send someone

15:24.893 --> 15:26.927
to Atlantic City to take
him out before he could talk?

15:26.962 --> 15:29.863
- We think so.
- The FBI thinks Paddy paid Ghetts

15:29.898 --> 15:33.066
to burn down buildings in the '90s,
falsify arson reports

15:33.101 --> 15:35.502
so Paddy could buy condemned
property for a song.

15:35.536 --> 15:37.103
But you could never prove that.

15:37.138 --> 15:39.472
No, not until Calvin Ghetts
told me in a phone call

15:39.507 --> 15:41.341
before he died that
he had saved evidence

15:41.375 --> 15:43.476
that could prove that
Paddy was behind that fire.

15:43.511 --> 15:47.514
Cal set the fire...
and you were granting him immunity

15:47.548 --> 15:50.283
in exchange for the
evidence in his testimony.

15:50.318 --> 15:51.952
- Right.  - Maura: You were
gonna make a deal with a man

15:51.986 --> 15:54.387
who killed a police
officer's wife and baby?

15:54.455 --> 15:56.155
Maura, sometimes you got
to dance with the devil

15:56.190 --> 15:58.858
to get a conviction ...
especially for two capital murders.

15:58.892 --> 16:01.660
So you're gonna seek the death penalty.

16:01.695 --> 16:05.697
If you're conflicted, Doctor, I won't
ask you to help investigate this.

16:05.732 --> 16:09.500
I'm a physician, Mr. King.
I don't wish death on anyone!

16:09.535 --> 16:13.004
- That doesn't mean I won't help you.
- Wait a minute. Help you with what?

16:13.038 --> 16:14.438
You don't have a case
without Cal Ghetts.

16:14.473 --> 16:16.807
I don't have any more time.
I need you to find that evidence.

16:16.842 --> 16:19.877
- What are we looking for?
- I don't know.

16:19.912 --> 16:21.879
All right? All we have
are Cal's arson files.

16:21.913 --> 16:23.380
Maybe there's something there.

16:23.415 --> 16:25.967
Yeah, but what? You
had 20 years and your

16:25.968 --> 16:28.519
own task force to make
an arson connection

16:28.553 --> 16:29.787
between Cal Ghetts and Paddy Doyle.

16:29.822 --> 16:31.623
Now you want us to find
something in 36 hours?

16:31.657 --> 16:33.991
I'm not gonna lie to you...
 it's a Hail Mary pass.

16:34.026 --> 16:36.427
Well, you better Hope we can catch.

16:37.696 --> 16:39.297
[ sighs ]

16:48.523 --> 16:49.790
<i>Korsak: These are the last two.</i>

16:49.824 --> 16:52.659
I don't think they'll be any help.
They're from 2004.

16:52.727 --> 16:53.994
We've been through everything from 1993.

16:54.028 --> 16:56.396
His file on Cavanaugh's
apartment fire isn't in here.

16:56.464 --> 16:59.299
I keep telling 'em it's
time to scan everything.

16:59.334 --> 17:01.101
Did anyone talk to Cal's wife yet?

17:01.135 --> 17:03.503
- No.
- Oh, man, I really should

17:03.504 --> 17:05.137
go over there
and give her my condolences.

17:05.173 --> 17:07.307
- Hey, Frost, go now.
- Well, it's late.

17:07.340 --> 17:10.242
No, but we're running out of time, and
Cal might have kept the file at home.

17:10.277 --> 17:11.511
Well, you better come with me.

17:11.546 --> 17:14.481
It'd be good to have a woman there ...
make her feel more comfortable.

17:14.515 --> 17:17.717
Well, I want to go through '92 and
'94. The case might be misfiled.

17:17.752 --> 17:20.720
- I can go.
- But you're not a Detective.

17:20.788 --> 17:22.488
Well, I'm a woman who makes
people feel comfortable,

17:22.522 --> 17:23.790
and you're busy, Jane.

17:23.824 --> 17:26.559
We'll say we're there to
bring her the collection money.

17:26.627 --> 17:30.896
- We've got a lot to do here, Jane.
- Okay. Okay, yeah, yeah, do it.

17:31.531 --> 17:33.065
<i>[ knock on door ]</i>

17:36.769 --> 17:40.438
- Do you know what time it is?
- Miss Ghetts?

17:40.473 --> 17:43.875
- Barold?
- I'm sorry to bother you.

17:43.909 --> 17:48.646
I just wanted to come by and say...

17:48.680 --> 17:52.644
I'm very sorry for you loss.
Detective Ghetts was a good man.

17:53.218 --> 17:54.318
[ sighs ]

17:54.352 --> 17:58.322
This is from everyone at the station.

17:58.357 --> 18:01.960
Thank you. That's very kind.

18:01.994 --> 18:04.696
This is my colleague, Dr. Isles.

18:04.730 --> 18:06.665
<i>Maura: We're all very
sorry for your loss.</i>

18:06.699 --> 18:08.967
We know how difficult it must be.

18:14.208 --> 18:18.011
Miss Ghetts, we were closing
some of Cal's open arson cases,

18:18.046 --> 18:20.414
and we haven't been able
to find some of his files.

18:20.448 --> 18:23.351
We were wondering if perhaps
he brought his work home.

18:23.385 --> 18:29.023
He kept his files in the garage, yes,
but it got broken into when we were...

18:29.058 --> 18:35.463
- when we were in Atlantic City.
- I know this is an imposition,

18:35.497 --> 18:38.366
but would it be possible for
you to show us the garage?

18:38.400 --> 18:44.072
It's just Cal's junk and old files.
They really tore the place apart.

18:44.139 --> 18:46.808
Too bad they didn't
take that hunk of junk.

18:48.611 --> 18:53.581
Calvin said this was our
big retirement nest egg.

18:53.648 --> 18:55.716
"Shirley, no matter what happens,

18:55.750 --> 18:58.018
don't you ever sell the Granada."

18:58.052 --> 19:02.689
- You wouldn't get more than $500 for it.
- Oh, you might get more than that.

19:02.723 --> 19:05.391
No, she's right. I looked
it up on "car buyers."

19:05.425 --> 19:07.560
But your husband said
it was your "nest egg"?

19:07.594 --> 19:11.297
Every time we had a cash-flow issue

19:11.365 --> 19:14.901
[voice breaking]
he'd tell me... not to worry.

19:14.936 --> 19:19.439
<i>"It's all right here, honey."</i>

19:19.473 --> 19:23.989
[ sighs ] I'm sorry.
This is just too hard right now.

19:25.179 --> 19:26.913
<i>Excuse me.</i>

19:31.652 --> 19:35.555
- Paddy's guys tore this place apart.
- But they left the car.

19:35.590 --> 19:38.459
Can you check in the glove compartment?

19:38.493 --> 19:40.094
Sure.

19:44.132 --> 19:46.034
Nothing in the trunk.

19:46.102 --> 19:49.071
Yeah, nothing in the glove
compartment or inside the car.

19:49.105 --> 19:52.441
If old Cal hid something in the car,
Paddy's guys would have found it.

19:52.508 --> 19:54.509
Yeah, but this car hasn't
been moved in years.

19:54.544 --> 19:56.278
And there's plenty of
places to hide things,

19:56.312 --> 19:58.246
especially if the car
doesn't need to be driven.

19:58.281 --> 19:59.748
I'm thinking like a drug dealer.

19:59.816 --> 20:02.451
Well, don't you think Paddy's
guys think like drug dealers?

20:02.485 --> 20:04.954
It's worth a try.

20:04.988 --> 20:07.156
Uh, I'll get a search warrant
going. [ cellphone vibrates ]

20:07.190 --> 20:09.358
We'll take all this and we'll do
what Paddy's guys couldn't do ...

20:09.392 --> 20:11.193
pull this car apart.

20:11.228 --> 20:14.664
It's Jane. She wants to
know if we have anything.

20:14.698 --> 20:18.568
Not until we have the search warrant.
Go get some food. I'll stay here.

20:18.636 --> 20:21.204
- You sure?
- Yeah, yeah, I already ate.

20:21.239 --> 20:23.773
I am craving a Tempeh bacon burger.

20:24.008 --> 20:28.211
Make sure Jane eats something, too.
You know she forgets sometimes.

20:32.550 --> 20:36.487
<i>- Jane: I feel guilty.
- Maura: You have to eat. We'll get it to go.</i>

20:36.554 --> 20:39.056
[ laughter, indistinct conversations ]

20:39.124 --> 20:40.291
<i>Man: To Paddy!</i>

20:42.695 --> 20:45.697
Look at him ... he thinks he's
already gotten away with it.

20:45.731 --> 20:48.133
He's killed four people
in the last two days.

20:48.167 --> 20:50.502
Let's go, Maura.

20:50.537 --> 20:53.772
You know, they've even
changed the menu for him.

20:53.807 --> 20:56.041
They're serving him
beef with French fries.

20:56.109 --> 20:57.876
Maybe it's locally sourced.

20:57.944 --> 21:00.246
Let's go. 
This is not helping anything.

21:00.313 --> 21:01.880
<i>Paddy: Maura.</i>

21:06.354 --> 21:10.757
Three more men are lying on my
autopsy tables because of you.

21:10.791 --> 21:13.326
Maura, I had nothing
to do with that crash.

21:17.532 --> 21:19.600
I wish Jane had killed you.

21:27.009 --> 21:29.744
<i>[ doorbell rings ]</i>

21:30.479 --> 21:34.349
- Hi. How is she?
- Not good.

21:34.384 --> 21:36.919
Does she know I'm here?

21:36.954 --> 21:39.255
She asked me to call you.

21:44.061 --> 21:45.295
- Hey, Maura?
- Mm-hmm.

21:45.329 --> 21:47.597
- Hope's here.
- Just in the middle

21:47.665 --> 21:51.234
of getting the pills out
of my cashmere blends.

21:52.970 --> 21:55.739
Maura...

21:58.208 --> 22:00.276
[ voice breaking ]
I told him I wished he was dead.

22:02.847 --> 22:04.013
[ sniffles ]

22:04.048 --> 22:08.517
No, I ... I don't really like
to be hugged when I'm very upset.

22:12.956 --> 22:15.157
Got to get these sheath
dresses off the floor

22:15.191 --> 22:17.159
before they wrinkle.

22:17.193 --> 22:20.763
[ sighs heavily ]

22:20.797 --> 22:25.001
Yes, it is strange getting
to know her as an adult.

22:25.035 --> 22:28.705
- I can't even imagine.
- Every year on her birthday,

22:28.706 --> 22:31.608
I would come to Boston,
and I'd visit her grave.

22:31.642 --> 22:35.779
And I would add up the years,
and I would think about...

22:35.813 --> 22:40.751
how old she'd be and
 wonder what she'd turn out to be.

22:40.785 --> 22:44.221
Well, is she anything like you imagined?

22:44.255 --> 22:45.489
She's better.

22:45.523 --> 22:50.761
She's so much better than I imagined,
and I have a good imagination.

22:55.568 --> 22:58.604
Maura: I'm so sorry.
I should have offered you some tea.

22:58.638 --> 23:02.842
- And girl scout cookies.
- I ate them all.

23:02.876 --> 23:03.976
Even the thin mints?

23:04.011 --> 23:06.146
- I ate those first.
- Damn.

23:06.180 --> 23:09.316
I know this is your house,
but could I make you some tea?

23:09.383 --> 23:11.985
I would like that.

23:13.688 --> 23:17.491
Sometimes...
the only way for me turn off

23:17.525 --> 23:19.293
the panicky thoughts in my head at night

23:19.327 --> 23:22.463
is the thought of
espresso in the morning.

23:22.530 --> 23:24.865
Me too.

Oh, no, that'll keep me up all night.

Thank you.

She's okay.
She'd be a lot better

24:26.566 --> 24:28.300
if we could find
something in Cal's Granada.

24:28.368 --> 24:30.603
Any news on the car?

24:30.637 --> 24:33.206
CSRU took apart the doors,
the engine, the dashboard.

24:33.240 --> 24:36.076
- Nothing so far.
- Where else would Cal hide that file?

24:36.110 --> 24:39.346
Maybe we don't have to find the file.

24:39.380 --> 24:41.849
If Cal set the fire, Paddy
would've paid him to do it.

24:41.916 --> 24:43.917
Which means Paddy would have kept
a record of it in his little book.

24:43.951 --> 24:47.020
Yeah. Here.
Here, everybody take a section.

24:49.023 --> 24:50.390
Paddy wrote everything in code.

24:50.425 --> 24:55.496
- "Big head rent lo broad"?
- "Big head" meant Michael Wynne.

24:55.530 --> 24:58.232
"Rent" meant shaking down
store owners on "lo broad,"

24:58.266 --> 25:00.835
which is the lower end of West Broadway.

25:00.869 --> 25:03.137
How do I explain my presence if
Lieutenant Cavanaugh comes in?

25:03.172 --> 25:05.473
Tell him you have menstrual cramps.

<i>We got to find a connection

25:36.138 --> 25:38.806

- He said it's too bad Cal's dead.

25:38.841 --> 25:40.675
He'd like to wrap his
hands around his throat.

25:41.510 --> 25:44.813
- Frost, what are you doing?
- Trying to break Paddy's codes.

25:44.848 --> 25:46.548
He's got these charts starting in 1992.

25:46.616 --> 25:49.919
- Show me where that is.
- It's right here in Paddy's book.

25:56.293 --> 25:59.462
- Oh, my god.
- Whoa, what's wrong?

25:59.497 --> 26:02.566
How could we not know?
Paddy and Oso ... that's it.

26:02.600 --> 26:04.368
- Who's Oso?
- Oso Garcia ...

26:04.402 --> 26:07.137
he was a Colombian drug dealer
that Cavanaugh shut down in '92.

26:07.171 --> 26:09.572
When Paddy was Cavanaugh's C.I.?

26:09.640 --> 26:11.841
- Yeah.
- '92? That doesn't make any sense.

26:11.876 --> 26:14.210
Yeah, why would Paddy
buy cocaine from Oso,

26:14.245 --> 26:16.246
then turn around and
help Cavanaugh bust him?

26:16.280 --> 26:18.849
- Oh, my god.
- What is it?

26:18.883 --> 26:21.885
It was a setup
 from the beginning to the end.

26:21.920 --> 26:24.855
All Paddy wanted was cheaper cocaine,

26:24.889 --> 26:27.491
and he fed Cavanaugh information

26:27.525 --> 26:29.826
knowing that it would chase
the Colombians out of Southie.

26:29.861 --> 26:31.295
Paddy ran Southie.

26:31.329 --> 26:32.963
Eventually, the Colombians
would have to go to him for help.

26:32.998 --> 26:35.132
They didn't know Paddy
was the informant.

26:35.166 --> 26:38.002
- I'm not following this.
- Paddy helped the drug unit

26:38.003 --> 26:41.837
bring heat onto Oso
from August of '92 to March of '93.

26:41.872 --> 26:45.174
Oh, so all these zeroes mean
Paddy couldn't buy cocaine.

26:45.209 --> 26:47.510
Because Cavanaugh was putting
pressure on the Colombians.

26:47.545 --> 26:50.246
Right, but in April of '93,

26:50.281 --> 26:52.815
Paddy started buying cocaine
again but for half the price.

26:52.850 --> 26:57.220
- So what changed in March of '93?
- His family died.

26:57.254 --> 27:00.356
Linda and Christopher Cavanaugh
died in the fire at the end of March.

27:00.391 --> 27:02.525
My guess is, Paddy's plan
was to kill Cavanaugh,

27:02.560 --> 27:04.494
but it worked out the same
when Cal set that fire,

27:04.529 --> 27:07.397
- only his wife and son died instead.
- 'Cause Cavanaugh fell apart...

He never ran another drug case.

Mm, maybe CSRU missed something.

This looks promising.

Clever.

31:59.720 --> 32:02.388
It looks like two pieces
of pipe and a union joint.

32:02.422 --> 32:07.427
- That's a gas valve.
- It looks like we found Cal's evidence.

32:07.461 --> 32:10.163
It's a lot better than a missing file.

32:10.198 --> 32:12.232
And these might be
pieces from the furnace

32:42.863 --> 32:44.898
His father's an admiral, not a plumber.

32:44.932 --> 32:46.500
Well, did he say that he
found anything else in the car?

32:46.534 --> 32:49.135
He said he thought that the
exhaust system had been welded shut.

32:49.170 --> 32:51.805
This is the gas valve
from the exploded furnace.

32:51.839 --> 32:54.974
If it had malfunctioned, there would be
evidence of charring, there isn't any.

32:55.008 --> 32:58.411
So the gas valve wasn't the cause of
the fire, like Cal originally claimed.

32:58.445 --> 32:59.979
- No.
- And it wasn't the union joint.

33:00.013 --> 33:02.448
No, there's no damage on the threads.

33:02.482 --> 33:04.149
Which means it was loosened on purpose,

33:04.217 --> 33:06.318
which supports the theory
that Cal set the fire.

33:06.352 --> 33:08.086
He probably went into
Cavanaugh's apartment,

33:08.120 --> 33:09.787
turned off the heat, then
went down into the basement

33:09.822 --> 33:10.855
and loosened the union joint.

33:10.890 --> 33:12.323
Natural gas from these pipes

33:21.234 --> 33:22.768

34:52.558 --> 34:54.292
<i>Jane: You know, every time
Paddy wanted something done,</i>

34:54.327 --> 34:57.362
one of these guys did it,
but this time was different.

34:57.396 --> 34:58.763
What do you mean?

34:58.831 --> 35:02.200
RICO ... Paddy's not gonna send
one of his guys to kill a cop's family.

35:02.234 --> 35:04.202
<i>I got it ... March 23, 1993.</i>

35:04.236 --> 35:06.204
- He's gonna do it himself.
- Korsak: Of course.

35:06.239 --> 35:09.622
Penalty's the same for capital murder.
Do it yourself, no one can turn on you.

35:10.075 --> 35:14.379
Detective Frost, can you blow
up the area around his collar?

35:14.414 --> 35:17.749
Maura, we knew Paddy was behind
Linda and Christopher's murders.

35:17.783 --> 35:19.784
That fact that he set the fire himself

35:19.852 --> 35:21.886
isn't any worse than ordering
someone else to do it.

35:21.921 --> 35:23.054
What is it?

35:23.089 --> 35:25.557
Hemostatic trauma gauze.

35:28.327 --> 35:30.027
I think she helped him.

35:34.333 --> 35:37.102
[ door opens ]

35:40.540 --> 35:44.609
Maura, he's fine.
His vitals are stable.

35:44.644 --> 35:45.644
What's wrong?

35:48.648 --> 35:52.217
That's your work, isn't it?

35:52.251 --> 35:55.387
Did Paddy tell you
how he got those burns?

35:55.421 --> 35:56.889
No.

35:58.425 --> 36:00.126
You see the man on the couch?

36:02.496 --> 36:04.296
20 years ago,

36:04.331 --> 36:10.970
Paddy killed his 25-year-old
wife and their 2-year-old son.

36:11.037 --> 36:14.807
They burned to death after
he blew up their apartment,

36:14.875 --> 36:19.612
and you ... you treated
his burns, didn't you?

36:19.646 --> 36:21.146
I didn't know.

36:21.181 --> 36:24.617
I swear to you I did not
know how he got those burns.

36:24.651 --> 36:25.851
But you must have heard.

36:25.886 --> 36:28.621
You must have heard that
a cop's family died in a fire,

36:28.655 --> 36:31.090
and then Paddy shows up with
third-degree burns and ...

36:31.158 --> 36:34.861
Come on! What lie did you
tell yourself that day?!

36:34.895 --> 36:37.196
He swore that he would never
hurt women and children,

36:37.231 --> 36:40.133
so that ... it must
have been an accident.

36:40.167 --> 36:45.304
No, it wasn't an accident.
There are no more accidents, Hope.

36:45.339 --> 36:49.042
You made a bargain with the
devil, and it has come due.

36:50.076 --> 36:54.381
- What do you mean?
- You're going to testify against him.

37:04.069 --> 37:06.136
<i>I am beyond impressed that you caught </i>

37:06.170 --> 37:09.139
the wildest Hail Mary pass that I
ever had to throw. Thank you both.

37:09.173 --> 37:12.108
Well, it's not over yet.
Hope Martin still has to testify.

37:12.142 --> 37:13.309
What if she doesn't?

37:13.343 --> 37:16.445
Well, that's why I sent two cops
to escort her. She'll be here.

37:16.479 --> 37:18.781
I'll talk to the judge.
We'll get in front of the grand jury,

37:18.815 --> 37:20.516
and we'll have two murder
indictments by lunch.

37:20.550 --> 37:23.118
I think you better
wish me luck this time.

37:23.153 --> 37:25.220
Don't screw it up, counselor.

37:25.288 --> 37:26.188
[ chuckles ]

37:26.222 --> 37:29.091
- You okay?
- You know when I said

37:29.092 --> 37:31.760
she should've picked someone
else to sleep with 37 years ago?

37:31.794 --> 37:32.961
[ chuckling ] Yeah.

37:33.029 --> 37:34.596
Maybe Paddy should've
picked somebody else.

37:34.630 --> 37:37.332
Well, she said she'd
testify against him, right?

37:37.366 --> 37:39.134
Yes.

37:39.168 --> 37:42.036
Well, maybe, you know, in her own
way, she's trying to make amends.

37:42.071 --> 37:44.639
- Here we go.
- Now go get 'em.

37:44.673 --> 37:47.376
<i>How you doing, Jenkins?
You got a lot of evidence today.</i>

37:47.410 --> 37:49.144
<i>Got a gun case on the third floor.</i>

37:49.178 --> 37:50.846
<i>- Good luck with that, okay?
- Thanks.</i>

37:50.880 --> 37:52.514
Cavanaugh should be here.

37:52.582 --> 37:55.217
Lieutenant Cavanaugh?
He's already upstairs.

37:55.252 --> 37:56.819
He's what?

37:56.853 --> 37:59.121
Jane, he's not gonna strangle
Paddy in the court house.

37:59.189 --> 38:00.255
He can't get his
weapon through security.

38:00.290 --> 38:02.024
Yes, he can.

38:04.761 --> 38:06.529
[ grunts ]

38:07.631 --> 38:09.432
Look at me, you son of a bitch.

38:09.466 --> 38:13.836
Blowin' your head off would be too good.
I'm gonna kill you slowly.

38:13.870 --> 38:16.005
It wasn't personal, Sean.
It was just business.

38:16.039 --> 38:20.209
Business?
You killed my wife and my baby son

38:20.243 --> 38:23.346
so you could get your cocaine cheaper?!

38:23.380 --> 38:26.182
How do you stand there and
think you deserve another breath?

38:26.250 --> 38:28.151
[ grunts ]

38:30.488 --> 38:33.223
- Korsak: Sean, don't!
- Lieutenant, please don't do this.

38:33.258 --> 38:35.926
Don't.
I want to talk to my father.

38:35.961 --> 38:37.795
Don't come any closer,
Dr. Isles. He's a dead man.

38:37.829 --> 38:38.896
Maura: All right, but
before you kill him,

38:38.931 --> 38:40.231
I just want him to know something.

38:40.298 --> 38:44.368
She's here, Paddy ... Hope.

38:44.403 --> 38:46.037
Hope is here?

38:46.071 --> 38:48.539
She was about to testify
to the grand jury.

38:48.574 --> 38:50.741
[ chuckles lightly ]
That'll never happen.

38:50.776 --> 38:51.976
Now it won't because

38:51.977 --> 38:55.145
the Lieutenant is gonna
save us all a lot of anguish,

38:55.180 --> 38:59.617
but it must feel terrible
to hear that the love of your life

38:59.685 --> 39:01.886
was about to help us
put you on death row.

39:01.920 --> 39:04.355
- She wouldn't.
- Oh, but she would.

39:04.423 --> 39:06.924
All these years, you've
stayed alive for two things ...

39:06.992 --> 39:11.395
[voice breaking] 
power and Hope.

39:11.430 --> 39:15.099
<i>Seems fitting you'd go out like this.</i>

39:15.134 --> 39:19.370
You're lying.
Hope would never do that.

39:26.112 --> 39:29.114
<i>Cavanaugh: I've got a better
way for you to experience hell.</i>

39:30.617 --> 39:34.420
You're gonna stay alive,
but without her.

39:38.125 --> 39:43.296
- Come on, Sean.
- Give me minute, Vince.

39:54.759 --> 39:57.008
[ music ]

40:38.118 --> 40:41.488
[ sobs ]

40:45.927 --> 40:49.062
You know, 
I never thought I'd say this,

40:49.097 --> 40:50.998
but these sweet-potato
fries are growing on me.

40:51.032 --> 40:54.902
- Try them with a fresh mint.
- Don't push your luck.

40:54.936 --> 40:57.104
Speaking of luck-pushing,

40:57.139 --> 40:59.407
he totally could have
pulled that trigger.

40:59.441 --> 41:03.111
- No, he wasn't going to.
- [ scoffs ] You don't know that.

41:03.146 --> 41:05.161
- Yes, I do.
- Oh, really? 

41:05.196 --> 41:07.083
<i>Oh, okay, show me that study.</i>

41:07.117 --> 41:11.320
Cite statistics with your
double-blind control group.

41:12.656 --> 41:14.457
What are you doing?

41:14.491 --> 41:17.527
Looking up the peer-reviewed
studies on violence in men's rooms.

41:17.562 --> 41:19.896
You're so full of crap.

41:21.599 --> 41:23.233
You're shoe shopping, Mau...
Stop eating my fries.

41:23.267 --> 41:25.669
- Give me my tablet.
- No.

41:25.737 --> 41:28.038
Order dessert, and I'll think about it.

41:28.106 --> 41:31.242
Mmm, these are really
good with the fresh mint.

41:31.276 --> 41:33.644
[ scoffs ]
Enough with the plants already.

41:33.678 --> 41:36.180
[ both chuckle ]
