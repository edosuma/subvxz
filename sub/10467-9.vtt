WEBVTT

00:02.611 --> 00:04.178
MM.

00:04.178 --> 00:06.702
OH, THANK GOD
YOU BROUGHT FOOD.

00:06.702 --> 00:09.487
BARELY ENOUGH TO FEED
THIS HOUSE ANYMORE.

00:09.487 --> 00:10.836
WHERE'S DAPHNE?

00:10.836 --> 00:12.273
SHE'S IN
THE LIVING ROOM.

00:12.273 --> 00:14.318
SHE'S KIND OF A...MESS.

00:14.318 --> 00:15.972
IS DIANA SLEEPING?

00:15.972 --> 00:18.235
I JUST PUT HER DOWN,
AND SHE'S TAKING A NAP,

00:18.235 --> 00:20.455
BUT, UH, CHARLIE,

00:20.455 --> 00:22.065
SHOULD I SERVE DINNER?
'CAUSE THERE'S A LOT

00:22.065 --> 00:23.893
OF HUNGRY PEOPLE
AROUND HERE
ALL OF A SUDDEN.

00:23.893 --> 00:27.940
CLAUD, IT'S
NOT GOING TO WORK, OK?

00:27.940 --> 00:29.899
NO AMOUNT OF
GOOD DEEDS IS GOING
TO FIX WHAT YOU DID.

00:29.899 --> 00:31.727
NO, CHARLIE,
THAT'S NOT WHAT--

00:31.727 --> 00:33.381
IF YOU WANT TO MAKE IT RIGHT,
YOU SHOULD GET ON THE PHONE

00:33.381 --> 00:34.817
AND CALL HANOVER AND BEG THEM

00:34.817 --> 00:36.036
TO TAKE YOU BACK
AFTER CHRISTMAS.

00:36.036 --> 00:38.255
FORGET IT, CHARLIE.

00:38.255 --> 00:40.866
I'M NOT GOING
BACK THERE, SO...

00:40.866 --> 00:43.086
IF YOU WANT TO BE MAD
AT ME TILL THE MILLENNIUM,

00:43.086 --> 00:44.653
THAT'S FINE.

00:44.653 --> 00:46.394
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT,
A LOT OF PEOPLE?

00:46.394 --> 00:47.917
WE'RE NOT
A LOT OF PEOPLE.

00:55.751 --> 00:57.361
OH, YOU'RE HOME. UM--

00:57.361 --> 00:59.885
IT'S OK.
I--I GOT THE BABY.
JUST RELAX.

00:59.885 --> 01:02.758
GO OUT, DO WHATEVER
YOU WANT. I MEAN,

01:02.758 --> 01:04.977
IF YOU'RE NOT
UP TO IT,
YOU'RE NOT UP TO IT.

01:06.501 --> 01:08.677
THIS CAME OFF THE CHAIR
FROM YOUR ROOM.

01:08.677 --> 01:12.028
LES THOUGHT IT WAS
A RECLINER, SO WE...
FORCED IT A LITTLE.

01:12.028 --> 01:14.248
OH.CHAIRS OUGHT TO HAVE
A LABEL OR SOMETHING

01:14.248 --> 01:15.727
SO THIS DON'T HAPPEN
TO PEOPLE.

01:15.727 --> 01:18.730
MOM! YOU BETTER NOT
HAVE BEEN UNPACKING.

01:18.730 --> 01:20.167
I TOLD YOU
NOT TO UNPACK UNTIL
I TALKED TO CHARLIE.

01:20.167 --> 01:22.691
YOU'RE...YOU'RE
DAPHNE'S MOM?

01:22.691 --> 01:25.781
I'M--I'M
CHARLIE SALINGER.

01:25.781 --> 01:29.132
DOREEN JABLONSKY.
SUCH A PLEASURE.

01:29.132 --> 01:30.960
AND THIS IS
LESTER PERCH, MY...

01:30.960 --> 01:33.267
WELL,
MY VERY GOOD FRIEND.

01:33.267 --> 01:34.616
NICE TO MEET YOU.

01:34.616 --> 01:36.183
HOW ARE YOU?GOOD.

01:36.183 --> 01:37.662
IF I CAN JUST GET
THAT REMOTE THERE, LITTLE LADY.

01:37.662 --> 01:39.011
THANK YOU.

01:39.011 --> 01:41.144
THEY DON'T HAVE
TO STAY, YOU KNOW.

01:41.144 --> 01:42.754
WE DIDN'T INVITE THEM
OR ANYTHING.

01:42.754 --> 01:45.453
AS SOON AS I HEARD
THAT DIANA WAS BORN,

01:45.453 --> 01:47.107
I JUST--I JUST HAD
TO GET OVER HERE

01:47.107 --> 01:48.673
AND MEET MY LITTLE
GRANDCHILD.

01:48.673 --> 01:50.588
THEY JUST
SORT OF SHOWED UP
OUT OF NOWHERE.

01:50.588 --> 01:52.590
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
IT'S CHRISTMAS, DAPHNE,

01:52.590 --> 01:54.288
AND SHE'S YOUR MOTHER
AND YOUR FAMILY.

01:54.288 --> 01:56.116
OF COURSE THEY'LL STAY--FINE.

01:56.116 --> 01:58.205
THEN THEY CAN STAY
IN THE ATTIC
OR THE GARAGE.

01:58.205 --> 01:59.684
THEY'LL STAY
IN OUR ROOM.

01:59.684 --> 02:01.295
WE'LL--WE'LL
SLEEP WITH THE BABY.

02:01.295 --> 02:03.123
SUCH A GENTLEMAN.

02:03.123 --> 02:05.777
YOU KNOW WHAT?

02:05.777 --> 02:07.475
THIS IS THE WAY
IT SHOULD BE.

02:07.475 --> 02:08.519
THE HOLIDAYS.

02:08.519 --> 02:10.173
REALLY. GRANDPARENTS,

02:10.173 --> 02:12.175
GRANDKIDS, I MEAN,
A HOUSE FULL OF FAMILY...

02:12.175 --> 02:13.568
I MEAN...

02:13.568 --> 02:15.178
ISN'T THIS THE WAY
IT SHOULD BE?

02:54.870 --> 02:56.915
CHRISTMAS IS
10 DAYS, JULIA.

02:56.915 --> 02:58.743
10 DAYS.

02:58.743 --> 03:01.050
WOW.

03:01.050 --> 03:03.139
NED, BUT WE
CAN SEE EACH OTHER
OVER THE BREAK.

03:03.139 --> 03:05.707
THE DRIVE'S, WHAT,
ONLY 40, 50 MINUTES.

03:05.707 --> 03:07.796
YOU'RE GOING TO
WANT TO BE AT HOME

03:07.796 --> 03:10.668
WITH YOUR SISTER
AND THE BABY
AND EVERYONE.

03:10.668 --> 03:12.670
I MEAN, THE DORM,

03:12.670 --> 03:14.368
THEY'VE ALREADY
TURNED OFF THE HEAT.

03:14.368 --> 03:15.586
YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO WANT TO VISIT.

03:15.586 --> 03:17.022
WAIT.

03:17.022 --> 03:18.372
YOU MEAN HERE?
YOU'RE NOT GOING HOME?

03:18.372 --> 03:20.417
I THOUGHT YOU KNEW THAT.

03:20.417 --> 03:22.463
MY POLI SCI PAPER
WAS DUE, LIKE, YESTERDAY,

03:22.463 --> 03:24.291
AND IT'S 5 POINTS OFF
FOR EVERY DAY LATE.

03:24.291 --> 03:26.162
MAN...

03:26.162 --> 03:28.164
SO...

03:28.164 --> 03:29.992
ONCE I'VE MISSED CHRISTMAS,
I MIGHT AS WELL STAY

03:29.992 --> 03:31.994
AND START CRAMMING
FOR FINALS.

03:31.994 --> 03:33.735
NED, THAT'S
SO DEPRESSING.

03:35.215 --> 03:37.217
WELL...

03:37.217 --> 03:40.437
IT'S MAINLY
THAT I'M MISSING YOU
THAT BUMS ME.

03:40.437 --> 03:42.874
MM...

03:42.874 --> 03:45.355
OK, YOU KNOW WHAT?

03:45.355 --> 03:47.575
I DON'T CARE
IF IT BOTHERS YOU.
I AM CALLING YOU

03:47.575 --> 03:49.359
EVERY OTHER MINUTE,
DAY AND NIGHT,

03:49.359 --> 03:51.709
SO YOU BETTER NEVER
LEAVE THE PHONE.

03:53.058 --> 03:54.277
SURE.

03:54.277 --> 03:55.322
THAT'S GREAT.

03:55.322 --> 03:57.672
NEVER.

03:57.672 --> 04:00.849
OH, GOSH, GRANDMA
TO A GREAT BIG NEW FAMILY!

04:00.849 --> 04:03.112
WHAT A HOOT!
WHOO! [CLAPS]

04:03.112 --> 04:05.593
REMEMBER HOW YOU
USED TO LOVE THE ZOO?

04:05.593 --> 04:07.290
I HATED THE ZOO, MOM.

04:07.290 --> 04:09.423
I USED TO CRY
AND BEG YOU TO LEAVE.

04:09.423 --> 04:11.642
YOU KNOW,
LES IS A BIG SOFTIE.

04:11.642 --> 04:13.731
WHEREVER WE GO
ANYWHERE,

04:13.731 --> 04:16.212
FIRST THING HE WANTS
TO DO IS JUST FIND
THE BABOONS, YOU KNOW,

04:16.212 --> 04:17.953
AND THEN JUST
LAUGH WHILE THEY DO
THEIR BUSINESS.

04:17.953 --> 04:20.434
SHE'S NOT NEARLY
OLD ENOUGH TO GO
TO THE ZOO YET.

04:20.434 --> 04:21.957
SHE'S BARELY SEEING COLORS.

04:21.957 --> 04:24.220
WELL, WHAT
ABOUT THE SNAPS?

04:24.220 --> 04:26.309
NEXT YEAR'S CHRISTMAS CARD.

04:26.309 --> 04:28.746
BESIDES, I ALREADY
PROMISED LES.

04:30.705 --> 04:32.228
MOM!

04:32.228 --> 04:34.099
I TOLD YOU
A HUNDRED TIMES
NOT TO LIGHT UP

04:34.099 --> 04:36.667
IN FRONT OF THE BABY!

04:36.667 --> 04:38.321
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH ME?

04:38.321 --> 04:39.931
I FORGOT LES' FOAMER.

04:39.931 --> 04:42.543
I PROMISED HIM A GAME BEER
HALF A QUARTER AGO,

04:42.543 --> 04:44.806
AND HERE I AM,
BABBLING LIKE A MONKEY.

04:44.806 --> 04:46.721
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'LL GET IT.

04:46.721 --> 04:48.244
NO, NO, I CAN GET--

04:48.244 --> 04:49.637
NO, YOU TWO
STAY AND TALK.

04:49.637 --> 04:50.507
NO, YOU--I GOT IT.

04:53.815 --> 04:55.295
ISN'T HE NICE?

05:01.257 --> 05:03.215
LISTEN, CHARLIE,

05:03.215 --> 05:05.261
I KNOW YOU'RE
STILL PISSED ABOUT
THE CLAUDIA THING,

05:05.261 --> 05:07.307
AND I SORT OF
CAN'T HELP BUT HEAR
FROM THE SHED

05:07.307 --> 05:09.309
WHEN YOU GIVE HER
HELL.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.311
WELL, TRY,
'CAUSE IT'S REALLY
NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

05:11.311 --> 05:12.877
IF YOU'D HAVE
JUST HEARD

05:12.877 --> 05:14.749
WHAT IT WAS LIKE
FOR HER THERE, MAN,

05:14.749 --> 05:16.751
MAYBE YOU WOULD'VE--NO, I WOULDN'T.

05:16.751 --> 05:19.928
I WOULDN'T HAVE
JUST YANKED HER OUT

05:19.928 --> 05:21.669
WITHOUT TELLING ANYBODY.

05:21.669 --> 05:23.410
BECAUSE NOW
THE SCHOOL IS PISSED,

05:23.410 --> 05:25.020
AND THEY MIGHT NOT
RELEASE HER TRANSCRIPT,

05:25.020 --> 05:26.326
WHICH MEANS THAT SHE MIGHT
HAVE TO TAKE

05:26.326 --> 05:28.458
THE WHOLE YEAR
OVER AGAIN.

05:28.458 --> 05:30.721
REALLY?YEAH. REALLY.

05:32.723 --> 05:34.812
SO PLEASE DON'T TELL ME
WHEN I CAN OR CAN'T BE MAD

05:34.812 --> 05:36.945
OR HOW I SHOULD BE
TAKING CARE OF
MY LITTLE SISTER,

05:36.945 --> 05:38.250
'CAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT,
GRIFFIN?

05:38.250 --> 05:39.774
YOU SLEEP HERE,

05:39.774 --> 05:42.080
AND YOU GET YOUR MAIL HERE,

05:42.080 --> 05:44.779
BUT YOUR SHARING AN ADDRESS
DOESN'T MAKE YOU FAMILY.

05:50.175 --> 05:51.525
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

05:51.525 --> 05:53.353
OH, MAN, IT'S COLD
IN HERE!

05:53.353 --> 05:55.093
I THINK
IT'S ACTUALLY COLDER
THAN IT IS OUTSIDE.

05:55.093 --> 05:56.747
JULIA, I REALLY, UH,

05:56.747 --> 05:59.097
I--I CAN'T RIGHT NOW.

05:59.097 --> 06:01.535
IF I COULD
JUST TROUBLE YOU
FOR A KISS GOOD-BYE.

06:01.535 --> 06:03.798
I'M IN THE MIDDLE
OF SOMETHING.

06:03.798 --> 06:05.713
OK.

06:05.713 --> 06:07.062
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

06:07.062 --> 06:08.193
I'M FINE.

06:12.807 --> 06:14.635
I'M IN TROUBLE HERE.

06:16.071 --> 06:18.073
WHAT, W-WITH POLI SCI?

06:18.073 --> 06:19.814
NED, COME ON,
IF YOU GET A "B",

06:19.814 --> 06:22.294
THAT'S 85 POINTS
MINUS 10 FOR BEING LATE.

06:22.294 --> 06:24.209
WHICH BRINGS ME
TO A "D" OVERALL

06:24.209 --> 06:25.994
WHEN YOU AVERAGE IN
THE MIDTERM,

06:25.994 --> 06:27.952
WHICH MAKES
MY G.P.A. 1.9,

06:27.952 --> 06:31.565
WHICH PUTS ME ON
ACADEMIC PROBATION.

06:31.565 --> 06:34.742
WAIT...WHY DID I...

06:34.742 --> 06:36.570
I THOUGHT
YOU WERE DOING OK.

06:36.570 --> 06:38.267
I KNOW. I JUST...

06:38.267 --> 06:41.009
AH, I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO MULTITASK
LIKE YOU.

06:41.009 --> 06:44.229
I MEAN, YOU SPEND
ALL THIS TIME
WITH ME AND...

06:44.229 --> 06:46.057
THEN CRAM
AND PULL OFF As,

06:46.057 --> 06:48.712
AND ME, I JUST...

06:48.712 --> 06:50.366
I CAN'T.

06:52.934 --> 06:55.023
BUT, LISTEN, GO.

06:55.023 --> 06:56.764
YOU KNOW, I MEAN,
YOU--YOU SHOULD GO.

06:59.375 --> 07:01.682
NO, I-I'M NOT.
I'M GOING TO, UH--

07:01.682 --> 07:03.423
YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M GOING TO DO?

07:03.423 --> 07:05.729
I'M GOING TO...
BLOW OFF DINNER AT HOME,

07:05.729 --> 07:07.601
AND I'M GOING
TO SPEND THE NIGHT
WITH YOU HERE,

07:07.601 --> 07:09.820
AND I'M GOING TO WORK
ON YOUR PAPER.JULIA, NO.

07:09.820 --> 07:11.866
AND YOU'RE GOING TO GET
AN "A," AND YOU'RE GOING
TO STAY OFF PROBATION,

07:11.866 --> 07:15.478
AND WE'RE BOTH
GOING TO GET TO GO HOME
AND HAVE CHRISTMAS.

07:15.478 --> 07:17.175
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO DO THIS.

07:17.175 --> 07:19.177
AND I'M JUST GOING TO
ASK YOU FOR ONE THING.

07:19.177 --> 07:21.789
IN THE FUTURE, DON'T
USE ME AS AN EXCUSE
FOR NOT WORKING,

07:21.789 --> 07:24.095
'CAUSE...
I--I DON'T WANT TO...

07:24.095 --> 07:25.575
FEEL GUILTY FOR SPENDING
TIME WITH YOU.

07:25.575 --> 07:26.576
OK?

07:28.491 --> 07:30.406
AND ONE MORE THING.

07:30.406 --> 07:32.539
I'M GOING TO INSIST
THAT WE GET A ROOM
SOMEWHERE,

07:32.539 --> 07:34.758
'CAUSE ICELANDIANS
COULDN'T STUDY
IN THIS COLD.

07:39.154 --> 07:41.722
OK, SO I DON'T WANT
TO GLOAT OR ANYTHING,

07:41.722 --> 07:43.550
BUT THIS PENCIL HOLDER
THAT I'M MAKING

07:43.550 --> 07:46.596
IS ACTUALLY GOING TO BE ABLE
TO HOLD PENCILS.

07:46.596 --> 07:48.642
NICE.

07:48.642 --> 07:49.512
HEY.

07:51.601 --> 07:53.516
WHAT'S THE MATTER,
OWE?

07:53.516 --> 07:56.388
YOU'RE NOT DONE WITH
CHARLIE'S PRESENT YET.

07:56.388 --> 07:57.999
YES, I AM.

07:59.740 --> 08:01.524
BUT IT'S
BARELY EVEN...

08:01.524 --> 08:02.438
IT'S NOT...

08:03.787 --> 08:05.615
WHATEVER IT'S
SUPPOSED TO BE.

08:05.615 --> 08:07.051
IS EXACTLY WHAT IT IS.

08:07.051 --> 08:09.010
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW,

08:09.010 --> 08:11.055
THERE IS NO GOOD OR BAD
WHEN YOU'RE MAKING
A PRESENT,

08:11.055 --> 08:12.535
SO IF OWEN SAYS
THAT IT'S DONE,

08:12.535 --> 08:13.536
THEN IT'S DONE.

08:13.536 --> 08:15.930
OK.

08:15.930 --> 08:18.062
SO WHAT'D
YOU MAKE THERE...

08:18.062 --> 08:20.108
FOR CHARLIE?

08:20.108 --> 08:22.545
WHAT'S YOUR PILE OF CLAY
SUPPOSED TO BE?

08:22.545 --> 08:24.373
A PILE OF CLAY.

08:24.373 --> 08:26.680
WHICH IS
COMPLETELY FINE.

08:26.680 --> 08:28.682
BECAUSE YOU MADE IT
ESPECIALLY FOR
YOUR BROTHER,

08:28.682 --> 08:30.248
AND YOU HAD A LOT
OF FUN DOING IT, RIGHT?

08:32.947 --> 08:34.818
I KNOW WHAT
EVERYONE'S DOING.

08:35.993 --> 08:37.691
OK?

08:37.691 --> 08:40.737
EVERYONE'S PRETENDING.
LIKE ME STAYING OVER,

08:40.737 --> 08:42.609
LIKE IT'S ALL
SOME SPECIAL TREAT.

08:42.609 --> 08:45.786
BUT I KNOW
WHY I'M STILL HERE.

08:45.786 --> 08:48.789
IT'S 'CAUSE
THEY DON'T WANT ME BACK.

08:48.789 --> 08:50.921
BECAUSE OF THE BABY.

08:50.921 --> 08:52.009
THAT'S ALL.

08:55.665 --> 08:58.929
IF SHE SAYS "MY OOGIE BOOGIE
BASTARD GRANDCHILD"
ONE MORE TIME, I'M--

08:58.929 --> 09:00.409
SHH...

09:00.409 --> 09:02.759
SHE CAN HEAR YOU.GOOD. I HOPE SHE DOES.

09:02.759 --> 09:04.761
I HOPE SHE HEARS ME--THE BABY.

09:04.761 --> 09:06.633
AND STARTS PACKING--YOU'RE GOING
TO WAKE UP THE BABY.

09:06.633 --> 09:08.896
AND COULD YOU NOT
USE YOUR KNEES
FOR EMPHASIS?

09:08.896 --> 09:11.246
THAT'S KIND OF A
TRICKY AREA THERE.

09:11.246 --> 09:12.247
THIS IS--

09:12.247 --> 09:13.291
OW.

09:13.291 --> 09:15.729
THIS IS SERIOUS,
CHARLIE.

09:15.729 --> 09:18.209
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT THIS DOES TO ME.

09:18.209 --> 09:20.472
ALL THIS "I WANT
TO BE A FAMILY" CRAP?

09:20.472 --> 09:21.952
SINCE WHEN?

09:21.952 --> 09:24.694
SINCE THE LAST TIME
SHE CALLED ME, LIKE,

09:24.694 --> 09:25.913
HALF A YEAR AGO?

09:25.913 --> 09:27.567
OK, SO...

09:27.567 --> 09:29.917
IT'S PAINFUL. I GET THAT.
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

09:29.917 --> 09:31.875
SHE'S ALL WE GOT.
I MEAN,

09:31.875 --> 09:34.008
WE HAVEN'T HAD A PARENT
OR A GRANDPARENT

09:34.008 --> 09:35.792
IN THIS HOUSE
FOR, WHAT...

09:35.792 --> 09:36.750
6 YEARS?

09:39.013 --> 09:41.015
CHARLIE, SHE'S JUST--OH.

09:44.758 --> 09:46.586
SHE'S NOT...

09:46.586 --> 09:47.499
OH.

09:49.153 --> 09:53.201
YOU KNOW MY FIRST MEMORY
OF CHRISTMAS EVE AS A KID?

09:53.201 --> 09:55.072
I, UH...

09:55.072 --> 09:56.987
I SNUCK DOWNSTAIRS
REALLY LATE,

09:56.987 --> 10:01.426
AND I SAW
THIS GRAY-HAIRED GUY
STUFFING STOCKINGS,

10:01.426 --> 10:02.950
AND, UH,

10:02.950 --> 10:04.691
FOR A SECOND,
I THOUGHT FOR SURE

10:04.691 --> 10:06.518
HE WAS SANTA.

10:06.518 --> 10:08.477
AND THEN HE TURNED AROUND,

10:08.477 --> 10:11.349
AND OF COURSE
HE WAS MY DAD'S OLD MAN.

10:12.786 --> 10:14.135
BUT...

10:14.135 --> 10:17.791
I WAS ALMOST AS HAPPY
THAT IT WAS HIM,

10:17.791 --> 10:19.793
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT
THE HOLIDAYS ARE ABOUT.

10:19.793 --> 10:22.230
THEY'RE ABOUT
FAMILY GETTING TOGETHER

10:22.230 --> 10:25.059
AND DOING STUFF
FOR EACH OTHER.

10:25.059 --> 10:28.062
AND...

10:28.062 --> 10:30.151
I WANT THAT FOR DIANA.

10:30.151 --> 10:31.543
YOU DON'T KNOW HER,
CHARLIE.

10:31.543 --> 10:33.981
DAPHNE, SHE'S HERE.

10:33.981 --> 10:36.374
SHE EXISTS, AND SHE
WANTS TO BE HERE.

10:37.898 --> 10:40.814
WHICH...

10:40.814 --> 10:42.990
FRANKLY, WE COULD
USE SOME OF THAT
AROUND HERE.

10:52.260 --> 10:55.263
OK. QUICK, WHILE
HE'S IN THE BATHROOM,
LET ME SHOW YOU.

10:55.263 --> 10:57.178
SARAH, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING? WE'RE LATE
FOR HIS REHEARSAL.

10:57.178 --> 10:59.397
LOOK, I KNOW I SAID
WHATEVER HE MADE
FOR CHARLIE

10:59.397 --> 11:01.617
WAS GOING TO BE FINE,
BUT THEN I THOUGHT, WHY NOT
SOMETHING NICE INSTEAD?

11:01.617 --> 11:03.445
SO I STAYED UP AND
I TURNED HIS PILE OF CLAY

11:03.445 --> 11:05.621
INTO AN AMAZING
PAINTED TREE FROG--
OH, MY GOD...

11:07.188 --> 11:09.364
IS THAT
ALL THE STUFF...

11:09.364 --> 11:11.279
HOW DID...

11:11.279 --> 11:12.280
DID OWEN...

11:16.371 --> 11:18.939
BAILEY, WHAT
ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

11:18.939 --> 11:21.332
I MEAN, YOU HAVE TO
SAY SOMETHING TO HIM.
YOU HAVE TO TALK TO HIM.

11:21.332 --> 11:23.378
NOW?

11:23.378 --> 11:25.336
WHEN PROBABLY
THE ONLY REASON
HE DID THIS

11:25.336 --> 11:26.729
IS BECAUSE HE THINKS
HIS FAMILY HATES HIM?

11:26.729 --> 11:28.644
MAYBE HE NEEDS IT.

11:28.644 --> 11:30.907
YOU KNOW, MAYBE
HE NEEDS THE ATTENTION.

11:30.907 --> 11:33.344
NO, NOT LIKE THIS.
NOT ON CHRISTMAS EVE.

11:33.344 --> 11:34.694
THERE'S GOT TO BE--

11:44.225 --> 11:45.879
BAILEY...

11:45.879 --> 11:47.837
YOU WANT TO SAY ANYTHING?

11:52.755 --> 11:54.844
HEY, CHAMP.

11:54.844 --> 11:57.107
YOU READY
FOR THAT REHEARSAL?

11:59.544 --> 12:02.243
WELL, THEN WAIT FOR ME
TO GET THERE, CLAUD.

12:02.243 --> 12:03.897
OR GET CHARLIE
TO HELP YOU OUT.

12:03.897 --> 12:05.768
I KNOW. I MISS YOU, TOO,

12:05.768 --> 12:07.422
BUT I'LL BE THERE
SOON, OK?

12:07.422 --> 12:08.336
OK. BYE.

12:10.947 --> 12:13.384
COME HERE.
READ THIS.

12:16.126 --> 12:18.346
OK.

12:18.346 --> 12:21.479
"WORLD WAR II WAS ONLY THAT
AFTER PROPAGANDA WARS
WERE FIRST..."

12:21.479 --> 12:22.829
NO, NO, NO.

12:22.829 --> 12:25.048
IF YOU WANT TO ACE
THIS THING,

12:25.048 --> 12:26.397
YOU GOT TO--YOU
GOT TO SAY SOMETHING
MORE ORIGINAL.

12:26.397 --> 12:28.530
LIKE, UM...

12:28.530 --> 12:30.662
LIKE THE REASON
ISOLATIONISTS LOST
WAS BECAUSE THEY...

12:30.662 --> 12:32.621
FOLLOWED THEIR OWN
PHILOSOPHY AND
ISOLATED THEMSELVES,

12:32.621 --> 12:34.623
OR--OR SOMETHING.NO. NO, THAT'S GOOD.

12:34.623 --> 12:35.972
THAT'S PERFECT.

12:35.972 --> 12:37.539
TYPE THAT
BEFORE YOU FORGET IT.

12:37.539 --> 12:39.410
OK, START
PULLING QUOTES.

12:39.410 --> 12:41.369
AND PUT DOWN
THE REMOTE. NO MORE
PAY-PER-VIEW PORNO

12:41.369 --> 12:42.762
TILL WE'RE DONE.

12:42.762 --> 12:44.851
HEY, IT'S ONLY SOFT-CORE,

12:44.851 --> 12:46.766
AND WE NEVER WOULD'VE
STAYED AWAKE LAST NIGHT
WITHOUT IT.

12:46.766 --> 12:48.985
OK, BUT I'M ABOUT
TO WRITE STALIN
INTO A 3-WAY,

12:48.985 --> 12:51.727
SO NOT NOW.

12:51.727 --> 12:52.728
HEY,

12:52.728 --> 12:54.295
LISTEN, UM,

12:54.295 --> 12:56.384
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW

12:56.384 --> 12:58.473
THAT WHATEVER
YOU'RE MISSING

12:58.473 --> 12:59.779
AT HOME RIGHT NOW...

13:02.607 --> 13:03.826
YOU'RE SAVING MY LIFE.

13:06.568 --> 13:08.483
NED, STOP SAYING THAT.

13:08.483 --> 13:10.006
'CAUSE, REALLY,

13:10.006 --> 13:11.268
YOU'RE PRACTICALLY
DOING ME A FAVOR.

13:11.268 --> 13:12.966
DAY BEFORE CHRISTMAS,

13:12.966 --> 13:15.403
SWARMING SHOPPING MALLS
AND TANGLED TREE LIGHTS,

13:15.403 --> 13:17.840
YOU KNOW,
WHO NEEDS THAT?

13:17.840 --> 13:19.799
I'D MUCH RATHER
RELIVE WORLD WAR II.

13:21.888 --> 13:23.193
HEY, HEY, HEY,

13:23.193 --> 13:24.499
COME ON, WAIT, WAIT--N-N-NO--

13:24.499 --> 13:26.240
NO, WE HAVE TO WORK.

13:34.509 --> 13:36.772
OH. HI.

13:36.772 --> 13:39.427
DID YOU HAVE SOMETHING
TO WASH? I'M ABOUT
TO RUN A LOAD OF WHITES.

13:39.427 --> 13:41.908
YOU GOT IT RIGHT THERE.
LES' WORK PANTS.

13:41.908 --> 13:44.911
TRY AND FOLD IT
ON THE CREASE.

13:44.911 --> 13:48.349
RIGHT.
SORRY.

13:48.349 --> 13:51.874
DO YOU MIND IF I ASK YOU
A QUESTION, CHARLIE?

13:51.874 --> 13:53.833
DO YOU LOVE
MY LITTLE GIRL?

13:53.833 --> 13:56.009
REALLY?

13:56.009 --> 13:58.359
YEAH.

13:58.359 --> 13:59.621
I DO.

13:59.621 --> 14:01.275
I DEFINITELY...

14:01.275 --> 14:03.059
THEN WHY DON'T YOU
MARRY HER?

14:03.059 --> 14:04.408
GIVE THE GIRL A RING.

14:06.497 --> 14:08.151
WE KIND OF HAVE
AN UNDERSTANDING,

14:08.151 --> 14:09.370
AND, UM...

14:09.370 --> 14:10.806
IT'S COMPLICATED,
BUT IT--

14:10.806 --> 14:13.026
Kirsten: CHARLIE...

14:13.026 --> 14:15.506
YOU HAVE GOT TO SEE
WHAT SHE'S DOING.

14:15.506 --> 14:17.944
YOU BLOW ON HER MOUTH
JUST A LITTLE,

14:17.944 --> 14:20.685
AND SHE MAKES
THIS MOST AMAZING
LITTLE FISH FACE.

14:20.685 --> 14:21.991
[CHUCKLING]

14:23.775 --> 14:26.039
HEY. HAVE YOU SEEN
THOSE OLD CHRISTMAS LIGHTS?

14:26.039 --> 14:27.605
THESE ARE, LIKE, DEAD.

14:27.605 --> 14:29.042
THEY'RE OVER THERE
IN THE CHEST.

14:31.392 --> 14:33.568
WHAT ARE YOU
LOOKING FOR?

14:33.568 --> 14:34.830
SOME BIKE PARTS,

14:34.830 --> 14:36.701
A NEW GUITAR
OR SOMETHING?

14:36.701 --> 14:39.182
A NEW APARTMENT,
ACTUALLY.

14:39.182 --> 14:40.444
WHAT?

14:40.444 --> 14:41.837
YOU MEAN...

14:41.837 --> 14:43.012
GRIFFIN.

14:43.012 --> 14:44.884
WELL...

14:44.884 --> 14:48.148
I THINK MY JOB
IS DONE HERE.

14:48.148 --> 14:50.846
NOW THAT I'VE RUINED
JULIA'S LIFE AND YOURS.

14:50.846 --> 14:51.847
RUINED?

14:51.847 --> 14:53.196
LOOK, CHARLIE TOLD ME

14:53.196 --> 14:54.719
THAT YOU MAY BE
HAVING TO STAY BACK.

14:54.719 --> 14:56.286
THAT IS SUCH BULL.

14:56.286 --> 14:58.114
I MEAN, I'D HAVE TO
WRITE THEM A LETTER

14:58.114 --> 15:00.551
SAYING
WHY I LEFT AND--
AND HOW SORRY I AM.

15:00.551 --> 15:01.988
I MEAN, IT'S--

15:01.988 --> 15:03.293
I CAN'T BELIEVE
HE TOLD YOU THAT.

15:03.293 --> 15:04.947
I MEAN, HE ACTUALLY...

15:04.947 --> 15:06.340
I'M GOING TO GO FIND HIM
AND TALK TO HIM--

15:06.340 --> 15:07.907
CLAUDIA, NO,
DON'T. PLEASE.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.212
'CAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT?

15:09.212 --> 15:11.867
CHARLIE'S RIGHT.
HE, UH, HE IS.

15:11.867 --> 15:14.783
I MEAN, WHAT AM I
DOING HERE, REALLY?

15:14.783 --> 15:17.481
I MEAN, BESIDES
SAVING MONEY ON RENT.

15:17.481 --> 15:18.874
I'M...

15:18.874 --> 15:20.658
I'M NOT IN THIS FAMILY.

15:21.877 --> 15:23.748
GRIFFIN--

15:23.748 --> 15:26.273
THIS IS A GOOD THING.
IT IS, BECAUSE...

15:26.273 --> 15:28.928
YOU KNOW, SOMEBODY HAD
TO GIVE ME A PUSH.

15:28.928 --> 15:31.147
I MEAN, JULIA,
SHE MOVED ON.

15:31.147 --> 15:33.454
SO SHOULD I.

15:33.454 --> 15:35.630
I MEAN, I SHOULD.

15:35.630 --> 15:37.893
UH, HOW'S THAT TAIL
COMING BACK THERE?

15:37.893 --> 15:39.590
I'M HAVING
A LOT OF TROUBLE

15:39.590 --> 15:40.896
WITH THE SQUIGGLE.
IT WON'T STAY
STUCK OUT.

15:40.896 --> 15:42.811
OK, KIDS?

15:42.811 --> 15:44.856
COULD EVERYONE
GATHER AROUND, PLEASE,
FOR JUST A MINUTE?

15:44.856 --> 15:46.467
I FIRST WANT TO SAY

15:46.467 --> 15:48.599
YOU GUYS ARE DOING
A GREAT JOB WITH YOUR LINES.

15:48.599 --> 15:50.166
YOU ARE.

15:50.166 --> 15:51.863
BUT WE NEED TO WORK ON
WHAT WE'RE FEELING

15:51.863 --> 15:53.430
WHEN YOU'RE
SAYING THEM,

15:53.430 --> 15:55.650
OK?

15:55.650 --> 15:57.217
HE'S THE REASON

15:57.217 --> 15:58.914
CHRISTMAS SPIRIT
IS ABOUT GIVING

15:58.914 --> 16:00.698
AND ABOUT LOVE.

16:00.698 --> 16:02.091
THAT'S WHY
WE CELEBRATE

16:02.091 --> 16:03.571
THE DAY THIS BABY
WAS BORN.

16:03.571 --> 16:04.920
YOU GETTING
THIS, BUD?

16:04.920 --> 16:06.835
CAN I GO?
MY COSTUME'S DONE.

16:06.835 --> 16:08.750
THE DAY THIS SPECIAL
BABY CAME,

16:08.750 --> 16:10.360
THE WHOLE WORLD CHANGED.

16:10.360 --> 16:12.362
YOU KNOW WHAT, BAILEY?
YOU MAY WANT TO--

16:12.362 --> 16:13.711
NO, NO, NO.
HE SHOULD
HEAR THIS,

16:13.711 --> 16:14.712
ABOUT THIS
SPECIAL BABY.

16:14.712 --> 16:16.062
NO! LET GO!

16:16.062 --> 16:17.454
OK, EVERYBODY BACK
IN THEIR PLACES.

16:17.454 --> 16:18.629
BACK IN YOUR PLACES.

16:20.240 --> 16:21.632
WHAT WAS THAT?

16:21.632 --> 16:23.069
BAILEY,

16:23.069 --> 16:24.940
A SPECIAL BABY?

16:24.940 --> 16:27.160
ONE THAT CHANGES
THE WORLD FOR PEOPLE?

16:27.160 --> 16:29.989
WHO DOES THAT
REMIND YOU OF
IF YOU'RE OWEN?

16:31.512 --> 16:32.992
OH, NO...

16:35.385 --> 16:38.301
THIS STUPID SPIRIT
OF CHRISTMAS.

16:40.086 --> 16:42.740
NED, TURN IT OFF.
I'M BEGGING YOU.

16:42.740 --> 16:44.742
WHY? YOU'RE ON
THE CONCLUSION.

16:44.742 --> 16:47.354
OHH...JUST MUTE IT.

16:47.354 --> 16:50.313
"SO...
THEREFORE,

16:50.313 --> 16:53.055
IT DENIED...
THE BREAST--"

16:54.187 --> 16:55.579
"BEST."

16:55.579 --> 16:59.757
"BEST NATURE OF MAN,

16:59.757 --> 17:04.719
A NATURE
THAT NO MERE BORDER
COULD CARESS--"

17:04.719 --> 17:05.850
NNNN...

17:05.850 --> 17:07.548
"UNDRESS."

17:07.548 --> 17:09.506
"REPRESS."

17:10.768 --> 17:13.032
THERE. WE'RE FINISHED.

17:13.032 --> 17:15.817
OK, YOU CAN TURN
THE VOLUME BACK
IF YOU WANT--HA!

17:15.817 --> 17:17.340
MM. THANK YOU.

17:18.907 --> 17:20.778
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

17:20.778 --> 17:23.868
MERRY CHRISTMAS.
OH, MY GOD!

17:23.868 --> 17:25.435
CHRISTMAS EVE!

17:25.435 --> 17:26.654
MY FAMILY.

17:26.654 --> 17:28.743
WHAT--I THOUGHT
YOU WANTED--

17:28.743 --> 17:30.353
UH, YOU WANTED
TO MISS IT.

17:30.353 --> 17:32.268
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

17:32.268 --> 17:34.140
IF I GET BACK NOW,
I CAN MAYBE AVOID
MY BROTHER'S

17:34.140 --> 17:36.664
"ALL WE HAVE
IS EACH OTHER,
JULIA" SPEECH.

17:36.664 --> 17:38.361
OK. UM, OK.

17:38.361 --> 17:40.624
SO, LET ME JUST
PRINT THIS OUT,

17:40.624 --> 17:43.149
THEN I'LL CATCH
A RIDE BACK TO
CAMPUS WITH YOU.

17:43.149 --> 17:45.238
OK. JUST HURRY UP.

17:45.238 --> 17:47.805
HEY, IF I HIT
THE DRUGSTORE
ON MY WAY HOME,

17:47.805 --> 17:49.807
HOW MANY PERSONAL HYGIENE
ITEMS WOULD IT TAKE TO EQUAL,

17:49.807 --> 17:52.114
LIKE,
A NORMAL PRESENT?

17:52.114 --> 17:53.811
AND DRAFT MODE
IS FINE, AND...

17:53.811 --> 17:55.683
NED?
ENTER.

17:55.683 --> 17:57.772
ENTER. DAMN!

17:57.772 --> 17:59.034
WHAT'S WRONG?

17:59.034 --> 18:00.818
THE PRINTER.
IT--IT...

18:00.818 --> 18:02.298
IT'S NOT RESPONDING.

18:02.298 --> 18:03.691
IT MUST'VE GOTTEN
BUMPED IN THE MOVE,

18:03.691 --> 18:04.909
OR IT'S...

18:04.909 --> 18:06.998
IT'S...TOTALLY...

18:06.998 --> 18:08.304
IT'S COOKED!

18:08.304 --> 18:09.914
WAIT. THEN--
THEN--UH...

18:09.914 --> 18:11.264
NO. NO.

18:11.264 --> 18:12.569
FORGET IT.

18:12.569 --> 18:14.310
GO HOME.

HOW TO HELP ME, MOM.

24:48.704 --> 24:51.098

WHAT IT'S LIKE HERE
WITH THIS BABY.

TO KILL ME.

26:06.652 --> 26:07.914

26:09.219 --> 26:11.178
OH. THANK GOD

26:11.178 --> 26:13.484

LET'S JUST START
WITHOUT JULIA.

26:13.484 --> 26:16.705

SOMETIME AROUND EASTER.

26:26.454 --> 26:27.716

HAS TIME FOR THE TREE,

26:27.716 --> 26:29.936
NO ONE HAS TIME
FOR THE MEAL,

26:29.936 --> 26:31.807
AND, OH, I'M SURE
WE'LL ALL COME UP WITH
REAL GOOD EXCUSES

26:31.807 --> 26:34.114
WHEN IT COMES TIME
FOR STOCKINGS,

26:34.114 --> 26:36.551
SO WHY DON'T WE, YOU KNOW,
JUST SPARE OURSELVES
THE POINT OF PRETENDING

26:36.551 --> 26:39.206
AND JUST BLOW
THE WHOLE THING OFF, OK?

26:39.206 --> 26:40.990

27:35.305 --> 27:37.220
IS THERE ONE FOR ME?

27:37.220 --> 27:41.007
NOT SO FAST, BUDDY,
YOU AND ME HAVE
TO HAVE A LITTLE...

27:41.007 --> 27:44.097
WHOA! 2 PACKAGES!
AND ONE'S BATTERIES.

27:44.097 --> 27:46.708
CLAUD, LOOKS LIKE
A SWEATER FOR YOU.

27:46.708 --> 27:49.102
WELL, COULD YOU
AT LEAST LET ME
UNWRAP IT FIRST?

27:49.102 --> 27:51.017
SARAH.

27:51.017 --> 27:53.236
REALLY?
ONE FOR ME? YEAH.

27:53.236 --> 27:55.369
BAY.

27:55.369 --> 27:57.197
THANKS.

27:57.197 --> 27:58.285
AND...DAPHNE.

27:58.285 --> 27:59.982
WHERE'S DAPH?

27:59.982 --> 28:02.419
I THINK I SAW HER
GO UPSTAIRS.

28:02.419 --> 28:05.292
WELL, YOU GET ONE, TOO,
CHARLIE.

28:06.946 --> 28:08.730
WHAT, YOU CAN'T
FIND ONE OVER THERE?

28:08.730 --> 28:12.342
CLAUDIA, DIDN'T YOU GET
YOUR BROTHER A PRESENT?

28:12.342 --> 28:14.170
DIDN'T YOU?

28:14.170 --> 28:16.477
IT'S OK. SOMETHING
WILL TURN UP TOMORROW.

28:16.477 --> 28:18.871
NO. COME ON, THERE'S
GOTTA BE SOMETHING.

28:18.871 --> 28:20.394
OH, WAIT.
HERE'S SOMETHING.

28:22.004 --> 28:23.266
IT'S FROM GRIFFIN.

28:33.624 --> 28:35.583
YEAH, IT'S RIGHT HERE.

28:35.583 --> 28:37.759
BUILDING 115.

28:41.545 --> 28:43.547
YOU JUST LEAVE IT
IN THE BOX?

28:43.547 --> 28:45.549
HOW'S HE GONNA KNOW
WHEN IT CAME IN?

28:45.549 --> 28:47.943
HE SAID HE WAS GONNA CHECK
THE BOX BEFORE MIDNIGHT.

28:47.943 --> 28:50.903
ON CHRISTMAS EVE?
WHY WOULD HE--

28:50.903 --> 28:53.949
IS THIS MEMO--

28:53.949 --> 28:56.256
DID YOU SEE THIS NOTE?
IT'S FOR YOUR CLASS.

28:56.256 --> 28:57.866
YEAH. FORGET IT, JULE.

28:57.866 --> 28:59.912
I MEAN, THE PAPER'S IN.
LET'S--

28:59.912 --> 29:02.436
WHY DON'T YOU LET ME
DRIVE YOU HOME?

29:02.436 --> 29:04.090
IT SAYS LATE PAPERS

29:04.090 --> 29:05.831
WILL GET
A 2-DAY GRACE PERIOD
OVER THE HOLIDAYS.

29:05.831 --> 29:07.833
I COULD STAY AT
MY PARENTS' HOUSE TONIGHT

29:07.833 --> 29:09.748
AND MAYBE DROP BY
YOUR PLACE TOMORROW.

29:09.748 --> 29:11.706
HOW COULD YOU NOT
HAVE SEEN THIS, NED?

29:11.706 --> 29:13.099
IT'S DATED A WEEK AGO.

29:13.099 --> 29:15.057
WHAT? I MEAN,
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

29:15.057 --> 29:18.017
WELL, I STAYED AN EXTRA
DAY TO SAVE YOUR
GRADE POINT AVERAGE.

29:18.017 --> 29:21.934
IT WOULD'VE BEEN NICE
TO KNOW IF--IF...

29:21.934 --> 29:23.849
WHAT?

29:27.940 --> 29:29.637
YOU KNEW ABOUT THIS,
DIDN'T YOU?

29:29.637 --> 29:31.160
JULIA, COME ON.

29:31.160 --> 29:34.207
YOU KEPT SAYING
DON'T LEAVE.

29:34.207 --> 29:37.863
DON'T LEAVE, BUT YOU
FIXED IT SO I WOULDN'T.

29:37.863 --> 29:40.691
I HAD TO WRITE
THE PAPER, JULIA.

29:40.691 --> 29:42.650
DID YOU MAKE
THE REST UP, TOO?

29:42.650 --> 29:44.478
LIKE THE PRINTING PLACE,
THE WAY YOU SAID
YOU CALLED ALL AROUND

29:44.478 --> 29:46.480
AND THEY WERE CLOSED,
BUT WHEN WE FOUND ONE

29:46.480 --> 29:48.482
AND IT WAS OPEN,
YOU DIDN'T EVEN TRY
TO GET IN.

29:48.482 --> 29:50.701
SO I WASN'T READY TO
BREAK THE DOOR DOWN.
SO WHAT?

29:50.701 --> 29:53.704
AND WHAT ABOUT
ALL THE OTHER STUFF?
YOUR PRINTER BREAKING.

29:53.704 --> 29:55.315
YOU'RE LIKE
JOE COMPUTER.

29:55.315 --> 29:57.317
THAT TIME YOU HACKED
ON TO MY MACHINE?

29:57.317 --> 30:00.320
BUT TONIGHT, YOU GAVE UP
IN HALF A SECOND...

30:00.320 --> 30:01.712
BECAUSE YOU--

30:01.712 --> 30:03.758
YOU DIDN'T WANT
TO FINISH, DID YOU?

30:03.758 --> 30:05.586
DID YOU?!

30:06.892 --> 30:08.197
JUL--

30:08.197 --> 30:10.069
GOD! WHAT IS THE MATTER
WITH YOU, NED?!

30:10.069 --> 30:11.722
DID YOU THINK YOU
WERE BEING ROMANTIC
OR SOMETHING?

30:11.722 --> 30:13.333
DID YOU THINK THIS
WAS WHAT I WANTED?

30:13.333 --> 30:15.465
'CAUSE I HAVE BROTHERS
AND SISTERS AT HOME,

30:15.465 --> 30:17.337
AND FOR THE LAST DAY
AND A HALF,

30:17.337 --> 30:19.339
YOU'VE JUST BEEN SITTING
THERE WATCHING ME--

30:19.339 --> 30:21.210
NO, MAKING ME--
LIE TO THEM!

30:24.300 --> 30:25.214
OH...

30:29.436 --> 30:31.699
BAILEY, NO!

30:31.699 --> 30:32.613
SIT DOWN.

30:33.701 --> 30:36.617
OWEN. OWEN, SIT DOWN.

30:36.617 --> 30:38.140
WHY?

30:41.665 --> 30:43.406
TELL ME WHAT THIS IS.

30:43.406 --> 30:45.582
I'M BUSY.

30:45.582 --> 30:48.455
NO. YOU'RE NOT BUSY.
YOU'RE TALKING
TO ME NOW.

30:49.978 --> 30:51.980
YOU STOLE THIS
FROM THE CHURCH,

30:51.980 --> 30:53.590
AND THEN YOU LIED
ABOUT IT,

30:53.590 --> 30:54.853
AND THOSE ARE
VERY BAD THINGS.

30:54.853 --> 30:56.593
OWEN, VERY BAD.

30:56.593 --> 30:59.292
WHY? IT'S JUST
A STUPID PLASTIC BABY.

30:59.292 --> 31:01.860
BECAUSE THIS BABY
MATTERS TO PEOPLE.

31:01.860 --> 31:03.862
AND IF IT DOESN'T
MATTER TO YOU,

31:03.862 --> 31:06.516
THAT'S NO EXCUSE.
YOU RESPECT WHAT MATTERS
TO OTHER PEOPLE,

31:06.516 --> 31:08.475
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT
THE ONLY PERSON
IN THIS WORLD.

31:08.475 --> 31:09.563
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?

31:11.521 --> 31:13.523
NOW, WE'RE GOING
TO CALL THAT CHURCH,

31:13.523 --> 31:15.177
AND WE'RE GOING
TO TELL THEM THAT
YOU TOOK THIS BABY.

31:15.177 --> 31:16.396
BAILEY, NO!

31:16.396 --> 31:18.398
YES! YES!
AND THEN TOMORROW,

31:18.398 --> 31:20.400
YOU'RE GOING
TO GO BACK THERE IN
THE MORNING WITH ME

31:20.400 --> 31:22.489
NO!AND YOU'RE GOING TO SAY
YOU'RE SORRY TO THEIR FACES.

31:22.489 --> 31:24.883
NO, I DON'T WANT TO, BAILEY.
PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME.

31:24.883 --> 31:26.841
AND THEN WE'RE GOING
TO TALK ABOUT WHAT'S
GOING ON WITH YOU.

31:26.841 --> 31:28.277
LISTEN TO ME!

31:28.277 --> 31:29.670
ALL THIS JUNK
YOU'VE BEEN PULLING.

31:29.670 --> 31:31.672
THAT STUFF OF SARAH'S
THAT YOU BROKE?

31:31.672 --> 31:34.762
YOU THINK BECAUSE
THERE'S ANOTHER BABY
IN THIS FAMILY

31:34.762 --> 31:36.677
THAT YOU COULD DO
WHATEVER YOU WANT?

31:36.677 --> 31:38.679
YOU THINK BECAUSE
YOU'RE NOT GETTING
ENOUGH ATTENTION

31:38.679 --> 31:40.550
YOU CAN GET AWAY
WITH ANYTHING?
WELL, YOU'RE WRONG.

31:40.550 --> 31:44.685
SO, YOU'D BETTER
START BEHAVING,
OWEN,

31:44.685 --> 31:47.644
BECAUSE I AM GOING
TO BE WATCHING
EVERYTHING YOU DO.

31:47.644 --> 31:49.342
YOU HEAR ME?

31:49.342 --> 31:51.692
[CRYING]

31:51.692 --> 31:52.606
DO YOU?

32:02.224 --> 32:04.618
WHAT WAS IT LIKE BACK THEN

32:04.618 --> 32:06.576
WHEN I WAS DIANA'S AGE?

32:06.576 --> 32:09.579
WAS IT HARD FOR YOU
TO GO TO WORK EVERY DAY?

32:09.579 --> 32:11.973
DID YOU MISS ME
WHEN I WASN'T THERE?

32:11.973 --> 32:15.237
WHAT ARE YOU--WHY ARE
YOU ASKING ME THIS?

32:15.237 --> 32:16.717
BECAUSE I'M CURIOUS.

32:16.717 --> 32:18.762
I WANT TO KNOW
HOW YOU FELT...

32:18.762 --> 32:22.418
WHEN YOU WENT TO WORK OR
WHEN YOU WENT OUT AT NIGHT.

32:22.418 --> 32:26.683
LOOK, UH, I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ANYMORE ABOUT
HOW IT'S ALL MY FAULT.

32:26.683 --> 32:29.860
BECAUSE I WANT TO KNOW
IF IT'S THE SAME WAY
THAT I FEEL...

32:31.601 --> 32:33.734
ABOUT DIANA.

32:35.779 --> 32:39.827
I WANT TO KNOW IF IT WAS
AS EASY FOR YOU TO LEAVE
AS IT IS FOR ME.

32:43.787 --> 32:46.965
I DON'T KNOW.

32:46.965 --> 32:51.404
'CAUSE...
WHEN I LOOK AT...

32:51.404 --> 32:52.840
MY BABY

32:52.840 --> 32:55.234
AND I WONDER
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN

32:55.234 --> 32:58.498
IF SOMETHING WERE
TO TAKE HER AWAY FROM ME,

32:58.498 --> 33:02.545
OR IF I'D HAVE TO LIVE
THE REST OF MY LIFE
WITHOUT HER, AND...

33:05.026 --> 33:06.723
I WOULD BE OK.

33:08.029 --> 33:10.249
I WOULD ACTUALLY BE OK.

33:12.077 --> 33:15.776
SO, I'VE BEEN THINKING
THAT MAYBE THAT'S WHY...

33:15.776 --> 33:17.604
I AM SO MAD AT YOU.

33:19.606 --> 33:24.828
BECAUSE...WE'RE REALLY
NO DIFFERENT FROM ONE ANOTHER,

33:24.828 --> 33:29.311
WHICH IS EXACTLY--
I MEAN, THAT IS HOW
IT HAPPENS.

33:29.311 --> 33:33.489
A PERSON, A PARENT...

33:33.489 --> 33:36.884
WHO DOESN'T LOVE THEIR KIDS,

33:36.884 --> 33:41.584
THEY HAVE KIDS
WHO GROW UP THE SAME...

33:41.584 --> 33:44.674
AND SO ON AND SO ON.

33:48.374 --> 33:53.727
AND THAT FEELS BAD, MOM,
TO BE A PART OF THAT.

33:53.727 --> 33:56.208
THAT FEELS REALLY,
REALLY BAD.

34:11.962 --> 34:13.834
SO, WHAT'S GOING ON?

34:13.834 --> 34:18.099
WHAT'S GOING ON IS HE'S
UP THERE CRYING HIS EYES OUT.

34:19.231 --> 34:21.450
HE WON'T EVEN LET ME IN.

34:21.450 --> 34:23.713
HE WON'T EVEN TALK TO ME.

34:25.454 --> 34:28.457
BAILEY, SOMEBODY
HAD TO TELL HIM.

34:28.457 --> 34:30.764
NO. NO. IT WAS
THE WRONG THING TO DO,

34:30.764 --> 34:33.375
BECAUSE NOW HE'S UP THERE
BAWLING,

34:33.375 --> 34:35.421
AND HIS CHRISTMAS IS RUINED.

34:35.421 --> 34:38.815
AND HE WAS DOING OK
BEFORE I TALKED TO HIM.

34:38.815 --> 34:41.427
HE WAS DOING MUCH BETTER,
JUST BEING HOME WITH EVERYONE.

34:41.427 --> 34:44.256
HE WASN'T DOING ANYTHING
WRONG OR ANYTHING.

34:46.388 --> 34:50.436
LOOK, BAILEY, I
SHOULDN'T HAVE TOLD YOU.

34:50.436 --> 34:53.787
I MEAN...GOD, I AM
DEFINITELY NOT A MOTHER.

34:53.787 --> 34:56.659
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO
HANDLE THESE THINGS.

34:59.401 --> 35:01.838
HE WON'T EVEN SPEAK TO ME.

35:03.579 --> 35:04.841
IT WAS A MISTAKE.

35:05.973 --> 35:09.803
DOREEN. CAN I SAY SOMETHING?

35:09.803 --> 35:12.849
GIVE US A SEC, LESTER?

35:12.849 --> 35:14.460
ALL RIGHT.

35:17.898 --> 35:21.945
LISTEN, SWEETHEART,
YOU REALLY SHOULD
SAVE YOUR BREATH.

35:21.945 --> 35:24.513
I CAN'T.

35:24.513 --> 35:27.995
I CAN'T. I--BECAUSE
WHEN YOU SHOWED UP HERE

35:27.995 --> 35:29.823
AND YOU SAID,
LET'S BE A FAMILY,

35:29.823 --> 35:31.477
I BELIEVED THAT.

35:31.477 --> 35:34.915
SO, PLEASE, DON'T--
DON'T GO.

35:34.915 --> 35:36.743
TALK TO MY DAUGHTER,
CHARLIE.

35:36.743 --> 35:39.180
NO. I DON'T CARE ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED IN THE PAST.

35:39.180 --> 35:41.095
I CARE ABOUT RIGHT NOW.

35:41.095 --> 35:44.359
I CARE ABOUT HAVING SOMEONE
IN THIS HOUSE FOR MY DAUGHTER.

35:44.359 --> 35:47.319
SHE NEEDS THAT,
AND SHE DOESN'T HAVE THAT

35:47.319 --> 35:48.755
BECAUSE HER MOM...

35:50.496 --> 35:51.758
DAPHNE'S HAVING TROUBLE
FEELING--

35:51.758 --> 35:53.368
CHARLIE, I--

35:53.368 --> 35:54.891
NO. I KNOW THE TWO
OF YOU ARE MAD. I KNOW THAT,

35:54.891 --> 35:56.589
BUT WHEN WE GET MAD
IN MY FAMILY,

35:56.589 --> 35:59.244
WE HAVE THIS RULE,
WHICH IS,

35:59.244 --> 36:03.465
"GO AHEAD, STAY MAD
IF YOU WANT, BUT JUST STAY."

36:04.684 --> 36:05.772
YOU KNOW?

36:08.731 --> 36:11.691
IS ONE OF YOU
GONNA DRIVE US
TO THE BUS STOP,

36:11.691 --> 36:14.346
OR AM I GONNA HAVE
TO CALL A CAB?

36:17.175 --> 36:21.831
WELL...DUH. 3 EXTRA HOURS
IN THE OVEN. I KNEW IT.

36:21.831 --> 36:24.704
AH, I BET YOU COULD BOUNCE
BALL BEARINGS ON MY POTATOES.

36:24.704 --> 36:26.793
LOOK, IT'S NOT THE END
OF THE WORLD, CLAUD.

36:26.793 --> 36:29.012
NO! IT'S JUST THE END
OF THIS DINNER.

36:29.012 --> 36:30.884
WELL, MAYBE IT'S
FOR THE BEST...

36:30.884 --> 36:32.712
IF WE JUST CALL
THIS WHOLE THING OFF.

36:33.974 --> 36:35.932
WHAT?

36:35.932 --> 36:38.108
OH, NO.
NO, NO, NO, NO.

36:38.108 --> 36:40.067
WE WILL NOT CALL THIS OFF.

36:40.067 --> 36:42.461
WHEN THIS FAMILY
HAS THE OPPORTUNITY
TO SIT AROUND A TABLE

36:42.461 --> 36:44.114
LIKE WE USED TO
ONCE A WEEK?

36:44.114 --> 36:46.116
I MEAN, CHRISTMAS EVE,
A PROPER CHRISTMAS EVE

36:46.116 --> 36:48.423
MEANS STOCKINGS AND
THE NIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS,

36:48.423 --> 36:50.512
AND A COOKIE
ON THE HEARTH FOR SANTA.

36:50.512 --> 36:55.952
AND WE ARE GOING TO DO
THIS ONE THING RIGHT
OR JUST DIE TRYING!

36:55.952 --> 36:59.695
SO, I'M GOING TO GO OUT
AND BUY OUR CHRISTMAS EVE
DINNER.

36:59.695 --> 37:02.220
EVEN IF IT'S TURKEY JERKY
FROM THE MINIMART.

37:04.265 --> 37:07.442
CLAUDIA, THAT'S VERY--
IT'S VERY MOVING,

37:07.442 --> 37:10.967
BUT I'M WAY TOO BEAT
TO SIT AROUND HERE
AND WAIT ANYMORE.

37:10.967 --> 37:13.579
AND BESIDES, I GOTTA
BE UP AT DAWN.

37:13.579 --> 37:15.929
THE RESTAURANT'S HAVING
THIS HOLIDAY BRUNCH,

37:15.929 --> 37:18.018
SO...I HAVE TO GET HOME.

37:18.018 --> 37:19.498
HAVE TO GET HOME.

37:19.498 --> 37:22.805
WE'LL SEE YA.

37:22.805 --> 37:25.112
I CAN'T--I CAN'T
BELIEVE YOU'RE DOING
THIS FOR CHRISTMAS.

37:25.112 --> 37:27.984
CLAUD, WE'RE GONNA
BE BACK FOR BREAKFAST
IN LIKE AN HOUR.

37:27.984 --> 37:29.247
Owen: BAILEY!

37:30.726 --> 37:32.380
OWEN.

37:32.380 --> 37:33.251
HEY.

37:35.688 --> 37:38.952
YOU OK?

37:38.952 --> 37:43.043
WE'RE GONNA GO NOW, BUT
WE'LL BE BACK TOMORROW, OK?

37:43.043 --> 37:44.697
I'M COMING WITH YOU.

37:44.697 --> 37:46.438
WHOA.

37:46.438 --> 37:48.962
NO, NO, NO.
YOU SHOULD STAY HERE.

37:48.962 --> 37:51.181
WE'RE GONNA BE BACK
IN THE MORNING. IT'S OK.

37:51.181 --> 37:52.792
BUT I WANT TO COME
WITH YOU.

37:52.792 --> 37:55.969
HEY, BUDDY, YOU CAN
STAY HERE. IT'S OK.

37:55.969 --> 37:58.363
WE'LL GET UP
IN THE MORNING TOGETHER

37:58.363 --> 38:00.408
AND OPEN STOCKINGS
LIKE WE ALWAYS DO.

38:00.408 --> 38:01.888
I WANT TO STAY
WITH BAILEY.

38:01.888 --> 38:03.890
I'M GONNA GET
MY STUFF,

38:03.890 --> 38:05.848
AND I'M GONNA GO
WITH BAILEY.

38:14.509 --> 38:16.946
HE'S JUST A LITTLE OFF,
YOU KNOW,

38:16.946 --> 38:18.339
WITH ALL THE EXCITEMENT
AND EVERYTHING.

38:18.339 --> 38:19.906
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO EXPLAIN IT.

38:19.906 --> 38:21.560
I GET IT.

38:21.560 --> 38:23.866
HE'S GONNA BE BEGGING
TO COME BACK HERE.

38:23.866 --> 38:26.869
SOON AS YOU'RE READY
TO TAKE HIM.

38:26.869 --> 38:27.740
YEAH. I KNOW.

38:29.959 --> 38:31.309
SOON.

38:40.753 --> 38:42.232
YEAH.

39:04.211 --> 39:05.647
SORRY. JUST...

39:05.647 --> 39:07.649
SAW A LIGHT ON.

39:07.649 --> 39:10.043
DON'T SWEAT IT.
IT'S YOUR HOUSE.

39:10.043 --> 39:13.438
CAN I, UH, COME IN
FOR A MINUTE?

39:13.438 --> 39:15.091
[BABY CRIES]

39:15.091 --> 39:17.964
SHH, SHH, SHH.

39:17.964 --> 39:19.008
HELLO!

39:19.008 --> 39:20.445
IS EVERYBODY IN THE--

39:22.055 --> 39:22.969
KITCHEN?

39:30.019 --> 39:31.020
CHARLIE?

39:32.239 --> 39:33.153
BAILEY?

39:34.241 --> 39:35.285
CLAUD?

39:38.332 --> 39:39.333
SANTA?

40:26.728 --> 40:30.689
I JUST WANTED TO THANK YOU
FOR THE SCRAPBOOK. I, UH...

40:30.689 --> 40:34.693
SPENT, LIKE, AN HOUR,
AND I HAVEN'T...

40:34.693 --> 40:36.695
GOTTEN TO THE END YET.

40:36.695 --> 40:37.696
REALLY?

40:37.696 --> 40:39.437
YEAH.

40:39.437 --> 40:41.439
THAT BIOPSY
YOU PUT IN THERE,

40:41.439 --> 40:44.398
THE ONE THAT--
THAT CLEARED ME?

40:44.398 --> 40:46.400
IT JUST REMINDED ME THAT...

40:47.662 --> 40:49.316
WHEN THAT HAPPENED, I...

40:49.316 --> 40:53.102
I WANTED OUT OF HERE
SO BAD.

40:53.102 --> 40:55.191
JUST, UH...

40:55.191 --> 40:56.845
HIT THE ROAD

40:56.845 --> 41:01.154
AND START MY LIFE
OVER AGAIN, BUT...

41:01.154 --> 41:04.026
I'M A FAMILY MAN.

41:04.026 --> 41:07.073
AND, UM...
ALL I KEEP THINKING
IS THAT...

41:07.073 --> 41:09.467
YOU DON'T HAVE THAT.

41:09.467 --> 41:12.078
YOU'RE AS FREE
AS A BIRD,

41:12.078 --> 41:14.210
BUT YOU...STAY ANYWAY.

41:14.210 --> 41:16.952
SO THE...

41:16.952 --> 41:19.259
THE ONLY TWO PEOPLE
WHO ACTUALLY
WANT TO BE HERE

41:19.259 --> 41:20.521
ARE YOU AND CLAUDIA,

41:20.521 --> 41:23.089
AND I'M, LIKE...

41:23.089 --> 41:25.308
PUSHING YOU AWAY.

41:25.308 --> 41:27.267
AND EVERYONE ELSE,

41:27.267 --> 41:29.661
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE
SUPPOSED TO BE FAMILY,

41:29.661 --> 41:32.359
WHO ACTUALLY SHARE
MY DAUGHTER'S BLOOD...

41:32.359 --> 41:34.579
THEY CAN'T WAIT TO LEAVE.

41:36.537 --> 41:39.018
IT JUST MAKES ME THINK
THAT...

41:41.673 --> 41:44.240
IF YOU'RE NOT FAMILY,
I DON'T KNOW WHO IS.

41:53.075 --> 41:56.426
IF YOU EVER GET OUT
TO ABILENE...

41:56.426 --> 41:58.037
I'LL CALL YOU.

41:59.212 --> 42:00.213
SO...

42:02.911 --> 42:04.696
BE HAPPY, DOLL.

42:11.180 --> 42:13.139
YEAH, YOU, TOO.

42:19.667 --> 42:22.322
WINDOW'S RIGHT OVER THERE.

42:22.322 --> 42:23.628
HUH?

42:23.628 --> 42:25.934
IF YOU WANT TO BUY
A TICKET.

42:25.934 --> 42:27.588
ARE YOU BUYING A TICKET?

42:40.427 --> 42:42.037
HEY.

42:42.037 --> 42:43.430
JULIA.

42:43.430 --> 42:45.301
WHAT ARE YOU, UH,

42:45.301 --> 42:48.391
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING BACK?

42:48.391 --> 42:51.612
I DROVE TO MY HOUSE,
AND...

42:51.612 --> 42:55.007
I RAN UP THE STAIRS...

42:55.007 --> 42:58.053
AND I WENT INSIDE,
BUT NOBODY WAS THERE.

42:58.053 --> 43:02.188
BUT THEN I--I STARTED
LOOKING AROUND, AND...

43:02.188 --> 43:05.191
EVERYTHING THAT I SAW...

43:05.191 --> 43:09.456
IT REMINDED ME
OF ALL THIS STUFF.

43:09.456 --> 43:12.415
THE--THE CANCER
AND--AND ALL THIS...

43:12.415 --> 43:13.765
STUFF WE WENT THROUGH.

43:13.765 --> 43:17.377
AND I LOVE THEM ALL,
AND...

43:17.377 --> 43:20.032
IT'S NOBODY'S FAULT,
BUT...

43:20.032 --> 43:23.252
I DON'T WANT TO GO BACK
TO ALL THAT STUFF.

43:23.252 --> 43:24.689
LOOK, JULIA--

43:24.689 --> 43:26.908
I'M NOT FORGIVING YOU,
NED.

43:26.908 --> 43:28.518
'CAUSE I'M STILL
REALLY MAD AT YOU,
SO DON'T TRY TO--

43:28.518 --> 43:30.129
NO.

43:30.129 --> 43:31.304
'CAUSE I DIDN'T COME HERE
TO FORGIVE YOU.

43:31.304 --> 43:32.610
I CAME HERE TO...

43:34.307 --> 43:37.440
WHAT YOU DID WAS SO...

43:39.399 --> 43:41.836
NO ONE'S EVER WORKED...

43:41.836 --> 43:44.230
SO HARD
TO KEEP ME AROUND.

43:46.972 --> 43:49.583
AND, I MEAN,
I HA--I...

43:49.583 --> 43:52.281
I HATE HOW YOU DID IT.

43:52.281 --> 43:56.242
AND I DON'T EVER WANT YOU
TO PULL A MOVE LIKE THAT
AGAIN, EVER.

43:59.288 --> 44:00.289
BUT...

44:01.943 --> 44:03.379
THANK YOU.

44:07.688 --> 44:09.690
GIVE ME THOSE EGG ROLLS.

44:09.690 --> 44:11.692
I AM STARVING.

44:11.692 --> 44:13.346
SOMEBODY OPENED THEM
ALREADY.

44:13.346 --> 44:14.695
OH. YEAH.
SORRY.

44:14.695 --> 44:15.957
GROSS.

44:15.957 --> 44:18.394
HEY, GET GRIFFIN
A PRESENT.

44:18.394 --> 44:19.439
OK.

44:19.439 --> 44:21.354
NO WAY.

44:21.354 --> 44:23.748
OH. MY HANDS--
THEY'RE SO GREASY.

44:27.273 --> 44:28.317
