WEBVTT

00:10.687 --> 00:13.076
Have you noticed there are fewer
hazelnuts in these biscotti?

00:13.727 --> 00:15.319
Then I'm not crazy.

00:15.487 --> 00:17.443
And yet they've gone up 25 cents.

00:17.607 --> 00:19.245
Fewer nuts, more money.

00:19.407 --> 00:22.365
Something I've been aspiring to
my entire professional life.

00:24.487 --> 00:26.125
[PANTING]

00:26.967 --> 00:31.006
God, that is the last time
I jog in these shorts.

00:31.167 --> 00:34.603
My thighs are chafing like a couple
of hams wrapped in Velcro.

00:36.007 --> 00:38.043
Non-fat mocha, please.

00:42.327 --> 00:43.601
What?

00:43.767 --> 00:46.042
As flattered as we are that
you've chosen our company over,

00:46.207 --> 00:47.765
oh, say, a shower...

00:48.967 --> 00:51.606
...perhaps you'd like to go to the
ladies' room to freshen up a bit?

00:51.767 --> 00:54.440
Hey, at least I try
to keep in shape.

00:54.607 --> 00:56.837
I haven't seen either one of you
run an eight-minute mile.

00:57.007 --> 00:58.998
Stand upwind of us and you might.

01:01.967 --> 01:04.765
Oh, by the way, Niles, my benefit
for the Seattle Theatre Ensemble

01:04.927 --> 01:06.679
is tonight. I haven't
received your check yet.

01:06.847 --> 01:08.678
That's because I'm still
not sure if I'm coming.

01:08.847 --> 01:10.963
Whom should I expect
to meet there?

01:11.367 --> 01:13.801
Professional people
around our age.

01:14.527 --> 01:16.358
- A certain social standing.
- Yes.

01:16.527 --> 01:18.085
Civic-minded,
interested in the arts...

01:18.247 --> 01:19.965
Oh, for God's sake,
how many women?

01:20.127 --> 01:21.162
Why didn't you just say so?

01:21.327 --> 01:23.124
Well, I thought my
rutting-monkey body language

01:23.287 --> 01:24.879
would have tipped you off.

01:26.167 --> 01:27.520
Well, judging from my RSVP list,

01:27.687 --> 01:29.405
there should be quite
a few available women.

01:29.567 --> 01:31.523
Well, in that case, I'll be there.

01:31.687 --> 01:34.281
Here's my money.
Better be worth my while.

01:34.767 --> 01:36.359
Oh, look, here comes
Sherry and Dad.

01:36.527 --> 01:38.085
- Duck.
- No, no, it's all right.

01:38.247 --> 01:40.158
- I invited them.
- Sherry's not going to be there

01:40.327 --> 01:42.124
at your benefit is she?
I can stop that check.

01:42.287 --> 01:43.879
Just relax, Niles.

01:44.167 --> 01:47.079
I've come up with rather an ingenious
plan to occupy their evening tonight.

01:47.447 --> 01:50.325
I bought them tickets to an event
that's right up their alley.

01:50.487 --> 01:52.125
God, I was so mortified
buying the tickets,

01:52.287 --> 01:54.517
I paid cash so they
couldn't trace it back to me.

01:55.527 --> 01:57.563
- Sherry, Dad. Hi.
REBECCA: Excuse me, people.

01:57.727 --> 01:59.206
Did somebody leave
some tickets here?

01:59.367 --> 02:01.722
- Oh, Lord. Yes!
- Something called "Nashville on Ice,

02:01.887 --> 02:04.321
- Yes, right here.
- The All-Skating Country Jamboree"?

02:04.487 --> 02:07.081
Yeah, well.
Well, don't look so smug.

02:07.247 --> 02:09.841
You try skating and blowing into
a jug when your heart's breaking.

02:11.207 --> 02:13.596
I can't believe you
scored tickets to that.

02:13.767 --> 02:16.361
You are well-connected
in this town.

02:16.527 --> 02:18.836
Well, yes, actually,
these are a gift for you and Dad.

02:19.007 --> 02:20.884
- Oh, my God.
- I hope you're free this evening.

02:21.047 --> 02:23.402
Well, we are now.
Wow, Frasier, thanks!

02:23.567 --> 02:25.876
Look at this. Rink side!

02:26.127 --> 02:28.402
Niles, what's that on your cheek?

02:28.567 --> 02:29.886
Oh, what?

02:30.047 --> 02:31.526
My lips.

02:35.887 --> 02:37.843
Oh, look at the time.
I have to go.

02:38.007 --> 02:41.317
Oh, it seems like every time
I see you, you're just leaving.

02:41.487 --> 02:44.126
Yes, and I'd love to stay,
but I have my therapy group meeting,

02:44.287 --> 02:46.596
and last time I was late,
the compulsive gamblers

02:46.767 --> 02:48.120
were betting
the passive-aggressives

02:48.287 --> 02:50.517
that they couldn't
make the overeaters cry.

02:51.647 --> 02:53.797
If you wanna wait here,
I'll get us a couple of coffees.

02:53.967 --> 02:55.605
You know how I like it.
Hot and sweet!

02:55.767 --> 02:57.485
Yeah, but how do
you like your coffee?

02:59.807 --> 03:02.765
- Is he always that funny?
- Oh, yes.

03:04.687 --> 03:05.881
Oh.

03:06.047 --> 03:07.560
It's that damn soap dispenser.

03:07.727 --> 03:09.922
I just gave it a good
pump, and splat.

03:10.087 --> 03:12.123
Oh, I'm sorry.
Roz Doyle, my producer.

03:12.287 --> 03:14.403
<i>You haven't met Dad's
inamorata Sherry Dempsey.</i>

03:14.567 --> 03:15.761
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

03:15.927 --> 03:17.565
I normally look
a lot better than this.

03:17.727 --> 03:20.924
Oh, now, you don't have to be
self-conscious around me, hon.

03:21.087 --> 03:24.159
We all have our bad days
once we pass 40.

03:25.087 --> 03:26.964
It was nice seeing you.

03:27.527 --> 03:29.677
- What did she say?
- Oh, who cares?

03:29.847 --> 03:31.997
It's the least I can do to string
together a few moments

03:32.167 --> 03:33.486
of silence
without her underfoot.

03:33.647 --> 03:36.320
My God, the woman's
practically moved in with me.

03:36.527 --> 03:38.518
What did she say?

03:38.687 --> 03:40.359
Oh, Roz, take heart.
Now come on, listen,

03:40.967 --> 03:42.958
you may not look your best today,
but you know what?

03:43.127 --> 03:46.005
There's a man sitting right over there
who can't keep his eyes off of you.

03:46.167 --> 03:48.920
- Oh, where?
- Right there.

03:52.447 --> 03:53.721
Oh, my God.

03:53.887 --> 03:55.764
That's John Coughlin
from my high school.

03:55.927 --> 03:58.122
Oh, dear God, please
don't let him recognize me.

03:58.287 --> 04:01.120
I swear I'll never leave
the house unbeautiful again.

04:01.287 --> 04:03.323
- Roz?
- Thanks for listening.

04:04.367 --> 04:07.518
Roz Doyle?
It's me. John Coughlin.

04:08.367 --> 04:09.641
Hi, John.

04:09.807 --> 04:12.321
- Look at you.
- Look at you.

04:12.487 --> 04:15.559
I hardly recognized you
with that moustache.

04:16.166 --> 04:18.362
- Roz...
- Oh, Frasier, I'm so sorry.

04:18.807 --> 04:20.923
This is John Coughlin,
Frasier Crane.

04:21.087 --> 04:23.157
- Hello.
- So did you just move to Seattle?

04:23.327 --> 04:24.919
No, I've been here
for a week on business.

04:25.087 --> 04:26.998
Now it's back to Racine.
Remember Marcie?

04:27.167 --> 04:28.759
- Yeah.
- She's getting married Saturday.

04:28.927 --> 04:30.804
- No kidding.
- Well, I'm late for a meeting,

04:30.967 --> 04:33.083
but it was great running into you.
I can't wait to tell

04:33.247 --> 04:35.807
- the whole gang I saw you.
- You don't have to do that.

04:37.047 --> 04:40.198
Frasier, that guy was the
biggest gossip in my hometown.

04:40.367 --> 04:43.677
He saw me with my hair all sweaty
and my sweatshirt full of soap.

04:43.847 --> 04:45.485
Oh, God, what could be worse?

04:45.647 --> 04:47.126
Well, here's a hint.

04:47.287 --> 04:48.959
Got milk?

04:50.367 --> 04:52.039
Oh, my God.

04:56.887 --> 04:59.276
FRASIER: As a rule I'm terribly
nervous hosting these things,

04:59.447 --> 05:01.278
but it seems to be going well,
doesn't it?

05:01.447 --> 05:04.803
Not for me. I haven't made
inroads with a single woman here.

05:06.287 --> 05:07.515
Ooh! Ooh!

05:08.527 --> 05:10.404
What are you doing?
You look nauseated.

05:10.567 --> 05:13.877
That woman is flirting with me.
This is my "I'm available" face.

05:15.967 --> 05:19.164
Well, stop it. My God,
people will think the shrimp are bad.

05:20.887 --> 05:22.878
- All right, which one?
- At 9 o'clock

05:23.047 --> 05:25.197
blond hair, blue dress.
Now 10 o'clock, 11 o'clock.

05:25.367 --> 05:28.006
- Oh, mama, high noon.
- Oh, dear.

05:28.167 --> 05:29.486
I'm sorry, I have to leave early.

05:29.647 --> 05:31.717
I wanted to let you know
what a lovely time I've had.

05:31.887 --> 05:34.321
Well, thank you, Adair.
It was good to see you.

05:34.487 --> 05:37.047
Adair Peck, my brother,
Dr Niles Crane.

05:37.207 --> 05:39.562
- Enchanted.
- Hi.

05:39.727 --> 05:41.285
Are you feeling okay?

05:42.367 --> 05:44.278
Bad shrimp.

05:47.527 --> 05:49.677
I so enjoyed our chat
about Brecht.

05:49.847 --> 05:51.678
I'm just sorry
we didn't get to finish it.

05:51.847 --> 05:53.519
Well, me too.

05:53.967 --> 05:58.404
I never do this, but if you'd like to
give me a call sometime, I'd like that.

05:58.567 --> 06:00.364
You don't have to call me.
Only if you want to.

06:00.527 --> 06:03.087
And we can talk
about other non-Brecht things.

06:03.247 --> 06:05.317
- Of course.
- You see why I never do this.

06:05.487 --> 06:07.921
Well, I'm certainly glad
that you did it with me.

06:08.407 --> 06:10.875
Nice meeting you, Miles.

06:16.607 --> 06:17.926
Dr Crane.

06:18.407 --> 06:20.796
Who's that gentleman over there?

06:21.247 --> 06:23.841
That's Matthew Pinnick, one of
the theatre's biggest benefactors.

06:24.007 --> 06:25.963
Well, I just caught him
back in my bedroom.

06:26.127 --> 06:28.197
Well, I'm sure he just
wandered in there by mistake.

06:28.367 --> 06:30.358
He was trying on my shoes.

06:33.687 --> 06:35.006
[INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE]

06:37.727 --> 06:39.524
An interesting piece of information.

06:39.687 --> 06:42.406
Something tells me the theatre's
going to get that new sound system.

06:42.567 --> 06:44.046
KIMBERLY:
Excuse me.

06:44.247 --> 06:47.045
On behalf of the
Seattle Theatre Ensemble,

06:47.207 --> 06:51.041
I would like to thank Dr Frasier
Crane for hosting tonight's benefit.

06:51.207 --> 06:52.845
But before we say good night,

06:53.007 --> 06:56.363
let's try and coax him
into saying a few words.

07:00.247 --> 07:01.965
All right.

07:06.007 --> 07:08.077
Alexander Pope

07:08.287 --> 07:10.084
once wrote...

07:10.847 --> 07:16.126
...that the theatre aspires to wake
the soul by tender strokes of art.

07:16.287 --> 07:18.164
To raise the genius,

07:18.327 --> 07:20.158
and to mend the heart.

07:21.247 --> 07:24.000
I'd like to say that it's my privilege
to help ensure

07:24.167 --> 07:26.681
the survival
of this noble calling.

07:26.887 --> 07:29.321
And, well, thank you all for coming.

07:29.487 --> 07:32.479
<i>And I'll see you opening night
of Run For Your Wife.</i>

07:39.607 --> 07:41.723
Wow, that was terrific.
Are you always this eloquent?

07:41.887 --> 07:43.639
Oh, well, hardly.

07:43.807 --> 07:46.719
My muse, alas,
is somewhat ephemeral.

07:46.887 --> 07:48.559
Well, it sounds
pretty reliable to me.

07:48.727 --> 07:51.002
- Leslie Wellman. We met earlier.
- Leslie. Of course, yes.

07:51.167 --> 07:54.204
Well, I have to run, but...
I hope I'm not being too forward.

07:54.367 --> 07:56.119
I'd love it if you'd give
me a call sometime.

07:56.287 --> 07:58.118
I'd be delighted to.

07:58.287 --> 08:00.721
- Here's my card.
- Thank you.

08:08.087 --> 08:10.157
Was that Natalie Spencer
I just saw you talking with?

08:10.327 --> 08:11.760
As a matter of fact, it was.

08:11.927 --> 08:14.680
I've been admiring her all evening,
so I steeled myself and asked her

08:14.847 --> 08:16.360
- if she might be free next week.
- And?

08:16.527 --> 08:20.998
Well, her lips said, "No."
But her eyes said, "Read my lips."

08:26.287 --> 08:28.005
I suppose you've
come over here to gloat

08:28.167 --> 08:30.158
- because a woman came on to you.
- Oh, no, hardly.

08:30.327 --> 08:31.646
I wouldn't do that sort of thing.

08:31.807 --> 08:34.321
I came over to gloat because
two women came on to me.

08:35.807 --> 08:36.796
Two?

08:36.967 --> 08:39.241
My God, I've never had a night
like this in my entire life.

08:39.407 --> 08:42.205
I'm a babe magnet. I'm catnip.

08:44.047 --> 08:45.685
I think I feel a fur ball coming up.

08:47.487 --> 08:49.955
Tell me your second conquest
wasn't that haughty filly

08:50.127 --> 08:52.721
- in the white dress, Kimberly Egan?
- No, no, your path is clear.

08:52.887 --> 08:55.196
Oh, what's the point?

08:55.367 --> 08:57.437
I can't take another rejection.

08:57.607 --> 08:59.518
Well, Niles, tell you what.

08:59.687 --> 09:02.884
Seeing as how Cupid has so amply
stocked my quiver this evening,

09:03.047 --> 09:04.605
I will try a shot on your behalf.

09:05.247 --> 09:06.805
Oh, God, you're unbearable.

09:09.767 --> 09:11.166
Excuse me.
Kimberly, good evening.

09:11.327 --> 09:13.283
Oh, Frasier,
thank you again for tonight.

09:13.447 --> 09:15.961
- You really are a wonderful host.
- Oh, thank you.

09:16.127 --> 09:17.879
Listen, I don't usually
do this sort of thing,

09:18.047 --> 09:21.562
but there's a gentleman here tonight
who's, well, rather taken with you.

09:21.727 --> 09:26.437
He's a... An eligible doctor,
and he's a bit shy about coming over

09:26.607 --> 09:28.677
and expressing
those interests to you.

09:28.847 --> 09:31.281
Oh, that is so sweet.

09:31.447 --> 09:35.679
Well, you tell your bashful
friend he needn't be so coy.

09:35.847 --> 09:38.407
I'd love to go out
with you sometime, Frasier.

09:44.047 --> 09:45.526
Call me tomorrow.

09:45.687 --> 09:48.485
- Oh, do you know my brother?
- Oh, of course I do.

09:48.647 --> 09:50.603
Nice seeing you again, Miles.

09:57.847 --> 10:01.396
<i>MAN: Anyway, Dr Crane, I've spent
months now sending out resumes,</i>

10:01.567 --> 10:03.205
<i>pounding the pavement,
but nothing.</i>

10:03.367 --> 10:06.359
Well, Doug, it's possible
you're simply going through a dry spell.

10:06.527 --> 10:08.006
You know, it happens to all of us.

10:08.167 --> 10:10.476
Months go by with nothing.
Then completely out of the blue,

10:10.647 --> 10:14.720
you get not one, but three offers
without doing anything.

10:14.967 --> 10:16.798
Not just for any jobs either,
but desirable ones

10:16.967 --> 10:20.357
with ample salaries
and fabulous perks.

10:21.287 --> 10:24.962
Be patient. Finding employment
is much like dating.

10:25.127 --> 10:27.800
Opportunities come along
when you least expect them.

10:28.527 --> 10:31.121
<i>Thanks, Dr Crane.
Actually, dating's the one area</i>

10:31.287 --> 10:32.686
<i>I don't have any problems in.</i>

10:33.007 --> 10:35.202
<i>Right now, I've got two
women interested in me.</i>

10:35.367 --> 10:38.200
Two? Well, that must make
you the envy of...

10:38.367 --> 10:40.244
...most men.

10:41.527 --> 10:46.396
Well, that's all for today, Seattle.
This is Dr Frasier Crane, KACL 780.

it is a three-day weekend.

I'd say someone was jealous.

After this weekend, you may
have to give up your dating crown.

rotate anything after that.

It's a bit unusual,
but sweet nonetheless.

Okay. What if the wedding
gift happens to be

Listen. Thanks for listening.

32:10.927 --> 32:12.406
- No problem.
- Anytime.

32:12.567 --> 32:17.277
You know, I really thought
I hit the jackpot with Marty.

32:17.687 --> 32:21.885
It isn't easy finding someone
you think the world of.

32:22.047 --> 32:26.199
Oh, I know, you go tomcatting around
with a different girl every night,

32:26.367 --> 32:28.961
but you can't find
happiness that way.

32:29.687 --> 32:31.359
I haven't so far.

32:36.967 --> 32:38.559
Ow!

32:39.847 --> 32:42.600
- I didn't kick you that hard.
- You didn't have to kick me at all.

32:42.767 --> 32:44.598
Were you seriously
considering playing therapist

32:44.767 --> 32:46.519
to Dad and that woman
after we got rid of her?

32:46.687 --> 32:48.484
I have no intention
of repairing the rift.

32:48.647 --> 32:51.605
God. But last night
for the first time in months,

32:51.767 --> 32:53.325
I wasn't jolted awake at 2 a.m.

32:53.487 --> 32:56.126
By her rousing rendition
of "Foggy Mountain Breakdown."

32:58.447 --> 33:01.041
It seems a little odd
that Dad chose to break up

33:01.207 --> 33:03.323
with Sherry just after
he told her that he loved her.

33:03.487 --> 33:06.445
As I recall, she said
he hesitantly said it back to her.

33:06.607 --> 33:09.041
That's a clear picture of a man
who didn't share her feelings.

33:09.207 --> 33:11.163
Yes, well, I think
he does share her feelings.

33:11.567 --> 33:13.762
- He just panicked out of fear.
- Fear of what?

33:13.927 --> 33:16.566
Well, lots of things.
Change. Commitment.

33:17.047 --> 33:18.958
Becoming vulnerable
to somebody again.

33:20.647 --> 33:22.877
I'm afraid he broke up
with her for all the wrong reasons.

33:23.047 --> 33:26.164
Well, if he'd like a list of the right
reasons, it's available on request.

33:27.487 --> 33:29.125
The least I can do
is have a talk with him.

33:29.287 --> 33:31.039
No, the least
you can do is nothing.

33:31.207 --> 33:34.005
Dad hasn't asked for our help.
We should let nature take its course.

33:34.167 --> 33:37.364
It's like one of those wildlife films
with the lion chasing the antelope.

33:37.527 --> 33:41.122
You don't ask why the photographer
doesn't interfere. You just accept it.

33:41.967 --> 33:43.366
As a general rule, Niles,

33:43.527 --> 33:45.722
the photographer
is not related to the antelope.

33:46.367 --> 33:48.517
Obviously, you and I don't
see eye-to-eye on this issue.

33:49.247 --> 33:51.602
- Where are you going?
- I have a date in 45 minutes,

33:51.767 --> 33:54.486
and a bleeding antelope sitting
in a Barcalounger in my apartment.

33:57.727 --> 34:00.639
I suppose that sounded strange
to you. I'd be happy to explain it.

34:00.807 --> 34:03.196
Are you, by any chance,
free at the end of your shift?

34:03.367 --> 34:05.198
Sorry.

34:05.367 --> 34:07.517
I've still got it.

34:22.887 --> 34:25.606
Not so fast, Mr Hicks.

You won't catch me

Daphne.

34:45.687 --> 34:47.005
Hello, Dr Crane.

34:50.447 --> 34:52.641
- Enjoy your evening.
- Yes, you too.

34:53.206 --> 34:56.165
He's been under
a lot of stress lately.

35:00.767 --> 35:02.917
Oh, Dad, listen, I'm glad
you're home. We've gotta talk.

35:03.087 --> 35:04.725
No good conversation
ever started that way.

35:04.887 --> 35:06.320
We have to talk
about you and Sherry.

35:06.487 --> 35:08.239
Why? Look, I'm fine with it.

35:08.407 --> 35:10.363
- Come on, now let it go.
- Dad.

35:10.527 --> 35:11.960
Listen, I spoke with Sherry today.

35:12.127 --> 35:13.606
You did what? What for?

35:13.767 --> 35:15.359
Well, she came to see me.

35:15.527 --> 35:18.246
Said she was a bit confused
about what happened the other day.

35:18.407 --> 35:20.875
Well, from her story,

35:21.047 --> 35:23.402
I think what you're
contending with here

35:23.567 --> 35:26.798
is a classic case of panic
induced by fear of commitment.

35:26.967 --> 35:29.037
You hear that, Eddie?
That's what buys your dog food.

35:29.207 --> 35:32.677
Well, she told me about a little incident
that took place the other evening

35:32.847 --> 35:34.439
where she expressed
her feelings for you,

35:34.607 --> 35:36.563
- and you hesitantly reciprocated.
- Oh, jeez.

35:36.727 --> 35:38.843
She told you about that?
Look, to cut it short,

35:39.007 --> 35:41.282
she told me how she felt about me.
I said it back,

35:41.447 --> 35:43.802
but I only said it
because I felt I had to.

35:43.967 --> 35:45.798
That's not really what I feel.
So end of story.

[DOORBELL RINGS]

Now, there's my date. Listen,
I'm sorry for butting into your life,

35:50.087 --> 35:51.759
but I happen to be
concerned about you.

35:51.927 --> 35:53.246
You may find
this hard to believe,

35:53.407 --> 35:55.682
but your welfare happens
to be very important to me.

36:03.607 --> 36:05.484
- Hi, Frasier.
- Sherry.

36:09.007 --> 36:10.645
- Hi, Martin.
- Hey.

36:10.807 --> 36:13.685
You left your Sinatra tape in my car.

36:13.847 --> 36:15.485
Oh, thanks.
I've been looking for that.

36:16.247 --> 36:17.600
Well, here you go.

36:20.567 --> 36:23.320
- Bye.
- So long.

36:24.727 --> 36:26.957
I saw that, Dad.
I saw the way you looked at her.

36:27.127 --> 36:29.436
You can't convince me you
don't feel the same way about her.

36:29.607 --> 36:32.326
Look, I appreciate what you're
doing, Frasier. I really do. But stop!

36:32.487 --> 36:34.125
All right, fine.
It's your life.

36:34.287 --> 36:36.164
I wouldn't interfere.

for a few minutes,

- I think I can straighten this out.
- It didn't look like he wanted you to.

36:42.127 --> 36:44.277
Yes, he's just being
his old stubborn, ornery self.

- You're doing a bad job.

All right, listen. I'm a little
bit confused about something.

38:49.527 --> 38:50.880
Maybe you can help
me understand it.

You say you don't have any
feelings for this woman.

you've been happier than you've been

- since Mom died?
- You leave your mother out of this.

- I didn't mean to bring her into it.
- Well, good.

39:02.287 --> 39:04.517
Dad, is that what
this is about? Mom?

39:04.687 --> 39:06.678
- No. All right?
- Listen, I'm a psychiatrist...

I don't need a psychiatrist,
and I don't need your help.

- Would you just drop it?

39:11.887 --> 39:13.400
- No, I won't drop it.
- I said drop it!

I have a feeling that what
you're going through here is

39:28.007 --> 39:30.760
feelings of guilt.
It's probably natural to feel that way.

39:30.927 --> 39:32.918
My God, I understand
what you're going through.

39:33.087 --> 39:35.965
No, you don't. No, you don't.
You don't understand at all.

39:37.007 --> 39:39.567
When you've been married
for 35 years,

39:40.047 --> 39:42.766
you'd never thought
there'd be anybody else.

39:43.607 --> 39:47.395
Then one day you hear yourself say,
"I love you," to another woman.

39:48.367 --> 39:51.518
Well, maybe then you'll understand
what I'm going through.

39:55.087 --> 39:58.477
Dad, there was a time back when
my first marriage was breaking up.

39:58.647 --> 40:00.046
I was talking to Mom.

40:00.207 --> 40:02.437
She said, "You've gotta promise
you're not gonna give up."

40:02.607 --> 40:04.882
I said, "The last thing I
wanna hear is a bunch of clichës

40:05.047 --> 40:07.436
about how we're all put on this
Earth to love one another,

40:07.607 --> 40:10.599
and how it's certainly possible for the
heart to love more than one person."

40:11.207 --> 40:13.038
I said, "All right, Mom,
give me one good reason

40:13.207 --> 40:15.960
for me to ever let myself
fall in love again."

40:16.247 --> 40:18.317
She said, "Because I said so,
and I'm your mother."

40:23.207 --> 40:26.279
Yeah, it sure doesn't help reminding
me what a great lady she was.

40:26.447 --> 40:27.721
Well,

40:27.887 --> 40:30.924
does it help to remind you that
Sherry's a pretty great lady too?

40:31.967 --> 40:34.435
God, Dad, she makes you happy.

40:35.367 --> 40:38.245
Niles and I would give anything
to have what you have.

40:38.607 --> 40:41.405
Well, not what you have
but what you have.

40:43.967 --> 40:46.162
Yeah, she is a pretty great lady,
isn't she?

40:47.007 --> 40:49.999
I don't know.
She'd probably be better off

40:50.167 --> 40:52.727
with some guy who wasn't
going through all this stuff.

40:52.887 --> 40:55.162
Well, don't you think you
ought to let her decide that?

41:36.647 --> 41:38.285
Not that I'm averse
to that, of course.

for a nightgown.

41:42.247 --> 41:43.965
Nightcap.

Yes.

41:48.767 --> 41:51.918
Gee, I can't thank you enough for
being tolerant about the time delay.

LESLIE: Oh, no problem.
- Look, you'd be surprised.

41:54.847 --> 41:58.157
I mean, lately women just fly
into rages of intolerance

41:58.327 --> 42:01.285
just at the slightest provocation.
Well, shall we?

42:01.447 --> 42:03.915
Wait, Leslie, before you go,
I want to say something.

42:04.087 --> 42:06.396
Oh, good Lord. Step lively.

42:07.047 --> 42:11.404
Listen, you are a lucky girl to be
with someone as sweet as Frasier.

42:11.567 --> 42:14.286
He just did a real nice thing
for his dad and me.

42:14.767 --> 42:16.041
Thank you, Sherry.

42:16.207 --> 42:17.720
Off we go.

- No.

42:23.567 --> 42:25.239
Don't you think the walk
would do them good?

42:25.407 --> 42:28.444
Oh, no, I think it's starting to rain.
Come on, you'll ride with us.
