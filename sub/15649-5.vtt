11:41.409 --> 11:43.285
Heffer:
BUCK, BUCK, BUCK-CAW!

11:43.369 --> 11:45.913
BUCK, BUCK, BUCK-CAW!

11:48.124 --> 11:51.043
{\an5}Rocko:
WELL, IT'S GOOD TO HAVE
THE OLD HEFFER BACK AGAIN.

11:51.127 --> 11:52.169
HOW YOU FEELING?

11:52.253 --> 11:54.588
OKAY, EXCEPT...

11:54.672 --> 11:57.341
THIS SUNBURN ON MY BUTT
IS KILLING ME.

11:59.135 --> 12:01.220
AND SO IS THIS ENTERTAINMENT.

12:01.303 --> 12:03.514
AND HERE IS MY IMPRESSION

12:03.597 --> 12:07.852
OF AN INFLAMED MAN
FLEEING AN AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENT.

12:07.935 --> 12:08.978
(<i> shrieking</i> )

12:09.061 --> 12:11.313
{\an1}WELL, IT MAY
BE BORING, HEFF

12:11.397 --> 12:14.692
BUT IT'S A HECK
OF A LOT SAFER.

12:14.775 --> 12:17.361
{\an1}...BECAUSE THIS IS CONCEPTUAL
AND THERE'S A DOG BARKING.

12:17.445 --> 12:19.989
BONG, BONG, BONG, BONG, BONG.

12:20.072 --> 12:21.157
WHOO!

12:32.001 --> 12:35.754
{\an4}THIS IS FIRB MCGIGGINS, YOUR
FLY IN THE EYE TRAFFIC REPORTER

12:35.838 --> 12:39.008
AND AS USUAL,
IT IS A MESS DOWN THERE.

12:39.091 --> 12:41.218
MIGHT AS WELL
JUST PARK AND WALK.

12:41.302 --> 12:42.887
Man:
Firb, if I may interrupt

12:42.970 --> 12:45.055
WHO IS FLYING THE HELICOPTER
AT THIS MOMENT?

12:45.139 --> 12:47.349
{\an1}WELL, DALE

12:47.433 --> 12:49.018
I, UH,...ER, THAT...

12:49.101 --> 12:52.021
DUH, I...

12:52.104 --> 12:55.649
(<i> shrieking</i> )

12:55.733 --> 12:56.650
(<i> crashing</i> )

12:56.734 --> 12:57.651
{\an1}(<i> static</i> )

12:57.735 --> 13:00.070
AND NOW FOR...
WAIT! THIS JUST IN.

13:00.154 --> 13:04.366
{\an1}COMMUTERS CAN EXPECT LONGER
DELAYS THAN USUAL THIS MORNING

13:04.450 --> 13:08.537
{\an1}DUE TO AN ACCIDENT ON ROUTE ONE
INVOLVING A... HELICOPTER?

13:08.621 --> 13:10.414
I'M GOING TO BE LATE AGAIN.

13:10.498 --> 13:12.708
MR. SMITTY IS GOING TO KILL ME.

13:12.791 --> 13:16.504
OH, COBBLERS,
20 MINUTES TILL 9:00.

13:16.587 --> 13:17.963
I'LL NEVER MAKE IT.

13:18.047 --> 13:21.008
{\an1}WHAT COULD BE CAUSING
ALL THIS TRAFFIC?

13:21.091 --> 13:23.677
EXCUSE ME, OFFICER,
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

13:23.761 --> 13:26.847
{\an1}ONE OF THOSE LITTLE
REFLECTIVE BUMPS CAME UNGLUED.

13:26.931 --> 13:28.933
WE'VE GOT A CREW
WORKING ON IT.

13:29.016 --> 13:32.311
{\an1}UH, ANYONE
GOT ANY GLUE?

13:32.394 --> 13:33.687
WELL, I MADE IT.

13:33.771 --> 13:36.524
NOW, IF I COULD ONLY
FIND A PARKING SPACE.

13:36.607 --> 13:39.693
BONZA! RIGHT OUT IN FRONT.

13:43.822 --> 13:45.866
HEY, I WAS BACKING IN.

13:48.702 --> 13:50.621
OH, MR. SMITTY.

13:50.704 --> 13:52.164
(<i> laughing nervously</i> )

13:52.248 --> 13:53.999
HOW'D YOU GET HERE SO EARLY?

13:54.083 --> 13:55.584
THE TRAFFIC WAS TERRIBLE.

13:55.668 --> 13:56.252
I JUST LIVE NEXT DOOR.

13:56.335 --> 13:59.463
(<i> cackling</i> )

13:59.547 --> 14:02.174
BUT I CAN'T FIND
A PARKING SPACE ANYWHERE.

14:02.258 --> 14:04.009
TRY FIVE BLOCKS OVER

14:04.093 --> 14:07.054
IN THE HIGH CRIME AREA.

14:10.015 --> 14:12.059
(<i> gunfire and screaming</i> )

14:12.142 --> 14:13.018
HOPE MY CAR WILL BE SAFE.

14:22.278 --> 14:23.988
(<i> panting</i> )

14:29.827 --> 14:31.370
(<i> siren wailing</i> )

14:31.453 --> 14:32.746
(<i> bells ringing</i> )

14:32.830 --> 14:34.665
WELL, WELL, WELL.

14:34.748 --> 14:37.167
LATE AGAIN, I SEE.

14:37.251 --> 14:38.669
COME WITH ME!

14:44.383 --> 14:46.218
WHAT IS THIS, HUH?

14:46.302 --> 14:48.178
A CLOCK?

14:48.262 --> 14:50.639
AND WHAT DOES IT TELL US?

14:50.723 --> 14:51.974
HMM?

14:52.057 --> 14:53.058
TIME?

14:53.142 --> 14:55.978
AND HOW DO WE GET A CLOCK, HM?

14:56.061 --> 14:57.146
GO TO A CLOCK STORE?

14:57.229 --> 14:58.314
{\an5}AND?

14:57.229 --> 14:58.314
BUY ONE?

14:58.397 --> 14:59.481
WITH WHAT?

14:59.565 --> 15:00.149
MONEY?

15:00.232 --> 15:01.317
MONEY!

15:01.400 --> 15:02.818
GOOD.

15:02.901 --> 15:05.321
SO, ANY <i> MORON</i>

15:05.404 --> 15:07.698
CAN SEE...

15:07.781 --> 15:10.200
THAT TIME EQUALS...

15:10.284 --> 15:11.327
WHAT?

15:11.410 --> 15:12.870
HUH?

15:12.953 --> 15:13.996
MONEY?

15:14.079 --> 15:15.831
I CAN'T HEAR YOU!

15:15.914 --> 15:17.291
{\an1}MONEY?

15:17.374 --> 15:18.500
HMM?

15:18.584 --> 15:19.627
MONEY, SIR!

15:19.710 --> 15:21.086
TIME IS MONEY!

15:21.170 --> 15:22.588
I HOPE IT WON'T
BE NECESSARY

15:22.671 --> 15:26.759
TO HAVE THIS
LITTLE CHAT AGAIN, HM?

15:26.842 --> 15:28.510
JUST BE ON TIME!

15:31.138 --> 15:33.390
"DON'T EVEN THINK
ABOUT PARKING HERE."

15:35.976 --> 15:36.977
AH HA.

15:37.061 --> 15:38.187
CAUGHT YOU.

15:38.270 --> 15:39.480
OH, NO, OFFICER.

15:39.563 --> 15:41.940
I WAS, UH, THINKING
OF SOMETHING ELSE.

15:42.024 --> 15:43.192
OH, YEAH? WHAT?

15:43.275 --> 15:45.194
UH, WELL, I...

15:45.277 --> 15:46.153
YEAH, RIGHT.

15:46.236 --> 15:47.655
TELL IT TO THE JUDGE.

15:49.782 --> 15:54.370
(<i> yelling unintelligibly</i> )

15:55.663 --> 15:56.538
BONZA.

15:56.622 --> 15:57.915
A PARKING PLACE.

15:57.998 --> 16:00.209
IT'S GOING TO BE A GREAT DAY.

16:00.292 --> 16:02.920
(<i> whistling</i> )

16:17.309 --> 16:18.560
IT'S FOR YOU, ROCKO.

16:18.644 --> 16:19.978
IT'S YOUR CAR.

16:20.062 --> 16:21.021
{\an3}MY CAR?

16:21.313 --> 16:22.147
UH...

16:22.231 --> 16:24.483
HELLO?

16:24.566 --> 16:25.609
ROCKO, I'VE BEEN IMPOUNDED.

16:25.693 --> 16:28.654
YOU GOT TO COME BAIL ME OUT.

16:28.737 --> 16:30.989
(<i> laughing</i> )

16:31.073 --> 16:32.032
HURRY!

16:33.826 --> 16:36.954
{\an1}I'VE COME DOWN
TO BAIL OUT MY CAR.

16:37.037 --> 16:38.205
IT'S THAT RED ONE.

16:38.288 --> 16:40.874
THE OTHER CARS
CALL HIM "PANTYFENDERS."

16:40.958 --> 16:42.960
TERM OF ENDEARMENT, I'M SURE.

16:43.043 --> 16:43.919
HM.

16:44.002 --> 16:45.254
NOW, LET'S SEE.

16:45.337 --> 16:47.589
5 x 42, CARRY THE FOUR

16:47.673 --> 16:49.717
THAT'LL BE $4,700.

16:49.800 --> 16:50.801
BUT I DON'T HAVE $4,700.

16:50.884 --> 16:53.929
THEN HE'LL HAVE TO REMAIN HERE

16:54.012 --> 16:57.266
UNTIL HE'S PAID
HIS DEBT TO SOCIETY.

16:57.349 --> 16:58.475
DON'T WORRY, CAR.

16:58.559 --> 17:01.228
{\an1}I'LL SAVE SOME MONEY
AND GET YOU OUT.

17:01.311 --> 17:04.272
Heffer:
GEE, ROCKO, THEY TOWED YOUR CAR?

17:04.356 --> 17:05.607
I NEED TO EARN
MONEY TO GET HIM OUT.

17:05.691 --> 17:07.483
BUT IF I KEEP
SHOWING UP LATE

17:07.568 --> 17:09.944
MR. SMITTY WILL FIRE ME.

17:10.028 --> 17:10.904
IF YOU DON'T HAVE A CAR

17:10.988 --> 17:13.866
THAT MEANS
IN ORDER TO GET TO WORK...

17:13.949 --> 17:18.119
YEAH, HEFF, IT MEANS
I'LL HAVE TO TRY...

17:18.203 --> 17:21.415
{\an1}(<i> dramatically</i> ):
PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION.

17:31.508 --> 17:32.468
{\an1}WHERE TO?

17:32.551 --> 17:34.303
{\an3}UH...

17:34.386 --> 17:36.388
(<i> coughing</i> )

17:36.472 --> 17:37.806
(<i> hacking</i> )

17:37.890 --> 17:38.640
KIND OF A-LOT-O COMICS.

17:38.724 --> 17:42.561
SECOND AND 35th.

17:42.644 --> 17:44.188
HEY, READ SIGN.

17:44.271 --> 17:45.522
NO BARFING.

17:48.734 --> 17:49.985
{\an1}YOU KNOW, YOU LOOK
LIKE A NICE BOY.

17:50.068 --> 17:53.822
{\an1}KIND OF LIKE MY SON,
EXCEPT HE HAS NO MONEY.

17:53.906 --> 17:55.657
HEY, GET OUT OF THE WAY!

17:55.741 --> 17:59.077
{\an1}ALWAYS, "DAD, GIVE ME MONEY,
DAD GIVE ME MONEY.

17:59.161 --> 18:01.121
"GIVE ME, GIVE ME, GIVE ME.

18:01.205 --> 18:02.831
WANT, WANT, WANT."

18:02.915 --> 18:05.834
YOU, YOU LOOK LIKE THAT MAN.

18:05.918 --> 18:08.420
ACTUALLY, UH,
I DON'T HAVE MUCH MONEY.

18:08.504 --> 18:11.256
IN FACT, I WAS WONDERING HOW
FAR $2 WOULD GET ME?

18:15.260 --> 18:17.179
UH, WITH TIP?

18:20.182 --> 18:20.474
YOU PAY VERY QUICKLY.

18:20.557 --> 18:22.392
UH, UH...

18:22.476 --> 18:24.686
HERE YOU GO.

18:24.770 --> 18:28.857
UM, WOULD YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW..

18:29.733 --> 18:30.692
THE BUS SCHEDULE...

18:30.776 --> 18:32.402
WOULD YOU...?

18:44.498 --> 18:47.251
(<i> Rocko screaming</i> )

18:55.801 --> 18:57.261
(<i> snoring</i> )

18:59.763 --> 19:01.557
HELLO, EXCUSE ME.

19:01.640 --> 19:03.642
UH, EXCUSE ME.

19:03.725 --> 19:04.643
EXCUSE ME, PLEASE.

19:04.726 --> 19:06.395
EXCUSE ME, EXCUSE ME

19:06.478 --> 19:08.397
EXCUSE ME, EXCUSE ME,
EXCUSE ME, EXCUSE ME.

19:12.150 --> 19:13.819
(<i> screaming</i> )

19:39.428 --> 19:43.182
{\an4}Woman (<i> on loudspeaker</i> ):
Ladies and gentlemen,
we're sorry for the delay

19:43.265 --> 19:46.351
{\an1}but the train has stopped
due to police activity.

19:46.435 --> 19:47.352
POLICE ACTIVITY?

19:47.436 --> 19:49.438
and today's
police activity is...

19:49.521 --> 19:49.938
arts and crafts.

19:50.022 --> 19:51.899
(<i> horn blowing</i> )

19:51.982 --> 19:54.526
HEY, I'M
PAINTING EGGS HERE.

19:55.611 --> 19:59.698
{\an5}YOU KNOW, SINCE
I GOT LAID OFF
FROM THE POST OFFICE

19:59.781 --> 20:02.784
I'VE BEEN FEELING
A LITTLE... HMM...

20:02.868 --> 20:05.245
DISGRUNTLED.

20:06.705 --> 20:07.956
WHOO, WHEE!

20:08.040 --> 20:10.417
NOW I GOT SOME SWINGING ROOM.

20:20.260 --> 20:22.387
(<i> dog barking</i> )

20:26.642 --> 20:28.977
(<i> screaming</i> )

20:33.023 --> 20:34.358
(<i> dog snarling</i> )

20:39.905 --> 20:40.948
I CAN EXPLAIN.

20:41.031 --> 20:43.742
I HAVE TOLERATED YOUR TARDINESS
FOR THE LAST TIME.

20:43.825 --> 20:45.619
IF YOU ARE LATE AGAIN

20:45.702 --> 20:48.956
CONSIDER YOURSELF

20:49.039 --> 20:50.749
TERMINATED!

20:50.832 --> 20:51.792
CLEAR?

20:51.875 --> 20:53.669
CRYSTAL.

20:53.752 --> 20:56.546
{\an1}I'VE GOT TO FIND A WAY
TO GET TO WORK EARLIER, HEFF

20:56.630 --> 20:59.508
OR MR. SMITTY'S GOING
TO GIVE ME THE SACK.

20:59.591 --> 21:00.717
IF I LOSE MY JOB

21:00.801 --> 21:02.844
I'LL NEVER SAVE ENOUGH MONEY
TO GET MY CAR OUT.

21:02.928 --> 21:06.556
I WONDER HOW HE'S DOING.

21:06.640 --> 21:09.393
WE NEED A NEW WAY
TO GET YOU TO WORK.

21:09.476 --> 21:11.770
{\an1}PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION
IS SO DANGEROUS.

21:11.853 --> 21:15.440
{\an1}I THINK IT WOULD BE A LOT SAFER
TO GET SHOT OUT OF A CANNON.

21:15.524 --> 21:16.984
OH!

21:17.067 --> 21:17.776
I GOT IT!

21:17.859 --> 21:20.153
I DON'T KNOW, HEFF.

21:20.237 --> 21:20.862
THIS IS A BIT DRASTIC.

21:20.946 --> 21:23.323
NO, IT'LL WORK, ROCKO.

21:23.407 --> 21:26.243
HERE, PRETEND
YOU'RE THIS WATERMELON.

21:26.326 --> 21:29.454
WE JUST PUT YOU IN THIS END

21:29.538 --> 21:32.040
JUST AIM IT
AT THE COMIC SHOP

21:32.124 --> 21:33.208
{\an3}AND...

21:39.172 --> 21:42.092
OF COURSE, YOU'LL
BE WEARING A HELMET.

21:46.221 --> 21:49.975
OH, OH, GOSH, OH, OH, OW...

21:50.058 --> 21:51.435
HMM...

21:54.813 --> 21:56.606
ONE MINUTE TILL 9:00!

21:56.690 --> 21:58.233
I CAN STILL MAKE IT!

21:58.317 --> 22:01.403
(<i> watch ticking</i> )

22:08.076 --> 22:11.413
(<i> screaming and crashing</i> )

22:15.709 --> 22:17.919
OH, GOOD MORNING, MR. SMITTY.

22:18.003 --> 22:18.920
AM I ON TIME?

22:19.004 --> 22:21.256
ACTUALLY, YOU ARE ON TIME.

22:21.339 --> 22:24.426
ON TIME TO BE...

22:24.509 --> 22:26.845
FIRED!

22:28.930 --> 22:32.100
{\an1}WITHOUT A JOB, I WON'T
BE ABLE TO GET MY CAR OUT.

22:32.184 --> 22:35.312
AND HE WAS COUNTING ON ME, TOO.

22:35.395 --> 22:37.355
SIR, I COULDN'T
HELP BUT OVERHEAR.

22:37.439 --> 22:38.440
IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR WORK

22:38.523 --> 22:42.027
{\an1}I KNOW OF A JOB THAT
WOULD BE RIGHT UP YOUR ALLEY.

22:42.110 --> 22:43.236
REALLY?

22:43.320 --> 22:45.614
YOU GOING TO BUY THAT OR WHAT?

22:45.697 --> 22:48.158
HEY, THAT'S MY CAR!

22:48.241 --> 22:50.368
MY CAR!

22:50.452 --> 22:52.120
ROCKO?

22:52.204 --> 22:53.205
HI, MR. SMITTY.

22:53.288 --> 22:54.581
I'VE GOT A NEW JOB.

22:54.664 --> 22:57.334
{\an1}AND YOU'VE PARKED
IN A NEW TOW-AWAY ZONE.

22:57.417 --> 22:59.836
{\an1}BUT, BUT, BUT, BUT,
BUT, BUT...

22:59.920 --> 23:02.339
YOU CAN PICK IT UP
AT THE IMPOUND LOT.

23:02.422 --> 23:04.216
WELL, THAT'S THE LAST ONE.

23:04.299 --> 23:06.676
YOU'VE MADE ENOUGH TO GET
YOUR CAR OUT OF IMPOUND.

23:06.760 --> 23:09.179
ROCKO!

23:09.262 --> 23:10.472
CAR!

23:10.555 --> 23:13.141
YOU SURE WE CAN'T
PERSUADE YOU TO STAY?

23:13.225 --> 23:14.101
NO THANKS.

23:14.184 --> 23:16.228
MY WORK HERE IS FINISHED.

23:16.311 --> 23:19.397
{\an1}THIS IS YOUR EYE IN THE SKY,
BACK FROM THE HOSPITAL

23:19.481 --> 23:22.400
{\an1}AND MONTHS OF PAINFUL
REHABILITATIVE THERAPY.

23:22.484 --> 23:24.319
LIGHTER COMMUTE THIS MORNING.

23:24.402 --> 23:26.822
THERE IS HARDLY
ANYONE ON THE ROAD.

23:26.905 --> 23:30.784
{\an1}BUT IT'S A DIFFERENT STORY
OVER AT THE IMPOUND LOT.
