00:33.458 --> 00:35.824
Staff! Man fainted!

02:28.940 --> 02:31.807
Morning, sir. Heat exhaustion.

02:38.149 --> 02:40.310
We're expecting a new lot of prisoners in,
aren't we?

02:40.385 --> 02:43.218
I've five listed, sir,
but we can get a lot more.

02:43.922 --> 02:45.981
- Can we?
- The new push has started.

02:46.057 --> 02:49.993
Soon as there's a bit of action, the bloody
layabouts are begging to get in here.

02:50.061 --> 02:53.724
I've a special coming in, sir,
a broken sergeant major.

02:53.932 --> 02:56.230
What, Roberts? So they found him guilty?

02:56.301 --> 02:58.769
Wasn't no doubt about that,
was there, sir?

02:58.836 --> 03:01.396
- I suppose not.
- I want him fit, sir.

03:01.606 --> 03:04.507
If he's fit, you'll get him, Sergeant Major.

03:05.543 --> 03:07.135
I want him, sir.

03:27.966 --> 03:33.871
One, two, three, four. One, two...

03:34.105 --> 03:36.266
- Morning, Harris.
- Morning, sir.

03:36.341 --> 03:38.241
- You the new staff?
- Yes, sir.

03:42.213 --> 03:44.340
- Name, Staff?
- Staff Williams, sir.

03:45.783 --> 03:47.444
- Staff!
- Sir.

03:47.518 --> 03:49.679
You gonna keep them line dodgers
idling all day?

03:49.754 --> 03:51.585
Sir. Attention!

03:54.359 --> 03:57.123
- Worked in the civvy jails, haven't you?
- Yes, sir.

03:57.195 --> 03:58.890
- And Aldershot?
- Yes, sir.

03:58.963 --> 04:01.193
Why give up the comforts of civvy life?

04:01.265 --> 04:05.634
- I wanted overseas, sir.
- Jerry bombed the scrubs. Is that right?

04:06.104 --> 04:09.005
- Yes, sir.
- Then you'll like it here.

04:09.273 --> 04:11.673
Nice and peaceful, isn't it, Staff Harris?

04:11.743 --> 04:14.041
I'll do my job anywhere I'm sent, sir.

04:14.278 --> 04:15.506
Enjoy prison work?

04:15.580 --> 04:18.048
- Fancy I'm the right man for the job, sir.
- Do you?

04:18.116 --> 04:20.380
Staff Harris here don't reckon himself
as a man with a mission.

04:20.451 --> 04:22.442
- Is that right, Harris?
- Well, there's other jobs.

04:22.520 --> 04:24.351
They can still use men up front, sir.

04:24.422 --> 04:26.185
Then why the hell
didn't you join the commandos?

04:26.257 --> 04:27.281
No, all I meant was...

04:27.358 --> 04:30.885
I've done 25 years. Where the hell
do you think I'd like to be, right now?

04:30.962 --> 04:34.022
Nobody's gonna pin a medal on us,
but get this straight,

04:34.098 --> 04:37.033
one job's as important as the next.

04:37.602 --> 04:38.967
- Is that clear?
- Sir.

04:39.037 --> 04:40.698
Two prisoners for release, sir!

04:40.772 --> 04:42.296
- Double them over here!
- Pick 'em up there!

04:42.373 --> 04:44.739
Left, right, right turn,

04:45.076 --> 04:47.670
left, right, left, right, left, right. Mark time!

04:47.812 --> 04:49.746
- Carry on, Gate.
- Sir.

04:49.814 --> 04:53.750
About turn. Right turn.

04:54.619 --> 04:58.111
- Keep them knees up. Keep them up.
- Halt! One, one, two.

04:59.557 --> 05:02.890
Right. Let's have your names. You?

05:02.994 --> 05:06.452
- 743, Walters, sir.
- Put your kit bag down. You?

05:06.564 --> 05:09.362
- 158, Martin, sir.
- Put your kit down.

05:10.935 --> 05:12.698
- Due for release, eh?
- Yes, sir.

05:12.770 --> 05:15.238
- What were you in for, Martin?
- Went absent, sir.

05:15.306 --> 05:16.796
- You, Walters?
- Went absent, sir.

05:16.874 --> 05:17.966
Be going absent again?

05:18.042 --> 05:19.532
- No, sir.
- No, sir.

05:20.211 --> 05:22.145
When they came to me,
they were on the run.

05:22.213 --> 05:24.340
- Living it up in Cairo, wasn't it?
- Yes, sir.

05:24.415 --> 05:25.905
Living with a couple of cabaret bints.

05:25.983 --> 05:28.781
Very tough they was,
considering they was pimps.

05:29.320 --> 05:32.118
Wasn't going to do nothing I told them,
was you? Well, speak up.

05:32.190 --> 05:34.317
We sort of thought like that, sir.

05:35.059 --> 05:37.619
Any complaints about any members
of my staff?

05:37.728 --> 05:39.320
- No, sir.
- Glad of that.

05:39.630 --> 05:42.463
We've treated you well,
better than you deserve.

05:43.067 --> 05:48.630
You look better and you smell sweeter.
Gave you both hell, didn't I?

05:49.707 --> 05:51.197
- No, sir.
- Could have been worse, sir.

05:51.275 --> 05:54.836
Who told you to make a speech?
You know why I made you suffer?

05:56.013 --> 05:58.379
To find out if there's any good in you.

05:58.883 --> 06:01.408
You hurt yourself, lads, trying to beat me.

06:01.886 --> 06:06.380
You take the hill, the pack drill, the lot,
and learn about discipline the hard way.

06:06.624 --> 06:11.425
I've doubled in thousands like you, the
dregs, the dross, the filth of the gutters.

06:12.396 --> 06:18.028
But when I've doubled them out,
they've turned out like you two, like men.

06:20.605 --> 06:25.508
And a credit to the uniform.
Right, pick up your kits.

06:27.378 --> 06:28.845
About turn!

06:30.481 --> 06:34.440
Double march.
Left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right,

06:34.519 --> 06:37.147
left, right, left, right, left, right.

06:46.831 --> 06:48.162
On the double!

07:06.184 --> 07:07.708
- Staff.
- Sir.

07:07.785 --> 07:10.049
You got room in B Wing for five prisoners?

07:10.121 --> 07:13.522
- Yes, sir.
- All in one cell. Fix it.

07:14.392 --> 07:17.589
- Sir, I will.
- New scum and old scum are bad mixers.

07:17.662 --> 07:19.721
I'll assign Staff Williams to you, Harris.

07:19.797 --> 07:22.027
He can cut his teeth on this new lot.

07:22.567 --> 07:26.503
Left, right, left, right,
right wheel, mark time.

07:26.571 --> 07:28.004
- Fix it.
- Sir.

07:28.072 --> 07:29.061
Halt!

07:29.440 --> 07:32.273
- A new intake of prisoners, sir.
- Sweat them down.

07:32.476 --> 07:33.943
Double them before you give them to me.

07:34.011 --> 07:35.603
Sir. Double march.

07:35.680 --> 07:40.947
Left, right, left, right, left, right,
left, right, left, right, left, right.

07:43.087 --> 07:47.888
I'm a fair man, Staff. All I ask is that the
prisoners obey orders and at the double.

07:48.092 --> 07:50.583
- Your job is to see that they do.
- Yes, sir.

07:51.662 --> 07:54.358
Every member of my staff's
got my full backing.

07:54.599 --> 07:58.365
There's the Commandant, of course.
The Commandant signs bits of paper.

07:58.736 --> 08:01.762
He'd sign his own death warrant
if I handed it to him, but I run this place.

08:01.839 --> 08:05.935
Get that? The Commandant doesn't like
being troubled with trivialities.

08:06.010 --> 08:09.969
So only take up serious matters with him,
Staff. Like arson or sudden death.

08:10.047 --> 08:12.811
But see me first, always.

08:26.030 --> 08:27.691
Left turn!

08:28.799 --> 08:32.996
Left, right, left, right, mark time. Halt!

08:35.006 --> 08:36.905
- Take over, Staff.
- Sir!

08:37.408 --> 08:41.504
Pick up your dressing.
Come on, look lively!

08:42.212 --> 08:46.240
Stand still! All right, turn out your kit.

08:59.497 --> 09:02.591
Tidy it up. Tidy it up. Tidy it up.

09:04.068 --> 09:06.400
Tidy it up. Tidy it up.

09:07.505 --> 09:08.631
Tidy it up.

09:10.474 --> 09:12.066
Stand still!

09:21.819 --> 09:24.310
- Sir, that's my...
- You will get a receipt.

09:26.857 --> 09:29.917
- Love letters.
- Please, sir, they are my wife's.

09:29.994 --> 09:31.928
Tell it to the Sergeant Major.

09:34.198 --> 09:36.291
Those letters, sir.
Please, they're my wife's.

09:36.367 --> 09:38.562
I'll tell you when to speak.

09:50.715 --> 09:53.411
So that's the way
your bloody mind works, is it?

09:54.285 --> 09:58.187
Thought you'd contaminate His Majesty's
prison with fornicating pictures, did you?

09:58.255 --> 09:59.347
Sir?

09:59.423 --> 10:01.755
Thought we'd let you keep them
for pinups, I suppose.

10:01.826 --> 10:03.521
You dirty-minded animal.

10:04.795 --> 10:06.956
- Staff, what's this?
- Tell it to the Sergeant Major.

10:07.031 --> 10:08.760
- Sergeant Major.
- Shut up.

10:19.543 --> 10:24.242
Staff. Right, let's have your names.

10:25.783 --> 10:28.274
- You?
- 132, Private McGrath, sir.

10:30.121 --> 10:32.021
- You?
- 736, Private King, sir.

10:33.691 --> 10:35.522
929, Private Stevens, sir.

10:36.827 --> 10:39.057
- You?
- 824, Private Bartlett, sir.

10:41.198 --> 10:43.063
421, Trooper Roberts, sir.

10:46.537 --> 10:48.562
- You're Roberts, eh?
- Yes, sir.

11:07.491 --> 11:12.224
My guess is Willie, sir. He is my pal.
I bet he put those postcards in my kit.

11:12.329 --> 11:13.819
He planted them on you?

11:13.898 --> 11:16.833
That's Willie, sir.
Always dropping me in it.

11:18.569 --> 11:21.197
Your charge sheet says you stole
three bottles of whiskey

11:21.272 --> 11:23.001
from the sergeants' mess.

11:24.475 --> 11:27.205
Funny you weren't charged
with being drunk, too.

11:27.478 --> 11:30.038
- My unlucky day, sir.
- I make the jokes here.

11:31.449 --> 11:34.543
When you've served your sentence,
you'll be arrested at the gates

11:34.618 --> 11:38.076
and charged with having
in your possession obscene photographs.

11:39.824 --> 11:44.693
Now you can start laughing. Watch it!
Watch it.

11:53.404 --> 11:58.000
- You stole 10 motor vehicle tires?
- Yes, sir.

11:59.043 --> 12:01.739
- What did you do with them?
- Well, I flogged them, sir.

12:01.812 --> 12:04.110
- To the enemy?
- No, to the wogs.

12:04.281 --> 12:09.514
And what do you call them, your little
friends? Sold them guns, too, have you?

12:09.653 --> 12:12.178
- No, sir.
- You would if you had a chance.

12:13.691 --> 12:16.421
How many times
have you been inside now?

12:18.596 --> 12:19.654
Nine, sir.

12:20.731 --> 12:25.725
Just be about due for your pension, eh?
When did you last see action?

12:26.670 --> 12:30.902
- Action, sir? Let me see...
- You've never seen any.

12:30.975 --> 12:36.072
- Well, I never quite got round to it, sir.
- No. You didn't, did you?

12:36.313 --> 12:38.577
- It's the luck of the game, sir.
- Bartlett.

12:39.917 --> 12:41.214
Let me tell you

12:42.419 --> 12:46.412
that the front line is going to be
a damn sight more comfortable than here.

12:47.424 --> 12:48.550
Understand?

12:53.797 --> 12:56.459
- You're a fighting man, McGrath?
- Yes, sir.

12:56.600 --> 13:00.559
Yeah, I see. You assaulted three members
of the Corps of Military Police.

13:01.472 --> 13:04.873
- Yes, sir.
- Seen any other action, apart from that?

13:05.609 --> 13:08.806
- If you're asking if I'm a coward, sir...
- I'll soon have the answer to that.

13:08.879 --> 13:12.212
Well, I didn't flog tires to the enemy, or
sell dirty postcards on the streets of Cairo.

13:12.283 --> 13:15.343
No, you got boozed up
and tried to obstruct the police.

13:15.819 --> 13:18.686
- I don't need a drink before I...
- Your kind always need a drink.

13:18.756 --> 13:21.748
McGrath, I've a dozen like you inside here.

13:22.359 --> 13:25.021
They all came in here thinking
they were going to run this place.

13:25.095 --> 13:27.825
I've just doubled a couple of them out.

13:32.703 --> 13:35.399
- Went absent, Stevens?
- Yes, sir.

13:36.073 --> 13:39.668
- Didn't fancy the sound of gunfire?
- It wasn't that, sir. I was...

13:40.911 --> 13:42.970
Tried to stow away on a boat
leaving for England.

13:43.047 --> 13:45.607
No, I was trying to get home.
You see, sir, it was because...

13:45.683 --> 13:47.241
Not very smart of you, Stevens.

13:47.318 --> 13:51.448
The smart thing to do is to go
to the airport. Give a Yank 20 quid,

13:51.522 --> 13:53.581
and he'd fly you to Hong Kong
if you wanted it.

13:53.657 --> 13:56.956
- No, it was home I wanted, sir.
- Missing you wife, Stevens?

13:58.228 --> 13:59.695
Yes. Yes, sir.

14:00.164 --> 14:01.597
Every man who wanted a cuddle

14:01.665 --> 14:03.530
and a little bit of loving kindness
took off for England,

14:03.601 --> 14:06.729
there wouldn't be any bloody army
left over here now, would there?

14:06.804 --> 14:10.604
- No, sir.
- You're out of place here, Stevens.

14:13.143 --> 14:16.544
Obey orders. Get out as soon as you can.

14:16.947 --> 14:18.244
Thank you, sir.

14:24.989 --> 14:26.786
- Roberts?
- Sir.

14:28.225 --> 14:31.888
Your commanding officer gave you
an order. He ordered you to fight.

14:32.463 --> 14:35.159
So you knocked his teeth out.
Is that right?

14:35.866 --> 14:37.231
Yes, sir.

14:37.901 --> 14:39.698
Is that all you got to say?

14:42.006 --> 14:44.099
Sir, it's all I want to say.

14:49.947 --> 14:52.916
- See that hill?
- I noticed it as I came in.

14:52.983 --> 14:54.473
We built it special.

14:54.752 --> 14:58.745
A few tons of sand and rock and a lot of
labor and sweat. The prisoners built it.

14:58.822 --> 15:02.053
Well, that's marvelous, sir.
It's a great construction feat.

15:02.526 --> 15:05.120
Something tells me
you're going to get to know it well.

15:05.195 --> 15:08.926
- I don't want any special privileges.
- It gets hot on that hill. Hot.

15:08.999 --> 15:11.559
I fancy I saw snow on the top
when I came in.

15:12.269 --> 15:14.635
You're dead set on having a go at it,
aren't you?

15:14.705 --> 15:18.641
No, I can do without it, sir,
but I think you've got other plans for me.

15:21.812 --> 15:23.177
- King.
- Sir.

15:23.747 --> 15:25.715
Would you like to drill with these men?

15:25.783 --> 15:27.876
Anything you order I can do, sir.

15:28.085 --> 15:32.818
Pity I won't see it.
You can't drill with them. You're black.

15:33.223 --> 15:36.192
- I already know that, sir.
- I only take notice of one thing. The book.

15:36.260 --> 15:39.195
<i>King's Rules and Regulations</i> lay it down
in black and white that Hottentots,

15:39.263 --> 15:42.289
bosutos, voodoo boys and sons of
witch doctors do their square-bashing

15:42.366 --> 15:44.129
separate and away from white men.

15:44.201 --> 15:47.466
- I'm a British subject from the West Indies.
- You're black.

15:47.604 --> 15:49.367
That makes me happy
when I see some white men, sir.

15:49.440 --> 15:52.238
Don't answer back,
you different-colored bastard.

15:52.509 --> 15:54.033
Man, I spit.

15:54.111 --> 15:55.237
- Staff.
- Sir!

15:55.312 --> 15:58.475
Over here. See if the M.O.'s ready
to inspect these men.

15:58.549 --> 15:59.538
Sir!

16:05.789 --> 16:09.384
- So you're a British subject, eh?
- Yes.

16:09.526 --> 16:12.825
- Yes, what?
- Yes, sir.

16:13.464 --> 16:16.228
Then you have equal privileges.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.831
You can drill with these men,

16:19.737 --> 16:22.228
and you can dance
over that hill with them.

16:23.474 --> 16:25.339
Be my pleasure, sir.

16:33.183 --> 16:35.845
Six prisoners present and correct, sir!

16:37.821 --> 16:39.948
Forty-six prisoners, correct, sir!

16:40.858 --> 16:43.554
Sixteen prisoners present and correct, sir!

16:46.363 --> 16:48.331
Fifteen prisoners present and correct, sir!

16:48.398 --> 16:51.458
Eighteen prisoners
all present and correct, sir!

16:57.174 --> 17:00.507
Five new prisoners
all present and correct, sir!

17:04.448 --> 17:07.212
Eighteen prisoners
all present and correct, sir!

17:08.185 --> 17:13.521
Now, if any of you are excused boots, pack
drill, breathing, have six toes, two heads

17:13.589 --> 17:14.989
or a dose of the clap,

17:15.058 --> 17:19.426
are pigeon-chested, walleyed or
still have to be breast fed, speak up now.

17:21.330 --> 17:23.959
That's my set piece
and it always gets a laugh.

17:26.869 --> 17:29.634
- Ready for medical inspection, sir.
- King, fall out.

17:29.706 --> 17:33.802
Double over to the M.O.'s room.
Left, right, left, right, left, right, left.

17:36.880 --> 17:39.678
So you're the busted sergeant major,
are you?

17:51.361 --> 17:56.298
I'll bet your boys loved you.
How many of them died for you, Roberts?

17:58.702 --> 18:00.499
Some of them died fighting.

18:01.038 --> 18:03.131
Don't give me the big hero stuff.

18:04.341 --> 18:08.038
You got busted for cowardice, cowardice!
Eyes front!

18:10.347 --> 18:12.440
Not a swatty in the Middle East
who's not heard about you.

18:12.516 --> 18:16.043
What are you supposed to be?
A brave man in a permanent base job?

18:16.119 --> 18:17.518
Next!

18:18.889 --> 18:21.187
Stevens, fall out and double away,
will you?

18:21.258 --> 18:25.319
Left, right, left, right, get those knees up,
will you? Get them up, up, up!

18:31.535 --> 18:33.435
Medical inspection.

18:35.005 --> 18:38.338
Man, the only place
that crazy doctor inspected...

18:38.408 --> 18:39.739
No talking.

18:39.943 --> 18:43.674
How he gonna know I A-1
by only just looking at my secret weapon?

18:44.781 --> 18:46.578
I told you no talking!

18:46.884 --> 18:48.909
King, Roberts, you're on charge.

18:49.753 --> 18:52.517
- Hey, Staff, he didn't speak.
- Don't answer back.

18:53.557 --> 18:56.526
But, Staff, you charge me.
That man ain't speak.

18:56.593 --> 19:00.586
King, you're a dead cert for bread
and water if you don't stop flapping

19:00.664 --> 19:02.461
that big trap of yours.

19:03.533 --> 19:07.833
- I told you, Staff. He didn't speak.
- Why don't you shut up?

19:08.005 --> 19:09.199
All right, McGrath!

19:09.273 --> 19:11.366
Well, I don't want them two
dropping me in it.

19:11.441 --> 19:13.568
- Next, Staff.
- Yes, sir!

19:15.279 --> 19:17.645
- All right, McGrath, fall out.
- What the hell are you doing, Stevens?

19:17.714 --> 19:19.375
Now cut out this bashful virgin act.

19:19.449 --> 19:21.815
Double it up! Left, right, left, right!

19:22.953 --> 19:23.942
Halt!

19:25.555 --> 19:28.820
Now you two had a great time
of it with the Sergeant Major,

19:30.093 --> 19:32.823
but I'm taking care
of your welfare from now on.

19:33.397 --> 19:37.265
I'll tell you here and now.
I hate the bloody sight of the pair of you.

19:37.834 --> 19:41.736
- Next, Staff!
- Sir! Bartlett, fall out and double over.

19:44.107 --> 19:45.802
All right, move, move, move!

19:46.209 --> 19:48.700
Get your knees up. Get them up.

20:02.726 --> 20:05.354
One of these shy lads, are you, Stevens?

20:07.331 --> 20:08.696
Well?

20:08.765 --> 20:10.027
- Well...
- Well?

20:10.133 --> 20:11.600
- I was...
- You what?

20:12.970 --> 20:16.098
One of these cads who can't make up
his mind whether he's a boy or a girl?

20:16.173 --> 20:18.164
- I'm married, sir.
- Are you now?

20:19.376 --> 20:21.844
And who's who in your little partnership?

20:22.479 --> 20:25.505
We don't have to be treated like that,
do we? I mean...

20:25.649 --> 20:27.776
- Eyes front!
- We're not animals.

20:28.752 --> 20:32.313
Haven't made up my mind
whether you're fish or fowl yet, Stevens.

20:34.992 --> 20:36.152
- Staff!
- Sir.

20:36.360 --> 20:38.123
I want this one scrubbed
with a yard broom.

20:38.195 --> 20:40.629
- He's blacker than a darkie!
- Sir!

20:42.966 --> 20:45.400
- Next, Staff!
- Roberts, double!

20:46.503 --> 20:49.631
- Move it!
- Halt!

20:49.940 --> 20:52.135
Hat off! Inside!

20:56.747 --> 20:59.739
- This is Roberts, sir.
- Take your shirt off.

21:07.691 --> 21:11.855
- Any serious illnesses?
- Do you mean recently, sir?

21:12.229 --> 21:13.594
Anytime.

21:15.198 --> 21:16.859
Smoker's cough.

21:17.734 --> 21:19.292
Drop your trousers.

21:23.940 --> 21:26.340
- Anything else?
- Like what?

21:27.611 --> 21:33.140
- Any recent incapacities?
- Well, I wouldn't brag about it if I had, sir.

21:34.184 --> 21:37.745
Roberts, in this place, it pays to give
a plain answer to a simple question.

21:37.821 --> 21:40.051
Try learning that golden rule.

21:41.758 --> 21:43.316
Turn around.

21:46.063 --> 21:47.758
Right, get dressed.

21:52.002 --> 21:54.869
- Then I'm fit, sir?
- Yes.

21:56.807 --> 21:59.833
Where are you sending me,
to a stud farm?

22:02.245 --> 22:08.309
Roberts, I give you one week,
just one week. Now get out.

22:09.553 --> 22:10.918
- Right now.
- Yes, sir.

22:11.288 --> 22:14.621
About turn. Forward march.
Left, right, left, right.

22:14.958 --> 22:21.454
Attention! Stand at ease!
Attention! Stand at ease!

22:22.165 --> 22:26.397
Attention! Stand at ease! Attention!

22:26.970 --> 22:28.562
- Staff!
- Sir.

22:29.539 --> 22:32.235
I suggest you take the prisoners
on a short excursion.

22:32.309 --> 22:34.004
- Sir.
- To the hill, Staff.

22:34.077 --> 22:37.410
Suggest you take them to the hill.
Let them walk round it.

22:37.981 --> 22:39.812
Inspect it at their leisure.

22:40.350 --> 22:43.945
Then take them up and down it,
say half a dozen times. No more.

22:44.221 --> 22:48.157
Just half a dozen times.
But not Roberts, Staff.

22:48.258 --> 22:50.317
- Not Roberts, sir?
- Not Roberts.

22:51.261 --> 22:55.664
Give him half an hour. That's plenty.
Just half an hour.

22:55.732 --> 22:57.597
- Carry on, Staff.
- Sir.

22:57.834 --> 23:01.702
Detail, pick up your kits.
Move, move, move!

23:02.405 --> 23:03.736
Stand still!

23:04.641 --> 23:07.735
Roberts! You're idle on parade.
You're on another charge.

23:07.811 --> 23:10.644
Remainder, three paces forward, march!

23:11.815 --> 23:15.546
Left turn! By the front, quick march!

23:15.619 --> 23:21.558
Left, right, left, right, left, right!

23:21.625 --> 23:24.025
You're a clever bag of tricks,
you are, Roberts.

23:24.094 --> 23:26.494
Not inside glasshouse half an hour
and you use your bloody influence

23:26.563 --> 23:28.428
to get us a ride on the hill.

23:28.498 --> 23:31.524
Aye. I'll bet there's one Saturday night
booze-up your father's always regretted.

23:31.601 --> 23:33.501
Roberts, are you listening to me?

23:33.570 --> 23:37.506
The ride on the hill leaves any marks
on me, I'll leave a bloody few on you.

23:37.574 --> 23:39.633
Left turn! Stand still!

23:45.682 --> 23:46.774
The hill.

23:49.786 --> 23:51.310
Right turn!

23:52.255 --> 23:57.488
By the front, double march!
Left, right, left, right, left wheel!

23:57.627 --> 24:02.462
Left, right, left. Left, right, left, right, left.
Pick up your step!

24:03.733 --> 24:08.432
Left, right, left, right, left, right,
left, right, left, right, left, right.

24:09.039 --> 24:10.472
Left wheel!

24:13.843 --> 24:18.177
Left, right, left, right, left, right,
left, right, left, right, left wheel!

24:20.183 --> 24:25.416
Left, right, left, right, left, right,
left, right, left, right, left, right.

24:27.557 --> 24:29.889
Left wheel!

24:32.062 --> 24:35.554
Detail, halt! Stand still!

24:39.769 --> 24:41.669
Left turn!

24:43.006 --> 24:47.773
This is the north face, gentlemen.
I mean, ladies and gentlemen. Still!

24:48.845 --> 24:53.305
On a clear day you can see Mother India.
Still patches of snow on the top, Roberts?

24:53.850 --> 24:55.647
Damn funny hill.
Nothing seems to grow on it.

24:55.719 --> 24:57.346
It's full of surprises.

24:58.788 --> 25:00.983
The only thing that's been known
to grow on that hill is soldiers.

25:01.057 --> 25:02.422
They grow weary!

25:03.126 --> 25:08.154
Now we're going to double up it.
By the right! Double march!

25:37.961 --> 25:39.394
About turn!

25:40.363 --> 25:41.352
Double!

25:42.866 --> 25:44.299
About turn!

26:34.818 --> 26:36.285
About turn!

26:39.856 --> 26:41.221
About turn!

26:46.763 --> 26:49.425
Double! Double!

27:42.619 --> 27:43.608
Move it!

27:59.736 --> 28:01.101
Come on. Move it.

28:03.072 --> 28:04.061
Move it.

28:05.775 --> 28:09.370
Stand still. Come on, get fell in.

28:13.917 --> 28:17.614
Pick up your dressing. Stand still!

28:20.190 --> 28:23.626
All right, detail, stand at ease!
Not you, Roberts.

28:26.830 --> 28:30.425
Now take your towels out.
Not you, Roberts.

28:31.835 --> 28:34.235
You're gonna continue doubling, Roberts.

28:36.739 --> 28:38.229
About turn!

28:39.776 --> 28:41.710
Double march!

28:43.580 --> 28:46.913
- Take them away, Staff.
- Left incline. Double march!

28:47.317 --> 28:52.345
Come on, get your knees up.
Left, right, left, right. Halt!

28:55.758 --> 28:59.387
Right. Get your clothes off. Get in.

29:11.207 --> 29:12.231
Double!

29:21.217 --> 29:22.377
Double!

30:06.095 --> 30:12.398
Left, right, left, right, left, right.

30:22.412 --> 30:23.538
Left turn!

30:25.014 --> 30:27.346
Halt! Left turn!

30:28.051 --> 30:31.612
Right, change clothes and lay out your kit,
and be smart about it.

30:34.924 --> 30:36.391
It's filthy.

30:52.008 --> 30:54.203
- Double.
- That's enough, Staff.

30:55.144 --> 30:57.908
- Yes, sir.
- Walk him.

30:59.115 --> 31:02.278
Or lift him.
Put him in the shade and rest him.

31:12.428 --> 31:15.090
My picture got wet. That's my wife.

31:16.232 --> 31:19.998
- And she looks like a very nice girl.
- She is. Jean. That's her name.

31:23.640 --> 31:26.837
- Looks too good for you, Stevens.
- Give us a dekko.

31:27.744 --> 31:29.609
Now go careful. It's still wet.

31:29.679 --> 31:32.773
Lord! I wouldn't mind
half an hour with her, eh?

31:32.849 --> 31:35.647
- Come on. Give it.
- Hold on. Just wanna have a shifty.

31:35.718 --> 31:37.447
What's her legs like? Can't see her legs.

31:37.520 --> 31:38.885
No, come on, give it to me.

31:38.955 --> 31:40.855
What's she got stuck up her jumper?

31:40.923 --> 31:42.823
- Oh, come on.
- Couple of barrage balloons, eh?

31:42.892 --> 31:44.621
She's not a bad old piece, is she?

31:44.694 --> 31:47.561
- Give the photo back.
- All right. All right.

31:49.132 --> 31:52.624
From out here, it sounds like a
monkey house, looks like a monkey house,

31:52.702 --> 31:56.160
smells like a monkey house.
Didn't I tell you to smarten it up?

32:07.650 --> 32:09.811
All right, get your mess tins
and get in the line.

32:09.886 --> 32:11.945
Come on. Put a move on. Move it!

32:12.221 --> 32:15.247
Or by Stephen, you'll suffer.

32:15.925 --> 32:18.223
Come on, come on, come on.

32:19.262 --> 32:20.251
Left turn!

32:20.329 --> 32:24.857
Left! Double march! Left, left, left.
Left wheel.

32:29.172 --> 32:32.005
Right wheel. Key, Staff. Mark time!

32:40.717 --> 32:42.412
What about my grub, then?

32:50.259 --> 32:52.591
Nails, lad! Come on, hold your nails out.

33:02.605 --> 33:05.267
- Ration correct?
- Bread's a bit short, sir.

33:05.341 --> 33:06.638
Weigh it.

33:09.812 --> 33:11.837
It's overweight. Cut a bit off.

33:17.253 --> 33:20.450
- Correct? Correct?
- Yes, sir.

33:26.763 --> 33:29.095
Come on, get those knees up.

33:29.899 --> 33:34.996
Up, come on! Left, left, left, right, left.

33:35.204 --> 33:38.264
Left, left, left, right, left. Come on!

34:05.501 --> 34:07.662
Staff, I'll see to them.

34:11.440 --> 34:13.168
Well, what about my grub?

34:13.976 --> 34:16.069
You missed it, didn't you?

34:37.333 --> 34:39.062
Like that hill, Roberts?

34:40.503 --> 34:42.697
Roberts, the court martial broke you,

34:42.772 --> 34:45.536
but I'm going to finish the job.
I'm gonna bust you wide open.

34:45.608 --> 34:47.132
I've got your number.

34:47.844 --> 34:49.402
You'd work as a dustman
if they gave you a uniform

34:49.478 --> 34:51.469
and a couple of men to yell at.

34:55.551 --> 34:58.111
- Do you think that's funny?
- Well, no.

34:58.187 --> 34:59.848
- I'll teach you.
- But everybody else...

34:59.922 --> 35:01.583
Get into your kit!

35:02.692 --> 35:06.423
Move it! I'll teach you.
And that goes for the rest of you.

35:08.965 --> 35:11.365
Move it! I said double outside.

35:13.202 --> 35:14.635
Mark time.

35:16.739 --> 35:17.865
Fall out!

35:17.940 --> 35:19.931
You dropped that little lad right in it,
didn't you, Roberts?

35:20.076 --> 35:22.670
Yeah, and we're going to be next
if he don't keep his big trap shut.

35:22.745 --> 35:24.076
Don't make things worse
than they are, Roberts.

35:24.146 --> 35:26.046
Look, he wants me.

35:27.450 --> 35:29.008
He wants you
'cause you're the wrong color.

35:29.085 --> 35:31.451
The rest of you
he doesn't find all that interesting yet.

35:31.520 --> 35:33.647
But he'll have you just the same.

35:33.723 --> 35:37.250
The RSM likes making toy soldiers.
Williams likes breaking them.

35:37.860 --> 35:40.488
Now, you all work out
what you're gonna do about it.

35:41.464 --> 35:44.558
Maybe you're right,
but keep your big mouth shut

35:44.634 --> 35:47.398
and don't give him
too many opportunities.

35:50.206 --> 35:52.834
How come you put one on your officer,
Roberts?

35:53.910 --> 35:57.141
- He asked for it.
- For ordering you up the line, you mean?

35:58.147 --> 36:01.548
- For ordering me up the line.
- Wasn't very considerate, was he?

36:01.851 --> 36:05.787
- Should have ordered you to a rest home.
- I'd have volunteered for that.

36:06.822 --> 36:09.450
You know, there's a yarn going round
that you beat up your officer

36:09.525 --> 36:11.891
and then ordered your lads out of line.

36:12.361 --> 36:14.591
- Is that the story?
- That's what I heard.

36:15.998 --> 36:19.161
- It's true I stuck it on him.
- Why, Roberts?

36:20.236 --> 36:23.603
Oh, you'll read all about it
when I write my memoirs.

36:24.874 --> 36:28.537
How Joe Roberts saw action one day
and didn't fancy a second basin?

36:28.978 --> 36:32.004
Well, I'll try and make it read
a bit better than that.

36:32.982 --> 36:34.415
How's this?

36:34.984 --> 36:40.081
Half the regiment wiped out, but not
gallant Sergeant Major Joe Roberts.

36:42.658 --> 36:46.321
I couldn't have that.
You see, I was due a week's leave in Cairo.

36:47.897 --> 36:51.458
The lads who'd gone in,
any of them still alive, Roberts?

36:58.174 --> 37:02.508
- Any of them still alive, Roberts?
- I am.

37:07.083 --> 37:09.381
Now that's all for now. Leave him.

37:09.719 --> 37:13.177
There'll be no more fighting.
Ain't we in trouble enough already?

37:15.558 --> 37:17.150
So chuck this in.

37:18.227 --> 37:22.664
All right.
I'll find a quiet corner to finish the job off.

37:24.934 --> 37:27.425
McGrath, you try that again
and I'll kill you.

37:29.739 --> 37:35.678
Williams is gunning for you.
Maybe I'll just leave it to him.

37:35.778 --> 37:37.769
You're a real thick-nut soldier.

37:38.614 --> 37:41.708
You'd shoot up kids in the next street
if you was ordered to.

37:41.784 --> 37:44.719
Look, I told you to chuck it in, man.
Chuck it in.

37:44.787 --> 37:45.776
Staff!

37:46.822 --> 37:47.811
Watch it.

37:55.464 --> 37:58.297
I hope you lot can put up
a better show than that.

38:07.309 --> 38:10.767
- Well, who knocked you about, Roberts?
- I bumped into the wall.

38:22.358 --> 38:23.723
Who was it?

38:25.728 --> 38:29.164
Like he said, Staff. Bumped into the wall.

38:33.335 --> 38:37.499
Well, if you keep bumping into walls,
Roberts, let me know who's pushing you.

38:42.845 --> 38:45.313
I won't stand for any punch-up artists,
McGrath.

38:45.381 --> 38:46.814
Aye, Staff.

38:47.450 --> 38:50.010
Right, into your kit, the lot of you.

38:50.086 --> 38:54.489
- Well, move it! Get Stevens up.
- Yes, Staff.

38:57.460 --> 39:00.395
- Oh, no. Please.
- He's in no fit state for a second helping.

39:00.463 --> 39:02.454
Fall in outside! At the double.

39:23.452 --> 39:24.714
Get in line!

39:33.062 --> 39:36.520
The Sergeant Major fancies he has
the patent on how to make soldiers.

39:36.599 --> 39:38.965
I'm gonna prove to him and to you lot
that I've got it, as well.

39:39.034 --> 39:42.595
Eyes front! Left turn! By the front.
Double march.

39:42.738 --> 39:46.538
Left, right, left, right, left, right,
left, right, left, right, left, right.

40:11.066 --> 40:16.129
Halt! Stand still! Right turn! Go!
Come on out of it, you four.

40:16.205 --> 40:21.233
Go on, move! Buckets of water.
Move! Come on! Move it out!

40:21.377 --> 40:25.939
Left, right, left, right, left, right.

40:32.555 --> 40:35.649
Detail, by the right, double march!

41:07.690 --> 41:10.352
Staff, man fainted!

41:18.133 --> 41:19.725
Right, up you go.

41:30.846 --> 41:33.974
Double. Roberts, move it!

41:36.085 --> 41:38.212
Staff, take over!

41:38.887 --> 41:40.650
Fill them up again.

41:47.162 --> 41:50.256
Come in. Hello, Charlie.

41:51.066 --> 41:52.465
Hello, Bert.

41:59.575 --> 42:01.873
- Sweetie?
- Thanks.

42:07.516 --> 42:09.006
Thought you ought to know, Bert,

42:09.084 --> 42:12.247
Williams has got all the mob
from Cell 8 on the hill.

42:12.454 --> 42:13.682
Has he?

42:14.189 --> 42:16.749
Including the lad he had on it a while ago.

42:17.293 --> 42:18.317
Well?

42:21.563 --> 42:23.861
I don't think the lad's up to it, Bert.

42:24.600 --> 42:28.934
I bet you were good to your mother and
I know you are too good to the prisoners.

42:29.004 --> 42:30.232
Getting idle your men are.

42:30.306 --> 42:33.207
Next thing you'll be having them
in the mess for a Saturday booze-up.

42:33.275 --> 42:36.438
- You think I'm losing my touch?
- Losing your touch, Bert.

42:36.512 --> 42:41.779
Twenty-five years service in, you'd think
you'd know your job. And you do.

42:42.051 --> 42:44.576
You think you can make soldiers
out of muck and you can.

42:44.653 --> 42:48.987
You've got an easy way with you, Charlie,
but don't come the old soldier with me.

42:49.258 --> 42:51.351
Stevens is A-1 fit for punishment.

42:52.428 --> 42:55.295
Bert, honest, he doesn't look
that way right now, look.

42:55.364 --> 42:58.731
It's here in black and white.
The M.O. Passed him fit. Now get out,

42:58.801 --> 43:01.599
or I'll have you doubling
with your little mates.

43:01.870 --> 43:04.361
Not over that hill.

43:06.408 --> 43:08.933
Even you wouldn't get me
over that hill, eh?

43:16.051 --> 43:17.746
Water, over here.

43:18.620 --> 43:23.887
Bartlett, on your feet, lad! Double.
You, douse him.

43:32.501 --> 43:35.527
Roberts, on your feet, lad, double!

43:35.738 --> 43:38.036
On your feet and double!

43:39.508 --> 43:40.600
Douse him.

43:45.614 --> 43:48.606
- Staff, he's crazy.
- I said douse him!

44:44.573 --> 44:46.837
All right, you bastards, fall in.

45:05.093 --> 45:06.390
Move it!

45:13.368 --> 45:14.767
Stand tall!

45:15.237 --> 45:18.263
Right turn! Forward turn!

45:19.208 --> 45:24.373
By the front! Double march!
Left, right, left, right, left wheel!

45:25.214 --> 45:27.978
Left, right, left, right, left, right,
left, right, left, right.

45:31.787 --> 45:34.255
Obeying orders, don't beat me.

45:37.726 --> 45:41.423
Mark time! Thank you, Staff.

45:43.899 --> 45:46.424
Forward march! Right wheel!

45:47.102 --> 45:49.627
Left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right.

45:54.776 --> 45:56.767
Left, right, left, right.

47:47.556 --> 47:49.217
Carry on, Staff.

48:45.614 --> 48:48.310
- Staff?
- Staff.

49:06.468 --> 49:08.834
Thought you might like a nightcap, sir.

49:25.087 --> 49:28.420
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

49:37.866 --> 49:42.929
Staff, Staff, Staff, it's me. It's Jacko, Staff.

49:44.206 --> 49:49.007
Staff, it's Jacko. Yeah, it's Jacko, Staff.

49:50.946 --> 49:56.384
I'm still up on my feet.
Staff, Staff, it's Jacko.

49:57.119 --> 50:01.852
The different-colored bastard. Staff.

50:03.925 --> 50:06.416
You wanna take me out again, Staff?

50:07.462 --> 50:09.453
You can't beat Jacko, Staff.

50:09.531 --> 50:14.628
No. Oh, no.
No, no man can beat Jacko, Staff.

50:16.238 --> 50:19.401
No man can beat Jacko, Staff.
No man can beat Jacko, Staff.

50:19.474 --> 50:22.841
- Darkie, go to your bed.
- Darkie?

50:23.445 --> 50:24.605
Okay, okay.

50:25.013 --> 50:28.540
- All right, I'm ready for another basin.
- Oh, get into your bed.

50:29.184 --> 50:32.745
Who are you shouting orders at?
I can do it again.

50:33.655 --> 50:36.749
Anytime. Williams won't beat me.

50:39.227 --> 50:41.525
You sand-happy bastards, it's night.

50:42.164 --> 50:44.655
That's not the sun. That's a Gestapo lamp.

50:53.475 --> 50:55.170
Get your kits off.

50:56.378 --> 50:58.403
Give him a hand.

51:02.818 --> 51:04.615
Come on, let's have it off.

51:07.556 --> 51:10.684
- Steady.
- Careful.

51:16.698 --> 51:20.532
- Straps are like bleeding knives.
- I'll get your shirt off.

51:23.839 --> 51:25.898
Stevens, here.

51:33.148 --> 51:34.172
Okay?

51:40.055 --> 51:41.613
There you go.

51:46.494 --> 51:50.225
Look at Monty.
Hey, you're a wise boy, aren't you?

51:50.665 --> 51:54.157
All these wogs are a load of cobblers.

51:54.636 --> 51:58.333
Monty, the screw'll put you over the hill
if he catches you smoking.

52:03.712 --> 52:06.078
And it's Commandant's inspection today.

52:08.817 --> 52:11.445
Three hours standing, too,
instead of doubling.

52:16.358 --> 52:19.953
Some rest. All day long in the blazing sun.

52:25.400 --> 52:30.770
I'll tell you one thing. They won't fault
my equipment. It's perfect.

52:35.877 --> 52:39.438
Yeah, but Stevens can't go on parade
with his kit like this.

52:39.514 --> 52:42.312
Well, he'll get the stick for it, then,
won't he?

53:13.481 --> 53:16.644
A Section, all present and correct, Staff!

53:16.718 --> 53:19.312
B Section, all present and correct, Staff!

53:20.055 --> 53:24.617
- C Section, all present and correct, Staff!
- D Section, all present and correct, Staff!

53:24.693 --> 53:30.097
- A Company, all present and correct, Staff!
- B Company, all present and correct, Staff!

53:30.465 --> 53:34.026
- A Wing, all present and correct, sir!
- Carry on, Staff.

53:38.740 --> 53:42.267
- B Wing, all present and correct, sir.
- Carry on, Staff.

53:45.647 --> 53:47.706
Stand still! Stand still!

54:16.211 --> 54:20.580
Staff, stand the prisoners at ease!

54:24.486 --> 54:29.355
A Wing, stand at ease!

54:30.392 --> 54:32.860
B Wing, stand at ease!

54:36.431 --> 54:40.697
Five minutes rest. Half an hour's attention.
Don't half crease you, doesn't it?

54:41.503 --> 54:44.267
We are all doing time, even the screws.

55:54.709 --> 55:57.337
All prisoners present and correct, sir.

56:04.085 --> 56:07.953
Front rank, one pace forward, march!

56:17.565 --> 56:23.299
Stevens. Your kit's a blinding wonder, lad.
You'll have RSM jealous.

56:55.904 --> 56:57.701
- White wash.
- White wash!

56:58.006 --> 57:01.032
White wash! One pace forward, march!

57:02.577 --> 57:07.105
Left turn!
What did you clean your kit with, lad?

57:08.383 --> 57:09.782
White wash, Staff.

57:09.951 --> 57:12.351
The Commandant knows you used
white wash. The RSM knows. I know.

57:12.420 --> 57:14.513
But you don't have to be a dozy
and own up to it.

57:14.589 --> 57:19.049
Double march! Take over, Staff!

57:20.695 --> 57:22.185
Left wheel!

57:23.665 --> 57:26.862
Left, left, left, right, left. Left.

57:28.636 --> 57:32.697
White wash, Roberts. You're too clever,
Roberts, that's your trouble.

57:33.975 --> 57:37.934
Stevens' kit was dirty, Mac.
He was bound to get some stick anyway.

57:38.813 --> 57:42.943
He's still too clever, Jacko.
Too damn clever by half.

57:45.853 --> 57:50.222
When it dries out,
look as good as new, lad. Better.

57:53.161 --> 57:56.562
Broken the King's heart if the RSM
phoned him and told him you'd been

57:56.631 --> 57:58.098
defacing his walls.

57:58.499 --> 57:59.864
Would it, Staff?

58:07.475 --> 58:12.936
Son, you shouldn't be in here, you know.
You shouldn't even be in the army.

58:14.482 --> 58:17.315
- We'd a queer in here a few weeks back
- I'm not queer!

58:17.385 --> 58:19.910
I know you're not.
Why don't you listen, eh?

58:22.890 --> 58:26.986
That nanny had a way with her.
She sang and she laughed all day.

58:29.897 --> 58:33.025
Put her over the hill
and she went into a dance routine.

58:33.167 --> 58:36.398
Better than those belly dancers
in the cabarets, isn't it?

58:39.173 --> 58:43.735
She wasn't any stronger than you,
but she knew how to survive,

58:45.146 --> 58:47.307
and that's what you've got to learn
in this army.

58:47.382 --> 58:49.373
You've got to learn how to, you know...

58:53.888 --> 58:55.355
How to survive, eh?

59:03.865 --> 59:06.299
Seem to have smartened up
the prisoners from Cell 8, Staff.

59:06.367 --> 59:07.834
Thank you, sir.

59:10.204 --> 59:12.001
And what about Stevens, eh?

59:12.240 --> 59:14.731
Yes, sir. I missed that, sir.
Didn't think Stevens would try it on, sir.

59:14.809 --> 59:16.572
He wouldn't. Somebody put him up to it.

59:16.644 --> 59:19.704
I'll take them all out, sir,
and we'll find the right man.

59:24.385 --> 59:25.579
Oh, Christ!

59:27.088 --> 59:30.751
You've knocked the rocks over,
haven't you, lad? Pick them up again.

59:39.834 --> 59:42.769
Very pretty, Roberts. Very pretty.

59:47.108 --> 59:48.439
Roberts.

59:53.581 --> 59:56.311
Cut it off! Cut it off!

01:00:00.855 --> 01:00:02.083
King, double.

01:00:04.158 --> 01:00:07.218
Right, King, you're on a charge.
I said double!

01:00:09.997 --> 01:00:12.158
All right, Bartlett, up you go, lad.

01:00:12.734 --> 01:00:13.723
Oh, yeah.

01:00:13.868 --> 01:00:16.928
- I don't think I'll be able to do this, Staff.
- Of course you will, lad. Come along.

01:00:17.004 --> 01:00:19.165
Well, you'll have to excuse me if I can't.

01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:21.538
- No. No. No.
- Get up it, Bartlett.

01:00:21.642 --> 01:00:24.236
Come on, Bartlett, let's have you get up it.

01:00:24.312 --> 01:00:26.507
You see, Staff,
I'm kinda not built for this sort of...

01:00:26.581 --> 01:00:28.446
- Get up it, Bartlett!
...thing, Staff.

01:00:29.851 --> 01:00:32.149
- Bartlett, get up it!
- I can't, Staff.

01:00:32.387 --> 01:00:35.413
- Get up it, Bartlett!
- I'm fat!

01:00:35.890 --> 01:00:37.448
I'm fat.

01:00:40.528 --> 01:00:42.723
- Get up it!
- You all know, don't you?

01:00:48.936 --> 01:00:51.598
Halt! Still! Left turn!

01:00:57.412 --> 01:01:00.540
Stevens, you're a dead bloody loss.

01:01:03.151 --> 01:01:04.675
Put it on.

01:01:14.962 --> 01:01:16.122
Hurry it up!

01:01:25.206 --> 01:01:26.730
Double march!

01:02:01.209 --> 01:02:03.040
I only wanted to go home.

01:02:07.081 --> 01:02:09.015
I can't stand any more.

01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:14.649
I can't take any more.

01:02:18.993 --> 01:02:21.621
- God help me.
- Will you shut up?

01:02:21.696 --> 01:02:22.685
Lay off.

01:02:22.864 --> 01:02:24.957
Well, if he goes on like that,
we'll have the padre in next,

01:02:25.032 --> 01:02:26.795
thinking he's got a new customer.

01:02:26.868 --> 01:02:28.768
He can't take that hill.

01:02:31.205 --> 01:02:32.399
- Stevens.
- No...

01:02:32.473 --> 01:02:36.170
- Stevens.
- I don't want to do any more.

01:02:36.344 --> 01:02:38.608
I just want... I just want to lay down.

01:02:42.450 --> 01:02:44.748
Listen, Roberts, if he goes...

01:02:44.819 --> 01:02:46.116
If he's sick, he goes on sick parade.

01:02:46.187 --> 01:02:47.620
Or you get a screw's permission
to bed him down.

01:02:47.688 --> 01:02:51.089
- Yeah, you're not dropping us in it again.
- That's right, Joe.

01:02:58.165 --> 01:03:01.032
Staff! Staff, we've got a sick man in here.

01:03:01.168 --> 01:03:04.137
All right! That's enough.

01:03:11.345 --> 01:03:13.643
Williams has had him on the hill,
now you get the vet.

01:03:13.714 --> 01:03:14.942
Staff.

01:03:16.584 --> 01:03:18.882
I want out from these lunatics, Staff.

01:03:20.187 --> 01:03:21.916
Bed the lad down, Roberts.

01:03:24.125 --> 01:03:26.093
You want something, Staff?

01:03:31.065 --> 01:03:33.659
Yes. I'd like a word with you.

01:03:34.402 --> 01:03:37.633
- This is my cell. I'm responsible here.
- I'm not, thank God.

01:03:37.705 --> 01:03:40.970
- Then leave it to me.
- You've got a sick man in here.

01:03:41.542 --> 01:03:44.705
- I can deal with it.
- I've given instructions to bed him down.

01:03:44.779 --> 01:03:46.076
If you don't get out sharp, Staff,

01:03:46.147 --> 01:03:49.878
I'll put you on report and let the RSM
decide what's right or not.

01:03:50.952 --> 01:03:53.944
So I can organize something,
a visit from the M.O.

01:03:54.021 --> 01:03:56.285
We'll see what he's got to say.

01:04:06.267 --> 01:04:08.633
McGrath, what's wrong with him?

01:04:09.637 --> 01:04:11.969
I'm not a vet, Staff.

01:04:15.309 --> 01:04:16.936
Right, get your towels.

01:04:17.845 --> 01:04:20.746
You've all had a busy time,
so I'm putting you under the showers

01:04:20.815 --> 01:04:23.249
to sweeten you up and smarten you up.

01:04:24.552 --> 01:04:25.712
We're taking Stevens with us.

01:04:25.786 --> 01:04:27.583
Yes, Staff.
Thank you very much indeed, Staff.

01:04:27.655 --> 01:04:29.247
Well get him on his feet.
Get him up, Bartlett!

01:04:29.323 --> 01:04:30.449
Yes, Staff.

01:04:31.692 --> 01:04:33.125
Come on, Staff wants you up.

01:04:33.194 --> 01:04:36.891
- No, no, please.
- Staff wants you upsy-daisy.

01:04:36.964 --> 01:04:39.091
- On your feet!
- He's in no fit state to walk.

01:04:39.166 --> 01:04:42.465
So he's in a terrible way, is he?
We'll soon see.

01:04:42.703 --> 01:04:44.432
Double over here, Stevens.

01:04:52.146 --> 01:04:55.547
Please, Joe, make him leave me alone.

01:04:56.584 --> 01:04:58.279
Please help me.

01:04:58.719 --> 01:05:03.747
- I can't take any more. I can't.
- It's all right.

01:05:10.434 --> 01:05:11.731
Okay, Stevens.

01:05:13.437 --> 01:05:14.699
Very touching.

01:05:16.307 --> 01:05:19.367
I'll get the preacher into you two
and get you married.

01:05:20.177 --> 01:05:22.611
Right, double outside. Outside!

01:05:23.948 --> 01:05:25.438
Drag that fairy out.

01:05:26.050 --> 01:05:30.146
If I'd known you were on your honeymoon,
I'd have had you in a separate cell.

01:05:30.788 --> 01:05:34.315
I don't hold with one of my staff
complaining about a brother officer.

01:05:34.391 --> 01:05:37.918
Listen, Bert, if Williams cripples Stevens,
you'll take the can back, not Williams.

01:05:37.995 --> 01:05:40.190
You telling me again
how to run this place?

01:05:40.264 --> 01:05:43.722
If I have any more complaints out of you,
I'll have you posted.

01:05:55.980 --> 01:05:57.641
Sir, I suggest you let the M.O. Decide

01:05:57.715 --> 01:05:59.706
whether or not
Stevens is fit for punishment.

01:05:59.783 --> 01:06:01.580
I make the decisions, me.

01:06:02.253 --> 01:06:05.450
I'll see if he's fit or not. Now, get out!

01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:21.201
Come on, Stevens, come on.
Come on, there.

01:06:21.372 --> 01:06:22.669
All right, McGrath.

01:06:23.007 --> 01:06:24.304
- Not that one.
- What?

01:06:24.375 --> 01:06:25.967
That turns on the gas.

01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:30.269
Quiet!

01:06:34.852 --> 01:06:36.752
What's this I hear about Stevens,
Mr. Wilson?

01:06:36.820 --> 01:06:38.651
Nothing to worry about, sir.

01:06:38.722 --> 01:06:42.317
- Well, Staff Harris told me...
- Harris? He's like a dream walking.

01:06:42.426 --> 01:06:44.485
If Stevens was sick he'd be here,
wouldn't he now?

01:06:44.562 --> 01:06:46.553
Oh, yes, I suppose so.

01:06:47.998 --> 01:06:50.626
Well, since I'm here, I'd better see him.

01:06:50.868 --> 01:06:53.234
I don't know my job, sir?
Think I don't know what's going on?

01:06:53.304 --> 01:06:54.362
I never said that.

01:06:54.438 --> 01:06:57.066
- I know what Staff Williams is doing.
- Staff Harris told me...

01:06:57.141 --> 01:06:58.335
Harris!

01:07:00.311 --> 01:07:01.676
He's sand-happy.

01:07:02.313 --> 01:07:04.838
I'm still in charge here, sir.

01:07:15.993 --> 01:07:17.585
I want to see Stevens.

01:07:17.962 --> 01:07:19.486
You've seen him, sir.

01:07:19.563 --> 01:07:20.894
What do you mean?

01:07:20.965 --> 01:07:23.798
You passed him fit,
fit for duty and punishment.

01:07:24.034 --> 01:07:27.595
The hill, Sergeant Major, if one
of the staff overdoes the good work...

01:07:27.671 --> 01:07:31.072
I could take it, sir.
Any fit man could take it, sir.

01:07:33.210 --> 01:07:38.273
Yes, well, as you say, if he were sick
he'd be here, wouldn't he? Yes.

01:07:40.918 --> 01:07:44.820
God, it's hot. It's like an oven in here.

01:07:49.893 --> 01:07:53.920
- Lights out five minutes!
- Still no sign of the M.O., eh?

01:07:54.031 --> 01:07:56.226
- Lights out five minutes!
- No.

01:07:58.502 --> 01:07:59.799
Lights out five minutes!

01:07:59.870 --> 01:08:02.464
- He looks better.
- Yeah.

01:08:02.539 --> 01:08:05.599
- Five minutes.
- Maybe Harris will get the vet tomorrow.

01:08:07.211 --> 01:08:08.542
It's a laugh.

01:08:08.812 --> 01:08:10.541
- Lights out five minutes.
- What is?

01:08:10.614 --> 01:08:13.947
All we ever get in this dump
is medicine and duties.

01:08:14.818 --> 01:08:16.911
One lunatic, you know, in Tunisia...

01:08:17.888 --> 01:08:21.517
That was a right nick, that was.
He made his blankets

01:08:21.658 --> 01:08:23.490
up into a kind of nest, you see,

01:08:23.560 --> 01:08:25.585
and he sat there all night
in the middle of them going,

01:08:25.662 --> 01:08:28.063
"Cuckoo, cuckoo," all night long.

01:08:28.131 --> 01:08:30.930
- He was trying to work his ticket.
- No. He was around the bend.

01:08:31.001 --> 01:08:33.094
He'd been frightened by a hand grenade,
I think.

01:08:33.170 --> 01:08:35.968
Anyway, the screw got the vet in, you see,

01:08:36.439 --> 01:08:38.670
and you know what
the vet recommended?

01:08:39.042 --> 01:08:41.341
- Medicine and duty.
- Medicine and duty.

01:08:41.679 --> 01:08:45.136
Anyway, the vet had a bright idea,
you see. He sort of fancied himself

01:08:45.215 --> 01:08:46.682
a bit of a trick cyclist,

01:08:46.750 --> 01:08:50.652
and he put this dummy hand grenade
into the nest with the cuckoo.

01:08:51.220 --> 01:08:54.917
- And you know what the cuckoo done?
- Aye, he tried to hatch it out.

01:08:57.328 --> 01:08:58.693
You've heard it.

01:08:59.897 --> 01:09:03.765
Anyway, you got to laugh, you know,
because some of these screws are comics.

01:09:03.834 --> 01:09:07.270
I mean, take Williams.
There's Stevens there on his chinstraps,

01:09:07.337 --> 01:09:11.798
all Williams can think of doing is giving
him the old, "Attention! About turn!

01:09:12.943 --> 01:09:14.308
"Double march!"

01:09:15.446 --> 01:09:18.073
- He's off.
- About turn!

01:09:18.148 --> 01:09:21.879
I wonder if he could hatch out
a packet of Player's for Monty Bartlett.

01:09:21.952 --> 01:09:26.082
Here, Stevens, that's it. You stick at it,
kiddo. You're a cert for your ticket you are.

01:09:26.156 --> 01:09:27.783
Left, right, left, right.

01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:33.093
Keep 'em up, boy. Keep 'em up.

01:09:33.162 --> 01:09:34.960
About turn more.

01:09:41.372 --> 01:09:45.103
About turn. About turn.

01:09:45.408 --> 01:09:47.502
Left turn, left turn, right turn.

01:09:48.645 --> 01:09:52.411
Double it up. That's it, boy. Double it up.

01:09:53.684 --> 01:09:55.151
Come on, boy.

01:10:20.277 --> 01:10:21.608
He's dead.

01:11:19.403 --> 01:11:22.634
The M.O.'ll have to write out
a death certificate, won't he?

01:11:22.940 --> 01:11:26.034
- What will he diagnose, carelessness?
- What's that?

01:11:26.343 --> 01:11:28.436
Careless of Stevens to drop dead.

01:11:28.946 --> 01:11:31.346
It's a bit late for your jokes, Charlie.

01:11:31.615 --> 01:11:34.049
- Word got around yet?
- It will, Bert.

01:11:34.451 --> 01:11:37.818
Might be some trouble.
We'd all better be on our toes.

01:11:39.156 --> 01:11:41.647
- I'd like to make a suggestion.
- Yes?

01:11:42.259 --> 01:11:43.886
Move Williams out of the block.

01:11:43.961 --> 01:11:46.122
Put him on the gate
where he can't do so much damage.

01:11:46.196 --> 01:11:49.393
But that would be as good as admitting
I think Williams killed the lad.

01:11:49.466 --> 01:11:53.095
Bert, I'd sooner have Williams
doubling in here than anybody.

01:11:53.303 --> 01:11:57.797
Listen, I ordered Williams
to smarten up the prisoners in Cell 8.

01:11:58.075 --> 01:12:00.236
- Yes, we all accept that...
- lf Stevens was fit,

01:12:00.310 --> 01:12:02.005
he'd still be here, wouldn't he?

01:12:02.079 --> 01:12:05.776
The army judged him A-1.
The M.O. Passed him fit for punishment.

01:12:08.085 --> 01:12:09.848
It looks like Stevens was only fit to drop.

01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:12.218
That's not your worry, it's the M.O.'s.

01:12:21.798 --> 01:12:23.163
Thank you, Bert.

01:12:24.067 --> 01:12:26.058
You said you backed your staff.

01:12:26.670 --> 01:12:29.867
We ain't celebrating
a glorious victory, Williams.

01:12:30.407 --> 01:12:32.932
We're patching up a bloody disaster.

01:12:41.618 --> 01:12:44.178
You realize I'll have to make a full report?

01:12:44.388 --> 01:12:45.912
We all will, sir.

01:12:45.989 --> 01:12:48.685
Well, he was perfectly fit
when I examined him.

01:12:48.892 --> 01:12:51.417
- When you did what, sir?
- Oh, when I made...

01:12:51.762 --> 01:12:53.753
When I examined him.

01:12:53.864 --> 01:12:55.331
You only looked at his watch and chain.

01:12:55.399 --> 01:12:56.388
Now look here, Sergeant Major...

01:12:56.466 --> 01:12:59.264
You passed him fit.
So I handed him over to Staff Williams.

01:12:59.336 --> 01:13:00.860
He was...

01:13:01.738 --> 01:13:04.468
Well, he was kept out in the sun too long.

01:13:04.942 --> 01:13:07.968
I've checked on his records.
Base job in an office.

01:13:08.045 --> 01:13:09.945
Well, anybody could see that.

01:13:10.814 --> 01:13:15.444
Suddenly, he's drilling for hour after hour
in the blazing sunshine.

01:13:16.086 --> 01:13:17.519
It was fatal in his case.

01:13:17.621 --> 01:13:20.112
- Sounds like accidental death, sir.
- Yes.

01:13:22.092 --> 01:13:25.823
The man was A-1,
but to come from a base job to this place...

01:13:25.896 --> 01:13:28.592
Well, you understand these things
better than me, sir. Accidental death.

01:13:28.665 --> 01:13:31.896
- That's what I thought, sir.
- Well, I hope so.

01:13:32.436 --> 01:13:35.701
I've dented a few, sir,
but I've never murdered any.

01:13:36.473 --> 01:13:40.534
- I wasn't referring to you.
- That goes for my staff, too, sir.

01:13:47.651 --> 01:13:48.913
Goodnight, sir.

01:14:01.632 --> 01:14:03.099
Accidental death.

01:14:05.602 --> 01:14:07.092
But if there's another accidental death,

01:14:07.170 --> 01:14:09.900
and you're in any way connected
with it, Staff...

01:14:33.063 --> 01:14:36.760
Waiting to find out
what Williams is gonna pull next

01:14:36.833 --> 01:14:39.961
is like waiting to go into action.
You know the feeling?

01:14:40.203 --> 01:14:43.263
I'm the fellow who refused to go in,
remember me?

01:14:49.112 --> 01:14:53.276
You beat up your officer
because he ordered the boys in?

01:14:54.084 --> 01:14:56.951
Yeah, that's right,
because he ordered the boys in.

01:15:00.557 --> 01:15:02.388
Was he going in hisself?

01:15:04.327 --> 01:15:06.693
No, I took them in.

01:15:07.864 --> 01:15:12.392
Right away we lost half our tanks.
So I pulled the boys out.

01:15:13.737 --> 01:15:16.900
I put the major in the picture.
I told him the situation was hopeless.

01:15:16.973 --> 01:15:20.136
If the mines didn't get us,
Jerry's anti-tank guns would.

01:15:25.882 --> 01:15:27.349
What'd the major say?

01:15:29.586 --> 01:15:34.649
"Get back in." He was very calm about it.
He said that he had his orders.

01:15:37.728 --> 01:15:40.788
The next thing I knew,
the boys were pulling me off him.

01:15:44.401 --> 01:15:49.703
Man, there's too many people in this army
giving the wrong orders.

01:15:51.341 --> 01:15:54.435
Somebody got to have the guts to cancel
some of them damn wrong orders.

01:15:54.511 --> 01:15:57.810
We'd have no bloody army left
if we didn't obey orders.

01:16:02.619 --> 01:16:03.677
Joe.

01:16:07.157 --> 01:16:09.887
You feel pretty bad about this, huh?

01:16:12.596 --> 01:16:15.759
Look, it's not just disobeying orders.

01:16:16.466 --> 01:16:20.266
It's rules, regulations, me.

01:16:27.844 --> 01:16:31.405
But, man, you saved all them boys
from getting killed for nothing.

01:16:31.481 --> 01:16:32.971
The troop sergeant took them in.

01:16:33.049 --> 01:16:36.018
I was put under close arrest.
None of them came back.

01:16:38.121 --> 01:16:42.217
Bloody cockroaches.
As if we haven't got enough to suffer

01:16:42.359 --> 01:16:45.954
without you two talking half the night.
Can't you let a man sleep?

01:16:46.363 --> 01:16:48.695
You ain't been sleeping
much yourself, Joe.

01:16:48.765 --> 01:16:51.529
- No.
- Another stinking hot day.

01:16:53.737 --> 01:16:58.333
- You can practically hear it boiling already.
- Look at Monty, flat out!

01:16:59.676 --> 01:17:01.837
Wake up!

01:17:08.385 --> 01:17:10.717
- Who done that?
- I did.

01:17:11.855 --> 01:17:15.222
You want to watch it, mate.
You just want to watch it.

01:17:20.297 --> 01:17:23.596
Somebody ought to write to their MP
about this dump.

01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:27.395
- Yeah? Why don't you?
- What, him? I bet he can't even write.

01:17:28.972 --> 01:17:31.770
What's so clever
about being able to write, then?

01:17:33.610 --> 01:17:39.981
The secret in this old world, mate,
is to use your loaf. Maybe I can't read.

01:17:40.650 --> 01:17:44.142
When it comes to knocking off stuff,
I'm away out in front on me own.

01:17:44.221 --> 01:17:45.654
I'll bet you are.

01:17:46.556 --> 01:17:48.581
You're a fair sample of the no-talent class.

01:17:48.658 --> 01:17:51.525
Thieving three bottles of whisky, blimey.

01:17:52.195 --> 01:17:55.323
I didn't thieve them, man, I drank them.

01:17:56.633 --> 01:17:58.430
Bet he can't write, neither.

01:17:58.501 --> 01:18:01.163
Monty, just because I'm black,

01:18:01.371 --> 01:18:03.703
do I have to be damn ignorant, too?

01:18:04.207 --> 01:18:06.767
You blacks ain't got the brains
of us whites.

01:18:08.345 --> 01:18:11.178
- Listen to that man.
- You've got it downstairs, mate,

01:18:11.248 --> 01:18:12.943
but we've got it upstairs.

01:18:14.584 --> 01:18:16.882
Live up trees, you blokes do.

01:18:18.889 --> 01:18:21.449
I seen a film about his tribe once.

01:18:22.759 --> 01:18:25.353
It's called <i>Tarzan and the Ape Men.</i>

01:18:27.964 --> 01:18:30.091
When Charlie Bloggs found you lot,

01:18:30.467 --> 01:18:33.994
you was walking around starkers,
living on monkey nuts.

01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:41.170
So this is a member of the great white
race, and there's plenty like Monty.

01:18:42.078 --> 01:18:44.069
We just call them white trash.

01:18:44.514 --> 01:18:47.574
Now, look, I don't go for that expression,
white trash.

01:18:47.651 --> 01:18:48.948
What's Staff Williams?

01:18:49.019 --> 01:18:51.681
Belt up!
We don't want to hear about Williams.

01:18:52.289 --> 01:18:53.722
That I can believe.

01:18:56.159 --> 01:18:58.320
I'm making a report about Williams.

01:19:04.734 --> 01:19:07.760
Now, listen, Roberts,
we're all aware of what happened,

01:19:08.872 --> 01:19:10.100
but there's nothing we can do about it.

01:19:10.173 --> 01:19:11.435
- Yeah.
- So.

01:19:11.508 --> 01:19:14.375
- It's a pity about old Stevens...
- We're all in sympathy?

01:19:14.444 --> 01:19:15.934
You had a rough deal.

01:19:16.279 --> 01:19:19.339
So I can count on you
when we go to see the Commandant?

01:19:19.549 --> 01:19:22.245
- To enquire after his health, or what?
- But of course.

01:19:22.319 --> 01:19:24.150
Then we'll slap a murder charge
against Williams.

01:19:24.220 --> 01:19:28.486
Wakey wakey! Rise and shine!
Let's have you.

01:19:28.758 --> 01:19:31.158
Who killed Stevens?

01:19:35.065 --> 01:19:36.589
Do you hear that?

01:19:36.800 --> 01:19:38.631
Now, are you going to sit
on your jacksies and do nothing?

01:20:04.928 --> 01:20:06.452
Take over, Staff!

01:20:06.596 --> 01:20:09.997
- Staff! What the hell's going on here?
- Sir, the prisoners.

01:20:10.166 --> 01:20:13.897
Sounds like victory celebrations. Get every
available staff here at the double.

01:20:13.970 --> 01:20:15.198
Armed, sir?

01:20:15.372 --> 01:20:18.102
Where the hell do you think you are,
Chicago?

01:20:27.117 --> 01:20:30.245
Staffs! Let them out!

01:20:33.723 --> 01:20:36.123
I said let them out!

01:21:48.498 --> 01:21:51.160
- Stevens, Stevens.
- Stevens, Stevens.

01:23:11.948 --> 01:23:14.610
What's your name? Oliver Twist?

01:23:16.252 --> 01:23:19.380
Put that mess tin down.
It's too early for breakfast.

01:23:24.427 --> 01:23:26.395
What's your name?

01:23:27.931 --> 01:23:30.627
- Stevens!
- Staff Burton!

01:23:32.735 --> 01:23:35.169
We've had a miracle.
Here's a man returned from the dead.

01:23:35.238 --> 01:23:37.172
Take him back to the mortuary.

01:23:37.407 --> 01:23:39.841
- Mortuary, sir?
- In the mortuary, via the hill.

01:23:39.909 --> 01:23:42.434
Give him a last good run
before we bury him.

01:23:44.647 --> 01:23:46.012
Double him away!

01:23:55.191 --> 01:23:56.522
Left, right, left, right, left...

01:23:56.593 --> 01:23:58.185
- Staff!
- Sir.

01:23:58.261 --> 01:24:00.695
Double away
and get me a copy of the KRs.

01:24:00.964 --> 01:24:01.953
Sir.

01:24:16.246 --> 01:24:17.406
- Johnson!
- Sir.

01:24:17.480 --> 01:24:21.439
- Did you start the mutiny?
- I didn't start anything.

01:24:21.618 --> 01:24:24.917
Then what was all the noise in aid of?
Exercising your lungs?

01:24:24.988 --> 01:24:26.649
Who killed Stevens?

01:24:27.357 --> 01:24:28.585
- Staff.
- Sir!

01:24:28.758 --> 01:24:30.988
Double this man out to the mortuary.

01:24:31.427 --> 01:24:34.396
Show him the body. If he finds any marks,

01:24:34.497 --> 01:24:36.965
abrasions or bullet wounds on the body,

01:24:37.233 --> 01:24:38.962
take him over to the Commandant's office

01:24:39.035 --> 01:24:41.697
and stay with him
while he writes out his statement.

01:24:41.771 --> 01:24:46.003
Then let him see the Commandant
on his own so he can speak freely.

01:24:46.376 --> 01:24:48.037
- Yes, sir.
- Double out.

01:24:48.111 --> 01:24:52.241
Double out!
Left, right, left, right, left, right, left.

01:24:56.219 --> 01:24:57.652
Left wheel.

01:25:04.594 --> 01:25:08.621
Now, you've all been making
a hell of a racket.

01:25:09.232 --> 01:25:13.191
There'll be no more of it,
or I'll have the lot of you over the hill.

01:25:13.336 --> 01:25:15.201
Every damn one of you.

01:25:16.606 --> 01:25:21.043
Now, if you've any complaints,
you're free to see the Commandant.

01:25:24.947 --> 01:25:30.351
Any more trouble
and I'll read you the Riot Act.

01:25:30.653 --> 01:25:32.450
You know how long it takes.

01:25:32.889 --> 01:25:35.119
And if that doesn't have any effect,

01:25:35.925 --> 01:25:39.088
I'll charge the ring leaders with mutiny.

01:25:39.228 --> 01:25:43.324
- Who's the ring leaders?
- Every fifth man!

01:25:51.474 --> 01:25:55.535
Think that over.
I don't waste my breath on idle threats.

01:25:56.746 --> 01:25:59.613
Now, let's have you looking like soldiers.

01:26:00.149 --> 01:26:02.709
Prisoners, attention!

01:26:02.852 --> 01:26:05.616
Stand at ease! Let's have that again.

01:26:08.591 --> 01:26:11.651
Attention! Better.

01:26:15.665 --> 01:26:18.099
Now, any man here got any complaints?

01:26:19.969 --> 01:26:22.199
Anybody want to see the Commandant?

01:26:23.906 --> 01:26:27.205
Anybody witnessed any murders recently?

01:26:29.846 --> 01:26:31.973
Scared to open your traps or what?

01:26:33.149 --> 01:26:37.779
Anybody wishing to see the Commandant,
step forward.

01:26:47.130 --> 01:26:48.927
Why do you want to see him?

01:26:50.533 --> 01:26:55.732
I wish to report, sir, Staff Williams
responsible for Stevens' death.

01:26:56.672 --> 01:26:58.003
Witnesses?

01:26:59.575 --> 01:27:02.237
All the men in my cell
know what happened, sir.

01:27:04.247 --> 01:27:07.080
Bartlett, double over here.

01:27:11.154 --> 01:27:14.954
You saw Staff Williams murder
Private Stevens. Is that right?

01:27:15.558 --> 01:27:16.820
No, sir.
I never saw nothing of the kind, sir.

01:27:16.893 --> 01:27:17.951
Don't lie to me, lad.

01:27:18.027 --> 01:27:20.291
You saw him with blood-stained hands,
didn't you now?

01:27:20.363 --> 01:27:21.762
No, sir. Never saw nothing, sir.

01:27:21.831 --> 01:27:23.321
Request to be moved to another cell.

01:27:23.399 --> 01:27:25.594
Request refused. Get back in the line.

01:27:27.370 --> 01:27:29.531
McGrath, double over here.

01:27:35.011 --> 01:27:37.775
Is it right you saw murder committed,
McGrath?

01:27:39.048 --> 01:27:43.382
No, sir, but I'll be committing one
if Roberts doesn't stop squawking.

01:27:43.719 --> 01:27:44.879
Double back.

01:27:47.690 --> 01:27:49.749
King, double over here.

01:27:56.165 --> 01:27:58.531
Now let's hear from you, King.

01:28:01.871 --> 01:28:04.669
Staff Williams murdered Stevens all right.

01:28:05.942 --> 01:28:08.410
My only worry's how we're gonna prove it.

01:28:09.512 --> 01:28:10.911
Double away, King.

01:28:18.221 --> 01:28:20.155
- Staff Williams!
- Yes, sir.

01:28:20.256 --> 01:28:22.121
- Did you hear that?
- Yes, sir.

01:28:22.225 --> 01:28:24.455
Serious allegation that is.

01:28:24.527 --> 01:28:27.360
He's lying, sir.
I never laid a finger on Stevens.

01:28:27.730 --> 01:28:29.220
- Staff Harris!
- Sir.

01:28:29.398 --> 01:28:32.526
I want Roberts and King on
Commandant's parade, 0930 hours.

01:28:32.602 --> 01:28:34.866
- Yes, sir.
- And notify the medical officer

01:28:34.937 --> 01:28:37.770
he's wanted at the Commandant's Office
0930 hours.

01:28:38.040 --> 01:28:40.634
Seems Stevens didn't die of sunstroke.

01:28:41.978 --> 01:28:45.209
He was murdered in cold blood.

01:28:45.781 --> 01:28:49.080
- Is that right, sir?
- Tell him be sure to be there.

01:28:49.485 --> 01:28:51.851
His professional reputation's at stake.

01:28:52.788 --> 01:28:55.518
Our M.O., sir? I won't wear that.

01:28:55.758 --> 01:28:58.955
It's well known he can make
the lame walk, the blind see

01:28:59.028 --> 01:29:01.326
and the maimed dance over the hill.

01:29:06.335 --> 01:29:08.530
What else can he do, Staff?

01:29:09.005 --> 01:29:12.998
Ride a bicycle on the sea, no hands,
and turn water into wine, sir.

01:29:14.076 --> 01:29:17.068
But can he raise the dead, Staff?

01:29:17.547 --> 01:29:20.448
No, sir. He can't raise them,
but he can lower them.

01:29:22.451 --> 01:29:25.579
Yes, I got your vocation placed now!

01:29:26.989 --> 01:29:29.457
You should have been a music hall comic!

01:29:30.359 --> 01:29:31.451
Yes, sir.

01:29:31.527 --> 01:29:34.792
Permission to organize a smoking concert
for the prisoners?

01:29:36.399 --> 01:29:39.926
You've organized too bloody many
all ready, Charlie!

01:29:41.170 --> 01:29:42.831
Think I don't know?

01:29:43.339 --> 01:29:44.738
Got a light, sir?

01:29:45.207 --> 01:29:50.577
No, but I've got a pack to put on your back
if I catch you smoking.

01:30:04.727 --> 01:30:08.458
Bartlett and McGrath, stand by for a call.
You may be needed.

01:30:11.734 --> 01:30:16.694
Now, you'll all be having cheese
with your lunch today.

01:30:20.576 --> 01:30:24.910
Now, get back into your cells,
and look sharp about it.

01:30:25.314 --> 01:30:28.681
You've all had a lovely time.
Staffs, take over.

01:30:58.280 --> 01:31:02.410
- Trying to get at me, eh, Charlie?
- Who me?

01:31:02.952 --> 01:31:06.149
As from now,
you'll take your orders from Williams.

01:31:07.056 --> 01:31:08.717
So that's the way it is.

01:31:09.458 --> 01:31:11.153
I know you won't mind.

01:31:11.527 --> 01:31:15.224
You're always bragging you don't seek
promotion or favors.

01:31:15.464 --> 01:31:18.092
I'd sooner be out of it, sir, well out of it.

01:31:20.670 --> 01:31:23.104
You're getting passed over, Staff.

01:31:33.015 --> 01:31:34.414
Inside, King.

01:31:41.724 --> 01:31:45.251
- Think you can get away with this?
- I should be asking you that.

01:31:46.929 --> 01:31:48.556
Thank you, Staff.

01:31:53.102 --> 01:31:55.229
You know what the outcome will be?

01:31:55.905 --> 01:31:58.931
There'll be a Court of Enquiry,
and I'll be exonerated.

01:31:59.208 --> 01:32:01.836
No, you're getting nervous, Williams.

01:32:03.412 --> 01:32:07.280
You want me, don't you?
You fancy your chances?

01:32:07.583 --> 01:32:09.710
You make a move and I'll drop you.

01:32:10.352 --> 01:32:13.321
Not a bad idea. Just us two.

01:32:14.223 --> 01:32:16.157
There's a solitary at the end.

01:32:16.659 --> 01:32:20.459
Nobody can see into that.
I'll lock us inside, Roberts. Just us two.

01:32:20.529 --> 01:32:23.623
- You're on.
- March over.

01:32:57.633 --> 01:32:58.827
Me first.

01:33:00.302 --> 01:33:01.326
Inside.

01:33:05.908 --> 01:33:06.897
Hang up.

01:33:08.277 --> 01:33:10.745
Go back to your duties, come on.
Double away!

01:33:21.056 --> 01:33:22.683
I want no more trouble.

01:33:23.726 --> 01:33:25.193
No more out of you.

01:33:26.095 --> 01:33:27.790
You'll learn discipline.

01:33:29.365 --> 01:33:30.992
Learn we mean business.

01:33:32.067 --> 01:33:33.557
You'd better do some
quick thinking, Roberts...

01:33:33.636 --> 01:33:34.625
Staff.

01:33:35.805 --> 01:33:37.796
I want to transfer out of here.

01:33:37.907 --> 01:33:40.467
You're going out, Bartlett, you little runt.

01:33:40.709 --> 01:33:43.803
Out over the hill.
Now, get your packs on, all of you.

01:33:45.281 --> 01:33:48.011
Come on, and get Roberts up.
He's coming with us.

01:33:48.717 --> 01:33:50.241
I'll be back for you.

01:33:51.654 --> 01:33:53.349
You've got five minutes!

01:34:03.933 --> 01:34:07.596
Joe's on Commandant's Orders.
How's Williams going to explain this?

01:34:07.903 --> 01:34:09.530
You think the Commandant's
never set eyes on a prisoner

01:34:09.605 --> 01:34:11.436
who's been done over before?

01:34:12.341 --> 01:34:14.605
I've got something to say about this,

01:34:15.177 --> 01:34:20.308
- and I'll make damn sure he listens.
- If not, I'm getting word outside.

01:34:20.516 --> 01:34:23.007
You two are enough
to drive a fellow up the wall.

01:34:23.085 --> 01:34:27.488
Somebody's gonna find out
what's going on in here, what's happening.

01:34:28.290 --> 01:34:31.020
We're inside, Sergeant Major, inside,

01:34:32.394 --> 01:34:35.192
and the bloody world outside
doesn't give a damn.

01:34:38.067 --> 01:34:41.969
We're the horrible 2%,
the dodgy boys, the spivs,

01:34:42.471 --> 01:34:47.238
the cowards, the thieves.
We're the weak chain in the system.

01:34:49.478 --> 01:34:51.070
Oh, to hell with you.

01:34:55.818 --> 01:34:57.786
Into your kit, Roberts.

01:34:59.154 --> 01:35:00.143
No.

01:35:01.257 --> 01:35:02.849
Not for you, Williams.

01:35:03.325 --> 01:35:07.261
Right. Two volunteers to drag Roberts
over the hill. You, Bartlett, you, McGrath.

01:35:07.329 --> 01:35:08.455
Yes, Staff.

01:35:14.637 --> 01:35:15.831
McGrath?

01:35:19.808 --> 01:35:21.105
To hell with this.

01:35:21.176 --> 01:35:23.406
I'm giving you an order, McGrath.

01:35:24.280 --> 01:35:27.613
Listen, Williams,
the army didn't buy me in a slave market.

01:35:28.918 --> 01:35:33.412
I'll double over the hill for you,
but I'll not drag another man with me.

01:35:35.391 --> 01:35:39.885
All right, I'll get all the volunteers I want,
and I'll have the lot of you out.

01:35:41.196 --> 01:35:44.029
He's barmy. I've got to get out of this lot.

01:35:45.668 --> 01:35:47.158
Shut up!

01:35:49.004 --> 01:35:51.302
Well, what's the matter with you then?

01:35:56.845 --> 01:35:58.779
Joe, tell them, go on.

01:36:00.015 --> 01:36:02.916
I'll obey any order.
I'm not looking for no trouble.

01:36:03.686 --> 01:36:04.744
Git!

01:36:16.098 --> 01:36:17.258
Staff!

01:36:18.033 --> 01:36:21.560
- Staff, I've got to get out of here.
- All right, cut it out!

01:36:24.239 --> 01:36:27.868
- Staff, they're crucifying me.
- Move him, Staff.

01:36:34.516 --> 01:36:35.778
Get your small kit and report to the M.O.

01:36:35.851 --> 01:36:39.343
No, I'm on Commandant's orders.
I'm not missing that.

01:36:40.255 --> 01:36:41.620
Let me see this.

01:36:44.526 --> 01:36:46.118
King, McGrath, carry him over to the M.O.

01:36:46.195 --> 01:36:50.131
I'll see you see the Commandant,
don't worry. Come on, sharp, come here.

01:36:54.303 --> 01:36:55.793
Easy with him, now. Easy.

01:36:58.140 --> 01:37:01.007
All right,
watch that going through the door.

01:37:02.911 --> 01:37:04.708
Hold your head low.

01:37:05.514 --> 01:37:08.449
Put me in another cell, Staff.
I've had a bellyful of this lot.

01:37:08.517 --> 01:37:09.814
Buckle it up.

01:37:14.156 --> 01:37:17.592
Well, I'm only looking after
number one, ain't I?

01:37:20.863 --> 01:37:25.266
What's the matter with everybody
in this bloody place?

01:37:27.436 --> 01:37:29.131
They're not here, Staff.

01:37:29.304 --> 01:37:30.965
They've gone.

01:37:31.707 --> 01:37:34.198
Staff Harris has taken them over
to the M.O.

01:37:34.376 --> 01:37:36.207
Back to your detail. About turn!

01:37:36.278 --> 01:37:39.873
Double march!
Left, right, left, right, left, right.

01:38:02.504 --> 01:38:03.903
Get him over here.

01:38:12.481 --> 01:38:17.180
- What's this, Staff?
- Roberts is reporting sick.

01:38:18.520 --> 01:38:20.215
Double outside, you two.

01:38:22.591 --> 01:38:23.990
Okay, double out.

01:38:30.399 --> 01:38:32.367
On your feet, Roberts.

01:38:33.602 --> 01:38:35.502
Jerk him out of it, Staff.

01:38:35.904 --> 01:38:37.735
He's got a busted foot.

01:38:38.006 --> 01:38:39.837
What the hell are you two
doing outside here?

01:38:39.908 --> 01:38:42.035
Brought Roberts over, sir. He's poorly.

01:38:47.516 --> 01:38:48.744
On your feet.

01:38:49.218 --> 01:38:51.049
He's got a foot injury, sir.

01:38:52.221 --> 01:38:56.089
On your feet, Roberts,
and stand to attention.

01:39:08.737 --> 01:39:10.170
March outside.

01:39:15.911 --> 01:39:19.039
Left, right, left, right.

01:39:21.116 --> 01:39:22.378
Keep marching.

01:39:22.951 --> 01:39:24.748
- Double inside, you two.
- Right, double in.

01:39:24.820 --> 01:39:30.520
Left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right,

01:39:30.592 --> 01:39:33.254
left, right, left, right,

01:39:33.328 --> 01:39:37.458
left, right, left, right. Halt!

01:39:39.768 --> 01:39:40.894
About turn.

01:39:42.070 --> 01:39:44.402
Para 528, Section 7.

01:39:44.573 --> 01:39:47.872
"An officer will not reprove a warrant
officer or an NCO in the presence

01:39:47.943 --> 01:39:49.672
"or hearing of a private soldier."

01:39:49.745 --> 01:39:52.270
- You know the KRRs, don't you?
- Yes, sir.

01:39:52.381 --> 01:39:54.110
You're breaking every rule in the book.

01:39:54.183 --> 01:39:56.947
- And you live by it, don't you?
- We're both regulars.

01:39:57.019 --> 01:39:58.816
We are the army.
What the hell else are we supposed to do?

01:39:58.887 --> 01:40:00.616
Well, I lived by the book.

01:40:00.923 --> 01:40:03.653
Para this,
and Para under Section X-Y-Z that.

01:40:04.193 --> 01:40:06.753
But Queen Victoria's dead. It's out of date.

01:40:07.229 --> 01:40:08.355
What kind of a soldier are you?

01:40:08.430 --> 01:40:10.830
I'm a live one, unless Williams has got
other plans for me.

01:40:10.899 --> 01:40:13.959
Discipline. The army's run on discipline.

01:40:14.469 --> 01:40:18.064
I'm a regular soldier because
I couldn't get a bloody job in civvy street,

01:40:18.140 --> 01:40:21.303
but I was a good toy clockwork soldier,
just like you are.

01:40:21.476 --> 01:40:24.934
You throw an order at me and I could
pick it up like a dog picks up a bone.

01:40:25.013 --> 01:40:27.914
- On your feet and you listen.
- No, you listen!

01:40:28.283 --> 01:40:29.580
Three bloody years in the desert.

01:40:29.651 --> 01:40:31.949
Three bloody years fighting
under paid gunmen. That's all we are.

01:40:32.020 --> 01:40:34.386
- Treason, you're talking treason.
- Right!

01:40:34.456 --> 01:40:35.821
Get on your feet.

01:40:37.659 --> 01:40:42.687
Okay, treason. That's Para 531, Section 7.

01:40:42.898 --> 01:40:46.197
"Any person committing any traitorous

01:40:46.568 --> 01:40:50.060
"or mutinous practice may be

01:40:50.172 --> 01:40:53.039
"sentenced to penal servitude
for the term of his natural life."

01:40:53.108 --> 01:40:54.700
- So you...
- Life.

01:40:55.010 --> 01:40:56.170
Well, all right.

01:40:56.245 --> 01:40:59.078
All I know is that I can't do things
that don't make sense to me anymore.

01:40:59.147 --> 01:41:01.479
You can. You can still live by the book,

01:41:01.550 --> 01:41:03.780
but it's out of date!
It's stupid and out of date!

01:41:03.852 --> 01:41:05.342
So, you quit, eh?

01:41:05.687 --> 01:41:07.552
Glasshouse permanent
for the rest of the war?

01:41:07.623 --> 01:41:11.184
- Right!
- You'd sign away our bloody empire.

01:41:11.260 --> 01:41:13.251
Yes, give it to Jacko, maybe he can use it.

01:41:13.328 --> 01:41:16.024
To the niggers!
They couldn't run a knocking shop.

01:41:16.098 --> 01:41:18.623
On your feet, stand up and stand still!

01:41:18.700 --> 01:41:22.796
Yes, I'm on my feet.
Well, what's the charge?

01:41:23.205 --> 01:41:24.934
Failing to obey an order?

01:41:25.874 --> 01:41:28.741
Drunk in charge of a cigarette lighter?

01:41:29.411 --> 01:41:31.072
You crazy bastard.

01:41:31.880 --> 01:41:34.849
You'd prop up dead men and inspect them
if you was ordered to.

01:41:34.916 --> 01:41:36.941
Right, you're right.

01:41:40.188 --> 01:41:41.985
Keep those men on the move!

01:41:45.427 --> 01:41:48.362
You used to be an NCO.
You used to be a soldier,

01:41:48.530 --> 01:41:51.192
but you've forgotten.
Now, I'm gonna teach you.

01:41:51.333 --> 01:41:52.732
Teach you from the beginning.

01:41:52.801 --> 01:41:55.929
I'll make you into something
the army can be proud of.

01:41:56.405 --> 01:41:59.272
You'll double, drill,
do any damn thing I tell you.

01:42:00.142 --> 01:42:02.736
Roberts, you'll be lost, lost,

01:42:03.545 --> 01:42:07.345
unless somebody's shouting
an order at you. Staff!

01:42:07.416 --> 01:42:08.405
Sir!

01:42:14.890 --> 01:42:16.414
How did Roberts get into this state?

01:42:16.491 --> 01:42:18.425
Been fighting with one of the prisoners,
sir. McGrath.

01:42:18.493 --> 01:42:20.085
- Has he?
- He got stuck into me, as well.

01:42:20.162 --> 01:42:21.288
- Did he?
- I took him out of the cell.

01:42:21.363 --> 01:42:23.263
Gave him the order to double,
he refused and struck me.

01:42:23.332 --> 01:42:24.560
We had to restrain him, sir.

01:42:24.633 --> 01:42:26.464
- Any witnesses, Staff?
- Henshaw and Colbey, sir.

01:42:26.535 --> 01:42:28.400
I hope he didn't beat you up too bad, Staff.

01:42:28.470 --> 01:42:29.494
If Henshaw and Colbey
hadn't come along, sir...

01:42:29.571 --> 01:42:32.768
It's clear Roberts is a dangerous fellow,
but if you ever have to restrain him again,

01:42:32.841 --> 01:42:35.036
I don't want him looking
like a battle casualty, understand?

01:42:35.110 --> 01:42:36.737
He come at me
and went smack into the wall, sir.

01:42:36.812 --> 01:42:39.178
He must have.
There's no other logical explanation.

01:42:39.247 --> 01:42:40.578
McGrath did most of the damage.

01:42:40.649 --> 01:42:43.049
Yes. Charge him with fighting McGrath,

01:42:43.652 --> 01:42:45.950
Colbey and Henshaw
and with insubordination.

01:42:46.021 --> 01:42:48.922
McGrath didn't beat me up, Williams did.

01:42:48.990 --> 01:42:50.048
Witnesses?

01:42:51.326 --> 01:42:54.159
Staff! From now on,
I'm looking after his welfare.

01:42:54.796 --> 01:42:56.388
Sir, I can manage him.

01:42:58.033 --> 01:43:01.230
No, you can't, Staff.
You're a bloody revelation.

01:43:01.303 --> 01:43:04.431
But let me tell you,
this is your last chance.

01:43:04.606 --> 01:43:07.803
Beat up another one of my lads,
and I'll have you inside here,

01:43:07.876 --> 01:43:10.709
and if the prisoners don't cripple you,
I will.

01:43:10.779 --> 01:43:13.247
- Now, get the others over here.
- Yes, sir.

01:43:14.015 --> 01:43:15.505
Double over, you two!

01:43:16.017 --> 01:43:19.680
Come on, move it!
Left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right.

01:43:20.021 --> 01:43:22.353
Halt! Stand still.

01:43:24.192 --> 01:43:27.923
McGrath. You had a fight with Roberts,
is that right?

01:43:28.764 --> 01:43:30.391
We had a slight difference.

01:43:30.465 --> 01:43:33.400
- And you witnessed it.
- They had a scrap.

01:43:34.102 --> 01:43:35.501
You made a right job of him, didn't you?

01:43:35.570 --> 01:43:39.006
- I'm not responsible for the state he's in.
- Then who is?

01:43:40.308 --> 01:43:41.798
Staff Williams, sir.

01:43:42.511 --> 01:43:45.639
He took Joe out, and when Joe come back,
he was like that.

01:43:46.515 --> 01:43:48.506
I'll say I know damn well
McGrath had nothing to do with it.

01:43:48.583 --> 01:43:51.074
Stand to attention
when I'm talking to you.

01:43:51.987 --> 01:43:55.081
Now, nigger boy, tell me again,
what did you see?

01:43:56.158 --> 01:43:58.251
You black ape, I'm talking to you.

01:43:58.493 --> 01:44:00.358
Do you want to do a dose of solitary?

01:44:00.429 --> 01:44:04.263
You stinking filthy nigger, answer me.
What did you see?

01:44:05.734 --> 01:44:09.864
I'll see you in hell, you...

01:44:11.940 --> 01:44:15.740
You ruddy useless Sergeant Major. In hell!

01:44:15.911 --> 01:44:19.210
Look at that.
Dancing about like a flea-bitten monkey.

01:44:19.881 --> 01:44:21.212
Thinks he's still in the jungle.

01:44:21.283 --> 01:44:23.615
I'll teach you you're in the British Army.

01:44:23.685 --> 01:44:29.646
I quit your stinking army, you hear that?
You loud-mouthed Sergeant Major.

01:44:29.958 --> 01:44:32.893
I give up this damn soldiering.
Now what you gonna do about it?

01:44:32.961 --> 01:44:34.758
Throw every charge in the book at him,
Staff.

01:44:34.830 --> 01:44:35.956
Sir.

01:44:36.031 --> 01:44:37.862
But first of all, see that Harris has him

01:44:37.933 --> 01:44:39.833
outside the Commandant's office
at 0930 hours.

01:44:39.901 --> 01:44:41.232
The Commandant can hear his case.

01:44:41.303 --> 01:44:43.533
- Yes, sir. You'll be there, sir?
- No, Staff.

01:44:43.605 --> 01:44:47.132
I shall be busy making arrangements
for Stevens' funeral.

01:44:47.742 --> 01:44:50.802
You're gonna let them shoot
their mouths off and not be there, sir?

01:44:50.879 --> 01:44:54.781
You worried, Staff? Any cause to be?

01:44:55.217 --> 01:44:56.309
I haven't.

01:44:56.918 --> 01:44:59.614
Let them shout, then I'll have my say.

01:45:11.399 --> 01:45:14.300
Go on. Double away, you two.
Left turn, double march!

01:45:14.669 --> 01:45:16.933
Move it! Move, move, move!

01:45:17.572 --> 01:45:23.067
Left, right, left, right.
Come on, double, double, double!

01:45:55.477 --> 01:45:59.937
- You're a clever boy, you are.
- I quit this army.

01:46:00.015 --> 01:46:02.142
- Don't be daft.
- Clever boy.

01:46:02.384 --> 01:46:06.445
What's the clever thing to do? Go crawling
to Williams the way you do, huh?

01:46:06.621 --> 01:46:08.555
Now just watch your big mouth.

01:46:09.691 --> 01:46:13.650
I'll kill that man if he lifts
one finger to me, one finger.

01:46:13.728 --> 01:46:17.494
- Yeah, go on. You're all shout.
- And I know how tough you are.

01:46:17.732 --> 01:46:19.461
Now watch your step.

01:46:26.007 --> 01:46:29.909
You useless article, made in Yorkshire,

01:46:31.212 --> 01:46:34.147
exported to the Middle East
and marked "Fragile!"

01:46:35.784 --> 01:46:41.950
Come on. Go on, you're the big man in the
cell. Did you hear what he said? Come on.

01:46:51.433 --> 01:46:53.663
What the hell is this now?

01:46:54.903 --> 01:46:58.361
Break it up, break it up, break it up now.

01:46:58.440 --> 01:47:02.308
Come on, come on, break it up.

01:47:02.410 --> 01:47:05.811
You're on Commandant's orders.
Get dressed, King, and get outside.

01:47:05.880 --> 01:47:09.111
- I've quit the army.
- Get dressed!

01:47:10.986 --> 01:47:16.652
I've finished with the army,
and this is what I think of British justice.

01:47:17.225 --> 01:47:20.717
Stark raving bonkers. Outside, all of you.

01:47:20.895 --> 01:47:23.159
King, what the hell's wrong with you?

01:47:23.331 --> 01:47:27.358
I've finished with the army,
so I don't wear the uniform.

01:47:27.435 --> 01:47:30.495
You're going into the Commandant
dressed like this, lad?

01:47:30.572 --> 01:47:34.099
Unless you've got a top hat
and a bone to put through me nose.

01:47:35.810 --> 01:47:39.109
That's the way you white folks think
that we dress back home.

01:47:39.314 --> 01:47:41.544
This ought to be one day he remembers.

01:47:41.616 --> 01:47:43.584
Come on, then. All right, double.

01:47:44.052 --> 01:47:50.150
Come on, double! Left, left, left, right, left.
Left, left, left, right, left.

01:48:27.195 --> 01:48:28.822
There you are, Roberts.

01:48:29.097 --> 01:48:31.395
What's the verdict? Medicine and duty?

01:48:31.666 --> 01:48:33.293
You go back to your cell, pick up your kit,

01:48:33.368 --> 01:48:35.063
and then I'm recommending you
for hospital.

01:48:35.136 --> 01:48:38.367
I wouldn't do that.
The RSM wouldn't like it.

01:48:40.108 --> 01:48:42.269
- I decide what's...
- You decide nothing.

01:48:42.343 --> 01:48:44.277
You just do what you're told.

01:48:47.849 --> 01:48:50.716
Look here, Roberts,
I'm making a full report about you.

01:48:50.785 --> 01:48:54.118
Well, you'd better,
because I'm fighting every one of you

01:48:54.189 --> 01:48:56.487
in this dirty, lousy dump.

01:48:58.526 --> 01:49:02.462
Every one of you. Every single one of you.

01:49:03.765 --> 01:49:07.531
Left, right, left, left, left, right, left,
left, right.

01:49:08.903 --> 01:49:10.734
You've had me for a soldier.

01:49:10.805 --> 01:49:12.397
Wouldn't get me in
the Boy Scouts after that.

01:49:12.474 --> 01:49:13.702
Shut up, lad.

01:49:13.775 --> 01:49:17.233
- King, attention!
- Mr. Harris.

01:49:17.512 --> 01:49:21.471
You may tell Mister Commandant
that Mr. Jacko King will see him now.

01:49:23.485 --> 01:49:25.077
Quiet down, you dumb lad.

01:49:36.364 --> 01:49:40.323
What are you doing, then? Get back, you...

01:50:07.796 --> 01:50:11.857
Horace, sit down. Don't stand up for me.
I've jagged in me rank.

01:50:24.679 --> 01:50:26.306
I recommend this brand,

01:50:27.515 --> 01:50:32.817
but I cannot recommend your hotel,
Horace. The service is lousy.

01:50:33.454 --> 01:50:34.443
Staff!

01:50:34.923 --> 01:50:38.791
Sir, he's round the bend, sir.
I can't do anything with him.

01:50:44.098 --> 01:50:48.296
So you don't like the hotel?

01:50:48.937 --> 01:50:51.167
Not since one of the guests died, no.

01:50:51.239 --> 01:50:54.231
Staff, get this mad man out.
Send the RSM to me.

01:50:54.943 --> 01:50:56.740
He's making the funeral arrangements, sir.

01:50:56.811 --> 01:50:59.336
- What?
- Stevens died, sir.

01:50:59.781 --> 01:51:02.306
- Well, why wasn't I told?
- You weren't here.

01:51:02.951 --> 01:51:05.579
Send the RSM to me
the minute he gets back.

01:51:06.254 --> 01:51:09.052
- Who died?
- George Stevens!

01:51:09.824 --> 01:51:11.416
Williams murdered him.

01:51:12.493 --> 01:51:15.189
- Get this maniac out. Out!
- Sir!

01:51:16.097 --> 01:51:20.124
King, double out, lad! Double! Double!

01:51:26.040 --> 01:51:27.029
Double!

01:51:29.143 --> 01:51:30.303
Horace.

01:51:33.381 --> 01:51:35.941
Williams murdered Stevens.

01:51:36.851 --> 01:51:40.116
Don't forget that. He murdered him.

01:52:00.708 --> 01:52:02.699
Right, get back to your details.

01:52:09.550 --> 01:52:11.279
Party, halt!

01:52:11.686 --> 01:52:13.813
Get those prisoners out of here,
Staff Harris.

01:52:13.888 --> 01:52:17.881
About turn, double march!

01:52:23.731 --> 01:52:26.393
Roberts imagines
that he's being persecuted.

01:52:30.171 --> 01:52:33.402
Imagines he was beaten up
by one of the staff, does he?

01:52:34.609 --> 01:52:35.735
Even that.

01:52:37.345 --> 01:52:38.642
So he was.

01:52:39.914 --> 01:52:42.508
- What did you say?
- So he was.

01:52:44.986 --> 01:52:49.252
- You realize I'll have to report that?
- Let's hope you do.

01:52:50.491 --> 01:52:52.618
- If it's true.
- You know it's true.

01:52:52.860 --> 01:52:55.761
Yes, Harris, but would you tell
the Commandant that?

01:52:57.799 --> 01:52:59.994
Yes. Yes, I will. I will.

01:53:01.235 --> 01:53:05.069
There will have to be an enquiry.
You'll have to give evidence.

01:53:05.406 --> 01:53:09.365
Yes, I know, but yours is the only evidence
the court will take seriously.

01:53:09.444 --> 01:53:13.505
After the RSM's testified that I'm useless
as a prison officer, followed by

01:53:14.115 --> 01:53:16.208
every screw he can muster
and Williams and...

01:53:16.284 --> 01:53:20.277
Of course I'll need evidence,
but this man's here for striking an officer.

01:53:21.222 --> 01:53:23.190
They'll have a very strong case, Harris.

01:53:23.257 --> 01:53:24.554
Evidence? If you don't move soon,

01:53:24.625 --> 01:53:27.025
you'll have all the evidence you need.
His coffin.

01:53:27.095 --> 01:53:29.825
All right, you two, get your kits.
You're going into solitary.

01:53:29.897 --> 01:53:34.357
About turn! Double in!
Left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right.

01:53:34.435 --> 01:53:35.732
Come on, move it.

01:53:36.304 --> 01:53:38.670
The men are not to come in here, Staff.

01:53:38.973 --> 01:53:42.136
- Well, my orders, sir, were...
- I'm giving the orders now,

01:53:42.543 --> 01:53:45.706
and I have a very serious complaint
against you, Williams.

01:53:45.780 --> 01:53:47.179
From Roberts, sir?

01:53:47.749 --> 01:53:49.410
And Staff Harris.

01:53:50.551 --> 01:53:52.143
His days are numbered.

01:53:53.254 --> 01:53:56.519
I've just had a word with the Commandant
and I'll answer any queries

01:53:56.591 --> 01:53:59.526
as to how I treat prisoners
at the Court of Enquiry, sir.

01:53:59.594 --> 01:54:01.152
I'll see the other prisoners now.

01:54:01.229 --> 01:54:02.753
In fairness, sir,
send for the RSM before you...

01:54:02.830 --> 01:54:04.730
I will conduct this my own way.

01:54:06.067 --> 01:54:07.694
- Have you any complaints?
- Sir.

01:54:07.769 --> 01:54:10.135
I want you to fix it for me
to get posted out of this cell, sir.

01:54:10.204 --> 01:54:13.662
I can't take much more of this shower.
Get me out of here, sir.

01:54:14.642 --> 01:54:16.633
You. You, any complaints?

01:54:22.917 --> 01:54:26.614
I've falsely confessed to the Commandant
that I half beat up Roberts,

01:54:26.754 --> 01:54:29.018
and that's why I'm going into solitary.

01:54:29.090 --> 01:54:30.990
I'm telling you,
the army's had me for a soldier

01:54:31.059 --> 01:54:32.617
if something's not done about this.

01:54:32.693 --> 01:54:33.921
Right, get out.

01:54:35.129 --> 01:54:37.996
I haven't always seen eye to eye
with you, Roberts,

01:54:38.733 --> 01:54:39.995
but good luck.

01:54:40.802 --> 01:54:42.997
McGrath, watch out for yourself.

01:54:43.137 --> 01:54:47.574
- Why is this man improperly dressed?
- Refuses to wear King's uniform.

01:54:50.578 --> 01:54:53.809
- Stand to attention.
- Oh, no. No, man.

01:54:55.249 --> 01:54:57.945
I don't recognize the army or the officers.

01:54:58.653 --> 01:55:01.349
- I quit.
- I said stand to attention.

01:55:02.323 --> 01:55:06.191
- You're talking to a civilian, Cuthbert.
- Give him to me, sir. I'll teach him.

01:55:06.260 --> 01:55:10.094
Joe, you tell me your visiting hours,
I'll come up and see you sometime.

01:55:10.164 --> 01:55:14.430
Harris, take this lunatic into the corridor
and keep him there till I'm ready for him.

01:55:14.502 --> 01:55:16.470
Yes, sir. After you, Mr. King.

01:55:19.240 --> 01:55:22.004
- See you later, Joe.
- Okay, Mr. King.

01:55:22.076 --> 01:55:23.373
Double out!

01:55:25.046 --> 01:55:26.070
Double!

01:55:28.182 --> 01:55:29.843
Bartlett, move it!

01:55:32.620 --> 01:55:36.681
You can see what we're up against, sir.
If you're easy on them,

01:55:36.891 --> 01:55:41.021
we won't be able to do
a damn thing with them, will we, sir?

01:55:41.863 --> 01:55:44.331
What the hell are these men doing
idling here in the corridor?

01:55:44.398 --> 01:55:45.626
- Orders, sir.
- Whose orders?

01:55:45.700 --> 01:55:46.689
M.O.'s.

01:55:47.001 --> 01:55:49.196
- What's going on here, sir?
- I'm giving these men a medical.

01:55:49.270 --> 01:55:51.135
On sick report, are they, sir? Why?

01:55:51.205 --> 01:55:53.571
It's not your place to question me,
Sergeant Major.

01:55:53.641 --> 01:55:55.768
Soon as you've passed them fit,
I want them, sir.

01:55:55.843 --> 01:55:58.038
I've had some complaints
about Williams' treatment of...

01:55:58.112 --> 01:55:59.977
Prisoners complaining,
we get that sometimes.

01:56:00.047 --> 01:56:02.515
King just tried it. Walked in...
Walked in, mind you, on the Commandant

01:56:02.583 --> 01:56:04.778
half-naked, just in his tribal feathers.

01:56:04.852 --> 01:56:07.821
What kind of a bloody fool
are you trying to make of me, sir?

01:56:07.889 --> 01:56:10.915
The complaint against Williams
came from Staff Harris.

01:56:16.297 --> 01:56:17.286
Harris.

01:56:20.701 --> 01:56:23.602
- What have you told him?
- I told him the truth, sir.

01:56:23.704 --> 01:56:26.366
The truth?
What the hell are you talking about?

01:56:26.440 --> 01:56:27.702
It's not your fault, sir, it's Williams'.

01:56:27.775 --> 01:56:30.676
It's me. Me! Who the hell runs this place?

01:56:31.179 --> 01:56:33.170
Retract all you've said, Charlie!

01:56:33.247 --> 01:56:35.181
Put your finger onto him, Bert. Get him.

01:56:35.249 --> 01:56:40.152
You telling me again how to run
this place, are you? Outside, Staff.

01:56:41.756 --> 01:56:44.452
Sergeant Major,
Roberts is going into hospital.

01:56:44.825 --> 01:56:46.759
Keep him here, sir, in a cell.

01:56:46.827 --> 01:56:49.125
Be better if you attend him here, sir.

01:56:49.197 --> 01:56:50.289
Sergeant Major!

01:56:50.364 --> 01:56:53.458
In 25 years,
I've never known a balls-up like it!

01:56:53.734 --> 01:56:58.194
From now on, I'm checking on every man,
every prisoner, every staff!

01:56:58.339 --> 01:56:59.931
- Staff Harris!
- Sir!

01:57:00.107 --> 01:57:02.541
Report on your brother officers,
would you?

01:57:02.610 --> 01:57:07.775
Try and undermine my authority, eh?
A useless article like you, Harris.

01:57:08.149 --> 01:57:09.741
You're under close arrest.

01:57:09.817 --> 01:57:11.307
No, don't push me too hard.
You're gonna need

01:57:11.385 --> 01:57:13.945
- all the help you can get!
- I'm breaking you!

01:57:14.555 --> 01:57:18.889
Now, before you're confined
to your quarters, do something useful.

01:57:19.594 --> 01:57:21.721
- Get a cell ready for Roberts.
- No.

01:57:22.296 --> 01:57:24.423
Help Roberts with his kit.
He's going to hospital.

01:57:24.498 --> 01:57:26.557
I'm in charge of discipline here, sir!

01:57:26.634 --> 01:57:29.228
Then you look after your department,
and I'll look after mine.

01:57:29.303 --> 01:57:31.271
Don't try and cancel out my orders.

01:57:31.339 --> 01:57:34.570
I have the final word
where the men's health is concerned.

01:57:40.681 --> 01:57:42.376
Perhaps I was hasty.

01:57:45.786 --> 01:57:48.311
- I've had a day of it.
- Yeah, so has Roberts.

01:57:48.889 --> 01:57:50.516
He's going into hospital.

01:57:51.359 --> 01:57:55.056
It's a pity you didn't put Roberts
and Stevens on light duties, sir.

01:57:55.229 --> 01:57:56.526
What?

01:57:57.465 --> 01:58:01.128
I thought Stevens looked delicate,
but that wasn't my worry, was it?

01:58:01.669 --> 01:58:05.105
- What are you driving at?
- Were they fit?

01:58:05.373 --> 01:58:07.603
Let's start with Stevens, was he fit?

01:58:07.675 --> 01:58:11.611
If I understand you right, by God,
you're going to be in serious trouble.

01:58:11.712 --> 01:58:15.239
- Did you give him a medical?
- He did not. I was there, wasn't I?

01:58:15.783 --> 01:58:17.876
Passed him A-1 fit for punishment.

01:58:18.119 --> 01:58:21.384
I punished him alongside Roberts,
King, Bartlett and McGrath.

01:58:21.689 --> 01:58:22.951
Well, he's dead.

01:58:23.024 --> 01:58:25.959
Heat exhaustion, sun stroke and...

01:58:26.027 --> 01:58:30.487
Stevens was a sick man and I only caught
on when it was too late, I'll swear to it.

01:58:30.598 --> 01:58:32.998
Your neglect lumbered me
with a dead man.

01:58:33.634 --> 01:58:37.331
Now, you put Roberts into hospital
and give me the chance to break you.

01:58:37.938 --> 01:58:40.566
- Sergeant Major.
- Don't let them get away with it.

01:58:40.641 --> 01:58:42.905
Sergeant Major, he's trying blackmail.
You heard him.

01:58:42.977 --> 01:58:44.911
I'm putting Roberts in a cell.

01:58:45.479 --> 01:58:47.845
Look, I gave an order.

01:58:48.149 --> 01:58:49.673
Get Roberts into hospital, sir.

01:58:49.750 --> 01:58:52.583
A court martial will break you, sir,
not Williams.

01:58:52.653 --> 01:58:53.677
Shut your trap, Harris.

01:58:53.754 --> 01:58:56.655
The Commandant's got to check on
this lot now. I won't be slow in telling him.

01:58:56.724 --> 01:58:58.749
It's me who's gonna bust you, Bert.
I'm sorry.

01:58:58.826 --> 01:59:00.259
I'll double Harris to his quarters, sir.

01:59:00.328 --> 01:59:04.424
That's not the kind of doubling
you're gonna do. Get Roberts out.

01:59:04.498 --> 01:59:06.159
Me? I'm running this place.

01:59:06.233 --> 01:59:09.600
You ain't running this place, Bert.
Williams is, look at him.

01:59:10.137 --> 01:59:12.401
He took over days ago,
and you still haven't caught on.

01:59:12.473 --> 01:59:15.135
I'm reporting everything
that's happened here.

01:59:15.443 --> 01:59:19.243
It's you I'm after, but I won't worry
too much if you go down with him.

01:59:20.047 --> 01:59:22.607
I'm phoning for an ambulance.
Roberts is going to hospital.

01:59:22.683 --> 01:59:25.083
Then I'm going to see
the area commander.

01:59:26.087 --> 01:59:29.682
Try and blackmail me, would you,
Williams? Well, try it. Go on, try it.

01:59:31.459 --> 01:59:33.393
Have you anything else to say?

01:59:34.128 --> 01:59:37.427
Yes, sir. You won't do any better
than Stevens on that hill.

01:59:38.799 --> 01:59:40.528
What the hell are you doing there?

01:59:40.601 --> 01:59:45.004
Get back, do you hear me!
I'm giving you an order!

01:59:45.373 --> 01:59:48.968
- Get away from that door!
- Move along, lads.

01:59:55.049 --> 01:59:57.540
- Thank you very much, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

02:00:02.056 --> 02:00:06.015
Right, Bartlett, I'm putting you
in another cell. Follow me.

02:00:07.294 --> 02:00:12.459
I knew I could trust you, Staff.
It was getting very dicey in there, Staff.

02:00:12.733 --> 02:00:16.260
Roberts, get your kit.
I'm moving you into a Ionely cell.

02:00:16.604 --> 02:00:19.198
Why don't you catch on?

02:00:20.007 --> 02:00:23.636
Your days of turning men
into toy soldiers are over.

02:00:23.878 --> 02:00:27.814
I run this place. Me.
I say what goes and what don't go.

02:00:28.849 --> 02:00:31.613
Williams, I told you when you came here
I stand by my staff.

02:00:31.685 --> 02:00:33.949
- We've gotta do some quick thinking.
- You won't get me into another

02:00:34.021 --> 02:00:35.784
bloody mess like this again.
I'm putting you on the gate.

02:00:35.856 --> 02:00:37.323
Listen, Harris and the M.O.
Are going on report...

02:00:37.391 --> 02:00:39.484
You're a bit too hot even for me!

02:00:39.660 --> 02:00:41.924
You don't seem to understand
we stand together!

02:00:41.996 --> 02:00:44.521
You work alongside me,
and I'll show you how it's done.

02:00:44.598 --> 02:00:46.930
You don't belt them in this game,
you break them, gently break them,

02:00:47.001 --> 02:00:49.299
then you build them up again
into men, into soldiers!

02:00:49.370 --> 02:00:50.894
Listen. We throw it all onto Harris
and the...

02:00:50.971 --> 02:00:53.496
You listening to me?
People listen to me when I'm talking.

02:00:53.574 --> 02:00:54.598
Don't you ever forget that.

02:00:54.675 --> 02:00:55.869
Will you shut up a minute?
I'll tell you how!

02:00:55.943 --> 02:00:58.036
You pay attention.
I've got enough on my plate without you...

02:00:58.112 --> 02:01:01.445
You trying to give me orders?
No one does that!

02:01:10.891 --> 02:01:12.916
I run this place. Me.

02:01:13.761 --> 02:01:15.888
I say what goes and what don't go.

02:01:18.032 --> 02:01:21.024
Even if you go to the Commandant,
think he'll listen?

02:01:21.936 --> 02:01:25.394
He's saying yes to me
before I've even walked through the door.

02:01:27.141 --> 02:01:30.941
Now, get this place cleaned up.
It's a pigsty.

02:01:34.248 --> 02:01:35.613
Carry on, Staff.

02:01:37.351 --> 02:01:41.253
In 25 years, I've never known anybody...

02:01:41.622 --> 02:01:44.785
Never, not in 25 years, never.

02:01:47.027 --> 02:01:49.587
You're on your own now, Williams.

02:01:52.733 --> 02:01:54.997
No, you're still with me, Roberts.

02:01:56.504 --> 02:01:58.233
Just you and me this time.

02:02:01.642 --> 02:02:03.007
Don't touch him!

02:02:03.711 --> 02:02:06.111
Don't muck it up, boys. Don't touch him!

02:02:10.985 --> 02:02:16.184
You'll muck it up! Don't touch him.
We've won.

02:02:16.290 --> 02:02:20.192
We've won. You'll muck it up.

02:02:32.673 --> 02:02:35.233
Double! Double!

02:02:38.145 --> 02:02:39.703
Double!
