WEBVTT

00:01.534 --> 00:05.265
Put down that shade. I don't want
Wilson to know about the surprise party.

00:05.338 --> 00:10.833
You won't believe who just RSVP'd.
Albert Einsteirs nephew, Corky.

00:12.312 --> 00:13.609
- Corky Einstein?
- Yeah.

00:13.680 --> 00:17.047
Yeah. He and Wilson went
to sleep-away camp together.

00:17.484 --> 00:20.715
Let's not forget the most
important guest at this birthday party.

00:20.787 --> 00:22.254
Wilsors niece.

00:22.322 --> 00:26.281
Oh, yeah. Her too, but the '53
Studebaker she's driving down here.

00:26.393 --> 00:29.157
- That was Wilsors dad's car.
- His mom was gonna sell it.

00:29.262 --> 00:30.889
But I convinced her...

00:32.932 --> 00:36.026
...to give it to Wilson instead.
It's a fabulous idea, I think.

00:36.936 --> 00:40.463
And as his birthday present
to Wilson, he's gonna fix it all up.

00:41.074 --> 00:43.235
You know,
maybe if I click my heels together,

00:43.343 --> 00:45.504
I can get back to Kansas before dinner.

00:46.112 --> 00:48.876
That's a really good idea.

00:48.948 --> 00:50.609
Is Wilsors mom coming?

00:50.683 --> 00:55.211
No, no. She couldn't make it.
She's in Nebraska chasing twisters.

00:55.855 --> 00:58.323
Hey, everybody! I got the photo!

00:58.391 --> 01:02.122
Ooh, I can't wait to see
this picture of Wilson as a little boy.

01:02.896 --> 01:04.557
Aw.

01:06.000 --> 01:12.074

01:59.486 --> 02:01.852
There's the Studebaker!

02:01.955 --> 02:05.220
Will you not drool over the
Studebaker and spend a couple minutes

02:05.291 --> 02:08.657
- being polite to Wilsors niece?
- All right, I'll wait.

02:08.761 --> 02:11.321
Hi, I'm Willow.

02:11.397 --> 02:14.264
Hi, I'm Jill.
It is so nice to meet you.

02:14.334 --> 02:17.861
Come on in.
Meet the family. This is, uh...

02:17.937 --> 02:21.236
No, wait. Let me guess.
I'm picking up a vibe here.

02:21.307 --> 02:23.400
Brad, Randy, Mark.

02:23.476 --> 02:27.435
And judging by the scent of Pennzoil,
you must be Tim.

02:27.714 --> 02:30.547
It's 10-W30 all-weather.

02:30.617 --> 02:33.780
- Can I take your bag? Whatever?
- Yeah.

02:33.887 --> 02:35.411
Willow Wilson. Cool name.

02:35.488 --> 02:38.946
My full name
is Willow Branch Leaf Wilson.

02:39.893 --> 02:42.555
But I pruned it back.

02:44.330 --> 02:45.558
Can I get you anything?

02:45.632 --> 02:49.966
No, that's all right. I had
a butterscotch rice cake in the car.

02:51.938 --> 02:54.566
Eating in a classic Studebaker?

02:54.641 --> 02:57.371
I'll get the crumbs
out of there with my car vac.

02:57.443 --> 03:00.207
Wilsors told us so much about you.

03:00.313 --> 03:03.339
He said that you
were a German Philosophy major.

03:03.416 --> 03:07.284
Yes. It was a great stepping stone
to the work I do now.

03:07.353 --> 03:10.254
- What do you do now?
- Give massages.

03:12.358 --> 03:14.019
Very cool.

03:14.093 --> 03:16.425
I'll get it.

03:17.397 --> 03:21.857
What exactly is the connection between
German Philosophy and massage?

03:21.935 --> 03:25.701
Read a little Nietzsche
and see how tense you get.

03:25.772 --> 03:27.831
- Ah!
- Hold on a minute. Just a minute.

03:27.907 --> 03:30.603
- Willow, it's, uh... It's for you.
- Oh, yeah.

03:30.677 --> 03:34.340
I gave your number to a few people.
Is it David, Felipe or Cameron?

03:35.481 --> 03:38.245
Is it David, Felipe or Cameron?

03:39.619 --> 03:42.554
OK, OK. Settle down.

03:42.622 --> 03:44.487
Sergei.

03:45.191 --> 03:47.056
Ugh! I don't want to talk to him.

03:47.126 --> 03:51.085
He's an insensitive egomaniac
who refuses to share his feelings.

03:55.735 --> 03:58.431
She won't talk to you
because you're a guy.

04:09.315 --> 04:13.547
Hey, Wilson. Yeah.
Could you help me with the hot rod?

04:13.620 --> 04:16.589
Well, the boys can't.
They're... being punished.

04:17.790 --> 04:19.348
So's Jill.

04:20.526 --> 04:23.427
Just take a minute. Please? OK, great.

04:24.264 --> 04:26.027
He'll be here in a couple of minutes!

04:26.132 --> 04:32.093
My relationship with Sergei was
outwardly passionate but inwardly cold.

04:32.205 --> 04:35.265
I'm sure you've been
in relationships like that.

04:35.341 --> 04:37.002
Tons.

04:38.611 --> 04:40.841
Brr.

04:42.682 --> 04:44.013
Wilsors coming!

04:44.083 --> 04:46.517
Willow, Willow, come!
Um, hide out in the garage.

04:46.586 --> 04:47.553
OK, OK.

04:47.654 --> 04:51.385
Duck down in the car. When you pop up,
don't block the view of the dashboard.

04:53.726 --> 04:56.194
Hey, Wilson.
Hey, you gotta watch your step

04:56.262 --> 04:58.389
because we've had
an electrical problem.

04:58.464 --> 05:01.524
How badly was Tim hurt?

05:03.436 --> 05:06.371
Surprise!

05:06.439 --> 05:08.566
- Gotcha!
- Oh, my gosh!

05:08.641 --> 05:14.341
Look at all these people!
Corky Einstein from bunk seven!

05:15.014 --> 05:17.983
I can't believe
all of you did this for me!

05:18.051 --> 05:20.986
Wilson, you mean so much to me
and to everybody in this room.

05:21.054 --> 05:23.420
- Oh, thank you, Jill.
- Hey, Wilson, come with me.

05:23.523 --> 05:25.548
I got a great surprise.
Come on! Come on!

05:25.625 --> 05:28.526
- Happy Birthday, Wilson!
- Were you surprised?

05:30.096 --> 05:32.587
All right, all right!
Come here! Come here!

05:33.499 --> 05:37.663
Oh, my! It's a '53 Studebaker.

05:37.770 --> 05:43.003
It's a '53 Studebaker Commander.
V8 engine, automatic tranny.

05:43.076 --> 05:47.035
- Tim, this is my father's car.
- Happy birthday, Wilson.

05:47.113 --> 05:49.877
How did you get it here?

05:49.949 --> 05:52.474
I drove it.

05:52.552 --> 05:54.417
Surprise, Uncle Wilson.

05:54.487 --> 05:56.250
Willow!

05:56.322 --> 06:00.622
Oh, Willow!
What a perfect present!

06:00.693 --> 06:03.457
We'll knock out the bumps
and fix the electrical system.

06:03.563 --> 06:05.656
No, I was talking about my niece.

06:05.732 --> 06:09.896
It has been so long since I've been
around family. It is so good to see you.

06:09.969 --> 06:11.436
It's great to see you too.

06:11.504 --> 06:14.200
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Let's take a ride in the car!

06:14.273 --> 06:18.437
Well, maybe later. Right now I've
gotta catch up with my long lost niece.

06:21.180 --> 06:23.705
What about the long lost car?!

06:26.586 --> 06:30.249
Oh, Rolf. Thank you for taking time out
from your psychiatry practice.

06:30.323 --> 06:32.883
- Did you have a good time?
- I'm not sure.

06:32.959 --> 06:36.895
I'll go home and analyze myself
and get back to you.

06:38.197 --> 06:41.428
My mom and dad were hippies.
They split up right after I was born.

06:41.501 --> 06:44.868
I lived with my mom in Berkeley
and then with my dad in Kathmandu.

06:44.937 --> 06:47.599
- I was moving all the time.
- I know what that's like.

06:47.673 --> 06:51.234
My dad was an Army colonel and we
were always moving around to bases.

06:51.344 --> 06:55.610
Probably some of the ones
my mom tried to shut down.

06:55.681 --> 06:58.912
Probably.
So where do you live now?

06:58.985 --> 07:02.751
I'm staying with friends in Chicago.
But it's just another temporary stop.

07:02.822 --> 07:06.053
I'd love to be able
to put down roots somewhere.

07:06.125 --> 07:09.583
You're lucky to be able
to have such a nice family.

07:09.662 --> 07:11.994
I bet it feels great to be grounded.

07:12.064 --> 07:15.761
Yeah, especially when Tim's
doing electrical work.

07:20.506 --> 07:22.736
All right, guys.
Finished with the dishes.

07:22.809 --> 07:24.834
Who wants to go stare
at the Studebaker?

07:24.911 --> 07:26.469
- No, thanks.
- Pass.

07:26.579 --> 07:28.911
I think I'd rather do the dishes again.

07:29.982 --> 07:33.645
Excuse me, Jill. I need to go call
the airport about my flight to Chicago.

07:33.719 --> 07:35.380
- I'll be right back.
- OK.

07:35.455 --> 07:38.754
Oh, great punch. Great presents.

07:38.825 --> 07:41.157
Great party.

07:41.227 --> 07:43.388
Oh, Jill, it was so hard to say goodbye.

07:43.463 --> 07:46.227
Well, maybe you shouldn't
say goodbye to everybody.

07:46.299 --> 07:49.132
- What do you mean?
- I was just talking to Willow,

07:49.202 --> 07:51.898
and she really wants
to set down roots somewhere.

07:51.971 --> 07:56.931
And I know this guy who lives alone
and could probably use some company.

07:57.009 --> 07:59.876
Well, I don't think she and Al
would get along together.

08:02.582 --> 08:04.641
Honey, I'm talking about you.

08:05.618 --> 08:09.349
Well, nothing would make me happier
than to have Willow move in with me.

08:09.422 --> 08:13.085
Why would a vibrant young woman
want to live with her middle-aged uncle?

08:13.159 --> 08:17.926
Wilson, you are not some old fogy.
You're fun and you're family to her.

08:18.030 --> 08:21.261
Well, I got a flight
first thing in the morning.

08:21.334 --> 08:23.802
You mind taking me to the airport,
Uncle Wilson?

08:23.870 --> 08:29.172
Well, not at all, unless you'd like to
stay in Detroit for a while... with me?

08:29.242 --> 08:33.611
Wow! That's really nice.
I don't know what to say.

08:33.679 --> 08:34.907
"Yes" would be good.

08:36.015 --> 08:39.280
I've got tons of space.
I could clear out my Tiki room.

08:39.352 --> 08:41.785
The Tiki room. That is a great room.

08:41.854 --> 08:45.221
And the parrot that lives in there now
just doesn't appreciate it.

08:46.492 --> 08:49.655
I should warn you I'm not
the easiest person to live with.

08:49.762 --> 08:53.698
I keep very odd hours
and I'm a little eccentric.

08:53.766 --> 08:55.734
So is the parrot.

08:57.803 --> 09:01.569
Well, I'd be willing if you would.
What do you say?

09:02.808 --> 09:06.107
- Tell Polly to pack her bags!
- Yeah!

09:07.580 --> 09:09.480
Let's go for a ride in the Studebaker.

09:09.549 --> 09:12.416
I can't talk about the Studebaker.
Willow's moving in,

09:12.485 --> 09:14.646
and I've got to get her settled.

09:16.522 --> 09:19.855
Willow's moving in? It took a lot
of work to get the Studebaker here.

09:19.926 --> 09:21.757
He wants to spend time with his niece?

09:21.827 --> 09:24.660
Tim, I know it sounds ridiculous,
but to some people,

09:24.730 --> 09:27.062
family is more important than cars.

09:27.133 --> 09:29.101
Well, immediate family, sure.

09:29.201 --> 09:31.465
But Willow is just
his brother's daughter.

09:31.537 --> 09:34.199
The Studebaker
is his father's car.

09:35.141 --> 09:39.305
You should be happy for Wilson. He's
finally got some family in his life.

09:39.378 --> 09:42.347
Oh, finally?
What am I, smoked chub?

09:43.449 --> 09:45.974
Where did he get the idea
he needed family anyway?

09:46.452 --> 09:50.479
Jill, Uncle Wilson said it was you
who suggested that I stay with him.

09:50.556 --> 09:52.820
I just wanted to thank you.

09:56.395 --> 09:58.829
So it was you all along.

10:02.535 --> 10:06.096
That's really hitting me below the belt,
I'll tell you that right now.

10:15.648 --> 10:18.173
<i>Hi. Welcome back to Tool Time
and our special guest,</i>

10:18.250 --> 10:21.151
classic car collector,
George "Sparky" Anderson.

10:21.220 --> 10:24.314
Now, Sparky, you've been
restoring automobiles for 30 years.

10:24.390 --> 10:27.655
How are classic cars different
from modern cars?

10:28.661 --> 10:30.390
They're older, Al.

10:33.099 --> 10:36.865
I mean, you gotta be at least 25 years
old to be a classic car. Right, Tim?

10:36.936 --> 10:39.097
- Right.
- And they don't have the features:

10:39.171 --> 10:42.868
Cruise control,
anti-lock breaks, uh, air bags.

10:42.942 --> 10:45.604
They drive like trucks,
sometimes get worse mileage

10:45.678 --> 10:49.444
- and harder on the environment.
- Why would anyone want a classic car?

10:49.548 --> 10:52.312
Because they're cool!

10:54.020 --> 10:56.488
- I mean, these aren't just vehicles.
- No.

10:56.555 --> 11:00.321
These are works of art. I mean,
Tim, what would you rather own,

11:00.426 --> 11:03.259
- a Buick or a Botticelli?
- A Buick.

11:03.329 --> 11:05.388
It's hard to get Italian parts.

11:06.732 --> 11:08.393
You're right, Tim. You're right.

11:08.467 --> 11:11.197
Uh, in order to demonstrate,
I brought along a video

11:11.270 --> 11:14.034
that shows some of my
favorite classic automobiles.

11:14.106 --> 11:17.371
Heidi, the video monitor, please.

11:17.443 --> 11:20.742
- Here you are, Tim.
- Thank you, Heidi. Let's take a look.

11:20.813 --> 11:23.714
Oh, look at that beauty.

11:23.783 --> 11:26.308
'48 Olds coupe.

11:26.385 --> 11:30.116
Four thousand pounds of Detroit steel

11:30.189 --> 11:32.350
- storming down the street.
- Boy!

11:32.425 --> 11:35.883
Reminds me of Al's mom
looking for a smorgasbord, huh?

11:41.100 --> 11:44.001
If I was to buy a classic car,
you know what it would be?

11:44.070 --> 11:47.506
- What, Al?
- An "Al-fa Romeo."

11:50.409 --> 11:52.570
Moving right along here, um...

11:52.645 --> 11:55.773
That's a '55 Chevy Bel Air, isn't it?

11:55.848 --> 12:00.979
Oh, look at that grill. She
almost looks like she's smiling at you.

12:01.053 --> 12:04.181
The first time I was in the back seat
of one of those, I was smiling.

12:04.256 --> 12:07.623
You were with a girl.

12:07.693 --> 12:10.059
No, I was just happy
to be in the back seat.

12:12.064 --> 12:15.591
- Hm.
- I was kidding about the Alfa Romeo.

12:15.668 --> 12:19.229
- I know.
- I'd really like a Cadillac Al-Dorado.

12:20.673 --> 12:22.834
Or maybe an Al-Camino.

12:24.543 --> 12:27.842
How about a Mercedes 280 S-Al?

12:31.016 --> 12:33.883
- Let's move on to the next car.
- Let me ask you a question.

12:33.953 --> 12:38.890
Let's say a guy bends over backwards to
give a guy a '53 Studebaker Commander.

12:38.958 --> 12:41.290
- Oh, I love that car.
- Good design. It is.

12:41.360 --> 12:44.124
And that same guy offered
to restore it for the first guy.

12:44.196 --> 12:46.528
- I love that guy.
- That's right.

12:46.599 --> 12:50.262
And then the second guy has a
distant relative show up. Let's say...

12:50.336 --> 12:55.035
...a niece. Who are you spending
time with, the niece or the car?

12:55.107 --> 12:58.975
- Please, Tim! Isn't it obvious?
- It is to me. But tell the audience.

12:59.044 --> 13:00.534
I'd spend time with the niece.

13:02.681 --> 13:04.979
Nothing more important
than family, right?

13:05.050 --> 13:07.610
Yes, exactly my point. Of course it was.

13:07.720 --> 13:10.689
We'll be back with more questions
after these messages.

13:10.756 --> 13:14.783
Binford is proud to welcome
our new sponsor, Saginaw Cheese.

13:14.860 --> 13:17.021
Cheese, it's good!

13:23.903 --> 13:27.737
- What smells?
- It's Brad.

13:27.807 --> 13:31.174
What have you been doing,
rolling around in carpet freshener?

13:32.778 --> 13:36.612
It's my new scent: patchouli.
I happen to know Willow likes it.

13:36.682 --> 13:38.843
I'm gonna ask her
to go to the coffeehouse.

13:38.951 --> 13:41.249
Better ask for a table outside.

13:44.824 --> 13:48.487
So, what makes you think she's gonna
want to go to a coffeehouse with you?

13:48.561 --> 13:50.188
Because after a guy like Sergei,

13:50.262 --> 13:53.322
she's gonna want a man that
makes her feel secure and centered.

13:53.399 --> 13:56.766
Like a high school junior who reeks?

14:00.272 --> 14:04.003
Maybe I should wash this stuff off.
I'm starting to feel a little dizzy.

14:04.710 --> 14:07.042
- Hi, guys.
- Hey.

14:07.112 --> 14:10.411
Ah, thanks for vacuuming.

14:13.085 --> 14:15.019
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.

14:15.087 --> 14:18.181
<i>There's a guy on Tool Time
that shares your point of view.</i>

14:18.257 --> 14:21.124
That all watermelons should be seedless?

14:23.062 --> 14:25.587
No. That spending time with one's niece

14:25.664 --> 14:28.565
is as important as spending time
with one's classic car.

14:28.634 --> 14:30.397
Oh. Well, duh.

14:31.770 --> 14:35.501
Wilson is having such a good time
with Willow being here.

14:35.574 --> 14:38.407
They've been going to museums
and poetry readings.

14:38.477 --> 14:42.106
Last night they went
to the Estonian Comedy Festival.

14:42.181 --> 14:44.411
They're famous
for their comedy over there.

14:44.483 --> 14:46.007
I am Yergi.

14:46.085 --> 14:51.455
Welcome to the show. I stayed at hotel
so small my goat slept standing up.

14:51.523 --> 14:54.356
But I kid!

14:54.426 --> 14:58.988
No. Willow, she's just like the daughter
that Wilson never had.

14:59.064 --> 15:00.793
It's the best that happened to him.

15:00.866 --> 15:02.891
He's in his yard.
I'm gonna go talk to him.

15:02.968 --> 15:05.436
There's no rush
to fix up that Studebaker.

15:05.504 --> 15:07.369
I'm ready whenever he's ready.

15:09.041 --> 15:11.771
Hey, Wilson.

15:11.844 --> 15:16.144
He's getting his costume for the
Renaissance Faire we're going to.

15:16.215 --> 15:19.082
- Hi, Willow. That sounds like fun.
- Yeah.

15:19.151 --> 15:24.214
So did the Ethiopian puppet show
and karaoke night at the VFW.

15:25.491 --> 15:27.516
I've been to the
VFW thing with him. Yeah.

15:27.593 --> 15:31.723
<i>Nothing quite like two
retired admirals singing Muskrat Love.</i>

15:33.065 --> 15:36.228
Well, maybe next time,
you can go in my place.

15:36.335 --> 15:40.362
I'm, um, going back
to Chicago tomorrow.

15:40.439 --> 15:43.135
Oh. What's Wilson think about that?

15:43.208 --> 15:44.334
He doesn't know yet.

15:44.410 --> 15:47.641
I figured I'd wait till after the
Renaissance Faire to tell him.

15:47.713 --> 15:50.546
I'm afraid bad news
might affect his jousting.

15:52.384 --> 15:55.251
What happened? You guys
were having so much fun together.

15:55.321 --> 15:58.415
We were at first.
But now I'm feeling smothered.

15:58.490 --> 16:02.426
He wants to be with me
every minute of every day. It's...

16:02.494 --> 16:04.189
It's too much for me.

16:04.263 --> 16:06.094
Have you tried talking to him?

16:06.165 --> 16:10.534
It wouldn't do any good. The men
in my family are very controlling.

16:10.636 --> 16:14.163
It doesn't seem right
to just skip out on the guy, though.

16:14.239 --> 16:18.903
<i>I don't think I have a choice. I believe
it's the Bhagavad Gita that says,</i>

16:18.978 --> 16:22.539
"A bird can only soar
if the sky has no bounds."

16:22.614 --> 16:25.174
Oh, yeah.
I can see it. Yeah.

16:26.485 --> 16:29.454
You can understand how being
so confined invalidates me,

16:29.521 --> 16:32.285
how it negates
the very core of my being.

16:32.358 --> 16:35.657
Oh, yes. Oh, yeah.

16:35.728 --> 16:38.822
- The heart goes with...
- See?

16:38.897 --> 16:42.060
- See, you do understand.
- Oh, yeah. Perfectly.

16:43.569 --> 16:46.868
Why can't Uncle Wilson be like you?
You take in everything.

16:46.939 --> 16:50.067
And then with a wise knowing grunt,
you convey your empathy.

16:50.142 --> 16:53.077
Well, it's just
something I do naturally...

16:54.880 --> 16:58.839
If only every man was as evolved as you.

17:00.819 --> 17:03.185
Yeah.
It's unfortunate, isn't it? Yes.

17:03.288 --> 17:05.188
Yeah. Yeah.

17:09.395 --> 17:13.161
Hey, you're not gonna believe this.
I'm evolved.

17:15.768 --> 17:20.102
And, um, Willow is gonna leave.

17:20.172 --> 17:23.471
Oh, my God! She's leaving?
Wilson is gonna be crushed.

17:23.541 --> 17:27.705
<i>I tried to talk her out of it. All she
did was quote from In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida.</i>

17:28.146 --> 17:29.705
- What did you say?
- I tried to...

17:29.782 --> 17:34.685
Hidy, hither and yon, good neighbors.
How fare ye this glorious eve?

17:34.753 --> 17:37.916
How fare we?
We fare fine. How fare ye?

17:38.957 --> 17:41.289
I've got an hour
before the Renaissance Faire.

17:41.360 --> 17:44.124
How would you like
to show me the Studebaker?

17:44.229 --> 17:47.357
Oh, great idea! I've always said
that there's nothing better

17:47.433 --> 17:50.368
for companionship than a car.

17:52.204 --> 17:54.695
When have you ever said that?

17:54.773 --> 17:58.709
Tim, why don't you take Wilson
in the garage and show him

17:58.777 --> 18:03.874
how fulfilling his life will be now that
he's sharing it with an automobile?

18:03.949 --> 18:05.780
- Ah, got ya.
- Yeah.

18:05.851 --> 18:09.116
Come hither.
We will repair to my repair shop.

18:09.188 --> 18:11.952
Verily, sire. Lead on, MacTim.

18:13.459 --> 18:17.020
There she is. With this Studebaker
by your side, you'll never be lonely.

18:17.096 --> 18:20.930
Yes. When we get it all fixed up,
Willow and I can go on trips together.

18:20.999 --> 18:25.231
Well, you could,
but this particular model of Studebaker

18:25.304 --> 18:28.034
runs a lot better
with just one person in it.

18:28.107 --> 18:31.668
You know, Tim, you and Jill
have been acting strangely.

18:31.743 --> 18:34.871
Something very odd
is going on around here.

18:39.051 --> 18:43.010
You know, a lot of guys couldn't
get away with that codpiece look.

18:43.088 --> 18:45.955
But on you? Fantastic.

18:46.024 --> 18:48.891
There's something you're
trying to tell me. What is it?

18:48.961 --> 18:52.089
- None of my business. Talk to Willow.
- Willow?

18:52.164 --> 18:54.860
She's... she's...
she's kind of unappy.

18:55.434 --> 18:59.666
- That's all there is?
- She feels like you're smothering her.

19:00.806 --> 19:03.866
- That's it?
- I think she wants to leave.

19:05.377 --> 19:07.811
Leave?

19:07.880 --> 19:11.213
Hi. How do you like my costume?

19:11.283 --> 19:13.410
Going as Mrs. Gutenberg.

19:16.421 --> 19:20.187
I've never seen
a lovelier Bible printer's wife.

19:21.059 --> 19:24.153
Uncle Wilson, what's wrong?

19:24.229 --> 19:26.197
Tim, did you say something to him?

19:26.265 --> 19:29.632
I didn't mean to. He was...
He was fiddling with his codpiece

19:29.735 --> 19:31.828
and it just popped out.

19:36.341 --> 19:39.799
No. Let me rephrase that.
What I...

19:39.878 --> 19:44.110
I'm sorry, Uncle Wilson. I, um...

19:44.183 --> 19:46.344
I don't know how to put this.

19:47.786 --> 19:51.449
- There's this quote from Joseph Conrad.
- The fat guy who played Cannon.

19:54.092 --> 19:56.652
No, the novelist.

19:56.762 --> 20:00.095
He said,
"We live as we dream... alone."

20:00.165 --> 20:02.793
Yes. And as the French
essayist Montaigne said,

20:02.868 --> 20:07.635
"In solitude alone
can man know true freedom."

20:10.509 --> 20:12.272
You know what's interesting?

20:12.344 --> 20:16.110
When you speak real slow like that,
French sounds a lot like English.

20:23.589 --> 20:26.353
So... so you
understand what I'm saying?

20:26.425 --> 20:30.657
Yes, I do. And, Willow, even though
I want you to live your own life,

20:30.729 --> 20:33.823
- there's something that I have to say.
- What's that?

20:33.899 --> 20:36.868
I really want you...

20:36.969 --> 20:40.336
...to consider the words of the Bible:

20:40.439 --> 20:43.306
"He who is alone and falleth..."

20:43.375 --> 20:47.209
"...hath not another
to help him up." Ecclesiastes.

20:47.279 --> 20:51.943
"Everybody loves somebody sometime."

20:57.522 --> 21:00.685
Martin-comma-Dean.

21:03.195 --> 21:05.891
Willow, I'm sorry I smothered you.

21:05.964 --> 21:08.432
But I'm just kind of new
at this family thing.

21:08.500 --> 21:12.960
So am I. I'm just not used
to this much attention.

21:13.038 --> 21:16.599
Willow, I'd like you to stay.

21:18.577 --> 21:21.876
Maybe we should
give this another chance.

21:24.082 --> 21:27.643
And if, uh, you need any advice,
I'm right over the fence.

21:27.753 --> 21:29.243
Thanks.

21:31.490 --> 21:34.459
You know, Tim's a very wise man.

21:34.559 --> 21:36.891
Oh, yes. I know.

21:50.575 --> 21:53.510
Let's say you're working
on your classic car in your garage.

21:53.578 --> 21:56.479
You're hot and sweaty
and you need instant refreshment.

21:56.548 --> 21:59.813
- What do you reach for?
- Cheese!

21:59.885 --> 22:04.049
- Oh, but not just any cheese!
- Saginaw Cheese!

22:04.156 --> 22:06.522
Cheese, it's good!
