00:10.532 --> 00:12.621
You became the head

00:12.795 --> 00:16.146
- to find our son.
- For six years, I'm going
to bed with heartbreak.

00:16.320 --> 00:17.365
We need to divorce and move on.

00:18.105 --> 00:19.454
- Hello?
- Dad.

00:20.846 --> 00:21.978
- Where is he?
- Oh, my God.

00:22.152 --> 00:23.110
- Is it really you?
- Mom?

00:24.807 --> 00:26.809
You are home.

02:42.162 --> 02:43.728
You're late.

02:43.902 --> 02:47.036
Okay, and half your staff
is watching cam girls.

02:47.210 --> 02:49.517
Actually, they're watching
people in rooms

02:49.691 --> 02:50.692
with the third-best-selling
smart TV on the market.

02:51.214 --> 02:52.998
Why?

02:53.173 --> 02:55.305
'Cause yours truly found
a vulnerability

02:55.479 --> 02:56.480
in the third-best-selling
smart TV on the market.

02:56.654 --> 02:58.265
An authentication bypass.

02:59.353 --> 03:01.050
A backdoor.

03:01.224 --> 03:03.052
Does this mean that you can
block The Real Housewives?

03:03.226 --> 03:04.967
Because that franchise
has gotten--

03:05.141 --> 03:09.276
It means I can access
the built-in webcam and mic.

03:09.450 --> 03:11.278
- Ah-ha.
- The amount of actionable intelligence

03:11.452 --> 03:13.454
I've gotten from that
has put me in the black...

03:13.628 --> 03:15.630
...for the whole year!

03:15.804 --> 03:18.285
So you hack smart TVs and
you're blackmailing people?

03:18.459 --> 03:20.678
I'm offering editorial control

03:20.852 --> 03:25.074
over what information
about them becomes public.

03:25.248 --> 03:27.729
And now that my finances
are squared away,

03:27.903 --> 03:30.558
I want to offer
this vulnerability
to your company.

03:30.732 --> 03:32.951
June and I don't work together
anymore, so if you want to--

03:33.125 --> 03:34.953
Yeah, yeah, you ditched
private security

03:35.127 --> 03:36.912
for the force,
Missing Persons.

03:37.086 --> 03:39.001
That's why I called you here.

03:39.175 --> 03:40.872
I caught something
really messed up

03:41.046 --> 03:42.744
that you and the ex
gotta see.

03:42.918 --> 03:44.354
Why do you know that
I'm working with Nikki?

03:44.528 --> 03:45.834
- Forget that.
- No, can't.

03:46.008 --> 03:47.314
- This is important.
- Nope.

03:47.488 --> 03:49.490
Okay, I know a lot of things.

03:49.664 --> 03:52.667
Like how June set up a meeting

03:52.841 --> 03:54.059
at a fertility clinic for you
because your soldiers

03:54.234 --> 03:56.105
- aren't saluting...
- Oh.

03:56.279 --> 03:58.281
I also know you shouldn't have
a smart TV in your bedroom.

03:58.455 --> 04:01.589
So, W... Wow. So you're
watching us in the bedroom?

04:01.763 --> 04:04.461
Of course not.
I have a staff for that.

04:04.635 --> 04:06.550
- Why am I here?
- Oh, yeah.

04:10.293 --> 04:11.816
<i>Please!</i>

04:12.991 --> 04:13.818
There it is.

04:16.473 --> 04:17.257
Who is that?

04:17.431 --> 04:19.607
No clue.

04:19.781 --> 04:21.217
The tune-up on your weed
wacker's gotta wait,

04:21.391 --> 04:23.350
because that feed... it's live.

04:27.441 --> 04:29.138
He's so beautiful.

04:29.312 --> 04:31.358
I need you to open the link
I just sent you.

04:31.532 --> 04:34.056
It's from
a confidential source,
and it's happening right now.

04:34.230 --> 04:35.840
<i>Second day on the job, and
you're already
giving me a case.</i>

04:41.890 --> 04:43.370
Have you issued an alert?

04:43.544 --> 04:45.372
Saying what? I don't know
who he is.

04:45.546 --> 04:47.504
There's no VPN, so
I don't know where he is.

04:47.678 --> 04:49.637
All I know is
he's in bad shape,
and he needs our help.

04:49.811 --> 04:51.595
Keith's been gone for
six years.

04:51.769 --> 04:53.380
How could I leave him
on his first day back?

04:54.032 --> 04:56.687
Nik...

04:56.861 --> 04:58.907
I would not pull you away
from him
if this wasn't life or death.

05:06.218 --> 05:08.046
I'm gonna...

05:08.220 --> 05:10.005
I'm gonna ask you
some questions.

05:10.179 --> 05:12.181
Please, no.

05:13.443 --> 05:14.879
First...

05:15.053 --> 05:16.881
How you respond

05:17.055 --> 05:18.187
will determine whether
you leave here alive.

05:22.539 --> 05:23.888
How about some breakfast?

05:29.590 --> 05:31.461
<i>I'll take off the gag,
and when I do, you'll eat.</i>

05:34.725 --> 05:35.900
<i>Quietly and without a word.</i>

05:39.513 --> 05:40.818
Kemi.

05:40.992 --> 05:42.951
Has our guy been
reported missing?

05:43.125 --> 05:44.909
No, nothing on the dark web,

05:45.083 --> 05:47.303
but I did learn how to say
"virgin auction" in Vietnamese, so...

05:48.870 --> 05:50.567
Speaking of virgin,
Bill Houston called.

05:50.741 --> 05:52.874
Oh, Bill Houston.
That weasel's still
on the force?

05:53.048 --> 05:55.050
The weasel is the chief
of detectives.

05:55.224 --> 05:56.878
He's the one
that needs to sign off
on your reinstatement.

05:57.052 --> 05:59.663
<i>Why are you doing this?</i>

05:59.837 --> 06:01.926
<i>I've read up on fentanyl over
these last few months.</i>

06:02.100 --> 06:03.319
How it causes...

06:04.755 --> 06:07.367
dizziness,
confusion,

06:07.541 --> 06:09.934
suffocation.

06:10.108 --> 06:12.328
<i>Please, please, look,
I don't understand.</i>

06:12.502 --> 06:14.112
<i>My son was a good kid.</i>

06:14.286 --> 06:16.637
<i>He pushed himself too hard.
He wanted to ace his finals.</i>

06:16.811 --> 06:18.116
<i>He'd heard Adderall helped with...</i>

06:18.290 --> 06:19.901
<i>with focus.</i>

06:20.075 --> 06:21.468
<i>College students were taking it
to help them study.</i>

06:23.252 --> 06:26.037
Which was
when he came to you...

06:26.211 --> 06:28.257
And you...

06:28.431 --> 06:31.434
...sold him this fentanyl
tainted garbage.

06:31.608 --> 06:33.741
There's our motive.

06:33.915 --> 06:36.134
All right, so... So she put
the pills in the burger?

06:36.308 --> 06:37.440
- Yeah, she did.
- How many?

06:37.614 --> 06:39.399
Uh, five?

06:39.573 --> 06:41.139
Five... five pills.

06:41.313 --> 06:43.054
All right, so that's five
Adderall pills

06:43.228 --> 06:46.101
laced with fentanyl.
Average cut times five...

06:46.275 --> 06:48.495
If my math is still any good
seven years
removed from vice...

06:48.669 --> 06:50.975
2.5 milligrams of fentanyl.

06:51.149 --> 06:53.717
- Is that a lethal dose?
- Not if you're a water buffalo.

06:53.891 --> 06:56.285
All right, based on
absorption rates, um,

06:56.459 --> 06:58.548
I'd say we got about an hour,
hour 15,

06:58.722 --> 07:00.724
let's call it 68 minutes
before this guy suffocates

07:00.898 --> 07:02.160
and this grieving mother
commits murder.

07:02.334 --> 07:04.119
That is 68 minutes...

07:04.293 --> 07:05.903
...and counting.

07:06.077 --> 07:07.557
We need to find a way
to ID them.

07:07.731 --> 07:08.950
The blood works like a mask.

07:09.124 --> 07:10.821
So we can't ID him unless
he wipes it off.

07:12.519 --> 07:14.042
Or we... Or we wipe it off
for him.

07:14.216 --> 07:16.218
- Can we do that?
- Yeah, I think so...

07:16.392 --> 07:18.960
If I don't wheeze to death first.

07:19.134 --> 07:21.571
The ancients knew that
termites didn't attack sandalwood,

07:21.745 --> 07:24.356
that it had certain
protections, so you may
not appreciate the scent,

07:24.531 --> 07:27.272
- but the gods do.
- I don't like it either,
for the record.

07:27.447 --> 07:28.926
Hey, I have news about Keith.
It's about his kidnapper.

07:29.100 --> 07:30.798
You need to see this.

07:30.972 --> 07:33.104
Okay. Keep your eyes
on that feed.

07:33.278 --> 07:35.106
Somewhere in that video
are facts,

07:35.280 --> 07:36.891
and that man's life
depends on us finding some.

07:37.065 --> 07:38.327
Yeah.

07:42.418 --> 07:44.768
The 911 call came at 746,

07:44.942 --> 07:46.291
so I pulled the feed.

07:51.296 --> 07:53.821
Now, Keith told the clerk that
he was being chased by someone
down the street.

07:53.995 --> 07:55.605
Why aren't we doing
a canvass right now?

07:55.779 --> 07:58.129
Well, I want to,
but I need two things.

07:58.303 --> 08:01.481
Nikki, I need authorization,
and I have to speak to Keith.

08:01.655 --> 08:03.570
All right, his kidnapper might
still be in the area

08:03.744 --> 08:06.486
- waiting to get him back.
- He deserves a normal life.

08:06.660 --> 08:09.184
That's what he deserves, okay?
To look forward, not to be
dragged back.

08:09.358 --> 08:11.055
I agree, but he can't move
forward unless we find
his kidnapper.

08:14.189 --> 08:15.407
I gotta speak to him.

08:17.366 --> 08:18.498
Fine. I'll wake him.

08:18.672 --> 08:20.543
And I will have him come in.

08:20.717 --> 08:22.632
- It's the right move.
- Yeah, for a cop.

08:24.199 --> 08:25.809
For a mom, I'm not so sure.

08:25.983 --> 08:28.638
Hey. I have something
to show you.

08:28.812 --> 08:31.249
Did I mention my affair with
Ben Franklin?

08:31.423 --> 08:32.816
Not an attractive man,
but his mind,

08:32.990 --> 08:35.297
oh, my God,
his mind made up for it.

08:35.471 --> 08:38.169
Until the gout flared up,
I could handle
his wooden teeth,

08:38.343 --> 08:40.128
his refusal to bathe,
but the swelling, oh, my God,

08:40.302 --> 08:41.782
you can't imagine the swelling.

08:41.956 --> 08:45.307
Ben invented reading glasses.

08:45.481 --> 08:47.265
These...

08:47.439 --> 08:50.007
...belong to our suspect,
and this...

08:50.181 --> 08:52.401
...is the refraction
caused by her prescription,

08:52.575 --> 08:55.622
so I sent it to an optical
physicist at Drexel,

08:55.796 --> 08:57.014
who was able to decipher
her prescription.

08:57.188 --> 08:58.494
- How many people have 'em?
- Thousands.

08:58.668 --> 09:00.844
But in Desire Frames

09:01.018 --> 09:03.586
sold at Four Eyes
Online Optical?

09:03.760 --> 09:05.936
That is a party of one.
Molly Gallagher, 39,

09:06.110 --> 09:07.851
works at Millennium Properties,

09:08.025 --> 09:09.766
lives at 47 Wyndale.

09:09.940 --> 09:11.551
Have a TAC team meet us
at the location.

09:11.725 --> 09:13.117
- Let's get our baby back.
- Gotcha.

09:19.776 --> 09:21.082
The physical effects
of a Fentanyl overdose

09:21.256 --> 09:22.257
are nearly immediate.

09:22.431 --> 09:23.127
Police!

09:24.520 --> 09:25.608
Show yourself!

09:25.782 --> 09:26.566
Clear!

09:29.351 --> 09:30.308
Clammy skin...

09:30.482 --> 09:31.614
Living room's clear.

09:31.788 --> 09:33.573
Sweep upstairs.

09:33.747 --> 09:34.878
...gasping...

09:36.750 --> 09:38.012
Basement clear!

09:38.186 --> 09:39.187
...blue lips...

09:40.667 --> 09:41.624
Bedroom's clear!

09:43.234 --> 09:44.409
Upstairs, clear!

09:45.846 --> 09:47.238
Please, I'm begging you.

09:47.412 --> 09:48.718
Please, please...

09:51.068 --> 09:52.766
We cleared the whole house,
he's definitely not here.

09:55.333 --> 09:56.726
What the hell is all this?

09:59.816 --> 10:01.165
It's in your power
to end this.

10:06.083 --> 10:07.258
All I need is a name.

10:11.698 --> 10:13.177
His name was Asher.

10:13.351 --> 10:15.353
He died of a drug overdose
six months ago.

10:15.527 --> 10:17.617
His mom has been investigating
it ever since.

10:17.791 --> 10:19.793
Look at this,
very thorough.

10:19.967 --> 10:22.970
Like, instructions that Asher
used for the drug buy.

10:23.144 --> 10:25.537
His emails. A ridiculous
amount of emails

10:25.712 --> 10:28.105
between her and the department
basically begging them
to act.

10:28.279 --> 10:30.499
Hey. What do you know?

10:30.673 --> 10:34.503
She has a Karlskrona rug.

10:34.677 --> 10:36.766
- <i>Which means what?</i>
- That she has dismal taste.

10:36.940 --> 10:38.681
It's cheap, synthetic,
and mass-produced.

10:38.855 --> 10:41.249
<i>But it also happens to be seven
by ten,</i>

10:41.423 --> 10:42.946
<i>which gives me a point
of reference</i>

10:43.120 --> 10:45.035
<i>to measure the dimensions
of the room she's in.</i>

10:45.209 --> 10:47.734
Also, the angle of the light
coming in through the windows

10:47.908 --> 10:50.432
indicates she's in a basement
on a south-east corner.

10:50.606 --> 10:52.434
Reach out to
the planning department

10:52.608 --> 10:54.044
for a list of buildings
matching that description.

10:54.218 --> 10:55.611
<i>And to the real estate company
that she worked for.</i>

10:55.785 --> 10:58.005
Okay.

10:58.179 --> 11:00.747
<i>Look at the size
of your pupil.</i>

11:00.921 --> 11:02.836
Enjoy the euphoric high
while it lasts.

11:03.010 --> 11:04.707
The next phase...

11:06.840 --> 11:07.754
...not as fun.

11:12.846 --> 11:15.587
Oh, excuse me. Could you--
I'm looking for C.

11:15.762 --> 11:17.024
I was told he'd be
in the basement.

11:18.982 --> 11:21.811
I told you on the phone,
you can't do this.

11:21.985 --> 11:24.422
And I told you, I have
to fly home. It's an emergency.

11:24.596 --> 11:26.207
No, an emergency is trying
to ID a man

11:26.381 --> 11:29.819
who's being tortured now.
Like, right now.

11:29.993 --> 11:32.387
Chuck's surgery, can't it wait,
just even one day?

11:32.561 --> 11:33.910
You're a compassionless jerk.

11:34.084 --> 11:35.999
Okay, it's... a dog.

11:36.173 --> 11:37.871
He's my childhood dog.

11:38.045 --> 11:40.221
Okay, look, um, the agency,
can they send anybody else out?

11:40.395 --> 11:41.744
They're slammed right now.

11:41.918 --> 11:44.442
I will pay you overtime.
Please. Please?

11:44.616 --> 11:47.445
- I'm sorry, C.
- Please, do not do this.

11:47.619 --> 11:50.710
Oh, my God. I-I'll pay for
Chuck's surgery.

11:50.884 --> 11:52.276
Please, just let me, I'll--

11:52.450 --> 11:53.582
Oh my gosh.

11:58.500 --> 11:59.370
Hey, Dad.

12:03.723 --> 12:05.681
Mom said you were in charge
of looking for me.

12:05.855 --> 12:06.856
And you never gave up.

12:08.728 --> 12:09.554
Thank you.

12:12.209 --> 12:13.167
Grape soda?

12:14.081 --> 12:14.864
What?

12:16.997 --> 12:17.911
It's your favorite, right?

12:22.916 --> 12:24.831
<i>You know, I know we just met, but...</i>

12:25.005 --> 12:26.093
<i>...I feel like I've known
you forever.</i>

12:27.747 --> 12:28.312
<i>Take a seat.</i>

12:31.881 --> 12:34.841
<i>I wanted to talk to you because...</i>

12:35.015 --> 12:36.843
<i>your kidnapper, he might still
be in the area.</i>

12:37.017 --> 12:38.540
You know, we searched where
we found you,

12:38.714 --> 12:40.020
but our best chance
of catching him

12:40.194 --> 12:41.891
- is with your help.
- It's sweeter than I remember.

12:42.065 --> 12:45.155
<i>That's a good place
to start. What do you remember?</i>

12:45.329 --> 12:46.853
<i>The night you were taken.
Tell me about it.</i>

12:49.290 --> 12:50.117
<i>I was asleep.</i>

12:50.987 --> 12:52.206
A noise woke me.

12:53.860 --> 12:55.165
Something outside my window,
so I opened it.

12:56.732 --> 12:58.560
It was cold, that's what
I remember.

12:58.734 --> 12:59.648
How cold it was.

12:59.822 --> 13:01.084
Yeah.

13:01.258 --> 13:02.607
Can you...

13:02.782 --> 13:04.131
...remember a name?

13:04.305 --> 13:05.045
Can you describe him
to me?

13:05.219 --> 13:06.655
My sister hates me.

13:06.829 --> 13:07.743
My parents are divorced.

13:10.485 --> 13:11.573
Not a lot of things are...

13:11.747 --> 13:12.704
...sweeter than I remember.

13:14.706 --> 13:16.404
<i>Keith, the person
who took you--</i>

13:16.578 --> 13:18.362
<i>May I sit somewhere else?</i>

13:18.536 --> 13:20.364
<i>Yeah, yeah.
Sit wherever you like.</i>

13:25.630 --> 13:27.284
You know what?

13:27.458 --> 13:28.851
You know what? Let's forget
about that night.

13:30.070 --> 13:31.506
Let's talk about yesterday.

13:31.680 --> 13:33.900
In the convenience store,

13:34.074 --> 13:35.379
you told the clerk that
you were being chased.

13:36.990 --> 13:39.557
That's hard.

13:39.731 --> 13:41.385
Well, on the tape,
you said they were
right outside.

13:43.518 --> 13:44.649
I can't...

13:44.824 --> 13:46.042
Hey.

13:46.216 --> 13:47.217
Hey, all we need
is a name.

13:48.828 --> 13:50.090
I can't.

13:50.264 --> 13:51.700
Keith, one name
and we're done, I swear.

13:51.874 --> 13:54.181
I can't! Stop asking me!

13:54.355 --> 13:55.573
- Everything's okay, calm--
- That's it, that's it!
It's over.

13:55.747 --> 13:57.488
- Nik...
- Mike. It's over.

14:00.752 --> 14:03.190
Hey, baby. Hey, no, it's okay.

14:04.582 --> 14:06.584
It's all right, baby.

14:06.758 --> 14:07.847
It's all right,
I'm right here, okay?

14:09.413 --> 14:10.414
Everything's all right.

14:24.298 --> 14:26.343
Not sure is not an answer.

14:26.517 --> 14:28.650
I asked you to identify
an abandoned building

14:28.824 --> 14:30.608
in which a man
is being tortured.

14:30.782 --> 14:32.219
You're the planning department.

14:32.393 --> 14:34.656
You issue permits for every
building built in this burg.

14:34.830 --> 14:37.659
You base those permits on, oh,
I don't know,

14:37.833 --> 14:39.922
the measurements of the rooms,
the materials used,

14:40.096 --> 14:41.706
the lot angle.
What have I given you?

14:41.881 --> 14:43.665
The measurements of the room,
the materials used,

14:43.839 --> 14:44.840
the lot angle.

14:45.014 --> 14:47.147
You have 38 minutes,

14:47.321 --> 14:49.149
maybe, until the man
I'm looking at

14:49.323 --> 14:51.542
draws his last breath,
which if he knew what I knew,

14:51.716 --> 14:53.631
he would devote entirely
to cursing you.

14:53.805 --> 14:55.938
Now, take that "not sure,"

14:56.112 --> 14:57.766
shove it up the planet Uranus,

14:57.940 --> 14:59.420
get sure, and call me back.

14:59.594 --> 15:00.900
Someone's in a bitchy mood.

15:01.074 --> 15:02.727
Ah, situationally bitchy.

15:02.902 --> 15:05.382
A means to an end,
like sex or high school.

15:05.556 --> 15:06.949
You're a terrible influence
on me.

15:08.951 --> 15:09.996
Look at me.

15:10.866 --> 15:12.172
Your eyes.

15:12.346 --> 15:13.347
There's a darkness.

15:13.521 --> 15:14.870
Yeah.

15:15.044 --> 15:15.958
He's sitting
right there.

15:16.916 --> 15:17.917
Who, Keith?

15:19.396 --> 15:20.615
Nikki...
No!

15:20.789 --> 15:23.487
Come on.
I said no!

15:23.661 --> 15:25.185
We need answers.
Not from Keith.

15:25.359 --> 15:27.752
Well, he's the only one
who has them!

15:27.927 --> 15:29.667
This isn't just about Keith.
All right, his kidnapper
is still out there.

15:29.841 --> 15:31.104
There might be
other victims.

15:31.278 --> 15:33.106
Okay, if there are others,
my heart breaks for them,

15:33.280 --> 15:35.630
but I will not hurt my son
to help them, no!

15:35.804 --> 15:38.241
I will not dig through his pain
and suffering

15:38.415 --> 15:39.808
to find the answers we need.
We have to find another way.

15:40.983 --> 15:43.029
Hey, baby. Hey.

15:44.769 --> 15:46.206
Thank you for taking him home.

15:46.380 --> 15:47.859
Oh, did I have a choice?

15:48.034 --> 15:49.252
You called the dean
to get me out of class.

15:49.426 --> 15:51.472
Okay, okay.
Come here, come here.

15:51.646 --> 15:53.300
He's had a rough morning, okay?

15:53.474 --> 15:54.866
He just wants
to be with family.

15:55.041 --> 15:56.564
I'll take him home.
Not gonna babysit.

15:56.738 --> 15:57.478
I have a chem test
third period.

15:57.652 --> 15:58.914
Okay.

16:00.350 --> 16:01.961
Let's go, scrote.

16:02.135 --> 16:03.527
So the planning department
was a bust,

16:03.701 --> 16:05.573
but C figured it out.

16:05.747 --> 16:08.924
If he offered rail services,
I would ride that train.

16:09.098 --> 16:12.362
We need to talk about the way
she's dealing with this.
Or not dealing.

16:12.536 --> 16:15.017
She's 17, maybe she's supposed
to be this self-absorbed,
I don't know.

16:15.191 --> 16:18.847
Her missing brother just came
home. No one is that awful.

16:19.021 --> 16:22.111
Okay, no one is
that self-absorbed, so no.

16:22.285 --> 16:23.808
There must be something
that we're missing.

16:25.158 --> 16:26.507
Hey, June.

16:26.681 --> 16:27.638
You cancelled the appointment?

16:27.812 --> 16:29.814
Yeah, um...

16:29.989 --> 16:31.120
...because of the case.

16:31.294 --> 16:32.339
The video that Renwick
showed us--

16:32.513 --> 16:34.471
If you don't want to do this, then...

16:34.645 --> 16:37.170
That? I don't want to do this
in front of three people
pretending not to listen.

16:37.344 --> 16:39.259
- That, I don't want to do.
- You guys can talk in
my office.

16:39.433 --> 16:41.304
No, there's nothing to talk
about. He's embarrassed.

16:41.478 --> 16:43.611
I'm not embarrassed.
Your motility's low, so what?

16:43.785 --> 16:44.699
- Aw...
- I did not cancel
the appointment

16:44.873 --> 16:46.353
because I'm embarrassed.

16:46.527 --> 16:48.007
Okay. So why'd you cancel it?

16:50.270 --> 16:52.098
I mean, that's...
It's a question.

16:52.272 --> 16:53.969
My god! Just be honest
with her!

16:55.492 --> 16:58.104
Be honest about what? What...

16:58.278 --> 16:59.888
Oh, you two are getting
back together, aren't you?

17:00.062 --> 17:01.672
- Whoa!
- No!

17:01.846 --> 17:04.066
Of course. I'm such an idiot.

17:04.240 --> 17:05.372
No, Keith's back,
you're working together.

17:06.808 --> 17:08.940
Shut up, please!

17:09.115 --> 17:11.639
Do you really want
to have this conversation
right now in front of...

17:11.813 --> 17:13.858
You want to know?
Okay, I'm not infertile, June.
I'm not infertile.

17:14.033 --> 17:16.165
- That's unexpected.
- I was concerned,
I was worried,

17:16.339 --> 17:18.559
I wasn't ready because
of Keith being missing still,

17:18.733 --> 17:19.821
so I took measures.

17:19.995 --> 17:21.301
Measures?

17:21.475 --> 17:23.303
Yeah, to like,
reduce the odds.

17:23.477 --> 17:25.348
What type of measures?

17:25.522 --> 17:27.046
What type of measures?

17:27.220 --> 17:29.439
- Yeah, what type?
- What type?

17:29.613 --> 17:31.311
Oh, really? You're... That's
what you're doing right now?

17:31.485 --> 17:32.921
Okay? I took a hot bath.

17:33.095 --> 17:34.444
I took a hot bath.

17:34.618 --> 17:36.403
I left the theatre
before the credits ran.

17:36.577 --> 17:39.884
- What! Is this happening?
Is this happening?
- Shut up. Okay?

17:40.059 --> 17:41.756
I'm sorry, I was there
when the credits ran,
and the credits ran.

17:41.930 --> 17:43.497
You were there for the credits.

17:46.021 --> 17:48.284
I gotta go, okay? I'm sorry.

17:48.458 --> 17:51.809
I-I should've been more honest
with you, okay?

17:51.983 --> 17:52.810
But things are different
now, right?

17:52.984 --> 17:54.203
You need professional help.

17:55.204 --> 17:56.379
I'm sorry.

17:58.468 --> 18:00.383
That was so fun, guys,
thank you.

18:00.557 --> 18:02.429
You should buy her one
of those edible bouquets,

18:02.603 --> 18:03.995
you heard of 'em?
Work like a charm.

18:04.170 --> 18:05.214
- Yeah.
- Thanks...

18:11.742 --> 18:14.963
Hi, baby. Hey. How are you?

18:15.137 --> 18:18.097
Hey, sorry. I can explain
that. Him.

18:18.271 --> 18:21.230
His caregiver, Emma,
stopped caring.

18:21.404 --> 18:23.145
Aw, you know your dad
is always welcome here.

18:23.319 --> 18:26.017
Uh, Kemi said you had an ID?

18:26.192 --> 18:30.413
Yes, I do.
Uh, he is Hugo Mendez.

18:30.587 --> 18:32.328
Well, how do you know
that's the guy?

18:32.502 --> 18:34.765
Over the pandemic,
I worked out an algorithm

18:34.939 --> 18:38.639
using depth
by spatial convolutions
to ID people in masks,

18:38.813 --> 18:40.597
so using what's visible here...

18:40.771 --> 18:43.078
in this case, it is the ears,

18:43.252 --> 18:47.474
eyebrow, the cheek, chin, um...

18:47.648 --> 18:49.302
Please can you not do that?

18:49.476 --> 18:51.869
Issue an alert for Molly
Gallagher and Hugo Mendez,

18:52.043 --> 18:53.654
and be clear on it.
We're almost out of time.

18:53.828 --> 18:56.439
For the love of Zuul,
please can you just stop?

18:56.613 --> 18:58.963
- Okay, we should go.
- Yep.

18:59.138 --> 19:01.009
I'm sorry, I...

19:01.183 --> 19:03.011
Ugh...
Hey, it's okay.

19:03.185 --> 19:05.622
I'm the one who should apologize.

19:05.796 --> 19:07.972
It's not that, or you. Sorry.

19:08.147 --> 19:09.452
It's okay.

19:09.626 --> 19:12.325
It's him, you know? I...

19:12.499 --> 19:14.501
I spend all day looking
for missing people,

19:14.675 --> 19:16.981
and the one person
I really want to find is gone,

19:17.156 --> 19:18.940
and I just...

19:19.114 --> 19:19.723
There's just no getting
him back.

19:37.263 --> 19:39.178
Mr. Mendez, it's okay,

19:39.352 --> 19:40.483
you're not in trouble.

19:43.138 --> 19:44.748
But your brother is.

19:46.315 --> 19:48.056
Molly Gallagher, the woman
in the alert.

19:49.405 --> 19:50.754
Tell us about her.

19:54.018 --> 19:55.585
The drugs, then,
the fentanyl he deals.

19:55.759 --> 19:57.283
Can you tell us
about that?

20:02.810 --> 20:04.725
We will find your brother,

20:04.899 --> 20:06.509
but we can't do that
without your help.

20:06.683 --> 20:09.599
He's my baby brother.

20:09.773 --> 20:10.992
Look, I know that
this is hard.

20:12.907 --> 20:14.735
We really don't have
a lot of time.

20:14.909 --> 20:16.084
Do you know where
your brother was last night?

20:19.696 --> 20:21.785
I'm sorry
about your son,

20:21.959 --> 20:22.873
but I had nothing
to do with--

20:23.047 --> 20:24.571
Do not lie to me.

20:24.745 --> 20:26.747
I never sold drugs

20:26.921 --> 20:28.923
to anyone. I promise.

20:29.097 --> 20:31.795
Your promises mean
nothing to me.

20:34.102 --> 20:36.235
You have robbed

20:36.409 --> 20:39.194
this world of a precious boy...

20:39.368 --> 20:41.196
...and I promise you,

20:41.370 --> 20:43.807
you will never do it again.

20:55.471 --> 20:56.646
Low on mayo!

20:56.820 --> 20:59.649
Um, we need to speak
to your manager.

20:59.823 --> 21:01.216
Uh, Aliyah,
people here to see you.

21:01.390 --> 21:04.393
- How can I help you?
- Detective Nikki Batista.

21:04.567 --> 21:06.526
We're investigating
the abduction of one of
your employees,

21:06.700 --> 21:08.136
Hugo Mendez.

21:08.310 --> 21:10.921
Hugo was abducted?
Oh, my God. When?

21:11.095 --> 21:13.141
According to his brother,
he worked a shift here
last night.

21:13.315 --> 21:15.448
Yeah, he's
our drive-thru cashier.

21:15.622 --> 21:17.624
Hi, Aliyah, I have a question.
What if I order a number 15?

21:17.798 --> 21:19.974
Our combo meals
only go up to 14.

21:20.148 --> 21:22.281
Sorry, um, Asher's
instructions were drive up,

21:22.455 --> 21:24.631
say 15, pay, take off.

21:24.805 --> 21:28.025
Aliyah, we have reason
to believe there are drugs
being sold on the premises.

21:28.199 --> 21:30.245
Normally,
we get a search warrant.
We don't have time for that.

21:30.419 --> 21:32.682
Time that Hugo doesn't have.

21:32.856 --> 21:34.684
But with your consent,
we can skip all that.

21:34.858 --> 21:35.990
You think we can take
a look around?

21:36.164 --> 21:37.731
Of course.

21:51.919 --> 21:53.486
Hey!

22:01.015 --> 22:02.843
Hey, sorry, man.

22:03.017 --> 22:04.932
We need to talk about
your combo meals.

22:11.547 --> 22:13.419
No...

22:13.593 --> 22:15.943
No, no, no.
Don't die, don't die on me yet.

22:16.117 --> 22:18.119
<i>Before you tell me
what I need to know.</i>

22:18.293 --> 22:19.555
Room service.

22:19.729 --> 22:21.427
This is all your fault.

22:21.601 --> 22:24.604
What happened to our son.
What she's doing to him.

22:24.778 --> 22:26.388
I got nothing to do with that.

22:29.260 --> 22:31.959
<i>I can't tell you
what I don't know.</i>

22:32.133 --> 22:33.352
<i>I told you
not to lie to me.</i>

22:33.526 --> 22:35.136
But he's not lying, is he?

22:36.355 --> 22:38.357
Hugo, Hugo is a good kid.

22:38.531 --> 22:40.359
College.

22:40.533 --> 22:42.143
Night shift to help pay for it.

22:42.317 --> 22:44.232
Has a brother who says
he doesn't drink or do drugs.

22:45.102 --> 22:46.843
If you say so.

22:47.017 --> 22:48.758
<i>Don't lie to me.</i>

22:48.932 --> 22:52.066
<i>I'll just say whatever
you want me to say.</i>

22:52.240 --> 22:53.589
<i>You know what
I want you to say!</i>

22:53.763 --> 22:55.939
<i>I want the name
of the supplier!</i>

22:56.113 --> 22:58.507
<i>I need help.</i>

22:58.681 --> 23:00.944
<i>You can help yourself,
just tell me!</i>

23:01.118 --> 23:03.991
Our dog, a couple years ago,
got ringworm,

23:04.165 --> 23:05.862
which is disgusting.
It's like a fungus

23:06.036 --> 23:07.211
and humans can get it.

23:07.386 --> 23:09.388
Anyway, the vet gave us pills,

23:09.562 --> 23:12.391
but Edwina did not
like to take pills.

23:12.565 --> 23:15.089
So we would put the pills
in her water bowl.

23:15.263 --> 23:17.221
Sort of like how I just

23:17.396 --> 23:20.224
dissolved these fentanyl pills
into your water bowl.

23:20.399 --> 23:22.575
Naloxone.
Naloxone can't help Hugo

23:22.749 --> 23:24.838
because Hugo cannot confess
to something he didn't do.

23:26.230 --> 23:27.406
Something that you did. Now...

23:29.582 --> 23:32.236
...you admit it
and it can help you.

23:35.588 --> 23:36.937
We got a hit off the alert.

23:37.111 --> 23:39.679
Doorbell cam caught
the abduction.

23:39.853 --> 23:41.202
Uh, did we get a timestamp?
Yeah, why?

23:42.856 --> 23:44.074
Your hands smell
like sandalwood.

23:44.248 --> 23:46.207
Okay, there's a dark force
out there.

23:46.381 --> 23:48.165
Fighting it is a constant
soul-sucking battle

23:48.339 --> 23:49.950
that I've been fighting
since I went mute for a year

23:50.124 --> 23:52.169
when I was 15.
So you know, you're welcome.

23:52.343 --> 23:54.476
- Okay.
- Okay.

23:54.650 --> 23:56.522
Now, tell me
about the timestamp
and why it matters.

23:56.696 --> 23:58.524
Millennium Properties
has 32 vacant listings

23:58.698 --> 24:00.439
that match the specs
of our room,

24:00.613 --> 24:02.353
so I think if we know
where and when

24:02.528 --> 24:04.225
- the abduction took place...
- I can calculate which unit

24:04.399 --> 24:05.661
they might be in. Yes!

24:05.835 --> 24:06.749
Yes. There it is.

24:18.979 --> 24:21.024
Your father has a kind spirit.

24:24.680 --> 24:26.029
I wish I could say
the same about mine.

24:33.907 --> 24:35.430
Sandalwood.

24:40.696 --> 24:42.263
What did you say?

24:42.437 --> 24:43.873
Sandalwood.

24:45.440 --> 24:47.355
Reminds me of your mother.

24:49.575 --> 24:53.535
She used to wear this fancy
French perfume...

24:53.709 --> 24:55.102
...that smelled like that.

24:57.191 --> 24:59.541
Same scent for 40 years.

25:01.804 --> 25:03.284
I miss it.

25:07.636 --> 25:10.857
I'm sorry if I interrupted
your work today.

25:13.207 --> 25:15.949
No, Dad, no, don't be silly.

25:17.167 --> 25:19.169
No, I am...

25:19.343 --> 25:21.084
I am really glad you're here.

25:22.956 --> 25:27.395
Hey. The hospital sent
over Keith's test results.

25:27.569 --> 25:29.658
The initial X-rays they did
of his injuries
revealed some...

25:29.832 --> 25:30.703
...older wounds.

25:32.487 --> 25:33.662
I got a location!

25:35.229 --> 25:37.797
Okay, the call off of the alert

25:37.971 --> 25:40.495
gave us where the abduction
took place.

25:40.669 --> 25:44.151
Timestamp has that
occurring at 516 a.m.

25:44.325 --> 25:47.154
The first image
in our live feed

25:47.328 --> 25:50.287
shows a bloody Hugo
in that chair at 602.

25:50.461 --> 25:54.161
At an average speed
of 40 miles an hour,

25:54.335 --> 25:56.119
that's a four-mile radius.

25:56.293 --> 25:58.948
Within that radius,
Millennium has one listing,

25:59.122 --> 26:00.689
5230 Englewood Avenue.

26:00.863 --> 26:02.822
And yes...

26:02.996 --> 26:05.781
I checked,
it's 11 minutes away.

26:05.955 --> 26:08.001
I'll notify SWAT.
Hey, Mike, get the EMTs going.

26:08.175 --> 26:09.698
Jay, you're with me.

26:09.872 --> 26:10.743
Hey, you know
what I'm thinking?

26:12.875 --> 26:15.269
Yeah. And you can't think it.

26:15.443 --> 26:18.489
No, I can. See, if we find
the person who took our kid,

26:18.664 --> 26:20.143
I'd do the exact same thing
that she's doing.

26:20.317 --> 26:21.144
Let's go.

26:23.103 --> 26:24.626
Come on,
Hugo's almost out of time.

26:36.246 --> 26:37.378
Thinking is fine, you know?

26:37.552 --> 26:39.728
I think too.
You just can't do it.

26:39.902 --> 26:41.904
- You saw the X-rays, right?
- It doesn't matter!

26:42.078 --> 26:43.645
I mean, you saw
what he did to Keith?

26:43.819 --> 26:45.516
You need to think like a cop,
not a dad.

26:45.691 --> 26:48.737
Okay, arrest, trial, conviction,

26:48.911 --> 26:51.261
he gets sentenced to 20 years,
gets out in 10,

26:51.435 --> 26:52.393
to do it again, to destroy
somebody else's life.

26:52.567 --> 26:53.873
You don't know that.

26:54.047 --> 26:55.614
I know he destroyed Keith's.

26:55.788 --> 26:58.355
- Take that back.
- It's true, Nik.

26:58.529 --> 27:00.967
- Take it back.
- What do you think, Nik?

27:01.141 --> 27:03.056
You think you can
watch him sleep

27:03.230 --> 27:05.232
and he'll be your baby again?
You think
he can heal like that?

27:05.406 --> 27:07.930
He can heal if we let him.
If we help him heal...

27:08.104 --> 27:10.106
No, he'll heal if we do
what we're supposed to do.

27:10.280 --> 27:11.891
Doing anything
for the people we love

27:12.065 --> 27:14.371
means doing nothing
to hurt them.

27:14.545 --> 27:16.286
Hurting who?
I'm going after his kidnapper.

27:16.460 --> 27:17.418
You're going after
his kidnapper

27:17.592 --> 27:18.985
because you're looking
to hurt him.

27:19.159 --> 27:20.943
Yes! I am! A hundred percent.
You're not?

27:21.117 --> 27:23.163
No. I am looking
to help Keith.

27:23.337 --> 27:24.904
Which means not taking
the law into my own hands,

27:25.078 --> 27:26.688
no matter how much I want to.

27:33.347 --> 27:35.392
The person who took Keith
did not destroy him,

27:35.566 --> 27:37.873
but you, you going to prison
for killing that man,

27:38.047 --> 27:39.788
maybe he will never
recover from that.

27:46.316 --> 27:48.623
I need you to promise me.

27:48.797 --> 27:50.669
We don't have time for this.

27:50.843 --> 27:53.802
- Promise me, Jay.
- I can't.

27:53.976 --> 27:55.412
You know, the reason
Bill Houston called

27:55.586 --> 27:57.501
was because he rejected
your reinstatement.

27:57.676 --> 27:59.329
He doesn't want you back
in the Philly PD.

27:59.503 --> 28:01.418
And I went to the mat
for you to change his mind.

28:01.592 --> 28:02.855
Don't make me regret it.

28:15.737 --> 28:17.260
What do you see?

28:18.131 --> 28:19.262
She looks spent.

28:20.394 --> 28:21.830
Capable of anything.

28:23.005 --> 28:25.442
Here we go.

28:25.616 --> 28:28.271
I think you're on time.
But I'm not sure.

28:34.495 --> 28:35.714
Okay.

28:37.106 --> 28:38.934
No! No, no, no, no, no!

28:39.108 --> 28:41.720
- You don't wanna do that.
- He killed my son.

28:41.894 --> 28:44.374
- No, Molly, no he didn't.
- He gave him fentanyl.

28:44.548 --> 28:46.637
I know that because
he gave it to me too.

28:46.812 --> 28:48.030
<i>Welcome to Burgerpotamus,
how can I help you?</i>

28:48.204 --> 28:49.771
I'd like the number
15, please.

28:49.945 --> 28:50.685
Okay, first window, please.

28:54.645 --> 28:55.603
Here's your chicken.

28:59.389 --> 29:01.348
No, he handed you a bag.

29:01.522 --> 29:04.003
He did not know what was in it.

29:04.177 --> 29:05.395
We've arrested the man
who did, okay?

29:05.569 --> 29:07.223
The man responsible
for what happened to Asher

29:07.397 --> 29:09.138
is already in custody.

29:09.312 --> 29:11.662
- And he confessed.
- I don't believe you.

29:11.837 --> 29:13.099
Molly, I want to show
you something.

29:13.273 --> 29:15.144
<i>I used
the drive-thru.</i>

29:15.318 --> 29:18.495
<i>Yeah, when I was taking orders,
I'd line up the buyers,</i>

29:18.669 --> 29:20.019
<i>they'd pay me through an app,</i>

29:20.193 --> 29:22.456
<i>and Hugo just handed
them the bags.</i>

29:22.630 --> 29:25.328
<i>So Hugo had no idea
what was inside
the drive-thru orders?</i>

29:26.634 --> 29:27.809
<i>No.</i>

29:27.983 --> 29:29.985
See?

29:30.159 --> 29:31.726
That's why I need you to let
my partner here

29:31.900 --> 29:33.597
give Hugo the antidote, okay?

29:33.772 --> 29:35.817
That man did nothing!

29:35.991 --> 29:37.906
Killing him will do nothing.

29:38.080 --> 29:39.995
I have nothing to lose.

29:40.169 --> 29:41.605
Okay, okay, hey. Molly, listen.

29:41.780 --> 29:43.651
I know you don't, okay?

29:43.825 --> 29:46.523
You lost your son, okay,
and with that,
you lost everything.

29:46.697 --> 29:49.178
Except, you want revenge,
right? You want justice?

29:49.352 --> 29:50.571
To make sense
of a senseless world.

29:50.745 --> 29:52.094
- Stop it!
- Molly.

29:52.268 --> 29:55.010
Stop moving, stop talking,
just stop.

29:55.184 --> 29:56.751
Molly, Molly, guns away.

29:56.925 --> 29:59.058
Look at me, I'm a cop.
All right? I'm a cop.

29:59.232 --> 30:00.799
I swore an oath.

30:00.973 --> 30:02.844
An oath to uphold the law.

30:03.018 --> 30:04.933
If this was the man
who killed your son,

30:05.107 --> 30:07.414
if he was responsible for what
happened to you and him,

30:07.588 --> 30:09.677
I would answer
to a different oath.

30:09.851 --> 30:12.201
- A higher oath.
- Molly, drop the gun.

30:12.375 --> 30:15.117
I wouldn't take another step.
But he's innocent,
so I have to.

30:15.291 --> 30:17.337
I have to take that step,
I'm gonna take that step

30:17.511 --> 30:18.773
and I'm gonna give Hugo
the antidote.

30:18.947 --> 30:20.862
Baby, I'm gonna count
to three, okay?

30:21.036 --> 30:22.342
I'm gonna take one more step.

30:22.516 --> 30:24.692
- One...
- You can shoot me

30:24.866 --> 30:26.912
and go to prison
for murdering two people,

30:27.086 --> 30:28.522
- or you can let me do...
- Two...

30:28.696 --> 30:30.393
...what I gotta do

30:30.567 --> 30:31.655
and no one gets punished,
except the person

30:31.830 --> 30:33.266
who killed your son. Okay?

30:40.273 --> 30:41.404
Go, go, go!

30:42.057 --> 30:43.406
Get down.

30:49.456 --> 30:51.240
EMTs right now! Go on!

30:54.113 --> 30:55.592
He's alive.

30:55.766 --> 30:57.638
For her sake,
I hope it stays that way.

30:59.379 --> 31:00.728
Hey, it's over.

31:00.902 --> 31:03.165
Good. Now, get back
to the office.

31:03.339 --> 31:04.863
Because the person
who kidnapped Keith...

31:05.037 --> 31:06.429
<i>I have a lead.</i>

31:07.300 --> 31:08.475
There isn't one.

31:10.216 --> 31:11.434
A higher oath.

31:12.261 --> 31:13.045
For me there is.

31:14.611 --> 31:15.786
Come on, buddy.

31:20.966 --> 31:22.576
While we waited
for PPD's canvass,

31:22.750 --> 31:24.012
I reviewed the evidence.

31:24.186 --> 31:26.406
Including other angles
we have on our video.

31:26.580 --> 31:27.450
Check this out.

31:32.847 --> 31:35.415
Almost one minute
after Keith enters,

31:35.589 --> 31:37.286
a vehicle pulls up
in front of the store.

31:37.460 --> 31:39.201
Now, Keith said
somebody was after him,

31:39.375 --> 31:40.986
that they were down the street.

31:41.160 --> 31:42.509
I think they followed him.

31:42.683 --> 31:44.380
You know, that timing
is interesting, but...

31:44.554 --> 31:46.165
...how do we know
it wasn't a random car?

31:46.339 --> 31:47.862
Because it idles
in the parking lot

31:48.036 --> 31:49.472
the entire time
Keith was inside.

31:49.646 --> 31:51.083
And as soon as the local PD
arrives on the scene,

31:51.257 --> 31:52.649
they took off.

31:52.823 --> 31:54.129
Any identifying details?

31:54.303 --> 31:55.957
A grey sedan, late model.

31:56.131 --> 31:57.654
I don't know,
the video is not clear,

31:57.828 --> 31:59.221
but I got a BOLO out.

31:59.395 --> 32:00.788
A BOLO, huh...
I got an idea.

32:00.962 --> 32:01.920
Can I... Can I use your phone?

32:02.094 --> 32:03.399
Yep, go for it.

32:03.573 --> 32:04.618
Thank you.

32:09.536 --> 32:11.059
This is June.

32:11.233 --> 32:12.974
<i>It's me. Don't hang up.</i>

32:13.148 --> 32:15.063
If I had known,
I wouldn't have answered.

32:15.237 --> 32:16.760
Which is why you didn't
call me on your cell.

32:16.935 --> 32:18.197
Worm.

32:18.371 --> 32:20.677
Um, I need...

32:20.851 --> 32:22.636
I need access to Wavehook.

32:22.810 --> 32:24.681
For the briefest of moments,

32:24.855 --> 32:26.683
I thought you were
calling to apologize.

32:26.857 --> 32:28.772
I am gonna apologize.
And I was gonna do that.

32:28.947 --> 32:30.949
I just, right now, I got a lead
and it's about Keith

32:31.123 --> 32:34.735
and that's why I need
the passcode to Wavehook.

32:34.909 --> 32:36.476
Seriously, just shove it.

32:36.650 --> 32:39.261
Okay. I deserve that. Okay?

32:39.435 --> 32:42.786
No, that's the password,
"seriouslyjustshoveit".

32:42.961 --> 32:44.353
No space, no caps.

32:44.527 --> 32:46.268
I really appreciate it.
Uh, June, can I...

32:46.442 --> 32:48.314
Can I call you back later?

32:48.488 --> 32:49.968
Hello, June? Great.

32:51.621 --> 32:53.580
I guess you didn't
send her the bouquet?

32:53.754 --> 32:56.365
No, I didn't.
Give me one second.

32:56.539 --> 32:59.629
All right, Blackwell
has a proprietary database

32:59.803 --> 33:02.632
called Wavehook. It includes
all the combined datasets

33:02.806 --> 33:04.547
of all the major
data-mining companies.

33:04.721 --> 33:08.725
The primary data
it mines is...

33:08.899 --> 33:11.032
...location.

33:11.206 --> 33:13.382
Right? So, when you go
to the naughty massage parlour,

33:13.556 --> 33:14.905
your cellphone knows
you were there

33:15.080 --> 33:16.342
and how long
you were there for.

33:16.516 --> 33:18.431
What if the suspect
didn't have a phone on them?

33:18.605 --> 33:20.650
Most modern cars have
a cellular connection, right?

33:20.824 --> 33:23.088
So they update GPS in real-time
traffic data.

33:23.262 --> 33:24.872
If our sedan had one,
its vehicle track

33:25.046 --> 33:27.657
is most likely in Wavehook.

33:27.831 --> 33:29.485
So, what we're looking for
is a hit

33:29.659 --> 33:33.098
that matches our sedan's
movement at 745...

33:35.274 --> 33:38.581
Boom. Now, we just ping
the last known location.

33:41.019 --> 33:42.977
That's it.
The car's at the Emerald Inn

33:43.151 --> 33:44.326
and so is the kidnapper.

33:44.500 --> 33:46.589
- Let's go get him.
- Atta boy.

34:02.562 --> 34:05.217
All right, be right back.
Stay in the car.

34:05.391 --> 34:06.435
What are you...
what are you talking about?

34:06.609 --> 34:07.915
We have a person of interest
in there

34:08.089 --> 34:09.786
that we need answers from
and if you go in

34:09.960 --> 34:11.962
and lose control,
we will not get those answers.

34:12.137 --> 34:13.877
Okay, I don't care
about answers, right now.

34:14.052 --> 34:15.140
That's why you're
staying here.

34:15.314 --> 34:17.185
And I'm not asking.

34:17.359 --> 34:19.144
Oh, it's an ord...

34:19.318 --> 34:21.146
You're giving me an order?
You won't listen to me

34:21.320 --> 34:22.799
as the mother of your children,
so damn right,

34:22.973 --> 34:25.019
I am giving you an order
as your supervisor.

34:25.193 --> 34:27.456
- Do you understand?
- Yes, I understand.

34:27.630 --> 34:29.545
Great. Now, I'm gonna
go inside
and ask the front desk

34:29.719 --> 34:31.199
what room our suspect is in.

34:31.373 --> 34:32.635
Okay. I'll just be in here.

34:58.574 --> 34:59.662
Come on, Jay...

35:03.666 --> 35:04.667
Great.

35:30.519 --> 35:31.694
What happened?

35:32.869 --> 35:34.001
Nothing.

35:35.829 --> 35:37.570
What happened to staying
in the car?

35:38.875 --> 35:40.268
We missed him.

35:41.661 --> 35:42.792
He was right here
and we missed him.

35:43.750 --> 35:45.099
Her.

35:52.150 --> 35:54.064
The suspect that rented
this room...

35:57.633 --> 35:59.679
...the clerk said
it was a woman.

37:06.441 --> 37:07.790
You're okay, now.

37:09.662 --> 37:10.793
You're okay, now.

37:14.667 --> 37:16.538
Asher.

37:16.712 --> 37:18.671
That was his name.
The boy that you killed.

37:18.845 --> 37:20.542
I just...

37:20.716 --> 37:22.283
...needed you
to know his name.

37:22.457 --> 37:23.893
I got her, I got her,
I got her.

37:24.067 --> 37:26.026
Asher Gallagher...

37:26.200 --> 37:28.028
It's okay, he heard...
He heard you.

37:29.203 --> 37:31.118
He heard you, it's okay.

37:40.432 --> 37:42.085
<i>I just wanted
to say thank you.</i>

37:42.260 --> 37:45.654
<i>For bringing him back,
however briefly.</i>

37:45.828 --> 37:48.396
<i>I really thought
I'd lost him and...</i>

37:48.570 --> 37:49.919
<i>...it's nice to know
that he's still here.</i>

38:01.757 --> 38:02.976
I just can't...

38:03.150 --> 38:05.021
I can't believe
how close we were.

38:05.195 --> 38:08.373
And we'll get close again.
Okay? Justice will come.

38:08.547 --> 38:10.853
You know, what Keith needs
right now is his family.

38:12.333 --> 38:14.379
He needs people
around him who care.

38:14.553 --> 38:15.945
He needs his life back.

38:16.119 --> 38:17.251
And...

38:18.339 --> 38:20.820
you need to go see June.

38:20.994 --> 38:23.170
Grovel, beg, or whatever
it is that you need to do.

38:26.173 --> 38:27.435
June is good people.

38:29.611 --> 38:31.439
I don't know what she sees
in you, but...

38:33.702 --> 38:35.878
...whatever it is,
you know, just...

38:38.228 --> 38:40.709
...go remind her of it.

38:44.191 --> 38:45.148
Thank you.

39:05.778 --> 39:08.258
I should have spotted
the car sooner.

39:08.433 --> 39:10.609
And maybe if I had, she would
have still been at the motel.

39:12.480 --> 39:14.526
Well, Keith being back
is complicated.

39:16.658 --> 39:18.312
It's a lot more complicated
than I ever

39:18.486 --> 39:19.966
dreamed it would be
when he was gone.

39:20.140 --> 39:21.663
Well, I don't want
to make it more complicated

39:21.837 --> 39:23.012
than it already is.

39:26.929 --> 39:28.148
Jason's gonna be
at the house a lot.

39:30.193 --> 39:32.631
In the morning. At night.
I get it.

39:32.805 --> 39:34.110
But he is not staying over.

39:35.068 --> 39:36.417
- Ever.
- Nicole...

39:43.293 --> 39:44.730
I understand.

39:46.862 --> 39:48.603
How can you possibly
understand?

39:49.778 --> 39:50.953
Because...

39:52.390 --> 39:53.521
...I'm an incredible person.

39:56.524 --> 39:58.787
- Is that a fact?
- That is a fact.

39:58.961 --> 40:01.660
Face it, girl,
you're marrying up.

40:01.834 --> 40:03.705
Can I have my ring back?

40:03.879 --> 40:05.446
Anytime you want.

40:17.458 --> 40:18.546
June.

40:30.384 --> 40:31.994
Hey, Sid?

40:33.518 --> 40:34.997
Keith?

40:41.177 --> 40:44.746
I have proof. That he's
not who he says he is.

40:44.920 --> 40:46.269
What is going on with you?

40:49.055 --> 40:50.535
You look for clues all day.

40:52.711 --> 40:53.581
Can you find the one in that?

41:03.069 --> 41:04.244
I can.

41:06.507 --> 41:08.596
But it's not the one
you think it is.

41:09.989 --> 41:11.947
He's writing
with his right hand.

41:12.121 --> 41:14.123
My brother is left-handed.

41:14.297 --> 41:17.213
He was. He is not anymore.

41:17.387 --> 41:19.172
Mom, people don't just
change like that.

41:19.346 --> 41:20.434
Oh, honey...

41:22.392 --> 41:24.351
When Keith was hospitalized,
they ran tests.

41:25.918 --> 41:28.573
X-rays that show
that he was abused.

41:28.747 --> 41:31.140
He suffered multiple fractures,

41:31.314 --> 41:33.534
including fractures
to the bones in his left hand,

41:33.708 --> 41:35.623
so yeah, you're right.

41:37.669 --> 41:39.105
People don't change
if they don't have to.

41:41.237 --> 41:43.370
But your brother,
he had no choice.

41:46.155 --> 41:47.113
Hey, baby.

41:52.292 --> 41:54.903
I'm... I'm sorry
I don't wanna talk about it.

41:55.077 --> 41:57.689
Oh, no, no, don't be.

41:57.863 --> 41:59.691
I'm the one who should apologize
for asking you to.

42:03.085 --> 42:04.130
I mean, it's hard to believe

42:05.566 --> 42:06.524
that all this was...

42:07.916 --> 42:09.091
You don't recognize yourself.

42:10.484 --> 42:11.529
I understand.

42:13.661 --> 42:16.882
You are nothing like
you used to be.

42:17.056 --> 42:20.102
And yet you are everything
I ever want you to be.

42:21.974 --> 42:22.975
I wish Sidney felt that way.

42:24.019 --> 42:25.499
Oh, she will. She will.

42:25.673 --> 42:26.369
It's...

42:27.762 --> 42:30.373
It's a big adjustment.

42:30.548 --> 42:33.420
But sooner or later,
she is going to embrace you

42:33.594 --> 42:34.900
just like Dad and I do.
