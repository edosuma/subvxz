WEBVTT

00:28.376 --> 00:30.334
Okay, I know, I know.

00:30.378 --> 00:33.729
I know--come here, come here.
Hi, hi, hi, hi.

00:33.772 --> 00:35.383
You're okay.

00:35.426 --> 00:38.690
Hey, you're okay. You're okay.

00:55.664 --> 00:58.101
- Look, the air
quality's terrible.

00:58.145 --> 00:59.668
My guess is allergies.

00:59.711 --> 01:01.713
When you hear hoofbeats,
think horses,

01:01.757 --> 01:03.759
not zebras, okay?

01:03.802 --> 01:06.153
Our treatment's been working,
your tumor's been responding.

01:06.196 --> 01:08.329
Let's not panic just yet.

01:37.271 --> 01:39.577
- Felt like the city was...

01:39.621 --> 01:42.145
screaming in my face all night.

01:43.842 --> 01:48.195
Well, that means you definitely
should stay right here in bed.

01:55.637 --> 01:59.728
- Is everything all right?

01:59.771 --> 02:03.123
- I'm just tired.

02:03.166 --> 02:05.429
Give me a few minutes,
and I'll be right.

02:21.837 --> 02:24.405
- Hey, you.

02:24.448 --> 02:26.624
- Ah, so this is where
the party's at.

02:26.668 --> 02:29.758
- Uh, yeah, I do feel good.

02:29.801 --> 02:31.629
- Thanks to the 12-straight
hours of morphine

02:31.673 --> 02:33.805
Dr. Handler has been pumping
into your system.

02:33.849 --> 02:36.591
- Okay, whatever. I mean,
like I even need morphine.

02:36.634 --> 02:40.334
With my tolerance,
I'm not even high right now.

02:40.377 --> 02:42.205
- Well, I must say,
for a woman that just

02:42.249 --> 02:44.642
went through major
reconstructive leg surgery,

02:44.686 --> 02:47.558
you look absolutely ravishing.

02:47.602 --> 02:50.518
- Really?

02:50.561 --> 02:51.649
- No.

02:51.693 --> 02:52.824
And if you believe that,

02:52.868 --> 02:55.175
then you're
most assuredly high.

02:57.829 --> 02:59.527
Party's over.

03:05.533 --> 03:07.709
- Martha Randle, collapsed
in her cell at Rikers.

03:07.752 --> 03:09.841
She's G3P4 with
a history of fibroids

03:09.885 --> 03:11.582
producing heavy menstrual flow.

03:11.626 --> 03:13.845
Hypotensive,
tachycardic, and febrile.

03:13.889 --> 03:15.934
Also complaining
of numbness in her leg.

03:15.978 --> 03:17.632
- Can you please tell me
where is the numbness?

03:17.675 --> 03:19.416
- Up and down my right leg.

03:19.460 --> 03:20.939
- Okay.

03:22.767 --> 03:24.856
Can you please lift
your leg for me?

03:27.903 --> 03:30.558
- Wait.

03:30.601 --> 03:32.647
What's wrong with me?

03:32.690 --> 03:34.214
I can't move my leg.

03:34.257 --> 03:35.998
I can't move my leg.

03:36.041 --> 03:37.869
- Dr. Proctor, this is Martha.

03:37.913 --> 03:39.523
- Martha, I'm an OB/GYN.

03:39.567 --> 03:41.395
We're going to get
you sorted out, okay?

03:41.438 --> 03:42.874
I need to order blood
and urine cultures.

03:42.918 --> 03:44.789
- I think you'll
find Staph aureus.

03:44.833 --> 03:46.269
- Toxic shock?

03:46.313 --> 03:47.531
- Martha,
have you been using tampons

03:47.575 --> 03:48.924
for longer than recommended?

03:50.055 --> 03:52.014
- I used my last one...

03:52.057 --> 03:53.581
for nine...

03:53.624 --> 03:55.409
- Nine hours shouldn't
cause this much damage.

03:55.452 --> 03:57.715
- She means nine days.

03:57.759 --> 04:00.892
Alert me the moment
the MRI is ready.

04:00.936 --> 04:02.764
- Nine days?
How did you know?

04:02.807 --> 04:04.940
- Martha is not my
first patient from Rikers

04:04.983 --> 04:06.333
with toxic shock.

04:06.376 --> 04:08.639
How many more
before someone dies?

04:08.683 --> 04:11.686
- Where are we going?
- To find Max.

04:11.729 --> 04:13.253
- Mm.

04:13.296 --> 04:15.255
- Max, I didn't think
you were gonna make it.

04:15.298 --> 04:17.039
- Well, it's a very busy day,
then I heard you were

04:17.082 --> 04:18.997
running my best doctor out
of town, so I made some time.

04:19.041 --> 04:20.695
- Honestly, Max,
I can handle it.

04:20.738 --> 04:22.262
- Yeah, I know you can,
but you shouldn't have to

04:22.305 --> 04:23.567
because you did nothing wrong.

04:23.611 --> 04:26.396
- She was arrested
in a heroin den.

04:26.440 --> 04:27.963
- Safe injection sites
aren't flop houses.

04:28.006 --> 04:30.313
They're the future.
And for helping her patient,

04:30.357 --> 04:31.749
who most doctors would
have let die in the street,

04:31.793 --> 04:33.708
you want to reprimand
the most accomplished,

04:33.751 --> 04:35.579
most selfless,
not to mention coolest

04:35.623 --> 04:36.928
doctor in this hospital?

04:36.972 --> 04:39.931
- She broke the law.
She got caught.

04:39.975 --> 04:43.283
You'll have our disciplinary
action by end of day.

04:45.937 --> 04:47.765
- Imagine if you
hadn't have turned up.

04:47.809 --> 04:49.027
That might've gone poorly.

04:49.071 --> 04:51.334
Why didn't you tell me?

04:51.378 --> 04:52.944
I didn't hear any
of this until I--

04:52.988 --> 04:54.424
- I didn't want to burden you.

04:54.468 --> 04:57.601
- Burden me.

04:57.645 --> 04:59.516
- Please, always.

05:01.910 --> 05:03.868
- Max...

05:03.912 --> 05:06.436
we need to talk about Rikers.

05:06.480 --> 05:09.613
Martha Randle is in Rikers
for marijuana possession,

05:09.657 --> 05:11.963
and now she may not live
to see the end of her sentence.

05:12.007 --> 05:14.705
- It's not just tampons.
I've had a dozen patients

05:14.749 --> 05:16.925
tell me that pap smears and
mammograms are being withheld

05:16.968 --> 05:18.753
as punishment,
and now they have cancer.

05:18.796 --> 05:20.494
- So much of this
is preventable.

05:20.537 --> 05:22.365
One routine visit at Rikers,

05:22.409 --> 05:24.759
and most of my inmate
patients wouldn't even be here.

05:24.802 --> 05:27.718
- Hey, guys, I got the 911.
What's going on?

05:27.762 --> 05:30.025
- Uh, Rikers.
- Rikers again?

05:30.068 --> 05:31.809
Man, that place
is a mental-health catastrophe.

05:31.853 --> 05:33.376
My patients go in for a month,

05:33.420 --> 05:34.812
they come out
with a lifetime of trauma.

05:34.856 --> 05:36.031
- Hey, anybody else thinking
what I'm thinking?

05:36.074 --> 05:37.641
- That basic preventative care

05:37.685 --> 05:38.860
would cut the rate
of illness in half there?

05:38.903 --> 05:40.383
- That's not what
he's thinking.

05:40.427 --> 05:41.993
- No?
How many more guesses do I get?

05:42.037 --> 05:44.474
- Casey, grab me
ten exam table rolls,

05:44.518 --> 05:46.476
ten boxes of paper
patient gowns, and all

05:46.520 --> 05:48.522
the female hygiene products
you can fit in the van.

05:48.565 --> 05:50.698
- The van?
- Yeah, also get a van.

05:50.741 --> 05:52.613
- Oh, that's what
he was thinking.

05:52.656 --> 05:54.832
- Wait, you're not
serious, are you?

05:54.876 --> 05:56.660
- Whatever you're in jail
for doesn't mean you deserve

05:56.704 --> 05:58.488
to die because you
couldn't get a checkup.

05:58.532 --> 06:00.011
These women are our patients.

06:00.055 --> 06:02.492
They need our help, and we're
gonna give it to them,

06:02.536 --> 06:04.842
so we are going to Rikers.

- Sir, New Amsterdam
doctors are here.

07:28.404 --> 07:29.623
- Warden Hughes,
I'm Dr. Goodwin.

07:29.666 --> 07:31.363
Thanks for having us.

07:31.407 --> 07:33.453
We're very excited
to get our clinic under way.

07:33.496 --> 07:35.542
The mayor said that
you could show us around?

07:35.585 --> 07:37.500
- Did he?
- Let's go, ladies!

07:37.544 --> 07:40.285
- Well, this is
the dining hall.

07:40.329 --> 07:43.114
Upstairs is the rec room.

07:43.158 --> 07:45.508
Through there
are the cell blocks,

07:45.552 --> 07:47.554
and that concludes our tour.

07:47.597 --> 07:49.860
- Thanks for your hospitality.

07:49.904 --> 07:52.776
- Look, I tried to stop this
fiasco every step of the way,

07:52.820 --> 07:55.126
but seeing as the mayor
answers your calls

07:55.170 --> 07:57.128
and not mine, follow me.

07:58.739 --> 08:00.741
- Play nice.

08:00.784 --> 08:02.656
- Warden, I get that you
don't appreciate me

08:02.699 --> 08:04.484
going over your head
to the mayor, but our goal

08:04.527 --> 08:06.616
is not to embarrass you
or to get in your way.

08:06.660 --> 08:08.531
- You're 0 for 2 there, Doc.

08:08.575 --> 08:10.490
- We just want
to provide basic checkups.

08:10.533 --> 08:12.535
A one-day clinic to treat
your female inmate population.

08:12.579 --> 08:14.319
- For everyone?
- That's right.

08:14.363 --> 08:15.930
All 600 of the women
incarcerated here.

08:15.973 --> 08:17.671
- With zero prep time
and no additional COs--

08:17.714 --> 08:19.499
hell of a plan.

08:19.542 --> 08:21.457
- I imagine Martha Randle
would say that any plan

08:21.501 --> 08:22.763
is better than
what you have now,

08:22.806 --> 08:24.895
or she wouldn't
be in our hospital.

08:24.939 --> 08:27.594
- If you'd like to donate a box
of tampons, we'll take them.

08:27.637 --> 08:30.510
Beyond that,
if inmate Randle felt sick,

08:30.553 --> 08:32.294
she should've gone
to Sick Call.

08:32.337 --> 08:35.427
- She did, and they said that
she didn't seem sick.

08:35.471 --> 08:38.256
This was a full day before she
collapsed from a massive stroke

08:38.300 --> 08:41.433
caused by poison, so I can see
how she'd seem fine.

08:43.392 --> 08:44.915
- What happened
to playing nice?

08:44.959 --> 08:46.700
- I said you play nice.

08:46.743 --> 08:48.571
- Oh, good cop, bad cop.
I love it.

08:48.615 --> 08:49.964
Very appropriate.

08:50.007 --> 08:52.357
- Liars, liars!
You're all liars!

08:55.491 --> 08:57.841
Oh, that's right!
Oh, that's right!

08:57.885 --> 08:59.669
I'm crazy, huh?
- That's enough!

08:59.713 --> 09:03.325
- Get off of me!
- This is the examination room.

09:06.415 --> 09:07.851
Your attention.

09:07.895 --> 09:09.810
The New Amsterdam doctors

09:09.853 --> 09:12.247
are here to tell you
how to do your job.

09:14.554 --> 09:16.773
- Sorry, this is it?

09:16.817 --> 09:18.819
Um...where do you provide

09:18.862 --> 09:20.777
pap smears or procedures
that require undressing?

09:20.821 --> 09:22.474
- Right here.

09:22.518 --> 09:24.694
- What about mental health?
You--you do that here?

09:24.738 --> 09:26.435
- Everything, right here.

09:26.478 --> 09:29.569
- But no one is going to ask
for care without privacy.

09:29.612 --> 09:30.961
This is what's
causing your problem.

09:31.005 --> 09:33.573
- Our problem is
a health-care budget

09:33.616 --> 09:36.358
of about
$5 per inmate per day.

09:36.401 --> 09:38.752
We had a heroin overdose
this morning, and that's half

09:38.795 --> 09:42.233
of today's cash gone--
it's not even lunchtime yet.

09:42.277 --> 09:44.366
We're doing the best
we can with what we have.

09:44.409 --> 09:46.281
Now, I'm a results guy.

09:46.324 --> 09:49.501
If you can improve things, I'll
be the first to say thanks.

09:49.545 --> 09:51.416
And if you can't,

09:51.460 --> 09:53.636
I'll be the first to tell
the Mayor all about it.

10:00.469 --> 10:02.340
- Suspected heroin OD
from Rikers.

10:02.384 --> 10:03.733
Severe pulmonary distress.

10:03.777 --> 10:05.605
- Did you push Narcan?
- Two amps, no response.

10:05.648 --> 10:07.737
- She might be having
pulmonary edema.

10:07.781 --> 10:10.522
Renal function?
- Creatinine is 1.8 and rising.

10:10.566 --> 10:11.698
- What's that mean?

10:11.741 --> 10:13.613
- Push 60 mg IV Lasix.

10:13.656 --> 10:16.267
Set up an intubation tray
and a stat cardiac echo.

10:16.311 --> 10:19.488
It means she's in trouble.

10:27.844 --> 10:30.325
- Just breathe.

10:31.500 --> 10:34.503
I want a pill.

10:34.546 --> 10:35.809
- I bet you do.

10:35.852 --> 10:37.506
- No, I am serious, Zach.

10:37.549 --> 10:40.030
- You asked me
to monitor your hydrocodone--

10:40.074 --> 10:42.467
a job I happen
to take seriously.

10:42.511 --> 10:44.295
So here's the deal.

10:44.339 --> 10:46.950
Over the next 24 hours,
you're allowed four pills,

10:46.994 --> 10:51.346
so this
has to last you six hours.

10:51.389 --> 10:53.609
What I recommend
is that you wait...

10:53.653 --> 10:55.350
you take this in one hour.

10:55.393 --> 10:57.961
- Can I take, like,
half now and then half later?

10:58.005 --> 10:59.702
- If you want
to sacrifice pain management

10:59.746 --> 11:02.879
in the name of a quick
and dirty fix, go nuts.

11:02.923 --> 11:05.099
But for maximum pain relief,

11:05.142 --> 11:06.927
wait one hour.

11:15.500 --> 11:16.893
Fine.

11:16.937 --> 11:19.722
- Brilliant.
See you in 60.

11:19.766 --> 11:21.942
Lucky me.

11:30.167 --> 11:33.780
- Martha, count backwards
from five, please.

11:33.823 --> 11:35.607
- Five...

11:35.651 --> 11:38.828
four, three...

11:38.872 --> 11:41.004
- Very good.

11:41.048 --> 11:42.832
I'm going to ask some
questions and your answers

11:42.876 --> 11:44.747
will let me observe
your brain function.

11:44.791 --> 11:46.488
Do you have children?

11:46.531 --> 11:48.446
- Yes.

11:48.490 --> 11:50.057
- Very good.

11:50.100 --> 11:52.407
Now, if you could
share a memory.

11:52.450 --> 11:54.714
Any happy one will do.

11:55.932 --> 11:58.021
- My son's fourth birthday...

11:58.065 --> 12:00.807
we went to this play center.

12:00.850 --> 12:03.723
Ball pits, arcades...

12:04.898 --> 12:08.075
Man, he loved it.

12:10.599 --> 12:12.819
There was this--this room

12:12.862 --> 12:16.083
full of trampolines,
wall to wall.

12:17.693 --> 12:21.175
And Darrell charged in like
a lunatic, doing flips,

12:21.218 --> 12:24.744
making faces.

12:27.094 --> 12:30.053
And his smile was just...

12:41.630 --> 12:42.892
- Do they visit?

12:45.677 --> 12:47.810
- Some people at Rikers,
if they know you got kids

12:47.854 --> 12:50.421
and they want
something from you...

12:54.643 --> 12:56.906
It's better that
they don't come.

13:00.997 --> 13:03.695
Did you find what you needed?

13:06.742 --> 13:09.658
- Martha, it appears
you have a marantic embolism.

13:09.701 --> 13:12.139
The bacteria
from our vaginal infection

13:12.182 --> 13:14.097
has traveled to your brain.

13:14.141 --> 13:16.621
We need to remove
the clot surgically.

13:26.240 --> 13:27.719
- Um, hi.

13:27.763 --> 13:29.765
A moment of your
attention, everybody.

13:29.809 --> 13:33.160
- Everybody, listen up.

13:33.203 --> 13:34.857
- Uh, yeah, hi, guys.

13:34.901 --> 13:37.164
My name is Dr. Frome,
I'm from New Amsterdam.

13:37.207 --> 13:39.644
And I noticed that
your exam room here

13:39.688 --> 13:41.255
is a little on the small side,

13:41.298 --> 13:44.084
so I'm setting up shop
in the consult room to discuss

13:44.127 --> 13:47.261
really anything
that's on your minds.

13:47.304 --> 13:48.871
Free of charge.
- Yo, we got

13:48.915 --> 13:51.091
this old Humpty Dumpty-looking
fool up in here.

13:52.875 --> 13:55.660
Yo, Dopey, where the rest
of the seven dwarves at?

13:55.704 --> 13:57.706
- That's good.
- Show some respect, inmate.

13:57.749 --> 14:00.665
- That's okay, I can handle it.
I've been to middle school.

14:00.709 --> 14:04.234
- Ooh, Doc got jokes.

14:04.278 --> 14:08.151
- What'd I say, Pearl?
Keep talking, it's a write-up.

14:10.197 --> 14:12.025
- May I?

14:12.068 --> 14:13.678
Hi.

14:13.722 --> 14:16.159
It's Pearl, right?
- Mm-hmm.

14:16.203 --> 14:17.726
- Is it always like
that between you two,

14:17.769 --> 14:19.249
or you just putting
on a little show for me?

14:19.293 --> 14:21.861
- That's how CO Sanchez is.

14:21.904 --> 14:23.950
Want to know why there
ain't no trees on Rikers?

14:23.993 --> 14:25.734
- I don't know, do I?

14:25.777 --> 14:27.997
- Sanchez needed 'em all
for the big stick up...

14:28.041 --> 14:29.781
Wait, you writing me up?

14:29.825 --> 14:31.174
- I said you keep talking,
it's a write-up.

14:31.218 --> 14:32.784
You just kept talking.

14:32.828 --> 14:34.612
- Oh, no, no,
I asked her a question.

14:34.656 --> 14:36.092
She was answering my question.
- Take her out of here.

14:36.136 --> 14:37.659
Rec privileges revoked.

14:37.702 --> 14:39.182
- Hold on, hold on,
I asked her a question.

14:39.226 --> 14:42.664
- You a punk, Sucia Sanchez.

14:42.707 --> 14:45.710
No wonder you're
free of charge.

14:47.321 --> 14:50.324
- If this is real,
I swear to God...

14:50.367 --> 14:52.326
- They set up in the cafeteria.

14:54.632 --> 14:57.679
- Nurse Kamoe, can we get these
two to the urgent-care table?

14:57.722 --> 14:59.028
- Right this way.

15:01.988 --> 15:03.728
- Not a word.
Shut it down.

15:03.772 --> 15:04.991
This is over.

15:09.647 --> 15:11.998
- Warden, you said
that if I can improve things,

15:12.041 --> 15:13.695
you'd be the first to admit it.

15:13.738 --> 15:15.566
Well, this is an improvement.
- Improvement?

15:15.610 --> 15:17.046
You're in flagrant
violation of regulations.

15:17.090 --> 15:18.656
The exam room isn't small
for the hell of it.

15:18.700 --> 15:19.962
The COs need
a clear line of vision

15:20.006 --> 15:21.007
on the inmates at all times.

15:21.050 --> 15:22.747
- Yeah, and they've got one.

15:22.791 --> 15:25.054
The patients get privacy,
and the COs can still see.

15:25.098 --> 15:26.664
- You were given enough COs

15:26.708 --> 15:28.318
to secure a hallway,
not an open area.

15:28.362 --> 15:30.233
There are 50 people
in this line.

15:30.277 --> 15:33.323
The regulations regarding
COs-to-inmate ratios are clear.

15:33.367 --> 15:34.672
Shut it down.

15:34.716 --> 15:36.370
- Can we rotate more COs in?

15:36.413 --> 15:38.111
- With written permission
from their union.

15:38.154 --> 15:39.634
Should take about a month.

15:41.984 --> 15:43.290
- Yo.

15:43.333 --> 15:44.639
You here for back pain?

15:44.682 --> 15:46.293
Form a line in A Block hallway.

15:47.990 --> 15:50.166
Come on.
Let's go--A Block.

15:50.210 --> 15:52.603
Did I stutter?
Let's do this.

15:52.647 --> 15:54.692
Word's got out
y'all got new mattresses.

15:54.736 --> 15:57.826
Most folks here crying back
pain are just angling for dibs.

15:57.869 --> 15:59.349
- Lambona.

16:00.829 --> 16:02.874
- Ignore her scheming ass.

16:02.918 --> 16:04.920
A Block's got their own Cos,

16:04.964 --> 16:08.968
so that should ratio
y'all's ratios, right?

16:09.011 --> 16:10.360
Game on.

16:12.232 --> 16:14.364
- Thank you.
Max Goodwin.

16:15.887 --> 16:17.846
- Jackie Connor.

16:19.152 --> 16:21.241
- Farther...

16:21.284 --> 16:23.808
Almost there.

16:25.680 --> 16:29.901
Mm.
A little farther...

16:29.945 --> 16:31.816
Looking good.

16:31.860 --> 16:35.298
And the clot is out.

16:35.342 --> 16:37.300
Will you please inform
Ms. Randle's family?

16:37.344 --> 16:39.999
- Can't do that.

16:40.042 --> 16:42.392
- They should know Martha's
procedure was successful.

16:42.436 --> 16:44.351
- No can do.
It's a security risk

16:44.394 --> 16:46.396
to let them know
she's out of Rikers at all.

16:50.748 --> 16:52.054
- She almost died.

16:52.098 --> 16:54.274
You don't want
her children to know?

16:54.317 --> 16:57.233
Her husband?
To offer comfort?

17:02.369 --> 17:05.415
- Pearl, you got a visitor.

17:05.459 --> 17:07.113
- Seriously, dude?

17:07.156 --> 17:08.853
You trying to get me
thrown in the SHU?

17:08.897 --> 17:11.160
- No, no, I came to apologize.

17:11.204 --> 17:13.336
I did not mean to cause
any trouble for you.

17:13.380 --> 17:14.859
- It's not your fault.

17:14.903 --> 17:16.774
Sanchez is always
up my ass for no reason.

17:16.818 --> 17:19.864
Last week she gave me a shot
for excessive eye-rolling.

17:19.908 --> 17:21.779
- Wow.

17:21.823 --> 17:24.043
You know, power structures,
they can--they can get muddy.

17:24.086 --> 17:26.001
- Save it, Doc.

17:26.045 --> 17:28.873
Sucia Sanchez is just mean,

17:28.917 --> 17:31.267
always has been.

17:33.835 --> 17:36.011
- You mean
since you've been here?

17:37.317 --> 17:40.189
- Since Mrs. Brenneman's
second grade class!

17:41.930 --> 17:43.366
- Oh.

17:43.410 --> 17:47.109
- Yeah, we were friends.
Sucia Sanchez and Burly Pearly.

17:47.153 --> 17:48.980
- Yeah, so what happened?

17:49.024 --> 17:51.853
- She got her ass arrested
and put in my jail.

17:51.896 --> 17:53.855
Doc, I know half
the women in here.

17:53.898 --> 17:56.727
I treat them all the same.
- Yeah, except you don't.

17:56.771 --> 18:00.340
That write-up you gave Pearl
felt pretty personal.

18:00.383 --> 18:03.082
- I'm a female CO.
The men watch.

18:03.125 --> 18:05.214
They see you
go soft for one second,

18:05.258 --> 18:07.129
that's your career.

18:07.173 --> 18:08.957
- Right.
- So, yeah...

18:09.000 --> 18:10.350
it's a tight leash on Pearl.

18:10.393 --> 18:12.308
That's Rikers, bro.

18:12.352 --> 18:13.875
That bridge outside--

18:13.918 --> 18:17.096
you leave your friendships
at the other end.

18:21.230 --> 18:23.406
Okay...

18:31.849 --> 18:33.373
Oh, come on...

18:59.007 --> 19:00.443
Oh, yes.

19:00.487 --> 19:01.879
Oh, God, okay.

19:22.857 --> 19:25.903
- And table three is now open.
Don't make me repeat myself.

19:25.947 --> 19:28.254
Natasha, get on up there.

19:28.297 --> 19:30.560
Yeah, Lindsay, it's cool,
just take your time.

19:30.604 --> 19:32.127
It's not like
there are, you know,

19:32.171 --> 19:33.911
sick people here or anything.

19:33.955 --> 19:36.218
- When you get out of here,
just call me for a job.

19:36.262 --> 19:37.872
- Do I look like
I have time to chitchat?

19:37.915 --> 19:39.178
Just move the trash.

19:43.356 --> 19:44.835
- You okay?

19:44.879 --> 19:47.534
- Uh, yeah, just,
um, swallowed funny.

19:47.577 --> 19:49.623
- You didn't look
like you swallowed funny.

19:49.666 --> 19:51.277
- I keep telling my face

19:51.320 --> 19:53.235
to do the swallowed-funny
expression better.

19:53.279 --> 19:56.325
- You keep asking me to burden
you, but that goes both ways.

19:56.369 --> 19:58.240
- Hey, you have a second?

19:58.284 --> 19:59.633
- Sure, what's up?

19:59.676 --> 20:01.243
- It's not for me,
it's my girlfriend.

20:01.287 --> 20:03.506
She's got some intense
symptoms going on.

20:03.550 --> 20:06.509
Big mood swings out of nowhere,
putting on some weight.

20:06.553 --> 20:08.381
But she's too embarrassed
to ask for help.

20:08.424 --> 20:10.513
Could you--
- Of course, where is she?

20:10.557 --> 20:12.254
- Solitary.

20:15.126 --> 20:17.259
- Well, you're gonna have
to hand over those bags.

20:17.303 --> 20:18.608
You can't bring those in here.

20:18.652 --> 20:20.523
- Well, we need
tools to treat her.

20:20.567 --> 20:22.395
- Right, and I need
the dangerous inmate

20:22.438 --> 20:25.136
not to get her hands on things
she can kill you with.

20:25.180 --> 20:27.008
The bags?
- Makes sense.

20:32.579 --> 20:36.322
Charly, you got company.

20:42.284 --> 20:44.634
- Charly, these folks
are here to see you.

20:46.984 --> 20:48.943
- It's okay.

20:48.986 --> 20:52.120
Hi, uh, I'm Max Goodwin,
and this is Helen Sharpe.

20:52.163 --> 20:54.862
We're doctors,
and we're here to help you.

20:54.905 --> 20:57.256
- Your girlfriend, Dezi, said
that you were experiencing

20:57.299 --> 21:00.607
some problems, uh,
so she asked us to come by.

21:00.650 --> 21:03.479
How are you feeling?

21:03.523 --> 21:05.133
- Um...

21:05.176 --> 21:08.876
can you...can you describe
your symptoms?

21:10.486 --> 21:12.575
- Uh, are you
pulling your hair out,

21:12.619 --> 21:15.143
or is it coming out on its own?

21:19.800 --> 21:23.194
- You mind if I take a look?
Is that okay?

21:23.238 --> 21:24.848
Just...

21:24.892 --> 21:26.807
Your specific pattern
of hair loss may be--

21:26.850 --> 21:28.156
- Don't touch me.

21:28.199 --> 21:29.984
- Watch it, Charly.
- We're okay.

21:30.027 --> 21:31.942
Sorry.

21:31.986 --> 21:35.250
- Back up.
You back the hell up.

21:36.904 --> 21:39.646
Coming in here laughing at me?

21:42.779 --> 21:44.303
You laughing at me?

21:44.346 --> 21:45.913
Huh?
Answer me.

21:45.956 --> 21:47.218
- Nobody
is laughing at you.

21:47.262 --> 21:49.482
- Oh...

21:49.525 --> 21:51.527
you don't laugh at me.

21:51.571 --> 21:53.660
I laugh at you.

21:53.703 --> 21:55.879
Okay.

21:58.229 --> 22:00.014
- Charly, Dezi said...

22:00.057 --> 22:01.624
- You don't say her name!

22:01.668 --> 22:03.974
Get out! Get out!

22:06.325 --> 22:07.543
- Are you okay?
- Yep.

22:07.587 --> 22:10.154
- Get the hell out of here!

22:10.198 --> 22:13.157
- Come on, let's go.

22:13.201 --> 22:15.203
- You know,
holding down that call button

22:15.246 --> 22:16.683
won't get me here any faster.

22:16.726 --> 22:18.902
- I'm sorry.
I-I need another pill.

22:18.946 --> 22:20.600
- What happened
to the one that you had?

22:20.643 --> 22:22.123
- It's gone. I have looked
everywhere for it.

22:22.166 --> 22:23.646
- Gone?

22:23.690 --> 22:24.952
- Look, someone
must've come in here

22:24.995 --> 22:26.693
and cleaned
while I was asleep--

22:26.736 --> 22:28.608
- Dr. Bloom, we can't just
give you another pill.

22:28.651 --> 22:30.087
- Says who?
- Says you, remember?

22:30.131 --> 22:31.872
"No matter what I say,
don't give me anything

22:31.915 --> 22:33.743
more than what's prescribed."
- That was different.

22:33.787 --> 22:35.832
That was to stop me
from abusing the medication.

22:35.876 --> 22:38.531
Just test my blood.
You'll see that I'm clean.

22:38.574 --> 22:39.836
- We can't.
The morphine from

22:39.880 --> 22:41.185
this morning
is still in your system.

22:41.229 --> 22:42.839
- Oh, my God,
all I'm asking for

22:42.883 --> 22:44.624
is that you replace one,
tiny little pill.

22:44.667 --> 22:46.974
Is that too much to ask?
- I will page Dr. Ligon, okay?

22:47.017 --> 22:49.716
- No, Eddie, you know what?
I'm sorry, I'm just...

22:49.759 --> 22:52.719
I'm just in so...so much pain.

22:57.071 --> 22:59.900
- So why not thyroid disease?
That would explain the hair.

22:59.943 --> 23:01.728
- Charly was
the opposite of restless,

23:01.771 --> 23:03.730
and she wasn't sweating.
- Keep it moving, please.

23:03.773 --> 23:05.906
- Then ringworm
or a fungal infection.

23:05.949 --> 23:07.690
- Makes sense with the hair,
but you're ignoring

23:07.734 --> 23:09.823
what we saw when she just
stood up--she was wobbling.

23:09.866 --> 23:11.955
- If the muscular weakness
started around the same time

23:11.999 --> 23:14.610
as the behavioral changes,
then it could be heart disease.

23:14.654 --> 23:16.786
- You're thinking about the
distention in her neck veins.

23:16.830 --> 23:18.571
- Yeah, or even
rheumatoid arthritis.

23:18.614 --> 23:20.747
- Time to go.
- Uh, just--not done.

23:20.790 --> 23:22.792
- Let me save you some time.
She's nuts.

23:22.836 --> 23:24.881
- Hair loss, venous distention,
weight gain--

23:24.925 --> 23:27.014
she's got so many symptoms
that any doctor would want her

23:27.057 --> 23:29.146
under observation
yesterday, but to simply

23:29.190 --> 23:33.977
dismiss them because of her
psychological issues is...

23:34.021 --> 23:36.763
They're not psychological.

23:36.806 --> 23:38.634
- Hey!

23:39.461 --> 23:40.941
- So I would like to start

23:40.984 --> 23:42.986
by saying thank you both
for being here.

23:43.030 --> 23:44.771
- I'm just here 'cause
Warden said I had to.

23:44.814 --> 23:46.294
- I'm just here
'cause the door is locked.

23:46.337 --> 23:48.165
- I know, I know.

23:48.209 --> 23:50.298
Just when you thought nothing
could get worse than jail,

23:50.341 --> 23:52.387
along comes
couples therapy, right?

23:52.431 --> 23:54.128
I'll make this quick.

23:54.171 --> 23:55.956
There are issues from your past

23:55.999 --> 23:59.133
that are impacting
your ability to get along

23:59.176 --> 24:00.917
in the present, right?

24:00.961 --> 24:03.180
So I would like to help
you navigate those issues.

24:03.224 --> 24:05.792
- Issue is she
needs to obey me.

24:05.835 --> 24:08.185
Our past ain't got
nothing to do with it.

24:08.229 --> 24:10.753
- So why did you
stop being friends?

24:10.797 --> 24:12.712
- She drifted
into a bad way of life.

24:12.755 --> 24:14.844
- Girl, I'm in here
on a misdemeanor.

24:14.888 --> 24:17.978
You talking like
I'm Pablo Escobar.

24:18.021 --> 24:19.806
- Okay, Pablo,
then why don't you tell me--

24:19.849 --> 24:21.155
why do you think
you two fell out?

24:21.198 --> 24:22.461
- I don't know.

24:22.504 --> 24:24.854
She wouldn't tell me,
even though I asked.

24:24.898 --> 24:26.987
- You hooked up
with that loser Justin Karn

24:27.030 --> 24:30.425
and never wanted
to do anything ever again.

24:30.469 --> 24:32.296
Don't lie.

24:32.340 --> 24:34.821
- So why did you being
with Justin mean that

24:34.864 --> 24:37.824
you couldn't spend
your time with Sanchez?

24:44.483 --> 24:46.920
- You know how it is.

24:48.835 --> 24:53.404
If I spent time with
my friends without him, he'd...

24:53.448 --> 24:55.015
hit me or whatever.

24:58.714 --> 25:01.282
- I didn't know that.

25:05.721 --> 25:08.463
- So, when you get
an infraction in here,

25:08.507 --> 25:10.770
does that feel similar?

25:10.813 --> 25:12.859
- Like I'm right back there.
- Right.

25:12.902 --> 25:15.035
- So what, then,
that's on me?

25:15.078 --> 25:16.732
- No, nobody's saying that.

25:16.776 --> 25:18.908
- Good, 'cause
I didn't put you in jail.

25:18.952 --> 25:20.257
I'm just doing my job.

25:20.301 --> 25:22.346
- Right, and like you told me,

25:22.390 --> 25:24.958
if you don't do your job,
the guys see it.

25:25.001 --> 25:26.699
- Damn right.

25:26.742 --> 25:30.137
- Right, so you both
have been controlled by men.

25:32.356 --> 25:35.751
- Look, I need this job.
I got kids.

25:38.101 --> 25:40.103
- You got kids?

25:40.147 --> 25:42.149
- Hector and Ruby.

25:45.500 --> 25:48.198
- Ruby like your tía.

25:48.242 --> 25:50.418
- You remember her?

25:53.290 --> 25:57.077
Look, I can't be talking
about this with you, chica.

25:57.120 --> 25:59.383
I'm a CO, you're an inmate.

25:59.427 --> 26:01.255
That's all we can be.

26:02.430 --> 26:04.040
- That's true.

26:04.084 --> 26:06.434
You--you can't be friends
while you're in here,

26:06.477 --> 26:09.263
but you can look
at each other...

26:09.306 --> 26:11.265
just for a second

26:11.308 --> 26:13.441
and remember that
there's more to who you are.

26:45.995 --> 26:49.477
- I told y'all to go.

26:49.520 --> 26:51.522
Charly, just look at me.
- Dr. Goodwin.

26:51.566 --> 26:53.046
- I'm good, I'm good.

26:53.089 --> 26:54.787
Dr. Sharpe, can you
stand in the doorway

26:54.830 --> 26:56.963
and hold up your hand, please?

26:57.006 --> 26:58.442
- Take five steps back,
little man.

26:58.486 --> 26:59.966
- Just look at me.

27:00.009 --> 27:03.186
Focus on my eyes
and don't turn your head.

27:03.230 --> 27:04.535
Just stay with me.

27:04.579 --> 27:06.189
- I don't want to look
in your dumb-ass eyes.

27:06.233 --> 27:07.451
Why would I look at you?

27:07.495 --> 27:10.019
- Because you
can't see the walls.

27:12.108 --> 27:15.198
Right? How many fingers
is she holding up?

27:15.242 --> 27:17.897
Without looking--
can you tell me?

27:19.333 --> 27:21.161
You're having
peripheral-vision problems.

27:21.204 --> 27:23.163
They probably started around
the same time as your hair loss

27:23.206 --> 27:25.382
and your leg weakness--
maybe neck pain, too.

27:25.426 --> 27:27.820
We think you have
a brain tumor

27:27.863 --> 27:29.386
and it's pressing
on your optic nerve,

27:29.430 --> 27:31.998
and that is what
is causing all of this.

27:32.041 --> 27:34.827
That's why you feel
the way you do.

27:34.870 --> 27:38.178
It's why your emotions
have been so intense,

27:38.221 --> 27:41.094
the behavior that
got you in the SHU...

27:41.137 --> 27:43.183
it's not your fault.

27:47.491 --> 27:51.104
- So I-I'm not...

27:52.932 --> 27:55.369
I'm not...
- You're not crazy.

27:55.412 --> 27:57.588
You're sick.

27:57.632 --> 27:59.416
And we're gonna get you
to New Amsterdam,

27:59.460 --> 28:01.201
and you're gonna get better.

28:04.073 --> 28:05.205
Okay?

28:05.248 --> 28:06.380
Okay.

28:11.690 --> 28:13.909
- You stay strong.

28:13.953 --> 28:16.042
Your surgery was a success.

28:16.085 --> 28:20.046
- So I get to go
back to Rikers.

28:22.309 --> 28:24.398
- In order to confirm
that Ms. Randle's embolism

28:24.441 --> 28:25.921
is fully cleared,

28:25.965 --> 28:28.184
I need to perform
a radionuclide scan.

28:28.228 --> 28:30.186
It emits a great
deal of radiation.

28:30.230 --> 28:31.448
- And?

28:31.492 --> 28:33.146
- I suggest
you stay out here,

28:33.189 --> 28:35.191
unless you prefer
not to have children.

28:44.940 --> 28:46.333
Got to be quiet.

28:46.376 --> 28:48.901
- Darrell!
- Shh.

28:48.944 --> 28:51.077
-  Mom, The doctor
said we have to be quiet.

28:51.120 --> 28:53.732
- Okay.
Come here, babies.

28:56.082 --> 28:58.171
Oh, look at you.

28:58.214 --> 29:00.477
You got so big.
Are you okay?

29:02.001 --> 29:04.655
Look at you.

29:07.702 --> 29:10.052
- I forgot how nice
it is to have you so close

29:10.096 --> 29:11.967
that I can stop by
just to steal a kiss.

29:12.011 --> 29:14.665
- Can't steal
what I want to give.

29:14.709 --> 29:17.494
- Come here, you.

29:17.538 --> 29:18.582
Mwah.

29:18.626 --> 29:19.975
Hey, about this morning,

29:20.019 --> 29:21.237
I know I need
to give you some space.

29:21.281 --> 29:22.717
- Don't even.
We're all good.

29:22.761 --> 29:25.154
- I'm just really excited
that you're home.

29:25.198 --> 29:27.678
So, sorry for
misplacing my chill.

29:32.248 --> 29:33.946
- San Francisco Memorial

29:33.989 --> 29:36.513
offered me
a full-time position...

29:36.557 --> 29:39.473
- Hmm.
- As Head Legal Counsel.

29:39.516 --> 29:41.431
I didn't know how to tell you.

29:41.475 --> 29:43.520
And I'm so sorry to drop
this on you in the middle

29:43.564 --> 29:45.392
of the day,
but I-I love you...

29:45.435 --> 29:47.133
- Well, what did you tell them?

29:50.179 --> 29:52.007
- I said I'd consider it.

29:55.184 --> 29:56.795
- Get off of me!
- Excuse me.

29:56.838 --> 29:58.492
Excuse me.
What happened?

29:58.535 --> 30:00.015
Where are you hurt?
- Blood's not mine.

30:00.059 --> 30:01.364
I just got
knocked against the wall.

30:01.408 --> 30:03.584
- Go, go.
- Stay back.

30:03.627 --> 30:06.630
- Tell me what happened.

30:12.767 --> 30:16.771
- Four injured!
We need the medics.

30:16.815 --> 30:18.817
- She's got three deep lacs.

30:18.860 --> 30:20.340
- I need two ambulances--

30:20.383 --> 30:22.081
four inmates,
multiple lacerations.

30:22.124 --> 30:23.299
Get 'em to New Amsterdam.

30:26.172 --> 30:28.348
- How's she doing?

30:28.391 --> 30:30.524
- To be honest,
Dr. Ligon, not great.

30:30.567 --> 30:32.439
She's exhibiting
drug-seeking behavior.

30:32.482 --> 30:33.788
She was just trying to lie
to me about losing a pill.

30:33.832 --> 30:35.050
I mean, I knew that Bloom

30:35.094 --> 30:37.531
had a bit of a reputation,
but this was--

30:37.574 --> 30:40.926
She was screaming at me.
- You mean Dr. Bloom?

30:40.969 --> 30:43.363
- Yes, I-I didn't mean
any offense.

30:43.406 --> 30:45.017
- Dr. Bloom is
one of the finest doctors

30:45.060 --> 30:47.019
I've ever worked with,
and I trust that

30:47.062 --> 30:49.543
you're not one to put stock
into petty rumors.

30:49.586 --> 30:51.023
- No, of course not...

30:51.066 --> 30:53.025
- If Dr. Bloom said
that the pill got lost,

30:53.068 --> 30:55.636
then the pill got lost,
understand?

30:55.679 --> 30:57.725
- Yes, Doctor.

30:59.945 --> 31:03.426
- Hey, how you feeling?

31:05.951 --> 31:08.562
- Thank you...

31:08.605 --> 31:11.043
for what you said.

31:11.086 --> 31:13.654
- Oh, you heard that.

31:16.135 --> 31:18.702
- I looked everywhere for it.

31:18.746 --> 31:22.402
I mean, I seriously thought
that I was going crazy.

31:22.445 --> 31:24.186
I mean, at one point...

31:24.230 --> 31:26.058
I thought
that I must've taken it

31:26.101 --> 31:29.975
and then forgotten
that I'd taken it.

31:30.018 --> 31:33.108
But I know in my heart...

31:33.152 --> 31:35.545
I didn't do it.

31:37.808 --> 31:39.941
And you believe me?

31:39.985 --> 31:42.770
- Well, let's not write
a sonnet about it, shall we?

31:54.651 --> 31:56.479
- Why do you believe me?

31:59.656 --> 32:01.963
- Why?

32:02.007 --> 32:05.140
- You've got no reason to.

32:05.184 --> 32:07.012
- I don't follow.

32:09.623 --> 32:12.495
- As one addict to another...

32:13.975 --> 32:16.630
The only way
that you could be...

32:19.502 --> 32:22.549
Certain that
I didn't take it...

32:24.855 --> 32:26.205
Is if you did.

32:29.730 --> 32:31.819
- Addicts do two things.

32:31.862 --> 32:36.215
Get high and blame other
people for their mistakes.

32:37.868 --> 32:40.567
You're doing the latter...

32:40.610 --> 32:43.613
or is this both at once?

32:58.672 --> 33:00.152
- Yes?

33:00.195 --> 33:03.024
Ella, I want to offer you

33:03.068 --> 33:05.679
support I learned
from the blogs I found.

33:05.722 --> 33:07.159
- You read blogs?

33:07.202 --> 33:09.204
- About how to be
a helpful grandparent.

33:09.248 --> 33:11.076
Have you heard
of "meal trains"?

33:11.119 --> 33:12.729
Perhaps I can conduct one.

33:12.773 --> 33:14.253
- Uh, Vijay...

33:16.081 --> 33:17.865
- What is it?

33:23.088 --> 33:25.829
- I have
obsessive compulsive disorder.

33:25.873 --> 33:29.181
- I understand.

33:29.224 --> 33:32.880
It is not uncommon
for pregnancy to cause OCD.

33:32.923 --> 33:34.882
- Right, uh...

33:34.925 --> 33:37.058
but this is not
from the pregnancy.

33:37.102 --> 33:40.235
- Okay, so
when was it diagnosed?

33:40.279 --> 33:43.195
- About 12 years ago...

33:43.238 --> 33:45.806
uh, after I was hospitalized.

33:49.897 --> 33:53.205
Uh, they put me on high doses
of Zoloft and Trazodone,

33:53.248 --> 33:56.208
but now I'm pregnant,
so no more meds.

33:56.251 --> 33:58.819
I've been talking
with Dr. Frome,

33:58.862 --> 34:00.734
'cause I don't...

34:00.777 --> 34:02.823
I don't know
if I can do this.

34:06.609 --> 34:09.656
- You will make
a wonderful mother.

34:11.266 --> 34:13.616
- But in order
to be a wonderful mom,

34:13.660 --> 34:15.575
I have to put this kid first.

34:15.618 --> 34:18.230
And so I made a plan

34:18.273 --> 34:21.798
to make sure that
I can manage my OCD.

34:21.842 --> 34:25.846
And I'm gonna move
back in with my parents.

34:25.889 --> 34:28.153
- That sounds very wise.

34:30.633 --> 34:32.026
- In Idaho.

34:35.725 --> 34:38.598
I-Idaho.

34:38.641 --> 34:41.166
- Mm-hmm.

34:50.000 --> 34:51.785
Mm.

34:51.828 --> 34:54.092
- Rough day?

34:54.135 --> 34:57.965
- Just...tell me.

34:59.662 --> 35:01.795
Is it getting worse?

35:05.799 --> 35:09.150
- See the lack
of signal right here?

35:13.372 --> 35:15.156
Tumor's gone.

35:16.766 --> 35:18.333
- But my--my throat.
I was--

35:18.377 --> 35:20.248
- Allergies.

35:21.858 --> 35:24.034
Max...

35:25.993 --> 35:29.997
You're in remission.

35:40.007 --> 35:42.662
- Hey.
- Hi.

35:42.705 --> 35:44.316
I just heard
that Jackie's stable.

35:44.359 --> 35:45.882
That's great news.

35:45.926 --> 35:47.101
- Yeah, all four of them are.

35:47.145 --> 35:48.798
How'd you leave it
with the warden?

35:48.842 --> 35:51.671
-  This was not his
favorite day at the office,

35:51.714 --> 35:53.020
but he surprised me.

35:53.063 --> 35:55.022
- Yeah, in that he didn't
stab you as well?

35:55.065 --> 35:57.024
In that he...

35:57.067 --> 36:00.201
has asked us to go back.

36:00.245 --> 36:03.726
The warden is a results guy,
and he liked our results,

36:03.770 --> 36:05.685
so I suggested
that Rikers become part

36:05.728 --> 36:07.208
of our med school rotation.

36:07.252 --> 36:08.688
We could send students over

36:08.731 --> 36:10.820
during OB/GYN
and Behavioral Health...

36:10.864 --> 36:13.214
and he's requesting extra
COs to ensure their safety.

36:13.258 --> 36:16.043
- That's great--
that's great work.

36:16.086 --> 36:19.438
-  I thought
you'd be more pleased.

36:19.481 --> 36:21.875
- No, I am, I am.
It's--

36:21.918 --> 36:25.487
Sorry.

36:25.531 --> 36:28.229
- I have to go.

36:28.273 --> 36:30.275
- Are you okay?

36:39.762 --> 36:41.938
- I'll burden you
if you burden me.

36:46.987 --> 36:49.381
I'm in remission.

36:49.424 --> 36:52.253
My God.

36:52.297 --> 36:53.950
- Yeah.

36:53.994 --> 36:56.257
- Max, that is wonderful.

36:59.478 --> 37:02.481
So...so why isn't it?

37:04.134 --> 37:06.267
- ♪ My soul, I...

38:08.242 --> 38:10.940

38:13.900 --> 38:15.597
But you don't even
get to know that.

38:15.641 --> 38:18.470

38:18.513 --> 38:20.341
Luna.

38:20.385 --> 38:23.344
- I met her.

38:23.388 --> 38:25.172
I got to hold her.

38:25.215 --> 38:27.348
It's not enough.

38:27.392 --> 38:30.003
- No.

38:30.046 --> 38:33.833
But it's what we have.

38:33.876 --> 38:37.489
And nothing you do
can change it.

38:37.532 --> 38:41.841
Nothing you do
will bring me back.

38:46.541 --> 38:49.501
You just have

- The board has

40:10.408 --> 40:12.148
- Good.

40:12.192 --> 40:13.976
Let's discuss,
and then I'd like

40:14.020 --> 40:15.978
to share some plans
from today's visit to Rikers.

40:16.022 --> 40:18.590
- Those plans are
no longer yours to make.

40:20.418 --> 40:22.724
- Effective immediately,
you are stripped of your title

40:22.768 --> 40:24.683
as Co-Chair of Oncology,

40:24.726 --> 40:28.034
as well as your duties
as Deputy Medical Director.

40:52.232 --> 40:54.103
- Huh? What?
- Fran, I'm Dr. Jessup.

40:54.147 --> 40:56.062
- What's going on?
Where am I?

40:56.105 --> 40:57.542
- You're in
New Amsterdam Hospital.

40:57.585 --> 40:59.195
You're here from Rikers.

40:59.239 --> 41:00.632
You overdosed,
and it damaged your heart.

41:00.675 --> 41:03.243
- No, that--that's not right.
You need to stop.

41:03.286 --> 41:04.636
I-I need to get out of here.

41:04.679 --> 41:06.072
- You're okay.
You're through the worst.

41:06.115 --> 41:07.508
- I don't do drugs ever.

41:07.552 --> 41:09.554
This is because
I turned state's witness.

41:09.597 --> 41:11.556
Someone's trying to kill me.

41:11.599 --> 41:13.383
- It's okay.
- No.

41:13.427 --> 41:14.515
- You're safe here.

41:14.559 --> 41:16.125
- No, please, get me
out of here.

41:16.169 --> 41:17.997
Get me out of here.
Someone's trying to kill me.

41:18.040 --> 41:21.217
Please. Please.

41:21.261 --> 41:24.090
- Can you buzz us in?
I can't find my ID.

41:34.143 --> 41:36.537
- Hey, Officer.

42:08.090 --> 42:10.049
- 45-year-old man--

42:10.092 --> 42:11.311
acute onset tearing chest pain.

42:11.354 --> 42:14.053
Heart rate 110.
140 over 56--

42:14.096 --> 42:16.142
- Guard?
