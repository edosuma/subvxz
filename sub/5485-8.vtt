00:00.040 --> 00:01.774
<i>Previously on
The Bastard Executioner...</¡></i>

00:01.777 --> 00:03.678
My name is Wilkin Brattle.

00:03.713 --> 00:05.912
<i>I was a knight</i>
<i>in Longshanks' army.</i>

00:05.947 --> 00:07.080
<i>Gawain Maddox was</i>
<i>an executioner killed</i>

00:07.115 --> 00:09.082
<i>in service to your husband.</i>

00:09.117 --> 00:13.254
<i>I took the punisher's identity</i>
<i>to save myself and my friends.</i>

00:13.288 --> 00:15.088
I'm sorry I lied to you,
Lady Love.

00:15.123 --> 00:18.359
Why is it that you bring
these men to my chapel?

00:18.393 --> 00:21.795
<i>- What is it that demands such secrecy?</i>
<i>ABSOLON: - Not your concern.</i>

00:21.829 --> 00:23.664
BERBER: <i>He had us stripped</i>
<i>from neck to waist,</i>

00:23.698 --> 00:25.831
looking for heretical markings.

00:25.866 --> 00:27.500
FATHER RUSKIN: Did the archdeacon
say what they looked like?

00:27.534 --> 00:29.335
- You have seen such markings.
- Yes.

00:29.370 --> 00:32.372
BERBER:
<i>The healer in the Far Caverns.</i>

00:35.876 --> 00:38.645
You think he spins a tale
to save himself from servitude?

00:38.679 --> 00:40.813
ROBINUS: <i>We will see</i>
<i>what becomes of it</i>

00:40.847 --> 00:43.849
<i>on our way out of this</i>
<i>godless, damp hole.</i>

00:46.687 --> 00:47.887
My needs here will grow.

00:47.921 --> 00:49.388
I'm depending on you.

00:49.422 --> 00:52.591
A brother could not ask
for more generous sisters.

00:52.625 --> 00:54.593
Half-sisters.

00:54.627 --> 00:57.797
LEON: <i>The rebel threat is</i>
<i>to be crushed by any method.</i>

00:57.831 --> 00:59.531
These people are nomads,
not rebels.

01:05.871 --> 01:07.505
CORBETT:
Sir Norton.

01:07.539 --> 01:08.973
He is my offering.

01:09.008 --> 01:10.975
Torture him. Kill him.

01:11.010 --> 01:13.812
<i>You wrath will not touch</i>
<i>our reeve</i>

01:13.846 --> 01:15.479
<i>or any of his other men.</i>

01:15.514 --> 01:17.315
<i>You are well aware</i>
<i>of the consequences,</i>

01:17.349 --> 01:19.184
<i>if you turn against that.</i>

01:19.218 --> 01:20.985
Our chamberlain will think
this was our brutal blade.

01:21.020 --> 01:22.520
- The reeve...
WILKIN: - Leon didn't see it.

01:22.554 --> 01:25.223
Corbett will only see betrayal.

01:31.062 --> 01:33.063
(Pippa fussing)

01:40.305 --> 01:42.306
(Pippa quiets)

01:47.745 --> 01:49.213
Thank you.

01:49.247 --> 01:53.583
Devotion requires
no thanks, my husband.

You have not given to a mood
or spirit of joy

02:14.572 --> 02:16.405
since we laid together.

02:18.108 --> 02:21.244
Did... I give pleasure?

02:23.080 --> 02:24.280
Yes.

02:26.316 --> 02:28.317
I was most satisfied.

02:34.024 --> 02:35.858
(door closes)

02:53.376 --> 02:55.176
CLERIC: Pater noster...

02:55.211 --> 02:58.847
qui est in coelis.

02:58.882 --> 03:02.450
<i>Sanctificter nomen tuum.</i>

03:02.484 --> 03:06.020
<i>Adveniat regnum tuum.</i>

03:06.054 --> 03:09.924
<i>Fiat voluntas tua...</i>

03:09.958 --> 03:12.693
<i>sicat in coelo et en terra.</i>

03:12.728 --> 03:15.797
<i>Panem nostrum quotidianum</i>

03:15.831 --> 03:18.998
<i>da nobis hodie.</i>

03:19.033 --> 03:21.535
<i>Et dimitte nobis.</i>

03:25.306 --> 03:27.307
Is that not layered
too thick?

03:27.341 --> 03:28.942
I do not want
the earl to think

03:28.976 --> 03:31.277
I swallowed a lamb
shank in my sleep.

03:31.312 --> 03:34.280
I must use twice the padding
as last week, my lady.

03:34.315 --> 03:36.483
With your ever-shrinking
waistline,

03:36.517 --> 03:39.486
that stuffing went
utterly undetected.

03:39.520 --> 03:42.721
You are supposed to be
two, three months?

03:42.756 --> 03:44.424
Three blessed months.

03:45.960 --> 03:47.827
(sighs)
The Earl of Warwick's urgent visit

03:47.861 --> 03:51.030
may yet bring more
progeny scrutiny from Windsor.

03:54.901 --> 03:56.735
As I am devoted to you,

03:56.770 --> 03:58.938
and all the truths
you hold close, my lady,

03:58.973 --> 04:03.209
I must ask-- in light of this
growing royal scrutiny...

04:05.378 --> 04:08.213
is there anything I need
to know about our punisher?

04:09.816 --> 04:12.685
You and Master Gawain
spend accountable time

04:12.719 --> 04:14.520
in each other's
company, Baroness.

04:14.554 --> 04:16.355
I just want to be...

04:16.389 --> 04:18.023
To be what, maiden?

04:20.392 --> 04:21.994
Oh, do not give
feigned deference

04:22.028 --> 04:23.228
when your boldness
already fills the room.

04:23.262 --> 04:25.197
Speak!

04:25.231 --> 04:27.700
There is nothing I can speak
you do not already know, Love.

04:27.734 --> 04:30.202
You are of royal,
noble blood.

04:30.236 --> 04:32.236
Master Gawain is a common man
who holds a brutish trade.

04:32.270 --> 04:35.507
- Any suspicion of...
- Suspicion is fear without truth.

04:35.541 --> 04:38.409
ISABEL: That turns to poisonous talk
and spreads like fire on hot oil!

04:43.115 --> 04:44.782
I am sorry, Baroness.

04:44.817 --> 04:47.619
And, yes, I am aware that
my deep affection for you

04:47.653 --> 04:50.054
continues to push me beyond
reasonable behavior.

04:50.088 --> 04:52.924
But I fear if I say nothing,
nothing will be said...

04:52.958 --> 04:54.392
until it is too late.

04:54.426 --> 04:56.260
Leave me.

05:00.364 --> 05:02.198

07:12.411 --> 07:15.579
Your stubborn king finally
put quill to parchment.

07:15.613 --> 07:17.748
Honored his promise
to the Ordainers.

07:17.782 --> 07:19.616
"Having led
the king astray,

07:19.651 --> 07:22.053
and persuaded him
to do evil,

07:22.087 --> 07:25.189
Piers Gaveston shall be
cast out and exiled."

07:25.223 --> 07:26.457
And it is my mission

07:26.491 --> 07:28.725
for both God and country
to make certain

07:28.760 --> 07:31.627
that his third banishment
be his last.

07:47.078 --> 07:49.379
BERBER:
He is with his brother now.

07:49.413 --> 07:53.915
Guilt of that death
never settled well for him.

07:53.949 --> 07:57.744
I'd wager Calo and Aron have already
beat the piss out of each other.

07:57.901 --> 08:03.290
Yea. Fighting over
the last bowl of stew.

08:08.096 --> 08:10.131
I'm sorry, brothers.

08:12.034 --> 08:15.302
I never thought my deception
here would turn this way,

08:15.337 --> 08:18.672
bring this much suffering.

08:18.706 --> 08:21.409
We were all a part of it, Wilk.

08:21.443 --> 08:25.279
You have done nothing
in need of contrition, brother.

08:35.090 --> 08:38.890
Give your eyes and mind
some rest, good priest.

08:38.926 --> 08:41.160
I read it three times.

08:41.195 --> 08:43.763
Each time brings a need
to read it yet again.

08:46.867 --> 08:49.202
You may ask your questions now.

08:50.871 --> 08:52.572
Are there more?

08:52.606 --> 08:54.407
There are nine scriptures.

08:54.442 --> 08:58.111
All of them are hand-scribed
by the Nazarene?

08:58.145 --> 09:01.247
Yes.

09:01.282 --> 09:04.984
Jesus... son of Joseph.

09:06.686 --> 09:09.654
One testament, one author.

09:10.856 --> 09:13.459
If these are truly his words,

09:13.493 --> 09:15.561
the very foundation
of all that I believe

09:15.595 --> 09:16.795
and all that I preach...

09:16.829 --> 09:18.263
Is shattered.

09:20.700 --> 09:23.702
That is why Robinus
and his army pursue us.

09:25.705 --> 09:28.507
We are the seraphim...

09:28.541 --> 09:32.711
the ones chosen
to carry and protect

09:32.745 --> 09:34.479
the words of the Nazarene.

09:34.513 --> 09:35.880
Protect?

09:35.915 --> 09:37.749
From the Church?

09:37.783 --> 09:41.586
They are called
Socijs Rosula.

09:41.621 --> 09:43.354
"Knights of the Rosebud."

09:43.388 --> 09:47.692
Descendants of
the very soldiers who whipped,

09:47.727 --> 09:51.863
tortured and lay a crown
of locust thorns

09:51.897 --> 09:55.066
on the head of the one
they mocked as King of the Jews.

09:57.103 --> 09:58.770
The Rosula believe

09:58.804 --> 10:02.874
Jesus rose from the dead,
walked out of his tomb,

10:02.908 --> 10:06.877
and when faced with
these same soldiers,

10:06.911 --> 10:08.879
he pardoned their sins,

10:08.913 --> 10:12.116
and appointed them keepers
of his sacred history,

10:12.150 --> 10:15.753
granting them
divine impunity,

10:15.787 --> 10:18.822
and the power of
the Church to destroy

10:18.857 --> 10:21.458
anything or anyone

10:21.492 --> 10:24.427
that might prove
a threat to that story.

10:24.462 --> 10:28.666
The danger that is found
in these pages...

10:28.700 --> 10:31.802
What will Robinus and his
knights do if they capture you?

10:38.142 --> 10:41.378
Bring them all
to their knees, stripped.

10:41.412 --> 10:43.980
Only the seraphim lives.

10:57.795 --> 11:00.663
I do not understand the purpose
I serve in all of this, woman.

11:00.698 --> 11:02.965
I'm but a manor priest,

11:03.000 --> 11:05.735
not a scholar or a prophet.

11:10.040 --> 11:13.976
We do not need a scholar

11:14.011 --> 11:16.312
or a prophet.

11:16.346 --> 11:18.981
We need a warrior.

11:34.631 --> 11:36.632
♪

11:51.213 --> 11:52.213

12:20.108 --> 12:22.476

12:44.932 --> 12:47.301

12:54.609 --> 12:56.543
Templar traps.

12:58.313 --> 13:00.146
KNIGHT:
There's a letter.

13:02.583 --> 13:03.983
ABSOLON:
No!

13:04.485 --> 13:05.485

13:10.357 --> 13:14.127
(men screaming)

13:16.197 --> 13:18.198

13:42.656 --> 13:44.590
Devils.

13:45.892 --> 13:47.859
(seagulls screeching,
waves crashing)

13:51.029 --> 13:53.998
Is there anything else you
wish me to tell our punisher?

13:54.032 --> 13:57.802
No. Only where we
can now be found.

13:59.372 --> 14:02.173
This bond that
you have to Maddox...

14:02.207 --> 14:05.209
Is between the
executioner and myself.

14:18.924 --> 14:22.927
The Rosula, they know
the priest came to us.

14:24.763 --> 14:26.597
And now they will
come for him.

14:28.100 --> 14:30.067
Yes.

14:30.102 --> 14:32.069
His next test of faith.

14:32.104 --> 14:34.105
Yeah.

14:42.873 --> 14:46.473
Edward's utter disregard
for sound counsel

14:46.474 --> 14:48.875
pushes England
to the brink of civil war.

14:48.910 --> 14:51.278
Our loyalties are twisted,
our power is diminished,

14:51.313 --> 14:54.581
and our finances... apocalyptic.

14:54.615 --> 14:57.651
CORBETT:
So in order to prevent doom

14:57.685 --> 15:00.620
and insolvency, you and
the Ordainers have seized

15:00.655 --> 15:03.590
the strings of our king's
frivolous purse.

15:03.624 --> 15:05.224
We return stability

15:05.259 --> 15:07.494
by giving the rights
of disbursement to Parliament.

15:07.528 --> 15:10.864
Influential barons
forcing the hand of the king.

15:10.898 --> 15:14.133
Are not you the ones pushing us
to the brink of civil war?

15:14.168 --> 15:16.670
We are aware
that this strong stance

15:16.704 --> 15:18.137
may lead to greater conflict.

15:18.172 --> 15:21.842
BEAUCHAMP:
Edward may try to amass forces.

15:21.876 --> 15:23.844
But without his conspirators
and bottomless coffers,

15:23.878 --> 15:25.679
he will never gather an army

15:25.713 --> 15:28.147
that can best
our combined efforts.

15:30.049 --> 15:33.652
May we assume you are here
to gather more combined efforts?

15:33.687 --> 15:36.321
RUSSO: That is one
of the very reasons

15:36.356 --> 15:37.656
we travel here this day.

15:37.691 --> 15:40.359
The Ordainers would like
to offer Ventrishire

15:40.393 --> 15:43.195
a seat at our
concerted table.

15:43.229 --> 15:46.231
You provide us with your
formidable military support

15:46.265 --> 15:48.433
and access to the sea.

15:48.468 --> 15:53.038
In return, we make certain
that Parliament never divides

15:53.072 --> 15:56.876
or bestows Ventrishire
to another.

15:56.910 --> 16:01.779
That is an offer that provokes
heart, mind and purse, my lord.

16:01.814 --> 16:05.717
This might provoke something
completely different.

16:05.751 --> 16:09.787
The other reason the honorable
Earl of Warwick comes to call.

16:09.822 --> 16:13.224
Part of the accordance
with our king

16:13.258 --> 16:16.628
was a decree banishing
Piers Gaveston.

16:16.662 --> 16:18.930
BEAUCHAMP: The king
can no longer deny

16:18.964 --> 16:20.097
the hatred Gaveston stirred.

16:20.132 --> 16:22.901
They both knew
another exile was due.

16:22.935 --> 16:25.770
Edward agreed
to let Gaveston

16:25.804 --> 16:28.406
- seek refuge in Wales.
CORBETT: - Ah!

16:28.440 --> 16:31.408
Near the sea, so they can
sail into each other's arms.

16:31.442 --> 16:34.177
(chuckles)
With this, there will be no sailing.

16:34.211 --> 16:39.016
"Piers Gaveston shall be
cast out and exiled

16:39.050 --> 16:43.620
not only from England, but
from Wales, Scotland, Ireland

16:43.655 --> 16:46.523
forever and without return."

16:46.558 --> 16:48.959
BEAUCHAMP: We made certain there
was no rock in all of England

16:48.993 --> 16:50.360
under which he could crawl.

16:50.394 --> 16:51.995
And yet he escaped you.

16:52.030 --> 16:54.865
RUSSO:
Without money and sway,

16:54.899 --> 16:58.368
Gaveston will have
no allies nor sanctuary.

16:58.402 --> 16:59.736
Whatever hole he crawls into,

16:59.771 --> 17:02.105
you can be certain
he will not be welcome.

17:02.139 --> 17:05.174
BEAUCHAMP: If you have any knowledge
of where that hole might be

17:05.208 --> 17:08.010
and who allows him
to hide in it,

17:08.045 --> 17:10.012
we would be most grateful.

17:10.047 --> 17:12.848
And...

17:12.883 --> 17:15.250
most generous.

17:21.058 --> 17:24.026
Our reward...
if the information

17:24.060 --> 17:26.662
brings us the capture
of Piers Gaveston.

17:26.696 --> 17:28.965
Indeed.

17:28.999 --> 17:31.433
Most generous, my lord.

17:34.203 --> 17:37.438
If we could do more
than share knowledge,

17:37.473 --> 17:39.741
if my men could
deliver Gaveston,

17:39.775 --> 17:43.344
a tidy French package
dropped at your feet,

17:43.378 --> 17:47.949
might that beg a favor
along with compensation?

17:51.320 --> 17:54.122
For what favor
do you beg, Baroness?

17:54.156 --> 17:58.559
As you are well aware, Wales
suffers its own civil upheaval.

17:58.594 --> 18:01.997
The Byth Encil rebels grow
more bold in their attacks

18:02.031 --> 18:05.600
as we grow more brutal
in our suppression.

18:05.635 --> 18:08.702
This blood-for-blood serves
neither God nor country.

18:11.139 --> 18:13.573
There will be no one at
your table better versed

18:13.608 --> 18:16.309
in the complexities of
this issue than myself.

18:16.344 --> 18:20.280
Give me the authority to handle
the rebellion as I see fit.

18:20.314 --> 18:22.449
If I cannot
restore harmony

18:22.483 --> 18:24.852
and reduce the financial
drain on England,

18:24.886 --> 18:27.888
I shall relinquish control.

18:29.958 --> 18:31.892
That is your favor?

18:31.926 --> 18:33.861
To entreat with the barbarians?

18:37.766 --> 18:40.733
We will most gladly
give you the weight

18:40.768 --> 18:43.002
of your yellow-painted
rebellion, Baroness.

18:43.037 --> 18:45.004
Splendid.

18:45.039 --> 18:49.008
Then we shall begin our hunt
for the Frenchman most wanted.

18:49.043 --> 18:51.110
And most loathed.

19:02.890 --> 19:03.890
(whispers)

19:10.163 --> 19:12.363
Our watcher knows
what he must do.

19:12.398 --> 19:15.167
- Shall I have him begin in the village?
- Yes.

19:15.201 --> 19:18.636
He should look for the priest as
well as any male child he tends.

19:18.671 --> 19:20.172
A child?

19:20.206 --> 19:22.674
- Of what age?
- I do not know.

19:22.709 --> 19:24.142
But he would have
been cared for

19:24.177 --> 19:25.811
by the gray woman
or the Templar.

19:25.845 --> 19:29.180
I will send an
emissary to Avignon,

19:29.214 --> 19:31.648
letting His Holiness know
that my need for reflection

19:31.683 --> 19:34.651
takes me to Basingwerk Abbey.

19:34.686 --> 19:38.689
When Sir Cormac returns,
have him join me there.

19:38.724 --> 19:40.157
Yes, master.

19:57.441 --> 20:00.443
WILKIN: The curve of the "C"
points the other way.

20:02.446 --> 20:03.880
Good.

20:03.914 --> 20:05.414
You'll be schooling us
soon, Sir Luca.

20:05.449 --> 20:06.816
LUCA:
Never.

20:06.851 --> 20:08.818
You are the smartest
men I've ever known.

20:08.853 --> 20:11.053
Clearly you have not
known many.

20:11.087 --> 20:12.755
(laughs)

20:12.789 --> 20:14.423
FATHER RUSKIN:
Gentlemen.

20:14.458 --> 20:16.592
Our good priest returns.

20:16.627 --> 20:17.660
WILKIN:
Yea.

20:19.129 --> 20:20.929
You were sorely
missed, Father.

20:20.964 --> 20:24.333
An unexpected journey
to a friend we both know.

20:24.368 --> 20:27.336
Annora.

20:27.371 --> 20:30.306
What turn of fate took
you to the healer?

20:30.340 --> 20:34.510
One I still cannot
quite comprehend.

20:34.544 --> 20:36.779
But I come with a message.

20:36.813 --> 20:39.114
She has left her cave.

20:39.149 --> 20:40.949
They now settle
in the coves

20:40.984 --> 20:42.384
near the Eastern Bay.

20:42.418 --> 20:43.786
WILKIN:
Had to leave, why?

20:43.820 --> 20:45.087
Were they forced out?

20:46.923 --> 20:48.556
Questions best answered by her.

20:55.464 --> 20:57.866
Perhaps you can finish
the boy's lesson.

20:57.901 --> 20:59.501
See that he returns

20:59.535 --> 21:00.669
to his mother.

21:00.703 --> 21:02.337
Of course.

21:07.176 --> 21:09.743
Be good, lad.

21:12.147 --> 21:13.915
(door closes)

21:17.385 --> 21:19.821
Thank you, Baroness.

21:21.857 --> 21:23.257
Chamberlain.

21:23.292 --> 21:25.259
Thank you, sir.

21:28.362 --> 21:31.497
Perhaps if Erik allowed you
a seat at his negotiating table,

21:31.532 --> 21:33.834
he might still be sitting at it.

21:33.868 --> 21:35.836
Uh, do not be impressed,
dear chamberlain.

21:35.870 --> 21:38.872
I have an awful habit of voicing
dreams as if they were truths.

21:40.607 --> 21:42.775
We must find Gaveston.

21:44.578 --> 21:46.779
The money will
ease our strain

21:46.814 --> 21:49.216
and offer us the chance to
take hold of this rebellion.

21:49.250 --> 21:52.152
We cannot let this
opportunity slip away.

21:52.186 --> 21:54.154
Do you really think
you can negotiate

21:54.188 --> 21:56.188
with these rebels
and their Wolf, my lady?

21:56.223 --> 21:59.391
One has to try compromise
before combat.

21:59.425 --> 22:01.393
Only then can I justify
the swing of a sword

22:01.427 --> 22:02.995
as a way to peace.

22:03.029 --> 22:06.999
I will draft letters
to our neighboring shires,

22:07.033 --> 22:10.269
learn if Gaveston has passed
through their gates.

22:10.303 --> 22:13.705
There may also be a source
within our very walls.

22:18.912 --> 22:20.246
(talking quietly)

22:20.280 --> 22:21.413
Yeah. I know it.

22:21.447 --> 22:22.915
I know how
to spell my name.

22:22.949 --> 22:24.583
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

22:30.022 --> 22:32.023
♪

22:37.528 --> 22:40.532
_

22:40.533 --> 22:44.168
These two-- they're from
the raid on our camp.

22:44.203 --> 22:46.203
They come looking
to spill more blood.

22:59.117 --> 23:01.585
It is time for them
to see you as I do.

23:25.109 --> 23:27.944
I understand now the
need for hood and cloth.

23:31.315 --> 23:34.150
What caused your man
to be so brutally burned?

23:34.184 --> 23:36.785
A fire...

23:36.820 --> 23:39.989
set by the very men
he took a sworn oath

23:40.023 --> 23:42.491
to protect and honor.

23:44.994 --> 23:46.962
- You have spoken to the priest?
- Yea.

23:46.996 --> 23:50.631
Why flee the Far Caverns
for this maze of outlaw coves?

23:50.666 --> 23:52.567
TORAN:
Are you in danger?

23:52.601 --> 23:54.602
We are safe here.

23:56.305 --> 24:00.842
I appreciate you traveling
with Wilkin, kind skeptic.

24:00.876 --> 24:05.513
I sense in you a genuine
concern for my welfare.

24:05.547 --> 24:07.548
TORAN:
You sense genuine fear.

24:09.885 --> 24:11.853
That you'll turn me
into a humped troll

24:11.887 --> 24:13.921
with one of your wicked potions.

24:16.492 --> 24:18.493
Come.

24:27.068 --> 24:30.170
We buried our friend Calo
this morning.

24:30.205 --> 24:32.806
Oh, I'm sorry.

24:32.840 --> 24:36.576
He had guilt as
deep as his hunger.

24:36.611 --> 24:40.881
Let us hope he finds
peace on his new journey.

24:40.915 --> 24:43.416
And what of
my journey, woman?

24:43.450 --> 24:46.920
In brutal service
to this court.

24:46.954 --> 24:50.690
My forbidden desire
for this noble lady.

24:50.725 --> 24:54.260
Did you know my fate would
become tied to that castle?

24:55.997 --> 24:59.533
Is this part of the story
you are to help me play out?

24:59.567 --> 25:02.135
I sense one's journey

25:02.169 --> 25:04.970
by what I feel when
I am close to them.

25:05.005 --> 25:08.507
You have this
gift, Wilkin.

25:08.542 --> 25:10.175
(gasps)

25:10.209 --> 25:12.077
- (baby crying)
WOMAN: - Unholy seed...

25:12.111 --> 25:14.279
<i>Mortis hoc bastardus!</i>

25:14.313 --> 25:15.581
(grunts)

25:15.615 --> 25:16.715
WOMAN:
No!

25:16.750 --> 25:18.450
(baby continues crying)

25:25.658 --> 25:27.459
(panting)

25:32.898 --> 25:36.068
I've seen pieces
of that vision before.

25:38.071 --> 25:41.206
I'm the one
in the water.

25:41.240 --> 25:45.642
The nun... and the swordsman.

25:45.677 --> 25:49.313
A desire that was
also forbidden.

25:51.249 --> 25:53.517
The greater one fights

25:53.552 --> 25:56.420
for the love they deserve,

25:56.455 --> 25:59.156
the stronger the bond
between them.

26:01.993 --> 26:03.561
Yea. I'll need a strong bond

26:03.595 --> 26:05.463
to keep my head
attached to my neck,

26:05.497 --> 26:08.899
if I dare take action
on these desires.

26:08.933 --> 26:10.667
The baroness...

26:12.169 --> 26:15.872
she has shared
much truth with you?

26:15.907 --> 26:18.141
Yea.

26:18.175 --> 26:21.979
And I with her.

26:22.013 --> 26:23.947
Far too much.

26:23.982 --> 26:27.684
This feeling that
grows with Lady Love

26:27.719 --> 26:31.221
will only come to light once
there are no more secrets.

26:37.861 --> 26:40.263
You and your mate--

26:40.297 --> 26:42.965
do you give over all your truth?

26:43.000 --> 26:46.869
When you have lived
as long as we have,

26:46.903 --> 26:50.840
the only secrets
you do not share

26:50.874 --> 26:54.776
are the ones you can
no longer remember.

26:54.810 --> 26:56.811
TORAN:
Wilk.

27:02.185 --> 27:03.852
(horse whinnies in distance)

27:16.031 --> 27:18.232
(horse whinnies,
men shouting in distance)

27:21.370 --> 27:23.137
(groaning)

27:27.376 --> 27:29.710
(men continue shouting)

27:34.082 --> 27:35.515
To the cave.

27:39.453 --> 27:43.223
Nomads return to kill us
with an angry swarm.

27:43.257 --> 27:46.060
(yelling)

27:50.031 --> 27:52.099
Go now.

27:52.133 --> 27:54.034
(shouting, grunting)

28:13.221 --> 28:15.421
(groaning)

28:29.636 --> 28:32.038
(shouting, grunting continue)

28:34.473 --> 28:36.808
Get her safe!

28:36.843 --> 28:38.977
You can't take their vengeance
on your own.

28:39.011 --> 28:39.644
Go!

28:42.148 --> 28:43.782
(men shouting in distance)

28:52.125 --> 28:54.126
(horses whinnying,
men continue shouting)

29:02.368 --> 29:04.369
(men laughing)

29:15.813 --> 29:17.814
(yelling, grunting)

29:30.295 --> 29:33.330
(distressed grunting, gasping)

29:38.001 --> 29:39.001
Hurry!

29:55.218 --> 29:56.819
(sighs)

29:58.822 --> 30:01.489
Bury them in the soft sand.

30:04.493 --> 30:06.661
I thought he was without tongue.

30:26.691 --> 30:29.126
On the bed.

30:32.663 --> 30:35.432
We hate it when
our chamberlain goes away.

30:35.466 --> 30:38.802
We took notice of the
English earl here this morning.

30:38.836 --> 30:41.638
Do you travel with him
all the way to Warwick?

30:41.672 --> 30:44.041
Yes.

30:44.075 --> 30:45.876
On the hunt for Gaveston.

30:47.112 --> 30:49.779
That awful Frenchman?

30:49.813 --> 30:51.580
Yes.

30:51.615 --> 30:53.783
Exiled once more.

30:53.817 --> 30:56.585
We have found his hiding hole.

30:56.620 --> 31:00.089
Now the barons ride there

31:00.124 --> 31:02.858
to extract and slaughter.

31:06.763 --> 31:09.498
We will gather the rest
of your traveling things.

31:19.342 --> 31:21.310
(crowd chattering,
chickens clucking)

31:23.146 --> 31:24.847
Are we traveling today,
maidens?

31:26.015 --> 31:28.150
We venture
for the chamberlain.

31:28.184 --> 31:30.820
He's in need of new leather
for his riding boots.

31:32.088 --> 31:33.756
Are these the boots
you speak of?

31:39.929 --> 31:42.163
You carry days
of provisions,

31:42.197 --> 31:44.833
yet the tanner
is but an hour's ride.

31:44.867 --> 31:48.035
Even on old, broken mares.

31:51.173 --> 31:52.874
Do you think
your duplicitous turn

31:52.908 --> 31:55.477
brought me to my knees in vain?

31:57.546 --> 31:59.046
(gasping)

31:59.081 --> 32:02.883
The priest said the punisher
returns after sunset.

32:02.917 --> 32:05.086
That is too late.

32:11.226 --> 32:13.427
Use this.

32:14.696 --> 32:16.497
The twins.

32:18.200 --> 32:20.234
- Ready one for the cradle.
- Me?

32:20.268 --> 32:23.470
I'm...

32:23.505 --> 32:25.205
We should wait for Maddox.

32:26.407 --> 32:28.642
What did I just say?

32:31.746 --> 32:33.113
Locke.

32:37.151 --> 32:39.620
Your apprentice.

32:40.955 --> 32:43.323
Which one, Chamberlain?

32:46.327 --> 32:48.261
Which sister should it be?

32:57.138 --> 32:58.304
(gasping)

33:00.941 --> 33:03.209
(gasping)

33:04.878 --> 33:06.779
This one still has some taut.

33:08.949 --> 33:11.584
It should be
the other one.

33:11.618 --> 33:15.021
Her treacherous slatch
already droops like wet clay.

33:15.056 --> 33:17.056
(crying)

33:22.663 --> 33:25.565
(reciting Hebrew prayer)

33:31.304 --> 33:33.305
(door opens)

33:38.713 --> 33:40.446
Leave me.

33:58.998 --> 34:03.435
You are never
to go to that room.

34:04.504 --> 34:07.607
You have made that
more than clear.

34:07.641 --> 34:10.074
But the steward needed vellum

34:10.109 --> 34:14.079
and demanded
I retrieve it.

34:14.112 --> 34:16.147
Aiden,

34:16.181 --> 34:20.418
you have no reason to fear.

34:20.452 --> 34:24.688
Your devotion
is between you and your God.

34:26.291 --> 34:29.393
This secret does not hold us.

34:37.335 --> 34:39.837
Secrets never do.

35:05.363 --> 35:07.864
(Clara sobbing)

35:23.113 --> 35:26.883
She finally gave truth.

35:26.917 --> 35:28.851
The Earl of Pembroke
hides Gaveston

35:28.886 --> 35:30.953
at a monastery
in Deddington.

35:42.266 --> 35:44.267
(door opens)

36:00.649 --> 36:02.984
(water splashes)

36:08.180 --> 36:11.180
Should I ask why this
is stained in blood?

36:11.181 --> 36:12.716
Your source,
Chamberlain?

36:12.750 --> 36:14.351
The twin maidens.

36:14.385 --> 36:17.354
Edward's condolence gift.

36:17.388 --> 36:19.756
Gaveston's half-sisters
and conspirators.

36:19.790 --> 36:21.558
The king's other gifts
have been expelled.

36:21.592 --> 36:23.226
Due caution.

36:23.261 --> 36:26.863
How do we capture him,
gentlemen?

36:26.897 --> 36:29.232
The Earl of Pembroke
hides Gaveston in secret.

36:29.266 --> 36:31.200
His guard will
be limited.

36:31.235 --> 36:33.502
'Tis best to go in quietly
with a half legion.

36:33.536 --> 36:36.172
We will take Master Gawain
and his soldier.

36:36.206 --> 36:37.840
There is also
a trapper

36:37.875 --> 36:39.575
in servitude
who knows the marshes.

36:39.609 --> 36:41.377
LEON:
Why take the punisher?

36:42.813 --> 36:45.447
This is not correction,
just capture and delivery.

36:45.482 --> 36:47.316
LADY LOVE:
I agree with the reeve.

36:47.350 --> 36:51.654
This is not a venture
for the common freeman.

36:51.688 --> 36:53.856
CORBETT: You have seen
Maddox fight, my lady.

36:53.891 --> 36:56.558
There is nothing common
about his skill with a blade.

36:56.593 --> 36:58.661
If something unforeseen
were to happen,

36:58.695 --> 37:02.298
we will need him
at our side.

37:09.238 --> 37:11.206
Ready our men.

37:11.240 --> 37:12.908
Chamberlain.

37:12.942 --> 37:14.576
Baroness.

37:20.149 --> 37:21.650
May I speak freely, Baroness?

37:21.685 --> 37:23.084
Is there any other way

37:23.119 --> 37:25.921
you know how to speak,
dear chamberlain?

37:28.624 --> 37:31.259
About our punisher, my lady.

37:31.294 --> 37:33.628
Although it is

37:33.662 --> 37:38.666
encouraging to see you
so committed to your subjects,

37:38.701 --> 37:42.103
one cannot help but notice
the individual time

37:42.138 --> 37:44.339
you spend with Master Gawain.

37:44.373 --> 37:47.775
Apparently.

37:47.810 --> 37:51.746
In devotion or the garden.

37:51.780 --> 37:53.448
Parts of the court that are open

37:53.482 --> 37:57.218
to all those who serve
within the castle walls.

38:04.359 --> 38:06.593
In the months
since Erik's death,

38:06.627 --> 38:09.663
you grow stronger, smarter,

38:09.697 --> 38:11.298
certainly more bold.

38:11.333 --> 38:15.169
You have become
formidable, Love.

38:15.203 --> 38:18.605
A voice that challenges me
and every pompous noble

38:18.639 --> 38:21.608
that rides
through our gates.

38:23.111 --> 38:25.079
It would be
the devil's best work

38:25.113 --> 38:27.947
to have scandal take that away.

38:43.497 --> 38:46.432
A word, if I may,
Chamberlain.

38:46.466 --> 38:48.634
I understand that Maddox has
the skill of a soldier,

38:48.668 --> 38:51.771
but his standing here
at the court...

38:51.805 --> 38:53.838
He is not
a knight, sire.

38:53.873 --> 38:57.509
Nor am I suited to
his brutal tasks.

38:57.543 --> 38:59.978
Fragile pride
is a trait best held

39:00.013 --> 39:01.146
by cowards, Reeve.

39:01.180 --> 39:02.981
I am not fragile,

39:03.016 --> 39:04.616
nor am I a coward, sire.

39:04.650 --> 39:06.385
I have earned my standing.

39:06.419 --> 39:08.053
And when you give this punisher

39:08.087 --> 39:11.523
more trust and favor than
your reeve, you insult me

39:11.557 --> 39:13.858
and all your
honored knights.

39:35.581 --> 39:38.917
(shuddering breaths)

39:49.428 --> 39:51.329
What horror caused this?

39:56.401 --> 39:57.935
I don't think
she can tell us, brother.

40:00.605 --> 40:04.174
JESSAMY:
There you are, husband.

40:04.208 --> 40:05.743
Where have you been all day?

40:05.777 --> 40:07.110
Tasks of the trade.

40:07.145 --> 40:09.913
And what tasks
strike back as such?

40:11.149 --> 40:12.716
A skirmish
with bandits.

40:12.751 --> 40:15.351
Of no consequence.

40:16.520 --> 40:18.221
This maiden,

40:18.256 --> 40:20.623

in your cage?

40:20.658 --> 40:23.459
Come, Mother.

Hello.

40:38.775 --> 40:40.509
From the baroness.

40:40.543 --> 40:42.377
A letter from her to you?

40:42.412 --> 40:44.113
Why?

40:44.147 --> 40:46.081
The court is in
need of service.

40:46.116 --> 40:48.117
Thank you.

40:51.288 --> 40:53.923
He said thank you, maiden.

40:53.957 --> 40:55.124
Yes.

40:55.158 --> 40:57.159
Yes, he did.

You are not with child?

was a desperate ruse
