- Thanks for doing this.

10:01.380 --> 10:02.720
Thank you for being here.

10:02.920 --> 10:03.920
This is fun.

10:04.120 --> 10:07.390
Hank mentioned you, uh,
had an interview at Arlyle.

10:07.590 --> 10:08.820
He did?

10:09.020 --> 10:10.290
Oh, I forget
he talks about me sometimes.

10:10.490 --> 10:12.020
I know that school.

10:12.220 --> 10:13.860
They're a huge
a cappella feeder.

10:14.060 --> 10:15.380
Five of the 14 Whiffenpoofs.

10:16.510 --> 10:17.360
Oh, I didn't know.

10:17.560 --> 10:18.460
Yeah.

10:18.660 --> 10:19.830
So?

10:20.030 --> 10:20.900
How'd it go?

10:21.100 --> 10:21.970
It went very well.

10:22.170 --> 10:25.240
Um, I have an offer, actually.

10:25.440 --> 10:26.370
Um, but, you know,

10:26.570 --> 10:27.970
it's very complicated
right now, so.

10:28.170 --> 10:30.040
But you're taking it,
though, right?

10:30.240 --> 10:31.540
No.

10:31.740 --> 10:33.000
Are you crazy?

10:35.660 --> 10:37.050
I mean, um...

10:37.250 --> 10:38.570
why not?

10:39.740 --> 10:41.740
Well, I can't take a job
in New York right now.

10:43.040 --> 10:44.220
Oh...

10:44.420 --> 10:45.410
That's too bad.

10:46.910 --> 10:48.910
Well, congratulations anyway.

10:50.410 --> 10:52.060
Thanks.

10:52.260 --> 10:53.320
Excuse me.

10:56.080 --> 10:57.100
[Emma] So if I taste it,

10:57.300 --> 10:58.570
it's not like a stroke,
it's actually in there.

10:58.770 --> 11:00.910
Yeah, it's not artificial rust,
it's real.

11:01.110 --> 11:02.170
[Teddy] Oh, okay.

11:02.370 --> 11:03.210
Real prepared rust.

11:03.410 --> 11:04.340
Great. Perfect.

11:04.540 --> 11:05.340
[Teddy] Okay.

11:05.540 --> 11:07.180
Yeah, and it is just...

11:07.380 --> 11:08.180
Oh, we're still
talking about this.

11:08.380 --> 11:09.210
...such a magnificent animal.

11:09.410 --> 11:11.550
I actually like going

11:11.750 --> 11:13.750
to the school plays
of my friends' children.

11:13.950 --> 11:14.890
That's gross.

11:15.090 --> 11:16.760
No. The bottomless need
for attention,

11:16.960 --> 11:18.590
it's not yet ugly,

11:18.790 --> 11:19.890
unlike adult actors.

11:20.090 --> 11:21.530
Doesn't a bottomless
need for attention

11:21.730 --> 11:23.100
make you feel at home?

11:23.300 --> 11:25.060
Why would I think that tonight
would be any different?

11:25.260 --> 11:26.400
I don't know.

11:26.600 --> 11:27.870
You can take the asshole
out of the English department,

11:28.070 --> 11:29.070
but you can't take--

11:29.270 --> 11:30.270
No. It's not going
to make sense.

11:30.470 --> 11:31.440
Hold on.

11:31.640 --> 11:32.770
You can't take
the English department out of--

11:32.970 --> 11:33.740
Nope.

11:33.940 --> 11:36.110
They can trace
its lineage back to 1882.

11:36.310 --> 11:37.140
Whoa.

11:37.340 --> 11:38.410
I can't do that
with my own family.

11:38.610 --> 11:39.810
Well, they hate you, so.

11:40.010 --> 11:41.280
No. Now, if June
doesn't give me a baby

11:41.480 --> 11:42.280
by next year,

11:42.480 --> 11:43.320
I'm getting two.

11:43.520 --> 11:44.450
That's not how babies work.

11:44.650 --> 11:46.990
I'm throwing away
her stupid, little cat-dogs.

11:47.190 --> 11:48.290
Oh, okay.

11:48.490 --> 11:50.460
You won't believe
what I just heard.

11:50.660 --> 11:52.830
Lily got a job offer
at the Arlyle School,

11:53.030 --> 11:53.990
and she's not taking it.

11:54.190 --> 11:56.160
- You mean she's taking it.
- Right?

11:56.360 --> 11:57.260
I mean, she has to take it.

11:57.460 --> 11:59.300
[clears throat]

11:59.500 --> 12:00.670
You know,

12:00.870 --> 12:03.940
if the university really wanted
to help with department morale,

12:04.140 --> 12:06.100
they'd give us a stipend
to keep us apart.

12:06.300 --> 12:07.410
[Lily chuckles]

12:07.610 --> 12:10.240
Well, maybe
we should take the job.

12:10.440 --> 12:12.180
We'd have a whole new set
of circumstances

12:12.380 --> 12:13.680
to complain about.

12:13.880 --> 12:14.750
Yeah, that's true.

12:14.950 --> 12:16.830
And there's New York, of course.

12:18.330 --> 12:19.730
You're not serious, are you?

12:20.840 --> 12:21.750
Maybe I am.

12:21.950 --> 12:24.160
Yeah, but we already
talked about this.

12:24.360 --> 12:25.520
Only in theory.

12:25.720 --> 12:26.490
There was no offer before, so.

12:26.690 --> 12:27.690
It's real now.

12:27.890 --> 12:29.130
- [Gracie] You heard about that.
- [Billie] Shenanigan.

12:29.330 --> 12:30.800
Yeah. All right.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.930
Well, um...

12:33.130 --> 12:34.170
maybe we should have
this conversation

12:34.370 --> 12:35.670
when we're hosting
a bigger event,

12:35.870 --> 12:37.170
like a wedding, or a parade.

12:37.370 --> 12:38.540
[Lily chuckles]

12:38.740 --> 12:40.290
Okay. You're right.
We'll talk about it later.

12:41.790 --> 12:44.230
Well, sure,

12:54.000 --> 12:56.970
[**]

12:59.570 --> 13:00.940
Oh, hey, guys.

13:02.880 --> 13:04.360
Hi. Yeah.

13:04.560 --> 13:06.060
Ah.

13:06.260 --> 13:07.900
You didn't mention
a department dinner party.

13:08.100 --> 13:10.540
I did not.
I wanted you to come over.

13:10.740 --> 13:11.570
Drink?

13:11.770 --> 13:13.560
I think something stronger.

13:16.890 --> 13:18.410
Hello.
June, is it?

13:18.610 --> 13:19.710
Tony. We've met
a couple of times.

13:19.910 --> 13:20.710
Of course.

13:20.910 --> 13:22.310
Hi.

13:22.510 --> 13:25.020
Did I see you're giving
a talk on <i>The Hunger Games</i> ?

13:25.220 --> 13:27.390
As it relates
to the gladiatorial ludi.

13:27.590 --> 13:29.420
I'm doing a seminar
on the literature of antiquity.

13:29.620 --> 13:31.690
What a perfect way
to liven it up.

13:31.890 --> 13:33.030
These kids and their bloodlust.

13:33.230 --> 13:34.230
[June] Mm-hmm.

13:34.430 --> 13:36.530
You know,
they also respond to sex.

13:36.730 --> 13:38.000
Oh?

13:38.200 --> 13:39.360
[June] Yeah.

13:39.560 --> 13:41.100
I show them everything they know
about eroticism in storytelling

13:41.300 --> 13:43.570
can be traced back
to the etchings on the pyramids.

13:43.770 --> 13:45.240
In fact,

13:45.440 --> 13:46.240
the very first Egyptian god--

13:46.440 --> 13:48.340
- Atum.
- Atum, that's right.

13:48.540 --> 13:49.840
He created himself,

13:50.040 --> 13:51.410
but he had no wife,

13:51.610 --> 13:53.410
so in order
to beget his children,

13:53.610 --> 13:54.750
Shu and Tefnut,

13:54.950 --> 13:55.880
he masturbated.

13:56.080 --> 13:57.580
Good for him,

13:57.780 --> 13:59.920
but from my own experience
with masturbation,

14:00.120 --> 14:01.350
I'm only hearing half the story.

14:01.550 --> 14:03.460
Does your husband teach
similar subject matter?

14:03.660 --> 14:05.020
Oh, no.

14:05.220 --> 14:07.540
No. He doesn't get to show
his students Caligula, either.

14:08.440 --> 14:09.730
- [Tony] And you do?
- [June] Yeah.

14:09.930 --> 14:10.860
[Tony] Wow.

14:11.060 --> 14:12.100
I wish I had some relevant porn

14:12.300 --> 14:14.370
to help my students
connect to philosophy,

14:14.570 --> 14:17.070
but it's tough to rely on
their attention spans.

14:17.270 --> 14:18.450
- So tough.
- Right?

14:20.060 --> 14:21.310
Well, you should
come to my talk.

14:21.510 --> 14:22.810
I will.

14:23.010 --> 14:24.610
It's a date.

14:24.810 --> 14:25.940
Okay.

14:26.140 --> 14:27.130
Great.

14:35.600 --> 14:36.990
- You can have her, you know.
- What?

14:37.190 --> 14:38.970
They have an open marriage.

14:42.580 --> 14:43.750
Interesting.

14:49.120 --> 14:50.240
So what are the ethics
of this situation?

14:50.440 --> 14:51.640
Do I just hit on
a married woman

14:51.840 --> 14:53.310
in front of her husband
without feeling badly?

14:53.510 --> 14:54.510
Is that how this works?

14:54.710 --> 14:56.340
No. There's
a whole protocol involved.

14:56.540 --> 14:58.640
How do you know this?

14:58.840 --> 15:00.510
Teddy has the hots
for Lily, but--

15:00.710 --> 15:01.980
Let's put it down.

15:02.180 --> 15:04.120
...June vetoed it.

15:04.320 --> 15:07.150
You know, don't sleep
with the boss' wife.

15:07.350 --> 15:09.940
I'm letting him think
that's the only obstacle.

15:13.440 --> 15:14.490
All right.
Good to go?

15:14.690 --> 15:17.160
Lily can't get the dream
of moving to New York

15:17.360 --> 15:18.330
out of her head.

15:18.530 --> 15:20.580
It's a 20-year fantasy.

15:21.650 --> 15:22.530
Well, if she wants
to go so bad,

15:22.730 --> 15:23.850
why aren't you guys
there already?

15:25.650 --> 15:27.360
Because it's a fantasy.

15:29.260 --> 15:30.480
She doesn't really want to go.

15:30.680 --> 15:32.360
Is that what you want?

15:33.830 --> 15:35.380
Are you kidding me?
What do I want?

15:35.580 --> 15:37.220
How the hell do I know
what I want?

15:37.420 --> 15:38.620
[Finny] Gentlemen.

15:38.820 --> 15:40.720
Oh.

15:40.920 --> 15:42.020
Is this the same bottle of wine

15:42.220 --> 15:43.720
that we've been giving
each other since you got tenure?

15:43.920 --> 15:44.790
The one and the same.

15:44.990 --> 15:46.620
Aw, that is so sweet.

15:46.820 --> 15:47.890
I'll take it inside.

15:48.090 --> 15:49.480
You know, I got this--

15:50.680 --> 15:52.610
Good?

15:55.680 --> 15:57.620
I should have been a surgeon.

15:59.050 --> 16:00.990
- Yes. There we go.
- Oh, missed that.

16:04.290 --> 16:05.560
[Finny] ...like redundancy...

16:06.560 --> 16:08.800
[grandfather clock ticking]

16:14.700 --> 16:16.840
[indistinct party conversation
continues]

16:18.070 --> 16:22.010
[**]

16:25.910 --> 16:29.820
[**]

16:30.750 --> 16:33.770
Wow. Look at this feast.

16:33.970 --> 16:35.510
I've got to be careful
not to have too much stew.

16:35.710 --> 16:37.010
Yeah. Watch your mouth.

16:37.210 --> 16:38.740
Yeah. Hmm.

16:38.940 --> 16:41.450
So, Lil.

16:41.650 --> 16:42.710
Congratulations on the job.

16:42.910 --> 16:44.380
Oh, June's been talking.

16:44.580 --> 16:45.450
[chuckling]

16:45.650 --> 16:46.420
Well, it sounds like
an opportunity

16:46.620 --> 16:47.950
too impossible to pass up.

16:48.150 --> 16:50.260
- Thank you, Paul.
- Right?

16:50.460 --> 16:52.460
Well, listen, guys, um,

16:52.660 --> 16:53.790
if you're headed to New York,

16:53.990 --> 16:55.760
I'm still interested
in this place.

16:55.960 --> 16:57.760
[Lily] You're still--
We've lived here for 18 years.

16:57.960 --> 16:59.400
18?

16:59.600 --> 17:04.140
No one should live
in the same place for 18 years.

17:04.340 --> 17:06.200
We'll keep that in mind.

17:06.400 --> 17:07.720
We're not going anywhere.

17:09.120 --> 17:10.230
[Rourke] All right. All right.

17:12.030 --> 17:12.980
All right. Yeah.

17:13.180 --> 17:16.150
Um, but, you know,
I'll make you a nice offer.

17:16.350 --> 17:17.280
Ah. Got it.

17:17.480 --> 17:18.880
I'll go 5% over market value.

17:19.080 --> 17:20.220
Honey, they said no.

17:20.420 --> 17:22.590
You'll need every penny
in New York.

17:22.790 --> 17:23.590
Those places are for real.

17:23.790 --> 17:26.290
Yeah, but
we're not selling, right?

17:26.490 --> 17:27.730
Just because you get
an offer for something

17:27.930 --> 17:28.690
doesn't mean that you have to--

17:28.890 --> 17:29.790
Wait. Wait. Wait, wait.

17:29.990 --> 17:30.750
We were going to talk
about it later, right?

17:32.050 --> 17:33.130
So we'll get back to you.

17:33.330 --> 17:35.050
Wha-- Wait. What?

17:36.580 --> 17:38.940
- [glass shattering]
- Whoa! Cosmo down!

17:39.140 --> 17:39.990
Here I come.

17:45.760 --> 17:49.060
[**]

17:53.800 --> 17:55.450
Hey, June.

17:55.650 --> 17:56.350
Tony.

17:56.550 --> 17:59.320
I heard that you--

17:59.520 --> 18:00.290
What?

18:00.490 --> 18:01.630
Well, uh, what did I hear?

18:01.830 --> 18:02.630
What was it?

18:02.830 --> 18:05.130
That-- What are you into?
What's your jam?

18:05.330 --> 18:06.130
What is my jam?

18:06.330 --> 18:09.670
Um, uh, we hike, a lot.

18:09.870 --> 18:10.970
Mm, no.

18:11.170 --> 18:11.970
That wasn't it.

18:12.170 --> 18:13.140
[Teddy] Hey.

18:13.340 --> 18:14.440
Hey. Hi.

18:14.640 --> 18:15.270
That's your husband, right here.

18:15.470 --> 18:16.210
[June] There you go.

18:16.410 --> 18:17.780
There he is,
and that's his drink,

18:17.980 --> 18:18.780
so that's great.

18:18.980 --> 18:21.450
Um, we were just talking
about hiking,

18:21.650 --> 18:24.350
and, um, if you had
any great routes,

18:24.550 --> 18:25.820
or other interests

18:26.020 --> 18:27.350
completely different
from hiking.

18:27.550 --> 18:28.990
I'm super interested in all--

18:29.190 --> 18:30.890
Let's just stick to hiking,
because that's a great--

18:31.090 --> 18:32.360
Oh. No, yeah.
Yeah, yeah.

18:32.560 --> 18:34.660
We took a great hike
through Jasper Park.

18:34.860 --> 18:35.690
- Jasper.
- Yeah, yeah.

18:35.890 --> 18:36.990
Enter in
through the south side,

18:37.200 --> 18:38.200
and keep taking
the center trail.

18:38.400 --> 18:39.160
Great.

18:39.360 --> 18:41.130
- Yeah. It's beautiful.
- Oh, yeah, great.

18:41.330 --> 18:45.200
Um, and when you do hiking...

18:45.400 --> 18:46.340
do you--

18:46.540 --> 18:50.210
is it just
the two of you hiking?

18:50.410 --> 18:51.580
When you hike...

18:51.780 --> 18:52.640
together?

18:52.840 --> 18:56.550
Or sometimes, like,
you hike separately.

18:56.750 --> 18:57.820
Or is there, like, a club?

18:58.020 --> 18:58.880
Do you go--

18:59.080 --> 19:03.140
Do you do hiking
with other hikers and people?

19:05.140 --> 19:05.990
Are you asking us out?

19:06.190 --> 19:07.840
June. Just June.

19:09.510 --> 19:10.400
You didn't have to pretend

19:10.600 --> 19:12.000
you were interested
in our hiking routes.

19:12.200 --> 19:14.400
Sorry.
Although I am a hiker myself,

19:14.600 --> 19:15.570
and appreciate suggestions.

19:15.770 --> 19:17.700
Hey. Can I ask you something?

19:17.900 --> 19:19.240
Hmm?

19:19.440 --> 19:20.870
Do you think
Lily's going to take that job?

19:21.070 --> 19:21.870
Yeah.

19:22.070 --> 19:24.280
Oh, I thought--
Um, I don't know.

19:24.480 --> 19:25.910
Um, maybe?

19:26.110 --> 19:26.910
She wants to.

19:27.110 --> 19:29.010
I thought for sure
she'd take it.

19:29.210 --> 19:30.620
Yeah. It's the opportunity
of a lifetime.

19:30.820 --> 19:31.920
Why wouldn't she, right?

19:32.120 --> 19:34.720
Yeah. So the conversation
we were having before this one--

19:34.920 --> 19:36.590
Yeah. You were flirting
with my wife.

19:36.790 --> 19:39.090
Yeah.

19:39.290 --> 19:42.590
So, did I cross a boundary,

19:42.790 --> 19:45.800
or am I within the framework?

19:46.000 --> 19:49.570
And if so, are we talking
something happening?

19:49.770 --> 19:52.020
Because that would be
pretty fantastic.

19:54.190 --> 19:55.190
We'll get back to you.

19:56.560 --> 19:57.580
Okay.

19:57.780 --> 20:00.250
Fair enough.

20:00.450 --> 20:01.250
Good, well, good.

20:01.450 --> 20:05.200
I look forward
to your response.

20:06.270 --> 20:07.990
- Cheers.
- Don't do that.

20:08.190 --> 20:10.290
Did he just bow
because I'm Asian?

20:10.490 --> 20:11.990
I think that was a bow, yeah.

20:12.190 --> 20:14.790
[Finny] I love Jack Nicholson
in <i>Chinatown.</i>

20:14.990 --> 20:16.130
And, you know,

20:16.330 --> 20:18.500
Faye Dunaway is so beautiful
in that movie.

20:18.700 --> 20:19.660
[Emma] Oh, my gosh, I know.

20:19.860 --> 20:21.130
[Finny] I could just
watch her for... forever.

20:21.330 --> 20:22.330
[Emma] So tragic.

20:22.530 --> 20:23.800
[Finny] Yeah. I mean, I could--

20:24.000 --> 20:25.670
I could watch her read
the telephone book because...

20:25.870 --> 20:26.770
- Who couldn't?
- ...she's so delightful.

20:26.970 --> 20:27.840
Do you know
that Robert Towne

20:28.040 --> 20:29.810
didn't even want
the last line to be,

20:30.010 --> 20:31.480
"Forget it, Jake,
it's Chinatown."

20:31.680 --> 20:33.080
- That's the best line.
- It's the best line!

20:33.280 --> 20:36.150
Did you guys ever finish
your argument about <i>Pinocchio</i> ?

20:36.350 --> 20:37.180
[chuckles]

20:37.380 --> 20:38.950
Well, "argument"
is a little strong.

20:39.150 --> 20:40.820
Interpretation is,
by its nature,

20:41.020 --> 20:42.320
a bit of a sticky wicket.

20:42.520 --> 20:43.790
What were the issues again?

20:43.990 --> 20:45.320
Oh, yeah. It's racist,

20:45.520 --> 20:47.660
and it's filled with allusions
to child slavery

20:47.860 --> 20:49.590
and demented Christian ideology.

20:49.790 --> 20:50.530
Yeah, except it's not.

20:50.730 --> 20:52.680
[Gracie screaming]

20:54.950 --> 20:56.830
I'm being published
in <i>The Atlantic</i> !

20:57.030 --> 20:57.940
Oh.

20:58.140 --> 20:59.000
They're--
They're publishing me!

20:59.200 --> 21:00.340
That's wonderful.

21:00.540 --> 21:01.340
Congratulations.

21:01.540 --> 21:02.270
That's--

21:02.470 --> 21:03.310
Yeah, so are you okay?

21:03.510 --> 21:04.540
[Rourke] Yay.

21:04.740 --> 21:06.010
[Gracie shrieking]

21:06.210 --> 21:07.700
- Wonderful.
- [shrieks]

21:09.700 --> 21:11.300
[applauding]

21:14.670 --> 21:15.890
[shrieks]

21:16.090 --> 21:17.820
[gasps]

21:18.020 --> 21:18.720
I need a minute.

21:18.920 --> 21:19.970
[shrieks]

21:22.010 --> 21:23.800
[Hank, thinking]
<i>I've never been that excited</i>

21:24.000 --> 21:25.780
<i>about anything</i>
<i>in my entire life.</i>

21:26.810 --> 21:28.700
Yay, Gracie.

21:28.900 --> 21:30.200
<i>That includes my wedding,</i>

21:30.400 --> 21:31.840
<i>the birth of my child,</i>

21:32.040 --> 21:33.890
<i>and my first orgasm.</i>

21:35.520 --> 21:37.410
Is that for real?

21:37.610 --> 21:38.830
Can you imagine that in bed?

21:40.190 --> 21:42.810
[Hank] I'm canceling
my subscription to <i>The Atlantic</i> .

21:43.010 --> 21:44.300
[Rourke] Yeah.

21:46.570 --> 21:47.420
[Gracie screaming]

21:47.620 --> 21:48.390
[Hank, thinking]
<i>A billion dollars</i>

21:48.590 --> 21:49.650
<i>could fall on top of me,</i>

21:49.850 --> 21:52.160
<i>and, you know,</i>
<i>toss in world peace,</i>

21:52.360 --> 21:54.340
<i>and my reaction</i>
<i>would be, "Good."</i>

21:59.580 --> 22:00.730
Gracie!

22:00.930 --> 22:02.430
Gracie! Gracie!

22:02.630 --> 22:03.940
<i>There's either</i>
<i>something wrong with her,</i>

22:04.140 --> 22:05.670
<i>or me,</i>

22:05.870 --> 22:08.540
<i>or, with overwhelming odds,</i>

22:08.740 --> 22:10.530
<i>humanity in general.</i>

22:12.390 --> 22:13.930
[whispers] I did it, Daddy.

22:15.360 --> 22:16.700
Yes!

22:17.600 --> 22:18.670
[screams]

22:22.500 --> 22:24.920
[phone buzzes]

22:25.120 --> 22:27.880
[indistinct party conversation
continues]

22:34.250 --> 22:35.530
...I mean, I had, like,

22:35.730 --> 22:37.540
one and a half
tequila sunrises by then.

22:37.740 --> 22:39.220
I wasn't in
the best position to...

22:42.760 --> 22:43.740
[Hank, reading]
<i>"Hey, Ash told me</i>

22:43.940 --> 22:46.210
<i>she said that</i>
<i>I'm 'jizzing' for you.</i>

22:46.410 --> 22:47.980
<i>You're married.</i>
<i>I get it.</i>

22:48.180 --> 22:49.880
<i>I'm sorry</i>
<i>a thousand times again</i>

22:50.080 --> 22:51.580
<i>for you know what.</i>

22:51.780 --> 22:53.750
<i>Please know that,</i>
<i>as you make this decision,</i>

22:53.950 --> 22:54.950
<i>don't think that</i>

22:55.150 --> 22:58.060
<i>I'm going to just be making</i>
<i>constant passes at you.</i>

22:58.260 --> 23:00.310
<i>This is just the job, I swear."</i>

23:11.290 --> 23:13.720
Check your texts.

23:21.060 --> 23:22.810
Okay. This is silly.

23:23.010 --> 23:23.920
I mean, it's not--

23:24.120 --> 23:24.820
It's something
that I need to tell you,

23:25.020 --> 23:25.850
but it's nothing.

23:26.050 --> 23:28.320
It's like--
It's less than nothing.

23:28.520 --> 23:29.620
I'm listening.

23:29.820 --> 23:31.820
Okay. So in New York, Tom--
You know, he tried to kiss me.

23:32.020 --> 23:35.160
Or, I mean, he did kiss me.

23:35.360 --> 23:37.500
I pushed him away.
I got really mad at him.

23:37.700 --> 23:40.470
He said that he was joking,
which I'm sure that he was.

23:40.670 --> 23:42.420
I just don't know
where his head was fully.

23:44.920 --> 23:46.540
That does sound like nothing,

23:46.740 --> 23:48.470
so let's just forget about it.

23:48.670 --> 23:51.310
Okay. Thank you.

23:51.510 --> 23:53.700
I'm sorry that I didn't
tell you when I got home.

23:55.500 --> 23:57.820
[cell phone timer ringing]

23:58.020 --> 23:58.970
The stew's ready.

24:06.840 --> 24:08.810
[indistinct party conversation
continues]

24:09.810 --> 24:10.960
It's certainly understood

24:11.160 --> 24:12.060
that the first poem
in <i>The Atlantic</i>

24:12.260 --> 24:13.000
is nothing more
than an amuse-bouche,

24:13.200 --> 24:14.570
but to be offered page 72,

24:14.770 --> 24:15.970
an early part of the magazine,

24:16.170 --> 24:17.130
I was thrilled already,

24:17.330 --> 24:18.200
but when I found out
that I was the second poem--

24:18.400 --> 24:20.070
- Stew?
- ...or anything after 60...

24:20.270 --> 24:22.310
page 14, page 97...

24:22.510 --> 24:24.480
that's where Billy Preston was--

24:24.680 --> 24:26.880
[Rourke] This can't happen.
She should have her own place.

24:27.080 --> 24:28.910
She's my mother.

24:29.110 --> 24:30.350
- [Joanie] Why not?
- You can't do that with mothers.

24:30.550 --> 24:31.350
- Stew?
- [Rourke] Yes.

24:31.550 --> 24:32.980
She can't switch houses.

24:33.180 --> 24:33.990
House, house, house.

24:34.190 --> 24:35.690
The woman can't stay with us.

24:35.890 --> 24:37.220
- Stew?
- Is that plate for June?

24:37.420 --> 24:38.420
I can serve June.

24:38.620 --> 24:39.990
[Teddy] That's okay.

24:40.190 --> 24:41.830
[indistinct party conversation
continues]

24:42.030 --> 24:43.430
- ..donkey-headed boys...
- Stew?

24:43.630 --> 24:45.600
...are a metaphor
for child slavery.

24:45.800 --> 24:47.570
[brays like a donkey]

24:47.770 --> 24:49.700
I broke
your damn toilet, Spanky.

24:49.900 --> 24:51.520
Serve yourself.

25:03.160 --> 25:08.040
[**]

25:10.170 --> 25:12.340
[Hank, thinking <i>] She loves me.</i>
<i>It's just a job.</i>

25:13.710 --> 25:16.210
<i>She loves me.</i>
<i>It's just a job.</i>

25:17.580 --> 25:20.380
<i>She loves me.</i>
<i>It's just a job.</i>

25:21.880 --> 25:23.050
<i>We can work it out.</i>

25:24.190 --> 25:25.550
<i>We will work it out.</i>

25:27.860 --> 25:32.060
[**]

25:38.900 --> 25:40.300
Hey, Julie.

25:43.910 --> 25:46.320
Uh, yeah.
Something is wrong.

25:46.520 --> 25:48.010
It's Mom.

25:53.350 --> 25:54.320
[indistinct party conversation
continues]

25:54.920 --> 25:55.980
...all covered in cheese.

25:57.620 --> 25:59.250
I mean, I would say I'm--

26:04.460 --> 26:06.890
[indistinct party conversation
continues]

26:09.630 --> 26:10.480
[chiming against glass]

26:10.680 --> 26:11.450
Hey, everyone.

26:11.650 --> 26:13.620
Thank you for coming.

26:13.820 --> 26:15.020
Every year,

26:15.220 --> 26:18.190
the university gives us
a small budget to get together,

26:18.390 --> 26:19.660
which is very kind of them.

26:19.860 --> 26:21.760
Or cruel,
depending on the year.

26:21.960 --> 26:23.090
[laughing]

26:23.290 --> 26:24.300
This year, it's kind,

26:24.500 --> 26:26.000
because, um,

26:26.200 --> 26:28.670
I get a chance to say
in front of people

26:28.870 --> 26:31.340
how proud I am of my wife.

26:31.540 --> 26:34.210
Lily got
an amazing job opportunity

26:34.410 --> 26:36.510
at a very respected school
in New York.

26:36.710 --> 26:38.840
Many of you already know.

26:39.040 --> 26:40.280
It's wonderful,

26:40.480 --> 26:43.510
and I just wanted to, uh,
show her my appreciation.

26:43.720 --> 26:44.620
To Lily.

26:44.820 --> 26:45.720
- To Lily!
- To Lily!

26:45.920 --> 26:47.640
Thank you.
I appreciate that.

26:48.800 --> 26:50.390
It's something
I'm very excited about, so.

26:50.590 --> 26:51.890
- As well you should be.
- So, what about the house, then?

26:52.090 --> 26:52.890
It's an incredible--

26:53.090 --> 26:54.990
[Billie] Wait a second.
Wait a second.

26:55.190 --> 26:57.810
Like, she got the job,
and he's going?

26:59.010 --> 27:00.130
Spanky's going to New York?

27:00.330 --> 27:01.230
[Hank] It's not your concern.

27:01.430 --> 27:05.540
Well, it does affect us
quite a bit.

27:05.740 --> 27:06.700
- Does it?
- How so?

27:06.900 --> 27:08.240
You know exactly how so,
you twits.

27:08.440 --> 27:11.180
Well, we haven't made
a decision,

27:11.380 --> 27:12.880
so it's not going
to affect you tonight.

27:13.080 --> 27:15.650
[Gracie] Oh, come on, Hank.
You have to go.

27:15.850 --> 27:19.350
A path has opened up for Lily.

27:19.550 --> 27:20.720
It's just...

27:20.920 --> 27:22.320
It happened for a reason.

27:22.520 --> 27:23.590
[Billie] How can they take it?

27:23.790 --> 27:25.220
Hank's qualified for nothing.

27:25.420 --> 27:27.060
What's he gonna do?

27:27.260 --> 27:28.490
Play sax in the subway?

27:28.690 --> 27:30.230
[laughing]

27:30.430 --> 27:31.230
Thank you, Billie.

27:31.430 --> 27:32.600
[Rourke] He's a writer.

27:32.800 --> 27:34.830
He can go to one of those
stupid coffee shops

27:35.030 --> 27:37.400
and be one of those cliches,
you know.

27:37.600 --> 27:38.540
He'd love that.

27:38.740 --> 27:39.740
That sounds nice.

27:39.940 --> 27:40.740
Yeah, it does sound nice.

27:40.940 --> 27:41.770
No, actually.

27:41.970 --> 27:43.570
Well, the poem that I wrote,

27:43.780 --> 27:45.580
the one that's coming out
in <i>The Atlantic</i> ?

27:45.780 --> 27:48.080
"The Seven Sisters of Tobias".

27:48.280 --> 27:50.050
I wrote that in the city.

27:50.250 --> 27:52.180
I'm just--
I'm so stimulated there.

27:52.380 --> 27:54.250
You can take a walk
on the High Line,

27:54.450 --> 27:56.750
or just stroll
through the Village

27:56.950 --> 27:59.560
with the ghost
of Allen Ginsberg.

27:59.760 --> 28:00.610
Have you ever been to New York?

28:02.710 --> 28:05.200
Hank, if you were to leave
in the middle of term,

28:05.400 --> 28:08.430
would the Chair just go
to the next person in rotation,

28:08.630 --> 28:10.130
or would we have to take a vote?

28:10.330 --> 28:12.390
- That's a great question. Yeah.
- How would that work?

28:14.220 --> 28:16.310
How's everyone liking
the stew tonight?

28:16.510 --> 28:18.140
I ground my own paprika.

28:18.340 --> 28:19.980
Oh, it's very good.
Yeah, delicious.

28:20.180 --> 28:20.980
That's good. Yeah.

28:21.180 --> 28:22.060
It tastes the same.

28:22.900 --> 28:24.030
[door opening]

28:26.030 --> 28:26.820
Hi, everyone.

28:27.020 --> 28:28.550
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

28:28.750 --> 28:29.550
Hi, Julie.

28:29.750 --> 28:31.990
Um, can I talk to you?

28:32.190 --> 28:33.260
Now? Like, right now?

28:33.460 --> 28:34.630
Yeah.

28:34.830 --> 28:36.080
Okay.

28:41.620 --> 28:42.470
[door closes]

28:42.670 --> 28:43.470
- Do you want more?
- Yes, please.

28:43.670 --> 28:45.140
Anybody want a refresher?

28:45.340 --> 28:46.840
- Yes.
- Yeah.

28:47.040 --> 28:48.140
[Hank] No.

28:48.340 --> 28:49.470
Okay, so, um, how are we--

28:49.670 --> 28:50.740
how are we doing?

28:50.940 --> 28:52.930
How we doin', you know?
How are we doing?

28:57.970 --> 28:59.100
[indistinct conversation]

29:00.470 --> 29:03.490
Uh, do you guys, like, after,
do you talk about it?

29:03.690 --> 29:06.690
Like, what was touched
and untouched?

29:06.890 --> 29:08.460
I would cool it down a bit.

29:08.660 --> 29:11.500
Teddy doesn't like
desperate men for me.

29:11.700 --> 29:12.930
Jesus. Desperate?

29:13.130 --> 29:14.170
[Gracie] Hank.

29:14.370 --> 29:15.370
Hank?

29:15.570 --> 29:18.500
I think we need an answer
to June's question.

29:18.700 --> 29:19.670
It's only fair.

29:19.870 --> 29:21.370
[sighs]

29:21.570 --> 29:22.960
Ask Emma.

29:25.830 --> 29:28.950
What? Why am I the only one
who has read the bylaws?

29:29.150 --> 29:30.550
It's, like, three pages.

29:30.750 --> 29:32.880
No. You know what?
I'm not telling you.

29:33.080 --> 29:35.150
[June] Emma, please.
We need to know.

29:35.350 --> 29:37.960
[Gracie] Emma, those are
a very difficult three pages.

29:38.160 --> 29:39.290
It's very dry stuff.

29:39.490 --> 29:41.360
Oh, god.
All right. Fine.

29:41.560 --> 29:43.660
If the chair
needs to leave his position

29:43.860 --> 29:45.560
due to force majeure,

29:45.760 --> 29:48.830
the position goes into rotation
and no vote is needed.

29:49.030 --> 29:51.000
- Force majeure?
- Mm-hmm.

29:51.200 --> 29:52.070
Oh.

29:52.270 --> 29:55.210
Since when is moving to New York
an act of God?

29:55.410 --> 29:56.340
[Teddy]
A job at the Arlyle School

29:56.540 --> 29:58.210
is an act of God.

29:58.410 --> 30:00.040
Do you know five of
the 14 Whiffenpoofs went there?

30:00.240 --> 30:01.330
That's a lot of Whiffenpoofs.

30:02.460 --> 30:04.150
* Whiffenpoofs...

30:04.350 --> 30:06.080
- * Whiffenpoo--
- * Whiffenpoo--

30:06.280 --> 30:07.520
* Whiffenpoofs...

30:07.720 --> 30:08.550
You're all doing my note.

30:08.750 --> 30:10.150
[all harmonizing]

30:10.350 --> 30:12.360
Please stop doing this...

30:12.560 --> 30:14.990
Please stop doing this.

30:15.190 --> 30:17.410
Where in New York
do you think you'd want to live?

30:19.180 --> 30:22.030
Well, actually,
I've thought about this.

30:22.230 --> 30:23.370
We love Brooklyn,

30:23.570 --> 30:25.600
particularly Greenpoint
and Williamsburg.

30:25.800 --> 30:27.070
- Oh, yes.
- Right?

30:27.270 --> 30:28.340
Um, of course,

30:28.540 --> 30:30.070
my commute would be much better
from the Upper West Side,

30:30.270 --> 30:33.080
but we'd probably
never be able to afford that.

30:33.280 --> 30:35.950
Well, you could if you...

30:36.150 --> 30:37.110
* ...Sell me your place!

30:37.310 --> 30:38.750
* You could
sell me your place! *

30:38.950 --> 30:40.080
* Come on
and sell me your place! *

30:40.280 --> 30:41.450
I hate it
when you get like this.

30:41.650 --> 30:42.550
Listen.

30:42.750 --> 30:43.450
Selling you this place

30:43.650 --> 30:45.420
would barely cover
the downpayment

30:45.620 --> 30:46.590
on a place in New York.

30:46.790 --> 30:48.430
[Lily] They did mention
a moving stipend,

30:48.630 --> 30:49.690
but you're right, Paul.

30:49.890 --> 30:50.760
We could use some extra money.

30:50.960 --> 30:53.970
And, um, the good news is

30:54.170 --> 30:55.970
that we also own the plot
right next to ours.

30:56.170 --> 30:57.230
Also not for sale.

30:57.430 --> 30:59.440
[Lily] I'd be very interested
in an offer, Paul.

30:59.640 --> 31:00.470
[Rourke]
Is it a large plot?

31:00.670 --> 31:02.240
Is it larger than this one?

31:02.440 --> 31:04.440
For God's sake.
What is wrong with you?

31:04.640 --> 31:06.390
Can you ever be happy
with what is?

31:24.610 --> 31:25.730
She'll cool off.

31:25.930 --> 31:26.830
Hey, Hank.

31:27.030 --> 31:28.230
I'll give you 10%
over market value.

31:28.430 --> 31:30.570
[Hank] It's not for sale
any time soon.

31:30.770 --> 31:32.100
Well, I just had

31:32.300 --> 31:34.010
a very interesting conversation
with our daughter,

31:34.210 --> 31:36.440
and she says that, um,
she's coming with me.

31:36.640 --> 31:37.910
[Gracie] Oh!

31:38.110 --> 31:40.140
She and her husband
have flexible work situations.

31:40.340 --> 31:41.110
Oh, that's nice.

31:41.310 --> 31:42.510
And she mentioned
that you, Hank,

31:42.710 --> 31:43.810
recently suggested

31:44.020 --> 31:45.980
that she move to a city
with more opportunities.

31:46.180 --> 31:47.150
Oh, there you go.

31:47.350 --> 31:49.520
I guess we're going to need
a bigger place.

31:49.720 --> 31:52.860
[Rourke] Well, this sounds like
good news all around.

31:53.060 --> 31:54.190
Win-win-win.

31:54.390 --> 31:55.630
No, no, no.

31:55.830 --> 31:56.960
Look. Look.

31:57.160 --> 31:58.760
We're not making a decision
right here,

31:58.960 --> 31:59.830
not with this group.

32:00.030 --> 32:01.170
So let's go back

32:01.370 --> 32:03.670
to our usual
awful, awkward conversation

32:03.870 --> 32:05.000
that we're all so good at.

32:05.200 --> 32:06.000
[laughing]

32:06.200 --> 32:07.040
All right?

32:07.240 --> 32:08.590
Because nothing is happening.

32:12.160 --> 32:13.460
But something is happening.

32:14.500 --> 32:16.950
Well, nothing's happening
right now.

32:17.150 --> 32:18.600
Julie just happened right now.

32:20.000 --> 32:23.020
It appears that the situation
is evolving in real time.

32:23.220 --> 32:24.060
Julie isn't going anywhere.

32:24.260 --> 32:25.470
That's not up to you, is it?

32:27.470 --> 32:28.990
I'm not going.

32:29.190 --> 32:30.140
I'm...

32:32.980 --> 32:36.030
...going to stay here,

32:36.230 --> 32:38.370
even if you go.

32:38.570 --> 32:39.400
Okay?

32:39.600 --> 32:41.790
So how's that
for a decision made right now?

32:57.870 --> 33:00.890
Hank, you know what,
I think I can taste the paprika.

33:01.090 --> 33:02.060
It's much fresher.

33:02.260 --> 33:04.400
- Yeah, it's a fresher taste.
- Yeah.

33:04.600 --> 33:05.600
Hits you more, yeah.

33:05.800 --> 33:07.930
- Let's play a game.
- Oh, yes!

33:08.130 --> 33:09.200
That's a great idea!

33:09.400 --> 33:12.740
Do you remember how we used
to all play Celebrity?

33:12.940 --> 33:14.070
I'll certainly never forget

33:14.270 --> 33:16.440
the time that Paul didn't know
who Andrea Dworkin was.

33:16.640 --> 33:17.910
[laughing]

33:18.110 --> 33:20.240
Lily, where do you keep
the pencils and the paper?

33:20.440 --> 33:22.710
No. This game is called
"Percentage Of Happiness".

33:22.910 --> 33:24.620
[Gracie] Oh!

33:24.820 --> 33:25.850
Goodness.

33:26.050 --> 33:27.720
I do not think
that I know that game.

33:27.920 --> 33:29.790
I think I played
that game once.

33:29.990 --> 33:31.890
I was at a book reading
with Johnny Franzen--

33:32.090 --> 33:33.360
It's a really simple game.

33:33.560 --> 33:35.960
So, how you play is
you answer this question--

33:36.160 --> 33:38.900
"What percentage
of happiness am I?"

33:39.100 --> 33:39.960
[Gracie] Oh.

33:40.160 --> 33:43.300
And, "What percentage
of happiness is so low

33:43.500 --> 33:45.140
that you should be willing
to make a change?"

33:45.340 --> 33:46.200
[Gracie] Oh.

33:46.400 --> 33:47.540
We'll just go around the room.

33:47.740 --> 33:48.940
Gracie, do you want
to kick us off?

33:49.140 --> 33:51.380
Oh. Um, yes. Okay.

33:51.580 --> 33:53.610
Um, well, um,

33:53.810 --> 33:55.310
as you know,
I'm having a very good day,

33:55.510 --> 33:57.550
so I think I would, um--

33:57.750 --> 34:03.290
Oh, I-- I would put myself
at, um, oh...

34:03.490 --> 34:05.290
95% happiness!

34:05.490 --> 34:06.420
Wow.

34:06.620 --> 34:07.660
And when would I make a change?

34:07.860 --> 34:09.930
Um, oh, I don't know.

34:10.130 --> 34:10.930
Um--

34:11.130 --> 34:11.930
Would you just--

34:12.130 --> 34:13.060
60%!

34:13.260 --> 34:14.470
Yeah, 60%.

34:14.670 --> 34:15.330
60%.

34:15.530 --> 34:17.170
All right.
I would, uh--

34:17.370 --> 34:19.090
[Lily] That's very interesting.
What about you, Hank?

34:20.120 --> 34:21.310
Oh, wait.
Actually, I already know

34:21.510 --> 34:22.770
the answer
to the first question.

34:22.970 --> 34:24.910
You told me a while ago.

34:25.110 --> 34:26.180
I believe it was 20.

34:26.380 --> 34:28.810
You are 20% happy.

34:29.010 --> 34:30.810
Oh.

34:31.010 --> 34:33.150
That does sound
pretty low, Spanky.

34:33.350 --> 34:36.250
- No, that's high for him.
- That does sound like Hank.

34:36.450 --> 34:37.390
[Lily] So question number two--

34:37.590 --> 34:40.160
what percentage
would you have to drop down to

34:40.360 --> 34:41.380
in order to make a change?

34:43.280 --> 34:44.330
10?

34:44.530 --> 34:45.660
Or...

34:45.860 --> 34:47.050
zero?

34:57.560 --> 35:01.400
[**]

35:06.470 --> 35:08.270
[indistinct party conversation]

35:14.010 --> 35:15.980
A little wine, hey?

35:17.640 --> 35:18.550
Or no?

35:21.520 --> 35:22.050
You know, guys.

35:22.720 --> 35:24.740
I've been thinking about it,

35:24.940 --> 35:26.470
and I think this just isn't me.

35:26.670 --> 35:28.410
For no real reason.

35:28.610 --> 35:30.570
It was fun imagining
what might be,

35:30.770 --> 35:33.340
but I'm going to have to
respectfully bow out.

35:33.540 --> 35:37.300
Oh. Are you sure?

35:39.300 --> 35:40.300
Oh, come on.

35:45.070 --> 35:49.180
[**]

35:53.880 --> 35:56.600
Honey...

35:56.800 --> 36:00.000
sorry I brought Julie into this.

36:00.200 --> 36:01.490
It was childish of me.

36:02.690 --> 36:03.740
I didn't handle it well.

36:03.940 --> 36:05.860
No, you didn't.

36:08.360 --> 36:10.610
You take that great job,

36:10.810 --> 36:13.220
and I'll keep my shitty job.

36:13.420 --> 36:14.750
You come out here when you can,

36:14.950 --> 36:17.920
and I'll go into the city,

36:18.120 --> 36:19.370
make it work.

36:24.780 --> 36:29.550
[**]

36:31.120 --> 36:35.120
"Marriage is sweeter,
sweeter than you think, think."

36:37.360 --> 36:39.210
- [Gracie] Anne Waldman.
- [Finny] Indeed.

36:39.410 --> 36:40.480
- "Stereo".
- Mm-hmm.

36:40.680 --> 36:42.230
Very nice.

36:43.130 --> 36:44.780
You know, there was
a period of time

36:44.980 --> 36:46.950
where Teddy and I
were long distance,

36:47.150 --> 36:48.120
and it actually
strengthened our marriage.

36:48.320 --> 36:49.150
Yeah.

36:49.350 --> 36:50.570
That's nice to hear.

36:51.810 --> 36:53.220
We developed
a different foundation

36:53.420 --> 36:56.160
for our own unique relationship,

36:56.360 --> 36:58.810
and it made us
closer than before.

36:59.780 --> 37:00.930
[Teddy]
Best decision we ever made.

37:01.130 --> 37:02.130
[June] Best decision.

37:02.330 --> 37:04.400
I mean, there are days
I want to punch him in the face.

37:04.600 --> 37:05.400
Don't get me wrong.

37:05.600 --> 37:06.600
[laughing]

37:06.800 --> 37:08.170
When I go on about my research.

37:08.370 --> 37:09.970
Funny story.

37:10.170 --> 37:11.310
You want to hear a story?

37:11.510 --> 37:12.780
I have the best

37:12.980 --> 37:15.310
long-distance relationship
story ever.

37:15.510 --> 37:16.350
And don't worry.

37:16.550 --> 37:17.410
It's not about me
wanting your house.

37:17.610 --> 37:19.020
[laughing]

37:19.220 --> 37:22.350
I've mentioned
my first wife, Barbara, right?

37:22.550 --> 37:24.090
Uh, God rest her soul.

37:24.290 --> 37:26.820
Well, she and I met in college,

37:27.020 --> 37:28.460
freshman year,

37:28.660 --> 37:32.260
and it was just supposed to be
one of those hook-ups.

37:32.460 --> 37:34.110
Damn, she was fine.

37:36.620 --> 37:38.340
Yeah. We went to her room
that first night,

37:38.540 --> 37:40.600
and guess what?

37:40.800 --> 37:43.170
I never left.

37:43.370 --> 37:48.380
I, uh, spent my freshman year
sharing a single bed with her.

37:48.580 --> 37:50.110
She was the one
who introduced me to poetry.

37:50.310 --> 37:51.520
Oh.

37:51.720 --> 37:54.700
We would, uh,
recite Blake to each other.

37:56.500 --> 38:00.660
We never spent one night apart
for all four years of college,

38:00.860 --> 38:02.640
and we got married right after.

38:03.640 --> 38:05.810
Had a destination wedding
like a couple of jerks.

38:06.980 --> 38:08.280
Tuscany, for God's sakes.

38:10.050 --> 38:13.990
Well, we didn't get into
the same Ph.D. program, though.

38:15.660 --> 38:16.740
The closest
we could get to each other

38:16.940 --> 38:20.240
was a 12-hour drive.

38:20.440 --> 38:22.400
I went to Chapel Hill
and she went to Chicago.

38:23.660 --> 38:27.720
And I just remember
missing her so much

38:27.920 --> 38:31.170
that I decided to go visit her
that first weekend.

38:32.970 --> 38:34.220
I didn't have a car,

38:34.430 --> 38:36.530
so I decided
to put up some flyers

38:36.730 --> 38:37.590
to get a ride,

38:37.790 --> 38:38.900
and I got one from this woman

38:39.100 --> 38:42.400
who was visiting
this guy down there,

38:42.600 --> 38:48.000
and we talk in the car...

38:48.200 --> 38:51.440
and it is...

38:51.640 --> 38:56.830
the most interesting,
brilliant ride of my life.

38:59.270 --> 39:00.770
Everything she says.

39:01.900 --> 39:05.590
She made the trip feel like
a hot-air balloon ride.

39:05.790 --> 39:08.510
[Gracie] Ooh.

39:11.710 --> 39:15.870
I thought I knew what love was,

39:16.070 --> 39:17.700
but I was just learning.

39:17.900 --> 39:20.570
I thought I had found my person,

39:20.770 --> 39:22.860
but I was fooling myself.

39:25.690 --> 39:28.040
She dropped me off at Barbara's.

39:28.240 --> 39:28.950
I took one look at her,

39:29.150 --> 39:31.250
and I...

39:31.450 --> 39:32.730
I asked for a divorce.

39:34.870 --> 39:40.320
Now that I knew
what love really felt like...

39:40.520 --> 39:42.210
I had to.

39:44.650 --> 39:46.460
I went back outside.

39:46.660 --> 39:50.400
I didn't know
how I was going to find her,

39:50.600 --> 39:54.760
but guess who was still there
in the car, waiting.

40:01.500 --> 40:03.180
- Yes!
- Come on.

40:03.380 --> 40:05.750
We've been together ever since.

40:05.950 --> 40:07.820
Yes.

40:08.020 --> 40:09.270
Quite a story.

40:10.970 --> 40:12.070
That's a divorce story.

40:14.170 --> 40:15.360

You should go with her, Spanky.

40:15.560 --> 40:17.330
Before she finds her Joanie.

40:17.530 --> 40:19.780
I already found my Joanie.

40:21.580 --> 40:23.020
You never really know
about people.

40:24.490 --> 40:25.500
No.

40:25.700 --> 40:27.300
I know my wife.

40:27.500 --> 40:28.710
I know Lily.

40:28.910 --> 40:30.010
We don't have secrets.

40:30.210 --> 40:33.090
We tell each other everything
right away.

40:35.430 --> 40:36.810
That's right. We do.

40:37.010 --> 40:38.630
Where does Tom live again?

40:39.770 --> 40:41.450
Mm.

40:41.650 --> 40:42.700
I think he lives in Greenpoint.

40:43.770 --> 40:45.120

Oh.

40:51.230 --> 40:52.360
[Emma] Since we're talking
about this again,

40:52.560 --> 40:54.470
I actually have a friend
who lives in the East Village

40:54.670 --> 40:56.170
who might be looking
for a roommate.

40:56.370 --> 40:57.170
She's super cool.

40:57.370 --> 40:58.170
She's an adjunct at NYU.

40:58.370 --> 40:59.470
That sounds really interesting.

40:59.670 --> 41:00.670
I'd like to talk to her.

41:00.870 --> 41:01.540
Okay.

41:01.740 --> 41:02.720
Or you could just
live with Tom.

41:03.720 --> 41:05.680
I don't want to live with Tom.

41:05.880 --> 41:07.410
Well, it's just an idea.

41:07.610 --> 41:08.800
Just a suggestion.

41:11.700 --> 41:13.080

41:13.280 --> 41:14.650
- It's in the west 40s.
- Oh.

41:14.850 --> 41:16.890
Do you have
any old boyfriends there?

41:17.090 --> 41:18.760
Okay. Let's go.

They're separated, actually.

Right now.

41:28.850 --> 41:29.980
You know, I'm not going.

41:32.690 --> 41:33.870
No one's keeping you
here, Hank,

41:34.070 --> 41:35.370

go ahead and--

Go. Support your wife.

to get rid of?

getting rid of anybody.
