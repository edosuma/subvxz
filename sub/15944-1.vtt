No. This collection was created

- It is.

His factories still produce
the finest fabrics.

05:57.700 --> 06:00.400
- So you have met him?
- Me? No. No, but...

06:00.433 --> 06:03.367
- Well, he's a legend.
- So he's told me.

06:04.233 --> 06:05.700
Forgive me, but I'm confused.

06:05.733 --> 06:09.867
If Monsieur Trouvier wants me
to design for his daughter--

06:09.900 --> 06:12.700

much more than his daughter.

Trouvier asked us to facilitate
the right partnership.

If this administration is going to
restore Paris as the fashion capital,

06:29.267 --> 06:30.833
- we'll need your help.
- Of course.

06:30.867 --> 06:32.500
I'm happy to give it.

06:32.533 --> 06:36.300
This is not an offer - yet.
More of an audition.

06:36.333 --> 06:38.700
You can understand
why Trouvier is cautious.

06:38.733 --> 06:42.933
He's been burned by some
unholy alliances in the past.

06:42.967 --> 06:45.500

07:31.400 --> 07:34.600
No, I didn't take this. But I know
the guy who's covering the trial.

07:34.633 --> 07:37.300
Why bother?
Everyone knows the verdict.

07:37.333 --> 07:41.600
I don't expect there'll be too
many folks sobbing over his grave.

07:41.633 --> 07:43.367
Well, no, there is one.

07:43.400 --> 07:46.133
But the Tribune cropped her out.

07:46.167 --> 07:49.066

- No.

- A glass of water?
- I don't drink water. Fish fuck in it.

08:27.133 --> 08:29.800
- Have you got any vodka?
- I will look. Pardon.

08:33.067 --> 08:35.567

gonna blanche me out.

Monsieur Gambon, may I ask, why us?

09:07.067 --> 09:09.333
Why did Trouvier choose this house?

09:09.367 --> 09:12.500
He didn't. He chose Durrant.

09:12.533 --> 09:15.233
But we did our research
and suggested he move on.

09:15.267 --> 09:19.533
Monsieur Durrant spent too many years
dressing the wives of German officers.

09:19.567 --> 09:21.600
Your house has showed
only one collection thus far.

09:21.633 --> 09:24.767

56:00.667 --> 56:03.300
call my editor?

56:07.667 --> 56:09.467
Right.

56:11.300 --> 56:14.100
How much do they pay you
at that magazine?

56:15.800 --> 56:17.500
Uh...
