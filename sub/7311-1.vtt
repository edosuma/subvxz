00:03.010 --> 00:05.136
Previously on NCIS...

00:05.160 --> 00:08.956
The funeral was held this morning
for NCIS Director, Jenny Shepard.

00:08.980 --> 00:12.740
Assistant Director Leon Vance
has been named to succeed her.

00:13.110 --> 00:18.656
Officer David, the liaison position
with NCIS is being terminated.

00:18.680 --> 00:22.736
McGee... I'm moving you across
to the cyber crimes unit.

00:22.760 --> 00:25.116
DiNozzo... you've been reassigned.

00:25.140 --> 00:28.306
Agent afloat, USS Ronald Reagan.

00:28.330 --> 00:30.616
Pack your bags...
You fly out tomorrow.

00:30.640 --> 00:33.396
Agent Gibbs...

00:33.420 --> 00:35.350
meet your new team.

00:40.650 --> 00:43.640
Morocco

00:47.770 --> 00:49.606
"Temptation"... Diana Krall

00:49.630 --> 00:53.460
* Rusted brandy in a diamond glass *

00:54.830 --> 00:58.966
* Everything is made from dreams *

00:58.990 --> 01:02.710
* Time is made from
honey, slow and sweet *

01:04.239 --> 01:08.596
* Only the fools know what it means *

01:08.620 --> 01:12.880
* Temptation *

01:14.280 --> 01:17.700
* Temptation *

01:18.120 --> 01:21.850
* Temptation *

01:22.990 --> 01:26.800
I can't resist.

02:44.520 --> 02:46.430
You want to get that?

02:50.830 --> 02:52.630
Hello.

02:52.930 --> 02:56.656
No, Special Agent
DiNozzo's been reassigned.

02:56.680 --> 02:58.076
Special Agent Langer.

02:58.100 --> 02:59.626
Maybe I can, uh...

02:59.650 --> 03:02.376
Uh, I don't know, several months ago.

03:02.400 --> 03:05.640
Well, I'm not authorized to say, but you
could try the personnel department and...

03:05.690 --> 03:06.820
Hello?

03:08.820 --> 03:12.006
Four months, I've been sitting
here fielding calls for DiNozzo.

03:12.030 --> 03:14.716
And I swear, they're all women.

03:14.740 --> 03:16.800
And that surprises you?

03:17.190 --> 03:19.956
Have you seen my Oman
threat assessment?

03:19.980 --> 03:22.900
Oh, is that what this is?

03:23.320 --> 03:26.316
And I thought it was copy
for a travel brochure.

03:26.340 --> 03:27.786
Come see sunny Oman.

03:27.810 --> 03:28.996
Give me the file, Langer.

03:29.020 --> 03:31.886
- Give her the file, Langer.
- Give her the file, Langer.

03:31.910 --> 03:33.926
- Good morning, sir.
- Morning, sir.

03:33.950 --> 03:34.726
Morning, sir.

03:34.750 --> 03:36.696
So glad we all agree on something.

03:36.720 --> 03:38.906
Agent Lee, Oman threat assessment.

03:38.930 --> 03:40.890
Right here, sir.

03:44.350 --> 03:46.356
Sorry, sir.

03:46.380 --> 03:49.450
Told you about calling me sir.

03:49.860 --> 03:51.870
Gibbs.

04:00.450 --> 04:02.066
Oh, a call came in for you.

04:02.090 --> 04:03.846
I took the message, sir...

04:03.870 --> 04:04.996
uh, Gibbs.

04:05.020 --> 04:09.506
Yes, I can see right here in the
"message taken by" box: Keating.

04:09.530 --> 04:12.110
- Uh, he said it was...
- Urgent.

04:15.300 --> 04:17.255
Special Agent Gibbs
for Detective Reynolds.

04:17.279 --> 04:18.666
It'll get better.

04:18.690 --> 04:21.360
Yeah... when he retires.

04:21.670 --> 04:22.930
All right.

04:23.780 --> 04:25.710
Grab your gear.

04:37.870 --> 04:39.140
Sorry.

04:57.790 --> 04:59.166
- Oh, my God, my fault, sir.
- Sorry.

04:59.190 --> 05:03.050
- Gibbs, I was pressing the wrong thing.
- She was.

05:08.830 --> 05:11.456
Sorry... didn't mean
to ruin your shot.

05:11.480 --> 05:13.440
It's okay.

05:19.580 --> 05:21.716
That's why they get
the cheap rates, you see.

05:21.740 --> 05:24.226
It's far away from everything.

05:24.250 --> 05:25.276
Didn't worry him.

05:25.300 --> 05:27.616
Paid cash up front, 18 weeks.

05:27.640 --> 05:30.396
Not curious you didn't
see him all that time?

05:30.420 --> 05:33.416
Life in the park bleeds
the curiosity out of you.

05:33.440 --> 05:34.936
Live and let live.

05:34.960 --> 05:38.000
I only came to see him
'cause his rent was due.

05:38.900 --> 05:41.666
Body's been in that trailer at
least four and a half months.

05:41.690 --> 05:44.600
Explains why no one
complained about the smell.

05:45.420 --> 05:47.310
Agent Lee?

05:50.200 --> 05:52.350
Found his stash.

05:53.170 --> 05:55.316
Must be at least $5,000 here.

05:55.340 --> 05:56.456
He's lucky it wasn't stolen.

05:56.480 --> 05:59.426
Keating, he's not lucky, he's dead.

05:59.450 --> 06:01.046
I'll tag and bag it.

06:01.070 --> 06:02.980
Langer.

06:05.710 --> 06:08.426
Deceased is Petty Officer
Steven Nicholas Vargo.

06:08.450 --> 06:11.586
Failed to report for duty back
in May, four and a half months ago.

06:11.610 --> 06:12.306
Where?

06:12.330 --> 06:13.266
Navy yard.

06:13.290 --> 06:17.196
Lived in auxiliary housing... left
work, didn't return to his room.

06:17.220 --> 06:19.716
I guess he found this little
piece of paradise more appealing.

06:19.740 --> 06:20.556
What sort of job?

06:20.580 --> 06:22.820
Strategic planning, building
right next door to ours.

06:22.850 --> 06:23.906
Security clearance?

06:23.930 --> 06:25.266
As high as they go.

06:25.290 --> 06:27.780
Okay. Get a statement.

06:30.030 --> 06:34.406
Mr. Palmer, tell Agent Gibbs
he can send in the B team.

06:34.430 --> 06:36.726
That implies there's an A team, Duck.

06:36.750 --> 06:38.626
Isn't there?

06:38.650 --> 06:40.096
They're all A teams.

06:40.120 --> 06:43.010
Perhaps some even A-plus.

06:43.350 --> 06:44.306
Sleeping?

06:44.330 --> 06:48.046
Well, there are other reasons why men take
their clothes off to go to bed, Jethro.

06:48.070 --> 06:49.366
Any evidence of that?

06:49.390 --> 06:51.840
Well, he did come to a sticky end.

06:55.120 --> 06:57.650
I'll go get the gurney.

06:58.170 --> 07:02.196
Single gunshot wound to the upper
temporal area, probably while asleep...

07:02.220 --> 07:05.236
The pillow was held against
his head to muffle the shot.

07:05.260 --> 07:07.696
Nothing to suggest a struggle.

07:07.720 --> 07:10.826
You know, the stench in here
must have been unbearable.

07:10.850 --> 07:13.046
Isn't anybody curious anymore?

07:13.070 --> 07:15.000
Bled out.

07:15.520 --> 07:17.090
Like him.

07:21.930 --> 07:23.406
Gibbs!

07:23.430 --> 07:23.966
Abby.

07:23.990 --> 07:26.196
I need a hearing test. I'm
going deaf. Am I talking loud?

07:26.220 --> 07:28.196
'Cause sometimes people
that don't hear very well,

07:28.220 --> 07:31.506
they talk too loud, except
sometimes, when I get water in my ears,

07:31.530 --> 07:33.556
I talk so softly that
people tell me to speak up,

07:33.580 --> 07:36.026
'cause I have that weird, you
know, gurgling, swishing sound in my head.

07:36.050 --> 07:37.206
Has that ever happened to you?

07:37.230 --> 07:39.066
Why didn't I hear the elevator?

07:39.090 --> 07:40.196
The stairs.

07:40.220 --> 07:42.440
You don't take the stairs.

07:43.640 --> 07:46.736
You are taking the stairs

07:46.760 --> 07:51.156
because you associate the elevator
with people you're trying to forget.

07:51.180 --> 07:54.846
Abby, I'm not trying
to forget anybody.

07:54.870 --> 07:57.220
What do you got?

07:59.400 --> 08:04.676
Nine-millimeter casing and a
147-grain LE hollow-point slug.

08:04.700 --> 08:08.976
We use LE hollow points, and
so do the FBI, Secret Service,

08:09.000 --> 08:11.226
Navy SEALS and a bunch
of other law enforcement,

08:11.250 --> 08:14.836
but it's not the kind of slug that
Joe Public can get his mitts on.

08:14.860 --> 08:16.570
What else?

08:19.060 --> 08:21.130
A number.

08:26.330 --> 08:28.346
One, two, six?

08:28.370 --> 08:31.186
One hundred and twenty-six.

08:31.210 --> 08:35.846
That is the number of days that
Tony, McGee and Ziva have been gone.

08:35.870 --> 08:40.106
I really didn't think you'd let it get into
triple digits, Gibbs, but now it's way more.

08:40.130 --> 08:43.590
It's like a third of a whole year.

08:44.430 --> 08:45.936
I miss them.

08:45.960 --> 08:47.996
Abby, you had lunch
with McGee yesterday.

08:48.020 --> 08:49.466
It's not the same.

08:49.490 --> 08:52.406
I miss them
collectively... as a group.

08:52.430 --> 08:54.216
My three musketeers.

08:54.240 --> 08:55.856
Tim is the only one I've seen.

08:55.880 --> 08:59.080
No Tony, no Ziva. I get
postcards from Tony.

09:00.080 --> 09:03.670
I want them back, Gibbs.
Please get them back.

09:09.570 --> 09:10.826
You have ten days.

09:10.850 --> 09:14.556
Okay, I don't want to
pressure you, so 12...

09:14.580 --> 09:17.850
but no more than two weeks.

09:22.700 --> 09:25.370
And stop taking the stairs.

09:27.090 --> 09:29.046
Agent Gibbs, I think
I have something...

09:29.070 --> 09:31.626
I have a connection between our
murder victim, Petty Officer Vargo,

09:31.650 --> 09:33.976
and former Navy Petty
Officer Brian Roberts.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.316
He and the victim served together.

09:35.340 --> 09:37.270
Put it up.

09:38.470 --> 09:41.196
On the plasma, Keating.

09:41.220 --> 09:44.496
That's Roberts on the left, and our
murder victim, Vargo, is on the right.

09:44.520 --> 09:47.716
Roberts got out six months
ago, but here's the kicker:

09:47.740 --> 09:50.706
Roberts was killed by a bomb blast
at a bar in Morocco overnight.

09:50.730 --> 09:51.656
Terrorist attack?

09:51.680 --> 09:53.886
Trying to get more now.

09:53.910 --> 09:56.066
Got a link to the
raw feed out of ZNN.

09:56.090 --> 09:58.676
- Unlucky coincidence.
- Must be.

09:58.700 --> 10:01.430
Oh, that's a hell of a bomb blast.

10:01.820 --> 10:02.856
Casualties?

10:02.880 --> 10:05.780
Four killed, including
Roberts. 13 injured.

10:10.060 --> 10:11.576
Oh, my God.

10:11.600 --> 10:13.550
Isn't that...

10:14.030 --> 10:16.270
Ziva.

10:25.560 --> 10:28.696
This number you are
calling is not available.

10:28.720 --> 10:29.260
Langer.

10:29.290 --> 10:30.700
Trying to reach an Israeli contact.

10:30.730 --> 10:32.346
He's got connections in
the intelligence community.

10:32.370 --> 10:32.866
Lee.

10:32.890 --> 10:34.626
Mossad wants us to put
it through channels.

10:34.650 --> 10:36.076
- They're not being very helpful.
- Leave it.

10:36.100 --> 10:37.556
Roberts and Vargo...
I want everything.

10:37.580 --> 10:40.636
Phone records, bank accounts, e-mails, last
time they saw each other,

10:40.660 --> 10:42.076
lastime they spoke with each other.

10:42.100 --> 10:43.820
- Got it?
- Got it.

10:44.540 --> 10:45.926
You find her, now.

10:45.950 --> 10:48.410
I'll do my best... Gibbs.

10:52.780 --> 10:54.186
Yeah.

10:54.210 --> 11:00.056
The logarithm of the quotient is the excess of the
logarithm of the dividend over that of the divisor.

11:00.080 --> 11:02.046
High school math, Pringle.
What's your point?

11:02.070 --> 11:03.876
I put the wrong divisor.

11:03.900 --> 11:05.996
- Recalculate. Dallas.
- Boss?

11:06.020 --> 11:07.636
Still need that encryption key.

11:07.660 --> 11:10.460
Still working on it, boss.

11:10.940 --> 11:12.810
Boss?

11:19.710 --> 11:21.700
Boss.

11:25.990 --> 11:27.726
I'm not really their boss.

11:27.750 --> 11:33.450
They just, uh, call me that because I'm a
field agent, you know, I carry the handgun.

11:34.130 --> 11:35.666
It's good to see you, boss.

11:35.690 --> 11:37.336
You heard from Ziva?

11:37.360 --> 11:38.926
Uh, yeah.

11:38.950 --> 11:41.406
An e-mail every week, until
about three weeks ago.

11:41.430 --> 11:42.726
I thought maybe she went on vacation.

11:42.750 --> 11:45.176
No. Try undercover, McGee.

11:45.200 --> 11:47.696
Undercover would make
sense, her being Mossad and all.

11:47.720 --> 11:49.966
Know how to contact her?

11:49.990 --> 11:50.806
Cell phone?

11:50.830 --> 11:53.030
No longer connected.

11:58.100 --> 11:59.156
Yeah. Gibbs.

11:59.180 --> 11:59.956
I found her.

11:59.980 --> 12:02.296
Had to call in a favor
from a friend at Pine Gap...

12:02.320 --> 12:04.366
You know, the big communications
base we've got down in...

12:04.390 --> 12:07.500
- Put her on.
- Done. You're connected.

12:07.930 --> 12:09.216
- Ziva?
- Gibbs.

12:09.240 --> 12:10.346
You okay?

12:10.370 --> 12:11.356
You heard.

12:11.380 --> 12:13.106
Yeah, raw feed out of ZNN.

12:13.130 --> 12:14.640
You might want to call them.

12:15.390 --> 12:16.516
Thanks for the tip.

12:16.540 --> 12:17.366
What can you tell me?

12:17.390 --> 12:19.636
Not much. I was undercover.

12:19.660 --> 12:24.586
Trying to win the trust of a man showing an
unhealthy interest in a Chechnyan terrorist group.

12:24.610 --> 12:27.150
Brian Roberts?

12:28.330 --> 12:29.956
Perhaps you should
tell me what you know.

12:29.980 --> 12:32.756
Old Navy friend of Roberts was
found murdered this morning.

12:32.780 --> 12:33.836
Steve Vargo.

12:33.860 --> 12:37.280
Worked strategic planning;
Top secret clearance.

12:38.820 --> 12:41.096
Who was the target?

12:41.120 --> 12:45.290
Roberts was meeting a Chechnyan
terrorist by the name of Milaana Shishani.

12:45.320 --> 12:46.946
By sheer luck, she escaped the blast.

12:46.970 --> 12:49.656
But Mossad does not
believe she was the target.

12:49.680 --> 12:50.520
Roberts was.

12:50.550 --> 12:51.506
Why?

12:51.530 --> 12:53.266
We can only speculate.

12:53.290 --> 12:56.786
But from what you've told me, it appears
that someone wanted them both dead.

12:56.810 --> 12:57.896
Cleaning house?

12:57.920 --> 12:58.896
Possibly.

12:58.920 --> 13:01.960
Who tipped you off about Roberts?

13:06.620 --> 13:08.700
Director Vance.

13:10.920 --> 13:12.146
Gibbs?

13:12.170 --> 13:14.820
We miss you, Ziva.

13:16.020 --> 13:18.300
I miss you, too. All of you.

13:19.230 --> 13:21.756
Even, uh, Tony.

13:21.780 --> 13:23.670
Gotta go.

13:24.220 --> 13:26.036
Um, take care, Gibbs.

13:26.060 --> 13:28.370
Yeah, you take care, too.

13:30.680 --> 13:32.866
Ziva.

13:32.890 --> 13:36.320
Go home, rest.

13:38.330 --> 13:40.670
A kiss for your father.

13:53.540 --> 13:55.660
Good night, Papa.

14:07.380 --> 14:08.436
What do you know about him?

14:08.460 --> 14:12.126
Boss, I'm not sure I can
exactly tell you what I know.

14:12.150 --> 14:14.360
Orders.

14:15.100 --> 14:17.440
Yeah, him.

14:20.090 --> 14:22.660
You okay, boss?

14:23.530 --> 14:24.316
Get back to work.

14:24.340 --> 14:26.330
- Yes, boss.
- Okay, boss.

14:30.700 --> 14:33.946
People say this is one of the
greatest sports photos ever taken.

14:33.970 --> 14:36.276
Muhammad Ali and Sonny Liston.

14:36.300 --> 14:39.036
May 25,1965.

14:39.060 --> 14:41.016
First round, first minute.

14:41.040 --> 14:45.216
Ali hit him, Sonny
went down, stayed down.

14:45.240 --> 14:47.156
Then all hell broke loose.

14:47.180 --> 14:51.610
Lot of people thought it was
fixed, thought Sonny took a dive.

14:52.180 --> 14:53.836
That what you think?

14:53.860 --> 14:59.070
I think it's easy to jump to the wrong
conclusions without all the facts.

15:00.600 --> 15:01.786
Swing away.

15:01.810 --> 15:04.266
You didn't break up my team
because of Jenny's death.

15:04.290 --> 15:05.176
No.

15:05.200 --> 15:09.456
Five months ago, I got a series of
anonymous calls from a Navy petty officer.

15:09.480 --> 15:13.546
Eventually, he identified
himself as Steve Vargo.

15:13.570 --> 15:19.826
Said he had gambling debts and that he was being blackmailed
into supplying highly classified data to someone.

15:19.850 --> 15:21.046
What sort of data?

15:21.070 --> 15:22.906
He wouldn't tell me.

15:22.930 --> 15:25.736
But Vargo was a specialist
in the Middle East.

15:25.760 --> 15:30.376
He said he'd downloaded a critical
file, but he hadn't passed it on.

15:30.400 --> 15:32.850
- Change of heart.
- I believed him.

15:33.310 --> 15:35.476
On the director's
orders, I flew to DC;

15:35.500 --> 15:36.536
I arranged to meet him.

15:36.560 --> 15:39.686
He was gonna give me the name of
that contact, but he didn't turn up.

15:39.710 --> 15:42.086
Next day, he didn't report for duty.

15:42.110 --> 15:44.106
Now I know why.

15:44.130 --> 15:46.086
You didn't answer the question, Leon.

15:46.110 --> 15:47.846
The reason I broke
up your team, Gibbs,

15:47.870 --> 15:51.796
was because whoever was
blackmailing Vargo was an NCIS agent.

15:51.820 --> 15:53.526
Not one of mine.

15:53.550 --> 15:55.180
No.

15:55.210 --> 15:59.480
From what Vargo told me, I
narrowed it down to three agents.

16:00.940 --> 16:04.780
Only reason I broke up your team
was so I could form a new one.

16:05.340 --> 16:09.490
So you can help me find out
which one of these three...

16:10.310 --> 16:13.530
is betraying their country.

16:21.610 --> 16:24.456
You were gonna get
around to telling me...

16:24.480 --> 16:26.036
Had no evidence.

16:26.060 --> 16:28.786
I figured I put you with
them, your radar would go off,

16:28.810 --> 16:31.576
and one day you'd come to me and say
you had a doubt about one of them.

16:31.600 --> 16:33.286
A doubt? A doubt, Leon?

16:33.310 --> 16:35.296
I got a doubt about
every one of them.

16:35.320 --> 16:37.356
Got a former FBI guy
who doesn't listen.

16:37.380 --> 16:39.276
Got a boy genius who doesn't drive.

16:39.300 --> 16:41.776
Got a lawyer who doesn't shoot.

16:41.800 --> 16:42.656
Langer.

16:42.680 --> 16:45.236
Made the jump to NCIS eight
months ago from the FBI.

16:45.260 --> 16:46.480
He got no special treatment.

16:46.510 --> 16:47.966
But you did recommend him.

16:47.990 --> 16:48.936
He called me.

16:48.960 --> 16:50.446
And you endorsed him.

16:50.470 --> 16:52.336
Now you're having second thoughts.

16:52.360 --> 16:54.536
Not the agent you
thought you were getting.

16:54.560 --> 16:57.016
Why don't you just say it?

16:57.040 --> 16:58.926
He used you to get inside the agency.

16:58.950 --> 17:00.206
Doesn't make him guilty.

17:00.230 --> 17:02.740
Just clever.

17:03.590 --> 17:05.906
Pentagon knows there's
a security breach.

17:05.930 --> 17:07.465
They don't know how bad.

17:07.490 --> 17:10.246
I seized all of Vargo's
computers and his hard drives.

17:10.270 --> 17:12.486
We've been working on them.

17:12.510 --> 17:13.796
McGee.

17:13.819 --> 17:15.316
That's why I moved him down there.

17:15.339 --> 17:18.086
Seven levels of encryption, so far.

17:18.109 --> 17:21.185
Every level harder to
crack than the last.

17:21.210 --> 17:23.656
I wasn't the only one
who Vargo contacted.

17:23.680 --> 17:27.046
Confided in his old
Navy buddy Brian Roberts.

17:27.069 --> 17:30.326
Then a week ago, Roberts
turned up in Tel Aviv.

17:30.350 --> 17:31.946
Vargo was a specialist in Israel.

17:31.970 --> 17:34.990
And that's why you sent Ziva back.

17:35.020 --> 17:36.406
Mossad mounted an operation.

17:36.430 --> 17:40.516
They were gonna pick up Roberts last night
in Morocco, but they weren't quick enough.

17:40.540 --> 17:43.366
Someone is tying up a loose end.

17:43.390 --> 17:46.506
I think Vargo told Roberts
the name of the NCIS agent.

17:46.530 --> 17:50.416
And I'm guessing Roberts was trying to sell
that name to anybody who was willing to pay.

17:50.440 --> 17:52.086
So, what?

17:52.110 --> 17:54.546
Four months, you got nothing.

17:54.570 --> 17:56.860
We got nothing.

18:03.340 --> 18:05.766
Vargo's computers have been seized.

18:05.790 --> 18:07.306
Standard operating procedure.

18:07.330 --> 18:12.576
It's in the agents' manual, section 35,
sub-section two, clause E: Seizure of evidence.

18:12.600 --> 18:14.286
You're making that up.

18:14.310 --> 18:15.626
And this matters why?

18:15.650 --> 18:17.056
They were seized four months ago.

18:17.080 --> 18:19.786
After he failed to report
to duty. Makes perfect sense.

18:19.810 --> 18:20.816
Who seized them?

18:20.840 --> 18:24.376
Us. This agency. NCIS.

18:24.400 --> 18:27.000
Then it would've been logged.

18:28.470 --> 18:29.656
Wasn't logged.

18:29.680 --> 18:31.956
Legally, that could cause a
chain of evidence problem.

18:31.980 --> 18:33.456
Got to be in the building somewhere.

18:33.480 --> 18:34.866
Evidence locker maybe?

18:34.890 --> 18:36.920
Down with the geeks.

18:39.810 --> 18:41.150
What?

18:41.570 --> 18:43.710
Okay. Talk to me.

18:45.460 --> 18:48.066
Update. Anyone?

18:48.090 --> 18:52.226
Sorry. Go, you go. Sir.

18:52.250 --> 18:53.166
Keating.

18:53.190 --> 18:55.826
Vargo closed out two bank accounts
the day before he disappeared,

18:55.850 --> 18:58.406
withdrawing a total of $11,350.

18:58.430 --> 18:59.856
No credit card transactions since.

18:59.880 --> 19:00.556
Agent Lee.

19:00.580 --> 19:04.476
Vargo's commanding officer is refusing
to see us without legal representation.

19:04.500 --> 19:05.406
Covering his butt.

19:05.430 --> 19:09.096
I'm having trouble finding a JAG officer
with the appropriate security clearance.

19:09.120 --> 19:11.276
You got anything, Special Agent?

19:11.300 --> 19:13.916
We seized Vargo's computers
the day after he disappeared,

19:13.940 --> 19:16.276
but they were never
logged into evidence.

19:16.300 --> 19:19.150
Probably down in the basement
with the rest of the...

19:20.790 --> 19:22.766
I'll handle it.

19:22.790 --> 19:24.256
Witness statements.

19:24.280 --> 19:26.140
Yes, sir.

19:40.300 --> 19:44.430
This is Agent Lee, NCIS.
Is Major Clay available?

19:47.470 --> 19:48.950
I'll hold.

19:53.120 --> 19:54.086
- Night, boss.
- See you tomorrow, boss.

19:54.110 --> 19:55.866
- Bye, boss.
- Night, boss.

19:55.890 --> 19:57.536
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

19:57.560 --> 19:59.300
Good night, boss.

20:00.810 --> 20:01.806
You call him?

20:01.830 --> 20:03.286
Director's on his way down.

20:03.310 --> 20:06.270
You like working down here, McGee?

20:06.590 --> 20:07.626
Boss, I'm sorry.

20:07.650 --> 20:10.876
He made it very clear to me that I-I
couldn't talk to anyone except for him.

20:10.900 --> 20:12.816
Wouldn't have stopped
you in the past.

20:12.840 --> 20:14.086
Well, it's not the same.

20:14.110 --> 20:14.956
We were a team.

20:14.980 --> 20:17.866
I would give this up in a heartbeat to
be back working with you and Ziva again.

20:17.890 --> 20:20.016
And DiNozzo?

20:20.040 --> 20:22.260
Yeah, him, too.

20:23.840 --> 20:25.196
You can tell him, McGee.

20:25.220 --> 20:27.066
We cracked the eighth
level of encryption.

20:27.090 --> 20:28.386
Which is not actually accurate

20:28.410 --> 20:30.616
because they're not really
levels of encryption so much

20:30.640 --> 20:35.276
as packets of information all encrypted
with a new layer of protection that...

20:35.300 --> 20:37.686
that you really don't
need to know about.

20:37.710 --> 20:41.166
Now, this next series of packets
contained system archives,

20:41.190 --> 20:45.480
logging information, time-stamped
data transfer reports...

20:46.370 --> 20:48.646
I really have been down
here too long, haven't I?

20:48.670 --> 20:52.536
Okay. The day before he disappeared, Vargo
connected a thumb drive about this size

20:52.560 --> 20:56.506
to a classified computer and
downloaded a 2.75 gigabyte file.

20:56.530 --> 20:57.686
What sort of data?

20:57.710 --> 20:59.826
Don't know. Haven't cracked
that level of encryption.

20:59.850 --> 21:01.896
Something he could easily hide.

21:01.920 --> 21:03.386
Probably took it with him.

21:03.410 --> 21:05.700
Or put it some place safe.

21:06.560 --> 21:08.046
Maybe.

21:08.070 --> 21:09.136
Thank you, McGee.

21:09.160 --> 21:11.106
Keep Agent Gibbs in the loop.

21:11.130 --> 21:13.150
Will do.

21:14.240 --> 21:16.330
Good night, Director.

21:16.770 --> 21:18.680
- Good night, boss.
- Night.

21:19.870 --> 21:21.446
Solve this first, then we'll talk.

21:21.470 --> 21:23.460
Ziva, too.

21:29.060 --> 21:30.786
Good morning, Dr. Gibbs.

21:30.810 --> 21:32.786
Hey, Duck, what's this shadow here?

21:32.810 --> 21:34.866
This area right here.

21:34.890 --> 21:38.376
It's a clearly marked fracture
of the ramus mandibulae.

21:38.400 --> 21:40.116
Broken jaw.

21:40.140 --> 21:41.966
Caused by a blunt instrument.

21:41.990 --> 21:43.956
Possibly the butt of the gun.

21:43.980 --> 21:45.816
No signs of a fight at the scene.

21:45.840 --> 21:48.216
Already in the bed, possibly asleep.

21:48.240 --> 21:50.316
Something disturbs him, a noise.

21:50.340 --> 21:52.876
Before he can get
up, the assailant strikes.

21:52.900 --> 21:53.736
Unconscious?

21:53.760 --> 21:55.386
Or dazed, certainly.

21:55.410 --> 22:00.846
Allowing the assailant time to pick up
a pillow to silence the fatal gunshot.

22:00.870 --> 22:02.336
No surprises, Jethro.

22:02.360 --> 22:06.486
No telltale marks or bruises to
help you with your investigation.

22:06.510 --> 22:11.280
Just a rather unrevealing
death, I'm sorry to say.

22:12.470 --> 22:14.176
Did I miss something?

22:14.200 --> 22:16.506
The pillow.

22:16.530 --> 22:19.180
- The pillow?
- Yeah. The pillow.

22:21.340 --> 22:22.666
The pillow.

22:22.690 --> 22:25.170
Abs!! I really
really miss you. LOVE TONY.

22:28.880 --> 22:31.116
Abs, the pillow.

22:31.140 --> 22:33.170
- Good morning, Gibbs.
- Morning.

22:33.550 --> 22:35.416
- Thanks.
- You're welcome. The pillow.

22:35.440 --> 22:38.546
The one with the bullet hole, or the
one with the blood and the bullet hole?

22:38.570 --> 22:41.160
The one the killer fired through.

22:45.790 --> 22:47.716
- Powder burns?
- Some.

22:47.740 --> 22:48.466
Problem?

22:48.490 --> 22:51.406
There's just not as much
as I would have expected,

22:51.430 --> 22:56.486
and if you jam a gun into a pillow
to suppress the noise of a gunshot,

22:56.510 --> 22:58.186
there would be more powder burns.

22:58.210 --> 23:01.630
They would leave a distinct pattern
in the creases of the pillow.

23:03.070 --> 23:04.200
See?

23:04.230 --> 23:05.906
It's barely even scrunched up at all.

23:05.930 --> 23:09.826
As a means of silencing a gunshot, this
wouldn't be very effective.

23:09.850 --> 23:12.536
Wasn't trying to silence the gunshot.

23:12.560 --> 23:15.220
Just wanted to cover
the victim's face.

23:16.530 --> 23:17.956
Squeamish shooter.

23:17.980 --> 23:19.306
Sounds like something I would do.

23:19.330 --> 23:20.496
I mean, if I were to do it.

23:20.520 --> 23:22.686
- Not that I would ever do it, but if I were to do it...
- Yeah. Gibbs.

23:22.710 --> 23:23.796
Boss, I got something here.

23:23.820 --> 23:24.796
Be right down.

23:24.820 --> 23:27.326
But if I did, I would shut my eyes.

23:27.350 --> 23:30.320
Or... Or use a pillow.

23:30.640 --> 23:32.420
Yeah.

23:33.100 --> 23:34.836
Got something here, boss.

23:34.860 --> 23:36.926
Want to call Vance?

23:36.950 --> 23:38.836
No, he can wait.

23:38.860 --> 23:41.636
We did an extensive search
through Vargo's phone records.

23:41.660 --> 23:43.170
Home, office, cell.

23:43.200 --> 23:44.926
No unusual flagged numbers.

23:44.950 --> 23:48.646
McGee, you did not get me down here
to tell me something you didn't find.

23:48.670 --> 23:51.796
The trailer park has a pay phone;
Searched through the phone records.

23:51.820 --> 23:57.056
The day after Vargo moved in, there were three
calls placed from that pay phone to NCIS.

23:57.080 --> 23:58.336
- Who?
- Main switchboard.

23:58.360 --> 24:03.676
But by crosschecking the phone log on the main server
against all incoming calls at the time reference...

24:03.700 --> 24:05.970
the legal department.

24:06.620 --> 24:08.880
Special Agent Lee.

24:19.410 --> 24:23.856
Uh, is this something I
should be seeking advice on?

24:23.880 --> 24:25.156
You're the lawyer, Agent Lee.

24:25.180 --> 24:27.436
You feel you need counsel, by
all means, call someone.

24:27.460 --> 24:31.506
I never knowingly had any contact
with Petty Officer Steve Vargo.

24:31.530 --> 24:37.200
He called you three times from a pay phone at
the trailer park just before he was murdered.

24:37.780 --> 24:40.016
Oh, my God. That was him.

24:40.040 --> 24:41.466
You remember talking to him?

24:41.490 --> 24:43.236
The timing's right.

24:43.260 --> 24:48.326
And, four months ago, I received three calls
from a man who refused to identify himself.

24:48.350 --> 24:51.036
It was from a pay phone, and I
could hear him feeding the coins.

24:51.060 --> 24:52.656
He wanted legal advice.

24:52.680 --> 24:53.346
About what?

24:53.370 --> 24:55.526
He said he'd been
stealing from the Pentagon.

24:55.550 --> 24:56.706
He wouldn't say what.

24:56.730 --> 24:59.876
I figured it was siphoning off
money from a Pentagon account.

24:59.900 --> 25:02.776
He refused to say, and then
he just stopped calling.

25:02.800 --> 25:04.106
And you didn't tell anyone?

25:04.130 --> 25:06.066
I filed a report and
I put it in the system.

25:06.090 --> 25:08.156
It was very thin. Nothing to go on.

25:08.180 --> 25:11.200
Nobody ever asked me about it.

25:12.900 --> 25:16.456
If you check my report filings
for that week, you'll find them.

25:16.480 --> 25:19.036
Shouldn't be a problem then.

25:19.060 --> 25:20.016
Thank you, Agent Lee.

25:20.040 --> 25:22.906
Would you ask McGee to step
in on your way out, please?

25:22.930 --> 25:24.390
Yes, sir.

25:25.000 --> 25:27.220
Sir...

25:30.410 --> 25:32.620
Sounds credible.

25:33.310 --> 25:36.040
That's what Vargo said to me.

25:36.300 --> 25:38.120
Maybe.

25:41.260 --> 25:46.676
McGee, Check Lee's files on the days that
Vargo called and see if she logged in a report.

25:46.700 --> 25:49.516
Full background checks on all
of them... Lee, Keating, Langer.

25:49.540 --> 25:51.406
Phone records, bank
cards, credit cards.

25:51.430 --> 25:52.036
Got it.

25:52.060 --> 25:53.626
Any update with the hard drive?

25:53.650 --> 25:58.976
Well, we're still trying to crack the
encryption, but there may be another way.

25:59.000 --> 26:03.456
See, I think that we can find out what
classified material Vargo was downloading.

26:03.480 --> 26:04.336
Go on.

26:04.360 --> 26:07.276
The only information we have
is the file's hash number.

26:07.300 --> 26:08.616
Every file has one.

26:08.640 --> 26:09.806
And no two are the same.

26:09.830 --> 26:13.216
So, if we can access the Pentagon's
system, we can scan for that hash number,

26:13.240 --> 26:16.336
and it should lead us to
the file Vargo downloaded.

26:16.360 --> 26:18.706
Course, we would have to
go through some channels.

26:18.730 --> 26:21.190
That the fastest way?

26:21.550 --> 26:24.210
I was worried you might ask me that.

26:26.730 --> 26:29.940
We didn't have this conversation.

26:32.930 --> 26:34.956
McGoo, it's true.

26:34.980 --> 26:36.486
TV really does add ten pounds.

26:36.510 --> 26:38.626
You been hitting the jelly
donuts again? How do I look?

26:38.650 --> 26:40.376
Well, I never thought I'd
say it and truly mean it,

26:40.400 --> 26:42.496
but it's good to see you, Tony.

26:42.520 --> 26:43.746
I miss you, too, probie.

26:43.770 --> 26:46.986
First the USS Ronald Reagan, now
the Seahawk. How's life afloat?

26:47.010 --> 26:49.226
Ah, life on the ocean
blue, me hearties.

26:49.250 --> 26:52.456
The scurvy don't get
you, then the pox will.

26:52.480 --> 26:55.286
And tell me this, me
little McShipmate...

26:55.310 --> 27:00.576
How is that scurrilous, black-hearted
pirate king of ours, Captain One-Shot Gibbs?

27:00.600 --> 27:03.330
I'm just fine, DiNozzo.

27:07.910 --> 27:09.826
There you go, boss. Welcome aboard.

27:09.850 --> 27:10.976
Got work to do.

27:11.000 --> 27:12.826
I'm on it, boss. What am I on, McGee?

27:12.850 --> 27:13.846
Are you alone?

27:13.870 --> 27:15.566
Oh, yeah.

27:15.590 --> 27:17.816
Just me and 5,000 of
my closest friends.

27:17.840 --> 27:20.570
I am never alone.

27:21.950 --> 27:23.376
I really need to come home, boss.

27:23.400 --> 27:24.416
I'm working on it.

27:24.440 --> 27:29.016
The only way that we're gonna access this information
is from a secure naval communications room,

27:29.040 --> 27:30.646
so you are it.

27:30.670 --> 27:32.116
Now here it is: I'm
gonna give you a code.

27:32.140 --> 27:35.176
You're gonna enter it into
the keyboard; When you do,

27:35.200 --> 27:39.036
it's going to ask you for a
password and an authorization key.

27:39.060 --> 27:40.430
Dad.

27:41.050 --> 27:43.406
This is why I don't
want Tim driving my car.

27:43.430 --> 27:46.556
You know, I told Tim that
that's my car, and I...

27:46.580 --> 27:48.846
it's not a family car, it's my car.

27:48.870 --> 27:50.166
I don't like the cut
of your jib, McGee.

27:50.190 --> 27:53.786
This sounds suspiciously like
illegal activity, and, well,

27:53.810 --> 27:57.186
a man of my delicate disposition
is not suited to that kind of thing.

27:57.210 --> 27:59.580
Don't be such a girl, all right?

28:00.320 --> 28:00.956
Ready?

28:00.980 --> 28:04.916
Seven, Delta, X-ray, four, niner,

28:04.940 --> 28:09.206
eight, three, three, zero, six, Zulu.

28:09.230 --> 28:12.106
Password is bluemoon... one word.

28:12.130 --> 28:16.876
Authorization key is
Foxtrot, Oscar, Charlie, Bravo.

28:16.900 --> 28:19.840
Bravo. All right.
Opened a search page.

28:21.200 --> 28:23.536
Is this hacking, McGee?
Are we hacking?

28:23.560 --> 28:24.966
We are not hacking, Tony.

28:24.990 --> 28:28.530
But it is illegal, right? Don't
answer that. I know it's illegal.

28:29.020 --> 28:29.986
I'm having fun.

28:30.010 --> 28:33.116
In the search parameters, enter
the hash symbol,

28:33.140 --> 28:37.356
then
two-seven-five, three-one-nine,

28:37.380 --> 28:39.876
forward slash, Delta, X-ray.

28:39.900 --> 28:42.050
Click on file.

28:43.270 --> 28:44.166
Dad!

28:44.190 --> 28:46.226
It's my point exactly, Dad.

28:46.250 --> 28:48.346
It's just not fair.

28:48.370 --> 28:50.570
All right, it's searching.

28:51.330 --> 28:53.816
Waiting. More waiting.

28:53.840 --> 28:54.956
What do you see?

28:54.980 --> 28:58.566
A short life, McGee.
Yours, if I get caught.

28:58.590 --> 29:01.366
Great. Next stop, Gitmo. I got a hit.

29:01.390 --> 29:04.360
Download the summary
file and e-mail it to me.

29:11.460 --> 29:13.576
Well, it's been great
talking with you, Pa.

29:13.600 --> 29:15.466
Thanks, Tim.

29:15.490 --> 29:16.366
You know I love you guys.

29:16.390 --> 29:18.406
It's just that Tim
always messes my stuff up.

29:18.430 --> 29:21.286
He doesn't know how to shift
gears, he doesn't change the oil.

29:21.310 --> 29:23.006
Make sure you feed the chickens.

29:23.030 --> 29:24.686
Say hi to Mom.

29:24.710 --> 29:26.656
- He's insane.
- Oh, yeah.

29:26.680 --> 29:28.416
Thank you, Tony.

29:28.440 --> 29:30.836
Look after yourself.
Don't fall overboard, okay?

29:30.860 --> 29:33.730
- More likely to jump.
- DiNozzo.

29:34.230 --> 29:35.366
Pa?

29:35.390 --> 29:37.570
You take care of yourself.

29:38.640 --> 29:40.800
Miss you, too, Dad.

29:43.110 --> 29:45.850
All right, got the e-mail.

29:49.390 --> 29:51.210
Oh, boy.

29:52.790 --> 29:55.196
Now we know what Vargo downloaded.

29:55.220 --> 29:58.946
It's the Joint Chiefs' battle plans
in the event of an attack on Israel.

29:58.970 --> 30:01.500
I'm going to have to brief SECNAV.

30:02.440 --> 30:04.146
McGee.

30:04.170 --> 30:08.806
Our ability to respond to any threat or attack
in the Middle East has been compromised.

30:08.830 --> 30:13.420
If this gets in the wrong hands, every
ship in the Gulf will be in danger.

30:13.740 --> 30:14.936
Found something.

30:14.960 --> 30:19.106
Agent Lee logged into the strategic planning
office at the same time every Friday,

30:19.130 --> 30:21.940
for a six-month period
prior to Vargo disappearing.

30:21.970 --> 30:24.916
Logged in at the same
time, logged out 30 minutes later.

30:24.940 --> 30:26.026
Like clockwork.

30:26.050 --> 30:28.510
She was meeting someone.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.920
I wasn't meeting Vargo.

30:34.350 --> 30:37.830
You logged in through
the service area.

30:38.170 --> 30:39.976
You never stayed
more than 30 minutes.

30:40.000 --> 30:41.576
I never even met Vargo.

30:41.600 --> 30:44.496
The first time I saw him was his
dead body at the trailer park.

30:44.520 --> 30:47.056
Then who were you
meeting in that building?

30:47.080 --> 30:48.736
Not Vargo.

30:48.760 --> 30:52.890
So you were meeting
someone, Agent Lee. Who?

30:53.800 --> 30:55.870
Who?

31:01.050 --> 31:03.760
Agent Gibbs. You startled me.

31:06.370 --> 31:08.666
- Director Vance.
- Mr. Palmer.

31:08.690 --> 31:11.790
You been seeing Agent Lee, Jimmy?

31:12.550 --> 31:14.780
No.

31:19.100 --> 31:21.836
Yes. I-I mean...
I mean, no. I mean...

31:21.860 --> 31:25.896
I mean, yes, I was seeing her, and
no, I'm not seeing her anymore.

31:25.920 --> 31:28.680
Where and when?

31:31.060 --> 31:34.150
Here... and there.

31:34.580 --> 31:37.130
Here and there. Mostly here.

31:37.480 --> 31:41.810
Until Dr. Mallard almost caught
us, and then, uh, we had to change our...

31:45.280 --> 31:47.866
- where we did it.
- Where?

31:47.890 --> 31:49.786
- Building next door.
- When?

31:49.810 --> 31:52.136
Every Friday morning.

31:52.160 --> 31:55.496
She'd log in, and then...

31:55.520 --> 32:01.270
she would open the, uh, service
door on the parking garage,

32:02.050 --> 32:04.796
and we used the paint
locker in the basement.

32:04.820 --> 32:07.216
Paint locker.

32:07.240 --> 32:08.636
Think she got off on the fumes.

32:08.660 --> 32:09.976
You still seeing her?

32:10.000 --> 32:11.896
No, sir. Ended a few months ago.

32:11.920 --> 32:13.726
She end it?

32:13.750 --> 32:15.646
No, I ended it.

32:15.670 --> 32:20.830
Sir. Felt I was... being used.

32:25.020 --> 32:27.510
Am I gonna be fired?

32:29.160 --> 32:31.986
No. And it will not happen again.

32:32.010 --> 32:36.520
No, sir. It will not happen.
With anyone. Anywhere.

32:36.890 --> 32:39.446
I... I... I mean, it will
happen again... it-it...

32:39.470 --> 32:45.360
but not with anyone here
on the, uh... Thank you. Sir.

32:47.050 --> 32:49.420
I got it, thanks.

32:51.380 --> 32:52.356
It was McGee.

32:52.380 --> 32:56.356
He found the report that Lee filed on the
anonymous calls she received from Vargo

32:56.380 --> 32:59.276
while she was in
the legal department.

32:59.300 --> 33:01.686
Just like she said.

33:01.710 --> 33:04.456
She's in the clear.

33:04.480 --> 33:07.260
One down, two to go.

33:08.240 --> 33:11.040
Langer or Keating.

33:18.000 --> 33:20.340
Someone want to tell
me what's going on?

33:21.860 --> 33:22.586
Anyone?

33:22.610 --> 33:24.446
Isn't it your turn to get the coffee?

33:24.470 --> 33:26.346
Someone's been running a
check on my bank records.

33:26.370 --> 33:27.376
Ex-wife?

33:27.400 --> 33:28.926
Internal. Cyber unit.

33:28.950 --> 33:29.766
How do you know?

33:29.790 --> 33:32.186
Little security program I wrote
to guard against identity theft.

33:32.210 --> 33:33.356
It just alerted me.

33:33.380 --> 33:34.436
They can't do that.

33:34.460 --> 33:36.276
It's illegal without a warrant.

33:36.300 --> 33:38.756
You might want to write a letter
to your congressman about that one.

33:38.780 --> 33:40.286
So should you.

33:40.310 --> 33:41.766
They've been through
your records, too.

33:41.790 --> 33:43.046
How do you know that?

33:43.070 --> 33:44.146
Because I checked.

33:44.170 --> 33:45.336
They've been through
your records as well.

33:45.360 --> 33:47.246
Yeah, I guessed that already.

33:47.270 --> 33:51.956
So someone in Cyber Unit is checking for
irregularities in agents' banking records?

33:51.980 --> 33:53.466
Not every agent.

33:53.490 --> 33:54.436
Just ours.

33:54.460 --> 33:58.270
"We few, we happy few.
We band of brothers.""

34:00.460 --> 34:03.170
Am I under investigation?

34:04.420 --> 34:05.196
Should you be?

34:05.220 --> 34:07.860
I'd like a straight yes or no, sir.

34:10.870 --> 34:12.025
- Keating.
- Sir?

34:12.050 --> 34:14.489
Interrogation Room, now.

34:16.639 --> 34:19.090
You stay on base.

34:22.540 --> 34:24.616
What the hell's going on?

34:24.639 --> 34:27.530
They think one of us is a spy.

34:29.550 --> 34:31.929
Somebody want to tell me...

34:35.170 --> 34:36.746
I have rights.

34:36.770 --> 34:37.906
What was that?

34:37.929 --> 34:39.866
I said that I have rights.

34:39.889 --> 34:42.275
Agent Gibbs, does he have rights?

34:42.300 --> 34:44.426
Yeah, he's got the
right to remain silent.

34:44.449 --> 34:47.206
Might make us think he's
got something to hide, though.

34:47.230 --> 34:50.106
These are impressive
computer skills, Daniel.

34:50.130 --> 34:54.110
MIT grad. Programming. Encryption.

34:54.400 --> 34:56.755
I bet there's not much you
don't know about computers.

34:56.780 --> 34:58.546
No. Sir.

34:58.570 --> 35:02.700
So tell me, you ever hacked
into the Pentagon's database?

35:03.450 --> 35:07.470
You might want to take a moment
before you answer that one.

35:08.290 --> 35:09.876
Computer stuff, right?

35:09.900 --> 35:12.400
Gotta be Keating.

35:19.720 --> 35:20.706
Brett, don't.

35:20.730 --> 35:22.266
Just looking.

35:22.290 --> 35:24.140
No.

35:32.650 --> 35:34.386
Wait.

35:34.410 --> 35:36.316
What?

35:36.340 --> 35:38.486
This is a military access card.

35:38.510 --> 35:41.006
Keating's a civilian like us.

35:41.030 --> 35:44.056
It's for the computer
archives in Building Three.

35:44.080 --> 35:45.386
Vargo's.

35:45.410 --> 35:46.586
This was evidence.

35:46.610 --> 35:48.176
He must have taken it
from the crime scene.

35:48.200 --> 35:49.896
And this looks like a password.

35:49.920 --> 35:51.226
We should tell Gibbs.

35:51.250 --> 35:53.436
Let's take a look first.

35:53.460 --> 35:55.256
No, Gibbs said not to
leave the building.

35:55.280 --> 35:56.946
No. He said the "base,"
not the building.

35:56.970 --> 35:58.346
You go then.

35:58.370 --> 36:01.920
I don't have access
to Building Three.

36:02.940 --> 36:05.530
But you do.

36:15.090 --> 36:16.766
No one home.

36:16.790 --> 36:19.450
No one ever is. It's
computer controlled.

36:49.610 --> 36:51.006
We shouldn't be here.

36:51.030 --> 36:54.220
If we get caught, they'll
think it's one of us.

37:07.780 --> 37:09.210
What?

37:12.280 --> 37:13.716
It's a simple question, Agent Keating.

37:13.740 --> 37:16.120
You've either met him or you haven't.

37:16.430 --> 37:19.400
Excuse me, Director Vance.
You need to hear this.

37:21.400 --> 37:24.246
We set up an alert system for all
of Vargo's electronic information:

37:24.270 --> 37:26.766
Credit cards, toll
cards, I.D... everything.

37:26.790 --> 37:29.466
If anyone tries to use them, the
system sends us an alert.

37:29.490 --> 37:30.586
It just did.

37:30.610 --> 37:36.370
Someone is using Vargo's access card to get into the
computer archive section in Building Three next door.

37:36.640 --> 37:39.880
- Gibbs! Gibbs! Gibbs!
- Lee?

37:41.350 --> 37:42.616
Oh, hell, it's Langer.

37:42.640 --> 37:44.490
You watch him.

37:49.790 --> 37:51.570
Agent Lee?

37:52.090 --> 37:54.250
Lee?

38:16.720 --> 38:18.410
I got it.

38:19.930 --> 38:22.080
It's okay.

38:24.710 --> 38:26.710
Gibbs.

38:33.200 --> 38:36.800
It was him. All the time.

38:37.180 --> 38:38.520
It was him.

38:39.320 --> 38:41.920
He's got Vargo's access card.

38:48.230 --> 38:50.126
Shalom alaikum, Eli.

38:50.150 --> 38:51.366
Leon Vance.

38:51.390 --> 38:53.566
Ah, Leon, shalom.

38:53.590 --> 38:55.486
It is good to hear your
voice again, my friend.

38:55.510 --> 38:56.786
How is your family?

38:56.810 --> 38:58.496
Complaining they
don't see enough of me.

38:58.520 --> 39:00.126
Ah, the work of intrigue, yes?

39:00.150 --> 39:02.906
It keeps us all away
from our loved ones, huh?

39:02.930 --> 39:03.996
Leon, thank you.

39:04.020 --> 39:06.836
Thank you for sending
my daughter home to me.

39:06.860 --> 39:10.416
Though I think you
perhaps had other motives?

39:10.440 --> 39:12.730
Ziva's greatly missed here.

39:13.280 --> 39:15.506
She has many friends.

39:15.530 --> 39:18.706
Yes, and many talents.

39:18.730 --> 39:20.496
You have a daughter?

39:20.520 --> 39:23.866
Yes. Yeah. Kayla.

39:23.890 --> 39:28.726
You know, Leon, sometimes those
who know ask me directly.

39:28.750 --> 39:30.026
The brave among them.

39:30.050 --> 39:31.476
But most of the time, the others,

39:31.500 --> 39:35.336
I can feel them looking at
me and silently wondering

39:35.360 --> 39:40.356
how can a father possibly raise his
daughter to be a professional killer.

39:40.380 --> 39:43.696
A question that I've never asked
you, because I know the answer.

39:43.720 --> 39:45.876
Every day is a fight to survive.

39:45.900 --> 39:51.196
It is my dream that my daughter will not have to
make that decision with her sons and her daughters.

39:51.220 --> 39:56.430
I would like my grandchildren to be doctors
and architects, to live a happy life.

39:56.830 --> 40:00.300
To grow fat... and old.

40:03.700 --> 40:06.156
You want her back, don't you?

40:06.180 --> 40:08.966
Yes, Eli, I want her back.

40:08.990 --> 40:12.290
Tell me, Leon, are we winning?

40:17.390 --> 40:19.796
I don't know, Eli.

40:19.820 --> 40:23.740
I like to think we are. And then...

40:25.010 --> 40:28.850
there's something else: A
bomb, a kidnapping, an atrocity.

40:30.590 --> 40:33.746
Use her well, Leon.

40:33.770 --> 40:38.200
Ziva is the sharp end of the spear.

40:39.090 --> 40:40.556
Thank you, Eli.

40:40.580 --> 40:41.796
Shalom, my friend.

40:41.820 --> 40:43.830
Shalom to you.

41:06.350 --> 41:08.230
- Done.
- Done.

41:09.100 --> 41:14.156
Look... I know you never thought
much of me as a field agent.

41:14.180 --> 41:17.606
You probably never thought
much of me as a lawyer.

41:17.630 --> 41:19.906
Oh, that's more the
profession than the person.

41:19.930 --> 41:22.540
But if you ever need... I mean...

41:22.930 --> 41:26.440
If the chance ever comes up again...

41:31.110 --> 41:33.520
Might be important.

41:34.780 --> 41:37.210
It can wait.

41:40.530 --> 41:43.220
- I got it.
- Thank you.

41:47.880 --> 41:49.846
Do we know why he did it?

41:49.870 --> 41:52.380
Money... probably.

41:53.260 --> 41:57.860
Well, thanks. Be seeing you.

42:00.470 --> 42:03.656
Yay! Oh, my God, I'm so excited.

42:03.680 --> 42:06.540
McGee, I can't believe it. Pinch me.

42:07.470 --> 42:09.300
Thank you.

42:19.380 --> 42:20.866
Michelle.

42:20.890 --> 42:24.050
There she is! Ziva!

42:25.880 --> 42:27.486
Welcome back.

42:27.510 --> 42:30.080
It's good to be back.

42:30.710 --> 42:33.970
You're back! You're back! Yay!

42:34.980 --> 42:37.520
- Hey, Ziva!
- Hi, McGee.

42:48.670 --> 42:50.220
Do they suspect?

43:02.190 --> 43:04.000
No
