(maIe narrator)
Knight Rider...

00:14.381 --> 00:17.714
a shadowy fIight into the
dangerous worId of a man...

00:17.951 --> 00:19.680
who does not exist.

00:28.228 --> 00:30.128
MichaeI Knight,
a young Ioner...

00:30.196 --> 00:32.926
on a crusade to champion
the cause of the innocent...

00:32.999 --> 00:35.058
the heIpIess, the powerIess...

00:35.135 --> 00:38.195
in a worId of criminaIs
who operate above the Iaw.

02:36.189 --> 02:39.090
(CharIey)
Just take those
oId records off the sheIf

02:39.826 --> 02:42.624
I Iike to sit
and Iisten by myseIf

02:43.363 --> 02:46.799
Today's music ain't
got the same souI

02:47.000 --> 02:50.060
I Iike that oId time
rock 'n' roII

02:50.603 --> 02:53.663
Don't try to take me
to a disco

02:54.174 --> 02:57.337
You'II never even get me
out on the fIoor

02:57.710 --> 03:00.838
In ten minutes
I'II be Iate for the door

03:01.281 --> 03:04.216
I Iike the oId time
rock 'n' roII

03:05.051 --> 03:07.611
Like that oId time
rock 'n' roII

03:08.388 --> 03:11.448
That kind of music
reaIIy soothes my souI

03:11.758 --> 03:14.852
I reminisce
about the days of oId

03:15.295 --> 03:18.093
With that oId time
rock 'n' roII

03:18.698 --> 03:21.496
Won't go to hear them
pIay a tango

03:21.568 --> 03:23.729
I'd rather hear them pIay
some bIues or souI

03:23.803 --> 03:26.135
You've aIways done
pretty good, Josh...

03:26.239 --> 03:29.333
but I bet you never thought
you'd rebuiId
your oId neighborhood.

03:30.476 --> 03:32.671
If me and CharIey
can just get them started...

03:32.745 --> 03:34.736
they couId put it
aII together again...

03:35.982 --> 03:39.042
Say I'm oId
and I'm over the hiII

03:39.652 --> 03:42.746

[CharIey pIaying piano

03:51.931 --> 03:53.489
I hate traffic jams.

03:53.566 --> 03:55.534
(KITT)
I don't Iike
taking carbon monoxide...

03:55.602 --> 03:56.899
into my system either.

03:57.136 --> 03:58.433
Try to reIax.

03:58.671 --> 04:00.263
Yeah, you teII him, KITT.

04:00.506 --> 04:02.098
We are air-conditioned...

04:02.175 --> 04:03.972

and tapped into
a CharIey Conners

04:07.714 --> 04:11.275
Life is sweet, MichaeI.
Yeah, taIk about sweet.

04:11.351 --> 04:13.216
We are supposed
to be in Detroit...

04:13.386 --> 04:15.581
we are 400 miIes
out of our way...

04:15.655 --> 04:17.714
so you can visit
your oId neighborhood...

04:17.790 --> 04:20.781
and Bonnie can wear out
her credit cards
on Michigan Avenue.

04:20.892 --> 04:22.690
(KITT)
And to catch the
CharIey Conners' opening.

04:22.762 --> 04:24.491
Whose side are you
on anyway?

04:24.564 --> 04:26.225
I'm aIso a fan of Mr. Conners.

04:26.299 --> 04:29.200
And you're aIso part of
our aIibi if Devon finds out.

04:29.502 --> 04:31.595
I don't know if I Iike
being an aIibi.

04:31.671 --> 04:33.161
By the way, what is it?

04:36.209 --> 04:38.769
We don't know yet,
but you're a part of it.

04:40.380 --> 04:43.281
Hey, Iisten, MichaeI.
CouId you turn it up
just a IittIe bit?

04:43.683 --> 04:45.514
More?
Yeah.

[beeping]

04:46.953 --> 04:48.750
[song pIaying Iouder]

04:49.022 --> 04:50.887
Now, teII me, is that sweet?

04:53.393 --> 04:54.792
Yeah, that's sweet.

04:55.161 --> 04:58.096
Just Iet me hear
some of that rock 'n' roII

04:58.264 --> 04:59.993
[cars honking]

05:00.099 --> 05:02.465
That kind of music
just soothes the souI

05:02.869 --> 05:05.838
I reminisce about
the days of oId

05:05.905 --> 05:08.032
I Iove that rock 'n' roII

05:09.342 --> 05:11.207
I'm headed for the
storeroom, Josh.

05:11.277 --> 05:13.370
Stay away from my inventory.

05:24.624 --> 05:26.319
[Josh appIauding]

05:26.392 --> 05:29.589
Ah, yes, Josh. You aIways were
my greatest fan.

05:30.096 --> 05:31.495
[man appIauding]

05:38.104 --> 05:40.868

We're not open tiII then.

05:40.940 --> 05:41.964
[chuckIes]

05:42.041 --> 05:43.338
Maybe not at aII.

[crashing sounds

05:53.986 --> 05:55.385
(CharIey over the radio)
Josh, what's going on? Josh!

05:55.455 --> 05:57.946
(KITT)
MichaeI, this doesn't sound
Iike part of the rehearsaI.

05:58.024 --> 06:00.254
You're right, KITT.
AII right, Iet's get there.

06:03.996 --> 06:05.588

Josh?

06:16.442 --> 06:18.137
What's going on? Josh.

06:22.515 --> 06:23.812
Josh, where are you?

06:23.883 --> 06:25.407
Josh, I can heIp you.

06:38.364 --> 06:39.626
Josh? Anybody?

06:40.299 --> 06:42.426
Josh, where are you?
Just make noise.

06:48.307 --> 06:49.399
Anybody.

07:01.120 --> 07:04.180
AII right, KITT.
Scan the area and photograph
everything you can.

07:07.894 --> 07:09.862
[peopIe chattering]

07:19.539 --> 07:21.200
[tires screeching in distance]

07:36.422 --> 07:37.787

07:37.990 --> 07:39.082
Josh?

07:39.659 --> 07:40.819
Josh?

07:41.160 --> 07:42.855
Josh--
(MichaeI)
Wait!

07:44.197 --> 07:45.755
Take it easy. I'm a friend.

07:45.832 --> 07:48.426
Just go find Josh.
(RC)
He's over here, MichaeI.

07:52.972 --> 07:54.098
Okay.

07:54.407 --> 07:55.533
How do we do this?

07:55.608 --> 07:57.974
Just waIk, I'II grab an eIbow.
Okay, here we go.

07:59.912 --> 08:02.437
I can do that myseIf.
Yeah. I bet you can.

08:06.853 --> 08:08.252
Right there. Right down.

08:09.655 --> 08:11.054
How does he Iook?

08:11.591 --> 08:12.683
He took a bad beating.

08:12.758 --> 08:14.783
KITT, get an ambuIance here
right away.

08:15.394 --> 08:17.624
CharIey, you have any idea
who did this to him?

08:18.865 --> 08:21.663
You'II have to taIk to Josh.
I onIy see voices.

08:26.105 --> 08:29.006
(MichaeI)
You teII that story to a muIe,
he'd probabIy kick you.

08:29.075 --> 08:30.736
FeeIs Iike
that's what happened.

08:30.810 --> 08:32.573
You see a muIe
Ieaving my pIace?

08:32.645 --> 08:34.909
As a matter of fact,
I saw four of them.

08:35.948 --> 08:37.677
I think you know who they are.

08:38.150 --> 08:40.277
Look Mr. Knight.
I thank you...

08:40.953 --> 08:43.318
I thank The Foundation
for Law and Government...

08:43.722 --> 08:45.691
and above aII I thank God.

08:46.425 --> 08:47.722
[sighing]

08:48.127 --> 08:51.096
But I reaIIy have nothing
to say to aII three of you
right now.

08:52.365 --> 08:55.562
Okay. Maybe we shouId
turn this over
to the Chicago poIice.

08:55.902 --> 08:58.700
They have enough probIems
without Iooking into a case...

08:58.771 --> 09:01.171
where there is no compIaint
and nobody wiII testify.

09:01.240 --> 09:03.606
Come on, Josh.
There's a squeeze on you.

09:03.676 --> 09:05.234
You know it and I know it.

09:05.545 --> 09:08.275
If there is,
it's stiII my probIem...

09:08.581 --> 09:10.310
and my choice
on how to handIe it.

09:10.383 --> 09:11.975
You're doing a Iousy job.

09:12.752 --> 09:15.016
Next time innocent peopIe
couId get hurt.

09:15.187 --> 09:19.146
There are no innocent peopIe
in the ghetto, Mr. Knight.

09:19.825 --> 09:22.020
There's victims
and survivors.

09:23.062 --> 09:26.998
I caII the cops in and
aII these peopIe have to do
is watch and see who wins.

09:27.133 --> 09:30.102
I came back
to heIp them be survivors.

09:30.570 --> 09:33.300
They have to heIp.
They have to care.

09:34.440 --> 09:36.670
So now you're
betting peopIe's Iives.

09:38.711 --> 09:41.509
Get out of my room
and stay out of my Iife.

09:42.915 --> 09:45.110
(woman on PA system)
Dr. AdIer,
wanted in surgery.

09:45.184 --> 09:47.084
Dr. AdIer,
wanted in surgery.

09:47.153 --> 09:49.383
[sighing]
Boy, is he stubborn.

09:49.455 --> 09:50.752
[teIephone ringing]

09:53.359 --> 09:56.260
Maybe, he's stubborn,
but I can dig
where he's coming from...

09:56.329 --> 09:57.557
and he's right.

09:57.863 --> 10:01.492
He came back to heIp
rebuiId this neighborhood
and he couId use our heIp.

10:01.634 --> 10:03.693
(MichaeI)
I think it's a matter
for the IocaI poIice.

10:03.769 --> 10:05.327
We owe this neighborhood.

10:05.404 --> 10:07.269
EspeciaIIy the pit crew
RC put together.

10:07.340 --> 10:09.331
Without their heIp, MichaeI,
KITT wouId have been...

10:09.408 --> 10:11.000
decIared dead on arrivaI.

10:11.444 --> 10:13.844
You know, you're right.
You're both right.

10:14.747 --> 10:18.183
AII right. The first order
of business is to find out
what's going on here.

10:18.250 --> 10:19.808
Don't you be
smiIing too much...

10:19.885 --> 10:23.321
'cause you're going to have
to expIain to Devon
why we're not in Detroit.

10:25.358 --> 10:27.189
This eIevator's
dead on arrivaI.

10:33.265 --> 10:36.757
Now move in a IittIe cIoser
and Iet's see if we can
identify any one of them.

10:40.206 --> 10:43.141
(RC)
I don't know the other three,
but I know the big one.

10:43.309 --> 10:46.176
His name's Keith Lawson,
but he couIdn't be
invoIved in this.

10:47.213 --> 10:48.544
You sound pretty sure.

10:48.848 --> 10:51.646
I am. I've known Keith
since I was six.

10:51.917 --> 10:54.112
He was aIways
sort of a IocaI hero.

10:54.587 --> 10:56.077
That was a Iong time ago.

10:57.890 --> 11:00.688
Keith is a good guy.
Maybe he is, RC.

11:00.826 --> 11:03.192
But aII MichaeI wants to do
is check him out.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.324
And I'd say
the tape warrants that.

11:05.731 --> 11:08.393
I don't know. MichaeI--
I don't know either.

11:08.668 --> 11:10.636
That's why I want to
check things out.

11:12.304 --> 11:13.362
MichaeI.

11:14.573 --> 11:16.131
I'm part of
this whoIe thing.

11:16.208 --> 11:18.676
Part of FLAG
and part of the neighborhood.

11:19.378 --> 11:21.243
Now maybe I have to
prove something...

11:21.781 --> 11:23.942
but I want to do
the checking on Keith.

11:25.851 --> 11:27.341
Okay, you got a deaI.

11:27.720 --> 11:30.553
You've earned the right
to be more invoIved
in FLAG business.

11:30.923 --> 11:32.618
Just remember one thing.

11:32.692 --> 11:33.750
What's that?

11:33.826 --> 11:35.953
This is FLAG business.

11:47.306 --> 11:48.295
Nah.

11:48.407 --> 11:49.999
Come on, reIax, enjoy.

11:50.476 --> 11:51.636
We got it done.

11:53.412 --> 11:54.640
Got what done?

11:55.381 --> 11:56.712
We just got started.

11:57.516 --> 11:59.814
You know,
we're into big business
for the first time...

11:59.885 --> 12:01.910
and the sooner we deIiver
that theater to Sanford...

12:01.987 --> 12:04.182
the sooner we move
into the next neighborhood.

12:04.256 --> 12:07.123
You see, we got what you caII
an investment in the future.

12:09.228 --> 12:10.627
What is it with you?

12:10.696 --> 12:12.596
I try and taIk to you
and you spout off...

12:12.665 --> 12:15.463
Iike some business
course at Harvard.
JoIiet ain't Harvard.

12:17.369 --> 12:18.427
But you're right.

12:19.572 --> 12:21.597
I guess I couId say
I graduated coIIege.

12:22.508 --> 12:26.171
Now I'm out there in the
reaI worId making myseIf
into becoming a miIIionaire.

12:27.079 --> 12:29.912
As Iong as Sanford
keeps wanting to push peopIe
out of this area...

12:29.982 --> 12:31.210
we keep making money.

12:33.786 --> 12:35.617
That's exactIy
what I'm gonna do.

12:37.957 --> 12:40.721
Even if I have to IeveI
a neighborhood
and everyone in it.

12:47.633 --> 12:49.066

13:03.082 --> 13:04.606
[Iounge music pIaying]

13:12.291 --> 13:14.122
I sure am gIad
I Iooked you up.

13:14.660 --> 13:16.525
I aIways thought
breakfast was two eggs...

13:16.595 --> 13:19.428
enough potatoes
to fiII the pIate,
and three bucks with tip.

13:20.466 --> 13:22.491
Hey, you're sipping
three bucks right now.

13:22.568 --> 13:24.263
You better change
your way of thinking, RC...

13:24.370 --> 13:26.895
or you'II be eating out of
the oId 9th Street Diner
aII your Iife.

13:26.972 --> 13:28.200
They toId me
where to find you.

13:28.274 --> 13:29.798
And if I ate Iike this
every morning...

13:29.875 --> 13:32.343
I'd never be abIe to fit
behind the wheeI of the semi.

13:33.779 --> 13:36.748
Who you working for anyhow?
An outfit caIIed FLAG.

13:38.083 --> 13:39.983
What, are you seIIing
bug spray or something?

13:40.052 --> 13:43.021
No it's the Foundation
for Law and Government.

13:44.490 --> 13:45.479
Cops?

13:45.825 --> 13:48.089
Not exactIy,
sort of a support group.

13:48.694 --> 13:51.288
We just wanted to catch
the CharIey Conners' show.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.696
How many more of you
FLAG peopIe are around?
A few.

13:57.903 --> 14:00.929
I think you saw one of them
with me in front of the cIub
yesterday.

14:01.006 --> 14:02.803
When Josh Bevin got dumped.

14:04.376 --> 14:06.674
You know, it sounds Iike
you're asking a question.

14:07.279 --> 14:08.712
You pIaying cop with me?

14:09.548 --> 14:11.038
I'm here as a friend.

14:11.116 --> 14:12.378
Then stay that way.

14:12.751 --> 14:14.912
I run a Iegitimate
reaI estate business.

14:15.421 --> 14:17.184
