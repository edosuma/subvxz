00:24.258 --> 00:27.059
You're seriously
not gonna say anything?

00:27.061 --> 00:29.328
What do you want me to say?
I already said I was sorry.

00:29.330 --> 00:31.163
Well, sorry isn't enough!

00:31.866 --> 00:34.400
Then what would be enough, huh?

00:34.402 --> 00:35.501
You know what?

00:35.503 --> 00:36.735
Forget it.

00:48.015 --> 00:49.381
Look, I don't wanna fight.
Okay?

00:49.383 --> 00:51.884
Can you just tell me
what you want me to do?

00:51.886 --> 00:54.353
What? You honestly
don't know what to do?!

00:54.355 --> 00:55.587
If I honestly knew,

00:55.589 --> 00:58.524
I wouldn't have
just asked you right now!

01:01.729 --> 01:05.096
I asked you 20 minutes
ago to stop for directions.

01:05.099 --> 01:07.366
And I already told you
I know where I'm going.

01:07.368 --> 01:08.967
I just wanna go home.

01:08.969 --> 01:10.702
I know.

01:12.273 --> 01:13.939
Shit.

01:15.910 --> 01:17.176
What did you do?

01:17.178 --> 01:19.011
I didn't do anything.

01:20.181 --> 01:22.081
Jesus, George,
you have to be kidding me

01:22.083 --> 01:23.782
We are in the middle of nowhere.

01:23.784 --> 01:27.186
Thank you, Carla. Thank you
for telling me the obvious.

01:27.188 --> 01:28.687
This is so typical.

01:30.224 --> 01:32.024
Look. It was a mistake, okay?

01:32.026 --> 01:34.293
I forgot, you don't make those,
do you?

01:34.295 --> 01:36.061
That is so unfair!

01:37.098 --> 01:38.464
Look. I don't want to fight.

01:38.466 --> 01:40.566
I don't want to fight either.
I just wanna go home.

01:41.669 --> 01:43.702
What was that?!
- I don't know.

01:43.704 --> 01:45.771
- Mommy!
- George, wait.

01:45.773 --> 01:48.841
- Mommy? Daddy?
- Wait. I'm scared.

01:49.910 --> 01:52.311
Hey, every-everything's okay.

01:52.313 --> 01:53.645
Did you have a good birthday?

01:53.647 --> 01:55.681
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

01:56.817 --> 01:58.550
Okay, okay.
Just stay in the car.

01:58.552 --> 02:00.018
Stay in the car.

02:00.688 --> 02:01.753
Be careful!

02:06.560 --> 02:08.227
Hey, it's okay.

02:08.229 --> 02:10.095
It's okay, it's okay, honey.

02:10.097 --> 02:11.396
Don't worry.

02:21.408 --> 02:22.641
What'd you see?
What is it?

02:22.643 --> 02:24.309
Did you see anything?!
- No!

02:24.311 --> 02:25.878
Daddy?

02:43.964 --> 02:44.964
Oh, my God!

02:48.802 --> 02:50.335
Give me the flashlight
outta the glovebox!

02:50.337 --> 02:51.503
- Okay. Okay.
- Now! Come on!

02:51.505 --> 02:52.671
Here! Here!

02:55.843 --> 02:57.309
Oh, my God!

02:59.914 --> 03:01.280
George!

03:49.063 --> 03:50.495
Oh, my God.

03:55.135 --> 03:56.568
Oh, my God.

03:57.838 --> 03:59.404
I'm sorry!

03:59.406 --> 04:01.907
Oh, God!

04:01.909 --> 04:04.876
Come on! Come on!

04:18.692 --> 04:20.358
Mom!

04:23.964 --> 04:25.464
Mommy!

04:28.936 --> 04:31.336
Mommy!

04:35.409 --> 04:37.409
Mom!

04:39.947 --> 04:42.080
Mommy.

07:51.505 --> 07:52.771
Ah...

07:53.106 --> 07:54.439
Wait...

07:54.441 --> 07:56.208
Maybe we shouldn't, you know...

08:00.214 --> 08:01.546
Okay.

08:47.995 --> 08:49.761
So now do I get an A?

08:51.198 --> 08:53.265
That was clearly
a B performance.

08:55.102 --> 08:56.268
Ah!

08:56.270 --> 08:57.769
Get dressed.

08:59.273 --> 09:00.405
Kidding!

09:08.348 --> 09:10.482
Oh, my God.
Thank you.

09:13.220 --> 09:15.387
You could give it a chance.

09:15.389 --> 09:16.688
I'll tell you what.

09:17.424 --> 09:19.724
I'll give country music a chance

09:19.726 --> 09:21.359
if you let me get out

09:21.361 --> 09:24.930
of doing this year's
lame finals project.

09:26.433 --> 09:28.667
You know I can't give you
special treatment.

09:37.177 --> 09:40.512
I'm sorry. I know you
hate it when I touch it.

09:40.514 --> 09:42.047
I don't hate it, just...

09:43.450 --> 09:45.784
I dunno, I-I can't explain it.

09:45.786 --> 09:48.186
It's okay. I get it.

09:56.296 --> 09:57.629
What's this?

09:58.265 --> 09:59.698
Happy birthday.

10:01.068 --> 10:02.867
My birthday's not 'til tomorrow.

10:02.869 --> 10:04.869
I know, I just...
I couldn't wait.

10:07.107 --> 10:08.540
Thank you.

10:10.177 --> 10:12.410
Wait, maybe you should
open it tomorrow.

10:14.581 --> 10:16.314
Okay...

10:16.316 --> 10:17.482
Sure?

10:17.484 --> 10:18.817
Mmh.

10:20.887 --> 10:22.354
Are you disappointed?

10:24.758 --> 10:26.658
Oh, you never disappoint.

10:39.272 --> 10:40.905
Shit!
- She's such a buzzkill!

10:40.907 --> 10:42.627
Kennedy!

10:44.645 --> 10:47.312
Kennedy, open the door!

10:47.314 --> 10:49.748
- Uh...
- Come on!

10:51.218 --> 10:53.418
I can hear you in there!

10:54.021 --> 10:55.654
I'm a little busy!

10:56.556 --> 10:59.024
Fuck you!
It's my room, too!

11:00.661 --> 11:02.694
I need my charger!

11:07.000 --> 11:08.366
Come on!

11:08.835 --> 11:10.402
Kennedy!

11:10.404 --> 11:11.404
What?

11:13.140 --> 11:15.040
What the fuck?!

11:21.415 --> 11:23.815
What the hell were you doing
in there?

11:23.817 --> 11:25.450
None of your business.

11:39.466 --> 11:40.965
Fuck me.

11:40.967 --> 11:42.233
What?

11:42.235 --> 11:43.635
Check your email.

11:53.613 --> 11:56.848
Like it's not bad enough that
we're stuck rooming together.

11:58.819 --> 12:00.518
Noah Russell?!

12:01.221 --> 12:02.721
I know.

12:02.723 --> 12:05.590
He's so... aspy.

12:07.527 --> 12:09.447
And we don't even have a fourth.

12:11.965 --> 12:13.398
I'll take care of that.

12:38.058 --> 12:39.390
Why am I here?

12:40.927 --> 12:43.128
We need to talk
about the project.

12:43.130 --> 12:45.730
And that required me
being seen...

12:45.732 --> 12:46.798
here?

12:48.034 --> 12:50.935
I have an A in that class
because I've worked my ass off.

12:50.937 --> 12:53.505
I'm not about to throw it away.
You need to step it up.

12:53.507 --> 12:55.740
You're so dramatic.

12:55.742 --> 12:57.442
Can't you, like,
do a little spell or something

12:57.444 --> 12:59.043
and get us an A?

12:59.579 --> 13:00.745
If I could do spells

13:00.747 --> 13:03.047
don't you think I'd have
a different roommate?

13:04.684 --> 13:06.151
Ha.

13:09.322 --> 13:11.556
Aw, that's really cute.

13:11.558 --> 13:13.358
You're pretending
like you have friends.

13:13.360 --> 13:15.126
I'm texting Noah.

13:15.128 --> 13:16.628
Oh, my God. Ew.

13:16.630 --> 13:18.363
Are you guys, like...

13:18.365 --> 13:20.932
No.
To see if he's coming.

13:22.302 --> 13:24.669
Hey, buddy, how you doin'?
Can I see your ID, please?

13:26.840 --> 13:28.873
All right. Good to go.
Thanks, man.

13:46.059 --> 13:47.225
What?

13:47.227 --> 13:49.627
Sorry, hi.
I'm Noah.

13:49.629 --> 13:51.296
I'm in your guys' group.

13:51.298 --> 13:53.398
Yeah, I know who you are, Noah.

13:53.400 --> 13:55.033
I just texted you.

13:55.035 --> 13:56.301
Right.

13:58.171 --> 13:59.437
Oh, hi.

14:12.519 --> 14:14.986
Oh, did you guys come together?

14:14.988 --> 14:16.588
No.

14:20.427 --> 14:21.759
All right, look.

14:21.761 --> 14:23.127
Since there's only three of us,

14:23.129 --> 14:25.563
we're all gonna have to
step it up.

14:25.565 --> 14:28.766
I already told you,
I took care of it.

14:28.768 --> 14:29.934
Who?

14:32.038 --> 14:33.771
Mr. Cooper!

14:33.773 --> 14:35.139
Hey, Noah.

14:36.443 --> 14:38.042
Our TA?

14:38.044 --> 14:39.811
Seriously?

14:41.781 --> 14:43.448
Hi, Mr. Cooper.

14:46.686 --> 14:48.686
Well, uh, looks like
we have our group.

14:48.688 --> 14:50.822
Now we just need a topic.

14:51.424 --> 14:53.057
Hold that thought.

14:53.059 --> 14:54.425
I need a drink.

15:09.876 --> 15:11.542
Making up
for your lack of knowledge

15:11.544 --> 15:13.945
about worldly events.

15:14.681 --> 15:16.981
Well, hello...
- Hello.

15:16.983 --> 15:18.116
Stranger.

15:19.586 --> 15:21.085
What can you recommend?

15:21.087 --> 15:23.221
Well, I guess depends
on how bad it is.

15:25.959 --> 15:27.725
It's pretty bad.

15:28.395 --> 15:30.161
I might not make it.

15:30.163 --> 15:31.443
What's serious?
Do you need help?

15:33.767 --> 15:35.099
I see.

15:35.101 --> 15:36.634
Something for the pain, then.

15:36.636 --> 15:39.203
- Please.
- So, what are you drinking?

15:41.374 --> 15:44.375
I'm not much of a drinker,
but...

15:44.377 --> 15:46.411
maybe we could each...

15:46.413 --> 15:48.346
get something and then...

15:48.348 --> 15:49.814
try 'em both.

15:58.258 --> 16:00.992
From opposite sides
of the glass, of course.

16:03.797 --> 16:05.697
I mean, of course.

16:05.699 --> 16:07.498
Germs and...

16:08.168 --> 16:09.400
all.

16:11.137 --> 16:14.405
Uh, why don't I just leave
you two to... figure it out?

16:14.407 --> 16:16.341
Uh, you know what?

16:16.343 --> 16:17.842
Noah, why don't you go and see

16:17.844 --> 16:20.712
if Ethan and Kennedy
are prepared, and, um...

16:20.714 --> 16:22.674
I'll just be there in a minute.

16:24.017 --> 16:25.283
Oh...

16:26.686 --> 16:27.785
Okay.

16:28.855 --> 16:30.054
Thanks.

16:36.963 --> 16:38.580
Wow.

16:38.581 --> 16:40.198
So, you were about to suggest
something to ease the pain?

16:40.200 --> 16:42.133
Well... that was
before I realized

16:42.135 --> 16:43.901
how serious it was.

16:44.637 --> 16:46.504
Uh...

16:46.506 --> 16:49.040
I think you need something
a little stronger.

16:49.042 --> 16:50.475
- Yeah.
- Maybe a gun.

16:53.079 --> 16:54.746
Yeah, maybe.

17:00.854 --> 17:02.987
Jade wants us
to talk about the project.

17:02.989 --> 17:04.489
Where is she?

17:04.491 --> 17:06.391
Let's just focus on the project.

17:06.393 --> 17:09.292
I don't even understand
what this project is.

17:09.295 --> 17:11.529
No problem.
I made copies...

17:11.531 --> 17:12.896
of the assignments.

17:16.002 --> 17:18.202
Oh... thanks.

17:18.204 --> 17:19.804
You're welcome, Mr. Cooper.

17:25.545 --> 17:26.625
You should feel lucky.

17:27.646 --> 17:30.314
I don't whip out this many
ingredients just for anybody.

17:40.760 --> 17:42.093
That's good.

17:43.663 --> 17:45.430
That's really good.

17:45.432 --> 17:46.432
Mm-hmm.

17:48.001 --> 17:49.921
You gonna tell me what's in it?

17:50.870 --> 17:52.136
Not tonight.

17:53.706 --> 17:55.039
Why not?

17:55.041 --> 17:56.808
Because you're being paged.

18:05.185 --> 18:07.385
I really wish I didn't care
about my grades.

18:07.387 --> 18:10.388
Yeah, but then the way you look
would make a lot more sense,

18:10.390 --> 18:12.350
and what's interesting
about that?

18:14.494 --> 18:16.227
So you like mystery?

18:17.097 --> 18:19.230
More of an onion enthusiast,
really.

18:21.367 --> 18:23.935
Layer. I like layers.

18:23.937 --> 18:25.269
Oh.

18:25.271 --> 18:26.904
So you like layers.

18:26.906 --> 18:30.141
Yes, and pulling
them off slowly.

18:32.011 --> 18:35.513
Real... slowly.

18:36.916 --> 18:39.016
Well then, to be continued.

18:39.018 --> 18:40.318
If I'm right.

18:41.588 --> 18:42.954
Right about what?

18:42.956 --> 18:45.923
Well, that you find
my cocktail irresistible.

19:04.043 --> 19:06.477
That was disgusting.

19:06.479 --> 19:09.247
People like you
should not be breeders.

19:13.353 --> 19:14.352
All right, so like it says here,

19:14.354 --> 19:16.020
the final requires us
to go into the field

19:16.022 --> 19:17.955
and study a chosen
myth or legend.

19:17.957 --> 19:21.325
Okay, so we just need to come up
with a good topic to explore.

19:21.327 --> 19:23.161
I took the liberty
of researching

19:23.163 --> 19:25.296
some urban legends around here.

19:25.298 --> 19:27.565
Whoa, check out Wonder Boy
over here.

19:30.370 --> 19:32.436
That's great, Noah.
Thank you.

19:43.149 --> 19:46.384
So, here's one about
The Charred Man of Creek Road.

19:48.021 --> 19:50.688
He hides under the bridge
and comes out...

19:50.690 --> 19:55.326
and stares at you with his
hollow, burnt-out sockets.

20:00.600 --> 20:02.200
Are you even paying attention?

20:02.202 --> 20:04.802
Relax! I heard you.

20:04.804 --> 20:06.404
And that's a little gross.

20:06.406 --> 20:09.807
Can't we do something
a little less creepy?

20:09.809 --> 20:12.977
We're not gonna find a story
about flying pixies.

20:12.979 --> 20:15.079
Oh, this one's in Joshua Tree.

20:16.182 --> 20:18.082
Isn't that where you're from?

20:18.084 --> 20:19.984
Locals dubbed it The Rake

20:19.986 --> 20:21.986
because of its extraordinarily
long fingers

20:21.988 --> 20:24.355
and nails like claws.

20:24.357 --> 20:25.957
Ew!

20:28.895 --> 20:30.194
Whoa.

20:31.030 --> 20:32.096
What?

20:32.699 --> 20:34.859
It says here it only happens
on the Equinox.

20:36.569 --> 20:39.503
Oh, that's when the day and night
are exactly the same length.

20:39.505 --> 20:40.871
Why does that matter?

20:41.641 --> 20:43.174
'Cause it's tomorrow.

20:44.510 --> 20:46.210
Oh, my God.
That's your birthday.

20:46.212 --> 20:47.612
Weird.

20:49.515 --> 20:51.882
Well, I vote we do this one.

20:51.884 --> 20:53.317
I agree.

20:53.319 --> 20:54.619
You would.

20:55.054 --> 20:56.387
What do you mean?

20:56.389 --> 20:57.788
Never mind.

21:07.333 --> 21:09.700
Uh... can I help you?

21:12.338 --> 21:13.871
Who are you?

21:14.207 --> 21:15.406
Cute bag.

21:15.408 --> 21:17.808
I'm Kelly! Thanks!

21:17.810 --> 21:19.277
Does Mom know you're here?

21:19.279 --> 21:22.513
Mom? She's your sister?

21:22.515 --> 21:23.781
Yes.

21:23.783 --> 21:24.982
Adopted?

21:24.984 --> 21:26.217
- No.
- No.

21:26.219 --> 21:28.819
Oh... I get it.

21:28.821 --> 21:29.987
What?

21:30.490 --> 21:32.056
Jade, Kelly.

21:32.892 --> 21:34.972
Your parents really like
the color green.

21:37.163 --> 21:40.064
Noah, I-I don't think it has
anything to do with that.

21:40.066 --> 21:43.934
No, actually, it's everything
to do with that.

21:43.936 --> 21:45.536
It's our cross to bear.

21:45.538 --> 21:48.005
They only eat the green M&Ms.

21:48.007 --> 21:49.340
How did you find me?

21:49.342 --> 21:52.276
You know there's an app
for that, right?

21:52.278 --> 21:53.844
How did you get in the bar?

22:01.954 --> 22:03.421
Well...

22:03.823 --> 22:05.623
Mr. Cooper...

22:05.625 --> 22:06.991
I trust you'll make
the right decision

22:06.993 --> 22:08.459
for our project.

22:09.495 --> 22:11.562
You... come with me.

22:26.479 --> 22:27.645
So, you just took the bus?

22:27.647 --> 22:29.780
You don't know
what they're like.

22:29.782 --> 22:31.282
Kelly, I'm the only other person

22:31.284 --> 22:32.683
who does know what they're like.

22:32.685 --> 22:35.386
It's just so much harder
now that you're gone.

22:35.388 --> 22:37.788
They treat me like I'm a baby.

22:38.658 --> 22:41.025
Just let me stay.

22:41.027 --> 22:42.293
Please.

22:44.430 --> 22:46.263
I can't do that.

22:47.166 --> 22:48.466
Mom and Dad'll be worried,

22:48.468 --> 22:50.067
and we're leaving tomorrow.

22:50.069 --> 22:52.503
Well, let me come!
It sounds fun!

22:52.505 --> 22:54.071
No way.

22:54.073 --> 22:55.840
What if I don't bother you?

22:56.943 --> 22:58.776
I'll hang out with Kennedy.

22:58.778 --> 23:00.845
Um... hell no.

23:01.247 --> 23:02.580
Wait...

23:04.817 --> 23:06.283
Do you have any tampons?

23:07.687 --> 23:08.786
What?!

23:09.922 --> 23:13.657
I dunno, I guess I just forget
you're not eight anymore.

23:13.659 --> 23:15.326
Does that mean I can come?

23:16.095 --> 23:17.361
No.

23:19.766 --> 23:20.931
Jade!

23:30.443 --> 23:31.976
Shotgun!

23:32.945 --> 23:34.044
Did you know that saying

23:34.046 --> 23:35.980
actually came from
back in stagecoach days

23:35.982 --> 23:38.649
when an armed guard would
ride next to the driver?

23:48.928 --> 23:50.261
Go home.

23:50.263 --> 23:52.129
Talk to Mom and Dad.

23:52.131 --> 23:54.571
When I get back we'll pick a
weekend for you to come down.

23:55.568 --> 23:56.801
Be good.

23:56.803 --> 23:58.169
Have fun.

23:59.605 --> 24:01.338
Don't count on it.

24:09.115 --> 24:11.075
Wait, I think
I forgot something.

24:13.753 --> 24:14.985
Hey!

24:15.788 --> 24:17.748
Do you really
wanna take the bus?

24:32.371 --> 24:34.238
How long is the ride?

24:35.174 --> 24:37.294
Oh, it's about two and-a-half,
three hours.

25:05.304 --> 25:06.704
Hey!

25:12.812 --> 25:14.812
I really want...

25:14.814 --> 25:16.514
the radio on.

25:20.753 --> 25:21.852
Seriously?

25:21.854 --> 25:23.187
Yeah, Kennedy.

25:23.189 --> 25:25.189
I am serious,
and you should be, too.

25:25.191 --> 25:27.472
All right, this final
is worth half your grade...

25:28.861 --> 25:30.427
and I'm your TA.

25:36.002 --> 25:38.469
So, what's the plan
when we get there?

25:38.471 --> 25:40.804
It would be great if we could
talk to some of the locals.

25:40.806 --> 25:42.540
I mean, get a sense
of what people have seen...

25:42.542 --> 25:44.241
or think they've seen.

25:44.243 --> 25:45.709
Yeah, that's a good idea, Noah.

25:45.711 --> 25:47.244
Then maybe we can
scout the terrain ourselves

25:47.246 --> 25:49.747
and come up with
some theories of our own.

25:52.718 --> 25:55.252
My theory is it's all bullshit.

25:55.254 --> 25:56.720
Everyone knows people
just go up there

25:56.722 --> 25:58.756
to get stoned off their asses.

25:59.659 --> 26:00.925
People probably end up just...

26:00.927 --> 26:03.494
passing out and dehydrating
out there.

26:03.496 --> 26:05.396
Have you ever been stoned?

26:05.398 --> 26:06.797
Are you filming this?!

26:07.400 --> 26:08.999
Does she show up on film?

26:09.735 --> 26:12.002
Have you... been stoned?

26:13.673 --> 26:16.874
What, because I look like this,
I automatically am a pothead?

26:16.876 --> 26:18.208
I didn't say that.

26:18.210 --> 26:21.745
Y-you just seem to me
to be more like an X girl.

26:21.747 --> 26:23.747
But I say that
without any judgement.

26:26.752 --> 26:29.887
You know what, Noah,
you're growing on me.

26:29.889 --> 26:31.221
Oh, okay.

26:35.795 --> 26:37.094
Are we almost there?

26:37.096 --> 26:39.496
This drive is, like, brutal.

26:39.498 --> 26:40.764
We're not far.

26:40.766 --> 26:42.833
Yeah, I really have to pee.
Can we stop?

26:42.835 --> 26:45.603
Me too.
Like, really, really bad.

26:45.605 --> 26:48.238
Seriously? You can't hold it?
I mean, we're almost there.

26:48.240 --> 26:51.208
Yeah, but my bladder's
about to explode.

26:51.210 --> 26:53.711
Don't you think you're being
just a little overdramatic?

26:55.047 --> 26:57.615
No, I think that this
is being overdramatic!

27:01.520 --> 27:03.287
Jesus Christ, Kennedy!

27:07.326 --> 27:08.926
What the hell was that?!

27:52.905 --> 27:54.004
What the...

27:54.006 --> 27:55.372
Hi.

27:55.808 --> 27:56.940
Really?

28:03.015 --> 28:05.055
Kelly, what the hell
are you thinking?!

28:06.786 --> 28:08.085
Kennedy!

28:09.655 --> 28:10.954
What?

28:12.191 --> 28:14.658
I made an executive decision,
okay?

28:14.660 --> 28:17.061
Jade was being a witch.
Pun intended.

28:19.065 --> 28:20.865
What?

28:20.866 --> 28:22.666
Am I supposed to be scared,
or something?

28:22.668 --> 28:24.268
Ow!
- Jade, stop!

28:24.270 --> 28:25.502
Let me go!

28:25.504 --> 28:27.471
- Jade, stop!
- Let me go!

28:27.473 --> 28:30.040
Oh, my God, you bitch!
- Jade, stop!

28:30.042 --> 28:31.575
I'm the bitch?!

28:31.577 --> 28:32.476
I don't think you're a bitch.

28:32.478 --> 28:34.144
Jade, please don't be mad.

28:34.146 --> 28:35.579
I just... I'm not gonna
get in the way,

28:35.581 --> 28:36.880
and she was just trying to help!

28:36.882 --> 28:39.122
She doesn't wanna ever help
anyone but herself.

28:47.259 --> 28:49.293
You guys okay here?

28:49.295 --> 28:50.761
We're good, thanks.

28:54.133 --> 28:55.499
You goin' campin'?

28:57.136 --> 28:58.268
That's right.

29:01.073 --> 29:02.139
Where abouts?

29:02.141 --> 29:05.609
Why? So you
can follow us and kill us?

29:05.611 --> 29:07.044
Joshua Tree.

29:10.583 --> 29:13.117
Tonight's not a good night
for campin'.

29:13.119 --> 29:14.284
Why?

29:15.755 --> 29:17.221
It just isn't.

29:18.891 --> 29:20.124
It just isn't.

29:29.101 --> 29:30.300
Well, that was weird.

30:55.354 --> 30:57.354
I bet that's an awesome shot
of you.

30:58.991 --> 31:00.057
What?

31:01.794 --> 31:03.393
You by the fire.

31:03.395 --> 31:04.955
Really?

31:06.866 --> 31:08.332
Totally.

31:08.334 --> 31:09.933
If only we had a cauldron.

31:10.970 --> 31:11.969
Bit me.

31:11.971 --> 31:14.104
- Kennedy.
- I'm just kidding, okay?

31:14.106 --> 31:16.573
Everybody needs to relax.

31:16.575 --> 31:17.741
Here.

31:18.177 --> 31:19.343
Who wants one?

31:22.081 --> 31:23.146
Kelly?

31:25.284 --> 31:26.350
One.

31:26.352 --> 31:28.151
- Really?
- Nice.

31:30.189 --> 31:31.355
Jade?

31:32.358 --> 31:34.091
What the hell?

31:59.285 --> 32:00.484
Hmm.

32:02.955 --> 32:04.554
It's so peaceful here.

32:05.624 --> 32:07.591
That's probably what
all those people said, too...

32:07.593 --> 32:09.553
right before they disappeared.

32:10.663 --> 32:12.396
If they disappeared.

32:12.398 --> 32:14.464
Hey, someone should tell
a ghost story.

32:14.466 --> 32:15.933
Yeah, I agree.

32:16.635 --> 32:18.568
Does anyone know any good ones?

32:18.570 --> 32:21.405
Mr. Cooper, you must have
some good ones.

32:21.407 --> 32:22.506
Yeah, Mr. Cooper.

32:22.508 --> 32:24.074
Tell us a story.

32:25.978 --> 32:27.844
Well, I do know one.

32:31.250 --> 32:32.649
20 years ago,

32:32.651 --> 32:35.419
a few girls on campus
went missing.

32:35.421 --> 32:37.087
All right, but the only thing
they knew

32:37.089 --> 32:38.288
was that the murder weapon
was a hatchet,

32:38.290 --> 32:39.957
but they never caught the guy.

32:39.959 --> 32:41.658
Oh, my God.

32:41.660 --> 32:43.961
Two years later,
over Thanksgiving Break,

32:43.963 --> 32:47.130
two girls decided to stay
on campus and go to a bar.

32:47.132 --> 32:50.100
One of them met a guy, so naturally
the other one left.

32:50.102 --> 32:51.601
Did you hear that?

32:55.140 --> 32:56.473
Um, should we stop?

32:56.475 --> 32:58.308
No, I wanna hear
the rest of the story.

32:58.310 --> 33:00.177
Did you hear something?

33:00.179 --> 33:01.511
Probably just a rodent.

33:01.513 --> 33:03.480
They all come out at night.

33:03.482 --> 33:04.548
Ew.

33:05.217 --> 33:07.084
Do you want me to keep going?

33:07.086 --> 33:09.319
Uh-huh.

33:09.321 --> 33:10.654
Okay.

33:10.656 --> 33:12.656
Well, on her way home,
she heard footsteps behind her

33:12.658 --> 33:13.857
and she began to panic,

33:13.859 --> 33:15.158
so as soon as she got home,

33:15.160 --> 33:16.760
she pushed a heavy dresser
in front of the door

33:16.762 --> 33:19.029
and was finally able
to fall asleep.

33:20.165 --> 33:23.333
Rule Number One,
never fall asleep.

33:23.335 --> 33:24.701
Well, when she woke up,

33:24.703 --> 33:26.670
she pushed the heavy dresser
out of the way,

33:26.672 --> 33:28.205
opened the door,
took one step out,

33:28.207 --> 33:30.640
and slid and completely fell.

33:30.642 --> 33:31.875
She realized,
as she looked down,

33:31.877 --> 33:33.610
she was completely
covered in blood,

33:33.612 --> 33:35.445
with her friend's mutilated body

33:35.447 --> 33:36.580
right next to her,

33:36.582 --> 33:38.248
and a bloody hatchet
stuck in the wall.

33:38.250 --> 33:41.485
I-if the roommate hadn't've put
the dresser in front of the door!

33:41.487 --> 33:43.520
Yeah, but she didn't know.

33:43.522 --> 33:45.722
All things are easier
in hindsight.

33:47.693 --> 33:49.126
You okay?

33:50.362 --> 33:51.362
Yeah.

33:51.897 --> 33:53.897
Did you ever call Mom and Dad...

33:53.899 --> 33:55.179
let them know where you were?

33:56.668 --> 33:58.135
Oh, shit.

33:59.104 --> 34:01.304
Yeah... shit.

34:08.179 --> 34:09.446
Kelly...

34:11.617 --> 34:14.384
How would you
describe Joshua Tree?

34:14.386 --> 34:15.952
Describe it?

34:15.954 --> 34:17.654
Yes. For our project.

34:18.424 --> 34:20.657
The mood, the terrain...

34:21.360 --> 34:23.126
How does Joshua Tree feel?

34:28.367 --> 34:30.300
I think it feels...

34:31.437 --> 34:32.835
alive.

34:47.820 --> 34:49.985
Ghost stories make me horny.

34:49.987 --> 34:51.455
What doesn't make you horny?

34:51.456 --> 34:52.956
Are you complaining?

34:53.725 --> 34:55.685
No, I'm definitely
not complaining.

35:00.766 --> 35:02.232
You're a beer virgin!

35:02.234 --> 35:05.268
Noah, how does
your first beer taste?

35:06.905 --> 35:08.772
How did your first beer taste?

35:08.774 --> 35:11.641
Yeah! How'd...
your first beer taste?

35:11.643 --> 35:13.210
It was good.

35:15.781 --> 35:17.714
Ow! That hurt!

35:18.617 --> 35:19.416
What?

35:19.418 --> 35:21.451
You just scratched my back!

35:21.453 --> 35:23.019
I didn't touch your back.

35:23.021 --> 35:25.555
- Then what was that?
- I have no idea.

35:28.927 --> 35:30.594
It felt like a hand.

35:32.231 --> 35:34.164
Wait, what?

35:34.166 --> 35:36.286
That doesn't make any sense.
Here, show me.

35:41.640 --> 35:42.772
What?

35:44.943 --> 35:46.376
All right, we need to go.

35:46.912 --> 35:48.778
Come on, go. Go!

35:48.780 --> 35:50.447
- No. Go away!
- Come on!

35:50.449 --> 35:52.482
You know it's fun!
- Go away!

35:52.484 --> 35:55.051
Kelly, come on!

35:56.788 --> 35:58.989
We're having so much fun
right now.

35:58.991 --> 36:01.124
Okay, what about you?

36:01.126 --> 36:02.692
- Look at him!
- No!

36:02.694 --> 36:04.161
- He's like invisible paint.
- What?

36:04.163 --> 36:05.962
Ah! Don't look! Don't look!

36:05.964 --> 36:07.264
Come on.

36:07.266 --> 36:08.965
Come on, you know it's funny!

36:10.435 --> 36:13.203
Guys, something just grabbed me!

36:13.205 --> 36:14.871
What could possibly
have grabbed you?

36:14.873 --> 36:16.239
I don't know.

36:18.810 --> 36:20.510
Oh! I get it!

36:20.512 --> 36:21.512
You get what?

36:22.181 --> 36:24.714
That was good!
You actually almost had me!

36:25.684 --> 36:28.318
Does it look like
I'm making this up?!

36:36.728 --> 36:40.163
- I'm scared.
- It's okay, it's okay.

36:50.842 --> 36:53.043
- Do you see anything?!
- Nothing.

37:06.692 --> 37:08.292
It's okay.

37:08.994 --> 37:10.594
Holy shit!

37:13.298 --> 37:15.298
Okay, okay...

37:17.836 --> 37:20.136
- What the hell is that?
- I don't know. Let's get the hell outta here!

37:20.138 --> 37:21.738
For once, I agree with you.

37:21.740 --> 37:23.039
Jade!

37:36.688 --> 37:38.088
Oh, God, what was that?

37:39.024 --> 37:42.158
Everyone, back to the truck!
Now! Let's go!

37:42.160 --> 37:43.893
Go! Run! Go!

37:46.798 --> 37:47.831
Go!

37:47.833 --> 37:49.332
Run!

38:09.788 --> 38:11.087
Why won't the car start?!

38:11.089 --> 38:12.489
I don't know!

38:16.828 --> 38:19.429
Shit.
I think the battery's dead.

38:20.999 --> 38:22.932
Seriously?

38:28.006 --> 38:29.773
I can't see anything.

38:29.775 --> 38:31.408
What do you think it is?

38:33.178 --> 38:35.078
Guys, shh, shh, shh.

38:42.788 --> 38:43.820
Whoa!

38:46.158 --> 38:47.290
Oh, my God!

38:49.928 --> 38:52.662
Oh, my God. No, no...

38:58.770 --> 39:02.238
Jade, no, no, no...

39:18.890 --> 39:20.490
Start the car!

39:21.159 --> 39:22.659
Start the fucking car!

39:22.661 --> 39:23.993
I'm trying!

39:23.995 --> 39:25.695
Oh, my God!

39:25.697 --> 39:27.931
It's all my fault!
I shouldn't have come!

39:27.933 --> 39:29.399
This is not your fault, okay?
Look at me!

39:29.401 --> 39:31.901
We're gonna make it
through this, I promise.

39:32.804 --> 39:34.454
Guys, this car's dead,
all right?

39:34.455 --> 39:36.105
We need to get some help.
Can anybody get a signal?

39:36.108 --> 39:37.340
No.

39:37.342 --> 39:38.342
No.

39:38.944 --> 39:40.076
No.

39:40.078 --> 39:41.078
No!

39:41.813 --> 39:43.780
Wait, wait,
you guys notice that?

39:43.782 --> 39:45.014
What?

39:45.717 --> 39:47.016
It stopped.

39:50.655 --> 39:52.155
Maybe it left.

40:02.267 --> 40:04.334
Jade! Help me!

40:04.336 --> 40:06.136
I'm trying!

40:06.138 --> 40:07.937
Jade! Jade!

40:08.807 --> 40:11.007
Jade, don't let me go!

40:11.009 --> 40:12.542
I won't let go!

40:13.578 --> 40:16.713
No! Kelly, no! No!

40:24.523 --> 40:26.022
Jade, close the door.

40:28.727 --> 40:29.959
Jade!

40:51.716 --> 40:53.116
What do you want?!

40:53.118 --> 40:55.718
If you wanna get
outta here alive, follow me!

40:55.720 --> 40:56.853
What did he say?

40:56.855 --> 40:58.288
He wants us to go with him.

40:58.290 --> 41:00.156
Our car won't start!

41:00.625 --> 41:01.925
Shit!

41:01.927 --> 41:04.060
It's not safe here!

41:04.062 --> 41:05.728
Get in my truck!

41:05.730 --> 41:07.831
He wants us to go with him.

41:07.833 --> 41:09.699
How do we know we can trust him?

41:09.701 --> 41:10.900
We don't...

41:10.902 --> 41:12.502
but right now we don't
have another choice.

41:12.504 --> 41:14.938
No, no...

41:21.513 --> 41:23.546
Stay in the light!
In the light!

41:23.548 --> 41:24.848
No!

41:24.850 --> 41:26.783
What is wrong with all of you?!

41:26.785 --> 41:28.651
Jade, we need to find
a safe place to go,

41:28.653 --> 41:29.986
and then we can figure out
what to do.

41:29.988 --> 41:31.654
- Jade, please!
- Come on!

41:31.656 --> 41:33.857
No! I am not leaving her!

41:33.859 --> 41:35.124
No!

41:40.999 --> 41:42.799
We need to go now! Now!

41:42.801 --> 41:45.568
No! I am not leaving my sister!

41:45.570 --> 41:47.537
Kelly! Kelly!

41:47.539 --> 41:49.439
- Go! Go!
- No!

42:16.668 --> 42:18.101
Where are we?

42:19.671 --> 42:21.237
Somewhere safe.

42:21.239 --> 42:22.605
Why so many lights?

42:23.675 --> 42:25.408
Are you scared of the dark?

42:26.378 --> 42:28.611
Hell, yeah,
I'm scared of the dark.

42:28.613 --> 42:30.413
Tonight, you all should be too.

42:33.952 --> 42:35.451
You comin' or not?

42:57.609 --> 42:59.108
Who are you?

43:01.112 --> 43:02.779
Name's James.

43:03.248 --> 43:04.480
Last?

43:05.083 --> 43:06.249
What?

43:06.251 --> 43:08.384
Is James your first name
or your last?

43:13.291 --> 43:14.924
How'd you find us?

43:14.926 --> 43:16.960
I saw you
on the side of the road.

43:16.962 --> 43:19.395
I had a feeling
you wouldn't heed my advice...

43:22.334 --> 43:23.967
so I kept an ear out.

43:24.603 --> 43:26.202
Ear out? For what?

43:30.275 --> 43:31.574
Its sound.

43:34.746 --> 43:37.080
What? You know what this is?

43:44.322 --> 43:45.922
Comin'?

44:16.254 --> 44:18.254
You sure you wanna know
what it is?

44:21.559 --> 44:22.925
Yes.

44:22.927 --> 44:25.995
Her, um, her sister
was attacked.

44:31.336 --> 44:33.102
Well, she's dead.

44:33.905 --> 44:35.204
You don't know that.

44:37.342 --> 44:38.908
I do know that.

44:42.313 --> 44:43.946
What else do you know?

45:03.501 --> 45:04.701
Once every year,

45:04.703 --> 45:07.236
when the day and night
are in perfect alignment...

45:13.511 --> 45:15.011
it awakens to feed...

45:16.381 --> 45:17.814
to harvest.

45:17.816 --> 45:19.015
Harvest what?

45:21.119 --> 45:23.079
Thought that'd be obvious
by now.

45:24.422 --> 45:25.621
So, what is this thing?

45:25.623 --> 45:26.856
Where does it come from?

45:28.059 --> 45:29.759
No one knows for certain.

45:31.930 --> 45:34.263
It's got as many names
as it has victims.

45:37.936 --> 45:39.802
One thing we do know...

45:39.804 --> 45:41.070
It is old.

45:42.607 --> 45:44.874
Some believe it was here
before we were.

45:49.948 --> 45:51.514
What does it harvest for?

45:52.417 --> 45:53.417
Good question.

45:54.152 --> 45:56.753
Never gotten close enough
to damn ask it.

45:56.755 --> 45:58.454
So, all these people
that go missing every year,

45:58.456 --> 46:00.623
they were just taken...

46:00.625 --> 46:02.158
by this thing?

46:10.068 --> 46:11.634
The urban legend...

46:12.871 --> 46:14.170
it's true.

46:16.474 --> 46:19.242
Who gives a shit
about the urban legend?!

46:19.244 --> 46:21.043
I need to find my sister!

46:22.180 --> 46:24.447
Except this thing
ain't no urban legend.

46:25.416 --> 46:28.184
This thing is the origin.

46:29.454 --> 46:31.374
It's what inspires
urban legends.

46:32.123 --> 46:33.489
What about the police?

46:33.491 --> 46:35.591
What about 'em?

46:36.828 --> 46:38.427
Well, have you called them?

46:44.469 --> 46:46.169
So, that's your plan?

46:51.609 --> 46:52.809
Yeah.

46:55.446 --> 46:58.714
I been dealing with this... thing
since before you were born.

46:58.716 --> 47:00.016
All of yas.

47:03.454 --> 47:06.022
Anything you think of,
I've already done it.

47:06.958 --> 47:08.624
And what do you suggest we do?

47:09.694 --> 47:11.260
You wait out the night.

47:12.230 --> 47:13.896
That's all you can do.

47:15.967 --> 47:18.201
Well, that's not good enough.

47:18.203 --> 47:19.602
There must be something.

47:21.406 --> 47:22.438
Yeah.

47:23.308 --> 47:25.408
I can tell by the look
in your eyes...

47:25.410 --> 47:27.109
you're all thinkin'...

47:28.513 --> 47:31.147
and that is a bad idea.

47:31.149 --> 47:32.682
Well, we can't just
sit here and wait.

47:32.684 --> 47:34.217
We have to do something.

47:34.719 --> 47:36.052
Yeah, well...

47:36.054 --> 47:37.553
you're young.

47:38.823 --> 47:41.057
Hormones still ragin', I bet.

47:45.330 --> 47:48.164
You know, you remind me of me
when I was your age.

47:49.801 --> 47:51.200
Yeah.

47:51.202 --> 47:53.436
Bet you almost feel invincible.
Don't ya?

47:56.040 --> 47:58.040
Let me impart some wisdom to you

47:58.042 --> 48:00.109
that I wish someone
would've told me.

48:01.512 --> 48:04.580
Boy, you don't fight
what you can't kill.

48:04.582 --> 48:06.015
That's it.

48:07.252 --> 48:09.385
How do you know
it can't be killed?

48:09.387 --> 48:10.387
Yeah...

48:14.859 --> 48:17.593
I know a thing or two...
about killin'.

48:36.781 --> 48:39.115
I'm a hunter... by trade.

48:42.587 --> 48:45.788
I know how to track...
I know you to trap...

48:45.790 --> 48:48.190
and I know how to stop
a beatin' heart.

48:50.862 --> 48:52.295
If this thing could be killed,

48:52.297 --> 48:53.963
I woulda done it by now.

48:55.266 --> 48:56.732
Who's that guy with you?

49:00.271 --> 49:01.671
My brother.

49:03.074 --> 49:04.607
You seem really close.

49:06.244 --> 49:07.576
We were.

49:09.147 --> 49:10.313
Were?

49:13.685 --> 49:14.984
He's dead.

49:30.201 --> 49:32.668
It was 36 years ago tonight.

49:35.340 --> 49:37.206
Just comin' back from a hunt.

49:39.077 --> 49:40.776
We had bagged a grizzly...

49:42.113 --> 49:45.614
and were passing through
this God-forsaken town.

49:54.025 --> 49:56.592
I decided that we should stop...

49:56.594 --> 49:58.227
and grab a beer.

50:01.866 --> 50:03.466
Goddamn beer.

50:07.638 --> 50:09.505
That's when this gal,
she come runnin' into the bar,

50:09.507 --> 50:12.241
screaming and hollerin'
about her friend had been...

50:12.243 --> 50:14.777
attacked by this...
wild animal.

50:14.779 --> 50:15.711
Yeah.

50:15.713 --> 50:18.681
Naturally,
my brother and I, we...

50:18.683 --> 50:20.883
We offered to help her
kill the damn thing...

50:23.021 --> 50:24.954
because we two wet young...

50:26.758 --> 50:28.624
invincible.

50:31.896 --> 50:34.096
I'm so sorry about your brother.

50:35.400 --> 50:38.434
I'm sure you tried everything
you could do to save him.

50:39.570 --> 50:41.303
I wish that were true.

50:48.613 --> 50:50.012
I got scared...

50:53.051 --> 50:54.250
and I ran.

50:57.622 --> 50:58.921
I ran.

51:01.359 --> 51:02.858
Is that why you stayed?

51:04.362 --> 51:06.662
Waiting for your chance
to kill it?

51:06.664 --> 51:08.130
I told you, boy...

51:08.966 --> 51:10.766
This thing can't be killed.

51:12.603 --> 51:16.939
But I swore to myself that day,
I would never run again.

51:16.941 --> 51:18.174
Ever.

51:19.210 --> 51:21.010
James, we need to get help.

51:22.947 --> 51:24.613
We have to try...

51:27.952 --> 51:29.318
for Kelly.

51:32.223 --> 51:34.490
Do you have a phone that works?

51:34.492 --> 51:35.825
It's in there.

51:36.961 --> 51:39.328
Don't know what good
it's gonna do you, but...

51:39.330 --> 51:41.030
knock yourself out.

51:47.205 --> 51:49.338
What am I supposed to tell
my parents?

51:58.816 --> 52:01.217
Why are you looking at me
like that?

52:01.219 --> 52:03.552
This is all your fault...

52:04.288 --> 52:06.956
you stupid, selfish bitch.

52:06.958 --> 52:10.326
Jade, I never meant for Kelly
to get hurt!

52:10.328 --> 52:12.194
She's not hurt, Kennedy...

52:12.997 --> 52:14.630
She's dead!

52:14.632 --> 52:15.698
Don't you get that?!

52:15.700 --> 52:18.334
I know!
I'm really sorry!

52:18.336 --> 52:19.835
Oh, you're sorry?

52:21.906 --> 52:24.874
Don't you realize
your actions have consequences?

52:24.876 --> 52:26.375
Hey!

52:28.346 --> 52:30.146
Jade, look,
I'm not gonna pretend

52:30.148 --> 52:31.981
to know what you're going
through right now, all right?

52:31.983 --> 52:33.449
But we can't turn on each other.

52:36.354 --> 52:38.387
Thank you, Mr. Cooper...

52:38.956 --> 52:40.923
for that sage advice.

52:42.059 --> 52:44.894
It really means a lot
coming from you.

52:46.864 --> 52:48.130
Jade.

52:48.132 --> 52:49.265
No...

52:50.134 --> 52:53.102
You have no idea
what I'm going through.

52:57.508 --> 52:58.707
Let her go.

53:00.144 --> 53:01.410
No.

53:02.046 --> 53:03.479
I don't think I will.

53:05.049 --> 53:06.382
Make the call.

53:14.559 --> 53:16.192
You all right?

53:16.194 --> 53:17.426
No.

53:19.130 --> 53:20.763
What are we gonna do, Ethan?

53:22.333 --> 53:23.499
What are we gonna do?

53:25.770 --> 53:27.169
We're gonna get help.

54:53.457 --> 54:55.497
We should probably
all stick together.

55:00.464 --> 55:02.024
Jade.
- Don't.

55:10.474 --> 55:12.341
<i>911. What is your emergency?</i>

55:12.343 --> 55:14.476
Yes, I'd like to report a...

55:14.478 --> 55:15.678
Um...

55:20.351 --> 55:22.718
We were camping and one of
our friends, was, um...

55:23.854 --> 55:25.454
She-she was...

55:27.658 --> 55:31.093
She was ta... Look, we're
stranded and we need help.

55:36.567 --> 55:37.966
What'd they say?

55:37.968 --> 55:39.301
They're sending an officer.

55:39.303 --> 55:40.703
Someone should be here
within the hour.

55:40.705 --> 55:43.372
On hour?! What are we
supposed to do until then?

55:45.576 --> 55:46.842
We wait.

55:46.844 --> 55:48.744
What if the thing comes here?

55:50.781 --> 55:52.047
It won't.

55:53.851 --> 55:55.651
You know that for a fact?

55:56.854 --> 55:59.054
As long as these light stay on,
we're safe.

56:05.629 --> 56:07.429
It won't come into the light.

56:16.240 --> 56:18.080
Have you ever seen it?

56:22.079 --> 56:23.412
Once.

56:32.923 --> 56:34.390
What did it look like?

56:36.527 --> 56:38.327
What did my sister see?

56:46.971 --> 56:48.270
Tell me.

56:50.574 --> 56:52.341
Your sister saw evil...

56:54.044 --> 56:55.310
incarnate.

56:57.748 --> 56:59.782
A soulless creature...

56:59.784 --> 57:01.884
that rips its victims apart.

57:04.188 --> 57:07.055
No... no...

57:08.259 --> 57:09.458
No!

57:10.594 --> 57:12.060
It's got these...

57:13.297 --> 57:15.364
these long fingers...

57:17.067 --> 57:20.068
with razor sharp teeth
and claws to match.

57:24.775 --> 57:26.208
It is...

57:28.179 --> 57:29.912
It is an abomination.

57:34.485 --> 57:35.417
No!

57:35.419 --> 57:37.786
<i>It's got these...</i>

57:37.788 --> 57:39.721
these eyes that...

57:47.498 --> 57:48.931
These eyes...

58:03.747 --> 58:04.747
Like this?

58:53.864 --> 58:55.464
What if they don't come?

58:58.402 --> 58:59.668
They'll be here.

59:03.207 --> 59:04.973
I hope it was quick.

59:05.776 --> 59:06.975
What?

59:07.912 --> 59:09.011
Kelly.

59:12.550 --> 59:14.116
I hope it was quick.

59:15.853 --> 59:19.021
The last thing she felt
was my hand letting go.

59:22.126 --> 59:23.859
You didn't let go.

59:25.195 --> 59:26.762
You couldn't hold on.

59:27.965 --> 59:29.197
Does it matter?

59:40.144 --> 59:41.777
When I was nine...

59:42.646 --> 59:44.446
my father...

59:45.683 --> 59:47.416
drunk off his ass...

59:48.719 --> 59:51.186
came to pick me up
from a friend's house.

59:52.423 --> 59:53.622
My mother...

59:54.558 --> 59:58.927
sober, sat in
the passenger seat as he...

59:58.929 --> 01:00:01.229
drove up on the front lawn.

01:00:05.569 --> 01:00:07.669
I was so embarrassed...

01:00:08.806 --> 01:00:10.505
getting into the car.

01:00:11.475 --> 01:00:13.675
I asked my mother to drive...

01:00:14.845 --> 01:00:18.080
and she told me to be quiet.

01:00:20.884 --> 01:00:24.486
On the way home,
we were in a terrible accident.

01:00:26.357 --> 01:00:28.023
My dad...

01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:30.859
he died.

01:00:32.963 --> 01:00:34.596
My mother was hurt.

01:00:37.267 --> 01:00:40.235
I was banged up, but... okay.

01:00:43.941 --> 01:00:45.607
I forgave my dad...

01:00:47.177 --> 01:00:49.845
Wasn't worth the energy
it took to hate him.

01:00:54.284 --> 01:00:56.244
Couldn't forgive
my mom, though...

01:00:57.621 --> 01:00:59.721
'cause she didn't even try.

01:01:03.394 --> 01:01:05.594
I guess what I'm saying is...

01:01:06.630 --> 01:01:08.030
it does matter.

01:01:11.935 --> 01:01:14.603
I think in that final moment,
Kelly knew that.

01:01:22.646 --> 01:01:23.945
Can I ask you something?

01:01:28.318 --> 01:01:29.438
Would you have done it?

01:01:29.987 --> 01:01:31.253
The razor...

01:01:31.689 --> 01:01:32.954
What do you care?

01:01:33.791 --> 01:01:35.991
I-I thought we were...

01:01:35.993 --> 01:01:37.426
were friends.

01:01:41.632 --> 01:01:42.798
I care.

01:01:50.074 --> 01:01:51.173
No.

01:02:04.955 --> 01:02:06.855
Ethan, I'm scared.

01:02:06.857 --> 01:02:08.657
Everything's gonna be okay.

01:02:08.659 --> 01:02:09.925
All right, as soon
as the police get here

01:02:09.927 --> 01:02:11.193
we're gonna
tell them everything.

01:02:11.195 --> 01:02:12.928
But we don't even know
what happened, okay?

01:02:12.930 --> 01:02:15.030
One minute we were just, like,
telling ghost stories,

01:02:15.032 --> 01:02:16.932
and the next, Kelly's being
dragged out of the car

01:02:16.934 --> 01:02:18.500
by what?

01:02:20.838 --> 01:02:22.204
I don't know.

01:02:27.711 --> 01:02:29.144
I wanna thank you.

01:02:32.916 --> 01:02:34.116
For what?

01:02:35.552 --> 01:02:37.152
For putting up with me.

01:02:38.956 --> 01:02:41.957
I know I can be...
difficult sometimes.

01:02:43.293 --> 01:02:44.626
Sometimes?

01:02:47.564 --> 01:02:49.698
Sorry, not-not the right time.

01:02:50.701 --> 01:02:53.435
I'm not really a bitch,
you know.

01:02:53.437 --> 01:02:54.903
I don't think you're a bitch.

01:02:58.242 --> 01:02:59.875
Jade does.

01:03:03.881 --> 01:03:05.347
I guess...

01:03:07.084 --> 01:03:09.751
sometimes it's just easier
to be the person that...

01:03:09.753 --> 01:03:13.488
people expect me to be
rather than...

01:03:13.490 --> 01:03:15.357
let them see the real me.

01:03:16.393 --> 01:03:18.360
It's just easier that way.

01:03:19.696 --> 01:03:20.862
I see you.

01:03:21.498 --> 01:03:23.265
You're smart,

01:03:23.267 --> 01:03:24.566
you're funny...

01:03:25.135 --> 01:03:26.501
you're kind.

01:03:33.677 --> 01:03:36.917
I thought you weren't supposed to
give students special treatment.

01:03:40.751 --> 01:03:43.051
Well, you do have
a really nice ass.

01:03:48.792 --> 01:03:50.672
I see lights!

01:03:57.601 --> 01:03:59.034
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:03:59.870 --> 01:04:01.403
Let 'em pull all the way up.

01:04:06.910 --> 01:04:08.243
What's he doing?

01:04:08.946 --> 01:04:09.946
He's stopping.

01:04:10.948 --> 01:04:13.229
Maybe we can signal him.
Do you have a flashlight?

01:04:15.652 --> 01:04:16.952
Here.

01:04:23.694 --> 01:04:25.694
Naw, that ain't the police.

01:04:25.696 --> 01:04:26.828
What?

01:04:26.830 --> 01:04:28.663
Who is it?

01:04:28.665 --> 01:04:30.565
Goddamn tourists.

01:04:30.567 --> 01:04:33.235
Probably passion' through
and saw the lights.

01:04:33.237 --> 01:04:35.397
What if they're in trouble?
We have to help!

01:04:36.506 --> 01:04:39.808
That's damn near 500 feet away.

01:04:39.810 --> 01:04:42.477
Guess you ain't noticed
them lights don't go that far.

01:04:42.479 --> 01:04:43.879
He makes a good point.

01:04:45.949 --> 01:04:47.682
All right, well...

01:04:47.684 --> 01:04:51.019
this should give us enough
light to make it there and back.

01:04:51.021 --> 01:04:52.287
Whoa...

01:04:53.390 --> 01:04:55.490
Hell, I know you're just
trying to do the right thing.

01:04:55.492 --> 01:04:58.093
You go out there now
it's just plain suicide.

01:05:02.966 --> 01:05:04.432
We have to try.

01:05:08.305 --> 01:05:10.345
I'd want someone
to do the same for me.

01:05:16.246 --> 01:05:17.712
Anyone?

01:05:18.949 --> 01:05:20.115
Eh.

01:05:21.285 --> 01:05:22.285
Fine.

01:05:22.653 --> 01:05:23.818
Wait.

01:05:25.055 --> 01:05:26.321
I'll go.

01:05:26.990 --> 01:05:28.290
Ethan.

01:05:29.326 --> 01:05:30.792
We'll be fine.

01:05:55.552 --> 01:05:58.320
Jade, I really am sorry
about Kelly.

01:06:00.958 --> 01:06:03.058
I'm sorry about a lot of things.

01:06:16.006 --> 01:06:17.339
You ready?

01:06:19.009 --> 01:06:20.041
No.

01:06:20.043 --> 01:06:21.509
Not really.

01:06:22.279 --> 01:06:23.745
Yeah. Me neither.

01:07:17.534 --> 01:07:19.401
- Oh, my God.
- Oh no.

01:07:21.138 --> 01:07:22.237
Let's go back.

01:07:22.239 --> 01:07:23.919
Come on.

01:07:25.308 --> 01:07:26.941
What are we doing?

01:07:26.943 --> 01:07:28.043
Come on.

01:07:28.612 --> 01:07:30.111
Come on.
- What the hell?

01:07:30.113 --> 01:07:32.547
This is not good.
Let's go back.

01:07:32.549 --> 01:07:33.715
Shit.

01:07:33.717 --> 01:07:34.949
Mr. Cooper.

01:07:36.086 --> 01:07:37.086
Shit.

01:07:37.421 --> 01:07:38.853
Mr. Cooper, come on.

01:07:39.723 --> 01:07:40.989
What are you doing?

01:07:44.694 --> 01:07:46.361
Get in the headlights!

01:08:04.548 --> 01:08:06.014
Where's the flashlight?

01:08:07.951 --> 01:08:10.885
I don't know. I'm sorry, Mr.
Cooper, I lost it.

01:08:12.656 --> 01:08:13.888
Okay.

01:08:14.791 --> 01:08:17.091
How are we gonna make it
back to the house?

01:08:17.094 --> 01:08:18.393
I'm working on it.

01:08:19.362 --> 01:08:20.627
Do you have your cell phone?

01:08:23.834 --> 01:08:25.834
All right.
Turn on your flashlight.

01:08:27.770 --> 01:08:29.370
I'm almost out of battery.

01:08:29.372 --> 01:08:31.406
Shit. All right.

01:08:31.408 --> 01:08:34.075
Do you think it'll last
'til we get all the way there?

01:08:34.077 --> 01:08:35.176
I think so.

01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:38.129
Okay.

01:08:38.130 --> 01:08:40.290
I don't think this
is gonna be enough light.

01:08:40.649 --> 01:08:41.783
Okay.

01:08:41.785 --> 01:08:43.151
All right.

01:08:43.153 --> 01:08:44.886
Let's go back to back.

01:08:44.888 --> 01:08:45.987
Come on.

01:08:45.988 --> 01:08:47.354
Put your back against mine.

01:08:49.493 --> 01:08:50.825
All right, you ready?

01:08:50.827 --> 01:08:52.160
Yeah, let's do it.

01:09:14.417 --> 01:09:15.649
How you doin'?

01:09:15.652 --> 01:09:16.885
Mr. Cooper...

01:09:16.886 --> 01:09:18.185
Yeah?

01:09:19.856 --> 01:09:21.788
I think my phone's about to die.

01:09:21.791 --> 01:09:22.957
What?

01:09:25.562 --> 01:09:27.462
Christ, that's not enough light!

01:09:27.464 --> 01:09:28.630
It's dead.

01:09:34.203 --> 01:09:35.703
It's not enough light!

01:09:41.511 --> 01:09:42.844
Noah, we're gonna have to run.

01:09:44.648 --> 01:09:46.014
Noah, run!

01:09:51.821 --> 01:09:53.054
Come on!

01:09:56.693 --> 01:09:57.759
Noah!

01:09:57.761 --> 01:09:59.761
Argh!

01:09:59.763 --> 01:10:00.929
Help! Oh, help me!

01:10:00.931 --> 01:10:03.364
- Hold on!
- You hold on!

01:10:05.235 --> 01:10:06.301
Move!

01:10:06.870 --> 01:10:07.835
I'm slipping!

01:10:07.837 --> 01:10:08.870
Oh, no!

01:10:11.308 --> 01:10:12.908
Hold on!

01:10:32.696 --> 01:10:33.861
Move your ass!

01:10:36.466 --> 01:10:37.565
Come on.

01:10:45.275 --> 01:10:47.141
Come on! Let's go! Move!

01:10:50.413 --> 01:10:52.914
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, geez.

01:10:52.916 --> 01:10:54.282
Thank you.

01:11:01.358 --> 01:11:02.957
I thought I was gonna lose you!

01:11:02.959 --> 01:11:04.492
I'm okay.

01:11:18.008 --> 01:11:19.374
It's gettin' bolder.

01:11:23.313 --> 01:11:24.412
James.

01:11:25.849 --> 01:11:27.148
Yeah?

01:11:27.884 --> 01:11:29.217
I want to thank you.

01:11:32.956 --> 01:11:34.355
Don't thank me yet.

01:11:37.761 --> 01:11:39.227
This thing ain't through.

01:11:45.335 --> 01:11:46.734
Are you all right?

01:11:48.338 --> 01:11:50.298
That almost sounded
like you care.

01:11:52.075 --> 01:11:54.242
Well, we're friends, aren't we?

01:12:04.888 --> 01:12:06.621
That looks pretty bad.

01:12:08.858 --> 01:12:10.925
I think I saw some bandages
in there medicine cabinet.

01:12:10.927 --> 01:12:12.393
I'll-I'll be right back.

01:12:16.499 --> 01:12:17.899
Jade.

01:12:21.638 --> 01:12:22.970
Thanks.

01:12:51.634 --> 01:12:53.101
So, that was pretty, uh...

01:12:53.103 --> 01:12:54.569
Fucked up?

01:12:56.206 --> 01:12:58.005
Sorry.
- No.

01:12:58.875 --> 01:13:00.942
Couldn't've said it
better myself.

01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:05.012
You okay?

01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:18.259
Better charge this...

01:13:18.261 --> 01:13:20.221
in case we need the light again.

01:14:05.008 --> 01:14:07.208
Don't expect
you'll be sleepin' much...

01:14:08.445 --> 01:14:09.577
Here.

01:14:12.816 --> 01:14:15.783
It gets colder than you
might think here at night.

01:14:15.785 --> 01:14:16.918
Thank you.

01:14:19.456 --> 01:14:20.655
Yeah.

01:14:28.798 --> 01:14:30.678
You all right?
You're shaking.

01:14:31.334 --> 01:14:32.900
I just wanna go home.

01:14:35.505 --> 01:14:36.571
Me too.

01:14:37.607 --> 01:14:40.107
This was just supposed to be
a stupid story.

01:14:41.211 --> 01:14:42.844
What if the thing comes back?

01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:45.446
What happened to Kelly...

01:14:48.218 --> 01:14:49.717
I don't wanna die.

01:14:52.622 --> 01:14:54.522
No, hey.

01:14:54.524 --> 01:14:57.091
No... we're safe now.

01:14:58.127 --> 01:14:59.127
I mean...

01:14:59.629 --> 01:15:01.162
Everything's gonna be okay.

01:15:15.578 --> 01:15:16.944
Oh, that's not good.

01:15:19.549 --> 01:15:20.715
Ah!

01:15:28.024 --> 01:15:29.624
Jesus! What the hell happened?!

01:15:29.626 --> 01:15:32.093
I think I blew a fuse
when I plugged in my phone.

01:15:32.095 --> 01:15:34.328
God damn you, kid!

01:15:34.330 --> 01:15:36.063
- I'm sorry, I didn't...
- You're sorry?!

01:15:36.065 --> 01:15:38.165
You're goddamn sorry?!

01:15:38.167 --> 01:15:39.667
Them lights were the only thing
keeping that thing

01:15:39.669 --> 01:15:41.502
from comin'
through the damned door!

01:15:41.504 --> 01:15:43.504
Once that happens,
sorry won't mean shit!

01:15:43.506 --> 01:15:44.639
Hey!

01:15:49.012 --> 01:15:50.778
You just killed us all.

01:15:51.948 --> 01:15:53.908
I need to get
some light in here.

01:16:04.394 --> 01:16:07.795
- I didn't think. I'm sorry.
- Noah... relax.

01:16:11.868 --> 01:16:13.267
Get over here.

01:16:19.709 --> 01:16:22.009
Is this really
gonna be enough light?

01:16:22.011 --> 01:16:23.377
I don't know.

01:16:24.247 --> 01:16:26.247
Then please tell me
you have a plan.

01:16:30.987 --> 01:16:33.287
If I can get to the box,
I can fix it.

01:16:35.191 --> 01:16:36.657
Where's the box?

01:16:48.571 --> 01:16:49.904
Where's Jade?

01:17:13.262 --> 01:17:15.222
She must still be
in the bathroom.

01:17:17.467 --> 01:17:18.733
I'll go.

01:17:21.237 --> 01:17:22.770
What?

01:17:22.772 --> 01:17:25.039
Nothing, just... be careful.

01:17:40.623 --> 01:17:42.323
Jade, it's just me. Okay?

01:17:42.325 --> 01:17:43.724
We blew a fuse.
James is gonna fix it.

01:17:43.726 --> 01:17:45.126
Okay? Come on.

01:17:49.832 --> 01:17:51.332
You listen up.

01:17:53.136 --> 01:17:54.769
Ah, Jesus.

01:17:54.771 --> 01:17:56.270
Look, I need to get
to the side of the house

01:17:56.272 --> 01:17:57.805
to the circuit box.

01:17:57.807 --> 01:18:00.374
This should buy me ten minutes.

01:18:00.376 --> 01:18:02.143
You all wait by that window.

01:18:02.145 --> 01:18:03.611
You see me coming back,
you open the door.

01:18:03.613 --> 01:18:05.346
I'm gonna throw this flare.

01:18:05.348 --> 01:18:07.388
It should buy me time
to get back in.

01:18:09.852 --> 01:18:11.218
Yeah...

01:18:21.698 --> 01:18:23.330
You remember what I said.

01:19:14.550 --> 01:19:15.883
Jesus.

01:20:03.733 --> 01:20:05.065
Jesus!

01:20:19.348 --> 01:20:20.881
God damnit.

01:20:25.254 --> 01:20:26.420
God damnit.

01:20:33.062 --> 01:20:34.528
God damnit.

01:20:37.166 --> 01:20:38.532
God damnit.

01:21:05.695 --> 01:21:07.161
I will never give up.

01:21:08.064 --> 01:21:09.463
I will not give in.

01:21:36.692 --> 01:21:37.791
No!

01:22:26.075 --> 01:22:27.508
Come on, you bitch!

01:22:29.378 --> 01:22:30.378
Come on!

01:22:31.881 --> 01:22:33.147
Oh, Jesus!

01:22:35.451 --> 01:22:36.451
Ah!

01:23:01.711 --> 01:23:03.610
Oh, my God.

01:23:20.863 --> 01:23:22.296
Oh, God!

01:23:44.353 --> 01:23:45.886
What the hell are we gonna do?

01:23:49.625 --> 01:23:51.225
Why is everybody lookin' at me?

01:23:52.495 --> 01:23:54.762
Look, right now,
any idea is a good idea.

01:23:54.764 --> 01:23:56.663
What if we try and sneak out?

01:23:56.665 --> 01:23:57.731
Except that one.

01:23:58.200 --> 01:23:59.867
All right, look.
How much light do we have?

01:23:59.869 --> 01:24:02.069
I think I have
a little bit of battery left.

01:24:02.071 --> 01:24:03.904
We have the candles, right?

01:24:03.906 --> 01:24:06.106
Maybe we could light a fire.
That's plenty of light.

01:24:06.108 --> 01:24:08.108
One problem,
we don't have any wood.

01:24:09.678 --> 01:24:12.279
What if we-what if we just wait
until the sun comes up?

01:24:12.281 --> 01:24:13.714
It can't be that late, right?

01:24:13.716 --> 01:24:14.915
What time is it?

01:24:14.917 --> 01:24:16.050
Four in the morning.

01:24:16.052 --> 01:24:18.719
Okay, that's only two hours
'til the sun comes up.

01:24:42.278 --> 01:24:43.358
What are we gonna do?

01:24:44.213 --> 01:24:46.613
All right, we know this thing
doesn't like light, right?

01:24:46.615 --> 01:24:48.482
All right, there's gotta be
something in this house we can use.

01:24:48.484 --> 01:24:49.616
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:24:49.618 --> 01:24:51.452
- I'll look in there.
- Okay.

01:24:51.454 --> 01:24:53.014
- Okay.
- Go!

01:25:20.116 --> 01:25:22.236
I think I found something
that might work!

01:25:25.554 --> 01:25:27.287
I don't think it wants
its picture taken.

01:25:27.289 --> 01:25:29.289
No, I think the flash
might be bright enough.

01:25:29.291 --> 01:25:30.357
And if it's not?

01:25:31.327 --> 01:25:34.261
Guys, my phone died,
but I found a flashlight.

01:25:42.104 --> 01:25:43.837
What the hell was that?

01:25:44.673 --> 01:25:46.713
Sounded like
there was a door opening.

01:25:48.777 --> 01:25:50.043
I locked the door.

01:25:51.213 --> 01:25:52.613
Yeah, me too.

01:25:53.749 --> 01:25:55.949
How many doors
does this place have?

01:25:55.951 --> 01:25:58.232
All right, if that was a door,
we need to lock it.

01:25:59.622 --> 01:26:00.821
That thing works, right?

01:26:00.823 --> 01:26:02.523
I haven't tried it yet.

01:26:02.525 --> 01:26:04.625
It looks like
there's film in here.

01:26:07.096 --> 01:26:08.195
All right.

01:26:08.564 --> 01:26:09.897
Okay.

01:27:16.298 --> 01:27:18.198
Shit! Shit!

01:27:26.909 --> 01:27:28.429
Noah!

01:27:33.415 --> 01:27:34.895
No!

01:27:36.185 --> 01:27:37.284
No!

01:27:38.654 --> 01:27:39.953
Oh, my God.

01:27:39.955 --> 01:27:41.021
Oh, my God.

01:27:42.725 --> 01:27:44.124
What can I do?

01:27:49.398 --> 01:27:51.038
I'm sorry.

01:27:51.500 --> 01:27:52.799
No.

01:27:53.369 --> 01:27:54.501
No.

01:27:55.571 --> 01:27:56.737
No.

01:28:11.754 --> 01:28:13.754
No.

01:28:32.007 --> 01:28:33.440
Jade! Where are you going?!

01:28:33.442 --> 01:28:34.641
Jade!

01:28:56.532 --> 01:28:58.598
No!

01:29:04.073 --> 01:29:05.572
No! No!

01:29:05.574 --> 01:29:07.641
No!

01:29:17.786 --> 01:29:19.319
Go get the flashlight!

01:29:26.161 --> 01:29:27.394
It's okay!

01:29:27.396 --> 01:29:29.096
I got you. I got you, Jade.

01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:33.233
I can't! I can't!

01:29:33.235 --> 01:29:35.235
I got you. Come on.

01:29:35.237 --> 01:29:36.903
- Jade, come on!
- Jade!

01:29:36.905 --> 01:29:38.672
Just go!

01:29:40.542 --> 01:29:42.309
I don't think
she can move her leg.

01:29:42.311 --> 01:29:44.077
No, we got this.

01:29:44.747 --> 01:29:45.747
Just go.

01:29:46.248 --> 01:29:47.948
- Jade!
- Just go!

01:29:47.950 --> 01:29:50.117
We're not gonna leave
without you!

01:29:56.425 --> 01:29:58.158
Just go!

01:29:58.894 --> 01:30:01.128
Just go. Just go.

01:30:01.130 --> 01:30:02.796
Jade, no.

01:30:09.104 --> 01:30:11.938
No... Jade!

01:30:33.228 --> 01:30:34.728
Oh, Jade.

01:30:45.374 --> 01:30:47.741
Okay... okay...

01:30:52.314 --> 01:30:53.346
Come on!

01:30:54.149 --> 01:30:55.149
Over here.

01:30:56.251 --> 01:30:59.352
Outside?! There's nowhere
to hide out there!

01:30:59.354 --> 01:31:01.421
The sun's coming up, okay?
All right, listen to me.

01:31:01.423 --> 01:31:02.889
All we have to do
is go out this window.

01:31:02.891 --> 01:31:04.758
By the time that thing figures
out that we're not here,

01:31:04.760 --> 01:31:05.692
it'll all be over.
- Okay.

01:31:05.694 --> 01:31:07.574
- All right? Come on.
- Okay.

01:31:09.631 --> 01:31:11.431
I can't leave you!

01:31:13.469 --> 01:31:14.935
All right,
I'm gonna go first, okay?

01:31:14.937 --> 01:31:15.936
- Okay.
- All right.

01:31:15.938 --> 01:31:17.858
I'll catch you
on the other side.

01:31:18.173 --> 01:31:19.439
Okay, be careful.

01:31:20.776 --> 01:31:22.242
Okay. Are you okay?

01:31:23.645 --> 01:31:26.413
Come on!
Come on, I'll get you!

01:31:27.549 --> 01:31:28.815
Kennedy!

01:31:47.603 --> 01:31:49.202
Kennedy?

01:31:50.706 --> 01:31:52.939
I remember you.

01:32:09.291 --> 01:32:10.824
Ethan.

01:32:10.826 --> 01:32:12.092
Kennedy!

01:32:13.529 --> 01:32:14.828
- Run.
- No.

01:32:14.830 --> 01:32:16.930
Ethan... run.

01:32:16.932 --> 01:32:18.031
- No.
- Run.

01:32:18.033 --> 01:32:19.873
- I'm not leaving you.
- Run.

01:32:21.436 --> 01:32:22.802
Let her go!

01:32:25.574 --> 01:32:26.574
Come on!

01:32:27.209 --> 01:32:29.175
Come finish what you started!

01:32:30.712 --> 01:32:32.212
Kennedy!
