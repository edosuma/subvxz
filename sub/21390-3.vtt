00:00.898 --> 00:02.875
<i>Previously on "Somewhere Between"...</i>

00:02.990 --> 00:05.017
The killer called your show.
He said he had Serena

00:05.042 --> 00:06.577
Then the next day
in Black Pine Cove, they...

00:06.602 --> 00:07.501
Oh, my God.

00:07.592 --> 00:09.659
For one to live, one must die.

00:09.705 --> 00:12.573
Mommy's coming, angel.

00:12.642 --> 00:15.109
I came back to eight days before.

00:15.177 --> 00:16.309
Is it really you?

00:16.379 --> 00:17.511
Sometimes it's like you're asleep

00:17.580 --> 00:18.979
and something wakes you up.

00:19.048 --> 00:21.382
Who did your brother was
responsible for Susanna's death?

00:21.450 --> 00:24.318
- I killed her!
- Are they gonna kill my dad?

00:24.387 --> 00:27.021
No. I will never let them hurt my baby.

00:27.089 --> 00:29.790
The man who's been killing
those women in the city,

00:29.859 --> 00:32.092
he's going to drown my little girl.

00:33.262 --> 00:35.629
I need your help to catch him.

00:35.698 --> 00:38.599
- We saved her.
- I'm getting the cops!

00:38.668 --> 00:40.734
Come on!

00:46.309 --> 00:49.047
Officer! Oh, my God. Please, please!

00:49.072 --> 00:50.288
I need your help! I need your help!

00:50.313 --> 00:51.979
He's gonna try and kill me!
You have to help me!

00:52.048 --> 00:53.347
What...

00:54.984 --> 00:57.481
Who are you?

_

01:42.364 --> 01:43.558
Where are you?

01:45.643 --> 01:47.410
Can we talk about it when I get home?

01:47.523 --> 01:49.123
Is Serena okay?

01:49.158 --> 01:50.615
What the hell, Laura?

01:50.669 --> 01:52.860
Just tell me. How's Serena?

01:52.887 --> 01:54.888
Well, you lied to me.
You said you were going to the station.

01:54.930 --> 01:57.231
Daddy... I can't sleep.

01:57.266 --> 02:00.134
Hey, what's, uh... what's
bothering you, honey?

02:00.169 --> 02:03.438
Nothing. My eyes just won't close.

02:03.472 --> 02:05.406
What's that?

02:05.441 --> 02:07.909
Oh, it's just an old thing I'm
giving away to a thrift store.

02:07.943 --> 02:10.511
I'll talk to you later.

02:17.753 --> 02:19.220
You know what?

02:19.254 --> 02:21.222
I...

02:21.256 --> 02:23.391
am gonna sing you a song.

02:23.562 --> 02:25.897
- No daddy singing!
- Oh, yes.

02:25.922 --> 02:29.530
It'll be so terrible you'll fall
asleep just to get away from it.

02:30.180 --> 02:31.666
Or run.

02:35.571 --> 02:38.673
So, someone else comes along,
just by coincidence,

02:38.707 --> 02:40.808
runs into Fiona and stabs her 20 times?

02:40.843 --> 02:42.643
Look, obviously he's a killer.
That's not in question here.

02:42.678 --> 02:44.245
The question is catching him
and proving it,

02:44.279 --> 02:45.446
and you are not helping.

02:45.481 --> 02:47.385
On top of assaulting one of my men.

02:47.410 --> 02:48.677
But we'll leave that aside.

02:48.702 --> 02:51.319
So... you can tell us
how you knew what you knew

02:51.353 --> 02:53.321
or I can detain you for obstruction.

02:57.359 --> 03:00.561
Article 1 Section 2B of the
California Constitution says

03:00.596 --> 03:02.663
all kinds of things
about press and immunity.

03:02.698 --> 03:04.399
You want me to pull that up for you?

03:04.433 --> 03:06.067
If he kills another girl,

03:06.101 --> 03:08.936
and you knew something
that could help her,

03:08.971 --> 03:10.271
you can forget obstruction...

03:10.305 --> 03:13.040
I will nail you for complicity.

03:18.247 --> 03:20.648
After you. Come on. Let's go.

03:22.217 --> 03:23.651
Why don't we try the truth?

03:23.685 --> 03:25.787
'Cause I can't
help Serena from a psych ward.

03:25.821 --> 03:28.089
So who does he kill tonight?

03:28.123 --> 03:30.825
Nobody claimed the body. No ID.

03:30.859 --> 03:32.360
They found the body in a dumpster

03:32.394 --> 03:33.494
in the Financial District.

03:33.529 --> 03:34.629
Maybe we scared him off.

03:34.663 --> 03:35.663
Want to count on that?

03:41.937 --> 03:45.573
She was wearing a blue wig,
and this fuzzy jacket,

03:45.607 --> 03:47.108
short, to here.

03:47.142 --> 03:49.610
We found a napkin in her pocket.

03:49.645 --> 03:52.847
No name. No number.
Just a three-headed dog.

03:52.881 --> 03:55.716
Cerberus. Guardian of the underworld.

03:55.751 --> 03:58.352
You know your mythology.

03:58.387 --> 03:59.821
I know my underworld.

03:59.855 --> 04:02.223
Could be an unlisted gentleman's
club she worked out of.

04:02.257 --> 04:03.291
Cops never found it.

04:03.325 --> 04:04.859
Kinda people that go to that kinda club

04:04.893 --> 04:06.327
don't usually talk to the cops.

04:06.361 --> 04:08.062
Yeah, but they talk to you.

04:08.096 --> 04:10.731
- They talk to people that talk to me.
- Nice.

04:10.766 --> 04:12.266
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

04:12.301 --> 04:15.870
Whoa. Who did that?
Oh, my God. That's crazy.

04:20.608 --> 04:22.777
You recall the time of death?

04:22.811 --> 04:24.512
No.

04:24.546 --> 04:28.216
The next time I'm headed for a
rewind, I'll take better notes.

04:28.250 --> 04:29.350
So what's the plan?

04:29.384 --> 04:31.519
You call me when you find
the three-headed dog,

04:31.553 --> 04:34.589
we go there,

04:34.623 --> 04:35.590
and we wait.

04:40.162 --> 04:41.362
What?

04:41.396 --> 04:44.636
That wasn't too shabby,
when you stabbed him with the pen.

04:44.729 --> 04:46.200
A lot of good it did.

04:46.235 --> 04:48.073
First time,
they found her in the dumpster.

04:48.098 --> 04:49.999
The second time,
he left her in an alley.

04:50.205 --> 04:52.240
We moved the needle on fate.

04:52.274 --> 04:55.877
So this time Serena drowns
in a lake instead of the bay?

There are more
unlisted clubs in this city

05:56.772 --> 05:58.406
than there are men who moisturize!

05:58.440 --> 06:01.008
If anybody could find the hypodermic
needle in that haystack...

06:01.043 --> 06:02.176
Just where I love going.

06:02.210 --> 06:04.111
Back to the swamp you hauled me out of.

06:04.146 --> 06:06.514
- Afraid of old enemies?
- Worse.

06:06.548 --> 06:07.915
Old friends.

06:07.950 --> 06:11.319
Where are you headed, while I'm
hunting three-headed dogs?

06:11.353 --> 06:14.055
I'm going to make sure I don't
squander my second chance.

06:26.068 --> 06:28.669
I didn't lie to you.

06:28.704 --> 06:29.971
I was in the field,

06:30.005 --> 06:33.174
following a tip on that story
I'm doing about the killer.

06:33.208 --> 06:36.744
It got late and, uh, things got crazy.

06:36.778 --> 06:39.480
Mm. You know, watching you
the last couple days,

06:39.514 --> 06:41.015
I know all about crazy.

06:41.049 --> 06:42.583
I'm worried.

06:45.220 --> 06:47.722
When's the last time
you saw your therapist?

06:47.756 --> 06:49.824
I don't know.

06:49.858 --> 06:51.392
Uh...

06:51.426 --> 06:52.960
Too long.

06:55.163 --> 06:57.264
- Promise me you'll go see her.
- I promise.

06:57.299 --> 06:59.767
Mostly I just need to get rest.

06:59.801 --> 07:01.602
I'm gonna stay in today
and snuggle with Serena.

07:01.637 --> 07:02.637
You are?!

07:02.671 --> 07:04.405
That's right, angel.

07:04.439 --> 07:09.176
We can curl up and see
what the Mad Hatter's up to.

07:09.211 --> 07:11.579
You're staying home from work
to read with me?

07:11.613 --> 07:15.383
Until I have to go out later on
to work on my story.

07:15.417 --> 07:18.119
Are you feeling all right?

07:29.665 --> 07:31.899
Hey, Ruby!

07:31.933 --> 07:33.634
- Move over.
- Uncle Nico.

07:34.536 --> 07:36.404
Why'd you come to my school?

07:36.438 --> 07:38.506
I missed ya.

07:41.209 --> 07:43.310
What's got you down, sweetheart?

07:43.345 --> 07:49.383
I'm not allowed to see my friend.
And I'm scared about my dad.

07:49.418 --> 07:51.585
Yeah, me too.

07:51.620 --> 07:56.824
If I was Elsa, I would make
a blizzard over the whole jail

07:56.858 --> 07:59.427
and I would turn
all the guards into snowmen

07:59.461 --> 08:03.130
and my dad and I,
we would skate away on the ice,

08:03.165 --> 08:04.765
and I'd bring him back to my palace

08:04.800 --> 08:07.134
where no one would ever find us.

08:08.870 --> 08:10.337
But I'm not Elsa.

08:10.372 --> 08:14.341
It's just me and I have
16p11.2 deletion syndrome

08:14.376 --> 08:17.211
which makes me trip all the time.

08:20.048 --> 08:23.150
Okay! That's second bell!
Inside, everyone!

08:23.185 --> 08:25.386
Well, that was quick.

08:25.420 --> 08:27.521
I'll see you soon, okay?

08:27.556 --> 08:30.858
My uncle Nico came to see me,
Mr. DeBray.

08:30.892 --> 08:32.927
He missed me so he came to see me.

08:32.961 --> 08:34.929
Oh, that's wonderful, Ruby.

08:34.962 --> 08:36.563
Nice to meet you, Uncle Nico.

08:36.597 --> 08:37.698
Pleasure's mine.

08:37.732 --> 08:39.200
Hey. Come on.

08:45.173 --> 08:47.608
Goodbye, Elsa.

09:43.965 --> 09:46.767
<i>Susanna was strangled
before she was stabbed,</i>

09:46.802 --> 09:48.235
<i>with the scarf she was wearing.</i>

09:48.270 --> 09:50.571
<i>There were yellow silk fibers
in the wounds on her neck.</i>

09:50.605 --> 09:52.640
<i>Uh, is my son's DNA on the scarf too?</i>

09:52.674 --> 09:54.608
<i>Like you say it is on the knife?</i>

09:55.781 --> 09:58.045
<i>We don't know. The scarf is missing.</i>

09:58.079 --> 10:00.548
<i>- Of course it is.
- Mrs. Jackson...</i>

10:00.582 --> 10:03.851
<i>If you find that scarf,
you'll find the real killer.</i>

10:03.885 --> 10:06.187
<i>You cops have all the time in the world</i>

10:06.221 --> 10:09.490
<i>to scare him into confessing,
but the... the murder weapon?</i>

10:09.524 --> 10:12.860
<i>"Sorry, ma'am, it's missing."</i>

10:14.796 --> 10:16.797
Serena! Lunch!

10:57.272 --> 10:59.039
Hold the fort for a sec?

10:59.074 --> 11:01.442
I'll be right back.

11:01.476 --> 11:03.177
Okay?

11:09.284 --> 11:11.085

11:49.464 --> 11:50.831
Jenny rocks the world.

11:50.865 --> 11:53.066
The napkin is from Hounds of Hell.

11:53.101 --> 11:54.968
A discreet club
in the Financial District

11:55.003 --> 11:56.837
where the unpardonable
do the unspeakable

11:56.871 --> 11:57.905
<i>with the unmentionable.</i>

11:57.939 --> 11:59.339
Sounds like your kind of place.

12:01.609 --> 12:02.843
Hey...

12:02.877 --> 12:05.546
There's this thing that killers do.

12:05.580 --> 12:06.980
They kill people.

12:07.015 --> 12:08.515
And?

12:08.550 --> 12:10.851
<i>You know how much you want Serena alive?</i>

12:10.885 --> 12:13.654
That's close to how
much she wants you alive.

12:13.688 --> 12:15.322
<i>Let me go alone.</i>

12:15.356 --> 12:16.790
<i>No way.</i>

12:16.825 --> 12:18.659
Like Marjorie said,

12:18.693 --> 12:22.996
for one to live, one has to die.

12:23.031 --> 12:25.065
I'll meet you in 10 minutes.

12:29.437 --> 12:30.871
Hey...

12:30.905 --> 12:32.973
I just got her to sleep, so...

12:33.007 --> 12:35.642
loud noises
are punishable by guillotine.

12:35.677 --> 12:36.543
Yeah.

12:36.578 --> 12:38.278
What's that?

12:38.313 --> 12:41.348
Uh, persistent citizen.

12:42.750 --> 12:45.085
I have to go into work.

12:45.119 --> 12:47.254
We're doing research
on victim number six.

12:47.288 --> 12:50.290
- Six?
- When did another one happen?

12:50.325 --> 12:51.859
Sorry. Five.

12:51.893 --> 12:54.528
I just... It's this story.

12:54.562 --> 12:58.031
I just got, um... killer on the brain.

12:58.066 --> 13:00.100
You look handsome.

13:00.134 --> 13:01.568
You're beautiful.

13:04.172 --> 13:05.539
Mm.

13:05.573 --> 13:07.641
I wish I could stay.

13:07.675 --> 13:09.443
Yeah, me too.

13:11.613 --> 13:14.147
Be safe.

13:14.182 --> 13:15.582
I'll try.

13:44.145 --> 13:47.281
Hello, daughter unit.

13:47.315 --> 13:50.984
- Hello, father unit.
- Hi.

13:51.019 --> 13:53.887
Aww. That's nice.

13:53.922 --> 13:56.823
I'm sorry to wake you up,

13:56.858 --> 13:59.359
but turns out I need
that yellow scarf after all.

13:59.394 --> 14:01.328
And I'm wondering if you've seen it.

14:01.362 --> 14:03.630
- Yes!
- You did?

14:08.670 --> 14:10.637
I wanted to play with it,

14:10.672 --> 14:13.307
but it had all these yucky stains on it,

14:13.341 --> 14:17.778
so I washed it all clean.

14:17.812 --> 14:19.780
You did.

14:22.483 --> 14:23.917
Okay.

14:23.952 --> 14:26.687
Let's, uh... let's go back to bed, okay?

14:29.591 --> 14:32.593
There we go.

14:32.627 --> 14:34.595
Love you.

14:37.398 --> 14:40.500
Here. In case you lost your tracker.

14:40.535 --> 14:42.035
What's the range on this thing?

14:42.070 --> 14:43.503
Somewhere around global.

14:43.538 --> 14:45.872
Okay. Welcome to Hounds of Hell.

14:45.907 --> 14:47.040
Fire?

14:47.075 --> 14:48.642
Oh, my God!

14:48.676 --> 14:50.277
She could be in there!

14:50.311 --> 14:51.812
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hold on! Hold on!

14:51.846 --> 14:53.513
Wait! Hey!

14:53.991 --> 14:55.928
You can't run into a fire!

15:25.613 --> 15:27.614
Help me! Please!

15:35.456 --> 15:37.290
Help me! Help me!

15:41.095 --> 15:43.597
Who are you?

15:43.631 --> 15:44.965
Why are we back here?

15:44.999 --> 15:46.867
Because you're in danger.

15:46.901 --> 15:48.935
What are you doing?!
We have to get out of here!

15:48.970 --> 15:51.838
There's no fire. It's just smoke.

15:51.873 --> 15:53.340
He did that
to keep us from stopping him.

15:53.374 --> 15:55.342
What are you talking about? Who are you?

15:55.376 --> 15:57.577
We're with the police.

15:57.612 --> 16:02.549
We have information someone's
planning on hurting you tonight.

16:02.583 --> 16:05.185
Did you arrange to meet a man here?

16:05.219 --> 16:06.853
What... prove you're the police.

16:06.888 --> 16:08.188
Well, you can believe us...

16:08.222 --> 16:10.257
Or you can end up in the news,
like the last five girls.

16:10.291 --> 16:12.392
Are you meeting someone here tonight?!

16:14.362 --> 16:16.697
Yeah. Yeah. But I don't know who.

16:16.738 --> 16:18.597
A guy called and asked me
if I would be here tonight.

16:18.622 --> 16:19.584
How'd he get your number?

16:19.608 --> 16:21.608
If a guy wants my number,
he knows how to get it.

16:25.740 --> 16:28.075
That's his caller ID.

16:28.109 --> 16:30.143
Put it on speaker.

16:35.083 --> 16:36.283
Hello?

16:36.317 --> 16:39.019
<i>Hey, Mimi. Sorry I got held up.</i>

16:39.053 --> 16:42.155
<i>How about you meet me at
Hey Venus in a half an hour?</i>

16:42.190 --> 16:45.892
Yes.

16:45.927 --> 16:48.161
Sure. I'll see you there.

16:49.464 --> 16:50.897
Now what?

16:50.932 --> 16:53.600
He wants to meet his date at Hey Venus.

16:53.634 --> 16:56.103
Well... that's where she's gonna be.

16:56.137 --> 16:59.806
What, you're just gonna
throw her out there like bait?

17:04.112 --> 17:05.912
No.

17:10.318 --> 17:12.185
We're not doing this on our own.

17:18.792 --> 17:19.826
What is it?

17:19.861 --> 17:21.661
You have a minute to catch a killer?

17:25.500 --> 17:28.635
Actually, it's, uh... it's occupied.

17:37.278 --> 17:38.845
Wow.

17:38.880 --> 17:40.514
You should call for backup.

17:40.548 --> 17:42.582
I can handle myself.

17:42.617 --> 17:45.452
It's not you I'm worried about.

17:45.486 --> 17:46.386
Let's go get him.

17:50.093 --> 17:51.499
You're all insane.

17:51.671 --> 17:53.671
Yeah. Yeah, but... with a plan.

17:53.718 --> 17:55.641
Which I am not signing on to
until you tell me

17:55.675 --> 17:57.442
what you know and how you know it.

17:57.467 --> 17:59.234
Fine.

17:59.269 --> 18:00.669
I lived through an alternate timeline

18:00.703 --> 18:01.904
in which my daughter was drowned

18:01.938 --> 18:03.338
by the man who's killing these women.

18:03.373 --> 18:06.108
It was so excruciatingly
horrible that I killed myself,

18:06.142 --> 18:08.243
but instead of dying,
this guy fished me out

18:08.278 --> 18:09.945
and I woke up a week
before I lost my daughter.

18:09.979 --> 18:11.814
That's why I know what I know.

18:11.848 --> 18:13.382
- Because...
- Because we went to the future.

18:13.416 --> 18:15.184
- Yeah.
- Which is why we teamed up.

18:15.218 --> 18:16.819
'Cause people that fall through
the time-space continuum,

18:16.853 --> 18:18.120
they gotta stick together, you know?

18:18.154 --> 18:20.222
Oh, I could arrest you both
right now for so many things.

18:20.256 --> 18:22.391
But first, let's get this guy
when he shows up at Hey Venus.

18:23.593 --> 18:26.462
Well, you had your hands
on the killer last night,

18:26.496 --> 18:29.231
which is more than I can say
for any of us.

18:29.265 --> 18:30.999
Thank you.

18:31.034 --> 18:34.403
We are no more than 10 feet
from you every second.

18:34.437 --> 18:36.738
Yes.

18:36.773 --> 18:40.709
Come on. I'll have
an officer take you home.

18:40.743 --> 18:42.711
I want you to take Mimi home.

18:42.745 --> 18:46.949
I'm sure the Captain has
officers she can throw on that.

18:46.983 --> 18:50.085
I only trust you. Please.

18:50.119 --> 18:53.222
We can't change anything
if we don't keep her alive.

18:53.256 --> 18:56.258
Be careful.

18:56.292 --> 18:57.793
You too.

19:17.680 --> 19:20.382
Any idea why a killer
would put you on his list?

19:20.408 --> 19:23.477
Maybe he's my fairy god mother
granting a wish.

19:23.520 --> 19:25.787
Come on. Don't say that.

19:25.822 --> 19:29.224
Don't worry, I don't have the guts yet.

19:29.259 --> 19:30.959
Give me two years.

19:30.994 --> 19:33.729
That's when he's gonna be old
enough to come looking for me.

19:34.908 --> 19:37.088
It's better that I'm gone.

19:37.385 --> 19:40.736
He can live his life thinking
I was some poor college student

19:40.770 --> 19:42.538
who wanted him to have a better life.

19:42.708 --> 19:45.208
Instead of a party girl

19:45.286 --> 19:47.876
who didn't have the guts to take him on.

19:49.148 --> 19:51.609
- 16?
- Soon. Yeah.

19:51.781 --> 19:53.148
Yeah...

19:53.182 --> 19:55.067
I have a niece that's gonna be 14.

19:56.978 --> 19:59.543
- Does she like sweaters?
- Yeah.

19:59.568 --> 20:02.624
There's... this stupid thing that I do

20:02.659 --> 20:04.593
- every year on his birthday.
- Look at that.

20:04.627 --> 20:07.732
Here's this year's. I don't know.
Would your niece wear this?

20:07.757 --> 20:09.331
I usually give it to a thrift store.

20:09.365 --> 20:10.899
You made that yourself?

20:10.934 --> 20:12.668
The only thing I learned from my mom.

20:12.702 --> 20:16.104
That and how to let a man
light your cigarette.

20:16.139 --> 20:17.839
Take it. Please.

20:18.230 --> 20:20.342
It's very beautiful. Thank you.

20:22.679 --> 20:25.180
Um, did you box somebody in?

20:25.206 --> 20:26.607
I think you're getting towed.

20:31.083 --> 20:33.294
Hey! Hold on! I'm coming down!

20:33.319 --> 20:35.157
D... just... hold on!

20:35.544 --> 20:37.526
Oh, wait, wait, wait!

20:37.560 --> 20:39.795
For downstairs, to get back in.

20:39.829 --> 20:41.597
Take this.

20:41.631 --> 20:44.199
- Lock the door.
- Okay.

20:56.179 --> 20:59.114
Waiting long?

20:59.139 --> 21:02.196
- No.
- You're just the girl I'm looking for.

21:04.821 --> 21:06.421
Police! On the ground!

21:06.456 --> 21:08.223
She's a hooker! What's the big deal?!

21:13.529 --> 21:16.398
No stab wound. It's not him.

21:38.388 --> 21:40.622
Mimi?

21:53.453 --> 21:55.866
_

21:59.776 --> 22:02.106
Mimi?

22:42.294 --> 22:44.021
<i>Nice to meet you, Uncle Nico.</i>

22:44.521 --> 22:46.096
What does this have to do with Ruby?

22:46.182 --> 22:48.550
Everything. And nothing.

22:50.869 --> 22:53.871
If I get locked up, who's gonna
be the man in Ruby's life?

22:53.905 --> 22:55.072
You?

23:25.637 --> 23:26.971
Stay here.

23:36.191 --> 23:37.325
Lost him?

23:37.359 --> 23:39.060
Yeah, but we found each other again.

23:39.232 --> 23:41.729
Life got dull without you.

23:41.857 --> 23:43.531
I loved it.

25:01.777 --> 25:05.213
You're the teacher...
from Ruby's school.

25:05.247 --> 25:06.944
Why are you following me?

25:07.132 --> 25:09.017
How do you always know
where I'm going to be?

25:27.343 --> 25:30.101
Hey! Hey! Hey!

25:30.126 --> 25:31.524
Let me out!

25:33.375 --> 25:35.710
I'm trapped! Get me out! I'm trapped!

25:35.744 --> 25:37.531
Get me out of here!

25:38.093 --> 25:40.048
I'm trapped! Get me out!

25:42.984 --> 25:45.920
H-Hey, I smell... I smell gas!

25:45.945 --> 25:47.488
Get me out of here!

25:47.523 --> 25:49.724
I got so much work to do!

25:49.758 --> 25:51.059
Please!

25:51.084 --> 25:53.478
<i>You can't win until the price is paid.</i>

25:53.517 --> 25:55.971
<i>For one to live, one must die.</i>

25:58.000 --> 26:00.802
No! No, no, no! No, no, no! Please!

26:00.992 --> 26:03.571
No! No!

26:03.605 --> 26:05.073
It was for the children!

26:05.107 --> 26:06.874
Let me out!

26:10.446 --> 26:13.181
Please! No! No! No!

26:13.215 --> 26:14.709
Get me out!

26:14.817 --> 26:16.928
Don't kill me!

26:16.985 --> 26:19.387
Please! Let me out!

26:24.393 --> 26:26.394
No! He has to die! No!

26:26.428 --> 26:28.362
It's not the way! It's not the way!

26:28.397 --> 26:30.498
Stop! He has to die! No!

26:33.035 --> 26:35.536
Get me out! Get me out! Get me out!

26:35.571 --> 26:37.338
Get me out!

26:40.881 --> 26:43.044
Grab my legs! My legs!

26:56.691 --> 26:57.859
No!

26:57.893 --> 26:59.927
He has to die!

27:20.906 --> 27:22.504
How could you let him live?

27:23.764 --> 27:25.559
All the women he's killed...

27:26.046 --> 27:28.328
and Serena...

27:29.534 --> 27:31.292
Governor's got nothing on you.

27:31.659 --> 27:33.730
He believes in the death penalty.

27:34.035 --> 27:35.870
You believe in do-it-yourself.

27:37.772 --> 27:39.848
You risked your life for a killer.

27:40.630 --> 27:42.810
What's the Ruby connection?

27:42.844 --> 27:46.347
Why Serena?
He dies, the answers die with him.

27:48.362 --> 27:49.529
Caught a good break.

27:49.554 --> 27:50.821
Mimi's alive.

27:50.846 --> 27:53.289
She's in a coma,
but she'll pull through.

27:54.078 --> 27:55.609
He didn't kill her?

27:55.641 --> 27:57.797
Did his best. But nope.

27:58.032 --> 28:00.195
She fingers him, and...

28:00.339 --> 28:02.073
You hear that?

28:02.117 --> 28:03.733
There's no way out of the noose.

28:03.892 --> 28:06.060
He can't hurt Serena.

28:06.654 --> 28:09.210
You know how my husband became the DA?

28:09.803 --> 28:12.624
By never being sure there was
no way out of the noose.

28:17.379 --> 28:19.280
Why am I the one under arrest?

28:19.846 --> 28:22.024
<i>She's</i> the one who attacked <i>me.</i>

28:26.828 --> 28:28.818
Has anybody looked at that?

28:29.324 --> 28:31.192
The EMTs wanted to bandage it,

28:31.226 --> 28:33.761
but I told them
chicks go crazy over my scars.

28:33.795 --> 28:35.963
Yeah.

28:35.997 --> 28:38.265
Nothing sexier than festering infection.

28:38.945 --> 28:41.669
There's glass
and God knows what in there.

28:41.703 --> 28:42.837
Careful.

28:42.871 --> 28:44.472
Hey, just hold still.

28:46.208 --> 28:47.674
You sound like my mother.

28:47.753 --> 28:50.711
Yeah. Well, every mom
is everybody's mother.

28:51.245 --> 28:52.646
Ow.

28:53.768 --> 28:57.418
Serena really drew the long
straw when she got you.

28:57.452 --> 29:00.187
The oceans of hell you've had to
slog through for her...

29:00.222 --> 29:02.275
Your mother would do
the same thing for you.

29:02.884 --> 29:04.925
She would if I was my brother.

29:11.399 --> 29:13.167
Wh... Where's Serena?

29:16.538 --> 29:19.507
I, uh... I had Barry come over.

29:20.392 --> 29:23.077
Uh, Captain... Sarneau, right?

29:23.111 --> 29:24.545
Mm. Hello, Mr. Price.

29:24.579 --> 29:26.223
Uh, is the man you're holding the killer?

29:26.248 --> 29:28.629
- All five women?
- Mm-hmm. No question whatsoever.

29:28.654 --> 29:29.731
Good.

29:29.759 --> 29:31.719
Without your wife, we never
would've collared him.

29:31.753 --> 29:33.721
Do you need anything more
from Mrs. Price?

29:33.755 --> 29:35.790
Nah, she's given her statement,
I just need her to sign it.

29:35.824 --> 29:38.325
Good. I'll take her home,
and then I'll give you a call.

29:38.360 --> 29:39.894
We'll get the charges
in front of Judge Vasquez

29:39.928 --> 29:41.095
before he has his morning coffee.

29:41.129 --> 29:42.897
No leaks to the press until we indict.

29:42.931 --> 29:44.498
- Okay.
- Good. You ready?

29:44.533 --> 29:46.440
- Yes.
- Good.

29:47.035 --> 29:48.969
Thank you.

29:55.177 --> 29:58.040
- I put the man's brother on death row.
- I know.

29:58.065 --> 29:59.765
- So what does he want from you?
- Nothing.

29:59.790 --> 30:01.391
He was just helping me out
with my story,

30:01.416 --> 30:03.153
as a private detective.

30:03.351 --> 30:04.952
- It's just a coincidence.
- Coincidence.

30:04.986 --> 30:06.320
Two days after his mother ambushed me

30:06.354 --> 30:07.888
in front of my office.
But let's move on.

30:07.923 --> 30:09.690
What kind of story calls for

30:09.724 --> 30:10.925
dressing up like a $10 hooker

30:10.959 --> 30:12.993
and burning suspects alive
in the middle of the night?

30:13.028 --> 30:15.229
We had a chance to
catch him, and we caught him.

30:15.263 --> 30:16.897
"We?"

30:16.932 --> 30:18.399
Yeah, me and the police.

30:18.433 --> 30:19.900
And Nico Jackson.

30:19.935 --> 30:21.335
I've had an hour of sleep
in three days...

30:21.369 --> 30:23.137
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

30:23.171 --> 30:26.366
I'm worried about you.
I'm just trying to understand.

30:26.508 --> 30:28.577
You know I'm proud of you.

30:28.827 --> 30:30.874
For helping catch him.

30:31.746 --> 30:33.866
Just make sure he stays caught.

30:47.429 --> 30:50.130
Nothing? You have nothing for me?

30:51.488 --> 30:52.855
Hm.

30:53.001 --> 30:54.568
Well, silence is your client's right,

30:54.603 --> 30:56.670
but you know what silence
looks like to a jury.

30:56.705 --> 30:58.272
I can't compel my client to speak.

30:59.020 --> 31:00.621
But I can speak.

31:00.926 --> 31:02.943
And I can tell you that
my client has now been attacked,

31:02.978 --> 31:04.221
two nights in a row, by the same woman.

31:04.246 --> 31:05.312
He abducted her.

31:05.347 --> 31:07.248
Yes, I understand that
she's making that claim.

31:07.282 --> 31:09.545
Which is substantiated only
by her own statement.

31:09.592 --> 31:12.996
And yet somehow, you're hoping to
pin five murders on my client.

31:13.716 --> 31:16.522
Do you have any other questions
for me, Captain?

31:19.394 --> 31:21.029
How many days are we losing you for?

31:21.054 --> 31:22.997
<i>Just until I know
Serena's completely recovered</i>

31:23.031 --> 31:24.298
from her allergy attack.

31:24.332 --> 31:26.934
Tell Auntie Mara I send her
a big hug and a kiss!

31:26.968 --> 31:29.570
Tell her I hear it
and I send her one right back.

31:29.604 --> 31:31.005
Come back as soon as you can, okay?

31:31.039 --> 31:33.073
<i>I will. Hug from me too.</i>

31:33.108 --> 31:35.075
We're all set, angel.

31:35.110 --> 31:37.945
You, me, and whatever
we feel like doing.

31:37.979 --> 31:40.234
But I actually want
to go to school today.

31:40.259 --> 31:41.548
We have art,

31:41.583 --> 31:43.250
and I haven't finished my diorama yet.

31:43.285 --> 31:45.252
We can make our own dioramas.

31:45.743 --> 31:47.021
Hi.

31:47.055 --> 31:49.822
Uh, we're all set with Vasquez,
as soon as we...

31:53.670 --> 31:54.795
Mm-hmm.

31:54.829 --> 31:55.829
What's wrong?

31:55.864 --> 31:57.831
We're on our way.

31:57.866 --> 32:00.000
- Did he escape?
- Not that bad. But almost.

32:06.701 --> 32:08.162
Yeah?

32:08.256 --> 32:09.765
<i>You're not gonna like this.</i>

32:09.878 --> 32:11.478
Well, that's an easy guess.

32:11.513 --> 32:13.747
I don't like anything
before 11:00 in the morning.

32:13.894 --> 32:15.950
Not a single chromosome of DeBray's DNA

32:15.984 --> 32:17.456
showed up in Mimi's apartment.

32:19.213 --> 32:20.597
What?

32:20.655 --> 32:23.891
Your exact words were
"no question whatsoever."

32:23.925 --> 32:26.393
I was going on the information
that we had at the time.

32:26.428 --> 32:28.429
And now I have to go in front of
a superior-court judge

32:28.463 --> 32:30.264
and say yes, Your Honor,
there's no physical evidence

32:30.298 --> 32:33.667
tying the suspect I've filed
charges against to this crime.

32:33.702 --> 32:34.935
Or any of the other murders.

32:34.970 --> 32:37.271
- What about the clothes?
- Nothing.

32:37.305 --> 32:39.406
Oh, come on. He...
He had her blood on his jacket.

32:39.441 --> 32:41.442
It was... It was green. It had a zipper.

32:41.476 --> 32:43.177
What was he wearing
when you arrested him?

32:43.590 --> 32:46.022
Uh... navy shirt.

32:46.047 --> 32:47.414
He took off the jacket
while he was running.

32:47.449 --> 32:50.217
We searched every square
millimeter between Mimi's place

32:50.251 --> 32:52.067
and where he got in the car
for the knife.

32:52.092 --> 32:53.921
Not likely we'd miss a bloody jacket.

32:53.955 --> 32:55.589
He could've tossed it in a car.

32:55.623 --> 32:57.091
Did you search every car?

32:57.125 --> 32:58.959
I cannot build a case on could have.

32:58.994 --> 33:00.961
You can build a case on witnesses, Tom.

33:00.996 --> 33:02.096
- Witnesses.
- Yes.

33:02.130 --> 33:03.163
Right.

33:03.198 --> 33:04.965
One's in a coma.

33:05.000 --> 33:07.735
One has admitted to assaulting
the suspect. Twice.

33:07.769 --> 33:11.071
One was fired from the police
for the brutal beating of a citizen.

33:14.542 --> 33:15.642
So either somebody finds

33:15.677 --> 33:17.478
a green jacket
soaked in the victim's DNA

33:17.512 --> 33:19.413
by tonight
or I'm calling off the hearing.

33:19.447 --> 33:22.049
Tom, there has to be
another way to charge him.

33:22.083 --> 33:23.250
- Charge him?
- Yeah.

33:23.284 --> 33:25.886
Once I cancel the hearing
for lack of evidence,

33:25.920 --> 33:27.788
I won't have a way to hold him.

34:09.411 --> 34:10.460
<i>He's a trophy keeper.</i>

34:14.197 --> 34:16.800
The team tore this guy's
apartment to pieces.

34:16.824 --> 34:18.889
All right, if he had a girl's ring
in there, they would've found it.

34:19.751 --> 34:22.063
"The team" couldn't find their own ass

34:22.097 --> 34:24.417
with GPS and a bloodhound.

34:24.972 --> 34:27.702
Come on, hermano, all I'm asking for

34:27.735 --> 34:30.378
is the code to the lock on
Haskell's apartment.

34:30.543 --> 34:33.433
I'm sorry to remind you,
but you ain't a cop anymore.

34:33.569 --> 34:35.570
Anything you dig up
blows the chain of custody.

34:35.594 --> 34:37.994
Anything I dig up goes right
back where I dug it.

34:38.027 --> 34:40.663
And then you get an irresistible hunch,

34:40.697 --> 34:42.899
you march in all official-like,

34:42.933 --> 34:44.900
you bring home the inculpatory bacon,

34:44.926 --> 34:48.061
and you get the honor and glory
you so richly deserve.

34:49.344 --> 34:51.391
If you get caught tampering,

34:51.909 --> 34:54.110
he walks and you're felons.

34:57.214 --> 34:58.981
Give me the code.

35:38.954 --> 35:40.655
Lock's intact, ma'am.

35:40.680 --> 35:42.085
You sure the sound was from in here?

35:42.110 --> 35:44.193
Believe me, officer,
the walls in this building?

35:44.227 --> 35:45.962
I know what shoes they were wearing.

35:46.004 --> 35:48.050
Sounds pretty quiet.

35:48.075 --> 35:51.233
Of course they're quiet now.
They know we're here.

35:53.403 --> 35:56.138
If somebody was in here,
they must've slipped out.

36:03.218 --> 36:05.047
This is Officer 249.

36:05.132 --> 36:07.249
We've done a walk-through. All clear.

36:17.698 --> 36:19.154
Found them in the bathroom.

36:19.179 --> 36:22.536
It... it was just a feeling you had?

36:22.872 --> 36:26.036
Yeah, like a, uh... a hunch.

36:26.403 --> 36:27.770
Is that a technical term?

36:28.060 --> 36:30.231
These could be trophies he took
from the first five victims.

36:30.256 --> 36:31.240
Mm.

36:31.274 --> 36:33.442
I'm sure the families
will recognize them.

36:33.477 --> 36:34.777
- Tom...
- Hm?

36:34.811 --> 36:36.445
Can you bring them in here?

36:36.480 --> 36:37.980
I can make that happen.

36:38.015 --> 36:39.782
<i>Take a close look at
the ring and the earring.</i>

36:39.816 --> 36:41.384
<i>Tell us if it's possible the items</i>

36:41.418 --> 36:43.452
<i>belonged to your sister, Mr. Lachoisto,</i>

36:43.487 --> 36:45.221
<i>or your daughter, Mr. and Mrs. Shrain.</i>

36:45.255 --> 36:48.290
<i>We believe we have the man
who killed your loved ones.</i>

36:48.325 --> 36:50.526
<i>A verifiable identification
of this jewelry</i>

36:50.560 --> 36:52.021
<i>can help us put him away.</i>

36:53.864 --> 36:55.724
Thank you.

36:57.271 --> 37:00.102
Would you take a look at these
please, Mr. Lachoisto?

37:00.216 --> 37:03.153
Did either of these items
belong to your sister?

37:05.909 --> 37:07.977
I've never seen either of these.

37:08.011 --> 37:09.947
<i>Fiona almost never wore jewelry.</i>

37:09.972 --> 37:11.047
<i>According to a witness,</i>

37:11.081 --> 37:13.516
<i>your sister was wearing a ring
the night that she was killed.</i>

37:13.550 --> 37:15.017
<i>Not this one.</i>

37:15.052 --> 37:18.554
Look at the initials on the band.
Who the hell is A.H.?

37:18.685 --> 37:22.088
Wait. Uh, sir, can you please
look at the jewelry again?

37:22.113 --> 37:24.693
- Laura...
- Just wait. Wait.

37:24.728 --> 37:25.895
Um...

37:26.443 --> 37:30.043
Maybe A.H. was her boyfriend.
Can you think for me?

37:30.068 --> 37:32.835
Please, just... just look at the bag!

37:32.869 --> 37:34.670
- Look at the ba...
- Laura, that's enough.

37:38.708 --> 37:40.876
<i>I'm sorry. Captain, thank
the families for coming in.</i>

37:40.911 --> 37:42.493
Of course.

37:44.462 --> 37:46.048
Any luck on the bloody jacket?

37:49.459 --> 37:51.285
All right.

37:52.324 --> 37:54.056
You know I have no choice.

37:58.095 --> 38:00.062
I have to order the release
of the detainee.

38:00.691 --> 38:03.199
I'm not giving up. I just don't
have the evidence yet.

38:32.863 --> 38:35.184
Thank you.

38:36.900 --> 38:39.068
Laura... Laura! Laura!

38:39.102 --> 38:40.369
Laura!

38:40.403 --> 38:41.670
What's the code?

38:41.700 --> 38:43.590
Uh, 2215.

38:43.640 --> 38:44.740
<i>It's not opening!</i>

38:46.021 --> 38:48.077
Confess now. You killed them all.

38:48.111 --> 38:49.845
Why do you keep trying to kill me?

38:49.880 --> 38:52.814
Car, gun, pen, fire...

38:52.839 --> 38:53.682
I... y...

38:53.717 --> 38:55.784
Wh... What is your
sick obsession with me?

38:55.819 --> 38:57.920
The code's not working! Laura!

38:57.954 --> 38:59.355
If you live...

38:59.389 --> 39:01.549
- ...my daughter dies.
- Laura!

39:01.858 --> 39:04.104
I saw her dead! After you killed her!

39:04.227 --> 39:06.025
Ruby's my favorite student.

39:06.129 --> 39:08.197
Why would I hurt her best friend?

39:09.666 --> 39:11.800
Laura! Laura!

39:13.444 --> 39:15.245
You need to take the safety off.

39:16.773 --> 39:17.873
Laura!

39:17.908 --> 39:19.742
Give it... Okay, okay, okay!

39:19.776 --> 39:21.977
Okay, okay, okay! Okay, okay, okay!

39:26.560 --> 39:28.638
What the hell?

39:33.570 --> 39:35.436
You have got to get ahold of yourself.

39:35.461 --> 39:37.693
If you let him go, he will kill Serena.

39:37.727 --> 39:40.537
You have gone
completely out of your mind!

39:40.562 --> 39:41.864
- You don't understand.
- Then tell me!

39:41.889 --> 39:43.343
You have no i...

39:43.367 --> 39:45.001
No! No! No!

39:45.025 --> 39:46.659
No, you can't let him go!

39:46.670 --> 39:47.770
- Laura...
- No!

39:47.804 --> 39:49.772
Laura...

39:52.375 --> 39:53.719
If you get arrested,

39:53.810 --> 39:55.946
what do I tell Serena?

40:00.717 --> 40:02.918
I will fix this for you.

40:03.544 --> 40:06.055
But you are going to get help.

40:06.192 --> 40:08.524
Mr. Price,
your wife assaulted a suspected.

40:08.558 --> 40:10.826
My wife has been under
a tremendous amount of stress.

40:10.860 --> 40:12.194
May we keep this a family matter?

40:12.229 --> 40:14.294
- Sir, I...
- I'd be grateful.

40:14.809 --> 40:17.278
Or should I ask the chief of police?

40:17.645 --> 40:20.002
Of course. Sir.

40:23.974 --> 40:27.342
I have to stay and clean up this mess.

40:28.748 --> 40:32.701
You go home, and I'll talk to
you when I get there.

40:32.816 --> 40:34.750
You don't know what you've done.

40:38.488 --> 40:39.888
I love you.

40:50.567 --> 40:52.513
We won't let him out of our sight.

40:52.636 --> 40:54.903
We have to be at the hospital
when Mimi comes to.

40:55.054 --> 40:56.205
I don't trust the police.

40:56.239 --> 40:57.806
We'll call Jenny.
She'll stay on top of Haskell.

40:57.841 --> 41:00.794
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Why is your hand on my person?

41:00.819 --> 41:02.770
Oh, I have a trainload of
questions and you,

41:02.795 --> 41:04.522
as a person of interest
in this screwed-up case,

41:04.547 --> 41:06.482
aren't going anywhere
until I get answers.

41:06.516 --> 41:08.417
All right. How about we downgrade

41:08.451 --> 41:10.386
my classification to witness?

41:10.420 --> 41:11.787
See, the attorney for the suspect

41:11.821 --> 41:14.523
is planning on leveling very
serious charges against you...

41:14.557 --> 41:16.925
- Come on.
- ...for stalking and harassment.

41:16.960 --> 41:18.827
So you can talk to me,

41:19.027 --> 41:21.581
or I can throw you to those dogs.

41:21.652 --> 41:23.198
They can't keep you here.

41:23.233 --> 41:25.034
Yeah, actually they can.

41:25.068 --> 41:26.201
I'll tell my husband...

41:26.236 --> 41:28.170
He'll upgrade me to suspect.

41:28.329 --> 41:30.272
Call Jenny. Stay after Haskell.

41:30.735 --> 41:33.008
Go. Come on.

41:33.192 --> 41:34.725
Okay.

41:34.888 --> 41:37.148
- I'll be okay.
- Okay.

41:55.567 --> 41:57.499
- I am so sorry.
- Are you all right?

41:57.534 --> 42:01.489
Yes, of course.
Apart from being a clumsy oaf.

42:01.571 --> 42:04.153
So sorry. Truly.
