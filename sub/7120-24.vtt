00:12.932 --> 00:15.730
Jake, what am I supposed
to be meditatin' about?

00:15.799 --> 00:16.799
Don't know.

00:16.867 --> 00:20.097
I'm thinkin' of pillows
stuffed with spaghetti.

00:20.168 --> 00:22.500
Clear your minds.

00:34.908 --> 00:36.308
I have to go check on something!

00:36.377 --> 00:37.400
Can we go with?

00:37.477 --> 00:40.968
<i>Perhaps you are
ready to go with.</i>

00:41.045 --> 00:43.536
Guys, you'll need
to put these on.

00:43.613 --> 00:46.104
Pull back your hat.

00:51.150 --> 00:52.150
Neat!

00:53.651 --> 00:55.619
Stay close to me.

01:00.454 --> 01:03.684
Whoa!

01:03.756 --> 01:04.688
At the heart of

01:04.757 --> 01:06.918
this tree is an ancient evil,

01:06.991 --> 01:11.289
held in a prison of Amber...

01:11.359 --> 01:12.359
the Lich!

01:14.495 --> 01:15.894
What's that sound?

01:15.962 --> 01:17.953
He's casting spells...

01:18.030 --> 01:20.055
trying to get in your head and

01:20.131 --> 01:21.393
control your bod.

01:21.464 --> 01:23.432
But these gems are protecting

01:23.499 --> 01:25.467
our minds from his influence.

01:25.533 --> 01:28.626
If we lost the gems,
we'd be defenseless.

01:29.702 --> 01:32.135
He would have full
control over us.

01:32.202 --> 01:33.295
That's freakin' nuts.

01:37.471 --> 01:40.736
Beyond Iceberg Lake
lies the ruins of

01:40.807 --> 01:42.672
the Lich's tower, where he was

01:42.741 --> 01:44.208
converting the planet's

01:44.275 --> 01:47.141
life-force into unholy power to

01:47.209 --> 01:49.905
destroy all of Ooo.

01:49.978 --> 01:51.741
But before he could,

01:51.812 --> 01:54.337
the Legendary Billy
attacked him and

01:54.414 --> 01:55.938
pummeled him into the resin of

01:56.014 --> 01:58.005
this tree.

02:03.551 --> 02:04.381
I...

02:04.451 --> 02:06.351
What the nuts?!

02:11.055 --> 02:12.386
Dude, be a big sword!

02:12.455 --> 02:16.982
Oh! Okay. I'll try.

02:21.859 --> 02:25.123
<i>Quickly, to the
other secret room!</i>

02:26.695 --> 02:28.560
There's only one known weapon

02:28.630 --> 02:30.325
that can harm the Lich...

02:31.998 --> 02:33.727
The gauntlet of the hero.

02:33.799 --> 02:37.165
Billy!

02:37.233 --> 02:39.792
Billy's big ol' beef fingers!

02:39.868 --> 02:42.768
Finn, you have but one chance.

02:42.836 --> 02:45.361
While the Lich isn't
at full power,

02:45.438 --> 02:48.873
you must smite him
with this gauntlet.

02:48.939 --> 02:52.271
His only desire is
to destroy life.

02:52.340 --> 02:55.502
If you fail, he'll
kill everyone!

02:55.575 --> 02:56.804
No!

02:56.876 --> 02:58.707
That will not happen!

03:00.078 --> 03:03.478
Oh, there's something else
that I want you to have.

03:03.546 --> 03:07.413
The Lich's lair is
supposed to be cold.

03:07.481 --> 03:09.915
I just don't want
you to get sick.

03:11.616 --> 03:13.106
Take this sweater.

03:13.184 --> 03:14.549
I made it myself.

03:15.518 --> 03:16.348
I'm not great at knitting,

03:16.418 --> 03:18.113
but please wear it.

03:18.186 --> 03:20.586
I care about you, Finn.

03:21.588 --> 03:23.249
I love it!

03:26.957 --> 03:28.185
Me, too.

03:32.226 --> 03:34.057
<i>Hey, hey, hey!</i>

03:34.127 --> 03:37.493
So, I've been thinking
about this a lot lately.

03:37.562 --> 03:38.723
And, well, uh...

03:38.796 --> 03:39.626
Ooh!

03:39.696 --> 03:41.027
Gosh, I'm so nervous.

03:41.097 --> 03:43.031
Finn and Jake, will you give me

03:43.098 --> 03:46.464
your blessing so I can
marry Princess Bubblegum?

03:46.532 --> 03:48.057
What is wrong with you?!

03:48.134 --> 03:50.294
<i>What's wrong with me?!</i>

03:50.367 --> 03:53.029
No! Not the latch!

03:53.103 --> 03:54.730
Quickly now, Finn.

03:54.803 --> 03:57.033
Track the Lich by
his trail of death.

03:57.105 --> 03:58.231
Here I go!

03:58.305 --> 03:59.432
<i>Here I go!</i>

03:59.506 --> 04:00.768
Be safe!

04:05.242 --> 04:07.301
This is our first "fate
of the world" deal.

04:07.375 --> 04:08.274
Yeah, man.

04:08.343 --> 04:10.277
We got to shut this
fool down, hardcore.

04:10.344 --> 04:12.676
Running this fast makes
my stomach hurt.

04:12.745 --> 04:14.042
Run through it, man!

04:14.113 --> 04:15.113
We got to get beyond

04:15.146 --> 04:16.738
Iceberg Lake before the Lich!

04:20.648 --> 04:22.344
Oh, my! How clumsy of me!

04:22.417 --> 04:24.884
What the heck, Ice King?!

04:24.951 --> 04:26.180
Ooh!

04:26.252 --> 04:27.583
Hey! Wait you guys.

04:27.652 --> 04:29.517
I'm serious about Bubblegum.

04:29.587 --> 04:33.249
Look, I wrote her name all
over my arms and legs!

04:33.322 --> 04:35.347
Yuck!

04:35.423 --> 04:36.685
Guys?

04:36.756 --> 04:37.756
It's not fair!

04:37.790 --> 04:39.621
She always hangs out with you.

04:39.691 --> 04:42.285
<i>And it's not like you
want to marry her.</i>

04:42.359 --> 04:44.691
Why are you following us?!

04:44.760 --> 04:45.954
Whoa!

04:46.027 --> 04:47.255
I told you already!

04:47.328 --> 04:50.855
I want your blessing so I can
marry Princess Bubblegum!

04:58.733 --> 04:59.826
Come on, you guys.

04:59.901 --> 05:01.732
Give me permission to marry her.

05:01.802 --> 05:04.531
I'll... I'll... I'll do
a little dance for you.

05:06.104 --> 05:08.469
Hmm? You like this?

05:08.538 --> 05:09.369
No!

05:09.439 --> 05:10.906
Oh. Come on!

05:10.973 --> 05:14.271
If you bless our wedding, then
maybe she'll really love me.

05:14.341 --> 05:16.104
Ice King, go away, man!

05:16.175 --> 05:17.336
I will!

05:17.409 --> 05:18.933
When you bless our wedding!

05:19.010 --> 05:20.807
No, thanks, guy! Hmm?

05:20.878 --> 05:22.209
How does this gauntlet work?!

05:23.179 --> 05:24.237
Whoa!

05:27.780 --> 05:29.645
I can't turn it off!

05:29.715 --> 05:31.307
Punch it in the eye!

05:33.216 --> 05:34.343
Whew!

05:34.417 --> 05:36.009
Let's blow this stand!

05:38.253 --> 05:40.550
I tried to do this right,

05:40.620 --> 05:46.318
but you've driven me to this,
driven me to bad doing.

05:46.389 --> 05:49.586
Oh, Finn and Jake,
please be okay.

05:49.658 --> 05:50.716
Please be okay.

05:50.791 --> 05:52.452
Please be okay.

05:53.792 --> 05:55.192
Stupid thing.

05:55.261 --> 05:58.058
Come on!

05:58.128 --> 05:59.425
Ice King!

05:59.495 --> 06:00.827
Get out of here!

06:00.897 --> 06:02.762
<i>I didn't want to do this,</i>

06:02.831 --> 06:04.628
but by not blessing our wedding,

06:04.698 --> 06:09.497
Finn and Jake have
forced me to kidnap you.

06:09.567 --> 06:10.966
That's insane!

06:11.034 --> 06:12.593
I know!

06:12.668 --> 06:14.034
But I'll show them.

06:14.103 --> 06:16.094
I'll show them how
they've hurt us!

06:16.171 --> 06:17.399
No-o-o-o!

06:20.305 --> 06:21.136
There!

06:21.206 --> 06:22.571
Out over the lake!

06:25.742 --> 06:26.742
After his butt!

06:26.808 --> 06:28.435
I'm your dinghy dog!

06:32.444 --> 06:34.309
Here! I'll help paddle!

06:34.379 --> 06:37.347
Hey. It's me.

06:37.413 --> 06:38.244
Aw, come on!

06:38.314 --> 06:41.282
I'm sorry I punched
you in the ball.

06:44.250 --> 06:45.080
Waah!

06:45.150 --> 06:47.118
Yeah!

06:49.252 --> 06:53.915
Closing in... gonna
get you, man!

06:53.988 --> 06:55.182
Closer, Jake!

06:55.255 --> 06:56.654
Closer...

06:56.722 --> 06:58.280
Clo-o-o-o-ser...

06:58.356 --> 06:59.415
Ah!

06:59.491 --> 07:00.958
Princess? No!

07:02.659 --> 07:04.923
Oh, no.

07:04.993 --> 07:06.927
Oh, gross.

07:06.994 --> 07:08.723
This water stinks.

07:08.795 --> 07:09.625
Aw!

07:09.695 --> 07:10.526
Ice King!

07:10.596 --> 07:11.893
Look!

07:11.963 --> 07:14.056
Look what you made me do to her!

07:14.131 --> 07:15.462
Guys!

07:15.531 --> 07:18.295
Don't let the Lich reach
his well of power!

07:21.901 --> 07:24.233
Oh, no! He's made it!

07:24.303 --> 07:25.600
Don't worry, Princess!

07:28.571 --> 07:30.562
Hey, where you guys goin'?

07:30.638 --> 07:31.662
What's going on?

07:41.877 --> 07:43.777
I don't have time for this!

07:43.844 --> 07:44.971
Then let's go!

07:47.913 --> 07:48.744
My pack!

07:48.814 --> 07:50.873
It's okay!

07:50.949 --> 07:52.507
Whoa!

07:53.349 --> 07:54.715
Waah!

07:56.017 --> 07:57.279
Man.

07:57.351 --> 08:00.479
I-I want to go after them,
but that hole looks scary,

08:00.553 --> 08:02.145
doesn't it?

08:02.221 --> 08:04.018
Well, holes are holes!

08:11.124 --> 08:12.284
The Lich!

08:16.560 --> 08:18.357
He's gettin' his powers back.

08:18.428 --> 08:19.428
Weird.

08:19.495 --> 08:20.894
No!

08:20.963 --> 08:22.794
Prepare thyself...

08:22.863 --> 08:26.059
to get smote in the
name of Bubblegum...

08:27.932 --> 08:29.832
Shh.

08:34.402 --> 08:35.232
Yep.

08:35.302 --> 08:36.462
Holes are holes.

08:36.537 --> 08:38.232
Yaah!

08:38.304 --> 08:39.498
Look out!

08:39.571 --> 08:41.869
That's it! I'm gonna bark him!

08:45.007 --> 08:45.838
Whoa!

08:45.908 --> 08:49.968
Aah!

08:50.043 --> 08:50.873
Finn.

08:50.943 --> 08:52.570
Oh, no!

08:52.644 --> 08:54.737
Finn...

08:54.812 --> 08:58.042
Come.

09:00.047 --> 09:00.912
Stop!

09:00.982 --> 09:05.213
Aren't you cold, Finn?

09:05.284 --> 09:09.981
Walk into the well, Finn.

09:10.052 --> 09:12.282
Aren't you cold?

09:15.788 --> 09:17.551
No, I'm not!

09:17.623 --> 09:19.989
I've got a sweater on!

09:20.057 --> 09:22.150
You are a joke to me!

09:28.794 --> 09:30.091
This sweater.

09:30.161 --> 09:31.857
It's keeping me safe.

09:31.929 --> 09:34.022
I care about you, Finn.

09:34.097 --> 09:35.429
This is it...

09:35.498 --> 09:37.761
the ultimate weapon
against evil.

09:37.832 --> 09:40.824
The power of I-I... luh...

09:40.900 --> 09:42.800
I-liking someone a lot.

09:45.402 --> 09:47.131
Lich!

10:09.247 --> 10:11.215
Ugh!

10:11.282 --> 10:13.943
Finn! Buddy!

10:14.016 --> 10:15.677
Guh...

10:15.750 --> 10:17.775
Jake?

10:17.851 --> 10:18.682
Jake!

10:18.752 --> 10:20.481
Oh, Finn!

10:20.552 --> 10:21.484
You did it!

10:21.552 --> 10:23.077
We did?

10:23.153 --> 10:24.746
Hey! Yeah! We did it!

10:24.821 --> 10:25.879
Oh, you guys!

10:25.955 --> 10:30.118
This experience has brought us
all so much closer together.

10:30.190 --> 10:32.783
Princess, I'm sorry
for all of this.

10:32.858 --> 10:36.021
I love you, and I've
decided to set you free!

10:37.093 --> 10:38.152
Go free-e-e-e!

10:41.396 --> 10:42.226
Uh...

10:42.296 --> 10:43.127
Whoops!

10:43.196 --> 10:45.027
I've got the dropsies!
