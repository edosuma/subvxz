WEBVTT

00:18.080 --> 00:20.708
All right, Dad, I'm ready.
Throw it to me, now!

00:20.710 --> 00:22.496
Franklin Public Park
DES PLAINES, ILLINOIS

00:22.500 --> 00:25.162
Okay, now, pull it in and run it back.
Let's go! Come on!

00:25.170 --> 00:26.535
I got you.

00:31.420 --> 00:33.615
On SWAT we broke shots
down into three steps.

00:33.620 --> 00:34.826
Firearms Training Facility
QUANTICO, VIRGINIA

00:34.830 --> 00:37.037
front sight, focus on
the front sight, not on the target.

00:37.040 --> 00:38.450
controlled trigger press.

00:38.460 --> 00:41.202
follow through, after the shot
you come right back to the target.

00:41.210 --> 00:43.246
-Now, what did you do wrong?
-I didn't follow through.

00:43.250 --> 00:45.206
Right. You came off the target
to see where you hit.

00:45.210 --> 00:47.417
Hotch, my firearms qualification
is tomorrow morning.

00:47.420 --> 00:49.706
I barely passed my last one.

00:51.540 --> 00:54.919
Front sight, trigger press,

00:56.380 --> 00:57.665
follow through.

00:58.120 --> 01:01.112
You do those three things,
you'll hit your target every time.

01:14.420 --> 01:15.785
Yeah!

01:20.460 --> 01:22.451
I'm not falling for it.

01:30.920 --> 01:32.456
Come on, Pop.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.536
Stop playing.

01:47.000 --> 01:51.073
Oh, my God! Dad! Dad! Oh!

02:01.500 --> 02:04.572
-Did Elle teach you that?
-They're going to take away my gun.

02:04.580 --> 02:08.789
-Profilers aren't required to carry.
-Yeah, and yet you carry two of them.

02:26.290 --> 02:28.246
When I joined the BAU,
Gideon said to me,

02:28.250 --> 02:30.457
"You don't have to carry a gun
to kill someone."

02:30.460 --> 02:32.246
-I don't get it.
-You will.

02:32.250 --> 02:33.956
Good luck tomorrow.

02:52.380 --> 02:56.328
F.B.I., Behavioral Analysis Unit
QUANTICO, VIRGINIA

03:02.210 --> 03:03.780
Reid failed his qualification.

03:03.790 --> 03:05.326
Well, he can re-test in two weeks.

03:05.330 --> 03:07.036
Yeah, but he's going
to be embarrassed about it,

03:07.040 --> 03:08.996
so let's not mention it.

03:09.000 --> 03:13.073
-Yeah, let's not, huh?
-Not a word.

03:21.580 --> 03:22.740
Hey.

03:24.040 --> 03:27.453
We're all here for you. I'm serious.

03:28.790 --> 03:30.701
If you ever need anything...

03:34.170 --> 03:35.785
Just blow on that.

03:38.120 --> 03:40.111
Hey. Franklin Park, Des Plaines.

03:40.120 --> 03:42.532
Yesterday afternoon.
Three victims shot at distance.

03:42.540 --> 03:45.077
It's the third such shooting
in two weeks.

03:45.670 --> 03:47.991
We don't use that word.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.160
Why not?

03:49.170 --> 03:50.990
The public perception is that the FBI

03:51.000 --> 03:53.377
doesn't have an exemplary record
with snipers.

03:53.380 --> 03:57.032
Besides, a sniper is a professional
marksman. These guys aren't snipers.

03:57.040 --> 03:59.326
-What do we call them, then?
-L.D.S.K.

03:59.330 --> 04:01.707
Long distance serial killers.

04:02.420 --> 04:05.071
How many of these guys
have we caught using a profile?

04:05.080 --> 04:06.377
None.

04:43.540 --> 04:46.828
Two weeks. Three shooting incidents.
Six victims. All shot in the abdomen.

04:46.830 --> 04:47.990
First and only fatality,

04:48.000 --> 04:51.822
Henry Sachs, married, father of three,
shot in a shopping center parking lot.

04:51.830 --> 04:54.492
Nine days later,
Doug Miller and Kevin Parks

04:54.500 --> 04:57.992
were playing basketball
at a community center.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.377
Franklin Park.
Four days later, Jerry Middleton,

05:00.380 --> 05:02.166
Kate Murray and Tim Reilly.

05:02.170 --> 05:05.207
The Des Plaines Police have found
no link between any of the victims.

05:05.210 --> 05:07.280
_-Bal|istic_s?
-He's usmg frangible rounds

05:07.290 --> 05:10.032
which fragment on impact, making
ballistics comparisons impossible.

05:10.040 --> 05:12.531
The good news is that all the park
victims are going to make it.

05:12.540 --> 05:14.952
The bad news is
that none of them saw anything.

05:14.960 --> 05:18.373
However, one of the patients does have
an intact bullet lodged in his spine.

05:18.380 --> 05:19.529
Well, what's the prognosis?

05:19.540 --> 05:21.417
Well, there's disagreement
among surgical staff

05:21.420 --> 05:24.821
as to whether they can remove
the slug without paralyzing the patient.

05:24.830 --> 05:28.743
Well, without a useful witness
or solid piece of forensic evidence...

05:28.750 --> 05:31.116
The profile is all we'll have.

05:36.540 --> 05:37.825
Nietzsche wrote,

05:37.830 --> 05:40.708
"The irrationality of a thing
is not an argument

05:40.710 --> 05:44.578
"against its existence,
rather, a condition of it."

05:45.460 --> 05:48.452
L.D.S.K.s are so rare we haven't been
able to build a standard profile.

05:48.460 --> 05:50.280
they're always male,

05:50.290 --> 05:53.111
they frequently have law enforcement
or military experience,

05:53.120 --> 05:55.372
and they always contact the police
or the media.

05:55.380 --> 05:57.780
To take credit or relive the experience?

05:57.790 --> 06:03.035
Both. All serial killers attempt to relive
the ecstasy they get from their killings.

06:03.040 --> 06:05.873
Some use souvenirs
taken from the Victims,

06:05.880 --> 06:10.658
and others return to the dump site
to interact with the body.

06:10.960 --> 06:12.951
Both modes require contact
with the victim.

06:12.960 --> 06:16.578
Contact which, by definition,
long distance serial killers don't have.

06:16.580 --> 06:19.242
The Beltway Shooters left a tarot card
at one of their crime scenes.

06:19.250 --> 06:22.071
Later they called a tip hotline
which ultimately led to their capture.

06:22.080 --> 06:24.457
But our UnSub
hasn't contacted anybody.

06:24.460 --> 06:25.916
He will.

06:25.920 --> 06:27.990
Until he does, what do we have?

06:28.000 --> 06:30.491
Sometimes it's not what the l_JnSub
does that reveals the profile.

06:30.500 --> 06:32.741
Sometimes it is what they do not do.

06:33.290 --> 06:35.201
He doesn't kill his victims.

06:35.210 --> 06:36.916
"Underkill" is a unique signature.

06:36.920 --> 06:39.241
Question is, does he shoot them
in the stomach intentionally,

06:39.250 --> 06:40.410
just to wound them?

06:40.420 --> 06:43.537
Or is he just aiming
at the biggest part of the target?

06:44.790 --> 06:48.669
Specifically, does the UnSub lack
the skill to make the head shot,

06:48.670 --> 06:50.661
or simply the will to take it?

07:03.080 --> 07:04.456
Agent Hotchner?

07:04.460 --> 07:07.782
Detective Calvin,
this is Agent Morgan, Agent Reid.

07:07.790 --> 07:10.076
Thanks for coming. Follow me.

07:10.880 --> 07:14.452
The cones mark the places
where the victims were.

07:14.460 --> 07:17.702
So we know he fired
from somewhere in this area.

07:20.080 --> 07:24.824
Close enough to hit all three victims,
but far enough away not to be seen.

07:24.830 --> 07:26.411
If he's wounding
his victims intentionally,

07:26.420 --> 07:29.537
we would classify him
as a "sadistic killer."

07:30.000 --> 07:33.663
-That would help us?
-Well, we know a lot about sadists.

07:33.670 --> 07:36.161
But most want to be close
to their victims to watch them suffer.

07:36.170 --> 07:39.162
A powerful scope would allow
him to observe it from a safe distance.

07:39.170 --> 07:41.661
Well, how do we determine
if he's a sadist?

07:41.670 --> 07:45.413
We spend some time in his shoes,
and we let him tell us.

07:51.670 --> 07:53.490
Come on, Barry, you don't know that!

07:53.500 --> 07:55.206
Good morning, doctors.

07:58.080 --> 08:00.992
This is Dr. Neil Erstadt,
Chief of Surgery,

08:01.000 --> 08:03.878
and our trauma specialist,
Dr. Barry Landman.

08:03.880 --> 08:07.873
These are the FBI profilers,
Agents Gideon, Jareau, Greenaway.

08:08.210 --> 08:09.950
-How do you do

08:09.960 --> 08:13.327
You'll forgive me. I don't shake.
My hands, you understand?

08:14.290 --> 08:15.496
Of course.

08:15.500 --> 08:18.412
So as psychological profilers,
what exactly are you looking for?

08:18.420 --> 08:20.411
How the victims were shot.

08:20.420 --> 08:22.741
That could reveal
the shooter's signature behavior.

08:22.750 --> 08:26.379
These separate wound channels
"blossom" from the entrance wounds.

08:26.380 --> 08:28.280
You can see the trauma is extensive.

08:28.290 --> 08:30.702
-You performed the surgeries?
-On patient Miller.

08:30.710 --> 08:33.326
I consulted with Dr. Landman
on the others.

08:33.330 --> 08:36.822
The intact slug lodged
between the L4-L5 vertebrae.

08:36.830 --> 08:39.412
Any attempt to remove it would likely
leave the patient paralyzed.

08:39.420 --> 08:41.240
In your opinion.

08:41.250 --> 08:44.071
-In my opinion.
-Disagree?

08:44.080 --> 08:45.456
With the right surgeon, there is no risk.

08:45.460 --> 08:46.825
There's always risk.

08:46.830 --> 08:50.163
What significance does the bullet have
in building the profile?

08:50.170 --> 08:51.819
Well, even if we can't get
a ballistics match,

08:51.830 --> 08:53.786
we can get a rifle type,

08:54.500 --> 08:56.536
and the specific type of rifle
the suspect uses.

08:56.540 --> 08:58.451
That could be very significant
to the profile.

08:58.460 --> 09:01.372
You believe you can safely perform
the surgery, Dr. Landman?

09:01.380 --> 09:02.916
I know I can.

09:08.210 --> 09:10.110
This handicapped spot
couldn't be further away

09:10.120 --> 09:12.281
from the entrance to the building.

09:12.830 --> 09:14.070
Yeah?

09:14.080 --> 09:17.709
It also has line of sight to
all three victims and the flagpole.

09:18.880 --> 09:20.416
What are you thinking?

09:20.420 --> 09:22.206
At this range,
the UnSub would have to factor in

09:22.210 --> 09:25.168
wind direction and speed as he shot.

09:25.170 --> 09:28.412
To do this, he needed a spot
with a wide field of fire,

09:28.420 --> 09:30.240
where he could see the flag to judge

09:30.250 --> 09:32.491
how the wind would affect each shot.

09:33.750 --> 09:37.709
He came here before the shooting,
decided this was his spot,

09:39.040 --> 09:42.112
and ensured that it would be empty
when he came back.

09:46.290 --> 09:48.747
My guess is he's shooting from his car.

09:48.750 --> 09:51.116
Well, that would mean he wanted
to get away from here quickly,

09:51.120 --> 09:53.372
that he didn't stick around
to watch his victims suffer.

09:53.380 --> 09:55.416
So he would not be a sadist.

09:55.420 --> 09:56.660
What would he be?

09:56.670 --> 10:00.822
A very smart, very resourceful,
very paranoid sociopath.

10:02.580 --> 10:07.529
55 and 3:15?

10:07.540 --> 10:09.826
That's when I'd do it.
There are fewer cops on the street.

10:09.830 --> 10:12.412
-Why's that?
-Well, the police overlap shifts,

10:12.420 --> 10:14.820
so there's always someone
minding the store.

10:14.830 --> 10:17.572
00,
first shift walks at 3:30.

10:17.580 --> 10:20.117
Wouldn't there be twice as many cops
on the street at that time?

10:20.120 --> 10:21.280
In theory.

10:21.290 --> 10:23.201
First half-hour of your shift,
you're in roll call,

10:23.210 --> 10:24.575
you're not on the street.

10:24.580 --> 10:26.377
And the last half-hour,
you're at the station,

10:26.380 --> 10:27.995
you're finishing reports,
you're booking prisoners.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.457
So the 25 minutes
around the first/second shift,

10:30.460 --> 10:32.246
that's a bad guy's golden window.

10:32.250 --> 10:35.959
How many people outside
law enforcement would know that?

10:37.620 --> 10:41.249
But the UnSub does,
and you've already thought of this.

10:41.250 --> 10:42.740
I had considered it.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.706
Hope you find it useful.

10:51.420 --> 10:54.207
Dr. Landman

10:54.210 --> 10:57.748
The patient will make a full recovery.
As I told you he would.

11:02.250 --> 11:06.072
Radiology is set up to take photos
and e-mail them out for consults.

11:06.500 --> 11:08.991
Ca|| Hotch.
We're getting the bullet to Garcia.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.410
Fill him in on the shift-change theory.

11:11.540 --> 11:12.825
One second.

11:14.670 --> 11:15.910
Yeah, Morgan.

11:15.920 --> 11:18.707
-Isn't this spooky

11:18.710 --> 11:20.530
That right now,
you were thinking about me,

11:20.540 --> 11:24.249
and out of the blue, your phone rings.
And it's me. Huh?

11:24.250 --> 11:26.707
How's that for a spiritual connection?

11:26.710 --> 11:27.950
Do I know you?

11:27.960 --> 11:29.496
Why do you hurt me?

11:30.380 --> 11:33.577
Garcia, please tell me you've nailed
down a geographic profile on our guy.

11:33.580 --> 11:34.786
Okay, I'll give you the good news first,

11:34.790 --> 11:37.452
which is not that good,
but it's better than the bad.

11:37.460 --> 11:39.200
We think the shooter
has intimate knowledge

11:39.210 --> 11:40.950
of law enforcement procedures.

11:40.960 --> 11:43.201
Detective Calvin,
how far out of your jurisdiction

11:43.210 --> 11:46.077
-is crime scene number two

11:46.080 --> 11:48.287
If he knew how difficult it is
for local police departments

11:48.290 --> 11:49.826
to interact with each other,

11:49.830 --> 11:53.379
he may have intentionally
crossed jurisdiction lines.

11:55.790 --> 11:57.326
Y'all are saying the shooter is a cop.

11:57.330 --> 11:58.706
We're saying it's a possibility.

11:58.710 --> 12:00.530
He scouted and prepped
each crime scene.

12:00.540 --> 12:02.781
He chose an elevated position
with excellent enfilade,

12:02.790 --> 12:04.246
and perfect field of fire.

12:04.250 --> 12:05.990
-That's textbook military practice.
-True.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.036
Yeah, but maybe he was in the Army.

12:08.040 --> 12:11.248
He was probably a Marine, Ranger
or other specialized unit.

12:11.250 --> 12:15.289
Garcia says the bullet was a .223 fired
from an M4 variant of the M16.

12:15.290 --> 12:17.030
All the services use an M4.

12:17.040 --> 12:18.871
It's got a shorter barrel than the M16.

12:18.880 --> 12:20.780
It's less accurate,
and it's a lot harder to fire,

12:20.790 --> 12:22.075
especially at these distances.

12:22.080 --> 12:24.412
This level _of skill indicates
speCIalized training.

12:24.420 --> 12:27.912
If he has specialized training,
he knows exactly what he's doing.

12:27.920 --> 12:30.536
-He intended to wound them.
-The "underkill" is deliberate.

12:30.540 --> 12:31.746
Everything he does is deliberate,

12:31.750 --> 12:34.071
but it's as if he needs to show us
how smart he is.

12:34.080 --> 12:36.742
Well, since the crime scenes aren't
centered around one single location,

12:36.750 --> 12:39.662
Garcia can't get a geographic profile
without additional data.

12:39.670 --> 12:42.321
-What kind of data?
-More crime scenes.

12:42.330 --> 12:45.822
She's going to get them.
This guy's got something to prove.

12:52.080 --> 12:54.412
-How did it play out?
-He's been suspended.

12:54.420 --> 12:57.071
But my guess is that the school board
is gonna go after him,

12:57.080 --> 13:00.072
and they're gonna try to expel him.

13:04.500 --> 13:06.536
I don't feel very good.

13:07.380 --> 13:09.109
I'm gonna go to the ladies' room, okay?

13:09.120 --> 13:10.280
Okay.

13:13.170 --> 13:15.821
Honey, you have something
on your dress.

13:19.960 --> 13:21.996
Hey! What was that?

13:33.750 --> 13:36.708
Three more victims
with non-fatal wounds

13:36.710 --> 13:39.998
and it's only been 48 hours
since the last shooting.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.070
Media attention and the FBI presence

13:42.080 --> 13:45.072
will only escalate his desire
to shoot again.

13:45.080 --> 13:48.959
-Meaning?
-This is going to get much worse.

13:48.960 --> 13:50.951
Then we need to give the police
a profile immediately.

13:50.960 --> 13:53.167
-You ready?
-State troopers.

13:53.170 --> 13:55.877
This is the second time
he's crossed jurisdictions.

13:55.880 --> 13:58.952
Yeah, we're ready.
They're not gonna like it.

13:59.880 --> 14:03.782
This initial profile is not ready
to be given to the media.

14:03.790 --> 14:07.783
Releasing this profile prematurely
can get people killed.

14:12.420 --> 14:14.786
We're looking for a 30
to 40-year-old male veteran

14:14.790 --> 14:16.872
driving a car large enough
to shoot from,

14:16.880 --> 14:18.871
but not so large it was noticed.

14:18.880 --> 14:21.030
Like the Beltway Shooter,
it's probably a sedan,

14:21.040 --> 14:24.703
customized to conceal the shooter,
his weapon and the sound of his shot.

14:27.620 --> 14:29.668
The UnSub suffers
from both narcissistic

14:29.670 --> 14:31.877
and paranoid personality disorders.

14:31.880 --> 14:34.496
He works out obsessively
and is never without a weapon.

14:34.500 --> 14:37.537
He's completely self-centered
and cannot empathize with others.

14:37.540 --> 14:41.533
Incapable of admitting fault, he blames
his shortcomings on those around him.

14:41.540 --> 14:43.417
He has no friends
and his career history

14:43.420 --> 14:45.820
has been marked
by frequent job changes.

14:45.830 --> 14:49.493
He's drawn to high-stakes jobs
by a need to prove his superiority

14:49.500 --> 14:52.537
to a world he perceives
has undervalued him.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.458
And these shootings are
the ultimate expression of that need.

14:57.080 --> 15:00.072
We believe he changes
jurisdictions intentionally,

15:00.080 --> 15:02.287
and strikes during
the first/second shift change,

15:02.290 --> 15:04.667
indicating an intimate knowledge
of law enforcement.

15:04.670 --> 15:06.206
You're saying he's one of us?

15:06.210 --> 15:09.873
We're saying he once was,
or is now, a police officer.

15:09.880 --> 15:13.828
-Is he driving a white van, too?
-Enough.

15:14.960 --> 15:16.996
That'll be all for now.

15:17.500 --> 15:19.616
We can talk in my office.

15:22.290 --> 15:23.700
Thank you.

15:26.330 --> 15:29.288
Sergeant Weigart, we would like
to re-enact the third shooting

15:29.290 --> 15:30.951
-during the shift change.
-Why?

15:30.960 --> 15:33.201
Well, to better understand his MO.

15:33.210 --> 15:34.575
How does he get there,
how does he leave,

15:34.580 --> 15:35.740
what's the traffic like.

15:35.750 --> 15:37.115
It could help us with witnesses.

15:37.120 --> 15:40.112
Maybe the victims or bystanders
saw something but don't realize

15:40.120 --> 15:42.702
the significance of what they saw.

15:43.380 --> 15:45.496
All right. Let's do it.

15:49.880 --> 15:51.108
How are you holding up?

15:51.120 --> 15:55.159
Look at me, without a gun on my belt,
I look like a teacher's assistant.

15:55.580 --> 15:57.411
You're not worried about how you look.

15:57.420 --> 15:59.615
Hotch told me that
when he came to the BAU,

15:59.620 --> 16:01.747
you told him he didn't need
a gun to kill somebody.

16:01.750 --> 16:03.456
Well, the only truly
effective weapon we have

16:03.460 --> 16:06.031
is our ability to do
the one thing they can't.

16:06.040 --> 16:08.076
-Which is what?
-Empathize.

16:08.670 --> 16:11.707
They dehumanize their victims.
We humanize the killers.

16:11.710 --> 16:14.281
You're just saying that to convince me
I don't need to carry a gun.

16:14.290 --> 16:17.032
I don't care you carry a gun or not.

16:17.040 --> 16:19.873
Deadliest weapon we have
is a thorough and accurate profile.

16:19.880 --> 16:21.245
Of course you believe that.

16:21.250 --> 16:23.616
Footpath Killer, he had a shotgun
to the back of my head.

16:23.620 --> 16:25.372
I'm here, he's not.

16:32.420 --> 16:34.069
Elle, Jerry Middleton was facing

16:34.080 --> 16:35.377
a little further south.

16:35.380 --> 16:36.950
Can you give us that?

16:37.540 --> 16:40.998
How's that?
-Perfect. Hold your camera right there.

16:45.080 --> 16:47.162
It doesn't look like
Jerry Middleton had a clear view

16:47.170 --> 16:49.491
of the sniper's vehicle
when he was shot.

16:49.500 --> 16:51.661
The tree branches are in the way.

16:57.120 --> 16:59.953
I do have a clear view
of the vehicle from here.

16:59.960 --> 17:03.418
Tim Reilly would have seen it
if he'd looked down from the kite.

17:03.420 --> 17:06.787
Good, have the UnSub
pop the trunk, see if Reid can see it.

17:09.170 --> 17:11.320
No, sorry. I can't.

17:11.330 --> 17:13.070
Nothing from position one.

17:13.080 --> 17:15.492
Okay, everybody,
move to position two.

17:16.710 --> 17:18.871
And now, we go to John Jenkins,

17:18.880 --> 17:20.165
reporting live from Franklin Park,

17:20.170 --> 17:23.287
with breaking news
on the sniper investigation.

17:23.290 --> 17:24.416
Through anonymous sources...

17:24.420 --> 17:25.569
You gotta see this.

17:25.580 --> 17:26.990
...we have learnt that
the FBI profilers have told

17:27.000 --> 17:29.537
the police task force that the sniper
is in fact

17:29.540 --> 17:32.577
a member of
the Des Plaines Police Department.

17:32.580 --> 17:33.911
Who could have leaked this?

17:33.920 --> 17:35.876
The only people who had
the profile were your people,

17:35.880 --> 17:37.950
and the profile implicates them.

17:37.960 --> 17:40.167
Why would a cop
leak sensitive information

17:40.170 --> 17:42.115
that would not only implicate
one of his own,

17:42.120 --> 17:44.611
but make every citizen in the county
afraid to get pulled over?

17:44.620 --> 17:46.781
Well, what does he get out of it?

17:47.460 --> 17:49.246
Contact with the media.

17:49.580 --> 17:50.615
What?

17:51.000 --> 17:52.786
The cop who leaked this story
is a good suspect.

17:52.790 --> 17:56.783
Contacting the media could have been
his sick way of keeping this alive.

17:59.710 --> 18:01.371
Vic, why don't you go ahead
and call the station

18:01.380 --> 18:03.780
and find out what they've got in mind
for one of the later shows...

18:03.790 --> 18:05.997
Mr. Jenkins, I'm Special Agent
Jennifer Jareau with the FBI.

18:06.000 --> 18:10.039
-We need you to identify your source.
-No way, I know my rights.

18:10.040 --> 18:12.372
Hey, hey! Shoot the... Vic, shoot this!
Get this all on tape.

18:12.380 --> 18:13.574
You got cuffs?

18:13.580 --> 18:16.322
You should know the FBI considers
these shootings an act of terrorism.

18:16.330 --> 18:20.073
Under the Patriot Act we can
detain you as long as we need to.

18:20.080 --> 18:22.742
All I know is his cell number.

18:25.420 --> 18:26.489
We have a lead.

18:27.170 --> 18:28.956
Rainmaker. How wet do you want it?

18:28.960 --> 18:31.997
It's Hotch. I have a cell phone number,
and I need the name on the account.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.662
If you call the cell I can throw in
the real time location, no charge.

18:34.670 --> 18:36.820
-Are you ready?-I was born ready.

18:44.210 --> 18:46.701
Shouldn't you pull your people
out of the park?

18:46.710 --> 18:50.328
If we do, and the shooter is here,
he'll sense something is wrong.

18:50.330 --> 18:52.116
He could start shooting.

18:52.120 --> 18:56.079
That cell is part of a batch purchased
by the Des Plaines Police Department.

18:56.080 --> 18:57.377
I need a name, Garcia.

18:57.380 --> 18:59.917
It's gonna take a second.
I have to pull it from their system.

18:59.920 --> 19:01.706
Then give me the location.

19:04.960 --> 19:06.609
Franklin Park, Des Plaines.

19:06.620 --> 19:07.826
He's here.

19:12.080 --> 19:13.490
The name, Garcia.

19:14.420 --> 19:16.820
-McCarty, Scott.
-Scott McCarty.

19:20.120 --> 19:22.953
-McCarty is the UnSub.
-Yeah, where is he?

19:22.960 --> 19:25.997
McCarty is playing the UnSub.

19:56.790 --> 20:00.248
-We need to talk to Scott McCarty.
-He's the leak.

20:00.920 --> 20:03.377
McCarty. Why am I not surprised?

20:03.380 --> 20:05.325
I need SWAT in the lot ASAP.

20:05.330 --> 20:07.161
Copy that.

20:07.170 --> 20:08.660
We didn't say he was the shooter.

20:08.670 --> 20:12.492
You could just call him on the radio
and tell him to come to us.

20:12.500 --> 20:14.411
Best case, he leaked the story.

20:14.420 --> 20:17.036
Worst case, I'm not about to let him
take down any of my men.

20:17.040 --> 20:19.668
We come heaw
and we take him clean.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.161
This is McCarty, what's going on?

21:09.080 --> 21:10.991
-Reid! Reid, get down.
-What?

21:16.420 --> 21:20.868
Toss your rifle and your side arm out
of the vehicle and show us your hands!

21:20.880 --> 21:23.451
-I don't understand.
-We know what you did, Scotty.

21:23.460 --> 21:26.167
-Look, I can explain.
-Don't make me give the order!

21:26.170 --> 21:28.616
Okay, all right, all right!

21:31.290 --> 21:34.498
Now open the trunk lid slowly.

21:40.960 --> 21:43.781
Come on. That's it.

21:46.290 --> 21:47.871
Everything is secure.

21:48.290 --> 21:49.450
Put your hands up.

21:51.750 --> 21:53.490
-Got it_.
-Yes, Sir.

21:53.790 --> 21:55.746
Okay, get him up, get him up.

22:03.670 --> 22:04.955
-Shot fired!
-Get down!

22:04.960 --> 22:06.325
Go!Gun!

22:06.330 --> 22:10.323
Shots fired! Shots fired!
Get down!

22:21.830 --> 22:24.788
How did McCarty end up playing
the UnSub?

22:25.380 --> 22:28.827
Weigart punished McCarty for
mouthing off during the profile briefing

22:28.830 --> 22:32.038
by making him the UnSub
and sticking him in the trunk

22:32.040 --> 22:33.371
of the car all afternoon.

22:33.380 --> 22:36.417
Wait, then how did the UnSub find out
about the re-enactment?

22:36.420 --> 22:39.912
Look, come on, cops talk.
Pissed-off cops talk loud.

22:39.920 --> 22:42.536
At home, at the bars, at gyms,
and to anyone who'll listen.

22:42.540 --> 22:44.030
What do we know?

22:44.040 --> 22:48.784
Our UnSub went from wounding
civilians to executing a police officer.

22:49.580 --> 22:52.162
So, he's escalated.

22:52.620 --> 22:54.451
He's not staying on script.

22:54.460 --> 22:56.746
Sometimes it's what they don't do.

22:56.750 --> 22:59.071
He did not pick McCarty at random.

22:59.540 --> 23:02.111
Why?

23:05.250 --> 23:06.615
Wants to send a message.

23:06.620 --> 23:08.827
"Nobody takes credit for my work."

23:08.830 --> 23:11.492
Yes, sir, his ego won't allow it.
He feels underappreciated.

23:12.670 --> 23:14.114
Okay. But we still don't know
why he wounds them.

23:14.120 --> 23:15.280
Excuse me.

23:15.290 --> 23:17.702
We know if a killer has no contact
with his victims,

23:17.710 --> 23:19.575
he will contact the media.

23:19.580 --> 23:21.662
But he hasn't contacted the media.

23:21.670 --> 23:25.492
-He has contact with his victims.
-And there's only one way.

23:25.500 --> 23:27.070
All right, thanks.

23:27.080 --> 23:29.457
Garcia nailed down
the geographic profile.

23:29.460 --> 23:31.781
The crime scenes are centered
on two separate locations.

23:31.790 --> 23:33.371
The hospitals.

23:40.250 --> 23:43.071
-I believe it's a case of "hero homicide."
-What's that?

23:43.080 --> 23:45.913
The best-known case
was hospital nurse Richard Angelo.

23:45.920 --> 23:48.912
He would inject toxins into his victims,
then wait for them to crash

23:48.920 --> 23:51.115
so that he could run to the rescue
and save them.

23:51.120 --> 23:53.953
He killed 25 people,
and that's just that we know of.

23:53.960 --> 23:56.702
If he attacked them to save them,
why did he kill 25 people?

23:56.710 --> 23:57.870
Wasn't very good at it.

23:57.880 --> 24:01.372
Yeah, and hospitals don't keep records
of people who "almost" died.

24:01.380 --> 24:03.325
So, what's the profile
of one of these guys?

24:03.330 --> 24:05.742
Arrogant. Conceited.

24:06.620 --> 24:08.997
Feel superior to everyone around them.

24:09.670 --> 24:12.571
You've just described
every surgeon I've ever met.

24:14.710 --> 24:17.372
You'll forgive me. I don't shake.
My hands, you understand?

24:17.380 --> 24:18.665
Of course.

24:21.670 --> 24:22.955
Landman.

24:25.960 --> 24:27.700
Let's start with Landman.

24:46.330 --> 24:50.209
Ca|| Weigart. Tell him we need
a discrete perimeter around this block.

24:50.210 --> 24:52.531
I'm gonna go check out Landman's car.

24:59.880 --> 25:01.996
Okay, courtesy of Garcia.

25:02.920 --> 25:05.992
Landman was Army.
Started out in MP school.

25:06.000 --> 25:07.786
Well, there's your law enforcement.

25:07.790 --> 25:09.246
He was smart.

25:09.250 --> 25:10.660
Got a degree on Uncle Sam

25:10.670 --> 25:12.956
and ended up a doctor
with Special Forces.

25:12.960 --> 25:17.499
And bounced around from hospital
to hospital since his discharge in 2001.

25:17.830 --> 25:21.118
Has Dr. Landman been under
any unusual strain?

25:22.040 --> 25:23.780
Has he had a reprimand?

25:24.120 --> 25:27.203
Has he had any kind
of major blow to his ego?

25:28.500 --> 25:31.913
Last month he was passed over
for Chief of Surgery.

25:32.540 --> 25:35.202
Let's get a warrant for his house.
Let's see if we find the weapon.

25:35.210 --> 25:36.370
Okay.

25:37.500 --> 25:39.286
What can I do to help?

25:43.460 --> 25:45.701
One-six—one, Nurse...

25:47.120 --> 25:49.873
-Where's Marst_on?
-She's not coming.

25:50.330 --> 25:51.570
Look, I'm very busy right now.

25:51.580 --> 25:53.411
Perhaps you could make
an appointment.

25:53.420 --> 25:56.571
-Busy with what?
-Things.

25:57.580 --> 25:59.070
What kind of things?

26:01.540 --> 26:03.701
Doctor to coronary care...

26:03.710 --> 26:05.826
Doctor to coronary care...

26:06.460 --> 26:10.419
-You're considering me a suspect?
-Yes.

26:11.040 --> 26:14.112
Well, that's disconcerting. I heard
what happened to your last suspect.

26:14.120 --> 26:17.419
-Do you want to know why

26:17.420 --> 26:19.490
Have you ever heard of
"hero homicide"?

26:19.500 --> 26:23.072
Would I be less suspicious
if I let my patients die?

26:23.080 --> 26:24.707
Absolutely.

26:24.710 --> 26:27.998
Imaging center,
pick up line 5115.

26:28.420 --> 26:29.819
You get anything from his car?

26:29.830 --> 26:32.788
-It's a red two-seat Maserati.
-Of course.

26:33.460 --> 26:35.280
If he's the shooter,
he has another vehicle.

26:35.290 --> 26:37.531
This type of killer seeks
the power over life and death.

26:37.540 --> 26:39.872
He covets the power of God.
Do you know anyone like that?

26:39.880 --> 26:41.825
I want you to understand something.

26:41.830 --> 26:43.616
When my patients
are in the operating room,

26:43.620 --> 26:47.078
they need God,
and that is exactly what I give them.

26:47.080 --> 26:49.241
When someone's holding
your beating heart in their hands,

26:49.250 --> 26:51.992
who do you want holding it Or God?

26:52.960 --> 26:56.452
00?
-I was in my office.

26:56.460 --> 26:57.825
Alone?

26:57.830 --> 27:01.038
I was in my office with Dr. Hannah Pate.

27:01.500 --> 27:04.207
I'm not the only one
who thinks I'm a god.

27:04.210 --> 27:08.453
She's in the ER right now.
Go on. Ask her.

27:11.880 --> 27:14.451
Reid, let's take a walk down to the ER.

27:16.710 --> 27:19.577
My guess is, Dr. Pate is going
to corroborate Landman's alibi.

27:19.580 --> 27:20.911
You don't think Landman's
the shooter?

27:20.920 --> 27:22.410
Richard Angelo wanted to be a hero

27:22.420 --> 27:23.990
because in his everyday life
he was nobody.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.036
Landman is a surgeon.
He has power and recognition.

27:26.040 --> 27:27.746
Yeah, but you know,
surgeons are a different breed.

27:27.750 --> 27:31.379
They're the stars in their field and
Landman is definitely not one of them.

27:31.380 --> 27:34.247
Gurneys needed
at the west entrance...

27:34.250 --> 27:37.617
Excuse me.
I'd like to speak with Dr. Pate.

27:37.920 --> 27:40.491
Yes, sir, I'll go find her for you.

27:40.960 --> 27:44.248
The motivations for "hero homicide"
are eXCItement, power and respect.

27:44.250 --> 27:46.957
And even though Landman's not a star,
he still gets respect.

27:46.960 --> 27:49.611
Racing against the clock to save
someone's life is exciting.

27:49.620 --> 27:51.531
Maybe it's not exciting enough, that's...

27:51.540 --> 27:53.201
That's why he shoots
three people at a time.

27:53.210 --> 27:54.495
But he can only operate on
one at a time.

27:54.500 --> 27:55.910
It wouldn't be any more exciting.

27:55.920 --> 27:59.572
Trauma team to ICU west...
Trauma team to ICU west.

28:05.710 --> 28:10.659
At least not for Landman.
And not in the OR.

28:12.120 --> 28:15.578
Policemen and ER personnel are on
the exact same 24-hour shift schedule.

28:15.580 --> 28:17.286
The UnSub wasn't shooting
at shift change

28:17.290 --> 28:18.996
because there are fewer cops
on the street.

28:19.000 --> 28:20.991
He works the second shift
in the emergency room!

28:21.000 --> 28:22.740
Contact with the victims.

28:27.120 --> 28:30.078
Sir, you can't use a cell phone
in the hospital.

28:35.120 --> 28:37.168
Excuse me for a minute, please.

28:39.750 --> 28:42.116
We're FBI agents, and we believe

28:42.120 --> 28:44.497
that one of your staff members
might be the sniper.

28:44.500 --> 28:46.912
Now the man that we're looking for
works second shift

28:46.920 --> 28:49.707
and he would have transferred
from Arlington in the past two weeks.

28:49.710 --> 28:52.110
We haven't_ hired
any new personnel in two months.

28:52.120 --> 28:54.327
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

28:59.120 --> 29:03.409
He has the worst narcissistic
personality disorder I've ever seen.

29:04.710 --> 29:06.780
But he's not our guy.

29:06.790 --> 29:10.999
Subunit 12, we're
with the hospital designated security.

29:11.000 --> 29:14.208
That's it, let's go ahead
and go in for the...

29:38.460 --> 29:40.951
-Look, I've got patients who need me...
-He's in his thirties.

29:40.960 --> 29:45.169
He's vain, rude, arrogant, he works out,
he shows up to work late,

29:45.170 --> 29:46.455
he blames others for his mistakes,

29:46.460 --> 29:48.075
doesn't take responsibility
for his behavior,

29:48.080 --> 29:49.661
all of his co-workers detest him...

29:49.670 --> 29:53.162
Oh, my God. It's Phillip Dowd.

29:53.460 --> 29:58.113
-He's... He picks up shifts at Arlington.
-Is he here today?

29:58.120 --> 30:00.031
-Oh, my God.
-Okay. ..

30:00.040 --> 30:02.031
Okay. Your patients need you calm.

30:02.040 --> 30:05.032
Tell me, is Dowd working today?

30:06.710 --> 30:09.372
Do you see him?

30:13.290 --> 30:15.167
Go te|| Gideon.

30:15.170 --> 30:16.910
Reid. Easy.

30:33.250 --> 30:36.162
Nobody moves, and nobody dies!

30:42.330 --> 30:44.321
Better be a head shot.

30:46.080 --> 30:50.574
I got this on full auto. Anything less,
I go down squeezing the trigger.

31:14.750 --> 31:17.992
You, take your partner's gun,
put it on the counter.

31:18.000 --> 31:19.285
He's not armed.

31:20.790 --> 31:22.200
See for yourself.

31:25.120 --> 31:26.667
Hands on your heads.

31:37.830 --> 31:39.320
Get up, Keith.

31:41.790 --> 31:43.280
Put those on them.

31:49.250 --> 31:50.990
Now put them on yourself.

31:51.420 --> 31:55.493
Now, step back. Back up.
Back up. Back up.

31:58.460 --> 32:00.451
Get down on the ground.

32:01.540 --> 32:02.871
Have a seat.

32:04.460 --> 32:07.668
Now what kind of an FBI agent
doesn't carry a gun?

32:07.670 --> 32:10.241
-I'm a profiler.
-Profiler?

32:10.920 --> 32:13.491
-They sent you to figure me out?
-We did.

32:13.500 --> 32:15.912
-That's how we found...
-Shut up, Reid.

32:16.420 --> 32:17.956
No, don't shut up.

32:18.210 --> 32:21.111
Tell me what you think
you know about me.

32:22.580 --> 32:25.663
Go ahead, genius. Tell him. Tell him.

32:26.460 --> 32:29.577
But remember,
get it wrong and he's going to kill you.

32:33.080 --> 32:37.244
Okay, you're the boss, you tell me.

32:37.580 --> 32:39.992
Who am I

32:40.330 --> 32:43.037
We know you shot 11 people
in broad daylight and left us nothing.

32:43.040 --> 32:45.827
You executed a cop in front of the FBI
and got away clean.

32:45.830 --> 32:49.573
And I know your plan is to go down in
a hail of bullets.

32:49.580 --> 32:50.820
What else do you know?

32:59.210 --> 33:01.952
He joined the Army at 18.
Went to Ranger school.

33:01.960 --> 33:04.076
Did six years before being
dishonorably discharged

33:04.080 --> 33:06.378
in '95 for conduct unbecoming.

33:06.380 --> 33:08.917
Obviously lied about it
and joined the Arlington PD.

33:08.920 --> 33:11.377
-You were right. He was a cop.
-For nine months.

33:11.380 --> 33:14.611
When they found out he lied about
the discharge, they kicked him out.

33:14.620 --> 33:17.953
Soon thereafter,
Dowd got his nursing license.

33:17.960 --> 33:21.111
He's been bouncing from hospital
to hospital ever since.

33:21.670 --> 33:24.161
I know you're the smartest guy
in every room you've ever been in,

33:24.170 --> 33:25.535
and no one's ever known it.

33:25.540 --> 33:28.668
People feel threatened by you and try
to sabotage you every chance they get.

33:28.670 --> 33:30.160
You're not a bad person.

33:30.170 --> 33:32.206
You helped save all
of your victims afterwards.

33:32.210 --> 33:33.370
First guy wasn't your fault.

33:33.380 --> 33:36.167
If the EMTs had been there on time,
he would've lived.

33:36.170 --> 33:39.458
Took those guys 13 minutes. Thirteen!

33:40.710 --> 33:43.417
-You want to barricade the door.
-What?

33:43.420 --> 33:44.535
Have me and the kid do it.

33:44.540 --> 33:47.532
Let them see you that you've got two
FBI agents in here doing your bidding.

33:47.540 --> 33:48.950
Yeah, right.
Let you give them a signal?

33:48.960 --> 33:50.450
What signal?
They knew you were in here.

33:50.460 --> 33:53.247
They knew you were armed.
What can I tell them?

33:54.080 --> 33:56.822
What is this

33:56.830 --> 33:58.821
New negotiation tactic?

34:03.210 --> 34:05.781
Yeah, the barricade's
a good idea, though.

34:07.460 --> 34:10.998
-Now why would you want to help me?
-I don't.

34:13.290 --> 34:16.418
You said they knew I was in here.

34:19.000 --> 34:21.787
-I said, "They know you're in here."
-No.

34:21.790 --> 34:24.031
-That's not what you said.
-Why does it matter?

34:24.040 --> 34:27.419
It matters because your partner
wants to help me

34:27.420 --> 34:29.456
even though he doesn't know it.

34:29.920 --> 34:33.242
Go ahead, Boss Man. Tell him why.

34:33.250 --> 34:37.243
If you lie or leave anything out, pop.

34:39.250 --> 34:40.376
They knew he was in here.

34:40.380 --> 34:41.574
They knew he was armed
and dangerous.

34:41.580 --> 34:43.992
And they knew that he was gonna fight
to the last round.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.116
And they sent me in here
with an unarmed kid

34:46.120 --> 34:49.328
who can't shoot his way out
of a wet paper bag.

34:50.330 --> 34:51.877
They set you up.

34:51.880 --> 34:54.701
Exactly, and they're probably laughing
about it right now.

34:54.710 --> 34:57.417
And that's why you want to help me.

34:57.420 --> 34:58.739
I wouldn't say I want to help you.

34:58.750 --> 35:01.241
But when they come in here to get
revenge for the cop you killed,

35:01.250 --> 35:02.615
you're gonna go down fighting.

35:02.620 --> 35:05.578
And in the crossfire,
a lot of us are going to die.

35:05.580 --> 35:09.368
They sent me in here,
I figure why make it easy for them?

35:12.460 --> 35:14.496
Can I talk to you for a moment?

35:23.500 --> 35:25.320
Please don't send your men in yet.

35:25.330 --> 35:27.742
You have to consider the possibility
that your men are dead,

35:27.750 --> 35:29.490
or at least disarmed.

35:29.500 --> 35:32.742
Agent Hotchner
is a very experienced profiler.

35:32.750 --> 35:37.289
He's gonna do whatever he has to do
to get Dowd to like, trust, respect him.

35:37.290 --> 35:41.875
And... And once he does,
he will get Dowd to end this peacefully.

35:41.880 --> 35:45.372
I... Ijust ask you to give him time.

35:45.380 --> 35:48.281
Dowd has already shot 10 people.
He killed a cop!

35:48.790 --> 35:50.075
The cop is dead.

35:50.080 --> 35:54.665
This man is a violent,
deranged paranoid. It's a game.

35:55.710 --> 35:57.826
He's... He's gonna do
whatever he has to.

35:57.830 --> 35:59.786
You send your men in,
they're just gonna become villains

35:59.790 --> 36:02.281
in his little hero fantasy.

36:02.920 --> 36:04.785
You're letting him call all the shots.

36:04.790 --> 36:06.451
How are your unarmed men
going to stop him?

36:06.460 --> 36:09.031
They're not unarmed.
They have his profile.

36:10.790 --> 36:12.826
They understand him.

36:15.750 --> 36:18.742
Three minutes,
and my men are ready to take the ER.

36:18.750 --> 36:21.537
Your men have three minutes.

36:26.960 --> 36:29.611
You know why they took away
boy genius's gun?

36:30.380 --> 36:33.247
-Why?
-He failed his qualification.

36:33.250 --> 36:35.992
Twice a year I gotta listen to him
whine about re-qualifying.

36:36.000 --> 36:39.538
So I tutor him, and he fails again.

36:39.540 --> 36:41.280
You think you've got it rough?

36:41.290 --> 36:44.418
These people done nothing
but undermine me since I got here.

36:44.420 --> 36:46.490
Put them next to the barricade.

36:46.500 --> 36:49.537
That way when they blast their way in
here, both of our problems are solved.

36:49.540 --> 36:52.327
That sort of thing could ruin
a cop's career.

36:52.670 --> 36:56.162
-You are one sick dude.
-How do you think I found you?

37:01.830 --> 37:04.458
Time's up! Ready teams for assault.

37:26.920 --> 37:29.411
-Can I ask you a favor?
-You can ask.

37:29.420 --> 37:32.321
I figure the chances of my getting out
of here alive are pretty slim.

37:32.330 --> 37:33.536
So?

37:33.920 --> 37:36.286
I wanna kick the snot out of this kid.

37:36.290 --> 37:40.169
He's made my life miserable
for three lousy years.

37:45.210 --> 37:46.916
Knock yourself out.

37:55.460 --> 37:57.917
How smart are you now, smart guy?

37:57.920 --> 38:01.959
It's front sight, trigger press,
follow through!

38:01.960 --> 38:06.249
It's not that hard!
A Dalmatian could do it!

38:07.540 --> 38:09.826
Let go, let go!

38:25.040 --> 38:28.077
-Feel better?
-I think he got the message.

38:33.960 --> 38:35.166
What's that?

38:35.170 --> 38:37.286
We go in five, four...

38:41.500 --> 38:43.821
Federal agent!

38:43.830 --> 38:46.663
Hold your fire!

38:47.670 --> 38:49.240
It's all clear!

38:54.290 --> 38:55.780
Shakespeare wrote,

38:55.790 --> 38:59.908
"Nothing is so common
as the wish to be remarkable."

39:09.540 --> 39:11.167
You all right?

39:11.170 --> 39:12.205
Yeah.

39:13.250 --> 39:14.706
Nice shot.

39:15.460 --> 39:17.917
I was aiming for his leg.

39:19.170 --> 39:22.458
I wouldn't have kept kicking, but I was
afraid you didn't get my plans.

39:22.460 --> 39:26.078
I got your plan the minute you moved
the hostages out of my line of fire.

39:26.080 --> 39:28.662
Well, I hope I didn't hurt you too badly.

39:29.920 --> 39:31.990
Hotch, I was
a 12-year-old child prodigy

39:32.000 --> 39:34.571
in a Las Vegas public high school.

39:34.580 --> 39:37.117
You kick like a 9-year-old girl.

39:39.000 --> 39:40.536
No, keep it.

39:41.580 --> 39:45.289
As far as I'm concerned,
you passed your qualification.

39:50.330 --> 39:52.241
Reid, you all right?

40:00.420 --> 40:02.285
Touch, kid.

40:08.920 --> 40:10.205
How you doing?

40:12.290 --> 40:15.578
You were right.
You don't need a gun to kill somebody.

40:22.880 --> 40:26.077
-No, you don't.
-But it helps.

40:26.750 --> 40:29.537
Yes. It does.

40:32.750 --> 40:35.878
I... I know I should feel bad
about what happened.

40:35.880 --> 40:38.201
I mean, I killed a man.

40:38.210 --> 40:40.826
You know, I should feel something.

40:42.710 --> 40:44.200
But I don't.

40:44.210 --> 40:46.997
Not knowing what you feel or...

40:48.170 --> 40:50.786
That's not the same
as not feeling anything.

40:54.670 --> 40:56.877
This is going to hit you.

40:57.710 --> 41:03.205
And when it does, there's only three
facts you need to know.

41:05.750 --> 41:07.957
You did what you had to do.

41:08.750 --> 41:12.163
And a lot of good people are alive
because of what you did.

41:15.210 --> 41:18.611
-What's the third?
-I'm proud of you.
