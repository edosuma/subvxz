Hm-hmm.

01:34.580 --> 01:36.420
Pardon me, ma'am.
You called us

01:36.420 --> 01:38.120
about a leaky faucet.

01:38.120 --> 01:40.250
We'll have it fixed
in a jiffy.

01:50.670 --> 01:53.290
If only there was
a quick fix

01:53.290 --> 01:55.170
for my fading
bloom of youth.

01:56.330 --> 01:59.120
Why should I
of all people

01:59.120 --> 02:01.330
have to age?! Ow.

02:03.250 --> 02:05.250
Hm

02:07.460 --> 02:09.170
There must be a way!

02:38.170 --> 02:40.880
Ooh, ooh!
Ah! Oh!

02:40.880 --> 02:42.120
My eyelash!

02:45.380 --> 02:47.120
Why do they call it

02:47.120 --> 02:49.120
Super

02:49.120 --> 02:51.500
Is there nothing that
can make me young again?

02:56.120 --> 02:58.460
Oh no.
No, no, no!

02:58.460 --> 03:00.170
Nanny, please.

03:00.170 --> 03:01.040
It's just a little leak.

03:01.040 --> 03:04.170
I'll have it fixed
lickety-- whoa -- split.

03:13.080 --> 03:15.710
Oh no!
Roger's gonna
fix something!

03:15.710 --> 03:18.000
I hate to send out
negative energy,

03:18.000 --> 03:19.670
but we're doomed!

03:19.670 --> 03:22.080
All: Take cover!

03:29.040 --> 03:30.920
Hey, where did
everybody go?

03:40.120 --> 03:41.830
There, done.

03:41.830 --> 03:43.710
See, I told you
we didn't need
to call a plumber.

03:45.710 --> 03:47.170
Whoa!

03:52.210 --> 03:53.620
What was that?

04:06.750 --> 04:09.790
Dogs go in
and come out as puppies?

04:15.620 --> 04:18.420
Why, that water
is making them young.

04:19.880 --> 04:23.790
Cruella:
Chickens go in
and eggs come out.

04:23.790 --> 04:26.040
It's the fountain of youth!

04:28.170 --> 04:30.290
I wonder if
it works on humans.

04:37.380 --> 04:39.120
Anita, darling,

04:39.120 --> 04:40.880
get me a glass
of water at once!

04:40.880 --> 04:44.120
You came
all the way over here
for a glass of water?

04:44.120 --> 04:46.620
And your sparkling company.

04:46.620 --> 04:48.620
Make it a large glass!
Would you?

04:49.710 --> 04:51.580
Don't you have water
at your house?

04:51.580 --> 04:53.920
Of course I have
water at home,

04:53.920 --> 04:56.920
but you see,
the water I have at home

04:56.920 --> 05:00.710
is undrinkable
in that it is too, uh...

05:00.710 --> 05:02.080
wet.

05:02.080 --> 05:03.290
Yes, that's right.

05:03.290 --> 05:06.460
And my doctor absolutely
forbids me to drink it.

05:06.460 --> 05:07.710
It's known to
cause a condition

05:07.710 --> 05:10.460
called, uh, H-2-0-itis.

05:10.460 --> 05:12.380
Yes, but in the mean time,

05:12.380 --> 05:14.580
I simply must
have a glass of water!

05:16.540 --> 05:20.330
Memo to myself:
come up with better
preposterous lies.

05:22.040 --> 05:23.710
Mineral water?!

05:23.710 --> 05:24.880
Is there something wrong?

05:24.880 --> 05:28.500
Oh, I'm, uh,
allergic to mineral water,

05:28.500 --> 05:30.580
too many, uh, minerals.

05:31.830 --> 05:35.080
Don't you have
any tap water?

05:35.080 --> 05:37.250
It might be
a tad rusty.

05:37.250 --> 05:39.290
Roger's been
working on the pipes.

05:39.290 --> 05:41.960
Oh, that's fine, really.

05:41.960 --> 05:44.580
I'll just think of it
as gravy.

05:49.960 --> 05:52.080
Mhmm, delicious.

05:52.080 --> 05:54.000
How could that be?

05:54.000 --> 05:55.830
-Well...

05:55.830 --> 05:57.960
-it's water from
our own well.

05:57.960 --> 05:59.620
General Smedley

05:59.620 --> 06:01.580
-put it in years ago
with a water tower...

06:01.580 --> 06:03.620
so the crops
would never go dry.

06:03.620 --> 06:06.880
-Uh.

06:10.380 --> 06:12.830
Scram!
I need this
more than you do.

06:15.790 --> 06:17.380
Finally.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.960
Refreshing.

06:25.960 --> 06:28.960
Well, I'm sure
you'd like me to stay longer,

06:28.960 --> 06:30.790
but I really
must be on my way.

06:30.790 --> 06:31.920
I'll just take one more
for the road.

06:31.920 --> 06:32.920
Ta-ta.

06:36.380 --> 06:37.880
Try it now, Horace!

06:40.080 --> 06:41.710
Horace!

06:41.710 --> 06:44.500
Jasper, do you think
I need a face lift?

06:44.500 --> 06:46.290
You need a brain lift.

06:46.290 --> 06:48.040
Get in here.
Horace!

06:48.040 --> 06:49.380
Jasper:
You get in here!

06:49.380 --> 06:51.670
-Jasper: Hey,
I'm talking to you!

06:51.670 --> 06:53.170
-Get in here and help me!

06:53.170 --> 06:55.620
You're not getting into
Ms. de Vil's makeup, are you?

06:55.620 --> 06:56.710
Horace!

07:06.330 --> 07:07.920
-Memo to myself:

07:07.920 --> 07:09.670
I'm young again!

07:12.170 --> 07:14.790
Oh, it's too good
to be true,

07:14.790 --> 07:16.040
but the mirror
doesn't lie.

07:16.040 --> 07:19.500
I'm a vision
of loveliness.

07:19.500 --> 07:21.670
Oh, Scorch, darling,

07:21.670 --> 07:23.330
don't be afraid.
It really is me.

07:24.750 --> 07:26.790
Oh, that water
made me young,

07:26.790 --> 07:29.960
and that water
is going to make me rich!

07:31.250 --> 07:33.210
I'll bottle it,
over-price it,

07:33.210 --> 07:34.880
and rake in millions!

07:34.880 --> 07:38.210
I'll call it,
"Cruella-grino."

07:40.790 --> 07:42.790
Oh, I forgot.
I need to send
this to the lab

07:42.790 --> 07:44.620
so they can uncover
its secret,

07:44.620 --> 07:46.420
-youth-giving properties.

07:46.420 --> 07:48.500
Oh, why didn't
I steal more?

07:48.500 --> 07:51.830
Uh, pardon me, ma'am,
we're done with the plumbing.

07:51.830 --> 07:54.960
Oh, no you're not.

08:01.750 --> 08:04.210
Hey, what's that
doing here?

08:05.790 --> 08:08.120
Uh-oh, Jasper,
we got company.

08:10.290 --> 08:12.460
Well, look who's here.

08:12.460 --> 08:13.750
Jasper:
Guess what, puppies?

08:13.750 --> 08:15.460
We're gonna steal
all your water

08:15.460 --> 08:17.330
so old hag face
can make millions.

08:17.330 --> 08:18.790
Shh.

08:18.790 --> 08:20.290
That's right.

08:20.290 --> 08:21.710
There won't be
a drop left.

08:21.710 --> 08:24.460
The farm will just dry up
and, poof, go away.

08:26.040 --> 08:27.620
-Wait.

08:27.620 --> 08:29.750
I got a better idea.

08:37.880 --> 08:39.170
Fill her up.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.670
There better not
be any leaks in this one.

09:02.250 --> 09:05.080
-Hey, nothing's going in.

09:14.750 --> 09:16.420
Horace:
If I didn't know
any better,

09:16.420 --> 09:18.710
I'd say these puppies
are trying to stop us

09:18.710 --> 09:20.290
-from stealing the water.

09:20.290 --> 09:21.830
Oh, don't worry,
Horace,

09:21.830 --> 09:22.790
you don't know
any better.

09:22.790 --> 09:24.500
In fact,
you don't know anything.

09:24.500 --> 09:25.960
Horace:
That's a relief.

09:27.830 --> 09:29.670
I told you Swamp Rat
would have helium.

09:29.670 --> 09:32.670
Yeah, it's a good thing
we had Dipstick to trade.

09:32.670 --> 09:36.210
Hmm, I wonder how much
it'll cost to get him back.

09:37.620 --> 09:40.170
-It's finally working.
-We did it!

09:47.620 --> 09:48.710
Help! Help!

09:57.420 --> 09:58.790
There you are!

09:58.790 --> 10:00.120
What are you doing?

10:00.120 --> 10:01.710
Where is my water?

10:01.710 --> 10:03.960
Well, madam.

10:03.960 --> 10:06.960
-There was a slight problem.
-I don't know anything.

10:06.960 --> 10:10.710
Oh! If you want
something stolen right,

10:10.710 --> 10:12.420
steal it yourself.

10:21.380 --> 10:23.670
Well, look who's here.

10:25.210 --> 10:26.790
It's Cruella.
What do we do?

10:26.790 --> 10:29.170
I say we give her
what she wants.

10:29.170 --> 10:31.750
All: Huh?!

10:31.750 --> 10:35.120
Finally,
this fountain of youth
will be mine!

10:38.170 --> 10:39.420
Now!

10:50.790 --> 10:54.080
-Bottle that, Cruella!
-Yeah!

11:07.790 --> 11:10.710
-Um, it's the lab, ma'am.

11:10.710 --> 11:13.540
They say the water
is just ordinary tap water.

11:13.540 --> 11:14.620
I don't
know anything.

11:14.620 --> 11:18.790
Ordinary tap water!

11:26.620 --> 11:28.920
Look at me.

11:28.920 --> 11:31.120
I'm gorgeous anyway.

11:31.120 --> 11:33.250
Why, I don't need youth.

11:33.250 --> 11:35.540
I just need
better lighting.

11:35.540 --> 11:37.420
Mwah.

11:50.830 --> 11:53.210
♪ Lift your legs
and move your butt ♪

11:53.210 --> 11:55.580
♪ Lieutenant Pug
is a great big nut ♪

11:55.580 --> 11:58.080
You think that's funny?

11:58.080 --> 12:00.580
I'll tell you what's funny:
your marching!

12:00.580 --> 12:03.380
My grandma
can move quicker
than you

12:03.380 --> 12:04.710
and she's deaf!

12:04.710 --> 12:06.460
Now move it!

12:06.460 --> 12:08.880
Come on, girls.

12:08.880 --> 12:09.920
The worms won't wait.

12:09.920 --> 12:12.620
-Excuse me, sir, but--
-Quiet, cadet!

12:12.620 --> 12:14.960
-You're breaking stride.
-You're gonna--

12:16.460 --> 12:19.210
Oh, my dear,
I am sorry.

12:19.210 --> 12:20.670
Oh!

12:20.670 --> 12:22.620
-Why don't you watch
where you're going?!

12:22.620 --> 12:24.380
Well, pardon me,

12:24.380 --> 12:26.670
but you didn't exactly
have the right of way.

12:26.670 --> 12:27.880
Listen, worm lover,

12:27.880 --> 12:29.620
as leader of
the Bark Brigade

12:29.620 --> 12:31.620
I always have
the right of way!

12:31.620 --> 12:33.580
Now see here, Lieutenant.

12:33.580 --> 12:37.000
I may not be some kind
of canine commando,

12:37.000 --> 12:39.540
but my work
is just as hard
as yours is,

12:39.540 --> 12:41.670
and I deserve
your respect!

12:41.670 --> 12:44.670
For leading a bunch
of dumb clucks!

12:46.750 --> 12:48.460
Any dog could do that

12:48.460 --> 12:50.710
with one paw tied
behind a New York minute.

12:53.710 --> 12:55.790
Such as yourself
for instance?

12:55.790 --> 12:58.580
-I think not,
Lieutenant Pug.

12:58.580 --> 13:00.620
Oh, really?

13:00.620 --> 13:03.000
Then how's about
you putting your money

13:03.000 --> 13:05.210
where your beak is.
Huh?

13:05.210 --> 13:07.380
Let's switch jobs.

13:07.380 --> 13:11.000
If I can't out-chicken you
by midnight, then I'll--

13:11.000 --> 13:13.250
I'll quit
the Bark Brigade.

13:13.250 --> 13:15.210
It'll be
Cluck Brigade.

13:15.210 --> 13:17.080
And who would
be the judge?

13:17.080 --> 13:20.620
Someone who's real fair,
square, and honest--

13:20.620 --> 13:23.580
a real stand-up dog--
pretty nearly.

13:23.580 --> 13:25.420
-Trident!
-Sir.

13:25.420 --> 13:27.580
I'm not sure
I want to get in--

13:27.580 --> 13:29.920
Relax, Trifold,

13:29.920 --> 13:32.460
this chicken stuff
is a walk in the swamp.

13:33.500 --> 13:36.290
Well, he does
have integrity,

13:36.290 --> 13:37.620
and he is bonded.

13:37.620 --> 13:39.620
Okay, pug, you're on!

13:39.620 --> 13:43.500
My mom's gonna
lead the Bark Brigade?

13:43.500 --> 13:46.080
I got a bad feeling
about this.

13:50.580 --> 13:54.380
What's my first mission
as a chicken, Tripwire?

13:54.380 --> 13:56.380
Looking for worms, sir.

13:56.380 --> 13:59.080
Oh, looking for worms?

13:59.080 --> 14:02.000
Too easy.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.830
-Not with your face!

14:06.420 --> 14:09.540
This is how you do it:

14:09.540 --> 14:14.290
paw up, heft,
roll, check--

14:14.290 --> 14:15.710
no worms--

14:15.710 --> 14:18.710
paw down.
That's the drill!

14:18.710 --> 14:21.170
Now repeat
that procedure.

14:29.580 --> 14:31.420
Ooh, must have
been the wind there.

14:31.420 --> 14:33.670
All right, let's see it.

14:33.670 --> 14:35.620
-Paw up--

14:39.290 --> 14:41.500
You see, right now

14:41.500 --> 14:44.000
a lesser animal
might lose his cool,

14:44.000 --> 14:46.540
but not a Bark Brigade
commander.

14:48.040 --> 14:50.620
You just bought it,
bass bait!

14:56.080 --> 14:57.080
Huh?

15:19.290 --> 15:21.500
That's how you do it!

15:21.500 --> 15:23.880
Right, Triage?

15:25.960 --> 15:27.290
An "F"?

15:27.290 --> 15:30.170
You got to work
with me here.

15:30.170 --> 15:32.880
Sorry, sir.
I have to be impartial.

15:37.420 --> 15:39.540
We've been
at this for hours.

15:42.040 --> 15:44.080
I can't take it
much longer.

15:46.330 --> 15:50.120
Cornelia,
why do we keep
crossing the road?

15:50.120 --> 15:52.880
Why else?
To get to the other side.

15:55.830 --> 15:58.290
Next on the agenda,

15:58.290 --> 16:00.830
uh, chick sitting.

16:00.830 --> 16:03.080
Child's play, Tri-state.

16:04.380 --> 16:05.580
All right, cadet!

16:05.580 --> 16:07.580
I'm your new
commanding officer.

16:07.580 --> 16:10.290
-Peep.

16:10.290 --> 16:13.000
That means
I'm in charge,
I'm the top dog,

16:13.000 --> 16:15.040
I call the shots,
I run the show.

16:15.040 --> 16:16.620
-Peep.

16:16.620 --> 16:19.290
I've got one rule,
and one rule only.

16:19.290 --> 16:21.120
Sit still!

16:21.120 --> 16:24.380
If you can do that,
we'll get along just fine.

16:24.380 --> 16:25.580
Peep.

16:26.580 --> 16:27.580
Where'd she go?!

16:32.620 --> 16:35.790
I told you
to sit still!

16:35.790 --> 16:37.670
-Peep.

16:37.670 --> 16:39.330
Where'd she go?

16:39.330 --> 16:41.380
Peep.

16:52.920 --> 16:55.380
Princess, no!

17:04.750 --> 17:07.670
Now behave yourself,
will you?

17:07.670 --> 17:08.670
Peep.

17:14.380 --> 17:16.500
No!

17:17.830 --> 17:20.620
Huh?

17:22.790 --> 17:26.080
I'm, uh, trying
to grade you on a curve.

17:33.330 --> 17:35.170
What are we doing?

17:35.170 --> 17:37.290
It's called hunting
and pecking.

17:37.290 --> 17:39.080
Peep.

17:39.080 --> 17:42.040
Make the bad chick stop.

17:44.040 --> 17:45.710
Uh, Cornelia,

17:45.710 --> 17:48.670
I was wondering
if we could take
a little kibble break.

17:48.670 --> 17:50.710
Oh, no time, sweetheart.

17:50.710 --> 17:54.000
You've got to memorize
your irrational panic drills
before bedtime.

17:56.170 --> 17:59.620
The sky is falling.
The sky is falling.

17:59.620 --> 18:01.460
I don't mean
to sound judgmental,

18:01.460 --> 18:03.170
but that bird
is cuckoo.

18:03.170 --> 18:05.620
Hey!
That's my mom
you're talking about.

18:05.620 --> 18:09.040
Oh, I'm sorry,
you're right.

18:09.040 --> 18:11.120
Your mother
is cuckoo!

18:11.120 --> 18:15.170
All right, that's it.
It's time for drastic measures.

18:15.170 --> 18:18.210
So now you want
to help me, huh?

18:18.210 --> 18:19.540
Well, forget it!

18:19.540 --> 18:22.420
I saw how glad
you guys were
to get rid of me,

18:22.420 --> 18:24.620
and I don't
need your help.

18:24.620 --> 18:26.080
I've got
a new crew now,

18:26.080 --> 18:28.290
and they love me!

18:28.290 --> 18:30.500
-Oomph!

18:33.710 --> 18:36.580
Why did I open
my big yap?

18:36.580 --> 18:39.120
How many tests
does he have left, Tripod?

18:39.120 --> 18:41.380
Just one, egg sitting.

18:41.380 --> 18:44.710
Egg sitting,
easy peasy.

18:47.670 --> 18:49.080
Sweet goddess of love.

18:49.080 --> 18:52.080
That is the biggest egg
I have ever seen.

18:52.080 --> 18:54.620
That's nothing
for mom.

18:54.620 --> 18:56.580
You should see
what she squeezes out
at Easter.

18:56.580 --> 18:59.170
I can't sit
on that thing.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.250
You can do it, sir.
Just relax,

19:03.250 --> 19:06.750
and remember
there is no pressure.

19:06.750 --> 19:08.580
Don't stay up late,
pups.

19:08.580 --> 19:11.540
We're getting up at dawn
to grouse for grubs.

19:11.540 --> 19:13.080
Listen up, short stuff!

19:13.080 --> 19:14.920
You got to pull this off!
Do you hear me?

19:14.920 --> 19:17.210
You got to
pull this off!

19:25.250 --> 19:27.120
Just five more minutes,
Lieutenant.

19:27.120 --> 19:28.500
You can do it!

19:28.500 --> 19:31.040
Hey, I might
actually make it.

19:31.040 --> 19:33.830
Sir, you are
gonna make it.

19:33.830 --> 19:36.210
You're a better chicken
than I am.

19:36.210 --> 19:37.920
You're right!

19:37.920 --> 19:39.330
I am strong.

19:39.330 --> 19:41.250
I'm invincible!

19:41.250 --> 19:43.330
I am chicken!

19:49.250 --> 19:51.750
No. Oh no!

19:53.880 --> 19:55.960
-Whoa, whoa, ah!
-Puppies: Whoa, oh.

19:55.960 --> 19:58.080
Whoa, gah!

20:08.620 --> 20:10.040
See?

20:10.040 --> 20:12.500
I've got everything
under control.

20:12.500 --> 20:14.500
Whoa-- oomph!

20:15.710 --> 20:18.080
Maybe Cornelia
won't find out.

20:21.040 --> 20:23.290
Sorry, sir.
Rules are rules.

20:26.040 --> 20:27.790
Well, that's that.

20:27.790 --> 20:29.670
The cookie has sung.

20:29.670 --> 20:31.830
The fat lady has crumbled.

20:31.830 --> 20:34.000
The Bark Brigade
is all yours.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.460
Oh, how sad.

20:36.460 --> 20:38.670
Okay, bedtime!

20:38.670 --> 20:41.460
Welcome to
the sinkhole of misery.

20:41.460 --> 20:43.040
You guys want
to watch TV?

20:45.290 --> 20:47.420
Stay back
and you won't get hurt.

20:47.420 --> 20:49.330
All I want
is the chicken!

20:49.330 --> 20:52.170
-Unhand her, you!

20:52.170 --> 20:54.120
Put a sock in it, sister!

20:54.120 --> 20:56.170
That's no way
to treat a lady!

21:04.120 --> 21:07.960
I had no idea
Pug was capable
of such nobility.

21:09.000 --> 21:12.330
Oh, Pug, how can
I ever repay you?

21:12.330 --> 21:15.120
Ah, just doing my job.

21:15.120 --> 21:18.330
Of course
it's not my job any more.

21:18.330 --> 21:21.460
So good-bye forever.

21:21.460 --> 21:24.880
No!
I was wrong
to disrespect you!

21:24.880 --> 21:27.290
Your job is
just as hard as mine!

21:27.290 --> 21:31.920
Don't make me
leave the Bark Brigade!

21:31.920 --> 21:34.040
I've learned
a lesson too.

21:34.040 --> 21:37.500
I had no idea
how to handle
that emergency.

21:37.500 --> 21:40.330
I guess I can't
be top dog

21:40.330 --> 21:42.830
any more than
you can be top chicken.

21:42.830 --> 21:44.790
The Bark Brigade
is yours.

21:44.790 --> 21:47.380
Whew,
what a stroke of luck.

21:47.380 --> 21:50.540
-Yeah, absolutely.

21:50.540 --> 21:52.750
It is a little
strange though.

21:52.750 --> 21:56.080
The koala's diet
consists mostly
of eucalyptus leaves.

21:56.080 --> 21:58.000
Why would it
attack a chicken?

22:03.580 --> 22:06.040
Ah, the things
I have to do

22:06.040 --> 22:07.830
to stay
second in command.
