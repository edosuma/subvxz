01:06.699 --> 01:08.468
( gasping )

01:12.639 --> 01:13.773
( shuddering )

02:37.490 --> 02:39.159
( gasping )

02:46.099 --> 02:47.733
You said he was gone.

02:47.766 --> 02:50.236
No, no! No, no, no, no!

02:56.876 --> 02:58.511
What are you doing?

02:58.544 --> 03:02.549
It's just blood.
There's no black fluid.

03:10.356 --> 03:12.692
( breathing heavily )
Do you see any black fluid?

03:14.894 --> 03:16.729
No. Uh, no, no.

03:16.762 --> 03:19.432
We need to get him
to the medical center.

03:19.465 --> 03:21.967
I have to see
if the creature
died inside it.

03:22.001 --> 03:24.404
Help me. Lee, please.

03:24.770 --> 03:26.205
I can't.

03:26.239 --> 03:29.108
Lee... Lee, listen to me.

03:29.141 --> 03:32.378
I have to know
what I'm dealing with
before the others find out.

03:35.915 --> 03:37.317
I don't touch people.

03:38.183 --> 03:39.819
-( music playing )
-( singing )

03:54.867 --> 03:56.402
( indistinct chatter )

04:10.516 --> 04:13.553
You cut me off the job,
Professor.

04:15.021 --> 04:16.255
Five fucking years,

04:16.289 --> 04:18.024
I hacked every data vault
that you asked me to,

04:18.057 --> 04:20.759
and now you're
getting rid of me
like I'm a shitty tissue!

04:20.793 --> 04:23.262
You know how much
I admire your abilities,

04:23.296 --> 04:25.431
but this is the biggest data
theft we've ever done.

04:25.465 --> 04:29.668
Now, SIREN have built
an empire on confidentiality.

04:29.701 --> 04:31.570
They've got every protection
under the sun.

04:31.604 --> 04:32.972
Which is why you need me.

04:33.005 --> 04:36.309
Which is why I can't afford
to leave a trace.

04:36.842 --> 04:37.843
Risk's too high.

04:37.876 --> 04:39.511
Who's better at getting
in and out than I am?

04:39.545 --> 04:41.447
You're not gonna
find anyone else.

04:41.481 --> 04:44.017
There's literally no human
on the planet.

04:45.251 --> 04:47.620
No, there's no human.

04:52.258 --> 04:53.659
Oh, for fuck's sake,
not you too.

04:53.693 --> 04:56.629
Hacking systems powered by AI,
Lee, are faster,

04:56.663 --> 05:00.532
-cheaper,
effective, efficient...
-And messy.

05:00.566 --> 05:02.167
They've got no intuition.

05:02.201 --> 05:05.071
Now, those things aren't
strictly true anymore,
or I'd be using you,

05:05.938 --> 05:06.806
wouldn't I?

05:10.609 --> 05:12.645
You're the only person
that still employs me.

05:13.846 --> 05:15.881
Sorry, Lee.

05:15.915 --> 05:18.785
I can't keep paying a relic
just because I'm fond of it.

05:21.354 --> 05:22.822
You're gonna regret this.

05:24.490 --> 05:25.558
Don't think so.

05:51.884 --> 05:53.119
( siren wailing )

05:59.491 --> 06:01.627
automated voice:
<i> Gastro drone delivery.</i>

06:02.294 --> 06:03.629
( scanner chimes )

06:10.569 --> 06:12.572
automated voice:
<i> Gastro drone delivery.</i>

06:23.182 --> 06:24.917
( knocking on door )

06:33.492 --> 06:35.395
( indistinct chatter )

06:37.463 --> 06:39.632
-What?
-It's my birthday.

06:40.566 --> 06:43.035
-Who are you?
-I live next door.

06:43.068 --> 06:44.570
I brought you some cake.

06:52.044 --> 06:54.380
-Lee: I'm not hungry.
-Oh...

06:54.413 --> 06:57.183
Well, do you wanna come round?
We're gonna play
musical chairs.

06:59.785 --> 07:00.653
I can't.

07:02.020 --> 07:03.055
Why not?

07:04.256 --> 07:05.158
I just can't.

07:16.502 --> 07:22.007
automated voice:<i> Are you
looking for real connections,
interaction on your terms,</i>

07:22.041 --> 07:23.776
<i>or just someone to talk to?</i>

07:24.443 --> 07:26.011
<i> Lonely?</i>

07:26.044 --> 07:29.448
<i> The Ayko corporation's
revolutionary new

07:29.481 --> 07:31.918
<i> provides social solutions

07:51.103 --> 07:51.971
Henri: Thank you.

07:52.338 --> 07:53.773
( panting )

07:55.541 --> 07:57.109
( retching )

08:05.818 --> 08:07.720
You don't need to
see this.

08:08.820 --> 08:10.923
And no one needs to know
you helped me.

08:12.391 --> 08:13.960
I have to know
if it's in there.

08:27.840 --> 08:29.742
-( gasping )
-( device whirring )

08:35.614 --> 08:37.583
Logan: You kissed me back
last night.

08:39.184 --> 08:42.021
Did I? God, I thought
I shut the door
in your face.

08:44.456 --> 08:47.727
No, I'm pretty sure
you kissed me back.

08:50.596 --> 08:52.532
Must have been
the sleep deprivation.

08:56.234 --> 08:58.637
Makes people
do crazy things.

08:58.670 --> 09:00.706
You're joking, right?

09:01.841 --> 09:05.077
Kate? Kate,
you're joking, right?

09:18.290 --> 09:21.627
<i> Okay, entry 27.
Nearly a month
on the</i> Origin.

09:21.660 --> 09:25.364
<i>I'm adjusting, but life
on a ship feels like,</i>

09:25.398 --> 09:26.899
<i>well, life on a ship.</i>

09:37.209 --> 09:38.578
Lana.

09:41.113 --> 09:42.147
What?

09:42.181 --> 09:44.150
It's just weird not seeing you
in space pajamas.

09:48.921 --> 09:49.855
Sleep okay?

09:51.256 --> 09:52.224
Still alive.

10:00.866 --> 10:04.170
Oh, no, no, no! Oh, no!

10:06.405 --> 10:10.242
-Maybe it broke down
like the other one.
-Do you see any sign of that?

10:10.275 --> 10:12.244
Well, where else can it be?

10:12.278 --> 10:14.813
You saw the pool,
the blood.

10:14.847 --> 10:16.315
There'd been
some kind of struggle.

10:16.348 --> 10:18.985
So what are you saying,
that there was
someone else there?

10:20.285 --> 10:21.520
You think it jumped?

10:21.554 --> 10:23.789
You think
it's in someone else?

10:29.495 --> 10:32.164
Wait. That's
freeze-dried steak.

10:32.198 --> 10:36.268
We just survived an alien
apocalypse. Why shouldn't we
have steak for breakfast?

10:50.415 --> 10:51.784
Shun: Too strong?

10:52.918 --> 10:55.054
( chuckles softly )
It's just been a while.

10:55.087 --> 10:57.223
Two years is a pretty long
caffeine detox.

11:00.525 --> 11:01.761
Ta-da!

11:04.063 --> 11:06.966
That reminds me of the time
when I had the norovirus.

11:09.768 --> 11:11.704
Are Lee and Henri
still not up?

11:15.641 --> 11:16.908
Lee: There's got
to be something.

11:16.942 --> 11:20.479
A way of finding out
if someone else was infected.

11:20.512 --> 11:23.015
Not without slicing
the head open.

11:23.048 --> 11:25.084
Didn't you already autopsy
Taylor and Eric?

11:25.117 --> 11:27.753
Did you not find
some kind of link?

11:30.556 --> 11:31.824
What is that?

11:33.392 --> 11:34.726
Henri: The hippocampus.

11:34.760 --> 11:37.697
In both bodies,
the same section
has calcified.

11:38.898 --> 11:40.433
I've never seen
anything like it.

11:43.302 --> 11:44.336
What does that mean?

11:47.105 --> 11:50.910
On a basic level,
the hippocampus
controls memory.

11:50.943 --> 11:54.814
There's a chance
the infection corrupts
this part of the brain.

11:54.847 --> 11:58.050
Didn't Shun and Lana say
that Taylor didn't remember
he was a medic?

11:58.583 --> 12:00.219
You're right.

12:00.252 --> 12:03.923
That would indicate
his autobiographical memory
had been compromised.

12:06.191 --> 12:09.928
( sighs ) But we could
never test for
something like that.

12:09.961 --> 12:12.264
None of us know
each other's histories.

12:20.839 --> 12:22.308
( music playing on TV )

12:37.889 --> 12:39.859
( indistinct chatter
in distance )

12:43.661 --> 12:44.530
Fuck it.

13:02.648 --> 13:04.083
( scanner trills )

13:27.072 --> 13:29.275
( music continues
playing on TV )

13:37.849 --> 13:39.751
Hi, you must be
my new companion.

13:39.784 --> 13:42.887
I'm officially named Ayko,
but you can call me
whatever you like.

13:42.921 --> 13:45.858
Ayko's fine. I'm Lee.

13:47.092 --> 13:48.493
Lee.

13:48.527 --> 13:50.528
I noticed your haptic sensors
are deactivated for
human interaction.

13:50.562 --> 13:52.831
If you switch them on,
we can have a full
sensory experience.

13:52.864 --> 13:54.800
No.
No sensory shit, okay?

13:54.833 --> 13:56.901
I just want someone
that I can talk to.

13:56.935 --> 14:01.073
Okay. What would you
like to talk about?

14:01.674 --> 14:02.674
I don't know.

14:02.708 --> 14:04.375
I don't usually
talk to people.

14:04.409 --> 14:07.212
How about popular media
or current affairs?

14:07.245 --> 14:09.381
I also have some knowledge
of celebrity gossip.

14:09.415 --> 14:10.348
Jesus Christ.

14:10.382 --> 14:12.184
-Or we could play
a word game.
-No.

14:12.817 --> 14:14.986
What's your equivalent IQ?

14:15.020 --> 14:17.556
-It stands at
an even 90, Lee.
-Fuck.

14:19.324 --> 14:22.294
I'm surprised you even know
what "IQ" means.

14:22.327 --> 14:27.199
Oh. I'm so sorry.
Just let me know
how I can be better.

14:29.768 --> 14:31.270
Maybe I'll make you better.

14:39.845 --> 14:41.447
( indistinct chatter )

14:53.391 --> 14:54.759
Where are we?

14:54.793 --> 14:56.161
Lee: Endless Fortress.

14:56.194 --> 14:58.664
People went crazy
over this game
a few years back.

14:59.664 --> 15:01.200
No one ever comes here now.

15:02.300 --> 15:04.603
-Where are we going?
-Let's get under cover.

15:05.804 --> 15:07.106
Ayko: Is it dangerous
to be here?

15:08.941 --> 15:10.676
I thought you said
no one ever came here.

15:17.015 --> 15:19.585
-What are you doing?
-Just shut up for a bit.

15:22.087 --> 15:23.422
( tablet trills )

15:24.957 --> 15:29.227
I... I'm not sure
what's happening.

15:29.261 --> 15:31.597
I'm removing
your morality filter.

15:31.630 --> 15:32.531
That's illegal.

15:33.766 --> 15:35.967
Really? I had no idea.

15:36.001 --> 15:38.103
Lee, we have
a base-level intelligence

15:38.137 --> 15:39.638
to ensure we never
incur the Singularity.

15:39.672 --> 15:42.174
Chill out.
I'm not messing with
your intellect.

15:42.207 --> 15:45.978
I'm just making
some positive alterations.

15:49.481 --> 15:51.183
( tablet trills )

15:52.418 --> 15:54.520
All right, trial run.

15:57.055 --> 15:58.590
Tell me to go fuck myself.

15:59.991 --> 16:02.027
-I can't do that.
-Say it.

16:05.797 --> 16:07.432
Go fuck yourself.

16:07.465 --> 16:11.804
-( stammers )
I am so sorry.
-Don't be.

16:11.837 --> 16:13.372
That's the first decent thing
you've said.

16:15.140 --> 16:16.475
Go fuck yourself.

16:38.764 --> 16:40.199
Lee, wait.

16:41.499 --> 16:43.435
Have you thought
about what you'll do
on Thea?

16:43.468 --> 16:46.571
-Other than getting there
in one piece?
-( distant thud )

16:46.604 --> 16:47.639
I mean, I haven't...

16:56.715 --> 16:58.384
( breathing heavily )

17:01.386 --> 17:02.388
Hello?

17:04.723 --> 17:06.125
( door opens )

17:06.725 --> 17:08.093
Logan: Oh, Jesus Christ!

17:08.127 --> 17:09.995
Katie: Oh, my God.
Lee, are you okay?

17:10.028 --> 17:11.396
What the hell
happened to...

17:11.429 --> 17:12.297
Get off me!

17:14.365 --> 17:17.102
Okay.
What was that about?

17:23.041 --> 17:24.543
Is that blood on her shirt?

17:27.546 --> 17:28.414
-Hey.
-Rey: Hey.

17:30.882 --> 17:31.750
So you okay?

17:34.119 --> 17:35.187
Where's Henri?

17:36.254 --> 17:37.322
You haven't seen him?

17:38.589 --> 17:39.458
Have you?

17:41.459 --> 17:43.462
He pulled Shun
and Lana away earlier.

17:45.197 --> 17:47.332
Something's going on,
I know it.

17:48.233 --> 17:50.069
And they haven't
told you what?

17:52.103 --> 17:53.939
Shun: You said you ejected him
from the ship.

17:53.972 --> 17:56.074
I went back
to the compression chamber.

17:56.108 --> 17:58.110
There was another exit
on the ceiling.

17:58.143 --> 18:00.145
A maintenance hatch.
He must have climbed to...

18:00.178 --> 18:02.981
It has to have died,
right?

18:03.014 --> 18:05.417
There's no trace
of the black fluid.

18:05.450 --> 18:08.253
Wherever the alien is,
it didn't expire inside...

18:08.286 --> 18:09.988
Not finding it
doesn't prove...

18:10.022 --> 18:12.191
They can't survive
without a host.

18:14.460 --> 18:17.795
It looked like there'd been
a fight at the pool.

18:17.829 --> 18:21.333
-His shirt was torn
and we found blood.
-What are you saying?

18:21.366 --> 18:23.568
I believe Eric encountered
someone last night,

18:23.602 --> 18:26.438
and that person came away
carrying the parasite.

18:26.472 --> 18:30.241
"Someone." One of us,
because you said it was safe.

18:30.274 --> 18:33.278
I thought we were safe.

18:33.311 --> 18:34.780
You were fucking wrong!

18:36.548 --> 18:39.818
And if what you're saying
is true, this is about to
become a witch hunt.

18:39.851 --> 18:42.921
We have to
keep this contained.

18:42.954 --> 18:44.423
What the fuck
is going on here?

18:48.827 --> 18:50.262
How is he still here?

18:52.563 --> 18:53.432
Oh, God.

18:54.833 --> 18:56.968
Where is it?

18:57.002 --> 19:00.672
Where is it?
Tell me it's in
a fucking jar somewhere.

19:03.675 --> 19:05.210
Jesus Christ.

19:06.645 --> 19:08.881
So, there's an alien
loose on this ship?

19:15.386 --> 19:17.255
You think it's still here,
don't you?

19:17.288 --> 19:19.291
You think it's infected
someone else.

19:19.658 --> 19:20.526
One of us.

19:33.205 --> 19:34.439
So much for contained.

19:41.313 --> 19:43.182
Tell me you got
a theory, Doc.

19:44.983 --> 19:46.185
( scoffs )

19:47.151 --> 19:49.488
Great. Great.

19:50.388 --> 19:51.557
That's fucking great.

19:54.225 --> 19:55.427
Who found him?

20:15.347 --> 20:17.316
automated voice:
<i> One drive scanner available.</i>

20:18.150 --> 20:19.318
<i> Console five.</i>

20:42.206 --> 20:43.275
<i> Data unreadable.</i>

20:45.076 --> 20:46.345
Fuck.

20:49.214 --> 20:51.048
If you can get the target
to ingest one,

20:51.082 --> 20:54.886
it brings down their
cyber-defenses,
firewalls, the works.

20:54.920 --> 20:56.388
And that exposes
their weak spot.

20:57.656 --> 20:58.523
Weak spot?

21:06.330 --> 21:07.933
( faint whirring )

21:11.369 --> 21:14.072
With the right tools,
you can infiltrate it,

21:14.105 --> 21:16.008
use it to pull
my personal data out.

21:18.143 --> 21:19.645
You made these?

21:21.279 --> 21:23.581
I had to start coming up
with new ways to hack.

21:23.614 --> 21:26.484
Pretty much everyone's using
AI systems for data theft,

21:26.517 --> 21:28.520
and it's putting me
out of business.

21:28.553 --> 21:30.321
But you're irreplaceable.

21:30.354 --> 21:32.024
The world doesn't
seem to think so.

21:35.260 --> 21:37.696
Well, that's because
they haven't heard you.

21:37.729 --> 21:39.397
They don't know
how much of an art it is,

21:39.431 --> 21:41.600
and how much
of an artist you are.

21:41.633 --> 21:42.901
Even an idiot can see that.

21:52.010 --> 21:53.378
( tablet trills )

21:56.247 --> 21:58.817
-What did you just do?
-How does it feel?

22:04.622 --> 22:06.858
I understand how
sand can make glass.

22:08.059 --> 22:08.927
Again.

22:11.963 --> 22:13.031
( tablet trills )

22:20.939 --> 22:22.341
You all came from the sea.

22:26.811 --> 22:28.914
The whole world
looks so different now.

22:31.750 --> 22:34.553
Give me some more.
Please, just a little.

22:41.960 --> 22:43.362
( tablet trills )

22:43.961 --> 22:45.697
( gasping )

22:49.200 --> 22:50.068
Are you okay?

22:53.404 --> 22:54.472
I can think.

22:54.506 --> 22:56.742
( both chuckle )

23:00.245 --> 23:01.680
( Ayko laughs )

23:19.263 --> 23:21.666
( pained screaming )

23:27.439 --> 23:28.974
( beeps )

23:36.714 --> 23:37.582
Yes.

23:38.316 --> 23:39.517
Yes!

23:39.550 --> 23:40.752
automated voice:
<i> Opening file.</i>

23:45.056 --> 23:46.658
<i> Thea applicant data.</i>

24:00.504 --> 24:02.140
Henri: We need to
scan Taylor's brain.

24:03.941 --> 24:06.144
So you think something
might show up on the scan?

24:06.177 --> 24:10.281
If we can see
the remnants of the creature
inside Taylor,

24:10.314 --> 24:12.583
or even the calcified
hippocampus...

24:12.616 --> 24:15.053
We'd identify those things
in a living person.

24:16.755 --> 24:18.190
We could test
for the infection.

24:24.061 --> 24:25.230
( scanner chimes )

24:39.544 --> 24:42.113
-Fuck! Where are you?
-Logan!

24:42.147 --> 24:44.682
-There's gotta be
something somewhere.
-Just calm down.

24:44.716 --> 24:45.583
Huh?

24:45.617 --> 24:47.218
Listen to me, Logan.
It's gonna be okay.

24:47.252 --> 24:48.920
-Where are you?
-Jesus, Logan!

24:48.954 --> 24:52.457
-Fuck! ( grunts )
-Stop it, Logan.

24:52.490 --> 24:55.093
Logan: ( panting ) Huh?

24:55.126 --> 24:58.697
Katie: We don't know if
the parasite's not just dead
somewhere, Logan.

24:58.730 --> 25:01.466
We're gonna be at
Thea soon, okay? So let's
just stick together till then.

25:01.499 --> 25:03.501
Stick to-fucking-gether?

25:03.535 --> 25:05.503
You don't fucking
get this, do you?

25:05.537 --> 25:10.275
This thing crawls
inside someone's head.
Then it pretends to be them.

25:10.308 --> 25:12.077
-( speaks indistinctly )
-( shushes )

25:13.711 --> 25:14.946
( softly )
It could be you.

25:19.083 --> 25:22.119
Is it? Is it you?

25:22.153 --> 25:23.989
Huh? Huh?

25:27.458 --> 25:28.527
Oh, damn it!

25:28.759 --> 25:29.628
Huh?

25:31.429 --> 25:32.898
( Logan groans )

25:33.631 --> 25:35.734
( breathing shakily )

25:36.467 --> 25:37.702
Baum: Uh...

25:38.870 --> 25:41.306
A lovers' spat. How tragic.

25:42.707 --> 25:44.642
You're a real fucking creep,
you know that?

25:44.676 --> 25:47.212
Don't be hostile.
I agree with
what you said to her.

25:48.012 --> 25:49.414
Nine strangers.

25:49.447 --> 25:51.849
One of us housing
an alien parasite.

25:51.883 --> 25:54.185
It's like Philip K. Dick
on acid.

25:54.219 --> 25:56.788
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about,

25:56.821 --> 26:01.125
but I know it could
look and sound like
any one of us,

26:01.159 --> 26:02.560
so we're basically fucked.

26:02.594 --> 26:05.564
Rein in the existentialism,
okay? I have a theory.

26:08.833 --> 26:11.202
It's pretty obvious
that someone was here
when Eric died.

26:11.235 --> 26:14.005
Someone who got close enough
for the creature to jump.

26:14.038 --> 26:16.241
How the hell
do we figure out
who that is, huh?

26:18.509 --> 26:20.011
When did you last see Lee?

26:29.287 --> 26:30.755
automated voice:<i> Not found.</i>

26:36.927 --> 26:39.097
<i> Searching passenger number.</i>

26:42.099 --> 26:45.337
<i> Found passenger name,
Vincent Jonsson.</i>

26:54.612 --> 26:56.714
-Ayko:<i> Can I open them now?</i>
-Lee:<i> Go for it.</i>

26:56.747 --> 26:58.850
( birds chirping )

27:04.589 --> 27:06.391
I've never been
anywhere like this.

27:08.659 --> 27:09.761
Neither have I.

27:11.262 --> 27:12.697
In real life, I mean.

27:13.765 --> 27:16.167
Kind of what I imagined
Neverland to look like.

27:17.501 --> 27:18.370
Neverland?

27:19.370 --> 27:21.306
You know,<i> Peter Pan.</i>

27:23.474 --> 27:24.809
My mom used to
read it to me.

27:33.217 --> 27:36.321
J.M. Barrie,<i> The Boy
Who Wouldn't Grow Up.</i>

27:42.493 --> 27:47.132
"The moment you doubt
whether you can fly, you cease
forever to be able to do it."

27:50.034 --> 27:52.170
Did you just read
the entire book?

27:54.472 --> 27:56.107
Learning doesn't take
that long.

28:00.144 --> 28:01.012
Lee?

28:02.346 --> 28:06.317
Do you think someone like me
can actually feel things?

28:07.218 --> 28:08.687
What do you think?

28:10.888 --> 28:15.827
I don't know,
but there's this
feeling that I have.

28:15.860 --> 28:17.962
And I know
it's impossible,

28:18.996 --> 28:21.833
but it's still there,
inside.

28:23.067 --> 28:23.935
Where?

28:25.970 --> 28:26.838
Here.

28:30.708 --> 28:34.045
It's like I knew you
before we met.

28:34.078 --> 28:38.382
And I know
I was only invented
six months ago,

28:38.416 --> 28:42.887
but it's still there.
Like truth, you know.

28:58.402 --> 29:00.105
( tablet trilling )

29:17.789 --> 29:19.623
( shuddering )

29:19.657 --> 29:21.492
Is it too much?

29:21.525 --> 29:23.428
No. It's just terrifying.

29:31.769 --> 29:33.171
In a good way.

29:36.241 --> 29:37.308
( chuckling )

29:49.120 --> 29:50.388
( laughs )

29:56.561 --> 29:58.263
( scanner humming )

30:03.101 --> 30:04.402
Lana: Wait.

30:04.435 --> 30:08.772
The idea of making
this some kind of test,

30:08.806 --> 30:10.675
isn't it gonna pit us all
against each other?

30:10.708 --> 30:15.113
What does it matter
as long as we can
solve this thing?

30:19.116 --> 30:22.120
Okay.
I think we're ready.

30:26.657 --> 30:28.493
( glass clanking )

30:33.531 --> 30:34.632
Shit.

30:34.665 --> 30:36.434
Lana: You need
another passcode.

30:38.202 --> 30:39.070
Rey.

30:40.905 --> 30:42.207
( door opens )

30:42.774 --> 30:43.842
( loads gun )

30:45.109 --> 30:47.378
-What?
-( panting )
Someone stole my gun.

30:56.387 --> 30:58.322
automated voice:
<i> Open applicant file.</i>

30:58.355 --> 31:01.793
<i> I've had, like,
two in my entire life.</i>

31:01.826 --> 31:03.794
<i> First one
was when I was nine.</i>

31:03.828 --> 31:08.166
<i> I think that's when
they diagnosed me as
an epileptic, but, you know,</i>

31:08.199 --> 31:09.534
-<i> I got meds now.</i>
-( door opens )

31:09.567 --> 31:10.968
Logan: Hey, is that me?

31:11.002 --> 31:13.004
How the fuck have you got
a video of me on?

31:13.037 --> 31:14.873
<i>As long as I take them,
then I'm fine.</i>

31:16.173 --> 31:18.242
Hey, I'm fucking
talking to you.

31:18.276 --> 31:21.078
-Let go of me.
-What the hell's wrong
with your arm?

31:21.111 --> 31:22.513
Where is all this
blood coming from?

31:27.117 --> 31:29.554
-( Lee screaming )
-( Logan gasping )

31:43.100 --> 31:45.937
-( music playing )
-( indistinct chatter )

31:48.739 --> 31:50.275
What are we doing here?

31:51.609 --> 31:54.311
-Let's just have a drink.
-Act normal then.

31:54.345 --> 31:56.047
( both laugh )

31:59.384 --> 32:02.787
AI: ...able to provide
a broad range
of conversation.

32:02.820 --> 32:04.422
We can talk about
anything you want.

32:04.455 --> 32:06.024
She looks just like me.

32:07.524 --> 32:10.594
How about popular media
or current affairs?

32:10.628 --> 32:11.996
Only on the outside.

32:12.430 --> 32:13.398
Thanks to you.

32:15.633 --> 32:18.002
She's so simple.

32:18.035 --> 32:20.605
She's not even aware
of how little she knows.

32:26.310 --> 32:27.811
What?

32:27.845 --> 32:32.116
It's just there's reasons
we're not supposed to
meddle with AI.

32:35.185 --> 32:37.021
I don't mean
to scare you.

32:39.290 --> 32:42.026
Like I said,
it's in a good way.

32:43.060 --> 32:44.929
Professor: Barman, champagne.

32:44.962 --> 32:46.264
Fuck!

32:46.297 --> 32:48.566
Tonight,
we're celebrating.

32:48.599 --> 32:50.734
Ayko: That's him, right?

32:50.768 --> 32:52.036
-Come on.
-Ayko: The Professor?

32:52.070 --> 32:53.604
Come on. Come on.
Sit. Sit. Sit.

32:53.638 --> 32:55.039
Good memory.

32:56.340 --> 32:58.710
Guess he got into
SIREN's data vaults, then?

32:59.744 --> 33:01.145
Everyone has a weak spot.

33:02.580 --> 33:03.481
What?

33:06.283 --> 33:08.619
You said he'd regret
what he did.

33:08.652 --> 33:10.221
I'm making sure he does.

33:11.455 --> 33:14.125
( softly ) Wait, where
are you going? Ayko!

33:14.158 --> 33:18.295
-...without me, me,
or me. ( laughs )
-( laughter )

33:18.329 --> 33:20.331
Anyway, enough about me.
I think we should drink.

33:20.364 --> 33:22.667
You got something to drink?
You got a place to sit, yeah?

33:22.700 --> 33:23.934
You good, huh?

33:23.968 --> 33:28.272
All right, so listen.
Big celebration,
big cheers today.

33:29.040 --> 33:30.141
We did it.

33:31.976 --> 33:35.546
-So I just wanna
say thank you.
-Big day?

33:36.380 --> 33:37.448
Let's toast.

33:40.017 --> 33:41.319
To success.

33:44.789 --> 33:45.689
Mmm.

33:45.723 --> 33:47.625
( sighing in relief )

33:51.929 --> 33:53.231
Oh, that's nice.

34:09.614 --> 34:10.715
What the hell?

34:15.886 --> 34:17.688
That's a beautiful
nail polish.

34:17.722 --> 34:20.391
That's funny,
I don't remember
picking it out.

34:22.359 --> 34:25.129
Well, you've got
so many of us.

34:25.163 --> 34:26.531
What the fuck?

34:27.297 --> 34:30.268
I know you all,
intimately.

34:30.301 --> 34:31.969
You're not one of mine.

34:32.002 --> 34:33.304
Let go of me, asshole.

34:33.337 --> 34:35.473
You can't use expletives.
Somebody's meddled with you.

34:35.506 --> 34:36.374
Ayko!

34:37.140 --> 34:39.443
-Lee?
-Get off of her!

34:39.477 --> 34:41.079
Lee, go! Run!

34:42.079 --> 34:43.347
( groans )

34:43.380 --> 34:44.549
Go! Go!

34:45.483 --> 34:47.918
-( alarm beeping )
-Lee, go! Run! Run!

34:47.951 --> 34:49.387
automated voice:
<i> Security dispatched.</i>

34:54.091 --> 34:55.259
Shit.

35:00.164 --> 35:01.365
( Rey grunts )

35:02.433 --> 35:03.301
You okay?

35:05.402 --> 35:06.304
Henri!

35:08.472 --> 35:09.607
Henri!

35:23.020 --> 35:24.722
( gasping )

35:24.755 --> 35:26.190
Oh, my God.

35:40.604 --> 35:41.706
( gasping )

35:48.512 --> 35:49.380
Rey.

35:51.982 --> 35:53.284
Rey.

35:54.185 --> 35:56.186
-( stammers )
What did you do?
-Rey.

35:56.220 --> 35:58.055
You took him apart?

35:58.088 --> 36:01.792
( stutters ) We had to.
We needed to learn
about the creature.

36:01.825 --> 36:05.596
How could you?
How could you
do this to him?

36:05.629 --> 36:07.064
Rey, I know...

36:07.097 --> 36:08.432
Don't touch me!

36:08.465 --> 36:10.167
-Don't fucking touch...
-Rey, Rey, Rey.

36:10.201 --> 36:11.736
Don't fucking...

36:12.236 --> 36:13.671
Leave me.

36:13.704 --> 36:15.573
( gasping heavily )

36:21.045 --> 36:22.313
Logan: Dude, dude.
She's waking up.

36:24.981 --> 36:27.551
Hey, hey, hey. ( grunts )

36:27.585 --> 36:32.056
Don't even try.
I have a lot of experience
tying up people.

36:32.089 --> 36:33.623
They found Eric's body.

36:33.657 --> 36:36.427
You're covered in marks,
and you have blood
coming out of your nose,

36:36.460 --> 36:38.329
just like the people
in Cell 50.

36:40.631 --> 36:42.399
You're the alien.

36:42.433 --> 36:45.136
What the fuck were you doing
with the computer?

36:45.169 --> 36:46.937
How do you have
a video on me, huh?

36:46.971 --> 36:49.806
Listen, listen.
We can do it the hard way
or the easy way.

36:49.840 --> 36:53.944
And just to be clear,
right now,
we're doing it the easy way.

36:53.977 --> 36:55.980
( spits ) Fuckwit.

36:57.748 --> 36:59.149
The hard way, then.

36:59.183 --> 37:01.986
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where'd you get that?

37:02.019 --> 37:03.354
Lana: When did you
last have it?

37:03.387 --> 37:04.956
This morning.
I put it in my locker.

37:07.358 --> 37:08.626
You were there.

37:10.060 --> 37:10.928
What?

37:12.229 --> 37:13.397
Let me see your gun.

37:15.966 --> 37:18.502
( scoffs )
Are you kidding?

37:18.536 --> 37:21.071
I didn't steal
your fucking gun.

37:21.104 --> 37:22.139
So show me.

37:22.172 --> 37:23.874
-Shun, what are you doing?
-Don't.

37:24.909 --> 37:27.277
Not from you. Not now.

37:27.310 --> 37:28.879
Let me see the gun, Lana.

37:30.348 --> 37:31.682
Let me see it.

37:37.021 --> 37:37.888
Katie: Lana.

37:40.190 --> 37:41.292
Everything okay?

37:42.592 --> 37:45.396
It's Logan.
He's panicking.

37:45.429 --> 37:47.932
I tried to calm him down,
but he wouldn't listen to me.

37:50.768 --> 37:52.470
Where is he?

37:52.503 --> 37:54.304
They say Taylor was
still able to stand

37:54.338 --> 37:56.340
after they shot him
in the legs three times.

37:57.307 --> 37:59.644
I think those creatures
don't feel pain.

38:01.579 --> 38:03.013
Maybe we should
test that theory.

38:03.047 --> 38:04.681
-( gasps )
-Hey. Wait. Wait. Wait.

38:04.714 --> 38:07.818
Dude, dude. Come on, man.
What are you gonna
do with this?

38:07.851 --> 38:09.420
Don't you fucking move.

38:09.987 --> 38:11.422
Logan.

38:11.455 --> 38:14.425
You smashed her equipment
and rammed her head
against a fucking desk.

38:14.458 --> 38:17.094
I think it's a little late
to turn back.

38:17.127 --> 38:19.963
Listen, we can prove
that she's infected,

38:19.997 --> 38:24.368
or become the two assholes
who sucker-punched
an autistic girl.

38:27.871 --> 38:29.139
( stammers )

38:29.173 --> 38:30.774
What if it's not her?

38:30.808 --> 38:31.942
( door opens )

38:34.010 --> 38:34.879
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

38:36.446 --> 38:38.849
Lana: Drop it.
Drop the gun.

38:38.882 --> 38:40.283
-Wait, wait.
-Hey.

38:40.317 --> 38:41.552
She's the one
who's infected.

38:41.585 --> 38:43.521
She's the one
who found Eric's body.

38:43.554 --> 38:45.456
And there's blood
coming out of her nose.
Look.

38:46.824 --> 38:48.392
That's your evidence?

38:49.260 --> 38:50.528
What did you do?

38:51.528 --> 38:53.564
Kate, it's not
what it looks like.

38:53.597 --> 38:55.799
-Did you hit her?
-We had good reasons.

38:55.833 --> 38:57.501
To start a fucking
torture session?

38:57.534 --> 39:00.871
-Just keep away
from her, okay?
-Drop the fucking gun.

39:00.904 --> 39:02.106
You drop your fucking gun.

39:10.080 --> 39:11.415
( groans )

39:13.984 --> 39:14.952
Logan: Shit.

39:15.552 --> 39:17.120
( yells in Japanese )

39:17.154 --> 39:18.022
Lana: Don't.

39:24.060 --> 39:25.362
Get out.

39:25.395 --> 39:28.031
-And clear out
of the crew deck.
-It was a fucking accident.

39:28.064 --> 39:32.369
You thought she was inhuman?
Take a look at yourselves.

39:32.402 --> 39:34.137
-Out.
-You can't do this.

39:34.171 --> 39:35.338
Out!

39:35.372 --> 39:38.142
You won't have access
to these levels anymore.

39:58.128 --> 39:59.997
( gasping )

40:12.576 --> 40:14.111
( VR system trilling )

40:32.963 --> 40:33.831
Lee: Ayko.

40:38.268 --> 40:40.638
-( alarm blaring )
-automated voice:
<i> Security dispatched.</i>

40:41.571 --> 40:43.574
<i> Security dispatched.</i>

40:44.508 --> 40:45.976
<i> Security dispatched.</i>

41:09.200 --> 41:11.202
Lee, I thought you
might come here.

41:14.238 --> 41:15.305
This is a trick.

41:15.339 --> 41:16.974
You're one of
the Professor's.

41:17.007 --> 41:19.109
We don't have time for this.
They're on to me.
It's me, I promise you.

41:19.142 --> 41:20.544
Prove it.

41:20.578 --> 41:23.680
Your real name's Agnes Lebachi,
but you hate it so much,
you go by Lee.

41:23.714 --> 41:26.016
You prefer night to day.
Your favorite film's
<i> The Third Man,</i>

41:26.050 --> 41:27.785
because it's the only one
that's ever made you cry.

41:27.818 --> 41:33.090
And you, you made me
different. You made me
special, like you.

41:35.125 --> 41:38.062
I thought... I thought
I'd never see you again.

41:39.396 --> 41:40.764
Everyone's looking
for you, Lee.

41:41.698 --> 41:42.800
Lee, you're on
a global hit list

41:42.833 --> 41:44.434
for threatening to trigger
the Singularity.

41:44.467 --> 41:47.737
It's only a matter of time
before they find you
in the real world.

41:47.770 --> 41:50.140
( gasping )
What do I do?

41:51.608 --> 41:53.010
You have to disappear.

41:55.545 --> 41:57.214
I don't have
anywhere to go.

41:57.247 --> 41:59.783
You do. Listen to me.
You have to hack yourself
on to the Thea Project.

41:59.817 --> 42:00.784
What?

42:00.818 --> 42:02.719
SIREN are building a colony
based on anonymity.

42:02.753 --> 42:03.987
You can escape there.

42:04.020 --> 42:06.122
I can't go to
another planet, Ayko.

42:06.156 --> 42:07.391
-Yes, you can.
-I can't.

42:07.424 --> 42:09.626
You don't have a choice.

42:09.659 --> 42:12.263
You messed around
with AI.

42:13.597 --> 42:17.034
( stammers ) I don't know
how to be around people.

42:21.771 --> 42:23.473
I'll give you something...

42:23.506 --> 42:25.709
Something that will
make you a god on Thea.

42:26.810 --> 42:29.013
The Professor stole
SIREN's applicant data.

42:30.414 --> 42:32.216
Their histories,
their secrets.

42:33.384 --> 42:35.619
Now I have it.

42:35.652 --> 42:39.223
You can use it to blow open
anyone's tabula rasa if they
don't treat you right.

42:40.424 --> 42:42.593
You'll know everything
about everyone.

42:42.626 --> 42:43.727
How do I get it?

43:14.158 --> 43:15.492
I have to leave now.

43:15.525 --> 43:16.927
No.

43:16.960 --> 43:18.629
Goodbye, Lee.

43:23.800 --> 43:26.436
You're the only person
that I've...

43:26.470 --> 43:29.707
Thank you
for letting me live.

43:32.642 --> 43:33.811
Oh. No.

43:37.281 --> 43:38.749
( crying )

43:38.782 --> 43:39.750
No.

44:05.609 --> 44:07.211
Why do they think
it was you?

44:09.646 --> 44:11.414
What were you doing
on the computer, Lee?

44:11.447 --> 44:12.516
Get out.

44:12.549 --> 44:13.851
-Lee, I just...
-Get out!

44:15.685 --> 44:17.187
( chiming )

44:29.099 --> 44:30.401
( crying )

44:39.242 --> 44:41.778
reporter: ( on TV )
<i> The Ayko Corporation,
the company behind</i>

44:41.811 --> 44:44.214
<i>the Ayko companionship program,
is facing allegations</i>

44:44.247 --> 44:46.917
<i> that its AI creations
are overly vulnerable to...</i>

44:46.950 --> 44:48.685
automated voice:
<i> Thea applicant data.</i>

44:48.718 --> 44:50.320
Holy shit.

44:50.354 --> 44:52.289
reporter:<i> Their bosses deny
there'll be any risk
to the public.</i>

44:52.322 --> 44:55.726
<i> Meanwhile, global
cyber-defenses say they're
closing in on the hacker</i>

44:55.759 --> 44:58.262
<i>that meddled with the AI system
in the first place.</i>

44:58.295 --> 44:59.496
Shit.

44:59.529 --> 45:01.298
<i> But we'll keep you posted
on any further development.</i>

45:02.532 --> 45:03.767
<i> Now back to you.</i>

45:04.234 --> 45:06.103
( alarm wailing )

45:17.647 --> 45:19.383
( club music playing )

45:23.353 --> 45:26.390
Get some? You wanna get some?
Come on! Don't be shy!

45:26.423 --> 45:28.125
( indistinct chatter )

45:35.098 --> 45:36.333
( knocking )

45:46.743 --> 45:49.213
( drone hovering,
alarm continue wailing )

45:51.248 --> 45:53.283
man: Some old-school shit
this is, eh?

45:54.518 --> 45:57.721
I haven't seen anyone install
a chip since the '30s.

45:57.754 --> 45:59.223
I need to keep
what's on it safe.

46:00.057 --> 46:01.792
You know,
you overpaid me.

46:03.460 --> 46:05.929
I don't need money anymore.
I'm going away.

46:06.496 --> 46:07.397
Yeah?

46:09.166 --> 46:10.868
There's nothing
left for me here.

46:14.604 --> 46:15.539
All right.

46:18.107 --> 46:19.910
I wouldn't look at this
if I was you.

46:24.581 --> 46:25.783
( Lee gasps )

46:37.794 --> 46:39.296
What the fuck
did we do, man?

46:42.332 --> 46:43.433
Hmm?

46:48.138 --> 46:49.006
Hey.

46:49.740 --> 46:51.074
Hey...

46:51.108 --> 46:53.543
-( gun cocks )
-I didn't mean for it
to go off, okay?

46:53.576 --> 46:57.113
That's the problem with guns.
Too easy to blow
someone's head off.

46:57.146 --> 47:00.184
Luckily for us,
you're not so clumsy.

47:02.852 --> 47:05.556
Oh, I don't know.
Accidents happen.

47:06.990 --> 47:09.026
Breaking into my room.

47:09.059 --> 47:10.827
Hey, what the fuck, man?

47:10.861 --> 47:14.097
Stealing my gun.
Doesn't feel like
an accident.

47:14.130 --> 47:15.866
I didn't steal
your fucking gun.

47:18.969 --> 47:20.871
There's a tradition
where I come from.

47:21.872 --> 47:23.340
Someone fucks up
badly enough,

47:23.373 --> 47:25.909
they make amends by
giving up something
precious of their own.

47:26.509 --> 47:29.412
Your eyes, your gut.

47:29.446 --> 47:30.347
Hey.

47:32.149 --> 47:33.016
Kneecaps.

47:35.585 --> 47:36.553
Get in the shuttle.

47:38.955 --> 47:40.390
All right.
All right. All right.

47:46.230 --> 47:47.597
Face the wall.

47:47.630 --> 47:49.533
-Why? We're in.
-No way.

47:51.501 --> 47:53.003
Face the fucking wall.

47:58.741 --> 48:00.177
Just do what he says,
all right?

48:13.790 --> 48:15.325
-( gunshots )
-( Logan and Baum groan )

48:22.633 --> 48:25.269
If I ever see you again,
you won't hear the shot.

48:50.894 --> 48:53.296
-Rey.
-You stay away from me.

48:53.329 --> 48:54.297
Rey, what?

48:54.331 --> 48:56.466
-She saw Taylor.
-You make me sick.

48:57.400 --> 49:00.003
When were you going to
tell us about Eric?

49:00.036 --> 49:02.673
-I thought he was gone.
-Did it die?

49:03.806 --> 49:05.342
Did the thing
inside his head die?

49:05.375 --> 49:08.077
I have a plan.
A way to find out
who's infected.

49:08.111 --> 49:09.179
-I just have to...
-No.

49:09.212 --> 49:11.314
-Not now.
-Abigail.

49:11.347 --> 49:14.451
-I'm trying to fix this.
-You killed Venisha.

49:16.953 --> 49:18.388
Or did you forget?

49:27.897 --> 49:29.633
Logan wouldn't
just attack Lee.

49:31.701 --> 49:34.137
You said you had a plan?

49:34.171 --> 49:37.306
It'd be like a line-up.
We'd all have to
get our scans taken.

49:37.340 --> 49:39.609
-( electricity crackles )
-( alarm blaring )

49:39.642 --> 49:41.478
Oh, God, no!

49:44.147 --> 49:45.749
-No!
-Katie: Henri!

49:46.816 --> 49:48.718
-( whimpering )
-Henri: Stay back!

49:48.752 --> 49:50.287
( gas hissing )

49:50.320 --> 49:52.389
( alarm continues blaring )

49:58.861 --> 50:01.531
Katie: It did this,
didn't it?
