00:06.750 --> 00:09.587
<i>You may not know
who any of these people are,</i>

00:09.619 --> 00:11.876
<i>but you definitely know
the people they've styled.</i>

00:14.692 --> 00:16.661
<i>These stylists use their visions</i>

00:16.693 --> 00:19.297
<i>to help shape and push
the culture through fashion.</i>

00:19.329 --> 00:21.732
<i>Now, some people might think
what they do is easy...</i>

00:25.536 --> 00:27.806
<i>I mean, how hard is it
to put designer clothes</i>

00:27.838 --> 00:29.439
<i>on beautiful people, right?</i>

00:32.042 --> 00:35.979
<i>Well, style may be eternal,
but taste is subjective,</i>

00:36.012 --> 00:39.317
<i>and it can be harder than you think...</i>

00:45.122 --> 00:48.649
<i>Especially because
the Internet</i> never <i> forgets.</i>

00:53.064 --> 00:54.698
So, why did I decide to focus on styling

00:54.731 --> 00:56.634
instead of actual design?

00:56.667 --> 00:59.091
Oh, probably because
the First Lady of America

00:59.116 --> 01:00.646
basically wrote to me personally

01:00.671 --> 01:03.548
and told me that I am, quote,
"the future of fashion."

01:03.573 --> 01:08.346
"Zoey, fantastic work. Best, Michelle."

01:08.379 --> 01:09.814
Okay, whatever.

01:09.846 --> 01:12.177
I'm reading in between the lines.

01:12.202 --> 01:15.106
So, once I realized styling
was my thing,

01:15.139 --> 01:17.842
there was no way I was gonna
waste another second.

01:17.874 --> 01:19.644
Time to start building my portfolio.

01:24.382 --> 01:25.850
Hey, guys.

01:25.883 --> 01:27.685
The Zoey Johnson Styling Experience

01:27.717 --> 01:29.020

01:33.523 --> 01:36.193

02:12.908 --> 02:16.734
<i>So, the first week of the
Zoey Johnson Styling Experience</i>

02:16.767 --> 02:18.903
<i>wasn't exactly what I imagined.</i>

02:18.935 --> 02:22.072
<i>In fact, things were so bleak,
I got removed from Yelp</i>

02:22.106 --> 02:24.475
<i>for posting too many fake reviews.</i>

02:24.507 --> 02:27.077
<i>But things took a turn
when the twins decided</i>

02:27.111 --> 02:30.982
<i>I could help rebrand them
from "All-American" girls...</i>

02:31.014 --> 02:32.983
<i>to something more sophisticated</i>

02:33.017 --> 02:34.585
<i>in hopes of getting followers and money</i>

02:34.618 --> 02:36.387
<i>to push products on the 'Gram.</i>

02:36.419 --> 02:38.446
<i>And so far, we were on our way.</i>

02:38.471 --> 02:39.946
Oh!

02:39.971 --> 02:42.352
Guys, this is such a moment.

02:42.377 --> 02:43.761
You don't even know.

02:43.793 --> 02:45.897
Cool. But why does this "moment"

02:45.929 --> 02:47.931
have us looking
like 40-year-old white women

02:47.965 --> 02:50.902
in those black-and-white movies
with no black people in them?

02:50.935 --> 02:52.836
What are you talking about?

02:52.869 --> 02:56.506
This is very excellent,
very vintage knock-off couture.

02:56.540 --> 03:00.578
Wait, so dead people wore this?
Oh, my God.

03:00.611 --> 03:03.047
We really appreciate you trying
to have a vision

03:03.079 --> 03:04.781
for our rebrand, but we're trying to get

03:04.815 --> 03:07.952
to that Chastity Decas Cal U
banner level, you know?

03:09.887 --> 03:11.255
This is easily a 10K-a-month feed.

03:13.223 --> 03:14.459
Chastity Decas?

03:14.492 --> 03:17.561
But y'all are just so much...
better than that.

03:17.595 --> 03:19.897
Oh, no, no, no. I know I'm not better

03:19.929 --> 03:23.200
than her 500,000 followers
and athletic sponsorships.

03:23.233 --> 03:24.302
Same. And you don't see her

03:24.334 --> 03:26.403
wearing haunted shit
that some ghost bitch wore.

03:26.436 --> 03:27.772
Mm.

03:27.804 --> 03:30.273
All right. They do not
understand what "vintage" means.

03:30.306 --> 03:33.577
We've had this ghost
conversation three times.

03:33.611 --> 03:37.280
I'm trying to rebrand you
as fashionable, classy athletes.

03:37.314 --> 03:38.583
And think about it... our last post

03:38.615 --> 03:41.251
got 200 new followers, so...

03:45.121 --> 03:47.424
This post of Chastity
dry-humping a basketball

03:47.458 --> 03:49.627
got her 5,000 likes.

03:49.660 --> 03:51.294
We want dry-humping numbers!

03:51.328 --> 03:52.463
Y'all talking about Chastity Decas?

03:52.495 --> 03:53.630
Uh... Uh...

03:53.663 --> 03:54.798
Damn, she's fire.

03:54.832 --> 03:55.799
Thank you.

03:55.833 --> 03:57.268
Not helping.

03:57.300 --> 03:59.336
And unfollow her!

03:59.369 --> 04:01.938
Ceviche? Really?

04:04.174 --> 04:06.344
You know, scientists say that shrimps

04:06.376 --> 04:08.311
have the most feelings
of any living thing.

04:08.345 --> 04:11.082
Mm. Hey, um, hot tip for ya...

04:11.114 --> 04:14.317
if you're gonna be, like, the
non-rent-paying fourth roommate,

04:14.351 --> 04:16.921
maybe keep your vegan judgment
to yourself.

04:16.954 --> 04:18.288
Harsh, harsh.

04:18.322 --> 04:20.091
But I understand that's just
the mercury talking

04:20.123 --> 04:21.091
from all that raw fish.

04:21.125 --> 04:22.326
- Mm.
- Not you.

04:22.358 --> 04:24.195
Thank you. Appreciate that, Luca.

04:24.228 --> 04:25.696
Bon appétit, chief.

04:25.728 --> 04:29.300
Posts like these
just don't feel like you guys.

04:29.332 --> 04:31.301
Look, being a nationally ranked athlete

04:31.334 --> 04:33.036
isn't enough to get paid.

04:33.070 --> 04:34.337
But being IG famous will help us

04:34.370 --> 04:36.173
get those endorsements we need.

04:36.207 --> 04:38.041
Yeah. I mean, the Gonzalez twins,

04:38.074 --> 04:40.344
Michelle Jenneke... sure,
they're all great athletes,

04:40.377 --> 04:42.947
but looking good is what
got them to that next level.

04:42.980 --> 04:44.315
Those girls are making hella bank.

04:44.348 --> 04:46.784
Just seems so... basic.

04:46.817 --> 04:48.319
And I'm here trying to make art.

04:48.351 --> 04:50.387
You know what isn't basic? Making money.

04:50.421 --> 04:52.623
We have a four-year window
as Cal U athletes,

04:52.656 --> 04:55.059
so it's now or never.

04:55.091 --> 04:58.296
Sorry, girl. But maybe you're
just not the stylist for us.

04:58.329 --> 05:00.798
Wait.

05:02.199 --> 05:04.368
Um, are they firing me?

05:04.401 --> 05:06.304
Could the Zoey Johnson
Styling Experience

05:06.336 --> 05:08.038
be over before it began?

05:08.072 --> 05:10.708
How could Michelle Obama
have been so wrong?

05:10.740 --> 05:12.175
Um, hold on.

05:12.209 --> 05:13.511
Um...

05:13.543 --> 05:16.214
could you guys give me one more shot?

05:17.947 --> 05:20.017
So, no more ghost clothes?

05:20.050 --> 05:22.320
No more ghost clothes. Done.

05:22.353 --> 05:23.487
Mm-hmm.

05:23.519 --> 05:25.089
Thank you.

05:31.262 --> 05:33.430
Excuse me.

05:35.000 --> 05:41.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:06.497 --> 06:09.467
What's up, bitches?

06:09.500 --> 06:11.469
Nothing's up. Noth...
The elevator is going up.

06:11.502 --> 06:13.271
- That's about it.
- Yeah.

06:15.938 --> 06:18.409
Although the new direction
isn't exactly what I envisioned

06:18.442 --> 06:21.279
for Jazz and Sky, I delivered.

06:21.312 --> 06:25.483
Now... is it something
I'm putting in my portfolio?

06:25.515 --> 06:26.549
Probably not.

06:26.582 --> 06:29.919
But I pivoted,
leaned into my clients' vision,

06:29.952 --> 06:33.390
made them happy,
saved my first job, so...

06:33.423 --> 06:35.459
Basically, killing the game.

06:35.491 --> 06:37.294
- Zoey, props!
- Oh, hey.

06:37.327 --> 06:39.397
You have the twins looking fire
in that new photo.

06:39.430 --> 06:41.232
- It's trending hard.
- It's trending?

06:41.264 --> 06:42.666
Oh, yeah. It's being reposted
by LADbible,

06:42.699 --> 06:44.435
Egotastic, Barstool Sports...

06:44.468 --> 06:46.604
I don't know
what any of those sites are,

06:46.637 --> 06:48.105
but trending is good!

06:48.137 --> 06:49.774
Oh, yeah. So, these are the sites I hit

06:49.807 --> 06:51.809
when I want to look at porn
but I'm in a public place

06:51.841 --> 06:53.844
and I can't look at real porn, you know?

06:53.877 --> 06:55.312
Wait, what?

07:06.557 --> 07:08.159
Oh, my God!

07:14.510 --> 07:18.415
Zoey, where did you think
this whole rebrand thing

07:18.449 --> 07:20.151
was going when you had them posing

07:20.183 --> 07:22.587
like they were fused at the, uh...

07:22.620 --> 07:24.855
- you know.
- Hoo-haa.

07:24.887 --> 07:27.820
Well, I thought I was gonna be
doing something provocative

07:27.845 --> 07:30.828
and, uh... European.

07:30.853 --> 07:34.692
Not something that would compel
Morphman88 to admit

07:34.724 --> 07:37.653
that "the Forster twins
got him on an all-ass diet."

07:37.678 --> 07:38.696
- Mm.
- Yeah.

07:38.729 --> 07:40.363
Morphman had a lot to say...

07:40.397 --> 07:42.299
- He really did.
- Look, y'all are trippin'.

07:42.332 --> 07:44.368
This is exactly what we wanted.

07:44.400 --> 07:47.270
Look, Sky and I got 2,000 followers

07:47.303 --> 07:48.690
in the last three hours.

07:48.733 --> 07:50.736
Yeah, for selling smut.

07:50.761 --> 07:52.896
It's not smut, grandma. It's sexy.

07:52.929 --> 07:54.932
Sky and Jazz are taking control
over their own image...

07:54.965 --> 07:57.220
- Yes.
- ...and making it work for them.

07:57.245 --> 07:58.395
I think it's empowering.

07:58.420 --> 08:00.704
Yes, and I feel very empowered.

08:00.737 --> 08:03.040
For our next post,
Copper Calves reached out to us,

08:03.072 --> 08:06.376
and they want us to model
in their compression socks.

08:08.911 --> 08:10.966
- And only socks?
- Oh, God.

08:11.008 --> 08:12.743
Okay, I just have no clue how going from

08:12.775 --> 08:14.544
vintage knock-off couture
to Copper Calves

08:14.578 --> 08:16.480
isn't a total downgrade.

08:16.513 --> 08:18.948
Because the Copper Calves people
know that

08:18.982 --> 08:20.917
their target customers are sitting

08:20.951 --> 08:24.621
in their mother's basements,
spending the day... you know.

08:24.655 --> 08:26.256
- Jerking it.
- Whatever.

08:26.289 --> 08:27.725
I don't care what they're doing,

08:27.758 --> 08:29.158
as long as we're getting looks.

08:29.191 --> 08:31.762
Check Instagram:
Everybody is doing it...

08:31.795 --> 08:33.631
No, I don't care
if everybody's doing it.

08:33.663 --> 08:36.100
Bro, this is my girl.
You understand that?

08:36.133 --> 08:37.333
- Uh-huh.
- Okay.

08:37.366 --> 08:38.668
Why is she not answering?

08:38.701 --> 08:41.638
Dude, would you relax?
She's probably just busy...

08:41.672 --> 08:43.474
having sex with other people.

08:43.506 --> 08:44.742
Oh, that shit's funny?

08:44.774 --> 08:46.109
I mean, it's pretty funny, yeah.

08:46.143 --> 08:47.778
Yo-yo, she is Barstool Sports'

08:47.811 --> 08:49.846
"Smokeshow of the Day,"
and you're dating her.

08:49.879 --> 08:51.447
And I'm constantly spotted with her.

08:51.480 --> 08:52.682
Let's just, you know, all take the win.

08:52.715 --> 08:54.484
In what world is this a "win," Vivek?

08:54.518 --> 08:55.819
His girl is out there.

08:55.851 --> 08:57.787
From the sounds of it,
she's not coming back. Hmm.

08:57.821 --> 09:00.090
No, I'm about to go find her and
make her take this trash down.

09:00.123 --> 09:01.758
No, Bro, think about it, all right?

09:01.792 --> 09:03.761
Jazz is an independent,
progressive girl.

09:03.793 --> 09:05.361
What does that have to do with anything?

09:05.394 --> 09:07.163
W-Well, Kanye would never tell Kim

09:07.196 --> 09:08.831
to delete her nudes, all right?

09:08.864 --> 09:11.467
O-Offset would never have told
Cardi B to cover up the side boob.

09:11.500 --> 09:14.037
Yo, but those dudes already knew
what they were getting into.

09:14.071 --> 09:15.873
Why am I even talking to you about this?

09:15.906 --> 09:17.840
Doug, buddy! Man, listen.

09:17.874 --> 09:19.777
Just hear me out. One more thing.

09:19.810 --> 09:22.780
Can you tell Jazz I said hi?

09:22.812 --> 09:24.347
Please?

09:24.380 --> 09:26.416
- I'm boss.
- Thank you!

09:27.651 --> 09:30.154
Peaches. Little eggplants.

09:30.186 --> 09:31.855
The drooling faces.

09:31.888 --> 09:33.824
The dregs of the Internet
are in your comments,

09:33.856 --> 09:35.792
and they just wandered through
the forest into mine.

09:35.826 --> 09:38.028
See? You style a thirst-trap picture,

09:38.061 --> 09:39.662
that's what you get.

09:39.696 --> 09:41.965
Oh. Doug keeps blowing me up.

09:41.998 --> 09:43.834
I'm-a catch you guys later, okay?

09:43.866 --> 09:44.901
- Okay.
- Later.

09:44.935 --> 09:46.670
- Bye.
- Bye.

09:46.702 --> 09:48.838
Sky, are you cool with all this?

09:48.872 --> 09:51.241
Am I happy that Smokepurpp is DM'ing me

09:51.273 --> 09:53.811
saying that he wants to do
weird stuff to my feet?

09:53.844 --> 09:56.747
No. Will I do anything for my sister?

09:56.779 --> 09:58.181
Yes.

09:58.215 --> 10:00.817
And I'll do anything for my friends.

10:00.850 --> 10:02.753
But the Internet is forever,

10:02.786 --> 10:05.756
and I just wish I could take
my name off of this mess.

10:05.788 --> 10:08.157
W-Why are you so proud of this?

10:08.191 --> 10:09.593
You've given away all the mystery.

10:09.625 --> 10:11.095
Please! I'm not naked.

10:11.128 --> 10:12.730
It's the same thing
as being in a bathing suit.

10:12.763 --> 10:16.166
Okay, but even if you was making
this same face fully clothed,

10:16.199 --> 10:18.335
I'd still have a problem
with how thirsty you look.

10:18.373 --> 10:20.061
Like, you don't see

10:20.085 --> 10:21.771
the disrespect to the both of us?

10:21.772 --> 10:24.775
Hold up.
You're liking thirsty booty pics

10:24.807 --> 10:26.576
from random chicks every day.

10:26.609 --> 10:27.878
How is that not disrespectful?

10:27.911 --> 10:29.079
It's different.

10:29.111 --> 10:31.081
They just pictures.
That's not real to me.

10:31.114 --> 10:32.850
Exactly. So are mine.

10:32.883 --> 10:34.852
Just pics. Not real.

10:34.884 --> 10:36.419
Us... we're what's real.

10:36.452 --> 10:37.855
Baby, please listen to me.

10:37.888 --> 10:39.089
No. Look, all I know is,

10:39.122 --> 10:41.859
is when I met you, you was low-key.

10:41.892 --> 10:43.093
You was cool.

10:43.125 --> 10:45.762
I-I'm not used to all of this stuff.

10:45.796 --> 10:49.767
You know, I don't like dudes
looking at my girl this way.

10:49.800 --> 10:51.368
That's not what I signed up for.

10:51.401 --> 10:53.971
Look, I'm only doing this
so that Sky and I

10:54.004 --> 10:56.206
can have better opportunities.
That's it.

10:56.239 --> 10:58.108
I'm not checking for any of these dudes

10:58.140 --> 10:59.976
or their comments unless it comes

11:00.009 --> 11:02.078
from a top-three brand that can pay me.

11:02.111 --> 11:03.913
That's it, okay?

11:03.946 --> 11:05.414
Just trust.

11:05.447 --> 11:06.917
Okay?

11:12.922 --> 11:14.357
All right.

11:17.760 --> 11:20.296
Ooh. Thank you, thank you.

11:20.330 --> 11:21.799
<i>I tried to broker the peace,</i>

11:21.831 --> 11:23.801
<i>so I convinced everyone to ignore</i>

11:23.834 --> 11:25.969
<i>the outside world for a little while.</i>

11:26.002 --> 11:27.905
<i>I know I needed a break from watching</i>

11:27.937 --> 11:30.907
<i>my professional reputation
crumble in real time.</i>

11:30.941 --> 11:32.910
Hello, my brethren.

11:32.942 --> 11:34.944
- Here.
- Oh, here, here.

11:58.201 --> 12:00.870
Okay, that sounds fun,
but we have to stop.

12:00.903 --> 12:02.505
Do you really wanna stop?

12:02.538 --> 12:03.973
Yes.

12:18.388 --> 12:20.357
- Okay, little mama. All right.
- Girl!

12:20.389 --> 12:21.792
Twins have entered the building.

12:21.825 --> 12:23.160
- Ooh!
- There they go. There they go.

12:23.192 --> 12:24.528
- Oh.
- Ooh, I want some of that.

12:24.561 --> 12:26.897
Hey. Crazy day, huh?

12:26.930 --> 12:28.866
Please don't talk to me.

12:28.898 --> 12:31.133
Cool. Yeah, cool.

12:32.335 --> 12:33.870
Hey, Luca, are you still a vegan?

12:33.903 --> 12:36.306
Are you vegan, Luca?
Luca, are you still vegan?

12:36.339 --> 12:37.975
I can't remember. It's so good.

12:38.008 --> 12:39.710
- Are you still...
- Bro. Those wings are made

12:39.743 --> 12:42.479
from genetically modified
chickens with no heads,

12:42.512 --> 12:44.414
- two hearts, and no parents.
- Mm.

12:44.446 --> 12:46.215
- I'm offended.
- Yeah.

12:46.249 --> 12:49.920
But these modified chicken
orphans are, like, so delicious.

12:49.952 --> 12:52.355
It smells so good, right?

12:52.388 --> 12:54.323
Hey, sorry to bother you.
I was just wondering

12:54.356 --> 12:55.424
if I could take a picture with you guys.

12:55.457 --> 12:57.059
- Nah, bro.
- I'm cool.

12:57.092 --> 12:59.695
- Oh, come on.
- It'll make him go away faster.

12:59.729 --> 13:00.864
For what?

13:00.897 --> 13:02.065
Hello.

13:08.138 --> 13:11.073
- Yo, what the hell?!
- What are you doing, man?

13:11.106 --> 13:12.208
- Oh!
- Oh, my...

13:12.241 --> 13:14.343
Oh, my God.

13:18.248 --> 13:19.850
Hi, guys.

13:19.883 --> 13:21.585
Looking to reinvent your look

13:21.618 --> 13:25.789
or possibly implode
your personal relationships?

13:25.821 --> 13:30.553
Well, why don't you hire the
Zoey Johnson Styling Experience?

13:34.672 --> 13:37.410
<i>So, what was intended
to be a stress-free night</i>

13:37.435 --> 13:38.949
<i>was anything but.</i>

13:38.988 --> 13:41.417
<i>Asses were grabbed, punches were thrown,</i>

13:41.451 --> 13:43.854
<i>and everybody left
feeling worse than ever.</i>

13:43.887 --> 13:45.522
<i>Especially Jazz and Doug.</i>

13:45.555 --> 13:46.989
I don't need no ice.

13:47.023 --> 13:49.026
So then tell me what you want me to do.

13:49.058 --> 13:51.160
Oh,<i> now</i> you want my opinion?

13:51.193 --> 13:53.329
This whole thing went down
because of you.

13:53.363 --> 13:55.465
Me? I didn't grab my own ass.

13:55.498 --> 13:56.800
Yeah, but you put it out there,

13:56.832 --> 13:58.267
and now I'm the one
that has to defend it, right?

13:58.301 --> 13:59.970
- This isn't about you.
- Uh-huh.

14:00.003 --> 14:02.038
This is about what's best
for me and my sister.

14:02.071 --> 14:04.975
Okay, but it's not best for <i> us.</i>

14:05.008 --> 14:07.878
What do you want to do, Doug?

14:07.911 --> 14:09.613
I don't know.

14:09.645 --> 14:11.647
I'm-a take some time to think about it.

14:16.353 --> 14:18.488
Uh-oh.

14:18.520 --> 14:20.156
Oh, God.

14:20.190 --> 14:22.893
I just feel like this is all my fault.

14:22.926 --> 14:24.762
Yeah, I get that.

14:26.363 --> 14:29.132
You do realize
it's a figure of speech, right?

14:30.667 --> 14:33.836
Look, when I was working on
my Michelle Obama showcase,

14:33.869 --> 14:36.239
my work was cool, but <i> you</i> finessed it.

14:36.273 --> 14:38.575
Yeah, but all I did
was add a few things.

14:38.608 --> 14:41.545
And it was fire, 'cause it was you.

14:41.577 --> 14:43.246
This Jazz and Sky stuff,
you're not feeling it

14:43.279 --> 14:46.249
'cause it's not you.

14:46.283 --> 14:47.917
And if you're gonna put
your name on something,

14:47.951 --> 14:51.821
it should always be something
you're feeling.

14:51.855 --> 14:53.757
Right.

14:53.789 --> 14:57.827
Well, this can't be the way
my first gig ends.

14:57.860 --> 15:00.230
So don't let it.

15:07.770 --> 15:10.239
Yo, where you been?
Did you not see Zoey's text?

15:10.273 --> 15:12.609
She wants to talk about ideas
for our next post.

15:12.642 --> 15:14.111
Yeah, I saw.

15:14.143 --> 15:15.678
Okay, so let's go.

15:15.711 --> 15:17.346
I was really thinking we could do, like,

15:17.379 --> 15:19.615
- the body paint with the Copper Calves.
- Jazz. Jazz,

15:19.648 --> 15:22.119
I gotta be real with you.

15:22.152 --> 15:25.088
I'm not feeling this, like, at all.

15:25.120 --> 15:26.756
What are you talking about?

15:26.789 --> 15:28.090
It's just...

15:28.124 --> 15:31.028
you know, last night was a lot.

15:31.061 --> 15:35.098
From the fight to those
thirsty dudes staring at us,

15:35.130 --> 15:37.967
and... you've heard Dad's voicemails.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.770
Yeah. But think about it.

15:40.803 --> 15:43.639
It'll all be worth it when
we land a real endorsement deal.

15:43.672 --> 15:45.142
I don't think so.

15:45.175 --> 15:46.944
If being a Insta-thot
is what we need to do

15:46.976 --> 15:50.146
in order to make money,
I'm not down for that.

15:50.180 --> 15:51.481
But we had a plan.

15:51.513 --> 15:53.750
<i>This</i> was never the plan.

15:56.186 --> 15:57.586
So you're just gonna bail on me now?

15:57.619 --> 15:58.956
- No.
- You're really gonna do that?

15:58.989 --> 16:01.825
I just wanna work hard and run track.

16:01.858 --> 16:03.126
- That's it.
- Okay.

16:03.158 --> 16:05.128
- I'm out.
- Cool.

16:05.161 --> 16:06.162
- Please...
- I got you.

16:06.196 --> 16:08.764
Nope, that's fine.

16:15.638 --> 16:16.974
Sorry I'm late.

16:17.007 --> 16:19.743
Um, Sky isn't gonna be joining us.

16:19.776 --> 16:22.179
It's just gonna be me doing the
photo shoots from now on, okay?

16:22.211 --> 16:25.014
- Is everything okay?
- No.

16:25.047 --> 16:27.350
It's not. But, um, whatever.

16:27.384 --> 16:28.652
It's fine. Let's just do this.

16:28.685 --> 16:30.420
No, come on. Talk to me.

16:30.452 --> 16:32.789
You always listen to me complain.

16:35.358 --> 16:39.162
Honestly, I'm just tired
of trying to defend

16:39.195 --> 16:42.299
my choices about my body
to other people.

16:42.331 --> 16:44.967
And you shouldn't have to.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.803
So then why is everybody coming at me?

16:47.836 --> 16:49.372
You know what? Look, I've actually been

16:49.406 --> 16:51.174
thinking a lot about your rebrand,

16:51.206 --> 16:53.777
and what Nomi was saying
about empowerment

16:53.810 --> 16:55.212
and owning your sexuality.

16:55.244 --> 16:57.114
And, sure, I 100% agree,

16:57.147 --> 17:00.683
but I do feel like we went
about it the wrong way.

17:00.717 --> 17:02.451
- The wrong way?
- Yeah.

17:02.484 --> 17:07.022
See? Everybody's with
this modern-feminism bullshit,

17:07.057 --> 17:09.326
and how "women have control
over our bodies,"

17:09.358 --> 17:12.494
but, like, forever, everyone's
had control over my body,

17:12.528 --> 17:13.896
from what time I wake up

17:13.930 --> 17:16.066
to how long I work out to what I eat.

17:16.098 --> 17:20.002
And now, for the first time,
I'm taking control for myself,

17:20.036 --> 17:22.204
and everyone's telling me
I'm doing it the wrong way.

17:22.238 --> 17:26.242
Sorry. That's not what I meant.

17:26.276 --> 17:29.046
Nothing you're doing is wrong.

17:29.078 --> 17:33.215
But I just feel like we could
have been more strategic,

17:33.249 --> 17:37.054
more unabashedly you
in the way that you do it,

17:37.086 --> 17:39.221
in the way that <i> we</i> do it.

17:39.255 --> 17:41.091
And I really want to help you out.

17:41.124 --> 17:43.693
But you're gonna have to trust me.

17:45.060 --> 17:47.263
Okay. I trust you.

17:47.297 --> 17:49.098
Thank you.

17:50.700 --> 17:53.103
Mnh...

17:57.406 --> 17:59.375
Damn it!

17:59.409 --> 18:00.710
Oh, no.

18:00.742 --> 18:02.178
Dude! It's almost noon.

18:02.211 --> 18:03.379
Wake up! We fell asleep.

18:05.315 --> 18:07.116
- Come on. Get up. Get up, get up!
- Okay, okay, okay.

18:07.150 --> 18:08.218
- Put your shoes on.
- I'm up.

18:08.250 --> 18:09.385
Shh, shh, shh!

18:09.419 --> 18:12.556
I'm up. I'm up. Okay? I'm up.

18:12.588 --> 18:14.191
For the record, I've never fallen asleep

18:14.223 --> 18:16.559
before satisfying a woman.

18:16.593 --> 18:18.295
- Gross.
- It's just not who I am.

18:18.327 --> 18:20.262
You know what? You might have
to sneak out the window.

18:20.296 --> 18:23.733
- We're on the fifth floor.
- But what if someone is home?

18:23.766 --> 18:26.070
Oh, you know what?
I can actually track them.

18:29.972 --> 18:31.107
Oh, thank God.

18:31.141 --> 18:33.877
We're good! They're across campus.

18:33.910 --> 18:35.778
We're good. But you still gotta go.

18:35.812 --> 18:37.247
Come on.

18:37.279 --> 18:38.981
Come on.

18:39.015 --> 18:40.784
Come on, pretty boy. Out.

18:41.816 --> 18:43.072
Please don't tell Nomi.

18:45.622 --> 18:48.092
Wooooow.

18:53.962 --> 18:56.799
Interesting.

18:56.833 --> 18:57.801
Oh.

19:01.371 --> 19:03.006
Oh, my God.

19:03.038 --> 19:05.342
- I love it!
- Yeah, so do I.

19:05.374 --> 19:06.809
All right. Now...

19:06.843 --> 19:09.813
let's post it and see
what the world thinks.

19:17.019 --> 19:20.257
<i>If there's one thing that
social media has made obvious,</i>

19:20.289 --> 19:23.159
<i>it's that sex still sells.</i>

19:23.192 --> 19:25.194
<i>And since everyone's a brand,</i>

19:25.228 --> 19:28.797
<i>finding your version of sexy
is more important than ever.</i>

19:28.830 --> 19:30.332
<i>And when you find it...</i>

19:31.800 --> 19:34.037
<i>...your new image might be a hit...</i>

19:34.069 --> 19:35.638
<i>or it might hit a nerve.</i>

19:40.410 --> 19:43.680
<i>But in the end,
what it has to be most of all</i>

19:43.712 --> 19:45.047
<i>is true to you...</i>

19:50.752 --> 19:53.222
<i>...and it has to be something
you stand behind</i>

19:53.256 --> 19:54.357
<i>and believe in.</i>

19:57.393 --> 20:01.364
Now this... this is you.

20:10.606 --> 20:12.408
'Sup?

20:12.441 --> 20:14.911
Morning.

20:14.943 --> 20:17.213
Damn it.

20:17.247 --> 20:18.914
Who ate my leftover wings?

20:18.948 --> 20:21.351
I was looking to top off
my wake-and-bake with those.

20:23.385 --> 20:26.388
Couldn't tell you.

20:26.422 --> 20:28.592
Are you sure you don't know?

20:28.624 --> 20:30.192
- Are you serious right now?
- Mm-hmm.

20:30.226 --> 20:31.928
You really think I would put
that toxic energy

20:31.961 --> 20:34.431
from processed animals into my body?

20:34.463 --> 20:36.265
<i>Ahimsa.</i>

20:36.298 --> 20:37.901
"Do no harm."

20:37.933 --> 20:40.670
Maybe you need to get right
with your Sanskrit.

20:40.702 --> 20:42.404
Cool. Yeah, I was just asking

20:42.438 --> 20:46.414
'cause you have dried
buffalo sauce in your dread.

20:47.208 --> 20:49.140
Wooooow.
