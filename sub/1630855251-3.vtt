WEBVTT

00:00.720 --> 00:02.340
[Abby] I think it's Trent Latham.

00:02.540 --> 00:04.940
[Dulcie] Five years ago,
Deadloch's Mayor, Rod Dixon,

00:05.140 --> 00:07.220
washed up dead
on the same beach as Trent Latham.

00:07.420 --> 00:09.220
His tongue was also missing.

00:09.420 --> 00:11.780
[James] Gavin Latham,
very similar to the brother.

00:11.980 --> 00:14.000
[Dulcie] The killer is still out there.

00:16.760 --> 00:19.140
We've recruited an interstate detective
to lead the case.

00:19.340 --> 00:20.540
[Dulcie] I am your partner.

00:20.740 --> 00:22.320
I don't need a new partner.

00:23.520 --> 00:24.980
[Eddie] Oi! Who's this?

00:25.180 --> 00:27.220
Sam! It's Sam O'Dwyer.

00:27.420 --> 00:30.500
Sam O'Dwyer is not here.
He shot through on Victoria years ago.

00:30.700 --> 00:32.620
- We're just making some enquiries...
- We think Sam's back.

00:32.820 --> 00:34.220
- No!
- What? Really?

00:34.420 --> 00:38.620
Yeah, nah, we reckon he's involved in
these murders that have been going on.

00:38.820 --> 00:40.860
Oi! The Cuntess.

00:41.060 --> 00:43.780
Well, that got you choking
on your Pissfiddich, didn't it?

00:43.980 --> 00:45.140
[explosion]

00:45.340 --> 00:47.480
[Dulcie] That's Sam O'Dwyer's boat.

00:49.960 --> 00:51.360
Hey! Hey!

00:53.520 --> 00:55.520
- Agh!
- [thud]

01:01.760 --> 01:04.960
[ominous choral music plays]

01:43.640 --> 01:44.760
[woman] Shit!

01:46.320 --> 01:48.980
Oh, fucking camera won't focus!

01:49.180 --> 01:51.540
- Take five, everyone!
- [feedback whines]

01:51.740 --> 01:52.860
Oh, thank God.

01:53.060 --> 01:54.100
[groaning]

01:54.300 --> 01:56.260
Ah! There's a rock up my bum!

01:56.460 --> 01:59.780
Yeah, so Dulcie's been up all night,
dragging in the burning boat.

01:59.980 --> 02:01.500
Does she think
it's connected to the murders?

02:01.700 --> 02:04.740
Ah, Aleyna thinks it was
a Norwegian funeral pyre.

02:04.940 --> 02:06.180
Performers got their dates wrong.

02:06.380 --> 02:08.540
Poor Aleyna. The whole Feastival
could be ruined because of these men.

02:08.740 --> 02:10.100
It's like they did it on purpose.

02:10.300 --> 02:11.620
The Norwegians?

02:11.820 --> 02:14.780
No, no, the Lathams!
Such shits to Aleyna.

02:14.980 --> 02:16.680
[women murmur]

02:17.920 --> 02:19.360
Someone's watching us.

02:21.960 --> 02:23.980
Oh, my God, is that Jimmy Cook?

02:24.180 --> 02:25.860
Is he wanking again?

02:26.060 --> 02:27.780
[camerawoman]
Stay in your positions, please!

02:27.980 --> 02:30.120
- This is a safe space, Jimmy!
- Nah...

02:31.960 --> 02:33.780
Jimmy!

02:33.980 --> 02:35.700
This is art!

02:35.900 --> 02:36.800
Oi!

02:38.280 --> 02:40.600
[screams]

03:04.880 --> 03:07.220
OK, M, Deadloch Pademelons.
Let's talk players.

03:07.420 --> 03:09.500
So far, the team is me, you,

03:09.700 --> 03:11.260
I reckon I could bully Adele
into joining.

03:11.460 --> 03:13.020
- [groans]
- What?

03:13.220 --> 03:15.180
What if the league doesn't let you
put in a side again?

03:15.380 --> 03:18.380
M, the only person who blocked
the Deadloch girls' team last time

03:18.580 --> 03:19.700
was Trent Latham,

03:19.900 --> 03:21.180
and he's gone, RIP.

03:21.380 --> 03:22.820
So no excuses, yeah?

03:23.020 --> 03:25.420
Tam, I've gotta get
top grades this year

03:25.620 --> 03:27.860
to even be eligible
for most uni scholarships.

03:28.060 --> 03:30.660
Plus Tom wants me to
direct a production of Hamilton.

03:30.860 --> 03:32.200
I'm going to be too busy.

03:33.200 --> 03:34.780
And also...
I can't stress this enough...

03:34.980 --> 03:36.440
I hate football!

03:37.640 --> 03:39.940
So, what, you're just gonna
abandon the team?

03:40.140 --> 03:42.060
There is no team!

03:42.260 --> 03:43.500
Yet. There is no team yet.

03:43.700 --> 03:46.220
[thudding]

03:46.420 --> 03:47.820
Shh.

03:48.020 --> 03:49.480
There's someone here.

04:00.720 --> 04:02.700
[Eddie] I'm just gonna jump
right out of here. Yeah.

04:02.900 --> 04:05.500
Just fuckin'... fuckin' leap
like a fuckin'...

04:05.700 --> 04:06.940
[shouts]

04:07.140 --> 04:08.660
- [bang]
- Oh, fuck!

04:08.860 --> 04:10.580
Oh, fuck you, tank.

04:10.780 --> 04:11.720
Hello?

04:12.720 --> 04:13.780
Oh!

04:13.980 --> 04:15.860
Oh, fuck. Finally!

04:16.060 --> 04:18.760
I was shouting out
to the fuckin' treetops.

04:20.040 --> 04:21.580
Oh, yeah.

04:21.780 --> 04:24.860
I wasn't sure how long I'd be down
here so I started a piss corner.

04:25.060 --> 04:26.560
[both exhale]

04:28.400 --> 04:31.280
Well, that just sounds like
a horrible start to the morning.

04:32.480 --> 04:35.060
Well, I'm glad you're OK.
Hey, I've really...

04:35.260 --> 04:37.640
Yeah, they have.
They've taken Jimmy to the station.

04:38.960 --> 04:41.180
No, love, I haven't eaten,
but I'm OK.

04:41.380 --> 04:43.940
I just don't really
have much of an appetite.

04:44.140 --> 04:46.580
OK, yeah, sure, bring me a bagel.

04:46.780 --> 04:48.500
OK, well I love you so much.

04:48.700 --> 04:50.100
[kisses]

04:50.300 --> 04:52.580
Lady Grey, the queen of teas.

04:52.780 --> 04:54.860
Oh, gosh, look at that.
It looks like a fatberg.

04:55.060 --> 04:57.300
- Any word from the detective?
- No, her phone's still off.

04:57.500 --> 05:00.060
[sighs] Look, the shack
is around that bend.

05:00.260 --> 05:03.260
Break in, shake her awake.
Tell her to get her backside down here.

05:03.460 --> 05:04.900
Probably just knock on the door.

05:05.100 --> 05:06.700
No, OK, let's break and enter.

05:06.900 --> 05:09.300
- I can't. I can't do that.
- Really?

05:09.500 --> 05:11.000
- Alright.
- [James] Collins!

05:12.160 --> 05:14.140
See you've met my new friend.
[chuckles]

05:14.340 --> 05:17.240
What's happened to them, James?
Are they mummified?

05:19.080 --> 05:22.800
Cute. Mummified.
No, uh, it's been saponified.

05:24.400 --> 05:25.460
Oh, what does that mean, James...

05:25.660 --> 05:27.180
Yeah, so saponification is where

05:27.380 --> 05:29.340
bacteria creates a waxy cast
of fatty tissues

05:29.540 --> 05:32.060
and it preserves bodies beautifully.

05:32.260 --> 05:34.780
This body could be 50 years old.
It could be 100 years old.

05:34.980 --> 05:36.340
It's wearing a bomber jacket, James,

05:36.540 --> 05:38.740
so I don't think it's 100 years old.

05:38.940 --> 05:40.180
How's this happened?

05:40.380 --> 05:43.340
Well, saponification
needs a moist environment to occur.

05:43.540 --> 05:46.140
So in this case I'd say... it's a lake.

05:46.340 --> 05:48.460
Great. Great.
Thanks for that insight, James.

05:48.660 --> 05:50.500
Yeah, probably got
wedged into the mud down there

05:50.700 --> 05:53.140
and then dislodged by activity.

05:53.340 --> 05:55.060
What activity?

05:55.260 --> 05:56.380
James, what activity?

05:56.580 --> 05:58.700
I don't know, a...
big fish or something.

05:58.900 --> 06:01.420
- Well, how long's it been on the bank?
- I couldn't tell you.

06:01.620 --> 06:03.100
Well, when can you tell me, James,
because it's...

06:03.300 --> 06:06.900
You know it's actually very unusual
to see saponification in cold water.

06:07.100 --> 06:08.860
Can't think of a single other case
in Tasmania.

06:09.060 --> 06:10.860
We need to get a dental ID in train.

06:11.060 --> 06:12.500
Is there any sign of strangulation?

06:12.700 --> 06:14.620
Ah, I'm not sure.
I haven't gotten to that yet.

06:14.820 --> 06:15.700
Can you check inside the mouth?

06:15.900 --> 06:16.980
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

06:17.180 --> 06:18.900
You don't handle a saponified body,
Collins, OK?

06:19.100 --> 06:20.540
- Oh...
- You have to scan it.

06:20.740 --> 06:21.820
It's too fragile.

06:22.020 --> 06:23.620
- [phone rings]
- It'll crumble like feta.

06:23.820 --> 06:25.820
Yeah, I'm not gonna touch it, James,
because I'm not a toddler...

06:26.020 --> 06:29.260
Hey, man! [laughs]

06:29.460 --> 06:30.420
Yeah, what's up?

06:30.620 --> 06:32.620
You heard the news
about my saponified?

06:32.820 --> 06:33.820
James?

06:34.020 --> 06:36.500
- James!
- Yeah, hang... Hang on, man.

06:36.700 --> 06:38.420
I need to see the lapel of the jacket.

06:38.620 --> 06:39.940
Ugh...

06:40.140 --> 06:41.740
Hey, man, yeah,
I'll call you back, alright?

06:41.940 --> 06:42.840
OK, hang on.

06:43.960 --> 06:45.480
Excuse me, please.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.660
[Eddie] Oi, Collins!

06:54.860 --> 06:55.860
Dulce, I found her!

06:56.060 --> 06:56.900
Survived.

06:57.100 --> 06:59.020
Dulce! Just there.

06:59.220 --> 07:01.740
Where have you been?
I have been calling you all night.

07:01.940 --> 07:03.500
I was bloody
chasing our prime suspect

07:03.700 --> 07:05.220
through that fuckin' haunted forest
is where I was!

07:05.420 --> 07:06.220
What?

07:06.420 --> 07:07.620
Yeah, and I fell into a bush pit.

07:07.820 --> 07:10.100
I lost him, I lost my phone,
lost one of my bloody reefs.

07:10.300 --> 07:11.700
Sorry, sorry, you were chasing who?

07:11.900 --> 07:13.820
Sam O'Dwyer. Yeah.

07:14.020 --> 07:16.660
He showed up the shack last night.
He must be hiding out over there.

07:16.860 --> 07:18.740
Look, I haven't got time for
whatever's going on around here.

07:18.940 --> 07:20.360
What is going on around here?

07:23.960 --> 07:25.620
What's that?

07:25.820 --> 07:27.360
I think it's Sam O'Dwyer.

07:41.400 --> 07:42.500
Nah.

07:42.700 --> 07:44.820
That looks nothing like Sam O'Dwyer.

07:45.020 --> 07:46.700
This looks like Tutankhamun's toe.

07:46.900 --> 07:48.740
His name's on its jacket.

07:48.940 --> 07:52.420
That's just... material.
It's immaterial material.

07:52.620 --> 07:53.940
It just... It seems extremely odd to me

07:54.140 --> 07:56.580
that as soon as we home in
on Sam O'Dwyer as a suspect,

07:56.780 --> 08:00.300
a body with his name on its jacket

08:00.500 --> 08:03.220
turns up looking like
a masticated cheese stick.

08:03.420 --> 08:05.340
Look, it probably just bobbed up
because of a super-moon.

08:05.540 --> 08:07.700
Those things can pull out
your period like a magnet.

08:07.900 --> 08:09.600
Imagine what it could do
to lake water.

08:13.640 --> 08:16.820
I just think that we need to consider
the very real possibility

08:17.020 --> 08:18.380
that this body
is connected to the other three.

08:18.580 --> 08:21.420
Mate, mate, you need to stop
trying to put shit in my column, OK?

08:21.620 --> 08:22.860
I say what goes in my column,

08:23.060 --> 08:25.300
and because you are working for me,
for my investigation,

08:25.500 --> 08:27.780
I say what goes in your column too,
which is the same as my column,

08:27.980 --> 08:30.540
but, you know, lesbian,
with fuckin' shit hair, OK?

08:30.740 --> 08:31.780
What if the tongue's cut out?

08:31.980 --> 08:34.280
And what if his arse
is filled with fairy floss?

08:35.400 --> 08:38.220
You are over-simplifying
what is happening here in Deadloch.

08:38.420 --> 08:39.940
And you are over-complicating it.

08:40.140 --> 08:42.020
I am not staying here through winter

08:42.220 --> 08:45.780
to fuckin' figure skate around whatever
crackpot theory you've hatched.

08:45.980 --> 08:48.460
I've got people
waiting for me in Darwin.
I'm King Shit up there. I'm fucking off.

08:48.660 --> 08:50.360
OK, so what's the plan, Detective, huh?
What now?

08:51.360 --> 08:53.500
Sam is out here somewhere.
We just need to find his boat.

08:53.700 --> 08:55.340
- We've found his boat.
- Well, great!

08:55.540 --> 08:58.700
Well, let's get off the fuckin'
bonny, bonny banks of Loch Deadcunt

08:58.900 --> 09:00.300
and fuckin'... raid it!

09:00.500 --> 09:02.400
We can't. Someone set it on fire.

09:04.320 --> 09:06.680
Constable Matsuda's at the wharf
assessing what's left.

09:07.640 --> 09:09.620
Abby. Abby. With the bob.

09:09.820 --> 09:11.700
Yeah, yeah, we're good.

09:11.900 --> 09:13.860
OK, well great.
That's perfect, yeah.

09:14.060 --> 09:16.660
Sam is panicking,
he knows we're closing in,

09:16.860 --> 09:20.880
and he's shedding evidence
like a snake with a secret, yeah.

09:22.440 --> 09:24.140
Wait.

09:24.340 --> 09:26.080
How did he know I was onto his boat?

09:27.400 --> 09:31.220
Which one of you cunts
is leaking like an old cow's tit, eh?

09:31.420 --> 09:32.260
Come on.

09:32.460 --> 09:33.820
I saw you all at Trent's wake
at the footy club,

09:34.020 --> 09:35.220
sinking piss with the locals.

09:35.420 --> 09:37.820
Was it you? You? Hey, you?

09:38.020 --> 09:39.860
- What about you, Sveg?
- Hmm?

09:40.060 --> 09:42.140
Did you let it slip
we were onto Sam's sloop?

09:42.340 --> 09:44.700
- I have no idea what
you're talking about.
- Did ya?

09:44.900 --> 09:46.660
Listen, however this leak occurred,

09:46.860 --> 09:49.100
we all need to be careful, OK?
This killer is...

09:49.300 --> 09:51.540
Samuel O'Dwyer.

09:51.740 --> 09:52.800
As you were.

09:53.960 --> 09:55.900
This killer is watching us.

09:56.100 --> 09:58.940
So if you have a conflict of interest,

09:59.140 --> 10:02.060
recuse yourself now before you
jeopardise the investigation.

10:02.260 --> 10:03.460
Well, what about
the dude this morning?

10:03.660 --> 10:05.220
Ah nah, nah, no, no.
He's not in our column.

10:05.420 --> 10:07.300
He's rank and irrelevant.

10:07.500 --> 10:09.180
Until the autopsy is completed,

10:09.380 --> 10:11.020
we cannot make an informed comment

10:11.220 --> 10:13.780
on whether the body at the lake
is connected to the others.

10:13.980 --> 10:16.520
Body at the lake's
connected to the others?

10:19.040 --> 10:21.380
I was looking for a leak
in the wrong fuckin' place!

10:21.580 --> 10:24.340
Turns out your wife,
Mrs Mouth-Like-A-Cocaine-Parrot

10:24.540 --> 10:26.260
- thinks she's on the fuckin' payroll!
- Keep it down!

10:26.460 --> 10:27.380
She is bringing me a bagel.

10:27.580 --> 10:28.980
She's bringing you
a conflict of interest.

10:29.180 --> 10:31.140
No, I don't have
a conflict of interest, Detective.

10:31.340 --> 10:32.940
Mate, you're fucking cooked.

10:33.140 --> 10:34.700
You cannot see the forest
for the lesbians.

10:34.900 --> 10:35.780
Oh, don't!

10:35.980 --> 10:37.140
Either you get rid of her or I will.

10:37.340 --> 10:39.660
Oh, did Cath bring bagels?

10:39.860 --> 10:41.620
Sveg, how're you going
on my flight back to Darwin?

10:41.820 --> 10:42.700
Did you get me an aisle seat?

10:42.900 --> 10:44.540
I don't want to have to climb
over a FIFO worker's chubby

10:44.740 --> 10:45.620
every time I take a piss.

10:45.820 --> 10:47.060
Yes, you've expressed that
several times.

10:47.260 --> 10:48.140
Yeah, because I mean it.

10:48.340 --> 10:50.100
Well, maybe your flight plans
have to change.

10:50.300 --> 10:51.100
Why?

10:51.300 --> 10:53.280
Because the lake body
has been identified.

10:54.240 --> 10:56.060
- Is it Sam O'Dwyer?
- It is.

10:56.260 --> 10:59.780
Forensics managed to get a print
off his little finger nubs, somehow.

10:59.980 --> 11:00.860
No. No.

11:01.060 --> 11:03.340
I was definitely
chasing Sam O'Dwyer last night.

11:03.540 --> 11:04.820
Forensics have got that wrong.

11:05.020 --> 11:07.140
Yeah, it's probably
a koala fingerprint.

11:07.340 --> 11:08.420
They're identical to humans.

11:08.620 --> 11:10.060
Lutruwita doesn't have any koalas.

11:10.260 --> 11:11.780
Why? What's your fuckin' problem
with koalas?

11:11.980 --> 11:14.020
We are not done
talking about this, Detective.

11:14.220 --> 11:18.660
This is the second prime suspect
in this investigation to turn up dead.

11:18.860 --> 11:19.900
We are missing something.

11:20.100 --> 11:21.260
We don't just need a new suspect,

11:21.460 --> 11:23.800
we need a new outlook
on the whole case.

11:28.920 --> 11:30.140
[Cath] Really hope the body at the lake

11:30.340 --> 11:31.980
isn't connected to
the two dead Lathams,

11:32.180 --> 11:34.260
'cause when we first started
talking about you working the case,

11:34.460 --> 11:35.620
there were two victims,

11:35.820 --> 11:38.100
but now there's three, that's different
to what we talked about, isn't it?

11:38.300 --> 11:39.200
Yeah.

11:40.040 --> 11:42.220
Have they been ID'd yet?

11:42.420 --> 11:44.780
Ah, no. No, not yet.

11:44.980 --> 11:47.060
When you find out,
do you want me to tell the families?

11:47.260 --> 11:48.580
You know I'm good at it.

11:48.780 --> 11:50.580
Any time I have to tell someone
their pet needs to be put down,

11:50.780 --> 11:52.180
I'm way more emotional than they are.

11:52.380 --> 11:53.460
Oh, thanks so much, love.

11:53.660 --> 11:57.460
It's just that notifying next of kin
is police's job, traditionally,

11:57.660 --> 12:00.340
and also legally.

12:00.540 --> 12:01.660
OK.

12:01.860 --> 12:03.220
You just need to be
demonstrative, sexy.

12:03.420 --> 12:04.460
This is not a big city.

12:04.660 --> 12:05.940
You are not a cop to these people,

12:06.140 --> 12:08.900
you are Dulcie, a wife, a friend.

12:09.100 --> 12:10.900
An alto in the choir.

12:11.100 --> 12:12.160
So hug them.

12:13.240 --> 12:15.220
Just hug them.

12:15.420 --> 12:16.780
Offer them comfort.

12:16.980 --> 12:19.300
Right, yep. Yeah, comfort.

12:19.500 --> 12:20.660
See youse later!

12:20.860 --> 12:23.520
Sorry my mates is in high places!

12:29.600 --> 12:31.340
You!

12:31.540 --> 12:34.940
Nah!

12:35.140 --> 12:36.420
Hey! Oi!

12:36.620 --> 12:38.880
You fuckin'... [shouts indistinctly]

12:39.960 --> 12:42.020
Where's the pecorino
I bought last week?

12:42.220 --> 12:44.460
- Ah, it got eaten.
- Why?

12:44.660 --> 12:46.940
Because it's cheese.

12:47.140 --> 12:49.980
Cath, you can't just pop in
for morning tea anymore.

12:50.180 --> 12:51.380
Oh.

12:51.580 --> 12:55.780
I'm sorry, love, it's just that the case
is getting more complicated and...

12:55.980 --> 12:59.100
there's certain things
that you just can't know.

12:59.300 --> 13:01.840
OK. If that's what you want.

13:07.560 --> 13:08.820
I mean, you don’t have to
go now, love.

13:09.020 --> 13:10.380
You've unpacked your pumpernickel.

13:10.580 --> 13:11.940
No, no, no. No, I'm fine.

13:12.140 --> 13:14.180
I'll go and see Nadiyah. Both of
our partners are too busy for us.

13:14.380 --> 13:16.000
Cath I... I'm...

13:17.160 --> 13:18.160
I'm OK.

13:19.480 --> 13:22.020
Will you still come to Skye's
Beast On The Cross dinner?

13:22.220 --> 13:24.580
'Cause if you don't want the ticket,
I'll give it to Claire.

13:24.780 --> 13:26.740
She loves offal.

13:26.940 --> 13:28.860
- [Eddie] Oi! Jimmy!
- Nah!

13:29.060 --> 13:31.620
Oh, love, I've gotta go and oversee
whatever that is.

13:31.820 --> 13:33.180
OK, remember Claire's rule.

13:33.380 --> 13:36.180
When we have conflict,
we have to kiss for six seconds.

13:36.380 --> 13:37.280
Mmm.

13:38.760 --> 13:42.220
[indistinctly] One, two, three,

13:42.420 --> 13:44.380
four, five,

13:44.580 --> 13:45.980
five and a half...

13:46.180 --> 13:49.660
Oi! Oi! Stop fuckin' running!

13:49.860 --> 13:51.220
It was you I was chasing last night,
wasn't it?

13:51.420 --> 13:53.660
- I wasn't him!
- Oh, bullshit!

13:53.860 --> 13:55.620
Your face is all banged up,
you're wearing the same clothes

13:55.820 --> 13:57.100
and you stink like piss.

13:57.300 --> 13:59.500
No, that's you that stinks like piss.

13:59.700 --> 14:01.540
- He put you up to this, didn't he?
- [man chuckles]

14:01.740 --> 14:03.020
He didn't put anything up me!

14:03.220 --> 14:05.460
Yeah, while he was burning
that dead bloke's boat.

14:05.660 --> 14:06.460
What?

14:06.660 --> 14:08.380
He sent his little rat friend
to scare me off.

14:08.580 --> 14:09.660
You're off your chops!

14:09.860 --> 14:11.460
Oh, no, I am on my chops, mate.

14:11.660 --> 14:13.920
I am riding my chops
like a fuckin' brumby!

14:15.120 --> 14:17.080
Oi, McGangus.

14:18.080 --> 14:19.780
You're not gonna scare me off, mate.

14:19.980 --> 14:22.620
I'm sticking to you
like a pube on a soap.

14:22.820 --> 14:25.620
[chuckles] Everywhere I turn,
there you are, Inspectress.

14:25.820 --> 14:26.620
Yeah.

14:26.820 --> 14:28.740
Drinking in my footy club.

14:28.940 --> 14:31.380
You're stalking me
in the middle of the night.

14:31.580 --> 14:33.140
Ordering me to eat your dick.

14:33.340 --> 14:34.460
[laughs]

14:34.660 --> 14:36.900
Hey, what's happening here?
You a bit sweet on me, are ya?

14:37.100 --> 14:38.580
- Oh, fuck up, cunt.
- [door opens]

14:38.780 --> 14:41.900
OK, well you're sending off
some pretty mixed messages, darlin'.

14:42.100 --> 14:43.980
I'd be careful if I was you.

14:44.180 --> 14:46.220
Girl on her own...

14:46.420 --> 14:47.960
in a town like this.

14:50.440 --> 14:52.100
Oi, Jimmy!

14:52.300 --> 14:55.140
Stop scratching around in the dirt
like a fuckin' chook, OK?

14:55.340 --> 14:58.220
We're going to Vic's.
You're buying me a café latte.

14:58.420 --> 15:01.460
[car doors open and close]

15:01.660 --> 15:02.720
[engine starts]

15:04.200 --> 15:05.540
I'm watching you, McGangus!

15:05.740 --> 15:08.620
Like a fuckin' chihuahua watching
a postie's tender fuckin' Achilles!

15:08.820 --> 15:10.980
You're a lesbian! Yeah!

15:11.180 --> 15:13.020
- How about that? Ah-choo!
- Detective!

15:13.220 --> 15:14.180
Fuck ya!

15:14.380 --> 15:17.420
Cath said that the shack was
filled with garbage, beer cans

15:17.620 --> 15:19.860
very niche pornography,
and a lot of copper wire.

15:20.060 --> 15:20.860
So?

15:21.060 --> 15:22.580
So, clearly Jimmy's
been squatting out there.

15:22.780 --> 15:25.820
No, Phil is the Cuntfather
of all of this.

15:26.020 --> 15:27.260
Why are you back on Phil, huh?

15:27.460 --> 15:29.880
It's a distraction. He has alibis.

15:31.560 --> 15:34.300
He is not a good man, Detective.

15:34.500 --> 15:37.220
Don't give him the opportunity
to show you that personally.

15:37.420 --> 15:38.660
Mate... [laughs]

15:38.860 --> 15:40.340
I am from Darwin, OK?

15:40.540 --> 15:43.500
Home of 24/7 thrush
and feral pigs the size of hatchbacks.

15:43.700 --> 15:48.580
I'm not scared of fuckin' Phil McGannon
from Coldfuck, Tasmania!

15:48.780 --> 15:51.260
Right, I wanna go and see
this arson job on the Loch Nessie.

15:51.460 --> 15:53.660
How burnt can a boat be?
It's in the fuckin' water.

15:53.860 --> 15:55.740
- You can drive me.
- No.

15:55.940 --> 15:56.740
What?

15:56.940 --> 15:59.120
I've actually got another job
in my column, Detective.

16:01.040 --> 16:03.640
[door opens, hinges squeal]

16:05.280 --> 16:06.580
[door closes]

16:06.780 --> 16:08.000
I will walk...

16:09.080 --> 16:10.080
...then.

16:12.840 --> 16:13.920
[Skye] Fuck!

16:15.920 --> 16:17.820
Sam was in the lake?

16:18.020 --> 16:20.620
Yeah, we think so.
I'm very sorry, Vic.

16:20.820 --> 16:23.100
- Oh, it's so dirty in there.
- Mm.

16:23.300 --> 16:27.180
I once watched a sheep
float past me, all bloated.

16:27.380 --> 16:29.260
Do you know how long
his body was in the water?

16:29.460 --> 16:31.940
Ah, maybe I should take Tom out, Skye?

16:32.140 --> 16:33.880
No, please stay, you two.

16:35.360 --> 16:37.020
So,

16:37.220 --> 16:38.860
is he in one piece?

16:39.060 --> 16:40.380
Ah, mostly.

16:40.580 --> 16:44.500
But his epidermis
is very unstable and...

16:44.700 --> 16:45.940
crumbly.

16:46.140 --> 16:48.500
You know what?
I... I am gonna take Tom out.

16:48.700 --> 16:50.940
Come on, sweetheart,
let's grab an ice-cream.

16:51.140 --> 16:53.100
I'm 17!

16:53.300 --> 16:54.480
[clears throat]

16:56.680 --> 16:58.500
So should I
make an announcement, Dulce?

16:58.700 --> 17:00.020
- Ah, no...
- Or cancel the Beast On The Cross?

17:00.220 --> 17:01.020
No.

17:01.220 --> 17:04.580
What am I going to do with the 450 kilo
of beef in my cool room?

17:04.780 --> 17:06.100
Make a fuckin' spag bol?

17:06.300 --> 17:08.540
Yeah, I just think that
until we know more,

17:08.740 --> 17:10.800
just keep this to yourselves.

17:12.560 --> 17:14.760
- Sure, mate.
- Yes, of course. Yeah.

17:15.880 --> 17:18.540
Um, Vic, you said that you thought

17:18.740 --> 17:22.540
the Loch Nessie went missing
when Sam disappeared.

17:22.740 --> 17:23.860
Is that right?

17:24.060 --> 17:26.540
Well, yes, I assumed
he took the boat with him.

17:26.740 --> 17:28.900
Ah, and is that
what you remember, Skye?

17:29.100 --> 17:32.380
I don't know, Dulce.
I wasn't in Deadloch when Dad left.

17:32.580 --> 17:34.780
I was living around the corner
from you and Cath in Sydney,

17:34.980 --> 17:36.180
doing a shit-ton of cocaine.

17:36.380 --> 17:37.180
Oh, Skye!

17:37.380 --> 17:40.460
Oh, well, I never knew, uh...
anything about that, so...

17:40.660 --> 17:42.420
- [Vic] Dulce?
- Mm.

17:42.620 --> 17:44.900
Do you think someone
might have stolen the boat?

17:45.100 --> 17:46.200
Perhaps.

17:47.280 --> 17:49.740
Could a person live
on a boat like that?

17:49.940 --> 17:51.040
Well, yes.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.980
But, well, it was a sloop, so...

17:54.180 --> 17:55.860
Yeah, it was a sloop.

17:56.060 --> 17:59.060
Yeah, a sloop, so that's a...

17:59.260 --> 18:02.280
that's an arrangement in itself,
isn't it?

18:03.280 --> 18:04.460
[clicks tongue]

18:04.660 --> 18:05.680
Mmm.

18:15.120 --> 18:19.020
[Eddie] Right guys! We need to get
everything tested, alright?

18:19.220 --> 18:21.280
Let's forensic
the fuck out of it, yeah?

18:22.560 --> 18:24.180
Phil clearly burnt it

18:24.380 --> 18:27.540
because there is something he doesn't
want us to find on it, you know?

18:27.740 --> 18:30.980
Skin, arse hair.

18:31.180 --> 18:32.700
Smack! Spoof.

18:32.900 --> 18:35.460
A mixture of smack and spoof: smoof.
We just need to find it.

18:35.660 --> 18:37.100
Here!

18:37.300 --> 18:39.860
- This bit looks alright.
- Ah, that's the mast, ma'am.

18:40.060 --> 18:43.360
Oh, right, yeah. It's probably loaded
with DNA, ready to be forensicked.

18:44.360 --> 18:47.500
You. Old salty. See anything suss?

18:47.700 --> 18:49.580
- Anyone on that boat last night?
- No.

18:49.780 --> 18:52.580
Nuh?
Oh, I can see what's happening now.

18:52.780 --> 18:55.420
Fuckin' McGangus is Mary Celesting
with that ghost ship.

18:55.620 --> 18:57.040
Motherfucker.

19:01.120 --> 19:03.080
[gasps softly] Ma'am!

19:05.960 --> 19:09.140
Because I am in the middle of
a murder investigation, James,

19:09.340 --> 19:11.900
and I actually do need to know
pretty urgently

19:12.100 --> 19:14.640
if Sam O'Dwyer's tongue
has been removed.

19:16.160 --> 19:19.580
No, this is not a favour to me,
James, this is your job.

19:19.780 --> 19:21.660
- Ma'am! Ma'am!
- Oh, good. Hung up on me.

19:21.860 --> 19:23.700
I found blood on the piece of wood
from the boat's bow!

19:23.900 --> 19:26.380
- Whose blood?
- Phil McGangus.

19:26.580 --> 19:28.700
What, and that's a confirmed match?

19:28.900 --> 19:30.300
Uh... [stammers]

19:30.500 --> 19:33.620
You know, it will be, once we
swab Phil's thin little pie hole.

19:33.820 --> 19:36.580
Where's the sticky tape
in this joint? In here?

19:36.780 --> 19:37.980
No, ma'am, that's my backpack.

19:38.180 --> 19:39.980
Yeah, that could be anyone's blood,
Detective,

19:40.180 --> 19:43.140
and the only way that you're gonna get
Phil McGangus to give you a DNA sample

19:43.340 --> 19:45.780
is by putting him under
a general anaesthetic, trust me.

19:45.980 --> 19:47.660
Why is this tampon so long?

19:47.860 --> 19:48.940
What have you got up there, a tunnel?

19:49.140 --> 19:51.940
I need cardboard! Sveg! cardboard!

19:52.140 --> 19:53.940
I think we're better off
testing the blood sample

19:54.140 --> 19:55.740
against previous offenders on file,

19:55.940 --> 19:57.380
or we...

19:57.580 --> 19:59.420
we DNA test local men,

19:59.620 --> 20:01.380
compare the results
to the blood on the hull.

20:01.580 --> 20:02.940
- The bow, ma'am.
- Yeah, the bow on the hull.

20:03.140 --> 20:04.420
- It's on the hull?
- It's a different thing.

20:04.620 --> 20:06.740
Well, I don't know boats, Abby.
What is a sloop?

20:06.940 --> 20:09.380
Sorry, you wanna blood test
everyone in town?

20:09.580 --> 20:11.460
- How many men is that?
- I'd... Oh...

20:11.660 --> 20:13.860
I mean, it's very fuckin' hard to tell
with all the puppets in this joint.

20:14.060 --> 20:18.460
Yeah, I'm in no way suggesting that we
DNA test all 900 men in town, Detective.

20:18.660 --> 20:20.860
Cut the numbers down,
we remove any male

20:21.060 --> 20:23.220
that doesn't fit the basic
statistical profile of a murderer...

20:23.420 --> 20:26.380
- [phone rings]
- ...white, cis-male aged 18 to 65.

20:26.580 --> 20:28.820
No, Aleyna, absolutely not.

20:29.020 --> 20:30.380
I think if we can
narrow down the search,

20:30.580 --> 20:32.540
then we will avoid...

20:32.740 --> 20:34.860
wildly disrupting the community,

20:35.060 --> 20:38.260
and also revealing publicly that
we are fresh out of suspects.

20:38.460 --> 20:40.180
Ah, no, we have a suspect, OK?

20:40.380 --> 20:41.540
His name's Phil McGangus,

20:41.740 --> 20:43.060
and he's going around
murdering his mates

20:43.260 --> 20:46.180
to get to the top of the pile,
like a fuckin' meerkat.

20:46.380 --> 20:48.940
Those guys are
an unexpected source of violence.

20:49.140 --> 20:50.740
We watched a documentary
about it one time.

20:50.940 --> 20:52.140
Take that, Phil.

20:52.340 --> 20:53.500
Detective, I've been thinking about

20:53.700 --> 20:55.620
how Sam's body
got onto the bank of the lake...

20:55.820 --> 20:57.620
Where are you going?

20:57.820 --> 20:58.660
None of your business.

20:58.860 --> 21:00.140
You know what?
It is my business, Detective,

21:00.340 --> 21:02.840
because we are
meant to be working together.

21:04.480 --> 21:07.480
[door opens and closes]

21:09.120 --> 21:12.940
Aleyna, I can feel you watching me
prime this wall. Just spit it out.

21:13.140 --> 21:16.380
OK, so, Fay, Skye's doing a dinner
at Carruthers Estate tomorrow night.

21:16.580 --> 21:17.900
It's, um, Beast On The Cross.

21:18.100 --> 21:19.780
Kind of like a nose-to-tail situation.

21:19.980 --> 21:22.700
Any chance you could do
the acknowledgement of country?

21:22.900 --> 21:24.700
Leaving it a bit late, aren't we?

21:24.900 --> 21:26.220
Margaret'd pay you, of course.

21:26.420 --> 21:27.980
I don't want
Margaret's money, Aleyna.

21:28.180 --> 21:31.020
I want her to give us our land back.

21:31.220 --> 21:32.520
So that's a no?

21:34.240 --> 21:36.900
So Luke Caddy is definitely
coming back here to see me play,

21:37.100 --> 21:38.260
probably in our exhibition match.

21:38.460 --> 21:40.300
- Our what?
- I reckon we should do it
at the Deadloch Oval...

21:40.500 --> 21:41.860
Yeah that's cool,
but there's no 'we' though.

21:42.060 --> 21:43.700
...because, one, the left wing,
that's my sweet spot.

21:43.900 --> 21:45.900
Two, I wanna rub Hunter's nose in it.

21:46.100 --> 21:48.260
And three, mainly I just want to
rub Hunter's nose in it.

21:48.460 --> 21:49.860
Fuck! Give it here, sis.

21:50.060 --> 21:51.080
[opens bottle]

21:52.200 --> 21:53.700
Thank you.

21:53.900 --> 21:55.100
Sorry about these. These.

21:55.300 --> 21:57.340
[Aleyna] OK, Gez,
well, we have asked the question.

21:57.540 --> 22:00.340
Oh, Miranda, has Margaret
been in contact yet?

22:00.540 --> 22:01.340
No.

22:01.540 --> 22:03.940
Why would Margaret be
contacting Miranda, Aleyna?

22:04.140 --> 22:06.060
Here, you two haven't
been at that island again, have youse?

22:06.260 --> 22:08.340
- I don't know why
she wants to talk to me.
- We haven't been Mum, I swear!

22:08.540 --> 22:10.180
[Tom] What's going on?

22:10.380 --> 22:11.820
Nothing. We'll call you later.

22:12.020 --> 22:14.060
[Miranda whispers loudly] Oh, my God,
Margaret found the earring!

22:14.260 --> 22:16.280
[Tammy] How?
How would she have found it?

22:22.080 --> 22:25.460
So Dulce, should I make enquiries
about a venue for DNA testing,

22:25.660 --> 22:26.780
just in case?

22:26.980 --> 22:28.940
I can check with Aleyna
if the Town Hall's available,

22:29.140 --> 22:32.340
but she's so anxious,
I'm worried she might... explode.

22:32.540 --> 22:34.340
Ma'am, I've also made a shortlist

22:34.540 --> 22:37.180
of 18 to 65 year old cis-gender
white men to test

22:37.380 --> 22:39.420
based on the basic murderer profile.

22:39.620 --> 22:42.260
- It takes the number down to 500.
- 500? Wow.

22:42.460 --> 22:44.780
I got the profile from
this true crime forum I'm in

22:44.980 --> 22:48.460
that's filled with ex-FBI
criminal profilers, and new mums.

22:48.660 --> 22:51.460
Anyway, my friend Jim
used to work for the FBI

22:51.660 --> 22:54.620
and he said that men kill by
shooting, stabbing and strangling

22:54.820 --> 22:56.500
and women kill by poisoning.

22:56.700 --> 22:58.700
That's right, isn't it, ma'am?

22:58.900 --> 23:02.140
Ah, yeah, that...
that tracks with my experience

23:02.340 --> 23:04.340
and also my tertiary studies

23:04.540 --> 23:06.860
which, admittedly,
predate the internet.

23:07.060 --> 23:10.500
Abby, would this Jim
be available for a phone call?

23:10.700 --> 23:13.660
No, Jim left the forum.
He had a breakdown.

23:13.860 --> 23:15.620
His wife called it 'the big one'.

23:15.820 --> 23:17.040
- Right.
- Mmm.

23:19.880 --> 23:21.700
Can I ask you both something?

23:21.900 --> 23:23.040
Yes, ma'am?

23:24.600 --> 23:26.860
Nothing. No, ignore me.

23:27.060 --> 23:29.580
Too easy.
Now, where did we land on the testing?

23:29.780 --> 23:33.580
Just leave it. Even with
a wildly reduced suspect pool,

23:33.780 --> 23:38.100
the killer's not going to hand us
his DNA in an embossed envelope.

23:38.300 --> 23:40.300
True, if you've been murdering people,

23:40.500 --> 23:42.040
you're probably gonna lay low.

23:45.280 --> 23:49.040
Actually, that is not always true.

23:51.120 --> 23:53.120
[loud rattling]

24:07.720 --> 24:09.960
[whispers] Oh! Fuck, yeah!

24:25.600 --> 24:26.600
- [grunts]
- [thud]

24:38.680 --> 24:41.440
What are all you prick-dicks
smiling about?

24:48.240 --> 24:50.480
[dog barks]

25:11.160 --> 25:12.760
[loud motor starts]

25:15.040 --> 25:16.740
[motor revs]

25:16.940 --> 25:17.960
Ted!

25:19.800 --> 25:22.320
Ted! Ted!

25:26.160 --> 25:27.420
No, Dulce!

25:27.620 --> 25:29.740
I can't get involved
in your stuff again.

25:29.940 --> 25:32.380
Phil's already barred me
from the footy club for a month...

25:32.580 --> 25:33.540
OK, OK.

25:33.740 --> 25:35.020
...because of what I done
at Trent's funeral,

25:35.220 --> 25:37.540
because of what you made me do
to Mary Avery's coffin.

25:37.740 --> 25:39.880
Ted, do you know what kind of fish
live in this lake?

25:41.200 --> 25:42.380
Carp.

25:42.580 --> 25:43.640
Just carp?

25:45.360 --> 25:48.340
Yep, they did a survey.
It's 100% carp.

25:48.540 --> 25:51.100
- OK, how big do carp grow?
- Oh...

25:51.300 --> 25:54.100
About a... a metre.

25:54.300 --> 25:56.060
Right, OK. W...

25:56.260 --> 25:57.780
And a fish that large

25:57.980 --> 25:59.540
could dislodge something pretty big

25:59.740 --> 26:01.220
from the bottom of the lake,
couldn't it?

26:01.420 --> 26:02.360
Probably.

26:03.520 --> 26:06.020
But carp don't grow that big
in Deadloch Lake.

26:06.220 --> 26:09.460
The water's munted from
all the garbage people chuck in there.

26:09.660 --> 26:11.780
There's nothin' in that water except...

26:11.980 --> 26:14.420
wheel hubs and... really crook carp.

26:14.620 --> 26:18.100
OK, so how would
something... pretty big,

26:18.300 --> 26:20.220
like... like... like a dead sheep,

26:20.420 --> 26:23.100
get from the bottom of the lake
to the bank?

26:23.300 --> 26:25.020
It wouldn't.

26:25.220 --> 26:26.920
Unless someone put it there.

26:28.560 --> 26:30.860
Ted, have you seen anyone here
recently putting things in,

26:31.060 --> 26:34.580
or taking things out of the lake?

26:34.780 --> 26:35.680
Nah.

26:36.920 --> 26:38.460
But... But, Dulce...

26:38.660 --> 26:41.220
if you're in a bit of a spot
with some dead livestock

26:41.420 --> 26:42.780
I've got a mate that
owns a pet food business...

26:42.980 --> 26:44.220
- Oh, stop talking Ted.
- And he'd really...

26:44.420 --> 26:46.840
- He could help you out...
- Yep, yep, stop talking.

27:15.520 --> 27:17.460
[chainsaw motor roars]

27:17.660 --> 27:21.500
Mate, I have been here for hours.

27:21.700 --> 27:23.060
Sveg's got me booked on
an economy flight.

27:23.260 --> 27:24.460
I need to get things moving!

27:24.660 --> 27:27.140
The whisky glass DNA is
being tested as we speak, Detective.

27:27.340 --> 27:30.460
[Dulcie] James, I can't wait any longer
for Sam O'Dwyer's CT result.

27:30.660 --> 27:32.380
I might actually combust.

27:32.580 --> 27:34.500
- Nah. No.
- What are you doing here?

27:34.700 --> 27:36.500
OK. Nuh.
Horsehair, you cannot push in.

27:36.700 --> 27:38.100
- Yes I can.
- She cannot push in.

27:38.300 --> 27:39.660
No, I can, actually, Detective,

27:39.860 --> 27:41.500
because my request
has real-world consequence, so...

27:41.700 --> 27:43.620
Oh, well, you know
what has real-world consequences?

27:43.820 --> 27:44.900
My fuckin' arse. My brown arse.

27:45.100 --> 27:47.180
Ladies, can you
stop squabbling, please!

27:47.380 --> 27:49.340
Look, I've had
a hell of a day here, OK?

27:49.540 --> 27:51.540
Hey, I'm hot property
because of this guy.

27:51.740 --> 27:54.820
Anthropologists, entomologists,
biologists, podcasters.

27:55.020 --> 27:56.420
Everyone wants a piece of me, yeah?

27:56.620 --> 27:58.020
Plus TEDxPerth.
Did I tell you about TEDxPerth?

27:58.220 --> 27:59.380
Oh, James!

27:59.580 --> 28:01.740
- Does Sam O'Dwyer have a tongue?
- I don't give a shit
about Ted and his ex!

28:01.940 --> 28:03.740
- That is all I need to know!
- Who is Ted?
- Jesus!

28:03.940 --> 28:05.660
- OK? I want the sample results.
- Alright, fine!

28:05.860 --> 28:09.140
Dulcie, here, let's all
have a look together, shall we?

28:09.340 --> 28:10.940
Unbelievable. Right, there.

28:11.140 --> 28:13.640
OK? There is your answer
to the tongue question.

28:15.600 --> 28:18.220
- Where is the answer to
the tongue question, James?
- Looks like a panda.

28:18.420 --> 28:19.460
- [laughs]
- I don't...

28:19.660 --> 28:22.060
Apols. I forgot who was talking to.

28:22.260 --> 28:25.220
Liquid fat penetrated the buccal cavity,
preserving it beautifully,

28:25.420 --> 28:29.120
and it clearly shows
a lack of a muscular grey mass.

28:30.440 --> 28:31.780
So the tongue is missing?

28:31.980 --> 28:34.360
Hey! Gold star.

28:35.360 --> 28:37.220
The tongue is missing, Detective.
They are all connected.

28:37.420 --> 28:38.460
- Could be a fuckin'...
- Detective.

28:38.660 --> 28:40.860
[James] The hyoid is crushed, too.
It's an identical break to the others.

28:41.060 --> 28:42.060
That's just a coincidence.

28:42.260 --> 28:43.620
And he marking suggests
the tongue was removed

28:43.820 --> 28:45.460
in a more aggressive fashion
than the other three,

28:45.660 --> 28:49.260
but it was still removed before
strangulation, just like the others.

28:49.460 --> 28:53.420
Ah, what do you mean
removed before he was strangled?

28:53.620 --> 28:55.340
The tongues were removed
before strangulation.

28:55.540 --> 28:57.700
It's pretty self-explanatory.
[laughs]

28:57.900 --> 29:01.180
OK? Alright, so, uh, these two
front teeth here are false...

29:01.380 --> 29:07.180
Sorry, James, how... how long
before he was strangled to death?

29:07.380 --> 29:08.680
Three hours, at least.

29:09.680 --> 29:10.900
What?

29:11.100 --> 29:12.380
Didn't I tell you that?

29:12.580 --> 29:13.380
- No, it's fine.
- No.

29:13.580 --> 29:15.580
- Everything is alright, because...
- No you didn't.

29:15.780 --> 29:18.900
Spongebob Slimedick here
is clearly just another victim

29:19.100 --> 29:21.180
of the Deadcunt Footy Club
drug ring.

29:21.380 --> 29:23.140
So we need to test his system
for drugs...

29:23.340 --> 29:24.220
Detective, come on.

29:24.420 --> 29:26.220
...and you know,
scrape every nook and cranny...

29:26.420 --> 29:27.580
- Come on!
- ...for DNA...

29:27.780 --> 29:29.500
- You are being wilfully obtuse!
- No.

29:29.700 --> 29:31.820
No, look, the footy club
is fuckin' cooked, OK?

29:32.020 --> 29:33.380
McGangus is at the centre of it.

29:33.580 --> 29:35.540
His DNA's gonna be
all over that blood sample.

29:35.740 --> 29:37.580
- Isn't that right, Smartwatch? The DNA?
- [computer chimes]

29:37.780 --> 29:39.940
Well, it's your lucky day, Detective.

29:40.140 --> 29:42.180
The results just came through and...

29:42.380 --> 29:43.580
And? And?

29:43.780 --> 29:45.260
- Oh! [exhales]
- What?

29:45.460 --> 29:46.440
They are...

29:47.560 --> 29:50.060
- Fuck!
- Detective!

29:50.260 --> 29:53.740
This investigation
has to change now.

29:53.940 --> 29:57.100
We need to completely overhaul
our approach before more people die.

29:57.300 --> 29:58.140
Yeah, you're right.

29:58.340 --> 29:59.940
Yeah, we do need
to change our approach.

30:00.140 --> 30:02.940
Let's do what you said.
DNA test these fuckos.

30:03.140 --> 30:05.420
Yeah, the footy blokes,
the old salties,

30:05.620 --> 30:07.380
those miserable looking
fuckin' blokes

30:07.580 --> 30:09.260
that look like dehydrated beef.

30:09.460 --> 30:10.260
Yeah, let's go big!

30:10.460 --> 30:12.020
Let's put a fuckin' ferret
down this snake hole.

30:12.220 --> 30:13.780
Four victims, Detective.

30:13.980 --> 30:16.380
That is a lot more than three.

30:16.580 --> 30:18.900
Conceptually, not... not numerically.

30:19.100 --> 30:21.540
All signs point to this man
being a s...

30:21.740 --> 30:22.700
No! No.

30:22.900 --> 30:27.220
All hands on deck
for the mass-DNA testing tomorrow.

30:27.420 --> 30:29.540
- Let's round up the men! Come on!
- I'm not doing that. I'm not doing it!

30:29.740 --> 30:32.820
OK, well, I am our boss, so you
will do what I tell you to do, mate.

30:33.020 --> 30:35.120
Sveg! Bring out my tickets.

30:36.120 --> 30:39.340
- Where is Sveg?
- Sveg's in bed, ma'am.

30:39.540 --> 30:43.420
Well, let's go and fuckin' wake him up
here, guys. Come on!

30:43.620 --> 30:45.580
[man chuckles]

30:45.780 --> 30:47.340
Sorry ma'am, I have to go.

30:47.540 --> 30:49.140
Sorry! Sorry, sorry.

30:49.340 --> 30:51.140
[James] Yeah, TEDxPerth.

30:51.340 --> 30:52.820
I don't know, it's like TED, but...

30:53.020 --> 30:54.820
- [engine starts]
- ...it's got the X.

30:55.020 --> 30:56.320
OK, ciao. Appreciate you.

30:58.200 --> 31:00.140
Collins!

31:00.340 --> 31:02.340
Up top.

31:02.540 --> 31:04.420
Oh, too slow!

31:04.620 --> 31:06.460
[chuckles] Collins...

31:06.660 --> 31:08.240
[phone dings]

31:38.080 --> 31:40.860
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah, I'm closing in, Bush.

31:41.060 --> 31:44.180
I am closing it in by opening it up.

31:44.380 --> 31:47.100
Should probably let the boss know
I'm gonna solve it, yeah?

31:47.300 --> 31:48.420
What do you reckon?

31:48.620 --> 31:50.340
You think I should give him a call?

31:50.540 --> 31:53.860
I'm closing up soon.
Dad's got the lights on a timer.

31:54.060 --> 31:55.740
I'll give you a tenner if you
let me stay the night, Adele.

31:55.940 --> 31:57.900
I do not want to stay
in the wank shack again.

31:58.100 --> 31:59.360
Suit yourself.

32:17.680 --> 32:19.400
[grunts and sighs]

32:23.000 --> 32:24.740

32:24.940 --> 32:26.500
- [woman] Leave a message.
- [beep]

32:26.700 --> 32:28.820
Hello, Dr Kehlmann.
This is Senior Sergeant...

32:29.020 --> 32:31.460
Uh, D... Detective Collins,
Deadloch Police.

32:31.660 --> 32:32.700
I just...

32:32.900 --> 32:36.700
I wanted to have a chat to you
about a quadruple homicide.

32:36.900 --> 32:38.140
I...

32:38.340 --> 32:40.420
I think that the killer is...

32:40.620 --> 32:41.460
Look, I just...

32:41.660 --> 32:43.660
I would love to talk this through
with somebody, with you,

32:43.860 --> 32:46.340
so if you could call me back,
that would be so great.

32:46.540 --> 32:48.300
OK. Alright. Cool beans. That...

32:48.500 --> 32:50.800
[whispers] Oh, my God, Dulcie,
that is...

32:52.040 --> 32:54.680
[inhales and exhales heavily]

32:57.800 --> 33:00.460
[man] You're listening to
Pink Flag Radio.

33:00.660 --> 33:01.740
I'm Hamish, of course,

33:01.940 --> 33:05.820
and it's time now for the Deadloch
Winter Feastival Daily Diary.

33:06.020 --> 33:09.300
We've got the Meditation
in the Fungi Forest

33:09.500 --> 33:10.580
the Electro Kukeri,

33:10.780 --> 33:13.460
and Skye O'Dwyer's
Beast On The Cross dinner.

33:13.660 --> 33:18.220
And tickets for Pinot and Potter
with Gez are now on sale.

33:18.420 --> 33:19.700
OK, moving on.

33:19.900 --> 33:22.660
If you, like me,
are a local, white, cisgendered male,

33:22.860 --> 33:26.060
head on down to the Town Hall
for DNA testing.

33:26.260 --> 33:28.500
And while you're there, check out
the Dina Tetsing retrospective...

33:28.700 --> 33:30.360
Oh, just stop. Stop!

33:31.560 --> 33:33.840
[phone buzzes]

33:36.520 --> 33:39.460
Ah, hi! Hi Danie... Dr Kehlmann.

33:39.660 --> 33:41.920
Thank you for, uh,
for calling me back.

33:43.840 --> 33:45.700
You're her bird sitter? Right.

33:45.900 --> 33:47.100
Right.

33:47.300 --> 33:48.480
How long's she away?

33:49.640 --> 33:52.120
Oh, wow. Well, good on her.

33:53.840 --> 33:56.860
Sorry, did you say she was
at a 'festival'

33:57.060 --> 33:59.660
or a 'feastival'?

33:59.860 --> 34:02.040
[crowd murmurs]

34:04.840 --> 34:07.500
If you're here for the DNA testing,
it's on your right.

34:07.700 --> 34:10.140
If you're for
the Dina Test... Testing ret...

34:10.340 --> 34:12.620
Tes... Tetsing retrospective,
that's to your left.

34:12.820 --> 34:14.340
Thanks for letting us do this, Aleyna.

34:14.540 --> 34:16.020
I didn't have a choice, did I Sven?

34:16.220 --> 34:18.780
This is a nightmare
and you lot are my paralysis demon.

34:18.980 --> 34:21.680
Enjoy! It's incredible.
You're going to love it.

34:22.960 --> 34:25.580
I stabbed my hand with a pen earlier,
hoping to wake up.

34:25.780 --> 34:27.820
Aleyna, did you know local GPs
such as yourself

34:28.020 --> 34:29.580
now offer mental health plans?

34:29.780 --> 34:32.300
Christ, what's that bearded potato
doing now?

34:32.500 --> 34:34.860
I'm here to perform
my civic duty, 'Mee'gan.

34:35.060 --> 34:36.060
'Meg'an.

34:36.260 --> 34:38.060
Hmm, unlike the elected officials
of this town

34:38.260 --> 34:40.660
I take these deaths
very, very seriously.

34:40.860 --> 34:44.380
Any worries about what these DNA
tests might uncover, Mr McGangus?

34:44.580 --> 34:47.260
The good men of Deadloch
have got nothing to hide, Megan.

34:47.460 --> 34:48.620

It's gobby swabby day!

Gobby, gobby, gobby, oi, oi, oi!

- Come on!
- Fuck me.

you say swabby ♪♪

Come on, fellas, join in with me!

35:17.880 --> 35:19.320
[Sven] Next, please.

35:24.880 --> 35:27.000
Oh, hi. Mm-hm.

35:28.280 --> 35:31.680
OK, open up for me, Mr McGangus.

35:43.020 --> 35:46.280
- [Gez] Namaste.
- Namaste, mate.

35:47.280 --> 35:50.120
Have a beautiful day.
In your own time.

35:51.520 --> 35:54.240
[Gez takes deep breath]

35:56.200 --> 35:57.780
That was great, mate.

35:57.980 --> 35:58.940
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

35:59.140 --> 36:01.420
[chuckles] Oh, there's Dulcie.
Hi Dulce!

36:01.620 --> 36:03.420
Better get going to the Town Hall.
Hi Dulce.

36:03.620 --> 36:05.260
Yeah, really well, thanks.

36:05.460 --> 36:07.700
Gez, do you have a list of
the festival attendees on there?

36:07.900 --> 36:08.860
I sure do.

36:09.060 --> 36:10.460
Is there a Dr Kehlmann on the list?

36:10.660 --> 36:13.660
Daniela. Absolutely, she is.
She's a Premium Pass Holder.

36:13.860 --> 36:16.620
Great. Great.
What... What event is she at next?

36:16.820 --> 36:18.880
Uhh...

36:22.520 --> 36:23.520
[Eddie] Next!

36:31.160 --> 36:33.340
[Sven] Hi, Abs! Hey, do you want to
take these samples to forensics

36:33.540 --> 36:34.820
so you can go and see James?

36:35.020 --> 36:37.220
- Yeah, I definitely do.
- Mm-hm.

36:37.420 --> 36:39.700
Because James is my fiancé...

36:39.900 --> 36:41.260
so, yeah.

36:41.460 --> 36:42.420
Super-duper.

36:42.620 --> 36:45.540
Hey. I just started at Deadloch High.
My name is... Ugh!

36:45.740 --> 36:47.060
I fricken know who you are.

36:47.260 --> 36:50.300
You know what Hunter calls ya?
Tommy Two-Mums.

36:50.500 --> 36:52.260
Oh, yeah. Good one.

36:52.460 --> 36:53.700
Tom, Ronnie.

36:53.900 --> 36:55.340
Dolph, what are you guys doing here?

36:55.540 --> 36:58.540
All you boys are too young to
get tested without parental consent.

36:58.740 --> 37:01.900
Callum, what is your tiny little
brother doing here?

37:02.100 --> 37:03.620
There was a flyer at the footy club.

37:03.820 --> 37:04.720
What?

37:06.520 --> 37:10.180
No, it's not all Deadloch males.
It's 18 and up only.

37:10.380 --> 37:12.760
Alright boys, move it out.
Thank you!

37:16.220 --> 37:17.200
Steve!

37:27.360 --> 37:28.500
Detective, do you have a moment?

37:28.700 --> 37:30.540
I just have a few questions
for you and Detective Redcliffe.

37:30.740 --> 37:32.340
I don't, 'Mee'gan.

37:32.540 --> 37:34.080
It's 'Meg'an. Like Eggan.

37:36.760 --> 37:39.180
[Eddie] Where the fuck's
Sergeant Horsehair?

37:39.380 --> 37:41.280
I didn't realise you had to swab
for so long.

37:43.040 --> 37:45.480
So, you going to
Beast On The Cross later?

37:47.960 --> 37:49.520
Skye's barbecuing a cow.

37:51.960 --> 37:55.000
Nose-to-tail. That's 12 courses
made from the same animal.

37:56.280 --> 37:57.500
What about the bum hole?

37:57.700 --> 37:59.700
Well, they call it something else
so people don't vomit,

37:59.900 --> 38:01.300
but, yeah, that's in there too.

38:01.500 --> 38:03.060
I've got a spare.

38:03.260 --> 38:05.460
Ticket. If you're not
doing anything tonight.

38:05.660 --> 38:07.300
No, I'm packing tonight.

38:07.500 --> 38:08.820
- What, are you leaving?
- Yeah.

38:09.020 --> 38:12.180
I'm wrapping this thing up,
heading up north tomorrow, so...

38:12.380 --> 38:14.100
Right, well, that's... that's a bummer.

38:14.300 --> 38:16.220
Not for me. Name?

38:16.420 --> 38:18.740
Ray McLintock.
We met the other night.

38:18.940 --> 38:21.420
I work at the bakery.
dropped you home.

38:21.620 --> 38:23.820
[Dulcie] No, Joan, I don't need
a ticket, I'm police.

38:24.020 --> 38:26.260
OK, well, if you change your mind
about tonight, then...

38:26.460 --> 38:28.660
What the fuck is Collins up to now?

38:28.860 --> 38:30.660
Oi! Horsehair!

38:30.860 --> 38:32.260
Where'd she fuckin' go?

38:32.460 --> 38:33.400
Hi.

38:34.800 --> 38:37.460
Oh, I don't work here.

38:37.660 --> 38:38.720
So...

38:42.800 --> 38:45.040
[ambient whalesong plays]

38:55.280 --> 38:58.100
Hello. Hi. Hi.

38:58.300 --> 38:59.420
Dr Daniela Kehlmann,

38:59.620 --> 39:02.100
I'm Detective Dulcie Collins,
Deadloch Police...

39:02.300 --> 39:04.060
- I know who you are.
- Ah.

39:04.260 --> 39:05.580
The moment
that first body showed up,

39:05.780 --> 39:07.020
I should have just left Deadloch

39:07.220 --> 39:09.100
and gone to visit my sister
in Penguin.

39:09.300 --> 39:10.940
- Oh.
- Who gave you my number?

39:11.140 --> 39:14.300
Oh, it was just
a Sydney contact of mine.

39:14.500 --> 39:16.080
I really need to talk to you.

39:23.040 --> 39:25.140
There's been
some developments in the case.

39:25.340 --> 39:26.860
We thought we had three victims...

39:27.060 --> 39:29.460
No, I'm not getting involved in this.
I'm on holiday...

39:29.660 --> 39:31.200
Now there's four.

39:36.040 --> 39:37.200
OK.

39:38.680 --> 39:39.680
Um...

39:41.880 --> 39:43.560
Killed over what time period?

39:46.320 --> 39:47.980
Five years.

39:48.180 --> 39:50.220
All murdered in the same way.

39:50.420 --> 39:52.320
I think there's a pattern here,
Dr Kehlmann.

39:55.480 --> 39:57.420
Oh, great, there you go.

39:57.620 --> 39:59.160
I can... Oh, yep.

40:02.880 --> 40:04.360
He's strangling them.

40:06.720 --> 40:09.620
[Eddie] Oi! What the period fuck
do you think you're doing?

40:09.820 --> 40:12.900
We've got 900 blokes out there
that need their tonsils tickled, now!

40:13.100 --> 40:14.100
Are you her partner?

40:14.300 --> 40:15.660
- Barely.
- No.

40:15.860 --> 40:17.900
Who are you, then?
Old mate's third?

40:18.100 --> 40:19.420
- What?
- Is this a date?

40:19.620 --> 40:21.180
- Is this a restaurant?
- No, no, no!

40:21.380 --> 40:24.380
This is...This is Dr Daniela Kehlmann.
She's a criminal profiler.

40:24.580 --> 40:26.540
We don't need a profiler!

40:26.740 --> 40:29.100
I have got a plan and I've got Sveg.

40:29.300 --> 40:32.940
He managed to track down 900 tests
from a dog DNA company at 6am.

40:33.140 --> 40:35.620
- He's a fuckin' warlock.
I don't know how he did that.
- Your testing is useless.

40:35.820 --> 40:36.660
It's useless.

40:36.860 --> 40:38.100
The killer isn't going to
serve himself up

40:38.300 --> 40:40.420
like a hippo getting
his teeth cleaned at the zoo.

40:40.620 --> 40:42.780
Well, you are lucky I don't give
a shit about what you think, mate.

40:42.980 --> 40:46.460
He's cutting their tongues out,
three hours before he kills them?

40:46.660 --> 40:48.860
He's sailing them offshore
on a sloop.

40:49.060 --> 40:50.500
It's a kind of sailing boat.

40:50.700 --> 40:53.500
- I know what a sloop is.
- So do I. I do too.

40:53.700 --> 40:55.260
I think he's sailing them
somewhere secluded

40:55.460 --> 40:56.700
and he's spending time with them

40:56.900 --> 40:59.180
and then when he's ready,
he cuts out their tongues.

40:59.380 --> 41:01.860
He's savouring it.
Where are the tongues?

41:02.060 --> 41:04.980
- I think he's keeping them.
- As trophies.

41:05.180 --> 41:06.700
No.

41:06.900 --> 41:09.180
No! It is McGangus, OK?

41:09.380 --> 41:10.580
McGangus is doing this

41:10.780 --> 41:13.260
- as part of the Deadcunt Football Club
drug ring purposes.
- Detective, just...

41:13.460 --> 41:15.620
Please just ignore
everything about her.

41:15.820 --> 41:18.540
So three of the bodies
were found on the beach.

41:18.740 --> 41:21.620
But I think, when we homed in on
an incorrect suspect,

41:21.820 --> 41:26.300
the killer placed the body of that
suspect on the shore of the lake.

41:26.500 --> 41:27.560
I see.

41:28.840 --> 41:30.620
- I think this man is a...
- No.

41:30.820 --> 41:32.920
No. You keep that rat mouth shut.
Keep it shut.

41:34.680 --> 41:36.160
He's a serial killer.

41:39.040 --> 41:40.100
No!

41:40.300 --> 41:41.660
No, no, no, OK?

41:41.860 --> 41:44.300
- This is the Deadcunt drug ring.
- [Dulcie] It's not that.

41:44.500 --> 41:46.900
And one of them blokes out there
is behind all this, OK?

41:47.100 --> 41:49.380
So congrats on your little
white-lady murder workshop,

41:49.580 --> 41:51.260
- but I've got this, alright?
- [phone rings and buzzes]

41:51.460 --> 41:53.420
- She hasn't got this.
- I have got this.

41:53.620 --> 41:54.740
Ah, Scotty.

41:54.940 --> 41:57.900
Oh, Scotty, finally, mate!
How are ya?

41:58.100 --> 42:01.340
Ah, what's that? No, nuh.
Mate, I've got good news, mate.

42:01.540 --> 42:03.420
Yeah, I'm wrapping things up
down here, mate.

42:03.620 --> 42:06.860
Hang on, hang on.
No, I've got shit reception. Wait.

42:07.060 --> 42:08.780
So, um...

42:08.980 --> 42:10.540
Great, so do you want to just
head back to the station

42:10.740 --> 42:11.660
and we can keep talking about it?

42:11.860 --> 42:13.220
No. Absolutely not.

42:13.420 --> 42:15.660
I'm not getting sucked into this.

42:15.860 --> 42:18.260
- So what do I do now?
- I don't care.

42:18.460 --> 42:20.540
I need to get ready
for the Beast On The Cross.

42:20.740 --> 42:24.020
It's 12 courses, nose-to-tail.

42:24.220 --> 42:26.600
There's wafers made of tripe.

42:31.240 --> 42:32.580
[sighs]

42:32.780 --> 42:34.580
Scott! Hey Scott, don't...

42:34.780 --> 42:37.140
Fuck. Fuck!
Don't hang up, mate!

42:37.340 --> 42:40.020
Don't hang up. I'm just trying to
get reception, mate! OK.

42:40.220 --> 42:41.540
- [horn blares]
- Scott.

42:41.740 --> 42:43.780
Fuck! Fuck me dead!
[horn continues]

42:43.980 --> 42:45.460
- Oh, no.
- Get off the road!

42:45.660 --> 42:48.140
Nuh. It's so good
to hear from you, mate.

42:48.340 --> 42:49.860
- [loud music, crowd cheers and laughs]
- Yeah! Yep.

42:50.060 --> 42:53.180
Oh, yeah, my fuckin'...
my flaps are cryogenically frozen.

42:53.380 --> 42:56.300
It's gonna take 1,000 years
to defrost 'em mate, yeah, nah.

42:56.500 --> 42:58.080
Uh, did you get my message, mate?

42:59.280 --> 43:01.820
Yeah, nah, boss,
I'm ready to come back to Darwin.

43:02.020 --> 43:04.620
I've got my plane tickets booked
and everything.

43:04.820 --> 43:05.720
What?

43:06.760 --> 43:08.180
No...

43:08.380 --> 43:10.300
Wait, wait, I don't understand.

43:10.500 --> 43:12.720
What do you mean, I can't come back?

43:14.360 --> 43:17.220
Nah, I'm over all that stuff now.

43:17.420 --> 43:19.400
Scott, don't hang up, mate.
Scott...

43:42.200 --> 43:44.600
[dramatic music plays]

43:51.240 --> 43:53.080
[laughs]

44:05.160 --> 44:06.500
I'm so glad
you could make it, sexy.

44:06.700 --> 44:07.780
Yeah, so am I.

44:07.980 --> 44:11.320
Yeah, I'm super-keen
to try the tripe wafers. Yeah.

44:12.720 --> 44:14.660
- Ray, you got me a red. Mind-reader.
- [Sven] Hi, Dulce.

44:14.860 --> 44:16.140
For Eddie, if she's with you?

44:16.340 --> 44:19.140
- Hey. No.
- Oh, no? OK.

44:19.340 --> 44:20.900
[Aleyna] Where are the fucking
hors d'oeuvres, Gez?

44:21.100 --> 44:22.500
They were supposed to be out
four minutes ago.

44:22.700 --> 44:24.760
[Gez] I'm sure they're coming,
sweetpea.

44:25.760 --> 44:27.140
Testicle?

44:27.340 --> 44:28.920
Ooh, not just yet.

44:30.600 --> 44:33.300
I'm stuck forever in fucking Deadcunt,

44:33.500 --> 44:36.080
this piece of shit fuckin' town.

44:37.080 --> 44:39.320
[murmurs angrily and indistinctly]

44:40.320 --> 44:41.600
Whisky sour.

44:52.360 --> 44:54.480
- Anything else?
- Can I start a tab?

44:58.480 --> 44:59.800
Is this seat taken?

45:01.200 --> 45:03.420
I'm Norah. Norah Jones.

45:03.620 --> 45:05.140
I'm just in town for the Feastival.

45:05.340 --> 45:06.680
Can I buy you a jug?

45:11.360 --> 45:15.040
Margaret and her husband
look fully the same.

45:17.480 --> 45:18.980
Oh, that William,
that's her brother.

45:19.180 --> 45:20.400
OK, that makes more sense.

45:21.800 --> 45:24.020
I can't see a fuckin' thing
in this fuckin' thing.

45:24.220 --> 45:25.700
[woman] Miranda Hoskins!

45:25.900 --> 45:26.880
- Oh shit!
- Oh, no.

45:28.040 --> 45:29.500
I am Margaret Carruthers,

45:29.700 --> 45:32.100
and I have a bone to pick with you,
young lady.

45:32.300 --> 45:33.500
I swear we haven't
been out there since...

45:33.700 --> 45:35.700
You didn't apply for my scholarship.

45:35.900 --> 45:36.740
What?

45:36.940 --> 45:39.220
The cut-off date was last Friday.

45:39.420 --> 45:42.580
Everyone at Deadloch High
raves about you, Miranda.

45:42.780 --> 45:44.740
Circle of Mercy has
the best academic program

45:44.940 --> 45:46.020
of any school in Hobart,

45:46.220 --> 45:48.460
so I'm sorry, I'm not gonna
give this scholarship

45:48.660 --> 45:49.740
to any other girl, darling.

45:49.940 --> 45:52.020
I insist.
You have to take my money.

45:52.220 --> 45:53.260
Are you interested?

45:53.460 --> 45:55.500
She is.
She is interested in your money.

45:55.700 --> 45:57.260
- What? No...
- Fabulous!

45:57.460 --> 45:59.420
I'll get my people to
send over some information.

45:59.620 --> 46:01.780
We can organise a school tour, hmm?

46:01.980 --> 46:05.220
Margaret. Hi, I'm Miranda's cousin,
Tammy. Fay's daughter.

46:05.420 --> 46:07.500
- Ohh!
- I'm also poor.

46:07.700 --> 46:08.820
[laughs]

46:09.020 --> 46:11.060
Ooh, I like you.

46:11.260 --> 46:13.620
How is your lovely Mum?

46:13.820 --> 46:16.300
Ah, ah, sweetheart,
I'll take that, here.

46:16.500 --> 46:18.300
Off you go. Go, boy!

46:18.500 --> 46:21.900
Miranda, darling, I will be in touch.
I love a happy ending.

46:22.100 --> 46:23.440
Onya, Margie!

46:24.960 --> 46:27.500
What? You can thank me later.

46:27.700 --> 46:29.520
Think of the money as reimbursement.

46:31.600 --> 46:33.860
[Miranda] Who wears red runners
in a portrait?

46:34.060 --> 46:36.860
[Tammy] Come on, sis,
before your cow balls get cold.

46:37.060 --> 46:39.640
[music plays,
indistinct chatter and laughter]

46:44.560 --> 46:46.140
[Cath] Ah, can I get
that wine over here?

46:46.340 --> 46:47.260
Um, yep.

46:47.460 --> 46:48.780
Oh, thanks, thanks.

46:48.980 --> 46:50.460
Thanks, whoever you are.

46:50.660 --> 46:52.340
Did you know I found the body, Ray?

46:52.540 --> 46:54.400
No I didn't, Cath. Wow.

46:55.440 --> 46:56.860
It was disgusting.

46:57.060 --> 46:59.220
It was like a forgotten old condom
under a bed.

46:59.420 --> 47:00.880
Do you want some, Dulce?

47:02.760 --> 47:04.340
So, this is what I know so far.

47:04.540 --> 47:08.420
He can strangle four large,
conscious, unrestrained men

47:08.620 --> 47:10.620
with a single piece of wire
so he's insanely strong...

47:10.820 --> 47:13.220
I'm not spending $2,000 a week
on a bird-sitter

47:13.420 --> 47:14.420
for you to pontificate...

47:14.620 --> 47:17.260
We're looking for a manual labourer,
yes? Or... Or a fisherman.

47:17.460 --> 47:18.980
Someone athletic. A footballer...

47:19.180 --> 47:21.660
- Detective, enough!
- Please, I need you.

47:21.860 --> 47:23.900
You don't need me.
You need that partner of yours.

47:24.100 --> 47:26.220
Oh, she's not even a real partner.

47:26.420 --> 47:29.780
Detective, this serial killer
isn't just surviving in Deadloch,

47:29.980 --> 47:30.980
he's thriving.

47:31.180 --> 47:33.740
He's not the slightest bit worried
about you or your partner,

47:33.940 --> 47:35.720
and right now, I can see why.

47:44.040 --> 47:46.140
[Eddie] Anyway, I've fuckin'...

47:46.340 --> 47:48.260
just about chewed
your fuckin' ear off, haven't I,

47:48.460 --> 47:49.980
all night.

47:50.180 --> 47:52.700
What's... What's your story, Norie?

47:52.900 --> 47:54.660
Nor-ray? Amore?

47:54.860 --> 47:55.980
Oh, I'm divorced and I've got a cat.

47:56.180 --> 47:58.720
It was so lovely talking to you,
Eddie, but I have to go.

48:02.160 --> 48:03.240
Just my usual.

48:04.600 --> 48:07.140
Well, well, well.

48:07.340 --> 48:10.220
Look what the cunt dragged in.

48:10.420 --> 48:11.320
[thud]

48:21.360 --> 48:22.680
You OK, sexy?

48:23.680 --> 48:24.580
Talk to me.

48:24.780 --> 48:27.500
[applause]

48:27.700 --> 48:29.720
[cheering]

48:32.480 --> 48:34.220
Thank you all for coming.

48:34.420 --> 48:36.620
Tonight is very special to me.

48:36.820 --> 48:40.140
When I was a kid, my dad Sam
used to run the pub in town.

48:40.340 --> 48:42.260
Feeding people is in my blood.

48:42.460 --> 48:45.540
I may have worked at some of
the best restaurants all over the world,

48:45.740 --> 48:48.580
but my love of food
started here in Deadloch,

48:48.780 --> 48:51.280
with him, my dad.

48:52.320 --> 48:54.240
[applause]

48:56.640 --> 49:00.500
A mate actually advised me
not to say anything about this

49:00.700 --> 49:03.260
but I need to get this off my chest.

49:03.460 --> 49:06.820
Yesterday they found Dad's body
at Deadloch Lake.

49:07.020 --> 49:09.380
- [crowd gasps and murmurs]
- Pickled like a gherkin.

49:09.580 --> 49:11.640
Oh, God, no, Skye.

49:12.640 --> 49:13.740
How long have you known this?

49:13.940 --> 49:16.900
[Skye] We thought Dad left us
years ago,

49:17.100 --> 49:19.580
so it's actually comforting
to know that...

49:19.780 --> 49:22.900
he didn't leave Mum and me,
he drowned,

49:23.100 --> 49:25.740
and he's been here this entire time

49:25.940 --> 49:27.380
at the bottom of a lake

49:27.580 --> 49:29.240
stuck in some mud.

49:31.080 --> 49:32.080
Anyway...

49:33.880 --> 49:35.160
...let's raise a glass to him.

49:36.200 --> 49:39.100
- To Sam!
- [all] Sam.

49:39.300 --> 49:40.520
Love you, big fella.

49:42.560 --> 49:45.360
[applause starts hesitantly]

49:47.680 --> 49:50.320
Uh, sorry, I have to get this.

49:56.560 --> 49:59.320
Hey, Mike, slow down. Slow...

50:01.280 --> 50:02.760
She did what?

50:09.200 --> 50:10.460
She's gone.

50:10.660 --> 50:12.220
Here's her phone.

50:12.420 --> 50:14.260
She's tanked, by the way.

50:14.460 --> 50:16.220
Her bar stool smells like
she pissed herself.

50:16.420 --> 50:18.340
- Think she did?
- Where'd she go?

50:18.540 --> 50:19.940
You're not answering my question,
Detective.

50:20.140 --> 50:21.260
Sharelle!

50:21.460 --> 50:23.420
With Phil, to his boat.

50:23.620 --> 50:26.240
They're probably hate-fucking
out on the Bass Strait by now.

50:27.480 --> 50:29.280
That dude's no fuckin' good.

50:31.480 --> 50:33.400
Not like your lot
give a rat's arse.

50:35.440 --> 50:38.220
[Eddie shouts] No!
Don't fucking touch me!

50:38.420 --> 50:40.740
- Get your fuckin' hands off me!
- [McGangus] What the fuck!

50:40.940 --> 50:43.060
- You...
- [Eddie] I didn't fuckin' touch ya!

50:43.260 --> 50:45.380
Fuckin' slipped on the fish guts,
you fuckin' cunt!

50:45.580 --> 50:47.220
[McGangus] Ugh...

50:47.420 --> 50:49.260
Back down, Phil. Where is she?

50:49.460 --> 50:53.020
That mad bitch whacked me, and now
she's trying to flog my fuckin' boat!

50:53.220 --> 50:54.940
Yeah, why'd you take her
onto your boat, Phil, huh?

50:55.140 --> 50:56.900
What exactly was your intention?

50:57.100 --> 50:58.620
She's in no state.

50:58.820 --> 51:00.980
You wait till I tell Shane Hastings
about this.

51:01.180 --> 51:01.980
Hey, hey?

51:02.180 --> 51:05.180
He'll have you titted clowns
out on your arse!

51:05.380 --> 51:08.660
I'm coming, bushy mate! I'm never
gonna fuckin' let you go, mate!

51:08.860 --> 51:11.100
I'm comin' to get ya!

51:11.300 --> 51:12.420
See ya, Deadcunt!

51:12.620 --> 51:16.460
Ya fuckin' piss-hole eyesore
of a fuckin' shithole town.

51:16.660 --> 51:17.700
What are you doing?

51:17.900 --> 51:19.380
I'm going to Cuba!

51:19.580 --> 51:22.660
Going to Cuba
to drink mojitos in the sun.

51:22.860 --> 51:26.000
You know you're
not even moving, Detective?

51:28.000 --> 51:29.420
- Fuck!
- Get off the boat.

51:29.620 --> 51:30.580
- No.
- Get off the boat!

51:30.780 --> 51:32.340
- No!
- Don't you make me
come on there, Detective.

51:32.540 --> 51:33.820
- Get off the boat!
- No.

51:34.020 --> 51:36.780
Right, I'm coming on.
I am coming on the boat.

51:36.980 --> 51:38.660
The fuckin'... What the fuck...?

51:38.860 --> 51:40.660
- Right, get off the boat.
- No.

51:40.860 --> 51:41.780
- Get off the boat.
- No.

51:41.980 --> 51:43.380
- Get off!
- No!

51:43.580 --> 51:46.900
You... Why is it so slippery?!

51:47.100 --> 51:49.140
- You get back! Get back here.
- No!

51:49.340 --> 51:50.920
Get... Oww!

51:52.200 --> 51:53.140
[screams]

51:53.340 --> 51:54.540
- Get back here now!
- No.

51:54.740 --> 51:55.940
- Get back here!
- No I'm not!

51:56.140 --> 51:56.940
Stop it!

51:57.140 --> 51:58.580
[screams]

51:58.780 --> 52:00.020
I'm a deadweight!

52:00.220 --> 52:01.420
Use... Can you use your legs?!

52:01.620 --> 52:02.980
I'm a deadweight. I can't move.

52:03.180 --> 52:05.220
[both] Agh!

52:05.420 --> 52:08.240
[both shout indistinctly]

52:14.160 --> 52:15.060
Get off!

52:15.260 --> 52:17.700
No, get your hands off my bum,
ya fuckin' sleaze!

52:17.900 --> 52:19.180
Oh, God!

52:19.380 --> 52:20.900
- Oh God!
- I'm bleeding!

52:21.100 --> 52:23.100
Ya fuckin'... ripped off my toenail!

52:23.300 --> 52:24.900
That was so unpleasant!

52:25.100 --> 52:27.040
[both breathe heavily]

52:29.560 --> 52:31.220
Why were you talking to the press?

52:31.420 --> 52:32.340
What?

52:32.540 --> 52:33.540
Here you are,

52:33.740 --> 52:35.620
you are accusing my team,

52:35.820 --> 52:37.500
my wife of leaking,

52:37.700 --> 52:41.820
and you're off at the pub,
getting drunk with a journo.

52:42.020 --> 52:43.660
- No, that is not what happened.
- Actually, don't talk.

52:43.860 --> 52:46.520
Just shoosh it! Shoosh it all.

52:47.600 --> 52:52.460
You have just burped and urinated
your way around this town

52:52.660 --> 52:55.620
with your filthy feet
and your half-pants...

52:55.820 --> 52:57.740
- They're three-quarter.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

52:57.940 --> 53:00.380
[imitates Eddie's accent]
G'day, g'day! I'm Eddie Redcliffe.

53:00.580 --> 53:01.940
Oh, yeah, nah, yeah,

53:02.140 --> 53:04.180
it's all the Deadloch c-word
Football Club drug ring.

53:04.380 --> 53:06.820
Yeah, I'm a... I'm a potty-mouth cowboy.

53:07.020 --> 53:09.940
I'm... I'm King effin' Shit
up in Darwin.

53:10.140 --> 53:11.400
But are you?

53:12.480 --> 53:14.060
Because as far as I can see,

53:14.260 --> 53:15.860
all you have done

53:16.060 --> 53:19.060
is look for the quickest, easiest,
most off-tap way to solve this case

53:19.260 --> 53:20.600
so you can leave.

53:21.800 --> 53:24.140
So do you want to leave?
Is that what you want?

53:24.340 --> 53:25.140
Yes!

53:25.340 --> 53:27.180
- Yes?
- Yes, it is what I fuckin' want.

53:27.380 --> 53:28.780
- OK, then, let's go!
- I can't!

53:28.980 --> 53:30.500
Let's get your bag of undies

53:30.700 --> 53:32.660
and put you on a plane
back to Darwin.

53:32.860 --> 53:33.900
I can't!

53:34.100 --> 53:35.620
- They don't want me either!
- Why not?

53:35.820 --> 53:38.080
Because I...
I fuckin' killed my partner!

53:39.520 --> 53:40.640
OK?

53:42.280 --> 53:43.680
You what?

53:45.360 --> 53:46.560
Bushy.

53:48.200 --> 53:50.640
He was my best mate.
We were...

53:51.640 --> 53:53.360
...a fuckin' team and...

53:54.800 --> 53:57.080
...he got eaten by a croc and...

53:58.280 --> 54:00.300
...I fuckin'...

54:00.500 --> 54:01.740
was s'posed to be with him
when it happened

54:01.940 --> 54:03.540
but I was... but I was...

54:03.740 --> 54:05.960
I was pissing on at the pub.

54:07.960 --> 54:10.660
And they all blame me for it,
you know?

54:10.860 --> 54:11.880
My mates.

54:12.880 --> 54:14.800
Bushy's wife, Holly.

54:16.200 --> 54:18.620
And I thought
if I came down here and I...

54:18.820 --> 54:21.620
I solved this case,
then maybe they'd see I'm alright.

54:21.820 --> 54:22.720
But...

54:25.120 --> 54:26.100
Th...

54:26.300 --> 54:27.860
They're right.

54:28.060 --> 54:29.240
I'm a fuck-up.

54:30.240 --> 54:32.640
I'm a fuck... I'm a fuck-up.
[sniffles]

54:35.760 --> 54:37.200
Look, I'm genuinely...

54:38.480 --> 54:40.840
...very sorry about your partner.

54:43.400 --> 54:45.620
I'm also deeply sorry that I...

54:45.820 --> 54:47.300
did that impersonation of you,
that was not OK.

54:47.500 --> 54:48.620
Yeah, that was terrible.

54:48.820 --> 54:50.140
- It was terrible.
- You know, it was really...

54:50.340 --> 54:51.900
- I agree.
- Talk about kicking a girl
when she's down.

54:52.100 --> 54:53.400
Yep, I understand.

55:00.280 --> 55:01.660
What are you doing?
Are you trying to kiss me?

55:01.860 --> 55:03.540
No, I'm offering you comfort!
I'm not trying to kiss you.

55:03.740 --> 55:05.940
- Trying to take advantage of me...
- Why do you have to ruin it? God!

55:06.140 --> 55:08.220
- Why do you have to
try and make everything...
- I'm not. Just stop.

55:08.420 --> 55:09.720
- ...lesbian?
- Stop!

55:14.920 --> 55:17.240
Look, I... [sighs]

55:19.560 --> 55:21.380
Deadloch has a serial killer.

55:21.580 --> 55:22.980
No, no, no...

55:23.180 --> 55:25.020
No, he is a serial killer,
and you deny it again,

55:25.220 --> 55:27.200
I will dunk you in that ocean
like a biscuit.

55:29.600 --> 55:31.620
This man...

55:31.820 --> 55:34.020
he has been living under my nose
in Deadloch for five years.

55:34.220 --> 55:36.140
I probably know him. I... I...

55:36.340 --> 55:40.200
I've probably borrowed the same
books as him from the library.

55:41.880 --> 55:44.240
I need an outsider's perspective.

55:45.840 --> 55:47.440
I need a partner.

55:48.880 --> 55:49.820
[Abby] Ma'ams!

55:50.020 --> 55:52.060
Ma'ams! Ma'ams!

55:52.260 --> 55:56.420
Oh, gosh.
Oh, that was like running in a dream.

55:56.620 --> 55:57.940
I've just come back from the lab.

55:58.140 --> 55:59.900
I was dropping off
the DNA test results.

56:00.100 --> 56:02.700
Was there a match to the blood
from the burnt sloop?

56:02.900 --> 56:05.780
No, there wasn't a match to any of
our victims, or the DNA samples.

56:05.980 --> 56:09.780
But I was thinking, the killer's
killing the men on his sloop, right?

56:09.980 --> 56:11.980
And I was wondering how he
gets these big men onto the boat?

56:12.180 --> 56:14.980
Because the wharf is really high,
but the sloop is really low.

56:15.180 --> 56:16.900
It is low! It is so low!

56:17.100 --> 56:19.380
Exactly, so I was thinking
even if it was possible,

56:19.580 --> 56:21.500
the victims would have
put up a fight, right?

56:21.700 --> 56:23.780
Which means they'd totally have,
like, defensive wounds.

56:23.980 --> 56:25.860
But none of the victims had any.

56:26.060 --> 56:27.460
So I thought maybe

56:27.660 --> 56:30.500
the victims were relaxed
when they were taken onto the boat.

56:30.700 --> 56:33.380
So Sam O'Dwyer's tox report
hasn't come back yet,

56:33.580 --> 56:35.420
but I went back and I checked
the other victims' tox report,

56:35.620 --> 56:38.540
and, obviously, Trent and Gavin
had drugs present in their systems,

56:38.740 --> 56:42.020
but Rod Dixon also had drugs
present in his system,

56:42.220 --> 56:43.500
which I thought was a bit weird,

56:43.700 --> 56:46.300
because he's, like, the Mayor,
and, like, a respectable guy and stuff.

56:46.500 --> 56:48.500
Anyway, I checked
the new toxicology reports...

56:48.700 --> 56:50.980
- There's a new toxicology report?
- Mm-hm.

56:51.180 --> 56:54.580
So these ones show the level
of drugs, not just the presence.

56:54.780 --> 56:56.100
Did you order, these Constable?

56:56.300 --> 56:57.860
No, ma'am, Detective Redcliffe did.

56:58.060 --> 57:01.060
Because of her Deadcunt
Football Club drug ring theory.

57:01.260 --> 57:04.300
Oh, fuck, I've lost another toenail!

57:04.500 --> 57:07.200
- Are these levels high?
- Very high, ma'am.

57:08.880 --> 57:13.420
Trent, Gavin and Rod
had pentobarbital in their systems.

57:13.620 --> 57:16.540
Wait, what's, um, pentofar... farbital?

57:16.740 --> 57:18.040
[Dulcie] It's a tranquiliser.

57:19.560 --> 57:21.780
Men don't poison.

57:21.980 --> 57:22.880
[Eddie] What?

57:24.160 --> 57:26.600
Men don't poison, Detective.

57:28.120 --> 57:29.980
We're looking for a woman.

57:30.180 --> 57:31.480
Mmm!

57:36.760 --> 57:38.460
OK. OK.

57:38.660 --> 57:39.460
[grunts]

57:39.660 --> 57:41.580
No, I got it.
Here's what we're gonna do.

57:41.780 --> 57:43.260
- I'm gonna get two fizzy aspirin.
- [Abby] Mm-hm.

57:43.460 --> 57:46.060
We're gonna have a fuckin' tube
of the fuckin' tablets

57:46.260 --> 57:48.140
that, you know,
make your piss go fluoro

57:48.340 --> 57:50.300
and then you're gonna stick 'em
in a two-litre bottle of cola

57:50.500 --> 57:52.860
and I'm gonna neck the shit out
of that.

57:53.060 --> 57:55.100
OK, ma'am. Um, why?

57:55.300 --> 58:00.500
'Cause this one is up shit street
without, fuckin', a map.

58:00.700 --> 58:02.880
She's gonna need
all the help she can get.

58:07.160 --> 58:08.600
Let's go, Detective.
