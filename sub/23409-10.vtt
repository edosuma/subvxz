WEBVTT

00:00.327 --> 00:02.228
Previously on Burden of Truth...

00:02.263 --> 00:04.324
Southvale Farms, you gotta go back.

00:04.349 --> 00:05.450
Take a closer look.

00:05.475 --> 00:06.704
I'd like to depose you.

00:06.729 --> 00:08.019
Have you sign an affidavit

00:08.044 --> 00:09.283
so that we can use it in court.

00:09.307 --> 00:10.664
You want me to go on the record?

00:10.689 --> 00:12.042
I came here to let you know

00:12.067 --> 00:14.052
that Luna and I are fine.

00:14.109 --> 00:16.416
- I think that's good.
- He's told so many lies.

00:16.441 --> 00:18.169
I just need to find the one

00:18.194 --> 00:19.429
that will trip him up.

00:19.475 --> 00:21.162
- Ask your mother.
- Yeah, I haven't heard from her

00:21.186 --> 00:22.210
in over a decade.

00:22.235 --> 00:23.408
I just need to ask you a few questions

00:23.432 --> 00:24.967
about the purchase of Matheson Steel.

00:24.992 --> 00:26.354
It's for an important
case we're working on.

00:26.378 --> 00:28.200
There's something in
here you need to see.

00:28.225 --> 00:29.805
This is from Alison Shepperd.

00:29.830 --> 00:32.296
Derek's been offered a job in Winnipeg.

00:32.583 --> 00:33.925
It looks like I might be moving.

00:33.950 --> 00:35.279
You might actually have a case

00:35.304 --> 00:36.557
against Matheson Steel,

00:36.582 --> 00:38.323
but you don't have a
case against P and L.

00:38.407 --> 00:40.970
- Someone poisoned me.
- Sweetheart, I would never hurt you.

00:40.995 --> 00:42.506
We're filing a motion

00:42.531 --> 00:46.023
for a summary judgment
on your claims against P and L.

00:46.087 --> 00:48.493
If you don't have a case
against the parent company,

00:48.520 --> 00:50.587
then we're done.

00:57.193 --> 00:59.194
Look who's back on the job.

01:00.332 --> 01:03.198
- How's the head?
- Good as new.

01:03.485 --> 01:05.834
Did it have anything
to do with our case?

01:06.500 --> 01:09.137
It was time for me
to pick a side anyway.

01:10.550 --> 01:12.244
So, what can I do for you?

01:14.196 --> 01:16.430
How does somebody
just abandon their kid?

01:18.360 --> 01:20.174
David Hanley.

01:21.498 --> 01:25.598
It takes more than biology
to make a dad.

01:26.920 --> 01:28.823
Now, I'm speaking from experience.

01:29.237 --> 01:31.192
I didn't grow up
with my bio dad either.

01:32.074 --> 01:33.653
At least you had a stepdad.

01:33.696 --> 01:36.384
Hey, what am I? Come on.

01:36.492 --> 01:38.245
Just because me and your
mom didn't work out,

01:38.269 --> 01:39.794
doesn't mean that...

01:40.121 --> 01:41.269
What?

01:42.909 --> 01:44.506
You've grown on me, String Bean.

01:44.877 --> 01:47.494
- I have?
- Yeah. Like a fungus.

01:47.519 --> 01:49.587
Shut up!

01:53.836 --> 01:56.037
You are the best dad I never had.

01:56.718 --> 01:58.552
I'll take that.

02:00.957 --> 02:02.110
So...

02:02.184 --> 02:04.689
is it true that Ms. Evans is leaving?

02:04.962 --> 02:08.342
That's what I heard.
It's a loss for the school.

02:08.612 --> 02:09.711
Come on.

02:09.771 --> 02:11.925
The town's small and I'm not an idiot.

02:12.795 --> 02:13.917
Of course I know.

02:14.002 --> 02:15.577
Yeah, no relationship advice from kids,

02:15.602 --> 02:17.161
thank you very much.

02:17.336 --> 02:18.629
I am 18!

02:21.864 --> 02:23.297
I gotta go.

02:25.000 --> 02:31.074

02:33.783 --> 02:35.236
Luna.

02:36.269 --> 02:38.426
You have to face him.

02:38.989 --> 02:41.095
Even if it hurts.

02:56.792 --> 02:59.079
No power. No heat.

02:59.234 --> 03:01.135
I'll handle it.

03:02.069 --> 03:03.785
It must just be a mixup.

03:03.895 --> 03:05.555
They don't usually cut off the services

03:05.580 --> 03:07.881
'til after your third warning.

03:09.618 --> 03:11.078
I haven't been entirely honest with you

03:11.102 --> 03:12.334
about our finances.

03:12.361 --> 03:15.561
I know. They're messing with us.

03:15.664 --> 03:17.381
You think CTS did this?

03:17.406 --> 03:20.468
I used to... call in fake gas leaks.

03:20.886 --> 03:22.381
It's all about disruption.

03:22.406 --> 03:23.767
Well, they set out to bankrupt us,

03:23.792 --> 03:25.841
and they're doing a pretty good job.

03:25.866 --> 03:26.971
Good news is

03:27.056 --> 03:29.524
I won 25 bucks playing the lottery.

03:31.400 --> 03:33.751
They're keeping us busy
fighting motions.

03:34.444 --> 03:36.851
There is always the letter
from Mayor Shepperd.

03:37.895 --> 03:39.473
I don't wanna go there.

03:45.594 --> 03:47.795
Wow.

03:48.215 --> 03:49.370
Back in the day,

03:49.395 --> 03:51.196
this was the old five and dime.

03:51.872 --> 03:54.469
I never saw it as a lawyer's office.

03:55.389 --> 03:56.599
But it's nice.

03:56.679 --> 03:58.610
You know, it's... humble.

03:58.646 --> 04:00.671
- What do you want?
- Come on, you must have known

04:00.696 --> 04:02.397
I was going to file
for summary judgment.

04:02.464 --> 04:04.060
Another obvious procedural hurdle,

04:04.085 --> 04:05.257
one that's beneath you.

04:08.350 --> 04:09.771
You won't win your case

04:09.796 --> 04:12.153
against P and L, but we've

04:12.953 --> 04:15.056
prepared to make you an offer.

04:15.495 --> 04:17.711
The girls split one million,
paid out over five years.

04:17.752 --> 04:19.454
- No way.
- Ben will keep his promise

04:19.480 --> 04:20.511
to clean up the field,

04:20.536 --> 04:22.333
and the girls will get cash to help

04:22.358 --> 04:24.009
cover their medical bills.

04:24.188 --> 04:26.917
Of course, we'll require
full confidentiality.

04:27.663 --> 04:28.674
Joanna,

04:28.706 --> 04:30.118
you're sitting in the dark.

04:30.143 --> 04:32.178
How can you possibly survive a trial?

04:32.203 --> 04:33.482
This is a gift.

04:34.138 --> 04:35.458
Take it.

04:35.957 --> 04:37.888
We do not accept it.

04:42.999 --> 04:44.866
The girls won't get
a better offer than this.

04:45.099 --> 04:47.468
You need to do
the right thing for them.

04:47.897 --> 04:50.573
We'll present it to our
clients and get back to you.

05:13.702 --> 05:15.635
I was thinking
about all the extra hours

05:15.660 --> 05:18.501
I spent working,
trying to save up for this car.

05:19.408 --> 05:21.122
All the plans we had for it.

05:21.442 --> 05:22.738
Get out of Millwood.

05:23.385 --> 05:26.320
- Go to school.
- See the world.

05:29.350 --> 05:31.318
I'd start with an ocean.

05:31.990 --> 05:34.302
18 years and I've never seen an ocean.

05:34.435 --> 05:35.669
You don't need to sell the car.

05:35.693 --> 05:37.056
I need the money.

05:37.081 --> 05:39.596
The Mill filed the motion
to end the case.

05:39.688 --> 05:41.221
It could be over, right?

05:41.644 --> 05:44.617
If we don't get a settlement,
then the money

05:44.642 --> 05:46.579
from this car is all I've got.

05:46.702 --> 05:47.962
I have to accept the fact

05:47.987 --> 05:51.843
that my future is... right here.

05:52.036 --> 05:53.714
You're gonna study sports medicine.

05:53.774 --> 05:55.366
We need to accept that I'm not.

05:55.463 --> 05:58.332
What about the clinical trial
for brain injuries?

05:58.810 --> 06:00.525
Molls, it seems promising.

06:00.550 --> 06:03.586
The doctors are in Winnipeg.
You're in Montreal.

06:03.732 --> 06:06.495
- Then I'll transfer.
- You're not giving up Montreal!

06:12.200 --> 06:13.635
It's Billy.

06:13.702 --> 06:15.904
There's an offer.

06:16.987 --> 06:18.680
I have good news, Taylor.

06:20.244 --> 06:22.350
P and L is making an offer to settle.

06:23.443 --> 06:25.887
That's good. Your friends
will get some money.

06:25.974 --> 06:28.542
- How much?
- More than they'd get at trial.

06:31.448 --> 06:34.658
The thing is, Crawford is gonna
try to drag this out

06:34.683 --> 06:36.617
as long as possible.

06:37.389 --> 06:38.873
Yeah.

06:39.175 --> 06:40.954
I think it's just best for all of us

06:40.979 --> 06:42.084
if we put it behind us.

06:42.109 --> 06:43.363
I'm not a part of the...

06:43.402 --> 06:45.483
I'm not a part of the suit anymore.

06:46.023 --> 06:47.575
I know, honey.

06:47.668 --> 06:49.603
But the other girls trust you.

06:51.160 --> 06:52.960
Hey, they do.

06:53.528 --> 06:55.929
They know you've been
put in a difficult position.

06:56.810 --> 06:58.319
And they know that you're smart

06:58.780 --> 07:00.321
and honest.

07:00.940 --> 07:02.356
So do I.

07:10.505 --> 07:12.032
If you tell them to take the offer,

07:12.057 --> 07:14.239
they'll take that seriously.

07:18.641 --> 07:20.664
OK. I'll talk to them.

07:21.433 --> 07:22.799
That's my girl.

07:22.848 --> 07:25.826
If you apologize to the girls
and their families.

07:27.366 --> 07:28.486
Dad...

07:28.511 --> 07:30.846
they just want someone
to take responsibility.

07:32.768 --> 07:34.893
Taylor, if it wasn't for me,

07:34.969 --> 07:36.257
the Mill would've closed.

07:36.282 --> 07:38.162
There would be no Millwood.

07:39.083 --> 07:40.597
Those are my terms.

07:40.661 --> 07:43.263
Apologize, and then
I'll talk to the girls.

07:49.717 --> 07:51.171
Time to decide.

07:51.226 --> 07:53.027
Now, we can do this by secret ballot.

07:53.142 --> 07:55.109
We should know where everyone stands.

07:57.038 --> 07:58.324
OK.

07:59.258 --> 08:01.849
Well, obviously it isn't
an ideal offer,

08:02.717 --> 08:04.118
but it's something.

08:04.668 --> 08:06.420
And it's your offer...

08:07.874 --> 08:09.491
so it's up to you.

08:10.939 --> 08:14.007
Who votes yes to accept the offer?

08:16.431 --> 08:18.121
You guys, we could end up with nothing.

08:18.146 --> 08:19.466
We're getting almost nothing.

08:19.491 --> 08:22.154
- What's the difference?
- The difference is getting out of here!

08:22.210 --> 08:24.407
You're not the only one who
wants to get out of Millwood, Molly,

08:24.431 --> 08:26.799
and that offer is not
gonna take you very far.

08:27.309 --> 08:30.129
- So, majority rules?
- Three to one.

08:30.472 --> 08:33.841
OK. We move forward.

08:56.088 --> 08:57.922
Can I help you?

08:58.182 --> 09:00.517
I know you're my dad.

09:04.637 --> 09:07.452
You have been misinformed, young lady.

09:07.804 --> 09:09.988
DNA says otherwise.

09:10.141 --> 09:11.219
Let me guess.

09:11.244 --> 09:13.345
You tested your DNA with my daughter's?

09:13.865 --> 09:15.675
Sibling DNA tests are inconclusive.

09:15.700 --> 09:16.724
It proves nothing.

09:16.749 --> 09:17.992
Why are you here?

09:18.171 --> 09:19.577
What do you want from me?

09:20.082 --> 09:21.497
What do you want?

09:21.727 --> 09:24.696
- How about acknowledgement?
- It's a lie.

09:24.783 --> 09:26.244
Your family is using you.

09:26.269 --> 09:28.066
They're playing on your emotions.

09:28.341 --> 09:30.709
Joanna's my sister. I know it.

09:30.803 --> 09:32.384
Somebody knocked your mom up, kid,

09:32.409 --> 09:34.183
but it sure as hell wasn't me.

09:52.212 --> 09:53.832
I hate him.

09:54.633 --> 09:56.465
I know you do, baby.

09:56.550 --> 09:58.587
Welcome to the club.

10:00.293 --> 10:03.328
- Why doesn't he want me, Mom?
- Hey...

10:04.236 --> 10:06.237
He doesn't deserve you.

10:07.981 --> 10:10.249
I wish Owen were my dad.

10:11.457 --> 10:12.901
I know.

10:14.467 --> 10:16.060
I'm sorry.

10:30.310 --> 10:33.045
- Dad?
- Taylor.

10:33.312 --> 10:35.479
Dad, it's just me.

10:35.694 --> 10:37.878
There's no courts
and there's no lawyers.

10:37.970 --> 10:39.579
I'll never say anything.

10:39.665 --> 10:41.266
I'll forgive you

10:41.561 --> 10:44.636
if you just tell me
the truth just once.

10:45.070 --> 10:46.319
Taylor...

10:46.351 --> 10:49.133
You always wanted me
to go off and study.

10:49.204 --> 10:50.689
Come back, and...

10:51.552 --> 10:52.912
take over the Mill.

10:53.793 --> 10:55.627
I just did chemo, Dad,

10:55.695 --> 10:57.399
because of Matheson Steel.

10:57.474 --> 11:00.144
No. My Uncle Walter had leukemia.

11:00.734 --> 11:03.302
It runs in the family.

11:05.041 --> 11:06.361
I'm coming to court.

11:06.458 --> 11:08.788
- Taylor, that's not a good idea.
- I'm between treatments, Dad.

11:08.812 --> 11:10.933
The doctors are saying
that you need your rest.

11:11.038 --> 11:12.401
I feel great.

11:13.320 --> 11:14.792
And I need to be there.

11:16.636 --> 11:18.324
And I can't go with you.

11:21.440 --> 11:22.885
Taylor...

11:36.168 --> 11:38.036
You asked about your dad?

11:41.348 --> 11:43.941
This should tell you
everything you need to know.

11:46.592 --> 11:48.426
Do the math.

11:51.049 --> 11:52.821
You can use it.

12:04.897 --> 12:07.899
After Matheson testifies,
we'll call you to the stand.

12:08.187 --> 12:10.011
It's very important
you answer our questions

12:10.036 --> 12:12.471
specifically and clearly,
and that's it.

12:12.804 --> 12:14.364
Keep your answers as short as possible.

12:14.427 --> 12:15.765
The less you say,

12:15.923 --> 12:17.848
the less it gives the opposition.

12:19.025 --> 12:20.408
Nate, we agreed to this.

12:20.433 --> 12:23.068
I agreed to sign an
affidavit to help you.

12:23.267 --> 12:24.469
We go to court tomorrow.

12:24.494 --> 12:26.528
You can't back out now.

12:27.406 --> 12:29.037
Billy, I gotta live here.

12:29.235 --> 12:30.988
Look, once we expose what happened,

12:31.013 --> 12:33.181
people will change their minds.

12:33.952 --> 12:36.988
Nate, Matheson Steel poisoned our town.

12:38.891 --> 12:41.359
- We can subpoena you.
- Joanna...

12:51.377 --> 12:52.821
He'll show up.

12:56.069 --> 12:58.339
Your Honour, in order
to expedite these proceedings,

12:58.364 --> 13:00.791
the Defence requests
a bifurcated hearing.

13:01.339 --> 13:03.242
We ask that court to address
the issue of whether

13:03.266 --> 13:05.667
there is a case against
the parent company, P and L.

13:05.852 --> 13:08.854
Opposing counsel has offered
no proof of liability.

13:09.161 --> 13:11.006
And if there is
no case against P and L,

13:11.110 --> 13:14.512
there is no need for testimony
about causation or damages.

13:17.123 --> 13:19.124
We intend to prove that
Matheson Steel engaged

13:19.149 --> 13:21.836
in a systematic scheme
to dispose of toxic waste

13:21.861 --> 13:23.402
with the full knowledge of P and L,

13:23.427 --> 13:26.237
their parent company,
making them fully liable.

13:26.372 --> 13:27.988
The toxic waste product

13:28.013 --> 13:30.024
is the cause and fact of the symptoms

13:30.049 --> 13:32.017
suffered by our clients.

13:32.125 --> 13:34.093
It doesn't matter
what order we do this in.

13:34.173 --> 13:36.154
We'll proceed on the issue of liability

13:36.179 --> 13:37.582
of the parent company.

13:37.607 --> 13:38.945
Call your first witness.

13:39.019 --> 13:41.153
We call Ben Matheson to the stand.

13:44.990 --> 13:47.160
According to your filings,
your expenditure

13:47.185 --> 13:49.926
for toxic waste disposal
has remained consistent

13:49.951 --> 13:51.875
year after year.

13:52.594 --> 13:54.620
It's a good company, and I run it well.

13:54.707 --> 13:57.142
But your steel output keeps increasing,

13:57.463 --> 14:00.732
so how does your waste
remain consistent?

14:01.300 --> 14:02.881
Efficiencies.

14:04.484 --> 14:06.651
We pay for a company,
Secure and Collect,

14:06.693 --> 14:09.864
to dispose of everything
safely and legally.

14:11.078 --> 14:12.858
So under oath,

14:13.052 --> 14:14.270
you are telling this court

14:14.295 --> 14:16.899
that you never disposed
of any toxic waste,

14:16.995 --> 14:18.834
knew of the disposal of waste

14:18.891 --> 14:21.226
or ordered the disposal of waste?

14:21.567 --> 14:25.003
- I abide by the rules.
- So your answer is no.

14:30.335 --> 14:32.537
I've never dumped a thing.

14:34.540 --> 14:36.589
We call Nate Dawson to the stand.

14:46.859 --> 14:48.793
How long have you
worked at Matheson Steel?

14:48.873 --> 14:51.020
About 25 years.

14:51.045 --> 14:53.573
And in that time,
do you know if toxic waste

14:53.598 --> 14:55.292
was ever disposed of illegally?

14:55.361 --> 14:57.362
- Yeah.
- How do you know?

14:58.292 --> 14:59.395
Because I did it.

15:00.475 --> 15:02.081
Can you be more specific?

15:02.327 --> 15:03.820
About three or four times

15:03.845 --> 15:06.080
a year, there'd be more barrels.

15:06.327 --> 15:08.948
Uhm, we didn't produce much waste,

15:08.973 --> 15:11.108
but they wanted a fortune
to get rid of it.

15:11.256 --> 15:12.650
Where do they take it instead?

15:12.675 --> 15:15.172
First, it was around Southvale Farms,

15:15.311 --> 15:17.041
but look around Millwood,

15:17.109 --> 15:18.634
drive 30 minutes in any direction,

15:18.659 --> 15:20.547
and you'll find a place
to stick a barrel.

15:24.972 --> 15:27.000
This is the sonar readout

15:27.066 --> 15:29.601
from the area around Southvale Farm.

15:35.513 --> 15:37.314
Those are the barrels from Matheson.

15:37.843 --> 15:39.873
I thought they paid Secure and Collect

15:39.904 --> 15:41.039
to dump that waste.

15:41.138 --> 15:43.346
Secure and Collect is
just a front company

15:43.371 --> 15:44.643
to funnel money.

15:45.117 --> 15:47.948
Matheson Steel pays them
to collect the waste,

15:48.113 --> 15:50.215
they dump it and pocket the money.

15:50.286 --> 15:51.961
Who pockets the money?

15:52.819 --> 15:53.973
Ben Matheson.

15:55.427 --> 15:56.922
He's probably got money
hidden everywhere.

15:56.946 --> 15:58.555
Check his mattress.

15:59.765 --> 16:01.666
Did somebody order you

16:01.787 --> 16:03.497
to dump those barrels?

16:03.969 --> 16:05.280
Ben Matheson.

16:06.752 --> 16:08.558
He also paid me an extra grand a month

16:08.583 --> 16:10.455
to do it and keep my mouth shut.

16:13.313 --> 16:15.180
Ben Matheson testified under oath

16:15.221 --> 16:16.517
that he didn't know anything

16:16.542 --> 16:18.480
about any illegal dumping.

16:19.228 --> 16:20.595
Ben Matheson is a liar.

16:23.508 --> 16:25.056
Order!

16:27.635 --> 16:29.867
Did Ben Matheson ever mention P and L,

16:29.892 --> 16:30.949
the parent company?

16:30.974 --> 16:32.995
Yeah. He said they liked
what he was doing.

16:33.358 --> 16:34.749
The mill kept making money.

16:34.807 --> 16:37.174
And you understood that to mean that...

16:37.357 --> 16:39.307
P and L knew what you were dumping

16:39.358 --> 16:41.155
and they wanted it to continue?

16:41.734 --> 16:44.636
That's how I understood it.
P and L knew.

16:45.604 --> 16:46.934
Thank you.

16:52.217 --> 16:54.007
You dumped waste

16:54.353 --> 16:55.668
from Matheson Steel

16:55.693 --> 16:57.846
all over Millwood on a regular basis?

16:58.157 --> 17:00.258
- Yes.
- You buried it?

17:00.326 --> 17:03.300
- Yes.
- Did you ever receive

17:03.382 --> 17:06.518
orders from P and L Head Office?

17:07.058 --> 17:08.125
No.

17:08.150 --> 17:10.163
Did you ever speak to anyone
at P and L? Ever?

17:10.188 --> 17:11.792
- No.
- Did Ben Matheson tell you

17:11.818 --> 17:13.886
at any time that P and L knew
what you were doing?

17:13.992 --> 17:15.531
- No.
- So your orders

17:15.556 --> 17:17.290
came directly from Ben Matheson

17:17.316 --> 17:18.454
at Matheson Steel?

17:18.484 --> 17:19.820
- Yes.
- OK.

17:25.451 --> 17:27.772
According to company records,
you earn...

17:27.839 --> 17:29.875
$42000 a year,

17:30.722 --> 17:32.869
so that extra grand every month

17:32.894 --> 17:34.382
must've come in handy.

17:35.770 --> 17:36.923
Sure.

17:37.035 --> 17:39.904
Sure. That extra $12000 a year,

17:40.058 --> 17:41.725
that's quite a bonus.

17:41.813 --> 17:44.348
And how long did you
say this was going on for?

17:44.429 --> 17:45.822
About five or six years.

17:54.513 --> 17:56.514
In your divorce settlement,

17:56.823 --> 17:58.824
a sworn court document,

17:59.157 --> 18:00.876
you didn't include that bonus

18:00.901 --> 18:02.685
in your financial statements.

18:07.092 --> 18:09.667
I guess I just have
one question for you.

18:10.402 --> 18:12.570
Were you lying to the family law court,

18:13.085 --> 18:15.520
or are you lying to this court?

18:16.476 --> 18:17.883
Which is it?

18:26.460 --> 18:28.467
You're overreacting.

18:29.813 --> 18:31.052
Look, it wasn't that bad.

18:31.077 --> 18:32.498
He contradicted Ben Matheson.

18:32.543 --> 18:34.344
He identified the barrels
in the ground.

18:34.369 --> 18:35.633
They impeached his credibility.

18:35.658 --> 18:37.034
It wasn't fatal.

18:39.356 --> 18:40.689
Stop!

18:41.553 --> 18:42.640
Please...

18:42.665 --> 18:44.482
Look, we've been through those boxes.

18:44.560 --> 18:45.610
All of them.

18:46.913 --> 18:47.976
The thing you're looking for,

18:48.000 --> 18:50.775
the document that says
P and L knew, it's not in there.

18:52.776 --> 18:54.425
Let me see the letter.

18:56.419 --> 18:59.120
We have to talk to the mayor.

18:59.644 --> 19:01.843
She threatened to expose him.

19:01.868 --> 19:02.943
Said she'd kept things.

19:02.968 --> 19:05.170
You don't think that's
worth a trip to City Hall?

19:05.862 --> 19:08.164
I can't talk to another one.

19:08.809 --> 19:10.678
Another one of my father's girls.

19:10.935 --> 19:12.426
So let me do it.

19:14.886 --> 19:17.560
- It's late, Billy.
- This'll only take a minute.

19:20.050 --> 19:21.788
I know you haven't supported our case.

19:21.852 --> 19:23.953
I can't take sides.

19:24.881 --> 19:25.980
All due respect,

19:26.005 --> 19:28.207
you have taken sides.

19:28.385 --> 19:29.718
Watch your tone there, Billy.

19:29.814 --> 19:33.003
This isn't about the girls...
or the Mill.

19:34.144 --> 19:36.222
This is about Millwood against P and L.

19:36.247 --> 19:37.912
Us against them.

19:38.301 --> 19:40.524
Those barrels we found
at Southvale Farms...

19:40.612 --> 19:41.870
How long do you think before that's

19:41.894 --> 19:43.526
in the town's drinking water?

19:43.874 --> 19:45.059
On your watch.

19:45.142 --> 19:47.010
I don't know what you want me to do.

19:48.030 --> 19:49.764
You worked for David Hanley.

19:50.046 --> 19:51.157
For a couple of summers.

19:51.182 --> 19:53.405
I was a college student.

19:55.413 --> 19:57.848
The relationship didn't end there.

20:01.211 --> 20:02.431
You threatened to expose him

20:02.456 --> 20:04.423
unless he left his wife.

20:05.056 --> 20:06.710
You kept documents

20:07.098 --> 20:08.672
to protect yourself.

20:10.093 --> 20:11.966
You don't know
what you're talking about.

20:12.156 --> 20:14.695
- It's time for you to leave.
- We need you!

20:21.705 --> 20:23.130
I get it.

20:25.309 --> 20:27.310
Us against them...

20:29.461 --> 20:31.462
and you're choosing them.

20:38.145 --> 20:39.840
I helped vet Nate...

20:39.950 --> 20:42.421
to find out what the other side
might discover.

20:42.453 --> 20:45.148
- I didn't find that.
- It's not your fault.

20:45.269 --> 20:48.037
- I let everyone down.
- No, you didn't.

20:48.078 --> 20:50.379
You're 18. You're not a lawyer.

20:51.387 --> 20:53.154
I just realized something.

20:53.843 --> 20:55.813
You suck at pep talks.

20:56.047 --> 20:58.281
You wanna hear the truth, right?

21:03.268 --> 21:05.357
I'm gonna enroll
in the clinical program

21:05.710 --> 21:07.544
to see if they can help me get better.

21:07.657 --> 21:09.792
So, we're moving to Winnipeg.

21:10.059 --> 21:12.097
Sweet. Go, Goldeyes.

21:12.176 --> 21:14.310
No, Luna. You have to go to Montreal.

21:14.838 --> 21:17.072
I'm not going without you.

21:17.740 --> 21:19.424
OK. Can we just,

21:19.484 --> 21:21.950
for a second, forget about the Benzene

21:21.975 --> 21:24.042
and the twitching.

21:24.342 --> 21:26.424
You've talked about Montreal for years.

21:26.449 --> 21:28.099
You learned French.

21:28.745 --> 21:30.023
You have to go.

21:31.127 --> 21:32.491
I love you.

21:32.516 --> 21:33.951
I know.

21:34.851 --> 21:36.441
And we have cell phones.

21:36.501 --> 21:38.302
And we have videochats.

21:38.327 --> 21:42.031
And... you can write me letters.

21:42.825 --> 21:44.364
Longdistance?

21:44.654 --> 21:46.591
You have to follow
your dreams and have faith

21:46.616 --> 21:48.358
that we'll make it.

21:50.867 --> 21:52.481
Believe in us.

21:59.522 --> 22:01.380
If we lose the motion,
we can appeal it.

22:01.405 --> 22:04.368
It just... gives us time
to find new evidence.

22:06.985 --> 22:08.469
I should never have come to Millwood.

22:08.500 --> 22:10.029
- Come on.
- If I hadn't come,

22:10.054 --> 22:11.756
my father wouldn't
have gotten involved.

22:11.781 --> 22:14.032
CTS wouldn't have dropped the hammer.

22:14.247 --> 22:15.502
I brought this on them.

22:15.565 --> 22:18.227
If you hadn't come, we never
would have found the barrels.

22:18.488 --> 22:20.423
Girls would still be getting sick.

22:22.460 --> 22:24.694
We didn't make a mistake
taking this on.

22:27.151 --> 22:28.648
We tried.

22:30.627 --> 22:32.327
We were ambitious.

22:36.667 --> 22:38.668
Plus, you got to come home for a while.

23:16.249 --> 23:18.250
David Hanley.

23:20.542 --> 23:21.888
You again.

23:22.253 --> 23:23.582
On behalf of Molly Ross

23:23.607 --> 23:24.673
and the girls of Millwood,

23:24.698 --> 23:26.700
we are calling you
as a material witness

23:26.725 --> 23:29.319
in the case against P and L.

23:33.105 --> 23:34.939
You've been served.

23:44.317 --> 23:46.717
P and L was a client and they
were looking for acquisitions.

23:46.810 --> 23:49.151
I grew up in Millwood.
I knew the Mathesons.

23:49.176 --> 23:50.896
I thought I could
negotiate a good price.

23:50.921 --> 23:52.629
And what was that price?

23:53.992 --> 23:55.719
I don't recall.

23:58.234 --> 23:59.813
I do a lot of deals.

24:04.613 --> 24:07.224
This is a copy of
the Purchase and Sale Agreement.

24:09.557 --> 24:11.263
Can you read the purchase
and sale price?

24:11.288 --> 24:14.179
- It's on the first page.
- 28 million.

24:14.332 --> 24:16.278
And can you read the liability clause?

24:16.872 --> 24:19.113
The standard clause for
when the buyer assumes liability

24:19.138 --> 24:20.909
for any future lawsuits.

24:23.519 --> 24:25.154
You know it isn't in there.

24:25.239 --> 24:27.367
It's boilerplate.
It doesn't have to be there.

24:27.530 --> 24:29.531
It was a rushed deal.

24:33.811 --> 24:35.930
I'd like to enter
into evidence a draft copy

24:35.955 --> 24:37.547
of the purchase and sale agreement.

24:37.581 --> 24:39.258
Objection. We don't know
the source of that document.

24:39.282 --> 24:41.698
This document was
withheld from us in discovery.

24:42.084 --> 24:43.560
Proceed.

24:47.694 --> 24:49.140
Thank you.

24:51.280 --> 24:54.448
Is that a draft copy of the
Purchase and Sale Agreement?

24:56.849 --> 24:57.990
Yes, it is.

24:58.015 --> 25:00.136
And those are those
your notes in the margin?

25:00.277 --> 25:03.737
- Yes.
- Is there a liability clause?

25:05.019 --> 25:06.502
Page three.

25:09.209 --> 25:10.255
Yes.

25:10.280 --> 25:12.027
So, before you said
that it was standard

25:12.052 --> 25:13.334
and it didn't need to be in there,

25:13.358 --> 25:14.627
but it was there.

25:14.652 --> 25:15.885
So it was removed?

25:17.792 --> 25:18.988
Yeah. Yes.

25:19.022 --> 25:21.160
What's the sale price?
It's on the front page.

25:21.747 --> 25:24.975
- $30 million.
- So it dropped $2 million.

25:26.222 --> 25:27.769
Was that the price of removing

25:27.794 --> 25:29.406
liability for any lawsuits?

25:30.782 --> 25:33.603
This is a draft, and you can't
draw any conclusions.

25:33.637 --> 25:35.364
We have the sale of a mill.

25:35.719 --> 25:36.854
And it looks like the price dropped

25:36.878 --> 25:38.881
just before the final deal
in exchange for looking

25:38.906 --> 25:40.305
the other way on liability.

25:40.377 --> 25:43.266
The kind of liability
for dumping toxic waste.

25:43.347 --> 25:44.480
Objection, speculation.

25:44.515 --> 25:45.648
Withdrawn.

25:47.192 --> 25:48.670
P and L knew the entire time.

25:48.978 --> 25:50.486
It kept Matheson Steel profitable.

25:50.760 --> 25:52.802
- Objection.
- Withdrawn.

25:55.154 --> 25:56.922
There's a note in the margin

25:56.947 --> 25:58.704
next to the liability clause.

25:58.828 --> 26:00.662
Can you read that?

26:09.623 --> 26:12.675
Would you read what is
written in the margin?

26:14.780 --> 26:16.189
It's a simple question, Your Honour.

26:16.213 --> 26:18.626
The Defence requests a recess

26:18.651 --> 26:19.701
in order to study this document.

26:19.725 --> 26:21.095
No. He has to answer the question.

26:21.120 --> 26:22.210
What is written in the margin?

26:22.234 --> 26:23.707
- We're owed more time.
- "Barrels."

26:23.732 --> 26:25.107
- Counsel...
- In the notes

26:25.132 --> 26:27.666
for future lawsuits, it says "barrels."

26:27.691 --> 26:29.755
Counsel, you are out of order.

26:30.314 --> 26:32.170
This court is in recess until tomorrow.

26:32.195 --> 26:33.338
The Witness may step down.

26:33.363 --> 26:34.569
No. You can't excuse the witness.

26:34.593 --> 26:36.151
He has to answer for this!

26:50.948 --> 26:53.382
My clients are willing
to increase their offer.

26:54.635 --> 26:56.509
- We're listening.
- They'll double it.

26:56.572 --> 26:58.981
500 grand for each girl
paid out over 10 years.

26:59.039 --> 27:00.380
No.

27:02.082 --> 27:03.802
I'm sure your clients
would want to hear it.

27:03.830 --> 27:05.845
We want you to clean up the dump site.

27:06.637 --> 27:09.109
And we want
a $1 million fund for future cleanup.

27:09.134 --> 27:11.455
And $2 million each per girl.

27:11.549 --> 27:13.941
Hey, you wanna go to trial,
that's fine with me.

27:14.160 --> 27:15.638
The only people in a class action

27:15.663 --> 27:17.406
who are guaranteed to win are
the defence lawyers.

27:17.430 --> 27:19.424
My clock's running. What about yours?

27:19.617 --> 27:21.577
Agree to our terms...

27:21.881 --> 27:23.089
or here's what's gonna happen.

27:23.114 --> 27:25.415
We're gonna go back
into that courtroom...

27:27.198 --> 27:29.380
and I'm gonna ask you about this.

27:32.920 --> 27:34.266
Go back to your client

27:34.291 --> 27:36.392
and sell them on our settlement offer.

27:37.128 --> 27:38.493
You make them take it.

27:38.518 --> 27:41.364
Otherwise, I will
introduce that into open court.

27:43.004 --> 27:44.832
That's how it's gonna be?

27:52.908 --> 27:54.377
What was that?

28:01.756 --> 28:03.386
It's Gerrilyn's birth certificate.

28:05.289 --> 28:06.314
When Luna was born,

28:06.339 --> 28:08.307
when she and my dad were together,

28:08.558 --> 28:10.392
Gerrilyn was underage.

28:19.742 --> 28:22.244
- Thank you.
- No problem.

28:24.922 --> 28:26.518
Hello, Diane.

28:26.646 --> 28:27.892
Hi, Owen.

28:28.031 --> 28:29.999
I... saw you come in here.

28:30.287 --> 28:32.502
- Just getting dinner.
- Yeah.

28:32.696 --> 28:34.057
Hey...

28:35.231 --> 28:37.753
I'm not going to let Mercer win.

28:37.947 --> 28:41.115
- You need to be careful.
- Nah... I've been careful.

28:41.831 --> 28:44.366
It almost got me killed.

28:45.722 --> 28:47.690
I'm blocking you

28:47.715 --> 28:49.298
from leaving.

28:49.408 --> 28:51.233
It's a gesture,

28:51.401 --> 28:53.889
I'm not letting you leave Lucy's,

28:53.914 --> 28:56.504
and I'm not letting you leave Millwood.

28:59.629 --> 29:00.838
It's really complicated.

29:00.863 --> 29:02.945
No. You love your job and the school.

29:03.733 --> 29:05.614
I'm not looking
to let you give that up.

29:06.916 --> 29:08.364
Owen, what is this about?

29:08.484 --> 29:09.985
You don't have to leave

29:10.837 --> 29:12.221
because it's hard.

29:12.828 --> 29:14.123
I can help.

29:14.454 --> 29:16.892
You need a support system.

29:17.446 --> 29:19.547
And I can be in that equation.

29:22.531 --> 29:24.765
You have to let me meet your kids.

29:51.940 --> 29:54.075
Good morning. Please be seated.

30:02.489 --> 30:04.708
The court has in front of it today

30:05.041 --> 30:07.676
a proposed settlement agreement.

30:07.936 --> 30:10.417
P and I will clean up the dumpsite,

30:10.611 --> 30:12.172
and will provide an additional

30:12.197 --> 30:14.877
$1 million fund for future cleanup,

30:14.932 --> 30:17.655
and a $2 million payment

30:17.680 --> 30:20.538
to each and every plaintiff.

30:21.269 --> 30:23.837
Counsel, what is your answer?

30:25.468 --> 30:27.989
Your Honour,
as to the proposed settlement...

30:31.505 --> 30:32.922
my client agrees.

30:37.658 --> 30:39.259
The court approves the
settlement agreement

30:39.283 --> 30:40.297
and we bring the matter

30:40.322 --> 30:42.737
of Molly Ross v Matheson Steel
to a close.

30:42.762 --> 30:44.351
Court is adjourned.

31:26.949 --> 31:28.791
P and L cut me a deal.

31:29.158 --> 31:31.993
I get a bonus if I keep the
settlement under 20 million...

31:33.277 --> 31:36.512
so I'm gonna make more money
on this thing than anyone.

31:39.126 --> 31:40.740
Well, aren't you clever?

32:15.041 --> 32:16.590
Hey. Two beers?

32:16.728 --> 32:18.240
Two million!

32:18.275 --> 32:19.528
That's for medical bills,

32:19.553 --> 32:21.087
and if anything else
comes up in the future.

32:21.111 --> 32:22.133
But we just get it?

32:22.158 --> 32:24.006
Like, in cash? In our bank accounts?

32:24.031 --> 32:26.385
No, you don't just get it
like a big bag of cash.

32:26.853 --> 32:27.905
It's structured.

32:27.930 --> 32:29.493
We're gonna help you
organize everything.

32:29.517 --> 32:30.976
Thanks, Mr. Crawford.

32:36.618 --> 32:38.905
We wouldn't have won this
without you, Molly.

32:39.707 --> 32:41.280
Case MVP.

32:44.541 --> 32:48.444
- Here's to you!
- Cheers!

32:51.247 --> 32:53.114
You two make a pretty good team.

32:53.314 --> 32:54.988
Yeah. The perfect combination.

32:55.108 --> 32:56.879
- Oil and water.
- Come on.

32:56.913 --> 32:58.770
You can't tell me
you haven't thought about it.

32:58.795 --> 33:01.678
- We were busy with the case.
- OK. Well...

33:02.303 --> 33:03.745
the case is over.

33:09.543 --> 33:10.856
Hey.

33:21.783 --> 33:23.272
I'm not afraid of him anymore.

33:23.730 --> 33:26.041
Luna's of age. He can't
take her from me.

33:27.302 --> 33:29.398
It's time he got what's coming to him.

33:32.192 --> 33:33.382
You don't think I should.

33:33.479 --> 33:35.384
No, you should.

33:36.716 --> 33:37.753
But he won't go to jail.

33:38.537 --> 33:39.688
He will find a way out.

33:39.713 --> 33:41.294
And you're gonna have to relive this

33:41.319 --> 33:42.725
all over again.

33:43.700 --> 33:44.996
Our legal system is built

33:45.021 --> 33:47.373
so that people like my father...

33:48.472 --> 33:50.132
get away with everything.

33:51.045 --> 33:52.350
Excuse me.

33:58.286 --> 34:00.227
So, the case is over.

34:01.006 --> 34:02.780
Does this mean you're leaving?

34:03.947 --> 34:07.316
Right. I get it.

34:09.340 --> 34:10.777
I don't think that sisters

34:10.802 --> 34:13.241
have to stay together all the time.

34:13.956 --> 34:16.190
I think they can go out and...

34:17.641 --> 34:19.424
and live their lives,

34:20.311 --> 34:22.498
knowing that they're
always a part of each other.

34:22.710 --> 34:25.766
Well, I wasn't planning
on being your assistant forever.

34:26.161 --> 34:28.596
I have big plans.

34:43.905 --> 34:45.873
Can I buy you a drink?

34:46.201 --> 34:48.469
I just came into some money.

34:55.251 --> 34:57.460
They can shell out millions
for a settlement.

34:57.667 --> 35:00.211
An apology... costs them nothing,

35:00.242 --> 35:02.232
but my dad still won't say it.

35:03.018 --> 35:04.422
Not even to me.

35:04.805 --> 35:06.751
An apology is easy to give

35:06.797 --> 35:08.544
when it means nothing,

35:09.051 --> 35:11.653
and so hard when it actually matters.

35:15.431 --> 35:16.992
Taylor, I...

35:17.351 --> 35:19.156
I wish I could have
done something for you.

35:19.971 --> 35:21.154
I'll be fine.

35:21.234 --> 35:23.641
You know how hard it is
to make cheer captain?

35:24.425 --> 35:26.117
Cancer's a cinch.

35:33.110 --> 35:35.112
My dad always had to win.

35:35.231 --> 35:37.139
In every case,

35:37.878 --> 35:39.575
in every conversation.

35:41.343 --> 35:43.078
But at some point,
you have to take the leap

35:43.103 --> 35:44.937
and decide what's right for you.

35:49.059 --> 35:51.627
And sometimes, that means walking away.

36:15.117 --> 36:16.485
You ran away.

36:16.671 --> 36:18.539
The case is over. I should go.

36:18.564 --> 36:20.616
Get out your way.

36:21.102 --> 36:22.331
Where are you going?

36:22.356 --> 36:24.830
I thought all the case files
should be in the same spot.

36:25.096 --> 36:26.555
Here.

36:28.115 --> 36:30.417
Hey, um...

36:30.607 --> 36:34.209
About our fee, you need to tell
me where to send your half.

36:34.234 --> 36:35.733
Just give mine back to the girls.

36:35.758 --> 36:37.278
Come on. You earned it.

36:37.917 --> 36:39.165
I don't want it.

36:41.904 --> 36:43.392
Joanna...

36:47.441 --> 36:49.334
Joanna, you can stop running.

36:52.311 --> 36:53.782
People love you in Millwood.

36:54.403 --> 36:56.032
OK, look. Not everybody.

36:56.238 --> 36:57.798
Some people.

36:58.518 --> 37:00.189
The right people.

37:00.988 --> 37:02.825
You're quirky, and you're weird,

37:02.930 --> 37:04.246
and...

37:05.334 --> 37:07.502
you're a lot of work sometimes, but...

37:08.223 --> 37:09.901
I know you like it here.

37:11.981 --> 37:13.554
Except for a few bumps
at the beginning,

37:13.579 --> 37:15.200
we made pretty good partners.

37:18.147 --> 37:20.217
Yeah. It wasn't a great start.

37:25.781 --> 37:28.282
All that matters is the finish.

37:30.931 --> 37:32.888
We have complimentary skillsets.

37:34.550 --> 37:35.757
Nice cop,

37:35.792 --> 37:37.284
weird, uptight cop?

37:37.878 --> 37:39.223
Exactly.

37:40.848 --> 37:42.494
That's why it could work.

37:44.200 --> 37:46.101
It could be Crawford Hanley.

37:46.439 --> 37:47.769
Or...

37:49.499 --> 37:50.836
Hanley Crawford.

37:57.980 --> 38:00.248
Billy, I'm sorry.

38:04.633 --> 38:06.500
I, um...

38:08.858 --> 38:11.092
I got offered a job in Winnipeg.

38:13.792 --> 38:15.397
I'm going to accept it.

38:31.492 --> 38:34.268
So... that was a cryptic text.

38:40.503 --> 38:43.505
I didn't wanna disappear a
second time without telling you.

38:44.343 --> 38:45.674
So where are you going?

38:45.836 --> 38:47.218
I took a new job.

38:47.957 --> 38:49.345
It's close to my mother.

38:50.653 --> 38:52.715
New job, new firm.

38:53.276 --> 38:54.662
I hope it's not like CTS.

38:54.710 --> 38:56.255
Yeah, it feels different.

38:56.741 --> 38:58.404
Maybe you're just different.

38:59.067 --> 39:00.620
You're saying goodbye this time,

39:00.645 --> 39:02.613
so that's an improvement.

39:04.455 --> 39:06.195
Did Billy ask you to stay?

39:06.776 --> 39:07.976
I can't hang up a sign

39:08.001 --> 39:09.683
with the name Hanley on it.

39:09.741 --> 39:10.969
Not in Millwood.

39:13.635 --> 39:16.372
You are not him.

39:18.341 --> 39:20.423
It was never on you

39:20.496 --> 39:22.363
to pay for his sins.

39:26.842 --> 39:29.276
Diane, I didn't come here
to say goodbye.

39:30.347 --> 39:31.787
We could keep in touch.

39:32.705 --> 39:33.891
Even better.

39:34.658 --> 39:36.828
By phone. I don't have
any social media.

39:36.971 --> 39:39.215
Really, you don't? That is shocking.

39:56.465 --> 39:58.433
OK. Moment of truth.

39:58.548 --> 40:00.105
East or west coast?

40:00.208 --> 40:03.010
Um... which one's closer?

40:03.118 --> 40:04.848
I think we're right in the middle.

40:06.335 --> 40:07.990
OK, which one has a better ocean?

40:08.114 --> 40:10.759
They're both great. Very different.

40:11.347 --> 40:13.348
I'm more Pacific.

40:14.330 --> 40:16.765
Spiritual, loving and mysterious.

40:17.006 --> 40:18.751
OK.

40:20.033 --> 40:21.737
You're Atlantic.

40:22.397 --> 40:24.668
Strong, determined and beautiful.

40:27.483 --> 40:30.452
- Let's see your ocean first.
- OK.

40:30.792 --> 40:32.693
Wait! You forgot something.

40:32.795 --> 40:34.762
What?

40:36.832 --> 40:39.667
The best part about road trips.

40:42.836 --> 40:44.145
Let's go.

42:48.384 --> 42:50.285
Good morning. Crawford and Associates.

42:51.466 --> 42:54.502
Yes, we did handle
the Millwood steel case.

42:56.579 --> 42:58.447
All right. Well, um...

42:58.553 --> 42:59.766
Why don't we set up a meeting

42:59.791 --> 43:02.737
and my associates and I
can look into it?

43:03.025 --> 43:05.827
No. No case is too big for us.

43:29.605 --> 43:30.890
Steadman Lavery.

43:30.963 --> 43:32.605
I'm a new partner. It's my first day.

43:32.648 --> 43:34.189
And your name?
