08:27.089 --> 08:28.257
SHE WAS HUGGING YOU
TO SAY THANKS?

08:28.341 --> 08:30.134
- FOR SOME ADVICE
I WAS GIVING HER.

08:30.218 --> 08:32.470
- WELL, WHY WOULD WILLOW
COME TO YOU FOR ADVICE?

08:32.553 --> 08:34.554
YOU HARDLY KNOW HER, DO YOU?

BECAUSE SHE WANTED ADVICE

- WHAT ABOUT HIM?

08:41.437 --> 08:43.688
- SHE'S GOT A CRUSH ON HIM!

08:43.773 --> 08:45.107
- I KNEW IT!

08:45.191 --> 08:46.776

ON OPEN DAY WAS ABOUT HIM,

IT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN

08:51.614 --> 08:52.949

08:53.032 --> 08:57.411
- WELL, SHE'S FAIRLY SURE
HE DOESN'T LIKE HER.

TO GET OFF HER CHEST.

SO THERE'S REALLY NO POINT
IN SAYING ANYTHING TO ALFIE.

FOR A VERY LONG TIME.

09:41.789 --> 09:43.165
WHAT DID THEY BELIEVE?

09:43.249 --> 09:44.166
- THE EGYPTIANS BELIEVED--

09:44.250 --> 09:46.002
- THEY BELIEVED
THAT A HUGE, EVIL SNAKE

09:46.085 --> 09:48.337
ENCIRCLED THE EARTH AND FOUGHT
THE SUN GOD EVERY DAY.

09:48.421 --> 09:49.588
MOST DAYS,
THE SNAKE WAS DEFEATED,

09:49.672 --> 09:52.008
AND THE SUN CAME UP
JUST AS NORMAL.

09:52.091 --> 09:55.386
BUT EVERY SO OFTEN,
THE SNAKE DEVOURED THE SUN.

09:55.469 --> 10:00.599
EVIL WON, AND DARKNESS
FELL UPON THE EARTH.

10:00.683 --> 10:03.144
- THAT'S VERY GOOD, FABIAN.

10:11.610 --> 10:13.529
OH, KT, I ALMOST FORGOT.

10:13.612 --> 10:15.656
COULD YOU RUN
AN ERRAND FOR ME, PLEASE?

10:15.740 --> 10:16.782
- ME?

10:16.866 --> 10:18.034
- YES, COULD YOU GO
TO THE COMMON ROOM

10:18.117 --> 10:21.329
AND PICK UP THE ASTRONOMY BOOKS
I LEFT ON THE STAGE?

10:21.412 --> 10:23.372
I FORGOT
TO BRING THEM WITH ME.

10:23.456 --> 10:24.332
- [mouthing words]

10:24.415 --> 10:27.043
- UM--
- NOW, PLEASE.

10:27.126 --> 10:28.127
- OKAY.

10:31.047 --> 10:31.672
- I--NO SWEAT.

10:31.756 --> 10:33.382
I'LL GO GRAB THEM.

10:33.466 --> 10:35.468
- YOU NEED THE EXTRA STUDY,
EDISON.

10:35.551 --> 10:36.802
SIT.

10:36.886 --> 10:38.137
- I'LL GO.

10:38.220 --> 10:40.556
I MEAN, I'M THE BEST
AT CARRYING BOOKS.

10:40.639 --> 10:42.224
EVERYONE ALWAYS SAYS SO.

10:42.308 --> 10:44.185
- NO.

10:44.268 --> 10:45.936
I WANT KT TO GO.

10:50.733 --> 10:54.445
- I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

10:54.528 --> 10:55.738
- I TOLD YOU.

10:55.821 --> 10:57.823
THEY'RE GONNA TRY
AND KIDNAP HER.

11:10.544 --> 11:12.254
- SOMEONE THERE?

11:14.340 --> 11:16.384
- IT IS HIGHLY DANGEROUS
TO GAZE DIRECTLY AT AN ECLIPSE.

11:16.467 --> 11:18.552
[phone vibrating]

11:18.636 --> 11:20.096
THAT IS BECAUSE THE EYE--

11:20.179 --> 11:21.597
- EDDIE, WE HAVE
TO DO SOMETHING.

11:21.680 --> 11:23.766
- I GOT A TEXT FROM KT.

11:23.849 --> 11:25.101
- WHAT DOES IT SAY?

11:25.184 --> 11:27.144
- "HELP."

11:33.025 --> 11:35.444
- SO AS YOU WILL SEE,

11:35.528 --> 11:38.280
WITH MY HOMEMADE VIEWER,

11:38.364 --> 11:41.033
YOU CAN NOW WATCH AN ECLIPSE
IN COMPLETE SAFE--

11:41.117 --> 11:44.829
- I JUST REALIZED, MR. SWEET,
I--I LEFT MY LOCKER OPEN.

11:44.912 --> 11:46.622
- WELL, IT'LL HAVE TO WAIT.
NOW, THE ONLY SAFE WAY--

11:46.705 --> 11:49.375
- MR. SWEET.
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

11:49.458 --> 11:51.544
I--MY ALLOWANCE IS IN IT.

11:51.627 --> 11:55.172
I MEAN, THE MONEY YOU GAVE ME.

11:55.256 --> 11:56.549
SO REALLY IT'S LIKE
YOUR MONEY AT RISK.

11:56.632 --> 11:59.552
- WELL, VERY WELL.
BE QUICK.

11:59.635 --> 12:01.262
STOP!

12:01.345 --> 12:03.889
YOUR JACKET.

12:03.973 --> 12:06.016
I'VE TOLD YOU 100 TIMES.

12:06.100 --> 12:09.728
THAT IS NOT SCHOOL UNIFORM.

12:09.812 --> 12:09.895
- YEAH.

12:26.078 --> 12:27.788
- KT!

12:27.872 --> 12:29.415
- THANK YOU AGAIN.

12:29.498 --> 12:31.333
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I WAS SO FORGETFUL.

12:31.417 --> 12:32.209
- NO PROBLEM, MISS.

12:32.293 --> 12:36.922
- EDDIE.

12:37.006 --> 12:38.799
- WE THOUGHT
YOU HAD BEEN KIDNAPPED.

12:38.883 --> 12:40.843
- WHAT?
NO.

12:40.926 --> 12:42.845
SHE ASKED TO BORROW MY PHONE,
WHICH IS KIND OF WEIRD.

12:42.928 --> 12:44.930
SHE SAID THAT SHE LEFT HERS
AT THE GATEHOUSE

12:45.014 --> 12:47.349
AND THAT SHE NEEDED
TO TEXT SOMEBODY.

12:47.433 --> 12:49.018
- SHE TEXTED ME!
IT WAS ME!

12:49.101 --> 12:51.020
- HUH?

12:51.103 --> 12:54.315
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

12:54.398 --> 12:55.733
IT'S A TRICK, OKAY?

12:55.816 --> 12:56.859
IT'S NOT ABOUT YOU.
THEY NEEDED ME OUT OF CLASS.

13:00.946 --> 13:01.947
- EDDIE.

13:02.031 --> 13:02.948
EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

13:03.032 --> 13:04.533
NOTHING MISSING, I HOPE.

13:04.617 --> 13:05.701
- WHERE'D EVERYONE GO?

13:05.784 --> 13:07.203
- OH, I'VE SENT THEM ALL OUT
TO WORK

13:07.286 --> 13:09.997
ON THEIR INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS.

13:10.080 --> 13:12.208
UH,

13:12.291 --> 13:14.043
HERE YOU GO.

13:14.126 --> 13:18.047
YOU'LL BE NEEDING THAT.

13:18.130 --> 13:19.632
- OSIRIAN, YOU IDIOT!

13:19.715 --> 13:20.799
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

13:20.883 --> 13:21.800
WHY ARE YOU ACTING SO--

13:21.884 --> 13:23.260
- NO, THE BRACELET, OKAY?

13:23.344 --> 13:25.346
IT WAS IN MY JACKET,
AND NOW IT'S GONE.

13:25.429 --> 13:26.597
MY DAD TOOK IT.

13:26.680 --> 13:27.973
THEY HAVE THE BRACELET.

13:35.856 --> 13:37.233
- OH, HEY, MARA.

13:37.316 --> 13:39.151
OH, IF YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR JEROME, HE'S NOT HERE.

13:39.235 --> 13:40.069
- I'M LOOKING FOR YOU.

13:40.152 --> 13:41.320
- OKAY, I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.

13:41.403 --> 13:44.823
UM--
- OKAY.

13:44.907 --> 13:48.118
I KNOW SOMEONE
WHO LIKES YOU A LOT.

13:48.202 --> 13:50.746
- NOW, FLATTERY WILL NOT GET YOU
ANY OF MY CHIPS, MARA.

13:50.829 --> 13:51.747
NO WAY.
- I'M SERIOUS.

13:51.830 --> 13:52.998
YOU'VE GOT AN ADMIRER.

13:53.082 --> 13:54.750
- AH.

13:54.833 --> 13:56.418
- AND ANYONE CAN SEE WHY.

13:56.502 --> 13:58.587
- I DON'T FOLLOW.

13:58.671 --> 14:04.760
- ALL I'LL SAY
IS W-I-DOUBLE L-O-W.

14:08.389 --> 14:11.058
- WILLWALL LIKES ME?

14:11.141 --> 14:12.810
WAIT, WILLOW?

14:12.893 --> 14:13.519
HMM.

14:13.602 --> 14:15.729
- THIS IS ALL MY FAULT.

14:15.813 --> 14:17.356
I SHOULD HAVE LISTENED
TO THE OTHERS.

14:17.439 --> 14:19.441
OKAY, HERE.

14:19.525 --> 14:20.401
- WHAT?

14:20.484 --> 14:21.360
- TRAIN SCHEDULE.

14:21.443 --> 14:22.695
YOU HAVE TO GET
OUT OF HERE TODAY.

14:22.778 --> 14:24.446
- KT, YOU'RE THE DESCENDENT.

14:24.530 --> 14:25.906
YOU'RE THE ONLY THING
THAT'S STOPPING THEM

14:25.990 --> 14:28.742
FROM COMPLETING THE CEREMONY,
NOW THEY HAVE THE BRACELET.

14:28.826 --> 14:30.202
- I CAN'T GO.
MY GREAT-GRANDPA--

14:30.286 --> 14:33.706
- HEY, A GREAT EVIL IS ABOUT
TO BE UNLEASHED, REMEMBER?

14:35.332 --> 14:38.377
- OKAY.

14:38.460 --> 14:39.795
ONLY THING,

14:39.878 --> 14:42.673
HOW DO WE CONVINCE SCHOOL
TO LET ME GO?

14:46.218 --> 14:49.555
- I HOPE YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING, MISS DENBY.

14:49.638 --> 14:50.848
- I AM WHOLLY COMMITTED
TO THOSE CHILDREN

14:50.931 --> 14:54.810
BEING ALL THAT THEY CAN BE,
VICTOR.

14:54.893 --> 14:56.645
- MM.

14:56.729 --> 14:58.689
- YOU KNOW THAT.

15:02.234 --> 15:03.527
- MM.

15:14.330 --> 15:17.750
- COME.

15:17.833 --> 15:19.710
AH, TRUDY.

15:19.793 --> 15:21.629
AND KT.

15:21.712 --> 15:24.757
PLEASE.

15:24.840 --> 15:26.550
TO WHAT DO I OWE THIS PLEASURE?

15:26.634 --> 15:29.428
- THIS LITTLE MITE IS HOMESICK.

15:29.511 --> 15:32.681
- HOMESICK?

15:32.765 --> 15:34.808
- SHE'S MISSING HER FAMILY,
AND PATRICIA SAYS SHE CRIES

15:34.892 --> 15:35.934
HERSELF TO SLEEP AT NIGHT,

15:36.018 --> 15:38.729
CALLING OUT
FOR HER LITTLE PUPPY.

15:38.812 --> 15:41.982
- YEAH, SHE MAY HAVE EXAGGERATED
ON THAT LAST BIT.

15:42.066 --> 15:44.735
- KT, IT'S NOT
THAT I'M UNSYMPATHETIC,

15:44.818 --> 15:47.029
BUT THIS IS A CRUCIAL TIME
FOR YOUR STUDIES.

15:47.112 --> 15:50.366
- MY STUDIES WILL SUFFER
IF I'M UNHAPPY.

15:50.449 --> 15:53.827
- I'D BE VERY RELUCTANT
TO LET YOU LEAVE.

15:53.911 --> 15:56.622
- MR. SWEET, AS HOUSEKEEPER,

15:56.705 --> 15:59.249
I HAVE A DUTY OF CARE TO KT,

15:59.333 --> 16:00.417
AND WELL, I CAN SEE
NO GOOD REASON

16:00.501 --> 16:03.170
WHY SHE SHOULD BE KEPT HERE
AT THE MOMENT.

16:06.382 --> 16:07.966
- ALL RIGHT.

16:08.050 --> 16:09.968
GO.

16:10.052 --> 16:12.471
- YAY.

16:12.554 --> 16:14.598
THANK YOU.

16:14.682 --> 16:15.099
QUICK, BEFORE HE CHANGES
HIS MIND.

16:20.312 --> 16:24.400
- I'M SORRY TO BE THE BEARER
OF BAD NEWS.

16:24.483 --> 16:26.985
- WAIT, ARE YOU SAYING
THAT WE FLUNKED HISTORY ALREADY?

16:27.069 --> 16:33.242
- THE THING IS,
MR. SWEET HINTED THAT, UM,

16:33.325 --> 16:35.953
IF YOU GUYS WERE TO FAIL
ONE MORE SUBJECT,

16:36.036 --> 16:37.538
YOU MIGHT LOSE
YOUR SCHOLARSHIPS.

16:37.621 --> 16:38.956
- WITHOUT THE SCHOLARSHIP,

16:39.039 --> 16:40.499
I'M GONNA HAVE TO
QUIT THE SCHOOL.

16:40.582 --> 16:42.710
- ME TOO.
- OH, LET'S NOT PANIC.

16:42.793 --> 16:44.712
IF YOU WERE TO GIVE
THIS ECLIPSE PROJECT

16:44.795 --> 16:46.964
A REALLY GOOD SHOT,

16:47.047 --> 16:50.759
I CAN MAKE SURE IT COUNTS
TOWARDS YOUR FINAL GRADES.

16:50.843 --> 16:52.469
- YOU CAN REALLY DO THAT?

16:52.553 --> 16:53.762
- LEAVE IT TO ME.

16:53.846 --> 16:55.848
WELL, NO TIME TO WASTE.

16:55.931 --> 16:58.684
FIRST GROUP MEETING
AT THE GATEHOUSE, TONIGHT.

16:58.767 --> 17:01.103
- HE AGREED TOO QUICKLY.

17:01.186 --> 17:02.563
WHY WOULD SWEET SAY YES

17:02.646 --> 17:04.440
IF THEY NEEDED ME
FOR THE CEREMONY?

17:04.522 --> 17:06.942
- SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT.
- I DON'T SEE HOW.

17:07.025 --> 17:08.402
I HAD EVERYTHING WORKED OUT.
I CAN'T HAVE MISSED ANYTHING.

17:08.484 --> 17:11.363
- ARE YOU SAYING THAT KT'S
NOT THE DESCENDENT, THEN?

17:11.446 --> 17:13.156
- OF COURSE I AM.

17:13.240 --> 17:14.782
THAT IS TOTALLY
MY GREAT-GRANDFATHER

17:14.867 --> 17:15.951
ASLEEP IN THAT TANK.

17:16.034 --> 17:17.869
- IT COULD BE A DOUBLE BLUFF.

17:17.953 --> 17:19.538
PERHAPS THEY'LL SWOOP IN
AND TRY AND GRAB KT

17:19.621 --> 17:21.248
BEFORE SHE HAS THE CHANCE
TO GET AWAY.

17:21.330 --> 17:22.624
- I DON'T LIKE THIS.

17:22.708 --> 17:24.292
OKAY, WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT THEY KNOW.

17:24.376 --> 17:26.837
- YEAH, AND HOW DO WE DO THAT?

17:26.920 --> 17:28.589
[stammers]

17:28.672 --> 17:29.965
- EDDIE?

17:30.048 --> 17:32.593
- OKAY, I'M GONNA GO
GET INTO MY DAD'S OFFICE, OKAY?

17:32.676 --> 17:33.260
I WANT TO SEE
WHAT THEY GOT ON YOU.

17:37.222 --> 17:38.599
- [sighs]

17:38.682 --> 17:40.684
- WELL, IT'S KIND OF A SHAME
THAT YOU'RE MOVING OUT.

17:40.768 --> 17:42.060
WE COULD HAVE PULLED
AN ALL-NIGHTER

17:42.144 --> 17:43.562
TO WORK ON THE PROJECT.

17:43.645 --> 17:45.022
- WILD.

17:45.105 --> 17:46.482
- I WAS THINKING,
IF WE CONCENTRATE

17:46.565 --> 17:49.985
ON THE SCIENTIFIC FACT
BEHIND THE ECLIPSES--

17:50.068 --> 17:53.280
- I LOVE SCIENCE.

17:53.363 --> 17:54.656
I'M A REALLY BIG FAN.

17:54.740 --> 17:55.949
- YOU ARE?

17:56.033 --> 17:57.993
WELL, WHAT'S
YOUR FAVORITE SCIENCE SUBJECT?

17:58.076 --> 17:59.328
- POTTERY.

17:59.411 --> 18:04.374
- POTTERY IS NOT EXACTLY
A SCIENCE.

18:04.458 --> 18:08.003
- THAT'S WHERE
I'VE BEEN GOING WRONG.

18:08.086 --> 18:11.173
- YOU'RE SO RIGHT FOR HIM.

18:11.256 --> 18:11.590
- WHAT'S THAT?

18:11.673 --> 18:13.509
- ALFIE.

18:13.592 --> 18:14.676
YOU AND ALFIE.

18:14.760 --> 18:16.553
YOU'D BE PERFECT TOGETHER.

18:16.637 --> 18:18.639
- ALFIE?

18:18.722 --> 18:19.515
- IT'D BE GREAT
IF YOU GOT WITH HIM.

18:19.598 --> 18:22.142
HE'S BEEN SO UNLUCKY IN LOVE.

18:22.226 --> 18:25.854
I WISH YOU COULD FIND
THE SAME THING AS ME AND JEROME.

18:25.938 --> 18:27.606
- BUT WE ALL NEED
TO MOVE ON SOMEDAY.

18:27.689 --> 18:30.025
DON'T WE, MARA?

18:30.108 --> 18:31.693
- YOU ARE SO RIGHT.

18:31.777 --> 18:35.280
WE ALL HAVE TO MOVE ON.

18:35.364 --> 18:37.574
- I'LL CERTAINLY THINK
ABOUT YOUR ADVICE.

18:37.658 --> 18:39.952
- I HOPE SO.

18:41.870 --> 18:45.707
[both mouthing words]

18:47.459 --> 18:49.461
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
MR. SWEET IS HERE?

18:49.545 --> 18:50.879
WHAT DOES HE WANT?
- I DON'T KNOW.

18:50.963 --> 18:52.047
HE JUST SAID
TO GO AND FIND YOU.

18:52.130 --> 18:53.882
- MAYBE HE CAUGHT EDDIE
SNEAKING INTO SCHOOL.

18:53.966 --> 18:55.217
OR MAYBE EDDIE TOLD.

18:55.300 --> 18:56.718
- YEAH, MAYBE HE JUST WANTS
TO HANG OUT.

18:56.802 --> 18:58.470
WE ARE PRETTY COOL.

18:58.554 --> 19:01.473
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
HE WOULD HAVE JUST ASKED ME.

19:01.557 --> 19:06.979
- AH, I'VE COME TO COLLECT YOU
FOR YOUR EXTRA TUITION.

19:07.062 --> 19:08.105
- SORRY, MR. SWEET.

19:08.188 --> 19:09.231
FOR A CRAZY SECOND THEN,

19:09.314 --> 19:11.066
I THOUGHT YOU SAID,
"EXTRA TUITION."

19:11.149 --> 19:12.734
- FOR THE ECLIPSE PROJECT.

19:12.818 --> 19:14.111
YOU DO KNOW
THAT MISS DENBY'S

19:14.194 --> 19:16.238
ARRANGED A LATE-NIGHT MEETING
FOR YOUR GROUP?

19:16.321 --> 19:18.448
JEROME AND JOY
ARE OVER THERE ALREADY.

19:18.532 --> 19:19.950
YOU'RE MISSING OUT
ON ALL THE FUN.

19:20.033 --> 19:20.909
- I CAN DO WITHOUT FUN.

19:20.993 --> 19:21.952
- ME TOO.
I HATE FUN.

19:22.035 --> 19:23.078
- WELL, DON'T WORRY.

19:23.161 --> 19:24.746
THERE'LL BE LOTS
OF HARD WORK TOO.

19:24.830 --> 19:30.085
AND WE DON'T WANT YOU TO MESS UP
ON THE BIG DAY, NOW, DO WE?

19:30.168 --> 19:31.253
<i>EXEAMUS.</i>

19:47.603 --> 19:49.938
- KT.

19:50.022 --> 19:51.607
DESCENDENT, DESCENDENT.

19:51.690 --> 19:54.192
NOTHING!

20:00.866 --> 20:02.868
I GUESS IT WON'T
DO ANY HARM TO LOOK.

20:02.951 --> 20:04.202
SEE IF ANYONE UNDERSTANDS HER.

20:12.794 --> 20:15.881
WAIT.

20:15.964 --> 20:17.507
WHAT?

20:23.138 --> 20:27.976
HEY, HEY, CHECK THIS OUT.

20:28.060 --> 20:29.853
- YOU STOLE PATRICIA'S FILE

20:29.937 --> 20:32.689
AND ALFIE'S AND JEROME'S, JOY'S.

20:32.773 --> 20:33.982
- LOOK, I'LL RETURN THEM, OKAY?

20:34.066 --> 20:36.318
BUT YOU NEVER WOULD HAVE
BELIEVED ME OTHERWISE.

20:36.401 --> 20:37.653
- BELIEVED WHAT?

20:37.736 --> 20:40.364
- OKAY, DID YOU KNOW
THAT ALFIE, PATRICIA, JEROME,

20:40.447 --> 20:42.991
AND JOY ARE ALL HERE
ON THE SAME SCHOLARSHIP?

20:43.075 --> 20:44.368
- NO.
WHY WOULD WE?

20:44.451 --> 20:48.372
- OKAY, IT'S CALLED
THE CANDY FOUNDATION FUND.

20:48.455 --> 20:49.873
- SO WHAT?

20:49.957 --> 20:51.875
- OKAY, SO WHAT DO YOU GUYS
CALL CANDY?

20:51.959 --> 20:54.002
- WE CALL THEM SWEETS.

20:54.086 --> 20:56.838
- AS IN MR. SWEET, THE SEEKER.

20:56.922 --> 20:58.507
- WAIT, ARE YOU SAYING
HE BROUGHT THEM HERE

20:58.590 --> 20:58.882
TO THE SCHOOL DELIBERATELY?

20:58.966 --> 20:59.716
WHY?

20:59.800 --> 21:00.842
- LOOK.

21:00.926 --> 21:03.387

21:03.470 --> 21:06.014
- OKAY, AND SEE, THIS
IS PATRICIA'S GREAT-GRANDMA.

21:06.098 --> 21:08.183
THIS IS ALFIE'S GREAT-GRANDPA,

21:08.266 --> 21:10.978
JEROME'S, JOY'S.

21:11.061 --> 21:13.105
- WAIT.

21:13.188 --> 21:14.272
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

21:14.356 --> 21:15.524
- WAIT.

21:15.607 --> 21:18.527
MY GREAT-GRANDFATHER'S
EXPEDITION PARTY.

21:18.610 --> 21:20.696
THEY'VE ALL GOT DESCENDENTS
AT THE SCHOOL?

21:20.779 --> 21:24.032
- THEY'RE THE DESCENDENTS,
NOT YOU.

21:24.116 --> 21:26.868
- THEY'RE THE ONES
THEY NEED FOR THE CEREMONY.

21:26.952 --> 21:28.537
- WE HAVE TO WARN THEM.

21:28.620 --> 21:30.622
- IT'S TOO LATE.

21:30.706 --> 21:33.125
THEY'VE ALL GONE
TO THE GATEHOUSE.

21:35.127 --> 21:36.795
- AH, THERE YOU ARE.

21:36.878 --> 21:39.172
STARTING TO THINK
YOU HAD OTHER PLANS.

21:39.256 --> 21:40.090
SO WHY DON'T WE ALL GO INSIDE,

21:40.173 --> 21:42.092
AND I'LL TELL YOU ALL ABOUT...

21:42.175 --> 21:43.844
[thunder crashes]

21:43.927 --> 21:45.721
THE VERY SPECIAL
ECLIPSE CEREMONY.

21:45.804 --> 21:46.555
- SUPER IDEA, MISS.

21:46.638 --> 21:48.682
- I THINK I'M GONNA GO BACK.

21:48.765 --> 21:50.058
YEAH, I'VE GOT A REALLY
IMPORTANT SANDWICH TO FINISH.

21:50.142 --> 21:52.394
- INSIDE, PLEASE, ALFIE.

21:52.477 --> 21:52.894
I INSIST.

21:52.978 --> 21:54.730
- INSIDE!
