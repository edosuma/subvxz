WEBVTT

00:01.674 --> 00:03.011
- You need to leave.
- Get out of my face.

00:03.011 --> 00:04.017
Hey...

00:04.032 --> 00:06.102
Oh, I get it. Is Helen
Keller, over here,

00:06.133 --> 00:07.331
-  why you're so mad?
- What is your...

00:07.331 --> 00:09.327
- Listen here, you...
- No, Toby!

00:10.360 --> 00:12.236
You must go to school with Travis?

00:12.241 --> 00:13.662
Yeah, I go to Carlton.

00:13.697 --> 00:15.756
Oh, you talk! Great!

00:18.951 --> 00:20.460
Turn around, put your
hands on your head, now.

00:20.484 --> 00:22.431
You're hurting my pitching arm!

00:22.468 --> 00:24.151
Nosebleeds plus that bruise...

00:24.170 --> 00:27.085
I think someone on the
baseball team is using steroids.

00:27.100 --> 00:29.528
I'm using because a
cop tried to arrest me,

00:29.567 --> 00:31.214
and he strained my rotator cuff.

00:31.243 --> 00:33.755
My dad's gonna yell and
lecture, and that's it.

00:33.780 --> 00:35.957
Your mom ordered a mandatory drug test

00:35.987 --> 00:38.542
for the whole team. My life is over!

00:52.101 --> 00:53.131
What happened here?

00:54.272 --> 00:56.110
A little bit?

00:56.173 --> 00:58.047
When I went to bed,

00:58.167 --> 01:00.253
this place was a disaster zone.

01:00.288 --> 01:02.425
Now you could eat off the floor.

01:02.545 --> 01:04.676
God, I love you.

01:04.796 --> 01:06.559
And to prove it,

01:06.679 --> 01:09.739
I'm gonna take you
out for dinner tonight.

01:09.859 --> 01:11.459
With my salary, of course,

01:11.494 --> 01:14.467
it's gonna be the food
truck of your choice.

01:18.635 --> 01:20.739
I thought Melody was out of town.

01:26.816 --> 01:30.140
Wow, I didn't know that
you two had been talking.

01:36.958 --> 01:38.222
That's great.

01:43.643 --> 01:44.931
Oh!

01:46.997 --> 01:49.241
Travis! Are you kidding?

01:49.518 --> 01:53.395
I would love to meet your mom.

02:04.754 --> 02:06.819
The health center?

02:08.201 --> 02:10.359
Good. Have a seat, thank
you. That's him, yeah.

02:10.389 --> 02:14.104
Hey, man. Good. Thank
you very much. Uh, yes.

02:14.224 --> 02:17.384
Uh, a random drug test.

02:17.414 --> 02:20.141
So, check him in. And
just, uh, grab a seat.

02:25.424 --> 02:27.060
We couldn't do nothing.

02:27.180 --> 02:29.709
I'm hoping you're wrong about all this.

02:30.285 --> 02:31.765
Ah, hi.

02:31.768 --> 02:34.410
Dr. Taylor, this is my daughter Daphne.

02:34.426 --> 02:36.361
She is a student volunteer.

02:36.384 --> 02:38.112
She'll be checking in
all of the athletes.

02:38.232 --> 02:40.394
- Nice to meet you.
- Likewise.

02:40.633 --> 02:43.085
Dr. Taylor is from True Quest Labs.

02:43.115 --> 02:44.559
He'll be administering the test

02:44.590 --> 02:47.288
to all of the sports
teams in the next two days.

02:47.319 --> 02:48.996
What I'll need from
you is pretty simple.

02:49.057 --> 02:50.445
After you log in the players,

02:50.465 --> 02:52.922
just mark and track their
samples prior to my testing.

02:52.953 --> 02:54.808
It's a lot of athletes, so
we need to stay organized.

02:54.857 --> 02:56.136
- Okay?
- Got it.

02:56.171 --> 02:57.892
Are all of the baseball
players accounted for?

02:57.898 --> 03:01.142
- Uh, I...
- It looks like everyone

03:01.176 --> 03:04.773
- except Chris Walker.
- Ooh, Chris? He called me.

03:04.810 --> 03:06.843
He's been throwing up. I think he's got,

03:06.880 --> 03:08.361
you know, stomach flu.

03:08.481 --> 03:10.916
Then he won't mind coming
to the health center.

03:11.254 --> 03:13.400
He's got 48 hours.

03:13.520 --> 03:14.954
- Okay?
- Okay.

03:14.989 --> 03:16.244
Bye.

03:24.563 --> 03:25.958
Chris.

03:28.981 --> 03:31.058
Stomach flu? Really?

03:31.119 --> 03:34.633
Trust me, I feel pretty
sick to my stomach right now.

03:34.658 --> 03:37.250
So you just skipped the
test? What are you thinking?

03:41.016 --> 03:44.735
What I was thinking is that if
I walked in there this morning,

03:44.772 --> 03:47.114
- I would have failed.
- You should have thought of that

03:47.157 --> 03:48.631
before you started taking steroids.

03:48.668 --> 03:51.027
Look, I stopped taking them, okay?

03:51.071 --> 03:52.895
I know what I did was wrong.

03:53.190 --> 03:54.782
The problem is...

03:55.102 --> 03:57.336
the drugs won't be out
of my system for a week.

03:57.372 --> 03:59.686
- I just need time.
- Well, you don't have any.

03:59.806 --> 04:02.268
If you don't take the
test in the next 48 hours,

04:02.305 --> 04:04.807
you're gonna be in huge trouble.
They're gonna kick you off the team.

04:04.831 --> 04:06.411
Forty-eight hours?

04:06.531 --> 04:07.965
How do you know that?

04:08.085 --> 04:10.011
I work in the health center, remember?

04:11.185 --> 04:13.765
Of course. You can help me.

04:13.826 --> 04:16.474
- Chris...
- You know why I did what I did.

04:16.529 --> 04:19.673
It's because of the injury,
because of what that cop did to me.

04:19.793 --> 04:23.670
If I fail this test, I will
never get a look with the Royals.

04:23.713 --> 04:25.390
My baseball career will be over.

04:25.408 --> 04:27.454
I can't get you out of taking the test.

04:27.485 --> 04:29.200
It doesn't work like that.

04:29.507 --> 04:31.295
That's not what I'm saying.

04:33.654 --> 04:35.645
I need you to help me cheat.

04:44.794 --> 04:48.327

04:51.742 --> 04:53.886
Come in. Shut the door.

04:59.348 --> 05:02.770
Hey, how's your hand? Okay?

05:09.722 --> 05:12.606
When you hit Aidan McManus?

05:15.560 --> 05:17.348
Damn it, Travis!

05:17.379 --> 05:19.222
How many times do we got to do this?

05:19.253 --> 05:20.911
I had to bench you last month

05:20.954 --> 05:22.889
for fighting with your own teammate.

05:24.395 --> 05:27.669
Aidan's filed a complaint
with the athletic department.

05:29.450 --> 05:34.897
It doesn't matter. You're aware
of the UMKC code of conduct, right?

05:37.772 --> 05:41.434
That may be, but violence
is never the answer.

05:42.399 --> 05:44.808
Now, John is your
coach. I'm gonna let him

05:44.826 --> 05:46.934
decide what to do with you.

05:47.413 --> 05:51.093
Two weekends, campus work detail.

05:51.213 --> 05:52.967
Okay, do you want three?

05:54.920 --> 05:56.806
Okay. You can go.

06:04.886 --> 06:06.748
You know, Toby saw the whole thing.

06:06.815 --> 06:10.151
That kid, he was walking
around calling people retarded.

06:10.213 --> 06:13.376
- I probably would've hit him myself.
- Yeah.

06:13.394 --> 06:16.006
- Well, at least it's over now, right?
- I'm not so sure.

06:16.037 --> 06:18.796
Aidan McManus is the
son of Leonard McManus.

06:18.832 --> 06:21.308
- The lawyer?
- The ambulance chaser.

06:21.428 --> 06:23.397
I've seen that guy's TV commercials:

06:23.434 --> 06:26.648
- "getevengetpaid.com."
- That's the guy.

06:26.863 --> 06:29.954
He called my office. He
wants to set a meeting.

06:31.189 --> 06:35.844
So are we talking, like, Fort
Knox level of impenetrability

06:35.867 --> 06:38.156
or more like a glorified
nanny-cam situation?

06:38.202 --> 06:40.114
Um, somewhere in between.

06:40.153 --> 06:42.816
Uh, there's been a few break-ins
in the neighborhood lately.

06:42.866 --> 06:44.113
When I started this business,

06:44.144 --> 06:45.931
I had a big muscle-bound
partner in Eric,

06:45.950 --> 06:47.504
but now that it's just me,

06:47.541 --> 06:50.293
a security system would
make me feel a little safer.

06:50.413 --> 06:52.831
What about your bad-ass
Special Forces boyfriend?

06:52.849 --> 06:55.246
He's in Cabo right now
with his Army buddies.

06:55.264 --> 06:58.464
- That's why I asked you.
- Well, I think I found the perfect system.

06:58.476 --> 06:59.766
I can install it tomorrow,

06:59.779 --> 07:01.622
but it's gonna take me
the better part of the day.

07:01.659 --> 07:04.073
Plus, it's gonna get kind
of noisy and dusty in here.

07:04.193 --> 07:05.812
Well....

07:05.861 --> 07:08.159
I've been postponing
inventory for weeks now.

07:08.196 --> 07:09.504
So I could just close up and

07:09.535 --> 07:11.667
- kill two birds with one stone.
- Let's do it.

07:12.287 --> 07:15.150
I'm gonna owe you like
a lifetime of coffee.

07:21.249 --> 07:23.792
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:24.776 --> 07:27.448
So did you think about what I said?

07:27.568 --> 07:29.432
I'm not gonna help you cheat.

07:32.996 --> 07:35.745
But if you've stopped taking the drug,

07:35.788 --> 07:38.301
there's a chance I could
help you pass the test.

07:42.651 --> 07:44.205
What drug were you taking?

07:44.506 --> 07:46.226
Colibuterol.

07:47.031 --> 07:50.404
- In what dose?
- 75 micro-grams, once a day.

07:50.447 --> 07:52.499
- And you weigh?
- 190.

07:52.511 --> 07:56.529
- Time of your last dose?
- Uh, three days ago, around 9:00 a.m.

07:57.629 --> 08:00.553
It'll be tight and I can't
guarantee a hundred percent

08:00.584 --> 08:02.433
that this will work,
but there's a chance.

08:02.553 --> 08:06.918
- You just have to do exactly what I say.
- Yeah, yeah, anything.

08:10.196 --> 08:13.063
- Hey!
- Hi, come in, come on in.

08:13.183 --> 08:16.471
Oh, hi, honey. Oh.

08:16.651 --> 08:19.336
- And you must be Bay.
- I am!

08:19.385 --> 08:20.626
- Hi!
- Hi!

08:20.650 --> 08:22.973
Oh, it is so nice to meet you.

08:23.004 --> 08:25.745
- I made artichoke dip.
- Oh, I love artichoke dip.

08:26.236 --> 08:27.729
Um, gosh...

08:27.760 --> 08:31.273
I am so happy that you made it.

08:31.323 --> 08:35.371
I... I wanted to meet the girl

08:35.491 --> 08:39.395
that my son went all
the way to China for.

08:39.515 --> 08:41.176
This is China.

08:42.607 --> 08:44.094
China.

08:44.340 --> 08:45.938
- Got it.
- That was perfect.

08:53.648 --> 08:55.780
He says your signing's great.

08:56.063 --> 08:57.777
Thanks.

08:58.385 --> 09:00.726
But I am glad that you're here.

09:00.762 --> 09:02.477
It just makes it easier.

09:02.597 --> 09:05.671
Hmm.

09:06.342 --> 09:08.750
Hey! They're here!

09:08.928 --> 09:11.650
Oh, I've got a surprise
for you. Eddie's here.

09:11.699 --> 09:14.378
This is my brother.
Travis's favorite uncle.

09:14.409 --> 09:16.183
Travis.

09:16.872 --> 09:18.819
Good to see you, pal.

09:18.939 --> 09:20.687
Eddie, this is Bay.

09:20.718 --> 09:23.980
- This is Travis's girlfriend.
- Wow!

09:24.100 --> 09:26.389
- I always knew this kid had good taste.
- Mm-hmm.

09:26.395 --> 09:29.258
- Uh, I hope you don't mind me crashing dinner.
- Oh, of course not.

09:29.283 --> 09:31.704
- The more, the merrier.
- Should we open a bottle of wine?

09:31.728 --> 09:33.852
- Celebrate the reunion?
- Uh, yeah.

09:33.871 --> 09:35.659
Come on, I'll find one and...

09:35.779 --> 09:38.454
you guys just make
yourselves comfortable.

09:39.837 --> 09:43.775
Wow, your mom is so sweet.

09:47.854 --> 09:49.526
Are you okay?

10:44.110 --> 10:46.199
Hey, come on over, guys!

10:46.709 --> 10:48.644
I made Travis's favorite.

10:48.656 --> 10:51.790
- It's honey-baked
chicken. - Just one second.

11:08.864 --> 11:10.062
Phew!

11:10.289 --> 11:11.831
Girl, you can run.

11:11.862 --> 11:14.018
I'm more of a "walk
out to the mound... "

11:14.037 --> 11:15.357
"... and do my thing" kind of guy.

11:15.477 --> 11:17.766
Well, this is all about
speeding up your metabolism.

11:18.043 --> 11:20.353
Those two gallons of
water I had you drink,

11:20.473 --> 11:22.873
we need you to sweat all of that out,

11:22.993 --> 11:25.413
and then we'll replenish
your vitamin levels

11:25.414 --> 11:29.270
- to normalize your glucose readings.
- Man, you really know your stuff.

11:29.286 --> 11:31.812
Ah, it's just basic human physiology.

11:31.932 --> 11:33.732
Today's about flushing your system,

11:33.756 --> 11:35.389
and tomorrow we build it back up.

11:35.424 --> 11:37.401
We need to boost your creatine levels,

11:37.432 --> 11:39.545
so that means lots of red meat.

11:39.588 --> 11:43.046
Well, that I got. I know
where to find the best barbecue

11:43.069 --> 11:45.035
in Kansas City. You're gonna love it.

11:45.396 --> 11:48.689
- Actually, I'm a vegetarian.
- Seriously?

11:48.809 --> 11:51.147
Uh, okay, then, uh,
you'll just have to make do

11:51.155 --> 11:54.777
- with the best okra and baked beans ever.
- Sounds perfect.

11:55.430 --> 11:58.625
- Hi.
- On me, of course.

11:58.648 --> 12:01.060
I will have an extra large mango

12:01.083 --> 12:04.300
and whatever this beautiful,
young genius is having.

12:09.261 --> 12:11.741
Do you remember when
he ate an entire jar

12:11.741 --> 12:13.615
of peanut butter in one sitting?

12:13.814 --> 12:18.095
Oh, he was like a human
garbage disposal back then.

12:18.123 --> 12:21.349
He was such a troublemaker.

12:23.514 --> 12:27.876
Karen, you have to see
him pitch. He's amazing.

12:28.469 --> 12:30.941
Oh, I'd love to come see a game.

12:31.356 --> 12:34.944
Uh, well, you can't though,
'cause the season's over.

12:34.967 --> 12:38.248
Oh, this is so nice, just

12:38.283 --> 12:41.787
- having us all together again.
- Yeah.

12:44.844 --> 12:48.499
My relationship with, uh, Travis's dad,

12:48.499 --> 12:50.290
it was always, um...

12:50.558 --> 12:53.244
a little rocky. And

12:53.364 --> 12:58.552
Eddie was more of a father
to Travis than my ex was.

12:58.884 --> 13:01.065
Now, let's not insult the kid's dad.

13:01.095 --> 13:02.865
Oh, you're right. You're right.

13:02.889 --> 13:06.250
But we were always so grateful
that you were there for us.

13:06.299 --> 13:08.744
He used to come visit every Christmas,

13:08.775 --> 13:12.989
and he would always bring
Travis those model-airplane kits.

13:13.109 --> 13:15.751
And you guys would put
them together in the garage.

13:15.782 --> 13:17.373
Do you remember that, honey?

13:20.409 --> 13:22.762
Did you ask him if he remembered that?

13:26.632 --> 13:28.851
Hey, honey.

13:30.841 --> 13:32.555
Are you okay?

13:32.979 --> 13:35.209
Hey, you haven't touched your food.

13:36.899 --> 13:39.402
You know what? If you don't...
If you don't like the chicken,

13:39.433 --> 13:41.633
I can make you something else.

13:45.995 --> 13:47.789
Um, you know what?

13:48.041 --> 13:50.947
It's getting late,
actually. We should go.

13:51.144 --> 13:55.113
But I made Mississippi mud for dessert.

13:55.555 --> 13:58.096
It's just I have to wake up at the, uh,

13:58.103 --> 14:01.683
crack of dawn for work
tomorrow, so, uh...

14:01.936 --> 14:05.327
- At a tattoo parlor?
- Uh, yeah, you'd be surprised

14:05.370 --> 14:08.678
how many people want to get
inked first thing in the morning.

14:08.732 --> 14:11.028
Oh, okay.

14:11.451 --> 14:13.158
Travis?

14:21.457 --> 14:23.208
Stop.

14:23.328 --> 14:26.257
It... It was great to meet you.

14:26.377 --> 14:27.955
You too.

14:31.964 --> 14:34.076
Bye, honey.

14:46.488 --> 14:49.145
Leonard, I am so glad you came by.

14:49.145 --> 14:50.765
I wanted to thank you in person.

14:50.796 --> 14:54.175
We used your last donation to
re-turf the entire football field.

14:54.198 --> 14:55.895
Ah, I'm so glad. I had
some of the best memories

14:55.914 --> 14:57.431
of my life on that field.

14:57.551 --> 15:00.829
Yes, and I wanted to
tell you how sorry we are

15:00.860 --> 15:02.844
about what happened to Aidan.

15:04.245 --> 15:06.998
We are disciplining
the player in question.

15:07.035 --> 15:09.671
We've given him two consecutive
weekends on work detail

15:09.708 --> 15:11.404
and a serious reprimand.

15:11.524 --> 15:12.988
I hardly think that's enough punishment

15:13.007 --> 15:15.798
- for a guy who attacked my son.
- Attack?

15:16.456 --> 15:18.932
I think that's a bit
of an overstatement.

15:18.963 --> 15:19.952
Do you?

15:20.007 --> 15:21.383
This wouldn't have
anything to do with the fact

15:21.416 --> 15:22.870
that your daughter happens to be dating

15:22.888 --> 15:25.418
- the player in question, would it?
- Not at all.

15:26.733 --> 15:28.454
I think it's a fair punishment.

15:28.574 --> 15:30.389
His jaw is broken.

15:30.850 --> 15:31.889
Really?

15:31.925 --> 15:35.015
His mouth is wired shut. He
won't be able to speak for weeks.

15:35.028 --> 15:36.923
I ought to be suing
the pants off this kid.

15:37.916 --> 15:39.831
I understand that you're angry,

15:40.531 --> 15:42.093
but I tell you that
there is no money there.

15:42.108 --> 15:43.778
And I think that we should
handle this internally

15:43.798 --> 15:45.455
for the good of the school.

15:47.691 --> 15:49.205
Actually, I agree with you.

15:50.227 --> 15:52.223
You know how much I care
about the athletic department.

15:52.257 --> 15:53.973
I've been very loyal with my checkbook.

15:53.973 --> 15:55.522
You certainly have.

15:56.372 --> 15:57.537
Bottom line:

15:57.802 --> 16:00.889
I don't think Travis Barnes
is worthy of our fine program.

16:02.457 --> 16:04.345
What exactly are you saying?

16:04.419 --> 16:06.429
Either that kid's off the baseball team

16:06.443 --> 16:08.410
or I'm taking my money elsewhere.

16:10.991 --> 16:13.556
How could he just sit
there across from you

16:13.581 --> 16:16.107
and pretend like it never happened?

16:24.031 --> 16:27.501
The thought of your mom
still being there with him,

16:27.668 --> 16:30.391
not knowing who he really is...

16:30.445 --> 16:32.386
Travis, you have to tell her!

16:33.742 --> 16:36.445
She has to know. It's just gonna keep

16:36.453 --> 16:39.385
coming up every time you see him.

16:45.751 --> 16:47.692
But you were so excited about it.

16:47.812 --> 16:51.241
And what? You're just gonna throw
that all away just to protect him?

16:59.570 --> 17:02.956
At least then she would know the truth.

17:03.015 --> 17:05.660
What don't I get?

17:11.721 --> 17:13.023
Oh, Travis.

17:13.064 --> 17:15.060
We will make her believe you.

17:19.813 --> 17:20.939
Okay.

17:21.627 --> 17:24.689
Look, I'm not gonna make you do anything

17:24.713 --> 17:26.714
that you do not want to do, okay?

17:32.252 --> 17:33.953
All right, um...

17:34.425 --> 17:35.585
Hey.

17:36.597 --> 17:38.160
I can stay here tonight.

17:43.169 --> 17:44.373
Okay.

18:16.553 --> 18:19.511
This is the best fried
okra I've ever tasted.

18:19.534 --> 18:21.564
And the corn bread, oh my God!

18:21.684 --> 18:24.986
I'm telling you, if you had a
little taste of these beef ribs,

18:25.039 --> 18:27.102
you'd give up being vegetarian forever.

18:27.286 --> 18:29.005
He's right about that, honey.

18:30.661 --> 18:33.306
For real, Aunt Mae should've
had her own restaurant.

18:33.335 --> 18:36.018
That's 'cause she's the best
damn cook west of the Mississippi.

18:36.095 --> 18:38.647
- Aren't you, Mae Mae? Hmm?
- Chris!

18:38.913 --> 18:41.054
Well, I need to get this recipe.

18:41.174 --> 18:42.479
Hmm, I don't know.

18:42.527 --> 18:45.110
I don't give that recipe
out to just anybody.

18:45.461 --> 18:48.898
But I might make an exception
for the girl Chris is sweet on.

18:50.602 --> 18:53.338
- Oh, we're just friends.
- Mm-hmm.

18:53.396 --> 18:56.257
I know a budding romance when I see it.

18:57.380 --> 19:00.011
I'm just helping Chris
with some training.

19:00.131 --> 19:02.939
Daphne's dad is my coach, Coach K.

19:02.978 --> 19:05.330
He's the one getting us
our look with the Royals.

19:05.339 --> 19:06.789
Is that right?

19:06.823 --> 19:08.988
Oh, well, thank your daddy for me.

19:08.997 --> 19:12.303
It would be great if Chris
could play ball nearby

19:12.342 --> 19:15.716
and be here to raise his little
brother Taylor when I'm gone.

19:16.027 --> 19:18.158
You're not going anywhere.

19:22.017 --> 19:25.171
I've watched Chris play the
game since he was little,

19:25.291 --> 19:28.458
and I've watched him grow
into a fine young man.

19:29.509 --> 19:31.616
He didn't have a lot growing up,

19:31.784 --> 19:33.627
but I did the best I could.

19:34.933 --> 19:36.613
You did great.

19:37.496 --> 19:40.534
And I always told
him, if he worked hard,

19:40.654 --> 19:43.275
he could achieve whatever he wanted.

19:44.557 --> 19:46.045
And one day, he'll go on

19:46.073 --> 19:48.617
and inspire a lot of
kids to do the same.

19:54.708 --> 19:57.170
Come on. Let's get you home.

19:57.392 --> 20:00.632
I don't want to tire you out
bragging about me all day.

20:01.436 --> 20:04.844
But I like it. Give me some sugar.

20:06.518 --> 20:07.952
Sweetheart.

20:09.554 --> 20:13.219
- No way, I am not cutting Travis!
- Leonard McManus donates

20:13.249 --> 20:17.532
- $200,000 a year to the athletic department.
- I don't care.

20:17.539 --> 20:20.414
It is my team and I
decide who's on the roster!

20:20.450 --> 20:22.058
We are in the middle of a budget crisis!

20:22.082 --> 20:24.092
- We need that money!
- Well, we'll find the money elsewhere.

20:24.140 --> 20:26.900
No, we won't. The days when
you and I could pitch in

20:26.912 --> 20:28.910
to make up for a
shortfall are long gone.

20:28.928 --> 20:30.842
Besides, Mike Chapman
didn't even skip a beat.

20:30.890 --> 20:33.668
- He wants Travis out!
- Did you at least fight back?

20:33.698 --> 20:35.426
Of course I did,

20:35.894 --> 20:37.964
but he knows Travis's
history. And frankly,

20:38.040 --> 20:39.173
I see his point.

20:39.226 --> 20:41.309
It's not fair to the rest
of the athletes to suffer

20:41.347 --> 20:43.949
just because one kid
can't control his temper!

20:43.982 --> 20:45.494
I'm talking to Mike.

20:46.266 --> 20:48.892
No, you're not and that's
not open for discussion.

20:48.935 --> 20:50.135
Oh, really?

20:51.535 --> 20:53.922
I know how you feel about Travis.

20:54.203 --> 20:56.836
He's the reason you're coaching
in the first place, so...

20:57.239 --> 21:00.163
if you want me to be the
one to tell him, I will.

21:02.083 --> 21:04.695
No, it should be me.

21:10.676 --> 21:12.318
Well, that's about it.

21:14.367 --> 21:16.737
Okay, I'm just about finished up here,

21:16.857 --> 21:19.637
but I'm short a co-ax cable.
I need to run a few errands.

21:19.675 --> 21:21.172
You cool with me being
gone for a couple hours?

21:21.182 --> 21:22.319
- No problem.
- Cool.

21:22.353 --> 21:24.153
- I'll definitely finish tonight.
- I'll be here.

21:24.210 --> 21:25.814
All right then. See ya.

21:26.840 --> 21:28.352
Just sign right here.

21:31.506 --> 21:32.878
It's gonna be okay.

21:36.714 --> 21:38.116
I hope you're right.

21:38.471 --> 21:40.564
I'm proud of you for
doing this the right way.

21:40.617 --> 21:41.740
This is good.

21:41.970 --> 21:45.499
I'm sorry for getting you
involved in all of this, but

21:45.551 --> 21:46.665
thank you.

21:47.227 --> 21:50.063
I'll let you know as soon
as I hear anything. Promise.

21:56.107 --> 21:57.537
How's it coming?

21:58.030 --> 22:00.664
All good. Um, we have
the girls' swim team

22:00.664 --> 22:02.782
- this afternoon and then we're all done.
- Excellent.

22:02.848 --> 22:04.900
I'm about halfway through
the samples we've collected,

22:04.938 --> 22:06.287
just get the rest to me when you can.

22:06.325 --> 22:08.586
Will do. Um, how's it going so far?

22:08.629 --> 22:10.136
Anything unusual come up?

22:10.198 --> 22:13.405
Nope, all clear. No PEDs
and nothing to suggest

22:13.444 --> 22:15.940
- anyone's trying to game the test.
- Game the test?

22:15.997 --> 22:17.701
Well, you'd be surprised
at the lengths some athletes

22:17.706 --> 22:19.357
would go to mask their results.

22:19.938 --> 22:21.843
- Really?
- There are methods that can work.

22:21.853 --> 22:24.075
You know, like a special diet,

22:24.084 --> 22:25.491
intense use of diuretics,

22:25.515 --> 22:27.157
but I have ways of finding all that.

22:27.373 --> 22:28.501
- You do?
- Sure.

22:28.535 --> 22:29.907
If I suspect any of
that stuff's been done,

22:29.931 --> 22:31.141
I'll just order a blood test.

22:31.174 --> 22:32.854
That's conclusive. No way around it.

22:33.416 --> 22:35.163
That's really interesting.

22:35.183 --> 22:36.887
It's a science. We've got it down.

22:48.762 --> 22:50.821
Toby, you back already?

22:57.843 --> 22:59.077
Toby?

23:02.005 --> 23:04.136
Toby, is that you?

23:11.414 --> 23:12.705
I have a gun!

23:12.758 --> 23:14.558
I'm calling 9-1-1!

23:19.910 --> 23:21.638
Since when did you get a gun?

23:25.531 --> 23:26.808
Oh my God!

23:27.226 --> 23:28.358
Eric!

23:33.327 --> 23:35.208
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

23:35.237 --> 23:36.840
It wouldn't have been
smart of me to contact you.

23:36.845 --> 23:39.472
But where's Will? Is
he okay? Are you okay?

23:39.496 --> 23:41.372
We're fine. Me and Will have been

23:41.425 --> 23:43.840
bouncing around a lot
over the last year:

23:44.065 --> 23:46.580
Portland, Salt Lake, Boulder.

23:46.955 --> 23:49.336
I almost broke down and
called you a million times.

23:50.305 --> 23:51.673
I wish you had.

23:52.796 --> 23:55.568
- But why are you here now?
- I'm tired of running.

23:55.756 --> 23:58.629
I'm tired of changing our identities,

23:58.667 --> 24:00.824
never settling down.

24:00.860 --> 24:02.521
And it's not right for Will.

24:02.577 --> 24:04.324
I mean, he's getting older,
and he's asking me questions

24:04.348 --> 24:06.509
that I can't answer. Look,
I have to put a stop to this.

24:06.551 --> 24:08.252
But if Hope finds you...

24:08.267 --> 24:10.771
Hope's in jail, parole violation.

24:11.486 --> 24:13.885
The police are still looking
for me, but I found a guy.

24:13.939 --> 24:15.805
He can help me and Will
get out of the country.

24:15.840 --> 24:18.168
It's not cheap, but he can
give me everything that we need:

24:18.212 --> 24:21.178
uh, new identities, citizenship,
a business, everything...

24:22.734 --> 24:24.524
a whole new life.

24:25.364 --> 24:28.499
So, why did you come back?

24:29.372 --> 24:31.230
I left something here.

24:35.338 --> 24:37.263
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

24:39.749 --> 24:43.542
Travis, I'm sorry,
but my hands are tied,

24:43.801 --> 24:47.209
and getting angry about it
is not gonna help anything.

24:56.436 --> 24:58.101
Uh, Travis,

24:58.605 --> 25:00.501
can I give you a little advice?

25:00.554 --> 25:04.140
Whatever this is that
is making you so angry,

25:04.471 --> 25:07.620
you have got to get
to the bottom of that.

25:08.968 --> 25:13.241
Otherwise, it is just gonna
keep messing up your life.

25:30.425 --> 25:31.634
Oh no.

25:31.754 --> 25:34.596
Yeah, I led him to believe
that he's gonna pass,

25:34.620 --> 25:38.043
and now he's gonna get caught for sure.

25:38.163 --> 25:40.112
Everyone involved in the protest

25:40.131 --> 25:41.791
has moved on with their lives,

25:41.815 --> 25:45.655
but Chris made the biggest
sacrifice of them all and now

25:45.708 --> 25:47.297
it's gonna cost him everything.

25:47.306 --> 25:48.905
It does sound pretty unfair.

25:50.441 --> 25:52.610
There is one thing I could do.

25:52.644 --> 25:55.208
I'm in charge of

25:55.477 --> 25:58.112
all the drug test samples.

25:58.612 --> 26:02.451
But it's wrong helping
someone cheat, right?

26:02.931 --> 26:04.870
Is it cheating to help someone

26:04.884 --> 26:07.990
who doesn't ever get a
fair shake to begin with?

26:08.681 --> 26:10.418
- What do you mean?
- You didn't see

26:10.433 --> 26:12.074
when they pinned him down

26:12.093 --> 26:15.064
for trying to steal his own bike.

26:15.184 --> 26:17.043
I know that, but am I crazy

26:17.057 --> 26:19.334
for thinking about
crossing the line for him.

26:20.273 --> 26:22.755
Maybe I'm the wrong person to ask.

26:23.081 --> 26:25.797
When you're medical
career was on the line,

26:25.980 --> 26:28.943
I took the bullet for you.

26:30.181 --> 26:34.180
I didn't even hesitate, and I
would do it again in a second.

26:40.659 --> 26:44.029
- Hi.
- Hi, I hope I'm not intruding.

26:45.080 --> 26:47.230
Hey, um, I'm Daphne.

26:47.274 --> 26:50.245
I remember. Nice to see you again.

26:53.297 --> 26:56.312
Um, I have to get back to the
health center. I'll see you.

26:56.374 --> 26:58.790
- It was nice to see you again.
- You too.

27:01.466 --> 27:04.834
Sorry to drop in like
this, but I just...

27:05.080 --> 27:07.999
I just don't know what
happened last night.

27:08.035 --> 27:11.380
I was so excited to finally
reconnect with Travis,

27:11.428 --> 27:14.497
and we were having such
a good time, and he just...

27:15.466 --> 27:16.874
shut down.

27:17.367 --> 27:19.138
I don't know if it was something that

27:19.258 --> 27:22.213
I said or something that I did.

27:24.245 --> 27:26.316
I'm sorry. I... I... I can't.

27:27.935 --> 27:29.596
There is something going on.

27:29.630 --> 27:31.320
- It's just, it's really not my place.
- Look,

27:31.356 --> 27:34.617
I know that he has Melody, and I'm...

27:34.800 --> 27:36.998
I'm happy,

27:37.829 --> 27:39.321
but I'm his mom.

27:39.576 --> 27:41.707
I'm his real mom,

27:41.995 --> 27:45.149
and I missed all that
time with him, and I'm...

27:45.572 --> 27:48.361
I'm trying to make up for it.

27:49.177 --> 27:50.882
I know my signing wasn't

27:50.896 --> 27:53.382
very good last night. I was just

27:53.502 --> 27:56.440
- so nervous.
- Oh no, no. It was not that at all.

27:57.707 --> 28:00.495
Then will you...

28:01.787 --> 28:03.160
talk to him

28:03.606 --> 28:05.541
and ask him to tell me?

28:06.385 --> 28:08.252
please, whatever it is...

28:10.177 --> 28:11.785
I just want to know.

28:31.980 --> 28:34.486
That's been in my daughter's
apartment this whole time?

28:34.510 --> 28:36.223
Why didn't you tell me?

28:36.708 --> 28:38.042
I didn't want to get you in trouble.

28:43.481 --> 28:45.391
That is a lot of money.

28:45.426 --> 28:47.714
This buys me and Will a new life.

28:48.271 --> 28:50.345
I want it to include you.

28:50.465 --> 28:53.299
Look, I've got a little
cafe picked out in Belize.

28:53.816 --> 28:55.285
I can't.

28:55.669 --> 28:58.621
We could live the life
we've always wanted.

28:59.419 --> 29:00.542
Come with me.

29:00.787 --> 29:02.573
I can't.

29:12.878 --> 29:15.998
Come... with me.

29:34.021 --> 29:35.077
Wait.

29:35.298 --> 29:36.609
Wait.

29:38.696 --> 29:40.237
I can't do this.

29:41.326 --> 29:43.069
I can't do this.

30:02.764 --> 30:05.476
Your mom came to see
me at the tattoo parlor.

30:07.697 --> 30:09.315
Because.

30:09.560 --> 30:11.628
She knows that something's wrong,

30:11.924 --> 30:13.991
but she doesn't know what.

30:16.034 --> 30:19.545
You said that she will be devastated

30:19.665 --> 30:21.166
if you tell her...

30:21.667 --> 30:24.239
but she is devastated right now.

30:31.353 --> 30:33.398
Travis, you have to face this.

30:34.392 --> 30:37.387
All this other stuff
that you've been doing,

30:37.507 --> 30:40.727
it's not working anymore.

30:52.895 --> 30:53.956
I'll come.

30:54.267 --> 30:55.525
I'll interpret.

31:04.064 --> 31:07.328
I will be with you the whole time.

31:18.306 --> 31:19.571
Thanks.

31:44.961 --> 31:46.396
Dr. Taylor.

31:47.073 --> 31:49.925
You're gonna kill me.
I made a big mistake.

31:49.968 --> 31:52.992
I dropped one of the
samples. I'm so sorry.

31:53.031 --> 31:54.936
It's okay. Accidents happen.

31:55.056 --> 31:56.530
It's Friday, so have the nurse

31:56.559 --> 31:58.023
call the student whose sample was ruined

31:58.028 --> 31:59.319
and let them know they
need to get in here

31:59.347 --> 32:01.052
first thing Monday for a re-screen.

32:09.283 --> 32:11.141
Give Will a kiss for me.

32:11.371 --> 32:12.413
Yeah.

32:13.882 --> 32:16.364
Look, I wasn't just
coming back for the money.

32:17.439 --> 32:19.143
I had to try.

32:19.969 --> 32:21.298
I know.

32:21.572 --> 32:23.578
And once I'm gone, I can't come back.

32:25.162 --> 32:26.372
I understand.

32:27.563 --> 32:29.342
I hope you do too.

32:59.635 --> 33:02.755
It's gonna take 48 hours for
us to get our new passports.

33:03.631 --> 33:06.307
I'll be at the Platte City
Motel out by the airport...

33:07.411 --> 33:09.271
if you change your mind.

33:10.081 --> 33:11.293
I won't.

33:28.327 --> 33:30.211
Eddie isn't gay.

33:30.745 --> 33:32.605
He was married.

33:36.493 --> 33:37.363
It's true.

33:39.097 --> 33:41.491
Maybe you're remembering it wrong.

33:45.619 --> 33:49.885
It was the Christmas
during that big snow storm,

33:50.005 --> 33:51.985
and the power went out.

33:52.279 --> 33:53.941
You went to the grocery store

33:53.953 --> 33:56.107
because all the food
in the fridge went bad.

33:58.723 --> 34:01.123
- And he took me into the garage.
- No!

34:01.193 --> 34:04.667
Stop. Really, I don't want
to hear anymore of this.

34:05.373 --> 34:06.976
He's not making this up.

34:07.096 --> 34:09.764
Then why didn't you
tell me this years ago?

34:12.242 --> 34:15.136
I couldn't tell you. You never saw it.

34:17.402 --> 34:20.100
And how could you not notice
how things changed between us

34:20.114 --> 34:21.746
whenever he was around?

34:22.851 --> 34:26.639
I just thought you were
being a... a teenager.

34:26.759 --> 34:28.726
You never talked to me!

34:28.731 --> 34:31.143
You were angry all of the time!

34:32.542 --> 34:33.911
That's why I was angry.

34:33.947 --> 34:36.089
Because you never learned my language.

34:36.094 --> 34:38.014
I've been trying.

34:39.103 --> 34:40.500
It's too late.

34:40.668 --> 34:42.094
I don't need it now.

34:42.388 --> 34:44.341
I needed it when I was 12.

34:49.438 --> 34:50.812
I was scared.

34:50.931 --> 34:52.293
I thought it was all my fault.

34:52.414 --> 34:54.032
I couldn't tell you...

34:55.389 --> 34:56.690
and Eddie knew that.

34:57.085 --> 34:58.933
And that's why he took advantage of me,

34:59.221 --> 35:02.518
because I was the deaf kid
who couldn't talk to his mom.

35:07.118 --> 35:08.707
I'm sorry!

35:08.980 --> 35:12.220
I... I'm so sorry.

35:15.994 --> 35:17.371
That's not good enough.

35:23.103 --> 35:24.835
Please help me.

35:25.464 --> 35:26.621
Please.

35:35.985 --> 35:39.602
I think what he needs to hear is that

35:39.653 --> 35:41.596
you believe him.

36:01.216 --> 36:03.060
I believe you.

36:05.647 --> 36:07.182
I believe you.

36:07.238 --> 36:08.866
I believe you!

36:19.850 --> 36:22.559
I have to take the test again? Why?

36:23.690 --> 36:26.707
Your test was compromised.

36:26.764 --> 36:29.036
They need you back in on Monday morning.

36:30.547 --> 36:33.088
By compromised you mean...

36:33.145 --> 36:35.039
I dropped it, accidentally.

36:35.555 --> 36:37.996
But what about the cleanse?

36:38.018 --> 36:39.335
I mean, everything we did?

36:39.399 --> 36:41.481
- I thought...
- They have a test for that too.

36:41.683 --> 36:43.267
You would've been flagged.

36:43.768 --> 36:45.576
I couldn't let that happen to you.

36:47.209 --> 36:50.562
And Monday will be seven
days since I stopped.

36:50.868 --> 36:52.191
I'll test clean!

36:53.320 --> 36:54.443
Thank you!

36:54.615 --> 36:55.902
Thank you!

36:57.629 --> 36:58.958
Whoa, whoa.

37:00.062 --> 37:01.900
That's not why I did this.

37:03.057 --> 37:05.304
Do you have any idea
how I feel right now,

37:05.326 --> 37:06.902
how hard that was for me to do?

37:06.936 --> 37:08.440
Yeah, I do,

37:09.199 --> 37:12.886
- and I really, really appreciate it.
- Do you?

37:13.541 --> 37:16.447
Because I don't feel very
good about myself right now.

37:16.836 --> 37:19.348
I cheated in a hospital.

37:19.516 --> 37:21.732
I want to be a doctor, that's my dream,

37:21.945 --> 37:24.431
and right now, I don't feel
like I deserve to be one.

37:24.551 --> 37:25.714
Hey.

37:26.617 --> 37:29.914
Hey, you helped somebody
who desperately needed it,

37:30.142 --> 37:32.792
even though it could
have cost you everything.

37:33.197 --> 37:34.657
That kind of doctor...

37:35.484 --> 37:38.052
That's the kind of doctor I want.

37:44.685 --> 37:45.846
Thank you.

37:47.837 --> 37:49.585
Just make sure you end up being the guy

37:49.600 --> 37:52.055
your Aunt Mae sees
when she looks at you.

37:53.514 --> 37:54.615
I promise...

37:55.075 --> 37:56.011
I will.

38:01.489 --> 38:03.005
- Hey.
- Hey.

38:03.125 --> 38:04.353
Well, you're all set.

38:04.383 --> 38:05.727
James Bond couldn't break in here

38:05.742 --> 38:07.408
without everyone knowing
it. Let me show you.

38:07.995 --> 38:09.047
This is so cool.

38:09.084 --> 38:11.814
So, it automatically takes a
screen grab every five seconds

38:11.844 --> 38:13.214
and saves it to your hard drive.

38:13.252 --> 38:15.232
Now if you want to go full screen,

38:15.247 --> 38:16.729
click on the cam that you want to see

38:16.751 --> 38:19.278
and scroll through the images like this.

38:19.570 --> 38:21.706
Wait, wait, wait!

38:26.902 --> 38:27.905
Oh.

38:30.185 --> 38:31.683
Can I ask you a question?

38:32.273 --> 38:33.153
Sure.

38:33.213 --> 38:35.896
If nothing happened between us,

38:35.945 --> 38:38.454
and there's no chance it ever will,

38:38.574 --> 38:40.681
do I need to tell Luca he was here?

38:43.295 --> 38:45.803
You know, when Lily
told me about Julian...

38:46.738 --> 38:47.940
it almost ruined us.

38:48.101 --> 38:50.314
And in the end, there was nothing there.

38:50.569 --> 38:52.665
Honestly, I kind of wish that...

38:53.798 --> 38:55.191
she had never told me.

38:55.535 --> 38:58.340
I think some things in life
are just better left unsaid.

38:59.005 --> 39:00.442
Thanks.

39:01.098 --> 39:04.619
Now, can you show me how to delete this?

39:10.024 --> 39:11.615
I am so proud of you.

39:14.535 --> 39:17.639
So do you think that
things will be easier

39:17.669 --> 39:19.772
between you and your mom?

39:26.457 --> 39:28.138
Yeah, I know.

39:28.604 --> 39:30.066
But, hey,

39:30.186 --> 39:33.839
Regina missed the first
16 years of my life,

39:33.851 --> 39:35.217
and look at us now.

39:35.715 --> 39:38.050
You can rebuild.

40:16.385 --> 40:17.332
Hey.

40:19.278 --> 40:21.834
Uh, you know what? Have a seat.

40:26.218 --> 40:27.737
So I, uh...

40:27.890 --> 40:30.443
I called a friend of mine
from the Royals days. He's a...

40:31.016 --> 40:34.112
he's a scout for a professional team.

40:38.503 --> 40:42.194
Well, they need a relief
pitcher with a really good curve.

40:42.274 --> 40:45.598
So, I sent them a video of you.

40:45.946 --> 40:47.339
And it turns out...

40:48.806 --> 40:50.153
they're interested.

40:52.313 --> 40:53.807
Yeah.

40:56.746 --> 40:59.003
Yeah, but no, there's
just one thing, okay?

40:59.040 --> 41:01.776
The team is in Tokyo.

41:01.840 --> 41:04.119
It's the Japanese league.

41:05.859 --> 41:06.777
Yeah.

41:06.949 --> 41:10.183
And, uh, they need you pitching...

41:10.565 --> 41:11.755
in a week.
