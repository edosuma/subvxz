06:02.667 --> 06:04.750
Shouldn't you be in bed?

06:07.625 --> 06:09.458
I have to finish my essay about Lvov.

06:09.542 --> 06:10.792
Uh-huh.

06:17.208 --> 06:18.792
Stasiu?

06:22.542 --> 06:24.667
I don't want to tell them that I'm Jewish.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.625
Well, then don't.

06:29.708 --> 06:32.042
There are wonderful things
to say about Lvov.

06:32.125 --> 06:35.000
Tell them about your brother,
a brilliant mathematician,

06:35.083 --> 06:37.875
and his friends from the Scottish cafÃ©.

06:40.625 --> 06:42.042
Cheer up.

06:42.125 --> 06:44.042
I don't like it here.

06:45.583 --> 06:47.208
I have a surprise for you.

06:48.417 --> 06:49.792
What surprise?

06:54.625 --> 06:56.583
From Stefka?

06:58.083 --> 07:00.000
-Oh, come on.
-Wait.

07:00.083 --> 07:01.375
Out loud, please.

07:01.458 --> 07:03.375
Okay, I'll read it aloud.

07:09.708 --> 07:11.417
Read it.

07:11.500 --> 07:14.208
"Dear brothers.

07:14.292 --> 07:17.958
"I hope you're both well and not
teasing each other too much.

07:18.042 --> 07:21.042
Stasio, I'm very proud of you.

07:21.125 --> 07:23.042
So are Mom and Dad.

07:23.125 --> 07:25.125
I'm sending the photo you asked for.

07:27.167 --> 07:30.750
Please thank Johnny
for his help with the bank.

07:30.833 --> 07:32.250
Dad is still working.

07:32.333 --> 07:34.167
Everything is fine in Lvov.

07:34.250 --> 07:37.417
The Russians don't do much,
they bring food and supplies.

07:37.500 --> 07:38.875
Also Mom is getting better.

07:38.958 --> 07:42.000
The new doctor is helping her a lot..."

07:48.125 --> 07:51.125
If everything's fine
why aren't they coming?

07:51.208 --> 07:53.167
Stefania will come.

07:53.250 --> 07:56.458
She told me so.
Mom also feels better.

07:57.375 --> 07:59.583
But we can't rush it.

08:01.708 --> 08:05.667
All you can do is work hard
at school and get good grades.

08:05.750 --> 08:07.042
Understand?

08:08.167 --> 08:09.458
Understand.

08:11.917 --> 08:13.292
Go to sleep.

16:29.917 --> 16:31.667
Stefka?

16:31.750 --> 16:33.292
How are you?

16:33.375 --> 16:35.458
It's so good to hear your voice again.

16:35.542 --> 16:37.625
How is Adam?

16:37.708 --> 16:40.542
He likes it here. It is all good.

16:40.625 --> 16:44.542
Tell me, how is my little nephew, Josi?

16:44.625 --> 16:47.000
He eats a lot, he's happiest then.

16:47.083 --> 16:48.958
A typical Ulam.

16:49.042 --> 16:51.083
Listen...

16:52.417 --> 16:55.208
I transferred more money since last time.

16:55.292 --> 16:57.917
Take our parents and go by train.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.667
I heard the Germans are close.
It's in every newspaper.

17:00.750 --> 17:02.458
You have to leave Lvov.

17:02.542 --> 17:04.041
I'll take care of it.

17:05.416 --> 17:07.625
I have to plan it.
I need to find a route.

17:09.416 --> 17:10.625
I don't know where to go.

17:10.708 --> 17:11.958
Don't take too long.

17:12.041 --> 17:14.750
Talk to Uncle Michal, go to the West.

17:15.583 --> 17:17.250
Can I speak to Dad?

17:17.333 --> 17:19.875
He's out at the moment.

17:19.958 --> 17:22.166
All will be good, Stasio.

17:22.250 --> 17:25.000
Why are little brothers always so worried?

17:25.083 --> 17:26.791
You're just one year older.

17:26.875 --> 17:28.708
Don't lecture me.

17:28.792 --> 17:30.833
I used to do that to you. Remember?

17:33.083 --> 17:34.917
Yes, I remember.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.917
Don't show all the time how smart you are.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.417
That always got you in trouble.

17:42.125 --> 17:44.208
I'm looking forward to seeing you again.

17:44.292 --> 17:45.708
Me too.

21:11.792 --> 21:13.542
-Good night.
-Good night.

24:09.125 --> 24:11.542
How long are you staying there?

24:11.625 --> 24:13.500
I really don't know.

24:14.917 --> 24:17.417
-A few weeks?
-Yes.

24:19.667 --> 24:21.167
Maybe longer.

24:33.125 --> 24:35.958
Uncle Zygmunt will take care of you.

24:36.042 --> 24:38.667
You'll see, you'll love New York.

56:47.083 --> 56:48.875
Look at you.

56:55.917 --> 56:58.667
Staszek, Stefania is dead.

1:28:14.125 --> 1:28:15.708
I like Molly.

1:28:21.000 --> 1:28:23.583
Do you have plans together?

1:28:25.708 --> 1:28:27.208
Plans?

1:28:31.792 --> 1:28:33.583
Actually, I do.

1:28:36.875 --> 1:28:39.708
I want to cut all ties with
my Jewish identity.

1:28:44.167 --> 1:28:45.458
Yes.

1:28:53.125 --> 1:28:55.458
I'm sorry I left you.

1:28:57.667 --> 1:28:59.917
I was wrong. I know that now.

1:29:02.792 --> 1:29:05.250
That's good to hear.

1:29:07.292 --> 1:29:09.958
-Thank you.
-I realized it a long time ago,

1:29:10.042 --> 1:29:12.667
but I didn't know how to tell you.

1:29:15.917 --> 1:29:17.875
Who do you think you are, Staszek?

1:29:20.208 --> 1:29:22.167
Who do you think you are?

1:29:27.125 --> 1:29:29.875
Now you feel the need to talk to me?

1:29:32.417 --> 1:29:34.417
So you wanted to talk all this time,

1:29:34.500 --> 1:29:36.625
but until now you couldn't?

1:29:37.917 --> 1:29:39.958
-It wasn't so easy.
-Mm-hm.

1:29:40.042 --> 1:29:41.792
Right.

1:29:43.667 --> 1:29:47.083
A few cards and a letter,
that's all you could manage.

1:29:47.167 --> 1:29:48.958
I called you.

1:29:51.917 --> 1:29:53.958
Yes.

1:29:54.042 --> 1:29:55.792
Every six months.

1:29:59.125 --> 1:30:05.000
So tell me, what's going on
in your fabulous life?

1:30:08.208 --> 1:30:09.875
Any new bombs?

1:30:13.125 --> 1:30:15.500
You must be so proud of yourself.

1:30:15.583 --> 1:30:18.583
-I shouldn't have left you.
-I don't care!

1:30:19.917 --> 1:30:22.500
You made a choice, now live with it.

1:30:24.333 --> 1:30:25.708
You'll scare her.

1:30:27.500 --> 1:30:30.500
You'll scare her. She's a good girl.

1:30:30.583 --> 1:30:33.042
I don't want you to lose her.

1:30:33.125 --> 1:30:35.417
-I know what happened.
-What happened?

1:30:35.500 --> 1:30:38.292
-She told me she found you...
-Yes, I fainted.

1:30:38.375 --> 1:30:39.958
I fainted, I lost consciousness.

1:30:40.042 --> 1:30:42.250
It can happen to anyone.
It's none of your business.

1:30:42.333 --> 1:30:44.833
-Listen--
-No, you listen to me, Stan.

1:30:46.958 --> 1:30:50.083
I was alone in a small room
in Cambridge...

1:30:51.583 --> 1:30:54.042
when I heard about Stefania's death.

1:30:54.125 --> 1:30:56.875
I just needed you to be there with me.

1:30:59.500 --> 1:31:02.083
But your bomb was more important.

1:31:04.792 --> 1:31:06.333
You're right.

1:31:09.250 --> 1:31:10.917
So what?

1:31:14.875 --> 1:31:17.042
What should I do with this now?

1:31:20.292 --> 1:31:22.167
Do you have a solution?

1:31:27.875 --> 1:31:29.583
Just leave.

1:31:41.708 --> 1:31:45.417
I didn't help create the bomb
to kill people.

1:31:47.375 --> 1:31:49.667
I wanted to save our family.

1:31:54.958 --> 1:31:56.958
I left you.

1:31:57.042 --> 1:31:58.583
Yes.

1:32:00.375 --> 1:32:02.750
But I went there hoping that...

1:32:09.083 --> 1:32:11.458
all I created in my life...

1:32:12.708 --> 1:32:14.583
is burnt sand.

1:32:15.833 --> 1:32:18.375
Around me, only ash and death.

1:32:24.667 --> 1:32:26.500
I don't want this anymore.
