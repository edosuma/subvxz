00:01.643 --> 00:03.602
<i>Previously...</i>

00:03.637 --> 00:04.936
I didn't get to properly
introduce myself before.

00:04.971 --> 00:08.915
I'm KC Cooper,
and I'm your cousin.

00:08.950 --> 00:12.310
I'm actually looking at
my mother's face.

00:12.346 --> 00:14.237
- Abby, she's alive.
- What?

00:14.272 --> 00:16.498
She's alive, and I know
where she is.

00:16.533 --> 00:18.058
We did good, Mom.

00:18.094 --> 00:21.003
You did good.

00:21.038 --> 00:22.938
So what are you really
doing here?

00:22.973 --> 00:25.274
- Carrying out my mission.
- Which is?

00:25.309 --> 00:27.159
To win KC's trust
so she'd convince Kira

00:27.194 --> 00:29.227
to bring me to you.

00:36.245 --> 00:39.421
Abby and Erica just have us
backed into a corner,

00:39.456 --> 00:42.224
and we're just supposed to carry out
whatever mission they ask of us.

00:42.259 --> 00:45.736
This is awful, and part of me
feels like it's all my fault.

00:45.771 --> 00:47.296
Why would you feel
that way, honey?

00:47.331 --> 00:49.398
Just because you insisted on
being friends with Abby

00:49.433 --> 00:52.159
even after I said let it go,
and because you insisted on

00:52.194 --> 00:53.977
making her a part of the family,

00:54.013 --> 00:56.597
even though I said
she was bad news,

00:56.599 --> 00:58.373
and because you were the one
that talked me into

00:58.408 --> 00:59.950
reuniting Abby with her mother,

00:59.985 --> 01:02.068
dragging my evil freak
of a sister

01:02.104 --> 01:05.188
out from under a rock
and back into our lives?

01:05.223 --> 01:09.009
No, honey, it ain't
your fault at all.

01:09.044 --> 01:11.019
You're not perfect
either, you know.

01:15.868 --> 01:17.692
Thanks for showing up, ladies.

01:17.728 --> 01:20.245
Not that you had a choice.

01:20.280 --> 01:22.347
Oh, Erica, nice shoes.

01:22.382 --> 01:24.115
I'd love to take
a better look at them

01:24.150 --> 01:25.830
right after a twister
drops a house on you.

01:27.512 --> 01:29.178
Interesting location
for a meeting.

01:29.214 --> 01:30.897
It's a convenient location,

01:30.932 --> 01:32.957
since your mission
will be carried out

01:32.993 --> 01:34.418
at the Georgetown Potomac Hotel.

01:34.453 --> 01:37.529
That's where the election night
results party's being held.

01:37.565 --> 01:40.106
I'm impressed, KC.

01:40.142 --> 01:42.417
Now I feel bad for
calling you a gullible idiot.

01:42.452 --> 01:44.235
Oh, do you want a beat down,

01:44.271 --> 01:46.229
'cause I'm having
a two-for-one special,

01:46.264 --> 01:47.847
and I do not charge delivery.
Let's go!

01:47.883 --> 01:50.117
All right, all right.

01:50.152 --> 01:52.034
Okay, Erica, come on, let's get
this over with. What do you want?

01:52.070 --> 01:54.120
KC will sneak us and a weapon

01:54.156 --> 01:55.530
past hotel security
tomorrow night.

01:55.566 --> 01:59.259
What? Absolutely not. I'm not
gonna let my baby do that.

01:59.294 --> 02:01.227
( Baby voice )
Oh, poor little KC.

02:01.263 --> 02:03.223
Do you also need
a nap during your mission?

02:04.499 --> 02:06.841
Oh, poor wittle Abby.

02:06.877 --> 02:08.393
Do you have a bwuised spween?

02:08.429 --> 02:09.845
That's enough, KC.

02:09.880 --> 02:10.920
But good shot, baby.

02:13.284 --> 02:15.433
If you don't do
what you're told,

02:15.468 --> 02:18.169
I'll be more than happy to
take an ax to the family tree.

02:18.205 --> 02:19.754
Starting with your branch.

02:21.491 --> 02:24.959
I'll be escorting you to the
hotel personally tomorrow night.

02:24.995 --> 02:26.378
But it's impossible to
bring a weapon into

02:26.413 --> 02:28.830
that highly secured area.

02:28.865 --> 02:30.523
Unless your father's
the future vice-president's

02:30.558 --> 02:31.558
head of security detail.

02:33.746 --> 02:36.271
Wow, two for two.

02:36.306 --> 02:38.081
Even a stopped clock
is right once a day.

02:38.117 --> 02:40.075
( Derisive chuckle )
It's twice a day.

02:40.110 --> 02:42.093
If you're gonna make
some sarcastic barbs,

02:42.128 --> 02:43.608
at least try to
make them right, okay?

02:50.938 --> 02:53.213
This is Agent Johnson. Code red.

02:53.248 --> 02:56.274
The future president
could be at risk.

02:56.309 --> 02:58.277
( Drunkenly )
Have a blessed day.

02:58.312 --> 03:01.755
( Normal voice ) Darn it. That
was a six-dollar espresso.

03:03.942 --> 03:07.243
¶ Oh, when danger
comes for you ¶

03:07.278 --> 03:10.480
¶ You know
I'll stand beside you ¶

03:10.482 --> 03:13.442
¶ 'Cause ain't nobody
keep things hustle cool ¶

03:13.477 --> 03:18.496
¶ I'll always find a way,
a way out of the fire ¶

03:18.532 --> 03:22.200
¶ Don't tell nobody,
tell nobody ¶

03:22.235 --> 03:24.293
¶ I'm not perfect ¶

03:24.329 --> 03:28.364
¶ So many things
I wanna tell you ¶

03:28.399 --> 03:32.260
¶ But I, I, I,
I keep it undercover ¶

03:32.296 --> 03:34.329
¶ Livin' my life,
no way to learn ¶

03:34.364 --> 03:36.606
¶ Doin' my thing,
gonna make it work ¶

03:36.641 --> 03:39.042
¶ Know I'm the realest,
baby, I'm fearless ¶

03:39.078 --> 03:41.152
¶ But I always got your back ¶

03:41.187 --> 03:42.996
¶ Nobody can do it like I can ¶

03:43.031 --> 03:45.240
¶ I gotta find out who I am ¶

03:45.275 --> 03:47.918
¶ Ain't got to worry about me ¶

03:47.953 --> 03:48.977
¶ It's all part of the plan ¶

03:49.012 --> 03:51.421
I keep it undercover.

03:51.456 --> 03:53.056
I keep it undercover.

03:58.280 --> 04:00.555
You know, I'd say
I'll miss you, Ernie,

04:00.590 --> 04:02.282
but my parents
taught me not to lie.

04:02.317 --> 04:05.193
Well, don't let the door hit ya

04:05.229 --> 04:09.238
where the good Lord split ya.

04:09.274 --> 04:12.225
That kid has no respect for me.

04:12.260 --> 04:14.861
If I never see him again,
it'll be too soon.

04:14.896 --> 04:16.646
You're heading up
his security team

04:16.681 --> 04:18.831
for the election results
party tomorrow night.

04:18.867 --> 04:19.958
So I guess it's too soon.

04:21.953 --> 04:25.046
What? I'm on the verge
of killing that obnoxious kid.

04:25.081 --> 04:28.575
Good. Then you can start
by protecting him from yourself.

04:28.610 --> 04:31.377
Fine. It's my own fault.

04:31.413 --> 04:33.533
I guess I'm just
too darn good at what I do.

04:36.643 --> 04:38.483
Yeah, let's just call it that.

04:42.783 --> 04:44.032
You need to get that
weapon through security,

04:44.067 --> 04:46.309
then await further instruction.

04:46.344 --> 04:48.128
You don't have
to do this, you know.

04:48.163 --> 04:49.345
( Derisive chuckle )

04:49.381 --> 04:51.156
You don't get it.

04:51.191 --> 04:53.758
I'm not the sweet little
orphan girl I pretended to be.

04:53.794 --> 04:56.569
I'm not being forced.
I want to do it.

04:56.605 --> 04:58.405
I was talking about
taking Connecticut Avenue.

05:00.075 --> 05:03.292
I mean, with this traffic,
we're not gonna move anywhere.

05:03.328 --> 05:05.420
So how about
you just turn around,

05:05.456 --> 05:08.365
and we'll do this next election.

05:08.400 --> 05:10.520
Enough, KC. You're not
gonna change my mind.

05:13.230 --> 05:14.663
Look, Abby,
I think you're confused.

05:14.698 --> 05:17.432
You just got your mom back,
and you wanna make her happy,

05:17.467 --> 05:19.976
- and that's normal.
- ( evil laughter )

05:20.012 --> 05:23.013
That evil laugh,
that's not normal.

05:23.048 --> 05:25.440
This is not about my mom.

05:25.475 --> 05:27.859
This is about
a lifetime of preparation.

05:27.894 --> 05:30.145
I was trained to be
the best of the worst.

05:30.180 --> 05:33.006
Please. I have seen
better worse.

05:33.042 --> 05:34.607
I mean, you're not
the worst best of the worst,

05:34.643 --> 05:37.644
but you are definitely not
the best best of the worst.

05:37.679 --> 05:40.630
For your information,
I'm special.

05:40.665 --> 05:42.556
- How?
- I just am.

05:42.592 --> 05:44.526
- Yeah, whatever.
- I am.

05:44.561 --> 05:46.269
No, you're just like
everybody else.

05:46.304 --> 05:48.888
Oh, really? Was everybody else raised
by the head of the Other Side?

05:48.924 --> 05:51.616
Yeah, right. No one even knows who
the head of the Other Side is.

05:51.651 --> 05:53.919
I do. I call him Daddy.

05:53.954 --> 05:55.887
That seems inappropriate.

05:59.384 --> 06:01.727
Unless he's your actual daddy.

06:01.762 --> 06:03.528
What can I say?

06:03.563 --> 06:05.296
I was born to be bad.

06:05.331 --> 06:07.590
Yeah, well, you weren't
born to drive,

06:07.625 --> 06:09.108
because we've been sitting
at this green light

06:09.144 --> 06:10.968
for the past two minutes.

06:11.004 --> 06:12.004
( Horns honking )

06:22.099 --> 06:23.548
COLIN: Who is it?

06:23.584 --> 06:25.224
It's Ernie.

06:25.260 --> 06:27.652
- Ernie who?
- Ernie Cooper.

06:27.687 --> 06:30.329
I don't think I know
an Ernie Cooper.

06:30.365 --> 06:32.682
You knew me when
you left my house yesterday.

06:32.717 --> 06:36.552
Oh! That Ernie Cooper.

06:36.587 --> 06:38.922
Sorry. I'm not supposed
to open the door.

06:38.957 --> 06:40.298
You can for me.

06:40.333 --> 06:42.225
I'm your head of security.

06:42.261 --> 06:43.844
If you're my head of security,

06:43.879 --> 06:45.520
then why can't you
open the door?

06:45.555 --> 06:48.398
Just open it!

06:51.035 --> 06:53.469
Thank you.

06:53.504 --> 06:55.571
Look, I know
you think I'm a loser,

06:55.606 --> 06:58.083
but I'm very qualified
to keep you safe,

06:58.085 --> 07:00.743
and I'll be keeping
my eyes on you at all times.

07:00.778 --> 07:02.970
So in other words,
you're my babysitter?

07:03.006 --> 07:05.932
Well, if I am,
that makes you a baby.

07:05.968 --> 07:08.618
Well, if I'm a baby,
go ahead and change my diaper!

07:08.653 --> 07:12.380
If the job requires it, I will.

07:14.901 --> 07:16.821
- This just got weird.
- Big time.

07:19.114 --> 07:20.362
( Machine beeps )

07:20.398 --> 07:22.023
- Next.
- ( machine beeps )

07:22.059 --> 07:23.683
Keep moving.

07:23.718 --> 07:26.428
Move it along.

07:26.463 --> 07:27.912
Okay, I'm in. What do I do now?

07:27.947 --> 07:31.090
ABBY: <i>Get through security
using the cloaking gadget</i>

07:31.125 --> 07:32.617
<i>I gave you, like we planned.</i>

07:32.652 --> 07:34.892
<i>Stop talking to me.
You look like a lunatic.</i>

07:37.065 --> 07:38.665
Says the girl who has
an elaborate plan

07:38.700 --> 07:39.991
to take over the world.

07:41.954 --> 07:43.194
Keep moving.

07:44.289 --> 07:45.529
Keep moving.

07:47.233 --> 07:48.500
Next.

07:50.903 --> 07:53.012
Next.

07:53.048 --> 07:54.622
Keep moving.

07:54.657 --> 07:57.342
Next.

07:59.004 --> 08:00.244
Move it along.

08:01.898 --> 08:02.898
Keep moving.

08:16.646 --> 08:18.271
( Alarm beeps )

08:18.306 --> 08:19.426
We need to do that again.

08:24.612 --> 08:26.079
Next.

08:27.949 --> 08:30.458
Excuse me. You've been
selected for random pat-down.

08:39.695 --> 08:40.760
Weapon! Get down!

08:44.441 --> 08:47.600
KC? What are you doing here?

08:47.635 --> 08:50.487
Uh, is it Bring
Your Daughter To Work Day?

08:50.522 --> 08:53.323
I'm sorry, Craig.
I forgot to tell you.

08:53.358 --> 08:55.666
I asked KC to be extra back-up.

08:55.702 --> 08:57.519
It's all right. She's with us.
It's all right.

08:57.554 --> 08:58.836
KC, you need to be more careful.

08:58.872 --> 09:00.104
These agents don't know you.

09:00.140 --> 09:02.340
They thought you were trying
to sneak a weapon in here.

09:02.375 --> 09:06.244
( Nervous laughter )

09:11.718 --> 09:13.134
Keeping this secret
from your father is killing me.

09:13.170 --> 09:16.538
Yeah, I have another secret
that you can't tell him about.

09:16.573 --> 09:19.032
I just found out that Abby's dad

09:19.067 --> 09:21.750
- is the head of the Other Side.
- Seriously?

09:21.786 --> 09:23.953
My sister married
the head of the Other Side?

09:23.988 --> 09:27.640
And my parents were disappointed
when I chose your father.

09:27.676 --> 09:29.267
Wait till they hear this.

09:32.105 --> 09:33.321
ABBY:<i> Keep moving.</i>

09:33.356 --> 09:36.283
<i>Telling Kira about my dad
won't do any good.</i>

09:36.285 --> 09:38.535
<i>Without a name or a face,
you have nothing.</i>

09:38.570 --> 09:40.570
Nothing but a deep hatred
for my cousin.

09:46.653 --> 09:48.533
<i>On your left room 1217.</i>

09:51.399 --> 09:54.767
It's locked. What now.

09:54.803 --> 09:56.536
<i>I guess we'll have to
call off the mission.</i>

09:56.571 --> 09:57.937
<i>You might as well go home.</i>

09:57.972 --> 10:00.098
- Really?
- <i>No!</i>

10:00.100 --> 10:01.949
<i>You're a spy.
Is this your first locked door?</i>

10:01.984 --> 10:03.904
No, it's not
my first locked door.

10:13.997 --> 10:16.272
<i>Place the dart gun
in the desk drawer.</i>

10:16.307 --> 10:19.075
Okay, I did it.

10:19.110 --> 10:21.719
<i>KC, there are cameras
everywhere.</i>

10:21.754 --> 10:24.430
<i>I can see you.
If you don't believe me,</i>

10:24.465 --> 10:26.899
<i>that pant suit
is no friend of yours.</i>

10:26.935 --> 10:29.055
<i>Now put the dart gun
in the drawer.</i>

10:37.704 --> 10:40.355
KC?

10:40.390 --> 10:42.499
Oh, Senator Cleveland.

10:42.534 --> 10:45.627
I was just, um...
checking the room.

10:45.662 --> 10:46.994
Making sure everything's secure.

10:47.030 --> 10:49.497
You know, like me,

10:49.532 --> 10:52.608
because I am rocking
this pant suit.

10:52.643 --> 10:54.602
In fact, I am rocking it

10:54.637 --> 10:56.879
harder than it's ever been
rocked before.

10:56.914 --> 10:59.240
- Right, Senator?
- Oh, yes, yes.

10:59.275 --> 11:01.526
You look very nice, KC.

11:01.561 --> 11:05.121
Uh... thank you?

11:05.157 --> 11:06.781
No problem.

11:11.654 --> 11:13.287
Mom, come in.

11:20.371 --> 11:21.713
Room service.

11:23.866 --> 11:26.868
Compliments of the hotel.

11:26.903 --> 11:28.644
In honor of you
winning the election.

11:28.679 --> 11:30.730
Oh, well, we haven't won yet.

11:30.765 --> 11:33.366
Oh, Senator, if I didn't
think you were going to win,

11:33.401 --> 11:34.434
I wouldn't be here.

11:37.964 --> 11:41.366
Now...

11:41.401 --> 11:44.369
Listen to the sound of my voice.

11:44.371 --> 11:47.246
You do remember the sound
of my voice, don't you?

11:47.282 --> 11:50.157
I remember.

11:50.193 --> 11:51.217
And I await your instructions.

11:51.252 --> 11:53.311
It worked.

11:53.346 --> 11:55.897
He's completely
under my control now.

11:55.932 --> 11:57.548
After I nail Ellis
with this dart,

11:57.583 --> 11:59.725
he'll go into a coma,

11:59.761 --> 12:01.803
and our vice-presidential puppet

12:01.805 --> 12:06.048
will be the acting
president of the United States.

12:06.083 --> 12:09.276
You need that sugar like
you need a hole in your head.

12:09.312 --> 12:10.537
How would you like
a hole in your head?

12:10.572 --> 12:13.631
- Try it. I dare you. I dare you!
- You make me sick.

12:13.666 --> 12:15.425
I can't stand the sight of you.

12:15.460 --> 12:17.652
Gotta admit, I missed you, babe.

12:17.687 --> 12:20.429
Same here, sweetheart.

12:20.464 --> 12:22.023
( Knock on door )

12:24.902 --> 12:27.512
Colin, where are you?

12:27.547 --> 12:29.680
Dude, it's not cool
to ditch your security.

12:29.716 --> 12:32.192
Just kidding, sir.

12:32.227 --> 12:34.543
I know exactly where
your son is.

12:34.578 --> 12:37.396
Sir? Are you all right?

12:37.432 --> 12:41.642
Hello! Are you okay?

12:41.678 --> 12:44.703
Oh, he's fine.
Just a little brainwashed.

12:44.739 --> 12:47.665
Aunt Erica. I didn't know
you were in DC.

12:47.701 --> 12:49.842
Hey, when did you get
a job in the hotel?

12:53.815 --> 12:57.583
Ernie, you are now
under my control.

12:57.619 --> 12:58.676
Do you understand?

12:58.711 --> 13:00.978
Yes, Aunt Erica.

13:01.014 --> 13:02.471
You will forget you ever saw me.

13:02.507 --> 13:05.742
And just to be sure you don't
get in the way tonight,

13:05.777 --> 13:08.644
whenever you hear
the word "election,"

13:08.680 --> 13:11.847
you will have
the overwhelming urge to pee.

13:11.883 --> 13:14.225
Do you understand?

13:14.261 --> 13:16.477
Yes, I understand.

13:16.512 --> 13:19.914
Let's be sure. Election.

13:19.950 --> 13:22.283
Election.
- ( Zipper unzips )

13:22.318 --> 13:23.501
Stop!

13:25.213 --> 13:27.639
To be clear,

13:27.641 --> 13:30.341
you will take care of
your urge in the bathroom.

13:36.733 --> 13:39.116
Excuse me. Sorry.

13:39.152 --> 13:41.569
Mom, I figured out
what their plan is.

13:41.604 --> 13:43.529
The second Ellis is
elected president,

13:43.564 --> 13:44.480
they're gonna shoot him
with a dart gun

13:44.515 --> 13:46.607
so we need to find out
who's going to use that weapon.

13:46.643 --> 13:48.317
Or you can keep your mouth shut

13:48.353 --> 13:50.269
and maybe your family will live.

13:50.304 --> 13:52.789
Bacon-wrapped fig?

13:52.824 --> 13:55.007
Look, what you guys
are doing is wrong,

13:55.043 --> 13:57.076
and you're not gonna
get away with it.

13:57.111 --> 13:58.277
This is all gonna be
tracked back to you.

13:58.312 --> 13:59.979
Will it?

14:00.014 --> 14:01.563
Or will it get tracked back
to the person whose fingerprints

14:01.599 --> 14:03.190
are on the dart gun?

14:03.226 --> 14:06.168
Which would be me.

14:06.203 --> 14:07.996
You're gonna pin this
on your own niece?

14:08.031 --> 14:09.871
We were never really that close.

14:12.752 --> 14:14.485
Oh, yeah? Well, you are awful.

14:14.520 --> 14:15.970
You just disgust me.

14:19.158 --> 14:23.820
There were no vegetarian
options on that tray.

14:23.855 --> 14:25.821
What am I supposed
to eat, the napkin?

14:25.857 --> 14:28.224
Vege-phobes.

14:28.259 --> 14:29.692
Mom, I'm serious.

14:29.727 --> 14:32.645
What they're doing can
take down the entire country.

14:32.680 --> 14:34.338
KC, you know what?
I think it's time

14:34.373 --> 14:39.110
we let your father and the
Organization know what's going on.

14:39.145 --> 14:42.246
Dad, Erica and Abby are here.

14:42.282 --> 14:43.965
What? How is that even possible?

14:44.000 --> 14:45.399
No one has gotten
in or out of this party

14:45.434 --> 14:46.759
without me knowing about it.

14:46.794 --> 14:48.761
Yeah, well, I kinda
sorta snuck them in.

14:48.796 --> 14:51.314
- KC!
- Dad, before you yell at me,

14:51.349 --> 14:55.317
okay, it gets worse.

14:55.353 --> 14:57.703
They're here with
the head of the Other Side.

14:57.738 --> 14:58.921
They're planning on doing
something to Ellis

14:58.956 --> 14:59.505
the second he becomes president.

14:59.540 --> 15:01.557
That's impossible.

15:01.593 --> 15:03.234
I'm in charge of security.

15:03.269 --> 15:04.789
There's no way to get
a weapon in here.

15:04.821 --> 15:06.662
- Unless KC snuck one in.
- KC!

15:06.698 --> 15:09.089
Dad, before you yell at me,

15:09.125 --> 15:11.192
it gets even worse.

15:13.496 --> 15:15.396
Look, because we don't know

15:15.431 --> 15:17.290
who the head of
the Other Side is,

15:17.325 --> 15:18.524
or what he looks like,
we can't stop him.

15:18.559 --> 15:20.576
Now you can yell at me.

15:20.611 --> 15:22.545
KC, good work.

15:22.580 --> 15:24.689
Good work?
How is that good work?

15:24.724 --> 15:26.865
The guy isn't gonna be
president for two minutes,

15:26.901 --> 15:29.110
and thanks to her,
he could be on his way out.

15:29.145 --> 15:32.330
Always with the glass
half full, huh, Craig?

15:32.365 --> 15:34.148
We've been trying to figure out

15:34.184 --> 15:35.058
who the head of the Other
Side is for years.

15:35.093 --> 15:38.920
Thanks to KC, we at least
know he's in this room.

15:38.955 --> 15:40.496
It's the closest we've ever been

15:40.532 --> 15:42.056
to taking him down.

15:42.091 --> 15:44.267
You're welcome.

15:44.302 --> 15:47.361
And we can talk about my thank-you
convertible another time.

15:47.397 --> 15:48.863
Save it, KC.

15:48.898 --> 15:52.116
We've been monitoring you
for the last two weeks.

15:52.151 --> 15:54.142
The only thing you did right

15:54.178 --> 15:55.277
was to finally come
to us with the truth.

15:55.313 --> 15:56.454
Okay, can you keep that in mind

15:56.489 --> 15:59.248
when you find my fingerprints
all over the weapon

15:59.250 --> 16:01.600
- used to take down the president?
- That's it!

16:01.635 --> 16:03.544
If they're gonna frame you,

16:03.579 --> 16:05.195
then the head of the Other Side

16:05.231 --> 16:07.022
can't leave his fingerprints
on the dart gun,

16:07.057 --> 16:08.749
so all we have to do
is find the guy

16:08.785 --> 16:10.017
at this party wearing gloves.

16:10.052 --> 16:11.293
Of course.

16:11.328 --> 16:13.688
And how hard could it be
to find someone wearing gloves?

16:19.303 --> 16:24.557
Apparently a lot harder
than I thought it would be.

16:30.047 --> 16:31.939
All right,
we have plenty of time,

16:31.974 --> 16:33.466
because I'm assuming
they're not gonna do

16:33.501 --> 16:34.450
anything to Ellis unless
he's actually elected,

16:34.485 --> 16:36.802
We're not gonna know
those results for a few hours.

16:36.837 --> 16:39.546
REPORTER ON TV:
<i>It's a landslide!</i>

16:39.582 --> 16:41.707
<i>It's early, but we're
calling it right now.</i>

16:41.742 --> 16:43.782
<i>Charles Ellis
has won the election.</i>

16:46.330 --> 16:49.048
So much for having
a few hours to find him.

16:49.083 --> 16:50.975
<i>Charles Ellis
and Jackson Cleveland</i>

16:51.011 --> 16:52.401
<i>will be giving
their acceptance speeches</i>

16:52.436 --> 16:55.687
<i>live in a matter of moments
from their headquarters</i>

16:55.723 --> 16:56.664
<i>at the Georgetown Potomac Hotel.</i>

16:56.699 --> 16:58.366
Dad, we need to find him.

16:58.401 --> 17:00.075
Yes, and we need to find
the assailant right now.

17:00.111 --> 17:02.219
Everybody fan out.

17:10.955 --> 17:14.548
Okay, Jackson, smile.
Act natural.

17:14.583 --> 17:17.334
<i>Introduce the president.</i>

17:17.370 --> 17:19.979
First, I'd like to say
to Mr. English,

17:20.014 --> 17:22.397
my high school
guidance counselor

17:22.433 --> 17:24.975
who told me I'd never
amount to anything,

17:25.010 --> 17:27.419
ding dong, you're wrong.

17:27.454 --> 17:29.330
I'm the vice-president!

17:33.411 --> 17:35.845
But anyway...

17:35.880 --> 17:40.007
It's been a long
election season,

17:40.042 --> 17:42.660
and we fought hard
to win this election.

17:42.695 --> 17:46.263
But let's not forget the real
winners of this election.

17:49.527 --> 17:53.220
Thank you for making
this country a wonderful...

17:53.256 --> 17:55.296
I've got eyes on Erica.
I'm taking her out.

17:58.553 --> 18:00.536
Don't move, Erica. I've got you.

18:00.572 --> 18:05.491
( Southern accent ) Erica? I don't
know to whom you are referring.

18:05.527 --> 18:08.051
Drop the phony Southern accent.

18:08.087 --> 18:09.979
You're not fooling anybody.

18:10.014 --> 18:11.694
You're not the belle
of this ball.

18:21.100 --> 18:22.992
The real winners
are the American people.

18:23.027 --> 18:25.219
( Cleveland continues
indistinctly )

18:51.965 --> 18:54.281
I made plenty of speeches
during this election.

18:54.317 --> 18:57.802
- Election.
- Election, election, election, election.

18:57.804 --> 18:59.478
Election, election,
election, election, election,

18:59.513 --> 19:04.466
Election, election, election,
election, election, election

19:09.324 --> 19:12.240
( bones cracking )

19:12.276 --> 19:15.744
It's time to bring out
President Ellis,

19:15.780 --> 19:18.314
the winner of the election!

19:18.349 --> 19:19.364
ERNIE: Election.

19:19.400 --> 19:21.483
I gotta pee!

19:34.898 --> 19:35.915
Hey, Uncle Craig.

19:43.349 --> 19:45.048
Craig, are you okay?

19:45.084 --> 19:46.700
We gotta go get Abby and Erica.

19:46.735 --> 19:49.175
You go get the head
of the Other Side.

19:50.315 --> 19:51.897
The head of the Other Side
was just in this room.

19:51.932 --> 19:54.057
Come on, where is he?

19:54.093 --> 19:56.118
Somebody had to see something.

19:56.154 --> 19:58.687
The head of the Other Side
just knocked me out.

19:58.722 --> 20:00.689
- He went that way.
- Thanks. Let's go.

20:10.610 --> 20:12.051
Where are they?

20:12.086 --> 20:14.145
( Boat speeding off )

20:14.180 --> 20:16.197
They're getting away!
Now what are we gonna do?

20:16.232 --> 20:17.698
Ship-to-shore.
Wanna get in, Mom?

20:17.733 --> 20:19.083
Okay.

20:28.661 --> 20:32.070
This is Agent 8780223
of the Organization,

20:32.106 --> 20:34.172
requesting backup from
the Coast Guard.

20:34.208 --> 20:37.476
We're right behind you,
and we're catching up.

20:40.372 --> 20:43.390
I cannot understand this girl.

20:43.426 --> 20:45.801
In a car, she was driving
ten miles an hour,

20:45.836 --> 20:48.262
but in a boat, she's halfway
across the Potomac.

20:48.297 --> 20:51.282
I hope for your sake,
you're wearing life vests.

20:58.357 --> 21:00.181
Mom, what are we
supposed to do now?

21:00.217 --> 21:01.834
Let the Coast Guard get 'em.

21:01.869 --> 21:04.245
We don't have our weapons.
There's nothing we can do.

21:04.280 --> 21:06.080
We can't let 'em
get away that easy.

21:06.115 --> 21:07.395
Look, you grab hold of the helm.

21:07.424 --> 21:09.299
- I've got an idea.
- Okay.

21:09.335 --> 21:11.095
- You got it?
- Yeah. Got it.

21:14.398 --> 21:16.765
- Come on, KC.
- I got it.

21:20.696 --> 21:21.696
You missed!

21:24.375 --> 21:26.275
( Abby laughing )

21:37.313 --> 21:39.980
Well, looks like they
won't be joining us

21:40.015 --> 21:41.290
for Thanksgiving this year.

21:43.269 --> 21:46.628
Well, I guess now that I've
saved the president's life,

21:46.663 --> 21:49.130
you'd like to know that
you do respect me.

21:49.166 --> 21:51.466
No. If it wasn't for you,

21:51.502 --> 21:52.718
my dad would be president.

21:55.131 --> 21:57.264
Uh, Dad, am I still in charge

21:57.299 --> 21:58.699
- of keeping Colin safe?
- No, you're done.

21:58.734 --> 22:02.353
Good, 'cause I'm about to kick
your obnoxious little butt.

22:06.409 --> 22:09.093
Well, now that Ernie and I
have been de-programmed,

22:09.128 --> 22:11.403
for my first official act
as vice-president,

22:11.438 --> 22:13.906
I would like to declare this
Cooper Day.

22:13.941 --> 22:16.408
- Can you do that?
- No, but I'd like to.

22:19.589 --> 22:21.589
- Thanks for everything, Craig.
- No problem.

22:21.624 --> 22:26.043
And congratulations, Coopers,
for finally revealing

22:26.079 --> 22:28.186
the leader of the Other Side.

22:28.222 --> 22:31.606
Now all we have to do
is find him and capture him.

22:31.642 --> 22:33.241
Okay, that sounds like
a lot more work

22:33.276 --> 22:35.260
now that I said it out loud.

22:37.673 --> 22:39.715
You okay, KC?

22:39.750 --> 22:41.467
Yeah, it's just...

22:41.502 --> 22:43.059
I just wish that
I didn't have to...

22:43.095 --> 22:44.970
They're still our family.

22:45.005 --> 22:46.871
Honey, you didn't have a choice.

22:46.907 --> 22:49.166
You did what you had to do.

22:49.202 --> 22:51.282
Any one of us would
have done the same thing.

22:57.543 --> 22:59.243
I got you.

23:01.622 --> 23:03.072
Thanks, Daddy.

23:03.107 --> 23:04.715
Now to get those Coopers.

23:04.750 --> 23:06.742
All in due time, honey.

23:06.777 --> 23:08.911
We're playing the long game now.

23:08.946 --> 23:10.387
We got bigger fish to fry.

23:10.423 --> 23:14.216
I have a long list of people who
could still make our plan work.

23:14.252 --> 23:17.870
Believe me,
this is far from over.

23:17.905 --> 23:21.056
Baby, you are so good
at being bad.

23:21.091 --> 23:22.516
You know I am.

23:26.038 --> 23:27.646
Ew, gross!

23:30.518 --> 23:33.076
<i>Rob, your name's on TV.</i>
