BUT I CAN'T TAKE IT FOR FEAR HE'D
FIND THE PRICE I PAID FOR IT.

19:25.331 --> 19:27.993
I TRIED TO FIND PITY FOR HIM
AND FOR ME, BUT I CAN'T.

19:28.084 --> 19:31.497
IT'S LIKE MY HEART'S BEEN CUT OUT AND
STONE PUT VVHERE THE HEART VVAS.

19:31.545 --> 19:33.502
OH, THAT AIN'T

FERN UP ON THE MOUNTAIN.

28:31.585 --> 28:35.044
I NOTICE A LOT OF VIXENWORT
AROUND HERE MYSELF.

28:38.008 --> 28:40.295
I JUST CAME
FROM BILLY-BEN'S.

28:40.385 --> 28:42.877
FIXED HIS
BREAKFAST FOR HIM.

28:44.556 --> 28:47.924
WELL...l RECKON THAT'S
NO CONCERN OF MINE.

28:52.856 --> 28:56.724

29:01.657 --> 29:02.897
FOR HIS SAKE.

29:02.950 --> 29:05.738
YOU STILL

29:05.786 --> 29:11.122
THE LAST TIME I SAVV BILLY-BEN TURNER'S
FACE, HE VVAS UNDER A MAGIC SPELL.

29:11.208 --> 29:14.041
AND EVEN THE LOVE I HOLD
FOR HIM COULDN'T BREAK IT.

29:15.796 --> 29:19.130
THERE'S WAYS,
BUT SUCH WAYS END BAD.

29:19.216 --> 29:21.298
WHAT WAYS YOU

29:31.937 --> 29:33.427

29:34.982 --> 29:36.973
I'M HEARTSICK

29:37.067 --> 29:39.229
TO SEE WRONG DONE
TO A GOOD MAN.

29:41.363 --> 29:44.776
I GOT NEVVS. THERE'S A
VVILDCAT LOOSE IN THE COUNTY.

29:44.866 --> 29:47.028
AIN'T YOU SCARED
TO BE UP HERE ALONE?

29:47.119 --> 29:50.862
I'LL BE HOME BY DARK. THAT CAT
VVON'T VENTURE OUT UNTIL NIGHTFALL.

29:52.374 --> 29:54.365
CAN'T TELL WHAT
A WILDCAT WILL DO.

29:54.459 --> 29:58.123
WELL, I RECKON WE
DON'T HAVE MUCH TO FEAR.

29:58.213 --> 30:01.672
MY DADDY SAYS THAT KILLER CAT'S
GONNA BE DEAD BY MORNING.

30:01.758 --> 30:06.548
OH? SINCE VVHEN YOUR DADDY BEEN ABLE TO LOOK

30:06.638 --> 30:09.721
WHY, HE'S GOING HUNTING

30:09.808 --> 30:12.891
HIM, AND OBED MILLER, AND
BILLY-BEN, AND ALL THE MEN.

30:12.978 --> 30:16.221
BILLY-BEN NEVER SAID
NOTHING TO ME ABOUT GOING.

30:16.315 --> 30:18.397
<i>OBED MILLER JUST WENT
OVER AND ASKED HIM.</i>

30:18.483 --> 30:22.351
I RECKON THAT CAT BETTER STAY
HOME TONIGHT IF IT'S SMART.

30:24.323 --> 30:25.654
I RECKON.

30:34.833 --> 30:36.995
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU TONIGHT, JESS?

30:37.085 --> 30:40.248
YOU JUST AS NERVOUS
AS A FOX IN A FOREST FIRE.

30:40.339 --> 30:43.502
YOU GONNA TAKE ALL NIGHT
WITH THAT HEM, MAMA?

30:43.550 --> 30:45.882

30:45.969 --> 30:49.758
VVITHOUT BILLY-BEN HAVIN' GIVEN ME THE
MONEY. YOU KNOVV THAT, DON'T YOU?

30:49.848 --> 30:52.761
SAW OLD ELLY GLOVER TODAY.

30:52.851 --> 30:55.263
SHE WAS PICKING WILDFLOWERS
UP ON THE MOUNTAIN.

30:55.354 --> 30:56.890
HOW'D SHE LOOK?

30:56.980 --> 30:59.563
LOOKED SICKLY,
LIKE SHE MIGHT DIE SOON.

30:59.649 --> 31:02.266
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
THE POOR THING WAS AILING.

31:02.361 --> 31:04.193
LOOKED TERRIBLE.

31:04.279 --> 31:07.692
THERE, NOVV YOU CAN GET OUT
OF IT AND HAND IT TO ME.

31:07.741 --> 31:11.609
I OUGHT TO MAKE SOME OF THAT TONIC

31:20.420 --> 31:24.880
<i>WELL, EVERYONE KNOWS SHE SELLS

31:24.966 --> 31:28.129
SHE AIN'T SOLD NONE
TO YOU, HAS SHE?

31:29.429 --> 31:30.965
DON'T TALK CRAZY TALK.

31:32.641 --> 31:36.134
IS THAT WHAT MADE
BILLY-BEN TURNER BLIND

31:36.228 --> 31:40.062
TO EVERY OTHER WOMAN ON
EARTH SAVE JESS-BELLE?

31:40.107 --> 31:42.724
VVHERE VVOULD I GET THE MONEY
FOR POTIONS AND POVVDERS?

31:42.776 --> 31:45.814
THAT OLD WOMAN DON'T
ALWAYS ASK FOR MONEY.

31:45.904 --> 31:49.772
THAT'S WHAT MAKES MY
HEART TURN COLD AS ICE.

31:51.410 --> 31:53.401
JESS, HOW DID
YOU PAY HER?

32:00.919 --> 32:04.503
OH, GOD, JESS, HOW

GOD TO HELP YOU.

32:37.080 --> 32:40.072
MY PRAYERS AREN'T ANSVVERED

32:41.585 --> 32:44.043
I'LL THINK OF A

HOW DO YOU KNOW
SHE'S DEAD, BILLY-BEN?

37:48.183 --> 37:50.390
I SAW HER DIE.

37:56.399 --> 37:59.608
I BROUGHT YOU SOMETHING I THOUGHT
YOU OUGHT TO HA\/E, BILLY-BEN.

37:59.652 --> 38:01.780
IT USED TO BELONG

38:03.323 --> 38:05.280
POOR JESS.

38:05.366 --> 38:07.198
I APPRECIATE
IT, MISS OSSIE.

38:07.285 --> 38:09.947
I BROUGHT IT
FOR A SPECIAL REASON.

38:09.996 --> 38:14.365
IT'S MADE OF SILVER, AND SILVER IS ONE
THING THAT A VVITCH IS SCARED OF.

38:14.459 --> 38:16.621
WHAT WITCH WOULD
WANT TO HARM ELLY?

38:16.669 --> 38:20.287
I'VE GOT A TERRIBLE THING
TO TELL YOU, BILLY-BEN.

38:20.381 --> 38:22.793
A SECRET
ABOUT JESS-BELLE.

38:22.884 --> 38:25.967
I KNOW A SECRET
ABOUT JESS-BELLE MYSELF.

38:26.012 --> 38:29.721
THE SAME NIGHT THAT
SHE DISAPPEARED, WE TALKED,

38:29.808 --> 38:34.644
AND NOT MEANING TO, SHE--
SHE MENTIONED GRANNY HART.

38:34.729 --> 38:39.018
AND THEN I FOUND OUT SOMETHING
I'D SOONER BE DEAD THAN KNOVV.

38:41.152 --> 38:43.359
JESS-BELLE WAS WITCHED.

38:43.446 --> 38:47.690
I DIDN'T KNOW IT MYSELF
TILL THAT NIGHT SHE DIED.

38:47.784 --> 38:51.493
SHE AIN'T DEAD, BILLY-BEN.

38:52.872 --> 38:55.364
BUT I WAS THERE.

38:55.458 --> 38:58.826
I FIRED ONE
OF THE SHOTS MYSELF.

38:58.920 --> 39:02.538
L'\/E SPENT MANY A RESTLESS
NIGHT GRIEVING ABOUT THAT.

39:02.632 --> 39:04.748
BILLY-BEN,

39:04.843 --> 39:09.007
SOME MONTHS BACK, I WENT
INTO JESS-BELLE'S ROOM

39:10.557 --> 39:13.720
AND THERE ON-ON
JESS-BELLE'S PILLOW

39:13.810 --> 39:16.598
WAS A WART
TOAD SITTING.

39:16.688 --> 39:19.851
NOW, I-| GRABBED A BROOM

39:19.899 --> 39:22.231
AND I BROUGHT THAT DOWN

39:22.318 --> 39:26.903
WITH ALL MY MIGHT
ON THAT UGLY THING.

39:26.990 --> 39:30.733
AND IT JUST DISAPPEARED
IN-IN A CLOUD OF SMOKE

39:30.827 --> 39:34.741
AND WENT FLOATING OUT
THROUGH THE WINDOW.

39:34.831 --> 39:38.790
WELL, MAY-MAYBE IT WAS
JUST A CLOUD OF DUST,

39:38.877 --> 39:41.039
AND-AND THE TOAD, UH,
FALL ONTO THE FLOOR.

39:41.087 --> 39:42.919
NO, IT WAS THE SPIRIT
OF JESS-BELLE.

39:43.006 --> 39:45.714
MISS OSSIE, NOW,
I SAW HER DIE.

39:45.758 --> 39:50.548
BILLY-BEN, DON'T YOU KNOW
YOU CAN'T KILL A WITCH?

39:50.638 --> 39:53.881
THEY JUST CHANGE
TO SOMETHING ELSE!

39:53.933 --> 39:57.642
BUT IF A PERSON'S GOOD AND STRONG, A
VVITOH CAN'T HARM THEM, I'\/E HEARD.

39:58.855 --> 40:00.516
IT'S SAID.

40:08.740 --> 40:10.572
WELL, THEN,

40:10.658 --> 40:13.616
ELLY HAS NOTHING
TO FEAR FROM JESS-BELLE.

40:18.541 --> 40:21.329
L-I'M SORRY, MISS OSSIE,
BUT I GOT TO HURRY.

40:21.419 --> 40:24.252

44:28.082 --> 44:31.666
ELLY GLOVER

44:31.711 --> 44:33.668
SHE'S A BEAUTY, TOO.

44:33.754 --> 44:35.540
WELL, I'LL NOT HAVE
HER BEAUTY LONG

44:35.631 --> 44:38.089
UNLESS YOU HELP ME
RID MYSELF OF A WITCH.

44:38.176 --> 44:40.918
JESS-BELLE DON'T LIKE
YOU BEING MARRIED, DO SHE?

44:41.012 --> 44:42.923
IT WAS JESS-BELLE,
ALRIGHT.

44:43.014 --> 44:44.721
OH, I KNOW.

44:44.807 --> 44:48.892
I WITCHED THAT GAL
SO SHE COULD WIN YOUR LOVE.

44:48.978 --> 44:50.844
I NEVER WANTED
NO WITCH'S LOVE.

44:52.440 --> 44:55.774
HUMANS DON'T KNOW
NOTHING ABOUT LOVING.

44:55.860 --> 44:58.978
VVELL, I KNOVV ENOUGH IF
ANYTHING HAPPENS TO ELLY,

45:00.573 --> 45:02.439

45:02.533 --> 45:05.366
OH, JESS-BELLE AIN'T GOING
TO HURT YOUR LITTLE BRIDE.

45:05.453 --> 45:07.785
SHE'S JUST TEASING
AND HAVING A GOOD TIME.

45:07.872 --> 45:11.536
GRANNY, I-l LEFT MY VVIFE ALONE.
NOVV, I GOT TO GET BACK TO HER!

45:11.584 --> 45:13.791
NOTHING IS HOLDING

VVELL, I DON'T HARDLY KNOVV NO VVAY.
UNLESS'N YOU KILL HER.

45:21.886 --> 45:25.880
YOU CAN'T KILL HER. ALL SHE DOES
IS GO UP IN A PUFF OF SMOKE

45:25.973 --> 45:28.226
AND THEN SHE COMES
RIGHT BACK AGAIN!

45:28.267 --> 45:30.304
THERE'S WAYS.

45:30.394 --> 45:31.600
WELL, TELL ME.

45:31.687 --> 45:34.805

45:34.899 --> 45:37.766
WELL, WHAT DO YOU WANT?

45:37.860 --> 45:40.067
A LOCK OF YOUR HAIR.

45:40.154 --> 45:42.862

ME LIKE THAT!

45:47.119 --> 45:49.110
[scoffs]

45:49.205 --> 45:52.743
IT TAKES LOTS OF MONEY TO
LEARN HOVV TO KILL A VVITCH.

45:59.924 --> 46:01.961
YOU GO HOME.

46:02.051 --> 46:05.589
MAKE A FIGURE
OF JESS-BELLE.

46:05.638 --> 46:09.256
THEN PUT ON IT CLOTHES
THAT JESS-BELLE HAS WORN.

46:09.308 --> 46:12.972
THEN, IF YOU HAVE
THE COURAGE,

46:13.062 --> 46:16.271
STAB IT THROUGH
THE HEART WITH SILVER.

46:32.957 --> 46:34.914
[screams]

46:39.297 --> 46:41.208
IT'S GOT TO BE
A DRESS SHE WORE.

THAT THING YOU FELT IN OUR HOUSE
VVAS THE SPIRIT OF JESS-BELLE.

47:17.543 --> 47:19.250
SHE WAS A WITCH.

47:19.337 --> 47:21.544
BUT I KNOW HOW
TO GET RID OF WITCHES.

47:21.630 --> 47:25.339
