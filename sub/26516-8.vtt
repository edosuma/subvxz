00:19.103 --> 00:20.605
<i>Previously on </i> Bad Blood.

00:20.688 --> 00:24.317
All of you are now gonna buy
your drugs from me.

00:24.400 --> 00:26.336
<i>I've been running contraband
for over a decade.</i>

00:26.360 --> 00:29.613
I'm wondering if you're up for moving
something other than cigarettes?

00:29.697 --> 00:32.283
- Who's that?
- The 'Ndrangheta bosses.

00:32.366 --> 00:34.077
<i>I have a CI who told me
about the meeting.</i>

00:34.160 --> 00:37.497
- I want to know about the newcomers.
- They're cousins from Calabria.

00:37.580 --> 00:39.415
<i>Teresa and Christian Langana.</i>

00:39.498 --> 00:41.667
We want you to be
our partner in Montreal.

00:41.752 --> 00:43.377
I don't work for anyone. Ever.

00:45.672 --> 00:47.548
- Get down!
<i>- We need to find Declan.</i>

00:47.632 --> 00:49.550
<i>We need to end this.</i>

00:49.633 --> 00:53.262
<i>Those twins kidnapped my nephew.
I want Reggie back alive.</i>

00:53.345 --> 00:55.848
I have 30 seconds. You gotta help me.
My son's been kidnapped.

00:55.932 --> 00:57.683
- What?
- You think I'm gonna forget this?

00:57.767 --> 01:00.228
You should.
This was me and you fixing their mess.

01:02.355 --> 01:04.607
They're charging him
with second-degree murder.

01:04.690 --> 01:08.193
A ball of fentanyl this size
is worth 20 million.

01:08.277 --> 01:10.697
We wanna talk to you
about the fentanyl business.

01:10.780 --> 01:12.424
I want you to get distribution
up and running.

01:12.448 --> 01:13.658
Wes!

01:13.742 --> 01:16.870
I wanna destroy those bastards!
Every last one of them.

01:16.953 --> 01:20.290
This detective told me if
I didn't tell her stuff, she'd tell you.

01:20.373 --> 01:22.667
I know these people
and their love of family.

01:22.750 --> 01:26.128
<i>The only way we win is
to get them to rip themselves apart.</i>

01:26.212 --> 01:30.467
- Val! What did you do?
- I had no choice. It had to be done, Enzo.

01:32.010 --> 01:34.512
- How's the purity?
- 90%, as always.

01:36.263 --> 01:38.015
He cut it way too much.

01:38.098 --> 01:41.227
For both of our businesses,
we want you to take care of Declan.

01:41.310 --> 01:42.645
Deal.

01:42.728 --> 01:44.188
What's up, Bobby? Uh!

01:44.272 --> 01:47.483
I now own the protection contract on Nats.

01:47.567 --> 01:51.112
You're gonna walk right into the RCMP
and turn on Teresa and Christian.

01:51.195 --> 01:54.532
My brother's turning rat and there's
nothing I can do to stop him.

01:56.367 --> 01:58.035
Teresa Langana.

01:58.118 --> 02:00.247
With Enzo's testimony,
we have enough to bring her in.

02:00.330 --> 02:01.330
Police!

02:04.083 --> 02:05.083
Uhh!

02:06.585 --> 02:07.585
Uh!

02:10.673 --> 02:13.718
<i>I found Declan. And his girlfriend too.</i>

02:13.802 --> 02:16.637
- What do you want me to do?
- Wait for me.

03:37.052 --> 03:38.302
You two, there.

03:39.553 --> 03:41.222
You two, go there.

05:01.177 --> 05:02.970
Put the gun down!

05:07.850 --> 05:10.520
If you wanna see your friends,
you'll put it down.

05:54.605 --> 05:57.192
I've been wanting to bring you here
ever since you got out.

05:58.902 --> 06:00.778
Hey, little sis!

06:00.862 --> 06:03.280
I brought your boy.

06:04.490 --> 06:06.450
When your mama died,

06:06.533 --> 06:08.870
I didn't have two nickels
to rub together.

06:10.037 --> 06:12.707
Stole a car so I could pay
for the plot and the headstone.

06:14.167 --> 06:16.644
I knew the guy whose car it was,
so I eventually paid him back.

06:16.668 --> 06:19.130
I didn't want that
karma hanging over her.

06:22.592 --> 06:25.010
- Do you come here a lot?
- Ah...

06:25.093 --> 06:26.887
You know, when I can.

06:26.970 --> 06:28.848
Never as much as I'd like to.

06:34.145 --> 06:37.107
Reggie, I bought
the plot next to your mum.

06:37.190 --> 06:39.942
It's for me, when my time comes.

06:40.025 --> 06:41.902
It's all paid for.

06:41.985 --> 06:44.447
You just have to
make arrangements, OK?

06:44.530 --> 06:45.740
OK.

06:58.878 --> 07:01.797
- Do you mind if we stay here a while?
- No.

07:02.798 --> 07:04.467
As long as you want.

07:37.583 --> 07:40.252
I ate breakfast already, remember?

07:40.335 --> 07:42.172
We're not here to eat.

07:44.007 --> 07:45.382
I bought this place for you.

07:47.593 --> 07:49.012
This diner.

07:49.095 --> 07:50.680
It's yours now.

07:50.763 --> 07:53.682
It was run by an unsavoury
element before,

07:53.765 --> 07:55.433
but they'll be gone soon.

07:55.518 --> 07:57.770
You start from scratch,
hire whoever you want.

07:58.770 --> 08:00.732
- You bought me a restaurant?
- Yeah.

08:00.815 --> 08:03.567
You can make your breakfast
day and night, seven days a week.

08:08.697 --> 08:13.160
I... I don't know anything
about running a business!

08:13.243 --> 08:16.497
Like, you gotta pay taxes
and do the books and stuff.

08:16.580 --> 08:19.750
You'll learn. I got a guy who can help
you with that. I got guys for everybody.

08:21.127 --> 08:23.963
This is yours now, Reggie.

08:24.047 --> 08:25.882
OK! Uh...

08:25.965 --> 08:29.510
I got that 15 grand still,
that you gave to me.

08:29.593 --> 08:31.012
- All of it?
- Yeah, I got it.

08:31.095 --> 08:32.495
So I'm gonna give that back to you,

08:32.554 --> 08:35.892
and then whatever else
I will pay back, as I can, with interest!

08:35.975 --> 08:38.477
- Of course.
- I'm not gonna put a vig on my own nephew.

08:38.559 --> 08:40.400
- This is for you, Reggie!
- I want to, though.

08:40.477 --> 08:43.398
I wanna pay it,
so that it's really mine.

08:43.482 --> 08:46.027
I wanna sign papers, the whole thing,

08:46.110 --> 08:48.171
and I'm not gonna take it,
unless we're doing it right.

08:48.195 --> 08:51.032
I don't put my name on any
piece of paper. But I hear you.

08:51.115 --> 08:53.200
- Come on!
- Yeah.

08:53.283 --> 08:55.202
I can't believe this!

08:55.285 --> 08:57.372
Thank you!

08:57.455 --> 08:59.873
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

09:01.250 --> 09:03.168
- Do you wanna run it with me?
- I... No.

09:03.252 --> 09:05.295
- It's not my thing. But thank you!
- Come on, man!

09:05.378 --> 09:08.798
It's like a fresh start!
You and me. A new life, right?

09:08.882 --> 09:10.718
I want you to be around
for a long time.

09:10.802 --> 09:13.303
Aw, come on! Don't worry.
I'm not going anywhere.

09:15.180 --> 09:17.140
All right, I wanna
buy you breakfast then, OK?

09:17.223 --> 09:18.977
- Yeah.
- Really?

09:19.060 --> 09:21.228
- Buy you breakfast?
- Sure!

09:31.738 --> 09:35.952
The other thing... All I'm gonna do,
build-it-yourself omelettes.

09:36.035 --> 09:39.872
Choices paralyze people, Reggie, right?
You have a few specialized items.

09:39.955 --> 09:43.000
Small menu. Yeah,
I don't want to paralyze people.

09:43.083 --> 09:45.043
Hey.

09:45.127 --> 09:49.840
- Hey! Declan bought me a diner!
- I heard. Congratulations!

09:49.923 --> 09:51.925
I'm gonna name
an omelette after you.

09:52.008 --> 09:53.385
- Nice!
- The Rose.

09:53.468 --> 09:55.805
- I'm honoured.
- That's good, right?

09:55.888 --> 09:58.265
It's very good! Get outta here!

10:01.060 --> 10:02.143
Morning!

10:03.187 --> 10:05.272
- Morning!
- How you feeling?

10:06.273 --> 10:07.942
Better than I should.

10:08.985 --> 10:10.610
Got that shipment today.

10:10.695 --> 10:12.195
Yeah. Twix and the boys are on it.

10:12.278 --> 10:14.907
You sure about doing this
in broad daylight?

10:14.990 --> 10:18.243
No, I just thought I'd flip a coin
and move in 20 keys of cocaine.

10:18.327 --> 10:20.207
No, the water cops,
they gave me their schedule,

10:20.287 --> 10:23.290
and they're only doing
night sweeps this week, so...

10:23.373 --> 10:25.625
- I know what I'm doing.
- I know you do.

10:27.293 --> 10:29.130
And this is my last run.

10:32.800 --> 10:36.345
I know the war's over, but
someone else is just gonna come along,

10:36.428 --> 10:38.972
and it's just gonna start all over again.

10:39.057 --> 10:41.350
And I got into this
to take care of my family,

10:41.433 --> 10:43.935
and I can't do that
if I'm dead or in jail.

10:46.480 --> 10:48.357
I've already lost someone.

10:50.943 --> 10:53.320
And I thought I could do this,
but I can't.

10:56.240 --> 10:57.783
Is that gonna be a problem?

10:59.160 --> 11:01.412
Well, you...
You know who you are.

11:02.622 --> 11:04.790
I respect that more than anything.

11:05.792 --> 11:06.792
Anything.

11:21.140 --> 11:25.060
This is Teresa Langana.
She's the queen.

11:25.143 --> 11:27.187
Her brother Christian's already dead.

11:27.270 --> 11:31.025
Her photo's been sent to all airports
and border crossings across the country.

11:31.108 --> 11:33.693
This is who we want.

11:33.777 --> 11:36.613
Reach out to all your CIs,
your contacts,

11:36.697 --> 11:38.823
your mother, if she can help.

11:38.907 --> 11:40.450
Thank you!

11:41.743 --> 11:43.745
Where are we with Nats's transfer?

11:43.828 --> 11:46.548
Just waiting on the paperwork,
but he should get in a van any minute.

11:46.623 --> 11:48.643
And the deal with Enzo's lawyer,
is that all drawn up?

11:48.667 --> 11:51.337
Yeah. Everything's ready.
Why are you so edgy? We got them.

11:51.420 --> 11:53.380
Declan handed us what we do have.

11:55.090 --> 11:57.635
A win's a win, right?

11:57.718 --> 11:59.928
You're the one that told me that.

12:00.012 --> 12:02.055
All anyone cares about's the net result.

12:02.932 --> 12:04.350
Yeah, well...

12:06.685 --> 12:08.520
maybe I was wrong.

12:23.452 --> 12:24.745
Everything good?

12:24.828 --> 12:26.830
We're ready to go.
Be back in a few hours.

12:26.913 --> 12:29.542
My driver's right on schedule.
Keep your eyes open.

12:29.625 --> 12:31.085
Got it, bro! I'm your guy!

12:33.587 --> 12:36.007
All right. See you back here.

12:37.423 --> 12:38.550
"Bro"?

12:38.633 --> 12:41.595
My brother has a bit of a hero-worship
thing going with you.

12:41.678 --> 12:44.140
All right. Hang on.

12:45.640 --> 12:46.683
Yeah?

12:46.767 --> 12:48.602
- You got the shipment?
<i>- I said I would.</i>

12:48.685 --> 12:50.437
- It's coming.
<i>- Good.</i>

12:50.520 --> 12:54.400
We have to meet somewhere else.
The cops have been around our spots.

12:54.483 --> 12:57.068
- I'll send you the coordinates.
- All good.

13:01.865 --> 13:04.868
Declan's delivering a new
shipment to us this afternoon.

13:07.328 --> 13:10.332
My guys will be waiting
to take him out.

13:12.333 --> 13:15.045
When Declan arrives, do not hesitate.

13:15.128 --> 13:18.590
- I want him dead.
- I know how it's done.

13:18.673 --> 13:22.260
And what about Nats and Enzo? Hmm?
You said you would take care of that.

13:22.343 --> 13:24.347
It's all arranged.

13:24.430 --> 13:26.723
By the end of the day,
they'll both be gone.

13:29.852 --> 13:30.937
Good.

14:14.062 --> 14:16.107
<i>How did this happen?</i>

14:16.190 --> 14:18.858
I don't believe this!

14:20.152 --> 14:21.695
What's wrong?

14:21.778 --> 14:23.572
Nats is dead.

14:24.740 --> 14:27.702
He was stabbed, just as they
were about to transfer him.

14:28.785 --> 14:30.997
- Who did it?
- They don't know.

14:36.752 --> 14:39.255
If we tell Enzo, he's gonna walk.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.548
I know!

14:42.633 --> 14:47.095
It's five more minutes and they
would've called saying he's on the road.

14:47.178 --> 14:49.449
That would've been good enough
to get Enzo to sign the papers.

14:49.473 --> 14:51.558
Yeah, but he's not. He's dead.

14:51.642 --> 14:53.619
It's matter of minutes.
You gonna let him walk for that?

14:53.643 --> 14:55.812
You gonna blow this case
on a matter of five minutes?

15:15.332 --> 15:17.375
Well, is my son safe?

15:17.458 --> 15:18.918
Is my son safe?

15:28.928 --> 15:32.348
Your son is currently on his way
to the country club as we speak.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.935
- So, he's safe.
- Yes.

15:41.400 --> 15:43.443
OK. OK, good.

15:45.528 --> 15:46.947
First things first.

15:48.073 --> 15:50.783
On the record, hand to God,

15:50.867 --> 15:54.120
my nephew Luca has had
no dealings in our business whatsoever.

15:54.203 --> 15:57.875
You're not to touch him. Total immunity.
Don't even send him a text.

15:57.958 --> 16:00.002
We already agreed to that.

16:00.085 --> 16:02.128
It's in the deal.

16:02.212 --> 16:03.922
Once you sign,

16:04.005 --> 16:07.050
Luca is no longer a person
of interest in any of your affairs.

16:08.052 --> 16:10.178
Also, your son cannot
be charged with anything

16:10.262 --> 16:13.515
other than the murder charge
he's currently waiting on trial for.

16:14.683 --> 16:16.310
Thank you.

16:18.437 --> 16:19.688
Pen.

16:19.772 --> 16:21.648
- Sign here.
- Mm-hmm...

16:21.732 --> 16:23.442
- And here.
- OK.

16:24.485 --> 16:26.945
Where do you want me to start?

16:32.492 --> 16:34.495
Teresa and Christian.

16:34.578 --> 16:38.165
Ha! My pleasure!

16:47.883 --> 16:50.177
- A little one-on-one?
- No.

16:50.260 --> 16:53.430
Come on! Friendly competition,
a little exercise...

16:53.513 --> 16:55.723
I don't got the right shoes. No.

16:57.017 --> 17:00.145
- Where you going after this?
- I'll get a new spot in town.

17:00.228 --> 17:04.858
I don't want to overstep or anything,
but I kind of feel like you should stay.

17:04.942 --> 17:08.362
I paid for my time here, Reggie.
I don't need to lay low anymore.

17:08.444 --> 17:10.238
I know.

17:11.656 --> 17:13.825
I still think you should stay.

17:16.703 --> 17:19.415
- Yeah?
- Nats is dead.

17:21.291 --> 17:23.667
- Who did it?
<i>- I don't know.</i>

17:23.752 --> 17:27.463
Well, Teresa's behind it, so find out
who she's got working on the inside.

17:28.507 --> 17:32.468
- Yeah. Hey, I'm doing the best I can.
<i>- Doing what you can?</i>

17:32.552 --> 17:35.597
I hand-picked you
from the academy, all right?

17:35.680 --> 17:37.975
I taught you everything,
so figure it out.

17:38.058 --> 17:40.018
So figure it out!

17:40.102 --> 17:41.978
What about Teresa? Any leads?

17:42.062 --> 17:45.898
Well, they sent her picture
out to every cop in three provinces.

17:45.982 --> 17:48.027
If we haven't found her yet,
she's probably gone.

17:48.110 --> 17:49.570
<i>Right. Listen...</i>

17:49.653 --> 17:51.988
If they got to Nats,
they're gonna get to Enzo too.

17:52.072 --> 17:54.407
<i>Oh, we got him stashed in a motel.
He's safe, OK?</i>

17:54.492 --> 17:57.870
- Are you still hiding out at the reserve?
<i>- Yeah, but not for long.</i>

17:57.953 --> 17:59.955
Find out who killed Nats!

18:02.582 --> 18:03.792
OK.

18:13.427 --> 18:14.928
Hey, Nellie,

18:15.012 --> 18:17.472
we should go to the prison
to find out what happened.

18:17.555 --> 18:20.975
- It could've been anyone. It's a prison.
- Enzo turns himself in, right?

18:21.058 --> 18:23.978
We know it's Declan who
twisted his arm, but with what?

18:24.062 --> 18:27.023
The one thing Enzo
asked for in return from us

18:27.107 --> 18:29.025
is to transfer his son somewhere safe.

18:31.320 --> 18:34.615
I think Teresa was behind it
to shut them all up.

18:34.698 --> 18:38.577
All right, if we find out who killed him,
maybe it'll bring us closer to her.

18:41.497 --> 18:44.040
All right. Let's go, Tonto!

18:45.625 --> 18:48.462
What, so that makes you...
Lone Ranger?

18:48.545 --> 18:50.255
That's right, Ken!

18:51.507 --> 18:53.883
You know "Tonto's" not
a politically correct nickname.

18:53.967 --> 18:55.885
Keep up, Gollum!

18:55.968 --> 18:58.180
Oh. That's just mean.

19:08.190 --> 19:09.775
What the hell's going on?

19:09.858 --> 19:11.943
- I'm happy you're OK.
<i>- Where's my dad?</i>

19:12.027 --> 19:15.238
- He said we were leaving town!
<i>- You don't have to go anywhere.</i>

19:15.322 --> 19:18.992
We have arranged for your father to leave
the country till things are settled here.

19:19.075 --> 19:23.205
- He wouldn't leave without calling me.
- <i>I'm calling you.</i>

19:23.288 --> 19:27.125
We are taking extra precautions
until the situation is dealt with.

19:27.208 --> 19:30.212
What are you talking about?
How are you gonna deal with it?

19:31.422 --> 19:34.257
Luca, you are in charge now.

19:34.340 --> 19:35.675
<i>You!</i>

19:37.010 --> 19:40.472
If I'm in charge, I wanna know what
you mean by that. Take care of what?

19:42.473 --> 19:44.727
Luca, this is the moment
we talked about.

19:44.810 --> 19:48.647
Do you want to be a general,
or do you want to stay a foot soldier?

19:51.107 --> 19:53.318
Where is my father?

19:54.987 --> 19:57.280
We will let you know
when he is safe.

19:58.657 --> 20:00.742
But I need to know,
where are you now?

20:01.952 --> 20:04.830
- I'm moving around.
<i>- I just want to make sure you are safe.</i>

20:04.913 --> 20:07.832
I'm fine. I'm fine. Where are you?

20:11.002 --> 20:13.047
Don't lose this phone.

20:13.130 --> 20:15.632
This is your only line to me, OK?

20:15.715 --> 20:17.550
I will be in touch.

20:24.933 --> 20:27.852
I need to talk to my client alone.

20:27.937 --> 20:29.938
Yeah, I know the drill.

20:37.903 --> 20:40.948
OK, listen,
we don't have a lot of time.

20:41.032 --> 20:43.243
OK, just give me a second.

20:54.087 --> 20:55.130
Here!

20:56.088 --> 20:59.843
What? I taped it to me. Get your
mind out of the gutter! Come on.

20:59.927 --> 21:01.345
Hurry up.

21:06.140 --> 21:08.518
- Yeah?
<i>- Luca? It's your uncle.</i>

21:08.602 --> 21:10.395
Enzo! Are you OK?

21:10.478 --> 21:13.065
No. I'm going to prison.

21:14.775 --> 21:18.112
<i>- Did your father tell you what's going on?</i>
- Yeah, he told me.

21:18.195 --> 21:20.863
- Where are you?
<i>- I'm at the farm.</i>

21:20.947 --> 21:22.282
Pop told me to wait here.

21:22.365 --> 21:24.685
I got the passports and cash,
but I haven't heard from him.

21:24.743 --> 21:27.370
- You haven't talked to him at all?
<i>- No.</i>

21:27.453 --> 21:29.915
Teresa said they got him
out of the country,

21:29.998 --> 21:33.377
but I can't believe that. He wouldn't
leave without calling me. You know him!

21:37.130 --> 21:40.008
Luca, you listen to me, carefully.

21:40.092 --> 21:42.427
<i>In the deal I made with the cops,</i>

21:42.510 --> 21:44.387
<i>I made sure you can't be touched.</i>

21:44.470 --> 21:46.305
You're free.

21:46.390 --> 21:48.892
They've got nothing on you.
I got it in writing.

21:48.975 --> 21:51.102
<i>I couldn't do anything to help Nats,</i>

21:51.185 --> 21:54.105
<i>but I wasn't gonna let them touch you!</i>

21:55.482 --> 21:58.318
You are to take care
of Adamo now.

21:58.402 --> 22:00.820
You're all we have left.

22:00.903 --> 22:02.530
Keep him safe.

22:02.613 --> 22:04.282
Take him away. Hide.

22:04.365 --> 22:07.243
<i>There's nothing left here
for either of you.</i>

22:10.205 --> 22:12.123
I'll keep him safe. I promise.

22:12.207 --> 22:14.625
<i>And whatever you do...</i>

22:14.710 --> 22:17.420
don't trust those two monsters!

22:17.503 --> 22:20.132
Yeah, we just need another moment.

22:20.215 --> 22:23.510
- Hey, Luca, I gotta go.
- What should I do? Should I wait?

22:23.593 --> 22:25.053
<i>Luca, you can't wait anymore.</i>

22:28.682 --> 22:30.350
Your father's not coming back.

22:31.893 --> 22:35.730
<i>Take Adamo. He's at daycare.
Get him as far away from here as possible.</i>

22:37.357 --> 22:39.650
<i>I gotta go.</i>

22:56.752 --> 22:58.503
My brother's dead.

22:58.587 --> 23:00.963
Oh! I'm so sorry, Enzo!

23:02.340 --> 23:04.843
But you did a good thing
for Luca and your grandson.

23:05.885 --> 23:07.553
No, I didn't.

23:08.638 --> 23:10.848
I made a whole life of bad things.

23:14.978 --> 23:18.190
You'll be fine.
I'll get that thing taken care of.

23:18.273 --> 23:21.860
And I will be in touch soon.

23:35.290 --> 23:38.377
We are to go to Buenos Aires
when we are done, because, um...

23:39.878 --> 23:43.465
they will be looking for me back home,
and that will bring, uh...

23:45.133 --> 23:47.510
unnecessary pressure on my father.

23:55.768 --> 23:59.022
Do you know what he said
when I told him that Christian...

24:07.447 --> 24:10.617
He said, "At least it wasn't you."

24:46.570 --> 24:49.363
- Everything good?
- Smooth as silk!

24:49.447 --> 24:51.198
Load it in my car.

24:51.282 --> 24:52.992
- Hey, let me do the drop.
- Uh-uh.

24:53.075 --> 24:54.827
I'll do as you say.
Let me be your guy.

24:54.912 --> 24:56.453
No. In the car.

25:01.083 --> 25:02.627
OK, you're getting out.

25:02.710 --> 25:05.380
But your brother,
he's got a taste for it now.

25:05.463 --> 25:08.048
It won't be easy for him to back away.
You keep an eye on him.

25:16.348 --> 25:19.102
It's not a good thing to take money
from a man who's going to prison.

25:21.353 --> 25:23.940
I'm not expecting anyone.

25:24.023 --> 25:25.983
Get into the bathroom.

25:46.045 --> 25:47.672
- Rose!
- Yeah?

25:49.132 --> 25:51.342
I'm heading out now.
What are you doing down there?

25:51.425 --> 25:54.303
- Oh... I got a leak.
- Oh!

25:54.387 --> 25:57.473
But I have to lift up the floorboards,
so I need a crowbar.

25:57.557 --> 26:00.310
- I'll get it for you. Where is it?
- It's in the shed. Red toolbox.

26:00.393 --> 26:01.603
Be right back.

26:30.048 --> 26:31.883
- What's this?
- I don't know.

26:31.967 --> 26:34.593
- What's this? What is that?
- I have...

26:34.677 --> 26:36.387
- I've...
- Are you skimming from me?

26:36.470 --> 26:39.223
- No! Of course not!
- Tell me the truth!

26:39.307 --> 26:41.852
- I don't know where that came from!
- From the shed!

26:41.935 --> 26:43.895
This is on your property!
You're stealing from me!

26:43.978 --> 26:45.980
- No! I would never steal from you!
- From <i>me!</i>

26:46.063 --> 26:48.650
I don't even go in that shed!
That's Twix's stuff!

26:56.365 --> 26:59.952
Declan! Declan! Declan, wait!

27:04.498 --> 27:06.500
Declan! Declan!

27:06.583 --> 27:08.293
No! Twix!

27:08.378 --> 27:10.380
Hey, what's going on?

27:10.463 --> 27:13.132
- No! No! No! Stop it!
- You stole from me?

27:13.215 --> 27:15.635
- What are you talking about?
- You stole from me?

27:15.718 --> 27:17.595
- Did you steal from me?
- I'm sorry.

27:17.678 --> 27:21.015
Why would you do that, big man?
Why would you do that? From <i>me?</i>

27:21.098 --> 27:24.102
He's my brother!
Please, Declan! He's my brother!

27:29.690 --> 27:32.235
What shipment did you take it from?

27:32.318 --> 27:34.403
- Only from the bikers.
- Ah! Goddammit!

27:34.487 --> 27:36.298
Theirs was the biggest.
I didn't think they'd notice.

27:36.322 --> 27:39.075
Goddammit! This is on you, baby!
What have I been telling you?

27:39.158 --> 27:43.037
He's with you. He's your blood.
I brought you into this.

27:43.120 --> 27:44.788
Maybe they don't know.

27:44.872 --> 27:47.458
Well, if they did,
then this buy is a trap.

27:47.542 --> 27:49.627
- We'll give it back.
- You don't understand!

27:49.710 --> 27:53.882
You don't understand!
This is on me. It's always on me.

27:54.923 --> 27:56.760
That's how it works.

27:56.843 --> 27:59.303
No one walks from shit like this.

27:59.387 --> 28:01.138
Ah! Don't!

28:01.222 --> 28:03.725
Please! Please! Declan!

28:05.185 --> 28:07.312
Please don't...
Please don't touch him!

28:07.395 --> 28:11.065
You even think of running,
I will hunt you down.

28:12.442 --> 28:14.402
- You got it?
- Uh-huh.

28:23.870 --> 28:26.663
<i>First, let me offer condolences
on the loss of your son.</i>

28:27.957 --> 28:31.795
What I'm working on is getting those
drugs that killed your son off the street.

28:33.672 --> 28:35.798
You were protecting Nats.

28:35.882 --> 28:38.050
Now, we don't care about
the protection racket.

28:38.133 --> 28:41.220
I just wanna know how something like
this could've happened under your watch.

28:42.597 --> 28:44.890
Maybe you're getting pressured.

28:45.892 --> 28:48.060
I can help with that.

28:48.143 --> 28:51.303
Point me in the right direction. I'm happy
to take some bad guys off the street.

28:53.442 --> 28:54.900
Bobby...

28:55.818 --> 28:58.572
I just wanna know who killed Nats.

29:00.030 --> 29:01.698
That's all.

29:11.918 --> 29:13.503
All right.

29:30.270 --> 29:32.938
Declan told me he'd
bring some liquorice soon.

29:34.315 --> 29:37.568
He needs to know
who killed Nats, Bobby.

29:41.948 --> 29:43.575
It was the bikers.

29:48.913 --> 29:50.915
What'd you say to him?

29:52.583 --> 29:55.127
I thought I'd try
something a little different,

29:55.212 --> 29:57.755
offer to get him a day pass.
Still got nothing.

29:57.838 --> 30:00.800
We'll go to his reserve,
see what we can sniff out.

30:02.635 --> 30:04.512
Yeah. Just give me a minute.

30:15.273 --> 30:18.317
<i>Hey, I got it out of Bobby.
It was the bikers.</i>

30:18.400 --> 30:20.653
And Nellie wants to come
to the reserve to ask questions.

30:20.737 --> 30:22.988
Don't let her come here! No one!

30:23.072 --> 30:25.533
<i>- Do you understand?</i>
- Yeah! Yeah!

30:30.497 --> 30:31.788
Nellie!

30:31.873 --> 30:34.208
OK, so Declan must've
gotten Bobby to work for him.

30:34.292 --> 30:36.293
That's the only way
to pressure Enzo or...

30:36.377 --> 30:38.588
- Hey, Nellie!
- What?

30:38.672 --> 30:41.507
Just leave it. It's a dead end.

30:41.590 --> 30:44.468
What do you mean? We'll go to
the reserve, ask questions and get...

30:44.552 --> 30:46.637
No. What are you gonna find out?

30:46.720 --> 30:49.432
He's a guy who lost his son
and runs protection to get by.

30:49.515 --> 30:51.600
It's... There's nothing there.

30:51.683 --> 30:54.270
Look, when I worked in fraud,

30:54.353 --> 30:56.397
we'd follow a trail of money

30:56.480 --> 30:58.692
and numbers and bank accounts
for months and months,

30:58.775 --> 31:02.403
and sometimes,
it just goes nowhere, OK?

31:02.487 --> 31:05.030
That's just how the job is sometimes!

31:07.492 --> 31:10.370
Look, we got Enzo.

31:11.537 --> 31:13.832
And we'll find Teresa.

31:13.915 --> 31:16.708
Take this win and go on
to fight the next fight,

31:16.792 --> 31:20.963
but to kill yourself because you
don't know every little detail, I mean...

31:21.047 --> 31:23.758
You're gonna lose
everything you worked for.

31:24.758 --> 31:26.802
The captain loves you right now.

31:28.345 --> 31:30.682
You get whatever you want, just...

31:33.935 --> 31:36.270
Don't screw it all up, right?

31:37.355 --> 31:39.065
Just leave it.

31:44.570 --> 31:47.490
No. We're going to the reserve.

31:58.292 --> 31:59.460
Yeah?

32:04.965 --> 32:06.050
Yeah.

32:07.260 --> 32:08.343
OK.

32:12.348 --> 32:14.058
Enzo was shot.

32:15.393 --> 32:18.062
We're being ordered back to the station.

32:32.327 --> 32:33.870
Son of a bitch!

32:45.172 --> 32:47.967
Aren't you supposed
to meet the bikers now?

32:50.428 --> 32:52.472
The bikers are working with Teresa.

32:55.057 --> 32:57.227
- How do you know?
- Because I do.

32:59.228 --> 33:01.063
And the buy is a trap.

33:02.565 --> 33:06.027
You trusted me and things
screwed up on my end.

33:06.110 --> 33:07.653
I take full responsibility.

33:07.737 --> 33:10.238
So what can I do now?
How do I make this right?

33:10.322 --> 33:11.990
You can't.

33:13.868 --> 33:17.372
Tomorrow, I'm gonna leave here,
then I'm gonna go to war.

33:35.723 --> 33:38.893
Enzo is dead.
But Declan never showed up.

33:40.102 --> 33:43.147
- Where is he staying?
- At the reserve.

33:43.230 --> 33:46.692
OK. We do this my way now!

33:49.070 --> 33:52.740
You know what?
You should let it go.

33:54.200 --> 33:56.368
You have what you need.

33:56.452 --> 33:58.037
We'll run your fentanyl operation

33:58.120 --> 34:00.056
and distribute everywhere
for you in Quebec and...

34:00.080 --> 34:02.458
I can't bury my brother
because of this man.

34:02.542 --> 34:05.753
I am not going anywhere
until I know he's dead.

34:05.837 --> 34:08.380
Well, Declan doesn't give up easily.

34:08.463 --> 34:10.632
So you'd better put a bullet
in his head yourself.

34:10.717 --> 34:13.092
That's what I plan to do.

34:13.177 --> 34:15.053
Siro, let's go.

34:40.705 --> 34:41.788
Hello?

34:43.917 --> 34:46.460
Twix, is that you?

35:35.843 --> 35:37.803
Put the gun down!

35:42.975 --> 35:45.477
If you wanna see your friends,
you'll put it down.

35:51.150 --> 35:53.193
Yeah, this is it, <i>mon gars.</i>

35:58.448 --> 36:00.075
You're working with her now?

36:00.158 --> 36:02.995
I wouldn't have,
but you broke your word.

36:03.078 --> 36:05.707
You stole from me.

36:12.713 --> 36:14.590
On your knees.

36:16.425 --> 36:19.137
On your knees!

36:23.140 --> 36:24.975
All right. All right.

36:29.688 --> 36:30.857
Reggie...

36:31.857 --> 36:34.443
I'm thinking you might be regretting

36:34.527 --> 36:36.695
having found your uncle, huh?

36:36.778 --> 36:38.447
Not much good has come from it.

36:38.530 --> 36:40.407
It's gonna be OK.

36:41.533 --> 36:44.412
No, Reggie, it will not.

36:45.955 --> 36:49.083
You call yourself a boss?
Let them go. They're innocent.

36:49.167 --> 36:53.963
Come on. Come on, let's settle this,
you and me, like bosses do.

36:55.088 --> 36:57.258
This is between us.

36:58.342 --> 37:00.218
Between us all.

37:07.017 --> 37:10.520
I came to tell you something
before I leave,

37:10.605 --> 37:12.857
so you really understand.

37:17.403 --> 37:21.282
When I was six, my mother, she died.

37:23.283 --> 37:26.537
A week after her funeral, my father,

37:26.620 --> 37:29.082
he sent Christian and I
away to school.

37:29.165 --> 37:31.667
He's an important man, so...

37:33.127 --> 37:36.838
he didn't have time
to raise us or console us.

37:38.465 --> 37:40.467
To this day,

37:40.550 --> 37:43.387
my brother and I have spent

37:43.470 --> 37:46.890
one week a year
with my father, only.

37:46.973 --> 37:48.892
At Easter.

37:51.312 --> 37:54.190
We had no mother, no father.

37:55.273 --> 37:59.737
At school, we would refuse
to share a room with anyone else.

38:02.113 --> 38:03.907
We raised each other.

38:06.410 --> 38:09.747
I don't care. But that explains a lot.

38:09.830 --> 38:10.998
Hmm...

38:13.667 --> 38:15.878
You took him from me.

38:18.130 --> 38:20.298
So now I take from you.

38:32.268 --> 38:33.687
Choose!

38:34.688 --> 38:35.688
W-what?

38:40.110 --> 38:43.322
I will count to three
and then I will choose for you.

38:49.370 --> 38:51.622
You, um... Hang on. Hang on.

38:51.705 --> 38:54.292
You... Oh, you are so gonna die.

38:55.292 --> 38:57.587
Just like the way your brother did.
You are gonna die.

38:57.670 --> 39:00.005
- One...
- Please...

39:02.967 --> 39:04.843
Let them go! Come on!

39:06.053 --> 39:07.763
- Two!
- STOP!

39:08.555 --> 39:10.390
- Three!
- JUST STOP!

39:15.938 --> 39:17.732
Stop! Please!

39:19.275 --> 39:21.568
Please! Teresa.

39:23.112 --> 39:24.822
Take me. Take me.

39:24.905 --> 39:28.033
Please, just take me. Take me!
They're innocent.

39:28.117 --> 39:30.702
That wasn't the choice,
so I will choose for you.

39:32.788 --> 39:33.997
Wait!

39:35.082 --> 39:36.250
It's OK.

39:36.333 --> 39:37.710
Reggie, quiet!

39:37.793 --> 39:40.003
- It's OK.
- No, no!

39:41.005 --> 39:42.380
So be it.

39:42.465 --> 39:45.885
Aaah! No! Aaah!

39:49.805 --> 39:51.932
Oh no!

40:19.083 --> 40:21.337
Now you understand.

40:25.340 --> 40:28.927
Ah! No! No, no, no!

40:52.325 --> 40:55.245
Please! I won't say anything!

40:55.328 --> 40:58.915
I want you to know...
I don't like this.

40:58.998 --> 41:01.460
But I have no choice.

41:01.543 --> 41:02.878
Uhh!

41:06.715 --> 41:09.302
Twix! Twix!

41:09.385 --> 41:10.802
Twix!

41:14.097 --> 41:16.017
- Rose...
- Declan?

42:51.653 --> 42:55.865
<i>Rose told the cops that
her brother was stealing from the bikers,</i>

42:55.950 --> 42:58.452
<i>and that I had nothing to do with it.</i>

42:58.535 --> 43:01.747
<i>She even hid the 20 keys of coke
I had in my car before they got there.</i>

43:03.832 --> 43:06.752
<i>That was the last time I saw Rose.</i>

43:06.835 --> 43:11.465

or forgiven between people.</i>

43:14.510 --> 43:17.428
<i>With everyone dead
and no case to make,</i>

43:17.512 --> 43:21.142
<i>Nellie's division got shut down.
They transferred her to fraud.</i>

43:21.225 --> 43:23.768

43:35.655 --> 43:39.618

the walls of the mother's womb,</i>

43:39.702 --> 43:41.953

43:58.428 --> 44:00.472
