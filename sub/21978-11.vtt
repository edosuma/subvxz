01:24.106 --> 01:25.608
All right !

01:25.609 --> 01:28.381
Way to go !

01:28.382 --> 01:31.186
The space turtle that ate Tokyo.

01:31.187 --> 01:32.757
Now, that's my kind of flick.

01:32.758 --> 01:35.997
Yeah. They sure don't make

01:35.998 --> 01:38.101
love stories the way they used to.

01:38.102 --> 01:40.607
Hey, speaking of love stories,
Michelangelo,

01:40.608 --> 01:42.411
tells us all about
the romance you had

01:42.412 --> 01:44.114
with that neutrino chick, Kala.

01:44.115 --> 01:48.791
Who, us ? Oh, we were
just good friends.

01:48.792 --> 01:52.065
Sure you were.
Like Romeo and Juliet.

01:52.066 --> 01:56.307
No, honest, dudes.
I never even think of her at all.

01:56.308 --> 01:58.846
Well, hardly ever.

02:00.951 --> 02:02.988
So, like, what's the plan, man ?

02:02.989 --> 02:05.660
Let's keep on cruising
and grooving, Kala.

02:05.661 --> 02:07.665
Hey, dig that scene.

02:07.666 --> 02:09.167
The Technodrome.

02:09.168 --> 02:11.106
All reet !
Let's buzz them.

02:11.107 --> 02:14.445
Let's not and say we did.
That place is bad news.

02:14.446 --> 02:17.919
Zack, don't be chicken.
It'll be a blast.

02:23.198 --> 02:25.971
Hey, there's an open
cargo bay up ahead.

02:25.972 --> 02:28.042
Solid, Zack.
Let's check it out.

02:28.043 --> 02:29.545
I don't know about this.

02:29.546 --> 02:31.983
Remember what happened
to us last time ?

02:31.984 --> 02:33.988
Sure, it sent us to earth.

02:33.989 --> 02:37.061
And I met Michelangelo.

02:37.062 --> 02:39.733
I still don't think
this is such a cool idea.

02:39.734 --> 02:41.637
Let's see what's up.

02:42.774 --> 02:46.247
Calling Shredder.
Krang calling Shredder.

02:46.248 --> 02:48.185
What's happening ?

02:48.186 --> 02:51.357
Looks like we tapped into the 
interdimensional transmission.

02:51.358 --> 02:52.594
I am here, Krang.

02:52.595 --> 02:55.100
The mento-neutralizer is ready.

02:55.101 --> 02:59.108
I will open the portal in 60 seconds.

02:59.109 --> 03:01.313
You're certain this will work ?

03:01.314 --> 03:04.085
Trust me.
Now remember,

03:04.086 --> 03:08.261
the device will only operate
on a precise frequency

03:08.262 --> 03:11.334
of 10 trillion megahertz.

03:11.335 --> 03:14.241
Oh, wow ! That's the same frequency

03:14.242 --> 03:17.180
that transdimensional
hypersignal in our car works on.

03:17.181 --> 03:20.186
Jeepers creepers !
What a weird coincidence.

03:20.187 --> 03:21.422
Well ?

03:21.423 --> 03:23.793
I'm opening the portal.

03:34.818 --> 03:38.225
Excellent ! Once inside
the mento-neutralizer,

03:38.226 --> 03:41.131
Those turtles will
become mindless zombies.

03:41.132 --> 03:42.467
Nothing personal.

03:42.468 --> 03:45.340
Sounds like trouble in turtletown.

03:45.341 --> 03:48.346
Once we bring them back
through the portal,

03:48.347 --> 03:50.851
we'll put them on exhibit here

03:50.852 --> 03:55.529
like the mutant freaks they are. 

03:55.530 --> 03:57.199
This is seriously uncool !

03:57.200 --> 03:58.970
We must warn our friends
the turtles !

03:58.971 --> 04:00.740
Hey, dig this !

04:00.741 --> 04:02.911
If our hypersignal works
on the same frequency,

04:02.912 --> 04:05.985
We can use it to cancel out
that gizmo's waves.

04:05.986 --> 04:08.022
All reet !
Let's beat feet !

04:12.466 --> 04:14.369
Something tells me
we've worn out our welcome.

04:16.975 --> 04:20.115
Intruders in the technodrome ?

04:21.886 --> 04:25.192
It's those accursed neutrinos !

04:27.665 --> 04:29.669
Let's blow this place
and head for earth.

04:29.670 --> 04:31.204
Activate the hypersignal.

04:32.375 --> 04:36.115
Shredder, the neutrinos
have just opened

04:36.116 --> 04:38.186
their own portal to earth.

04:38.187 --> 04:41.694
Stop them before
they join the turtles.

04:41.695 --> 04:43.197
Will do.

04:43.198 --> 04:47.606
So, those teenagers are able to 
open portals, are they ?

04:47.607 --> 04:50.546
That could prove
most useful to me.

04:50.547 --> 04:54.020
It's no use, guys !
Looking for the turtles in this city

04:54.021 --> 04:56.492
is like trying to find a quark in
an asteroid field.

04:56.493 --> 04:57.995
Zack's right.

04:57.996 --> 04:59.999
Maybe we can make
the turtles find us.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.169
How do we do that ?

05:01.170 --> 05:04.042
That's how ! If we can
get on the news,

05:04.043 --> 05:06.213
the turtles are sure to see us.

05:06.214 --> 05:08.351
Solid ! Let's do it !

05:14.632 --> 05:16.535
Don't just stand there,

05:16.536 --> 05:18.907
somebody get a videocam
on that thing.

05:18.908 --> 05:20.811
You, too, Vernon !

05:20.812 --> 05:22.548
We need all the coverage
we can get !

05:22.549 --> 05:25.722
April, where do you think 
you're going ?

05:25.723 --> 05:27.726
This is the story of the year.

05:27.727 --> 05:29.897
Don't you think
you should be covering it ?

05:29.898 --> 05:33.204
As soon as I powder
my nose, Bern.

05:33.205 --> 05:35.409
I must look good for
my public, you know.

05:42.492 --> 05:43.993
What is it, April ?

05:43.994 --> 05:46.666
The neutrinos !
They're buzzing the building.

05:46.667 --> 05:48.671
The neutrinos are back ?

05:48.672 --> 05:52.579
I thought we'd seen the last of those
crazy mixed-up kids.

05:52.580 --> 05:55.752
I guess Kala just
couldn't stay away.

05:55.753 --> 05:58.625
Let's go. We'll take the turtle blimp.

06:00.263 --> 06:02.767
What you doing, boss ?

06:02.768 --> 06:05.940
Checking for news reports, fool.

06:05.941 --> 06:08.780
If the media has gotten
wind of those neutrinos...

06:08.781 --> 06:11.252
We interrupt this program
for a special bulletin.

06:11.253 --> 06:13.790
A strange craft has been
sighted over the city.

06:13.791 --> 06:17.699
They're at the channel 6
building. Come on !

06:19.069 --> 06:21.641
Look ! There's the starmobile.

06:21.642 --> 06:23.646
How do I look ?

06:23.647 --> 06:25.081
The same as always.

06:25.082 --> 06:27.587
Oh, I was afraid of that.

06:27.588 --> 06:29.658
Hi, guys !
What's cooking ?

06:29.659 --> 06:32.230
Your goose ! If Shredder
gets his claws on you.

06:32.231 --> 06:34.702
Shredder ?
What's he up to now ?

06:34.703 --> 06:38.209
The cat's got a brand-new weapon.
It's called a...

06:57.318 --> 06:59.154
Shredder's got the neutrinos !

07:01.327 --> 07:04.265
What's going on, Donatello ?
We're losing them !

07:04.266 --> 07:07.573
Too many thermal updrafts.
I can't control the glider.

07:10.580 --> 07:14.120
Well, this is another fine mess
you've gotten us into.

07:14.121 --> 07:16.258
But on the bright side...

07:16.259 --> 07:19.699
it wouldn't make a bad pizza sauce.

07:20.869 --> 07:21.870
What do we do now ?

07:21.871 --> 07:24.041
Shredder's got the neutrinos.

07:24.042 --> 07:26.546
And mostly, they got Kala !

07:26.547 --> 07:28.316
We'll find them, Michelangelo.

07:28.317 --> 07:32.225
Somehow, some way,
we'll find them.

07:36.803 --> 07:38.539
Hey, loosen up, man.

07:38.540 --> 07:40.042
You're wearing
a hole in the floor.

07:40.043 --> 07:42.280
Raphael is right, Michelangelo.

07:42.281 --> 07:45.987
One must be like the willow that 
bends with the storm.

07:45.988 --> 07:48.894
Oh, yeah, I could dig
where you're coming from.

07:48.895 --> 07:50.832
You got to be Zen.

07:58.416 --> 08:00.920
Well, so much for relaxing with Zen.

08:02.959 --> 08:04.661
Take a look at this !

08:04.662 --> 08:06.766
It'll let us zip through the sewers.

08:06.767 --> 08:08.837
And it cost practically
nothing to build.

08:08.838 --> 08:11.142
That's why I called it
"the cheapskate."

08:11.143 --> 08:12.912
And this gadget will
let us track the neutrinos

08:12.913 --> 08:15.584
by their extradimensional auras.

08:15.585 --> 08:18.458
Like, what are we waiting for ?

08:18.459 --> 08:20.662
Let's haul shell !

08:20.663 --> 08:22.633
Good luck, turtles.

08:27.678 --> 08:29.949
Look who's awake !

08:29.950 --> 08:32.419
Hey, what's happening, cats ?

08:32.421 --> 08:38.400
You'll find out when Shredder 
gets here.

08:38.400 --> 08:40.672
I am here, you cretin !

08:40.673 --> 08:43.510
I want the device you used to open

08:43.511 --> 08:45.081
the portal to Dimension X,

08:45.082 --> 08:46.818
and I want it now !

08:46.819 --> 08:49.757
Tough tamales, can head.
We don't have it.

08:49.758 --> 08:52.597
Do not play games with me, brat !

08:52.598 --> 08:54.000
It's true, daddy-o !

08:54.001 --> 08:55.503
The transdimensional hypersignal

08:55.504 --> 08:57.174
is built into our starmobile.

08:57.175 --> 09:00.681
Did you hear that ?
I command you to find that car !

09:00.682 --> 09:03.687
Right, boss.
Right, boss.

09:03.688 --> 09:07.963
It's so hard to find
decent help nowadays.

09:09.033 --> 09:11.704
Cowabunga !

09:11.705 --> 09:14.243
Any sign of them, Donatello ?

09:14.244 --> 09:16.247
I'm picking up
a strong signal dead ahead.

09:16.248 --> 09:20.858
All right ! Man, this cheapskate
is totally awesome !

09:22.261 --> 09:25.768
Next time, you bring up the rear.

09:25.769 --> 09:28.741
Well, where is that car ?

09:28.742 --> 09:30.445
Too late, boss.

09:30.446 --> 09:33.384
The city had it towed away.

09:33.385 --> 09:36.591
Towed away ?
What else can go wrong ?

09:40.767 --> 09:42.570
It's the turtles !

09:42.571 --> 09:45.042
This guy's sharp as a bowling ball,
isn't he ?

09:49.152 --> 09:50.922
Surrender, Shredder,

09:50.923 --> 09:53.761
Or face the consequences
of your actions.

09:53.762 --> 09:57.168
Don't you just love it
when he talks like that ?

09:57.169 --> 09:59.374
Fools ! In a matter of moments,

09:59.375 --> 10:02.013
you will be mindless slaves.
Take them !

10:08.794 --> 10:10.798
Bad scene !

10:10.799 --> 10:12.869
We've gotta do something
to help those amphibs.

10:12.870 --> 10:15.307
I got just the thing.

10:18.415 --> 10:19.917
What ?

10:22.557 --> 10:26.297
Hey, dask, that's some great gadget.

10:26.298 --> 10:29.237
Yeah ! I picked it up at
a venusian garage sale.

10:29.238 --> 10:31.308
Hop aboard, Kala.

10:31.309 --> 10:33.412
I mean, dudes.

10:33.413 --> 10:35.016
Solid notion.

10:35.017 --> 10:37.021
Hang on.

10:37.022 --> 10:40.360
Cowabunga !

10:44.471 --> 10:47.042
Oh, gee, that sure was fun.

10:47.043 --> 10:49.781
Can we go again, boss ?

10:52.789 --> 10:56.295
So, like, how are
We gonna scope out
Their wheels ?

10:56.296 --> 10:58.800
Simple. I'll readjust
The tracking module

10:58.801 --> 11:00.905
To pick up
The starmobile's
Emissions.

11:05.549 --> 11:07.987
Ok, the coast is clear.

11:09.056 --> 11:10.893
There it is.

11:10.894 --> 11:14.100
Do you think you morons
Can get it now ?

11:15.570 --> 11:18.843
No ! It can't be !
Stop them !

11:21.583 --> 11:23.687
Boy, i hope
We got enough fuel.

11:23.688 --> 11:26.426
No problem. We filled up
Just outside andromeda.

11:30.536 --> 11:33.841
They got away, boss.

11:33.842 --> 11:36.480
Oh, it's not fair !

11:36.481 --> 11:38.852
It's just not fair !

11:38.853 --> 11:40.356
Isn't it a blast ?

11:40.357 --> 11:43.596
Our hypersignal
Can zap out krang's
Mento-neutralizer.

11:43.597 --> 11:46.235
How does
This hypersignal
Of yours work ?

11:46.236 --> 11:47.438
Nothing to it.

11:47.439 --> 11:50.043
You just flip
This chrome-plated
Switch and...

11:50.044 --> 11:52.014
That's weird.
Nothing happened.

11:52.015 --> 11:53.851
Serves you right
For buying

11:53.852 --> 11:55.355
These cheap
Outerdimensional imports.

11:56.993 --> 11:58.294
No wonder it won't work.

11:58.295 --> 12:00.699
The crylithium crystal
Power source is broken.

12:00.700 --> 12:03.038
It must've happened
During the crash.

12:03.039 --> 12:05.376
We can't open
The portal without it !

12:05.377 --> 12:08.283
And the crystals
Only exist
In dimension x !

12:08.284 --> 12:11.890
No problemo, dudes !
We'll build one.

12:11.891 --> 12:13.694
Yeah, yeah, sure.
All we need

12:13.695 --> 12:16.466
Is a neighborhood
Particle accelerator
To crack the crystals.

12:16.467 --> 12:18.938
Hey, i only
Think of the ideas.

12:18.939 --> 12:20.809
It's your job
To carry them out.

12:20.810 --> 12:24.150
Hold on !
I know where there's
A particle accelerator.

12:24.151 --> 12:27.857
Well, what are
We waiting for ?
Let's get cracking !

12:27.858 --> 12:29.861
Man, even
The swat team's afraid

12:29.862 --> 12:31.799
To visit this part of town.

12:32.936 --> 12:34.872
Trust me.
Come on.

12:42.623 --> 12:45.528
Awesome !

12:45.529 --> 12:48.534
Man, what
A far out place !

12:48.536 --> 12:51.475
You were right, guys !
Dig that crazy cyclotron !

12:51.476 --> 12:53.011
How groovy
that you knew about

12:53.012 --> 12:54.481
this sewer line, Michelangelo.

12:54.482 --> 12:59.592
Oh, for sure.
Groovy like a movie.

12:59.593 --> 13:00.962
Are you sure this
Is going to work ?

13:00.963 --> 13:03.166
Positive.
All we have to do

13:03.167 --> 13:04.903
Is bombard the crystal
With betron rays

13:04.904 --> 13:07.308
And it'll be good as new.

13:07.309 --> 13:08.779
Of course,
If anything goes wrong,

13:08.780 --> 13:10.749
We'll all be radiated
To a crisp.

13:10.750 --> 13:13.655
Oh, swell.
I've wanted
Work on my tan.

13:23.510 --> 13:25.414
Keep your fingers crossed.

13:29.858 --> 13:32.930
Uh-oh. It's heating up
Too rapidly.

13:32.931 --> 13:35.035
I--i can't control it !

13:35.036 --> 13:37.039
It's going to blow !

13:43.487 --> 13:45.490
It's about to explode !

13:45.491 --> 13:46.993
Oh, brother !
This is worse

13:46.994 --> 13:49.599
Than being grounded
For an entire light year !

13:49.600 --> 13:51.202
Any ideas ?

13:51.203 --> 13:53.875
Yeah. I say
We blow this joint

13:53.876 --> 13:55.879
Before this joint
Blows us !

13:55.880 --> 13:58.251
Krang !
What do you want ?

13:58.252 --> 14:01.825
To help you
Find the turtles
And the neutrinos

14:01.826 --> 14:05.533
Since you seem
Incapable of
Doing so yourself.

14:05.534 --> 14:07.103
You know where
They are ?

14:07.104 --> 14:11.479
My instruments
Have just registered
A huge power surge

14:11.480 --> 14:15.888
So strong that it penetrated
The dimensional barrier.

14:15.889 --> 14:17.725
Tell me !
Where is it ?

14:17.726 --> 14:19.797
Beneath
A street-covered area

14:19.798 --> 14:23.070
In the northeast sector
Of the city.

14:24.474 --> 14:25.910
Come with me.

14:27.882 --> 14:31.322
I think
I'm getting it
Under control.

14:31.323 --> 14:32.892
All reet !

14:32.893 --> 14:36.600
Donatello, you sure
Have a flair for
The dramatic.

14:36.601 --> 14:40.040
Hey, look ! The gizmo's
Charged up again.

14:40.041 --> 14:42.879
Now all we have
To do is get it back
To the starmobile.

14:42.880 --> 14:45.485
I'd follow you
Anywhere.

14:50.396 --> 14:51.965
We found them !

14:51.966 --> 14:53.902
It's the neutrinos'
Starmobile !

14:53.903 --> 14:58.546
Why would anybody build
A fancy cyclo-whatever--

14:58.547 --> 15:00.985
In a dump like this ?

15:00.986 --> 15:03.556
Because
If it ever blows up,

15:03.557 --> 15:05.962
No one would care
What happens to
The neighborhood.

15:05.963 --> 15:08.134
Now come along !

15:15.483 --> 15:18.021
Halt !
Identify yourself.

15:18.022 --> 15:19.391
Certainly.

15:19.392 --> 15:21.562
Identify us, bebop.

15:29.747 --> 15:31.349
Ok, got it !

15:31.350 --> 15:33.020
Then, let's
Get out of here !

15:34.691 --> 15:39.701
Hey, boss, how come
You know so much
About this place ?

15:39.702 --> 15:42.139
I bet you
Krang told him.

15:42.140 --> 15:44.946
Quiet, mutant !
Open that door now !

15:47.719 --> 15:49.822
Man !
What was that ?

15:49.823 --> 15:53.598
I don't know,
But that's one
Crazy doorbell.

16:03.286 --> 16:05.723
The turtles !
They're in trouble !

16:07.796 --> 16:09.164
At last !

16:09.165 --> 16:12.638
Now i can open a portal
To dimension x on my own.

16:12.639 --> 16:14.241
With the turtles
As my captives,

16:14.242 --> 16:18.217
I'll show

16:18.218 --> 16:21.891
What do you want us to do
With these clowns, boss ?

16:21.892 --> 16:23.194
Leave them.

16:23.195 --> 16:25.799
The vermin that live here
Will finish them off.

16:30.911 --> 16:34.953
Can't you slow down
A little, boss ?

16:34.954 --> 16:37.692
I can't stand
A backseat driver !

16:41.701 --> 16:45.107
I feel like
We were run over by
A star destroyer !

16:45.108 --> 16:47.179
The turtles !
They're gone !

16:47.180 --> 16:49.016
Split city !

16:49.017 --> 16:51.087
Shredder
Must've got them.

16:51.088 --> 16:53.993
Man, what a drag !

16:55.697 --> 16:59.372
Climb in, neutrinos.
This is not a friendly
Neighborhood.

16:59.373 --> 17:00.641
Now she tells us !

17:04.684 --> 17:06.185
Who are you ?

17:06.185 --> 17:08.657
A friend
Of the turtles.
Where are they ?

17:08.659 --> 17:10.395
Tin skin's got them.

17:10.396 --> 17:13.402
Shredder ?
I might have known.

17:13.403 --> 17:15.003
How'd you find us anyway ?

17:15.005 --> 17:17.676
Simple. I followed
The turtlecom signal.

17:17.678 --> 17:19.682
We've got to find
The turtles

17:19.683 --> 17:21.919
Before that creep uses
His mento-neutralizer on them.

17:21.920 --> 17:24.425
Jeepers, what was that ?

17:24.425 --> 17:27.932
This whole area's
Run by a gang called
The cyber-punks,

17:27.933 --> 17:30.404
And they don't take
Kindly to strangers.

17:31.674 --> 17:34.580
Hang on ! We'll try
To outrun them.

17:43.967 --> 17:45.603
W-where are we ?

17:45.604 --> 17:49.612
Close to the end
Of your miserable
Mutant existence !

17:49.613 --> 17:52.853
Would you like
To see what i have
In store for you ?

17:52.854 --> 17:55.625
Rock-steady, bebop, now !

17:58.298 --> 18:00.368
What's that thing ?

18:00.369 --> 18:02.774
I'm hoping it's
A piece of modern art,

18:02.775 --> 18:04.244
But somehow i doubt it.

18:04.245 --> 18:07.250
Put them in
The mento-neutralizer.

18:07.251 --> 18:10.156
Pimento naturalizer ?

18:10.157 --> 18:13.163
Sounds like something
You put on a pizza.

18:13.164 --> 18:15.735
Oh, we should
Only be so lucky.

18:15.736 --> 18:18.741
While your brains
Are being drained,

18:18.742 --> 18:20.278
I will activate the portal.

18:23.986 --> 18:27.126
Did he say
Brain drain ?

18:27.127 --> 18:29.030
Oh, bummer.

18:29.031 --> 18:31.034
Don't sweat it,
Michelangelo.

18:31.035 --> 18:32.637
You don't have
That much to lose.

18:34.042 --> 18:36.278
I think
We're losing them.

18:38.417 --> 18:40.421
An overturned
Earth vehicle !

18:45.566 --> 18:49.340
This is cyber-punk turf,
And you're on it !

18:49.341 --> 18:52.079
Well, we just came
For a few pictures.

18:52.080 --> 18:54.417
Watch the birdie.

18:58.059 --> 19:00.029
Quick ! Run for it !

19:02.602 --> 19:04.539
Why are you
Doing that ?

19:04.540 --> 19:06.877
Hey, it worked
For the turtles.

19:09.117 --> 19:11.353
Hey ! Where'd they go ?

19:16.132 --> 19:17.800
What in blazes ?

19:17.801 --> 19:20.139
What's wrong, boss ?

19:20.140 --> 19:22.611
I...i can't move.

19:22.612 --> 19:24.848
Now's our chance
To escape.

19:24.849 --> 19:27.087
Yeah.
Let's hop to it.

19:29.493 --> 19:32.465
Hey. They're
Getting away.

19:32.466 --> 19:35.338
Not for long.

19:35.339 --> 19:39.113
This'll be like shooting
Turtles in a barrel.

19:46.029 --> 19:48.032
Ha ! You didn't
Take into account

19:48.033 --> 19:50.437
Our prodigious
Ninja dexterity.

19:50.438 --> 19:53.076
Yeah, like,
What he said.

19:53.077 --> 19:57.686
Big deal.
We still got these.

19:57.687 --> 20:00.292
But not for long.

20:01.896 --> 20:03.197
You were saying ?

20:07.741 --> 20:11.749
Never mind me, you fools.
Capture those turtles.

20:11.750 --> 20:13.853
I don't think
You'll have time, shredder.

20:15.258 --> 20:16.927
Look who's coming.

20:16.928 --> 20:19.933
Cyber-punks !

20:19.934 --> 20:22.873
They fight dirtier
Than we do.

20:30.925 --> 20:33.429
April !
What are you doing here ?

20:33.430 --> 20:35.300
No time
To explain now.

20:35.301 --> 20:36.702
As the neutrinos
Would say--

20:36.703 --> 20:39.642
Let's hit
The road, jack !

20:49.531 --> 20:51.601
So what was that force field

20:51.602 --> 20:53.639
That stopped shredder
From opening the portal ?

20:53.640 --> 20:56.879
It was our car alarm.
We set it to stop anybody

20:56.880 --> 20:58.750
Who might try to use
The hypersignal.

20:58.751 --> 21:00.554
Now, remember,
You cats fall by

21:00.555 --> 21:01.823
If you're ever
In our dimension.

21:01.824 --> 21:03.260
I can see us now--

21:03.261 --> 21:05.464
The first turtles to
Break the sound barrier.

21:05.465 --> 21:07.569
I'm gonna miss
You guys.

21:07.570 --> 21:10.141
Especially you, Michelangelo.

21:10.142 --> 21:12.145
Yeah. Likewise.

21:12.146 --> 21:15.051
That's why I brought you
a little going-away present.

21:15.052 --> 21:17.690
Oh, wow !
An earth pizza !

21:17.691 --> 21:19.227
That's really cool.

21:19.228 --> 21:21.599
Did you say cool ?
Hot !

21:26.743 --> 21:30.751
I'll probably never
get to see Kala again.

21:30.752 --> 21:32.222
Look on the bright side, pal.

21:32.223 --> 21:33.591
You haven't lost a girlfriend,

21:33.592 --> 21:35.996
you've gained an extra
portion of pizza.

21:35.997 --> 21:39.804
You know something, you're right !
