WEBVTT

00:06.040 --> 00:08.476
Male voice:
PREVIOUSLY ON "IN TREATMENT"...

00:08.576 --> 00:12.246
WE JUST ARGUE NONSTOP.
I THINK IT'S BEGINNING
TO AFFECT MY WORK.

00:12.346 --> 00:15.783
IF THEY WERE TO DIAGNOSE
THERAPISTS WHOSE MARRIAGES
FELL APART,

00:15.883 --> 00:19.553
HOW MANY CASES OF EROTIC
TRANSFERENCE WOULD THEY FIND?

00:19.653 --> 00:23.191
I DON'T THINK MY MARRIAGE
TO KATE IS FALLING APART.

00:23.291 --> 00:25.159
YES, I HAD A ROW
WITH LAURA--

00:25.259 --> 00:27.195
I MEAN WITH KATE.

00:27.295 --> 00:30.598
- WHO'S LAURA?
- THE GIRL WITH THE ISSUE OF...

00:30.698 --> 00:32.400
EROTIC TRANSFERENCE.

00:32.500 --> 00:35.035
GINA, I DIDN'T COME HERE
TO TALK ABOUT A PATIENT.

00:35.136 --> 00:38.172
DID YOU COME HERE TO ASK
FOR MY GUIDANCE?

00:38.272 --> 00:40.040
OR TO TALK TO ME
AS A FRIEND?

00:40.141 --> 00:42.276
ARE YOU SEEKING ADVICE
FROM A COLLEAGUE?

00:42.376 --> 00:44.378
WHAT ROLE HAVE YOU
ASSIGNED ME?

00:44.478 --> 00:47.648
I'M TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT,
BUT I'M FAILING!

00:50.584 --> 00:52.686
( phone ringing )

01:01.629 --> 01:03.531
HELLO.

01:03.631 --> 01:06.667
NO, HE'S NOT HERE.
PLEASE DON'T CALL BACK.

01:08.035 --> 01:10.738
BECAUSE HE'S DEAD.
HE DIED A YEAR AGO.

01:33.994 --> 01:36.230
( theme music playing )

01:52.946 --> 01:55.683
WELL, THANK YOU FOR GETTING
BACK TO ME, AMY. I--

01:55.783 --> 01:57.918
I APPRECIATE IT.

01:58.018 --> 01:59.787
MM-HMM.

02:01.389 --> 02:03.624
SO I'LL SEE YOU
NEXT WEEK THEN.

02:04.825 --> 02:06.660
SAME TIME, YEAH.

02:06.760 --> 02:08.662
THANK YOU.
BYE.

02:18.972 --> 02:20.808
HI.

02:27.080 --> 02:29.683
( coughing, sniffles )

02:33.987 --> 02:35.889
IT'S, UH--

02:35.989 --> 02:38.892
IT'S TRUE.

02:38.992 --> 02:41.595
KATE'S BEEN--

02:43.497 --> 02:45.899
SHE'S BEEN SEEING...
( sighs )

02:45.999 --> 02:48.101
THIS GUY.

02:48.202 --> 02:50.438
SUPERMARKET MANAGER,

02:50.538 --> 02:54.041
EMPLOYMENT AGENCY GUY--
I FORGET WHAT HE DOES,

02:54.141 --> 02:56.510
BUT ANYWAY, HE'S DIVORCED,

02:56.610 --> 02:59.747
GOT A KID.

03:01.482 --> 03:03.717
SHE MADE SURE TO TELL ME
ALL THE DETAILS.

03:05.986 --> 03:07.688
TA-DA.

03:10.023 --> 03:11.992
HMM.

03:12.092 --> 03:13.761
DID SHE SAY HOW LONG?

03:13.861 --> 03:17.097
EVERYTHING'S GONE TO HELL--
PATIENTS, FAMILY.

03:17.197 --> 03:20.668
IF I WAS-- IF I WAS INTO

03:20.768 --> 03:23.537
ASTROLOGY, I'D SAY
THERE WAS SOMETHING

03:23.637 --> 03:28.409
COSMIC GOING ON,
PLANETS COLLIDING SOMEWHERE.

03:29.477 --> 03:32.346
UM, FIRST, YOU KNOW,
ONE OF MY PATIENTS--

03:32.446 --> 03:34.482
THE PILOT I WAS
TELLING YOU ABOUT--

03:34.582 --> 03:37.418
HE'S LEAVING HIS WIFE.
JUST LIKE THAT.

03:37.518 --> 03:40.220
SHE GRINDS HER TEETH
IN HER SLEEP,

03:40.321 --> 03:42.256
SO MARRIAGE OVER.
( snorts )

03:42.356 --> 03:45.192
AND THE 16-YEAR-OLD,
THE GYMNAST?

03:45.293 --> 03:47.194
SHE'S HAVING AN AFFAIR

03:47.295 --> 03:50.063
WITH THIS GUY IN HIS MID-40s,
MARRIED GUY--

03:50.163 --> 03:51.799
HER COACH.

03:51.899 --> 03:54.001
AT LEAST I THINK THAT'S
WHAT SHE'S HINTING AT.

03:54.101 --> 03:57.338
AND SHE ALSO GOES TO THE SAME
SCHOOL AS MY DAUGHTER

03:57.438 --> 04:01.342
SO I HAD THE PLEASURE
OF FINDING OUT THAT

04:01.442 --> 04:04.144
ROSIE WAS HAVING A--
A THING

04:04.244 --> 04:07.014
WITH THIS BOY AT SCHOOL.

04:07.114 --> 04:09.450
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT A THING IS.

04:09.550 --> 04:12.686
I DON'T EVEN
KNOW IF IT'S TRUE.
I ASKED HER.

04:12.786 --> 04:15.556
I GOT NOWHERE.
SHE WOULDN'T TELL ME ANYTHING.

04:17.925 --> 04:19.927
AND THEN FINALLY...

04:20.027 --> 04:22.730
( sighs )

04:22.830 --> 04:25.032
KATE.

04:29.837 --> 04:32.406
IS IT ME?

04:33.474 --> 04:36.644
KATE SAYS IT IS.
SHE SAYS IT'S MY FAULT;

04:36.744 --> 04:39.980
I DON'T SEE HER,
THAT'S SHE'S INVISIBLE.

04:40.080 --> 04:42.215
SHE SAYS I DON'T SEE
THE KIDS EITHER;

04:42.316 --> 04:43.817
THEY'RE INVISIBLE TOO.

04:43.917 --> 04:46.520
AS FAR AS I KNOW, ROSIE COULD
BE HAVING SEX WITH

04:46.620 --> 04:49.757
A DRUG ADDICT.
EVERYBODY TALKS ABOUT
HER AT SCHOOL--

04:49.857 --> 04:53.260
- AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID.
- WHO SAID? KATE SAID THAT?

04:53.361 --> 04:55.329
- NO, UM...
- I'M LOST, PAUL.

04:55.429 --> 04:57.898
THE GIRL, SOPHIE--
THE GYMNAST.

04:57.998 --> 05:00.000
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT 10 THINGS AT ONCE.

05:00.100 --> 05:03.637
- NO, SHE'S IN THE
SAME GRADE AS ROSIE.
- LET'S FOCUS ON KATE.

05:08.876 --> 05:11.745
( sniffling )

05:14.314 --> 05:16.817
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO DO, GINA?

05:18.118 --> 05:20.421
I MEAN, WHAT

05:20.521 --> 05:22.222
AM I SUPPOSED TO DO

05:22.322 --> 05:24.392
NOW?

05:27.895 --> 05:31.765
DID SHE SAY WHAT SHE THINKS
WILL HAPPEN NOW BETWEEN
THE TWO OF YOU?

05:33.266 --> 05:35.068
I DON'T KNOW.
SHE SAID IT'S--

05:35.168 --> 05:36.637
SHE SAID IT'S UP TO ME.

05:36.737 --> 05:38.706
- WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT MEANS?
- YOU TELL ME.

05:38.806 --> 05:41.108
SHE'S BANGING SOME
INSURANCE SALESMAN

05:41.208 --> 05:42.743
AND IT'S UP TO ME?

05:42.843 --> 05:46.346
SHE GAVE ME ALL THE DETAILS.
SHE BLOWS HIM, SHE SCREWS HIM.

05:46.447 --> 05:49.316
IT'S LIKE--
IT'S LIKE A PORNO FILM.

05:49.417 --> 05:51.419
- SHE TOLD YOU THAT?
- ABSOLUTELY.

05:51.519 --> 05:53.854
- WHY?
- YOU KNOW, MY CONCEPTION--

05:53.954 --> 05:58.125
WELL, MAYBE I SHOULD SAY
MY MISCONCEPTION OF KATE

05:58.225 --> 06:00.360
IS THAT EVERYTHING--

06:00.461 --> 06:01.962
EVERYTHING ABOUT SEX

06:02.062 --> 06:05.666
WAS ALWAYS CONNECTED
TO INTIMACY FOR HER.

06:05.766 --> 06:08.636
THERE WAS NEVER ANYTHING
WEIRD OR DIRTY ABOUT SEX.

06:08.736 --> 06:11.672
IT WAS ALWAYS ABOUT INTIMACY.

06:11.772 --> 06:14.408
NOW I FEEL IF SOMEONE THROWS
THE WORD INTIMACY AT ME,

06:14.508 --> 06:16.777
I WANT TO PUNCH HER
IN THE MOUTH.

06:17.911 --> 06:21.014
- PUNCH "HER" IN THE MOUTH?
- WHAT?

06:21.114 --> 06:22.783
YOU SAID PUNCH "HER."

06:24.818 --> 06:25.853
OH.

06:25.953 --> 06:29.189
YOU KNOW, ALL THAT BULLSHIT
THAT I THOUGHT MEANT

06:29.289 --> 06:32.292
INTIMACY TO HER--
YOU KNOW, THE CANDLES,

06:32.392 --> 06:34.962
THE BACKRUBS, FEELING SAFE.

06:36.897 --> 06:39.066
MEANWHILE SHE'S
IN HER OWN PORNO FILM,

06:39.166 --> 06:42.102
FUCKING THIS--

06:42.202 --> 06:44.505
THIS GUY.

06:45.172 --> 06:46.907
NOW I-- I'M--

06:47.007 --> 06:50.210
I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
WHY SHE WOULD TELL YOU
GRAPHIC DETAILS.

06:50.310 --> 06:52.480
BECAUSE SHE WANTED
TO HURT ME.

06:52.580 --> 06:54.982
DID YOU ASK
FOR DETAILS?

06:55.082 --> 06:57.117
YEAH, I--

06:59.620 --> 07:02.523
I JUST WANTED TO--
I WANTED TO GET A GRASP

07:02.623 --> 07:04.792
OF THE SITUATION,
YOU KNOW?

07:04.892 --> 07:08.529
SHE MADE SURE YOU WOULDN'T
IGNORE WHAT SHE WAS SAYING.

07:10.964 --> 07:13.501
I THINK YOU KNEW
WHAT WAS GOING ON.

07:13.601 --> 07:17.004
LAST WEEK WHEN WE SPOKE,
I THINK YOU KNEW.

07:17.104 --> 07:20.140
I'M SURE KATE SENSED THAT
AS WELL-- YOUR SUSPICION.

07:20.240 --> 07:22.710
MAYBE I'M WRONG.

07:24.912 --> 07:27.247
I KNEW.

07:27.347 --> 07:29.182
I DID KNOW.

07:33.921 --> 07:36.456
YOU'D THINK THAT WOULD
MAKE IT EASIER, YOU KNOW?

07:36.557 --> 07:39.527
( chuckles )

07:39.627 --> 07:42.129
ALMOST THREW HER
OUT OF THE HOUSE.

07:42.229 --> 07:45.065
IT WAS LIKE, "YOU HURT ME?

07:45.165 --> 07:47.868
OKAY, I'M GONNA HURT YOU.

07:47.968 --> 07:50.437
NOW JUST GET THE FUCK
OUT OF HERE."

07:50.538 --> 07:52.806
I MEAN, THERE ARE
A THOUSAND WAYS

07:52.906 --> 07:55.275
THAT PEOPLE CAN DEAL
WITH THESE THINGS.

07:55.375 --> 07:56.944
WE COULD HAVE
GONE TO THERAPY,

07:57.044 --> 07:58.579
FOR EXAMPLE.

07:58.679 --> 08:02.015
I MEAN, NOT EVERYBODY HAS
TO FUCK AROUND.

08:02.115 --> 08:04.017
( clears throat )

08:04.117 --> 08:05.686
( sniffs )

08:08.355 --> 08:09.690
WHAT'S THAT?

08:11.625 --> 08:14.494
COLDEX NIGHT.

08:15.929 --> 08:18.331
WELL, THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
STRONGER THAN COLDEX DAY.

08:18.431 --> 08:20.133
I'VE...

08:20.233 --> 08:23.270
HAD TWO OF THEM ALREADY.
THEY KIND OF MAKE YOU
A BIT STONED.

08:23.370 --> 08:25.573
DO YOU WANT
SOME TEA, PAUL?

08:25.673 --> 08:28.776
- WATER WOULD BE GOOD, THANKS.
- SURE.

08:39.653 --> 08:42.222
I HAD A SESSION YESTERDAY
WITH THAT--

08:42.322 --> 08:43.657
THANKS.

08:46.760 --> 08:49.196
WITH THAT COUPLE
WHO CALLED ME A--

08:49.296 --> 08:51.765
WHO CALLED ME A MURDERER.

08:51.865 --> 08:54.534
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SESSION

08:54.635 --> 08:58.171
SHE RUNS TO THE BATHROOM
AND SHE STARTS TO BLEED.

08:58.271 --> 09:00.507
- WHAT HAPPENED?
- MISCARRIAGE.

09:00.608 --> 09:02.643
- OH MY GOD!
- MM-HMM, IT WAS PRETTY SCARY.

09:02.743 --> 09:04.912
- IS SHE ALL RIGHT?
- I THINK SHE'S FINE.

09:05.012 --> 09:07.748
I JUST SPOKE TO HER
AT THE HOSPITAL AND THEY'RE
RUNNING SOME TESTS,

09:07.848 --> 09:09.449
BUT SHE SEEMS TO BE OKAY.

09:09.549 --> 09:12.352
HUH, AT LEAST I'M NOT
A MURDERER.

09:12.452 --> 09:16.123
THOUGH I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED
IF THE HUSBAND BLAMED ME
FOR EVERYTHING.

09:16.223 --> 09:19.660
YOU KNOW, STRESS AS
A RESULT OF THERAPY.

09:20.728 --> 09:23.296
IT'S POSSIBLE.

09:24.464 --> 09:26.233
IRONICALLY,

09:26.333 --> 09:29.369
THEY'D BOTH JUST KIND
OF WORKED OUT THEIR PROBLEM.

09:29.469 --> 09:31.504
THEY WEREN'T ARGUING,

09:31.605 --> 09:34.107
WHICH FOR THEM IS
A MAJOR ACCOMPLISHMENT.

09:35.375 --> 09:39.379
AND HE SAID TO ME,
"THIS IS OUR LAST SESSION."

09:39.479 --> 09:41.181
AND THEN--

09:41.281 --> 09:43.617
THEN IT HAPPENED.

09:47.387 --> 09:50.557
ANYWAY, I WAS TRYING TO GET
THE BLOOD OUT OF THE COUCH,

09:50.658 --> 09:52.860
'CAUSE WHEN SHE GOT UP,
SHE LEFT A STAIN,

09:52.960 --> 09:55.362
AND-- AND-- AND KATE WALKS
INTO THE ROOM.

09:55.462 --> 09:58.031
AND SHE LOOKS AROUND
AND SHE SAYS...

09:59.399 --> 10:03.036
"WHAT GOES ON
IN THIS OFFICE?"

10:03.136 --> 10:05.205
( chuckles )

10:05.305 --> 10:07.708
( sighs )
ANYWAY...

10:09.476 --> 10:12.079
- QUITE A WEEK.
- YEAH.

10:12.179 --> 10:14.214
QUITE A WEEK.

10:14.314 --> 10:17.317
ULTIMATUMS
FROM TWO WOMEN.

10:17.417 --> 10:19.753
- HMM?
- KATE AND LAURA.

10:19.853 --> 10:22.322
- LAURA?
- SHE TELLS YOU
SHE'S IN LOVE WITH YOU.

10:22.422 --> 10:26.193
WHAT'S-- WHAT ARE YOU--
WHAT ARE WE GOING BACK
TO THAT FOR?

10:26.293 --> 10:29.296
I'VE JUST BEEN TALKING ABOUT
SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.

10:29.396 --> 10:30.698
YOU DON'T THINK
IT'S RELEVANT?

10:30.798 --> 10:32.599
YOU DESCRIBE TWO WOMEN
ATTACKING YOU.

10:32.700 --> 10:36.003
TWO WOMEN?
WHAT ABOUT THREE WOMEN?

10:37.170 --> 10:41.008
DOES IT FEEL LIKE
I'M ATTACKING?

10:41.108 --> 10:44.544
MAYBE THAT'S WHY YOU'RE
TAKING PILLS-- TO PROTECT
YOURSELF AGAINST ME.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.546
MMM, DID I MENTION
THAT I HAVE A COLD?

10:46.646 --> 10:49.349
LAST WEEK YOU CALLED ME
A SLEEPY SPIDER

10:49.449 --> 10:50.483
IN WAIT.

10:50.583 --> 10:53.253
( chuckles, coughs )

10:53.353 --> 10:55.255
WERE YOU, UH--

10:55.355 --> 10:57.124
WERE YOU INSULTED
BY THAT?

10:57.224 --> 11:00.160
- NO.
- OKAY.

11:00.260 --> 11:03.663
I TAKE IT BACK.
YOU'RE NOT SLEEPY.

11:03.764 --> 11:06.066
( laughs )

11:10.370 --> 11:13.273
WOULD YOU AGREE THAT YOUR
RELATIONSHIP WITH KATE HAS BEEN

11:13.373 --> 11:17.845
A WALL BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR
PATIENTS SO THAT YOU'RE SAFE?

11:17.945 --> 11:21.148
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE NOT
ATTRACTED TO THEM?

11:22.916 --> 11:25.819
ATTRACTION'S--
IT'S NOT A PROBLEM.

11:25.919 --> 11:28.789
NO?

11:28.889 --> 11:32.659
FREUD, MESSER,
DAVIES, ALL THE BIG GUYS,

11:32.760 --> 11:36.897
THEY ALL TALK ABOUT HOW
ATTRACTION IS INEVITABLE,
IT'S PART OF THERAPY.

11:36.997 --> 11:39.632
BUT IF YOU BRUSH IT
UNDER THE RUG,

11:39.733 --> 11:41.068
THE MESSAGE THAT YOU'RE
GIVING TO THE PATIENT

11:41.168 --> 11:44.337
IS THAT THEIR FEELINGS
ARE PERVERSE,
ARE DANGEROUS.

11:44.437 --> 11:47.207
THEIR FEELINGS?
I'M TALKING ABOUT
YOUR FEELINGS.

11:48.842 --> 11:52.445
I'M NOT WORRIED THAT LAURA
WILL TRY AND BREAK DOWN
THE WALL ON HER OWN.

11:52.545 --> 11:54.714
I'M WORRIED THAT YOU
WANT HER TO.

11:54.815 --> 11:56.784
THE-- THE WALL?

11:56.884 --> 12:00.487
( chuckles )
WHAT IS THIS METAPHOR?

12:01.822 --> 12:03.891
- MY WIFE IS A WALL?
- YOU DON'T AGREE?

12:03.991 --> 12:07.260
I'M NOT HIDING
FROM MY PATIENTS.

12:09.029 --> 12:10.931
THAT ESSAY THAT
BOLAS WROTE ABOUT--

12:11.031 --> 12:12.800
FORGET ABOUT BOLAS, PAUL.

12:12.900 --> 12:17.104
EVERY TIME WE GO DEEPER,
YOU REACH FOR SOME THEORY--

12:17.204 --> 12:21.274
THESE MALE THERAPISTS TORMENTED
BY LUST FOR THEIR PATIENTS.

12:21.374 --> 12:25.145
RIGHT?
I MENTION LAURA AND THAT'S
WHO YOU START QUOTING.

12:25.245 --> 12:27.647
BUT WHY ARE WE EVEN
TALKING ABOUT LAURA?

12:27.747 --> 12:30.050
BECAUSE I WANT YOU TO HEAR
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

12:30.150 --> 12:33.053
THAT YOU'RE SURROUNDED
BY WOMEN WHO DEMAND

12:33.153 --> 12:37.825
THAT YOU RESPOND AND LOVE
AND BE ANGRY AND FEEL,

12:37.925 --> 12:40.160
THAT YOU FACE YOUR FEELINGS.

12:44.364 --> 12:46.333
HMM.

12:50.770 --> 12:53.173
DID I MENTION
THAT LAURA IS--

12:54.107 --> 12:55.675
IS GETTING MARRIED
IN JUNE?

12:55.775 --> 12:58.145
NO.

13:01.081 --> 13:04.151
SO LAURA'S OVER.
THAT'S--

13:04.251 --> 13:06.486
THAT'S FINISHED.

13:10.490 --> 13:13.861
IF ANYONE WANTS TO PULL
DOWN A WALL, IT'S KATE.

13:15.128 --> 13:18.065
- WHY?
- SECRECY. SHE--

13:18.165 --> 13:21.501
SHE HATES IT.
SHE HATES THAT I CAN'T
SHARE IT.

13:21.601 --> 13:23.803
- YOU MEAN WORK?
- YEAH, SHE RESENTS MY OFFICE.

13:23.904 --> 13:25.438
IT'S LIKE ENEMY
TERRITORY TO HER.

13:25.538 --> 13:28.108
SHE'S ALWAYS TRYING
TO MAKE IT HER SPACE--

13:28.208 --> 13:31.711
A PIECE OF IT.
LIKE "LET'S GET
A NEW SOFA."

13:31.811 --> 13:34.414
- OR NEW BLINDS
OR A RUG OR SOMETHING.
- DO YOU LET HER?

13:34.514 --> 13:36.416
- NO, I DON'T.
- WHY NOT?

13:36.516 --> 13:40.453
BECAUSE I AGREE WITH HER.
IT'S NOT HER SPACE.

13:46.659 --> 13:51.031
I-- THERE WAS A TIME
WHEN I USED TO TALK
ABOUT MY PATIENTS,

13:51.131 --> 13:53.500
WHEN IAN WAS A KID.

13:53.600 --> 13:56.069
I WOULD SHARE--
SHARE DETAILS.

13:56.169 --> 13:58.305
WITH KATE.
YOU DON'T MEAN IAN.

13:58.405 --> 14:01.808
BOTH OF THEM
AT THE DINNER TABLE.

14:01.909 --> 14:05.845
OH, I SEE THAT
LOOK OF HORROR
ON YOUR FACE.

14:05.946 --> 14:07.747
NO, I WAS PRETTY
DISCREET ACTUALLY.

14:07.847 --> 14:10.750
I NEVER
MENTIONED ANY NAMES.
IF SOMEONE MENTIONED RATS,

14:10.850 --> 14:14.287
I'D SAY, "I HAD A PATIENT
WITH A FEAR OF RATS,

14:14.387 --> 14:16.789
DREAMED ABOUT
RATS EVERY NIGHT."

14:16.890 --> 14:18.191
YOU KNOW,
STUFF LIKE THAT.

14:18.291 --> 14:20.093
- YOU DON'T DO THAT NOW?
- NO.

14:20.193 --> 14:22.896
BUT I REMEMBER
WHEN IAN WAS ABOUT 10,

14:22.996 --> 14:25.832
HE ASKED ME, "DAD,
WHAT'S AN ALCOHOLIC?"

14:25.933 --> 14:28.701
AND I TOLD HIM ABOUT
THIS PATIENT OF MINE

14:28.801 --> 14:31.838
WHO NEEDED A DRINK
ACTUALLY TO GET OUT OF BED
IN THE MORNING.

14:31.939 --> 14:34.341
AND...

14:34.441 --> 14:37.244
ONE DAY THIS MAN CAME
UP TO THE OFFICE

14:37.344 --> 14:39.779
AND HE WAS
KIND OF STAGGERING

14:39.879 --> 14:42.549
AND IAN SAID, "DAD,
IS THAT THE ALCOHOLIC?"

14:44.952 --> 14:47.187
YOU WERE CARELESS.

14:47.287 --> 14:49.722
MM-HMM.

14:49.822 --> 14:53.893
THIS SITUATION NOW,
I THINK...

14:53.994 --> 14:57.130
THERE'S MORE AT STAKE.
DO YOU AGREE?

14:57.230 --> 14:59.532
WHY, BECAUSE WE'RE
TALKING ABOUT A WOMAN?

14:59.632 --> 15:01.501
SEXUAL ATTRACTION.

15:06.439 --> 15:08.008
( exhales )

15:08.108 --> 15:12.112
CAN I ASK YOU
A QUESTION?

15:12.212 --> 15:14.681
LET'S SAY YOU'RE
IN THE MIDDLE OF A SESSION
AND A PATIENT

15:14.781 --> 15:18.251
NEEDED TO USE THE BATHROOM
AND YOUR BATHROOM
IS BLOCKED UP.

15:18.351 --> 15:21.921
WOULD YOU LET THEM USE
THE BATHROOM IN YOUR HOUSE?

15:22.022 --> 15:23.290
DID THAT HAPPEN?

15:23.390 --> 15:25.993
YEAH, LAURA SAID
THAT SHE HAD TO PEE.

15:26.093 --> 15:28.962
AND I TOLD HER,
"WELL, THE TOILET'S
BLOCKED UP."

15:29.062 --> 15:32.365
AND, UH, SO SHE HEADED
FOR THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE

15:32.465 --> 15:36.203
AND I FREAKED OUT.
I JUMPED UP AND I
STOPPED HER.

15:36.303 --> 15:38.805
I'M KEEPING YOUR METAPHOR
GOING HERE.

15:38.905 --> 15:40.440
I HOPE YOU APPRECIATE
THAT ABOUT THE--

15:40.540 --> 15:43.410
- SHE TRIED TO SCALE THE WALL.
- MM-HMM.

15:43.510 --> 15:47.647
WELL, THERE'S ALWAYS
A PATIENT WHO WANTS
TO KNOW ABOUT YOU...

15:49.082 --> 15:52.219
MORE ABOUT
YOUR PRIVATE SELF.

15:53.586 --> 15:55.222
ANYWAY...

15:55.322 --> 15:57.190
UH...

15:57.290 --> 15:59.892
- WHAT DID YOU DO?
- I JUMPED UP. I PANICKED.

15:59.993 --> 16:03.496
- WHAT MADE YOU PANIC?
- SHE WAS DOING IT ON PURPOSE,
I FELT.

16:03.596 --> 16:08.101
I THOUGHT,
"WHY CAN'T SHE HOLD IT
FOR ANOTHER 10 MINUTES?"

16:13.906 --> 16:15.975
WHY DID I PANIC?

16:19.046 --> 16:21.414
I DON'T KNOW REALLY.

16:22.715 --> 16:25.652
HAS THAT EVER HAPPENED
WITH ANOTHER PATIENT?

16:25.752 --> 16:28.421
UH, SOPHIE,
THE GYMNAST--

16:28.521 --> 16:32.192
SHE CAME IN LAST WEEK
AND IT HAD BEEN RAINING

16:32.292 --> 16:34.527
AND SHE WAS
COMPLETELY SOAKED.

16:34.627 --> 16:37.530
SO I LET HER CHANGE
INTO MY DAUGHTER'S CLOTHES.

16:37.630 --> 16:41.368
- THAT DIDN'T MAKE
YOU UNCOMFORTABLE?
- UH, NO.

16:41.468 --> 16:45.705
IT'S A LOT MORE INTIMATE
THAN USING THE BATHROOM--
ROSIE'S CLOTHES.

16:45.805 --> 16:48.375
WELL, SHE--
( coughs )

16:48.475 --> 16:50.743
SHE HAD CASTS
ON BOTH HER ARMS

16:50.843 --> 16:52.612
FROM THE ACCIDENT.

16:52.712 --> 16:55.948
AND SHE HELD UP HER HANDS
LIKE THIS AND SHE SAID,

16:56.049 --> 16:58.885
"UNDRESS ME."

16:58.985 --> 17:00.920
SO I GOT KATE
TO COME IN AND HELP HER.

17:01.020 --> 17:03.723
- HOW OLD
DID YOU SAY SHE WAS?
- 16.

17:03.823 --> 17:06.393
AND THIS IS THE GIRL THAT'S
SLEEPING WITH HER ADULT COACH?

17:06.493 --> 17:08.528
WELL, SHE MIGHT BE
SLEEPING WITH HER COACH.

17:08.628 --> 17:11.298
IT'S A LOADED SITUATION,
HER ASKING YOU TO UNDRESS HER.

17:11.398 --> 17:13.533
- SHE WAS MESSING WITH ME.
- UH-HUH.

17:13.633 --> 17:16.503
- YOU HAD NO PROBLEM
HANDLING THAT?
- NO.

17:16.603 --> 17:19.939
YOU HAD KATE HELP HER,
UNDRESS HER, GIVE HER
YOUR DAUGHTER'S CLOTHES.

17:20.039 --> 17:22.075
BUT WHEN LAURA NEEDS
TO USE THE BATHROOM,

17:22.175 --> 17:24.177
YOU FREAK OUT.
WHY IS THAT?

17:24.277 --> 17:27.280
LAURA IS A WOMAN.
SOPHIE'S JUST A--
SHE'S JUST A CHILD.

17:27.380 --> 17:29.716
SHOULDN'T THAT
MAKE IT EASIER?

17:35.021 --> 17:37.390
HMM.

17:38.591 --> 17:41.194
YOU KNOW, THERE WAS--
THERE WAS A PART OF ME

17:41.294 --> 17:44.931
THAT REALLY WANTED LAURA
TO GO THROUGH THE DOOR,

17:45.031 --> 17:47.667
TO SEE WHERE I LIVE.

17:47.767 --> 17:50.670
MAYBE TO-- TO SEE KATE.

17:50.770 --> 17:52.272
YOU WANTED THAT?

17:53.240 --> 17:56.443
WAS THAT
WHAT SCARED YOU?

17:56.543 --> 17:59.179
DID YOU DISCUSS WHAT LAURA
TOLD YOU LAST WEEK?

18:00.780 --> 18:03.616
WELL, SHE SAID THAT
THE REASON THAT SHE WAS
GOING TO MARRY THIS GUY,

18:03.716 --> 18:05.452
THIS BOYFRIEND ANDREW,

18:05.552 --> 18:07.887
WAS BECAUSE I TOLD HER
I WASN'T INTERESTED.

18:07.987 --> 18:12.091
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING,
BUT I MADE IT REALLY CLEAR.

18:12.192 --> 18:16.196
I SAID NOTHING IS GOING
TO HAPPEN BETWEEN US.

18:16.296 --> 18:18.898
- GOOD.
- I'M-- I'M JUST--

18:18.998 --> 18:22.569
I'M NOT GOING TO PLAY ALONG.
THIS IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.

18:24.036 --> 18:26.439
IN YOUR MIND,
IS THERE ANY POSSIBILITY

18:26.539 --> 18:28.641
THAT THE AFFAIR COULD
BECOME A REALITY?

18:28.741 --> 18:30.810
( snorts )
GINA.

18:30.910 --> 18:32.545
NO, IN YOUR MIND.

18:32.645 --> 18:35.748
LOOK, I HAVE TO ADMIT
SOMETIMES IT'S-- IT'S--

18:35.848 --> 18:38.351
IT'S FLATTERING.
I-I--

18:38.451 --> 18:40.987
I CAN'T HELP BUT ENJOY
THE FEELING.

18:41.087 --> 18:43.790
BUT I TOLD HER NO.

18:43.890 --> 18:46.293
I SAID, "THIS CANNOT HAPPEN.

18:46.393 --> 18:49.462
YOU CANNOT
GO THROUGH THAT DOOR.
THERE ARE LIMITS."

18:49.562 --> 18:53.065
IS THAT WHAT UPSET YOU,
THAT SHE WAS TESTING YOU?

18:53.166 --> 18:54.734
GINA, IT'S NOT THAT ABSTRACT.

18:54.834 --> 18:57.136
SHE'S--

18:57.237 --> 18:59.872
SHE'S A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.

18:59.972 --> 19:03.710
SHE SAYS SHE WANTS
TO HAVE SEX WITH ME.

19:03.810 --> 19:06.946
I KNOW WHAT'S IN HER HEAD,

19:07.046 --> 19:10.283
SO I DON'T WANT HER GOING
THROUGH THE DOOR AND MAYBE
BUMPING INTO KATE.

19:10.383 --> 19:13.186
BUT YOU SAID
YOU DID WANT THAT.

19:13.286 --> 19:15.555
SOME PART OF YOU
WANTED THAT.

19:15.655 --> 19:16.656
NO, I-- I--

19:16.756 --> 19:18.691
NO.

19:20.393 --> 19:22.462
THE POINT I'M MAKING IS THAT
I WANT LAURA

19:22.562 --> 19:24.564
TO UNDERSTAND THAT
WE CAN SURVIVE THIS,

19:24.664 --> 19:27.700
THAT ANY ATTRACTION
THAT COMES UP BETWEEN US
I CAN HANDLE.

19:27.800 --> 19:30.503
I AM NOT GOING TO LET THIS
DERAIL THE THERAPY.

19:30.603 --> 19:32.772
- HER WANTING
TO SLEEP WITH YOU?
- YEAH.

19:32.872 --> 19:34.307
HOW DID SHE PUT IT EXACTLY?

19:34.407 --> 19:37.109
OH, THAT SHE KNOWS THAT...

19:37.210 --> 19:39.612
I WANT HER.

19:40.447 --> 19:43.316
SHE SAID THAT SHE WANTS...

19:43.416 --> 19:45.652
( clears throat )
TO FUCK ME AND THAT

19:45.752 --> 19:48.821
SHE KNOWS THAT I WANT
TO FUCK HER TOO.

19:50.223 --> 19:52.191
THAT'S A LOT TO STAVE OFF,

19:52.292 --> 19:54.427
THAT KIND OF INTENSITY.

19:54.527 --> 19:56.963
SHE CAN BE
VERY DIRECT-- LAURA.

19:57.063 --> 19:59.566
MAYBE THAT'S WHY I PANICKED.

20:04.604 --> 20:06.506
HERE'S WHAT
I THINK, PAUL,

20:06.606 --> 20:10.277
AND YOU CAN
ACCEPT THIS OR TELL ME
I'M INTERFERING AGAIN.

20:12.279 --> 20:14.381
BUT GIVEN THE SITUATION
WITH KATE,

20:14.481 --> 20:18.718
I THINK WE--
WE MIGHT EXPLORE
THE OPTION

20:18.818 --> 20:21.554
OF TRANSFERRING LAURA
TO ANOTHER THERAPIST.

20:21.654 --> 20:24.791
- WHAT?
- JUST HEAR ME OUT
ON THIS, PAUL.

20:24.891 --> 20:27.427
BECAUSE LAURA THINKS
SHE WANTS TO SLEEP WITH ME?

20:27.527 --> 20:30.997
LAST WEEK YOU THOUGHT
WE WERE ALREADY HAVING SEX.

20:31.097 --> 20:34.166
I THOUGHT AN AFFAIR
HAD BEGUN AND YOU WERE
TRYING TO JUSTIFY IT.

20:34.267 --> 20:36.235
- OH, THANKS, GINA.
- I WAS WRONG.

20:36.336 --> 20:38.871
I'M SORRY.
I JUMPED TO CONCLUSIONS.

20:38.971 --> 20:41.541
YOU'VE REASSURED ME.

20:41.641 --> 20:43.843
BUT NOW THIS SITUATION
WITH KATE--

20:43.943 --> 20:47.179
HOW EMOTIONAL YOU ARE
AND THE PRESSURE
YOU'RE UNDER.

20:47.280 --> 20:50.149
LISTEN TO YOURSELF.
YOU'RE INJURED.

20:50.249 --> 20:53.620
YOU'RE VULNERABLE.
YOU'RE ANGRY.

20:53.720 --> 20:55.655
THIS ISN'T ME BEING
STUBBORN, PAUL.

20:55.755 --> 20:58.425
I THINK WE SHOULD JUST
DISCUSS THE POSSIBILITY

20:58.525 --> 21:01.694
THAT LAURA'S BETTER OFF
WITH A DIFFERENT THERAPIST.

21:01.794 --> 21:04.564
- A FEMALE THERAPIST, YOU MEAN.
- YEAH, PREFERABLY.

21:04.664 --> 21:07.600
- YOU, FOR INSTANCE?
- NO, I'M RETIRED, REMEMBER?

21:07.700 --> 21:09.636
THIS IS SO TYPICAL
OF YOU, GINA.

21:09.736 --> 21:14.173
YOU ALWAYS BEGIN BY SAYING
"I HATE TO SAY THIS, BUT--"

21:14.273 --> 21:17.677
"BUT" AND THEN YOU LAY
SOME PRONOUNCEMENT ON ME

21:17.777 --> 21:21.113
THAT YOU'VE ALREADY BEEN
THINKING ABOUT BEFORE YOU'VE
COME INTO THE SESSION.

21:21.213 --> 21:22.949
THIS ISN'T A DEBATE CLUB,
YOU KNOW?

21:23.049 --> 21:26.118
IT'S NOT LIKE WE TAKE
A POSITION AND WE HUNT
FOR WAYS TO SUPPORT IT.

21:26.218 --> 21:27.654
THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M DOING.

21:27.754 --> 21:29.689
I'M LISTENING.

21:29.789 --> 21:33.292
YOU HAVE KATE ON ONE SIDE
AND YOU HAVE LAURA ON THE OTHER.

21:33.393 --> 21:35.995
BUT THEY'RE TWO TOTALLY
DIFFERENT SITUATIONS, GINA.

21:41.901 --> 21:45.338
ARE-- ARE YOU SAYING
THAT I PUSHED KATE INTO
THIS SITUATION?

21:45.438 --> 21:48.341
THAT I CREATED
THIS ENVIRONMENT AT HOME

21:48.441 --> 21:52.178
SO THAT KATE COULD GO
FUCK AN INSURANCE AGENT

21:52.278 --> 21:54.781
BECAUSE REALLY I'M
IN LOVE WITH LAURA?

21:54.881 --> 21:57.717
ISN'T THAT YOUR THEORY?
YOUR NOTES SOMEWHERE?

21:57.817 --> 22:00.620
- LOOK AT HOW YOU'RE REACTING.
- HOW AM I REACTING?

22:04.491 --> 22:07.894
I AM NOT SENDING LAURA
TO ANOTHER THERAPIST.

22:07.994 --> 22:10.229
END OF STORY.

22:10.329 --> 22:12.298
I CAN HANDLE WHATEVER
COMES UP IN THE SESSIONS.

22:12.399 --> 22:15.502
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE--
BECAUSE I WANT YOU TO HELP ME
TO HANDLE IT.

22:15.602 --> 22:18.671
WE JUST NEED
TO DISCUSS THIS, PAUL.

22:18.771 --> 22:20.940
I DON'T WANT TO PAWN HER OFF
ON SOMEBODY ELSE.

22:21.040 --> 22:23.576
WE NEED TO EXAMINE
WHAT'S BEST FOR LAURA.

22:23.676 --> 22:26.446
HONESTLY, IF IT WASN'T
FOR KATE CHEATING...

22:28.147 --> 22:30.450
I WOULDN'T BE HERE, GINA.

22:34.754 --> 22:37.690
AND WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT
YOUR COMMENT THE LAST TIME.

22:37.790 --> 22:40.593
I WAS STILL PRETTY
PISSED OFF ABOUT THAT.

22:40.693 --> 22:43.496
- ABOUT WHAT?
- YOU MADE A CRACK
ABOUT MY FATHER

22:43.596 --> 22:46.165
LEAVING MY MOTHER
FOR A PATIENT.

22:46.265 --> 22:48.935
WHAT WAS THAT SUPPOSED
TO MEAN?

22:49.035 --> 22:52.605
THAT I CAN'T TREAT
LAURA BECAUSE OF WHAT
MY FATHER DID YEARS AGO?

22:52.705 --> 22:54.373
I'M NOT MY FATHER,
FOR CHRIST'S SAKE.

22:54.474 --> 22:56.008
NO, YOU'RE NOT YOUR FATHER.

22:56.108 --> 22:59.679
I'M SUGGESTING A PATTERN THAT
MIGHT BE THREATENING TO YOU.

22:59.779 --> 23:02.181
ARE YOU
OR ARE YOU NOT, GINA,

23:02.281 --> 23:04.350
SAYING THAT BECAUSE
OF MY FATHER,

23:04.451 --> 23:06.419
THAT I'M IN DANGER
OF HAVING AN AFFAIR?

23:08.955 --> 23:12.091
MY-- MY GUT--

23:14.293 --> 23:16.696
YOU CAN'T ANSWER IT,
CAN YOU?

23:19.065 --> 23:21.000
NO, I CAN'T.

23:27.106 --> 23:31.043
IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY,
YOU WERE FACED WITH THE SAME
SCENARIO YOURSELF.

23:31.143 --> 23:34.046
SO MAYBE THIS REALLY
ISN'T ABOUT MY FATHER.

23:34.146 --> 23:36.082
MAYBE IT'S ABOUT YOU, GINA.

23:36.182 --> 23:39.586
DON'T FORGET I WAS THE ONE
WHO REFERRED CHARLIE TO YOU.

23:40.953 --> 23:43.590
I REMEMBER HE CALLED ME
AFTER ONE OF YOUR SESSIONS.

23:43.690 --> 23:46.559
AND HE CONFESSED TO ME THAT--

23:46.659 --> 23:49.228
THAT HE WAS IN LOVE WITH YOU.

23:49.328 --> 23:51.564
NO, ACTUALLY HE WENT FURTHER.

23:51.664 --> 23:53.833
HE SAID THAT YOU WERE
IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER.

23:55.568 --> 23:57.704
MAYBE HE WAS WRONG,
I DON'T KNOW.

23:57.804 --> 24:01.240
EITHER WAY, YOU NEEDED
TO FACE THAT, AND YOU DIDN'T.

24:01.340 --> 24:03.876
YOU JUST RAN OFF TO ENGLAND.

24:03.976 --> 24:07.680
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I COULD NOT BELIEVE
WHEN THAT HAPPENED.

24:09.649 --> 24:11.784
THAT WAS A WAKE-UP CALL
FOR ME,

24:11.884 --> 24:14.386
WATCHING YOU
BEHAVE LIKE THAT.

24:14.487 --> 24:17.256
I DIDN'T RUN AWAY.

24:17.356 --> 24:19.926
COME ON, A SABBATICAL
WITH DAVID?

24:20.026 --> 24:22.929
AT THAT MOMENT?

24:25.131 --> 24:27.500
( snorts )

24:29.502 --> 24:31.904
BY THE WAY, IS THAT WHAT
YOUR NOVEL IS ABOUT?

24:33.873 --> 24:35.307
I FIGURED.

24:35.407 --> 24:38.277
YOU FAILED THE SAME TEST
YOURSELF, GINA,

24:38.377 --> 24:40.580
BUT YOU ABANDONED
A PATIENT.

24:42.782 --> 24:45.552
HE TRIED TO GET HOLD OF YOU
OVER THE YEARS, DIDN'T HE?

24:47.486 --> 24:49.956
A FEW LETTERS.
( clears throat )

24:50.056 --> 24:53.192
I DIDN'T ANSWER.
( clears throat )

24:54.527 --> 24:56.729
YOU DO KNOW THAT HE DIED
A FEW MONTHS AGO?

24:59.365 --> 25:03.202
( snorts )
PROSTATE CANCER, HMM.

25:05.538 --> 25:09.041
IT WAS RIGHT AFTER
DAVID AND I COULDN'T GO
TO ANOTHER FUNERAL.

25:09.141 --> 25:11.711
I JUST COULDN'T--
I COULDN'T FACE IT.

25:17.950 --> 25:20.186
IT'S FUNNY, YOU KNOW?
I WAS TALKING

25:20.286 --> 25:22.589
ABOUT CHARLIE
THE OTHER DAY

25:22.689 --> 25:25.758
TO A PATIENT OF MINE.
I WAS SAYING THAT I--

25:25.858 --> 25:28.661
I'D BEEN TO HIS FUNERAL
AND THAT I WAS--

25:28.761 --> 25:31.964
I COULDN'T FEEL SADNESS.

25:33.800 --> 25:36.869
( sighs )
AND I WAS, YOU KNOW,
BEATING MYSELF UP ABOUT IT.

25:41.340 --> 25:43.475
THE TRUTH IS, I WAS--

25:43.576 --> 25:46.713
I WAS SO DISILLUSIONED
WITH YOU, GINA,

25:46.813 --> 25:49.649
FOR KEEPING YOU ON
AS A SUPERVISOR.

25:49.749 --> 25:52.318
AFTER WHAT YOU PULLED,
WHAT YOU DID WITH CHARLIE,

25:52.418 --> 25:55.221
I SHOULD HAVE JUST
WALKED OUT THEN.

25:56.589 --> 25:59.726
YOU KNOW THAT HE NEVER
EVER GOT OVER YOU?

26:10.737 --> 26:13.906
SINCE WE'RE DIGGING
FOR THE TRUTH...

26:18.611 --> 26:21.513
MAY I ASK HOW YOU
REALLY FEEL ABOUT LAURA?

26:21.614 --> 26:23.816
I HAVEN'T HEARD
A CLEAR ANSWER.

26:23.916 --> 26:27.453
NOT WHAT YOU'RE GOING
TO DO ABOUT HER,
BUT HOW YOU FEEL.

26:27.553 --> 26:31.190
DO YOU MEAN, AM I
ATTRACTED TO HER?

26:31.290 --> 26:32.925
- ARE YOU?
- COME ON, GINA.

26:33.025 --> 26:35.561
IF I TRANSFERRED EVERY PATIENT
I WAS ATTRACTED TO AT SOME POINT

26:35.662 --> 26:37.363
I WOULDN'T HAVE
ANY PATIENTS LEFT.

26:40.032 --> 26:43.770
AND IT'S NOT YOUR PLACE TO SAY
I SHOULD TRANSFER A PATIENT.

26:43.870 --> 26:46.806
IT'S LIKE ME TELLING
THAT COUPLE THEY SHOULD
HAVE AN ABORTION.

26:46.906 --> 26:48.875
IT'S NOT WHAT THERAPISTS DO.

26:48.975 --> 26:52.812
WE DON'T TELL PEOPLE
HOW TO RUN THEIR LIVES.

26:53.846 --> 26:56.949
I'M SUGGESTING
THAT WE TALK ABOUT

26:57.049 --> 26:59.919
STOPPING LAURA'S THERAPY
AND LOOK AT YOUR REACTION.

27:02.655 --> 27:05.091
PAUL, DO YOU REALLY
NEED ANOTHER PILL?

27:05.191 --> 27:09.461
I KNOW.
TOMORROW'S SATURDAY.
I CAN SLEEP ALL DAY SUNDAY.

27:09.561 --> 27:13.032
I DON'T REALLY CARE IF THEY
KNOCK ME OUT OR NOT, REALLY.

27:17.269 --> 27:20.773
WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH
WITH KATE IS SO COMPLICATED.

27:27.646 --> 27:30.416
YEAH.

27:36.088 --> 27:37.323
( exhales )

27:45.597 --> 27:49.235
( theme music playing )
