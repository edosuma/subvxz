01:15.500 --> 01:17.500

01:41.500 --> 01:43.500
<i>* All my niggas put in work *</i>

01:45.500 --> 01:46.500
Housekeeping!

01:48.500 --> 01:50.500
Arm yourselves, gentlemen.

01:58.500 --> 02:01.500
Okay, this is the last time
I'm gonna say it, and then I'll drop it.

02:01.500 --> 02:04.500
But what about my jeans club idea?

02:04.500 --> 02:06.500
Right? Twenty dollars a month

02:06.500 --> 02:09.500
for access to over 10,500 pairs of jeans?

02:09.500 --> 02:10.500
Who wouldn't buy that?

02:10.500 --> 02:12.500
Well, almost everybody we asked about it.
Right?

02:12.500 --> 02:14.500
What about my hot-tutor idea?

02:15.500 --> 02:18.500
Kids would study harder
if their tutor was really hot, right?

02:18.500 --> 02:20.500
We just needed to build up
our, our stable of tutoresses.

02:20.500 --> 02:23.500
Yeah, well, maybe when you called them
a "stable of tutoresses"

02:23.500 --> 02:26.500
on the Craigslisting...
that was a bad idea.

02:26.500 --> 02:28.500
We could come up with other names.

02:28.500 --> 02:30.500
The whole point
is that it's a weird concept

02:30.500 --> 02:33.500
to hire women
to take off their clothes for children.

02:34.500 --> 02:37.500
Why am I coming up with the ideas, right?
I'm not the idea guy.

02:37.500 --> 02:40.500
Darren, that's you. You're the idea guy.

02:40.500 --> 02:41.500
I'm the "why." You're the "what."

02:41.500 --> 02:43.500
Baby Dunc, you're the "how."

02:43.500 --> 02:45.500
So let's put it
into high gear right now, baby.

02:46.500 --> 02:47.500
Why? Because our lives suck.

02:48.500 --> 02:51.500
I did my part.
What are we gonna do about it, Darren?

02:51.500 --> 02:52.500
And how are we gonna do it, Baby Dunc?

02:52.500 --> 02:54.500
Let's go! Let's freakin'...

02:54.500 --> 02:57.500
...put it into high gear.

02:58.500 --> 03:00.500
Yeah, let's kick it into high gear.
Sell me some salvia.

03:00.500 --> 03:02.500
- I'm about to get high.
- Darren.

03:02.500 --> 03:05.500
Darren, you're a drug addict.
And I'm here to help.

03:05.500 --> 03:07.500
- I got you. There you go.
- Thank you, baby.

03:08.500 --> 03:09.500
Enjoy that.

03:09.500 --> 03:10.500
- Ooh.
- What the hell are you doing, man?

03:11.500 --> 03:12.500
I'm a hustler. "I'm a, I'm a hustler."

03:12.500 --> 03:15.500
I'm basically the Rick Ross
of our friendship tripod.

03:15.500 --> 03:16.500
What's the big deal?

03:16.500 --> 03:18.500
Weed does not do the trick anymore.

03:18.500 --> 03:20.500
- This stuff does.
- Really great.

03:20.500 --> 03:22.500
I'm not gonna become the mom
from Moonlight.

03:22.500 --> 03:25.500
Yeah, no.
I know what that movie's about.

03:25.500 --> 03:26.500
I steered clear of that one.

03:27.500 --> 03:29.500
I'm more of a La La Land guy.

03:29.500 --> 03:30.500
La-la boy.

03:34.500 --> 03:36.500
Bye-bye.

03:37.500 --> 03:38.500
Latro.

03:41.500 --> 03:42.500
- Gonna start tweakin'.
- Yeah.

03:43.500 --> 03:45.500
He's gonna start tweakin'!

03:45.500 --> 03:48.500
My God.
Look at the size of this dude's load!

03:48.500 --> 03:50.500
- What?
- Look at this thing!

03:50.500 --> 03:52.500
Don't touch it.

03:52.500 --> 03:53.500
That's a heavy hitter.

03:53.500 --> 03:55.500
Whoa. Yeah, no.

03:55.500 --> 03:56.500
It's like Nickelodeon Gak.

03:59.500 --> 04:01.500
- The consistency's thick, like flubber.
- Mm.

04:01.500 --> 04:03.500
Rub some on our shoes,
see if we can play basketball.

04:03.500 --> 04:06.500
I mean, his nut sack must be gigantoid.

04:06.500 --> 04:08.500
- Yeah.
- Right? Just big old sack

04:08.500 --> 04:10.500
- to produce that.
- I don't really wanna imagine

04:10.500 --> 04:12.500
any nut sacks,

04:12.500 --> 04:15.500
but I will say the only thing
that would make me blow a load that big

04:15.500 --> 04:18.500
is a really hot babe, right? I am right?

04:18.500 --> 04:21.500
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

04:21.500 --> 04:23.500
I mean, look. They're everywhere, man.

04:23.500 --> 04:25.500
There's one. There's one.

04:25.500 --> 04:26.500
This guy's busting loads
all over this room.

04:27.500 --> 04:28.500
That's what we should be doing.

04:28.500 --> 04:30.500
We should be busting loads into condoms

04:30.500 --> 04:32.500
or maybe even not into condoms
if she's tested.

04:34.500 --> 04:37.500
He's chuggin' champagne
like a freakin' boss!

04:37.500 --> 04:40.500
I'm over here, I'm holding on
to the poop side of this scrubber.

04:40.500 --> 04:42.500
Sure, yes. I've heard all of this before.

04:42.500 --> 04:46.500
We should be wearing diamonds,
collecting albino pythons, dating on Raya.

04:46.500 --> 04:47.500
Raya?

04:47.500 --> 04:49.500
We're not, okay? We're here.

04:49.500 --> 04:51.500
This is our life.

04:52.500 --> 04:54.500
That's still fizzy.
It's pretty good. You might want some.

04:55.500 --> 04:56.500
- What was that?
- he's tweaking.

04:56.500 --> 04:59.500
Here, here. Grab a condom.
Put it on his face. I'll take a picture.

04:59.500 --> 05:02.500
you are a dog.

05:02.500 --> 05:06.500
- That's what he gets.
- My God.

05:06.500 --> 05:08.500
We got the snakeskin.

05:08.500 --> 05:10.500
- Don't do drugs.
- No!

05:10.500 --> 05:12.500
- Okay.
- No!

05:12.500 --> 05:14.500
- Put it on his face.
- Take the photo.

05:14.500 --> 05:16.500
- Take the picture. Take a photo.
- No.

05:16.500 --> 05:18.500
I will as soon as you put it on his face.

05:18.500 --> 05:20.500
- I'm not going to. Just take the photo.
- Just put it on his face.

05:20.500 --> 05:23.500
- He'll get an STD.
- All the ejac is inside of the condom.

05:23.500 --> 05:25.500
Take the photo.

05:25.500 --> 05:26.500
Grab it!

05:26.500 --> 05:29.500
The outside, the woman she could have one, obviously.

05:29.500 --> 05:31.500
Well, she...

05:33.500 --> 05:35.500
What's wrong with him?

05:35.500 --> 05:36.500
- Yep. Darren!
- No!

05:36.500 --> 05:38.500
- All right, just stop.
- Darren.

05:38.500 --> 05:39.500
Okay. Joel, I got this. Come on.

05:39.500 --> 05:41.500
You want some salvia? Huh?

05:42.500 --> 05:43.500
Get the fuck out of my room.

05:43.500 --> 05:45.500
Get out, maids.

05:45.500 --> 05:47.500
We're not maids. We're housekeepers.

05:47.500 --> 05:50.500
- Not even that hot.
- Yeah, dude, you're not even that hot.

05:50.500 --> 05:52.500
I was talking about the chick, Baby Dunc.

05:52.500 --> 05:54.500
Yeah, so was I.

05:54.500 --> 05:56.500
It's 2018. You can call chicks dudes now.

05:56.500 --> 05:58.500
- Okay.
- You can.

05:58.500 --> 05:59.500
What the heck are you guys doing?

06:00.500 --> 06:03.500
dude. See?

06:05.500 --> 06:07.500
Is he high again?

06:08.500 --> 06:09.500
No.

06:10.500 --> 06:12.500
I don't think he's being truthful.
I have to call Mitch.

06:12.500 --> 06:14.500
Wish you wouldn't.

06:14.500 --> 06:16.500
- Don't do that!
- Hi, Mitch.

06:16.500 --> 06:18.500
- It's Cassie.
- Don't do that to your boy.

06:19.500 --> 06:20.500
- Jesus Christ.
- What?

06:20.500 --> 06:22.500
Pick him up. Put him on the cart.

06:22.500 --> 06:25.500
Come on, Darren.
Come on, come on.

06:25.500 --> 06:26.500
Jesus.

06:26.500 --> 06:29.500
<i>* Dollar-dollar bill, y'all
Cash rules everything around me *</i>

06:29.500 --> 06:30.500
<i>* C.R.E.A.M., get the money *</i>

06:30.500 --> 06:32.500
<i>* Dollar-dollar bill, y'all *</i>

06:35.500 --> 06:37.500
So they were yelling at hotel guests
and smoking dope.

06:37.500 --> 06:39.500
- Is that right?
- Yes.

06:39.500 --> 06:41.500
Yelling at guests, screaming obscenities.

06:41.500 --> 06:44.500
Well, Tums, boys will be boys.

06:44.500 --> 06:47.500
You still want that associate manager
promotion, don't you?

06:47.500 --> 06:50.500
Well, honey,
tonight is your chance to prove it.

06:50.500 --> 06:51.500
All right?

06:51.500 --> 06:54.500
Hope you got your balls on, now.

06:55.500 --> 06:57.500
No, I have...

06:57.500 --> 07:01.500
uh, yes, I have giant
lady, lady parts

07:01.500 --> 07:02.500
that hang like balls.

07:02.500 --> 07:05.500
They're also called ovaries.
Those are inside.

07:05.500 --> 07:08.500
Good, 'cause we have got a shit storm
of a party heading our way tonight.

07:08.500 --> 07:10.500
Boys, I'm gonna need you working too.

07:10.500 --> 07:12.500
Toni, what? Are you serious?

07:12.500 --> 07:15.500
Corky! This is Mr. Ahmad.

07:15.500 --> 07:18.500
He is the personal attach?Š
of the Bey of Tunisia.

07:19.500 --> 07:21.500
like the butler from Fresh Prince?

07:21.500 --> 07:22.500
Very neat.

07:22.500 --> 07:25.500
- I'm far from a butler.
- Wonder what happened to that guy.

07:25.500 --> 07:27.500
that dude's paid.
He's doing fine.

07:27.500 --> 07:29.500
Bey Awadi. The rich dude from Instagram?

07:29.500 --> 07:30.500
This is who we speak of.

07:30.500 --> 07:32.500
Aw, I love that dude.

07:32.500 --> 07:34.500
He takes all the pictures
with the hot models

07:34.500 --> 07:35.500
and the guns and the hovercrafts,

07:35.500 --> 07:37.500
and the hot models shooting guns
on hovercrafts.

07:37.500 --> 07:40.500
Yeah, didn't he poop off the Eiffel Tower?

07:40.500 --> 07:41.500
- Mm-mm, no.
- Yeah.

07:41.500 --> 07:44.500
He paid a man $10,500
to poop off the Eiffel Tower.

07:45.500 --> 07:46.500
That's what's up.

07:46.500 --> 07:48.500
He pays dudes tons of money all the time

07:48.500 --> 07:50.500
- to do, like, stupid shit.
- Wow.

07:51.500 --> 07:52.500
- Dudes.
- What?

07:52.500 --> 07:53.500
We should pitch him the...

07:55.500 --> 07:58.500
We should, pitch in tonight.

07:58.500 --> 08:00.500
At the party. And be a team player.

08:00.500 --> 08:04.500
Also, I should mention no cameras.
That includes cell phones.

08:04.500 --> 08:08.500
- Privacy, a great concern of the Bey.
- All right, copy that. Give them up, boys.

08:08.500 --> 08:09.500
- What, now?
- Yeah.

08:09.500 --> 08:13.500
Hashtag "right now." What is it
with you kids and the phones? Come on.

08:13.500 --> 08:15.500
You'll get 'em back
at the end of the night.

08:17.500 --> 08:19.500
Okay. Now...

08:19.500 --> 08:22.500
you guys have some place to be?
I bet you do, huh?

08:23.500 --> 08:24.500
So fucking get there!

08:26.500 --> 08:28.500
hey!

08:28.500 --> 08:30.500
Sack up now, Tums. Big night, right?

08:30.500 --> 08:31.500
Yes!

08:32.500 --> 08:34.500
I can't get in there.

08:34.500 --> 08:37.500
I call her Tums
'cause she relieves my heartburn.

08:37.500 --> 08:39.500
Always been a nickname guy,

08:39.500 --> 08:42.500
even when I was back QB-ing at USC.

08:42.500 --> 08:44.500
Our security team should be arriving soon.

08:44.500 --> 08:45.500
Great.

08:45.500 --> 08:47.500
wanna go for one?

08:47.500 --> 08:48.500
- No.
- Blue.

08:48.500 --> 08:51.500
- Forty-two! Hut, hut, hut, huh?
- What are we doing?

08:51.500 --> 08:52.500
- Wanna go?
- I don't know what...

08:52.500 --> 08:54.500
All right. Fuck it.

08:56.500 --> 08:57.500
Right in the numbers!

08:57.500 --> 08:58.500
I still got it.

08:58.500 --> 09:00.500
I'll race you down there. Come on!

09:08.500 --> 09:09.500
<i>Don't be stingy, papi.</i>

09:12.500 --> 09:16.500
- Kisses.
- You like that?

09:16.500 --> 09:18.500
It's for you.

09:20.500 --> 09:23.500
- Uh, I have to go.
<i>- Okay, bye. Bye, sexy.</i>

09:29.500 --> 09:31.500
I'm Ray.

09:32.500 --> 09:36.500
Mitch usually has me run security
for these special events.

09:36.500 --> 09:39.500
Uh, but you look like
you know what you're doing.

09:39.500 --> 09:42.500
I'm just here
for the payday, right?

09:42.500 --> 09:43.500
That makes two of us.

09:44.500 --> 09:45.500
Aah!

09:47.000 --> 09:53.074

09:59.500 --> 10:02.500
Donald, get linked up
with our offshore bank accounts

10:02.500 --> 10:03.500
as soon as possible.

10:03.500 --> 10:04.500
Well, you didn't bring me along

10:04.500 --> 10:07.500
'cause I look like the black nerd
from Die Hard...

10:07.500 --> 10:08.500
'cause I don't.

10:08.500 --> 10:11.500
Roger, I'm sick of it.

10:11.500 --> 10:13.500
We need to secure the building
and arm the exits

10:13.500 --> 10:17.500
with our explosive triggers
before we can take control of the rooftop.

10:17.500 --> 10:21.500
So until then,
consider yourselves "hotel security."

10:22.500 --> 10:25.500
And once the Bey gives us
his account access codes

10:25.500 --> 10:27.500
and Donald transfers the money...

10:27.500 --> 10:29.500
we pull out.

10:30.500 --> 10:32.500
Gentlemen, let's move.

10:32.500 --> 10:36.500
and, someone get rid of the body.

10:39.500 --> 10:41.500
You should grab his ankles.
You're good at that.

10:42.500 --> 10:45.500
- Fuck off, fag.
- Ooh.

10:52.500 --> 10:56.500
You'd seriously wanna pitch
the Bey of Tunisia

10:56.500 --> 10:57.500
one of our million-dollar ideas?

10:57.500 --> 10:59.500
- Yeah.
- If we're pitching an idea...

10:59.500 --> 11:02.500
- We're pitching!
- What are we pitching?

11:02.500 --> 11:05.500
We could go
with my jeans club idea.

11:05.500 --> 11:06.500
Hot tutors.

11:06.500 --> 11:09.500
Medieval Times:
breakfast, lunch, and tournament?

11:09.500 --> 11:12.500
I don't ever wanna hear
about Medieval Times BLT ever again.

11:12.500 --> 11:14.500
Okay, they only do dinner.

11:14.500 --> 11:16.500
We would do breakfast and lunch.
That's two more meals!

11:17.500 --> 11:20.500
We would totally knock 'em out
of the medieval dining space.

11:20.500 --> 11:21.500
that's a huge market.

11:21.500 --> 11:24.500
Okay, you guys have good ideas?
I wanna hear 'em. I'm excited to hear 'em.

11:24.500 --> 11:26.500
I feel like I'm the only one

11:26.500 --> 11:28.500
crushing ideas out the gate.

11:29.500 --> 11:31.500
Skintendo Joysuit?

11:31.500 --> 11:33.500
Uh, what? No. Baby Dunc...

11:34.500 --> 11:36.500
Yeah, we're going Skintendo. I like it.

11:36.500 --> 11:39.500
All right, you know what?
I hate to be this guy,

11:39.500 --> 11:41.500
but that dude's not gonna invest
in Skintendo.

11:41.500 --> 11:43.500
Not in a million Willenniums.

11:43.500 --> 11:46.500
So, it's like that?

11:47.500 --> 11:50.500
We finally have a shot

11:50.500 --> 11:53.500
to fulfill our childhood dreams

11:54.500 --> 11:57.500
and you guys wanna let it float on past?

11:58.500 --> 12:00.500
It's, like, dat?

12:04.500 --> 12:05.500
I don't know about you,

12:05.500 --> 12:07.500
but I don't wanna be picking up
nut-stuffed condoms

12:08.500 --> 12:11.500
for the rest of my life without knowing
what type of sex they had with it.

12:11.500 --> 12:13.500
Was it missionary? Was it doggy?

12:13.500 --> 12:15.500
Was it doggy butt? Was it side-style butt?
I don't know.

12:15.500 --> 12:20.500
Yeah, Alexxx, we all wanna know
how people are fucking each other, okay?

12:20.500 --> 12:22.500
- Obviously.
- It's obvious.

12:22.500 --> 12:24.500
- Mostly all I think about.
- Yeah, I mean, I can keep going.

12:24.500 --> 12:26.500
- Cowgirl, reverse cowgirl.
- Plow-girl.

12:26.500 --> 12:28.500
- Where you take the legs and you...
- Yeah.

12:28.500 --> 12:30.500
I'm just saying,
we don't have the Joysuit.

12:30.500 --> 12:33.500
Right? There's no screen
to play Lumber Jackson.

12:33.500 --> 12:34.500
- Right.
- Okay.

12:34.500 --> 12:37.500
You ready? Okay, you're the QB.
You're the running back.

12:37.500 --> 12:38.500
Giving you the ball. Run with it.

12:38.500 --> 12:41.500
You need to write down
all the technical mumbo jumbo

12:41.500 --> 12:43.500
so the Bey understands what this thing is.

12:43.500 --> 12:44.500
- Right?
- That's a lot of work.

12:45.500 --> 12:47.500
Darren, I'm gonna get you markers,
a poster board.

12:47.500 --> 12:49.500
You're gonna draw Lumber Jackson

12:49.500 --> 12:52.500
so beautifully, muscles just popping.

12:52.500 --> 12:54.500
Shredded, baby!

12:54.500 --> 12:57.500
And you're gonna draw the Skintendo.
Right? The whole Joysuit.

12:57.500 --> 13:00.500
Make it look pretty, and then I'm gonna
pitch that motherfucker.

13:00.500 --> 13:03.500
- Okay.
- Dollar-dollar bills, y'all.

13:03.500 --> 13:06.500
Boom! Put it in.

13:06.500 --> 13:07.500
Dew'd Crew in full effect!

13:07.500 --> 13:12.500
Finally fulfilling our destiny
of being childhood billionaires.

13:12.500 --> 13:13.500
Let's do it! Hands in.

13:13.500 --> 13:15.500
Everybody put your hands in.
Hands in.

13:15.500 --> 13:17.500
Put your fist in. Put your fist in.

13:17.500 --> 13:19.500
Dew'd Crew!

13:19.500 --> 13:21.500
- I fucking love you guys. I'm so excited.
- Okay.

13:21.500 --> 13:24.500
- Yes! I'll go get supplies.
- All right.

13:24.500 --> 13:27.500
Yeah, just go get
those markers, man. Sick.

13:27.500 --> 13:28.500
What the fuck was that?

13:28.500 --> 13:29.500
What?

13:29.500 --> 13:31.500
I mean, c-come on.
He's gonna pitch something.

13:31.500 --> 13:32.500
It might as well be Skintendo.

13:33.500 --> 13:34.500
Listen, dum-dum.

13:34.500 --> 13:36.500
We can't pitch any of the upgrades.

13:36.500 --> 13:40.500
We can't pitch the wireless connectivity,
the friend-controller mode.

13:40.500 --> 13:43.500
Because if we do, Alexxx is gonna know

13:43.500 --> 13:45.500
that we've been
working on Skintendo without him.

13:45.500 --> 13:47.500
I'm just sick of working here, all right?

13:47.500 --> 13:48.500
We should've told him from the beginning.

13:49.500 --> 13:50.500
No, no. What?

13:50.500 --> 13:52.500
He would've turned it
into some moneymaking idea,

13:52.500 --> 13:54.500
and that's not what it is to us. Right?

13:54.500 --> 13:56.500
- Right.
- And we're not gonna tell him now,

13:56.500 --> 13:58.500
'cause he'll probably just...

13:58.500 --> 14:00.500
kill himself. Or someone. I don't know.

14:00.500 --> 14:03.500
I can just see him going into a rage
and, biting people. Children.

14:04.500 --> 14:06.500
Bitten children. Blood on your hands.

14:06.500 --> 14:07.500
Fine.

14:07.500 --> 14:10.500
So we pitch Bey, he laughs us off,

14:10.500 --> 14:14.500
and we go back to working on the idea...
together, secretly.

14:17.500 --> 14:18.500
The fuck is that?

14:19.500 --> 14:21.500
- It's a vape pen, Baby Dunc.
- Okay.

14:21.500 --> 14:23.500
Well, you look like a tool
smoking that thing.

14:23.500 --> 14:25.500
Well, I'm not "smoking" it.

14:25.500 --> 14:27.500
I'm vaping it.

14:32.500 --> 14:34.500
Ah, these your boys?

14:35.500 --> 14:37.500
I believe so. Mr. Drothers.

14:37.500 --> 14:41.500
- Mr. Ahmad. We spoke over the phone.
- Please. Conrad.

14:41.500 --> 14:45.500
- This is Donald. This is Erma.
- You brought your girlfriend, huh?

14:45.500 --> 14:47.500
I'm not his girlfriend.

14:48.500 --> 14:49.500
Noted.

14:50.500 --> 14:52.500
So did you guys meet up with Ray?

14:52.500 --> 14:54.500
Ray isn't going to make it.

14:54.500 --> 14:57.500
But I assure you, he briefed me.
Thoroughly.

14:59.500 --> 15:01.500
Okay, Conrad.

15:02.500 --> 15:05.500
If Ray briefed you so thoroughly...

15:05.500 --> 15:08.500
...he left out the most important detail
of the evening.

15:16.500 --> 15:17.500
No hats.

15:18.500 --> 15:21.500
No hats. I guess the Bey likes
to be the only guy wearing a hat.

15:21.500 --> 15:24.500
Which I get, you know,
'cause I'm a hat guy myself.

15:24.500 --> 15:27.500
But really, love the Kangol, but...

15:28.500 --> 15:29.500
Maybe call you Kangol-roo.

15:29.500 --> 15:30.500
Uh...

15:30.500 --> 15:33.500
Kangol-roo, huh? How about that?

15:33.500 --> 15:34.500
Come on. Let's go have a party, huh?

15:34.500 --> 15:35.500
Let's have some fun.

15:36.500 --> 15:38.500
I'm gonna dance with you tonight, my dear.

15:42.500 --> 15:45.500
<i>* Have a word for your brother *</i>

15:45.500 --> 15:48.500
<i>* Have some time for one another *</i>

15:48.500 --> 15:51.500
<i>* Really love one another *</i>

15:51.500 --> 15:54.500
<i>* It's so hard to find *</i>

15:55.500 --> 15:57.500
<i>* Have a word for your brother, *</i>

15:58.500 --> 15:59.500
Whoo!

15:59.500 --> 16:01.500
Catch me, dudes!

16:01.500 --> 16:04.500
<i>* Really love one another, *</i>

16:04.500 --> 16:07.500
Yeah, so I met Bey...
uh, he was doing a TED Talk

16:07.500 --> 16:10.500
in Vegas, on being 'bout it.

16:10.500 --> 16:12.500
We had a moment,
and now we're good friends.

16:12.500 --> 16:16.500
Well, we're not good friends, actually.
I w, I would say, acquaintances.

16:17.500 --> 16:19.500
You know what?
I'm hoping to meet him tonight.

16:19.500 --> 16:21.500
Keep your eyes peeled.
The Bey's somewhere here.

16:23.500 --> 16:27.500
Excuse me, Mr. Bronson.
Can I interest you in a pulled pork...

16:27.500 --> 16:28.500
barbecue quesadilla...

16:29.500 --> 16:31.500
with corn relish.

16:35.500 --> 16:37.500
Fuck, that's fuckin' delicious, man.

16:38.500 --> 16:39.500
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.500
- He spit it out but said it was delicious.
- Yes.

16:42.500 --> 16:45.500
Maybe he's watching his calorie intake.
He is wearing athletic wear.

16:45.500 --> 16:47.500
Ho-ly shit.

16:47.500 --> 16:48.500
There he is...

16:49.500 --> 16:50.500
the Bey.

16:51.500 --> 16:54.500
My God, he is the man.

16:54.500 --> 16:57.500
Even his little dog
has 100,500 followers.

16:57.500 --> 16:59.500
- Wow.
- Yeah, I don't know,

16:59.500 --> 17:00.500
it looks like he's having fun.

17:00.500 --> 17:02.500
We should probably
just let him do his thang.

17:02.500 --> 17:05.500
Maybe we hang in the cut?
You know, have him come to us?

17:05.500 --> 17:07.500
"The cut"? There's no cut.

17:07.500 --> 17:09.500
Action's in the cut.

17:09.500 --> 17:11.500
We're not gonna be in the cut if...
whatever.

17:11.500 --> 17:12.500
Let's go. It's game time.

17:12.500 --> 17:15.500
yo, I had this pet hyena once, right?

17:15.500 --> 17:16.500
Then that motherfucker died. Ehh!

17:16.500 --> 17:18.500
More appeteezees for the Bey.

17:18.500 --> 17:21.500
Then I had that motherfucker stuffed,
put a Fleshlight in back,

17:21.500 --> 17:23.500
and then I fucked the shit out that bitch.

17:23.500 --> 17:26.500
It's like necrophilia
and bestiality in one.

17:26.500 --> 17:28.500
It's hilarious!

17:28.500 --> 17:30.500
That is hilarious.

17:30.500 --> 17:32.500
Pulled pork quesadilla...

17:32.500 --> 17:35.500
- with a corn relish, anyone?
- Yo.

17:35.500 --> 17:38.500
That sounds bomb as fyuck right now.

17:38.500 --> 17:39.500
Throw one into my open mouth.

17:39.500 --> 17:40.500
- Really?
- Yeah, bro.

17:40.500 --> 17:42.500
- Okay.
- Ah...

17:43.500 --> 17:46.500
- I nailed it!
- Make it rain!

17:46.500 --> 17:47.500
- Makin' it rain!
- Come on!

17:48.500 --> 17:51.500
that shit was dope.
I'm covered in grease, baby.

17:51.500 --> 17:53.500
- Yo, you're my dude.
- Thank you so much.

17:53.500 --> 17:55.500
And this shit is on punto.

17:55.500 --> 17:57.500
um...

17:57.500 --> 17:58.500
Bey-Bey, may I ask you a question?

17:58.500 --> 18:01.500
- What that, bro?
- Do you like black people?

18:04.500 --> 18:05.500
Because Lumber Jackson is the first

18:06.500 --> 18:09.500
full-body-controlled
blaxploitation video game ever.

18:09.500 --> 18:11.500
Now, using our revolutionary
Skintendo Joysuit technology...

18:12.500 --> 18:14.500
Excuse me. Step away immediately.

18:14.500 --> 18:16.500
Yo, Ahmad, chill the fuck out, bro.

18:16.500 --> 18:18.500
I'm trying to listen to the man.

18:18.500 --> 18:19.500
- Thank you.
- I'm chilled out.

18:19.500 --> 18:21.500
I arranged this chilled-out party.

18:22.500 --> 18:23.500
I got Shaggy to perform.

18:23.500 --> 18:24.500
Uh, Shaggy?

18:24.500 --> 18:27.500
Man, busted-ass Shaggy
ain't performing shit, a'ight?

18:27.500 --> 18:29.500
And put that dusty-ass BlackBerry away.

18:29.500 --> 18:31.500
This primitive-ass,
prehistoric motherfucker.

18:31.500 --> 18:34.500
I'm sorry, guys, 2018,
this dude ain't got a touch screen?

18:34.500 --> 18:35.500
You big fucking tree.

18:35.500 --> 18:37.500
Goddamn.

18:37.500 --> 18:39.500
What a bitch-ass.

18:39.500 --> 18:41.500
- He's just a butler.
- Yeah, you suck.

18:41.500 --> 18:43.500
Yeah, you got low self-esteem.
Fuck off, bro.

18:43.500 --> 18:45.500
Anyway, you were saying, my dude?

18:45.500 --> 18:47.500
That suit controls
that video game character?

18:48.500 --> 18:49.500
- Yes, actually.
- yeah.

18:49.500 --> 18:51.500
- And here...
- Yeah, this is the schematics right here.

18:51.500 --> 18:53.500
You know, I built it, programmed it.

18:53.500 --> 18:55.500
My God.

18:55.500 --> 18:57.500
Bro, please approach us
and just unzip your trousers

18:57.500 --> 18:59.500
and pull that dick out
so we could just see

18:59.500 --> 19:02.500
what the penis head of a genius
really looks like.

19:02.500 --> 19:04.500
- Know what I'm saying?
- Pull your dick out.

19:04.500 --> 19:07.500
Well, to be honest
it would be my penis head pulled out.

19:07.500 --> 19:09.500
I'm the genius that came up
with the whole concept, the idea.

19:09.500 --> 19:10.500
I'm not gonna pull my dick out.

19:11.500 --> 19:12.500
okay.
That's a cute little cartoon,

19:12.500 --> 19:14.500
but did you build the motherfucker?

19:14.500 --> 19:16.500
- Yeah, no, we have.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, we built it.

19:16.500 --> 19:18.500
And there's actually
some new features too,

19:18.500 --> 19:19.500
like friend-control mode,

19:20.500 --> 19:23.500
where you can actually control
the person wearing the Skintendo Joysuit.

19:23.500 --> 19:25.500
It's, it's revolutionary.

19:25.500 --> 19:28.500
Damn. yo, yo,
I'm gonna need, like, three of those

19:28.500 --> 19:30.500
for, like, blap, blap, blap.
You know what I'm saying?

19:30.500 --> 19:33.500
'Cause I love fucking white women.
Makes me feel powerful,

19:33.500 --> 19:35.500
especially if I can control them,
you know what I mean?

19:35.500 --> 19:39.500
Yes! I forgot about friend-control mode.
But you know who didn't forget about it?

19:39.500 --> 19:43.500
Sony and Microsoft
when we pitched them this idea.

19:43.500 --> 19:45.500
And they were super into it.
But you know what I said to them?

19:45.500 --> 19:47.500
Fuck y'all!

19:47.500 --> 19:49.500
'Cause the Dew'd Crew
wants to do business with the Bey.

19:49.500 --> 19:51.500
The Dew'd Crew? Wait, wait, wait.
Time-out, time-out.

19:52.500 --> 19:53.500
'Cause y'all drink mad Mountain Dew?

19:53.500 --> 19:54.500
You got it!

19:54.500 --> 19:56.500
Yes, that's exactly right.

19:56.500 --> 19:57.500
- How did you...
- Wow.

19:57.500 --> 20:01.500
Yo, motherfucker, me too! Holy shit, dude!

20:01.500 --> 20:04.500
- You ever fuck with Baja Blast?
- you know I do. You know I do!

20:04.500 --> 20:05.500
- So good.
- Ah, man...

20:05.500 --> 20:07.500
- Code Red over here!
- This is Code Red boy.

20:07.500 --> 20:08.500
Fuck, I love you guys!

20:09.500 --> 20:11.500
Let's talk numbers.
How much money we talking about?

20:11.500 --> 20:13.500
Bey Awadi. Sorry, this, this feels like

20:13.500 --> 20:16.500
just the sort of frivolous investment
we spoke about not partaking in.

20:16.500 --> 20:21.500
My dude, just because you told me not to,
why don't you "par-take" my checkbook out

20:21.500 --> 20:24.500
and then write these motherfuckers
a check

20:24.500 --> 20:27.500
for 200-frivolous-fucking-thousand-dollars

20:27.500 --> 20:30.500
so they can chase their goddamn dreams?
Am I right? Yezzir.

20:30.500 --> 20:32.500
and then please scrub out
my hyena's pussy,

20:32.500 --> 20:34.500
'cause I'm trying to fuck that shit later.

20:34.500 --> 20:36.500
You should fuck it.

20:36.500 --> 20:37.500
Treat yo'self. My God!

20:37.500 --> 20:39.500
Cool. Get the fuck out of here.

20:39.500 --> 20:41.500
- My God. Yeah. Okay.
- Go. Get out, get out.

20:41.500 --> 20:42.500
We'll talk more numbers later.

20:42.500 --> 20:44.500
- Thank you.
- Bye, take care.

20:44.500 --> 20:47.500
All right, y'all.
I'm spending paper tonight.

20:47.500 --> 20:48.500
It's just the beginning!

20:49.500 --> 20:50.500
Not happening.

20:51.500 --> 20:53.500
Apologies, Corky.
Let's go, boys. Let's go.

20:54.500 --> 20:55.500
Let's go!

20:55.500 --> 20:58.500
Cassie! Cassie! Tums!

20:59.500 --> 21:00.500
Tums, meet me at the elevator.

21:00.500 --> 21:02.500
- Come on, boys.
- But our check.

21:09.500 --> 21:11.500
- Fuck off.
- Yeah, I was just...

21:13.500 --> 21:14.500
Yeah, we're going.

21:14.500 --> 21:18.500
- Get up. Get out of here.
- Ow. Goddamn.

21:21.500 --> 21:25.500
These three idiots just tried to sell
a goddamn video game to the Bey!

21:26.500 --> 21:27.500
I thought I told you to sack up!

21:27.500 --> 21:29.500
I'm sorry. I didn't...

21:29.500 --> 21:32.500
You didn't...
you didn't want that promotion?

21:32.500 --> 21:34.500
Yeah, you made that pretty clear.

21:35.500 --> 21:37.500
Boys! You're fired.

21:37.500 --> 21:39.500
- Yeah.
- No fucking way, Mitch.

21:39.500 --> 21:40.500
He was assaulted.

21:40.500 --> 21:42.500
Out! Out you go!

21:43.500 --> 21:45.500
- We're going.
- Cassie...

21:46.500 --> 21:49.500
- ...get back to work.
- Yes, sir.

21:53.500 --> 21:56.500
That's quite a stiff arm
you got there, huh?

21:56.500 --> 22:00.500
You all right? Huh?
That paw of yours need a little ice?

22:01.500 --> 22:04.500
- My hand is fine.
- Ah.

22:04.500 --> 22:07.500
Well, how about a little ice
for those nipples, huh?

22:11.500 --> 22:13.500
Oh-ho-ho-ho.

22:13.500 --> 22:15.500
Yeah, you like that, huh?

22:15.500 --> 22:16.500
that's hot.

22:17.500 --> 22:19.500
that is hot, lady.

22:19.500 --> 22:20.500
You wanna play?

22:20.500 --> 22:22.500
- I do.
- Okay.

22:22.500 --> 22:25.500
- I knew it. Oh.
- What about this?

22:25.500 --> 22:27.500
- Yeah. Ooh.
- Mm.

22:27.500 --> 22:29.500
Speaking of stiff...

22:33.500 --> 22:36.500
Not my pecker!

22:38.500 --> 22:40.500
Whoopsie-daisy.

22:40.500 --> 22:42.500
All I'm saying is,

22:42.500 --> 22:44.500
you win some, you lose some.

22:44.500 --> 22:48.500
The key to our jiggy fuckin' lifestyle
is tucked in that butler's pocket.

22:48.500 --> 22:51.500
My name is Alexxx with three Xs.

22:53.500 --> 22:55.500
I'm about to go explosive
on these motherfuckers!

22:56.500 --> 22:58.500
Three X means "poison," by the way.

22:58.500 --> 23:01.500
- Uh, it's also a Vin Diesel movie.
- Shut the fuck up.

23:01.500 --> 23:03.500
Yeah, well, it's also
spicy barbecue sauce.

23:03.500 --> 23:06.500
But I think we all know
I meant it in the explicit fashion!

23:09.500 --> 23:12.500
My darling, have you lost
your fucking mind?

23:13.500 --> 23:16.500
Get him out of here. If they see him
before we secure the build...

23:24.500 --> 23:25.500
Lock down all exits.

23:25.500 --> 23:28.500
<i>We have three waiters on the run
and they know.</i>

23:28.500 --> 23:30.500
<i>Donald, it's time.</i>

23:31.500 --> 23:32.500
Copy that.

23:34.500 --> 23:38.500
fellas. Bey Awadi's security here.
We just have one question.

23:38.500 --> 23:39.500
What's your question?

23:39.500 --> 23:42.500
- Do you wanna die?
- What?

23:44.500 --> 23:46.500
hey, hey.

24:03.500 --> 24:04.500
What, y'all don't pack a lunch?

24:04.500 --> 24:07.500
Man, take these clowns up to the roof
with the rest.

24:07.500 --> 24:08.500
- Okay.
- Let's go.

24:08.500 --> 24:09.500
Easy, man.

24:09.500 --> 24:11.500
Locking down perimeter now.

24:11.500 --> 24:14.500
<i>Attention, all units.
</i> Operation Trespass begins now.

24:14.500 --> 24:16.500
Sweep the hotel.

24:16.500 --> 24:19.500
Lock and arm all exits
with breach sensors.

24:19.500 --> 24:21.500
We are taking over.

24:21.500 --> 24:23.500
- Move! Get down, stay down.
- everybody be calm!

24:23.500 --> 24:25.500
Just do what they say.
Everything's gonna be okay.

24:25.500 --> 24:27.500
Right? Right?

24:30.500 --> 24:33.500
shit! fuck!

24:33.500 --> 24:35.500
Shit. Fuck.

24:36.500 --> 24:39.500
Yo, what the fuck, man?
You're supposed to be guarding the party.

24:39.500 --> 24:40.500
Party's over.

24:50.500 --> 24:52.500
Darren,
stop vaping, all right?

24:52.500 --> 24:55.500
- I can't breathe!
- Just shut up! Okay?

24:55.500 --> 24:57.500
As these doors open,
they're gonna be waiting,

24:57.500 --> 24:59.500
ready to cut cocks.

25:00.500 --> 25:01.500
We'll hide. Hide in the shaft.

25:01.500 --> 25:03.500
- Here, just help me up. Help me up.
- What?

25:03.500 --> 25:06.500
- Ow. Just, what are you doing?
- Oh, oh!

25:06.500 --> 25:08.500
- I found the latch.
- seriously?

25:08.500 --> 25:09.500
- I think I found it.
- Well, go, get in.

25:13.500 --> 25:15.500
Shit.

25:15.500 --> 25:17.500
They climbed into the elevator shaft.

25:17.500 --> 25:20.500
They could be anywhere.
Keep your eyes open.

25:28.500 --> 25:30.500
Gotta just get the thing...

25:30.500 --> 25:33.500
- You said you found a latch.
- No, I said I think I found a latch.

25:33.500 --> 25:35.500
Shut up, Baby Dunc.

25:35.500 --> 25:36.500
Whoa.

25:36.500 --> 25:37.500
No one's there.

25:38.500 --> 25:39.500
Follow me.

25:41.500 --> 25:42.500
Wait, I think we should turn ourselves in.

25:42.500 --> 25:43.500
What? No. Go!

25:44.500 --> 25:45.500
Not turning ourselves in.
That's pussy shit.

25:45.500 --> 25:47.500
They might appreciate the gesture.

25:47.500 --> 25:50.500
Yeah, and they might cut our dicks off.
We gotta get out and go for help.

25:50.500 --> 25:52.500
We're not gonna go for help.
Slide down this rail.

25:52.500 --> 25:53.500
- It'll be badass.
- What?

25:54.500 --> 25:55.500
Yeah.

25:57.500 --> 25:58.500
shit.

25:59.500 --> 26:02.500
- I need help.
- That was not badass. Come on!

26:07.500 --> 26:09.500
All exits confirmed as locked.

26:09.500 --> 26:11.500
No sign of the waiters.

26:15.500 --> 26:17.500
They locked the doors
and we don't have our phones!

26:17.500 --> 26:19.500
- We're screwed!
- No shit, Baby Dunc.

26:20.500 --> 26:21.500
We gotta get a landline.

26:28.500 --> 26:29.500
Clear.

26:32.500 --> 26:35.500
- I got two.
- Quick, take 'em up with the rest.

26:35.500 --> 26:36.500
<i>?ndale, bitch.</i>

26:42.500 --> 26:43.500
Let's move.

26:47.500 --> 26:50.500
Tie them together.

26:50.500 --> 26:52.500
One collar per group.

26:52.500 --> 26:55.500
Now, listen up, if you want to live.

26:55.500 --> 26:57.500
These collars are linked to sensors

26:57.500 --> 27:02.500
that we have placed
at every entrance of this building.

27:02.500 --> 27:06.500
Anyone who attempts to enter or exit,

27:07.500 --> 27:08.500
they detonate.

27:09.500 --> 27:11.500
It's fucked up, right?

27:11.500 --> 27:13.500
- You missed me.
- Collect their cell phones

27:13.500 --> 27:15.500
if they still have them.

27:15.500 --> 27:18.500
And if they try anything funny, well...

27:19.500 --> 27:23.500
...refrain from killing anyone
unless I tell you.

27:23.500 --> 27:24.500
We're not here to murder.

27:24.500 --> 27:26.500
We're here to collect a toll
from Bey Awadi

27:26.500 --> 27:28.500
for trespassing on American soil.

27:29.500 --> 27:31.500
You ain't touching my stacks, bro.

27:31.500 --> 27:32.500
Really?

27:32.500 --> 27:34.500
"In case of threat of violence
or act of terror,

27:34.500 --> 27:37.500
please do not challenge
or defy assailants.

27:37.500 --> 27:39.500
Comply with their demands at all times."

27:39.500 --> 27:41.500
Did you read that in the manual
or something?

27:41.500 --> 27:42.500
No.

27:42.500 --> 27:44.500
Well, yes, but, who cares?

27:44.500 --> 27:46.500
It gives me everything I need
to keep the hotel in order,

27:46.500 --> 27:49.500
- no matter what.
- This lady just shit her pants.

27:49.500 --> 27:50.500
Is that in the manual too?

27:50.500 --> 27:54.500
I, I did, I did not shit my pants.

27:54.500 --> 27:56.500
I just want to make that clear.

27:56.500 --> 27:57.500
Are you calling me a liar?

27:58.500 --> 28:00.500
No, I'm saying you're very smart
and you're picking up on something.

28:00.500 --> 28:03.500
Maybe someone...
someone did shit their pants.

28:03.500 --> 28:05.500
And I'm not gonna say who.

28:06.500 --> 28:08.500
- But someone.
- Get her out of here.

28:08.500 --> 28:12.500
- Yeah, get her out of here. Damn it.
- Get you out of here.

28:12.500 --> 28:14.500
it's dripping.

28:14.500 --> 28:15.500
And now it hit my anklet.

28:15.500 --> 28:17.500
And my toe ring.

28:19.500 --> 28:21.500
We are locked down, boss.

28:21.500 --> 28:24.500
And I'm very close
to accessing the offshore accounts.

28:24.500 --> 28:25.500
<i>I know, I know.</i>

28:25.500 --> 28:28.500
"Close only counts
in horseshoes and hand grenades."

28:28.500 --> 28:30.500
I wasn't gonna say that.

28:30.500 --> 28:31.500
The phones are dead.

28:31.500 --> 28:34.500
No Internet either. No Wi-Fi, no DSL.

28:34.500 --> 28:37.500
Jesus, this guy has so many tabs open.
It's stressing me the fuck out.

28:37.500 --> 28:39.500
Guys, they cut the lines.

28:39.500 --> 28:40.500
It's what they do.

28:42.500 --> 28:44.500
It's, what I'd do.

28:45.500 --> 28:47.500
stop talking cool. Okay?

28:50.500 --> 28:51.500
Clear.

28:56.500 --> 28:58.500
My God. There's two guys
out there with guns.

28:58.500 --> 29:00.500
- They're coming this way.
- That's it. I'm done.

29:00.500 --> 29:03.500
Wait, what are you...
What's with the pockets?

29:03.500 --> 29:05.500
- I'm showing them I'm unarmed.
- Shut up.

29:05.500 --> 29:07.500
We can think of something.
We can take 'em.

29:07.500 --> 29:09.500
Darren, just think of something.

29:09.500 --> 29:11.500
I can't. I got nothing, man.

29:11.500 --> 29:14.500
- I...
- Fine.

29:15.500 --> 29:17.500
- What are you...
- I got an idea.

29:18.500 --> 29:20.500
I haven't done this in a long time.

29:31.500 --> 29:35.500
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

29:44.500 --> 29:45.500
What the fuck?

29:47.500 --> 29:49.500
Look at this freaky fuck.

29:49.500 --> 29:51.500
Rich, come in here.
You gotta see this.

29:54.500 --> 29:55.500
Jesus.

29:55.500 --> 29:57.500
Rest in peace, you horny bastard.

30:00.500 --> 30:01.500
What's your problem?

30:02.500 --> 30:03.500
I just don't like the way
this job is going.

30:04.500 --> 30:06.500
- Everything's falling apart.
- Ah. hey, hey.

30:07.500 --> 30:10.500
By this time tomorrow,
we'll be sitting poolside

30:10.500 --> 30:12.500
sipping Coronas in Cabo, right?

30:14.500 --> 30:16.500
I just don't wanna see you getting hurt.

30:16.500 --> 30:18.500
You're sweet.

30:18.500 --> 30:20.500
I love you.

30:23.500 --> 30:24.500
I love you too.

30:32.500 --> 30:33.500
- Yeah.
- Real quick.

30:33.500 --> 30:34.500
Okay, yeah.

30:52.500 --> 30:53.500
Ew, right?

30:57.500 --> 30:59.500
- Stop!
- Sorry.

30:59.500 --> 31:01.500
Hmm?

31:01.500 --> 31:05.500
You go around,
grab the corner of the sheet...

31:17.500 --> 31:18.500
Psst!

31:29.500 --> 31:30.500
Hit 'em with the lamp!

31:30.500 --> 31:32.500
Wha...

31:39.500 --> 31:40.500
I am so sorry. I am so sorry.

31:41.500 --> 31:43.500
Are you all right?

31:46.500 --> 31:47.500
Rich? Rich?

31:50.500 --> 31:52.500
- Ow.
- Uh...

31:52.500 --> 31:55.500
Freeze! Shit.

31:55.500 --> 31:58.500
You just killed the man of my dreams.

31:58.500 --> 31:59.500
- Now you're gonna die.
- No, no.

31:59.500 --> 32:03.500
He's just knocked out. Like the movie
<i>Friday. "He got knocked the fuck out!"</i>

32:10.500 --> 32:13.500
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I killed him.

32:13.500 --> 32:14.500
I'll be your boyfriend.

32:23.500 --> 32:25.500
I didn't do it.

32:32.500 --> 32:34.500
Baby Dunc, are you okay?

32:36.500 --> 32:37.500
I think you killed him.

32:40.500 --> 32:41.500
Sorry I didn't help,

32:41.500 --> 32:44.500
but I got punched in the chest
really hard one time.

32:46.500 --> 32:50.500
We killed the bad guys. My plan worked!

32:50.500 --> 32:51.500
What, hey, stop it!

32:51.500 --> 32:53.500
Your plan didn't work.
You got them horny

32:53.500 --> 32:54.500
and got me 300 kicked in the chest.

32:54.500 --> 32:56.500
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine!

32:56.500 --> 32:58.500
We got these bitches
right where we want them.

32:58.500 --> 33:01.500
- Now we gotta just go through their shit.
- Alexxx, no! No!

33:01.500 --> 33:03.500
Leave their stuff alone.
You're gonna make them madder.

33:03.500 --> 33:05.500
Baby Dunc, what are you talking about?
This is video games 101.

33:06.500 --> 33:08.500
- You kill bad guys, you take their shit.
- It's true.

33:09.500 --> 33:10.500
Like you never played video games.

33:10.500 --> 33:12.500
- Go close the fucking door.
- Okay, yeah.

33:13.500 --> 33:14.500
We got zip ties.

33:16.500 --> 33:19.500
We got a fucking gun.
We got a big-ass knife.

33:19.500 --> 33:22.500
By the way, I get next kill.
You guys are being total kill hogs...

33:25.500 --> 33:29.500
- What did you do?
- Okay, and that is where the trigger is.

33:29.500 --> 33:30.500
- My God.
- Now we know that.

33:30.500 --> 33:32.500
I'm gonna go put on pants, so...

33:33.500 --> 33:34.500
yeah, no. Good call, good call,

33:34.500 --> 33:37.500
you're gonna wanna be fully clothed
when you fucking blow your head off, man!

33:37.500 --> 33:39.500
Why are you getting dressed in the closet?

33:39.500 --> 33:41.500
We've already seen
your dick, balls, and butthole.

33:42.500 --> 33:45.500
- You guys saw my butthole?
- A lot.

33:45.500 --> 33:47.500
- I haven't shaved in months.
- Okay, this is it.

33:47.500 --> 33:51.500
I'm stressing out. Alexxx, get back here
and sell me salvia right now, man!

33:51.500 --> 33:53.500
Yeah, Darren,
I'm not gonna sell you salvia right now

33:53.500 --> 33:57.500
'cause we're kind of under attack
from terrorists.

33:57.500 --> 33:59.500
Every time you open that, I see your dick.
We need to get outta here.

33:59.500 --> 34:04.500
We need to get away from bad people.
We need to get help from good people.

34:04.500 --> 34:07.500
If you wanna bail on the Bey
and the Skintendo Joysuit to go get help,

34:07.500 --> 34:09.500
fine, we can do that.

34:09.500 --> 34:10.500
But we gotta do it in a badass fashion,

34:11.500 --> 34:13.500
or we're gonna look
like total fucking pussies.

34:13.500 --> 34:14.500
We are pussies!

34:14.500 --> 34:17.500
- We don't have to look like it, Baby Dunc!
- Don't call me that.

34:17.500 --> 34:19.500
Darren, think of something dope
and badass to get us out.

34:19.500 --> 34:22.500
- What?
- Baby Dunc, implement the thing

34:22.500 --> 34:24.500
that Darren's about to think of. Go.

34:26.500 --> 34:27.500
I'm not coming up with the plan, okay?

34:37.500 --> 34:40.500
- Shit! I thought of something.
- What?

34:40.500 --> 34:41.500
Is it something I can build?

34:42.500 --> 34:44.500
- Yeah.
- Fuck.

34:44.500 --> 34:46.500
Why do I have to be
so goddamn industrious?

34:47.500 --> 34:50.500
guys?
If you guys thought my dick was small,

34:50.500 --> 34:52.500
it's 'cause the AC
was really blasting earlier.

34:52.500 --> 34:53.500
So that's the reason.

34:54.500 --> 34:57.500
- It's super hot, right?
- It's very hot.

34:57.500 --> 34:58.500
Alexxx, I...

34:59.500 --> 35:00.500
you've got nothing to be ashamed of.

35:06.500 --> 35:09.500
If you, don't pull too much on this one,
'cause then this one gets pulled.

35:12.500 --> 35:14.500
What the fuck, man?

35:14.500 --> 35:16.500
Eagle Eye has been watching you,
Bey Awadi.

35:16.500 --> 35:19.500
The, the U.S. militia faction?
What do they want with him?

35:20.500 --> 35:22.500
Sometimes the government's
politically correct hands

35:22.500 --> 35:24.500
get tied in knots, forcing people
to protect their lands

35:24.500 --> 35:26.500
from unwanted invasions.

35:26.500 --> 35:27.500
"Invasions."

35:28.500 --> 35:29.500
I'm not a fuckin' invader, bro.

35:29.500 --> 35:32.500
I love America. I went to Florida State.

35:32.500 --> 35:33.500
Peep the bill, bro.

35:33.500 --> 35:35.500
I'm here to have fun, fuck,

35:35.500 --> 35:37.500
drink, pop Molly.

35:37.500 --> 35:39.500
What's more American than that, bro?

35:39.500 --> 35:40.500
Money.

35:40.500 --> 35:43.500
Five hundred million dollars
transferred into an offshore account.

35:43.500 --> 35:46.500
Five hundred million?
You are crazy, Mr. Albino Bad Guy.

35:46.500 --> 35:48.500
That's not gonna happen.

35:48.500 --> 35:50.500
He doesn't have that kind of cash flow.

35:50.500 --> 35:52.500
I-it's all tied up in assets bonds...

35:53.500 --> 35:56.500
Does this free up some of those assets?

35:56.500 --> 35:58.500
I get it.

35:58.500 --> 36:01.500
This is a prank.
It's just kind of dark, man, like...

36:01.500 --> 36:03.500
Knoxville, you can come out now!

36:03.500 --> 36:06.500
No! Steve-O! Steve, you okay?

36:06.500 --> 36:09.500
- Come on, man. We told you we can't.
- Th-th-there is a way.

36:10.500 --> 36:11.500
dear.

36:11.500 --> 36:14.500
An account a-access code.
Only he and his father have it.

36:14.500 --> 36:16.500
What the fuck are you doing?

36:16.500 --> 36:18.500
He's playing nice.

36:18.500 --> 36:20.500
Now it's your turn.

36:20.500 --> 36:23.500
I can't, okay?
If, if I give you those codes,

36:23.500 --> 36:26.500
- my dad'll kill me, a'ight?
- What's its name?

36:26.500 --> 36:28.500
Wh, what?

36:28.500 --> 36:29.500
The dog.

36:29.500 --> 36:31.500
The dog?

36:31.500 --> 36:33.500
- Mm.
- Lil Puma.

36:33.500 --> 36:34.500
Little Puma. Hi, pal.

36:34.500 --> 36:37.500
that's a good boy.

36:37.500 --> 36:38.500
Come to Uncle Conrad.

36:38.500 --> 36:40.500
We have a couple
of those extra breach sensors.

36:40.500 --> 36:42.500
Get them with a corresponding collar.

36:43.500 --> 36:45.500
Be careful with his hip dysplasia, please.

36:45.500 --> 36:48.500
Of course, of course.
You know, I love dogs. Big dogs, usually.

36:48.500 --> 36:50.500
Little dogs not much, but this one

36:50.500 --> 36:52.500
has a great personality.

36:52.500 --> 36:54.500
No, no, no. What, what are you doing?

36:56.500 --> 36:58.500
There you go, Lil Puma. Go get it, boy.

37:00.500 --> 37:02.500
- thank you very much.
- Don't do it.

37:02.500 --> 37:03.500
Puma, stay. Stay, Puma.

37:03.500 --> 37:06.500
No!

37:10.500 --> 37:12.500
Why is this thing beeping?

37:12.500 --> 37:15.500
shit!

37:21.500 --> 37:24.500
I must have given you the nine...
which was upside down.

37:25.500 --> 37:27.500
That is my bad.

37:27.500 --> 37:29.500
The lesson still stands.

37:30.500 --> 37:33.500
The account numbers,
or there will be more bloodshed.

37:35.500 --> 37:37.500
Do it, Bey Awadi.

37:40.500 --> 37:41.500
Okay. Okay, clear. Go.

37:41.500 --> 37:43.500
- Ready?
- Yeah.

37:48.500 --> 37:51.500
Zip-tie zip line. Baby Dunc, you genius.

37:51.500 --> 37:54.500
Uh, it was my idea.
You know, I saw the scaffolding.

37:54.500 --> 37:55.500
I said, "Home Alone-style zip line."

37:56.500 --> 37:58.500
- Okay, it's fine. Good work.
- Thanks.

37:58.500 --> 38:02.500
Okay. Are you ready to be Tom Brady?
Because that's what's about to go down.

38:02.500 --> 38:05.500
You're gonna become Tom Brady, Alexxx.

38:05.500 --> 38:06.500
- Fuckin' Tom Brady, dog.
- Yes.

38:06.500 --> 38:08.500
- Yeah, you're Tom Brady.
- Tom Brady, dog!

38:08.500 --> 38:10.500
Yeah, you're Tom Brady.

38:10.500 --> 38:13.500
Shh.

38:13.500 --> 38:16.500
Here we go.

38:22.500 --> 38:25.500
I'm Tom Brady!

38:25.500 --> 38:26.500
- Tom Brady!
<i>- * We the Brady Bunch *</i>

38:26.500 --> 38:29.500
<i>- * We the Brady Bunch *
- The what? What? Brady Bunch?</i>

38:30.500 --> 38:32.500
Do you think Tom Brady
is in The Brady Bunch?

38:33.500 --> 38:35.500
Yeah, it's the dad, right?

38:35.500 --> 38:36.500
- No.
- No, he isn't.

38:36.500 --> 38:38.500
I thought that's who we...

38:38.500 --> 38:41.500
He was cool, though. He was really cool.
He had a hell of a, arm.

38:41.500 --> 38:44.500
Okay, why don't you just show us
how my zip line works, Joel?

38:44.500 --> 38:46.500
- Yeah.
- Right, right. Um...

38:46.500 --> 38:50.500
Okay, so basically,
I rigged up this ironing board,

38:50.500 --> 38:52.500
- like a harness.
- Right.

38:52.500 --> 38:54.500
And then you kind of use it
like a hang glider. Okay...

38:54.500 --> 38:56.500
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

38:56.500 --> 38:57.500
Kevin McCallister would be proud.

38:57.500 --> 38:58.500
Maybe even Tom Brady.

38:59.500 --> 39:00.500
- Don't talk about Tom Brady.
- Who's he?

39:00.500 --> 39:02.500
- Just don't talk about him.
- All right.

39:02.500 --> 39:03.500
Quarterback.

39:03.500 --> 39:05.500
Here's what we're gonna do.

39:05.500 --> 39:08.500
We are gonna shoot rock, paper, scissors
to find out who goes first.

39:08.500 --> 39:11.500
Okay, but no "two out of three" bullshit.

39:11.500 --> 39:12.500
- Whoever wins wins.
- Right.

39:12.500 --> 39:14.500
- Fair and square, right? Okay.
- Yes, yeah.

39:14.500 --> 39:16.500
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.

39:16.500 --> 39:18.500
- Yes.
- Fuck!

39:18.500 --> 39:19.500
- Thank God.
- Fuck!

39:20.500 --> 39:22.500
Let's go again. Two out of three.
Let's be fair.

39:22.500 --> 39:24.500
- What? You just said...
- No, do not do this, okay?

39:24.500 --> 39:26.500
It could've happened to any of us,
just happened to you.

39:26.500 --> 39:29.500
Yeah, maybe, or maybe hella long ago, you guys were like,

39:29.500 --> 39:33.500
"If we ever do rock, paper, scissors with Alexxx, we should shoot paper."

39:34.500 --> 39:37.500
Because two guys shooting paper, that's suspect.

39:37.500 --> 39:39.500
- I can't...
- Yeah.

39:39.500 --> 39:40.500
Okay, just forget it.
Let's shoot again.

39:41.500 --> 39:43.500
- What? No.
- Yes, thank you, Baby Dunc.

39:43.500 --> 39:45.500
- How about, don't be a sore loser?
- Don't call me a loser.

39:45.500 --> 39:47.500
guys, stop fighting.

39:47.500 --> 39:48.500
We'll make a dummy and do a test run.

39:49.500 --> 39:52.500
- We have a dummy right here.
- No, we'll just use one of the dead bo...

40:05.500 --> 40:08.500
My God!

40:17.500 --> 40:19.500
God!

40:25.500 --> 40:26.500
A little help.

40:26.500 --> 40:27.500
Help!

40:28.500 --> 40:30.500
fuck.

40:37.500 --> 40:39.500
give me half your Which Wich.

40:39.500 --> 40:41.500
Well,
if I wanted to eat a half a sandwich,

40:41.500 --> 40:43.500
I'd have brought half a sandwich, Chet.

40:43.500 --> 40:44.500
Think you're pretty smart, huh?

40:44.500 --> 40:46.500
You the one installing
a seven-layer firewall

40:46.500 --> 40:49.500
to mask a $1/2-billion transaction
at the world's third-largest bank

40:49.500 --> 40:52.500
using only your wife's tablet,
or is that me?

40:52.500 --> 40:53.500
that's right. It's me.

40:59.500 --> 41:01.500
- Way to go, Baby Dunc.
- Huh?

41:01.500 --> 41:03.500
What? You, This is your plan!

41:03.500 --> 41:05.500
No, I said, "Home Alone-style zip line."

41:05.500 --> 41:07.500
This is Home Alone 3 at best.

41:07.500 --> 41:10.500
We were supposed to look cool as shit
coming out of the window,

41:10.500 --> 41:11.500
doing a badass exit.

41:11.500 --> 41:13.500
Now we look like a bunch of losers
hanging up here.

41:13.500 --> 41:14.500
God.

41:16.500 --> 41:18.500
- What the fuck?
- The police!

41:18.500 --> 41:19.500
we're up here!

41:20.500 --> 41:22.500
Thank you so much. Thank you, God.

41:22.500 --> 41:25.500
Police! Yeah! Holla! Hooty-hoo!

41:25.500 --> 41:28.500
-  shit.
- What the fuck?

41:28.500 --> 41:31.500
- My God.
- What are you doing up there?

41:31.500 --> 41:33.500
There are people in the hotel with guns!

41:33.500 --> 41:35.500
- No!
- Shooting people!

41:35.500 --> 41:37.500
- You're all fuckin' pigs!
- Get us down!

41:37.500 --> 41:38.500
Fuck you, copper!

41:38.500 --> 41:40.500
They're here to help us.

41:40.500 --> 41:43.500
We're not gonna look cool as shit getting saved by the LAPD.

41:43.500 --> 41:44.500
Do you even listen to Kendrick Lamar?

41:45.500 --> 41:46.500
Are there people up there with guns or not?

41:46.500 --> 41:48.500
Yes, there are! That is one right there!

41:48.500 --> 41:50.500
He is a man with a gun.
He tried to cut off our dicks.

41:50.500 --> 41:53.500
Fuck you.
You wish I touched your dick.

41:53.500 --> 41:55.500
We're coming up there.
What room number is that?

41:55.500 --> 41:57.500
- Nine seventeen!
- We're coming up there now!

41:58.500 --> 41:59.500
Don't fucking move.

42:05.500 --> 42:06.500
LAPD. Open the door.

42:09.500 --> 42:11.500
Are you aware you've got three waiters

42:11.500 --> 42:13.500
hanging outside the ninth-floor window?

42:14.500 --> 42:16.500
Sir, walking away from a cop
is a bad idea.

42:16.500 --> 42:20.500
I will arrest you for obstruction.
Open the fucking door!

42:20.500 --> 42:21.500
Shit.

42:24.500 --> 42:26.500
Officer down! Officer down!

42:26.500 --> 42:27.500
Hank, I need backup!

42:27.500 --> 42:30.500
I got you, Danny. I'm calling for backup.
I'm coming right now.

42:30.500 --> 42:32.500
- Stay there!
- No! No, no, no!

42:32.500 --> 42:35.500
- Don't leave us up here.
- Guys, it's too late. Okay?

42:35.500 --> 42:36.500
Let's wiggle our asses back in there,

42:36.500 --> 42:38.500
kill some bad guys,
and get our fucking check back.

42:38.500 --> 42:40.500
I'm not risking my life for the check.

42:40.500 --> 42:42.500
Why not? It's our dreams, right?

42:42.500 --> 42:46.500
No! The check is your dream.
My dream is just working on Skintendo.

42:46.500 --> 42:47.500
But now you can!

42:47.500 --> 42:50.500
And we are! Okay? We have been!

42:50.500 --> 42:52.500
- Baby Dunc...
- Without you!

42:55.500 --> 42:57.500
what the fuck?

42:58.500 --> 43:00.500
Band-Aids and butter beans! We're online.

43:02.500 --> 43:04.500
Conrad, we're online.
Awaiting an access code.

43:06.500 --> 43:08.500
Speak clearly.

43:09.500 --> 43:10.500
And speak quickly.

43:11.500 --> 43:13.500
Fuck. Fuck!

43:14.500 --> 43:15.500
Fifty-three...

43:16.500 --> 43:17.500
Twenty-two...

43:18.500 --> 43:20.500
Zero two...

43:20.500 --> 43:21.500
Zero two...

43:21.500 --> 43:24.500
- Thirty-three...
- Thirty-three...

43:24.500 --> 43:26.500
- Sixty-nine.
- Six-nine.

43:28.500 --> 43:30.500
I want verbal confirmation
from you, Darren.

43:30.500 --> 43:32.500
Are you working on the fucking game
without me?

43:33.500 --> 43:34.500
Affirmative.

43:35.500 --> 43:37.500
You motherfuckers!

43:37.500 --> 43:40.500
I'm gonna wiggle us back in there,
you backstabbing bitches!

43:46.500 --> 43:48.500
Sixty-nine, 420, 69.

43:48.500 --> 43:50.500
- I'm serious!
- Sixty-nine, 69, 69.

43:50.500 --> 43:51.500
shit!

43:56.500 --> 43:57.500
What the fuck?

44:01.500 --> 44:02.500
Conrad, hold on.

44:04.500 --> 44:05.500
Shit.

44:05.500 --> 44:07.500
We've had a breach.

44:07.500 --> 44:08.500
God.

44:08.500 --> 44:10.500
Sixth floor, security room.

44:11.500 --> 44:12.500
What do you mean? Who, who is it?

44:12.500 --> 44:15.500
Who the fuck are you? Huh?

44:16.500 --> 44:17.500
Huh? You SWAT?

44:18.500 --> 44:19.500
Are you SEALs?

44:19.500 --> 44:20.500
Transporters?

44:21.500 --> 44:24.500
Answer me right the fuck now,
or I'll plug you in three seconds.

44:24.500 --> 44:25.500
Uh...

44:29.500 --> 44:30.500
- One...
- No.

44:31.500 --> 44:32.500
Please.

44:33.500 --> 44:35.500
- Two...
- Please.

44:40.500 --> 44:41.500
- No!
- No, no. Wait, wait, wait...

44:42.500 --> 44:43.500
Three!

44:47.500 --> 44:49.500
fuck.

44:49.500 --> 44:51.500
Oh, oh, My God.

44:52.500 --> 44:54.500
I'm a genius! I wiggled us back in.

44:54.500 --> 44:57.500
Whoo!

44:57.500 --> 45:00.500
<i>Donald, kill them
</i> and then enter the code.

45:00.500 --> 45:02.500
<i>You do have the code, right, Donald?</i>

45:02.500 --> 45:03.500
<i>Donald?</i>

45:03.500 --> 45:04.500
Donald?

45:07.500 --> 45:09.500
There's a cop at the lobby door.
We shot him.

45:10.500 --> 45:11.500
But he got away.

45:15.500 --> 45:16.500
Why are you looking at me like that, huh?

45:16.500 --> 45:18.500
You're the sneaky fucks.

45:18.500 --> 45:21.500
The backstabbers,
the betrayers, the Judas...

45:21.500 --> 45:22.500
Judases? Judas?

45:22.500 --> 45:25.500
The one that betrayed Jesus? Judas, right?

45:26.500 --> 45:27.500
Yeah, you're the fucking Judases.

45:27.500 --> 45:29.500
Let's stop with the name-calling, guys.

45:29.500 --> 45:30.500
- Backstabbers.
- Great.

45:30.500 --> 45:32.500
Okay, guys, new rule: always double-check

45:32.500 --> 45:35.500
that dead bad guys
are actually dead bad guys.

45:36.500 --> 45:37.500
Holy shit!

45:37.500 --> 45:39.500
This is a dead bad guy!

45:40.500 --> 45:43.500
I don't know, I feel like my dead bad guy
is way worse than your dead bad guy.

45:43.500 --> 45:45.500
"My dead bad"?
That's not your dead bad guy.

45:45.500 --> 45:47.500
These are just dead bad guys.

45:47.500 --> 45:49.500
Looks like a human-sized
ketchup packet exploded.

45:50.500 --> 45:52.500
- Damn it.
- What?

45:52.500 --> 45:54.500
Computer's busted. I can't get online.

45:54.500 --> 45:56.500
Yeah, he is full-on spaghetti
and meat sauce down here.

45:57.500 --> 46:00.500
- Guys. I found a phone.
- What?

46:02.500 --> 46:03.500
Wait a second.

46:03.500 --> 46:05.500
Why does the dead bad guy
have this dude's number?

46:05.500 --> 46:08.500
- Who?
- What are you, a fucking owl?

46:08.500 --> 46:10.500
Yeah, I would love to be an owl, Darren.

46:10.500 --> 46:13.500
So I could soar off into the night
hella majestically.

46:22.500 --> 46:25.500
Wait, you have a phone?
You have to call for help.

46:26.500 --> 46:28.500
Shh. No.

46:29.500 --> 46:30.500
I think he just screened me.

46:30.500 --> 46:32.500
He screened the dead guy.
Don't take it personally.

46:33.500 --> 46:34.500
Shut up. Voicemail.

46:34.500 --> 46:36.500
this is Darren and Joel.

46:36.500 --> 46:38.500
Yeah, I'm here too, so...

46:38.500 --> 46:41.500
And Alexxx.
The the Dew'd Crew from the roof.

46:41.500 --> 46:42.500
- Remember?
- Say "Skintendo."

46:42.500 --> 46:44.500
We are calling
to find out what's going on.

46:44.500 --> 46:46.500
There's, like...
people shooting and stuff.

46:46.500 --> 46:49.500
Please give me a call back at this number,
uh, when it's a good time for you.

46:49.500 --> 46:50.500
Okay, give me the phone.

46:50.500 --> 46:52.500
- We'll talk then.
- It's not a conference call.

46:52.500 --> 46:54.500
We're not waiting for him to call back.

46:54.500 --> 46:57.500
You didn't even bring up
the two most important things:

46:57.500 --> 47:01.500
the Bey and, I don't know,
how about the fucking check?

47:01.500 --> 47:02.500
- Come on.
- The check.

47:02.500 --> 47:04.500
Mention a dead body. That'd be nice.

47:04.500 --> 47:06.500
Been a while since I've left a voicemail.

47:06.500 --> 47:07.500
I'm gonna call him back, so...

47:07.500 --> 47:09.500
It's rude to just call right back.
You leave a message,

47:10.500 --> 47:11.500
- let them call you back.
- Darren...

47:14.500 --> 47:17.500
Ahmad, you dumb fuck.
You gotta call somebody, yo.

47:17.500 --> 47:20.500
- Fuck the police. Except for right now.
- You're gonna get us killed.

47:20.500 --> 47:23.500
You didn't turn it in.
You're putting everyone's lives at risk.

47:23.500 --> 47:25.500
I'm sorry, is there something
we should be discussing?

47:25.500 --> 47:26.500
No.

47:32.500 --> 47:35.500
Hold up.

47:35.500 --> 47:38.500
Why aren't you taking his phone?

47:38.500 --> 47:40.500
No, I don't see any phone.

47:40.500 --> 47:42.500
Um, you guys just be quiet over here.

47:42.500 --> 47:45.500
Your fucking creepy blue eyes
don't see the phone lighting up

47:45.500 --> 47:46.500
in his pocket right there?

47:46.500 --> 47:49.500
Also, it's making a noise.
It's going, "vuh, voo, vuh."

47:49.500 --> 47:51.500
It's over!

47:52.500 --> 47:54.500
Cut me free. Now!

47:54.500 --> 47:57.500
Wait, wait, wait.
.. this is not my fault.

47:57.500 --> 48:00.500
Erma derailed the entire operation
the moment she got here.

48:00.500 --> 48:02.500
And has anyone noticed her accent?

48:02.500 --> 48:05.500
The German accent? It's fake!
She grew up in Pacoima!

48:05.500 --> 48:07.500
Come on. She's a lunatic!

48:07.500 --> 48:08.500
Is this true, Erma?

48:08.500 --> 48:10.500
Yeah, I'm a lunatic.

48:11.500 --> 48:13.500
No, no, no. No. Give me...

48:13.500 --> 48:15.500
- Give me the gun.
- Gladly. See, told you.

48:15.500 --> 48:17.500
- I mean, what was I supposed to do?
- Right.

48:17.500 --> 48:19.500
Kill her. Like this.

48:30.500 --> 48:32.500
Lovely.

48:32.500 --> 48:35.500
Honestly, did not know
I was gonna do that.

48:35.500 --> 48:37.500
This whole thing was you?

48:37.500 --> 48:38.500
Mm, giving orders the whole time

48:38.500 --> 48:43.500
from the, "dusty-ass BlackBerry"
in my pocket.

48:43.500 --> 48:46.500
Physical keyboards
aren't so stupid now, are they?

48:46.500 --> 48:48.500
Nah, they're still dumb as fuck,

48:48.500 --> 48:52.500
and you still got atrocious-ass halitosis,
but I'm surprised.

48:52.500 --> 48:56.500
Yeah, well, at least my breath
doesn't smell like old-ass hyena pussy.

48:56.500 --> 48:58.500
God.

48:58.500 --> 49:01.500
Adaptarea: Legendofmir youtube.legendofmir.ro

49:01.500 --> 49:05.500
- Hello, Donald, you cheeky sausage.
- What?

49:06.500 --> 49:08.500
No, I think that Donald guy's dead.

49:08.500 --> 49:11.500
He either was sucked out of a window, or he choked on a computer.

49:11.500 --> 49:13.500
So what's going on up there?

49:13.500 --> 49:15.500
- Speakerphone.
- Who is this?

49:15.500 --> 49:17.500
- Speaker.
- I'm going on speakerphone.

49:17.500 --> 49:19.500
- Dew'd Crew here.
- Lumber Jacks.

49:19.500 --> 49:21.500
- What? Hi?
- How's the Bey doing?

49:22.500 --> 49:25.500
Wait, why do you have this guy's number?

49:26.500 --> 49:27.500
Wait, are you a bad guy too?

49:28.500 --> 49:30.500
Well, I suppose so, yes.

49:30.500 --> 49:35.500
But, you have just forced me
to become, unmistakably evil.

49:38.500 --> 49:40.500
fuck.

49:41.500 --> 49:42.500
I'll take the access codes now.

49:43.500 --> 49:44.500
Nah.

49:44.500 --> 49:47.500
Sorry, motherfucker. Can't do it.
That dude? I didn't know him.

49:47.500 --> 49:50.500
Shit, he might've let me live
if I gave him the codes.

49:50.500 --> 49:52.500
But you? Fuck you.

49:52.500 --> 49:54.500
I know if I give you the codes, I'm dead.

49:54.500 --> 49:56.500
And I know why.

49:56.500 --> 49:58.500
'Cause I made you eat that hooker's booty

49:58.500 --> 50:00.500
at my birthday party, isn't it?

50:02.500 --> 50:05.500
This motherfucker ate a hooker's booty.
You had crabs in your teeth for a week.

50:05.500 --> 50:07.500
Remember shoving your face

50:07.500 --> 50:10.500
right up in that crab-infested
booty hole, bro?

50:10.500 --> 50:12.500
'Cause I do, you fucking loser.

50:12.500 --> 50:15.500
You dumb fucking fuck-hole.

50:15.500 --> 50:19.500
- You fucking suck.
- Very well.

50:19.500 --> 50:21.500
I'll acquire my compensation another way.

50:21.500 --> 50:24.500
And while I wait to get paid, I'll...

50:24.500 --> 50:26.500
torture you. And kill you.

50:26.500 --> 50:30.500
Erma! We are sending a video
to the United States government.

50:30.500 --> 50:34.500
Also, bring me Shaggy.

50:34.500 --> 50:36.500
What the hell's going on?

50:36.500 --> 50:39.500
The fucking butler?

50:41.500 --> 50:43.500
guys, check it out.

50:47.500 --> 50:48.500
Whoa.

50:48.500 --> 50:50.500
Pigs brought the whole farm.

50:51.500 --> 50:53.500
- Yeah.
- Turn on the news.

50:53.500 --> 50:54.500
Turn on the news.

50:55.500 --> 50:57.500
Okay.

50:58.500 --> 51:00.500
Steve-O!

51:00.500 --> 51:01.500
- There, there, there.
- Steve-O!

51:02.500 --> 51:03.500
<i>Give me that mic. Give me that mic!</i>

51:03.500 --> 51:06.500
<i>Steve-O, if you can hear me
in the spirit world...</i>

51:06.500 --> 51:08.500
...I love you, brother.

51:08.500 --> 51:10.500
<i>It should've been you!
It should've been you.</i>

51:10.500 --> 51:13.500
<i>you. And </i> Channel 8.

51:14.500 --> 51:16.500
<i>Uh, okay, I'm, I'm just being told
we've received a video</i>

51:17.500 --> 51:18.500
<i>from the terrorists.</i>

51:18.500 --> 51:22.500
<i>Warning: what you're about to see
may not be suitable for younger viewers.</i>

51:22.500 --> 51:24.500
<i>Good evening.</i>

51:24.500 --> 51:28.500
<i>As you probably know, I've taken control
of the Level Hotel, Los Angeles.</i>

51:28.500 --> 51:30.500
<i>I had intentions of only taking money</i>

51:30.500 --> 51:33.500
<i>from a disrespectful
and arrogant billionaire child...</i>

51:34.500 --> 51:37.500
<i>but that was derailed
by some idiotic waiters.</i>

51:38.500 --> 51:40.500
Are we the idiotics?

51:40.500 --> 51:41.500
No, stupid. We're maids.

51:41.500 --> 51:46.500
<i>So now I'm holding 106 hostages
until I receive $500 million</i>

51:46.500 --> 51:49.500
<i>and a helicopter,
which I will fly out of the U.S.</i>

51:49.500 --> 51:53.500
<i>and release, the remaining hostages.</i>

51:53.500 --> 51:57.500
<i>I should add: any breach
of this building will trigger...</i>

51:58.500 --> 52:00.500
<i>an explosive collar,</i>

52:00.500 --> 52:02.500
<i>creating a mess no one wants to clean up.</i>

52:02.500 --> 52:06.500
<i>Additionally, I will kill one hostage
every 15 minutes</i>

52:06.500 --> 52:10.500
<i>to ensure prompt payment, starting, now.</i>

52:11.500 --> 52:13.500
shit. That's hot.

52:13.500 --> 52:16.500
<i>Bro, listen, man, listen.
We brothers. We brothers.</i>

52:16.500 --> 52:18.500
<i>We're supposed to be brothers, man!</i>

52:19.500 --> 52:22.500
<i>I could get you Stacey Dash's number.</i>

52:22.500 --> 52:24.500
shit!

52:24.500 --> 52:26.500
No, no, no, no. What?

52:26.500 --> 52:29.500
<i>As you can see,
</i> I'm holding up my end of the bargain.

52:29.500 --> 52:30.500
<i>I hope you do the same.</i>

52:30.500 --> 52:34.500
<i>And now, on a lighter note,
another must-see TV moment:</i>

52:34.500 --> 52:37.500
<i>a very chill performance, by Shaggy.</i>

52:39.500 --> 52:42.500
<i>- Yeah, uh...
- Don't kill Shaggy. I fuckin' love Shaggy.</i>

52:42.500 --> 52:44.500
- What is happening?
- Don't kill Shaggy. Don't kill Shaggy.

52:44.500 --> 52:49.500
<i>I wanna do this song that I wrote
for the earthquake victims of Haiti.</i>

52:49.500 --> 52:50.500
- <i>Sing "It Wasn't Me"!
</i>-Uh...

52:51.500 --> 52:53.500
<i>Dude, that's not really appropriate
for, for what...</i>

52:54.500 --> 52:56.500
<i>No one wants to hear
</i> that Haiti shit!

52:56.500 --> 52:58.500
<i>Okay? They want "It Wasn't Me."
I want "It Wasn't Me."</i>

52:58.500 --> 52:59.500
<i>Sing "It Wasn't Me."</i>

52:59.500 --> 53:01.500
- Sing it!
- Shaggy, please!

53:01.500 --> 53:02.500
Sing it, Shaggy!

53:03.500 --> 53:06.500
<i>* H-honey came in
</i> And she caught me red-handed *

53:06.500 --> 53:09.500
<i>* Creeping with the girl next door *</i>

53:09.500 --> 53:11.500
<i>* Picture this, we were both butt-naked *</i>

53:11.500 --> 53:13.500
<i>* Bangin' on the bathroom floor *</i>

53:13.500 --> 53:19.500
<i>* How could I forget
That I have given her an extra key? *</i>

53:19.500 --> 53:22.500
<i>* All this time, she was standing there *</i>

53:22.500 --> 53:24.500
<i>* She never took her eyes off me *</i>

53:25.500 --> 53:27.500
<i>* How ya fi give the woman
</i> Access to your villa? *

53:27.500 --> 53:31.500
<i>Shaggy goes on to finish the song
and is unharmed, as far as we know.</i>

53:31.500 --> 53:34.500
Round everybody up! We're going inside.

53:34.500 --> 53:37.500
Shag, too soon, but I'm out.

53:37.500 --> 53:40.500
Yeah, yo, by all means.

53:40.500 --> 53:42.500
What's the nearest room
that can accommodate us?

53:42.500 --> 53:44.500
Uh, the conference room.

53:44.500 --> 53:47.500
But, ooh, it's dressed
for a convention tomorrow,

53:47.500 --> 53:50.500
so if you don't mind, I would appreciate
if we just stayed upstairs,

53:50.500 --> 53:51.500
not to mess it up.

53:51.500 --> 53:53.500
- Take everyone to the conference room!
- Okay.

53:53.500 --> 53:54.500
Come on, let's move.

53:54.500 --> 53:58.500
I don't herd cattle.
I'll be hunting waiters.

53:58.500 --> 54:00.500
Bilbo, Dildo, you come with me.

54:01.500 --> 54:05.500
You don't ask for respect, little girl.
You take it.

54:08.500 --> 54:10.500
Move it, ladies.
You got legs. Use 'em.

54:10.500 --> 54:12.500
- Move it, people.
- What the fuck is the holdup?

54:12.500 --> 54:15.500
- Everybody out.
- Keep moving! Let's go!

54:15.500 --> 54:17.500
Come on!

54:21.500 --> 54:22.500
Darren, look.

54:24.500 --> 54:25.500
They're going inside.

54:25.500 --> 54:26.500
So what?

54:26.500 --> 54:28.500
So they're contained.

54:28.500 --> 54:31.500
You can't contain machine guns, Darren.

54:31.500 --> 54:33.500
How much salvia did you smoke?

54:34.500 --> 54:36.500
Shit, how much more do you have of that?

54:36.500 --> 54:39.500
I mean, there's a lot here,
but it is covered in glass.

54:39.500 --> 54:42.500
Not the sandwich, your salvia. How much?

54:42.500 --> 54:44.500
so now you want my help.

54:45.500 --> 54:46.500
Hmm, sure.

54:46.500 --> 54:48.500
Grab those guns and follow moi.

54:57.500 --> 55:00.500
You got glass.
You got glass in your hair.

55:04.500 --> 55:07.500
I'm flippin' keys.

55:07.500 --> 55:11.500
Well, not yet, actually.
I've got some serious rebranding to do.

55:11.500 --> 55:15.500
Turns out salvia isn't a very sexy drug
and no one likes it except for Darren...

55:15.500 --> 55:17.500
and, weirdly, the JV softball team.

55:17.500 --> 55:20.500
- Those girls get fuckin' wild.
- Okay, yeah, whatever, man.

55:20.500 --> 55:22.500
- This is perfect. This is great.
- Okay.

55:24.500 --> 55:27.500
Alexxx? Do you live here?

55:27.500 --> 55:29.500
Because it looks like you live here.

55:29.500 --> 55:32.500
I don't live here.
No, you know who I think lives here?

55:32.500 --> 55:33.500
Josu?Š.

55:33.500 --> 55:36.500
Yeah, the maintenance guy?
That guy's, that guy's a weirdo.

55:37.500 --> 55:39.500
Yeah, like I was saying
about the rebranding...

55:39.500 --> 55:43.500
um, you know, like the Marlboro man,
but this is "Uncle Sal."

55:43.500 --> 55:45.500
Sal-via? Get it?

55:46.500 --> 55:49.500
Dude, there's, like, a "Buffalo Bill went
to Costco" amount of lotion over here.

55:49.500 --> 55:52.500
- The salvia's back here, so...
- Yeah, yeah.

55:53.500 --> 55:55.500
And what is this?

55:55.500 --> 55:59.500
This is an oil painting of you on a throne with money hanging out of your pockets

55:59.500 --> 56:02.500
and a bunch of tits hovering around your head.

56:02.500 --> 56:06.500
Seems like he, he's a true artist for real, but that is weird, admittedly.

56:06.500 --> 56:08.500
- Salvia is this way, so...
- Yeah, okay.

56:08.500 --> 56:10.500
So Josu?Š is up here painting you and...

56:11.500 --> 56:15.500
beating off to a porno parody of your favorite childhood movie, Flubber?

56:15.500 --> 56:19.500
<i>"Flubbher." That's funny.</i>

56:22.500 --> 56:26.500
Fine! Yes, I live here, okay?
I jerk off up here. I paint myself here.

56:26.500 --> 56:28.500
I jerk off while painting myself.
Is that what you wanted to hear?

56:28.500 --> 56:30.500
- Jesus Christ.
- This isn't that bad.

56:30.500 --> 56:33.500
I'm saving up all the money, so I'm gonna buy a Maybach in like six years.

56:33.500 --> 56:38.500
I'm an adult homeless man stuck in a balling-ass body, but I put my pride aside

56:38.500 --> 56:40.500
and took you to my grow house to save the fucking day.

56:40.500 --> 56:43.500
- So you're welcome.
- Well, it's a grow closet at best,

56:43.500 --> 56:46.500
but it's definitely enough salvia to hotbox the whole conference room.

56:46.500 --> 56:49.500
I mean, we can knock them on their asses, take their weapons, lock them in.

56:49.500 --> 56:51.500
- We could kill 'em.
- No, not kill them.

56:52.500 --> 56:53.500
What do you mean?
You guys already got a kill.

56:54.500 --> 56:57.500
I haven't gotten a kill yet, so it's, it's kind of fair that I'd get one.

56:57.500 --> 56:58.500
You can have my kill.

56:58.500 --> 57:00.500
I don't want your kill. I want my own.

57:00.500 --> 57:02.500
Look, I like this plan.

57:02.500 --> 57:06.500
Cool, good. We gotta figure out how to get the smoke into the conference room.

57:06.500 --> 57:08.500
I'm thinking the maintenance breezeway.
The vents there?

57:08.500 --> 57:09.500
If we can go in the ducts...

57:09.500 --> 57:11.500
No, I don't, I can't.

57:11.500 --> 57:13.500
Figure it out. Look at all this.

57:13.500 --> 57:16.500
- Build something, man.
- I mean, there's a ton of lotion.

57:17.500 --> 57:19.500
What, we should just jerk the goons off into submission?

57:19.500 --> 57:21.500
Just build something, man!

57:21.500 --> 57:23.500
This is a trash heap.
There's nothing I can use here.

57:23.500 --> 57:25.500
Yeah, this is all my belongings, so...

57:27.500 --> 57:28.500
Hold on.

57:28.500 --> 57:31.500
I got it. I got it! I'll draw it up so you know what I'm talking about.

57:32.500 --> 57:34.500
The wheels are turning!

57:34.500 --> 57:36.500
All right. So what do I get to do?

57:36.500 --> 57:38.500
You? Nothing.

57:38.500 --> 57:40.500
You just stay out of the way.
Okay? You've done enough.

57:43.500 --> 57:45.500
On your feet!

57:45.500 --> 57:46.500
On your feet now!

57:49.500 --> 57:50.500
- Tough guy.
- Shut up.

57:52.500 --> 57:53.500
- Shut up!
- Yeah, you smell bad.

57:53.500 --> 57:56.500
What, did you shit in your pants?

57:56.500 --> 57:57.500
Shit.

57:57.500 --> 57:59.500
Wow, wow. You think I'm scared of you

57:59.500 --> 58:02.500
'cause you got a gun in my face? Fuck off.

58:02.500 --> 58:04.500
Bet you think you're gonna buy respect

58:04.500 --> 58:06.500
with all that money too, huh?

58:06.500 --> 58:08.500
Well, it bought you respect.

58:08.500 --> 58:11.500
What, you think these people like you
because they follow you online?

58:12.500 --> 58:14.500
You know, half his followers are bots.

58:14.500 --> 58:16.500
Okay? He's not as famous as you think.

58:16.500 --> 58:19.500
Yo, point is, I blow their fucking minds.

58:19.500 --> 58:21.500
All you do is hate and take.

58:23.500 --> 58:27.500
Well, um, why don't we...

58:27.500 --> 58:29.500
"blow their minds" now?

58:32.500 --> 58:34.500
You there. Bring him over here.

58:34.500 --> 58:36.500
I didn't do anything. What's going on?

58:37.500 --> 58:40.500
no, no. Jesus, oh, God.

58:40.500 --> 58:41.500
Please don't hurt me.

58:41.500 --> 58:44.500
My intentions are to do
quite the opposite.

58:45.500 --> 58:47.500
Strip his pants. Bend him over the table.

58:47.500 --> 58:50.500
No. What the fuck?

58:50.500 --> 58:51.500
What...? No.

58:53.500 --> 58:54.500
Jesus.

58:55.500 --> 58:56.500
Let me up.

58:57.500 --> 58:58.500
You made me eat that...

59:00.500 --> 59:03.500
...hooker ass.

59:04.500 --> 59:05.500
Yeah.

59:06.500 --> 59:09.500
Now let's see you muster any respect

59:09.500 --> 59:13.500
after you toss this fat fuck's salad.

59:13.500 --> 59:15.500
Ahmad! Ahmad.

59:16.500 --> 59:18.500
It's so dark.

59:18.500 --> 59:20.500
Do it, or he's a dead man.

59:21.500 --> 59:23.500
All right, I just wanna say one thing, dog.

59:24.500 --> 59:25.500
Didn't have to be this way.

59:34.500 --> 59:35.500
Stop...

59:36.500 --> 59:40.500
What the fuck? what the fuck?

59:40.500 --> 59:44.500
- Yeah.
- Ooh. Wait, wait, okay.

59:44.500 --> 59:46.500
Whoa. Are you guys seeing this?

59:46.500 --> 59:49.500
Do you see this? Bey's eating my ass.

59:49.500 --> 59:53.500
I'm getting my salad tossed by Bey!

59:53.500 --> 59:54.500
Someone 'Gram this!

59:54.500 --> 59:57.500
- Right, enough...
- I'm not done, motherfucker!

01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:02.500
All right, stop it! Get him up. Up.
Enough, enough!

01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:04.500
Just a little bit longer.

01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:06.500
What happened?

01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:07.500
You tried to embarrass me?

01:00:08.500 --> 01:00:09.500
I done fucked 10,500 women.

01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:12.500
You don't think I ate a grip
of dude-booties along the way?

01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:14.500
Yeah-yeah!

01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:17.500
You may not be able
to feel embarrassment. I get it.

01:00:18.500 --> 01:00:20.500
But prepare to feel suffering.

01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:25.500
Let's try this again.

01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:29.500
Bring me the correct
corresponding breach sensor.

01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:38.500
I-I hope he can swim.
Ah!

01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:40.500
- What...
- oh, oh.

01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:42.500
- What the fuck, man?
- Squat.

01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:44.500
Okay.

01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:46.500
These. We know what these do.

01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:48.500
- No. Ahmad, Ahmad...
- Yeah.

01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:52.500
oh.
is that, yeah.

01:00:58.500 --> 01:00:59.500
Lower.

01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:00.500
Lower.

01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:02.500
Perfect.

01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:05.500
Fuck, they got Chet!

01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:09.500
How the fuck is that possible?
They're fuckin' waiters.

01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:14.500
Weren't you just

01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:18.500
a fucking garbageman a few years ago?

01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:25.500
This way.

01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:30.500
I don't really appreciate you putting
my r?Šsum?Š in the street like that.

01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:31.500
Tell me you were driving

01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:33.500
- the fucking truck.
- Fuck you, man.

01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:42.500
- That should do it.
- Good.

01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:44.500
All right, so we patch into the air duct.

01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:46.500
We hit the switch. We wait 30, 45 seconds.

01:01:46.500 --> 01:01:49.500
Until the bad guys pass out.
We zip tie them, take their guns,

01:01:49.500 --> 01:01:51.500
and free the hostages.
I know. It's my plan.

01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:54.500
Okay, cool. You can have a sticker
or something.

01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:55.500
- What are you doing? Come on.
- Sorry.

01:01:56.500 --> 01:01:58.500
All right, pick a gun.

01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:00.500
No, no. I am not using a gun.

01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:03.500
All right? My brain is my weapon.

01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:05.500
And it is fully loaded, sir.

01:02:05.500 --> 01:02:07.500
Okay, fine. Then you wheel the cart.

01:02:07.500 --> 01:02:10.500
What did I say?
Please don't do that, okay? Just...

01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:12.500
grab the extension cord.

01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:14.500
Let's go.

01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:40.500
- You feeling tired yet?
- Fuck you.

01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:42.500
You're like the worst Bond villain ever.

01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:44.500
You might as well just kill me, 'cause...

01:02:44.500 --> 01:02:47.500
...I ain't gettin' tired.

01:02:47.500 --> 01:02:50.500
Well, Lil Puma
looks kind of tuckered out.

01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:52.500
Maybe we should put him out of his misery.

01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:26.500
Wowee!

01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:29.500
Now, that, that was fun. God.

01:03:29.500 --> 01:03:30.500
Take respect.

01:03:30.500 --> 01:03:31.500
- Don't ask.
- Yeah!

01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:33.500
- Take.
-

01:03:33.500 --> 01:03:35.500
Did you see all the fuckin' blood
in that water?

01:03:35.500 --> 01:03:39.500
How much blood was in that dog?
It's like a fuckin' bloodhound!

01:03:39.500 --> 01:03:40.500
All right, mister!

01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:44.500
I think we have all had just about enough!
Right?

01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:47.500
Your treatment of our hotel guest
is unacceptable,

01:03:47.500 --> 01:03:51.500
not to mention your complete
and utter disregard for hotel property!

01:03:51.500 --> 01:03:53.500
And you killed the little rat puppy!

01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:57.500
As acting manager of the Level Hotel,
I am telling you,

01:03:57.500 --> 01:03:58.500
this ends now!

01:03:58.500 --> 01:04:01.500
God.

01:04:03.500 --> 01:04:05.500
Just, There you are.

01:04:05.500 --> 01:04:06.500
That's better.

01:04:08.500 --> 01:04:09.500
Look at the time.

01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:13.500
It appears the U.S. government
doesn't care about you.

01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:20.500
In 60 seconds, someone will die. But I think I'm done with killing.

01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:24.500
For a little while, at least...

01:04:26.500 --> 01:04:28.500
Don't talk.

01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:31.500
- You.
- Shit.

01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:34.500
- No. Babe.
- Do something. Volunteer as tribute.

01:04:34.500 --> 01:04:36.500
- Do something!
- Up.

01:04:36.500 --> 01:04:39.500
Do something! God. Okay. And...

01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:43.500
No way. You.

01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:44.500
Cut them free, please.

01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:45.500
Step forward.

01:04:53.500 --> 01:04:59.500
- Now, fight to the death.
- What? No.

01:04:59.500 --> 01:05:05.500
I'm sending this, to the news next.

01:05:05.500 --> 01:05:07.500
- Look, I'm not killing her.
- Okay.

01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:10.500
One of you kill the other, or I shoot you both.

01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:17.500
<i>Look, anybody who can see this, I don't wanna do this! I am not a murderer!</i>

01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:19.500
You got that right!

01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:22.500
- Christ.
- Shit, I killed him.

01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:24.500
<i>J-Joel...</i>

01:05:24.500 --> 01:05:27.500
<i>Now, that's what I call television. But let's not do it again.</i>

01:05:27.500 --> 01:05:30.500
<i>Bring me my money, my helicopter.</i>

01:05:30.500 --> 01:05:33.500
- Did they put the money together yet?
- Just now.

01:05:33.500 --> 01:05:37.500
- Tell 'em to get the chopper up now.
- Yes, sir.

01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:40.500
Dude. Keep it down.

01:05:49.500 --> 01:05:52.500
Hurry the fuck up.

01:05:52.500 --> 01:05:56.500
Okay, do you want me to be fast or quiet?
'Cause that guy's about to kill somebody.

01:05:56.500 --> 01:05:58.500
Come on, go, go, go.

01:06:07.500 --> 01:06:08.500
Come on, come on, move it.

01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:28.500
It was just working.

01:06:28.500 --> 01:06:29.500
You're gonna die so fast compared to me.

01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:31.500
Okay. It's ready.

01:06:31.500 --> 01:06:34.500
- I got the torch. Need a lighter.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Here.

01:06:34.500 --> 01:06:36.500
Okay, just hand it to me. All right.

01:06:36.500 --> 01:06:37.500
And plug in the fan.

01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:40.500
- Hurry!
- I'm going to. Where's the extension cord?

01:06:41.500 --> 01:06:42.500
was I supposed to bring that?

01:06:42.500 --> 01:06:44.500
Yeah, I said bring it.

01:06:45.500 --> 01:06:48.500
Yeah, well, you also said
you didn't need my help.

01:06:49.500 --> 01:06:51.500
Then you cut me out of the Skintendo.

01:06:51.500 --> 01:06:54.500
So, I don't know,
I guess I was just a little confused.

01:06:56.500 --> 01:06:59.500
- Alexxx, no.
- Dude.

01:06:59.500 --> 01:07:01.500
Please do not be a complete piece of shit

01:07:01.500 --> 01:07:03.500
and tell me you brought
that extension cord.

01:07:03.500 --> 01:07:04.500
Mm-mm-mm.

01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:08.500
You're playing games because we wouldn't let you be in charge?

01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:10.500
Dude, those people are counting on us.

01:07:10.500 --> 01:07:13.500
Forget it. It's fine. Just, you're gonna have to build a longer tube,

01:07:13.500 --> 01:07:14.500
some kind of conduit.

01:07:14.500 --> 01:07:17.500
Just get some more fucking grocery bags or...

01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:19.500
No, no, no. Fuck you.

01:07:19.500 --> 01:07:22.500
You are so fucking selfish, it's disgusting.

01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:28.500
I'm serious when I say this, as maybe a friend, but you better, watch your back.

01:07:28.500 --> 01:07:30.500
Dude, you watch your back.

01:07:30.500 --> 01:07:31.500
- No, dude, behind you!
- Watch your back!

01:07:36.500 --> 01:07:37.500
Fuck!

01:07:37.500 --> 01:07:39.500
Don't shoot them, you idiot.

01:07:39.500 --> 01:07:40.500
They're mine.

01:07:41.500 --> 01:07:43.500
Damn it.

01:07:56.500 --> 01:07:57.500
Well, well.

01:07:59.500 --> 01:08:02.500
Looks like Little Miss Tough Girl
ain't so tough anymore, is she?

01:08:03.500 --> 01:08:06.500
We gonna have some fun.

01:08:10.500 --> 01:08:12.500
- Split up!
- Split up!

01:08:14.500 --> 01:08:16.500
Shit! Go this way!

01:08:20.500 --> 01:08:21.500
- No!
- shit!

01:08:21.500 --> 01:08:22.500
What are you doing? Split up!

01:08:22.500 --> 01:08:24.500
- Yeah, we did!
- I meant all of us.

01:08:25.500 --> 01:08:28.500
I need a minute, man.
I got to take a little trip somewhere.

01:08:29.500 --> 01:08:31.500
What? fuck no.

01:08:31.500 --> 01:08:34.500
You're gonna smoke salvia
while we're being hunted by murderers?

01:08:34.500 --> 01:08:35.500
That's right. Know why?

01:08:35.500 --> 01:08:37.500
'Cause I don't wanna know
I'm being hunted by murderers.

01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:40.500
yeah, suck it down, you fuckin' sicko.

01:08:44.500 --> 01:08:45.500
What about Alexxx, man?
We got to find him.

01:08:47.500 --> 01:08:49.500
Shit!

01:09:08.500 --> 01:09:10.500
Get ready to be my first kill!

01:09:10.500 --> 01:09:13.500
Yeah? Be prepared to be my millionth.

01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:17.500
Yeah, right!

01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:19.500
If you'd said nine or ten,

01:09:19.500 --> 01:09:21.500
I'd be like, "This guy's a murderer,"
but a million?

01:09:21.500 --> 01:09:24.500
It's way too many! That's too many murders!

01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:25.500
No!

01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:42.500
No!

01:09:54.500 --> 01:09:56.500
God!

01:09:57.500 --> 01:10:01.500
I'm gonna fucking kill you, you son of a bitch.

01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:05.500
My bad.

01:10:06.500 --> 01:10:09.500
I'm so sorry!

01:10:09.500 --> 01:10:14.500
I'm sorry! I don't want to!

01:10:14.500 --> 01:10:18.500
Fuck you!

01:10:30.500 --> 01:10:33.500
Follow me.

01:10:40.500 --> 01:10:44.500
Great. Back in El Jizzblaster's room.

01:10:44.500 --> 01:10:47.500
- So what now?
- Nothing.

01:10:47.500 --> 01:10:49.500
Okay? We're done.

01:10:49.500 --> 01:10:52.500
You ruined our best shot at ending all this.

01:10:52.500 --> 01:10:54.500
Fuck you!

01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:57.500
Okay, good. You're fired up.

01:10:57.500 --> 01:11:00.500
So I won't take that personally.
Now let's use that energy...

01:11:00.500 --> 01:11:01.500
Alexxx, take it personally.

01:11:01.500 --> 01:11:04.500
We're done following you around for good.

01:11:08.500 --> 01:11:12.500
Whatever. You guys are doing A-okay without me, right?

01:11:12.500 --> 01:11:15.500
Working in secret on the Skintendo Joysuit?

01:11:15.500 --> 01:11:18.500
- How long has that been going on?
- Jesus Christ. Years.

01:11:18.500 --> 01:11:21.500
I can't believe I followed a loser like you around for years.

01:11:21.500 --> 01:11:23.500
I'm not a loser!

01:11:24.500 --> 01:11:26.500
No!

01:11:28.500 --> 01:11:29.500
You just shot at me?

01:11:29.500 --> 01:11:31.500
I shot near you, bitch.

01:11:32.500 --> 01:11:33.500
Okay.

01:11:35.500 --> 01:11:36.500
Me too, then.

01:11:39.500 --> 01:11:40.500
You son of a...

01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:45.500
Guys! Stop.

01:11:46.500 --> 01:11:47.500
Shut up, Baby Dunc.

01:11:47.500 --> 01:11:50.500
My name is Joel, you idiots!

01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:56.500
shit!

01:12:09.500 --> 01:12:11.500
I wish this were fucking loaded, dude,

01:12:11.500 --> 01:12:14.500
'cause then I would put it there
right through your skull!

01:12:14.500 --> 01:12:16.500
Well, if this was loaded,
I'd come sideways on you like ka-kow.

01:12:16.500 --> 01:12:19.500
Really? 'Cause it'd come out
the other side, and I'd just suture it up.

01:12:19.500 --> 01:12:21.500
okay, well, then my gun
has a bayonet on it,

01:12:21.500 --> 01:12:22.500
and I'd, ugh, un-suture your face!

01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:24.500
really?
Guess what. I got more sutures.

01:12:24.500 --> 01:12:27.500
- Suture, suture, suture.
- What, motherfucker? You spell "suture"!

01:12:27.500 --> 01:12:28.500
You spell "suture"!

01:12:29.500 --> 01:12:30.500
I'm doing this too.

01:12:32.500 --> 01:12:35.500
I wish this were fuckin' loaded, dude.

01:12:38.500 --> 01:12:39.500
This is loaded.

01:12:42.500 --> 01:12:44.500
Rich to Mr. Ahmad. I found those waiters.

01:12:44.500 --> 01:12:45.500
We're housekeepers.

01:12:45.500 --> 01:12:49.500
<i>Perfect timing. Bring them to
</i> the conference room. I'll kill them next.

01:12:49.500 --> 01:12:51.500
Too late. They're already dead.

01:12:52.500 --> 01:12:53.500
good.

01:12:53.500 --> 01:12:55.500
Erma got them?

01:12:55.500 --> 01:12:58.500
No, me. I'll be up in five.

01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:02.500
Mr. Ahmad. There's a chopper approaching.

01:13:04.500 --> 01:13:06.500
You guys look exhausted.

01:13:07.500 --> 01:13:08.500
Let's hit the spa.

01:13:09.500 --> 01:13:11.500
Move!

01:13:13.500 --> 01:13:16.500
I've been waiting for these pics
for a long-ass time now.

01:13:19.500 --> 01:13:20.500
Yo, the guys are gonna love this.

01:13:20.500 --> 01:13:22.500
You look motherfucking insane.

01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:26.500
Come on, that shit is funny. I know
you got a big-ass dick on your face,

01:13:26.500 --> 01:13:28.500
but hey, poo-poo head?

01:13:28.500 --> 01:13:29.500
- That's some funny shit right...
- Mm-mm.

01:13:31.500 --> 01:13:32.500
I thought that shit was funny.

01:13:38.500 --> 01:13:40.500
Okay, okay, okay.
You hate America.

01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:42.500
Man, I get that.

01:13:42.500 --> 01:13:43.500
Slavery, drones,

01:13:44.500 --> 01:13:46.500
they just discontinued
the KFC Double Down out of nowhere,

01:13:46.500 --> 01:13:48.500
but, like, come on, man, we're good guys.

01:13:51.500 --> 01:13:53.500
I'm here for the money.

01:13:53.500 --> 01:13:56.500
And after this job, Jared and I
were finally gonna get away from it all.

01:13:56.500 --> 01:13:58.500
Is that the the guy upstairs?

01:13:59.500 --> 01:14:01.500
- Yeah, it's the guy upstairs.
- What is that?

01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:02.500
What is that?

01:14:04.500 --> 01:14:06.500
You don't know what it's like
to lose someone like that.

01:14:07.500 --> 01:14:08.500
I do.

01:14:08.500 --> 01:14:09.500
I pushed them away myself.

01:14:10.500 --> 01:14:13.500
fuck.

01:14:15.500 --> 01:14:17.500
Don't fuck with me, asshole.

01:14:18.500 --> 01:14:19.500
I'm just getting started.

01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:24.500
Now, you know what?
Let's relax a little bit.

01:14:24.500 --> 01:14:25.500
Let's turn these off.

01:14:26.500 --> 01:14:27.500
There you go.

01:14:28.500 --> 01:14:29.500
Now...

01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:32.500
What's next on your spa menu...

01:14:34.500 --> 01:14:36.500
Have you guys ever had...

01:14:37.500 --> 01:14:39.500
a lava stone massage?

01:14:39.500 --> 01:14:40.500
No.

01:14:40.500 --> 01:14:41.500
We're maids, man.

01:14:41.500 --> 01:14:43.500
We can't even afford a lava lamp.

01:14:43.500 --> 01:14:46.500
they're fabulous.

01:14:50.500 --> 01:14:53.500
this is gonna feel so good.

01:14:53.500 --> 01:14:56.500
For me.
It's gonna really, really hurt you.

01:14:56.500 --> 01:14:58.500
No. No, no, no!

01:14:58.500 --> 01:15:00.500
- yeah!
- Fuck!

01:15:01.500 --> 01:15:02.500
Let's get out those knots!

01:15:03.500 --> 01:15:06.500
- Stop it! Just stop! Stop doing it.
- Stop!

01:15:06.500 --> 01:15:08.500
Please. We're sorry
we killed your friend, seriously.

01:15:09.500 --> 01:15:10.500
My what?

01:15:11.500 --> 01:15:13.500
- My what?
- Your friend.

01:15:13.500 --> 01:15:15.500
My friend?

01:15:15.500 --> 01:15:18.500
- You sound like my dad!
- Okay.

01:15:18.500 --> 01:15:19.500
He wasn't my friend!

01:15:19.500 --> 01:15:21.500
He was my everything!

01:15:21.500 --> 01:15:22.500
Ow!

01:15:22.500 --> 01:15:24.500
fuckface!

01:15:24.500 --> 01:15:28.500
- Alexxx, stop. What are you doing?
- No, no, no, no. Fuck this crybaby.

01:15:28.500 --> 01:15:31.500
why you being
such a fucking cwybaby?

01:15:31.500 --> 01:15:32.500
"my lover's dead."

01:15:33.500 --> 01:15:34.500
You know what you should do?

01:15:35.500 --> 01:15:37.500
Take your own dick,
shove it up your own butt,

01:15:37.500 --> 01:15:39.500
impregnate it, have a butt baby.

01:15:40.500 --> 01:15:42.500
You know what I'd call him?

01:15:42.500 --> 01:15:43.500
Jared Jr.

01:15:43.500 --> 01:15:45.500
- fuck you.
- Fuck you.

01:15:45.500 --> 01:15:47.500
You just earned yourself a deep tissue.

01:15:47.500 --> 01:15:49.500
This guy and the fucking puns, am I right?

01:15:54.500 --> 01:15:55.500
My God.

01:15:58.500 --> 01:16:04.500
* <i>You fucked up
</i> You fucking Nazi whore *

01:16:07.500 --> 01:16:08.500
* Well, you dicked me over *

01:16:08.500 --> 01:16:09.500
Alexxx, look.

01:16:11.500 --> 01:16:12.500
* You fucked up *

01:16:18.500 --> 01:16:22.500
* <i>...you bitch
</i> You really fucked up *

01:16:32.500 --> 01:16:34.500
Ohh!

01:16:35.500 --> 01:16:36.500
Am I dead?

01:16:36.500 --> 01:16:38.500
Is he dead?

01:16:41.500 --> 01:16:42.500
Ew.

01:16:43.500 --> 01:16:45.500
This dude definitely
just shit himself, didn't he?

01:16:46.500 --> 01:16:47.500
Yeah.

01:16:47.500 --> 01:16:50.500
That was a really good idea
about the oil spill.

01:16:50.500 --> 01:16:54.500
Yeah, thanks. I wasn't sure
what your plan was, but yeah.

01:16:54.500 --> 01:16:58.500
Yeah, I didn't really have a plan, per se.

01:16:58.500 --> 01:17:00.500
I mean, it is me, after all, so...

01:17:04.500 --> 01:17:07.500
I just wanted to do something selfless
for you guys for once.

01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:09.500
Yeah.

01:17:11.500 --> 01:17:13.500
And that's what you bring
to the table, man.

01:17:14.500 --> 01:17:18.500
When we're ready to just lay down and die,
you step up.

01:17:20.500 --> 01:17:23.500
I would cry if it wasn't such
a bitch-ass thing to do.

01:17:23.500 --> 01:17:24.500
So I'm not going to.

01:17:24.500 --> 01:17:26.500
- Don't cry.
- Do not cry.

01:17:27.500 --> 01:17:28.500
Got this.

01:17:29.500 --> 01:17:31.500
But I will let you guys know...

01:17:31.500 --> 01:17:33.500
that I fucking love you, dog.

01:17:33.500 --> 01:17:36.500
- I really love you.
- Darren, I fucking love you.

01:17:37.500 --> 01:17:38.500
Count me in.

01:17:41.500 --> 01:17:42.500
What's up?

01:17:43.500 --> 01:17:46.500
- And also with you.
- Take it, just take it.

01:17:46.500 --> 01:17:50.500
That's fine. I'm okay with you repressing
your emotions for now,

01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:53.500
because I understand
the type of upbringing that you've had.

01:17:54.500 --> 01:17:57.500
And just know
that if we make it out of here alive,

01:17:57.500 --> 01:17:59.500
I wanna see those upgrades.

01:17:59.500 --> 01:18:01.500
I wanna be that dude that...

01:18:02.500 --> 01:18:03.500
...that helps you guys
get your ideas made.

01:18:04.500 --> 01:18:06.500
I wanna be the fertilizer. I am the shit.

01:18:06.500 --> 01:18:09.500
And you guys are the little idea seeds
that are gonna be planted within me,

01:18:10.500 --> 01:18:11.500
and we are gonna blossom...

01:18:11.500 --> 01:18:14.500
...and make a little Skintendo flower.

01:18:19.500 --> 01:18:20.500
You know what?

01:18:20.500 --> 01:18:22.500
Let's build Skintendo right now.

01:18:23.500 --> 01:18:25.500
Don't know what I said.
I sort of was just talking.

01:18:25.500 --> 01:18:27.500
Let's do it. Tonight.

01:18:27.500 --> 01:18:28.500
But why? For what?

01:18:29.500 --> 01:18:31.500
To kill bad guys.

01:18:31.500 --> 01:18:33.500
- Fuck yes.
- So what do you say?

01:18:33.500 --> 01:18:35.500
Baby Dunc, you ready?

01:18:35.500 --> 01:18:36.500
Sorry.

01:18:37.500 --> 01:18:38.500
Joel.

01:18:38.500 --> 01:18:41.500
- You up for this?
- Yeah.

01:18:41.500 --> 01:18:42.500
I can make it happen.

01:18:46.500 --> 01:18:47.500
And I think I know how.

01:18:49.500 --> 01:18:51.500
- Just got my baby hairs.
- Sure.

01:18:52.500 --> 01:18:54.500
How exactly does
this friend-control mode thing work?

01:18:54.500 --> 01:18:58.500
Okay, so you know how the suit
can control the character in the game?

01:18:58.500 --> 01:18:59.500
I do, yeah.

01:18:59.500 --> 01:19:02.500
Friend-control mode
takes that concept to another level.

01:19:02.500 --> 01:19:06.500
But I didn't have any of my material,
so I had to use the electro stim pads

01:19:07.500 --> 01:19:10.500
to control his muscles.
Unfortunately, I ran out of stim pads,

01:19:10.500 --> 01:19:12.500
so it can pretty much
just walk and spin.

01:19:12.500 --> 01:19:15.500
Which is why I loaded the fists
full of those lava stones.

01:19:15.500 --> 01:19:18.500
So it's kind of like a
swinging sledgehammer type thing.

01:19:18.500 --> 01:19:20.500
Nice work, Joel.

01:19:21.500 --> 01:19:23.500
Sledgehammer spin-punching
robo-zombie.

01:19:23.500 --> 01:19:25.500
- Yeah.
- Cool.

01:19:25.500 --> 01:19:28.500
And the air fresheners are because...

01:19:28.500 --> 01:19:30.500
- He shit himself earlier.
- Mm-hm.

01:19:30.500 --> 01:19:31.500
- So...
- In the spa.

01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:33.500
- Little funky.
- Right, okay. Let's see something.

01:19:33.500 --> 01:19:35.500
oh, oh, oh.

01:19:35.500 --> 01:19:37.500
punching. Oh.

01:19:37.500 --> 01:19:38.500
- shit!
- Nice.

01:19:38.500 --> 01:19:40.500
- It's good.
- Cool.

01:19:40.500 --> 01:19:41.500
Okay, uh-oh.

01:19:41.500 --> 01:19:43.500
- Give me a shimmy-shimmy.
- We should, uh...

01:19:43.500 --> 01:19:44.500
Shake-a-shake-a-shake.

01:19:44.500 --> 01:19:46.500
- Dab it on him. Dab it on him.
- ...attack?

01:19:46.500 --> 01:19:47.500
- Alexxx, let's attack, please.
- Wiggle, wiggle.

01:19:48.500 --> 01:19:49.500
Yep, okay, yep.

01:19:49.500 --> 01:19:50.500
Nope, nope! No, no, no, no.

01:19:50.500 --> 01:19:52.500
- Okay, all right.
- It's just actually...

01:19:52.500 --> 01:19:53.500
no, I'm not ready.

01:19:53.500 --> 01:19:55.500
I have to tell you guys something,

01:19:55.500 --> 01:19:57.500
and it's been weighing on me
for a long time.

01:19:58.500 --> 01:20:00.500
- I am...
- A gay guy.

01:20:01.500 --> 01:20:03.500
Yep, we know. Zero to hero, go!

01:20:03.500 --> 01:20:05.500
Just don't have time, sorry.

01:20:08.500 --> 01:20:09.500
Rich, where have you been?

01:20:10.500 --> 01:20:11.500
And what...

01:20:11.500 --> 01:20:13.500
what are you, what are you wearing?

01:20:14.500 --> 01:20:16.500
Yo. It's the suit.

01:20:16.500 --> 01:20:18.500
Fuck you, bad guys.

01:20:18.500 --> 01:20:20.500
Fuck you, bad guys!

01:20:21.500 --> 01:20:24.500
<i>* Gimme fuel, gimme fire
Gimme that which I desire *</i>

01:20:29.500 --> 01:20:31.500
Be prepared to meet your maker,
motherfucker!

01:20:31.500 --> 01:20:32.500
Fists of fury, bitch!

01:20:40.500 --> 01:20:42.500
<i>* Yeah, *</i>

01:20:42.500 --> 01:20:45.500
Yeah! I spun right, you saw that.

01:20:45.500 --> 01:20:47.500
What do you mean,
"we know"?

01:20:47.500 --> 01:20:50.500
You've come out to us a hundred times.
It's your drunk thing. Get the guy.

01:20:54.500 --> 01:20:56.500
Yeah, the first time was prom
our senior year,

01:20:56.500 --> 01:20:58.500
and then a bunch of times in New Orleans.

01:20:58.500 --> 01:21:02.500
Something about Bourbon Street, man.
It brings it out of you, and then...

01:21:03.500 --> 01:21:05.500
Then when we got Osama bin Laden,
we all got really drunk,

01:21:05.500 --> 01:21:07.500
and you wouldn't shut the fuck up
about how gay you were.

01:21:14.500 --> 01:21:16.500
Why didn't you say anything?
This shit weighs heavily on me.

01:21:16.500 --> 01:21:19.500
You've never brought it up sober,
so we were kind of waiting for you to...

01:21:20.500 --> 01:21:21.500
well, do what you're doing now.

01:21:21.500 --> 01:21:23.500
This is the moment, yeah.
I suppose this is the moment.

01:21:23.500 --> 01:21:25.500
And by the way, congrats on coming out.

01:21:25.500 --> 01:21:26.500
- This is a big deal.
- Yeah.

01:21:27.500 --> 01:21:28.500
- Huge.
- That is huge.

01:21:28.500 --> 01:21:30.500
Look, the Skintendo Joysuit's working. That's awesome.

01:21:30.500 --> 01:21:32.500
Damn right.

01:21:32.500 --> 01:21:38.500
Yeah, I'm actually really surprised the Dirt Devil batteries aren't overheating.

01:21:38.500 --> 01:21:41.500
<i>* Quench my thirst with gasoline *</i>

01:21:41.500 --> 01:21:45.500
<i>* Gimme fuel, gimme fire
Gimme that which I desire *</i>

01:21:49.500 --> 01:21:52.500
God, and that is the Dirt Devil batteries overheating.

01:21:56.500 --> 01:21:58.500
That was fucking dope.

01:22:00.500 --> 01:22:01.500
Let's do this.

01:22:04.500 --> 01:22:06.500
Well, let's fuck some shit up.

01:22:06.500 --> 01:22:09.500
Joel, suddenly not scared of everything.

01:22:09.500 --> 01:22:11.500
Yeah. That was when I was in the closet.

01:22:11.500 --> 01:22:13.500
Now I'm the most powerful thing
in the world...

01:22:14.500 --> 01:22:17.500
a pissed-off gay dude.

01:22:18.500 --> 01:22:21.500
Stay in the back,
because we have guns and you don't.

01:22:21.500 --> 01:22:22.500
- Yep.
- Don't need one.

01:22:22.500 --> 01:22:23.500
- Ready?
- Let's do this.

01:22:23.500 --> 01:22:26.500
Let's do this!
Let's do this shit!

01:22:26.500 --> 01:22:28.500
Dew'd Crew!

01:22:29.500 --> 01:22:31.500
Bump it, bump it...

01:22:40.500 --> 01:22:43.500
Stop shooting, or he's dead.

01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:46.500
Yo, butler dude! It's over, man.

01:22:46.500 --> 01:22:49.500
I am not a butler!

01:22:49.500 --> 01:22:51.500
Yeah, right, and we're not waiters.

01:22:51.500 --> 01:22:52.500
We're not.

01:22:52.500 --> 01:22:54.500
- Well, we're waiters.
- We're like, okay.

01:22:54.500 --> 01:22:57.500
Look, cops have the place surrounded,
so drop your guns!

01:22:57.500 --> 01:22:59.500
Good advice.

01:22:59.500 --> 01:23:04.500
Put, your guns, down.

01:23:04.500 --> 01:23:05.500
Erma!

01:23:06.500 --> 01:23:08.500
- What happened to your face?
- Shut up!

01:23:08.500 --> 01:23:09.500
Go get the money.

01:23:09.500 --> 01:23:11.500
Let's go!

01:23:11.500 --> 01:23:14.500
Excuse me, ma'am.

01:23:14.500 --> 01:23:17.500
I do not appreciate the way
you've been trying to kill us tonight.

01:23:17.500 --> 01:23:19.500
- I don't think she cares, man.
- Mm.

01:23:19.500 --> 01:23:21.500
Erma, have your fun
and get up to the roof.

01:23:21.500 --> 01:23:22.500
Alan, grab what you can.

01:23:22.500 --> 01:23:27.500
shit, your boyfriend's leaving.
You should probably roll with him, right?

01:23:27.500 --> 01:23:30.500
He is not, my boyfriend!

01:23:31.500 --> 01:23:32.500
Okay, you're single. Cool. What's up?

01:23:32.500 --> 01:23:36.500
I, am a trained killer on a job.

01:23:37.500 --> 01:23:38.500
And you...

01:23:39.500 --> 01:23:41.500
are in my office.

01:23:44.500 --> 01:23:46.500
Uh, Joel, what are you doing?
She's gonna blow your brains out, man.

01:23:48.500 --> 01:23:53.500
You, need to apologize.

01:23:54.500 --> 01:23:55.500
Okay?

01:23:55.500 --> 01:23:56.500
He's gay now.

01:24:05.500 --> 01:24:07.500
shit.

01:24:13.500 --> 01:24:16.500
I don't do apologies, faggot.

01:24:16.500 --> 01:24:20.500
I know you didn't
just call me the F word!

01:24:20.500 --> 01:24:21.500
Joel, you haven't even fucked a dude yet.

01:24:21.500 --> 01:24:23.500
Yes, I have.

01:24:23.500 --> 01:24:25.500
And in the butt's better than vagina.

01:24:26.500 --> 01:24:28.500
- Way better.
- Chicks have butts too, though.

01:24:32.500 --> 01:24:35.500
dude, I just slapped
the shit out of her.

01:24:35.500 --> 01:24:36.500
- Yeah, you did.
- That was awesome. Nice, Joel.

01:24:37.500 --> 01:24:38.500
- Look out!
- Watch out!

01:24:39.500 --> 01:24:41.500
This ends now!

01:24:44.500 --> 01:24:46.500
- man!
- no.

01:24:48.500 --> 01:24:50.500
- Get him, Erma!
- Come on, Joel!

01:24:50.500 --> 01:24:52.500
Let's go, Joel!

01:24:53.500 --> 01:24:54.500
Take that!

01:24:54.500 --> 01:24:56.500
- Yeah!
- Little fucker!

01:24:56.500 --> 01:24:58.500
Yeah, fuck you, bitch!

01:25:00.500 --> 01:25:04.500
You like that? You like picking on people
'cause they're different?

01:25:12.500 --> 01:25:14.500
No, no! Joel!

01:25:22.500 --> 01:25:24.500
Right in the numbers.

01:25:39.500 --> 01:25:40.500
Yes!

01:25:40.500 --> 01:25:42.500
Yes!

01:25:42.500 --> 01:25:44.500
- You get outta here.
- Ha!

01:25:45.500 --> 01:25:47.500
Ho, ho, ho, ho!

01:25:47.500 --> 01:25:50.500
Baby Dunc with the slam dunk.

01:25:50.500 --> 01:25:53.500
Yes! Tom fucking Brady!

01:25:53.500 --> 01:25:54.500
- Not Tom Brady.
- No.

01:25:54.500 --> 01:25:56.500
- He plays football, not basketball.
- Slam dunk.

01:25:56.500 --> 01:25:57.500
If anyone's Tom Brady, it's my man Mitch.

01:25:57.500 --> 01:26:00.500
- We thought you were dead, dude.
- Mitch, your dick.

01:26:00.500 --> 01:26:02.500
Eh, don't worry about it, boys.

01:26:02.500 --> 01:26:03.500
We live in Los Angeles.

01:26:04.500 --> 01:26:08.500
Eh, I give it eight weeks before me
and the Swamp Thing get reattached,

01:26:08.500 --> 01:26:11.500
or regrown, or whatever the hell
they're gonna do to get us back

01:26:11.500 --> 01:26:13.500
to fuckin' half this town,
am I right, boy?

01:26:13.500 --> 01:26:15.500
Is everybody okay? Huh?

01:26:15.500 --> 01:26:17.500
Cassie, huh? You okay?

01:26:17.500 --> 01:26:22.500
Yeah, I-I'm a little shaken, but I feel...
oh, I feel okay.

01:26:22.500 --> 01:26:25.500
.. that promotion is yours.

01:26:25.500 --> 01:26:27.500
- Really?
- You earned it.

01:26:27.500 --> 01:26:30.500
- Yes.
- Now put my pecker on ice, huh?

01:26:30.500 --> 01:26:31.500
Wow, what a night, boys.

01:26:31.500 --> 01:26:34.500
I have been crawling around this hotel
for hours.

01:26:34.500 --> 01:26:35.500
- Ooh.
- You know what, Mitch?

01:26:35.500 --> 01:26:37.500
- Huh?
- I have a better idea.

01:26:38.500 --> 01:26:41.500
How's about I call corporate
and tell them what a disgusting

01:26:41.500 --> 01:26:46.500
excuse for a man you are
and demand that you be fired immediately?

01:26:46.500 --> 01:26:50.500
No, not because I want your job
or a promotion.

01:26:50.500 --> 01:26:54.500
Because I want you to know
that if you behave like a pig,

01:26:54.500 --> 01:26:56.500
you deserve to get stuck like one.

01:27:00.500 --> 01:27:04.500
- Wow!
- Sixty-one yards.

01:27:04.500 --> 01:27:07.500
New Mexico High School state record,
boy or girl.

01:27:07.500 --> 01:27:09.500
I'll make it up.

01:27:09.500 --> 01:27:12.500
Let me just get my head together,
and we'll talk about it, all right?

01:27:14.500 --> 01:27:16.500
Somebody get my dick for me there, huh?
A little help?

01:27:20.500 --> 01:27:22.500
- Where's Erma?
- She's gone.

01:27:22.500 --> 01:27:24.500
What, you didn't grab any money?

01:27:24.500 --> 01:27:25.500
No, I just want...

01:27:26.500 --> 01:27:27.500
Get this thing in the air already.

01:27:27.500 --> 01:27:30.500
Okay, but I haven't actually
technically flown this type of...

01:27:30.500 --> 01:27:32.500
Alan, helicopter, air, now!

01:27:32.500 --> 01:27:34.500
I'm not the one that shot the pilot!

01:27:51.500 --> 01:27:53.500
Wait!

01:27:53.500 --> 01:27:57.500
Why are their pockets inside out?

01:27:58.500 --> 01:28:00.500
We're the waiters from before!

01:28:00.500 --> 01:28:02.500
We want to buy the Bey back!

01:28:02.500 --> 01:28:05.500
Please, we got all your money, look!
You can have it all!

01:28:07.500 --> 01:28:08.500
We just want the Bey!

01:28:08.500 --> 01:28:11.500
If I give you the Bey, they shoot me out of the sky.

01:28:11.500 --> 01:28:15.500
We brought an empty bag!
The Bey can just climb inside!

01:28:15.500 --> 01:28:17.500
What?

01:28:17.500 --> 01:28:22.500
They'll never know that he left the helicopter, and you get all your money!

01:28:22.500 --> 01:28:25.500
Okay! Hurry!

01:28:25.500 --> 01:28:27.500
Goddamn.

01:28:27.500 --> 01:28:29.500
Get in. Come on.

01:28:29.500 --> 01:28:31.500
Look, I'm saving you, dude.
I'm saving you.

01:28:31.500 --> 01:28:34.500
Shut the fuck up.

01:28:34.500 --> 01:28:37.500
You fucking asshole! I will fucking kill you, dog!

01:28:37.500 --> 01:28:40.500
- Don't you fucking close that...
- Let's get him out of here.

01:28:41.500 --> 01:28:43.500
- All right, you got all the money.
- Right.

01:28:43.500 --> 01:28:44.500
Thanks. You're not gonna regret this.

01:28:44.500 --> 01:28:47.500
Let's make sure of that.

01:28:50.500 --> 01:28:51.500
Jesus.

01:28:52.500 --> 01:28:54.500
- Get rid of him.
- Goddamn it.

01:28:56.500 --> 01:28:58.500
Alan, let's go.

01:29:01.500 --> 01:29:02.500
Open it up!

01:29:05.500 --> 01:29:06.500
Come on, open it.

01:29:06.500 --> 01:29:07.500
He's alive.

01:29:07.500 --> 01:29:09.500
- My God! shit!
- Are you okay?

01:29:09.500 --> 01:29:11.500
Fuck, that motherfucker shot me!

01:29:11.500 --> 01:29:13.500
I can't believe he's getting away
with this shit!

01:29:14.500 --> 01:29:16.500
He's not. Watch this shit.

01:29:17.500 --> 01:29:18.500
Cassie.

01:29:18.500 --> 01:29:20.500
Time to let the dogs out.

01:29:21.500 --> 01:29:22.500
Over. You gotta say "over."

01:29:22.500 --> 01:29:25.500
Okay, everybody, that's it!
Let's go! Let's go!

01:29:25.500 --> 01:29:26.500
Let's go!

01:29:28.500 --> 01:29:29.500
Faster!

01:29:42.500 --> 01:29:43.500
No.

01:29:45.500 --> 01:29:46.500
No!

01:29:48.500 --> 01:29:50.500
It worked!

01:29:50.500 --> 01:29:52.500
He fucking blew up.

01:29:52.500 --> 01:29:55.500
Yes!
man. It's kind of fun being badass.

01:29:55.500 --> 01:29:57.500
Yeah, yeah, it is pretty exciting.

01:29:59.500 --> 01:30:01.500
- I told you guys.
- You did.

01:30:01.500 --> 01:30:03.500
You did, man. I'm sorry I doubted you.

01:30:05.500 --> 01:30:08.500
- Get me to a fucking hospital!
- Yep, okay.

01:30:08.500 --> 01:30:09.500
Dumb fucks!

01:30:16.500 --> 01:30:17.500
Okay, so, you know,

01:30:17.500 --> 01:30:19.500
we'll start working
on the Skintendo Joysuit right away

01:30:20.500 --> 01:30:21.500
and then keep you in the loop.

01:30:21.500 --> 01:30:23.500
Yeah, and we are going to need
another check.

01:30:23.500 --> 01:30:24.500
Yeah.

01:30:24.500 --> 01:30:26.500
Our lives are in a pretty bad place
right now,

01:30:26.500 --> 01:30:28.500
and that check is gonna
change our lives forever.

01:30:28.500 --> 01:30:30.500
Fuck are you talking about?
I'm not writing you guys another check.

01:30:30.500 --> 01:30:32.500
Hold on. Wait one second.

01:30:32.500 --> 01:30:35.500
Why aren't you gonna...
he's concussed, right?

01:30:35.500 --> 01:30:38.500
He's got something up with his brain?
Is it jiggling around in there?

01:30:38.500 --> 01:30:41.500
Bitch, the only reason I wrote that check
was to piss off Ahmad,

01:30:41.500 --> 01:30:44.500
'cause that shit made me laugh.

01:30:46.500 --> 01:30:47.500
My tummy.

01:30:49.500 --> 01:30:50.500
Get me the fuck up out of here.

01:30:51.500 --> 01:30:52.500
Come on.

01:30:52.500 --> 01:30:54.500
And play with my balls. Make sure my dick still works.

01:30:54.500 --> 01:30:57.500
I do not get that. He seemed like such a stand-up guy on the Instagram.

01:30:57.500 --> 01:30:59.500
- He's an asshole.
- Piece of shit.

01:30:59.500 --> 01:31:04.500
Excuse me. Guys, I'm Mark Cuban. I'm a friend of the Bey's. I was up there tonight.

01:31:04.500 --> 01:31:06.500
- I saw you guys had that bodysuit thing.
- Yeah.

01:31:06.500 --> 01:31:07.500
Holy fuckin' shit!

01:31:07.500 --> 01:31:13.500
Yeah, yup, we're gettin' Shark Tanked.
Mark Cuban wants to buy the Skintendo Joysuit!

01:31:13.500 --> 01:31:15.500
Skintendo Joysuit? That's what you named it?

01:31:15.500 --> 01:31:17.500
- Yeah, I named it.
- Good name, right?

01:31:17.500 --> 01:31:20.500
That's bad. No. I'm definitely not interested.

01:31:20.500 --> 01:31:25.500
However, what you just went through tonight was pretty hard-core.

01:31:25.500 --> 01:31:29.500
I'd like to buy your story, turn it into a video game starring you guys

01:31:29.500 --> 01:31:33.500
voiced over and visually modeled after famous actors, of course.

01:31:33.500 --> 01:31:35.500
- I call Sean Astin.
- Mark-Paul Gosselaar, please!

01:31:35.500 --> 01:31:37.500
Uh, Cara Delevingne. I don't know.

01:31:37.500 --> 01:31:39.500
- Whoever we can get.
- I don't know.

01:31:39.500 --> 01:31:41.500
- All right, guys.
- Awesome. Thank you so much.

01:31:41.500 --> 01:31:42.500
he even walks cool. Sick blanket.

01:31:42.500 --> 01:31:44.500
- See you, Marky Cubes.
- Ring-a-ling.

01:31:44.500 --> 01:31:45.500
- Sweet.
- That was awesome!

01:31:45.500 --> 01:31:46.500
That's funny. Wow.

01:32:02.500 --> 01:32:04.500
Announcement! Announcement!
Shut, shut up.

01:32:05.500 --> 01:32:07.500
Shut up real quick. I'm gonna make an announcement.

01:32:07.500 --> 01:32:14.500
Look. Now, I know we are the millionaire video game mavens that chartered this Costa Rica cruise

01:32:14.500 --> 01:32:19.500
for 100 of our closest friends, yes, but I wanna congratulate you guys for having

01:32:19.500 --> 01:32:22.500
the best butt-cheeks in the business!

01:32:22.500 --> 01:32:23.500
You guys are hot as fuck.

01:32:23.500 --> 01:32:25.500
And shake 'em if you got 'em!

01:32:29.500 --> 01:32:31.500
Dinner bell's ringing.
Come and get it, boys.

01:32:31.500 --> 01:32:35.500
- Come and get it, huh?
- Joel, I am so proud of you, dude.

01:32:36.500 --> 01:32:37.500
Not a day goes by that I miss

01:32:37.500 --> 01:32:41.500
that shy, closeted bitch
that you once were, and I mean that.

01:32:41.500 --> 01:32:43.500
- Thanks, man.
- And Darren?

01:32:43.500 --> 01:32:46.500
I am beyond thrilled that you are
no longer a controlling asshole

01:32:46.500 --> 01:32:49.500
who needs to smoke salvia just to get by.

01:32:49.500 --> 01:32:51.500
Haven't touched the stuff
since that night.

01:32:51.500 --> 01:32:52.500
- Good.
- You know that.

01:32:52.500 --> 01:32:54.500
Yeah.

01:32:54.500 --> 01:32:57.500
Just doing cocaine now, you know.
But for fun.

01:32:57.500 --> 01:32:58.500
It's better for you.

01:32:58.500 --> 01:33:01.500
Ah! This is the best, guys.

01:33:01.500 --> 01:33:03.500
Look at us.
Rich beyond our wildest dreams.

01:33:04.500 --> 01:33:06.500
- Darren doing cocaine for fun.
- Shh.

01:33:06.500 --> 01:33:09.500
Joel is, like, fricking wiggling
his dick around, just begging for cock.

01:33:09.500 --> 01:33:11.500
I'm not, I'm not begging yet.

01:33:12.500 --> 01:33:15.500
Darren, tell Alexxx
about that video game idea.

01:33:15.500 --> 01:33:17.500
yeah. Okay.

01:33:17.500 --> 01:33:18.500
New idea, new game:

01:33:19.500 --> 01:33:22.500
leprechauns, but they're tall.

01:33:22.500 --> 01:33:24.500
that is a clever twist.

01:33:26.500 --> 01:33:29.500
No. Nope.
I'm not all about making money anymore.

01:33:29.500 --> 01:33:32.500
You know what I'm about? Best friends.

01:33:33.500 --> 01:33:34.500
Put your hands in.

01:33:36.500 --> 01:33:38.500
Dew'd Crew!

01:33:39.500 --> 01:33:40.500
Booty bump, a-booty bump!

01:33:41.500 --> 01:33:43.500
Yes! We're gonna live forever!

01:33:43.500 --> 01:33:45.500
We're never gonna die!
