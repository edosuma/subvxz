WEBVTT

00:00.861 --> 00:02.395
Okay, I have a question:

00:02.529 --> 00:05.331
This sauce recipe calls
for a cup of onions,

00:05.366 --> 00:07.367
but all of our cups are different sizes.

00:08.435 --> 00:09.736
Relax, Dude.

00:09.770 --> 00:12.338
I'm pretty sure they
always mean the biggest.

00:13.641 --> 00:15.408
I'm just trying to do
something special for Georgie

00:15.442 --> 00:16.676
and I want to do it right.

00:16.710 --> 00:18.745
This isn't too weird for
you, is it? Us dating?

00:18.779 --> 00:21.781
No, not at all. I can tell when
two people are meant to be together,

00:21.815 --> 00:23.416
like you and Georgie...

00:23.450 --> 00:25.718
- Look at you be all mature.
- ...And me and Riley.

00:25.753 --> 00:27.687
Look at you being all irrational.

00:27.721 --> 00:30.556
No, Dude, it's true. We've
been hanging out a lot lately

00:30.591 --> 00:32.392
and I can tell that something has changed.

00:32.426 --> 00:34.794
Yeah, she doesn't seem to
want you dead so much anymore.

00:34.828 --> 00:37.597
I know. Right? It's awesome!

00:37.631 --> 00:39.666
I definitely won her friendship back,

00:39.700 --> 00:41.801
now I just gotta convince her
that we're destined to be together.

00:41.835 --> 00:44.203
- How do you plan on doing that?
- I just gotta figure out

00:44.237 --> 00:45.471
a way for us to spend some time alone...

00:45.506 --> 00:47.640
But I gotta be subtle and not too obvious.

00:47.675 --> 00:51.844
Knock knock! Hey, so guess
who gets to spend 30 hours

00:51.879 --> 00:54.814
on some stupid train to go
to some stupid family reunion.

00:54.848 --> 00:56.816
I'll go! Can I go? Let me go! It'll be fun.

00:58.786 --> 01:01.454
Not so subtle, but you've
got the obvious part down.

01:02.623 --> 01:04.724
- Still afraid of flying?
- Oh no, I love flying.

01:04.757 --> 01:08.795
It's the plummeting 30,000 feet to my
death that I'm just not a huge fan of.

01:08.829 --> 01:11.531
So Danny can watch Emma

01:11.565 --> 01:13.700
and we'll have ourselves
a little train adventure.

01:13.734 --> 01:15.535
Should be fun...

01:15.569 --> 01:16.669
and innocent.

01:19.740 --> 01:21.607
- What are you up to?
- Nothing.

01:21.642 --> 01:23.342
Why would I be up to anything?

01:23.377 --> 01:24.677
You are so distrustful.

01:24.712 --> 01:27.447
We'll be all alone, right?

01:27.481 --> 01:29.482
And now I see what you're up to.

01:29.516 --> 01:32.618
Okay. Ben, if we do this,

01:32.653 --> 01:36.422
"all aboard" only means "get on the train."

01:36.457 --> 01:37.724
Okay?

01:37.758 --> 01:39.792
We are just friends. You got it?

01:39.827 --> 01:41.494
Yeah, I got it.

01:43.530 --> 01:45.798
(Mouths)

01:45.833 --> 01:47.433
- (Softly)
- Emma.

Hello, everyone, and welcome

02:19.600 --> 02:20.733
I'm Mary Hart,

02:20.768 --> 02:24.437
and I'd like to introduce
you to my new co-host.

02:24.471 --> 02:26.572
Hello, America. I'm Tucker Dobbs.

02:26.607 --> 02:29.642
Now sit back, relax and let me tuck you in.

02:29.676 --> 02:30.810
(Laughs)

02:30.844 --> 02:32.745
"Tuck you in"?

02:32.780 --> 02:35.381
- Yeah.
- Congratulations.

02:35.415 --> 02:37.750
You've managed to be boring and creepy.

02:37.785 --> 02:40.787
Okay, would it kill you
to be a little supportive?

02:40.821 --> 02:42.789
Hey, you want support, stop wearing boxers.

02:44.725 --> 02:47.393
You said Mary was looking for a co-host.

02:47.427 --> 02:51.364
I mean, I'm sure that she
wants one with some pizzaz.

02:51.398 --> 02:53.800
Well, the co-host was the network's idea.

02:53.834 --> 02:55.668
I mean, all she wants
is a bigger shoe budget

02:55.702 --> 02:57.837
- and a masseuse named Julio.
- Yeah.

02:57.871 --> 03:00.406
Well, Tucker, I think you should go for it.

03:00.440 --> 03:01.741
Really? You think I'd make a good co-host?

03:01.775 --> 03:03.609
No, I think you could pass
for a masseuse named Julio.

03:03.644 --> 03:06.546
- Waza.
- (Mimics gunshots)

03:06.580 --> 03:09.348
All right, okay. How's this? How's this?

03:09.383 --> 03:12.518
Hello, ladies. Let me tuckle your fancy.

03:12.553 --> 03:13.753
(Laughs)

03:17.624 --> 03:19.692
Well, I don't know if that's a good intro,

03:19.726 --> 03:21.527
but it does explain why you're single.

03:23.397 --> 03:26.399
Oh, Ben, thank you so much
for getting the tickets.

03:26.433 --> 03:30.503
That's so sweet. I can't believe
we have our own compartment.

03:30.537 --> 03:32.438
That is so...

03:32.472 --> 03:34.340
Just like you,

03:34.374 --> 03:36.375
because there is only one bed.

03:36.410 --> 03:38.544
Why is there only one bed?

03:38.579 --> 03:39.745
And what exactly did you think

03:39.780 --> 03:41.814
was going to happen in this one bed?

03:41.849 --> 03:43.583
I'm sure it's just a mistake.

03:43.617 --> 03:45.451
I had nothing to do with this.

03:45.485 --> 03:47.453
Ah. Mr. Wheeler,

03:47.487 --> 03:49.522
the bed's been made up
just as you requested.

03:49.556 --> 03:53.459
Sounds like you and the missus have
quite the romantic night planned.

03:54.628 --> 03:56.362
Romantic night?

03:56.396 --> 03:59.498
I don't know where he'd get
such an inappropriate idea.

03:59.533 --> 04:00.566
From your e-mail.

04:01.635 --> 04:03.636
Ben Wheeler, I...

04:03.670 --> 04:06.339
I told you this train
wasn't going to "Sex Town".

04:06.373 --> 04:08.407
God, you have a one-track mind.

04:08.442 --> 04:10.443
Get out. Get out. Get
out, get out, get out.

04:10.477 --> 04:11.711
- Oh God. Both of you.
- (Sighs)

04:16.416 --> 04:18.551
You were supposed to make
up the bed after dinner.

04:18.584 --> 04:20.418
Well, it's dinnertime somewhere.

04:22.456 --> 04:23.656
(Bonnie laughs)

04:23.690 --> 04:26.392
And that's all the time we have for today.

04:26.426 --> 04:29.395
Until next time, let's
tuck it out, America.

04:31.732 --> 04:34.367
So? What do you think?

04:34.401 --> 04:36.469
When they told me Tucker
wanted to submit a tape,

04:36.503 --> 04:38.571
my first thought was, "who?"

04:40.440 --> 04:43.676
But now I have to say I
think I found my new co-host.

04:43.710 --> 04:45.578
Really?! You did?!

04:45.612 --> 04:47.780
Oh, this is like my dream come true.

04:47.814 --> 04:51.517
- She is hilarious.
- (Laughs)

04:51.551 --> 04:53.653
Yes, she is.

04:53.687 --> 04:57.390
Wait wait wait, hold up.
He... she who-sh... who?

04:57.424 --> 05:01.327
Bonnie. She is exactly what
I'm looking for in a co-host...

05:01.361 --> 05:05.398
Someone who makes my pretty and
funny seem prettier and funnier.

05:06.733 --> 05:09.368
How soon do you think we can
get her in for a camera test?

05:09.403 --> 05:11.404
Wait wait wait, Bonnie Wheeler?

05:11.438 --> 05:13.706
Okay, are you sure there wasn't anyone else

05:13.740 --> 05:16.575
in that audition that
might've caught your eye?

05:16.610 --> 05:20.379
Well, you were, but you
were just boring and creepy.

05:21.615 --> 05:24.317
(Chuckles)

05:24.351 --> 05:27.320
Mary, I was just being silly,

05:27.354 --> 05:29.388
- you silly.
- (Laughs)

05:29.423 --> 05:31.457
- Don't ever touch me again.
- Yes, ma'am.

05:31.491 --> 05:33.459
Okay.

05:33.493 --> 05:35.528
Look, the only problem is

05:35.562 --> 05:39.565
I'm just not so sure that Bonnie
is that interested in the job.

05:41.368 --> 05:45.438
- (Shouts)
- Yeah!

05:45.472 --> 05:49.542
(Laughs)

05:49.576 --> 05:53.512
Oh yeah!

05:53.547 --> 05:56.349
Yes, I'm gonna be on TV!

05:58.452 --> 06:00.386
(Sniffling)

06:01.521 --> 06:03.589
Oh, you stop judging
me. You cry all the time.

06:05.559 --> 06:07.626
<i>- What does it say to do next?
- (Cellphone ringing)</i>

06:09.529 --> 06:11.664
- (Beeps)
- Hello?

06:11.698 --> 06:13.733
So this whole Riley thing
is a complete disaster.

06:13.767 --> 06:15.568
What is wrong with me?

06:15.602 --> 06:17.403
I've tried to tell you
that a gabillion times,

06:17.437 --> 06:18.604
and now you're ready to hear it?

06:18.638 --> 06:21.674
- (Call waiting beeps)
- Hang on a sec.

06:21.708 --> 06:23.709
- Hello?
- Hi. Oh my God,

06:23.744 --> 06:26.312
why is your brother just such a jerk?

06:26.346 --> 06:28.381
Weird. I was about to
answer the same question.

06:28.415 --> 06:30.349
We just got back to friends

06:30.384 --> 06:32.451
and now he wants to skip right to benefits.

06:32.486 --> 06:33.753
Can you hold on for like two seconds?

06:33.787 --> 06:35.755
- Yeah.
- (Beeps)

06:35.789 --> 06:37.390
I think you should move on.

06:37.424 --> 06:39.558
- (Scoffs)
- Move on? I have moved on.

06:39.593 --> 06:41.360
He's the one who keeps moving in.

06:41.395 --> 06:42.595
Are you not listening to me?

06:42.629 --> 06:45.398
- Sorry, I'll be right back.
- (Beeps)

06:45.432 --> 06:46.766
- Ben?
- Yeah.

06:46.800 --> 06:48.567
I think you just need to move on.

06:48.602 --> 06:50.503
Move on? I was just starting to move in.

06:50.537 --> 06:51.637
Yeah, I know. I heard.

06:51.671 --> 06:54.440
Danny, she thinks all I care about is sex.

06:54.474 --> 06:56.409
- And you don't?
- (Chuckles): Well,

06:56.443 --> 06:58.511
I mean, yeah, it's pretty
high up on the list,

06:58.545 --> 07:00.513
but that's not the whole
point of this trip.

07:00.514 --> 07:01.114
(Beeps)

07:01.148 --> 07:03.449
Listen, I think you should just relax

07:03.483 --> 07:05.584
- and stop being so pushy.
- (Laughs): Relax?

07:05.619 --> 07:07.319
I... I am relaxed.

07:07.354 --> 07:09.321
I am about to just pushy
him right off this train.

07:09.356 --> 07:11.323
- Um, hold please.
- (Beeps)

07:11.358 --> 07:12.591
- Ben?
- Yeah.

07:12.626 --> 07:14.627
I think you should probably
just lay low for a while.

07:14.661 --> 07:16.462
Well, since she kicked me out of the cabin,

07:16.496 --> 07:18.330
it's gonna be kind of hard
to find a place to do that.

07:18.365 --> 07:20.599
- Um, hold that thought.
- (Beeps)

07:20.634 --> 07:22.601
I think you should probably
just lay low for a while.

07:22.636 --> 07:23.769
Dude, are you having a stroke?

07:23.804 --> 07:25.438
You literally just said that.

07:25.472 --> 07:27.506
- Damn it.
- (Beeps)

07:27.541 --> 07:28.541
- Riley?
- Yeah.

07:28.575 --> 07:29.708
Yeah, don't worry about Ben.

07:29.743 --> 07:31.377
I think he's just gonna
lay low for a while.

07:31.411 --> 07:33.579
- (Scoffs)
- Well, God knows he's been trying to lay

07:33.613 --> 07:35.481
just everywhere else.

07:36.716 --> 07:39.718
- Oh my God. Ben.
- Yeah, I get it.

07:39.753 --> 07:42.588
- He's a jerk. I know.
- No no no, his screensaver...

07:42.622 --> 07:46.459
It's a picture of us. Oh my
God, I remember this day so well.

07:46.493 --> 07:48.494
I just... I wanted it to last forever.

07:50.430 --> 07:51.697
God, what... what is the matter with me?

07:51.731 --> 07:53.532
Why am I fighting this?

07:53.567 --> 07:55.734
I have been pushing him away for so long

07:55.769 --> 07:58.337
that I can't even remember why.

07:58.371 --> 08:00.739
Obviously, he wants to be with me,

08:00.774 --> 08:04.510
and God knows I can't
stop thinking about him.

08:04.544 --> 08:06.512
Maybe I should just say yes.

08:06.546 --> 08:07.613
Ahh!

08:07.647 --> 08:09.448
Thank you so much, Danny.

08:09.483 --> 08:10.683
- You were amazing.
- (Beeps)

08:10.717 --> 08:14.320
- Hello?
- (Gasps)

08:18.792 --> 08:20.526
I won't say anything if you don't.

08:22.762 --> 08:24.730
(Both laughing)

08:26.700 --> 08:28.567
Are you kidding me?

08:30.604 --> 08:32.304
Table for one?

08:35.817 --> 08:37.817
Look at him.

08:37.818 --> 08:39.386
Laughing, flirting.

08:39.422 --> 08:41.590
It's... it's like he doesn't even care.

08:41.624 --> 08:44.793
Oh, Peaches, it's like I always say...

08:44.827 --> 08:46.561
women are like trains.

08:46.596 --> 08:48.730
You miss one, there's
always another one coming.

08:51.500 --> 08:52.867
Well, this one is going.

08:54.870 --> 08:57.672
So this Riley girl sounds pretty special.

08:57.707 --> 08:59.474
Oh, she's not just special.

08:59.508 --> 09:01.476
She's the one.

09:03.479 --> 09:05.447
I just wish I knew how
to make her see that.

09:07.850 --> 09:09.751
Okay, Emma,

09:09.785 --> 09:13.455
"Add egg, onion and salt to taste."

09:13.489 --> 09:15.657
Taste like what? Salt tastes like salt.

09:15.691 --> 09:19.628
- (Cellphone rings, beeps)
- Hello?

09:19.662 --> 09:21.596
- Danny.
- Oh, Tucker, perfect timing.

09:21.631 --> 09:23.665
- Hey, I need some advice.
- Yeah, me too.

09:23.699 --> 09:25.533
How many tablespoons are in a teaspoon?

09:25.568 --> 09:27.535
I don't know, maybe like 30?

09:27.570 --> 09:29.638
- Oh, thanks, Dude, I was way under.
- (Beeps)

09:32.608 --> 09:34.743
(Clicks, ringing)

09:34.777 --> 09:38.847
- What's up?
- Danny, I'm the one that called you.

09:38.881 --> 09:41.383
I know. I said, "what's up?"

09:41.417 --> 09:43.618
No. No no no, before.

09:43.653 --> 09:44.786
You know what? Never mind.

09:44.820 --> 09:46.554
All right, what would you do

09:46.589 --> 09:49.391
if another player tried to
take your position on the team

09:49.425 --> 09:50.659
and you wanted to get rid of her

09:50.693 --> 09:52.394
but still seem like the nice guy?

09:52.428 --> 09:54.429
Easy. There are no girls in hockey.

09:54.463 --> 09:56.464
- Problem solved.
- (Call waiting beeps)

09:56.499 --> 09:58.466
- Hang on a sec.
- (Beeps)

09:58.501 --> 10:01.436
- Hello?
- Oh my God, Danny, I lost Ben.

10:01.470 --> 10:02.737
Did you check The Lost and Found?

10:02.772 --> 10:04.472
No, he met someone else.

10:04.507 --> 10:06.708
What are... what are the
chances of that even happening?

10:06.742 --> 10:08.877
Well, it's Ben, so 100%?

10:08.911 --> 10:11.846
So what do I do now? Do I just walk away?

10:11.881 --> 10:13.882
- Hang on a sec.
- (Beeps)

10:13.916 --> 10:15.684
Okay, here's the deal:

10:15.718 --> 10:17.485
You need to fight for what
you want, no matter what.

10:17.520 --> 10:18.720
Otherwise, you're never gonna get it.

10:18.754 --> 10:20.689
Fight for what I want.

10:20.723 --> 10:22.524
You know what? You're right.

10:22.558 --> 10:24.659
For once, I... I am going to fight.

10:24.694 --> 10:26.494
- Riley?
- Thank you, Danny.

10:26.529 --> 10:27.729
That was... that was really good advice.

10:27.763 --> 10:29.497
- (Sighs)
- (Beeps)

10:29.532 --> 10:30.765
- Tucker?
- Yup.

10:30.800 --> 10:33.902
Still here. I read a
book and knitted a scarf.

10:33.936 --> 10:35.837
- Still here.
- Okay, here's the deal:

10:35.871 --> 10:37.605
You need to fight for what you want,

10:37.640 --> 10:39.874
otherwise, you will never get
it. Don't take no for an answer.

10:39.909 --> 10:42.444
Don't think of anyone else's
feelings other than your own.

10:42.478 --> 10:44.512
- (Chuckles)
- Thanks, dude.

10:44.547 --> 10:45.847
You know, that's really good advice.

10:45.881 --> 10:47.749
Yeah, I'm kind of on a roll.

10:48.851 --> 10:50.819
Oh, excuse me, Mr. Porter guy,

10:50.853 --> 10:52.821
could you maybe help me
with something in here?

10:52.855 --> 10:54.656
(Chuckles)

10:54.690 --> 10:56.725
What I wouldn't give to go a day

10:56.759 --> 10:58.526
without getting hit on.

11:01.530 --> 11:03.665
I'm Tucker Dobbs.

11:03.699 --> 11:06.534
Dude, perfect, right?

11:06.569 --> 11:09.738
Hey, Tuck Tuck. Thanks
for warming my chair.

11:09.772 --> 11:11.673
Now how about warming my
tummy with some coffee?

11:11.707 --> 11:13.742
- Chop chop. (Clicks tongue)
- (Scoffs)

11:13.776 --> 11:16.478
I cannot believe that you are
really going through with this.

11:16.512 --> 11:20.448
Well, I'm sorry. But The Mary Hart
wants what The Mary Hart wants.

11:20.483 --> 11:22.650
And Mary Hart wants me, not you.

11:22.685 --> 11:25.520
- (Both chuckle)
- This is my calling.

11:25.554 --> 11:27.489
Ring ring.

11:27.523 --> 11:29.524
Oh, wait. Oh, look,

11:29.558 --> 11:31.626
- I'm my calling...
- (Laughs)

11:31.660 --> 11:33.862
Calling to tell your calling
that you stole my calling.

11:33.896 --> 11:35.430
(Grunts)

11:35.464 --> 11:37.699
But you know what? I'm a professional,

11:37.733 --> 11:39.501
and my job is to help you.

11:39.535 --> 11:40.769
Well, how hard could it be?

11:40.803 --> 11:42.604
I just have to read these cards.

11:42.638 --> 11:44.639
Yeah, fine, you know? Just read the cards.

11:47.476 --> 11:50.745
That is if you wanna totally suck.

11:50.780 --> 11:52.680
- (Laughs)
- I mean, you know what?

11:52.715 --> 11:54.716
A little inside advice:
Just lose the cards.

11:54.750 --> 11:57.585
- Really?
- Yeah, Mary responds to spontaneity.

11:57.620 --> 11:59.412
- Oh my God, thank you, Tucker.
- Yeah.

11:59.546 --> 12:01.446
Oh God, I would've made a fool of myself.

12:01.447 --> 12:02.880
Nobody wants that.

12:02.881 --> 12:04.748
- (Sighs)
- Oh, anything else?

12:04.783 --> 12:06.784
- Actually, yeah.
- Oh yeah? Good, give it.

12:06.818 --> 12:08.519
Yeah, touch her as much as possible.

12:08.553 --> 12:10.721
- Oh. Okay.
- Mary loves to be touched.

12:10.755 --> 12:13.590
And don't worry about time. The
longer your anecdotes, the better.

12:13.625 --> 12:16.760
And remember: Any thought,
no matter how small, silly

12:16.795 --> 12:19.430
or offensive it may seem,
just throw it out there.

12:19.464 --> 12:20.831
Throw it out there. Okay. Okay.

12:20.865 --> 12:22.699
Oh, here's Mary.

12:22.734 --> 12:26.537
Okay, people, I have a
charity event at 7:00,

12:26.571 --> 12:28.238
but that means I have to be there at 6:45

12:28.272 --> 12:31.575
- to find out what it's about.
- (Bonnie and Tucker laugh)

12:31.609 --> 12:34.411
All right, people, are we
ready to make some memories?

12:34.446 --> 12:35.646
- Yes.
- (Snaps): I know I am.

12:35.680 --> 12:38.782
- (Laughs)
- Bonnie Wheeler camera test.

12:38.817 --> 12:42.419
And we are rolling in five, four, three...

12:43.555 --> 12:46.723
Hello, everybody and welcome
to "The Mary Hart Show."

12:46.758 --> 12:49.560
I'm Mary Hart and this is my new co-host...

12:49.594 --> 12:51.862
- Bonnie Wheeler!
- Bonnie Wheeler. I'm supposed to say that.

12:53.631 --> 12:55.666
Bonnie is a newly-single mom.

12:55.700 --> 12:59.403
- She just moved here to...
- Who is definitely in the mood to mingle..

12:59.437 --> 13:01.638
with young people.

13:01.673 --> 13:03.674
Male people. Young male people.

13:03.708 --> 13:06.743
- Did I mention I was single?
- (Laughs)

13:06.778 --> 13:10.681
Oh, now that is a juicy story.

13:10.715 --> 13:13.484
It turns out my first husband was gay,

13:13.518 --> 13:16.386
which is why I'm making
sure my second one is rich.

13:16.421 --> 13:18.522
You know what I'm talking
about, right, Mary? Huh?

13:18.556 --> 13:20.457
(Laughs)

13:20.492 --> 13:23.192
(Deep voice): You know, Mary Hart.

13:24.529 --> 13:25.762
<i>- (Porter knocks)
- Mrs. Wheeler?</i>

13:25.797 --> 13:27.431
Yes, come in. Come in.

13:27.465 --> 13:28.832
Hi. Finally. Did you give Ben my note?

13:28.867 --> 13:30.734
- What took you so long?
- I'm sorry.

13:30.768 --> 13:33.737
I have this bad habit of taking
care of people who tip me first.

13:35.740 --> 13:37.407
Here here here.

13:37.442 --> 13:39.476
Relax. He'll be here any minute.

13:43.515 --> 13:45.849

(Yelps)

13:55.727 --> 13:57.594
Riley, hey, I got your...

13:57.629 --> 13:59.463
Riley?

13:59.497 --> 14:02.733
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah, I guess I just misunderstood.

14:02.767 --> 14:04.535
Then should we finish what we started?

14:04.569 --> 14:06.503
Yup, and if we do it right,

14:06.538 --> 14:08.539
tonight is going to be amazing.

14:12.510 --> 14:15.445
Oh, you have no idea

14:15.480 --> 14:17.581
how amazing it is going to be.

14:17.615 --> 14:18.815
Oh!

14:25.808 --> 14:28.675
(Snorts)

14:29.077 --> 14:31.412
And that is why you never mix

14:31.446 --> 14:34.015
box wine with rollerblades.

14:35.150 --> 14:36.417
True story.

14:36.451 --> 14:39.987
Oh! That looks like that is
all the time we have for today.

14:40.022 --> 14:42.356
For "The Mary Hart Show,"
I'm Bonnie Wheeler.

14:45.794 --> 14:48.061
- (Mutters)
- That's your cue.

14:49.331 --> 14:53.100
And she's Mary Hart! Good night, America!

14:53.135 --> 14:56.070
- (Laughs)
- Tucker: And we're out!

14:56.104 --> 14:57.405
- All right, great job, everyone.
- Right!

14:57.439 --> 15:01.075
Oh, that was amazing!
Oh, Mary, I just have to...

15:01.109 --> 15:03.177
- And Mary has to go. Run along now.
- Okay.

15:03.212 --> 15:06.380
- That woman is wild.
- Yes, I'm afraid so.

15:06.415 --> 15:08.983
- She never even looked at her cards.
- Not a one.

15:09.017 --> 15:11.953
- She totally winged it.
- Never knew what she was gonna say.

15:11.987 --> 15:14.121
- And I loved it!
- You what?

15:14.156 --> 15:16.090
It was invigorating.

15:16.124 --> 15:18.092
I mean, I should be more like Bonnie.

15:18.094 --> 15:19.393
I am so marrie to my cards

15:19.427 --> 15:21.996
- (Scoffs)
- But you love the cards.

15:22.030 --> 15:24.331
You know, actually, Mare-Mare,

15:24.366 --> 15:26.233
losing the cards was Tucker's idea.

15:26.268 --> 15:30.137
- He is a great producer.
- You know what? You're right.

15:30.171 --> 15:34.141
Congratulations, Tucker. I am
making you our new senior producer.

15:34.175 --> 15:37.077
Really? Oh my God, thank you.

15:37.112 --> 15:38.279
- (Gasps)
- I'm so sorry.

15:38.313 --> 15:41.248
And, Bonnie, you've got the job.

15:41.283 --> 15:43.384
- (Laughs)
- You can start on Monday.

15:43.418 --> 15:47.254
Oh! Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you, thank you.

15:47.289 --> 15:50.257
Oh, this is going to be so amazing.

15:50.292 --> 15:52.426
You will not regret this, Mary.

15:52.460 --> 15:55.162
Me and you, we're a team, you know?

15:55.196 --> 15:57.998
Like this fabulous mother and daughter act.

15:58.033 --> 15:59.333
You know?

15:59.367 --> 16:01.902
You're like the wise, old sage

16:01.936 --> 16:04.938
and I'm the young buck,
learning from the master.

16:04.973 --> 16:05.647
(Laughs)

16:05.649 --> 16:08.343
Oh, this is gonna be
so much fun, Mare bear.

16:08.376 --> 16:11.912
- Oh!
- (Laughing)

16:11.946 --> 16:15.082
- Where's...?
- (Continues laughing)

16:18.186 --> 16:21.388
So, as your new senior producer,

16:21.423 --> 16:23.357
is there anything I can do for you?

16:23.391 --> 16:26.991
Yes. You can fire Bonnie Wheeler.

16:27.025 --> 16:28.993
I hope it's not too awkward for you.

16:29.027 --> 16:31.162
(Chuckles)

16:31.196 --> 16:33.164
Oh, it won't be awkward at all.

16:35.133 --> 16:38.402
♪ Tucker puts the hart in Mary, Tucker. ♪

16:42.074 --> 16:44.175
So, would you like me to pour?

16:44.209 --> 16:45.309
Can't drink if you don't pour.

16:46.378 --> 16:48.279
- (Scoffs)
- Really?

16:48.313 --> 16:51.148
Really? Candles, wine,

16:51.183 --> 16:54.151
a girl who's name I'm sure
you've just already forgotten.

16:54.186 --> 16:56.287
- It's Samantha.
- It's irrelevant.

16:56.321 --> 16:59.090
Riley, are you okay? What happened to you?

16:59.124 --> 17:02.293
You! You! You happened to me. That's what.

17:02.327 --> 17:06.063
And don't even try to tell me
that this isn't what it looks like,

17:06.098 --> 17:08.299
because if you say that this
isn't what it looks like,

17:08.333 --> 17:12.269
I will scream, and we all know
just exactly what that looks like.

17:12.304 --> 17:14.171
Me screaming!

17:16.174 --> 17:18.108
Okay, Riley, you need to calm down.

17:18.143 --> 17:19.377
Oh my God! I am calm, okay?

17:19.411 --> 17:22.946
I am as calm as a cucumber.

17:22.981 --> 17:24.281
I'm pretty sure that's "cool as a..."

17:24.316 --> 17:25.915
Oh, stuff it, Liquor Lady!

17:27.185 --> 17:30.221
I can't believe that I was
about to throw myself at you!

17:30.255 --> 17:33.290
I was... I was willing to
give us another chance!

17:33.325 --> 17:36.193
We were gonna have sex.

17:38.230 --> 17:40.064
Hey, can I get this dinner to go?

17:40.098 --> 17:42.299
- (Scoffs)
- Oh. Oh, sure.

17:42.334 --> 17:44.935
Let me pack this up for you.

17:47.239 --> 17:49.140
- Ha!
- (Laughs)

17:49.174 --> 17:52.143
What do you think of that?

17:52.210 --> 17:54.311
I think you're gonna feel really silly

17:54.346 --> 17:55.980
when I tell you who that dinner was for.

17:56.014 --> 17:58.983
I didn't do all of this for
some waitress I just met.

17:59.017 --> 18:00.918
Actually, I'm a bartender.

18:00.952 --> 18:03.254
Oh, Sweetie, nobody cares.

18:06.992 --> 18:09.060
I did this for you.

18:09.094 --> 18:12.029
And I just want you to know that no
matter how many times you turn me down,

18:12.064 --> 18:13.964
I'm still gonna be here waiting.

18:13.999 --> 18:17.201
Riley, you are the only one for me.

18:20.939 --> 18:22.173
Oh.

18:24.209 --> 18:27.044
- (Chuckles)
- Why didn't you say so?

18:28.380 --> 18:30.247
(Clears throat)

18:31.316 --> 18:33.217
I'll have a white wine.

18:35.187 --> 18:38.989
I guarantee this is gonna be
the best lasagna you've ever had.

18:39.024 --> 18:40.958
And fair warning,

18:40.992 --> 18:42.126
I still cannot find my watch,

18:42.160 --> 18:43.194
so eat carefully.

18:43.228 --> 18:45.296
Here you go.

18:45.330 --> 18:48.065
Ah. Just because one girl had to cancel

18:48.100 --> 18:50.334
doesn't mean I can't have
dinner with my other best girl.

18:50.368 --> 18:52.336
- (Fusses)
- Don't tell Georgie,

18:52.370 --> 18:55.139
<i>- but you really are my favorite.
- (Door opens).</i>

18:55.173 --> 18:59.877
Okay, that was officially
the worst day ever.

18:59.911 --> 19:02.046
Oh, I don't know. It wasn't so bad.

19:02.080 --> 19:04.248
- (Chuckles)
- Ooh, lasagna.

19:04.282 --> 19:07.952
- Help yourself.
- Oh, that Mary Hart.

19:07.986 --> 19:10.154
You know, she seems so sweet and innocent.

19:10.188 --> 19:12.890
Don't let her fool you. She is evil.

19:13.925 --> 19:16.327
She had the nerve to hire and fire me

19:16.361 --> 19:19.063
on the same day. Oh, and get this...

19:19.097 --> 19:22.967
She made poor Tucker here
do her dirty work for her.

19:23.001 --> 19:24.068
It was awful.

19:26.037 --> 19:28.239
Well, I hope you like it.

19:28.273 --> 19:29.373
It's the first thing I've ever made.

19:29.407 --> 19:32.771
Oh my God, Honey, it smells incredible.

19:32.806 --> 19:36.307
- Uh. Mm-oh my... tastes...
- (Gasps)

19:37.041 --> 19:39.109
(Both gag)

19:39.143 --> 19:41.177
- Oh my God!
- Move!

19:41.212 --> 19:43.079
- Move! You move!
- Oh God, I can still taste it!

19:50.254 --> 19:53.924
Oh my God, it's starting to get light.

19:53.958 --> 19:56.393
I can't believe we stayed
up all night just... talking.

19:56.427 --> 19:59.195
I know. That's a first for me.

19:59.230 --> 20:00.964
(Laughs)

20:00.998 --> 20:03.400
So, I think we got this friend thing down.

20:03.434 --> 20:05.368
What do you say we go
back up to the compartment

20:05.403 --> 20:07.003
