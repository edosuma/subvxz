WEBVTT

00:10.146 --> 00:12.979
Oh, did I mention, two members
of my fear-of-commitment group

00:13.146 --> 00:14.625
have announced
they're getting married.

00:14.786 --> 00:16.378
Oh, congratulations.

00:16.546 --> 00:18.901
There's a downside, though.
They're New Age types.

00:19.066 --> 00:21.057
The wedding is to be
held in the woods.

00:21.226 --> 00:23.535
- So?
- I need a date.

00:23.706 --> 00:26.504
You know how the women
in my crowd tend to droop outdoors.

00:28.066 --> 00:31.979
Yes, well, Niles, there are all different
sorts of women in the world, you know.

00:32.426 --> 00:35.224
Perhaps if you'd tiptoe beyond
the fringes of your precious circle,

00:35.386 --> 00:36.899
cast a wider net.

00:37.226 --> 00:40.616
Frasier, that woman by the side
of the road spearing trash...

00:42.026 --> 00:43.300
Not that wide.

00:43.466 --> 00:45.855
No, no, no, it's Roz.

00:46.546 --> 00:48.423
My God, it is.

00:53.106 --> 00:55.700
If she realizes we've recognized her,
she'll be utterly humiliated.

00:55.866 --> 00:57.936
Oh, Roz?

00:59.066 --> 01:01.660
Oh, my God.
You're not seeing me. Go away.

01:01.826 --> 01:03.817
Roz, what on earth
are you doing here?

01:04.546 --> 01:05.865
Just let me in.

01:06.066 --> 01:07.738
- Wait, I'll spread papers.
- Oh, yes.

01:08.626 --> 01:10.537
FRASIER:
Thank you, Niles.

01:11.346 --> 01:12.495
All right.

01:13.546 --> 01:14.695
Okay, let's go.

01:14.906 --> 01:16.339
What...? What do you mean
"let's go"?

01:16.506 --> 01:18.815
L... I can't do that.
I don't even know why you're here.

01:19.346 --> 01:23.259
About a month ago, I got stopped
doing 60 in a 30-mile-an-hour zone.

01:23.586 --> 01:26.259
It was either a huge fine
or community service.

01:26.546 --> 01:28.980
So here I am,
and it's a nightmare.

01:29.146 --> 01:34.539
Breathing exhaust fumes,
using a spatula to scrape up roadkill.

01:35.626 --> 01:37.298
Well, at least just look
on the bright side.

01:37.466 --> 01:39.104
You're outdoors.
You can enjoy nature.

01:39.266 --> 01:41.860
- You're beautifying our highways...
- Frasier, I found an ear.

01:43.626 --> 01:45.537
Was there no other service
you could've performed?

01:45.706 --> 01:48.459
The only other option was visiting
old people in a retirement home.

01:48.626 --> 01:49.820
And you chose this?

01:49.986 --> 01:52.136
Think about it:
Walking the streets, picking up trash...

01:52.306 --> 01:54.103
You can see how Roz
would go with the familiar.

01:54.346 --> 01:55.495
Niles.

01:56.946 --> 01:58.982
Old people just make me
uncomfortable.

01:59.186 --> 02:01.905
Roz, have you ever considered that
your discomfort around the elderly

02:02.066 --> 02:03.738
may stem from your own fear
of growing old?

02:03.946 --> 02:05.504
Wow! Do you think?

02:07.666 --> 02:08.781
Oh, my God.

02:08.946 --> 02:10.857
- What?
- It's my supervisor. Hit the gas.

02:11.066 --> 02:14.945
- I can't. It might be illegal.
- Move or your brother gets it.

02:15.146 --> 02:18.138
- Absolutely not.
- All right, the headrest.

02:18.346 --> 02:20.177
Off we go.

02:25.466 --> 02:26.865
[GRUNTING]

02:28.226 --> 02:30.581
Oh, well, Dad, doing your exercises.
Very good.

02:30.786 --> 02:32.742
DAPHNE:
Just a little farther.

02:32.906 --> 02:34.339
There you go.

02:34.506 --> 02:36.303
Congratulations, Mr Crane.

02:36.506 --> 02:38.417
You finally got your knee
past your rib cage.

02:38.626 --> 02:40.184
It's no big deal.

02:40.386 --> 02:43.184
Well, it's more than Lilith could
accomplish in five years of marriage.

02:45.906 --> 02:49.262
You know, it's so gratifying to see your
father make these little improvements.

02:49.466 --> 02:51.582
It's days like this when I'm glad
I took this position.

02:51.786 --> 02:54.300
We're all glad you took this position.

02:55.186 --> 02:57.575
You know, Daphne, I must say,
there are some times I envy you.

02:57.746 --> 02:59.702
Here you go, Niles.

03:03.786 --> 03:06.619
You know, I'll just say
that it's always gratifying

03:06.786 --> 03:08.663
to see some reward for your efforts.

03:08.826 --> 03:11.056
Lately, that's something I've been
lacking in my own work.

03:11.266 --> 03:12.665
NILES: How so?
- Oh, well, you know,

03:12.826 --> 03:16.660
back in private practice I could spend
months, even years with a patient,

03:16.866 --> 03:18.265
see the fruits of my labour.

03:18.426 --> 03:20.018
Now, somebody calls in,
I give my advice

03:20.186 --> 03:22.302
and never know how things work out.

03:22.506 --> 03:24.576
I simply release my humble words
in the airwaves,

03:24.746 --> 03:26.259
and then they're gone forever,
vanished.

03:26.426 --> 03:28.144
So like my Tiffany cuff links.

03:29.946 --> 03:32.585
I'd hoped to wear them to my New Age
wedding. They've disappeared.

03:32.786 --> 03:34.617
So you know my pain.

03:38.146 --> 03:40.455
Well, I'm not really dissatisfied.
It's just that... Well,

03:40.626 --> 03:42.856
Daphne, you know, you get to see
your progress with Dad.

03:43.066 --> 03:45.739
Niles, you have the upcoming marriage
of your commitment-phobics.

03:45.906 --> 03:47.578
Oh, come on.
You help people all the time.

03:47.746 --> 03:49.862
- You helped me just the other day.
- How?

03:50.026 --> 03:52.620
Well, I was worried because Eddie
had lost his appetite,

03:52.786 --> 03:54.139
and you remember what you said?

03:54.306 --> 03:55.500
If I remember rightly, I said,

03:55.666 --> 03:58.260
"Well, why don't you just give him
some of my truffle foie gras."

03:58.426 --> 03:59.541
Right.

03:59.706 --> 04:00.900
I was being funny.

04:01.706 --> 04:02.900
Oh.

04:03.066 --> 04:07.059
Yeah, well, I knew that.
That just cheered me right up.

04:07.266 --> 04:08.779
Come on, Eddie.

04:18.266 --> 04:21.622
- Excuse me, Bulldog.
- What's up, doc?

04:22.026 --> 04:23.220
Listen, have you seen Roz?

04:23.386 --> 04:24.978
She's late. My show goes on
in 30 seconds.

04:25.146 --> 04:26.579
You know what? I'd dump her.

04:26.786 --> 04:28.265
A little extreme, don't you think?

04:28.466 --> 04:31.219
I fire everybody once a year.
Housekeepers, personal trainers.

04:31.426 --> 04:33.621
Cut them off before they start
copping an attitude.

04:33.786 --> 04:35.583
Oh, oh, doctors are the worst of all.

04:35.786 --> 04:37.697
You pick up the same disease
three or four times,

04:37.866 --> 04:40.016
they start lecturing you
like it's your fault.

04:41.026 --> 04:42.584
You want a bite?

04:42.746 --> 04:45.419
Not if you skipped it to me
across a pool of disinfectant.

04:51.066 --> 04:54.297
Hello, Seattle. Good afternoon.
This is Dr Frasier Crane.

04:54.506 --> 04:56.781
Today we're gonna do things
just a little bit different.

04:56.946 --> 04:58.220
For the past four years now,

04:58.386 --> 05:00.138
I've been taking your calls
and giving advice.

05:00.306 --> 05:01.455
And I was thinking,

05:01.626 --> 05:03.821
perhaps our listeners wonder
how things have turned out.

05:03.986 --> 05:05.135
I know I do.

05:05.306 --> 05:07.900
So today I invite those of you
who've called in in the past

05:08.066 --> 05:09.704
to give us a holler,

05:09.866 --> 05:12.141
and we can catch up on
how things have worked out for you.

05:12.346 --> 05:14.462
All our lines are open.

05:20.186 --> 05:21.824
Come on.

05:21.986 --> 05:23.977
Come on, you know the number.

05:24.306 --> 05:26.342
There we are.

05:26.626 --> 05:31.780
Hello, this is Dr Frasier Crane.
How did I help you?

05:33.026 --> 05:35.665
<i>CHET: Hello, Dr Crane.
This is Chet from Whidbey Island.</i>

05:35.826 --> 05:37.464
<i>I gave you a call last year.</i>

05:37.666 --> 05:40.817
<i>I was having problems
with low self-esteem.</i>

05:40.986 --> 05:43.819
I see. And did my advice help you
to become more assertive?

05:43.986 --> 05:47.774
<i>CHET: Damn straight. Yeah, now
people say I'm downright arrogant.</i>

05:48.546 --> 05:51.458
<i>Well, you know what I say?
Screw them.</i>

05:53.626 --> 05:57.858
Well, perhaps you took my advice
just a bit too far.

05:58.026 --> 06:00.460
<i>CHET:
Who the hell are you?</i>

06:01.426 --> 06:03.735
<i>Screw you too.</i>

06:05.186 --> 06:08.622
Well, as I give myself
a well-deserved pat on the back

06:09.386 --> 06:12.184
and Chet marches off
to invade Poland,

06:12.346 --> 06:14.576
let's just go to commercial.

06:15.786 --> 06:17.139
Well, Roz, glad you could join us.

06:17.306 --> 06:18.785
You're lucky I made it at all.

06:19.426 --> 06:21.576
I took your advice and went down
to that retirement home

06:21.746 --> 06:23.099
to finish off my community service.

06:23.306 --> 06:25.262
It's a lot better than spearing trash,
isn't it?

06:25.426 --> 06:26.654
You tell me.

06:26.826 --> 06:29.579
I started playing checkers
with this old man, Mr Krantz.

06:29.746 --> 06:32.499
Well, things got a little competitive,
and he made a really bad move,

06:32.666 --> 06:34.896
and I said, "You're a dead man."

06:38.306 --> 06:41.503
Oh, dear. I think I see where
this story's headed.

06:41.706 --> 06:44.095
A minute later, he's lying
sprawled across the board.

06:44.266 --> 06:46.302
Pieces are everywhere.
The whole place is screaming.

06:46.466 --> 06:49.902
When I pulled him up, he still had
a checker stuck to his forehead.

06:50.066 --> 06:52.421
Roz, I am so sorry, I...

06:52.586 --> 06:54.861
Jeez, I can see how you could be
very traumatized by this.

06:55.066 --> 06:57.580
Hi, we're back. That was
a catchy little commercial, wasn't it?

06:57.746 --> 06:59.020
Let's get back to it.

07:00.826 --> 07:02.737
Roz, listen, you can't be
too upset about this.

07:02.906 --> 07:05.340
Now, given the circumstances,
his age, and his surroundings,

07:05.506 --> 07:08.259
I mean, surely this thing
was sort of expected.

07:08.466 --> 07:09.819
Not with this guy.

07:09.986 --> 07:13.103
The whole reason I liked him was
he was so youthful and robust.

07:13.546 --> 07:15.821
You should have seen him, Frasier.
He was raring to go.

07:15.986 --> 07:18.022
He kept bragging
about how good he was

07:18.226 --> 07:19.500
and how much fun
it was gonna be.

07:19.666 --> 07:20.940
Then he dies on me.

07:21.146 --> 07:23.865
- Hey, it happens to all guys, okay?
- Bulldog.

07:24.026 --> 07:26.335
No, no, no, this is a pet peeve
of mine, doc.

07:26.506 --> 07:27.985
Why is it always the guy's fault?

07:28.186 --> 07:30.746
If you chicks needed a little less booze
to get from maybe to yes,

07:30.906 --> 07:33.898
we'd be a lot more alert
when the moment of truth arrives.

07:35.106 --> 07:39.782
Bulldog, Roz was playing checkers
with an elderly gentleman, and he died.

07:39.986 --> 07:41.658
Oh, well...

07:44.106 --> 07:47.143
Well, when I said we, I didn't mean me,
because I don't have that.

07:50.706 --> 07:52.583
Hey, you're a doctor.
That was confidential.

07:53.586 --> 07:56.419
Well, I guess its back
to scraping up roadkill.

07:56.586 --> 07:59.054
FRASIER: Surely you realize what
happened at the retirement home

07:59.226 --> 08:01.057
- was an aberration.
- Well, maybe so.

08:01.266 --> 08:03.700
But I wasn't comfortable being around
old people to begin with,

08:03.866 --> 08:05.060
and this hasn't helped matters.

08:05.226 --> 08:07.694
Roz, listen, if you're ever going
to conquer your fear of aging,

08:07.866 --> 08:10.141
get back down there and spend
some time with these people.

08:10.306 --> 08:12.740
You'll learn that they're really
vital human beings.

08:12.906 --> 08:15.466
- I'm still not convinced.
- All right, then think of it this way:

08:15.946 --> 08:17.902
There's been a lot of fog
on the interstate lately,

08:18.066 --> 08:20.455
and the caribou are migrating.

08:24.186 --> 08:27.815
"As the train whistle screamed
and we started out of the station,

08:27.986 --> 08:31.456
I lowered the window and said,
'I'll be back.'

08:31.626 --> 08:36.859
But somehow I knew
I would never see her or Paris again.

08:37.025 --> 08:38.618
The end."

08:38.785 --> 08:41.744
That was a pretty good book,
wasn't it, Mr Gouldenstein?

08:41.905 --> 08:44.784
Mr Gouldenstein,
you're feeling a little cold.

08:44.946 --> 08:46.618
Can I make you a nice hot cup of...

08:46.786 --> 08:48.902
Oh, my God!

08:55.426 --> 08:56.984
Come on, boy. You can do it.
Come on.

[DOORBELL RINGS]

08:58.466 --> 09:00.616
Hey, hey. Hey, Fras, look at that.
He's dancing.

09:00.826 --> 09:02.657
- He's practically doing a polka.
FRASIER: Good.

09:02.866 --> 09:06.017
That should up his price
when I sell him to the carnival.

09:06.986 --> 09:08.465
DAPHNE: Hello.
- Hello, Daphne.

09:08.626 --> 09:10.423
Back from the big wedding
in the woods, huh?

09:10.626 --> 09:12.025
Oh, yes, and don't you look nice.

09:12.186 --> 09:14.620
Except, what's this sticky stuff
all over your shoulder here?

09:14.826 --> 09:16.862
- Did you finally find a date?
- I asked Maris.

09:17.026 --> 09:19.540
- Sap.
- I think Daphne speaks for us all.

09:21.306 --> 09:24.104
- Just how the hell did this happen?
- Well, I was desperate for a date,

09:24.266 --> 09:26.222
and I knew Maris would be
lonely this time of year.

09:26.386 --> 09:29.423
It's cruise season. She never partakes.
She has an absolute terror of buffets.

09:29.586 --> 09:33.215
Oh, yes, her legendary
"smorgaphobia."

09:34.146 --> 09:36.296
So how did it go?
Or how big a scene did she make?

09:36.506 --> 09:38.224
Actually, she did quite well.

09:38.386 --> 09:41.059
She willingly joined in
the ceremonial chanting,

09:41.266 --> 09:44.656
and when the shaman invited those so
inclined to embrace their favourite tree,

09:44.826 --> 09:48.262
Maris said the only tree she was willing
to embrace was her family tree.

09:49.506 --> 09:50.859
Everyone laughed.

09:51.186 --> 09:52.938
Well, I laughed.

09:54.586 --> 09:56.258
Then it happened.

09:56.466 --> 09:59.344
- They called for a group hug.
- Oh, dear.

09:59.786 --> 10:02.175
Last time I saw her,
she was racing toward her Mercedes,

10:02.346 --> 10:03.665
emitting a high-pitched shriek

10:03.826 --> 10:06.579
that caused the wedding doves
to attack one another.

[DOORBELL RINGS]

I'll see if I can find something
to remove this sap.

10:12.786 --> 10:15.459
- Another one died.
FRASIER: What? What happened?

10:15.666 --> 10:16.894
What's she talking about?

10:17.146 --> 10:19.501
Dad, Roz has been doing some
community service

10:19.666 --> 10:21.304
down at a retirement home,

10:21.466 --> 10:23.218
and apparently,
for the second time this week,

10:23.386 --> 10:24.580
one of her charges has died.

They're calling me
the Angel of Death now.

Maybe it is.

10:32.946 --> 10:34.823
I've never been good
with plants or animals.

10:34.986 --> 10:36.339
Everything's always died on me.

10:36.506 --> 10:38.497
You have a cat.

10:39.306 --> 10:40.534
Oh.

10:41.386 --> 10:43.263
I'm so sorry.

10:43.586 --> 10:47.295
Roz, death is an occupational hazard
of working with older people.

10:47.506 --> 10:50.145
Trust me, I've lost more patients
than I'd like to count.

10:50.306 --> 10:51.944
You never said anything
about that to me.

10:52.106 --> 10:55.462
Didn't I? Anyway, you just sit there,
and I'll go make you a nice cup of tea.

10:55.626 --> 10:57.423
MARTIN: Wait,
how many patients did you lose?

10:57.586 --> 10:58.814
DAPHNE:
Well, I don't know.

10:58.986 --> 11:01.454
I used to keep a tally in me diary,
but it made me a bit sad.

11:01.626 --> 11:03.821
Was it more than five?

11:04.506 --> 11:08.419
Now listen, Roz, there's no way
that you can feel guilty about this.

11:08.586 --> 11:10.099
I mean, those men
were gonna die anyway,

11:10.266 --> 11:12.496
and you gave them
some much welcomed companionship

11:12.666 --> 11:14.019
in their final moments.

11:14.306 --> 11:16.103
It just seems so unfair.

11:16.826 --> 11:20.535
One minute he's lying in the bed,
smiling and happy,

11:21.146 --> 11:23.785
and ten seconds later it's over.

11:24.906 --> 11:28.376
For heaven's sake, it happens to
every man a couple of times in his life.

11:28.546 --> 11:31.697
Why can't you women
just take it as a compliment?

11:38.386 --> 11:40.217
Look, I appreciate you coming
down here with me,

11:40.386 --> 11:41.705
but I don't think I can make it.

11:41.866 --> 11:44.664
Roz, we have discussed this. This is
going to be your breakthrough day.

11:44.826 --> 11:46.703
- They hate me here.
- You're just overreacting.

11:46.866 --> 11:48.857
There's no way they think you're
the Angel of Death.

11:52.106 --> 11:55.815
- I'm leaving.
- No, Roz, this is not like you.

11:55.986 --> 11:58.022
The Roz I know is not a quitter.
She's a fighter.

11:58.186 --> 12:00.495
I just can't help thinking
it's going to happen again.

12:00.666 --> 12:01.940
They always die in threes.

Just get... Just get in there.

12:13.026 --> 12:17.144
- Hi, I'm Roz.
- I'm Moira. Come in.

12:17.346 --> 12:18.904
- How are you feeling today?
- Fine.

12:19.066 --> 12:20.385
- Really? Do you feel okay?
- Yes.

12:20.546 --> 12:23.299
Now, do me a favour and hand me
those cigarettes, would you?

12:25.986 --> 12:27.783
You know, these things
do come with a warning.

12:27.986 --> 12:29.897
So do you, darling. I let you in.

Good afternoon. How you doing?

- Yes.

12:43.466 --> 12:46.185
- Have we met?
- No, but I thought that was you.

12:46.346 --> 12:48.257
I recognise your voice
from the radio.

12:48.466 --> 12:50.263
I listen to your program all the time.

12:50.426 --> 12:51.620
Norman Royster.

12:51.786 --> 12:54.425
Well, it's my pleasure.

12:54.626 --> 12:55.820
Are you here visiting somebody?

12:55.986 --> 12:57.738
No, I'm just here with
a friend of mine, Roz.

12:57.906 --> 13:01.216
- She's doing some community service.
- Oh, the Angel of Death. Nice gal.

13:03.586 --> 13:07.818
You know, I remember one day
I was listening to your program,

13:07.986 --> 13:09.738
and it was right after my wife died,

13:09.906 --> 13:12.056
and I was going through
kind of a rough patch...

13:12.226 --> 13:14.376
You told this guy who was going
through the same thing

13:14.546 --> 13:17.822
that he should keep pictures of his wife
around to help with the transition.

13:17.986 --> 13:19.180
That was a good idea.

13:19.386 --> 13:21.263
So you started keeping pictures
with you?

13:21.466 --> 13:24.026
Well, that wouldn't make much sense,
now would it?

13:24.226 --> 13:25.978
Well, no. Well, what did you do?

13:26.146 --> 13:28.614
Well, I remembered,
when we were dating,

13:28.786 --> 13:32.335
Helen made this life mask
of herself for art class,

13:32.506 --> 13:34.656
and I had my daughter
dig through the attic,

13:34.826 --> 13:38.262
and, lo and behold, she found it.

13:39.066 --> 13:42.024
This is the way she looked
when we met.

13:42.186 --> 13:44.142
- Isn't she beautiful?
- Oh, yes.

So you were right.

13:45.786 --> 13:47.697
Every night, before I fall asleep,

13:47.866 --> 13:49.822
I run my fingers over Helen's
beautiful face,

13:49.986 --> 13:52.739
and it takes me back to all those
wonderful years we had together.

13:53.386 --> 13:55.741
It made a world of difference.

13:56.066 --> 13:58.785
I wanna thank you.
You really helped me.

to hear that.

one of my many pills.

14:30.866 --> 14:34.142
- What was that?
- Nothing. Nothing.

14:34.306 --> 14:37.264
- I just knocked your ashtray over.
- Well, I hope it wasn't damaged.

14:37.426 --> 14:39.223
My grandson made that for me
at summer camp.

14:39.386 --> 14:41.820
Oh, no, it's intact.
Not the tiniest chip.

14:41.986 --> 14:44.625
Oh, good. Set it back on the table.

14:44.826 --> 14:47.704
You know how attached you get
to family things.

14:47.866 --> 14:51.541
- Do you have children, Dr Crane?
- Well, yes.

14:51.746 --> 14:53.304
Dr Crane, are you on the floor?

14:54.226 --> 14:56.217
I was just tying my shoelace.

14:56.986 --> 15:00.456
Yes, yes, I have a son.
I'd much rather hear about your family.

15:00.666 --> 15:02.941
Well, I got four sons
and one daughter.

15:03.106 --> 15:06.223
You wouldn't happen to be single now
by any chance, would you, Dr Crane?

15:06.386 --> 15:08.456
As a matter of fact, I am.

15:09.666 --> 15:12.419
So is my daughter.
I'll tell you about her first.

15:12.586 --> 15:14.702
She's a sweet thing. Beautiful too.

15:14.866 --> 15:19.656
Just like her mother.
Same cheekbones, same nose.

15:22.186 --> 15:25.303
And what a lovely nose it is.

15:26.386 --> 15:30.015
So there are four of us in the raft,

15:30.346 --> 15:32.780
and I see we're heading
into a patch of white water.

15:32.986 --> 15:36.376
Suddenly, we slam into a rock,
and the next thing I know,

15:36.586 --> 15:38.941
my teeth are flying
into the Colorado River.

15:40.146 --> 15:41.977
I damned near dived in after them.

15:42.146 --> 15:44.979
Those teeth cost more
than the whole trip.

15:46.466 --> 15:49.105
- You've had quite a life.
- I suppose.

15:49.306 --> 15:53.504
Never got arrested, though.
Oh, good for you.

15:54.106 --> 15:55.425
It wasn't so great.

15:55.586 --> 15:57.736
You know, it was the first time
I ever got pulled over

15:57.906 --> 15:59.737
and couldn't flirt my way past it.

15:59.946 --> 16:03.939
Oh, that's almost as bad as the first
time somebody calls you ma'am.

16:04.146 --> 16:06.102
That happened the other day.

And every morning,
I open my eyes,

16:23.906 --> 16:26.136
and I see the sun
streaming through the window.

16:26.506 --> 16:28.542
I hear the birds chirping.

16:28.746 --> 16:30.941
I smell the coffee brewing
down the hall.

16:31.106 --> 16:35.622

and I look into the mirror.

around her waist.

any better, Moira.

Nobody likes to get older, but it
doesn't mean you can't enjoy yourself.

17:27.586 --> 17:31.818
Last Thursday, I hacked into
the main computer here

17:31.986 --> 17:33.817
and changed the schedule.

17:33.986 --> 17:39.185
So now I get all my sponge baths
from Eduardo.

17:42.426 --> 17:43.779
You're kidding me.

17:43.986 --> 17:46.261
Look, you're way too young
to be concerned about all this.

Don't waste the best years of your life

you can't control.

17:50.746 --> 17:53.135
I know. I know you're right.

17:53.306 --> 17:55.866
You know, I wouldn't care about
getting older if I thought my mind

17:56.026 --> 17:57.379

as yours is.

the main computer here

18:04.826 --> 18:06.339

to watch Willie Mays steal second,

any glue around here?

I don't think so. Why?

18:29.226 --> 18:31.786
Well, the onyx
has popped out of my cuff link,

I might be able to reaffix it.

- Yes.

Yes, you know,

18:51.586 --> 18:53.497
You know,
the worst part about all this

18:53.706 --> 18:55.936
is I used to be the kind of person
who never got tired.

18:56.146 --> 18:58.660
Well, you know, then, perhaps maybe
we should take a brisk walk.

18:58.826 --> 19:01.340
- Get that old circulation going.
- No, that's okay.

Come in.

an Avon lady before she lost her mind.

- My pleasure.

19:53.986 --> 19:55.305
Oh, you're over there.

19:55.466 --> 19:58.583
Well, yeah, I was just having
one last look at Helen.

- I sure will.

Norman...

20:33.066 --> 20:35.296
...I have a little confession
to make.

20:35.746 --> 20:37.464
I didn't...

20:37.626 --> 20:40.015
I didn't drop your ashtray.
I dropped the mask.

Oh, that's why you needed
my denture adhesive.

20:46.226 --> 20:48.217
- Yes.
- Well, usually it works pretty well.

20:48.426 --> 20:50.940
I must've dropped that mask ten times.

I am blind, you know.

20:57.746 --> 20:59.259
Certainly is a relief to hear that.

here before I do any further damage.
