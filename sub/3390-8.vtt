00:59.166 --> 01:01.100
Hyun-jun, who was preparing
for revenge, is arrested

01:01.166 --> 01:03.133
and interrogated
by the Japanese Intelligence Office.

01:04.833 --> 01:05.700
He accepts an offer

01:05.866 --> 01:08.033
to kill a Japanese mafia boss
in exchange for his freedom

01:08.200 --> 01:09.800
and disappears after killing him.

01:18.666 --> 01:19.633
The President invites

01:19.933 --> 01:22.700
a North Korean high-ranking official
to the country and meets him in secret.

01:28.200 --> 01:30.066
The NSS, excluded
from the event, struggles

01:30.533 --> 01:32.100
to figure out the situation.

01:37.400 --> 01:39.833
Hyun-jun, who was trying
to smuggle himself into Korea,

01:40.733 --> 01:42.233
receives a call from Vick,

01:42.566 --> 01:44.300
demanding Seung-ryong Hong's belonging.

01:58.466 --> 01:59.933
EPISODE 8

02:25.733 --> 02:26.700
Stop.

02:29.733 --> 02:30.766
Mister.

02:31.133 --> 02:32.333
Yuki, are you okay?

02:32.566 --> 02:34.733
Don't be afraid. Everything will be okay.

02:37.133 --> 02:38.133
Drop your gun.

02:43.400 --> 02:44.266
USB drive.

02:44.533 --> 02:45.400
Let the girl go first.

03:18.666 --> 03:19.533
Password.

03:27.333 --> 03:28.733
SH0615

04:05.266 --> 04:06.366
Keep your head down.

05:29.433 --> 05:30.300
Yuki.

05:32.833 --> 05:34.633
Don't worry. It's all over now.

05:35.433 --> 05:36.266
Dad...

05:38.133 --> 05:39.066
Mom...

05:40.366 --> 05:41.400
Mom...

07:59.066 --> 08:00.666
HOT SPRINGS HOTEL

08:07.433 --> 08:09.033
Yuki, are you okay?

08:11.433 --> 08:12.366
Yuki.

08:16.566 --> 08:17.500
Yuki.

08:19.966 --> 08:20.866
Yuki!

08:22.133 --> 08:23.000
Yuki!

08:27.300 --> 08:29.266
Yuki. Yuki!

08:53.833 --> 08:54.900
Yuki, Yuki!

08:56.566 --> 08:57.866
Yuki, Yuki!

08:58.500 --> 08:59.433
Yuki!

09:04.600 --> 09:06.466
Yuki... Yuki.

09:06.933 --> 09:08.200
Wake up, Yuki!

09:08.333 --> 09:09.200
Yuki!

09:09.466 --> 09:11.100
Yuki, wake up!

09:11.233 --> 09:12.266
Yuki...

09:14.333 --> 09:15.200
Yuki.

09:22.233 --> 09:23.133
Yuki...

09:41.766 --> 09:44.133
The girl who glowed like a field in spring

10:58.133 --> 10:59.066
It's me.

10:59.400 --> 11:00.666
It's been a while.

11:03.466 --> 11:04.733
I need your help.

11:05.233 --> 11:06.866
You left after rejecting me,

11:07.566 --> 11:09.366
but now you want me to help you again?

11:12.166 --> 11:13.166
Tell me what it is.

11:14.666 --> 11:17.133
I don't know what they want from me.

11:19.766 --> 11:22.033
They said it's something
that I received from Seung-ryong Hong.

11:22.133 --> 11:23.033
That something...

11:23.100 --> 11:24.533
You have it.

11:25.700 --> 11:26.566
After you find it,

11:26.633 --> 11:27.800
call me back.

11:47.600 --> 11:48.500
Take this with you.

11:50.433 --> 11:51.333
Even if you did,

11:51.666 --> 11:52.933
you wouldn't lose anything.

11:54.400 --> 11:55.566
Are you giving this to me?

11:57.166 --> 11:58.033
Thank you.

11:58.400 --> 11:59.566
It's so pretty.

12:03.066 --> 12:03.933
Mister!

12:05.900 --> 12:07.533
I wear this every day,

12:07.600 --> 12:09.633
thinking of you, Mr. Hyun-jun.

12:18.566 --> 12:21.566
The girl who glowed like a field in spring

12:29.866 --> 12:32.400
The girl who glowed like a field in spring

14:16.200 --> 14:20.200
Mortal Mischief

14:38.533 --> 14:40.500
Sergeant Hyun-jun Kim's Espionage

14:40.633 --> 14:42.600
Hyun-jun Kim Wanted by Interpol for Murder

15:11.933 --> 15:12.966
About a month ago,

15:13.966 --> 15:15.700
you know we had guests
from the North, right?

15:17.500 --> 15:21.166
Yes. I know
that a high-ranking official came.

15:22.166 --> 15:23.600
Throughout the process,

15:24.600 --> 15:27.166
the NSS was completely excluded.

15:29.666 --> 15:31.333
It's unprecedented
that the NSS was excluded

15:32.000 --> 15:33.433
in such an important event

15:34.033 --> 15:35.166
between South and North Korea.

15:36.766 --> 15:39.266
Because I can't figure out

15:40.000 --> 15:42.200
why the president excluded us,
I'm confused.

15:43.933 --> 15:46.433
Wouldn't it be the aftereffect
of the Hungary incident?

15:47.066 --> 15:48.000
Well...

15:49.700 --> 15:50.900
Even allowing for that,

15:52.033 --> 15:56.066
the fact that the president doesn't trust
the NSS is pretty disturbing.

16:01.100 --> 16:03.200
I've talked silly stuff to you.

16:06.033 --> 16:07.266
The reason why I called you is

16:09.600 --> 16:10.833
to talk about Seung-hee Choi.

16:13.033 --> 16:14.433
She needs to return to her position.

16:18.100 --> 16:20.133
I don't think it'll be easy.

16:22.633 --> 16:23.533
Why?

16:26.233 --> 16:27.300
She doesn't believe

16:27.666 --> 16:28.966
that Hyun-jun's dead.

16:30.833 --> 16:32.266
In her current state of mind,

16:34.966 --> 16:36.633
I don't think
she'll return to her position.

16:38.533 --> 16:39.666
If she doesn't believe,

16:40.400 --> 16:41.466
make her believe it.

16:46.666 --> 16:47.833
That's your mission.

16:59.800 --> 17:00.866
If she doesn't believe,

17:01.933 --> 17:03.033
make her believe it.

17:04.833 --> 17:05.933
That's your mission.

18:17.066 --> 18:18.033
Oh...

18:18.700 --> 18:21.500
We'll have an emergency meeting
chaired by the director at 9:30 a.m.

18:22.433 --> 18:26.100
Bring documents
from overseas intelligence agencies.

18:26.500 --> 18:27.400
Yes, sir.

18:51.366 --> 18:54.500
What's a Light Aircraft Doing in the Water

18:57.533 --> 18:59.166
A male in his 30s...

19:00.333 --> 19:01.600
He's 178cm...

19:01.666 --> 19:03.000
RH positive O?

19:13.000 --> 19:13.900
Come and see me.

19:21.833 --> 19:24.900
Do you have the medical records
of Agent Hyun-jun Kim?

19:26.033 --> 19:29.433
It's forbidden to even talk
about Hyun-jun inside the NSS.

19:29.766 --> 19:31.300
What could possibly be left of him?

19:32.033 --> 19:33.066
I really need them.

19:37.500 --> 19:38.400
Wait a second.

19:46.466 --> 19:48.066
STOCK TRADING

19:49.033 --> 19:49.933
Oh...

19:55.466 --> 19:56.433
-What are you doing?
-Gosh!

19:56.600 --> 19:57.533
Come on!

19:57.866 --> 19:59.166
You should knock before you come in.

19:59.900 --> 20:02.533
I did knock, but you didn't notice.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.466
REAL TIME STOCK CHART

20:07.533 --> 20:08.433
Gosh...

20:08.500 --> 20:12.433
Because of the information that you gave
me last time, I'm about to go bankrupt.

20:12.900 --> 20:14.566
You told me it'd double
or even three times,

20:14.633 --> 20:17.266
but I only have half of a half.
You have to take responsibility for it.

20:17.866 --> 20:18.766
Hey.

20:19.433 --> 20:22.066
The investment should be
made at your own discretion.

20:22.200 --> 20:23.966
Who are you blaming now?

20:24.500 --> 20:27.533
Then, were you going to share it with me
if you had earned a profit?

20:28.366 --> 20:31.900
Okay, just forget it.
You always pick up such weird information.

20:34.400 --> 20:35.633
By the way, what brought you here?

20:38.000 --> 20:39.233
By any chance,

20:39.766 --> 20:41.833
do you have the medical records
of Hyun-jun Kim?

20:41.900 --> 20:43.766
Of course not, I discarded everything.

20:43.833 --> 20:47.066
Come on, why are you doing this to me?
I already know that you have them.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.300
If you carelessly talk about this,

20:53.966 --> 20:55.866
we'll be in big trouble.

20:56.133 --> 20:57.000
Understand?

20:57.600 --> 20:59.400
I get it, so please just give it to me.

21:25.533 --> 21:26.466
Seung-hee.

21:34.100 --> 21:35.000
Now,

21:35.666 --> 21:36.800
you won't even see me?

21:40.866 --> 21:42.266
The Hungarian Intelligence Agency sent

21:43.166 --> 21:45.533
the information of the body found
in the crashed light airplane.

21:47.266 --> 21:48.866
It matches

21:49.800 --> 21:51.266
with Hyun-jun's medical records

21:53.400 --> 21:54.400
that the NSS has kept.

21:56.633 --> 21:58.133
Check it for yourself.

22:07.900 --> 22:09.733
I'm deliberately
delivering this cruel news to you,

22:10.733 --> 22:12.666
who still believes Hyun-jun is alive.

22:13.866 --> 22:15.866
It's because I want you

22:16.600 --> 22:18.433
to completely scrape off
your painful memories

22:20.100 --> 22:21.466
from your heart and bring an end

22:22.666 --> 22:24.266
to the feelings
that you have for Hyun-jun.

22:25.233 --> 22:26.100
That's the only way

22:27.600 --> 22:29.000
that you can keep on living.

24:00.733 --> 24:02.633
The person who saved me
in Hungary said to me,

24:04.133 --> 24:05.900
"In politics, nothing happens by accident.

24:07.766 --> 24:09.066
If it happens,

24:10.666 --> 24:12.000
you can bet it was planned that way."

24:15.066 --> 24:16.266
He told me

24:18.133 --> 24:19.800
what'd happened to me
was intended by someone

24:21.866 --> 24:23.266
and it would continue to happen.

24:26.866 --> 24:27.900
As he said,

24:29.233 --> 24:30.600
if it was really intended by someone,

24:32.433 --> 24:34.800
I'm not sure why I had to be his target.

24:40.100 --> 24:41.266
Tell me

24:43.900 --> 24:45.400
what has happened.

24:48.766 --> 24:49.633
It all started

24:52.366 --> 24:53.800
with the defection of Seung-ryong Hong.

24:57.133 --> 24:58.033
Our team helped

24:58.266 --> 25:00.500
Seung-ryong Hong escape,
who requested for political asylum,

25:01.166 --> 25:03.800
and handed him over to the support team,
which would head to South Korea.

25:05.366 --> 25:06.333
However, before long,

25:07.633 --> 25:09.266
we heard that Seung-ryong Hong was killed.

25:11.066 --> 25:11.900
I took

25:12.066 --> 25:14.466
-on another solo mission.
-You have...

25:15.066 --> 25:16.233
a solo mission.

25:18.633 --> 25:19.733
My mission was

25:20.900 --> 25:22.733
to assassinate President Seong-cheol Yun.

25:25.400 --> 25:26.733
Although I succeeded in my mission,

25:28.300 --> 25:29.933
I was wounded during the escape.

25:32.200 --> 25:33.633
So I requested for the rescue team.

25:36.266 --> 25:37.966
The person who came
to rescue me was my friend,

25:39.166 --> 25:41.433
who had been through a lot with me,

25:41.900 --> 25:43.033
even before joining the NSS.

25:44.300 --> 25:45.266
However,

25:46.233 --> 25:48.733
the friend, who I thought had come
to rescue me, pointed a gun at me,

25:50.100 --> 25:52.066
saying it was an order.

25:52.166 --> 25:53.133
Sa-woo.

25:54.700 --> 25:55.666
I'm sorry.

25:58.300 --> 25:59.366
It's an order.

25:59.600 --> 26:00.700
Since then,

26:02.533 --> 26:03.900
without even knowing the reason,

26:04.966 --> 26:07.333
I was chased by both the North and South.

26:10.300 --> 26:11.266
While being chased,

26:11.933 --> 26:13.633
I called the person who abandoned me.

26:16.766 --> 26:18.566
I told him that I'd come back
alive without fail.

26:19.933 --> 26:21.166
And if I did,

26:22.533 --> 26:24.066
I would never forgive him.

26:29.533 --> 26:30.600
But his answer was

26:32.566 --> 26:33.566
that she was there.

26:34.600 --> 26:35.933
The woman that I loved,

26:38.833 --> 26:41.433
that I value more than my own life,
was in Budapest.

26:46.133 --> 26:47.333
I received the threats

26:49.300 --> 26:51.366
that her fate would end up
the same as mine.

26:53.533 --> 26:54.666
I met Seung-hee,

26:56.766 --> 26:58.466
and we tried to escape
from Hungary together.

27:01.500 --> 27:03.833
I'll check the train times.
Don't move an inch and stay here.

27:05.200 --> 27:06.333
However, during our escape,

27:15.700 --> 27:16.766
Seung-hee died.

27:24.866 --> 27:26.066
What I want to know is

27:27.000 --> 27:28.633
not why you're here.

27:29.066 --> 27:31.033
The man in Budapest at that time...

27:33.133 --> 27:35.366
I want to know whether he's alive or not.

27:41.000 --> 27:43.933
I tried to escape
from Hungary in a light airplane,

27:47.333 --> 27:49.233
but the plane was shot down
by my friend and crashed.

27:54.933 --> 27:56.766
I thought my life would end like that,

27:58.166 --> 27:59.266
but when I opened my eyes,

27:59.700 --> 28:00.666
I was at a hospital.

28:03.900 --> 28:05.500
The person who told me

28:05.866 --> 28:08.166
that everything that happened to me
was intended by someone...

28:09.200 --> 28:11.100
I realized that he had saved me.

28:12.766 --> 28:13.733
I couldn't

28:14.933 --> 28:16.966
even trust the person
who had saved my life.

28:20.233 --> 28:22.566
I escaped from that place
and came to Japan.

28:23.266 --> 28:24.700
Then, I prepared my revenge

28:25.000 --> 28:26.266
on the people who had abandoned me.

28:28.866 --> 28:30.266
When I was about to return to Korea,

28:31.033 --> 28:32.300
I received a call from Yuki.

28:32.366 --> 28:33.566
Mister...

28:33.666 --> 28:35.466
-I learned that
-The USB drive that you received

28:35.533 --> 28:37.866
-the one who's trying to kill me is after
-from Seung-ryong Hong.

28:37.933 --> 28:39.666
the necklace I got from
Seung-ryong Hong before.

28:42.133 --> 28:43.000
This is

28:45.300 --> 28:47.366
the necklace that I got
in exchange for Yuki's death.

28:48.933 --> 28:50.033
While listening to your story,

28:51.400 --> 28:52.800
a few questions came to my mind.

28:54.866 --> 28:56.166
Who killed Seung-ryong Hong,

28:56.300 --> 28:59.066
who successfully defected
and was handed over to the support team?

29:01.400 --> 29:02.466
As far as I know,

29:03.466 --> 29:04.733
Seung-ryong Hong's death has

29:06.666 --> 29:08.366
nothing to do with the North.

29:11.466 --> 29:12.366
Secondly,

29:12.966 --> 29:14.800
it's about the death
of President Seong-cheol Yun.

29:16.566 --> 29:18.700
It was a diplomatic problem
that could have led to war,

29:20.333 --> 29:21.700
but it was quieted down too easily.

29:22.900 --> 29:24.966
The President of the Supreme
People's Assembly was killed

29:25.066 --> 29:26.200
by a South Korean agent.

29:27.766 --> 29:28.833
The North...

29:29.533 --> 29:30.633
And the South...

29:32.633 --> 29:34.866
They both covered up the case in a hurry.
Why would they?

29:37.266 --> 29:38.233
Lastly,

29:40.233 --> 29:42.500
the person who was killed
at the train station in Budapest...

29:45.200 --> 29:46.366
That person...

29:48.500 --> 29:49.733
The car explosion at that time was

29:51.333 --> 29:52.600
not designed by the North, either.

29:55.766 --> 29:56.933
If my guess is right,

29:57.466 --> 29:59.266
the person who killed
Seung-ryong Hong is the same

30:00.333 --> 30:03.200
as the one who killed Yuki
to get this necklace.

30:05.466 --> 30:07.833
Also, it was not
the South Korean government

30:08.500 --> 30:10.333
that ordered you to kill
President Seong-cheol Yun,

30:12.833 --> 30:14.700
but it was an individual order
from that person,

30:16.033 --> 30:18.133
or the conspiracy
of an unknown organization.

30:20.533 --> 30:21.533
As it stands,

30:24.200 --> 30:25.333
this necklace is

30:27.133 --> 30:28.500
the only link, connecting everything.

30:32.100 --> 30:34.433
Who is behind the murder
of Seung-ryong Hong and Seong-cheol Yun?

30:38.500 --> 30:40.000
Why were you selected,

30:41.700 --> 30:42.800
and why were you abandoned?

30:46.066 --> 30:47.800
I believe the clue to these questions

30:50.866 --> 30:52.033
will be in here.

33:00.733 --> 33:02.133
Why are you staying by my side?

33:03.533 --> 33:04.866
There were many chances to kill me.

33:06.466 --> 33:08.000
You could've killed me and gone back.

33:16.500 --> 33:17.433
It's too late...

33:19.000 --> 33:20.100
for me to go back.

33:23.400 --> 33:24.266
Too late?

33:35.833 --> 33:37.000
When I was 18,

33:38.600 --> 33:40.700
I was selected as a candidate
for the Supreme Guard.

33:42.833 --> 33:44.666
Until I became an elite agent,

33:47.400 --> 33:48.866
you could imagine

33:50.566 --> 33:51.866
what kind of training I received

33:54.766 --> 33:56.833
and what life I had to go through
throughout seven years,

33:56.900 --> 33:58.533
since you'd also
received special trainings.

34:01.866 --> 34:04.400
I endured all the hellish training,

34:09.666 --> 34:11.266
but what I really couldn't stand was

34:15.199 --> 34:16.233
to kill

34:17.400 --> 34:18.666
people.

34:22.766 --> 34:25.800
The prisoners on death row
were sent to the training camp,

34:28.666 --> 34:30.033
and as if we'd played hare coursing,

34:31.333 --> 34:32.800
I killed them one by one.

34:35.966 --> 34:36.966
And later,

34:40.566 --> 34:42.233
I even killed the comrades,
who had gone AWOL

34:45.466 --> 34:46.433
from the training.

34:49.066 --> 34:50.300
It was hard only in the beginning.

34:52.400 --> 34:53.600
Even killing people became

34:56.633 --> 34:57.866
easier and easier.

35:02.933 --> 35:05.300
Killing people one after another,

35:08.200 --> 35:09.200
I felt

35:10.900 --> 35:12.033
my blood

35:15.366 --> 35:17.033
and my heart were getting cold.

35:20.666 --> 35:21.600
In the end,

35:24.133 --> 35:26.633
when I could kill people with no emotions,

35:29.366 --> 35:31.400
I became an official agent
of the Supreme Guard.

35:40.166 --> 35:41.633
Throughout those difficult years,

35:45.233 --> 35:47.266
what kept me going was only

35:51.966 --> 35:52.833
my mother

35:56.566 --> 35:57.933
and my younger siblings.

36:02.100 --> 36:03.133
But because of me,

36:05.233 --> 36:06.233
they're all dead.

36:11.566 --> 36:12.700
Therefore,

36:14.800 --> 36:15.733
I have no reason

36:19.366 --> 36:20.833
to go back.

37:13.033 --> 37:14.133
The password has been solved.

37:20.900 --> 37:21.900
Iris...

38:51.633 --> 38:52.900
It seems like they already escaped.

38:54.533 --> 38:56.866
It looks impossible to recover the data.

38:58.166 --> 38:59.400
Damn it!

39:08.533 --> 39:09.366
Hello.

39:10.066 --> 39:11.466
We just raided their hideout,

39:12.100 --> 39:14.633
but they had already escaped
after burning all the data.

39:15.566 --> 39:18.433
Bring back everything
even if it looks insignificant.

39:18.500 --> 39:19.400
Yes, I got it.

40:03.400 --> 40:04.433
We found him!

40:14.933 --> 40:15.766
Run!

40:54.333 --> 40:55.200
This way!

41:43.066 --> 41:44.400
Let me tell you my conclusion first.

41:45.733 --> 41:47.000
The body found this time has

41:47.966 --> 41:51.466
nothing to do with the Vladivostok case
that Secretary Hwang is in charge of.

41:53.266 --> 41:54.166
What?

41:54.533 --> 41:55.533
Based on what?

41:56.466 --> 41:57.333
Well...

41:57.400 --> 41:58.266
It's my hunch.

41:59.966 --> 42:00.800
Come on.

42:00.866 --> 42:02.166
If you tell me like this,

42:02.366 --> 42:04.100
how can I submit my report?

42:04.933 --> 42:06.400
You should take care of it on your own.

42:06.766 --> 42:09.033
Seriously, this is too much.

42:09.866 --> 42:10.766
Hey, you!

42:11.000 --> 42:11.900
You know...

42:12.366 --> 42:14.833
I've been working here
since your nose was dripping like faucet.

42:15.833 --> 42:18.566
You punk, just accept my words
when I tell you so, huh?

42:18.966 --> 42:19.933
I understand.

42:30.366 --> 42:31.366
The KCSI is supposed

42:31.500 --> 42:35.100
to provide scientific grounds, but then...
What's this hunch crap?

42:35.733 --> 42:37.633
Well... That's...

42:38.333 --> 42:39.433
because it's correct.

42:40.200 --> 42:41.533
What about the results for our side?

42:41.966 --> 42:42.900
It's not available yet?

42:43.500 --> 42:46.633
Well, that's...
I think that will take some time.

42:47.400 --> 42:48.266
Why?

42:48.766 --> 42:50.333
You don't have a hunch yet?

42:54.633 --> 42:55.533
You punk...

42:55.966 --> 42:57.166
If there's anything else to talk,

42:57.233 --> 42:58.233
let's wrap up the meeting.

43:01.866 --> 43:02.733
You know...

43:04.900 --> 43:07.033
Today is Seung-hee Choi's birthday.

43:09.033 --> 43:09.933
So?

43:11.566 --> 43:13.833
I'd like to throw
a surprise party for her.

43:14.100 --> 43:14.933
Wow!

43:15.000 --> 43:16.266
That's a great idea.

43:17.466 --> 43:18.466
Seung-hee must be

43:18.800 --> 43:19.833
in such a bad mood,

43:20.200 --> 43:21.866
so let's call her out
and get her some drinks.

43:22.200 --> 43:24.633
Would she come out even if we called her?
She won't.

43:25.766 --> 43:29.166
I heard she doesn't even go to
the florist and stays at home these days.

43:29.866 --> 43:30.700
She won't come out.

43:31.500 --> 43:32.433
If she doesn't come out,

43:33.366 --> 43:34.333
we can go to her.

43:34.866 --> 43:35.700
Right.

43:36.333 --> 43:37.266
Oh...

43:39.066 --> 43:41.166
Yeah, Mi-jeong is on the ball.

43:41.566 --> 43:43.300
-Let's go!
-You'll join us, right?

43:45.933 --> 43:46.866
Ah, yes.

43:48.000 --> 43:49.500
Yes, I think I should go.

44:09.133 --> 44:10.066
She's not home, maybe?

44:12.466 --> 44:13.300
She's home.

44:14.033 --> 44:15.466
I did GPS tracking on her.

44:16.566 --> 44:17.466
Way too good.

44:18.833 --> 44:19.800
Let's go in.

44:20.433 --> 44:21.266
Oh, just a second!

44:23.166 --> 44:24.366
Let's wear these before we go in.

44:25.066 --> 44:26.100
Oh, my!

44:26.166 --> 44:27.866
-Ta-da!
- This looks nice.

44:27.933 --> 44:28.933
Please put these on. Hurry.

44:29.566 --> 44:30.766
Here's yours.

44:31.266 --> 44:32.533
-Please put this on.
-Come on...

44:32.600 --> 44:34.766
Should we seriously go this far?

44:35.166 --> 44:37.166
Hurry up and just put it on.
It's all for fun.

44:37.933 --> 44:39.266
-Peekaboo.
-Everybody looks good!

44:42.100 --> 44:43.033
Really?

44:44.966 --> 44:46.000
Okay, let's go in.

44:46.833 --> 44:47.666
Let's go.

44:59.066 --> 44:59.966
I think she's sleeping.

45:11.633 --> 45:12.566
Seung-hee.

45:15.366 --> 45:16.300
Seung-hee.

45:18.100 --> 45:19.200
Are you sleeping already?

45:23.000 --> 45:23.900
Seung-hee.

45:24.600 --> 45:26.433
Seung-hee, wake up! Seung-hee!

45:27.166 --> 45:28.233
Wake up!

45:28.300 --> 45:29.200
What's the matter?

45:29.966 --> 45:31.666
-Seung-hee!
-What is it?

45:31.733 --> 45:32.600
What's wrong with her?

45:33.600 --> 45:34.500
Seung-hee.

45:34.566 --> 45:35.500
Seung-hee, wake up!

45:35.866 --> 45:36.733
Seung-hee.

45:37.733 --> 45:38.566
Seung-hee!

45:39.166 --> 45:41.066
Seung-hee, wake up! Seung-hee!

45:41.133 --> 45:43.366
Seung-hee! Call an ambulance right now!

45:43.900 --> 45:45.800
Seung-hee! Seung-hee, wake up!

45:45.966 --> 45:47.033
Seung-hee!

45:48.166 --> 45:50.700
YUSEOKSEON HOSPITAL

45:51.733 --> 45:54.233
Because of dehydration,
she seems to have a high fever.

45:54.300 --> 45:56.866
For a couple of weeks, she will get an IV.

45:57.333 --> 45:58.633
Let's wait and see how she's doing.

45:59.366 --> 46:00.266
Yes.

46:16.566 --> 46:17.600
You...

46:22.433 --> 46:23.966
You're having such a hard time,

46:26.300 --> 46:27.233
but I...

46:33.666 --> 46:35.700
I'm sorry that I can't do anything.

46:48.566 --> 46:50.433
What would it be like if it were Hyun-jun?

46:51.766 --> 46:52.733
If...

46:55.600 --> 46:56.533
If he were in my shoes,

47:00.900 --> 47:01.900
what would he do?

47:39.566 --> 47:40.433
It's me.

47:40.500 --> 47:41.933
I've been waiting for you.

47:43.666 --> 47:45.100
I have something that I want to ask you.

47:46.466 --> 47:47.733
What is Iris?

47:50.133 --> 47:51.800
You must have decoded the file

47:52.066 --> 47:53.566
that you received from Seung-ryong Hong.

47:54.766 --> 47:55.866
Couldn't you show me

47:56.500 --> 47:57.900
the contents inside it?

48:00.800 --> 48:03.633
I saved your life

48:04.100 --> 48:06.200
and gave you a clue to decoding the file.

48:07.566 --> 48:08.666
That will be enough

48:09.600 --> 48:11.533
to give me a right to see the contents.

48:12.566 --> 48:13.766
I'll ask you one more time.

48:14.800 --> 48:16.100
What is Iris?

48:16.800 --> 48:18.000
Iris is

48:18.966 --> 48:23.033
a secret organization
that has existed even longer

48:23.700 --> 48:24.900
than you can imagine.

48:26.333 --> 48:27.600
That organization derives

48:27.800 --> 48:30.666
a lot of profit through disputes
between nations and military expansion.

48:32.800 --> 48:34.800
Are you talking
about a military-industrial complex?

48:35.500 --> 48:36.466
It's

48:37.000 --> 48:38.333
a lot bigger than that.

48:39.666 --> 48:42.900
Iris manipulates assassinations
and terrorist attacks

48:43.400 --> 48:45.300
and triggers disputes among countries.

48:45.700 --> 48:46.900
They also possess the power

48:47.133 --> 48:50.733
to overturn a government
if it's acting against their interests.

48:52.466 --> 48:57.100
To them, a nation is nothing but an object
that can be beneficial to them or not.

48:58.600 --> 49:01.100
In the North Korean government,
not to mention in South Korea,

49:01.900 --> 49:04.866
and in the military, I'm sure Iris exists.

49:07.000 --> 49:10.433
What you've found out
from decoding the file is

49:11.100 --> 49:12.333
just the tip of the iceberg.

49:13.466 --> 49:14.666
Nobody has figured out

49:15.700 --> 49:17.633
the real identity of Iris so far.

49:20.533 --> 49:23.166
They chose you,

49:24.266 --> 49:25.566
they used you

49:26.433 --> 49:27.366
and

49:28.133 --> 49:29.100
they abandoned you.

49:31.066 --> 49:32.633
Hand that file over to me.

49:33.600 --> 49:36.400
I will help you take revenge.

50:12.800 --> 50:15.733
Last time,
when the guests came from the North,

50:17.000 --> 50:18.233
you must have wondered

50:19.533 --> 50:22.400
why the NSS was excluded
throughout all the process.

50:23.500 --> 50:25.133
It was the first time

50:25.500 --> 50:28.233
that the NSS was totally excluded
from the matter of South and North Korea.

50:29.000 --> 50:30.600
To be honest, I was rather flustered.

50:33.000 --> 50:35.500
What do you think the reason is?

50:36.800 --> 50:37.766
Well...

50:38.800 --> 50:39.800
I don't know.

50:42.533 --> 50:44.366
The kidnapping of Seung-ryong Hong

50:45.133 --> 50:46.700
and the assassination of Seong-cheol Yun,

50:48.066 --> 50:49.800
the cases where the NSS was involved.

50:51.200 --> 50:52.200
As you know,

50:53.033 --> 50:54.866
the outcomes of the both incidents
were not good.

51:01.966 --> 51:02.933
The President...

51:04.200 --> 51:06.266
doesn't seem to trust you.

51:12.000 --> 51:12.966
The President offered

51:13.533 --> 51:17.633
to hold a summit to the North,
and their response is positive as well.

51:18.900 --> 51:21.800
If you don't want the NSS
to be left out from the summit,

51:23.066 --> 51:27.200
you'll need a breakthrough
that can earn the president's trust.

51:28.233 --> 51:30.500
I'm not sure

51:32.033 --> 51:33.666
how I'd be able to win his trust.

51:35.300 --> 51:36.566
Look, Director Baek.

51:37.966 --> 51:40.400
I know what a political person you are.

51:41.233 --> 51:43.800
You don't have to pretend
to be naive to me.

51:46.266 --> 51:47.333
You know better

51:48.033 --> 51:49.900
than anybody else

51:50.166 --> 51:52.233
to regain the President's trust.

51:52.900 --> 51:53.800
Right?

53:40.166 --> 53:42.300
Have you heard about Ms. Choi?

53:42.900 --> 53:43.766
Yeah.

53:45.833 --> 53:47.100
Once she lost a strand of hope

53:47.466 --> 53:49.166
that she was clinging onto,

53:50.200 --> 53:51.766
she seems to have lost a will to live.

53:53.833 --> 53:54.800
If she keeps going on,

53:55.033 --> 53:56.566
I'm afraid something terrible may happen.

53:57.700 --> 53:59.400
In order for a person to change,

54:00.066 --> 54:01.200
they should hit bottom.

54:02.766 --> 54:03.633
Do you know

54:03.700 --> 54:05.433
what it means to hit bottom?

54:07.333 --> 54:08.633
She'll overcome her sorrow

54:08.966 --> 54:12.400
when it's scraped off
from the bottom of her heart.

54:14.933 --> 54:16.100
If she's going to hit bottom,

54:16.400 --> 54:19.166
this much pain should be
naturally accompanied, so don't worry.

54:25.866 --> 54:26.866
You...

54:28.733 --> 54:30.066
Do you like Seung-hee Choi?

54:33.466 --> 54:34.333
No, sir.

54:36.833 --> 54:38.533
Then, I'll excuse myself.

54:56.900 --> 54:58.333
We received a call from Sun-hwa Kim.

55:01.166 --> 55:02.300
She said she wants to see you.

55:04.266 --> 55:05.133
But

55:05.200 --> 55:07.100
she wants you to come alone.

55:08.733 --> 55:10.833
It doesn't feel right.
Let me accompany you.

55:10.900 --> 55:11.933
No, that's fine.

55:12.666 --> 55:13.566
I'm going alone.

55:14.866 --> 55:15.700
Where is she?

55:17.666 --> 55:18.866
She's in Shanghai, China.

55:42.366 --> 55:43.500
I arrived in Shanghai.

55:44.566 --> 55:45.566
Where should I go?

55:49.333 --> 55:50.200
Okay.

56:01.566 --> 56:03.533
This is a satellite picture
of Yongbyon, North Korea.

56:03.600 --> 56:05.800
After analyzing any changes
in the nuclear facilities,

56:05.866 --> 56:06.766
write a report.

56:07.666 --> 56:08.800
Until when should I finish it?

56:09.633 --> 56:10.900
It's urgent, so finish it quickly.

56:11.600 --> 56:13.266
Gosh, I have a heap of work to do.

56:15.133 --> 56:16.833
Don't whine.

56:16.966 --> 56:18.266
I'm not whining.

56:18.833 --> 56:20.333
I have to analyze communication tapping,

56:20.400 --> 56:22.866
check the communication security
for the Counter-terrorism Division,

56:22.933 --> 56:23.766
and

56:23.833 --> 56:26.200
the National Intelligence Service
asked me for a background check.

56:28.300 --> 56:29.233
What is this?

56:29.733 --> 56:32.000
The Japanese Intelligence Office
interrogated one Asian man,

56:33.033 --> 56:35.533
and they assume he's a Korean
and requested for the background check.

56:38.533 --> 56:40.266
I'll do it for you, so you write a report.

56:42.033 --> 56:43.066
Then, I'd be grateful.

56:43.933 --> 56:44.833
Seriously...

56:45.333 --> 56:46.600
I'll finish it as soon as possible.

57:58.233 --> 57:59.166
Yes, come in.

58:08.266 --> 58:09.266
You came at the right time.

58:10.066 --> 58:11.066
Seung-hee Choi

58:11.366 --> 58:12.866
will return to her position from today.

58:18.000 --> 58:19.066
What's the matter?

58:19.600 --> 58:20.500
Well...

58:21.700 --> 58:22.833
I'll report it later.

59:04.033 --> 59:05.166
It's been a long time, Sun-hwa.

59:07.233 --> 59:08.166
Yes.

59:09.233 --> 59:10.266
When did you come here?

59:11.800 --> 59:12.700
It's been a little while.

59:16.766 --> 59:17.766
I'm really sorry

59:18.866 --> 59:20.066
about what happened

59:22.033 --> 59:23.333
to your mother and Sun-mi.

59:24.700 --> 59:26.633
I know you couldn't do
anything about it, Lieutenant.

59:28.800 --> 59:29.833
It's all my fault.

59:37.433 --> 59:38.766
Why did you want to see me?

59:45.666 --> 59:47.200
There's a place you need to go with me.

59:48.333 --> 59:49.500
I'll tell you when we get there.

1:00:15.066 --> 1:00:18.766
NANJING STREET

1:00:43.366 --> 1:00:44.300
ANTIQUE STORE

1:01:08.500 --> 1:01:09.400
Please sit down.

1:02:10.866 --> 1:02:12.566
Why did you come
to look for Chul-young Park?

1:02:12.766 --> 1:02:16.066
San Baek and I needed help for my revenge.

1:02:20.966 --> 1:02:22.466
Betrayal becomes a habit.

1:02:22.733 --> 1:02:23.900
Stop talking nonsense.

1:02:26.700 --> 1:02:28.033
Don't try to take my side any more.

1:02:29.133 --> 1:02:30.500
The President's trump card is

1:02:30.700 --> 1:02:31.766
the nuclear program.

1:02:33.766 --> 1:02:34.633
He's Hyun-jun, right?

1:02:37.133 --> 1:02:38.333
I have something to tell you.

1:02:38.400 --> 1:02:39.333
What is it?

1:02:41.633 --> 1:02:43.066
Dispatch the SWAT right away.

1:02:45.033 --> 1:02:46.100
-Ma'am.
-Yes.

1:02:46.266 --> 1:02:47.966
I think I got something.

1:02:51.500 --> 1:02:52.733
They're still inside the house.

1:03:25.133 --> 1:03:26.366
You can't go now.

1:03:30.200 --> 1:03:32.266
What did you do to Seung-hee?

1:03:33.600 --> 1:03:37.233
Think about why we've come this far.

1:03:40.933 --> 1:03:42.766
No one will believe you.

1:03:47.966 --> 1:03:49.966
In politics, nothing happens by accident.

1:03:51.433 --> 1:03:56.000
If something happens, you can bet
it was planned that way.
