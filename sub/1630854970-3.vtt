WEBVTT

00:51.635 --> 00:54.555
- Morning.
- Morning. Made you some coffee.

00:55.264 --> 00:56.723
I don't do caffeine.

00:57.474 --> 00:59.935
Right. Your body is a temple.

01:00.519 --> 01:04.105
Well, I don't know about that.
More like a church in an airport.

01:07.943 --> 01:09.069
Big day for Richmond.

01:09.653 --> 01:11.238
Thought you didn't know
anything about football.

01:12.030 --> 01:14.533
I don't. But I know who Zava is.

01:15.117 --> 01:16.618
Of course.

01:17.411 --> 01:18.871
Text me when you get back from Dubai?

01:25.544 --> 01:28.589
- Safe flight.
- Thanks. Safe driving.

01:50.694 --> 01:52.321
I am a strong and capable man.

02:00.829 --> 02:01.830
Bollocks.

02:38.158 --> 02:41.912
Okay. So obviously Zava's gonna be
moving into our starting lineup.

02:41.912 --> 02:44.248
Which means, if my maths...

02:45.541 --> 02:46.667
are corrects,

02:46.667 --> 02:47.918
we're gonna have to sit someone.

02:48.502 --> 02:49.419
Who's it gonna be?

02:49.419 --> 02:50.879
Well, I think it's gotta be Colin.

02:50.879 --> 02:51.964
Ouch.

02:52.422 --> 02:55.092
Colin's a chameleon.
He can change depending on a situation.

02:55.092 --> 02:58.095
Bigger issue is, you put Zava up front,

02:58.095 --> 03:00.430
either Jamie or Dani's gonna have
to drop back to midfield.

03:00.430 --> 03:03.225
So, who do we think will take
the news better? Dani or Jamie?

03:03.225 --> 03:04.726
Dani.

03:04.726 --> 03:09.189
Yeah. Nah, Jamie's a lot like my mom's
Precious Moments figurines collection.

03:09.773 --> 03:12.234
- I have no idea what that means.
- He's a fragile little bitch.

03:13.485 --> 03:16.738
Brevity is nice, but sometimes clarity
is the true soul of wit. Thank you, Roy.

03:18.949 --> 03:20.784
It's almost ten o'clock,
we should probably get going.

03:20.784 --> 03:22.035
You feeling okay?

03:22.035 --> 03:25.873
A little bit nervous.
Had some diarrhea earlier this morning.

03:25.873 --> 03:27.291
Please don't put that in the book.

03:28.125 --> 03:30.169
I've never been clear
on the spelling, so I probably won't.

03:30.169 --> 03:31.920
D-I-A, double R, H-E-A.

03:31.920 --> 03:36.758
Except in England, you have a silent O,
as in, "Oh, no, you've got diarrhea."

03:37.342 --> 03:38.886
I'm in the same boat, Higgy bear.

03:38.886 --> 03:42.181
My tummy's got more knots in it than
<i>Wayne's World</i> 1 and 2 smooshed together.

03:42.764 --> 03:44.933
I don't know why. I've been around
great athletes all my life.

03:44.933 --> 03:46.435
Heck, Roy, you're a great athlete.

03:46.435 --> 03:47.769
Not like Zava.

03:47.769 --> 03:49.479
Come on, don't sell yourself short.

03:49.479 --> 03:51.690
If anything, sell yourself tall
and get it altered later.

03:51.690 --> 03:53.942
No, Zava's different. Just watch.

03:53.942 --> 03:56.111
We can't just watch.
We gotta make this fella part of the team.

03:57.112 --> 04:00.532
Coaching a superstar can't be all,
"How do you solve a problem like Maria?"

04:01.450 --> 04:03.827
Although, if you ask me, the Nazis
were the real problem in that story.

04:03.827 --> 04:05.621
- Am I right, Coach?
- Yeah. Come on, Mother Superior,

04:05.621 --> 04:07.706
- let's have a little perspective.
- Yeah, exactly, yeah.

04:07.706 --> 04:09.875
Sorry, Roy, I know you don't like
all this musical theater talk

04:09.875 --> 04:11.585
- this early in the morning.
- No, I'll allow it.

04:11.585 --> 04:14.713
I used to fancy Julie Andrews.
Well, I still do, to be fair.

04:14.713 --> 04:18.800
The voice, the eyes, the way you know
she'd tell you off if you'd been bad.

04:18.800 --> 04:19.885
Yeah.

04:21.887 --> 04:24.515
All right, we gotta do it. All-time
favorite Julie Andrews character. Go!

04:24.515 --> 04:25.724
Fuck it. Maria!

04:25.724 --> 04:28.435
- Resolute as always. Coach, what you got?
- Eliza Doolittle.

04:29.144 --> 04:31.146
Audio-only performance, I love that.

04:31.647 --> 04:33.273
- Professor Higgins.
- Come on you Poppins!

04:33.273 --> 04:35.150
Same, I'm right there with you.

04:35.150 --> 04:36.944
Trent, you have one?
You don't have to. You got one?

04:36.944 --> 04:39.279
Clarisse Renaldi, Queen of Genovia.

04:41.490 --> 04:43.158
Fuck yeah, <i>Princess Diaries</i>.

04:43.158 --> 04:45.285
Deep cut. Zagged.

04:45.285 --> 04:49.623
Wow. Wow. This is nice.

04:49.623 --> 04:51.375
I can't believe it's really happening.

04:51.875 --> 04:54.169
When I was a boy, I played in Zava boots,

04:54.169 --> 04:56.004
I slept in Zava boots,

04:56.004 --> 04:58.465
I made love for the first time
to Zava boots.

04:59.049 --> 05:01.009
Think you mean "in Zava boots."

05:01.510 --> 05:02.511
No.

05:03.011 --> 05:04.888
Hey, you know,
last night at the restaurant,

05:04.888 --> 05:06.265
as the painters were finishing up,

05:06.265 --> 05:09.768
I spent a very pleasurable hour on YouTube
watching Zava's greatest goals.

05:09.768 --> 05:11.186
By the end, my head was spinning.

05:12.688 --> 05:14.439
Though it may also have been
the paint fumes.

05:14.439 --> 05:18.485
The way Zava moves on the pitch...
Like a panther.

05:19.278 --> 05:20.153
So sexy, eh?

05:21.071 --> 05:22.281
Sound a bit gay, bruv.

05:22.281 --> 05:23.365
Well, I'm gay...

05:23.365 --> 05:24.449
Huh?

05:24.449 --> 05:25.617
...for Zava, I mean.

05:26.493 --> 05:29.580
That's true. Some men have a charisma
that transcends orientation.

05:30.122 --> 05:33.125
Paul Newman, Idris Elba, Norm Macdonald.

05:33.959 --> 05:37.129
Zava is definitely one
of those charisma unicorns.

05:37.754 --> 05:40.007
Okay, you guys have convinced me.
I'll have sex with Zava.

05:44.761 --> 05:46.013
Hey, what's up, man?

05:46.972 --> 05:48.265
What the fuck is this?

05:50.184 --> 05:52.936
All right, fellas, come on. Showtime.
Let's everybody head out to the pitch.

05:52.936 --> 05:54.521
- Let's go.
- Hey Jamie, come on, man.

05:54.521 --> 05:57.149
Hurry up and get dressed. We don't wanna
keep our newest teammate waiting.

05:58.317 --> 05:59.401
Let's do this.

06:03.447 --> 06:05.657
We want Zava! Come on!

06:12.206 --> 06:13.540
This is what you get.

06:20.881 --> 06:22.174
Where the hell is he?

06:23.342 --> 06:25.636
Leslie!
We do have a signed contract, don't we?

06:25.636 --> 06:29.515
Of course. We have an e-signature.
That's legally binding.

06:30.724 --> 06:31.808
I think.

06:33.936 --> 06:34.978
I'll make a call.

06:35.687 --> 06:37.523
His agent hasn't heard from him,

06:37.523 --> 06:40.817
but she's tracked his phone
which is currently in Mykonos.

06:40.817 --> 06:42.402
If he has changed his mind again,

06:42.402 --> 06:44.530
I'm going to look
like an absolute arsehole.

06:45.447 --> 06:48.158
Maybe we can try and cheer them up
somehow?

06:49.326 --> 06:51.578
Do you want me to take my shirt off
and run across the pitch?

06:52.579 --> 06:53.580
You must be Shandy.

06:54.498 --> 06:57.209
Shandy's shadowing me for the day.
To get the hang of things, you know?

06:57.209 --> 06:59.336
It's so nice to finally meet you.

06:59.336 --> 07:01.588
I'd love to go for a coffee
and pick your brain sometime.

07:02.339 --> 07:03.465
Like, how tall are you?

07:04.675 --> 07:05.717
- Shandy.
- Yeah?

07:05.717 --> 07:09.012
Would you go to concessions
and start selling merch at half price?

07:09.596 --> 07:11.515
- Great idea.
- Yeah, thank you.

07:12.182 --> 07:14.142
- Keep your shirt on.
- Right. Of course.

07:14.142 --> 07:15.352
Bye, babe.

07:17.020 --> 07:18.647
She's a live one.

07:20.232 --> 07:21.567
Shit. Now I'm late.

07:21.567 --> 07:22.568
For what?

07:23.277 --> 07:27.364
Nothing. It's silly. I'll tell you later.

07:28.532 --> 07:30.576
I love mysterious Rebecca.

07:31.535 --> 07:35.372
Hey, guys. Are we sure
that Zava has the right address?

07:35.372 --> 07:37.833
I'd hate to think he's sitting
in the middle of Virginia right now

07:37.833 --> 07:39.459
waiting on us, you know?

07:40.169 --> 07:42.546
So, I just talked
to legal about Zava's contract.

07:42.546 --> 07:45.632
An e-signature is 100% binding.

07:45.632 --> 07:49.553
Tiny wrinkle, instead of signing his name,
he signed "You're welcome."

07:49.553 --> 07:51.513
Shit. What are we going to do?

07:51.513 --> 07:54.016
Hey, look,
superstars play by their own rules.

07:54.016 --> 07:56.727
Back in '98,
I waited over three hours for Public Enemy

07:56.727 --> 07:58.979
to take the stage
of this joint called The Cubby Bear.

07:58.979 --> 08:01.523
When a man with a giant clock
around his neck is that late,

08:01.523 --> 08:02.566
it ain't about time.

08:02.566 --> 08:03.609
He's making a statement.

08:05.068 --> 08:09.698
Right, I'm calling it. We're going to go
upstairs and figure out what we do next.

08:09.698 --> 08:13.535
Leslie, I want you to talk to the crowd
and tell them something.

08:13.535 --> 08:15.287
Of course, Rebecca. I got this.

08:15.287 --> 08:18.582
Back in uni, my deejay name
was Damage Control.

08:18.582 --> 08:19.833
I didn't know you deejayed.

08:19.833 --> 08:22.461
I didn't actually, but I had
the name ready if I ever started.

08:22.461 --> 08:24.254
- Shit. Right, come on, let's go.
- Yeah.

08:31.178 --> 08:33.096
Welcome to the Dogtrack.

08:33.096 --> 08:34.640
Who the fuck are you?

08:38.143 --> 08:42.356
I can't believe this is happening.
Why does anyone put up with this lunatic?

08:42.356 --> 08:44.858
Because as humans,
we adapt to accommodate genius.

08:45.359 --> 08:46.735
Who is the greatest actor alive?

08:46.735 --> 08:48.153
Or was, before he retired.

08:48.153 --> 08:49.988
- Daniel Day-Lewis.
- Tony Curtis.

08:49.988 --> 08:53.700
You said alive? Jackie Chan.
Wait, you said retired? Daniel Day-Lewis.

08:53.700 --> 08:57.329
Exactly. When he gets in character,
he stays in character,

08:57.329 --> 08:59.414
and everyone else adapts to him.

08:59.414 --> 09:01.375
Did you know, that when he made <i>Lincoln</i>

09:01.375 --> 09:04.044
he actually texted Sally Field
as Abraham Lincoln?

09:04.044 --> 09:07.089
Well, that's ridiculous.
Abraham Lincoln couldn't text.

09:07.089 --> 09:08.924
Exactly.
Every time he looked down at his phone,

09:08.924 --> 09:10.092
his hat would fall off.

09:11.051 --> 09:15.722
Look, this Zava might be a genius,
but he's definitely a self-absorbed prick.

09:17.432 --> 09:19.977
Your desk is covered in biscuit crumbs.

09:19.977 --> 09:24.189
What the fuck are you doing?
We've waited two hours for you.

09:24.773 --> 09:28.235
Time is a construct,
like gender and many of the alphabets.

09:28.235 --> 09:29.903
Get out of my chair!

09:32.531 --> 09:33.615
This is your manager.

09:33.615 --> 09:35.325
Hey, how you doing? I'm Ted Lasso.

09:39.705 --> 09:40.706
My leader,

09:41.498 --> 09:44.751
I am an empty vessel filled with gold.

09:46.545 --> 09:49.631
I am your rock. Mold me.

09:51.008 --> 09:52.801
Well, hey,
if you score goals like you talk,

09:52.801 --> 09:53.886
we gonna be just fine, buddy.

09:55.262 --> 09:56.805
Right. And this is Keeley Jones.

09:56.805 --> 09:59.474
- She handles all our publicity.
- Hi.

10:00.851 --> 10:02.060
My queen.

10:03.353 --> 10:06.148
My actions today have made
your job much more difficult.

10:06.148 --> 10:10.319
No, don't worry about it.
No such thing as bad press, right?

10:10.319 --> 10:13.155
My integrity disallows me to agree
with that statement.

10:13.155 --> 10:16.116
- For God's sake.
- He's allergic to hummus.

10:16.116 --> 10:20.412
- Yeah, I know, I know.
- Oh, my God. You're here.

10:21.663 --> 10:22.664
And you are there.

10:22.664 --> 10:25.501
And this is Leslie Higgins,
our director of football.

10:32.674 --> 10:34.343
You are the glue.

10:37.429 --> 10:38.514
Thank you very much.

10:43.018 --> 10:44.478
I will go see the team now.

10:50.817 --> 10:52.986
Do you even know where you're going?

10:52.986 --> 10:54.071
I do not!

10:58.200 --> 11:00.452
Are you kidding me? Wowie zowie.

11:01.411 --> 11:04.498
You know what, maybe I
oughta tag along in case he gets nervous.

11:04.498 --> 11:06.875
Seems like he can be
a little bit of a wallflower.

11:08.335 --> 11:10.003
Great. And now I'm in a rush.

11:10.003 --> 11:13.131
Leslie, tell me,
how did the damage control go?

11:13.131 --> 11:17.010
- It was a mess, but he was adorable.
- Thank you.

11:17.845 --> 11:20.430
- Who is this?
- This is Shandy. We work together.

11:21.431 --> 11:22.558
And she's a great friend of mine.

11:26.520 --> 11:28.689
- Hey, did Zava come through here?
- He's here? You saw him?

11:28.689 --> 11:30.524
Yeah, he was upstairs just a second ago.

11:30.524 --> 11:31.984
- What? He's here?
- He's here!

11:31.984 --> 11:34.027
- In this building?
- Yes. He should be here.

11:34.027 --> 11:35.320
Oh, my God.

11:37.656 --> 11:39.825
Okay, maybe we should all
just split up and go--

11:39.825 --> 11:41.243
Oy.

11:53.547 --> 11:54.631
He touched me.

12:02.806 --> 12:04.099
He's like an angel.

12:06.310 --> 12:10.731
Why are you downgrading him?
He is clearly a god.

12:25.704 --> 12:30.334
I will begin by addressing
the most important person in this room.

12:33.462 --> 12:35.130
Which of you is the kit man?

12:39.760 --> 12:41.094
Yeah, he usually--

12:43.764 --> 12:46.642
That's me. I'm Will.

12:46.642 --> 12:47.643
I am...

12:49.394 --> 12:51.355
- Will.
- Yep.

12:56.777 --> 13:02.241
I too worked as a ball boy
for a club when I was just 11 years old.

13:02.241 --> 13:03.784
I'm 25.

13:03.784 --> 13:05.035
Your passion...

13:07.246 --> 13:08.455
is why I play.

13:11.875 --> 13:12.876
And you.

13:16.839 --> 13:17.881
My team.

13:20.259 --> 13:21.552
My brothers.

13:22.427 --> 13:23.762
Breathe with me.

13:27.558 --> 13:28.892
Right now? Okay, here we go.

14:01.633 --> 14:03.135
We are now one.

14:04.970 --> 14:06.013
There is no me.

14:07.931 --> 14:09.141
There is no you.

14:10.100 --> 14:12.311
There is only the "we"...

14:14.938 --> 14:16.064
and the "us."

14:20.444 --> 14:21.528
And the we in us.

14:30.370 --> 14:31.455
Okay, so...

14:35.792 --> 14:36.960
Okay.

14:37.628 --> 14:39.505
Coaches, let's go in here,

14:39.505 --> 14:41.715
have a word really quickly,
before he scurries off.

14:41.715 --> 14:44.218
Everybody else, just go ahead
and keep breathing amongst yourselves.

14:44.218 --> 14:46.762
He's so much more down-to-earth
than I imagined.

14:46.762 --> 14:47.888
- Right?
- Wow.

15:06.198 --> 15:08.450
Which one of these is me?

15:09.868 --> 15:11.161
You're the fucking coach.

15:12.704 --> 15:14.873
You know what,
we were thinking the top right.

15:14.873 --> 15:16.959
- Fuck's sake.
- Or left, or left, or left.

15:16.959 --> 15:18.710
Whichever one you want really.

15:44.236 --> 15:46.446
I am very excited to be here.

15:47.573 --> 15:49.241
- Hey, we're very excited--
- I will see you tomorrow.

15:49.241 --> 15:50.325
Yep.

15:57.875 --> 15:58.959
He's tall.

16:21.315 --> 16:22.441
Rebecca?

16:23.525 --> 16:25.444
- Tish. Hello there.
- Come in.

16:31.909 --> 16:32.910
Come through.

16:37.497 --> 16:39.124
Please make yourself at home.

16:48.383 --> 16:50.969
Yeah, just take a seat. Relax.

16:55.432 --> 16:57.351
Would you like something to drink?

16:57.351 --> 17:00.854
Water? Tea? Or cocktail, perhaps?

17:00.854 --> 17:03.607
Sure, I'll have a White Russian, thanks.

17:04.608 --> 17:06.527
Yeah, I'm afraid I'm fresh out of Kahlúa

17:07.361 --> 17:11.698
after hosting a <i>Big Lebowski</i>
themed birthday party for a colleague.

17:11.698 --> 17:13.157
But would straight vodka suffice?

17:13.157 --> 17:15.868
I was literally just making a joke.

17:15.868 --> 17:19.414
I know. Which is why I made two.

17:30.634 --> 17:32.719
You have been through a lot recently.

17:36.056 --> 17:40.853
The dark soul of one man
just disconnected you from your own.

17:42.145 --> 17:48.569
And then another beautiful
and worthy soul, in a man half your age,

17:48.569 --> 17:52.072
arrived exactly at the right time.
And the wrong time.

17:52.698 --> 17:54.074
Sorry, how do you know that?

17:54.908 --> 17:58.579
Well, I speak to your mother once a month
for the last six years.

18:00.205 --> 18:01.957
So, Rebecca, how can I help you?

18:03.500 --> 18:04.918
I'm not sure you can.

18:05.919 --> 18:08.338
A skeptic. Well, I shouldn't be surprised.

18:08.338 --> 18:10.674
Because you're supposed to be a psychic?

18:10.674 --> 18:11.800
Oh, no.

18:13.552 --> 18:15.304
Because your mother was a skeptic.

18:18.932 --> 18:21.518
Are you familiar with kintsugi?

18:22.019 --> 18:26.815
It's the Japanese art of mending
broken things with gold.

18:26.815 --> 18:27.983
It--

18:27.983 --> 18:33.238
The idea is that we embrace
the flaws and the imperfections,

18:33.238 --> 18:37.284
and in doing so create something
much stronger and more beautiful.

18:39.953 --> 18:40.954
So...

18:42.915 --> 18:45.918
we are going to place our hands
on the bowl.

18:45.918 --> 18:47.294
Would you?

18:57.888 --> 18:58.889
Sorry, what's that--

19:02.392 --> 19:04.228
Smells very odd in here all of a sudden.

19:05.395 --> 19:06.563
Thank you.

19:09.274 --> 19:10.567
Let's begin.

19:15.239 --> 19:16.698
I can see something.

19:18.450 --> 19:22.079
It's in your hand.
An object. It's very special.

19:22.746 --> 19:23.830
Is it a bowl?

19:25.791 --> 19:27.167
It's a green matchbook.

19:28.335 --> 19:29.795
Sorry, it's what?

19:30.671 --> 19:32.840
A green matchbook. How lovely.

19:33.423 --> 19:35.259
Sorry, who cares about a green matchbook?

19:36.009 --> 19:37.386
Now I can hear something.

19:38.387 --> 19:39.638
Shite!

19:39.638 --> 19:40.889
Oh, for God's sake.

19:43.892 --> 19:45.477
No, just one at a time, please.

19:45.477 --> 19:46.478
I--

19:46.979 --> 19:50.065
Shite in wh-- Shite in nin-- Sh--

19:50.983 --> 19:53.360
Yeah, shite in nining armor.

19:53.360 --> 19:56.530
"A shite in nining armor"?

19:57.239 --> 19:59.700
- Does that mean something to you?
- Yes, it does mean something to me.

19:59.700 --> 20:01.535
It means you're even more batshit crazy
than I--

20:01.535 --> 20:04.955
Shut up, I can hear something else.
It's thunder and lightning and you.

20:04.955 --> 20:09.084
And you're upside down,
and you're drenched.

20:09.084 --> 20:10.335
But you're safe.

20:10.335 --> 20:14.339
Okay, that--
that's enough I think for today.

20:14.339 --> 20:19.720
But thank you so much for your time
and for sharing your,

20:20.554 --> 20:21.805
what is it, your gift?

20:23.557 --> 20:25.684
We can just tell my mum
I did the whole session. Yes?

20:26.852 --> 20:28.228
You will have a family.

20:31.315 --> 20:32.858
Sorry, what did you just say?

20:34.401 --> 20:35.611
You're going to be a mother.

20:37.696 --> 20:38.780
Fuck you.

20:40.407 --> 20:42.534
I've always thought
you were completely harmless

20:42.534 --> 20:45.495
because my mum could afford you,
but you are actually dangerous.

20:47.247 --> 20:48.624
And you're fucking cruel.

20:58.258 --> 21:00.636
So, boys, exciting stuff.

21:00.636 --> 21:03.138
We've got a lot of interview requests
coming in for all of you.

21:03.847 --> 21:05.766
I'd love to get the word out
about the restaurant.

21:05.766 --> 21:10.229
Well, right now the press would like
to focus on Zava joining the team.

21:10.229 --> 21:11.313
Yeah, okay.

21:11.313 --> 21:13.524
I would rather talk
about Zava than myself any day.

21:13.524 --> 21:15.025
What do you want us to say?

21:15.025 --> 21:17.653
Well, that's up to you.
Go for it. Say anything.

21:17.653 --> 21:21.448
I would just, you know,
stay positive, light. Right?

21:21.949 --> 21:26.161
Or say something so shocking
your interview goes viral.

21:27.538 --> 21:29.039
Like you eat your own hair.

21:29.039 --> 21:30.457
No, I--

21:32.125 --> 21:34.837
Well... Hi, Roy.

21:34.837 --> 21:37.005
Keeley, sorry to interrupt.

21:37.005 --> 21:38.090
No.

21:38.090 --> 21:41.301
Higgins told me
to check in on some dumb interview shit.

21:42.511 --> 21:47.099
I mean, some important interview shit.

21:47.099 --> 21:49.560
Don't worry,
nobody in the press wants to talk to you.

21:50.143 --> 21:52.020
No, no. That's not actually true.

21:52.020 --> 21:54.189
The press knows that Roy
doesn't love doing interviews.

21:54.189 --> 21:57.568
Yeah, but it's okay. I'll do one for you
if you need me to.

21:57.568 --> 21:59.319
- Thanks, Roy.
- I'll interview you.

22:00.320 --> 22:01.655
Why'd you dump my friend?

22:01.655 --> 22:03.156
<i>Ay, ay, ay.</i>

22:05.784 --> 22:06.952
You're fun.

22:07.536 --> 22:09.037
Who the fuck is this?

22:09.037 --> 22:10.622
This is Shandy. We work together.

22:11.206 --> 22:13.166
- Why?
- She's an old friend of mine.

22:13.166 --> 22:14.918
That makes more sense.

22:14.918 --> 22:16.753
Shandy. I definitely told you about her.

22:17.838 --> 22:20.841
Oh, yeah. Shandy.

22:22.384 --> 22:24.094
You used to eat your own hair, right?

22:24.928 --> 22:27.514
Yeah. I did.

22:29.391 --> 22:33.979
Well, nice to put a face to the hair.

22:43.739 --> 22:45.240
Hey, Coach.

22:45.240 --> 22:46.366
What's today's Wordle?

22:46.366 --> 22:48.076
- Ethic.
- Ethic.

22:50.787 --> 22:51.830
You're a jerk.

22:53.874 --> 22:56.335
- Hey, Jamie. How you doing?
- Can I talk to you for a minute?

22:56.335 --> 22:57.961
Yeah, you can talk to me
as long as you want.

22:57.961 --> 23:00.297
Though I do have a tendency
to doze off around 1:00 a.m.

23:00.297 --> 23:02.257
- What's up?
- So look--

23:07.554 --> 23:09.139
I know we're all excited Zava's here.

23:09.139 --> 23:12.726
Yeah, I get that.
But I know a lot of players like him,

23:12.726 --> 23:14.937
and they're all just
self-absorbed glory hunters

23:14.937 --> 23:16.647
who only care about themselves.

23:22.069 --> 23:22.903
Jamie,

23:22.903 --> 23:27.908
don't you think that coming from you
that's a little bit ironic?

23:30.202 --> 23:31.328
Don't know.

23:33.163 --> 23:36.750
But look, the point is,
we don't need this guy.

23:36.750 --> 23:40.337
I think we've got a good thing going here,
and he's already fucking it all up.

23:41.088 --> 23:43.173
Hey, Jamie,
I hear what you're saying, man.

23:43.757 --> 23:46.510
But I think we've got to give it
a game or two and see what's what.

23:48.220 --> 23:50.389
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
Yeah, no, yeah. Course, yeah.

23:50.389 --> 23:53.225
Well, thanks for hearing me out.

23:53.225 --> 23:56.645
Aight. Thanks for speaking your mind.
Please continue to do so.

23:56.645 --> 23:57.729
Yeah.

23:58.689 --> 23:59.898
And-- And I--

23:59.898 --> 24:03.652
I weren't being ironic,
I was being hypocritical. That's it.

24:06.822 --> 24:07.698
Is that right?

24:09.992 --> 24:12.327
- Yes or no?
- Yes.

24:13.787 --> 24:15.205
So that was actually ironic.

24:18.208 --> 24:21.962
<i>Good afternoon. There is
an electricity today at Nelson Road,</i>

24:21.962 --> 24:26.258
and the cause of all this excitement
goes by one name, Zava.

24:26.842 --> 24:29.052
Like Pelé, if every letter was different.

24:30.888 --> 24:34.266
There are more VIPs here
than London Fashion Week.

24:34.933 --> 24:36.226
I assume. I don't know.

24:36.226 --> 24:38.353
This is all 'cause you got Zava, babe.

24:38.353 --> 24:40.314
You've made Richmond fucking global.

24:46.403 --> 24:48.739
All right. Pop quiz, hotshots.

24:48.739 --> 24:52.075
What do you get when you combine
one of Hugh Jackman's finest film roles

24:52.075 --> 24:54.203
with a fancy-pants New York City getaway?

24:54.203 --> 24:55.787
Jean Valjean Catskills?

24:56.538 --> 24:59.499
No. That's a great answer, Sam.
How do you know about the Catskills?

24:59.499 --> 25:00.876
<i>Marvelous Mrs. Maisel</i>.

25:00.876 --> 25:02.503
Yeah. That's a good show.

25:02.503 --> 25:04.129
Yeah. I respect that. Word.

25:04.129 --> 25:08.050
No, the answer I was looking for actually
was today's opponents, Wolverhampton.

25:08.050 --> 25:10.719
- Full name, Wolverhampton Wanderers.
- Thank you.

25:10.719 --> 25:12.763
- Also known as the Wanderers.
- No.

25:12.763 --> 25:14.223
Also known as Wolves.

25:14.223 --> 25:17.643
Okay. So, our opponents today are
the Wolverhampton Wandering Wolves.

25:17.643 --> 25:20.395
- No.
- Just Wolverhampton or Wolves.

25:20.395 --> 25:24.608
Got it. So when the team
known as Wolverhampton, or Wolves,

25:24.608 --> 25:27.903
is wandering around the pitch today
trying to score some soccer goals,

25:27.903 --> 25:29.071
here's the game plan.

25:29.071 --> 25:30.322
Take it away, fellas.

25:30.322 --> 25:32.533
All right, here's your starters.
Here's your subs.

25:32.533 --> 25:35.285
Now remember,
this 4-5-1 is not about dropping back.

25:35.285 --> 25:38.872
It's about getting fucking service
into the box for Zava.

25:38.872 --> 25:39.873
Got it?

25:40.666 --> 25:41.667
Are you all right?

25:43.168 --> 25:45.170
I am still a strong and capable man.

25:46.547 --> 25:47.548
You're all right.

25:47.548 --> 25:49.967
- All free kicks will be taken by...
- Zava.

25:49.967 --> 25:51.510
- All penalties...
- Zava.

25:51.510 --> 25:54.137
- All corners...
- Anyone to Zava.

25:54.137 --> 25:57.558
That's it. You fellas set 'em up,
and our man Zava's gonna--

25:59.643 --> 26:02.396
Well, he's gonna knock 'em down.
Okay? Yeah.

26:06.567 --> 26:08.694
Okay. Let's bring it in. Come on. Here.

26:17.744 --> 26:18.745
Zava.

26:21.331 --> 26:22.249
Zava.

26:23.750 --> 26:25.419
Am I supposed
to hit the gong or something?

26:25.419 --> 26:27.087
What's up with that shit?

26:33.218 --> 26:34.094
No.

26:37.639 --> 26:38.891
Okay.

26:38.891 --> 26:40.100
I am ready.

26:40.100 --> 26:42.394
Okay. Nicely done.

26:43.729 --> 26:44.980
Okay. Here we go.

26:44.980 --> 26:48.650
All right. Okay, Captain,
why don't you go ahead and flip it--

26:51.320 --> 26:54.281
Richmond on three. One, two, three.

26:54.281 --> 26:57.826
Richmond!

26:59.828 --> 27:00.954
He's strong.

27:04.333 --> 27:05.334
Yeah.

27:07.044 --> 27:09.213
- The Precious Moments figurine.
- Little bitch.

27:13.217 --> 27:15.594
- How much time we got, Coach?
- Exactly four minutes.

27:15.594 --> 27:16.762
Okay, great.

27:16.762 --> 27:18.639
I'm gonna call Henry real quick.
Wish him luck.

27:18.639 --> 27:20.349
His soccer team starts the playoffs today.

27:20.349 --> 27:21.975
- Nice.
- Yeah.

27:23.060 --> 27:24.728
- Uh-oh.
- What's wrong?

27:24.728 --> 27:26.396
I can't find my phone.

27:28.065 --> 27:29.525
Shoot, I know where it is.

27:30.400 --> 27:32.486
I left it sitting on my bathroom sink.
Dang it.

27:32.486 --> 27:34.738
That's what you get
for playing <i>Tetris</i> on the toilet.

27:35.822 --> 27:36.907
Yeah, that and numb legs.

27:36.907 --> 27:39.284
You know, that's all right,
I'll persevere. I'll go old school.

27:43.205 --> 27:44.581
- Uh-oh.
- What now?

27:45.791 --> 27:47.876
I can't remember
Michelle's cell phone number.

27:49.419 --> 27:50.420
Yeah.

27:50.420 --> 27:53.215
- Is that a good thing or a bad thing?
- I think it's just a thing.

27:54.091 --> 27:55.092
Well, yeah.

27:56.260 --> 27:58.095
- You okay?
- Yeah. No, no.

27:58.095 --> 28:01.223
I'll just call the house. No, I--
No, I'm good. I'll be right out.

28:04.434 --> 28:08.313
Henry, we gotta go!
And don't forget your shin guards!

28:08.313 --> 28:09.523
Okay!

28:10.107 --> 28:12.109
- Thanks again for driving.
- Yeah, no problem.

28:15.070 --> 28:18.156
- You still have a landline?
- Yeah. I don't know why.

28:19.825 --> 28:21.243
Are you gonna answer it?

28:21.243 --> 28:23.620
No. It's probably a telemarketer.

28:23.620 --> 28:25.038
Henry, let's go!

28:26.164 --> 28:27.332
May I answer it?

28:27.332 --> 28:29.626
I have a thing for messing
with telemarketers.

28:30.210 --> 28:32.838
- Knock yourself out.
- Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

28:32.838 --> 28:34.298
Watch this.

28:35.382 --> 28:39.052
Hello. You've reached the house
of Michelle Keller.

28:39.052 --> 28:42.556
Who by the way is doing amazing things
with orange slices these days.

28:42.556 --> 28:45.017
You're gonna be amazed.
It's really spectacular.

28:45.017 --> 28:46.268
How can I help you?

28:46.268 --> 28:48.145
Well, hey, Mr. Former President.

28:48.145 --> 28:49.855
Boy, have I got a bone to pick with you.

28:52.900 --> 28:53.901
<i>Hello?</i>

28:57.237 --> 28:58.238
<i>Hello?</i>

29:01.450 --> 29:02.451
Ted.

29:03.619 --> 29:06.914
- Yeah. Who is this?
- This is Jacob Bryanson.

29:07.706 --> 29:08.707
Dr. Jacob?

29:08.707 --> 29:11.668
<i>Yeah. Ted, you can just call me Jake.</i>

29:13.253 --> 29:14.254
Dr. Jacob.

29:14.254 --> 29:16.256
Henry, come on!

29:16.256 --> 29:17.633
Michelle. Michelle.

29:18.717 --> 29:20.761
- What?
- It's Ted.

29:25.015 --> 29:26.016
Shit.

29:28.435 --> 29:30.562
- <i>Hi, Ted.</i>
- Hey.

29:30.562 --> 29:31.688
Found 'em!

29:32.272 --> 29:35.067
Hey, sweetie. Do you want
to talk to Daddy really quick?

29:35.067 --> 29:37.444
- Dad.
- Hey, buddy.

29:37.444 --> 29:40.322
We're playing the Dragons today,
and they're undefeated.

29:40.322 --> 29:42.991
Yeah, well, you know they ain't gonna
be undefeated for long. Am I right?

29:44.868 --> 29:47.079
Hey, look, I was just calling
to wish you good luck.

29:47.079 --> 29:48.664
<i>Good luck to you too, Dad</i>.

29:48.664 --> 29:52.668
And please tell Zava that many
of my friends' moms like his abs.

29:52.668 --> 29:53.836
Will do.

29:53.836 --> 29:55.212
- Bye.
- <i>Bye.</i>

29:56.004 --> 29:57.381
Thank you, sweetie.

29:57.381 --> 29:58.799
Ted, just one second, okay?

29:58.799 --> 29:59.883
<i>Do you wanna wait in the car?</i>

29:59.883 --> 30:03.053
- <i>Do you wanna take him to the-- Thank you.</i>
- <i>Yes. Of course. Come on, bud.</i>

30:03.053 --> 30:05.055
<i>You ever seen a sunroof? Pretty cool.</i>

30:09.059 --> 30:10.686
Hi. Sorry.

30:12.271 --> 30:14.314
<i>Can we chat when we both have more time?</i>

30:15.524 --> 30:16.942
<i>There's a lot to catch up on.</i>

30:18.318 --> 30:19.611
Yeah. No, of course.

30:20.445 --> 30:22.781
All good. I'll talk to you later.

30:23.824 --> 30:26.994
<i>Ted, I-- Good luck today.</i>

30:27.911 --> 30:28.912
Thanks.

30:40.924 --> 30:43.969
<i>The Richmond faithful
return to their beloved Dogtrack</i>

30:43.969 --> 30:46.638
<i>for the first time
this Premier League season,</i>

30:46.638 --> 30:50.058
<i>and surely when they see
the name Zava on the team sheet,</i>

30:50.058 --> 30:52.269
<i>they'll think they've died
and gone to heaven.</i>

30:53.604 --> 30:56.064
Come on! Let's go! Let's do it!

31:00.485 --> 31:01.486
Tartt.

31:04.615 --> 31:05.616
What's he doing now?

31:07.326 --> 31:08.327
Yeah?

31:09.328 --> 31:12.873
Get open. I will find you.

31:21.215 --> 31:22.508
Come on, boys! Come on!

31:28.055 --> 31:29.264
Let's go, boys.

31:44.571 --> 31:46.532
<i>My word, he's done it!</i>

31:46.532 --> 31:50.953
<i>Zava has scored from the halfway line
seconds into his debut,</i>

31:51.453 --> 31:54.540
<i>and the Dogtrack is in a state of rapture.</i>

31:56.500 --> 31:58.418
- Yeah. All right.
- He might be pretty good.

31:58.919 --> 32:00.879
- Here we go.
- I could get used to this shit.

32:02.130 --> 32:05.384
- Zava! Zava!
- Yes. Yes. Yay.

32:18.146 --> 32:21.316
<i>Bumbercatch with the cross.
It's a tricky one for Zava.</i>

32:23.068 --> 32:27.030
- <i>I cannot believe what I just saw.</i>
- What?

32:27.030 --> 32:31.702
<i>Zava with the scorpion kick,
and Burnley feel the sting.</i>

32:35.956 --> 32:41.753
Om.

32:44.047 --> 32:47.301
Om.

33:00.230 --> 33:04.985
<i>Richmond up 2-nil over Palace,
who have simply had no answer for Zava.</i>

33:04.985 --> 33:06.486
<i>The corner comes in,</i>

33:06.486 --> 33:10.824
<i>And it's that man again!
Zava, with a towering header!</i>

33:12.284 --> 33:14.828
<i>Soaring like an eagle amongst penguins.</i>

33:42.189 --> 33:43.941
- How do you do?
- Morning.

33:46.443 --> 33:47.694
I think it's good.

33:48.820 --> 33:50.239
And then maybe do a--

33:50.239 --> 33:52.324
I think we should put it in.
Do you think we should?

34:18.433 --> 34:20.853
<i>Rojas finds Tartt.</i>

34:20.853 --> 34:25.065
<i>Still seeking his first goal
of the season, is this the moment?</i>

34:25.065 --> 34:27.985
<i>No, it's Zava again!</i>

34:27.985 --> 34:31.487
Zava, Zava, Zava, Zava!

34:31.487 --> 34:34.157
<i>He may have stolen the goal
from Jamie Tartt,</i>

34:34.157 --> 34:37.369
<i>but you can't argue
with the instincts of a champion.</i>

34:39.580 --> 34:40.746
<i>If you're a Richmond fan,</i>

34:40.746 --> 34:44.418
<i>you've gotta feel that with Zava
everything is going your way.</i>

34:45.752 --> 34:46.837
I got a job!

35:00.726 --> 35:01.560
Thank you.

35:01.560 --> 35:03.729
I mean, the whole thing is just crazy,
you know.

35:03.729 --> 35:05.689
He was supposed to be
helping us get back together.

35:06.273 --> 35:07.357
You know what I mean?

35:07.357 --> 35:10.694
It always bothered me the way he'd be
like, "I'm sorry, our time is up."

35:10.694 --> 35:12.237
<i>Sorry, our time is up.</i>

35:12.237 --> 35:14.531
Nah, that's not quite it.
It was a lot more condescending.

35:14.531 --> 35:16.241
It was more like, "I'm so sorry."

35:16.241 --> 35:19.203
<i>Ted, I'm talking about our session.
Our time is up.</i>

35:19.203 --> 35:21.872
Oh, right. Sorry I didn't get
to ask any personal questions.

35:21.872 --> 35:23.540
I was just yammering.

35:24.458 --> 35:26.543
Wow. Gone. Okay.

35:28.170 --> 35:29.171
Gotta respect it.

35:30.130 --> 35:33.509
George, is Ted Lasso
the coach of the year?

35:33.509 --> 35:36.220
What? Writing the name Zava
on the team sheet?

35:36.220 --> 35:39.264
Come on. Gimme a break, Jeff.
That's not coaching.

35:39.264 --> 35:41.892
No. What Nathan Shelley's doing
over at West Ham,

35:41.892 --> 35:44.228
now that is a tactician at work.

35:44.937 --> 35:46.063
Yeah, I like West Ham.

35:46.772 --> 35:47.773
But I love Zava.

35:47.773 --> 35:49.149
Don't we all, mate?

35:54.571 --> 35:58.116
<i>We're in stoppage time
of what has been an unforgettable contest.</i>

35:58.116 --> 36:00.369
<i>Richmond surely would be happy
with a draw,</i>

36:00.369 --> 36:03.580
<i>but here's Rojas with a chance
to steal an historic victory</i>

36:03.580 --> 36:05.249
<i>over Manchester United.</i>

36:14.383 --> 36:18.178
<i>Zava with a God-like bicycle kick
in injury time.</i>

36:18.178 --> 36:20.305
<i>And surely Richmond have won it.</i>

36:20.305 --> 36:26.270
<i>A Zava hat trick bringing their first ever
victory in the Theatre of Dreams.</i>

36:29.273 --> 36:32.109
Yes! Yeah, yeah, yeah!

36:34.653 --> 36:35.654
Fuck it!

36:40.367 --> 36:42.578
<i>And with this victory over Brentford</i>

36:42.578 --> 36:45.122
<i>that's six wins on the bounce for Richmond</i>

36:45.122 --> 36:48.208
<i>in this Zava-fueled miracle streak.</i>

36:54.131 --> 36:56.425
You ever think your book
would be a fucking fairy tale?

36:56.425 --> 36:57.926
Come on!

37:02.097 --> 37:04.808
Yo! Yo, yo, yo! Hey!
Guys, guys, guys. Yo, yo. Check it out.

37:04.808 --> 37:07.895
Listen. Tomorrow,
everybody is invited to the restaurant.

37:11.148 --> 37:13.025
We're still a few weeks
from officially opening.

37:13.025 --> 37:15.152
So please, lower your expectations.

37:15.152 --> 37:16.445
But it's gonna be an open bar!

37:27.289 --> 37:30.626
Zava, Zava, Zava, Zava, Zava, Zava!

37:34.546 --> 37:37.758
- Okay. Okay. What do I need? Hey.
- Hey. Don't serve my food with that face.

37:38.383 --> 37:39.384
Okay.

37:40.969 --> 37:41.970
Oh, man.

37:43.013 --> 37:44.181
- Hey.
- Sam, this place is lovely.

37:44.181 --> 37:46.350
- Have a great night.
- Thank you. Nice seeing you.

37:46.350 --> 37:48.810
- Super great place.
- Yeah.

37:48.810 --> 37:50.437
Thank you. I'll come and catch you, yeah?

37:50.437 --> 37:51.939
- Peace.
- All right. I'll see you later.

37:51.939 --> 37:54.983
- Hello. Okay. This is for you.
- The smell.

37:54.983 --> 37:56.443
- That's for you.
- Nice.

37:56.443 --> 37:59.071
Mate, this is the best moimoi
I've ever tasted in my life.

37:59.071 --> 38:00.906
Thanks, man.

38:01.740 --> 38:04.535
- Look at me. I'm not kidding.
- Hey.

38:04.535 --> 38:06.119
Thank you. Thanks.

38:06.745 --> 38:10.290
Sam, is Zava coming?
I made him a friendship bracelet.

38:10.290 --> 38:12.626
Well, I invited him. I guess we'll see.

38:12.626 --> 38:13.836
Cool, man.

38:13.836 --> 38:15.504
Okay, you guys. Enjoy the food, okay?

38:15.504 --> 38:16.588
- All right?
- Cool, bro.

38:17.089 --> 38:19.466
- Colin.
- Hi, hi.

38:20.092 --> 38:21.760
- Doing good?
- Yeah, you okay?

38:21.760 --> 38:23.345
Boyos, this is my pal Michael.

38:23.345 --> 38:24.847
- Hiya.
- What's up, man?

38:24.847 --> 38:27.891
- World's greatest wingman.
- Yeah. Tough gig.

38:27.891 --> 38:30.811
"Hello, young lady.
My friend's a professional footballer.

38:30.811 --> 38:33.021
May I spend all night talking
to your cross-eyed friend

38:33.021 --> 38:34.690
while he hits on you poorly?"

38:38.068 --> 38:40.195
What did you decide after Tish's reading?

38:40.195 --> 38:42.906
- Are you gonna go back and see her?
- No. No, no.

38:42.906 --> 38:45.784
It's not for me. If I wanted to be scammed
out of all my money,

38:45.784 --> 38:48.245
I'd go the old-fashioned route
and become obsessively religious.

38:48.245 --> 38:49.788
Cheers to that.

38:49.788 --> 38:53.208
Well, if it isn't Beauty and the Stink!

38:53.208 --> 38:54.793
Get out! Sassy!

38:55.627 --> 38:57.713
Oh, my God!

38:59.715 --> 39:01.258
Hey, ladies.

39:01.258 --> 39:03.468
- Hi.
- Welcome to Ola's.

39:03.468 --> 39:06.430
- I'm so happy to see all of you.
- Thanks for having us, Sam.

39:06.430 --> 39:09.016
No, thank you for coming. Please,
make sure you enjoy yourselves, okay?

39:09.016 --> 39:11.101
- Absolutely. Thanks.
- Cheers!

39:11.101 --> 39:12.186
Thank you.

39:15.022 --> 39:16.023
You are such a twat.

39:16.607 --> 39:19.943
- Oi. What can I get you to drink?
- Champagne, please.

39:19.943 --> 39:21.904
Champagne? Can we get another champagne?

39:21.904 --> 39:23.363
Is Ted here?

39:24.281 --> 39:25.324
Told you.

39:26.533 --> 39:27.701
You want a beer, Coach?

39:28.785 --> 39:31.788
Michelle and Henry went horseback riding
with Dr. Jacob today.

39:32.372 --> 39:35.375
We'll take two shots of whiskey.
A single and a double.

39:35.375 --> 39:37.336
A triple. Two.

39:38.212 --> 39:39.630
Weinstein's cock!

39:40.464 --> 39:41.632
Are you cheating on me?

39:41.632 --> 39:42.716
Yeah, I am.

39:43.425 --> 39:44.259
With you.

39:48.847 --> 39:51.600
Man, y'all's baggage
just matches right up, don't it?

40:00.400 --> 40:01.401
See you in a bit.

40:05.614 --> 40:06.949
What the fuck do you want?

40:10.536 --> 40:15.582
You frowning while we're on a win streak,
that's a bad look.

40:16.333 --> 40:17.876
You frowned your whole career.

40:17.876 --> 40:19.753
No, I never smiled. That's different.

40:23.298 --> 40:24.216
Here we go.

40:27.219 --> 40:29.930
- Good game. Good game.
- Yes.

40:29.930 --> 40:31.223
For fuck's sake.

40:31.932 --> 40:34.685
There he is, God's gift to those
who have everything.

40:35.269 --> 40:36.770
Best player on the team.

40:36.770 --> 40:37.855
Fuck off.

40:39.356 --> 40:40.357
It's true.

40:40.941 --> 40:45.112
You used to be the best.
Now you're not. It happens.

40:45.696 --> 40:46.780
You thought I was the best?

40:47.614 --> 40:51.368
Yeah. I mean, you still could be
if you weren't such a pre-Madonna.

40:52.077 --> 40:54.371
- Did you just call me a pre-Madonna?
- Yeah.

40:55.956 --> 40:57.499
It's prima donna.

40:58.500 --> 41:01.920
Who the fuck says "pre-Madonna"?
What the fuck does that even mean?

41:01.920 --> 41:05.674
It means before Madonna, female vocalists
didn't have to work that hard.

41:05.674 --> 41:07.217
Are you mad?

41:07.217 --> 41:09.678
You never heard of Tina Turner?
Fucking Stevie Nicks?

41:09.678 --> 41:12.431
Fuck you. Point is,
he's the best player on the team.

41:13.015 --> 41:15.726
And right now, all you gotta do
is try and keep up with him.

41:15.726 --> 41:18.270
Fuck that.
I don't wanna just keep up with him.

41:19.646 --> 41:21.440
I wanna be better than him.

41:25.152 --> 41:26.195
I could train you.

41:28.280 --> 41:29.907
But only if you fucking mean it.

41:30.407 --> 41:33.410
Yeah. I do mean it.

41:37.164 --> 41:38.165
When do we start then?

41:39.666 --> 41:40.876
Right fucking now.

41:41.710 --> 41:42.878
Come on, man.

41:43.462 --> 41:45.589
So sorry. We'll take care of it.

41:48.050 --> 41:50.052
We start tomorrow. 4:00 a.m.

41:52.179 --> 41:53.514
Clean that up.

41:57.476 --> 41:58.310
All right.

42:00.312 --> 42:02.439
I'm gonna do a lap. If Ted's already gone,

42:02.439 --> 42:05.359
I'm telling you right now,
I will be attempting to scale Mount Zava.

42:06.109 --> 42:08.362
Adieu. Good luck.

42:10.864 --> 42:13.575
Hi. Hello. Hi.

42:13.575 --> 42:15.202
Hi. Hello.

42:15.202 --> 42:17.913
I'm Shandy. I do PR for the club.

42:17.913 --> 42:20.874
It's so great you've come down here,
but don't be a dick.

42:20.874 --> 42:22.835
Show some love on your socials, yeah?

42:24.127 --> 42:28.048
I like your confident energy.
It's off-putting.

42:28.882 --> 42:30.592
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

42:31.385 --> 42:32.678
That's really nice.

42:33.262 --> 42:35.472
So how's it going with Shandy?
Is she fitting in?

42:35.472 --> 42:38.350
Yes, she's great.
I love how not shy she is.

42:40.185 --> 42:41.019
Yeah.

42:50.195 --> 42:51.196
Wish me luck.

42:57.828 --> 42:59.329
Okay. See you later.

43:12.843 --> 43:16.555
Oi. There are better things ahead
than any we leave behind.

43:23.812 --> 43:24.938
Excuse me. One moment.

43:25.480 --> 43:26.982
Hey, hey.

43:26.982 --> 43:29.651
Thank you so much for coming.
Honestly, it means so much to me.

43:29.651 --> 43:33.739
Sam, tell me, where does your restaurant
source its avocados from?

43:34.740 --> 43:38.452
West African cuisine doesn't
typically feature a lot of avocados.

43:39.578 --> 43:40.412
Not yet.

43:45.792 --> 43:48.212
- Marlboro Man.
- Hey. Look who it is.

43:48.212 --> 43:50.005
I didn't know you work here.

43:50.005 --> 43:52.090
Well, how you going?

43:52.090 --> 43:53.800
- I'm doing all right. Yeah.
- Yeah?

43:53.800 --> 43:56.428
Well, my ex-wife's dating
our ex-marriage counselor,

43:56.428 --> 43:58.472
so, you know, that's new.

43:59.181 --> 44:01.850
Wow, that's borderline unethical.

44:01.850 --> 44:05.437
Yeah, well, I mean, it all started a year
and a half after we were seeing him,

44:05.437 --> 44:08.941
so I guess that's-- You ever have anything
like that happen with you and a client?

44:08.941 --> 44:10.776
Ted, I'm a child psychologist.

44:10.776 --> 44:12.653
Right, right.

44:12.653 --> 44:13.737
So, yes. Twice.

44:13.737 --> 44:16.657
Hey. Classic Sassy. I love it.

44:16.657 --> 44:18.825
- Classic Sass.
- Classic Sassy.

44:19.409 --> 44:20.494
I got you a surprise.

44:24.706 --> 44:25.707
What's this?

44:30.128 --> 44:31.129
Thank you.

44:32.047 --> 44:33.507
Oh, my God.

44:33.507 --> 44:35.133
Don't just stand there. Pass them out.

44:40.681 --> 44:41.682
Hey.

44:46.728 --> 44:48.939
- What?
- You're being really clingy right now.

44:49.857 --> 44:50.858
I am so sorry.

44:51.775 --> 44:52.943
Hey.

44:52.943 --> 44:55.988
Ladies, a little something
to commemorate the evening

44:55.988 --> 44:58.699
and to remind you to come back
again and again, right?

44:58.699 --> 44:59.950
Thank you.

44:59.950 --> 45:01.076
No worries.

45:02.619 --> 45:03.537
So chic.

45:07.749 --> 45:08.750
Green.

45:13.130 --> 45:14.548
It's a green matchbook.

45:17.050 --> 45:18.051
You okay?

45:22.097 --> 45:25.726
- Yes. Another round?
- All right. Yeah. Okay.

45:27.269 --> 45:29.521
- Get another round.
- Can we get another round, please?

45:30.480 --> 45:31.899
- Thank you, Sam.
- No worries.

45:31.899 --> 45:33.066
This place is wonderful.

45:33.066 --> 45:34.902
- Food's fantastic.
- Thank you so much for coming.

45:34.902 --> 45:36.612
- Okay, listen, get home safe, okay?
- Okay.
