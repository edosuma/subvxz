WEBVTT

00:00.100 --> 00:01.522
PREVIOUSLY ON "ALL AMERICAN"...

00:01.530 --> 00:03.624
Y'ALL CALLED UP CAMERON
WILSON TO REPLACE ME, HUH?

00:03.630 --> 00:05.928
HEY, AT LEAST THE BROTHER'S WILLING

00:05.930 --> 00:07.238
OH, SO, NOW YOU'RE
GONNA GUARD ME, HUH?

00:07.240 --> 00:09.038
WHY NOT? I ALREADY
TOOK YOUR SPOT.

00:09.040 --> 00:10.633
YOU AIN'T NEVER
GONNA BE ME.

00:10.640 --> 00:12.062
YOU THINK I HAVE
A CHANCE TO BE GREAT?

00:12.070 --> 00:13.970
I DON'T KNOW YET.

00:13.980 --> 00:15.277
WILLIE: THERE YOU GO.
KEEP IT GOING.

00:18.450 --> 00:18.871
AGAIN.

00:18.880 --> 00:20.848
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO COME
UP WITH A WHOLE NEW PLAYBOOK

00:20.850 --> 00:22.716
SINCE SOMEONE GAVE
MALIBU OURS.

00:22.720 --> 00:24.688
AS SOON AS I TELL MY DAD WHAT
YOU DID, YOU'RE OFF THIS TEAM.

00:24.690 --> 00:25.987
YOU SERIOUS RIGHT NOW?

00:25.990 --> 00:27.617
PROBABLY BEST YOU GO STAY
WITH YOUR MOTHER FOR A WHILE.

00:27.620 --> 00:30.726
NO USE YOU BEING HERE
IF YOU'RE OFF THE TEAM.

00:33.360 --> 00:35.419
MAN: FIRST THINGS FIRST,
Y'ALL KNOW WHO I BE

00:35.430 --> 00:38.297
CAPTAIN OF THE TEAM,
SO ALL SALUTE ME

00:38.300 --> 00:39.893
MANY OTHERS TRIED,
BUT THAT AIN'T REAL

00:39.900 --> 00:42.904
PUT THE RACK ON ME,
I'MMA SCORE AT WILL

00:42.910 --> 00:45.663
THAT'S FOR EVERYTHING,
WAY TOO EASY

00:45.670 --> 00:47.672
NO LIES, MAN,
PLEASE BELIEVE ME

00:47.680 --> 00:50.240
BIG GAME NOW
I'M ON ONE, YEAH...

00:50.250 --> 00:51.308
MAN: ON YOUR MARKS.

00:51.310 --> 00:52.971
AND I'M BREAKING ALL
THE RULES TO THE LAST...

00:52.980 --> 00:54.141
GET SET.

00:55.880 --> 00:57.712
WOMEN: ...I GOT
MY WHOLE TEAM ALL IN

00:57.720 --> 01:02.089
FOR ME AND YOU,
THAT'S WHAT I NEED TO DO

01:02.090 --> 01:03.558
BILLY: YOU READY
FOR THE COMBINE?

01:03.560 --> 01:05.221
MAN: MY MAN.
BILLY: GOOD TO SEE YOU.

01:05.230 --> 01:06.459
MAN: GOOD TO SEE YOU, TOO.
BILLY: YOU BEEN WELL?

01:06.460 --> 01:07.291
MAN: YEAH, YEAH.

01:07.300 --> 01:10.827
JORDAN, SPENCER. COME HERE,
BOYS. COME HERE RIGHT QUICK.

01:10.830 --> 01:13.390
I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE YOU TO A
GOOD FRIEND OF MINE--DAMON KING.

01:13.400 --> 01:14.561
WE GO WAY BACK,

01:14.570 --> 01:16.902
BACK TO WHEN I USED TO
BEAT HIS ASS IN THE NFL.

01:16.910 --> 01:17.729
DAMON: OH!

01:17.740 --> 01:19.230
OH, YOUR MEMORY
ALWAYS BEEN THAT BAD?

01:20.310 --> 01:21.903
IT'S COACH KING
NOW, FELLAS.

01:21.910 --> 01:24.140
WIDEOUTS,
ANGELES SOUTHERN UNIVERSITY.

01:24.150 --> 01:25.743
JORDAN BAKER. NICE
TO MEET YOU, SIR.

01:25.750 --> 01:27.070
JORDAN.
THAT'S RIGHT.

01:27.080 --> 01:28.218
MAN, THE LAST TIME
I SAW YOU,

01:28.220 --> 01:29.949
I'M PRETTY SURE
YOU WAS IN DIAPERS.

01:29.950 --> 01:31.543
YOUR DAD SAID YOU GOT A
ROCKET FOR AN ARM, HUH?

01:31.550 --> 01:32.847
EXCITED TO SHOW
IT OFF, SIR.

01:32.850 --> 01:34.056
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
TO PLAY FOR THE WOLVES.

01:34.060 --> 01:34.652
HMM.

01:34.660 --> 01:36.321
BILLY: AND THIS
RIGHT HERE, SPENCER JAMES.

01:36.330 --> 01:37.422
YES, SIR. OH, YEAH.

01:37.430 --> 01:38.829
WE KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

01:38.830 --> 01:40.798
BEVERLY'S FINEST. MAN.

01:40.800 --> 01:41.892
CRENSHAW'S OWN,
ACTUALLY.

01:41.900 --> 01:43.129
WELL, YOU LUCKY
YOU MOVED TO BEVERLY.

01:43.130 --> 01:44.222
OTHERWISE, YOU MIGHT
HAVE MISSED

01:44.230 --> 01:45.823
THE FIRST TWO COMBINES,
YOUNG MAN.

01:45.830 --> 01:47.161
DON'T SLEEP ON CRENSHAW.

01:47.170 --> 01:48.899
WE MAY NOT HAVE
THESE FANCY FACILITIES,

01:48.900 --> 01:50.106
BUT A LOT OF DUDES
THERE CAN PLAY.

01:50.110 --> 01:52.499
OK. I WILL
KEEP THAT IN MIND.

01:52.510 --> 01:53.932
SO, YOU EVER CONSIDERED

01:53.940 --> 01:55.499
ANGELES SOUTHERN
FOR COLLEGE BALL?

01:55.510 --> 01:57.808
<i>Y'ALL GOT ONE OF THE BEST
FOOTBALL PROGRAMS TN LA,.</i>

01:57.810 --> 01:59.505
AND IT'S CLOSE
TO HOME.

01:59.510 --> 02:01.114
AND I SEND AT LEAST
TWO GUYS

02:01.120 --> 02:02.519
TO THE LEAGUE
EVERY SINGLE YEAR.

02:02.520 --> 02:03.988
BILLY: OK,
EASY, EASY.

02:03.990 --> 02:05.742
THE COMBINE HASN'T
EVEN STARTED YET.

02:05.750 --> 02:06.820
YOU'RE ALREADY
IN THE PICTURE.

02:06.820 --> 02:07.855
YOU KNOW THE GAME.

02:07.860 --> 02:08.713
ALL RIGHT.
SPENCER'S GONNA WAIT

02:08.720 --> 02:10.529
FOR THE RECRUITMENT
PROCESS TO PLAY OUT

02:10.530 --> 02:11.884
BEFORE HE MAKES
ANY COMMITMENTS.

02:11.890 --> 02:13.096
LISTEN, DON'T
WAIT TOO LONG.

02:13.100 --> 02:14.295
I ONLY GOT
A COUPLE OF GUYS

02:14.300 --> 02:15.790
GRADUATING AT RECEIVER.

02:15.800 --> 02:17.165
SO, YOU TALKING, LIKE,

02:17.170 --> 02:18.899
WHAT, A COUPLE
SCHOLARSHIPS?

02:18.900 --> 02:20.390
NAH. TALKING ONE.

02:20.400 --> 02:22.767
SPENCER: OH, WOW. HEH.

02:22.770 --> 02:24.499
RIGHT. WELL, I APPRECIATE
THE LOVE,

02:24.510 --> 02:26.899
BUT, LIKE COACH SAID,
I'M KEEPING MY OPTIONS OPEN.

02:29.410 --> 02:31.845
NICE TO MEET YOU.

02:31.850 --> 02:33.841
MAN: FEELING LIKE
I WANT A GOOD TIME

02:33.850 --> 02:36.785
I JUST WANT TO
BE YOURS

02:36.790 --> 02:38.485
'CAUSE I'M RUNNING
OUT OF TIME

02:38.490 --> 02:42.358
AND NOW IT'S RUNNIN'
ME OVER, UHH...

02:42.360 --> 02:44.954
DILLON: I'M THINKING I
SHOULD BE YOUR AGENT.

02:44.960 --> 02:46.553
YOU KNOW, SINCE
YOU'RE ABOUT TO BLOW UP.

02:46.560 --> 02:48.153
WHAT YOU TALKING ABOUT?

02:48.160 --> 02:51.425
I DON'T KNOW.
JUST THESE?

02:54.500 --> 02:55.990
SOMEBODY'S GOTTA
HELP YOU FIELD

02:56.000 --> 02:57.900
ALL THESE COLLEGE
RECRUITERS

02:57.910 --> 03:00.470
AND HELP YOU MAKE
THE RIGHT CHOICE.

03:00.480 --> 03:02.107
AND WE BOTH
KNOW THAT

03:02.110 --> 03:03.942
I'M THE BRAINS
IN THE FAMILY, SO...

03:05.080 --> 03:07.469
WAIT. SINCE WHEN
DID MOM

03:07.480 --> 03:09.346
WANT TO PLAY
COLLEGE FOOTBALL?

03:27.940 --> 03:29.931
OH. GRANDPA.

03:29.940 --> 03:31.101
ARE YOUR PARENTS HOME?

03:31.110 --> 03:32.669
MY DAD'S ALREADY
AT THE FIELD

03:32.670 --> 03:34.934
SETTING UP THE COMBINE
AND MOM'S GOT A CONFERENCE.

03:34.940 --> 03:36.578
GOOD. GOOD.

03:39.010 --> 03:41.980
UH...WHAT--WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE?

03:41.980 --> 03:43.982
YOU STOPPED
COMING BY TO SEE ME.

03:43.990 --> 03:45.685
FIGURED I'D
COME SEE WHY.

03:45.690 --> 03:47.112
WELL, YOU KNOW,
I'VE JUST BEEN BUSY

03:47.120 --> 03:49.088
TRAINING FOR THE PLAYOFFS
AND THE COMBINE.

03:49.090 --> 03:50.626
YOU CALL

03:50.630 --> 03:52.689
WHAT YOUR DADDY
DOES TRAINING?

03:54.000 --> 03:55.024
THOUGHT YOU WANTED
MY HELP.

03:55.030 --> 03:56.998
I THOUGHT ABOUT IT,
AND I'M GOOD,

03:57.000 --> 03:58.070
AT LEAST
ON THE TRAINING.

03:58.070 --> 03:59.060
BUT I'M STILL
DOWN TO HANG OUT,

03:59.070 --> 04:00.333
AS LONG AS YOU DON'T
TRY TO USE ME

04:00.340 --> 04:01.967
AS AN ATM AGAIN.

04:01.970 --> 04:05.031
HMM. HEH!
YOU KNOW WHAT?

04:05.040 --> 04:06.508
HOW ABOUT BREAKFAST
ON ME? HMM?

04:06.510 --> 04:09.002
I CAN'T TODAY. I GOTTA
GET TO THE COMBINE.

04:09.010 --> 04:11.069
WHAT FOR? YOU AIN'T
READY NO HOW.

04:11.080 --> 04:12.445
UM, I MEAN,
I WAS GOOD ENOUGH

04:12.450 --> 04:14.043
FOR THE COLLEGE RECRUITERS
TO INVITE ME.

04:14.050 --> 04:15.973
YOU SHOULD NEVER
BE SATISFIED

04:15.980 --> 04:17.947
WITH BEING
GOOD ENOUGH.

04:17.950 --> 04:19.440
AND JUST
FOR THE RECORD,

04:19.450 --> 04:22.385
YOU GOT INVITED 'CAUSE
YOU'RE BILLY BAKER'S BOY.

04:26.330 --> 04:29.391
WELL, NOT EVERYTHING
IS ABOUT MY DAD.

04:29.400 --> 04:31.596
WILLIE: LET ME
ASK YOU SOMETHING.

04:31.600 --> 04:33.489
WHEN WAS
THE LAST TIME YOU WERE

04:33.500 --> 04:35.366
REALLY CHALLENGED
ON THE FIELD?

04:35.370 --> 04:36.599
YOU, PERSONALLY?

04:36.610 --> 04:38.362
YOU'RE ABOUT TO GO UP
AGAINST COMPETITION

04:38.370 --> 04:40.680
THAT'S A WHOLE LOT
MORE TALENTED

04:40.680 --> 04:42.978
AND PREPARED
THAN YOU ARE.

04:42.980 --> 04:44.948
YOU'LL SEE.

04:46.280 --> 04:49.272
OR...MAYBE YOU'LL SEE

04:49.280 --> 04:51.442
WHENEVER I PROVE
YOU WRONG.

04:59.160 --> 05:00.150
OLIVIA: WHEN
YOU SAID WE WERE

05:00.160 --> 05:01.559
CO-HOSTING
THE COMBINE,

05:01.560 --> 05:03.369
I DIDN'T THINK YOU
LITERALLY MEANT "WE."

05:03.370 --> 05:05.725
HA HA! LOOK,
I APPRECIATE

05:05.730 --> 05:06.868
YOU GIVING US
A HAND.

05:06.870 --> 05:08.190
IT'S A BIG DAY.

05:08.200 --> 05:10.202
SPENCER,
YOUR BROTHER.

05:10.210 --> 05:12.861
ASHER. BUT I THOUGHT
HE WAS OFF THE TEAM.

05:12.870 --> 05:14.269
OH, HE IS.
HE IS.

05:14.280 --> 05:17.306
SCOUTS CONTROL THE
INVITATIONS, NOT ME.

05:17.310 --> 05:19.677
HE DIDN'T RSVP.
DID YOU FOLLOW UP?

05:19.680 --> 05:21.876
I MEAN, THIS IS A BIG DEAL
FOR HIM. HE NEEDS THIS.

05:21.880 --> 05:23.075
IF HE WANTED
TO BE HERE,

05:23.080 --> 05:25.310
HE WOULD'VE RSVP'd
LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE.

05:25.320 --> 05:27.152
ALL RIGHT?

05:47.940 --> 05:49.237
HEY. AHEM.,

05:49.240 --> 05:50.969
HEY.

05:50.980 --> 05:53.449
OLIVIA. WHAT ARE
YOU, UH...

05:53.450 --> 05:54.918
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

05:54.920 --> 05:56.513
I THINK
THE QUESTION IS

05:56.520 --> 05:59.012
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

05:59.020 --> 06:00.954
HAVE YOU BEEN SLEEPING
IN YOUR CAR?

06:03.330 --> 06:04.889
YEAH.

06:04.890 --> 06:06.483
I GOT INTO IT WITH MY DAD,

06:06.490 --> 06:08.026
AND HE PUT ME OUT.

06:09.060 --> 06:10.562
THINGS DIDN'T GO OVER
WELL WITH MY MOM

06:10.570 --> 06:12.493
IN MALIBU,
EITHER, SO...

06:13.870 --> 06:15.861
I'M SORRY, ASHER.

06:15.870 --> 06:17.167
OK, BUT YOUR PLAN
CAN'T BE

06:17.170 --> 06:18.865
TO DRINK YOUR
PROBLEMS AWAY

06:18.870 --> 06:20.031
AND SLEEP
IN YOUR CAR.

06:20.040 --> 06:22.236
DON'T TELL ANYONE
ABOUT THE CAR THING.

06:22.240 --> 06:25.039
MY LIFE IS ALREADY
PATHETIC ENOUGH AS IS.

06:25.050 --> 06:27.269
OK. ON TWO
CONDITIONS.

06:28.920 --> 06:34.017
ONE--PUT THIS ON.

06:34.020 --> 06:34.987
IT'S YOUR
COMBINE JERSEY.

06:34.990 --> 06:36.219
THE COMBINE?
THAT'S TODAY?

06:36.220 --> 06:39.349
YES, ASHER,
IT'S TODAY.

06:39.360 --> 06:41.351
YOU'RE ALREADY OFF
THE FOOTBALL TEAM.

06:41.360 --> 06:43.397
I MEAN, THIS MIGHT
BE YOUR LAST CHANCE

06:43.400 --> 06:44.993
AT A SCHOLARSHIP.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.263
DO YOU EVEN CARE
ABOUT YOUR FUTURE?

06:46.270 --> 06:47.897
OF COURSE.

06:47.900 --> 06:49.368
LOOK, I JUST ASSUMED WITH
ME BEING OFF THE TEAM,

06:49.370 --> 06:50.360
I'D BE UNINVITED.

06:50.370 --> 06:52.907
WELL, YOU'RE NOT.

06:52.910 --> 06:55.333
WHAT'S THE SECOND
CONDITION?

06:56.610 --> 07:01.616
YOU TAKE A SHOWER,
LIKE...NOW.

07:01.620 --> 07:04.112
IT'S, LIKE,
REALLY BAD, DUDE.

07:04.120 --> 07:06.009
SPENCER: WHEN WERE YOU GONNA
TELL ME ABOUT NIGHT SCHOOL?

07:06.020 --> 07:07.181
I WAS HERE ALL SUMMER

07:07.190 --> 07:08.658
AND DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
YOU SIGNED UP.

07:08.660 --> 07:10.082
OH, BABY,
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

07:10.090 --> 07:11.160
I WAS TRYING TO
FINISH MY B.A., BUT--

07:11.160 --> 07:12.355
YEAH, AND YOU DROPPED OUT.

07:12.360 --> 07:14.089
WAS IT BECAUSE
I MOVED TO BEVERLY?

07:14.100 --> 07:16.023
COLLEGE ISN'T THAT
FAR AWAY FOR YOU.

07:16.030 --> 07:17.020
IT WAS PAST TIME
I STARTED SAVING

07:17.030 --> 07:18.691
FOR YOUR COLLEGE FUND--

07:18.700 --> 07:20.134
YOURS AND DILLON'S.

07:20.140 --> 07:21.460
THAT'S WHAT
MY EXTRA MONEY

07:21.470 --> 07:22.995
SHOULD'VE BEEN GOING TO.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.502
I'M ALREADY SO CLOSE

07:24.510 --> 07:25.966
TO GETTING
A SCHOLARSHIP,

07:25.970 --> 07:26.971
SO CLOSE TO DOING
WHAT I SAID I WOULD

07:26.980 --> 07:27.970
WHEN I MOVED
TO BEVERLY.

07:27.980 --> 07:28.970
YOU SEEN
THE LETTERS?

07:28.980 --> 07:30.300
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO WORRY ABOUT

07:30.310 --> 07:31.505
SAVING FOR MY TUITION
NO MORE, ALL RIGHT?

07:31.510 --> 07:33.239
YOU CAN GO TO SCHOOL.

07:33.250 --> 07:35.218
I DON'T WANT YOU BETTING
EVERYTHING ON FOOTBALL.

07:35.220 --> 07:37.040
YOU'RE TOO GIFTED
FOR THAT.

07:37.050 --> 07:39.212
WHAT IF YOU GET INJURED
AND FOOTBALL GOES AWAY?

07:39.220 --> 07:40.710
SO DOES
YOUR SCHOLARSHIPS.

07:40.720 --> 07:42.210
LOOK, MOM...

07:42.220 --> 07:44.154
YOUR JOB IS MAKING
SOMETHING SPECIAL

07:44.160 --> 07:46.959
OUT OF EVERYTHING THAT
I COULD GIVE YOU,

07:46.960 --> 07:49.429
LIKE YOU ALWAYS DO. OK?

07:56.570 --> 07:58.368
BOY: ALL RIGHT? THERE YOU GO.
DIFFERENT BOY: THANK YOU.

07:58.370 --> 08:00.099
WHAT'S UP, BABY?
WHAT YOU DOING HERE?

08:00.110 --> 08:01.669
STUCK COVERING FOR OLIVIA,

08:01.680 --> 08:04.149
WHICH SHE OWES ME FOR
BIG-TIME.

08:05.610 --> 08:07.112
HEY, EVERYTHING OK?

08:07.120 --> 08:08.417
YEAH, JUST A LOT
ON MY MIND.

08:08.420 --> 08:09.717
YOU KNOW.

08:09.720 --> 08:11.518
BIG DAY.

08:11.520 --> 08:15.150
UM, HEY, CAN YOU
COVER FOR ME A SEC?

08:18.760 --> 08:20.194
WHAT'S GOING ON?

08:20.200 --> 08:21.998
I THOUGHT YOU WEREN'T
WORRIED ABOUT THE COMBINE.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.297
I WASN'T.

08:23.300 --> 08:24.563
NOW I GOTTA LAND
A SCHOLARSHIP

08:24.570 --> 08:26.299
THIS WEEKEND
AND COMMIT.

08:26.300 --> 08:28.166
WHAT HAPPENED TO KEEPING
YOUR OPTIONS OPEN?

08:28.170 --> 08:30.104

17:32.250 --> 17:33.740
IT'S ALL GOOD,

17:33.750 --> 17:35.013
I'M USED TO HUSTLING

17:35.020 --> 17:36.317

17:36.320 --> 17:39.517
AND, MAN, WE BOTH KNOW

18:02.180 --> 18:03.602
LET'S HOPE
IT WAS ENOUGH.

18:03.610 --> 18:05.499
WHY, NO
7-ON-7 INVITE?

18:05.510 --> 18:06.602
NOT YET.

18:09.080 --> 18:11.811
<i>332 LOOKS LIKE CAM
JUST GOT HIS.</i>

18:11.820 --> 18:13.481
THE KID'S A BEAST.

18:20.360 --> 18:22.590
COMBINE'S BEEN OVER
FOR A WHILE.

18:24.100 --> 18:26.068
I'M NOT READY
TO LEAVE JUST YET.

18:32.070 --> 18:34.539
I MISS THIS...

18:34.540 --> 18:36.372
BEING OUT HERE.

18:36.380 --> 18:38.269
I DIDN'T
APPRECIATE IT ENOUGH.

18:38.280 --> 18:40.647
WELL, COME BACK TOMORROW
FOR THE 7-ON-7 GAME.

18:40.650 --> 18:42.243
I'll BE HERE.

18:45.120 --> 18:47.088
SO WILL 1.

18:47.090 --> 18:49.411
WAIT. IS THAT--

18:49.420 --> 18:51.081
THEY INVITED ME
TO PLAY.

18:51.090 --> 18:53.149
ASHER,
THAT'S AMAZING.

18:53.160 --> 18:54.025
I MEAN, THE GOLD
ENVELOPE'S A BIT MUCH.

18:54.030 --> 18:57.227
KIND OF WILLY WONKA,
IF YOU ASK ME, BUT--

18:58.370 --> 18:59.428
WELL, IF ANYONE
NEEDED A GOLDEN TICKET

18:59.430 --> 19:01.398
RIGHT ABOUT NOW,
IT WAS ME.

19:01.400 --> 19:04.062
THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN
WITHOUT YOU. THANK YOU.

19:06.310 --> 19:07.709
OLIVIA: SO PROUD OF YOU.

19:14.150 --> 19:15.447
SPENCER JAMES.

19:15.450 --> 19:17.885
MAN, WHAT'D
I TELL YOU?

19:17.890 --> 19:19.847
THAT KID HAS A CHANCE
TO BE SPECIAL.

19:19.850 --> 19:21.215
HE ALREADY IS.

19:21.220 --> 19:23.211
OH, YEAH,
THANKS TO YOU.

19:23.220 --> 19:25.382
NO. KID MAKES
ME LOOK GOOD.

19:25.390 --> 19:26.858
HEH. NOW,
WE BOTH KNOW

19:26.860 --> 19:30.228
IT'S NOT EASY TO DEVELOP
RAW TALENT LIKE THAT, MAN.

19:30.230 --> 19:31.891
MY HEAD COACH
IS IMPRESSED.

19:31.900 --> 19:33.163
FOR REAL? COACH MACK?

19:33.170 --> 19:34.535
HE SHOULD BE.

19:34.540 --> 19:37.168
SPENCER IS A
ONCE-IN-A-GENERATION TALENT.

19:37.170 --> 19:38.501
I'M TALKING
ABOUT YOU, BILLY.

19:38.510 --> 19:40.137
BILLY: SAY WHAT?
DAMON: MM-HMM.

19:40.140 --> 19:41.210
COACH MACK
WANTS TO KNOW IF

19:41.210 --> 19:42.609
YOU ARE INTERESTED
IN COACHING AT

19:42.610 --> 19:44.203
THE NEXT LEVEL.

19:44.210 --> 19:46.349
I'M TALKING ANGELES
SOUTHERN, MAN.

19:46.350 --> 19:48.273
BILLY, THINK
ABOUT IT, MAN.

19:48.280 --> 19:50.214
WE WOULD GET
TO WORK TOGETHER,

19:50.220 --> 19:53.713
AND YOU COULD CONTINUE
TO DEVELOP SPENCER.

19:53.720 --> 19:55.279
THERE IT IS.

19:55.290 --> 19:56.815
DAMON: WHAT?
BILLY: THE PACKAGE DEAL.

19:56.820 --> 19:59.460
NO. NO, NO, NO. THAT'S
NOT WHAT THIS IS, MAN.

19:59.460 --> 20:00.154
NO?

20:00.160 --> 20:01.628
YOU ARE AN ELITE
COACH, BILLY,

20:01.630 --> 20:05.225
AND WE BOTH KNOW
THAT, RIGHT? HUH?

20:05.230 --> 20:07.369
SO. YOU INTERESTED?

20:07.370 --> 20:11.739
UH...YES. I AM.
HA HA!

20:12.840 --> 20:14.205
MY MAN.

20:14.210 --> 20:16.304
MM. LISTEN.

20:16.310 --> 20:17.641
I WILL SET SOMETHING UP
WITH YOU AND MACK.

20:17.650 --> 20:19.277
MAN, THIS IS GONNA
BE FUN, BRUH.

20:19.280 --> 20:20.304
ALL RIGHT.

20:20.310 --> 20:24.247
OH, AND,
JUST SO I KNOW,

20:24.250 --> 20:25.684
ANY IDEA WHICH WAY
THE KID IS LEANING?

20:27.190 --> 20:28.680
MAKE HIM AN OFFER.

20:45.270 --> 20:46.908
HEY, SPENCER.

20:46.910 --> 20:48.969
YOU ON YOUR WAY HOME?

20:48.980 --> 20:51.301
SPENCER: YEAH.
BRETT: GOOD. GOOD.

20:51.310 --> 20:53.608
GO HOME.
GET DRESSED UP.

20:53.610 --> 20:55.317
SEE YOU TONIGHT.

20:57.350 --> 20:58.090
THANK YOU.

20:58.090 --> 20:59.216
I WANTED TO DELIVER
THAT MYSELF

20:59.220 --> 21:00.779
INSTEAD OF
COACH KING.

21:00.790 --> 21:03.487
YOU KNOW, WE GOT LIMITED
SPACE AT ANGELES SOUTHERN.

21:03.490 --> 21:05.322
YES, SIR.

21:05.330 --> 21:06.582
WE'RE GONNA
MAKE ROOM FOR YOU.

21:06.590 --> 21:07.250
FOR REAL?

21:07.260 --> 21:08.659
WELL, IT'S NOT
OFFICIAL UNTIL

21:08.660 --> 21:11.300
YOU GET YOUR
OFFER LETTER, BUT, UH,

21:11.300 --> 21:13.166
IT'S ON ITS WAY.

21:14.670 --> 21:18.538
YOU SHOULD KNOW, UM, WE
TAKE CARE OF OUR OWN, SO,

21:18.540 --> 21:21.601
IF THERE'S ANYTHING
YOU NEED, ANYTHING,

21:21.610 --> 21:23.305
YOU COME TO ME.

21:23.310 --> 21:24.573
YES, SIR.

21:26.950 --> 21:28.714
WELCOME TO ASU, SON.

21:31.520 --> 21:33.511
SO, CHRIS JUST
LEFT WITHOUT

21:33.520 --> 21:34.988
SAYING GOOD-BYE TO YOU?

21:34.990 --> 21:37.960
HE'S PROBABLY JUST UPSET
ABOUT THE COMBINE AND--

21:37.960 --> 21:41.328
I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE HE
JUST NEEDS SOME SPACE.

21:41.330 --> 21:45.426
HMM. LOOK AT YOU
BEING ALL UNDERSTANDING.

21:45.430 --> 21:46.898
HE'S MY BOYFRIEND.

21:46.900 --> 21:48.561
GLAD YOU
REMEMBERED THAT.

21:48.570 --> 21:50.390
WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

21:50.400 --> 21:52.368
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOUR
EMERGENCY THIS MORNING

21:52.370 --> 21:53.508
WAS SAVING ASHER.

21:53.510 --> 21:55.330
HE'S IN A BAD PLACE
RIGHT NOW.

21:55.340 --> 21:57.741
I MEAN, I'VE BEEN THERE,
AND I WAS LUCKY.

21:57.750 --> 22:00.469
I MEAN, WHAT SAVED
ME WAS A FAMILY

22:00.480 --> 22:02.915
WHO FORCED ME TO GET
THE HELP THAT I NEEDED.

22:04.350 --> 22:06.819
WE JUST NEED TO BE
THAT FAMILY FOR ASHER.

22:11.030 --> 22:12.429
HEY, BABY.

22:12.430 --> 22:13.750
HEY.

22:13.760 --> 22:15.296
I GOT BIG NEWS.

22:15.300 --> 22:16.290
I HEARD.

22:16.300 --> 22:17.665
YOU DID?

22:17.670 --> 22:19.866
YOU GOT AN INVITE TO
THAT 7-ON-7 SCRIMMAGE.

22:19.870 --> 22:21.429
BILLY TEXTED ME.

22:21.440 --> 22:23.397
THAT'S NOT
THE BIG NEWS, MA.

22:23.400 --> 22:25.630
YOU MIGHT WANT
TO SIT DOWN FOR THIS.

22:25.640 --> 22:27.506
I'll STAND.

22:28.810 --> 22:31.347
I'M GOING TO ANGELES
SOUTHERN UNIVERSITY.

22:31.350 --> 22:32.806
THEY ABOUT TO OFFER ME
A FULL RIDE.

22:32.810 --> 22:35.040
THAT WAY I CAN STAY CLOSE
TO HOME, AND WE CAN JUST--

22:35.050 --> 22:36.745
ANGELES SOUTHERN?

22:36.750 --> 22:39.082
NO. YOU'RE NOT MAKING
THIS DECISION NOW.

22:39.090 --> 22:40.910
IT'S A GOOD SCHOOL, MA.
WE DID IT.

22:40.920 --> 22:42.558
NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

22:42.560 --> 22:44.324
NOT FOR YOU.
NOT ACADEMICALLY.

22:44.330 --> 22:45.627
YOU WORKED
TOO HARD FOR THIS.

22:45.630 --> 22:47.052
YEAH, YOU RIGHT. I DID
WORK HARD FOR THIS.

22:47.060 --> 22:48.391
THAT'S WHY IT'S
MY DECISION.

22:48.400 --> 22:49.219
LET ME STOP YOU
RIGHT NOW.

22:49.230 --> 22:51.369
YOU BEST BELIEVE
THIS IS OUR DECISION.

22:51.370 --> 22:52.690
MA, THIS FULL
SCHOLARSHIP MEANS

22:52.700 --> 22:54.338
YOU CAN FINISH YOUR
DEGREE RIGHT NOW.

22:54.340 --> 22:55.899
I DID NOT
SEND YOU TO BEVERLY

22:55.900 --> 22:58.506
AND QUIT NIGHT SCHOOL SO YOU
COULD SELL YOUR FUTURE SHORT.

22:58.510 --> 22:59.534
I MADE THOSE
SACRIFICES...

22:59.540 --> 23:01.804
YOU THINK I LIKE LIVING IN
SOMEBODY ELSE'S HOUSE?

23:01.810 --> 23:04.541
HELPING MY LITTLE BROTHER WITH
HIS HOMEWORK OVER THE PHONE?

23:04.550 --> 23:06.405
YOU NOT THE ONLY ONE MAKING
SACRIFICES HERE, ALL RIGHT?

23:06.410 --> 23:08.048
I'M GONNA NEED YOU
TO TAKE THAT BASS

23:08.050 --> 23:09.677
OUT YOUR VOICE
RIGHT NOW.

23:11.690 --> 23:13.419
I'M SORRY.

23:13.420 --> 23:16.117
BUT IT IS
MY DECISION.

23:16.120 --> 23:19.784
AND I DECIDED THAT ASU
IS THE RIGHT PLACE FOR ME.

23:19.790 --> 23:23.499
THAT'S IT.
I'M DOING THIS FOR YOU,

23:23.500 --> 23:24.990
FOR DILLON, AND ME.

23:27.030 --> 23:28.589
THAT'S IT.

24:17.990 --> 24:19.583
GOOD EVENING.

24:19.590 --> 24:21.115
UH, CAN I TALK TO
YOU FOR A SECOND?

24:21.120 --> 24:23.009
YEAH. GIVE ME
A MINUTE, GUYS.

24:24.120 --> 24:25.121
EVERYTHING OK?

24:25.130 --> 24:26.620
YEAH. ALL GOOD.

24:26.630 --> 24:28.598
I JUST WANTED TO THANK
YOU FOR THE INVITATION.

24:28.600 --> 24:29.590
LISTEN--

24:29.600 --> 24:30.499
HEY, HEY.

24:30.500 --> 24:33.561
WHATEVER'S IN THAT
ENVELOPE BELONGS TO YOU.

24:33.570 --> 24:34.492
KEEP IT.

24:34.500 --> 24:36.662
I'M SURE THAT'D BE
A BIG HELP TO YOUR MOTHER.

24:36.670 --> 24:39.105
IT'S NOT EASY BEING THE
ONLY PARENT IN THE HOUSE.

24:39.110 --> 24:40.839
CAM: BRETT HANSON.
MY DAWG.

24:40.840 --> 24:42.035
CAM, I THOUGHT
I MISSED YOU.

24:42.040 --> 24:43.201
HA! NAH, MAN.

24:43.210 --> 24:44.575
JUST HAD TO MAKE
A QUICK STOP.

24:44.580 --> 24:46.469
YOU KNOW, CINDERELLA
DON'T COME TO THE BALL

24:46.480 --> 24:50.940
TILL SHE GETS HER
GLASS SLIPPERS.

24:50.950 --> 24:53.920
BRETT: YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE A LOT OF FUN TONIGHT.

24:53.920 --> 24:55.888
YOU BOTH DESERVE
A LITTLE SOMETHING SPECIAL

24:55.890 --> 24:57.415
AFTER TODAY.

24:59.830 --> 25:01.559
SO, WHAT,
YOU TAKING MONEY NOW?

25:01.560 --> 25:02.391
DIDN'T YOU?

25:02.400 --> 25:03.856
I THOUGHT YOU WANTED
ANGELES SOUTHERN.

25:03.860 --> 25:05.669
NO, I WANT THE SCHOLARSHIP,
NOT THE MONEY.

25:05.670 --> 25:08.537
OK. WHATEVER.
DO YOU.

25:08.540 --> 25:10.133
LOOK,
ONE PHONE CALL,

25:10.140 --> 25:11.630
AND YOU LOSE
YOUR ELIGIBILITY.

25:11.640 --> 25:13.460
THAT'S HIGH SCHOOL,
COLLEGE.

25:13.470 --> 25:14.505
ASU ALREADY GOT
WHAT THEY NEED

25:14.510 --> 25:16.103
TO KEEP YOU, DAWG.

25:16.110 --> 25:17.578
THAT MONEY
AIN'T A GIFT.

25:17.580 --> 25:18.979
IT'S LEVERAGE
SO YOU GOTTA COMMIT.

25:18.980 --> 25:21.176
I AIN'T STUPID.
I KNOW WHAT THIS IS,

25:21.180 --> 25:22.477
AND I'M GOOD
WITH IT.

25:22.480 --> 25:24.016
SO, WHEN THEY GIVE ME
THAT SCHOLARSHIP,

25:24.020 --> 25:24.987
I'M GONNA TAKE IT.

25:24.990 --> 25:28.153
SO, YOU'RE COOL WITH
BEING BOUGHT AND PAID FOR?

25:28.160 --> 25:30.049
I AIN'T GOT
NO FAIRY GODFATHER

25:30.060 --> 25:31.528
IN BEVERLY HILLS.

25:31.530 --> 25:32.986
I JUST GOT FOOTBALL.

25:32.990 --> 25:35.220
SO, I'M GONNA USE IT
FOR WHAT I CAN GET

25:35.230 --> 25:36.994
AS LONG AS I CAN.

25:37.000 --> 25:38.422
THAT'S THE GAME.

25:39.570 --> 25:41.664
NOW, IF YOU'LL
EXCUSE ME,

25:41.670 --> 25:43.138
I'M GOING TO GO
GET ME ONE OF THEM

25:43.140 --> 25:44.801
TINY-ASS PLATES.

25:50.640 --> 25:52.677
OLIVIA: DAD,
YOU HAVE A VISITOR.

25:54.880 --> 25:56.518
ALL RIGHT, LET'S
MAKE THIS QUICK, SON.

25:56.520 --> 25:58.841
I'M ALREADY LATE
FOR THE SHOWCASE DINNER.

26:00.790 --> 26:02.019
YES, SIR.

26:04.890 --> 26:06.483
I, UM...

26:10.130 --> 26:11.564
I WANTED
TO THANK YOU.

26:11.570 --> 26:13.197
I KNOW THAT I LET YOU
DOWN AT HOMECOMING.

26:13.200 --> 26:15.089
I JUST--I REALLY
APPRECIATE YOU

26:15.100 --> 26:16.659
GIVING ME
THIS CHANCE.

26:16.670 --> 26:18.638
OK, WELL,
YOU'RE WELCOME.

26:18.640 --> 26:21.678
JUNIOR COLLEGE COACH EVEN
EXPRESSED INTEREST TODAY.

26:21.680 --> 26:23.569
THINKS I CAN GO ON
TO A D-I SCHOOL.

26:23.580 --> 26:24.604
ALL RIGHT.

26:24.610 --> 26:26.601
SINCE HE
DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING,

26:26.610 --> 26:27.816
I'M GUESSING YOU
DIDN'T TELL THE COACHES

26:27.820 --> 26:29.049
THAT I WAS KICKED
OFF THE TEAM.

26:29.050 --> 26:30.870
THEY DIDN'T ASK.

26:30.880 --> 26:32.848
BUT, UH,
UNDERSTAND THIS.

26:32.850 --> 26:35.785
IF SOMEONE DOES
ASK ME DIRECTLY,

26:35.790 --> 26:37.610
I AIN'T LYING
FOR YOU.

26:40.130 --> 26:41.655
ONE MORE THING.

26:41.660 --> 26:44.721
OLIVIA HAS FOUGHT
REALLY HARD

26:44.730 --> 26:47.597
TO GET HER LIFE
BACK TOGETHER.

26:47.600 --> 26:48.761
AND NOW SHE
SEEMS DETERMINED

26:48.770 --> 26:51.330
TO HELP YOU
DO THE SAME.

26:51.340 --> 26:54.207
DO NOT DRAG HER
BACK DOWN WITH YOU.

26:54.210 --> 26:55.837
DO NOT.

26:55.840 --> 26:59.071
SHE SEES SOMETHING
IN YOU, ASH.

26:59.080 --> 27:00.946
PLEASE PROVE HER RIGHT.

27:04.350 --> 27:05.249
I APPRECIATE YOU
GUYS ON THAT.

27:05.250 --> 27:06.888
THANKS. I APPRECIATE
THAT. GOOD TO SEE YOU.

27:06.890 --> 27:08.585
-GREAT WORK TODAY.
-YOU, TOO.

27:08.590 --> 27:09.751
SEE YOU. YEAH.

27:12.960 --> 27:14.086
HEY, COACH.

27:14.090 --> 27:16.593
MM. TO A GREAT COMBINE.

27:16.600 --> 27:18.090
OR MAYBE WE CAN TOAST

27:18.100 --> 27:21.161
THE NEXT GREAT ASU
QUARTERBACK, JORDAN BAKER.

27:26.740 --> 27:28.071
WHAT DID YOU
WANT ME TO SAY?

27:28.080 --> 27:31.675
OK, LOOK,
YOU DID FINE TODAY, OK?

27:31.680 --> 27:33.671
YOU HAVE ALL THE NECESSARY
TOOLS, MAN.

27:33.680 --> 27:35.273
YOU GOT A STRONG ARM.
YOU'RE A SMART KID.

27:35.280 --> 27:36.372
OK, BUT?

27:36.380 --> 27:38.712
SOMETHING'S HOLDING
YOU BACK.

27:38.720 --> 27:40.119
I MEAN, GREAT PLAYERS,
THEY JUST PLAY,

27:40.120 --> 27:44.660
BUT YOU, YOU HESITATE
UNDER PRESSURE.

27:44.660 --> 27:46.628
AND YOU GOTTA FIGURE OUT
WHY FOR YOURSELF.

27:51.700 --> 27:52.792
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

27:52.800 --> 27:53.926
I'M--I'M SORRY.
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

27:53.930 --> 27:55.295
I JUST ASKED IF
COACH BAKER'S PLANNING

27:55.300 --> 27:58.235
TO USE YOU ANY
DIFFERENTLY IN THE PLAYOFFS.

27:58.240 --> 28:03.337
YEAH. I, UH...MAYBE.

28:03.340 --> 28:04.671
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN
GAME PLANNING?

28:04.680 --> 28:06.648
NO, WE--WE HAVE.

28:06.650 --> 28:08.641
NO, COACH AND I...

28:10.780 --> 28:11.918
ACTUALLY, I WAS HOPING

28:11.920 --> 28:13.945
TO TRANSFER TO MALIBU
NEXT YEAR.

28:13.950 --> 28:14.951
IS THIS ABOUT
BAKER BRINGING IN

28:14.960 --> 28:17.019
THE KID
FROM CRENSHAW?

28:17.020 --> 28:18.727
NO. IT'S NOT.

28:20.290 --> 28:21.758
IT'S BECAUSE
I GOT MYSELF

28:21.760 --> 28:23.125
KICKED OFF THE TEAM.

28:27.100 --> 28:29.831
BILLY: WE HEAR
CONGRATULATIONS ARE IN ORDER.

28:29.840 --> 28:31.035
I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT ALL THAT.

28:31.040 --> 28:32.132
WHAT? DID YOU CHANGE
YOUR MIND ABOUT

28:32.140 --> 28:34.199
COMMITTING TO
ANGELES SOUTHERN?

28:35.910 --> 28:39.210
I FOUND TWO Gs
IN MY INVITATION ENVELOPE.

28:39.210 --> 28:40.769
WHAT'D YOU DO WITH IT?

28:41.750 --> 28:43.741
TRIED TO GIVE IT
BACK TO HANSON.

28:43.750 --> 28:45.240
HE WOULDN'T TAKE IT.

28:45.250 --> 28:47.958
A BOOSTER?
ARE YOU SURE?

28:47.960 --> 28:49.917
HE DIDN'T BOTHER WITH
SEEMING SURPRISED.

28:49.920 --> 28:52.355
LOOK, I CAN'T LOSE
THIS SCHOLARSHIP.

28:53.960 --> 28:55.121
ALL RIGHT.

28:55.130 --> 28:57.758
CLEAN PROGRAMS, THEY
DON'T WANT BOOSTERS

28:57.760 --> 28:59.728
PUTTING THEIR
PLAYERS' ELIGIBILITY

28:59.730 --> 29:01.767
AT RISK, SO...

29:01.770 --> 29:03.238
I'll HANDLE THIS.

29:04.870 --> 29:05.837
GAY.

29:06.940 --> 29:07.862
HEY.

29:07.870 --> 29:09.304
WHAT'S GOING ON,
BROTHER?

29:09.310 --> 29:11.802
THERE'S SOMETHING
I THINK YOU SHOULD SEE.

29:14.210 --> 29:15.871
LET'S TALK
ABOUT IT.

29:15.880 --> 29:17.848
WAIT. SO, YOU KNOW
ABOUT THE MONEY.

29:17.850 --> 29:19.887
THERE'S BEEN
A MISUNDERSTANDING.

29:19.890 --> 29:21.710
HANSON GAVE A POTENTIAL
RECRUIT MONEY.

29:21.720 --> 29:22.858
IT'S THAT SIMPLE.

29:22.860 --> 29:24.009
BAKER, THIS IS
ONLY A BIG DEAL

29:24.020 --> 29:25.454
IF YOU TURN IT
INTO ONE.

29:25.460 --> 29:26.359
PAYOFFS.
BOOSTER GIFTS.

29:26.360 --> 29:28.419
THAT'S HOW THE
RECRUITING GAME IS PLAYED.

29:28.430 --> 29:31.889
YOU ARE PUTTING THESE
KIDS' FUTURES AT STAKE,

29:31.900 --> 29:34.096
THEIR FAMILIES' FUTURES.

29:35.840 --> 29:37.865
THE ONLY FUTURES
AT RISK HERE

29:37.870 --> 29:40.009
ARE YOURS
AND SPENCER'S.

29:40.010 --> 29:41.774
WHISTLEBLOWERS
GET COACHES FIRED,

29:41.780 --> 29:43.771
AND A KID LIKE THAT
CAN'T BE CONTROLLED,

29:43.780 --> 29:45.305
AND THAT KIND OF TROUBLE
ISN'T WORTH

29:45.310 --> 29:46.846
THE RISK TO US.

29:46.850 --> 29:48.318
SO, IF THE JAMES KID
REALLY WANTS

29:48.320 --> 29:49.879
TO JOIN OUR PROGRAM,

29:49.880 --> 29:51.814
YOU GET THAT BOY
TO PLAY BALL.

29:51.820 --> 29:53.811
WELL, IF YOU THINK
THAT I'M GONNA LET YOU

29:53.820 --> 29:55.788
COMPROMISE SPENCER

29:55.790 --> 29:58.054
OR ANY OF MY BOYS,

29:58.060 --> 29:59.255
YOU GOT ANOTHER
THINK COMING.

29:59.260 --> 30:00.250
HMM.

30:03.460 --> 30:04.859
MAN, BOY.

30:04.870 --> 30:06.759
THEN I GUESS
THE JAMES KID

30:06.770 --> 30:08.397
ISN'T ANGELES
SOUTHERN MATERIAL.

30:10.900 --> 30:12.937
AND NEITHER ARE YOU.

30:21.880 --> 30:23.109
SPENCER: COACH KING
CAN DO THAT?

30:23.120 --> 30:25.043
JUST NOT LET ME PLAY
AFTER I EARNED IT?

30:25.050 --> 30:26.745
I'M NOT
THE COACH HERE.

30:26.750 --> 30:28.081
SO, WHAT, I'M JUST
SUPPOSED TO STAND THERE?

30:28.090 --> 30:29.558
WHAT DO I DO IF
ANOTHER RECRUITER ASKS?

30:29.560 --> 30:31.483
YOU'RE GONNA SAY
YOU'RE INJURED

30:31.490 --> 30:32.560
AND THAT YOU CAN'T PLAY.

30:32.560 --> 30:34.085
COME ON, MAN.
AIN'T NO WAY.

30:34.090 --> 30:36.525
YEAH. I'M SORRY,
SPENCER,

30:36.530 --> 30:38.692
BUT YOU DID
REALLY WELL YESTERDAY,

30:38.700 --> 30:41.533
AND THE SCOUTS
WILL REMEMBER THAT.

30:41.540 --> 30:43.599
BUT IF YOU END UP
SUITING UP,

30:43.600 --> 30:45.637
THEN PEOPLE ARE
GONNA ASK QUESTIONS,

30:45.640 --> 30:47.859
AND EVEN THOUGH
YOU DID NOTHING WRONG,

30:47.870 --> 30:49.679
THOSE QUESTIONS ARE GONNA
END UP BEING MARKS AGAINST YOU.

30:49.680 --> 30:51.546
HOW IS THIS FAIR?

30:51.550 --> 30:52.904
IT'S NOT, SON.

30:54.250 --> 30:55.843
IT'S NOT FAIR.

30:57.720 --> 31:00.018
OLIVIA: LOOK, I KNOW IT
SUCKS NOT MAKING THE CUT,

31:00.020 --> 31:02.660
BUT, I MEAN, YOU JUST
DISAPPEARED ON ME.

31:02.660 --> 31:05.527
WASN'T JUST
THE 7-ON-7.

31:05.530 --> 31:06.827
ARE YOU GONNA
TELL ME, THEN,

31:06.830 --> 31:10.050
BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T,
I'M GONNA THINK IT'S ME.

31:12.100 --> 31:13.795
OH, IT IS ME.

31:13.800 --> 31:15.894
IT'S JUST THIS WAS
A BIG WEEKEND FOR ME.

31:15.900 --> 31:16.731
YOU KNOW?

31:16.740 --> 31:19.607
AND YOU'RE WITH ASHER
THE WHOLE TIME.

31:19.610 --> 31:21.601
YOU KNOW THERE'S
NOTHING BETWEEN

31:21.610 --> 31:22.907
ME AND ASHER, RIGHT?

31:22.910 --> 31:24.605
OK, AH, I KNOW THAT,
ALL RIGHT?

31:24.610 --> 31:27.705
ALL I'M SAYING IS,
YESTERDAY WAS TOUGH,

31:27.710 --> 31:29.109
AND IT JUST SUCKS

31:29.120 --> 31:30.576
THAT I HAVE
TO DISAPPEAR

31:30.580 --> 31:32.309
FOR YOU TO SEE
ALL THAT.

31:32.320 --> 31:34.687
OK, YOU KNOW WHAT?
FORGET IT.

31:34.690 --> 31:35.612
I SHOULDN'T HAVE
EVEN SAID NOTHING.

31:35.620 --> 31:37.679
NO, NO, HEY,

31:37.690 --> 31:38.760
I'M GLAD
YOU DID,

31:38.760 --> 31:42.697
AND I'M...
I'M SORRY

31:42.700 --> 31:44.122
I DIDN'T SEE HOW HARD
YESTERDAY WAS FOR YOU

31:44.130 --> 31:48.021
BECAUSE I'VE-- I'VE
NEVER SEEN YOU SHAKEN.

31:48.030 --> 31:53.036
NOT BY GUNSHOTS
OR SLUT-SHAMING.

31:56.340 --> 31:58.707
I'll LOOK HARDER
NEXT TIME,

31:58.710 --> 31:59.905
AND AS FOR ASHER--

31:59.910 --> 32:01.742
NAH, I KNOW Y'ALL
BEEN COOL FOR A MINUTE.

32:01.750 --> 32:03.309
YEAH, NO,
IT'S NOT THAT.

32:03.320 --> 32:06.620
LAST YEAR, I DIDN'T
ASK FOR HELP,

32:06.620 --> 32:08.952
AND IT ALMOST
COST ME MY LIFE.

32:08.960 --> 32:12.828
YOU MEAN WHEN-- WHEN
YOU WERE AN ADDICT?

32:12.830 --> 32:15.629
IT'S NOT
A PAST-TENSE THING.

32:15.630 --> 32:19.726
<i>UM.. 1 DIDN'T STOP
BEING AN ADDICT</i>

32:19.730 --> 32:22.597
WHEN I
STOPPED USING,

32:22.600 --> 32:26.036
AND A PART OF HOW
I DEAL WITH THAT IS

32:26.040 --> 32:28.202
BY HELPING OTHERS.

32:28.210 --> 32:29.700
LIKE ASHER.

32:29.710 --> 32:31.940
I GET IT IF
YOU DON'T WANT TO

32:31.950 --> 32:33.600
BE A PART OF THAT
OR IF I'M, LIKE,

32:33.610 --> 32:35.578
TOO COMPLICATED OR--

32:45.660 --> 32:46.821
I CAN'T LIKE YOU
FOR YOUR HEART

32:46.830 --> 32:48.320
AND BE MAD
WHEN YOU USE IT.

32:55.040 --> 32:55.632
SORRY.

32:55.640 --> 32:57.096
YOU'RE GOOD.
YOU'RE GOOD.

32:59.940 --> 33:01.704
OLIVIA: HEH.
CHRIS: HEY.

33:01.710 --> 33:03.303
DO YOUR THING.

33:03.310 --> 33:05.677
ALL RIGHT.
IT'S ALL GOOD.

33:12.020 --> 33:14.387
MA? WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

33:14.390 --> 33:15.653
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

33:15.660 --> 33:16.786
ASU COACH WON'T
LET ME PLAY.

33:16.790 --> 33:18.758
BILLY ALREADY
TOLD ME.

33:18.760 --> 33:19.579
DOESN'T EXPLAIN
WHY YOU LEAVING.

33:19.590 --> 33:20.887
LOOK, IF THE SCOUTS
THINK I'M INJURED,

33:20.890 --> 33:22.392
THEY WON'T THINK
I'M TROUBLE.

33:22.400 --> 33:24.994
SINCE WHEN DO YOU CARE
WHAT OTHER PEOPLE THINK?

33:25.000 --> 33:27.867
YOU'VE GIVEN UP
SO MUCH FOR ME.

33:27.870 --> 33:30.032
I WANTED THE SCHOLARSHIP
FOR YOU.

33:30.040 --> 33:31.701
THE SAME WAY YOU WANT
WHAT'S BEST FOR ME,

33:31.710 --> 33:33.200
I WANT WHAT'S BEST
FOR YOU, TOO.

33:34.810 --> 33:36.403
MA, YOUR DREAMS
ARE IMPORTANT, TOO.

33:36.410 --> 33:38.674
YES, OUR DREAMS
ARE IMPORTANT,

33:38.680 --> 33:40.705
BUT NOT AT THE EXPENSE
OF WHO WE ARE.

33:40.710 --> 33:42.348
YOU DID THE RIGHT THING
NOT COMPROMISING

33:42.350 --> 33:43.772
YOURSELF FOR
A SCHOLARSHIP,

33:43.780 --> 33:45.987
BUT I'll BE DAMNED
IF I LET YOU BACK DOWN.

33:48.720 --> 33:51.212
DON'T PLAY THAT GAME.

33:51.220 --> 33:53.120
PLAY YOURS.

33:55.300 --> 33:58.930
ASHER? YOU IN HERE?

33:58.930 --> 34:00.091
ASHER: YOUR DAD WOULD
KILL YOU IF HE KNEW

34:00.100 --> 34:01.864
YOU WERE IN
THE LOCKER ROOM.

34:04.370 --> 34:06.304
WELL, I WANTED
TO CHECK IN.

34:06.310 --> 34:08.699
I'M SORRY THEY CUT
YOU FROM THE SHOWCASE.

34:08.710 --> 34:11.077
I KNEW HONESTY
HAD ITS CONSEQUENCES.

34:11.080 --> 34:14.710
NEVER REALLY BELIEVED YOU
ABOUT THE REWARDS, THOUGH.

34:14.710 --> 34:18.943
REWARDS?
WHAT HAPPENED?

34:18.949 --> 34:21.248
I'M BACK ON THE TEAM.

34:21.250 --> 34:23.309
WHAT? WHAT?

34:23.320 --> 34:26.324
WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL ME?

34:26.330 --> 34:28.059
IT JUST HAPPENED.

34:29.760 --> 34:32.092
YOUR DAD SAID THAT ME
TELLING THAT COACH THE TRUTH,

34:32.100 --> 34:34.228
IT SHOWED HIM THAT
I WAS FINALLY WILLING

34:34.230 --> 34:36.790
TO OWN MY CRAP.

34:36.800 --> 34:39.303
YOU KNOW,
TAKE ACCOUNTABILITY.

34:39.310 --> 34:40.902
OLIVIA, THANK YOU.

34:40.909 --> 34:42.378
NO, I DIDN'T
DO ANYTHING.

34:42.380 --> 34:44.735
YEAH. YOU DID.

34:44.739 --> 34:47.050
OK, WELL, I'M NOT
DONE YET.

34:47.050 --> 34:49.746
ASHER, YOU CAN'T KEEP
SLEEPING IN YOUR CAR

34:49.750 --> 34:53.812
FOR A GAZILLION
REASONS, BUT...

34:53.820 --> 34:55.857
I THINK I HAVE
A SOLUTION.

35:06.330 --> 35:07.400
YO, COACH'S SON KEEPS

35:07.400 --> 35:08.993
OVERTHROWING ME, MAN.

35:09.000 --> 35:10.889
I TOLD Y'ALL HE AIN'T
NO REAL QB.

35:10.900 --> 35:12.299
BILLY: YOU GONNA LET HIM
TALK TO YOU LIKE THAT?

35:12.310 --> 35:13.539
YEAH, HE'S RIGHT, OK?

35:13.540 --> 35:14.803
WHAT YOU MEAN,
HE'S RIGHT?

35:14.810 --> 35:15.902
HE AIN'T RIGHT.

35:15.910 --> 35:16.980
EASY. IT WASN'T
PERFECT, BUT--

35:16.980 --> 35:18.505
TH--THERE'S NO "BUT" AFTER

35:18.510 --> 35:20.899
"IT WASN'T PERFECT," OK?

35:20.910 --> 35:22.776
HOLD UP. WHAT'S
THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

35:22.780 --> 35:23.815
IT MEANS STOP
PATRONIZING ME

35:23.820 --> 35:26.949
AND START PUSHING ME
TO BE THE BEST.

35:26.950 --> 35:28.782
OK, GRANDPA WILLIE
WAS RIGHT. I'M--

35:28.790 --> 35:30.155
I'M NOT READY
FOR ALL THIS.

35:30.160 --> 35:31.855
I WARNED YOU ABOUT
LETTING THAT MAN

35:31.860 --> 35:33.089
GET INSIDE
YOUR HEAD, BOY.

35:33.090 --> 35:34.922
DAD, WOULD I HAVE EVEN
MADE THE SHOWCASE

35:34.930 --> 35:36.819
IF I WASN'T YOUR SON?

35:36.830 --> 35:39.925
LOOK, EVEN IF THAT
DID PLAY A ROLE,

35:39.930 --> 35:41.898
AND THAT'S A BIG "IF,"

35:41.900 --> 35:43.834
WHAT MATTERS
IS WHAT YOU DO

35:43.840 --> 35:44.830
WITH THE OPPORTUNITY.

35:44.840 --> 35:46.069
SPENCER: HEY. HEY.

35:46.070 --> 35:47.208
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

35:47.210 --> 35:48.405
GET IN THERE
AND OWN YOUR SPOT, MAN.

35:48.410 --> 35:49.400
KEEP FIRING.

35:49.410 --> 35:51.799
IT AIN'T ON YOU IF CAM
WON'T GO UP AND GET IT.

35:51.810 --> 35:52.971
THOUGHT YOU WERE
INJURED OR WHATEVER.

35:52.980 --> 35:53.799
LOOK, SCOUTS CAN
THINK WHAT THEY WANT.

35:53.810 --> 35:55.278
IF COACH KING WON'T
GIVE ME A CHANCE,

35:55.280 --> 35:57.840
THEN THAT'S ON HIM,
BUT I'MMA BE RIGHT HERE.

35:57.850 --> 35:58.920
AND WHEN I DO GET
MY SHOT, AIN'T NOBODY

35:58.920 --> 36:00.342
FORGETTING ABOUT ME.

36:01.820 --> 36:04.380
YOU KNOW WHAT?
TO HELL WITH THIS.

36:04.390 --> 36:05.824
BOTH Y'ALL GET WARM.

36:05.830 --> 36:06.979
YOU'RE GONNA GET
ANOTHER SHOT AT

36:06.990 --> 36:10.153
THAT NEXT SERIES. GO. GO.

36:10.160 --> 36:11.889
LET'S DO IT.

36:11.900 --> 36:13.322
ALL RIGHT.

36:14.830 --> 36:16.229
WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON?

36:16.240 --> 36:17.867
JORDAN AND SPENCER
ARE GONNA PLAY

36:17.870 --> 36:18.803
IN THIS NEXT SERIES.

36:18.810 --> 36:21.108
AND IF NOT, I'M GOING
STRAIGHT TO THE NCAA.

36:21.110 --> 36:22.874
I'M GONNA START
WHISPERS ABOUT

36:22.880 --> 36:25.076
THERE BEING
A DIRTY COACH AT ASU.

36:25.080 --> 36:26.900
I'M WONDERING HOW MUCH
LONGER THAT PROGRAM'S

36:26.910 --> 36:28.912
GONNA PROTECT YOU
ONCE I START

36:28.920 --> 36:30.149
GIVING INTERVIEWS
TO ESPN ABOUT

36:30.150 --> 36:32.244
HOW YOU'RE
MAKING PAYOFFS.

36:33.590 --> 36:35.615
YOU WON'T EVER
COACH AGAIN.

36:35.620 --> 36:36.883
EXCUSE ME.

36:45.970 --> 36:49.838
BOY: FIGHT THE D.
WIDE, HUT!

37:15.930 --> 37:17.193
BILLY: WHOO.

37:17.200 --> 37:18.190
JORDAN: MONEY.
BILLY: OK.

37:20.000 --> 37:21.161
HA!

37:21.170 --> 37:23.264
THAT'S A DAMN FINE
PLAY, YO.

37:23.270 --> 37:24.499
NO, DAD,
THAT'S ALL SPENCE.

37:24.500 --> 37:25.570
YO, THOSE VIEWS
FOR REAL?

37:25.570 --> 37:27.265
YEAH, MAN.
250,000 AND CLIMBING.

37:27.270 --> 37:28.601
BILLY: WHAT? DID YOU POST THAT?

37:28.610 --> 37:30.237
UH-UH. GOT POSTED TO
SOME RECRUITMENT SITE.

37:30.240 --> 37:32.277
WE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
ABOUT IT TILL JJ HIT US UP.

37:32.280 --> 37:32.974
YEAH.

37:32.980 --> 37:34.072
AH. EXPLAINS
WHY I GOT A CALL

37:34.080 --> 37:37.618
FIRST THING THIS MORNING FROM
THE S.E.C. SCOUT ASKING ABOUT YOU.

37:37.620 --> 37:38.746
SPENCER: FOR REAL?
BILLY: UH-HUH.

37:38.750 --> 37:39.512
'CAUSE OF THE VIDEQ?

37:39.520 --> 37:41.909
NO. WHEN ONE BIG DOG
STARTS SNIFFING AROUND,

37:41.920 --> 37:43.581
YOU CAN EXPECT THE REST
CLOSE BEHIND.

37:43.590 --> 37:45.058
WELL DONE, Y'ALL. YEAH.

37:45.060 --> 37:46.585
WHOA!
APPRECIATE YOU.

37:46.590 --> 37:47.660
WAY TO GET IT DONE.
WANT TO SEE IT AGAIN?

37:47.660 --> 37:48.593
YEAH.

37:51.230 --> 37:53.198
WAIT A MINUTE. YOU
WANT ME TO DO WHAT?

37:53.200 --> 37:55.237
OLIVIA: ASHER'S
HOMELESS, AND YOU HAVE

37:55.240 --> 37:57.698
A BIG, EMPTY HOUSE
JUST SITTING HERE.

37:57.700 --> 37:59.134
IT MAKES SENSE.

37:59.140 --> 38:00.437
YOU SERIOUS
RIGHT NOW?

38:00.440 --> 38:02.101
THERE'S GOTTA BE
SOMEWHERE ELSE HE CAN STAY

38:02.110 --> 38:03.339
OTHER THAN MY HOUSE.

38:03.340 --> 38:04.876
HIS DAD
KICKED HIM OUT.

38:04.880 --> 38:07.201
HE'S LIVING
IN HIS CAR.

38:07.210 --> 38:08.769
HE HAS NO ONE
AND, LOOK, YES,

38:08.780 --> 38:10.748
HE'S MADE
SOME MISTAKES, OK?

38:10.750 --> 38:12.514
ALL FOUR OF US HAVE.

38:12.520 --> 38:14.147
BUT SOMEHOW,
HE'S THE ONLY ONE

38:14.150 --> 38:15.618
STILL PAYING FOR IT.

38:18.630 --> 38:23.124
IT'S YOUR HOUSE,
AND I TRUST YOU.

38:29.600 --> 38:32.467
YEAH. THAT'S IT?

38:35.280 --> 38:36.372
IF YOU WANT ME TO
TELL YOU I WAS WRONG

38:36.380 --> 38:38.235
ABOUT YOU
BEING READY...

38:38.240 --> 38:39.446
I WANT YOU TO TELL ME
WHAT YOU SEE.

38:39.450 --> 38:41.305
THAT'S NOT A THROW,
JORDAN.

38:41.310 --> 38:44.143
IT'S A CATCH,
SPENCER'S CATCH.

38:44.150 --> 38:45.345
I KNOW IT,
AND ANY SCOUT

38:45.350 --> 38:47.387
WORTH HIS SALT
WILL KNOW IT, TOO.

38:51.320 --> 38:53.926
JORDAN: OK.
WILLIE: OK WHAT?

38:53.930 --> 38:55.056
OK, I WANT YOU TO TRAIN ME.

38:55.060 --> 38:55.800
WHY?

38:55.800 --> 38:58.451
IT TOOK ME A WHILE TO REALIZE
HOW MUCH THE GAME MEANT TO ME.

38:58.460 --> 38:59.928
OK? THAT I WANTED IT
FOR ME

38:59.930 --> 39:02.797
AND NOT MY DAD,
BUT NOW I KNOW.

39:02.800 --> 39:05.599
I WANT TO BE GREAT,
AND YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE

39:05.610 --> 39:06.759
WHO'S EVER HELD ME
TO THAT STANDARD.

39:06.770 --> 39:08.169
YOU NEED TO BE
SURE, KID.

39:08.170 --> 39:09.672
AIN'T GONNA BABY YOU.

39:09.680 --> 39:12.342
AIN'T GOT NO TIME
FOR NO WHINING.

39:12.350 --> 39:13.647
I DON'T COACH
LIKE YOUR DADDY.

39:13.650 --> 39:16.244
YOU'RE LIKELY TO HATE ME
BEFORE WE'RE DONE.

39:16.250 --> 39:17.615
UNDERSTAND?

39:17.620 --> 39:18.883
YES, SIR.

39:33.370 --> 39:34.724
YOU SURE ABOUT THIS?

39:36.540 --> 39:38.736
YOU KNOW WHERE
THE GUEST BEDROOM 1IS.

39:40.370 --> 39:43.408
WOMAN: WHEN I FIRST
LAID EYES ON YOU

39:43.410 --> 39:46.300
AND I HEARD YOUR
HEARTBEAT, TOO

39:46.310 --> 39:48.950
WELL, I NEVER KNEW
I COULD WITNESS

39:48.950 --> 39:52.284
AN ANGEL SO BEAUTIFUL

39:52.290 --> 39:55.749
FROM THE VERY MOMENT
YOU ARRIVED

39:55.760 --> 39:58.354
I FELT SOMETHING
NEW INSIDE...

39:58.360 --> 40:00.351
SO, WHAT'S
THE SPECIAL OCCASION?

40:00.360 --> 40:02.454
CHICKEN POT PIE'S
A DEAD GIVEAWAY.

40:03.560 --> 40:05.289
WOW. DIDN'T
EVEN REALIZE

40:05.300 --> 40:07.598
I DID THAT. HEH!

40:10.400 --> 40:12.835
YES.

40:12.840 --> 40:15.275
I WANTED TO DO SOMETHING
SPECIAL FOR YOU TWO.

40:15.280 --> 40:16.839
WHAT FOR?

40:16.840 --> 40:19.002
WELL, SPENCER
HELPED ME

40:19.010 --> 40:21.377
REALIZE SOMETHING
YESTERDAY.

40:21.380 --> 40:23.610
NOT ONLY AM I
YOUR MOTHER,

40:23.620 --> 40:26.317
I'M ALSO A MEMBER
OF THIS FAMILY.

40:26.320 --> 40:27.310
AND IN THIS FAMILY,

40:27.320 --> 40:28.651
WE DON'T LET EACH
OTHER SETTLE

40:28.660 --> 40:31.413
FOR ANYTHING LESS
THAN WHAT WE DESERVE.

40:31.420 --> 40:33.650
AND IF I'M GONNA
ASK THAT OF YOU,

40:33.660 --> 40:37.358
I HAVE TO ASK THAT
OF MYSELF, TOO.

40:37.360 --> 40:39.499
SO, TODAY...

40:42.740 --> 40:44.936
I PICKED UP THIS
FINANCIAL AID PACKAGE

40:44.940 --> 40:46.362
FROM THE COLLEGE.

40:46.370 --> 40:49.874
TO BE HONEST,
IT'S NOT ENOUGH.

40:49.880 --> 40:51.507
I'M GONNA NEED
YOUR HELP.

40:51.510 --> 40:53.547
BUT IF WE AGREE
THAT THIS IS

40:53.550 --> 40:56.941
WHAT'S BEST FOR ALL
OF US, FOR THIS FAMILY,

40:56.950 --> 40:58.475
I PROMISE TO TRY
TO DO

40:58.480 --> 41:00.380
WHAT YOU TWO
DO EVERY DAY--

41:00.390 --> 41:02.085
MAKE SOMETHING SPECIAL
OF EVERY OPPORTUNITY

41:02.090 --> 41:03.683
THAT YOU GIVE ME.

41:05.760 --> 41:07.319
WE'RE IN.

41:10.700 --> 41:15.934
ADULT EDUCATION
GRANT APPLICATION.

41:15.940 --> 41:17.465
BUT THAT AIN'T NOTHING.

41:17.470 --> 41:18.631
I GOT A HOOKUP WITH

41:18.640 --> 41:20.529
MRS. G's
AFTER-SCHOOL PROGRAM.

41:20.540 --> 41:22.634
IF I HELP OUT WITH
THE LITTLE KIDS THERE,

41:22.640 --> 41:25.109
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
PICK ME UP TILL 7:45.

41:25.110 --> 41:26.475
TOTALLY FREE.

41:26.480 --> 41:27.948
HEY, DON'T LOOK AT ME.

41:27.950 --> 41:29.440
THAT WAS ALL D.

41:29.450 --> 41:31.373
DILLON, YOU NEVER HAD A MS. G.

41:31.380 --> 41:32.688
HOW DO YOU
KNOW HER?

41:32.690 --> 41:34.442
WELL, SPENCER
ISN'T THE ONLY

41:34.450 --> 41:35.952
JAMES BROTHER
WHO GOT GAME.

41:35.960 --> 41:37.382
SPENCER: SHUT UP!
GRACE: YOU KNOW WHAT?

41:37.390 --> 41:40.485
WOMAN: HOLD ON TO MY HAND

41:40.490 --> 41:42.891
AND NEVER LET ME GO

41:42.900 --> 41:45.426
TO MAMA'S HAND

41:45.430 --> 41:49.560
AND NEVER LET IT GO

41:49.570 --> 41:53.632
HOLD ON TO MY HAND,
OH OOH OH OH-OH

42:18.100 --> 42:19.590
MAN: GREG, MOVE YOUR HEAD.
