My name is Tobias Whale.

What're you doing in my room?

40:47.638 --> 40:49.670
I wanted to see how you were doing.

I understand what you're going through.

40:55.435 --> 40:58.634
Black Lightning messed my life up, too.

40:58.637 --> 41:00.632
I wanted you to have some nice things

you go through the same thing.

Well, I've followed your
athletic career a long time,

41:25.440 --> 41:27.540
and it hurt me to see you hurt.

41:28.409 --> 41:30.209
But what I've learned about pain is,

41:30.211 --> 41:32.111
pain makes you stronger.

41:32.113 --> 41:34.473
Pain makes you tougher.

41:34.476 --> 41:38.511
And eventually, you get to a
point where you don't even feel it.

41:38.514 --> 41:43.528
If you'd like, I can show
you how to kill your pain.
