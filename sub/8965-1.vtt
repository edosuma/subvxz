00:37.583 --> 00:41.792
TELL NO ONE

00:43.875 --> 00:45.667
You guys free next weekend?

00:47.750 --> 00:49.542
I told you we'd wake her.

00:51.375 --> 00:52.750
Let me hold her!

00:55.500 --> 00:57.208
You want a cuddle with Alex?

01:00.375 --> 01:01.625
Give her the pacifier.

01:01.833 --> 01:03.583
Non-peacefully, even?

01:11.458 --> 01:13.750
The country, what a drag...

01:15.833 --> 01:17.625
I think he's ready!

01:17.833 --> 01:21.333
After 9 years of med school,
a kid's the last thing he needs!

01:22.292 --> 01:23.542
Why not?

01:32.000 --> 01:33.333
They annoying you?

01:34.292 --> 01:37.000
You feed her exhaust fumes
all day long!

01:37.792 --> 01:40.208
No worries, I know what she likes.

01:43.500 --> 01:45.333
Wrap the blanket round her.

02:56.042 --> 02:57.875
<i>Lake Charmaine</i>

03:12.500 --> 03:13.833
François! François!

03:14.417 --> 03:15.708
Daddy! Daddy!

03:33.667 --> 03:34.750
Let's go.

04:21.166 --> 04:22.250
Stop that!

04:28.833 --> 04:29.583
Looks good.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.292
- Did you call your sister back?
- No.

05:28.250 --> 05:30.750
Why are you being like this with her?

05:30.958 --> 05:32.000
Like what?

05:33.500 --> 05:34.417
I don't know.

05:37.167 --> 05:39.417
Last night, you totally ignored her.

05:42.542 --> 05:45.875
- Because she won't sell the farm?
- It's crazy!

05:46.083 --> 05:49.875
It costs us a fortune.
She doesn't even want to live there.

05:50.083 --> 05:52.917
You think your dad
would've wanted to sell?

05:53.125 --> 05:55.833
That's irrelevant.
She's a rider not a manager.

05:56.042 --> 05:58.625
Who'll run the stables?
I don't have time.

05:58.833 --> 06:00.667
- Don't get mad.
- I'm not.

06:00.875 --> 06:02.792
You always take her side.

06:05.875 --> 06:07.458
You're right. I'll butt out.

06:07.667 --> 06:11.167
Margot, it's not that.
Look, I'm sorry.

06:11.375 --> 06:12.750
I'll let the dog out.

06:13.375 --> 06:14.750
I'm sorry!

06:50.583 --> 06:51.583
Margot?

07:13.042 --> 07:14.375
Alex!

07:44.875 --> 07:49.958
<i>Eight years later</i>

08:33.750 --> 08:34.750
Okay...

08:36.082 --> 08:39.707
I think I've seen enough
to contradict your family doctor.

08:40.042 --> 08:43.542
We'll take her off cortisone.
It won't cure her eczema.

08:43.750 --> 08:45.250
What will help her...

08:46.000 --> 08:50.125
is if you let your child
enjoy her life.

08:50.333 --> 08:51.500
Get off me!

08:52.875 --> 08:57.542
You know what I would suggest
when she doesn't have school?

08:58.792 --> 09:00.083
Cartoons in bed,

09:01.333 --> 09:04.458
fries for lunch.
Friends to visit

09:04.667 --> 09:08.125
all afternoon, and Barbie,
chocolate and the whole shebang!

09:08.333 --> 09:09.667
Call him, I said!

09:10.417 --> 09:13.042
And lots of TV, of course.
Excuse me.

09:13.250 --> 09:14.500
Let go of me!

09:15.958 --> 09:18.000
Let go of me or I'll pop you!

09:20.750 --> 09:22.333
- Call him!
- Calm down...

09:22.542 --> 09:24.375
Get lost!
Who the hell are you?

09:24.583 --> 09:25.625
Get lost, I said!

09:29.042 --> 09:30.792
- Calm down.
- He hit me!

09:31.000 --> 09:32.542
Bruno, what's wrong?

09:32.750 --> 09:34.500
He fell off the couch!

09:34.708 --> 09:36.167
I told them to call you!

09:36.375 --> 09:37.917
I called ER first!

09:38.458 --> 09:41.542
- He's your patient?
- For 3 years. Hemophiliac.

09:41.750 --> 09:44.667
Bruno, give them your son.

09:44.875 --> 09:47.417
- No, why isn't it you?
- It's not my unit.

09:47.625 --> 09:48.833
Fuck that! I want you.

09:49.833 --> 09:51.250
Nobody touches my boy!

09:51.625 --> 09:53.542
Nobody touches my boy!

09:54.125 --> 09:55.750
Okay, Bruno.

09:56.417 --> 09:59.042
Your son probably
has internal bleeding.

09:59.417 --> 10:02.500
Give him to me.
I'll take him in if you want.

10:15.208 --> 10:15.958
Stand back!

10:26.458 --> 10:27.792
What you staring at?

10:55.167 --> 10:58.583
<i>Two bodies unearthed</i>
in Rambouillet forest

11:03.875 --> 11:05.250
Shit, that's good!

11:06.208 --> 11:09.208
Julie, show Mr. Rossignon to table 9.

11:13.208 --> 11:15.000
- I love lunch with you.
- Sorry.

11:15.708 --> 11:19.167
Summer's usually quiet
but we're overrun by tourists.

11:20.708 --> 11:24.250
I'll have the sole
and turn the air-con up, it's sweltering.

11:27.833 --> 11:29.333
You got plans tomorrow?

11:30.375 --> 11:32.542
I promised Margot's mom I'd stop by.

11:35.875 --> 11:37.708
Alex, don't you think it's...

11:40.000 --> 11:41.167
It's been 8 years!

11:42.417 --> 11:44.208
I'm not saying turn the page,

11:44.417 --> 11:48.583
but I don't see why you always
celebrate this morbid anniversary.

11:48.792 --> 11:49.542
Celebrate?

11:49.750 --> 11:51.417
Whatever...

11:51.625 --> 11:55.250
You've nothing to say to them.
You see them once a year

11:55.458 --> 11:57.333
to commemorate her death.

11:58.958 --> 12:00.333
I'm sorry...

12:00.708 --> 12:04.500
It's just I thought
we'd spend the evening together.

12:10.625 --> 12:11.917
I'll come by after.

12:13.542 --> 12:17.125
If you shut me out,
you'll shut everyone out.

12:20.625 --> 12:22.708
Talk to me, okay?

12:35.750 --> 12:36.875
How you doing?

12:37.583 --> 12:39.708
Going nuts,
sitting doing nothing.

12:40.417 --> 12:41.542
I can imagine.

12:42.333 --> 12:44.708
Unfortunately, it's the only option.

12:45.083 --> 12:47.792
They'll call you
when the operation's over.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.167
Now, you're here,
I'll take a walk.

12:51.792 --> 12:53.000
Call me if there's news.

12:54.583 --> 12:55.625
Sure.

12:59.333 --> 13:00.042
Thanks.

13:02.083 --> 13:03.958
What? Take it back.

13:04.167 --> 13:05.875
You'd prefer a DVD player?

13:06.417 --> 13:08.042
Plasma TV? A sweet plasma?

13:08.250 --> 13:11.000
I don't want anything.
Take it back.

13:11.417 --> 13:12.667
I'll call you.

13:48.958 --> 13:51.625

14:13.667 --> 14:14.750
A problem?

14:16.875 --> 14:19.125
Not at all. Show her in.

14:20.000 --> 14:23.167
Rambouillet police called.
Sergeant Lavelle.

14:23.375 --> 14:24.750
He said it was urgent.

14:49.625 --> 14:51.375
What are you staring at?

14:51.875 --> 14:53.667
I love watching you ride.

14:56.375 --> 14:59.083
- Come more often then.
- Yeah, I should.

15:06.083 --> 15:07.292
I'll be right there.

15:12.458 --> 15:13.583
Excuse me.

15:15.125 --> 15:17.208
Can you tell me when you went

15:17.417 --> 15:19.333
to Lake Charmaine last?

15:20.625 --> 15:22.583
I was down there last year.

15:25.417 --> 15:26.167
Doctor?

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
8 years ago.

15:30.292 --> 15:33.083
Like I told your brother on the phone,

15:33.875 --> 15:37.458
workmen laying pipes
dug up 2 bodies near the lake.

15:37.667 --> 15:39.667
She heard it on the radio.

15:39.917 --> 15:43.250
Yes, the press caught us
with our guard down.

15:45.333 --> 15:47.750
- You've identified them?
- No, we're running tests.

15:47.958 --> 15:50.333
All we have is
2 Caucasian males

15:51.083 --> 15:53.167
shot dead over 5 years ago.

15:53.375 --> 15:57.417
You said the bodies weren't on our land.
So why speak to us?

15:57.792 --> 16:00.958
I'm getting to that.
We may have to excavate farther,

16:01.500 --> 16:03.042
so I'd need permission to...

16:03.250 --> 16:04.375
You have it.

16:04.583 --> 16:06.208
- Anne?
- Of course.

16:06.417 --> 16:08.500
- You need a signature?
- Yes.

16:11.417 --> 16:13.333
Both your signatures.

16:20.708 --> 16:25.083
Sorry to drag this back up.
I know your wife's killer was tried...

16:25.542 --> 16:27.042
Cut the crap!

16:28.458 --> 16:29.750
You thought I killed her!

16:30.708 --> 16:34.125
You were her husband.
Family members are often...

16:34.333 --> 16:37.333
If not for that,
you might have found her alive!

16:37.917 --> 16:41.000
My colleagues
had to examine every possibility.

16:45.750 --> 16:46.500
Thank you.

16:59.125 --> 17:00.708
I'll need one last thing.

17:01.750 --> 17:02.500
What?

17:02.708 --> 17:05.166
A blood sample for a DNA test.

17:05.958 --> 17:08.750
When your wife was abducted,
you said they hit you...

17:09.041 --> 17:10.041
Yes.

17:10.375 --> 17:13.250
Well, we found a baseball bat
with the bodies,

17:14.250 --> 17:15.916
with traces of blood on it.

17:16.333 --> 17:18.791
B positive.
Just like you.

17:20.375 --> 17:22.125
You are type B positive?

17:23.791 --> 17:26.833
Of course, they could be victims
of Frank Serton,

17:28.208 --> 17:31.125
except serial killers
rarely change their M.O.

17:32.208 --> 17:34.667
Neither body shows signs of torture.

17:35.708 --> 17:39.083
They'd been buried.
There were no animal corpses.

17:39.875 --> 17:41.917
And Serton's victims were all women.

17:42.125 --> 17:43.167
So?

17:43.708 --> 17:47.125
So, it's all a bit fuzzy, Doctor.

17:51.042 --> 17:53.292
Let's talk again when it's not.

17:55.125 --> 17:58.917
That's precisely
why I need your cooperation.

17:59.125 --> 18:03.125
I'll give the sample,
but I told you all I knew back then.

18:03.333 --> 18:07.167
Yes, I read your statement.
Your wife screams...

18:07.708 --> 18:11.208
You get hit, fall in the water.
Wake up in the hospital.

18:13.792 --> 18:15.667
And the rest is still a blank.

18:18.500 --> 18:20.000
We bought that version.

18:20.208 --> 18:24.167
But if it is your blood,
the discovery of these 2 bodies

18:24.375 --> 18:26.542
means we'll reopen the investigation.

18:27.833 --> 18:29.542
I'll get it.

18:35.042 --> 18:39.000
We'll try to get some answers
to all those questions,

18:39.208 --> 18:43.375
like why were you found
unconscious on the dock?

18:44.083 --> 18:47.625
Who made the anonymous 911 call?
And above all...

18:49.417 --> 18:52.417
How did you get out of the water
when unconscious?

19:00.167 --> 19:03.500
Ms. Vigne is a nurse.
She'll take your blood sample.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.750
I thought you'd prefer...

19:06.875 --> 19:08.542
to do it right here.

22:52.542 --> 22:54.208
Céline, I'm not taking calls.

22:57.083 --> 22:58.292
<i>Yes, Doctor.</i>

24:11.875 --> 24:15.083

26:01.042 --> 26:02.708
Are you seeing anyone?

26:06.958 --> 26:09.042
I'm sorry, Alex.

26:10.417 --> 26:13.708
You don't have to tell me,
it's none of my business.

26:15.458 --> 26:16.833
There's no one.

26:18.417 --> 26:21.708
I mean, nothing serious.

26:24.750 --> 26:25.958
Alexandre...

26:29.250 --> 26:31.125
We all miss her so much.

26:31.458 --> 26:33.167
But you have a life to live.

26:33.375 --> 26:36.125
Don't feel guilty
about seeing other people.

26:36.333 --> 26:38.792
I don't.
I mean, it's not that.

26:41.917 --> 26:43.542
I'll check the lamb.

26:53.458 --> 26:54.667
How are you?

26:55.375 --> 26:56.917
Good. And you?

26:58.417 --> 26:59.542
Retirement!

27:00.125 --> 27:02.208
I wake up every morning
and make like...

27:04.833 --> 27:06.042
Drink?

27:12.000 --> 27:13.000
Jacques?

27:14.583 --> 27:16.833
I have an important question for you.

27:18.042 --> 27:19.375
I want to know...

27:19.708 --> 27:23.333
Margot...
What did she look like when you found her?

27:25.792 --> 27:26.875
What?

27:28.083 --> 27:31.208
I keep thinking about it.
Maybe it's the anniversary...

27:31.917 --> 27:33.333
I need to know.

27:37.542 --> 27:39.417
I never asked you for details.

27:40.042 --> 27:41.542
Was she beaten?

27:44.083 --> 27:45.458
Why are you doing this?

27:45.917 --> 27:47.542
I really need to know.

27:53.542 --> 27:55.208
There were bruises, yes.

27:58.167 --> 27:59.250
Where?

28:05.417 --> 28:06.833
On her face?

28:07.458 --> 28:07.917
Yes.

28:08.625 --> 28:11.125
- Her body, too?
- I didn't see her body.

28:13.000 --> 28:15.583
I was there as her dad not a cop,
to ID her.

28:16.625 --> 28:19.000
Did you identify her easily?

28:20.333 --> 28:21.583
Easily?

28:21.833 --> 28:23.750
You said her face was bruised.

28:23.958 --> 28:25.708
Screw you and your questions!

28:58.208 --> 29:00.958
If you could please identify the body?

29:18.542 --> 29:20.167
<i>Her left eye was swollen.</i>

29:22.417 --> 29:24.792
<i>Her nose was flattened and broken.</i>

29:25.292 --> 29:27.958
<i>Her face was slashed,</i>
probably with a box cutter.

29:29.667 --> 29:32.250
Her jaw was dislocated,
tendons ripped out...

29:37.333 --> 29:39.000
I'd like you to leave.

29:54.042 --> 29:55.250
Already?

29:55.958 --> 29:58.042
- They kick you out?
- Yeah.

30:01.583 --> 30:06.500
<i>European Championships 1996</i>

30:29.292 --> 30:33.542
To conclude this tribute,
I'd like you to applaud

30:33.792 --> 30:35.792
the President of the Children's Trust

30:36.000 --> 30:39.250
organizer of tonight's show
in memory of his son,

30:40.083 --> 30:42.125
he's going to lead the riders out.

30:42.333 --> 30:44.792
Please give a warm welcome
to state senator...

30:45.375 --> 30:46.875
Gilbert Neuville!

31:00.208 --> 31:02.125
Four short strides. It's tight.

31:11.417 --> 31:15.458
So at 8:15 tomorrow,
you get another message, right?

31:15.708 --> 31:16.708
Right.

31:22.958 --> 31:24.083
Where's that?

31:24.292 --> 31:26.583
Don't know.
Not in France, it's still light.

31:30.542 --> 31:33.667
How can you think it's her?
You can't see shit.

31:36.042 --> 31:37.750
Don't go there, Alex.

31:37.958 --> 31:39.833
It'll drive you insane.

31:42.292 --> 31:43.167
I know.

31:53.125 --> 31:54.417
How did it go?

31:54.625 --> 31:56.208
I placed second!

32:00.333 --> 32:03.792
- Bed for me. I'm wiped out.
- I was just leaving.

32:04.625 --> 32:06.000
You want some food, sweets?

32:12.042 --> 32:13.792
It's nothing. We had a fight.

32:16.917 --> 32:19.292
She thinks I'm banging
one of the waitresses.

32:58.875 --> 33:01.375
Lose that and get back to the emails.

33:06.625 --> 33:08.375
You knew the 2 guys at the lake?

33:08.583 --> 33:09.792
Show me the other.

33:17.750 --> 33:18.750
Same sender?

33:20.167 --> 33:21.792
Anonymous. Who knows?

33:22.000 --> 33:23.625
I do. It's the same person.

33:24.583 --> 33:26.083
You tried the passwords?

33:27.458 --> 33:29.000
The account doesn't exist.

33:29.625 --> 33:31.917
The sender will set it up at 8:15.

33:33.583 --> 33:35.792
I'm hooked up to both his computers.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.583
As soon as he's online, we'll know.

33:45.958 --> 33:47.750
I think I know enough already.

34:10.875 --> 34:12.000
Dr. Beck?

34:12.500 --> 34:15.833
Detective Meynard,
Versailles police.

34:17.000 --> 34:18.542
Can you follow me?

34:18.958 --> 34:20.458
What's going on?

34:21.125 --> 34:22.667
Excuse me a second.

34:24.625 --> 34:27.000
- Where'd you go?
- Wash my hands.

34:31.917 --> 34:34.208
Captain Eric Levkowich,
Versailles PD.

34:34.417 --> 34:36.250
What's all this about?

34:36.750 --> 34:39.750
It'll be easier to talk at the office.

35:09.458 --> 35:10.667
Mr. Beck...

35:10.875 --> 35:12.542
Who is Juliette Langlois?

35:16.292 --> 35:17.083
Will you stop that?

35:20.125 --> 35:23.500
Does the name Juliette Langlois
mean anything to you?

35:26.208 --> 35:28.125
Juliette is my wife's middle name.

35:31.500 --> 35:33.083
And your middle name?

35:33.500 --> 35:34.250
Arnaud.

35:36.000 --> 35:39.250
So let's imagine that I ask you
if the name...

35:39.792 --> 35:43.167
Arnaud Ripper
means something to you.

35:44.083 --> 35:46.958
You'd say,
"Actually, Arnaud's my middle name"?

35:49.125 --> 35:51.042
My wife grew up on Rue Langlois.

35:52.833 --> 35:55.458
That's why I said
it was her middle name.

35:57.917 --> 35:59.375
It reminded me of her.

36:00.750 --> 36:03.375
Did your wife ever use that name?

36:03.958 --> 36:04.958
In what way?

36:05.500 --> 36:08.250
"Hello, I'm Juliette Langlois,
I booked a room..."

36:08.583 --> 36:11.125
Or to get an ID with that name, see?

36:14.625 --> 36:17.583
No, it was a game we played
when we were kids.

36:31.750 --> 36:34.167
Did you ever beat up your wife?

36:38.875 --> 36:40.625
Let me repeat the question.

36:40.833 --> 36:43.583
Did you ever beat up your wife?

36:44.583 --> 36:47.167
What's wrong with you?

36:47.375 --> 36:49.625
Slapping your wife's no crime.

36:49.958 --> 36:51.375
Pretty natural even, huh?

36:51.583 --> 36:53.375
No, it's not natural!

36:54.125 --> 36:57.333
I never beat up my wife.
Are you listening to me?

37:34.958 --> 37:36.750
You think I did that?

37:42.917 --> 37:44.667
I promised your friend Hélène

37:44.875 --> 37:49.375
I'd help you, but I need you
to tell me all you can, clear?

37:52.125 --> 37:54.750
The car accident story...
Is it true?

37:55.167 --> 37:56.500
Of course, it's true.

37:57.000 --> 37:58.125
Were you with her?

37:58.333 --> 38:00.833
I was doing my internship in Bordeaux.

38:01.833 --> 38:04.875
- I'm warning you. They'll check.
- Let them.

38:07.792 --> 38:09.167
I know what I'm saying.

38:09.542 --> 38:13.000
Maybe she took the photos
for the insurance. Seems logical.

38:13.208 --> 38:15.167
No idea. I never saw them before.

38:18.417 --> 38:19.958
Are you forgetting anything?

38:23.500 --> 38:26.083
No.
What happens now?

38:27.292 --> 38:31.917
8 years on, it's a bit late
for a wife-beating charge. This stinks.

38:37.167 --> 38:38.542
Okay, go for it.

38:39.708 --> 38:40.917
Love it!

38:41.542 --> 38:43.583
Now, let's get a little wild.

38:43.792 --> 38:45.792
This is really good.

38:46.000 --> 38:49.083
Hold the duck in front of you,
like it's your thingy.

38:49.417 --> 38:52.042
Your tongue out
like you're gonna lick it.

38:52.250 --> 38:53.375
That's great!

38:54.250 --> 38:55.292
Fred!

39:00.375 --> 39:02.792
And again! More tongue!

39:03.708 --> 39:05.375
Love it!

39:12.000 --> 39:13.042
Hold on...

39:13.833 --> 39:15.333
I don't get it.

39:16.042 --> 39:18.167
You came to ask me that?

39:21.375 --> 39:23.417
That's all you have to say?

39:25.083 --> 39:26.375
I'm sorry.

39:26.583 --> 39:28.667
I don't give a shit about sorry!

39:28.875 --> 39:30.250
That's not the problem.

39:31.000 --> 39:32.458
I was grieving too, you know.

39:34.000 --> 39:35.792
I needed you there.

39:38.333 --> 39:40.917
You never called.
You never took my calls.

39:41.125 --> 39:42.333
I couldn't.

39:43.417 --> 39:47.042
I swear...
I couldn't face calling you.

39:47.833 --> 39:49.750
I thought I'd pull through alone.

39:52.333 --> 39:54.083
But I just went under.

39:59.292 --> 40:00.500
Tell me what happened.

40:01.417 --> 40:02.708
I don't know.

40:05.792 --> 40:07.292
Weren't you with her?

40:10.667 --> 40:14.000
One evening, she came by
covered in bruises all over.

40:14.750 --> 40:17.250
She said she'd had a car accident.

40:18.500 --> 40:23.083
If anybody asked, I was to say
we'd been together in my car.

40:23.458 --> 40:25.625
If anybody asked?

40:29.167 --> 40:30.542
I think she meant you.

40:32.500 --> 40:36.292
She wouldn't tell me anything else.
Nothing, honestly.

40:39.542 --> 40:41.542
- You took photos?
- Of?

40:41.750 --> 40:43.458
Her. Her injuries.

40:45.250 --> 40:46.667
Why would I do that?

40:50.792 --> 40:51.917
No reason.

40:58.125 --> 40:59.708
What's wrong?

41:02.083 --> 41:03.333
I've no idea.

41:09.250 --> 41:10.875
She was my best friend.

41:12.750 --> 41:14.458
Look at me, please.

41:15.333 --> 41:18.792
I swear she never lied to you.
It was the only time.

41:20.125 --> 41:21.292
You gotta believe me.

42:58.292 --> 42:59.792
<i>Ferrault & Gamblin...</i>

43:00.000 --> 43:02.417
May I to speak to Mr. Ferrault, please?

43:03.167 --> 43:05.667
<i>He's in court.</i>
Can I take a message?

43:24.750 --> 43:26.625
We found no trace of an accident...

43:27.792 --> 43:30.125
in either the insurance
or police records.

43:35.583 --> 43:37.542
Alex never hit Margot.

43:39.750 --> 43:40.750
He couldn't have.

43:43.292 --> 43:44.792
Can you leave us alone?

44:01.000 --> 44:02.292
Captain...

44:03.333 --> 44:06.750
If your son-in-law
decided to kill your daughter...

44:10.667 --> 44:13.125
He loved her, why'd he wanna do that?

44:13.708 --> 44:17.208
For 200,000 euros.
Her life insurance policy.

44:19.542 --> 44:20.875
That's absurd!

44:21.375 --> 44:25.583
With all the holes in the official story,
compare it to this...

44:26.250 --> 44:31.000
Beck drives her to an isolated locale
where there'll be no witnesses.

44:31.417 --> 44:32.458
There,

44:32.917 --> 44:36.792
the two guys we found last week
kidnap and kill her.

44:37.500 --> 44:40.292
Serton's on the loose.
It's in all the papers.

44:40.625 --> 44:44.458
They make it look like
she's one of Serton's victims.

44:44.875 --> 44:47.083
With dead cats and dogs all round.

44:47.833 --> 44:49.750
Easy as that. He takes the rap.

44:49.958 --> 44:53.042
Serton confessed to 7 murders,
not your daughter's.

44:54.708 --> 44:55.917
This is ridiculous.

44:56.125 --> 44:59.917
Alex was assaulted.
He was in a coma for 3 days.

45:00.125 --> 45:01.667
He had to get hurt.

45:02.167 --> 45:04.875
How'd he explain a couple scratches?

45:05.083 --> 45:08.208
He was on the shore.
How'd he get out of the water?

45:10.958 --> 45:14.167
All the doctors who saw his file
say it's impossible.

45:14.667 --> 45:17.500
Didn't that ever intrigue you?

45:23.375 --> 45:24.625
Who gave you those?

45:26.958 --> 45:29.792
In some way,
I'd say it was your daughter.

45:32.500 --> 45:34.917
We found a key
on one of the 2 corpses.

45:37.500 --> 45:39.667
To your daughter's safety-deposit box.

45:40.500 --> 45:42.417
Box 174.

45:43.250 --> 45:45.333
Registered to one
Juliette Langlois.

45:46.292 --> 45:48.250
Her middle name
and this street name.

45:48.458 --> 45:50.000
The photos were inside.

45:50.750 --> 45:52.917
Your son-in-law said he never saw them.

45:53.500 --> 45:55.458
Why would she hide them from him?

45:57.917 --> 45:59.667
You talked to Alex?

46:04.250 --> 46:06.208
- What else did he say?
- Nothing.

46:06.750 --> 46:08.375
He left with a lawyer.

46:08.583 --> 46:11.417
Not just any lawyer.
Elisabeth Feldman.

46:12.458 --> 46:14.500
That sound like an innocent man?

46:15.375 --> 46:17.208
Stop it now, that's enough.

46:17.583 --> 46:19.625
It's impossible.
It's the cops,

46:19.833 --> 46:21.958
trying to manipulate you.

46:22.667 --> 46:25.208
They can do anything with computers.

46:25.417 --> 46:26.792
She looked older.

46:27.000 --> 46:30.792
Age progression software.
They use it for missing kids.

46:31.000 --> 46:31.750
Mommy!

46:34.375 --> 46:37.792
If they think I killed her,
why send me emails

46:38.000 --> 46:39.542
as if she's still alive?

46:40.000 --> 46:41.250
Think about it.

46:41.917 --> 46:43.875
To get me to confess, it sucks.

46:44.792 --> 46:46.708
If I killed her,
I know it's a trap.

46:46.917 --> 46:49.083
- Alex, not now!
- It doesn't make sense.

46:49.292 --> 46:53.792
If they wanna trap me, send me
emails from a guy who saw me kill her.

46:55.167 --> 46:55.958
You see?

47:01.792 --> 47:05.208
If daddy says yes,
we'll go this weekend.

47:07.292 --> 47:08.792
C'mon, sweetheart,

47:09.333 --> 47:13.625
it's time to sleep now
and don't give her a hard time.

47:13.833 --> 47:15.458
Sleep well, princess.

47:51.667 --> 47:52.875
Where's Margot?

47:57.917 --> 47:59.583
I asked you a question.

48:10.708 --> 48:12.250
Nina!

48:13.000 --> 48:14.500
Go away! Basket!

48:23.875 --> 48:25.042
Cut it out!

48:30.792 --> 48:32.542
Fuck it!

48:33.833 --> 48:36.250
Hold on, let me try.

48:36.458 --> 48:38.333
I've been trying for half an hour!

48:40.500 --> 48:41.958
It doesn't work.

48:42.958 --> 48:44.167
Nothing works!

48:45.625 --> 48:46.792
Fucking thing!

48:47.000 --> 48:48.000
What's that up there?

48:50.208 --> 48:51.458
What is it?

48:53.917 --> 48:56.583
It means you're connected
to another computer.

49:00.208 --> 49:01.250
And?

49:01.833 --> 49:03.833
And I only have one computer here.

49:05.458 --> 49:07.708
Someone's connected to my computer.

49:08.917 --> 49:10.875
They're watching me.

49:13.083 --> 49:14.292
Fuck it!

49:19.958 --> 49:21.292
Okay...

49:24.583 --> 49:25.333
The Basque.

49:26.167 --> 49:28.208
The chick's bailed and Beck's out

49:28.417 --> 49:29.792
walking his dog.

49:30.000 --> 49:32.208
He'll keep in touch.

49:35.750 --> 49:38.083
She told us all she knows.
Let's go.

49:39.208 --> 49:40.333
Hit the lights.

50:08.208 --> 50:09.208
You asshole!

50:09.417 --> 50:11.875
C'mon, Nina!

50:43.125 --> 50:44.833
You can't bring a dog in.

50:58.000 --> 50:59.208
You were first.

50:59.417 --> 51:00.750
Number 15.

51:53.750 --> 51:56.750
<i>Hello U2.</i>
You have 1 new message.

52:08.167 --> 52:11.250
<i>Parc Monceau, tomorrow, 5 p.m.</i>
Near the bandstand.

52:11.458 --> 52:13.167
<i>Be careful. I love you.</i>

52:20.000 --> 52:22.417
<i>Parc Monceau, tomorrow, 5 p.m.</i>

52:22.625 --> 52:24.375
<i>Be careful. I love you.</i>

52:39.583 --> 52:42.750
8 years ago, my wife, Margot Beck,
was brought here.

52:43.125 --> 52:45.125
She was one of Serton's victims.

52:46.333 --> 52:48.333
Frank Serton...
Yes?

52:48.917 --> 52:50.958
Did you do the autopsy?

52:51.958 --> 52:52.833
Yes.

52:54.167 --> 52:56.208
Do you photograph the corpses?

52:58.917 --> 53:00.125
Yes, we do.

53:00.500 --> 53:02.833
So you photographed my wife's autopsy?

53:03.583 --> 53:05.542
- Most likely.
- I'd like to see them.

53:07.208 --> 53:10.333
I don't have them here.
The case is closed.

53:11.333 --> 53:13.042
But I can see the report?

53:13.250 --> 53:15.167
Sure, but not today.

53:15.375 --> 53:19.417
You have to request to see it.
There are forms, a procedure.

53:19.625 --> 53:21.625
Okay, I'm making the request.

53:34.833 --> 53:37.125
Capt. Barthas, Crime Squad.

53:37.792 --> 53:40.167
My partner's here with the witnesses.

53:40.708 --> 53:41.875
In the kitchen.

53:53.125 --> 53:55.458
He was the last person you saw?

53:55.875 --> 53:56.917
Yes.

54:00.333 --> 54:03.167
- What time was it?
- I don't know. Around 2 p.m.

54:05.000 --> 54:06.458
She introduce you?

54:07.042 --> 54:08.417
She tell you his name?

54:09.625 --> 54:11.125
Alexandre Beck.

54:59.792 --> 55:01.750
- We found this.
- Where?

55:02.500 --> 55:03.708
A trash can downstairs.

55:04.708 --> 55:08.167
He's going down.
It was a pleasure working with you.

55:08.625 --> 55:12.167
A doctor has latex gloves
in his trash can, big deal.

55:12.375 --> 55:16.417
We'll send it to the lab, though.
Karim, take care of it.

55:16.625 --> 55:18.833
Fuck! Check this out!

55:21.792 --> 55:23.292
Springfield 45.

55:24.708 --> 55:27.417
Patrick! It's all yours.

55:38.333 --> 55:39.417
Look.

55:41.333 --> 55:42.583
It still smells.

55:54.250 --> 55:56.333
But that's not the green one.

55:56.958 --> 55:59.542
Let's look for the green one together.

56:09.500 --> 56:10.917
Is that the green one?

56:11.125 --> 56:12.167
It is?

56:12.375 --> 56:13.917
That's not green.

56:14.125 --> 56:16.583
- It's orange.
- That's orange?

56:16.792 --> 56:18.250
No, that's blue.

56:18.792 --> 56:21.208
- That's orange.
- Very good, that's orange.

56:24.792 --> 56:27.125
Can you find the green one now?

56:30.958 --> 56:33.208
If I don't answer, I'm busy.

56:34.917 --> 56:36.125
Put her through.

56:37.625 --> 56:38.833
Yes, counsel?

56:42.375 --> 56:43.458
Last night? Why?

56:43.667 --> 56:46.833
Because she was shot dead last night
at her studio.

56:57.458 --> 56:58.458
Listen to me.

57:02.292 --> 57:05.833
The murder weapon was in your apartment.
You'll be arrested.

57:06.042 --> 57:07.375
The murder weapon?

57:07.583 --> 57:10.833
That's bullshit.
What were they doing in my apartment?

57:11.042 --> 57:13.167
Later.
They're going to take you in.

57:14.375 --> 57:15.875
I'll try to beat them there.

57:16.083 --> 57:17.375
- Well?
- Coming.

57:18.292 --> 57:20.958
If I get there after them,
stay evasive.

57:22.083 --> 57:24.917
Keep your answers vague, is that clear?

57:25.208 --> 57:27.208
Are you there?

57:27.625 --> 57:29.167
That's the green one.

57:31.083 --> 57:33.833
<i>Just sit tight.</i>
They'll be there any minute.

57:42.417 --> 57:43.958
Not now. No can do.

57:44.583 --> 57:46.042
<i>I'll be right there!</i>

58:16.125 --> 58:17.667
Barthas for Levkowich.

59:17.250 --> 59:18.542
The beltway!

01:00:12.625 --> 01:00:13.833
Round the other side!

01:01:54.250 --> 01:01:56.875
Four, that way!
Vincent, go with them!

01:02:36.750 --> 01:02:38.542
Hello, Bruno?

01:02:38.917 --> 01:02:42.042
Not at all.
In fact, he got in early today.

01:02:42.250 --> 01:02:44.292
Did he seem at all nervous?

01:02:44.750 --> 01:02:46.292
Nobody mention anything?

01:02:46.792 --> 01:02:49.458
Only Mrs. Abidal
after he jumped out the window.

01:02:52.375 --> 01:02:55.292
- He take any private calls?
- Yes. Ms. Feldman.

01:02:58.542 --> 01:03:00.125
You talked to him?

01:03:00.333 --> 01:03:03.083
- What did you say?
- I told him to sit tight.

01:03:03.292 --> 01:03:06.375
- Who tipped you off?
- I don't tell the DA my sources.

01:03:07.875 --> 01:03:10.833
You realize
your client just signed his confession.

01:03:18.792 --> 01:03:19.875
Well?

01:03:20.542 --> 01:03:22.042
I hate being wrong.

01:03:22.250 --> 01:03:23.875
- What about?
- About him.

01:03:24.083 --> 01:03:25.875
I don't care that he lied

01:03:26.083 --> 01:03:28.208
but he should trust me, not run.

01:03:28.417 --> 01:03:30.875
He didn't do anything.
He was scared.

01:03:31.083 --> 01:03:32.917
An innocent man doesn't run.

01:03:34.083 --> 01:03:36.542
I pay you a fortune
to hear shit like that?

01:05:21.167 --> 01:05:21.917
C'mon!

01:05:22.958 --> 01:05:24.083
Follow me.

01:05:36.125 --> 01:05:38.458
Sit on that or the car'll stink!

01:05:43.292 --> 01:05:44.542
Who fired those shots?

01:05:45.542 --> 01:05:46.750
Some pals.

01:05:48.208 --> 01:05:51.250
Beltway's out.
You fucked it up good.

01:06:27.125 --> 01:06:28.875
What? Who?

01:06:30.750 --> 01:06:32.292
Hold on, where are you at?

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:34.375
Get outta there!

01:06:35.708 --> 01:06:36.708
Be right there.

01:06:39.417 --> 01:06:42.417
One little errand,
then we'll get you some clothes.

01:06:55.708 --> 01:06:56.958
The owner?

01:07:13.125 --> 01:07:15.792
Send me it in writing, then.

01:07:18.375 --> 01:07:19.417
Who was that?

01:07:21.708 --> 01:07:23.208
Ballistics.

01:07:23.708 --> 01:07:24.708
About?

01:07:25.542 --> 01:07:26.792
The shotgun.

01:07:27.292 --> 01:07:28.375
And?

01:07:30.583 --> 01:07:33.333
Stop fucking around, they're off!
The gun?

01:07:38.708 --> 01:07:41.458
It was his dad's. François Beck.

01:07:42.333 --> 01:07:43.708
Let me do that.

01:07:47.042 --> 01:07:50.292
It's simple. When his dad died,
he inherited the gun.

01:07:51.292 --> 01:07:53.875
But he smacks his wife around,

01:07:54.083 --> 01:07:56.292
so she hides it with the photos.

01:07:57.125 --> 01:07:59.458
Who pays for the box for 8 years?

01:08:00.208 --> 01:08:01.917
Why's the key on a dead man?

01:08:02.958 --> 01:08:06.208
It's full of holes.
We all know it and we all shut up.

01:08:06.417 --> 01:08:10.375
Who cares about the wife?
He'll get 20 years for the photographer.

01:08:10.583 --> 01:08:12.083
What are you saying?

01:08:12.375 --> 01:08:13.917
You know what I'm saying.

01:08:14.333 --> 01:08:16.417
If we prove Serton didn't kill her,

01:08:16.625 --> 01:08:20.292
he'll get a retrial.
That'd piss a lot of people off.

01:08:20.500 --> 01:08:23.417
What do I care if it pisses people off?

01:08:24.082 --> 01:08:25.792
All I want is the truth.

01:08:26.957 --> 01:08:29.750
I called his lawyer to tip her off.

01:08:30.875 --> 01:08:32.417
Are you stupid?

01:08:32.832 --> 01:08:36.500
For his wife's murder,
a zillion leads and no proof. Why?

01:08:36.750 --> 01:08:39.000
- Because he's good.
- Exactly.

01:08:39.207 --> 01:08:42.542
So tell me why he's dumb enough,
8 years later,

01:08:42.750 --> 01:08:45.250
to keep the murder weapon in his home!

01:08:45.457 --> 01:08:47.375
He could plan his wife's murder

01:08:47.750 --> 01:08:49.582
but now he's under pressure.

01:08:49.792 --> 01:08:50.957
Sure!

01:08:51.167 --> 01:08:55.582
So much so he took time out
to request access to his wife's autopsy

01:08:55.792 --> 01:08:58.417
before heading to his office
to wait for us.

01:09:01.917 --> 01:09:05.457
May I speak to Dr. Herbin
at the medico-legal institute?

01:09:06.625 --> 01:09:08.000
Yes, I'll hold.

01:09:13.707 --> 01:09:17.125
Bye, mom. See you on Sunday.
The groceries are done.

01:09:17.332 --> 01:09:19.250
Thanks, son. See you Sunday.

01:09:19.457 --> 01:09:20.542
Goodbye, Simone.

01:09:41.707 --> 01:09:43.207
<i>Ferrault</i>
Attorney-at-Law

01:09:56.125 --> 01:09:58.833
Sorry, I'm late.
I have an appointment with Mr. Ferrault.

01:09:59.792 --> 01:10:01.000
Are you sure?

01:10:06.458 --> 01:10:07.542
Gentlemen!

01:10:10.333 --> 01:10:13.542
Sorry to press you,
but this is very important.

01:10:14.583 --> 01:10:16.500
Was my wife your client?

01:10:19.083 --> 01:10:21.292
No, she wasn't my client.

01:10:21.500 --> 01:10:23.083
But you met her?

01:10:23.292 --> 01:10:24.292
Yes.

01:10:25.375 --> 01:10:30.125
A few years ago, I was assigned
to defend Helio Gonzales.

01:10:30.792 --> 01:10:31.792
Know who I mean?

01:10:33.250 --> 01:10:36.500
A street kid
raised by the Children's Trust

01:10:36.708 --> 01:10:39.292
your wife worked for
with Philippe Neuville.

01:10:40.458 --> 01:10:43.125
- The showjumper and senator's son.
- And?

01:10:43.333 --> 01:10:46.375
When Neuville's son was found
in a dumpster

01:10:47.208 --> 01:10:50.792
with 2 bullets in him,
Gonzales was the prime suspect.

01:10:51.167 --> 01:10:53.625
He was well known to the police

01:10:54.917 --> 01:10:57.833
and he was seen with Neuville
the night he died.

01:10:58.042 --> 01:11:00.083
- And my wife?
- She was his alibi.

01:11:00.875 --> 01:11:02.125
Meaning?

01:11:04.667 --> 01:11:07.875
At first, she said that,
at the time of the murder,

01:11:08.083 --> 01:11:10.958
he was in her office
for career counseling.

01:11:11.167 --> 01:11:13.458
Of course, nobody bought it.

01:11:13.667 --> 01:11:14.625
Why?

01:11:16.542 --> 01:11:18.958
Career counseling at 11 p.m.?

01:11:21.542 --> 01:11:25.958
Given the penalties for perjury,
I suggested she come clean.

01:11:26.958 --> 01:11:28.333
What did she say?

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:32.333
What did she say?

01:11:34.375 --> 01:11:35.458
Obvious, isn't it?

01:11:41.125 --> 01:11:44.000
She was with Gonzales.
They'd been lovers for 2 months.

01:12:02.542 --> 01:12:05.750
It ain't such a big deal.
You never cheated on her?

01:12:09.042 --> 01:12:09.917
No.

01:12:26.625 --> 01:12:28.250
The guy in the shirt.

01:12:37.708 --> 01:12:39.458
What we doing with this guy?

01:12:39.875 --> 01:12:41.417
Who asked you?

01:12:41.625 --> 01:12:42.750
He staying long?

01:12:43.292 --> 01:12:45.208
I owe this guy from 3 years ago.

01:12:45.708 --> 01:12:48.167
I took my kid to the hospital,
all bruised up.

01:12:49.208 --> 01:12:51.458
Fuckers thought I'd beat up on him.

01:12:51.667 --> 01:12:56.167
This guy tells the cops it wasn't me,
my kid's a hemophiliac.

01:12:56.750 --> 01:12:59.458
As long as he needs us,
we're there, okay?

01:13:00.667 --> 01:13:03.542
Take it easy,
he just wants information.

01:13:04.958 --> 01:13:06.042
Fuck!

01:13:18.583 --> 01:13:19.250
Cool it!

01:13:19.458 --> 01:13:20.542
Stay right there!

01:13:20.750 --> 01:13:22.625
It's cool, guys.

01:13:22.833 --> 01:13:23.958
Back off!

01:13:24.167 --> 01:13:25.958
- It's cool...
- Take it easy.

01:13:27.125 --> 01:13:28.708
What you wanna know?

01:13:28.917 --> 01:13:32.167
Sure, I fucked your wife!
I fucked her for months!

01:13:33.042 --> 01:13:34.042
What's up?

01:13:34.250 --> 01:13:35.208
Shut the fuck up!

01:13:36.458 --> 01:13:39.333
No kidding, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, man.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:42.958
She loved when I spat in her mouth.

01:13:43.333 --> 01:13:45.625
Your wife was a slut.
Don't blame me.

01:13:45.833 --> 01:13:46.958
Let go of me.

01:13:47.250 --> 01:13:49.958
You never fucked my wife!
She was in Lyon.

01:13:50.625 --> 01:13:52.958
I can prove it and wreck your alibi.

01:13:53.500 --> 01:13:55.625
I don't care if you killed Neuville.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:59.292
But I'm accused of murder
and I wanna know why.

01:14:00.542 --> 01:14:05.083
So tell me what you know
or go get your ass fucked off in jail.

01:14:08.833 --> 01:14:11.500
You think jail scares me?
I don't give a shit.

01:14:11.708 --> 01:14:14.167
I didn't kill Neuville.
I was doing business,

01:14:14.708 --> 01:14:17.250
with no alibi,
and she saved my ass.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:18.708
You see her again?

01:14:18.917 --> 01:14:20.167
She's dead, man!

01:14:20.375 --> 01:14:21.375
Why'd she do it?

01:14:21.583 --> 01:14:24.292
How do I know?
She gave me a story. I said it.

01:14:24.500 --> 01:14:26.583
Now, get out of my face, faggot!

01:14:50.167 --> 01:14:53.083
You're crazy, man!
Why we here if it was a lie?

01:14:53.375 --> 01:14:55.167
I wasn't sure. I was bluffing.

01:14:55.875 --> 01:14:57.167
You were bluffing?

01:14:58.750 --> 01:15:00.917
You're a total headcase!

01:15:05.625 --> 01:15:08.583
Good one. "I was bluffing..."
Motherfucker!

01:15:17.667 --> 01:15:21.792
I thought if the cops got her husband,
she'd show up to help him.

01:15:26.917 --> 01:15:29.250
I've no idea how he got away.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.250
I didn't know she'd set up a meeting.

01:15:42.667 --> 01:15:44.583
No, I don't know where he is.

01:15:47.625 --> 01:15:48.917
Okay, I'll call you back.

01:17:28.875 --> 01:17:31.375
Excuse me,
do you have the time, please?

01:17:32.583 --> 01:17:34.333
- Just after 5.
- Thanks.

01:17:46.167 --> 01:17:48.875
I don't know if it's her
but the kid's real.

01:17:49.708 --> 01:17:51.375
She look like the photo?

01:17:52.167 --> 01:17:54.208
I don't know. The eyes maybe...

01:19:17.042 --> 01:19:19.167
She's leaving.
What do I do? Grab her?

01:19:24.875 --> 01:19:27.208
She's headed for the gate.
Zach, she's yours!

01:19:27.417 --> 01:19:28.750
I'll stay with him.

01:19:57.875 --> 01:19:59.875
It's not her. Back off!

01:20:01.417 --> 01:20:02.542
You hear me?

01:20:02.750 --> 01:20:04.542
Get back in position.

01:20:19.708 --> 01:20:22.958
<i>He's leaving. What do I do?</i>

01:20:23.958 --> 01:20:26.250
I repeat.
He's leaving. What do I do?

01:20:32.292 --> 01:20:33.667
He's coming this way.

01:20:35.125 --> 01:20:36.250
<i>Bernard?</i>

01:20:40.750 --> 01:20:42.292
Grab him!

01:21:08.833 --> 01:21:10.917
Keep calm!

01:21:20.292 --> 01:21:22.000
What do you want?

01:21:41.250 --> 01:21:42.667
Where's your wife?

01:21:43.958 --> 01:21:44.542
I don't know.

01:21:50.208 --> 01:21:50.833
Where is she?

01:21:54.875 --> 01:21:56.083
I don't know!

01:21:58.625 --> 01:21:59.542
Where's your wife?

01:22:01.167 --> 01:22:02.667
Where's Margot?

01:22:05.667 --> 01:22:07.375
Move it, asshole!

01:22:09.833 --> 01:22:11.125
Freeze!

01:22:12.292 --> 01:22:14.250
Stand up!

01:22:20.375 --> 01:22:22.125
Untie him!

01:22:24.083 --> 01:22:26.333
Untie him, shithead!

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:33.083
You okay?

01:22:34.083 --> 01:22:35.667
Who you working for?

01:22:52.583 --> 01:22:54.208
Don't move!

01:23:29.458 --> 01:23:30.833
Holy fucking shit!

01:23:35.292 --> 01:23:36.083
Floor it!

01:24:11.792 --> 01:24:12.792
<i>Eric?</i>

01:24:13.167 --> 01:24:16.042
<i>Beck is booked on a flight</i>
for Buenos Aires at 10:30 p.m.

01:24:16.250 --> 01:24:16.875
Wait for me.

01:24:19.375 --> 01:24:21.375
Philippe had just turned 5.

01:24:21.958 --> 01:24:24.625
We were waiting for the school bus.

01:24:24.833 --> 01:24:26.667
I was holding his hand.

01:24:29.292 --> 01:24:31.042
The bus arrived.

01:24:31.625 --> 01:24:34.583
The doors opened
and he suddenly let go of my hand...

01:24:36.750 --> 01:24:38.792
and jumped on the bus.

01:24:40.333 --> 01:24:44.000
I had this incredible urge
to pull him back...

01:24:45.583 --> 01:24:46.958
and take him home.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.250
That's when I understood
what I had felt

01:24:52.458 --> 01:24:54.292
the day he was born.

01:24:55.042 --> 01:24:58.458
A blend of joy and apprehension
and also...

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:00.708
terror.

01:25:05.083 --> 01:25:09.083
I sensed that despite my efforts
something could happen to him...

01:25:10.708 --> 01:25:11.917
at any time.

01:25:15.458 --> 01:25:17.167
I'm scared of disease.

01:25:18.542 --> 01:25:21.458
I'm scared of aging
and I'm scared of death.

01:25:23.708 --> 01:25:26.708
But it's nothing compared
to what I felt that day,

01:25:26.917 --> 01:25:30.458
the knot in my stomach
as I watched the bus drive away.

01:25:34.958 --> 01:25:37.000
While my son rots underground...

01:25:41.208 --> 01:25:42.792
she may be still alive?

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.042
I can't accept that, Bernard.

01:25:47.500 --> 01:25:49.167
Do you understand that?

01:25:51.292 --> 01:25:52.792
Do you?

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:54.667
I understand, sir.

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.417
<i>Passengers for the flight</i>
to Buenos Aires

01:26:53.625 --> 01:26:57.000
<i>are invited to proceed...</i>

01:27:14.958 --> 01:27:19.708
<i>Charlotte Bertaud was shot in the head</i>
at point blank range.

01:27:19.917 --> 01:27:24.000
<i>A suspect, Dr. Alexandre Beck,</i>
escaped arrest this morning.

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:30.792
<i>He is also suspected of...</i>

01:27:31.083 --> 01:27:32.625
Caroline Parreire!

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:34.000
There!

01:27:34.875 --> 01:27:37.125
She booked her ticket
6 minutes after Mr. Beck.

01:27:37.333 --> 01:27:39.458
She had the seat next to his.

01:27:39.667 --> 01:27:42.125
Row 32, seats E and F.

01:27:42.417 --> 01:27:44.083
She checked in?

01:27:46.292 --> 01:27:48.000
Yes, she must be boarding.

01:27:48.208 --> 01:27:49.417
Gate F50.

01:28:04.667 --> 01:28:06.375
Enjoy your trip.

01:28:22.833 --> 01:28:24.250
Out of the way! Police!

01:28:28.333 --> 01:28:30.875
Everybody, stay where you are!

01:28:31.375 --> 01:28:33.208
Stop boarding immediately!

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.542
Let me see some ID or your passport.

01:28:58.667 --> 01:29:00.583
Not fair! My stick's not working.

01:29:00.792 --> 01:29:02.917
- Always got an excuse.
- Smart ass!

01:29:03.333 --> 01:29:04.708
Check it out!

01:29:08.417 --> 01:29:09.625
I don't believe it!

01:29:09.833 --> 01:29:12.042
- He did you good!
- It's the stick.

01:29:13.167 --> 01:29:14.958
I always get the dud.

01:29:15.167 --> 01:29:17.667
He always blames some shit.

01:29:18.583 --> 01:29:19.792
Hey, no shoes!

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.333
Give us a break with your scuzzy carpet!

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:23.583
Well?

01:29:25.917 --> 01:29:27.375
I don't get it. Nothing.

01:29:30.042 --> 01:29:31.458
Mouss, c'mon!

01:29:36.917 --> 01:29:38.042
I'm sorry.

01:29:39.292 --> 01:29:40.583
Really.

01:29:41.333 --> 01:29:42.625
Forget it.

01:29:48.917 --> 01:29:51.583
I'll send a guy for my son
when he's better.

01:29:52.208 --> 01:29:52.958
Okay, guys!

01:29:53.167 --> 01:29:54.000
See ya!

01:30:21.750 --> 01:30:23.000
Hold the line.

01:30:25.292 --> 01:30:26.917
<i>This is Alexandre Beck.</i>

01:30:28.708 --> 01:30:30.958
<i>I can prove I didn't kill Charlotte.</i>

01:30:31.583 --> 01:30:32.833
You can?

01:30:34.458 --> 01:30:36.833
Hold on while I step outside.

01:30:41.875 --> 01:30:43.083
Go ahead.

01:30:45.083 --> 01:30:46.333
Good evening.

01:30:46.542 --> 01:30:49.250
Captain Levkowich.
We met at the hospital.

01:30:50.292 --> 01:30:51.917
Can I have a word?

01:30:52.125 --> 01:30:54.583
Sorry, my wife's expecting me home.

01:30:54.792 --> 01:30:57.333
I don't believe Beck killed anyone.

01:31:02.750 --> 01:31:04.833
Right now, I'm the only one.

01:31:05.042 --> 01:31:08.375
- You're the smarty-pants, right?
- That's right.

01:31:09.375 --> 01:31:13.708
But I'll need your help.
You must know where he's hiding.

01:31:14.458 --> 01:31:16.042
Correction. You're the dummy!

01:31:16.250 --> 01:31:19.167
If you don't help me,
we'll find him anyway.

01:31:19.792 --> 01:31:22.000
When we do, it could get nasty.

01:31:23.042 --> 01:31:25.708
He was booked on a flight
to Buenos Aires.

01:31:27.583 --> 01:31:29.500
Of course, he didn't show

01:31:29.708 --> 01:31:33.125
but he was traveling
with one Caroline Parreire. Know her?

01:31:35.542 --> 01:31:36.792
Hold that.

01:31:47.375 --> 01:31:48.417
Well?

01:31:51.042 --> 01:31:52.042
What?

01:31:52.458 --> 01:31:54.000
Caroline Parreire?

01:31:54.542 --> 01:31:55.583
Never heard of her.

01:31:59.042 --> 01:32:01.792
- Did Margot Beck do drugs?
- No way. You're nuts!

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.292
The autopsy report suggests otherwise.

01:32:06.958 --> 01:32:09.458
- It's confidential.
- You're shitting me?

01:32:11.333 --> 01:32:13.375
Show me a photo. Just one photo.

01:32:13.583 --> 01:32:15.833
Funny, I had the same reaction.

01:32:16.167 --> 01:32:18.208
There aren't any.
They vanished.

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:40.667
A problem?

01:32:57.917 --> 01:32:59.667
- Did he call?
- No.

01:33:11.583 --> 01:33:12.792
Hélène?

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:14.042
What?

01:33:18.833 --> 01:33:20.292
What's wrong?

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:24.292
The photos...

01:33:25.708 --> 01:33:27.625
I took them.

01:33:34.167 --> 01:33:36.583
It was Philippe Neuville
who beat her up.

01:33:46.458 --> 01:33:47.583
Why?

01:33:48.250 --> 01:33:51.375
I don't know.
She wouldn't tell me.

01:33:54.417 --> 01:33:55.917
And you did nothing?

01:33:56.667 --> 01:33:59.375
- What could I do?
- Take her to the cops.

01:33:59.583 --> 01:34:03.708
She refused to go.
She said she just needed evidence.

01:34:08.250 --> 01:34:10.708
She wouldn't even let me tell you.

01:34:12.667 --> 01:34:14.708
And you never said anything?

01:34:15.500 --> 01:34:17.625
What d'you expect me to do?

01:34:18.292 --> 01:34:21.500
Tell my brother
while he's mourning his dead wife,

01:34:21.708 --> 01:34:25.167
that just before she died,
she got beaten to crap?

01:34:25.458 --> 01:34:27.417
Would that have helped him?

01:34:28.125 --> 01:34:30.167
She asked me to keep it secret.

01:34:30.375 --> 01:34:32.042
No kidding.

01:34:32.875 --> 01:34:33.875
What?

01:34:35.208 --> 01:34:39.917
You rode Neuville's horses.
If you'd accused his son of battery,

01:34:40.625 --> 01:34:42.958
you'd have been fired.

01:34:43.167 --> 01:34:45.458
It was a smart choice asking you.

01:34:47.167 --> 01:34:49.750
She knew you'd keep your mouth shut.

01:35:14.542 --> 01:35:16.042
Yes, Elisabeth?

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.083
I'll email you one right away.

01:35:23.875 --> 01:35:25.167
Thanks a lot.

01:35:36.625 --> 01:35:39.542
A briard. Cute, huh?

01:35:39.750 --> 01:35:41.417
You're helping a fugitive...

01:35:41.833 --> 01:35:44.292
Shut up or the dog
will piss on your career.

01:35:46.625 --> 01:35:48.792
You established Charlotte's
time of death

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:50.750
as 10:45 p.m., right?

01:35:52.042 --> 01:35:53.250
Give or take 30'.

01:35:53.458 --> 01:35:55.417
This dog proves Beck is innocent.

01:35:55.875 --> 01:35:58.083
He was on a computer at Medianet

01:35:58.292 --> 01:36:01.500
between 10:36 and 11:13,
according to their records.

01:36:02.250 --> 01:36:05.083
He was told to leave the dog outside.

01:36:06.250 --> 01:36:09.417
2 witnesses have positively
identified him.

01:36:22.583 --> 01:36:24.333
Assuming the alibi checks out...

01:36:24.667 --> 01:36:25.875
Don't worry, it will.

01:36:26.583 --> 01:36:28.250
Assuming it does...

01:36:29.375 --> 01:36:31.000
There's just one hitch.

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.375
The murder weapon we found at his place.

01:36:34.583 --> 01:36:38.500
Trouble is, the tables have turned.
That's now your problem.

01:36:39.917 --> 01:36:44.000
Tell the press your men planted evidence
without your knowledge.

01:36:44.208 --> 01:36:47.583
At worst, you're a coward.
At best, a DA with no authority.

01:36:49.125 --> 01:36:50.542
Are you crazy?

01:36:51.250 --> 01:36:53.292
Who'd believe they'd do that?

01:36:53.708 --> 01:36:54.958
Nobody!

01:37:03.542 --> 01:37:07.708
So tell the press
Dr. Beck is wanted as a witness,

01:37:07.917 --> 01:37:10.500
the last man to see the victim alive,

01:37:11.417 --> 01:37:13.458
and is suspected of nothing.

01:37:14.042 --> 01:37:15.000
Agreed?

01:37:19.292 --> 01:37:20.500
He'll answer questions?

01:37:21.083 --> 01:37:22.917
Don't pretend you can negotiate.

01:37:43.458 --> 01:37:45.792
I promised to keep it a secret.

01:37:49.250 --> 01:37:50.875
I never meant to hurt you.

01:38:01.333 --> 01:38:02.875
Say you forgive me.

01:38:06.375 --> 01:38:07.833
Thanks for telling me.

01:38:27.333 --> 01:38:28.083
Did you know?

01:38:30.042 --> 01:38:32.250
- About Neuville?
- Of course not!

01:38:34.333 --> 01:38:37.542
I saw her.
I swear to you I saw her.

01:38:38.250 --> 01:38:39.750
I believe you.

01:38:42.333 --> 01:38:43.417
Come here...

01:38:57.917 --> 01:39:00.167
Don't worry, just a courtesy visit.

01:39:00.375 --> 01:39:02.042
We'd like to apologize.

01:39:43.875 --> 01:39:46.917
<i>Traces of heroin...</i>
regular user...

01:39:56.708 --> 01:39:59.208
<i>Weight: 49kg</i>
Height: 1.75m

01:40:12.417 --> 01:40:14.417
- It's not her!
- Really, why?

01:40:14.833 --> 01:40:17.625
She was never 1 .75m tall!
Where are the photos?

01:40:17.833 --> 01:40:18.458
There are none.

01:40:18.667 --> 01:40:20.667
- They think they were stolen.
- Who by?

01:40:20.875 --> 01:40:24.625
The only person to request the file.
Mr. Laurentin, Margot's father.

01:40:53.500 --> 01:40:55.542
Did your father own a gun?

01:40:57.042 --> 01:40:59.375
A hunting rifle you inherited?

01:41:01.708 --> 01:41:03.125
Do you know where it is?

01:41:04.792 --> 01:41:06.583
In my cellar, I guess.

01:41:08.375 --> 01:41:09.708
You're not sure?

01:41:10.417 --> 01:41:14.125
I moved house 8 years ago.
It must be in a box someplace.

01:41:14.333 --> 01:41:15.208
I don't think so.

01:41:16.208 --> 01:41:20.208
It was in Juliette Langlois'
safety-deposit box. With the photos.

01:41:23.833 --> 01:41:26.417
I don't have to talk to you.
Call my attorney.

01:41:33.708 --> 01:41:34.917
Pierre Ferrault?

01:41:36.500 --> 01:41:37.875
Elisabeth Feldman.

01:41:38.083 --> 01:41:40.917
That's a relief.
Ferrault called us...

01:41:41.583 --> 01:41:44.042
I thought you'd maybe changed lawyers.

01:41:44.250 --> 01:41:47.167
We were surprised
you'd go for a washout like him.

01:41:47.542 --> 01:41:49.667
Ferrault's the pits, you know that?

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:51.625
Why did you go to see him?

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.167
To retrace my wife's last days.

01:41:54.375 --> 01:41:55.000
Why?

01:41:55.208 --> 01:41:57.792
I agree with you
that Serton didn't kill her.

01:41:59.125 --> 01:42:01.833
- Ferrault confirmed that?
- No, it was a dead end.

01:42:02.042 --> 01:42:04.417
But he told you
about Philippe Neuville?

01:42:05.500 --> 01:42:07.708
What's he got to do with Margot?

01:42:09.292 --> 01:42:12.208
That's what I decided to find out.

01:42:14.125 --> 01:42:16.583
- Meaning?
- I ran some tests on that rifle.

01:42:19.167 --> 01:42:20.792
Know what we found?

01:42:24.583 --> 01:42:26.917
It was the gun
that killed Philippe Neuville.

01:42:28.542 --> 01:42:31.000
Of course, I'm not accusing you yet.

01:42:31.208 --> 01:42:34.000
I won't risk
looking a total idiot twice.

01:42:34.208 --> 01:42:36.708
I don't mind. I'll take the risk.

01:42:37.833 --> 01:42:40.292
For Alexandre Beck
care of Hélène Perkins.

01:42:40.500 --> 01:42:42.125
Sign for it, please.

01:42:45.375 --> 01:42:47.542
<i>For Alex</i>

01:43:26.458 --> 01:43:28.125
I'm in the kitchen.

01:43:52.750 --> 01:43:54.750
What the hell are you doing?

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.292
- Where's Martine?
- In a safe place.

01:43:58.500 --> 01:44:00.375
- A safe place?
- Move!

01:44:04.083 --> 01:44:05.958
What's this about Neuville?

01:44:06.167 --> 01:44:08.333
Who was cremated 8 years ago?

01:44:10.500 --> 01:44:11.708
Sit down.

01:44:14.458 --> 01:44:16.750
I read the autopsy. It wasn't Margot.

01:44:16.958 --> 01:44:19.125
Sit down, I said!

01:44:39.708 --> 01:44:41.708
- Have you seen her?
- I think so.

01:44:42.708 --> 01:44:44.000
Where is she?

01:44:45.417 --> 01:44:46.083
I don't know.

01:44:46.958 --> 01:44:49.500
- She's in trouble.
- You think you can help?

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.083
You couldn't 8 years ago.

01:44:54.292 --> 01:44:55.625
Sit down!

01:44:55.833 --> 01:44:57.417
I was out cold.

01:44:59.083 --> 01:45:00.750
I know. I was there.

01:45:01.875 --> 01:45:02.875
What?

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:07.583
For the last time,
get your ass on that couch!

01:45:12.792 --> 01:45:16.083
Have you any idea
how much I miss your daughter?

01:45:25.958 --> 01:45:27.083
Sit down.

01:46:07.375 --> 01:46:09.750
2 months before Margot disappeared,

01:46:10.250 --> 01:46:13.208
a kid from the Trust came to see her.

01:46:15.208 --> 01:46:17.125
He seemed very on edge.

01:46:18.792 --> 01:46:21.083
Margot tried to find out why.

01:46:22.875 --> 01:46:27.125
After a half hour,
the kid bursts into tears and says

01:46:27.917 --> 01:46:31.375
that Neuville's son
has been raping him for months.

01:46:32.750 --> 01:46:36.792
Margot asked Neuville to stop by.
You were in Bordeaux.

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:38.583
- Let go!
- That's not all!

01:46:39.625 --> 01:46:41.083
- We need to talk!
- No way!

01:46:41.667 --> 01:46:44.583
Tell me the truth, Philippe.
Please!

01:46:45.875 --> 01:46:46.875
I never hurt them.

01:46:56.958 --> 01:46:57.833
Stop it!

01:47:17.750 --> 01:47:21.292
<i>She'd asked me to arrest him</i>
if she got him to confess.

01:47:22.292 --> 01:47:25.583
I couldn't stand there and watch.

01:47:33.875 --> 01:47:36.417
<i>I killed him with your father's gun.</i>

01:47:38.125 --> 01:47:40.667
<i>Then I dumped the body.</i>

01:47:42.167 --> 01:47:43.458
What's that crackling?

01:47:43.667 --> 01:47:45.208
The signal's fine.

01:47:47.958 --> 01:47:49.917
- He found it.
- Sit down.

01:47:50.208 --> 01:47:51.958
He's found the wire!
Let's go!

01:47:52.583 --> 01:47:54.542
Nobody moves! Is that clear?

01:47:54.750 --> 01:47:56.667
Nobody moves until I say so.

01:47:59.958 --> 01:48:02.583
<i>There was this street kid,</i>
Gonzales...

01:48:04.417 --> 01:48:06.208
He'd done jail time.

01:48:06.833 --> 01:48:08.333
<i>The ideal fall guy.</i>

01:48:08.542 --> 01:48:10.750
<i>It would have been all so simple.</i>

01:48:11.667 --> 01:48:12.958
<i>But...</i>

01:48:13.583 --> 01:48:15.292
she couldn't stand that idea.

01:48:16.458 --> 01:48:19.583
Next day, she asked your sister
to take the photos.

01:48:20.875 --> 01:48:25.583
She thought she could use them
if Neuville's dad ever suspected us.

01:48:27.250 --> 01:48:29.292
And he soon did

01:48:29.500 --> 01:48:32.000
after Margot got Gonzales
off the hook.

01:48:37.250 --> 01:48:38.375
And then...

01:48:39.875 --> 01:48:43.292
she called Neuville to tell him
she had evidence

01:48:43.500 --> 01:48:45.125
against his son.

01:48:45.417 --> 01:48:46.958
Knowing old Neuville,

01:48:47.292 --> 01:48:49.958
I knew exactly what he would do.

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.125
So I tapped his phone.

01:48:53.333 --> 01:48:55.167
He hired the goons at the lake?

01:48:55.375 --> 01:48:57.375
Bartola and Pagnac.

01:48:58.958 --> 01:49:00.083
He paid them

01:49:00.292 --> 01:49:02.833
<i>to get the evidence and get rid of her.</i>

01:49:03.708 --> 01:49:05.625
<i>What saved Margot's life</i>

01:49:05.833 --> 01:49:08.667
<i>is that one was an even bigger scumbag.</i>

01:49:17.333 --> 01:49:20.125
<i>I offered to pay Bartola double</i>

01:49:20.333 --> 01:49:22.458
<i>if he agreed to change the plan.</i>

01:49:30.750 --> 01:49:32.542
You pulled me out of the water?

01:49:51.208 --> 01:49:53.667
<i>Bartola respected his side of the deal.</i>

01:49:59.542 --> 01:50:00.625
<i>Not me.</i>

01:50:11.708 --> 01:50:16.042
The only way to calm Neuville
was if Margot disappeared.

01:50:16.458 --> 01:50:18.333
I knew they planned to make out

01:50:18.542 --> 01:50:21.167
<i>she was one of Serton's victims.</i>

01:50:21.625 --> 01:50:23.417
<i>I had to find a corpse.</i>

01:50:24.542 --> 01:50:26.708
<i>I was thinking of digging one up</i>

01:50:28.417 --> 01:50:30.667
<i>when I took a call at work.</i>

01:50:30.875 --> 01:50:33.375
<i>A junkie had been knifed</i>
by the station.

01:50:33.583 --> 01:50:35.208
<i>I went alone.</i>

01:50:36.542 --> 01:50:39.750
<i>I dumped the body maybe 100km away.</i>

01:50:55.333 --> 01:50:59.458
I made sure I got there quickly
for the identification.

01:50:59.875 --> 01:51:01.500
You were in the hospital.

01:51:02.458 --> 01:51:04.833
Why would a father lie anyway?

01:51:05.792 --> 01:51:08.125
Everybody bought it.

01:51:17.958 --> 01:51:19.792
She knew about the abduction?

01:51:21.375 --> 01:51:23.583
She would have told you.

01:51:24.667 --> 01:51:27.583
You'd have gone to the cops
and we'd all be dead.

01:51:28.833 --> 01:51:32.125
<i>Old man Neuville has every cop and DA</i>
on his payroll.

01:51:32.333 --> 01:51:35.708
<i>I should know.</i>
I was top of the list.

01:51:38.542 --> 01:51:41.583
- Where'd she go?
- I bought her a ticket for Madrid.

01:51:44.167 --> 01:51:45.667
I don't know if she stayed.

01:51:46.917 --> 01:51:48.125
Never any news?

01:51:48.333 --> 01:51:49.333
No.

01:51:51.417 --> 01:51:53.125
So, why now?

01:51:55.750 --> 01:51:59.708
The press coverage
of those 2 bodies they dug up.

01:52:02.625 --> 01:52:04.250
Your name got mentioned.

01:52:05.500 --> 01:52:07.292
I guess she realized I'd lied.

01:52:10.667 --> 01:52:14.000
When Margot came round,
she asked where you were.

01:52:15.750 --> 01:52:17.875
<i>I couldn't tell her the truth.</i>

01:52:23.375 --> 01:52:24.875
<i>It was the only answer</i>

01:52:25.083 --> 01:52:27.458
or else she'd never have gone.

01:52:28.375 --> 01:52:30.333
She truly would be dead today.

01:52:32.250 --> 01:52:33.542
What did you tell her?

01:52:35.083 --> 01:52:36.208
That you were dead.

01:52:38.458 --> 01:52:39.333
There's more.

01:52:53.375 --> 01:52:55.167
I did it for her, Alex.

01:52:56.917 --> 01:52:57.792
For all of us.

01:53:00.167 --> 01:53:02.417
<i>My only mistake was the key.</i>

01:53:04.083 --> 01:53:08.125
<i>Bartola had taken it</i>
out of Margot's purse.

01:53:08.792 --> 01:53:11.167
<i>I forgot to check their pockets.</i>

01:53:12.750 --> 01:53:15.542
Neuville wouldn't let it drop.

01:53:16.583 --> 01:53:18.792
He kept a close eye on you and me.

01:53:20.750 --> 01:53:24.042
The burglary at your house
just after her death...

01:53:24.833 --> 01:53:27.292
I mean, disappearance.
That was them.

01:53:28.083 --> 01:53:29.625
Looking for the key.

01:53:30.708 --> 01:53:33.625
Why didn't you say?
Why didn't she file charges?

01:53:35.292 --> 01:53:36.875
It was too late.

01:53:38.792 --> 01:53:40.792
I'd already crossed the line.

01:53:41.875 --> 01:53:45.625
Your dad had come to see me
6 months earlier.

01:53:46.542 --> 01:53:47.792
My father?

01:53:48.583 --> 01:53:49.792
<i>One evening,</i>

01:53:50.417 --> 01:53:53.708
<i>he stayed late at the stables</i>
with a sick horse.

01:54:07.208 --> 01:54:09.208
Léa, what's wrong?

01:54:15.375 --> 01:54:18.708
Philippe?
What's wrong with little Léa?

01:54:18.917 --> 01:54:20.792
- I can explain.
- You don't have to.

01:54:22.042 --> 01:54:23.875
I understand perfectly!

01:54:24.917 --> 01:54:26.875
Do you know how old she is?

01:54:27.083 --> 01:54:28.583
- Get out!
- No, I won't. You're...

01:54:28.792 --> 01:54:31.125
Get out! Go!

01:54:32.375 --> 01:54:33.750
Get the fuck out!

01:54:34.542 --> 01:54:36.000
You're on my property!

01:54:36.208 --> 01:54:39.667
If I was younger, I'd kick your ass.
But I'll make you pay.

01:54:40.375 --> 01:54:43.042
You're scum!
I'll make sure action's taken!

01:54:43.250 --> 01:54:44.208
<i>She was one</i>

01:54:44.417 --> 01:54:46.250
of the kids
he and Margot worked with.

01:54:47.500 --> 01:54:49.917
Lots of them helped out
at the stables,

01:54:50.375 --> 01:54:51.750
do you remember?

01:54:52.500 --> 01:54:55.083
<i>Next day,</i>
he came to file a complaint.

01:54:55.292 --> 01:54:57.417
I won't calm down!
That won't help.

01:54:57.625 --> 01:55:01.417
<i>I tried to persuade him</i>
to talk to Neuville but...

01:55:03.125 --> 01:55:05.000
<i>he just brushed me off.</i>

01:55:17.250 --> 01:55:19.208
<i>Neuville loved your dad.</i>

01:55:20.083 --> 01:55:23.042
<i>He'd been a trainer at the stables</i>
for years.

01:55:24.083 --> 01:55:25.750
<i>He taught his son to ride.</i>

01:55:34.375 --> 01:55:36.333
<i>I thought it would stop there.</i>

01:55:46.542 --> 01:55:47.625
Thank you.

01:55:49.292 --> 01:55:52.708
<i>But Neuville knew</i>
François would talk eventually.

01:56:22.208 --> 01:56:23.875
It's all in there.

01:56:24.333 --> 01:56:26.417
Names and addresses of Neuville's men.

01:56:27.792 --> 01:56:29.833
Details of every rotten affair

01:56:30.125 --> 01:56:33.625
I got mixed up in with him.

01:56:35.333 --> 01:56:37.833
<i>Including the Angeneau assassination</i>

01:56:38.042 --> 01:56:39.625
<i>in 1995.</i>

01:56:56.125 --> 01:56:58.917
Your father didn't die
in a hunting accident.

01:57:04.250 --> 01:57:05.875
They killed him.

01:57:24.542 --> 01:57:26.458
Stop! Don't shoot!

01:58:40.875 --> 01:58:42.792
<i>What a fine partnership!</i>

01:58:51.375 --> 01:58:53.375
<i>In the ring now is Rimsky</i>

01:58:53.583 --> 01:58:55.875
<i>ridden by Hervé de Luze!</i>

01:59:19.833 --> 01:59:21.083
Mr. Neuville?

01:59:21.875 --> 01:59:24.000
Captain Barthas of the Crime Squad.

01:59:24.792 --> 01:59:26.708
Will you follow me, please?

01:59:28.125 --> 01:59:29.167
Gilbert?

01:59:30.042 --> 01:59:32.375
What's wrong? What's going on?

01:59:34.625 --> 01:59:36.000
Tell me.

01:59:41.625 --> 01:59:43.333
Please follow me.

02:00:24.542 --> 02:00:26.833
What the hell are you doing?

02:00:36.375 --> 02:00:38.833
I killed him with your father's gun.

02:00:40.583 --> 02:00:43.333
Then I dumped the body.

02:00:47.750 --> 02:00:52.000
I know you have a wire.
I know they're listening.

02:00:54.167 --> 02:00:56.167
Now I'll tell you the truth.

02:01:25.333 --> 02:01:26.250
Margot! Wait!
