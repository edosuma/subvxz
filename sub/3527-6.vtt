<i>~ Season 1 - Episode 6 ~
"True Love"</i>

01:31.600 --> 01:35.400
"Dear heart,
I cannot say how much I miss you.

01:35.900 --> 01:38.000
I wish myself,
especially in the evening...

01:38.300 --> 01:40.700
...in my sweetheart's arms, whose..."

01:43.600 --> 01:45.400
Pray continue.

01:48.800 --> 01:52.000
"Whose pretty breasts
I trust shortly to kiss.

01:52.400 --> 01:56.200
Neither tongue nor pen can
express the hurt of not seeing you.

01:56.500 --> 02:00.800
The only compensation is the thrill
of anticipating our next meeting.

02:04.800 --> 02:06.900
For what joy in this world
can be greater...

02:07.200 --> 02:10.900
...than to have the company of her
who is the most dearly loved?"

02:17.200 --> 02:20.100
Well, the king
is plainly in love with you.

02:23.200 --> 02:26.800
Don't you see, niece?

02:27.700 --> 02:33.900
It makes a man, any man,
extremely vulnerable.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
How do you like
your charge, sweetheart?

02:39.400 --> 02:41.000
I...

02:44.500 --> 02:47.100
At first, I confess,
I did not like it so much.

02:47.400 --> 02:49.700
I did not care for the king.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
But now, I...

02:54.400 --> 02:56.000
- Now I...
- Anne.

02:56.300 --> 03:00.100
It would be wise for you not to be
fooled by your own masquerade.

03:00.400 --> 03:03.100
It is your duty to use his love...

03:03.500 --> 03:06.900
...to our advantage
in supplanting Wolsey.

03:11.400 --> 03:16.100
The cardinal
stands between us and everything.

03:17.000 --> 03:20.800
And it is now in your power
to do him a great hurt.

03:21.200 --> 03:23.600
And we expect you to do so.

03:26.800 --> 03:29.200
I shall go straight to Paris
to meet King Francis...

03:29.500 --> 03:32.400
...and ratify the new treaty
between Your Majesties.

03:32.900 --> 03:36.700
And since His Holiness
remains a prisoner of the emperor...

03:37.000 --> 03:39.500
...I have summoned
a conclave of the cardinals...

03:39.900 --> 03:41.500
...to meet in Paris.

03:42.400 --> 03:46.900
It will be little matter to persuade
them, in the absence of the Pope...

03:47.300 --> 03:50.100
...to grant me licence and authority...

03:50.400 --> 03:53.700
...to make a final judgement
on Your Majesty's annulment.

03:56.600 --> 03:57.900
You leave with our blessing.

03:58.800 --> 04:01.600
And with anticipation of your
success, Your Eminence.

04:02.100 --> 04:04.500
For which we are most impatient.

04:05.400 --> 04:08.000
I'm Your Majesty's
true and humble servant.

04:09.500 --> 04:10.700
Oh, I forgot.

04:12.400 --> 04:14.300
There is someone you should take.

04:14.600 --> 04:16.800
His name is Thomas Wyatt.

04:17.700 --> 04:20.899
- The poet?
- I don't like him.

04:21.300 --> 04:24.000
He once possessed
a jewel I would have.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.700
Lady Anne, what are you doing here?

04:37.500 --> 04:40.100
I have an audience with His Majesty.

04:43.800 --> 04:46.800
What would a silly girl like you
have to say to a king?

04:52.400 --> 04:53.700
Your Majesty.

05:19.400 --> 05:21.600
Tell me he'll succeed.

05:22.600 --> 05:24.300
Who, sweetheart?

05:24.600 --> 05:26.100
Wolsey.

05:26.300 --> 05:29.100
He will, won't he?
He'll get an annulment?

05:30.000 --> 05:31.900
Of course he will.

05:32.200 --> 05:34.600
Don't you doubt it.

05:40.500 --> 05:41.600
What is it?

05:45.000 --> 05:46.700
Is it not strange?

05:47.500 --> 05:48.800
Strange?

05:50.300 --> 05:55.500
To trust so great a matter
to just one servant, whoever he is?

05:55.900 --> 05:58.100
When Your Majesty
has a thousand servants...

05:58.400 --> 06:00.200
...ready and willing
to do your bidding?

06:00.500 --> 06:03.400
And when your very happiness
hangs upon this resolution.

06:05.700 --> 06:07.300
My love.

06:08.600 --> 06:10.900
This should not concern you.

06:14.900 --> 06:16.900
Forgive me.
I spoke of things I should not.

06:17.200 --> 06:19.100
No, no.

06:19.400 --> 06:22.400
I give you leave that we may always
speak freely with each other.

06:22.700 --> 06:26.600
Honestly, openly
and with a true heart.

06:27.400 --> 06:30.300
For me,
that is the true definition of love.

06:55.700 --> 06:57.900
Forgive me, ambassador,
for receiving you here.

06:58.200 --> 07:00.500
I am at Your Majesty's disposal.

07:11.600 --> 07:14.100
Senor Mendoza, help me.

07:14.600 --> 07:17.400
Of course, I am Your Majesty's.

07:18.900 --> 07:23.600
I need to get a message to the emperor.
I have no other way.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
Wolsey opens all my letters.

07:26.300 --> 07:30.300
And now I know that he has turned
several of my women into his spies.

07:32.100 --> 07:33.700
By what means?

07:35.400 --> 07:41.800
By money, or even, so they tell me,
by granting them sexual favours.

07:46.300 --> 07:48.200
Dear God. How can I help?

07:48.600 --> 07:51.000
The emperor is the head
of my family.

07:51.300 --> 07:54.900
I want him to know that
the king is trying to divorce me.

07:55.200 --> 07:59.000
He wants to keep it secret, but he has
already instigated proceedings.

07:59.900 --> 08:01.400
It's impossible!

08:02.200 --> 08:04.200
Surely he needs
the Pope's permission?

08:04.600 --> 08:08.200
But the Pope is still the
emperor's prisoner.

08:09.900 --> 08:11.300
Senor Mendoza...

08:11.600 --> 08:13.100
...for the love of our saviour,
Jesus Christ...

08:13.400 --> 08:14.700
...and the love of all that is sacred...

08:15.000 --> 08:18.300
...tell my nephew what is
being done to me here!

08:19.200 --> 08:20.600
Leave it to me.

08:21.200 --> 08:24.400
I will find a way to evade
the cardinal's spies.

08:49.300 --> 08:51.400
What are you thinking about?

08:53.700 --> 08:56.500
I wasn't thinking.

08:56.900 --> 08:58.600
I was listening.

08:59.700 --> 09:02.100
You working on something new?

09:05.300 --> 09:07.700
To work on something
I have to hear it.

09:14.600 --> 09:16.300
I love you.

09:18.200 --> 09:20.200
What about your wife?

09:22.200 --> 09:25.200
You know very well
she's not my wife.

09:25.800 --> 09:29.100
I never believed that love
should be bound by doctrine.

09:34.200 --> 09:35.900
I'm going away.

09:38.900 --> 09:40.800
You're going away? Why?

09:42.200 --> 09:44.800
Cardinal Wolsey is going to France.

09:46.400 --> 09:47.800
He invited me to go with him.

09:48.100 --> 09:50.000
With other musicians.

09:52.200 --> 09:53.800
Must you go?

09:54.700 --> 09:57.300
You know very well
that an invitation from a cardinal...

09:57.600 --> 09:59.600
...is like an invitation from a king.

09:59.900 --> 10:04.100
We little people must put our hands
into the fire if invited to.

10:06.900 --> 10:08.500
I'll miss you.

10:11.500 --> 10:13.000
No, you won't.

10:14.500 --> 10:17.400
You'll soon find other distractions.

10:30.600 --> 10:33.800
Tell me truthfully.
What are your hopes for this mission?

10:36.200 --> 10:37.800
I have many hopes.

10:39.100 --> 10:43.700
Firstly, to heal the wounds caused
by years of Anglo-French hostility.

10:44.900 --> 10:48.200
And then to work towards
a new balance of power in Europe.

10:48.500 --> 10:50.900
The sacking of Rome,
the imprisonment of the Pope...

10:51.200 --> 10:53.800
...these things have destabilized
the whole of Europe.

10:55.200 --> 10:56.800
And the Church?

10:58.100 --> 11:00.800
The Church is also
in need of mediation.

11:01.500 --> 11:05.100
At the conclave, we shall lay plans
for a general council which...

11:05.500 --> 11:07.200
...in the absence of the Pope...

11:07.500 --> 11:12.600
...will deal with pressing matters
of heresy and reform.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
And the king's matter?

11:17.200 --> 11:20.700
That will also be dealt with. But as
one of a number of other matters.

11:22.300 --> 11:25.500
Do you think the cardinals will
give you the authority to deal with it?

11:28.400 --> 11:33.100
- Yes.
- Then you will be de facto Pope.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.800
And since His Holiness
may never escape captivity...

11:37.200 --> 11:39.600
This is idle speculation.

11:43.800 --> 11:46.000
I have work to do, Sir Thomas.

12:10.300 --> 12:12.500
Why are you sitting in the darkness?

12:21.500 --> 12:22.700
What's wrong?

12:24.500 --> 12:27.600
- You don't understand.
- Of course I do.

12:28.500 --> 12:29.800
I'm your brother, aren't I?

12:30.700 --> 12:34.400
If only you were still
as you used to be.

12:34.800 --> 12:37.100
I remember I told you everything.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.500
All my secrets.

12:39.800 --> 12:42.400
- You can still tell me.
- I can't.

12:43.400 --> 12:44.700
Why?

12:45.600 --> 12:47.400
You'd share them.

13:33.800 --> 13:35.300
Your Majesty.

13:36.500 --> 13:41.600
We salute you, Cardinal Pacificus,
cardinal of peace.

13:53.600 --> 13:55.300
Eminence.

13:56.100 --> 14:00.700
Enchante, Madame.
As beautiful as ever, like the sun.

14:01.600 --> 14:03.900
You are very gracious,
Monsieur Cardinal.

14:06.200 --> 14:09.100
And we treat you as a brother,
for that is what you are.

14:09.600 --> 14:14.900
A true and loyal friend of France.
We welcome you...

14:15.800 --> 14:20.000
...and all those with you,
into our court and into our hearts.

14:27.500 --> 14:30.700
I am greatly honoured, Your Majesty.
And very touched.

14:31.700 --> 14:33.700
- This is nothing.
- Tallis.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.300
Mr. Wyatt.

14:35.500 --> 14:37.100
I've been thinking.

14:37.400 --> 14:40.200
Perhaps you would set
a poem of mine to music.

14:40.500 --> 14:42.700
I'd be honoured.
Do you have one ready?

14:43.000 --> 14:45.400
I'm working on one.
I have the first line.

14:45.800 --> 14:47.900
Then you have almost everything.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.300
Bonjour, Monsieur Cardinal.

14:56.700 --> 14:58.300
Bonjour, Your Grace.

14:58.600 --> 15:02.000
The Duke of Orleans is very glad
to be betrothed to Princess Mary.

15:02.300 --> 15:04.200
Very, very happy.

15:15.900 --> 15:17.300
Charming.

15:17.600 --> 15:20.000
You don't like the French much,
do you, Sir Thomas?

15:20.300 --> 15:22.100
I don't mind them, Mr. Wyatt.

15:23.000 --> 15:26.900
It's just that they're always
so very French.

15:43.400 --> 15:45.600
Were there any letters for me?

15:47.400 --> 15:49.400
No letters, madam.

16:00.300 --> 16:02.000
Lady Anne.

16:05.200 --> 16:07.100
Yes, Your Majesty.

16:08.500 --> 16:10.200
I know what you are doing.

16:13.900 --> 16:17.900
But do not think
to take the king away from me.

16:19.200 --> 16:23.100
Let him play with you.
Let him give you gifts.

16:25.100 --> 16:27.400
But he cannot give you
his true heart.

16:28.400 --> 16:32.100
For I have that in my keeping.

16:55.600 --> 16:57.400
Letters from His Eminence
Cardinal Wolsey.

17:03.300 --> 17:06.700
Your Majesty should know
that His Holiness Pope Clement...

17:07.000 --> 17:10.200
...has escaped Castel St. Angelo.

17:10.599 --> 17:12.099
He's escaped?

17:12.400 --> 17:14.400
Apparently, he dressed
as an old blind man...

17:14.800 --> 17:17.599
...and walked out past his captors.

17:18.700 --> 17:20.099
Where is he now?

17:20.400 --> 17:24.900
According to my information,
in an Italian town called Orvieto...

17:25.300 --> 17:27.800
...in the bishop's palace there,
with his court.

17:28.600 --> 17:31.700
Of course, he is still within
the power of the emperor.

17:32.100 --> 17:35.500
And yet he is free?

17:40.600 --> 17:42.600
It would be possible...

17:47.200 --> 17:49.800
It would be possible
to send someone to him?

17:50.100 --> 17:52.000
To give him a message?

17:52.700 --> 17:54.700
Indeed, it would be possible.

17:59.100 --> 18:01.900
How do you know all this?
From Wolsey?

18:02.300 --> 18:06.200
No, Your Majesty.
I have my own sources.

18:07.500 --> 18:10.300
Let us say I wanted a message
carried to His Holiness.

18:11.000 --> 18:14.700
Do you know someone? Someone
you could trust with your life?

18:16.500 --> 18:18.100
Dr. Knight. A man of God.

18:18.400 --> 18:21.500
A diplomat. And a true Englishman.

18:26.300 --> 18:27.800
Bring him to me.

19:02.500 --> 19:04.800
So that's how he does it.

19:23.900 --> 19:25.200
Call.

19:34.800 --> 19:36.300
My two queens win.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.500
I hate cards.

19:41.600 --> 19:43.700
I hate this court.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.300
I even hate time itself.

19:49.900 --> 19:51.700
Your Majesty,
might I make a suggestion?

19:52.000 --> 19:53.900
Anything.

19:54.200 --> 19:56.900
Forget the court.

19:57.800 --> 20:00.100
Let's go to the woods.
Let's go for a hunt.

20:00.500 --> 20:02.100
As we used to do.

20:03.800 --> 20:05.900
Yes, yes.

20:06.200 --> 20:07.900
But not Brandon.

20:09.500 --> 20:13.200
- Charles is your...
- I haven't forgiven my Lord Suffolk.

20:13.600 --> 20:15.600
I can't forgive him.

20:16.200 --> 20:18.700
He never asked permission
to marry my sister.

20:20.000 --> 20:24.300
It's insufferable arrogance.

20:24.600 --> 20:27.000
I mean, what did he expect?

20:29.500 --> 20:31.100
Look.

20:31.400 --> 20:34.200
I don't mean
that he's banished forever.

20:36.200 --> 20:37.900
Just as long as he breathes.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.600
Come on.

20:45.400 --> 20:46.800
You know what we should do?

20:47.100 --> 20:49.300
- What, sweetheart?
- Have a picnic.

20:49.600 --> 20:51.400
At Compton's place.

20:56.200 --> 20:58.400
Keep your eyes open.

20:58.700 --> 21:00.400
Walk them round.

21:09.700 --> 21:11.100
You see, William?

21:12.400 --> 21:14.200
Things can never be
as they used to be.

21:29.700 --> 21:31.400
Sir Thomas Boleyn, Your Grace.

21:37.300 --> 21:38.700
- My lord.
- Your Grace.

21:42.400 --> 21:45.300
- To what do I owe this pleasure?
- May I speak frankly?

22:01.100 --> 22:02.700
To your health, my lord.

22:03.800 --> 22:05.500
And yours.

22:09.200 --> 22:10.800
Norfolk has sent me.

22:11.600 --> 22:14.500
But Norfolk hates me.
I am a new man, after all.

22:14.900 --> 22:16.800
And he is far too grand for me.

22:17.100 --> 22:20.400
I suspect he despises us all
for the same reasons.

22:20.700 --> 22:23.300
And yet he has interests
to protect and further...

22:23.600 --> 22:25.100
...like the rest of us.

22:25.400 --> 22:27.700
He must deal with us
as he finds us.

22:28.000 --> 22:31.600
And, after all, there is
someone he hates even more.

22:32.800 --> 22:35.200
- The cardinal.
- Of course.

22:35.700 --> 22:37.100
But what is that to me?

22:39.400 --> 22:41.100
Do you miss the court, Your Grace?

22:43.000 --> 22:44.500
Perhaps you don't.

22:45.600 --> 22:47.400
Down here, in this green space...

22:47.700 --> 22:53.400
...you have so much leisure to enjoy.
So many idle pursuits.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.600
Yet I have heard it said by some...

22:55.800 --> 22:59.400
...that the king's presence
is like the sun.

23:00.800 --> 23:03.400
And when you are away from it...

23:04.800 --> 23:07.200
...there is only eternal night.

23:16.500 --> 23:18.100
You're a clever man, Boleyn.

23:18.500 --> 23:20.700
That is what people say.

23:21.500 --> 23:24.500
They say you are
charming and clever.

23:26.900 --> 23:28.600
What does Norfolk want?

23:36.000 --> 23:38.400
He wants you to help us
destroy Wolsey.

23:39.300 --> 23:42.000
And in return, he will persuade
the king to forgive you...

23:42.300 --> 23:44.200
...and welcome you back to court.

23:49.000 --> 23:50.500
Thank you, my lord.

24:10.600 --> 24:12.400
What did you hear?

24:12.700 --> 24:14.100
Everything.

24:19.900 --> 24:21.600
What will you do?

24:24.100 --> 24:25.800
What should I do?

24:31.500 --> 24:33.600
You once told me...

24:34.900 --> 24:37.600
...that sometimes Wolsey
had been kind to you.

24:42.100 --> 24:43.500
Did I?

24:44.200 --> 24:46.200
I had quite forgotten.

25:03.700 --> 25:05.400
It seems Our Majesty is in love.

25:05.800 --> 25:07.200
Sir.

25:30.000 --> 25:31.700
Poor Harry.

25:50.600 --> 25:52.000
Tallis?

25:53.000 --> 25:56.400
What is it?
Bloody poets never sleep.

25:56.800 --> 26:00.200
I've written the first few lines.
Can I read them to you?

26:03.300 --> 26:07.000
They flee from me
That sometime did me seek

26:07.400 --> 26:10.000
With nak ed foot
Stalking in my chamber

26:13.600 --> 26:16.800
I have seen them
Gentle, tame and weak

26:17.200 --> 26:22.700
That are now wild
And do not remember

26:23.100 --> 26:25.100
That sometime
They put themselves in danger

26:25.400 --> 26:29.200
To tak e bread at my hand

26:29.600 --> 26:31.800
And now they range

26:32.100 --> 26:36.400
Busily seeking
With a continual change

26:42.500 --> 26:46.000
- That's all there is so far.
- It's wonderful.

26:46.400 --> 26:47.600
There is music in it.

26:48.700 --> 26:51.200
What's it about?

26:51.500 --> 26:54.200
- A girl.
- What girl?

26:54.500 --> 26:56.400
Let's just call her the brunette.

27:03.000 --> 27:04.900
I loved her once.

27:06.200 --> 27:07.800
And I thought she loved me.

27:10.400 --> 27:12.100
But now she belongs to another?

27:14.000 --> 27:15.900
Quiet in here.

27:22.200 --> 27:27.000
She may be just a girl,
but I tell you this, Mr. Tallis...

27:27.400 --> 27:29.700
...if she gets her way...

27:30.000 --> 27:33.500
...she will set
our whole country in a roar.

27:43.100 --> 27:44.500
Thank you.

27:53.000 --> 27:54.300
His Majesty wants assurance...

27:54.600 --> 27:57.200
...that Your Eminence
has everything you desire.

28:04.400 --> 28:05.600
Forgive me.

28:05.800 --> 28:12.400
If I was younger, or more foolish,
or more alive...

28:14.800 --> 28:17.400
...I would gladly take this offer.

28:24.100 --> 28:27.900
You deserve better
than to be used as a whore.

28:45.700 --> 28:48.500
My lords and ladies, the queen.

28:53.900 --> 28:55.200
Your Majesty.

28:56.800 --> 28:59.700
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

29:02.200 --> 29:05.400
- Your Majesty.
- Your Grace.

29:06.700 --> 29:08.300
Your Grace.

29:09.500 --> 29:11.500
Your Majesty.

29:15.300 --> 29:17.500
- Lord Darby.
- My queen.

29:33.400 --> 29:35.400
I have something for you.

29:40.600 --> 29:42.100
You see.

29:42.400 --> 29:46.400
The falcon is your crest
and the pomegranate is hers.

29:48.900 --> 29:50.700
You still don't understand, do you?

29:51.700 --> 29:54.300
It's not a game, George.
It's dangerous.

30:00.200 --> 30:01.500
Mistress Boleyn.

30:03.300 --> 30:05.100
- Mr. Cromwell.
- I have some news.

30:05.800 --> 30:09.500
The king is dispatching a good man
to see the Pope about the divorce.

30:09.800 --> 30:11.800
A Dr. Knight.

30:12.100 --> 30:14.100
I know Dr. Knight. He was my tutor.

30:14.400 --> 30:17.600
Indeed. All things connect.

30:28.000 --> 30:29.500
Ladies.

30:30.100 --> 30:31.400
Sir.

30:32.200 --> 30:35.200
Would I be right to think you
are maids of honour to Her Majesty?

30:35.600 --> 30:36.800
Yes, sir.

30:37.000 --> 30:38.300
George Boleyn.

30:38.600 --> 30:40.900
You don't know me now
but one day you will.

30:44.000 --> 30:47.100
- We could be useful to each other.
- How so?

30:49.100 --> 30:51.700
You tell me who you're fucking...

30:52.100 --> 30:54.900
...and I'll tell you if it's a good idea.

30:55.500 --> 30:57.800
You understand?

30:58.100 --> 30:59.500
And in return?

31:01.700 --> 31:03.600
I'll think of something.

31:04.400 --> 31:08.300
It depends how hungry you are
to be rich and famous.

31:09.800 --> 31:11.500
It's something I can arrange.

31:12.600 --> 31:14.600
I'm a builder of fortunes.

31:18.100 --> 31:19.700
Here.

31:20.500 --> 31:22.600
We rely upon you, Dr. Knight...

31:22.900 --> 31:26.200
...to deliver these two bulls
to His Holiness, at Orvieto.

31:27.100 --> 31:28.900
They were written by our own hand.

31:31.300 --> 31:32.700
Majesty.

31:59.900 --> 32:01.500
It would be better for Europe...

32:02.300 --> 32:04.300
...if we now make peace
with the emperor.

32:08.000 --> 32:11.600
How can you say that?
He made me his prisoner.

32:11.900 --> 32:15.300
He squeezed my balls.
I had to pay him millions in ransom.

32:15.800 --> 32:17.800
And my eldest son is still his captive.

32:19.900 --> 32:22.900
How can I make peace
with that piece of shit?

32:32.900 --> 32:36.400
You must be gratified
by the progress you've made so far.

32:36.800 --> 32:38.200
It's something of a burden...

32:38.400 --> 32:40.800
...dragging my old body
from country to country.

32:41.800 --> 32:43.600
You'd rather be at home.

32:44.900 --> 32:48.100
I do fret, rather, that the king
will be influenced...

32:48.400 --> 32:50.200
...by others in my absence.

32:50.900 --> 32:54.100
After the conclave,
you need not fret.

32:55.500 --> 32:58.100
You'll soon have the power
to please him.

33:07.400 --> 33:09.000
Evening, my lord.

33:09.900 --> 33:11.400
Thank you.

33:21.400 --> 33:22.800
Boy.

33:25.800 --> 33:27.400
Boy.

33:30.700 --> 33:32.100
Damn you.

34:03.800 --> 34:05.300
The king.

34:14.400 --> 34:16.000
Sweet Anne.

34:21.600 --> 34:23.199
The queen.

34:28.100 --> 34:31.199
No, no. Wait.

34:34.000 --> 34:35.699
Only a moment.

34:37.699 --> 34:40.100
Tonight I dine
with your father and uncle.

34:42.100 --> 34:45.900
Your Majesty, my father says
it is all beyond his deserving.

34:46.300 --> 34:47.800
No.

34:48.600 --> 34:52.100
For when I am with them,
I am close to you.

34:56.699 --> 34:58.100
Here.

35:02.200 --> 35:04.600
Another token of my affection.

35:05.700 --> 35:08.800
Take it. From your humble servant.

35:19.700 --> 35:21.000
Your neck.

35:24.300 --> 35:25.800
I love your neck.

36:00.300 --> 36:03.300
My lords, let us drink...

36:03.600 --> 36:07.200
...to the resolution of the matter
which is uppermost in our minds.

36:07.600 --> 36:09.700
- Your Majesty.
- Majesty.

36:11.500 --> 36:14.600
In a very short while,
we shall have an answer.

36:15.700 --> 36:20.000
I would trust to hear it more
from Dr. Knight than Cardinal Wolsey.

36:21.800 --> 36:23.700
Why do you say?

36:24.000 --> 36:27.800
I fear it is not in the cardinal's
interest to succeed.

36:30.000 --> 36:33.300
But surely his interests and mine
are one and the same?

36:33.700 --> 36:35.100
He is my servant.

36:35.900 --> 36:37.600
His Grace means that the cardinal...

36:37.800 --> 36:40.500
...has some prejudice
against my daughter.

36:41.200 --> 36:43.100
I know. I know.

36:44.300 --> 36:46.700
He called her a silly girl.

36:47.600 --> 36:48.900
She told me.

36:51.800 --> 36:54.800
There is another matter.

36:55.100 --> 36:56.700
My lord did not want to tell you.

36:57.000 --> 37:01.000
But it is something I think Your Majesty
should be made aware of.

37:04.500 --> 37:06.000
Well?

37:07.800 --> 37:09.100
Majesty...

37:10.900 --> 37:12.800
...by your great bounty,
I was appointed...

37:13.100 --> 37:15.400
...comptroller
of Your Majesty's household.

37:15.700 --> 37:17.900
And in such a capacity...

37:19.200 --> 37:22.900
...I have discovered that when corrupt
religious houses are closed down...

37:23.300 --> 37:25.700
...instead of their assets
going to your exchequer...

37:26.000 --> 37:27.500
...as they should do...

37:29.300 --> 37:32.100
...they are often diverted elsewhere.

37:35.600 --> 37:36.900
Elsewhere?

37:38.900 --> 37:41.700
Into Wolsey's private foundations.

37:43.900 --> 37:45.900
Into the creation
of his college at Oxford.

37:54.400 --> 37:56.200
I must admit...

37:56.500 --> 37:58.900
...I find your intimations shocking.

37:59.600 --> 38:02.900
Indeed, I am hurt.

38:04.400 --> 38:07.200
Cardinal Wolsey
is not only my chancellor...

38:08.200 --> 38:11.300
...he has always been my friend.

38:13.700 --> 38:16.800
In this world, Majesty,
a true and loyal friend...

38:17.100 --> 38:19.000
...is the greatest boon
any man can have.

38:21.800 --> 38:26.100
For in everything else,
there is a strange habit of forsaking.

38:27.300 --> 38:30.600
That reminds me,
the Duke of Suffolk came to see me.

38:31.800 --> 38:33.300
- Brandon?
- He said...

38:34.400 --> 38:37.300
...he would crawl
on his hands and knees...

38:37.600 --> 38:39.400
...to beg Your Majesty's forgiveness.

39:02.800 --> 39:05.300
The necklace. Who gave it to you?

39:09.500 --> 39:11.000
Answer me.

39:14.200 --> 39:15.700
His Majesty.

39:20.000 --> 39:21.300
You are expensive, huh?

39:22.100 --> 39:23.400
An expensive whore!

39:23.800 --> 39:25.200
I am no whore...

39:27.300 --> 39:29.000
...Your Majesty.

39:31.100 --> 39:34.100
I love His Majesty.
I believe he loves me.

39:37.400 --> 39:41.900
He is infatuated by you,
as men often are by new things.

39:43.600 --> 39:46.600
Soon he will see you
for what you really are.

39:47.000 --> 39:49.800
And he will tire of you...

39:50.100 --> 39:52.800
...as all the others.

39:57.400 --> 39:58.800
And what if he does not?

39:59.100 --> 40:02.100
I did not give you permission
to speak.

40:02.400 --> 40:05.000
You are a servant.

40:05.900 --> 40:07.600
Go now.

40:09.500 --> 40:10.900
Go.

40:44.800 --> 40:46.800
- Who are you?
- Dr. Knight, forgive us, sir.

40:47.000 --> 40:49.200
We must just ask you
to break off your journey.

40:49.500 --> 40:51.700
Impossible.
I am on the king's business.

40:52.100 --> 40:55.000
Yes, sir, we know that.
That is why you must come with us.

41:01.200 --> 41:03.400
Dr. Knight, come in.

41:05.900 --> 41:08.300
- Your Eminence...
- I make it my business...

41:08.600 --> 41:11.000
...to know the king's business.

41:11.300 --> 41:15.400
Did you really think you could go to
Orvieto without my knowing about it?

41:17.300 --> 41:21.200
Now, you've been sent
by the king to the Pope...

41:21.600 --> 41:24.100
...with these two bulls, is that correct?

41:24.400 --> 41:26.100
Yes.

41:26.900 --> 41:30.300
These are extraordinary documents.
Do you know what's in them?

41:30.600 --> 41:34.300
- Yes, a little.
- And you still agreed to carry them?

41:38.300 --> 41:43.000
The first document asks the Pope
to permit him, once divorced...

41:43.500 --> 41:45.100
...to marry any woman he chooses...

41:45.300 --> 41:47.400
...even one who would
be forbidden to him...

41:47.700 --> 41:50.700
...because of a prior relationship
to one of her relatives.

41:51.100 --> 41:53.100
I don't understand that.
The king wrote this.

41:53.400 --> 41:56.500
- What woman is he referring to?
- Mistress Anne Boleyn.

41:59.100 --> 42:00.600
Anne Boleyn?

42:03.400 --> 42:05.400
The king loves Anne Boleyn?

42:06.200 --> 42:07.400
Yes, sir.

42:11.700 --> 42:15.000
And what is this prior relationship
he refers to?

42:17.800 --> 42:20.800
Surely Your Eminence is aware
that His Majesty...

42:21.100 --> 42:24.500
...had carnal relations
with Anne's older sister, Mary.

42:26.100 --> 42:28.600
Perhaps even with their mother.

42:28.900 --> 42:32.600
So it is rumoured.
I give it no credence.

42:33.000 --> 42:34.700
With regard to the mother.

42:37.000 --> 42:39.200
And the second document.
Have you read it?

42:40.200 --> 42:43.200
- No, sir.
- Just as well.

42:43.500 --> 42:44.900
I wouldn't like to be the man...

42:45.200 --> 42:48.000
...that has to present this
to the descendant of Saint Peter.

42:48.400 --> 42:53.500
It asks this: " If no way can be found
to nullify the king's marriage...

42:53.900 --> 42:56.700
...then the Pope should
allow him to take a second wife."

42:57.900 --> 43:01.000
Do you understand? He's asking
the Pope to sanction bigamy.

43:08.900 --> 43:12.300
Since the king commands it,
you must be on your way, Dr. Knight.

43:12.600 --> 43:16.500
But with no hope of success,
or honour.

43:30.700 --> 43:33.400
I heard you crawled here like a dog.

43:35.300 --> 43:37.500
- Something like...
- Hold your tongue.

43:38.900 --> 43:40.900
You were always too useful with it.

43:42.000 --> 43:43.600
Yes, Your Majesty.

43:44.100 --> 43:46.400
Have you come
to beg my forgiveness?

43:46.700 --> 43:48.500
Yes, Your Majesty.

43:51.600 --> 43:53.400
Well, then beg for it.

44:03.500 --> 44:07.400
With all my heart. With all my soul.

44:07.800 --> 44:09.600
With every ounce of my being.

44:09.900 --> 44:12.100
My king, my sovereign,
my dread lord...

44:12.400 --> 44:15.000
...I beg you to forgive
your miserable servant...

44:16.200 --> 44:19.000
...your humble, worthless,
thoughtless servant...

44:19.300 --> 44:21.200
...who deserves so little...

44:21.500 --> 44:23.800
...and by your bounty
and your grace...

44:24.100 --> 44:25.600
...was given so much.

44:26.900 --> 44:28.700
Ungrateful wretch that I am.

44:29.900 --> 44:32.200
Unworthy of Your Majesty's love.

44:40.900 --> 44:42.400
Come here.

45:09.000 --> 45:10.500
If you can beat me...

45:11.700 --> 45:13.800
...you can come back to court.

45:15.400 --> 45:16.900
Ready?

46:32.700 --> 46:34.500
Welcome back.

46:56.400 --> 46:59.100
- What was I supposed to do?
- I don't know.

46:59.400 --> 47:02.500
But I agree with you.
It was crude and unacceptable.

47:02.800 --> 47:06.600
- I'm disappointed in His Majesty.
- Thomas, I have to ask you this.

47:07.500 --> 47:10.900
Will you accept the judgement
of the cardinals?

47:11.300 --> 47:12.900
What does it matter now?

47:13.200 --> 47:14.800
The Pope is free.

47:15.000 --> 47:18.400
- There is no need for a conclave.
- No, there is more need than ever.

47:18.800 --> 47:20.900
The Pope is still
in the power of the emperor...

47:21.200 --> 47:23.700
...unable to exercise any control
over the Church.

47:24.000 --> 47:27.400
So someone else must do so
and I ask you again...

47:28.900 --> 47:31.700
...will you accept
the judgement of the cardinals?

47:34.100 --> 47:38.300
More, if you are not for me now,
then you are against me.

47:39.400 --> 47:40.700
Stakes have grown higher.

47:41.000 --> 47:44.600
Mr. Cromwell tells me that the king
now dines with Norfolk and Boleyn.

47:45.000 --> 47:48.600
They are my bitter enemies.
They constantly seek my downfall.

47:48.900 --> 47:51.500
And if you do not help me,
then you help them.

47:52.800 --> 47:55.200
Need I remind you of this?

47:55.500 --> 47:59.800
You owe all your advancement
in this world to me.

48:04.600 --> 48:07.500
Thomas, we've known each other
a long time.

48:07.900 --> 48:10.900
I know you've often complained
about my methods, my way of dealing.

48:11.300 --> 48:15.500
But underneath all of that,
I believe we still share many things.

48:15.800 --> 48:18.800
We're still humanists, even though
the world batters our beliefs...

48:19.200 --> 48:21.600
...and compromises our actions.

48:21.900 --> 48:25.600
Nothing, no earthly thing,
not even a prince...

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
...will ever compromise mine.

48:29.800 --> 48:31.400
Oh, I see.

48:31.700 --> 48:34.100
You don't want to get
your hands dirty. I understand.

48:36.400 --> 48:38.700
Well, unfortunately,
you don't have a choice.

48:39.000 --> 48:43.200
The dyer's hand is always stained
by the elements he works with.

48:51.600 --> 48:53.100
Here is my element.

48:54.800 --> 48:56.900
The spiritual element.

48:58.200 --> 48:59.400
The higher element.

49:01.300 --> 49:02.800
Now you tell me...

49:05.500 --> 49:07.600
...am I stained by it?

49:18.700 --> 49:21.900
Let me know the moment
the cardinals arrive.

50:30.700 --> 50:32.400
Mon cher Wolsey.

50:34.300 --> 50:35.900
I expect you heard.

50:37.000 --> 50:38.400
The cardinals are not coming.

50:42.000 --> 50:43.700
There's nothing I can do about it.

50:44.000 --> 50:46.400
They only take orders
from His Holiness.

50:57.900 --> 51:01.300
The wheel turns, my friend.

51:05.300 --> 51:09.000
They flee from me
That sometime did me seek

51:09.400 --> 51:13.700
With nak ed foot stalking
In my chamber

51:16.000 --> 51:18.200
Thanks be to fortune,
It has been otherwise

51:18.500 --> 51:24.700
Twenty times better
But once in special

51:26.700 --> 51:30.400
In thin array, after a pleasant guise

51:31.100 --> 51:35.100
When her loose gown
From her shoulders did fall

51:35.500 --> 51:39.000
And she caught me
In her arms long and small

51:39.400 --> 51:42.000
There with all sweetly did we kiss

51:42.300 --> 51:48.900
And softly said,
"Dear Heart, how like you this?"

52:17.300 --> 52:19.100
Out. Out.

52:20.300 --> 52:22.500
Your Eminence,
your blessing on my daughter?

52:22.800 --> 52:25.100
- Blessings, my child.
- Thank you, Your Eminence.

52:25.800 --> 52:28.600
- Your Eminence, please, a moment.
- No, no.

52:32.000 --> 52:33.900
- Now, Mr. Cromwell.
- Your Eminence.

52:34.200 --> 52:37.000
- The king awaits you, but...
- What?

52:37.400 --> 52:39.300
He is not alone.

52:49.600 --> 52:51.100
Majesty.

52:51.300 --> 52:52.700
Well?

52:57.000 --> 52:59.600
Majesty, I was hoping that...

52:59.900 --> 53:02.200
You can speak freely
in front of Mistress Boleyn.

53:02.900 --> 53:04.500
She knows everything.

53:10.600 --> 53:13.900
So. You've come back from Paris.

53:14.300 --> 53:16.700
- Yes.
- Tell us of your triumphs.

53:17.400 --> 53:19.400
Tell us all your news.

53:21.300 --> 53:23.600
We are so eager to hear.

53:27.000 --> 53:28.800
Oh, for the love of God, man.

53:31.300 --> 53:33.100
Do I have my divorce?

53:41.000 --> 53:46.300
Your Majesty will recall
that I went to Paris...

53:46.700 --> 53:48.600
It was no dream.

53:48.900 --> 53:51.600
I lay broad waking

53:51.900 --> 53:55.200
But all is turned
Through my gentleness

53:55.600 --> 53:59.100
Into a strange fashion
Of forsaking

54:00.700 --> 54:02.500
And I have leave to go
Of her goodness

54:05.200 --> 54:09.500
But since that
I so kindly am served

54:09.900 --> 54:14.000
I'd like to know
what she has deserved

54:15.305 --> 54:21.705
