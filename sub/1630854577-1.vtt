WEBVTT

00:20.478 --> 00:21.938
Whoa! Uhh... uhh...

00:22.022 --> 00:23.523
Sorry, Big! Sorry, Froggy!

00:23.606 --> 00:25.775
Can’t chat--
gotta go help our friends!

00:25.859 --> 00:28.653
-No problem, Sonic!
-Ribbit!

00:28.737 --> 00:30.655
<i>Home is</i>
<i>where your friends are,</i>

00:30.739 --> 00:32.490
<i>as they say,</i>

00:32.574 --> 00:34.534
<i>and that’s Green Hill,</i>

00:34.617 --> 00:37.579
<i>where the best beaches,</i>
<i>palm trees, and chili dogs</i>

00:37.662 --> 00:40.165
<i>are just the tip</i>
<i>of the iceberg.</i>

00:40.248 --> 00:42.167
<i>We’ve saved this place</i>
<i>a million times</i>

00:42.250 --> 00:44.169
<i>from this doofus.</i>

00:46.463 --> 00:48.590
<i>And then there’s Shadow.</i>

00:48.673 --> 00:51.050
<i>It’s complicated.</i>
<i>More on him later.</i>

00:51.134 --> 00:53.845
<i>The fact is, we never lose.</i>

00:55.054 --> 00:57.182
<i>’Cause when you’ve got</i>
<i>a crew like mine,</i>

00:57.265 --> 00:59.267
<i>there’s nothing</i>
<i>that can stop you!</i>

01:00.685 --> 01:03.104
Hey, guys! I made it!

01:03.188 --> 01:04.939
You’re late!

01:05.023 --> 01:06.524
Sonic!

01:06.608 --> 01:08.026
Eggman!

01:08.109 --> 01:11.279
Just in time to watch me
claim the Paradox Prism

01:11.362 --> 01:13.990
and transform your
disgustingly green world

01:14.074 --> 01:17.285
into something more... me.

01:19.120 --> 01:21.831
Yawn!

01:21.915 --> 01:24.000
Yep, I "yawned" you, Eggman.

01:24.084 --> 01:26.836
Crush them all!

01:38.973 --> 01:40.058
Whoa!

01:40.141 --> 01:42.435
-Sonic!
-Yo, Tails!

01:44.521 --> 01:47.023
Knuckles! You okay, buddy?

01:47.106 --> 01:50.527
Nothing flusters me, Sonic...

01:50.610 --> 01:52.737
except when you’re late.

01:54.948 --> 01:56.032
Hiyah!

01:57.367 --> 01:58.535
Thanks, Rouge!

01:58.618 --> 02:00.328
Don’t mention it.
Literally.

02:05.375 --> 02:06.501
Amy!

02:06.584 --> 02:08.044
Sonic!
Where have you been?

02:08.128 --> 02:09.420
Got a little sidetracked.

02:15.802 --> 02:19.055
Get that rock
out of the ground!

02:24.269 --> 02:26.771
Want something done,
do it yourself.

02:28.314 --> 02:30.024
Sonic, we don’t know
what the Prism

02:30.108 --> 02:32.193
is capable of.
Be careful.

02:32.277 --> 02:34.779
If Eggman wants it,
it can’t be good.

02:34.863 --> 02:35.738
Got it!

02:38.324 --> 02:40.160
Step away from the rock, Eggman.

02:40.243 --> 02:42.328
Not this time, you fool.

02:52.005 --> 02:53.298
Sonic, wait!

02:55.466 --> 02:57.260
Sonic, no!

03:34.088 --> 03:36.049
One day I’ll destroy
that hedgehog,

03:36.132 --> 03:38.843
and the world will be
a brighter place for it,

03:38.927 --> 03:41.262
lit by neon.

03:41.346 --> 03:44.557
As long as I’m around,
you’ll always have a wingman!

03:44.641 --> 03:47.477
The forest is the most
beautiful place on earth.

03:47.560 --> 03:50.647
I don’t need the details,
just tell me who to smash.

03:50.730 --> 03:52.899
You may not like
the way I do things,

03:52.982 --> 03:54.692
but I get things done!

03:54.776 --> 03:57.695
Hey, I may be the one
who can bring everyone together,

03:57.779 --> 04:01.282
but there’s only one hedgehog
they’ll follow into battle.

04:01.366 --> 04:03.826
Heh heh!
I don’t need an army

04:03.910 --> 04:07.038
when I’ve got a friend like you,
Sonic.

04:07.121 --> 04:09.165
<i>I will rule the world,</i>

04:09.249 --> 04:11.960
<i>and no rodents</i>
<i>are going to stop me.</i>

04:12.043 --> 04:14.295
<i>We’d follow you</i>
<i>anywhere, Sonic.</i>

04:15.672 --> 04:17.882
<i>Nothing could</i>
<i>break our friendship, Sonic.</i>

04:32.188 --> 04:34.607
That’s a sonic boom
of a headache.

04:36.901 --> 04:39.904
Wh-where am I? Huh?

04:39.988 --> 04:42.031
Aah!

04:50.039 --> 04:51.124
Uh...

04:53.042 --> 04:56.004
Aah! Close one.

04:56.087 --> 04:57.088
Aah!

05:00.967 --> 05:02.552
Ow!

05:03.845 --> 05:04.929
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

05:07.432 --> 05:09.726
Why can’t I remember
how I got here?

05:09.809 --> 05:11.436
Think, Sonic, think!

05:11.519 --> 05:15.023
Whoa, what is up with my shoes?

05:15.106 --> 05:17.025
Huh. I haven’t seen
anything like this

05:17.108 --> 05:19.861
since I ate
truck stop chili dogs.

05:19.944 --> 05:21.821
Tails? Amy?

05:21.904 --> 05:24.824
Heck, I’ll even take Knuckles
at this point.

05:24.907 --> 05:28.619
Uh, pardon me,
what do you call this place?

05:28.703 --> 05:30.830
Are you ignoring me?
You’re ignoring me.

05:30.913 --> 05:32.332
Why are you ignoring me?

05:32.415 --> 05:34.083
Why is <i>everyone </i>ignoring me?

05:36.627 --> 05:39.255
Can anybody give me
a straight answer around here?

05:39.339 --> 05:42.300
And you’re busy
staring at nothing. Okay.

05:43.468 --> 05:44.469
Huh?

05:44.552 --> 05:47.096
"Welcome to New Yoke City.

05:47.180 --> 05:48.765
You’re welcome."

05:48.848 --> 05:51.976
Never heard of it.
Has to be far from home.

05:52.060 --> 05:55.521
Where are the mountains,
the beaches, the palm trees?

05:57.023 --> 05:58.691
Big! Froggy!

05:58.775 --> 06:00.151
Whoa! Uh...!

06:00.234 --> 06:02.695
Am I glad to see
familiar faces!

06:02.779 --> 06:05.406
I thought I was losing my rings,
you know what I mean?

06:05.490 --> 06:09.077
What is going on here?
Are you wearing pants?

06:09.160 --> 06:11.245
<i>Unidentified citizen.</i>

06:11.329 --> 06:12.663
<i>Alert! Alert!</i>

06:14.499 --> 06:16.542
Big! Don’t go!

06:19.837 --> 06:23.841
<i>You are in violation</i>
<i>of city ordinance 27 B/6.</i>

06:23.925 --> 06:26.385
Sorry, I don’t speak robot.

06:26.469 --> 06:29.097
By the authority
of the Chaos Council,

06:29.180 --> 06:31.474
stand down or be disassembled.

06:31.557 --> 06:33.976
Chaos Council. Sounds important.

06:34.060 --> 06:35.937
Give me directions,
and I’ll take it from there.

06:36.020 --> 06:38.272
Wha--? Whoaaaaaaaaaaaa!

06:45.988 --> 06:47.740
Whoa! What’s up with my shoes?

06:50.201 --> 06:52.328
Ugh! I’m not used
to all these walls.

06:52.411 --> 06:54.163
And where are my rings?

07:00.670 --> 07:03.297
Robots without Flickies?
Now, that’s new.

07:07.802 --> 07:09.303
Whoa!

07:10.763 --> 07:12.723
Wha--! Whaah!

07:12.807 --> 07:15.017
No, no, no, no, no, no!

07:22.191 --> 07:24.861
This is not working.
I gotta get off the ground!

07:31.701 --> 07:33.578
Whoa! Aah!

07:52.430 --> 07:53.473
Uhh...!

08:04.817 --> 08:07.445
<i>Smog, concrete, evil robots.</i>

08:07.528 --> 08:10.198
<i>It’s like everything</i>
<i>I hate all in one place!</i>

08:12.366 --> 08:13.868
Where am I?

08:13.951 --> 08:16.621
Oh, no!

08:22.376 --> 08:24.212
Please be wrong.
Please be wrong!

08:32.512 --> 08:33.763
The Loop-de-Loop...

08:35.473 --> 08:36.599
Hedgehog’s Pass...

08:39.101 --> 08:40.811
and that should be Tails’ lab!

08:42.980 --> 08:45.775
Aw, Tails, what happened?

08:53.741 --> 08:56.702
Come on, Egghead,
show me what you got!

08:58.746 --> 09:02.875
<i>That’s the spirit, rodent--</i>
<i>the spirit of a loser!</i>

09:04.043 --> 09:07.004
Takes one to know one. Ha!

09:07.088 --> 09:10.883
Why do I feel like Eggman’s
keeping us off the main stage?

09:10.967 --> 09:12.677
Eggman’s got us
fighting the badniks

09:12.760 --> 09:15.054
so he can have
Sonic all to himself.

09:15.137 --> 09:17.265
Let’s go crash his show!

09:24.313 --> 09:26.148
One scrambled egg, coming up.

09:31.821 --> 09:34.615
Hmm. I don’t like this.

09:34.699 --> 09:36.951
Dr. Eggman’s too smart
not to realize

09:37.034 --> 09:39.161
how terribly positioned he is.

09:39.245 --> 09:41.080
It’s almost like he’s--

09:41.163 --> 09:42.373
He’s not in there.

09:42.456 --> 09:44.250
<i>Quaking in your tiny shoes</i>

09:44.333 --> 09:46.252
<i>at the might</i>
<i>of my Eggcrusher?</i>

09:46.335 --> 09:49.589
<i>It’s understandable.</i>
<i>I’m rather astounding.</i>

09:49.672 --> 09:50.965
In your dreams!

09:51.048 --> 09:53.009
You bring it,
I break it, Eggman.

09:53.092 --> 09:56.470
That’s the game, and I’m still
the undefeated <i>numero uno</i>.

09:56.554 --> 09:58.889
Then put your quills
where your mouth is,

09:58.973 --> 10:00.850
unless you’re scared!

10:05.896 --> 10:08.774
It’s a trap, Sonic!
It’s a trap!

10:08.858 --> 10:10.901
I don’t see a trap,
though I guess by definition

10:10.985 --> 10:12.486
I wouldn’t see a trap
if there was one.

10:13.988 --> 10:15.740
Something funny, egghead?

10:15.823 --> 10:18.117
<i>You are!</i>
<i>Watching you try to think</i>

10:18.200 --> 10:22.788
<i>with that two-cent brain</i>
<i>of yours is hilarious!</i>

10:22.872 --> 10:26.292
Sonic! You gotta listen!
It’s a trap!

10:33.424 --> 10:35.926
<i>You’re as stupid</i>
<i>as your mutant,</i>

10:36.010 --> 10:38.888
<i>two-tailed fox friend</i>
<i>is ugly.</i>

10:38.971 --> 10:41.599
Oh, you’re really
asking for it.

10:41.682 --> 10:43.934
<i>Yes... I am!</i>

10:44.018 --> 10:45.686
You can mess with me, Eggman,

10:45.770 --> 10:48.397
but no one messes
with my best friend.

10:48.481 --> 10:50.232
Sonic! No!

11:09.919 --> 11:11.212
Ohh!

11:26.227 --> 11:28.521
Whoa! Didn’t know
I had that in me.

11:29.480 --> 11:32.441
That’s what you get for messing
with my friends, Egghead!

11:33.984 --> 11:36.821
Huh? Wh-where’s Eggman?

11:36.904 --> 11:38.823
He must have ejected.

11:41.450 --> 11:44.120
Well, looks like we win again.

11:44.203 --> 11:47.706
Tails! He’s not even in here.
Lame, right?

11:47.790 --> 11:51.210
Too chicken
to face us in person. Whatevs!

11:51.293 --> 11:52.837
Couldn’t have done it
without ya, buddy!

11:56.298 --> 11:58.050
Huh.

11:58.134 --> 12:00.428
Whoa, Tails looks upset.

12:00.511 --> 12:02.888
And Tails never gets upset.

12:05.266 --> 12:08.185
It worked!

12:08.269 --> 12:10.229
Without the power of that
blue buffoon,

12:10.312 --> 12:12.189
we would have
had to dig for months.

12:12.273 --> 12:14.859
Thank you for the earthquake,
Sonic,

12:14.942 --> 12:20.364
and thank me for my plan,
which went off spectacularly.

12:20.448 --> 12:21.949
And it worked, too!

12:22.032 --> 12:24.243
Of course it worked!
I just said that!

12:24.326 --> 12:28.122
Ugh, let’s go.
Papa wants his Prism.

12:44.013 --> 12:46.515
Yo! How’s my genius friend?

12:46.599 --> 12:48.017
Hey, Sonic.

12:48.100 --> 12:49.852
I brought you some comics.

12:49.935 --> 12:52.563
Thanks, Sonic,
you can put them over there.

12:52.646 --> 12:56.108
How about a little
break from the big brain stuff?

12:56.192 --> 12:58.444
I can’t.
Something’s not right.

12:58.527 --> 13:01.071
I gotta figure out
what Eggman is up to.

13:06.535 --> 13:09.455
Sorry, Tails.
I didn’t mean to upset you.

13:09.538 --> 13:12.249
In fact, I’ve never
seen you so upset.

13:12.333 --> 13:15.461
I just kinda
got into the moment and...

13:15.544 --> 13:18.172
Sonic, it’s cool. Really.

13:18.255 --> 13:20.549
But thanks. I appreciate it.

13:22.301 --> 13:23.719
Don’t you think it was weird

13:23.802 --> 13:25.638
that Eggman
wasn’t in the Eggcrusher?

13:25.721 --> 13:28.724
Uh, not really.
I mean, he is a total chicken.

13:28.807 --> 13:31.435
But I did find a hunk of junk
in the cockpit

13:31.519 --> 13:33.270
where his big butt shoulda been.

13:33.354 --> 13:34.939
Hunk of junk, huh?

13:35.022 --> 13:37.733
Wonder if that was
all part of the trap?

13:37.816 --> 13:40.236
Tell me you didn’t toss it
in the barge of badnik parts.

13:40.319 --> 13:41.779
Uh...

13:42.488 --> 13:44.907
Junk speedy delivery!
You smash it, we dash it!

13:44.990 --> 13:46.742
Whoa, lemme see that!

13:46.825 --> 13:49.995
It wasn’t a trap,
it was a trick.

13:50.079 --> 13:53.541
You’ve never created
a blast that destructive.

13:53.624 --> 13:56.210
<i>I think that this device was</i>
<i>some sort of speed amplifier.</i>

13:56.293 --> 13:59.964
<i>Long story short, he used</i>
<i>your speed against you!</i>

14:01.298 --> 14:03.509
-The fox is on to something.
-Huh?

14:03.592 --> 14:04.802
Rouge?

14:04.885 --> 14:06.053
How did you get in here?

14:06.136 --> 14:08.264
He played you for a fool, Blue.

14:08.347 --> 14:10.099
Pfft! Please!

14:10.182 --> 14:12.893
What would he need a massive
explosion in that area for?

14:12.977 --> 14:14.478
Well... I have a hunch.

14:16.564 --> 14:18.732
You see,
I’ve been searching for years

14:18.816 --> 14:22.820
for a super rare and shiny gem
called the Paradox Prism.

14:22.903 --> 14:24.113
Paradox Prism?

14:24.196 --> 14:26.949
Legend speaks of untold power,

14:27.032 --> 14:29.702
and it’s buried deep
within the Green Hill bedrock.

14:29.785 --> 14:32.121
My guess is that he used
your power against you

14:32.204 --> 14:33.414
to try to find it.

14:33.497 --> 14:35.791
Fascinating.

14:35.875 --> 14:39.920
But what I really want to know
is, how did you get in here?

14:40.880 --> 14:42.381
You left the door open.

14:44.800 --> 14:47.511
Gather your crew and meet me
at the top of the loop-de-loop.

14:47.595 --> 14:50.097
Let’s find out
what Eggman is up to.

14:58.898 --> 15:02.026
At last.
The Paradox Prism!

15:02.109 --> 15:05.613
So close. It was
only a rumor for so long,

15:05.696 --> 15:08.741
and now inches from my grasp.

15:08.824 --> 15:12.828
Countless times I have tried
to modernize this hunk of earth

15:12.912 --> 15:17.750
only to be defied
by that simpleton Sonic.

15:17.833 --> 15:20.753
Now, it’s finally
going to happen.

15:20.836 --> 15:22.671
And it’s all the sweeter

15:22.755 --> 15:26.383
because the blue baboon
handed me this prize...

15:27.551 --> 15:30.095
without realizing it.

15:30.179 --> 15:32.598
So, thank you, Sonic.

15:32.681 --> 15:36.060
For now, I stand
at the summit of--

15:36.143 --> 15:37.186
Of the mountain.

15:37.269 --> 15:40.814
...of a new age!
The age of--

15:40.898 --> 15:41.899
Pretty lights?

15:41.982 --> 15:46.612
...the age of the Eggman Empire!

15:46.695 --> 15:48.781
Ooh! Fancy.

15:50.950 --> 15:51.951
And now...

15:52.034 --> 15:53.452
Ahhhh!

16:00.042 --> 16:03.754
Why didn’t you idiots tell me
how big that first step was?

16:03.837 --> 16:05.673
Sorry, Boss.

16:15.391 --> 16:17.309
Where is it?

16:17.393 --> 16:20.312
I know you’re here somewhere.

16:55.764 --> 16:57.808
I think Rouge is right.

16:57.891 --> 17:00.019
Eggman picked
that spot for a reason.

17:00.102 --> 17:01.687
Why else would he
hide a power amplifier

17:01.770 --> 17:03.188
in his own egg crusher?

17:03.272 --> 17:05.816
So we start
at the scene of the crime.

17:05.899 --> 17:09.445
Exactly. Let’s go investigate
and see if anything

17:09.528 --> 17:11.530
might lead us to
this Paradox Prism

17:11.613 --> 17:12.990
you guys
are talking about.

17:13.073 --> 17:15.826
Paradox Prism. Right.

17:15.909 --> 17:17.703
That’s what Eggman was after.

17:17.786 --> 17:19.163
How?

17:22.916 --> 17:26.211
No, no, no.
I didn’t leave Green Hill.

17:26.295 --> 17:28.756
This <i>is </i>Green Hill.

17:30.007 --> 17:31.717
He did it.

17:31.800 --> 17:34.970
I don’t know how he did it,
but he did it.

17:35.054 --> 17:37.556
Eggman won.

17:39.975 --> 17:43.020
That would mean... badniks.

17:43.103 --> 17:44.063
I gotta find Tails!

17:50.652 --> 17:52.196
<i>Badniks.</i>

17:52.279 --> 17:53.489
<i>I gotta find Tails.</i>

17:54.573 --> 17:56.742
Who are you?

17:56.825 --> 17:59.244
More ungrateful rebels.

17:59.328 --> 18:03.499
No. Something new.
Not in the databanks.

18:03.582 --> 18:06.919
Its energy profile is...
intriguing.

18:07.002 --> 18:09.004
The Unidentified
Running Organism

18:09.088 --> 18:10.714
has outrun the Eggforcers

18:10.798 --> 18:13.717
and is heading
towards Babble’s area.

18:22.518 --> 18:24.394
Finding Tails
would be a lot easier

18:24.478 --> 18:26.772
if everything was covered
in grass and palm trees,

18:26.855 --> 18:28.023
like it should be.

18:29.858 --> 18:30.818
Whoa!

18:35.906 --> 18:38.909
Eggman, finally!
I don’t know what you did,

18:38.992 --> 18:42.121
and I don’t know how you did it,
but I’m gonna kick your Ro-butt!

18:50.879 --> 18:54.216
What is that, a baby rattle?
Not exactly scary--

19:04.518 --> 19:06.770
Whoa! Come on, shoes!

19:07.980 --> 19:09.356
Ha ha!

19:13.527 --> 19:14.778
Ow!

19:42.306 --> 19:43.891
Whoa! Unh!

19:48.478 --> 19:50.105
Okay, Eggy,

19:50.189 --> 19:52.608
you tell me what you did
and how to fix it!

20:01.158 --> 20:03.410
Whoa! You really are a baby.

20:03.493 --> 20:05.454
What in the name
of Green Hill’s going on?

20:21.053 --> 20:23.764
Ugh! Sorry, kid,
I don’t bust up babies.

20:27.809 --> 20:30.562
Go home, change your diaper,
think about your choices,

20:30.646 --> 20:33.023
and tell Eggman
I’ll deal with him later.

20:33.106 --> 20:35.776
Right now,
I got a fox friend to find!

20:48.872 --> 20:51.959
He’s fast, powerful,
and hates the egg.

20:52.042 --> 20:53.752
We gotta follow this guy.

20:53.835 --> 20:56.338
I don’t know, Rebel.
What if we follow him

20:56.421 --> 20:58.548
right into the hands
of the Chaos Council?

20:58.632 --> 21:00.550
Feels like a trap.

21:00.634 --> 21:02.511
When have I ever
steered us wrong?

21:03.637 --> 21:04.972
Rhetorical question.

21:09.393 --> 21:12.354
<i>Departing</i>
<i>trainsport from Circle Station</i>

21:12.437 --> 21:15.482
<i>arriving in the scareport...</i>

21:15.565 --> 21:18.402
Oh, man, I could really use
a familiar face

21:18.485 --> 21:19.695
right about now.

21:22.406 --> 21:23.991
Tails? Buddy?

21:29.955 --> 21:33.166
Tails! Tails!

21:35.752 --> 21:37.254
Wait, what?

21:37.337 --> 21:40.257
Hmm.

21:47.973 --> 21:51.768
Huh! I knew
you were here somewhere.

21:51.852 --> 21:53.270
Please be the same.

21:53.353 --> 21:55.814
Mmm...

21:57.524 --> 21:59.818
Tails, you crafty fox.

22:01.194 --> 22:03.322
Finally something
around here makes sense.

22:04.489 --> 22:06.033
Weird.

22:06.116 --> 22:08.827
Nothing about this
is like Tails’ workshop.

22:11.621 --> 22:14.791
Yes! There’s my
two-tailed genius friend.

22:14.875 --> 22:16.543
Surprise!

22:18.337 --> 22:20.922
Tails! It’s me, your best, uh...

22:21.006 --> 22:23.050
What did you just call me?

22:25.177 --> 22:26.803
Uh... Tails?

22:26.887 --> 22:28.430
The name’s...

22:28.513 --> 22:29.473
Nine!

22:29.556 --> 22:31.600
Wahh! Ahh!

22:35.020 --> 22:36.229
What do you want?

22:37.898 --> 22:39.608
Who sent you?

22:44.321 --> 22:46.156
Whoa! Heck!

22:46.239 --> 22:48.116
How many tails do you have?

22:48.200 --> 22:49.242
Nine!

22:55.540 --> 22:57.292
Ahh!

22:57.375 --> 22:58.668
Ahh!

23:04.674 --> 23:05.801
Tails, stop!

23:05.884 --> 23:08.220
We’re buds! Amigos!

23:09.679 --> 23:10.555
Best friends!

23:11.890 --> 23:13.600
I have no friends!

23:15.977 --> 23:19.022
"No friends"?
You have the best friends.

23:24.736 --> 23:27.447
Target located.
We’re at the Scareport.

23:27.948 --> 23:30.450
Loud and clear.
On our way.

23:36.790 --> 23:39.417
You’ve been working out?
Who’s your trainer?

23:39.501 --> 23:40.877
Ow!

23:40.961 --> 23:43.213
I was trained by
the misery of life

23:43.296 --> 23:45.006
and this foul
and heartless city.

23:47.592 --> 23:49.678
Snap out of it!
We go way back.

23:53.932 --> 23:56.685
All my best memories of
Green Hill have you in ’em,

23:56.768 --> 23:58.061
and you’re not punching me.

24:04.818 --> 24:06.319
Don’t you want to go home?

24:06.403 --> 24:09.447
Blue skies,
sunny beaches, palm trees?

24:13.910 --> 24:15.787
I don’t know what kind of
mind games you’re playing,

24:15.871 --> 24:18.707
but it won’t work!

24:18.790 --> 24:19.708
Whoa!

24:30.177 --> 24:32.387
You saved me?

24:32.470 --> 24:35.140
I’ve been trying to
tell you that we are friends.

24:35.223 --> 24:37.267
Fabricated stories
won’t keep me from

24:37.350 --> 24:38.977
beating you back, intruder!

24:39.060 --> 24:42.439
Stop. Just stop.

24:43.273 --> 24:46.401
We’re friends.
Best friends.

24:46.484 --> 24:48.486
This has to ring a bell.

24:48.570 --> 24:51.573
From the very moment
we first met,

24:51.656 --> 24:54.409
you were a happy,
brainy little fox

24:54.492 --> 24:57.495
<i>doing happy,</i>
<i>brainy little fox things.</i>

24:57.579 --> 24:59.289
<i>Some blockhead bullies</i>

24:59.372 --> 25:02.083
<i>were picking on you</i>
<i>for having an extra tail.</i>

25:02.167 --> 25:05.962
<i>I ran by, and they lost</i>
<i>interest in being jerks.</i>

25:06.046 --> 25:09.758
<i>How do you know about that?</i>

25:09.841 --> 25:11.760
<i>That’s not how it happened...</i>

25:11.843 --> 25:14.137
<i>and you weren’t there.</i>

25:14.221 --> 25:16.973
<i>I was a kid,</i>
<i>minding my business</i>

25:17.057 --> 25:19.184
<i>but not minding</i>
<i>my surroundings.</i>

25:19.267 --> 25:21.019
<i>Some creeps came along</i>

25:21.102 --> 25:23.271
<i>and picked on me</i>
<i>for having one extra tail.</i>

25:23.355 --> 25:25.440
<i>I took a beating.</i>

25:25.523 --> 25:28.443
<i>It was the same for years,</i>

25:28.526 --> 25:31.238
<i>until I used</i>
<i>my cunning fox brain</i>

25:31.321 --> 25:33.698
<i>to give me</i>
<i>a real way to fight back.</i>

25:35.283 --> 25:38.578
<i>I take care of myself</i>
<i>and need no one.</i>

25:38.662 --> 25:40.038
<i>Period.</i>

25:40.121 --> 25:43.291
No one has friends here.

25:43.375 --> 25:46.044
Why do you think
I live down here?

25:46.127 --> 25:47.796
To avoid everyone...

25:49.005 --> 25:50.507
you included.

25:55.804 --> 25:57.722
Doesn’t make sense.

25:57.806 --> 25:59.849
You are Tails,

25:59.933 --> 26:02.310
but you’re not.

26:02.394 --> 26:04.980
Here, but gone?

26:08.984 --> 26:12.195
So-- so what else did we do?

26:18.868 --> 26:24.374
Well, first of all,
you have the coolest plane.

26:24.457 --> 26:26.251
I do?

26:26.334 --> 26:28.586
It’s called the Tornado.

26:28.670 --> 26:30.797
And we fought
and busted Eggman

26:30.880 --> 26:34.050
like, so many times,
I’ve lost track.

26:34.134 --> 26:36.386
You mean the Chaos Council?

26:36.469 --> 26:38.680
No, I mean Eggman.

26:38.763 --> 26:41.558
So, Mr. Doctor Eggman, then?

26:43.393 --> 26:45.562
Sure. Sounds good.

26:45.645 --> 26:48.606
Look, we’ve had our share
of ups and downs,

26:48.690 --> 26:52.152
but when we stick together,
we never lose.

26:52.235 --> 26:55.238
And when all’s said and done,
there’s no better reward

26:55.322 --> 26:58.283
than sharing a chili dog
with your best pal.

26:58.366 --> 27:00.535
And that’s just
the tip of the iceberg.

27:00.618 --> 27:02.412
We’ve got a lifetime
of adventures

27:02.495 --> 27:03.830
and memories together.

27:03.913 --> 27:07.751
Um, I--I think your
shoes are smoldering.

27:09.544 --> 27:11.254
Of course they are.

27:11.338 --> 27:13.923
What else can go wrong
in this crazy place?

27:14.007 --> 27:15.884
The only thing I despise

27:15.967 --> 27:19.137
more than people
in my space is whiners.

27:19.220 --> 27:22.307
Wait! I thought we just
had a bonding moment.

27:22.390 --> 27:23.725
Stay still.

27:31.191 --> 27:33.610
Curious.
There’s low-level energy

27:33.693 --> 27:35.445
throughout your entire body.

27:35.528 --> 27:37.989
But possibly
a regulator could...

27:38.073 --> 27:39.199
Follow me!

27:52.670 --> 27:54.589
I, uh, like them,
by the way.

27:54.672 --> 27:57.592
Those ratty old sneakers?
Obviously.

27:57.675 --> 28:00.512
No. I mean, I always thought
your extra tail was cool,

28:00.595 --> 28:02.055
but the metal ones?

28:02.138 --> 28:04.015
Man, you’re amazing.

28:04.099 --> 28:07.227
Uh, sure.
One last touch.

28:07.310 --> 28:09.437
Attach these.

28:09.521 --> 28:11.606
They might be able
to regulate the excess energy

28:11.689 --> 28:13.566
coming off your gear
so they don’t explode.

28:13.650 --> 28:14.651
"Might"?

28:16.152 --> 28:18.905
This energy
is still a mystery.

28:37.006 --> 28:38.800
Whoa! What are these?

28:38.883 --> 28:41.219
No, energy overflow
and the look.

28:41.302 --> 28:43.680
I mean, come on.
Mwah!

28:43.763 --> 28:46.766
Ah, curious. They’re still
your gloves and shoes,

28:46.850 --> 28:49.185
only now they seem to
have attuned with the energy

28:49.269 --> 28:51.771
in your body
instead of resisting it.

28:51.855 --> 28:53.440
I wonder why that is.

28:53.523 --> 28:55.150
Oh-ho, these are killer!

28:55.233 --> 28:57.694
No more slipping and sliding,
no smoke.

28:57.777 --> 29:00.989
Thanks, Tails. I mean, Nine.
Time for a test drive.

29:01.072 --> 29:03.908
No, wait, you dope!
It’s not safe.

29:06.578 --> 29:08.663
Hey, if the mad scientist-
slash-loner thing

29:08.747 --> 29:11.541
doesn’t work out, you should
get into fashion accessories.

29:11.624 --> 29:13.168
Stylin’!

29:13.251 --> 29:16.504
Shh! We need to
maintain a low profile.

29:16.588 --> 29:19.048
The Council has eyes everywhere.

29:19.132 --> 29:20.884
When you get your memory back,

29:20.967 --> 29:24.137
you’ll remember that
low profile isn’t my thing.

29:24.220 --> 29:26.890
-Want to run up the walls?
-What? No.

29:32.437 --> 29:34.439
Not the baby.

29:34.522 --> 29:36.566
I told you
to keep a low profile.

29:36.649 --> 29:37.817
No, you didn’t.

29:37.901 --> 29:39.611
-Yes, I did.
-You didn’t.

29:39.694 --> 29:42.530
-Yes, I did.
-No, you didn’t.

29:42.614 --> 29:44.949
Are you sure
we were best friends?

29:46.201 --> 29:49.329
-Blue Streak has a friend?
-Didn’t look friendly.

29:49.412 --> 29:52.332
But whoever he is,
he’s involved now.

29:58.755 --> 30:02.509
Who’s there?
Hello?

30:02.592 --> 30:05.887
Hello?

30:05.970 --> 30:09.307
Ow! A little warning.
Man, that’s bright.

30:11.017 --> 30:13.394
Hello? Tissue?

30:16.564 --> 30:18.024
You’re wasting your breath.

30:18.107 --> 30:20.068
Nine, is that you?

30:20.151 --> 30:23.238
Are you the small blurry thing
or the medium blurry thing?

30:23.321 --> 30:25.323
Or the big blurry--

30:25.406 --> 30:27.158
Amy?!

30:27.242 --> 30:30.078
Amy! All right.
Now we’re getting somewhere.

30:30.161 --> 30:31.955
-Got a key?
-Negative.

30:32.038 --> 30:35.667
My identification
is Rusty Rose.

30:35.750 --> 30:37.377
You’re a robot!

30:37.460 --> 30:39.629
No. Mechanically enhanced.

30:39.712 --> 30:43.299
Survival required adaptation,
as you will soon learn.

30:43.383 --> 30:47.178
-Oh, Amy.
-Rusty Rose. Cease talking.

30:47.262 --> 30:49.180
You will need all the breath
you can muster

30:49.264 --> 30:51.558
if you are to survive.

31:05.905 --> 31:08.950
More silhouettes?
Who does your lighting?

31:09.951 --> 31:12.203
The Chaos Council.

31:12.287 --> 31:13.913
Dr. Done-It.

31:15.623 --> 31:17.458
I’m awake.
I’m awake.

31:17.542 --> 31:19.669
Go on. You were saying.

31:19.752 --> 31:21.379
Dr. Deep.

31:21.462 --> 31:24.090
The philosophical ramifications

31:24.173 --> 31:27.260
of this discovery
rock my very core.

31:27.343 --> 31:29.012
Dr. Don’t.

31:30.138 --> 31:31.806
Whatevs.

31:31.890 --> 31:33.725
And you have already met

31:33.808 --> 31:36.561
the baby, Dr. Babble.

31:40.607 --> 31:42.734
That is the angriest baby
I’ve ever met.

31:42.817 --> 31:47.488
And finally,
Mr. Doctor Eggman.

31:49.073 --> 31:52.535
Oh, so that’s who
you were talking about!

31:53.995 --> 31:56.623
By the dumbfounded
look in your eyes,

31:56.706 --> 31:58.082
I gather you’ve come to grips

31:58.166 --> 32:00.627
with the gravity
of your situation.

32:00.710 --> 32:04.505
"The Council"? Looks like
an Eggman family reunion.

32:04.589 --> 32:07.008
When did you call in
reinforcements, Eggy?

32:07.091 --> 32:09.177
We are not a family, rodent.

32:09.260 --> 32:12.931
We are The Council.
One makes five.

32:13.014 --> 32:15.224
Five makes one.

32:20.104 --> 32:23.566
So many Eggmans,
so many questions.

32:23.650 --> 32:26.319
Does anyone have an aspirin?

32:26.402 --> 32:28.655
How could you not know?!

32:28.738 --> 32:30.448
We’re famous.

32:30.531 --> 32:33.284
We are what we are.

32:33.368 --> 32:36.496
Always have been,
always will be.

32:36.579 --> 32:39.374
So this creature
made all that fuss?

32:39.457 --> 32:43.670
Doesn’t look like much to me.

32:43.753 --> 32:47.423
Hey, I respect creaky old stuff,
but poke me again,

32:47.507 --> 32:50.259
and I’ll crack your
antique shell, Egg-gramps.

32:50.343 --> 32:54.180
-I told you.

32:54.263 --> 32:56.265
It seems to know who we are,

32:56.349 --> 32:59.686
yet we have no information
on it in our databanks.

32:59.769 --> 33:02.105
"It"? Really?

33:02.188 --> 33:05.733
Like it popped into
existence from nowhere.

33:05.817 --> 33:09.278
What? I’ve been here
the whole time, dude.

33:09.362 --> 33:11.739
Perhaps answers lie
in the energy signature

33:11.823 --> 33:13.741
-the creature exhibits.

33:18.329 --> 33:20.581
May I suggest
a series of grueling

33:20.665 --> 33:22.500
life-endangering
diagnostic tests?

33:22.583 --> 33:23.835
Not helping, Amy.

33:23.918 --> 33:26.129
You know I don’t do well
on tests.

33:26.212 --> 33:30.425
Those in favor of stress-testing
this blue rabbit, say yes.

33:30.508 --> 33:31.634
-Oh, yes, please.

33:33.928 --> 33:34.929
Hey, hey!

33:45.523 --> 33:47.608
Rusty, put him
through the paces.

33:47.692 --> 33:51.279
Let’s see how powerful he is.

33:54.073 --> 33:58.327
Do not fight them.
It will only end badly for him.

33:58.411 --> 34:00.455
-Nine!

34:03.916 --> 34:06.544
Okay, let’s start the test.
The sooner we do this,

34:06.627 --> 34:08.588
the sooner Nine and I
can get out of here.

34:16.387 --> 34:19.849
Lasers. I hate lasers.

34:23.895 --> 34:26.689
-Nice!

35:24.539 --> 35:26.541
Seriously? A hamster ball?

35:26.624 --> 35:28.459
What is wrong
with you people?

35:28.543 --> 35:30.753
The tests are
still inconclusive.

35:30.837 --> 35:33.422
His maximum limits
remain unknown.

35:33.506 --> 35:36.551
Make the blue badger run.

35:36.634 --> 35:39.220
-Come on, Amy!

35:39.303 --> 35:41.472
Some compassion
for your boy Sonic!

35:41.556 --> 35:44.183
You can’t suddenly
be this heartless.

35:45.101 --> 35:48.020
Birdie would disagree.

35:50.523 --> 35:52.984
That’s so messed up.

35:54.193 --> 35:56.737
Sonic!

35:56.821 --> 35:58.406
You want to
test me, Eggheads?

35:58.489 --> 36:00.950
How do you
tick off a hedgehog?

36:01.951 --> 36:04.328
Answer:
Mess with his friends.

36:14.881 --> 36:17.508
I totally call dibs
on his quills.

36:27.185 --> 36:31.230
I knew it. He’s got the same
energy that powers the city.

36:32.815 --> 36:36.319
The energy field is
supercharging our systems.

36:38.404 --> 36:41.866
Turns out the blue possum
has some juice after all.

36:55.296 --> 36:58.549
Sonic, it’s broken!
It’s all broken!

36:58.633 --> 37:03.012
Shadow?! Uh-oh, I think
I’m starting to hallucinate.

37:14.482 --> 37:16.067
Let’s stick
together and we’ll--

37:16.150 --> 37:18.569
Perfect! I’m gonna ring up.
Meet you there.

37:18.653 --> 37:19.654
Sonic!

37:24.492 --> 37:27.995
I guess he didn’t hear
the "stick together" part.

37:28.079 --> 37:29.872
-Does he ever?
-No.

37:29.956 --> 37:33.000
But he also hasn’t let us down
when it really counts.

37:33.084 --> 37:35.836
You know Sonic.
He’ll catch up at some point.

37:48.099 --> 37:51.560
Wow!
Are you guys seeing this?

37:51.644 --> 37:54.981
Look at the fault line.
It goes right up the mountain.

37:55.064 --> 37:56.107
Ugh.

37:56.190 --> 37:58.025
Anyone noticing that?

37:58.901 --> 38:01.362
That cloud
hasn’t moved an inch.

38:02.488 --> 38:05.783
Something’s unnatural.
Tails!

38:05.866 --> 38:07.493
Already on it.

38:20.298 --> 38:23.968
Whoa. Do you
think Sonic’s in there?

38:24.051 --> 38:26.220
With all those
badniks still standing?

38:26.304 --> 38:28.639
Our pal’s not
exactly the stealthy type.

38:28.723 --> 38:31.309
We got here before him?
How?

38:31.392 --> 38:32.685
Find a spot to land.

38:32.768 --> 38:34.979
Let’s find out what’s going on.

38:39.525 --> 38:41.944
We can
wrap this up before dinner.

38:42.028 --> 38:43.946
Mmm. Chili dogs.

38:44.030 --> 38:47.867
But first, just in case Eggman
gets in a lucky shot, Rings!

39:06.427 --> 39:07.845
Ahhhh!
