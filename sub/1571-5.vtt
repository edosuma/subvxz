Good afternoon, Quahog.

00:36.670 --> 00:38.637
Our top story:
price wars are heating up

00:38.639 --> 00:40.572
between all of
the major airlines

00:40.574 --> 00:42.808
and even a couple of
the little crashy ones.

00:42.810 --> 00:44.510
We now go live
to Tricia Takanawa

00:44.512 --> 00:45.711
with more on the story.

00:45.713 --> 00:49.415
Tom, I'm standing here at
Boston's Logan Airport,

00:49.417 --> 00:51.383
where some of the same
security people

00:51.385 --> 00:52.985
who let the terrorists
on the plane

00:52.987 --> 00:54.920
are still gainfully employed.

00:54.922 --> 00:57.723
With such low fares,
even those who never fly

00:57.725 --> 01:00.692
are lining up
to buy tickets.

01:00.694 --> 01:01.760
Early reports suggest

01:01.762 --> 01:03.862
that this could be
the most profitable day

01:03.864 --> 01:06.765
for airlines in
the last two decades.

01:06.767 --> 01:07.900
I'm Tricia Takanawa.

01:07.902 --> 01:09.068
Back to you, Tom.

01:09.070 --> 01:10.102
Hi, Mom.

01:10.104 --> 01:11.837
(in Joe's voice):
Hi, Joe.

01:11.839 --> 01:13.839
Wow, Peter,
did you hear that?

01:13.841 --> 01:14.606
Low airfares.

01:14.608 --> 01:16.108
Why don't we
take a trip?

01:16.110 --> 01:18.010
We never go
anywhere anymore.

01:18.012 --> 01:19.011
We're gettin' stagnant.

01:19.013 --> 01:20.012
What are you
talking about?

01:20.014 --> 01:21.013
We go places.

01:21.015 --> 01:23.182
We took that helicopter
tour of Tucson.

01:23.184 --> 01:25.117
Wow. I've never seen
so many boats

01:25.119 --> 01:26.952
not near bodies of water.

01:26.954 --> 01:29.121
That park is all concrete.

01:29.123 --> 01:32.024
Look, there's a dog
tied to a other dog.

01:32.026 --> 01:34.560
I think that guy with
long hair is a lawyer.

01:34.562 --> 01:37.896
Look at all those students
running for their lives.

01:37.898 --> 01:40.132
Oh, there's
the concrete park again.

01:40.134 --> 01:42.734
Peter, I'm talking
about real travel.

01:42.736 --> 01:44.703
We can finally afford
to go somewhere good.

01:44.705 --> 01:46.138
Joe and Bonnie
went to Europe

01:46.140 --> 01:47.639
and had the time
of their lives.

01:47.641 --> 01:50.042
Hey, I know a place
you can go, Lois: Hell.

01:50.044 --> 01:51.944
There, I said it.
Now shut your mouth.

01:51.946 --> 01:53.445
Lois, I hate travelling.

01:53.447 --> 01:55.514
Besides, my passport
picture is awful.

01:58.551 --> 02:00.819
Ugh, you look like
a human cigarette.

02:00.821 --> 02:02.588
But it's not just
about you, Peter.

02:02.590 --> 02:03.789
Think about the family.

02:03.791 --> 02:05.991
It would be an amazing
experience for the kids.

02:05.993 --> 02:07.659
It would give them
some culture.

02:07.661 --> 02:09.828
Lois, the kids can get
all the culture they need

02:09.830 --> 02:10.896
right here in Quahog.

02:10.898 --> 02:11.897
Really?

02:11.899 --> 02:13.232
More culture
than Europe?

02:13.234 --> 02:15.067
That's right, and I'm
gonna prove it to you.

02:15.069 --> 02:16.902
I got more culture
in my pinkie toe

02:16.904 --> 02:18.470
than all of Europe
put together.

02:20.507 --> 02:22.574
(singing opera)

02:30.617 --> 02:33.418
(wild applause)

02:33.420 --> 02:34.753
Oh, my God!

02:34.755 --> 02:37.990
I got ringworm, too,
but it's not classy like this.

02:40.326 --> 02:43.295
Okay, kids, now this is
the Quahog Museum of Science.

02:43.297 --> 02:46.798
A magical place
of cultural exploration.

02:46.800 --> 02:49.835
♪

02:57.510 --> 02:59.178
That sucked.

03:00.780 --> 03:02.948
Now, one thing that
makes us more cultured

03:02.950 --> 03:05.517
than our European counterparts
is high school football.

03:05.519 --> 03:07.819
Then why are we standing here
in the parking lot?

03:07.821 --> 03:09.454
Because sometimes
your team loses,

03:09.456 --> 03:10.856
and you have to
beat up the ref.

03:12.792 --> 03:14.526
What part
of Eatonville you from, huh?

03:14.528 --> 03:16.328
What part of Eatonville
you from?

03:16.330 --> 03:17.796
Ow! West Eatonville.

03:17.798 --> 03:18.830
Oh, really?
West Eatonville?

03:18.832 --> 03:20.199
Do you know Bob Hanley?

03:20.201 --> 03:22.000
I'm Bob Hanley.
No kidding!

03:22.002 --> 03:23.669
Bob, it's me, Peter Griffin.

03:23.671 --> 03:25.470
Oh, my God,
how the hell are you?

03:25.472 --> 03:27.239
I'm doing great.
I'm doing great.

03:27.241 --> 03:28.507
Well, hey, oh, listen.

03:28.509 --> 03:29.741
I was really sorry
to hear about your dad.

03:29.743 --> 03:31.043
Oh, that means a lot.

03:31.045 --> 03:33.145
Yeah, I'm sorry
I couldn't make it to the wake.

03:33.147 --> 03:34.346
I was out of town.

03:34.348 --> 03:35.914
It's okay.
Thanks for the flowers.

03:35.916 --> 03:37.216
Oh, it's the least I could do.

03:37.218 --> 03:38.383
Hey, Chris, get over here.

03:38.385 --> 03:40.752
You got to meet
my buddy Bob Hanley.

03:40.754 --> 03:42.821
Hi, Mr. Hanley.
I'm Chris.

03:42.823 --> 03:45.958
I heard a lot about you, sir.

03:49.028 --> 03:51.997
We now return
to <i>Downton Syndrome.</i>

03:51.999 --> 03:54.166
Well, if I must accept
your proposal in order

03:54.168 --> 03:56.735
to break the entail
and save my family's estate,

03:56.737 --> 03:59.071
then yes, I will marry you.

03:59.073 --> 04:00.906
Yay!

04:00.908 --> 04:03.575
Everyone,
I've got a surprise.

04:03.577 --> 04:06.345
Whoa!
I did not see that coming.

04:06.347 --> 04:08.180
No, Chris,
I haven't said it yet.

04:08.182 --> 04:10.382
Today was the last day
of the low airfares,

04:10.384 --> 04:13.685
and I couldn't let
the opportunity pass, so...

04:13.687 --> 04:15.854
I got us tickets to Italy!

04:15.856 --> 04:17.389
That's amazing, Mom!

04:17.391 --> 04:18.924
Lois, is Peter
okay with this?

04:18.926 --> 04:22.027
Well, Brian, I haven't
quite told him yet.

04:22.029 --> 04:23.128
But what if he says no?

04:23.130 --> 04:24.863
He can't say no.

04:24.865 --> 04:26.198
I already
bought the tickets.

04:26.200 --> 04:27.199
Tickets for what?

04:27.201 --> 04:28.267
Uh, uh...

04:28.269 --> 04:30.936
tickets for the, um,
the grand opening

04:30.938 --> 04:33.905
of the biggest water park
in all of Rhode Island.

04:33.907 --> 04:35.974
Hmm, well, pardon
my skepticism, Lois,

04:35.976 --> 04:37.809
but I didn't read
about this in the latest issue

04:37.811 --> 04:39.945
of   <i>Water Park Enthusiast Week.</i>

04:39.947 --> 04:43.415
Well, they-they had
to, um, keep it secret.

04:43.417 --> 04:45.817
For fear that, um...

04:45.819 --> 04:47.452
th-that this new park would put

04:47.454 --> 04:49.755
all other water parks
out of business.

04:49.757 --> 04:50.889
Typical Big Water.

04:50.891 --> 04:52.758
Always keeping the
public in the dark.

04:52.760 --> 04:55.060
So this one's bigger
than Raging Waters?

04:55.062 --> 04:56.728
Yeah, Dad.
It's way bigger.

04:56.730 --> 04:57.963
How does the boy know?

04:57.965 --> 04:59.131
Uh, because I-I told him.

04:59.133 --> 05:01.466
I-I know someone who-who helped,
uh, build it.

05:01.468 --> 05:03.902
Wow, so we really got an
inside track on this thing.

05:03.904 --> 05:05.937
But it can't be bigger
than Six Flags Atlantis.

05:05.939 --> 05:08.073
Oh, it is, Peter, it is.

05:08.075 --> 05:09.074
Because...

05:09.076 --> 05:11.910
it's Seven Flags Atlantis.

05:11.912 --> 05:14.646
(gasps) That's a whole flag
more of water!

05:14.648 --> 05:15.914
Get in the car!

05:15.916 --> 05:17.849
Okay, everyone,
put the sunblock on now,

05:17.851 --> 05:19.918
so when we get off the plane,
we go right to the park.

05:19.920 --> 05:21.820
Wait, why are we on a plane?

05:21.822 --> 05:24.122
Uh, you-you want to beat the
lines, don't you, Peter?

05:24.124 --> 05:25.490
All-all right, Brian, enough.

05:25.492 --> 05:27.693
I-I can't
do this anymore.

05:27.695 --> 05:29.928
Peter, we're not
going to a water park.

05:29.930 --> 05:31.697
We're going to Italy.

05:31.699 --> 05:34.166
What?! But what about
Seven Flags Atlantis?

05:34.168 --> 05:35.667
Peter, don't be silly.

05:35.669 --> 05:37.502
Th-There's no such place.

05:37.504 --> 05:38.970
(over P.A.):
This is your captain speaking.

05:38.972 --> 05:41.106
If you look out the left side
of the airplane,

05:41.108 --> 05:43.775
you'll see the very popular
Seven Flags Atlantis.

05:43.777 --> 05:45.544
Aw!

05:45.546 --> 05:49.114
(children laughing)

05:49.116 --> 05:51.116
I'm gonna go ahead
and turn off the seatbelt sign,

05:51.118 --> 05:54.853
so you idiots can all stretch
and let the fart festival begin.

05:54.855 --> 05:56.488
Why are you such
a dick, Jim?

05:56.490 --> 05:59.091
I'm just mad
about pilot stuff.

06:05.798 --> 06:08.066
I can't believe you tricked
me into going to Italy.

06:08.068 --> 06:10.235
Peter, our family could use
a trip like this.

06:10.237 --> 06:13.038
Plus, it might be good
for you and me, too.

06:13.040 --> 06:15.974
It's the most romantic country
in the whole world.

06:15.976 --> 06:18.577
And God knows we could use a
little romance in our marriage.

06:18.579 --> 06:19.911
What are you talking about?

06:19.913 --> 06:22.047
Just the other night
we did that role-playing.

06:22.049 --> 06:25.350
Did you like that game of
mysterious intruder, Lois?

06:25.352 --> 06:27.085
I told you--
I don't know who you are.

06:27.087 --> 06:29.087
And my name isn't Lois.

06:29.089 --> 06:30.355
Mine is.

06:30.357 --> 06:32.290
Let's do it again.

06:39.699 --> 06:41.400
Is it true there's
no drinking age here?

06:41.402 --> 06:43.101
And they serve wine
at every meal?

06:43.103 --> 06:46.037
Oh, Meg, nobody
likes a drunky-chunky.

06:46.039 --> 06:49.174
In college, a lot of guys
are gonna make you a dare.

06:50.676 --> 06:52.878
Hey, you know what, guys?
We're six hours ahead here.

06:52.880 --> 06:54.679
I'm gonna call Joe
and tell him the future.

06:54.681 --> 06:56.214
(buttons beeping)

06:56.216 --> 06:58.550
Hey, Joe, guess
what's about to happen?

06:58.552 --> 06:59.618
Who is this?

06:59.620 --> 07:00.619
It's Peter.

07:00.621 --> 07:01.753
That's impossible.

07:01.755 --> 07:03.555
Peter died six hours ago.

07:03.557 --> 07:04.589
(gasps)

07:04.591 --> 07:05.791
We can't go back.

07:15.101 --> 07:16.968
Look, kids,
this is the Forum,

07:16.970 --> 07:18.637
where the ancient Romans
used to have

07:18.639 --> 07:20.405
their famous
political debates.

07:20.407 --> 07:23.074
And this is the <i>Penthouse</i> Forum,
where dirtbags write letters

07:23.076 --> 07:25.210
about boning in the
back of grocery stores.

07:25.212 --> 07:27.312
Well, who wants to see where
the ancients established

07:27.314 --> 07:29.915
the foundation of
our American democracy?

07:29.917 --> 07:32.217
And who wants to hear
a story about a girl

07:32.219 --> 07:33.885
who moved to New York
without any underpants?

07:35.087 --> 07:36.488
I don't know
why we even go places.

07:36.490 --> 07:38.824
We always just end up
reading pornography.

07:42.228 --> 07:44.996
We now return
to <i>Italian Star Trek.</i>

07:44.998 --> 07:46.998
I know I supposed
to be-a so logical,

07:47.000 --> 07:50.135
but I get-a so steaming a-mad!

07:50.137 --> 07:53.438
Peter, the kids are going
to the Italian circus,

07:53.440 --> 07:55.907
so I thought
it might be romantic

07:55.909 --> 07:58.009
if we watched the sunset
from St. Peter's Basilica.

07:58.011 --> 08:00.111
You go ahead, I'm gonna stay
here and get frustrated

08:00.113 --> 08:03.148
with this nonresponsive
hotel TV remote.

08:03.150 --> 08:05.484
Come on! Guide!

08:05.486 --> 08:07.552
I'm pressing "Guide"!

08:09.689 --> 08:12.324
Stupid remote's
not doing anything!

08:16.496 --> 08:18.263
Stop what you're doing!

08:18.265 --> 08:20.198
Peter, you can't just
sit in front of the TV

08:20.200 --> 08:21.633
the entire vacation.

08:21.635 --> 08:23.101
You know, I'm really getting
tired of you being

08:23.103 --> 08:25.036
such a complete
stick-in-the-mud.

08:25.038 --> 08:26.538
Is that some kind
of gay slur?

08:26.540 --> 08:28.106
I can't believe it's
too much for you

08:28.108 --> 08:29.641
to watch a sunset
with your wife

08:29.643 --> 08:31.710
in one of the most romantic
cities in the world!

08:31.712 --> 08:32.878
But, you know what?

08:32.880 --> 08:34.179
It's probably for the best.

08:34.181 --> 08:35.981
Because you'd just
complain about it!

08:35.983 --> 08:37.516
Well, what do you expect, Lois?
I didn't want to come here

08:37.518 --> 08:39.851
in the first place.
I'd rather be back home.

08:39.853 --> 08:42.354
You know, I could be
riding seesaw with Joe.

08:42.356 --> 08:44.422
Yay!

08:46.559 --> 08:47.893
Well, I guess we're stuck.

08:47.895 --> 08:50.128
Hang on.
Let me empty this bag.

08:50.130 --> 08:52.464
Yay, gross.

08:52.466 --> 08:54.366
Fine, you just sit
here on the couch.

08:54.368 --> 08:57.569
I'll go enjoy
Italy without you!

08:59.338 --> 09:01.239
God, what the hell's
her problem?

09:01.241 --> 09:02.641
You know, sometimes
I think you forget

09:02.643 --> 09:04.142
how lucky you
are to have Lois.

09:04.144 --> 09:06.645
Otherwise, you wouldn't be
acting like such a jerk.

09:06.647 --> 09:08.079
Oh, I'm getting it
from you now?

09:08.081 --> 09:09.314
Don't worry about Lois.

09:09.316 --> 09:11.082
She's an American woman
in Italy.

09:11.084 --> 09:12.551
She'll go out,
kill her roommate

09:12.553 --> 09:14.519
during a sex game,
and then she'll be fine.

09:14.521 --> 09:16.154
She might come back
even hotter.

09:16.156 --> 09:18.089
Well, you might want
to look out there.

09:20.693 --> 09:23.261
What the hell's she doing
with that Italian guy?

going on here?

09:50.223 --> 09:51.957
Ah, we're
just having fun, Peter.

09:51.959 --> 09:54.025
Something you know
nothing about.

09:55.795 --> 09:57.395
Oh, man, she really is upset.

alive in Italy, so am I.

10:07.774 --> 10:10.308
Now, look, buddy, there's
a million ways to lose a gal,

10:10.310 --> 10:12.711
but there's only one sure way
to get her back.

10:12.713 --> 10:15.313
Turn on the old Italian charm.

10:15.315 --> 10:16.414
But I'm not Italian.

10:16.416 --> 10:18.216
Well, you're in Italy,
ain't you?

10:18.218 --> 10:20.485
I think so, I-I haven't
been paying attention.

10:20.487 --> 10:21.953

Hey! Get away from him!

10:49.249 --> 10:50.815
Peter, you okay?

10:50.817 --> 10:53.284
Brian? What happened?

10:53.286 --> 10:54.519
I was watching you
from the window.

10:54.521 --> 10:56.254
When Lois pulled away
on that motorcycle,

10:56.256 --> 10:58.356
you laid down on the ground
and went to sleep.

10:58.358 --> 10:59.958
Well, I'm awake

10:59.960 --> 11:01.926

11:01.928 --> 11:03.128
Well, before you
do anything,

11:03.130 --> 11:04.496
for God's sake,
put some clothes on.

11:04.498 --> 11:05.664
Brian, calm down.

11:05.666 --> 11:08.033

Look, Peter, showing up here
in that stupid costume

11:32.993 --> 11:34.392
isn't going to win me over.

to hold up a romantic
message just for you.

12:24.111 --> 12:25.176
Oh, they missed a letter.

12:33.719 --> 12:37.021
Okay, I'll admit it--
this is pretty romantic.

I'm sorry for being
such a jerk, all right?

the best sex I've ever had.

13:15.228 --> 13:17.162

13:17.164 --> 13:18.963
We haven't done it like that
since we were engaged

13:18.965 --> 13:20.665
but allowed to sleep
with other people.

13:20.667 --> 13:22.167
What-What are you
talking about?

13:22.169 --> 13:24.769
The point is, Italy is the best
thing that ever happened to us.

13:24.771 --> 13:26.838
I know, it's been
wonderful.

13:26.840 --> 13:28.506
I wish we never
had to leave.

13:28.508 --> 13:31.109
Well, then, let's not.
Let's live here.

13:31.111 --> 13:32.677
What? Peter, but...

13:32.679 --> 13:35.280
but we've built a life
back in Quahog.

13:35.282 --> 13:36.481
Yeah, but you
were right, Lois,

13:36.483 --> 13:38.349
we were stagnating
back home.

right here in Italy.

13:44.123 --> 13:45.924

13:54.534 --> 13:55.700
Well, if we're
going to be Italian,

13:55.702 --> 13:58.036
I guess we should start
murdering our brothers.

13:59.471 --> 14:00.805
What are you...?

14:00.807 --> 14:02.674

I no wanna do that!

14:44.818 --> 14:46.217
Peter, I know you
love it here,

14:46.219 --> 14:47.518
but riding your
bike around town

14:47.520 --> 14:48.720
isn't paying the bills,

15:04.070 --> 15:06.371
to go back to our
real home in Quahog.

15:06.373 --> 15:07.872
But I thought
you loved Italy.

15:07.874 --> 15:09.374

15:09.376 --> 15:10.875
And Southern
Italian Peter.

surviving here.

most of what you earn

16:23.415 --> 16:24.749
So, you see, Mr. Consulate,

16:24.751 --> 16:26.985
all we want to do is get back
to our home in America.

16:26.987 --> 16:29.187
So, can we have
our new passports now?

16:29.189 --> 16:31.089
Mr. Griffin, it's not
as simple as that.

16:31.091 --> 16:33.191
Your family must take
a citizenship test

16:33.193 --> 16:34.625
and go through
the immigration process

16:34.627 --> 16:36.461
like any other
foreigner.

16:36.463 --> 16:38.596
Foreigner?
We're not foreigners.

16:38.598 --> 16:39.630
Sorry, Mrs. Griffin.

16:39.632 --> 16:41.332
Not only did you
destroy your passports,

16:41.334 --> 16:43.267
you renounced our citizenship.

16:43.269 --> 16:44.435
When did we do that?

16:44.437 --> 16:45.503
Oh, I did that

16:45.505 --> 16:46.838
on the Italian social
networking site,

16:46.840 --> 16:48.673
"Shut-up-a-you-facebook."

16:58.784 --> 17:00.718
All right, Meg, part of
being an American citizen

17:00.720 --> 17:03.888
is having an opinion on certain
hot-button political issues.

17:03.890 --> 17:06.357
Now, what is your
abortion stance?

17:06.359 --> 17:08.926

you listed employment,

17:44.764 --> 17:46.330

17:52.539 --> 17:53.604
All right,
now that you've completed

17:53.606 --> 17:54.839
your initial application,

17:54.841 --> 17:56.741
it will need to be filed
by an immigration lawyer

17:56.743 --> 17:59.777
at a cost of approximately
$5,000 per person.

17:59.779 --> 18:01.712
And assuming
that all goes through,

18:01.714 --> 18:04.749
you should have your
citizenship back in 16 months.

18:04.751 --> 18:06.184
Sixteen months?

18:06.186 --> 18:07.752
If I didn't know any better,

18:07.754 --> 18:08.853
I'd think you were making it

18:08.855 --> 18:10.855
hard to become
a citizen on purpose.

18:10.857 --> 18:13.591
Like you don't want any
immigrants coming to the U.S.

18:13.593 --> 18:14.859
I wish that were true,
Mrs. Griffin,

18:14.861 --> 18:16.627
and it probably might be.

18:16.629 --> 18:19.430
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to go sit on my fat wife.

we going to do?

18:27.607 --> 18:29.040
I'll tell you what
we're going to do.

18:29.042 --> 18:30.374
We're going
to sneak in.

18:30.376 --> 18:31.976
Well, we better get there soon.

18:31.978 --> 18:35.279
I want to be there for opening

19:48.287 --> 19:51.789
(clearing throat)

19:54.860 --> 19:57.828
Well, I'm so glad to finally
be back home in Quahog.

19:57.830 --> 19:59.363
Although,
I will miss Italy.

19:59.365 --> 20:02.900
You made the trip very
special for me, Peter.

20:02.902 --> 20:04.835
Well, thanks for showing
me and the kids

20:04.837 --> 20:06.804
what the rest of
the world is like, Lois.

20:06.806 --> 20:08.706
I think we all learned a lot.

20:08.708 --> 20:10.141
And we met a lot
of great people.

20:10.143 --> 20:12.376
Hey, what about that
couple we met in Amalfi?

20:12.378 --> 20:13.411
Did you get their number?

20:13.413 --> 20:14.478
I did. You ready?
Yup.

20:14.480 --> 20:18.583
Okay, it's
19-565-55018...

20:18.585 --> 20:20.918
81-453...

20:20.920 --> 20:22.553
989-90...

20:22.555 --> 20:26.591
016-8945-2.

20:26.593 --> 20:28.859
Well, I can't wait to see the
rest of the world with you guys.

20:28.861 --> 20:30.461
(pounding at door)

20:31.897 --> 20:33.598
Mario! You came for me!

20:33.600 --> 20:35.499
Come with me, Meg,
my princess.

20:35.501 --> 20:38.736
We gonna take this relationship
to the next level.

20:38.738 --> 20:40.805
(game music playing)

20:44.843 --> 20:46.010
MEG:
Luigi's here again?

20:46.012 --> 20:47.411
I thought that was
a one-time thing.

20:47.413 --> 20:48.679
MARIO:
He like-a my sloppy seconds.

20:48.681 --> 20:49.680
LUIGI:
We-a plumber brothers.

20:49.682 --> 20:51.749
We-a not-a high class people.
