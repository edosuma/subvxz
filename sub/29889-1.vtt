12:03.855 --> 12:07.125
[video game chiming]

12:10.427 --> 12:12.465
Shepherd,
it's almost time for bed.

12:14.166 --> 12:17.400
I know, Mom. Look, I'm trying.

12:17.402 --> 12:19.102
Okay,
Alton mentioned some temp thing

12:19.104 --> 12:20.236
I can do in the meantime.

12:20.238 --> 12:22.839
It's not that
nude modeling, is it?

12:22.841 --> 12:24.473
Or worse, the Avon?

12:24.475 --> 12:26.074
No.

12:26.076 --> 12:27.977
Well,
maybe it's worse than that even.

12:27.979 --> 12:32.080
Oh, lord, lord, Avon? Sarah.

12:32.082 --> 12:33.016
No.

12:33.018 --> 12:34.050
No, not that.

12:34.052 --> 12:35.251
God, what do you take me for?

12:35.253 --> 12:36.122
No.

12:37.123 --> 12:42.124
It's a crime scene
cleanup specialist thing.

12:42.126 --> 12:44.828
You mean like
car accident debris?

12:44.830 --> 12:45.531
Uh...

12:46.865 --> 12:49.265
Shepherd, five more minutes.

12:49.267 --> 12:51.200
No, no, it's worse, actually.

12:51.202 --> 12:53.905
It's more like homicide cleanup.

12:55.240 --> 12:56.873
Blood, guts,

12:56.875 --> 12:59.575
you know, brains.

12:59.577 --> 13:01.477
Sarah, honey,

13:01.479 --> 13:04.247
you know you have
the weakest stomach ever

13:04.249 --> 13:07.950
and you're also the biggest
sissy on the face of the earth.

13:07.952 --> 13:10.353
You remember that
time your cousin Tracy

13:10.355 --> 13:13.122
snuck you to see
Psycho when you were four?

13:13.124 --> 13:17.560
- How could I forget?
- <i>Well, you slept in our bed until you were 12!</i>

13:17.562 --> 13:19.528
Twelve, right in the middle!

13:19.530 --> 13:20.629
That's why your brother Vinny's

13:20.631 --> 13:21.430
eight years younger than you.

13:21.432 --> 13:24.434
You basically
ruined our sex life.

13:24.436 --> 13:27.136
Oh, your poor father.

13:27.138 --> 13:30.473
Don't get me started,
Sarah, you can't handle it.

13:30.475 --> 13:33.142
I'm going to stick it out. Okay?

13:33.144 --> 13:35.945
At least until I can
get back into Innotech.

13:35.947 --> 13:38.113
You know, you're right,
okay? I have a weak stomach

13:38.115 --> 13:41.184
and I'm a huge baby whenever
it comes to scary stuff.

13:41.186 --> 13:43.286
But, hey,
that's life, am I right?

13:43.288 --> 13:44.954
<i>No, you're not.</i>

13:44.956 --> 13:46.388
Sarah,

13:46.390 --> 13:48.925
I want more grandchildren.

13:48.927 --> 13:51.493
- You need to date.
- Well, all right.

13:51.495 --> 13:54.631
After the day I've had, I
really do need to be taken out.

13:54.633 --> 13:56.435
Either on a date or by a sniper.

13:58.370 --> 14:00.570
Look, I need to put
Shepard to bed, Mama.

14:00.572 --> 14:01.637
I'll keep you posted.

14:01.639 --> 14:03.406
On the dating?

14:03.408 --> 14:04.973
On the job.

14:04.975 --> 14:08.147
[somber synthesizer music]

14:10.315 --> 14:11.948
[Sarah sighing]

14:11.950 --> 14:13.419
I love you so much.

14:16.120 --> 14:18.456
You know,
this is my favorite time of day.

14:19.591 --> 14:21.324
- Mama?
- Yeah?

14:21.326 --> 14:23.258
In our new house,
are we going to have a yard?

14:23.260 --> 14:24.294
Mmmmm.

14:24.296 --> 14:25.929
Yes, honey.

14:25.931 --> 14:27.600
Yeah,
we're going to have a big yard.

14:30.067 --> 14:31.401
Muah.

14:31.403 --> 14:35.206
[pleasant synthesizer music]

14:42.379 --> 14:45.214
[woman crying] Oh, please.

14:45.216 --> 14:46.351
Please, don't.

14:47.251 --> 14:48.120
Please.

14:49.721 --> 14:52.354
I'm going to be a mother.

14:52.356 --> 14:54.225
I'm going to have a baby.

14:57.995 --> 15:00.629

[police sirens wailing]

15:10.442 --> 15:14.647
[suspenseful synthesizer music]

15:21.485 --> 15:25.990
Good morning,
everyone. Thank you for coming.

15:27.192 --> 15:28.657
We do still seem
to be missing one.

15:28.659 --> 15:30.093
We were supposed to
have four today, right?

15:30.095 --> 15:31.096
I don't know.

15:32.464 --> 15:34.696
Oh, okay. No sweat.

15:34.698 --> 15:39.167
Welcome to your first day as
crime scene cleanup specialists.

15:39.169 --> 15:40.703
For the duration of the day,
I'm going to have you guys

15:40.705 --> 15:42.438
watch a series of
instructional videos,

15:42.440 --> 15:45.307
so Todd will be here
to answer any questions

15:45.309 --> 15:46.843
you may have along the way.

15:46.845 --> 15:51.381
Now we do pride ourselves on our open
door policy as well as our transparency

15:51.383 --> 15:55.584
and, of course, we welcome any
feedback that you may have at any time.

15:55.586 --> 15:58.054
We're probably going to be seeing each
other more than we see our own families,

15:58.056 --> 16:00.123
so I'm going to do
what I can to insure

16:00.125 --> 16:03.291
that we enjoy
ourselves on the job.

16:03.293 --> 16:06.628
Oh, you should have
some extra shoe coverings

16:06.630 --> 16:08.634
- underneath your chairs.
- Oh.

16:16.341 --> 16:17.440
I'm going to grab your bootie.

16:17.442 --> 16:18.610
Excuse me?

16:20.110 --> 16:21.643
Oh. No.

16:21.645 --> 16:24.079
Your shoe covering.

16:24.081 --> 16:25.781
- Your...
- Oh.

16:25.783 --> 16:27.282
- I'm sorry.
- My God.

16:27.284 --> 16:28.283
I'm awkward.

16:28.285 --> 16:29.620
Flashback. Uh...

16:30.788 --> 16:31.820
Bootie.

16:31.822 --> 16:32.691
Thank you.

16:34.359 --> 16:35.657
[sighing]

16:35.659 --> 16:38.795
Well, I will forewarn you,

16:38.797 --> 16:42.799
some of what you'll see on
the videos today is a little...

16:42.801 --> 16:44.566
- Crimson.
- Good word.

16:44.568 --> 16:46.201
I like that, yes.

16:46.203 --> 16:49.171
Crimson is a very good word
for what you will be seeing.

16:49.173 --> 16:51.641
Essentially our job is to visit

16:51.643 --> 16:52.508
the aftermath of a crime scene,

16:52.510 --> 16:55.243
which is usually
a homicide or suicide,

16:55.245 --> 16:58.815
and we use industrial
grade cleaners to clean it up.

16:58.817 --> 17:00.315
I'll also advise
you to probably keep

17:00.317 --> 17:02.350
your eyes and ears
peeled on the evening news

17:02.352 --> 17:03.386
because sometimes
you'll get a heads up

17:03.388 --> 17:05.654
as to where we may be
working the following day

17:05.656 --> 17:09.424
- and sometimes it's messy, very messy.
- Is it...

17:09.425 --> 17:11.329
- Yes?
- Is it sanitary?

17:12.430 --> 17:13.628
Uh, no, unfortunately.

17:13.631 --> 17:15.200
It actually gave me the AIDS.

17:16.300 --> 17:18.669
That was a bad joke,
I'm sorry, that was awful.

17:20.505 --> 17:23.205
Yes, yes, it is very sanitary.

17:23.208 --> 17:25.407
Of course, we obviously wear the

17:25.410 --> 17:27.209
industrial grade hazmat suits,

17:27.211 --> 17:28.611
as well as gloves, goggles

17:28.613 --> 17:31.113
and if the situation
calls for it, even gas masks.

17:31.115 --> 17:34.749
Do you ever get used
to it after a while or...

17:34.751 --> 17:38.220
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, and we have
fun on the job just like any other.

17:38.222 --> 17:40.890
It's kind of like, you know
how butchers become so callous

17:40.892 --> 17:42.257
they don't realize that they're
actually cutting a raw...

17:42.259 --> 17:44.861
You know what,
that's a terrible analogy.

17:44.863 --> 17:46.562
Next question.

17:46.564 --> 17:51.199
Do we have to
dispose of... the bodies?

17:51.201 --> 17:54.670
Oh, God, no, that would...
That would be disgusting.

17:54.672 --> 17:56.771
The coroner actually removes the
bodies before we even get there

17:56.773 --> 18:01.212
but sometimes
they do leave behind... pieces.

18:02.747 --> 18:04.380
Uh...

18:04.382 --> 18:06.782
This may be super obvious,

18:06.784 --> 18:09.251
but if we're
dealing with a murder scene,

18:09.253 --> 18:13.288
how sure are we
that they're gone?

18:13.290 --> 18:16.592
Oh, the coroner
removes them usually before we...

18:16.594 --> 18:17.893
No, sorry.

18:17.895 --> 18:19.594
Uh, I meant,

18:19.596 --> 18:24.767
how sure are we that the killer
is gone or apprehended?

18:24.769 --> 18:26.736
You know, I've never actually
thought about that before.

18:26.738 --> 18:27.737
That's...

18:27.739 --> 18:29.639
That's kind of scary.

18:29.641 --> 18:32.408
[eerie music]

18:32.410 --> 18:34.410
Hey, sorry I'm late.

18:34.412 --> 18:36.815
I had trouble putting
on whatever this thing is.

18:37.882 --> 18:40.516
I guess these
are just unisex then?

18:40.518 --> 18:42.587
Alton, welcome, I'm Dorian.

18:43.887 --> 18:45.188
Nice to meet you.

18:45.190 --> 18:48.494
[Dorian] All right, well,
everyone, orientation begins now.

18:49.727 --> 18:51.459
Off to your stations.

18:51.461 --> 18:55.398
Todd will answer any questions
that you have and good luck.

18:55.400 --> 18:57.503
Looking forward to
working with all of you.

18:58.836 --> 19:00.202
Mmmmm.

19:00.204 --> 19:02.540
I'll work alongside you anytime.

19:05.276 --> 19:08.443
Get up and come here for a minute.
I want to talk to you guys, come on.

19:08.445 --> 19:10.278
Get up! Let's go.

19:10.280 --> 19:13.519
[somber synthesizer music]

19:17.622 --> 19:19.224
Guys, just line up over there.

19:20.391 --> 19:21.793
Come on, let's go.

19:24.429 --> 19:26.495
All right, guys, listen up.

19:26.497 --> 19:27.863
I want to be real
clear when we say this,

19:27.865 --> 19:30.665
when Dorian isn't around,
I'm the boss.

19:30.667 --> 19:32.735
You understand me?
When Dorian is off the floor,

19:32.737 --> 19:34.840
do not make eye contact with me.

19:35.772 --> 19:37.373
This is a dangerous job.

19:37.375 --> 19:39.475
I can't have
anyone fucking around

19:39.477 --> 19:41.509
because if one of you
all does some dumb shit,

19:41.511 --> 19:43.478
you put everyone else at risk.

19:43.480 --> 19:44.814
Did you just fucking look at me?

19:44.816 --> 19:46.315
Yes, sir, no, sir.

19:46.317 --> 19:47.315
Is Dorian here right now?

19:47.317 --> 19:48.617
I don't think so.

19:48.619 --> 19:50.553
Then why the fuck
are you looking at me?

19:50.555 --> 19:51.423
Okay.

19:52.656 --> 19:54.890
Want to welcome all
you guys to the team.

19:54.892 --> 19:55.991
On this team we
do not wear our name

19:55.993 --> 19:57.459
on the back of a jersey

19:57.461 --> 20:00.462
but we do wear it on
a paycheck every Friday.

20:00.464 --> 20:01.730
What the fuck is
that around your neck?

20:01.732 --> 20:03.766
It's a pagan necklace.

20:03.768 --> 20:06.268
- I'm a Wiccan.
- You mean like a witch?

20:06.270 --> 20:10.338
Hedge witch, actually. I mean, it's more of a
spiritual thing anyway. I mean, I'm fine...

20:10.340 --> 20:12.874
I'm gonna stop you right there.
We got a lot of videos to watch today.

20:12.876 --> 20:16.981
You guys get comfortable,
we're going to be here a while.

20:21.318 --> 20:22.517
[bottles clattering]

20:22.519 --> 20:23.686

[door thudding]

20:36.667 --> 20:39.370
[ominous music]

20:46.344 --> 20:48.411
There really isn't a gentle way

20:48.413 --> 20:51.080
for me to tell you this,
Mrs. Garrison, but...

20:51.082 --> 20:52.681
We can clean the...

20:52.683 --> 20:56.084
your son from the walls but...

20:56.086 --> 20:57.288
The....

20:58.088 --> 21:00.355
We will have to
remove the carpet.

21:00.357 --> 21:01.792
Oh. Uh...

21:02.460 --> 21:03.459
It's quite all right.

21:03.461 --> 21:04.863
I understand.

21:05.762 --> 21:09.300
I don't know if
the coroner told you or not but

21:10.734 --> 21:11.802
it was suicide.

21:14.439 --> 21:15.671
Jeremy...

21:15.673 --> 21:19.443
Jeremy always did
have great imagination.

21:20.877 --> 21:22.880
Yes, I can see
that all over the wall.

21:24.048 --> 21:25.046
Oh, no!

21:25.048 --> 21:26.114
Oh, I am so sorry.

21:26.116 --> 21:28.417
No, I meant the drawings.

21:28.419 --> 21:30.052
Your son was an amazing artist.

21:30.054 --> 21:32.020
[door creaking]

21:32.022 --> 21:33.024
Boss, you in here?

21:34.525 --> 21:35.560
Yes, we're in here.

21:37.260 --> 21:39.961
So glad you could make it. I'm so surprised
you're able to show up on the second day.

21:39.963 --> 21:41.430
[Sarah groaning]

21:41.432 --> 21:42.731
[somber synthesizer music]

21:42.733 --> 21:44.632
I'm fine.

21:44.634 --> 21:47.436
[Dorian] I am so sorry. I
should've called out a warning.

21:47.438 --> 21:49.372
Yeah. I'm okay.

21:49.374 --> 21:50.506
So,

21:50.508 --> 21:52.044
what've we got here?

21:54.112 --> 21:55.978
It was a shotgun suicide.

21:55.980 --> 21:57.046
And I'll be honest,

21:57.048 --> 22:00.015
shotgun kills are the worst.

22:00.017 --> 22:00.949
It's the skull
and the brain matter.

22:00.951 --> 22:03.719
The shit gets
everywhere and jobs like this,

22:03.721 --> 22:05.891
we have to be sure
to get every last piece.

22:07.392 --> 22:08.891
Does this bother you at all?

22:08.893 --> 22:10.992
Oh. No, actually.

22:10.994 --> 22:12.995
No, it's not that bad.

22:12.997 --> 22:14.462
I have a boy, so...

22:14.464 --> 22:16.431
A little muck, I'm used to it.

22:16.433 --> 22:18.401
[Sarah chuckling]

22:18.403 --> 22:19.535
Thank you for doing this.

22:19.537 --> 22:20.872
I know it's not an easy job.

22:22.038 --> 22:24.006
Did you see

33:19.762 --> 33:21.430
Yeah, get this, get this.

33:21.432 --> 33:23.597
When we found him,
he's laid out, he's laid out,

33:23.599 --> 33:26.168
he looked fine, he
looked like he was still alive,

33:26.170 --> 33:28.170
except one little detail.

33:28.172 --> 33:30.072
His dick is in his mouth

33:30.074 --> 33:32.373
and I'm not talking
about no Ron Jeremy thing,

33:32.375 --> 33:33.775
where he's blowing himself,
you know what I mean?

33:33.777 --> 33:36.478
This was mob violence,
this was terrible.

33:36.480 --> 33:37.546
Serious violence.

33:37.548 --> 33:38.646
Oh, your ass.

33:38.648 --> 33:40.481
I shit you not, I shit you not.

33:40.483 --> 33:42.750
Tony Two Times, mob boss,

33:42.752 --> 33:44.419
he was so
pissed off at this guy,

33:44.421 --> 33:45.620
I heard it down at the station,

33:45.622 --> 33:47.622
that that's why he
cut the guy's dick off,

33:47.624 --> 33:50.225
shoved it in his
mouth because he knows

33:50.227 --> 33:52.794
we're going to come along,
we're going to find him,

33:52.796 --> 33:55.697
we're going to release the
pictures, that's what we usually do.

33:55.699 --> 33:59.334
And that way the guy's
embarrassed long after he's dead.

33:59.336 --> 34:00.501
Hmmm.

34:00.503 --> 34:02.603
We should get down to the Man
Hole Club tonight, maybe.

34:02.605 --> 34:04.605
Oh, hi.

34:04.607 --> 34:07.142
Sorry to interrupt.
I'm with crime scene cleanup.

34:07.144 --> 34:12.179
Do any of you know if Dorian
is floating around nearby?

34:12.181 --> 34:14.282
Oh yeah, he's
upstairs on the third floor.

34:14.284 --> 34:17.452
- Will be getting down here real soon.
- Okay. Thanks.

34:17.454 --> 34:20.591
[somber tempo music]

34:21.724 --> 34:24.661
[door rumbling shut]

34:25.362 --> 34:27.532
[bell ringing]

34:30.733 --> 34:32.800
Hey, Sarah, you made it.

34:32.802 --> 34:34.702
You know it.

34:34.704 --> 34:36.407
Good.

34:37.907 --> 34:38.775
Well, uhm...

34:40.376 --> 34:42.376
It's a big mess in here

34:42.378 --> 34:44.445
but it should be
a pretty painless job.

34:44.447 --> 34:46.547
It may take a few days.

34:46.550 --> 34:48.717
Did you get to
meet the forensics guys?

34:48.719 --> 34:51.753
Oh yeah. [laughing] Got to
hear all their horror stories.

34:51.755 --> 34:53.623
Yeah,
those guys have seen it all.

34:55.159 --> 34:56.556
Well, uhm...

34:56.559 --> 34:58.395
All right, guys,
let's bring it in.

34:59.596 --> 35:01.929
Hello. Yikes.

35:01.931 --> 35:04.532
Let me guess,
you don't eat meat.

35:04.534 --> 35:06.168
I don't.

35:06.170 --> 35:10.171
But a sandwich in here?

35:10.173 --> 35:11.273
Fucking vegans.

35:11.275 --> 35:12.641
Let me ask you this,

35:12.643 --> 35:14.409
if animals
didn't want to get eaten,

35:14.411 --> 35:16.414
then why are they
made out of food then?

35:20.751 --> 35:23.584
[ominous music]

35:23.586 --> 35:24.454
[Dorian] Okay, guys.

35:25.489 --> 35:27.322
If you didn't catch
it on the news last night,

35:27.324 --> 35:29.925
you might not be familiar
with the details of today's job

35:29.927 --> 35:32.226
and that's not a bad thing.

35:32.228 --> 35:33.595
It's usually none
of our business anyway

35:33.597 --> 35:35.563
but full disclosure,

35:35.565 --> 35:38.333
there have been
a lot of homicides in town.

35:38.335 --> 35:41.403
Mostly in abandoned warehouses
kind of like this one.

35:41.405 --> 35:43.737
We've cleaned
up a few ourselves.

35:43.739 --> 35:46.208
But I will inform you,
especially the new hires,

35:46.210 --> 35:48.309
that I did speak with forensics

35:48.311 --> 35:52.313
and the detectives that were
here earlier and it is safe.

35:52.315 --> 35:54.782
They chased off a couple homeless
people that were hanging around

35:54.784 --> 35:57.651
but they did a deep
dive scan of the area,

35:57.653 --> 36:00.655
didn't find any suspects,
so we're safe.

36:00.657 --> 36:04.559
Do we have any
questions? Anybody? No?

36:04.561 --> 36:05.730
Great, let's get to it.

36:07.431 --> 36:09.699
[eerie music]

36:16.806 --> 36:19.807
Hey.
I didn't mean to scary everyone

36:19.809 --> 36:21.642
at orientation the other day

36:21.644 --> 36:23.411
but serious question,

36:23.413 --> 36:26.880
how sure are we that
this place has been scrubbed

36:26.882 --> 36:29.717
of a psycho killer on the loose?

36:29.719 --> 36:32.489
I, they assure me that it's...

36:34.992 --> 36:35.927
I'll tell you what,

36:36.994 --> 36:40.362
I'll have Todd poke
around just to be sure, okay?

36:40.364 --> 36:41.695
Okay.

36:41.697 --> 36:43.465
Hey, Todd, can I borrow you?

36:43.467 --> 36:44.669
[Todd] Yo.

36:48.271 --> 36:49.838
Some of the new
hires are a little scared

36:49.840 --> 36:53.878
- just because of the nature of what happened here.
- Yeah.

36:55.045 --> 36:58.512
Would you do me a favor?
Would you just go check around?

36:58.514 --> 37:00.481
- Just make sure everything's cool?
- Serious?

37:00.483 --> 37:02.883
Man, we did this shit like
a million fucking times, man.

37:02.885 --> 37:05.920
I know, I know, but
it'll put their mind at ease.

37:05.922 --> 37:07.354
Please, take Daniel with you.

37:07.356 --> 37:08.856
Whatever you say, boss.

37:08.858 --> 37:10.391
Yo, Danic Attack,

37:10.393 --> 37:11.795
I need you, let's roll.

37:14.931 --> 37:17.635
[ominous music]

37:18.534 --> 37:21.769
Jeez, I almost forgot. Thursday
night they got two for one happy hour

37:21.771 --> 37:22.903
at the Manhole Club.

37:22.905 --> 37:24.539
We'll stop off at
JC Penny on the way.

37:24.541 --> 37:26.541
I'll get some tighty whities.

37:26.543 --> 37:28.809
Let's go, let's go,
hurry up, I got to get the car.

37:28.811 --> 37:30.577
[distant police sirens]

37:30.579 --> 37:31.880
Hey.

37:31.882 --> 37:33.514
Did you all scrub the area?

37:33.516 --> 37:34.983
Nah, did you?

37:34.985 --> 37:36.450
Fuck that shit.

37:36.452 --> 37:38.019
Twenty thousand square feet?

37:38.021 --> 37:40.021
[ominous music]

37:40.023 --> 37:41.923
So what do you think
about that new crop of freshmen?

37:41.925 --> 37:43.391
- [Todd laughing]
- Huh?

37:43.393 --> 37:44.525
- Are you fucking serious?
- Huh?

37:44.527 --> 37:47.095
A bunch of fucking losers, man.

37:47.097 --> 37:50.498
I seriously doubt any of them would last
longer than a week, to be honest with you.

37:50.500 --> 37:54.702
I know, right? Already had one of them
got... before she even stepped inside.

37:54.704 --> 37:58.740
- Fucking took off. Scared ass motherfucker.
- Good fucking riddance.

37:58.742 --> 38:00.775
- Get the fuck out.
- [Daniel grunting]

38:00.777 --> 38:02.644
- Sarah chick though.
- That's what's up.

38:02.646 --> 38:03.677
Shit.

38:03.679 --> 38:04.679
- Hold up.
- [metal cranking]

38:04.681 --> 38:08.083
- [Todd shushing]
- [eerie music]

38:08.085 --> 38:10.784
I know you heard it that time,
you had to have.

38:10.786 --> 38:13.454
All right,
look dude, I didn't hear shit.

38:13.456 --> 38:15.090
All right, you are fucking...

38:15.092 --> 38:17.358
You are fucking
freaking me out, man.

38:17.360 --> 38:20.394
My fucking anxiety
is at an all-time high.

38:20.396 --> 38:21.896
I can't do this.

38:21.898 --> 38:23.630
- For real?
- I'm serious.

38:23.632 --> 38:24.566
You're going to do this
fucking shit right now, man?

38:24.568 --> 38:26.934
Oh, shit, shit. Look.

38:26.936 --> 38:33.608
I just peed a little.
You mind if I step out?

38:33.610 --> 38:35.476
- Todd, do you mind?
- Just fucking go, man.

38:35.478 --> 38:36.543
You all right, you all right?

38:36.545 --> 38:38.146
Just see Dorian
when you get back.

38:38.148 --> 38:39.916
- Just go.
- All right. I'll let him know.

38:41.385 --> 38:44.455
- [Todd] I could have sworn I heard something.
- I'll just be over here.

38:50.126 --> 38:53.096
[Daniel laughing] I got him.

38:55.065 --> 38:57.635
I did it again.

38:59.503 --> 39:00.504
Cheers to me.

39:09.780 --> 39:12.383
[eerie music]

39:33.936 --> 39:37.771
[eerie synthesizer music]

39:52.521 --> 39:53.987
[sinister music]

39:53.989 --> 39:56.793
[banging]

39:59.728 --> 40:01.229
[Sarah] So what was...

40:01.231 --> 40:04.999
What was the worst
job you've ever had to do?

40:05.001 --> 40:06.934
Or do I even want to know?

40:06.936 --> 40:08.072
No, it's okay.

40:09.840 --> 40:10.708
Well,

40:12.641 --> 40:15.044
my worst job was my first one.

40:17.246 --> 40:18.548
It was a house fire.

40:21.485 --> 40:23.487
Thirteen year old
girl and her sister.

40:25.554 --> 40:27.588
Fire started in the kitchen.

40:27.590 --> 40:30.258
They think that
probably the youngest

40:30.260 --> 40:32.092
was trying to cook something.

40:32.094 --> 40:34.528
But instead of running outside,

40:34.530 --> 40:37.500
they went upstairs and
they got in the bathtub.

40:43.039 --> 40:43.908
You...

40:45.009 --> 40:48.242
It's kind of clever if
you think about it, you know?

40:48.244 --> 40:50.778
The way that
kids think, you know?

40:50.780 --> 40:51.649
They...

40:52.815 --> 40:55.718
I guess they thought the water
would keep the fire away.

40:56.887 --> 40:58.987
[melancholy music]

40:58.989 --> 40:59.856
But...

41:02.157 --> 41:05.994
- They were, they were boiled.
- [Sarah sighing]

41:05.996 --> 41:11.501
And the oldest was
holding her sister.

41:12.936 --> 41:16.907
Like trying, you know,
like trying to protect her.

41:22.778 --> 41:23.880
I'll never forget that.

41:25.315 --> 41:26.617
Jesus.

41:31.721 --> 41:33.923
My son is my whole world.

41:36.293 --> 41:40.061
I cannot imagine what
those parents went through

41:40.063 --> 41:41.798
to lose their
children like that.

41:44.601 --> 41:45.635
[Todd] All clear, boss.

41:48.737 --> 41:50.106
Checked the entire perimeter.

41:51.740 --> 41:52.740
[Dorian sighing]

41:52.742 --> 41:54.242
- Thank you, man.
- Oh.

41:54.244 --> 41:55.842
Daniel had to
step out for a minute.

41:55.844 --> 41:59.581
So I told him to see
you as soon as he gets back.

41:59.583 --> 42:01.117
Good luck
dealing with that shit.

42:04.186 --> 42:06.656
That's a bridge I'm going
to have to eventually burn.

42:08.692 --> 42:11.561
[sinister music]

42:16.733 --> 42:19.769

[Bob coughing]

42:28.143 --> 42:30.847
[Alton gagging]

42:32.181 --> 42:36.249
This is absolutely disgusting.

42:36.251 --> 42:39.854
The blood is
like stuck in my nose.

42:39.856 --> 42:41.923
[Alton groaning]

42:41.925 --> 42:43.090
Pro tip.

42:43.092 --> 42:44.358
Don't puke in your suit.

42:44.360 --> 42:46.126
It get all down in
the crack of your ass

42:46.128 --> 42:48.331
and then we'll have
to clean your ass off.

42:49.833 --> 42:51.065
Yeah.

42:51.067 --> 42:52.168
Good tip.

42:53.969 --> 42:56.737
Does this like get any easier?

42:56.739 --> 42:57.972
Oh hell yeah, man.

42:57.974 --> 42:59.907
- Shit gets way easier.
- [Alton] Yeah?

42:59.909 --> 43:01.775
You just got to
develop some tough skin.

43:01.777 --> 43:03.043
Like last week,

43:03.045 --> 43:05.345
found some fingers
laying on the ground,

43:05.347 --> 43:09.083
- I picked them up and I smack my ass with them shits.
- What?

43:09.085 --> 43:10.385
[Todd laughing]

43:10.387 --> 43:12.019
Tough skin, baby.

43:12.021 --> 43:13.222
That's disgusting.

43:16.726 --> 43:19.059
Could be worse.
I'll tell you what, man.

43:19.061 --> 43:20.762
I know this shit ain't easy.

43:20.764 --> 43:23.296
Go head over there in
the room with Sarah and Dorian.

43:23.298 --> 43:27.235
That's light work over there. No body
parts or guts or nothing like that.

43:27.237 --> 43:28.970
Seriously?

43:28.972 --> 43:29.840
Yeah.

43:30.974 --> 43:36.209
Todd... thanks, man. I mean it.

43:36.211 --> 43:40.447
Get your goofy-looking ass out
of here. You all right, Bob?

43:40.449 --> 43:41.715
- Yeah
- You with me?

43:41.717 --> 43:43.186
You've been awfully quiet.

43:44.920 --> 43:46.787
Did you just fucking look at me?

43:46.789 --> 43:49.793
[sinister music]

43:59.802 --> 44:02.672
[chains rattling]

44:15.150 --> 44:17.284
[metal door creaking]

44:17.286 --> 44:18.154
Hey.

44:21.925 --> 44:23.827
He just left. You're safe.

44:25.295 --> 44:26.163
For now.

44:27.496 --> 44:28.398
Are you alone?

44:30.766 --> 44:34.237
No. My crew...

44:38.208 --> 44:39.143
My crew is here.

44:41.311 --> 44:44.414
We're on a crime
scene cleanup crew.

44:45.949 --> 44:47.017
The funny thing is that

44:49.853 --> 44:51.320
the girl that left today,

44:54.423 --> 44:56.891
the new hire, she wouldn't...

44:56.893 --> 44:58.762
she wouldn't step
foot in this place.

44:59.963 --> 45:02.365
She said there was pure
evil in this motherfucker.

45:04.099 --> 45:05.235
And she was right.

45:06.202 --> 45:10.003
Fuck, man, fuck! Fuck! What
the fuck are we going to do?

45:10.005 --> 45:11.539
What's the fucking plan?

45:11.541 --> 45:14.244
[door rumbling]

[ominous tempo music]

46:11.400 --> 46:13.870
[knife thudding]

46:19.007 --> 46:19.909
Hey, Dorian!

46:21.577 --> 46:24.878
Bob said he cleared this
fucking room over here, right?

46:24.880 --> 46:26.313
[Dorian] Yeah.

46:26.315 --> 46:27.817
Well he forgot some shit.

46:30.353 --> 46:31.954
Dumb motherfucker.

46:38.327 --> 46:39.563
Hey, these are still warm.

46:53.876 --> 46:56.279
[eerie music]

46:59.181 --> 47:00.313
What the fuck?

47:00.315 --> 47:01.350
Shit.

47:03.286 --> 47:04.918
Hey, Dorian.

47:04.920 --> 47:07.889
Can I speak to you for
a second in private, please?

47:07.891 --> 47:08.826
Yeah.

47:14.130 --> 47:16.664
- verything okay?
- o, it's not.

47:16.666 --> 47:18.032
Somebody locked
the fucking door.

47:18.034 --> 47:20.635
Either
the forensics guys or Daniel.

47:20.637 --> 47:23.670
I got two bag-fulls of
shit I need to take out too, so,

47:23.672 --> 47:25.472
what do you want me to do?

47:25.474 --> 47:27.411
Just leave them
at the door for now.

47:28.610 --> 47:30.577
All right. I can do that.

47:30.579 --> 47:31.914
Hmmm.

47:33.282 --> 47:34.382
What is that?

47:34.384 --> 47:35.416
Two things.

47:35.418 --> 47:36.920
It's the only way out.

47:38.121 --> 47:39.356
[Todd] All right, okay.

47:40.289 --> 47:41.157
Two.

47:43.425 --> 47:44.360
Where is Daniel?

47:45.427 --> 47:48.929
[ominous music]

47:48.931 --> 47:50.166
I don't know,
man, he never came back.

47:52.201 --> 47:53.333
You brought the tools in, right?

47:53.335 --> 47:56.670
Yeah, yeah,
I got the tools, yeah.

47:56.672 --> 47:58.171
- Maybe he's locked outside.
- Probably.

47:58.173 --> 48:01.008
- You brought all the tools in?
- Yeah, man, yeah.

48:01.010 --> 48:03.376
I got, I'm sure of it,
sure of it. Absolutely.

48:03.378 --> 48:06.613
Find Daniel. Please.

48:06.615 --> 48:08.382
I got you.
I got you, don't worry.

48:08.384 --> 48:10.353
Alton, get the fuck over here.

48:13.222 --> 48:15.626
[eerie music]

48:16.559 --> 48:18.124
Oi!

48:18.126 --> 48:19.462
Daniel!

48:20.228 --> 48:24.231
So, what are the chances
your friend is just like

48:24.233 --> 48:25.669
messing with us?

48:26.536 --> 48:28.635
Nah, he's really not the type.

48:28.637 --> 48:30.104
Although,
I do find it hard to believe

48:30.106 --> 48:31.972
that he suffers
from panic attacks.

48:31.974 --> 48:34.441
[Alton scoffs] Panic attacks?

48:34.443 --> 48:36.577
[Alton laughing]

48:36.579 --> 48:38.278
Yeah, man, so,

48:38.280 --> 48:40.380
basically Daniel's been
known to leave several jobs

48:40.382 --> 48:42.749
because he has
these panic attacks.

48:42.751 --> 48:44.719
You, I'd believe that shit.

48:44.721 --> 48:46.052
But him, nah, man.

48:46.054 --> 48:47.657
He's been doing
this shit too long.

48:49.125 --> 48:50.494
And, really,

48:51.427 --> 48:54.128
Dorian would let him
leave if he needed to, so,

48:54.130 --> 48:55.329
I don't know why
he does it anyway.

48:55.331 --> 48:57.634
You know,
I'm a lot tougher than I look.

48:59.369 --> 49:00.501
I am.

49:00.503 --> 49:02.536
Sure thing, sweet cheeks.

49:02.538 --> 49:03.407
Tough guy.

49:04.541 --> 49:07.173
So what, Dorian is just
like the best boss ever then?

49:07.175 --> 49:09.476
He'll just let
anyone do anything they want?

49:09.478 --> 49:13.646
Not exactly but,
yeah man, Dorian is good people.

49:13.648 --> 49:16.016
He takes his job very seriously

49:16.018 --> 49:18.251
but he gives us plenty of space.

49:18.253 --> 49:21.421
So if Daniel really,
really needed to leave,

49:21.423 --> 49:22.992
he'd let him go, no problem.

49:23.659 --> 49:24.525
Problem is,

49:24.527 --> 49:26.059
is that Dorian
will stay here all night

49:26.061 --> 49:28.095
to do the job by himself.

49:28.097 --> 49:30.731
See, you would never
have to get over on him

49:30.733 --> 49:32.700
because he'd give
you anything anyways.

49:32.702 --> 49:33.670
Remember that shit.

49:35.471 --> 49:38.072
Is he single?

49:38.074 --> 49:39.373
[Todd laughing]

49:39.375 --> 49:40.510
Crazy little bastard.

49:42.711 --> 49:44.014
He is though, actually.

49:44.579 --> 49:46.449
It's not what you think though.

49:47.817 --> 49:50.316
Yeah, his wife and
son died in a car accident

49:50.318 --> 49:51.387
about seven years ago.

49:52.454 --> 49:54.588
Yeah, man, it's real fucked up.

49:54.590 --> 49:56.257
He was in the passenger seat.

49:56.259 --> 49:57.657
He survived.

49:57.659 --> 49:59.693
So he blames himself.

49:59.695 --> 50:01.528
Said that when he
regained consciousness,

50:01.530 --> 50:03.164
that he had seen
what had happened,

50:03.166 --> 50:04.034
that...

50:05.201 --> 50:06.666
Ah, never mind.

50:06.668 --> 50:07.467
What?

50:07.469 --> 50:09.702
Nah,
I don't want to depress you.

50:09.704 --> 50:11.708
Well shit, man,
now you got to tell me.

50:12.608 --> 50:14.608
You ain't going to start crying
on my shoulder and shit, are you?

50:14.610 --> 50:17.478
- Enough with the gay jokes.
- [Todd laughing]

50:17.480 --> 50:22.550
You can't break me. I've spent my entire
life dealing with alpha dicks like you.

50:22.552 --> 50:24.517
Yeah, well, just don't
go grabbing my alpha dick

50:24.519 --> 50:27.123
- and we're cool.
- Just finish the story.

50:28.356 --> 50:30.423
He said that when we woke up

50:30.425 --> 50:32.425
and seen what had
happened to his family,

50:32.427 --> 50:34.762
he knew he'd
never be happy again.

50:34.764 --> 50:39.700
So now when he is,
he feels guilty and he'd say,

50:39.702 --> 50:43.403
the most important
things in life aren't things

50:43.405 --> 50:45.409
and he learned
that shit the hard way.

50:47.309 --> 50:52.213
Yeah. Wow. [sighing]

50:52.215 --> 50:55.682
- Well, you ruined my day.
- I told you.

50:55.684 --> 50:57.487
- [metal clattering]
- I mean, wait.

50:58.420 --> 50:59.385
Did you hear that?

50:59.387 --> 51:00.257
I did.

51:01.289 --> 51:03.757
Come on, over here, this way.

51:03.759 --> 51:06.226
[ominous music]

51:06.228 --> 51:08.862
[Daniel faintly] Please,
no, no, no, no.

51:08.864 --> 51:12.468
[Daniel muffled
speaking and whimpering]

51:16.606 --> 51:17.507
What the fuck?

51:18.440 --> 51:20.141
[Daniel whimpering]

51:20.143 --> 51:21.845
Hey, Daniel, is that you?

51:23.612 --> 51:24.480
Todd.

51:25.414 --> 51:27.180
Yeah, man, fuck, fuck, fuck.

51:27.182 --> 51:29.816
I'm in here and there's
a man in here with me, Todd!

51:29.818 --> 51:31.651
Let me try and fucking
pry this door open, man!

51:31.653 --> 51:34.155
How the fuck did you
get yourself in there?

51:34.157 --> 51:36.523
Daniel,
who's the man in there with you?

51:36.525 --> 51:37.891
- You okay?
- [metal creaking]

51:37.893 --> 51:39.592
No, man, no, no, no.

51:39.594 --> 51:40.894
There's a motherfucker in here

51:40.896 --> 51:43.132
who's trying to
fucking kill us, brother!

51:43.900 --> 51:47.800
Watch your fucking back!
Get me the fuck out of here!

51:47.802 --> 51:50.237
That fucker in there
with you is trying to kill you?

51:50.239 --> 51:52.840
I got Alton with me, brother. We're going
to get you the fuck out of there, man.

51:52.842 --> 51:53.907
- Just hang in there!
- No, man, no, no.

51:53.909 --> 51:57.610
The guy, the guy in
here is being held hostage.

51:57.612 --> 51:59.746
The killer is
fucking out there with you!

51:59.748 --> 52:02.883
- [sinister music]
- He's out there with you, Todd!

52:02.885 --> 52:04.485
Alton, go warn the others.

52:04.487 --> 52:05.786
Get the sledgehammer,
it's not safe here, man.

52:05.788 --> 52:07.253
- Todd!
- Go!

52:07.255 --> 52:09.490
[gasping] I'm scared.

52:09.492 --> 52:10.858
I know but if you
don't go warn the others

52:10.860 --> 52:12.927
and the get
the fucking sledgehammer,

52:12.929 --> 52:15.164
we might all be fucked,
man. You got to go!

52:16.398 --> 52:17.965
I can't go by myself though.

52:17.967 --> 52:20.601
Earlier you told me you were
stronger than you looked, right?

52:20.603 --> 52:22.269
You told me that shit.

52:22.271 --> 52:23.637
You got to go, man, go!

52:23.639 --> 52:24.704
Go warn the others, man, go!

52:24.706 --> 52:26.941
Get the fuck out of here! Go!

52:26.943 --> 52:30.247
[suspenseful music]

52:34.317 --> 52:36.920
[metal creaking]

52:42.257 --> 52:43.557
Sarah?

52:43.559 --> 52:44.490
Dorian?

52:44.492 --> 52:45.695
Sarah, oh shit!

52:46.996 --> 52:49.463
- You were right, you were right, you were right!
- What's wrong?

52:49.465 --> 52:52.865
Daniel is trapped in a room back there
and Todd is trying to bust him out, okay?

52:52.867 --> 52:57.804
Whoever killed these people is still in
here with us. We got to get out of here!

52:57.806 --> 52:59.572
Stop, stop,
stop, stop. [shushing]

52:59.574 --> 53:01.407
Calm down, calm down,
I need you to calm down.

53:01.409 --> 53:02.443
Listen, look at me.

53:02.445 --> 53:03.943
Look at me, look at me.

53:03.945 --> 53:05.878
Where are Todd
and Daniel exactly?

53:05.880 --> 53:08.648
They're down there,
there's a room to the right.

53:08.650 --> 53:12.286
There's a red door. He wanted me
to get the sledgehammer, okay?

53:12.288 --> 53:15.322
And to warn you guys. I mean, the killer
is still walking around here with us.

53:15.324 --> 53:16.824
We need to stick together
or we're going to end up

53:16.826 --> 53:17.925
like those people
stuck in those bags!

53:17.927 --> 53:19.860
[Dorian shushing]

53:19.862 --> 53:22.896
- [Alton panting]
- We move quickly.

53:22.898 --> 53:25.499
Keep your eyes peeled for any
windows that don't have bars.

53:25.501 --> 53:27.237
- Come on. Move!
- [Sarah muffled speech]

53:28.871 --> 53:34.608
What's taking him so long? What's taking
him so long? What's taking him so long?

53:34.610 --> 53:37.911
Todd, Todd,
please, please, please.

53:37.913 --> 53:39.313
- Come back.
- Fuck.

53:39.315 --> 53:41.481
- Come back, come back.
- It's not a game.

53:41.483 --> 53:42.615
I can't fucking
break it down, man.

53:42.617 --> 53:43.983
[killer growling]

53:43.985 --> 53:46.789
[sinister music]

53:51.626 --> 53:53.327
Watch out.

53:53.329 --> 53:54.360
No, no, no, no.

53:54.362 --> 53:55.862
[eerie music]

53:55.864 --> 53:57.831
It's too loud. It's too loud.

53:57.833 --> 53:59.400
Keep it, we might need it.

53:59.402 --> 54:01.501
How the fuck does only
one entrance to this place work?

54:01.503 --> 54:02.836
It's an old building!

54:02.838 --> 54:05.905
Okay, I don't know.
Just, there's got to be another way out.

54:05.907 --> 54:07.243
There just, there has to be.

54:08.677 --> 54:09.346
I'm so sorry.

54:10.679 --> 54:11.845
- No, it's my fault.
- Dorian.

54:11.847 --> 54:13.880
I should've sent you home
when you came to me earlier.

54:13.882 --> 54:15.883
What about the...
the concrete saw?

54:15.885 --> 54:18.822
- We can use that.
- No, no, again, it's too loud.

54:19.655 --> 54:21.725
It's going to draw
too much attention to us.

54:23.326 --> 54:24.691
Look,

54:24.693 --> 54:26.730
we have to find Todd and Daniel.

54:28.431 --> 54:29.396
We stick together.

54:29.398 --> 54:30.963
Okay.

54:30.965 --> 54:32.432
[eerie music]

54:32.434 --> 54:33.302
Okay.

54:37.405 --> 54:40.009
[menacing music]

54:53.021 --> 54:54.123
Must be Todd's flashlight.

54:57.460 --> 55:00.362
You want me to go investigate
or do you want to go, Alton?

55:01.063 --> 55:03.530
I'm not going to leave Sarah.

55:03.532 --> 55:06.467
It's okay. That's all right,
it's okay, it's okay.

55:06.469 --> 55:08.901
It's all right. Okay.

55:08.903 --> 55:10.306
I'm going to go check it out.

55:11.440 --> 55:13.840
If it's safe, give a shout,
give some kind of signal

55:13.842 --> 55:15.541
without drawing
too much attention.

55:15.543 --> 55:17.547
If you hear
anything different, you run.

55:18.447 --> 55:19.316
Just run.

55:21.717 --> 55:22.585
Don't.

55:24.519 --> 55:26.653
It's all right.

55:26.655 --> 55:27.657
It'll be all right.

55:29.391 --> 55:31.157
- Okay?
- [ominous music]

55:31.159 --> 55:32.027
It's okay.

55:33.528 --> 55:34.762
Be careful.

55:34.764 --> 55:37.367
[eerie music]

55:44.706 --> 55:45.641
Todd?

[unsettling music]

55:51.746 --> 55:53.447
Oh.

56:21.844 --> 56:25.512
We can stay in here
until we get a plan, okay?

56:25.514 --> 56:26.383
Yeah.

56:27.550 --> 56:28.418
Agreed.

56:29.851 --> 56:33.119
So, what're we going to do?

56:33.121 --> 56:35.054
I don't know.

56:35.056 --> 56:36.725
I don't know but...

56:37.960 --> 56:40.494
I'm going to push through, okay?

56:40.496 --> 56:41.164
For my son,

56:42.530 --> 56:43.400
for you,

we're going to make it.

[suspenseful tempo music]

01:08:30.404 --> 01:08:31.538
Don't move!

01:08:34.341 --> 01:08:35.210
Sarah!

01:08:36.609 --> 01:08:38.247
- Alton.
- Sarah!

01:08:39.180 --> 01:08:40.446
Damn it!

01:08:40.448 --> 01:08:42.482
[suspenseful music]

01:08:42.484 --> 01:08:45.451
The Lord is my shepherd,

01:08:45.453 --> 01:08:47.586
I shall not want.

01:08:47.587 --> 01:08:50.189
He maketh me to lie
down in green pastures,

01:08:50.192 --> 01:08:52.394
He leadeth me
beside the still waters.

01:08:53.461 --> 01:08:56.495
- He restoreth my soul.
- [eerie music]

01:08:56.497 --> 01:08:58.630
He leadeth me in
the path of righteousness

01:08:58.631 --> 01:09:00.200
for His name's sake.

01:09:00.202 --> 01:09:01.170
Ah.

01:09:02.703 --> 01:09:04.336
Now that part
wasn't so bad, was it?

01:09:04.337 --> 01:09:06.371
...the valley of
the shadow of death,

01:09:06.372 --> 01:09:08.674
- I will fear no evil.
- You know, I've discovered

01:09:08.676 --> 01:09:12.745
that often times, the fear of
death is scarier than death itself.

01:09:12.747 --> 01:09:14.714
[victim] Thy rod and
thy staff they comfort me.

01:09:14.716 --> 01:09:16.482
Most people that
I've killed seem...

01:09:16.484 --> 01:09:18.384
[victim] Thou preparest a table
before me in the presence...

01:09:18.386 --> 01:09:20.687
- ...at peace.
- ...of mine enemies.

01:09:20.689 --> 01:09:22.691
- Thou anointest my head...
- But for this one,

01:09:24.292 --> 01:09:26.593
- it's going to hurt...
- [victim] My cup runneth over.

01:09:26.595 --> 01:09:28.527
- ...Very badly.
- Surely goodness and mercy...

01:09:28.529 --> 01:09:33.532
- So I want you to just... relax.
- [victim praying and crying]

01:09:33.533 --> 01:09:35.634
No, no. [shushing]

01:09:35.636 --> 01:09:36.738
- Relax.
- ...runneth over.

01:09:38.439 --> 01:09:40.439
Surely goodness
and mercy will follow me

01:09:40.442 --> 01:09:42.741
- all the days of my life.
- [machine cranking]

01:09:42.743 --> 01:09:45.345

[killer laughing]

01:09:56.557 --> 01:09:58.924
Oh, that was fantastic!

01:09:58.926 --> 01:09:59.929
I never expected,

01:10:01.029 --> 01:10:02.361
whoosh!

01:10:02.363 --> 01:10:04.496
[killer chuckling]

[eerie music]

01:10:07.601 --> 01:10:09.936
[sobbing]
Why are you doing this?

01:10:09.938 --> 01:10:12.208
Oh, why, why,
why, why, why, why?

01:10:13.307 --> 01:10:14.443
Do I need a reason?

01:10:16.344 --> 01:10:19.748
I am the punishment of God.

01:10:21.315 --> 01:10:22.882
If you had not
committed great sins,

01:10:22.884 --> 01:10:26.518
God would not have sent
a punishment like me upon you.

01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:27.954
Okay, okay,
look, please, please.

01:10:27.956 --> 01:10:30.055
Look, I can,
I can make this right.

01:10:30.057 --> 01:10:31.723
I can clean all this up, okay?

01:10:31.725 --> 01:10:34.696
Let me ask you a question.

01:10:35.829 --> 01:10:39.965
Who is going to come
and clean your body up?

01:10:39.967 --> 01:10:43.505
[suspenseful beat music]

01:10:50.011 --> 01:10:52.314
I remember when
I was a little boy.

01:10:53.347 --> 01:10:54.617
I would say to myself,

01:10:55.550 --> 01:10:56.485
"Oh,

01:10:57.351 --> 01:10:58.720
that girl is very pretty.

01:11:00.055 --> 01:11:01.789
I'd love to see her insides."

01:11:02.923 --> 01:11:04.624
I just never
thought anything of it.

01:11:04.626 --> 01:11:07.695
It was normal. Huh?

01:11:08.662 --> 01:11:11.532
It is like with you,
right here, right now.

01:11:13.033 --> 01:11:15.036
I really just want
to cut out your spine.

01:11:16.003 --> 01:11:18.638
[chainsaw buzzing]

01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:21.677
[Sarah screaming]

01:11:23.877 --> 01:11:27.347
[Sarah whimpering]

01:11:27.349 --> 01:11:29.081
- Good job.
- [Sarah gagging]

01:11:29.083 --> 01:11:31.817
- I'm so glad you came.
- [Sarah gasping]

01:11:31.819 --> 01:11:35.620
Keeps me from having to hunt
you down, to try to find you.

01:11:35.622 --> 01:11:36.858
It's too much work.

01:11:38.126 --> 01:11:40.393
Now, can I ask you a favor?

01:11:40.395 --> 01:11:42.464
Can you stay here
for just one second?

01:11:43.465 --> 01:11:47.970
Because if you don't, I'm going to punch
your nose through the back of your head.

01:11:49.371 --> 01:11:51.739
[Sarah gasping] Alton.

01:11:53.742 --> 01:11:56.442
- You piece of shit!
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

01:11:56.444 --> 01:11:59.848
No, you cannot speak the queen's
tongue in this profanity.

01:12:01.649 --> 01:12:02.651
Wait.

01:12:04.085 --> 01:12:05.785
Is he your...

01:12:05.787 --> 01:12:07.486
No.

01:12:07.488 --> 01:12:09.655
- He cannot be.
- [Sarah gasping]

01:12:09.657 --> 01:12:10.893
He's your husband?

01:12:11.859 --> 01:12:13.025
Well,

01:12:13.027 --> 01:12:15.564
it appears he is still alive.

01:12:16.597 --> 01:12:19.699
- Eh, he's barely alive.
- [Sarah crying]

01:12:19.701 --> 01:12:23.503
You know, I've read
about forensic pathologists

01:12:23.505 --> 01:12:26.738
describing when
rigor mortis sets in.

01:12:26.740 --> 01:12:28.840
Often times on
the autopsy table,

01:12:28.842 --> 01:12:31.943
dead bodies will
rise to their elbows

01:12:31.945 --> 01:12:33.015
and almost sit up.

01:12:34.082 --> 01:12:35.714
I've always found that so...

01:12:35.716 --> 01:12:38.686
[Alton gasping]

01:12:40.587 --> 01:12:43.188
- Wait.
- [Alton gasping]

01:12:43.190 --> 01:12:45.625
You are going to say something?

01:12:45.627 --> 01:12:47.759
After all of that?

01:12:47.761 --> 01:12:49.795
Oh, I simply must
hear what you need to say

01:12:49.797 --> 01:12:51.830
at this very moment.

01:12:51.832 --> 01:12:53.766
I'll never leave you...

01:12:53.768 --> 01:12:56.038
I'll never leave you, Sarah.

01:12:56.970 --> 01:12:59.004
[Sarah crying]

01:12:59.006 --> 01:13:01.641
That was beautiful.

01:13:01.643 --> 01:13:03.809
That was so beautiful.

01:13:03.811 --> 01:13:05.111
He's lying.

01:13:05.113 --> 01:13:06.044
No!

01:13:06.046 --> 01:13:08.481
[suspenseful music]

01:13:08.483 --> 01:13:09.150
No!

[metal scraping]

01:13:15.122 --> 01:13:16.621
- [machete thudding]
- No!

01:13:16.623 --> 01:13:18.924
[sinister music]

01:13:18.926 --> 01:13:19.961
No!

[killer grunting]

01:13:23.198 --> 01:13:25.901
[Sarah sobbing]

01:13:28.036 --> 01:13:29.037
I did him a favor.

01:13:30.671 --> 01:13:33.408
I stopped him from seeing
what was going to happen to you.

01:13:34.208 --> 01:13:35.077
In my opinion,

01:13:36.578 --> 01:13:37.813
you should be thanking me.

01:13:39.012 --> 01:13:40.047
Now let me ask you,

01:13:41.114 --> 01:13:44.619
is there anyone else
running around in my mortuary?

01:13:45.153 --> 01:13:48.019
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!

01:13:48.021 --> 01:13:50.559
Shit, shit, shit. Fuck!

01:13:51.693 --> 01:13:55.628
Fuck! Hey, you! You, you, you!

01:13:55.630 --> 01:13:57.763
You, come, come, come over here!
Come here!

01:13:57.765 --> 01:13:59.165
Come here, shit!

01:13:59.167 --> 01:14:01.970
[sinister music]

01:14:04.838 --> 01:14:07.509

[suspenseful music]

01:14:14.082 --> 01:14:14.950
Ugh.

01:14:16.150 --> 01:14:19.951
Now I'm going to have to hunt
her down and try to find her.

01:14:19.953 --> 01:14:22.056
I told you before,
it's too much work.

01:14:23.024 --> 01:14:25.691
[Daniel whimpering]

01:14:25.693 --> 01:14:26.662
Once you stop...

01:14:29.898 --> 01:14:32.467
I'm going to give you
an honorable death, hm?

01:14:33.067 --> 01:14:34.866
Something of fancy, yeah?

01:14:34.868 --> 01:14:37.303
Is that how you exercise?

01:14:37.305 --> 01:14:39.942
I may incorporate that
into my morning routine.

01:14:40.942 --> 01:14:42.174
[suspenseful music]

[Sarah groaning]

01:14:49.016 --> 01:14:52.151
Oh no! Oh, no, no!

01:14:52.153 --> 01:14:53.989
It's really quite clever.

[killer laughing]

01:15:02.930 --> 01:15:04.129
I got you, I got you, I got you!

01:15:04.131 --> 01:15:05.132
I got you!

01:15:06.067 --> 01:15:08.634
I'm going to
have to hurt you back.

01:15:08.636 --> 01:15:11.740
[suspenseful music]

[killer sighing]

01:15:25.185 --> 01:15:27.088
This does not feel right at all.

01:15:28.823 --> 01:15:30.726
I can't even do
anything fancy to him.

01:15:32.993 --> 01:15:36.661
But you, oh,

01:15:36.663 --> 01:15:37.532
your leg.

01:15:39.167 --> 01:15:42.104
You know, I never actually
got anyone in the trap before.

01:15:43.637 --> 01:15:46.574
[ominous music]

01:15:48.141 --> 01:15:49.842
Congratulations.

01:15:49.844 --> 01:15:52.745
[Sarah gasping]

01:15:52.747 --> 01:15:53.615
Oh.

01:15:54.881 --> 01:15:55.983
It is a wicked wound.

01:15:58.152 --> 01:15:59.121
I bet it hurts.

01:16:00.188 --> 01:16:01.923
I also have an injured leg.

01:16:02.923 --> 01:16:06.258
Your friend over there,
he may have cut off my big toe.

01:16:06.260 --> 01:16:07.727
I haven't checked

01:16:07.729 --> 01:16:09.861
but I can feel one
of my little piggies,

01:16:09.863 --> 01:16:11.799
it's rolling around in my boot.

01:16:13.201 --> 01:16:14.967
I just hope it's not
one of the little piggies

01:16:14.969 --> 01:16:20.305
that were supposed to go
to the market, you know? Hmmm?

01:16:20.307 --> 01:16:22.144
What is wrong with you?

01:16:24.645 --> 01:16:26.347
Who are you?

01:16:29.283 --> 01:16:30.152
I...

01:16:31.819 --> 01:16:32.888
am everyone.

01:16:34.956 --> 01:16:36.658
I can walk
amongst people in a crowd

01:16:38.292 --> 01:16:39.628
and go unnoticed.

01:16:41.962 --> 01:16:43.931
I am no different than you.

01:16:46.701 --> 01:16:48.733
It is a shame that your actions

01:16:48.735 --> 01:16:50.771
don't dictate your appearance.

01:16:51.706 --> 01:16:52.708
Some people,

01:16:54.942 --> 01:16:57.244
they would call me a monster.

01:16:58.179 --> 01:17:00.178
But could you pick
me out from a crowd?

01:17:00.180 --> 01:17:02.147
[Sarah gasping]

01:17:02.149 --> 01:17:03.085
Bullshit!

01:17:04.886 --> 01:17:07.986
Why? Why?

01:17:07.988 --> 01:17:09.722
Why, why, why, why, why, why?

01:17:09.724 --> 01:17:10.626
Why?

01:17:12.060 --> 01:17:12.928
Somewhere

01:17:14.194 --> 01:17:15.861
someone is
praying to have the things

01:17:15.863 --> 01:17:19.134
that you take
for granted every day.

01:17:20.301 --> 01:17:23.405
Food, drink, work, love.

01:17:25.739 --> 01:17:30.045
Every animal in
nature that eats meat, kills.

01:17:31.912 --> 01:17:32.813
Even you.

01:17:35.783 --> 01:17:37.252
I don't eat meat,

01:17:38.819 --> 01:17:40.021
I don't kill

01:17:41.021 --> 01:17:44.290
and I don't take
anything for granted.

01:17:44.292 --> 01:17:45.694
Is that so?

01:17:48.895 --> 01:17:51.863
I do this because I like it.

01:17:51.865 --> 01:17:53.034
And like you,

01:17:53.967 --> 01:17:55.403
cleaning up crime scenes,

01:17:57.337 --> 01:18:00.274
sometimes you
actually have to forget

01:18:01.975 --> 01:18:03.210
that they are real people.

01:18:04.377 --> 01:18:06.111
I have a son.

01:18:06.113 --> 01:18:08.214
I have a son, Shepard.

01:18:08.216 --> 01:18:10.382
Please, I don't want him
to grow up without a mother.

01:18:10.384 --> 01:18:12.852
- I don't want him to. Please don't.
- [killer shushing]

He grew up as an orphan.

01:18:23.430 --> 01:18:24.899
Your boy will be fine.

01:18:26.501 --> 01:18:27.933
Unless he meets me.

No!
