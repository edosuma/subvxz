WEBVTT

00:02.001 --> 00:02.836
Lily Anne Lonergan?
 Your ex-bandmate

00:02.870 --> 00:04.372
who used to be
 in love with you?

00:04.405 --> 00:05.306
I missed one
little show.

00:05.339 --> 00:07.475
That show was my
sister's wedding.

00:07.508 --> 00:08.576
Run from Wade.

00:08.609 --> 00:09.810
You can hear
further instructions

00:09.843 --> 00:11.379
in my song, "Run from Wade."

00:11.412 --> 00:12.780
Wait, that was about me?

00:12.813 --> 00:14.582
Jonah Breeland.
Breeland.

00:14.615 --> 00:15.783
Mm-hmm.
There's more of them.

00:15.816 --> 00:17.218
Yeah, this is Brick's nephew.

00:17.251 --> 00:18.252
When did you get into football?

00:18.286 --> 00:19.553
I am into Max Berges.

00:19.587 --> 00:21.689
Victory party at Teddy's
house. You should come.

00:21.722 --> 00:23.357
Oh, my God.

00:23.391 --> 00:24.658
I know that you
left the bar last night

00:24.692 --> 00:25.759
with another woman.

00:25.793 --> 00:27.795
Her battery was dead.
She said she needed a jump.

00:27.828 --> 00:30.331
Something could've
happened, but it didn't.

00:30.364 --> 00:32.066
Did you talk to Wade
about the other night?

00:32.100 --> 00:34.135
Nothing happened with that girl.
Her battery just died.

00:34.168 --> 00:35.136
I've heard the one

00:35.169 --> 00:37.538
about the girl
with the dead battery before.

00:37.571 --> 00:39.607
Tansy, what are you saying?

00:39.640 --> 00:41.275
The other day,
when you asked me,

00:41.309 --> 00:43.111
I wanted to pretend
it didn't happen.

00:43.144 --> 00:46.314
I was drunk,
and I was in a dark place.

00:47.548 --> 00:49.250
Please forgive me.

00:53.287 --> 00:55.289
*

00:56.490 --> 00:58.492
(phone ringing)

01:03.564 --> 01:05.566
(phone continues ringing)

01:11.205 --> 01:13.807
Dr. Hart, it's Dr. Breeland.

01:13.841 --> 01:16.444
You've been out for six days.

01:16.477 --> 01:20.614
I realize you've had a setback,
but four patients have died.

01:23.584 --> 01:24.752
(beep)

01:24.785 --> 01:26.687
Honey, it's Sheila.

01:26.720 --> 01:29.290
We all read what happened
on Dash's blog.

01:29.323 --> 01:31.325
It's absolutely horrifying.

01:31.359 --> 01:32.460
(beep)

01:32.493 --> 01:34.595
GIRL:
It's a tragedy, is what it is.

01:34.628 --> 01:37.231
Which is why I made you a pie.

01:37.265 --> 01:38.065
(beep)

01:38.098 --> 01:40.468
MAN:
Z, at least come in the kitchen.

01:40.501 --> 01:42.503
There's coffee.

01:42.536 --> 01:45.473
Also, I'm about to get your
house tented for termites, so...

01:45.506 --> 01:47.341
(sighs)

01:57.518 --> 02:01.422
Hey, uh, I thought you had
already left for work, so...

02:01.455 --> 02:03.691
No, um, not yet.

02:03.724 --> 02:05.659
LAVON:
Hey, Zoe, you finally

02:05.693 --> 02:07.328
made it out of the hou...

02:08.395 --> 02:10.231
I was just, uh, getting...
I need to get...

02:10.264 --> 02:11.332
coffee.
coffee.

02:12.233 --> 02:13.234
Well, uh, come on,

02:13.267 --> 02:14.568
we'll go
to the Rammer Jammer

02:14.602 --> 02:16.804
and get some.

02:16.837 --> 02:20.541
Well, uh, I'm actually
going to work right now,

02:20.574 --> 02:23.377
at the Rammer Jammer, so...

02:23.411 --> 02:25.179
I would be the one

02:25.213 --> 02:27.348
getting you coffee.

02:27.381 --> 02:29.550
We'll stay here.

02:29.583 --> 02:32.286
Good talk.

02:35.356 --> 02:37.425
(sighs)

02:40.694 --> 02:41.795
Magnolia, I'm here.

02:41.829 --> 02:42.930
Hey, Lemon.

02:42.963 --> 02:44.565
(gasps)
Oh, God, Shelby.

02:44.598 --> 02:46.867
What are you doing
crawling around on the floor?

02:46.900 --> 02:48.736
I'm helping your
dad buy a new rug.

02:48.769 --> 02:50.438
As a professional
organizer,

02:50.471 --> 02:51.605
I also dabble
in home dÃ©cor,

02:51.639 --> 02:53.607
and I thought the place could
use a little spruce-up.

02:53.641 --> 02:55.843
There are some things in here
that have really got to go.

02:56.977 --> 02:59.347
Yes, there are some things

02:59.380 --> 03:02.516
in this house right now
I would just love to get rid of.

03:02.550 --> 03:03.884
(laughs)

03:03.917 --> 03:05.953
But while I appreciate
your good intentions,

03:05.986 --> 03:08.922
this rug has been in our
family for over 100 years.

03:08.956 --> 03:10.758
My great-grandmother Vera
picked it out.

03:10.791 --> 03:12.960
Well, I don't want to
kick Vera to the curb,

03:12.993 --> 03:15.429
but maybe she'd be
happier in the den.

03:15.463 --> 03:17.831
MAGNOLIA: Oh, Lemon,
thank God you're here.

03:17.865 --> 03:19.300
Shelby wants
to take me to school,

03:19.333 --> 03:21.702
and I'd rather
set myself on fire.

03:21.735 --> 03:23.804
Oh, well,
we're all here.

03:23.837 --> 03:24.905
Sorry, I didn't see you.

03:24.938 --> 03:27.275
Your head's
the color of the wall.

03:27.308 --> 03:28.509
LEMON:
Magnolia Breeland,

03:28.542 --> 03:29.577
where are your manners?

03:29.610 --> 03:30.844
I cannot believe
that you called

03:30.878 --> 03:32.546
and asked me to
take you to school

03:32.580 --> 03:34.982
when Shelby so generously
offered to take you herself.

03:35.015 --> 03:37.318
Shelby, I am so sorry.

03:37.351 --> 03:38.652
I apologize
for my sister's behavior.

03:38.686 --> 03:40.354
Oh, well, we all wake up

03:40.388 --> 03:42.590
on the wrong side
of the bed sometimes.

03:45.359 --> 03:46.827
What are you doing?

03:46.860 --> 03:47.895
What are you doing?

03:47.928 --> 03:50.564
I thought the goal
was to get her out of our lives.

03:50.598 --> 03:51.565
It is.

03:51.599 --> 03:52.700
But in case you
haven't noticed,

03:52.733 --> 03:55.469
Daddy and Shelby came back
from their vacation early.

03:55.503 --> 03:56.604
So?

03:56.637 --> 03:58.406
So, clearly,

03:58.439 --> 04:00.741
after spending
two weeks alone with Shelby,

04:00.774 --> 04:02.042
Daddy is finally
seeing the light

04:02.075 --> 04:03.477
on just how annoying she is.

04:03.511 --> 04:05.012
The best plan

04:05.045 --> 04:06.347
is to just give Shelby

04:06.380 --> 04:07.548
enough rope to
hang herself with.

04:07.581 --> 04:09.483
Well, she better
hang herself soon,

04:09.517 --> 04:13.287
'cause the wrong side of the bed
is the only side my bed has.

04:18.392 --> 04:20.793
Shame on you
for hurting our sweet Zoe.

04:20.827 --> 04:22.530
She cured my eczema.

04:22.563 --> 04:24.632
Don't know a good thing
when you have it.

04:24.665 --> 04:26.934
Bad, bad man.

04:32.773 --> 04:33.941
Hey, Tucker, how's it going?

04:33.974 --> 04:36.744
Well, you lied to my face.

04:36.777 --> 04:40.448
So I guess
that's how it's going.

04:42.583 --> 04:44.385
You are too good
for Wade anyway.

04:44.418 --> 04:45.919
You're much better off
without him.

04:45.953 --> 04:47.588
You could use
the extra time

04:47.621 --> 04:49.523
to do something
with that hair.

04:49.557 --> 04:50.791
Aw.

04:50.824 --> 04:52.493
Thank you.

04:52.526 --> 04:54.695
I've never been surrounded
by more calories.

04:54.728 --> 04:56.464
(laughter)

04:56.497 --> 04:57.798
Okay, let's give her
some space, now.

04:57.831 --> 04:58.966
Oh, sure.

05:00.668 --> 05:02.803
Everybody's just happy
to see you out and about.

05:02.836 --> 05:04.505
You know, they've been
holding onto these pies

05:04.538 --> 05:06.607
for, like, a week now.

05:06.640 --> 05:07.641
How are you?

05:07.675 --> 05:08.909
Sad.

05:08.942 --> 05:10.578
How am I supposed
to feel better

05:10.611 --> 05:12.680
when everywhere I look
holds a memory?

05:12.713 --> 05:14.382
Or a person with pie.

05:14.415 --> 05:15.483
Hey, Zoe.

05:15.516 --> 05:16.984
Hey.
Hey, uh...

05:17.017 --> 05:19.052
I know you're going through
a rough time right now.

05:19.086 --> 05:21.655
If there's anything I can do,
like... like punch Wade,

05:21.689 --> 05:23.957
or have Tansy
punch Wade again,

05:23.991 --> 05:25.626
or have anyone at all
punch Wade...

05:25.659 --> 05:27.628
I realize now
that all my ideas

05:27.661 --> 05:30.931
involve punching Wade,
but I can work on others.

05:30.964 --> 05:33.033
Thank you, George.
That is very sweet.

05:34.735 --> 05:36.737
All right, then.

05:39.607 --> 05:40.808
No pie.
(chuckles)

05:40.841 --> 05:44.044
You know what,
I'm going to work.

05:44.077 --> 05:45.546
Taking care of others

05:45.579 --> 05:48.682
might help me forget
my own problems for a while.

05:48.716 --> 05:50.951
Hey, heard you got dumped.

05:50.984 --> 05:54.054
You want to know what helps
get over those break-up blues?

05:54.087 --> 05:56.857
Mind-blowing sex
with a really hot doctor.

05:56.890 --> 05:59.126
Oh, man, if only I knew one,
I would give it a shot.

05:59.159 --> 06:00.160
Why are you here?

06:00.193 --> 06:01.562
Just finished
two grueling weeks

06:01.595 --> 06:02.730
of applying
for a surgical fellowship.

06:02.763 --> 06:03.964
You may remember that.

06:03.997 --> 06:05.933
Mm-hmm.
So, anyways,
just thought I'd catch

06:05.966 --> 06:08.001
some BlueBell R and R
and lend Brick a hand.

06:08.035 --> 06:09.403
Oh, Dr. Hart.

06:09.437 --> 06:10.904
So, glad you could
join us before lunch.

06:10.938 --> 06:14.775
There are patients
with needs and, oddly, pies.

06:14.808 --> 06:16.143
ZOE:
Okay, this is...

06:16.176 --> 06:18.011
not the escape
that I was looking for.

06:18.045 --> 06:20.113
Jonah, would you mind
covering for me? Thank you.

06:21.482 --> 06:23.717
More pie for us.

06:23.751 --> 06:25.052
You're in a really good mood.

06:25.085 --> 06:26.954
What's going on?

06:26.987 --> 06:28.155
Well, since you ask,

06:28.188 --> 06:29.757
Shelby and I had the most

06:29.790 --> 06:31.725
amazing two weeks
in New Orleans.

06:31.759 --> 06:33.494
So good,
we came home early

06:33.527 --> 06:34.762
so I could tell the girls

06:34.795 --> 06:36.196
I want Shelby to move in.

06:36.229 --> 06:38.799
Then you better enjoy
those pies while you can

06:38.832 --> 06:40.033
because, once
you tell Lemon,

06:40.067 --> 06:41.769
you're going to be
eating through a straw.

06:41.802 --> 06:43.637
No, I already
thought about that.

06:43.671 --> 06:45.072
I've got a plan.

06:47.741 --> 06:49.076
(knocking on door)

06:49.109 --> 06:51.479
Got a present for you.

06:57.851 --> 06:59.086
Figured it might be best

06:59.119 --> 07:01.655
for you to use this
for the time being.

07:01.689 --> 07:03.691
It'll solve our
kitchen traffic problem.

07:03.724 --> 07:04.792
Look, I get it, all right?

07:04.825 --> 07:05.793
I'm the town pariah.

07:05.826 --> 07:07.495
I will keep out
of your kitchen,

07:07.528 --> 07:09.530
and I'll keep
out of your way.
(bicycle bell rings)

07:09.563 --> 07:11.532
Hey, just the guys
I was looking for.

07:11.565 --> 07:13.867
Reverend Mayfair,
what brings you out here?

07:13.901 --> 07:15.002
Just reminding all my volunteers

07:15.035 --> 07:16.136
about the church
casino fund-raiser.

07:16.169 --> 07:19.006
I decided to put
you two in charge.

07:19.039 --> 07:20.941
Uh, about that...
Well, actually, I-I...

07:20.974 --> 07:23.477
No, no, no, no, now, look,
you can't say no, okay?

07:23.511 --> 07:25.946
The idea was revealed
to me in a vision.

07:25.979 --> 07:27.080
(laughing)

07:27.114 --> 07:28.215
(rings bell)

07:28.248 --> 07:30.150
Goes to that well a lot.

07:30.183 --> 07:32.185
(sighs)

07:38.291 --> 07:39.727
(dog barks)

07:39.760 --> 07:41.094
Zoe?

07:41.128 --> 07:42.129
How you doing?

07:42.162 --> 07:43.230
Please don't have pie.

07:43.263 --> 07:44.932
Oh, my God, the pity pies.

07:44.965 --> 07:46.500
I got a ton to help me

07:46.534 --> 07:47.735
after the breakup
with Wade.

07:47.768 --> 07:48.836
Plus some other stuff,

07:48.869 --> 07:50.904
but I wasn't living
a real healthy lifestyle then.

07:50.938 --> 07:52.005
Oh, yeah.

07:52.039 --> 07:53.841
You're a Wade
breakup survivor, too.

07:53.874 --> 07:55.709
You know how he just

07:55.743 --> 07:57.177
gets under your skin?

07:57.210 --> 07:58.679
But look at you.

07:58.712 --> 07:59.713
You're not sad.

07:59.747 --> 08:00.981
How can I be like that?

08:01.014 --> 08:02.082
I will do anything.

08:02.115 --> 08:03.551
Well, it just takes time.

08:03.584 --> 08:06.687
No, no. I mean now.

08:06.720 --> 08:08.722
*

08:08.756 --> 08:10.658
(grunts)

08:10.691 --> 08:12.726
Welcome to the official
Wade-free zone.

08:12.760 --> 08:15.262
But "modernation"
is the key.

08:15.295 --> 08:18.866
Modulation...
modernization.

08:18.899 --> 08:20.033
I agree.

08:20.067 --> 08:22.536
You know, this is great.

08:22.570 --> 08:23.671
(sighs)

08:23.704 --> 08:25.606
But honestly,
I still feel terrible.

08:25.639 --> 08:28.141
That's 'cause you haven't
killed enough brain cells yet.

08:28.175 --> 08:29.710
I'm a doctor.

08:29.743 --> 08:31.745
I should know that.

08:31.779 --> 08:35.015
To the death of
brain cells.

08:35.048 --> 08:37.017
Especially the ones
that remind us of...

08:37.049 --> 08:38.719
* Gotta run from Wade

08:40.621 --> 08:42.756
* Hide out in the shade

08:42.789 --> 08:45.959
* From all the messes
that he made *

08:45.993 --> 08:49.162
* And all the games
that he played *

08:49.196 --> 08:52.299
* Run from Wade...

08:52.332 --> 08:55.135
How many dead brain cells
until I didn't see that?

08:55.168 --> 08:56.770
* And the bills he left

08:56.804 --> 08:58.305
* Unpaid

08:58.338 --> 09:00.674
* The love that he betrayed

09:00.708 --> 09:02.776
* Run from Wade

09:02.810 --> 09:03.977
(laughter)

09:04.011 --> 09:06.046
So, she's already moved
Grandma Vera's rug

09:06.079 --> 09:07.815
and she put up
fuchsia drapes

09:07.848 --> 09:08.949
in the guest room.

09:08.982 --> 09:10.751
Classic.
(chuckles)

09:10.784 --> 09:12.319
I'm sorry, what is fuchsia?

09:12.352 --> 09:13.320
Jonah, point is,

09:13.353 --> 09:16.289
once Daddy experiences
the full Shelby disaster

09:16.323 --> 09:19.226
in full bloom, then she'll be
out of our home for good.

09:20.694 --> 09:21.829
Hmm.

09:21.862 --> 09:23.797
What?

09:23.831 --> 09:24.865
Hmm?

09:25.833 --> 09:27.334
Listen,

09:27.367 --> 09:29.336
remember the time
when we were kids

09:29.369 --> 09:31.204
and I made you eat the carpet

09:31.238 --> 09:32.940
in the upstairs hallway?
Mm-hmm.

09:32.973 --> 09:34.074
That will seem
like an appetizer

09:34.107 --> 09:35.208
if you don't tell me
what you know.

09:35.242 --> 09:37.110
(sighs)

09:37.144 --> 09:39.880
Your dad's asking Shelby
to move in.

09:39.913 --> 09:41.715
What?

09:41.749 --> 09:42.983
Well, I won't allow it.

09:43.016 --> 09:44.618
Well, he's not gonna ask
for your permission.

09:44.652 --> 09:46.754
My father would
never, ever, ever

09:46.787 --> 09:48.288
let a woman move into our house

09:48.321 --> 09:49.289
without his
daughter's permission.

09:49.322 --> 09:51.091
Well, he figures he only
needs to get one of you,

09:51.124 --> 09:52.159
and then the other
will follow suit.

09:52.192 --> 09:53.627
You're not the
only Breeland

09:53.661 --> 09:54.762
who knows how
to exploit the weak.

09:54.795 --> 09:55.763
(gasps)

09:55.796 --> 09:57.030
Oh, no.

10:03.036 --> 10:04.872
I just can't believe him.

10:04.905 --> 10:06.707
Of course he cheated on you.

10:06.740 --> 10:08.842
He's Wade Kinsella,
selfish to the bone.

10:08.876 --> 10:10.377
He never even had
clean sheets.

10:10.410 --> 10:11.779
Oh, my God, what about him

10:11.812 --> 10:13.146
clipping his toenails
on my couch?

10:13.180 --> 10:15.048
What is up with that?
Yeah, and those

10:15.082 --> 10:17.317
puppy dog eyes every time
he forgets your birthday,

10:17.350 --> 10:19.386
or leaves his wet
towel on the bed,

10:19.419 --> 10:21.154
or runs over your pet gerbil.

10:23.757 --> 10:25.726
I got to go finish up my set.

10:25.759 --> 10:26.994
Stay strong, girl.

10:27.027 --> 10:29.029
(cheering)

10:29.062 --> 10:31.031
I take it back.

10:31.064 --> 10:32.399
I feel much better.

10:32.432 --> 10:34.201
Lily Anne is great.

10:34.234 --> 10:37.404
* Got to run from Wade,
hide in the shade *

10:37.437 --> 10:39.406
* Run from Wade,
run from Wade... *
Zoe?

10:39.439 --> 10:41.141
What?
Stop.

10:41.174 --> 10:43.076
Why? It's helping.
LILY ANNE: Hey, y'all.
This song goes out

10:43.110 --> 10:46.046
to my fellow sister
in pain, Miss Zoe Hart.

10:46.079 --> 10:47.280
(whooping, cheering)
Yeah!

10:47.314 --> 10:48.415
(applause, cheering
and whistling)

10:48.448 --> 10:51.685
* Why don't he ever
wear a shirt? *

10:51.719 --> 10:54.154
Yeah, why doesn't he ever
wear a shirt?

10:54.187 --> 10:56.790
* Would a little bit
of modesty hurt? *

10:59.059 --> 11:03.764
Zoe, letting hate into your
heart is not the answer.

11:03.797 --> 11:06.333
But hating just looks so easy.

11:06.366 --> 11:08.268
* Chasing anything
that wears a skirt... *

11:08.301 --> 11:09.436
Look at Lily Anne.

11:09.469 --> 11:12.439
* Why don't he ever
wear a shirt? *

11:12.472 --> 11:14.908
She's been singing the
same songs for four years,

11:14.942 --> 11:17.878
and she is just as angry as
the day she and Wade broke up.

11:17.911 --> 11:19.112
It's your choice.

11:19.146 --> 11:21.715
Be Lily Anne and angry
the rest of your life,

11:21.749 --> 11:26.119
or do like me and let yourself
grieve, really grieve,

11:26.153 --> 11:29.456
and end up happy with a
guy like George Tucker.

11:29.489 --> 11:31.925
And I mean like George Tucker,

11:31.959 --> 11:33.761
not George Tucker himself.

11:33.794 --> 11:35.763
You're right.

11:35.796 --> 11:38.832
I'm not gonna let hate
into my heart.

11:38.866 --> 11:42.002
* Why don't he ever
wear a shirt? *

11:42.035 --> 11:44.905
(applause and cheering)

11:47.307 --> 11:49.376
(seagulls calling)

11:49.409 --> 11:51.711
(birds singing)

11:57.517 --> 11:59.719
(sighs)

12:01.521 --> 12:02.923
(foot thuds, gasps)

12:02.956 --> 12:06.426
(whimpers, groans)

12:06.459 --> 12:08.461
Stupid Wade!

12:09.529 --> 12:12.099
(sighs)

12:12.132 --> 12:15.803
I will not let hate
into my heart.

12:15.836 --> 12:17.838
I'm sorry, boot.

12:19.006 --> 12:21.809
ROSE:
 I'm sorry, Zoe.

12:21.842 --> 12:23.010
So, how are you feeling?

12:23.043 --> 12:25.245
You know how you always think
that pie can make you happy?

12:25.278 --> 12:27.247
Not true.

12:27.280 --> 12:28.849
Don't worry.

12:28.882 --> 12:30.383
I already checked,
and Wade is not gonna be

12:30.417 --> 12:31.451
on shift till tonight.

12:31.484 --> 12:33.553
Thanks. And thanks
for meeting me for breakfast.

12:33.586 --> 12:36.123
Distraction is exactly
what I need.

12:36.156 --> 12:38.558
So, just talk to me about you
and just keep talking.

12:38.591 --> 12:40.994
Well, uh, Max and I
have made it official.

12:41.028 --> 12:43.263
He put that he's
in a relationship

12:43.296 --> 12:44.497
on his Facebook page.

12:44.531 --> 12:46.299
Ooh! Are you guys
meeting, like,

12:46.333 --> 12:48.035
every day after school
to do homework together?

12:48.068 --> 12:50.003
Totally. Except lately,
he's had to cancel

12:50.037 --> 12:52.139
because he's doing
a study on pond frogs

12:52.172 --> 12:53.807
for his science fair project.

12:53.841 --> 12:56.043
It's not super great for my ego

12:56.076 --> 12:58.411
that I'm losing out
to fly-eating amphibians,

12:58.445 --> 12:59.880
but it's temporary.

12:59.913 --> 13:01.281
Rose, I am so happy for you.

13:01.314 --> 13:02.983
Take this.

13:04.551 --> 13:05.986
Trust me.

13:06.019 --> 13:07.120
It'll help.

13:07.154 --> 13:09.556
SHULA:
And I have connections,

13:09.589 --> 13:12.225
if you want
to make Wade disappear.

13:13.360 --> 13:15.328
That's all I can say.

13:15.362 --> 13:17.931
In fact, I have said too much.

13:22.369 --> 13:23.503
(grunts)

13:26.940 --> 13:28.308
MAGNOLIA:
 What's the emergency?

13:28.341 --> 13:29.910
Okay, you know
that big dinner

13:29.943 --> 13:31.344
Daddy just
texted us about?
Mm-hmm.

13:31.378 --> 13:33.380
He's going to tell us
that Shelby is moving in.

13:33.413 --> 13:34.414
(gasps)

13:34.447 --> 13:36.917
Lemon, get your head
in the game.

13:36.950 --> 13:38.151
Your evil skills are slipping.

13:38.185 --> 13:39.386
Not anymore.
I have always believed

13:39.419 --> 13:40.620
that Shelby
has an ulterior motive

13:40.653 --> 13:42.890
for dating Daddy,
and I am going to prove it

13:42.923 --> 13:44.591
and get rid of her
once and for all.

13:44.624 --> 13:46.026
Yay, you're back!

13:46.059 --> 13:47.995
Meanwhile,
you have to stay strong.

13:48.028 --> 13:48.996
Because I believe

13:49.029 --> 13:51.198
that Shelby and Daddy
are going to target you

13:51.231 --> 13:52.499
and try and buy your approval.

13:52.532 --> 13:54.001
Buy? What, with gifts?

13:54.034 --> 13:55.602
Forget it. (scoffs)

13:55.635 --> 13:58.138
Why? What's their budget?
Magnolia!

13:58.171 --> 14:01.341
Now is not the time to cave in
to your God-given materialism.

14:01.374 --> 14:02.910
Do you want Shelby
as your stepmom?

14:02.943 --> 14:04.044
No, I'd rather die.

14:04.077 --> 14:05.946
Just say no.
No, no, no, no, no.

14:05.979 --> 14:08.949
Okay, I get it.
God, it's like health class.

14:08.982 --> 14:10.951
ZOE:
 Yep, it's strep throat.

14:10.984 --> 14:12.886
I'm going to give you a shot
of antibiotics to help,

14:12.920 --> 14:13.954
but it's very contagious,

14:13.987 --> 14:15.889
so avoid close contact
with others.

14:15.923 --> 14:18.058
Yeah. So not gonna happen.

14:18.091 --> 14:19.059
Excuse me?

14:19.092 --> 14:20.060
Every day after school,

14:20.093 --> 14:21.962
I meet my boyfriend
at the pond.

14:21.995 --> 14:23.563
Well, the guy who
will be my boyfriend

14:23.596 --> 14:25.265
once he dumps the
girl he's dating now,

14:25.298 --> 14:26.967
who is so not as hot as me.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.302
Oh. Small prick.

14:29.336 --> 14:30.337
Ow!

14:31.604 --> 14:34.942
I'm sorry if I seemed angry,
but I'm not.

14:34.975 --> 14:37.377
It's just that people get hurt
when others cheat.

14:37.410 --> 14:40.113
Don't take it out on me that
Wade Kinsella cheated on you.

14:40.147 --> 14:41.514
Seriously? That's how
you're going to talk

14:41.548 --> 14:42.983
to the woman with the needle?

14:43.016 --> 14:44.651
It's your job
to give me medical advice,

14:44.684 --> 14:46.920
not judge me just because
guys find me irresistible.

14:46.954 --> 14:48.655
You know what? You're so right.

14:48.688 --> 14:51.324
You should send your boyfriend
in for treatment

14:51.358 --> 14:54.261
since he's been exposed
to your irresistible strep.

14:54.294 --> 14:55.128
(scoffs)

14:55.162 --> 14:56.529
LAVON:
 Look, I know

14:56.563 --> 14:59.199
I promised I'd help with
the casino fund-raiser,

14:59.232 --> 15:01.701
but I got important
mayoral duties.

15:01.734 --> 15:03.636
Yeah, I've been picking up
some extra shifts

15:03.670 --> 15:05.305
to try and save money for, uh...

15:05.338 --> 15:07.274
(clears throat)
...my Aunt Polly.

15:07.307 --> 15:08.308
Got to balance the budget.

15:08.341 --> 15:09.943
She's very sick.

15:09.977 --> 15:11.211
Got a deficit.

15:11.244 --> 15:12.545
A real huge one.

15:12.579 --> 15:14.547
Chicken pox. Bad ones.

15:14.581 --> 15:16.283
Yeah, I told her,

15:16.316 --> 15:18.285
"Don't be handling
those chickens."

15:18.318 --> 15:20.020
Polly.

15:20.053 --> 15:23.056
I've heard better excuses
from eight-year-olds.

15:23.090 --> 15:25.292
Now, what is going on

15:25.325 --> 15:27.060
with you and Lavon?

15:27.094 --> 15:27.727
Wade screwed up.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.296
I screwed up.

15:29.329 --> 15:31.164
And I can't be around Wade
right now.

15:31.198 --> 15:32.332
Well, I'm sorry to hear

15:32.365 --> 15:34.101
that you two are having
such troubles,

15:34.134 --> 15:37.204
but this is the church's
biggest fund-raiser

15:37.237 --> 15:39.039
of the year.

15:39.072 --> 15:42.109
And do we really want
to disappoint the big guy?

15:43.476 --> 15:46.379
Wow. You really do
play that card a lot.

15:47.514 --> 15:49.382
Hi!

15:49.416 --> 15:51.118
I baked you

15:51.151 --> 15:52.352
your favorite apple crisp.

15:52.385 --> 15:54.587
I was going to bake
you your favorite pie,

15:54.621 --> 15:57.490
but for some reason, all the pie
tins in this town are sold out.

15:57.524 --> 16:00.727
Okay. All right,
what do you want?

16:00.760 --> 16:02.462
George Tucker,
you know, it really saddens me

16:02.495 --> 16:03.463
that you wouldn't think

16:03.496 --> 16:06.099
I would bake you an apple crisp
just to be nice.

16:06.133 --> 16:07.367
But since you happen

16:07.400 --> 16:09.036
to be right,
let's get down to it.

16:09.069 --> 16:11.771
I need you to help me
dig up dirt on Shelby

16:11.804 --> 16:14.541
so I can make Daddy
break up with her.
Uh, no.

16:14.574 --> 16:15.642
No, no, no, no, no.

16:15.675 --> 16:19.046
No, I have no desire
to get involved in the love life

16:19.079 --> 16:21.148
of my ex-girlfriend
with my ex-fiancÃ©e.

16:21.181 --> 16:23.616
But Daddy's about to let Shelby
move in, and for all we know,

16:23.650 --> 16:25.618
she could be a black widow
or a Russian spy.

16:25.652 --> 16:27.120
We need to protect him.

16:27.154 --> 16:29.489
Okay, first off,
not a murderer or a spy.

16:29.522 --> 16:32.259
Secondly, if you want Brick
to break up with Shelby,

16:32.292 --> 16:34.027
well, good luck to you,

16:34.061 --> 16:36.429
because that girl
is an anti-breakup ninja.

16:36.463 --> 16:38.365
George Tucker,
you left me at the altar.

16:38.398 --> 16:39.332
You owe me.

16:39.366 --> 16:40.700
What is the statute
of limitations on that?

16:40.733 --> 16:43.070
Eternity!

16:44.104 --> 16:46.239
Fine. Fine, fine.

16:46.273 --> 16:48.275
What do you...
what do you need me to do?

16:48.308 --> 16:50.043
I need you to be my decoy.

16:50.077 --> 16:52.212
I did a little
online stalking,

16:52.245 --> 16:54.747
and I discovered that Shelby
has put her condo up for sale

16:54.781 --> 16:56.116
in Pensacola.

16:56.149 --> 16:57.250
Tomorrow, there's an open house,

16:57.284 --> 16:58.651
which gives me
the perfect opportunity

16:58.685 --> 16:59.752
to snoop through her things

16:59.786 --> 17:02.155
and find out what skeletons
she has in her closet.

17:02.189 --> 17:04.191
And here's where I think
I should tell you

17:04.223 --> 17:06.226
that an open house
is not carte blanche to...

17:06.259 --> 17:07.294
Eternity, George!

17:08.694 --> 17:11.364
Why don't you just consider it
the house-hunting

17:11.397 --> 17:14.233
that you deprived me of
when you left me at the altar?

17:14.267 --> 17:15.435
Okay?

17:15.468 --> 17:18.271
(chuckles softly)

17:19.672 --> 17:21.641
Wow. That was good.

17:25.444 --> 17:27.280
Hey, Max,
I didn't know you were here.

17:27.314 --> 17:28.515
Uh, hey, Dr. Hart.

17:28.548 --> 17:30.850
I hope you're not mad,
but I saw Dr. Breeland.

17:30.883 --> 17:34.154
I just thought it'd be weird
if I was your patient, you know,

17:34.187 --> 17:36.656
given our romantic history
and all.

17:36.689 --> 17:39.459
No problem.
All right, well, see you.

17:39.492 --> 17:40.727
Okay.

17:40.760 --> 17:42.195
Is Max okay?
Yeah.

17:42.229 --> 17:43.430
Just came in for
a penicillin shot.

17:43.463 --> 17:44.564
Case of strep throat.

17:44.597 --> 17:46.599
Strep?
Mm-hmm.

17:46.633 --> 17:48.868
I had a patient earlier today
who came in for strep,

17:48.901 --> 17:51.438
and I told her to send her
boyfriend in for a check-up.

17:51.471 --> 17:53.473
So Max must be her boyfriend.

17:53.506 --> 17:55.675
You're like a master detective.

17:55.708 --> 17:57.310
No. Max is Rose's boyfriend.

17:57.344 --> 18:00.280
And he told her that he's been
studying frogs at the pond

18:00.313 --> 18:01.414
for his science project,

18:01.448 --> 18:02.815
but instead,
he's been studying Tonya!

18:02.849 --> 18:04.551
Well, this makes me mad.

18:06.586 --> 18:08.221
For Rose. Not for me.

18:08.255 --> 18:09.789
I am not mad.

18:09.822 --> 18:12.125
Excuse me!

18:14.861 --> 18:17.597
What you did

18:17.630 --> 18:19.332
is the worst thing
anyone ever did to me.

18:19.366 --> 18:21.401
And I don't want
to be a big person about it

18:21.434 --> 18:22.602
and just let my anger go.

18:22.635 --> 18:24.237
Because it is official!

18:24.271 --> 18:25.638
I hate you.

18:25.672 --> 18:28.875
I will always hate you,
and I will enjoy hating you!

18:28.908 --> 18:31.344
Feel better?

18:31.378 --> 18:32.645
Yes!

18:32.679 --> 18:34.681
Thank you.

18:41.688 --> 18:44.391
(sighs)

18:44.424 --> 18:46.926
(instrumental intro
to "Run from Wade" plays)

18:46.959 --> 18:50.430
* Gotta run from Wade

18:50.463 --> 18:53.400
* Hide out in the shade

18:53.433 --> 18:55.535
* From all the messes
that he made *

18:55.568 --> 18:59.472
* And all the games
that he played *

18:59.506 --> 19:02.775
* Run from Wade

19:02.809 --> 19:04.611
* Run from Wade

19:06.513 --> 19:09.949
* And the bills
he left unpaid *

19:09.982 --> 19:12.919
* The love that he betrayed

19:12.952 --> 19:15.488
* Run from Wade.

19:18.291 --> 19:19.426
(laughs)

19:19.459 --> 19:20.660
Chin up, Dr. Hart.

19:20.693 --> 19:22.262
You deserve
better than Wade.

19:22.295 --> 19:23.530
You're right, Frank.

19:23.563 --> 19:24.631
Screw Wade!

19:24.664 --> 19:26.933
Don't know that we need
the language, uh...
Oh.

19:26.966 --> 19:28.335
Dr. Hart?

19:28.368 --> 19:29.569
(clears throat)

19:29.602 --> 19:31.571
Wow. You look chipper.

19:31.604 --> 19:33.473
Mmm, I had a catharsis
last night.

19:33.506 --> 19:35.775
Did it involve a bonfire?
'Cause you smell like soot.

19:35.808 --> 19:38.278
I may have burned a few things
in my chipperness.

19:38.311 --> 19:40.780
Oh. Burning Wade's stuff to
get over those breakup blues.

19:40.813 --> 19:42.949
Nice. You want to know
what works even better?

19:42.982 --> 19:45.385
Sex. I'm way ahead of you.
What do you want?

19:45.418 --> 19:48.288
Well, I know you think that kid
Max is cheating on your friend,

19:48.321 --> 19:49.689
but you're gonna
let that go, right?

19:49.722 --> 19:51.824
Let it go? You know,
there's a little thing

19:51.858 --> 19:52.959
in relationships called
being faithful.

19:52.992 --> 19:54.327
It may be too nuanced

19:54.361 --> 19:55.962
for your smooth little brain
to comprehend,

19:55.995 --> 19:57.664
but if you knew Rose...

19:57.697 --> 19:58.865
Yeah, yeah, I get it.

19:58.898 --> 20:00.500
She's a sweet, sweet girl,
blah-blah-blah,

20:00.533 --> 20:02.302
but in medicine,
there is this thing

20:02.335 --> 20:04.471
called doctor-patient
confidentiality.

20:04.504 --> 20:06.706
And since, technically,
I'm Max's doctor,

20:06.739 --> 20:08.808
if you tell Rose,
I could be liable.

20:08.841 --> 20:10.843
Hmm.
I just want
to make sure

20:10.877 --> 20:12.879
that your anger towards men
doesn't cause you

20:12.912 --> 20:14.747
to tell people things
that you shouldn't.

20:14.781 --> 20:16.549
Well, thank you
for that lecture.

20:16.583 --> 20:17.650
And just so you know,

20:17.684 --> 20:19.719
I would never break
doctor-patient confidentiality.

20:19.752 --> 20:21.421
However,

20:21.454 --> 20:22.455
I can't help it

20:22.489 --> 20:23.590
if I run into Rose

20:23.623 --> 20:24.857
and the truth just comes out.

20:24.891 --> 20:27.494
* Come and join the parade

20:27.527 --> 20:30.229
* Run from Wade.

20:40.607 --> 20:43.576
No, how about you run the
donation table and serve

20:43.610 --> 20:45.812
the God-approved
nonalcoholic beverages,

20:45.845 --> 20:47.980
and I'll oversee the craps?

20:48.014 --> 20:49.749
Babs Foster already
got dibs on craps.

20:49.782 --> 20:51.551
She got herself
a new craps stick.

20:51.584 --> 20:53.620
Then I'll work the
blackjack table.

20:53.653 --> 20:55.455
Already said I'm
working the blackjack table.

20:55.488 --> 20:57.457
And I'm the mayor.
I get to say.

20:57.490 --> 20:58.825
Fine.

21:01.093 --> 21:02.662
Donations go in the box.

21:02.695 --> 21:04.364
And if Old Man Henderson
wants in,

21:04.397 --> 21:05.798
pat him down for loaded dice.

21:07.800 --> 21:09.402
Thank you.

21:09.436 --> 21:11.704
See, the problem
with living on a boat

21:11.738 --> 21:13.373
is that you can't
pretend you're not home

21:13.406 --> 21:15.475
when people come by
and ask you to snoop

21:15.508 --> 21:17.844
in your ex-girlfriend's house.

21:17.877 --> 21:18.845
Yeah.

21:18.878 --> 21:20.046
That's one of them.

21:20.079 --> 21:21.514
Mildew's another...

21:21.548 --> 21:23.015
thing.
Welcome.

21:23.049 --> 21:24.517
My name's Brayden.

21:24.551 --> 21:26.786
Let me know if I can
answer any questions.

21:26.819 --> 21:28.955
The unit has southern exposures,
central air,

21:28.988 --> 21:32.692
and the building skews
toward young couples.

21:32.725 --> 21:33.660
Are you two married?

21:33.693 --> 21:35.061
Uh, no.
Almost.

21:35.094 --> 21:36.062
(laughs)

21:36.095 --> 21:38.631
This one is just so hard
to get down the aisle.

21:38.665 --> 21:39.932
(both laugh)

21:39.966 --> 21:41.734
Oh, honey, this room
is so perfect

21:41.768 --> 21:43.336
for that dinette
set you always

21:43.370 --> 21:44.671
promised you'd
get me but didn't.

21:44.704 --> 21:45.672
Hmm.

21:45.705 --> 21:46.673
Really? The dinette set?

21:46.706 --> 21:48.775
You're gonna hold that
over my head, too?
Yep.

21:48.808 --> 21:49.942
Okay.
Oh, I just

21:49.976 --> 21:51.811
love this hutch.

21:54.981 --> 21:57.049
George...

21:57.083 --> 21:58.718
she has a secret child.

21:58.751 --> 22:00.319
(quietly):
Let me see.

22:02.655 --> 22:04.957
"To the best aunt ever."

22:04.991 --> 22:06.125
Lemon.

22:06.158 --> 22:07.994
This is insane.

22:08.027 --> 22:09.696
It's also borderline
trespassing.

22:09.729 --> 22:12.365
No, it's not.

22:12.399 --> 22:14.567
If there's a sign out front
and an open door,

22:14.601 --> 22:15.968
they waive all their rights.

22:16.002 --> 22:18.538
You are a lawyer. I can't
believe you don't know that.

22:18.571 --> 22:20.373
So...

22:20.407 --> 22:22.108
is there anything I can
tell you about the place?

22:22.141 --> 22:23.643
No, we're good.
Uh, storage.

22:23.676 --> 22:24.677
Storage.

22:24.711 --> 22:25.678
Where can I store things?

22:25.712 --> 22:26.946
All kinds of things.

22:26.979 --> 22:28.147
Like, important
documents,

22:28.180 --> 22:29.281
my diary, that
sort of thing.

22:29.315 --> 22:32.619
If you're looking for storage,
this is your dream place.

22:32.652 --> 22:34.521
There's an incredible
walk-in closet

22:34.554 --> 22:37.424
in the hallway
outside the master bedroom.

22:37.457 --> 22:38.591
(gasps)
Wonderful.

22:38.625 --> 22:39.892
George,

22:39.926 --> 22:42.094
why don't you ask Brayden
that long list

22:42.128 --> 22:43.396
of questions that you have

22:43.430 --> 22:45.732
while I go take
a quick peek?

22:45.765 --> 22:47.600
Yeah, but, honey, I don't...

22:47.634 --> 22:48.668
I didn't...

22:51.037 --> 22:54.507
So, um, wh-what's...

22:54.541 --> 22:56.909
what's the bird situation?

23:00.046 --> 23:01.614
Hi, Magnolia.

23:01.648 --> 23:02.615
I'm going

23:02.649 --> 23:03.650
shoe shopping.

23:03.683 --> 23:04.651
Want to come?

23:04.684 --> 23:06.786
No, thanks.

23:09.188 --> 23:11.758
Hey, I feel bad,
but your dad gave me

23:11.791 --> 23:13.493
this Tory Burch purse

23:13.526 --> 23:15.495
on vacation.

23:15.528 --> 23:17.464
It is more your style.

23:17.497 --> 23:18.931
You want it?

23:20.467 --> 23:22.635
Nope. I definitely do not.

23:25.104 --> 23:26.739
Hey, girl.

23:26.773 --> 23:28.074
My friend

23:28.107 --> 23:29.742
gave me two tickets to see

23:29.776 --> 23:31.043
Carrie Underwood in Jackson.

23:31.077 --> 23:32.078
Want to go?

23:32.111 --> 23:33.746
Take a friend?

23:33.780 --> 23:35.515
Go backstage, meet her...

23:36.916 --> 23:38.184
Maybe sing a little something?

23:43.089 --> 23:44.691
No, thanks.

23:53.833 --> 23:55.768
This should be
right in my wheelhouse.

23:55.802 --> 23:57.036
I thought you said Magnolia

23:57.069 --> 23:58.871
was materialistic
and shallow.

23:58.905 --> 24:00.940
Well, I love her, and
she has many gifts,

24:00.973 --> 24:02.575
but she is.

24:02.609 --> 24:03.910
There is no
way she had

24:03.943 --> 24:06.145
that much willpower
on her own.

24:06.178 --> 24:07.213
Lemon.

24:07.246 --> 24:09.749
Lemon must have
gotten to her.

24:09.782 --> 24:11.217
So, now what?

24:13.252 --> 24:16.889
Well, we just have
to out-Lemon Lemon.

24:16.923 --> 24:19.726
(chuckles)

24:21.160 --> 24:22.895
(whooping, laughter)

24:22.929 --> 24:25.197
Don't give me that boyish look.

24:25.231 --> 24:26.666
Lucky streak, my heinie.

24:26.699 --> 24:27.834
You counting cards.

24:27.867 --> 24:29.035
I-I swear I'm not.

24:29.068 --> 24:30.202
I suck at cards,

24:30.236 --> 24:31.771
and I can't count
worth a hoot.

24:31.804 --> 24:32.972
It's true.

24:33.005 --> 24:35.074
And P.S., that boyish look

24:35.107 --> 24:37.977
is the only look
my new husband has,

24:38.010 --> 24:39.011
so back off.

24:39.045 --> 24:40.713
Okay, everybody
calm down, now.

24:40.747 --> 24:42.214
I'll have to call the pit boss.

24:42.248 --> 24:43.983
Ain't no pit boss.

24:44.016 --> 24:46.753
He'll just take you out back
and break your legs.

24:50.289 --> 24:51.691
That'll be ten
dollars, Frank.

24:51.724 --> 24:53.092
Sucking up to God

24:53.125 --> 24:54.894
ain't gonna make up
for what you did

24:54.927 --> 24:55.928
to Zoe.

24:55.962 --> 24:57.063
God hates you.

24:57.096 --> 24:57.864
No, no.

24:57.897 --> 24:59.999
Not true. Now,
God doesn't hate Wade.

25:00.032 --> 25:01.601
God loves everyone.

25:01.634 --> 25:03.570
Maybe officially,
but you just know

25:03.603 --> 25:05.004
he's got a list.

25:06.038 --> 25:07.273
(sighs)

25:07.306 --> 25:09.776
I need to take a break.

25:17.283 --> 25:18.618
ROSE:
Zoe?

25:18.651 --> 25:20.019
What are you doing here?

25:20.052 --> 25:22.622
Hey, is this
your school?

25:22.655 --> 25:23.623
Who knew?

25:23.656 --> 25:25.291
Anyhoo, just so
glad we happened

25:25.324 --> 25:26.893
to run into each other.

25:26.926 --> 25:28.294
Wow, you seem so happy.

25:28.327 --> 25:30.029
Not letting hate
into your heart

25:30.062 --> 25:31.163
is really working for you.

25:31.197 --> 25:32.899
Oh, no. I tried
not to let hate in,

25:32.932 --> 25:34.634
but you know what?
Hate is a real charmer.

25:34.667 --> 25:36.302
So I said, "What the
heck, come on in."

25:36.335 --> 25:37.236
Brought two of
his friends,

25:37.269 --> 25:39.105
petty and vindictive,
and you know what?

25:39.138 --> 25:40.272
We have been
partying it up.

25:40.306 --> 25:41.273
It's awesome.

25:41.307 --> 25:42.875
Enough about me.
How's Max?

25:42.909 --> 25:44.644
Uh, good.
He had a sore throat,

25:44.677 --> 25:45.945
but he seemed
to be better today.

25:45.978 --> 25:47.179
How is his project going?

25:47.213 --> 25:48.314
Oh, I don't really know.

25:48.347 --> 25:49.982
It's about frogs,
so I don't really ask.

25:50.016 --> 25:51.183
To be honest,
I can't wait

25:51.217 --> 25:52.719
until this science fair
project is over,

25:52.752 --> 25:54.053
because the next day
is Max's birthday,

25:54.086 --> 25:56.122
and I've been saving up
to get him a guitar.

25:56.155 --> 25:57.957
Don't!
What?

25:58.991 --> 26:00.059
I mean...

26:00.092 --> 26:01.961
don't you want to know

26:01.994 --> 26:03.996
more about Max's
science project?

26:04.030 --> 26:05.798
No, not really.
Great.

26:05.832 --> 26:08.200
Let's drop in on Max
and check out those frogs.
Okay.

26:12.038 --> 26:14.874
I don't get it. Why the
sudden interest in frogs?

26:14.907 --> 26:17.810
Because someone told me
that it is frog mating season,

26:17.844 --> 26:20.012
and this is where they come
to do their froggy business.

26:20.046 --> 26:21.748
And, if we're quiet,
we can catch--

26:21.781 --> 26:22.749
uh, see them.

26:22.782 --> 26:24.917
I don't want
to see frogs doing it.

26:24.951 --> 26:25.918
Sounds gross.

26:25.952 --> 26:26.953
So gross.

26:26.986 --> 26:27.820
But you know what?

26:27.854 --> 26:29.922
Sometimes you have
to confront reality.

26:29.956 --> 26:33.192
And reality has taught me
that frogs, like men,

26:33.225 --> 26:34.727
have trouble sticking
to one mate.

26:34.761 --> 26:36.095
And I feel bad
for the frogs.

26:36.128 --> 26:37.897
Just like I would
feel bad for you

26:37.930 --> 26:39.932
if Max turned out
to be a frog.

26:39.966 --> 26:42.101
Whoa, I'm confused.

26:42.134 --> 26:44.370
Are you saying
you think Max is a frog?

26:44.403 --> 26:46.105
No.

26:46.138 --> 26:49.041
Well, you know, maybe.
I hadn't thought about it.

26:49.075 --> 26:51.277
I just think it seems a
little odd that he picked

26:51.310 --> 26:53.079
this pond to do his
science project,

26:53.112 --> 26:54.714
where all the
kids make out.

26:54.747 --> 26:57.249
No... no, Max
would never cheat on me.

26:57.283 --> 26:58.818
Look, you are just
such a good person,

26:58.851 --> 27:00.419
and I don't want to
see you get hurt.

27:00.452 --> 27:01.721
GIRL:
Hey, it's me.

27:01.754 --> 27:02.822
Shh.

27:02.855 --> 27:04.290
I'm waiting here for you.

27:04.323 --> 27:05.825
What?

27:05.858 --> 27:07.727
Okay, you're on your way?
Sweet.

27:07.760 --> 27:08.961
Wait, you think Max

27:08.995 --> 27:10.663
is cheating on me
with Tonya?

27:10.697 --> 27:11.931
Oh, I don't recall
saying that,

27:11.964 --> 27:13.900
but if that's
what you think...

27:13.933 --> 27:15.301
I think I should know more

27:15.334 --> 27:18.404
about Max's science project.

27:18.437 --> 27:20.740
MAGNOLIA (over phone):
Hey, Lemon, how's it going?

27:20.773 --> 27:21.741
(sighs)

27:21.774 --> 27:23.409
Well, if an addiction
to bedazzling was enough

27:23.442 --> 27:25.878
to get Daddy to break up
with Shelby, we'd be golden.

27:25.912 --> 27:27.413
Okay, how's it going
on your end?

27:27.446 --> 27:32.018
I'm trying, but, well,
a person can only be so strong.

27:32.051 --> 27:33.052
What?

27:33.085 --> 27:34.286
What do you mean?
Ooh, yeah.

27:34.320 --> 27:36.889
Nothing. Just... good luck.

27:36.923 --> 27:37.857
But...

27:37.890 --> 27:38.958
(whispering):
Magnolia!

27:38.991 --> 27:40.092
(beep)

27:40.126 --> 27:41.393
Cool.

27:41.427 --> 27:43.095
Okay, I think we got enough
with the bow on.

27:43.129 --> 27:44.196
You want to take
it for a spin?

27:44.230 --> 27:45.865
(laughs)

27:45.898 --> 27:47.133
Lemon. Hey, hey.

27:47.166 --> 27:48.067
Time's up, okay?

27:48.100 --> 27:50.036
I stalled the chatty Realtor
as long as I...

27:50.069 --> 27:51.303
Are those boas?

27:51.337 --> 27:54.006
Yes, and there's a matching
set of tap shoes in each color.

27:54.040 --> 27:55.141
I don't even
want to know why.

27:55.174 --> 27:56.976
I know why, Lemon.

27:57.009 --> 27:59.445
Shelby's not a woman.
She's a drag queen.

27:59.478 --> 28:01.781
Quick. We got to go
tell Brick right away.

28:01.814 --> 28:03.783
George Tucker, do not mock me.

28:03.816 --> 28:05.785
(clears throat)
Magnolia's clearly folding

28:05.818 --> 28:08.187
like a house of cards, and we
are the last bastion of hope

28:08.220 --> 28:10.322
to keep Daddy from making the
biggest mistake of his life!

28:10.356 --> 28:12.024
No, I'm out.
 My daddy!

28:12.058 --> 28:14.126
Who lost thousands of
dollars on a wedding

28:14.160 --> 28:15.361
that never happened.

28:15.394 --> 28:17.329
All right, okay, all right.

28:17.363 --> 28:20.432
What? What do...
what do you want me to do?

28:20.466 --> 28:22.835
Go through these
bank records.

28:22.869 --> 28:24.771
(both sigh)

28:24.804 --> 28:26.338
Okay.

28:27.940 --> 28:29.141
Eugenia, give Cody
back his chips.

28:29.175 --> 28:30.877
He told me
the only thing

28:30.910 --> 28:33.512
that beat my flush
was five of a kind.

28:33.545 --> 28:35.181
It's called a bluff,

28:35.214 --> 28:37.349
and I'm the master of it.

28:37.383 --> 28:39.485
I will hit you with a rock.

28:39.518 --> 28:41.253
Hey, Lavon.

28:41.287 --> 28:43.089
Hate to interrupt
your good time.

28:43.122 --> 28:44.423
What is it, Wade?

28:44.456 --> 28:46.258
Have you seen the, uh, lockbox

28:46.292 --> 28:47.860
that had
all the donations in it?

28:48.861 --> 28:50.763
You're kidding, right?

28:50.797 --> 28:53.432
As much as I could use
a good laugh myself, no.

28:53.465 --> 28:55.434
How did this happen?

28:55.467 --> 28:57.203
I needed a break,
all right, Lavon?

28:57.236 --> 28:59.371
If I had to sit there
and have one more person

28:59.405 --> 29:01.507
wagging their finger at me
about how I mistreated Zoe,

29:01.540 --> 29:02.875
I swear to God,

29:02.909 --> 29:04.110
I was gonna lose my mind.

29:04.143 --> 29:06.512
This is a church fund-raiser.

29:06.545 --> 29:08.314
Those were church funds.

29:08.347 --> 29:11.117
Geez, just take it down
a notch, all right?
No!

29:11.150 --> 29:13.185
And when are you gonna stop
trying to prove

29:13.219 --> 29:15.287
that all you can do
is disappoint people?

29:15.321 --> 29:16.522
We believe you, okay?

29:16.555 --> 29:18.157
You can stop now.

29:18.190 --> 29:20.192
Yeah.

29:20.226 --> 29:22.061
REVEREND MAYFAIR:
Wade?

29:22.094 --> 29:24.130
Mayor Hayes,
everything okay?

29:24.163 --> 29:27.066
Uh, yeah, yeah,
just some unexpected bumps.

29:27.099 --> 29:28.434
(chuckles)
Tell me about it.

29:28.467 --> 29:30.202
I just found
Sergeant Jefferies

29:30.236 --> 29:32.171
with this.

29:32.204 --> 29:34.140
Apparently, he thought
it was his lunch box.

29:34.173 --> 29:37.343
I don't think
that it, uh,

29:37.376 --> 29:39.345
takes anything away
from the miracle

29:39.378 --> 29:42.281
of God's creatures
to say that some of them

29:42.314 --> 29:44.951
are just plain nuts.

29:44.984 --> 29:46.986
(chuckles)

29:52.258 --> 29:54.326
(groans)
Good Lord!

29:54.360 --> 29:55.561
What self-respecting woman

29:55.594 --> 29:57.830
in the 21st century
wears scrunchies?

29:57.864 --> 30:00.199
Maybe you're right.

30:00.232 --> 30:02.101
Maybe Shelby doesn't
have any dark secrets

30:02.134 --> 30:04.303
other than a severe
lack of good taste.

30:04.336 --> 30:05.905
No, no, hang on.

30:05.938 --> 30:07.573
Maybe you're right.

30:07.606 --> 30:10.209
Look, these-these...
these bank statements

30:10.242 --> 30:12.444
show that Shelby's behind
on her mortgage.

30:12.478 --> 30:14.046
Wait, what?

30:14.080 --> 30:16.415
Yeah, not just by
a little bit, either.

30:16.448 --> 30:19.618
She has a massive amount
of debt here.

30:19.651 --> 30:20.953
Yay!

30:20.987 --> 30:22.354
Shelby is

30:22.388 --> 30:24.123
a gold digger.
I told you so.

30:24.156 --> 30:25.324
Do not try and hide something

30:25.357 --> 30:26.959
from Lemon Breeland
'cause I will find it.

30:26.993 --> 30:28.127
I will find it.

30:28.160 --> 30:29.528
You found it, but still.

30:29.561 --> 30:30.762
BRAYDEN:
Since you asked
about storage space...

30:30.796 --> 30:33.465
Oh, my Lord, how are we gonna
explain that we're in here?

30:33.499 --> 30:36.335
(gasps)

30:36.368 --> 30:37.970
Oh, my.

30:38.004 --> 30:39.305
Oh, hey, hey.

30:39.338 --> 30:41.440
I'm sorry, we got a
little bit carried away.

30:41.473 --> 30:44.610
You know how it is when
you're almost married.

30:44.643 --> 30:45.878
(chuckles)

30:45.912 --> 30:49.648
By any chance, would you want
to show us the guest bedroom?

30:49.681 --> 30:51.083
Nope.

30:51.117 --> 30:52.218
No, I do not.

30:52.251 --> 30:54.053
Okay.
Okay.

30:54.086 --> 30:56.355
Excuse us. Sorry.

30:59.325 --> 31:00.559
I can't believe Max
would cheat on me.

31:00.592 --> 31:02.962
I thought he was a prince, and
it turns out he's just a frog.

31:02.995 --> 31:04.030
Don't worry, Rose.

31:04.063 --> 31:05.331
We will get
through this together.

31:05.364 --> 31:06.465
I have the perfect song.

31:06.498 --> 31:07.967
"Run from Wade,"

31:08.000 --> 31:09.368
although we could change
the lyrics.

31:09.401 --> 31:10.970
* Max make tracks...

31:11.003 --> 31:12.304
Frog!

31:12.338 --> 31:14.240
Whoa, Rose.

31:14.273 --> 31:15.641
What are you doing here?

31:15.674 --> 31:17.209
Wait, and Dr. Hart.

31:17.243 --> 31:18.644
I can't believe
you're cheating on me.

31:18.677 --> 31:21.213
You liar, two-faced,
frog-faced liar!

31:21.247 --> 31:22.982
Yeah, what she said.

31:23.015 --> 31:23.916
What-what are you talking about?

31:23.950 --> 31:25.484
I'm just here
to do my science project.

31:25.517 --> 31:27.119
(chuckles)
Oh, yeah, right.

31:27.153 --> 31:29.555
Well, if your science project
is to raise Tonya's IQ

31:29.588 --> 31:31.590
above that of a turnip,
you failed.

31:31.623 --> 31:33.125
That's right. Epic fail.

31:33.159 --> 31:34.526
Wait, wait, Tonya?

31:34.560 --> 31:36.128
Oh, you have got
to be kidding me,

31:36.162 --> 31:37.529
because Tonya hates me.

31:37.563 --> 31:39.365
No, seriously.
Watch this.

31:39.398 --> 31:41.500
Hey, Tonya!

31:41.533 --> 31:44.136
Oh, my God.

31:44.170 --> 31:46.138
How many times do I have
to tell you to stop doing

31:46.172 --> 31:48.007
your stupid frog project where
me and my boyfriend make out?

31:48.040 --> 31:49.408
Go get your geek on

31:49.441 --> 31:50.609
somewhere else, pervert.

31:51.543 --> 31:52.979
(sighs)

31:54.446 --> 31:56.282
Yeah, so I don't think
I'm gonna be

31:56.315 --> 31:58.017
hooking up with Tonya
any time soon.

31:58.050 --> 32:01.020
Oh, my God, Max, I am so sorry.

32:01.053 --> 32:02.288
Max, this is all my fault.

32:02.321 --> 32:03.655
I thought, you know,
you had strep,

32:03.689 --> 32:05.157
and Tonya had strep, so I...

32:05.191 --> 32:07.026
Rose, I am so, so sorry.

32:07.059 --> 32:09.028
And I'm so glad
your being mad at Wade

32:09.061 --> 32:10.229
has made you feel better,

32:10.262 --> 32:11.730
but it doesn't mean
everyone's a frog.

32:11.763 --> 32:13.399
Come on, Max.

32:21.173 --> 32:23.009
Lemon, I know you mean well,
but I'm not really sure

32:23.042 --> 32:24.443
you should do this, okay?
Shelby might be

32:24.476 --> 32:26.478
a financial train wreck,
but I know for a fact

32:26.512 --> 32:28.047
that she makes your
dad very happy.

32:28.080 --> 32:30.316
And I know that you mean well,
but I'm not inclined

32:30.349 --> 32:31.517
to take relationship advice
from a man

32:31.550 --> 32:34.453
who just forgot to tell me
that he wasn't in love with me

32:34.486 --> 32:36.388
until our wedding day.
Now, I thank you kindly

32:36.422 --> 32:38.724
for your assistance,
and good night.

32:38.757 --> 32:40.959
(clears throat)

32:43.629 --> 32:45.531
MAGNOLIA:
Lemon, I'm sorry.

32:45.564 --> 32:47.199
They got me a new car.

32:47.233 --> 32:49.601
You can buy movie tickets
from the dashboard.

32:49.635 --> 32:52.104
What?
Shelby's moving in.

32:52.138 --> 32:53.405
Whoa... Magnolia.

32:53.439 --> 32:54.673
You... you ruined

32:54.706 --> 32:55.607
the big surprise.

32:55.641 --> 32:56.408
Sweetheart,
I know

32:56.442 --> 32:59.178
how protective
you can be, so I hope

32:59.211 --> 33:00.612
you can get on board

33:00.646 --> 33:02.214
without needing
a whole new set of wheels.

33:02.248 --> 33:03.549
Lemon, I'm so glad
you could make it.

33:03.582 --> 33:04.616
Did you see the new rug?

33:04.650 --> 33:07.319
Yes, and you
were so right.

33:07.353 --> 33:11.057
Sometimes you just have to toss
things out that don't belong.

33:11.090 --> 33:13.125
Daddy, may I speak
to you alone please?
Well,

33:13.159 --> 33:15.461
c-can it wait till after dinner?
Oh, a-and by the way,

33:15.494 --> 33:17.663
since you have your own
place now, we have decided

33:17.696 --> 33:19.465
we're gonna convert your room
to Shelby's office.

33:19.498 --> 33:21.233
That way, she can,
you know...

33:21.267 --> 33:23.769
Redecorate it using your
credit cards? Absolutely not.

33:23.802 --> 33:25.371
I will not allow
her to use you

33:25.404 --> 33:28.107
as a solution
to her one-woman fiscal cliff.

33:28.140 --> 33:31.410
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Lemonade,
what is going on?

33:31.443 --> 33:33.612
Shelby has put up her condo
for sale in Pensacola.

33:33.645 --> 33:35.681
And do you know why?

33:35.714 --> 33:38.084
Because, if she doesn't sell
it in the next 30 days,

33:38.117 --> 33:39.185
she is going into foreclosure.

33:39.218 --> 33:41.620
And maybe you wouldn't be
so financially strapped

33:41.653 --> 33:43.222
if you laid off
the feather boas!

33:53.332 --> 33:55.701
Daddy, I'm sorry that the truth
had to come out like that,

33:55.734 --> 33:57.303
but...

33:57.336 --> 33:58.570
it had to be done.

33:59.871 --> 34:01.107
And you're welcome.

34:01.140 --> 34:02.841
I have no words

34:02.874 --> 34:06.578
for how disappointed I am in you
for behaving like this.

34:06.612 --> 34:08.147
What?
I know all about

34:08.179 --> 34:10.282
Shelby's financial troubles.

34:10.315 --> 34:12.551
You do?
Of course I do.

34:12.583 --> 34:15.721
Shelby and I, we-we have an open
and an honest relationship.

34:15.754 --> 34:17.822
In fact, she was the one
who insisted on a prenup

34:17.856 --> 34:19.024
if we got married--

34:19.056 --> 34:21.827
to ensure that you and your
sister would not be saddled

34:21.860 --> 34:25.464
with her... her so-called
"fiscal cliff."

34:27.733 --> 34:31.570
I better not lose
my RAV4 over this.

34:33.539 --> 34:35.274
(sighs)

34:44.815 --> 34:46.818
Found the lockbox.

34:48.353 --> 34:50.356
Turns out it wasn't stolen
after all.

34:50.389 --> 34:52.690
(sighs)

34:53.891 --> 34:55.494
I'm sorry.

34:55.527 --> 34:59.365
Look, Lavon,
I get it, all right?

34:59.398 --> 35:03.869
I get that I... lost the only
girl that ever meant...

35:03.902 --> 35:07.873
anything to me
and I'll never get her back,

35:07.906 --> 35:09.675
and I have to live with that.

35:09.708 --> 35:12.644
And as a bonus to the most

35:12.678 --> 35:16.648
glorious screw-up of my already
gloriously screwed up life,

35:16.682 --> 35:20.652
I get that on top of losing
the best girl I ever had,

35:20.686 --> 35:23.655
now I've lost the best friend
I ever had, and, uh...

35:23.689 --> 35:25.257
Whoa, whoa.
Hey, hey.

35:25.291 --> 35:27.259
You didn't lose me.

35:27.293 --> 35:29.328
I mean, how could you lose me?

35:29.361 --> 35:31.597
A) I'm six and a half feet tall.

35:31.630 --> 35:33.665
You know what I mean.

35:33.699 --> 35:36.568
Wade, you hurt someone
I care about.

35:36.602 --> 35:38.437
And worse,
you hurt yourself.

35:38.470 --> 35:40.539
But come on, man, we'll...

35:40.572 --> 35:42.308
we'll get through this.

35:42.341 --> 35:44.576
We have to.

35:44.610 --> 35:47.179
I can barely change
my own lightbulb anymore.

35:51.617 --> 35:55.421
Hey. Give me something
strong enough to make me forget

35:55.454 --> 35:56.922
about the past 12 hours.

35:56.955 --> 35:58.890
If it works,
let me know.

35:58.924 --> 36:01.727
Zoe, what are you doing here?

36:01.760 --> 36:03.929
Trying to forget
the past 12 hours.

36:03.962 --> 36:05.664
Did I not make that clear?

36:05.697 --> 36:08.467
Ah. Post-Wade breakup blues?

36:08.500 --> 36:09.735
You know,
alcohol is so not fair.

36:09.768 --> 36:12.604
It makes you feel better, and
then it makes you feel worse.

36:12.638 --> 36:14.373
Hey, kind of like Wade.

36:14.406 --> 36:17.376
Oops, need more alcohol.
No, uh...

36:17.409 --> 36:19.278
I just wanted
to feel better.

36:19.311 --> 36:21.313
I had to make a choice:
either to hate

36:21.347 --> 36:24.916
or to do the long, hard thing
and work through my sadness,

36:24.950 --> 36:26.518
and guess which one I chose.

36:26.552 --> 36:28.687
(sighs)
You're telling me.
Hating is so much easier.

36:28.720 --> 36:29.755
Isn't it?
Yes.

36:29.788 --> 36:31.457
I couldn't let just me
be a hater.

36:31.490 --> 36:34.593
I had to spread it around, prove
that Max was cheating on Rose.

36:34.626 --> 36:35.861
For the record? Not.

36:35.894 --> 36:37.829
Yeah, and I spent my entire day
trying to prove

36:37.863 --> 36:40.932
that Shelby had ulterior motives
for dating my father. Also not.

36:40.966 --> 36:43.702
Well, I understand how a person
like you could be cynical.

36:43.735 --> 36:45.504
I mean, your mother
did abandon you.

36:45.537 --> 36:47.673
Well, what about you?
Your father abandoned you.

36:47.706 --> 36:49.308
And your father
worked all the time.

36:49.341 --> 36:50.676
And your mother
never supported you.

36:50.709 --> 36:51.977
George left you at the altar.

36:52.010 --> 36:53.712
And Wade cheated on you!

36:53.745 --> 36:55.714
Yes! He did!
(groans)

36:55.747 --> 36:57.949
You know, if only
there was a magic pill

36:57.983 --> 36:59.718
that could just make
you feel better.

36:59.751 --> 37:01.820
Forget the alcohol-- someone
should come up with that.

37:01.853 --> 37:03.755
I mean, they would be,
like, a bazillionaire.

37:03.789 --> 37:05.324
(laughs)

37:05.357 --> 37:06.858
(sighs)

37:06.892 --> 37:09.328
Listen, we're not friends,

37:09.361 --> 37:11.797
so I'm not gonna
hug you or anything, but...

37:11.830 --> 37:13.799
I will tell you this.

37:13.832 --> 37:17.336
Even though there's no
magic pill for your pain...

37:17.369 --> 37:19.004
you find a way to go on.

37:19.037 --> 37:21.740
And once you go on
long enough,

37:21.773 --> 37:23.542
you will get over it.

37:23.575 --> 37:25.010
I'm living proof.

37:25.043 --> 37:26.478
LILY ANNE:
Hey.

37:26.512 --> 37:28.914
A shout-out to my soul sister,
Miss Zoe Hart.

37:28.947 --> 37:32.017
To no more toenails
on your couch.

37:34.386 --> 37:36.755
* This little white dress
and fantasy *

37:36.788 --> 37:39.858
* Is not the moon you promised

37:39.891 --> 37:42.761
* To hang for me

37:42.794 --> 37:44.896
* You disgust me

37:44.930 --> 37:47.499
* Wade, you, you disgust me

37:47.533 --> 37:50.769
BOTH: We should go now.
* You're the nose
hair of humanity *

37:50.802 --> 37:53.839
* You ravaged me
emotionally *

37:53.872 --> 37:57.042
* You disgust me,
you disgust me, you disgust me *

37:57.075 --> 37:59.511
* Whoa, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh.

38:11.823 --> 38:13.559
What, no bonfire today?

38:14.693 --> 38:17.396
Isn't there just one corner
in this town

38:17.429 --> 38:18.797
where someone can be alone?

38:18.830 --> 38:21.032
Man, that is a
good question.

38:21.066 --> 38:23.469
Still battling
the breakup blues, huh?

38:23.502 --> 38:24.603
Please just go away.

38:24.636 --> 38:27.673
Sorry. I'm bound by sacred oath
to help those in pain.

38:27.706 --> 38:29.775
(chuckles)
Or...

38:29.808 --> 38:31.777
something like that.
I don't know.

38:31.810 --> 38:34.045
I was really hungover
when I took my Hippocratic oath.

38:34.079 --> 38:35.481
Shocking.

38:37.983 --> 38:39.785
What you don't
know about me...

38:40.819 --> 38:42.421
...I can juggle.

38:42.454 --> 38:44.823
There are oranges
in my pocket.

38:44.856 --> 38:47.426
(chuckles)
Oh, look at that.

38:47.459 --> 38:49.428
Tell me this isn't
cheering you up.

38:49.461 --> 38:51.096
'Cause I know
it's turning you on.

38:51.129 --> 38:54.099
Look, Jonah, I-I really
appreciate this, but...

38:54.132 --> 38:55.501
You're still sad.

38:55.534 --> 38:57.369
I see that.

38:58.404 --> 39:00.506
Well,

39:00.539 --> 39:01.707
you really have no other choice.

39:01.740 --> 39:03.108
There's only one thing
left to try.

39:05.010 --> 39:06.378
Come on. Why not?

39:09.481 --> 39:10.716
Okay.

39:10.749 --> 39:12.451
It's okay.
You can trust me.

39:12.484 --> 39:13.852
I'm a doctor.

39:19.891 --> 39:21.126
Hi.

39:21.159 --> 39:24.029
Can I talk to you?

39:24.062 --> 39:25.964
Don't worry.

39:25.997 --> 39:27.399
I don't have any baked goods.

39:27.433 --> 39:28.734
(chuckles)

39:28.767 --> 39:32.471
So, turns out Shelby
wasn't a gold digger after all.

39:32.504 --> 39:33.605
Oh.

39:33.639 --> 39:36.542
Well, that must have been fun.

39:38.209 --> 39:41.012
Listen, I-I realize
that my distrust of people

39:41.046 --> 39:43.114
may have been come by naturally,

39:43.148 --> 39:46.452
but it's still mine
to keep or lose,

39:46.485 --> 39:49.755
and I choose not
to blame anyone anymore.

39:49.788 --> 39:51.490
So...

39:51.523 --> 39:53.892
as far as our wedding goes,

39:53.925 --> 39:56.795
I absolve you.

39:59.798 --> 40:00.932
Really?

40:02.668 --> 40:04.770
Well, thank you.
Of course, if Daddy

40:04.803 --> 40:06.938
ends up getting married
to Shelby, it will be your fault

40:06.972 --> 40:08.774
for breaking up with her
and making it possible.

40:08.807 --> 40:10.676
Oh, so now... now you get
to hold that over me. Okay.

40:10.709 --> 40:11.877
All right.
Yep,

40:11.910 --> 40:13.679
for all of eternity.

40:34.265 --> 40:36.468
(sighs)

40:51.750 --> 40:52.918
Hey.
Hey.

40:52.951 --> 40:55.186
Some things that you left
at my place.

40:55.220 --> 40:57.523
A few things might be missing

40:57.556 --> 40:59.691
or a little singed
around the edges.

40:59.725 --> 41:01.593
I won't ask.

41:01.627 --> 41:03.995
(sighs)

41:04.029 --> 41:06.532
This doesn't mean
that I forgive you,

41:06.565 --> 41:09.200
but with time,

41:09.234 --> 41:12.103
I will figure out a way
to move on.

41:13.539 --> 41:16.842
Oh, and even though
I don't like you right now,

41:16.875 --> 41:19.611
I don't hate you,

41:19.645 --> 41:23.582
and I just thought
that you should know that.

41:23.615 --> 41:26.484
See you around.
See you around.
