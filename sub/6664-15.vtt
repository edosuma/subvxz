00:00.066 --> 00:02.801
Adult adam:
<i> Ah, the toy crazes</i>
<i> of the '80s.</i>

00:02.803 --> 00:05.204
<i> G.I. Joe, laser tag,</i>
<i> rubik's cube,</i>

00:05.206 --> 00:07.172
<i> Transformers,</i>
<i> care bears.</i>

00:07.174 --> 00:10.175
<i> But the mother of them all</i>
<i> were the cabbage patch kids...</i>

00:10.177 --> 00:11.710
<i> Chubby-cheeked</i>
<i> balls of cuteness</i>

00:11.712 --> 00:14.146
<i> You could adopt</i>
<i> as your very own.</i>

00:14.148 --> 00:18.851
<i> And I got mine</i>
<i> in a most unusual way.</i>

00:18.853 --> 00:19.585
In my hand,

00:19.587 --> 00:22.588
I hold your final exam
for health class...

00:22.590 --> 00:24.656
The reality of parenting.

00:24.658 --> 00:27.092
Wow. How many
of these do you own?

00:27.094 --> 00:27.860
You know,
I'm not married,

00:27.862 --> 00:30.162
And I'm severely allergic
to cat and dog dander,

00:30.164 --> 00:34.166
So I guess you could say
these are like my children.

00:34.168 --> 00:37.803
Ha! That's a joke.
I'm fine.

00:37.805 --> 00:38.237
Okay.

00:38.239 --> 00:40.806
So, for this assignment,
you are going to pair up

00:40.808 --> 00:42.574
And you're going
to tend to the child

00:42.576 --> 00:43.809
As if it's a real baby.

00:43.811 --> 00:46.512
And every 30 minutes,
you're gonna
spin the wheel

00:46.514 --> 00:47.746
And do the assigned chore.

00:47.748 --> 00:48.547
Feeding, burping, diapering.

00:48.549 --> 00:50.249
You get it...
The things that
married couples do.

00:50.251 --> 00:55.320
Or... So I've seen
from my three married
younger sisters.

00:56.923 --> 00:59.058
Okay, partner up.

00:59.060 --> 00:59.725
Dana isabelle caldwell,

00:59.727 --> 01:02.027
Will you be
the mother
of my cabbage?

01:02.029 --> 01:04.396
I don't know.
I don't want this to make
things weird between us.

01:04.398 --> 01:07.466
Trust me...
A baby only
makes things better.

01:07.468 --> 01:08.534
It's like
the old saying...

01:08.536 --> 01:10.369
"if your relationship sucks,
a baby will fix it."

01:10.371 --> 01:12.871
Adult adam: <i> Okay, so, maybe</i>
<i> I was way off about that,</i>

01:12.873 --> 01:14.206
<i> But I did know</i>
<i> that this project</i>

01:14.208 --> 01:17.709
<i> Was the perfect way</i>
<i> for me to get</i>
<i> closer to dana.</i>

01:17.711 --> 01:18.243
(laughs)

01:18.245 --> 01:20.012
Welcome to our tree home,
my dear.

01:20.014 --> 01:21.880
I've already
put down the baby

01:21.882 --> 01:23.615
And whipped us
up some supper.

01:23.617 --> 01:26.051
Aww. Smurf ravioli...
My favorite.

01:26.053 --> 01:28.554
Well, only the best
for my girl dana

01:28.556 --> 01:30.355
And our little angel, ripley.

01:30.357 --> 01:33.325
Ripley?
It's a classic
girl's name.

01:33.327 --> 01:34.126
Also happens to be

01:34.128 --> 01:36.295
Sigourney weaver's
badass character
in <i> "aliens."</i>

01:36.297 --> 01:39.631
How about one
that'll make us
both happy?

01:39.633 --> 01:40.866
Leia.

01:40.868 --> 01:43.836
Leia delorean goldberg!

01:43.838 --> 01:44.303
I love it!

01:44.305 --> 01:47.806
Snuggle boo-boo!
Dinner's ready!

01:47.808 --> 01:48.507
What is all this?

01:48.509 --> 01:51.743
Health class.
We got to care
for a pretend baby.

01:51.745 --> 01:55.013
Oh, I'm finally
a grandma, huh?

01:55.015 --> 01:55.781
(laughs)

01:55.783 --> 01:58.083
Well, move over.
Isn't this fun?

01:58.085 --> 01:59.218
Come on.
Let me hold her.

01:59.220 --> 02:01.954
Actually, um,
we're not supposed
to get any

02:01.956 --> 02:03.222
Outside help
with leia.

02:03.224 --> 02:05.824
"leia"?
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

02:05.826 --> 02:07.426
That's so boring and plain.

02:07.428 --> 02:11.730
What about "myrna,"
after your great-grandma?

02:14.334 --> 02:15.634
Um, maybe.

02:15.636 --> 02:16.602
Yeah, I mean,

02:16.604 --> 02:18.770
It was a name in progress...

02:18.772 --> 02:20.005
Was it?

02:20.007 --> 02:21.874
Everyone agrees.
Myrna it is.

02:21.876 --> 02:23.375
Okay,
I get how this works.

02:23.377 --> 02:26.011
We spin the thing
and do the thingy.
(gasps)

02:26.013 --> 02:27.312
(sing song)
<i> ¶ baby's got poo-poos ¶</i>

02:27.314 --> 02:30.649
Let me change her.
Actually,
we're good. Thanks.

02:30.651 --> 02:32.017
Oh.

02:32.019 --> 02:33.785
Oh.

02:35.455 --> 02:36.922
Oh.

02:36.924 --> 02:39.691
Well, uh, I'm gonna go
check in on your father.

02:39.693 --> 02:40.592
I'm sure
he still needs me.

02:40.594 --> 02:44.229
Adult adam: <i> As usual,</i>
<i> my smother had jammed</i>
<i> herself into my life</i>

02:44.231 --> 02:45.464
<i> And made it</i>
<i> real awkward real quick.</i>

02:45.466 --> 02:48.800
<i> I had to do some</i>
<i> epic damage control...</i>
<i> And fast.</i>

02:48.802 --> 02:52.804
How about a toast
to the world's greatest mom?

02:53.373 --> 02:55.040
Somebody call me?

02:55.108 --> 02:56.508
No?

02:57.877 --> 02:59.978
Okay.
(chuckles)

03:02.482 --> 03:03.749
<i> ¶ I'm twisted up inside</i>

03:03.751 --> 03:07.452
<i> ¶ but nonetheless</i>
<i> I feel the need to say</i>

03:09.455 --> 03:10.856
<i> ¶ I don't know the future</i>

03:10.858 --> 03:14.426
<i> ¶ but the past keeps getting</i>
<i> clearer every day ¶</i>

03:14.428 --> 03:16.328
Adult adam:
<i> It was March 10th,</i>
<i> 1980-something,</i>

03:16.330 --> 03:19.364
<i> And barry was chiling</i>
<i> with his best</i>
<i> and only friends,</i>

03:19.366 --> 03:22.968
<i> The jenkin town posse...</i>
<i> Also known as the jtp.</i>

03:22.970 --> 03:23.669
All right, batter up.

03:23.671 --> 03:27.239
I got, uh, an egg,
a grapefruit,
and a light bulb.

03:27.241 --> 03:29.274
Grapefruit! Let's go, baby!
Come on! Game on.

03:29.276 --> 03:31.643
All: (chanting)
smash ball! Smash ball!

03:31.645 --> 03:33.045
Smash ball!

03:33.047 --> 03:34.580
(all screaming)

03:34.582 --> 03:37.216
Dude, the citrus
is burning my eyes!

03:37.218 --> 03:38.984
I can't see!
That's awesome!

03:38.986 --> 03:39.718
Barry goldberg,

03:39.720 --> 03:42.821
King of smash ball
and king of the jtp!

03:42.823 --> 03:44.256
All: Jtp!

03:44.258 --> 03:45.857
(all cheering)

03:45.859 --> 03:47.593
This was fun.
See ya.

03:47.595 --> 03:49.061
Wai... What?
What?

03:49.063 --> 03:49.795
You just got here, man.

03:49.797 --> 03:51.063
You said tonight was
gonna be legendary.

03:51.065 --> 03:54.266
Sorry, guys.
I made plans
with my special lady.

03:54.268 --> 03:55.200
What happened to you, bro?

03:55.202 --> 03:56.635
Since that girl
came into your life,

03:56.637 --> 03:58.403
It's like
we don't even exist, man.

03:58.405 --> 04:01.473
Yeah, dude.
It's time you made
a choice.

04:01.475 --> 04:02.040
It's either us

04:02.042 --> 04:05.177
Or the super-hot,
popular girl that
you make out with.

04:05.179 --> 04:07.779
Her. 100% her.

04:09.115 --> 04:10.716
(sighs)

04:12.418 --> 04:13.185
Lainey? You're here?

04:13.187 --> 04:15.621
I've been calling
your house for
the last two hours!

04:15.623 --> 04:18.290
We have to get ready
for anthony balsamo's party.

04:18.292 --> 04:19.891
God, I'm so sorry, erica.

04:19.893 --> 04:20.926
I totally forgot.

04:20.928 --> 04:22.794
Me 'n' bar decided
we were gonna stay in

04:22.796 --> 04:24.196
And have a romantic
evening together.

04:24.198 --> 04:26.865
I've been holding
in a fart this whole time.

04:26.867 --> 04:27.366
Aww.

04:27.368 --> 04:30.035
Well, I can't just go
to the party by myself.

04:30.037 --> 04:30.869
That's pathetic.

04:30.871 --> 04:33.472
(whispers) it is pathetic.
Invite her to
watch with us.

04:33.474 --> 04:35.941
I'd rather not.
I find she sucks.

04:35.943 --> 04:37.943
I can hear you.
And you suck.

04:37.945 --> 04:40.879
Lainey, next Friday
we're hanging out.
No excuses.

04:40.881 --> 04:44.349
Ooh, my girl's
gonna be busy that night.

04:44.984 --> 04:46.018
Tickets to
the heart concert?

04:46.020 --> 04:49.054
No way! Lainey and I
have been talking
about going for months!

04:49.056 --> 04:53.292
Which is how I knew
it'd score me major points
to get us tickets.

04:53.294 --> 04:56.295
I can't believe
you pulled this off.

04:56.297 --> 04:57.496
You are the best!

04:57.498 --> 04:59.631
Oh, my god.
What is that smell?

05:01.968 --> 05:02.401
Hey, guys?

05:02.403 --> 05:04.403
Things have been
kind of weird with dana.

05:04.405 --> 05:06.371
Thought I should
ask you about it.

05:06.373 --> 05:07.205
Sure thing, kiddo.

05:07.207 --> 05:08.507
(tv shuts off)
happy to help.

05:08.509 --> 05:10.075
And I, also, am here.

05:10.077 --> 05:11.576
Why is dana
super-pissed at me

05:11.578 --> 05:13.211
For siding
with mom over her

05:13.213 --> 05:14.780
When it comes to
raising kids?

05:14.782 --> 05:16.748
You never side
with your mother

05:16.750 --> 05:18.016
Over your lady,
you moron.

05:18.018 --> 05:20.719
Pack up your toys
and move to another town.

05:20.721 --> 05:22.954
The life you've
built here is over.

05:22.956 --> 05:24.990
But it's like
what mom always says,

05:24.992 --> 05:26.058
"happy mom, happy life."

05:26.060 --> 05:30.395
No! The phrase is
"happy wife, happy life."

05:30.397 --> 05:31.229
It rhymes!

05:31.231 --> 05:34.566
I thought "happy mom,
happy life" was clunky!

05:34.568 --> 05:36.001
I'm such a putz!

05:36.003 --> 05:37.035
(doorbell rings)

05:37.037 --> 05:38.337
Ohh, it's dana.
What do I tell her?

05:38.339 --> 05:41.440
That she's calling
the shots in
your relationship.

05:41.442 --> 05:45.344
You hear me?
Now, tell her,
damn you!

05:45.845 --> 05:46.778
Hey. It's getting late,

05:46.780 --> 05:49.715
So we should
feed (sighs) myrna.

05:49.717 --> 05:50.949
Actually,
I've been thinking.

05:50.951 --> 05:52.684
Let's go with leia...
The name you want.

05:52.686 --> 05:55.087
Really?
What about
your mom?

05:55.089 --> 05:56.922
Hey, this is
your cabbage patch,

05:56.924 --> 05:59.091
And I completely
and fully support

05:59.093 --> 06:02.494
Your decisions
on all matters.

06:02.795 --> 06:03.295
Thank you.

06:03.297 --> 06:05.130
I mean, I totally appreciate
your mom wanting to help,

06:05.132 --> 06:07.299
But she needs to know
it's our project.

06:07.301 --> 06:08.633
Exactly.
So you'll let her know?

06:08.635 --> 06:11.269
Know what, now?
You know,
to stay out of it.

06:11.271 --> 06:13.772
Set some boundaries.
Boundaries? Whoa.

06:13.774 --> 06:16.274
Uh, you know my mom.
That's a big ask.

06:16.276 --> 06:17.943
I...Guess
<i> I</i> could talk to her.

06:17.945 --> 06:19.978
Adam: You know what? Yeah.
That's perfect.

06:19.980 --> 06:21.380
She's in the kitchen
right now.

06:21.382 --> 06:26.651
Adult adam: <i> I not only</i>
<i> took their advice,</i>
<i> I hit it out of the park.</i>

06:26.653 --> 06:27.219
Are you nuts?

06:27.221 --> 06:29.888
You never let
your mother
and your wife

06:29.890 --> 06:32.591
Hash things out
with each other.

06:32.593 --> 06:33.759
You got to be
the buffer.

06:33.761 --> 06:35.761
Otherwise,
it spirals into chaos.

06:35.763 --> 06:39.531
Okay, you guys need
to tell me this
great advice

06:39.533 --> 06:40.632
Before I fudge the bed!

06:40.634 --> 06:43.135
Adult adam:
<i> While I was running off</i>
<i> to save my relationship,</i>

06:43.137 --> 06:47.272
<i> The jtp was still mourning</i>
<i> the loss of barry goldberg.</i>

06:47.274 --> 06:49.274
Dudes, it's barry's
bananas hot sister.

06:49.276 --> 06:51.443
Okay, be cool.
Let the ladies' man
handle this.

06:51.445 --> 06:54.479
(clears throat) hey!

06:55.615 --> 06:57.416
I'm panicking.
Someone take over.

06:57.418 --> 06:58.884
Uh...

06:58.886 --> 06:59.651
Greetings, m'lady.

06:59.653 --> 07:02.120
Uh, what doth bring thou
to our domain?

07:02.122 --> 07:06.291
So, this is where you
guys hang out
all the time, huh?

07:06.293 --> 07:06.958
What do you do here?

07:06.960 --> 07:09.327
Do you want to play
smash ball with us?

07:09.329 --> 07:10.562
I really don't.

07:10.564 --> 07:12.898
All: (chanting)
smash ball. Smash ball.

07:12.900 --> 07:15.033
Smash ball! Smash ball!
Smash ball! Smash ball!

07:15.035 --> 07:16.835
Okay! Okay!
Stop saying
"smash ball."

07:16.837 --> 07:19.037
Fine. I'll play
your weird game.

07:19.039 --> 07:19.905
(laughs) whoo!

07:19.907 --> 07:22.140
Okay. In there.
Not gonna touch you.

07:22.142 --> 07:23.108
It's over there.
Okay.

07:23.110 --> 07:24.476
And then...
Lettuce.

07:24.478 --> 07:25.644
Got it. All right.

07:25.646 --> 07:27.312
Um, okay.

07:27.314 --> 07:29.114
Let's go. Let's go.

07:29.116 --> 07:31.583
Ohh!
(laughing)

07:31.585 --> 07:32.818
Adult adam:
<i> And just like that,</i>

07:32.820 --> 07:36.555
<i> Erica swung her way</i>
<i> into the hearts of the jtp.</i>

07:37.857 --> 07:39.257
Ohh!
Ohh!

07:39.259 --> 07:40.826
(all grunting)

07:40.828 --> 07:42.894
(laughing)

07:43.062 --> 07:44.596
Big e!

07:44.598 --> 07:46.565
Yes!
Whoo!

07:46.567 --> 07:48.800
So, you guys going
to anthony balsamo's party?

07:48.802 --> 07:50.635
Hell, yeah!
Par-tay!

07:50.637 --> 07:51.670
Balsamo!

07:51.672 --> 07:53.104
So, you guys
don't know
about it, then?

07:53.106 --> 07:55.273
No, what's...
No, we don't.
Where is that?

07:55.275 --> 07:55.907
Balsamo.

07:55.909 --> 07:57.843
Well, I guess
you guys can tag along...

07:57.845 --> 07:59.478
If you don't act weird

07:59.480 --> 08:00.779
And naked rob
doesn't get naked.

08:00.781 --> 08:04.850
That's cool.
I only get naked
around dudes.

08:06.118 --> 08:08.553
Adult adam:
<i> After a surprisingly</i>
<i> fun night</i>

08:08.555 --> 08:09.387
<i> With barry's friends,</i>

08:09.389 --> 08:11.523
<i> My sister</i>
<i> formulated a plan</i>

08:11.525 --> 08:13.992
<i> To reclaim her friend</i>
<i> from barry.</i>

08:13.994 --> 08:15.360
Yo, big e!
Over here!

08:15.362 --> 08:16.895
Rob: Oh, dude,
she's coming over.

08:16.897 --> 08:18.630
What the hell
is she doing?

08:18.632 --> 08:20.532
Looks like
she joined the jtp.

08:20.534 --> 08:21.366
Jtp!

08:21.368 --> 08:22.834
All: Jtp!

08:22.836 --> 08:24.269
No. No way!

08:24.271 --> 08:29.140
You can't say "jtp"
unless you're in the jtp.

08:29.142 --> 08:30.675
Which is why she said it.

08:30.677 --> 08:32.511
And you're out, bro.

08:32.513 --> 08:33.211
We got a new leader...

08:33.213 --> 08:35.046
One who actually
gets us into
cool parties.

08:35.048 --> 08:37.215
Wait... You took them
to anthony balsamo's party?

08:37.217 --> 08:40.652
You were too busy
running your hands over
barry's lumpy melon.

08:40.654 --> 08:42.020
Nice burn, big e.

08:42.022 --> 08:43.355
You can't call her
"big e."

08:43.357 --> 08:46.057
That's way too close
to "big tasty."

08:46.059 --> 08:47.492
It'll cause
marketplace confusion!

08:47.494 --> 08:51.930
I'm sorry, bar, but it looks
like big e's in charge now.

08:51.998 --> 08:53.265
Jtp out.

08:53.267 --> 08:54.799
All: Jtp out!

08:54.801 --> 08:56.535
Jtp out.

08:56.903 --> 08:57.669
Aw, sweetie.

08:57.671 --> 09:00.839
You're not allowed
to say that anymore.

09:03.175 --> 09:05.343
Adult adam: <i> I thought</i>
<i> raising a fake baby</i>
<i> with dana</i>

09:05.345 --> 09:07.846
<i> Would bring us together,</i>
<i> but it was only</i>
<i> pushing apart.</i>

09:07.848 --> 09:11.483
Hey. You would not
believe the day I've had.

09:11.485 --> 09:12.918
Don't care.
Just take her.

09:12.920 --> 09:14.386
Whoa, whoa.
What's this?

09:14.388 --> 09:15.754
At least let me
walk through the door.

09:15.756 --> 09:17.889
I've been here dealing
with the baby all by myself.

09:17.891 --> 09:20.859
This assignment's
impossible.
Where were you?

09:20.861 --> 09:22.060
Out mowing lawns.

09:22.062 --> 09:23.995
You know...
My job.

09:23.997 --> 09:25.463
Nice try.
I called mrs. Bales.

09:25.465 --> 09:26.231
That ended two hours ago.

09:26.233 --> 09:29.768
I went to the arcade
to blow off steam
with some buddies.

09:29.770 --> 09:31.736
And why are you
even checking up on me?

09:31.738 --> 09:33.271
I played one game and left.

09:33.273 --> 09:34.005
One game? Please.

09:34.007 --> 09:35.540
I smell pizza
on your breath.

09:35.542 --> 09:38.810
It's not my fault.
I didn't even
ask for this kid!

09:38.812 --> 09:40.145
(gasps)

09:40.147 --> 09:41.246
Okay.

09:41.248 --> 09:42.714
This is super-weird.

09:42.716 --> 09:45.517
Maybe we should
just take a break
from all of this.

09:45.519 --> 09:47.819
And go to a movie
or something.

09:47.821 --> 09:49.321
Just us... No baby.

09:49.323 --> 09:50.121
We can get a sitter.

09:50.123 --> 09:51.756
Adult adam:
<i> And so we did</i>
<i> get a sitter...</i>

09:51.758 --> 09:53.892
<i> A man who had been</i>
<i> sitting on his ass</i>

09:53.894 --> 09:55.427
<i> For as long</i>
<i> as I could remember.</i>

09:55.429 --> 09:57.429
<i> Unfortunately,</i>
<i> my mom wasn't one</i>

09:57.431 --> 10:00.165
<i> To sit on the sidelines</i>
<i> of any situation.</i>

10:00.967 --> 10:03.268
What's that?
What's what?

10:03.270 --> 10:05.036
The little foot
sticking out.

10:05.038 --> 10:06.037
Just adam's baby.

10:06.039 --> 10:08.139
I'm using it
for lumbar support.

10:08.141 --> 10:12.577
Did they entrust the baby
to you over me?

10:14.614 --> 10:16.314
Over me?

10:17.316 --> 10:18.750
Ow!

10:20.519 --> 10:20.919
Ow!

10:20.921 --> 10:23.254
You do know
none of this
is real?

10:23.256 --> 10:25.490
Oh, it's real.
Don't you get it?

10:25.492 --> 10:27.792
This is how adam
is gonna treat me

10:27.794 --> 10:28.860
When I really am a bubbie.

10:28.862 --> 10:32.864
I'm gonna prove to him
that I'm the best
grandma ever.

10:32.866 --> 10:35.300
Adult adam: <i> "grandma,"</i>
<i> "gam-gam," "bubbie"...</i>

10:35.302 --> 10:36.668
<i> Didn't matter</i>
<i> what she went by.</i>

10:36.670 --> 10:38.803
<i> My mom was determined</i>
<i> to be the best.</i>

10:38.805 --> 10:40.772
<i> She changed the toy.</i>
<i> She fed it.</i>

10:40.774 --> 10:42.841
<i> She even took it</i>
<i> to the park.</i>

10:42.843 --> 10:45.110
Ohh!
Your baby's so cute.

10:45.112 --> 10:47.045
Aww.
And yours is...

10:47.213 --> 10:49.514
Oh, boy.
Thank you.

10:52.051 --> 10:52.884
<i> Yep.</i>

10:52.886 --> 10:54.019
<i> My mom was on her way</i>

10:54.021 --> 10:56.421
<i> To helping us get an "a"</i>
<i> on this assignment...</i>

10:56.423 --> 10:59.624
<i> Until a dog mistook</i>
<i> the baby for a chew toy.</i>

11:02.695 --> 11:04.029
My baby.

11:04.031 --> 11:05.730
Somebody stole my baby!

11:05.732 --> 11:08.333
Well, not real baby...
Fake baby. It's a toy.

11:08.335 --> 11:09.034
Somebody stole my toy!

11:09.036 --> 11:13.171
I'm gonna get attitude
from my son's
pretend wife!

11:13.173 --> 11:16.241
Can someone
call the police?

11:16.243 --> 11:17.375
Or toys "r" us?

11:17.377 --> 11:18.276
I don't (bleep) know anymore!

11:18.278 --> 11:20.912
Adult adam: <i> As my mom</i>
<i> was realizing</i>
<i> she had to figure out</i>

11:20.914 --> 11:22.714
<i> How to replace</i>
<i> our little angel,</i>

11:22.716 --> 11:27.185
<i> Barry was learning</i>
<i> just how replaceable</i>
<i> he was.</i>

11:27.187 --> 11:28.620
No way.

11:29.555 --> 11:30.455
<i> "brian's song"?</i>

11:30.457 --> 11:32.691
That's our
secret guy-cry movie!

11:32.693 --> 11:35.126
Beat it, bar.
This is just jtp.

11:35.128 --> 11:36.394
All: Jtp.

11:36.396 --> 11:38.096
Get over here.
Get over here.

11:38.098 --> 11:41.466
You can't just use my friends
as pawns in your sick game.

11:41.468 --> 11:45.036
You can have
your precious jtp
back anytime you want.

11:45.038 --> 11:47.539
Just stop hanging out
with lainey.

11:47.541 --> 11:48.506
Your move.

11:48.508 --> 11:50.775
Adult adam:
<i> But, unfortunately</i>
<i> for erica,</i>

11:50.777 --> 11:53.044
<i> The next move</i>
<i> was not barry's.</i>

11:53.046 --> 11:54.079
Gah!
What are you...

11:54.081 --> 11:55.013
I came for a root beer, too.

11:55.015 --> 11:57.148
It's crazy
how we had
the same idea.

11:57.150 --> 12:00.785
It's like...
It's like fate, right?

12:01.387 --> 12:02.687
Here, let me...

12:02.689 --> 12:08.126
<i> ¶ till now,</i>
<i> I always got by on my own</i>

12:08.594 --> 12:13.498
<i> ¶ I never really cared</i>
<i> until I met you ¶</i>

12:13.833 --> 12:14.999
What?

12:15.001 --> 12:15.867
(music stops)

12:15.869 --> 12:17.635
We should probably
get back to the movie.

12:17.637 --> 12:19.771
Everyone's probably
wondering where we are.

12:19.773 --> 12:22.207
We've been gone
three minutes.

12:22.209 --> 12:24.142
It feels like forever.

12:28.781 --> 12:29.280
(sighs)

12:29.282 --> 12:33.918
Such a beautiful movie
about friendship
and football and...

12:34.253 --> 12:35.520
I'll get you a...

12:35.522 --> 12:39.491
<i> ¶ till now,</i>
<i> I always got by... ¶</i>

12:39.493 --> 12:41.025
Wow.

12:41.193 --> 12:43.027
We both went for the...

12:43.029 --> 12:44.863
What are the odds?

12:44.865 --> 12:46.531
It's crazy, right?

12:46.599 --> 12:48.066
What's happening?

12:48.068 --> 12:48.767
You tell me.

12:48.769 --> 12:50.068
<i> ¶ ...Chills me to the bone ¶</i>

12:50.070 --> 12:53.238
(music stops)
I'm just gonna go
sit over here.

12:53.240 --> 12:55.073
<i> ¶ till now</i>

12:55.075 --> 12:57.776

I'm sorry.

12:57.778 --> 12:59.410
<i> ¶ on my own</i>

12:59.412 --> 13:00.745
<i> ¶ I never really cared</i>

13:00.747 --> 13:03.648
For the first time
in a long time, I think
I'm gonna be just fine.

13:03.650 --> 13:05.550
<i> ¶ until I met you</i>

13:05.552 --> 13:07.552
<i> ¶ and now</i>
<i> it chills me to the... ¶</i>

13:07.554 --> 13:10.922
(music stops)
um, guys,
take a seat for me.

13:11.056 --> 13:11.623
(sighs)

13:11.625 --> 13:14.926
To be clear,
we're all just
friends here, right?

13:14.928 --> 13:16.861
Just friends.
<i> Amigos.</i>

13:16.863 --> 13:18.062
I love you.

13:18.064 --> 13:20.031
Okay, I'm just gonna
leave my own house now.

13:20.033 --> 13:21.199
Adult adam: <i> Across town,</i>
<i> my mom was desperate</i>

13:21.201 --> 13:24.602
<i> To save my grade</i>
<i> and her reputation</i>
<i> as a bubbie,</i>

13:24.604 --> 13:26.404
<i> But cabbage patch kids</i>
<i> were in such high demand</i>

13:26.406 --> 13:30.542
<i> That her only chance was</i>
<i> to turn to the black market.</i>

13:30.544 --> 13:31.943
Hey.

13:32.478 --> 13:33.378
You rick?

13:33.380 --> 13:35.346
Shh! No names, all right?

13:35.348 --> 13:37.615
Just be cool.
What do you need?

13:37.617 --> 13:39.551
I got glo worm,
I got voltron,

13:39.553 --> 13:40.919
I got koosa,
I got my little pony.

13:40.921 --> 13:45.323
Oh. I also have
the strongest heroine
in the world.

13:45.325 --> 13:46.057
What?

13:46.059 --> 13:48.059
She-ra,
princess of power.

13:48.061 --> 13:50.428
There's no stronger
heroine out there.

13:50.430 --> 13:51.162
I need a cabbage patch kid.

13:51.164 --> 13:52.831
Female,
red yarny hair,
blue eyes.

13:52.833 --> 13:56.134
You got
expensive taste, girl.
(chuckles)

13:56.136 --> 13:59.103
Cpks are sold out
across the country.

13:59.105 --> 14:00.171
It's gonna cost ya.

14:00.173 --> 14:03.808
(gasps) yes.
That's what bubbie needs.

14:03.810 --> 14:05.343
How much for that one?

14:05.345 --> 14:06.711
For a pretty lady
like you,

14:06.713 --> 14:10.515
I suppose I could
let one go for 3 large.

14:10.616 --> 14:13.151
$3,000?

14:13.153 --> 14:15.854
Is that...
What "large" is?

14:15.856 --> 14:17.155
I meant $300.

14:17.157 --> 14:18.423
Well,
that's still ridiculous.

14:18.425 --> 14:20.225
Adult adam: <i> As my mom</i>
<i> was trying to negotiate</i>

14:20.227 --> 14:22.660
<i> The best possible price,</i>
<i> we were about</i>
<i> to pay the price</i>

14:22.662 --> 14:25.029
<i> For not getting</i>
<i> a real babysitter.</i>

14:25.031 --> 14:27.565
Hey, dad,
how'd it go?

14:27.567 --> 14:29.567
Really, really bad.

14:30.069 --> 14:33.071
Mom...
Shhh! Baby's sleeping.

14:33.073 --> 14:35.640
Just kidding. Her eyes
are wide open all the time.

14:35.642 --> 14:37.709
But don't worry.
We had a great day.

14:37.711 --> 14:39.510
And I did everything
the spinner said.

14:39.512 --> 14:41.946
I'd say I proved
I'm an excellent bubbie.

14:41.948 --> 14:44.983
Dana: Excellent how?
Adam, look at it.

14:44.985 --> 14:46.784
Oh! Balls!

14:46.786 --> 14:48.186
This is a fake.
What did you do, mom?

14:48.188 --> 14:51.890
Okay, there are some
ugly accusations flying about,

14:51.892 --> 14:52.991
And if that's not myrna,

14:52.993 --> 14:55.660
Then I have failed
as a grandmother.

14:56.328 --> 14:58.329
Read the label.

14:58.331 --> 15:00.598
"lettuce crop child."

15:00.600 --> 15:03.001
(chuckles)
that is unfortunate.

15:03.003 --> 15:03.568
You know what?

15:03.570 --> 15:06.838
You two should
just finish this
project together.

15:07.006 --> 15:07.405
(scoffs)

15:07.407 --> 15:10.475
Wait! Don't go!
I can't be a single dad!

15:10.477 --> 15:12.210
Oh, you'll never be single

15:12.212 --> 15:14.445
As long as you have me,
schmoopie.

15:24.991 --> 15:26.591
It's from
<i> "say anything..."</i>

That's how your
dorky little brother

15:27.560 --> 15:29.427
Got a hot girl
way out of his league.

15:29.429 --> 15:31.462
That's not even
the right song!

15:31.464 --> 15:32.997
To be honest,
I never saw the movie.

15:32.999 --> 15:34.832
Stop <i> say anything</i> -ing me

15:55.255 --> 15:56.254
Yeah, well, so did I!

15:56.256 --> 15:58.222

16:16.609 --> 16:17.275
Barry: Well, well.

16:17.277 --> 16:19.711
Looks like the worm
is on the other foot.

16:19.713 --> 16:21.346
Help me!
Please make it stop!

16:21.348 --> 16:25.516
Messing with those
poor goobers to break
us up is so not cool.

16:25.518 --> 16:27.251
What was I
supposed to do?

16:27.253 --> 16:29.887
I get it.
You two make
each other happy.

16:29.889 --> 16:31.089
But I didn't know
that meant

16:31.091 --> 16:33.891
I'd lose you
and be left all alone.

16:34.893 --> 16:36.427
(sighs)

16:40.532 --> 16:41.933
Miss taraborelli: Seriously?

16:41.935 --> 16:44.802
Does this look like
a cabbage patch kid
to you?

16:44.804 --> 16:47.705
Okay, this is
a cabbage patch kid.

16:47.707 --> 16:51.476
Aww. This looks like
something in a horror movie

16:51.478 --> 16:53.144
Where the doll
comes alive and

16:53.146 --> 16:55.113
Terrorizes a lakeside town.

16:55.115 --> 16:56.848
Look, it's not
dana's fault.

16:56.850 --> 16:59.550
Please don't fail her.
Fail me.

16:59.552 --> 17:00.885
No, it's my fault.

17:00.887 --> 17:02.920
If you're gonna
fail anyone, fail me.

17:02.922 --> 17:06.557
I can't...Fail you,
mrs. Goldberg.
You're an adult.

17:06.559 --> 17:08.059
Also, why are you here?

17:08.061 --> 17:09.494
Yeah, adam.
Why is she here?

17:09.496 --> 17:11.963
I'm just trying to help,
like any good bubbie would.

17:11.965 --> 17:13.798
(softly) a good bubbie
doesn't lose her grandchild.

17:13.800 --> 17:16.634
I heard that.
Bubbies hear everything.

17:16.636 --> 17:18.269
Enough! Gah!

17:18.271 --> 17:19.737
Mom, I know you
mean well,

17:19.739 --> 17:23.274
But all you've done is
screw things up
for me and dana.

17:23.276 --> 17:25.843
Look, I don't know
when I'll have a family,

17:25.845 --> 17:27.912
And I don't know
who it'll be with.

17:27.914 --> 17:29.414
I... I... It could be dana.

17:29.416 --> 17:30.248
It could be molly ringwald.

17:30.250 --> 17:33.718
All I know is
that when I do
get married,

17:33.720 --> 17:36.854
You're gonna need
to butt out.

17:36.856 --> 17:38.556
Okay, but I...
No "buts"...

17:38.558 --> 17:41.559
Except for yours
butting out.

17:45.064 --> 17:45.797
Thanks for coming.

17:45.799 --> 17:47.665
I'm sure you're
all wondering
why I brought you here.

17:47.667 --> 17:51.302
You're gonna choose
which one of us you'll
take as your lover.

17:51.304 --> 17:51.903
Ew! God, no!

17:51.905 --> 17:54.272
I'm doing
the complete
opposite of that.

17:54.274 --> 17:56.774
I'm resigning
as leader of the jtp.

17:56.776 --> 17:57.408
All: Jtp!

17:57.410 --> 17:59.210
Did you even hear
what I said?

17:59.212 --> 18:01.379
I'm out! No more jtp!

18:01.381 --> 18:02.280
All: Jtp!

18:02.282 --> 18:04.449
God!
Allow me.

18:04.451 --> 18:05.883
Here's the deal,
fellas.

18:05.885 --> 18:07.518
You're all
so insanely
awesome

18:07.520 --> 18:10.621
That erica loves you all
equally, okay?

18:10.623 --> 18:13.458
For her
to choose one of
you would literally

18:13.460 --> 18:14.826
Break her brain in half,

18:14.828 --> 18:17.462
Sending her into
a coma forever.

18:17.464 --> 18:18.863
Oh. That makes sense.

18:18.865 --> 18:19.497
Mmm-hmm.
Yeah.

18:19.499 --> 18:21.833
Her only real option
is to step down

18:21.835 --> 18:26.404
So I can resume my role
as leader and god of the jtp.

18:26.406 --> 18:28.539
Jtp, jtp.

18:28.541 --> 18:29.974
Here.

18:29.976 --> 18:30.808
Your heart tickets?
Seriously?

18:30.810 --> 18:34.112
Think I'm gonna
hang with my boys
that night.

18:34.546 --> 18:37.315
I suggest you
hang with your girl.

18:38.050 --> 18:39.784
Want to?
Yes!

18:39.786 --> 18:40.284
(chuckles)

18:40.286 --> 18:43.387
<i> ¶ but the secret</i>
<i> is still my own ¶</i>

18:43.389 --> 18:45.356
Adult adam: <i> It was one</i>
<i> of those major life lessons</i>

18:45.358 --> 18:47.925
<i> Barry and erica</i>
<i> had to learn the hard way.</i>

18:47.927 --> 18:50.628
<i> Sometimes, you'll find</i>
<i> that special someone</i>

18:50.630 --> 18:51.629
<i> Who changes everything.</i>

18:51.631 --> 18:54.832
<i> But having</i>
<i> your best friends</i>
<i> there to cheer you on</i>

18:54.834 --> 18:57.502
<i> Is what the game</i>
<i> is all about.</i>

18:57.504 --> 18:59.003
<i> ¶ till now</i>

18:59.005 --> 19:01.305
<i> ¶ I always got by on my own ¶</i>

19:01.307 --> 19:02.940
All: Ohh!

19:02.942 --> 19:03.674
(indistinct talking)

19:03.676 --> 19:05.943
Miss taraborelli:
Mr. Goldberg,
a moment please.

19:05.945 --> 19:08.312
I've changed my mind
on your grade.

19:08.314 --> 19:08.913
Really?

19:08.915 --> 19:10.047
You know,
the point of the project

19:10.049 --> 19:11.749
Was to learn what
it's like to be
a real parent.

19:11.751 --> 19:13.518
Changing diapers...
Oh, that's easy.

19:13.520 --> 19:16.854
Protecting your lady
from her nightmare
in-laws?

19:16.856 --> 19:18.589
Whew. That's an "a."

19:18.591 --> 19:21.559
<i> ¶ how do I get you alone? ¶</i>

19:24.029 --> 19:25.663
Dana.

19:27.065 --> 19:28.633
What's all this?

19:28.635 --> 19:31.502
A thank you
for standing up for me...

19:31.504 --> 19:34.272
And an apology
for how weird things got.

19:34.274 --> 19:35.740
It got quite weird.

19:35.742 --> 19:37.241
But I give you my word...

19:37.243 --> 19:38.109
From now on,
I'm gonna make sure

19:38.111 --> 19:41.379
My mom stays as
far away from us
as possible.

19:41.381 --> 19:43.948
Actually, your mom's
not so bad.

19:43.950 --> 19:46.284
She's the one
who invited me over

19:46.286 --> 19:48.486
And helped me
with all this.

19:48.488 --> 19:49.187
Adult adam: <i> In the end,</i>

19:49.189 --> 19:51.122
<i> My mom stopped worrying</i>
<i> about being the best bubbie</i>

19:51.124 --> 19:54.692
<i> And just focused on being</i>
<i> my awesome mom.</i>

19:56.228 --> 19:57.461
(sighs)

19:57.463 --> 19:59.163
Oh, god, mur.

19:59.165 --> 20:00.731
Butting out is so hard.

20:00.733 --> 20:03.301
Yeah, but look at him.
He's having so much fun.

20:03.303 --> 20:05.069
Doesn't that
make you happy?

20:05.071 --> 20:07.205
<i> ¶ I never really cared</i>
<i> until I met you</i>

20:07.207 --> 20:09.440
Damn it, it does.
(chuckles)

20:09.442 --> 20:10.942
That's good for me.

20:10.944 --> 20:13.311
Happy wife, happy life.

20:13.313 --> 20:16.981
<i> ¶ how do I get you alone? ¶</i>

20:17.649 --> 20:20.851
Adult adam:
<i> That's the thing about</i>
<i> being a parent...</i>

20:21.486 --> 20:22.119
<i> It's tough,</i>

20:22.121 --> 20:25.256
<i> And it doesn't come with</i>
<i> a spinner and instructions.</i>

20:25.258 --> 20:26.958
<i> You learn as you go.</i>

20:26.960 --> 20:30.161
<i> But seeing the smile</i>
<i> on my face that night</i>

20:30.163 --> 20:32.263
<i> Gave my mom a new saying...</i>

20:32.265 --> 20:35.566
<i> "happy kids, happy life."</i>

20:35.568 --> 20:38.135
<i> (alone</i> fades)

20:42.074 --> 20:44.542
Ahh. Back for more?

20:44.544 --> 20:47.111
I came to return
this shoddy knock-off.

20:47.113 --> 20:49.547
You bought a bootleg toy
out of a trunk.

20:49.549 --> 20:51.249
All sales are final.

20:51.251 --> 20:53.451
Well, at least
let me trade it
for this.

20:53.453 --> 20:59.390
<i> ¶ till now,</i>
<i> I always got</i>
<i> by on my own</i>

20:59.825 --> 21:02.893
<i> ¶ I never really cared</i>
<i> until I met you ¶</i>

21:02.895 --> 21:06.631
Wow, it's crazy
how two people
can reach into a trunk

21:06.633 --> 21:10.301
And their fingers
just...Kind of meet,
you know?

21:10.303 --> 21:12.436
(music stops)
I'm gonna take
this as a lesson

21:12.438 --> 21:15.506
Never to buy toys
from a man's trunk

21:15.508 --> 21:16.874
Behind a warehouse.

21:16.876 --> 21:17.308
(thud)

21:17.310 --> 21:21.412
I also sell a lifetime
of devotion and
tenderness.

21:26.118 --> 21:27.551
(dinging)
