WEBVTT

00:39.822 --> 00:41.084
MAN :
Aloha, it's Luka.

00:41.128 --> 00:41.954
You know what to do.

00:49.223 --> 00:51.660
Don't worry, he'll show.

00:51.703 --> 00:54.358
You guys are on next.

00:54.402 --> 00:56.056
Our drummer's running late.

00:56.099 --> 00:57.883
Any chance we can get
a little delay?

00:57.927 --> 01:00.973
I can buy you a couple
of minutes, that's it.

01:01.017 --> 01:02.105
You're on in five,

01:02.149 --> 01:03.628
or you're not on at all.
Fire dancers!

01:03.672 --> 01:05.152
Come with me.

01:20.210 --> 01:21.951
Hey, man.

01:21.994 --> 01:24.867
Luka, where you at?
I been calling you.

01:24.910 --> 01:26.999
I'm sorry, Flip.
I messed up, I know.

01:27.043 --> 01:29.915
I just had to take care
of something important.

01:29.959 --> 01:31.308
What's more important than
the set we gotta play

01:31.352 --> 01:33.789
in five minutes?I said I'm sorry.

01:33.832 --> 01:35.269
Look, I'm about
to unload the kit.

01:35.312 --> 01:36.705
I'll be right there.

01:36.748 --> 01:38.272
Okay, I'll see if I can
hold off the stage manager.

01:38.315 --> 01:39.403
Yo, she's like a straight-up
viper out here.

01:39.447 --> 01:42.406
Luka?

01:42.450 --> 01:44.452
Yo, Luka.

01:44.495 --> 01:46.758
FLIPPA :
You still there?

01:46.802 --> 01:49.065
Luka?

01:49.109 --> 01:50.371
You still there?

02:30.541 --> 02:32.891
Duke.
Commander.

02:32.935 --> 02:34.502
What are we looking at?

02:34.545 --> 02:36.330
Victim's van and wallet
were stolen.

02:36.373 --> 02:38.288
No security cameras
or witnesses.

02:38.332 --> 02:39.942
But we got a BOLO out
on the vehicle.

02:39.985 --> 02:41.857
Maybe we'll get lucky.How's he doing?

02:41.900 --> 02:44.381
We managed to get
a statement from him,

02:44.425 --> 02:46.078
but I think he's still in shock.

02:46.122 --> 02:48.777
All right, give me a minute.

02:56.001 --> 02:58.047
Could you give us
a minute, please?

02:58.090 --> 03:00.876
We're gonna do
everything we can

03:00.919 --> 03:02.225
to find out who did this,
you understand?

03:02.269 --> 03:05.097
All I heard was a thud,

03:05.141 --> 03:06.534
and a crack when his
phone hit the deck.

03:06.577 --> 03:08.971
I thought he'd flaked
on the gig,

03:09.014 --> 03:10.364
so I was annoyed.

03:10.407 --> 03:12.061
That was the last time
I ever talked to him.

03:12.104 --> 03:13.628
Hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

03:13.671 --> 03:15.151
Don't do that.

03:15.195 --> 03:16.935
Don't beat yourself up.
Not now, okay?

03:16.979 --> 03:18.154
You got it?

03:18.198 --> 03:20.200
Steve, something ain't
right about this.

03:20.243 --> 03:24.029
Killed over his wheels
and an old drum kit? No.

03:24.073 --> 03:26.206
Luka would have handed over
the keys like that.

03:27.642 --> 03:30.471
Dude loved life too much to
risk it all over some stuff.

03:31.472 --> 03:33.082
All right, listen to me,

03:33.125 --> 03:35.084
I promise you,
as soon as I know something,

03:35.127 --> 03:36.433
you're my first call.

03:36.477 --> 03:37.478
All right? In the meantime,

03:37.521 --> 03:39.088
I need you to do something
for me.

03:39.131 --> 03:40.350
I need you to hang in there.

03:40.394 --> 03:42.265
Okay.
All right.

03:42.309 --> 03:44.224
Thanks, Steve.
I got you.

03:49.011 --> 03:51.622
Noelani, what do we got?

03:51.666 --> 03:53.972
Commander, we have
nine stab wounds.

03:54.016 --> 03:56.497
Jagged patterns
at points of entry.
Nine?

03:56.540 --> 03:58.673
Mm-hmm.
That's a little
excessive, no?

03:58.716 --> 04:01.328
Yeah. As is the wound
on the carotid artery.

04:01.371 --> 04:04.069
Seems our carjacker was
determined to not leave

04:04.113 --> 04:05.941
any witnesses behind.

04:05.984 --> 04:07.247
It's possible this guy
stole the van and the wallet

04:07.290 --> 04:08.726
to make it look like
a carjacking.

04:08.770 --> 04:10.206
I'm just saying
this looks, uh--

04:10.250 --> 04:12.904
this looks like
something personal.

04:12.948 --> 04:13.818
What else we got?

04:13.862 --> 04:15.037
Just this.

04:18.649 --> 04:21.043
A long, blonde hair?
Mm-hmm.

04:21.086 --> 04:22.262
I found it on
the victim's shirt.

04:22.305 --> 04:24.220
Could be completely
unrelated to our murder.

04:24.264 --> 04:27.223
Yeah, or it could belong
to our killer.

04:31.401 --> 04:35.144
All right, so our vic,
Luka Palakiko.

04:35.187 --> 04:37.277
The lab ran that foreign hair
found on his body.

04:37.320 --> 04:39.540
No matches in the system,
but listen to this.

04:39.583 --> 04:41.498
We did a deep dive on Luka.

04:41.542 --> 04:43.979
So, when he wasn't
playing gigs with Flippa,

04:44.022 --> 04:46.764
he worked as a family therapist
at a clinic in Kailua.

04:46.808 --> 04:49.114
No criminal record,
but check this out.

04:49.158 --> 04:50.725
In the last three months,

04:50.768 --> 04:53.728
he paid over five grand
to a Venmo account,

04:53.771 --> 04:56.339
and the owner's name
is Annie Kehr.

04:56.383 --> 04:58.428
Who's Annie Kehr?

04:58.472 --> 05:00.561
She's a 15-year-old
high school sophomore.

05:02.214 --> 05:03.738
With long, blonde hair.Mm-hmm.

05:03.781 --> 05:07.219
This bird is making payments
to an underage girl

05:07.263 --> 05:09.396
whose hair was found on his body
the night he was killed.

05:09.439 --> 05:11.311
Screams "inappropriate
relationship."

05:11.354 --> 05:14.052
It's the kind of relationship
that sets you right up

05:14.096 --> 05:15.750
for blackmail,
not to mention murder.

05:15.793 --> 05:18.361
Maybe Flippa didn't know his boy
as well as he thought he did.

05:25.368 --> 05:26.456
Hey.
STEVE:
Hey.

05:26.500 --> 05:27.631
I just spoke to
Annie Kehr's parents.

05:27.675 --> 05:28.937
They haven't seen her
since yesterday.

05:28.980 --> 05:30.068
She was supposed to be
at a friend's house

05:30.112 --> 05:31.635
studying for a test.Was she not there?

05:31.679 --> 05:33.376
Not unless the friend
lives on Maui.

05:33.420 --> 05:35.465
The flight record showed
that she took off yesterday.

05:35.509 --> 05:38.642
In fact, the flight left
HNL Airport one hour after

05:38.686 --> 05:40.296
Luka Palakiko was stabbed
to death.

05:40.340 --> 05:42.820
Okay, well, if she pre-checked,
that would give her enough time

05:42.864 --> 05:44.779
to get from the crime scene
to the airport, no?

05:44.822 --> 05:46.607
Well, it certainly looks
like she skipped town.

05:46.650 --> 05:49.261
Maui PD's looking
for her as we speak.

05:49.305 --> 05:50.567
Let me ask you a question.

05:50.611 --> 05:53.831
Do you really buy that
this 15-year-old girl

05:53.875 --> 05:55.224
stuck nine holes
into a fully grown man,

05:55.267 --> 05:56.573
one right through his neck?

05:56.617 --> 05:58.053
Well, maybe she had help.

05:58.096 --> 06:00.229
Maybe someone found out
about the relationship

06:00.272 --> 06:03.363
and strongly disapproved;
I know that I do.

06:03.406 --> 06:06.540
Tani Rey.

06:07.845 --> 06:10.935
Okay, thanks for
the information.

06:10.979 --> 06:12.415
We're gonna talk
to Annie ourselves.

06:12.459 --> 06:15.026
Maui PD just picked her up
at a bus stop.

06:15.070 --> 06:17.507
They're escorting her back
to Oahu as we speak.

06:21.816 --> 06:23.208
Hi, Annie.

06:23.252 --> 06:25.776
Uh, my name's Steve McGarrett.

06:25.820 --> 06:28.475
I'm guessing you already met
my colleague here, Tani Rey.

06:28.518 --> 06:31.391
Jill Yamada.
I'm Annie's lawyer.

06:31.434 --> 06:33.958
STEVE: Well,
you must know

06:34.002 --> 06:36.700
that, as a minor, Annie
is under no obligation

06:36.744 --> 06:40.182
to, uh, to speak to us without
her parents present, okay?

06:40.225 --> 06:43.751
You think I want
to talk to them?

06:43.794 --> 06:45.056
After what they did?

06:45.100 --> 06:46.493
JILL:
With all due respect, Commander,

06:46.536 --> 06:48.712
this seems like overkill.

06:48.756 --> 06:51.541
Why is Five-O involved
in a juvenile runaway case?

06:51.585 --> 06:53.630
Ms. Yamada, this is
a murder investigation.

06:53.674 --> 06:56.241
One in which your client
is a person of interest.

06:56.285 --> 06:57.591
What are you talking about?

06:57.634 --> 07:00.332
Luka Palakiko was
murdered last night.

07:00.376 --> 07:03.161
One of your client's hairs
was found on the body.

07:03.205 --> 07:07.862
Uh, Luk-Luka is--
Luka is dead?

07:09.124 --> 07:12.954
No, no, no. No.

07:12.997 --> 07:15.304
When's the last time
you saw Luka, Annie?Last night.

07:15.347 --> 07:19.047
Um, he drove me to the airport
before his gig.

07:19.090 --> 07:20.657
I had--

07:20.701 --> 07:23.443
Annie, I'm really sorry
to have to ask this,

07:23.486 --> 07:26.837
but were you and Luka
in a relationship?

07:26.881 --> 07:30.014
What? No.
Luka-Luka was gay.

07:31.668 --> 07:32.756
Okay.

07:32.800 --> 07:35.977
Well, why was he
sending you money?

07:36.020 --> 07:38.458
Because he was trying
to save my life.Luka was Annie's therapist.

07:38.501 --> 07:41.504
He counseled LGBTQ youth.

07:41.548 --> 07:44.638
Like me. I saw him
every Tuesday.

07:46.117 --> 07:49.251
My parents thought
I was at debate club.

07:49.294 --> 07:52.254
When they found out
I was gay, they...

07:52.297 --> 07:54.343
flipped out.

07:54.386 --> 07:57.085
Arranged to send me
to conversion therapy.

07:58.478 --> 08:00.305
You say conversion therapy?

08:00.349 --> 08:02.786
The state of Hawaii
banned that last year, no?

08:02.830 --> 08:04.440
For good reason.
JILL:
Yes, and that's why

08:04.484 --> 08:06.355
Annie's parents want to
send her to a school in Idaho,

08:06.398 --> 08:07.617
where it's still legal.

08:07.661 --> 08:10.664
Luka didn't want to see that
happen to me.

08:10.707 --> 08:14.494
That's why he arranged
to send me to a sanctuary home

08:14.537 --> 08:16.626
for LGBTQ youth in Maui.

08:16.670 --> 08:18.672
He was also paying
my legal fees.

08:18.715 --> 08:19.803
We're working to
get Annie emancipated

08:19.847 --> 08:21.109
so she can make
her own decisions.

08:21.152 --> 08:23.198
The judge rejected
our first petition,

08:23.241 --> 08:24.329
so her only chance now is

08:24.373 --> 08:26.462
getting both parents'
signatures.

08:26.506 --> 08:28.986
Boss.
Yo.

08:29.030 --> 08:31.119
Hold it right here, please.

08:31.162 --> 08:32.207
TANI:
Speak of the devil.

08:32.250 --> 08:34.688
We have a problem.

08:34.731 --> 08:35.906
They're her legal guardians,
they have the right

08:35.950 --> 08:37.865
to end this conversation
and take her away.

08:37.908 --> 08:39.954
Please, don't make me
go home with them.

08:39.997 --> 08:42.913
They're gonna send me
on a plane to that...

08:42.957 --> 08:44.132
to that place.

08:44.175 --> 08:46.526
Annie, you're not
going anywhere.

08:47.918 --> 08:50.834
Okay, I'll be right back.

08:53.837 --> 08:56.927
Everything okay?

08:56.971 --> 08:59.756
Mr. and Mrs. Kehr,
Steve McGarrett.

08:59.800 --> 09:02.106
Maybe we could go talk someplace
a little more private?

09:02.150 --> 09:03.804
If that's okay.
Just through here.

09:03.847 --> 09:05.545
Thank you.

09:06.937 --> 09:08.243
WOMAN:
This is crazy.

09:08.286 --> 09:09.984
You have no right to keep us
from our daughter.

09:10.027 --> 09:12.290
You drag us in here, tell us
she was picked up in Maui

09:12.334 --> 09:13.553
in connection with a crime?

09:13.596 --> 09:15.250
Yeah, she was involved
with a crime.

09:15.293 --> 09:16.991
A murder, as a matter of fact.

09:17.034 --> 09:18.906
STEVE: Do either of you two
know a man

09:18.949 --> 09:21.343
named Luka Palakiko?

09:21.386 --> 09:22.866
No. Why?

09:22.910 --> 09:24.564
Well, you should.

09:24.607 --> 09:26.740
Your daughter was
seeing him once a week.

09:26.783 --> 09:29.351
He's a counselor
for LGBTQ youth.

09:29.394 --> 09:30.657
Well, he-he was.

09:30.700 --> 09:33.137
Not ringing any bells, huh?

09:36.663 --> 09:37.838
Thank you.

09:37.881 --> 09:38.969
This is pretty
interesting.

09:39.013 --> 09:40.405
I do have
another question.

09:40.449 --> 09:42.059
Why'd you just lie to me?

09:42.103 --> 09:44.453
I just asked you
if you knew Luka, you said no.

09:44.496 --> 09:48.065
But here it says that you hired
a private investigator

09:48.109 --> 09:49.501
to look into him.
Buddy...

09:51.329 --> 09:53.288
...unless you two have
a rock-solid alibi,

09:53.331 --> 09:55.072
you've got some
'splaining to do.

09:55.116 --> 09:59.076
Please, we're just trying to do
what's best for her.

09:59.120 --> 10:02.602
We love our daughter very much.
We just hate the sin.

10:02.645 --> 10:04.168
There's nothing sinful
about the little girl

10:04.212 --> 10:06.040
sitting in my office right now.

10:06.083 --> 10:09.086
It's a good thing she knows
that about herself, too.

10:09.130 --> 10:11.045
Can I ask you a question?

10:11.088 --> 10:12.220
I can't wrap

10:12.263 --> 10:14.091
my head around this.

10:14.135 --> 10:16.093
I have two children myself.

10:16.137 --> 10:18.226
What kind of parents

10:18.269 --> 10:21.969
would send their child off
to someplace to be tortured...

10:22.012 --> 10:24.754
It's not torture, it's healing.

10:24.798 --> 10:28.236
Whether you understand this or
not, this is spiritual warfare,

10:28.279 --> 10:30.673
and we are battling
for the soul of our little girl.

10:30.717 --> 10:32.240
All she needs is guidance

10:32.283 --> 10:33.937
onto a better path
to make the right choice.

10:33.981 --> 10:35.330
Choice?

10:35.373 --> 10:36.592
Do your children make decisions

10:36.636 --> 10:37.985
about their education,
or do you?

10:38.028 --> 10:39.900
NED: It's not Annie's fault
she entered life

10:39.943 --> 10:43.294
with her wires crossed.

10:43.338 --> 10:45.340
It's a problem with a solution.

10:45.383 --> 10:47.647
Mr. Kehr, I don't know how to
break this to you, but Annie's

10:47.690 --> 10:49.344
not the one
with the wires crossed.

10:49.387 --> 10:50.693
Do you have children?

10:50.737 --> 10:51.912
No, I don't.

10:51.955 --> 10:53.914
But when I do,

10:53.957 --> 10:56.438
I intend to love them
unconditionally,

10:56.481 --> 10:59.180
for who they are.

10:59.223 --> 11:01.791
Excuse me.

11:01.835 --> 11:05.142
We're not done here,
so, uh, please get comfortable.

11:05.186 --> 11:07.362
I'll be back.

11:09.190 --> 11:10.757
Okay. What do we got?

11:10.800 --> 11:12.541
Traffic cam caught Luka's van
at the intersection

11:12.584 --> 11:15.849
of Kealanani and Farrington
20 minutes after TOD.

11:15.892 --> 11:17.677
I got a clear shot of the
driver through the windshield,

11:17.720 --> 11:19.983
ran it through facial rec,
and somebody popped.

11:20.027 --> 11:22.551
Meet Connor Russell, 23-year-old
ex-con, and the driver

11:22.594 --> 11:24.771
of Luka's stolen van.Which makes him
look good for murder.

11:24.814 --> 11:26.816
What was Russell in for?

11:26.860 --> 11:28.818
He did three years of a
five-year bid in Halawa

11:28.862 --> 11:31.212
for felony assault in the first.
Got out four months ago.

11:31.255 --> 11:33.562
And that's just the kicker
on a rap sheet full of arrests

11:33.605 --> 11:34.737
since he turned 18.

11:34.781 --> 11:36.565
Plus, he has a sealed
juvenile record.

11:36.608 --> 11:37.958
Who knows
what's on that.

11:38.001 --> 11:40.351
So maybe this was a carjacking
and nothing more.

11:40.395 --> 11:42.658
Or maybe the Kehrs hired
Russell to kill Luka,

11:42.702 --> 11:45.182
in which case, we're gonna
find a connection somewhere.

11:45.226 --> 11:47.141
Makes sense. I mean,
when their PI didn't turn up

11:47.184 --> 11:49.012
anything actionable,
the Kehrs enlist

11:49.056 --> 11:51.145
this ex-con Russell to
make their problem go away.

11:51.188 --> 11:52.233
Okay.

11:52.276 --> 11:54.017
For now,
we keep the parents on ice.

11:54.061 --> 11:55.932
Okay? Presuming
they come up clean,

11:55.976 --> 11:57.194
they do not leave this building

11:57.238 --> 11:59.501
until they sign
Annie's emancipation papers.

11:59.544 --> 12:01.503
All right? In the meantime,
Junior, grab Jerry,

12:01.546 --> 12:03.244
go check out this guy's
last known address.

12:03.287 --> 12:05.725
With pleasure.

12:11.905 --> 12:13.820
Hey, hey, it's okay. It's okay.

12:13.863 --> 12:15.038
It's okay.
Where is Connor?

12:15.082 --> 12:16.692
It's okay.

12:18.738 --> 12:20.217
Shh.

12:23.743 --> 12:25.701
Okay, so I spoke
to the roommate.

12:25.745 --> 12:26.963
She said she hasn't seen
Russell in a few days,

12:27.007 --> 12:29.836
does not know where he is.
They never speak.

12:29.879 --> 12:32.055
And he spends all his
time alone in his room.

12:33.317 --> 12:35.319
You mean his locked room.

12:37.017 --> 12:38.061
I'll go get the ram.

12:38.105 --> 12:39.236
Hang on.

12:39.280 --> 12:41.064
Coming through!

12:41.108 --> 12:43.327
Or you could do that.

12:48.158 --> 12:49.725
Clear.

12:49.769 --> 12:51.161
Not what I was expecting.

12:53.337 --> 12:55.383
Some ex-con living in a
normal house with a roommate.

12:55.426 --> 12:58.255
Yeah, I get what you mean.

13:01.432 --> 13:03.870
Like, take the encryption here.

13:03.913 --> 13:06.394
This guy's got his computer
locked up pretty tight.

13:06.437 --> 13:09.266
That means he must have
something worth hiding on it.

13:09.310 --> 13:11.225
Damn it.

13:11.268 --> 13:13.009
Let's hope I can
crack this puppy here.

13:13.053 --> 13:14.881
I'm gonna have to take it
back to HQ.

13:14.924 --> 13:15.838
All right, I'll call up CSU.

13:15.882 --> 13:17.666
No, no. I got it.

13:17.709 --> 13:19.624
Hey, Jerry, slow down.
What's your rush?

13:32.072 --> 13:34.378
There were three charges
set on that computer,

13:34.422 --> 13:35.553
only one of them went off.

13:35.597 --> 13:36.816
STEVE:
Sounds like you got lucky

13:36.859 --> 13:38.121
there, Jerry.

13:38.165 --> 13:40.254
Yeah, I'm not feeling
so lucky, but thanks.

13:40.297 --> 13:41.559
Guy hooks up a bomb
to his computer?

13:41.603 --> 13:43.518
Now, there's somebody
who doesn't want anybody

13:43.561 --> 13:45.128
finding out what's on it.Yeah.

13:45.172 --> 13:48.218
I mean, I don't want anyone
finding out what's on mine.

13:48.262 --> 13:50.046
What's that?

13:50.090 --> 13:51.047
I mean not that there's
anything weird on it,

13:51.091 --> 13:52.875
it's just, you know, my stuff.

13:52.919 --> 13:55.051
But I just use your standard
80-bit password.

13:55.095 --> 13:58.272
I agree.
A bomb's kind of extreme.

13:58.315 --> 13:59.534
STEVE:
So we got an ex-con

13:59.577 --> 14:01.014
who locks himself away
in his room all day

14:01.057 --> 14:02.232
doing God knows what
on his computer.

14:02.276 --> 14:03.364
JUNIOR:
And we know

14:03.407 --> 14:05.540
he has skills with explosives.

14:05.583 --> 14:06.846
Sounds like
a combustible situation.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.196
No pun, I swear.

14:09.239 --> 14:10.893
Guys, is that McGarrett
on the line?

14:10.937 --> 14:13.200
Yes.
Good, he needs to hear
this-- Steve. It's Adam.

14:13.243 --> 14:15.245
Bomb squad just did
a sweep of the place.Hey.

14:15.289 --> 14:17.682
Said t-the charges on the
computer were gunpowder-based,

14:17.726 --> 14:20.598
but they also found trace
elements of ammonium nitrate

14:20.642 --> 14:22.644
on four of his shirts and two
pairs of shoes in his closet.

14:22.687 --> 14:24.037
STEVE:
Ammonium nitrate

14:24.080 --> 14:26.387
is the key ingredient
for a fertilizer bomb.

14:26.430 --> 14:28.258
Which is usually staged
in a large vehicle,

14:28.302 --> 14:29.564
like a panel truck.

14:29.607 --> 14:30.565
or a van.

14:30.608 --> 14:31.653
JUNIOR:
Okay, wait a minute.

14:31.696 --> 14:32.915
I get that Russell needs a van

14:32.959 --> 14:34.134
to get this bomb to the target,

14:34.177 --> 14:35.744
but why take
a massive risk

14:35.787 --> 14:38.138
killing someone in a public
place? Why not just rent one?

14:38.181 --> 14:39.835
Because he wants
to get away with it.

14:39.879 --> 14:41.097
You rent a vehicle,
even under

14:41.141 --> 14:42.272
a fake name, leaves a trail.

14:42.316 --> 14:43.883
That's how they caught
Timothy McVeigh.

14:45.058 --> 14:46.233
Yeah, and now we got
our own McVeigh

14:46.276 --> 14:48.017
right here on the island.

14:55.329 --> 14:57.548
All right, you're planning
a mass casualty attack,

14:57.592 --> 14:59.681
it's gonna take a lot
of things, it's gonna
take a lot of research,

14:59.724 --> 15:01.596
it's gonna take
a lot of planning.

15:01.639 --> 15:03.728
I think that's probably
what this guy was looking into

15:03.772 --> 15:05.295
on his computer.

15:05.339 --> 15:06.731
Yeah, well, take it from me,
CSU's gonna find nada

15:06.775 --> 15:08.777
on that machine. It's shot.

15:08.820 --> 15:10.997
But maybe I can access
the data another way.

15:11.040 --> 15:12.128
Uh, let me
head back to HQ,

15:12.172 --> 15:14.217
dig around, see what I can find.

15:14.261 --> 15:15.436
Jerry, you got
second degree burns.

15:15.479 --> 15:17.133
You don't have to be a hero.No, I'm good.

15:17.177 --> 15:18.569
I mean, I'm even more fired up
to catch this guy.

15:18.613 --> 15:20.920
Let's do this.

15:22.182 --> 15:24.140
Uh, which reminds me,

15:24.184 --> 15:25.446
I'm gonna need a pair
of working hands.

15:25.489 --> 15:26.534
Junior, can you be my wingman?

15:26.577 --> 15:29.015
Yeah, man. Let's go.

15:29.058 --> 15:30.407
STEVE:
All right, good call, you two.

15:30.451 --> 15:32.322
Tani, Adam, listen to me.
I need you to contact

15:32.366 --> 15:35.195
the HPD and HDOT
right away, all right?

15:35.238 --> 15:37.197
Tell them there is--
there is a mobile bomb

15:37.240 --> 15:38.981
that could detonate
anywhere at any time.

15:39.025 --> 15:40.461
They need to pull over

15:40.504 --> 15:42.115
every van that matches
the make and model of this one,

15:42.158 --> 15:44.160
doesn't matter if i-it's
a different color.

15:44.204 --> 15:45.553
Russell knows we're onto him,

15:45.596 --> 15:47.120
and it's highly likely
he slapped a coat of paint

15:47.163 --> 15:48.208
on it already.

15:48.251 --> 15:49.818
You got it.STEVE: Oh, also,

15:49.861 --> 15:50.862
no checkpoints, all right?

15:50.906 --> 15:51.863
I don't want this guy

15:51.907 --> 15:53.039
triggering an early blast

15:53.082 --> 15:54.214
'cause he thinks
the net's dropping.

15:54.257 --> 15:55.171
TANI:
Understood.

15:55.215 --> 15:57.043
Hey, boss, listen,

15:57.086 --> 15:58.479
Russell got out of prison
four months ago.

15:58.522 --> 16:00.046
I'm thinking there's
a good chance that he came up

16:00.089 --> 16:01.743
with his plan before that.

16:04.180 --> 16:05.660
BARTON:
The Connor Russell I knew

16:05.703 --> 16:10.056
was a nervous, angry kid,

16:10.099 --> 16:13.059
but I never took him
to be a killer.

16:13.102 --> 16:15.409
Why'd they bunk him with one?

16:15.452 --> 16:17.411
A young guy like that
would get eaten alive

16:17.454 --> 16:19.326
in a place like this.

16:19.369 --> 16:21.893
Believe it or not,
I was the safest choice.

16:21.937 --> 16:23.460
GROVER:  A guy
who murdered his wife

16:23.504 --> 16:26.637
and a U.S. Marshal.
Safest choice, you?

16:26.681 --> 16:28.030
I've changed my life around.

16:28.074 --> 16:30.554
My work here, in the ministry,
in the library

16:30.598 --> 16:33.340
is all aimed
at helping others do the same.

16:33.383 --> 16:35.646
Everybody can change.

16:35.690 --> 16:39.172
Even someone as
lost as... as Connor.

16:39.215 --> 16:41.174
GROVER: Uh,
no argument there,

16:41.217 --> 16:43.524
but, uh, the problem is,
Connor changed for the worse.

16:43.567 --> 16:45.917
Who'd he talk
to in here?

16:45.961 --> 16:47.441
Who did he associate with?

16:47.484 --> 16:50.009
He was shy, he wasn't
really built for prison,

16:50.052 --> 16:52.794
or any other kind
of social life, for that matter.

16:52.837 --> 16:54.926
He was scarred by relentless
bullying in high school,

16:54.970 --> 17:00.019
so days, he spent by himself,
and at night, in the cell,

17:00.062 --> 17:01.324
he only talked
to me because,

17:01.368 --> 17:02.760
well, I was there.

17:02.804 --> 17:04.762
And even then,
he didn't say much.

17:04.806 --> 17:09.376
Here's the thing, this murder
of Luka Palakiko, we're thinking

17:09.419 --> 17:11.073
it's the beginning
of something.

17:11.117 --> 17:14.076
We have reason to believe that
Connor is planning some kind of

17:14.120 --> 17:16.426
mass-casualty event.No.

17:16.470 --> 17:18.428
That's not the Connor I know.Well,

17:18.472 --> 17:20.604
there's a strong possibility
that you didn't know this Connor

17:20.648 --> 17:22.432
as well as you think you did.

17:24.695 --> 17:26.393
Listen, admittedly,

17:26.436 --> 17:27.829
this is a long shot,

17:27.872 --> 17:29.700
but it could be
a psychotic break.

17:29.744 --> 17:32.921
Connor is, uh,
in his early 20s,

17:32.964 --> 17:36.316
when heritable disorders
typically have

17:36.359 --> 17:37.491
an increased
opportunity

17:37.534 --> 17:39.319
to present.

17:39.362 --> 17:41.843
How in the hell
would you know all of that?

17:41.886 --> 17:43.584
I'm in prison. All I do is read.

17:43.627 --> 17:45.281
Hold on.

17:45.325 --> 17:49.807
How are you-how are attaching
a heritable disorder to Connor?

17:49.851 --> 17:54.856
Well, Connor's father was
a paranoid schizophrenic.

17:57.467 --> 17:58.512
Oh, you didn't know that.

17:58.555 --> 18:00.775
No.Russell, Sr.

18:00.818 --> 18:04.344
went off his meds and killed
himself when Connor was 13.

18:04.387 --> 18:05.562
And perhaps

18:05.606 --> 18:06.911
a different demon
from the same hell

18:06.955 --> 18:09.523
has come to reclaim the son.

18:09.566 --> 18:10.959
Listen to me,

18:11.002 --> 18:14.223
I read Connor Russell's
medical report, all right?

18:14.267 --> 18:15.529
There was nothing
in that history

18:15.572 --> 18:17.357
that would indicate any of that.

18:21.012 --> 18:22.362
Incomplete
medical records

18:22.405 --> 18:24.277
in a state prison?

18:25.843 --> 18:27.802
Color me shocked.

18:27.845 --> 18:30.196
All right, thanks for your help.

18:30.239 --> 18:31.588
If you think of anything else,

18:31.632 --> 18:33.590
feel free to reach out,
all right?

18:35.375 --> 18:40.119
So, Connor was a loner, bullied
relentlessly in high school,

18:40.162 --> 18:42.295
now he's a bomb maker
who's possibly mentally ill.

18:42.338 --> 18:44.471
All right, we got to find
which high school he went to.

18:44.514 --> 18:46.560
Do me a favor, call HPD,
have them put a detail on it.

18:46.603 --> 18:47.778
Yeah, Jerry, what do you got?

18:47.822 --> 18:50.781
JERRY:
Got something you need to see.

18:50.825 --> 18:53.828
Using the ISP from Russell's
building's Internet provider,

18:53.871 --> 18:55.438
we located a private,
password-protected site

18:55.482 --> 18:56.396
on the dark Web.

18:56.439 --> 18:57.484
Take a look.

18:57.527 --> 18:59.834
White power!

18:59.877 --> 19:01.575
White power!Blood and soil!

19:01.618 --> 19:03.490
Blood and soil!GROVER:
We got racism,

19:03.533 --> 19:07.363
sexism and anti-Semitism.

19:07.407 --> 19:09.235
It's like the hate trifecta.

19:09.278 --> 19:10.584
JERRY: Yeah,
what it is

19:10.627 --> 19:13.152
is alt-right crap.
Online Klansmen, neo-Nazis.

19:13.195 --> 19:15.284
Yeah, it gets worse.
Check out this video.

19:15.328 --> 19:17.460
: Every proud member
of United Aryan Division

19:17.504 --> 19:19.114
has been red-pilled.

19:19.158 --> 19:22.204
Join us, do the same,

19:22.248 --> 19:24.859
and the truth will
be revealed to you.Russell.

19:24.902 --> 19:26.469
The truth behind
our country's...

19:26.513 --> 19:28.863
Okay, I mean, I'm starting
to think the murder of Luka

19:28.906 --> 19:30.473
was a twofer, right?

19:30.517 --> 19:32.475
Uh, Russell gets his van...JERRY: And he
gets to exercise

19:32.519 --> 19:34.521
his racial hatred by killing
a person of color.

19:34.564 --> 19:37.350
We frontline soldiers,
we are the tip of the spear,

19:37.393 --> 19:41.963
The blood of the impure
will run in the streets.

19:42.006 --> 19:46.402
Blood from sea to shining sea.

19:46.446 --> 19:49.449
All right, so maybe
I'm just being naive,

19:49.492 --> 19:53.104
but I figured that Hawaii
would be the last place on Earth

19:53.148 --> 19:54.976
that you'd find a neo-Nazi.

19:55.019 --> 19:57.021
Well, thanks to the Internet,
they're everywhere now.

19:57.065 --> 19:58.240
STEVE:
Yeah.

19:58.284 --> 20:00.590
And ours is building a bomb.

20:24.048 --> 20:25.746
Can I help you, Officer?

20:25.789 --> 20:27.269
Workers said they may have
spotted a vehicle of interest

20:27.313 --> 20:28.705
pulling into this business park.

20:28.749 --> 20:32.318
It's a, uh,
2005 Chevrolet van, white.

20:32.361 --> 20:34.755
Haven't seen it, sorry.

20:34.798 --> 20:37.627
Well, you mind
if I take a quick look around?

20:50.336 --> 20:52.468
You made all this, huh?

20:53.991 --> 20:55.993
Modern art's more
of my wife's kind thing.

20:57.865 --> 20:59.301
Hmm.

20:59.345 --> 21:02.173
You have yourself a nice day.

21:02.217 --> 21:04.132
You too, sir.

21:18.364 --> 21:20.322
Adam,

21:20.366 --> 21:22.324
Tani, what do you got?We've pulled over 11 vans

21:22.368 --> 21:24.587
and we're looking into leads
off a half a dozen tips,

21:24.631 --> 21:25.936
but so far nothing.Boss,

21:25.980 --> 21:27.677
I got to tell you,
we're up against it here.

21:27.721 --> 21:29.636
We cast the net
as far as we could,

21:29.679 --> 21:31.115
but HPD is stretched
to capacity.

21:31.159 --> 21:32.987
Plus, we've got a finite number
of eyes in the sky;

21:33.030 --> 21:34.467
we're not gonna spot
every van on the road.

21:34.510 --> 21:35.990
Call NSA, all right?

21:36.033 --> 21:37.383
Have them redirect
a keyhole satellite.

21:37.426 --> 21:39.254
Every second on this one counts.

21:39.298 --> 21:41.691
We got to find this guy
before he detonates that bomb.

21:41.735 --> 21:43.171
Jerry.

21:43.214 --> 21:45.216
Please tell me
you got something.I think so.

21:45.260 --> 21:47.349
I've watched this,
like, a dozen times now.

21:47.393 --> 21:48.959
And I think I'm finally
on to something.

21:49.003 --> 21:50.309
Look at the language
he's using.

21:50.352 --> 21:51.832
Five syllable words,
long sentences.

21:51.875 --> 21:54.269
This from a guy who never
even graduated high school.

21:54.313 --> 21:56.271
There's no way he could have
written this on his own.

21:56.315 --> 21:57.490
Okay, so what?
You think--

21:57.533 --> 21:59.274
he, maybe he's got
a co-conspirator and if we

21:59.318 --> 22:01.494
find out who that is
then that might help us

22:01.537 --> 22:03.583
identify the target.Exactly.
Now check this out.

22:03.626 --> 22:06.150
This is a new
toy I picked up

22:06.194 --> 22:08.065
from some new
friends at Quantico.

22:08.109 --> 22:10.285
It is a high-speed
text analysis algorithm

22:10.329 --> 22:12.200
designed to look
for similarities

22:12.243 --> 22:13.288
in language patterns.

22:13.332 --> 22:15.072
See, everyone's got
their unique way

22:15.116 --> 22:17.988
of speaking and writing
and what this program does

22:18.032 --> 22:21.078
is it studies those patterns
and can often attribute them

22:21.122 --> 22:22.558
to a specific writer.

22:22.602 --> 22:26.170
So, we inputted the audio
from all the hate videos,

22:26.214 --> 22:28.608
the transcripts of which are
currently being cross-referenced

22:28.651 --> 22:30.436
with the whole Web
and the dark Web,

22:30.479 --> 22:33.395
looking for phrasal
and/or keyword matches.

22:36.616 --> 22:38.226
Is that a good sound?

22:38.269 --> 22:40.184
That is a great sound;
it means we got a hit.

22:42.448 --> 22:43.971
Okay, see? There are
two turns of phrases

22:44.014 --> 22:45.799
that repeat often
in the videos.

22:45.842 --> 22:49.106
"Tip of the spear" and
"from sea to shining sea."

22:49.150 --> 22:52.893
Now, these same phrases
appear intact

22:52.936 --> 22:55.461
in op-eds published in
a Scottsdale, Arizona newspaper

22:55.504 --> 22:58.289
in the late '90s, early 2000s.

22:58.333 --> 23:00.030
Now, this is a
mainstream publication,

23:00.074 --> 23:01.989
so the odds are they
wouldn't be overtly racist.

23:02.032 --> 23:05.166
But writers tend to reveal
themselves

23:05.209 --> 23:08.517
by their word choices
and speech patterns.

23:08.561 --> 23:10.214
So let's meet our author.

23:12.303 --> 23:14.305
STEVE:
Roger Barton.

23:14.349 --> 23:15.655
Russell's old cellmate.

23:15.698 --> 23:17.396
STEVE: Guess
where we're going?

23:21.225 --> 23:23.358
You can't drive any faster
than this, man? Step on it.

23:23.402 --> 23:26.013
Usually you ask me
to drive slower.Well, not today.

23:26.056 --> 23:27.536
Anything you want
to talk about, buddy?

23:27.580 --> 23:29.320
What you trying to say, man?

23:29.364 --> 23:31.366
Back at HQ, you were watching
those videos,

23:31.410 --> 23:33.455
balling up your fists
pretty good.Just drive, please.

23:33.499 --> 23:34.804
Keep your eyes on the road.
Just drive.

23:34.848 --> 23:35.979
All right.

23:45.380 --> 23:49.340
Commander McGarrett,
to what do I owe this...

23:53.040 --> 23:54.998
GROVER:
Steve.

23:55.042 --> 23:56.347
Steve!

23:56.391 --> 23:58.088
Get up.

24:01.483 --> 24:02.484
Found those videos.

24:02.528 --> 24:04.268
You wrote those speeches.

24:04.312 --> 24:06.662
Where'd you send that minion
of yours with that bomb?

24:06.706 --> 24:10.231
If I knew, maybe you could
get it out of me, big fella.

24:10.274 --> 24:13.321
Connor has chosen
his own destination.

24:13.364 --> 24:15.366
I guess your Wizard
told you to smarten up

24:15.410 --> 24:17.891
since you got
no swastika tattoos.

24:17.934 --> 24:19.501
You're clean-cut,
most of you

24:19.545 --> 24:21.503
are wearing suits now;
it's getting harder and harder

24:21.547 --> 24:23.070
to pick you guys out
in the world.

24:23.113 --> 24:25.507
And in the joint.
It's no wonder he's been flying

24:25.551 --> 24:26.682
under the radar.

24:26.726 --> 24:28.467
Halawa's an extremely
diverse environment.

24:28.510 --> 24:30.338
Wouldn't be
the most welcome spot

24:30.381 --> 24:33.863
for a neo-Nazi
piece of trash like this.

24:33.907 --> 24:35.909
No, no, no, no.
I'm not the trash.

24:35.952 --> 24:37.519
I'm the one
cleaning it up.

24:37.563 --> 24:39.521
Do you feel me, dawg?

24:42.568 --> 24:43.873
Yeah, come on.

24:43.917 --> 24:46.267
As bad as I'd like
to crack your head open

24:46.310 --> 24:48.051
against this windowsill
like an egg,

24:48.095 --> 24:49.357
I need some information.

24:49.400 --> 24:51.185
Now what is this lunatic
gonna do next?

24:51.228 --> 24:52.534
Where is he taking that van?!

24:52.578 --> 24:55.537
Now, I-I expect this kind
of savagery from him,

24:55.581 --> 24:57.191
but you, you're
the real disappointment.

24:57.234 --> 24:59.236
I got
to hear this, Lou.

24:59.280 --> 25:01.674
Let him go. I got to hear
this, please. Come on.

25:04.633 --> 25:06.766
Instead of aligning yourself
with your people,

25:06.809 --> 25:08.985
you've allowed yourself
to become a stooge

25:09.029 --> 25:12.162
for the politically-correct
neo-Marxists

25:12.206 --> 25:17.820
who are trying to turn
this country into a place

25:17.864 --> 25:19.779
where the worst possible crime
is a white man

25:19.822 --> 25:21.476
speaking his mind.

25:21.520 --> 25:23.826
Let's get one thing
straight, all right?

25:23.870 --> 25:26.394
You are not my people.

25:26.437 --> 25:28.396
My grandfather,

25:28.439 --> 25:30.790
he died defending this country

25:30.833 --> 25:32.705
from pricks just like you.

25:32.748 --> 25:33.967
That's it and that's all.

25:34.010 --> 25:36.709
I'm not taking this anymore.

25:36.752 --> 25:38.275
You know what?
I'm done talking.

25:38.319 --> 25:40.495
I'm gonna throw you a beating
you'll never forget.

25:40.539 --> 25:42.976
Oh, no, no. It's too late
for that, now.

25:43.019 --> 25:44.804
The reckoning
has already begun.

25:44.847 --> 25:46.719
Hold on.

25:46.762 --> 25:50.200
Commander McGarrett,
found this in a stash spot.My man.

25:51.637 --> 25:52.681
I told you

25:52.725 --> 25:54.465
shaking down that cell
would pay off.

25:57.164 --> 25:59.906
Prison phone calls are recorded

25:59.949 --> 26:01.951
unless you got
your own personal burner.

26:01.995 --> 26:03.518
You were scared, huh?

26:03.562 --> 26:06.521
I was just messing
with you, dawg.

26:06.565 --> 26:08.610
STEVE:
If you ain't gonna talk,

26:08.654 --> 26:10.220
I'm pretty sure this will.

26:13.484 --> 26:14.834
JERRY:
Commander, we got the SIM data

26:14.877 --> 26:16.313
you sent over from the burner.

26:16.357 --> 26:18.185
Running it now.STEVE: All right, guys.

26:18.228 --> 26:19.578
I got Tani on
the other line.

26:19.621 --> 26:21.580
Call me when you
got something.

26:21.623 --> 26:22.929
Yeah, we got a
hit on the van.

26:22.972 --> 26:24.234
We're on the
way right now.

26:24.278 --> 26:26.410
Who called it in?Witness said a guy matching

26:26.454 --> 26:28.369
Russell's description parked
a red van and walked off.

26:28.412 --> 26:30.240
Dropping you a pin now.

26:30.284 --> 26:32.112
STEVE:
Okay, I got it.

26:32.155 --> 26:33.461
We're, like, 20 minutes out.

26:33.504 --> 26:35.028
Call HPD, have them
set up a perimeter.

26:35.071 --> 26:37.247
We'll see you there.Copy that.

26:50.086 --> 26:52.567
What's taking so long?Captain says
it's protocol

26:52.611 --> 26:55.048
for the robot
to make first approach.

26:55.091 --> 26:56.658
When? Next Thursday?

26:59.182 --> 27:00.706
I got movement in the van.

27:04.361 --> 27:05.885
Screw it.Tani?

27:05.928 --> 27:09.584
Tani! You gotta be
kidding me. Tani!

27:14.284 --> 27:15.677
Clear.

27:15.721 --> 27:17.592
Connor Russell,
get out of the van, now!

27:23.642 --> 27:25.513
Damn it, he's trying
to throw us off.

27:25.556 --> 27:27.428
Of course he kept the
white driver alive.

27:28.472 --> 27:30.431
That maniac stole my truck!

27:54.324 --> 27:57.458
All right, we got HPD and HDOT
looking for this new truck.

27:57.501 --> 27:58.720
Please tell me you got
something off the SIM

27:58.764 --> 28:00.287
that came out of
Barton's burner.

28:00.330 --> 28:02.506
Yep, four frequent contacts

28:02.550 --> 28:03.899
in addition to Connor Russell.

28:03.943 --> 28:05.466
Yeah, and using
those five numbers,

28:05.509 --> 28:07.729
we found a group chat
on the shadowy app

28:07.773 --> 28:10.601
Tyrade, which is a go-to
platform for white nationalists

28:10.645 --> 28:13.169
after they get kicked off of
mainstream sites like Twitter

28:13.213 --> 28:15.606
and Facebook Messenger.What were they
chatting about?

28:15.650 --> 28:18.174
"The reckoning."
Whatever that means.

28:18.218 --> 28:19.654
Also found an encrypted video

28:19.698 --> 28:21.743
that Russell messaged
to the entire group

28:21.787 --> 28:23.353
which has yet to post
on their boards.

28:23.397 --> 28:24.615
And he told his buddies
that it was

28:24.659 --> 28:27.749
set to automatically post
on a public forum

28:27.793 --> 28:29.751
at 6:00 p.m. tonight.Okay, well, it's got to be

28:29.795 --> 28:31.753
some kind of announcement
for after the bombing.

28:31.797 --> 28:34.103
You know? Like claiming credit?Well, they are terrorists.

28:34.147 --> 28:36.758
Well, I'm working to crack
the encryption now.

28:39.761 --> 28:41.197
Bingo.

28:41.241 --> 28:43.460
: On behalf
of United Aryan Division.

28:43.504 --> 28:45.854
I'd like to begin
with a message of thanks.

28:45.898 --> 28:47.551
Thanks for having us
in Honolulu.

28:48.944 --> 28:50.554
In Seattle.

28:50.598 --> 28:51.991
In Denver.

28:52.034 --> 28:53.209
Chicago.

28:53.253 --> 28:54.733
And in Virginia Beach.

28:54.776 --> 28:56.735
Five cities.

28:56.778 --> 28:58.780
They're detonating bombs
coast-to-coast.

28:58.824 --> 29:01.000
"Blood from sea to shining sea."And we're just getting started.

29:07.136 --> 29:09.095
Come on, sweetie.
Let's go.

29:09.138 --> 29:11.184
You too, Trevor.

29:26.939 --> 29:28.201
STEVE: All right,
these guys have got locations

29:28.244 --> 29:29.506
in five different cities--

29:29.550 --> 29:31.073
which means thousands
of potential victims--

29:31.117 --> 29:32.814
and it's going down any minute.Yeah, but the problem is,

29:32.858 --> 29:34.816
we don't know where.GROVER: What
about the chat?

29:34.860 --> 29:36.165
Do they name any targets
in the chat?

29:36.209 --> 29:38.124
Scrolling back through it now.

29:40.126 --> 29:41.997
There-- A link to a document

29:42.041 --> 29:44.086
called "Fireworks
Shopping List." Open that.

29:46.132 --> 29:48.003
Yahtzee. This doc lists
all five targets.

29:48.047 --> 29:49.918
Honolulu's target is
Wailele Community Center.

29:49.962 --> 29:51.920
GROVER: There's got to be
at least a couple
hundred kids there.

29:51.964 --> 29:53.356
Jerry, get FBI and local PDs

29:53.400 --> 29:56.011
to those other targets right
now. Do that right now.

29:56.055 --> 29:58.144
Junior, call HPD.
Have 'em set up a perimeter

29:58.187 --> 29:59.623
while we intercept
the bomber. Grover...Got it.

29:59.667 --> 30:00.799
I'm gonna call the center.

30:00.842 --> 30:01.930
I'm gonna have
'em start evac

30:01.974 --> 30:03.062
from the back.All right, good.

30:03.105 --> 30:04.628
Grover, Junior,
you guys are with me.

30:04.672 --> 30:06.195
Let's go. Jerry,
I want eyes on that place.

30:06.239 --> 30:08.502
You understand?
Dig into the security system.

30:08.545 --> 30:09.720
Comm up.
Let me know what you see.

30:09.764 --> 30:11.722
Copy that.

30:45.800 --> 30:47.802
Guys, I got a van
parked by the north entrance.

30:56.115 --> 30:57.551
Okay, we got movement.

30:58.595 --> 30:59.466
It's Russell.

30:59.509 --> 31:01.947
Repeat, suspect is on site.

31:09.606 --> 31:11.478
Commander, we got a problem.

31:11.521 --> 31:13.175
Looks like Russell's got
a grip detonator.

31:23.098 --> 31:24.839
STEVE:
Give it to me!

31:38.026 --> 31:39.245
Take the shot!

31:39.288 --> 31:40.202
I can't!

31:45.077 --> 31:47.514
Suspect is down. Approach.
Repeat, suspect is down.

31:47.557 --> 31:49.690
Request bomb squad
and immediate evac.

31:52.562 --> 31:54.695
GROVER:
Careful.

31:54.738 --> 31:56.088
Careful.

32:01.658 --> 32:03.617
Keep moving! Keep moving!

32:11.842 --> 32:13.148
GROVER:
All right.

32:13.192 --> 32:15.324
Well, it should only take 'em,

32:15.368 --> 32:17.326
I don't know, about 20 minutes
to defuse the bomb.

32:17.370 --> 32:19.198
So you can relax.

32:19.241 --> 32:20.851
Well, don't relax.

32:20.895 --> 32:23.506
Look, I've seen you
play football, so, uh,

32:23.550 --> 32:25.944
don't go all butterfingers
on us now.

What are you doing here?

33:14.383 --> 33:17.560
Every now and then,
a brother needs his local.

33:18.605 --> 33:19.910
Look, man,

33:19.954 --> 33:21.782
if you came down here

33:21.825 --> 33:23.175
for me to spill my guts,

33:23.218 --> 33:24.698
then you're gonna have
to settle in,

33:24.741 --> 33:26.308
'cause it's a long story.

33:26.352 --> 33:28.832
♪ Lord, one day...

33:45.023 --> 33:48.330
June 1988.

33:51.333 --> 33:54.380
One of my cousins was
graduating from high school

33:54.423 --> 33:55.859
down in Belleville, Illinois,

33:55.903 --> 33:57.861
in Southern Illinois
where most of my family's from.

33:57.905 --> 33:59.385
And...

33:59.428 --> 34:00.386
I'm driving.

34:00.429 --> 34:01.822
After about five or six hours,

34:01.865 --> 34:03.389
my stomach started growling,

34:03.432 --> 34:04.999
telling me I needed
to put something in it.

34:05.043 --> 34:07.784
So I took
the first exit I could.

34:07.828 --> 34:11.397
Entered a town called
Elkhart, Illinois,

34:11.440 --> 34:15.270
and found
a roadside little divey

34:15.314 --> 34:16.880
cafe or whatever.

34:16.924 --> 34:18.186
Get myself
something to eat.

34:18.230 --> 34:21.450
Now, let me preface this
by saying--

34:21.494 --> 34:24.801
since you don't know about
Elkhart, Illinois, I assume--

34:24.845 --> 34:27.413
that it is the country.

34:27.456 --> 34:32.113
And I'm talking country,
country-ass country.

34:32.157 --> 34:34.376
Like time warp country.

34:34.420 --> 34:36.552
So, of course, when, uh,

34:36.596 --> 34:39.338
this face goes into that, uh,

34:39.381 --> 34:40.774
that little divey cafe,

34:40.817 --> 34:43.690
I get more
than a few sideways looks

34:43.733 --> 34:48.042
from the two good ol' boys
sitting at the bar.

34:48.086 --> 34:50.479
Didn't bother me.
Nothing I hadn't seen before.

34:50.523 --> 34:51.828
Just sat down, ordered my food,

34:51.872 --> 34:54.831
and started eating.

34:54.875 --> 34:59.097
But, um, not long after I did,

34:59.140 --> 35:01.011
a couple walked in.

35:01.055 --> 35:02.143
Black couple.

35:02.187 --> 35:03.536
And, um...

35:03.579 --> 35:05.494
to this day,

35:05.538 --> 35:07.844
I have no idea

35:07.888 --> 35:11.413
why them two
redneck sons of bitches

35:11.457 --> 35:12.675
chose them instead of me,

35:12.719 --> 35:14.416
but they did.

35:14.460 --> 35:16.853
Because
as soon as they sat down--

35:16.897 --> 35:20.379
and I mean as soon

35:20.422 --> 35:22.598
as they sat down,

35:22.642 --> 35:25.035
them two good ol' boys
got off their stools

35:25.079 --> 35:27.037
and went right for 'em.

35:29.518 --> 35:31.129
And one of them said
something that...

35:33.218 --> 35:36.134
...I cannot repeat.

35:37.222 --> 35:40.442
Moments like that
happen man, and...

35:40.486 --> 35:42.749
you know what's coming;
hairs on your arms

35:42.792 --> 35:45.665
stand up, you get tense
all over your whole body.

35:45.708 --> 35:49.321
You feel... your anger
just welling up.

35:51.410 --> 35:53.194
The blood rushes to your ears

35:53.238 --> 35:56.502
and it feels like somebody
just set a damn match to them.

35:58.721 --> 36:01.507
I heard those words
and I immediately found

36:01.550 --> 36:03.596
a desire to join
the conversation.

36:04.945 --> 36:06.729
So I went over there.

36:06.773 --> 36:10.516
And... the three of us
just went at it.

36:10.559 --> 36:12.300
Like animals.

36:12.344 --> 36:15.477
And what started on the
inside of that place

36:15.521 --> 36:17.523
spilled into the outside,

36:17.566 --> 36:19.873
in the parking lot.

36:19.916 --> 36:23.050
And them boys gave me
an ass whupping

36:23.093 --> 36:24.704
and I gave them one, too.

36:24.747 --> 36:26.532
But, uh, it was two of them.

36:26.575 --> 36:27.968
So...

36:28.011 --> 36:29.361
When the cops showed up,

36:29.404 --> 36:31.319
I am not ashamed to say

36:31.363 --> 36:33.539
that I was not upset.

36:33.582 --> 36:36.019
I had my share

36:36.063 --> 36:39.458
of lumps and bruises and blood.

36:40.633 --> 36:42.591
But the thing

36:42.635 --> 36:45.246
that stood out the most
from that is...

36:45.290 --> 36:47.379
breaking a finger.
Same finger right here.

36:50.817 --> 36:54.255
So I showed up
at my cousin's graduation

36:54.299 --> 36:56.126
looking like I had been
in a hatchet fight

36:56.170 --> 36:58.259
and everybody had a hatchet
but me.

36:59.608 --> 37:01.958
Fingers taped together

37:02.002 --> 37:04.483
with a makeshift splint

37:04.526 --> 37:06.311
made out of Scotch tape

37:06.354 --> 37:10.271
that I picked up
from a Shop 'n Save.

37:10.315 --> 37:14.014
I'm really sorry
you went through that, Lou.

37:15.407 --> 37:17.757
I appreciate that, man. I-I...

37:18.975 --> 37:21.195
Funny enough, though,
I don't really...

37:21.239 --> 37:23.980
I don't really think about it
as much here, you know?

37:24.024 --> 37:27.593
This place is-is certainly

37:27.636 --> 37:29.464
much different, and, um...

37:29.508 --> 37:30.900
things like that

37:30.944 --> 37:32.554
don't happen.

37:32.598 --> 37:34.687
I tell you, man,

37:34.730 --> 37:35.731
this damn...

37:35.775 --> 37:37.211
this damn finger is the reason

37:37.255 --> 37:40.388
why I can never put it
completely out of my mind.

37:40.432 --> 37:44.087
Because an hour
before it rains, and it...

37:44.131 --> 37:48.048
this damn finger takes me right
back to that nightmare. I...

37:49.005 --> 37:50.790
And it rains a lot

37:50.833 --> 37:52.357
on this island of yours.

37:52.400 --> 37:53.619
I love you, man.

37:54.533 --> 37:56.012
I love you right back.

37:56.056 --> 37:57.449
Cheers.

38:29.176 --> 38:31.961
I just wanted to say thank you.

38:32.005 --> 38:33.485
For everything.

Don't cry, Annie.

I guarantee

39:09.999 --> 39:12.654
in both directions you're
seeing people who are here today

39:12.698 --> 39:14.656

Luka did for them.

39:14.700 --> 39:15.962

39:21.837 --> 39:24.623
and he touched your life,

39:24.666 --> 39:26.581
I want you
to take out your phone...

39:28.366 --> 39:29.628
...and turn on the flashlight

39:29.671 --> 39:33.066
and hold it up like this.

39:35.764 --> 39:38.027
Higher.

39:44.077 --> 39:47.210
I want him to see us down here

39:47.254 --> 39:49.517
and see us saying,

39:49.561 --> 39:53.739
"Thank you, and we love you."
