00:45.577 --> 00:47.910
I know you don't mean that.

00:48.406 --> 00:50.093
We'll talk about this later.

00:52.235 --> 00:54.468
You know how tired I've been.

00:54.493 --> 00:57.320
Amou, don't forget, I
have to leave at nine.

00:57.345 --> 00:59.478
Not a second earlier.

01:04.297 --> 01:06.594
I know, but you can do that without me.

01:06.819 --> 01:08.527
Then I must've forgotten.

01:09.970 --> 01:12.993
I'm just about to eat.
I'll call you after.

02:31.695 --> 02:35.364
Um... Do you remember me, sir?

02:37.084 --> 02:38.339
You made my dinner.

02:40.294 --> 02:41.726
Look out!

04:30.635 --> 04:32.835
Amou, Amou! Can you hear me?

04:32.860 --> 04:35.840
Your left arm is broken.
Try not to move it.

04:38.738 --> 04:42.473
I... I can't see!

04:46.968 --> 04:49.066
You're bleeding behind your eye.

05:12.108 --> 05:15.275
If I don't do this now, you'll go blind.

05:15.300 --> 05:16.627
Hold still.

05:16.812 --> 05:18.746
I'll try to make it quick.

05:20.956 --> 05:24.103
Ahh!

06:00.816 --> 06:03.156
Can you breathe?

06:22.835 --> 06:24.968
Sir? Sir?

06:24.993 --> 06:26.637
We can't stay here.

06:32.134 --> 06:36.073
You have a skull fracture on the
same side as a blown pupil.

06:40.408 --> 06:43.487
Bashir! We need to go!

06:51.982 --> 06:53.314
Sir.

06:54.497 --> 06:56.393
You have an epidural hematoma.

06:56.418 --> 06:59.378
If I don't relieve the pressure
right now you're going to die.

07:00.978 --> 07:02.411
Sir?

07:02.603 --> 07:04.885
I'm not going to let you die here.

07:05.159 --> 07:06.761
I know what I'm doing.

07:22.630 --> 07:24.280
Bashir!

07:42.041 --> 07:47.158
- Synced and corrected by martythecrazy -

07:56.511 --> 07:58.271
ETA seven minutes,

07:58.296 --> 08:02.140
unconscious with a GCS of
10, O2 sat, 88 percent.

08:02.165 --> 08:03.791
Did they all get out?

08:03.816 --> 08:06.267
- Where's everyone else?
- You're okay, buddy.

08:06.292 --> 08:08.205
Make that conscious.

08:08.230 --> 08:10.979
You've been in a serious accident.

08:11.004 --> 08:13.578
You're going to the best
hospital in the city.

08:21.674 --> 08:24.402
We're barely keeping up. This
is the abdominal trauma?

08:24.427 --> 08:26.549
Possible smoke inhalation. Bashir Ali.

08:26.574 --> 08:28.190
- 29 years old.
- Okay. Sir.

08:28.215 --> 08:30.049
No, that needs to stay on.
I'm Dr. Leblanc,

08:30.074 --> 08:32.448
I'll be taking care of you.
How many victims were there?

08:32.472 --> 08:34.563
Five in the restaurant,
two in the street.

08:34.799 --> 08:35.876
Vitals?

08:35.902 --> 08:37.994
BP's normal but he's tachy at 120

08:39.044 --> 08:41.690
The police say don't discharge
anyone until they find the driver.

08:41.715 --> 08:43.720
Okay. Get this guy's CBC lytes, ABG.

08:43.745 --> 08:44.745
I think I have to go.

08:44.770 --> 08:46.369
No. Sir, you can't leave, you need help.

08:46.394 --> 08:48.940
COHB and a stat portable chest X-ray,

08:48.965 --> 08:51.635
and where is Dr. Bishop? He lives
for how busy we are tonight.

08:51.660 --> 08:52.986
No one has seen him.

08:53.011 --> 08:54.267
I paged him three times.

08:54.292 --> 08:56.783
- No, no, the others...
- Sir, please you need to stay down.

08:56.808 --> 08:58.664
I have to make sure...

09:01.381 --> 09:03.816
Dr. Hunter! Got one of your own, here.

09:03.841 --> 09:05.338
You need to see this.

09:06.902 --> 09:09.049
- Mags!
- Don't move!

09:10.738 --> 09:12.471
Dr. Jed Bishop, GCS three.

09:12.496 --> 09:15.152
Significant head injury with a
blown pupil and skull fracture.

09:15.177 --> 09:17.276
Rate 1-10 with a 95 on 50.

09:17.301 --> 09:18.815
Chief lost a lot of blood.

09:18.900 --> 09:21.033
Wait, Doctor Bishop was
in that restaurant?

09:21.058 --> 09:23.143
Okay, uh, okay...

09:23.168 --> 09:25.412
We, we need to intubate
and get him to CT.

09:25.437 --> 09:27.776
I got this, I'll page an ER surgery.
Follow me.

09:29.098 --> 09:30.364
Coming through!

09:30.389 --> 09:32.541
I guess June's got this?

09:32.566 --> 09:33.992
Well she said it was him, right?

09:34.102 --> 09:36.635
Guys, this is a level one
mass-casualty incident.

09:36.660 --> 09:38.916
You know the protocol and
you need to keep moving.

09:38.941 --> 09:40.174
I know, I saw him.

09:40.199 --> 09:42.994
Let the Dr. Bishop he's
prepared us for this.

09:48.242 --> 09:50.612
Sir, sir, you need to sit
down, you're bleeding!

09:50.637 --> 09:52.221
Please help! Please.

09:52.246 --> 09:53.947
Just sit down. Put his mask on.

09:53.972 --> 09:57.517
You have to stay put. Okay?
We'll be right with you.

10:09.499 --> 10:11.600
Hi, ma'am, my name is Officer Reid.

10:11.625 --> 10:13.780
I'm gonna take a statement
from you, if that's okay.

10:13.805 --> 10:15.238
Yeah, sure.

10:15.263 --> 10:17.517
So, were you driving your
car near the restaurant?

10:17.542 --> 10:18.542
Yeah.

10:18.567 --> 10:20.424
Did you happen to see the truck coming?

10:20.449 --> 10:22.123
Yeah, I guess.

10:22.148 --> 10:23.955
And did you see from which direction?

10:23.980 --> 10:25.908
I just spoke to your colleague earlier.

10:25.933 --> 10:27.001
Uh-huh.

10:27.311 --> 10:29.705
Uh, did you happen to see the driver?

10:29.730 --> 10:31.160
Could you describe him or her?

10:31.185 --> 10:33.425
No, I can't, the truck
came out of nowhere.

10:33.450 --> 10:35.024
I swerved my car out of the way.

10:35.049 --> 10:36.744
Is this some kind of
attack, or something?

10:36.769 --> 10:39.270
We're working on it.

10:40.392 --> 10:42.915
Incoming! Another victim
from the truck crash.

10:42.940 --> 10:46.064
Alice DeMarco, 52 years old.
Decreased LOC.

10:46.354 --> 10:48.805
My daughter, she needs me.

10:48.830 --> 10:51.041
Was she in the restaurant with you?
Alice?

10:51.066 --> 10:53.236
Alice? She lost consciousness.

10:53.261 --> 10:55.198
She can be V-tach.

10:55.691 --> 10:58.700
Let's get her on three. One, two, three!

10:59.117 --> 11:02.330
Support out on three! One, two, three!

11:02.513 --> 11:04.208
Got it.

11:04.635 --> 11:07.190
- Cardio right before intubation.
- That's ready.

11:07.411 --> 11:10.338
Let's get her on oxygen. I
need 50 ketamine IV, push!

11:11.330 --> 11:13.049
200 J, synchronized.

11:13.074 --> 11:15.240
Charging.

11:15.265 --> 11:17.032
Has somebody performed
CPR on this woman?

11:17.057 --> 11:18.994
The EMS said they found
her with a pulse.

11:19.189 --> 11:20.568
Okay, clear!

11:20.593 --> 11:22.658
You should know that her heart stopped.

11:22.814 --> 11:25.686
- Before the paramedics arrived.
- Get him out of here.

11:29.596 --> 11:30.973
Let's intubate first.

11:30.998 --> 11:32.596
What were you doing in there?

11:32.621 --> 11:33.815
I don't know.

11:33.840 --> 11:36.509
That woman, her doctor needs to
know that her heart stopped.

11:36.534 --> 11:38.001
Okay, now she knows.

11:38.026 --> 11:40.688
But the patients at this hospital
are not your concern, alright?

11:40.713 --> 11:42.205
I need you to wait right here,

11:42.230 --> 11:43.635
get medical attention

11:43.660 --> 11:46.105
and then give a statement to
the police about the accident.

11:46.130 --> 11:48.433
- Do you understand me?
- TT is not looking good.

11:48.458 --> 11:50.224
He's fading fast, and check this out.

11:50.249 --> 11:52.924
I think he's got a drill
hole in his skull.

11:53.119 --> 11:56.439
Significant epidural
hematoma and cerebral edema.

11:56.464 --> 11:59.136
We need to get Dr.
Bishop up to the OR now.

12:10.251 --> 12:11.649
Bashir.

12:12.765 --> 12:14.431
Oh! How are you feeling?

12:14.456 --> 12:15.737
What did you do to me?

12:15.762 --> 12:17.907
I had to relieve the
pressure behind your eye.

12:17.932 --> 12:19.494
You're gonna get your vision back.

12:19.519 --> 12:21.492
You saved everyone.

12:21.741 --> 12:23.674
Ahmed. Did he get out?

12:23.699 --> 12:25.954
I told him that he was in there, but...

12:35.707 --> 12:37.341
Thank you, Bashir.

12:41.838 --> 12:43.701
He was just here.

12:44.004 --> 12:45.641
What is it with this guy?

12:45.666 --> 12:47.518
You were saying he seemed jumpy.

12:48.171 --> 12:50.830
Oh, maybe in shock, he
was in a major accident.

12:51.045 --> 12:52.862
You have an address on him?

12:52.887 --> 12:54.892
Uh, no, we haven't registered him yet.

12:54.917 --> 12:56.377
We've been a little bit swamped.

12:56.402 --> 12:57.904
Maybe he didn't want to be.

12:58.310 --> 12:59.571
Registered.

13:00.431 --> 13:02.866
You said he's Middle Eastern.

13:12.574 --> 13:14.712
Hey! You!

13:15.855 --> 13:17.799
You gotta come with me.

13:31.805 --> 13:34.354
Why were you such in a
hurry to get outta there?

13:34.379 --> 13:36.267
- I wasn't.
- No?

13:36.802 --> 13:39.169
You were discharged from this hospital?

13:40.305 --> 13:42.908
You were told to wait and see a doctor.

13:42.998 --> 13:45.298
I know if a doctor told me I
needed medical attention,

13:45.323 --> 13:46.337
I'd be sure to get it.

13:46.362 --> 13:47.704
I'm not seriously injured.

13:47.729 --> 13:49.930
Everyone else in that truck's path was.

13:49.955 --> 13:51.749
Lucky you're fine.

13:52.453 --> 13:54.545
And you were also told to stick around

13:54.570 --> 13:55.854
and give a statement to me.

13:55.879 --> 13:57.720
I saw that truck one
second before it hit.

13:57.745 --> 14:00.383
- I didn't think that would help you.
- That makes you a witness,

14:00.416 --> 14:02.196
and a witness that doesn't
cooperate is guilty

14:02.221 --> 14:04.095
of obstructing a peace officer.

14:04.710 --> 14:07.571
That, uh, restaurant is a crime scene.

14:08.017 --> 14:09.986
- What were you doing there?
- I work there.

14:10.011 --> 14:12.298
I'd like to see some
identification, please.

14:12.548 --> 14:14.479
- Is that necessary?
- Yes.

14:24.919 --> 14:26.813
Sit tight, Mr. Hamed.

14:31.694 --> 14:34.446
Hey, Mags. Your patient
from the truck crash?

14:34.471 --> 14:36.149
- Yeah.
- Her daughter's here.

14:36.321 --> 14:38.173
- That woman with the baby.
- Yeah.

14:38.198 --> 14:40.839
- She's looking for you.
- Okay, thanks.

14:43.070 --> 14:45.804
There's an electrical disturbance
in your mother's heart,

14:45.829 --> 14:47.415
which is causing it to beat irregularly.

14:47.440 --> 14:49.507
I just talked to her.

14:49.712 --> 14:51.243
Why is this happening to us?

14:51.268 --> 14:53.462
It's not uncommon after
trauma for the heart to...

14:53.487 --> 14:55.618
Is it time for you to eat?

14:55.651 --> 14:57.126
He should be sleeping.

14:57.151 --> 14:59.065
Oh. Uh...

14:59.236 --> 15:01.602
Does she have a history of heart disease

15:01.627 --> 15:03.798
or is she on any medications
you're aware of?

15:03.823 --> 15:06.187
No. I don't know.

15:06.504 --> 15:09.236
Okay. Well, we had to intubate
to manage her breathing.

15:09.261 --> 15:11.470
She's in an induced coma while
we isolated the cause...

15:11.495 --> 15:13.028
Is my mother gonna die?

15:13.053 --> 15:15.907
- She can't die.
- We're doing everything we can.

15:15.932 --> 15:17.821
You said her heart stopped
in that restaurant?

15:17.846 --> 15:19.377
How is she even alive?

15:19.806 --> 15:21.259
I'm still figuring that out

15:21.284 --> 15:24.717
but the best doctor I
know was there with her.

15:34.060 --> 15:36.475
Those other victims were
lucky Bishop was with them.

15:36.500 --> 15:38.858
He needs a craniotomy
to evacuate what's left

15:38.899 --> 15:40.655
of the hematoma and relieve swelling.

15:41.760 --> 15:44.030
You think he gave himself

15:44.055 --> 15:46.225
a Burr Hole with a power drill?

15:46.655 --> 15:49.423
For a blind shot, it's right
where it needed to be.

15:49.448 --> 15:50.882
I wanna scrub in.

15:50.907 --> 15:52.483
You're a trauma surgeon, June.

15:52.508 --> 15:53.804
I got Dr. Bishop this far.

15:53.829 --> 15:55.764
We don't need you, Dr. Curtis.

15:55.789 --> 15:58.773
But with their chief down, your
fellow residents in Emerge do.

15:58.798 --> 15:59.913
Fine.

16:08.056 --> 16:09.733
Aren't you in on Bishop's craniotomy?

16:09.758 --> 16:12.180
- They have it covered.
- That's too bad.

16:13.087 --> 16:14.820
Looking directly into Bishop's brain

16:14.845 --> 16:16.616
might be like staring
into the face of God.

16:18.092 --> 16:20.179
They're saying he saved
everyone in that restaurant

16:20.204 --> 16:21.732
before saving herself.

16:21.987 --> 16:24.776
Like starting a woman's heart,
stopped some guy from going blind.

16:25.089 --> 16:27.354
Survival rate for an
emergency craniotomy?

16:27.379 --> 16:29.014
50 percent in most cases.

16:29.039 --> 16:30.115
June...

16:30.774 --> 16:32.660
Do you think he's gonna make it?

16:49.212 --> 16:50.452
<i>Switchboard.</i>

16:50.477 --> 16:52.889
Can I make a call outside the hospital?
It's an emergency.

16:52.914 --> 16:55.975
<i>Uh, not from this line.
It's internal only.</i>

17:05.887 --> 17:08.271
And when did your heart start racing?

17:08.297 --> 17:10.763
We were having dinner, so
we brought dinner here.

17:10.789 --> 17:11.998
Want some?

17:12.022 --> 17:13.483
I've eaten, thanks.

17:13.508 --> 17:15.453
The nurse said it would
stop, we think it did.

17:15.989 --> 17:17.412
She's gonna be okay, right?

17:17.742 --> 17:19.914
- Uh, yeah.
- Can we go?

17:23.596 --> 17:25.070
If I do tox screen,

17:25.096 --> 17:26.907
will I find cocaine in your system?

17:26.933 --> 17:28.822
Or any other drugs?

17:29.072 --> 17:31.051
This guy's trying to teach us a lesson.
