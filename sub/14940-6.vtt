WEBVTT

00:00.363 --> 00:01.829
Previously on <i>Alphas...</i>

00:01.897 --> 00:04.861
Agent Sullivan just called.
We have an Alpha missing--

00:04.961 --> 00:06.160
Skylar Adams.

00:06.227 --> 00:08.026
Skylar's smarter than
just about anyone.

00:08.095 --> 00:09.693
She was always
inventing things.

00:09.761 --> 00:13.227
Are you looking
for my mommy?

00:13.295 --> 00:15.828
I was going to head out
to, uh--to the coffee shop.

00:15.895 --> 00:17.761
Are you asking me out
on a date?

00:17.829 --> 00:19.362
If we're gonna try this,

00:19.430 --> 00:20.762
we're gonna need
to take it slow.

00:20.830 --> 00:23.495
Slow is good.

00:25.897 --> 00:27.262
Dr. Rosen...

00:27.330 --> 00:28.796
Cornell Scipio.

00:30.998 --> 00:34.231
- Is that a photic stimulator?
- There's 42 different models.

00:34.299 --> 00:36.398
You remember the young woman
who built you your phone?

00:36.466 --> 00:38.699
- Yeah, Skylar.
- Do you still have it with you?

00:38.766 --> 00:40.198
She said I could call her
on this.

00:40.266 --> 00:41.899
She might be the one
to figure out

00:41.967 --> 00:44.801
how this thing works.

00:44.869 --> 00:47.670
Identities of all volunteers
remain classified.

00:47.737 --> 00:50.504
The purpose of the study
is to test reactions

00:50.572 --> 00:52.406
to various frequencies
of light oscillation.

00:52.473 --> 00:56.008
Project Bluebird,
Artichoke, Paper Clip--

00:56.076 --> 00:57.542
you believe these names?

00:57.610 --> 01:00.345
These Cold War programs were
the government's first attempts

01:00.412 --> 01:03.346
to explore the limits of
the human neurological system.

01:03.414 --> 01:05.948
And one of
the more promising experiments

01:06.016 --> 01:07.817
was photic stimulation--

01:07.884 --> 01:10.518
visual stimulus
to alter brain activity.

01:10.586 --> 01:12.252
But as you can see,

01:12.320 --> 01:13.654
some pretty
horrible results.

01:13.721 --> 01:15.755
I still don't get
the connection to your toy here.

01:15.823 --> 01:18.157
You said they use this
to treat people for epilepsy

01:18.224 --> 01:20.458
and Parkinson's
and lazy eye syndrome.

01:20.526 --> 01:23.026
Well, Bill, Stanton Parish
somehow managed to coerce

01:23.094 --> 01:25.195
Senator Burton to fast-track
this particular device

01:25.262 --> 01:26.462
through the FDA.

01:26.530 --> 01:27.997
I seriously doubt
he was concerned

01:28.065 --> 01:29.698
with lazy eye syndrome.

01:29.766 --> 01:31.199
So you had Kat
take this thing apart.

01:31.267 --> 01:32.600
She couldn't find anything.

01:32.668 --> 01:33.768
Yeah, but why?

01:33.836 --> 01:35.869
Why, Bill, was it used
so deliberately

01:35.937 --> 01:38.271
on that Jason Miller kid
in the hospital?

01:38.339 --> 01:40.106
It enhanced his Alpha ability,

01:40.173 --> 01:43.141
which put you and the rest
of the team in danger.

01:43.208 --> 01:46.209
Thousands of these are due
to be distributed right now.

01:46.277 --> 01:48.378
I'm convinced that this--
this--well, whatever it is--

01:48.446 --> 01:51.047
is a crucial part
of Parish's war plans.

01:51.114 --> 01:52.814
And I hate to think
what will happen

01:52.882 --> 01:54.249
if I can't figure out
what it does.

01:54.316 --> 01:55.817
Well, whatever it is,

01:55.884 --> 01:58.385
Nathan Cley needs this on his
desk tomorrow morning, okay?

01:58.452 --> 01:59.753
That is evidence.

01:59.820 --> 02:01.354
Yeah, well,
it's not going to be

02:01.421 --> 02:03.355
on Nathan Cley's desk
tomorrow morning.

02:03.423 --> 02:05.857
It's going to be
on Skylar Adams's.

02:05.924 --> 02:07.991
If anyone can figure this out,
it's her.

02:09.000 --> 02:15.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:25.403 --> 02:27.169
You know, I checked.

02:27.237 --> 02:29.105
Health inspectors eat here.

02:29.172 --> 02:30.305
I'm so sorry.

02:30.373 --> 02:32.907
It's--
it's a force of habit.

02:32.975 --> 02:34.275
Oh.

02:34.343 --> 02:36.010
You know what?
I should get going.

02:36.078 --> 02:38.512
You're really not gonna
tell me where you're going?

02:38.579 --> 02:40.914
Dr. Rosen's being really
paranoid about security.

02:40.981 --> 02:42.882
You know
I'm head of tactical, right?

02:42.950 --> 02:44.950
Your boss is making it really
hard for me to do my job.

02:45.018 --> 02:47.018
Do you want to come along
to protect me?

02:49.487 --> 02:53.089
That's sweet.

02:53.156 --> 02:55.824
Look, I just--

02:55.892 --> 02:57.425
I'm sorry.
- No, no--

02:57.493 --> 02:59.060
No, John, I'm sorry.
I--

02:59.127 --> 03:00.227
I'm trying, okay?

03:00.295 --> 03:03.830
And we'll get there, but...

03:03.897 --> 03:07.266
I got to go.

03:08.801 --> 03:10.636
Dr. Rosen,
why do I have to go?

03:10.703 --> 03:12.404
I don't want to go.
I don't like going places.

03:12.472 --> 03:13.705
Gary, you're part
of the team.

03:13.773 --> 03:15.374
And I want everyone
doing security.

03:15.441 --> 03:17.276
No, but Bill--
he does the security.

03:17.343 --> 03:18.577
'Cause Bi--
Bill's the muscle,

03:18.645 --> 03:19.945
and the muscle is
in the arm.

03:20.013 --> 03:21.947
I'm the brain, and the brain
stays in the head.

03:22.015 --> 03:23.348
The office is the head.

03:23.416 --> 03:24.983
That's my metaphor.
Right, right.

03:25.051 --> 03:26.418
That's a great metaphor, Gary,
you are the brains, okay?

03:26.486 --> 03:27.619
Yeah, well,
then tell Dr. Rosen--

03:27.687 --> 03:29.121
the brain stays in the head.

03:29.188 --> 03:31.223
Gary, when Stanton Parish
finds out we have this device,

03:31.290 --> 03:33.058
he's going to come
looking for it.

03:33.125 --> 03:34.492
You are too important
to be left behind.

03:34.560 --> 03:35.660
You monitor signals.

03:35.727 --> 03:36.994
No one else can do that,
all right?

03:37.062 --> 03:38.930
You're going.
Oh, okay. But then you ha-

03:38.998 --> 03:40.998
you have to appease me.

03:41.066 --> 03:42.566
Appease you?

03:42.634 --> 03:45.469
Okay, all right, Gary,
how about you pick

03:45.536 --> 03:46.970
where we stop for lunch?
Yeah, that's good.

03:47.038 --> 03:48.605
How about we let him
drive us to lunch?

03:48.672 --> 03:50.373
- No, no, I'm the shotgun.
- I'm gonna let you drive.

03:50.441 --> 03:52.742
That's fool's gold, Bill.
You never let me drive.

03:52.809 --> 03:53.843
Rachel?

03:56.913 --> 03:59.882
- Where are you going?
- To see a guy about a thing.

03:59.949 --> 04:02.284
You gonna miss me?
No.

04:02.352 --> 04:04.353
Well, I bet I can change
your mind on that.

04:07.057 --> 04:08.490
- Hi.
- Hi.

04:08.558 --> 04:10.426
What, you don't like
office hours?

04:10.494 --> 04:12.361
Sorry.
The subway was late.

04:12.429 --> 04:13.596
Bentley's in the shop?

04:13.663 --> 04:15.598
No. The Bentley
was repossessed.

04:15.665 --> 04:17.399
She couldn't afford
to make the payments.

04:17.466 --> 04:19.702
And she's not allowed to push
anyone anymore to keep the car.

04:19.769 --> 04:21.202
So Nina's going, huh?

04:21.271 --> 04:22.638
Yeah. Look, nothing's
gonna happen, okay?

04:22.706 --> 04:24.040
Just trust me.

04:24.108 --> 04:25.609
It's not you
I'm worried about.

04:25.676 --> 04:27.644
Nina's promised to use
her ability for the, uh--

04:27.712 --> 04:29.246
for the good of all.

04:29.314 --> 04:30.981
Yeah, that's like
asking an alcoholic

04:31.049 --> 04:32.382
to only drink in the office.

04:32.450 --> 04:35.686
I need to do this myself,
so I can handle it.

04:35.754 --> 04:37.989
Give her a chance, okay?
She's trying to change.

04:38.057 --> 04:39.390
Yeah.

04:39.458 --> 04:41.993
Cameron, we need to go.
Give my love to Dani.

04:42.061 --> 04:44.128
Your dad says hi.
All right.

04:48.901 --> 04:50.535
I'm the shotgun.

05:03.449 --> 05:06.183
Nothing but trees--
where are we?

05:06.251 --> 05:08.419
Well, I think
we're almost there, Bill.

05:08.487 --> 05:09.553
I think, I think.

05:09.621 --> 05:11.756
You think?

05:11.824 --> 05:14.358
Doc, what exactly
did Skylar say?

05:14.426 --> 05:15.559
Well, she wasn't
all that specific.

05:15.627 --> 05:17.795
No, she hung up on him.

05:17.863 --> 05:19.464
But I'd already
traced the call.

05:19.531 --> 05:21.799
She's 3.2 miles
north of Route 11.

05:21.867 --> 05:23.701
All right, well,
that's around here, then.

05:23.768 --> 05:25.736
Yeah, it is, but it's all--
it's just trees.

05:25.804 --> 05:27.037
There's trees everywhere...

05:27.105 --> 05:30.307
At least on--on Mapquest
and Google maps.

05:30.375 --> 05:33.811
When you're this far out,
you don't want to be found.

05:33.878 --> 05:35.713
Don't--oh, wait, wait!
Stop, stop!

05:35.780 --> 05:37.081
What, what?

05:37.148 --> 05:39.016
- Gary, what are you doing?
- Gary!

05:40.819 --> 05:42.987
Gary!
What are you doing?

05:43.054 --> 05:44.021
It's all gone!

05:44.089 --> 05:45.723
There's no wi-fi.

05:45.790 --> 05:47.257
There's no 4g.
Everything's gone.

05:47.325 --> 05:49.193
Gary, that's what happens
when you're out in the boonies.

05:49.261 --> 05:50.962
Can you just get back
in the van, please?

05:53.065 --> 05:55.366
This is no good.
We have to turn back now.

05:55.434 --> 05:57.101
We're not turning back,
Gary.

05:57.169 --> 05:59.671
Just don't--don't jump
out of the van again.

05:59.738 --> 06:01.139
I don't like the boonies!

06:05.712 --> 06:06.845
Oh, what's this?

06:06.913 --> 06:09.749
Hey.
How you fellas doing?

06:09.816 --> 06:11.450
Just fine.

06:11.518 --> 06:14.387
But you're on private land.
You need to turn around.

06:14.455 --> 06:16.189
Excuse me, we're looking
for a friend of ours

06:16.257 --> 06:18.091
who lives
somewhere around here.

06:18.159 --> 06:19.926
Her name is Skylar Adams.

06:19.994 --> 06:21.662
Hey, D.C.I.S.

06:21.730 --> 06:23.297
Hey! Hey!

06:23.365 --> 06:25.866
You have to respect that badge.
Give me it back.

06:25.934 --> 06:28.469
You're feds.
Get the hell out of here.

06:28.536 --> 06:29.870
Give me.

06:29.938 --> 06:31.738
- Go!
- All right.

06:31.806 --> 06:33.573
Get out of here.

06:33.641 --> 06:34.674
- Cameron, just--
- move it.

06:34.742 --> 06:35.675
Just go ahead.

06:38.846 --> 06:41.181
Look out!

06:43.184 --> 06:44.985
Whoa!

06:45.053 --> 06:46.853
He's an Alpha.
You're right, Gary.

06:46.921 --> 06:48.956
- What do the other two do?
- We don't want to find out.

06:49.023 --> 06:50.490
- Hey, hey.
- He opens doors.

06:50.558 --> 06:52.392
- Hey, hey, hey, back off.
- Guess you're walking.

06:52.460 --> 06:53.761
What do you think
you're doing?

06:53.828 --> 06:55.162
- Let's go!
- Gower!

06:55.229 --> 06:57.231
Back off!

07:00.835 --> 07:02.803
Hello, Skylar.

07:02.870 --> 07:05.139
Dr. Rosen.

07:05.206 --> 07:06.673
- You're Rosen?
- Yes.

07:06.741 --> 07:08.542
Yes--yes, I am.
And, uh--

07:08.609 --> 07:11.211
and you are?

07:11.279 --> 07:13.981
Skylar, are these folks
friends of yours?

07:14.048 --> 07:16.984
No.

07:17.051 --> 07:18.719
Neither are you.

07:21.523 --> 07:22.856
Skylar?

07:22.924 --> 07:26.059
Go home.

Skylar, listen to me.

I know I promised I'd never
make contact with you again,

08:02.465 --> 08:03.932
but I need your help.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.167
- We don't help outsiders.
- What do you mean, "we"?

08:06.235 --> 08:07.535
I thought you weren't
with those people.

08:07.603 --> 08:10.271
Just tell me what you want.

08:10.339 --> 08:12.540
All right.

08:12.608 --> 08:14.175
Thank you, Nina.

08:15.945 --> 08:17.812
I need you to take a look
at this.

08:17.880 --> 08:20.615
It appears to be
a photic stimulator,

08:20.682 --> 08:22.650
but I think
it's much more than that.

08:22.718 --> 08:24.085
You want to use me
for my abilities?

08:25.620 --> 08:27.455
I'm shocked.

08:27.522 --> 08:30.091
Take it to the genius bar.
Skylar.

08:30.159 --> 08:33.895
Skylar...

08:33.962 --> 08:36.831
This is important.

08:36.899 --> 08:39.067
I took a tremendous risk
helping you elude the NSA.

08:39.134 --> 08:41.303
I did not have to do that.

08:41.370 --> 08:43.638
Really?

08:43.706 --> 08:47.041
You're playing that card?

08:48.610 --> 08:50.645
- Hey! Over here!
- Kids, come this way!

08:50.713 --> 08:51.880
Wait up!

08:51.947 --> 08:54.182
So this is where
you ended up--

08:54.249 --> 08:56.184
a town full of Alphas.

08:56.251 --> 08:58.385
It's just an old summer camp
they fixed up--

08:58.453 --> 09:00.120
a place for refugees.

09:00.188 --> 09:02.256
Refugees from what?

09:02.324 --> 09:04.759
The neuro-typical world...

09:04.826 --> 09:06.127
from you.

09:09.898 --> 09:11.298
You don't look
too impressed.

09:11.366 --> 09:14.068
No. With all these
Alphas here,

09:14.135 --> 09:15.836
you never know
who's a Parish sympathizer.

09:15.903 --> 09:18.171
So we got to keep
our eyes open.

09:18.239 --> 09:19.873
Why don't you stay with Rosen
and the machine?

09:19.941 --> 09:22.909
And I'll do a security check
with, uh, Rachel and Gary.

09:22.977 --> 09:23.844
All right.

09:28.916 --> 09:31.384
Xenon tube, flash header...

09:33.788 --> 09:35.655
50-watt step-down
power supply.

09:35.723 --> 09:39.459
Yeah, yeah,
I know what this is.

09:39.527 --> 09:41.661
It's a photic stimulator.

09:41.729 --> 09:43.263
Skylar, I-I know that.

09:43.330 --> 09:46.166
But t-there's
got to be more to it.

09:46.233 --> 09:47.967
Hey, look who's here.

09:48.035 --> 09:49.802
Zoe, you remember Dr. Rosen.

09:49.870 --> 09:52.871
Hi, Zoe.

09:52.939 --> 09:54.940
- What's this?
- Whoa. Zoe, don't touch.

09:55.008 --> 09:57.308
Don't touch.
I'll show you later.

09:57.376 --> 09:59.610
She never stops.
This is how it always is.

09:59.678 --> 10:01.245
Zoe
what's this?

10:01.313 --> 10:03.514
Zoe, Zoe,
do you like bubbles?

10:03.581 --> 10:06.751
Do you want to know how to blow
a giant bubble that never pops?

10:06.818 --> 10:07.985
How do you do that?

10:08.053 --> 10:11.656
I'll show you.
Come here.

10:11.724 --> 10:14.191
Let's just sit
right here.

10:14.259 --> 10:15.526
Now the first thing
you have to do,

10:15.594 --> 10:18.129
is you have to
take a deep breath.

10:18.197 --> 10:20.331
And then...

10:20.399 --> 10:21.832
blow it out slow.

10:21.900 --> 10:23.601
Here it comes. Here it comes.
Here it comes.

10:23.669 --> 10:25.069
It's getting bigger
and bigger and bigger

10:25.137 --> 10:27.672
and bigger and bigger
and bigger and bigger...

10:27.740 --> 10:29.407
There you go.

10:33.012 --> 10:35.381
Wow. This is
an amazing-looking creature.

10:35.448 --> 10:37.149
Think you could draw
a picture of it for me?

10:37.217 --> 10:38.617
Okay.

10:38.685 --> 10:40.419
Thank you.

10:43.723 --> 10:45.858
How did you do that?

10:45.925 --> 10:47.926
I've had a little experience

10:47.994 --> 10:51.797
raising a equally spirited
one of my own.

10:51.865 --> 10:53.233
She just--
she never stops.

10:53.300 --> 10:54.601
She wakes me up
at 4:00 in the morning

10:54.668 --> 10:56.770
to tell me she discovered
a new prime number.

10:56.837 --> 10:59.540
Well, as they say, the apple
doesn't fall far from the tree.

10:59.607 --> 11:01.475
Didn't you once take apart
your family's Volkswagen

11:01.542 --> 11:04.144
and make an air cannon
or something?

11:04.212 --> 11:06.313
It was a Nissan.

11:06.381 --> 11:09.082
Careful, careful.
That, uh--

11:09.150 --> 11:10.484
that could be dangerous.

11:10.552 --> 11:12.052
More dangerous
than an air cannon?

11:12.120 --> 11:14.488
Yeah, quite possibly.

11:14.556 --> 11:15.890
Gary, do me a favor.

11:15.957 --> 11:17.791
Try to keep your eyes
in the real world, please?

11:17.859 --> 11:20.494
No. I don't like only being
able to see the real world.

11:20.562 --> 11:22.230
It's boring.
I hate it here.

11:22.297 --> 11:24.532
Yeah, well, you know,
this place reminds me

11:24.599 --> 11:27.235
of when my parents used
to send me to summer camp.

11:27.303 --> 11:28.703
I hated it as well.

11:28.771 --> 11:30.906
I couldn't sleep
without the traffic noises,

11:30.973 --> 11:34.310
but after a while, you learn
to appreciate a place like this.

11:34.377 --> 11:36.279
Smell that.
You smell that country air?

11:36.346 --> 11:40.483
Oh. Bees.
Oh, no.

11:40.551 --> 11:41.584
- Gary, come on, back up.
- I don't like bees, Bill.

11:41.652 --> 11:42.853
They have evil intent.

11:42.920 --> 11:44.287
Gary, wait, wait, wait.
Come back.

11:44.355 --> 11:46.523
- Calm down, son.
- Get off! Get off!

11:46.591 --> 11:48.058
Don't let them sting you.

11:56.234 --> 11:57.701
Oh...

11:57.768 --> 11:59.569
You can speak bee.
Basically.

11:59.637 --> 12:00.803
Huh.

12:00.871 --> 12:02.372
You must be
Skylar's friends.

12:02.439 --> 12:05.008
Um, Agent Harken?
Gary?

12:05.076 --> 12:07.644
No. Agent Bell.
I'm an Agent, too.

12:07.712 --> 12:09.012
Claude.
I'm the, uh, founder

12:09.080 --> 12:10.547
of this colony
for people like us.

12:10.615 --> 12:12.249
You're the guy I need to talk
to--I've got some questions

12:12.317 --> 12:13.750
about security arrangements
around here.

12:13.818 --> 12:16.653
We all get along pretty well.
We've never had any incidents.

12:16.721 --> 12:17.955
I doubt we'll have any now.

12:18.022 --> 12:19.423
You always want to prepare
for the worst

12:19.490 --> 12:20.824
and hope for the best, right?

12:20.892 --> 12:22.325
Oh, you're the founder,

12:22.393 --> 12:24.928
so it's your fault
that there's no signals here.

12:27.498 --> 12:29.665
Gary can read
electromagnetic communication,

12:29.733 --> 12:32.569
so he gets a little cranky
in dead zones like this--

12:32.636 --> 12:34.037
Bill!
I'm not cranky.

12:34.104 --> 12:35.438
You're the cranky--
you're always cranky.

12:35.506 --> 12:36.606
Yeah.

12:36.674 --> 12:38.308
It's not exactly dead
around here.

12:38.375 --> 12:42.245
Nature is crawling with signals,
if you're open to them.

12:42.313 --> 12:44.314
Excuse me.

12:46.117 --> 12:47.183
Okay.

12:49.319 --> 12:51.588
This is amazing.

12:51.656 --> 12:55.525
She's actually hand-drawing
algorithmic fractals.

12:55.593 --> 12:58.162
Yeah, she's bored
with those.

12:58.229 --> 13:00.697
She's moved on
to complex plane multibrots.

13:00.765 --> 13:04.334
It's like having your own
little computer running around.

13:04.402 --> 13:06.870
At least a computer
comes with a manual

13:06.937 --> 13:08.505
and an "off" switch.

13:08.572 --> 13:11.474
Well, it's not easy
raising an Alpha.

13:13.711 --> 13:16.146
That's why we're here--

13:16.214 --> 13:18.481
it takes a village
and all that crap.

13:21.018 --> 13:24.053
Something is draining
the battery.

13:24.121 --> 13:25.655
Could be a design flaw.

13:27.458 --> 13:30.727
- Dinner, dinner!
- Hey--

13:30.795 --> 13:32.562
Thanks, Claude.

13:32.630 --> 13:34.631
Claude...

13:34.699 --> 13:37.467
Skylar's mentioned you.
I'm Dr. Lee Rosen.

13:37.535 --> 13:39.169
I know who you are.

13:42.039 --> 13:44.241
What's that?

13:44.309 --> 13:45.676
Good question.

13:50.248 --> 13:54.585
I guess I'll be seeing you
at dinner.

14:00.425 --> 14:03.794
- Uh, something I said?
- Actually, yes.

14:03.862 --> 14:05.729
That stunt you pulled letting
the world know about Alphas

14:05.796 --> 14:09.799
didn't make you
any friends here.

14:09.867 --> 14:12.401
Dinner!
Come on, mommy, let's go!

14:12.469 --> 14:13.636
Dinner!

14:13.704 --> 14:14.837
You can leave it.
It's safe here.

14:14.905 --> 14:17.206
No, I-I prefer
to keep it with me.

14:17.273 --> 14:19.107
Wow.

14:19.175 --> 14:22.043
You should see a shrink
about those trust issues.

14:24.479 --> 14:25.913
Gary, where are you going?
What are you doing?

14:25.981 --> 14:27.482
I'm going back
to the office!

14:27.550 --> 14:29.050
Bill, I don't have
my things.

14:29.118 --> 14:32.086
I don't have my pajamas or my
mouth guard for the bruxism.

14:32.154 --> 14:33.554
- Gary, listen to me.
- I can't sleep

14:33.622 --> 14:35.056
without my signals.
Gary, this is part of the job.

14:35.123 --> 14:37.291
We have to be on the lookout
for any outside communication,

14:37.359 --> 14:38.626
anybody trying--
Oh, Bill, I told you-

14:38.694 --> 14:40.161
there are no signals.
It's not--

14:40.229 --> 14:42.230
What?

14:42.298 --> 14:45.000
What, someone out there?

14:45.067 --> 14:47.435
No.

14:47.503 --> 14:48.536
Oh.
What-what do you see?

14:48.604 --> 14:49.871
It's a star.

14:49.939 --> 14:51.539
Gary, we're not here
to look for damn stars.

14:51.607 --> 14:52.874
No, it's good.

14:52.942 --> 14:55.076
Some stars, they--
they send out radio waves.

14:55.144 --> 14:56.745
I know that.

14:56.812 --> 14:57.979
- Gary.
- It's a pulsar.

14:58.047 --> 14:59.681
Gary, you're killing me
right now,

14:59.749 --> 15:01.416
you know this, right?
It's pingy.

15:01.484 --> 15:02.417
Whoo-hoo.

15:02.485 --> 15:03.652
Gary.

15:03.719 --> 15:05.387
Gary!

15:05.454 --> 15:06.755
Gary, listen to me.

15:06.822 --> 15:08.523
It's time to eat, okay?

15:08.591 --> 15:10.925
You're late, okay?
You're late to eat, Gary.

15:10.993 --> 15:12.293
Let's--can we--

15:12.361 --> 15:14.162
can we look at stars
another time?

15:14.229 --> 15:16.864
No, Bill, it's not stars.
It's something else.

15:16.932 --> 15:18.766
It's all--
it's all--

15:18.834 --> 15:23.337
it's yellow
and purple and--and red.

15:23.405 --> 15:24.672
And it's--
it's like curtains,

15:24.739 --> 15:26.373
but they're exploding.

15:26.441 --> 15:29.343
Yeah, that sounds like
the Aurora Borealis, Gary.

15:29.411 --> 15:32.513
I've seen that
in Alaska before.

15:32.581 --> 15:34.448
Huh.
It's the whole sky.

15:40.654 --> 15:43.122
Pretty amazing.

15:47.869 --> 15:49.738
You hungry, Gary?
Hey, let's sit right here--

15:49.770 --> 15:51.219
come on--with Hicks.

16:00.125 --> 16:02.660
I could've killed them both.

16:03.174 --> 16:05.275
Don't sneak up on me
like that.

16:05.342 --> 16:06.876
It's what I do.

16:06.944 --> 16:10.013
You're so quiet, we should tie
a frickin' bell on you.

16:10.081 --> 16:11.849
Parish sent us here
to observe.

16:11.916 --> 16:13.750
No one's around--let's just go
and grab the machine.

16:13.818 --> 16:17.154
If we go for it now,
they'll know it's valuable.

16:17.222 --> 16:19.190
We only move if they figure out
what it does.

16:23.897 --> 16:26.738
What the hell is this?

16:26.740 --> 16:29.274
See, uh,
it's a green algae.

16:29.342 --> 16:30.843
Apparently they grow
their own food.

16:30.911 --> 16:32.511
Really?

16:32.579 --> 16:34.313
Yep. Eat up.

16:34.381 --> 16:35.648
Gary, what's the deal?

16:35.716 --> 16:37.583
I thought we had
radio silence out here.

16:37.651 --> 16:39.685
Oh, yeah. No.
I-I was wrong.

16:39.753 --> 16:41.321
There are signals everywhere.

16:41.388 --> 16:43.356
I just--I wasn't focusing
hard enough,

16:43.424 --> 16:44.858
'cause even the trees
have signals,

16:44.925 --> 16:46.393
and the rocks have signals.

16:46.460 --> 16:49.696
It's all--it's wavelengths,
but it's smaller.

16:49.764 --> 16:51.064
It's like--
even this food.

16:51.132 --> 16:53.199
This food has a signal.

16:53.267 --> 16:54.601
It's go--
it sounds like,

16:54.669 --> 16:57.837
Aw-wa, ba-wawawawa, ba-wawawa--

16:57.905 --> 16:59.878
Yeah, that means
"don't eat me."

16:59.879 --> 17:01.112
That's what this means.

17:01.180 --> 17:03.114
- What else is there?
- 'Cause of the color.

17:03.182 --> 17:05.150
No dessert until you
clear your plate, Digit.

17:07.953 --> 17:09.820
Didge.

17:09.887 --> 17:11.856
Look at you,
all domestic.

17:11.923 --> 17:14.657
You even lasered off
all your tattoos.

17:14.726 --> 17:17.560
Or was that just to make it
harder for the FBI to spot you?

17:17.628 --> 17:18.494
Come on, let's go.

17:21.800 --> 17:23.534
Rebel...

17:23.602 --> 17:24.835
Mom.

17:24.903 --> 17:26.603
Rebel...

17:26.671 --> 17:27.904
Mom.

17:27.972 --> 17:29.239
I thought this was a place

17:29.307 --> 17:31.341
where Alphas could be free
to be themselves.

17:31.409 --> 17:33.243
Not me.
I'm here for Zoe.

17:33.311 --> 17:34.978
So what, you can't be
yourself and her mom

17:35.046 --> 17:37.047
all at the same time?

17:37.115 --> 17:39.783
Well, right now
I'm kind of sucking at both.

17:46.492 --> 17:48.993
Trouble in the Justice League?

17:49.061 --> 17:52.397
They're not exactly thrilled
to have me around.

17:52.465 --> 17:54.132
Maybe I should just
stay here with you.

17:54.200 --> 17:55.600
That's a load of crap.

17:55.668 --> 17:57.836
I saw you.
You were happy.

17:57.903 --> 18:00.372
Made me want to throw up.

18:00.439 --> 18:02.707
Yeah, but I ruined it.

18:02.775 --> 18:07.279
And now when I'm with them,
I just feel alone.

18:07.347 --> 18:08.313
This is delicious.

18:08.381 --> 18:09.648
Honey wine.

18:09.716 --> 18:11.250
You made this?

18:11.317 --> 18:14.119
- The bees do all the work.
- Mmm.

18:14.187 --> 18:15.721
It's human nature
to exploit

18:15.789 --> 18:17.923
the special abilities
of other creatures.

18:17.991 --> 18:19.024
Perhaps.

18:19.092 --> 18:20.526
But it could also be perceived

18:20.593 --> 18:24.296
as two groups working together
for their mutual benefit.

18:24.364 --> 18:27.766
And when one disengages
from that bond,

18:27.834 --> 18:29.534
both suffer.

18:29.602 --> 18:33.004
Have you ever had a brick
thrown through your window?

18:33.072 --> 18:35.773
Have you ever been persecuted
for being who you are?

18:35.841 --> 18:37.075
Claude, I'm sorry,

18:37.143 --> 18:38.577
but Dr. Rosen
has spent his entire career

18:38.645 --> 18:40.645
fighting against exactly
that kind of intolerance--

18:40.713 --> 18:42.214
- Rachel--
- His career?

18:42.281 --> 18:44.883
This is our lives
I'm talking about.

18:44.951 --> 18:47.386
And we did not elect you
to be our spokesman.

18:47.453 --> 18:49.788
You're not one of us.
You never will be.

18:49.856 --> 18:51.123
You're just an outsider
looking in.

18:51.190 --> 18:54.025
Yes, I'll admit it--
I am an outsider.

18:54.093 --> 18:56.361
But let me
ask you this, Claude.

18:56.428 --> 18:58.763
If you knew that your bee
colonies were going to collapse

18:58.831 --> 19:00.565
no matter where
you hide them,

19:00.633 --> 19:02.768
what would you do?

19:02.835 --> 19:05.570
Wouldn't you
try to stop it?

19:15.481 --> 19:17.749
Why'd you come here, huh?

19:17.817 --> 19:20.085
No!
Please, no!

19:27.994 --> 19:30.528
I can kill more than cars.

19:30.596 --> 19:32.330
Hey!

19:34.400 --> 19:36.267
Doc!

19:36.335 --> 19:37.835
Doc, you all right?

19:37.903 --> 19:40.904
Yes, I think so.

19:40.972 --> 19:42.339
Easy, easy, easy.

19:42.406 --> 19:44.073
I got him.

19:46.443 --> 19:48.844
What do you know
about this?

19:48.912 --> 19:50.513
I don't know
what you're talking about.

19:50.580 --> 19:52.314
Put those away!

19:52.382 --> 19:55.517
We don't solve things
with violence around here.

19:55.585 --> 19:57.386
Oh, really?

19:57.454 --> 20:01.190
Perhaps you should tell
your man about that.

20:01.257 --> 20:03.392
I didn't start this, Claude.

20:03.460 --> 20:05.261
The hell you didn't!

20:05.329 --> 20:08.030
You started
the whole damn thing.

20:08.098 --> 20:11.234
My life fell apart
because of you.

20:11.301 --> 20:15.071
My wife left me,
and she took my kids,

20:15.138 --> 20:17.273
all because of you
and your big mouth.

20:22.312 --> 20:25.047
Do you have a name?

20:25.115 --> 20:28.984
- Gower.
- Mr. Gower...

20:29.052 --> 20:31.019
I opened my big mouth

20:31.087 --> 20:33.655
because it was
absolutely necessary.

20:33.723 --> 20:35.390
If you'll just
let me explain--

20:35.458 --> 20:37.792
Gower!

20:37.860 --> 20:39.727
Go home.

20:45.234 --> 20:46.367
Claude--

20:46.435 --> 20:47.936
You can
spend the night here,

20:48.003 --> 20:50.538
but I want you gone
by morning.

20:54.844 --> 20:55.978
Come on.

20:56.046 --> 20:57.580
Let's get back
to our homes.

21:17.483 --> 21:20.084
There gonna be some way
to repair this?

21:20.152 --> 21:22.187
Well, maybe
if you stop touching it.

21:22.254 --> 21:23.188
Ugh.

21:23.255 --> 21:26.924
Gower smashed this one up.

21:26.992 --> 21:28.760
I mean, we replaced
the circuit boards.

21:34.734 --> 21:36.067
Hey, do you see that?

21:46.380 --> 21:48.647
Sneaky-ass,
clever bastards.

21:48.715 --> 21:50.983
What?
W-what have you found?

21:51.051 --> 21:52.919
Control circuits.

21:52.986 --> 21:55.621
Nano-processors embedded
in the wires themselves.

21:55.689 --> 21:58.324
Idiots installed it
all backwards.

21:58.392 --> 22:01.194
Yeah, this photostim has
definitely been tampered with.

22:01.262 --> 22:02.429
Is there any way
to determine

22:02.496 --> 22:04.030
what exactly
has been done to it?

22:04.098 --> 22:07.901
- It's gonna take some time.
- We don't have time, Skylar.

22:07.969 --> 22:09.903
Claude wanted us out of here
first thing this morning.

22:09.971 --> 22:12.606
Lucky you.

22:12.674 --> 22:15.610
Hey, you know, you and Zoe
can come with us.

22:15.678 --> 22:17.211
Actually,
that's a great idea.

22:17.279 --> 22:20.649
No. I brought Zoe here
to be around kids like her.

22:20.716 --> 22:23.252
Every morning I wake up
and wish I could leave.

22:23.319 --> 22:25.921
It was so much easier
when I was alone.

22:25.988 --> 22:27.589
Hey, Zoe.

22:27.656 --> 22:29.824
Zoe.

22:32.394 --> 22:34.262
God!
Mother of the frickin' year.

22:34.330 --> 22:35.797
Digit!

22:35.865 --> 22:37.231
Digit?
Skylar.

22:37.299 --> 22:39.033
Oh!

22:39.101 --> 22:40.301
Ugh!

22:40.369 --> 22:41.803
- Rachel, turn that thing off.
- Yeah, okay.

22:41.870 --> 22:43.471
It's got its own
internal power source.

22:43.539 --> 22:44.606
Maybe if I reconnect it--

22:47.176 --> 22:48.277
Rachel!

22:48.344 --> 22:51.180
Bill!

23:00.290 --> 23:03.559
- Oh, my God, what happened?
- She's having a seizure, Bill.

23:03.627 --> 23:06.395
Rachel, stay with me.
Stay with me.

23:06.463 --> 23:08.130
Dr. Rosen...

23:08.198 --> 23:09.498
Where are you?

23:09.566 --> 23:10.900
I can't see you.

23:10.968 --> 23:12.769
I'm right here.

23:17.641 --> 23:21.145
Zoe?

23:21.212 --> 23:22.780
Digit.

23:22.847 --> 23:24.815
Skylar.

23:24.883 --> 23:26.884
Gary, have you seen my kid?

23:26.952 --> 23:29.686
No, but, Skylar, I'm looking
for something too.

23:29.754 --> 23:32.956
I want to get a cabin,
but I want one with carpet.

23:33.024 --> 23:34.858
Everything here's made of wood,
and I like carpet,

23:34.926 --> 23:36.960
'cause it's all--
it's squishy beneath my toes.

23:37.028 --> 23:39.963
I don't have time for this.

23:40.031 --> 23:42.099
Zoe?

23:42.166 --> 23:44.234
- Aah!
- How did that machine do that?

23:44.302 --> 23:46.970
It's as if that--
that instrument, whatever it is,

23:47.038 --> 23:49.473
has amplified
her Alpha ability.

23:49.540 --> 23:51.408
So...it's like
what happened

23:51.476 --> 23:54.378
to that coma kid
in the hospital, right?

23:54.445 --> 23:57.648
Yes, but whatever adjustment
Skylar made to that thing

23:57.716 --> 23:59.783
has increased its potency.

23:59.851 --> 24:02.186
Rachel, Rachel,
what you're experiencing

24:02.254 --> 24:04.422
is an intensification
of your own ability,

24:04.490 --> 24:06.491
which means
you can probably control it.

24:06.559 --> 24:07.926
Just focus,
go through your protocols.

24:07.994 --> 24:09.895
You can control this.

24:15.634 --> 24:17.468
Zoe?

24:50.368 --> 24:51.635
Zoe!

24:54.338 --> 24:56.673
Didge?

24:56.741 --> 25:00.710
I didn't mean it.

25:00.778 --> 25:01.978
Didge?

25:09.387 --> 25:11.956
Come back.

25:12.023 --> 25:14.659
Zoe!

25:14.726 --> 25:16.294
Zoe!

25:31.677 --> 25:33.544
Oh, didn't mean to scare you.

25:33.612 --> 25:35.913
So don't sneak up on people
in the middle of the woods.

25:38.650 --> 25:39.684
Who are you?

25:39.752 --> 25:41.486
We want that machine
you fixed.

25:44.022 --> 25:45.756
It's not mine to give.

25:45.824 --> 25:48.559
Yeah, well,
it's not the Doc's either.

25:48.627 --> 25:51.362
See, he stole it.
We want it back.

26:05.381 --> 26:06.448
- You okay?
- Yeah.

26:06.516 --> 26:08.050
- You sure?
- Yeah, fine.

26:08.117 --> 26:09.184
- Here, Rache.
- I'm okay.

26:09.252 --> 26:10.485
Just get this off of me.

26:10.553 --> 26:12.254
I can't breathe, okay?
Just get it off of me.

26:12.322 --> 26:14.590
- Shh, shh.
- Okay, just--I can't breathe.

26:14.658 --> 26:17.093
Oh.
Rachel, what's wrong?

26:17.160 --> 26:18.494
Oh, you look like
one of the faces

26:18.562 --> 26:20.297
from my expressions chart--

26:20.364 --> 26:21.865
j-joyless.

26:21.933 --> 26:24.101
Rachel's sick, okay?
We're gonna take her home,

26:24.168 --> 26:26.170
as soon as Dr. Rosen gets back
with that photostim.

26:26.237 --> 26:28.539
Oh, okay, drive safe...
and really fast.

26:28.607 --> 26:30.207
I'm gonna go and air out
my cabin.

26:30.275 --> 26:31.509
- What?
- Gary, you--

26:31.576 --> 26:33.144
your cabin?

26:33.211 --> 26:35.613
Yeah.
Yeah, number 33.

26:35.681 --> 26:37.415
Claude said
that I could live here.

26:37.483 --> 26:39.383
And, Nina, you can take
your office back,

26:39.451 --> 26:41.586
'cause I-I don't need
my man cave anymore.

26:41.653 --> 26:43.187
Gary, you're not staying.
Let's go. Get in the van.

26:43.255 --> 26:44.922
- No, I am staying.
- Shh! Stop talking so loud!

26:44.990 --> 26:46.223
I make up my own mind.
I make my decisions.

26:46.291 --> 26:48.058
Gary, there's no
Thai food here,

26:48.126 --> 26:50.895
no Chinese, no take-out,
nothing.

26:50.962 --> 26:52.229
Come on.

26:52.297 --> 26:55.533
No, you're--
you're trying to trick me.

26:55.601 --> 26:59.704
I told you,
I-I'm not leaving!

27:14.186 --> 27:16.654
Oh, God.

27:18.723 --> 27:19.990
Gary!

27:20.058 --> 27:22.359
Gary, have you seen
Skylar anywhere?

27:22.427 --> 27:23.827
- Oh. Yeah, yeah.
- Where?

27:23.895 --> 27:26.063
She went into the trees.
She was looking for Zoe.

27:26.130 --> 27:27.698
I was listening to the sun.

27:27.766 --> 27:29.200
Yeah, well, if you see her,
tell her I'm looking for her.

27:29.267 --> 27:31.769
Yeah, in the--okay.

27:38.643 --> 27:40.344
Where is she?

27:40.411 --> 27:43.346
That's not how this
is gonna work.

27:43.414 --> 27:46.083
90,000 volts--
that's how it's gonna work.

27:46.150 --> 27:48.785
Where is she?

27:50.288 --> 27:52.122
Hey, Doc.

27:54.659 --> 27:57.728
Long time no see.
You're looking good.

27:57.795 --> 27:59.763
Skylar, please don't give
Mr. Scipio that instrument.

27:59.831 --> 28:02.165
He can't be trusted.
He works for Stanton Parish.

28:02.233 --> 28:03.733
They don't care who they hurt!

28:03.801 --> 28:05.235
Come on, Doc, that any way
to talk about an old friend?

28:05.303 --> 28:06.703
We used to have something.

28:06.771 --> 28:08.839
- He has Zoe.
- What?

28:08.906 --> 28:11.408
Lee, you are the reason
why he's here.

28:11.476 --> 28:12.709
We were safe--

28:15.980 --> 28:17.314
Aah!

28:23.221 --> 28:25.755
Doc, come on,
I'm taking that bag.

28:31.362 --> 28:33.196
Why did you do that?
How are we gonna find her now?

28:33.264 --> 28:35.231
We'll find her, I promise.
We have to get out of here!

28:35.299 --> 28:37.600
Go! Go!

28:37.668 --> 28:39.502
We have to get to the van!

28:48.277 --> 28:51.779
Rachel, let us know
when you hear something.

28:51.847 --> 28:53.247
Stop, stop!

28:53.315 --> 28:54.415
Stop the car!

28:54.483 --> 28:57.151
Just let me--
just let me hear, okay?

28:57.219 --> 28:59.687
- What, Rachel?
- Let me just listen!

29:03.192 --> 29:05.960
I hear a child,
breathing hard.

29:06.028 --> 29:08.930
She's scared.
There's somebody with her.

29:08.997 --> 29:10.498
They're indoors.

29:10.566 --> 29:11.932
All right, how far?
Where?

29:12.000 --> 29:14.735
1/4 mile, that way.

29:14.803 --> 29:17.038
Skylar, wait, wait.
It's too dangerous.

29:17.106 --> 29:18.239
- No.
- She'll be fine.

29:18.307 --> 29:20.575
- It's my daughter.
- Skylar!

29:20.643 --> 29:22.444
Skylar! Skylar!

29:22.511 --> 29:23.712
Aah!

29:45.903 --> 29:49.072
Want to do your thing?

29:49.140 --> 29:50.840
Want to let them know
we're coming?

29:50.908 --> 29:53.242
I don't think so.

29:58.181 --> 30:01.283
Hey, want to come
do your thing?

30:01.351 --> 30:03.485
Over on this side.

30:03.553 --> 30:05.988
That open window
right up there.

30:06.056 --> 30:08.056
It's all you, baby.
Yeah.

31:29.221 --> 31:30.988
Do you smell that?

31:31.056 --> 31:33.124
- What?
- Smell what?

31:33.192 --> 31:34.192
It's a fire.

31:34.260 --> 31:36.595
The forest is burning.

31:36.662 --> 31:38.230
It's heading east,
towards the camp.

31:38.298 --> 31:40.132
- That's over a mile away.
- Get in.

31:40.200 --> 31:41.400
Move.

32:25.410 --> 32:28.345
- Look out!
- Run, Zoe!

32:28.413 --> 32:30.547
Aah!

32:33.351 --> 32:36.186
Hey! Hey!

32:36.253 --> 32:38.221
Let me go!

32:38.288 --> 32:39.922
Stand still!

32:39.990 --> 32:41.223
Let me go!

32:41.291 --> 32:42.424
Come here!
Stop!

33:12.457 --> 33:15.292
Look, all we want is the kid.

33:15.360 --> 33:18.162
So let me out
and give me the machine.

33:18.229 --> 33:20.230
Fair trade.
Can't do it, sweetheart.

33:27.173 --> 33:28.540
You're Hicks, right?

33:28.607 --> 33:30.775
My sister told me
about you.

33:30.843 --> 33:33.411
She said she kicked your ass
at Highland Mills.

33:33.479 --> 33:34.779
That's not quite
how I remember it.

33:34.847 --> 33:36.981
Oh, yeah?
Well, you'll remember this.

33:47.193 --> 33:49.661
- You okay?
- Do I look okay?

33:49.728 --> 33:52.263
Get me up.

33:52.331 --> 33:54.064
Where is she?
Where's Zoe?

33:54.132 --> 33:55.566
- Uh, she--
- Where is she?

33:55.634 --> 33:57.635
She's that--
she went that way.

33:57.702 --> 33:59.336
Come on, go, go, go, go.

34:01.506 --> 34:04.107
Zoe!

34:04.175 --> 34:05.442
Mommy's here.

34:09.646 --> 34:12.715
Mommy!

34:14.083 --> 34:16.085
Easy, easy.

34:16.152 --> 34:17.453
Good. You found her.
Come on!

34:17.521 --> 34:18.955
Let's go! Come on!
Okay.

34:19.023 --> 34:20.523
We got to get out of here,
now, now!

34:20.591 --> 34:21.725
All right.

34:27.532 --> 34:29.799
You should've played nice.

34:33.304 --> 34:36.072
No, no, no.
Get back.

34:36.141 --> 34:37.641
Back, back!
Go, go, go!

34:37.708 --> 34:39.243
It's okay.

34:40.745 --> 34:42.911
- Easy, easy, easy.
- Don't worry, honey.

34:42.980 --> 34:45.214
Don't worry.

34:52.156 --> 34:55.658
There's no way we're gonna
make it out of here!

34:55.726 --> 34:57.693
Zoe, you stay
with Hicks, okay?

34:57.761 --> 35:00.163
I got her.

35:04.067 --> 35:07.003
I can fix this.

35:11.508 --> 35:13.108
Everybody, come on!
Hurry up!

35:13.176 --> 35:14.209
Let's go! Move!

35:14.277 --> 35:15.577
Let's keep moving here!

35:20.215 --> 35:22.083
What are you still doing here?

35:22.150 --> 35:23.584
I'm trying to help.

35:23.652 --> 35:26.086
Dr. Rosen!

35:26.153 --> 35:27.654
- Gary!
- Dr. Rosen.

35:27.722 --> 35:29.389
My eyes are all red.
I can't see.

35:29.457 --> 35:30.790
- Go, get in the car.
- Come on, come on.

35:30.858 --> 35:31.858
I'm the shotgun.

35:31.926 --> 35:34.728
Just get in the car, okay?

35:34.795 --> 35:37.530
Gower, go, I've got her.
I've got her.

35:37.598 --> 35:39.966
Here you go.

35:43.671 --> 35:45.138
Claude, what can I do?

35:45.206 --> 35:46.640
Haven't you done enough?

35:51.146 --> 35:52.380
I need that canister.

35:52.447 --> 35:53.447
Here you go.

35:53.515 --> 35:55.884
Okay, give me the hose.

35:55.952 --> 35:57.852
All right.
Hurry.

36:01.157 --> 36:02.224
Let me help.

36:02.292 --> 36:04.794
Okay.
Here, right there.

36:04.862 --> 36:07.463
You lost
213ccs of blood.

36:07.531 --> 36:11.501
That's 7.223868 fluid ounces.

36:11.569 --> 36:12.869
I rounded.

36:12.937 --> 36:15.171
Yeah, I'm gonna take
your word for it, kid.

36:15.239 --> 36:16.506
Take the washers.

36:16.573 --> 36:18.341
- I got 'em, here.
- Okay.

36:18.409 --> 36:20.476
What else?

36:20.544 --> 36:22.612
Make sure
that connection's tight.

36:22.680 --> 36:23.847
Will it work?

36:23.914 --> 36:26.883
Do you know my mommy?

36:37.728 --> 36:38.862
Zoe, come here.

36:38.929 --> 36:40.397
Come on, get out of here.

36:40.464 --> 36:42.031
- What about you?
- I'll be fine. Just go.

36:42.099 --> 36:44.233
- Thank you!
- Go!

36:47.004 --> 36:50.873
Hicks. Hicks!

36:50.941 --> 36:52.442
Come on.

36:55.779 --> 36:58.781
Skylar!

36:58.849 --> 37:00.850
Where's Skylar?
They got out.

37:00.918 --> 37:03.052
Let's get out of here.

37:25.108 --> 37:26.208
Oh, he's hurt.

37:26.275 --> 37:28.510
He's hurt.
Are you okay?

37:28.578 --> 37:30.545
Yeah, yeah.
I stopped bleeding. I'm fine.

37:30.613 --> 37:32.280
Ah, Doc, he's bleeding.

37:32.347 --> 37:34.983
We stopped it.
What happened?

37:35.051 --> 37:37.352
We have to get him
to a hospital.

37:37.420 --> 37:40.021
I'll drive.

37:40.089 --> 37:42.424
A wildfire that broke out
earlier today

37:42.491 --> 37:45.760
near White Mountain National
Forest is reportedly contained,

37:45.828 --> 37:47.896
although a code orange
air-quality alert

37:47.963 --> 37:50.398
remains in effect.

37:50.466 --> 37:53.101
- What are you drawing there?
- A picture of us.

37:58.607 --> 38:01.142
You're a pretty cool kid,
you know that?

38:01.210 --> 38:02.377
I know.

38:06.949 --> 38:09.318
Where's the red one?
This part needs to be red.

38:09.385 --> 38:11.453
Maybe it fell.

38:18.561 --> 38:19.795
Thank you.

38:19.862 --> 38:23.932
They roll everywhere.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.134
She is very talented.

38:28.705 --> 38:31.273
Hitting on a single mom
via her kid--

38:31.341 --> 38:32.541
it's kind of creepy.

38:32.609 --> 38:35.677
I'm not hitting on you,
Ms. Adams.

38:35.745 --> 38:39.181
You're far too young for me.

38:39.249 --> 38:41.984
I'm bringing you an offer.

38:42.052 --> 38:43.653
A child like Zoe--she needs
an environment

38:43.720 --> 38:46.589
that she can thrive in,
as do you.

38:46.657 --> 38:47.924
Who are you?

38:47.991 --> 38:49.993
I'm Stanton Parish.

38:57.101 --> 39:00.470
I believe you met some
of my colleagues recently.

39:00.538 --> 39:02.739
I apologize
for their behavior.

39:02.807 --> 39:04.474
They have
the unfortunate tendency

39:04.542 --> 39:07.311
to get carried away.

39:07.378 --> 39:09.079
What do you want?

39:09.147 --> 39:11.182
To give you
an opportunity...

39:11.250 --> 39:14.252
help make the world
a better place.

39:14.320 --> 39:16.154
Isn't that what every mother
wants for her child?

39:39.009 --> 39:41.977
- Hey.
- Hey.

39:42.044 --> 39:45.914
Heard you had
a rough trip.

39:45.981 --> 39:48.716
My whole world opened up.

39:48.784 --> 39:51.852
I mean, my senses...

39:51.920 --> 39:54.088
It's just--they got bigger
than ever before.

39:55.958 --> 39:59.093
Dr. Rosen doesn't know
if I'll ever...

39:59.161 --> 40:00.995
go back to the way I was.

40:03.965 --> 40:06.033
I would've brought you
flowers, but...

40:06.101 --> 40:07.234
I know the smell

40:07.302 --> 40:08.802
would bother you, so...

40:11.806 --> 40:13.307
What?

40:15.543 --> 40:17.544
You just...

40:17.612 --> 40:20.179
you get me.

40:20.247 --> 40:21.347
You really do.

40:25.286 --> 40:27.621
It's weird, right?

40:27.688 --> 40:30.624
Like, everything's turned up
so high, but...

40:32.760 --> 40:34.461
I'm still here.

40:36.964 --> 40:38.798
Maybe...

40:57.317 --> 41:01.720
Cam...
You could have been killed.

41:01.788 --> 41:03.022
No.

41:03.089 --> 41:05.324
No.

41:05.392 --> 41:07.392
But if it was a couple inches up
and to the right,

41:07.460 --> 41:08.827
I really might've been
in trouble.

41:14.100 --> 41:15.400
I'm so sorry.

41:15.468 --> 41:17.869
Hey, it's not your fault.

41:17.937 --> 41:19.771
Yeah.
No, I know.

41:19.839 --> 41:21.340
It's just--

41:21.408 --> 41:24.443
Besides, if I play
my cards right,

41:24.511 --> 41:27.113
I just might get
medical leave.

41:27.180 --> 41:28.714
You can nurse me
back to health.

41:32.820 --> 41:35.154
Let me guess.

41:35.222 --> 41:39.326
You told Cley that machine
got burnt up in the fire.

41:39.393 --> 41:42.095
Yes. A tragedy.

41:42.163 --> 41:45.566
He was disappointed.

41:45.633 --> 41:47.968
One of these days, Doc,

41:48.036 --> 41:50.070
crap is gonna come back
and bite you in the ass.

41:50.138 --> 41:51.204
You know that, right?

41:53.641 --> 41:55.175
What's on your mind, Bill?

41:55.243 --> 41:57.244
Scipio knew that
we were gonna be there.

41:57.312 --> 41:58.579
I know.

41:58.646 --> 42:02.916
Someone close to us
is working with Parish.

42:04.819 --> 42:07.655
Bill, I want you
to vet everyone.

42:07.722 --> 42:10.591
Cley's office,
the D.O.D. staff,

42:10.658 --> 42:14.294
families, friends, everyone,
even Kat.

42:14.362 --> 42:16.696
All right, I'll bring Hicks
and Gary up to speed.

42:16.764 --> 42:18.064
No.

42:18.132 --> 42:21.601
They don't need to know.

42:21.669 --> 42:24.837
This is just between you
and me.

42:24.905 --> 42:27.073
Find this person, Bill.

42:27.140 --> 42:29.876
And when we do?

42:29.944 --> 42:32.278
Just find him.
