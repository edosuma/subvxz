<i>[man narrating]
It's quite a home, isn't it?</i>

00:58.892 --> 01:03.478
<i>15,000 square feet of overpriced art
and big ol' bathtubs.</i>

01:04.772 --> 01:07.641
<i>I know it's ridiculous,
but I love it.</i>

01:08.610 --> 01:09.942
<i>After all, I'm from Texas.</i>

01:10.654 --> 01:12.486
<i>We tend to like things big
down here.</i>

01:14.032 --> 01:15.113
<i>This is my home.</i>

01:16.118 --> 01:18.986
<i>And you probably can't tell
it's broken.</i>

01:20.581 --> 01:22.038
<i>There's a story behind that.</i>

01:22.874 --> 01:25.116
<i>One that begins and ends
with a girl I married.</i>

01:25.752 --> 01:26.742
<i>Debbie Hall.</i>

01:27.629 --> 01:30.622
<i>A girl with a heart so big
that Texas can't even hold it.</i>

01:31.550 --> 01:33.758
<i>So I'm gonna try
to write it all down.</i>

01:34.386 --> 01:36.594
<i>Hopefully make some sense
out of how I got here.</i>

01:37.264 --> 01:39.221
<i>Problem is,
I've never written anything.</i>

01:40.309 --> 01:43.427
<i>I'm not an author.
I'm an art dealer.</i>

03:47.227 --> 03:48.217
Hello?

03:56.278 --> 03:57.268
Julio?

04:02.784 --> 04:03.774
Hello?

04:15.172 --> 04:16.629
[sighs]

04:17.966 --> 04:19.423
You must be Mr. Hall.

04:19.801 --> 04:21.793
No. No, no, no. Just call me Ron.

04:21.887 --> 04:24.755
Okay, Ron.
I'm Willow, Julio's assistant.

04:24.848 --> 04:26.089
Your drive up okay?

04:26.558 --> 04:28.720
- Yeah, drive out was fine.
- Good.

04:28.810 --> 04:30.847
So, Julio tells me you're an author.

04:31.772 --> 04:33.513
- Oh, he did, did he?
- Yeah.

04:33.607 --> 04:34.438
Oh.

04:34.524 --> 04:35.810
So what kind of book
are you writing?

04:36.568 --> 04:37.809
That's a good question.

04:38.487 --> 04:39.773
Is it a true story?

04:40.280 --> 04:41.816
[exhales]

04:42.073 --> 04:43.439
- Yeah, very.
- [phone ringing]

04:44.409 --> 04:45.274
Uh, I have to get that.

04:53.585 --> 04:55.451
[church bell ringing]

05:14.731 --> 05:17.940
[ringing continues]

05:18.026 --> 05:19.392
It's revival season.

05:21.988 --> 05:23.479
You see that path over there?

05:27.369 --> 05:29.156
[ringing continues, stops]

05:31.915 --> 05:32.826
Thank you.

05:37.170 --> 05:41.039
Well, if you change your mind,
follow the bells.

05:44.719 --> 05:45.550
Where is he?

05:47.347 --> 05:49.304
That was him on the phone.
He's late, as usual.

06:03.864 --> 06:06.652
<i>Ay, ay, ay. [chuckles]</i>

06:06.741 --> 06:09.324
Always forever the perfectionist.

06:10.453 --> 06:12.285
I always thought
this was the saddest painting

06:12.372 --> 06:13.579
I'd ever seen in my life.

06:13.999 --> 06:16.616
[clears throat]
You gave it to me for free,

06:16.710 --> 06:19.077
and now
he's worth a million dollars.

06:19.713 --> 06:20.544
Hmm.

06:23.008 --> 06:24.670
It's not worth a million dollars?

06:25.051 --> 06:26.633
No. No, it is. I just...

06:28.889 --> 06:30.846
Just not sure what a million dollars
is worth anymore.

06:34.394 --> 06:35.384
Are you okay?

06:37.689 --> 06:38.679
Well, I made it here.

06:39.441 --> 06:40.272
Yes, you did.

06:40.984 --> 06:41.815
Ah.

06:42.944 --> 06:44.606
Oh, this. What is this?

06:45.572 --> 06:46.653
[Ron] It ain't a Rembrandt.

06:46.907 --> 06:48.489
[Julio chuckling]

06:55.373 --> 06:58.866
Oh, yes, this is, um, just before

06:58.960 --> 07:01.873
you tricked me
into eating bull's balls.

07:01.963 --> 07:04.580
They're called calf fries,
and I seem to recall you loved them.

07:08.511 --> 07:09.376
Yes, I did.

07:09.471 --> 07:10.928
- Yes, you did.
- Mm-hmm.

07:11.014 --> 07:13.757
[snickers, laughs]

07:14.267 --> 07:17.135
Okay. You can have
any bedroom in the house, okay?

07:17.228 --> 07:18.639
Except the one that I'm sleeping in.

07:18.730 --> 07:21.518
Now get to writing that book
of yours, and I'll leave you alone.

07:40.585 --> 07:41.746
Oh, it's done?

07:42.128 --> 07:44.165
Well... Is that off or crooked?

07:44.255 --> 07:45.291
Uh...

07:45.382 --> 07:47.294
Better. No, down. Yeah.

07:48.426 --> 07:51.134
I still don't know why
it needed restoring, but...

07:53.056 --> 07:53.967
Is it different?

07:55.725 --> 07:58.138
Oh, it seems
like it was better before.

07:59.896 --> 08:00.727
Oh.

08:02.399 --> 08:04.061
Maybe I like the way
time treated it,

08:04.150 --> 08:08.144
like you could see its history
or something.

08:08.238 --> 08:11.447
Well, everything just needs a little
touch up and polish once in a while.

08:11.533 --> 08:12.819
I gotta get out to North Dallas.

08:12.909 --> 08:15.902
I'm supposed to sell a Remington
to a crazy old lady, all right?

08:16.204 --> 08:17.570
- I'll see you at the gala tonight?
- Yeah.

08:17.664 --> 08:19.121
- Kids are coming, right?
- Right.

08:19.916 --> 08:21.703
Don't let them back out, Debbie.
It's important.

08:22.002 --> 08:23.083
I know it's important.

08:23.169 --> 08:25.661
Well, it is, Debbie.

08:30.051 --> 08:31.383
I know.

08:36.099 --> 08:40.934
[applause]

08:41.020 --> 08:43.729
Hey, you all know my definition
of modern art.

08:43.815 --> 08:45.056
You take a canvas,

08:45.150 --> 08:47.312
you throw a little paint on it,
you wipe it off with a rag,

08:47.402 --> 08:49.519
you throw out the canvas,
and you sell the rag.

08:49.612 --> 08:51.319
[laughter]

08:51.406 --> 08:52.817
You know that's true.

08:52.907 --> 08:54.489
<i>- You know that's true.
- [man] It is true.</i>

08:54.868 --> 08:56.359
That's why I only deal
in the classics

08:56.453 --> 08:58.490
and you all have
my telephone number.

08:58.580 --> 08:59.445
[laughter]

08:59.539 --> 09:01.747
I do wanna thank you, though,
for coming out here tonight

09:01.833 --> 09:04.041
to support
Fort Worth Art in Public Places.

09:04.127 --> 09:06.619
This is an important cause
for all of us.

09:06.713 --> 09:09.751
We couldn't do this
without your decency, your kindness,

09:10.008 --> 09:11.499
and, of course, your generosity.

09:11.885 --> 09:14.172
That means I'm gonna ask you
for more donations later.

09:14.262 --> 09:15.093
[laughter]

09:15.180 --> 09:17.888
Thank you for coming down.
Have a good time tonight. Thank you.

09:24.022 --> 09:26.264
- How'd it go?
- Good job, Dad.

09:26.357 --> 09:27.188
Thanks.

09:27.650 --> 09:29.391
- Hey.
- I always say give till it hurts.

09:29.486 --> 09:30.317
Well, that's what I said.

09:30.403 --> 09:32.144
I was trying to say it
like you, give till it hurts.

09:32.238 --> 09:33.149
How are you, dear?

09:34.574 --> 09:37.442
Okay, listen, I want you to tell
everybody how good I was.

09:37.535 --> 09:38.651
You guys have fun.

09:40.580 --> 09:41.570
- [man] Hey.
- [indistinct]

09:45.627 --> 09:46.617
Come on.

09:48.922 --> 09:51.539
It can't be that bad being the
prettiest girl at the ball.

09:51.633 --> 09:52.794
[chuckles]

09:54.761 --> 09:55.592
What's wrong?

09:56.721 --> 09:57.552
Nothing.

10:02.519 --> 10:03.350
What is it?

10:05.563 --> 10:09.307
Dad, this is your life.
It's not mine.

10:11.361 --> 10:13.569
Hey, Ron.
Can I speak to you for a moment?

10:15.115 --> 10:16.947
- Hey, Susie, how are you?
- Hi.

10:17.283 --> 10:18.364
[kisses] Good to see you.

10:23.331 --> 10:24.822
Martin told me about your friend.

10:24.916 --> 10:26.908
[exhales]

10:27.001 --> 10:28.492
Wh... What are...
What are you talking about?

10:28.586 --> 10:30.953
If you don't tell Debbie, I will.

10:47.021 --> 10:49.889
- Nineteen years!
- Yes, we've been married 19 years.

10:49.983 --> 10:52.441
- And?
- And it doesn't mean what it should!

10:55.405 --> 10:57.613
- What does that mean?
- Well, we don't share the same life.

10:57.699 --> 10:59.406
We don't share anything!

10:59.701 --> 11:01.442
- Course we do.
- And you know it. We don't. We...

11:01.911 --> 11:03.027
We haven't been intimate
in two years.

11:05.248 --> 11:06.284
<i>We haven't been intimate
in two years!</i>

11:06.374 --> 11:08.366
No, we haven't slept together
in two years!

11:08.459 --> 11:10.416
We haven't been intimate
in ten years!

11:10.920 --> 11:12.456
We haven't been intimate in ten...

11:12.547 --> 11:14.459
Yeah, so what was I supposed
to do with that?

11:14.549 --> 11:16.882
What were you supposed to do
with that?

11:19.220 --> 11:21.212
<i>What are we supposed to do
with this?</i>

14:11.809 --> 14:12.640
Ronnie.

14:14.937 --> 14:15.927
- Ronnie?
- Mm-hmm?

14:20.318 --> 14:23.527
I'm only gonna ask this once,
so please don't lie to me, okay?

14:24.238 --> 14:25.069
Yeah?

14:28.242 --> 14:31.451
Is there anything else
that you haven't told me?

14:36.709 --> 14:37.745
Painting's a fake.

14:41.464 --> 14:42.671
I didn't have it restored.

14:46.302 --> 14:47.418
I had it copied.

14:50.098 --> 14:51.305
Sold the original.

14:56.437 --> 14:58.599
You gave that to me
for our anniversary.

15:02.777 --> 15:06.191
A dealer offered me a lot of money
for it.

15:07.407 --> 15:08.488
So...

15:12.286 --> 15:13.117
I took it.

15:13.579 --> 15:14.820
Not proud of it, but...

15:19.210 --> 15:21.122
Just trying to be honest,
so, I'm sorry.

15:26.634 --> 15:27.465
Is that all?

15:29.762 --> 15:30.593
Yeah.

15:33.766 --> 15:34.597
Yeah.

15:38.312 --> 15:39.428
What's her number?

16:12.763 --> 16:14.049
[beeps]

16:17.185 --> 16:18.847
[line ringing]

16:21.564 --> 16:22.645
[line picks up]

16:24.484 --> 16:25.315
Hi.

16:27.069 --> 16:29.402
This is Debbie. I'm Ron's wife.

16:30.072 --> 16:33.031
Please don't hang up. Are you there?

16:35.828 --> 16:41.199
I just want you to know that I don't
blame you and I forgive you.

16:41.709 --> 16:45.077
And I hope that you will
find someone who truly loves you

16:45.171 --> 16:47.163
like Ron and I
used to love each other.

16:49.091 --> 16:52.880
If we can find that again, you won't
be hearing from my husband anymore.

16:54.222 --> 16:56.555
Okay. Goodbye.

17:14.325 --> 17:15.361
You can leave.

17:17.619 --> 17:18.576
You can go.

17:23.084 --> 17:23.994
Or...

17:29.799 --> 17:30.664
You choose.

17:40.059 --> 17:41.470
I... I choose you.

17:45.940 --> 17:47.226
[exhales]

17:52.947 --> 17:54.108
[clicks tongue]

18:08.045 --> 18:11.334
<i>[Ron narrating] Somebody once said,
"All men make mistakes,</i>

18:12.049 --> 18:14.507
<i>but married men
find out about them sooner."</i>

18:15.928 --> 18:18.511
<i>Over the next few months,
Debbie and I worked hard</i>

18:18.598 --> 18:20.305
<i>to regain what we had lost.</i>

18:21.642 --> 18:24.259
<i>My greatest failure was betraying
my wife.</i>

18:25.521 --> 18:27.387
<i>But that didn't stop
her big old heart</i>

18:27.481 --> 18:29.222
<i>from granting me a second chance.</i>

18:30.484 --> 18:32.100
<i>Course, she didn't want an apology</i>

18:32.194 --> 18:35.528
<i>that included fur coats
or diamond rings.</i>

18:36.282 --> 18:37.648
<i>It wouldn't be that easy.</i>

18:38.200 --> 18:40.908
<i>She was gonna make me pay
with my hands.</i>

18:43.247 --> 18:44.954
<i>Then it happened again.</i>

18:45.916 --> 18:47.999
I had another dream last night.

18:48.461 --> 18:52.045
Yeah? Was it a good one,
or was it about me?

18:53.049 --> 18:54.039
No.

18:55.426 --> 18:58.965
It was about a poor wise man
who changes the city.

19:02.266 --> 19:03.723
And I saw his face.

19:07.938 --> 19:08.894
Turn here.

19:10.816 --> 19:13.058
[Ron] Here?
Well, where you taking me?

19:13.152 --> 19:14.643
I don't think we wanna go down here.

19:15.363 --> 19:16.194
Hon...

19:18.866 --> 19:24.362
In my dream, I saw beautiful flowers
and trees everywhere.

19:24.955 --> 19:26.867
Can't you just see
that happening here?

19:27.708 --> 19:31.122
Flower boxes.
No trash in the gutters.

19:32.046 --> 19:36.962
Just a peaceful place where
the people here know they matter

19:37.051 --> 19:39.418
as much as the ones
on the other side of that tunnel.

19:39.720 --> 19:41.461
Honey,
we're a little turned around here.

19:42.765 --> 19:43.755
Okay?

19:45.309 --> 19:47.892
- Can you pull over right there?
- I'm gonna back... Huh?

19:47.978 --> 19:49.014
Pull over right there.

19:49.105 --> 19:50.221
- Here?
- Yeah, there.

19:52.066 --> 19:53.147
- Here?
- Right here.

20:06.706 --> 20:08.368
- [engine off]
- What are we doing here?

20:18.759 --> 20:20.000
It'll be fine.

20:21.887 --> 20:23.844
- Maybe I should put the top up?
- Come on.

20:35.025 --> 20:36.436
[man] As I live and breathe.

20:37.361 --> 20:38.272
- Debbie.
- Oh, hi.

20:38.362 --> 20:41.070
- Good to see you again.
- You too, Jim.

20:41.991 --> 20:44.404
And you must be the hubby
she's always talking about.

20:44.869 --> 20:47.077
- I'm Chef Jim.
- Yeah. Ronald.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.618
Well, time's a-wasting. Follow me.
We're about ready to start.

20:50.708 --> 20:51.698
Oh, good.

20:54.587 --> 20:55.577
[Debbie] Hi.

21:00.176 --> 21:01.132
Thank you.

21:01.886 --> 21:04.253
- Oh. I got these.
- [Jim] Thank you.

21:08.726 --> 21:10.558
- You been here before?
- Mm-hmm.

21:11.312 --> 21:14.771
Dropped off some clothes and things
we don't need over the years.

21:15.566 --> 21:16.602
Okay, well...

21:18.068 --> 21:19.934
Now we know why you're dreaming
about the place, right?

21:20.029 --> 21:20.894
Mystery solved.

21:23.574 --> 21:25.440
It looked much different
in my dream.

21:31.332 --> 21:33.244
[Jim] Man,
am I glad you guys showed up.

21:33.334 --> 21:34.950
We need every helping hand
we can get.

21:35.044 --> 21:36.455
You got help right here.

21:37.963 --> 21:38.794
Debbie.

21:40.007 --> 21:41.248
Honey, we can't help.

21:41.842 --> 21:45.802
Sweetie, I got a... I got a sales
call at the office at 6:30.

21:45.888 --> 21:47.675
I gotta drop off contracts
north of town.

21:47.765 --> 21:48.926
No, you don't.

21:50.267 --> 21:51.803
[Jim] My wife wore the pants too,
hubby.

21:51.894 --> 21:54.011
Excuse me, sir. Debbie?

21:54.897 --> 21:57.264
Please? Come in here.

22:08.160 --> 22:08.991
Honey.

22:09.453 --> 22:12.946
This is so nice what you're doing
here, all right? But I gotta...

22:13.040 --> 22:16.875
[water running]

22:16.961 --> 22:21.046
<i>I gotta go to the office and sell
that Calder Eagle tonight.</i>

22:21.131 --> 22:22.212
And you know what I'm gonna do?

22:22.633 --> 22:25.046
I'm gonna write a check
for the place...

22:25.135 --> 22:26.751
- What's this?
- Soap. Use soap.

22:26.846 --> 22:27.802
Uh...

22:28.264 --> 22:30.347
- You may need this.
- No, I don't need that.

22:30.558 --> 22:32.550
I wanna know why these people
who don't have jobs

22:32.643 --> 22:33.975
aren't helping out around here.

22:34.061 --> 22:35.142
They do.

22:36.146 --> 22:38.809
Sweetie, I'll write the check.
You can make out the amount.

22:38.899 --> 22:39.889
Thank you.

22:40.693 --> 22:41.934
There's a brush right there.

22:52.121 --> 22:53.111
[Ron] All right, Jimmy.

22:56.876 --> 22:58.117
I don't like germs.

22:58.210 --> 22:59.701
[clears throat]

22:59.795 --> 23:01.002
I'm gonna do this one time.

23:03.007 --> 23:05.090
Is there any infectious diseases
floating around this place

23:05.175 --> 23:06.006
I should know about?

23:06.093 --> 23:07.129
[chuckles]

23:07.219 --> 23:08.255
Absolutely.

23:09.138 --> 23:10.800
We try to infect them all with love.

23:12.766 --> 23:15.099
- Thank you for the tip.
- [Jimmy chuckles]

23:21.233 --> 23:22.144
Yeah.

23:23.277 --> 23:24.688
[plates clatter]

23:27.531 --> 23:29.488
Infectious diseases?

23:29.992 --> 23:31.574
- What?
- [chuckles] Nothing.

23:35.497 --> 23:37.113
[plate clatters]

23:38.584 --> 23:39.665
[Debbie] Hi, Tiny.

23:40.878 --> 23:42.085
Good to see you again.

23:42.671 --> 23:43.787
Good to see you, ma'am.

23:43.881 --> 23:45.213
Wait. Wait. Here.

23:46.508 --> 23:47.874
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Yeah.

23:48.302 --> 23:49.258
Hi.

23:51.096 --> 23:52.086
I'm Debbie.

23:53.849 --> 23:54.680
What's your name?

23:54.975 --> 23:57.058
I know y'all think
y'all doing us a big favor,

23:57.436 --> 23:58.893
thinking y'all is better than us.

24:00.439 --> 24:01.395
You just remember.

24:01.815 --> 24:03.397
When you miss a couple paychecks

24:03.484 --> 24:05.191
and your wife kick you
out the door...

24:05.945 --> 24:09.609
And just like that,
you'd be homeless too. Just like us.

24:14.578 --> 24:16.160
That how you say "thank you"
down here?

24:19.041 --> 24:20.577
[people gasp]

24:21.001 --> 24:22.617
[shouting, chattering]

24:24.546 --> 24:27.004
I'm gonna kill whoever done it!

24:27.341 --> 24:29.378
Gonna kill whoever stole my shoes!

24:32.179 --> 24:33.169
Hey!

24:33.430 --> 24:35.137
Suicide, stop it!

24:35.224 --> 24:37.386
[Debbie] Hey! Stop it!

24:38.018 --> 24:40.931
Stop it!
There's a little girl right here!

24:41.230 --> 24:42.471
What are you doing?

25:09.550 --> 25:10.461
Ronnie.

25:12.052 --> 25:13.509
We have to talk to him.

25:16.724 --> 25:20.468
Honey, I don't understand
what's going on here. I'm trying.

25:21.020 --> 25:22.761
That's the man from my dream.

25:23.647 --> 25:24.683
That's him.

25:25.607 --> 25:27.644
We're going home. Come on.

25:29.737 --> 25:30.727
Come on.

25:32.489 --> 25:33.730
What's wrong with you?

25:37.786 --> 25:38.697
Seriously?

25:51.467 --> 25:53.959
Mr. Mercedes!

25:54.053 --> 25:55.919
Whoo!

25:56.013 --> 25:59.177
You been looking for me, baby?
'Cause I been looking for you.

25:59.767 --> 26:01.474
I'm looking for somebody
named Suicide.

26:03.062 --> 26:04.394
I can tell you where he is, baby,

26:04.480 --> 26:06.346
but it's gonna cost you
ten presidents.

26:08.358 --> 26:09.314
You know him?

26:09.985 --> 26:10.896
Mm-hmm.

26:11.612 --> 26:12.728
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

26:13.739 --> 26:14.650
Okay.

26:16.658 --> 26:19.196
- No drugs.
- No drugs.

26:20.662 --> 26:22.779
You're close, real close.

26:24.333 --> 26:27.997
[laughing]

26:31.048 --> 26:32.038
[woman] Stupid.

26:37.805 --> 26:39.512
You tried to jack the wrong nigga!

26:39.932 --> 26:41.844
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

26:42.267 --> 26:43.348
Give me my shoes!

26:44.103 --> 26:45.093
What?

26:45.562 --> 26:47.349
What you looking at, huh?

26:47.689 --> 26:49.021
[Ron yelps]

26:49.441 --> 26:50.431
What?

26:51.944 --> 26:53.060
Guy's violent.

26:53.153 --> 26:55.270
Bet he wasn't carrying
a 34-inch baseball bat

26:55.364 --> 26:56.730
when you had him in your dream.

26:56.824 --> 26:59.157
I know, and he chased you
down the street.

26:59.243 --> 27:02.452
- [Ron] That's right.
- Hi, I'm Debbie. What's your name?

27:02.955 --> 27:03.911
Killer.

27:03.997 --> 27:05.704
Hi, Killer, nice to meet you.

27:07.835 --> 27:10.543
You talked to Killer.
That's saying something.

27:10.921 --> 27:12.628
[Ron] Let me understand.
So that's Killer.

27:13.215 --> 27:14.797
The guy who tried to kill me
is Suicide?

27:15.092 --> 27:16.628
Yeah, we got all kinds here.

27:23.851 --> 27:25.012
What about him?

27:27.729 --> 27:30.847
Well, as you know,
he can be dangerous.

27:33.235 --> 27:34.897
That qualify you for hazard pay?

27:36.613 --> 27:37.774
- Me?
- Yeah.

27:37.865 --> 27:40.983
I don't get paid.
I came in the same doors they did.

27:42.077 --> 27:43.443
I'm one of them. I live here.

27:44.163 --> 27:47.702
I used to be the executive chef
of a large hotel chain.

27:48.125 --> 27:50.458
I had a wife. Great home.

27:51.295 --> 27:54.459
One day I got a call that my son
had been hit by a drunk driver.

27:55.674 --> 27:57.461
He was dead
before the ambulance arrived.

27:58.385 --> 27:59.375
And my wife...

28:01.096 --> 28:02.337
Well, she just couldn't take it.

28:02.973 --> 28:04.430
She ended up in a mental hospital.

28:05.475 --> 28:09.515
Meanwhile, I numbed my pain with
liquor and a double dose of drugs.

28:11.023 --> 28:12.104
Sorry, Jim.

28:12.691 --> 28:16.401
Ah, don't be. It led me here.

28:27.039 --> 28:27.870
Hi.

28:31.835 --> 28:32.746
I'm Debbie.

28:33.503 --> 28:37.918
And that's my husband, Ron, back
there, and this is our son, Carson.

28:39.718 --> 28:42.256
- What's your name?
- It's Clara, ma'am.

28:43.597 --> 28:45.008
It's a really pretty name.

28:47.267 --> 28:51.887
Hey, be sure to stop by our beauty
shop area after you're done eating.

28:51.980 --> 28:54.597
We're gonna give makeovers
to all the ladies.

28:56.652 --> 28:59.269
- Thank you, ma'am. I will.
- I hope you will.

29:18.715 --> 29:20.672
It's... one per customer.

29:23.136 --> 29:24.126
Ronnie.

29:29.893 --> 29:30.974
Remember me, right?

29:32.396 --> 29:33.807
Destroyed my car.

29:35.232 --> 29:36.313
I'm Debbie.

29:39.695 --> 29:40.685
What's your name?

29:41.113 --> 29:42.604
You don't need to know my name,

29:43.115 --> 29:45.903
so shut up and put some food
on these here plates.

29:49.955 --> 29:51.571
Well, I'd like to know your name.

29:51.915 --> 29:55.158
You best watch out now, lady.
Get on out of my business!

30:05.762 --> 30:07.094
[mouths words]

30:43.425 --> 30:44.666
You look beautiful.

30:48.305 --> 30:50.422
- Oh.
- Like it?

30:51.475 --> 30:54.013
- Thank you, Miss Debbie.
- Mm-hmm.

30:57.230 --> 30:58.095
You know, I...

30:59.900 --> 31:01.516
I wasn't always homeless.

31:04.946 --> 31:06.153
I had a husband.

31:07.574 --> 31:11.318
He wasn't very nice,
but he gone now.

31:13.246 --> 31:14.407
I had a son.

31:16.541 --> 31:19.124
But they... they took him from me

31:19.461 --> 31:21.874
when I couldn't take care of us
no more.

31:23.382 --> 31:24.589
Oh, sweetheart.

31:26.968 --> 31:31.178
[sobs] I done things
I'm not proud of.

31:33.558 --> 31:35.049
A lot of things.

31:35.936 --> 31:39.304
Oh, Clara, we all have.

31:40.690 --> 31:42.352
We all have, Clara.

31:52.911 --> 31:54.368
You're ruining your makeup.

31:54.996 --> 31:57.204
You worked so hard. I'm sorry.

31:59.501 --> 32:00.537
Gosh, where are my tissues?

32:00.627 --> 32:03.210
You're being so nice to me,
Miss Debbie.

32:05.590 --> 32:06.876
We had fun, didn't we?

32:07.843 --> 32:10.677
We did. I can't believe it.

32:14.182 --> 32:15.263
Oh.

32:18.520 --> 32:19.681
Thank you.

32:22.482 --> 32:23.518
Thank you.

32:48.633 --> 32:49.919
Well, hey, y'all.

32:50.010 --> 32:52.127
[Debbie] Hi, Tommye.
Great to see you.

32:52.220 --> 32:54.212
- It smells good in here.
- Mm-hmm.

32:54.306 --> 32:55.763
- Hey, Mom.
- Hi, sweetheart.

32:56.266 --> 32:58.132
Dad's in the back, playing.

33:42.437 --> 33:44.394
[engine off]

33:45.398 --> 33:47.606
Dollar waiting on a dime.
Where you been?

33:48.652 --> 33:50.439
You ever hear of punctuality?

33:52.239 --> 33:53.946
You ever hear
of not drinking and driving?

33:57.577 --> 33:58.818
What you got against drinking?

34:02.499 --> 34:06.118
How come you never drink...
have never drink with me? Never...

34:06.211 --> 34:08.373
You too proud to drink
with your old man?

34:09.630 --> 34:11.543
It looks like you're doing okay
on your own.

34:12.342 --> 34:15.176
Oh, here we go, huh?
Here we go again.

34:16.471 --> 34:17.552
You know, I'm sick of you...

34:18.389 --> 34:19.926
Sick of you judging me all the time.

34:21.601 --> 34:23.308
- That right?
- That's right.

34:25.772 --> 34:29.014
Come on in, before the chicken
and dumplings get cold.

34:29.109 --> 34:31.976
I'm sick of it.
Did you ever miss a meal?

34:32.696 --> 34:34.402
Did you ever want for anything?

34:34.739 --> 34:38.358
No, 'cause I put a paycheck
on the table every... every week,

34:38.451 --> 34:39.862
from a job I couldn't stand.

34:39.953 --> 34:42.445
- Earl, stop it. Let's eat.
- He started it.

34:42.539 --> 34:44.155
And I'm finishing it. So...

34:44.248 --> 34:47.208
So the both of you sit down
and... and shut up.

34:47.460 --> 34:50.293
Before you do anything else,
I need a refill.

34:50.380 --> 34:52.871
Whiskey and a Coke.
Not too much Coke.

34:52.966 --> 34:56.208
And while you're at it,
pour one for Ronnie here too.

34:56.303 --> 34:57.965
I'll have an iced tea, please.

35:02.017 --> 35:03.383
Are you gonna put your pants on?

35:04.603 --> 35:06.595
Nah. It's just family.

35:07.022 --> 35:09.139
- Hello, Deborah.
- Hi, Earl.

35:10.442 --> 35:12.809
Tommye, the dumplings look perfect.

35:13.236 --> 35:15.523
Gotta save some room
for the angel food cake.

35:15.614 --> 35:17.276
[mock gasp] I will.

35:19.451 --> 35:21.784
Ron, what is this that
Deborah tells me

35:22.162 --> 35:25.405
about, uh, your volunteering
at the mission

35:25.498 --> 35:28.912
and befriending some...
some homeless man?

35:29.586 --> 35:31.452
- It's Debbie who got us down...
- [Earl] What?

35:32.005 --> 35:33.371
Have you lost your mind?

35:34.341 --> 35:38.005
Those places have more germs
than a rest stop toilet seat.

35:38.094 --> 35:41.053
And there's lot of bums there,
looking for handouts

35:41.139 --> 35:43.722
instead of... instead of
using their hands for work.

35:44.517 --> 35:47.134
Bunch of... lazy Negroes.

35:47.228 --> 35:48.139
[Debbie] Earl!

35:48.813 --> 35:51.226
Well, what do you call them?
That's what they're called.

35:51.316 --> 35:52.397
I always call them that.

35:53.360 --> 35:56.774
- Come on, Earl.
- I didn't mean that. I meant...

35:57.697 --> 36:00.064
There's criminals down there.
Bad people.

36:00.784 --> 36:02.150
It's dirty...

36:02.535 --> 36:05.243
[stammers]
Dirty. Disease, everything.

36:05.580 --> 36:06.787
Look. That's...

36:07.666 --> 36:09.828
That's my final word on the subject.

36:10.585 --> 36:11.951
[Debbie clears throat]

36:15.173 --> 36:16.334
Too much Coke.

36:17.759 --> 36:20.217
[swing music playing]

36:22.597 --> 36:23.553
[Ron] Sorry.

36:29.479 --> 36:30.811
- Hey, Ronnie?
- Mmm.

36:31.314 --> 36:33.146
Why don't you go bring him a plate?

36:33.566 --> 36:35.728
- Who?
- Him.

36:36.569 --> 36:39.607
[chuckles] Oh, no, no.
I'm not gonna do that, honey.

36:39.698 --> 36:41.155
He's the man of your dreams,
not mine.

36:41.241 --> 36:43.904
- Come on, please, just take one.
- No, no, no.

36:43.993 --> 36:46.736
- He doesn't like me very much.
- Don't be scared, Ronnie.

36:46.830 --> 36:48.571
You know his name is Suicide.

36:49.374 --> 36:50.364
Please?

36:51.584 --> 36:52.540
Honey.

36:54.546 --> 36:55.411
No.

36:57.424 --> 36:58.631
No. No.

37:13.857 --> 37:16.349
[clears throat] My wife's concerned
you're not eating, so...

37:17.736 --> 37:18.897
Made you a little something here.

37:19.988 --> 37:22.696
Man to man, you'd be doing me
a big favor to just,

37:23.575 --> 37:24.782
you know, have a little something.

37:26.619 --> 37:27.951
You don't have to eat
the whole thing.

37:28.538 --> 37:30.450
Just a few bites. No?

37:32.792 --> 37:33.748
You don't like Italian?

37:35.128 --> 37:37.962
You're walking away, aren't you?
He's walking away.

37:40.258 --> 37:41.214
I tried.

38:00.904 --> 38:01.894
You the CIA?

38:04.449 --> 38:05.280
No.

38:08.912 --> 38:12.155
Can you get control of your woman
and tell her to stop bothering me?

38:16.127 --> 38:16.958
No, I can't.

38:18.171 --> 38:19.878
- What do you want from me, then?
- Nothing.

38:20.757 --> 38:22.168
We don't want anything from you.
We just...

38:23.301 --> 38:24.792
Take it easy on my car over there.

38:25.428 --> 38:26.418
How about that?

38:27.806 --> 38:29.342
When we come around,
you could be nicer.

38:32.644 --> 38:33.600
Little more friendly.

38:36.314 --> 38:37.896
You wanna be my friend?

38:42.529 --> 38:43.360
Uh-huh.

38:47.033 --> 38:49.616
Well, I'm gonna have to think
about that.

38:54.207 --> 38:56.119
I ain't gonna hurt you or nothing.

38:58.002 --> 39:02.121
You and your wife been trying
to be nice to me for some time now.

39:02.715 --> 39:03.922
And I avoided you.

39:11.057 --> 39:12.138
What's your name?

39:13.268 --> 39:14.475
I know it ain't Suicide.

39:26.281 --> 39:29.319
Denver. Name's Denver.

39:36.040 --> 39:36.871
You hungry?

39:40.587 --> 39:42.579
You didn't eat anything in there.
Kitchen's closed.

39:54.225 --> 39:57.218
Before I answer your question
about us being friends...

39:58.438 --> 40:00.054
something I wanna ask you.

40:02.066 --> 40:02.931
Yeah?

40:04.736 --> 40:07.570
Something about white folks
that really bothers me.

40:10.116 --> 40:12.199
I hear when white folks
go fishing...

40:13.912 --> 40:17.280
they do this thing they call
"catch and release."

40:19.834 --> 40:20.745
Yeah.

40:24.422 --> 40:25.833
Well, you know, it's just a sport.

40:28.176 --> 40:29.917
You know?
Sometimes you just fish for fun.

40:31.262 --> 40:32.594
- Fun?
- Mmm.

40:37.018 --> 40:37.849
See...

40:39.228 --> 40:41.766
Where I growed up,
on a plantation...

40:43.650 --> 40:45.232
we'd go out in the morning...

40:46.069 --> 40:47.810
dig us up some worms...

40:48.738 --> 40:50.525
cut us a cane pole...

40:51.282 --> 40:53.649
sit on the riverbank all day.

40:56.287 --> 40:58.620
When we finally caught something
on the line...

40:59.582 --> 41:02.165
we was real proud of what we caught.

41:03.795 --> 41:07.334
We'd take it back home,
show it off...

41:08.216 --> 41:10.378
and share it with all the folk.

41:13.346 --> 41:18.057
See, it bothers me that white folk
go through all of that trouble...

41:19.227 --> 41:23.392
and when they finally got something
on the line, they throw it back.

41:26.526 --> 41:27.357
So...

41:28.194 --> 41:30.857
It occurred to me
that if you is a white man

41:30.947 --> 41:32.779
that is fishing for a friend...

41:33.825 --> 41:36.568
and you're just gonna
catch and release...

41:41.207 --> 41:44.416
then I got no desire
to be your friend.

41:50.341 --> 41:51.548
You understand me?

41:55.471 --> 41:57.758
- You hear me?
- Yeah.

42:01.185 --> 42:02.096
Yeah.

42:05.815 --> 42:06.771
Where you from?

42:10.153 --> 42:11.143
Louisiana.

42:16.617 --> 42:17.528
Got any family?

42:28.004 --> 42:29.791
Never knowed my mama.

42:31.799 --> 42:34.337
I hear she was too young
to care for me.

42:35.720 --> 42:37.461
So I was raised by my grandma.

42:42.310 --> 42:44.176
We called her Big Mama.

42:46.397 --> 42:50.607
<i>She was big sideways,
north or south,</i>

42:51.277 --> 42:52.984
<i>all the way around.</i>

42:53.988 --> 42:55.650

42:56.240 --> 42:58.983

42:59.619 --> 43:01.076
She had a lot of pain.

43:02.413 --> 43:05.656

Her and my cousin Chook.

43:06.375 --> 43:09.243

43:35.655 --> 43:38.739
<i>But I hardly ever saw him

43:51.212 --> 43:53.704
<i>I used to like it
when Big Mama was sleeping.</i>

43:54.674 --> 43:56.506
<i>'Cause that's when she had no pain.</i>

44:00.930 --> 44:03.013
Had a window by my bed.

44:04.892 --> 44:07.555
<i>I'd look up at the stars

The nights was just as black
as molasses.

And the stars glittered
like broken glass in the sun.

<i>Well, whatever she was selling,
I wasn't buying.</i>

Can I help you, son?

57:00.959 --> 57:02.621
You can hear them better
from inside.

57:05.589 --> 57:06.705
I'm good, thank you.

- [chuckles]
- Amazing, isn't it?

58:05.899 --> 58:07.856
How far
a little tender loving care can go?

58:12.322 --> 58:13.187
Yeah.

Hey, there. Any food left?

58:19.538 --> 58:20.619
Yeah, hurry up.

Who's, uh... Who's that?

58:46.773 --> 58:50.392
Oh. That man
is a hard-working bricklayer

58:50.485 --> 58:52.226

Now he just sitting on the curb,

and then everybody passing him by,
trying not to look at him.

58:59.995 --> 59:00.985
Let me ask you.

59:02.205 --> 59:04.913
When you give a homeless man
a plate of food or a dollar,

59:05.000 --> 59:06.286
what do you think you're doing?

59:08.003 --> 59:09.619
Uh... I don't... Helping?

59:09.963 --> 59:13.331
No. A plate of food
don't change nothing.

59:14.634 --> 59:16.125
He still be homeless.

59:16.636 --> 59:22.132
All you're doing is saying,
"You ain't invisible. I see you."

59:23.060 --> 59:24.141
That's all.

59:28.023 --> 59:29.013
Thank you.

59:31.068 --> 59:32.559
Debbie's putting on a show tonight.

You oughta come over.

I'm not sure.

01:01:10.375 --> 01:01:11.707

What, you ain't got no man?
Your man let you out here?

01:01:47.954 --> 01:01:49.991
I got somewhere

01:01:51.166 --> 01:01:53.123
All right, Miss Lady. Fine.

What you doing here?

01:02:20.237 --> 01:02:22.650
I didn't see you at the movie,

01:02:24.532 --> 01:02:26.945
Just through here. Um...

01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:29.277
There are clean towels
in the bathroom.

what that man's mental condition is.

- We not even gonna talk about this?
- Ronnie, just trust me.

And we have children in the house.

And I don't know what the plan is,
Debbie.

01:03:07.492 --> 01:03:09.154
What're you gonna do?
You gonna just save them all?

01:03:09.661 --> 01:03:10.697
I'll try.

01:03:11.079 --> 01:03:13.071

Honey, I know you wanna help him.
I do. I understand that. I do too.

01:03:17.127 --> 01:03:20.120
But promise me you'll talk to me
before you do something like this.

[sighs] I promise.

01:03:30.473 --> 01:03:31.463

01:04:14.142 --> 01:04:15.474
Come on in. Have a cup of coffee.

01:04:19.105 --> 01:04:20.346
Hi. Good morning.

01:04:23.068 --> 01:04:24.024
Y'all hungry?

01:04:25.945 --> 01:04:26.935
You want coffee?

01:04:27.405 --> 01:04:30.148
There's some juice over here too,
if you want any.

01:04:31.409 --> 01:04:33.116

Some things you need
to know about me.

01:05:06.569 --> 01:05:07.650
What things?

01:05:08.738 --> 01:05:10.900
Done some bad things, Miss Debbie.

01:05:13.493 --> 01:05:14.825
Never told you.

01:05:16.913 --> 01:05:18.495
Hope I might not have to.

01:05:19.582 --> 01:05:21.790
But I guess some things
don't get forgotten.

01:05:24.295 --> 01:05:25.285
It's okay.

01:05:27.465 --> 01:05:28.455

I didn't know about World War Il
or the war in Korea.

01:06:15.388 --> 01:06:17.801
I didn't know
colored folks been rising up.

01:06:20.310 --> 01:06:21.676
<i>He didn't tell me.</i>

01:06:22.770 --> 01:06:24.682

It might be hard for you to believe,

01:06:38.661 --> 01:06:41.529
but you go down
to Red River Parish today,

01:06:42.415 --> 01:06:46.785
and you might see how a colored man
who couldn't read,

01:06:47.337 --> 01:06:51.001
didn't have no radio,
no telephone, no electricity,

01:06:51.090 --> 01:06:53.798
might fall through a crack in time
and get stuck.

01:06:57.639 --> 01:07:01.007
Now, I knowed
there was other places.

01:07:02.393 --> 01:07:08.014
So one day, I just ran
toward them tracks and hop on.

Open that box
and give me that money.

Open that box
and give me that money.

01:08:34.277 --> 01:08:35.688
Put that gun down, boy.

<i>I was mean and bad.</i>

01:08:43.368 --> 01:08:45.577
But not mean and bad enough
to shoot a man

01:08:45.662 --> 01:08:47.825
just 'cause he showed up for work
on the wrong day.

01:08:49.417 --> 01:08:52.581

'Cause that's how they ran

There weren't enough guards, so they
gave some of the inmates guns.

A lot of times, the same fella
that was working with me one day

01:09:19.529 --> 01:09:20.895
didn't show up the day after.

01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:24.282
Nobody ever saw him again.

to the gators.

In Angola, a man without a knife

01:09:36.714 --> 01:09:40.082
was either gonna end up dead
or worse.

01:09:47.642 --> 01:09:48.598
That night...

01:09:50.895 --> 01:09:54.059

in my cell,

01:09:54.148 --> 01:09:56.060
with three of his friend.

01:09:59.195 --> 01:10:00.857
And I had that knife.

01:10:01.531 --> 01:10:02.897
I use it.

01:10:07.412 --> 01:10:09.529
Went into Angola as a boy...

I'm sorry I never told you that.

01:10:34.063 --> 01:10:36.521

I was a felon...

01:10:41.946 --> 01:10:43.938
ain't no way you'd want me around.

01:10:50.788 --> 01:10:52.279
You're not a bad man.

01:11:01.758 --> 01:11:03.841
You have the strongest heart.

01:11:42.381 --> 01:11:43.246
It's okay.

01:11:46.052 --> 01:11:48.169
Something else, Mr. Ron.

01:11:58.189 --> 01:12:00.226
The work Miss Debbie's doing...

01:12:01.025 --> 01:12:02.516
is very important.

01:12:03.903 --> 01:12:06.270
She's becoming precious to God.

01:12:10.993 --> 01:12:12.780
When you is precious to God...

01:12:14.747 --> 01:12:16.488
you as important to Satan.

01:12:21.128 --> 01:12:21.993
Yeah?

01:12:48.072 --> 01:12:50.405
- Hey, Dad.
- You are hitting that ball.

01:12:50.491 --> 01:12:53.325
- [chuckles] It's okay.
- No, you played great out there.

01:12:53.411 --> 01:12:56.700
I'm so proud of you. She's hitting
the ball good, isn't she? Huh?

01:12:56.789 --> 01:12:59.623
- [grunts]
- Yeah, she is, trust me.

01:13:00.001 --> 01:13:02.618
Well, I'm gonna go change.
Good to see you, Denver.

01:13:02.712 --> 01:13:03.543
We'll get a bite.

01:13:03.629 --> 01:13:04.619
- Okay.
- All right.

01:13:05.381 --> 01:13:08.590
This some sort of rich folk game?

01:13:08.676 --> 01:13:10.918
Tennis? No, no. Anybody can play.

01:13:11.012 --> 01:13:12.628
You just make a reservation.

01:13:12.722 --> 01:13:14.133
You wanna give it a shot,
we'll do it.

01:13:14.223 --> 01:13:15.054
A what?

01:13:15.141 --> 01:13:18.134
Reservation. It's, uh...
It's an appointment.

01:13:18.227 --> 01:13:20.184
You make an appointment
to come out here and play.

01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:22.596
Mr. Ron.

01:13:23.107 --> 01:13:26.066
Any game you has to have
a reservation to play...

01:13:26.569 --> 01:13:27.559
is a rich folk game.

01:13:27.653 --> 01:13:29.019
Well, you may be right. Come on.

01:13:29.614 --> 01:13:31.731
- Did you hear me?
- Yeah, yeah. Let's go.

01:13:45.630 --> 01:13:47.371
- Ron.
- Hey, Hank, how are you?

01:13:47.465 --> 01:13:48.751
Good. Good.

01:13:48.841 --> 01:13:50.298
[water shuts off]

01:13:50.384 --> 01:13:53.001
Listen, Ron, I think it's amazing
what you guys have done

01:13:53.095 --> 01:13:53.960
over at the mission.

01:13:54.180 --> 01:13:55.341
[mutters]

01:13:55.431 --> 01:13:56.262
I do wonder, though,

01:13:56.349 --> 01:13:58.261
if maybe you aren't taking things
a bit too far.

01:13:59.518 --> 01:14:01.430
What are you talking about?
I don't follow.

01:14:02.355 --> 01:14:05.268
Listen, buddy,
I'm a philanthropist too, okay?

01:14:05.650 --> 01:14:07.232
You wanna have a benefit,
raise some funds,

01:14:07.318 --> 01:14:08.934
I'll be the first one
to cut a check.

01:14:10.112 --> 01:14:12.570
But we come here to get away
from the world for a while.

01:14:13.115 --> 01:14:14.447
And I'm not sure what good it is

01:14:14.533 --> 01:14:17.776
to remind us all
how fortunate we are over lunch.

01:14:19.413 --> 01:14:22.747
Right. Talking about my friend
Denver, right?

01:14:25.252 --> 01:14:28.336
Look, Ron, straight up,
I like you, I like your wife.

01:14:29.465 --> 01:14:31.548
But I, along with most
of the other members,

01:14:31.634 --> 01:14:34.377
have a problem with you bringing
your amigo Negro around.

01:14:34.679 --> 01:14:37.262
Sure.
You can tell him that yourself.

01:14:37.348 --> 01:14:39.135
He's standing right there.
That's Denver.

01:14:39.809 --> 01:14:41.300
My "amigo Negro."

01:14:49.485 --> 01:14:51.317
You got my back, Mr. Ron.

01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:54.441
We's friend.

01:14:59.245 --> 01:15:00.156
You gonna flush that?

01:15:00.746 --> 01:15:02.487
Oh, yeah, I always forget that part.

01:15:04.583 --> 01:15:06.700
[toilet flushes]

01:15:18.014 --> 01:15:21.132
- Y'all do this down there.
- "Down there."

01:15:22.143 --> 01:15:24.305
I am not that short.

01:15:25.980 --> 01:15:27.892
- [chuckles]
- I know you're not.

01:15:29.608 --> 01:15:31.850
Your spirit
is much bigger than that.

01:15:43.205 --> 01:15:45.868
Okay, that's good.
Set the plate towards the street.

01:15:50.296 --> 01:15:51.628
[cell phone ringing]

01:15:51.714 --> 01:15:53.922
I think it's better back there.

01:15:54.592 --> 01:15:55.628
Can you put it back?

01:15:56.802 --> 01:15:57.633
Ron Hall.

01:16:05.978 --> 01:16:08.561
[man] Kidneys are up here.
Bladder here.

01:16:08.939 --> 01:16:11.306
And this is the spot right here
that we're worried about.

01:16:11.734 --> 01:16:14.226
Okay? We have to do further tests,

01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:15.811
but we don't know what it is
right now.

01:16:20.743 --> 01:16:22.905
[monitor beeping]

01:16:39.345 --> 01:16:41.132
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:16:42.848 --> 01:16:43.713
Hi.

01:16:46.102 --> 01:16:47.343
How long have I been out?

01:16:49.522 --> 01:16:50.603
Couple hours.

01:16:52.316 --> 01:16:54.433
- Yeah.
- Where are the kids?

01:16:55.277 --> 01:16:57.064
They just went downstairs
to get a bite.

01:16:59.365 --> 01:17:00.981
They've been here the whole time.

01:17:10.835 --> 01:17:12.701
[mouthing words]

01:17:19.552 --> 01:17:20.633
Cancer.

01:17:21.470 --> 01:17:22.426
Gonna beat it.

01:17:23.973 --> 01:17:24.804
Okay?

01:17:40.156 --> 01:17:41.397
[mouths words]

01:18:12.396 --> 01:18:14.854
I prayed all last night.

01:18:25.701 --> 01:18:28.159
I asked God to heal her.

01:18:29.705 --> 01:18:31.697
I also ask him why.

01:18:33.167 --> 01:18:35.375
Why have you done this to a woman

01:18:35.461 --> 01:18:38.499
who has been nothing
but a faithful servant to you?

01:18:39.298 --> 01:18:42.291
Doing what you say, helping folk.

01:18:45.221 --> 01:18:47.258
It really don't make no sense to me.

01:18:52.144 --> 01:18:54.010
But every once in a while...

01:18:54.980 --> 01:18:58.690
I'd see a shooting star
burn across the black sky.

01:18:59.944 --> 01:19:01.276
Bright one minute.

01:19:02.446 --> 01:19:03.937
And gone the next.

01:19:04.823 --> 01:19:07.816
I couldn't understand why
I never could see where it went.

01:19:09.954 --> 01:19:13.038
I think God was giving me a lesson
about Miss Debbie.

01:19:14.500 --> 01:19:20.041
And the Word say God put every stars
in the heaven.

01:19:21.590 --> 01:19:24.253
And he even gave every one of them
a name.

01:19:25.302 --> 01:19:27.669
If one was gonna fall from the sky,

01:19:28.430 --> 01:19:30.012
that was up to him too.

01:19:31.684 --> 01:19:34.347
Maybe we can't see
where it's gonna wind up.

01:19:35.896 --> 01:19:37.228
But God can.

01:19:49.451 --> 01:19:50.362
Hey.

01:19:52.913 --> 01:19:54.279
Where are you gonna be
in the morning?

01:19:55.165 --> 01:19:57.703
I'm homeless. Where else would I be?

01:20:08.554 --> 01:20:09.544
[gunshot]

01:20:11.056 --> 01:20:12.467
- [Ron] Pull.
- [mechanism clicks]

01:20:14.310 --> 01:20:15.471
[gunshot]

01:20:18.856 --> 01:20:19.767
Pull.

01:20:23.360 --> 01:20:24.692
That's all there is to it, boys.

01:20:25.446 --> 01:20:27.733
And here I thought
white folk fishing was odd.

01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:29.401
You call this hunting?

01:20:29.491 --> 01:20:31.027
No, Denver.
You'd actually like this.

01:20:31.118 --> 01:20:32.029
Get up here. Come on.

01:20:32.494 --> 01:20:34.656
Guns ain't not toys, Mr. Ron.

01:20:35.372 --> 01:20:38.331
When I shoot one, it's business.

01:20:41.337 --> 01:20:43.750
I'll go see if Miss Debbie
needs some help in the kitchen.

01:20:43.839 --> 01:20:44.829
[Ron] All right.

01:20:52.723 --> 01:20:56.012
You weren't really gonna let...
let him have that gun, were you?

01:20:58.103 --> 01:20:59.469
You gonna do this now, Earl?

01:21:01.482 --> 01:21:02.438
Hmm?

01:21:03.192 --> 01:21:04.728
I'm gonna make myself a drink.

01:21:08.113 --> 01:21:10.730
Hey, what is it about Denver
that bothers you anyway?

01:21:11.533 --> 01:21:13.115
Why should anything about him
bother me?

01:21:13.202 --> 01:21:15.114
I think giving a loaded shotgun

01:21:15.204 --> 01:21:17.196
to a man who lives in a Dumpster
on purpose

01:21:17.289 --> 01:21:18.951
is a perfectly sane thing to do.

01:21:19.041 --> 01:21:20.577
Try not to do it when I'm around.

01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:23.167
And one other thing.

01:21:24.922 --> 01:21:27.665
Does he have to be invited
to every family gathering?

01:21:32.471 --> 01:21:33.507
Know what I mean?

01:21:35.432 --> 01:21:36.297
Pull.

01:21:37.601 --> 01:21:40.560
[Ron] What about this guy down here?
The tall one.

01:21:40.646 --> 01:21:43.104
[Earl] Still waters run deep.

01:21:43.190 --> 01:21:44.397
- [Debbie] Okay.
- [Ron] Look at this.

01:21:44.483 --> 01:21:47.317
- That's it. There we go.
- [Ron] Oh, my God.

01:21:47.778 --> 01:21:48.609
Great job.

01:21:48.695 --> 01:21:49.936
[Tommye] Everything looks beautiful.

01:21:50.030 --> 01:21:52.568
- Oh, no. It was nothing.
- Amazing job.

01:21:52.658 --> 01:21:54.615
[chuckles] Yes.

01:21:56.328 --> 01:21:57.444
- Thank you.
- So good.

01:21:57.538 --> 01:21:58.528
Good.

01:21:59.581 --> 01:22:02.870
I'm just grateful
that we can all be here together.

01:22:04.545 --> 01:22:06.537
Hey, Mama, you wanna say grace?

01:22:07.131 --> 01:22:08.247
Of course.

01:22:08.632 --> 01:22:10.544
Why don't you let Denver do it?

01:22:14.930 --> 01:22:15.920
Yeah, okay.

01:22:18.517 --> 01:22:19.883
Oh, boy. Really?

01:22:21.979 --> 01:22:22.935
Yeah.

01:22:26.316 --> 01:22:30.981
Lord,
we here to celebrate your birthday.

01:22:31.989 --> 01:22:34.823
And we thank you for the good folk
around this table.

01:22:36.535 --> 01:22:40.154
I know most folk think they's
the only customer God got.

01:22:41.623 --> 01:22:43.706
So we ain't gonna ask
too much today.

01:22:45.669 --> 01:22:48.082
We just asking you
to clean up the mess

01:22:48.505 --> 01:22:50.997
and praise you
for giving Miss Debbie

01:22:51.425 --> 01:22:55.419
the strength
to prepare this celebration.

01:22:56.513 --> 01:22:59.722
In your precious name. Amen.

01:23:00.267 --> 01:23:01.758
- [mouths word]
- [all] Amen.

01:23:02.436 --> 01:23:04.302
Thanks. Let's eat.

01:23:04.771 --> 01:23:05.978
- [Tommye] Yes.
- You start that quick.

01:23:06.064 --> 01:23:08.647
I'm starving.
Hope you've been lifting.

01:23:09.234 --> 01:23:10.691
- I do.
- [chuckles]

01:23:10.777 --> 01:23:13.440
[Tommye] Let me get some dressing...

01:23:13.530 --> 01:23:16.523
Yes, can you pass some ham
to Denver, please?

01:23:16.617 --> 01:23:17.903
- You want a roll?
- Absolutely.

01:23:17.993 --> 01:23:18.824
[Earl] I don't know...

01:23:18.911 --> 01:23:19.867
You know she does.
Of course she does.

01:23:19.953 --> 01:23:23.492
...why everyone's making
such a big deal over cancer.

01:23:23.582 --> 01:23:28.202
I've had prostate cancer four years
now. Doesn't bother me a bit.

01:23:28.837 --> 01:23:30.248
Don't worry about it, Deborah.

01:23:31.673 --> 01:23:34.416
Ask me, they're making
a big deal about nothing.

01:23:48.941 --> 01:23:51.604
Nobody asked you.
What is your problem?

01:23:52.903 --> 01:23:54.519
Oh, great. Perfect.

01:23:56.782 --> 01:23:58.614
I'm the bad guy, right?

01:23:59.785 --> 01:24:03.574
Now you're turning
my own grandkids against me.

01:24:06.208 --> 01:24:09.326
- Can't you ever shut up?
- I didn't do anything.

01:24:25.978 --> 01:24:27.219
Let's go home, Tommye.

01:24:31.733 --> 01:24:32.940
[Tommye sighs]

01:24:34.027 --> 01:24:35.359
Drive careful, all right?

01:24:36.613 --> 01:24:37.478
I will.

01:24:39.241 --> 01:24:40.527
[Ron] Okay. Okay, okay.

01:24:41.159 --> 01:24:42.525
- I love you.
- Love you too.

01:24:55.132 --> 01:24:56.213
I don't want your gift.

01:24:57.843 --> 01:24:58.833
Take it.

01:25:02.556 --> 01:25:04.263
And I don't want you
to ever come back here.

01:25:12.774 --> 01:25:14.356
[engine starts]

01:25:30.917 --> 01:25:31.907
Bless him.

01:25:34.171 --> 01:25:35.161
Bless who?

01:25:36.298 --> 01:25:39.757
Your mean old daddy's
got a good man inside of him.

01:25:44.348 --> 01:25:45.634
The way I figure,

01:25:46.183 --> 01:25:49.551
if it hadn't been for him,
there wouldn't be no you.

01:25:50.312 --> 01:25:51.894
And I'd still be in the bushes

01:25:51.980 --> 01:25:55.018
instead of here with you
and your family, Mr. Ron.

01:25:56.568 --> 01:25:58.480
Hey, you're a good man, Denver.

01:26:00.364 --> 01:26:01.571
My father's not.

01:26:02.532 --> 01:26:04.865
He just lost his last chance
to prove me wrong.

01:26:47.661 --> 01:26:49.653
- What are you doing?
- Hey.

01:26:49.746 --> 01:26:52.454
I'm looking through this...
insurance.

01:26:54.793 --> 01:26:55.954
Well, you look great.

01:26:57.129 --> 01:26:58.085
- Thanks.
- Where are you going?

01:26:59.172 --> 01:27:03.542
Well, if I have faith that
I'll be healed,

01:27:04.177 --> 01:27:06.134
I need to start acting normal.

01:27:06.221 --> 01:27:08.178
So, I'm going shopping.

No, of course I am.

No, that wouldn't be normal.

01:27:20.861 --> 01:27:21.692
You sure?

It was a good thing.

01:35:52.664 --> 01:35:56.203
It turned out to be
such a good thing.

01:35:58.002 --> 01:35:58.958
If she hadn't happened,

01:35:59.045 --> 01:36:01.537

would never be this beautiful.

01:36:06.886 --> 01:36:08.752

<i>every one of us has sweet memories

01:42:16.422 --> 01:42:18.288
When Debbie asked me
to do this service,

01:42:18.382 --> 01:42:20.419
she had only one request,

01:42:20.801 --> 01:42:24.385
and that was
that Denver say a few words.

01:42:25.014 --> 01:42:28.132
So, without further ado, for those
who may not know him...

01:42:29.268 --> 01:42:33.228
this is the man of Debbie's dream,
Denver Moore.

01:42:57.421 --> 01:42:59.287
I never met Miss Debbie.

01:43:01.092 --> 01:43:03.254
Miss Debbie met me.

01:43:06.263 --> 01:43:08.220
I didn't want to know Miss Debbie,

01:43:08.307 --> 01:43:10.845
or any other white woman
for that matter.

01:43:13.270 --> 01:43:15.136
But ever since I knowed her...

01:43:16.899 --> 01:43:19.107
Miss Debbie want to be my friend.

01:43:20.736 --> 01:43:23.979
I sure she was friend
to every soul in here.

01:43:27.201 --> 01:43:30.740
I still ain't figured out why
she want to know a fellow like me.

01:43:32.206 --> 01:43:34.789
I sure am been nothing
to be proud of.

01:43:37.503 --> 01:43:42.498
I was captive
in devil's prison most of my life.

01:43:43.008 --> 01:43:46.797
Many folks see me there
in lockup and pass me by.

01:43:48.055 --> 01:43:49.136
I don't blame them.

01:43:50.349 --> 01:43:51.806
I was not nice.

01:43:52.810 --> 01:43:53.846
Dangerous.

01:43:54.186 --> 01:43:57.145
And probably just as happy
to stay in prison.

01:43:58.315 --> 01:44:00.102
But she was different.

01:44:02.194 --> 01:44:04.652
She seen me behind them bars

01:44:05.197 --> 01:44:07.780
and reached way down in her pocket.

01:44:08.409 --> 01:44:13.655
And pulled out a key
God gave her to set me free.

01:44:15.166 --> 01:44:20.457
She's the only person to love me
enough not to give up.

01:44:21.797 --> 01:44:25.711
Now I stand here a changed man.

01:44:27.219 --> 01:44:28.426
A free man.

01:44:30.806 --> 01:44:33.173
I used to spend
a lot of time worrying

01:44:33.851 --> 01:44:35.683
I was different from other people.

01:44:36.061 --> 01:44:37.893
Even other homeless folk.

01:44:38.939 --> 01:44:41.807
But then after I met
Miss Debbie and Mr. Ron...

01:44:43.527 --> 01:44:46.190
I worried I was so different
from them

01:44:46.864 --> 01:44:49.982
that we were never gonna have
no kind of future.

01:44:53.788 --> 01:44:55.745
But what I found out was...

01:44:57.416 --> 01:44:59.373
everybody's different.

01:45:00.586 --> 01:45:02.873
Same kind of different as me.

01:45:06.717 --> 01:45:08.504
We all regular folks

01:45:08.594 --> 01:45:12.258
walking down the street
God done set in front of us.

01:45:14.016 --> 01:45:15.302
And Miss Debbie...

01:45:16.644 --> 01:45:18.852
she's a whole 'nother kind
of different.

01:45:21.232 --> 01:45:26.352
Miss Debbie, she dream
of a better place for the homeless.

01:45:28.030 --> 01:45:29.942
And I ain't talking
about heaven, no.

01:45:32.034 --> 01:45:36.119
I'm talking about right here
in y'alls town.

01:45:37.081 --> 01:45:39.698
Now, I'm gonna pick up
Miss Debbie's torch

01:45:40.459 --> 01:45:42.667
and I'm going to carry it round.

01:45:44.505 --> 01:45:47.168
It would make Miss Debbie real happy

01:45:48.092 --> 01:45:50.175
if you would make her dream
come true...

01:45:51.679 --> 01:45:55.263
and pick up her torch
and carry it round too.

01:45:59.103 --> 01:46:00.310

01:49:00.576 --> 01:49:02.067
[song stops]

01:49:03.287 --> 01:49:05.495
When Miss Debbie went on up
in heaven,

01:49:06.331 --> 01:49:08.994
I was pretty sure
you gonna cut me loose.

01:49:11.295 --> 01:49:13.958
Yeah. Catch and release.

01:49:14.840 --> 01:49:15.705
Hmm?

01:49:23.724 --> 01:49:25.807
So, you're just gonna come back
and what?

01:49:38.155 --> 01:49:39.691
There's something you need to do.

01:49:43.660 --> 01:49:46.027
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:49:56.590 --> 01:49:58.047
[footsteps approach]

01:49:58.467 --> 01:50:00.129
What... What is it, Tommye?

01:50:00.761 --> 01:50:01.922
[Tommye] Look who's here.

01:50:03.972 --> 01:50:04.803
Hi, Earl.

01:50:05.182 --> 01:50:06.423
Oh.

01:50:06.517 --> 01:50:07.348
[Tommye] You need something?

01:50:07.726 --> 01:50:08.762
No, no. I'm fine.

01:50:08.852 --> 01:50:10.138
[Earl] Isn't that nice?

01:50:12.147 --> 01:50:13.354
Isn't that nice?

01:50:16.568 --> 01:50:17.558
Here.

01:50:19.321 --> 01:50:21.608
Nice of you to visit. Here.

01:50:27.830 --> 01:50:29.037
[clears throat]

01:50:29.957 --> 01:50:31.323
Hey, Earl. How you doing?

01:50:32.793 --> 01:50:34.830
Yeah. Stopped drinking.

01:50:38.632 --> 01:50:39.463
See?

01:50:40.217 --> 01:50:41.503
Never even touched it.

01:50:43.512 --> 01:50:44.969
Big relief for your mother.

01:50:46.014 --> 01:50:47.971
I give her a lot of hell
over the years.

01:50:48.934 --> 01:50:49.890
What about me?

01:50:54.648 --> 01:50:56.139
Yeah,
you give her a lot of hell too.

01:50:57.317 --> 01:50:59.229
- [chuckles]
- Yeah.

01:51:02.114 --> 01:51:02.979
What you reading?

01:51:03.615 --> 01:51:06.449
It's a book of stories, poetry.

01:51:06.535 --> 01:51:08.322
I used to read to you
when you were little.

01:51:09.329 --> 01:51:12.037
- You never liked it much.
- That is not true.

01:51:15.127 --> 01:51:16.334
Good English poet.

01:51:17.921 --> 01:51:18.911
William, uh...

01:51:20.424 --> 01:51:22.131
- Uh...
- Blake.

01:51:24.052 --> 01:51:25.463
William Blake, yeah.

01:51:27.764 --> 01:51:28.675
A bird.

01:51:29.892 --> 01:51:30.928
The nest.

01:51:33.896 --> 01:51:35.683
A spider. The web.

01:51:37.316 --> 01:51:38.181
Man.

01:51:41.737 --> 01:51:42.648
Friendship.

01:51:46.742 --> 01:51:47.823
So how's your friend?

01:51:48.535 --> 01:51:49.491
Denver?

01:51:51.747 --> 01:51:53.659
Denver, he's good. He's good.

01:51:53.749 --> 01:51:57.163
We're gonna go out
to Rocky Top later, visit Debbie.

01:51:57.502 --> 01:51:58.413
Oh.

01:51:59.296 --> 01:52:00.161
Yeah.

01:52:00.589 --> 01:52:02.205
I always liked Debbie.

01:52:03.425 --> 01:52:04.415
Deborah.

01:52:04.801 --> 01:52:06.508
[clicks tongue] Always liked her.

01:52:08.680 --> 01:52:09.716
Good for you.

01:52:11.642 --> 01:52:14.760
For working things out,
staying... staying together.

01:52:16.688 --> 01:52:17.974
Well, she was a good woman.

01:52:19.858 --> 01:52:20.723
So is your mother.

01:52:21.735 --> 01:52:22.566
What's that?

01:52:25.364 --> 01:52:26.320
Oh, nothing.

01:52:30.577 --> 01:52:31.567
[softly] We got lucky.

01:52:33.622 --> 01:52:34.783
We both got lucky.

01:52:35.707 --> 01:52:37.619
We might actually agree
on something there.

01:52:39.378 --> 01:52:40.710
Oh, don't worry about it.

01:52:40.921 --> 01:52:42.503
[chuckles]

01:52:48.637 --> 01:52:50.344
Dad, you wanna
get a little fresh air?

01:52:53.267 --> 01:52:55.350
- There she goes.
- My old horse.

01:52:57.896 --> 01:52:59.012
- Can you get up?
- Yeah.

01:52:59.690 --> 01:53:01.431
- Cowboying up.
- All right.

01:53:03.819 --> 01:53:06.311
Be careful, all right?

01:53:06.405 --> 01:53:07.441
[mutters]

01:53:08.490 --> 01:53:10.072
Let's see if she remembers me.

01:53:11.743 --> 01:53:13.279
[engine starts]

01:53:14.079 --> 01:53:15.115
She does.

01:53:19.835 --> 01:53:20.825
Careful.

01:53:35.100 --> 01:53:36.341
Crazy old man.

01:53:40.939 --> 01:53:41.929
How you doing?

01:53:43.692 --> 01:53:44.603
I'm good.

01:53:46.320 --> 01:53:47.777
- Good.
- It's a good day.

01:53:49.031 --> 01:53:50.192
[mouths word]

01:54:12.012 --> 01:54:13.594
You were right about my dad, Denver.

01:54:15.974 --> 01:54:17.181
There's a good man in there.

01:54:18.769 --> 01:54:20.681
Had to dig pretty far down
to find him.

01:54:23.273 --> 01:54:26.812
Sometimes you just got to
bless the hell out of people.

01:54:28.695 --> 01:54:30.937
And your daddy
had a lot of hell in there.

01:54:31.031 --> 01:54:32.943
- [chuckling]
- [Ron] Yeah, he did.

01:54:34.701 --> 01:54:37.239
Ain't none of my business,
but what do it say?

01:54:38.288 --> 01:54:39.449
It says, "Arms of God."

01:54:41.041 --> 01:54:42.031
Nice.

01:54:45.003 --> 01:54:46.369
Think any of those are named Debbie?

01:54:48.882 --> 01:54:50.418
Well, somebody once told me

01:54:50.509 --> 01:54:52.751
that God names all the stars
in the sky.

01:54:55.597 --> 01:54:57.634
What crazy old man told you that?

01:54:58.934 --> 01:55:00.425
[chuckles]

01:55:02.729 --> 01:55:03.594
Okay.

01:55:04.773 --> 01:55:07.015
- Hey. There you go.
- Oh, yeah.

01:55:07.109 --> 01:55:08.600
- Huh?
- There she goes.

01:55:09.861 --> 01:55:10.692
[Denver] Yeah.

01:55:12.322 --> 01:55:13.654
That's her right there.

01:55:17.244 --> 01:55:18.075
