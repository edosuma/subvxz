00:50.508 --> 00:52.969
<i>But sometimes, if we're lucky,</i>

00:53.052 --> 00:56.139
<i>the Yuletide stars</i>

00:56.222 --> 00:58.224

00:58.308 --> 01:04.481

01:12.864 --> 01:16.409
[Ralphie]
<i>Ah, there it is.</i>
<i>Our humble abode</i>

01:16.493 --> 01:18.495

<i>One day you're playing</i>

01:32.300 --> 01:38.056
<i>And the next thing you know,</i>

01:38.139 --> 01:44.145
<i>But no matter. My sights were</i>
<i>set on a higher purpose.</i>

01:44.229 --> 01:47.607
<i>And I was gonna</i>

01:50.819 --> 01:53.112
<i>Even though times were lean,</i>

01:55.114 --> 01:58.952
<i>At least that's what we told</i>
<i>our kids, Mark and Julie.</i>

01:59.035 --> 02:02.455
[Julie] Okay,
but what if there's
a fire in the fireplace?

02:02.539 --> 02:04.374
Santa is fireproof.

02:04.457 --> 02:06.793
What if the fireplace
is too small?

02:06.876 --> 02:08.378
He sneaks in a window.

02:08.461 --> 02:09.504
Good morning.

02:09.587 --> 02:11.047
-Good morning, Mom.
-Morning.

02:11.131 --> 02:12.465
What if the window is stuck?

02:12.549 --> 02:14.175
He has WD-40.

02:14.259 --> 02:15.927
-What if the window
is too small?
-He sucks in his gut.

02:16.010 --> 02:17.470
-Hey. Get your breakfast.
-Okay.

02:17.554 --> 02:19.389
[both] Yes, Mom.

02:19.472 --> 02:21.224
[Ralphie]<i> While the kids</i>
<i>counted the days</i>
<i>left 'til Christmas,</i>

02:21.307 --> 02:23.893
<i>I was racing against the clock.</i>

02:23.977 --> 02:28.022
<i>We had socked away just enough</i>

02:40.451 --> 02:42.412
Dad! We're out of milk.

02:42.495 --> 02:46.124
-What?
-My fault, my fault.
I forgot to get it.

02:46.207 --> 02:51.880
But have you ever had
the delicacy of cereal with...

02:54.757 --> 02:55.592
orange juice?

02:55.675 --> 02:57.093
-[groans]
-Ew.

02:57.176 --> 02:59.554
Nobody? You are in for a treat.

02:59.637 --> 03:02.307
Nice bowl full of cocoa buds

03:02.390 --> 03:06.185
poured with some
delicious OJ. Hm.

03:06.269 --> 03:08.313
And then... [slurps]

03:08.396 --> 03:10.023
[Mark] Ugh. That's disgusting.

03:10.106 --> 03:11.316
-Mm.
-Ew.

03:12.358 --> 03:15.361
Mm. You can't beat that.

03:15.445 --> 03:16.946
There you go, sweetie.

03:17.906 --> 03:19.699
Well, you gonna try it?

03:19.782 --> 03:21.492
-Mom, you go first.
-No.

03:21.576 --> 03:23.536
Dad, when can we
take out the stockings?

03:23.620 --> 03:26.080
Let's wait for Grandpa.
He loves that stuff.

03:26.164 --> 03:28.458
Yeah, you guys
can do it together.

03:28.541 --> 03:31.210
The angel! She's so beautiful.

03:31.294 --> 03:34.714
It's almost Christmas
and we don't have
a tree for our angel.

03:34.797 --> 03:36.299
I know, honey.
We're gonna get a tree

03:36.382 --> 03:39.010
as soon as Grandma and Grandpa
get here. Two more days.

03:39.093 --> 03:41.512
I feel like I've
been waiting forever.

03:41.596 --> 03:44.807
[Ralphie]<i> Every year,</i>
<i>my parents made</i>

04:47.704 --> 04:49.455
Mr. Parker...

04:49.539 --> 04:54.002
we generally handle
this sort of meeting with
a written correspondence,

04:54.085 --> 04:56.713
but your insistence
to meet in person--

04:56.796 --> 04:59.716
Oh. Uh, I brought you
a little something.

04:59.799 --> 05:02.510
<i>Greasing the wheels</i>

05:02.593 --> 05:04.137
Marshall Field's.

The good stuff.

05:07.682 --> 05:08.808
Is this...

05:09.934 --> 05:11.978
a bribe?

05:12.061 --> 05:13.187
I don't know.

05:13.938 --> 05:15.148
You tell me.

05:24.574 --> 05:25.742
[chuckles]

05:25.825 --> 05:27.910
Your manuscript,
<i>Jupiter's Oblivion--</i>

05:27.994 --> 05:30.747
Uh, Neptune.
It's<i> Neptune's Oblivion.</i>

05:30.830 --> 05:34.167
Though an interesting title
and thoroughly written,

05:34.250 --> 05:37.670
we're not accepting manuscripts
over 2,000 pages.

05:37.754 --> 05:39.422
Oh. Well, I could
cut it down a bit.

05:39.505 --> 05:42.091
You could cut it in half
and there'd still
be too many words.

05:42.175 --> 05:44.844
Ah, Well, I know
it doesn't feel like it ends,

05:44.927 --> 05:49.265
but that's because
it all pays off in the sequel,
which I'm writing right now.

05:49.348 --> 05:51.267
Oh, Lord, not more.

05:53.019 --> 05:56.898
This isn't a subject
we're interested in...

05:56.981 --> 05:58.274
-at all.
-No.

05:58.357 --> 06:00.026
This has been

06:00.109 --> 06:01.986
Good day, Mr. Parker.

06:02.070 --> 06:03.654

07:10.012 --> 07:11.556
I said good day.

07:11.639 --> 07:15.560
Oh, right. Good day.

07:18.813 --> 07:21.315
[Sandy] Well, there's still
one publisher left.

07:21.399 --> 07:22.859
Yeah.

07:22.942 --> 07:24.360
Hey, you know,
I heard that Mark Twain

07:24.443 --> 07:27.280
got rejected 34 times
before he got published.

07:27.363 --> 07:30.867
-That's brutal.
-Yeah.

07:30.950 --> 07:33.202
-I just mean you're
in good company.
-Thanks.

07:33.286 --> 07:38.249
-[Sandy] But he actually said
that you could cut it in half?
-That's crazy, right?

07:38.332 --> 07:39.876
I mean, it is...

07:39.959 --> 07:42.545
a little wordy.

07:42.628 --> 07:44.589
[Ralphie] It's an epic saga.

07:44.672 --> 07:47.216
[Sandy] Right, honey.
Are you sure you should be
writing a sequel? I mean--

07:47.300 --> 07:50.970
The first thing they're
gonna ask when it sells is,
"What's next?"

07:51.053 --> 07:53.848
Okay. No, I mean,
you're the expert.

07:53.931 --> 07:55.892
-Well, what do you suggest?
-Well, okay.

07:55.975 --> 07:57.393
Honey, you write so well.

07:57.476 --> 07:59.353
And you have
such a strong voice.

07:59.437 --> 08:01.772
So maybe you could
write something that's...

08:02.607 --> 08:04.609
like, more relatable.

08:04.692 --> 08:06.068
You know, Denise
at the Book Barn,

08:06.152 --> 08:08.321
she says true crime
is the next big thing.

08:08.404 --> 08:09.739
[Ralphie]<i> That's it.</i>

08:09.822 --> 08:12.158
<i>A book about strangling Denise</i>
<i>from Book Barn.</i>

08:12.241 --> 08:13.868
Can I have another
piece of pizza?

08:13.951 --> 08:15.953
Here you go. Take mine.

08:19.165 --> 08:21.083
Well, what do you guys
want for Christmas?

08:21.167 --> 08:23.794
An Easy-Bake Oven,
Hungry Hungry Hippos

08:23.878 --> 08:25.171
and a stuffed kitty cat.

08:25.254 --> 08:27.715
[chuckles] Got it.
What about you?

08:27.798 --> 08:30.134
A Flexible Flyer F-23
Yankee Clipper.

08:30.218 --> 08:31.552
And what is that?

08:31.636 --> 08:34.514
-A sled.
-Oh, okay. I'm sorry.

08:34.597 --> 08:35.890
What do you want, Dad?

08:36.599 --> 08:37.683
Want?

08:37.767 --> 08:40.853
A time machine
to restart the year.

08:40.937 --> 08:43.773
What I need is a new radiator
for the Plymouth.

08:43.856 --> 08:45.483
-[phone ringing]
-Oh. I got it. I got it.

08:45.566 --> 08:49.070
-Could be my manager
with some good news.
-Okay.

[Ralphie clears throat]

08:50.488 --> 08:52.823
Mr. Ralph Parker speaking.

08:52.907 --> 08:55.243
-Hi, Mom.
-Nope. It's Grandma.

08:58.287 --> 08:59.789
What's wrong?

08:59.872 --> 09:00.748
What?

09:04.043 --> 09:05.044
What?

09:10.091 --> 09:11.300
Wait. Wait a minute.

09:17.056 --> 09:18.099
Okay.

09:18.933 --> 09:20.142

09:21.352 --> 09:22.436
Uh-huh.

[Ralphie]<i> Nothing</i>

Yeah. You can taste it.

10:11.110 --> 10:12.737
Oh, come on. It's not that bad.

10:12.820 --> 10:15.781
You said the birds
fly backwards
so they don't choke.

10:15.865 --> 10:18.743
And the sludge pool
swallowed children whole.

10:20.453 --> 10:21.912
Does Santa go to Hohman?

10:21.996 --> 10:23.956
Yeah, of course.
Why wouldn't he?

10:24.040 --> 10:27.835
Because Dad said
winter in Hohman is so bleak,
it crushes the human spirit.

10:27.918 --> 10:30.212
[Ralphie]<i> Kids ignore</i>
<i>every important</i>
<i>thing you say,</i>

Santa loves Hohman.

10:39.388 --> 10:41.223
In fact, if you play
your cards right,

10:41.307 --> 10:42.767
you'll get to meet him
at Higbee's.

10:42.850 --> 10:44.769

10:44.852 --> 10:47.563
Oh, it's him. Trust me.

10:47.646 --> 10:49.482

a Merry Christmas as well.

21:56.440 --> 21:58.525
[crowd sighs in relief]

21:58.608 --> 22:00.902
[Ralphie]<i> You ever wonder</i>
<i>what happened to your</i>
<i>high school quarterback?</i>

22:00.986 --> 22:04.156
<i>Ours turned into</i>
<i>good old Larry Novak.</i>

22:04.239 --> 22:06.742
So what do you guys do
around here for Christmas
these days?

22:06.825 --> 22:08.452
[sighs] It's the same here
as it's always been.

22:08.535 --> 22:09.619
Yeah, just the usual.

22:09.703 --> 22:11.121
No, the usual's
not gonna cut it.

22:11.204 --> 22:13.040
I need something more.
It's all on me this year.

22:13.123 --> 22:15.917
Well, in that case,
I suggest you start drinking

22:16.001 --> 22:17.252
and don't stop till New Year's.

22:17.336 --> 22:18.920
No, this is serious.

22:19.463 --> 22:20.255
Larry?

22:20.338 --> 22:21.590
What do you want from me?

22:21.673 --> 22:23.675
I come here to avoid my family.

22:25.093 --> 22:27.471
All right. Got an idea.
Here, you take that.

22:27.554 --> 22:29.639
-We'll come up with some idea.
-All right.

22:29.723 --> 22:32.225
So, let's make a list.
It's okay. You're gonna
be fine. We got this. Okay.

22:32.309 --> 22:34.603
Ooh! But first,
line 'em up again.

22:34.686 --> 22:36.980
-To lubricate our brains,
right? Come on.
-It's a good idea.

22:37.064 --> 22:39.733
-Christmas is...
-I have a terrarium.

22:40.942 --> 22:42.069
Okay.

22:42.152 --> 22:45.363
It's a fish tank
for snakes and lizards.

22:45.447 --> 22:47.240
It's very stimulating.

22:47.324 --> 22:49.451
-[Schwartz] Ah.
-Cool. That's a great start.
I love terrariums.

22:49.534 --> 22:52.079
Hey. My sister knows
a guy who owns a Cessna.

22:52.162 --> 22:54.790
-My cousin Craig,
he's got a buffalo.
-Yeah.

22:54.873 --> 22:56.291
Oh, that'd be fantastic.

22:56.375 --> 22:58.460
-It's huge.
-No bad ideas, guys.
Keep 'em coming.

22:58.543 --> 23:00.337
I need this stuff.

23:00.420 --> 23:02.089
-We got you covered.
We got you.
-It's the kind of magic I need.

23:02.172 --> 23:02.672
-Come on, to Christmas.
-We got you. Christmas!

23:04.966 --> 23:06.384
[snores]

23:06.468 --> 23:08.095
[chatter echoing]

23:15.352 --> 23:16.812
Ralph?

23:16.895 --> 23:19.314
It's almost 10:00.
Are you awake?

23:19.397 --> 23:21.316
-Uh-uh.
-Mm.

23:21.399 --> 23:23.276
[smacks lips, breathes deeply]

23:23.360 --> 23:27.072
So, is this the list?

23:27.155 --> 23:30.659
You know, the one
you woke me up about
at 3:00 am?

23:30.742 --> 23:31.868
Yeah.

23:31.952 --> 23:34.621
That's my Christmas plan.
[grunting]

23:34.704 --> 23:36.665
Okay. All right.

23:36.748 --> 23:39.417
Well, you know,
some of these are good.

23:39.501 --> 23:41.002
Yeah, sledding. That's great.

23:41.086 --> 23:42.504
Maybe you and Mark
could do that.

23:42.587 --> 23:44.548
-You know, father-son outing.
-Okay. Great.

23:44.631 --> 23:47.425
But some of these are...

23:47.509 --> 23:48.677
wax throwing?

23:48.760 --> 23:50.178
Axe. Axe throwing.

23:50.262 --> 23:53.849
-With the tomahawks and stuff.
-Okay. Even better.

23:53.932 --> 23:57.769
Uh, "Make them catch
and kill their own turkey."
Ooh. [chuckles]

23:57.853 --> 24:00.397
Well, maybe we could
combine that
with the axe throwing.

24:00.480 --> 24:02.190
Could be fun
for the kids, I think.

24:02.274 --> 24:05.193
Right here,
"Volunteer at a soup kitchen."

24:05.277 --> 24:07.028
See, that one's crossed off.

24:07.112 --> 24:08.530
Yeah, it could be too much.

24:08.613 --> 24:10.198
Polar bear plunge.

24:10.282 --> 24:12.200
-Terrarium.
-Yeah.

24:12.284 --> 24:14.035
-Chips and salsa.
-Larry has one.

24:14.119 --> 24:15.745
Overthrow Castro. I'm in.

24:15.829 --> 24:17.414
Ambitious. But we can do it.

24:17.497 --> 24:19.708
Buffalo.
Three exclamation points.

24:19.791 --> 24:21.042
So, do we move there?

24:21.126 --> 24:23.086
No, no, no.
We're gonna bring it here.

24:23.170 --> 24:24.963
[laughing] It's buffalo?

24:25.046 --> 24:26.423
Like an animal?

24:26.506 --> 24:28.258
Yeah, some of these
need to bake, but--

24:28.341 --> 24:31.720
You know, honey,
I think you're maybe
overcomplicating this.

24:31.803 --> 24:33.471
Why don't we just
keep it simple?

24:33.555 --> 24:35.807
Like, we could go ice skating.
You know I would love that.

24:35.891 --> 24:37.392
Oh, I know.

24:37.475 --> 24:40.770
And, you know, maybe we just do
the usual Christmas stuff.

24:40.854 --> 24:42.480
-Really?
-Yeah.

24:42.564 --> 24:46.401
Like, we could start
with just getting
the house decorated. Hm?

24:46.484 --> 24:47.819
-Hm? Okay?
-Hm. Okay.

24:47.903 --> 24:49.863
It's a little boring.
[chuckles]

24:49.946 --> 24:51.948
Okay. So...

24:52.032 --> 24:54.451
Ooh. No, let's start
with the shower.

24:55.911 --> 24:56.995
Okay.

24:57.078 --> 24:58.747
[grunts]

25:01.082 --> 25:02.500
[Mrs. Parker]
Ralphie, be careful!

25:02.584 --> 25:05.962
There's spiders
as big as cats up there!

25:06.046 --> 25:08.256
[Ralphie]
<i>Attics are museums</i>

25:08.340 --> 25:11.176
<i>Littered with junk</i>

25:11.259 --> 25:14.012
<i>but don't have</i>
<i>the courage to throw away.</i>

25:14.095 --> 25:15.555
This place is a mess.

25:15.639 --> 25:17.849
How am I supposed to find
the Christmas stuff up here?

25:17.933 --> 25:19.768
[Mrs. Parker]
In the cardboard boxes!

25:19.851 --> 25:22.103
[Ralphie] Which one?
There's hundreds of them.

25:22.187 --> 25:25.398
[Mrs. Parker] Figure it out.
We're busy down here!

25:27.234 --> 25:29.611
[the old man]<i> He looks like</i>
<i>a deranged Easter bunny.</i>

25:29.694 --> 25:32.239

<i>And still traumatizing.</i>

25:44.334 --> 25:46.711

25:53.468 --> 25:56.054
Oh! [laughs, imitates fanfare]

<i>The motherlode</i>

25:58.473 --> 26:00.141

<i>Wait.</i>

26:02.269 --> 26:03.812
<i>What the hell?</i>

26:03.895 --> 26:05.897
Sandy, honey,
I'm just trying to be helpful.

26:05.981 --> 26:07.482
That does not go there.

26:07.565 --> 26:09.693
I... Okay. It may be
more helpful

26:09.776 --> 26:11.820
-if you start working--
-I'm way ahead of you.

26:11.903 --> 26:13.905
What is this? Ow!

26:13.989 --> 26:15.657
Damn it! It cut me.

26:15.740 --> 26:17.993
No, don't.
Your mouth is just full
of diseases. Come on.

26:18.076 --> 26:20.829
-Let's get some
Bactine on that finger.
-Mom, it's fine.

26:28.586 --> 26:31.589
[blows, sighs]
Your father hated that tree.

26:31.673 --> 26:33.717
So do I.
Where did it come from?

26:33.800 --> 26:37.345
I bought it a few years ago,
thinking it'd
make things easier,

26:37.429 --> 26:40.223
but your father
banished it to the attic.
[chuckles]

26:40.307 --> 26:41.725
[chuckles] He was right.

26:41.808 --> 26:43.518
We're getting a real tree.
Today.

26:43.601 --> 26:44.686
None of that fake junk.

26:44.769 --> 26:46.354
-Well, you're the boss.
-Hm.

Well, I know that
you've got a lot
on your shoulders,

26:54.612 --> 26:56.656
but I need you to do
something for me.

26:56.740 --> 26:58.533
Yeah, Mom. Of course. Anything.

26:58.616 --> 27:01.661
I want you to write
your father's obituary
for the newspaper.

27:02.454 --> 27:03.621
Me?

27:03.705 --> 27:05.707
You are the writer

[Ralphie]

30:55.103 --> 30:58.439
I could give you three...

30:58.523 --> 31:00.233
maybe...

31:00.316 --> 31:02.610
four bucks tops...

31:02.694 --> 31:03.778
for that one.

31:06.406 --> 31:08.449
But, Ralph, isn't that--

31:08.533 --> 31:10.577
[Ralphie]<i> Not now, woman!</i>
<i>I'm about to judo flip</i>
<i>this bozo into the gutter!</i>

31:10.660 --> 31:12.036
Sold.

31:12.120 --> 31:13.454
Thank you so much.

31:13.538 --> 31:15.707
I'll go get the twine.
[chuckles]

31:15.790 --> 31:18.001
Yeah, you bet you will.
[chuckles]

31:18.084 --> 31:19.627
Look at that, huh?

31:19.711 --> 31:22.255
[tree lot guy] Hey, Chuck,
I got rid of the monster tree!

31:22.338 --> 31:23.923
-Bye!
-[tree lot guy chuckles]

31:24.007 --> 31:26.467
[Sandy] Ralph, are you sure
it's gonna fit in the house?

31:26.551 --> 31:28.344
[Ralphie] Oh, you bet.

31:28.428 --> 31:29.596
[Ralphie grunts]

31:29.679 --> 31:31.973
[Ralphie]
<i>My family was enthralled.</i>

31:32.056 --> 31:35.393
<i>Awed by the spectacle</i>
<i>I raised before them.</i>

31:36.352 --> 31:38.271
Isn't it great?

31:38.354 --> 31:41.691
We probably should've trimmed
the tree before
we brought it inside.

31:41.774 --> 31:43.526
No, that's just a saying.

31:43.610 --> 31:45.236
Nobody trims trees.

31:45.320 --> 31:46.904
Besides, it's perfect.

31:46.988 --> 31:49.532
[grunts, sighs]

31:49.616 --> 31:52.869
Yeah. Kinda looks
like it's going
through puberty.

31:52.952 --> 31:55.038
No wonder they gave it
to us for four bucks.

31:55.121 --> 31:59.792
No, it's a wonder how
I actually negotiated
the deal of a lifetime.

32:01.919 --> 32:03.630
Oh! [chuckles]

32:04.380 --> 32:06.591
[laughs]

32:06.674 --> 32:09.052
-Let's get to work. Come on!
-[music playing over radio]

32:09.135 --> 32:11.179
-Okay!
-Come on! Let's go!

32:11.262 --> 32:12.305
Decoration time!

32:12.388 --> 32:14.682

-[Sandy] Radio.

32:16.726 --> 32:18.019
Radio. Okay.

32:18.102 --> 32:20.688
Um, what about this one?
Nothing important?

32:20.772 --> 32:22.023
-No.
-[Ralphie] All right.

32:22.106 --> 32:24.442
Three, two, one...

32:24.525 --> 32:26.152
-[music resumes]
-Hey!

32:26.235 --> 32:28.029
[all cheering]

32:28.112 --> 32:29.697
I don't think we should
have so much red.

32:33.701 --> 32:34.869
I like that. Ooh.

32:34.952 --> 32:36.746
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

32:36.829 --> 32:37.872
[exclaims]

32:39.415 --> 32:41.376

<i>Now, one of the best reasons</i>

32:48.257 --> 32:49.509
This a good place?

32:49.592 --> 32:50.718
-Higher than that.
-[Ralphie] Go, go, go.

32:50.802 --> 32:51.719
-Here?
-[Sandy] Your hand.

32:51.803 --> 32:52.929
-Yeah. Now up.
-Now in.

32:53.012 --> 32:53.971
-Here?
-Both.

32:54.055 --> 32:55.473
In and up.

32:55.556 --> 32:57.016
-Go in and up.
-Why didn't you
just point there?

32:57.100 --> 32:58.851
-[Ralphie] Looks good.
-Yeah.

32:58.935 --> 33:01.896
-Keep it up, guys.
-How come you're not helping?

33:01.979 --> 33:04.065
-We're having fun watching you.
-Yeah.

33:04.148 --> 33:07.485
When it's just us,
it kind of feels like
child labor.

33:07.568 --> 33:08.903
[laughs]

33:08.986 --> 33:11.072
Oh, no, honey, it's not labor
if we don't pay you.

33:11.155 --> 33:13.408
-Yeah.
-[both groan]

33:13.491 --> 33:15.660
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

33:15.743 --> 33:17.954
You're hanging too many
on the bottom.

33:18.037 --> 33:21.249
-Well, I can't reach
that height!
-Use the ladder.

33:21.332 --> 33:22.709
[chuckles]

33:22.792 --> 33:23.876
[Sandy] Careful, honey.

33:23.960 --> 33:25.128
Yeah, Mark, hold the ladder.

33:25.211 --> 33:27.088
I am!

33:27.171 --> 33:28.756
[Ralphie] Yeah, you're
doing good, honey.

33:28.840 --> 33:30.508
-Just get up a little higher.
-It looks really good.

33:30.591 --> 33:31.676
What next?

33:31.759 --> 33:33.094
We have the whole side
over here,

33:33.177 --> 33:34.470
-the one that faces the window.
-Mm-hm.

33:34.554 --> 33:35.888
[sighs]

33:35.972 --> 33:38.099
Grandma! Are you sleeping?

33:38.182 --> 33:40.143
No, just resting my eyes.

33:43.354 --> 33:45.356
It was more fun with all of us.

33:45.440 --> 33:48.693
Yeah. Grandpa always helped us
finish the tree.

33:48.776 --> 33:50.486
-You know what? You're right.
-Yep.

33:50.570 --> 33:52.947
-All right. Here we come.
Come on.
-Okay.

33:53.030 --> 33:56.159
-[Ralphie] The tree topper!
-It's not an angel.

33:56.242 --> 33:57.952
We always have an angel.

[Ralphie]
<i>Uh-oh. Better think fast.</i>

Uh-oh!

34:05.042 --> 34:06.419
Here. Honey, hold this,
will you?

34:06.502 --> 34:08.212
Kids, come over here
by Grandma. Come on.

34:13.843 --> 34:16.971
Here in Hohman,
it's star country.

34:17.054 --> 34:19.891
If you don't have a star,
you can forget about it.

34:19.974 --> 34:22.310
Santa won't even stop
by your house.

34:22.393 --> 34:23.728
Wait. Huh?

34:23.811 --> 34:25.396
[whispering] I'm improvising.

34:25.480 --> 34:27.440
Building new traditions.

34:27.523 --> 34:29.942
-It's good.
-Okay.

34:30.026 --> 34:31.360
No doubt about it.

34:32.236 --> 34:34.197
Around these parts...

34:34.280 --> 34:36.908
no star, no Christmas.

-[Ralphie]
<i>Come on, take the bait.</i>
-Mm.

Okay.

-[Sandy] Ralph,
we're leaving in 15.
-Okay.

34:56.385 --> 34:59.388
-[Sandy]
How's it going up here?
-Oh. Couldn't be better.

35:03.768 --> 35:04.977
Look at this.

35:05.061 --> 35:07.105
These obituaries
are so impersonal.

35:07.188 --> 35:10.233
Well, make it un-impersonal.

35:10.316 --> 35:13.694
This will be the last time
most folks ever
give him a thought.

35:13.778 --> 35:14.862
It's a lot of pressure.

35:14.946 --> 35:15.947
Yeah.

35:17.990 --> 35:20.284
If anyone can do it, it's you.

35:20.368 --> 35:23.204
-I gotta finish getting ready.
-All right.
I'll be down in a few.

35:23.287 --> 35:24.372
Okay.

Good afternoon.
Mr. Ralph Parker speaking.

Well, who were you expecting,
President Nixon?

[Ralphie]
<i>To everyone's amazement,</i>
<i>my kid brother, Randy,</i>

36:20.136 --> 36:22.054
<i>had done</i>

[Randy]<i> So I'm calling to see</i>

36:27.393 --> 36:29.270
Yeah, she said
you're on your way.

36:29.353 --> 36:32.899
[sighs] Look, Ralph, it's...

36:32.982 --> 36:36.903
it's not that easy getting
from India to Indiana.

36:36.986 --> 36:38.779
But you're working
on it, right?

36:38.863 --> 36:40.364
<i>Yeah. I'm at the airport.</i>

<i>a hit below the belt</i>
<i>is not only fair but necessary.</i>

36:57.381 --> 37:00.551
I think she is getting
her strength back.

37:00.635 --> 37:01.844
What does that mean?

37:01.928 --> 37:04.722
She finally ate something.
Thank God.

-Well, whose side are you on?

49:33.303 --> 49:35.305
Uh... me and Mark.

49:35.389 --> 49:38.058
-And you and Julie.
-[grunts, laughs]

49:38.141 --> 49:40.310
-Oh, you got it.
-[screams]

49:40.394 --> 49:42.062
-Come on, Mom!
-Stop. Take cover.

49:42.145 --> 49:43.563
Oh, God. Oh, God.

49:43.647 --> 49:45.273
-Now!
-[Mrs. Parker] Hey!

49:45.357 --> 49:48.485
Wait for me. Oh! [grunts]

49:48.568 --> 49:49.736
Back in the car, Ma!

49:50.404 --> 49:51.571
Oh, yeah.

49:51.655 --> 49:53.281
That's a good idea.

49:53.990 --> 49:55.409
[laughing]

49:58.578 --> 50:01.289
No, no, no.
Head for cover! Run!

50:01.373 --> 50:03.542
-I bet you can't hit me!
-Want to bet?

50:03.625 --> 50:05.419
-Yes, we can!
-No, you can't!

50:05.502 --> 50:07.462
[Ralphie] Oh, yeah? Watch this!

50:07.546 --> 50:08.964
Get 'em, Dad!

50:11.508 --> 50:14.052
[Ralphie]
<i>Oh, my God! I killed Julie!</i>

50:17.097 --> 50:20.350
-Dad, you ran three stop signs.
-Thank you, Mark.

50:21.143 --> 50:22.185
He is your dad.

50:22.269 --> 50:23.770
Everyone out, please.

50:23.854 --> 50:25.272
[Mrs. Parker] Ralphie.
[Ralphie] Come here. I got her.

50:25.355 --> 50:26.773
[Sandy] All right.
[Ralphie] She's fine.

50:26.857 --> 50:27.941
-Come on, honey.
-[Mrs. Parker] Are we home?

50:28.024 --> 50:29.234
No, Mom. We're at the hospital.

50:29.317 --> 50:30.610
Would you get
in the hospital, please?

50:30.694 --> 50:32.195
[Mark] Is she gonna
lose her eyeball?

50:32.279 --> 50:34.030
[Ralphie]
She's not losing anything.
Get inside.

50:34.114 --> 50:36.408
[Mark] You let her
have it. Pow!

50:36.491 --> 50:37.909
[Ralphie] Yes, I was there.
I saw.

50:37.993 --> 50:39.453
[Sandy] You'll be okay,
sweetheart.

50:39.536 --> 50:41.038
[Ralphie] She's fine.

50:41.121 --> 50:42.622
[snores]

50:42.706 --> 50:44.416
[soft Christmas music
playing on radio]

50:46.168 --> 50:49.546
[grunts]

50:58.221 --> 51:02.434
-Mark, it's not polite
to stare.
-Uh-huh.

51:02.517 --> 51:05.729
[snores, grunts]

51:06.980 --> 51:08.690
Oh. [chuckles]

51:08.774 --> 51:10.817
Would you look at that?

51:12.819 --> 51:14.571
I'm a Cyclops.

51:14.654 --> 51:18.283
[Sandy] Oh... Hey. Oh, oh.
[Mrs. Parker] Oh, honey.

51:18.366 --> 51:20.327
Come on, let's get you home.

51:20.410 --> 51:22.329
I'll put some Bactine on it.

51:22.412 --> 51:23.872
I'm so sorry, sweetheart.

51:23.955 --> 51:25.791
No, it's okay, honey.

51:25.874 --> 51:27.501
Because the doctor said
it's just gonna be
a couple of days, tops.

51:27.584 --> 51:28.919
Yeah. Better to be safe.

51:29.002 --> 51:30.587
We don't want anything
to get in that eye.

51:30.670 --> 51:33.465
-Like a snowball?
-[Ralphie grunts]

51:33.548 --> 51:35.550
Okay. Let's get you home. Okay?

51:35.634 --> 51:38.386
-We'll get you safe.
-Um, Ralph...

51:43.433 --> 51:45.060
[Mrs. Parker] Were we robbed?

51:45.143 --> 51:47.354
[Ralphie]
<i>My mind grappled</i>
<i>with the grim reality</i>

51:47.437 --> 51:51.191
<i>that every dollar we had set</i>
<i>aside for Christmas was spent!</i>

51:51.274 --> 51:54.152
<i>And now, just three days</i>
<i>before Christmas,</i>

51:54.236 --> 51:55.487
<i>what do we have to show for it?</i>

51:55.570 --> 51:58.949
<i>Nothing!</i>
<i>Not one stinkin' thing!</i>

51:59.032 --> 52:00.325
<i>The only upshot...</i>

52:01.243 --> 52:02.327
-That hurt?
-No.

52:02.410 --> 52:04.496
[Ralphie]<i> Our kids had no idea.</i>

52:07.082 --> 52:08.708
Son of a bitch.

52:08.792 --> 52:11.211
You got that right.

52:11.294 --> 52:13.880
-[typewriter clacking]
-[dog barking]

52:13.964 --> 52:16.299
[Ralphie]<i> Faced with</i>
<i>an impossible situation,</i>

52:16.383 --> 52:21.388
<i>I did what any good parent</i>
<i>would do in a time like this.</i>

52:21.471 --> 52:25.016
<i>Completely ignore the problem</i>
<i>and hope it goes away</i>
<i>on its own.</i>

52:27.269 --> 52:28.562
<i>Hey, Reuben. It's Ralph Parker.</i>

52:28.645 --> 52:30.146
I just wanted to call
and let you know

52:30.230 --> 52:32.482
that I'm close to completing
my follow-up manuscript.

52:32.566 --> 52:34.276
I can probably have it
wrapped up in a few days.

52:34.359 --> 52:36.319
So if you think it'll
make a difference--

52:36.403 --> 52:37.654
[Reuben]<i> Seeing as though</i>
<i>we haven't heard back</i>
<i>on the one.</i>

52:37.737 --> 52:39.489
-Nothing yet, huh?
<i>-Yeah.</i>

52:39.573 --> 52:41.658
Okay. Uh...

52:41.741 --> 52:44.953
Do you know if they received
the fruit basket I sent?

52:50.083 --> 52:53.086
I know. I know.
I'm getting to that.

52:53.169 --> 52:55.338
Ralph, I know you'll write
a great obituary.

52:55.422 --> 52:58.800
But right now,
we need to focus on Christmas.

52:58.884 --> 53:01.094
Yeah, I know.
I'd love nothing more.

53:01.177 --> 53:05.515
But I'm just a little hung up
on the monsters that stole
presents from our children.

53:05.599 --> 53:07.976
I had everything.
I had everything.
Every gift.

53:08.059 --> 53:09.936
You were a sight
to behold at Higbee's.

53:10.020 --> 53:11.813
I was. I really was.

53:11.897 --> 53:13.899
But then, you know,
we get into a snowball fight,
we're having fun,

53:13.982 --> 53:15.984
and then Mark says,
"Hey, I bet you can't
hit me from here!"

53:16.067 --> 53:17.986
-And then she just
came out of nowhere.
-Ralph...

53:18.069 --> 53:20.113
-I mean, I didn't see her.
She just sort of teleported.
-Ralph.

53:20.196 --> 53:23.450
Honey, everyone knows that
you did not try
to bean our daughter.

53:23.533 --> 53:25.285
[sighing] Man.

53:25.368 --> 53:26.494
This is, you know...

53:26.578 --> 53:29.623
My dad made this all
look so easy.

53:29.706 --> 53:31.583
Yeah, that's what
good parents do.

53:31.666 --> 53:34.419
But that doesn't mean
it was easy.

53:34.502 --> 53:36.296
So, look, I put together
all our cash

53:36.379 --> 53:38.131
and what we have left
of the Christmas fund

53:38.214 --> 53:41.968
and we can still
get the kids some presents.

53:42.761 --> 53:44.930
How much do we have?

53:45.013 --> 53:47.057
Including the change
from the ashtray...

53:48.558 --> 53:50.352
$21.17.

53:50.435 --> 53:52.771
[Ralphie]<i> Oh!</i>
<i>It was worse than I thought.</i>

53:52.854 --> 53:54.898
<i>Things had sunk to a new low,</i>

53:54.981 --> 53:59.402
<i>forcing us to attempt</i>
<i>the most delicate</i>
<i>of parental maneuvers...</i>

53:59.486 --> 54:02.238
<i>the lowering of expectations.</i>

54:02.322 --> 54:04.950
-[Julie] It's crazy.
-Hey, kids.

54:05.033 --> 54:08.828
So, this Christmas,
we thought it might be
really fun

54:08.912 --> 54:11.331
to focus a little more
on gratitude.

54:11.414 --> 54:12.374
Yeah.

54:12.457 --> 54:13.833
Wait, what's going on?

54:13.917 --> 54:15.961
[Ralphie]<i> That was fast.</i>

54:16.044 --> 54:18.046
Well, that's what
we wanted to talk about.

54:18.129 --> 54:22.550
Um, because Christmas
isn't really about how many
great gifts you get.

54:22.634 --> 54:24.177
-Oh, no.
-Isn't it?

54:24.260 --> 54:26.930
-[Ralphie]
<i>They're onto us.</i>
-No. It isn't, Mark.

54:27.013 --> 54:31.017
Because this is
part of Christmas, right?
And maybe the best part.

54:31.101 --> 54:32.686
Mm-hm.

54:32.769 --> 54:35.814
Yeah, all of us together,
enjoying delicious
home-cooked...

54:35.897 --> 54:37.023
food.

54:37.107 --> 54:38.191
[flies buzzing]

54:38.274 --> 54:40.026
[Ralphie]<i> Nice try, Sandy.</i>

54:40.110 --> 54:42.153
Are you saying we're
not getting presents,
just more casserole?

54:42.237 --> 54:43.530
[Ralphie] No, no, no.
[Sandy] No.

54:43.613 --> 54:46.241
What your mom
is trying to help me say

54:46.324 --> 54:48.785
-is that
there will be presents.
-Mm-hm.

54:48.868 --> 54:53.456
-Yeah.
-Just more likely
not the ones you wanted.

54:53.540 --> 54:55.208
Does this mean
Santa's not coming?

54:55.291 --> 54:57.627
[Ralphie]
<i>Bail out, bail out!</i>
<i>Eject, eject!</i>

54:57.711 --> 54:59.379
No, no. Of course he's coming.

54:59.462 --> 55:01.047
[Ralphie] Because
Santa always comes.
[Sandy] Yeah. Yeah.

55:01.131 --> 55:02.966
No, we just want you to keep
one thing in mind.

55:03.049 --> 55:06.428
[Ralphie]<i> Oh, please, please.</i>
<i>Don't say it.</i>

55:06.511 --> 55:08.138
It's the thought that counts.

55:08.221 --> 55:10.181
[Ralphie]<i> Oh, no! She said it!</i>

55:10.265 --> 55:13.393
<i>Kids can smell that stinker</i>
<i>from a mile away.</i>

55:13.476 --> 55:15.353
So, Christmas is gonna suck?

55:15.437 --> 55:18.648
I knew it! This means
I'm not getting a sled,
doesn't it?

55:18.732 --> 55:22.277
Okay, less attitude
and more gratitude, mister.

55:22.360 --> 55:23.570
[door closes]

55:23.653 --> 55:27.240
[sighs] Well, they certainly
got the message.

55:27.323 --> 55:29.909
Can you just go after Mark?

55:33.997 --> 55:35.040
Sorry.

55:41.880 --> 55:43.506
Wanna play Spades?

55:44.924 --> 55:46.342
One-Eyed Jacks?

55:47.719 --> 55:49.345
No, thanks, Grandma.

55:49.429 --> 55:51.931
I have something important
I need to figure out.

56:12.786 --> 56:14.537
Mark, let's go for a walk.

56:16.831 --> 56:17.916
Come on.

56:20.293 --> 56:21.628
Suds for Dad,

56:21.711 --> 56:23.213
Shirley Temple for the kid.

56:25.465 --> 56:26.925
To Christmas.

56:27.008 --> 56:28.343
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

56:28.426 --> 56:30.804
[Ralphie]<i> Ah, the genius</i>
<i>of the Shirley Temple.</i>

56:30.887 --> 56:36.267
<i>A few simple ingredients</i>
<i>that can make a kid feel like</i>
<i>he's one of the grown-ups.</i>

56:36.351 --> 56:38.186
[Flick] Oh, no, no. Ralphie.

56:38.269 --> 56:40.480
After the week you've had,
don't worry about it.
It's on the house.

56:40.563 --> 56:42.607
Whoa! Did I hear
"on the house"?

56:42.690 --> 56:45.610
-No, you didn't.
-[sighs]

56:45.693 --> 56:48.530
Hey, how's your
Christmas going, kid?

56:48.613 --> 56:50.281
It's okay, I guess.

56:50.365 --> 56:54.285
-I'm trying to focus
on gratitude.
-[confused grunts]

56:54.369 --> 56:56.579
That's real low, Ralph.

56:59.040 --> 57:00.917
Hey, Mark,
you ever bartend before?

57:01.000 --> 57:03.628
-I'm ten.
-Old enough. Come on back here.

57:03.711 --> 57:05.213
Have some fun. Come on.

57:07.590 --> 57:09.634
[dogs bark distantly]

57:14.472 --> 57:15.557
Any in here?

57:15.640 --> 57:17.350
Nope. Nothing.

57:20.770 --> 57:22.897
[dog whimpers]

57:26.985 --> 57:29.154
[gasps] Look at you.

57:31.114 --> 57:32.532
Hey. Come with me.

57:38.413 --> 57:39.831
[laughs]

57:47.922 --> 57:49.048
What do you want?

57:49.132 --> 57:51.467
I'm fixin' to feed the lobster.

57:51.551 --> 57:52.760
I found your puppy.

57:52.844 --> 57:55.430
She must have
gotten out somehow.

57:55.513 --> 57:56.931
What's your angle?

57:57.015 --> 58:00.768
If you want your adorable
little puppy back,

58:01.477 --> 58:02.770
I want a reward.

58:03.563 --> 58:05.565
What kinda reward?

58:08.401 --> 58:09.444
There you go.

58:09.527 --> 58:11.029
No way.

58:11.112 --> 58:12.238
Yup.

58:12.322 --> 58:13.406
You got it.
Just go right down there.

58:13.489 --> 58:15.658
Hey, thanks, kid.
You're all right.

58:15.742 --> 58:17.619
-[phone ringing]
-[all gasp]

58:17.702 --> 58:19.871
Mark, answer it. Go on.

58:22.040 --> 58:25.084
Hello? Mm-hm.

58:25.168 --> 58:27.587
Hold on. Let me check.
Is Junior here?

58:28.379 --> 58:30.173
Junior Kissel?

58:30.256 --> 58:31.674
-Junior Kissel?
-[mouthing] No.

58:33.176 --> 58:36.137
Junior Kissel?

58:36.221 --> 58:37.722
-[mouthing] No?
-[mouthing] No.

58:39.057 --> 58:40.225
No, I'm sorry, ma'am.

58:40.308 --> 58:41.893
There's no one here
named Junior.

58:42.977 --> 58:44.229
Mm-hm.

58:44.312 --> 58:46.022
Merry Christmas to you, too.

58:46.105 --> 58:47.190
[chuckles] Bye.

58:47.273 --> 58:48.441
[whistles]

58:48.524 --> 58:51.194
-Good job. You're great.
-[all cheering]

58:51.277 --> 58:53.696
-He's great.
-Your kid's a natural.

58:53.780 --> 58:55.073
Well done, kid.

58:55.156 --> 58:56.741
-There you go.
-Wow.

58:56.824 --> 58:59.786
Flick. Beer and a bag
of pork rinds.
Put it on my tab.

58:59.869 --> 59:01.246
No, out of pork rinds.

59:01.329 --> 59:03.414
Jeez. What kind of bar
runs out of pork rinds?

59:03.498 --> 59:06.167
Hey, you know, last week
they were out of corn nuts.

59:06.251 --> 59:08.795
[all laughing]

59:08.878 --> 59:12.131
It's the kind of bar
that floats a guy
who runs up a big tab

59:12.215 --> 59:14.300
while disrespecting the place.

59:14.384 --> 59:16.427
Whoa. I don't like your tone.

59:16.511 --> 59:18.471
[Ralphie]<i> Though he'd be</i>
<i>the last to admit it,</i>

59:18.554 --> 59:20.765
<i>deep down somewhere</i>
<i>in his inner core,</i>

59:20.848 --> 59:25.019
<i>Flick had it out for Schwartz</i>
<i>since that day</i>
<i>on the playground long ago.</i>

59:25.103 --> 59:27.814
And what kind of tone
would you prefer,
Your Highness?

59:27.897 --> 59:30.024
You know, you may be
a little more comfortable

59:30.108 --> 59:32.277
down the street
at The Knight Cap.

59:32.360 --> 59:34.362
-[all murmuring]
-The Knight Cap?

59:34.445 --> 59:38.491
[Ralphie]<i> The Knight Cap?</i>
<i>Ugh. Dante's lowest</i>
<i>circle of bars.</i>

59:38.574 --> 59:40.285
The Knight Cap?

59:41.619 --> 59:43.871
-Oh, you think?
-Yeah, maybe I do.

59:43.955 --> 59:45.290
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

59:45.373 --> 59:47.083
-Yeah? You're taking it back.
-Why would I?

you blowing smoke
up my dress like you did,

when we were kids...

Like my old man.

1:21:02.274 --> 1:21:06.778
But that day you handed
my ass to me...
I mean, that got me thinkin'.

[Ralphie]
<i>Not sure where this is going.</i>

1:21:09.114 --> 1:21:12.617

I put all that garbage
behind me.

1:21:12.701 --> 1:21:13.743

I'm one of the good guys.

1:21:17.706 --> 1:21:19.791
So I guess
what I'm saying is...

1:21:19.875 --> 1:21:20.959
I owe you, Parker.

Merry Christmas, Scut.

1:21:42.731 --> 1:21:45.984
You know, if anyone else but me
had answered that call,

1:21:46.067 --> 1:21:49.070
you'd be rotting
in a jail cell all weekend.

1:21:49.154 --> 1:21:50.322

1:22:45.669 --> 1:22:47.170
[Mrs. Parker] I miss him, too.

1:22:49.464 --> 1:22:50.965
But I know he's here.

1:22:54.886 --> 1:22:56.805
-[Ralphie groans]
-[Mrs. Parker sighs]

1:22:56.888 --> 1:23:00.392
-[Ralphie] I'll get the fuse.
-No. No. You go to bed.

1:23:00.475 --> 1:23:04.062
I've gotta learn to do
these things on my own
from now on.

1:23:04.145 --> 1:23:05.647
-I'll be fine.
-Okay.

1:23:05.730 --> 1:23:07.357
Okay, so, go. Go on.

1:23:07.440 --> 1:23:09.317
-I'm going up.
-Okay. All right.

1:23:09.401 --> 1:23:10.443
Be careful, Ma.

1:23:10.527 --> 1:23:11.653
Good night, Ralphie.

1:23:11.736 --> 1:23:12.779
Good night.

1:23:15.323 --> 1:23:16.574
[footsteps running]

1:23:16.658 --> 1:23:18.034
[both] Wake up!

1:23:18.118 --> 1:23:19.703
[screaming]

1:23:19.786 --> 1:23:21.746
-Come on, it's Christmas!
-There's presents
under the tree!

1:23:21.830 --> 1:23:24.040
We have to go see! Come on!

1:23:24.124 --> 1:23:25.959
-Okay, we're up, we're up.
-Okay, okay.

1:23:26.042 --> 1:23:27.919
-Hurry up!
-Faster!

1:23:29.546 --> 1:23:31.047
[gasps] Look, Julie!

1:23:31.131 --> 1:23:33.425
[screams] Daddy, Daddy,
you did it!

1:23:33.508 --> 1:23:36.261
-You got the star
and Santa came!
-[Mark] Look at it!

1:23:36.344 --> 1:23:38.680
-Is that a beer logo?
-[Mark] Awesome.

1:23:38.763 --> 1:23:40.306
Don't ask.

1:23:40.390 --> 1:23:43.059
-[laughs] Oh. Merry Christmas.
-[Sandy] Oh. Merry Christmas.

1:23:43.143 --> 1:23:44.936
-Merry Christmas, Ma.
-[Mark] He ate the cookies!

1:23:45.019 --> 1:23:47.313
-Good morning.
-[Julie] And the stockings
are full!

1:23:47.397 --> 1:23:49.691
-[both] Wow.
-Did you get extra presents?

1:23:49.774 --> 1:23:51.234
No. Did you?

1:23:51.317 --> 1:23:52.152
No.

1:23:53.111 --> 1:23:55.238
"For Ralph. Love, Dad."

1:23:56.030 --> 1:23:57.031
Oh.

1:23:59.993 --> 1:24:02.287
"For Julie. Love, Grandpa."

1:24:02.370 --> 1:24:03.246
[gasps]

1:24:05.874 --> 1:24:07.459
Mom, these are all from Dad.

1:24:08.376 --> 1:24:09.627
Yeah.

1:24:09.711 --> 1:24:12.380
Last night, when I was
down in the basement

1:24:12.464 --> 1:24:14.632
fixing the fuse, I found them.

1:24:15.884 --> 1:24:20.096
He must've got them before.

1:24:22.724 --> 1:24:25.810
Yeah. [chuckles] He did good.

1:24:25.894 --> 1:24:27.145
[Ralphie] Yeah.

1:24:28.730 --> 1:24:31.941
-[laughs] Well, come on!
Let's open gifts!
-[Ralphie] Yeah!

1:24:32.025 --> 1:24:35.487
[Ralphie]<i> Each of us,</i>
<i>in turn, opened the gifts</i>
<i>from my old man,</i>

1:24:35.570 --> 1:24:37.989
<i>marveling at their</i>
<i>thoughtful perfection.</i>

1:24:38.072 --> 1:24:39.616
An Easy-Bake Oven!

1:24:39.699 --> 1:24:42.076
-I can make Christmas
cookies today!
-[Ralphie] Yeah!

1:24:42.160 --> 1:24:43.495
It even has a pom-pom.

1:24:43.578 --> 1:24:45.497
-[Ralphie] Wow.
-Really pretty.

1:24:45.580 --> 1:24:47.999
-It is soft.
-Yeah.

1:24:48.082 --> 1:24:49.667
-[Sandy] Ah...
-Fountain pen.

1:24:49.751 --> 1:24:52.045
-Oh, lovely.
-Wow.

1:24:52.754 --> 1:24:53.588
Wow!

1:24:54.297 --> 1:24:56.132
[chuckles]

1:24:56.216 --> 1:24:59.511
A Flexible Flyer F-23
Yankee Clipper!

1:24:59.594 --> 1:25:00.804
How did he know?

1:25:00.887 --> 1:25:03.723
He knows. He always knows.

1:25:03.807 --> 1:25:07.560
<i>And right when it seemed</i>
<i>the only thing missing</i>
<i>was the old man,</i>

1:25:07.644 --> 1:25:12.232
<i>he was here,</i>
<i>just like always,</i>
<i>on Christmas morning.</i>

1:25:14.150 --> 1:25:16.402
[Ralphie] Whoa! Look at that.
[Sandy] Oh, you are...

1:25:16.486 --> 1:25:18.196
Oh, boy.

1:25:18.279 --> 1:25:20.156
[Ralphie]<i> We tore</i>
<i>into the remaining</i>
<i>presents with abandon.</i>

1:25:20.240 --> 1:25:23.159
See, now your papa can't
hit you in the eyes anymore.

1:25:23.243 --> 1:25:24.744
It was an accident.

1:25:24.828 --> 1:25:26.955
[Ralphie]<i> Some were from</i>
<i>Mom's stockings from Santa,</i>

1:25:27.038 --> 1:25:30.583
<i>and the rest from Sandy's</i>
<i>ingenious use of</i>
<i>our remaining cash.</i>

1:25:30.667 --> 1:25:31.876
It's a party calendar.

1:25:31.960 --> 1:25:33.419
[Ralphie] Disco.
[Sandy] Disco.

1:25:33.503 --> 1:25:35.088
[Mrs. Parker] Disco. Yeah.
[Ralphie] Look at that.

1:25:37.131 --> 1:25:39.551
<i>No one cared how much</i>
<i>they cost, because...</i>

1:25:39.634 --> 1:25:42.178
<i>and I can't believe</i>
<i>I'm admitting this,</i>

1:25:42.262 --> 1:25:44.180
<i>it was the thought that counts.</i>

1:25:44.264 --> 1:25:46.808
[Sandy] He's gonna break
his other arm, too.
[Ralphie] Yeah. He just might.

1:25:46.891 --> 1:25:49.894
-And, Dad,
I have something for you.
-Oh.

1:25:49.978 --> 1:25:51.396
[chuckles]

1:25:51.479 --> 1:25:53.356
-Ooh.
-The gifts are great.

1:25:53.439 --> 1:25:55.149
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

1:25:55.233 --> 1:25:57.318
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

1:25:58.736 --> 1:25:59.988
[Mrs. Parker] Oh.

1:26:00.071 --> 1:26:02.740
-[laughing]
-[Sandy] What?

1:26:03.658 --> 1:26:05.493
Oh. A radiator.

1:26:05.577 --> 1:26:07.745
-Where did you--
-I blackmailed Delbert.

1:26:07.829 --> 1:26:10.540
-It was easy.
-[chuckles] That's my girl.

1:26:12.584 --> 1:26:14.127
Thank you, sweetheart.

1:26:14.210 --> 1:26:16.045
I love it.

1:26:16.129 --> 1:26:18.923
-[Ralphie]<i> Delbert Bumpus.</i>
<i>The gift that keeps on giving.</i>
-Oh, my God.

1:26:25.889 --> 1:26:27.348
I can't wait.

1:26:27.432 --> 1:26:29.183
Me neither.

1:26:29.267 --> 1:26:31.686
[Mrs. Parker] Not until
the casseroles are finished.

1:26:31.769 --> 1:26:33.104
[groans]

1:26:33.187 --> 1:26:35.607
[laughs] Come on, let's go.
Two plates, two forks.

1:26:35.690 --> 1:26:37.192
-Off you go.
-You serious?

1:26:37.275 --> 1:26:39.193
I'm serious.
Out you go. Come on.

1:26:39.277 --> 1:26:40.778
Put some meat
on those bones. Go on.

1:26:40.862 --> 1:26:42.488
-[Julie] It never ends.
-I know, I know.

1:26:47.744 --> 1:26:48.870
[Sandy sighs]

1:26:51.247 --> 1:26:54.208
You know, I've been thinking.

1:26:54.292 --> 1:26:56.961
I mean, a year, it really
isn't that much time.

1:26:57.045 --> 1:26:59.839
-And to build
a writing career--
-No, honey.

1:27:00.548 --> 1:27:01.841
A deal's a deal.

1:27:01.925 --> 1:27:03.551
And it was a real gift.

1:27:03.635 --> 1:27:06.471
But come January,
I'm going back to work.

1:27:07.096 --> 1:27:08.306
And that's okay.

1:27:09.474 --> 1:27:10.642
Okay.

1:27:31.955 --> 1:27:36.334
[Ralphie]
<i>It wasn't the lack of success</i>
<i>that bothered me.</i>

1:27:36.417 --> 1:27:38.878
<i>It was the sting</i>
<i>that laid in the belief</i>

1:27:38.962 --> 1:27:42.173
<i>that I still had something</i>
<i>meaningful to say.</i>

1:27:44.717 --> 1:27:45.885
[woman] Ralphie!

1:27:46.886 --> 1:27:48.137
Great job!

1:27:50.598 --> 1:27:51.808
Okay.

1:27:57.021 --> 1:27:58.356
[man] Hey, Ralphie!

1:27:58.439 --> 1:27:59.857
The wife and I
loved your story.

1:28:00.817 --> 1:28:01.859
The newspaper.

1:28:03.444 --> 1:28:04.487
It's great!

1:28:30.388 --> 1:28:32.557
It's my story.

1:28:32.640 --> 1:28:34.434
How did they get my story?

1:28:34.517 --> 1:28:35.560
Don't look at me.

1:28:38.062 --> 1:28:39.731
I gave it to 'em.

1:28:39.814 --> 1:28:41.566
What are you talking about?

1:28:41.649 --> 1:28:43.985
Well, last night,
after you stormed out,
the newspaper called.

1:28:44.068 --> 1:28:46.446
They wanted the obituary
for the Sunday paper.

1:28:46.529 --> 1:28:49.949
So, I borrowed your mom's car
and I dropped it off.

1:28:50.033 --> 1:28:51.367
It's not an obituary.

1:28:51.451 --> 1:28:55.121
No, I know.
The editor said the same thing.

1:28:55.204 --> 1:28:59.208
Ralph, I read it.
It's the best thing
you've ever written.

1:29:01.377 --> 1:29:02.962
And besides,
I wasn't about to give them

1:29:03.046 --> 1:29:06.382
the lousy three sentences
you scribbled on that notepad.

1:29:06.466 --> 1:29:08.468
-[phone ringing]
-Oh, I'll get it.

1:29:10.553 --> 1:29:13.181
Hello? Yes.

1:29:13.264 --> 1:29:14.682
Yes, he's here.

1:29:14.766 --> 1:29:15.767
It's for you.

1:29:15.850 --> 1:29:16.768
Who is it?

1:29:16.851 --> 1:29:18.811
It's the editor from the paper.

1:29:25.234 --> 1:29:26.235
Hello?

1:29:27.361 --> 1:29:28.279
Uh-huh.

1:29:29.072 --> 1:29:30.156
Yes.

1:29:30.239 --> 1:29:32.742
Yes, I do. All right.

1:29:34.368 --> 1:29:36.579
Okay. Mm-hm.

1:29:39.373 --> 1:29:40.458
Thank you.

1:29:46.422 --> 1:29:48.591
Well, what did he say?

1:29:51.511 --> 1:29:54.263
He wants to know
if I have more stories.

1:29:59.185 --> 1:30:00.353
Ralph...

1:30:01.562 --> 1:30:03.064
You did it.

1:30:03.147 --> 1:30:05.233
I did it. I did it!

1:30:05.316 --> 1:30:07.318
-[all laughing]
-I did it.

1:30:08.820 --> 1:30:11.030
<i>I did. I actually did it!</i>

1:30:11.114 --> 1:30:13.991
<i>I was a bona fide</i>
<i>published writer!</i>

1:30:14.075 --> 1:30:15.409
<i>And they wanted more!</i>

1:30:15.493 --> 1:30:18.621
-[indistinct chatter]
-[knocking on door]

1:30:18.704 --> 1:30:21.916
-I'll get it!
-He also said it's gonna
be syndicated.

1:30:21.999 --> 1:30:23.334
-What?
-What does that mean?

1:30:23.417 --> 1:30:25.336
It means it's going
in all the papers.

1:30:25.419 --> 1:30:27.004
-Even in Chicago?
-Yeah.

1:30:27.088 --> 1:30:29.507
Come on. Let's go read it!

1:30:29.590 --> 1:30:32.009
-Ralph.
-[Julie] Wait for me!

1:30:32.093 --> 1:30:34.387
-Thank you, honey.
-Of course.

1:30:34.470 --> 1:30:37.265
-[Mrs. Parker] Ralphie,
you have visitors.
-Go, go, go!

1:30:37.348 --> 1:30:38.683
-Okay. Okay.
-Go!

1:30:38.766 --> 1:30:39.976
Who is it, Ma?

1:30:40.059 --> 1:30:42.770
There he is!
Hohman's own Ray Bradbury!

1:30:42.854 --> 1:30:44.647
Oh, man! Good job.

1:30:44.730 --> 1:30:47.733
-Hey! Yeah, good stuff, man.
-Thanks, buddy.

1:30:47.817 --> 1:30:48.985
Mom loved it.

1:30:49.068 --> 1:30:50.653
-Had me read it to her twice.
-Wow.

1:30:50.736 --> 1:30:53.030
-Thanks for the story, Ralph.
-Hey, Larry.

1:30:53.114 --> 1:30:55.449
Great excuse to get
out of the house.

1:30:55.533 --> 1:30:56.617
-Yeah.
-Oh, yeah.

1:30:56.701 --> 1:30:59.036
How do you feel
about casserole?

1:30:59.120 --> 1:31:01.289
-I love it.
-You must be hungry.

1:31:01.372 --> 1:31:02.373
Casserole.

1:31:02.456 --> 1:31:03.541
-Let's eat!
-Come on.

1:31:03.624 --> 1:31:05.877
Merry Christmas, everybody!

1:31:05.960 --> 1:31:09.088
[Ralphie]<i> As the word</i>
<i>spread, it seemed like half</i>
<i>the neighborhood showed up.</i>

1:31:09.172 --> 1:31:11.883
<i>My mother welcomed them</i>
<i>with open arms...</i>

1:31:11.966 --> 1:31:14.093
<i>as long as they</i>
<i>weren't carolers.</i>

1:31:14.177 --> 1:31:15.970
-You digging in?
-Ralph.

1:31:16.053 --> 1:31:17.138
[indistinct chatter]

1:31:18.973 --> 1:31:20.850
-No, it's not true.
-Officer Farkus...

1:31:20.933 --> 1:31:22.393
Hey! What's all the fuss?

1:31:22.476 --> 1:31:23.895
[all] Oh, Randy!

1:31:24.770 --> 1:31:26.731
-Randy!
-Mom!

1:31:28.691 --> 1:31:30.151
Oh.

1:31:30.234 --> 1:31:32.278
-Hey! Merry Christmas,
big brother.
-You made it.

1:31:32.361 --> 1:31:34.572
Yeah. A cracker?

1:31:34.655 --> 1:31:36.073
Mm-hm.

1:31:36.157 --> 1:31:39.368
-[both] Uncle Randy!
-Hey, runts! How are you doing?

1:31:39.452 --> 1:31:41.078
Good to see you.
Good to see you.

1:31:41.162 --> 1:31:43.122
Hey, why don't you go check out
that suitcase over there.

1:31:43.206 --> 1:31:45.416
I picked up some gifts
along the way.

1:31:45.500 --> 1:31:46.709
-Sandy!
-Randy!

1:31:46.792 --> 1:31:49.086
-Hey.
-Hey. Merry Christmas.

1:31:49.170 --> 1:31:51.797
[gasps] It's the stuffed cat
I wanted!

1:31:51.881 --> 1:31:52.798
Oh.

1:31:52.882 --> 1:31:55.259
Cool! A saber.

1:31:55.343 --> 1:31:56.594
-Awesome!
-Oh.

1:31:56.677 --> 1:31:58.429
[Mrs. Parker] No, no, no.

1:31:58.512 --> 1:32:00.598
[sniffs] What's that smell?

1:32:00.681 --> 1:32:02.058
Casserole. Come on, let's eat.

1:32:02.141 --> 1:32:03.434
-What, on Christmas?
-Let's go. Go.

1:32:03.518 --> 1:32:05.269
Come on. We need some dishes.

1:32:05.353 --> 1:32:08.814
Extra chairs. Come on,
everybody. Come on.

1:32:08.898 --> 1:32:12.443
[Ralphie]
<i>Everyone gathered 'round,</i>
<i>rolled up their sleeves,</i>

1:32:12.527 --> 1:32:14.320
<i>and loosened</i>
<i>their belts a notch.</i>

1:32:14.403 --> 1:32:17.281
<i>Those casseroles</i>
<i>didn't stand a chance.</i>

1:32:17.365 --> 1:32:20.660
