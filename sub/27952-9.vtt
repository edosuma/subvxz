WEBVTT

00:06.256 --> 00:09.509
A sweet slice of orange
for my sweet papito.

00:13.805 --> 00:14.681
Really, Mami?

00:15.724 --> 00:17.559
If you always do everything for him,

00:17.642 --> 00:20.061
he'll never be able
to do anything for himself.

00:20.812 --> 00:22.355
-I'm fine with that.
-I'm fine with that.

00:23.982 --> 00:25.191
Come on, Lupita.

00:25.275 --> 00:28.403
Life has been torture for Papito
since he has been imprisoned.

00:28.486 --> 00:29.821
Grounded.

00:29.904 --> 00:31.990
Imprisoned in this house.

00:32.615 --> 00:34.576
And all because he wanted
to spend some time

00:34.659 --> 00:36.578
with some girl named Mary Jane.

00:39.706 --> 00:42.375
No, it's fine, Abuelita.
I need to learn my lesson.

00:42.459 --> 00:44.419
How you doing
with that list of chores I gave you?

00:44.502 --> 00:46.087
I'm almost done with all of them.

00:49.049 --> 00:51.885
You're still working on this?
We have eight more units to get through.

00:51.968 --> 00:54.429
The green wire is extra.
Don't need to connect it to anything.

00:54.512 --> 00:57.849
Isn't that the wire that trips the breaker
if there's a power surge?

01:02.145 --> 01:02.979
Carry on.

01:05.231 --> 01:06.775
Why you so stressed?

01:06.858 --> 01:08.860
Your aromatherapist out of town?

01:10.236 --> 01:12.572
Well, that's not helping, but no.

01:13.323 --> 01:14.824
I'm worried about Father's visit.

01:14.908 --> 01:17.744
I am really curious to meet your dad.

01:17.827 --> 01:20.538
I picture the rich Monopoly guy.

01:21.122 --> 01:22.707
No, that's my Uncle Doug.

01:24.834 --> 01:27.754
God! Father's visit is stressing me oot!

01:29.339 --> 01:31.049
I haven't seen him
since before I got sober.

01:31.132 --> 01:33.176
Haven't you been sober
for, like, eight years?

01:33.259 --> 01:35.637
Yeah, I'm not his favorite child.

01:36.846 --> 01:39.808
Plus, he refused to come back to America
till it was great again.

01:44.521 --> 01:47.482
I have a feeling your father's going
to make me want to take my earrings out

01:47.565 --> 01:48.983
and punch him in the throat.

01:50.360 --> 01:52.028
Oh, definitely.

01:52.821 --> 01:54.322
But please just roll with it.

01:54.405 --> 01:55.782
All I want is to get through this

01:55.865 --> 01:57.742
and give him as little as possible
to criticize.

01:57.826 --> 02:00.954
That's why I poured my blood, sweat,
and tears into fixing up the building.

02:01.496 --> 02:02.455
I did all that.

02:03.456 --> 02:06.960
You made me patch up the drywall
'cause you had just gotten a manicure.

02:08.128 --> 02:09.921
Father says
you can tell the quality of a man

02:10.004 --> 02:11.673
by the health of his cuticles.

02:12.340 --> 02:15.385
A real man does not know
what a cuticle is.

02:17.137 --> 02:18.972
Anyway, I think he'll like the building,

02:19.055 --> 02:21.266
but my real ace in the hole is Avery.

02:21.349 --> 02:23.143
He'll love her
'cause she's rich and beautiful,

02:23.226 --> 02:25.812
but he won't want to date her
because she's over 30.

02:31.860 --> 02:34.028
Oh, and please don't make fun of me

02:34.112 --> 02:36.322
when he calls me
by my childhood nickname, Goldie,

02:36.406 --> 02:37.615
short for Golden Boy.

02:38.700 --> 02:40.368
That's actually kind of sweet.

02:40.451 --> 02:41.786

and dress like American Psycho?

I always knock. I'm the landlord.
It's a courtesy.

04:03.409 --> 04:05.703
[groans] Did you join a cult again?

04:07.789 --> 04:12.335
Everyone, I'd like you to meet my father,
Lawrence Fitzgerald Schneider.

04:15.129 --> 04:17.090
Very nice to finally meet you.

04:17.173 --> 04:18.132
You must be Avery.

04:18.216 --> 04:19.217
-No.
-Oh, no,

04:19.300 --> 04:22.011
Avery's meeting us here in a minute.
This is my tenant, Penelope.

04:22.095 --> 04:22.929
Oh.

04:23.721 --> 04:24.597
Thank god.

04:26.683 --> 04:28.518
Encantada.

04:28.601 --> 04:30.228
Ah, una Española.

04:30.311 --> 04:32.021
Mucho gusto en conocerla.

04:32.355 --> 04:34.232
Your Spanish is very good.

04:34.607 --> 04:36.109
Escobar was an old friend.

04:38.611 --> 04:40.238
Such a shame what happened.

04:42.740 --> 04:44.325
Hi, I'm Alex.

04:44.784 --> 04:45.618
Nice suit.

04:45.702 --> 04:47.078
Oh, thank you.

04:47.161 --> 04:48.621
A little boy like you made it for me.

04:59.340 --> 05:02.051
So this is what
a typical unit looks like, huh?

05:04.554 --> 05:05.555
Much better.

05:06.639 --> 05:11.352
Looks like you two were about to check out
our new, top-of-the-line laundry room.

05:11.436 --> 05:12.603
Run along now.

05:13.313 --> 05:15.231
And don't give me that rent late.

05:16.482 --> 05:19.068
Oh, I almost forgot.
I brought you something.

05:19.861 --> 05:23.906
Oh! Uh, that's so thoughtful of you, sir,

05:23.990 --> 05:26.242
but I'm sober now. Remember?

05:26.993 --> 05:29.078
But this is Don Julio Real.

05:29.662 --> 05:32.165
He's got his own house.

05:36.502 --> 05:37.545
It's still alcohol.

05:39.547 --> 05:40.381
[knocking on door]

05:40.465 --> 05:42.967
Ooh, this must be Avery.
You're gonna love her.

05:45.303 --> 05:47.263
Now that's more like it.

05:48.431 --> 05:49.432
Ah!

05:51.934 --> 05:52.935
Mr. Schneider,

05:53.019 --> 05:54.979
-it's such a pleasure to meet you.
-Likewise.

05:55.063 --> 05:58.024
You know, I met your father
at the Bohemian Grove a while back.

05:58.107 --> 06:00.610
Oh, dear! Was he orchestrating
The Cremation of Care?

06:00.693 --> 06:02.028
As ever. [chuckles]

06:02.111 --> 06:04.989
And we were also dueling skippers
at the Mackinac Regatta.

06:05.073 --> 06:06.741
Ah! Daddy once lost a Mackinac wager

06:06.824 --> 06:09.869
when his forestay snapped
and his catamaran tacked starboard.

06:09.952 --> 06:13.331
Ironically, it cost him his holdings...
in Pingtang!

06:13.414 --> 06:16.250
[both laugh]

06:17.251 --> 06:18.252
What the hell?

06:21.464 --> 06:22.757
-Shall we?
-Yeah.

06:25.385 --> 06:26.511
Was that even English?

06:28.054 --> 06:30.223
No, that was cha-ching-lish.

06:34.143 --> 06:36.312
Oh, what happened?

06:39.941 --> 06:42.068
Everything is so different.

06:42.151 --> 06:43.945
Yeah, they replaced the old machines

06:44.028 --> 06:46.447
that shook so hard
they moved across the room.

06:47.949 --> 06:50.284
Pero that's how I knew
that the spin cycle was over.

06:51.202 --> 06:54.163
They came up and smacked me on the nalgas.

06:56.332 --> 06:58.918
It reminded me of your abuelo.
[giggles]

07:00.378 --> 07:03.005
[dryer plays tune]

07:03.840 --> 07:06.676
Schneider programmed them
to play different songs when they're done.

07:06.759 --> 07:08.928
Don't quit your day job, dryer.

07:10.847 --> 07:15.101
Okay, and where do I put the quarters?

07:15.184 --> 07:16.561
You pay with your phone.

07:20.898 --> 07:22.400
So dumb!

07:22.733 --> 07:23.609
[Alex chuckles]

07:24.444 --> 07:26.404
You'll get used to it, Abuelita.

07:26.487 --> 07:28.448
Remember when you thought
rays from the microwave

07:28.531 --> 07:29.949
would give Elena chest hair?

07:31.742 --> 07:32.910
We shall see.

07:34.954 --> 07:38.207
Ay, your mother never empties her pockets.

07:41.586 --> 07:43.296
Y qué es esto?

07:45.131 --> 07:50.303
Uh... Looks like a pen set
and some catnip.

07:51.929 --> 07:55.224
[gasps] Dios mío! It is las drogas.

07:58.102 --> 08:00.271
No! Why do you think that's drug stuff?

08:00.354 --> 08:02.648
I think someone's been writing letters
to a cat.

08:04.066 --> 08:06.903
No. No, no, no, it is the vape.

08:06.986 --> 08:09.780
I have seen it many times
on Caso Cerrado.

Oh! Yes! [gasps]

08:23.211 --> 08:25.171
Mami! [sobs]

08:26.172 --> 08:28.508
Oh, hey, I was just showing Father
the new sconces.

08:28.591 --> 08:30.635
Oh! Did you try to pull on it

08:30.718 --> 08:32.887
to open up the secret entrance
to the treasure room?

08:32.970 --> 08:34.222
[chuckles]

08:34.305 --> 08:35.765
That's all Bluetooth now.

08:37.266 --> 08:39.227
But this is all very nice.

08:39.310 --> 08:40.978
Impressive renovations,

08:41.062 --> 08:42.813
and you did it
with your cuticles intact...

08:42.897 --> 08:44.106
like a man.

08:45.066 --> 08:45.900
I'm proud of you.

08:45.983 --> 08:46.859
[gasps]

08:47.443 --> 08:49.111
You've never said that to me before.

08:49.195 --> 08:50.154
You deserve it, son.

08:50.238 --> 08:51.113
[gasps]

08:51.739 --> 08:53.616
You've never called me son before.

08:54.951 --> 08:56.077
You finally earned it.

Hey, what's cracking, you old queen?

09:07.129 --> 09:09.257
Wow! He was almost not awful.

09:09.340 --> 09:10.341
I know!

09:10.424 --> 09:12.051
And he loves the building.

09:12.134 --> 09:13.511
[gasps] What did he like?

09:13.594 --> 09:15.805
The tankless water heater,
the new mailbox hardware?

09:15.888 --> 09:17.348
Tell me everything.

09:17.431 --> 09:19.433
He was very impressed
with all your hard work.

09:21.018 --> 09:23.312
You told him you did everything yourself,
didn't you?

09:23.396 --> 09:24.313
He's my daddy!

09:26.524 --> 09:28.401
Plus, he loved Avery.

09:28.484 --> 09:29.860
And not in the bad way.

09:29.944 --> 09:32.196
He said she'd make
a great first or fifth wife.

09:32.280 --> 09:33.739
That's the highest compliment.

09:35.283 --> 09:36.576
How is that a compliment?

09:36.659 --> 09:38.244
Well, the first wife is for breeding,

09:38.327 --> 09:40.580
the second is for spite,
the third is to forget the second,

09:40.663 --> 09:42.999
the fifth is 30 years younger
so it circles back to breeding,

09:43.082 --> 09:45.126
and of course, traditionally,
the fourth wife's Asian.

09:48.129 --> 09:48.963
I'm...

09:50.590 --> 09:51.841
I'm just so tired.

09:55.344 --> 09:59.265
Anyway, Father said it was ingenious
that I picked the neighborhood when I did,

09:59.348 --> 10:01.350
because property values
have gone through the roof.

10:01.434 --> 10:04.520
That's not a great thing, Schneider.
It's gentrification.

10:04.604 --> 10:05.646
No!

10:05.730 --> 10:09.150
This isn't gentrification. That's bad.
This is good. Everything's worth more.

10:10.109 --> 10:12.987
Yes, property values go up for the owners,

10:13.070 --> 10:16.198
but businesses and working-class people
get pushed out of their own neighborhoods

10:16.282 --> 10:18.034
because they can't afford rent anymore.

10:18.743 --> 10:20.119
That's the best news of all.

10:20.202 --> 10:22.955
You won't be paying rent anymore,
because...

10:23.831 --> 10:26.375

Are you serious?

10:46.812 --> 10:49.482
Oh, my God! I did this.

10:49.940 --> 10:52.193
All of my work contributed
to gentrification.

10:52.276 --> 10:53.986
I'm the white devil!

10:59.200 --> 11:01.702
I thought you were just trying
to get through this.

11:01.786 --> 11:03.663
Now you're selling the building?
What happened?

11:03.746 --> 11:06.374
I know,
but Father and I got to talking,

11:06.457 --> 11:08.250
and he said a lot of things
that made sense,

11:08.334 --> 11:11.671
and then he said this is something
that we could work on together.

11:12.463 --> 11:14.799
I've been waiting for this my entire life.

11:14.882 --> 11:18.636
Well, a bunch of hard-working families
are gonna be out on the street.

11:18.719 --> 11:21.931
But I'm glad that you and your daddy
have a little project.

11:22.014 --> 11:24.183
Why are you mad?
This is gonna be great for you.

11:24.266 --> 11:27.269
You can own your own home,
but the monthly payments will be the same.

11:27.353 --> 11:29.814
I don't have enough money
for a down payment.

11:30.481 --> 11:31.941
I buy Target furniture!

11:32.316 --> 11:33.359

11:36.112 --> 11:38.823
Just get one of those loans
where you don't have to put anything down

11:38.906 --> 11:39.949
and you only pay interest.

11:40.032 --> 11:41.617
You mean the loans that broke America?

11:41.701 --> 11:42.576
When was this?

11:42.660 --> 11:43.494
Wow!

11:44.203 --> 11:45.579
Look, you're a veteran.

Can't you get a special loan?

Or don't they, like, give you houses?
They should give you houses.

11:51.293 --> 11:53.129
You have no idea
how the world actually works.

11:54.422 --> 11:56.424
This is really gonna affect us.

11:58.008 --> 11:59.468
But you obviously don't care.

12:00.094 --> 12:01.554
[sighs] Of course I do.

12:03.222 --> 12:04.932
But I have to do this.

12:06.809 --> 12:07.643
Right.

12:10.271 --> 12:12.064
You know, you can learn Spanish.

12:12.815 --> 12:14.316
You can eat dinner with us.

12:14.942 --> 12:16.986
You can pretend you're part of the family.

12:17.528 --> 12:19.029
But when it comes down to it,

12:19.613 --> 12:23.033
you are still the man
and we're just your tenants.

12:23.492 --> 12:25.202
Come on, Penelope. That's not at all--

12:25.286 --> 12:26.537
No, congratulations.

12:28.956 --> 12:30.332
You are your father's son.

12:31.333 --> 12:32.293
Get out.

12:37.631 --> 12:39.717
-Penelope--
-No, I mean it. Please, get out.

that Lupe is on the wacky weed.

13:02.239 --> 13:03.574
Get me a fried egg

13:03.657 --> 13:06.577
so I can show her
what a brain looks like on drugs!

13:08.370 --> 13:11.624
I am never going to stop yelling at her!

13:13.542 --> 13:15.377
Or... you can say nothing.

13:15.461 --> 13:16.545
[sighs exasperatedly]

13:17.171 --> 13:18.005
Quiet mad.

13:19.256 --> 13:20.883
That's the worst kind of mad.

13:22.885 --> 13:24.220
Si.

13:26.847 --> 13:30.518
A silent Cuban is the deadliest of Cubans.

13:32.102 --> 13:33.479
But first...

13:33.562 --> 13:35.314
I yell!

13:35.397 --> 13:37.650
And I give her such a pow pow!

13:40.736 --> 13:41.987
Abuelita, it's mine.

13:42.738 --> 13:43.572
Huh?

13:44.824 --> 13:45.866
What?

13:46.742 --> 13:47.827
It's my weed.

13:49.036 --> 13:52.164
Mom found it in my room
and must have left it in her pocket.

13:54.625 --> 13:56.585
Is this why you have been grounded?

13:58.045 --> 13:58.879
Yeah.

14:01.215 --> 14:04.176
Mami has been hiding it from you
because I asked her to.

14:06.512 --> 14:08.013
I just didn't want to let you down.

14:11.225 --> 14:13.227
I'm so sorry, Abuelita.

14:19.233 --> 14:20.818
Abuelita, say something.

14:27.783 --> 14:28.909

14:29.952 --> 14:33.372
Thanks again for going through
all my stuff on such short notice.

14:33.455 --> 14:36.250
You can account on me,
'cause I'm an accountant.

14:37.251 --> 14:39.461
That used to be on my business card.
I took it off.

14:39.545 --> 14:40.379
That's good.

14:41.547 --> 14:43.674
[sighs]

14:44.133 --> 14:46.635
I'm feeling kind of vulnerable
showing you all my finances.

14:46.719 --> 14:48.220
That's, like, 12th base.

14:48.304 --> 14:49.763
Twelfth base?

14:49.847 --> 14:52.725
You're either really bad at baseball
or really good at sex.

14:52.808 --> 14:54.560
Okay, Mateo, focus.

14:55.644 --> 14:57.479
Can I afford to buy this place?

14:57.771 --> 14:58.606
[Mateo exhales]

14:59.523 --> 15:03.360
I'm sorry, but even with your VA benefits,
you'll be stretched pretty thin.

15:03.444 --> 15:05.863
Especially with Elena going off
to college next year.

15:06.906 --> 15:07.740
Great.

15:08.240 --> 15:10.451
We can't afford to live in Echo Park
without rent control,

15:10.534 --> 15:14.204
which means we're gonna have to move,
the kids are gonna have to switch schools,

15:14.288 --> 15:15.748
and I'll have a six-hour commute.

15:15.831 --> 15:17.708
Maybe we live in the car
'cause Mami is small.

15:18.500 --> 15:20.336
And I'll just start pumping Alex
with coffee now

15:20.419 --> 15:21.962
so he doesn't have another growth spurt.

15:22.046 --> 15:24.298
Penelope, calm down.

15:24.632 --> 15:26.175
You're actually in pretty good shape.

15:26.258 --> 15:28.135
You can still afford to live in LA.

15:28.218 --> 15:29.887
Let's take a look at your expenses.

15:30.888 --> 15:33.682
Do you always see yourself living
with your mother?

15:33.766 --> 15:36.143
Come on. You really gotta ask me that?
We're Latinos.

15:36.727 --> 15:39.146
She lives with me.
I'll live with the Elena.

15:39.229 --> 15:42.483
We'll just keep passing on that curtain
and I'll figure out a way to like cats.

15:44.318 --> 15:45.861
[sighs]

15:47.696 --> 15:49.782
I could kill Schneider for doing this.

15:51.033 --> 15:53.327
Plus, jail would be a free place to live.

15:54.995 --> 15:56.956
Look, I get why you're mad.

15:57.414 --> 15:59.792
But you see how much
this neighborhood has changed

15:59.875 --> 16:01.377
and I see how little rent you pay.

16:01.794 --> 16:03.837
Has Schneider ever raised your rent?

16:04.421 --> 16:05.422
Not since we moved in.

16:05.506 --> 16:08.759
You've been paying the same rent
for 17 years? He's a saint.

16:09.468 --> 16:11.720
But yeah, screw that guy. Let's kill him.

16:14.223 --> 16:16.517
Well, I took down the man.

16:16.600 --> 16:19.019
I slightly loosened all the sconces.

16:19.103 --> 16:22.231
And I wrote "colonizer scum"
on the wall outside!

16:22.314 --> 16:23.649
In chalk!

16:26.235 --> 16:27.319
Go wipe that off right now.

16:27.403 --> 16:28.278
Okay!

16:30.823 --> 16:32.533
Abuelita, say something.

16:33.742 --> 16:34.827
Anything!

16:37.037 --> 16:38.330
Tell me one of your stories.

16:38.414 --> 16:40.374
Here, I'll even get you started.

16:40.457 --> 16:42.543
[imitating Lydia] Havana, 1952...

How can I make this better?

16:49.425 --> 16:50.259
I'll do anything.

16:50.342 --> 16:53.887
I'll clean the house every day.
I'll let you pick out all my clothes.

16:53.971 --> 16:55.014
I'll even shave my head.

16:55.097 --> 16:56.223
[gasps] Ay, no.

16:57.725 --> 16:59.101
Gracias a Dios.

16:59.560 --> 17:02.187
Papito, you should have known better.

17:02.271 --> 17:04.648
I am very disappointed in you.

17:06.233 --> 17:07.735
I'm really sorry, Abuelita.

17:09.361 --> 17:10.446
It was a mistake.

17:11.822 --> 17:13.198
And I'll never do it again.

17:18.537 --> 17:19.747
I did it too.

17:25.127 --> 17:26.045
What?

17:26.128 --> 17:27.254
The marijuana.

17:29.298 --> 17:32.468
I, too, rode the green dragon.

17:35.304 --> 17:36.221
Oh!

17:36.305 --> 17:38.265
Is that why you were staring at the dryer?

17:38.348 --> 17:43.228
No, I accidentally ate
one of Leslie's pot lozenges,

17:43.312 --> 17:46.815
and I became very...
Como se dice?

17:46.899 --> 17:47.816
...lit.

17:50.569 --> 17:51.528
Wait.

17:52.154 --> 17:53.614
You got high?

17:53.697 --> 17:55.157
I got real high, baby.

17:56.825 --> 17:58.827
And it was stupid.

17:59.453 --> 18:01.205
And we must promise each other

18:01.288 --> 18:04.708
that we will never ever, ever, ever

18:04.792 --> 18:07.586
toss the devil's salad again.

18:10.631 --> 18:13.133
We need to work on your slang, Abuelita.

18:14.593 --> 18:15.427
But okay.

18:21.100 --> 18:23.644
[sniffles]

18:27.856 --> 18:28.941
Don't cry.

18:29.817 --> 18:32.653
-I said I'll never do it again.
-No, no, it's not that.

18:33.445 --> 18:37.157
This is the first time
you have ever kept a secret from me,

18:37.574 --> 18:39.409
and we don't do that.

18:39.493 --> 18:42.162
We keep secrets from everyone else.

18:44.748 --> 18:47.126
You know how we hide the good cookies
in the oatmeal tin?

18:48.794 --> 18:50.629
And how you are the only person

18:50.712 --> 18:55.425
who knows I killed Elena's hermit crab
with Fabuloso.

19:00.639 --> 19:02.266
-I will take that to my grave.
-Ay.

19:03.350 --> 19:04.393
Thank you.

and it makes me a little sad.

-Yes, I will.
-Yeah?

19:38.177 --> 19:40.012

we can get stoned together.

of leaving my apartment when asked.

that polite, Canadian crap

you'd know that you put me
through rehab five times.

you loved me.
