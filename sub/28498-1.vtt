00:23.161 --> 00:25.163
Early this morning,

00:25.956 --> 00:29.235
you came knocking
on my door.

00:29.236 --> 00:32.479
"Hello, Satan," I said.

00:32.479 --> 00:35.931
"I believe it's time
to go."

00:35.932 --> 00:41.213
The two of us,
walking side-by-side.

00:42.007 --> 00:44.940
You gonna bury my body

00:44.941 --> 00:47.943
down by the highway-side.

00:47.944 --> 00:52.016
So my old evil spirit

00:52.017 --> 00:54.399
can catch a Greyhound bus...

00:55.400 --> 00:57.574
and ride.

01:10.035 --> 01:12.141
Happy 27, Quinn.

01:13.763 --> 01:15.316
You're a legend.

01:36.613 --> 01:39.616
Don't think I didn't see you
snag my coke, Brenda.

02:03.709 --> 02:04.709
Fuck...

02:17.896 --> 02:21.692
This music is the siren call

02:21.693 --> 02:23.764
of the devil himself.

02:25.214 --> 02:26.904
Polluting our children.

02:26.905 --> 02:29.355
Offering base gratification

02:29.356 --> 02:33.359
in exchange for
their eternal souls.

02:33.360 --> 02:35.947
It gives hope
to the devil to know

02:35.948 --> 02:39.675
that so many people are
willing to hand over their shot

02:39.676 --> 02:42.954
at eternal life
with Jesus Christ...

02:42.955 --> 02:45.233
in exchange for being the idols

02:45.234 --> 02:48.236
these other lost souls worship.

02:48.237 --> 02:53.827
There is a special
place in hell

02:53.828 --> 02:58.523
for those who take
what is meant for the Lord.

03:02.182 --> 03:03.251
One, two, three, four!

03:14.987 --> 03:16.056
Fuck.

03:29.278 --> 03:32.280
Oh, now you're up.

03:32.281 --> 03:34.282
As soon as I want some privacy,

03:34.283 --> 03:36.388
you pricks spring
right into action.

03:38.873 --> 03:41.012
Go home, assholes.

03:49.332 --> 03:50.747
I said get the fuck...

05:27.050 --> 05:30.398
Quinn Scott, your debt is due.

05:30.399 --> 05:33.262
I'll kill her. I'll kill her,
I swear I'll do it.

05:33.263 --> 05:35.852
Your time has passed.

06:01.188 --> 06:02.603
Quinn.

06:03.984 --> 06:05.399
Quinn, what are you doing?

06:07.297 --> 06:09.472
Fuckhead, wake...

06:09.886 --> 06:11.440
Quinn!

06:18.861 --> 06:19.862
Quinn?

06:27.628 --> 06:28.732
Fuck.

06:28.733 --> 06:29.733
Asshole.

06:43.299 --> 06:45.611
Lily. Lily, hey, hey.

06:45.612 --> 06:47.406
We got to go. We got to go.

06:47.407 --> 06:48.717
We got to go right now.

06:48.718 --> 06:51.100
Get up. We got to go.
Get up. We got to go.

08:54.223 --> 08:56.881
I can hear your phone
buzzing through the door.

09:06.235 --> 09:07.269
Oh!

09:07.270 --> 09:10.031
Or it could have been
your vibrator buzzing.

09:10.032 --> 09:11.204
Who's to say?

09:11.205 --> 09:13.482
I got in late
after the show last night.

09:13.483 --> 09:15.070
And then I put in
a full night of editing.

09:15.071 --> 09:16.865
I need you to come with me
over to Jenny's place.

09:16.866 --> 09:18.349
For the last time, man,

09:18.350 --> 09:21.076
I'm not gonna have a threesome
with you and your girlfriend.

09:21.077 --> 09:24.632
But Jenny and your mom,
that's still on the table.

09:24.633 --> 09:26.357
You are way too old
for my mom, man.

09:26.358 --> 09:27.980
Jenny's way too old for you.

09:27.981 --> 09:29.775
Hey, fuck you, man.
She's hot.

09:29.776 --> 09:31.604
Her sister's over there
being dramatic.

09:31.605 --> 09:32.950
If you show up with me,
they'll just...

09:32.951 --> 09:35.263
- Cut it short.
- Fine.

09:35.264 --> 09:37.059
- Buy you a coffee?
- Thanks.

09:38.336 --> 09:39.612
- A latte.
- Oh, fuck you.

09:39.613 --> 09:40.856
Well...

09:44.549 --> 09:47.586
Local music fans have
gathered today to pay tribute

09:47.587 --> 09:49.691
to rock 'n' roll
star Quinn Scott.

09:49.692 --> 09:52.314
The charismatic frontman
of the band Saturn's Return

09:52.315 --> 09:54.869
who died last night
in the building behind me

09:54.870 --> 09:57.734
after celebrating achieving
platinum record status

09:57.735 --> 10:00.150
on what was his
27th birthday.

10:00.151 --> 10:02.186
An autopsy is
currently being conducted.

10:02.187 --> 10:04.464
And while it may take
several weeks for authorities

10:04.465 --> 10:06.259
to determine
the actual cause of death,

10:06.260 --> 10:09.815
focus has already been brought
to the notorious 27 Club

10:09.816 --> 10:12.127
into which Quinn Scott
is tragically...

10:12.128 --> 10:14.095
- Hey.
- ...the most recent inductee.

10:14.096 --> 10:16.960
- What's going on over there?
- Quinn Scott died.

10:16.961 --> 10:19.066
I just saw him
perform last night.

10:20.620 --> 10:21.759
Hey.

10:22.345 --> 10:23.830
We really got to go.

10:24.865 --> 10:26.832
Oh, this would be
perfect for my doc.

10:26.833 --> 10:28.627
Wow, that's your reaction?

10:28.628 --> 10:31.284
Come on, man. You got to admit.
The timing's super nuts.

10:31.285 --> 10:34.494
He was just joking about the
curse at his show last night.

10:34.495 --> 10:37.395
This makes Quinn Scott the
newest member of the 27 Club.

10:39.259 --> 10:40.811
So?

10:40.812 --> 10:43.745
So? Robert Johnson,
Amy Winehouse,

10:43.746 --> 10:45.609
Kurt Cobain, Janis Joplin,

10:45.610 --> 10:47.231
Jimi Hendrix, Jim Morrison.

10:47.232 --> 10:48.405
And now Quinn Scott?

10:48.406 --> 10:49.648
There's got to be a connection.

10:49.649 --> 10:51.719
Yeah, they're all the same age.

10:51.720 --> 10:53.341
No, it goes
way deeper than that.

10:53.342 --> 10:55.999
Quinn Scott is just
the most recent to be taken.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.759
Jimi Hendrix, OD'd on pills

10:57.760 --> 11:01.038
and one of his roadies claims his
manager confessed to murdering him.

11:01.039 --> 11:03.696
Janis Joplin, OD's on heroin

11:03.697 --> 11:05.733
right before releasing
her biggest hit song.

11:05.734 --> 11:07.666
Jim Morrison dies
of heart failure.

11:07.667 --> 11:10.669
His corpse was wrapped in
plastic and packed in dry ice

11:10.670 --> 11:12.222
for three days
before being reported.

11:12.223 --> 11:14.914
Kurt Cobain dies from
a shotgun blast to the head.

11:14.915 --> 11:16.847
Murder allegations
have been documented,

11:16.848 --> 11:18.953
but never
properly investigated.

11:18.954 --> 11:21.334
Amy Winehouse died
of alcohol poisoning.

11:21.335 --> 11:24.648
Her family and management burns
through her $10 million estate

11:24.649 --> 11:25.684
in under two years.

11:25.685 --> 11:27.547
Robert Johnson, the original.

11:27.548 --> 11:30.033
He suffered for three days straight
before dying of strychnine poisoning

11:30.034 --> 11:31.482
from a bottle of whiskey.

11:31.483 --> 11:33.899
Any one of their deaths could
have easily been a murder.

11:33.900 --> 11:35.970
Yeah, yeah. Murder, suicide.

11:35.971 --> 11:38.006
Maybe they were
dragged to hell!

11:38.007 --> 11:39.801
- Anything's possible.
- All right, let's go.

11:39.802 --> 11:40.940
We got to get going to Jenny's,

11:40.941 --> 11:42.424
I really wanna get
this thing over with.

11:42.425 --> 11:43.771
You can come back later.

11:43.772 --> 11:45.049
- Come on.
- Okay, all right.

11:46.395 --> 11:48.568
You can't keep
scaring me like this

11:48.569 --> 11:49.880
and expect me
to forget about it.

11:49.881 --> 11:53.194
Would you dial back
the shrill mom tone

11:53.195 --> 11:55.092
just a little bit?

11:55.093 --> 11:56.991
If you keep getting
blackout drunk,

11:56.992 --> 11:58.647
you're gonna get
really hurt one day.

11:58.648 --> 12:00.546
I was with Caleb.

12:00.547 --> 12:03.273
That shithead. He left you
passed out in front of my door.

12:03.274 --> 12:05.000
I'm in one piece.

12:05.794 --> 12:06.967
Hey, guys.

12:08.106 --> 12:09.142
Coffee?

12:10.005 --> 12:11.384
Thanks.

12:11.385 --> 12:13.352
Lily, what happened this time?

12:13.353 --> 12:14.388
Nothing.

12:16.321 --> 12:17.357
She's fine.

12:18.116 --> 12:19.738
Mmm.

12:19.739 --> 12:21.601
You guys know
I have a show tonight?

12:21.602 --> 12:23.603
Cool. Where is it?

12:23.604 --> 12:24.881
At the Panic Room.

12:24.882 --> 12:26.261
It'd be great
if you guys could come.

12:26.262 --> 12:28.401
We got to play to
a full house, right?

12:28.402 --> 12:30.645
I thought you said
those guys don't like you.

12:30.646 --> 12:32.095
Caleb likes me,

12:32.096 --> 12:34.683
and he owns all their gear.

12:34.684 --> 12:36.893
He said I could sing tonight.

12:36.894 --> 12:38.826
Is he your boyfriend?

12:38.827 --> 12:40.689
When required.

12:41.830 --> 12:44.348
Can you give me
a ride to my place?

12:44.349 --> 12:46.626
We're going to brunch
in the opposite direction.

12:46.627 --> 12:48.491
We're already pretty late, too.

12:49.596 --> 12:50.734
I can walk you home.

12:50.735 --> 12:52.081
It's on my way.

13:18.694 --> 13:20.005
Hey, Professor Crawford.

13:20.006 --> 13:21.282
How's the project going?

13:21.283 --> 13:24.457
Um, Quinn Scott
died last night.

13:24.458 --> 13:25.665
He just turned 27.

13:25.666 --> 13:27.875
That's helpful for you,
I suppose.

13:27.876 --> 13:30.636
This could be the thing that really
pushed this project over the edge.

13:30.637 --> 13:31.879
I hope so.

13:31.880 --> 13:34.122
Do you think these
connections are real?

13:34.123 --> 13:36.297
More and more,
as I keep researching.

13:36.298 --> 13:39.265
Uh, the only thing I haven't done
is communicate with the dead.

13:39.266 --> 13:41.716
Interesting. That might
be worth a try.

13:41.717 --> 13:44.099
But that would be
entirely your decision.

13:44.996 --> 13:47.170
I wouldn't even
know where to start.

13:47.171 --> 13:49.103
Anything else
before I go?

13:49.104 --> 13:52.141
Um, yeah. Maybe one question.

13:52.797 --> 13:54.694
Do you believe in the curse?

13:54.695 --> 13:56.489
I believe in you, Jason.

13:56.490 --> 13:59.527
You've got the opportunity to
do something really great here.

13:59.528 --> 14:01.150
Keep up the good work.

14:03.773 --> 14:05.602
Professor?

14:05.603 --> 14:06.983
Hey, can you hear me?

14:06.984 --> 14:08.502
Something? Anything?

14:09.883 --> 14:11.298
Ah, forget it.

15:54.332 --> 15:56.748
All right,
are you guys ready to rock?

15:58.785 --> 16:00.855
Ladies and gentlemen,

16:00.856 --> 16:04.515
may I introduce Vile Descent!

16:05.481 --> 16:07.827
And for the first time
on vocals...

16:07.828 --> 16:10.623
Lily Glance!

16:13.524 --> 16:16.458
Are you fuckers
ready to get crazy?

16:18.701 --> 16:21.703
Lily! Yeah!

16:21.704 --> 16:22.773
Asshole.

16:22.774 --> 16:26.053
I know you can do
better than that.

16:26.054 --> 16:27.571
Show us your tits.

16:27.572 --> 16:31.023
I bet you wanna hear "Free Bird,"
too, you fucking douchebag.

16:31.024 --> 16:33.129
No, I just wanted
to see your tits.

16:33.130 --> 16:34.958
He's wasted.

16:34.959 --> 16:36.511
Yeah, that makes two of us.

16:36.512 --> 16:38.997
Hey, can we just start the show?
Let's start the show!

16:38.998 --> 16:41.171
All right, everybody.
Thanks for coming out.

16:41.172 --> 16:42.897
My name is Lily Glance.

16:42.898 --> 16:45.106
And these are
my lady singers!

16:45.107 --> 16:47.523
She has the attitude.
If only she had the talent.

16:56.429 --> 16:58.638
- I cannot watch this.
- What?

17:04.126 --> 17:06.334
I cannot watch this.
We're going.

17:10.580 --> 17:12.030
Let's go.

17:22.972 --> 17:26.423
Thanks, fuckers.
I actually wanted a whiskey.

17:26.424 --> 17:28.115
You know what? We're done.
And you're done.

17:28.116 --> 17:30.532
Everyone, Lily's first
and last performance.

17:31.188 --> 17:32.981
- You're out. Go.
- Yeah!

17:36.158 --> 17:37.470
Get out of here.

17:38.816 --> 17:40.335
Get the fuck out of here.

17:48.136 --> 17:50.068
Yeah, sorry about that,
everybody. Fuck them.

17:50.069 --> 17:52.518
Is there, uh... Do we got a
bass player in the house, man?

17:52.519 --> 17:53.864
Just take this pussy
out of here.

17:53.865 --> 17:55.832
We need one bass player.

17:57.593 --> 17:59.939
All right, well, "The show must
go on," as they say, right?

17:59.940 --> 18:01.493
We are Vile Descent.

18:01.494 --> 18:04.047
First song is called
"We Are Slaves."

18:04.048 --> 18:06.395
Let's get crazy.

18:08.915 --> 18:10.468
<i>♪ We are slaves</i>

18:11.159 --> 18:12.677
<i>♪ We are slaves</i>

18:13.161 --> 18:14.714
<i>♪ We are slaves</i>

18:15.853 --> 18:17.441
<i>♪ We are slaves</i>

18:18.097 --> 18:19.304
<i>♪ We are slaves</i>

18:36.977 --> 18:39.013
Caleb, get back here.

18:39.014 --> 18:40.187
Come on.

18:40.188 --> 18:42.189
Every time, man. Every time.

18:42.190 --> 18:43.673
- Come on.
- What? What?

18:43.674 --> 18:46.641
Hey, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean what I said.

18:46.642 --> 18:48.298
All right?
I'll do whatever it takes.

18:48.299 --> 18:50.611
Those guys are never gonna
let me live this down, ever.

18:50.612 --> 18:51.613
Do you understand?

18:52.303 --> 18:54.132
You don't need those guys.

18:54.133 --> 18:55.927
You're so much
better than them.

18:57.101 --> 18:58.274
Turn off your dick, dude.

18:58.275 --> 18:59.585
You guys should
make your own band.

18:59.586 --> 19:01.794
Maybe one day you guys
could open for us.

19:01.795 --> 19:02.968
Yeah, fuck you!

19:02.969 --> 19:04.212
Keep dreaming, bitch.

19:06.214 --> 19:07.490
It's not working out,
all right?

19:07.491 --> 19:09.562
You made me look stupid,
do you understand?

19:11.564 --> 19:13.875
There's nothing... There's nothing
you can do to make it up to me.

19:13.876 --> 19:15.326
All right? You're done.

19:17.535 --> 19:18.536
What?

19:19.848 --> 19:21.952
Look, doesn't mean we're done.

19:21.953 --> 19:25.716
You mean we can, like,
keep hooking up or whatever?

19:27.407 --> 19:29.960
Yeah. Whatever you want.

19:29.961 --> 19:31.238
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

19:31.239 --> 19:33.343
Anything.

19:33.344 --> 19:35.138
Fuck her!

19:35.139 --> 19:37.278
You're such an asshole.

19:38.901 --> 19:41.283
- Later, bitches.
- Hey, that's my stuff. That's my shit.

19:43.803 --> 19:45.322
Hey! Fuck!

19:48.463 --> 19:50.741
Hey,
are you okay?

19:51.155 --> 19:52.398
Jason?

19:54.538 --> 19:55.642
Sorry.

19:57.265 --> 19:58.887
Those guys are jerks.

19:59.922 --> 20:01.648
Zane and Jenny split?

20:01.959 --> 20:03.202
Yeah.

20:03.685 --> 20:05.307
Can't blame 'em.

20:06.377 --> 20:07.895
You weren't that bad.

20:10.070 --> 20:11.347
Thanks, I guess.

20:11.348 --> 20:13.971
You were right.
They were playing too slow.

20:16.560 --> 20:18.112
Right?

20:18.113 --> 20:21.461
I mean, I may have
been a little off.

20:22.324 --> 20:24.463
But they sucked tonight.

20:24.464 --> 20:26.327
And the best part is
I have it all recorded

20:26.328 --> 20:28.156
so you can analyze it later.

20:28.157 --> 20:29.330
No!

20:29.331 --> 20:31.643
No, you were not
filming that shit show.

20:31.644 --> 20:34.991
Yeah, yeah, I was
filming that shit show.

20:34.992 --> 20:36.337
For my documentary.

20:36.338 --> 20:38.822
About shitty local bands?

20:38.823 --> 20:41.412
The 27 Club. You know it?

20:42.379 --> 20:45.484
Yeah. That's cool.

20:45.485 --> 20:48.246
Who's your favorite member?
Is it Amy Winehouse?

20:48.247 --> 20:50.801
You have some of the same
tattoos that she does.

20:51.146 --> 20:52.457
Good eye.

20:52.458 --> 20:54.907
My favorite is Robert Johnson.

20:54.908 --> 20:56.184
He's the first rock 'n' roller

20:56.185 --> 20:58.359
to ever be inducted
into the club.

20:58.360 --> 21:00.017
They say he made
a deal with the devil.

21:00.776 --> 21:02.260
Pretty crazy, right?

21:02.261 --> 21:03.952
I've tried that
a couple times.

21:05.194 --> 21:08.473
As witnessed tonight,
it did not work.

21:08.474 --> 21:10.820
Do you think
it's all coincidence?

21:10.821 --> 21:13.305
I mean, there's plenty
of people who've made it big

21:13.306 --> 21:15.203
that didn't die at 27.

21:15.204 --> 21:17.136
Yeah, but the musicians
who died at 27

21:17.137 --> 21:20.105
seem to represent their
generation in a significant way.

21:20.106 --> 21:22.728
They perpetuate this
"live fast, die young" fantasy

21:22.729 --> 21:25.248
that most people are
too afraid to go after.

21:25.249 --> 21:27.492
I'd gladly call it
life at 27

21:27.493 --> 21:29.942
if it meant I had
half the success Amy had.

21:29.943 --> 21:31.185
Yeah?

21:31.186 --> 21:34.153
You don't think that sounds
like a selfish thing to say?

21:34.154 --> 21:36.846
I mean, we're all
gonna go sometime.

21:36.847 --> 21:39.297
I want a life
that people remember.

21:39.298 --> 21:41.816
She gave herself
to us completely.

21:41.817 --> 21:44.716
And now we have
her music forever.

21:44.717 --> 21:48.445
It's not a selfish dream,
it's a generous one.

21:50.239 --> 21:52.275
That was great.

21:52.276 --> 21:55.969
Would you mind if you said that
again and I put it on tape?

21:56.763 --> 21:58.385
Right now?

21:58.386 --> 22:00.526
- Yeah.
- Not a good time.

22:01.458 --> 22:03.044
I still want to
interview you, though.

22:03.045 --> 22:05.392
I think it'd make
a great addition to the film.

22:05.393 --> 22:07.842
I do need
a musician's perspective.

22:07.843 --> 22:09.741
Look, I know you're
into me or whatever,

22:09.742 --> 22:12.331
but...
I'm no Amy.

22:13.366 --> 22:15.679
Well, maybe not yet.

22:17.094 --> 22:18.405
But neither was she.

22:18.406 --> 22:20.786
Until she was.

22:20.787 --> 22:23.825
Clock's ticking on that.
I'm already 26.

22:26.275 --> 22:27.552
Can I buy you
a drink somewhere?

22:27.553 --> 22:29.624
- How about three?
- Okay.

24:31.262 --> 24:34.333
If there was a better way
to wash off a bad night,

24:34.334 --> 24:35.956
I haven't found it yet.

24:35.957 --> 24:37.096
Cheers.

24:41.272 --> 24:43.135
Why are you, uh...

24:43.136 --> 24:45.863
Why are you making
a documentary on the 27 Club?

24:46.450 --> 24:48.071
I've always loved music.

24:48.072 --> 24:52.697
You know, it's the closest thing
you can get to real magic on earth.

24:52.698 --> 24:55.216
Like, when you hear,
like, a really great song

24:55.217 --> 24:57.425
and it does something to you

24:57.426 --> 24:59.636
that you never would
have felt without it.

25:02.742 --> 25:05.158
So why don't you pick up
the guitar or something?

25:06.159 --> 25:08.436
I tried. I was awful.

25:08.437 --> 25:12.062
Yeah, my only hope would've been
making a deal with the devil, too.

25:15.375 --> 25:16.583
But, uh, yeah.

25:16.584 --> 25:19.102
So I'm just taking it
for this, uh,

25:19.103 --> 25:21.449
independent study program
over the summer.

25:21.450 --> 25:23.279
Just figured I would
channel my energy

25:23.280 --> 25:25.662
into something that
I'm actually passionate about.

25:26.352 --> 25:28.009
All right, Mr. Passion.

25:28.699 --> 25:31.459
Give me 40 bucks.

25:31.460 --> 25:36.361
Is this for the interview that
you're gonna give me later?

25:36.362 --> 25:37.950
It's a start.

25:47.269 --> 25:48.305
Excuse you.

26:03.665 --> 26:05.010
Is everything okay?

26:05.011 --> 26:07.669
Fine. How's your relationship
with your drug dealer?

26:08.636 --> 26:10.326
You know, I think
I've seen him before.

26:10.327 --> 26:11.741
Really? You know Derek?

26:11.742 --> 26:13.640
I wouldn't say I know him.

26:13.641 --> 26:15.125
Lucky you.

26:23.409 --> 26:24.754
Ooh!

26:26.757 --> 26:28.276
That's better.

26:29.933 --> 26:30.934
Your turn.

26:42.670 --> 26:44.672
Oh, my God.

26:48.607 --> 26:49.884
What?

27:12.389 --> 27:13.873
I feel like dancing.

27:14.667 --> 27:16.186
I don't dance.

27:17.152 --> 27:18.359
You do now.

28:06.961 --> 28:08.756
Do they know that girl?

28:09.170 --> 28:10.205
What?

28:13.622 --> 28:15.003
There was a girl.

28:15.624 --> 28:16.832
A girl?

28:16.833 --> 28:19.455
Yeah. They were leaving.

28:19.456 --> 28:21.181
You can't leave yet.

28:21.182 --> 28:22.321
Let's keep dancing.

28:36.680 --> 28:38.061
Okay.

28:50.798 --> 28:52.247
Let me put this down.

29:19.861 --> 29:22.414
Here. Put this on.

29:22.415 --> 29:23.830
Okay. Okay.

29:23.831 --> 29:25.315
- Hurry up.
- I'll be right back.

29:35.359 --> 29:39.122
I make love to thousands
of people every night.

29:41.676 --> 29:44.264
And then I go home alone.

29:44.265 --> 29:46.749
Now, that doesn't sound fair
to me, does it?

29:49.822 --> 29:52.962
You know, nobody who
ever saw me perform

29:52.963 --> 29:55.447
had to go home alone.
They each...

29:55.448 --> 29:57.864
took a piece of me with them.

29:57.865 --> 29:59.867
Whether they knew it or not.

30:01.800 --> 30:04.319
One day, I'll have
nothing left to lose.

30:06.666 --> 30:08.841
No more love to give.

30:11.085 --> 30:12.949
And then I'll be free.

30:14.882 --> 30:17.263
They might move on
to the next one,

30:18.851 --> 30:20.819
but they'll never forget me.

30:43.669 --> 30:45.084
Shit.

30:48.812 --> 30:50.055
- Hi.
- Hey.

30:55.819 --> 30:58.683
- Did we, uh...
- I don't know.

30:58.684 --> 31:00.030
I hope we didn't.

31:00.582 --> 31:02.653
Oh, yeah. Me, too.

31:04.586 --> 31:06.449
I know you probably think

31:06.450 --> 31:08.866
that it doesn't make sense
for us to be together.

31:08.867 --> 31:12.111
But I think we
can still try.

31:16.978 --> 31:18.911
Please, just leave.

31:26.263 --> 31:28.438
I don't think I want
to be in your movie.

31:28.921 --> 31:30.715
What?

31:30.716 --> 31:32.096
You saw the show.

31:32.097 --> 31:33.926
No one wants to hear
what I have to say.

31:34.858 --> 31:36.894
And this feels weird.

31:36.895 --> 31:39.000
I didn't think it was that bad.

31:39.794 --> 31:41.691
I think you're amazing.

31:41.692 --> 31:44.316
Just think about it.

31:44.937 --> 31:47.456
The interview, I mean.

31:47.457 --> 31:49.217
- What's that?
- What?

31:49.838 --> 31:51.081
Nothing.

31:55.741 --> 31:56.879
The notebook.

31:56.880 --> 31:58.605
Oh...

31:58.606 --> 32:01.608
That's just, um,
something that I'm using for my project,

32:01.609 --> 32:04.266
but you're no longer
interested in it anymore,

32:04.267 --> 32:06.407
so can I have it
back, please?

32:10.998 --> 32:14.035
Um, yeah. Sure.

32:17.038 --> 32:18.384
Okay, um...

32:19.282 --> 32:21.180
I'm just gonna
get dressed outside.

32:31.535 --> 32:32.915
Hey, dude.

32:32.916 --> 32:35.987
Show me the video of Lily getting
booed offstage last night.

32:35.988 --> 32:37.816
Jenny made us leave
before it was over.

32:37.817 --> 32:39.163
That shit was hilarious.

32:39.164 --> 32:41.475
Not now, man.
I'm trying to get some work done.

32:41.476 --> 32:42.718
Come on, I wanna see it.

32:42.719 --> 32:44.513
Dude, it wasn't
even that funny.

32:44.514 --> 32:45.721
Are you defending her?

32:45.722 --> 32:47.481
She's a good person.

32:49.070 --> 32:51.071
How well do you know her?

32:51.072 --> 32:53.005
Better than you think.

32:54.144 --> 32:56.214
Wait a minute,
did you hook up with her?

32:56.215 --> 32:58.147
Why would you even say that?

32:58.148 --> 32:59.838
I knocked on
your door this morning,

32:59.839 --> 33:00.908
you weren't here.

33:00.909 --> 33:02.256
You never stay out.
What happened?

33:04.361 --> 33:05.637
Nothing.

33:05.638 --> 33:07.743
I mean, I stayed at her place,
but it's nothing like that.

33:07.744 --> 33:09.193
Oh, my God, you did!

33:09.194 --> 33:11.989
Congratulations,
you've joined the club

33:11.990 --> 33:13.991
of the 27 other guys
she's currently banging.

33:13.992 --> 33:16.959
What's that supposed to mean?

33:16.960 --> 33:19.065
It's just a pretty easy score,
no offense.

33:19.066 --> 33:20.514
How would you know?

33:20.515 --> 33:21.792
What is that?

33:22.724 --> 33:24.070
Oh, shit.

33:24.071 --> 33:25.657
That's what I'm researching.

33:25.658 --> 33:28.212
I think it's instructions
for summoning a demon.

33:28.213 --> 33:29.868
Do you speak Mexican?

33:29.869 --> 33:32.526
Mexican isn't a language,
it's Spanish.

33:32.527 --> 33:35.840
But even that's wrong
because you're looking at Latin.

33:35.841 --> 33:38.291
I see Mexico, senor.

33:38.292 --> 33:40.569
- Where?
- Speak it. Let's summon this demon.

33:40.570 --> 33:42.398
Let's hope it's not Lily.

33:42.399 --> 33:44.367
- Ugh.
- Summon this shit.

33:55.792 --> 33:57.104
Hey.

33:57.552 --> 33:59.105
Hey, man.

33:59.106 --> 34:01.141
Are you the manager?

34:01.142 --> 34:04.386
No. Sorry, dude.
Just the checkout person.

34:04.387 --> 34:05.801
Why, you got to complain
or something?

34:05.802 --> 34:08.493
Actually, I was just wondering
if you guys had this

34:08.494 --> 34:09.701
on CD.

34:09.702 --> 34:12.118
The Very Best of Everclear.

34:12.119 --> 34:13.842
Deep shit, huh?

34:13.844 --> 34:16.156
First of all, fantastic choice.

34:16.157 --> 34:18.123
Vinyl's awesome, obviously,

34:18.125 --> 34:19.746
but I was thinking
it might be cool

34:19.746 --> 34:23.129
to, like, listen to these
tracks in my friend's car.

34:23.130 --> 34:24.647
Maybe download it?

34:24.648 --> 34:27.202
And lose that vintage sound
of the original?

34:27.203 --> 34:29.445
Yeah, well, we only
have it on vinyl here,

34:29.446 --> 34:32.069
so maybe check at
Goodwill or something.

34:32.070 --> 34:33.380
I think they stock CDs.

34:33.380 --> 34:36.728
I know a little bit about vinyl.
Mind if I have a look?

34:36.728 --> 34:38.351
Uh, sure, man.

34:39.387 --> 34:40.699
Everclear.

34:41.527 --> 34:42.768
What's your name?

34:42.770 --> 34:44.081
Bladen.

34:44.978 --> 34:46.393
Bladen.

34:46.393 --> 34:48.257
Sleeve's in good shape.

34:49.259 --> 34:50.880
Let's check the vinyl.

34:53.263 --> 34:55.851
There's something wrong
with this one.

34:55.851 --> 34:58.234
The vinyl is broken.

34:59.166 --> 35:00.752
Dude, this guy's hardcore.

35:00.753 --> 35:02.099
Here, Bladen.

35:02.100 --> 35:04.792
Stooges, Damned...

35:06.069 --> 35:07.449
Quinn Scott.

35:07.450 --> 35:09.347
Much better than the Everclear.

35:09.348 --> 35:11.178
Oh, and by the way.

35:12.213 --> 35:14.559
This, too. None of that's
any good without it.

35:14.560 --> 35:16.975
Now go poke some holes
in your face.

35:16.976 --> 35:18.219
Shoo. Scat.

35:19.289 --> 35:20.773
Say hi to your mom for me.

35:23.155 --> 35:26.709
I like to do what I can
to educate the youth.

35:26.710 --> 35:28.298
I can see that.

35:32.820 --> 35:33.821
Oh, no.

35:36.064 --> 35:37.928
Is that a friend
of yours, Lily?

35:38.826 --> 35:40.447
No, just some guy
I was hoping

35:40.448 --> 35:42.347
I wouldn't have
to see for a while.

35:43.555 --> 35:47.179
Would you like me
to educate him a little?

35:48.974 --> 35:52.633
Why don't you see if he'll give
me that necklace he's wearing?

35:54.600 --> 35:57.637
We dated for five weeks,
and he never gave me anything.

35:57.638 --> 35:59.157
What a jerk.

36:03.954 --> 36:05.163
Mmm.

36:10.685 --> 36:11.686
Hey.

36:12.894 --> 36:14.481
Hey.

36:14.482 --> 36:17.761
So, uh, you here
to apologize or something?

36:20.971 --> 36:23.249
Yeah, some...

36:23.250 --> 36:25.147
Something kinda like that.

36:25.148 --> 36:27.218
You know, you can't go
over there empty-handed.

36:27.219 --> 36:30.221
You got to be bearing
some gifts, as they say.

36:30.222 --> 36:31.567
What do you got on you?

36:31.568 --> 36:33.914
Why, you're looking for
some drugs or something, man?

36:33.915 --> 36:35.502
I don't got anything like that.

36:35.503 --> 36:37.470
Do I look like
I need to score drugs

36:37.471 --> 36:40.127
from some wuss
in a record store?

36:40.128 --> 36:43.130
No. I mean, nice things.
Things for girls.

36:43.131 --> 36:46.617
Yeah, well, I'm fresh out
of nice things for girls, okay?

36:46.618 --> 36:47.895
What about this?

36:51.347 --> 36:52.726
I got this from
a close friend, okay?

36:52.727 --> 36:55.798
I'm not dating her
or anything like that.

36:55.799 --> 36:57.075
She's not my girlfriend.

36:57.076 --> 36:59.423
And she never will be,

36:59.424 --> 37:01.874
unless you learn
to make a sacrifice.

37:04.843 --> 37:06.084
All right.

37:06.085 --> 37:07.914
If you think it'll work.

37:07.915 --> 37:08.985
It'll work.

37:34.976 --> 37:36.149
This means a lot.

37:36.150 --> 37:37.565
So...

37:38.566 --> 37:41.811
You wanna hang out
when you get off your shift?

37:44.296 --> 37:45.573
Yeah?

37:48.024 --> 37:49.025
Yeah?

37:58.897 --> 38:01.865
That thing says we need
a drop of blood.

38:03.419 --> 38:05.834
Come on, bro.
What the fuck are you talking about?

38:05.835 --> 38:07.145
Candles and an offering.

38:07.146 --> 38:09.631
Something specific to the person
that you're trying to contact.

38:09.632 --> 38:12.392
Why is your computer
in the center?

38:12.393 --> 38:15.361
Because I need
a flat, black mirrored surface

38:15.362 --> 38:17.363
for visualizing the evocation,

38:17.364 --> 38:19.503
but I don't have
a polished black obelisk,

38:19.504 --> 38:21.850
so I'm using
my laptop screen instead.

38:21.851 --> 38:24.336
So you're like
FaceTiming a demon?

38:25.303 --> 38:27.200
Yeah, I guess so.

38:27.201 --> 38:28.374
Wow.

38:28.375 --> 38:30.065
So you got
a screen name in here?

38:30.066 --> 38:31.377
Just gonna give him a call?

38:31.378 --> 38:33.275
Come on. Let's do it.

38:33.276 --> 38:35.139
Oh, oh.
Okay, I'm out.

38:35.140 --> 38:37.383
What? What? Hey, man,
what if something crazy happens?

38:37.384 --> 38:38.798
Crazy is already
happening in here.

38:38.799 --> 38:42.111
You're about to worship
your computer by candlelight.

38:42.112 --> 38:43.458
If anything else happens,

38:43.459 --> 38:46.012
you got your cameras here
to capture it.

38:46.013 --> 38:47.876
So, I'm out.

38:47.877 --> 38:50.569
Fine. Just turn off
the lights before you go.

39:15.180 --> 39:18.700
"Spirits of the past,
move among us.

39:18.701 --> 39:21.599
"Be guided by the light
of this world,

39:21.600 --> 39:23.740
"and visit your soul upon us.

39:28.055 --> 39:32.161
"We... I bestow upon you

39:32.162 --> 39:35.407
"gifts from life into death.

39:36.477 --> 39:38.617
"Visit your soul upon us."

39:45.210 --> 39:46.694
That was something.

39:50.180 --> 39:52.354
The spirit of Quinn Scott,

39:52.355 --> 39:54.839
I offer you my body
as a vessel

39:54.840 --> 39:56.773
to once again merge
with the living.

40:03.711 --> 40:06.575
Oh. Hey, Professor.
What did you just say?

40:06.576 --> 40:08.991
Nevermind. I was
just clearing my voice.

40:08.992 --> 40:11.131
Interesting lighting.
Did the power go out?

40:11.132 --> 40:15.929
No. Just trying out some stuff
I found in this crazy notebook.

40:15.930 --> 40:18.069
I'm pretty sure nothing's
going to happen.

40:18.070 --> 40:19.139
This part of the documentary

40:19.140 --> 40:20.796
will probably just make me
look like an idiot.

40:20.797 --> 40:24.490
Get some answers before
you go diving in.

40:24.491 --> 40:26.250
Thanks, Professor. Talk soon.

40:26.251 --> 40:27.838
Goodbye, Jason.

40:30.324 --> 40:32.464
My camera's out of memory.

40:40.541 --> 40:43.025
Here. Put this on.

40:43.026 --> 40:44.579
Okay. Okay.

40:44.580 --> 40:46.685
- Hurry up.
- I'll be right back.

40:54.210 --> 40:55.762
Yeah, uh...

40:55.763 --> 40:59.801
This isn't gonna work,
like, right now.

40:59.802 --> 41:03.114
Oh, my God,
you're such a loser.

41:09.950 --> 41:10.951
Hello?

41:11.399 --> 41:13.021
Oh, hey.

41:13.022 --> 41:16.024
I've been thinking
about it, and, uh...

41:16.025 --> 41:18.545
I think I'm down
to do your interview.

41:19.856 --> 41:22.134
What made you change your mind?

41:22.859 --> 41:25.136
I don't know,
I was just, um...

41:25.137 --> 41:28.519
Just thinking it might be
a good opportunity.

41:28.520 --> 41:31.073
You know, even if nothing's
really going on

41:31.074 --> 41:33.420
with my career right now,
it might be good.

41:33.421 --> 41:35.146
I mean, for the future,

41:35.147 --> 41:37.321
see what I'm like now.

41:37.322 --> 41:39.945
I totally agree.
Maybe tomorrow?

41:41.084 --> 41:43.879
You should head over
before I change my mind.

41:43.880 --> 41:44.915
Okay.

41:44.916 --> 41:47.089
Then everything's
cool between us?

41:47.090 --> 41:48.125
Yeah, of course.

41:48.126 --> 41:51.854
Oh, can you bring that
notebook from earlier?

41:53.407 --> 41:54.683
I want to look at it.

41:54.684 --> 41:57.341
Yeah, I wanted to talk
to you about it, too.

41:57.342 --> 41:58.826
I'll be over soon.

42:57.298 --> 42:59.783
Extend your hands

42:59.784 --> 43:02.717
beyond the clouds to the stars.

43:02.718 --> 43:06.721
Eyes gazing beyond your reach.

43:06.722 --> 43:10.690
Let yourself glide
across the edge of the cliff,

43:10.691 --> 43:14.868
and soar with broken wings.

43:16.490 --> 43:19.010
Drink the view
until you're quenched.

43:19.907 --> 43:23.185
Forget your raffish trade.

43:23.186 --> 43:27.812
An offering of innocence
will plow you to the stage.

43:29.848 --> 43:33.058
The ride is short
and fast, my friend.

43:34.439 --> 43:38.374
Your soul drowns while you wait.

43:39.755 --> 43:44.275
There's hell below.
Enjoy the show.

43:44.276 --> 43:48.280
For you, it has been made.

43:52.560 --> 43:55.148
So, when did you first
start singing?

43:55.149 --> 43:58.083
I've always been singing.
It's who I am.

43:59.326 --> 44:03.847
Then I guess, uh,
when did you first start performing?

44:03.848 --> 44:06.090
Can I be honest
to you about something?

44:06.091 --> 44:07.540
Yeah, sure.

44:07.541 --> 44:09.887
These questions
are really boring.

44:09.888 --> 44:12.372
What kind of interview
did you want this to be?

44:12.373 --> 44:15.066
Uh, okay, let me think.

44:15.998 --> 44:18.137
Since you asked me
to bring it over,

44:18.138 --> 44:22.349
how about we talk
about the notebook?

44:23.453 --> 44:24.903
Let me see it.

44:33.740 --> 44:35.982
Oh, my God.

44:35.983 --> 44:37.294
What?

44:37.295 --> 44:40.021
I knew this looked familiar.

44:40.022 --> 44:42.161
This is Derek's book.
I saw it at his place.

44:42.162 --> 44:44.750
We actually tried
using it one time

44:44.751 --> 44:46.373
to talk to dead rockstars.

44:48.547 --> 44:51.342
He said that Quinn used
this book to become famous.

44:51.343 --> 44:52.861
Yeah?

44:52.862 --> 44:55.105
I could take you to his place

44:55.106 --> 44:57.833
and you could ask him yourself.

44:59.869 --> 45:01.837
Yeah, yeah, let's do that.

45:02.596 --> 45:03.770
Okay.

45:07.774 --> 45:10.708
I think it's through here,
but it's been a while.

45:37.113 --> 45:39.597
I got rid
of it because it's useless!

45:39.598 --> 45:40.840
I'm done with it.

45:40.841 --> 45:43.049
Let someone else ruin
their life with that shit.

45:43.050 --> 45:44.533
You need to get it back!

45:44.534 --> 45:47.226
You're the only one
that's seen it work before.

45:47.227 --> 45:49.746
Not like I hid
it in a safe place.

45:49.747 --> 45:52.507
I wanted to be done with it!

45:52.508 --> 45:54.095
It's gone.

45:54.096 --> 45:57.512
Finally, I have
something good enough to offer,

45:57.513 --> 45:59.377
and now it's fucking wasted.

46:04.520 --> 46:05.866
Derek?

46:06.349 --> 46:07.903
Are you down here?

46:22.676 --> 46:23.849
Stop it!

46:23.850 --> 46:26.679
Derek, you need
to get over here.

46:26.680 --> 46:27.957
Leave him alone.

46:29.407 --> 46:32.341
You shouldn't be here.

46:33.342 --> 46:35.206
Did she get out?

46:39.072 --> 46:41.418
Now, what do we have here?

46:41.419 --> 46:43.040
Tell him to let go of Jason.

46:43.041 --> 46:44.939
I caught these fucks
sneaking around.

46:44.940 --> 46:46.354
Kyle, cool off.

46:46.355 --> 46:49.046
What the hell
are you doing here?

46:49.047 --> 46:50.877
Tell him to let him go.

46:51.947 --> 46:55.053
He's harmless.
We just came by to talk to you.

46:59.471 --> 47:02.302
And what do you want
to talk to me about, huh?

47:06.168 --> 47:09.516
Let him up before he pisses
all over my floor.

47:14.176 --> 47:16.626
We came by
to talk to you...

47:17.386 --> 47:18.905
About this.

47:20.492 --> 47:24.357
It's no big deal.
We can get out of here if you want.

47:24.358 --> 47:25.876
Relax.

47:25.877 --> 47:28.155
I think you guys should
stay for a bit.

47:28.915 --> 47:30.295
Follow me.

47:51.040 --> 47:53.697
- That thing rolling?
- Yep.

47:53.698 --> 47:57.426
Maybe we can start by you telling
me where you first saw the book.

47:58.427 --> 47:59.703
It's Quinn's book.

47:59.704 --> 48:02.292
He gave it to me just before
he started really taking off,

48:02.293 --> 48:04.811
said he didn't need it anymore.

48:04.812 --> 48:06.365
The more I watched
Quinn's success,

48:06.366 --> 48:09.541
the more I was convinced it had
everything to do with this book.

48:12.786 --> 48:15.339
But something
was always missing.

48:15.340 --> 48:17.515
- What was it?
- This page here.

48:19.689 --> 48:21.552
It's a reproduction
of a contract

48:21.553 --> 48:24.762
like Robert Johnson
signed with the devil.

48:24.763 --> 48:27.249
If you noticed,
the signature's missing.

48:28.836 --> 48:31.701
But this page
always seemed special.

48:33.082 --> 48:35.428
Then how did Quinn
get it to work for him?

48:35.429 --> 48:37.775
You ever notice
he always wore a necklace

48:37.776 --> 48:40.330
with a little metal
cylinder on it?

48:40.331 --> 48:42.815
Whatever's in that thing
is key to this page,

48:42.816 --> 48:46.577
and without it, the book wouldn't
give me what I begged it for.

48:46.578 --> 48:48.441
But my time's passed.

48:48.442 --> 48:50.167
And I'm cursed
to live out my life

48:50.168 --> 48:52.859
knowing that I have done
ten times what I need to

48:52.860 --> 48:54.483
to secure my place in hell.

48:57.037 --> 49:00.902
Have you ever thought
about just destroying it?

49:00.903 --> 49:02.835
We've got a furnace
in that room over there

49:02.836 --> 49:05.458
that'll completely
destroy anything.

49:05.459 --> 49:06.632
And, yeah,

49:06.633 --> 49:10.429
I've considered throwing this
in there a few times.

49:10.430 --> 49:12.914
When I heard Quinn died,
I figured it was time

49:12.915 --> 49:17.091
to give some other sucker a chance
of putting the two together.

49:17.092 --> 49:19.680
I guess it's not finished
with me after all.

49:21.268 --> 49:23.615
I was at Quinn's
the night he died.

49:25.824 --> 49:27.067
Now...

49:28.517 --> 49:29.586
I have this.

49:41.150 --> 49:43.014
I want to try it first.

50:26.023 --> 50:27.541
I wanna talk to Amy.

50:30.199 --> 50:32.373
You can open up the door,

50:32.374 --> 50:34.790
but you don't get
to pick what comes out.

50:36.757 --> 50:38.311
The scroll found me.

50:46.595 --> 50:47.905
What the hell is that?

50:47.906 --> 50:49.287
Shit. Is that a heart?

50:50.116 --> 50:52.531
It's Quinn Scott's heart.

50:52.532 --> 50:54.189
I killed for it.

50:55.742 --> 50:57.123
Good enough?

51:03.129 --> 51:04.613
We should get out of here.

51:05.821 --> 51:07.409
Quiet.

51:11.240 --> 51:13.931
Spirits of the past,
move among us

51:13.932 --> 51:16.002
guided by the light
of this world

51:16.003 --> 51:17.557
and visit upon us.

51:18.144 --> 51:20.524
Our door is open to you.

51:20.525 --> 51:23.631
The spirit of Quinn Scott,
we call to you.

51:23.632 --> 51:26.944
We call to you with that
which made you human.

51:26.945 --> 51:30.190
There is one in our presence
who has touched darkness.

51:30.880 --> 51:32.364
Give us a sign.

51:32.365 --> 51:34.194
Show us you are here.

51:52.005 --> 51:54.317
Let me be your vessel.

51:54.318 --> 51:57.252
Take my body and do
your will again on Earth.

52:10.851 --> 52:13.406
- That's not a spirit. He's having a heart...
- Jason, stop.

52:18.376 --> 52:20.758
- He's gonna die.
- Let him!

52:22.069 --> 52:24.001
Let him be your vessel.

52:25.107 --> 52:26.419
I am your vessel.

52:26.833 --> 52:27.867
No!

52:27.868 --> 52:29.179
I feel your presence.

52:29.180 --> 52:31.388
You bitch.
You're fucking ruining it!

52:31.389 --> 52:33.771
- I will be your servant.
- Stop!

52:35.980 --> 52:37.430
You're fucking ruining it!

52:44.575 --> 52:46.646
Oh, you're gonna make
such a good offering.

52:48.993 --> 52:49.993
Stop it!

53:53.678 --> 53:55.956
<i>♪ There ain't no kind
of way out here</i>

53:57.958 --> 54:00.858
<i>♪ I've chosen a wild ride
into the woods, yeah</i>

54:03.447 --> 54:06.518

56:08.123 --> 56:09.710
I wrote a song for this man.

I can't believe that's me.

57:53.331 --> 57:54.608
What's up, bro-seph?

57:54.609 --> 57:55.988
Don't you ever knock?

57:55.989 --> 57:58.577
Not when you stay out two
nights in a row, my friend.

57:58.578 --> 58:00.477
What the fuck is this?

58:00.856 --> 58:01.925
It's Derek.

58:01.926 --> 58:04.203
Why the fuck do you
have pictures of him?

58:04.204 --> 58:05.515
I don't know.

58:05.516 --> 58:09.070
He let me go over to his place
and interview him last night.

58:09.071 --> 58:12.004
Yeah, about what, being a fucking
drug-dealing creep asshole?

58:12.005 --> 58:13.558
That guy used to stalk
Jenny and Lily.

58:13.559 --> 58:16.561
They said he would try to get 'em
high when they were, like, 16.

58:16.562 --> 58:18.390
I didn't know that, you know.

58:18.391 --> 58:19.598
He didn't seem that bad
at the time.

58:19.599 --> 58:21.462
Maybe he's mellowed out
or something.

58:21.463 --> 58:23.326
Whatever that means.

58:23.327 --> 58:26.487
Just don't let Jenny find out if you wanna
keep your head attached to your body.

58:26.606 --> 58:28.227
Thanks for the advice.

58:28.228 --> 58:30.713
Wash my shirt
before you give it back, please.

58:30.714 --> 58:32.231
Where the fuck did you
find that anyway?

58:32.232 --> 58:33.510
I thought I lost it months ago.

58:33.889 --> 58:35.096
I...

58:35.097 --> 58:36.339
Don't steal my shit.

58:36.340 --> 58:37.824
Yeah.

58:45.936 --> 58:48.420
- Hey.
- I love you.

58:48.421 --> 58:49.766
I'm sorry. What?

58:49.767 --> 58:52.286
Why didn't you tell me you
were gonna upload the video?

58:52.287 --> 58:54.357
- Oh...
- People love me.

58:54.358 --> 58:56.186
Yeah, yeah. Well,
you were amazing.

58:56.187 --> 58:59.707
A friend watched it and wants me to
perform at her coffee shop later.

58:59.708 --> 59:02.124
I would love for you
to film it.

59:02.573 --> 59:03.849
Okay.

59:03.850 --> 59:06.956
Thanks for believing in me.

59:06.957 --> 59:09.165
None of this would be
happening without you.

59:09.166 --> 59:12.720
Well, I knew you'd be
a big help to my project, so...

59:12.721 --> 59:14.204
I'll see you later tonight.

59:14.205 --> 59:15.344
See you soon.

You killed it.

01:00:42.224 --> 01:00:43.190
Did you guys love it?

01:00:43.191 --> 01:00:45.986
Oh, my God.
You were amazing, Lily.

01:00:45.987 --> 01:00:47.021
Thanks.

01:00:47.022 --> 01:00:50.024
Finding my voice has been
a really cool thing.

01:00:50.025 --> 01:00:52.131
I'm just really glad
you guys could make it.

01:00:53.442 --> 01:00:54.927

01:00:55.479 --> 01:00:57.066

01:00:57.067 --> 01:00:58.827
Excuse me. Lily?

01:00:59.690 --> 01:01:01.449
I loved your performance.

01:01:01.450 --> 01:01:03.486
You have an amazing voice.

01:01:03.487 --> 01:01:05.937
My name is Mick.
I'm a record producer.

01:01:05.938 --> 01:01:07.904
I wanted to know if you'll
come by my studio tomorrow

01:01:07.905 --> 01:01:10.217
to record vocals
for one of my songs.

01:01:10.218 --> 01:01:12.322
Oh, wow.

01:01:12.323 --> 01:01:14.497
Yeah, that would be great.

01:01:14.498 --> 01:01:15.982
- Thank you.
- No...

01:01:16.431 --> 01:01:17.431
Thank you.

01:01:18.088 --> 01:01:20.089
Here's my card.

01:01:20.090 --> 01:01:23.230
Give my studio a call tomorrow,
and they'll get you all set up.

01:01:23.231 --> 01:01:24.162
Okay.

01:01:24.163 --> 01:01:25.683
You guys have
a great night, all right?

01:01:28.892 --> 01:01:30.409
Ready to go, Jason?

01:01:30.410 --> 01:01:32.584
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:01:32.585 --> 01:01:33.966
It's good seeing you guys.

01:02:06.550 --> 01:02:08.241
No. Maybe this.

01:02:15.870 --> 01:02:17.284
How's it going over there?

01:02:17.285 --> 01:02:19.114
What? Oh, um...

01:02:19.597 --> 01:02:21.358
Sorry, I just...

01:02:22.669 --> 01:02:24.084
You know what?
I'm gonna take off

01:02:24.085 --> 01:02:25.485
and give you some
space to practice.

01:02:25.811 --> 01:02:27.881
Yup. Yup, okay.

01:02:27.882 --> 01:02:29.262
Gonna use the bathroom
before I go.

01:02:30.332 --> 01:02:31.850
Oh, uh, no.

01:02:31.851 --> 01:02:33.818
No, it's not... Sorry.

01:02:33.819 --> 01:02:36.648
It's broken.
Totally useless in there.

01:02:36.649 --> 01:02:38.478
Nothing works.

01:02:39.548 --> 01:02:40.964
Okay.

01:02:45.865 --> 01:02:47.487
- Hey.
- Jesus!

01:02:48.419 --> 01:02:50.456
- Calm down, dude.
- Okay.

01:02:51.388 --> 01:02:52.802
I just...

01:02:52.803 --> 01:02:55.910
I wanted to see if you would film
the recording session tomorrow?

01:02:56.842 --> 01:02:58.257
Yeah, fine.

01:02:58.809 --> 01:02:59.948
"Fine"?

01:03:00.362 --> 01:03:01.362
Yeah.

01:03:02.606 --> 01:03:03.952
Uh, okay.

01:03:04.711 --> 01:03:05.920
Thanks.

01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:13.341
I'll see you then.

01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:15.481
Okay.

01:03:20.900 --> 01:03:22.833
But I got to practice, so...

01:03:23.144 --> 01:03:24.144
Okay.

01:04:08.914 --> 01:04:10.847
I'm the reason that
you've been chosen.

01:04:11.951 --> 01:04:13.089
What do you want?

01:04:13.090 --> 01:04:15.471
Revenge for killing
that piece of shit?

01:04:15.472 --> 01:04:18.577
No, I want your power.

01:04:18.578 --> 01:04:20.717
You don't know its strength.

01:04:20.718 --> 01:04:22.996
Until you kill someone pure.

01:04:22.997 --> 01:04:26.379
It'll never end.
You'll keep killing.

01:04:37.943 --> 01:04:39.599
I devoted my life to this.

01:04:40.428 --> 01:04:42.602
And you stole it from me!

01:05:06.454 --> 01:05:08.834
Do you wanna fuck me?

01:05:08.835 --> 01:05:10.906
Cum all over me.

01:05:10.907 --> 01:05:12.494
Be right there.

01:05:16.429 --> 01:05:17.465
Yep?

01:05:18.707 --> 01:05:19.985
Hi, Zane.

01:05:20.606 --> 01:05:21.847
What are you doing here?

01:05:21.848 --> 01:05:23.746
Don't be cute.

01:05:23.747 --> 01:05:24.920
I told you last time.

01:05:24.921 --> 01:05:27.061
That it was a mistake
and we should stop.

01:05:27.993 --> 01:05:29.477
I see the way
you look at me.

01:05:29.995 --> 01:05:31.272
Wanting more.

01:05:32.998 --> 01:05:35.000
Aren't you gonna
invite me in?

01:05:36.415 --> 01:05:38.624
God, you're a mess.

01:05:39.694 --> 01:05:41.489
A fucking hot mess, though.

01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:44.009
All right.

01:05:44.664 --> 01:05:46.252
This is truly the last time.

01:05:55.261 --> 01:05:57.262
Simply being a part
of the generation

01:05:57.263 --> 01:05:59.093
isn't good enough
for most of you.

01:06:00.163 --> 01:06:04.339
So desperate to know
this secret.

01:06:05.064 --> 01:06:06.340
Yeah, it's a big
fucking secret

01:06:06.341 --> 01:06:08.688
that everybody who seems
to know won't tell.

01:06:10.311 --> 01:06:12.969
How can I make people want me?

01:06:16.731 --> 01:06:17.938
It's bullshit.

01:06:17.939 --> 01:06:21.079
You know, fame isn't
a reflection of...

01:06:21.080 --> 01:06:25.049
Of skill or talent.

01:06:25.050 --> 01:06:29.330
It's all just...
It's all just...

01:06:32.471 --> 01:06:33.748
Magnetism.

01:06:35.439 --> 01:06:39.271
It's wasted on people who want it.
They just can't make it last.

01:06:41.825 --> 01:06:44.138
Maybe the answer is...

01:06:44.690 --> 01:06:47.141
do nothing.

01:06:47.865 --> 01:06:48.934
Huh.

01:06:48.935 --> 01:06:51.213
That's the fucking trick.

01:06:51.214 --> 01:06:56.114
It's just you wanting
people to want you back.

01:06:56.115 --> 01:06:58.738
Nothing pushes people away
like feeling wanted.

01:07:00.637 --> 01:07:03.433
So you fucked it up
before you even got started.

01:07:05.849 --> 01:07:08.576
There are just some people
who want nothing to do with you.

01:07:10.129 --> 01:07:13.201
And those are the ones
who you give all your love to.

01:07:18.620 --> 01:07:20.000
Lily.

01:07:20.001 --> 01:07:21.864
I see you're all settled in.

01:07:21.865 --> 01:07:23.659
I hope you don't mind,
I told Jason

01:07:23.660 --> 01:07:25.937
I'd let him film
for his little project.

01:07:25.938 --> 01:07:27.456
Of course not.

01:07:27.457 --> 01:07:30.286
You've got a great eye
for talent, Jason.

01:07:30.287 --> 01:07:32.702
I see this girl
doing big things.

01:07:32.703 --> 01:07:35.188
If she's willing to work hard
and make sacrifices.

01:07:35.189 --> 01:07:37.259
Whatever it takes. Right?

01:07:37.260 --> 01:07:39.744
Yeah.

01:07:39.745 --> 01:07:42.057
So, feel good?

01:07:42.058 --> 01:07:43.713
You ready
to make some magic?

01:07:43.714 --> 01:07:45.301
Absolutely.

01:07:45.302 --> 01:07:47.476
Jason, let's give her the booth.

01:07:47.477 --> 01:07:49.685
You can film
from the control room.

01:07:49.686 --> 01:07:50.686
Got it.

01:07:58.695 --> 01:08:00.110

01:09:36.965 --> 01:09:39.450
Yeah, amazing as always.

01:09:39.451 --> 01:09:41.140

01:09:45.388 --> 01:09:47.042
All right, I wanna
thank you guys right now.

01:09:47.044 --> 01:09:48.631
I'll be in touch.

01:09:48.631 --> 01:09:51.151
Check in with my
secretary on the way out.

01:09:51.152 --> 01:09:52.705
Nice job.

01:09:54.466 --> 01:09:56.294
- What's wrong?
- It's Jenny.

01:09:56.295 --> 01:09:58.573
She's been calling
and texting this whole time.

01:10:00.541 --> 01:10:02.645
Ugh. Weird.

01:10:02.646 --> 01:10:04.923
We should probably
call her back.

01:10:04.924 --> 01:10:08.272
Yeah, don't worry about it.
I'll call her back.

01:10:08.273 --> 01:10:09.826
I'm just so excited!

01:10:11.793 --> 01:10:13.932
And you haven't heard
from him all day?

01:10:13.933 --> 01:10:16.935
I got this weird text
from him this morning,

01:10:16.936 --> 01:10:18.628
saying he wanted some space.

01:10:19.387 --> 01:10:21.458
Sorry. I'm sure he's fine.

01:10:21.872 --> 01:10:22.907
Thanks.

01:10:22.908 --> 01:10:25.565
Well, we're headed
to Jason's room right now.

01:10:25.566 --> 01:10:28.292
I mean, we're headed
to his place.

01:10:28.293 --> 01:10:29.535
Right, Jason?

01:10:31.123 --> 01:10:32.641
Uh, yeah, yeah.

01:10:32.642 --> 01:10:34.298
I'll give you a call
whenever we get there

01:10:34.299 --> 01:10:36.127
and let you know
that he's okay.

01:10:36.128 --> 01:10:38.094
- Okay?
- Thank you, Jason.

01:10:38.095 --> 01:10:40.442
Congratulations,
by the way, Lily.

01:10:40.443 --> 01:10:42.927
I know today
was a big deal for you.

01:10:42.928 --> 01:10:44.377
Thanks.

01:10:44.378 --> 01:10:46.518
- We'll talk later, okay?
- Okay.

01:10:50.315 --> 01:10:51.763
Is that Zane?

01:10:51.764 --> 01:10:53.456
Mmm. Unknown number.

01:10:54.111 --> 01:10:55.871
They loved it.

01:10:55.872 --> 01:10:57.355
Uh-huh.

01:10:57.356 --> 01:11:00.116
They want you to release it as a
single before the movie comes out.

01:11:00.117 --> 01:11:01.566
We'll need you
this weekend.

01:11:01.567 --> 01:11:03.154
We'll be staying
at my beach house.

01:11:03.155 --> 01:11:04.362
Holy shit.

01:11:04.363 --> 01:11:05.985
I mean, yes.

01:11:07.228 --> 01:11:08.919
They loved the track.

01:11:09.230 --> 01:11:10.265
Awesome.

01:11:10.266 --> 01:11:11.921
- Lily, are you there?
- Yeah.

01:11:11.922 --> 01:11:13.060
Sorry.

01:11:13.061 --> 01:11:15.580
They want you to shoot
a video when you get there.

01:11:15.581 --> 01:11:17.651
So I'm gonna need you
to sign a few more papers,

01:11:17.652 --> 01:11:19.481
you know, before you head out.

01:11:19.482 --> 01:11:20.620
Here's the deal.

01:11:20.621 --> 01:11:22.863
Now, this is the age
of the Internet,

01:11:22.864 --> 01:11:25.383
so I got to ask...

01:11:25.384 --> 01:11:28.179
Do you have any damning videos?

01:11:28.180 --> 01:11:30.181
You know, sex tapes
or otherwise.

01:11:30.182 --> 01:11:32.356
No, of course not.

01:11:32.357 --> 01:11:34.462
All my sex happens
off-camera.

01:11:35.739 --> 01:11:38.120
Yeah, that's what I figured,
but I had to ask.

01:11:38.121 --> 01:11:39.915
- Of course.
- All right.

01:11:39.916 --> 01:11:41.814
- I'll be in touch.
- Thanks.

01:11:44.161 --> 01:11:45.748
What were you talking about?

01:11:45.749 --> 01:11:48.510
Oh, it's nothing.
He was just making a joke.

01:11:48.511 --> 01:11:50.857
He's making sex jokes already?

01:11:50.858 --> 01:11:53.343
It's nothing. Chill.

01:11:53.585 --> 01:11:54.723
Oh!

01:11:54.724 --> 01:11:57.796
So, I would love to see
a cut of the documentary.

01:11:58.831 --> 01:11:59.970
Can we watch?

01:12:00.316 --> 01:12:01.833
Um, yeah.

01:12:01.834 --> 01:12:03.387
Yeah, I actually
have an early cut.

01:12:03.388 --> 01:12:05.285
I'll show it to you
when we get to my place.

01:12:05.286 --> 01:12:06.494
Great.

01:12:10.326 --> 01:12:12.154
I have a key to Zane's room
in my drawer.

01:12:12.155 --> 01:12:13.777
I'm just gonna grab it
really fast.

01:12:39.424 --> 01:12:40.838
Today has been way too good

01:12:40.839 --> 01:12:43.635
to let Jenny and Zane's
shit bring me down.

01:12:49.295 --> 01:12:50.814
Don't be scared.

01:12:51.332 --> 01:12:52.851
I know you want me.

01:12:54.231 --> 01:12:56.405
What happens when you leave?

01:12:56.406 --> 01:12:58.684
You don't want some boyfriend
weighing you down.

01:13:37.378 --> 01:13:38.517
Shit.

01:13:39.207 --> 01:13:40.518
Oh, hey.

01:13:40.519 --> 01:13:41.933
Wait, I need to get that.

01:13:41.934 --> 01:13:42.970
I got to take this.

01:13:51.288 --> 01:13:52.737
Jason, just wanted
to check in.

01:13:52.738 --> 01:13:54.429
I know you've been real busy.

01:13:54.430 --> 01:13:56.500
Yes, thank you. Very busy.

01:13:56.501 --> 01:13:59.123
Not too busy to have
a little fun, though.

01:13:59.124 --> 01:14:01.366
Yeah, that's...
That's true.

01:14:01.367 --> 01:14:03.507
Hello, dear. Everything's fine.

01:14:03.508 --> 01:14:04.956
I'm Jason's professor.

01:14:04.957 --> 01:14:07.442
Is there anything specific
you wanted to ask me about?

01:14:07.443 --> 01:14:08.788
I've got an opportunity for you

01:14:08.789 --> 01:14:11.480
to screen your
documentary next week.

01:14:11.481 --> 01:14:13.793
Apparently, some producers
are coming to the school

01:14:13.794 --> 01:14:16.554
and want to check out
some student projects.

01:14:16.555 --> 01:14:19.315
Wow. Uh, yeah.

01:14:19.316 --> 01:14:20.662
I mean, it'll take
a lot of editing,

01:14:20.663 --> 01:14:22.664
but I think I have everything
I need to get it done.

01:14:22.665 --> 01:14:25.114
Wonderful. Enjoy the rest
of your night.

01:14:25.115 --> 01:14:26.184
You, too, dear.

01:14:26.185 --> 01:14:27.463
Thank you. Bye.

01:14:33.158 --> 01:14:34.883
Where are you going?

01:14:34.884 --> 01:14:37.195
Zane still hasn't
gotten back in touch with me,

01:14:37.196 --> 01:14:39.267
so I'm gonna go
check on him.

01:14:41.615 --> 01:14:43.754
- Oh, wait.
- What?

01:14:43.755 --> 01:14:45.100
What is it? What's the matter?

01:14:45.101 --> 01:14:47.261
I'm just gonna open up
his door and take a look around.

01:14:47.931 --> 01:14:49.036
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:15:06.363 --> 01:15:07.641
Zane?

01:15:09.746 --> 01:15:10.747
Buddy?

01:15:11.576 --> 01:15:13.129
What's going on, man?

01:15:15.890 --> 01:15:17.926
Oh, my God.

01:15:17.927 --> 01:15:19.825
Lily, you've got
to come see this.

01:15:20.654 --> 01:15:22.621
I've never seen his bed made.

01:15:23.657 --> 01:15:25.693
Must be really going
through some shit.

01:15:27.868 --> 01:15:29.007
Lily?

01:15:30.456 --> 01:15:31.665
Lily?

01:15:32.044 --> 01:15:33.044
Lily?

01:15:33.494 --> 01:15:35.151
What the fuck?

01:15:36.186 --> 01:15:37.428
I don't know where he is.

01:15:37.429 --> 01:15:39.879
Your psycho sister stole all
of my shit and then bolted.

01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:42.572
I'm on my way now.
Meet me there.

01:15:44.850 --> 01:15:45.886
Lily!

01:15:46.231 --> 01:15:47.438
Lily!

01:15:47.439 --> 01:15:49.614
Open up! Lily!

01:15:51.098 --> 01:15:52.617
- Jason!
- Lily!

01:15:53.687 --> 01:15:55.087
- Where is she?
- Do you have a key?

01:15:56.310 --> 01:15:59.312
She stole everything.
She stole my whole documentary.

01:15:59.313 --> 01:16:01.556
My camera, my phone,
my computer.

01:16:01.557 --> 01:16:03.040
I am so sorry

01:16:03.041 --> 01:16:05.111
that you're getting dragged
into her problems.

01:16:05.112 --> 01:16:07.770
I actually thought you'd be
a good influence on her.

01:16:20.265 --> 01:16:22.887
Where are all
the beer cans and bongs

01:16:22.888 --> 01:16:25.303
and things she usually
has piled up everywhere?

01:16:25.304 --> 01:16:27.686
Yeah, this is strange.

01:16:29.377 --> 01:16:30.827
I've got to check something.

01:16:36.902 --> 01:16:38.662
I'm so sorry, Jason.

01:16:38.663 --> 01:16:40.111
As soon as we find out
where she went,

01:16:40.112 --> 01:16:41.975
I'll make sure you
get all your things back.

01:16:41.976 --> 01:16:43.771
I think I know where to go.

01:16:49.570 --> 01:16:51.122
I think she's down here.

01:17:40.345 --> 01:17:42.449
Oh, my God. Lily!

01:17:42.450 --> 01:17:44.141
Dude, you burned all my stuff?

01:17:44.142 --> 01:17:46.662
We need to get her
out of here.

01:17:47.386 --> 01:17:50.010
Lily, what is wrong with you?

01:17:51.494 --> 01:17:53.323
Come on, Lily.

01:18:05.715 --> 01:18:08.337
I'm sorry for what I did.

01:18:08.338 --> 01:18:09.684
It's okay.

01:18:09.685 --> 01:18:11.858
It's okay.

01:18:11.859 --> 01:18:13.861
We'll get you out of here.

01:18:16.622 --> 01:18:17.795
You'll be okay.

01:18:17.796 --> 01:18:19.453
I'm so sorry.

01:18:20.696 --> 01:18:21.904
Okay.

01:18:23.146 --> 01:18:25.908
Stay right here.
I'll be right back.

01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:38.402
Christina?

01:18:40.750 --> 01:18:41.957
Help!

01:18:41.958 --> 01:18:44.443
Okay.
I'm coming in.

01:18:53.418 --> 01:18:55.213
Wait for Jason to come back.

01:18:59.942 --> 01:19:02.944
Listen to me,
you selfish bitch!

01:19:12.644 --> 01:19:14.439
Let me out of here.

01:19:15.371 --> 01:19:17.925
Lily, they've got
somebody locked in here.

01:19:24.898 --> 01:19:26.451
Lily, call for help.

01:19:31.352 --> 01:19:32.422
Lily?

01:19:35.011 --> 01:19:37.254
Lily, what's wrong with you?

01:19:37.255 --> 01:19:39.775
- What's happened to you?
- Jason!

01:19:41.846 --> 01:19:43.536
We need to get out of here.

01:19:43.537 --> 01:19:45.124
We can't. We can't leave her.

01:19:45.125 --> 01:19:46.298
Try these.

01:19:53.064 --> 01:19:54.029
Hey, hey!

01:19:54.030 --> 01:19:56.307
It's okay, it's okay.
Don't be scared.

01:19:56.308 --> 01:19:57.516
Listen, okay?

01:19:58.448 --> 01:19:59.724
No!

01:19:59.725 --> 01:20:01.865
It's just Jenny.
She's here to help, okay?

01:20:29.065 --> 01:20:33.828
Look, special people don't
have control over their lives.

01:20:33.829 --> 01:20:35.968
They only believe
in the present moment.

01:20:35.969 --> 01:20:38.108
You can let go and give in.

01:20:38.109 --> 01:20:39.626
You could be your true self.

01:20:39.627 --> 01:20:42.733
I take the moment and I turn
it into something beautiful.

01:20:42.734 --> 01:20:45.253
And if I can't,
I destroy it.

01:20:45.254 --> 01:20:47.634
Look, fear of losing your life

01:20:47.635 --> 01:20:49.188
prevents you
from even living it.

01:20:49.189 --> 01:20:52.536
Special people are
ignorant of the rules,

01:20:52.537 --> 01:20:53.986
scarier than their fears,

01:20:53.987 --> 01:20:56.437
and more important than
their limited time on Earth.

01:21:03.306 --> 01:21:05.514
All right, Lily,
don't worry. Don't be nervous.

01:21:05.515 --> 01:21:06.653
No tough questions tonight

01:21:06.654 --> 01:21:08.552
'cause it's all about
promotion for your concert.

01:21:08.553 --> 01:21:10.381
Thank you so much.

01:21:10.382 --> 01:21:12.176
- How are you feeling? Good?
- I'm feeling good.

01:21:12.177 --> 01:21:14.834
- All right, how are we looking, Cliff?
- Looking good, doll.

01:21:14.835 --> 01:21:16.698
All right, count me off.

01:21:16.699 --> 01:21:20.012
Here we are
in three, two...

01:21:20.013 --> 01:21:22.669
So, Lily, how does it feel
being at the tail end

01:21:22.670 --> 01:21:24.809
of your very first
sold-out tour?

01:21:24.810 --> 01:21:26.363
It's great.

01:21:26.364 --> 01:21:30.022
It's been amazing
meeting with fans

01:21:30.023 --> 01:21:33.853
and feeling so much support
through this tough time.

01:21:33.854 --> 01:21:37.167
This last year was the hardest
thing I've ever had to go through.

01:21:37.168 --> 01:21:38.789
Speaking of the last year,

01:21:38.790 --> 01:21:41.999
are you at all concerned that you
haven't given yourself enough time

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.243
to process everything
that's happened to you,

01:21:44.244 --> 01:21:48.109
that you got back to work
too soon after the tragedy?

01:21:48.110 --> 01:21:52.078
I think performing has
helped me process

01:21:52.079 --> 01:21:55.495
losing all my friends
and, you know, my sister

01:21:55.496 --> 01:21:56.981
being in a coma.

01:21:58.016 --> 01:22:00.673
She's such a survivor.

01:22:00.674 --> 01:22:06.611
And that helps me not to feel
like, you know, a victim myself.

01:22:07.370 --> 01:22:09.406
And of course,
my producer, Mick,

01:22:09.407 --> 01:22:13.030
has been with me
through all of this.

01:22:13.031 --> 01:22:15.619
You never know when
it's gonna be your time,

01:22:15.620 --> 01:22:17.483
so you just...

01:22:17.484 --> 01:22:20.970
You have to pursue your dream
while you still have the chance.

01:22:22.627 --> 01:22:25.216
You know, live for today.

01:22:28.529 --> 01:22:30.289
Five minutes, guys.

01:22:30.290 --> 01:22:32.843
Very inspiring, Lily.
Words to live by.

01:22:32.844 --> 01:22:35.225
- Thank you so much.
- Yes, thank you.

01:22:35.226 --> 01:22:36.812
I hope you enjoy the show.

01:22:36.813 --> 01:22:38.400
Oh, we certainly will, Lily.

01:22:38.401 --> 01:22:39.988
We certainly will.

01:22:39.989 --> 01:22:41.404
Let's go.

01:22:45.753 --> 01:22:47.306
What an amazing story.

01:22:47.307 --> 01:22:50.274
Lily Glance, survivor
of a crazed serial killer,

01:22:50.275 --> 01:22:52.449
turning tragedy into triumph.

01:22:52.450 --> 01:22:54.209
It's been one year
since the fateful night

01:22:54.210 --> 01:22:57.212
when Lily Glance lost
several of her closest friends

01:22:57.213 --> 01:22:59.594
and nearly lost her sister

01:22:59.595 --> 01:23:01.113
at the hands of Jason Reed,

01:23:01.114 --> 01:23:04.357
a fame-obsessed filmmaker
who murdered five young people

01:23:04.358 --> 01:23:06.463
and placed Lily's
sister in a coma.

01:23:06.464 --> 01:23:09.535
Lily just celebrated her 27th
birthday a few months ago.

01:23:09.536 --> 01:23:11.709
We wish her all
the success in the world.

01:23:11.710 --> 01:23:14.333
But by the sounds of
the audience out there tonight,

01:23:14.334 --> 01:23:16.814
I think she's already got that covered.

01:23:58.654 --> 01:24:00.275
We got a new driver tonight.

01:24:00.276 --> 01:24:02.346
He's got directions
to the party.

01:24:02.347 --> 01:24:04.660
Are you sure you can't come?

01:24:05.937 --> 01:24:07.627
I can't.

01:24:07.628 --> 01:24:10.390
I'm gonna hang out with a few
people from the label tonight.

01:24:11.598 --> 01:24:12.771
Too bad.

01:25:04.168 --> 01:25:05.824
Must be great.

01:25:06.929 --> 01:25:08.723
Excuse me?

01:25:08.724 --> 01:25:10.863
Thousands of adoring fans,

01:25:10.864 --> 01:25:12.278
the money,

01:25:12.279 --> 01:25:15.213
getting driven around
in a nice car like this.

01:25:16.041 --> 01:25:17.698
Yup, sure is.

01:25:19.148 --> 01:25:20.908
It wasn't always like this.

01:25:21.564 --> 01:25:22.910
Yeah, I know.

01:25:24.395 --> 01:25:27.605
You weren't Lily Glance
until you were. Right?

01:25:28.261 --> 01:25:32.505
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

01:25:32.506 --> 01:25:36.855
You know, you just reminded me of someone I
haven't thought about in a really long time.

01:25:37.925 --> 01:25:40.342
Yeah, I have that effect
on people.

01:25:41.343 --> 01:25:43.654
They say I'm one
of those faces.

01:25:43.655 --> 01:25:44.863
Know what I mean?

01:25:47.211 --> 01:25:49.833
Hey, mind driving
a little safer?

01:25:49.834 --> 01:25:51.145
I like that necklace.

01:25:51.146 --> 01:25:53.008
Where did you get it?

01:25:53.009 --> 01:25:55.218
An old ex-boyfriend
gave it to me.

01:25:55.219 --> 01:25:58.187
That's strange.
Wearing a gift from an ex.

01:25:59.188 --> 01:26:01.639
I usually dump everything
with the body.

01:26:02.053 --> 01:26:03.226
What?

01:26:03.227 --> 01:26:05.573
That's just a joke.

01:26:05.574 --> 01:26:08.162
I don't usually dump
the evidence.

01:26:08.163 --> 01:26:09.887
I incinerate it.

01:26:09.888 --> 01:26:12.476
Much harder to trace that way.

01:26:12.477 --> 01:26:15.272
That's how I did it
for you, Lily.

01:26:15.273 --> 01:26:17.171
What the fuck did you just say?

01:26:17.172 --> 01:26:22.279
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Don't distract the
driver while the vehicle is in motion.

01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:24.557
You sure were sloppy.

01:26:24.558 --> 01:26:26.525
Singers, though.

01:26:26.526 --> 01:26:29.010
Don't wanna get their hands
dirty, am I right?

01:26:29.011 --> 01:26:30.460
Fuck you!

01:26:30.461 --> 01:26:32.116
Easy, easy.

01:26:32.117 --> 01:26:36.224
I have a much better chance of
surviving this crash than you.

01:27:51.335 --> 01:27:54.095
You bitch!
Come back here!

01:27:55.718 --> 01:27:57.479
No, no, no.

01:28:13.736 --> 01:28:15.393
Hello, Lily.

01:28:16.118 --> 01:28:17.671
It's me.

01:28:26.680 --> 01:28:28.613
Lily Glance.

01:28:29.096 --> 01:28:32.514
Your debt is due.

01:28:42.524 --> 01:28:46.872
And this is Scarlet Capra
with an Action News 7 exclusive report.

01:28:46.873 --> 01:28:49.392
We are live on the scene
of a fatal car crash

01:28:49.393 --> 01:28:51.463
here on the side
of Mulholland Drive,

01:28:51.464 --> 01:28:53.396
where it appears
that the limo driver

01:28:53.397 --> 01:28:54.466
who was transporting

01:28:54.467 --> 01:28:56.364
Lily Glance
from tonight's concert

01:28:56.365 --> 01:28:58.124
lost control of the vehicle,

01:28:58.125 --> 01:29:01.473
causing it to plummet
into the ravine behind me.

01:29:01.474 --> 01:29:04.061
The driver, whose body
was thrown from the vehicle,

01:29:04.062 --> 01:29:05.511
has not yet been recovered,

01:29:05.512 --> 01:29:07.755
but authorities
have just confirmed

01:29:07.756 --> 01:29:10.723
Lily Glance was
killed on impact.

01:29:10.724 --> 01:29:12.346
Folks, if you are
just joining us,

01:29:12.347 --> 01:29:13.623
tragic news tonight.

01:29:13.624 --> 01:29:16.419
It is hard to believe
rockstar Lily Glance,

01:29:16.420 --> 01:29:18.387
dead at 27.
