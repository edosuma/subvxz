I'LL BUY THE CROCK.

08:53.567 --> 08:55.367
VIRNA. VIRNA.
VIRNA.

08:55.367 --> 08:57.700
RIGHT NOW, YOU'RE
ACTING AS DAFFY

08:57.700 --> 09:00.400
AS YOUR AUNT LUCY
WHO NOBODY SPEAKS OF.

09:00.400 --> 09:03.300
I JUST WANTED TONIGHT
TO GO WELL.

09:03.300 --> 09:05.100
WELL,
IT CAN'T GO WELL

09:05.100 --> 09:07.100
IF YOU GO RUNNING
OFF INTO THE NIGHT

09:07.100 --> 09:10.367
LIKE SOME KIND OF
CHEESE-CRAZED BANSHEE,
NOW, CAN IT?

09:10.367 --> 09:14.233
YES, IT CAN. CHEESE
CAN TURN THIS AROUND.

09:14.233 --> 09:17.200
IT'S NOT ABOUT
WHAT WE EAT, HONEY.

09:17.200 --> 09:19.300
IT'S ABOUT WHO WE ARE.

09:21.500 --> 09:25.867
AND WHO THEY ARE.
AND WE'RE DIFFERENT.

09:25.867 --> 09:27.400
AND NO AMOUNT
OF CHEESE

09:27.400 --> 09:28.467
IS GONNA CHANGE
THE FACT

09:28.467 --> 09:30.300
THAT TONIGHT IS NOT
GONNA GO WELL,

09:30.300 --> 09:33.300
AND I TOLD YOU SO.

09:33.300 --> 09:36.100
HEY. HOW WE ALL DOING?

09:36.100 --> 09:38.000
GREAT OR REALLY GREAT?

09:39.834 --> 09:43.567
SHAWN, HOW COULD YOU
LET THIS THING FALL APART
BEFORE I EVEN GET HERE?

09:43.567 --> 09:46.500
IT'S BIGGER THAN ME,
CORY. IT'S BIGGER
THAN BOTH OF US.

09:46.500 --> 09:49.367
OK. WELL, IT'S UP TO US
TO HOLD THIS THING TOGETHER.

09:49.367 --> 09:51.934
LOSE THE PURSE,
AND I'LL TAKE YOU
SERIOUSLY.

09:51.934 --> 09:53.867
BUT IT GOES WITH MY SHOES.

09:57.233 --> 09:58.700
HERE YOU GO, MOM.

10:00.100 --> 10:02.500
CHET, IS EVERYTHING
ALL RIGHT?

10:02.500 --> 10:03.734
OH, UH...

10:03.734 --> 10:05.367
YOU MEAN VIRNA?

10:05.367 --> 10:07.667
SHE'S JUST HAVING
ONE OF HER BOUTS.

10:09.467 --> 10:12.500
YOU GOT
ANY FEMALE CALMIN' PILLS
IN THAT PURSE?

10:12.500 --> 10:14.233
NOT THAT I CAN SPARE.

10:14.233 --> 10:16.100
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

10:16.100 --> 10:17.300
WELL,
THAT'S MY LIFT.

10:17.300 --> 10:19.033
THANKS FOR HAVING
ME, SERIOUSLY.

10:19.033 --> 10:20.800
SERIOUSLY, THANKS
FOR HAVING ME.

10:20.800 --> 10:23.767
NOBODY'S GETTING OFF
THIS ISLAND, GILLIGAN.

10:26.300 --> 10:29.300
WELL, HEY THERE, LUTHER.
WHAT CAN I DO YOU FOR?

10:29.300 --> 10:31.200
WE'RE HAVING
AN EMERGENCY MEETING

10:31.200 --> 10:33.700
OF THE TRAILER PARK
HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION

10:33.700 --> 10:36.834
OF WHICH WE STRONGLY FEEL
YOU SHOULD ATTEND.

10:36.834 --> 10:38.500
KIND OF BUSY
NOW, LUTHER.

10:38.500 --> 10:42.133
YOU KNOW,
ENTERTAINING
AND ALL.

10:42.133 --> 10:43.500
<i>EMERGENCY </i>MEETING.

10:43.500 --> 10:46.400
WE STRONGLY FEEL
THAT YOU SHOULD ATTEND.

10:48.300 --> 10:49.367
OH.

10:49.367 --> 10:50.200
UH, OK.

10:50.200 --> 10:51.800
UH, Y'ALL PARTY ON.

10:51.800 --> 10:54.800
DON'T LET MY ABSENCE
BE A DAMPER

10:54.800 --> 10:56.367
ON THE EVENING'S SOIREE.

10:58.467 --> 11:00.667
NOW, LUTHER, WHAT
WAS SO IMPORTANT

11:00.667 --> 11:03.400
THAT YOU HAD TO DRAG ME
AWAY FROM MY GUESTS?

11:06.200 --> 11:08.767
OH, MY STARS
AND GARTERS.

11:08.767 --> 11:11.100
YES, CHET,
IT IS I, HERBERT.

11:11.100 --> 11:15.867
UH, HERBERT, I HOPE YOU'VE
SIMPLY COME TO WISH ME
A HAPPY THANKSGIVING

11:15.867 --> 11:17.500
AND THAT I'VE
GIVEN YOU NO CAUSE

11:17.500 --> 11:19.200
TO EMERGE FROM
YOUR DEEP SECLUSION.

11:19.200 --> 11:20.934
ONCE THERE WAS
A LAND

11:20.934 --> 11:22.500
BELOW
THE FREEWAY OVERPASS

11:22.500 --> 11:24.734
NEXT TO
THE SELF-STORAGE
FACILITY.

11:24.734 --> 11:26.233
AND MEN
SAW THAT LAND,

11:26.233 --> 11:28.600
AND THEY KNEW
THAT IT WAS GOOD

11:28.600 --> 11:30.000
AND TRAILER-READY.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.834
AND SO WE
GATHERED HERE

11:31.834 --> 11:33.033
WITH OUR FAMILIES:

11:33.033 --> 11:35.400
HARD-WORKING
MEN AND WOMEN

11:35.400 --> 11:37.033
OF A COMMON PURPOSE,

11:37.033 --> 11:40.033
AND EACH FAMILY
HAVING NO MORE
OR LESS

11:40.033 --> 11:41.400
THAN HIS NEIGHBOR.

11:41.400 --> 11:44.400
THERE WAS NO ENVY,
AND THERE WAS
NO SHAME,

11:44.400 --> 11:47.100
AND, SO, THERE WAS
PEACE UPON THIS LAND

11:47.100 --> 11:48.400
UNTIL TODAY,

11:48.400 --> 11:51.834
WHERE YOU HAVE
BROUGHT OUTSIDERS
INTO OUR MIDST.

11:51.834 --> 11:54.667
COME ON, HERBERT.
THEY'RE REALLY
VERY NICE PEOPLE.

11:54.667 --> 11:56.300
THEY ARE NOT
FROM HERE,

11:56.300 --> 11:57.834
AND THEY LOOK DOWN
UPON US,

11:57.834 --> 12:00.500
AND WE
WILL NOT TOLERATE
THEIR CONDESCENSION.

12:00.500 --> 12:02.000
OH, COME ON, HERBERT.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.233
I MEAN,
I DON'T WANT TO BE

12:04.233 --> 12:06.000
OF A DIFFERENT MIND
THAN THE MULTITUDE,

12:06.000 --> 12:09.133
BUT DON'T YOU THINK
YOU'RE PRESSING
SOME EMOTIONAL HOT BUTTONS

12:09.133 --> 12:11.300
JUST TO GET
THE PEOPLE RILED UP?

12:11.300 --> 12:12.400
ENOUGH!

12:12.400 --> 12:13.900
<i>JERRY SPRINGER'S</i>
<i>ON.</i>

12:17.400 --> 12:19.934
SO, GET 'EM
OUT OF HERE, CHET.

12:19.934 --> 12:21.600
GET 'EM OUT OF HERE NOW.

12:29.200 --> 12:32.900
I HAVE CHEESE WHIZ...

12:32.900 --> 12:34.967
RICE CHEX...

12:34.967 --> 12:39.300
AND AN OLIVE
WITH A PIMENTO ON IT.

12:39.300 --> 12:40.900
PLEASE.

12:42.400 --> 12:44.500
I TOLD YOU THIS
WAS A GREAT IDEA.

12:44.500 --> 12:47.000
IT'S AN EPISODE OF<i>COPS </i>
WAITING TO HAPPEN.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.500
YOU KNOW,
CHET'S BEEN GONE
AN AWFUL LONG TIME.

12:49.500 --> 12:51.500
DO YOU THINK THERE'S
ANY KIND OF PROBLEM?

12:51.500 --> 12:54.000
OH, NO.
I'M SURE IT'S NOTHIN'.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.400
AND I WOULD JUST LIKE
TO APOLOGIZE

12:56.400 --> 12:58.800
FOR MY PREVIOUSLY
ERRATIC BEHAVIOR,

12:58.800 --> 13:02.767
AND I JUST HOPE
WE CAN GET BACK

13:02.767 --> 13:05.200
TO OUR UNEVENTFUL...

13:05.200 --> 13:07.300
WIKKI WIKKI HAWAIIAN LUAU.

13:09.100 --> 13:10.567
WHAT?

13:11.800 --> 13:13.867
WELL, I HOPE Y'ALL
ENJOYED YOUR DINNER,

13:13.867 --> 13:15.000
AND THANKS FOR COMING,

13:15.000 --> 13:16.734
AND, WELL, LET'S DO THIS
AGAIN NEXT YEAR

13:16.734 --> 13:19.100
AT SOME NEUTRAL
THIRD-PARTY AIR FORCE BASE.

13:19.100 --> 13:20.734
DAD, WE HAVEN'T
EATEN YET.

13:20.734 --> 13:22.500
UH, OF COURSE
WE HAVEN'T EATEN.

13:22.500 --> 13:25.000
WHY, OUR GUESTS
HAVE JUST ARRIVED.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.734
BUT THIS IS THE...

13:26.734 --> 13:28.700
SMALL TALK PART
OF THE EVENING,

13:28.700 --> 13:30.133
SO Y'ALL TALK,
WE'LL TALK.

13:30.133 --> 13:31.600
EVERYBODY TALK,
TALK.

13:31.600 --> 13:33.467
OUTSIDE.

13:37.367 --> 13:38.867
AH, THEM HUNTERS.

13:38.867 --> 13:41.133
QUIRKY, BUT YOU
GOTTA LOVE 'EM.

13:41.133 --> 13:42.700
YOU DID THIS TO US.

13:42.700 --> 13:45.300
I MEAN, I COULD BE
AT HOME RIGHT NOW

13:45.300 --> 13:46.734
IN MY NICE,
COMFORTABLE HOUSE,

13:46.734 --> 13:48.467
WHICH IS BUILT
INTO THE<i>GROUND,</i>

13:48.467 --> 13:49.667
BUT NO, NO, NO.

13:49.667 --> 13:50.867
SEE, YOU
HAVE TO DRAG US

13:50.867 --> 13:52.200
TO THE CENTER
OF LOONYVILLE.

13:52.200 --> 13:54.300
ERIC, ERIC, I'M SURE YOUR
BROTHER FEELS BAD ENOUGH.

13:54.300 --> 13:55.300
LET ME TALK TO HIM.

13:55.300 --> 13:56.600
THE COWBOYS, REDSKINS.

13:56.600 --> 13:58.133
THAT'S A GOOD GAME
I'M MISSING.

13:58.133 --> 14:00.734
ALAN, HE'S JUST A BOY.
HE MEANT WELL.

14:00.734 --> 14:03.200
HONEY, I KNOW
THAT SHAWN IS
YOUR BEST FRIEND,

14:03.200 --> 14:06.133
BUT WE NEVER REALLY MADE
FRIENDS WITH HIS PARENTS.

14:06.133 --> 14:07.567
YEAH, BUT WHY, MOM?

14:07.567 --> 14:09.734
I MEAN, JUST BECAUSE
WE HAVE MORE THINGS
THAN THEY DO?

14:09.734 --> 14:12.033
BECAUSE DAD MAKES MORE MONEY
THAN SHAWN'S DAD?

14:12.033 --> 14:13.867
THAT'S WHY
WE CAN'T SIT DOWN

14:13.867 --> 14:15.600
AND HAVE A NICE MEAL
TOGETHER?

14:17.734 --> 14:20.700
SON, YOU WON'T
REALIZE THIS
TILL YOU GROW UP,

14:20.700 --> 14:23.200
BUT BEING RIGHT
IS NOT NECESSARILY
ENOUGH

14:23.200 --> 14:26.400
TO CHANGE THE WAY
PEOPLE FEEL.

14:28.367 --> 14:29.600
I TOLD YOU
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN

14:29.600 --> 14:32.133
IF YOU INVITED
THEM "ARISTOCATS"
DOWN HERE, VIRNA.

14:32.133 --> 14:35.767
NOW WE HAVE OURSELVES
A REAL SITUATION HERE.

14:35.767 --> 14:37.900
SO WHAT? YOU'RE JUST
GONNA KICK MY FRIEND'S
PARENTS OUT?

14:37.900 --> 14:40.667
NO, I'M NOT GONNA
KICK YOUR FRIEND'S
PARENTS OUT.

14:40.667 --> 14:42.667
I AM, HOWEVER, GONNA
REALLY HURRY 'EM ALONG.

14:44.133 --> 14:45.967
WELL--HA HA HA--
HELLO.

14:45.967 --> 14:48.300
WHAT ARE Y'ALL
DOING OUT HERE,
OUTSIDE,

14:48.300 --> 14:50.934
WHERE YOU CAN BE SEEN
THROUGH A SCOPE?

14:50.934 --> 14:54.233
WELL, WE'RE TAKING MORGAN
OVER TO HERMAN'S TRAILER.

14:54.233 --> 14:56.100
OK. OK.
THAT'LL BE FINE.

14:56.100 --> 14:58.033
SHAWNY, WHY DON'T
YOU GO WITH THEM

14:58.033 --> 14:59.800
AND SHOW HIM
HOW WE LOCALS

14:59.800 --> 15:02.867
LIKE TO WALK REAL LOW
TO THE GROUND?

15:02.867 --> 15:05.000
YOU KNOW, FOR FUN.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.100
I'M SORRY.

15:07.100 --> 15:09.000
I'M SORRY, TOO.

15:18.900 --> 15:20.400
READY FOR YOUR PIE?

15:20.400 --> 15:22.200
I JUST GOT MY TURKEY.

15:22.200 --> 15:24.100
PLEASE DON'T TAKE THIS
THE WRONG WAY,

15:24.100 --> 15:26.400
BUT DON'T YOU THINK WE
OUGHTA WAIT FOR THE KIDS?

15:26.400 --> 15:27.967
IT'S A HUNTER
THANKSGIVING TRADITION.

15:27.967 --> 15:30.200
KIDS DON'T EAT,
AND IT'S TIME
FOR PIE.

15:30.200 --> 15:31.734
[SNAP]

15:31.734 --> 15:34.567
OH. THERE GOES MY FORK.
WHAT'S THAT MAKE? THREE?

15:34.567 --> 15:36.367
HERE. HAVE ANOTHER.

15:36.367 --> 15:41.000
OH, I GUESS IT'S GOOD
TO HAVE A BIG 'OL BAG
OF FORKS AROUND.

15:43.000 --> 15:46.367
WELL, THIS TIME, I'M GONNA
TRY AND FIND A STURDIER ONE.

15:46.367 --> 15:48.600
OR YOU COULD GO EASY
ON THE ONE YOU GOT.

15:48.600 --> 15:51.467
CHET, YOU'RE RIGHT.
WHY WASTE ANOTHER FORK?

15:51.467 --> 15:56.100
I'M JUST GONNA USE
THE LITTLE FORKY PART
OF THE ONE I GOT.

15:56.100 --> 15:57.867
CHET--AHEM--

15:57.867 --> 16:00.600
IF OUR DINNER GUEST
IS NOT COMFORTABLE
WITH OUR PLASTICWEAR,

16:00.600 --> 16:02.600
I THINK IT'S ONLY RIGHT
WE ACCOMMODATE HIM

16:02.600 --> 16:04.600
WITH A REGULAR
METAL FORK.

16:04.600 --> 16:07.500
WELL, HECK, WHY DON'T
WE JUST GIVE EVERYBODY
A METAL FORK?

16:07.500 --> 16:08.967
NO, CHET.

16:08.967 --> 16:11.600
WHY? BECAUSE
OUR FORKS DON'T MATCH?

16:11.600 --> 16:13.934
OUR FORKS DON'T MATCH.

16:13.934 --> 16:16.700
OH, YOU KNOW,
I REMEMBER SO WELL

16:16.700 --> 16:19.300
THAT OUR FORKS AND SPOONS
DIDN'T MATCH

16:19.300 --> 16:21.100
WHEN WE WERE
STARTING OUT.

16:27.367 --> 16:28.934
AHEM.

16:28.934 --> 16:31.767
CHET, VIRNA...

16:31.767 --> 16:35.900
CLEARLY...
THIS ISN'T WORKING.

16:35.900 --> 16:38.200
YOU GUYS WENT WAY OUT
OF YOUR WAY FOR US,

16:38.200 --> 16:39.734
AND WE REALLY
APPRECIATE IT.

16:39.734 --> 16:41.734
I UNDERSTAND.
IT'S NOT PERSONAL.

16:41.734 --> 16:44.033
SOMETIMES WHAT'S
IMPORTANT TO REALIZE

16:44.033 --> 16:47.033
IS SOME FOLKS JUST DON'T
BLEND TOGETHER SO WELL.

16:47.033 --> 16:49.900
YEAH. WE SHOULD JUST
LEAVE IT THAT WAY.

16:49.900 --> 16:52.400
DOESN'T MAKE IT
ANYBODY'S FAULT.

16:52.400 --> 16:55.867
I'M SURE THE KIDS
WILL UNDERSTAND.

16:58.667 --> 17:00.934
SHAWN, I'M REALLY
SORRY ABOUT
THIS WHOLE THING.

17:00.934 --> 17:03.500
I MEAN, MY PARENTS
HAVE JUST BEEN
ACTING LIKE JERKS.

17:03.500 --> 17:06.567
YEAH, WELL, MY PARENTS
DIDN'T EXACTLY
GO OUT OF THEIR WAY

17:06.567 --> 17:08.000
TO MAKE THEM
FEEL WELCOME.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.100
I GUESS THIS WHOLE THING
WAS JUST A MISTAKE.

17:10.100 --> 17:12.467
YOU KNOW, WHY CAN'T THEY
JUST HANG OUT TOGETHER?

17:12.467 --> 17:14.200
ADULTS ARE NOT
NARROW-MINDED
BY NATURE.

17:14.200 --> 17:16.967
THEY CAN,
HOWEVER, BE SET
IN THEIR WAYS.

17:16.967 --> 17:18.667
I AM BUT
A CALLOW YOUTH,

17:18.667 --> 17:20.467
YET IT SEEMS
TO ME A SHAME

17:20.467 --> 17:22.100
THEY SHOULD BE
SET IN THE WAY

17:22.100 --> 17:23.300
OF DISLIKING
EACH OTHER.

17:23.300 --> 17:25.200
THEY COME
FROM DIFFERENT WORLDS.

17:25.200 --> 17:27.667
THINK OF THEM
AS THE HUTUS AND TUTSIS,

17:27.667 --> 17:29.100
LIVING WITH PREJUDICE
AND HATRED

17:29.100 --> 17:31.000
PASSED ON
FROM PARENT TO CHILD

17:31.000 --> 17:33.100
BECAUSE IT IS WHAT
THEY'VE GROWN ACCUSTOMED TO.

17:33.100 --> 17:35.400
ARE WE
THE ONLY TWO PEOPLE
ON THIS WHOLE PLANET

17:35.400 --> 17:37.600
WHO DON'T KNOW
WHO THE HUTUS
AND TUTSIS ARE?

17:37.600 --> 17:41.734
YOU KNOW, CORY, FOR ONCE,
I THINK OUR IGNORANCE
MAY BE WORKING FOR US.

17:41.734 --> 17:44.600
WHAT? YOU MEAN
IF WE KNEW BETTER,
WE WOULDN'T BE FRIENDS?

17:44.600 --> 17:47.967
YEAH, SO I'M GLAD WE
DON'T KNOW BETTER.

17:47.967 --> 17:49.500
YEAH, ME, TOO.

17:49.500 --> 17:51.734
WELL, OUR TABLE IS IN ORDER.

17:51.734 --> 17:54.400
IT IS TIME TO PROCEED
WITH OUR HOLIDAY REPAST.

17:57.934 --> 17:59.500
ARE YOU GUYS SURE
THIS IS OK?

17:59.500 --> 18:02.567
THERE IS ALWAYS ROOM
FOR MORE AT OUR TABLE.

18:09.233 --> 18:11.233
IT IS OUR
THANKSGIVING CUSTOM

18:11.233 --> 18:15.033
TO GO AROUND THE TABLE
AND LET EACH PERSON SAY
WHAT THEY ARE THANKFUL FOR.

18:15.033 --> 18:15.900
THEN WE EAT?

18:15.900 --> 18:16.934
THEN WE EAT.

18:16.934 --> 18:19.500
I'M THANKFUL FOR THAT.
NEXT.

18:20.800 --> 18:22.000
MORE?

18:22.000 --> 18:23.400
OK.

18:23.400 --> 18:25.600
UM...I'M ALSO THANKFUL

18:25.600 --> 18:29.000
TO BE HAVING THANKSGIVING
DINNER WITH MY BROTHER

18:29.000 --> 18:30.367
AND MY SISTER

18:30.367 --> 18:31.734
AND ALL MY FRIENDS

18:31.734 --> 18:33.900
AND THAT I'M
TAPING THE GAME.

18:33.900 --> 18:35.500
NEXT.

18:35.500 --> 18:37.233
I'M THANKFUL
FOR THESE GUESTS

18:37.233 --> 18:38.600
AND THAT WE'VE BEEN BLESSED

18:38.600 --> 18:41.300
WITH ENOUGH FOOD TO SHARE
WITH THEM. HERMAN.

18:41.300 --> 18:43.667
I'M THANKFUL
TO BE SITTING...

18:43.667 --> 18:45.867
NEXT TO THIS
DELICATE BLOSSOM

18:45.867 --> 18:47.867
WHO HAS WON MY HEART.

18:47.867 --> 18:49.200
DEAREST.

18:49.200 --> 18:50.900
I AM, FOR ONCE,
THANKFUL

18:50.900 --> 18:52.934
TO BE SITTING AT
THE KIDS' TABLE.

18:52.934 --> 18:54.100
SHAWN.

18:54.100 --> 18:56.967
I'M THANKFUL THAT
YOU'RE MY FRIEND.

18:56.967 --> 18:58.467
AND I GUESS
I'M THANKFUL

18:58.467 --> 19:00.200
THAT MY PARENTS
TAUGHT ME

19:00.200 --> 19:03.567
TO LIKE PEOPLE
FOR WHO THEY
ARE...

19:03.567 --> 19:05.600
EVEN IF THEY
WEREN'T LUCKY ENOUGH

19:05.600 --> 19:08.500
TO BE RAISED
THAT WAY THEMSELVES.

19:11.400 --> 19:14.200
WELL, I FEEL
ABOUT 2 INCHES TALL.

19:14.200 --> 19:16.400
WHEW. THAT'S 2 INCHES
TALLER THAN I FEEL.

19:16.400 --> 19:18.967
MAYBE WE COULD
ALL TRY THIS
AGAIN.

19:18.967 --> 19:21.200
IT'D BE A SHAME
TO WASTE ALL THAT CHEESE.

19:22.667 --> 19:23.700
HEY, LUTHER...

19:25.033 --> 19:26.900
WHY DON'T YOU
JOIN US HERE?

19:26.900 --> 19:30.200
WE'RE HAVING
AN EMERGENCY MEETING
OF THE HUMAN RACE.

19:30.200 --> 19:33.000
AHEM. Y'ALL
HAVE ROOM FOR US?

19:34.100 --> 19:37.467
YEAH. THERE'S ALWAYS ROOM
FOR MORE AT OUR TABLE.

20:11.500 --> 20:15.233
BY AND LARGE, YOUR PAPERS
WERE ABOVE-AVERAGE.

20:15.233 --> 20:17.834
VERY GOOD WORK.

20:17.834 --> 20:21.867
WHAT, DON'T I GET MINE?
DID YOU RECYCLE IT ALREADY?

20:24.000 --> 20:25.934
CAN'T JUST FAIL ME
PRIVATELY.

20:25.934 --> 20:28.300
YOU GOTTA<i>BRAVEHEART </i>
ME UP HERE.

20:28.300 --> 20:30.000
I SIMPLY WONDERED
IF YOU WOULD MIND

20:30.000 --> 20:31.967
READING YOUR PAPER
TO THE CLASS,

20:31.967 --> 20:33.967
STARTING HERE.

20:33.967 --> 20:35.567
OK.

20:37.200 --> 20:38.667
"THIS PAST WEEK,
I SPENT THANKSGIVING

20:38.667 --> 20:41.233
"WITH THE HUTUS
AND THE TUTSIS,

20:41.233 --> 20:42.834
"WHICH WAS A REAL
SURPRISE TO ME

20:42.834 --> 20:44.500
"BECAUSE I LIVE
IN PHILADELPHIA,

20:44.500 --> 20:46.834
"AND I THOUGHT
THAT KIND OF PREJUDICE
BASED ON CLASS DIFFERENCES

20:46.834 --> 20:49.567
ONLY HAPPENED
IN UNDEVELOPED COUNTRIES."

20:50.400 --> 20:51.400
IT THAT ENOUGH?
I'M GETTING VERTIGO

20:51.400 --> 20:53.767
FROM FACING THIS WAY
IN THE ROOM.

20:53.767 --> 20:55.200
NO, NO. GO ON.

20:58.300 --> 21:00.934
"BUT I DISCOVERED
THAT EVEN IN MY VERY OWN
CIVILIZED COUNTRY,

21:00.934 --> 21:04.000
"PEOPLE CAN BE
JUST AS UNDEVELOPED
AND JUST AS CRUEL.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.300
"BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY,
AND THE THING THAT
GIVES ME HOPE,

21:06.300 --> 21:07.867
"IS THAT AS LONG
AS THE CHILDREN ARE EDUCATED

21:07.867 --> 21:10.233
"ABOUT THE DANGERS OF
PREJUDICE AND INTOLERANCE,

21:10.233 --> 21:14.700
THEN PERHAPS THERE
WILL BE A REASON FOR
THANKSGIVING IN THE FUTURE."

21:17.500 --> 21:21.367
THAT'S THE BEST WORK
YOU'VE EVER DONE,
MR. HUNTER.

21:21.367 --> 21:24.200
UM...C-MINUS.

21:24.200 --> 21:26.100
ALL RIGHT.

21:26.100 --> 21:27.767
NO.

21:27.767 --> 21:30.000
A-PLUS.

21:32.934 --> 21:35.367
I'M AS SHOCKED
AS YOU ARE.

21:37.100 --> 21:39.800
ALL RIGHT, SHAWN.
A-PLUS.

21:40.100 --> 21:42.800
I'M BETTER
THAN YOU ARE NOW.
