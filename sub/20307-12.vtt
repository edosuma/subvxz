WEBVTT

00:22.105 --> 00:23.189
Oh, Mick.

00:25.400 --> 00:26.234
Hi.

00:28.236 --> 00:29.237
You're back.

00:29.946 --> 00:31.865
I just stopped to say hello.

00:31.948 --> 00:34.117
Mm... What do you mean?

00:34.701 --> 00:35.785
I'm still working.

00:37.037 --> 00:39.247
They just let me out to say hi.

00:41.249 --> 00:42.375
Hmm.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.378
I'll see you later.

00:47.756 --> 00:48.840
I love you.

01:07.901 --> 01:09.402
Alright.

01:09.486 --> 01:10.779
Okay?

01:10.862 --> 01:12.530
Can we get back to work now?

01:12.614 --> 01:14.365
Yeah, let's get back to work.

01:19.788 --> 01:22.290
Preliminary search
didn't turn up the perp's weapon.

01:22.373 --> 01:24.334
Evidently, a cop planted a second gun.

01:24.959 --> 01:26.461
Then the perp's weapon turned up?

01:26.544 --> 01:29.672
Hmm, Goldblume found it under a dumpster.

01:29.756 --> 01:33.176
Steger says Garfield planted the gun.
Garfield says it was Steger.

01:33.259 --> 01:36.179
If it was Garfield's shoot,
why would Steger plant a weapon?

01:36.262 --> 01:37.806
That's a good question.

01:38.348 --> 01:39.557
I have the I.A.D. hearing.

01:40.225 --> 01:42.894
If I were lawyering,
I'd like to work for Steger.

01:42.977 --> 01:44.229
If you were lawyering,

01:44.312 --> 01:46.898
you'd want to be working for Garfield.
He's the underdog.

01:47.524 --> 01:50.276
Item 5 is an all-points

01:50.360 --> 01:53.154
for the renegade bridegroom,
Michael Belker.

01:53.238 --> 01:55.198
(cheering)

01:55.281 --> 01:58.493
This louse not only left
his fiancÃ©e at the altar,

01:58.576 --> 02:00.203
he left yours truly holding the ring.

02:00.286 --> 02:02.413
(laughter)

02:02.497 --> 02:06.918
Actually, Mick had to cook
on his PCP operation

02:07.001 --> 02:08.503
earlier than scheduled.

02:08.586 --> 02:11.548
Now, his undercover closes this morning.

02:11.631 --> 02:15.343
Rain date for his
and Robin Tataglia's nuptials

02:15.426 --> 02:18.972
is 5:30 this afternoon
at the Kubiak La Paloma room.

02:19.055 --> 02:20.890
-Sarge!
-What?

02:20.974 --> 02:22.517
If Belker takes a powder,

02:22.600 --> 02:25.019
does the head of the gift
committee get the refrigerator?

02:25.103 --> 02:27.230
(laughter)

02:27.313 --> 02:29.482
He ain't, he ain't takin' a powder.

02:30.692 --> 02:32.068
Item, um...

02:32.152 --> 02:34.654
(silence)

02:37.157 --> 02:38.241
Uh...

02:38.324 --> 02:42.453
Item 6, um... no perp interviews or IDs

02:42.537 --> 02:45.290
in interrogation room "A" today, people.

02:45.373 --> 02:48.459
I.A.D. is taking statements
on the Garfield shoot.

02:49.335 --> 02:50.420
Item 7,

02:50.503 --> 02:53.756
now, our worst fears
with this wildcat walkout

02:53.840 --> 02:57.177
of the "Drivers of the City
Health Department" have come true.

02:57.260 --> 03:01.014
The city health inspector Rolowitz
has declared an emergency,

03:01.097 --> 03:04.058
which means
until this wildcat strike is over,

03:04.142 --> 03:07.395
cops are gonna have to pick up
the "John Doe" stiffs.

03:07.478 --> 03:08.354
(jeering)

03:08.438 --> 03:11.482
People, I did this
the fairest way I knew--

03:11.566 --> 03:13.443
I put names in a hat, and pulled them out.

03:13.526 --> 03:17.113
Now, the names I call,
along with their partners--

03:17.197 --> 03:19.616
you're gonna be picking up croakers today.

03:20.408 --> 03:21.242
Frame.

03:21.326 --> 03:24.370
(cheering)

03:26.247 --> 03:27.081
Donaldson.

03:27.165 --> 03:29.709
(cheering)

03:30.793 --> 03:31.628
Hill.

03:31.711 --> 03:33.963
(cheers and laughter)

03:34.047 --> 03:35.256
MAN: Hey, Renko!

03:37.300 --> 03:40.386
Okay, that's it. Let's have a safe shift.

03:40.470 --> 03:42.388
Let's go! They're getting away out there!

03:44.515 --> 03:46.809
Not the ones we're gonna be
with because they're dead.

03:51.564 --> 03:52.732
How's it going Ronnie?

03:56.110 --> 03:57.862
Just waiting to make my statement.

03:59.530 --> 04:02.158
S.O.P., my man.
Steger's driving a desk, too.

04:02.242 --> 04:04.202
After today,
Steger'll be back on the streets.

04:04.285 --> 04:05.495
Where you think I'll be?

04:05.578 --> 04:07.455
Why you so sure
the hand's gonna come out against you?

04:07.538 --> 04:08.998
Who you think I.A.D. will believe,

04:09.082 --> 04:11.251
a 27-year member
of the Fraternal Order of Police

04:11.334 --> 04:12.418
or a black rookie?

04:12.502 --> 04:14.462
Ronnie, don't hang this up on color.

04:14.545 --> 04:16.172
They wanna know
what happened in that alley.

04:16.256 --> 04:18.758
There's no witnesses.
It's Steger's word against mine.

04:18.841 --> 04:21.427
And that's why they'll be looking
at how you handle yourself.

04:21.511 --> 04:22.887
The way you say what you say.

04:22.971 --> 04:26.182
If you cop out on some self-pitying crap
about color, instead of trying

04:26.266 --> 04:28.476
to make them understand
what went down out there...

04:28.559 --> 04:30.395
If I was I.A.D.,
I'd figure you were guilty.

04:30.478 --> 04:32.480
I'd figure that you planted the piece,

04:32.563 --> 04:34.065
and now you're taking your best shot

04:34.148 --> 04:36.317
at trying to make the hearing
about something else.

04:38.403 --> 04:40.363
You really think they might believe me?

04:40.446 --> 04:41.572
I didn't do it, Detective.

04:41.656 --> 04:43.950
Then that's what you got
to make <i>them </i>believe.

04:45.243 --> 04:46.744
Are you going to try, Ronnie?

04:49.205 --> 04:51.541
(whispers) Yeah. Yeah.

04:51.624 --> 04:52.792
All right.

04:55.878 --> 04:56.796
(sighs)

04:56.879 --> 04:59.507
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

04:59.590 --> 05:01.676
<i>-Armed robbery in progress.</i>
-(sirens whooping)

05:01.759 --> 05:05.471
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner of People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

05:05.555 --> 05:07.056
(theme music playing)

06:45.696 --> 06:46.989
Oh, sorry fellas.

06:47.782 --> 06:49.242
-Hello, Jim.
-Captain Gleason.

06:49.325 --> 06:51.285
-Barry.
-Hello, Frank.

06:54.038 --> 06:57.959
Do you remember that long-legged
Irish steno, Frank, um,

06:58.042 --> 07:00.711
-Cassidy.
-Cassidy, yeah. Oh!

07:02.088 --> 07:04.173
You think these recorders
are an improvement?

07:04.257 --> 07:07.593
(laughs)

07:09.011 --> 07:10.346
Start with Garfield, Captain?

07:11.139 --> 07:13.391
Off the prelims,
we could end with him, too.

07:13.474 --> 07:15.059
No prejudgments, Barry.

07:15.143 --> 07:18.354
Whoever survives the inquiry
is going to be a cop in my precinct.

07:19.147 --> 07:22.108
No prejudgments, Frank, no prejudgments.

07:23.484 --> 07:26.362
GARFIELD: <i>I figured</i>
<i>if he took off, he must have warrants,</i>

07:26.446 --> 07:28.364
<i>so I should presume he was dangerous.</i>

07:29.031 --> 07:31.284
<i>I saw him turn off Van Buren</i>
<i>into the alley,</i>

07:31.367 --> 07:32.452
<i>I continued pursuit.</i>

07:33.786 --> 07:35.872
<i>I remember thinking</i>
<i>I didn't know this alley.</i>

07:35.955 --> 07:37.665
<i>I'd never been down this alley before.</i>

07:37.748 --> 07:39.709
SHIPMAN: <i>What'd you see when you went?</i>

07:39.792 --> 07:42.545
GARFIELD: <i>The suspect turned</i>
<i>and faced me with a weapon.</i>

07:43.129 --> 07:45.798
<i>I identified myself and shot.</i>

07:45.882 --> 07:46.883
(shot)

07:48.342 --> 07:49.802
You're certain you were at risk?

07:49.886 --> 07:51.262
I was certain.

07:51.345 --> 07:53.431
He intended to shoot, so I shot.

07:53.514 --> 07:54.557
<i>The impact...</i>

07:54.640 --> 07:55.558
(gunshot)

07:55.641 --> 07:56.851
<i>...knocked him backwards.</i>

07:57.518 --> 07:59.479
<i>When I went to him, I said to myself,</i>

08:00.146 --> 08:01.689
<i>"Please don't let him be dead,"</i>

08:02.482 --> 08:04.525
<i>but I knew from the way he looked,</i>

08:05.109 --> 08:07.445
<i>there was no movement.</i>
<i>He was just lying there.</i>

08:07.528 --> 08:09.280
<i>He was absolutely still.</i>

08:09.363 --> 08:13.075
<i>There was nothing. No pulse. God, nothing.</i>

08:13.659 --> 08:15.369
So I got up to look for the gun--

08:15.453 --> 08:17.079
Was Officer Steger there by now?

08:17.163 --> 08:19.415
Not yet. He arrived a few seconds later.

08:20.124 --> 08:21.167
<i>What did Steger say?</i>

08:21.667 --> 08:23.336
GARFIELD: <i>I was looking for the gun,</i>

08:23.419 --> 08:25.588
<i>and I told him I couldn't find the gun,</i>

08:25.671 --> 08:28.549
<i>and he looked with me</i>
<i>for about 10 seconds,</i>

08:28.633 --> 08:31.260
<i>and then he told me to go back to the unit</i>

08:31.344 --> 08:32.637
<i>and call in the shoot.</i>

08:33.679 --> 08:35.556
I called the shoot in and came back

08:35.640 --> 08:38.684
with some uniform officers
from the prostitution sweep.

08:39.393 --> 08:42.730
Steger met us, and he had
a pistol by its trigger guard.

08:42.813 --> 08:44.190
Yelling he had found it.

08:44.273 --> 08:46.359
Naturally, I was real relieved.

08:46.442 --> 08:48.277
Show me where to indicate your position

08:48.361 --> 08:50.112
in relation to the perp Gomez

08:50.196 --> 08:51.906
when Officer Steger ran to the alley.

09:02.333 --> 09:04.585
(liquid sloshes)

09:04.669 --> 09:05.628
Good color, man.

09:05.711 --> 09:07.922
Bet that stuff kicks
like a mule, too, huh?

09:08.005 --> 09:10.550
(chuckles) It'll do the job.

09:10.633 --> 09:12.134
You did great, Mick.

09:12.218 --> 09:16.055
Oh, you cook some great stuff.
You're gonna be big in this business.

09:16.138 --> 09:18.432
Yeah, Mr. Suarez is gonna be
happy, too, mate.

09:18.516 --> 09:20.101
So, our meet's at 2:00?

09:20.184 --> 09:22.186
Two o'clock, sharp.

09:23.229 --> 09:25.398
Suarez is always on time, Mick.

09:27.608 --> 09:30.403
Hey, wait a minute Mick, what's this now?

09:30.486 --> 09:31.821
I'll be back before the meet.

09:33.364 --> 09:35.408
What? Don't you want me there?

09:35.491 --> 09:36.867
Yeah, we want you here.

09:36.951 --> 09:38.869
Chato's saying, "Where are you going?"

09:38.953 --> 09:42.790
Look, we didn't get married,
right, fellas?

09:42.873 --> 09:45.543
I'm going out.
I'm gonna walk around a little bit,

09:45.626 --> 09:47.169
and I'll be back before the meet.

09:48.254 --> 09:51.382
You're gonna go and see your woman
again, right, Mick? (chuckles)

09:51.465 --> 09:52.383
You got me.

09:53.134 --> 09:55.261
Philip, tonight maybe me, you, and Mick

09:55.344 --> 09:57.388
-can take our ladies out to celebrate.
-Yeah.

09:57.471 --> 09:58.431
We can go to Lotus Club.

09:58.514 --> 10:00.349
-Ever been to Lotus Club, Mick?
-No.

10:00.433 --> 10:02.059
She'll love it. It's a trip.

10:02.143 --> 10:04.854
Okay. I'll be back in a little while.

10:04.937 --> 10:06.606
-PHILIP: You got it.
-CHATO: Hey, Mick.

10:10.109 --> 10:12.486
Superstar, king of the cookers.

10:12.570 --> 10:15.823
An event subsequent to the shoot,
did you speak with Officer Steger

10:15.906 --> 10:18.034
after Furillo told you
a second gun had been found?

10:18.743 --> 10:20.494
-Yes, I did.
-What was said?

10:21.245 --> 10:22.413
I was upset.

10:22.496 --> 10:25.791
I told him I couldn't believe
the perp had two guns.

10:26.542 --> 10:29.045
I told him that if the second gun

10:29.128 --> 10:32.048
had been found in the perp's pocket,
I'd buy that,

10:32.131 --> 10:35.551
but both pieces were found in the alley,
away from the body,

10:35.635 --> 10:38.054
and I knew I'd only seen
one gun in the perp's hand.

10:38.596 --> 10:41.474
-How did Officer Steger respond?
-He got very upset.

10:41.557 --> 10:45.227
I confronted him, and asked him
if he planted that gun he found.

10:45.311 --> 10:46.854
And did he confess?

10:46.937 --> 10:51.108
He said, "If somebody did plant a piece,
they wouldn't have done it to hurt you."

10:51.192 --> 10:52.943
How did you interpret that statement?

10:53.027 --> 10:56.405
I took it to mean that Steger
had planted a gun to help me,

10:57.031 --> 10:59.116
and in turn
wanted me to lie to protect him.

10:59.200 --> 11:01.911
Did he ask you specifically
to commit perjury?

11:01.994 --> 11:05.414
What he said was, "Are you gonna be
stand-up on this or what?"

11:06.165 --> 11:08.334
I said, "I don't know."
That's where we left it.

11:08.417 --> 11:11.212
Next thing I know,
I get called in to the captain's office

11:11.295 --> 11:13.297
and Steger's there
lying through his teeth.

11:13.881 --> 11:16.801
At the time of the shooting,
Officer Garfield,

11:17.718 --> 11:20.179
how long had you known Officer Steger?

11:21.389 --> 11:22.306
About two hours.

11:22.390 --> 11:26.352
Any mutual friends, other cops
you both knew, anything like that?

11:26.936 --> 11:28.229
Not to my knowledge.

11:28.312 --> 11:30.147
Like I said, we only met that morning.

11:30.231 --> 11:31.232
Mmm.

11:32.108 --> 11:33.693
Let me see if I got this right.

11:33.776 --> 11:34.735
Um...

11:35.778 --> 11:38.364
A 27-year veteran

11:38.447 --> 11:41.826
walks into a shooting scene
and commits a felony

11:42.618 --> 11:44.620
by dropping a weapon for another cop

11:44.704 --> 11:46.997
that he just met two hours before.

11:47.081 --> 11:48.791
Is that what you're saying?

11:48.874 --> 11:51.335
Anything else you'd like to say
on your behalf at this time?

11:52.628 --> 11:55.089
Just that the perp Gomez had a gun.

11:55.172 --> 11:58.008
He pointed it at me, and I shot him,

11:58.092 --> 12:00.469
and I never dropped any weapons.

12:02.054 --> 12:04.056
-Anything else?
-No.

12:05.850 --> 12:06.934
That's all.

12:14.275 --> 12:15.109
(door closes)

12:15.693 --> 12:16.902
Case closed.

12:16.986 --> 12:18.154
The kid dropped it.

12:19.155 --> 12:21.282
A long way to go
before we say that, Barry.

12:21.365 --> 12:23.409
Nobody else had motive.

12:23.492 --> 12:26.579
I'd like to get through Steger's testimony
on the shooting before lunch.

12:29.832 --> 12:32.334
I really think you're making
a mistake here, Luce.

12:32.960 --> 12:34.503
Yeah, well, nobody asked you.

12:36.172 --> 12:39.049
You don't exactly have control
of your emotions right now.

12:39.133 --> 12:42.052
All that stuff we talked
about you wanting a family and all.

12:42.136 --> 12:45.306
Then you see Fabian's mother,
and that just made it all worse.

12:46.432 --> 12:48.309
Which has nothing to do with Hopper.

12:48.392 --> 12:50.269
I'm gonna go see him. that's it.

12:51.061 --> 12:52.354
It's up here on the left.

12:53.522 --> 12:55.191
Do you want me to hold your coat?

12:57.818 --> 12:58.986
Why?

12:59.904 --> 13:02.448
A major part of my work
is evaluating beauty.

13:02.531 --> 13:03.866
You think I'm incompetent?

13:03.949 --> 13:06.577
Yes, he is.
And the next question's gonna be,

13:06.660 --> 13:08.704
"Do you think I'm flirting?"
And, yes, he is.

13:09.955 --> 13:11.457
Give me 5 minutes, huh?

13:17.797 --> 13:19.298
Lucy, what's the matter with you?

13:20.716 --> 13:24.637
I just wanted to take one minute to tell
you the kind of person I think you are.

13:24.720 --> 13:27.431
I think you use people,
and I think you're a coward,

13:27.848 --> 13:29.934
a guy who lies to himself,
let alone other people,

13:30.017 --> 13:32.394
I think you must have been
the worst husband in the world.

13:33.479 --> 13:35.564
I think you're cheap with your emotions,

13:35.648 --> 13:37.274
you're totally joyless,

13:38.692 --> 13:41.028
and I think you're a lousy lover.

13:43.864 --> 13:45.658
And I don't like your pots!

13:45.741 --> 13:47.284
(ceramic shatters)

13:47.368 --> 13:48.244
(pulsating tone)

13:48.327 --> 13:51.705
Lorna, she made many a man happy.

13:52.498 --> 13:53.916
That woman was a hooker?

13:54.625 --> 13:55.835
Died on the job.

13:55.918 --> 13:58.087
Actually, she was the queen of phone sex.

13:58.754 --> 14:01.882
Could Lorna talk! I swear, you'd listen
to her, close your eyes,

14:01.966 --> 14:05.344
you'd think it was a 20-year-old starlet
with a middle-aged woman's dirty mind.

14:05.427 --> 14:07.972
Sounds like you're pretty familiar
with her services, pal.

14:08.055 --> 14:11.892
Well, sometimes I'd bring up her meals,
might hang around a little bit.

14:11.976 --> 14:13.394
That's no crime, is it?

14:13.477 --> 14:15.145
I can't seem to get this phone--

14:15.229 --> 14:18.107
-Would you just, yeah, please.
-Just leave--

14:18.190 --> 14:20.192
Yeah, just take it off. Come on, Renko.

14:20.276 --> 14:22.069
You ready? On 3--

14:22.152 --> 14:24.280
1, 2, 3.

14:24.363 --> 14:26.657
(both groaning)

14:27.408 --> 14:28.409
(crash)

14:28.492 --> 14:31.787
Okay, now, wait! Lie her down.

14:31.871 --> 14:33.581
Wouldn't figure you'd have
any trouble doing that.

14:33.664 --> 14:34.748
Ready? Now.

14:34.832 --> 14:35.958
(groans)

14:36.667 --> 14:37.501
Whoa!

14:37.585 --> 14:38.836
(grunting)

14:38.919 --> 14:40.504
Renko, rigor mortis!

14:40.588 --> 14:43.340
Alright, we're just gonna
take her down like she is.

14:47.803 --> 14:49.930
(telephones ring)

14:50.014 --> 14:50.973
What is that?

14:51.557 --> 14:54.101
Heavy as she was,
Lorna liked phones all over the room.

14:54.184 --> 14:55.561
That must be a customer.

14:56.562 --> 14:59.648
I don't care. I'm not even here.

14:59.732 --> 15:01.859
I'm up in the mountains somewhere fishing.

15:01.942 --> 15:03.861
I don't care one thing about this.

15:03.944 --> 15:05.779
Watch it. Watch it.

15:05.863 --> 15:07.781
Get it through the door!

15:07.865 --> 15:11.118
Get it through the door!

15:11.201 --> 15:13.454
-(thud)
-There we go. Okay, okay.

15:19.919 --> 15:21.545
STEGER: <i>I was going as hard as I could.</i>

15:21.629 --> 15:23.964
<i>No way I was gonna catch them.</i>
<i>They were pulling a pretty good lead.</i>

15:24.048 --> 15:25.591
<i>And I didn't lose theem</i>

15:25.674 --> 15:28.636
<i>till Garfield followed</i>
<i>the perp into the alley.</i>

15:28.719 --> 15:30.554
<i>-A second after that I heard the shot.</i>
-(shot)

15:30.638 --> 15:33.641
How much time passed between the shot
and when you next saw Garfield?

15:35.100 --> 15:37.311
Oh, 10, 15 seconds.

15:37.394 --> 15:39.229
Like I say, they were pretty far ahead.

15:39.313 --> 15:41.523
What did you see
when you went in the alley?

15:42.066 --> 15:44.234
STEGER: <i>Well, I saw the kid</i>
<i>over near the dumpster.</i>

15:44.318 --> 15:46.528
<i>My first thought was,</i>
<i>"Boy, am I relieved."</i>

15:46.612 --> 15:48.906
<i>You know, the guy is down</i>
<i>and my partner's on his feet.</i>

15:48.989 --> 15:52.785
<i>And then Garfield sees me.</i>
<i>That's when the curtain goes up.</i>

15:53.869 --> 15:56.246
-What?
-That's when he starts his performance.

15:56.330 --> 16:00.000
-Just state what you saw, Officer.
-(sighs) I say, uh...

16:00.084 --> 16:02.670
"Ronnie, is he dead?"

16:03.170 --> 16:04.338
<i>"He's dead!" The kid yells.</i>

16:04.421 --> 16:06.507
<i>"I shot him!</i>
<i>Oh, my God, where's his gun?!"</i>

16:07.549 --> 16:09.927
I said, "It's okay, calm down.
We'll find it."

16:10.844 --> 16:13.597
<i>Anyway, um, the kid's throwin'</i>
<i>things around</i>

16:13.681 --> 16:15.099
<i>and saying, "It's gotta be here!"</i>

16:15.182 --> 16:17.226
<i>I figure he's just gonna</i>
<i>queer the search site,</i>

16:17.309 --> 16:19.895
<i>so I sent him off to call it in.</i>

16:19.979 --> 16:21.647
Then I started a methodical search.

16:22.982 --> 16:24.024
I find the weapon...

16:25.776 --> 16:27.111
Right where Garfield,

16:28.153 --> 16:29.113
no editorializing.

16:30.406 --> 16:31.657
Morning, Nydorf.

16:31.740 --> 16:32.700
Be with you in a second.

16:32.783 --> 16:34.910
We ain't got a second.
Where do you want this stiff?

16:34.994 --> 16:37.913
Well, dealer's choice, fellas,
main performers ain't particular.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.456
Over there, Renko.

16:39.540 --> 16:42.001
Stiffened up on 'em a little
bit, didn't you, sweetheart?

16:42.876 --> 16:44.878
You got no problem, Teasdale.

16:44.962 --> 16:47.006
The woman was pretty upset, Mr. Nydorf.

16:47.089 --> 16:49.675
Oh. Look, you shoot her
through the grease a little.

16:49.758 --> 16:51.051
Uh, this the mother?

16:51.135 --> 16:52.678
Daughter O.D.'d.

16:52.761 --> 16:53.887
Oh...

16:54.513 --> 16:58.017
"Ah, Mrs. So-and-so,
strange as it may seem to you,

16:58.100 --> 17:02.604
we at Nydorf Brothers Mortuary
consider the common agate marble

17:02.688 --> 17:05.649
the best implant following
corneal donation.

17:06.191 --> 17:08.694
Keeps the natural contour of the face,

17:08.777 --> 17:12.031
and what a generous gesture
for your daughter to have made."

17:12.114 --> 17:14.658
I'm just raising the flag, Mr. Nydorf.

17:14.742 --> 17:16.285
She said she was suing us.

17:16.368 --> 17:19.288
I'm back in public service, Teasdale.

17:19.371 --> 17:22.332
This is something you ought to be able
to take care of yourself,

17:22.416 --> 17:25.753
and will you for God's sake
stop at Hopkinson Supply

17:25.836 --> 17:28.213
and pick up a bunch of ball implants?

17:28.297 --> 17:30.174
I did that on my way down here.

17:30.257 --> 17:32.885
Thank you, Teasdale.
You're a great American.

17:32.968 --> 17:34.386
Waste of good marbles.

17:34.470 --> 17:36.180
You fellas are too delicate.

17:36.889 --> 17:38.182
(bone cracks)

17:38.265 --> 17:40.059
You guys are from the hill, right?

17:40.142 --> 17:42.644
(chuckles)
Told your captain three years ago

17:42.728 --> 17:44.313
when I had my little difficulty,

17:44.396 --> 17:46.940
the city morgue hadn't seen
the last of Wally Nydorf.

17:47.024 --> 17:49.526
I wouldn't call logging in bodies
till the strike's settled

17:49.610 --> 17:52.029
exactly comin' back in honor, Wally.

17:52.112 --> 17:56.283
(laughs) Listen, Coroner Fukumoto
is an honorable man.

17:56.366 --> 17:58.285
Fukumoto won't cross the picket line.

17:58.368 --> 17:59.995
-(grunts)
-(bones crack)

18:01.038 --> 18:03.165
Wally Nydorf's got his foot in the door,

18:03.248 --> 18:06.126
and who knows,
once that extremity's inside,

18:06.210 --> 18:08.212
what other body parts may follow?

18:09.797 --> 18:10.881
(groans)

18:10.964 --> 18:13.592
Alright, can we just get out of here now?

18:13.675 --> 18:15.803
Oh, listen,
would you hold on just a minute?

18:15.886 --> 18:17.012
Now what?

18:18.597 --> 18:21.683
Lunchtime. As long as you fellas are here,

18:21.767 --> 18:24.478
maybe you can walk old Wally
through the pickets out there.

18:24.561 --> 18:27.147
I hate being on the same side as you,
Mr. Nydorf.

18:27.689 --> 18:29.608
Look, I appreciate your sentiments

18:29.691 --> 18:31.902
because you expressed them reasonably,

18:31.985 --> 18:34.238
whereas those fellas are fanatics.

18:35.531 --> 18:37.157
You weren't dreaming.

18:37.241 --> 18:39.618
No, I had those dealers drive me over.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.372
Listen, I got a couple things
at the precinct.

18:43.455 --> 18:46.375
I'll come by and change.
We can drive to The Kubiak together.

18:48.293 --> 18:49.795
Just a couple things.

18:50.879 --> 18:53.632
Honey, some loose ends off my desk.

18:55.008 --> 18:56.385
I gotta go. I love you.

18:56.468 --> 18:57.553
Bye.

19:00.264 --> 19:01.557
Coffee, Stan?

19:01.640 --> 19:03.308
No, it's bad for my ticker.

19:03.392 --> 19:04.935
Oh, come on, come on.

19:06.687 --> 19:08.438
How'd things go with I.A.D.?

19:08.522 --> 19:11.066
(exhales) Ah, still going.

19:11.859 --> 19:13.068
We're on a break.

19:13.152 --> 19:15.529
Hey, I'm telling it how it was.

19:16.071 --> 19:17.114
I hope it works out.

19:18.115 --> 19:20.325
Stan, you know, I hate to say it.

19:20.409 --> 19:22.286
I've worked with them for years--

19:22.369 --> 19:26.206
but when the going gets rough,
they all of them run scared.

19:26.707 --> 19:27.541
All of who?

19:28.458 --> 19:29.293
The colored.

19:31.086 --> 19:31.920
I don't buy that.

19:32.671 --> 19:34.756
-Right, I know.
-No, I mean it.

19:34.840 --> 19:36.008
Sure.

19:36.091 --> 19:37.384
Jack, I really mean that.

19:37.467 --> 19:38.635
Hey, I believe you.

19:41.305 --> 19:43.891
Run it for me, Mick.
I have to get back to the hearing.

19:43.974 --> 19:45.893
Well, I'm going back there after we talk.

19:45.976 --> 19:49.563
And, Suarez, their buyer,
picks up the stuff I made at 2:00.

19:49.646 --> 19:52.566
Give me a couple of minutes to establish
intent, then you make the pop.

19:52.649 --> 19:54.401
Trying to think of a way
to get you out beforehand.

19:54.484 --> 19:56.403
Uh, that's no good, Captain.

19:56.486 --> 19:58.197
We're getting you married today, Mick.

19:58.280 --> 20:01.116
They need me there to show the Dominicans
they got a chemist.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.368
I'm not there, it's gonna get hinky.

20:03.452 --> 20:06.622
Look, we bust them at 2:00,
the kids don't get married till 5:30.

20:06.705 --> 20:07.873
It lays out okay to me.

20:07.956 --> 20:09.791
(sighs)

20:09.875 --> 20:10.751
Okay.

20:10.834 --> 20:12.628
Okay. See you at two.

20:14.171 --> 20:15.255
Who's with you?

20:15.339 --> 20:17.049
Larue, Washington, four uniforms.

20:17.132 --> 20:18.091
Take six.

20:19.426 --> 20:20.469
(clears throat)

20:21.011 --> 20:23.722
What communication, if any,
did you have with Officer Garfield

20:23.805 --> 20:26.183
subsequent to the discovery
of the second gun?

20:26.266 --> 20:29.269
Most of us were out
looking for that heart.

20:29.353 --> 20:32.606
I came back to the station house.
The kid was waiting for me.

20:32.689 --> 20:33.982
Garfield?

20:34.066 --> 20:35.025
Right.

20:35.567 --> 20:38.820
(sighs)
I'm not makin' a racial joke, um...

20:39.905 --> 20:42.241
the kid looked about as pale
as he was ever gonna.

20:46.078 --> 20:49.248
Uh, he took me aside and said,
"We gotta talk."

20:50.123 --> 20:51.667
We went into interrogation,

20:52.584 --> 20:55.796
and he said, "They found
another gun at my shoot."

20:56.380 --> 20:58.215
I said, "You mean the perp had two guns?"

20:58.298 --> 21:01.718
Suddenly he started pounding
his fists on the walls,

21:01.802 --> 21:04.388
and he said, "I wish I'd have
thought to say that!

21:04.471 --> 21:06.223
Wish I'd have thought to say that."

21:06.306 --> 21:07.808
I'm getting sick at my stomach.

21:07.891 --> 21:10.519
I said, "Kid, you mean you planted a piece

21:10.602 --> 21:12.896
and set me up to find it?
You made me a patsy?"

21:14.064 --> 21:16.441
He said, "I began doubting
what I thought I'd seen.

21:16.525 --> 21:17.693
I knew you were coming."

21:18.735 --> 21:20.821
And now he's bawling his eyes out.

21:20.904 --> 21:24.157
(exhales)
He said, "The captain gave me a way out.

21:24.241 --> 21:27.494
He asked me, he said,
'Did the perp have two guns?'

21:27.577 --> 21:29.246
I didn't think to say yes."

21:30.998 --> 21:32.457
I'm gonna call The Kubiak.

21:39.256 --> 21:40.674
Hey, Ron.

21:40.757 --> 21:42.050
How'd it go, man?

21:42.884 --> 21:45.345
I couldn't tell about Furillo
or the I.A.D. guy,

21:45.429 --> 21:47.431
-but the outside captain--
-Gleason?

21:47.514 --> 21:48.765
He didn't believe word one.

21:48.849 --> 21:50.976
Steger's in with them now, lying.

21:52.144 --> 21:55.355
What do you think if I offered
a polygraph, if Steger would, too?

21:55.439 --> 21:57.733
Why would Steger do something
that could only jam him?

21:57.816 --> 21:58.692
Why would you?

21:59.443 --> 22:00.736
Ronnie, do yourself a favor.

22:00.819 --> 22:01.987
-What's that?
-Go home.

22:02.070 --> 22:03.989
You can't do nothing for yourself here.

22:04.072 --> 22:05.782
I keep thinking about what he's saying.

22:06.450 --> 22:09.036
Go home, Ronnie. Wait to hear, okay?

22:10.287 --> 22:12.622
I know, I know, I know,
you got a lodge to run,

22:12.706 --> 22:13.874
but that's not the point.

22:13.957 --> 22:16.668
The point is the wedding's at 5:00,
and all you can think about

22:16.752 --> 22:19.338
is the fridge is blocking
the way to your men's room.

22:20.422 --> 22:23.425
Leon, it's only four more hours.

22:23.508 --> 22:24.593
Have a heart.

22:24.676 --> 22:27.304
(dial tone)

22:27.387 --> 22:28.263
Leon.

22:28.347 --> 22:29.848
Real sentimental guy, huh?

22:29.931 --> 22:30.891
(exhales)

22:30.974 --> 22:32.184
How's your boy?

22:32.267 --> 22:33.185
Freaked.

22:34.353 --> 22:36.271
Maybe you got your dough
on the wrong horse.

22:36.355 --> 22:38.398
Mm-mm, I don't think so, babe.

22:42.361 --> 22:45.405
You know, I just couldn't
help but feel bad for him. I...

22:46.490 --> 22:50.243
I told him, I said,
"You didn't say there were two guns

22:50.327 --> 22:52.788
because you didn't see two guns.
Stop it here."

22:53.413 --> 22:55.207
Go to the captain. Tell him what happened.

22:55.665 --> 22:57.250
He said, "I don't think I can."

22:57.334 --> 23:00.212
I said, "Do it. You're not cut out
to play it the other way."

23:01.838 --> 23:03.590
(clears throat) Officer Steger...

23:05.384 --> 23:06.593
by your account,

23:07.344 --> 23:12.474
Officer Garfield stated his actions
were motivated by his fear, by panic.

23:12.557 --> 23:13.392
Right.

23:13.475 --> 23:16.186
You also said you were about here

23:16.269 --> 23:17.771
when you heard the shot fired.

23:17.854 --> 23:19.439
Yes, right.

23:19.523 --> 23:22.025
What would you estimate
the maximum amount of time

23:22.109 --> 23:24.319
it took you to arrive at the scene?

23:24.403 --> 23:26.154
I was running pretty hard. I don't know.

23:26.238 --> 23:28.698
-Less than a minute?
-Way less, yeah.

23:28.782 --> 23:32.035
30 seconds? I mean,
the distance is less than 30 yards.

23:32.119 --> 23:35.038
-I guess 20 seconds.
-Garfield knew you were this close?

23:36.540 --> 23:43.088
(exhales, gulps) Uh... Wait a second.
I'm not sure what you're saying.

23:43.171 --> 23:46.633
Okay, so we're back
at the scene of the crime.

23:47.717 --> 23:51.430
Now, Garfield is so panicked
that he plants a gun

23:51.513 --> 23:54.057
in the mistaken belief that
the perp had no weapon.

23:55.767 --> 23:57.602
Right. How many times we gonna
go over this?

23:57.686 --> 23:59.980
And having crouched down at the body

24:00.063 --> 24:01.731
to put the perp's prints on the weapon,

24:01.815 --> 24:04.192
and knowing you're about
to come around the corner

24:04.276 --> 24:05.318
at any instant,

24:05.402 --> 24:07.362
instead of leaving the gun
in the perp's hand,

24:07.446 --> 24:08.780
after he'd planted it there,

24:08.864 --> 24:12.159
and saying,
"There's his gun, there's the piece,"

24:12.742 --> 24:14.703
when you arrive. Instead of doing that,

24:15.412 --> 24:18.373
he risks your coming around
the corner and seeing him,

24:19.332 --> 24:21.960
he prolongs his time at risk

24:22.461 --> 24:25.547
by removing the gun from the perp's hand
and throwing it under a dumpster.

24:27.007 --> 24:28.008
Right.

24:28.592 --> 24:31.011
Then he has the further calculation,

24:31.094 --> 24:32.971
at a time when,
according to your testimony,

24:33.054 --> 24:34.723
he's totally panicked,

24:34.806 --> 24:36.308
to pretend he can't find the weapon.

24:36.391 --> 24:37.976
You asked me what happened.

24:38.059 --> 24:41.313
I told you what I saw.
I told you what the kid told me.

24:43.982 --> 24:45.025
Thank you.

24:47.986 --> 24:50.947
Do you have anything further
to add to your testimony, Officer Steger?

24:52.073 --> 24:53.283
What do you mean?

24:53.366 --> 24:54.201
No.

24:55.243 --> 24:56.953
I mean, what are you saying?

24:59.915 --> 25:01.374
Are you accusing me?

25:02.876 --> 25:04.294
I don't have any more questions.

25:15.764 --> 25:17.307
The kid planted a piece.

25:17.390 --> 25:18.725
He set me up to find it.

25:20.227 --> 25:22.729
I mean, uh... what does he got to lose?

25:22.812 --> 25:24.523
If I don't find it, he'll find it later.

25:25.357 --> 25:26.566
That's a good point.

25:27.442 --> 25:29.110
Thanks for your testimony, Officer.

25:31.613 --> 25:33.031
It's no problem.

25:34.950 --> 25:37.118
(telephone ringing)

26:04.271 --> 26:06.648
THEODORE: I don't understand
what this is about, Jimmy.

26:06.731 --> 26:08.483
So explain it to me, Theodore, huh?

26:08.942 --> 26:09.901
We're closed, man!

26:09.985 --> 26:11.152
What is this?

26:11.861 --> 26:13.738
What's going on?

26:13.822 --> 26:15.240
-This your cooker?
-No way.

26:15.323 --> 26:17.826
-Hey, I'm here to buy and sell--
-You're lyin', man!

26:18.535 --> 26:19.744
Think I don't inventory?

26:20.161 --> 26:22.163
Think I don't see you guys
shaping to make a move?

26:22.247 --> 26:25.125
You're gonna move with Suarez, ain't ya?
When's he gonna show up?

26:25.208 --> 26:26.626
I don't know
why you're talking like this, Jimmy!

26:26.710 --> 26:29.045
He watched this place last night.

26:29.129 --> 26:30.880
You guys cooked here.

26:30.964 --> 26:32.716
This guy's your cooker!

26:32.799 --> 26:33.800
-(shot)
-(shouting)

26:33.883 --> 26:34.968
You see this, Jimmy?

26:35.885 --> 26:37.512
You stopped being careful.

26:38.013 --> 26:40.307
You got to be too much of a big shot.

26:40.390 --> 26:41.558
You just made a bad mistake.

26:42.142 --> 26:43.977
<i>You </i>made the mistake-- <i>you </i>did!

26:44.644 --> 26:46.813
Now, we got ourselves an ace cooker here,

26:46.896 --> 26:48.481
and we're making our move now.

26:48.565 --> 26:49.858
You taking me out, Chato?

26:50.400 --> 26:51.818
You think you take me out,

26:51.901 --> 26:53.445
no one's gonna be after you?

26:53.528 --> 26:55.322
You think Suarez is gonna trust you

26:55.405 --> 26:57.198
after you take out your own boss?

26:57.282 --> 26:58.867
It's a big country, man.

26:59.576 --> 27:00.619
Come on, Mick.

27:00.702 --> 27:01.745
Move!

27:01.828 --> 27:02.704
Come on where?

27:02.787 --> 27:04.289
-You're comin' with us.
-Move it!

27:06.875 --> 27:08.960
You wanna cook? You stay here and cook--

27:09.044 --> 27:10.086
Mick, you stand with us.

27:10.170 --> 27:11.921
Wait a minute. Oh!

27:12.005 --> 27:13.923
Man, what'd you do?

27:14.007 --> 27:16.426
Don't worry about him!
I know where to do it. He'll be okay.

27:16.509 --> 27:18.470
All right. Lie down, Jimmy.

27:18.553 --> 27:19.638
Lay down!

27:20.180 --> 27:22.557
Animal, dog, you! Lie down!!

27:23.141 --> 27:24.392
Don't kill us, man.

27:24.476 --> 27:25.977
We ain't gonna kill you, man.

27:26.478 --> 27:27.395
We got the car?

27:27.479 --> 27:29.522
Yeah, everything's in there.
Let's go, man!

27:31.566 --> 27:32.692
Stay down!

27:36.488 --> 27:37.739
FRANK: Doesn't make sense.

27:37.822 --> 27:40.283
A panicky Garfield just does not do

27:40.367 --> 27:43.328
all the things Steger says he did
in that amount of time.

27:43.411 --> 27:47.582
Supposing Steger didn't get to the site
as quickly as he says he did, Captain?

27:47.666 --> 27:50.418
Yeah. It's human nature, Frank.

27:50.502 --> 27:53.963
Steger's pushing what, 50?
He's overweight.

27:54.047 --> 27:56.549
So he fibs
about how quick he got to the shoot.

27:56.633 --> 27:58.968
Instead of 15 or 20 seconds, it's 40.

27:59.803 --> 28:02.180
If 40 seconds, do you buy Garfield
stashing the weapon?

28:02.972 --> 28:03.848
I still don't buy it.

28:03.932 --> 28:05.225
Joseph and Mary!

28:05.308 --> 28:06.434
(exhales)

28:06.518 --> 28:09.646
Barry, it's too risky
and elaborate a set of judgments

28:09.729 --> 28:11.147
for Garfield to have made.

28:11.231 --> 28:13.650
If he's planting a gun
and knows Steger's coming,

28:13.733 --> 28:16.653
he plants the gun in the perp's hand
and backs off fast.

28:16.736 --> 28:17.612
Alright.

28:18.822 --> 28:20.740
Then you've gotta answer me one, Frank.

28:20.824 --> 28:22.784
-Why?
-Why what?

28:22.867 --> 28:26.037
Off what you're saying,
it's gotta be Steger planted the piece

28:26.121 --> 28:28.039
when he sent Garfield
out of the alley, right?

28:28.123 --> 28:30.667
-Which is Garfield's position.
-And I want to know why.

28:32.085 --> 28:33.128
(sighs)

28:33.211 --> 28:36.423
Wrongheaded idea
about standing up for another cop.

28:37.799 --> 28:39.259
Now, look.

28:39.968 --> 28:43.304
I don't want anybody
taking this wrong, okay?

28:44.556 --> 28:47.225
We're talking about a colored rookie here,

28:48.059 --> 28:50.854
a kid that Steger has never met.

28:50.937 --> 28:53.815
Now, Steger's not gonna put
his life on the line

28:53.898 --> 28:55.191
for this kid, Frank.

28:55.275 --> 28:57.485
I think Captain's saying
Steger wasn't doing it for Garfield.

28:57.569 --> 29:00.530
He's saying Steger did it out
of some misguided loyalty to another cop,

29:00.613 --> 29:02.991
rookie, black, first day partnered or not.

29:03.074 --> 29:04.492
Meaning he sold you, huh?

29:04.576 --> 29:05.702
I'm not sure.

29:06.286 --> 29:08.413
Steger is a career patrolman.

29:09.497 --> 29:11.374
Maybe he feels he's been
passed up unfairly.

29:11.458 --> 29:13.501
Maybe he has a victim's complex.

29:13.585 --> 29:14.836
Aw, come on.

29:14.919 --> 29:17.005
The ice is getting pretty thin here now.

29:17.088 --> 29:18.965
Barry, neither one of us
was in that alley.

29:19.048 --> 29:21.885
I'm just trying to support a gut reaction
here. Same as you.

29:21.968 --> 29:23.386
I don't believe Steger's story.

29:23.470 --> 29:25.263
And I don't believe Garfield's.

29:27.182 --> 29:28.600
Truck driver's next.

29:30.685 --> 29:33.646
TRUCK DRIVER: <i>I was leaning out,</i>
<i>looking back, checking my clearance,</i>

29:33.730 --> 29:36.149
<i>when I seen this guy</i>
<i>come running into the alley.</i>

29:36.232 --> 29:38.276
<i>And a cop's running, chasing him.</i>

29:38.359 --> 29:41.905
<i>I figured I better get out of there</i>
<i>when I seen him in the rear view.</i>

29:41.988 --> 29:44.866
<i>He stops, and he pulls a gun</i>
<i>out of his pants.</i>

29:44.949 --> 29:46.409
<i>Well, that's when I take off.</i>

29:46.951 --> 29:48.286
<i>When I turned out of the alley--</i>

29:48.369 --> 29:50.246
-(shot)
<i>-I heard a gunshot.</i>

29:50.330 --> 29:52.457
<i>Then I saw this lady cop.</i>

29:52.957 --> 29:55.251
Could you indicate
where you first saw the officer?

29:55.335 --> 29:56.544
Yeah.

29:57.212 --> 29:59.839
Right here,
with a hooker she was arresting.

30:00.590 --> 30:03.426
<i>I stop, I tell her there's</i>
<i>a shooting in the alley.</i>

30:03.510 --> 30:06.763
<i>She starts running towards the alley,</i>
<i>shouts back to me to tell this other cop.</i>

30:06.846 --> 30:09.516
-FURILLO: <i>Which you did?</i>
-DRIVER: <i>While she was still running.</i>

30:10.099 --> 30:12.519
Did you observe the nametag
of the female officer?

30:12.602 --> 30:14.646
Yeah. It was Willy...

30:14.729 --> 30:16.648
-Wiley... Something like--
-Officer Wiley.

30:16.731 --> 30:18.817
-Wiley, right.
-So, from what you're saying,

30:18.900 --> 30:20.902
she must've had a view of the alley
before her partner did.

30:20.985 --> 30:23.363
Right. He was still running
when she was already looking

30:23.446 --> 30:25.532
around the corner to see
where the shot came from.

30:25.615 --> 30:29.160
This was after the shooting.
She wouldn't have seen the shooting.

30:31.329 --> 30:32.747
Thank you, Mr. Kazar.

30:34.332 --> 30:35.750
(telephone rings)

30:35.834 --> 30:37.377
What is he doing here?

30:37.460 --> 30:38.795
-Who?
-Him.

30:38.878 --> 30:40.213
Who?

30:40.296 --> 30:41.923
It's Tom Hopper, the potter.

30:42.006 --> 30:43.258
WOMAN: Can I help you, sir?

30:43.716 --> 30:45.051
He looks like a wimp.

30:45.134 --> 30:47.011
I'm sorry, you can't file a complaint.

30:47.095 --> 30:48.513
Then who should I speak to?

30:48.596 --> 30:49.889
Yeah, what's the problem?

30:51.349 --> 30:54.394
I want to file a complaint
against an Officer Bates.

30:54.477 --> 30:56.938
Ah. I'm the man you want to talk to.

30:57.605 --> 30:59.107
Now, what's the problem?

30:59.190 --> 31:02.944
Well, I previously knew Officer Bates
on a personal basis,

31:03.027 --> 31:06.406
which gives her no excuse
for behaving like a thug.

31:06.489 --> 31:08.032
(indistinct conversations)

31:09.534 --> 31:11.661
She comes into a ceramics
studio I operate,

31:11.744 --> 31:13.663
terrifies the students, breaks things--

31:13.746 --> 31:16.040
What you mean, terrifying students?
What's that mean?

31:16.124 --> 31:19.544
-I just said her behavior was disruptive.
-Did she take out her gun?

31:19.627 --> 31:21.296
Was she arresting people? What?

31:22.630 --> 31:25.466
Look, I get the feeling you're not
the person I should be talking to.

31:25.550 --> 31:27.302
No. I get the feeling

31:27.385 --> 31:29.721
that Lucy didn't come to see you as a cop.

31:29.804 --> 31:31.598
She came to you for personal reasons.

31:31.681 --> 31:33.892
And you weren't man enough
to talk to her face to face,

31:33.975 --> 31:36.185
so you come in here
with all this whiny crap

31:36.269 --> 31:38.730
trying to embarrass her at her job,
thinking that maybe

31:38.813 --> 31:40.315
that'll keep her
from coming to see you again.

31:40.398 --> 31:42.275
Look, I'm not gonna be intimidated by you.

31:42.358 --> 31:45.111
Hey, I'm not trying to intimidate you.
You still want to file a complaint,

31:45.194 --> 31:47.071
or did you accomplish
what you came here for?

31:47.155 --> 31:49.616
I don't want a repeat
of what happened this morning.

31:50.116 --> 31:52.869
If I'm getting the message
that you don't think it'll be repeated,

31:52.952 --> 31:55.622
-then a complaint isn't necessary.
-Well, that's the message.

31:55.705 --> 31:57.040
Thanks very much.

31:57.916 --> 31:59.876
You're welcome, Duke.

31:59.959 --> 32:00.960
Stan...

32:02.629 --> 32:04.839
Health department drivers just settled.

32:04.923 --> 32:07.425
Hallelujah! I'll notify our people.

32:07.508 --> 32:08.760
Thanks.

32:08.843 --> 32:12.180
Stan, could you raise Officer Wiley
for me please? We want to talk to her.

32:12.263 --> 32:14.641
I'd like a copy of her statement
about the Garfield case.

32:14.724 --> 32:15.725
Got it.

32:17.977 --> 32:19.395
What was that about?

32:19.479 --> 32:22.440
Um, they want to talk to Officer Wiley.

32:22.523 --> 32:23.399
Wiley, huh?

32:24.150 --> 32:26.027
Your wife called
while you were downstairs.

32:26.110 --> 32:27.362
That's all I needed.

32:27.445 --> 32:29.322
She just wanted to know
how things are going.

32:29.405 --> 32:32.200
She's just been climbing all
over me about this thing.

32:32.283 --> 32:34.535
-It's gonna be over soon.
-I'll tell you what's over,

32:34.619 --> 32:37.163
my shot at a promotion
before I get my benefits.

32:37.246 --> 32:40.249
27 years, I'll be going out on
a patrolman's pension.

32:41.334 --> 32:44.337
Well, if they clear you,
how's this going to affect your promotion?

32:44.420 --> 32:45.797
Stan, believe me,

32:45.880 --> 32:48.049
I've been a guy who never played the game.

32:48.132 --> 32:49.968
I've always wound up on the short end.

32:51.177 --> 32:53.596
This is the kind of thing
they've been using for 27 years!

32:54.806 --> 32:55.932
Jack,

32:56.015 --> 32:57.934
you mind if I tell you
something as a friend?

32:58.017 --> 32:58.851
Yeah, shoot.

32:58.935 --> 33:00.561
Self-pity stinks.

33:01.396 --> 33:02.647
What's that supposed to mean?

33:02.730 --> 33:06.275
It means maybe there are other reasons
why you didn't get any promotions.

33:06.359 --> 33:07.860
Oh, you don't believe that.

33:07.944 --> 33:09.153
And that's something else.

33:09.237 --> 33:11.990
Don't think you always know
what somebody else is thinking.

33:12.073 --> 33:14.951
-Oh, uh, Officer Wiley--
-Stan--

33:15.034 --> 33:18.121
Excuse me. Uh, Officer Wiley...

33:18.204 --> 33:19.789
Could you come with me for a second?

33:19.872 --> 33:22.792
I.A.D. wants to talk to you
about the Garfield shooting.

33:26.796 --> 33:27.922
(telephone rings)

33:28.006 --> 33:29.173
Hill Street, Goldblume.

33:30.341 --> 33:31.676
Hi, Robin. How are you?

33:32.969 --> 33:34.887
No, you missed him.
He just went out on a bust.

33:36.264 --> 33:37.890
Oh. Well, uh...

33:38.433 --> 33:39.809
maybe he didn't go out on a bust.

33:39.892 --> 33:41.436
Maybe, uh...

33:41.519 --> 33:43.855
Look, I'll tell him you called, okay?

33:45.023 --> 33:46.024
Right.

33:47.316 --> 33:48.151
Whoops.

33:49.318 --> 33:52.613
We've heard testimony that you proceeded
to the site of a reported shooting

33:52.697 --> 33:55.950
without waiting for your partner.
You're aware that's improper procedure.

33:56.451 --> 33:57.285
Yes, sir.

33:57.368 --> 33:59.245
In fact, you arrived
at the mouth of the alley

33:59.328 --> 34:02.123
a good 15 or 20 seconds
before Officer Trapido, didn't you?

34:02.957 --> 34:03.791
Yes, Captain.

34:03.875 --> 34:06.669
This fact was either omitted or misstated

34:06.753 --> 34:08.838
in your form 319 report, correct?

34:09.839 --> 34:11.716
Now, I must inform you
that your statements,

34:11.799 --> 34:13.342
both written and oral,
can be used in evidence

34:13.426 --> 34:16.345
in any future Internal Affairs review
of your conduct in this matter.

34:16.429 --> 34:18.556
Which, I would add,
is not our intention now.

34:20.725 --> 34:22.852
We just want you to tell us
what you saw in that alley

34:22.935 --> 34:24.395
before Officer Trapido got there.

34:24.479 --> 34:26.272
Was this omitted from your 319 report

34:26.355 --> 34:29.067
in order to cover the fact
that you got there before your partner?

34:29.817 --> 34:31.778
I didn't go down the alley
till Jim went with me.

34:31.861 --> 34:33.905
We understand. You didn't go in.

34:34.697 --> 34:35.823
But did you look down it?

34:36.657 --> 34:37.658
Yes.

34:37.742 --> 34:38.868
What did you see?

34:40.119 --> 34:41.788
If I thought it was anything,
I would've written it.

34:41.871 --> 34:43.831
Officer Wiley, we're not out to get you.

34:44.499 --> 34:47.126
You just tell us what you saw,
and we'll judge its importance.

34:50.171 --> 34:51.297
Okay.

34:51.380 --> 34:53.216
MAN: Lieutenant? Over here, sir.

34:55.635 --> 34:57.512
Somebody went down right here, Lieutenant.

34:57.595 --> 35:00.181
Here, take this coat to the lab,
have it typed ASAP.

35:00.264 --> 35:01.599
Least we know it ain't Belker.

35:01.682 --> 35:05.061
Not unless he bought that coat last night.
He was wearing a black cashmere.

35:05.144 --> 35:06.687
Lieutenant? Company coming.

35:06.771 --> 35:09.607
MAN: Let's make a list of this stuff
before we take it down to the lab.

35:15.696 --> 35:16.656
It's Suarez.

35:21.911 --> 35:23.079
Hold it!

35:23.162 --> 35:25.039
(action music playing)

35:29.502 --> 35:32.421
(sirens wail)

35:33.214 --> 35:36.008
Intercept suspect, Gold Lincoln,
heading towards rear gate.

35:47.019 --> 35:48.896
(sirens shut off)

35:48.980 --> 35:50.356
Freeze!

35:50.439 --> 35:51.649
Come on, back around the car.

35:51.732 --> 35:53.609
Come on! Don't make me come to you.

35:53.693 --> 35:55.903
Come on! Well, look what we got here, huh?

35:56.737 --> 35:58.656
Hey, man, I was just
on the way to the bank.

35:58.739 --> 36:01.659
Gee, you missed it, Suarez.
It's already after 3:00.

36:02.076 --> 36:04.871
-My, my, my! Did you win the lottery? Huh?
-That's my money!

36:04.954 --> 36:08.291
Really? You hear that?
He says all this money is his. Hmph!

36:08.374 --> 36:11.335
The I.R.S. will be glad to know
how good your newsstands are doing.

36:11.419 --> 36:12.545
Put your hands behind your back.

36:12.628 --> 36:14.255
What's the beef, man?
I ain't done nothing.

36:14.338 --> 36:16.841
Speed limit in here is
ten miles per hour, palsie.

36:16.924 --> 36:18.759
You were doing 50. Come on.

36:18.843 --> 36:21.137
I'll call in an APB for Belker.

36:21.846 --> 36:26.350
Aha! A great big "pbblt" to you, Wally.

36:26.434 --> 36:27.351
I know.

36:27.435 --> 36:28.436
Strike's over, bud.

36:28.519 --> 36:30.104
I know. Don't rub it in.

36:30.188 --> 36:33.983
Last deposit, Wally, 830 pounds?

36:34.066 --> 36:35.193
(scale vibrates)

36:35.276 --> 36:38.362
5 foot four and a half. Where to, bud?

36:38.446 --> 36:39.906
5-B.

36:39.989 --> 36:43.451
Hard to believe anybody would want to work
in a place like this, isn't it, fellas?

36:43.534 --> 36:46.662
Private mortuaries are dead.
There's no action.

36:48.664 --> 36:51.918
Well, Wally, if you would
have kept a tighter ship,

36:52.001 --> 36:53.461
maybe you could have kept your job.

36:53.544 --> 36:55.963
Aw, hell, I was perfect for this place.

36:56.047 --> 36:59.008
This is the kind of place where you come
when you don't need any records.

36:59.091 --> 37:00.801
This is the place where you wind up

37:00.885 --> 37:02.553
when you die an "X."

37:04.263 --> 37:05.681
Oh, no!

37:05.765 --> 37:06.933
No.

37:08.100 --> 37:09.310
No.

37:12.230 --> 37:13.522
What's the matter, son?

37:14.357 --> 37:15.274
He know the man?

37:15.816 --> 37:17.360
It's his daddy.

37:17.443 --> 37:18.694
Oh.

37:20.780 --> 37:23.407
Ah, I'll wait outside.

37:24.951 --> 37:26.661
Sorry for your loss.

37:27.578 --> 37:28.537
Oh...

37:30.498 --> 37:31.874
Nydorf Brothers card.

37:36.921 --> 37:38.839
WILEY: <i>We had our two prisoners to secure,</i>

37:38.923 --> 37:40.633
<i>which delayed Officer Trapido.</i>

37:40.716 --> 37:43.094
<i>I reached the other end of</i>
<i>the alley pretty adrenalated.</i>

37:43.177 --> 37:45.388
I had my weapon out.
But then I was relieved,

37:45.471 --> 37:48.266
because I could see there was a cop there
and he was all right.

37:48.349 --> 37:51.477
-The cop was Officer Steger?
-That's correct.

37:51.560 --> 37:53.062
Then he bent over the body.

37:53.145 --> 37:54.730
I was blocked for a few seconds,

37:54.814 --> 37:56.399
but then he turned, so I could see

37:56.482 --> 37:58.526
<i>that he'd found a pistol</i>
<i>in the perp's hand</i>

37:58.609 --> 37:59.652
<i>and was removing it.</i>

37:59.735 --> 38:01.821
FRANK:
<i>Try not to draw conclusions, Officer.</i>

38:02.446 --> 38:03.614
Right. Okay.

38:03.698 --> 38:04.740
I saw him take...

38:05.783 --> 38:08.369
he took the pistol out of the perp's hand

38:08.452 --> 38:09.495
and stood up.

38:09.578 --> 38:11.998
Then my partner came,
yelling, "What's going on?"

38:12.081 --> 38:13.833
And the next time I looked down the alley,

38:13.916 --> 38:15.543
<i>Steger was holding up the piece</i>

38:15.626 --> 38:18.337
<i>for Garfield and the other cops</i>
<i>who were just coming in.</i>

38:19.130 --> 38:20.965
Captain, I'm sure this last part

38:21.048 --> 38:23.551
Jimmy and I had on our statement
because he was there by then.

38:23.634 --> 38:27.513
Are you absolutely certain
that Officer Steger

38:27.596 --> 38:29.807
was removing a weapon
from the victim's hand?

38:30.933 --> 38:31.767
Yes, sir.

38:32.518 --> 38:34.979
Officer Steger claims he found the weapon

38:35.062 --> 38:37.273
approximately 4 feet from the body.

38:39.066 --> 38:40.776
That's not true.

38:43.904 --> 38:46.490
(telephone ringing)

38:46.574 --> 38:48.367
(indistinct conversation)

38:50.828 --> 38:53.873
Busy. I can't believe it.
I've always been able to reach her.

38:55.166 --> 38:56.709
-Stan.
-What?

38:57.668 --> 39:00.129
Stan, I got a feeling something
terrible's gonna happen.

39:01.297 --> 39:02.715
I gotta talk to Cynthia.

39:03.215 --> 39:05.343
(breathing heavily)

39:05.426 --> 39:06.761
You sure you're okay?

39:07.470 --> 39:09.764
(gulps)

39:10.264 --> 39:11.640
Still busy.

39:11.724 --> 39:14.268
My wife, the realtor,
she's probably selling a house.

39:14.352 --> 39:15.519
JIM: Officer Steger...

39:18.022 --> 39:21.233
I'm arresting you for preparing
false evidence and subornation of perjury.

39:22.610 --> 39:24.236
You have the right to remain silent.

39:24.320 --> 39:25.738
You have the right to an attorney.

39:25.821 --> 39:27.823
Anything you say can
and will be used against you

39:27.907 --> 39:29.283
in a court of law.

39:31.160 --> 39:34.705
(indistinct chattering)

39:38.626 --> 39:40.586
Hey, Robin? J.D. Larue.

39:40.669 --> 39:43.923
Uh, look...
Mick's still out on the operation.

39:44.757 --> 39:47.009
Yeah, I guess it did foul up again.

39:47.510 --> 39:48.427
No, no...

39:48.511 --> 39:50.096
Lieutenant, we got an all-points out

39:50.179 --> 39:51.847
on the vehicle they got Belker in.

39:51.931 --> 39:53.265
Let's divert units.

39:53.349 --> 39:55.851
-Link them to the heights and Polk.
-Yeah.

39:55.935 --> 39:57.728
Uh, Bates? Coffey?

39:58.896 --> 40:01.982
Uh, Renko, you and Hill want to go on
overtime to track down Belker?

40:02.066 --> 40:03.609
Well, Bobby's father's dead.

40:03.692 --> 40:05.736
-What?
-Bobby Hill's father's dead.

40:05.820 --> 40:08.697
We found him lyin' on a slab
in the city morgue.

40:09.240 --> 40:11.242
And I thought I was having problems.

40:14.036 --> 40:16.163
The foreman's pretty sure
that Mick's okay.

40:16.247 --> 40:18.624
They treat the chemists like royalty.

40:25.464 --> 40:27.758
So your minds are made up?
You think I planted the gun?

40:27.842 --> 40:31.345
Officer, we're basing our conclusion
on an eyewitness account.

40:32.513 --> 40:35.641
What she saw tells you what I did.
It doesn't tell you why.

40:35.724 --> 40:37.226
That kid asked me to help him!

40:37.309 --> 40:40.312
Are you saying that Officer Garfield
asked you to plant a weapon?

40:40.396 --> 40:42.565
Asked me? He <i>begged </i>me to do it for him!

40:42.648 --> 40:43.524
FRANK: Why?

40:43.607 --> 40:45.818
He was afraid of going down
on a bad shoot. That's why.

40:45.901 --> 40:46.902
That's not my question.

40:46.986 --> 40:49.113
Why would a man who had met you
only two hours before

40:49.196 --> 40:50.698
assume you would commit
a felony to save him?

40:50.781 --> 40:53.325
You're asking me to think
for the kid again. How do I know?

40:53.409 --> 40:56.328
It's the way I am or something.
People are always asking me for favors.

40:56.412 --> 40:59.540
We're talking about a lot more
than a favor here. Complicity is a crime.

40:59.623 --> 41:01.083
He was desperate!

41:01.917 --> 41:04.753
For crying out loud,
he didn't have no one else!

41:04.837 --> 41:06.130
Don't you see what I'm saying?

41:07.047 --> 41:09.425
I'm the kind of guy
who would have helped him. Ask anyone.

41:09.508 --> 41:12.636
Jack, is it possible
you planted the piece?

41:12.720 --> 41:15.264
-No.
-Just trying to help the kid out?

41:15.347 --> 41:16.182
No!

41:19.310 --> 41:20.895
Oh, this is beautiful.

41:24.190 --> 41:25.983
This is par for the course, all right.

41:27.109 --> 41:28.903
Hey, look...

41:28.986 --> 41:30.863
JIM:
Officer, will you come with me, please?

41:39.663 --> 41:41.499
I can't believe I'm going down on this.

41:47.421 --> 41:50.132
Robin Tataglia's on line 3, Frank.
She'd like to talk to you.

41:50.216 --> 41:51.717
-How is she?
-Holding up.

41:55.179 --> 41:56.555
Yeah, Robin?

41:57.806 --> 42:00.100
Well, we have two sightings
of them on the interstate,

42:00.184 --> 42:01.977
and we have their license number.

42:03.312 --> 42:05.147
Uh, Robin, I'm sure he's all right.

42:05.231 --> 42:06.982
The last thing they want
to do is hurt him.

42:08.484 --> 42:10.027
Well, y--

42:10.110 --> 42:12.112
yes, there was some blood
found at the scene,

42:12.196 --> 42:13.739
but it wasn't Mick's type.

42:14.281 --> 42:16.116
I know how hard this must be for you,

42:16.200 --> 42:18.744
but I don't think
it's going to be long now.

42:20.204 --> 42:21.914
No hard feelings, huh, Mick?

42:22.581 --> 42:23.666
Right.

42:23.749 --> 42:25.000
He'll be okay.

42:25.793 --> 42:29.004
We're all gonna be okay
once we cross that state line.

42:29.088 --> 42:30.256
Yeah.

42:30.339 --> 42:33.217
We're gonna be big
once we get to Nevada, man.

42:33.300 --> 42:36.720
We're gonna have a big syndicate
and hundreds of dudes working for us.

42:37.179 --> 42:39.765
Because we got the brainpower,
you and me, Philip.

42:39.848 --> 42:42.184
The ace chemist in
the whole free world, man.

42:42.268 --> 42:44.353
(chuckles)

42:44.436 --> 42:46.480
Forget about her, Mick.

42:46.564 --> 42:48.983
We are going to make a star
out of you in Nevada!

42:49.066 --> 42:51.443
-But, fellas, you don't understand.
-What?

42:51.527 --> 42:52.945
I'm getting married.

42:53.028 --> 42:56.240
In Nevada you can get married
as much as you want, Mick.

42:57.992 --> 42:59.326
Hey, Philip...

42:59.910 --> 43:01.704
Over there, that looks like a good one.

43:07.585 --> 43:08.752
Come on!

43:18.596 --> 43:19.847
Put this on.

43:26.312 --> 43:27.313
Here.

43:28.939 --> 43:31.483
It's only a toy.
You're just gonna scare them.

43:37.197 --> 43:38.490
Everybody down!

43:38.574 --> 43:39.867
On the floor!

43:39.950 --> 43:41.327
One move, and I'll kill you!

43:41.410 --> 43:42.244
Open it!

43:42.328 --> 43:43.829
Anything, okay? Just don't hurt me.

43:43.912 --> 43:45.331
All right. Get down!

43:45.831 --> 43:47.333
If anyone moves, I'll kill them!

43:47.416 --> 43:50.628
It's taking too long! Let's get going!
Chato!

43:51.086 --> 43:52.921
-(shot)
-(screaming)

43:54.214 --> 43:56.550
-(shot)
-(moans)

43:56.634 --> 43:57.593
That's enough!

43:57.676 --> 43:59.678
I'll blow your frigging head off!

43:59.762 --> 44:01.513
Don't shoot! I'm a police officer!

44:01.597 --> 44:03.515
You're a what? The hell you are!

44:03.599 --> 44:04.892
Honest to God!

44:06.644 --> 44:08.062
I got a badge in my back pocket.

44:08.145 --> 44:10.356
(panting) Don't shoot. Lower the gun.

44:10.439 --> 44:12.691
I'm just going slow
into my back pocket for this badge.

44:12.775 --> 44:14.151
(breathing heavily)

44:15.194 --> 44:16.362
Here, here.

44:17.905 --> 44:20.407
Glad I didn't buy anything that spoils.
Otherwise,

44:20.491 --> 44:23.994
they'd have ended up getting married.
If they ever do, we'll get flowers.

44:24.745 --> 44:26.038
Neal.

44:26.121 --> 44:27.706
-Hey, Ronnie, my man!
-Hey, Ron.

44:27.790 --> 44:31.001
Hey, I heard the good news. I'm glad.
(chuckles)

44:31.752 --> 44:33.879
I just want to say thanks
for keeping me cool today.

44:33.962 --> 44:35.964
-Hey, no problem.
-How do you figure Steger?

44:36.965 --> 44:38.008
I don't.

44:38.467 --> 44:39.927
The guy almost ruined my life.

44:40.469 --> 44:41.970
I'm glad it worked out, Ron.

44:42.054 --> 44:43.514
Hey, welcome aboard, kid.

44:44.765 --> 44:45.808
Thanks.

44:46.642 --> 44:47.559
(laughs)

44:48.769 --> 44:52.147
I expected, you know,
a few tears, a little upset...

44:53.399 --> 44:55.734
But she was totally devastated.

44:55.818 --> 44:57.903
It was like they were newlyweds.

44:58.946 --> 45:00.989
Maybe that's the way
she wants to remember it.

45:01.073 --> 45:02.074
Hmph.

45:02.825 --> 45:03.951
He'd cat around,

45:04.493 --> 45:06.870
disappear for years at a time,

45:06.954 --> 45:09.289
and she'd still pray to Jesus

45:09.373 --> 45:12.126
that he would one day see the light.

45:12.668 --> 45:15.087
Your mama's a good Christian
woman, God love her.

45:15.754 --> 45:17.047
Yes, she is.

45:18.215 --> 45:19.299
Hey...

45:20.676 --> 45:22.344
but that's not what he needed.

45:23.846 --> 45:26.306
He needed someone to kick his butt,

45:26.390 --> 45:29.309
someone to say, "You got a family.

45:29.393 --> 45:31.145
You got responsibilities.

45:31.228 --> 45:33.564
Why don't you act like a man?"

45:39.153 --> 45:41.572
You got any idea what
he was doing around here?

45:44.032 --> 45:44.908
I don't know.

45:47.202 --> 45:48.287
Working on the angle?

45:48.370 --> 45:51.582
(chuckling)

45:53.751 --> 45:55.794
The worst part of it is, Renko,

45:55.878 --> 45:57.379
in spite of it all...

46:00.299 --> 46:01.341
I loved him.

46:05.053 --> 46:06.180
Hey, toast.

46:06.722 --> 46:08.056
Reggie Hill...

46:08.849 --> 46:12.895
A man who lived solely
for his own pleasures.

46:12.978 --> 46:16.023
A man who didn't give a damn about anyone.

46:16.106 --> 46:20.110
I ain't gonna drink to that.
I don't think you want to, either.

46:21.487 --> 46:23.280
Even if he was here for me...

46:24.364 --> 46:25.908
if he was here, so what?

46:27.785 --> 46:29.745
We never worked it out between us.

46:29.828 --> 46:31.747
(sobs)

46:39.254 --> 46:40.798
Listen to me, pal. I think...

46:42.257 --> 46:45.636
I think maybe this time you ought
to let yourself think it might have.

46:45.719 --> 46:48.555
(sobs)

46:48.639 --> 46:51.809
Alright, come on. Knock this off.
We got to pour you on a train, my brother.

47:13.956 --> 47:15.165
(sighs)

47:17.042 --> 47:18.335
(knock on door)

47:20.504 --> 47:21.672
Who is it?

47:27.678 --> 47:28.887
Who is it?

47:28.971 --> 47:30.055
FABIAN: It's me.

47:35.185 --> 47:36.812
Fabian, what are you doing here?

47:36.895 --> 47:38.856
You sounded lonely, Lucy.

47:39.439 --> 47:40.649
(laughs)

47:42.025 --> 47:43.402
Oh!

47:43.485 --> 47:44.570
Oh!

47:45.696 --> 47:46.780
(sighs)

47:46.864 --> 47:49.074
(both laughing)

47:49.157 --> 47:51.493
(emotional music playing)

48:01.670 --> 48:03.672
(theme music playing)
