00:00.547 --> 00:01.882
Previously on Underground...

00:01.948 --> 00:03.418
I get it now.

00:03.484 --> 00:05.819
It's about not letting the white
folks define your story.

00:05.886 --> 00:07.176
Run with me.

00:07.243 --> 00:08.790
I own you!

00:12.759 --> 00:14.294
It's all right. I got you.

00:14.361 --> 00:15.729
We must be vigilant.

00:15.796 --> 00:18.465
Never compromising our heritage.

00:23.070 --> 00:24.305
A friend of a friend sent us.

00:24.372 --> 00:25.440
Rosalee.

00:31.212 --> 00:35.549
Lord, make me an instrument of peace.

00:37.250 --> 00:40.521
Where there is hatred, let me sow love.

00:43.223 --> 00:45.659
Where there is injury...

00:46.360 --> 00:47.628
...pardon.

00:49.363 --> 00:51.700
Where there is doubt...

00:53.266 --> 00:54.435
...faith.

00:55.536 --> 00:58.239
Where there is despair, hope.

01:00.374 --> 01:03.277
Where there is darkness, light.

01:05.446 --> 01:08.917
Where there is sadness, joy.

01:12.020 --> 01:14.722
O, Divine Master,

01:14.788 --> 01:18.725
grant that I may not so much
seek to be consoled

01:18.791 --> 01:20.294
as to console.

01:24.931 --> 01:28.001
To be understood as to understand.

01:31.904 --> 01:34.108
To be loved as to love.

01:37.244 --> 01:39.246
For it is in giving that we receive.

01:42.649 --> 01:45.053
It is in pardoning that we are pardoned.

01:48.189 --> 01:52.860
It is in dying that we are
born again to eternal life.

02:00.100 --> 02:01.335
Amen.

03:03.097 --> 03:04.098
He's back.

03:05.599 --> 03:07.634
Are you okay? What took you so long?

03:07.701 --> 03:08.869
News has spread that the last of

03:08.936 --> 03:10.403
the Macon seven have crossed the river.

03:10.470 --> 03:12.640
The marshals have men on
every road going out of town,

03:12.706 --> 03:15.875
and the slave catchers are flooding the
area, looking for the high reward.

03:15.943 --> 03:18.100
- It's a free-for-all out there.
- Well, then we'll

03:18.166 --> 03:19.379
keep them here until someone
can come from Ripley.

03:19.446 --> 03:21.047
We can't keep them in the hideaway.

03:21.115 --> 03:23.016
And we don't have time to wait it out.

03:23.082 --> 03:24.784
The marshals know that
someone's aiding the runaways.

03:24.851 --> 03:25.853
They're going door to door.

03:25.920 --> 03:28.556
We got... a day, at most.

03:28.622 --> 03:30.591
- Where's Ripley?
- It's just over the county line.

03:30.658 --> 03:32.360
It's a heavy abolitionist community.

03:32.426 --> 03:34.628
We can't fit in your wagon,
you could take Boo.

03:34.694 --> 03:36.196
We can't risk it with
the slave catcher presence.

03:36.264 --> 03:38.700
Their greed is making them bold.

03:38.766 --> 03:40.568
We gotta flood the streets with money.

03:43.303 --> 03:45.640
Scatter their focus, give us
a chance to slip past them.

03:47.040 --> 03:48.241
Rumor is that the jail cells

03:48.308 --> 03:50.877
at the marshals' office
are at full capacity.

03:50.944 --> 03:52.480
Then that's where we need to go.

03:54.515 --> 03:56.017
We have another problem.

04:16.336 --> 04:18.473
I wanted to be
a better man than my father.

04:20.540 --> 04:21.975
He always had his eye
on political office,

04:22.041 --> 04:23.977
but he couldn't get his head
out of a bottle long enough

04:24.043 --> 04:25.379
to finish a campaign.

04:28.682 --> 04:30.250
I guess I can hold
my liquor better than him.

04:34.254 --> 04:35.956
Senator Tom Macon.

04:38.158 --> 04:39.760
That's not even my name.

04:40.862 --> 04:42.664
Coward Tom Hawkes.

04:44.031 --> 04:45.300
Sounds right.

04:49.069 --> 04:50.470
Sam's dead because of me.

04:52.639 --> 04:54.541
I can't... I can't even
look myself in the mirror.

04:54.608 --> 04:55.942
I can't sleep. I can't eat.

04:56.009 --> 04:58.178
I just feel nothing.

05:02.048 --> 05:03.283
Please.

05:05.485 --> 05:06.521
Please...

05:09.656 --> 05:11.257
Please forgive me.

05:11.324 --> 05:12.526
Please.

05:14.761 --> 05:16.297
It's my fault.

05:19.432 --> 05:22.002
God is punishing me for my sins.

05:24.471 --> 05:26.445
For what I done to Pearly Mae.

05:29.143 --> 05:30.410
What did you do?

05:33.747 --> 05:35.717
She was gonna give up Rosalee.

05:44.824 --> 05:47.827
There's nothing else you could do.
You did what you had to do.

05:47.894 --> 05:51.798
And I pray for my salvation every day.

05:57.304 --> 05:59.198
There's only pain now.

05:59.265 --> 06:00.408
It doesn't have to be.

06:03.478 --> 06:05.713
I can make you feel something else.

06:11.951 --> 06:13.886
Look at me.

06:13.954 --> 06:16.023
I know we can be happy again, together.

06:16.090 --> 06:19.594
I want you to come
to Washington with me.

06:19.660 --> 06:20.994
We can start over there.

06:25.365 --> 06:27.567
Leave all this pain behind.

06:31.437 --> 06:33.005
We can be free.

07:06.807 --> 07:08.443
Well, if I was you, I...

07:09.543 --> 07:12.312
I don't, I don't know if I could do it.

07:12.379 --> 07:15.148
Open up my home to, to runaways.

07:16.182 --> 07:18.920
You ran 600 miles.

07:18.985 --> 07:21.021
I imagine you can do anything.

07:21.088 --> 07:23.290
I ran 'cause I ain't had nothing else.

07:23.357 --> 07:25.759
Nothing to live for except, maybe,

07:25.826 --> 07:27.702
the idea of being free.

07:29.064 --> 07:30.564
And if I get it,

07:30.901 --> 07:32.399
I ain't gonna do nothing to lose it.

07:36.255 --> 07:38.107
I didn't want to do this.

07:38.907 --> 07:40.006
Not at first.

07:42.168 --> 07:44.769
I fought John when he
suggested using our home.

07:44.836 --> 07:48.642
I thought it was
too dangerous, too risky.

07:50.375 --> 07:51.644
And now?

07:53.846 --> 07:55.749
I still think it's too dangerous.

07:57.716 --> 08:00.051
The only way that this is going to end

08:00.118 --> 08:01.787
is with us being caught...

08:02.656 --> 08:03.857
...or dead.

08:05.824 --> 08:07.763
Had I really understood that,

08:08.259 --> 08:11.531
what this choice would cost us,

08:13.399 --> 08:15.869
I'm... I'm not sure that
I would make the same one.

08:19.305 --> 08:20.692
Yes, you would.

08:21.574 --> 08:23.543
I've seen the way you look at Boo.

08:29.716 --> 08:30.800
Maybe...

08:32.551 --> 08:35.087
...if we can just get her to freedom,

08:36.456 --> 08:40.860
whatever happened and will happen...

08:43.263 --> 08:44.958
It'll all have been worth it.

09:00.013 --> 09:02.882
How you and your brother
end up so different...

09:02.947 --> 09:05.518
One owning slaves,
the other one helping them.

09:05.583 --> 09:07.453
Honestly, I have no idea.

09:08.888 --> 09:10.456
Tom was always an opportunist,

09:10.523 --> 09:12.459
ambitious even when we were kids.

09:14.726 --> 09:16.127
But I always
thought he had a good heart,

09:16.195 --> 09:18.927
that he was just misguided.

09:19.498 --> 09:21.033
I'm not so sure anymore.

09:21.100 --> 09:23.202
People surprise you,
the things they're capable of.

09:25.138 --> 09:26.806
You have any brothers or sisters?

09:26.873 --> 09:29.642
Two brothers. James and Sam.

09:29.708 --> 09:31.577
Sam, the carpenter from the plantation?

09:31.644 --> 09:33.379
Uh-huh, he was supposed
to leave Macon with us,

09:33.446 --> 09:34.848
but he never got off the plantation.

09:36.149 --> 09:37.250
Why not?

09:39.485 --> 09:41.008
I think he was scared.

09:41.654 --> 09:45.124
And he thought massa, your brother,

09:45.191 --> 09:47.459
was gonna let him buy his freedom.

09:47.525 --> 09:48.593
I hope he will.

09:48.660 --> 09:49.575
Rosalee.

09:50.629 --> 09:51.520
What?

10:16.489 --> 10:18.191
I'm just...

10:18.258 --> 10:20.694
I'm just going to leave
these over here for you.

10:28.567 --> 10:29.702
Don't go.

12:42.100 --> 12:44.661
I wish I was back on that plantation.

12:46.072 --> 12:47.640
For James and Momma.

12:49.509 --> 12:52.712
I can only imagine the state she in.

12:57.216 --> 12:58.719
We done lost everyone.

12:58.784 --> 13:00.486
And the things we done to get here...

13:02.755 --> 13:05.124
Why we deserve to be
free and not the others?

13:06.894 --> 13:08.327
Every single one of 'em I picked

13:08.394 --> 13:10.494
'cause I knew they could
help me get to freedom.

13:11.431 --> 13:14.067
Cato said I was just using them.

13:15.201 --> 13:16.836
And I proved him right.

13:19.706 --> 13:21.039
Ain't neither one of us

13:21.106 --> 13:23.165
come out clean on the
other side of that river.

13:23.543 --> 13:25.550
That's 'cause we just trying to survive.

13:26.812 --> 13:29.515
Freedom, it got to mean more than that.

13:29.582 --> 13:31.101
It got to be more than that.

13:31.484 --> 13:33.153
Ain't about if we deserve it.

13:33.220 --> 13:34.221
It's ours.

13:34.520 --> 13:36.613
They keep killing us
so we can forget that.

13:37.124 --> 13:39.741
And we can't let what
they do turn us into them.

13:40.259 --> 13:41.961
All we been thinking
about is getting north,

13:42.028 --> 13:45.098
and... and we done fought
so hard to get here, so hard.

13:45.164 --> 13:46.599
But it ain't enough.

13:51.904 --> 13:54.082
Ain't none of us free till we all free.

14:08.322 --> 14:09.973
So that's another two, then.

14:10.590 --> 14:13.027
They at least get the money
they went chasing after?

14:15.028 --> 14:16.763
Patty's going to have my head.

14:21.467 --> 14:23.269
- How's your son?
- Going to need surgery.

14:23.336 --> 14:24.471
I got to find the money.

14:24.538 --> 14:25.564
Sorry to hear that.

14:26.340 --> 14:28.575
I'll make sure I get one for
him when we catch that girl.

14:30.043 --> 14:32.278
12-year-old boy and she just stabs him.

14:32.345 --> 14:33.580
Think I'm gonna let that pass?

14:36.548 --> 14:38.619
You plan on killing
that girl all of a sudden?

14:41.520 --> 14:43.121
No. I plan on killing her slow.

14:43.188 --> 14:45.124
That ain't gonna happen.

14:45.192 --> 14:46.625
Patty's all about her numbers,

14:46.692 --> 14:48.995
and we took a big hit here today.

14:49.062 --> 14:51.298
The only way to recoup
that balance sheet

14:51.364 --> 14:54.435
is to catch Rosalee alive
and get her reward.

14:57.937 --> 14:59.139
We had a deal.

15:00.306 --> 15:01.442
We did.

15:03.408 --> 15:05.717
But given we are at cross-purposes now,

15:06.078 --> 15:08.381
seems like the proper time
to renegotiate.

15:51.857 --> 15:53.192
Well, they told me themselves.

15:53.259 --> 15:54.495
They the Macon seven.

15:55.061 --> 15:56.429
Move along.

15:58.798 --> 15:59.966
Ma'am, may I help you?

16:00.033 --> 16:02.000
Yes, I'm looking for Marshal Risdin.

16:02.067 --> 16:03.569
You and me both.

16:03.637 --> 16:05.572
And his boss for that matter.

16:05.639 --> 16:08.575
We haven't seen him in days,
but what can I do for you?

16:08.642 --> 16:10.276
I have some information for him.

16:10.342 --> 16:11.944
On possible runaway activity.

16:12.012 --> 16:14.481
I suppose you can pass
that along through me.

16:14.547 --> 16:17.183
No, I would rather deliver it
right to the marshal.

16:17.250 --> 16:19.986
Perhaps I could leave
a note on his desk?

16:20.052 --> 16:21.653
Yeah, I don't think that's gonna be...

16:21.721 --> 16:23.756
Drop your weapons or I drop this white woman!

16:35.567 --> 16:37.370
John Hawkes?

16:37.437 --> 16:39.072
John Hawkes? Are you John Hawkes?

16:39.138 --> 16:40.273
Yes.

16:42.107 --> 16:44.376
My name is August Pullman.

16:44.443 --> 16:46.712
Your brother hired me to track
down his runaway slaves.

16:50.015 --> 16:52.618
I'm... I'm, I'm sorry
to show up unannounced,

16:52.686 --> 16:54.288
but he said if I was in the area

16:54.354 --> 16:56.928
and I was in need, I should come to you.

16:57.624 --> 17:01.226
My boy, he's been injured.
He needs surgery right away.

17:01.293 --> 17:03.329
I'm sorry to hear that. How can I help?

17:03.396 --> 17:06.531
If you could send a wire to your brother
I need the money owed me straight away.

17:09.501 --> 17:11.404
- Of course, of course.
- Thank you.

17:20.480 --> 17:23.217
If you'll wait here, I'll draft
that promissory note for you.

17:27.487 --> 17:28.721
Gimme that gun.

17:28.788 --> 17:30.691
Put the rest on the desk over there.

17:35.361 --> 17:36.996
What do you want?

17:37.063 --> 17:39.733
Well, I want all sorts of things.

17:39.798 --> 17:42.001
I want to live in a world where

17:42.068 --> 17:43.702
I ain't got to run
through a hundred miles

17:43.769 --> 17:45.771
of shadow just to have a last name.

17:47.306 --> 17:50.376
I want to work a day
and get a fair day's wage.

17:50.442 --> 17:53.012
And when I'm done I want
a place to rest my head.

17:55.048 --> 17:57.384
Have something I can call my own.

17:58.351 --> 18:00.754
I want to be counted!

18:00.819 --> 18:03.089
It's our hands that built this country!

18:03.155 --> 18:05.357
It's our blood that's running
through the heart of it.

18:05.423 --> 18:07.002
We keep it beating!

18:08.060 --> 18:11.129
Seem to me that make more
American than any of you.

18:11.698 --> 18:13.367
I can't give you any of that.

18:13.432 --> 18:15.102
No, I suppose you can't.

18:18.070 --> 18:19.839
But you know what you can do?

18:23.210 --> 18:24.611
You can let everyone out of here.

18:35.288 --> 18:37.557
Now, who got the key to the cell?

19:01.325 --> 19:03.062
Stop it.

19:06.364 --> 19:07.566
Stop it.

19:20.747 --> 19:22.480
All right, now, once night falls,

19:22.547 --> 19:24.115
you look for that big
sippin' spoon in the sky.

19:24.182 --> 19:25.583
Okay, that's a drinkin' gourd.

19:25.651 --> 19:28.053
All right, you follow it as far
north as your feet'll take you.

19:28.120 --> 19:30.723
If you run into any trouble,
use the gun.

19:30.789 --> 19:32.825
They ain't gonna have no
problem using theirs on you.

19:38.029 --> 19:40.665
Now, if you get caught,
do two things straightaway.

19:40.733 --> 19:43.402
You ask for a lawyer and you
gonna ask for this one man.

19:43.468 --> 19:45.071
He'll help you.

19:48.975 --> 19:50.443
You have a draft.

19:52.178 --> 19:54.747
Yes, well, it's an old house.

19:55.980 --> 19:57.983
Well, not this room.
It's been remodeled.

20:01.120 --> 20:02.354
Them floorboards is new.

20:04.023 --> 20:05.302
You have a good eye.

20:06.092 --> 20:09.262
We redid everything in anticipation
of our baby's arrival.

20:15.366 --> 20:18.637
I'm sure you're eager
to get this to the bank.

20:18.704 --> 20:20.340
So you can get back to your son.

20:26.778 --> 20:28.441
Your brother's runaways,

20:29.215 --> 20:30.884
did you know one of them's kin to you?

20:34.352 --> 20:36.355
The girl. Rosalee's her name.

20:38.891 --> 20:40.259
She's his daughter.

20:46.699 --> 20:48.868
She's also the one that hurt my boy.

20:51.903 --> 20:53.805
John?

20:53.872 --> 20:55.740
- Liz...
- It worked.

20:55.807 --> 20:57.309
This is August Pullman.

20:57.375 --> 21:00.112
Tom hired him to track
the runaway slaves

21:00.179 --> 21:01.270
from his plantation.

21:01.947 --> 21:03.389
What are you doing here?

21:03.849 --> 21:05.318
One of them was just
at the marshals' office.

21:05.383 --> 21:07.620
He forced them to free
all the captured slaves.

21:11.923 --> 21:13.325
Thank you for this.

21:27.139 --> 21:29.108
- Move it, boy!
- Please, no!

21:31.310 --> 21:33.012
Go on, get!

21:33.079 --> 21:34.847
Move it, I said!

21:34.913 --> 21:36.782
Please don't make me go back!

21:40.352 --> 21:41.888
Where Noah?

21:41.954 --> 21:44.056
He got away with the others.
He should be back soon.

21:44.122 --> 21:45.790
Then we'll ride for Ripley.

21:45.858 --> 21:47.660
Suit yourself then.

21:51.162 --> 21:52.265
Run!

21:54.967 --> 21:56.369
Pullman knew something was up.

21:56.436 --> 21:58.070
We can't wait for Noah.
We have to leave.

22:04.243 --> 22:05.778
I wouldn't if I were you.

22:10.516 --> 22:11.617
Come on!

22:17.689 --> 22:18.991
Rosalee, run!

23:25.190 --> 23:27.293
I think you'd make
some beautiful furniture.

23:28.060 --> 23:29.428
All right, James.

23:29.495 --> 23:31.964
You need to keep a steady hand
and you need to be patient.

23:32.031 --> 23:35.000
There ain't anything done right
that was done with haste.

23:35.066 --> 23:36.501
All right, easy now.

23:36.567 --> 23:38.003
I got it.

23:38.070 --> 23:39.972
I know you do.
You handle that real well.

23:42.874 --> 23:44.209
Sam was teaching me.

23:44.276 --> 23:46.211
Do you think he'll
come back to visit soon?

23:48.046 --> 23:50.749
Well, where do you think Sam is?

23:50.815 --> 23:52.250
Momma says he went to the city

23:52.317 --> 23:54.420
to make furniture
for the rich white folks.

23:56.455 --> 23:57.656
Well, you know, most likely

23:57.722 --> 24:00.273
Sam is probably really busy.

24:00.926 --> 24:02.729
But I'm sure he misses you, too.

24:03.228 --> 24:04.962
If I keep working hard like Sam,

24:05.029 --> 24:07.266
can I go to the city
and make furniture, too?

24:09.568 --> 24:10.836
I don't see why not.

24:12.204 --> 24:14.740
All right, you just focus on this.

24:14.805 --> 24:17.809
You need to see it in your
mind's eye what you want.

24:17.875 --> 24:19.511
And you need to see it through.

24:22.381 --> 24:24.117
Good.

24:25.016 --> 24:26.819
You're awake now, huh?

24:26.884 --> 24:29.454
I was afraid I hit you too
hard in all the excitement.

24:31.189 --> 24:32.424
It is Noah, right?

24:35.326 --> 24:36.769
My friends call me Patty.

24:37.295 --> 24:39.465
But I'll allow you
to call me Miss Cannon.

24:41.167 --> 24:42.502
Perhaps you've heard of me.

24:43.435 --> 24:44.737
Can't say that I have.

24:47.072 --> 24:49.089
Well, it must be my lucky day.

24:49.975 --> 24:53.001
'Cause I came down here for a
little old-fashioned justice

24:53.379 --> 24:56.222
and then I stumble
across one of the Macon seven.

24:57.016 --> 24:59.752
Your exploits have been
taxing my men for weeks.

25:00.584 --> 25:01.987
The marshals' station?

25:03.854 --> 25:05.324
Now, that was bold.

25:07.058 --> 25:08.860
Then I started asking myself...

25:10.895 --> 25:12.164
"Patty...

25:14.233 --> 25:18.237
"How does a runaway even know
where the marshals' station is?"

25:22.274 --> 25:23.910
I think you're working
with someone else.

25:25.943 --> 25:27.612
Someone white, I'm guessing.

25:31.682 --> 25:33.552
Someone who's part of the Underground.

25:39.591 --> 25:41.294
You know what I'm speaking of?

25:42.327 --> 25:43.528
No.

25:48.467 --> 25:50.035
I'm not one for torture.

25:51.070 --> 25:52.504
But a friend of mine

25:52.571 --> 25:55.207
taught me a little thing about it,

25:55.273 --> 25:57.509
before he passed.

25:57.575 --> 26:00.512
And I do have other business
to attend to today.

26:02.046 --> 26:03.315
I need a name.

26:05.016 --> 26:06.052
I can't.

26:07.218 --> 26:08.554
He took me in.

26:08.621 --> 26:10.189
- Offered me refuge.
- And you gave

26:10.255 --> 26:13.159
all that up the moment you walked
into the marshals' station.

26:14.558 --> 26:15.961
Hell of a distraction.

26:18.429 --> 26:20.199
I'm guessing for Rosalee.

26:20.900 --> 26:22.901
You're in a bit of a bind, John.

26:24.536 --> 26:26.332
Let me help you out of it.

26:26.671 --> 26:28.673
Like you helped... Elizabeth?

26:28.740 --> 26:29.842
You love her.

26:32.110 --> 26:34.280
You want to be with
her... I can do that.

26:35.648 --> 26:36.982
I'll let you go.

26:37.048 --> 26:38.917
No, you're not gonna kill me.

26:39.618 --> 26:41.487
That's not you.

26:41.553 --> 26:43.456
You're a man of the law.

26:43.522 --> 26:45.323
You're in over your head, Noah,

26:45.390 --> 26:47.426
and I'm the only one
who can help you now.

26:47.493 --> 26:49.795
All you've done...

26:51.196 --> 26:53.266
...you think it's not gonna
catch up with you?

26:53.998 --> 26:55.200
Give me a name.

26:55.967 --> 26:57.102
It'll catch up.

27:02.073 --> 27:03.208
His name...

27:04.576 --> 27:06.679
But it won't catch up to me.

27:08.714 --> 27:10.850
...is Marshal Kyle Risdin.

27:12.116 --> 27:13.517
While you've been down here,

27:13.584 --> 27:15.287
you want to know how
we've been spending our day?

27:17.054 --> 27:18.324
I dug a hideaway...

27:19.490 --> 27:20.959
...not unlike this one,

27:22.460 --> 27:24.729
under your home, Kyle.

27:24.796 --> 27:26.297
It's our hands...

27:26.364 --> 27:28.366
While my wife slipped a few
letters from William Still

27:28.433 --> 27:31.002
and some abolitionist writings
into your desk,

27:31.070 --> 27:34.506
as well as some handwritten
logs of patrol boat schedules.

27:34.573 --> 27:36.742
Governor, I had a thought
about the new river routes.

27:36.807 --> 27:39.844
And I've got some friends who
are going to mention your name.

27:39.911 --> 27:43.015
You ask for a lawyer, and you ask
for this one man, he'll help you.

27:43.081 --> 27:45.160
His name is Kyle Risdin.

27:45.817 --> 27:49.113
When I get out of here,
I'll clear it all up.

27:49.787 --> 27:51.522
I'll tell them
about you and Elizabeth...

27:51.590 --> 27:52.858
I'll tell them everything.

27:52.923 --> 27:55.527
The Fugitive Slave Act
is comprehensive and ironclad.

27:56.795 --> 27:58.873
Not only is it my right...

27:59.265 --> 28:01.400
...to kill a slave stealer...

28:02.901 --> 28:04.035
...it's my duty

28:04.902 --> 28:06.604
as a man of the law.

28:26.692 --> 28:29.694
Giddyap! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

28:29.761 --> 28:30.829
Giddyap!

28:34.933 --> 28:36.401
Giddyap!

28:46.476 --> 28:47.579
Giddyap!

28:49.947 --> 28:51.049
Hyah!

28:51.849 --> 28:53.185
Hyah!

28:59.756 --> 29:02.060
Giddyap! Giddyap!

29:02.127 --> 29:03.162
Hyah!

29:04.862 --> 29:06.597
- Stop the wagon.
- Giddyap!

29:06.665 --> 29:07.665
Stop the wagon!

29:07.732 --> 29:10.201
Whoa! Whoa. What are you doing?

29:10.268 --> 29:12.437
He wants me, not you and Boo.
I'll draw him away.

29:12.503 --> 29:14.105
We're not far from Ripley.
They know we're coming.

29:14.172 --> 29:16.208
Ain't gonna let no one else get
hurt 'cause of me. Go on now.

29:21.547 --> 29:23.148
Giddyap! Giddyap!

30:01.852 --> 30:03.169
Your boy...

30:04.222 --> 30:05.757
...he went and let me go.

30:05.823 --> 30:07.091
And so you stabbed him?

30:08.760 --> 30:10.028
I'm sorry for that.

30:10.095 --> 30:11.762
He ain't never gonna walk again.

30:13.564 --> 30:15.199
That ain't my fault. It's yours.

30:19.236 --> 30:20.638
Ben never should have been there.

30:21.873 --> 30:23.242
Didn't even want to be.

30:25.242 --> 30:26.278
You know that.

30:31.081 --> 30:32.450
I ain't running no more.

31:36.635 --> 31:38.404
You want to hunt us down
like we're animals?

31:38.471 --> 31:39.807
Well...

31:45.413 --> 31:47.147
...then you're gonna die
out here like one.

32:23.249 --> 32:24.975
The arrangements have all been made.

32:25.042 --> 32:26.385
We'll leave day after tomorrow.

32:26.452 --> 32:28.721
It's, uh, five days by train,
I was thinking we could

32:28.788 --> 32:31.391
stopover in Virginia, do some shopping.

32:31.458 --> 32:33.494
They're very fashionable in Washington.

32:33.559 --> 32:35.162
And I've heard
there's some private clubs

32:35.229 --> 32:37.131
where we could have dinner together.

32:37.198 --> 32:40.499
I promise you will have
whatever you want

32:40.866 --> 32:42.036
in our new life together.

32:42.435 --> 32:43.737
How does that sound?

32:45.573 --> 32:48.142
- It sounds nice.
- Hmm.

32:59.953 --> 33:01.588
You're thinking about James, aren't you?

33:01.654 --> 33:03.907
We can send for him
as soon as we get settled.

33:05.759 --> 33:07.995
I was actually thinking about Rosalee.

33:09.895 --> 33:12.799
I was so angry at her when she ran.

33:15.902 --> 33:17.171
Disappointed.

33:18.505 --> 33:20.007
That she could put herself

33:20.073 --> 33:22.076
in that kind of danger

33:22.349 --> 33:24.717
after I'd worked so hard
to keep her safe.

33:28.988 --> 33:31.591
But safety isn't real, is it?

33:33.051 --> 33:34.186
I suppose it's not.

33:35.862 --> 33:37.364
No! No!

33:41.162 --> 33:43.263
I was foolish

33:43.329 --> 33:44.931
to think that anything I could do

33:44.998 --> 33:46.700
would keep my children from danger.

33:48.234 --> 33:49.568
But that's how it works, right?

33:49.635 --> 33:51.504
Break the females
so they'll teach the chillun.

33:51.572 --> 33:53.574
- Stine! Please!
- Take his hands.

33:53.641 --> 33:55.976
It's a hard lesson, fool...

33:56.043 --> 33:58.045
...because anything less than blood

33:58.112 --> 34:01.582
and you can't get the body to act
against its own best nature.

34:03.650 --> 34:06.854
But my daughter was smart enough
to see through it.

34:06.920 --> 34:08.898
Please...

34:08.963 --> 34:10.876
There's no surviving this life.

34:12.293 --> 34:14.728
Stine...

34:15.594 --> 34:16.838
Oh, God...

34:17.898 --> 34:19.827
Don't worry.

34:22.735 --> 34:26.039
Ain't neither of us is gonna
answer to Him for our sins.

34:28.995 --> 34:30.895
We both going to hell.

34:37.869 --> 34:39.338
You just a bit sooner.

35:22.027 --> 35:23.163
Good.

35:25.465 --> 35:27.117
Good, you're awake.

35:27.934 --> 35:30.905
We tried to patch you up as best we
could before we brought you here.

35:33.474 --> 35:34.975
It's a great job we have,

35:35.809 --> 35:36.977
slave catchin'.

35:38.591 --> 35:40.093
We can do whatever we want.

35:41.114 --> 35:42.606
With one...

35:43.216 --> 35:44.818
...really only one exception.

35:47.794 --> 35:50.663
You can't kill white people, August.

35:51.890 --> 35:53.492
Especially not any of mine.

36:09.376 --> 36:13.079
Lord...

36:13.146 --> 36:15.248
...make me an instrument of peace.

36:16.784 --> 36:21.055
Where there's hatred, let me sow love.

36:23.389 --> 36:27.285
Where there is injury, pardon.

36:29.093 --> 36:30.931
Where there is doubt,

36:31.565 --> 36:32.986
faith.

36:36.869 --> 36:39.518
Where there is despair, hope. ♪

36:42.009 --> 36:44.872
Where there is darkness, light.

36:48.780 --> 36:52.308
Where there is... sadness, joy.

36:54.693 --> 36:58.230
Grant that I may not
so much seek to be consoled...

36:59.291 --> 37:00.994
...as to console.

37:04.164 --> 37:07.268
To be understood as to understand.

37:09.436 --> 37:11.572
To be loved as to love.

37:12.773 --> 37:15.041
For it is in giving that we receive.

37:16.376 --> 37:19.756
It is in pardoning that we are pardoned.

37:20.679 --> 37:25.985
It is in dying that we are
born again to eternal life.

37:26.052 --> 37:27.954
What you want to know
about the Macon seven?

37:28.021 --> 37:29.223
Everything.

37:30.456 --> 37:31.557
Why?

37:33.092 --> 37:35.995
Because if we don't
remember our own stories,

37:36.063 --> 37:37.731
who will?

37:37.798 --> 37:39.732
I wonder how much
she gonna remember of all this

37:40.011 --> 37:41.180
when she grow up.

37:42.668 --> 37:45.505
More pain than her little heart
should ever have to bear.

37:49.175 --> 37:52.679
But I want her to remember how
fiercely her momma loved her.

37:54.114 --> 37:58.104
As she stopped a slave catcher
with her own body

37:58.652 --> 38:01.355
just to make sure that her
baby girl made it to freedom.

38:02.722 --> 38:04.958
And that her daddy, Moses,
carried her as far

38:05.025 --> 38:07.471
as he could on his own

38:08.153 --> 38:10.289
so that Pearly Mae's sacrifice
wasn't for nothin'.

38:13.097 --> 38:15.133
And I want her to remember Zeke.

38:16.789 --> 38:20.693
He was the biggest man
with the softest heart.

38:22.293 --> 38:24.429
He went down fightin',
just like Henry...

38:25.311 --> 38:26.646
That boy,

38:27.880 --> 38:30.283
bullets couldn't even stop Henry.

38:30.351 --> 38:32.318
He was braver than even he knew.

38:35.188 --> 38:36.824
And Cato was brave, too,

38:37.724 --> 38:39.059
but broken.

38:40.825 --> 38:43.429
I wish he would've had
a chance to start over.

38:46.166 --> 38:47.468
And Noah...

38:54.007 --> 38:56.909
Noah was the one that
brought us the freedom song.

38:56.976 --> 38:58.478
Brought us all together.

39:01.981 --> 39:04.050
He knew we were stronger as a group,

39:04.117 --> 39:05.752
that we couldn't do it alone,

39:05.818 --> 39:07.788
and that we're all meant to be free.

39:11.358 --> 39:12.659
He was right.

39:12.726 --> 39:14.961
We made it to the other side
of that river.

39:16.996 --> 39:19.166
But he gave up his freedom for me.

39:23.594 --> 39:25.781
I wasn't supposed
to be part of the Macon seven,

39:25.902 --> 39:29.072
but he saw a strength in me
I didn't even know I had.

39:34.681 --> 39:36.583
I believe wherever he is,

39:36.650 --> 39:38.451
he's still fightin',

39:38.518 --> 39:41.121
still plannin', never givin' up.

39:42.121 --> 39:43.690
Because that's who he is.

39:45.358 --> 39:47.460
And if it wasn't for him,
if it wasn't for all of them,

39:47.527 --> 39:49.530
I wouldn't be sittin' here
with you today.

39:51.063 --> 39:53.532
Back on the plantation, I was so scared.

39:53.599 --> 39:55.302
Wasn't no time to feel nothin' else.

39:55.369 --> 39:57.336
You just had to keep your head down.

39:57.403 --> 40:00.106
"Yes, massa." Look away. Bear it.

40:00.173 --> 40:01.474
But every slight, every insult,

40:01.541 --> 40:03.142
every time they used
that word "girl" in a way

40:03.208 --> 40:05.678
that made me hate the word,

40:05.744 --> 40:08.681
all that anger just waitin'
below the surface.

40:10.050 --> 40:11.785
All that's behind you now.

40:14.052 --> 40:15.388
No, it ain't.

40:16.490 --> 40:17.991
I can't look away no more.

40:18.057 --> 40:19.958
And if I stay up here
and try to start a new life,

40:20.025 --> 40:21.527
that's all I'm gonna be doin'.

40:25.783 --> 40:27.185
I'm goin' back.

40:43.016 --> 40:45.284
I know you've felt some...

40:45.351 --> 40:48.221
...coldness between us over the years.

40:51.257 --> 40:54.327
I want you to know it's not because
you were layin' with my husband.

40:56.630 --> 40:59.967
We've all had our dalliances
with your kind.

41:01.835 --> 41:03.836
There was a stable boy

41:03.902 --> 41:06.506
who worked the horses
when I was Mary's age.

41:13.112 --> 41:16.682
And it's not because you
bore my husband's children.

41:16.749 --> 41:18.851
That's nothin' more than free labor.

41:20.920 --> 41:22.355
But my children,

41:23.956 --> 41:26.859
they were the one thing
I was promised would be mine.

41:28.720 --> 41:29.956
And they look to you...

41:31.731 --> 41:33.367
...as if you're their mother.

41:35.381 --> 41:37.850
When they laugh, it's with you.

41:39.605 --> 41:41.041
When they cry,

41:42.480 --> 41:44.249
they call out for Stine.

41:57.190 --> 42:00.393
I've waited a long time
to repay that kindness.

42:00.460 --> 42:03.465
- Whoa, whoa.
- And now that Tom is...

42:04.496 --> 42:05.731
...gone,

42:07.212 --> 42:08.881
there's nothin' stoppin' me...

42:13.773 --> 42:15.576
...from puttin' you on the block.

42:24.208 --> 42:26.978
Don't worry on James.

42:28.265 --> 42:30.202
I'm gonna bring him back in the house.

42:31.050 --> 42:32.885
Raise him as my own.

42:35.094 --> 42:37.363
Give him a better life
than you ever could.
