WEBVTT

00:07.600 --> 00:10.331
<i>I'll rip your dick
off, you son of</i> a <i>bitch!</i>

00:10.440 --> 00:11.726
<i>My eye!</i>

00:12.440 --> 00:14.647
On behalf of the entire Disrupt conference,

00:14.720 --> 00:19.442
I would like to apologize
for what happened out there this afternoon.

00:19.560 --> 00:22.530
This man will never be
asked to judge again.

00:22.720 --> 00:25.929
I've just learned he's been, uh,
fired from Oracle,

00:26.000 --> 00:27.525
and apparently his wife left him.

00:27.880 --> 00:32.363
Anyway, I just got a call from
your attorney, Mr. LaFlamme,

00:32.439 --> 00:37.731
informing me that in his view, this
incident is actionable.

00:37.960 --> 00:41.965
Uh, and in addition to
holding TechCrunch liable for any damages,

00:42.040 --> 00:44.008
which may include the loss to Pied Piper

00:44.080 --> 00:47.721
of potentially billions
in revenue and share value, uh,

00:47.800 --> 00:52.442
he may be naming me
personally in a lawsuit.

00:52.800 --> 00:57.727
So, I would like to propose that we,
uh, put this incident behind us,

00:57.800 --> 01:03.125
legally speaking, uh, by sending Pied Piper
directly through to the finals

01:03.200 --> 01:07.603
of Startup Battlefield,
where you will compete for the grand prize.

01:08.280 --> 01:10.248
- How does that sound?
- I think that's...

01:10.320 --> 01:15.008
One question, uh,
regarding our hotel accommodations?

01:21.680 --> 01:24.251
Barn! Am I right, guys?

01:26.040 --> 01:28.805
I was just happy
you got punched in the face, Erlich,

01:28.880 --> 01:32.566
but now I'm super happy.
I feel like I won twice.

01:32.760 --> 01:34.842
I'm gonna disrupt this bathroom.

01:37.080 --> 01:40.289
I don't think this couch pulls out.
I guess I'll get myself a roll-away bed.

01:40.600 --> 01:44.321
I mean, you're welcome, guys.
I had to fuck a wife and take a punch,

01:44.400 --> 01:46.721
but now we get to go
into the finals tomorrow

01:46.800 --> 01:48.848
without having blown our
wad in the prelims.

01:49.520 --> 01:51.966
We're trending up, boys.
We are trending up.

01:52.040 --> 01:54.247
Maybe you're right.
But, uh, we should probably

01:54.320 --> 01:56.721
get back down there
and check out the competition.

01:57.160 --> 02:00.209
<i>- Ladies and gentlemen, Gavin Belson.</i>

02:03.200 --> 02:06.727
<i>No matter what you may have heard,
size matters.</i>

02:07.320 --> 02:11.041
<i>Welcome, everyone,
to a journey into the Nucleus.</i>

02:11.120 --> 02:12.360
I hope this sucks.

02:12.440 --> 02:15.046
<i>Nucleus will provide the
most diverse features</i>

02:15.120 --> 02:17.726
<i>ever assembled in
a cloud-based compression suite.</i>

02:17.960 --> 02:21.043
<i>Massive functionality, inter-connectivity,</i>

02:21.160 --> 02:24.403
<i>and the simplicity one has come
to expect from the Hooli family.</i>

02:24.480 --> 02:28.883
<i>We're making all your files available
for lightning-fast download.</i>

02:29.160 --> 02:30.969
<i>Accessible from any device.</i>

02:31.240 --> 02:35.484
<i>AH these features will be
seamlessly synced to Hooli-mail,</i>

02:35.560 --> 02:39.770
<i>Hooli-search and the full suite
of Hooli computing power.</i>

02:39.840 --> 02:41.649
That's a lot of functionality.

02:41.720 --> 02:44.401
Don't worry,
he can't come close to our Weissman score.

02:44.640 --> 02:48.167
Even with all this extra shit,
it's like a fancy car with a crappy engine.

02:48.240 --> 02:50.527
<i>And now, for the moment of truth.</i>

02:50.920 --> 02:56.927
<i>As you will now see, our Weissman score
is the best in the history of compression.</i>

02:59.440 --> 03:00.487
What the fuck?

03:00.560 --> 03:02.528
That's exactly the same score as us.

03:02.760 --> 03:06.446
<i>2.89. That is not an error.</i>

03:07.080 --> 03:12.086
<i>We are breathing rare air here, operating
at the limit for lossless compression</i>

03:12.560 --> 03:14.961
<i>in audio, video and</i> data.

03:15.440 --> 03:20.048
<i>Anyone who tells you that their platform is
faster than ours better have good lawyers.</i>

03:21.080 --> 03:23.401
<i>I hope you've enjoyed your journey
into the Nucleus.</i>

03:23.720 --> 03:28.442
<i>We have the speed. We have the features.
And we have...</i>

03:28.560 --> 03:29.561
Shakira!

03:33.920 --> 03:35.365
Hola, TechCrunch!

03:48.240 --> 03:50.561
I mean, they just completely

03:50.640 --> 03:53.484
reverse-engineered
our entire compression engine.

03:53.560 --> 03:55.130
He totally sniped us.

03:55.360 --> 03:57.010
- We'll be fine.
- What?

03:57.560 --> 04:00.643
They judge this contest
on viability in the marketplace.

04:01.080 --> 04:04.402
I mean, at best,
we're a worse version of Nucleus.

04:04.680 --> 04:07.047
I mean, they have 50 modules,
and they're all awesome.

04:07.120 --> 04:08.770
We have five that barely work.

04:08.840 --> 04:12.765
I mean, we're still having trouble compressing
3-D files. Who's lining up to buy that?

04:12.840 --> 04:14.251
Who the fuck cares?

04:14.320 --> 04:18.644
So the platform can't handle 3-D files.
You know what, 3-D movies suck anyway.

04:18.839 --> 04:21.649
I could actually argue this Gavin nonsense
is a positive.

04:21.720 --> 04:22.721
Please don't.

04:22.800 --> 04:25.007
We just need to really dial it up
for the big show tomorrow.

04:25.080 --> 04:26.684
Dial what up? He just ruined us.

04:26.760 --> 04:30.128
And until then, we need to do what any
animal in nature does when it's cornered,

04:30.200 --> 04:33.568
act erratically, and blindly lash
out at everything around us.

04:33.640 --> 04:35.210
I'm gonna go get in Gavin's head.

04:35.480 --> 04:39.451
Hey, guys, I just had a thought.
Okay, so this is it, right?

04:39.520 --> 04:42.808
A lot of successful start-ups launched
with a different business model,

04:42.880 --> 04:45.804
and when they ran into trouble,
they pivoted to something new, right?

04:45.880 --> 04:49.771
Like lnstagram. That was a location-based
check-in service when it started,

04:49.840 --> 04:50.887
and then they pivoted.

04:51.040 --> 04:53.520
Or Chatroulette, okay,
that was social media,

04:53.600 --> 04:57.685
and then they pivoted to become
a playground for the sexually monstrous.

04:58.120 --> 05:01.488
We just need a new idea, something that
people want. Right? We can pivot, too.

05:01.880 --> 05:05.601
- Dude, you are fucked up right now.
- Yeah, you're pinning bad.

05:05.680 --> 05:07.330
Well, I'll admit, I'm sleep-challenged.

05:07.400 --> 05:10.483
I just spent four days
trapped in a steel box out on an oil rig

05:10.560 --> 05:12.050
full of robot-forklifts.

05:12.120 --> 05:14.441
So, that was hard, but I'm back.

05:14.520 --> 05:18.809
I am recovering and I am focused and we're
gonna pivot. Don't lose faith, guys.

05:18.960 --> 05:21.167
All right, look at me. Look at me.
Look at me.

05:22.240 --> 05:24.720
We've got a great name.
We've got a great team.

05:24.800 --> 05:27.246
We've got a great logo,
and we've got a great name.

05:27.400 --> 05:28.925
Now we just need an idea.

05:29.080 --> 05:31.560
Let's pivot! Let's pivot!

05:34.600 --> 05:36.602
That might be the last
time we see him alive.

05:36.680 --> 05:39.843
Ah, I think I'm just gonna take a walk
and, you know, try and clear my head.

05:39.920 --> 05:44.767
I'll see you guys back at the hotel room
and we'll figure out what to do.

05:46.920 --> 05:48.445
We're going to be poor.

05:49.760 --> 05:53.810
Hi! I'd like to talk to you
about a company called Pied Piper.

05:53.880 --> 05:55.450
What does it do? Good question.

05:55.600 --> 05:57.170
Maybe you can help us find an answer.

05:57.560 --> 06:01.406
What if Pied Piper was an app
that could attract rodents?

06:01.480 --> 06:02.925
You know, like the fairy tale?

06:03.000 --> 06:06.368
For purposes of extermination
or to feed your pet snake.

06:06.440 --> 06:09.284
We're not here to tell you
what to do with your rats,

06:09.360 --> 06:11.522
we're here to get you rats, stat.

06:11.640 --> 06:14.928
Would you be very interested,
somewhat interested or not interested?

06:15.000 --> 06:18.721
Which one? Which one? Which one?

06:21.680 --> 06:25.765
Look at them, all full of hope. Pricks.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.321
Oh, look,
Kwerpy's here recruiting.

06:28.560 --> 06:33.248
They just got 20 million in Series A
at a $280 million dollar valuation.

06:33.320 --> 06:35.721
- Wow.
- That could have been us.

06:37.160 --> 06:40.482
It's too bad we already have jobs,
we could easily go work there.

06:40.800 --> 06:42.165
Yeah.

06:43.000 --> 06:46.800
It'd be a real dickhead move
to bail on Richard now, right?

06:46.880 --> 06:49.850
I mean, before we officially go under.

06:50.280 --> 06:53.489
- Yeah. Yeah. Total dickhead move.
- Yeah. Yeah.

06:55.800 --> 06:58.690
Yeah, even though it is
just a matter of days.

06:58.760 --> 07:02.685
- And we are so close.
- I mean, he is standing right there.

07:03.440 --> 07:05.329
- But I'm not a dickhead.
- No. Neither am I.

07:05.400 --> 07:06.840
Yep, just a couple of non-dickheads.

07:06.880 --> 07:08.086
My dick and my head, totally separate.

07:08.160 --> 07:10.925
You've heard the phrase,
"Time to pay the piper," right?

07:11.680 --> 07:15.287
What if there was an app
called Pied Piper that could tell you,

07:15.360 --> 07:19.160
to a statistical degree of certainty,
whether you were going to heaven or hell?

07:19.760 --> 07:22.604
Very interested, somewhat interested,
not interested?

07:23.280 --> 07:26.045
Which one? Which one? Which one?

07:27.120 --> 07:29.646
So you made some really
over-the-top promises about Nucleus.

07:29.760 --> 07:31.569
- Can you deliver?
- Absolutely.

07:32.040 --> 07:36.170
For me, Kara, goodness, greatness,
these are not simply catchphrases,

07:36.240 --> 07:38.527
but, in fact, really the intention of Hooli
from the beginning.

07:38.600 --> 07:41.888
Gavin, you do not need
to dignify any of this with a response!

07:41.960 --> 07:45.009
I can speak for myself.
Erlich Bachman, Pied Piper.

07:45.080 --> 07:47.208
Was I brutally assaulted? Yes.

07:47.520 --> 07:50.364
Did Gavin Belson here have
anything to do with it? Unclear.

07:50.440 --> 07:55.367
All I know is that the rumor that
TechCrunch is all abuzz about is unproven.

07:55.720 --> 07:57.210
- Wait, what rumor?
- Thank you.

07:57.280 --> 07:59.601
Why would Gavin
have anything to do with this?

07:59.680 --> 08:04.811
Unless he had some reason to be frightened
by Pied Piper and its superior technology?

08:05.040 --> 08:09.364
This and all other Gavin Belson rumors
are unsubstantiated.

08:09.440 --> 08:12.842
Okay, the alcoholism,
the sexual impropriety at work,

08:13.160 --> 08:15.891
the impending crash of Hooli's stock...

08:16.000 --> 08:17.604
This is the most ridiculous...

08:17.680 --> 08:20.604
Exactly. So why repeat
the lascivious details,

08:20.720 --> 08:23.485
with which all of us
are undoubtedly already familiar?

08:23.560 --> 08:26.325
Guilty or not, Gavin, I stand with you.

08:27.040 --> 08:28.041
Care to comment?

08:32.080 --> 08:33.320
Let's keep moving, shall we?

08:33.400 --> 08:36.085
Yes, let's all keep moving.
Let's move on from this.

08:36.200 --> 08:40.046
I forgive you, Gavin.
No matter how brutally I was assaulted.

08:40.679 --> 08:43.285
Wow, Pied Piper sounds like
a great place to work.

08:43.360 --> 08:44.441
Oh, yeah, it is.

08:44.600 --> 08:46.762
Pied Piper is the best, right?

08:46.880 --> 08:49.770
Oh, my God, every day feels like
I've died and gone to hell.

08:50.160 --> 08:51.161
I'm sorry.

08:51.240 --> 08:53.083
- He's a Satanist, so it's good.
- Mmm-hmm.

08:53.240 --> 08:56.050
- Oh, fun.
- The point is, we love our company,

08:56.120 --> 08:57.724
and I don't have a problem
saying that out loud.

08:57.800 --> 08:59.131
- You...
- Love it

08:59.200 --> 09:01.441
We both say it out loud
and I think that fact,

09:01.560 --> 09:03.801
proves that we're not dickheads.

09:05.800 --> 09:07.962
So what we wanted to ask you was...

09:08.040 --> 09:09.121
Guys?

09:10.480 --> 09:13.563
Totally between us, our beta crapped out.

09:14.400 --> 09:17.609
The VCs did a full claw back
and our Series A is DOA.

09:17.680 --> 09:22.083
We're going down. We have enough runway
for maybe two, three weeks max.

09:22.640 --> 09:23.801
So...

09:25.360 --> 09:26.930
Do you guys think you could hire me?

09:32.800 --> 09:37.044
How much would it be worth to you if I told
you I had a GPS app called Pied Piper,

09:37.120 --> 09:38.804
tracking the location of your child?

09:39.040 --> 09:40.610
I can follow your child anywhere,

09:40.680 --> 09:42.728
and there is nothing you can do to stop me.

09:43.160 --> 09:45.527
Most missing children are never found.

09:45.920 --> 09:48.161
Interested, very interested,
or very interested?

09:52.520 --> 09:54.443
Richard. Hi...

09:54.520 --> 09:57.251
- Hey... Uh, suitcase. Yeah.
- Yeah.

09:57.320 --> 09:59.084
So you're, uh...

09:59.480 --> 10:00.720
Peter called.

10:00.800 --> 10:04.441
- He saw Erlich's presentation, such as it was.
- Ah.

10:04.520 --> 10:05.851
And Gavin's.

10:07.080 --> 10:08.969
So he wants me to go back to Palo Alto.

10:09.320 --> 10:12.051
There's just a few other things
that he wants me working on.

10:12.400 --> 10:14.880
Now that we're, you know,
dead in the water.

10:15.200 --> 10:18.602
Listen, I'm sorry you walked away
from the money like you did.

10:18.720 --> 10:20.802
But I swear I only wanted Peter to seed you

10:20.880 --> 10:23.000
because I thought
that you had a really great company.

10:23.040 --> 10:25.884
- Mmm.
- It just didn't work out for you this time.

10:25.960 --> 10:27.530
Uh...
Can I be honest with you?

10:27.600 --> 10:31.286
I haven't had more than
two straight hours of sleep in months.

10:31.400 --> 10:33.562
I've had a cold for, like, a year.

10:33.960 --> 10:36.611
My stomach cramps up so much
I feel like I'm menstruating.

10:37.720 --> 10:39.006
Maybe this is for the better.

10:40.720 --> 10:43.007
Look, I gotta go. Um...

10:43.360 --> 10:45.806
I'm really sorry that we're not gonna
be working together anymore.

10:45.880 --> 10:47.530
Yeah, me too.

10:48.440 --> 10:51.489
I guess...
I guess we won't see each other again.

10:52.040 --> 10:55.522
Well, I mean, now that the rules
about socializing with coworkers

10:55.600 --> 10:59.286
aren't in effect anymore, let me know
if you want to grab a drink sometime.

11:00.320 --> 11:02.129
What, like a "drink"? A "drink-drink"?

11:03.400 --> 11:05.400
You go on dates with failures?

11:06.400 --> 11:08.687
- Constantly.
- Okay.

11:09.920 --> 11:10.921
Uh...

11:11.000 --> 11:13.367
- Bye. Okay.
- Bye.

11:16.160 --> 11:18.970
You have any weapons or drugs
on your person at this time?

11:19.760 --> 11:22.047
- Why, yes. Yes, I do.
- Huh.

11:23.760 --> 11:24.761
Let's go.

11:26.480 --> 11:29.643
Adderall. This is a highly controlled
substance. Are these yours?

11:29.720 --> 11:32.963
No! Those belong to an underage kid
that I brought to my house.

11:33.760 --> 11:36.366
Yeah, sir, I'm going to have
to ask you to come with me.

11:36.440 --> 11:39.364
That's a kind invitation,
but I have too much to do. I'm pivoting!

11:39.480 --> 11:41.608
- Let's go now!
- No. I'm pivoting! I'm pivoting!

11:41.720 --> 11:42.721
I'm pivoting!

11:44.800 --> 11:48.202
I mean, what do we even present tomorrow?

11:48.280 --> 11:49.691
Honestly, anyone?

11:49.760 --> 11:51.250
Why do we have to present at all?

11:51.480 --> 11:52.641
What's that supposed to mean?

11:52.720 --> 11:54.245
If we are going to fail and be humiliated,

11:54.320 --> 11:57.403
why do it on stage in front of 1,000 people
and a live-streamed audience?

11:57.680 --> 11:59.603
Are you saying we shouldn't even show up?

11:59.720 --> 12:03.088
No offense, but it's basically
going to be a public execution.

12:03.200 --> 12:05.487
Yes, and public executions
are very popular.

12:05.720 --> 12:08.291
It's show business.
We are not quitting, Richard.

12:08.480 --> 12:11.723
Look, Erlich, I want to
present, I do, it's just...

12:11.800 --> 12:13.529
I don't know.

12:18.320 --> 12:20.129
Jesus, are you okay?

12:20.200 --> 12:22.771
What? Yeah, I... Okay.

12:22.840 --> 12:24.524
Yeah, all good. They let me go.

12:24.880 --> 12:27.406
- Who let you go?
- When was the last time you slept, Jared?

12:27.480 --> 12:30.131
Yeah, absolutely, David.

12:30.200 --> 12:31.840
What are we talking about, gents?

12:31.880 --> 12:34.850
We're talking about
how I didn't get to present in the prelims,

12:34.920 --> 12:36.888
because I was too busy
getting my face pummeled

12:36.960 --> 12:38.450
so that our team could move forward.

12:38.520 --> 12:40.124
That's why we're presenting tomorrow.

12:40.320 --> 12:42.322
And you know what? We're going to win.

12:42.400 --> 12:46.485
Yeah, we're gonna win even if I have to go
into the auditorium and personally jerk off

12:46.560 --> 12:47.846
every guy in the audience.

12:48.360 --> 12:49.930
That's a lot of jerking.

12:50.840 --> 12:53.605
And we only have 10
minutes to present. So...

12:54.040 --> 12:56.441
So, we're fucked, aren't we?

12:58.480 --> 13:02.804
Yeah, even if he's jerking two at a time,
there are, what, 800 guys in that room?

13:02.880 --> 13:05.929
So that's 400 times
whatever the mean jerk-time is.

13:06.040 --> 13:07.929
- The what?
- Mean jerk-time.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.207
I mean, it doesn't matter,
but, hypothetically,

13:10.280 --> 13:13.568
time is equal to 400 total jerks
at a two-dick rate.

13:14.320 --> 13:17.767
Unless Erlich jerks off four guys at a
time, and then we can cut that in half.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.411
How would he do four guys...

13:19.480 --> 13:22.211
He's got two hands,
so that's two dicks at a time, right?

13:22.320 --> 13:25.881
Look, you have two guys on either side
with their dicks, tip to tip,

13:25.960 --> 13:29.362
so you're going full-length. Four, see?

13:29.440 --> 13:30.441
Oh...

13:30.720 --> 13:32.449
From the middle out. That does make sense.

13:32.520 --> 13:33.520
Like two Shake Weights?

13:33.560 --> 13:35.847
Yeah, so what we're trying to do,
hypothetically,

13:35.960 --> 13:39.487
is minimize time, which is 800 dudes,

13:39.560 --> 13:43.326
multiplied by mean-jerk time,
divided by four dicks at a time.

13:43.400 --> 13:47.769
Of course, Erlich would have to pre-sort guys
by height, so that their dicks lined up.

13:47.840 --> 13:49.365
Not by height, technically.

13:49.480 --> 13:53.007
The measurement that we're looking
for, really, is dick-to-floor.

13:53.520 --> 13:55.682
- Call that D2F.
- Huh.

13:56.240 --> 13:57.366
Oh, my God.

13:57.480 --> 13:59.767
You know, if a guy's dick was long enough,

13:59.840 --> 14:03.890
it would be able to reach up or down
to another guy with a different D2F.

14:03.960 --> 14:07.487
The longer the dick,
the greater the D2F bridge,

14:07.560 --> 14:11.451
but I would still be able
to jerk it off in one smooth motion.

14:11.760 --> 14:13.410
I would just have to jerk it on an angle.

14:13.480 --> 14:15.801
So D2F sub-1 needs
to equal D2F sub-2,

14:15.880 --> 14:18.121
and D2F sub-3 needs to equal D2F sub-4,

14:18.200 --> 14:23.240
where length, L, creates
a complementary shaft angle.

14:23.320 --> 14:24.651
Call that theta D.

14:24.960 --> 14:27.440
- Now, the orgasm threshold...
- Holy shit. Oh, my God.

14:28.600 --> 14:30.489
I'm such an idiot. Middle out!

14:30.680 --> 14:33.809
Middle out! Middle out! Oh, my God.

14:33.880 --> 14:35.211
HOW could I...

14:37.920 --> 14:40.810
Guys, does girth-similarity
affect Erlich's ability

14:40.880 --> 14:43.486
to jerk different dicks simultaneously?

14:47.760 --> 14:49.603
Shit. Yeah, I think it would.

15:01.760 --> 15:06.561
Of course, it does. Time to orgasm, or T20,

15:07.000 --> 15:08.809
has to be the same for each
matching pair of dicks,

15:08.880 --> 15:11.880
otherwise I'm wasting a lot of great
strokes on a guy that's already busted.

15:11.920 --> 15:16.369
Unless you can hotswap dicks in and out.
So on a downstroke, you get a new one in.

15:16.440 --> 15:18.480
So when you stroke up
you're not wasting any energy.

15:18.560 --> 15:21.325
Even so. I think this is
the most reliable metric for stamina.

15:21.440 --> 15:26.924
Guys? Richard's been locked in here for
almost two hours. Do we think he's okay?

15:27.840 --> 15:29.330
Hmm, you don't think he'd...

15:29.400 --> 15:30.686
He did seem pretty bummed out.

16:10.560 --> 16:11.607
All right, guys, let's go.

16:11.680 --> 16:13.284
- The finals are starting.
- Up!

16:13.360 --> 16:14.407
Gilfoyle!

16:14.960 --> 16:16.007
Jesus!

16:17.760 --> 16:20.161
What happened to the door?

16:20.240 --> 16:22.163
Don't worry about it, Richard.
Ls the platform up and running?

16:22.240 --> 16:25.164
I made a few changes, but yeah...

16:25.240 --> 16:28.164
Okay, tell me on the walk.
All right, you dildos, let's go!

16:28.480 --> 16:30.847
All right, talk to me, Richard.
What were you working on last night?

16:30.920 --> 16:32.763
Well, uh,
I might've made a breakthrough.

16:32.840 --> 16:34.161
Really, so everything is working?

16:34.200 --> 16:35.884
Uh, technically, no.

17:06.599 --> 17:09.604
Let's face it, ladies,
is there anything less sexy

17:09.680 --> 17:13.480
than when a user's visualization UX
is completely sub-optimal?

17:13.800 --> 17:15.801
I mean, it's the worst, right?

17:15.880 --> 17:18.121
So we've gone through all the research
and all the steps.

17:18.160 --> 17:21.960
We have a solution for these problems and Zenella
is ready to bring it to the marketplace.

17:22.040 --> 17:24.167
Yeah, I get it, Richard. You changed a lot.

17:24.240 --> 17:25.969
Now, just give me the basics
and I can roll with it.

17:26.040 --> 17:27.565
I need to know what I'm presenting here.

17:27.640 --> 17:29.400
I don't think I have
time to explain it all.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.047
What the hell does that mean?

17:31.120 --> 17:33.930
Richard? Is this the right build?
I can't find the mobile suite here.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.685
Uh, it is nowhere. I deleted it.

17:36.960 --> 17:38.325
- What?
- Here they are.

17:38.680 --> 17:40.444
- Pied Piper's here.
- Sorry, we're late.

17:40.840 --> 17:42.126
Richard, talk to me.

17:42.240 --> 17:44.447
I can't front a band without
knowing what we're playing?

17:44.640 --> 17:48.770
Uh, I think I'm just going
to do the presentation myself.

17:49.040 --> 17:51.088
Wait, what? No, no, no,
Richard, Richard, Richard, Richard.

17:51.160 --> 17:53.811
Respectfully... Respectfully,
you're terrible.

17:54.040 --> 17:56.122
You have a world-class showman
standing right in front of you

17:56.200 --> 17:57.361
and you're going to pass on that?

17:57.440 --> 17:59.966
Release me, Richard. Release the Kraken!

18:00.040 --> 18:03.283
- Pied Piper. You're on.
- This is it!

18:03.360 --> 18:06.523
I don't know what you did, Richard,
but I hope it works.

18:06.600 --> 18:07.601
Me, 1100.

18:07.960 --> 18:10.770
<i>All right, let's welcome
our final team to the finals</i>

18:10.840 --> 18:14.128
<i>of this year's
TechCrunch Disrupt Startup Battlefield.</i>

18:14.200 --> 18:17.568
<i>- Presenting for Pied
Piper is Erlich Bachman.</i>

18:23.360 --> 18:26.443
<i>Uh, actually there has
been a change of plans.</i>

18:26.520 --> 18:29.967
<i>Presenting for Pied Piper
will be Richard Hendricks.</i>

18:36.360 --> 18:37.646
<i>Richard?</i>

18:40.440 --> 18:43.125
Ah, sorry. Got a little
light-headed there for a second.

18:43.200 --> 18:45.567
I set 'em up for you, now knock 'em down.

18:46.960 --> 18:49.804
I don't understand.
I thought he made the platform better.

18:49.880 --> 18:52.690
- He just deleted everything.
- Maybe he moved it to the cloud?

18:52.760 --> 18:55.809
No. All The Carver's work is gone.

18:56.040 --> 18:59.726
Pied Piper is a cloud-based compression.
Without the cloud, nothing's left.

18:59.800 --> 19:01.768
Uh, gentlemen,
this is likely the last 10 minutes

19:01.840 --> 19:04.286
of Pied Piper, so let's enjoy it.

19:04.360 --> 19:06.488
- Has he lost his mind?
- He's lost his fucking mind.

19:06.560 --> 19:09.166
<i>Hello... Hello. Hello.</i>

19:09.440 --> 19:12.683
<i>Um, I am... My name is Richard Hendricks,</i>

19:12.760 --> 19:17.482
<i>and I am, along with,
uh, this guy, him, him,</i>

19:18.160 --> 19:21.801
<i>and another guy that has disappeared,</i> uh...

19:23.840 --> 19:24.841
Um...

19:24.920 --> 19:27.571
<i>We are Pied Piper. A compression company.</i>

19:27.640 --> 19:29.210
<i>Well, you know, in your pamphlets</i>

19:29.280 --> 19:30.850
<i>it says that we are a cloud-based</i>

19:30.920 --> 19:34.049
<i>multi-platform solution
for user-focused compression.</i>

19:34.240 --> 19:37.642
<i>Uh, and we were. Until yesterday.</i>

19:38.040 --> 19:39.963
<i>But now we are not.</i>

19:41.920 --> 19:44.002
<i>Uh, because you see, Hooli</i>

19:44.120 --> 19:47.408
<i>did everything that we were trying
to do, uh, better, way better.</i>

19:47.720 --> 19:48.926
Um...

19:49.600 --> 19:55.084
<i>Nucleus is built on the same engine
as ours, like exactly the same,</i>

19:55.160 --> 19:59.006
<i>and their Weissman score was 2.89,
same as ours.</i>

19:59.320 --> 20:03.245
<i>But the thing is, they built a ton
of really great stuff up on top of that.</i>

20:03.320 --> 20:07.325
<i>And we can't compete,
so now we have to be something else.</i>

20:07.640 --> 20:09.802
<i>Um, well-played, Hooli.</i>

20:09.880 --> 20:15.569
<i>Uh, okay, so anyway, we all know
that the most obvious way</i>

20:16.480 --> 20:19.404
<i>to compress files is with
Shannon coding, right? Top down.</i>

20:19.480 --> 20:22.131
Richard, they
can't see that, it's too small.

20:22.800 --> 20:24.245
- Okay.
- Literally, hundreds of people here.

20:24.320 --> 20:25.446
<i>Oh, no, but I need...</i>

20:27.400 --> 20:28.811
<i>Shit,</i> okay.

20:28.920 --> 20:29.921
Um...

20:31.000 --> 20:32.331
<i>Right, oh.</i>

20:32.480 --> 20:36.201
<i>Uh, so Shannon coding
and then David Huffman came along,</i>

20:36.280 --> 20:40.968
<i>and he pioneered bottom-up, and
Lempel-Ziv with left-to-right, obviously.</i>

20:41.040 --> 20:43.850
<i>And for decades,
we used these codes to compress,</i>

20:43.920 --> 20:47.447
<i>you know, JPEGs, MPEGs,
MP3s, Zips, all that stuff.</i>

20:47.800 --> 20:51.691
<i>Uh, but we all know that,
so there's no point in talking about it.</i>

20:52.400 --> 20:54.243
<i>But, uh, what happened was,</i>

20:54.320 --> 20:58.530
<i>last night, um, I was watching my
friends here have this argument</i>

20:58.880 --> 21:02.327
<i>about, you know, uh, manipulating d...
Uh, data.</i>

21:03.000 --> 21:08.928
<i>And, you know, how many datas
could one guy manipulate at once and...</i>

21:11.320 --> 21:12.765
<i>And I was just... I was thinking.</i>

21:12.840 --> 21:14.560
<i>Uh, maybe it could be
another way, you know?</i>

21:14.640 --> 21:16.927
<i>Uh, something that I would
call, "middle-out."</i>

21:17.520 --> 21:21.605
<i>It's up-and-down, back-and-forth all
at the same time going on at once.</i>

21:22.840 --> 21:26.003
<i>Okay, well, anyway,
I deleted all our modules last night,</i>

21:26.080 --> 21:29.448
<i>and I completely rebuilt our engine,
from scratch last night.</i>

21:29.680 --> 21:34.641
<i>Um, now, this morning I really only
had enough time to do one test,</i>

21:34.720 --> 21:40.124
<i>and when I did,
we hit a Weissman score of 3.8.</i>

21:42.240 --> 21:45.801
<i>Now, I know the theoretical limit was 2.9,</i>

21:45.880 --> 21:51.842
<i>- but as you can see here...
- I'm sorry. You scored a 3.8?</i>

21:52.480 --> 21:53.925
<i>Uh, yes, sir.</i>

21:54.040 --> 21:56.168
<i>And this is a universal lossless
compression engine?</i>

21:56.240 --> 21:59.687
<i>- Text? Audio? Video?
- Yes, that is correct.</i>

21:59.920 --> 22:03.402
<i>Well, I'm sorry to interrupt
your eloquent presentation, Richard.</i>

22:03.800 --> 22:06.849
<i>But, rather than say anything more,
why don't we just give you a file</i>

22:06.920 --> 22:09.048
<i>and we'll see whether this thing
can do what you say it does.</i>

22:09.120 --> 22:12.886
<i>Because if it can't,
then we're done here, right?</i>

22:13.120 --> 22:14.645
<i>Yeah. Yeah, that's fair.</i>

22:14.760 --> 22:16.842
<i>So we can give you any kind of file
and you can compress it,</i>

22:16.920 --> 22:20.447
<i>without degradation, at this standard?
Three-eight?</i>

22:20.960 --> 22:23.008
<i>Yes... Yep.</i>

22:23.080 --> 22:24.605
<i>All right, give us a minute, please.</i>

22:26.280 --> 22:28.521
- What do we got?
- Does anyone have anything?

22:33.760 --> 22:35.760
- Do you have something?
- I've got a file for him.

22:36.040 --> 22:38.646
<i>Okay. Andy Stafford here,
has a file for you.</i>

22:38.880 --> 22:41.690
<i>- Okay.
- It's 132 gigabytes uncompressed,</i>

22:41.760 --> 22:43.444
<i>and it's a 3-D video file.</i>

22:47.320 --> 22:48.560
<i>Okay-</i>

22:50.560 --> 22:51.971
Shit...

22:52.040 --> 22:54.042
- A fucking 3-D file?
- Yes.

22:54.120 --> 22:56.930
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- God damn it.

22:57.880 --> 23:00.531
- Can we handle this?
- I guess we'll find out.

23:01.120 --> 23:02.849
Damn it, I hope this works.

23:12.640 --> 23:13.880
Shit, it's hung.

23:14.960 --> 23:16.610
Oh, no.

23:17.680 --> 23:19.250
<i>Is it stuck?</i>

23:19.320 --> 23:21.766
<i>There is a time limit,
you have two minutes remaining.</i>

23:23.200 --> 23:24.920
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on.

23:28.880 --> 23:30.120
<i>It looks like it's done.</i>

23:30.720 --> 23:32.882
Wait, 24 gigs? What happened?

23:32.960 --> 23:35.930
Oh, shit, there's no way.

23:36.280 --> 23:38.965
It didn't compress the whole thing.
It should be twice that size.

23:39.040 --> 23:42.567
<i>I mean, 24 gigs, that's less
than a fourth the file size.</i>

23:42.840 --> 23:44.569
<i>That seems dubious, Richard.</i>

23:44.840 --> 23:48.128
<i>Why don't we run a Weissman test
for verification, see where we went wrong.</i>

23:48.360 --> 23:51.601
<i>Okay, I mean it shouldn't take too long,
it only compressed half the fucking file.</i>

23:57.800 --> 23:59.848
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have rewritten all this code.

24:00.000 --> 24:01.764
I mean, what we had before worked.

24:02.000 --> 24:05.129
I'm sorry, guys. Gavin won. We lost.

24:05.240 --> 24:10.201
At least it didn't happen in a public
and brutally embarrassing way.

24:11.120 --> 24:13.168
- Thanks, Gilfoyle.
- Yeah.

24:17.360 --> 24:19.886
Wait a second. What's happening?

24:20.040 --> 24:22.566
There's no errors, look!

24:27.040 --> 24:29.771
- 5.2? How, how...
- Wait, what?

24:30.040 --> 24:32.247
- Wait, it compressed the whole file?
- Whoa!

24:32.720 --> 24:34.085
That's the whole file.

24:34.200 --> 24:36.771
It's just half the size
I thought it would be.

24:37.200 --> 24:40.921
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, obviously we're
going to keep looking at this to verify,</i>

24:41.160 --> 24:43.561
<i>but with a confirmed score of 5.2,</i>

24:43.640 --> 24:47.850
<i>Pied Piper appears to have just doubled
the best Weissman score ever measured.</i>

24:47.920 --> 24:48.967
<i>- Doubled it!</i>

24:49.040 --> 24:50.724
<i>Pied Piper, ladies and gentlemen!</i>

24:50.840 --> 24:52.649
<i>Let's hear it for them!</i>

24:54.240 --> 24:55.571
Holy shit!

24:56.160 --> 24:58.242
Hey, I'm at TechCrunch.

24:58.480 --> 25:01.324
This kid, Hendricks, and Pied Piper
just ran a two-minute mile.

25:01.400 --> 25:02.890
We should get on this, now.

25:03.400 --> 25:05.482
Suck it, Gavin Belson!

25:08.240 --> 25:09.561
Hendricks, you beautiful bastard!

25:09.600 --> 25:12.410
I told you we'd do it! Come on!

25:12.480 --> 25:14.323
We're not going to be poor!

25:14.520 --> 25:17.205
What happened? What happened?
What happened? What happened?

25:17.280 --> 25:18.884
Ah, we just won the cup!

25:20.120 --> 25:21.281
Whoo!

25:22.440 --> 25:26.729
<i>And I don't think it comes as any shock
that the winner of this year's Disrupt Cup</i>

25:26.800 --> 25:32.364
<i>and $50,000, like they're going to need it,
is Pied Piper.</i>

25:34.920 --> 25:36.410
So Richard wrote the code?

25:36.480 --> 25:40.326
Richard wrote the code, yes,
but the inspiration was clear.

25:40.760 --> 25:41.921
- Let me ask you something.
- Mmm-hmm.

25:42.000 --> 25:45.322
How fast do you think
you could jack off every guy in this room?

25:46.520 --> 25:48.121
'Cause I know how long it would take me.

25:48.800 --> 25:49.926
And I can prove it.

25:50.000 --> 25:51.570
- Nice.
- Thank you so much.

25:51.640 --> 25:54.086
I don't fully understand it
but I would definitely like to invest.

25:54.160 --> 25:55.650
- Oh, great.
- Really impressed.

25:55.720 --> 25:57.085
I really want to get you
in front of my partners.

25:57.200 --> 25:58.964
- Really soon.
- Oh, wow. I appreciate that, guys.

25:59.040 --> 26:01.088
Well, hopefully we'll
talk to each other soon.

26:01.160 --> 26:02.241
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

26:02.560 --> 26:04.403
- Hey!
- Monica!

26:04.480 --> 26:07.563
Congratulations! You were amazing up there.

26:07.640 --> 26:09.529
- Thank you.
- I just spoke with Peter.

26:09.600 --> 26:13.685
He watched the live-stream via satellite
and said he was "not unpleased."

26:13.840 --> 26:15.604
Oh, yeah, that's great.

26:16.160 --> 26:19.482
Uh, so I guess
we're back to working together, huh?

26:20.240 --> 26:22.720
Yeah. Yeah, I guess so.

26:25.800 --> 26:27.848
It's gonna get pretty
insane for you, Richard.

26:27.920 --> 26:30.127
- Yeah.
- You're going to have more offers of funding

26:30.200 --> 26:31.964
- than you're going to know what to do with.
- Yeah.

26:32.040 --> 26:33.530
You're going to have to grow a business,

26:33.600 --> 26:36.490
- hire a staff, rent offices, get an assistant.
- Mmm-hmm.

26:36.560 --> 26:39.530
Peter is going to be a lot more hands-on
and a lot tougher on you.

26:39.840 --> 26:42.969
People may take credit for your idea
and try and sue you.

26:43.080 --> 26:45.924
- How awesome is that?
- Ah, yeah, that's awesome.

26:46.040 --> 26:48.122
I mean, if you thought it was crazy
getting to this point,

26:48.200 --> 26:50.282
you're not going to believe
what it turns into from here.

26:50.360 --> 26:51.361
Right.

26:51.440 --> 26:53.442
I mean pretty soon, you could be
managing thousands of employees

26:53.520 --> 26:55.329
- who are all looking up to you.
- Mmm.

26:55.520 --> 26:58.126
And Gavin Belson,
he's not going away anytime soon.

26:58.200 --> 26:59.929
- Mmm.
- But it's going to be amazing.

27:01.200 --> 27:02.725
Excuse me a second.

27:13.520 --> 27:15.124
Oh, Jesus.
