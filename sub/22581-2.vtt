00:34.616 --> 00:36.718
You're looking for Klaang... 

00:36.718 --> 00:40.120
- why?
- Who the hell are you?

00:40.120 --> 00:42.923
My name is Sarin.

00:42.923 --> 00:46.526
Tell me about the people
who took Klaang off your ship.

00:46.526 --> 00:49.228
I was hoping you could tell me... 

00:49.228 --> 00:52.030
they looked a lot like 
your friends outside.

00:52.030 --> 00:54.232
Where were you taking him?

00:54.232 --> 00:56.434
How come you don't look 
like your friends?

00:56.434 --> 00:59.336
Would you prefer I did?

00:59.336 --> 01:02.138
What I'd prefer is that 
you give me Klaang back.

01:02.138 --> 01:04.739
So you could take him where?

01:04.739 --> 01:07.443
Home... 

01:07.443 --> 01:11.446
we were just taking him home.

01:12.647 --> 01:15.549
You'd better be careful.
I'm a lot bigger than you are.

01:15.549 --> 01:19.552
If you're thinking about harming me,
I'd advise against it.

01:22.255 --> 01:24.857
What are you doing?

01:24.857 --> 01:28.860
Why were you taking Klaang home?

01:29.861 --> 01:33.864
You know, under different circumstances,
I might be flattered by this, but...

01:46.274 --> 01:50.277
That's never happened before.

01:51.678 --> 01:55.682
I've been given the ability to... 
measure trust... but it requires
close contact.

01:56.282 --> 01:57.583
You're Suliban...

01:57.583 --> 02:01.586
I'm a member of the Cabal...
but not any longer. 

02:01.586 --> 02:04.489
The price of evolution was too high.

02:04.489 --> 02:06.090
Evolution?

02:06.090 --> 02:10.092
Some of my people are so anxious to "improve" 
themselves that they've lost perspective.

02:11.394 --> 02:14.897
So you know I'm not lying 
to you... now what?

02:14.897 --> 02:17.399
Klaang was carrying a 
message to his people...

02:17.399 --> 02:20.301
- How do you know that?
- I gave it to him.

02:20.301 --> 02:22.203
What kind of message?

02:22.203 --> 02:25.205
The Suliban have been staging attacks 
within the Klingon Empire... 

02:25.205 --> 02:28.308
making it appear that one 
faction is attacking another.

02:28.308 --> 02:31.511
Klaang was bringing proof of 
this to his High Council. 

02:31.511 --> 02:35.013
Without that proof, the Empire c
ould be thrown into chaos.

02:35.013 --> 02:37.215
Why would the Suliban want that?

02:37.215 --> 02:39.817
The Cabal doesn't make 
decisions on its own. 

02:39.817 --> 02:42.720
They're simply soldiers... 
fighting a Temporal Cold War.

02:42.720 --> 02:46.323
Temporal? You've lost me.

02:46.323 --> 02:49.625
They're taking orders from 
the distant future.

02:49.625 --> 02:51.026
What? 

02:51.026 --> 02:53.328
We can help you find Klaang...
but we don't have a starship. 

02:53.328 --> 02:57.331
You'll have to take us with you.

03:27.456 --> 03:28.757
Where's your vessel?

03:28.757 --> 03:30.558
On the roof... Docking Port three.

03:30.558 --> 03:34.562
This way.

04:11.591 --> 04:15.595
Find Klaang.

04:39.114 --> 04:41.015
Where's the pod?

04:41.015 --> 04:45.019
- Over here!
- No, it's this way!

04:45.219 --> 04:49.222
Come on!

04:50.623 --> 04:54.626
Lieutenant Reed, this is Archer!
Come in!

04:56.128 --> 05:00.131
We're on the roof! You need to 
get up here as quickly as --

05:02.533 --> 05:04.634
We've been trying to reach you, 
Captain --we're back in the shuttle.

05:04.634 --> 05:07.437
Ask him where they are.
This storm's getting worse.

05:07.437 --> 05:09.739
Captain, what's your location? 

05:09.739 --> 05:13.742
The weather is -

05:15.843 --> 05:19.847
- Great!
- Like I said, it's over there!

05:47.969 --> 05:50.572
I've never seen lightning 
in a snowstorm before.

05:50.572 --> 05:54.575
The storm's kicking up 
too much interference...

05:54.775 --> 05:57.077
I can't isolate 
human bio-signs. 

05:57.077 --> 05:59.179
They could be anywhere 
in the complex.

05:59.179 --> 06:03.182
Try Vulcan bio-signs

06:05.384 --> 06:09.387
I found her.

06:30.304 --> 06:34.307
Get to the ship --now!

06:49.819 --> 06:53.322
- Go!
- Enterprise needs its Captain!
  Give me the weapons!

06:53.322 --> 06:57.326
I said go!

07:29.952 --> 07:33.955
- The starboard thruster's down!
- Ignore it. Take us up.

07:43.163 --> 07:45.665
We need instructions.

07:45.665 --> 07:48.067
Open a channel.

07:48.067 --> 07:51.069
- Sub-Commander T'Pol to Enterprise.
- Go ahead.

07:51.069 --> 07:54.572
We'll be docking in four minutes.
Have Doctor Phlox meet us in Decon.

07:54.572 --> 07:57.274
Acknowledged. Is someone wounded?

07:57.274 --> 07:59.075
The Captain. 

07:59.075 --> 08:03.079
I'm taking command of Enterprise.

08:14.388 --> 08:15.489
I can't do it!

08:15.489 --> 08:17.891
Yes, you can. Take her up... 

08:17.891 --> 08:21.894
straight and steady.

08:27.799 --> 08:31.802
Damn

08:34.304 --> 08:38.307
You can't be afraid of the wind... 
learn to trust it.

08:46.914 --> 08:49.817
It shouldn't take more 
than a few moments.

08:49.817 --> 08:51.518
Is this really necessary?

08:51.518 --> 08:55.521
The others scanned negative. 
You two, unfortunately, were
exposed to a protocystian spore. 

08:55.921 --> 08:59.224
I've loaded the appropriate 
decon-gel into compartment-B.

08:59.224 --> 09:02.527
Tell Mister Mayweather to 
prepare to leave orbit.

09:02.527 --> 09:04.829
- How's the Captain?
- I'm treating his wound 

09:04.829 --> 09:08.832
- Will he be all right? 
- Eventually 

09:29.048 --> 09:31.750
Correct me if I'm wrong, 

09:31.750 --> 09:34.353
but aren't you just kind of 
an "observer" on this mission 

09:34.353 --> 09:38.356
I don't remember anyone telling me 
you were a member of Starfleet.

09:38.656 --> 09:40.858
My Vulcan rank supersedes yours.

09:40.858 --> 09:44.861
Apples and oranges. This is an Earth vessel. 
You're in no position to take command.

09:45.462 --> 09:48.664
As soon as we're through here, 
I'll contact Ambassador Soval. 

09:48.664 --> 09:52.667
Él hablará con tus superiores,
y estoy segura que reafirmarán mi autoridad

09:56.871 --> 10:00.374
He'll speak to your superiors 
and I'm certain they'll support 
my authority in this situation.

10:00.374 --> 10:04.377
You must really be proud of yourself.
You can put an end to this mission while 
the Captain's still unconscious in Sickbay. 

10:04.877 --> 10:08.180
You won't even have to 
look him in the eye.

10:08.180 --> 10:12.183
Your precious "cargo" was stolen...
3 Suliban, perhaps more, were killed... 

10:12.884 --> 10:15.686
and Captain Archer has been 
seriously wounded. 

10:15.686 --> 10:19.689
It seems to me this "mission" 
has put an end to itself.

10:19.689 --> 10:23.692
Turn around.

10:25.994 --> 10:27.996
Let's say you're right... 

10:27.996 --> 10:30.898
let's say we screwed up just 
like you always knew we would.

10:30.898 --> 10:34.902
It's still a pretty good bet that 
whoever blew that hole in the Captain's 
leg is connected somehow to the people
who took Klaang.

10:36.803 --> 10:39.505
I fail to see your point.

10:39.505 --> 10:42.308
Captain Archer deserves a chance to 
see this through. If you knew him, 

10:42.308 --> 10:46.311
you'd realize that's what 
he's about. He needs to 
finish what he starts.

10:47.211 --> 10:49.914
His daddy was the same way.

10:49.914 --> 10:52.716
You obviously share your Captain's 
belief that my people were responsible 

10:52.716 --> 10:55.919
for impeding Henry Archer's 
accomplishments.

10:55.919 --> 10:59.922
He only wanted to see his engine fly...

11:00.222 --> 11:03.124
they never even gave 
him a chance to fail. 

11:03.124 --> 11:07.128
And here you are, 32 later,
proving just how consistent 
you Vulcans can be.

11:26.944 --> 11:29.446
Very nice, very nice... 

11:29.446 --> 11:32.748
your myofibers are fusing beautifully.

11:32.748 --> 11:35.150
- How long have I been...?
- Less than six hours. 

11:35.150 --> 11:39.153
I thought it best to keep you 
sedated while the osmotic eel 
cauterized your wound.

11:40.455 --> 11:44.258
Thanks.

11:44.258 --> 11:47.760
- How are you doing, Captain?
- That depends.

11:47.760 --> 11:49.862
What's been going on for 
the last six hours?

11:49.862 --> 11:53.865
As your highest ranking officer, 
I assumed command while you were 
incapacitated.

11:54.566 --> 11:58.469
Are we underway?

11:58.469 --> 12:00.871
You didn't waste much time, did you?

12:00.871 --> 12:02.472
Is he fit to resume command?

12:02.472 --> 12:06.075
As long as he returns for 
more eel therapy tomorrow.

12:06.075 --> 12:08.177
How long before we get back to
Earth?

12:08.177 --> 12:09.078
Earth, sir?

12:09.078 --> 12:11.179
We're currently tracking 
the Suliban vessel 

12:11.179 --> 12:15.183
that left Rigel shortly 
after you were injured.

12:16.584 --> 12:20.487
You got their... plasma decay rate?

12:20.487 --> 12:23.689
With Mister Tucker's assistance,
I modified the sensors. 

12:23.689 --> 12:27.693
You now have the resolution 
to detect their warp trail.

12:28.493 --> 12:31.095
What happened to "this is a foolish mission?"

12:31.095 --> 12:33.297
It is a foolish mission. 

12:33.297 --> 12:37.301
The Suliban are clearly a hostile race 
with technology far superior to yours.

12:38.401 --> 12:42.204
But as Acting Captain,
I was obligated to 
anticipate your wishes.

12:42.204 --> 12:46.208
As Acting Captain, you could've done 
whatever the hell you wanted to do.

12:46.808 --> 12:50.711
I should return to the Bridge.

12:50.711 --> 12:54.715
Dismissed.

12:55.615 --> 12:58.618
Modifying the sensors 

12:58.618 --> 13:02.621
was her idea, sir.

13:05.223 --> 13:09.226
Enterprise Starlog, Captain Jonathan Archer, April 16th, 2151

13:10.928 --> 13:13.730
We've been tracking the 
Suliban's ship for ten hours, 

13:13.730 --> 13:17.733
thanks to our... Science Officer, 
who came up with a way to tweak the sensors.

13:20.035 --> 13:22.637
Computer, pause.

13:22.637 --> 13:25.740
I save her life, and now she's 
helping us with the mission. 

13:25.740 --> 13:27.741
"One good turn deserves another" ... 

13:27.741 --> 13:30.844
doesn't sound very Vulcan.

13:30.844 --> 13:34.747
Resume log.

13:34.747 --> 13:37.149
I have no reason to believe 
Klaang is still alive...

13:37.149 --> 13:40.652
but if the Suliban woman 
was telling the truth, 

13:40.652 --> 13:43.854
it's crucial that we 
try to find him.

13:43.854 --> 13:45.255
Computer, pause.

13:45.255 --> 13:49.259
Have you ever known a 
Vulcan to return a favor?

13:49.259 --> 13:53.262
No, neither have I. 

13:53.362 --> 13:55.364
Resume log.

13:55.364 --> 13:59.367
I still haven't decided whether 
to ask Sub-Commander T'Pol about 
this "Temporal Cold War." 

14:01.969 --> 14:05.972
My instincts tell me 
not to trust her.

14:06.673 --> 14:09.175
Computer, pause.

14:09.175 --> 14:13.178
- Archer to T'Pol. Report.
- If you're feeling well enough to come to the Bridge, 

14:13.979 --> 14:17.982
now would be a good time.

14:26.088 --> 14:28.290
It's a gas giant.

14:28.290 --> 14:31.693
From the looks of it, a Class 6 or 7.

14:31.693 --> 14:33.294
Class Seven.

14:33.294 --> 14:36.697
The Suliban vessel dropped 
to impulse a few hours ago 
and altered course. 

14:36.697 --> 14:40.300
Their new heading took them through 
its outer- radiation belt.

14:40.300 --> 14:41.701
We've lost them?

14:41.701 --> 14:45.604
Yes.

14:45.604 --> 14:49.608
Move us in closer.

14:54.812 --> 14:56.613
Anything?

14:56.613 --> 15:00.616
The radiation's dissipated 
their warp trail. I'm only 
picking up fragments.

15:01.717 --> 15:05.721
You finished helping us?

15:09.223 --> 15:13.227
Run a spectral analysis 
of the fragments.

15:15.629 --> 15:19.632
There's too much distortion... 
the decay rates don't even match.

15:24.436 --> 15:27.838
Calculate the trajectory of each
fragment.

15:27.838 --> 15:31.842
- Sir?
- You heard her.

15:31.942 --> 15:35.945
Recalibrate the sensor array --
narrow-band, short-to-mid-range.

15:37.746 --> 15:41.750
Measure the particle density 
of the thermosphere.

15:43.651 --> 15:45.253
[...]

15:45.253 --> 15:47.955
Those "fragments" weren't from one Suliban ship...

15:47.955 --> 15:49.356
...they were from 14... 

15:49.356 --> 15:53.359
and all within the last six hours.
I believe we've found what we're looking for.

15:56.061 --> 15:58.163
How are your targeting scanners?

15:58.163 --> 16:02.166
Aligned and ready, sir.

16:04.068 --> 16:06.370
Bring the weapons on-line... 

16:06.370 --> 16:07.571
and polarize the hull plating.

16:07.571 --> 16:10.473
Lay in a sixty degree vector. 

16:10.473 --> 16:11.476
Vamos a entrar

16:13.676 --> 16:18.379
- Did Sarin give them anything?
- I don't know.
- What do you know?

16:18.379 --> 16:22.383
- They followed us here.
- Looking for Klaang, or for you?

16:22.583 --> 16:26.586
I don't know... but I'll destroy 
them before they locate the Helix.

16:27.687 --> 16:31.490
We didn't plan to involve the 
humans or the Vulcans... 

16:31.490 --> 16:33.792
not yet .

16:33.792 --> 16:37.094
Sarin's message cannot reach Kronos. 

16:37.094 --> 16:41.098
If the humans have it, you must stop them.

16:48.304 --> 16:51.106
Sensor resolution's falling 
off at about 12 kilometers...

16:51.106 --> 16:52.407
Travis?

16:52.407 --> 16:53.908
I'm okay, Captain...

16:53.908 --> 16:57.911
Our situation should improve. 
We're about to break through 
the cyclohexane layer.

17:00.413 --> 17:04.416
I wouldn't exactly call this an improvement.

17:04.517 --> 17:05.718
Liquid phosphorous.

17:05.718 --> 17:09.721
I wouldn't have expected that 
beneath a layer of cyclohexane.

17:10.421 --> 17:13.223
You might think about recommending 
seat belts when we get home.

17:13.223 --> 17:17.227
It's just a little bad weather.

17:18.528 --> 17:21.030
We've got sensors!

17:21.030 --> 17:24.633
Leveloff.
Go to long-range scans.

17:24.633 --> 17:28.636
I'm detecting 2 vessels... 
bearing 1-1-1 mark 9.

17:28.636 --> 17:32.639
Put it up.

17:34.341 --> 17:35.842
Impulse and warp engines.

17:35.842 --> 17:38.144
- What kind of weapons?
- We're too far away.

17:38.144 --> 17:42.147
Sir, I'm picking up something 
at 3-4-2 mark 12... 

17:42.948 --> 17:46.951
it's a lot bigger.

17:49.753 --> 17:53.756
All sensors --get whatever you can!

17:57.059 --> 18:01.062
Go tighter.

18:01.763 --> 18:05.766
- Bio-signs?
- Over 3000... but I can't isolate 
  a Klingon, if there is one.

18:08.669 --> 18:11.371
That was a particle weapon, sir.

18:11.371 --> 18:14.173
Bridge, we're taking damage 
down here! What's going on?

18:14.173 --> 18:16.475
Just a little trouble 
with the bad guys.

18:16.475 --> 18:20.478
I suggest we return to 
the phosphorous layer.

18:20.978 --> 18:24.982
Take us up.

18:31.786 --> 18:33.689
Captain.

18:33.689 --> 18:34.990
What've you got?

18:34.990 --> 18:38.593
It appears to be an aggregate structure... 
comprised of 100 of vessels. 

18:38.593 --> 18:42.496
They're held in place by an interlocking 
system of magnetic seals.

18:42.496 --> 18:46.499
There, right there! 

18:48.200 --> 18:50.703
These bio-readings 
are not Suliban.

18:50.703 --> 18:52.704
We can't be certain 
they're Klingon.

18:52.704 --> 18:56.607
Even if it Klaang, we'd have a tough 
time getting him off of there...

18:56.607 --> 18:59.510
We could always try the transporting device...

18:59.510 --> 19:03.113
No. We've risked too much 
to bring him back inside-out.

19:03.113 --> 19:06.315
Would the grappler work 
in a liquid atmosphere?

19:06.315 --> 19:08.017
I believe so...

19:08.017 --> 19:10.218
Bring it on-line.

19:10.218 --> 19:14.222
One more time, Mister Mayweather 

19:26.832 --> 19:28.333
The ventral plating's down!

19:28.333 --> 19:29.734
Hold your position...

19:29.734 --> 19:31.435
The lead ship's closing... 

19:31.435 --> 19:34.238
7000 meters...

19:34.238 --> 19:37.240
six thousand...

19:37.240 --> 19:41.243
- We should ascend!
- Hold your position!

19:41.744 --> 19:45.747
1000 meters...

19:45.747 --> 19:49.750
Forward plating's off-line!

19:50.851 --> 19:54.854
Now, Mister Reed!

20:08.265 --> 20:11.868
Their ship's in the Launch Bay.

20:11.868 --> 20:13.770
[...]

20:13.770 --> 20:16.472
All right, what's this?

20:16.472 --> 20:17.973
The pitch control.

20:17.973 --> 20:20.275
No, that's the pitch control. 

20:20.275 --> 20:22.377
This is the guidance system.

20:22.377 --> 20:26.380
Pitch control... guidance system...
got it.

20:27.481 --> 20:28.882
The docking interface.

20:28.882 --> 20:30.083
How do you deploy it?

20:30.083 --> 20:32.785
Release the inertial clamps here,
here, and here... 

20:32.785 --> 20:35.187
then initialize the 
coaxial ports.

20:35.187 --> 20:39.190
Bien.. dónde está el
eyector auxiliar.

20:40.892 --> 20:44.895
Hmm. It's not this one...

20:45.095 --> 20:48.598
With all due respect to Commander Tucker... 
I'm pretty sure I could fly this thing, sir.

20:48.598 --> 20:50.599
I don't doubt it, but I need you here...

20:50.599 --> 20:54.603
There... that's it... the auxiliary throttle.

20:59.006 --> 21:02.509
Captain. That charge contained 
a proximity sweep. 

21:02.509 --> 21:04.911
If we remain here, 
they're going to locate us.

21:04.911 --> 21:06.713
You're gonna have to speed 
this up a little, Travis.

21:06.713 --> 21:10.716
How complicated can it be? 
Up, down, forward, reverse... 

21:10.816 --> 21:13.819
we'll figure it out.

21:16.120 --> 21:17.822
We'll be back before you know it. 

21:17.822 --> 21:21.825
Have Mayweather plot a course for Kronos.

21:24.427 --> 21:26.128
There's a Vulcan ship less 
than 2 days away. 

21:26.128 --> 21:28.730
It's illogical to attempt this alone.

21:28.730 --> 21:31.833
I was beginning to think you 
understood why we have to do 
this alone.

21:31.833 --> 21:35.136
You'll have other opportunities to 
demonstrate your... independence.

21:35.136 --> 21:36.737
Never put off 'til tomorrow...

21:36.737 --> 21:38.138
You both could be killed.

21:38.138 --> 21:40.140
Am I sensing concern? 

21:40.140 --> 21:42.542
Last time I checked, that 
was considered an emotion.

21:42.542 --> 21:46.545
If anything happens to either of you, 
the Vulcan High Command will hold me 
responsible.

21:46.745 --> 21:48.847
Come in.

21:48.847 --> 21:52.850
- You're finished?
- Yes.

21:54.551 --> 21:58.054
It should reverse the polarity of 
any maglock within a hundred meters.

21:58.054 --> 22:00.256
Once you've set the sequence, 
you'll have 5 seconds.

22:00.256 --> 22:04.159
One more thing.

22:04.159 --> 22:06.661
Ah. Our new weapons.

22:06.661 --> 22:08.462
They're called phase-pistols. 

22:08.462 --> 22:11.065
They have 2 settings: stun and kill. 

22:11.065 --> 22:15.068
It would be best not to confuse them.

22:15.668 --> 22:19.672
[...]

22:19.972 --> 22:23.975
The ship is yours.

22:32.482 --> 22:33.883
What's that?

22:33.883 --> 22:37.086
Travis said not to worry 
about that panel.

22:37.086 --> 22:41.089
That's reassuring 

22:43.090 --> 22:45.793
Hold on.

22:45.793 --> 22:47.294
That one was a lot closer...

22:47.294 --> 22:50.096
If we change our position, 
they'll have to start from scratch.

22:50.096 --> 22:54.099
If we change our position, 
the Captain will have no 
way of finding us.

22:56.902 --> 22:58.703
I think we're there.

22:58.703 --> 23:02.706
Bring the docking interface on-line.

23:09.412 --> 23:13.415
Coaxial ports.

23:14.816 --> 23:16.417
Open.

23:16.417 --> 23:20.421
Let's go.

23:21.722 --> 23:25.225
Where is it? 
It was right here.

23:25.225 --> 23:29.228
Bank starboard, 90 degrees.

23:32.330 --> 23:36.133
There you are!

23:36.133 --> 23:38.535
That's the upper-support radius. 

23:38.535 --> 23:40.737
Drop down right below it... 

23:40.737 --> 23:44.740
and start a counter-clockwise sweep.

23:51.045 --> 23:54.949
A little more... 

23:54.949 --> 23:58.952
more...

24:05.457 --> 24:09.460
Right here.

24:49.593 --> 24:53.596
Stun seems to work.

24:54.797 --> 24:58.800
Grab on to something --

25:05.906 --> 25:07.207
This is ridiculous! 

25:07.207 --> 25:11.210
If we don't move the ship, 
Captain Archer won't have
anything to look for when
he gets back.

25:11.611 --> 25:13.312
We're going to need 
that ear of yours.

25:13.312 --> 25:14.813
Move us away, 5 kilometers.

25:14.813 --> 25:18.816
- In what direction?
- In what direction?

25:24.221 --> 25:26.723
This is gonna be easier 
than I thought.

25:26.723 --> 25:28.024
It's okay. 

25:28.024 --> 25:32.027
We're getting you off this thing 

25:36.130 --> 25:40.134
I really don't want to have 
to carry you out of here.

25:42.235 --> 25:46.239
You're OK?

25:47.339 --> 25:51.343
I think he gets the idea. 
Give him a hand.

26:08.955 --> 26:10.959
Be quiet.

26:16.663 --> 26:19.866
You tell him, big guy.

26:19.866 --> 26:23.869
Give me the box.

26:32.376 --> 26:36.379
Thanks.

26:40.783 --> 26:44.786
Get to the ship. I'll 
be right behind you.

27:20.915 --> 27:24.218
Captain?

27:24.218 --> 27:26.119
Where are you?

27:26.119 --> 27:28.321
I'm still on the central core. 
Get Klaang back to Enterprise.

27:28.321 --> 27:31.824
- What about you, sir?
- Get him to the ship. You
  can come back for me.

27:31.824 --> 27:33.625
It's going to be hard to 
isolate your bio-signs... 

27:33.625 --> 27:35.927
so stay as far away from 
the Suliban as you can.

27:35.927 --> 27:39.931
Believe me, I'll try.

27:52.841 --> 27:56.844
I don't particularly like the 
way you smell, either.

27:56.944 --> 28:00.847
I don't get it, this is right where they're supposed to be...

28:00.847 --> 28:02.749
The charges are getting 
closer again...

28:02.749 --> 28:05.051
Another 5 kilometers, Lieutenant.

28:05.051 --> 28:07.353
At this rate, the Captain'll 
never find us.

28:07.353 --> 28:09.054
Wait a minute... I think 
I've got something...

28:09.054 --> 28:13.057
Amplify it.

28:19.663 --> 28:22.265
It's Commander Tucker 

28:22.265 --> 28:26.268
All I hear is noise 

28:26.368 --> 28:30.371
Sshh... listen... it's just a 
narrow notch in the mid-range...

28:31.973 --> 28:35.976
He says he's about to ignite 
his thruster exhaust...

28:40.079 --> 28:43.782
Coordinates: 1-58 mark 1-3.

28:43.782 --> 28:47.785
- Laid in.
- Ahead, 50 KPH 

28:52.292 --> 28:56.492
- Esparan.
- You're welcome.

28:56.492 --> 28:58.394
Two kilometers, dead ahead.

28:58.394 --> 29:00.796
Initiate docking procedures.

29:00.796 --> 29:03.798
I'm only picking up two bio-signs.

29:03.798 --> 29:07.802
One Klingon... one human.

30:36.073 --> 30:38.575
[...]

30:38.575 --> 30:41.978
Our mission is to return the 
Klingon to his homeworld. 

30:41.978 --> 30:45.180
Another rescue attempt could 
jeopardize that mission.

30:45.180 --> 30:47.883
The Captain specifically told 
us to come back for him.

30:47.883 --> 30:51.485
As Commanding Officer, it's my job 
to interpret the Captain's orders... 

30:51.485 --> 30:54.488
I just told you his orders! 
What's there to interpret?

30:54.488 --> 30:57.090
Captain Archer may very well have 
told you to return for him later 

30:57.090 --> 30:59.192
because he knew how 
stubborn you can be.

30:59.192 --> 31:00.993
What the hell is that 
supposed to mean?

31:00.993 --> 31:04.996
You might've risked Klaang's life 
in a foolish attempt to swing back 
and rescue the Captain. 

31:05.197 --> 31:08.900
I can't believe this!

31:08.900 --> 31:11.902
The situation must be analyzed logically.

31:11.902 --> 31:15.905
I don't remember the Captain 
"analyzing" anything when he 
went back for you on that roof.

31:16.906 --> 31:19.908
That's a specious analogy.

31:19.908 --> 31:23.912
Is it?

31:34.120 --> 31:38.123
You're wasting your time.
Klanng knows nothing.

31:40.225 --> 31:44.228
It would be unwise to discharge 
that weapon in this room.

31:44.528 --> 31:46.730
What is this room? 

31:46.730 --> 31:48.832
What goes on in here?

31:48.832 --> 31:52.835
You're very curious, John. May I call you John?

31:53.636 --> 31:56.938
Am I supposed to be impressed 
that you know my name?

31:56.938 --> 31:59.541
I've learned a great 
deal about you... 

31:59.541 --> 32:02.143
even more than you know.

32:02.143 --> 32:06.146
Well, I guess you have me at a disadvantage.

32:06.246 --> 32:10.249
So why don't you drop the invisible man routine and

32:12.051 --> 32:14.853
let me see who I'm talking to?

32:14.853 --> 32:16.654
Hull plating's been re-polarized.

32:16.654 --> 32:20.658
Stand by impulse engines.
Mister Tucker, status?

32:20.858 --> 32:24.861
The auto-sequencer's on-line... 
but annular confinement's still 
off by 2 microns.

32:25.662 --> 32:28.064
- That should suffice.
- Easy for you to say.

32:28.064 --> 32:32.067
If the Suliban have re-established their 
defenses, we'll have no other option.

32:32.467 --> 32:36.470
You wouldn't have come looking 
for Klaang if Sarin had told 
you what she knew.

32:36.771 --> 32:39.373
That means you're no threat to me, John...

32:39.373 --> 32:43.376
but I need you to leave 
this room... Now.

32:48.680 --> 32:52.684
This chameleon thing... pretty fancy.

32:54.685 --> 32:58.688
Was it payment for pitting the 
Klingons against each other? 

32:59.789 --> 33:03.792
A trophy from your 
Temporal Cold War?

33:13.000 --> 33:17.003
- I was going to let you go.
- Really? 

33:17.203 --> 33:20.606
Then you obviously don't know as much 
about me as you thought you did.

33:20.606 --> 33:24.609
On the contrary. I could've told you 
what day you were going to die... 

33:25.210 --> 33:29.213
but I suppose that's about to change.

33:46.727 --> 33:50.730
What's the matter? No genetic tricks to 
keep you from getting knocked on your butt?

33:51.031 --> 33:54.233
What you call "tricks" we call progress.

33:54.233 --> 33:58.237
Are you aware that your genome is 
almost identical to that of an ape? 

33:59.638 --> 34:03.641
The Suliban don't share humanity's 
patience with natural selection.

34:05.643 --> 34:08.445
So to speed things up a little,
you struck a deal with the devil?

34:38.069 --> 34:40.471
We have four more coming up 
off starboard!

34:40.471 --> 34:43.072
Can we dock, ensign?

34:43.072 --> 34:46.175
These aren't ideal conditions!

34:46.175 --> 34:50.179
Mister Tucker... 
we're going to Plan B.

35:11.396 --> 35:15.399
Now

35:19.803 --> 35:23.205
Bridge, we've got him!

35:23.205 --> 35:27.208
Sorry, Captain. We 
had no other choice.

36:26.356 --> 36:30.360
Something about disgracing the Empire... 
he says he's ready to die.

37:48.022 --> 37:51.125
I'll take that as a thank you.

37:51.125 --> 37:55.128
I don't think they have 
a word for thank you.

37:55.428 --> 37:59.432
- What'd he say?
- You don't want to know.

38:05.436 --> 38:09.240
Come in.

38:09.240 --> 38:13.243
I've just gotten a response to the 
message I sent to Admiral Forrest. 

38:14.644 --> 38:18.647
He enjoyed telling the Vulcan High 
Command about the Suliban we ran into.

38:20.148 --> 38:24.152
It's not every day he gets to 
be the one dispensing information.

38:25.052 --> 38:29.056
I wanted you both to hear Starfleet's 
orders before I inform the crew.

38:29.856 --> 38:33.859
- Orders?
- Your people are sending a
  transport to pick you up.

38:34.560 --> 38:38.563
I was under the impression that 
Enterprise would be taking me 
back to "Earth.

38:38.763 --> 38:41.866
It would be a little 
out of our way.

38:41.866 --> 38:45.869
Admiral Forrest sees no reason 
why we shouldn't keep going.

38:46.370 --> 38:48.471
Son of a bitch!

38:48.471 --> 38:52.374
I have a feeling Doctor Phlox won't 
mind staying around for a while. 

38:52.374 --> 38:55.977
He's developing a fondness for 
the human endocrine system.

38:55.977 --> 38:58.780
I'll get double shifts 
on the repair work.

38:58.780 --> 39:01.482
I think the outer-hull's going 
to need a little patching up. 

39:01.482 --> 39:04.384
Let's hope that's the last time 
somebody takes a shot at us 

39:04.384 --> 39:06.486
Let's hope

39:06.486 --> 39:10.489
T'Pol... would you stick 
around for a minute?

39:12.891 --> 39:16.894
Ever since I can remember, I've 
seen Vulcans as an obstacle... 

39:19.096 --> 39:22.899
always keeping us from 
standing on our own two feet.

39:22.899 --> 39:26.902
- I understand.
- No, I don't think you do.

39:28.604 --> 39:32.607
If I'm going to pull this off, 
there are a few things I have 
to leave behind. 

39:33.608 --> 39:37.611
Things like preconceptions. 
holding grudges... mistrust...

39:42.215 --> 39:46.218
- This omission would've 
  failed without your help.
- I won't dispute that 

39:49.621 --> 39:53.624
I was thinking a Vulcan Science Officer could come in handy,

39:56.026 --> 39:59.229
but if I asked you to stay,

39:59.229 --> 40:01.130
it might look like I wasn't 
ready to do this on my own.

40:01.130 --> 40:05.133
- Perhaps you should add pride to your list.
- Perhaps I should.

40:08.036 --> 40:12.039
It might be best if I were to contact 
my superiors and make the request myself... 

40:14.341 --> 40:18.344
- with your permission.
- Permission granted.

40:31.755 --> 40:35.758
I hope nobody's in a 
big hurry to get home.

40:36.659 --> 40:40.662
Starfleet seems to think we're 
ready to begin our mission.

40:42.964 --> 40:46.967
I understand there's an inhabited 
planet a few light years from here.

40:47.468 --> 40:51.471
Sensors show a nitrogen-sulfide atmosphere.

40:51.571 --> 40:53.572
Probably not humanoids

40:53.572 --> 40:55.774
That's what we're here to find out.
