A NETFLIX SERIES

01:10.791 --> 01:12.250
What are you looking for?

01:14.041 --> 01:17.000
-What are you looking for?
-Dad's embalming equipment.

01:17.083 --> 01:19.291
It probably hasn't been used
for two decades,

01:19.375 --> 01:21.750
but it's supposed to be here somewhere.

01:21.833 --> 01:22.666
Why?

01:23.708 --> 01:24.708
Bingo.

01:26.125 --> 01:29.750
Embalming is basically
replacing blood with chemicals.

01:30.250 --> 01:32.875
We're not putting chemicals in,
just removing the blood.

01:37.541 --> 01:40.750
You saw what happened to you
when you didn't get blood.

01:41.875 --> 01:42.875
Yeah.

01:45.458 --> 01:48.208
We'll drain the blood,
then we'll have a small supply.

01:48.750 --> 01:50.708
Then we won't have to continue…

01:54.541 --> 01:55.791
And then what?

01:56.666 --> 01:57.708
Then we burn him.

01:58.833 --> 02:00.250
The way he tried to burn us.

HALLANGEN CASE

02:34.500 --> 02:35.333
Bingo.

02:46.625 --> 02:49.333
-There's nothing wrong, right?
-What threatens Hallangen Funeral--

02:49.416 --> 02:51.708
You're bankrupt.
I can't do anything about that.

02:53.041 --> 02:55.791
If you manage to pay off 30,000 kroner…

02:55.875 --> 02:57.250
You didn't really think

02:57.333 --> 03:00.541
you'd make 30,000
transporting an ordinary body, did you?

03:00.625 --> 03:01.916
Thirty thousand, Odd.

03:03.416 --> 03:05.541
What are you afraid of?

03:05.625 --> 03:07.375
It can't be that bad.

03:27.375 --> 03:28.416
Come on!

03:28.500 --> 03:29.500
I'm trying.

03:36.958 --> 03:37.833
Come on.

03:58.666 --> 04:00.708
OVERDUE

04:05.041 --> 04:06.458
Why the police car?

04:06.541 --> 04:09.458
Because no one will suspect the police
of having a body in the trunk.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.166
Where are you going?

04:11.250 --> 04:13.083
I forgot the key to the crematorium.

04:25.791 --> 04:26.666
Hello.

04:28.166 --> 04:29.125
What are you doing?

04:31.083 --> 04:31.958
Nothing.

04:33.416 --> 04:34.500
What are you doing?

04:35.500 --> 04:36.500
Nothing.

04:43.916 --> 04:44.750
Well, I…

04:46.291 --> 04:47.625
I don't know what to do.

04:55.208 --> 04:56.458
The bank is taking the house.

04:57.708 --> 04:58.583
What?

04:59.125 --> 05:00.125
Tomorrow.

05:01.875 --> 05:02.750
But…

05:04.291 --> 05:06.541
What about that trip to Sweden?

05:08.958 --> 05:10.625
I guess it was too good to be true.

05:11.375 --> 05:13.500
My conscience wouldn't let me do it.

05:33.250 --> 05:34.250
-Hello.
-Hi.

05:34.333 --> 05:35.750
-Hi.
-Early start?

05:35.833 --> 05:37.666
Yeah, of course.

05:38.291 --> 05:42.000
Should we go get
some proper coffee at the gas station?

05:42.083 --> 05:43.375
We're going to need it today.

05:43.458 --> 05:45.458
-I can get it.
-No, we'll go together.

05:45.541 --> 05:47.333
-What do you want?
-We'll go together.

05:47.416 --> 05:50.041
Judith? It's no problem for me to get it.

05:57.041 --> 05:58.875
Hey, Arvid's case.

06:01.208 --> 06:03.416
I'm so close. I'm this close now.

06:03.958 --> 06:04.958
This close.

06:12.833 --> 06:14.333
What's that smell?

06:22.375 --> 06:25.416
-Judith…
-God, that was a ripe one, Reinert.

06:28.500 --> 06:29.916
We'll go later.

06:33.583 --> 06:34.625
By the way,

06:34.708 --> 06:37.208
double cappuccino, two sweeteners. Bye.

06:41.416 --> 06:42.625
What am I going to tell Rose?

06:43.875 --> 06:45.666
You have to tell her the truth.

06:46.625 --> 06:49.291
That we're moving tomorrow,
and I've been lying for weeks?

06:49.375 --> 06:51.083
But you weren't lying.

06:51.625 --> 06:53.541
Avoided the truth. It's the same thing.

06:53.625 --> 06:56.416
You did what you thought was best
to save the family business.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.833
But it's not about the business.
It's all about family.

07:00.625 --> 07:02.666
No one dies in Skarnes.

07:03.208 --> 07:06.250
There's obviously not a market here
for living off people's deaths.

07:08.250 --> 07:10.166
What if you could get the money?

07:10.750 --> 07:12.750
Yeah, but then I'd need a real funeral.

07:14.750 --> 07:17.458
Not a fucking miser's funeral,
like Gundersen's.

07:18.375 --> 07:19.291
A proper one.

07:22.541 --> 07:24.375
Remember what Dad used to say?

07:27.208 --> 07:28.291
It'll turn around.

07:30.791 --> 07:32.083
But it didn't for him.

07:33.375 --> 07:35.666
Rose worked late last night, didn't she?

07:36.208 --> 07:37.083
Yeah.

07:38.708 --> 07:41.166
At least wait until she wakes up
before you talk to her?

07:42.666 --> 07:43.541
Yeah.

07:48.916 --> 07:50.291
Okay, new plan.

07:50.958 --> 07:54.083
Sverre is already dead,
and we need to get away with it.

07:54.166 --> 07:57.583
But we also have the opportunity
to give Odd a funeral.

08:00.875 --> 08:02.541
No.

08:03.041 --> 08:04.166
I can help him now.

08:04.916 --> 08:06.125
We can help him now.

08:06.208 --> 08:08.541
Yeah, but they'll find
something suspicious, Live.

08:08.625 --> 08:11.041
Who are "they"? The ER doctor is lying…

08:11.916 --> 08:14.791
He's lying in the trunk.
And the police are behind the wheel.

09:06.541 --> 09:07.583
There you are!

09:08.708 --> 09:10.916
-Here he is.
-There you are.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.041
Where did you go?

09:12.125 --> 09:13.916
Did you have to go
to Kongsvinger for coffee?

09:14.000 --> 09:15.083
Come in here.

09:18.458 --> 09:19.291
Thank you.

09:20.583 --> 09:21.416
Look at this.

09:24.000 --> 09:27.250
This is an unsolved murder from 1993.

09:28.666 --> 09:30.500
I suspected Live's mother.

09:31.916 --> 09:35.791
I fucked up that time.
I should have listened to my intuition.

09:37.833 --> 09:39.541
What's your intuition saying now?

09:39.625 --> 09:41.875
Everything points to Live.

09:43.291 --> 09:45.250
There's something she's not telling us.

09:45.333 --> 09:46.333
Do you have proof?

09:46.875 --> 09:48.375
Yeah, I have proof.

09:48.916 --> 09:51.166
But not proof with a capital "P," no.

09:54.333 --> 09:55.333
Yet.

09:57.583 --> 10:00.833
I'm sorry I didn't
listen to you after you…

10:03.125 --> 10:05.708
Skarnes police station, Marianne speaking.

10:06.541 --> 10:07.375
Judith?

10:07.458 --> 10:08.375
Yeah?

10:08.458 --> 10:10.333
-Phone.
-Tell them to call back later.

10:10.416 --> 10:11.666
You should really take this.

10:12.750 --> 10:13.583
Take it.

10:17.666 --> 10:18.500
Hello.

10:21.666 --> 10:22.500
Yes.

10:24.708 --> 10:25.875
Right.

10:25.958 --> 10:26.791
Yeah.

10:27.541 --> 10:28.875
Yeah, thanks.

10:29.958 --> 10:30.875
Reinert.

10:31.541 --> 10:32.416
The doctor is dead.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.875
-What?
-Sverre Hansen was found dead in his home.

10:36.458 --> 10:37.541
Oh my God.

10:38.208 --> 10:40.791
Something very scary is going on.

10:40.875 --> 10:42.000
I'll deal with it.

10:42.083 --> 10:43.375
-You're sure?
-Yeah.

10:43.458 --> 10:45.666
Then I'll continue the investigation here.

10:56.375 --> 10:57.666
-Odd.
-I'm sorry.

10:58.791 --> 10:59.791
I'm sorry.

11:01.250 --> 11:02.625
Hallangen, Odd speaking.

11:04.750 --> 11:07.041
No, I can make it in half an hour.
No problem.

11:07.125 --> 11:09.041
Odd, I was working until 2:00 last night.

11:09.125 --> 11:10.916
One moment. The doctor's dead.

11:11.541 --> 11:13.125
-What?
-Dr. Sverre is dead.

11:13.708 --> 11:15.708
You have to stop smiling when people die.

11:15.791 --> 11:17.541
Yeah, but… I'm sorry.

11:25.916 --> 11:28.166
-Yeah, it's Frode.
-Frode, it's Odd.

11:28.250 --> 11:29.333
Hi, Odd.

11:29.416 --> 11:32.625
I just got a funeral.

11:33.375 --> 11:34.708
-Really?
-Yeah.

11:35.208 --> 11:37.583
So this should all be fine, right?

11:41.666 --> 11:42.708
Frode, are you there?

11:42.791 --> 11:44.250
Yeah, I'm here.

11:44.333 --> 11:47.541
You do realize that
you have to make money off this funeral?

11:48.083 --> 11:49.291
Yeah, I can do that.

11:51.791 --> 11:52.625
"Can"?

11:54.916 --> 11:55.750
I will.

11:59.500 --> 12:04.500
HALLANGEN FUNERAL PARLOR

12:06.500 --> 12:07.458
Well, boys.

12:08.000 --> 12:08.916
It's me this time.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.250
Right you are.

12:31.916 --> 12:33.458
-Hi, Reinert.
-Odd.

12:34.666 --> 12:35.916
Where's Judith?

12:36.500 --> 12:38.041
Judith is at the station.

12:38.125 --> 12:39.750
-Lots to do.
-Yeah.

12:41.333 --> 12:42.208
Finally.

12:43.083 --> 12:43.916
Yeah.

12:48.208 --> 12:51.208
It's kind of depressing
to think that doctors can die, too.

12:51.291 --> 12:53.208
-Yeah.
-What's next?

12:53.291 --> 12:55.833
Pyromaniac firefighters or

12:57.000 --> 12:58.333
police officers who kill?

13:04.333 --> 13:06.000
So…

13:06.083 --> 13:08.125
Do we think it's suspicious?

13:10.000 --> 13:11.333
No, why would you say that?

13:11.416 --> 13:13.666
It's just nice to avoid
a trip to the coroner.

13:14.458 --> 13:17.041
-This is a completely natural death.
-Yeah.

13:20.041 --> 13:21.583
Male, 60.

13:23.833 --> 13:24.708
Works a lot.

13:25.708 --> 13:27.666
Comes home tired.

13:29.208 --> 13:32.166
Maybe he sits down
with a glass of whiskey.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.041
Feels ill.

13:38.083 --> 13:39.541
Wants to go to the toilet.

13:41.583 --> 13:43.833
Yeah. On the way there,

13:45.791 --> 13:46.791
he keels over.

13:46.875 --> 13:48.083
-And that's that.
-Yeah.

13:48.958 --> 13:51.083
There's no point in sending someone

13:51.166 --> 13:53.708
to the coroner
when it's obviously a natural death.

13:54.500 --> 13:55.875
-In his sixties.
-Overworked.

13:55.958 --> 13:56.791
Felt ill.

13:56.875 --> 13:58.333
-We're not made of money.
-No.

13:58.416 --> 14:00.958
-This isn't New York.
-It's not even Elverum.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.208
Shall we get started?
Can you grab the legs?

14:04.291 --> 14:05.291
Let's see.

14:06.416 --> 14:07.291
Well, hello.

14:08.750 --> 14:10.541
Rigor mortis hasn't even set in yet.

14:10.625 --> 14:11.458
What?

14:12.333 --> 14:14.458
Yeah, it means he's pretty fresh.

14:16.208 --> 14:17.791
Suspiciously fresh, or…

14:18.500 --> 14:20.791
No, he'll probably stiffen

14:21.916 --> 14:23.791
-but not yet, as you can see.
-Right.

14:26.875 --> 14:28.208
Nothing suspicious?

14:28.291 --> 14:29.916
Nothing suspicious, no.

14:33.291 --> 14:35.458
Well, what did the ER doctor say?

14:36.041 --> 14:38.541
Sverre is the ER doctor. He's dead.

14:38.625 --> 14:39.458
Yeah.

14:44.791 --> 14:47.916
What did the EMTs say?
They must have noticed something.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.458
Nothing unnatural about the death.

14:50.958 --> 14:52.125
That's a bit odd.

15:03.916 --> 15:06.625
Are you going to order an autopsy
for "a bit odd"?

15:08.625 --> 15:11.291
If there's one thing
that ruins the budget, that's it.

15:15.458 --> 15:16.291
Judith?

15:18.208 --> 15:20.375
I've done a solid piece of police work.

15:22.041 --> 15:25.250
Sverre Hansen died
during the night of an ailment,

15:25.333 --> 15:28.833
in his pajamas, on the way to the toilet.
Nothing suspicious about that.

15:30.916 --> 15:33.125
I just had such a good feeling.

15:33.625 --> 15:35.125
What do you mean, "good feeling"?

15:37.125 --> 15:38.666
Well, a bad feeling.

16:31.208 --> 16:32.708
-Reinert?
-I can't do it.

16:32.791 --> 16:33.958
Now we have--

16:34.791 --> 16:36.125
Come in. Close the door.

16:40.708 --> 16:43.125
We should never
have tampered with the body,

16:43.208 --> 16:46.041
we should just have removed
the evidence. Fuck!

16:46.833 --> 16:49.041
There's no evidence pointing to us.

16:49.125 --> 16:51.083
No, but Judith will find something.

16:51.666 --> 16:55.166
Sverre will be cremated
in a couple of days.

16:55.250 --> 16:56.541
And so will all the evidence.

16:56.625 --> 16:59.166
Live, I'm a police officer.

16:59.250 --> 17:01.000
And I've killed a person

17:01.083 --> 17:04.958
and covered it up
to make it look like a natural death.

17:05.041 --> 17:07.500
-That's what has happened.
-It wasn't really you.

17:07.583 --> 17:08.625
So who was it?

17:16.208 --> 17:18.750
Are you trying to say that I'll be…

17:21.458 --> 17:23.250
a monster for the rest of my life?

17:23.750 --> 17:26.750
You're not a monster, Reinert.

17:27.333 --> 17:28.875
You're not a monster.

17:28.958 --> 17:32.000
If you are, then I'm a monster, too.

17:39.250 --> 17:40.750
No. Of course you're not.

17:42.041 --> 17:43.000
No.

17:48.625 --> 17:49.458
Rei…

17:54.125 --> 17:55.791
Yeah. Of course.

17:56.375 --> 17:58.666
You only need me
when you want to get away with murder.

18:23.583 --> 18:25.000
Number 43.

18:25.083 --> 18:27.375
White-painted casket, solid pine.

18:27.458 --> 18:29.666
We have number 33, made of birch.

18:29.750 --> 18:34.458
It comes with foil, white paint,
or wood fiber. Lots to choose from.

18:35.250 --> 18:37.416
Yeah, I… I don't know
what we should choose.

18:37.500 --> 18:38.375
No.

18:38.916 --> 18:40.166
No, it's not easy.

18:42.583 --> 18:43.708
But Wenche,

18:44.541 --> 18:47.166
I don't think we're here
to pick a coffin for your brother.

18:48.291 --> 18:49.208
What?

18:49.291 --> 18:51.125
No, you and I, we knew him.

18:51.666 --> 18:53.541
He's been our family doctor
since the '80s.

18:53.625 --> 18:55.291
I think he delivered me, actually.

18:57.375 --> 19:00.250
And your brother wore
high quality clothing.

19:00.791 --> 19:04.125
He lived in the nicest house
in Skarnes. Drove a Porsche.

19:05.333 --> 19:07.666
And I could of course sell you a Toyota.

19:08.833 --> 19:10.875
Yeah, or a Škoda, for that matter.

19:10.958 --> 19:11.958
Yeah…

19:13.500 --> 19:15.958
No. At the risk of repeating myself,

19:16.708 --> 19:20.208
I don't think we're here
to pick a coffin for your brother.

19:24.125 --> 19:25.666
He's already chosen for us.

19:28.125 --> 19:32.333
Number 52 is made of
mahogany-stained cherry wood,

19:32.416 --> 19:34.375
which gives it an exquisite finish.

19:36.416 --> 19:39.000
This is the closest I can get
to your brother's Porsche.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.333
That's who he was in life.

19:43.833 --> 19:46.833
Who are we to say
he should be someone else in death?

19:57.791 --> 19:59.458
'TIL DEATH DO US PART

19:59.541 --> 20:02.791
I had to finish
what your mother and I started.

20:05.750 --> 20:07.833
Hi. I think your brother has gone mad.

20:08.333 --> 20:09.625
You see?

20:09.708 --> 20:12.916
-You understand why we're going down?
-Oh, it's that one.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.916
-That's what's up.
-Oh my God.

20:16.708 --> 20:18.708
-Hi.
-I sold the mahogany coffin.

20:18.791 --> 20:19.875
-You're kidding!
-No.

20:19.958 --> 20:20.791
Yes!

20:20.875 --> 20:21.833
Fantastic!

20:23.166 --> 20:24.125
Oh, I'm sorry.

20:24.208 --> 20:25.916
-Fantastic.
-Yeah, I know.

20:26.000 --> 20:30.291
And not just the mahogany coffin.
Three hundred programs, lots of music…

20:30.375 --> 20:31.208
The works!

20:31.291 --> 20:33.500
-It's turning around, Odd!
-Yes, it is!

20:33.583 --> 20:36.041
You little tadpole.

20:36.583 --> 20:38.833
You'll have the nicest room
in all of Skarnes.

20:38.916 --> 20:42.708
And you, you moldy old sock,
will look like a sleeping baby

20:42.791 --> 20:45.500
-by the time I'm done.
-And that's my cue. Bye.

20:45.583 --> 20:48.750
I understand it sounds weird
when I say it like that.

20:48.833 --> 20:50.583
It just sounds weird, period.

20:51.208 --> 20:52.375
Yeah. Fair enough.

21:22.708 --> 21:23.750
What's up?

21:26.250 --> 21:28.000
He's just still so limp.

21:28.083 --> 21:29.625
-You see?
-Oh, right.

21:31.041 --> 21:35.166
No lividity or marbling.

21:37.708 --> 21:39.833
I tried to fold his hands, but it was like

21:40.750 --> 21:42.541
folding spaghetti.

21:46.208 --> 21:47.750
In my department we always say

21:47.833 --> 21:51.583
that rigor mortis can differ a bit
from one person to another.

21:52.500 --> 21:53.458
No.

21:54.041 --> 21:57.166
Rigor mortis always happens post mortem.

21:57.250 --> 22:01.416
When the blood starts coagulating
in the muscle, it goes stiff.

22:02.500 --> 22:04.791
Not if the body was exposed to heat.

22:05.375 --> 22:06.250
In Norway?

22:07.291 --> 22:08.125
In November?

22:14.583 --> 22:15.666
Should I report it?

22:16.708 --> 22:17.541
To the police?

22:18.375 --> 22:19.208
No.

22:19.916 --> 22:20.750
No.

22:22.375 --> 22:23.375
I don't think so.

22:25.125 --> 22:26.000
But

22:27.541 --> 22:29.541
what if it's something suspicious…

22:31.333 --> 22:32.458
that's happened?

22:32.541 --> 22:34.375
To a 60-year-old workaholic?

22:36.166 --> 22:38.000
Yeah, but still…

22:40.291 --> 22:42.000
But, if you send him to the coroner now,

22:42.083 --> 22:44.666
it'll be at least one,

22:44.750 --> 22:47.166
probably two, three weeks,
until you get him back.

22:48.875 --> 22:52.000
So you'll have to postpone
the funeral for a while, and…

22:54.083 --> 22:55.625
you probably can't afford that.

22:55.708 --> 22:57.375
Since we're going bankrupt.

22:57.458 --> 22:58.875
No, I can't.

22:59.833 --> 23:00.833
So…

23:02.291 --> 23:03.500
Now you have…

23:05.541 --> 23:08.958
an opportunity to save the business.
It's a shame not to take it.

23:12.416 --> 23:13.250
You're right.

23:17.083 --> 23:21.125
OTHER SIDE OF THE RIVER?
CAUSE OF DEATH?

23:31.916 --> 23:37.500
You've reached the voicemail of police
officer Reinert G. Tisthamar in Skarnes.

23:41.583 --> 23:42.708
Hi.

23:42.791 --> 23:44.208
I just wanted to…

23:45.500 --> 23:46.583
Well, I…

23:46.666 --> 23:49.666
I don't only need you
to get away with murder.

24:48.833 --> 24:49.708
Rose?

24:57.083 --> 24:58.291
I have to tell you something.

25:08.416 --> 25:11.708
-I didn't mean to…
-Then what the fuck did you mean to do?

25:14.958 --> 25:16.500
-Don't follow me!
-I'm sorry.

25:16.583 --> 25:18.750
Why the hell didn't you tell me?

25:18.833 --> 25:21.333
Up until just now, I thought I could…

25:21.416 --> 25:23.875
I don't understand
why you haven't said anything until now.

25:23.958 --> 25:26.583
If there's something wrong with the body,
I have to report it!

25:26.666 --> 25:28.083
I have to tell Judith! Fuck!

25:29.833 --> 25:30.666
Hey…

25:31.250 --> 25:32.083
I'm sorry.

26:06.166 --> 26:07.583
Reinert! Hi.

26:09.541 --> 26:12.000
-What the fuck?
-Live, what are you doing here?

26:12.083 --> 26:13.416
What am I doing there?

26:14.333 --> 26:16.875
POLICE STATION

26:16.958 --> 26:19.458
-Are you positive?
-Yeah, I'm positive.

26:20.000 --> 26:23.125
Something is wrong in Skarnes.
Funeral agent Odd Hallangen--

26:23.208 --> 26:25.041
The brother of the woman…

26:25.125 --> 26:28.083
The brother of the woman
who woke up on the autopsy table.

26:28.166 --> 26:29.666
-Whom you declared dead?
-Yes.

26:29.750 --> 26:32.791
I declared her dead, and I've taken
full responsibility for that,

26:32.875 --> 26:37.125
but now I'm asking for permission
to have Sverre Hansen autopsied.

26:37.208 --> 26:38.916
Why, Judith?

26:40.166 --> 26:42.333
-Because I think he was killed.
-By whom?

26:43.583 --> 26:46.500
-No one can hear us now!
-Hush! We'll do it here.

26:47.375 --> 26:50.375
You can't just barge
into the station like that.

26:50.458 --> 26:53.250
Odd realized it wasn't natural
and called Judith,

26:53.333 --> 26:56.000
and as soon as Sverre is autopsied,
we're fucked.

26:56.750 --> 26:57.666
Holy shit.

26:58.375 --> 27:01.583
Yeah. And whose genius idea was that?

27:01.666 --> 27:05.541
To let Odd bury the person we killed?

27:05.625 --> 27:08.000
Just to keep that stupid business going…

27:08.083 --> 27:11.541
-It's not the business. It's our family.
-Yeah, okay.

27:12.291 --> 27:14.000
Can't you stop Judith?

27:14.083 --> 27:15.333
Stop Judith?

27:15.416 --> 27:16.708
Did you see that board?

27:18.416 --> 27:20.000
Judith suspects you

27:20.833 --> 27:23.500
for everything
that's happened in Skarnes lately,

27:23.583 --> 27:25.208
and she doesn't even know the half of it.

27:25.291 --> 27:27.125
You have to help me. To help us.

27:27.208 --> 27:30.791
-What can I do? I'm not a murderer.
-Yes, you are!

27:37.291 --> 27:38.125
Shit.

27:39.625 --> 27:40.625
My whole career…

27:42.666 --> 27:43.916
My whole life…

27:46.166 --> 27:50.250
the only thing I wanted to do
was solve a murder mystery in Skarnes.

27:54.583 --> 27:58.000
I can't bear that I'm the murderer
in that scenario, Live.

27:59.708 --> 28:00.833
I can't take it.

28:22.208 --> 28:24.000
I'm sorry.

28:24.083 --> 28:25.375
Yeah, I'm sorry.

28:25.458 --> 28:27.750
I really don't want to ruin this.

28:35.083 --> 28:35.916
I love you.

28:36.416 --> 28:38.250
-Odd?
-I love you too.

28:40.500 --> 28:41.333
Odd?

28:43.083 --> 28:43.916
Hi.

28:45.625 --> 28:46.666
Can I talk to you?

28:47.958 --> 28:50.041
What proof do you really have, Judith?

28:50.125 --> 28:52.208
I don't have proof.
I don't have proof yet.

28:52.291 --> 28:56.208
But I'll have it
if I can have the body autopsied.

28:57.125 --> 28:58.291
Okay, Judith.

28:58.375 --> 29:00.083
First, send the body to the coroner,

29:00.166 --> 29:02.875
and then you can detain
Live Hallangen for 24 hours.

29:02.958 --> 29:06.291
-Thanks!
-But this has to produce some results.

29:06.375 --> 29:08.750
You won't regret this. Thank you so much.

29:09.250 --> 29:12.666
So I felt I had to tell Judith.

29:13.833 --> 29:15.333
Even if it means bankruptcy?

29:16.041 --> 29:17.250
Yes.

29:18.541 --> 29:21.041
Being able to live with myself
is more important

29:21.125 --> 29:23.250
than the survival of the funeral parlor.

29:23.333 --> 29:24.958
Maybe, I don't know.

29:27.166 --> 29:28.541
I have to show you something.

29:31.416 --> 29:32.750
You found it? Great!

29:34.416 --> 29:35.500
Where did you find it?

29:37.708 --> 29:39.000
Sverre had it.

29:39.583 --> 29:41.583
Where did… Where did Sverre find it?

29:46.166 --> 29:47.166
He didn't find it.

29:48.291 --> 29:50.750
It was he who…

29:50.833 --> 29:53.125
-But…
-And yesterday…

29:54.125 --> 29:55.000
He…

29:56.875 --> 29:57.708
Or…

29:59.208 --> 30:00.291
I…

30:03.750 --> 30:05.833
Were you involved in Sverre's death?

30:07.541 --> 30:09.083
I didn't do it on purpose.

30:10.041 --> 30:13.041
So what do we do?
I've already told her that…

30:13.125 --> 30:15.583
I'm going to go and say I did it,

30:15.666 --> 30:18.458
and maybe you won't
have to have him autopsied

30:18.541 --> 30:19.666
and sell the house.

30:22.125 --> 30:22.958
But…

30:27.375 --> 30:28.291
But…

30:32.333 --> 30:33.583
Just go to Rose.

30:53.791 --> 30:56.625
Wait. This time I'll do it the right way.

31:03.958 --> 31:07.041
I wonder if I may have been
a bit rash when I called earlier…

31:07.125 --> 31:09.500
I want him autopsied right away.

31:09.583 --> 31:11.791
You don't need to have him autopsied.

31:13.333 --> 31:14.208
Live…

31:14.708 --> 31:17.166
I'm detaining you
for the murder of Sverre Hansen.

31:17.750 --> 31:19.541
But, first, we're sending him
to the coroner.

31:19.625 --> 31:23.916
I've already prepared him for the funeral.
Sverre's sister ordered the whole package…

31:24.000 --> 31:26.708
That's okay.
I have to know the cause of death.

31:26.791 --> 31:28.625
Send him to the coroner immediately.

31:29.916 --> 31:30.833
Shall we?

31:45.125 --> 31:46.666
Do I need to handcuff you?

31:46.750 --> 31:47.750
-No.
-Let's go, then.

31:51.500 --> 31:52.375
What's going on?

31:56.041 --> 31:56.916
Odd?

32:00.583 --> 32:02.291
-Sorry, I have to go to the basement.
-What?

32:02.375 --> 32:04.375
I have to send Dr. Sverre to the coroner.

32:09.583 --> 32:11.916
Do you have enough proof to arrest her?

32:12.000 --> 32:14.708
-Kongsvinger wants to…
-I've only detained her.

32:15.708 --> 32:18.000
And you can remind Kongsvinger

32:18.083 --> 32:20.875
that they allowed me
to detain her for 24 hours

32:20.958 --> 32:22.208
while I collect evidence.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
No one has seen as much death as Odd.

32:26.500 --> 32:29.458
So when he says there's
something suspicious about the body,

32:29.541 --> 32:32.458
it makes me believe
I'll find the evidence I need.

32:33.333 --> 32:37.916
The evidence I need
to arrest and charge Live Hallangen.

32:56.458 --> 32:57.416
Live?

33:01.875 --> 33:03.416
Dad was right.

33:05.833 --> 33:06.750
About what?

33:11.791 --> 33:13.000
I'm not worth it.

33:18.791 --> 33:19.958
I'm sorry, Reinert.

33:21.833 --> 33:22.666
Live…

33:24.875 --> 33:26.458
let's get out of Skarnes.

33:28.208 --> 33:30.583
Come with me. I can't do this alone.

33:32.083 --> 33:34.208
You're the only one
who knows what this is.

33:40.500 --> 33:44.500
Nothing will change,
even if we leave Skarnes.

33:47.791 --> 33:48.625
Yeah.

33:49.708 --> 33:50.916
We can stick together.

34:05.416 --> 34:06.375
Reinert?

34:06.916 --> 34:07.875
What's going on?

34:12.875 --> 34:14.166
New testimony.

34:14.708 --> 34:16.000
-Testimony?
-Yeah.

34:16.083 --> 34:17.958
I'd like to check a couple of things.

34:18.916 --> 34:21.000
Just go through a couple of points.

34:24.041 --> 34:25.125
Yeah, okay. Go ahead.

34:34.916 --> 34:35.916
Fuck!

34:37.041 --> 34:39.416
He's being autopsied.
They could call at any moment.

34:39.500 --> 34:41.541
So you have a guy
who's been sentenced to death…

34:41.625 --> 34:42.833
In Norway?

34:42.916 --> 34:44.458
Yeah, in the Viking Age.

34:44.541 --> 34:46.125
Okay, what was he convicted of?

34:46.208 --> 34:48.166
Asking too many questions.

34:48.250 --> 34:49.916
Wow. What?

34:50.000 --> 34:51.000
That's beautiful.

34:51.666 --> 34:54.791
The condemned gets to choose
between three different rooms.

34:54.875 --> 34:57.041
The first room is full of fire,

34:57.125 --> 35:00.625
the second room is full
of assassins with loaded guns…

35:00.708 --> 35:01.750
In the Viking Age?

35:01.833 --> 35:05.625
…and the third room is full of lions
that haven't eaten in three years.

35:06.166 --> 35:08.208
Which room is the safest?

35:14.416 --> 35:15.500
The third one.

35:17.916 --> 35:20.708
Lions who haven't eaten
in three years are dead.

35:26.041 --> 35:27.208
What the fu--

35:28.208 --> 35:30.875
Skarnes police station, Marianne speaking.

35:32.583 --> 35:33.625
-Judith?
-Yeah?

35:33.708 --> 35:35.291
It's the forensic institute.

35:35.791 --> 35:37.000
Reinert, I…

35:37.083 --> 35:39.541
We just have to wait, and then…

35:39.625 --> 35:40.625
Reinert!

35:43.291 --> 35:44.958
-God damn it.
-What's up?

35:45.041 --> 35:47.875
You have to take this.
I have to go talk to Odd.

35:47.958 --> 35:49.291
Damn it.

35:50.625 --> 35:52.708
What are you doing over there in Skarnes?

35:53.250 --> 35:55.083
I honestly have no idea.

35:55.166 --> 35:57.500
First you send a body that isn't dead…

35:57.583 --> 36:00.125
-What?
-…and then you send us an embalmed body.

36:01.125 --> 36:02.125
Embalmed?

36:02.208 --> 36:03.625
Yes, embalmed.

36:05.666 --> 36:06.500
Odd?

36:08.583 --> 36:10.250
Open the door!

36:11.250 --> 36:13.875
How am I supposed
to find the cause of death,

36:13.958 --> 36:16.250
when the corpse is embalmed,
drained of blood,

36:16.333 --> 36:19.125
tampered with in every way--
It's impossible!

36:19.208 --> 36:20.083
Odd?

36:25.583 --> 36:26.625
Judith.

36:26.708 --> 36:28.916
I know you're angry,
but I tried to tell you.

36:29.000 --> 36:30.083
Tell me what?

36:30.166 --> 36:33.333
That Dr. Sverre Hansen's sister
demanded the whole package.

36:33.416 --> 36:35.208
-Whole package?
-Yeah.

36:35.291 --> 36:37.125
Mahogany-stained cherry wood coffin,

36:38.125 --> 36:40.583
300 programs,
lots of musicians, a full choir, and,

36:41.166 --> 36:42.583
as you have probably guessed,

36:44.000 --> 36:44.958
embalming.

36:46.000 --> 36:48.708
Do you know what this means
for the investigation?

36:50.250 --> 36:51.291
It's bad?

36:51.375 --> 36:55.125
There's no point in doing an autopsy
when you've filled the body with…

36:56.041 --> 36:57.208
Formalin.

37:01.291 --> 37:04.583
Does that mean I can go on
with the funeral as planned?

37:04.666 --> 37:06.125
Shut up, Odd!

37:06.208 --> 37:08.375
You can go to hell!

38:00.833 --> 38:02.708
Dear big brother.

38:05.166 --> 38:08.375
I remember when you took me
camping for the first time.

38:10.458 --> 38:11.708
You had made lists

38:12.625 --> 38:14.458
-many weeks beforehand.
-Are you okay?

38:14.541 --> 38:16.416
-Yeah.
-…and tent rods…

38:17.833 --> 38:18.708
But…

38:19.416 --> 38:22.208
-Do you think it's weird being here?
-…you didn't give up on me.

38:22.333 --> 38:23.166
No.

38:25.916 --> 38:29.041
-Not even when I got stuck in the bog.
-Yeah, it was…

38:30.458 --> 38:31.416
Yeah.

38:31.500 --> 38:34.166
You spent a long time pulling me out.

38:35.541 --> 38:39.250
Even though
both our boots were full of mud…

39:15.541 --> 39:17.416
There's something wrong with this picture.

39:18.375 --> 39:19.250
Isn't there?

39:22.166 --> 39:23.041
Yeah.

39:24.958 --> 39:25.833
Very.

39:44.291 --> 39:45.708
What are you thinking about?

41:09.291 --> 41:10.583
What's wrong?

41:10.666 --> 41:13.000
Nothing.

43:05.208 --> 43:09.250
