00:01.915 --> 00:03.215
<i>So what do
you think, Chalky?</i>

00:03.250 --> 00:04.884
I can mix this up real nice.

00:04.919 --> 00:07.922
500 bottles will get you 3000.

00:07.955 --> 00:10.459
They put me out of business.
How can I pay youse?

00:10.493 --> 00:12.762
That's your problem, ain't it?

00:12.796 --> 00:15.031
What are to be my duties,
madame Jeunet?

00:15.066 --> 00:16.533
You will assist the customers

00:16.568 --> 00:18.202
<i>when they try the garments
on, n'est-ce pas?</i>

00:18.236 --> 00:20.105
You came to see Nucky.

00:20.139 --> 00:23.242
- I'm Margaret Schroeder.
- Bully for you.

00:23.276 --> 00:24.410
All right.

00:24.445 --> 00:26.347
Who shot you?
What'd he look like?

00:28.584 --> 00:29.784
Good God, man.

00:29.819 --> 00:31.386
Jimmy.

00:31.421 --> 00:32.387
Fair-haired?

00:32.421 --> 00:34.489
M-masks.
Masks.

00:34.524 --> 00:36.459
- We lost him, sir.
- Did he talk?

00:36.493 --> 00:38.261
Sir, I have reason to believe

00:38.295 --> 00:40.965
<i>James Darmody was involved
in the woods massacre.</i>

00:40.999 --> 00:42.233
You're through here, kid.

00:42.267 --> 00:43.568
Where am I supposed to go?

00:43.603 --> 00:47.239
Broadway limited
going to Chicago, Illinois.

00:48.809 --> 00:50.777
<i>It's an election
year, Chalky.</i>

00:50.811 --> 00:52.212
This goes no further than here.

00:52.246 --> 00:53.714
<i>What happened is</i>

00:53.748 --> 00:55.716
this man was cheating
with another fella's wife.

00:55.751 --> 00:56.985
And the fella shot him.

04:17.426 --> 04:20.560
You'd have pissed your pants

04:20.595 --> 04:22.196
You think it's funny?

04:22.230 --> 04:25.432
Easy, Princeton.
I was fuckin' playing.

04:25.466 --> 04:27.200
I need the keys to the car.

04:27.234 --> 04:30.737
I can't hear out of my ear.

04:30.771 --> 04:33.273
Quit your bellyaching

04:40.379 --> 04:45.416

I'm okay.

04:45.451 --> 04:48.786
- You're bleeding.
- What?

04:51.789 --> 04:53.623
Aw.

04:56.427 --> 04:59.295
This is never gonna work out.

05:01.931 --> 05:03.631
<i>What?</i>

05:03.666 --> 05:07.134
No! Oh, come on,
you shouldn't have.

05:07.169 --> 05:09.202
<i>- Now who planned this?
- Nucky?</i>

05:09.236 --> 05:11.337
Jesus! Fuck.

05:11.372 --> 05:12.972
How long you been
standing there?

05:13.007 --> 05:15.541
I... very shortly.

05:15.575 --> 05:17.609
What do you want?
I was rehearsing a speech.

05:17.644 --> 05:21.112
You asked to review
the guest list for the party.

05:21.147 --> 05:23.614
Right, yeah.

05:23.649 --> 05:25.116
Well, let's hear it.

05:25.150 --> 05:29.219
Hank Adamo, Steven Mueller...
I'm giving a speech next week

05:29.253 --> 05:32.321
to the restaurant
workers association.

05:32.356 --> 05:33.622
What I was rehearsing.

05:33.657 --> 05:38.760
Yes. Richard Berman...
I'm going shopping.

05:47.735 --> 05:49.336
Get something pretty.

05:50.838 --> 05:53.305
You know, you tore me
apart last night.

05:53.339 --> 05:56.574
Jesus, Lucy.

06:02.179 --> 06:03.913
Make sure you invite
governor Edwards.

06:03.948 --> 06:07.082
<i>- He will not come.
- I know. Despite that.</i>

06:07.116 --> 06:10.249
Can you believe they elected
that asshole democrat no-hoper?

06:10.284 --> 06:13.118
I booked suites for senator
Edge and Mayor Hague.

06:13.152 --> 06:17.221
Visiting royalty...
Edge especially.

06:17.255 --> 06:19.857
- Hand me my shoes.
- Which ones?

06:21.292 --> 06:23.059
Ah.

06:25.062 --> 06:27.296
<i>- Make sure Edge gets the bigger suite.
- Mm-h.</i>

06:27.331 --> 06:30.299
He's my ticket to that
road appropriations money.

06:30.333 --> 06:31.766
Ja.

06:31.801 --> 06:35.069
Almost 30 million
for Jersey alone.

06:35.103 --> 06:38.772
You cabet your keister I'm
gonna get a piece of that pie.

06:40.074 --> 06:43.642
It's an expression...
"a piece of the pie."

06:43.676 --> 06:45.344
Don't you have pie in Germany?

06:45.378 --> 06:47.412
We have strudel.

06:48.748 --> 06:51.549
Just make sure
everybody gets laid.

06:51.583 --> 06:53.584
<i>"Could it be the
beautiful young woman</i>

06:53.619 --> 06:55.385
<i>found shivering
in the river</i>

06:55.420 --> 06:58.120
is actually
who she claims to be...

06:58.155 --> 07:00.355
the daughter
of the czar of Russia,

07:00.389 --> 07:03.390
<i>the grand duchess Anastasia?"</i>

07:03.424 --> 07:05.892
It's like a fairy tale.

07:05.927 --> 07:08.428
"Was she assassinated
at the hands of the Bolsheviks

07:08.463 --> 07:11.131
or did she masterfully
escape the fate

07:11.165 --> 07:13.600
of her doomed
royal family?"

07:13.634 --> 07:15.668
<i>- Give me it.
- Mine.</i>

07:15.703 --> 07:17.937
<i>- Give it to me!
- Pipe down or you'll get a spanking.</i>

07:17.972 --> 07:20.407
There's no need
for that now, is there?

07:20.441 --> 07:22.142
You spoil them.

07:22.176 --> 07:24.511
Look at this.

07:24.545 --> 07:29.415
"Anastasia Romanov, thought
dead these past three years,

07:29.449 --> 07:31.583
could very well be
the rightful identity

07:31.618 --> 07:34.486
of Anna Anderson,
the amnesia victim

07:34.520 --> 07:37.421
now claiming to be
the princess."

07:37.456 --> 07:40.457
- Who's a princess?
- You are, my darling.

07:40.492 --> 07:42.059
And I'm the queen of england.

07:42.093 --> 07:43.560
Really?

07:43.595 --> 07:45.762
Where's your
sense of romance, Edith?

07:45.797 --> 07:47.731
It left along with my husband.

07:47.765 --> 07:49.298
Read the funnies, mama.

07:49.333 --> 07:52.168
- Mind your manners.
- Please?

07:52.202 --> 07:53.636
All right, quickly.

07:53.670 --> 07:55.504
Then I've got
to leave for work.

07:55.538 --> 08:00.475
Let's see what mischief mutt
and Jeff have been up to.

08:04.245 --> 08:08.548
Soy. Does it hurt?

08:09.450 --> 08:11.884
A little bit.

08:11.918 --> 08:14.286
You should try some opium.

08:14.320 --> 08:16.288
There's den in Chinatown.

08:16.322 --> 08:18.289
- Let me take you?
- I don't know.

08:18.323 --> 08:20.091
With all those hopheads?

08:20.125 --> 08:25.228
It's divine... it really is...
for whatever ails you.

08:30.867 --> 08:34.501
That fella Al... he can be
really scary sometimes.

08:34.537 --> 08:38.172
He's all right.
He's just from Brooklyn is all.

08:38.206 --> 08:40.274
Is that where you're from?

08:40.308 --> 08:42.576
- Atlantic City.
- Mm.

08:42.610 --> 08:44.911
Star prairie, Wisconsin.

08:44.945 --> 08:47.246
Right, sure.

08:47.281 --> 08:50.516
Don't pretend like
you ever heard of it.

08:50.550 --> 08:53.118
What's it like?

08:53.152 --> 08:57.021
Well, grandpa was the first
white man born in town,

08:57.055 --> 08:59.190
pa was the first man
got sent to state prison,

08:59.224 --> 09:02.025
and ma was the first woman
run over flat by a car.

09:02.059 --> 09:04.661
So you could say I've got
a lot to live up to.

09:04.695 --> 09:07.330
I'll say you do.

09:07.364 --> 09:10.632
So did you really
go to college?

09:11.767 --> 09:13.201
Where'd you hear that?

09:13.236 --> 09:15.036
Al's always
calling you Princeton.

09:15.071 --> 09:16.538
<i>Yeah, well
where I come from,</i>

09:16.572 --> 09:20.040
some people had an idea about
what I was supposed to be.

09:20.074 --> 09:22.242
<i>- Your pa?
- No.</i>

09:22.276 --> 09:24.544
That's not something he'd do.

09:24.578 --> 09:28.113
There's a fella, kinda like...
kinda like Torrio here.

09:28.148 --> 09:30.449
He saw me along
through the years.

09:30.483 --> 09:35.053
That's...
that's over with now.

09:35.087 --> 09:38.922
- So what's your idea?
- Beg your pardon?

09:38.957 --> 09:41.825
About what you're
supposed to be.

09:41.860 --> 09:44.294
Oh.

09:44.328 --> 09:45.962
That's a good question.

09:45.996 --> 09:48.897
Hmm.

09:48.931 --> 09:51.532
I looked at your book
while you were sleeping.

09:51.567 --> 09:53.334
<i>Yeah?
What'd you think?</i>

09:53.368 --> 09:57.071
I'm heading west myself,
like the girl in the story...

09:57.105 --> 09:58.939
California,
as soon as I save up.

09:58.974 --> 10:00.474
You're gonna be
in the pictures?

10:02.477 --> 10:04.611
- Gee, I don't know, maybe.
- Well, you're certainly pretty enough.

10:04.645 --> 10:08.282
- Don't kid a kidder.
- You are.

10:08.316 --> 10:10.684
You're prettier
than Lillian Gish.

10:10.718 --> 10:12.852
I'd watch you.

10:14.955 --> 10:18.323
Would you save me
from my brutish father?

10:18.357 --> 10:20.091
He's out of prison?

10:20.126 --> 10:22.460
Like Lillian Gish.

10:22.494 --> 10:24.895
"Broken blossoms"?

10:24.930 --> 10:27.564
I'd sure give it a shot.

10:27.599 --> 10:32.368
Well, then maybe
I'll let you come with me.

10:34.138 --> 10:36.505
You'll let me?

10:36.539 --> 10:39.308
I might.

10:39.342 --> 10:42.110
How come?

10:42.144 --> 10:45.613
'Cause I think you need
taking care of.

10:58.325 --> 11:01.293
<i>- What the fuck is taking you so long?
- We've been trying, Nucky.</i>

11:01.327 --> 11:04.295
- It ain't like we haven't asked around.
- Asked around?

11:04.329 --> 11:06.864
You're trying to solve a
murder, not find a lost cat.

11:06.898 --> 11:09.266
A cat would be easier.
Nobody cares about some colored kid.

11:09.301 --> 11:11.534
Chalky cares,
so that means I care.

11:11.569 --> 11:14.437
And you can bet your ass come
election day you' gonna care too.

11:14.471 --> 11:16.906
Control Atlantic City,
you control Atlantic county.

11:16.940 --> 11:18.907
- Control Atlantic County...
- Control New Jersey, I know.

11:18.941 --> 11:21.976
If you know, then you'd know how
much we need the colored vote.

11:22.010 --> 11:24.278
Like it or not,
they're 20% of the city, Eli.

11:24.312 --> 11:26.446
And they vote the way he tells 'em
to, so drink your damn coffee.

11:26.480 --> 11:28.748
They vote the way
I tell Chalky to tell them.

11:28.782 --> 11:31.216
He drives a Packard,
Nucky, because of you.

11:31.251 --> 11:33.151
He lives in a house
bigger than the Mayor.

11:33.185 --> 11:34.886
You seriously think
he'd ever risk all that,

11:34.920 --> 11:37.721
<i>- let his people vote democrat?
- At this point, no.</i>

11:37.756 --> 11:40.190
But there are limits to what
he can sell those people,

11:40.224 --> 11:41.891
and a lynching's
not one of them.

11:41.926 --> 11:44.027
- If word got out...
- He needs you, Nuck.

11:44.061 --> 11:46.195
- No one's ever gonna know.
- And we need him.

11:46.229 --> 11:49.898
One hand washes the other
and both hands wash the face.

11:49.932 --> 11:53.500
Take a lot of suds to wash Chalky's face.

11:55.937 --> 11:57.637
You can wait in the hall.

12:09.148 --> 12:11.316
I don't like that fella.
I never have.

12:11.350 --> 12:14.051
He's a good man, Halloran...
ready and able.

12:14.086 --> 12:16.453
Just step it up, will ya?

12:18.990 --> 12:21.157
Gillian, fix it.

12:21.192 --> 12:24.694
- Let me see, darling.
- Gillian?

12:24.728 --> 12:28.063
You know most women are
proud to be called grandma.

12:28.097 --> 12:31.966
Not while the peaches
are still in season.

12:34.769 --> 12:38.038
- I shouldn't be very long.
- Oh, take your time.

12:38.072 --> 12:41.074
I've got my man
to keep me company.

12:41.108 --> 12:44.210
- Say goodbye to mama.
- Bye, mama.

12:47.713 --> 12:50.014
Let's see here.

12:50.049 --> 12:54.752
Oh, they make such shoddy
merchandise these days.

12:54.786 --> 12:57.087
You know when your daddy
was a little boy,

12:57.121 --> 13:00.657
he had a blue tin train
with big round wheels.

13:00.691 --> 13:04.593
- A choo-choo.
- That's right, it was a choo-choo train.

13:04.628 --> 13:08.063
And it was a gift
from one of my admirers.

13:08.097 --> 13:09.931
He was in
the dry goods business.

13:09.965 --> 13:13.166
All better.

13:13.201 --> 13:15.201
- What do you say?
- Thank you.

13:15.235 --> 13:17.070
Where's my kiss?

13:17.104 --> 13:18.704
Mwah!

13:18.739 --> 13:21.607
You are gonna break
a million hearts one day.

13:21.641 --> 13:23.609
- No.
- You know that?

13:23.643 --> 13:27.278
Run along now.
There you go.

13:35.386 --> 13:37.787
<i>I just need
to move it.</i>

13:49.598 --> 13:53.066
- Mrs. Darmody?
- Yes?

13:54.501 --> 13:55.968
I'm a friend of James.

13:56.002 --> 13:58.504
His friends call him Jimmy.

13:58.538 --> 14:00.906
So who are you really?

14:00.940 --> 14:06.744
I'm a what-do-you-call...
an acquaintance from New York.

14:06.779 --> 14:08.713
That part I suspected.

14:08.747 --> 14:10.981
- What's your name?
- Never mind my name.

14:11.016 --> 14:13.884
- Is he here or ain't he?
- He's not.

14:13.918 --> 14:17.587
- Then where is he?
- Maybe he's up your ass.

14:17.621 --> 14:19.722
Have you considered
looking there?

14:21.224 --> 14:23.058
You got a fresh mouth
for a broad.

14:23.093 --> 14:26.161
Maybe I need you
to smack it for me, right?

14:27.796 --> 14:29.230
The roughneck bit...

14:29.264 --> 14:33.600
is that what the little girls
are going for these days?

14:38.405 --> 14:42.441
<i>Filthy immigrants
,</i> Christ-killing Jews,

14:42.475 --> 14:45.711
<i>anarchists of every stripe...</i>

14:45.745 --> 14:49.514
...Dangerous though they may be,
make no mistake, my brethren,

14:49.548 --> 14:53.918
it is the coon <i>that is the true
bane of our great nation.</i>

14:53.952 --> 14:57.488
<i>Up from the south they come
like so many rats,</i>

14:57.522 --> 15:01.992
feeding on jobs heretofore
reserved for white men;

15:02.026 --> 15:05.861
Veterans, patriots,
true Americans all,

15:05.895 --> 15:09.831
consigned to the bread lines,
their families starving

15:09.865 --> 15:11.766
while the nigger
gorges himself.

15:11.800 --> 15:14.435
<i>It is our
God-given right,</i>

15:14.469 --> 15:18.005
it is our Christian duty
to eradicate this scourge...

15:18.039 --> 15:19.539
nobody move!

15:24.845 --> 15:26.445
Who's in charge here?

15:30.449 --> 15:33.018
<i>- State your name.
- Joseph Earl Dinler,</i>

15:33.052 --> 15:35.386
grand cyclops of the knights
of the Ku Klux Klan,

15:35.421 --> 15:39.089
- Atlantic county branch.
- Lose the dunce caps.

15:42.159 --> 15:43.793
You too, cyclops.

15:49.065 --> 15:52.267
You're the fella who owns
the hardware store on Pacific.

15:52.302 --> 15:54.169
<i>He sold me linseed oil
not a month ago.</i>

15:54.203 --> 15:56.671
If you're here to rob us,
take what you will and leave

15:56.706 --> 15:58.739
with what little conscience
you might have.

15:58.774 --> 16:00.508
Drop the act.
You know who I am.

16:00.542 --> 16:02.876
You're a grafter, a whoremonger

16:02.911 --> 16:05.678
- and a bootlegger.
- You're thinking of my brother.

16:05.712 --> 16:07.379
Let's go.
You're under arrest.

16:07.413 --> 16:09.247
Everybody else
stay in your seats.

16:14.954 --> 16:16.388
What's this about?

16:16.422 --> 16:19.224
Being in the Klan's
not against the law.

16:19.258 --> 16:22.694
No, but stringing up
darkies is.

16:27.698 --> 16:29.833
Yeah, we got our rights.

17:15.969 --> 17:17.670
You gotta be reasonable, huh?

17:17.704 --> 17:20.704
Mr. Sheridan says I can't
be buying from nobody else.

17:20.740 --> 17:24.142
You're good then, 'cause
we ain't nobody else.

17:24.175 --> 17:26.176
This is Johnny Torrio's
territory now.

17:26.211 --> 17:27.944
You should talk
to Mr. Sheridan, no?

17:27.979 --> 17:30.613
- I don't know nothing.
- What do you mean you know nothing?

17:30.648 --> 17:32.582
You greeks...
you got intelligence.

17:32.616 --> 17:34.583
I mean, you invented
arithmetic, right?

17:34.618 --> 17:37.052
I don't know. Yes.

17:37.086 --> 17:38.753
Then you should know
what happens next.

17:38.788 --> 17:41.189
See, I say you gotta
buy from us,

17:41.223 --> 17:44.158
then you give me some lip,
then the next thing you know...

17:47.461 --> 17:50.897
- you all right, demo?
- Hey, you got something to say?

17:53.333 --> 17:55.901
What happens now
is I help you up.

17:59.438 --> 18:00.972
- Ahh!
- But not really.

18:01.006 --> 18:03.740
<i>- Al.
- Please, why you do this?</i>

18:03.775 --> 18:07.610
<i>- Al, come on.
- Come on what?</i>

18:07.645 --> 18:10.012
I'm in the middle
of a fucking conversation.

18:12.115 --> 18:14.983
Next I break every bottle
in this fuckin' joint.

18:15.018 --> 18:16.985
- Please, no!
- Good.

18:17.020 --> 18:18.820
These people look thirsty,

18:18.854 --> 18:21.455
so you'll want a big order
when the truck comes around.

18:21.490 --> 18:26.426
Oh yeah, if Sheridan got a problem...
Uh!

18:26.460 --> 18:28.027
...You tell him
to come see me.

18:28.062 --> 18:31.163
I'm at the four deuces
over on Wabash.

18:32.232 --> 18:33.999
Are you staying for supper?

18:41.239 --> 18:43.974
Demo, demo, are you all right?

18:44.008 --> 18:46.042
Help me get him up.

18:47.577 --> 18:49.478
We have the pianist...
the fat one.

18:49.512 --> 18:50.779
Remember you like him.

18:50.814 --> 18:55.917
Roast beef, rack of lamb, oysters
on the half shell, lobster,

18:55.952 --> 19:01.656
and for the wine I have
chosen a Chateau Margaux.

19:01.690 --> 19:04.259
- The fuck is this?
- What?

19:04.293 --> 19:06.093
This.

19:06.127 --> 19:07.995
This...
fucking lip Rouge.

19:08.029 --> 19:10.197
- I will take care of it immediately.
- God fucking damn it.

19:10.231 --> 19:12.966
- I will see that they wash them twice.
- How hard do I work?

19:13.000 --> 19:14.567
The pressure I'm under...

19:14.601 --> 19:17.535
Is it too much to ask that if I have
a simple goddamn birthday party

19:17.570 --> 19:19.137
that the silverware,
the crystal...

19:19.171 --> 19:21.038
- that they be clean?
- Nucky, I have taken...

19:21.072 --> 19:23.372
can I trust you
to do anything right?

19:23.406 --> 19:25.207
The war,
the anti-German bullshit...

19:25.241 --> 19:28.042
- did I not stick with you
despite all that? - Yes, you...

19:28.077 --> 19:30.211
and this is the fucking
thanks I get?

19:30.245 --> 19:32.379
This filthy piece of shit
that some whore

19:32.414 --> 19:34.181
left her cock-smeared
lip Rouge on?

19:34.215 --> 19:35.882
- Do you want me to drink from this?
- No.

19:35.917 --> 19:38.651
- Do you want my guests to drink from this?
- No, of course not.

19:43.890 --> 19:46.258
<i>You there, boy,
scrub these goblets.</i>

19:46.292 --> 19:49.060
<i>Everything...</i>

20:00.436 --> 20:03.939
Please do your best.

20:22.053 --> 20:24.321
Morning.
How'd you sleep?

20:27.258 --> 20:29.325
You Klan fellas...

20:29.359 --> 20:32.394
get you in front of a crowd,
can't shut you up.

20:32.428 --> 20:34.595
In private though...

20:36.264 --> 20:42.635
I told you 100 times I don't
know who hung that coon.

20:42.669 --> 20:47.474
Oh, I believe you.
I ally do.

20:47.508 --> 20:53.013
The thing is though, I gotta be sure.

20:59.420 --> 21:01.788
What the hell are you doing?

21:12.298 --> 21:14.499
<i>Voila, madame.
Enjoy.</i>

21:14.533 --> 21:18.402
<i>A la prochaine.
Bon soir.</i>

21:19.605 --> 21:21.739
Marguerite.

21:27.912 --> 21:29.546
Yes, madame Jeunet.

21:29.581 --> 21:31.482
I will require you
this evening.

21:31.516 --> 21:32.750
You must stay.

21:32.784 --> 21:35.518
I'll need to make arrangements
for the children.

21:35.553 --> 21:38.154
Rosalie... she did not
have children.

21:38.188 --> 21:40.988
- Yes, ma'am.
- Monsieur Thompson...

21:41.023 --> 21:44.757
tonight it is
his birthday celebration.

21:44.791 --> 21:48.359
You will deliver to miss
Danziger this dress,

21:48.394 --> 21:50.295
to Babette's, the nightclub.

21:50.329 --> 21:52.897
- Miss Danziger?
- The paramour.

21:52.931 --> 21:55.566
What is it? The sweetheart of Mr.
Thompson.

21:55.600 --> 21:57.067
Yes, of course.

21:57.101 --> 21:58.968
You will be there
to Babette's by 10:00,

21:59.002 --> 22:03.738
and then you shall wait until after
miss Danziger does the surprise.

22:03.773 --> 22:07.509
The silk fringe, the beading...
it is very delicate,

22:07.543 --> 22:10.412
so you must assist her
in putting it on.

22:10.446 --> 22:13.413
- Very important.
- Yes, ma'am.

22:13.447 --> 22:17.149
You mentioned I must wait until
after miss Danziger's surprise.

22:17.183 --> 22:19.151
- What surprise is that?
- I don't know.

22:19.185 --> 22:22.120
This is why it is the surprise.

22:22.154 --> 22:25.323
<i>Bonjour, madame.</i>

22:27.092 --> 22:29.492
You wanna branch out,
that's Jake with me,

22:29.527 --> 22:31.995
so long as it puts
money in my pocket.

22:32.029 --> 22:36.699
But what I don't need at any
price is a fuckin' headache.

22:36.733 --> 22:38.600
I'm gonna straighten
it out, I promise.

22:38.635 --> 22:41.169
How? By smackin' around bartenders
for the next six months?

22:41.204 --> 22:44.672
<i>This fuckin' Sheridan
is a pain in my ass.</i>

22:44.706 --> 22:47.241
I'm gonna talk to him, John,
soon as he gets here...

22:47.275 --> 22:48.676
work out an accommodation.

22:48.710 --> 22:50.944
Believe me, you're gonna
be rolling in it.

22:50.978 --> 22:52.478
I'm going.

22:52.513 --> 22:54.913
I got a plantas wart
on my foot.

22:54.948 --> 22:57.616
It hurts like a son of a bitch.

22:59.586 --> 23:01.186
You see that?

23:01.221 --> 23:03.522
'Cause he knows
I can handle it.

23:03.556 --> 23:05.724
Or maybe he actually
has a plantar's wart.

23:05.759 --> 23:09.160
Don't be jealous 'cause
I'm moving up, pal.

23:09.195 --> 23:10.561
I got big coattails.

23:10.595 --> 23:13.197
I move up, you're coming
along for the ride.

23:13.231 --> 23:16.532
You got me all wrong.
I'm just passing through.

23:18.068 --> 23:19.867
- It's them.
- Some free advice:

23:19.902 --> 23:21.435
You don't invade
a country all at once.

23:21.470 --> 23:23.438
<i>You take it over one piece at a time.</i>

23:23.472 --> 23:26.240
<i>Act nice, negotiate for a portion.</i>

23:26.274 --> 23:28.842
A couple months you expand.
Then before you know it,

23:28.877 --> 23:31.378
you're controlling
his entire territory.

23:35.249 --> 23:38.417
- Mr. Sheridan?
- Who the fuck are you?

23:38.452 --> 23:41.286
Al Capone.
This is Jimmy Darmody.

23:41.321 --> 23:42.854
Where the fuck's Torrio?

23:42.889 --> 23:46.490
Mr. Torrio sends
his regrets.

23:46.524 --> 23:48.725
He had some pressing
business to attend to.

23:48.759 --> 23:50.193
What does he call this?

23:50.228 --> 23:52.462
He says you should talk to me.

23:52.496 --> 23:54.197
I gotta say this is
very insulting.

23:54.231 --> 23:55.865
I come all the way
down here in the snow.

23:55.899 --> 23:57.533
Trolley's ain't even running.

23:57.567 --> 24:02.037
- Can we offer you anything?
Some coffee, some whiskey? - No.

24:13.849 --> 24:17.683
Forget California.
Today I'm heading east.

24:17.718 --> 24:21.252
- Chinatown.
- I'll see you later, okay?

24:27.058 --> 24:29.226
So how's the Greek fella?

24:29.260 --> 24:32.061
Probably at the dentist getting the
shoe leather out of his chops.

24:32.095 --> 24:34.696
That fella gotta
learn some manners.

24:34.731 --> 24:36.464
I'd say a lot of fellas do.

24:36.499 --> 24:38.500
What, are you talking
about me, pally?

24:38.534 --> 24:41.836
Mr. Sheridan, we asked you down
here to work out a compromise.

24:41.870 --> 24:45.372
The way that we see it, Greektown
is big enough for all of us.

24:45.406 --> 24:47.474
You New York fellas
make me laugh.

24:47.508 --> 24:49.575
You come out here from
Brooklyn or wherever the fuck

24:49.610 --> 24:51.343
and you act like
you own the town.

24:51.378 --> 24:54.546
- He's from Jersey.
- I don't give a fuck where he's from, boyo.

24:54.581 --> 24:55.847
He's in Chicago now.

24:55.882 --> 24:57.983
Mr. Sheridan, I didn't
mean any disrespect.

24:58.017 --> 25:00.485
- The point is is that we have ambition...
- The point is this:

25:00.519 --> 25:03.320
You stay the fuck out of Greektown
or there's gonna be trouble.

25:03.354 --> 25:05.222
We're ready
in Greektown, Sonny.

25:05.256 --> 25:08.124
We've been in Greektown
since Colosimo took over.

25:08.158 --> 25:11.327
Maybe you didn't hear,
but Colosimo retired

25:11.361 --> 25:13.828
on account of that bullet
in his fuckin' head.

25:13.863 --> 25:16.797
Johnny Torrio,
also from Brooklyn...

25:16.831 --> 25:20.399
he runs things now and he's
taking over your territory.

25:28.106 --> 25:30.773
And what?
There's no room for negotiation?

25:30.807 --> 25:32.741
There might be.

25:32.775 --> 25:35.043
Well, how's about he take
a piece of my action?

25:35.078 --> 25:37.780
How much?

25:37.814 --> 25:39.982
10%.

25:40.017 --> 25:41.518
25.

25:43.788 --> 25:45.789
All right, fine.

25:47.258 --> 25:48.858
Let's call it 50.

25:50.427 --> 25:52.628
50?

25:52.662 --> 25:54.363
You heard me.

25:57.500 --> 25:59.335
I don't want any trouble, okay?

25:59.369 --> 26:02.672
Tell Torrio he gets
what he wants.

26:15.016 --> 26:17.984
Fuckin' loudmouth.
I knew he'd cave.

26:19.786 --> 26:22.221
That's one way of reading it.

26:35.066 --> 26:38.467
I was born in Elgin, Texas.

26:38.502 --> 26:40.803
My daddy taught himself
the carpenter trade

26:40.837 --> 26:43.605
doing for the black folk there.

26:43.639 --> 26:47.975
And I tell you, anything
that man put his hand to...

26:48.009 --> 26:54.913
table, chair, wedding chest...
he make that wood sing.

26:54.948 --> 27:02.518
Now one day a man, Mr. T.
O. Purcell, come round.

27:02.553 --> 27:09.190
He a white man, own his own
store, a stable, hotel.

27:09.225 --> 27:14.629
<i>He say to my daddy, "I hears you
the finest carpenter in Elgin."</i>

27:14.664 --> 27:18.601
My daddy tell him, "well, I
can't say one way or the other,

27:18.636 --> 27:22.972
but I knows a bit
about somethin'."

27:23.006 --> 27:25.941
So Mr. T.O. Purcell
take my daddy

27:25.975 --> 27:30.145
to this house he was building...
biggest house in town.

27:30.179 --> 27:35.148
They walk in there, say, "this
here gonna be the library.

27:35.183 --> 27:37.783
What you think
'bout that?"

27:37.818 --> 27:44.189
My daddy say, "Well, I thinks
you need some bookcases."

27:44.223 --> 27:47.459
"Well then, that's what
I want you to make me."

27:47.493 --> 27:50.528
<i>10 month my daddy
work there.</i>

27:50.562 --> 27:55.432
And then when he finished,
he bring me round.

27:55.466 --> 27:58.234
"Mr. Purcell,
this here my boy.

27:58.269 --> 28:00.203
I'd like to show him
what I done."

28:00.237 --> 28:04.772
"Well, come on in
through the front door."

28:04.807 --> 28:07.174
Just like that.

28:07.209 --> 28:09.242
<i>And we did.</i>

28:09.277 --> 28:11.644
<i>When I seen
them bookcases</i>

28:11.678 --> 28:19.685
all carved with scroll and
flowers, baskets of fruit,

28:19.720 --> 28:24.223
little angels floating
in the corner,

28:24.257 --> 28:28.293
that was the most beautiful
thing I ever seen.

28:29.728 --> 28:34.932
About a month later
another man come round.

28:34.966 --> 28:38.468
"I seen what you did
for T.O.

28:38.503 --> 28:41.838
<i>I can't let
that old dog top me.</i>

28:41.872 --> 28:45.407
<i>You come round my house and
I'll show you what I need."</i>

28:45.441 --> 28:49.978
My daddy go with him
to the edge of town.

28:52.281 --> 28:59.419
Wasn't nothing there but six
white men, 12' of rope,

28:59.453 --> 29:03.790
and the pepper tree
they hung him from.

29:19.837 --> 29:23.039
These here are my daddy tools.

29:32.681 --> 29:36.116
What are you gonna
do with them?

29:36.151 --> 29:43.789
Well...
I ain't buildin' no bookcase.

29:49.728 --> 29:54.231
<i>And now for your
edification and enjoyment,</i>

29:54.265 --> 29:57.934
<i>we take you
to ancient Rome.</i>

30:16.450 --> 30:19.819
<i>Witness the
ritual bathing of Aurelia,</i>

30:19.853 --> 30:23.456
<i>mother of the great
emperor Julius Caesar.</i>

30:29.596 --> 30:33.464
<i>Behold her palace slaves
who have no choice</i>

30:33.499 --> 30:38.234
<i>but to submit to her
every imperial wish.</i>

30:57.718 --> 30:59.819
It wasn't the Klan.

30:59.853 --> 31:03.655
- How do you know?
- He told me.

31:03.689 --> 31:05.790
And you believe him?

31:07.526 --> 31:11.495
There's a pot which if a man
still sticks to his story,

31:11.529 --> 31:14.597
that's a man that's
telling you the truth.

31:16.100 --> 31:19.135
We passed that point
about 10 minutes ago.

31:22.305 --> 31:25.173
<i>Surprise!</i>

31:28.210 --> 31:31.312
Oh my God!
What?

31:31.346 --> 31:33.814
I had no idea.

32:00.738 --> 32:03.272
What do you tell a woman
with two black eyes?

32:03.306 --> 32:04.739
Nothing.

32:04.774 --> 32:06.774
She's already
been told... twice.

32:06.808 --> 32:09.777
Now that's
one way to deny 'em the vote.

32:09.811 --> 32:13.680
- I thought you were all for that, senator.
- I am... on the record.

32:13.715 --> 32:15.015
So long as they vote republican.

32:15.049 --> 32:16.616
We democrats fee the same way.

32:16.650 --> 32:18.217
May that never fucking happen.

32:18.252 --> 32:20.353
It is happening, boys.

32:20.387 --> 32:22.287
32 states already ratified?

32:22.322 --> 32:24.122
Those suffragettes
did their job.

32:24.157 --> 32:26.791
I think they all need
a good rogering.

32:26.826 --> 32:29.160
- Right, dearie?
- I know I do.

32:29.194 --> 32:32.062
It's nothing to be afraid of.
You just gotta give 'em what they want.

32:32.097 --> 32:34.331
- Who knows what that is?
- It doesn't matter.

32:34.366 --> 32:36.433
Women don't have
the mind for politics.

32:36.467 --> 32:38.335
You're assuming
they have minds at all.

32:38.369 --> 32:40.537
I have brains, you know.

32:40.571 --> 32:42.205
- Buttercup...
- No no, let her speak.

32:42.239 --> 32:44.173
Let the little lady be heard.

32:44.208 --> 32:47.376
Please, angel, tell us your
thoughts on the league of nations.

32:47.410 --> 32:49.144
- The what?
- The...

32:49.178 --> 32:51.279
<i>The league of nations.</i>

32:51.313 --> 32:54.115
There was a big meeting
in Paris three weeks ago.

32:54.149 --> 32:57.584
Well, I don't know
about that league thing,

32:57.619 --> 33:00.620
but Paris sure sounds swell.

33:01.855 --> 33:04.090
You wanna take me, daddy?

33:04.124 --> 33:06.492
Now there's a thinking woman.

33:06.526 --> 33:10.229
- Go get me a fresh one, okay?
- Okay, baby.

33:14.167 --> 33:16.167
Perhaps she's not
the best example.

33:17.836 --> 33:22.039
Relax, will ya? I've been dealing
with mugs like this my whole life.

33:22.073 --> 33:23.506
I asked around, Al.

33:23.541 --> 33:25.942
This Sheridan
is a serious fella.

33:25.976 --> 33:29.211
No offense, but these micks...
they come on strong,

33:29.245 --> 33:31.012
but it's just
the booze talking.

33:31.047 --> 33:34.215
Now if they were Sicilian,
they'd be a different story.

33:34.249 --> 33:35.783
<i>Gentlemen?</i>

33:35.817 --> 33:38.018
We're ready for you.

33:38.053 --> 33:40.020
I gotta say thanks, pal.

33:40.054 --> 33:41.622
I know this can't be cheap.

33:41.656 --> 33:44.691
Springing for
some new threads? Eh.

33:44.725 --> 33:46.693
Well, it's mighty white of you.

33:46.727 --> 33:50.462
A little fruity,
but we're businessmen, right?

33:50.497 --> 33:52.297
Gotta look the part.

33:54.133 --> 33:56.333
You get that over there?

33:57.235 --> 33:58.869
The meuse-argonne.

33:58.903 --> 34:01.771
It's been killing me lately.

34:01.805 --> 34:05.540
Them heinies...
cut us both up, huh?

34:05.575 --> 34:08.609
- Lousy bastards.
- Right.

34:14.616 --> 34:18.819
The slim cut...
very a la mode.

34:18.853 --> 34:20.553
That means
"right on the money."

34:20.587 --> 34:25.156
The wide shoulders... a
very masculine silhouette.

34:26.391 --> 34:28.858
What does the gentleman think?

34:31.228 --> 34:33.563
Wife's gonna shit.

34:51.347 --> 34:54.349
Yes, please. Keep it coming.
That's right.

35:42.223 --> 35:43.690
Mrs. Schroeder,
welcome.

35:43.724 --> 35:45.891
Mr. Thompson.
Happy Birthday.

35:45.925 --> 35:47.425
Oh, why thank you.

35:47.459 --> 35:51.494
Oh, I'm to deliver
this gown to miss Danziger.

35:51.528 --> 35:53.128
Oh, of course.

35:53.162 --> 35:55.129
I'll put it
in the dressing room for you.

35:56.298 --> 36:00.468
I trust Isabelle
is treating you all right?

36:00.502 --> 36:03.905
Madame Jeunet?
Yes, she is.

36:03.939 --> 36:05.573
Is that what
she makes you call her?

36:05.607 --> 36:09.209
Well, there's the birthday boy.

36:09.243 --> 36:10.977
Enjoying yourself, Walter?

36:11.011 --> 36:13.546
I'll soldier on as best I can.

36:13.580 --> 36:17.216
May I present senator Walter
Edge <i>up from Washington,</i>

36:17.250 --> 36:19.751
<i>and the honorable Frank Hague,
Mayor of Jersey city?</i>

36:19.785 --> 36:21.552
Gentlemen,
Mrs. Margaret Schroeder.

36:21.587 --> 36:23.054
- Mrs. Schroeder.
- Ma'am.

36:23.088 --> 36:25.222
<i>- A pleasure, I'm sure.
- May I get you a drink?</i>

36:25.257 --> 36:28.592
- Whiskey, gin? - Thank you, no.
I don't drink.

36:28.626 --> 36:30.093
<i>Mrs. Schroeder
is a member</i>

36:30.128 --> 36:31.928
of the women's
temperance league.

36:31.962 --> 36:34.130
Oh.

36:34.164 --> 36:35.898
A fine organization.

36:35.932 --> 36:37.866
It is.

36:39.502 --> 36:42.636
Well, I guess I stepped in it, huh?

36:42.671 --> 36:44.404
You're not a suffragette, I hope.

36:44.439 --> 36:47.640
- Not officially at least.
- Ah, another one, eh?

36:47.675 --> 36:51.911
I come from a country where women
already have the right to vote.

36:51.945 --> 36:53.779
In fact, in most
civilized countries

36:53.814 --> 36:55.747
<i>women are afforded
that privilege.</i>

36:55.782 --> 36:58.617
Well, in this country
we're simply trying

36:58.651 --> 37:01.586
to protect women from
the hard truths of life.

37:01.620 --> 37:05.422
By denying them the right to
take a meaningful part in it?

37:05.456 --> 37:07.357
It's a shame
you see it that way.

37:07.391 --> 37:08.858
Oh, it isn't just me, sir.

37:08.892 --> 37:11.894
It's most women who'd
like the right to vote.

37:11.928 --> 37:16.297
And as you've learned, if you withhold
from a woman something she deeply desires,

37:16.331 --> 37:19.933
then she'll surely find a way to
withhold something that you desire.

37:19.968 --> 37:23.170
- And what might that be?
- Alcohol.

37:25.306 --> 37:26.773
Well, now, they haven't done

37:26.807 --> 37:28.474
a very good job of it,
now have they?

37:28.509 --> 37:30.576
Well now, the party's
only just started.

37:30.610 --> 37:34.079
Walter, I think
you've met your match.

37:34.114 --> 37:36.681
Mrs. Schroeder, I'll see you
to the dressing room.

37:36.716 --> 37:39.050
- Gentlemen.
- Ma'am.

37:39.084 --> 37:42.752
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
miss Edith day.</i>

37:48.992 --> 37:51.994
I hope you're not offended
by all the drinking.

37:52.028 --> 37:54.931
- Old habits die hard.
- If they die at all.

37:54.965 --> 37:56.833
Well, that's a very
practical perspective.

37:56.867 --> 37:59.101
I'm a very practical woman.

37:59.136 --> 38:02.271
Well then, I suppose
we should dance.

40:47.339 --> 40:49.506
What about the other one?
Uh, Jimmy.

40:49.540 --> 40:53.075
We don't cater
to poofs, fellas.

40:53.109 --> 40:56.111
He recommended
one of the girls.

40:56.145 --> 40:59.013
I forget her name.

41:00.382 --> 41:02.916
Pearl probably.

41:04.752 --> 41:07.320
Yes yes.

41:07.354 --> 41:09.555
That's her.

41:19.064 --> 41:23.467
Gotta face facts, Nuck...
we have a democrat for governor now.

41:23.501 --> 41:25.569
These matters
have to be finessed.

41:25.603 --> 41:27.103
And in the meantime, what?

41:27.138 --> 41:29.005
<i>I lose my road money
to Frank?</i>

41:29.039 --> 41:30.773
People up north
don't need roads?

41:30.807 --> 41:33.242
- Actually, Frank, they don't.
- Relax, boys.

41:33.276 --> 41:36.611
- There's plenty of dough for everyone.
- Well, I'll take mine now.

41:36.646 --> 41:39.047
There are limits,
Nucky. Jesus.

41:39.081 --> 41:41.315
You can't expect
to have everything.

41:41.350 --> 41:44.018
Is that what I told you when I put
you in the governor's mansion?

41:44.052 --> 41:45.786
- Nucky...
- And in the senate?

41:45.820 --> 41:47.420
Have I not thanked you enough?

41:47.455 --> 41:50.056
You were the best campaign
manager I've ever seen...

41:50.090 --> 41:51.657
hell, that ever was...

41:51.691 --> 41:54.992
but you've got to understand
this is complicated.

41:55.027 --> 41:57.527
I've got hotels
that no one can get to

41:57.562 --> 41:59.795
except by stinking train
because the roads

41:59.830 --> 42:02.097
to Atlantic City
are rivers of fucking mud.

42:02.131 --> 42:04.865
<i>We need paved highways
so cars can come and go.</i>

42:04.900 --> 42:07.801
So cars can come and go...
is that what you're worried about?

42:07.835 --> 42:10.036
- And trucks.
- Trucks full of liquor.

42:10.070 --> 42:11.972
What's that,
lemonade in your hand?

42:12.006 --> 42:15.744
- I'm just proposing we call a spade a spade.
- Fine. How's this?

42:15.778 --> 42:18.480
You don't need the road money up
north and you fucking know it.

42:18.515 --> 42:21.950
- The people of Jersey city need highways
just as... - Jersey city my balls.

42:21.985 --> 42:24.585
You're looking for a payoff
so you'll back the fuck away.

42:24.620 --> 42:27.721
So why not save us all time
and give me a number?

42:31.158 --> 42:33.125
I'll need to do
some calculations.

42:33.159 --> 42:36.193
Fine. Finally.

42:36.227 --> 42:39.362
- You fucking democrats, boy.
- Now now.

42:39.396 --> 42:42.897
Let's not let party politics
affect what's best for the people.

42:42.932 --> 42:45.900
Jesus, Walter, have you packed
for the white house already?

42:45.934 --> 42:51.574
No, but when
I'm there, maybe I can help you

42:51.608 --> 42:54.610
by controlling
governor Edwards.

42:55.679 --> 42:57.580
"Maybe."

42:57.614 --> 43:02.117
Oh now, let's not let our best
days be behind us, shall we?

43:06.055 --> 43:09.556
I'm through
with this champagne.

43:11.292 --> 43:13.426
What's your pleasure, senator?

43:13.461 --> 43:16.629
I'll have a Pimm's cup.

43:16.663 --> 43:19.632
Eddie.

43:19.666 --> 43:21.133
I am so sorry.

43:21.168 --> 43:23.302
We have no Pimm's cup tonight.

43:23.336 --> 43:25.770
- What do you mean?
- There is no Pimm's.

43:25.805 --> 43:28.439
Name anything else, senator.

43:29.908 --> 43:34.277
Well...
I'll have a Brandy.

43:34.312 --> 43:36.179
<i>Ja.</i>

43:36.213 --> 43:38.181
Why, is there no Pimm's?

43:38.215 --> 43:39.815
Easy, will you?

43:39.850 --> 43:44.886
Like I said, you can't
expect to have everything.

43:44.920 --> 43:47.188
Hmm?

43:57.797 --> 43:59.932
You all set?

43:59.967 --> 44:01.667
What's your hurry?

44:01.702 --> 44:03.669
This ain't a love story, bub.

44:06.105 --> 44:09.307
<i>You're nice, classy.</i>

44:09.341 --> 44:11.075
<i>You don't even seem
like a whore.</i>

44:11.109 --> 44:12.342
Thanks.

44:12.377 --> 44:15.979
Your friend there, Jimmy...
he got good taste.

44:16.013 --> 44:19.482
I'll pass on the compliment.

44:22.119 --> 44:23.719
Come here.

44:27.023 --> 44:29.156
I gotta get back downstairs.

44:29.190 --> 44:31.091
Let me look at you.

44:31.125 --> 44:34.294
Something to remember you by.

44:49.174 --> 44:53.544
- No kissing.
- No, I know.

44:53.578 --> 44:57.747
Jesus, you're like
a fucking angel.

45:32.010 --> 45:34.544
Yeah, okay.
Come on, let's go.

45:34.579 --> 45:37.313
<i>You ready for tonight, huh?</i>

46:07.438 --> 46:10.340
I need a pack of smokes
and a paper.

46:13.343 --> 46:15.077
I'd have loved
to have been there.

46:15.111 --> 46:17.779
I just didn't think you'd want this
kind of news on your birthday.

46:17.814 --> 46:20.381
I don't want it the day
after my birthday either.

46:20.416 --> 46:22.583
I didn't know he'd take
that fella's finger, Nuck.

46:22.618 --> 46:23.951
Ahem.

46:27.989 --> 46:30.057
For your signature.

46:31.526 --> 46:33.693
Senator Edge ran up quite a bill.

46:33.728 --> 46:35.361
$1800?

46:35.396 --> 46:38.397
He said to thank you
for a wonderful time.

46:43.469 --> 46:47.038
<i>Do I return the
Klan guy's ring?</i>

46:47.072 --> 46:49.773
<i>Or is that adding
insult to injury?</i>

47:04.954 --> 47:06.254
How's she doing?

47:06.288 --> 47:08.189
The doctor's
given her a sedative.

47:08.223 --> 47:10.190
Can't I see her?

47:10.225 --> 47:13.426
She needs to sleep, kiddo.

47:13.461 --> 47:16.328
Is it bad?

47:16.363 --> 47:18.097
Go on.

47:18.131 --> 47:20.699
I'll put these in a vase.

47:42.484 --> 47:44.452
Cheer up.

47:44.486 --> 47:47.988
It happened to me.
I'm still beautiful.

47:49.957 --> 47:51.424
It wasn't me made a muck of it.

47:51.459 --> 47:53.126
You dopes killed
the wrong coon.

47:53.160 --> 47:56.262
- He drives a Packard you said.
- But it wasn't Chalky.

47:56.296 --> 47:57.763
You hung a fella works for him.

47:57.797 --> 47:59.631
He got the message, didn't he?

47:59.666 --> 48:01.533
He probably crapped
his drawers.

48:01.568 --> 48:03.135
Then why is he still
operational?

48:03.169 --> 48:05.937
It was your idea in the first place.
How should we know?

48:05.971 --> 48:08.873
Where's our dough anyways?
I need a new topcoat.

48:08.907 --> 48:11.608
- Which brother is this now?
- Teo.

48:11.643 --> 48:15.879
Teo, Leo, Ignacious.

48:15.913 --> 48:17.880
What are youse,
all named after popes?

48:19.149 --> 48:21.150
What of it?
You don't like God or somethin'?

48:21.184 --> 48:22.584
Whoa, take it easy.

48:22.618 --> 48:25.019
7,000 clams, Mickey.

48:25.054 --> 48:26.654
Where's our fuckin' money?

48:26.688 --> 48:30.090
Okay okay.

48:30.125 --> 48:31.725
I'll get it.

48:34.228 --> 48:35.762
From where?

48:42.135 --> 48:44.302
What do you say
I get you a deal

48:44.336 --> 48:46.571
put three grand
in your pockets?

48:46.605 --> 48:48.706
Yeah, I'm listening.

48:48.740 --> 48:50.841
Nucky Thompson.

48:50.875 --> 48:53.443
One of his ward bosses
makes a nice fat collection

48:53.477 --> 48:55.778
by the Ritz every Friday.

48:55.813 --> 48:58.881
- Nucky's joint?
- Nucky's money.

48:58.915 --> 49:02.083
It's candy from a baby, I tell ya.

49:02.118 --> 49:04.018
All right, you dope out a plan.

49:04.052 --> 49:06.787
But you botch it up,
my brother's gonna give you

49:06.822 --> 49:09.423
a haircut you'll never forget.

49:23.402 --> 49:25.336
What's this?

49:25.370 --> 49:27.271
From Nucky Thompson.

50:16.280 --> 50:17.881
Waiting for someone?

50:20.050 --> 50:21.817
Yeah, actually.

50:21.852 --> 50:25.220
I've been waitin' to see you.

50:25.254 --> 50:30.358
Here I am.
What do you want?

50:34.028 --> 50:36.296
Cat got your tongue?

50:36.330 --> 50:39.298
You've been following me
around for days.

50:39.333 --> 50:41.233
You must have some idea.

50:42.769 --> 50:46.038
I think you already
know what I want.

50:46.072 --> 50:50.708
No, dear.
I only know what I want.

51:13.361 --> 51:16.196
Meet me here
after the last show.

51:41.785 --> 51:44.619
- Madame Jeunet?
- One minute.

52:09.041 --> 52:11.442
<i>Yes? What is it?</i>

52:11.476 --> 52:13.477
Oh.

52:13.511 --> 52:15.378
I'm done.

52:15.413 --> 52:17.880

52:17.915 --> 52:19.615
Yes, ma'am.

52:41.301 --> 52:42.901
