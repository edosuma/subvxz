What the drip?

00:52.611 --> 00:53.627
(squeaking)

00:53.721 --> 00:55.036
Aah! Leakin' Lucy Lawless!

00:55.056 --> 00:57.447
Aah! What's going on?
Why are you naked?

00:57.541 --> 00:58.390
Why is there water?

00:58.542 --> 00:59.892
-Got to grab my tools!
-Wolf, no!

01:00.119 --> 01:01.209
Let's call a plumber.

01:01.228 --> 01:02.803
The Bobcat's got this one
under control.

01:02.897 --> 01:04.396
I'm trying Bobcat out
as a nickname.

01:04.548 --> 01:05.731
Is it too many animals?

01:05.882 --> 01:07.215
This feels like a situation
for a real plumber,

01:07.309 --> 01:08.959
with a regular name,
like Champ. No.

01:08.977 --> 01:09.902
Gerb. Wait.

01:10.053 --> 01:11.403
Why can't I think
of a regular name?

01:11.630 --> 01:13.555
Don't worry, babe,
you don't need Gerb

01:13.574 --> 01:14.798
when you got the B-Cat.

01:14.817 --> 01:16.316
-Aah!
-Oh, no, no! Toilet juice!

01:16.468 --> 01:18.819
Thanks again for letting us
crash in your room, Ham.

01:18.971 --> 01:20.804
Our toilet's being
a real nasty freak.

01:20.823 --> 01:23.415
-She really is.
-Well, we're all so excited
for you and Honeybee

01:23.642 --> 01:25.918
to be sleeping over in the main
house during Thanksgiving week.

01:26.145 --> 01:28.253
I'll be perfectly happy
on Moon's floor.

01:28.405 --> 01:30.071
Did somebody say Boyz Night?

01:30.132 --> 01:32.983
I said it with a "Z," so I think
it's gonna be pretty fun.

01:33.001 --> 01:34.818
Oh, Ham,
you've got a lot of books.

01:34.911 --> 01:36.002
I can get some reading done.

01:36.155 --> 01:37.912
<i> Chunky Chili</i>
<i> for the Teenage Soul,</i>

01:37.932 --> 01:39.747
some Mary Higgins Clark...

01:39.767 --> 01:40.915
<i> The Hacking Halvorsons?</i>

01:40.935 --> 01:42.083
Oh, yeah, we all read those.

01:42.103 --> 01:43.435
They're
about this Viking family.

01:43.662 --> 01:45.329
<i> Very</i> violent
but also very close.

01:45.347 --> 01:48.440
And they love cutting
the heads off of things.

01:48.592 --> 01:50.109
Like, any head,
they'll just cut it off.

01:50.260 --> 01:52.002
Even if they're busy.
They don't mind.

01:52.095 --> 01:53.112
JUDY:
Well, you guys picked

01:53.263 --> 01:54.929
a great time
to destroy your toilet

01:54.949 --> 01:57.357
with the power of poop, because
I have a new shadow puppet

01:57.509 --> 01:58.817
I'm debuting after dinner.

01:58.969 --> 02:01.194
I have to dislocate my thumb
to do it, but it's worth it.

02:01.347 --> 02:02.512
I like a shadow puppet.

02:02.606 --> 02:04.439
Sometimes a regular puppet
is just too much.

02:04.458 --> 02:07.200
Well, the plumber's out of town
for the Thanksgiving holiday,

02:07.353 --> 02:09.202
but he'll fix the toilet
first thing Monday morning.

02:09.296 --> 02:11.705
In the meantime, having
all you here under one roof

02:11.799 --> 02:13.948
will be fun, like when you guys
were little kids.

02:14.042 --> 02:16.635
Except one of my sons
is married.

02:16.786 --> 02:18.303
Moon is married?

02:18.455 --> 02:19.954
Oh, Wolf. Right.

02:19.974 --> 02:21.140
<i> WOLF:</i>
<i> Okay, so, I took the liberty</i>

02:21.367 --> 02:22.866
of whipping up
a new chore chart and...

02:22.959 --> 02:24.792
Uh, Wolf,
Ham is the chore chief now,

02:24.812 --> 02:26.219
so he assigns the workload.

02:26.313 --> 02:29.148
You had a great run, Wolf,
but it's Ham's time now.

02:29.299 --> 02:32.058
Fine. I'll stand down
and await the chief's orders.

02:32.153 --> 02:34.378
-Um, Wolf?
-(chuckles): Am I sweeping?

02:34.396 --> 02:37.138
Oh, wow. Well, then let me
just set the broom down here

02:37.232 --> 02:39.065
against the, uh,
the wall over here...

02:39.160 --> 02:40.901
HAM:
You're still sweeping.

02:41.053 --> 02:42.810
I'm excited
we're gonna be roommates again

02:42.830 --> 02:44.054
for a whole week.

02:44.147 --> 02:45.889
We can play all the games
we used to play,

02:45.908 --> 02:49.059
-like Overworked Cashier
and Surly Customer, and...
-HAM: Sorry, Moon.

02:49.077 --> 02:50.727
That sounds fun,
but I really need to focus

02:50.746 --> 02:52.746
on finding something
in this Michigan cookbook

02:52.898 --> 02:55.007
to make for Crispin
and his parents at Thanksgiving.

02:55.234 --> 02:56.842
Wouldn't the kitchen be
a better place for this?

02:57.069 --> 02:58.752
Yeah, I tried, but Wolf
kept cleaning up my ingredients

02:58.846 --> 03:01.162
-before I could use them.
-Why don't you take a break

03:01.182 --> 03:02.997
and we can play
Monster Brothers?

03:03.091 --> 03:05.166
Remember, we'd get
into Mom's old fur coats

03:05.260 --> 03:06.834
and run around the house
scaring everybody?

03:06.929 --> 03:08.470
I can't.
I got to figure this out.

03:08.580 --> 03:10.931
Damn it! I don't know
what "Detroit-style" means.

03:11.083 --> 03:13.192
Do I put a little car on it?

03:14.086 --> 03:16.586
Hey! Who's in the mood
for some Jude?

03:16.721 --> 03:17.863
I know<i> I</i> am.

03:18.090 --> 03:19.439
Oh, hey, Alanis.
I can't talk right now.

03:19.533 --> 03:22.183
I have to memorize this poem
from the 14th century by Monday.

03:22.203 --> 03:24.686
"Ye Ballad
of the Sportsman's Horseman."

03:24.780 --> 03:26.038
My English grade is teetering

03:26.189 --> 03:27.614
between an A-minus
and a B-plus right now,

03:27.766 --> 03:29.023
and I can't get a "B."

03:29.117 --> 03:31.359
I would<i> "B"</i> so ashamed
of myself.

03:31.453 --> 03:33.620
-Hmm. But you're fine
with that joke?
-Shh.

03:33.714 --> 03:35.714
No more talking.
I have to memorize this.

03:35.865 --> 03:37.441
Okay.
I can just stand here quietly.

03:37.534 --> 03:39.276
Great. Because I have a system
where I picture

03:39.294 --> 03:40.944
each of the words with boobs
and a big round butt

03:40.963 --> 03:42.462
so I pay attention.

03:42.556 --> 03:44.223
Yeah, nothing keeps your focus
like boobs and butts.

03:44.374 --> 03:46.466
Oh, I know. (clears throat)
"The horseman's corset..."

03:46.560 --> 03:48.543
You know, I used to have
to memorize a lot of lines

03:48.562 --> 03:50.454
for<i> You Can't Do That</i>
<i> on Television.</i>

03:50.472 --> 03:51.638
I thought you said
you were gonna be quiet.

03:51.790 --> 03:53.139
Oh, yes, I am. Starting now.

03:53.292 --> 03:55.567
"The horseman's corset forces
the lord's reinforcements.

03:55.719 --> 03:56.902
"All hurried they run,

03:57.053 --> 03:58.295
"scurrying, worrying, furry,
and slurrying.

03:58.313 --> 04:00.072
"The birds' beaks
peak and screech,

04:00.299 --> 04:02.074
"beseeching and bequeathing
a maiden's teat.

04:02.225 --> 04:03.967
"The sport is upon us
at the court.

04:04.060 --> 04:05.077
The gentleman pats his seat."

04:05.228 --> 04:07.079
(exhales)
Okay, I think I've got it.

04:07.230 --> 04:09.748
-"Horseman's corset forces..."
-Horsey borshy porshy deroshy...

04:09.941 --> 04:11.491
-Alanis!
-What? I'm helping!

04:11.643 --> 04:13.752
-Please! Shh!
"All hurried they run..."
-Bleep, bloop, blorp...

04:13.979 --> 04:15.996
Oh, my God!
Why are you acting like this?

04:16.148 --> 04:17.481
Technically,
I'm your imagination, Judy,

04:17.499 --> 04:18.924
so you're doing this
to yourself.

04:19.151 --> 04:20.908
-I'm going inside.
-Miss you.

04:20.928 --> 04:22.986
-(loud whirring)
-Testing out the new vacuum!

04:23.005 --> 04:24.671
Boy, she handles like a dream!

04:24.765 --> 04:26.080
Wolf, I need to work!

04:26.100 --> 04:28.341
Wolf! I gave Judy
vacuuming duties!

04:28.435 --> 04:31.436
You guys weren't kidding--
those Halvorsons really do hack.

04:31.588 --> 04:34.180
-(growls)
-Oh, sick! Monster Brothers!

04:34.275 --> 04:36.108
Monster Brother, singular!

04:36.259 --> 04:38.277
Someone's too busy
to play with me.

04:38.428 --> 04:41.004
-(whirring stops)
-Will you all please
get out of my room?

04:41.023 --> 04:43.006
I really have to memorize
this poem.

04:43.025 --> 04:44.024
Oh, I can help. All right.

04:44.176 --> 04:45.842
What you need is
a mnemonic device.

04:45.935 --> 04:47.344
"Horseman's corset."

04:47.362 --> 04:49.288
Okay, so just say,
"Courseman's horse-it."

04:49.439 --> 04:51.939
-Now you'll never forget.
-Okay, I need some privacy.

04:52.034 --> 04:54.293

-I do. Everyone is annoying.

-Yep. Uh-huh.
-That's right.
-HAM: Correct.

05:43.585 --> 05:46.236
Ah, I see. Well, I usually save
this for Thanksgiving dinner,

05:46.254 --> 05:48.663
but why don't we go around
and say what we're thankful for

05:48.682 --> 05:50.090
-right now?
-Sure.

05:50.184 --> 05:52.667

how to do things properly!

06:03.922 --> 06:06.198
-Guys...
-Ham, I'm<i> so</i> thankful

06:06.425 --> 06:08.141
that you moved into my room

06:08.293 --> 06:10.869
and now I'm seeing less of you
than ever before.

06:11.020 --> 06:12.204
All right, enough.

06:12.431 --> 06:14.039
I understand sarcasm.
You can all stop now.

06:14.266 --> 06:15.707
-Oh, can we, Dad?
-Oh, good.
-Oh, thank you, Father.

06:15.934 --> 06:17.358
-Can we stop now?
-I'll never stop.
-I'm serious, guys.

06:17.452 --> 06:19.378
What do we need to do
to settle this?

06:19.529 --> 06:21.121
We can do
what the Halvorsons do.

06:21.215 --> 06:23.106
We dig a pit and hit each other
with narwhal bones,

06:23.125 --> 06:25.384
and the last person
to lose consciousness wins.

06:25.611 --> 06:26.885
Instead, why doesn't everyone

06:27.036 --> 06:28.887
turn to the person next to them
and apologize?

06:29.114 --> 06:31.615
OTHERS:
Oh, I'm<i> so</i> sorry.

06:31.633 --> 06:34.284
Okay, never mind.
Let's all just work quietly.

06:34.302 --> 06:37.187
Fine, but if we do need
narwhal bones, I have a guy.

06:39.958 --> 06:42.383
Huh. Where's breakfast?
And where's Dad?

06:42.477 --> 06:44.403
Well, he started
the turkey cooking.

06:46.573 --> 06:47.814
He's not in his room.

06:47.908 --> 06:49.799
Look. Dad's ax is still stuck
in the log,

06:49.818 --> 06:52.969
instead of oiled, wiped down,
and safely put away.

06:53.062 --> 06:55.138
-Oh, my God.
-It can't be.

06:55.157 --> 06:57.323
We haven't done one in years.

06:57.476 --> 06:58.324
It is upon us.

06:58.419 --> 07:00.460
Dad has declared a Beef Hunt!

07:03.498 --> 07:05.982
HONEYBEE: Oh, my God,
is this actually a Beef Hunt?

07:06.075 --> 07:07.909
You know about the Beef Hunt?

07:07.928 --> 07:09.169
Yeah, Wolf told me
that when you were kids,

07:09.263 --> 07:11.337
every Thanksgiving
your dad would send you

07:11.432 --> 07:12.747
on an elaborate hunt to test
your outdoor survival skills.

07:12.766 --> 07:14.507
It's like<i> The Amazing Race</i>
meets<i> Survivor,</i>

07:14.601 --> 07:16.342
but without
a sexy middle-aged host.

07:16.495 --> 07:19.329
-Yup, just a sexy,
middle-aged dad.
-Wolf, no.

07:19.422 --> 07:20.997
The winner gets the Beef Belt

07:21.016 --> 07:23.758
and they get to say the swear
word of their choice at dinner.

07:23.777 --> 07:25.277
When I was ten, I said "taint."

07:25.428 --> 07:27.671
I had no idea what it meant, but
I'll never forget the feeling.

07:27.689 --> 07:29.597
And this is the perfect day
for the competition,

07:29.691 --> 07:30.782
because I'm still furious

07:30.934 --> 07:32.192
none of you guys
let me learn my poem!

07:32.286 --> 07:34.678
It's gonna feel extra nice
when I destroy you all!

07:34.696 --> 07:37.622
Ha-ha! No way. I'm gonna
absolutely smash you guys.

07:37.774 --> 07:39.624
Uh, but respectful.

07:39.776 --> 07:41.126
Respect is for Helen Hunts
and Bonnie Hunts.

07:41.277 --> 07:43.128
-This is the Beef Hunt, damn it!
-Shouldn't you be back

07:43.279 --> 07:45.872
making Michigan hot dog
baked brie blasts for Crispin?

07:46.024 --> 07:47.132
You wish I'd drop out.

07:47.301 --> 07:49.283
I'm gonna Michigan hot dog
baked brie blast you guys

07:49.303 --> 07:52.045
-out of the water.
-Loving the trash talk, guys.

07:52.197 --> 07:53.880
-Where are we running to?
-The big field.

07:54.032 --> 07:55.974
That's where
the first challenge always is.

07:56.125 --> 07:57.809
Ooh. Are there gonna be
booby traps?

07:57.961 --> 07:59.202
-MOON: Aah!
-Moon!

07:59.221 --> 08:00.704
Don't look back--
it's every man or woman

08:00.722 --> 08:02.481
for himself or herself
during the Beef Hunt.

08:02.632 --> 08:04.557
-That's right.
-Moon, you caught up already?

08:04.710 --> 08:06.893
Yeah, I learned a new swear
last month,

08:07.045 --> 08:10.563
and I'm really motivated
to say it out loud.

08:10.716 --> 08:11.973
<i> BEEF:</i>
<i> All right,</i>

08:12.067 --> 08:13.641
clearly Wolf and Honeybee
need their space back,

08:13.735 --> 08:16.811
and in order to get it,
they need this toilet back.

08:16.830 --> 08:19.814
So I am going to fix it.

08:19.941 --> 08:21.500
It's just a toilet.
You use one of these

08:21.651 --> 08:24.628
every four days--
nothing to be afraid of.

08:25.413 --> 08:26.320
Nope.

08:26.414 --> 08:28.673
Huh, looks like
a food challenge.

08:29.325 --> 08:31.234
"This first competition
could be a bit hairy.

08:31.327 --> 08:33.995
To do it you'll each have to eat
ten bowls of cranberry."

08:34.014 --> 08:35.180
What does this have to do
with surviving

08:35.331 --> 08:37.349
in the wild
on the first Thanksgiving?

08:37.576 --> 08:39.909
-(chomping, moaning)
-Oh, you guys
are already eating.

08:39.928 --> 08:41.353
All done! I won!

08:41.522 --> 08:45.339
I get the winner's envelope and
probably some huge advantage.

08:45.359 --> 08:47.675
"Congratulations,
you finished your food.

08:47.694 --> 08:50.253
Now you must wait
for the rest of the brood"?

08:50.346 --> 08:53.014
"When all of your brothers
and sisters are done,

08:53.108 --> 08:55.759
head to the rock
that looks like Danson."

08:55.852 --> 08:58.778
Ugh! I finished first and now
I have to wait for all of you?

08:58.930 --> 09:01.114
-That sucks.
-Who's Dan's son?

09:01.208 --> 09:04.117
No, Ted Danson. We have a rock
that looks just like him.

09:04.269 --> 09:06.119
Ooh! He's
on my famous freebies list!

09:06.271 --> 09:08.529
Wolf, you can't get mad
if I kiss that rock.

09:08.549 --> 09:10.440
You won't be the first.

09:10.458 --> 09:12.217
<i> BEEF: Thanks for coming over</i>
<i> to help me.</i>

09:12.368 --> 09:14.368
That's okay.
I'm going to my daughter's house

09:14.388 --> 09:16.388
for Thanksgiving this year,
so I don't have to cook.

09:16.539 --> 09:18.631
And I never miss a chance
to bowl-browse.

09:18.784 --> 09:20.058
Boy, she ain't much to look at,

09:20.209 --> 09:22.227
but she'll get it done,
am I right?

09:22.378 --> 09:23.469
This all seems pretty simple.

09:23.564 --> 09:24.954
I'm surprised
you can't handle it.

09:25.048 --> 09:26.956
I don't like toilets.
No offense.

09:27.050 --> 09:29.959
I'm not a toilet.
What bugs you about 'em?

09:30.053 --> 09:31.144
That they look
kind of like pelicans,

09:31.296 --> 09:32.737
so when you sit down
it's like you're sitting

09:32.964 --> 09:34.555
-in a pelican's mouth?
-Uh, no.

09:34.649 --> 09:36.983
It was years ago.
I was fixing a toilet,

09:37.135 --> 09:39.077
a pipe burst,
and a very tiny piece of poop

09:39.228 --> 09:41.913
flew through the air
and into my... my mouth!

09:42.065 --> 09:43.915
I spit it out
and gargled with vodka.

09:44.067 --> 09:46.567
Then I googled "full
mouth replacement surgery,"

09:46.587 --> 09:48.569
but they only do it in Romania.

09:48.589 --> 09:50.422
Yeesh! Is that all?
You got your brown wings.

09:50.573 --> 09:52.757
-Happens to me all the time.
-Wait, all the time?

09:52.984 --> 09:54.500
Look, Beef,
I can't do this job for you.

09:54.595 --> 09:56.986
-Why not?
-Because then you'll
always need me to fix it.

09:57.080 --> 09:59.097
You have to face your fear
of the toilet.

09:59.248 --> 10:00.748
-And I'll train you to do it.
-What if,

10:00.767 --> 10:03.993
instead, you fix my toilet,
and I peer over your shoulder

10:04.087 --> 10:06.329
and say, "Ooh, ah, great job"?

10:06.389 --> 10:08.106
No, thanks.
You know I only like compliments

10:08.333 --> 10:10.166
if they're specifically
about my looks.

10:10.185 --> 10:11.835
-You're beautiful.
-Obviously.

10:11.928 --> 10:13.278
But you're still fixing
that toilet.

10:13.505 --> 10:16.948
-There it is!
-That is one handsome
Sam Malone stone.

10:17.100 --> 10:18.341
I feel like I'm at<i> Cheers.</i>

10:18.360 --> 10:20.343
Look. this stack of cards
has my name on it.

10:20.362 --> 10:22.120
-It says I'm supposed to host
a trivia quiz.
-Trivia quiz?

10:22.271 --> 10:24.122
This doesn't sound like Dad
at all.

10:24.349 --> 10:25.624
Maybe he was in a hurry

10:25.775 --> 10:27.274
and downloaded another
family's hunt off the Internet.

10:27.294 --> 10:28.627
Other families
don't do this, guys.

10:28.778 --> 10:30.870
Okay, everybody line up
and make a buzzing noise

10:31.022 --> 10:32.113
if you think
you know the answer.

10:32.132 --> 10:33.706
"Where did Judy put
her Frida Kahlo

10:33.859 --> 10:36.876
and Emily Dickinson dolls
when she was five, and why?"

10:37.028 --> 10:38.619
-Honk! I mean, uh, buzz!
-Wolf!

10:38.713 --> 10:40.530
-Ugh!
-She hid them
in the refrigerator

10:40.548 --> 10:43.049
so they could do their important
work without being subject

10:43.201 --> 10:45.644
to the patriarchal gaze
of Ham's Ninja Turtles.

10:45.795 --> 10:47.720
Correct.
Now I hand you the card.

10:47.873 --> 10:48.980
Question two.

10:49.207 --> 10:50.556
Correct.
Correct.

10:50.709 --> 10:52.633
Oof. That's upsetting,
but it's correct.

10:52.653 --> 10:53.634
Correct.

10:53.654 --> 10:55.211
Okay, last question.

10:55.230 --> 10:57.380
-"This was Moon's favorite snack
when he was four."
-Buzz!

10:57.473 --> 10:59.658
A ham sandwich. And he'd make
aggressive eye contact

10:59.809 --> 11:00.975
with Ham while eating it.

11:00.994 --> 11:02.402
I thought the meat came
from his back.

11:02.496 --> 11:04.904
-Ding-ding-ding!
-Yes! I got the most right!

11:05.056 --> 11:06.572
Suck it!
Give me the winner's envelope.

11:06.667 --> 11:08.574
Ooh, what do I get?
A head start or...?

11:08.727 --> 11:09.742
Eh. This is just a note.

11:09.895 --> 11:11.561
"Winning this round
isn't that hard.

11:11.579 --> 11:13.579
Take a look
at the back of your cards."

11:13.674 --> 11:16.007
-Mine's just a squiggly drawing.
-Mine, too.

11:16.234 --> 11:18.234
And mine just says "map" on it.

11:18.253 --> 11:19.827
It's a map!
We have to put it together!

11:19.921 --> 11:21.921
MOON:
Looks like we go to this "X"

11:22.015 --> 11:23.682
by the river
down past the fallen tree

11:23.909 --> 11:26.759
-that looks like
Sigourney Weaver's elbow.
-HONEYBEE: My God,

11:26.912 --> 11:28.335
this area is full
of celebrities.

11:28.430 --> 11:31.672
Yeah, this is basically
Lone Moose's Walk of Fame.

11:31.692 --> 11:34.267
Look! There's a raft!

11:35.253 --> 11:37.195
"You're family
in foul and fair weather,

11:37.346 --> 11:39.272
and the glue
that keeps this raft together."

11:39.424 --> 11:41.348
And there's another little map
of where we're supposed

11:41.368 --> 11:42.592
-to take the boat to.
-Ugh!

11:42.610 --> 11:44.110
So we're still
all sticking together,

11:44.262 --> 11:46.446
floating on a boat
that was premade?

11:46.598 --> 11:48.097
This isn't like
a Beef Hunt at all.

11:48.116 --> 11:49.874
We should each be alone
in the woods somewhere,

11:50.026 --> 11:51.784
trying to squeeze drinking water
out of a dead frog.

11:51.878 --> 11:53.937
Okay, We need to get
to this spot.

11:54.030 --> 11:55.621
Let me hold the card, Judy.

11:55.774 --> 11:58.032
I can hold a card, Wolf. I'm 16.

11:58.051 --> 11:59.700
Oh, no. I was supposed
to preheat the oven

11:59.794 --> 12:01.160
for my casserole, and I forgot!

12:01.312 --> 12:02.387
Great, more cooking.

12:02.538 --> 12:05.039
-Did you want
to say something, Moon?
-Yes.

12:05.058 --> 12:07.784
You've been acting
like an ass-erole all wee...

12:07.802 --> 12:09.144
(all scream)

12:13.049 --> 12:15.883
We're gonna drown!
Oh, wait, no, we can stand.

12:15.902 --> 12:17.810
-(Judy shivering)
-Dad built a bad boat?

12:17.963 --> 12:20.146
Every belief I have about
the world has been shattered,

12:20.298 --> 12:22.723
but I don't have time
to process it right now.

12:22.743 --> 12:24.576
Hey! A box!

12:24.727 --> 12:28.304
Ooh, good, a change of clothes.
I'm freezing.

12:28.323 --> 12:30.823
I guess I've grown a lot
since Dad bought these.

12:30.917 --> 12:32.658
(laughs)
Why did he buy them?

12:32.753 --> 12:34.085
After Mom left, Dad went through

12:34.237 --> 12:36.312
a pretty serious
Home Shopping Network phase.

12:36.331 --> 12:38.590
He bought the whole family
matching sweat suits

12:38.783 --> 12:40.316
at his absolute lowest moment.

12:40.335 --> 12:42.485
He also bought
something called a Wow-el.

12:42.504 --> 12:44.262
It's a towel
that makes you go, "Wow."

12:44.489 --> 12:45.930
Hey, there's a note in my pocket

12:46.082 --> 12:48.600
that says we should head
for that ridge over there.

12:48.827 --> 12:52.103
(whistles)
Mother maze I.

12:52.255 --> 12:54.847
Relax, Beef, she's dry.
You can do this.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.182
I want you to pet the toilet.

12:56.334 --> 12:59.593
-Mm. Um...
-Just like that. Easy, now.

12:59.687 --> 13:00.779
Give her a little tickle
under her bowl.

13:00.930 --> 13:01.946
-She likes that.
-(groaning)

13:02.098 --> 13:03.948
See? She's real friendly.
And now

13:04.100 --> 13:05.432
you're ready

15:19.753 --> 15:22.086
-It's getting kind of late
in the day.
-But your father said

15:22.238 --> 15:23.496
I could have fun with it.

15:23.648 --> 15:25.590
Fine. In order
to pass over the bridge,

15:25.741 --> 15:26.925
you must recite the poem

15:27.152 --> 15:29.093
"Ye Ballad
of the Sportsman's Horseman."

15:29.245 --> 15:31.821
-Oh, no! I don't know it!
-For every correct line,

15:31.839 --> 15:35.249
you may all take one step
across the bridge.

15:35.268 --> 15:37.677
-All together? Again?
-Why would Dad do this?

15:37.771 --> 15:41.164
-I haven't memorized it yet.
-Judy, you have to try.

15:41.182 --> 15:44.000
Okay, here goes.
"The horseman's corset

15:44.018 --> 15:46.093
forces
the lord's reinforcements."

15:46.187 --> 15:48.613
Correct. You may all take
one step forward.

15:48.840 --> 15:50.114
The next line, please?

15:50.266 --> 15:51.950
"Worried? Flurried?"

15:52.101 --> 15:54.118
No, that's wrong.
See? I don't know it.

15:54.345 --> 15:55.678
"All hurried they run,

15:55.771 --> 15:58.347
scurrying, worrying, furry,
and slurrying."

15:58.366 --> 16:00.774
-Correct.
-Moon! Oh, my God!

16:00.868 --> 16:02.627
I heard you do it
a hundred times.

16:02.854 --> 16:04.353
I guess I memorized part of it.

16:04.372 --> 16:07.448
"The birds' beaks
peak and screech, beseeching..."

16:07.467 --> 16:10.710
"And... bequeathing
a maiden's teat!"

16:10.862 --> 16:12.786
Correct, and correct.

16:12.880 --> 16:14.621
"The sport is upon us
at the court."

16:14.716 --> 16:16.457
JUDY AND HONEYBEE:
"The gentleman pats his seat."

16:16.476 --> 16:18.142
-(cheering, whooping)
-We did it!
-Oh, my God!

16:18.369 --> 16:19.793
We did that stupid poem!

16:19.813 --> 16:20.979
And now a victory song.

16:21.130 --> 16:22.722
(high-pitched):
♪<i> La</i> ♪

16:22.816 --> 16:26.042
♪<i> Welcome, young travelers</i>
<i> who come from afar...</i> ♪

16:26.060 --> 16:28.711
Santiago, this is clearly
just your welcome song.

16:28.730 --> 16:31.063
Just tell us the next challenge,
Santiago.

16:31.157 --> 16:33.157
Fine, but I'm using
my wizard voice.

16:33.309 --> 16:35.326
"You've eaten and run
and managed not to drown.

16:35.478 --> 16:38.645
Now you shall find the last
challenge in old Tobin Town."

16:38.740 --> 16:40.239
(high-pitched):
♪<i> La</i> ♪

16:40.391 --> 16:43.075
♪<i> Farewell, young travelers,</i>

16:43.228 --> 16:44.560
Santiago, no.

16:44.579 --> 16:46.004
<i> KYLE:</i>
<i> All right, before you do this,</i>

16:46.155 --> 16:47.821
I'd like to give you something.

16:47.915 --> 16:49.565
This is my magic wrench.

16:49.584 --> 16:51.901
No poop can touch you
while you're using that wrench.

16:51.919 --> 16:54.086
Is this, like, a Dumbo thing,
where it's not really magic,

16:54.239 --> 16:55.513
but I'm supposed to believe
in it?

16:55.664 --> 16:57.682
You got me, Tobin.
Now fix that toilet.

16:57.833 --> 16:59.242
Also, what's Dumbo?

16:59.260 --> 17:01.352
Tobin Town,
our childhood tree house.

17:01.504 --> 17:03.246
(chuckles): I haven't been
back here in years.

17:03.339 --> 17:06.357
Uh, probably because a series
of storms left it very unsafe.

17:06.584 --> 17:09.027
"To get this hunt in the bag,
Wolf has got to capture a flag.

17:09.136 --> 17:11.087
"But the twist is,
I'm taking his sight,

17:11.105 --> 17:13.031
and it's up to you others
to steer him right."

17:13.224 --> 17:15.182
And then it says you have to put
this blindfold on

17:15.276 --> 17:18.036
-and we guide you to the top.
-This should be no problem.

17:18.263 --> 17:19.871
I have
amazing natural instincts.

17:20.098 --> 17:21.931
-(grunts)
-(grunts) See? That was a tree.

17:22.024 --> 17:24.000
-That was Moon.
-He's gonna die.

17:28.048 --> 17:29.288
Pull yourself up
through the opening above you.

17:29.440 --> 17:30.715
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

17:30.866 --> 17:32.108
You have to trust us.

17:32.201 --> 17:34.201
-(whimpers)
-HAM: Okay, go to your left.

17:34.220 --> 17:36.387
Be careful,
'cause the railings are broken.

17:36.614 --> 17:38.372
JUDY: Stop! Watch out
for the big branch

17:38.466 --> 17:40.116
coming through the floor, okay?

17:40.209 --> 17:42.393
Slide to your left
and step over it.

17:42.545 --> 17:43.302
HAM:
Okay.

17:43.396 --> 17:44.804
Keep going. Now grab the flag.

17:44.898 --> 17:47.456
It's right in front of you.

17:47.550 --> 17:49.025
I did it!

17:49.794 --> 17:50.976
Great job, babe.

17:51.129 --> 17:52.570
We've been going all day,
and we're still tied.

17:52.797 --> 17:54.888
How is anyone supposed
to win this Beef Hunt?

17:54.908 --> 17:57.800
(gasps)
Ooh! I guess by pulling this.

17:57.893 --> 17:59.726
(all scream)

18:00.638 --> 18:03.730
-(bell dings)
-Ah, and now to check on the
other thing I've got cooking.

18:03.750 --> 18:07.067
Guys, I think I'm gonna go ahead
and say my swear now.

18:07.087 --> 18:09.069
-(bleep)
-Oh, my God!
-Yeesh!

-Granthar, please.

18:22.268 --> 18:24.585

for Thanksgiving dinner.

18:25.939 --> 18:27.754
Fine.
Please just put on the costumes

18:27.774 --> 18:29.014
you'll find in the cage,

18:29.167 --> 18:30.441
and I'll read you the card.

18:30.634 --> 18:32.944
And now for the final challenge.
(clears throat)

18:33.095 --> 18:35.113
"Here you are
at the finish line,

18:35.340 --> 18:37.931
"held together
like a raft with twine.

18:38.025 --> 18:39.450
"You were supposed to learn
a lesson,

18:39.677 --> 18:41.844
"but now you're trapped
and you're still guessin'.

18:41.863 --> 18:44.122
"I think that you
would learn a lot-o

18:44.273 --> 18:48.184
if you would recite
the family motto."

18:48.202 --> 18:49.127
Family motto?

18:49.278 --> 18:50.686
I don't know
what he's talking about.

18:50.705 --> 18:52.037
And what lesson
were we supposed to learn?

18:52.132 --> 18:53.947
The Beef Hunt is
about brute competition

18:53.967 --> 18:55.299
and shoving people
into snowbanks.

18:55.451 --> 18:57.135
And shouting, "See you in hell."

18:57.362 --> 19:00.138
And why did he say the raft
was held together with twine?

19:00.365 --> 19:01.881
The raft totally fell apart.

19:01.975 --> 19:04.124
(sighs)
Guys, we've been so stupid.

19:04.144 --> 19:06.202
Dad's been trying
to tell us something all day,

19:06.220 --> 19:07.203
and we weren't listening.

19:07.221 --> 19:08.980
The note said<i> we</i> were the glue.

19:09.207 --> 19:10.982
We're supposed to hold
the raft together.

19:11.209 --> 19:13.709
But we were too busy fighting
to understand.

19:13.728 --> 19:16.045
And all the stops along the way
were to remind us

19:16.063 --> 19:17.229
to be thankful for each other.

19:17.382 --> 19:19.882
The trivia quiz
with all the happy memories.

19:19.975 --> 19:21.975
The mouse maze
from our beautiful youth.

19:21.995 --> 19:24.144
You guys helping me remember
my stupid poem.

19:24.238 --> 19:26.889
Yeah, and I bravely and
majestically climbed this fort

19:26.908 --> 19:28.315
while blindfolded.

19:28.409 --> 19:30.001
Okay, I guess with
a little help from you guys.

19:30.228 --> 19:32.319
Well, I didn't need to learn
any lessons.

19:32.338 --> 19:33.838
I've been an angel all week.

19:33.989 --> 19:35.748
I've just been drinking my wine
and reading my Viking books.

19:35.900 --> 19:38.234
Oh, my God, the motto--
it's from the Viking books!

19:38.327 --> 19:41.495
Oh, right! Duh.
We're all dressed as Vikings.

19:41.514 --> 19:44.240
We're supposed to do the
Hacking Halvorsons family motto.

19:44.242 --> 19:45.999
Everybody remember it?

19:46.019 --> 19:47.426
I will eat the bones and flesh

19:47.520 --> 19:50.095
of anyone who hurts my
Halvorson brothers and sisters.

19:50.248 --> 19:51.914
And I will use their kneecaps
as saucers

19:51.933 --> 19:53.265
and their skulls as bowls

19:53.418 --> 19:55.084
for the stew I make
from their brains.

19:55.177 --> 19:58.237
All hail Ragnar the Unyielding!

19:59.032 --> 20:00.940
-(cheering)
-My Vikings!

20:01.034 --> 20:02.200
I trust you've learned
the lesson

20:02.351 --> 20:03.534
I was trying to impart.

20:03.761 --> 20:05.536
That we should stop acting
like jerky-turkeys

20:05.688 --> 20:07.096
during Thanksgiving week?

20:07.189 --> 20:08.981
Yes. Usually the Beef Hunt
is about learning to survive

20:09.042 --> 20:10.766
in the wilderness,
but this year's Beef Hunt

20:10.785 --> 20:12.859
was about learning
to be grateful for your family.

20:12.879 --> 20:14.437
And I knew you guys would do it.

20:14.455 --> 20:16.196
Well, that's not totally true--
I also fixed the toilet

20:16.290 --> 20:18.774
in the guest cabin
in case you didn't do it.

20:18.867 --> 20:21.034
But wait, there's still
one thing I can't figure out.

20:21.054 --> 20:22.720
How did eating
all that cranberry sauce

20:22.947 --> 20:24.296
make us feel grateful
for each other?

20:24.390 --> 20:26.949
It didn't. I just bought too
much cranberry sauce on sale,

20:26.951 --> 20:28.208
and it was about to expire.

20:28.228 --> 20:30.469
Is there a place
at the Thanksgiving table

20:30.621 --> 20:31.878
for Granthar the wizard?

20:31.898 --> 20:33.731
Of course, Santiago. Come along.

20:33.958 --> 20:35.900
SANTIAGO:
I'll have to keep my robe on
for dinner.

20:36.127 --> 20:37.977
I'm quite nude underneath.

20:38.071 --> 20:39.886
<i> HAM:</i>
<i> Does anybody want</i>

20:39.906 --> 20:41.480
more French-fried
fish stick flan?

20:41.632 --> 20:43.649
(chuckles):
Oh, no, I couldn't possibly.

20:43.743 --> 20:46.393
Honey,
I think it's flan-tastic.

20:47.154 --> 20:49.638
Well, today was a big success:
I finally fixed a toilet,

20:49.732 --> 20:51.974
and you guys learned
how to get along again.

20:51.993 --> 20:53.918
And even though I didn't win
the Beef Hunt,

20:54.028 --> 20:55.402
I finally got to say (bleep).

20:55.421 --> 20:56.829
