Our current theory is that
it's a roving binary black hole.

We believe the two black holes
are merging,

Why was Kwejian destroyed

what we're looking at.

14:39.530 --> 14:41.271
It's... bizarre.

14:41.315 --> 14:44.274
And that is
a scientific observation.

14:45.449 --> 14:46.929
What else are our scans
telling us?

14:46.973 --> 14:48.931
Not much. Scans can't penetrate

14:48.975 --> 14:50.715
the outer edge
of the accretion cloud.

14:50.759 --> 14:52.587
Can we boost power
to the scanners?

14:52.630 --> 14:55.546
Already tried. The scans aren't
viable unless we get closer.

14:55.590 --> 14:57.548
BURNHAM:
How close?

14:57.592 --> 15:00.203
Past the outer edge of dust
and into the accretion cloud?

15:00.247 --> 15:01.509
That's in
the yellow zone, Captain.

15:01.552 --> 15:03.554
Discoverywould be
at serious risk.

15:03.598 --> 15:05.817
We have to know what
we're dealing with.

15:05.861 --> 15:07.297
Mr. Saru?

15:07.341 --> 15:09.865
We could send DOTs
with sensors attached,

15:09.909 --> 15:11.911
but the gravitational
distortions

15:11.954 --> 15:14.174
would make it very difficult
to communicate with them.

15:14.217 --> 15:15.523
They're also way too small.

15:15.566 --> 15:17.438
Not enough mass
to penetrate the dust.

15:17.481 --> 15:18.439
My ship can do it.

15:18.482 --> 15:19.701
Enough mass to get in,

15:19.744 --> 15:21.355
not so much
that I'll be in trouble.

15:21.398 --> 15:23.487
Plus, my ship can change shape

15:23.531 --> 15:24.924
to compensate for the torque.

15:24.967 --> 15:26.490
As long as
I'm not inside too long...

15:27.796 --> 15:29.798
The science holds.

15:31.234 --> 15:33.802
Commander Detmer, get ready.
Commander Stamets,

15:33.845 --> 15:35.499
I want you with her
to conduct the scans.

15:35.543 --> 15:36.848
BOOK:
Captain.

15:39.286 --> 15:41.070
Can we talk?

15:41.114 --> 15:42.506
Detmer doesn't know
the first thing

15:42.550 --> 15:43.768
-about how to morph my ship.
-Whoever goes in there

15:43.812 --> 15:45.205
-has to be clear-headed.
-And I'm not?

15:45.248 --> 15:47.250
How could you be, after
everything that's happened?

15:47.294 --> 15:49.209
-That's for me to judge.
-And me.

15:49.252 --> 15:51.254
-As captain of this ship.
-Pretend for one second

15:51.298 --> 15:52.952
you're in my place.

15:52.995 --> 15:54.605
Come on, Michael,
you'd fight like hell

15:54.649 --> 15:55.780
to go on this mission.

15:55.824 --> 15:57.130
And Hugh would say no.

15:57.173 --> 15:58.740
-Michael...
-And he would be right.

15:58.783 --> 16:00.307
-That thing destroyed my home.
-I know. And I know you want

16:00.350 --> 16:01.656
-to do something.
-I'm the best pilot
for this mission

16:01.699 --> 16:03.049
-and you know it.
-Listen, I know you want

16:03.092 --> 16:04.093
to do something,
but it's not as simple as that.

16:04.137 --> 16:05.747
I don't need your permission.

16:05.790 --> 16:07.009
I'm not Starfleet.

16:07.053 --> 16:08.315
Technically,
I'm not even under your command.

16:08.358 --> 16:10.273
If you go out there
and you're not ready...

16:11.883 --> 16:15.061
...you endanger everyone
on this ship.

16:15.104 --> 16:17.324
Come on. Look, I know you don't
want to put more lives at risk.

16:17.367 --> 16:19.500
Getting this data, and doing
it right the first time,

16:19.543 --> 16:20.980
is our best chance
to save lives.

16:22.155 --> 16:24.331
We can warn other worlds,
give them time to evacuate.

16:26.637 --> 16:29.771
I'm going, Michael.

16:29.814 --> 16:32.078
I'm flying straight at
that thing.

16:32.121 --> 16:34.341
If you want to stop me,
you can throw me in the brig

16:34.384 --> 16:35.995
or you can shoot me
out of the sky.

16:38.040 --> 16:39.476
But I'm going.

16:43.350 --> 16:46.309
It's everything I'd imagined.
[soft chuckle]

16:46.353 --> 16:49.008
I can't believe
I get to start my life again.

16:49.051 --> 16:51.793
I could become a host again.

16:51.836 --> 16:54.578
Finish my training
to be a Guardian.

16:54.622 --> 16:56.145
-I-I could...
-ADIRA: Anything.

16:56.189 --> 16:59.844
I mean, you can do anything.

16:59.888 --> 17:01.107
Yeah.

17:01.150 --> 17:02.934
But...

17:02.978 --> 17:04.849
with everything
that's happened...

17:06.721 --> 17:08.201
Is there something
not right with the body?

17:09.680 --> 17:11.204
He's feeling guilty

17:11.247 --> 17:13.510
about being happy right now.

17:13.554 --> 17:14.729
You know?

17:18.167 --> 17:21.214
Life goes on, Gray. It has to.

17:21.257 --> 17:22.650
For all of us.

17:22.693 --> 17:24.652
But the artisan did
a beautiful job with the body.

17:24.695 --> 17:26.697
She used the Soong Method,

17:26.741 --> 17:29.439
named after the 24th century
cyberneticist who developed it.

17:29.483 --> 17:32.225
This is 800-year-old technology?

17:32.268 --> 17:35.619
Maybe I should get
a synth body when I die, too.

17:35.663 --> 17:37.969
We could live forever.

17:38.013 --> 17:40.233
Well, not likely.

17:40.276 --> 17:42.365
But the process was attempted
a number of times

17:42.409 --> 17:45.934
after Dr. Soong first used it
on a... a Starfleet admiral--

17:45.977 --> 17:47.414
Picard was his name--

17:47.457 --> 17:49.155
but the success rate was so low

17:49.198 --> 17:51.418
that eventually people
just stopped trying.

17:51.461 --> 17:53.942
What...
Should we be worried?

17:53.985 --> 17:55.857
Well, the fact that
Gray's consciousness

17:55.900 --> 17:58.120
has already survived transfer
to a new host once

17:58.164 --> 17:59.817
seems to be a good sign.

17:59.861 --> 18:01.167
But we should ask Guardian Xi

18:01.210 --> 18:02.559
once the synthetic body's ready.

18:03.821 --> 18:06.041
When I incorporate,

18:06.085 --> 18:09.044
will the body age and die?

18:09.088 --> 18:10.437
Like I would have before?

18:10.480 --> 18:14.136
Uh, he's asking if
this body will get old.

18:14.180 --> 18:16.965
You know, like, gray hair,

18:17.008 --> 18:19.141
the long, scraggly nose hairs,

18:19.185 --> 18:20.273
the pot belly and all.

18:20.316 --> 18:21.578
So not what I said.

18:21.622 --> 18:23.406
It will age in the same way.

18:23.450 --> 18:24.973
For better or for worse.

18:27.932 --> 18:29.847
GRAY:
Can we get rid of the mole?

18:29.891 --> 18:31.719
I thought
you stopped hating that.

18:31.762 --> 18:34.635
I just asked, because...

18:34.678 --> 18:37.551
transitioning, it's like I had
bigger things to think about,

18:37.594 --> 18:40.858
but if I get another chance

18:40.902 --> 18:43.426
to remake my body, then...

18:43.470 --> 18:45.385
why not get rid of
all the things

18:45.428 --> 18:48.039
that aren't totally "me,"
you know?

18:51.130 --> 18:52.609
He wants to lose the mole.

18:52.653 --> 18:54.655
Oh. Well, that's why we're here,

18:54.698 --> 18:56.004
to make
last-minute adjustments.

18:56.047 --> 18:57.136
[Adira chuckles]

18:59.050 --> 19:01.444
[trilling]

19:22.248 --> 19:24.467
[door chimes]

19:24.511 --> 19:25.773
Come.

19:28.950 --> 19:31.213
Oh. You added a holo.

19:31.257 --> 19:32.867
[bird squawks]

19:32.910 --> 19:34.651
Helps to get away sometimes.

19:36.044 --> 19:37.959
Is this Ni'Var?

19:38.002 --> 19:39.787
Cliffs of Surak.

19:41.702 --> 19:43.530
That's Lake Yuron.

19:45.096 --> 19:49.100
It looks the same
as it did when I was a child,

19:49.144 --> 19:51.059
when this was Vulcan.

19:51.102 --> 19:53.322
I used to run away...

19:53.366 --> 19:55.150
I used to run away here.

19:55.194 --> 19:58.153
When I was getting used
to my parents being gone.

20:02.505 --> 20:05.465
Uh, you wished to speak
with me about Mr. Booker?

20:06.901 --> 20:08.294
Take me home, Zora.

20:08.337 --> 20:09.860
ZORA:
Yes, Captain.

20:13.212 --> 20:15.562
The computer's now Zora?

20:15.605 --> 20:17.390
Picked the name herself.

20:17.433 --> 20:19.653
-Oh.
-[Burnham chuckles]

20:19.696 --> 20:21.611
Please.

20:28.357 --> 20:31.099
Book plans to fly to the anomaly

20:31.142 --> 20:33.406
with or without my permission.

20:33.449 --> 20:35.582
Well, that would
certainly be deleterious

20:35.625 --> 20:37.236
to your relationship.

20:38.889 --> 20:40.456
The captain in me knows

20:40.500 --> 20:43.024
that he's the right choice
for the mission.

20:43.067 --> 20:45.418
He knows it, too.

20:45.461 --> 20:47.246
But...

20:48.464 --> 20:50.727
I've seen him...

20:50.771 --> 20:53.991
not sleeping, not eating...

20:54.035 --> 20:58.126
Mr. Booker's expertise
with his ship

20:58.169 --> 21:01.129
does make him supremely well
suited for this particular task.

21:01.172 --> 21:03.131
More so than Commander Detmer,

21:03.174 --> 21:05.394
despite her considerable skills.

21:05.438 --> 21:07.962
His planet was destroyed.

21:08.005 --> 21:11.357
Well, billions more lives
will be at risk

21:11.400 --> 21:13.054
until we understand
the anomaly

21:13.097 --> 21:14.577
well enough
to predict its path.

21:14.621 --> 21:16.536
So you think
I should let him go.

21:16.579 --> 21:19.756
As do you, I believe.

21:19.800 --> 21:24.326
Yeah, but your personal feelings
complicate your decision.

21:24.370 --> 21:27.329
What if he takes
unnecessary risks?

21:27.373 --> 21:30.332
I wonder, then,
if added safety measures

21:30.376 --> 21:32.900
would be helpful
to all involved.

21:32.943 --> 21:36.512
I have some ideas,
if that would be helpful.

21:38.906 --> 21:42.518
Have I mentioned
I am glad you're back?

21:43.563 --> 21:45.304
I believe you have.

21:46.827 --> 21:49.133
You want to send
the only two people

21:49.177 --> 21:51.397
who can operate
the spore drive, together,

21:51.440 --> 21:53.137
into the accretion cloud

21:53.181 --> 21:55.270
of an unknown
astrophysical entity?

21:55.314 --> 21:57.751
You might as well
blow me out an airlock.

21:57.794 --> 21:59.274
Oh.

22:00.623 --> 22:02.625
Too soon?
Probably too soon.

22:02.669 --> 22:05.454
But still, it's madness.

22:05.498 --> 22:08.152
Yes, which is why
you'll be going as a holo.

22:08.196 --> 22:11.242
Oh. Well, in that case...

22:11.286 --> 22:13.941
Your body will be right here
on Discoverythe entire time.

22:13.984 --> 22:16.509
The anomaly creates
enormous distortions.

22:16.552 --> 22:18.424
We might not be able
to maintain a holo signal.

22:18.467 --> 22:21.340
Right, which is why
we'll be using a tether

22:21.383 --> 22:23.820
to help Book's ship maintain
proximity to Discovery.

22:23.864 --> 22:26.780
And, if we have to,
we will use it to pull him out.

22:29.957 --> 22:32.742
And I want you on the bridge,
listening in on comms.

22:32.786 --> 22:34.875
Let me know if you have
any reason for concern.

22:34.918 --> 22:36.093
Yes, Captain.

22:41.142 --> 22:42.752
"Blow me out an airlock"?

22:42.796 --> 22:44.406
It was humor.

22:44.450 --> 22:46.147
Neural link.

22:46.190 --> 22:47.409
You'll feel everything
on Book's ship

22:47.453 --> 22:48.889
as if you were really there.

22:48.932 --> 22:50.760
If, for whatever reason,
you remove this transmitter,

22:50.804 --> 22:53.197
you'll be right back here...
What's wrong?

22:54.677 --> 22:58.202
I wouldn't know what to say
to Book on a good day.

22:59.682 --> 23:02.119
Well, when you lost me, what did
you want people to say to you?

23:02.163 --> 23:05.427
It's not nearly the same thing.

23:05.471 --> 23:07.560
Grief is grief.

23:07.603 --> 23:09.692
And everyone moves
through it differently.

23:09.736 --> 23:11.564
Let Book guide you.

23:11.607 --> 23:13.740
Are you sure?

23:13.783 --> 23:16.917
Things have been
seriously awkward with him

23:16.960 --> 23:19.572
since he jumped Discovery
to the dilithium planet.

23:20.747 --> 23:22.618
Just trust your instincts.

23:22.662 --> 23:24.446
You should know better
than to say that to me.

23:24.490 --> 23:26.361
You're better
than you think you are.

23:29.451 --> 23:31.584
STAMETS:
Book. Hi.

23:31.627 --> 23:34.369
Uh, sorry, I'm...

23:34.413 --> 23:37.154
-still getting used to this,
uh, new tech.
-[Grudge growls]

23:37.198 --> 23:39.287
We're leaving soon. Get ready.

23:39.330 --> 23:40.810
It's so smooth.

23:40.854 --> 23:43.639
I-I thought I'd be able
to tell the difference, but...

23:43.683 --> 23:45.685
Wait for us to crash,
then we'll see.

23:45.728 --> 23:47.991
Right.

23:50.211 --> 23:53.997
So, um,
I've been meaning to ask you.

23:54.041 --> 23:57.653
When-when you're using
the spore drive interface,

23:57.697 --> 24:01.309
do you ever feel...
cramps in your hands?

24:01.352 --> 24:04.573
Or, uh, tingles in your arms?

24:05.748 --> 24:07.358
No?

24:09.056 --> 24:10.274
Okay...

24:10.318 --> 24:11.319
Hey, girl.

24:11.362 --> 24:12.538
-[growls]
-I wouldn't do that.

24:12.581 --> 24:14.670
Holos freak her out.
She can't smell you.

24:16.716 --> 24:18.326
Come on, darling.

24:18.369 --> 24:20.589
-Let's get you secured.
-[meows]

24:24.201 --> 24:27.204
Look, uh, I get it.

24:27.248 --> 24:30.381
We're not friends. [chuckles]

24:30.425 --> 24:33.515
But... I know
you've been through a lot.

24:33.559 --> 24:36.126
So, uh...

24:36.170 --> 24:38.651
if there's anything
I can do to help out or...

24:38.694 --> 24:40.391
Maybe stop talking.

24:40.435 --> 24:41.610
That'd be a good start.

24:41.654 --> 24:42.916
Excuse me?

24:42.959 --> 24:44.352
I don't need a tether

24:44.395 --> 24:45.614
and I sure as hell
don't need a minder.

24:45.658 --> 24:46.963
I'm here for the data.

24:47.007 --> 24:48.487
You wouldn't know
what to look for.

24:48.530 --> 24:49.923
Fine.

24:52.316 --> 24:54.493
I fly. You scan.

24:59.019 --> 25:01.151
BURNHAM:
Owosekun, how's it looking
out there?

25:01.195 --> 25:04.372
Gravitational fluctuations
remain within safe parameters.

25:04.415 --> 25:06.200
All right, Book,
we're good to go.

25:06.243 --> 25:08.724

-Go!

34:55.441 --> 34:57.399
What happened? Book?

34:57.443 --> 34:58.400
BOOK:
I missed it.

34:58.444 --> 34:59.401
Damn.

34:59.445 --> 35:00.446
Listen.

35:00.489 --> 35:01.882
Another will come.

35:01.925 --> 35:03.057
It'll be tight, but--

35:03.101 --> 35:04.667
but there is enough power
to the engine

35:04.711 --> 35:06.104
to give it one more shot.

35:09.150 --> 35:10.804
You get to try again.

35:10.847 --> 35:11.805
That's something.

35:11.848 --> 35:13.023
We'll-we'll try this again.

35:13.067 --> 35:14.895
It's over.

35:14.938 --> 35:16.375
It's not.

35:18.986 --> 35:20.422
Pull off the transmitter.

35:20.466 --> 35:21.902
No.

No one's here.

Book.

Book, we don't have
a lot of time.

36:03.813 --> 36:05.075
Captain...

36:05.119 --> 36:06.468
I think he may need

36:06.512 --> 36:08.644
a little more help
with this one.

36:11.081 --> 36:13.432
Perhaps now is
an appropriate time

36:13.475 --> 36:15.129
for you to set aside
the captain

36:15.173 --> 36:16.826
in favor of the partner?

36:23.224 --> 36:25.183
Bryce, open a private channel,
please.

Hey, Book.

to listen to me:

36:39.762 --> 36:41.764
You couldn't have saved them.

36:42.896 --> 36:44.637
There is nothing
you could've done.

I should have sensed it.

37:02.263 --> 37:04.178
No.

37:05.310 --> 37:07.529
This isn't your fault.

37:16.973 --> 37:19.237
I failed, Michael.

37:20.673 --> 37:23.066
I failed them.

37:23.110 --> 37:25.417
I know it feels that way.

37:26.983 --> 37:29.159
But you didn't.

37:29.203 --> 37:33.033
You didn't fail them.

37:33.076 --> 37:36.036
And I won't fail you,

37:36.079 --> 37:37.429

uh, for your advice,
um, with Adira.

uh, light touch with people.

No.

You can tell me.

I don't know if he knew...

45:34.644 --> 45:38.126
if I ever let him know
how much I loved him.

45:40.563 --> 45:43.828
You know, for so many years,

45:43.871 --> 45:46.482
I told myself
I didn't need family.

45:46.526 --> 45:48.310
Didn't need Kwejian.

45:49.311 --> 45:52.793

my brother again...

45:52.837 --> 45:55.143
the nephew
I didn't even know I had...

45:57.015 --> 45:59.452
And when I looked at Leto...

46:01.584 --> 46:03.456
I saw a new beginning.

46:03.499 --> 46:05.545
For all of us.

46:06.894 --> 46:10.202
We could give him a future

46:10.245 --> 46:12.204
where there was a home...

46:12.247 --> 46:15.250
and family...

46:15.294 --> 46:17.296
and love.

46:18.558 --> 46:20.908
And nothing he couldn't do.

46:25.957 --> 46:27.915
I'm sorry.

47:01.819 --> 47:03.690
Has the data
from Mr. Booker's ship

47:03.733 --> 47:05.300
shed new light on
the nature of this threat?

47:05.344 --> 47:08.390
Not yet. We still have an
Everest-sized mountain of data

47:08.434 --> 47:10.131

Oh, uh...

47:11.829 --> 47:14.701
Earth mountain. It's very big.

47:14.744 --> 47:18.400
Doesn't matter. Point being,
I did find something.

47:18.444 --> 47:20.576
The reason
the distortions got worse,

47:20.620 --> 47:22.578
even though Discovery
held its position?

47:22.622 --> 47:25.712
So this is the anomaly
when we arrived.

47:25.755 --> 47:29.411
And this is it after we left.

47:29.455 --> 47:32.066
It changed direction?

47:32.110 --> 47:34.373
What could have caused that?

47:34.416 --> 47:36.070
That's the thing:

47:36.114 --> 47:38.420
there is nothing in
my understanding of astrophysics

47:38.464 --> 47:40.292
that can explain it.

47:40.335 --> 47:43.251
But... we gathered this data

47:43.295 --> 47:45.775
in order to predict its path.

47:45.819 --> 47:47.777
Are you saying
we cannot do that?

47:48.822 --> 47:50.998
No, sir, we can't.

47:51.042 --> 47:55.046
It could go anywhere,
at any time, and...

47:55.089 --> 47:58.310
we may not have
any kind of warning at all.
