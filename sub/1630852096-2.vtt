Previously on
Star Trek: Discovery...

00:09.096 --> 00:13.361
The new president of
the Federation, Laira Rillak.

00:13.404 --> 00:17.060
I am T'Rina,
President of Ni'Var.

00:17.104 --> 00:18.496
CULBER:
Gray?

00:18.540 --> 00:20.803
We'll find a way to help you
be seen, truly seen.

00:20.846 --> 00:22.152
By everyone.

00:22.196 --> 00:24.633
You're thinking
of Discoveryagain.

00:24.676 --> 00:26.548
I am.

00:26.591 --> 00:30.247
My heart is here, but yours
can be here and out there.

00:31.292 --> 00:33.990
Nanosecond this is over,
I'm on the first ship home.

00:34.034 --> 00:36.471
Captain Nalas, when's
the last time you went back?

00:36.514 --> 00:37.515
Too long.

00:42.607 --> 00:44.740
-Pull up Kwejian on
the deep-space array.
-BURNHAM: What happened?

00:44.783 --> 00:46.611
BOOK:
My ship was hit by something.

00:46.655 --> 00:48.004
The gravitational distortion.

00:48.048 --> 00:49.919
BOOK:
They're gone.

00:49.962 --> 00:52.139
They're all gone.

01:37.880 --> 01:40.056
Book...

01:40.100 --> 01:41.492
[child laughs]

01:43.015 --> 01:44.408
Book.

01:46.062 --> 01:47.542
Book.

02:01.469 --> 02:03.253
I'm here.

02:04.689 --> 02:06.126
Whatever you need.

02:09.390 --> 02:12.219
BRYCE [over comm]:
Captain, your guest is waiting
for you in the ready room.

02:12.262 --> 02:14.525
I need some time, Bryce.

02:14.569 --> 02:16.788
You should go.

02:16.832 --> 02:18.181
No, I...

02:18.225 --> 02:19.835
I need you to go.

02:29.627 --> 02:31.281
Okay.

02:35.067 --> 02:37.113
I'll check on you later.

BURNHAM:
Saru.

02:54.565 --> 02:56.524
You're here.

02:56.567 --> 02:58.003
Captain.

02:58.047 --> 02:59.918
Oh...

03:01.746 --> 03:03.226
Thank you for coming so quickly.

03:03.270 --> 03:06.316
It is an unspeakable tragedy.

03:06.360 --> 03:08.362
Are there any survivors at all?

03:08.405 --> 03:11.060
Right now,
we only know of Book.

03:11.103 --> 03:12.757
But the Federation's trying
to locate

03:12.801 --> 03:14.455
any Kwejian
that may have been off-world.

03:14.498 --> 03:16.021
How is he?

03:16.065 --> 03:18.546
He hasn't left his ship
in two days.

03:18.589 --> 03:21.679
Keeps obsessing
over every detail.

03:21.723 --> 03:23.551
Trying to find-- I don't know--

03:23.594 --> 03:26.815
evidence as to
what may have caused it.

03:26.858 --> 03:31.254
And I've been trying
to get him to talk...

03:31.298 --> 03:35.127
or cry... anything.

03:35.171 --> 03:38.305
He is in so much pain.

03:41.960 --> 03:43.919
I don't know how to reach him.

03:45.007 --> 03:49.054
Well, if loss has
taught us anything,

03:49.098 --> 03:52.797
it is that each of us
must sit with pain

03:52.841 --> 03:54.973
in our own way.

03:56.279 --> 03:57.628
And you?

03:57.672 --> 03:59.587
How are you doing?

04:00.588 --> 04:03.243
I've been conducting
post-mission analyses

04:03.286 --> 04:05.288
to figure out what I could have
done differently.

04:10.032 --> 04:13.514
Lieutenant Aloka,
Ensign Neville, Commander Nalas.

04:14.950 --> 04:16.473
Those losses are on me.

04:16.517 --> 04:21.043
It sounds like you may
also be... obsessing.

04:23.654 --> 04:25.526
Yeah. Maybe so.

04:25.569 --> 04:27.092
That's beautiful.

04:27.136 --> 04:29.312
It's the Kelpien symbol
for community, isn't it?

04:29.356 --> 04:32.184
Ah. Community and service.

04:32.228 --> 04:36.537
It signifies my status as
a council member in my village.

04:36.580 --> 04:39.191
Must have been hard
for you to leave.

04:39.235 --> 04:41.803
Uh, I have made arrangements

04:41.846 --> 04:43.674
to stay in touch with Su'Kal

04:43.718 --> 04:47.330
and continue serving as
a council member in absentia.

04:47.374 --> 04:50.246
Starfleet is where
I am needed now.

04:50.290 --> 04:52.422
Yes, I heard word
that you were offered

04:52.466 --> 04:54.598
the command
of the USS Sojourner.

04:54.642 --> 04:56.687
Congratulations.

04:58.515 --> 05:01.301
I told Admiral Vance

05:01.344 --> 05:04.956
I would gladly return
to the chair one day.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.611
This is not that time.

05:11.180 --> 05:14.662
Our mentor Philippa Georgiou

05:14.705 --> 05:18.492
knew the value of
another set of trusted eyes,

05:18.535 --> 05:20.929
especially in times of crisis.

05:21.973 --> 05:25.194
I asked you to be those eyes
for me when I became captain.

05:27.370 --> 05:30.765
Now it would be my honor--

05:30.808 --> 05:33.071
and indeed my privilege--

05:33.115 --> 05:35.900
to do the same for you,
as your Number One.

05:35.944 --> 05:37.989
If you will have me.

05:42.472 --> 05:46.737
I will take that, old friend.

05:54.789 --> 05:57.313
Five light-years across.

05:57.357 --> 06:00.664
That's the size
of the gravitational anomaly

06:00.708 --> 06:03.058
that hit Kwejian
and the space station.

06:03.101 --> 06:05.887
Five light-years?
That's massive.

06:05.930 --> 06:08.106
We couldn't believe it
at first either, ma'am.

06:08.150 --> 06:10.761
But we've been analyzing
this data for the past 48 hours

06:10.805 --> 06:11.980
and the math doesn't lie.

06:12.023 --> 06:14.199
What exactly is this "anomaly"?

06:14.243 --> 06:15.679
We're not certain.

06:15.723 --> 06:18.987
We know it's there,
we know it's moving,

06:19.030 --> 06:21.990
but we can't quite get
a handle on what it is.

06:22.033 --> 06:26.473
Our current theory is that
it's a roving binary black hole.

06:26.516 --> 06:30.215
We believe the two black holes
are merging,

06:30.259 --> 06:33.871
creating gravitational waves
in the process.

06:33.915 --> 06:35.307
Huge ones.

06:35.351 --> 06:37.701
Why was Kwejian destroyed
and the station wasn't?

06:37.745 --> 06:40.704
Gravitational wave's impact
depends on where the object is

06:40.748 --> 06:42.576
relative to the source.

06:42.619 --> 06:45.622
The closer the object,
the greater the damage.

06:45.666 --> 06:47.624
How did no one see it coming?

06:47.668 --> 06:49.757
TILLY:
Unless matter is actively
falling into a black hole,

06:49.800 --> 06:51.933
they're largely undetectable.

06:51.976 --> 06:53.413
STAMETS:
We've been running simulations

06:53.456 --> 06:55.371
to test our theory.
They seem to mirror,

06:55.415 --> 06:56.633
fairly accurately,

06:56.677 --> 06:58.461
what happened to Kwejian.

07:02.639 --> 07:04.815
[indistinct whispering]

07:06.730 --> 07:08.993
Go on.

07:09.037 --> 07:11.300
[sighs] Continue.

07:22.746 --> 07:26.533
STAMETS:
A planet couldn't possibly
withstand that kind of impact.

07:33.888 --> 07:36.412
Are there records of anything
like this happening before?

07:36.456 --> 07:37.500
We haven't found anything close

07:37.544 --> 07:39.023
in any
of the available databases.

07:39.067 --> 07:40.111
Where's it headed next?

07:40.155 --> 07:41.504
Current data is limited,

07:41.548 --> 07:43.245
but our mathematical models
have it

07:43.288 --> 07:45.421
entering the Riscot system soon.

07:45.465 --> 07:47.554
Let's begin evacuations
right away.

07:47.597 --> 07:50.382
And we should warn the areas
immediately surrounding it.

07:50.426 --> 07:52.036
An anomaly this size
could fling debris

07:52.080 --> 07:53.516
far beyond five light-years.

07:53.560 --> 07:56.171
Where's it going after that?
Where'd it even come from?

07:56.214 --> 07:58.086
Do you have any indication
that it will stop?

07:58.129 --> 07:59.914
To get answers,
we need more data.

07:59.957 --> 08:00.915
We have to get out there.

08:00.958 --> 08:03.047
Scan this thing up close.

08:03.091 --> 08:05.223
Once you have the data,

08:05.267 --> 08:08.966
I offer the services of
the Ni'Var Science Institute.

08:09.010 --> 08:11.099
We may not be
Federation members,

08:11.142 --> 08:14.058
but a crisis such as this
requires all to contribute.

08:14.102 --> 08:16.452
Thank you, President T'Rina.

08:16.496 --> 08:18.019
It would also be prudent

08:18.062 --> 08:21.022
to prepare ourselves
for civil unrest.

08:21.065 --> 08:24.025
This news may reawaken
post-Burn fears.

08:24.068 --> 08:26.549
We are at a fragile time.

08:26.593 --> 08:30.858
Openness and a unified strategy
will be critical.

08:32.207 --> 08:34.862
RILLAK:
Which is precisely why
you're all here.

08:34.905 --> 08:37.125
Federation, non-Federation--

08:37.168 --> 08:39.910
this anomaly
threatens us all equally.

08:39.954 --> 08:42.565
We must all work together.

08:42.609 --> 08:45.612
Discoverywill leave for
the anomaly immediately.

08:51.356 --> 08:54.316
FEMALE [over comm]: All crew,
report to stations, please.

08:54.359 --> 08:56.927
All crew, report to stations.

-Yes, Lieutenant?
-Sorry.

08:58.668 --> 09:00.583
Sorry, just, um... I was...

09:00.627 --> 09:03.630
Ugh, sorry. I'm just-- keep
making it more and more weird.

09:03.673 --> 09:06.676
I'm just gonna say it.
You...

09:06.720 --> 09:08.112
Did you get taller?

09:08.156 --> 09:10.419
Not that I'm aware of.

09:10.462 --> 09:11.812
Oh. Oh, okay.

09:11.855 --> 09:13.944
I d-- I don't know if
Kelpiens grow later in life,

09:13.988 --> 09:15.729
or-- but...

09:15.772 --> 09:18.035
You just-- you do,
you seem taller.

09:18.079 --> 09:19.428
Do I?

09:19.471 --> 09:20.603
Yeah.

09:20.647 --> 09:21.952
I don't know,
maybe you just, like,

09:21.996 --> 09:24.607
have a little more
swagger going on or something.

09:24.651 --> 09:25.608
That's a compliment.

09:25.652 --> 09:28.002
Then I thank you.

09:28.045 --> 09:30.744
I'm really glad you're back.

09:32.876 --> 09:35.096
SARU:
I missed you, too.

09:35.139 --> 09:38.360
And I am very sorry

09:38.403 --> 09:40.754
for what you went through
on the space station.

09:40.797 --> 09:42.364
Thank you.

to spend our moments

Welcome back, Captain.

10:33.850 --> 10:34.938
Thank you.

10:34.982 --> 10:38.855
But please call me Saru.

10:38.899 --> 10:40.901
How about Mr. Saru?

10:40.944 --> 10:43.468
Well, that would be...

10:43.512 --> 10:45.035
acceptable.

10:45.079 --> 10:48.691
Commander Bryce,
open a ship-wide channel.

10:48.735 --> 10:51.389
Aye, Captain.

Ready.

10:57.308 --> 10:59.397
Today we seek
to understand a threat

10:59.441 --> 11:02.400
like none our galaxy
has faced before.

11:02.444 --> 11:06.100
We know the cost of its
destructive power all too well.

11:06.143 --> 11:10.539
We lost colleagues, friends...

11:10.582 --> 11:12.889
and Kwejian.

Countless lives...

11:16.110 --> 11:18.547

11:18.590 --> 11:21.593
We won't let
their deaths be in vain.

11:23.465 --> 11:25.119
And we are going
to make damn sure

11:25.162 --> 11:26.773
nothing like this happens again.

11:26.816 --> 11:29.384

up here.

13:58.359 --> 13:59.447
Detmer, how are we doing?

13:59.490 --> 14:01.188
Safely in
the green zone, Captain.

14:01.231 --> 14:04.104
Matching the anomaly's speed
to maintain relative distance.

14:04.147 --> 14:05.322
Any strain on the ship?

14:05.366 --> 14:07.411
Subspace gravitational waves
are present,

14:07.455 --> 14:08.804
but not the patterns
we expected.

14:08.848 --> 14:09.979
It's very odd.

14:10.023 --> 14:11.198

That's not the only thing.

14:11.241 --> 14:12.590
"Binary black hole" means

14:12.634 --> 14:13.896
we should be seeing

Curiouser and curiouser.

14:16.725 --> 14:18.335
Scientific observation, please?

14:18.379 --> 14:20.076
Apologies, Captain.

14:20.120 --> 14:23.253
It's just not what I was
expecting to see, either.

14:23.297 --> 14:25.865
There's an accretion cloud
made of both gas and dust,

14:25.908 --> 14:28.693
and large amounts of dark matter
surrounding a gravity well,

14:28.737 --> 14:29.999
so a black hole makes sense,
but...

14:30.043 --> 14:32.915
But the gravitational
Doppler shift

14:32.959 --> 14:34.874
from our scans is way off.

I have no idea
what we're looking at.

14:39.530 --> 14:41.271
It's... bizarre.

14:41.315 --> 14:44.274
And that is
a scientific observation.

14:45.449 --> 14:46.929
What else are our scans
telling us?

14:46.973 --> 14:48.931
Not much. Scans can't penetrate

14:48.975 --> 14:50.715
the outer edge
of the accretion cloud.

14:50.759 --> 14:52.587
Can we boost power
to the scanners?

14:52.630 --> 14:55.546
Already tried. The scans aren't
viable unless we get closer.

14:55.590 --> 14:57.548
BURNHAM:
How close?

14:57.592 --> 15:00.203
Past the outer edge of dust
and into the accretion cloud?

15:00.247 --> 15:01.509
That's in
the yellow zone, Captain.

15:01.552 --> 15:03.554
Discoverywould be
at serious risk.

15:03.598 --> 15:05.817
We have to know what
we're dealing with.

15:05.861 --> 15:07.297
Mr. Saru?

15:07.341 --> 15:09.865
We could send DOTs
with sensors attached,

15:09.909 --> 15:11.911
but the gravitational
distortions

15:11.954 --> 15:14.174
would make it very difficult
to communicate with them.

15:14.217 --> 15:15.523
They're also way too small.

15:15.566 --> 15:17.438
Not enough mass
to penetrate the dust.

15:17.481 --> 15:18.439
My ship can do it.

15:18.482 --> 15:19.701
Enough mass to get in,

15:19.744 --> 15:21.355
not so much
that I'll be in trouble.

15:21.398 --> 15:23.487
Plus, my ship can change shape

15:23.531 --> 15:24.924
to compensate for the torque.

15:24.967 --> 15:26.490
As long as
I'm not inside too long...

15:27.796 --> 15:29.798
The science holds.

15:31.234 --> 15:33.802
Commander Detmer, get ready.
Commander Stamets,

15:33.845 --> 15:35.499
I want you with her
to conduct the scans.

15:35.543 --> 15:36.848
BOOK:
Captain.

15:39.286 --> 15:41.070
Can we talk?

15:41.114 --> 15:42.506
Detmer doesn't know
the first thing

15:42.550 --> 15:43.768
-about how to morph my ship.
-Whoever goes in there

15:43.812 --> 15:45.205
-has to be clear-headed.
-And I'm not?

15:45.248 --> 15:47.250
How could you be, after
everything that's happened?

15:47.294 --> 15:49.209
-That's for me to judge.
-And me.

15:49.252 --> 15:51.254
-As captain of this ship.
-Pretend for one second

15:51.298 --> 15:52.952
you're in my place.

15:52.995 --> 15:54.605
Come on, Michael,
you'd fight like hell

15:54.649 --> 15:55.780
to go on this mission.

15:55.824 --> 15:57.130
And Hugh would say no.

15:57.173 --> 15:58.740
-Michael...
-And he would be right.

15:58.783 --> 16:00.307
-That thing destroyed my home.
-I know. And I know you want

16:00.350 --> 16:01.656
-to do something.
-I'm the best pilot
for this mission

16:01.699 --> 16:03.049
-and you know it.
-Listen, I know you want

16:03.092 --> 16:04.093
to do something,
but it's not as simple as that.

16:04.137 --> 16:05.747
I don't need your permission.

16:05.790 --> 16:07.009
I'm not Starfleet.

16:07.053 --> 16:08.315
Technically,
I'm not even under your command.

16:08.358 --> 16:10.273
If you go out there
and you're not ready...

16:11.883 --> 16:15.061
...you endanger everyone
on this ship.

16:15.104 --> 16:17.324
Come on. Look, I know you don't
want to put more lives at risk.

16:17.367 --> 16:19.500
Getting this data, and doing
it right the first time,

16:19.543 --> 16:20.980
is our best chance
to save lives.

16:22.155 --> 16:24.331
We can warn other worlds,
give them time to evacuate.

16:26.637 --> 16:29.771
I'm going, Michael.

16:29.814 --> 16:32.078
I'm flying straight at
that thing.

16:32.121 --> 16:34.341
If you want to stop me,
you can throw me in the brig

16:34.384 --> 16:35.995
or you can shoot me
out of the sky.

16:38.040 --> 16:39.476
But I'm going.

16:43.350 --> 16:46.309
It's everything I'd imagined.
[soft chuckle]

16:46.353 --> 16:49.008
I can't believe
I get to start my life again.

16:49.051 --> 16:51.793
I could become a host again.

16:51.836 --> 16:54.578
Finish my training
to be a Guardian.

16:54.622 --> 16:56.145
-I-I could...
-ADIRA: Anything.

16:56.189 --> 16:59.844
I mean, you can do anything.

16:59.888 --> 17:01.107
Yeah.

17:01.150 --> 17:02.934
But...

17:02.978 --> 17:04.849
with everything
that's happened...

17:06.721 --> 17:08.201
Is there something
not right with the body?

17:09.680 --> 17:11.204
He's feeling guilty

17:11.247 --> 17:13.510
about being happy right now.

17:13.554 --> 17:14.729
You know?

17:18.167 --> 17:21.214
Life goes on, Gray. It has to.

17:21.257 --> 17:22.650
For all of us.

17:22.693 --> 17:24.652
But the artisan did
a beautiful job with the body.

17:24.695 --> 17:26.697
She used the Soong Method,

17:26.741 --> 17:29.439
named after the 24th century
cyberneticist who developed it.

17:29.483 --> 17:32.225
This is 800-year-old technology?

17:32.268 --> 17:35.619
Maybe I should get
a synth body when I die, too.

17:35.663 --> 17:37.969
We could live forever.

17:38.013 --> 17:40.233
Well, not likely.

17:40.276 --> 17:42.365
But the process was attempted
a number of times

17:42.409 --> 17:45.934
after Dr. Soong first used it
on a... a Starfleet admiral--

17:45.977 --> 17:47.414
Picard was his name--

17:47.457 --> 17:49.155
but the success rate was so low

17:49.198 --> 17:51.418
that eventually people
just stopped trying.

17:51.461 --> 17:53.942
What...
Should we be worried?

17:53.985 --> 17:55.857
Well, the fact that
Gray's consciousness

17:55.900 --> 17:58.120
has already survived transfer
to a new host once

17:58.164 --> 17:59.817
seems to be a good sign.

17:59.861 --> 18:01.167
But we should ask Guardian Xi

18:01.210 --> 18:02.559
once the synthetic body's ready.

18:03.821 --> 18:06.041
When I incorporate,

18:06.085 --> 18:09.044
will the body age and die?

18:09.088 --> 18:10.437
Like I would have before?

18:10.480 --> 18:14.136
Uh, he's asking if
this body will get old.

18:14.180 --> 18:16.965
You know, like, gray hair,

18:17.008 --> 18:19.141
the long, scraggly nose hairs,

18:19.185 --> 18:20.273
the pot belly and all.

18:20.316 --> 18:21.578
So not what I said.

18:21.622 --> 18:23.406
It will age in the same way.

18:23.450 --> 18:24.973
For better or for worse.

18:27.932 --> 18:29.847
GRAY:
Can we get rid of the mole?

18:29.891 --> 18:31.719
I thought
you stopped hating that.

18:31.762 --> 18:34.635
I just asked, because...

18:34.678 --> 18:37.551
transitioning, it's like I had
bigger things to think about,

18:37.594 --> 18:40.858
but if I get another chance

18:40.902 --> 18:43.426
to remake my body, then...

18:43.470 --> 18:45.385
why not get rid of
all the things

18:45.428 --> 18:48.039
that aren't totally "me,"
you know?

18:51.130 --> 18:52.609
He wants to lose the mole.

18:52.653 --> 18:54.655
Oh. Well, that's why we're here,

18:54.698 --> 18:56.004
to make
last-minute adjustments.

18:56.047 --> 18:57.136
[Adira chuckles]

18:59.050 --> 19:01.444
[trilling]

19:22.248 --> 19:24.467
[door chimes]

19:24.511 --> 19:25.773
Come.

19:28.950 --> 19:31.213
Oh. You added a holo.

19:31.257 --> 19:32.867
[bird squawks]

19:32.910 --> 19:34.651
Helps to get away sometimes.

19:36.044 --> 19:37.959
Is this Ni'Var?

19:38.002 --> 19:39.787
Cliffs of Surak.

19:41.702 --> 19:43.530
That's Lake Yuron.

19:45.096 --> 19:49.100
It looks the same
as it did when I was a child,

19:49.144 --> 19:51.059
when this was Vulcan.

19:51.102 --> 19:53.322
I used to run away...

19:53.366 --> 19:55.150
I used to run away here.

19:55.194 --> 19:58.153
When I was getting used
to my parents being gone.

20:02.505 --> 20:05.465
Uh, you wished to speak
with me about Mr. Booker?

20:06.901 --> 20:08.294
Take me home, Zora.

20:08.337 --> 20:09.860
ZORA:
Yes, Captain.

20:13.212 --> 20:15.562
The computer's now Zora?

20:15.605 --> 20:17.390
Picked the name herself.

20:17.433 --> 20:19.653
-Oh.
-[Burnham chuckles]

20:19.696 --> 20:21.611
Please.

20:28.357 --> 20:31.099
Book plans to fly to the anomaly

20:31.142 --> 20:33.406
with or without my permission.

20:33.449 --> 20:35.582
Well, that would
certainly be deleterious

20:35.625 --> 20:37.236
to your relationship.

20:38.889 --> 20:40.456
The captain in me knows

20:40.500 --> 20:43.024
that he's the right choice
for the mission.

20:43.067 --> 20:45.418
He knows it, too.

20:45.461 --> 20:47.246
But...

20:48.464 --> 20:50.727
I've seen him...

20:50.771 --> 20:53.991
not sleeping, not eating...

20:54.035 --> 20:58.126
Mr. Booker's expertise
with his ship

20:58.169 --> 21:01.129
does make him supremely well
suited for this particular task.

21:01.172 --> 21:03.131
More so than Commander Detmer,

21:03.174 --> 21:05.394
despite her considerable skills.

21:05.438 --> 21:07.962
His planet was destroyed.

21:08.005 --> 21:11.357
Well, billions more lives
will be at risk

21:11.400 --> 21:13.054
until we understand
the anomaly

21:13.097 --> 21:14.577
well enough
to predict its path.

21:14.621 --> 21:16.536
So you think
I should let him go.

21:16.579 --> 21:19.756
As do you, I believe.

21:19.800 --> 21:24.326
Yeah, but your personal feelings
complicate your decision.

21:24.370 --> 21:27.329
What if he takes
unnecessary risks?

21:27.373 --> 21:30.332
I wonder, then,
if added safety measures

21:30.376 --> 21:32.900
would be helpful
to all involved.

21:32.943 --> 21:36.512
I have some ideas,
if that would be helpful.

21:38.906 --> 21:42.518
Have I mentioned
I am glad you're back?

21:43.563 --> 21:45.304
I believe you have.

21:46.827 --> 21:49.133
You want to send
the only two people

21:49.177 --> 21:51.397
who can operate
the spore drive, together,

21:51.440 --> 21:53.137
into the accretion cloud

21:53.181 --> 21:55.270
of an unknown
astrophysical entity?

21:55.314 --> 21:57.751
You might as well
blow me out an airlock.

21:57.794 --> 21:59.274
Oh.

22:00.623 --> 22:02.625
Too soon?
Probably too soon.

22:02.669 --> 22:05.454
But still, it's madness.

22:05.498 --> 22:08.152
Yes, which is why
you'll be going as a holo.

22:08.196 --> 22:11.242
Oh. Well, in that case...

22:11.286 --> 22:13.941
Your body will be right here
on Discoverythe entire time.

22:13.984 --> 22:16.509
The anomaly creates
enormous distortions.

22:16.552 --> 22:18.424
We might not be able
to maintain a holo signal.

22:18.467 --> 22:21.340
Right, which is why
we'll be using a tether

22:21.383 --> 22:23.820
to help Book's ship maintain
proximity to Discovery.

22:23.864 --> 22:26.780
And, if we have to,
we will use it to pull him out.

22:29.957 --> 22:32.742
And I want you on the bridge,
listening in on comms.

22:32.786 --> 22:34.875
Let me know if you have
any reason for concern.

22:34.918 --> 22:36.093
Yes, Captain.

22:41.142 --> 22:42.752
"Blow me out an airlock"?

22:42.796 --> 22:44.406
It was humor.

22:44.450 --> 22:46.147
Neural link.

22:46.190 --> 22:47.409
You'll feel everything
on Book's ship

22:47.453 --> 22:48.889
as if you were really there.

22:48.932 --> 22:50.760
If, for whatever reason,
you remove this transmitter,

22:50.804 --> 22:53.197
you'll be right back here...
What's wrong?

22:54.677 --> 22:58.202
I wouldn't know what to say
to Book on a good day.

22:59.682 --> 23:02.119
Well, when you lost me, what did
you want people to say to you?

23:02.163 --> 23:05.427
It's not nearly the same thing.

23:05.471 --> 23:07.560
Grief is grief.

23:07.603 --> 23:09.692
And everyone moves
through it differently.

23:09.736 --> 23:11.564
Let Book guide you.

23:11.607 --> 23:13.740
Are you sure?

23:13.783 --> 23:16.917
Things have been
seriously awkward with him

23:16.960 --> 23:19.572
since he jumped Discovery
to the dilithium planet.

23:20.747 --> 23:22.618
Just trust your instincts.

23:22.662 --> 23:24.446
You should know better
than to say that to me.

23:24.490 --> 23:26.361
You're better
than you think you are.

23:29.451 --> 23:31.584
STAMETS:
Book. Hi.

23:31.627 --> 23:34.369
Uh, sorry, I'm...

23:34.413 --> 23:37.154
-still getting used to this,
uh, new tech.
-[Grudge growls]

23:37.198 --> 23:39.287
We're leaving soon. Get ready.

23:39.330 --> 23:40.810
It's so smooth.

23:40.854 --> 23:43.639
I-I thought I'd be able
to tell the difference, but...

23:43.683 --> 23:45.685
Wait for us to crash,
then we'll see.

23:45.728 --> 23:47.991
Right.

23:50.211 --> 23:53.997
So, um,
I've been meaning to ask you.

23:54.041 --> 23:57.653
When-when you're using
the spore drive interface,

23:57.697 --> 24:01.309
do you ever feel...
cramps in your hands?

24:01.352 --> 24:04.573
Or, uh, tingles in your arms?

24:05.748 --> 24:07.358
No?

24:09.056 --> 24:10.274
Okay...

24:10.318 --> 24:11.319
Hey, girl.

24:11.362 --> 24:12.538
-[growls]
-I wouldn't do that.

24:12.581 --> 24:14.670
Holos freak her out.
She can't smell you.

24:16.716 --> 24:18.326
Come on, darling.

24:18.369 --> 24:20.589
-Let's get you secured.
-[meows]

24:24.201 --> 24:27.204
Look, uh, I get it.

24:27.248 --> 24:30.381
We're not friends. [chuckles]

24:30.425 --> 24:33.515
But... I know
you've been through a lot.

24:33.559 --> 24:36.126
So, uh...

24:36.170 --> 24:38.651
if there's anything
I can do to help out or...

24:38.694 --> 24:40.391
Maybe stop talking.

24:40.435 --> 24:41.610
That'd be a good start.

24:41.654 --> 24:42.916
Excuse me?

24:42.959 --> 24:44.352
I don't need a tether

24:44.395 --> 24:45.614
and I sure as hell
don't need a minder.

24:45.658 --> 24:46.963
I'm here for the data.

24:47.007 --> 24:48.487
You wouldn't know
what to look for.

24:48.530 --> 24:49.923
Fine.

24:52.316 --> 24:54.493
I fly. You scan.

24:59.019 --> 25:01.151
BURNHAM:
Owosekun, how's it looking
out there?

25:01.195 --> 25:04.372
Gravitational fluctuations
remain within safe parameters.

25:04.415 --> 25:06.200
All right, Book,
we're good to go.

25:06.243 --> 25:08.724
Detmer, bring us as close
as we can safely get.

25:08.768 --> 25:10.117
He'll take his ship
in from there.

25:10.160 --> 25:11.684
Aye, Captain.

25:18.473 --> 25:19.692
Rhys?

25:19.735 --> 25:21.345
Tether's holding, Captain.

25:21.389 --> 25:23.478
Keep an eye out
for micro-strains.

25:23.522 --> 25:25.393
Any sign it's failing
and we're pulling him out.

25:25.436 --> 25:26.873
RHYS:
Aye, Captain.

25:26.916 --> 25:28.309
BOOK [over comm]:
Approaching the dust layer.

25:32.531 --> 25:34.358
-You good, Book?
-Yup.

25:35.359 --> 25:36.839
Going deeper in.

25:36.883 --> 25:38.537
[computer beeps]

25:39.625 --> 25:41.061
You said "dust layer."

25:41.104 --> 25:42.845
Some pretty large
chunks in here.

25:42.889 --> 25:46.588
Well, it did just pass through
a planetary system.

25:48.242 --> 25:49.722
I'm sorry.

25:52.594 --> 25:54.030
Can your shields handle this?

25:54.074 --> 25:56.250
Holding steady so far.

26:05.738 --> 26:07.348
[child laughing]

26:08.784 --> 26:11.482
STAMETS:
Hey. Are you okay?

26:13.397 --> 26:15.051
Don't ask me that again.

26:16.836 --> 26:18.707
BOOK:
We're through the outer layer.

26:18.751 --> 26:19.926
-Stamets has started scanning.

26:19.969 --> 26:20.970
-BURNHAM: Tilly?
-Captain,

26:21.014 --> 26:22.189
we're about to be hit

26:22.232 --> 26:24.147
by a subspace
gravitational wave...

26:24.191 --> 26:26.019
[all gasping]

26:27.368 --> 26:28.761
MALE [over comms]:
Gravity generator malfunction!

26:28.804 --> 26:30.023
Status report!

26:30.066 --> 26:32.112
-I can't reach my station.
-Zora!

26:32.155 --> 26:33.983
ZORA:
Artificial gravity generators

26:34.027 --> 26:35.202
are unable to compensate
for extreme...

26:35.245 --> 26:36.333
How long will they last?

26:36.377 --> 26:38.118
ZORA:
It will pass in... Now.

26:38.161 --> 26:39.772
[grunting]

26:44.124 --> 26:45.995
[groaning]

26:46.996 --> 26:48.911
Is everybody okay?

26:50.260 --> 26:51.958
That wasn't supposed to happen.

26:52.001 --> 26:53.002
Red alert.

26:53.046 --> 26:54.917
Let's find out why it did.

27:02.142 --> 27:04.144
Where did it come from? Did we
get pulled into the yellow zone?

27:04.187 --> 27:05.536
No. We're still at
a safe distance.

27:05.580 --> 27:06.755
How's the tether?

27:06.799 --> 27:08.104
Holding steady, Captain.

27:08.148 --> 27:09.236
Damage report?

27:09.279 --> 27:10.585
Port nacelle needs repairing.

27:10.629 --> 27:11.978
Power failure
in Engineering,

27:12.021 --> 27:13.588
hull integrity at 55% percent.

27:13.632 --> 27:15.416
Discoverywill not survive
much more of that.

27:15.459 --> 27:17.244
-Your chin.
-BURNHAM: Get Adira up here.

27:17.287 --> 27:19.028
I want you two to figure out
what just happened,

27:19.072 --> 27:20.987
-and if it's going
to happen again.
-Aye, Captain.

27:21.030 --> 27:22.466
-I need to finish.
-Go. Make it fast.

27:22.510 --> 27:23.859
Stamets.

27:23.903 --> 27:25.295
What's the status
on those scans?

27:26.470 --> 27:28.472
Whoa. It's going slow,

27:28.516 --> 27:30.170
but I'm getting
a ton of data.

27:31.214 --> 27:33.434
Can't you make it
go steadier?

27:33.477 --> 27:34.565
You're kidding, right?

27:34.609 --> 27:35.915
I'm workin' magic over here.

27:35.958 --> 27:37.568
Well, then,
magically keep it steady.

27:37.612 --> 27:39.440
[Stamets shouts]

27:39.483 --> 27:41.485
Damn it. I lost navigation.

27:41.529 --> 27:42.617
We're pulling you out.

27:42.661 --> 27:44.575
No.

27:44.619 --> 27:46.099
We need this data.
We need answers.

27:46.142 --> 27:47.230
No, Book...

27:47.274 --> 27:49.015
I-I could really use the time.

27:51.713 --> 27:53.933
-How much time, exactly?
-Uh...

27:53.976 --> 27:55.804
Let's call it-- ten minutes.

27:55.848 --> 27:57.327
We will do our best.

27:59.025 --> 28:00.766
I need to know if one of those
fluctuations will happen again,

28:00.809 --> 28:03.029
-Tilly.
-On it.

28:03.072 --> 28:04.683
[shouts]

28:05.771 --> 28:07.860
You have a cracked rib.

28:07.903 --> 28:10.079
Gravitational fluctuations
have exceeded

28:10.123 --> 28:11.559
all the anticipated parameters.

28:11.602 --> 28:13.604
Something has changed.
We-we need to figure out what.

28:13.648 --> 28:15.476
I'm working on a new
predictive algorithm,

28:15.519 --> 28:16.825
but the data's so limited
that I...

28:16.869 --> 28:18.609
Well, did you include
Nalas's gravimetric data

28:18.653 --> 28:19.785
from the station
in your calculations?

28:19.828 --> 28:21.177
Of course.
I've done this before.

28:21.221 --> 28:22.178
-You don't have
to check my work.
-TILLY: Hey!

28:22.222 --> 28:23.223
You don't get to do that, okay?

28:23.266 --> 28:24.441
We've all done this before;

28:24.485 --> 28:25.747
we still double
and triple check our work.

28:25.791 --> 28:27.096
Now, make sure
that you've included

28:27.140 --> 28:29.098
the irregular gravitational
strain on the ship.

28:29.142 --> 28:31.013
Please. Thank you.

28:32.841 --> 28:35.888
Sorry. I'm, like,
Stamets-ing right now.

28:35.931 --> 28:38.238
We're all under
a lot of pressure.

28:38.281 --> 28:41.110
And what happened on
that station was...

28:41.154 --> 28:43.634
And you know Adira's just trying
to impress you, right?

28:44.853 --> 28:46.028
[Tilly chuckles]

28:46.072 --> 28:47.682
They really look up to you.

28:49.336 --> 28:51.425
Uh... Okay, uh,
I-I've adjusted the numbers

28:51.468 --> 28:52.774
to account for
the gravimetric variant

28:52.818 --> 28:54.689
and... we have a problem.

28:54.733 --> 28:56.125
TILLY:
Captain! Uh, good news.

28:56.169 --> 28:57.910
We know when the next
disturbance is gonna hit.

28:57.953 --> 28:59.781
Bad news--
it's in two seconds.

28:59.825 --> 29:00.782
Everybody brace!

29:05.787 --> 29:09.225
-[groaning]
-[alert whooping]

29:12.707 --> 29:15.362

29:17.930 --> 29:20.802
Structural and power failures
on decks 14 through 16.

29:20.846 --> 29:22.804
Another one of those and the
artificial gravity generators

29:22.848 --> 29:24.197
will give out completely.

29:24.240 --> 29:26.112
If the hull doesn't
open before it.

29:26.155 --> 29:27.766
-You okay?
-Yeah.

29:27.809 --> 29:29.245
Tilly, how much longer
do we have?

29:29.289 --> 29:30.856
Four minutes.
Then a minute and a half.

29:30.899 --> 29:33.032
-Then 40 seconds.
-Why so irregular?

29:33.075 --> 29:34.990
-We don't know yet.
-Get back to it.

29:35.034 --> 29:36.513
Aye, Captain.

29:36.557 --> 29:38.080
We have to pull Book out.

29:38.124 --> 29:39.255
Or we can release the tether

29:39.299 --> 29:40.604
and allow them
to continue their work.

29:40.648 --> 29:41.997
He doesn't have navigation.

29:42.041 --> 29:44.130
And without that data, Captain,
we have nothing.

29:46.349 --> 29:48.438
Discoveryhas to pull back.
Where are you with scans?

29:50.223 --> 29:52.138
I need, uh, five more minutes.

29:52.181 --> 29:53.313
Make it three.

29:53.356 --> 29:55.228
I-I'd be lucky
to get it in five.

29:55.271 --> 29:57.360
What if we come back?

29:57.404 --> 29:59.101
It'll take a week
to fix this ship.

29:59.145 --> 30:01.800
Stamets, can you do your
analysis with what you have?

30:01.843 --> 30:05.194
I-I won't know until
I can get into the data.

30:05.238 --> 30:07.849
And in the meantime,
this... thing

30:07.893 --> 30:09.285
will just be
roaming around and...

30:09.329 --> 30:11.679
who knows how much
more damage it can do?

30:18.729 --> 30:20.209
Hey.

30:20.253 --> 30:21.471
Book.

30:21.515 --> 30:22.951
What the hell is
going on with you?

30:22.995 --> 30:24.735
They're talking about
pulling us out.

30:26.085 --> 30:27.521
Yeah, that's not happening.

30:27.564 --> 30:29.697
We're not leaving
without the data.

30:29.740 --> 30:31.786
You have to release the tether.

30:33.266 --> 30:34.963
Does it sound like
he's thinking clearly?

30:35.007 --> 30:36.399
In these circumstances,

30:36.443 --> 30:38.924
it's impossible
to distinguish between stress

30:38.967 --> 30:40.839
and emotional instability.

30:40.882 --> 30:42.841
BOOK:
Michael.

30:42.884 --> 30:45.278
We can do this.

Rhys, let him go.

31:00.293 --> 31:02.773
Aye, Captain.

31:04.645 --> 31:06.516

find another way to get him out

31:39.158 --> 31:41.290
before his ship
fails completely.

31:41.334 --> 31:42.378
Start thinking.

31:42.422 --> 31:43.597
DETMER and RHYS:
Aye, Captain.

31:44.990 --> 31:46.992
Uh, three more minutes
for the scan.

31:47.035 --> 31:48.384
You said that
three minutes ago.

31:48.428 --> 31:49.603
Oh, whoa! Watch it!

31:51.213 --> 31:52.519
What is that?

31:52.562 --> 31:55.217
Is that the--
the boson-energy-transfer unit?

31:55.261 --> 31:56.479
That's the one.

we're losing engines.

32:01.180 --> 32:02.224
Grab a phase discriminator.

32:02.268 --> 32:03.791
-Where?
-Over there.

32:03.834 --> 32:05.967
You say that like
it should be obvious.

32:06.011 --> 32:07.490
Just pretend like
your life depends on it.

32:07.534 --> 32:09.101
You know? Like mine does.

32:10.406 --> 32:13.105
You know, I-I was told
to-to follow your lead,

32:13.148 --> 32:15.107
that-that you would let me know
what you needed.

32:15.150 --> 32:16.369
What are you talking about?

32:17.413 --> 32:19.154
I'm-I'm talking about...

me, trying to be sensitive.

32:22.027 --> 32:24.159
And you being you.

32:24.203 --> 32:25.944
You do realize
you've spoken to me more today

32:25.987 --> 32:27.858
than you have in the past,
what, five months?

32:27.902 --> 32:28.947
That's not true.

32:30.426 --> 32:31.950
Ever since you found out
I could run the spore drive.

32:31.993 --> 32:33.603
Your ego got bruised
and then you blamed me.

32:33.647 --> 32:34.778
Nothing to do with it.

32:34.822 --> 32:35.997
What is it, then?

32:38.695 --> 32:42.221
You remind me
of how helpless I was.

32:45.224 --> 32:46.616
When I look at you,

32:46.660 --> 32:49.706
all I can see is how close I got

32:49.750 --> 32:51.447
to losing everything.

32:51.491 --> 32:52.840
Again.

32:54.842 --> 32:57.845
You were the one
who saved my family.

32:57.888 --> 33:00.891
I wasn't able
to do anything and...

33:00.935 --> 33:02.981
I hate that feeling.

33:05.896 --> 33:07.681
SHIP COMPUTER:
Engines at 30%.

33:07.724 --> 33:08.987
Data scan complete.

33:09.030 --> 33:10.989
Go.
Pull off the neurotransmitter

33:11.032 --> 33:12.991
and get back to Discovery.
Start analyzing.

33:13.034 --> 33:14.470
-I can't.
-What?

33:14.514 --> 33:17.865
The-the distortions that keep
interfering with my holo--

33:17.908 --> 33:20.259
I haven't been able to send
any of the data back.

33:20.302 --> 33:23.479
It lives here,
on this ship...

33:23.523 --> 33:25.873
and nowhere else.

33:29.094 --> 33:30.573
Captain, we've got something.

33:30.617 --> 33:33.228
Okay, uh, this is what

33:33.272 --> 33:35.665
the subspace
gravitational waves look like

33:35.709 --> 33:37.406
where Book is.
Whatever's making them

33:37.450 --> 33:39.539
hit us harder,
they're hitting him harder, too.

33:39.582 --> 33:41.323
Yikes, right?

33:41.367 --> 33:43.760
But we think, in theory,
Book could catch

33:43.804 --> 33:45.501
one of these waves
and sort of...

33:45.545 --> 33:47.416
-ride it out.
-[whistles]

33:47.460 --> 33:49.157
SARU:
Mr. Booker's engines
are losing power.

33:49.201 --> 33:51.681
How could he even attempt
such a thing?

33:51.725 --> 33:53.727
Newtonian mechanics.

33:53.770 --> 33:55.816
Basic application
of fluid dynamics.

33:55.859 --> 33:58.558
I used to kite-surf the biggest
breaks on Manark IV.

33:58.601 --> 34:00.081
It's the same basic idea.

34:00.125 --> 34:03.867
If Book accelerated
into the distortion here,

34:03.911 --> 34:05.478
the buoyancy will take care
of the rest.

34:05.521 --> 34:06.783
But without
navigational sensors,

34:06.827 --> 34:08.742
he won't be able to gauge
the right angle--

34:08.785 --> 34:10.439
he can't just feel it.

34:10.483 --> 34:12.528
Maybe there's a way he can.

34:12.572 --> 34:14.139
Tilly, can you turn
this holo rendering

34:14.182 --> 34:15.227
into programmable matter?

34:15.270 --> 34:17.055
Oh, you bet.

34:17.098 --> 34:18.926
Uh... why would I do that?

34:18.969 --> 34:20.145
You want me to do what?

34:20.188 --> 34:21.711
Like kite-surfing.

34:21.755 --> 34:23.409
If you hit it at
just the right angle,

34:23.452 --> 34:25.280
it will carry your ship out.

34:25.324 --> 34:26.542
I'm flying blind.

34:26.586 --> 34:27.891
I'll tell you when.

34:27.935 --> 34:30.111
You just have
to follow my mark exactly.

34:30.155 --> 34:32.766
-Got it.
-Engines at 20%.

34:32.809 --> 34:34.507
You think that repair will hold?

34:34.550 --> 34:36.509
It's barely stitched together.

34:36.552 --> 34:38.119
It could blow any time.

34:38.163 --> 34:39.294
Glad I asked.

34:40.339 --> 34:41.862
On my mark.

34:42.863 --> 34:44.517
Get ready...

34:44.560 --> 34:46.301
[whirring increasing]

34:46.345 --> 34:47.302
Now!

34:47.346 --> 34:48.999
-You sure?
-Go!

34:55.441 --> 34:57.399
What happened? Book?

34:57.443 --> 34:58.400
BOOK:
I missed it.

34:58.444 --> 34:59.401
Damn.

34:59.445 --> 35:00.446
Listen.

35:00.489 --> 35:01.882
Another will come.

35:01.925 --> 35:03.057
It'll be tight, but--

35:03.101 --> 35:04.667
but there is enough power
to the engine

35:04.711 --> 35:06.104
to give it one more shot.

35:09.150 --> 35:10.804
You get to try again.

35:10.847 --> 35:11.805
That's something.

35:11.848 --> 35:13.023
We'll-we'll try this again.

35:13.067 --> 35:14.895
It's over.

35:14.938 --> 35:16.375
It's not.

35:18.986 --> 35:20.422
Pull off the transmitter.

35:20.466 --> 35:21.902
No.

35:21.945 --> 35:24.513
You're not even here.

35:26.254 --> 35:28.430
No one's here.

35:29.997 --> 35:32.608
I'm here. We're all here.

35:35.394 --> 35:37.091
BURNHAM:
Another distortion will come

35:37.135 --> 35:39.180
in less than two minutes.

35:39.224 --> 35:41.008
Are you ready?

35:43.967 --> 35:46.187
Book? Are you there?

35:50.452 --> 35:51.845
Book.

36:00.941 --> 36:03.030
BURNHAM:
Book, we don't have
a lot of time.

36:03.813 --> 36:05.075
Captain...

36:05.119 --> 36:06.468
I think he may need

36:06.512 --> 36:08.644
a little more help
with this one.

36:11.081 --> 36:13.432
Perhaps now is
an appropriate time

36:13.475 --> 36:15.129
for you to set aside
the captain

36:15.173 --> 36:16.826
in favor of the partner?

36:23.224 --> 36:25.183
Bryce, open a private channel,
please.

36:28.490 --> 36:30.188
Hey, Book.

36:31.798 --> 36:33.974
It's just us now.

36:34.017 --> 36:35.715
You and me.

36:35.758 --> 36:38.196
And I need you
to listen to me:

36:39.762 --> 36:41.764
You couldn't have saved them.

36:42.896 --> 36:44.637
There is nothing
you could've done.

36:44.680 --> 36:46.204
You couldn't have known.

36:50.817 --> 36:52.471
The birds...

36:54.255 --> 36:56.605
The way they took to the sky...

36:59.782 --> 37:02.220
I should have sensed it.

37:02.263 --> 37:04.178
No.

37:05.310 --> 37:07.529
This isn't your fault.

37:07.573 --> 37:10.880
I should've taken them with me.

37:10.924 --> 37:14.536
Kyheem...

37:14.580 --> 37:16.930
Leto...

37:16.973 --> 37:19.237
I failed, Michael.

37:20.673 --> 37:23.066
I failed them.

37:23.110 --> 37:25.417
I know it feels that way.

37:26.983 --> 37:29.159
But you didn't.

37:29.203 --> 37:33.033
You didn't fail them.

37:33.076 --> 37:36.036
And I won't fail you,

37:36.079 --> 37:37.429
now or ever.

37:37.472 --> 37:40.258
I am with you.

37:40.301 --> 37:43.173
The entire crew is with you.

37:43.217 --> 37:45.480
We're gonna do everything
in our power

37:45.524 --> 37:47.700
to make sure
you make it back safely.

37:47.743 --> 37:51.573
But I need you to trust me
right now.

37:51.617 --> 37:53.183
Please.

37:58.798 --> 38:00.843
â™ª

38:13.334 --> 38:15.293
Just close your eyes.

38:15.336 --> 38:18.078
Listen to my voice.

38:18.121 --> 38:20.210
Stay with us.

38:21.864 --> 38:23.866
Stay with me.

38:25.128 --> 38:27.261
I'll tell you when to go,

38:27.305 --> 38:29.350
and when I do, I need you to

38:29.394 --> 38:31.657
gun it
with whatever you have left.

38:33.006 --> 38:35.443
Another distortion
wave is coming.

38:36.836 --> 38:39.229
Just ride it out.

38:40.927 --> 38:42.363
Get ready.

38:43.495 --> 38:45.018
Open your eyes.

38:47.150 --> 38:48.630
Now.

39:03.776 --> 39:06.474
[exhales]

39:09.303 --> 39:11.044
Any sign?

39:11.087 --> 39:12.654
OWOSEKUN:
Not yet.

39:20.923 --> 39:22.534
[sighs]

39:22.577 --> 39:24.579
BOOK:
I'm free. I'm clear.

39:27.713 --> 39:29.454
Transmitting scan data now.

39:29.497 --> 39:31.151
It's time to come home.

39:33.283 --> 39:36.374
And well done, Commander Bryce.

39:36.417 --> 39:39.159
May we all cultivate
such life-saving hobbies.

39:39.202 --> 39:40.508
Thank you, Mr. Saru.

39:40.552 --> 39:44.904
[cheering, applauding]

39:44.947 --> 39:46.296
-Nice work, you.
-Oh.

39:46.340 --> 39:47.602
Really good work.

39:48.995 --> 39:51.389
Thanks.

39:57.830 --> 40:00.093
BOOK:
Cut it close there, for sure.

40:01.660 --> 40:04.880
Well, this... data
should be a gold mine.

40:07.579 --> 40:09.494
Oh, don't look at me.

40:09.537 --> 40:12.540
That was all you.
I just drove this thing.

40:16.762 --> 40:18.807
Thank you.

40:18.851 --> 40:21.070
For saving my family.

40:24.465 --> 40:26.859
I'm going to figure
this thing out. For you.

40:27.990 --> 40:30.950
Whatever it takes.

40:30.993 --> 40:32.342
I promise.

40:35.650 --> 40:37.739
You know...

40:37.783 --> 40:40.481
I do get arm tingles
in the spore drive.

40:40.525 --> 40:42.352
Yeah.

40:42.396 --> 40:43.963
Weirdest thing.

40:44.006 --> 40:45.355
[chuckles]

40:49.490 --> 40:52.711
I'm going to take this off now.

41:06.768 --> 41:08.553
CULBER:
Welcome back.

41:11.991 --> 41:13.383
MALE [over comms]:
Lieutenant Callahan,

41:13.427 --> 41:14.776
-please report to Engineering.
-Oh. Hey.

41:14.820 --> 41:16.256
Hi, sorry.

41:16.299 --> 41:18.998
Um, I just wanted to thank you,

41:19.041 --> 41:21.957
uh, for your advice,
um, with Adira.

41:22.001 --> 41:23.916
It can be hard for them

41:23.959 --> 41:26.527
to let others see past
how bright they are.

41:26.571 --> 41:27.833
Yeah.

41:27.876 --> 41:30.183
You have a very,
uh, light touch with people.

41:30.226 --> 41:32.185
I really admire that.

41:32.228 --> 41:33.969
You do, too.

41:34.013 --> 41:36.145
Usually.

41:36.189 --> 41:38.887
Yeah. I think, um,
you were right

41:38.931 --> 41:41.063
about me feeling pressure.

41:41.107 --> 41:43.849
Um, not about the station,
but...

41:43.892 --> 41:46.416
I mean, don't get me wrong,
that was just...

41:46.460 --> 41:47.896
unbelievably shitty.

41:47.940 --> 41:50.551
-But, um...
-But this is something...
bigger?

41:50.595 --> 41:53.946
Yeah, like...

41:53.989 --> 41:57.427
Things just don't f... feel
the same way that they used to.

41:57.471 --> 41:59.517
Like...

41:59.560 --> 42:02.128
I don't know,
something's off. Or, um...

42:02.171 --> 42:03.825
I'm off.

42:03.869 --> 42:05.261
Uh...

42:07.525 --> 42:09.222
I don't know,
I was kind of hoping that

42:09.265 --> 42:11.441
we could talk about it sometime.

42:11.485 --> 42:13.574
Like, talk-talk.

42:13.618 --> 42:16.490
Like, uh... professionally?

42:16.534 --> 42:18.187
Of course.

42:18.231 --> 42:20.450
And whatever it is,
we'll figure it out together.

42:20.494 --> 42:22.104
Hmm?

42:22.148 --> 42:23.758
Thanks.

42:23.802 --> 42:26.065
Okay. [laughs]
That wasn't so hard.

42:26.108 --> 42:27.545
-Whew.
-Just... little awkward.

42:27.588 --> 42:28.937
Not-- But not hard.

42:28.981 --> 42:31.200
-You did good.
-Thank you.

42:31.244 --> 42:33.420
I'm gonna go
dig into that data.

42:33.463 --> 42:34.769
-All right.
-All right.

42:34.813 --> 42:36.945
-Go save the world.
-Oh, I will.

42:46.302 --> 42:48.174
[exhales]

42:55.964 --> 42:58.227
-You were kind of a...
-Oh, my God.

42:58.271 --> 43:00.882
...big deal today,
you know that?

43:00.926 --> 43:03.145
Your algorithms are...

43:03.189 --> 43:05.800
mathematical works of art.

43:07.236 --> 43:09.238
Thank you. [laughs]

43:09.282 --> 43:12.067
I guess I, um... made waves.

43:13.242 --> 43:14.461
Okay, no.

43:14.504 --> 43:16.463
[both laugh]

43:20.510 --> 43:21.773
What is it?

43:21.816 --> 43:26.386
You-you got to see
your body today.

43:26.429 --> 43:28.954
Which is huge

43:28.997 --> 43:30.520
and I'm-I'm so happy

43:30.564 --> 43:31.870
that you get
to incorporate soon.

43:31.913 --> 43:35.917
I hear a "but"...

43:35.961 --> 43:37.397
[laughing]:
No.

43:37.440 --> 43:40.313
It's okay.

43:40.356 --> 43:41.749
You can tell me.

43:43.708 --> 43:45.231
Nalas...

43:45.274 --> 43:48.277
everything that, uh, happened,

43:48.321 --> 43:51.541
you know, the suddenness of it,

43:51.585 --> 43:55.545
and just the whole awful thing,

43:55.589 --> 43:59.941
um, reminded me
of what happened to you.

43:59.985 --> 44:02.422
It's just been on my mind.

44:03.728 --> 44:05.120
[laughs] I...

44:05.164 --> 44:07.035
I didn't want to bring it up
on such a joyful day,

44:07.079 --> 44:08.994
so I'm-I'm really sorry.

44:09.037 --> 44:11.039
I don't even know how to begin
to talk about this.

44:12.911 --> 44:15.435
You just did.

44:17.089 --> 44:19.961
You're really good at this,
you know?

44:20.005 --> 44:23.835
The... the being there
for people.

44:23.878 --> 44:26.272
You always have been, so...

44:26.315 --> 44:28.578
Everyone's got to have
their thing.

44:28.622 --> 44:30.972
[both chuckle]

44:31.016 --> 44:32.408
Yeah.

44:33.453 --> 44:35.934
And you're gonna make
a great Guardian someday.

44:46.727 --> 44:47.815
Hey.

44:48.947 --> 44:51.166
Hey.

44:51.210 --> 44:53.342
Hell of a day.

44:53.386 --> 44:55.431
[scoffs]

44:55.475 --> 44:57.869
Brilliant flying.

44:59.131 --> 45:01.263
You were right.

45:01.307 --> 45:03.701
I wasn't ready.

45:09.794 --> 45:11.709
But you did it.

45:12.927 --> 45:15.277
And you trusted me.

45:16.322 --> 45:18.106
Thank you for that.

45:23.416 --> 45:24.983
I keep seeing him.

45:25.026 --> 45:27.246
Leto.

45:30.902 --> 45:34.601
I don't know if he knew...

45:34.644 --> 45:38.126
if I ever let him know
how much I loved him.

45:40.563 --> 45:43.828
You know, for so many years,

45:43.871 --> 45:46.482
I told myself
I didn't need family.

45:46.526 --> 45:48.310
Didn't need Kwejian.

45:49.311 --> 45:52.793
But then I found
my brother again...

45:52.837 --> 45:55.143
the nephew
I didn't even know I had...

45:57.015 --> 45:59.452
And when I looked at Leto...

46:01.584 --> 46:03.456
I saw a new beginning.

46:03.499 --> 46:05.545
For all of us.

46:06.894 --> 46:10.202
We could give him a future

46:10.245 --> 46:12.204
where there was a home...

46:12.247 --> 46:15.250
and family...

46:15.294 --> 46:17.296
and love.

46:18.558 --> 46:20.908
And nothing he couldn't do.

46:25.957 --> 46:27.915
I'm sorry.

46:27.959 --> 46:30.309
They're gone, Michael.
[sniffles]

46:35.314 --> 46:37.316
[crying]

46:55.116 --> 46:57.336
Mr. Saru.

47:00.513 --> 47:01.775
Lieutenant.

47:01.819 --> 47:03.690
Has the data
from Mr. Booker's ship

47:03.733 --> 47:05.300
shed new light on
the nature of this threat?

47:05.344 --> 47:08.390
Not yet. We still have an
Everest-sized mountain of data

47:08.434 --> 47:10.131
to analyze.

47:10.175 --> 47:11.785
Oh, uh...

47:11.829 --> 47:14.701
Earth mountain. It's very big.

47:14.744 --> 47:18.400
Doesn't matter. Point being,
I did find something.

47:18.444 --> 47:20.576
The reason
the distortions got worse,

47:20.620 --> 47:22.578
even though Discovery
held its position?

47:22.622 --> 47:25.712
So this is the anomaly
when we arrived.

47:25.755 --> 47:29.411
And this is it after we left.

47:29.455 --> 47:32.066
It changed direction?

47:32.110 --> 47:34.373
What could have caused that?

47:34.416 --> 47:36.070
That's the thing:

47:36.114 --> 47:38.420
there is nothing in
my understanding of astrophysics

47:38.464 --> 47:40.292
that can explain it.

47:40.335 --> 47:43.251
But... we gathered this data

47:43.295 --> 47:45.775
in order to predict its path.

47:45.819 --> 47:47.777
Are you saying
we cannot do that?

47:48.822 --> 47:50.998
No, sir, we can't.

47:51.042 --> 47:55.046
It could go anywhere,
at any time, and...

47:55.089 --> 47:58.310
we may not have
any kind of warning at all.
