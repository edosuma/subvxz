Male announcer:
Previously on Life...

00:01.837 --> 00:03.138
A cop serving time?

00:03.139 --> 00:06.843
They broke nearly
every bone in his body.

00:07.577 --> 00:09.412
Ted: Charlie saved
my life in there.

00:09.445 --> 00:12.615
And so now I handle
his settlement money.

00:12.648 --> 00:13.659
Male interviewer: You were in
for white collar crime?

00:13.683 --> 00:15.685
Insider trading, yeah.

00:15.718 --> 00:17.353
You been working
the program, Dani?

00:17.387 --> 00:19.489
Yeah.

00:19.522 --> 00:20.666
I've been working the program.

00:20.690 --> 00:22.625
Man: Do you want
to know my name?

00:22.658 --> 00:24.903
If I wanted to know your name,
I would have asked you for it.

00:24.927 --> 00:26.762
Detective,

00:26.796 --> 00:28.864
I have something
you might be interested in--

00:28.898 --> 00:30.900
the Bank of Los Angeles
shoot-out.

00:30.933 --> 00:32.968
Crews:
That was 15 years ago.

00:33.002 --> 00:34.404
You should ask your partner.

00:34.437 --> 00:37.740
What happened to all that money?

00:42.478 --> 00:43.646
Male trainer:
Okay, listen up.

00:43.679 --> 00:45.548
This is the "officer down"
scenario.

00:45.581 --> 00:47.950
Thanks to our so-called
consent decree,

00:47.983 --> 00:49.619
some dirtbags out there
will shoot it out with us

00:49.652 --> 00:51.454
'cause they think
we can't shoot back.

00:51.487 --> 00:52.788
Nobody wants it--

00:52.822 --> 00:54.524
Mr. Detective.

00:54.557 --> 00:55.791
Watching us do our homework?

00:56.075 --> 00:58.678
Skipped a grade.
Gotta re-qualify.

00:58.711 --> 01:00.813
You ain't riding with us,
are ya?

01:00.846 --> 01:02.682
Thought I would.
Do you mind?

01:02.715 --> 01:03.749
Oh, no problem at all.

01:03.783 --> 01:05.084
I ain't riding in back though.

01:05.117 --> 01:06.695
Oh-ho, you're riding
in the back, Juarez.

01:06.719 --> 01:09.021
Come on, Bobby, you know
what the perps leave back there,

01:09.054 --> 01:10.065
all those fluids and stuff.

01:10.089 --> 01:12.992
You're riding
in the back, Juarez.

01:13.025 --> 01:16.061
All right, let's mount up.

01:16.095 --> 01:19.198
[Slow rock music]

01:19.231 --> 01:27.239
♫

01:52.732 --> 01:54.734
All the cool people
headin' west on Wilshire.

01:54.767 --> 01:56.101
That's my stop.

01:58.170 --> 02:00.172
Mine too.

02:02.675 --> 02:03.976
Mint?

02:06.211 --> 02:07.980
Great minds think alike.

02:14.186 --> 02:16.088
My name is Rick,

02:16.121 --> 02:17.389
and I'm an alcoholic.

02:17.422 --> 02:19.725
Dani.

02:19.759 --> 02:22.161
It's good to meet you, Dani.

02:22.194 --> 02:24.730
Good to meet you, Rick.

02:28.367 --> 02:30.703
Juarez: Come on, what's the deal?
Let's go.

02:30.736 --> 02:34.173
This is the "officer down"
scenario, Juarez.

02:34.206 --> 02:36.809
They gotta shoot somebody first.

02:36.842 --> 02:38.744
You remember this?

02:39.228 --> 02:40.595
Yeah, I remember this.

02:40.629 --> 02:42.131
You two maybe
want to get a room?

02:42.164 --> 02:43.765
Do you know
what I remember most?

02:43.798 --> 02:46.635
It smells like piss back here.

02:46.668 --> 02:47.836
And something else.

02:47.869 --> 02:50.572
The boredom? The burritos?

02:50.605 --> 02:51.806
The stories, man.

02:51.840 --> 02:52.874
Your stories.

02:52.907 --> 02:54.109
Hey, Juarez,

02:54.143 --> 02:54.876
Bobby ever tell you

02:54.909 --> 02:57.179
about his pet Turkey?

02:57.212 --> 02:58.313
It drowned in the rain.

02:58.347 --> 03:00.615
That Turkey was...

03:00.615 --> 03:02.683
All:
The World's Dumbest Bird.

03:02.685 --> 03:04.053
Yuk it up, chuckleheads.

03:04.087 --> 03:06.655
That bird
was d-u-m-b, stupid.

03:06.689 --> 03:07.790
Hey, he ever tell you

03:07.823 --> 03:09.725
about the Bank of Los Angeles
shoot-out?

03:09.758 --> 03:11.760
Yeah, only about
a thousand times.

03:11.794 --> 03:12.761
So many cops in the street...

03:12.795 --> 03:14.563
All you could see was blue.

03:14.597 --> 03:15.640
He fired his gun
so many times...

03:15.664 --> 03:17.600
The muzzle glowed red
from the heat.

03:17.633 --> 03:21.537
Both:
Like a hurricane of bullets.

03:21.570 --> 03:23.406
And there he was.

03:23.439 --> 03:26.509
Right in the middle of it.

03:26.542 --> 03:29.612
Streets are full of blood
and bullet casings.

03:29.645 --> 03:33.749
38 minutes in a nonstop,
free-fire zone.

03:33.782 --> 03:34.817
Five dead.

03:34.850 --> 03:37.420
18 million in cash gone missing.

03:37.453 --> 03:39.655
And you were right there
when it happened.

03:42.125 --> 03:45.094
Yeah, I was right there
when it happened.

04:08.817 --> 04:10.753
Woman:
I was doing pretty good.

04:10.786 --> 04:14.857
Then I got to the end
of this rotten day.

04:14.890 --> 04:16.792
And oh, my God,

04:16.825 --> 04:18.594
she wants me to submit
her expense report.

04:18.627 --> 04:20.563
Of course I get a call

04:20.596 --> 04:21.830
from the babysitter that says

04:21.864 --> 04:24.300
she has to go home early,
and where is my husband?

04:24.333 --> 04:27.770
Yeah, he forgot
to charge his cell.

04:27.803 --> 04:29.672
You know how that is, right?

04:29.705 --> 04:30.982
I wasn't sure
I was gonna make it.

04:31.006 --> 04:33.909
So I asked for strength
against that glass of wine.

04:33.942 --> 04:36.279
That this was just
a situation...

04:36.312 --> 04:37.680
But there's a way through it.

04:37.713 --> 04:39.815
I'm seven months sober today.

04:39.848 --> 04:42.685
[Applause]

04:45.488 --> 04:47.223
They're free.

04:47.256 --> 04:48.724
The donuts.

04:48.757 --> 04:50.159
I've seen you here before.

04:50.193 --> 04:51.694
You're always in such a rush.

04:51.727 --> 04:53.162
I'm Lou.

04:53.196 --> 04:54.530
Why don't you stick around?

04:54.563 --> 04:56.365
Yeah, um, thanks.

04:56.399 --> 04:57.833
But I gotta get to work.

04:57.866 --> 04:59.802
I'm Rick.

04:59.835 --> 05:02.205
And I am powerless.

05:02.488 --> 05:04.790
I'm coming up

05:04.823 --> 05:08.193
on a year of sobriety.

05:08.676 --> 05:10.078
And I'm here

05:10.112 --> 05:12.280
to humbly ask you

05:12.314 --> 05:14.349
to help me.

05:14.382 --> 05:16.952
It's not the first time
I've made 12 months.

05:16.985 --> 05:19.521
I'm not a good guy

05:19.554 --> 05:21.589
when I drink.

05:24.192 --> 05:26.194
I've hurt people.

05:28.596 --> 05:31.399
Women.

05:31.433 --> 05:32.935
About a year ago this month,

05:32.968 --> 05:34.937
there was this, uh,

05:34.970 --> 05:37.605
one girl.

05:37.639 --> 05:39.341
If I had been sober...

05:42.044 --> 05:45.147
It got, uh, intense.

05:45.180 --> 05:47.682
She coulda made
a lot of trouble.

05:47.715 --> 05:49.184
A lot.

05:49.217 --> 05:53.221
She took back
what she, uh--

05:53.255 --> 05:55.223
I guess she realized

05:55.257 --> 05:57.359
she shouldn't have pushed me.

05:57.392 --> 06:00.128
I'm telling you this
because you,

06:00.162 --> 06:02.931
all of you here,

06:02.965 --> 06:04.933
are my strength.

06:13.075 --> 06:14.576
[Talking indistinctly]

06:14.609 --> 06:16.044
I gotta say hi
to a friend of mine.

06:16.078 --> 06:18.146
[Softly]
See you next week.

06:18.180 --> 06:19.614
Hey.

06:19.647 --> 06:21.116
You waited.

06:21.149 --> 06:22.584
Great.

06:22.617 --> 06:24.386
Wanna pick up where we left off?

06:24.419 --> 06:26.288
Get to know each other?

06:26.321 --> 06:29.191
You told quite a story in there.

06:29.224 --> 06:31.026
And you didn't say a word.

06:31.059 --> 06:32.527
What's with begging those people

06:32.560 --> 06:34.029
to help you stay sober?

06:34.062 --> 06:35.363
Oh, boy.

06:35.847 --> 06:38.149
Listen,

06:38.182 --> 06:40.618
I slipped.

06:40.652 --> 06:42.887
And I needed to say so in there.

06:42.920 --> 06:46.123
Is that so awful?

06:46.157 --> 06:48.660
That stuff about hurting women.

06:50.895 --> 06:53.498
That's over.

06:55.967 --> 06:57.869
What happened exactly?

06:57.902 --> 07:00.037
Do you ever, uh,

07:00.071 --> 07:03.641
have so much shame
about something

07:03.675 --> 07:06.978
that you can't even
choke it out?

07:08.212 --> 07:10.882
Dani, I know
you understand this.

07:12.717 --> 07:14.852
Give me a chance.

07:17.789 --> 07:20.792
Maybe another time.

07:20.825 --> 07:22.760
Can I call you?

07:25.563 --> 07:27.965
Tell me your last name at least.

07:27.999 --> 07:30.835
I'm a friend of Bill.

07:34.856 --> 07:36.323
Hey, how was your meeting?

07:36.607 --> 07:38.242
Required by my employer.

07:38.275 --> 07:40.187
Every moment you spend
wishing you were someplace else

07:40.211 --> 07:43.214
is a moment you can't get back.

07:43.247 --> 07:44.324
What about every moment I spend

07:44.348 --> 07:47.084
wishing you were someplace else?

07:47.118 --> 07:49.220
It would hurt my feelings
if I thought you meant it.

07:49.253 --> 07:51.388
Besides,

07:51.422 --> 07:53.490
those meetings do a lot of good.

07:53.524 --> 07:54.758
I've seen guys get sober

07:54.791 --> 07:57.094
who were as self-aware
as this piece of fruit.

07:57.128 --> 08:00.364
Although it's not entirely clear
how aware fruit is.

08:00.397 --> 08:04.201
You know plants
recognize their relatives?

08:04.235 --> 08:05.769
Everything okay there?

08:05.802 --> 08:09.306
I heard something.

08:09.340 --> 08:11.208
I heard a guy confess to a rape.

08:11.242 --> 08:12.176
I mean,

08:12.209 --> 08:14.445
he acted like he wanted help
staying sober,

08:14.478 --> 08:17.481
but he was drinking
right before the meeting.

08:17.514 --> 08:19.316
You saw him drinking?

08:19.350 --> 08:21.018
Which means you were in a place

08:21.052 --> 08:22.453
where there was drinking.

08:22.486 --> 08:23.687
Like a bar?

08:23.720 --> 08:26.057
Focus on the words
I'm actually saying, okay?

08:26.090 --> 08:27.791
This guy gets up and says

08:27.824 --> 08:29.326
he was hurtful to a woman

08:29.360 --> 08:30.603
the last time
he went out on a binge.

08:30.627 --> 08:32.129
That was a year ago.

08:32.163 --> 08:33.397
And he's drinking again.

08:33.430 --> 08:34.641
"Hurtful" can mean
a lot of things.

08:34.665 --> 08:36.300
Yeah, but it means this thing.

08:36.333 --> 08:38.302
He blamed the victim
for making him do it.

08:38.335 --> 08:39.603
He said that he could get

08:39.636 --> 08:41.305
into a lot of trouble for it.

08:41.338 --> 08:43.574
And he stopped talking
when he got too close

08:43.607 --> 08:45.276
to saying what happened.

08:45.309 --> 08:47.378
And he has a record.

08:47.411 --> 08:48.812
I ran his plates.

08:48.845 --> 08:51.648
Richard Larson.

08:51.682 --> 08:54.318
Misdemeanor sexual assault
conviction in 2002.

08:54.351 --> 08:56.153
I bet it was a plea bargain.

08:56.187 --> 08:57.230
You can't push a misdemeanor
to a felony

08:57.254 --> 08:59.190
just because you don't like
what somebody said.

08:59.223 --> 09:00.357
It's not about what I like.

09:00.391 --> 09:02.326
It's like
circumstantial evidence.

09:02.359 --> 09:04.228
Is that what you think?

09:09.233 --> 09:11.268
Davis:
I'd like to welcome
members of the press

09:11.302 --> 09:13.470
to our fifth annual open house.

09:13.504 --> 09:15.339
It is an honor
to have you all here.

09:15.372 --> 09:16.740
We have great progress

09:16.773 --> 09:19.243
to report on community policing.

09:19.276 --> 09:21.412
Compstat, our computer
statistics program,

09:21.445 --> 09:23.514
has reduced crime city wide

09:23.547 --> 09:24.781
by 15% this year.

09:24.815 --> 09:25.649
If you look here--

09:25.682 --> 09:28.485
yeah, yeah, fine.
Great.

09:28.519 --> 09:29.620
I know that number.

09:29.653 --> 09:32.189
Why aren't you people
out on the street?

09:32.223 --> 09:34.191
Numbers don't stop crime.

09:34.225 --> 09:36.593
Davis:
What news organization
do you represent?

09:36.627 --> 09:38.529
The People's News.
I'm the Stickler.

09:38.562 --> 09:41.198
And this is tonight's webcast
from the Stickler.

09:41.232 --> 09:42.533
Online now...

09:42.566 --> 09:44.335
LAPD shills try again

09:44.368 --> 09:45.812
to trick us
with half-truths and lies.

09:45.836 --> 09:47.271
Lies, ma'am?

09:47.304 --> 09:49.273
Can we discuss this
after the meeting?

09:49.306 --> 09:50.674
Get her on camera, bud.

09:50.707 --> 09:51.742
Action.

09:51.775 --> 09:53.377
We'll need
to discuss this later.

09:53.410 --> 09:55.146
She's not kidding.

09:55.179 --> 09:56.147
Cut.

09:56.180 --> 09:57.614
No, not "cut."
Action.

09:57.648 --> 09:58.782
Action.

09:58.815 --> 10:00.251
Somebody is trying

10:00.284 --> 10:02.219
to drive me out of my home.

10:02.253 --> 10:03.487
There a guy who takes a dump

10:03.520 --> 10:05.489
on my lawn.

10:05.522 --> 10:06.557
A couple of times a week

10:06.590 --> 10:08.625
for the past three months.

10:08.659 --> 10:10.261
He's after me.

10:10.294 --> 10:12.229
I will contact animal control.

10:12.263 --> 10:13.830
This is no dog.

10:13.864 --> 10:15.499
How do you know?

10:15.532 --> 10:17.234
Dogs don't eat corn!

10:17.268 --> 10:18.411
We have a task force
that's set up

10:18.435 --> 10:20.204
for just this sort of problem.

10:20.237 --> 10:22.149
- Nobody believes in results

If you saw a crime
about to happen,

10:49.466 --> 10:50.667
what would you do?

10:50.701 --> 10:52.869
But you said
it already happened.

Well, it's
about to happen again.

in A.A.,

10:56.673 --> 10:59.576
I'm gonna stop him.

How come
you're at A.A.?

11:00.777 --> 11:02.379
It was drugs, not alcohol.

11:02.413 --> 11:03.614

ditch her computer,

21:12.321 --> 21:14.523
Do I want to tell stories?

21:14.556 --> 21:16.458
Yeah, it's a stakeout.
We can't eat junk food.

21:16.491 --> 21:18.994
At least let's swap stories.

I'll go first.
Okay.

21:23.398 --> 21:25.034
Okay, so--

21:25.067 --> 21:26.435
okay, stakeout stories,

21:26.468 --> 21:29.304
usually--usually
revolve around women.

21:29.338 --> 21:30.305
Okay?

21:30.339 --> 21:32.107
Okay, who you would,

21:32.141 --> 21:33.976
you know, if you could.

You know, or cars?

21:35.410 --> 21:36.378
Or sports?

21:36.411 --> 21:38.380
Like, how 'bout those Dodgers?

21:38.413 --> 21:40.983
Is this what you
and Detective Reese talk about?

21:41.016 --> 21:43.285
No, no, mostly we just
talk about

21:43.318 --> 21:45.587
how lucky we are
to have you as a boss.

[Snickers]

21:48.057 --> 21:51.493
You know,
back when I was a rookie,

21:51.526 --> 21:53.128
all we ever used to talk about,

21:53.162 --> 21:54.363
stuck in that car,

21:54.396 --> 21:56.231
was the Bank of L.A.
shoot-out.

21:56.515 --> 21:58.617
That was all anybody
talked about in those days.

21:58.650 --> 22:00.485
Five perps dead.

22:00.519 --> 22:02.354
Not one cop shot.

22:02.387 --> 22:04.756

22:09.128 --> 22:10.529
You know?
I don't know.

22:10.562 --> 22:12.764
I guess
I just like conspiracies.

22:12.797 --> 22:14.342
Conspiracies, detective,
are how bored people

22:14.366 --> 22:15.234
pass the time.

22:15.517 --> 22:17.352
But come on,
if there was no sixth man,

22:17.386 --> 22:18.753
then who took all the money?

22:18.787 --> 22:20.064
There was obviously someone
who got away with the cash.

22:20.088 --> 22:22.391
Where's the conspiracy in that?

22:22.424 --> 22:24.893
Whose side were they on,
ours or theirs?

22:24.926 --> 22:26.695
Like I said,

22:26.728 --> 22:30.532
conspiracies are how
bored people pass the time.

22:30.565 --> 22:32.033
I never got Halloween,

22:32.066 --> 22:35.036
dressing up
and begging for candy.

22:38.673 --> 22:40.875
I think it's supposed to be fun.

22:40.909 --> 22:42.377
But why beg for candy

22:42.411 --> 22:45.514
when you can just go out
and buy what you want?

22:45.547 --> 22:48.417

24:15.769 --> 24:17.238
What'd you think you were doing?

24:17.271 --> 24:18.282
I can't live until he dies.
You told me that.

24:18.806 --> 24:19.949
You said I would stay in prison
until he was dead.

24:19.973 --> 24:21.675
Yeah, but he didn't mean
you were supposed

24:21.709 --> 24:22.676
to kill the guy yourself.

24:22.710 --> 24:23.677
That's not what you meant.

what you meant.

The way he talks,

24:30.017 --> 24:32.185
he knows things about people.

24:32.219 --> 24:33.787
He said he was just like me.

24:33.821 --> 24:35.489
That he used to drink.

24:35.523 --> 24:37.591
And he could tell that
I was drinking a lot too.

24:37.625 --> 24:38.902
He swore he'd kill me if I told,

24:38.926 --> 24:40.728

You didn't die.

what happened to you.

you would have
the strength to survive

That's your secret, Nancy.

how strong he made you.

he wasn't holding his breath.

When Larson went
on that bender last year,

he went AWOL for a month.

all that on the phone?

26:18.439 --> 26:20.574
Well, I asked.

Rick Larson about a rape.

I think you're wrong about Rick.

He's a great person
to talk to, isn't he?

27:28.659 --> 27:30.794
I didn't know
what would happen to me here,

27:30.828 --> 27:32.396
and he could feel that.

27:32.430 --> 27:33.931
Without me even saying, he knew.

It's kind of getting to be
about more than A.A.

that you were looking for him.

to go where there's a bar.

27:56.320 --> 27:57.455
is such good stakeout talk

27:57.488 --> 27:59.390
is there were so many
cops on scene,

27:59.423 --> 28:01.392
there are so many
different stories.

28:01.425 --> 28:02.860

any different versions.

to be there so badly

in front of the bank that day

28:30.921 --> 28:32.323
at all.

28:32.356 --> 28:33.724

28:33.757 --> 28:36.327
Over 1,100 rounds fired,
but they were all tactical.

28:36.360 --> 28:37.728
Tactical?

28:37.761 --> 28:40.898
SWAT was on a training exercise
one block over.

28:40.931 --> 28:42.266
They were there first.

28:42.300 --> 28:43.643
That's why
no civilians were killed.

28:43.667 --> 28:44.968
That's why no police were shot.
