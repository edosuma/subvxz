03:57.402 --> 03:59.335
Hi.

03:59.337 --> 04:01.471
Look, I don't know
what you want me to say.

04:01.473 --> 04:02.739
Could start
with "thank you".

04:02.741 --> 04:05.409
Thanks... for
picking me up.

04:05.411 --> 04:07.580
"Sorry" would
be nice.

04:20.992 --> 04:22.591
You're smoking again.

04:22.593 --> 04:25.027
Yeah, I'm
smoking again.

04:25.029 --> 04:27.666
Not around
him, Max.

04:37.642 --> 04:39.343
You look good.

04:39.345 --> 04:42.111
I'm eating good,
I'm not drinking,

04:42.113 --> 04:46.382
I'm not smoking...
nothing.

04:46.384 --> 04:48.784
Please tell me you
learned your lesson.

04:48.786 --> 04:50.486
I learned
lots of lessons.

04:50.488 --> 04:52.555
I learned how
to make a shiv.

04:52.557 --> 04:54.791
Turns out prison has
arts & crafts time.

04:54.793 --> 04:56.829
It's not funny.

05:03.802 --> 05:05.702
How is he?

05:05.704 --> 05:11.108
He's good. Yeah.
He's good.

05:11.110 --> 05:13.810
That's good. Thanks
for not bringing him.

05:13.812 --> 05:15.478
Well, he's
got school.

05:15.480 --> 05:16.579
He's in school?

05:16.581 --> 05:17.947
Mm hm,
preschool.

05:17.949 --> 05:19.649
Preschool?

05:19.651 --> 05:21.687
Yep, he says
he's a big kid now.

05:27.692 --> 05:29.659
What, so this is
what you listen to now?

05:29.661 --> 05:31.527
Yeah, it's
only been a year.

05:31.529 --> 05:33.462
A year, a month,
and nine days.

05:33.464 --> 05:34.930
But who's counting?

05:34.932 --> 05:36.966
Yeah, and not much has
changed since then,

05:36.968 --> 05:38.468
it's just music.

05:40.105 --> 05:43.539
Really? Did they
come play for you

05:43.541 --> 05:45.574
during your
stint in Folsom?

06:25.184 --> 06:26.419
Oh!

06:45.137 --> 06:46.902
Max?

06:46.904 --> 06:48.204
Max, look at me.

06:48.206 --> 06:50.240
Look at
me, Max.

06:50.242 --> 06:51.477
Max...

07:02.653 --> 07:04.053
Sorry.

07:04.055 --> 07:06.789
It's fine.

07:06.791 --> 07:11.194
No, it wasn't.
It sucked.

07:11.196 --> 07:13.433
It was fine.

08:08.987 --> 08:12.255
Do you want
anything?

08:16.261 --> 08:17.497
Okay.

08:34.779 --> 08:36.278
This is a
missing person.

08:36.280 --> 08:37.780
Have you
seen him?

08:37.783 --> 08:39.582
Bigfoot
got 'im!

08:39.585 --> 08:41.116
He's coming
'round again.

08:41.119 --> 08:42.318
Yeah, right.

08:42.321 --> 08:45.220
Hairy, ape-man
bastard.

08:45.222 --> 08:47.656
You and your kind
ain't foolin' me

08:47.658 --> 08:50.660
with your wampum,
your Oh-Mah,

08:50.662 --> 08:53.162
and your mystic
injun horseshit!

08:53.164 --> 08:57.166
Nickel Pete, if you see
him you give me a call.

08:57.168 --> 08:58.634
Yeah, I'll
do that.

08:58.636 --> 08:59.938
Thank you.

09:01.907 --> 09:03.607
You're all
in on it...

09:03.609 --> 09:05.675
Try the
fuckin' donuts.

09:05.677 --> 09:07.113
Bigfoot lovers.

09:14.318 --> 09:16.151
Hey...

09:16.153 --> 09:18.021
big, hairy bastard.

09:18.023 --> 09:18.854
Sorry?

09:18.856 --> 09:20.857
Giant, hairy,
mohawk motherfucker

09:20.859 --> 09:22.324
coming
'round again...

09:22.326 --> 09:24.294
him and his big
ol' fuckin' feet.

09:24.296 --> 09:26.095
Gonna getcha!
Ha ha ha!

09:26.097 --> 09:28.233
Yeah, sure as shit.
Twenty dollars.

09:34.339 --> 09:35.975
Have a nice day.

09:46.951 --> 09:48.987
That's what I'm
talking 'bout.

09:51.255 --> 09:55.090
Hey! Put it in your
pants, ya pervert!

09:55.092 --> 09:56.425
Hey!

09:56.427 --> 09:58.798
Okay,
alright. Ow!

10:00.131 --> 10:02.065
Well, well...

10:02.067 --> 10:03.867
Boo!!

10:05.336 --> 10:06.869
Convict.

10:06.871 --> 10:08.405
Ex-convict.

10:08.407 --> 10:11.907
Woo hoo hoo! I'm
shakin' in my boots!

10:14.745 --> 10:16.182
Are you done?

10:35.167 --> 10:38.204
Got you some, uh,
healthy trail mix.

10:42.774 --> 10:45.874
Really? You've been
out an hour and you

10:45.876 --> 10:48.011
already got me on
an open container.

10:48.013 --> 10:49.845
Ashley, it's
just a beer.

10:49.847 --> 10:51.381
No! It's a Class
2 misdemeanor

10:51.383 --> 10:53.416
'cause I already
got one, remember?

10:53.418 --> 10:57.219
I guess you didn't
learn a goddamn thing.

10:57.221 --> 10:58.887
I learned
plenty, actually.

10:58.889 --> 11:00.790
I learned that
when making a shiv

11:00.792 --> 11:03.193
you've gotta taper and
serrate the blade...

11:03.195 --> 11:05.494
otherwise you're
just poppin' people

11:05.496 --> 11:07.397
with needles and
that's just something

11:07.399 --> 11:09.331
they're used to. But
when the time is right,

11:09.333 --> 11:11.200
the only thing that
you have to do is

11:11.202 --> 11:13.302
aim for the sweet spot,
just right in the kidney.

11:13.304 --> 11:14.270
Enough!

11:14.272 --> 11:15.905
Then <i>you</i>
say something.

11:15.907 --> 11:18.074
You say something to
make all this good again.

11:18.076 --> 11:21.411
Because you didn't
say a goddamn thing

11:21.413 --> 11:23.448
when I was sitting
in handcuffs...

11:25.317 --> 11:26.449
You know...

11:26.451 --> 11:28.984
you weren't much
better than me, Ashley.

11:28.986 --> 11:31.488
Not much, but at
least I was better.

11:31.490 --> 11:33.323
And I'm clean
now, courtesy

11:33.325 --> 11:35.291
of the Department
of Corrections.

11:35.293 --> 11:36.124
Congratulations!

11:36.126 --> 11:37.893
I'm glad they
could do it for you

11:37.895 --> 11:40.063
but your wife and son
weren't worth enough.

11:40.065 --> 11:42.968
For a year, a
month, and nine days

11:43.999 --> 11:45.768
I have been planning
this exact moment.

11:45.770 --> 11:47.503
I'm just
fucking it up.

11:47.505 --> 11:49.973
How could you fuck
this up? It's me.

11:49.975 --> 11:52.776
This is me.
This is us.

11:52.778 --> 11:56.845
What? What?
Say it.

11:56.847 --> 11:58.080
I'm scared.

11:58.082 --> 12:01.184
Right now in
this moment...

12:01.186 --> 12:03.853
I'm scared.

12:03.855 --> 12:05.821
You're scared?

12:05.823 --> 12:08.126
I'm scared
shitless.

12:10.028 --> 12:11.330
Good answer.

12:18.470 --> 12:21.507
Shit! What
was that?

13:09.888 --> 13:11.286
Oh, my God.

13:11.288 --> 13:13.488
He's not moving.

13:13.490 --> 13:15.324
What happened
to him?

13:15.326 --> 13:18.094
Where did he come from?
What was he doing?

13:18.096 --> 13:20.095
I don't know.

13:20.097 --> 13:22.098
But our car
didn't do all that.

13:23.268 --> 13:24.467
Oh, my God!

13:31.475 --> 13:33.979
I'm going to
get my phone.

13:38.182 --> 13:39.415
Ashley!

13:39.417 --> 13:42.384
Ashley... Ashley!

13:42.386 --> 13:45.354
Ashley, wait. There's
beer all over the car.

13:45.356 --> 13:46.323
We just hit
this guy.

13:46.325 --> 13:48.324
Yeah, there's no way
we did all that, Max.

13:48.326 --> 13:49.959
That was
not just us.

13:49.961 --> 13:51.094
Jesus, Ash!

13:51.096 --> 13:52.661
Just got out.
Party of one?

13:52.663 --> 13:55.598
Don't do this to me.
Think about us.

13:55.600 --> 13:58.667
Ashley, please.

14:01.907 --> 14:04.907
Yeah, hello?
I'm on Hwy 23

14:04.909 --> 14:07.209
about 25 miles
north of state prison.

14:07.211 --> 14:09.344
There's been
an accident.

14:09.346 --> 14:13.215
Yes, there's a man
here and he needs help.

14:13.217 --> 14:16.151
Yes, as soon as
possible, please.

14:16.153 --> 14:17.085
Yes.

14:17.087 --> 14:18.353
Max!

14:20.557 --> 14:21.593
Ow!

14:23.327 --> 14:24.963
Oh, my God!

14:26.398 --> 14:27.629
Ugh!

15:00.065 --> 15:03.632
Max!

15:03.634 --> 15:05.300
Wake up!

15:29.259 --> 15:30.560
Max!

15:30.562 --> 15:32.228
Wake up!

15:47.711 --> 15:48.947
Max!

16:28.653 --> 16:30.219
Max!

16:33.291 --> 16:34.326
Max!

17:09.394 --> 17:11.126
Max! Max?

17:11.127 --> 17:13.095
Max, wake up!

17:13.097 --> 17:15.198
Wake up, Max.

17:15.200 --> 17:16.798
Wake up!

17:18.702 --> 17:20.536
Max! Max...

17:22.673 --> 17:24.106
Wake up!

17:24.108 --> 17:25.440
Max!

17:25.442 --> 17:30.546
Wake up, Max!

17:47.731 --> 17:49.768
Come on, okay.

18:00.545 --> 18:02.581
Come on,
almost there.

18:11.890 --> 18:13.922
What happened?

18:13.924 --> 18:16.691
You fucking
fell in the water.

18:18.395 --> 18:20.328
You're going into
shock, come here.

18:20.330 --> 18:21.730
No, I'm
just cold.

18:21.732 --> 18:23.332
Come on,
sit up.

18:23.334 --> 18:26.371
Come here. I'll
get you warm.

18:32.710 --> 18:34.610
We need to
get you warm.

18:34.612 --> 18:36.648
Come on,
sit up.

18:38.750 --> 18:40.650
Stand up.

19:16.820 --> 19:17.753
Sheriff!

19:17.755 --> 19:18.921
Mrs. Goring.

19:18.923 --> 19:20.422
You find him?

19:20.424 --> 19:22.257
I'm sorry,
not yet.

19:22.259 --> 19:23.859
What are you
gonna do about it?

19:23.861 --> 19:25.527
We're still doing
everything we can

19:25.529 --> 19:26.796
within our means.

19:26.798 --> 19:27.764
Bullshit!

19:27.766 --> 19:30.999
I want answers now,
or I'll have your job!

19:31.001 --> 19:31.901
Please...

19:31.903 --> 19:35.805
Mrs. Goring, we will
find your husband.

19:35.807 --> 19:37.506
I promise you.

19:37.508 --> 19:38.940
You know
something!

19:38.942 --> 19:42.181
You know something
you're not telling us!

19:50.421 --> 19:52.255
I see Mrs.
G sniped ya.

19:52.257 --> 19:53.421
Any luck?

19:53.423 --> 19:54.690
No.

19:54.692 --> 19:56.792
Say, are you
part of this vast

19:56.794 --> 19:59.828
Indian-Bigfoot
conspiracy?

19:59.830 --> 20:00.830
Nope.

20:00.832 --> 20:04.967
Nickel Pete says I
should know all about it.

20:04.969 --> 20:07.902
Thought I was
missing out on something.

20:07.904 --> 20:09.904
Nickel Pete
might be right.

20:09.906 --> 20:12.775
Maybe there's something
to those Oh-Mah stories.

20:12.777 --> 20:15.378
You're taking sides
with Nickel Pete?

20:15.380 --> 20:18.546
If it means honoring the
traditions, I guess so.

20:18.548 --> 20:21.049
So you're saying you
would call on Nickel Pete

20:21.051 --> 20:23.286
as an expert
reliable witness?

20:23.288 --> 20:24.819
Uh, no.

20:24.821 --> 20:27.289
Then what the
hell are you saying?

20:27.291 --> 20:29.959
I'm saying we shouldn't
ignore the Oh-Mah legends

20:29.961 --> 20:31.893
Nickel Pete or
no Nickel Pete.

20:34.332 --> 20:35.864
Sheriff?

20:35.866 --> 20:38.467
I think you're
smoking something

20:38.469 --> 20:40.568
other than tobacco
in that peace pipe

20:40.570 --> 20:42.438
bong of
yours, Deputy.

20:42.440 --> 20:43.972
What's this, Nell?

20:43.974 --> 20:46.007
911 call, no
name or nothing.

20:46.009 --> 20:48.710
Aw, Hell's monkeys, I
was just out this way.

20:48.712 --> 20:50.313
Call if you
need backup.

20:50.315 --> 20:51.546
Yeah, I will.

20:51.548 --> 20:53.349
I'll use the radio.
Because smoke signals

20:53.351 --> 20:55.351
don't work so
well in the rain.

20:56.988 --> 20:58.853
Don't fall and
break your hip.

20:58.855 --> 21:01.626
You're lucky I
let you wear a gun.

21:11.368 --> 21:12.403
Okay.

21:15.506 --> 21:18.039
Your lighter... I
need your lighter.

21:18.041 --> 21:19.810
Come on,
come on.

21:34.392 --> 21:36.691
Come on... please.

21:46.636 --> 21:48.036
Please... light.

21:48.038 --> 21:49.674
Oh, my God.

22:06.891 --> 22:09.928
Come on,
fire... yes.

22:22.440 --> 22:24.105
Here we go.

22:24.107 --> 22:25.344
Okay.

22:32.115 --> 22:34.353
Okay, we're
almost there.

22:36.453 --> 22:39.490
Okay...

22:53.971 --> 22:56.838
There was an easier way
to get my clothes off.

22:58.209 --> 23:00.112
Not with you.

23:04.882 --> 23:06.015
I'm sorry.

23:06.017 --> 23:08.049
It's okay.

23:08.051 --> 23:10.087
I'm so sorry.

23:25.836 --> 23:27.873
What have
we got here?

24:17.087 --> 24:20.122
Nellibell, I'm at the
location of the 911 call

24:20.124 --> 24:23.124
about a hundred yards
north of Marker 23

24:23.126 --> 24:25.294
on the highway.
You call Nelson,

24:25.296 --> 24:27.563
you tell him to get
over here with a winch

24:27.565 --> 24:30.099
and about a hundred
feet of cable ASAP.

24:30.101 --> 24:31.600
Lickety-split.

24:38.075 --> 24:40.543
Max: In the morning
we'll set things right,

24:40.545 --> 24:42.844
okay? I'll get you
back to Jameson.

24:42.846 --> 24:44.846
Where is Jameson?

24:44.848 --> 24:46.715
He's at mom's.

24:46.717 --> 24:48.551
Poor guy.

24:48.553 --> 24:49.584
Stop.

24:49.586 --> 24:50.853
It's worse
than prison.

24:50.855 --> 24:52.054
No.

24:52.056 --> 24:54.222
I didn't know what
was going to happen.

24:54.224 --> 24:56.592
I thought we'd either
be yelling at each other

24:56.594 --> 24:58.126
all night or we'd
be shacked up

24:58.128 --> 25:00.228
in a hotel
room somewhere.

25:01.999 --> 25:04.099
Whatever it was,
it wasn't this.

25:04.101 --> 25:05.968
I mean, what's
our next move?

25:05.970 --> 25:07.702
What are we
gonna do?

25:07.704 --> 25:09.805
You got me here
to protect you...

25:09.807 --> 25:12.740
defensive prison
techniques and all.

25:12.742 --> 25:14.709
So, this shiv
business...

25:14.711 --> 25:16.812
It's a
legitimate thing.

25:16.814 --> 25:18.713
Who told
you that?

25:18.715 --> 25:20.015
My cellmate.

25:20.017 --> 25:24.987
Legend has it he shanked
about a dozen guys

25:24.989 --> 25:26.755
back in the day.

25:26.757 --> 25:29.024
Please tell me you
didn't shank anyone.

25:29.026 --> 25:31.826
No, I couldn't
hurt anybody else.

25:31.828 --> 25:35.197
Not after all
that's happened.

25:35.199 --> 25:37.833
It was an
accident, Max.

25:37.835 --> 25:42.770
No... no,
it wasn't.

25:42.772 --> 25:46.609
But we'll get
you back, okay?

25:46.611 --> 25:50.912
We'll get us back to
Jameson and then we'll,

25:50.914 --> 25:53.349
uh... we'll make sure
everything's alright,

25:53.351 --> 25:55.587
okay? I promise.

26:01.625 --> 26:03.662
Hey... look at me.

26:09.200 --> 26:11.702
You gotta trust
me, okay?

26:15.673 --> 26:17.709
I trust you.

26:35.692 --> 26:37.729
Let's get this
on the road.

26:49.906 --> 26:52.306
Ashley Carr.

26:52.308 --> 26:55.079
Ashley Carr...

26:58.982 --> 27:02.785
This guy... check with
the prison, find out if

27:02.787 --> 27:06.321
they had any inmates
released today.

28:31.008 --> 28:33.542
Max! Where
are you?

28:33.544 --> 28:37.345
Ashley!
What's wrong?

28:37.347 --> 28:39.148
Where are
my clothes?

28:39.150 --> 28:41.150
Aren't they
where you left them?

28:41.152 --> 28:43.451
I left them right here,
I didn't touch them.

28:43.453 --> 28:45.520
Well, they have to
be here somewhere.

28:45.522 --> 28:47.221
What is this?

28:47.223 --> 28:48.957
Well, there
are your shoes.

28:48.959 --> 28:50.862
What the fuck?!

28:52.563 --> 28:55.463
Take this. Here.

28:55.465 --> 28:57.099
That's it?

28:57.101 --> 28:59.738
I mean, unless you
want my pants, too.

29:03.106 --> 29:04.206
Works for me.

29:04.208 --> 29:05.940
Good, I'm glad it
works for someone.

29:05.942 --> 29:08.376
- Alright, let's go.
- Hold on.

29:08.378 --> 29:09.413
Ugh.

29:29.333 --> 29:31.165
Ashley: How
are you feeling?

29:31.167 --> 29:33.168
Max: Really
good. I mean,

29:33.170 --> 29:36.037
my head fuckin' hurts
but the view ain't bad.

29:36.039 --> 29:38.076
Well, let's
get home.

29:40.411 --> 29:42.244
Come on.
This'll be easy.

29:42.246 --> 29:45.613
We'll just follow
the river back up

29:45.615 --> 29:48.283
to the road, flag
someone down...

29:48.285 --> 29:50.922
It'll be easy.

29:59.430 --> 30:01.932
Shit's Creek,
I presume?

30:58.955 --> 31:01.023
Ashley: My
shoes are wet.

31:01.025 --> 31:03.491
My feet feel like cold
prunes. It sucks!

31:03.493 --> 31:06.161
Max: Well, I've
got wet jeans

31:06.163 --> 31:08.196
and sand in
my crotch...

31:08.198 --> 31:10.599
so it's
chafing my nuts.

31:10.601 --> 31:12.637
You win.

31:33.123 --> 31:34.523
Shh. Do you
hear that?

31:34.525 --> 31:35.524
Yeah.

31:39.596 --> 31:41.296
You know
who that is?

31:41.298 --> 31:43.097
Yeah.

31:43.099 --> 31:45.700
Yeah, it's our inbred
hunting buddies

31:45.702 --> 31:47.469
from back at
the gas station.

31:47.471 --> 31:49.270
Unfortunately they're
the only ones that

31:49.272 --> 31:51.472
might have a cell
phone or a radio.

31:51.474 --> 31:54.008
Come on, we
don't have a choice.

31:54.010 --> 31:55.142
Great.

31:55.144 --> 31:56.446
Come on.

31:59.615 --> 32:02.284
Maxwell Carr... just
released yesterday.

32:02.286 --> 32:04.286
What was
he in for?

32:04.288 --> 32:05.554
Reckless
endangerment,

32:05.556 --> 32:07.221
assault with a
deadly weapon.

32:07.223 --> 32:08.690
His car
hit a kid.

32:08.692 --> 32:10.392
Possession,
substance abuse,

32:10.394 --> 32:12.697
same old stupid
fucking white man.

32:14.298 --> 32:16.131
So... the wife
picks him up,

32:16.133 --> 32:18.702
they crash the
car, and vanish.

32:22.205 --> 32:25.440
So you're telling
me right here

32:25.442 --> 32:27.508
right now to my face
that you actually

32:27.510 --> 32:30.144
believe there's an
Oh-Mah out there?

32:30.146 --> 32:32.381
Motherfucking
Bigfoot himself!

32:32.383 --> 32:35.316
Abducting white people...
ex-cons no less.

32:35.318 --> 32:37.753
No, but I like it better
than being told it's wrong.

32:37.755 --> 32:39.755
I like it better than
being told it's not true.

32:39.757 --> 32:42.190
I like it better than
being told what to think.

32:42.192 --> 32:44.292
- It's an identity.
- Protest.

32:44.294 --> 32:46.394
- Same thing.
- Not even close.

32:46.396 --> 32:48.029
You tell me right
here, right now

32:48.031 --> 32:50.132
you 100% don't
believe it's Oh-Mah.

32:50.134 --> 32:52.566
Aha! See that?

32:52.568 --> 32:55.670
I don't believe it's
Oh-Mah. Swear to God!

32:55.672 --> 32:57.139
Sure thing,
Sheriff.

32:57.141 --> 32:58.672
You should go ask
the Whispering Woman.

32:58.674 --> 33:00.074
She might know
what happened.

33:00.076 --> 33:01.575
That's her turf.

33:01.577 --> 33:03.277
With all due
respect, Deputy,

33:03.279 --> 33:05.413
to the ancestors...
fuck that.

33:05.415 --> 33:08.350
You're afraid
of her.

33:08.352 --> 33:10.218
What?

33:10.220 --> 33:12.487
Okay, some.

33:12.489 --> 33:14.055
Is she even
still alive?

33:14.057 --> 33:15.457
She'll always
be alive.

33:15.459 --> 33:17.459
She's not human.

33:17.461 --> 33:20.228
Please tell me you don't
really believe that.

33:20.230 --> 33:21.496
No, not really.

33:21.498 --> 33:23.265
You should go
talk to her.

33:23.267 --> 33:25.267
What she knows
will die with her.

33:25.269 --> 33:27.501
Listen to her
before it's too late.

33:27.503 --> 33:29.270
Yeah, listening
to answers

33:29.272 --> 33:30.604
you don't
believe in.

33:30.606 --> 33:32.507
At least not in
this day and age.

33:32.509 --> 33:34.109
Probably not.

33:34.111 --> 33:35.643
I really wish I
could believe...

33:35.645 --> 33:37.645
I really do.

33:37.647 --> 33:39.314
Ironic, huh?

33:39.316 --> 33:40.751
I'd say tragic.

34:03.373 --> 34:05.574
You should probably
sit this one out.

34:05.576 --> 34:07.077
Ya think?

34:23.559 --> 34:24.824
Hey...

34:24.827 --> 34:27.496
whoa ho ho ho!

34:27.498 --> 34:30.398
Hey, hey, where's
the funky bunch, man?

34:30.400 --> 34:32.501
The funky...

34:32.503 --> 34:37.204
Well, well, well. If
it ain't the convict!

34:37.206 --> 34:40.842
Oh, I apologize...
ex-convict.

34:40.844 --> 34:42.878
Look, guys, there was
an accident on the road.

34:42.880 --> 34:44.713
Does anybody
have a cell phone?

34:44.715 --> 34:48.315
Cell phone?
Cell phone?

34:48.318 --> 34:51.820
Think I-think
I lost mine.

34:51.822 --> 34:54.922
Well, sorry
about that.

34:54.925 --> 34:57.191
I mean, hell, it ain't
like we get a lot of

34:57.193 --> 34:59.494
service out in these
parts. I mean, really,

34:59.496 --> 35:01.862
what's a moose gonna
do with a cell phone?

35:03.534 --> 35:05.700
Moose... moose
with a cell phone...

35:05.702 --> 35:07.702
Guys, we're just
trying to get back.

35:07.704 --> 35:09.570
It's not so much
the technology,

35:09.572 --> 35:11.238
it's the hoof!

35:11.240 --> 35:13.208
Can't reach those
little buttons.

35:14.644 --> 35:16.244
So, on the
cell phone...

35:16.246 --> 35:18.445
do you have
one or not?

35:18.447 --> 35:20.347
Maybe you could
just point us

35:20.349 --> 35:23.284
in the general
direction of the road.

35:23.286 --> 35:26.323
Road... road?

35:34.965 --> 35:36.831
That way.

35:39.802 --> 35:43.438
Say... I'm curious.

35:43.440 --> 35:45.340
What happened
to that, uh,

35:45.342 --> 35:47.242
pretty little thing
you were with?

35:47.244 --> 35:48.409
Oh, yeah.

35:48.411 --> 35:49.443
My wife?

35:49.445 --> 35:50.778
Ooh.

35:50.780 --> 35:52.914
"My wife?"

35:52.916 --> 35:55.516
She's around.

35:55.518 --> 35:57.554
Around where?

36:00.523 --> 36:02.356
She's around.

36:02.358 --> 36:03.724
Probably shopping.

36:03.726 --> 36:05.526
With the mooses.

36:07.297 --> 36:08.796
For a cell phone!

36:10.467 --> 36:11.733
How about
a radio?

36:11.735 --> 36:13.001
Mm, radio?

36:13.003 --> 36:14.568
Got a radio?

36:14.570 --> 36:15.836
Radio?

36:15.838 --> 36:18.974
Oh, hey, know
what? I got one.

36:18.976 --> 36:21.275
Perfect.

36:21.277 --> 36:22.776
But it don't work.

36:22.778 --> 36:23.912
Aww.

36:23.914 --> 36:26.414
Nope. Damn thing
crapped out on us.

36:26.416 --> 36:28.782
Cheap gook
piece of shit.

36:28.784 --> 36:30.684
Do you mind if I
take a look at it?

36:30.686 --> 36:33.521
You want to
look at my radio?

36:33.523 --> 36:35.657
What, you don't think
I can understand

36:35.659 --> 36:38.260
a basic electronical
device, convict?

36:38.262 --> 36:39.728
Is that what
you're saying to me?

36:39.730 --> 36:42.264
And you're gonna
help me with that?

36:42.266 --> 36:44.432
- Lefty?
- Yeah.

36:44.434 --> 36:45.833
What's that
word say?

36:45.835 --> 36:47.501
It's, uh... "on".

36:47.503 --> 36:50.838
On! Jumping Jesus
on a gump stump!

36:50.840 --> 36:52.574
That's the problem.

36:53.943 --> 36:55.909
Hell, it is a damn
good thing that this

36:55.911 --> 36:57.845
ex-convict wandered
through here with his

36:57.847 --> 37:00.048
taxpayer prison
education and all.

37:00.050 --> 37:02.516
City folk...
damn smart.

37:02.518 --> 37:04.853
Yeah, I just figured
out my toaster last week.

37:04.855 --> 37:06.720
It makes toast!

37:06.722 --> 37:08.759
Can I use the
radio or not?

37:11.327 --> 37:13.028
I don't think so.

37:13.030 --> 37:14.561
Look, I don't know
where all this

37:14.563 --> 37:15.896
hostility's
coming from,

37:15.898 --> 37:17.632
but we're just
trying to get back.

37:17.634 --> 37:18.999
'cause, hell,
I don't know...

37:19.001 --> 37:21.001
having an ex-convict
in our midst...

37:21.003 --> 37:23.003
I mean, it's nothing
personal, son,

37:23.005 --> 37:25.039
but importing
convicted criminals

37:25.041 --> 37:27.008
into our own backyard...
is that cool, guys?

37:27.010 --> 37:28.342
Nah.

37:28.344 --> 37:29.376
No.

37:29.378 --> 37:30.644
Nope.

37:30.646 --> 37:31.845
I paid my debt.

37:36.753 --> 37:39.887
Hot damn. That's
good to know.

37:39.889 --> 37:42.393
Seriously, I'm
done kidding around.

37:54.838 --> 37:58.340
Come on, Max.

37:58.342 --> 37:59.773
Ah, hell, kid...

37:59.775 --> 38:02.610
ha ha! we're just
kidding around!

38:02.612 --> 38:03.912
We're having
some fun!

38:05.715 --> 38:06.847
Just kidding.

38:06.849 --> 38:09.717
We got a CB in
the truck. Right?

38:09.719 --> 38:10.686
Yup.

38:10.688 --> 38:13.121
We can get you there
in, what, about an hour?

38:13.123 --> 38:14.054
Yeah.

38:14.056 --> 38:15.356
Maybe four.

38:15.358 --> 38:17.394
We can get him
there in about an hour.

38:35.644 --> 38:37.445
You know, I'm
still curious...

38:37.447 --> 38:38.912
What happened to
that pretty little

38:38.914 --> 38:40.581
wife of
yours anyway?

38:40.583 --> 38:41.950
I told you,
she's around.

38:41.952 --> 38:43.584
Whoa! Whoa!

38:43.586 --> 38:45.686
Oh!

38:45.688 --> 38:48.021
Survey says
thank you, Jesus!

38:48.023 --> 38:50.791
Speak of
the devil.

38:50.793 --> 38:53.461
We had the
accident.

38:53.463 --> 38:54.963
Is that what you
kids are calling it

38:54.965 --> 38:56.498
these days?

38:56.500 --> 38:59.666
Ah, hell, I got a boner
a cat couldn't scratch!

38:59.668 --> 39:02.871
Hey! Keep that
shit in your pants.

39:02.873 --> 39:04.671
Alright, listen up.

39:04.673 --> 39:06.708
These two
fine citizens,

39:06.710 --> 39:08.842
well, they, uh...
they need our help.

39:08.844 --> 39:10.811
And us being...
you know,

39:10.813 --> 39:13.680
good samaritans and
all... we're obliged to

39:13.682 --> 39:15.883
help 'em any
way we can.

39:15.885 --> 39:19.586
So with that being said,
I want you all to treat

39:19.588 --> 39:23.425
our new guests here
with the utmost respect.

39:25.728 --> 39:26.728
Shut up.

39:26.730 --> 39:27.996
Sorry.

39:27.998 --> 39:30.798
Hey! That means keep
that shit in your pants!

39:30.800 --> 39:34.635
All of ya's...
you hear?

39:34.637 --> 39:35.603
Yes, sir.

39:35.605 --> 39:37.104
Yeah.

39:37.106 --> 39:38.639
Okay.

39:38.641 --> 39:39.974
Yes.

39:39.976 --> 39:45.079
Alright... let's
pack it up.

39:45.081 --> 39:50.121
We're moving
out. Let's go!

39:56.927 --> 39:58.693
There's something
in these woods.

39:58.695 --> 40:00.894
We gotta go.

40:00.896 --> 40:02.400
Come on.

40:03.500 --> 40:05.999
Here you go,
sweetheart.

40:06.001 --> 40:07.637
Get going.

40:14.177 --> 40:18.079
Hey...
there you go.

40:18.081 --> 40:20.718
Thank you.

40:30.927 --> 40:33.827
Yeah, alignment's off,
the gears are stripped.

40:33.829 --> 40:36.530
Car was put in park,
moved sideways,

40:36.532 --> 40:38.666
then forward
off the road.

40:38.668 --> 40:40.834
It was pushed?

40:40.836 --> 40:42.836
I don't know
about pushed.

40:42.838 --> 40:46.273
Are you
sure, Nelson?

40:46.275 --> 40:47.941
Well, maybe the
transmission got

40:47.943 --> 40:50.581
knocked there
during the accident.

40:59.088 --> 41:00.590
Yeah, maybe.

41:16.873 --> 41:18.273
Bigfoot got 'em.

41:18.275 --> 41:20.008
Big goddamn
footy-mother,

41:20.010 --> 41:24.177
bushy, effin'
tall-ass hairy bastard.

41:24.179 --> 41:25.682
You know it!

41:31.887 --> 41:34.190
Sure as eggs is
eggs, Cochise.

42:45.929 --> 42:47.327
Now that we got
you here, uh...

42:47.329 --> 42:49.229
we're not so
bad, are we?

42:49.231 --> 42:51.298
Hell, you could
be in the South...

42:51.300 --> 42:53.200
Hey, Lefty. Are
we in the South?

42:53.202 --> 42:54.802
No, no, we're
not in the South.

42:54.804 --> 42:56.838
Do you even know
where the South is?

42:56.840 --> 42:58.373
Yeah, it's
in the South.

42:58.375 --> 43:01.075
I mean, hell, you know,
we as a community...

43:01.077 --> 43:04.679
we really don't mind
you convicts just

43:04.681 --> 43:06.780
waltzing through
our homes, right?

43:06.782 --> 43:07.949
Yeah.

43:07.951 --> 43:10.217
I'm sorry...
ex-convicts.

43:12.054 --> 43:13.755
So you want to
revisit this again?

43:13.757 --> 43:15.289
Just hear me
out, alright?

43:15.291 --> 43:18.025
I mean, hell, our
wives and our schools,

43:18.027 --> 43:20.961
they actually find it
enriching, you know,

43:20.963 --> 43:24.365
this close proximity
to such a wealth of...

43:24.367 --> 43:27.001
hell, what's the
word I'm looking for?

43:27.003 --> 43:29.336
How about
"rehabilitation"?

43:29.338 --> 43:32.840
Man, that's
a word and a half.

43:32.842 --> 43:34.041
Sure is.

43:34.043 --> 43:36.177
Looks like
our ex-convict's

43:36.179 --> 43:38.713
got himself
a vocabulary.

43:38.715 --> 43:41.115
Yeah, but that's
not the word

43:41.117 --> 43:42.883
I was
thinking about.

43:42.885 --> 43:45.385
Then what is the word
you were looking for?

43:45.387 --> 43:50.992
Uh... I don't know.
Something, uh...

43:50.994 --> 43:53.961
less fitting for
mixed company, I guess.

43:55.864 --> 43:57.999
You know we're
going the wrong way?

44:01.271 --> 44:03.271
The sun rises
in the East.

44:03.273 --> 44:06.407
So that's East.
We're going West.

44:06.409 --> 44:08.742
We're going to our
trucks, young lady...

44:08.744 --> 44:11.445
and our trucks
are this way.

44:11.447 --> 44:13.817
It's where the
CB is, darlin'.

44:44.179 --> 44:46.246
Body and spirit look
like they're going

44:46.248 --> 44:48.516
north and south.

44:48.518 --> 44:50.784
I'm joking.

44:50.786 --> 44:52.753
You look
like shit.

44:52.755 --> 44:55.923
Well, thank
you very much.

44:55.925 --> 44:58.191
Go see the
Whispering Woman?

44:58.193 --> 44:59.226
Hell, no.

44:59.228 --> 45:00.528
Scares you,
doesn't she?

45:00.530 --> 45:02.195
No!

45:02.197 --> 45:03.798
Okay, yeah.

45:03.800 --> 45:05.199
Yeah, me too.

45:05.201 --> 45:07.934
Verna Six
Trees has cancer.

45:07.936 --> 45:10.338
They're having a peyote
ceremony for her,

45:10.340 --> 45:12.139
you should come.

45:12.141 --> 45:14.976
Verna Six Trees...

45:14.978 --> 45:18.880
well, I really
hate those things.

45:18.882 --> 45:21.883
They go on forever,
smoke burns my eyes,

45:21.885 --> 45:23.550
I get piles.

45:23.552 --> 45:26.253
Take the medicine.
Have a vision.

45:26.255 --> 45:28.356
Offset all this white
man law and order,

45:28.358 --> 45:30.258
you need to be
reminded that you're

45:30.260 --> 45:32.059
a part of
Mother Earth.

45:32.061 --> 45:33.994
Teach you to be
nurturing, loving,

45:33.996 --> 45:36.063
forgiving,
self-healing.

45:37.867 --> 45:40.066
Go ahead,
make fun of me.

45:40.068 --> 45:44.938
Timing's perfect.
Must mean something.

45:44.940 --> 45:47.374
Like a scheduled
airplane out of the blue.

45:47.376 --> 45:49.976
Where are they
holding the ceremony?

45:49.978 --> 45:51.479
At Mama
Day's farm.

45:51.481 --> 45:53.046
Not the
reservation?

45:53.048 --> 45:54.014
Not the Res.

45:54.016 --> 45:57.217
Reservation depresses
the shit out of me.

45:57.219 --> 45:59.122
You drive.

46:12.235 --> 46:15.271
Hey, ex-convict.
Come here.

46:19.342 --> 46:21.275
I have a name.

46:21.277 --> 46:23.313
Well, hell, I
don't know it.

46:30.519 --> 46:32.019
It's Max.

46:32.021 --> 46:33.854
Max, huh?

46:36.525 --> 46:39.327
Everybody...
meet Max.

46:41.097 --> 46:42.262
Hi, Max.

46:42.264 --> 46:43.898
Maxi pad.

46:43.900 --> 46:46.099
Hi, Max.

46:46.101 --> 46:51.505
Well, there, Max.
You know how I can tell

46:51.507 --> 46:54.008
that you just
got out, son?

46:54.010 --> 46:58.479
Well, you ever seen an
ex-con eat his food?

46:58.481 --> 47:01.315
Yeah, well, they
guard it, you know?

47:01.317 --> 47:05.019
In a situation, or a
scenario, if you will,

47:05.021 --> 47:08.623
when they clearly don't
need to, they wrap it up,

47:08.625 --> 47:11.559
hide it... like
someone's gonna come by

47:11.561 --> 47:14.961
and steal it from them
when clearly no one is.

47:14.963 --> 47:17.000
And...?

47:19.635 --> 47:21.401
And...

47:21.403 --> 47:27.173
Well, Max.
That's how you are...

47:27.175 --> 47:30.311
with that pretty
little wife of yours.

47:30.313 --> 47:32.412
She's my wife.

47:32.414 --> 47:34.248
It's still rude.

47:34.250 --> 47:36.316
Excuse me for trying
to protect my wife.

47:36.318 --> 47:38.619
Besides, I don't
think she's your type.

47:38.621 --> 47:40.588
That's no excuse
for being rude.

47:40.590 --> 47:42.088
Ain't no
social graces.

47:42.090 --> 47:46.128
Hicks!
Stand down.

47:49.565 --> 47:52.266
Now look at what
you gone and done.

47:52.268 --> 47:54.501
You upset my
boys here.

47:54.503 --> 47:57.037
I believe this
calls for an, uh...

47:57.039 --> 47:58.305
atonement!

47:58.307 --> 48:00.240
Okay, enough!
We appreciate

48:00.242 --> 48:02.543
the fact that your
radio does not work.

48:02.545 --> 48:07.081
What? No, no. The
radio works. Right?

48:07.083 --> 48:10.050
It, uh... well, it
doesn't transmit.

48:10.052 --> 48:12.320
Sure it does, I was
just using it earlier.

48:12.322 --> 48:13.621
I was
talking to...

48:13.623 --> 48:15.289
Okay, the
radio works?!

48:15.291 --> 48:16.958
Yeah!

48:16.960 --> 48:18.726
Uh, no...

48:18.728 --> 48:21.128
I meant, um,
something else.

48:21.130 --> 48:22.697
Radio's broken.

48:22.699 --> 48:25.398
I gotta pee!

48:25.400 --> 48:26.367
Get back here!

48:26.369 --> 48:27.200
I gotta pee!

48:27.202 --> 48:28.369
Get back...

48:28.371 --> 48:30.371
Why you
gotta run?

48:30.373 --> 48:33.541
Eze! Get your
butt over here.

48:33.543 --> 48:35.141
What?

48:35.143 --> 48:36.309
Go get him.

48:36.311 --> 48:37.510
He's peeing.

48:37.512 --> 48:39.546
I don't care! You ain't
holding it for him!

48:39.548 --> 48:41.148
Go get him!

48:41.150 --> 48:42.682
So mean.

48:42.684 --> 48:44.418
Don't get
your ass lost!

48:44.420 --> 48:45.418
Shut up!

48:45.420 --> 48:46.188
Go!

48:49.659 --> 48:51.559
I swear,
that kid...

48:51.561 --> 48:54.597
he'd lose his head if
it wasn't attached.

48:57.099 --> 48:58.699
Ah, you're it.

48:58.701 --> 49:00.700
Come on, man.

49:00.702 --> 49:02.702
We don't have
BD on our asses,

49:02.704 --> 49:04.537
we can at least
have a little fun.

49:04.539 --> 49:06.474
I have fun.

49:06.476 --> 49:09.043
When's the last time
you really had fun?

49:09.045 --> 49:11.345
I don't know, yesterday
we went fishing...

49:11.347 --> 49:12.713
remember that?

49:12.715 --> 49:14.514
Hold on, I'm gonna
stop for a minute.

49:14.516 --> 49:16.650
I really actually do
have to take a piss.

49:16.652 --> 49:18.184
You do that.

49:18.186 --> 49:20.054
I plan to,
thank you.

49:20.056 --> 49:22.358
'Preciate your
permission to urinate.

49:29.331 --> 49:30.563
Oh, boy...

49:30.565 --> 49:31.731
Ohh...

49:31.733 --> 49:33.666
You in dutch
with BD, Gord.

49:33.668 --> 49:35.068
Yeah, no shit.

49:35.070 --> 49:36.403
He gonna
hide you.

49:36.405 --> 49:39.373
Yeah, that's why I'm out
here and not with him.

49:42.512 --> 49:45.079
What was that?

49:45.081 --> 49:48.215
Hey!

49:48.217 --> 49:51.519
Ah, shit! Peed on
my goddamn leg.

49:51.521 --> 49:53.753
Hey, Critter,
what's...

49:53.755 --> 50:02.095
Critter? Critter?

50:02.097 --> 50:03.400
Shit!

50:08.371 --> 50:11.407
Critter, Critter...

50:13.643 --> 50:15.842
Critter?

50:21.650 --> 50:23.152
What...?

51:11.900 --> 51:13.400
Fuck you, BD.

51:13.402 --> 51:14.802
"Don't get lost"...

51:14.804 --> 51:16.840
fuck you. I do
what I want.

51:23.679 --> 51:27.213
Hello?

51:27.215 --> 51:30.217
Critter!

51:30.219 --> 51:31.318
Dammit.

51:31.320 --> 51:33.753
Gordy!

51:33.755 --> 51:34.790
Critter!

51:46.235 --> 51:48.271
No...

51:52.742 --> 51:54.275
Critter!

51:54.277 --> 51:55.311
Anybody?

52:17.666 --> 52:18.701
Fuck.

53:13.289 --> 53:14.655
Augh!

53:14.657 --> 53:16.557
Ow!

53:16.559 --> 53:18.492
Ugh.

53:18.494 --> 53:22.563
Dammit!

53:27.503 --> 53:30.336
Oh, God!

54:21.356 --> 54:24.724
Shh shh.
You hear that?

54:24.726 --> 54:26.626
Hear what?

54:26.628 --> 54:28.929
Sounds like
them boys is

54:28.931 --> 54:31.498
sodomizing
each other again!

54:34.036 --> 54:35.903
Sorry we're
keeping you.

54:35.905 --> 54:37.403
What?

54:37.405 --> 54:38.771
Well, you sound
like a man of means.

54:38.773 --> 54:40.106
Shut up,
all of you.

54:40.108 --> 54:41.508
I was
just joking.

54:41.510 --> 54:42.376
Right.

54:42.378 --> 54:43.510
I said shut it!

54:43.512 --> 54:44.945
What the fuck
is going on?

54:44.947 --> 54:47.780
So the radio works...
great! Good news.

54:47.782 --> 54:50.883
Maybe... maybe
it doesn't.

54:50.885 --> 54:55.054
Hell, you see, this
here hunting expedition...

54:55.056 --> 54:57.624
it's not exactly
on the up and up.

54:57.626 --> 54:58.592
You know?

54:58.594 --> 55:00.894
So you're keeping your
criminal activities

55:00.896 --> 55:02.463
from him?

55:02.465 --> 55:04.664
Not so much, it's
just not wanting to

55:04.666 --> 55:06.666
broadcast it all
over the airwaves.

55:06.668 --> 55:09.001
At the gas station
you all were loading up

55:09.003 --> 55:11.104
for a hunting party right
in front of the sheriff.

55:11.106 --> 55:12.805
We hadn't killed
anything yet.

55:12.807 --> 55:14.742
You haven't
killed anything now.

55:14.744 --> 55:15.912
Not yet.

55:18.947 --> 55:20.414
Ah, hell,
sweet buns.

55:20.416 --> 55:22.115
What are you so concerned
about anyway, huh?

55:22.117 --> 55:23.684
We've been more
than accommodating,

55:23.686 --> 55:25.084
- am I right?
- Yeah.

55:25.086 --> 55:25.885
That's enough!

55:25.887 --> 55:27.420
Hold on... let
me make the call.

55:27.422 --> 55:28.621
We'll just pretend
you're not here.

55:28.623 --> 55:29.557
How 'bout that?

55:29.559 --> 55:32.825
Honeybunch, it just
don't work that way.

55:32.827 --> 55:34.862
Then how
does it work?

55:34.864 --> 55:36.963
Well, you see, it
works like this.

55:36.965 --> 55:40.601
We have guns!
Lots of 'em.

55:40.603 --> 55:43.637
You...

55:43.639 --> 55:45.572
you ain't even
wearing pants!

55:52.014 --> 55:57.117
Jesus, Trout! It
wasn't that funny.

56:11.867 --> 56:13.635
What the fuck
was that?!

56:17.039 --> 56:18.704
What the
fuck was that?

56:18.706 --> 56:19.742
Eze!

56:24.547 --> 56:26.012
Goddammit, Frank!

56:33.621 --> 56:36.789
Quit shooting,
Frank! Dammit!

56:38.027 --> 56:39.159
Frank!

56:39.161 --> 56:41.528
Frank, what
do you see?

56:41.530 --> 56:43.229
Goddammit! Jesus!

56:44.699 --> 56:47.166
Frank! Quit
shooting, goddammit!

56:47.168 --> 56:48.937
Go! Go!

56:53.175 --> 56:55.075
Get the fuck
off me!

56:55.077 --> 56:56.809
What do you
see, Frank?

56:58.112 --> 56:59.479
Frank!

56:59.481 --> 57:00.746
Goddammit, Frank!

57:00.748 --> 57:02.483
What are you
shooting at?!

57:44.293 --> 57:47.693
Max?

57:47.695 --> 57:49.929
It's me. Wake up.

57:49.931 --> 57:51.233
Wake up...

01:00:38.701 --> 01:00:40.003
Auugh!

01:02:28.577 --> 01:02:30.079
Max...

01:02:45.159 --> 01:02:46.461
Ashley...

01:02:56.471 --> 01:02:58.240
Oh, Jesus.

01:04:01.436 --> 01:04:02.135
Hey.

01:04:02.137 --> 01:04:04.336
Hi. Oh, so
good to see you.

01:04:04.338 --> 01:04:06.373
Come on in,
see everybody.

01:04:06.375 --> 01:04:08.974
Hi.

01:04:08.976 --> 01:04:11.144
Nice to have
you here.

01:04:11.146 --> 01:04:13.479
Please, welcome.

01:05:17.112 --> 01:05:19.682
Come on.
We're ready.

01:09:14.481 --> 01:09:18.785
Auuugh!

01:14:57.324 --> 01:15:02.061
Help! Help!

01:16:44.865 --> 01:16:54.005
Ah. Ah... ah.

01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:48.797
There he is.

01:17:50.398 --> 01:17:51.930
How long
was I out?

01:17:51.932 --> 01:17:54.032
All night.

01:17:54.034 --> 01:17:56.434
Where's Ashley?

01:17:56.436 --> 01:17:59.304
Here's the deal.

01:17:59.306 --> 01:18:03.442
There's a creature,
lives in these woods,

01:18:03.444 --> 01:18:06.778
as ancient as my
tribe remembers.

01:18:06.780 --> 01:18:08.781
The legend says that
when our chiefs die

01:18:08.783 --> 01:18:11.951
they come back, their
spirits, as the Oh-Mah.

01:18:11.953 --> 01:18:13.218
The what?

01:18:13.220 --> 01:18:16.388
It's where the legend
of Sasquatch comes from.

01:18:16.390 --> 01:18:18.456
We're talking
about Bigfoot?

01:18:18.458 --> 01:18:24.062
This woman
watches the Oh-Mah.

01:18:24.064 --> 01:18:26.499
She said it
stopped at you.

01:18:26.501 --> 01:18:27.967
It got prideful.

01:18:27.969 --> 01:18:30.468
Its pride distracted
it and it got shot.

01:18:30.470 --> 01:18:34.173
It's down an arm,
which means no arrows,

01:18:34.175 --> 01:18:36.474
which means it's
out of balance.

01:18:36.476 --> 01:18:40.178
Since it's hurt, we stand
a chance to take it down.

01:18:40.180 --> 01:18:44.383
She said the Oh-Mah
took your wife, Ashley.

01:18:44.385 --> 01:18:49.120
She has a chance
if we fight it.

01:18:49.122 --> 01:18:52.391
This Oh-Mah, it's
a sentry, sort of,

01:18:52.393 --> 01:18:54.360
watching over the
periphery of the forest

01:18:54.362 --> 01:18:57.028
where it lives and it
has seen the workings

01:18:57.030 --> 01:18:59.964
of man's chaos and
evil for too long.

01:18:59.966 --> 01:19:02.500
It put it out
of balance.

01:19:02.502 --> 01:19:04.536
So we're talking
about a Bigfoot

01:19:04.538 --> 01:19:06.972
that's... what...
crazy?

01:19:06.974 --> 01:19:07.973
No.

01:19:07.975 --> 01:19:12.111
Well... kinda.
Sort of.

01:19:12.113 --> 01:19:13.512
A lot,
actually.

01:19:13.514 --> 01:19:14.479
Awesome.

01:19:14.481 --> 01:19:17.016
I guess that's just
bad luck for us, huh?

01:19:17.018 --> 01:19:17.983
Not really.

01:19:17.985 --> 01:19:21.085
A man out of balance is
easier to knock over.

01:19:21.087 --> 01:19:23.188
Is that Native
American wisdom?

01:19:23.190 --> 01:19:25.089
Hell, I just
made it up.

01:19:25.091 --> 01:19:27.092
So, yeah.

01:19:27.094 --> 01:19:30.361
It's time
to go, Max.

01:19:30.363 --> 01:19:31.866
Now.

01:19:32.533 --> 01:19:35.099
These are
Oh-Mah's weapons.

01:19:35.101 --> 01:19:36.268
We need 'em.

01:19:36.270 --> 01:19:37.570
Don't we
have guns?

01:19:37.572 --> 01:19:40.004
Its primary sense is
its sense of smell.

01:19:40.006 --> 01:19:42.141
It can smell
gunpowder a mile away.

01:19:42.143 --> 01:19:47.012
It will stalk you and gut
you before you can say

01:20:29.457 --> 01:20:31.490
This will
hide your smell.

01:20:31.492 --> 01:20:33.829
Get plenty
of it on you.

01:20:36.264 --> 01:20:37.833
Oh, God.

01:22:10.323 --> 01:22:11.690
We good?

01:22:11.692 --> 01:22:13.929
We bad.

01:23:39.646 --> 01:23:43.848
Get off!
Get off me!

01:23:43.850 --> 01:23:45.753
Get off!!!

01:24:00.301 --> 01:24:03.367
Whoever it is, they're
coming for you, asshole!

01:24:03.369 --> 01:24:05.571
They're coming
for you!

01:26:20.774 --> 01:26:23.811
So, uh... what
is the plan?

01:26:28.314 --> 01:26:31.817
You find
your wife.

01:26:31.819 --> 01:26:36.591
You find your wife,
you go back to your boy.

01:28:28.668 --> 01:28:32.306
Aauuugh!

01:28:36.143 --> 01:28:38.442
Auuugh!

01:28:43.082 --> 01:28:44.719
Auuugh!

01:29:12.112 --> 01:29:13.881
Auuugh!

01:31:21.975 --> 01:31:23.010
Psst!

01:31:56.109 --> 01:31:59.009
Wait... wait!

01:32:24.037 --> 01:32:27.237
Go... go!

01:32:48.729 --> 01:32:50.629
I shot him
in the back...

01:32:50.631 --> 01:32:54.031
and then I got him
in the front too.

01:32:57.203 --> 01:32:58.937
Come on...

01:33:04.144 --> 01:33:05.809
Listen to him.

01:33:05.811 --> 01:33:07.678
Come on.

01:33:14.887 --> 01:33:15.922
Ughh!

01:33:26.033 --> 01:33:27.699
Go.

01:33:27.701 --> 01:33:28.933
No.

01:33:28.935 --> 01:33:30.300
Run as fast
as you can.

01:33:30.302 --> 01:33:31.803
No. Absolutely not.

01:33:31.805 --> 01:33:33.804
Don't stop til you
get to the road.

01:33:33.806 --> 01:33:35.139
Max, no!

01:33:35.141 --> 01:33:36.176
Ashley!

01:33:46.953 --> 01:33:49.724
Go! Go!

01:34:11.011 --> 01:34:12.876
Come on.

01:34:12.878 --> 01:34:14.111
Right here...

01:34:14.113 --> 01:34:15.746
come on!!

01:34:15.748 --> 01:34:17.715
Come here!

01:34:27.060 --> 01:34:30.794
That's it.
Come here!

01:34:30.796 --> 01:34:32.397
Come on!

01:34:38.037 --> 01:34:39.339
Come on!

01:34:48.414 --> 01:34:50.447
Come on!

01:35:23.350 --> 01:35:24.549
Oh, shit!

01:37:19.099 --> 01:37:20.598
Auugh!

01:37:20.600 --> 01:37:22.200
Auuugh!

01:37:22.202 --> 01:37:26.036
Auugh!
