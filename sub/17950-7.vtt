THE TWO HALVES OF THE CROWN

00:28.896 --> 00:29.897

00:29.897 --> 00:31.999
SIR HIGH LORD KING OF PRANKS.

00:31.999 --> 00:33.067

00:42.476 --> 00:46.347
[whip cracks]

00:46.347 --> 00:48.282

WHAT YOU FEEL *

01:07.000 --> 01:08.969
* NEVER QUIT

01:08.969 --> 01:12.273
- * WHEN YOU ROLL BIG TIME

01:12.273 --> 01:13.274

01:17.345 --> 01:19.347

01:30.291 --> 01:32.960

01:32.960 --> 01:36.264
* IF YOU WANT IT ALL,
LAY IT ON THE LINE *

01:36.264 --> 01:40.734
* IT'S THE ONLY LIFE YOU GOT
SO YOU GOT TO LIVE IT BIG TIME *

01:45.239 --> 01:47.308
- MOM, I LOVE YOU,

01:47.308 --> 01:48.776
BUT THE DAY OF PRANKS
WILL HAPPEN.

01:48.776 --> 01:50.478
- AND I WILL BE KING.
- NO, I WILL.

01:50.478 --> 01:51.779
- I SHALL RULE
THE LAND OF PRANKS.

01:51.779 --> 01:53.581
- AND YOU CAN'T KEEP TRACK
OF WHAT WE DO TODAY.

01:53.581 --> 01:55.183
THERE'S ONLY ONE OF YOU,
AND FIVE OF US.

01:55.183 --> 01:56.417
- YEAH, WELL,

01:56.417 --> 02:00.188
I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE
WHO HATES THE DAY OF PRANKS.

02:01.822 --> 02:03.324
- IT STINKS.
- WE HATE IT.

02:03.324 --> 02:04.492
- WORST HOLIDAY EVER.

02:04.492 --> 02:06.760
- YOU GUYS,
WE NEED YOU IN THE STUDIO.

02:06.760 --> 02:09.397
- NOT RUNNING AROUND
PLAYING IDIOTIC PRANKS.

02:09.397 --> 02:12.366
- AND WHO DO YOU THINK HAS TO
CLEAN UP YOUR MESS-O-MANIA?

02:12.366 --> 02:14.668
- UH, I DO.

02:14.668 --> 02:17.238
- YES, BUT I HAVE TO CALL YOU
TO MAKE YOU DO IT.

02:17.238 --> 02:18.572
- YEAH,
BUT I TOTALLY DON'T MIND--

02:18.572 --> 02:19.773
- STOP IT.

02:19.773 --> 02:20.774
- YOUR LAST DAY OF PRANKS

02:20.774 --> 02:23.344
COST MY COMPANY
$20,000 IN DAMAGES

02:23.344 --> 02:26.514
AND $17,000 IN PIE FILLING.

02:26.514 --> 02:29.717
- SO NOW IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU GUYS ARE OUTNUMBERED.

02:29.717 --> 02:32.586
- WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU GUYS ARE OLD-NUMBERED.

02:32.586 --> 02:33.621
adults: COME AGAIN?

02:33.621 --> 02:35.223
- DON'T YOU GUYS REMEMBER

02:35.223 --> 02:37.024
WHAT IT'S LIKE TO HAVE FUN

02:37.024 --> 02:38.392
AND BE A KID?

02:38.392 --> 02:39.760
- I KNOW HOW TO HAVE FUN;

02:39.760 --> 02:42.062
I JUST CHOOSE NOT TO HAVE IT.

02:42.062 --> 02:44.265
- I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW
I CAN STILL DO

02:44.265 --> 02:45.799
THE MID-AIR SKY-HIGH
SPLIT KICK

02:45.799 --> 02:48.269
LIKE I DID
WHEN I WAS ON CHEER SQUAD.

02:48.269 --> 02:49.737
- WELL, THEN
PROVE YOU'RE STILL A KID

02:49.737 --> 02:53.474
AND JOIN YE DAY OF PRANKS.

02:53.474 --> 02:55.743
- KIDS VERSUS ADULTS.

02:55.743 --> 02:57.245
both: IF YOU CAN HANDLE IT.

02:57.245 --> 02:58.646
adults: YOU'RE ON.

02:58.646 --> 03:00.080
- WAIT, DID WE JUST SAY THAT?

03:00.080 --> 03:03.251
- DO YOU GUYS
WANT TO READ THE RULES?

03:03.251 --> 03:05.253
- HERE'S THE ONLY RULE
WE NEED TO KNOW.

03:05.253 --> 03:08.055
WHEN WE WIN THIS STUPID CROWN,

03:08.055 --> 03:11.859
I'M ABOLISHING
THE DAY OF PRANKS FOREVER.

03:11.859 --> 03:13.026
- SO BE IT.

03:13.026 --> 03:14.895
PRANKS COMMENCE IN ONE HOUR.

03:14.895 --> 03:16.830
IN FOR YE INFORMATION,

03:16.830 --> 03:18.899
WE ARE NO LONGER OUTNUMBERED.

03:18.899 --> 03:20.033
YE ARE.

03:20.033 --> 03:21.702
- WAIT.
WHO'S MISSING?

03:24.405 --> 03:27.408
[funky guitar music]

03:27.408 --> 03:35.349
*

03:40.721 --> 03:43.291
- WHY YOU GUYS
ALL WALKING SO SLOWLY?

03:43.291 --> 03:44.858
OOH, AND LOOKING SO DANGEROUS?

03:44.858 --> 03:46.860
I WANT TO BE DANGEROUS.

03:46.860 --> 03:48.128
- STOP IT.

03:51.031 --> 03:52.466
- ALL RIGHT, LISTEN UP.

03:52.466 --> 03:54.602
WE CAN'T LET AN ADULT WIN,
BECAUSE IF THEY DO,

03:54.602 --> 03:57.070
THEY WILL CANCEL
THE DAY OF PRANKS FOREVER.

03:57.070 --> 03:58.872
- SO AS CO-REIGNING KING,

03:58.872 --> 04:02.142
I DECREE THAT WE FORM ALLIANCES
AND DESTROY THE ADULTS.

04:02.142 --> 04:04.312
- I'VE GOT MY TEAM.

04:04.312 --> 04:07.615
- AND I ALIGNETH WITH...

04:07.615 --> 04:08.616
LUCY.

04:08.616 --> 04:10.117
- I'M NOT TEAMING UP WITH YOU.

04:10.117 --> 04:11.952
AND DON'T SAY YOU WILL BE MINE,

04:11.952 --> 04:13.120
BECAUSE I'LL NEVER BE YOURS.

04:13.120 --> 04:15.523
- HO-HO, YOU WILL BE--

04:15.523 --> 04:17.157
- NO ALLIANCES ARE NEEDED.

04:17.157 --> 04:19.693
FOR I WILL TAKE OUT
ALL SEVEN ADULTS

04:19.693 --> 04:21.662
WITH ONE TIN CAN OF FREE MINTS.

04:21.662 --> 04:23.631
BUT WHEN THEY OPEN THE TIN,

04:23.631 --> 04:26.066
THEY WILL FIND NO MINTS.

04:26.066 --> 04:27.968
INSTEAD,
THEY WILL FIND 100 POUNDS

04:27.968 --> 04:29.470
OF PRESSURIZED SNEEZE POWDER.

04:29.470 --> 04:32.139
[laughs]

04:32.139 --> 04:33.240
[coughs]

04:33.240 --> 04:34.342
- OKAY.

04:34.342 --> 04:36.043
NEW RECORD
FOR LOGAN PRANKING HIMSELF OUT.

04:36.043 --> 04:37.911
AND THE REST OF YOU, SPLIT UP!

04:42.416 --> 04:45.586
[coughs]

04:45.586 --> 04:46.587
[sneezes]

04:46.587 --> 04:49.423
- OKAY, OUR STRATEGY IS SIMPLE.

04:49.423 --> 04:51.124
THEY ARE CHILDREN.

04:51.124 --> 04:53.427
- SO BE ON THE LOOKOUT
FOR CHILDISH PRANKS.

04:53.427 --> 04:54.428
- YEAH.

04:54.428 --> 04:56.597
- JUST FOLLOW MY LEAD, GEEZERS.

04:56.597 --> 04:59.199
I CAN SPOT A PRANK A MILE AWAY.

04:59.199 --> 05:01.168
AND I'M BRINGING THE THUNDER.

05:01.168 --> 05:02.169
[phone ringing]
- YEAH!

05:02.169 --> 05:03.671
- HANG ON.

05:03.671 --> 05:04.672
PALMWOODS.

05:04.672 --> 05:06.674
JUST A SECOND.
I'LL CHECK.

05:06.674 --> 05:08.008
ATTENTION, RESIDENTS.

05:08.008 --> 05:09.677
I.P. FREELY,

05:09.677 --> 05:11.011
YOU HAVE A PHONE CALL.

05:11.011 --> 05:14.382

05:14.382 --> 05:16.484
[kids laughing]
WAIT.

05:16.484 --> 05:19.520
[laughter]

05:19.520 --> 05:21.922
- A CRANK PHONE CALL, REALLY?

05:21.922 --> 05:24.392
A CRANK IS NOT A PRANK.

05:24.392 --> 05:26.627
- THE SEYMOUR BUTTS AMENDMENT.

05:26.627 --> 05:27.961
"CRANK PHONE CALLS

05:27.961 --> 05:31.399
DO HEREBY OFFICIALLY COUNT
AS A PRANK."

05:31.399 --> 05:32.933
- YOU SHOULD HAVE READ THE BOOK.

05:32.933 --> 05:34.468
- OKAY.

05:34.468 --> 05:37.471
WELL, I GUESS
I'M NOT BRINGING THE THUNDER.

05:37.471 --> 05:40.307
- LOOK.
WE FEEL BAD.

05:40.307 --> 05:42.309
- SO TO MAKE IT
MORE INTERESTING,

05:42.309 --> 05:44.244
WE'LL GIVE YOU GUYS
A FIVE-SECOND HEAD START.

05:50.217 --> 05:51.318
- OKAY.

05:51.318 --> 05:53.987
ONE DOWN; SIX TO GO.

05:53.987 --> 05:56.990
- [chuckling]

05:56.990 --> 05:58.091
AH.

05:58.091 --> 06:00.160
THE OLD LEAKY DUCT PRANK.

06:00.160 --> 06:01.729
PEOPLE WALK BY;
THEY SAY,

06:01.729 --> 06:03.731
"OH, DID I JUST GET LEAKED ON?"

06:03.731 --> 06:05.433
NO, YOU JUST GOT PRANKED.

06:05.433 --> 06:08.335
[laughs]

06:11.439 --> 06:13.240
OH, YEAH.

06:13.240 --> 06:14.608
HMM?

06:14.608 --> 06:16.610

06:16.610 --> 06:18.779
- SORRY, BUDDY,
YOU JUST GOT PRANKED.

06:18.779 --> 06:19.747
- [gasps]

06:21.982 --> 06:23.183
smack!
[yelps]

06:28.155 --> 06:29.523
WHAT'S IT SAY ON MY BUTT?

06:31.459 --> 06:32.660
smack!
OH!

06:35.463 --> 06:36.464
- HELP.

06:36.464 --> 06:37.798
KELLY DE-WHOOPEED MY CUSHIONS,

06:37.798 --> 06:39.967
AND NOW SHE'S AFTER ME
WITH FART SPRAY.

06:39.967 --> 06:41.869
- UM, OKAY, I'M OUT,
SO JUST USE ONE OF MY PRANKS.

06:41.869 --> 06:42.903
HERE.
- OKAY.

06:44.705 --> 06:46.073
- HA!
FART PRANK!

06:46.073 --> 06:47.174
- [roars

06:47.174 --> 06:48.876
- [screaming]

06:48.876 --> 06:49.877
- HA!

06:49.877 --> 06:51.044
YOU'RE OUT.

06:51.044 --> 06:53.146
- WHAT?
HOW AM I OUT?

06:53.146 --> 06:55.716
- SCREAMS, SCARES,
AND HEART SKIPS

06:55.716 --> 06:56.884
COUNT AS PRANKS.

06:56.884 --> 06:58.952
SHOULD HAVE READ THE BOOK.

06:58.952 --> 07:02.890
- WELL, THE BOOK IS STUPID.

07:02.890 --> 07:05.493
- [laughs]

07:05.493 --> 07:06.660
WOW.

07:06.660 --> 07:09.162
YOU'RE LIKE
A DANGEROUS SUPPLIER OF PRANKS.

07:09.162 --> 07:10.197
- REALLY?

07:10.197 --> 07:11.499
LIKE A--

07:11.499 --> 07:12.900
LIKE A PRANKSTA-GANGSTA?

07:12.900 --> 07:15.402
ONE THAT WEARS A COOL JACKET
AND AN EYE PATCH?

07:15.402 --> 07:16.970
- UM, NO, NO.

07:16.970 --> 07:18.305
I WASN'T SAYING THAT.

07:18.305 --> 07:19.272
- HA-HA.

07:21.509 --> 07:22.743
SPREAD THE WORD.

07:22.743 --> 07:25.112
IF A KID IS IN NEED OF A PRANK,
THEY SHOULD COME SEE

07:25.112 --> 07:26.914
THE PRANKSTA-GANGSTA.

07:34.755 --> 07:37.324
- OOH.

07:37.324 --> 07:39.593
- ON.

07:39.593 --> 07:40.628
- YOU SHOULD DATE ME.

07:40.628 --> 07:42.095
- YOU'RE NOT MY TYPE.

07:42.095 --> 07:46.133
- OH, SO YOUR TYPE
IS NOT GORGEOUS AND AMAZING

07:46.133 --> 07:47.601
AND SENSITIVE?

07:47.601 --> 07:50.270
- MY TYPE IS NOT SELF-CENTERED
OR NARCISSISTIC

07:50.270 --> 07:52.039
WITH AN ADONIS COMPLEX.

07:52.039 --> 07:53.841
- YEAH, WELL,
MY TYPE IS NOT BIG WORD GIRL.

07:53.841 --> 07:55.142
AND I'M DONE.

07:55.142 --> 07:57.945
YOU JUST LOST A FIRST-CLASS
TICKET ON AIR DIAMOND.

07:57.945 --> 07:59.046
AND THERE'S NO STAND-BY...

07:59.046 --> 08:01.549
UNLESS YOU WANT TO MAKE OUT.

08:01.549 --> 08:02.449
- ON.

08:04.184 --> 08:05.953
- I KICKED LUCY OFF AIR DIAMOND.

08:08.856 --> 08:11.024
- I HEAR YOU CAN GET US PRANKS.

08:11.024 --> 08:12.860
- I CAN GET A LOT OF THINGS.

08:12.860 --> 08:14.695
DEPENDS ON THE THINGS
THAT YOU NEED.

08:14.695 --> 08:16.063
WHAT THOSE THINGS ARE FOR.

08:16.063 --> 08:17.631
- WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

08:17.631 --> 08:19.567
- I SAY A LOT OF THINGS
TO A LOT OF PEOPLE,

08:19.567 --> 08:21.201
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

08:21.201 --> 08:23.436
- WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU MEAN.

08:23.436 --> 08:26.373
- WE NEED A PRANK
TO GET ALL THE ADULTS OUT

08:26.373 --> 08:28.075
SO I CAN PRANK ALL OF YOU

08:28.075 --> 08:29.977
AND RULE THE DAY OF PRANKS!

08:36.717 --> 08:38.919
- THAT'S IT,
A SCONE PICNIC?

08:38.919 --> 08:40.153
- NO.

08:40.153 --> 08:41.755
THERE'S ONE MORE THING.

08:42.990 --> 08:44.658
- THEY'VE PRANKED THREE OF OURS,

08:44.658 --> 08:46.594
AND WE HAVEN'T TAKEN
ONE OF THEIRS.

08:46.594 --> 08:47.595
- I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE.

08:47.595 --> 08:48.729
THEY'RE TOO GOOD.

08:48.729 --> 08:50.297
THEY'RE COMING AFTER ME NEXT,
I KNOW IT!

08:50.297 --> 08:51.464
- CALM DOWN.

08:51.464 --> 08:53.601
WE JUST NEED TO RELAX, REGROUP,
AND RECHARGE.

08:55.603 --> 08:56.604
- OOH!

08:56.604 --> 08:57.605
SCONES.

08:57.605 --> 08:58.739
- [yelps]
slap!

08:58.739 --> 08:59.740
COULD BE A PRANK.

08:59.740 --> 09:00.908
- GOOD POINT.

09:00.908 --> 09:02.776
ABDUL, WOULD YOU--

09:02.776 --> 09:04.211
WOULD YOU MIND TAKING A SEAT?

09:04.211 --> 09:05.846
- [sighs]

09:11.084 --> 09:14.154
- HOW'S THE CHAIR?
IS IT, UM, RELAXING?

09:14.154 --> 09:15.856
- YEAH, IT'S OKAY.

09:17.625 --> 09:19.426
- HOW ABOUT THE SCONES?

09:22.529 --> 09:23.697
- [screams]

09:23.697 --> 09:25.365
splash!

09:28.101 --> 09:31.872
- 80-POUND
DEEP-SEA FISHING WIRE.

09:31.872 --> 09:32.873
VIRTUALLY INVISIBLE.

09:32.873 --> 09:35.342
- AND LORD PRANKERTON-APPROVED.

09:35.342 --> 09:36.343
- [spits]

09:36.343 --> 09:38.178
- SO DO YOU ADULTS
WANT TO GIVE UP

09:38.178 --> 09:40.547
