Cheers is filmed
before a live studio audience.

00:04.120 --> 00:05.553
(bell ringing)

00:05.588 --> 00:07.655
Oh, here you go,
pal. Let me, uh...

00:07.689 --> 00:08.823
(laughs) Sorry.

00:08.857 --> 00:10.658
I don't have any change on me.

00:10.659 --> 00:12.527
That's all right.
God bless you anyway.

00:12.528 --> 00:13.728
FRASIER:
Hey, Sam.

00:13.762 --> 00:15.530
Hey, Frasier, how
you doing, man?

00:15.531 --> 00:17.215
I tell you, I used to
have change all the time,

00:17.216 --> 00:18.383
but things are tough now.

00:18.384 --> 00:20.786
The bar burned down, you know.

00:20.887 --> 00:22.337
This is the place right here.

00:22.371 --> 00:23.638
Yeah, burned down,

00:23.673 --> 00:25.740
and I've been spending
every dime I have

00:25.775 --> 00:27.575
just to rebuild the place.

00:27.576 --> 00:29.911
I don't have anyone to
blame but myself really.

00:29.912 --> 00:31.145
And women. Oh, God.

00:31.180 --> 00:32.313
(laughs)

00:32.348 --> 00:33.715
Me and women.

00:33.716 --> 00:35.100
Oh. Yeah, I tell
you, I think...

00:35.101 --> 00:37.369
I think it first started for me

00:37.370 --> 00:40.138
when I hired this really bright,
blonde waitress, you know.

00:40.139 --> 00:41.606
Her name was Diane.

00:41.607 --> 00:42.857
Maybe you heard about her.

00:42.858 --> 00:44.325
Used to come in and out
of here all the time.

00:44.326 --> 00:46.427
Five years ago,
books under her arm...

00:46.756 --> 00:50.931
And then Rebecca, you
know, finally admitted,

00:50.932 --> 00:52.800
"Yeah, I burned
the bar down."

00:52.835 --> 00:54.352
I forgave her.

00:54.386 --> 00:55.670
Good night, Sam.

00:55.705 --> 00:57.289
Yeah, good night, Fras!

00:57.290 --> 00:58.472
And then, listen to this.

00:58.473 --> 00:59.640
Rebecca finally

00:59.641 --> 01:01.609
admits to me, "Yes, I
burned the bar down."

01:01.610 --> 01:03.111
(whoops) Was I mad, I tell you.

01:03.112 --> 01:04.412
But what are you gonna do?

01:04.413 --> 01:06.547
Are you gonna stick her
with guilt the rest of...

01:06.548 --> 01:08.116
Sam?
Yeah?

01:08.150 --> 01:09.283
There you go.

01:09.318 --> 01:10.451
Thank you.

01:10.485 --> 01:12.854
Come this way. Oh.

01:12.888 --> 01:14.189
Here you go.

01:14.223 --> 01:16.123

Hey, guys.

02:04.790 --> 02:06.558
Oh, hey, Sam.
Hey, listen, uh,

02:06.559 --> 02:08.759
my folks sent me
a Christmas ham, and I wanted

02:08.761 --> 02:10.161
to surprise Kelly,
so I'm putting him

02:10.162 --> 02:12.497
in your office till the last
minute. Is that all right?

02:12.498 --> 02:13.915
Fine with me.
Sure it will keep?

02:13.916 --> 02:15.182
WOODY:
Oh, sure.

02:15.217 --> 02:17.401
(squealing)

02:17.436 --> 02:20.204
Unless some city boy
lets him out.

02:20.238 --> 02:23.041
(squealing)

02:23.075 --> 02:25.193
Oh, Woody, look.

02:25.227 --> 02:27.361
He's so cute.

02:27.396 --> 02:29.747
(baby talk):
Yes, you are. You're so sweet.

02:29.782 --> 02:31.382
Oh, he's shivering.

02:31.383 --> 02:33.017
Should we cover
him with something?

02:33.018 --> 02:34.135
Well, not really.

02:34.136 --> 02:36.654
Maybe with some honey glaze
and a little pineapple.

02:36.655 --> 02:38.189
That is disgusting.

02:38.223 --> 02:40.090
I can't believe
you'd even think

02:40.125 --> 02:42.259
about killing
something this sweet.

02:42.260 --> 02:44.261
Rebecca, where do you think
hams come from?

02:44.262 --> 02:47.181
Big, funny-shaped
cans on aisle six.

02:47.216 --> 02:49.183
(squealing)

02:49.218 --> 02:52.987
Actually, I'm something
of an expert on that subject.

02:53.021 --> 02:55.273
Big, funny-shaped cans?

02:55.307 --> 02:57.475
No, Carla.

02:57.509 --> 02:59.510
I happen to be a swine buff.

02:59.545 --> 03:02.913
You see,
your porcine mammal is known

03:02.948 --> 03:05.115
for his superior intelligence.

03:05.150 --> 03:06.200
Well, that's true.

03:06.201 --> 03:07.502
You know, back in Hanover,

03:07.503 --> 03:09.613
they say pigs are smarter
than the people.

03:09.614 --> 03:12.406
Actually, it's usually
the tourists who point that out.

03:12.407 --> 03:13.624
(door opening)

03:16.112 --> 03:18.079
Excuse me.

03:18.114 --> 03:20.081
I'm looking for Sam Malone.

03:20.116 --> 03:21.582
I'm Sam.
What can I do for you?

03:21.617 --> 03:23.351
Oh. I'm, uh, Susan Methany.

03:23.385 --> 03:25.853
My husband Kirby
bought your Corvette.

03:25.854 --> 03:27.505
(liquid pouring,
glass clinking)

03:27.506 --> 03:29.074
You... You've seen my Corvette?

03:29.108 --> 03:30.875
Is it parked outside right now?

03:30.876 --> 03:32.627
Wait. Oh, how is she?
How's she doing?

03:32.628 --> 03:34.028
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

03:34.062 --> 03:36.664
Let me... Let me get my shammy
from the office here!

03:36.699 --> 03:39.067
No! Mr. Malone,
it-it's not here.

03:39.101 --> 03:40.768
I just came here to ask

03:40.769 --> 03:41.786
a few questions about it.

03:41.787 --> 03:42.987
SAM:
Oh. Oh.

03:43.022 --> 03:46.224
I'm sorry. I got a
little carried away.

03:46.258 --> 03:50.161
You see, um, Kirby passed
away a couple months ago.

03:50.195 --> 03:52.163
Oh. Well,
that is bad news.

03:52.197 --> 03:55.166
It wasn't a car crash, was it?

03:55.200 --> 03:56.917
Oh, no, no.

03:56.952 --> 03:58.786
It-It was a
heart attack.

03:58.820 --> 04:00.855
Oh, thank God.

04:00.889 --> 04:02.006
Oh, I'm sorry.

04:02.040 --> 04:05.110
I mean, thank God that he's,
uh, not suffering anymore.

04:05.144 --> 04:06.844
I'm sorry.
That came out wrong.

04:06.879 --> 04:08.079
Let me... Sit down. Let me...

04:08.114 --> 04:09.924
Let me buy you a
coffee or something.

04:09.949 --> 04:11.616
Thank you.

04:11.650 --> 04:15.152
Um... boy, that must be really
tough on you right now, huh?

04:15.187 --> 04:18.022
Well, it's been a little rough,
but I'm getting over it.

04:18.057 --> 04:19.356
Yeah.

04:19.357 --> 04:20.625
And part of getting over it

04:20.625 --> 04:22.727
is dealing with all
the details, like the car.

04:22.728 --> 04:23.862
Oh.

04:23.896 --> 04:26.197
My lawyer says I need
the vehicle ID number,

04:26.232 --> 04:27.531
and I can't find it.

04:27.566 --> 04:32.202
That's U510593947-D.

04:32.237 --> 04:33.905
Oh, I'm sorry.

04:33.939 --> 04:34.989
What am I doing?

04:34.990 --> 04:36.958
Let me... Let me write
this down for you.

04:36.959 --> 04:39.894
Although I, uh, do have
kind of a cute way of remembering this.

04:39.895 --> 04:41.396
Uh, I made up a little song.

04:41.430 --> 04:42.697
Want to hear it?

04:42.698 --> 04:43.881
Yeah. I-I'm a kindergarten
teacher.

04:43.882 --> 04:45.950
I get my fill
of cute little songs.

04:45.985 --> 04:47.118
All right.

04:47.119 --> 04:48.853
Maybe you could
just write it down.

04:48.854 --> 04:50.088
Sure.

04:50.090 --> 04:51.990
So, Susan.

04:52.024 --> 04:54.826
So, what are you
gonna do with the car?

04:54.860 --> 04:55.994
Um, I don't know.

04:56.028 --> 04:58.096
I-I was just keeping it
in the garage.

04:58.097 --> 05:00.198
I'm perfectly happy
driving my Volkswagen.

05:00.199 --> 05:01.349
Excuse me.

05:01.383 --> 05:04.085
Is that garage heated?

05:04.120 --> 05:06.020
Oh, yes, yes.

05:06.055 --> 05:07.521
Kirby insisted.

05:07.556 --> 05:10.858
He was a little nuts
about the car, sweet as he was.

05:10.893 --> 05:11.943
Okay, there you go.

05:11.944 --> 05:13.211
Oh, thank you.

05:13.245 --> 05:14.462
Do you have a pay phone?

05:14.463 --> 05:17.031
Uh, my lawyer said I should
call him with the number.

05:17.032 --> 05:18.633
Oh! Uh, here. No.

05:18.634 --> 05:20.417
As a matter of fact,
use this one right here.

05:20.418 --> 05:22.753
There you go.
Hey, guys...

05:22.788 --> 05:24.598
I'm sorry. I'm just
a little excited

05:24.623 --> 05:26.791
about your husband, uh...

05:30.112 --> 05:31.712
(quietly):
Hey, fellas.

05:31.746 --> 05:33.464
(laughs)

05:33.499 --> 05:34.965
You know that guy Kirby

05:34.966 --> 05:36.401
who, uh, bought my Corvette?

05:36.402 --> 05:38.436
Dead.

05:38.470 --> 05:40.154
Yeah.

05:40.155 --> 05:41.839
Sorry, I can't be
happy for you, Sam.

05:41.840 --> 05:44.141
I didn't know
him like you did. No, no, no.

05:44.175 --> 05:46.978
No, no. No, I'm not happy
that the guy had a heart attack.

05:47.012 --> 05:50.247
It's just that this is a chance
for me to get my Corvette back.

05:50.281 --> 05:52.850
Oh, so, how do you figure
you're gonna get the car?

05:52.884 --> 05:54.535
Oh, uh, that lady right there...

05:54.536 --> 05:55.787
that's, uh...
that's the widow.

05:55.788 --> 05:56.988
So, I figure, what?

05:56.989 --> 05:59.073
You know, I just take her out
to dinner a few times,

05:59.074 --> 06:00.508
let her get
to know me, you know,

06:00.509 --> 06:01.776
pour on the charm,
and then, boom.

06:01.777 --> 06:03.310
I'll lowball her, you know?

06:03.311 --> 06:06.030
Well, this calls for a round
on the house, huh? Come on.

06:06.031 --> 06:09.216
I don't have my car yet, man.

06:09.217 --> 06:11.402
You, uh, kind of jumped the gun
on that one, huh, Norm?

06:11.403 --> 06:15.306
Thank you, Mr. Monday
Morning Quarterback.

06:15.307 --> 06:16.340
Thanks, Mr. Malone.

06:16.341 --> 06:17.661
I won't bother you anymore.

06:17.676 --> 06:19.577
Oh, uh, hold on
one second, there.

06:19.611 --> 06:21.445
Let me just, uh...

06:22.848 --> 06:24.916
Don't know how
to say this, but, uh,

06:24.917 --> 06:27.051
I can only imagine what
you're going through

06:27.052 --> 06:28.352
and everything at this point.

06:28.353 --> 06:31.388
I just want you to know that
if you ever want to talk,

06:31.423 --> 06:34.659
I'm a bartender, and that's
what I'm paid to do. I listen.

06:34.660 --> 06:36.393
Well, thank you.
That's nice of you.

06:36.394 --> 06:38.128
Yeah. Actually, you
know, what the heck.

06:38.129 --> 06:39.597
I got a break right now.

06:39.631 --> 06:40.932
You want to

06:40.966 --> 06:44.668
take a walk in the park,
maybe, and just... talk?

06:44.703 --> 06:47.805
All right, I'd like that.

06:47.839 --> 06:48.989
Great, all right.

06:48.990 --> 06:51.692
It'd be nice talking to someone
who's not six years old.

06:51.693 --> 06:52.826
Yeah, I'll bet.

06:52.861 --> 06:55.496
I'm getting my car back!

07:00.502 --> 07:02.252
You are such a good boy.

07:02.287 --> 07:03.688
(snorts) Yes, you are!

07:03.722 --> 07:06.423
Yes, you did,
you used your litter box again!

07:07.860 --> 07:10.495
Oh, he would make the best pet.

07:10.529 --> 07:14.198
Hey, Woody,
would you consider selling him?

07:14.232 --> 07:15.949
No, but I'll share him.

07:15.984 --> 07:17.352
You will?

07:17.353 --> 07:20.471
Sure. The day after Christmas,
I'll bring you some sandwiches.

07:20.472 --> 07:23.257
Woody, why would you
say things like that?

07:23.291 --> 07:24.876
Miss Howe, I think

07:24.877 --> 07:27.278
you're getting a little
too attached to this pig.

07:27.279 --> 07:28.980
I am not, am I, Snuffles?

07:29.014 --> 07:31.448
No, I'm not getting
too attached to you.

07:35.738 --> 07:37.872
Whoa, Sammy, what's up?

07:37.873 --> 07:39.640
You're breaking out
the good stuff.

07:39.641 --> 07:41.659
Yeah. Susan's coming over again.

07:41.694 --> 07:44.829
So, Sam, how are things
between you and Susan?

07:44.830 --> 07:46.730
Oh, uh, you know,
pretty good, pretty good.

07:46.731 --> 07:48.699
You know, I take her out,
we talk.

07:48.733 --> 07:51.869
We talk about school,
about Kirby, life.

07:51.904 --> 07:53.737
You know, everything
under the sun.

07:53.772 --> 07:55.673
Funny thing is,
the more we talk,

07:55.707 --> 07:57.207
the more she likes me.

07:57.242 --> 07:59.910
The more she likes me,
the more she trusts me.

07:59.945 --> 08:01.746
And the more she trusts me,

08:01.780 --> 08:04.882
the closer I get to
snagging that car.

08:04.916 --> 08:08.452
Did anyone else's blood
just run cold?

08:08.487 --> 08:09.887
Oh, come on.

08:09.888 --> 08:11.589
I'm not doing
anything wrong here.

08:11.590 --> 08:12.857
Give me a break, man.

08:12.858 --> 08:15.259
You know, I'm helping her
out, as a matter of fact.

08:15.260 --> 08:16.794
She's going through some
pretty difficult times.

08:16.795 --> 08:18.396
I'm taking her mind off of it.

08:18.430 --> 08:20.732
In other words,
you deserve that car.

08:20.766 --> 08:22.700
Well, I didn't want to say it,

08:22.735 --> 08:25.202
but I'm glad someone
sees it my way, yeah.

08:25.203 --> 08:26.537
All right! Well,
let's celebrate, huh?

08:26.538 --> 08:28.505
This calls for a round
on the house.

08:28.540 --> 08:31.392
No, no, no, I haven't gotten
the car quite yet, Norm.

08:31.427 --> 08:33.794
You're severely
off your game, my friend.

08:33.828 --> 08:36.914
Game? You call this a game?

08:38.783 --> 08:41.736
Sammy, I don't know why you're
going to all this trouble.

08:41.770 --> 08:45.038
She told you that she keeps
the car in a garage, right?

08:45.073 --> 08:48.676
You say the words, my kids
are over there in 20 minutes.

08:50.078 --> 08:52.430
In 25, your car
is speeding down the highway.

08:52.464 --> 08:54.098
Worse comes to worse,

08:54.132 --> 08:56.467
they put them away
for a couple of years.

08:56.501 --> 08:57.802
I mean, it's not like

08:57.836 --> 08:59.804
I'm rattling around
in an empty house.

08:59.805 --> 09:00.771
You're very sweet.

09:00.772 --> 09:02.039
I appreciate that,
but, you know,

09:02.040 --> 09:04.374
I've put a lot of energy
and time into this plan.

09:04.375 --> 09:06.010
I think I'm gonna
stick with it.

09:06.044 --> 09:07.244
(door opening)

09:07.279 --> 09:09.630
(singsongy):
Where is Aunt Carla?

09:09.665 --> 09:11.549
There's Aunt Carla.

09:13.168 --> 09:16.570
Isn't he the cutest
thing you've ever seen?

09:16.571 --> 09:18.473
Yeah. He's gonna make
a nice football.

09:18.474 --> 09:20.008
(whispering)

09:20.042 --> 09:21.409
What are you gonna do?

09:21.443 --> 09:23.777
I'm gonna save a life.

09:23.812 --> 09:26.222
I'm gonna drive Snuffles way out
in the country

09:26.248 --> 09:27.982
and give him his freedom.

09:27.984 --> 09:29.783
He'll be free!

09:29.818 --> 09:31.285
Free, I tell you!

09:31.320 --> 09:32.640
And he'll always remember

09:32.654 --> 09:35.489
the person who gave him
his freedom- Rebecca Howe.

09:35.523 --> 09:37.992
This is the best thing
I've ever done.

09:40.128 --> 09:44.048
I don't mind saying,
that is one screwed up broad.

09:47.452 --> 09:48.636
Hey, Susan.

09:48.670 --> 09:50.021
Hi, Sam.

09:50.055 --> 09:51.325
Can I get you something?

09:51.356 --> 09:52.657
Juice and cookies?

09:52.691 --> 09:54.993
Uh, it was arts
and crafts today.

09:54.994 --> 09:56.226
Make it bourbon and water.

09:56.227 --> 09:57.361
(laughs)

09:57.395 --> 09:58.562
Sam?

09:58.596 --> 09:59.830
Yeah.

09:59.864 --> 10:03.167
I've got to tell you,
this past week has been great.

10:03.201 --> 10:05.252
You've really pulled me
out of my shell.

10:05.253 --> 10:06.504
Well, I'm glad to hear that.

10:06.505 --> 10:07.721
Guess what.
What?

10:07.756 --> 10:09.390
I brought the Corvette.

10:09.425 --> 10:11.292
Oh!

10:11.326 --> 10:13.460
Oh, my old car, right.

10:13.495 --> 10:14.728
Yeah, I almost forgot.

10:14.763 --> 10:16.630
Yeah. Uh,

10:16.664 --> 10:18.516
it's blue, right?

10:18.550 --> 10:19.867
No, red.

10:19.901 --> 10:20.968
Red, red, right.

10:21.002 --> 10:22.169
Right, right.

10:22.203 --> 10:23.671
Flame red, actually, but...

10:23.705 --> 10:27.525
It felt kind of weird
driving it.

10:27.559 --> 10:28.609
Oh!

10:28.610 --> 10:30.561
Well, yeah, of course
it did, of course.

10:30.562 --> 10:31.996
Why didn't I think of that?

10:32.030 --> 10:34.699
Yeah, it reminds
you of Kirby. Yeah.

10:34.700 --> 10:35.649
You know, it's
none of my business,

10:35.650 --> 10:36.817
but I'm gonna say this anyway.

10:36.818 --> 10:38.136
I think you should sell it.

10:38.137 --> 10:40.505
I'm having a thought here.

10:40.539 --> 10:42.940
Maybe...

10:42.974 --> 10:44.808
Maybe...

10:44.843 --> 10:46.511
No, that's crazy, that's crazy.

10:46.545 --> 10:47.595
Well, what? What?

10:47.613 --> 10:49.980
Well, I-I was just
gonna say that,

10:50.015 --> 10:53.217
you know, if-if you're gonna
sell it, and, like we said,

10:53.252 --> 10:55.019
we think you should,

10:55.053 --> 10:57.221
then, um,

10:57.255 --> 10:59.507
why don't you sell it to me?

10:59.541 --> 11:00.824
Oh, Sam.

11:00.859 --> 11:03.294
No, you don't have
to do that for me.

11:03.328 --> 11:05.863
No! No, I
insist, I insist.

11:05.898 --> 11:08.265
See, my-my only problem
is that I don't think

11:08.300 --> 11:10.835
I can afford the
fair market value.

11:10.869 --> 11:12.870
You know, maybe only like

11:12.905 --> 11:17.125
ten grand over the
next two years?

11:17.159 --> 11:19.293
You know what?

11:19.328 --> 11:20.894
Let's do it.

11:20.929 --> 11:22.430
I-I-I never drive it,

11:22.464 --> 11:25.065
and-and you love it,
so it's yours.

11:25.100 --> 11:27.001
Great. I think
this is a great idea.

11:27.035 --> 11:30.137
I tell you what- let me, uh,
let me go get a check,

11:30.171 --> 11:32.761
and, uh, we'll go out to dinner
and we'll celebrate.

11:33.442 --> 11:35.993
Oh, what are you guys
celebrating?

11:36.028 --> 11:37.995
I just sold Sam my car.

11:38.030 --> 11:40.031
Oh, that's great.

11:40.065 --> 11:42.266
That's all he's been
talking about.

11:44.203 --> 11:46.170
Really?

11:46.205 --> 11:47.304
Oh, yeah.

11:47.305 --> 11:48.873
Well, he's had his eye
on that car

11:48.874 --> 11:50.684
since the day you walked
in the door.

11:54.179 --> 11:56.480
Okay, here we go.

11:56.481 --> 11:58.182
Here's the check.
Uh, do me a favour,

11:58.183 --> 12:00.150
do not cash this right away.

12:00.185 --> 12:01.985
You know, Sam,

12:02.020 --> 12:04.522
if you wanted my car so badly,

12:04.556 --> 12:06.290
all you had to do was ask.

12:06.324 --> 12:08.626
I mean, you didn't have to, uh,

12:08.660 --> 12:11.762
waste a week pretending
to be my friend.

12:11.797 --> 12:13.547
Here- take it.

12:21.657 --> 12:23.624
How about that.

12:23.659 --> 12:26.426
I got my car back.

12:29.648 --> 12:32.466
Didn't cost me a penny!

12:32.501 --> 12:34.902
(chanting):
Sammy! Sammy!

12:34.936 --> 12:36.303
Come on, come on. Sammy!

12:36.940 --> 12:39.056
Come on, you'll have fun.

12:39.057 --> 12:40.190
Sammy! Sammy!

12:47.365 --> 12:49.917
Woody, we're running
low on pretzels.

12:49.951 --> 12:51.251
I know, Miss Howe.

12:51.286 --> 12:54.221
I set them all free
to live in the wild.

12:57.042 --> 13:00.093
Woody, I let your pig
go three days ago

13:00.128 --> 13:01.698
and I've apologized every day.

13:01.729 --> 13:02.996
Let's just drop it.

13:02.997 --> 13:04.882
There is a quarter
of an inch scratch

13:04.883 --> 13:05.917
on the right fender.

13:05.918 --> 13:07.051
You can't miss it.

13:07.052 --> 13:08.119
No!

13:08.120 --> 13:10.087
It disfigures the entire car!

13:10.122 --> 13:14.191
Listen, I want you to send
your tow truck over right now.

13:14.226 --> 13:15.893
Are you laughing at me?

13:15.927 --> 13:17.778
Are you laughing at me?

13:17.779 --> 13:19.814
You know, fine, I'll
tell you something.

13:19.815 --> 13:22.082
I'm gonna take my business
some place else.

13:23.151 --> 13:25.235
Sam, may I have a beer please?

13:25.270 --> 13:28.556
And let me guess-
you dinged the Corvette again.

13:28.557 --> 13:29.273
Yeah.

13:29.274 --> 13:30.624
Boy, I don't know, it's weird.

13:30.625 --> 13:32.626
It's the fourth scratch
I've had in a week.

13:32.627 --> 13:33.861
I don't know what's going on.

13:33.862 --> 13:35.863
Maybe I need to check my eyes
or something.

13:35.864 --> 13:38.465
Yes. Your eyes.

13:38.500 --> 13:40.851
Oh, what's that
supposed to mean, huh?

13:40.885 --> 13:43.387
Sam, this is not
a personal attack.

13:43.422 --> 13:44.855
I am trying to help you.

13:44.889 --> 13:48.192
Look, the way you got that car
back was shameful.

13:48.226 --> 13:50.328
It went against
your better instincts.

13:50.362 --> 13:51.561
Now, deep down,

13:51.562 --> 13:53.864
you don't think you deserve
to have that car,

13:53.865 --> 13:55.866
and I submit
that subconsciously

13:55.901 --> 13:58.068
you are trying to destroy it!

13:58.069 --> 13:59.770
Hey, you know, take your
business someplace else!

13:59.771 --> 14:01.605
Go on! Get out of here!

14:01.639 --> 14:03.774
NORM:
Sammy!

14:03.808 --> 14:05.459
Sammy, settle down now!

14:05.460 --> 14:07.595
Frasier could very well
have a point there!

14:07.596 --> 14:08.829
You know something?!

14:08.830 --> 14:09.830
Or maybe not, okay?

14:09.831 --> 14:11.565
The guy's a quack.

14:11.599 --> 14:13.450
Sammy.

14:13.485 --> 14:14.684
Sammy!

14:14.719 --> 14:17.854
You scammed a poor, innocent
widow out of her car.

14:17.889 --> 14:20.891
Now, on many levels,
I can respect that.

14:20.925 --> 14:24.261
But somehow, this one
crossed the line.

14:24.295 --> 14:25.762
I know, you're right.

14:25.796 --> 14:26.996
Yeah, and another thing.

14:26.997 --> 14:29.600
Remember what I told you
about hitting the customers?

14:29.601 --> 14:30.801
Yeah, I know.
I-I forgot.

14:30.802 --> 14:32.169
That's-That's your turf.

14:32.187 --> 14:35.823
It's-It's just that
I have so little.

14:35.824 --> 14:36.874
I know.

14:41.646 --> 14:43.614
I'm sorry, you...
I'm sorry, Frasier.

14:43.615 --> 14:45.315
I'm-I'm under a lot
of pressure here.

14:45.316 --> 14:48.285
I mean, I should be having fun
with that car, and I'm not.

14:48.319 --> 14:51.288
It's driving me crazy.

14:51.322 --> 14:53.791
Do you really think
there's something to that,

14:53.825 --> 14:56.794
you know, subconscious
guilt and shame stuff?

14:56.828 --> 14:58.796
It depends.

14:58.830 --> 15:01.114
Yeah? On what?

15:01.149 --> 15:03.267
Are you going to hit me again?

15:03.268 --> 15:04.201
Oh, no.

15:04.202 --> 15:05.235
I'm sorry, man.

15:05.236 --> 15:06.270
No, of course not.

15:06.271 --> 15:08.439
I... I know you're right.

15:08.473 --> 15:10.424
I've been feeling
like a real heel

15:10.425 --> 15:11.925
ever since she gave
me the keys.

15:11.926 --> 15:14.895
I mean, she's so sweet
and so innocent,

15:14.930 --> 15:17.230
you know, and I was just
making her believe

15:17.265 --> 15:19.767
I was her friend so I
could snag the car.

15:19.801 --> 15:22.853
Sam, you must find Susan
and beg her forgiveness.

15:22.887 --> 15:24.087
It's your only hope.

15:26.191 --> 15:27.424
Yeah, yeah.

15:27.425 --> 15:28.776
Yeah, thank you. You're right.

15:28.777 --> 15:30.160
I-I'm out of here.

15:30.195 --> 15:32.996
You know, Sammy, another way
you could go is just

15:33.031 --> 15:35.532
to get rid of the object
of your guilt.

15:35.566 --> 15:37.367
Cliff, you can't have the car.

15:37.402 --> 15:38.519
Okey dokey.

15:38.553 --> 15:39.820
(phone rings)

15:39.855 --> 15:41.788
Cheers. Hello.

15:41.823 --> 15:43.123
Hello?

15:43.158 --> 15:45.192
Cheers.

15:45.227 --> 15:48.128
Turn the phone around.

15:48.163 --> 15:50.097
Right side up.

15:51.465 --> 15:54.101
Right side up!

15:54.135 --> 15:56.103
Yeah. That's much better.

15:56.138 --> 15:58.139
Ah.

15:58.173 --> 16:00.507
Woody, it's your dad.

16:05.597 --> 16:07.531
Hi, Dad.

16:08.600 --> 16:10.568
Hello?

16:10.602 --> 16:12.536
I can't hear...

16:14.606 --> 16:16.574
Dad!

16:16.608 --> 16:18.576
You're kidding.

16:18.610 --> 16:19.910
Oh, my God.

16:19.944 --> 16:21.445
That's unbelievable.

16:21.480 --> 16:23.230
Wow! Well, that's...

16:23.265 --> 16:25.048
I'm relieved.

16:25.083 --> 16:27.050
Well, say hi to Mom, okay?

16:27.051 --> 16:28.085
All right.

16:28.086 --> 16:29.286
Bye.

16:29.397 --> 16:33.557
Miss Howe, you aren't
gonna believe this.

16:33.558 --> 16:36.208
Guess who showed up in my folk'
back door last night?

16:36.209 --> 16:37.094
Who?

16:37.095 --> 16:38.612
Snuffles.

16:38.613 --> 16:39.830
Yeah, I guess he found his way

16:39.831 --> 16:41.765
onto the back of a truck
that was headed that way.

16:41.766 --> 16:43.033
I-I told you he was smart.

16:43.067 --> 16:44.652
I can't believe this.

16:44.686 --> 16:47.320
You see, he travelled all
that distance to get home

16:47.355 --> 16:49.322
where he was safe and sound.

16:49.357 --> 16:51.124
This is a Christmas miracle.

16:51.159 --> 16:52.325
I'll say.

16:52.360 --> 16:55.445
Mom said he was delicious.

17:00.818 --> 17:03.536
Now remember, tomorrow
we're going to visit the zoo,

17:03.571 --> 17:06.073
so everybody bring
your permission slips.

17:06.107 --> 17:07.875
What's a zoo again?

17:07.909 --> 17:10.609
Uh, it's a place where they have
a lot of animals.

17:10.645 --> 17:12.329
Even tigers?

17:12.364 --> 17:14.982
Yes, they have tigers
at the zoo.

17:15.016 --> 17:16.700
What if the tigers eat us?

17:16.733 --> 17:19.537
That's why you need
your permission slips.

17:19.570 --> 17:22.106
Uh, quiet time, everybody-
hit the mats!

17:22.140 --> 17:23.272
Come on.

17:23.308 --> 17:24.508
(knocking on glass)

17:29.664 --> 17:31.448
(overlapping chatter)

17:31.483 --> 17:33.417
Shh!

17:36.271 --> 17:38.489
I am teaching class.
Yeah, I know.

17:38.523 --> 17:40.333
This'll only
take a second, please.

17:40.358 --> 17:41.408
Why are you here?

17:41.426 --> 17:42.826
I tried to call you at home,

17:42.827 --> 17:44.595
but you-you didn't
answer the phone.

17:44.596 --> 17:46.296
I-I've got to get
something off my chest.

17:46.297 --> 17:47.948
What? I mean, you got
your precious car.

17:47.949 --> 17:49.549
What else do you want from me?

17:49.550 --> 17:52.302
Susan, please, let me just try
to explain something to you.

17:52.303 --> 17:54.654
That-That car...

17:54.689 --> 17:57.024
used to be my entire life,

17:57.025 --> 17:58.708
you know, and when you...
when you got it,

17:58.709 --> 18:00.777
I-I just went crazy
for a second.

18:00.811 --> 18:01.861
I'm sorry.

18:01.863 --> 18:03.493
I really hurt you
and I'm sorry,

18:03.498 --> 18:05.665
and I-and I want to make it up
to you. Here...

18:05.700 --> 18:06.833
and I want to give you

18:06.868 --> 18:09.836
the fair market value
of the car.

18:09.871 --> 18:12.005
This check is just
the down payment.

18:12.040 --> 18:13.440
Please, I-I'm sorry.

18:15.477 --> 18:18.445
Well, you did hurt me.

18:18.480 --> 18:21.081
But I guess I understand.

18:21.115 --> 18:23.450
I mean, the car was
your whole life.

18:23.451 --> 18:24.518
Oh, thanks.

18:24.519 --> 18:25.919
So you forgive me?

18:25.953 --> 18:29.172
No, I don't forgive you.

18:29.207 --> 18:30.724
I'm sorry, what...

18:30.758 --> 18:31.825
You heard me...

18:31.859 --> 18:33.427
I don't forgive you.

18:33.461 --> 18:34.761
I mean, my whole life

18:34.762 --> 18:36.463
I-I've let people walk
all over me.

18:36.464 --> 18:37.564
And-And the minute

18:37.565 --> 18:39.466
that they start to feel
a little bit guilty,

18:39.467 --> 18:41.101
I-I let them off the hook.

18:41.136 --> 18:42.903
Well, no more.

18:42.937 --> 18:44.454
For the first time in my life,

18:44.488 --> 18:46.723
I'm not going
to forgive somebody.

18:46.757 --> 18:48.442
Yeah!

18:48.476 --> 18:49.626
(giggles)

18:49.661 --> 18:51.662
It feels good not forgiving.

18:51.696 --> 18:53.647
Yeah, well, not to me
it doesn't.

18:53.682 --> 18:55.148
I mean, listen,

18:55.149 --> 18:57.518
why-why don't you forgive me
and not forgive some other guy.

18:57.519 --> 18:59.486
You know, an every other thing.

18:59.520 --> 19:02.122
Sam, if you feel
guilty, I'm glad.

19:02.156 --> 19:03.289
You deserve it.

19:03.290 --> 19:05.025
Now excuse me. I have
a class to teach.

19:05.026 --> 19:06.527
Oh, no, listen, I'm not leaving

19:06.528 --> 19:07.661
until you forgive me.

19:07.695 --> 19:08.862
Sorry.

19:08.863 --> 19:09.913
I'm serious.

19:09.914 --> 19:12.549
Listen, this is very
important to me, Susan...

19:12.584 --> 19:13.851
Oh, my God.

19:13.885 --> 19:15.602
What did you do to those kids?

19:18.706 --> 19:20.507
(quietly):
It's quiet time.

19:20.542 --> 19:21.675
Now go.

19:21.709 --> 19:23.343
No, hey, I...

19:23.378 --> 19:27.013
I'm sitting right here
until you forgive me.

19:27.014 --> 19:29.716
All right, then you're
just gonna have to be a part of class.

19:29.717 --> 19:30.850
Whatever.
All right.

19:30.851 --> 19:32.119
All right, quiet time is over.

19:32.120 --> 19:33.320
Everybody up.

19:33.354 --> 19:34.638
Back to your chairs.

19:34.673 --> 19:36.339
Boys and girls,

19:36.340 --> 19:37.858
I would like you all
to meet someone.

19:37.859 --> 19:39.492
This is Sam.

19:39.527 --> 19:42.062
ALL:
Hi, Sam!

19:42.097 --> 19:43.530
Yeah, hi, boys and girls.

19:43.531 --> 19:45.065
Listen, I'm gonna
be sitting right here

19:45.066 --> 19:46.699
until your teacher forgives me.

19:46.700 --> 19:47.684
So you just carry on.

19:47.685 --> 19:48.835
Go ahead.

19:48.869 --> 19:51.188
Class, do you remember

19:51.222 --> 19:53.590
when we were talking
about telling the truth?

19:53.625 --> 19:55.392
ALL:
Yes.

19:55.426 --> 19:59.279
Well, Sam here told a fib.

19:59.314 --> 20:00.680
ALL:
Boo!

20:00.715 --> 20:03.050
And what

20:03.084 --> 20:04.884
kind of people tell fibs?

20:04.919 --> 20:08.221
ALL:
Bad people!

20:08.256 --> 20:10.290
Oh, wait.
Hold on a second.

20:10.325 --> 20:11.458
So, I did a bad thing.

20:11.459 --> 20:12.959
Please, just can't you
forgive me?

20:12.960 --> 20:15.529
And where do fibbers go?

20:15.563 --> 20:18.782
ALL:
In the doghouse!

20:18.816 --> 20:20.217
I'm sorry.

20:20.251 --> 20:21.385
In the what?

20:21.419 --> 20:24.388
ALL:
In the doghouse!

20:24.422 --> 20:27.057
Oh, come on, Susan,
not the doghouse.

20:27.058 --> 20:28.108
This is...

20:28.109 --> 20:31.078
Oh, come on, this is stupid.

20:31.079 --> 20:32.612
I've already given
you the check.

20:32.613 --> 20:33.913
What more do you want?

20:33.948 --> 20:36.716
Can fibbers buy their way
out of the doghouse?

20:36.750 --> 20:39.802
ALL:
No!

20:39.803 --> 20:41.371
So, why don't you just sit there

20:41.372 --> 20:43.122
and think about
what you've done?

20:44.592 --> 20:46.893
The rest of us will get
out our art supplies.

20:46.928 --> 20:49.062
ALL:
Yay!

20:49.097 --> 20:52.199
This doghouse is stupid.

20:53.535 --> 20:55.105
And it's made out of cardboard.

20:55.136 --> 20:57.937
I-I could get out of
here anytime I want.

20:57.972 --> 20:59.906
I could.

21:03.478 --> 21:06.013
Good-bye. Don't forget
your permission slips.

21:06.047 --> 21:07.981
Okay.
Bye. Bye.

21:11.119 --> 21:13.604
Sam, I've got to say,
you're quite a sport.

21:13.638 --> 21:16.940
You made it through the morning
and the afternoon classes.

21:16.975 --> 21:20.944
Yeah. Well, I'll
tell you the truth.

21:20.945 --> 21:22.212
I was going to leave
a couple hours ago

21:22.213 --> 21:25.482
but my... my legs
kind of froze up.

21:27.652 --> 21:29.653
Oh, boy!

21:29.687 --> 21:31.788
Listen, uh...

21:31.823 --> 21:34.541
I, uh... I've
been mulling it over,

21:34.575 --> 21:37.610
especially during the,
uh... quiet time,

21:37.645 --> 21:40.446
and I... I think that...

21:40.481 --> 21:42.482
I think you should
take the car back.

21:42.516 --> 21:43.867
What?

21:43.901 --> 21:45.034
Yeah. Come on.

21:45.035 --> 21:46.536
I-I'm never going
to enjoy it.

21:46.537 --> 21:48.237
I... I think
you should drive it.

21:48.272 --> 21:50.073
And please,
once again, I'm sorry.

21:50.108 --> 21:51.808
I acted like a real jerk.

21:53.678 --> 21:55.679
I forgive you.

21:55.713 --> 21:58.498
You what?

21:58.532 --> 22:01.318
I said I forgive you.

22:01.319 --> 22:02.853
I just won't
forgive the next guy.

22:02.854 --> 22:05.856
Hey, thank you.
That means a lot to me.

22:05.890 --> 22:07.557
Say, uh...
this may not be

22:07.558 --> 22:09.026
the right time or anything,

22:09.027 --> 22:11.128
but you want to
go out and grab something to eat?

22:11.129 --> 22:12.462
You serious?

22:12.497 --> 22:13.830
Yes. Yes. I-I...

22:13.865 --> 22:15.448
You know, I owe you one.

22:15.449 --> 22:17.484
You know, we spent a lot
of time together last week.

22:17.485 --> 22:20.053
I kind of miss it.

22:20.088 --> 22:22.022
All right.

22:22.056 --> 22:24.657
Why don't we take your car?

22:24.692 --> 22:26.293
My car?

22:26.327 --> 22:28.161
Are you serious?

22:28.196 --> 22:31.598
Yeah. But if you
miss one payment...

22:31.632 --> 22:34.935
Yeah. I know, I know.
In the doghouse.

22:34.969 --> 22:38.205
You'll wish.

22:38.239 --> 22:41.208
You know, for a minute there,
when you were asking me out,

22:41.242 --> 22:44.011
I thought maybe you were
trying to get to Kirby's boat.

22:44.045 --> 22:46.679
Oh, come on.

22:46.714 --> 22:49.132
Kirby had a boat?
