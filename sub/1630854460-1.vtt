WEBVTT

00:38.539 --> 00:44.127
Do people really change?
I mean, real, lasting, positive change.

00:45.462 --> 00:49.299
I sure hope so,
because we are in the business of change.

00:57.641 --> 01:01.228
Please. Please.

01:02.396 --> 01:03.730
I'm sorry.

01:06.859 --> 01:08.360
I'm so sorry.

01:10.112 --> 01:14.825
I'm sorry. I won't yell
at the neighbor's kids anymore.

01:14.908 --> 01:17.744
I'll take back the claim
against the Johnsons,

01:17.828 --> 01:20.998
even though that tree house
is a flagrant violation--

01:21.081 --> 01:24.251
I'm sorry! No! Please! I can change.

01:24.334 --> 01:29.047
I promise! Please. Please, I--

01:29.131 --> 01:32.134
Please give me another chance.
I can change!

01:33.802 --> 01:36.972
Don't worry about her. In
a few minutes, she'll wake up in her bed.

01:37.055 --> 01:40.350
Dry, rested and hopefully
a whole new person.

01:40.434 --> 01:43.645
All right! She's back in bed.
Could I get a coffee over here?

01:43.729 --> 01:45.272
Coffees flying in.

01:46.106 --> 01:49.526
You see,
this is just a supernatural simulation.

01:49.610 --> 01:50.611
And these are my colleagues,

01:50.694 --> 01:52.487
The Ghost of Christmas Past,

01:52.571 --> 01:54.698
-Christmas Yet-to-Come…
-No doubt.

01:56.074 --> 01:58.076
Oh, boy. That looks good. Thank you.

01:58.785 --> 02:03.999
And that's me. Mr. Brad Pitt.
No. No, I'm kidding.

02:04.082 --> 02:06.752
I'm The Ghost of Christmas Present.
I'm not Brad Pitt.

02:07.836 --> 02:10.672
So, you think she changed?

02:10.756 --> 02:13.050
I mean, I don't know.
This one was a serious tight-ass.

02:13.133 --> 02:14.426
Of course she's changed.

02:14.510 --> 02:16.220
I brought her face-to-face
with her mortality,

02:16.303 --> 02:18.305
and that's when I close the deal
every time.

02:18.388 --> 02:21.016
Anyone can point to a headstone.
Everyone agrees with me.

02:21.099 --> 02:22.392
-Guys, please.
-You know what?

02:22.476 --> 02:24.102
I do way more than just point at it.

02:24.186 --> 02:25.312
That hurts me.

02:25.395 --> 02:26.522
Yet-to-Come is a wrap.

02:26.605 --> 02:29.733
Inform Mr. Marley
our perp will awaken in two minutes.

02:29.816 --> 02:30.901
Copy that.

02:31.652 --> 02:32.819
Marley-san, Marley-san!

02:36.990 --> 02:38.158
-Already?
-Yeah.

02:38.242 --> 02:42.329
Excellent. Thank you, Kazuko.
Very exciting.

02:42.412 --> 02:44.998
Spirits, gather up, one and all!

02:45.082 --> 02:46.917
Research, Locations,

02:47.000 --> 02:49.002
Costume Department!

02:49.086 --> 02:51.505
This is our dedicated staff
of support ghosts.

02:52.130 --> 02:54.508
They work so hard to make us look good.

02:54.591 --> 02:56.426
Okay. We are walking.

02:56.510 --> 03:00.305
New recruits, I know you're freshly dead,
but let's look alive.

03:00.389 --> 03:02.474
You've enlisted at the perfect time.

03:02.558 --> 03:05.227
They're on their way to find out
if the person we've haunted

03:05.310 --> 03:06.895
is really going to change.

03:06.979 --> 03:08.021
Can we go see that?

03:08.105 --> 03:09.356
No. Come on.

03:14.444 --> 03:17.573
And this is the moment
we worked all year for.

03:19.157 --> 03:21.827
-No, honey, don't go in her yard!
-We don't want her calling the police.

03:21.910 --> 03:23.328
It's okay. I can get it.

03:26.415 --> 03:28.709
Sorry, Ms. Blansky.
We'll take the game down the street.

03:28.792 --> 03:30.002
We don't want any trouble today.

03:31.086 --> 03:32.254
What day is this?

03:32.337 --> 03:34.173
It's Christmas Day.

03:34.756 --> 03:37.467
-The ghosts did it all in one night.
-Are you okay?

03:38.260 --> 03:39.845
Do you need us to call someone?

03:39.928 --> 03:41.847
Or do you wanna play?

03:41.930 --> 03:42.973
Me?

03:43.056 --> 03:44.808
Sure. If you want to.

03:44.892 --> 03:48.979
After all the times I've reported you
to the HOA or called the police

03:49.062 --> 03:50.981
or stolen your packages?

03:51.064 --> 03:52.399
You did what?

03:57.863 --> 04:00.657
Go ahead. Give it a try. It's fun.

04:05.454 --> 04:06.455
Yeah!

04:42.699 --> 04:45.494
Congratulations, Ms. Blansky.

04:45.577 --> 04:47.246
I did it? You mean it's really--

04:47.329 --> 04:49.081
You're a different person now, Karen.

04:50.332 --> 04:53.335
Go make amends, and make us proud.

04:54.044 --> 04:57.005
I will. I promise you, I will!

04:58.590 --> 04:59.591
Attagirl, Karen!

04:59.675 --> 05:02.219
Appreciate it so much.
All the way in the b--

05:14.189 --> 05:15.274
Could I join in?

05:15.899 --> 05:17.067
So, that's what we do.

05:17.150 --> 05:19.778
We haunt someone,
change them into a better person,

05:19.862 --> 05:21.655
and then we sing about it.

05:22.739 --> 05:25.534
You wait for the day
You prep for a year

05:25.617 --> 05:28.328
And when the big day is finally here

05:28.412 --> 05:32.207
You take a jerk and work
To turn 'em around

05:32.291 --> 05:33.625
Why are they singing?

05:34.209 --> 05:35.627
Because this is a musical.

05:35.711 --> 05:36.962
What is?

05:37.045 --> 05:39.506
All of this. The afterlife.

05:39.590 --> 05:42.176
Yay! I had a feeling.

05:42.801 --> 05:44.011
Come on. Really?

05:46.013 --> 05:48.849
You show them their life
And you hope for the switch

05:48.932 --> 05:55.480
And when it goes off without a hitch
This Christmas train is party-bound

05:55.981 --> 05:59.067
Bring on the Chili of Positive Outcome!

05:59.151 --> 06:01.195
We're giddy with a holiday
Goodwill gleam

06:01.278 --> 06:04.489
'Cause helping out is sweeter
Than eggnog cream

06:04.573 --> 06:09.578
We might be dead
But we're living that Yuletide dream

06:09.661 --> 06:12.623
We're full of that
Christmas morning feeling

06:12.706 --> 06:15.501
Is there a morning more appealing?

06:15.584 --> 06:18.879
The magical mood when being merry
Is very necessary

06:18.962 --> 06:21.340
We're changing all mankind

06:21.423 --> 06:24.343
We planted the seeds
And joy is blooming

06:24.426 --> 06:27.429
Now we got one less hateful human

06:27.513 --> 06:29.932
We're doing the world a world of good

06:30.015 --> 06:33.185
Putting some nice
Into the neighborhood

06:33.268 --> 06:38.649
Playing our parts, changing hearts
One by one

06:38.732 --> 06:43.111
We got that Christmas morning feeling
And damn, is it fun

06:43.195 --> 06:46.031
Fa-la-la-la-la, fa-la-la-la-la

06:46.114 --> 06:50.869
Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

06:50.953 --> 06:54.164
Dude, I can't dance like this. Are you
gonna be able to keep up with all this?

06:54.248 --> 06:58.043
I mean, if I start dancing, I'm gonna shut
it down, man. Everybody gonna look bad.

06:58.126 --> 07:00.921
We're full of that
Christmas morning feeling

07:01.004 --> 07:03.924
The tingle when
Jingle bells are pealing

07:04.007 --> 07:05.592
Everything's super holly-jolly

07:05.676 --> 07:07.469
It's like we're all on Molly

07:07.553 --> 07:09.513
But it's a natural high

07:09.596 --> 07:12.683
Everything shines a little brighter

07:12.766 --> 07:15.561
I'm feeling warm as apple cider

07:15.644 --> 07:18.480
We're doing the world a world of good

07:18.564 --> 07:21.483
Feels like a kick-ass Christmas should

07:21.567 --> 07:26.446
Playing our parts, changing hearts
One by one

07:26.530 --> 07:29.825
Hey, does somebody clear out
our search history after we die?

07:30.993 --> 07:34.246
Fa-la-la-la-la, fa-la-la-la-la

07:34.329 --> 07:37.541
Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

07:37.624 --> 07:41.795
Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

07:58.812 --> 08:00.147
Excuse me, sir.

08:00.731 --> 08:02.191
Hey, Margo. I was just avoiding you.

08:02.274 --> 08:03.817
Yes, sir. I get it.

08:03.901 --> 08:07.029
But, you know, it is my job
to review your file after each haunt.

08:07.112 --> 08:11.742
So, you have been eligible for retirement
for 46 seasons.

08:11.825 --> 08:14.578
-Yeah.
-And you're still here.

08:14.661 --> 08:15.913
Like, all the time.

08:15.996 --> 08:18.415
Well, I believe the work we do here
is very important.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.542
Yeah.
But don't you want another crack at life?

08:21.293 --> 08:22.836
God, I miss drinking.

08:22.920 --> 08:25.214
I used to go so hard
with my girls back in Tampa.

08:25.297 --> 08:26.715
Wait, aren't you in HR?

08:26.798 --> 08:28.675
I have a tramp stamp
on the front and the back.

08:28.759 --> 08:31.053
We were crazy.
We stole a cruise ship one time.

08:31.136 --> 08:33.639
Look, HR, I don't know
if that's the right area for you--

08:33.722 --> 08:34.722
Figgy pudding.

08:35.224 --> 08:36.225
Wh-- I'm sorry, what?

08:36.308 --> 08:38.602
It says in your file
that you liked figgy pudding.

08:39.102 --> 08:40.437
Don't you wanna try it again?

08:40.520 --> 08:43.649
Don't you wanna go back on Earth
and do person stuff again?

08:43.732 --> 08:45.067
Yeah, I guess so.

08:45.567 --> 08:48.570
I mean, I died
before there was indoor plumbing, so I--

08:48.654 --> 08:51.657
Well,
it's been fun chatting and everything,

08:52.241 --> 08:55.077
but, there's, like,
a whole party going on, so…

08:55.160 --> 08:57.120
Okay, but I feel like
you started the conversation.

08:57.204 --> 09:00.749
Anyway, 46 seasons. Crazy.

09:02.793 --> 09:04.670
Just saying. Maybe it's time.

09:09.258 --> 09:10.509
Maybe she has a point.

09:11.301 --> 09:14.263
Is it time to find out if I'm

09:14.346 --> 09:18.475
Meant for more
Than just a Christmas morning feeling?

09:19.059 --> 09:22.604
I could go back to Earth
Retire, just peace out

09:22.688 --> 09:26.525
Another chance at the life
I've been dreaming about

09:30.445 --> 09:34.116
Maybe I buy
a quaint little house on a quiet street.

09:35.492 --> 09:38.078
I meet a nice gal,
and we get married and start a family.

09:38.745 --> 09:40.664
And then,
at the end of each day after work,

09:40.747 --> 09:46.628
we have a loving embrace and one of
those newfangled, modern mouth kisses.

09:47.629 --> 09:48.630
That'd be nice.

09:50.424 --> 09:53.594
Is it time to find out if I'm

09:53.677 --> 09:57.890
Ready to reach beyond
A Christmas morning feeling?

09:58.515 --> 10:02.019
To be human again, alive once more

10:02.102 --> 10:06.190
Take some swings
At the things I missed out on before

10:08.442 --> 10:09.860
And there's me in the backyard

10:09.943 --> 10:13.030
goofing around with my two kids
who share the same first initial.

10:13.113 --> 10:17.326
Little Rebecca and her brother,
Reggie or Robert or--

10:17.910 --> 10:22.289
Rar-- I don't know.
I'll think of a good "R" name.

10:26.001 --> 10:32.799
But what if I screw up my life again
Like I did the first time through

10:32.883 --> 10:36.178
Could I really be someone better

10:36.261 --> 10:40.182
Someone kinder, someone new?

10:40.766 --> 10:41.975
But no, no, no

10:42.059 --> 10:45.729
I've gotta make more
Of a difference here

10:45.812 --> 10:48.273
There's so much left to do

10:48.357 --> 10:51.985
With all the trolls
And a-holes out there

10:52.069 --> 10:55.322
Well, am I doing the world
A world of good?

10:55.405 --> 10:59.201
And have I given it my all?

10:59.701 --> 11:03.205
Or am I just full of it?

11:03.705 --> 11:06.583
Am I just full of sh--

11:06.667 --> 11:10.379
Hey. Come on now, potty mouth.

11:10.879 --> 11:13.382
Bit inappropriate for the day.

11:14.925 --> 11:16.552
I know, old friend.

11:18.220 --> 11:21.139
This is just your usual
post-haunt comedown, yeah?

11:21.223 --> 11:22.850
It's more than that, Jacob.

11:25.602 --> 11:26.770
Look at this place, mate.

11:28.981 --> 11:34.403
Every single one of them's a soul
that we've redeemed. Together.

11:36.613 --> 11:38.532
So, fret not, sunshine.

11:38.615 --> 11:41.410
For in two weeks' time,
we scout next season's perp,

11:41.493 --> 11:43.370
and I've seen the file on this one.

11:43.871 --> 11:46.582
-Manages a fancy hotel in Vancouver.
-Uh-huh?

11:46.665 --> 11:49.668
Right vile little bastard.
You're gonna love him.

11:49.751 --> 11:52.462
Just what you need
to get back up on that horse.

11:52.546 --> 11:55.966
So, come on now.
Stiff upper. Big-boy pants.

12:05.017 --> 12:10.314
Hey. Hey. Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey. You.

12:11.064 --> 12:12.774
-Walter.
-No one cares what your name is,

12:12.858 --> 12:15.736
and no one should have a mustache
on their lip and forehead.

12:15.819 --> 12:18.197
Why are you crossing
through my grand lobby?

12:18.697 --> 12:21.241
These Christmas Tree conventioners
pay top dollar to be here,

12:21.325 --> 12:23.702
so they don't have to look at
or think about people like you,

12:23.785 --> 12:25.370
you walking plunger.

12:26.205 --> 12:27.831
So, did I tell you?

12:27.915 --> 12:31.502
Abusive, stingy, self-centered.

12:32.211 --> 12:34.796
I like that he goes
against the Canadian stereotype.

12:34.880 --> 12:37.424
Yeah. It's weird to see a Canadian
without mittens.

12:37.508 --> 12:42.262
I mean, yeah.
He's an absolute turd in a suit. Right?

12:42.346 --> 12:44.890
But, I'm just wondering-- Hear me out.

12:44.973 --> 12:46.767
This guy-- And he's terrible--

12:48.560 --> 12:51.522
But if we change him, does he create
enough ripples to make a real difference?

12:51.605 --> 12:54.066
-That's all I'm saying.
-Make a real difference?

12:54.149 --> 12:56.944
Four-hundred people work for him.

12:57.027 --> 12:58.529
Bit sad, isn't it?

12:58.612 --> 13:01.532
Disgruntled, yeah?
Taking it out on their kids.

13:01.615 --> 13:04.076
Yes, Senator.
It's designed to be offensive.

13:05.410 --> 13:06.828
Outrage is a drug.

13:06.912 --> 13:10.082
Listen to me,
the second you tweet that word,

13:10.165 --> 13:13.460
CNN is no longer talking about
how you just boned the teachers' union.

13:13.544 --> 13:16.922
Trust me, Senator. Post it.

13:27.474 --> 13:28.976
I don't know.

13:30.018 --> 13:35.774
Our guest today
manages PR for AT&T and the NFL.

13:35.858 --> 13:38.777
He's helped senators, governors,
even presidents get elected.

13:38.861 --> 13:42.197
All due respect, Marty,
we're on our butts here.

13:42.698 --> 13:46.159
This trade group can't afford to hire
some fancy New York media consultant.

13:47.536 --> 13:48.620
Got that right.

13:49.621 --> 13:52.040
Here he is.
Let's give him a real good welcome.

13:52.124 --> 13:54.626
From the Briggs Media Group, Clint Briggs.

13:55.711 --> 13:58.505
Thank you, Marty. Always a pleasure.

13:58.589 --> 13:59.715
And it is true,

13:59.798 --> 14:03.051
I do charge comically enormous fees,

14:03.135 --> 14:05.888
which will probably bankrupt
your entire organization,

14:05.971 --> 14:07.848
but, you know, last week,

14:07.931 --> 14:12.394
over 300 million families
took down their Christmas trees.

14:12.477 --> 14:17.608
Eighty-one percent of which were fake,
plastic trees.

14:18.192 --> 14:19.026
Yeah.

14:19.109 --> 14:22.654
I don't know why you're acting surprised.
I hit one button on Amazon,

14:23.280 --> 14:26.825
and a shiny, new tree is on my porch
by the end of the afternoon.

14:26.909 --> 14:28.493
Easy-peasy.

14:29.203 --> 14:34.333
Yeah. People,
they used to insist on authenticity.

14:34.416 --> 14:37.127
Have people changed?
Now, that's the good news.

14:37.711 --> 14:41.381
Now, people never change.
But you know something?

14:43.217 --> 14:47.387
Real trees are trending downward.
Your sales continue slipping.

14:47.888 --> 14:52.768
They destroyed your bottom lines
With plastic pines and same-day shipping

14:54.144 --> 14:56.021
Well, you've got the better product.

14:56.522 --> 15:01.527
But if you wanna win
You gotta study human nature

15:02.361 --> 15:06.490
All those interested, lean in

15:08.742 --> 15:11.453
People are, one, lazy

15:11.537 --> 15:13.539
We only care about ourselves

15:14.122 --> 15:17.543
Your competition knows this
So their crap flies off the shelves

15:17.626 --> 15:22.631
But we're also, two, desperate
To feel good and smart and right

15:23.215 --> 15:27.261
And that's what you have to harness
If you wanna win this fight

15:27.344 --> 15:31.682
See, what you're really selling
Is the way things ought to be

15:31.765 --> 15:36.144
So your pitch becomes compelling
Selling more than just a tree

15:36.228 --> 15:40.858
It's a symbol of your values
It's your ethics and your cause

15:40.941 --> 15:43.777
You can either be fake
Like the trees they make

15:43.861 --> 15:47.656
Or take a stand for Santa Claus

15:47.739 --> 15:52.077
We're bringing back Christmas
We're bringing back cheer

15:52.160 --> 15:54.955
We're bringing back cozy nights
Those twinkly lights

15:55.038 --> 15:56.582
The glow of yesteryear

15:56.665 --> 16:00.961
Now, it's some slight manipulation
But it's what we've gotta do

16:01.044 --> 16:06.175
See, we need some confrontation
Or your message won't get through

16:06.884 --> 16:12.264
We're bringing back decency
We're bringing back Christmas

16:12.347 --> 16:16.143
And that means the piney scent
Of a real authentic tree

16:17.227 --> 16:19.313
They're literally eating out of his hand.

16:19.396 --> 16:24.193
It would be, sure, simple
To boost your market share

16:24.276 --> 16:28.614
We'd rebrand you as nostalgic
Tell your customers you care

16:28.697 --> 16:33.327
But the world is, what? Tribal
So if you want your sales to soar

16:33.410 --> 16:37.831
It's not enough for folks to love you
They gotta hate your rivals more

16:37.915 --> 16:42.211
As an expert my advice is
Feed that hate, 'cause hate is strong

16:42.294 --> 16:46.673
Folks will gladly pay your prices
To prove those Christmas-killers wrong

16:49.176 --> 16:50.552
We're bringing back Christmas

16:50.636 --> 16:53.472
-And all the joy that we've lost
-We're bringing it back

16:53.555 --> 16:56.183
Give me some peace on Earth
A virgin birth

16:56.266 --> 16:57.851
And grandpa getting sauced

16:57.935 --> 16:58.852
Wow!

16:58.936 --> 17:02.981
Every Facebook-loving boomer
Wants to fight a culture war

17:03.065 --> 17:06.984
So tell your core consumer
What the hell they're fighting for

17:08.069 --> 17:11.365
A fight for morality
A fight for morality

17:11.448 --> 17:13.617
We're bringing back Christmas

17:13.700 --> 17:17.329
And it's not coming back
With some manufactured tree

17:17.412 --> 17:19.248
I want a complete breakdown on him.

17:19.330 --> 17:22.125
I'm talking a living tree
in your living room.

17:22.626 --> 17:25.753
As I reach up to place the angel on top,

17:25.838 --> 17:31.385
I look out my window and I see
my neighbor, Doug, across the street,

17:31.468 --> 17:34.304
snapping together his artificial tree.

17:34.388 --> 17:37.933
He's like the perfect combination
of Mussolini and Seacrest.

17:38.517 --> 17:42.437
Easy-peasy, poor, lazy, deplorable Doug,

17:42.521 --> 17:47.818
who cares more about convenience than
the happiness and respect of his town,

17:48.318 --> 17:51.071
of his country, of our sacred holiday!

17:51.154 --> 17:53.323
Clint Briggs.
Grew up in Saint Paul, Minnesota.

17:53.407 --> 17:55.617
Middle child of three to a single mother.

17:55.701 --> 17:58.078
His older sister, Carrie,
passed away five years ago.

17:58.161 --> 18:01.248
Her daughter, Wren, is now being raised
by Clint's younger brother, Owen.

18:01.331 --> 18:04.501
Clint's company specializes
in creating controversy, conflict,

18:04.585 --> 18:07.546
and disinformation
for the benefit of his clients worldwide.

18:08.714 --> 18:11.800
Oh, my God. He's perfect.

18:12.676 --> 18:18.223
It's not enough to want it.
You gotta get mad. You have to fight.

18:18.307 --> 18:21.643
You have to fight for the traditions
we hold dear.

18:21.727 --> 18:23.103
So persuasive.

18:24.104 --> 18:27.482
Kinda makes you wanna push
an old lady down a flight of stairs.

18:27.566 --> 18:30.444
I'm talking nativities
And sweet baby Jeez

18:30.527 --> 18:32.863
Fat honey hams, Mariah Carey jams

18:32.946 --> 18:35.282
Feliz Navidad and the birth of our God

18:35.365 --> 18:38.702
Gathered 'round with our families

18:38.785 --> 18:42.998
We're bringing back Christmas
We're bringing back Christmas

18:43.624 --> 18:45.626
Plus a ton of cash

18:45.709 --> 18:49.213
From some good old-fashioned trees

18:49.296 --> 18:50.964
The cozy glow of yesteryear

18:51.048 --> 18:53.050
All those twinkly lights
And all the cheer

18:53.133 --> 18:55.677
We're bringing back Christmas
We're bringing back Christmas

18:58.388 --> 18:59.765
Thank you.

19:06.939 --> 19:07.814
Yeah!

19:07.898 --> 19:09.024
Yes!

19:09.608 --> 19:10.692
That's our man.

19:11.985 --> 19:14.363
I'm sorry, this is not our man.

19:14.446 --> 19:17.157
Wait. What? Hold on. Why not?

19:17.241 --> 19:20.452
Jacob, the guy causes division for a job.

19:21.036 --> 19:22.955
-And he's--
-Insanely hot.

19:24.581 --> 19:26.333
Is that not what you were gonna say?

19:28.418 --> 19:29.837
What? I've been dead for 40 years,

19:29.920 --> 19:32.005
and I'm not made of wood.
The man's attractive.

19:32.089 --> 19:34.091
-No, he's smoking hot.
-Smoking hot.

19:34.174 --> 19:37.261
And more importantly,
he's got his hands all over everything.

19:37.344 --> 19:38.679
Yeah. I wish.

19:39.721 --> 19:41.390
-Maude, are you texting HR?
-No.

19:42.057 --> 19:45.644
Jacob, I'm telling you. He could be
our greatest haunt ever. The whale.

19:46.228 --> 19:48.355
If we change him, imagine the ripples.

19:56.071 --> 19:57.072
Great.

19:58.031 --> 20:00.701
That is a flagrant breach
of established protocol.

20:00.784 --> 20:03.495
So, we're stuck with creepy,
convention boss guy, then?

20:03.579 --> 20:05.747
Yep. No hot-girl Christmas for you.

20:05.831 --> 20:07.207
Okay. Hang on.

20:08.125 --> 20:10.836
He's not an unredeemable
because he drowns puppies.

20:10.919 --> 20:14.298
He's only stamped because he's
"dogmatically committed to the belief

20:14.381 --> 20:15.841
that people never change."

20:15.924 --> 20:18.218
"Never change"?
Now I do want a piece of this guy.

20:18.302 --> 20:21.013
Jacob, I'm telling you.
I know what makes this guy tick.

20:21.096 --> 20:23.348
We won't fail. Come on.
I can take this guy.

20:24.892 --> 20:27.895
Besides, you know it's been done before.

20:27.978 --> 20:32.441
Once. Barely.
And you know that was different.

20:32.524 --> 20:34.693
-What did he say?
-But with the state the world is in now,

20:34.776 --> 20:38.655
I'm not about to risk a whole year
of ripples on a lost cause. I'm sorry.

20:38.739 --> 20:41.200
We go with the rat-bastard hotel manager.

20:42.534 --> 20:46.246
In that case, I would like to collect
my retirement package.

20:47.789 --> 20:48.957
He said retire.

20:49.041 --> 20:52.377
-Wait, you can't retire.
-Now, settle down, spirits.

20:53.378 --> 20:55.797
-He's bluffing.
-Sorry, did you say retire?

20:55.881 --> 20:57.299
Do I look like I'm bluffing?

20:59.218 --> 21:01.053
Actually, you do. Yes.

21:03.430 --> 21:04.431
All right, then.

21:11.647 --> 21:14.107
All you have to do is take it
and you're retired.

21:14.983 --> 21:15.984
Back on Earth.

21:16.068 --> 21:20.197
Living, breathing and offering opinions
on things you know nothing about.

21:20.697 --> 21:22.699
Right. Earth.

21:27.037 --> 21:29.206
You know what?
We don't have to do this right now.

21:29.289 --> 21:32.709
There is no shame in your dedication
to the betterment of mankind.

21:32.793 --> 21:35.254
-Now, if you'll excuse me.
-Jacob, please.

21:35.337 --> 21:37.965
I can't explain it,
but if I could just change this guy,

21:38.048 --> 21:40.592
-maybe I'll--
-What? Maybe you'll what?

21:41.969 --> 21:44.972
Oh, no. No. There's no need
for a whole big number here. No.

21:45.055 --> 21:48.308
No spotlight. Gary, kill the spot--

21:48.392 --> 21:49.601
Every day I wake up

21:49.685 --> 21:52.980
With a single dream
Running through my head

21:53.063 --> 21:55.732
Look, I have another meeting
I'm actually late for.

21:55.816 --> 21:59.194
To throw a tiny stone
Into a mighty stream

21:59.278 --> 22:01.488
And watch the ripples as they spread

22:01.572 --> 22:04.449
Redeeming an unredeemable
is nearly impossible.

22:05.742 --> 22:11.748
But if you'll promise to stop singing,
you can have your perp.

22:13.792 --> 22:17.254
Really? Great. Thank you.
That's quite reasonable.

22:18.380 --> 22:20.716
Thanks, Gary. We're good.
You were right on the cue.

22:21.258 --> 22:23.260
Guys, he said yes. Let's get to work.

22:23.343 --> 22:24.469
Yes!

22:24.553 --> 22:26.388
Do you wanna hear the rest of my song?

22:28.056 --> 22:32.811
And so it begins.
A full year of research and preparation.

22:37.065 --> 22:41.862
Painstakingly recreating
one man's past, present and future.

22:45.240 --> 22:48.035
Why do we work so hard?
We do it for the ripples.

22:50.329 --> 22:51.705
Damn!

22:51.788 --> 22:53.248
See, it's a documented fact

22:53.332 --> 22:56.627
that one person's kindness
can have a ripple effect.

22:57.753 --> 22:59.671
Spreading goodwill like a pandemic--

22:59.755 --> 23:01.215
No. Scratch that. Sorry.

23:01.340 --> 23:02.508
You know, like--

23:02.591 --> 23:07.179
You know when people at a football stadium
do the wave? Like that. More like that.

23:11.850 --> 23:16.355
Now, finally,
I have a perp with global reach.

23:20.442 --> 23:22.694
If we can redeem this unredeemable,

23:24.029 --> 23:26.657
imagine just how far
these ripples could go.

23:29.785 --> 23:32.079
Briggs Media Group. One moment please.

23:32.162 --> 23:35.999
Watch how far the ripples go

23:36.083 --> 23:39.044
Watch how far the ripples go

23:39.127 --> 23:40.546
Go

23:40.629 --> 23:45.425
Ripple
Look how far the ripples go

23:47.052 --> 23:49.763
Okay. The Billie Eilish-
Ed Sheeran beef has been approved

23:49.847 --> 23:51.473
by management on both sides.

23:52.099 --> 23:55.769
Ed will post the insensitive comment
on Tuesday and then apologize on Sunday.

23:55.853 --> 23:59.231
Okay, let's push the apology back
to the day of the VMAs to maximize buzz.

24:00.482 --> 24:01.525
And your niece is here.

24:02.025 --> 24:05.904
Apparently, she'd like your help with
something, but Owen didn't say what it is.

24:06.530 --> 24:07.823
She get the phone I sent?

24:08.407 --> 24:09.408
Hoverboard?

24:10.075 --> 24:12.035
It's just--
I got a really busy day going here.

24:12.911 --> 24:13.996
No problem.

24:14.079 --> 24:16.790
I'll just go tell your late sister's
only kid you're too busy.

24:18.208 --> 24:20.627
Top-notch guilt trip, Kimberly.

24:20.711 --> 24:23.672
The way you emphasize "late."
Proud of you.

24:25.632 --> 24:27.009
So, Uncle Clint,

24:27.092 --> 24:31.597
I was thinking that maybe I would run
for Student Council President.

24:34.349 --> 24:38.395
So, maybe you could help me. Something.

24:38.478 --> 24:41.690
Wow. That's-- I mean, you know, that
requires someone who's very--

24:42.399 --> 24:46.153
You've always struck me as someone who's
more of an inside-voice type of person.

24:46.236 --> 24:49.656
So, what makes you want to run
for Student Council President?

24:51.200 --> 24:53.744
-Go ahead.
-Well, I think I can make the school

24:53.827 --> 24:54.995
-way better…
-100%.

24:55.078 --> 24:56.079
…if they pick me.

24:57.080 --> 24:58.624
-But they probably won't.
-Probably not.

24:58.707 --> 25:01.835
-'Cause Josh Hubbins is running, so…
-Josh Hubbins?

25:02.628 --> 25:03.754
Jo-- He sounds like a,

25:03.837 --> 25:05.380
-you know, a legend at…
-Yeah.

25:05.464 --> 25:06.507
…whatever school you go to.

25:07.257 --> 25:09.676
Never mind. It was a stupid idea.
I'm sorry.

25:09.760 --> 25:10.928
I shouldn't have bothered you.

25:11.011 --> 25:12.888
It's all right.
I have bad ideas sometimes.

25:12.971 --> 25:16.558
Clint, you promised Carrie if Wren
ever needed anything, you would help her.

25:16.642 --> 25:18.936
-You remember that?
-Yes. Yes, I remember. I…

25:25.442 --> 25:27.569
You've already won. You already won.

25:27.653 --> 25:31.198
Hey. Come here. Sit. Sit, please.

25:31.281 --> 25:34.284
You got this in the bag,
but you're gonna get your hands dirty.

25:34.368 --> 25:36.662
You're gonna say and do things
that you will not be proud of.

25:36.745 --> 25:37.746
Hey, wait a minute, Clint--

25:37.829 --> 25:40.666
Please hold your indignation,
'cause it's gonna get worse.

25:40.749 --> 25:44.002
So, this Josh Hubbins,
what are his grades like?

25:44.086 --> 25:45.420
He gets straight A's.

25:46.004 --> 25:47.631
-So do I.
-Yeah. That's good for him,

25:47.714 --> 25:49.800
-but for you, I prefer C's.
-She's never gotten less than--

25:49.883 --> 25:52.135
I would love a D in there,
so you're gonna tank your midterms,

25:52.219 --> 25:54.304
you're gonna bank some detentions,
and boom.

25:54.388 --> 25:57.516
You're a woman of the people.
We cast Josh as a snot-nosed elite.

25:57.599 --> 25:58.433
You get?

25:58.517 --> 26:01.395
I don't know about this,
'cause he's actually super nice.

26:01.478 --> 26:04.940
-Yeah, he's a great kid, really.
-Okay. I will put you over my knee.

26:05.023 --> 26:07.067
And his parents have their own non-profit.

26:07.150 --> 26:09.194
Trust me, he's hiding something.
Everybody is.

26:09.278 --> 26:12.155
Kimberly's gonna do some oppo research.
That means digging up dirt.

26:12.239 --> 26:17.953
And Kimberly is the best.
She is a stone-cold killer.

26:18.495 --> 26:20.914
Opposition research on an eighth-grader?

26:21.540 --> 26:22.541
Sure.

26:23.083 --> 26:25.711
-Okay.
-You hungry? You want a juice box?

26:25.794 --> 26:27.212
-I'm okay.
-Want a Negroni?

26:27.296 --> 26:29.381
You know what? I'm just gonna stay on her,

26:29.464 --> 26:33.218
just in case this turns into an important
story thread that we may wanna follow.

26:33.302 --> 26:34.887
Well, okay.

26:34.970 --> 26:37.890
Yeah, I'm gonna stay and watch him
put ponytail man over his knee.

26:40.100 --> 26:41.101
Hey, Mom.

26:41.185 --> 26:45.981
Boy, we have similar jobs, don't we?
Digging up dirt on people.

26:47.858 --> 26:49.234
What do we have here?

26:49.735 --> 26:53.989
When your parents make you eat Christmas
dinner with homeless people. Gross.

26:54.072 --> 26:56.992
Oh, Josh. What did you post?

26:57.951 --> 27:01.747
You're sunk, kiddo. You are so sunk.

27:05.292 --> 27:07.794
I'm doing oppo research on a child.

27:15.844 --> 27:19.431
The big corner office
The 12-person team

27:19.515 --> 27:23.101
A slick leather chair
The American Dream

27:23.185 --> 27:26.563
My mom used to clean
Ritzy places like these

27:26.647 --> 27:31.276
With their overpriced art
And their walls of degrees

27:31.818 --> 27:35.447
Well, now it's all mine
With my name on the door

27:35.531 --> 27:39.368
A big, fancy desk on the 38th floor

27:39.451 --> 27:45.249
Look at the girl who did right
At the height of a hard-won career

27:46.500 --> 27:50.379
What could surpass
Giant windows of glass

27:50.462 --> 27:52.422
Framing miles of blue

27:53.090 --> 27:56.385
That's the view from here

27:58.929 --> 28:02.266
That's the view from here

28:03.058 --> 28:06.562
They say, "Climb the ladder
No matter the cost"

28:07.062 --> 28:10.566
But nobody tells you
How much can get lost

28:10.649 --> 28:14.027
That decent and hopeful
Young woman you were

28:14.111 --> 28:17.197
Well, you wake up one day
And you wonder

28:17.865 --> 28:19.741
"What happened to her?"

28:20.951 --> 28:24.663
That woman was made
To see good in each heart

28:24.746 --> 28:28.250
But now she gets paid
To pull people apart

28:28.876 --> 28:35.007
And, I mean, hey, look at me
MVP, employee of the year

28:35.966 --> 28:39.761
Well, maybe I guess
That this looks like success

28:39.845 --> 28:41.930
But it doesn't feel true

28:42.514 --> 28:45.809
That's the view from here

28:48.061 --> 28:51.356
That's the view from here

28:58.030 --> 29:01.450
I could keep doing oppo
Keep digging up dirt

29:01.950 --> 29:05.537
Pretend I don't care
When nice people get hurt

29:06.038 --> 29:09.374
Block out the guilt
That I'd have to ignore

29:09.458 --> 29:14.713
For a raise as I rise
To the 39th floor

29:18.217 --> 29:22.596
Or I can walk out this door
And defiantly quit

29:22.679 --> 29:26.058
There's a line you can't cross
And I think this is it

29:26.558 --> 29:30.020
Maybe I haven't lost sight
Of what's right

29:30.103 --> 29:33.815
No, it's perfectly clear

29:35.025 --> 29:37.528
-That was quick.
-Go ahead. Tell him how you feel.

29:38.737 --> 29:40.030
You found something good, didn't you?

29:40.113 --> 29:44.368
See, you can always tell by
the self-loathing expression on her face.

29:44.952 --> 29:47.704
-Well, actually…
-Yeah. Come on. You can do it.

29:47.788 --> 29:48.830
…I came here…

29:48.914 --> 29:51.583
To say you quit your job,
but you want ample severance.

29:52.668 --> 29:56.046
-…to say, I…
-Yeah.

29:56.129 --> 29:59.967
…found something that should do the trick.

30:00.050 --> 30:03.220
Yes, you did. Let's go see. Come on.

30:06.473 --> 30:10.853
At the end of the day
Words are easy to say

30:11.520 --> 30:14.481
But it looks like the walking away

30:14.565 --> 30:17.484
Is a little bit harder to do

30:19.069 --> 30:21.864
That's the view

30:23.574 --> 30:24.908
From here

30:37.296 --> 30:41.049
Well, Josh's family runs a Christmas Day
dinner at a homeless shelter.

30:41.133 --> 30:43.302
He'll be humblebragging
the crap out of that.

30:43.385 --> 30:48.473
But, two years ago, he posted
and quickly deleted this on TikTok.

30:48.557 --> 30:49.516
When your parents

30:49.600 --> 30:52.352
make you eat Christmas dinner
with homeless people. Gross.

30:54.605 --> 30:56.190
I am outraged.

30:56.273 --> 30:58.150
I told you Kimberly was the best.

30:58.233 --> 31:00.694
Once Josh is done trumpeting
his annual good deed, Wrenny,

31:00.777 --> 31:04.323
you post that video, start writing your
acceptance speech, and Bob's your uncle.

31:04.406 --> 31:06.491
-Actually, I'm your uncle, so…
-This is two years ago.

31:06.575 --> 31:09.494
-Time to go.
-He's a kid. He's in sixth grade.

31:09.578 --> 31:12.247
Wait, Clint, please. Can we just hang on
and talk about this for a second?

31:12.331 --> 31:15.626
We only get one elevator a day.
So, let's catch this one. Bye, guys.

31:16.502 --> 31:17.920
-Like ya.
-Do it again.

31:18.003 --> 31:19.254
Yeah.

31:22.841 --> 31:25.594
It's official. I'm a terrible person.

31:26.845 --> 31:28.180
No, you're not.

31:32.518 --> 31:33.519
Excuse me?

31:35.687 --> 31:38.065
What? Can she see you right now?

31:38.148 --> 31:39.441
Have we met?

31:40.108 --> 31:41.109
Can she see me?

31:41.610 --> 31:42.611
Hey!

31:44.154 --> 31:45.989
-This is crazy.
-I don't think so.

31:46.073 --> 31:47.074
No.

31:47.157 --> 31:50.035
Well, then how do you know
how terrible I may or may not be?

31:50.118 --> 31:51.578
Why can she see you?

31:51.662 --> 31:52.913
I don't know.

31:54.331 --> 31:56.834
Well, I've always been
a good judge of character.

31:56.917 --> 32:00.462
-It's kinda baked into my job.
-Do you work here?

32:00.546 --> 32:02.881
-We have to kill her now, right?
-No!

32:04.258 --> 32:06.385
I'm here on a project.

32:06.969 --> 32:08.345
-For Briggs?
-What are you doing?

32:08.428 --> 32:10.347
Well, it involves Mr. Briggs.

32:10.430 --> 32:12.891
Get out of this.
You're going to get us in trouble.

32:12.975 --> 32:14.268
Really? Which project?

32:14.351 --> 32:16.436
Make something up. Make something up.
Abort.

32:16.520 --> 32:19.731
-I'm The Ghost of Christmas Present.
-What are you doing?

32:21.066 --> 32:22.568
Yeah,
we'll be haunting him this Christmas,

32:22.651 --> 32:25.279
-in hopes we can change him into being…
-You got to be kidding me.

32:25.362 --> 32:27.155
…a more positive force for humanity.

32:28.991 --> 32:30.284
Clint?

32:31.368 --> 32:32.911
Clint. Yeah.

32:37.291 --> 32:38.292
I'm Kimberly.

32:52.681 --> 32:54.016
Roberto.

32:54.892 --> 32:56.351
C. Fishman.

32:56.435 --> 32:58.812
Pratt. Roberto C. Fishman Pratt.

33:00.480 --> 33:03.984
Well. Thanks for the laugh, Roberto.

33:04.693 --> 33:08.739
And the compliment.
I needed both of them right about now.

33:09.740 --> 33:11.074
Like the outfit.

33:12.409 --> 33:13.452
Thank you.

33:16.622 --> 33:20.584
You know, I think deep down, you wanted
her to see you because you're into her.

33:20.667 --> 33:22.085
I'm not into her.

33:22.628 --> 33:24.004
Roberto C. Fishman Pratt?

33:24.087 --> 33:26.757
-Okay, it's a bad name!
-It's too many names.

33:27.799 --> 33:29.218
And as if we didn't have enough

33:29.301 --> 33:30.511
to fight about at Christmas dinner,

33:30.594 --> 33:34.223
the kind of Christmas tree you have
is now a battle on social media.

33:34.973 --> 33:37.017
It is. Lots of anger on both sides.

33:37.100 --> 33:40.812
Apparently, if you have a real tree,
you're a judgmental elitist hipster.

33:42.105 --> 33:43.190
But if you have a fake tree,

33:43.273 --> 33:46.527
you're an enemy of Santa Claus,
Jesus, and Mariah Carey. And that's--

33:47.694 --> 33:49.863
You don't wanna
bring out Mariah's bad side.

33:51.573 --> 33:54.451
Hey. I'm watching it right now.

33:55.118 --> 33:57.746
Yeah.
Let's have our influencers hit it hard.

33:57.829 --> 34:00.749
#ChristmasTreeWar. And remind Wren--

34:00.832 --> 34:02.376
Rafi, these are amazing.

34:02.459 --> 34:04.169
Remind Wren not to post the video
of the kid

34:04.253 --> 34:05.963
until after he posts
from the homeless shelter--

34:06.046 --> 34:07.047
Holy bejeebus.

34:09.049 --> 34:10.342
The suit is amazing.

34:11.217 --> 34:12.594
Wow, Beth.

34:21.853 --> 34:22.855
Are you guys…

34:26.190 --> 34:27.192
Beth?

34:47.212 --> 34:50.090
Oh, damn. That's not good.

34:51.175 --> 34:53.467
All right,
whoever's filming me, I'm impressed.

34:57.347 --> 34:58.515
Oh, Jesus!

34:59.224 --> 35:05.063
This chain I forged in life
is girded of my own free will.

35:05.564 --> 35:08.942
Link by link
with each soul I made to suffer.

35:09.026 --> 35:11.987
Very convincing. Okay, who--

35:15.449 --> 35:16.909
Oh, f--

35:16.992 --> 35:20.078
Ye shall find no sleep tonight

35:20.162 --> 35:21.538
Okay, I'm dreaming.

35:21.622 --> 35:25.083
No, this is not a dream

35:25.167 --> 35:26.460
God, you're ugly.

35:26.543 --> 35:30.088
Many wrongs have ye to right

35:30.172 --> 35:34.259
Dark deeds ye must redeem

35:34.343 --> 35:37.095
You keep singing, I'm gonna stand up.

35:37.179 --> 35:41.391
Your past, your present
And your future

35:41.475 --> 35:43.685
Ye shall soon behold

35:43.769 --> 35:45.312
This is very, very weird.

35:45.395 --> 35:49.858
The story of your life

35:49.942 --> 35:52.194
Shall now

35:52.778 --> 35:56.823
Unfold

36:00.077 --> 36:01.495
Feel my chain!

36:02.579 --> 36:03.580
Can I not?

36:07.000 --> 36:11.588
The story of your life
The truth you're scared to hear

36:11.672 --> 36:12.673
I--

36:12.756 --> 36:16.677
The story of your life
A tale of reckoning and fear

36:16.760 --> 36:19.763
I just have one thing you really need to--

36:19.847 --> 36:21.807
I'm so sorry.

36:21.890 --> 36:24.101
I'm stuck on the first thing there.

36:24.184 --> 36:26.103
The-- You said, "Past, present, future."

36:27.271 --> 36:29.815
Like A Christmas Carol? The Dickens story?

36:29.898 --> 36:31.525
The Bill Murray movie
with Bobcat Goldthwait?

36:31.608 --> 36:34.862
Yes. Like the Dickens book
and the Bill Murray movie

36:34.945 --> 36:36.905
and every other adaptation
nobody asked for.

36:36.989 --> 36:39.950
Now, please, if you would just
let me get this out. Sit.

36:40.033 --> 36:41.034
Here?

36:41.702 --> 36:42.703
Okay.

36:47.666 --> 36:50.002
You might rewrite

36:50.085 --> 36:53.839
The story of your life

36:54.339 --> 36:56.049
Before it's all too late

36:58.385 --> 36:59.636
What is it?

36:59.720 --> 37:01.972
Again, I'm so sorry.

37:02.639 --> 37:04.474
So, out of all the people on the planet--

37:04.558 --> 37:09.021
murderers, racists,
people who do gender-reveal parties--

37:09.104 --> 37:10.689
I'm the guy you're gonna haunt?

37:10.772 --> 37:12.858
If you would shut up and let me finish,
you might understand--

37:12.941 --> 37:14.818
-Yes, sir.
-You know what?

37:15.319 --> 37:17.070
Forget it. It's not worth the trouble.

37:17.154 --> 37:18.655
Three ghosts coming to save you.

37:18.739 --> 37:21.783
Bit more consideration for them
than you did for me maybe, yeah?

37:21.867 --> 37:23.410
-Noted.
-Good. All right, then. Cheers.

37:32.920 --> 37:37.758
I told you.
The guy is a level 20 pain in the ass.

37:40.594 --> 37:41.595
You got this.

37:41.678 --> 37:43.263
Yeah. No sweat.

37:43.347 --> 37:45.098
All right, team, last looks. I'm going in.

37:45.182 --> 37:47.851
Go get 'em, girl. Knock 'em dead.

37:59.905 --> 38:01.490
Oh, come on.

38:24.596 --> 38:26.056
Hello, Mr. Briggs.

38:26.139 --> 38:29.351
I'm The Ghost of Christmas Past.
Your past.

38:30.060 --> 38:32.479
Hi. Wow.

38:32.980 --> 38:36.400
Good. You're not what I was expecting.

38:36.483 --> 38:38.318
No? How so?

38:38.402 --> 38:39.987
I mean, you're lovely.

38:40.070 --> 38:41.905
Yeah, I know.

38:43.031 --> 38:48.120
-But still, it is nice to hear it.
-I bet.

38:48.954 --> 38:53.041
Thank you. But we should just--
We should go.

38:53.125 --> 38:56.086
I just-- If you don't mind--
Would you mind if I have a quick shower?

38:56.170 --> 38:58.589
-I just would love to freshen up a skosh--
-Shower? Right now?

38:58.672 --> 39:01.341
The last ghost was a little musky,
and I touched his chain.

39:02.676 --> 39:08.599
Yeah. Then definitely.
You should shower if you're feeling dirty.

39:09.183 --> 39:11.226
-Thank you. Okay.
-Well, no.

39:11.310 --> 39:12.895
I mean, wait. No.

39:12.978 --> 39:16.106
We should just--
We have to go. There's a lot to see.

39:16.190 --> 39:17.232
Right. Of course. Yeah.

39:18.358 --> 39:20.861
Soft. Jinx.

39:21.653 --> 39:22.654
Owe me a beer.

39:25.073 --> 39:27.117
-Yeah. We should go.
-Yeah.

39:34.583 --> 39:35.751
Hey, Chief.

39:36.251 --> 39:38.003
-You got a sec?
-Yeah. What's up?

39:38.086 --> 39:41.548
Look, man. I'm tired
of being just the guy who points at stuff.

39:41.632 --> 39:45.469
Right. Well, look, hey,
I wouldn't underestimate the pointing.

39:45.552 --> 39:46.845
-Yeah.
-I mean, the way you do it,

39:46.929 --> 39:48.597
it's chilling. Hit me with it again.

39:49.306 --> 39:50.432
Boom!

39:50.516 --> 39:52.601
Okay. You're very good at it.

39:52.684 --> 39:56.313
Yeah, I appreciate that, but I've got
some catchphrases I wanna try out.

39:56.396 --> 39:57.773
Check these out.

39:57.856 --> 40:01.485
"Welcome to the bone zone."
"Bone appétit."

40:02.110 --> 40:05.239
Or my favorite,
"You've been Christmas Caroled, bitch."

40:05.322 --> 40:06.532
I don't know what to say.

40:07.032 --> 40:09.576
Every year during the haunt,
you try to talk and nothing comes out.

40:09.660 --> 40:11.745
Yeah, and why is that? It's just not--

40:11.828 --> 40:14.331
Dude, it's not up to him.
He doesn't make the rules.

40:14.414 --> 40:17.000
Excuse me. Why aren't you on the haunt?

40:17.084 --> 40:20.546
Yeah. Well, get a load of this.

40:20.629 --> 40:21.672
Yeah, I'm waiting.

40:21.755 --> 40:24.383
So, flying him back
to his childhood in Minneapolis.

40:24.466 --> 40:26.176
-Uh-huh.
-And he's holding my hand.

40:26.260 --> 40:29.304
And he can't help himself,
he starts flirting with me.

40:29.388 --> 40:32.349
One thing led to another, and you know.

40:33.433 --> 40:35.018
Please tell me you're kidding.

40:35.102 --> 40:37.187
-I am…
-Okay.

40:37.271 --> 40:38.146
…not kidding.

40:38.230 --> 40:39.398
-What?
-I know.

40:39.481 --> 40:42.442
-Here we go.
-It was unprofessional, but, you know,

40:42.526 --> 40:45.487
it's been a very long time since
anyone's tried to get up in my beeswax.

40:45.571 --> 40:48.156
So, Mama did something for herself
for a change.

40:48.240 --> 40:51.660
Okay. Well, did Mama consider the stakes?
He's an unredeemable!

40:51.743 --> 40:53.370
He redeemed himself a little bit.

40:53.453 --> 40:55.247
-Good for you!
-Just saying.

40:55.789 --> 40:58.125
Okay. Now I feel like he's judging me.

40:59.001 --> 41:00.794
No, I'm not judging you.

41:00.878 --> 41:04.214
I don't even know what to think.
Hold on. Where is he now?

41:04.298 --> 41:07.843
He's fine. He's in his
childhood bedroom in the '80s.

41:07.926 --> 41:09.178
We'll talk about this later.

41:09.261 --> 41:11.805
I need you to get back out there
and take him through his past.

41:11.889 --> 41:15.350
Right. Yes, okay. But, hey,
could you do it? Cover my shift?

41:15.434 --> 41:19.313
I mean, I feel like it's gonna
be awkward. He's really into me.

41:29.823 --> 41:30.824
All right.

41:30.908 --> 41:33.911
Don't you come back
with the same story she did.

41:46.590 --> 41:48.634
My Alex P. Keaton action figure.

41:49.593 --> 41:52.679
Hey, ghost girl.

41:53.347 --> 41:55.224
When I was a kid, this thing--

41:57.059 --> 41:58.477
Hello, Mr. Briggs.

41:58.560 --> 42:02.814
Hello. Where's the other one?
Are you also a--

42:05.108 --> 42:10.739
Wow. This dream makes zero sense.

42:10.822 --> 42:12.407
This is not a dream, Mr. Briggs.

42:12.491 --> 42:14.701
-And can you stop touching my face?
-For sure.

42:14.785 --> 42:16.119
I'm your Ghost of Christmas Present.

42:16.203 --> 42:19.206
Present? What are you doing in my past?

42:19.289 --> 42:20.707
See? Dream.

42:21.500 --> 42:24.711
Well, your haunt got off
to a bit of a "humpy" start.

42:24.795 --> 42:26.088
Yes, it did.

42:27.172 --> 42:30.133
So, I will be handling both past
and present this evening.

42:30.217 --> 42:31.385
-Of course.
-This isn't my usual gig,

42:31.468 --> 42:33.804
so I just need to get a lay of the land,
if you don't mind?

42:33.887 --> 42:35.264
Sure.

42:36.765 --> 42:39.268
Yeah. This should do. Okay.

42:40.477 --> 42:41.979
Hey, I'm haunting you.

42:42.062 --> 42:46.066
You can't just run away from me
when I'm haunting you. Hello?

42:47.401 --> 42:48.861
-Hey, hotshot…
-Geez.

42:49.528 --> 42:51.697
…you know, it's totally understandable
if you're scared

42:51.780 --> 42:53.782
that you won't be able
to defend your choices.

42:55.284 --> 43:00.080
-Look, Colonel Sanders…
-I haunted him, yes.

43:00.664 --> 43:03.292
The proper way
to do that technique is, you--

43:06.670 --> 43:09.298
Am I right? I said, am I right?

43:10.007 --> 43:11.633
-Carrie.
-Carrie!

43:11.717 --> 43:14.428
-Mom said we can open one present tonight.
-Cool.

43:14.511 --> 43:16.722
Let's start with that green one.

43:18.599 --> 43:19.933
You got me a puppy?

43:20.017 --> 43:22.686
You've only been asking me for a puppy
for about, what, a thousand years?

43:22.769 --> 43:23.812
Where is he?

43:24.563 --> 43:25.898
He's sleeping in the kitchen.

43:25.981 --> 43:28.901
-Sparky?
-Sparky?

43:29.526 --> 43:31.028
Oh, Clinty, wait till you see him.

43:31.111 --> 43:35.032
He's got the most adorable
little white paws and-- Oh, my God.

43:35.115 --> 43:37.951
How many times have I told you to close
this kitchen door when you come back in?

43:38.035 --> 43:41.371
If it doesn't click when you close it,
then it lets all the heat out,

43:41.455 --> 43:44.082
and apparently,
adorable little puppies too.

43:44.166 --> 43:46.376
Oh, geez, this is a Christmas tragedy.

43:46.460 --> 43:48.754
Clint, no, she's lying.

43:48.837 --> 43:50.088
There is no puppy.

43:50.172 --> 43:53.050
She got you a dog dish
to make you think that there was a puppy.

43:53.759 --> 43:54.760
That's ridiculous.

43:54.843 --> 43:56.428
Then why aren't we looking for it?

43:56.512 --> 43:59.431
You know, if you spent a nickel on it,
we would be out looking all night.

43:59.515 --> 44:01.391
That is it.

44:02.351 --> 44:04.269
You're ruining Christmas!

44:05.896 --> 44:07.940
Yeah, you keep on running, missy.

44:08.899 --> 44:10.234
Hey, where do you think you're going?

44:10.817 --> 44:14.071
Sparky?

44:14.154 --> 44:15.489
I see it now.

44:18.200 --> 44:20.410
-Sparky?
-I see the--

44:21.161 --> 44:22.162
I see the--

44:22.829 --> 44:28.210
the chain of events that led me to be
the monster that I am.

44:30.546 --> 44:33.215
-Sorry. That was too much.
-You're faking. Very nice.

44:33.298 --> 44:38.011
What do you expect when you misread
the situation so egregiously?

44:38.095 --> 44:41.723
That was the single best Christmas gift
that she or anyone else has ever given me.

44:41.807 --> 44:44.768
Hold on. A lie about a nonexistent puppy?

44:44.852 --> 44:45.769
No.

44:45.853 --> 44:49.940
The solid-gold lesson that people will
believe anything if they wanna believe it.

44:50.023 --> 44:52.025
I wanted a puppy so bad

44:52.109 --> 44:55.362
that it was better to believe
I had a lost dog than no dog at all.

44:55.445 --> 44:59.491
That lesson made me so rich,
I could buy a million puppies.

44:59.575 --> 45:03.203
Plus I never left the door open again,
so you know, win-win.

45:03.287 --> 45:04.538
Okay, smarty-pants.

45:08.292 --> 45:09.543
-Thank you.
-No.

45:10.669 --> 45:14.173
-That's not for you. It's for her.
-Who's her?

45:15.424 --> 45:20.053
Yeah, I heard of this.
It's where people use that--

45:20.137 --> 45:22.764
-that pound or hashy thing, right?
-Yeah. Yep, I'm telling you,

45:22.848 --> 45:25.559
a year from now,
this is gonna be on all of your phones.

45:25.642 --> 45:26.643
I don't know.

45:26.727 --> 45:29.479
Do people really wanna talk about
everything they've ever done

45:29.563 --> 45:32.524
-with every idiot they've ever met?
-Yes. Yes, they do, new girl.

45:32.608 --> 45:34.067
-They really do.
-Really? It's Nora.

45:35.152 --> 45:38.906
Nora. Yes, every thought, every meal.

45:38.989 --> 45:40.324
Boy, that Nora was a keeper.

45:41.533 --> 45:42.868
Wonder how it all works out with her.

45:45.662 --> 45:48.707
Ho, ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas.

45:49.374 --> 45:50.709
Ho, ho, ho.

45:51.293 --> 45:53.086
Good. Christmas shopping.

45:53.170 --> 45:54.630
-Hey, that's Clint right there.
-Hey, Clint.

45:54.713 --> 45:56.298
-Hi, Nora.
-Hi.

45:56.381 --> 45:57.674
Oh, my God, I love your boots.

45:58.800 --> 45:59.885
-Hey
-Hey, Owen.

45:59.968 --> 46:02.763
I'm sorry.
The level of detail is astounding.

46:04.223 --> 46:05.224
Is that a Sephora?

46:07.226 --> 46:09.019
-Yeah.
-Those didn't exist.

46:09.102 --> 46:11.021
Good eye. Yeah, that wasn't here.

46:11.647 --> 46:12.981
We have a deal with them.

46:13.065 --> 46:15.025
There's my baby boy.

46:15.108 --> 46:16.443
Mom invited herself, so…

46:16.527 --> 46:17.861
-Here we--
-Hi, hon.

46:18.362 --> 46:20.280
Good, you're drunk.
Well, it's 8 a.m. somewhere.

46:20.364 --> 46:21.740
God, I used to love this mall.

46:21.823 --> 46:22.824
Hey.

46:23.325 --> 46:25.244
And I see you brought
this one again. Very lovely.

46:25.327 --> 46:27.704
-It's nice to see you, Wendy.
-Yeah, I'll bet it is.

46:27.788 --> 46:29.998
Hey,
if anyone's looking for a gift for me…

46:30.082 --> 46:31.500
What?

46:31.583 --> 46:32.876
-Shut up.
-What?

46:32.960 --> 46:36.296
I'm gonna be an uncle?
Uncle Owen? Like Star Wars?

46:36.380 --> 46:38.090
Oh, my God. That's amazing.

46:39.758 --> 46:41.635
-What? How? With who?
-With me.

46:41.718 --> 46:44.096
I'm done waiting around for a good man.
I want a baby.

46:44.179 --> 46:46.723
So I went to a clinic
and all I know about the daddy

46:46.807 --> 46:50.477
is that he's getting his master's
in marine biology and I helped pay for it.

46:51.478 --> 46:53.146
I love sea turtles.

46:53.230 --> 46:56.233
-I get knocked up on Thursday.
-Congratulations.

46:57.317 --> 46:59.987
Honey. Aren't you happy for your sister?

47:00.070 --> 47:01.488
No. Not really, no.

47:01.572 --> 47:02.906
Come on, Clint.

47:02.990 --> 47:07.286
Come on, Carrie. I love you,
but you have no clue how to be a mom.

47:07.369 --> 47:10.038
-Come on, dude. Not cool, man.
-What are you talking about?

47:10.122 --> 47:12.541
Your sister was always really good to you,
wasn't she?

47:12.624 --> 47:14.168
It's okay. I understand how he feels.

47:14.251 --> 47:15.085
-I really do.
-See?

47:15.169 --> 47:18.755
Okay, I don't. You are incapable
of putting anyone ahead of yourself

47:18.839 --> 47:21.049
and I'm-- Oh, my God, I'm so done with it.

47:21.633 --> 47:23.427
No. Nora. Hey. Come on.

47:23.510 --> 47:24.720
-Don't do this. Don't. Come on.
-You know what?

47:24.803 --> 47:25.929
Hey, it's Christmas. It's Christmas.

47:26.013 --> 47:27.890
It's my fault, all right?

47:27.973 --> 47:33.604
I thought that I could change you
and only a fool would think that. Goodbye.

47:36.356 --> 47:37.649
All right. Bye, hon.

47:37.733 --> 47:40.068
-Suck it, Wendy.
-Okay, you too.

47:40.152 --> 47:43.572
You know-- So I was a little pigheaded.
Weren't you ever in your 20s?

47:44.072 --> 47:45.073
It's not about me.

47:46.325 --> 47:49.453
You know what? Why not?
Why isn't it about you?

47:49.536 --> 47:51.830
I don't get to know anything
about my accusers?

48:00.255 --> 48:02.049
Hey. You watching this?

48:02.549 --> 48:04.635
Senator, will you be resigning?

48:04.718 --> 48:06.553
Clint, you fabricated a scandal.

48:06.637 --> 48:07.596
La, la, la, la

48:07.679 --> 48:10.307
I'm not watching
your dramatic "reencrapment"

48:10.390 --> 48:11.850
until you tell me something about you.

48:11.934 --> 48:13.644
-You're acting like a child.
-I can't hear you.

48:13.727 --> 48:15.771
It's not crappy either.

48:15.854 --> 48:19.733
-It's very accurate. Hold CPM-104, please.
-I can't hear you.

48:20.234 --> 48:21.401
All right.

48:21.902 --> 48:22.903
Nice.

48:23.695 --> 48:25.989
I'll answer one question about me.

48:26.073 --> 48:27.324
Okay, five questions.

48:27.991 --> 48:29.618
-Two.
-Eight. Final offer.

48:29.701 --> 48:33.914
But we'll close at three. Okay.
Question one, were you ever alive?

48:35.374 --> 48:36.375
-Yes.
-When?

48:37.459 --> 48:39.628
Well, I've been dead nearly two centuries.

48:39.711 --> 48:41.755
What? Oh, my God.

48:41.839 --> 48:43.757
And you've been doing the same job
the whole time?

48:43.841 --> 48:47.511
No. No, I was…
First ten seasons, I was in research.

48:48.887 --> 48:51.723
-And then our GC Present retired.
-GC?

48:51.807 --> 48:53.684
-GC-- Ghost of Christmas Present…
-Ghost--

48:53.767 --> 48:57.354
-Yeah. Of course.
-…retired, and…

48:58.397 --> 49:00.482
-I was called up to the show.
-Oh, my God.

49:01.066 --> 49:02.109
You know that first save?

49:02.860 --> 49:04.528
-Incredible rush.
-Huge.

49:05.028 --> 49:06.572
Felt like
I was really making a difference.

49:07.447 --> 49:10.742
Was making a difference.
But you're not anymore?

49:13.203 --> 49:15.330
Okay, you know what?
I've answered your three questions.

49:15.414 --> 49:16.790
And you just answered my fourth.

49:16.874 --> 49:19.585
Why do you feel like that
you're not making a difference anymore?

49:19.668 --> 49:22.337
-What the hell is wrong with you?
-Me?

49:22.421 --> 49:25.549
I have never once had to put up
with this level of bullshit from a perp.

49:25.632 --> 49:29.052
-A perp?
-We are walking around in your past.

49:29.136 --> 49:31.972
Most people are too freaked out
to crawl up my ass

49:32.055 --> 49:34.975
with a bunch of stupid,
irrelevant questions.

49:35.058 --> 49:38.896
Stop it. Shut your dumb face
and just watch the scene.

49:39.897 --> 49:41.565
Resume CPM-104, please.

49:42.191 --> 49:45.027
Clint, you fabricated a scandal.

49:45.110 --> 49:46.361
I didn't fabricate--

49:46.445 --> 49:51.283
I suggested a scandal
that the public and the media ran with.

49:51.366 --> 49:54.369
-And it's gonna get our client elected.
-You destroyed that woman's life.

49:55.412 --> 49:57.331
We talked about these tactics.

49:58.248 --> 49:59.708
I didn't build this company

49:59.791 --> 50:01.919
so I wouldn't be able to look my kids
in the eye.

50:02.503 --> 50:05.297
Okay, I have put this off
long enough, but--

50:06.798 --> 50:07.925
Are you about to fire me?

50:08.008 --> 50:12.429
Clint, you're the brightest guy I know.
You're gonna land on your feet.

50:13.347 --> 50:18.018
No, I'm not gonna land on my feet,
Dan, I'm gonna land on you.

50:18.101 --> 50:19.937
When I take all of your clients with me.

50:20.020 --> 50:21.772
You have a noncompete clause.

50:21.855 --> 50:23.524
Which you will not enforce

50:23.607 --> 50:28.904
because you so fear what I can do
using these tactics which are beneath you.

50:30.322 --> 50:31.532
Merry Christmas, Dan.

50:33.575 --> 50:37.371
He built this company with honor
and integrity, and you destroyed it.

50:38.330 --> 50:39.831
Well done. Come on.

50:39.915 --> 50:43.252
Now hold on a second. Wait.

50:43.335 --> 50:46.129
You're taking me all out of context.
Wait, watch what happens next.

50:46.213 --> 50:48.590
Hey, Kimberly. I'm starting my own firm.

50:48.674 --> 50:50.843
I see greatness in you,
and it's being squandered here.

50:50.926 --> 50:53.262
I'm gonna make you an executive VP,
I will double your salary,

50:53.345 --> 50:56.682
but you gotta decide right now,
are you in or are you out?

50:58.392 --> 50:59.685
I--

51:03.021 --> 51:04.648
I guess I'm in.

51:04.731 --> 51:08.068
Great. Grab your coat.
Let's go build a dream.

51:08.694 --> 51:11.321
Nobody gives you credit for that, do they?
Believing in people.

51:11.405 --> 51:13.448
-Helping them live their best life.
-Best life?

51:13.532 --> 51:14.658
-Yes.
-Is that what you think?

51:14.741 --> 51:15.742
-100%.
-All right.

51:15.826 --> 51:17.202
You know what?

51:17.286 --> 51:20.414
Can you cue up DS-261
from a couple days ago?

51:20.497 --> 51:21.748
261? I cut that part.

51:21.832 --> 51:25.335
I realize it's a deleted scene.
I'm calling an audible. Okay, Bonnie?

51:25.419 --> 51:28.547
All right. God.
Has he said anything about me?

51:28.630 --> 51:31.091
-No.
-Okay, but, like, what's his vibe?

51:31.175 --> 51:32.509
I have no idea.

51:32.593 --> 51:34.845
Right. I know this is gonna sound weird,
but trust me,

51:34.928 --> 51:37.890
-it's strictly business.
-What?

51:37.973 --> 51:40.684
Can you smell his hair
and describe it to me?

51:40.767 --> 51:41.727
No.

51:41.810 --> 51:43.979
Hi. This is Margo from HR.

51:44.062 --> 51:47.733
I just wanna say,
everything is HR approved, totally okay.

51:47.816 --> 51:53.030
-Just go ahead with whatever you wanna do.
-Fine. Cotton candy.

51:53.614 --> 51:55.908
Oh, my God. That's so sexy.

51:55.991 --> 51:58.994
Now can you re-cue the scene, please?

51:59.077 --> 52:02.497
Right. 261 coming at ya.
Audible, I remember.

52:03.207 --> 52:06.293
So this boy Wren's running against,
Josh Hubbins?

52:06.376 --> 52:09.129
Well,
Josh's family runs a Christmas Day dinner

52:09.213 --> 52:11.298
-at a homeless shelter…
-This was, like, two days ago.

52:11.381 --> 52:12.925
I mean, I remember what ha--

52:13.008 --> 52:14.927
…quickly deleted this on TikTok.

52:15.010 --> 52:17.095
When your parents
make you eat Christmas dinner

52:17.179 --> 52:19.097
with homeless people. Gross.

52:21.099 --> 52:24.853
I am outraged.
I told you Kimberly was the best.

52:24.937 --> 52:27.481
Once Josh is done trumpeting
his annual good deed, Wrenny,

52:27.564 --> 52:30.275
you post that video,
start writing your acceptance speech,

52:30.359 --> 52:31.485
and Bob's your uncle.

52:31.568 --> 52:33.153
Okay, you're right.

52:33.237 --> 52:34.696
I mean, he's just a kid…

52:34.780 --> 52:36.240
Do I regret saying, "Bob's your uncle"?

52:36.323 --> 52:38.700
Yeah, I do. But I made the choice,
and I gotta live with it.

52:38.784 --> 52:41.787
Look, I just ask that you respect me
and my family's privacy.

52:44.748 --> 52:45.749
What happened?

52:47.084 --> 52:50.212
What was that? My face is burning.

52:51.547 --> 52:55.259
-Can we slow down and talk about--
-Can't believe we get one elevator a day.

52:55.342 --> 52:58.512
Gotta catch this one. Bye, guys. Like ya.

52:58.595 --> 53:01.390
See? Now, does that look like
someone who's living her best life?

53:03.183 --> 53:05.561
It's official. I'm a terrible person.

53:06.061 --> 53:07.187
No, you're not.

53:08.605 --> 53:09.731
Excuse me?

53:09.815 --> 53:12.276
Hold on a second. What? Wait. Hold on.

53:12.359 --> 53:14.069
-Hold on 261.
-Have we met?

53:14.152 --> 53:16.822
We're all good.
Yep, make it go away. Thank you.

53:16.905 --> 53:19.658
What were you doing in this?
How was she talking to you?

53:21.034 --> 53:22.119
I don't know.

53:22.202 --> 53:25.622
I was scouting you,
and then she looked right at me.

53:25.706 --> 53:30.002
And we just--
We just started talking, and it's--

53:30.544 --> 53:31.837
Actually, never mind.

53:31.920 --> 53:34.923
The point is that Kimberly's
a really good person, all right?

53:35.007 --> 53:37.134
-And you're just--
-Are you allowed to interfere

53:37.217 --> 53:39.803
-in the lives of the people that you--
-I'm trying to show the effect

53:39.887 --> 53:41.722
-your choices have--
-Not really answering my question.

53:41.805 --> 53:44.183
-I'm done dicking around with you, pal.
-Wow, sugar mouth.

53:44.266 --> 53:49.771
-Cue up CPM-163. Yes. Now.
-Not CPM-163, no.

53:50.272 --> 53:51.440
No. I can't--

54:06.121 --> 54:07.664
Hey, guys.

54:07.748 --> 54:09.583
Hey, Wrenny. Look what Uncle Clint got ya.

54:10.167 --> 54:11.418
-Cool.
-Yeah.

54:11.502 --> 54:14.129
Mom, can I donate it to the sick kids?

54:14.213 --> 54:16.006
That would be really nice, sweetheart.

54:16.089 --> 54:19.134
-There's a bin down in the lobby, okay?
-Yeah, give it away. Glad we wrapped it.

54:19.218 --> 54:21.553
It's next to the teddy bear, okay?
Have Martha help you.

54:22.429 --> 54:25.265
Well, you're certainly looking brighter
than you were before.

54:25.349 --> 54:28.727
Clint, don't.
Before she comes back, listen.

54:29.937 --> 54:31.730
It's time that I made some arrangements.

54:32.689 --> 54:35.776
Okay-- Stop it.

54:35.859 --> 54:37.611
I need to ask you a favor.

54:38.320 --> 54:39.530
And it's a doozy.

54:40.322 --> 54:42.407
-No, we're not doing this.
-When I'm gone--

54:42.491 --> 54:43.784
No.

54:43.867 --> 54:45.953
-This is a key moment-- Mr. Briggs.
-No--

54:47.120 --> 54:48.622
Mr. Briggs!

54:48.705 --> 54:49.665
We got a runner!

54:52.459 --> 54:53.585
We got a runner!

55:00.634 --> 55:01.927
What are you so afraid of?

55:03.011 --> 55:06.390
I'm afraid of you
telling her to tank her grades.

55:06.473 --> 55:09.059
And hurt another kid.
And she's listening to you.

55:09.142 --> 55:12.229
I never said
this was gonna be the easy way.

55:12.312 --> 55:14.815
She wanted to win.
And that means you have to play hardball.

55:14.898 --> 55:16.984
Yes, Clint, but she has a good heart…

55:17.067 --> 55:19.152
Señor, por favor.

55:20.529 --> 55:22.406
No. Señor.

55:22.906 --> 55:23.907
Señor!

55:36.837 --> 55:37.963
We've got a breach.

55:38.630 --> 55:42.968
-Mr. Briggs.
-Non.

55:43.552 --> 55:44.887
Je ne peux parler français. Non.

55:46.013 --> 55:47.639
Je m'excuse.

55:57.941 --> 55:58.942
Nuts.

56:06.158 --> 56:08.202
Everything's cool. Back to work, everyone!

56:22.090 --> 56:24.885
Hey, that memory in the hospital.

56:24.968 --> 56:27.846
That's what we call a kicker.

56:27.930 --> 56:32.309
It's a key moment
that has to be faced in order to,

56:32.392 --> 56:33.727
you know, effect any real change.

56:33.810 --> 56:37.439
What are all these pictures
of my executive VP doing up here?

56:37.523 --> 56:39.608
Just, you know, research.

56:39.691 --> 56:41.318
Did you Photoshop yourself into this one?

56:42.486 --> 56:45.906
-Did I? I don't think so.
-You did.

56:45.989 --> 56:49.701
Look,
I may have pushed you into your kicker,

56:50.452 --> 56:52.287
you know,
before you were really ready for it.

56:52.371 --> 56:55.457
And I just wanna say… I'm sorry.

56:55.541 --> 56:57.709
Oh, no. I'm sure that you gotta go big

56:57.793 --> 57:00.504
if you're trying to redeem
an unredeemable.

57:07.052 --> 57:10.806
Listen… That doesn't have to be true.

57:11.473 --> 57:16.353
Does it? I really believe
you can be a positive force for mankind.

57:16.436 --> 57:19.064
Like you? How's that going for ya?

57:19.815 --> 57:21.900
You've been at this 200 years.

57:23.610 --> 57:25.696
Is mankind getting any man-kinder?

57:27.906 --> 57:30.617
More genial? United?

57:33.328 --> 57:37.040
Wanna know what mankind really is?
Read the comments below.

57:39.251 --> 57:42.337
That's who we really are.
And you know what, I accept that.

57:43.338 --> 57:45.007
'Cause I gotta live in it, pal.

57:45.090 --> 57:47.217
I don't have the luxury
of sitting up here,

57:47.301 --> 57:50.095
judging everybody
like some kind of cosmic social worker.

57:52.055 --> 57:56.935
-Is that what you think I am?
-Yes, I do. And we are done here.

58:13.660 --> 58:16.079
What? What's with the dramatic look? You--

58:16.580 --> 58:19.541
Do you think I'm gonna be all intrigued
by what's behind the door? I--

58:20.918 --> 58:21.919
Forget it.

58:23.253 --> 58:24.963
Not even a little bit curious?

58:25.464 --> 58:27.841
Actually, no. I'm really not.

58:29.176 --> 58:31.345
-Clint?
-Yes?

58:36.558 --> 58:41.063
-Clint! Let's go. Right now.
-Damn it.

58:57.371 --> 58:58.372
This is yours.

59:01.250 --> 59:03.168
Come here, you little blighter!

59:03.252 --> 59:05.379
You asked if I was ever alive.

59:06.922 --> 59:07.840
Yeah.

59:08.799 --> 59:09.800
What, the kid?

59:10.843 --> 59:11.844
That's you?

59:18.934 --> 59:20.310
Yes?

59:20.394 --> 59:24.231
Mr. Scrooge, I'm Woodrow, sir.

59:25.566 --> 59:28.777
Well, I have nothing for you,
boy. So good afternoon.

59:28.861 --> 59:31.405
There's no call
for that kind of language, sir.

59:31.488 --> 59:33.699
I said, good afternoon.

59:33.782 --> 59:37.202
Shame on you, sir.
Saying such a thing to a child.

59:37.286 --> 59:39.162
A good afternoon to you, madam.

59:41.039 --> 59:43.041
So you're telling me the Dickens story is…

59:43.125 --> 59:44.793
-Please, sir.
-…is based on you?

59:44.877 --> 59:46.420
-What is it, boy?
-Yeah.

59:47.004 --> 59:50.048
Me and my father work at the mill.
The one you just shut down.

59:50.132 --> 59:51.383
Yes. And?

59:51.466 --> 59:53.594
The mill is still quite profitable, sir.

59:53.677 --> 59:55.762
But a thousand people
have been put out of work.

59:56.263 --> 59:57.973
And at a time
they ought to be making merry.

59:58.056 --> 1:00:00.517
Making merry? Humbug!

1:00:00.601 --> 1:00:03.478
When your father
fails to make his mortgage

1:00:03.562 --> 1:00:05.522
and I buy your home for a pittance,

1:00:05.606 --> 1:00:08.150
that will make me most merry indeed.

1:00:08.233 --> 1:00:09.568
Good afternoon!

1:00:14.239 --> 1:00:16.950
Okay, yes. You were a huge dick.

1:00:18.202 --> 1:00:19.203
Wow.

1:00:19.912 --> 1:00:22.748
The only other unredeemable
to go through the program.

1:00:23.957 --> 1:00:26.126
So I do understand the weight you carry.

1:00:28.045 --> 1:00:29.379
Sooner or later,

1:00:30.756 --> 1:00:32.382
it becomes unbearable.

1:00:48.023 --> 1:00:49.358
I don't think she can see us.

1:00:51.151 --> 1:00:52.152
Right.

1:00:52.236 --> 1:00:53.237
Madam.

1:00:54.488 --> 1:00:56.615
All right, then. Hold your horses.

1:01:02.621 --> 1:01:03.455
Whatever.

1:01:05.791 --> 1:01:07.000
There we go.

1:01:07.084 --> 1:01:08.293
Thank you.

1:01:08.377 --> 1:01:09.378
Cheers.

1:01:11.421 --> 1:01:12.756
Oh, my God.

1:01:14.049 --> 1:01:16.093
That is man piss.

1:01:16.176 --> 1:01:17.553
-Isn't that nice?
-It's warm.

1:01:17.636 --> 1:01:19.596
-It's almost hot.
-It's perfect.

1:01:20.138 --> 1:01:24.810
So, I just wanna fully understand this.
You were Scrooge.

1:01:25.978 --> 1:01:28.146
The ghost changed you,
but you never relapsed.

1:01:28.230 --> 1:01:30.899
The rest of your life,
not one single humbug ever again.

1:01:31.441 --> 1:01:32.526
The rest of my life.

1:01:32.609 --> 1:01:35.654
How long was it?
The rest of your life, I mean.

1:01:35.737 --> 1:01:39.658
-Roughly three-and-a-half weeks.
-Years.

1:01:40.242 --> 1:01:41.243
-What?
-Yeah.

1:01:41.743 --> 1:01:42.953
-You're kidding?
-No.

1:01:43.036 --> 1:01:44.371
-Really?
-Uh-huh. Yeah.

1:01:46.623 --> 1:01:51.211
Sorry. What finally did it?

1:01:51.295 --> 1:01:53.755
-Like, what got you?
-Nothing fancy.

1:01:53.839 --> 1:01:57.176
The leading cause of death back then
was January.

1:01:57.259 --> 1:01:58.260
No.

1:02:02.264 --> 1:02:05.392
But how did you--
How did you even know that you changed?

1:02:05.475 --> 1:02:08.854
I mean, you know, anybody
can be good for three weeks, right?

1:02:08.937 --> 1:02:10.147
I mean--

1:02:26.079 --> 1:02:29.541
Hey,
why did all those people get offended?

1:02:30.542 --> 1:02:32.586
You know, when you said, "Good afternoon"?

1:02:34.296 --> 1:02:38.800
Well, in the 1800s,
"good afternoon" was a sick burn.

1:02:38.884 --> 1:02:43.138
-No.
-Yes. More or less meant "F you."

1:02:43.222 --> 1:02:45.349
-Really?
-Extremely graphic.

1:02:45.933 --> 1:02:47.768
Yeah, why don't you try it?

1:02:47.851 --> 1:02:50.896
You know, bust one out on somebody.
I think it'll make you feel better.

1:02:50.979 --> 1:02:52.356
-No.
-None of this is real.

1:02:52.439 --> 1:02:56.276
I-- Clint, I appreciate
what you're trying to do, but I'm fine.

1:03:00.864 --> 1:03:05.118
Now, fellow, here you are
In a shitty British bar

1:03:05.202 --> 1:03:08.997
With a frothy little frown
Upon your lips

1:03:09.081 --> 1:03:12.125
Another pint for me friend, extra warm

1:03:12.626 --> 1:03:14.253
Your accent blows.

1:03:14.336 --> 1:03:17.548
Well, I beg to differ.

1:03:19.258 --> 1:03:23.637
As you're drowning in that ale
You're feeling like a fail

1:03:23.720 --> 1:03:27.474
You're sorrier
Than soggy fish and chips

1:03:28.100 --> 1:03:32.646
But you don't have to sit and pout
Just let your inner Scrooge come out

1:03:32.729 --> 1:03:37.025
'Cause why should any other jerk
Enjoy his day?

1:03:37.526 --> 1:03:42.239
When ya down in the dumps
And need some cheering upsies

1:03:42.990 --> 1:03:46.326
Turn and tap a hapless chap

1:03:46.910 --> 1:03:50.497
And sweetly say

1:03:52.583 --> 1:03:53.584
Good afternoon.

1:03:54.126 --> 1:03:55.043
Good afternoon

1:03:55.127 --> 1:03:55.961
Well, I never.

1:03:56.044 --> 1:03:58.755
Just let one fly
And you'll be smiling pretty soon

1:03:58.839 --> 1:04:00.591
Like this
Good afternoon

1:04:00.674 --> 1:04:02.843
-I beg your pardon?
-You pompous arse.

1:04:02.926 --> 1:04:06.763
It's like "piss off"
But with a little touch of class

1:04:06.847 --> 1:04:10.184
Oh, two little words
Can totally change a tune

1:04:10.267 --> 1:04:11.685
-Good afternoon.
-Good afternoon!

1:04:11.768 --> 1:04:13.103
Good afternoon.

1:04:13.770 --> 1:04:16.064
Good afternoon.

1:04:16.148 --> 1:04:17.232
I'm sensing no.

1:04:22.029 --> 1:04:25.324
So you've done nothing wrong
In so very, very long

1:04:25.407 --> 1:04:27.784
And I get
It's an important point of pride

1:04:27.868 --> 1:04:28.952
It's part of my job.

1:04:29.036 --> 1:04:32.789
But come on, now don't stay quiet
You know you wanna try it

1:04:32.873 --> 1:04:35.918
Better to never let all of the bitter
Be bottled up inside

1:04:36.001 --> 1:04:39.546
Oi! Out of the road, dingus.

1:04:41.548 --> 1:04:44.051
Oh, come on, bub.

1:04:44.551 --> 1:04:48.013
He's got it coming. You know you want to.

1:04:48.555 --> 1:04:52.184
Come on. It's right there.

1:04:53.185 --> 1:04:55.687
Just let it…

1:04:56.772 --> 1:04:59.233
-Good afternoon!
-Yes!

1:04:59.316 --> 1:05:01.151
-Good afternoon
-The hell you say?

1:05:01.235 --> 1:05:03.820
Sir, you're a wankerous
Cantankerous buffoon

1:05:03.904 --> 1:05:04.947
What's all this, then?

1:05:05.030 --> 1:05:07.366
Good afternoon
You smell of shite

1:05:08.367 --> 1:05:11.036
Now we didn't say good morning
Or good night

1:05:11.119 --> 1:05:12.704
-That's right!
-Get back here!

1:05:14.706 --> 1:05:17.709
Yes, two little words
Can totally change a tune

1:05:17.793 --> 1:05:19.336
-Good afternoon
-Good afternoon

1:05:19.419 --> 1:05:20.587
Good afternoon

1:05:23.048 --> 1:05:25.008
-She clogged the loo.
-Good afternoon.

1:05:25.092 --> 1:05:26.760
-He diddled your wife.
-Good afternoon.

1:05:26.844 --> 1:05:29.096
It meant not a thing,
I swear upon my life.

1:05:29.179 --> 1:05:30.055
Good afternoon.

1:05:30.138 --> 1:05:31.765
-He has the plague.
-Good afternoon.

1:05:31.849 --> 1:05:33.600
-She called you a whore.
-Good afternoon.

1:05:33.684 --> 1:05:36.103
I'm an orphan.
Please, sir, may I have some more?

1:05:36.186 --> 1:05:37.563
Good afternoon.

1:05:38.230 --> 1:05:39.231
Hello, Governor.

1:05:39.314 --> 1:05:40.190
Good afternoon.

1:05:40.274 --> 1:05:41.859
-Pardon his French.
-Good afternoon.

1:05:41.942 --> 1:05:45.445
Just deplore them with decorum
Like you're Judi bloody Dench

1:05:45.988 --> 1:05:50.617
-Wait. Was that Judi Dench?
-Oh, my God. She's a national treasure.

1:05:50.701 --> 1:05:53.704
-I love her in everything.
-I loved her in that Chocolate.

1:05:53.787 --> 1:05:57.624
-Chocolat.
-Chocolat.

1:05:59.209 --> 1:06:02.796
While we're strutting
Through the streets of London town

1:06:02.880 --> 1:06:06.300
The quickest little pick-me-up
Is kicking people down

1:06:16.351 --> 1:06:19.146
That's for you. Yeah.

1:06:26.987 --> 1:06:28.614
Good afternoon!

1:06:51.845 --> 1:06:54.056
Good afternoon

1:06:54.139 --> 1:06:56.183
It's tons of fun

1:06:56.266 --> 1:06:59.853
And if you're shocked
Then you can kiss my Dickens, son!

1:07:00.521 --> 1:07:01.522
Kiss it.

1:07:01.605 --> 1:07:03.899
-No. Stop!
-Son! Eve-- What?

1:07:03.982 --> 1:07:05.692
No, it's Charles Dickens.
It's a fun little thing.

1:07:05.776 --> 1:07:07.778
-Yes, thank you. But there is a baby--
-None of this is real.

1:07:08.320 --> 1:07:09.821
There's a baby.

1:07:11.073 --> 1:07:12.074
Madam.

1:07:12.699 --> 1:07:14.493
-I am so sorry.
-He should be.

1:07:15.869 --> 1:07:16.870
And ma'am…

1:07:17.788 --> 1:07:18.872
Good afternoon!

1:07:19.873 --> 1:07:23.168
Good afternoon
Our favorite swear

1:07:23.252 --> 1:07:26.672
Just let a little vile
Fill the village square

1:07:26.755 --> 1:07:28.841
A pin to pop some prick's balloon

1:07:28.924 --> 1:07:30.676
And nobody is immune

1:07:30.759 --> 1:07:33.720
For giving a man
A kick in the pantaloon

1:07:33.804 --> 1:07:37.015
Oh, two little words
Can totally change a tune

1:07:37.099 --> 1:07:39.059
-Good afternoon
-Good afternoon

1:07:39.142 --> 1:07:40.310
Good afternoon

1:07:40.394 --> 1:07:42.354
Good afternoon, good afternoon

1:07:42.437 --> 1:07:45.190
Good afternoon

1:07:45.274 --> 1:07:47.067
Good afternoon, good afternoon

1:07:47.150 --> 1:07:50.904
Good afternoon, good afternoon

1:07:53.657 --> 1:07:54.700
That's-- He's dead.

1:07:54.783 --> 1:07:57.077
-Yeah, he's definitely-- No, he's fine.
-No. He's good.

1:07:57.160 --> 1:07:59.037
-Well, none of it's real, anyway.
-Wow, he's squirrelly.

1:07:59.121 --> 1:08:00.581
How did you know all that?

1:08:00.664 --> 1:08:02.749
-I didn't. I was just following you.
-You were following me?

1:08:02.833 --> 1:08:04.793
-Yeah.
-I messed up in the middle there.

1:08:04.877 --> 1:08:06.461
-Yeah, tap is new for me.
-A little. Yeah.

1:08:06.545 --> 1:08:08.755
-It's a very expressive medium though.
-And they all knew too.

1:08:11.550 --> 1:08:13.844
-A word, please.
-Right, just…

1:08:16.013 --> 1:08:19.224
Okay. Hear me out.
I know what you're gonna say.

1:08:19.308 --> 1:08:21.059
But I was losing him, okay?

1:08:21.143 --> 1:08:23.729
And I just thought if he could see
that I was an unredeemable too--

1:08:23.812 --> 1:08:26.564
So, you thought it might be a fine idea

1:08:26.648 --> 1:08:30.152
to take him on a little field trip
into your own past?

1:08:31.153 --> 1:08:32.779
I should've made you take
your retirement package

1:08:32.863 --> 1:08:35.282
when you asked for it,
rather than risk everything

1:08:35.365 --> 1:08:36.408
on this unredeemable.

1:08:36.491 --> 1:08:38.118
-No. Hey.
-No, of course not.

1:08:38.202 --> 1:08:41.913
I may not be getting with your program,
but it's not for his lack of trying.

1:08:41.997 --> 1:08:44.457
-This guy has been busting my balls.
-Back to bed, Mr. Briggs.

1:08:44.541 --> 1:08:45.709
"Back to bed." I--

1:08:47.627 --> 1:08:51.715
And you. From now on,
I want everything on script. Understand?

1:08:51.798 --> 1:08:56.345
-Jacob, I was just trying--
-On script!

1:08:57.429 --> 1:08:59.348
Okay. On script.

1:09:00.640 --> 1:09:01.808
Say it a few more times next time.

1:09:02.725 --> 1:09:04.019
Good afternoon.

1:09:05.562 --> 1:09:07.064
Excuse me?

1:09:08.023 --> 1:09:09.233
What was that?

1:09:14.321 --> 1:09:15.404
Good afternoon.

1:09:17.366 --> 1:09:20.077
It wasn't me. I heard it too.
I don't know what that was.

1:09:35.843 --> 1:09:37.386
Hey, Clint.

1:09:37.970 --> 1:09:40.514
-Hey, Charlie. What's up?
-Hey. First of all, love the look.

1:09:40.596 --> 1:09:42.515
-Thank you. What do you want?
-GQ Santa.

1:09:43.140 --> 1:09:45.769
That rumor about
artificial Christmas trees off-gassing.

1:09:45.853 --> 1:09:46.854
-Right.
-Genius.

1:09:46.937 --> 1:09:48.729
-Thank you.
-Brilliant. Look at this. It's trending.

1:09:48.814 --> 1:09:49.814
That's-- It's--

1:09:50.314 --> 1:09:53.569
Will you excuse me? I'm gonna figure out
what the hell that's all about.

1:09:54.361 --> 1:09:55.654
What what's all about?

1:09:59.157 --> 1:10:01.535
Come in and know me better, man.

1:10:02.452 --> 1:10:05.289
What in the hell is this?

1:10:05.372 --> 1:10:09.084
-I am The Ghost of Christmas Present.
-Your boss chews you out

1:10:09.168 --> 1:10:12.379
-and now you're going full Dickens on me?
-Look, I gotta go by the book now.

1:10:12.462 --> 1:10:15.007
Can I have one of these? What do
they mean by your retirement package?

1:10:15.090 --> 1:10:16.633
Clint, please.

1:10:16.717 --> 1:10:17.926
Why do you want to retire?

1:10:18.010 --> 1:10:20.846
I only threatened to retire as leverage

1:10:20.929 --> 1:10:23.390
to get him to approve you
as this year's perp.

1:10:23.473 --> 1:10:24.600
Retire to where?

1:10:26.226 --> 1:10:27.728
Where does a ghost retire to?

1:10:28.478 --> 1:10:31.607
For the last time, Mr. Briggs,
this isn't about me.

1:10:32.107 --> 1:10:34.151
Now we're back to Mr. Briggs and a perp.

1:10:34.234 --> 1:10:35.986
You know what,
I'm gonna get back to my guests.

1:10:36.069 --> 1:10:37.070
And you can stay up here

1:10:37.154 --> 1:10:40.282
-in your giant toilet of food.
-No. Clint, Clinty. Hold on.

1:10:40.365 --> 1:10:41.909
All right. If I tell you…

1:10:42.910 --> 1:10:45.412
will you cut the crap and just come along?

1:10:45.495 --> 1:10:46.830
Sure.

1:10:48.040 --> 1:10:50.667
Fine. You're killing me.

1:10:50.751 --> 1:10:51.960
Good.

1:10:53.253 --> 1:10:58.050
All right. My retirement package,
if I were to choose to collect it,

1:10:58.133 --> 1:11:01.386
is a gold watch, a Sephora gift card,

1:11:01.470 --> 1:11:05.599
and the chance to return to Earth and
live out the rest of my life as a mortal.

1:11:07.684 --> 1:11:08.810
And you want that.

1:11:08.894 --> 1:11:13.065
You know, what I want is for you
to shut up and let me do my job.

1:11:13.148 --> 1:11:14.274
That's what I want.

1:11:14.858 --> 1:11:16.610
Great. Do your job.

1:11:16.693 --> 1:11:18.612
-Grab my hand.
-We're doing this?

1:11:18.695 --> 1:11:20.697
We're doing it.
It's gonna be quite a ride.

1:11:21.615 --> 1:11:22.991
Oh, my God.

1:11:23.742 --> 1:11:24.826
Bonnie.

1:11:24.910 --> 1:11:28.372
Remember, the key word is "quite a ride.''

1:11:42.469 --> 1:11:45.514
Here we are. Our first stop.

1:11:46.515 --> 1:11:48.475
We were just here.

1:11:48.559 --> 1:11:51.270
Listen,
I have a whole department of people

1:11:51.353 --> 1:11:53.021
who work very hard on these transitions.

1:11:53.105 --> 1:11:55.732
Whatever. Doesn't matter.
I know exactly what's going on.

1:11:56.233 --> 1:11:57.192
-Do you?
-Yes, I do.

1:11:57.693 --> 1:12:01.280
I mean, I love Clint. He's great.
I consider him a friend.

1:12:01.363 --> 1:12:02.990
See? A friend.

1:12:03.824 --> 1:12:06.201
I mean, as much as anyone can be friends
with Clint.

1:12:06.285 --> 1:12:08.287
Have you tried
telling him about your personal life?

1:12:08.370 --> 1:12:10.289
See how long it takes
for his eyes to glaze over.

1:12:11.498 --> 1:12:13.959
Oh, my God. They're shit-whispering me.

1:12:14.042 --> 1:12:16.170
Yes, they are shit-whispering you.

1:12:16.253 --> 1:12:17.588
-You're talking about Clint?
-Yeah.

1:12:17.671 --> 1:12:22.676
Yeah. He can be a little self-absorbed,
but here's the thing

1:12:22.759 --> 1:12:24.303
that you guys should understand
about Clint.

1:12:24.386 --> 1:12:27.389
As a kid, he was alone a lot.

1:12:28.265 --> 1:12:30.893
And he learned
the only person that he could count on

1:12:32.019 --> 1:12:33.020
was himself.

1:12:33.604 --> 1:12:36.940
So, you know, don't be too hard on him.

1:12:39.276 --> 1:12:41.403
He's good inside. I should know.
He's my big brother.

1:12:42.070 --> 1:12:43.864
Wow. Yeah, I love him.

1:12:44.364 --> 1:12:47.409
Well, if it isn't
The Ghost of Christmas Present.

1:12:47.492 --> 1:12:49.620
Kimberly, hey. Hi.

1:12:49.703 --> 1:12:50.954
You must be here to haunt Clint.

1:12:51.997 --> 1:12:54.333
So she can see you.
Does she know about all of this?

1:12:54.416 --> 1:12:56.460
No. Not really.

1:12:56.543 --> 1:13:01.006
-I love your costume. Rudolph.
-Thank you.

1:13:01.089 --> 1:13:02.382
You look adorable.

1:13:02.466 --> 1:13:04.301
Always with the compliments.

1:13:05.052 --> 1:13:06.762
Now I'm actually kinda glad I came.

1:13:07.304 --> 1:13:08.305
Yeah.

1:13:11.099 --> 1:13:12.100
Me too.

1:13:14.436 --> 1:13:17.856
I knew it. You let her see you
because you're into her.

1:13:17.940 --> 1:13:21.318
But, I mean, who throws a work party
on Christmas actual Eve?

1:13:21.401 --> 1:13:22.819
Only Clint, right?

1:13:22.903 --> 1:13:23.904
Son of a--

1:13:23.987 --> 1:13:25.197
It's a power move.

1:13:25.280 --> 1:13:28.033
Now you guys are shit-whispering me too.
Let's go. Come on. What's next?

1:13:28.617 --> 1:13:30.786
Sorry. I was actually on my way out.

1:13:30.869 --> 1:13:31.954
Yeah. Okay.

1:13:32.037 --> 1:13:34.039
I thought
we were gonna do things by the book.

1:13:34.957 --> 1:13:36.375
It was great seeing you, though.

1:13:37.793 --> 1:13:38.794
Yeah.

1:13:39.294 --> 1:13:40.212
You too.

1:13:44.299 --> 1:13:46.718
-It's okay. Just the one tonight.
-Whoa!

1:13:47.719 --> 1:13:48.929
Wow, I love it.

1:13:49.429 --> 1:13:51.640
Yeah. Ex-girlfriend, I get it.

1:13:51.723 --> 1:13:53.475
-Family I could've had.
-Thanks, Mommy.

1:13:53.559 --> 1:13:56.478
Honestly, I-- I'm--
I'm really happy for Nora.

1:13:57.688 --> 1:14:00.065
Why can't you just admit
that you let Kimberly see you?

1:14:00.148 --> 1:14:02.150
I didn't let her see me. She just--

1:14:02.234 --> 1:14:05.988
Oh, come on.
I see the way you look at her.

1:14:06.905 --> 1:14:08.407
I really think that you wanna retire.

1:14:08.490 --> 1:14:10.325
-You don't know me.
-You don't know you.

1:14:10.409 --> 1:14:12.369
You think you're better off than that guy?

1:14:13.453 --> 1:14:16.665
-Thanks, honey.
-Look, you think this'll tempt me?

1:14:17.291 --> 1:14:20.002
Something cozy? Something stable?

1:14:20.919 --> 1:14:23.755
Stuck on some suburban street with--

1:14:23.839 --> 1:14:26.550
Is that meat loaf on the table?

1:14:27.676 --> 1:14:29.678
See, you'll claim this is my dream

1:14:30.262 --> 1:14:32.472
But we both know that's not true

1:14:32.556 --> 1:14:35.225
So let's shift the conversation

1:14:36.268 --> 1:14:37.811
'Cause this dream

1:14:37.895 --> 1:14:41.231
Belongs to you

1:14:45.027 --> 1:14:46.737
-Tear into 'em.
-Right?

1:14:46.820 --> 1:14:48.697
-You don't have to save the paper.
-Yeah.

1:14:55.454 --> 1:14:56.288
Yeah,

1:14:56.371 --> 1:15:00.667
or maybe I put the greater common good
above my own personal fulfillment.

1:15:00.751 --> 1:15:02.503
But you wouldn't understand that,
would you?

1:15:03.003 --> 1:15:06.798
So being human again would be
personally fulfilling for you, then?

1:15:07.382 --> 1:15:11.345
The story of your life
A whole new narrative

1:15:11.428 --> 1:15:13.138
-I'm tired.
-Me too.

1:15:13.222 --> 1:15:17.851
The story with the wife and kids
You clearly want to live

1:15:19.019 --> 1:15:24.149
You almost had your shot at love
Until, you know, you died

1:15:24.816 --> 1:15:29.780
But I can help you have it
Be your wingman, be your guide

1:15:30.364 --> 1:15:35.494
You might rewrite
The story of your life

1:15:35.577 --> 1:15:37.788
Have to make sure you're in bed
when Santa comes.

1:15:37.871 --> 1:15:40.082
The one you've been denied

1:15:40.165 --> 1:15:43.752
I could help you with Kimberly. I mean,
you guys were really vibing back there.

1:15:44.628 --> 1:15:47.297
-Really? Do you really think so?
-Yes.

1:15:47.381 --> 1:15:50.217
-Her eyes are so adorable when she laughs.
-They are.

1:15:51.885 --> 1:15:53.637
Wait.
I know what you're trying to do. Come on.

1:15:54.263 --> 1:15:56.056
All right, that's a firm grip. All right.

1:15:56.139 --> 1:15:57.850
You're just extraordinary. You know that?

1:15:57.933 --> 1:15:59.142
Are we going to Narnia?

1:16:06.900 --> 1:16:09.361
Wait. No. What are you doing?
What are y-- Hey!

1:16:09.444 --> 1:16:11.989
The story of your life

1:16:12.489 --> 1:16:14.241
The dream you dare to chase

1:16:14.324 --> 1:16:15.534
Get off the table, please.

1:16:15.617 --> 1:16:20.789
The story of your life
Watch the pieces all fall into place

1:16:20.873 --> 1:16:23.750
You haven't felt a woman's touch
In so very--

1:16:23.834 --> 1:16:25.085
Stop it!

1:16:25.169 --> 1:16:27.045
Wha-- Wow. Not a duet.

1:16:27.129 --> 1:16:29.381
Are you five years old?
Get down from there.

1:16:29.464 --> 1:16:31.383
-This is a homeless shelter.
-They can't see us.

1:16:31.466 --> 1:16:33.385
-I'm trying to help you.
-I don't want your help.

1:16:33.468 --> 1:16:37.181
I'm here to help you.
So stop it and pay attention.

1:16:37.264 --> 1:16:40.017
Fine. Whatever.
Am I supposed to know this kid?

1:16:40.100 --> 1:16:41.727
-That's Josh Hubbins.
-Here you go. Merry Christmas.

1:16:41.810 --> 1:16:43.520
Wren's opponent
for student body president.

1:16:44.229 --> 1:16:47.316
Whose life you told your niece to cancel.

1:16:47.399 --> 1:16:50.194
I sent you a great pic.
You should post it.

1:16:51.403 --> 1:16:53.030
-Might be a vote-getter.
-Might not be.

1:16:53.113 --> 1:16:56.325
I don't know. I don't want people to think
I'm only doing this to win the election.

1:16:56.408 --> 1:16:58.118
-Proud of you, buddy.
-Uh-huh.

1:16:58.202 --> 1:16:59.661
But I think it'd be fine to post it.

1:17:02.414 --> 1:17:06.668
See? He doesn't want to post about it.
Maybe he's a good, humble kid who just--

1:17:06.752 --> 1:17:08.712
And he posted it.

1:17:08.795 --> 1:17:10.631
With a humblebrag. Shocking.

1:17:10.714 --> 1:17:13.383
Wanna show me some more stuff
I'm right about? It's getting fun again.

1:17:13.467 --> 1:17:14.343
-Quiet.
-Hey.

1:17:14.426 --> 1:17:16.261
You ever just stare in the mirror
and think,

1:17:16.345 --> 1:17:18.555
-"Does this wreath make me look like a--"
-Okay. No more questions.

1:17:18.639 --> 1:17:20.015
-No more questions?
-No more questions. Wait here.

1:17:20.098 --> 1:17:21.225
I'm just getting started with the quest--

1:17:26.980 --> 1:17:28.357
That's just fun to watch.

1:17:34.446 --> 1:17:37.741
Can you please tell Bonnie
or whoever's in charge of transitions

1:17:37.824 --> 1:17:39.952
-that this is getting ridiculous?
-Uncle Owen.

1:17:41.370 --> 1:17:42.996
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

1:17:43.872 --> 1:17:45.499
How do you never get better at this?

1:17:45.582 --> 1:17:49.169
How are you so good at this?
We only do it once a year.

1:17:49.253 --> 1:17:51.171
Your brother's such a good man.

1:17:51.964 --> 1:17:53.507
-You want some cocoa?
-Sure.

1:17:53.590 --> 1:17:55.217
You know I pay for everything, right?

1:17:55.717 --> 1:17:56.718
You're gross.

1:17:58.512 --> 1:17:59.513
Yeah, he is.

1:18:02.099 --> 1:18:03.100
All good.

1:18:04.810 --> 1:18:07.604
Looks like Wren's trying to decide
whether to take her uncle's advice.

1:18:07.688 --> 1:18:10.691
She's probably not even gonna post it
because she takes after my sister--

1:18:10.774 --> 1:18:12.234
And she posted it.

1:18:12.317 --> 1:18:14.528
You wanna see some more things
you're wrong about?

1:18:15.487 --> 1:18:18.574
You know, I'm happy for her. If you
wanna make your school a better place,

1:18:18.657 --> 1:18:21.743
you're gonna have to accept
certain uncomfortable truths, and that's…

1:18:44.016 --> 1:18:45.767
-Enjoy.
-Thank you, dear.

1:18:50.397 --> 1:18:53.233
No. Oh, no. No.

1:18:58.739 --> 1:18:59.740
Look, this is--

1:19:00.741 --> 1:19:01.909
This is good.

1:19:03.202 --> 1:19:04.786
There's a lesson in there, you know?

1:19:04.870 --> 1:19:07.539
If you're gonna run for office,
your past is fair game.

1:19:07.623 --> 1:19:10.667
He posted that when he was in sixth grade,
you butt crack.

1:19:10.751 --> 1:19:12.169
-Look, I--
-He was 11.

1:19:12.252 --> 1:19:13.921
I don't want
anything to happen to the kid, okay?

1:19:14.004 --> 1:19:14.838
I'm not a monster.

1:19:14.922 --> 1:19:16.882
Look, what about all the people
that took the clickbait?

1:19:17.382 --> 1:19:18.383
What about those people?

1:19:18.467 --> 1:19:20.802
-Good. Yes. Good.
-All right. This is on them.

1:19:20.886 --> 1:19:24.306
-What's good?
-This inner turmoil. Let that get in you.

1:19:24.389 --> 1:19:27.184
-Come on. This where real change begins.
-No.

1:19:29.436 --> 1:19:31.813
Can we re-cue CPM-163, please?

1:19:31.897 --> 1:19:34.608
-What's CPM-163?
-No, I know it's very unusual.

1:19:35.192 --> 1:19:39.696
Please, we need to go back
to Christmas Past's Memory 163.

1:19:39.780 --> 1:19:40.739
What is that?

1:19:40.822 --> 1:19:43.534
Thank you, Bonnie. No,
I don't wanna hear about it right n--

1:19:47.412 --> 1:19:48.372
Thank you, Patrick.

1:19:50.040 --> 1:19:52.000
Stay with me, Clint. Stay in it.

1:19:52.626 --> 1:19:54.127
Oh, come on. Don't do this.

1:19:55.212 --> 1:19:57.589
No, it's okay. I'm here with you.

1:19:57.673 --> 1:19:59.424
Please don't do this. Come on, man. I--

1:19:59.508 --> 1:20:01.468
You can do it. Come on.

1:20:03.011 --> 1:20:04.513
I'm here with you the whole way.

1:20:08.517 --> 1:20:10.644
Hey, guys. Hey, Wrenny.

1:20:10.727 --> 1:20:11.895
Look what Uncle Clint got ya.

1:20:11.979 --> 1:20:15.107
Cool.
Mom, can I donate it to the sick kids?

1:20:15.190 --> 1:20:17.067
That would be really nice, sweetheart.

1:20:17.150 --> 1:20:19.903
-There's a bin down in the lobby, okay?
-Yeah, give it away.

1:20:19.987 --> 1:20:20.821
Glad we wrapped it.

1:20:20.904 --> 1:20:22.990
It's next to the teddy bear, okay?
Have Martha help you.

1:20:23.740 --> 1:20:26.535
Well, you're certainly looking brighter
than you were before.

1:20:26.618 --> 1:20:27.911
Clint, don't.

1:20:28.620 --> 1:20:33.000
Before she comes back, listen.
It's time that I made some arrangements.

1:20:34.001 --> 1:20:37.045
Okay. Stop it.

1:20:37.129 --> 1:20:40.632
I need to ask you a favor,
and it's a doozy.

1:20:42.593 --> 1:20:46.180
When I'm gone, I'd like you to take Wren.

1:20:46.805 --> 1:20:47.931
Okay.

1:20:49.433 --> 1:20:51.935
Okay, stop. You're not gonna go anywhere.

1:20:52.728 --> 1:20:55.981
You know, even if you did,
which you're not.

1:20:56.064 --> 1:20:58.317
Okay, I'm not the dad type.

1:20:58.901 --> 1:21:00.652
I'm really not. You know, I'm crazy busy

1:21:00.736 --> 1:21:03.488
and I'm, you know… selfish.

1:21:03.572 --> 1:21:07.576
Clint, you don't fool me.
I know who you are underneath all of that.

1:21:07.659 --> 1:21:09.912
That's where you've always
been wrong about me.

1:21:09.995 --> 1:21:11.663
I really am this selfish.

1:21:12.247 --> 1:21:13.957
Bad news, Carrie.

1:21:14.041 --> 1:21:18.086
They were out of vegan stuff downstairs
so I just got you a chicken noodle.

1:21:18.170 --> 1:21:20.714
But I picked out all the chicken bits,
so it should be good.

1:21:20.797 --> 1:21:22.007
-Hey, Owen.
-Hey.

1:21:24.426 --> 1:21:26.762
Our sister has something
that she wants to ask you. It's a favor.

1:21:26.845 --> 1:21:30.182
I think, if you could just hear it
with an open mind and make me proud, okay?

1:21:30.265 --> 1:21:31.517
-Yeah.
-I'm sorry.

1:21:38.357 --> 1:21:39.816
Hey, Carrie.

1:21:43.487 --> 1:21:44.488
What do you need?

1:21:45.531 --> 1:21:47.074
Anything in the whole wide world.

1:21:47.950 --> 1:21:51.286
-We're family. I'll do anything for you.
-Thank you, Owen.

1:21:53.163 --> 1:21:56.375
Hey. I know that wasn't easy.

1:21:57.292 --> 1:22:01.004
But you faced it and that took guts
and I'm proud of you. Come here.

1:22:02.548 --> 1:22:03.549
Yeah.

1:22:03.632 --> 1:22:06.260
Ease up. That's enough.
You're gonna get ectoplasm all over me.

1:22:06.343 --> 1:22:09.304
All right.
Your final ghost will be right with you.

1:22:09.805 --> 1:22:14.101
Now, he's a little imposing.
Doesn't say much. Mostly points at stuff.

1:22:14.184 --> 1:22:16.687
Wait. Hold-- That's it? You're leaving?

1:22:17.938 --> 1:22:20.858
Well, yeah. My part of the haunt is over.

1:22:22.025 --> 1:22:25.237
But don't worry. You're gonna do great.

1:22:26.113 --> 1:22:28.407
No. Hold on.

1:22:28.490 --> 1:22:30.617
You don't get to make me relive
the worst moment of my life

1:22:30.701 --> 1:22:32.244
and then just F-O. What about you?

1:22:32.744 --> 1:22:34.538
I faced my kicker. Now it's your turn.

1:22:34.621 --> 1:22:37.583
Clint, how many times
do I have to tell you? It's not about me.

1:22:38.083 --> 1:22:39.459
Oh, well, then good afternoon.

1:22:39.543 --> 1:22:42.045
Uh-uh. Oh, no.
You know I find that triggering.

1:22:42.129 --> 1:22:43.463
-That's why I said it.
-Take that down a notch.

1:22:43.547 --> 1:22:45.299
Who are you to tell anyone
how to live their life

1:22:45.382 --> 1:22:48.719
when you're busy running away
from your own? Just admit it.

1:22:48.802 --> 1:22:51.471
All right. No, that'll do.
Not another word.

1:22:51.555 --> 1:22:54.641
-Let's get you back to the office before--
-No shame in admitting you're afraid.

1:22:54.725 --> 1:22:57.436
Oh, yeah? What is it I'm so afraid of?

1:22:57.519 --> 1:22:59.271
You're afraid of that one question.

1:22:59.771 --> 1:23:00.939
What's he on about?

1:23:01.857 --> 1:23:03.901
I don't-- I have no idea.

1:23:03.984 --> 1:23:04.985
Sure you do.

1:23:06.820 --> 1:23:08.739
It's the question
that keeps you up at night.

1:23:09.740 --> 1:23:13.493
Keeps you working here
year after year, after year,

1:23:13.577 --> 1:23:15.245
when you could be alive again.

1:23:18.207 --> 1:23:21.335
Oh, no. There is no call
for singing. Now come on. Let's--

1:23:21.418 --> 1:23:24.963
Doesn't matter how many people you change,
no matter how much good you do.

1:23:25.047 --> 1:23:26.965
You still don't know the answer.

1:23:28.175 --> 1:23:29.343
The answer to what?

1:23:37.267 --> 1:23:40.145
Am I forever

1:23:42.022 --> 1:23:43.941
Unredeemable?

1:23:44.650 --> 1:23:48.237
Why, that's preposterous.
You were redeemed. I was there.

1:23:48.320 --> 1:23:51.823
But can I ever overcome

1:23:52.699 --> 1:23:54.701
All the wrongs I'm running from?

1:23:54.785 --> 1:23:57.120
That was all so long ago.

1:23:57.204 --> 1:23:59.790
You've more than made up
for all that by now.

1:23:59.873 --> 1:24:02.543
Can my worst be left behind

1:24:02.626 --> 1:24:05.254
And do I deserve to find

1:24:05.337 --> 1:24:09.967
There's a soul
Who could see any good in me

1:24:12.803 --> 1:24:16.265
Or will I only ever be

1:24:18.183 --> 1:24:20.185
Unredeemable?

1:24:22.771 --> 1:24:24.690
There's only one way to find out, boys.

1:24:25.440 --> 1:24:27.276
He takes his retirement right now.

1:24:27.359 --> 1:24:29.236
All right. That's enough. Back to bed.

1:24:29.319 --> 1:24:30.529
Oh, no.

1:24:47.171 --> 1:24:51.675
Spent every waking minute
Taking all that I could take

1:24:52.885 --> 1:24:56.930
Never stopped to reckon
With the ruin in my wake

1:24:58.348 --> 1:25:03.228
With all the bridges that I burned
The wounds I didn't mend

1:25:03.312 --> 1:25:07.983
All the worth I thought I earned
It turned worthless in the end

1:25:09.234 --> 1:25:10.235
What's going on?

1:25:10.986 --> 1:25:12.446
What was it for?

1:25:15.949 --> 1:25:17.576
Well, is it possible

1:25:17.659 --> 1:25:23.165
I'm meant for something more?

1:25:23.248 --> 1:25:27.794
Am I forever unredeemable?

1:25:29.213 --> 1:25:35.010
Can I be a man who breaks
From a lifetime of mistakes?

1:25:35.594 --> 1:25:40.474
Can my worst be left behind
And do I deserve to find

1:25:40.557 --> 1:25:43.477
A kind of love that I can lean on

1:25:43.560 --> 1:25:46.897
Every day

1:25:46.980 --> 1:25:50.567
Or will I learn I have to stay

1:25:51.151 --> 1:25:53.904
Unredeemable?

1:25:53.987 --> 1:25:55.781
Listen well, Ebenezer.

1:25:55.864 --> 1:26:00.327
Unredeemable

1:26:00.410 --> 1:26:04.331
You will be visited by three spirits.

1:26:05.165 --> 1:26:07.292
You're wasting your time, Jacob.

1:26:17.177 --> 1:26:18.220
Are you sure?

1:26:26.812 --> 1:26:28.355
Come on, big guy.

1:26:29.940 --> 1:26:34.236
We have to believe
Inside the worst of us

1:26:34.319 --> 1:26:39.199
-There is some decency there
-Decency there

1:26:39.283 --> 1:26:44.371
You know that you can achieve
Something miraculous

1:26:44.872 --> 1:26:46.915
If you'd only dare

1:26:46.999 --> 1:26:49.334
-If you dare
-If you dare

1:26:49.418 --> 1:26:54.590
I have to go, I have to try

1:26:54.673 --> 1:26:56.008
That's how I'll know

1:26:56.091 --> 1:26:59.344
Know if I'm

1:26:59.428 --> 1:27:04.183
-Forever unredeemable
-Unredeemable

1:27:04.266 --> 1:27:09.521
If I'll ever be someone
Who makes up for all they've done

1:27:09.605 --> 1:27:13.901
-Or is all I am unlovable?
-Unlovable

1:27:13.984 --> 1:27:16.695
Am I someone someone can forgive?

1:27:16.778 --> 1:27:20.866
Can I take the leap and live?

1:27:20.949 --> 1:27:23.535
There's a lot I leave behind

1:27:23.619 --> 1:27:27.122
But I gotta go and find if it's true

1:27:27.206 --> 1:27:30.959
-That there is truly good in me
-Truly good

1:27:31.043 --> 1:27:36.465
And maybe see that I won't always be

1:27:36.548 --> 1:27:41.094
-Unredeemable
-Unredeemable

1:27:41.178 --> 1:27:42.638
Am I unredeemable?

1:27:42.721 --> 1:27:46.475
Can you redeem the unredeemable?

1:27:46.558 --> 1:27:52.981
Unredeemable

1:28:03.867 --> 1:28:04.868
What is this?

1:28:05.452 --> 1:28:07.079
-What's what?
-Wait, am I…

1:28:08.539 --> 1:28:09.540
I think so.

1:28:09.623 --> 1:28:11.124
You're warm.

1:28:12.709 --> 1:28:14.545
Yes! I'm warm.

1:28:15.504 --> 1:28:16.505
What's wrong?

1:28:16.588 --> 1:28:17.673
-Itch.
-What?

1:28:17.756 --> 1:28:19.299
-Itch. I got-- Do you mind?
-Okay.

1:28:20.551 --> 1:28:23.262
-Okay. All right.
-Yeah. To the right?

1:28:23.345 --> 1:28:24.805
Pajamas are made of burlap.

1:28:24.888 --> 1:28:26.348
Can you get into my sleeping gown?

1:28:26.431 --> 1:28:28.559
-Just--
-No. God, I would rather not.

1:28:28.642 --> 1:28:29.893
Please, I beg of you.

1:28:29.977 --> 1:28:33.730
-Oh, yes! Oh, that's terrific.
-Okay. There we go. That's it.

1:28:33.814 --> 1:28:37.025
-Oh, mommy.
-Okay.

1:28:37.109 --> 1:28:38.360
-That feels so good.
-Yep.

1:28:38.443 --> 1:28:40.195
I forgot what it's like
to scratch an itch.

1:28:40.279 --> 1:28:42.948
I forgot what it was like to feel this way
about my hand.

1:28:43.615 --> 1:28:44.616
Thank you.

1:28:48.704 --> 1:28:50.998
Wow. Why am I so heavy?

1:28:51.081 --> 1:28:54.084
-Gravity.
-Yeah.

1:28:55.252 --> 1:28:56.795
Oh, my…

1:28:57.921 --> 1:29:00.090
-You have…
-Indoor plumbing.

1:29:01.091 --> 1:29:02.885
-Could I?
-You may.

1:29:10.058 --> 1:29:11.143
Careful.

1:29:12.686 --> 1:29:14.563
This is amazing!

1:29:15.272 --> 1:29:19.943
I have always wondered what this
would be like and it does not disappoint.

1:29:21.528 --> 1:29:23.947
Hey! What's conditioner?

1:29:24.448 --> 1:29:26.783
Well, you wanna use that on your head.

1:29:27.743 --> 1:29:28.785
Too late!

1:29:29.286 --> 1:29:32.122
-Can I do this every month?
-Sure.

1:29:32.206 --> 1:29:35.709
Look out, New York City.
This guy showers once a month!

1:29:40.172 --> 1:29:42.883
Your clothes are really too tight on me.
I feel silly.

1:29:42.966 --> 1:29:44.468
No, you look fine. Come on.

1:29:44.551 --> 1:29:46.053
Hey, look at this guy!

1:29:47.221 --> 1:29:50.891
Jacket. Slacks. Little pocket square.

1:29:50.974 --> 1:29:53.310
No, don't. Put that back, please.
Thank you. He can--

1:29:54.102 --> 1:29:56.104
-He can see me. You can see me.
-Yes, he can.

1:29:56.188 --> 1:29:58.357
-Yeah, I can see you.
-He can see you very well, I think.

1:29:58.440 --> 1:30:01.068
You're gonna wanna get used to that.
Really you are.

1:30:01.151 --> 1:30:02.486
-Everyone can see me.
-Yes.

1:30:02.569 --> 1:30:04.196
Hello! You can see me!

1:30:04.821 --> 1:30:07.115
-You're gonna wanna get used to that too.
-Man.

1:30:07.616 --> 1:30:08.992
Are you okay?

1:30:09.076 --> 1:30:11.245
-Think so. He's fine.
-I think so. Yeah.

1:30:11.828 --> 1:30:14.915
-You look stupid.
-You look stupid.

1:30:14.998 --> 1:30:16.792
No. Hey, Dave, back off.

1:30:16.875 --> 1:30:19.419
-Okay. Will you just get it together?
-Well, no, he looked stupid.

1:30:19.503 --> 1:30:21.380
-There she is. Let's go talk to her and--
-Oh, no. That's her.

1:30:21.463 --> 1:30:22.631
You know what? Here's the thing.

1:30:24.049 --> 1:30:26.301
Let's just put a pin in it, okay?

1:30:27.553 --> 1:30:29.096
I don't know what to say to her.

1:30:29.179 --> 1:30:30.931
What do you mean?
You were doing great before.

1:30:31.014 --> 1:30:32.224
Just do more of that.

1:30:32.724 --> 1:30:35.727
Yeah, but that's when she was
a fantasy. And now she's real.

1:30:36.311 --> 1:30:37.354
I'm gonna screw it up.

1:30:37.938 --> 1:30:39.982
Look, I think I made a big mistake, okay?

1:30:40.065 --> 1:30:41.817
I'm not ready for any of this.

1:30:41.900 --> 1:30:43.777
I used way too much water in the shower.

1:30:44.278 --> 1:30:47.406
I mean, is that who I am here?
The guy who hogs all the hot water?

1:30:47.489 --> 1:30:49.074
-Hey, check it out.
-What?

1:30:53.203 --> 1:30:54.204
That was fantastic.

1:30:54.288 --> 1:30:58.500
Yeah. Get it together.
Enough with the buyer's remorse.

1:30:58.584 --> 1:31:00.294
Hey, you made the right decision.

1:31:00.377 --> 1:31:03.005
Don't think. Deep breath.

1:31:03.755 --> 1:31:06.466
Go get her. Now.
Before she gets away. Trust me.

1:31:08.510 --> 1:31:10.012
-Okay.
-Okay.

1:31:12.014 --> 1:31:14.516
-I will slap your head off.
-No. I'll go talk to her.

1:31:14.600 --> 1:31:15.934
I will. I promise.

1:31:16.602 --> 1:31:20.189
The next ghost…
The future's always in flux.

1:31:20.272 --> 1:31:25.110
I don't know what you're gonna see,
but just hear the guy out. All right?

1:31:25.194 --> 1:31:27.946
-I mean, you asked me why I chose you.
-I know why you did.

1:31:28.030 --> 1:31:31.617
Because I can be a positive force
for mankind, or whatever.

1:31:31.700 --> 1:31:34.203
No. Well, yes. At first.

1:31:35.204 --> 1:31:38.123
But then when I found out
you were unredeemable, like me,

1:31:39.499 --> 1:31:45.464
I thought, "If I can change this guy,
maybe there's hope for me too."

1:31:55.265 --> 1:31:56.517
Yeah.

1:31:57.184 --> 1:31:58.185
Kimberly?

1:31:58.894 --> 1:32:05.025
Hey. You're back.
And in a boldly tight suit.

1:32:05.108 --> 1:32:07.361
Yeah. It is a little snug.

1:32:07.444 --> 1:32:12.699
No, I like it. It's kind of
a Euro-fit. And I like it on you.

1:32:12.783 --> 1:32:17.120
Yeah, it is a Euro-fit,
because I buy all my clothes in Germany.

1:32:17.204 --> 1:32:19.164
-Yeah.
-I can see.

1:32:21.208 --> 1:32:23.794
Sorry, but would you--

1:32:24.628 --> 1:32:28.006
Would you wanna go somewhere
and maybe, I don't…

1:32:28.090 --> 1:32:30.676
-No, you don't even have to answer--
-No, I would love to-- Yeah.

1:32:30.759 --> 1:32:33.136
-I would love to.
-Great. Really?

1:32:33.220 --> 1:32:36.974
-Totally. I love "somewhere."
-Yeah, me too. Oh, my gosh.

1:32:37.057 --> 1:32:38.308
What?

1:32:39.434 --> 1:32:41.436
What is it? An itch?

1:32:42.062 --> 1:32:43.063
Here, let me help you.

1:32:43.981 --> 1:32:44.982
-Where? Right there?
-Yeah.

1:32:45.065 --> 1:32:46.149
That's a choice.

1:32:47.609 --> 1:32:49.111
That is heaven on a stick.

1:32:50.153 --> 1:32:51.154
Thank you.

1:32:51.238 --> 1:32:52.823
There's a place
called "Heaven on a Stick."

1:32:52.906 --> 1:32:55.284
-It serves corn dogs, but, I mean, it…
-Okay.

1:32:55.367 --> 1:32:57.536
-It's food, right?
-It's delicious.

1:33:13.844 --> 1:33:15.512
-Hey, Sydney.
-Hey, Clint.

1:33:15.596 --> 1:33:17.181
Hey, how you doin'?

1:33:20.309 --> 1:33:22.728
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

1:33:23.478 --> 1:33:24.479
Hey, Stuart.

1:33:25.272 --> 1:33:26.523
Come on!

1:33:38.827 --> 1:33:40.412
This is beautiful.

1:33:41.038 --> 1:33:44.875
So, you just decided one day

1:33:44.958 --> 1:33:46.752
that you're gonna quit your job,

1:33:47.252 --> 1:33:48.921
leave it all behind, and move here?

1:33:49.505 --> 1:33:53.800
Well, every year I'd say,
"It's time to move on."

1:33:54.843 --> 1:33:56.637
And then every year, I chose to stay.

1:33:57.221 --> 1:33:59.556
And our choices make us who we are,
don't they?

1:34:00.474 --> 1:34:03.268
Yeah. Guess they do.

1:34:03.352 --> 1:34:06.355
So this year, I chose something else.

1:34:06.438 --> 1:34:09.441
Honestly,
I'm worried I made a huge mistake.

1:34:09.525 --> 1:34:14.321
But, I mean, if I hadn't,
I wouldn't be here with you.

1:34:20.077 --> 1:34:21.078
Is that okay?

1:34:26.917 --> 1:34:30.212
The city is sparkling
With twinkling lights

1:34:30.712 --> 1:34:34.174
It's one of those magic
"Manhattan-y" nights

1:34:34.258 --> 1:34:37.803
Can't tell what comes next
He's sure taking it slow

1:34:37.886 --> 1:34:42.391
But he's holding my hand
And he's not letting go

1:34:42.975 --> 1:34:46.103
He's goofy, he's tall
He's got a good heart

1:34:46.186 --> 1:34:50.315
But I don't wanna fall
And have it all fall apart

1:34:50.399 --> 1:34:51.817
I look in his eyes

1:34:51.900 --> 1:34:56.613
And they keep saying
"Leap and the net will appear"

1:34:57.239 --> 1:34:59.491
So why not dive in

1:34:59.575 --> 1:35:03.912
'Cause a brand new beginning
Feels long overdue

1:35:03.996 --> 1:35:07.207
That's the view from here

1:35:09.710 --> 1:35:13.046
That's the view from here

1:35:15.048 --> 1:35:17.050
They said it's supposed to snow tonight.

1:35:17.134 --> 1:35:19.344
Really? Doesn't feel cold enough.

1:35:20.012 --> 1:35:21.305
Not cold at all.

1:35:23.223 --> 1:35:24.975
How wet are my armpits?

1:35:25.058 --> 1:35:26.768
How red is my face?

1:35:27.269 --> 1:35:30.522
When I used to date
Holding hands was third base

1:35:30.606 --> 1:35:32.524
I think there's a spark

1:35:32.608 --> 1:35:34.443
Could this thing become real?

1:35:34.526 --> 1:35:39.656
Could it possibly be
That she might feel like I feel?

1:35:41.074 --> 1:35:44.828
This woman's as kind
As a human could be

1:35:44.912 --> 1:35:48.373
So why would she wind up
With someone like me?

1:35:48.457 --> 1:35:51.251
And what if we find out, in time

1:35:51.335 --> 1:35:54.546
Maybe I'm that same jerk like I fear?

1:35:56.089 --> 1:35:59.635
'Cause the man that I see
Could so easily be

1:35:59.718 --> 1:36:02.054
Just a Scrooge déjà vu

1:36:02.596 --> 1:36:05.682
That's the view from here

1:36:07.976 --> 1:36:11.522
That's the view from here

1:36:32.084 --> 1:36:35.838
Maybe I haven't lost sight
Of what's right

1:36:35.921 --> 1:36:40.342
'Cause tonight it's so perfectly clear

1:36:41.343 --> 1:36:45.764
Somehow I see who I could be

1:36:45.848 --> 1:36:49.643
Just being with you

1:36:51.270 --> 1:36:57.192
That's the view from here

1:37:00.028 --> 1:37:05.701
That's the view from here

1:37:07.661 --> 1:37:09.997
I don't really buy all my clothes
in Germany.

1:37:41.069 --> 1:37:42.070
All in favor?

1:37:42.738 --> 1:37:43.822
The motion is carried.

1:37:43.906 --> 1:37:46.283
-Well, this is great.
-Community volunteer work will be…

1:37:46.366 --> 1:37:48.994
She did it.
She looks presidential up here.

1:37:49.077 --> 1:37:50.454
Look at her go with her little gavel.

1:37:51.038 --> 1:37:55.501
Next order of business is that all student
fundraising will be overseen by an in…

1:37:57.377 --> 1:37:59.713
…will be overseen by an independent…

1:37:59.796 --> 1:38:00.881
Did you see this?

1:38:02.841 --> 1:38:03.926
What's going on?

1:38:08.138 --> 1:38:09.765
What is it? What does it say?

1:38:23.737 --> 1:38:25.155
What's this supposed to be?

1:38:29.701 --> 1:38:32.913
Wait. What are you telling me? The kid?

1:38:35.958 --> 1:38:38.210
Because of a little online dustup?

1:38:39.878 --> 1:38:42.631
How was I supposed to know
that he would do something like this?

1:39:00.232 --> 1:39:01.441
Wait a minute. Hold on.

1:39:01.525 --> 1:39:03.485
It's just shadows of things to come.

1:39:03.569 --> 1:39:05.529
I mean,
these haven't actually happened yet.

1:39:05.612 --> 1:39:07.489
I'm not gonna turn my life upside down
for you people,

1:39:07.573 --> 1:39:10.158
but this is an easy one.
I can fix this one.

1:39:12.744 --> 1:39:15.330
Let's just cut the tour short, all right?

1:39:16.498 --> 1:39:18.584
You don't speak? You just point at things?

1:39:19.293 --> 1:39:21.795
Why don't you point to the way out, huh?
Is that it? Right there?

1:39:28.719 --> 1:39:29.761
Old me.

1:39:31.054 --> 1:39:32.723
I don't wanna know!

1:39:33.932 --> 1:39:35.225
Come on.

1:39:42.691 --> 1:39:43.692
Yes!

1:39:44.568 --> 1:39:47.654
Yes, I've seen the movies.
I know the drill.

1:39:47.738 --> 1:39:49.531
Here. Here it is.

1:39:50.407 --> 1:39:51.408
Right here. The--

1:39:52.409 --> 1:39:54.203
-93. Not bad.
-I got him.

1:39:54.286 --> 1:39:58.123
Yeah, he jumped ahead to YTC-407.
Pretty sure he was looking for me. Sorry.

1:39:58.207 --> 1:39:59.958
-Hey, it's you.
-Yeah.

1:40:00.042 --> 1:40:02.127
Listen, can you please help me
get the hell out of here?

1:40:02.211 --> 1:40:04.463
Don't get all clingy, okay?
I'm at work right now.

1:40:04.546 --> 1:40:06.298
I knew you'd get too attached.
I knew this--

1:40:07.090 --> 1:40:08.383
Here he is. Hey, over here.

1:40:18.060 --> 1:40:19.186
You good?

1:40:21.480 --> 1:40:23.440
Yes, dude, I see it.

1:40:23.524 --> 1:40:26.109
It's so disturbing.
I'm so sad. Are we done? Can I go?

1:40:29.363 --> 1:40:31.073
-You all right?
-Are you trying to talk?

1:40:32.699 --> 1:40:34.535
It's so sad.
Look what you've driven him to.

1:40:38.747 --> 1:40:39.790
You ruined everything!

1:40:39.873 --> 1:40:41.333
Oh, my God, you did it.

1:40:41.416 --> 1:40:42.334
That's what he sounds like?

1:40:44.378 --> 1:40:46.880
-You made my best friend quit!
-Yeah!

1:40:46.964 --> 1:40:51.593
No! I did not. That was his choice.
And frankly, I'm proud of him.

1:40:51.677 --> 1:40:53.512
That's why I'ma kick your ass.

1:40:57.015 --> 1:40:59.017
You been Christmas Caroled, bitch!

1:41:02.604 --> 1:41:05.148
I'm back. What time is it?

1:41:05.816 --> 1:41:06.817
4:15.

1:41:06.900 --> 1:41:08.610
4:15. Good. Thank God.

1:41:08.694 --> 1:41:11.405
There's still time. I gotta find my phone.
Where's my phone?

1:41:11.488 --> 1:41:14.283
Hey, I think I have
moderate to severe Crohn's disease.

1:41:14.783 --> 1:41:17.286
No, you don't. Stop watching that.

1:41:17.870 --> 1:41:19.496
God, you look like hell.

1:41:19.580 --> 1:41:21.707
I know. It's just, I--

1:41:21.790 --> 1:41:23.750
Wait, did you see your future?

1:41:23.834 --> 1:41:25.377
-Did it change you?
-No!

1:41:25.460 --> 1:41:28.463
No. There's just one little wrinkle
I need to iron out.

1:41:28.547 --> 1:41:31.133
-Where the hell is my phone?
-You mean this phone?

1:41:31.216 --> 1:41:34.052
No, I don't know her number.
Like I know anyone's number.

1:41:34.136 --> 1:41:36.680
-It's 12 blocks. We're gonna walk.
-Wait. What's going on?

1:41:36.763 --> 1:41:39.141
-What-- What'd you see?
-Nothing. It's fine.

1:41:39.224 --> 1:41:41.518
I just think it's better if Wren
doesn't post the video, that's all.

1:41:41.602 --> 1:41:42.728
What happens if she posts it?

1:41:42.811 --> 1:41:43.937
-Something bad?
-Oh, come on!

1:41:44.438 --> 1:41:46.273
What-- What'd ya… see?

1:41:46.356 --> 1:41:49.067
Oh, God. That's still kinda thrilling.

1:41:53.614 --> 1:41:55.282
Clint, wait up.

1:41:55.365 --> 1:41:56.575
You don't have to come.

1:41:57.075 --> 1:41:58.785
You seem very passionate about this.

1:41:58.869 --> 1:42:00.370
Are you sure you haven't changed?

1:42:00.454 --> 1:42:03.290
No, I didn't.
Will you quit asking me that?

1:42:03.373 --> 1:42:04.791
Clint, please slow down!

1:42:06.752 --> 1:42:10.464
Oh, boy! Did your head make that clang?

1:42:10.547 --> 1:42:12.174
That was so loud.

1:42:12.925 --> 1:42:14.301
That's gotta be a concussion.

1:42:14.384 --> 1:42:17.554
-No.
-Okay. Here we go. All right, easy.

1:42:18.347 --> 1:42:19.973
Are we going back up?
Did you forget something?

1:42:20.474 --> 1:42:21.475
No? Okay.

1:42:21.558 --> 1:42:22.893
-I don't know.
-All right.

1:42:24.728 --> 1:42:27.064
Sir, could we please
speed it up a little? Thank you.

1:42:27.147 --> 1:42:30.567
Hey, what's going on?
Did you see something in your future?

1:42:30.651 --> 1:42:33.278
It's no big deal. I--
Hey, how did it go with Kimberly?

1:42:34.321 --> 1:42:35.364
Terrible.

1:42:36.031 --> 1:42:40.035
We walked all over Manhattan
and talked and connected and…

1:42:41.578 --> 1:42:44.331
we even kissed. On the lips.

1:42:45.415 --> 1:42:47.876
How is this ter-- That sounds amazing.

1:42:47.960 --> 1:42:51.421
It was. She is.
She just doesn't know who I am.

1:42:51.505 --> 1:42:54.800
Oh, my God.
Will you quit with the unredeemable crap?

1:42:54.883 --> 1:42:56.677
You just haven't dated
in a few hundred years.

1:42:56.760 --> 1:42:58.762
Driver!
This is a matter of life and death here.

1:42:58.846 --> 1:43:01.181
-Can we kick it in the ass?
-You got it.

1:43:03.183 --> 1:43:05.561
"Life and death"?
I thought you said it was no big deal.

1:43:13.569 --> 1:43:15.404
Hey, good afternoon, gentlemen.

1:43:15.487 --> 1:43:17.155
-You wanna go, wiseass?
-No, I--

1:43:17.239 --> 1:43:22.077
Hey! It doesn't mean that anymore! Hey!

1:43:22.160 --> 1:43:23.370
-Sorry!
-Hey!

1:43:23.453 --> 1:43:25.330
-Sorry!
-Jesus!

1:43:27.124 --> 1:43:29.960
You know, when they were doing my future,
there was this little sick kid.

1:43:30.460 --> 1:43:32.212
-What did they call him?
-It was Tiny Tim.

1:43:32.296 --> 1:43:34.965
-No. Sweet kid. One crutch.
-No.

1:43:35.048 --> 1:43:37.092
-Little Larry.
-No. Tiny Tim.

1:43:37.176 --> 1:43:39.678
-Pretty sure it was Little Larry. Anyway…
-Pretty sure it was Tiny Tim.

1:43:39.761 --> 1:43:42.890
…in my future, Little Larry was dead,
and it was my fault.

1:43:42.973 --> 1:43:45.559
Cratchit needed money for an operation,
and I was just too stingy.

1:43:45.642 --> 1:43:46.810
It was Tiny Tim!

1:43:47.436 --> 1:43:50.397
You killed Tiny Tim, okay?

1:43:50.939 --> 1:43:52.733
Micro Michael? Super-small Steve.

1:43:52.816 --> 1:43:55.068
Holy sh--

1:43:55.152 --> 1:43:57.696
I like tiny. Teensy Tim?

1:43:57.779 --> 1:43:59.865
Wait. Itsy Witsy Isaac.

1:44:08.290 --> 1:44:10.083
Here you go. Merry Christmas.

1:44:10.167 --> 1:44:11.335
Where is she? Come on.

1:44:12.461 --> 1:44:14.713
Sh-- Wrenny?

1:44:15.422 --> 1:44:16.590
There.

1:44:17.299 --> 1:44:19.218
Uncle Owen! Are you okay?

1:44:19.927 --> 1:44:21.470
How do you never get better at this?

1:44:21.553 --> 1:44:22.846
She posts it right after he fell.

1:44:23.514 --> 1:44:25.807
You should post it.
Might be a vote-getter.

1:44:36.068 --> 1:44:37.569
-Clint.
-I need to talk to Wren.

1:44:37.653 --> 1:44:39.696
Wait. Before you talk to her, just--

1:44:39.780 --> 1:44:40.906
This is important.

1:44:41.490 --> 1:44:42.407
Right in the concussion.

1:44:43.033 --> 1:44:44.409
Clint, come on. She's posting.

1:44:46.370 --> 1:44:47.496
Come on.

1:44:48.872 --> 1:44:50.040
No.

1:44:52.042 --> 1:44:54.503
Oh, Kimberly, you have no idea
what you've just done.

1:44:54.586 --> 1:44:59.174
I did what I should've done the minute
you asked me to dig up dirt on a child.

1:45:00.342 --> 1:45:03.804
I told Wren that her choices
make her who she is.

1:45:05.222 --> 1:45:08.267
And you know what? So do mine.

1:45:09.726 --> 1:45:13.480
'Cause the decent and honest
Young woman

1:45:13.564 --> 1:45:18.026
Well, she's still part of me

1:45:18.110 --> 1:45:21.321
It's taken me years but I finally quit

1:45:21.905 --> 1:45:25.158
There's a line you can't cross
And guess what? This is it

1:45:25.242 --> 1:45:28.745
No, Clint
I haven't lost sight of what's right

1:45:28.829 --> 1:45:32.082
'Cause it's perfectly clear

1:45:32.165 --> 1:45:34.376
Kimberly! I'm sorry to interrupt,

1:45:34.459 --> 1:45:36.170
because you are killing it right now.

1:45:36.253 --> 1:45:38.088
But did Wren post the video or not?

1:45:38.172 --> 1:45:40.632
No, I didn't. I'm sorry. Are you mad?

1:45:40.716 --> 1:45:42.467
-I mean, Kimberly--
-Hold on, you didn't post it?

1:45:42.551 --> 1:45:44.636
-No.
-She didn't post it!

1:45:45.220 --> 1:45:47.472
Because you're good like your mom.

1:45:47.556 --> 1:45:48.557
You--

1:45:48.640 --> 1:45:51.018
-Yeah.
-I don't do hugging very well.

1:45:51.101 --> 1:45:52.644
Oh, screw it. Come here, Kimberly.

1:45:53.312 --> 1:45:55.731
Thank you. You have no idea
the good that you've done.

1:45:55.814 --> 1:45:57.941
-Great, are we doing hugs? Come here.
-Owen. Okay, listen--

1:45:58.025 --> 1:45:59.943
Hold on, just let me get this out first,
okay?

1:46:00.027 --> 1:46:03.447
Look, I know I don't say this enough,
and you don't have to say it back…

1:46:03.530 --> 1:46:04.740
I love you, too.

1:46:05.824 --> 1:46:07.868
That's it. That's what I was gonna say.

1:46:08.911 --> 1:46:10.579
-Bring it in. Okay.
-Yeah.

1:46:11.872 --> 1:46:15.667
Okay. You win the hug.
Good stuff. That was fun.

1:46:15.751 --> 1:46:17.377
Oh, boy, that's a relief.

1:46:17.461 --> 1:46:19.171
Okay. Get ready.

1:46:19.254 --> 1:46:20.255
Get ready.

1:46:20.339 --> 1:46:22.466
'Cause something very special's
about to happen.

1:46:22.549 --> 1:46:25.093
Just hang on.
No. You guys won't be able to see it.

1:46:25.177 --> 1:46:26.678
Only he can see it.
I wish you could see it!

1:46:26.762 --> 1:46:28.555
-Only he can see it. Yeah.
-That would be amazing.

1:46:28.639 --> 1:46:30.557
You know what,
just excuse us for just one second.

1:46:30.641 --> 1:46:34.061
-Love it. Love it, right?
-Okay. Hey. What is going on?

1:46:34.144 --> 1:46:36.605
I don't know why this isn't happen--

1:46:36.688 --> 1:46:37.814
I mean, you've changed.

1:46:37.898 --> 1:46:40.484
There's supposed to be singing.
It's the big climax.

1:46:40.567 --> 1:46:43.028
-Marley!
-I told you, I didn't change.

1:46:43.111 --> 1:46:44.154
Marley?

1:46:44.238 --> 1:46:46.573
I just took back one dick move.

1:46:46.657 --> 1:46:48.825
No.

1:46:48.909 --> 1:46:51.578
You were about to prove
that unredeemables really can change.

1:46:51.662 --> 1:46:54.081
You rushed down here to help a kid.

1:46:54.164 --> 1:46:56.250
You told your brother that you loved him.

1:46:56.333 --> 1:46:58.752
-I love you so hard, man.
-Thank--

1:46:58.836 --> 1:47:00.712
If you say it too much, it loses its…

1:47:01.213 --> 1:47:03.549
Why isn't this happening? Come on.

1:47:03.632 --> 1:47:05.676
Probably 'cause I'm gonna go back
to work next week

1:47:05.759 --> 1:47:07.427
and I'm gonna keep doing what I do.

1:47:11.723 --> 1:47:14.476
I'll feel guilty for a couple of days,
but then I'll rationalize it.

1:47:15.060 --> 1:47:18.313
I'm really good at that.
I have a talent for it.

1:47:21.108 --> 1:47:24.319
I'm sorry, but it's not like
I wasn't aboveboard about all this.

1:47:33.245 --> 1:47:36.707
-Roberto!
-He's having a weird day, all right?

1:47:36.790 --> 1:47:37.791
I'm gonna go get him.

1:47:37.875 --> 1:47:40.544
We'll rent some skates and stuff
and we'll have a good time.

1:47:40.627 --> 1:47:43.881
-Right back.
-You do know I quit, right?

1:47:47.092 --> 1:47:49.428
Hey! Where ya going?

1:47:50.637 --> 1:47:51.722
I gotta go back.

1:47:52.222 --> 1:47:53.974
Back? Can you even go back?

1:47:54.683 --> 1:47:57.394
Clint, just let me go.
You don't wanna be around for this.

1:47:57.477 --> 1:47:59.521
What do you mean by that?
Hey. Hold on a second.

1:47:59.605 --> 1:48:01.315
What are you gonna do? Are you crazy?

1:48:01.398 --> 1:48:03.609
It's still Christmas. There's still time.

1:48:04.401 --> 1:48:06.862
I'll go back and
we'll figure something out,

1:48:06.945 --> 1:48:08.906
and you'll change.

1:48:09.531 --> 1:48:11.617
People don't change.

1:48:11.700 --> 1:48:12.868
This isn't about me anymore.

1:48:12.951 --> 1:48:15.704
This is about you running away
from your life again.

1:48:15.787 --> 1:48:17.497
All right.
Look, you're here, you're human.

1:48:17.581 --> 1:48:21.084
Hey. Besides,
I thought that we were really becoming…

1:48:21.668 --> 1:48:24.213
-Becoming what?
-I thought we were becoming,

1:48:24.296 --> 1:48:25.589
you know.

1:48:26.465 --> 1:48:29.510
-Bros?
-Yeah.

1:48:29.593 --> 1:48:31.929
I was gonna say friends, but bros.

1:48:32.012 --> 1:48:35.140
Yeah. I just--
Look, if you're not feeling that, and th--

1:48:35.224 --> 1:48:37.434
No. I am. I--

1:48:37.518 --> 1:48:41.021
I mean,
I didn't wanna assume or make it weird.

1:48:41.104 --> 1:48:42.356
It's not weird.

1:48:42.981 --> 1:48:45.359
Yeah, I feel it. A lot.

1:48:47.819 --> 1:48:49.238
I've never had a bro.

1:48:49.863 --> 1:48:51.031
Well, you got one now.

1:48:54.159 --> 1:48:55.911
And your bro is telling you to calm down

1:48:56.912 --> 1:48:59.373
and come go ice-skating
with your new girlfriend.

1:49:02.125 --> 1:49:03.252
She thinks I'm good.

1:49:03.335 --> 1:49:04.628
Maybe you are.

1:49:05.712 --> 1:49:08.340
-So now people do change?
-No, I don't know.

1:49:09.216 --> 1:49:11.677
I don't know.
Maybe there's no magical quick fix.

1:49:12.719 --> 1:49:15.264
Maybe you gotta put in the work,
you ever think about that?

1:49:15.347 --> 1:49:18.433
You gotta wake up each day,
get out of bed and decide,

1:49:18.517 --> 1:49:22.271
"How 'bout today
I don't wish anyone a good afternoon?"

1:49:31.405 --> 1:49:32.447
Come on.

1:49:42.207 --> 1:49:44.209
Hey! No!

1:50:12.279 --> 1:50:13.488
What did you do?

1:50:14.615 --> 1:50:15.657
I don't know.

1:50:24.583 --> 1:50:27.252
Yes! See?
This is what I was talking about.

1:50:28.670 --> 1:50:30.422
No. Wait. No. Wait, no.

1:50:30.506 --> 1:50:33.217
Really, you got it all wrong. I was just--

1:50:33.300 --> 1:50:35.761
No.

1:50:35.844 --> 1:50:40.682
You just jumped in front of a bus
to save someone you care about.

1:50:44.895 --> 1:50:45.896
My bro.

1:50:45.979 --> 1:50:47.147
Your bro.

1:50:47.231 --> 1:50:50.192
It was just a reflex. I did-- Wait. Did I?

1:50:51.360 --> 1:50:52.444
Are you sure?

1:50:52.945 --> 1:50:55.614
We've been doing this a long time,
Mr. Briggs.

1:50:57.533 --> 1:50:58.867
We're quite sure.

1:51:00.035 --> 1:51:02.621
Okay, then. Let's get some chili!

1:51:03.413 --> 1:51:04.581
Yes!

1:51:06.917 --> 1:51:09.211
We're doing another one?
Is that entirely nec--

1:51:09.294 --> 1:51:12.714
No, it's fine. Go ahead. Okay, go ahead.

1:51:13.465 --> 1:51:17.803
I used to think that I was sure
Of what made people tick

1:51:18.637 --> 1:51:22.975
You strip 'em down right to their core
And find a self-centered prick

1:51:23.475 --> 1:51:26.186
I thought when the push
Came to the shove

1:51:26.270 --> 1:51:28.438
I knew just what I'd do

1:51:28.522 --> 1:51:30.524
I'd put me before you

1:51:31.108 --> 1:51:33.861
-But you didn't.
-Guess I didn't.

1:51:33.944 --> 1:51:38.949
You can be a cynic and a sinner
Who can only see the flaws

1:51:39.032 --> 1:51:43.579
But even if you lost your way
You don't have to stay a lost cause

1:51:45.080 --> 1:51:46.957
So can we do a little good?

1:51:47.958 --> 1:51:49.501
Maybe give a little more?

1:51:50.878 --> 1:51:54.715
Work a little harder than we did
The day before

1:51:55.465 --> 1:51:57.092
It only takes a little good

1:51:58.177 --> 1:52:00.179
And some doing what you can

1:52:01.263 --> 1:52:06.268
Taking every chance to make the choice
To be a better man

1:52:06.351 --> 1:52:07.436
So do a little good

1:52:11.940 --> 1:52:16.195
Well, I have spent each Christmas Day
Obsessed with wrong and right

1:52:16.695 --> 1:52:19.364
You thought change
Could only work one way

1:52:19.448 --> 1:52:21.408
It had to happen in one night

1:52:21.992 --> 1:52:24.494
But now you know, oh, now you know

1:52:24.578 --> 1:52:28.332
The line of good and bad
Is not so clean

1:52:28.415 --> 1:52:32.211
And what we are
Is something in between

1:52:32.294 --> 1:52:34.254
It's an everyday decision

1:52:34.338 --> 1:52:37.132
-Two steps forward
-One step back

1:52:37.216 --> 1:52:42.763
But if you try to do what's right
You're on the right track

1:52:42.846 --> 1:52:47.309
So try to do a little good
Maybe give a little more

1:52:48.310 --> 1:52:51.939
Work a little harder than you did
The day before

1:52:52.022 --> 1:52:53.065
Work a little harder

1:52:53.148 --> 1:52:58.070
It only takes a little good
And some doing what you can

1:52:58.153 --> 1:53:02.991
Taking every chance to make the choice
To help your fellow man

1:53:03.075 --> 1:53:05.244
-So do a little good
-Hey

1:53:05.327 --> 1:53:08.997
Just a little, just a little
Just a little

1:53:09.081 --> 1:53:11.750
Maybe there's no magic wand

1:53:14.044 --> 1:53:16.004
Maybe there's no switch to flip

1:53:19.007 --> 1:53:21.677
Some days you may soar beyond

1:53:23.929 --> 1:53:27.933
Some days you may soar beyond
And some days you start to slip

1:53:29.101 --> 1:53:33.230
You can give the world some good
In the daily give-and-take

1:53:33.313 --> 1:53:38.443
With every ripple, ripple, ripple
That you make

1:53:38.527 --> 1:53:40.445
-Do a little good
-Do a little good

1:53:40.529 --> 1:53:43.574
-Maybe give a little more
-Give a little more

1:53:43.657 --> 1:53:46.034
Work a little harder than you did
The day before

1:53:46.118 --> 1:53:48.203
Doing the world a little good

1:53:48.287 --> 1:53:50.622
-It only takes a little good
-Just a little good

1:53:50.706 --> 1:53:53.250
-And some doing what you can
-Do what you can

1:53:53.333 --> 1:53:58.463
Taking every chance to make the choice
To help your fellow man

1:53:58.547 --> 1:53:59.673
Yeah

1:53:59.756 --> 1:54:02.134
-And whether it's Christmas Day
-Christmas Day

1:54:02.217 --> 1:54:04.511
-Or a random day in May
-Or a day in May

1:54:04.595 --> 1:54:08.432
You're gonna wanna say

1:54:08.515 --> 1:54:11.226
That you tried the best you could

1:54:11.310 --> 1:54:14.104
And a little is enough

1:54:14.188 --> 1:54:18.275
-A little is enough
-A little is enough

1:54:18.358 --> 1:54:20.569
To do a little good, hey!

1:54:21.069 --> 1:54:22.196
Do a little good

1:54:22.279 --> 1:54:23.530
Do a little good

1:54:23.614 --> 1:54:24.615
Do a little good

1:54:24.698 --> 1:54:28.952
Do a little good, give a little more

1:54:29.036 --> 1:54:31.914
Some days you may soar beyond

1:54:31.997 --> 1:54:33.457
-Hey
-Hey

1:54:33.540 --> 1:54:40.422
Do a little good

1:54:42.633 --> 1:54:44.718
-Tiny Tim.
-Thank y--

1:54:50.349 --> 1:54:51.517
Clint.

1:54:53.143 --> 1:54:54.144
Clint!

1:55:03.570 --> 1:55:04.780
Damn it, that hurt.

1:55:05.447 --> 1:55:06.532
What the hell?

1:55:07.407 --> 1:55:08.450
Is it over?

1:55:10.160 --> 1:55:11.954
Sure felt like a finale to me.

1:55:14.164 --> 1:55:15.165
No.

1:55:20.879 --> 1:55:21.880
Hey.

1:55:22.840 --> 1:55:23.841
You gotta be kidding me.

1:55:24.675 --> 1:55:26.301
Why is everyone standing around?

1:55:26.385 --> 1:55:29.096
Wanna do some CPR or something?
Why are they just standing there?

1:55:29.763 --> 1:55:31.557
It's a little beyond CPR, I think.

1:55:32.057 --> 1:55:34.768
I mean, I'm not even sure what's left
to blow into.

1:55:35.435 --> 1:55:37.145
But we were just--
We were singing and dancing.

1:55:38.313 --> 1:55:40.023
We just became bros.

1:55:41.108 --> 1:55:42.693
No, I understand, I do.

1:55:43.652 --> 1:55:49.157
But your sacrifice would have no meaning
if it had no consequence.

1:55:49.241 --> 1:55:54.913
Okay, I get that. But this ending sucks.

1:55:56.164 --> 1:55:57.624
It's not the end, Clint.

1:56:16.268 --> 1:56:18.061
I'm so proud of you.

1:56:30.115 --> 1:56:32.659
It's okay. Don't be scared.

1:56:41.084 --> 1:56:43.462
Wait.

1:56:43.545 --> 1:56:45.339
-Hold on.
-No. Go to the light.

1:56:45.422 --> 1:56:47.549
-No. Just one second.
-Go to the light. Be with sis.

1:56:47.633 --> 1:56:49.384
-Here's the thing. Little idea.
-Wrap it up.

1:56:49.468 --> 1:56:51.637
It's a little out of left field.
Hear me out.

1:56:54.348 --> 1:56:55.349
Thank you.

1:56:57.100 --> 1:56:59.102
Have Margie in Research
set a meeting with Morality

1:56:59.186 --> 1:57:00.938
to go over this business
with the prime minister.

1:57:01.021 --> 1:57:02.981
And I want all new Heartstrings
by end of day.

1:57:03.065 --> 1:57:04.650
-You got it, Captain.
-Let's get after it.

1:57:05.943 --> 1:57:06.777
Hey, yo, Chief,

1:57:06.860 --> 1:57:08.695
I'm gonna hit the food truck.
You want a street taco?

1:57:08.779 --> 1:57:10.989
-Yes, please and thank you, buddy.
-No doubt.

1:57:11.073 --> 1:57:12.449
Excuse me, Clint. What is all this?

1:57:12.533 --> 1:57:14.952
-Which one is this year's perp?
-Well, they all are.

1:57:15.035 --> 1:57:18.121
You're not reading my memos, are ya?
We're expanding, Jake.

1:57:18.205 --> 1:57:20.624
Ghost of Ramadan Past,
Ghost of Hanukkah Yet-to-Come.

1:57:20.707 --> 1:57:24.086
-It's a whole thing. You're gonna love it.
-We don't have the personnel for all this.

1:57:24.169 --> 1:57:26.922
We're meeting later
about the ongoing self-care program.

1:57:27.005 --> 1:57:28.632
I'd love you to stop by.

1:57:29.299 --> 1:57:30.968
-Yes. Okay. All right.
-Good.

1:57:31.051 --> 1:57:33.011
-I'll stop in.
-Okay, I look forward to it.

1:57:33.095 --> 1:57:36.807
-Nice to see you, big sister.
-Hey, Clint. And then--

1:57:36.890 --> 1:57:37.933
Boo.

1:57:38.433 --> 1:57:39.434
What you working on?

1:57:39.518 --> 1:57:41.478
This perp file is driving me nuts.

1:57:41.562 --> 1:57:43.438
I just can't find a Heartstring
we can grab onto.

1:57:43.522 --> 1:57:44.648
Mind if I take a peek?

1:57:44.731 --> 1:57:46.608
-Please.
-Great.

1:57:46.692 --> 1:57:49.444
Just don't use it as an excuse
to come home late tonight.

1:57:49.528 --> 1:57:51.113
Well, that hurts.

1:57:51.196 --> 1:57:52.239
I will be early.

1:57:54.449 --> 1:57:56.660
No, no, no, no, no.
You're a ghost. Let's get going.

1:58:12.092 --> 1:58:14.678
Kim, this place looks amazing.

1:58:14.761 --> 1:58:16.889
Clint, you know I can't see you. Can you…

1:58:17.431 --> 1:58:19.391
I always forget. Sorry.

1:58:20.601 --> 1:58:21.602
Hi.

1:58:23.145 --> 1:58:25.397
-Nice to see ya.
-Nice to see you.

1:58:26.648 --> 1:58:28.692
Well, come on in.
He's out back with the kids.

1:58:28.775 --> 1:58:31.862
-Is it ready yet?
-Yeah, it's not ready yet.

1:58:31.945 --> 1:58:33.780
-Is it done?
-But I can't build it,

1:58:33.864 --> 1:58:36.992
if I keep dropping the damn screws
in the grass!

1:58:37.075 --> 1:58:43.665
Hey, Ronny. Ronny, put that down. Ronny!
Ronald J. Fishman Pratt, put it down!

1:58:44.249 --> 1:58:45.626
-Okay.
-That was bad.

1:58:45.709 --> 1:58:47.794
Sorry, kids.
I didn't mean to shout. All right?

1:58:47.878 --> 1:58:50.339
-Come on, bring it in. Come on.
-Uncle Clint!

1:58:50.422 --> 1:58:51.924
Bring it in.

1:58:52.007 --> 1:58:53.550
That never gets old. Okay. Hey.

1:58:53.634 --> 1:58:55.093
He still comes out from time to time.

1:58:55.177 --> 1:58:56.803
That's okay. Hey, I'm sorry to barge in.

1:58:56.887 --> 1:58:59.097
I'm having a little trouble
with this file.

1:58:59.181 --> 1:59:01.600
-You mind putting your eyes on it?
-No, not at all.

1:59:01.683 --> 1:59:02.768
-Okay. Yeah?
-Yeah.

1:59:02.851 --> 1:59:04.311
-Great. Thanks.
-Yeah. Yeah, sure.

1:59:04.811 --> 1:59:07.189
Ronny! There's a bathroom inside.

1:59:09.858 --> 1:59:12.444
You see that Wrenny
got into the master's program at Stanford?

1:59:12.528 --> 1:59:13.529
Oh, yeah.

1:59:13.612 --> 1:59:16.406
Owen texted me as soon as she got in.
I'm sure proud of that kid.

1:59:18.617 --> 1:59:21.703
Told ya. This perp is a tough nut
to crack, isn't she?

1:59:21.787 --> 1:59:23.747
Yeah. But wait, look. Look right there.

1:59:23.830 --> 1:59:26.959
See that tiny flutter in her exposure?

1:59:27.042 --> 1:59:29.503
-Butterflies.
-Butterflies. She was in love.

1:59:30.087 --> 1:59:32.840
-No! Come on.
-Yeah.

1:59:32.923 --> 1:59:35.926
-We've looked everywhere. When? With who?
-Well, you didn't look there.

1:59:36.009 --> 1:59:38.720
In her early 20s. I don't know.
We have to find out with who.

1:59:39.388 --> 1:59:40.556
With who. With "whom"?

1:59:41.598 --> 1:59:43.141
Right. "With whom."

1:59:43.225 --> 1:59:45.727
-Yeah, I think that sounds educated.
-With whom.

1:59:46.395 --> 1:59:47.271
Yeah, sure.

1:59:48.564 --> 1:59:50.190
-I hear that.
-I do too.

1:59:50.899 --> 1:59:53.861
-It's a reprise?
-That-- It's-- Yeah, the-- a reprise.

1:59:53.944 --> 1:59:55.320
-Is it reprise?
-It's reprise.

1:59:55.404 --> 1:59:56.947
-Or-- It's reprise.
-Yes.

1:59:57.531 --> 2:00:00.284
You wait for the day
You prep for a year

2:00:00.367 --> 2:00:02.953
And when the big day is finally here

2:00:03.036 --> 2:00:06.957
You take a jerk and work
To turn 'em around

2:00:09.293 --> 2:00:12.129
You show 'em their life
And you hope for the switch

2:00:12.212 --> 2:00:14.840
And when it goes off without a hitch

2:00:14.923 --> 2:00:18.719
This Christmas train is party-bound

2:00:18.802 --> 2:00:19.845
A puppy!

2:00:20.345 --> 2:00:23.015
We're giddy with a holiday
Goodwill gleam

2:00:23.098 --> 2:00:25.684
'Cause helping out is sweeter
Than eggnog cream

2:00:26.268 --> 2:00:31.148
We might be dead
But we're living that Yuletide dream

2:00:31.231 --> 2:00:34.234
We're full of that
Christmas morning feeling

2:00:34.318 --> 2:00:37.029
Is there a morning more appealing?

2:00:37.112 --> 2:00:40.449
-The magical mood when being merry
-Is very necessary

2:00:40.532 --> 2:00:42.701
We're changing all mankind

2:00:42.784 --> 2:00:45.913
We planted the seeds
And joy is blooming

2:00:45.996 --> 2:00:48.916
Now we got one less hateful human

2:00:48.999 --> 2:00:51.793
We're doing the world a world of good

2:00:51.877 --> 2:00:54.379
Putting some nice
Into the neighborhood

2:00:54.463 --> 2:01:00.219
Playing our parts
Changing hearts, one by one

2:01:00.302 --> 2:01:04.598
We got that Christmas morning feeling
And damn, is it fun

2:01:04.681 --> 2:01:07.559
Fa-la-la-la-la, fa-la-la-la-la

2:01:07.643 --> 2:01:10.562
Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

2:01:10.646 --> 2:01:14.816
Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

2:01:18.153 --> 2:01:21.156
We're full of that
Christmas morning feeling

2:01:21.240 --> 2:01:23.825
Feels like my soul went snowmobiling

2:01:23.909 --> 2:01:27.412
-Saving a perp from certain peril
-We're like A Christmas Carol

2:01:27.496 --> 2:01:29.957
In perfect harmony

2:01:30.040 --> 2:01:32.835
If we're jacked up on joy
And cheer, it's

2:01:32.918 --> 2:01:35.838
'Cause we're insanely awesome spirits

2:01:35.921 --> 2:01:38.715
Doing the world a world of good

2:01:38.799 --> 2:01:42.219
Cause that's our after-livelihood
Bringing…

2:01:42.302 --> 2:01:45.305
Couple of 'em ghosts was twerking
over there, if you look closely.

2:01:45.389 --> 2:01:47.015
-I saw. Yeah. I noticed.
-You did?

2:01:47.099 --> 2:01:48.976
That's why you wanna clear
your browser history.

2:01:49.059 --> 2:01:54.398
And that Christmas morning feeling
Has only just begun

2:01:54.481 --> 2:01:56.567
Fa-la-la-la-la, fa-la-la-la-la

2:01:56.650 --> 2:02:00.445
-Begun
-Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la…

2:02:09.204 --> 2:02:11.999
Good afternoon!

2:02:21.133 --> 2:02:23.135
Guys, do you wanna hear
the rest of my song?

2:02:23.719 --> 2:02:26.763
Every day I wake up
With a single dream

2:02:26.847 --> 2:02:28.682
Running through my head

2:02:28.765 --> 2:02:31.310
Look, I have another meeting
I'm actually late for.

2:02:31.393 --> 2:02:34.813
To throw a tiny stone
Into a mighty stream

2:02:34.897 --> 2:02:37.691
And watch the ripples as they spread

2:02:39.151 --> 2:02:42.946
Well, we fall in line
Follow every rule

2:02:43.614 --> 2:02:47.409
But is that something
We should really take pride in?

2:02:47.492 --> 2:02:50.579
'Cause we're treading water
In the kiddie pool

2:02:51.580 --> 2:02:57.127
When there are oceans
We could turn the tide in

2:02:57.669 --> 2:03:01.298
If you wanna make a ripple

2:03:01.381 --> 2:03:05.385
If you wanna make a wave

2:03:05.469 --> 2:03:08.889
Playing safe and thinking small
Doesn't move the ball at all

2:03:08.972 --> 2:03:12.851
There's humanity to save

2:03:13.435 --> 2:03:17.356
Can we really make a ripple

2:03:17.439 --> 2:03:21.276
With our feet up while we float
Too afraid to rock the boat

2:03:21.360 --> 2:03:25.113
If we never test the waters
We'll never know

2:03:25.197 --> 2:03:27.199
Just how far the ripples go

2:03:27.991 --> 2:03:30.536
Do you wanna make
A ripple, ripple, ripple?

2:03:31.537 --> 2:03:33.830
I think you wanna make
A ripple, ripple, ripple

2:03:33.914 --> 2:03:36.250
Consider the consequences.

2:03:36.333 --> 2:03:38.126
Consider the possibilities.

2:03:40.212 --> 2:03:43.507
Now, if we choose this dude
One goes to two then four

2:03:43.590 --> 2:03:45.884
And then it jumps from four to eight

2:03:45.968 --> 2:03:47.594
Ripple, ripple, ripple

2:03:47.678 --> 2:03:48.512
Yes!

2:03:48.595 --> 2:03:51.765
Soon, you guys
It multiplies to thousands more

2:03:51.849 --> 2:03:54.643
Can you hear it reverberate?

2:03:54.726 --> 2:03:56.144
Ripple, ripple, ripple

2:03:56.228 --> 2:03:59.398
Then to millions and to billions
And it never ends

2:04:00.148 --> 2:04:04.111
And all across the world
The change is gaining some traction

2:04:04.194 --> 2:04:05.487
Reaching other planets

2:04:05.571 --> 2:04:07.114
Maybe aliens

2:04:07.197 --> 2:04:12.494
From one man we began a chain reaction

2:04:12.578 --> 2:04:14.788
Ripple, do you wanna make a ripple?

2:04:15.289 --> 2:04:18.125
Do you wanna make a ripple?
Ripple, ripple, ripple, ripple

2:04:18.208 --> 2:04:21.420
If we wanna make a ripple

2:04:22.296 --> 2:04:25.632
That could turn into a wave

2:04:26.216 --> 2:04:29.803
Time to be what we're about
Gotta turn this mother out

2:04:29.887 --> 2:04:34.099
-Friends, it's just called being brave
-It's just called being brave

2:04:34.183 --> 2:04:37.060
We need more than just a ripple

2:04:37.978 --> 2:04:41.940
Make the choice to take a chance
Let's put on our big boy pants

2:04:42.024 --> 2:04:45.569
If we only skim the surface
We'll never know

2:04:45.652 --> 2:04:48.071
Just how far the ripples go

2:04:48.697 --> 2:04:50.616
Do you wanna make
A ripple, ripple, ripple?

2:04:50.699 --> 2:04:52.868
Do you wanna make
A ripple, ripple, ripple?

2:04:52.951 --> 2:04:54.870
Do you wanna make
A ripple, ripple, ripple?

2:04:54.953 --> 2:04:57.331
Do you wanna make
A ripple, ripple, ripple?

2:04:57.414 --> 2:05:01.043
-Can we redeem the unredeemable?
-Is he redeemable?

2:05:01.126 --> 2:05:04.922
Can we just risk it all
And find a way?

2:05:05.005 --> 2:05:08.967
-Can we accomplish the impossible?
-Is it impossible?

2:05:09.051 --> 2:05:12.429
Well, it's impossible to say

2:05:12.513 --> 2:05:16.099
But I have to believe
Inside the worst of us

2:05:16.183 --> 2:05:18.685
There is some decency there

2:05:18.769 --> 2:05:20.229
Decency-cy-cy-cy-cy

2:05:20.312 --> 2:05:24.024
I know that we can achieve
Something miraculous

2:05:24.107 --> 2:05:28.237
-If we only dare
-Do we dare, do we dare?

2:05:28.320 --> 2:05:30.989
-Damn right, I dare
-Yes, we dare

2:05:31.073 --> 2:05:34.618
If we wanna make a ripple

2:05:35.160 --> 2:05:38.789
Ripple out to make a wave

2:05:38.872 --> 2:05:42.918
Then let's fry some bigger fish
Ask forgiveness, not "permish"

2:05:43.418 --> 2:05:46.255
There's humanity to save

2:05:46.839 --> 2:05:50.884
Can't resign yourself to ripples

2:05:50.968 --> 2:05:54.680
'Cause you'll barely make a dent
Giving 99 percent

2:05:54.763 --> 2:06:00.102
Go for broke
Because it's time that we finally know

2:06:00.727 --> 2:06:03.605
Just how far the ripples go

2:06:30.924 --> 2:06:32.426
Okay, Mr. Ray Maddison,

2:06:32.509 --> 2:06:35.637
elevators are right down the hall,
and here's the key card to your suite.

2:06:35.721 --> 2:06:37.764
Hang on, don't look left, eyes on me.

2:06:37.848 --> 2:06:39.516
There's a problem
and I will address it immediately.

2:06:39.600 --> 2:06:40.976
Do not look left.

2:06:41.059 --> 2:06:43.562
I'm gonna murder a man in the grand lobby.

2:06:50.611 --> 2:06:51.945
Oh, no.
