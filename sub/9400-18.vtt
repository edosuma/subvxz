00:02.640 --> 00:05.600
I have a problem with the essay
you selected for the school paper.

00:05.660 --> 00:09.670
I understand,but i thought I was in charge of the
school paper and had final say on what went in it.

00:09.740 --> 00:11.990
And i have final say on
whether or not you work here.

00:12.050 --> 00:16.219
If continuing this pgnancy
means I lose you,then we end it.

00:18.020 --> 00:19.850
I'm having this baby.

00:19.960 --> 00:21.660
We're having this baby.

00:21.750 --> 00:23.180
What do you want me to say?

00:23.290 --> 00:26.530
How about,julian"?

00:26.690 --> 00:28.780
How about,"I like you"?

00:28.890 --> 00:32.040
You want to talk about
keith?Let's talk about keith.

00:32.159 --> 00:36.660
From the way I see it,I pulled
the trigger,but you loaded the gun.

00:36.880 --> 00:39.520
It's good that you're
gonna die soon,dan.

00:39.960 --> 00:41.550
Grandpa?

00:41.640 --> 00:43.130
It's time for you to get better.

look,I'm not saying I do or I de  havany

01:51.650 --> 01:54.180
llicit narcotics
currently in my domicile.

01:54.290 --> 02:00.140
But if I did and my dog happened
to eat,say,3 ounces of,actually,

02:00.300 --> 02:03.680
some really nice lebanese
hash,would yosay he'd be okay...

02:03.850 --> 02:05.720
or no?

02:05.830 --> 02:08.900
Sit your stupid ass down,and
I'll call a veterinarian.

02:11.160 --> 02:12.970
Mr. Scott.

02:13.240 --> 02:16.600
- We'll get you prepped in a moment.
- Okay.

02:18.780 --> 02:22.460
Lucas. Is everything all right?

02:23.000 --> 02:26.570
It's fine.I'm getting a heart.

02:26.900 --> 02:29.040
It's about time.

03:03.980 --> 03:05.080
I need a helicopter.

03:05.220 --> 03:06.880
For the final river court
scene -- lucas told me.

03:06.990 --> 03:09.530
But you can shoot it with a
crane.You don't need a helicopter.

03:09.690 --> 03:10.660
Yes,but I've never had
sex in a helicopter before.

03:10.880 --> 03:14.100
Excuse me,julian?Brooke davis on line 1.

03:14.430 --> 03:16.240
Nice.

03:16.350 --> 03:18.860
- I have to call her back.
- Okay.

03:21.030 --> 03:23.060
Is that the girl that
auditioned for peyton?

03:23.170 --> 03:26.290
Yeah.And she was about to be the
girl who auditioned for peyton,slash,

03:26.340 --> 03:30.830
new office P.A.Having sex with me
in a helicopter,until you ruined it.

03:32.470 --> 03:34.010
I wonder if we could do it in a crane.

03:34.070 --> 03:36.260
Julian,you have a call.

03:36.330 --> 03:39.560
It kind of gets a little crazy right
before production.Can you take a message?

03:39.670 --> 03:42.630
Okay,but it's the head of the
studio -- I mean,your father.

03:43.130 --> 03:45.160
He said it was urgent.

03:48.340 --> 03:50.370
Yeah,dad,what's up?

03:53.220 --> 03:54.400
All right,8 seconds left,down by 2.

03:54.570 --> 03:58.360
Here's what I want.I want
you here,here,here,and here.

03:58.410 --> 04:02.750
Set the picks there,pick there,knock down the
shot,and send their sorry butt home in O.T.

04:03.080 --> 04:04.950
You got me?!

04:06.870 --> 04:08.060
All right.

04:08.170 --> 04:11.740
Big game james,I want you to
inbound the ball and take the shot.

04:11.840 --> 04:13.700
- You with me?
- Yeah.

04:13.920 --> 04:15.400
All right.

04:15.520 --> 04:16.890
"No mercy" on 3.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.370
1,2,3.

04:18.480 --> 04:20.899
No mercy!

04:22.000 --> 04:23.910
Ball,ball!Pass it,pass it!

04:24.150 --> 04:26.560
James,look!Look!

04:26.760 --> 04:28.960
Pass the ball!Pass the ball!

04:34.090 --> 04:36.780
Ball! Madison,ball! Ball!

04:46.650 --> 04:50.110
Hey,ref,that was a foul,man!

04:50.340 --> 04:51.670
Dude,there were like a dozen fouls.

04:51.710 --> 04:53.010
Go home.

04:58.000 --> 05:02.030
I asked you here today,haley,because I
thought we should talk things through.

05:02.080 --> 05:04.580
Having a teacher on suspension
is never good for us.

05:04.630 --> 05:07.590
Well,I would be happy to not be
on suspension,but that's up to you.

05:07.640 --> 05:11.590
And I'd be happy to end your suspension,as
long as you agree to print an apology

05:11.640 --> 05:14.650
for your actions in the next
edition of the school paper.

05:15.930 --> 05:18.070
I've prepared it for you.

05:18.430 --> 05:22.610
I'll also be taking over the paper's
publishing responsibilities going forward.

05:22.710 --> 05:25.340
In addition,you'll address
your literature class

05:25.450 --> 05:30.290
and explain that you were wrong and that
you showed a serious error in judgment.

05:31.140 --> 05:32.930
And if I don't?

05:33.380 --> 05:35.220
You'll be fired.

05:42.340 --> 05:46.270
Jack?Jack!

05:51.540 --> 05:53.070
Jack!

05:55.970 --> 05:58.580
Just give it to me.And go,okay?

06:00.260 --> 06:02.150
I won't tell,I promise.

06:02.400 --> 06:04.390
Just go.Go.

06:56.130 --> 06:57.710
Shoplifting,sam?

06:57.860 --> 07:02.760
You have everything you could ever want,and
you are out ealing,like a common thief?

07:02.910 --> 07:04.490
They're not even pressing charges!

07:04.800 --> 07:08.260
Because I cried and begged and
told them you were semi-retarded!

07:08.370 --> 07:10.670
That is not the point.What the hell?

07:10.770 --> 07:14.950
Did you ever consider that maybe
it was a case of mistaken identity

07:15.000 --> 07:19.700
and that maybe I wasn't shoplifting and that
maybe,just maybe,they got the wrong person?

07:19.780 --> 07:23.040
The wrong peonwith the pack
of hot dogs and no receipt?

07:23.090 --> 07:25.590
I don't even like hot
dogs,and I have the money!

07:25.640 --> 07:28.270
The thing is -- the thing is,You
are an unfixable little smartass,

07:28.370 --> 07:30.970
who apparently is gonna
do whatever she wants.

07:31.480 --> 07:32.860
Don'T.

07:32.910 --> 07:34.800
Brooke,it's julian.

07:34.950 --> 07:40.050
I'm sorry --  I've been kind of out
of touch,and I need to talk to you.

07:40.150 --> 07:42.120
Call me.

07:42.180 --> 07:44.730
That got anything to do
with why you're so mad at me?

07:44.830 --> 07:46.160
No.

07:46.260 --> 07:51.820
I am mad at you because it doesn't
feel like you're making any progress.

07:51.870 --> 07:54.570
You stole from me at clothes
over bros,and I figured,

07:54.670 --> 07:59.220
"okay,you were desperate,you
lacked guidance,you felt unloved.

07:59.330 --> 08:00.600
" So,what do I do?

08:00.700 --> 08:04.120
I forgive you,I take
you in,I care for you,

08:04.170 --> 08:07.590
give you anything you want,and
you make me feel like an idiot!

08:07.690 --> 08:10.550
Is that what you really
think -- that I'm unfixable?

08:10.600 --> 08:12.180
Oh,don't put this on me,sam.

08:12.290 --> 08:16.010
I am not the one who got caught stealing
today and then tried to lie my way out of it.

08:16.060 --> 08:17.540
I'm not lying!

08:17.640 --> 08:19.170
And I wasn't stealing,either!

08:19.220 --> 08:22.310
But you know what -- whatever.Believe
whatever the hell you want to believe.

08:25.320 --> 08:26.900
Okay.

08:33.429 --> 08:36.120
Okay,well,maybe you can make
a few cal and get back to me.

08:36.260 --> 08:38.090
Yeah,thanks.

08:39.530 --> 08:41.010
Is everything okay with peyton?

08:41.120 --> 08:43.270
Yeah,so far.Thanks for asking.

08:43.320 --> 08:47.370
Um,what's up?My dad called a
little while ago.He's been fired.

08:47.630 --> 08:50.340
That's too bad.How's he taking it?

08:50.440 --> 08:54.320
Well,he's taking it with a huge cash
settlement and an overall production deal.

08:54.420 --> 08:55.660
Well,so he's good.

08:55.710 --> 08:57.550
I don't think you understand,luke.

08:57.650 --> 08:59.640
Reese: Korman,it's
me.Uh,yeah,I heard.Listen.

08:59.880 --> 09:02.660
I'm pay or play,right?

09:02.920 --> 09:04.960
You're the man. Bye.

09:05.470 --> 09:07.910
Well,boys,it's been a good run.

09:08.020 --> 09:09.390
At least I'm getting paid.

09:09.390 --> 09:11.430
Waitwait,reese,hold on.

09:12.900 --> 09:13.870
What's going on,julian?

09:13.970 --> 09:15.960
What's going on is,the
movie just died,luke.

09:16.070 --> 09:20.200
Our movie just died,and you just
lost your $300,000 production bonus.

09:20.660 --> 09:21.980
Is that true?

09:22.140 --> 09:26.920
When the studio head is terminated,most of the
projects that aren't shooting yet go into turnaround.

09:27.030 --> 09:28.260
Okay.

09:28.410 --> 09:29.860
What's -- what's
turnaround?

09:30.020 --> 09:33.180
- It means they put things on hold.
- Tell the truth,julian.Come on.

09:33.840 --> 09:38.870
Luke... it means your
movie's dead,done,over.

09:38.970 --> 09:40.750
It's like they're all in the third
grade.When the new guy comes in.

09:40.850 --> 09:44.630
He doesn't want to play with the old guy's
toys.He throws them out,buys his own toys.

09:44.730 --> 09:46.520
No,not always.Not always.

09:46.620 --> 09:49.780
This movie got a ton of love from a lot
of executives that are still at the studio,

09:49.890 --> 09:52.080
so just give me a second,hang tight.

09:52.130 --> 09:56.080
Let me make some calls,okay?I'm
nna do everything I can to fix this.

09:56.940 --> 09:58.420
You do that.

09:58.530 --> 10:00.510
This movie is so over.

10:02.650 --> 10:05.100
We're really sorry,coach uncle skills.

10:05.200 --> 10:06.740
It's okay.

10:06.940 --> 10:09.270
It'sy.Ot oka we stink!

10:09.490 --> 10:10.970
We suck.

10:11.070 --> 10:12.480
We're hosed.

10:12.580 --> 10:13.820
Well,wait,hold on,now.

10:13.920 --> 10:15.810
We only lost by two points.

10:16.010 --> 10:17.440
Yeah,but we still lost.

10:17.570 --> 10:20.130
Yeah,but you got to look at
things from the brighter side.

10:20.240 --> 10:26.000
Chuck,you played the whole game today without fouling
and without punching somebody in the crotch,right?

10:26.260 --> 10:27.630
Yeah.

10:27.740 --> 10:31.510
Madison... you didn't start doing your
homework on the bench until the second half,

10:31.610 --> 10:34.620
even when I knew it was killing
you to just relax and have fun.

10:35.230 --> 10:37.020
Right?

10:38.450 --> 10:40.230
All right.

10:41.200 --> 10:43.750
Jamie scott
-- 14 points.

10:43.900 --> 10:46.040
Andre fields
-- 8 points.

10:46.160 --> 10:51.360
And caroline rutenbar -- 2 points,2
rebounds,and no pee in the pants.

10:51.460 --> 10:53.450
Y'all give it up.

10:55.540 --> 11:00.230
All right,don't do drugs,stay in
school,and nanny deb has all the snacks.

11:00.430 --> 11:02.450
Y'all get on out of here,rock stars.

11:07.300 --> 11:09.080
You are so good with them.

11:09.190 --> 11:10.770
Hey,I love kids.

11:10.870 --> 11:12.860
Maybe one day,we'll
have some of our own.

11:15.140 --> 11:17.540
Hey,wait.Save me a juice box.

11:22.590 --> 11:24.520
I am so pissed off!

11:24.570 --> 11:26.360
So,she expects you to apologize.

11:26.420 --> 11:28.420
Yes.Can you believe that?

11:28.560 --> 11:32.890
Well,I bet our kitchen drawers
are really organized right now.

11:33.910 --> 11:35.670
Why do you say that?

11:35.770 --> 11:37.200
Because.

11:37.310 --> 11:39.650
That's who you are,haley james.

11:39.760 --> 11:41.800
And I know that even though
rimkus is completely wrong,

11:41.850 --> 11:43.740
you're thinking about taking
the high road on this one,

11:43.790 --> 11:45.840
because you're a good teacher
and you care about your students.

11:45.950 --> 11:47.270
Yeah,I do care,but
you know what --

11:47.370 --> 11:49.720
when you're young and you look
at how great your life's gonna be,

11:49.770 --> 11:53.990
you don't think about having a rimkus there to screw it all
up with her written apologies and her stupid-ass policies,

11:54.090 --> 11:56.020
and it's totally unfair that I
have to apologize for something,

11:56.070 --> 11:58.960
when I don't even think I was
wrong,because i wasn't wrong.

11:59.060 --> 12:00.910
I get it,baby.And I completely agree.

12:00.960 --> 12:04.020
And if you want to tell rimkus
to shove it,I'm good with that.

12:04.070 --> 12:09.020
But I think you know that if you do that,these
kids are gonna lose the best teacher they have.

12:09.370 --> 12:10.280
Yeah.

12:10.330 --> 12:12.600
So,I'm thinking I'm just
gonna love you even more,

12:12.810 --> 12:17.090
because... you're probably gonna take the
high road and be gracious and honorable,

12:17.140 --> 12:19.850
because that's who you are,haley james.

12:22.190 --> 12:24.890
Our kitchen drawers are
really organized,by the way.

12:28.140 --> 12:30.960
Hi,"Q." Uncle lucas let me come say hi.

12:31.060 --> 12:34.070
We had a game today,and I
scored a bunch of points.

12:34.220 --> 12:36.260
But we lost.

12:36.520 --> 12:38.510
He's doing really good,"Q.

12:38.660 --> 12:40.950
" He's got your crossover dribble.

12:41.160 --> 12:42.840
Andre did great,too.

12:42.960 --> 12:46.190
I know he misses you a lot.We all do.

12:49.690 --> 12:51.470
I'll be right back,okay?

12:54.310 --> 13:00.120
The truth is,I see how worried the
doctors are and how terrified lucas is,

13:00.220 --> 13:03.740
so I'm trying to be strong through
all of it,but I'm scared,mom.

13:04.840 --> 13:10.950
So if you could put in a good
word for us up there... Thanks,mom.

13:12.030 --> 13:15.670
This place is way too full
of people I love and miss.

13:15.820 --> 13:18.170
There's not any room for any more.

13:18.980 --> 13:20.870
You hear me?

13:20.970 --> 13:22.810
Not even one.

13:30.990 --> 13:33.150
Hey,I'll go wait in the car.

13:33.560 --> 13:35.380
Okay.

13:44.750 --> 13:45.740
You ready to go,jame?

13:45.900 --> 13:48.750
How did great-uncle keith die?

13:50.030 --> 13:51.910
He was shot,jamie.

13:52.010 --> 13:54.370
- Like quentin?
- Yeah.

13:56.030 --> 13:59.140
Why do people do bad things
like that,uncle lucas?

14:01.440 --> 14:03.690
Maybe you should ask your grandpa dan.

14:18.050 --> 14:20.240
Is that all you got?!

14:26.250 --> 14:28.340
That's the best you can do?!

14:29.570 --> 14:32.830
A crazy bitch nanny and a dog?!

14:32.980 --> 14:35.480
That supposed to be some
kind of karmic lesson?

14:36.800 --> 14:39.250
Well,I don't need your lesson.

14:39.380 --> 14:44.380
D I'm not gonna apologize,either,or
cower or beg or cry!

14:44.790 --> 14:47.150
I've done that.

14:47.200 --> 14:48.730
It's over.

14:48.830 --> 14:51.080
And let me tell you something else.

14:51.230 --> 14:53.410
I'm not gonna pray,either.

14:53.620 --> 14:55.250
You hear me?!

14:55.300 --> 14:57.460
I won't!I showed remorse.

14:57.570 --> 14:59.710
I said "I'm sorry.

15:01.880 --> 15:07.890
" And if that's not good enough,you come
and get me,god,you miserable son of a bitch.

15:11.460 --> 15:13.910
I give up.

15:30.800 --> 15:33.100
this wasn't great day to be alive.

15:44.190 --> 15:46.340
Julian: It's over.

15:46.560 --> 15:51.010
I talked to everybody I could at
the studio,shutting down production.

15:51.400 --> 15:54.260
It's just politics and bad timing,luke.

15:54.420 --> 15:56.890
So it's definitely not happening.

15:57.010 --> 15:58.930
I'm sorry.

15:59.100 --> 16:01.680
Now I got to go tell a bunch of
people they just lost their jobs.

16:01.790 --> 16:03.800
What about brooke?Did
you talk to her yet?

16:03.900 --> 16:07.530
I tried calling her,but... I'm not
really worried about brooke davis.

16:07.600 --> 16:09.940
Something tells me she'll be just fine.

16:09.990 --> 16:12.080
I didn'tean the job part.

16:12.140 --> 16:14.440
Yeah,I didn't either.

16:14.960 --> 16:18.430
- See you guys around.Bye,jamie.
- Bye.

16:21.670 --> 16:23.360
Well... you were worried about
the book becoming a movie,

16:23.530 --> 16:25.420
anyway -- l the
stuf with keith.

16:25.490 --> 16:27.580
Yeah.

16:28.350 --> 16:30.210
Can I have this picture?

16:30.320 --> 16:32.480
Sure,jame.

16:32.640 --> 16:34.680
What now?

16:35.760 --> 16:38.340
It's peyton.

16:40.260 --> 16:42.240
Okay.

16:42.460 --> 16:43.830
What's wrong?

16:43.890 --> 16:45.240
They don't like the song.

16:45.290 --> 16:47.050
Who?John or the a&r guys?

16:47.220 --> 16:49.630
Apparently all of them.And
it's not like they hate it,okay?

16:49.750 --> 16:51.840
They just don't love
it the same way we do.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.850
- Well,theyg!
- wron I agree.

16:53.910 --> 16:54.760
What do they want to do?

16:54.870 --> 16:58.660
They thought we should try
it on guitar insteaof piano.

16:58.770 --> 17:00.200
But it's perfect on the piano.

17:00.260 --> 17:05.970
Maybe so,honey,but if you love this song and
you want to keep it,maybe you should just try it.

17:07.290 --> 17:09.099
What do you think,haley?

17:10.200 --> 17:12.940
Sometimes you have to play the game.

17:14.980 --> 17:16.569
What game you playing,boy?

17:16.680 --> 17:18.460
"Sims." I'm making my own tree hill.

17:19.810 --> 17:21.290
Is there a skills character?

17:21.400 --> 17:24.930
Yeah.But he mostly just gets
all mushy with nanny deb.

17:25.099 --> 17:26.859
I like your style,baby.

17:26.910 --> 17:29.440
See if you can give uncle
skills  two nanny debs.

17:29.550 --> 17:31.670
- Okay.
- Good man.

17:31.780 --> 17:35.930
But just don't tell the real
nanny deb I said that,okay?

17:45.680 --> 17:47.880
That kid is a genius.

17:49.090 --> 17:51.610
And his nanny's kind of great,too.

17:51.780 --> 17:53.920
You okay?

17:53.970 --> 17:57.120
I've been meaning to talk
to you for some time now.

17:57.340 --> 17:59.700
Okay.

17:59.980 --> 18:03.270
I think we should
end this -- us.

18:03.490 --> 18:05.520
I think we should break up.

18:05.610 --> 18:06.980
Wait.Why?

18:07.090 --> 18:13.620
Because yoshould be a father and have
a family -- one that I can't give you.

18:13.900 --> 18:16.100
Look,baby,you're not that old.

18:16.310 --> 18:18.290
I mean,you could still have kids.

18:18.350 --> 18:20.770
Yes,i could.

18:20.820 --> 18:23.790
But I don't want to.

18:23.960 --> 18:27.010
Okay.I'm good with that.

18:27.120 --> 18:34.360
Oh,you're such a sweet and wonderful
guy,and -- and we have so much fun together.

18:34.700 --> 18:38.870
But at the end of the day,you
deserve more than this.

18:39.200 --> 18:41.780
I don't want more than this.

18:42.150 --> 18:44.890
I think  this is good enough.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.560
For me... but not for you.

18:50.080 --> 18:51.780
I'm sorry.

18:55.740 --> 18:58.150
Brooke,it's julian!

19:06.270 --> 19:07.810
It's julian.

19:07.920 --> 19:10.060
I don't want to talk to him.

19:10.170 --> 19:12.260
Are you guys fighting?

19:12.370 --> 19:14.460
Not exactly.

19:15.280 --> 19:17.040
What not exactly happened?

19:17.100 --> 19:18.580
Nothing.

19:18.640 --> 19:21.660
And I'm still pissed
at you for shoplifting.

19:21.800 --> 19:23.280
You should talk to him.

19:23.400 --> 19:26.810
We're fine.Some time apart
might do us some good,anyway.

19:33.070 --> 19:34.550
Don'T.

19:34.620 --> 19:38.230
Hey,julian.Yeah,she's right here.

19:41.090 --> 19:47.240
When I hang up,I'm going to kill
you,and then your dead body is grounded.

19:48.710 --> 19:50.880
Hi,julian.What's up?

19:52.640 --> 19:55.500
I'm sorry.That's terrible.

19:56.100 --> 19:58.790
So,what does that mean for you?

20:00.910 --> 20:03.380
That's soon.

20:03.660 --> 20:08.220
No,take it.Take it.I'll
-- I'll call you later.Bye.

20:12.660 --> 20:14.920
They pulled the plug on the movie.

20:15.140 --> 20:18.210
He's leaving town
soon -- for good.

20:19.680 --> 20:22.710
Looks like youot that
time apart you wished for.

20:44.070 --> 20:46.110
You're evil.You know that?

20:46.220 --> 20:49.100
Well,what tipped you off?Our
miserable marriage or the prison term?

20:49.210 --> 20:51.130
The insidiousness.

20:51.250 --> 20:54.300
How dare you pin keith's murder on me.

20:56.170 --> 20:59.140
It wasn't your fault.

20:59.190 --> 21:01.570
It wasn't my fault.

21:01.680 --> 21:03.710
I know.

21:05.420 --> 21:08.000
So,I thought you were
getting your heart.

21:10.150 --> 21:12.840
Yeah,it's not gonna work out.

21:13.280 --> 21:16.190
Listen,deb,I was wondering if I
could take jamie for a couple hours.

21:16.300 --> 21:18.950
Why,dan?Why would I do that?

21:20.030 --> 21:22.500
Because he's all I have left.

21:22.610 --> 21:24.330
No.Forget it.

21:24.390 --> 21:26.170
You can come with us,deb.It's
just for a little while.

21:26.230 --> 21:28.260
To do what?

21:31.230 --> 21:33.480
To say goodbye.

21:33.980 --> 21:36.700
- Grandpa dan!
- Hey,there's my guy.

21:37.530 --> 21:39.280
Did you get your heart already?

21:39.390 --> 21:40.970
Can I see it?What's it feel like?

21:41.190 --> 21:43.140
Sorry,buddy.It was a false alarm.

21:43.640 --> 21:45.730
Then where's your pager?

21:48.580 --> 21:50.610
Two hours.

21:51.270 --> 21:53.530
Don't make me regret this.

21:54.080 --> 21:56.990
All right,sweetie,grandpa's
gonna take you for a couple hours,

21:57.040 --> 21:59.220
and then I'lsee you for dinner,okay?

22:03.720 --> 22:05.700
Do you want to come with us,nanny deb?

22:05.750 --> 22:08.830
Oh,um,no,honey.

22:08.990 --> 22:11.580
This is where I say goodbye.

22:14.070 --> 22:16.340
Hey,wait for me right outside.

22:26.430 --> 22:28.740
Goodbye,deb.

22:36.100 --> 22:38.890
Don't feel guilty.

22:45.260 --> 22:47.450
I feel guilty.

22:47.510 --> 22:53.660
Julian was being  so nice to me,and I
freaked out,and I took it out on sam.

22:53.960 --> 22:56.160
I am a horrible person.

22:57.040 --> 22:59.090
"As a teacher,I must adhere to
a higher standard of conduct,

22:59.200 --> 23:00.990
"and I failed to live up
to that higher standard.

23:01.050 --> 23:02.750
For that,I am truly sorry.

23:02.810 --> 23:05.550
" I'm also sorry principal
rimkus is a hairy-backed bitch.

23:06.060 --> 23:08.180
"Guitar.Play it on guitar.

23:08.290 --> 23:10.060
" That's their great idea.

23:10.180 --> 23:14.850
Maybe I can just play it on the
spoons -- a nice spoon ballad.

23:15.230 --> 23:17.920
What the hell's she mean
I'm too good for her?

23:17.970 --> 23:20.260
I'm not too good for
her.Trust me,I know me.

23:20.540 --> 23:23.130
Luke,am I too good for anybody you know?

23:24.010 --> 23:27.800
Dude,I just lost $300,000.Do
you understand that?

23:28.300 --> 23:31.530
$300,000.

23:31.640 --> 23:35.180
And you lost deb?Shut up!

23:36.340 --> 23:37.360
What the hell are you doing here?

23:37.420 --> 23:39.610
Celebrating.

23:41.210 --> 23:44.040
I just got paid for doing nothing.

23:44.370 --> 23:47.000
Everybody,drinks on me!

23:47.050 --> 23:49.690
Who's with me?

23:51.940 --> 23:54.190
Yeah,I'm gonna miss it here.

23:54.250 --> 23:56.880
More than you know.

23:57.160 --> 24:00.710
Hey,I got to run.I'll --
I'll see you in L.A. Okay.

24:02.350 --> 24:04.490
Sorry about the movie.

24:04.770 --> 24:08.170
It's okay.

24:08.280 --> 24:09.990
So,you're just gonna leave now?

24:10.100 --> 24:13.160
- Yeah,but it's okay,sam.
- It's not okay.

24:13.220 --> 24:15.030
What about brooke?

24:15.140 --> 24:16.970
That wasn't gonna work out.

24:17.080 --> 24:18.860
You're an idiot if you believe that.

24:18.970 --> 24:20.930
The only reason she
didn't call you back was

24:20.990 --> 24:24.010
because she was mad at me for
shoplifting,and she didn't --

24:24.060 --> 24:26.390
hold on.Shoplifting?What's
-- what's that all about?

24:27.960 --> 24:29.490
I did it for jack.

24:29.600 --> 24:33.670
He was hungry... and
I just took the fall.

24:33.780 --> 24:36.090
What did brooke say about it?

24:36.200 --> 24:39.000
I didn't tell her.

24:39.820 --> 24:42.580
She called me unfixable.

24:42.640 --> 24:43.840
You know she didn't mean that.

24:43.900 --> 24:45.770
Yeah.I know.

24:45.880 --> 24:49.680
She was just mad at
you.I don't get you guys.

24:49.790 --> 24:53.250
One minute,you're making out on the couch,and
the next minute,you're not even talking!

24:53.310 --> 24:56.050
What happened?

24:56.220 --> 24:58.470
I told her I loved her.

24:58.670 --> 25:01.420
She didn't say it back.

25:02.320 --> 25:06.600
But the movie's over now,so
it doesn't really matter.

25:08.940 --> 25:11.950
No,it does matter.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.910
It's the only thing that matters.

25:31.870 --> 25:37.110
You know,jamie... I'm gonna miss watching
you grow into the man you're gonna be someday.

25:37.930 --> 25:40.690
'Cause I know you're gonna
do great things in your life.

25:41.730 --> 25:44.140
You know I'd be there if I could,right?

25:45.190 --> 25:47.140
Come here,buddy.

25:51.480 --> 25:53.880
- Grandpa?
- Yeah?

25:55.150 --> 25:57.610
You wouldn't lie to me,would you?

25:57.720 --> 25:59.920
Of course not.

26:00.800 --> 26:03.330
Because I need to ask you something.

26:03.380 --> 26:05.800
Anything,buddy.

26:05.910 --> 26:09.590
Who killed great-uncle keith?

26:13.700 --> 26:16.170
I did.

26:16.340 --> 26:19.670
It was me.

26:20.340 --> 26:22.150
I want to go home.

26:33.070 --> 26:33.860
well,look at it
this way,luke --

26:34.090 --> 26:36.450
you lost a movie and a
huge production bonus.

26:36.500 --> 26:41.440
I lost a movie,a huge pa huge
production bonus,and two amazing girls.

26:41.560 --> 26:44.230
Yeah,what happened with brooke,anyway?

26:44.280 --> 26:48.730
Well,we started out just having fun,but then
she told me she needed to be more than that,

26:49.020 --> 26:55.730
so I made it more than that,at which point
she freaked out she just wanted to have fun.

26:56.000 --> 26:59.850
Which made it really not
fun for either of us,sort of.

26:59.960 --> 27:03.640
Hey,you know what -- maybe,uh... maybe
you and brooke will still work it out.

27:03.910 --> 27:05.830
Yeah,we'll see.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.290
"We'll see.

27:07.400 --> 27:08.980
- What?
- It's brooke davis,okay?

27:09.090 --> 27:11.580
So if you don't try,you're an idiot.

27:11.660 --> 27:13.110
Thank you.

27:14.720 --> 27:17.270
Peyton said she came home to find love.

27:17.530 --> 27:23.740
Maybe brooke will leave home to find
it with you and your big-ass forehead.

27:24.560 --> 27:27.520
I like to think of it
as a fivehead,thank you.

27:27.800 --> 27:30.830
And,you know,peyton happened to love
it,among other big things I have.

27:32.200 --> 27:34.070
You know,I'm really glad you're leaving.

27:35.930 --> 27:37.010
Here we go.

27:37.390 --> 27:39.430
Oh,geez.

27:39.700 --> 27:41.900
Boys,boys,boys,boys!

27:44.440 --> 27:47.780
Have I taught you nothing this
entire time that I've known you?

27:47.890 --> 27:55.190
You have a very small window where
excessive,irresponsib consumption is allowed.

27:55.250 --> 28:00.300
For god's sake,drink something expensive,especially
when production is paying for it.

28:03.470 --> 28:05.220
Does anything matter to you,reese?

28:05.330 --> 28:07.480
Now,what is that supposed to mean?

28:07.590 --> 28:10.660
Well,look,I mean,julian and i
really wanted to make this movie.

28:10.720 --> 28:12.610
Lucas has a point,reese.You
don't seem that upset.

28:12.730 --> 28:16.750
I get it,you guys.If we had run even one
measly little frame of film through that camera,

28:16.860 --> 28:19.740
you would be sitting on a
huge,fat production bonus.

28:19.850 --> 28:21.900
It's a lot of money.You're upset.

28:22.120 --> 28:23.200
I respect that.

28:23.260 --> 28:24.850
See,that's just it,man.

28:24.960 --> 28:26.450
It's not about the money.

28:26.560 --> 28:28.590
Well,so what's it about,then?

28:28.820 --> 28:30.420
Wait a minute,wait a
minute,wait a minute.

28:30.590 --> 28:35.470
I'm not a writer,but... let me
-- let me take a shot at this.

28:37.290 --> 28:40.530
It's that we found a
story worth telling.

28:40.580 --> 28:43.000
We got the script just right,we
got the crew just right,

28:43.060 --> 28:45.310
we got the perfect cast,and we were,oh,

28:45.360 --> 28:49.980
so close to being able to make something
that would actually affect somebody --

28:50.090 --> 28:55.080
someone we've never met,but for two hours,we
can have a dialogue with that person,

28:55.140 --> 29:00.410
speak to them and maybe
-- I mean,just Maybe --

29:00.500 --> 29:05.000
illuminate a small part of their
world by telling a story in ours.

29:07.800 --> 29:10.580
Here's the piece of the
puzzle you boys are missing.

29:11.180 --> 29:14.710
Sometimes... the beauty
is in the attempt.

29:16.030 --> 29:17.570
We took a shot.

29:17.620 --> 29:20.730
We gave it everything we
could,and we did it well.

29:20.950 --> 29:23.510
Just didn't work out.

29:23.620 --> 29:26.480
Now,when that happens,you
got two options.

29:26.550 --> 29:28.590
You could sit in a public
park like a couple of homos,

29:28.760 --> 29:32.110
pouting and drinking cheap beer,or...

29:32.730 --> 29:34.850
you could celebrate the attempt!

29:34.950 --> 29:37.640
Raise your glasses
right now,both of you.

29:37.750 --> 29:39.570
Get them up.

29:39.620 --> 29:42.200
To the friendships we've
made along the way...

29:42.260 --> 29:45.500
and the insane amount of ass
we get for doing this job.

29:46.290 --> 29:48.270
You were so close.

29:48.390 --> 29:50.470
So close.

29:50.800 --> 29:54.220
But,above all,don't
let this get you down.

29:54.330 --> 29:56.530
Pick yourself up,find the next one.

29:56.580 --> 29:57.990
It's what we do,boys.

29:59.470 --> 30:01.610
It's what we know.

30:06.560 --> 30:08.100
See?

30:08.210 --> 30:12.550
Look at how happy my baby is that we saved
the movie and she gets to play peyton.

30:13.260 --> 30:16.330
- That's not true.
- But she doesn't know that.

30:20.450 --> 30:22.420
All right,now wait for it.

30:22.590 --> 30:25.010
You two dorks are gonna love this one.

30:34.450 --> 30:35.820
Almost forgot!

30:35.880 --> 30:38.730
I left you guys a little
present in the limo!

30:38.840 --> 30:41.550
Seems I ran a little bit of
film through the camera anyway.

30:41.660 --> 30:45.150
It was a sunset last night
-- gorgeous!Had to have it!

30:45.370 --> 30:47.790
You just got your
production bonuses,boys!

30:47.840 --> 30:49.600
But you can't do that!

30:49.770 --> 30:51.910
I just did!

30:56.240 --> 30:59.430
"And when you speak
of me,speak of me well.

30:59.590 --> 31:01.850
"Bull durham.

31:05.230 --> 31:09.730
"You may not like him,minister...
but you can't deny he's got style.

31:10.990 --> 31:13.020
"Harry potter.

31:13.080 --> 31:15.910
You know he charged that
helicopter to the movie.

31:33.960 --> 31:37.040
I've been asked to speak with all
of you because there is a chance

31:37.090 --> 31:40.060
I may have shown a
small error in judgment

31:40.120 --> 31:43.300
when I published sam's
essay in the school paper.

31:43.350 --> 31:46.980
Which is not to say that sam's essay wasn't
a wonderful piece of writing,because it is.

31:47.090 --> 31:49.080
- It's just
that -- ms.Scott.

31:50.290 --> 31:52.380
This is still my classroom.

31:52.480 --> 31:54.790
For now.

31:58.360 --> 32:00.880
What's the first thing I
taught you about writing?

32:00.990 --> 32:03.470
- Tell the truth.
- Tell the truth.

32:04.290 --> 32:08.850
So I would be a hypocrite if I stood up
here and didn't tell y the truth,right?

32:10.430 --> 32:16.260
Look,the truth is,I love teaching all
of you,and I'm -- I'm proud of you.

32:16.750 --> 32:20.810
But I did what any good teacher would do when
I published sam's essay in the school paper.

32:20.870 --> 32:22.730
It was a powerful piece of writing.

32:22.790 --> 32:27.890
It was honest and naked and real and
everything your writing should be.

32:28.280 --> 32:33.550
And,by the look on principal rimkus'
face,I should probably say goodbye.

32:35.830 --> 32:38.960
Ju try and remember it's too early
for you to start playing the game.

32:39.030 --> 32:41.840
Hell,it's too early for me
to start playing the game.

32:43.100 --> 32:44.360
Stand up for what you believe in.

32:44.470 --> 32:47.860
The truth matters,so
tell it,no matter what.

32:56.230 --> 32:58.530
Brooke.

33:03.150 --> 33:05.010
I was gonna call you,but...

33:05.120 --> 33:09.190
but I said I loved you,and you didn't
say it back,and I said it was fine.

33:09.850 --> 33:11.770
But it wasn'T.

33:12.370 --> 33:14.180
Yeah.

33:14.290 --> 33:18.250
I heard about,um,sam and
the whole shoplifting thing.

33:18.360 --> 33:20.500
But the thing is,it wasn't her fault.

33:20.550 --> 33:26.760
She was just covering for jack,and,you
know,she promised she wouldn't tell.

33:26.900 --> 33:29.150
I called her unfixable.

33:29.650 --> 33:31.400
I know.

33:31.450 --> 33:33.050
But she's not.

33:33.100 --> 33:36.290
And you know she's
not,because she loves you.

33:37.610 --> 33:40.350
And so do I.

33:43.200 --> 33:49.130
And you know what -- that's okay,because
sometimes the beauty is in the attempt.

33:52.150 --> 33:54.400
I got to go.

33:59.140 --> 34:01.010
This is crazy.

34:01.120 --> 34:03.210
I don't want you to go.

34:03.320 --> 34:05.850
And I don't want to go.

34:05.960 --> 34:08.150
But I have to.

34:20.719 --> 34:25.330
Julian,I...

34:28.770 --> 34:31.790
I'm gonna miss you,brooke davis.

34:46.050 --> 34:48.190
Usty.

34:48.350 --> 34:50.330
Yeah.

34:50.719 --> 34:52.860
It's like this.

34:57.740 --> 34:59.610
Hey,I'm sorry about the movie,man.

34:59.720 --> 35:01.810
Haley told you,huh?

35:01.970 --> 35:03.370
She tell you she got fired?

35:03.480 --> 35:05.020
I thought she was just suspended.

35:05.130 --> 35:07.380
That was until this morning.

35:07.650 --> 35:09.990
I don't know,man.I leave
town,and everything goes to hell

35:10.060 --> 35:12.430
haley gets fired,movie falls apart.

35:12.650 --> 35:14.510
Dan's heart.

35:14.590 --> 35:18.200
Yeah,my,uh,mom called me and told
me there was a problem.What's up?

35:18.360 --> 35:20.070
Oh,he didn't tell you?

35:20.120 --> 35:22.320
No.

35:23.250 --> 35:24.900
Dog ate it.

35:24.950 --> 35:26.670
- What?
- I'm serious.

35:26.720 --> 35:29.280
- A dog ate his heart.
- You're kidding me.

35:29.500 --> 35:34.540
I'm standing right there,and this --
this stoner guy's dog trips the paramedic

35:34.660 --> 35:37.840
and... gobbles up his heart.

35:38.340 --> 35:41.450
- You're serious?
- I'm not joking.

35:47.060 --> 35:48.810
Yeah.

35:50.520 --> 35:55.130
So,I guess... this means he's gonna die.

36:38.800 --> 36:41.050
I owe you an apology.

36:44.070 --> 36:45.830
Sam.

36:49.650 --> 36:52.780
You are not unfixable.

36:53.930 --> 36:57.810
Okay?Come here.

37:00.110 --> 37:01.810
I'm sorry,sweetheart.

37:01.920 --> 37:04.120
I'm really sorry.

37:07.850 --> 37:11.750
But I found you something
to show you how sorry I am.

37:24.650 --> 37:26.780
No boys in your bedroom.

37:33.400 --> 37:37.080
Well,close the door,you idiot.You
live in a barn or something?

37:37.290 --> 37:39.440
You're the idiot.

37:45.150 --> 37:46.800
How'd it go?

37:46.860 --> 37:49.660
How would you like a full-time
producer for mia's record?

37:49.770 --> 37:51.240
Oh,god.What happened?

37:51.850 --> 37:54.430
I told the truth!

37:54.810 --> 37:58.390
Well,then,yeah.I mean,we would
love a full-time producer.

37:58.500 --> 38:00.530
Excellent!

38:00.920 --> 38:03.610
So,how does "manhattan" sound on guitar?

38:04.650 --> 38:07.060
It's not bad,actually.

38:07.170 --> 38:08.880
Good.

38:08.930 --> 38:11.240
Now,let's put it back.

38:11.460 --> 38:14.790
Mia,when you started out,did you want
to make great records or not-bad records?

38:14.840 --> 38:16.790
- Great records.
- Great,great records.

38:16.900 --> 38:18.500
Good!So that's what we'll do.

38:18.610 --> 38:23.110
We'll make a great record,and if the label
can't hear it,then...they can argue with peyton.

38:23.500 --> 38:25.480
Oh,I like this team.

38:25.640 --> 38:28.000
I love this team!

38:37.530 --> 38:39.700
So,you're good here?

38:39.810 --> 38:42.610
I'm good.

38:45.460 --> 38:49.300
Okay.Well,I'll...see
you in the morning,then.

38:49.570 --> 38:51.530
Yeah.

39:00.310 --> 39:02.500
I'm glad you're here.

39:02.560 --> 39:04.970
Me too.

39:23.440 --> 39:25.860
You're my sons.

39:25.910 --> 39:28.550
And I failed you.

39:29.790 --> 39:33.800
I'm sorry for that and
for so many other things.

39:34.680 --> 39:39.500
But I'm proud that each of you have become
the kind of man that I could never be.

39:40.170 --> 39:41.970
You're good men.

39:42.090 --> 39:45.220
And yore good brothers.

39:46.040 --> 39:49.440
Don't let the world change that.

40:38.400 --> 40:41.800
james lucas scott,what
are you still doing awake?

40:41.910 --> 40:44.050
I'm making tree hill.

40:45.260 --> 40:47.480
See?That's quentin.

40:47.530 --> 40:49.680
He's still alive here.

40:49.790 --> 40:51.550
That's nice.

40:51.660 --> 40:53.690
And this is our house.

40:53.760 --> 40:56.450
And that's daddy and you and me.

40:57.170 --> 40:59.910
And uncle lucas and
peyton live next door.

41:00.020 --> 41:00.950
Cool.

41:01.110 --> 41:04.080
And this is brooke and sam and julian.

41:06.110 --> 41:07.100
Is that grandpa dan?

41:07.380 --> 41:10.180
Yeah.He has a new heart.

41:12.100 --> 41:13.640
Who's that,sweetie?

41:13.690 --> 41:16.250
That's uncle keith.He's still alive.

41:16.310 --> 41:21.690
He came to make sure grandpa dan was okay,because
him and grandpa dan still love each other.

41:26.630 --> 41:29.570
Okay,jamie,it's time for bed.

41:29.680 --> 41:31.770
Say good night to tree hill.

41:31.990 --> 41:33.520
good night to tree hill.
