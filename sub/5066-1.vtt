03:34.463 --> 03:36.328
How you doing, Keaton?

03:39.769 --> 03:41.669
I can't feel my legs...

03:44.206 --> 03:45.605
Keyser.

03:49.779 --> 03:51.076
Ready?

04:02.725 --> 04:04.090
What time is it?

04:05.461 --> 04:06.621
12:30.

05:12.228 --> 05:15.163
It all started back in New York
six weeks ago.

05:15.297 --> 05:18.892
A truck loaded with stripped gun parts
got jacked outside of Queens.

05:18.968 --> 05:21.402
The driver didn't see anyone,
but someone fucked up.

05:21.470 --> 05:24.098
He heard a voice.
Sometimes that's all you need.

05:27.743 --> 05:32.180
- Mr. McManus?
- Christ! Don't you fucking guys ever sleep?

05:32.681 --> 05:35.479
- We have a warrant for your arrest.
- Fuck you, pig.

05:43.259 --> 05:44.726
Todd Hockney?

05:45.060 --> 05:48.325
- Who wants to know?
- New York Police Department.

05:52.902 --> 05:54.733
- Shit.
- Freeze!

05:54.804 --> 05:56.135
Hold it!

06:01.110 --> 06:02.907
Sure you brought enough guys?

06:38.681 --> 06:39.841
<i>It's quite simple, really.</i>

06:39.915 --> 06:44.784
A restaurant that changes with the taste
without losing the overall aesthetic.

06:44.854 --> 06:46.082
In other words...

06:46.155 --> 06:49.249
the atmosphere will not be painted 
on the walls.

06:51.227 --> 06:54.424
- Let me give you an example-
- This I had to see for myself.

06:57.066 --> 06:58.055
David.

06:59.435 --> 07:02.404
- I'm in a meeting.
- Time for another one.

07:02.571 --> 07:04.937
Everyone, this is David Kujan.

07:05.241 --> 07:08.039
Special Agent Kujan. US Customs.

07:08.377 --> 07:11.904
These gentlemen
are from the New York Police Department.

07:12.047 --> 07:14.948
You look good.
Better than I would have thought.

07:16.819 --> 07:19.913
A small matter of a stolen truck
loaded with guns.

07:22.591 --> 07:23.956
Mr. Keaton?

07:24.760 --> 07:26.591
Will you excuse us for a moment?

07:28.864 --> 07:32.595
We have some questions to ask you downtown. 
You'll be a while.

07:33.168 --> 07:35.636
No. Please, sit down.

07:36.105 --> 07:39.199
This is a small problem.

07:40.142 --> 07:43.339
Enjoy the meal. 
I'll talk to you later.

08:05.467 --> 08:07.731
<i>It didn't make sense that I'd be there.</i>

08:07.803 --> 08:10.533
<i>These guys were hard-core hijackers...</i>

08:10.773 --> 08:12.536
<i>but there I was.</i>

08:15.110 --> 08:17.135
<i>At that point, I wasn't scared.</i>

08:17.212 --> 08:20.147
<i>I knew I hadn't done anything
they could do me for.</i>

08:21.050 --> 08:22.813
<i>Besides, it was fun.</i>

08:23.319 --> 08:25.753
<i>I got to make like I was notorious.</i>

08:26.689 --> 08:28.247
<i>You all know the drill.</i>

08:28.324 --> 08:33.023
<i>When your number is called, step forward
and repeat the phrase you've been given.</i>

08:33.462 --> 08:35.429
<i>Number 1, step forward.</i>

08:39.969 --> 08:43.097
"Hand me the keys you fucking cocksucker."

08:44.840 --> 08:46.808
<i>Number 2, step forward.</i>

08:49.678 --> 08:53.307
Gimme the fuckin' keys,
you fuckin' cocksucker motherfucker!

08:53.382 --> 08:57.045
Knock it off. Get back.
Number 3, step forward.

09:06.028 --> 09:09.589
- "Hand me the keys, you cocksucker. "
<i>- In English, please.</i>

09:09.832 --> 09:12.699
- Excuse me?
<i>- In English.</i>

09:13.469 --> 09:16.438
Hand me the fuckin' keys, you cocksucker.
What the fuck?

09:16.505 --> 09:18.439
<i>Number 4, step forward.</i>

09:18.674 --> 09:21.472
<i>It was bullshit.
The whole rap was a setup.</i>

09:21.677 --> 09:24.737
"Hand me the keys you fucking cocksucker."

09:25.014 --> 09:26.572
<i>It was the cops' fault.</i>

09:26.649 --> 09:29.709
<i>You don't put guys like that
into a room together.</i>

09:29.885 --> 09:31.910
<i>Who knows what can happen?</i>

09:32.121 --> 09:35.454
"Hand me the keys you fucking cocksucker."

09:36.291 --> 09:39.658
<i>This has really got to be embarrassing
for you guys.</i>

09:39.795 --> 09:40.989
<i>They drilled us all night.</i>

09:41.063 --> 09:44.328
<i>Someone was mad about that truck hijacking 
and the cops had nothing.</i>

09:44.400 --> 09:47.665
<i>They were hoping somebody would slip up
and give them something.</i>

09:47.736 --> 09:50.671
<i>They knew we wouldn't fight,
they knew how to lean on us.</i>

09:50.739 --> 09:53.867
<i>They've been doing it forever.
Our rights went out the window.</i>

09:53.942 --> 09:55.842
<i>It was a violation. Disgraceful.</i>

09:55.911 --> 09:58.744
<i>They went after McManus first.
Topnotch entry man.</i>

09:58.847 --> 10:00.246
What truck?

10:00.616 --> 10:03.744
- The truck with the guns, fucko.
- "Fucko"?

10:06.889 --> 10:09.221
<i>He was a good guy. Crazy, though.</i>

10:09.291 --> 10:11.384
Wanna know what your pal Fenster told us?

10:11.460 --> 10:13.189
- Say who?
- McManus.

10:13.262 --> 10:14.991
He told us another story.

10:15.230 --> 10:18.791
Is that the one about
the hooker with the dysentery?

10:18.967 --> 10:22.061
<i>Fenster always worked with McManus.
He was a real tight-ass.</i>

10:22.137 --> 10:25.402
<i>But when it came to the job,
he was right on. A smart man.</i>

10:25.474 --> 10:28.170
- What are you saying?
- I said he'll flip you.

10:28.243 --> 10:31.212
- He'll what?
- Flip you. Flip you for real.

10:31.280 --> 10:33.646
- I'm shaking. Come on.
- Okay.

10:33.716 --> 10:36.742
- Answer my questions.
- Can you hear me in the back?

10:37.820 --> 10:38.844
Hello?

10:39.421 --> 10:41.048
I want my lawyer.

10:41.390 --> 10:43.950
I'm gonna have your fuckin' badge, 
cocksucker.

10:44.359 --> 10:46.850
<i>Todd Hockney: good with explosives.</i>

10:47.329 --> 10:50.924
<i>Without a doubt, the one guy
who didn't give a fuck about anybody.</i>

10:51.066 --> 10:53.557
You guys don't have a fuckin' leg 
to stand on.

10:53.635 --> 10:54.897
You think so, tough guy?

10:54.970 --> 10:57.495
I can put you in Queens
during the hijacking.

10:57.573 --> 10:58.767
Really?

10:59.041 --> 11:00.508
I live in Queens.

11:00.576 --> 11:02.976
Did you put that together yourself, Einstein?

11:03.045 --> 11:05.639
You got a team of monkeys
working full time on this?

11:05.714 --> 11:09.047
You know what happens
if you do another turn in the joint?

11:10.519 --> 11:13.113
I fuck your father in the shower,
and have a snack.

11:13.188 --> 11:16.521
- Are you gonna charge me, dickhead?
- I'll charge you when I'm ready.

11:16.592 --> 11:19.390
- With what?
- You know damn well, dead man.

11:19.461 --> 11:20.485
<i>But Keaton?</i>

11:20.562 --> 11:23.224
<i>Keaton was the real prize for them
for obvious reasons.</i>

11:23.365 --> 11:26.027
It was your mistake, not mine.

11:28.704 --> 11:30.797
Did you ever stop to ask me?

11:32.307 --> 11:36.368
I've been walking around
with the same face, the same name.

11:37.813 --> 11:39.246
I'm a businessman.

11:39.314 --> 11:41.475
What's that? The restaurant business?

11:41.550 --> 11:45.452
No. From now on you're in the
"getting fucked by us" business.

11:45.521 --> 11:47.955
I'm gonna make you famous, cocksucker.

11:48.023 --> 11:49.615
Like I said...

11:49.925 --> 11:52.018
it was your mistake...

11:52.194 --> 11:53.627
not mine.

11:54.096 --> 11:56.428
You charge me with this shit...

11:57.566 --> 11:59.363
and I'll beat it.

12:00.302 --> 12:01.326
Okay?

12:02.371 --> 12:05.135
Let's get back to the truck, asshole.

12:06.608 --> 12:09.668
Really, somebody's got to do something
about this shit.

12:09.745 --> 12:13.146
They put me in holding every five minutes.
So I did a little time.

12:13.215 --> 12:17.675
Does that mean I get railed every time
a truck finds it's way gone?

12:17.753 --> 12:19.015
Fuck 'em.

12:19.454 --> 12:21.354
Fenster, will you relax?

12:21.690 --> 12:25.888
- These guys don't have any probable cause.
- You fuckin' right. No PC.

12:25.961 --> 12:29.419
You're goddamn right.
You do some time, never let you go.

12:29.498 --> 12:31.989
They treat me like a criminal.

12:32.334 --> 12:35.030
- I'll end up a criminal.
- You are a criminal.

12:36.605 --> 12:39.073
Why'd you got to go and do that?

12:39.374 --> 12:42.901
- I'm trying to make a point.
- Why don't you make your point?

12:42.978 --> 12:45.173
You're making me tired all over.

12:45.314 --> 12:46.372
Fuck it then.

12:47.082 --> 12:49.243
- I heard you were dead.
- Yeah?

12:49.585 --> 12:52.554
- You heard right.
- Word I got is you hung up your spurs.

12:53.255 --> 12:56.088
- What's that all about?
- What's this?

12:56.391 --> 13:00.953
Rumor has it Keaton's gone straight.
I hear he's tapping Edie Finneran.

13:01.029 --> 13:02.053
Who's that?

13:02.264 --> 13:04.755
She's a heavyweight 
criminal lawyer from uptown.

13:04.833 --> 13:06.767
I hear she's Keaton's meal ticket.

13:06.969 --> 13:08.766
How 'bout it, Keaton?

13:08.971 --> 13:10.666
You a lawyer's wife?

13:11.406 --> 13:13.374
What kind of retainer you giving her?

13:17.045 --> 13:18.910
Do your friend a favor...

13:19.648 --> 13:21.377
tell him to keep quiet.

13:22.384 --> 13:23.874
Dean Keaton...

13:25.354 --> 13:26.946
Gone clean?

13:27.456 --> 13:29.048
Say it ain't so.

13:29.358 --> 13:32.657
- Or was it you that hit that truck?
- Mac, forget him.

13:32.995 --> 13:35.225
Did you get to talk to your lawyer?

13:35.964 --> 13:37.795
This whole thing was a shakedown.

13:38.100 --> 13:41.592
- What makes you say that?
- How many times you been in a lineup?

13:42.771 --> 13:44.932
It's always you and four dummies.

13:45.007 --> 13:48.272
The PD are paying homeless guys
$10 a head half the time.

13:48.543 --> 13:51.740
There's no way they'd line
five felons in the same row.

13:52.014 --> 13:55.677
- What's a voice lineup?
- Public defender could get you out of that.

13:55.751 --> 13:59.243
- Why the hell was I strip searched?
- It was the feds.

13:59.488 --> 14:01.820
A truckload of guns gets snagged.

14:01.890 --> 14:05.656
Customs comes down on NYPD for answers. 
They come up with us.

14:05.894 --> 14:09.022
- They're clutching at straws.
- I had a guy's finger up my ass.

14:09.197 --> 14:10.459
Is it Friday already?

14:12.601 --> 14:13.795
Yeah, lover boy.

14:13.936 --> 14:17.030
You want a piece? Jump in. 
I'll love you.

14:17.239 --> 14:20.902
So who in the goddamn piss hell
stole our fucking truck?

14:21.810 --> 14:24.870
- What did you say?
- Who stole the fucking truck?

14:24.947 --> 14:28.075
- I don't want to know.
- Who asked you, workingman?

14:28.150 --> 14:30.880
Fuck who did it.
What I want to know is, who's the gimp?

14:30.953 --> 14:33.217
- He's okay.
- Says you. How do I know that?

14:33.288 --> 14:35.381
What about it, pretzel man?
What's your story?

14:35.457 --> 14:36.754
His name is Verbal.

14:37.492 --> 14:38.823
Verbal Kint.

14:38.894 --> 14:40.384
- Verbal?
- Yeah.

14:40.462 --> 14:43.590
Roger, really. 
People say I talk too much.

14:43.832 --> 14:45.732
I was going to tell you to shut up.

14:45.901 --> 14:49.530
- We met before, once or twice.
- In County. I was in for fraud.

14:49.604 --> 14:51.868
You were in a lineup then, too.
What happened?

14:52.040 --> 14:54.873
I walked. 90 days, suspended.

14:55.177 --> 14:57.941
- So you did it.
- All right, now look...

14:59.314 --> 15:02.078
we've all been put out
by this whole thing, right?

15:02.250 --> 15:05.981
I figure we owe it to ourselves
to salvage a little dignity.

15:06.488 --> 15:09.753
Now, me and Fenster
heard about a little job.

15:09.891 --> 15:11.688
Why don't you just calm down?

15:12.160 --> 15:14.094
What do you care what he has to say?

15:15.163 --> 15:17.028
I'm just talking here.

15:17.499 --> 15:20.525
It seems to me like Mr. Hockney
wants to hear it...

15:20.602 --> 15:22.593
and I know Fenster's down.

15:23.438 --> 15:25.201
What about you, guy?

15:26.575 --> 15:27.940
I'm interested.

15:29.211 --> 15:30.405
There. See?

15:30.779 --> 15:33.805
I'd like to exercise my right
to free assembly.

15:34.049 --> 15:35.846
Why don't you just shut up?

15:41.923 --> 15:43.481
You're missing the point.

15:44.159 --> 15:45.217
No.

15:46.328 --> 15:48.296
You're missing the point.

15:48.497 --> 15:50.931
I don't want to hear anything from you.

15:51.500 --> 15:53.491
I don't care about your job.

15:55.337 --> 15:56.463
And...

15:58.640 --> 16:01.165
I want nothing to do with any of you.

16:01.643 --> 16:04.840
I beg your pardon,
but you can all go to hell.

16:07.516 --> 16:08.813
Dean Keaton...

16:09.584 --> 16:11.074
gone the high road.

16:12.621 --> 16:14.714
What is the world coming to?

16:19.728 --> 16:20.990
Fuck him.

16:25.700 --> 16:27.361
<i>And that was how it started:</i>

16:27.436 --> 16:29.836
<i>The five of us brought in
on a trumped-up charge...</i>

16:29.905 --> 16:31.873
<i>to be leaned on by half-wits.</i>

16:35.177 --> 16:37.645
I really can't talk about it much here.

16:37.712 --> 16:41.307
<i>What the cops never figured out,
and what I know now...</i>

16:41.383 --> 16:44.648
<i>was that these men would never break,
never lie down.</i>

16:45.554 --> 16:47.647
<i>Never bend over for anybody.</i>

16:48.657 --> 16:49.885
<i>Anybody.</i>

17:05.840 --> 17:09.038
- Who are you?
- Agent Jack Baer, FBI.

17:09.310 --> 17:11.369
- How many dead?
- 15 so far.

17:11.445 --> 17:14.243
They're still pulling bodies
out of the water.

17:14.382 --> 17:16.349
- Any survivors?
- Two.

17:16.417 --> 17:19.215
One guy's in County hospital,
but he's in a coma.

17:19.287 --> 17:22.381
The DA has a second guy,
a cripple from New York.

17:22.457 --> 17:24.823
The chief wants this place sealed off.

17:24.925 --> 17:27.759
If you have any questions, give him a call.

18:01.863 --> 18:05.162
<i>This is Dave Kujan.
I'll be in Los Angeles until Tuesday.</i>

18:05.267 --> 18:09.465
<i>If you need to reach me, contact Jeff Rabin
of the San Pedro Police Department...</i>

18:09.538 --> 18:12.371
<i>at extension 112. Have a nice day.</i>

18:16.545 --> 18:18.706
<i>- Why can't I see him?
- I told you...</i>

18:18.780 --> 18:21.772
the DA came down here last night 
ready to arraign...

18:21.850 --> 18:23.909
even before they moved him to County.

18:23.985 --> 18:26.351
Kint's lawyer shows up five minutes later...

18:26.421 --> 18:29.948
the DA comes out looking like
the bogeyman smacked him around.

18:30.025 --> 18:33.153
They take his statement,
and they cut him a deal.

18:33.228 --> 18:37.255
- Did they charge him with anything?
- Weapons, misdemeanor 2.

18:37.632 --> 18:39.099
What is that?

18:39.668 --> 18:43.263
I give the DA credit for getting that much,
you understand?

18:43.338 --> 18:44.862
Excuse me, sir.

18:46.074 --> 18:50.033
This whole thing has turned political.
The mayor was here last night.

18:50.111 --> 18:53.444
The chief. 
This morning, the governor called, okay?

18:53.515 --> 18:57.713
I'm telling you, this guy is protected
from up on high by the Prince of Darkness.

18:57.786 --> 19:00.220
- Take my word for it.
- When does he post bail?

19:00.288 --> 19:02.518
- Maybe two hours, tops.
- I want to see him.

19:02.591 --> 19:04.456
- No.
- I gotta see him.

19:04.526 --> 19:07.188
- No. I can't-
- You gotta do this for me.

19:07.262 --> 19:09.492
I came a long way for this.

19:10.165 --> 19:11.632
Dave, please.

19:15.136 --> 19:18.003
Even if I let you talk to him,
he won't talk to you.

19:19.474 --> 19:21.305
He's paranoid about being recorded.

19:21.376 --> 19:23.970
- He knows the rooms are wired.
- I quit.

19:24.045 --> 19:27.014
This won't be an interrogation,
just a friendly chat.

19:27.215 --> 19:30.309
- He won't go into the interrogation room.
- Then someplace else.

19:30.385 --> 19:31.545
Where?

19:33.588 --> 19:34.816
No, no.

19:35.123 --> 19:38.752
If this was a dope deal, where's the dope?
If it was a hit, who called it?

19:38.827 --> 19:42.319
I'm sure you have a host of wild theories
to answer all these questions.

19:42.397 --> 19:45.764
- You know what I think.
- That's crazy, and it doesn't even matter.

19:45.834 --> 19:48.701
The guy's got total immunity.
His story checks out.

19:49.004 --> 19:53.236
- He doesn't know what you want to know.
- I don't think he does, not exactly.

19:53.575 --> 19:56.237
But there's a lot more to his story,
believe me.

19:56.611 --> 20:00.240
I wanna know why 27 men died on that pier...

20:00.315 --> 20:04.615
for what looks to be $91 million
worth of dope that wasn't there.

20:04.853 --> 20:08.289
And above all,
I want to be sure Dean Keaton's dead.

20:08.790 --> 20:10.052
He's dead.

20:10.458 --> 20:13.484
Come on. Two hours.
Just till he makes bail.

20:13.862 --> 20:15.295
They're all dead.

20:15.363 --> 20:17.661
I don't care how tough
you say Keaton was...

20:17.732 --> 20:20.633
nobody on that boat
could've come out alive.

20:23.872 --> 20:26.864
- Is he talking?
- He regained consciousness an hour ago.

20:26.941 --> 20:29.375
He spoke, not English, then he lapsed.

20:29.544 --> 20:31.944
- Hungarian?
- That might have been it.

20:32.013 --> 20:34.914
- Most of them were Hungarians.
- You gotta put this on.

20:34.983 --> 20:37.645
Burn victims are very susceptible to infection.

20:38.186 --> 20:40.654
And, of course, there's no smoking.

20:50.365 --> 20:52.993
Keep your mask up.
Please don't touch him.

20:53.068 --> 20:54.194
Is he gonna die?

20:54.302 --> 20:56.930
He's burned 60 percent of his body,
broken ribs-

20:57.005 --> 20:59.667
Call security. Put a man on the door.

20:59.741 --> 21:01.902
- Is he dangerous?
- Yes.

21:02.210 --> 21:03.302
Do it.

21:03.878 --> 21:05.243
Do it now!

21:08.350 --> 21:10.750
Joel? Baer. Down at LA County.

21:10.919 --> 21:14.878
Look, the guy they pulled out of the harbor
is Arkosh Kovash.

21:15.023 --> 21:16.786
Yes, I'm sure.

21:17.292 --> 21:18.987
No, he's all fucked up.

21:20.829 --> 21:22.456
I can't hear you.

21:23.098 --> 21:25.157
Will you shut up? I'm on the phone.

21:25.767 --> 21:26.791
Yes.

21:27.736 --> 21:29.670
No, not till I put a man on him.

21:29.804 --> 21:32.170
Send me someone who can speak Hungarian.

21:32.307 --> 21:35.037
He's awake.
He's talking like a Thai hooker.

21:35.110 --> 21:36.475
Keyser Soze.

21:37.712 --> 21:40.010
- What?
- Keyser Soze!

21:44.919 --> 21:46.147
No shit?

21:47.622 --> 21:50.420
Call Dan Metzheiser over at Justice...

21:50.759 --> 21:53.023
and find Dave Kujan from Customs.

22:27.061 --> 22:30.360
Verbal, this is Agent Kujan from Customs.

22:31.166 --> 22:32.633
Nice to meet you.

22:32.767 --> 22:35.292
He wants to ask you a few questions
before you go.

22:35.370 --> 22:38.828
- What about?
- About a Dean Keaton, mostly.

22:40.074 --> 22:42.542
I'd like to start at the lineup
back in New York.

22:42.610 --> 22:45.943
- Can I get some coffee?
- In a while. Let's talk about the lineup.

22:46.114 --> 22:49.413
I'm really thirsty.
I used to dehydrate as a kid.

22:49.484 --> 22:51.850
Once I got so bad
my piss come out like snot.

22:51.920 --> 22:54.946
- It was all thick and gooey-
- I'll get your fucking coffee.

22:55.023 --> 22:57.583
Get me one, too, while you're at it.

23:01.996 --> 23:03.691
That guy is tense.

23:03.932 --> 23:05.593
Tension is a killer.

23:05.700 --> 23:08.669
I used to be in a barbershop quartet
in Skokie, Illinois.

23:08.736 --> 23:11.671
The baritone was this guy
named Kip Diskin, big fat guy.

23:11.773 --> 23:14.401
Like, orca fat.
He was so stressed in the morning-

23:14.476 --> 23:18.435
- You know we're trying to help you.
- Sure, and I appreciate that.

23:18.513 --> 23:21.641
And I wanna help you, Agent Kujan.
I like cops.

23:21.716 --> 23:24.310
I would've liked to have been a fed,
but my CP-

23:24.385 --> 23:28.344
You're not tellin' us everything.
I know you know something.

23:28.590 --> 23:30.558
<i>I told the DA everything I know.</i>

23:32.460 --> 23:34.860
<i>I know you like Keaton.</i>

23:35.597 --> 23:39.089
<i>- I know you think he's a good man.
- I know he was good.</i>

23:39.167 --> 23:40.600
<i>He was a corrupt cop.</i>

23:40.668 --> 23:43.398
<i>Sure. 15 years ago,
but he was a good thief.</i>

23:44.239 --> 23:46.104
The cops wouldn't let him go legit.

23:46.174 --> 23:48.301
Dean Keaton was a piece of shit.

23:51.346 --> 23:54.110
Are you trying to get a rise out of me?

23:54.949 --> 23:58.009
- I just wanna hear your story.
- It's all there.

23:58.920 --> 24:00.683
May I have a cigarette?

24:03.892 --> 24:06.793
- According to your statement-
- I need a light.

24:09.898 --> 24:13.129
According to your statement,
you're a short-con operator...

24:13.201 --> 24:14.828
run-of-the-mill-

24:19.173 --> 24:22.700
According to your statement,
you're a short-con operator...

24:23.444 --> 24:25.002
run-of-the-mill scams.

24:25.079 --> 24:27.843
It's been suppressed.
Anything in there is inadmissible.

24:27.916 --> 24:31.215
I know. Sweet deal you have here.
Total immunity.

24:33.488 --> 24:37.891
I do have the weapons charge.
I'm lookin' at six whole months hard time.

24:37.959 --> 24:40.018
You know a dealer named Ruby Deemer?

24:41.462 --> 24:43.589
You know a religious guy named John Paul?

24:43.798 --> 24:46.767
- You know Ruby's in Attica?
- He didn't have my lawyer.

24:46.834 --> 24:48.734
I know Ruby. He's big on respect.

24:48.803 --> 24:51.294
He's a good friend of mine,
likes me very much.

24:51.372 --> 24:54.341
I know your testimony is sealed.
Ruby's well connected.

24:54.409 --> 24:57.105
He's got lots of friends inside
who do favors for him.

24:57.178 --> 25:01.012
What would he say if he found out
you dropped his name to the DA?

25:01.349 --> 25:04.807
- There's nothing there on Ruby.
- I'll be sure to mention that to him.

25:04.886 --> 25:07.946
Know what I've learned on the job?
How to spot a murderer.

25:08.022 --> 25:10.388
Say you arrest three guys
for the same killing.

25:10.458 --> 25:11.925
Put them in jail overnight.

25:11.993 --> 25:14.325
Next morning,
whoever's sleeping is your man.

25:14.395 --> 25:18.024
If you're guilty, you know you're caught.
You let your guard down.

25:18.132 --> 25:20.327
- You follow me?
- No.

25:20.635 --> 25:22.068
Let me get to the point.

25:24.005 --> 25:28.066
I'm smarter than you,
and I'm gonna find out what I wanna know.

25:28.142 --> 25:30.440
I'll get it, whether you like it or not.

25:31.646 --> 25:33.136
I'm not a rat.

25:39.520 --> 25:40.714
Thanks.

25:45.059 --> 25:48.825
When I was pickin' beans in Guatemala
we used to make fresh coffee.

25:48.896 --> 25:51.956
Right off the trees, I mean. 
That was good.

25:52.033 --> 25:55.901
- This is shit, but I'm in a police station.
- Can we get started again?

25:55.970 --> 25:58.200
What happened after the lineup?

26:04.112 --> 26:07.104
The desk sergeant was telling me
he couldn't release you.

26:07.181 --> 26:10.309
Can you believe that?
You weren't even charged.

26:10.385 --> 26:11.784
Damn police.

26:14.455 --> 26:16.946
I wanna have pictures taken of your face.

26:17.025 --> 26:20.119
- I'll take them to the DA tomorrow.
- Forget about it.

26:20.194 --> 26:22.958
I'll have this thing in front
of a grand jury by Monday.

26:23.031 --> 26:24.965
I don't want to talk about it, okay?

26:27.935 --> 26:29.766
What did Fortier and Renault say?

26:30.371 --> 26:32.931
They asked for more time
to think about investing.

26:33.007 --> 26:34.099
Damn it.

26:34.609 --> 26:35.803
More time for what?

26:36.277 --> 26:39.735
No matter how you cover my tracks
they're still gonna find out about me.

26:40.248 --> 26:41.977
Give me some credit.

26:42.216 --> 26:44.548
I got you this far.
Let's go to the grand jury.

26:44.619 --> 26:48.715
- This isn't gonna stop if we don't-
- It's never going to stop, period.

26:49.323 --> 26:53.521
By next week, every investor in the city
is gonna be walking away from us.

26:55.129 --> 26:56.460
It's finished.

26:56.698 --> 26:58.165
I'm finished.

27:03.805 --> 27:06.000
Don't give up on me now.

27:08.042 --> 27:10.010
It's never gonna stop.

27:17.285 --> 27:18.650
I love you.

27:19.721 --> 27:22.019
They ruined me in there tonight.

27:24.025 --> 27:25.390
I love you.

27:26.994 --> 27:28.120
Do you hear me?

27:35.336 --> 27:36.428
What?

27:39.040 --> 27:40.371
All right.

27:41.476 --> 27:43.467
Let's just go to my place.

27:58.793 --> 28:00.784
We'll worry about this tomorrow.

28:04.899 --> 28:06.457
Let's go.

28:08.936 --> 28:11.632
<i>Fenster and McManus
had a cagey proposition:</i>

28:11.706 --> 28:14.300
<i>A fast-jump, high-risk, long money.</i>

28:14.709 --> 28:16.438
<i>We all knew it could be done.</i>

28:16.577 --> 28:19.341
<i>The way I figured,
to do it wrong meant killing.</i>

28:19.413 --> 28:21.608
<i>To do it right took five men.</i>

28:22.116 --> 28:23.981
<i>Five men meant Keaton.</i>

28:25.219 --> 28:27.119
<i>Keaton took convincing.</i>

28:29.624 --> 28:31.854
New York's finest taxi service.

28:32.693 --> 28:33.955
Bullshit.

28:34.762 --> 28:36.024
Bullshit.

28:37.265 --> 28:39.290
They don't operate anymore.

28:39.567 --> 28:43.628
McManus has a friend in the 14th precinct.
They're coming out for one job, Thursday.

28:43.704 --> 28:46.639
They're pickin' up a guy
smuggling emeralds from South America.

28:46.707 --> 28:48.504
McManus already has a fence set up.

28:48.576 --> 28:51.511
- A fence? Who?
- Some guy in California called Redfoot.

28:51.579 --> 28:54.571
- I never heard of him.
- You have to come.

28:54.649 --> 28:59.143
- What's it to you whether I do it or not?
- They don't know me. You do.

28:59.387 --> 29:01.753
They won't take me unless you go.

29:02.123 --> 29:03.852
Look at me. I need this.

29:04.859 --> 29:08.124
You're telling me you don't need this?
Is this your place?

29:08.563 --> 29:12.021
I'm not knocking you. 
You got a good scam going with this lawyer.

29:16.804 --> 29:17.964
Sorry.

29:18.906 --> 29:20.806
It's okay.

29:22.043 --> 29:24.773
You say it's the real thing? 
That's cool.

29:27.381 --> 29:28.575
You okay?

29:28.983 --> 29:30.644
I was out of line.

29:31.452 --> 29:34.319
But they're never gonna stop with us.
You know that.

29:34.388 --> 29:37.118
As clean as you get,
they'll never let you go now.

29:37.191 --> 29:41.218
This way, we hit the cops where it hurts,
and we get well in the meantime.

29:45.132 --> 29:46.793
You sure you're okay?

29:47.401 --> 29:48.800
I'll be all right.

30:03.317 --> 30:04.648
Look, I...

30:05.419 --> 30:07.887
- sometimes get-
- Forget it.

30:11.292 --> 30:13.624
I'll probably shit blood tonight.

30:24.639 --> 30:25.901
So...

30:28.542 --> 30:30.442
how do they wanna do it?

30:31.913 --> 30:34.643
McManus wants to go in shooting.
I say no.

30:36.284 --> 30:38.445
Fenster? Hockney?

30:38.619 --> 30:41.315
They're pretty pissed off.
They'll do anything.

30:41.455 --> 30:43.821
I got a way to do it without killing anyone.

30:43.891 --> 30:47.190
But like I say,
they won't let me in without you.

31:05.313 --> 31:06.678
$3 million?

31:08.649 --> 31:10.014
Maybe more.

31:14.655 --> 31:16.020
No killing.

31:17.725 --> 31:19.590
Not if we do it my way.

31:53.561 --> 31:56.758
<i>New York's finest taxi service
was not your normal taxi service.</i>

31:56.831 --> 32:00.790
<i>It was a ring of corrupt cops in the NYPD
that ran a high-profit racket...</i>

32:00.868 --> 32:03.359
<i>driving smugglers and drug dealers
all over the city.</i>

32:03.437 --> 32:06.099
<i>For $300 a mile,
you got your own blue and white...</i>

32:06.173 --> 32:09.199
<i>and a police escort.
They even had their own business cards.</i>

32:09.276 --> 32:13.474
<i>After a while, somebody started asking questions, 
and the taxi service shut down.</i>

32:13.547 --> 32:17.176
<i>Ever since then, Internal Affairs
has been waiting to catch them in the act.</i>

32:17.251 --> 32:18.809
<i>That's where we came in.</i>

32:19.153 --> 32:22.350
- So, how was the flight?
- Fuckin' great.

32:24.225 --> 32:26.625
Will this get me to Staten Island?

32:27.395 --> 32:30.125
Are you kiddin' me?
This will get you to Cape Cod.

32:30.297 --> 32:33.130
<i>McManus came to us with the job.
Fenster got the vans.</i>

32:33.200 --> 32:34.827
<i>Hockney supplied the hardware.</i>

32:34.902 --> 32:37.564
<i>I came through with
how to do it so no one got killed.</i>

32:37.638 --> 32:41.233
<i>But Keaton?
Keaton put on the finishing touch.</i>

32:41.308 --> 32:44.937
<i>A little "fuck you" 
from the five of us to the NYPD.</i>

32:48.249 --> 32:49.477
Watch this.

32:50.651 --> 32:51.675
Careful.

32:51.952 --> 32:53.613
Come on, asshole!

32:55.022 --> 32:56.353
Holy shit!

32:57.358 --> 33:00.486
- Don't move, you fucker!
- Drop it now, motherfucker!

33:00.561 --> 33:02.620
Drop the fuckin' gun! 
Drop it!

33:02.696 --> 33:04.721
Don't fuckin' touch a fuckin' thing.

33:04.799 --> 33:07.427
- What do you guys want?
- Put your fuckin' thing away.

33:07.535 --> 33:09.526
We're cops! Stupid assholes!

33:09.737 --> 33:12.297
- Watch the glass!
- Don't fuckin' move, motherfucker!

33:12.840 --> 33:15.638
- You want a buckshot shampoo, chubby?
- Shut up!

33:18.179 --> 33:19.612
Fuck.

33:21.949 --> 33:24.645
'Afternoon, my little pork chops.
Give me the shit.

33:24.718 --> 33:26.379
- Don't move!
- Give him the shit!

33:26.454 --> 33:28.445
Give him the fuckin' thing!

33:28.522 --> 33:30.353
Give him the fuckin' shit, man!

33:30.624 --> 33:32.751
Hurry up! Come on!

33:33.194 --> 33:35.094
- Now the money!
- There's no money.

33:35.162 --> 33:38.131
- Give me the money now!
- There's no fuckin' money!

33:38.265 --> 33:39.823
Give him the fuckin' money!

33:40.167 --> 33:42.601
- Do it! Give him the money!
- Give me the money!

33:42.803 --> 33:45.067
- Give him the money!
- Hurry up!

33:45.973 --> 33:48.032
You know who the fuck I am?

33:48.242 --> 33:50.904
You people know who the fuck I am? 
Fuck!

33:51.579 --> 33:53.308
We do now, jerk-off.

33:54.115 --> 33:55.412
Cocksucker.

34:00.254 --> 34:02.222
Wait a minute. What's that?

34:04.692 --> 34:05.716
What the fuck?

34:06.327 --> 34:07.624
Holy shit!

34:10.297 --> 34:11.321
Go!

34:24.311 --> 34:26.302
<i>Keaton made an anonymous phone call.</i>

34:26.380 --> 34:28.940
<i>The press was on the scene
before the police were.</i>

34:29.016 --> 34:31.484
<i>Strausz and Rizzi
were indicted three days later.</i>

34:31.552 --> 34:34.385
<i>Within a few weeks,
50 more cops went down with them.</i>

34:34.722 --> 34:38.385
<i>Everybody got it right in the ass,
from the chief on down.</i>

34:38.458 --> 34:40.085
<i>It was beautiful.</i>

34:48.268 --> 34:49.793
I owe you $2.50.

34:51.371 --> 34:52.737
Dr. Keaton.

34:55.509 --> 34:59.070
- There's more here than I thought.
- When's the fence coming?

34:59.446 --> 35:02.040
Redfoot never comes to see me.
I always go to see him.

35:03.450 --> 35:04.940
In California?

35:06.020 --> 35:08.853
Yes, Verbal, in California. 
Fenster and I-

35:08.923 --> 35:12.984
Wait, hold the fuckin' phone.
You and Fenster? No.

35:13.394 --> 35:17.228
- You fuckin' kiddin' me?
- So then, who's gonna go?

35:18.065 --> 35:19.396
We all go.

35:21.135 --> 35:23.433
What's your fuckin' problem, man?

35:23.671 --> 35:27.107
My problem, is you and Fenster
honeymooning in California...

35:27.174 --> 35:30.268
while the rest of us are sittin' here
holding our dicks.

35:30.477 --> 35:32.001
The job's over.

35:32.513 --> 35:33.741
Cool it.

35:34.481 --> 35:37.041
LA's a good place to lay low for a while.

35:39.787 --> 35:41.186
You wanna dance?

35:48.762 --> 35:49.956
Ladies.

35:57.838 --> 35:59.738
I would like to propose a toast.

36:01.208 --> 36:02.698
There you go.

36:05.279 --> 36:06.769
To Mr. Verbal...

36:08.482 --> 36:10.450
the man with the plan.

36:23.464 --> 36:25.193
<i>We're gonna miss the flight.</i>

36:26.267 --> 36:29.361
Don't do this.
Send her a note. Something.

36:30.170 --> 36:31.967
I said we'll make it.

37:05.806 --> 37:08.001
We're gonna miss the plane.

37:09.243 --> 37:10.904
She'll understand.

37:30.464 --> 37:33.456
That's heartwarming. 
Really.

37:35.069 --> 37:36.400
I'm weepy.

37:37.538 --> 37:39.563
You wanna wait outside?

37:42.643 --> 37:45.942
You guys wanted to know what happened.
I'm telling you.

37:46.013 --> 37:47.503
Come on, Verbal.

37:47.715 --> 37:52.550
Who do you think you're talkin' to?
You expect me to believe that he retired?

37:53.554 --> 37:54.953
For a woman?

37:56.824 --> 37:59.418
Bullshit. 
Keaton was using her.

38:00.060 --> 38:02.153
- He loved her.
- Sure.

38:02.229 --> 38:05.687
<i>I'm supposed to believe that hitting
the taxi service wasn't his idea.</i>

38:05.766 --> 38:09.532
<i>- It was all Fenster and McManus.
- Keaton was a cop for four years.</i>

38:09.603 --> 38:11.503
<i>Who else would know better?</i>

38:11.572 --> 38:14.370
<i>- That job had his name on it.
- Edie had him turned around.</i>

38:14.808 --> 38:16.605
Let me tell you something.

38:16.677 --> 38:18.338
I know Dean Keaton.

38:18.412 --> 38:21.210
I've been investigating him
for the past three years.

38:21.281 --> 38:23.875
The guy I know
was a cold-blooded bastard.

38:24.284 --> 38:28.482
IAD indicted him on three counts of murder 
before he was kicked off the force.

38:28.555 --> 38:30.853
Don't sell me the hooker
with a heart of gold.

38:30.991 --> 38:32.481
You got him all wrong.

38:33.627 --> 38:34.719
Do I?

38:35.329 --> 38:39.629
Dean Keaton was under indictment seven times 
while he was on the force.

38:39.767 --> 38:43.259
In every case,
witnesses either reversed their testimony...

38:43.837 --> 38:46.237
or died before they could testify.

38:46.940 --> 38:51.309
When they finally did nail him for fraud,
he spent five years in Sing Sing.

38:51.512 --> 38:53.480
He killed three prisoners inside.

38:54.014 --> 38:56.209
Of course, I can't prove this...

38:57.484 --> 39:00.112
but I can't prove the best part either.

39:01.455 --> 39:03.184
Dean Keaton was dead.

39:04.324 --> 39:05.450
Did you know that?

39:05.726 --> 39:09.457
He died in a fire two years ago,
during an investigation into the murder...

39:09.530 --> 39:12.624
of a witness who was going
to testify against him.

39:12.800 --> 39:15.792
Two people saw Dean Keaton walk 
into a warehouse he owned...

39:15.869 --> 39:17.632
just before it blew up.

39:18.005 --> 39:21.133
They said he went in to check 
a leaking gas main.

39:21.875 --> 39:24.935
It blew up and took all
of Dean Keaton with it.

39:26.547 --> 39:31.109
Within three months of the explosion,
the two witnesses, they were dead.

39:31.618 --> 39:33.677
One killed himself in his car.

39:33.887 --> 39:36.720
The other fell down an open elevator shaft.

39:40.027 --> 39:41.995
<i>Let's get this show on the road.</i>

39:42.062 --> 39:44.792
This is not what we discussed.
There are too many-

39:44.865 --> 39:47.629
I promise we'll be out
before he blows his porch light.

39:47.701 --> 39:50.135
- I have a noon meeting.
- Five minutes.

39:50.204 --> 39:52.104
Everyone calm down, all right?

39:52.172 --> 39:55.505
I want you to ask this man
about the shootout in the harbor.

40:07.421 --> 40:10.288
- He says they were buying-
- Dope. We know.

40:16.029 --> 40:18.930
He doesn't know what they were buying, 
but not dope.

40:19.633 --> 40:21.362
- People.
- What?

40:29.243 --> 40:31.040
He needs guarantees...

40:31.378 --> 40:35.314
- What is he talking about, guarantees?
- He says his life is in danger.

40:35.682 --> 40:37.445
He saw the Devil.

40:37.885 --> 40:39.477
Looked him in the eye.

40:39.553 --> 40:42.147
- I'm on my way.
- No, wait a minute.

40:42.222 --> 40:44.713
Ask him to tell him what he told me...

40:45.559 --> 40:47.254
about the Devil.

40:47.628 --> 40:49.255
Who's the Devil?

40:54.468 --> 40:55.867
Keyser Soze.

41:00.841 --> 41:02.172
Keyser Soze?

41:02.276 --> 41:05.074
He was in the harbor, killing many men.

41:05.846 --> 41:07.609
He saw Keyser Soze?

41:13.954 --> 41:16.445
- He saw his face.
- All right.

41:16.790 --> 41:19.486
Tell him to tell her what he looks like.

41:19.860 --> 41:21.384
Describe him.

41:27.834 --> 41:30.428
<i>Six weeks ago,
I get an anonymous phone call...</i>

41:30.504 --> 41:34.531
<i>telling me I can find Keaton eating 
at Mondino's, and there he is.</i>

41:35.342 --> 41:38.334
Because he never profited
from his alleged death...

41:38.545 --> 41:42.003
and we convicted someone else
of the murder we tried to pin on him...

41:42.215 --> 41:44.012
we had to let him go.

41:44.618 --> 41:47.883
He was dead just long enough
for the murder rap to blow over.

41:48.021 --> 41:49.682
And then he had lunch.

41:50.123 --> 41:52.057
I don't know about that.

41:52.292 --> 41:55.819
I don't think you do,
but you say you saw Keaton die.

41:56.530 --> 41:59.624
I think you're covering his ass,
and he's still out there.

41:59.700 --> 42:02.032
I think he's behind that circus 
at the harbor.

42:02.102 --> 42:05.629
My bet is he's using you because
you're stupid and think he's your friend.

42:05.706 --> 42:08.004
You tell me he's dead, so be it.

42:08.942 --> 42:11.206
I wanna be sure
before I go back to New York.

42:11.278 --> 42:14.213
He wasn't behind anything.
It was the lawyer.

42:14.748 --> 42:16.147
What lawyer?

42:17.017 --> 42:18.041
What lawyer?

42:18.118 --> 42:20.848
Back when I was in that barbershop quartet-

42:20.921 --> 42:23.355
You don't think I know 
you held out on the DA?

42:23.557 --> 42:25.081
What did you leave out?

42:25.158 --> 42:27.422
I could be on the phone to Ruby 
in 10 minutes.

42:27.494 --> 42:30.156
- The DA gave me immunity.
- Not from me.

42:30.297 --> 42:32.765
You get no immunity from me,
you piece of shit.

42:32.833 --> 42:36.325
Every criminal I have put in prison,
every cop that owes me a favor...

42:36.503 --> 42:39.028
every creep and scumbag
that walks the street...

42:39.106 --> 42:41.802
will know the name of Verbal Kint.
You talk to me...

42:41.875 --> 42:44.366
or that precious immunity
they grant you...

42:44.444 --> 42:48.744
won't be worth the paper the contract
put out on your life is printed on.

42:50.851 --> 42:52.580
There was a lawyer.

42:53.887 --> 42:55.218
Kobayashi.

42:56.289 --> 43:00.658
- Is he the one that killed Keaton?
- No, but I'm sure Keaton is dead.

43:01.728 --> 43:03.059
Convince me.

43:03.797 --> 43:05.992
Tell me every last detail.

43:25.352 --> 43:28.788
<i>We arrived in Los Angeles
and met McManus' fence, Redfoot.</i>

43:29.756 --> 43:33.385
<i>He had a good reputation.
Seemed like a good guy.</i>

43:33.627 --> 43:36.619
<i>- Still, we should have known better.</i>
- How you doing?

43:36.697 --> 43:39.723
- Good. You?
- Not bad. Can't complain.

43:40.667 --> 43:42.567
How's it going, Fenster?

43:43.437 --> 43:45.564
Don't need to open it, right?

43:51.445 --> 43:53.174
You must be Keaton.

43:54.214 --> 43:56.011
Redfoot, Dean Keaton.

43:56.283 --> 44:00.276
- Todd Hockney and Verbal Kint.
- Verbal, the man with the plan.

44:01.121 --> 44:02.645
You interested in more work?

44:03.557 --> 44:06.492
- We're always looking for extra work.
- We're on vacation.

44:08.061 --> 44:09.494
That's too bad.

44:09.863 --> 44:12.058
I got a ton of work and no good people.

44:12.499 --> 44:14.433
- Not like you guys.
- What's the job?

44:14.835 --> 44:17.565
There's this jeweler
out of Texas named Saul.

44:17.637 --> 44:19.730
He rents a suite in some downtown hotel.

44:20.040 --> 44:23.441
He does free appraisals.
Sometimes he buys, sometimes he doesn't.

44:23.777 --> 44:26.302
The word is,
he carries around a lot of cash.

44:27.114 --> 44:31.107
So I figure, I keep the merchandise,
you keep the green.

44:31.585 --> 44:33.917
- Simple.
- What about security?

44:33.987 --> 44:37.320
A couple of bodyguards.
Nothing you couldn't handle.

44:37.524 --> 44:39.355
Give me time to check it out?

44:39.726 --> 44:41.887
I expect nothing less from you, man.

44:43.230 --> 44:45.289
Good to see you. We'll call you.

44:45.365 --> 44:47.765
Enjoy LA. Get yourself laid.

44:53.173 --> 44:57.166
A friend in New York tells me
that you knew Spook Hollis.

44:58.145 --> 45:01.205
The way I hear it,
you did time with ol' Spook.

45:01.348 --> 45:03.145
A good man, wasn't he?

45:03.550 --> 45:05.575
I used to run dope for him.

45:06.219 --> 45:08.312
Too bad he got shivved.

45:10.357 --> 45:11.517
I shivved him.

45:14.094 --> 45:17.621
Better you hear it from me now
than from somebody else later.

45:19.099 --> 45:20.760
I appreciate that.

45:21.768 --> 45:23.633
But just out of curiosity...

45:24.204 --> 45:26.866
was it business or personal?

45:29.309 --> 45:30.799
A bit of both.

45:32.345 --> 45:34.006
Like I said...

45:34.381 --> 45:37.248
you give me a call if you're interested.

45:41.388 --> 45:43.117
Is there a problem?

45:44.825 --> 45:46.019
One job.

45:46.526 --> 45:48.153
That was the deal.

45:53.433 --> 45:54.661
One job?

45:57.704 --> 45:58.932
One job?

46:00.640 --> 46:02.574
That's a good one.

46:04.845 --> 46:08.337
<i>Keaton fought it as best he could,
but a man can't change what he is.</i>

46:08.515 --> 46:11.609
<i>He can convince anyone he's someone else,
but never himself.</i>

46:11.685 --> 46:15.314
<i>It took one day with McManus nagging,
and we went back to work.</i>

46:30.036 --> 46:32.596
I get out of my car,
and the thing is wrecked.

46:32.672 --> 46:36.164
I look in the backseat of the other car,
and this woman's totally naked.

46:36.243 --> 46:39.337
- I'm laughin' so hard I can't breathe.
- Get in the car, Saul.

46:39.546 --> 46:42.208
- Freeze, motherfucker!
- Stay right there!

46:44.150 --> 46:46.084
There's a second one here, somewhere.

46:49.823 --> 46:53.054
Gimme the case. 
Give me the fuckin' case!

46:59.232 --> 47:02.668
Give me the fuckin' case.
I'm tellin' you for the last time.

47:02.903 --> 47:04.666
Give me the fuckin' case!

47:09.142 --> 47:11.667
- Come on!
- Don't move!

47:47.113 --> 47:48.740
Hand over the case.

47:49.883 --> 47:51.908
Hand over the fuckin' case.

48:15.909 --> 48:17.570
Come on, let's go!

48:18.211 --> 48:20.771
- Come on!
- Bad day. Fuck it.

48:21.514 --> 48:23.004
Let's go!

48:47.240 --> 48:48.332
Fuck.

48:51.478 --> 48:55.175
- Looks like a lot of china to me.
- Shit.

49:00.487 --> 49:01.977
Guys, come on.

49:03.289 --> 49:05.780
- What are you doin'?
- I'm gonna kill him.

49:05.859 --> 49:07.986
We did it your way, now we'll do it mine.

49:08.061 --> 49:10.222
- You gonna kill him?
- I'll deal with him.

49:10.296 --> 49:13.163
- You'd better, or I'm gonna.
- Shut up.

49:20.540 --> 49:22.974
What am I supposed to do with that?

49:23.276 --> 49:26.404
Feed it to the gimp. Ease his pain.
I don't know what that is.

49:26.479 --> 49:28.504
- What do you mean?
- I don't know.

49:28.748 --> 49:30.875
I got thrown this job by some lawyer.

49:30.950 --> 49:31.939
Who?

49:32.185 --> 49:34.210
I don't know. Some limey.

49:34.387 --> 49:38.016
He's a middleman for somebody.
He doesn't say, I don't ask.

49:38.091 --> 49:40.389
- You're fuckin' full of shit!
- Fuck you.

49:40.460 --> 49:42.155
- Fuck you.
- Listen to me.

49:42.562 --> 49:44.553
We wanna meet him, okay?

49:44.898 --> 49:46.365
That's funny.

49:47.133 --> 49:50.728
He called me last night.
He says he wants to meet you guys.

49:51.404 --> 49:53.304
Okay, we'll meet him.

49:53.706 --> 49:55.606
- I'll call you.
- Good. Let's go.

49:55.675 --> 49:59.042
I don't like it. Wait a minute.
One more thing, tough guy:

49:59.579 --> 50:02.309
Any more surprises, and I'm gonna kill you.

50:03.716 --> 50:06.742
You're such a tough guy.
But do me a favor, all right?

50:06.820 --> 50:08.981
Get the fuck off my dick.

50:09.422 --> 50:10.821
No!

50:11.925 --> 50:13.756
Put a leash on that puppy.

50:15.862 --> 50:19.127
It's an awful shame
about Saul gettin' whacked.

50:19.799 --> 50:21.960
Cops'll be lookin' for the guys who did it.

50:23.036 --> 50:25.664
Sooner or later,
they're gonna come around askin' me.

50:28.108 --> 50:30.338
You have a sweet night, ladies.

50:34.147 --> 50:35.409
Fuck you.

50:41.788 --> 50:44.689
- So this lawyer-
- Kobayashi.

50:45.425 --> 50:47.757
- Came from Redfoot.
- Right.

50:48.161 --> 50:50.994
And why leave this out
when you talked to the DA?

50:51.097 --> 50:53.065
Dave, someone to see you.

50:58.471 --> 51:00.564
I've been looking all over for you.

51:00.640 --> 51:04.269
You still after that coke that took a walk
out of that bloodbath yesterday?

51:04.344 --> 51:07.142
You can stop looking. 
There was no coke.

51:07.213 --> 51:10.876
I've been in LA County talking to a guy 
they pulled out of a drainpipe...

51:10.950 --> 51:12.713
yesterday after the shootout.

51:12.785 --> 51:14.980
He came to this morning,
he started talking.

51:15.054 --> 51:18.319
He's part of a Hungarian mob.
They dealt with gwats from Argentina.

51:18.391 --> 51:20.951
He says it was definitely not a dope deal.

51:21.027 --> 51:24.326
- But there were-
- We know. But he says no on the dope.

51:24.397 --> 51:27.924
This Hungarian tells me they were
pulling stumps for Turkey the next day.

51:28.001 --> 51:31.596
They had no time for that kind of product,
and no means to move it.

51:31.671 --> 51:33.662
- What's the money for?
- He didn't know.

51:34.007 --> 51:36.999
No one doing the deal knew
except for a few key people.

51:37.076 --> 51:39.374
They were all very hush about it, he says.

51:39.546 --> 51:43.778
- Whatever it was, it was very sensitive.
- I don't get it.

51:43.850 --> 51:46.114
You got the cripple in there from New York?

51:46.186 --> 51:47.778
Did he mention Keyser Soze?

51:48.021 --> 51:49.386
Who?

51:49.923 --> 51:51.823
Just bear with me here.

51:53.259 --> 51:56.023
- Who's Keyser Soze?
- Fuck!

51:57.063 --> 52:00.260
We've been goin' over this
for an hour and a half.

52:00.700 --> 52:04.602
What we need to do is find Redfoot
and get the hell out of here now.

52:04.671 --> 52:06.639
What we need to do is think.

52:06.940 --> 52:08.305
Think back.

52:09.442 --> 52:12.206
Somebody with power...

52:12.745 --> 52:15.908
somebody capable of tracking us
from New York to LA.

52:15.982 --> 52:19.076
- What the hell are we doing here?
- We're waiting.

52:19.652 --> 52:23.520
- Sit down.
- No. I'm hot, and I'm fuckin' bored.

52:23.590 --> 52:25.387
Mr. Hockney, do stay.

52:26.125 --> 52:27.490
Mr. Keaton.

52:27.894 --> 52:30.192
Mr. Fenster I recognize from his mug shots...

52:30.263 --> 52:32.094
as well as Mr. McManus.

52:32.165 --> 52:37.159
I can only assume that you are Mr. Kint,
the gentleman who disposed of Saul Berg.

52:37.237 --> 52:40.934
My employer sends his gratitude,
a most unexpected benefit.

52:42.175 --> 52:43.836
I am Mr. Kobayashi.

52:44.043 --> 52:48.742
I have been asked by my employer
to bring a proposal to you gentlemen.

52:48.815 --> 52:51.909
- What do you want?
- My employer requires your services.

52:54.087 --> 52:57.614
One job, one day's work. 
Very dangerous.

52:57.824 --> 53:01.282
He does not expect all of you to live.
But those of you who do...

53:01.494 --> 53:05.487
will have $91 million to divide between you 
in any way you see fit.

53:05.565 --> 53:07.157
Who's your boss?

53:09.402 --> 53:11.029
I work for Keyser Soze.

53:22.382 --> 53:23.610
Who's Keyser Soze?

53:23.683 --> 53:26.083
Judging by the sudden change in mood...

53:26.219 --> 53:29.188
I feel sure the rest of your associates 
can tell you.

53:29.389 --> 53:32.256
I come with an offer
directly from Mr. Soze.

53:32.558 --> 53:36.255
- An order, actually.
- What do you mean, "an order"?

53:36.462 --> 53:41.422
In 1981, you participated in the hijacking
of a truck in Buffalo, New York.

53:42.035 --> 53:45.664
The cargo was raw steel,
steel which belonged to Mr. Soze...

53:45.738 --> 53:49.834
and which was destined for Pakistan
to be used in a nuclear reactor.

53:50.109 --> 53:53.203
A most profitable violation of UN Regulations.

53:53.279 --> 53:55.338
You had no way of knowing this...

53:55.415 --> 53:58.578
because the fellow shipping the steel
was working for Soze...

53:58.651 --> 54:00.209
without his knowledge.

54:00.553 --> 54:03.249
Earlier this year,
Mr. Fenster and Mr. McManus...

54:03.323 --> 54:07.089
hijacked a two-prop cargo flight
out of Newark airport.

54:07.160 --> 54:11.426
The plane was carrying gold and platinum wiring 
also set for Pakistan.

54:12.031 --> 54:15.523
Two months ago,
Mr. Hockney stole a truck...

54:15.601 --> 54:18.126
carrying gun parts through Queens.

54:18.204 --> 54:21.833
Gun parts which were set to be destroyed
by the state of New York.

54:22.041 --> 54:25.875
They were to be lost in a way station
and rerouted to Belfast.

54:25.945 --> 54:28.914
Again, Mr. Soze using pawns
who had no knowledge.

54:29.282 --> 54:31.443
Which brings us to Mr. Kint.

54:32.618 --> 54:35.178
Nine months ago, one of Mr. Soze's...

54:35.254 --> 54:39.816
less than intelligent couriers was taken
in a complicated confidence scam...

54:40.560 --> 54:41.993
by a cripple.

54:42.362 --> 54:44.660
He was relieved of $62,000.

54:45.498 --> 54:48.331
Now, it has taken us some time to find you.

54:48.801 --> 54:52.635
Our intention was to approach you
after your apprehension in New York.

54:52.839 --> 54:54.204
You set up the lineup.

54:54.273 --> 54:57.504
Yes. You were not to be released
until I had come to see you.

54:57.577 --> 55:00.410
It seems Mr. Keaton's attorney,
Miss Finneran...

55:00.780 --> 55:04.307
was a little too effective
in expediting his release.

55:04.384 --> 55:06.579
Holding the rest of you
became a moot point.

55:06.886 --> 55:09.582
- What about Redfoot?
- Mr. Redfoot knew nothing.

55:09.756 --> 55:12.384
Mr. Soze rarely works
with the same people for long...

55:12.458 --> 55:15.222
and they never know
who they're working for.

55:15.361 --> 55:18.262
One cannot be betrayed
if one has no people.

55:19.265 --> 55:21.290
So, why are you telling us?

55:21.701 --> 55:25.865
Because you have stolen from Mr. Soze,
Mr. Fenster.

55:26.105 --> 55:27.163
All of you.

55:27.240 --> 55:30.903
That you did not know it
is the only reason you're still alive.

55:31.511 --> 55:35.174
He feels you owe him.
You will repay your debt.

55:35.615 --> 55:39.449
Fuck the debt, and fuck you.
How do we know you work for Soze?

55:39.919 --> 55:42.479
I don't think that is very relevant.

55:42.655 --> 55:45.818
All five of you are responsible
for the murder of Saul Berg...

55:45.892 --> 55:47.257
and his bodyguards.

55:47.527 --> 55:50.087
Mr. Redfoot can testify to your involvement.

55:50.163 --> 55:52.097
We can see to it that he will.

55:52.165 --> 55:55.225
- What's your point?
- The offer is this, gentlemen:

55:55.535 --> 55:57.696
Mr. Soze's primary interest...

55:58.070 --> 55:59.469
is narcotics.

55:59.705 --> 56:02.333
He has been competing, shall we say...

56:02.408 --> 56:04.876
with a group of Argentineans
for several years.

56:05.077 --> 56:07.910
Competing with Mr. Soze has taken its toll.

56:08.714 --> 56:11.308
These Argentineans are negotiating the sale...

56:11.384 --> 56:15.252
of $91 million in cocaine
in three days time.

56:15.555 --> 56:18.422
Needless to say,
this purchase will revitalize...

56:18.491 --> 56:21.255
the diminishing strength of their organization.

56:22.061 --> 56:25.326
Mr. Soze would like you to stop the deal.

56:26.532 --> 56:29.262
If you choose,
you may wait until after the buy.

56:29.335 --> 56:31.929
Whatever money changes hands is yours.

56:32.805 --> 56:37.606
Mr. Soze would like you to get to the boat
and destroy the cocaine onboard.

56:38.311 --> 56:42.270
And then you will be free
of your obligations to Mr. Soze.

56:44.584 --> 56:48.213
Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't kill you right now.

56:50.189 --> 56:52.783
A gift from Mr. Soze.

56:55.995 --> 56:57.758
Good day, gentlemen.

58:06.599 --> 58:10.194
They got my whole life in here,
everything I've done since I was 18.

58:10.469 --> 58:12.528
They fuckin' know everything.

58:12.705 --> 58:15.469
Everybody I've ever worked with
or did time with.

58:29.956 --> 58:30.980
No.

58:33.225 --> 58:35.489
- This isn't right.
- I don't know.

58:35.561 --> 58:38.655
Who's that guy who used
to talk about Soze in New York?

58:40.333 --> 58:44.497
- Bricks Marlin.
- He did jobs for him, indirect stuff.

58:45.071 --> 58:48.837
He said he always made five times 
more money on it than the job was worth.

58:49.475 --> 58:51.170
This guy's a pipe dream.

58:51.243 --> 58:53.404
Kobayashi's using him for window dressing.

58:53.946 --> 58:55.573
I don't know. 
This is bad.

58:56.082 --> 58:59.813
It's bullshit. This guy could be LAPD.
It's a fuckin' setup.

59:00.820 --> 59:03.687
The way I hear it,
Soze's some kind of butcher.

59:04.056 --> 59:08.288
- A peerless, psycho, fucked-up butcher.
- There is no Keyser Soze!

59:11.097 --> 59:12.655
Who is Keyser Soze?

59:13.833 --> 59:17.701
He's supposed to be Turkish.
Some say his father was German.

59:17.770 --> 59:19.795
Nobody ever believed he was real.

59:20.072 --> 59:23.200
Nobody knew him or saw anybody
that ever worked directly for him.

59:23.309 --> 59:26.335
To hear Kobayashi tell it,
anybody could have worked for Soze.

59:26.445 --> 59:29.505
You never knew. 
That was his power.

59:30.316 --> 59:33.217
The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled...

59:33.753 --> 59:36.654
was convincing the world he didn't exist.

59:38.090 --> 59:40.786
One story the guys told me,
the story I believe...

59:40.860 --> 59:42.555
was from his days in Turkey.

59:42.628 --> 59:45.563
There was a gang of Hungarians
that wanted their own mob.

59:45.631 --> 59:49.032
They realized that to be in power,
you didn't need guns...

59:49.101 --> 59:50.659
or money or even numbers.

59:50.736 --> 59:54.194
You just needed the will to do 
what the other guy wouldn't.

59:54.573 --> 59:57.974
After a while they come into power,
and then they come after Soze.

59:58.044 --> 01:00:01.343
He was small-time then.
Just running dope, they say.

01:00:03.616 --> 01:00:05.015
They come to his home...

01:00:05.418 --> 01:00:08.012
<i>in the afternoon looking for his business.</i>

01:00:08.087 --> 01:00:12.353
<i>They find his wife and kids in the house,
and decide to wait for Soze.</i>

01:00:28.140 --> 01:00:32.406
<i>He comes home to find his wife raped
and children screaming.</i>

01:00:32.478 --> 01:00:35.879
<i>The Hungarians knew Soze was tough,
not to be trifled with.</i>

01:00:35.948 --> 01:00:37.677
They let him know they meant business.

01:00:38.784 --> 01:00:40.308
<i>No!</i>

01:00:43.155 --> 01:00:46.647
<i>They tell him they want his territory,
all his business.</i>

01:00:47.026 --> 01:00:50.587
Soze looks over the faces of his family.

01:00:52.465 --> 01:00:55.923
Then he showed these men of will 
what will really was.

01:01:15.454 --> 01:01:18.423
<i>He tells them he would
rather see his family dead...</i>

01:01:18.824 --> 01:01:21.156
<i>than live another day after this.</i>

01:01:22.628 --> 01:01:24.755
<i>He lets the last Hungarian go...</i>

01:01:24.997 --> 01:01:28.933
waits until his family is in the ground,
and goes after the rest of the mob.

01:01:29.368 --> 01:01:31.996
He kills their kids, he kills their wives...

01:01:32.104 --> 01:01:34.334
he kills their parents and their friends.

01:01:34.874 --> 01:01:37.104
<i>He burns down the houses they live in...</i>

01:01:38.210 --> 01:01:39.973
<i>and the stores they work in.</i>

01:01:40.479 --> 01:01:44.006
<i>He kills people that owe them money.
And like that...</i>

01:01:45.351 --> 01:01:47.148
he's gone, underground.

01:01:47.219 --> 01:01:49.813
Nobody's ever seen him since.
He becomes a myth.

01:01:49.889 --> 01:01:53.052
A spook story that criminals
tell their kids at night.

01:01:53.125 --> 01:01:56.219
"Rat on your pop,
and Keyser Soze will get you."

01:01:57.163 --> 01:01:59.154
No one ever really believes.

01:01:59.398 --> 01:02:01.423
Do you believe in him?

01:02:03.969 --> 01:02:05.698
Keaton always said:

01:02:05.905 --> 01:02:09.341
"I don't believe in God,
but I'm afraid of him."

01:02:11.310 --> 01:02:13.210
I believe in God.

01:02:13.579 --> 01:02:17.606
And the only thing that scares me
is Keyser Soze.

01:02:24.490 --> 01:02:26.515
You give any weight to this?

01:02:26.592 --> 01:02:29.060
I can introduce you 
to Dan Metzheiser from Justice.

01:02:29.128 --> 01:02:32.791
He's got a file on Soze in DC.
It's been a hobby of his for a while.

01:02:32.898 --> 01:02:36.299
A lot of guys equate him to that reporter
on <i>The Incredible Hulk.</i>

01:02:41.307 --> 01:02:42.740
You've heard of him?

01:02:42.808 --> 01:02:44.673
Where? On the street?

01:02:44.743 --> 01:02:47.473
A few times. 
You know, outside stuff.

01:02:47.746 --> 01:02:51.773
Someone working for a guy who worked for a guy 
who got money from Soze.

01:02:51.851 --> 01:02:53.443
Shit like that.

01:02:54.220 --> 01:02:56.518
It could be an old badge. 
A hex sign.

01:02:56.589 --> 01:02:59.683
Keep people from fucking with you
when a name meant something.

01:02:59.758 --> 01:03:01.692
- But you're here.
- Shit, yeah.

01:03:01.927 --> 01:03:06.523
This guy's trying to walk out of a hospital
because he's so afraid of Soze.

01:03:06.866 --> 01:03:08.925
I'll run it up the flagpole.

01:03:10.369 --> 01:03:12.894
I came clean. 
I told it like it happened.

01:03:12.972 --> 01:03:14.496
So what about how I got there?

01:03:14.573 --> 01:03:17.736
It's so full of holes, 
the DA would've told me to forget amnesty.

01:03:17.810 --> 01:03:20.040
You got what you wanted out of me.
Big deal.

01:03:20.112 --> 01:03:22.945
- That's why you never told the DA?
- You tell me.

01:03:23.115 --> 01:03:26.380
If I told you the Loch Ness monster hired me, 
what would you say?

01:03:26.452 --> 01:03:28.716
Turn state's evidence.
We'll put you on the stand.

01:03:28.787 --> 01:03:31.278
I've got immunity.
What can you possibly offer me?

01:03:31.390 --> 01:03:34.985
If there really is a Keyser Soze,
he's gonna come lookin' for you.

01:03:35.461 --> 01:03:36.792
Where's your head?

01:03:37.296 --> 01:03:39.127
Where do you think the pressure is?

01:03:39.198 --> 01:03:42.395
Keyser Soze, or whatever you call him,
knows where I am right now.

01:03:42.601 --> 01:03:46.628
He has the burner on your ass to let me go
so he can scoop me up 10 minutes later.

01:03:46.939 --> 01:03:48.964
Immunity was just a deal with you assholes.

01:03:49.041 --> 01:03:50.941
I got a new problem when I post bail.

01:03:51.010 --> 01:03:53.501
Why play into his hands?
We can protect you.

01:03:54.546 --> 01:03:57.845
Thanks, Dave. Bang-up job so far.
Extortion, coercion.

01:03:57.917 --> 01:04:00.044
Pardon me if I ask you to kiss my pucker.

01:04:00.119 --> 01:04:03.486
The same fuckers that rounded us up
are now bailing me out?

01:04:03.555 --> 01:04:05.216
Fuck you.

01:04:07.126 --> 01:04:09.594
You think you can catch Keyser Soze?

01:04:09.662 --> 01:04:12.722
You think a guy like that
comes this close to getting caught...

01:04:12.798 --> 01:04:14.322
and sticks his head out?

01:04:14.466 --> 01:04:17.230
If he comes up for anything,
it'll be to get rid of me.

01:04:17.569 --> 01:04:19.161
After that...

01:04:19.538 --> 01:04:22.564
my guess is you'll never hear
from him again.

01:04:44.530 --> 01:04:46.225
What happened next?

01:04:46.498 --> 01:04:49.160
We woke up the next morning
and Fenster was gone.

01:04:49.234 --> 01:04:51.759
He couldn't handle the idea
of slumming for Soze.

01:04:52.004 --> 01:04:53.938
He left us a note wishing us good luck...

01:04:54.006 --> 01:04:56.770
and took a chunk of the money
we'd scraped together.

01:04:56.875 --> 01:04:58.001
Then what?

01:04:58.243 --> 01:04:59.676
McManus was furious.

01:04:59.745 --> 01:05:03.977
He talked about tracking him down
and ripping his heart out. All sorts of shit.

01:05:04.750 --> 01:05:06.843
That night, we got the call.

01:05:07.252 --> 01:05:08.480
What call?

01:05:08.654 --> 01:05:11.088
Kobayashi told us 
where we could find Fenster.

01:05:19.231 --> 01:05:21.529
Let's get the fuck out of here.

01:05:23.135 --> 01:05:24.659
We gotta bury him.

01:05:24.870 --> 01:05:26.201
With what?

01:05:26.638 --> 01:05:28.162
With our hands.

01:05:38.017 --> 01:05:39.416
This is nuts.

01:05:39.685 --> 01:05:41.676
It's dry fucking sand.

01:05:41.754 --> 01:05:45.212
When he rots the surfers
are gonna smell him a mile away.

01:05:45.324 --> 01:05:47.383
- Dig, you fuck.
- What are we gonna do?

01:05:47.459 --> 01:05:49.359
This fuckin' guy is gonna kill us.

01:05:49.428 --> 01:05:53.262
I don't know about you, peg leg, 
but I can run. I got no problem with that.

01:05:54.166 --> 01:05:57.329
Kobayashi doesn't seem
to have a problem with it either.

01:05:58.303 --> 01:06:01.067
You run, and we're gonna be diggin' 
a hole for you.

01:06:01.140 --> 01:06:02.607
You got that?

01:06:03.242 --> 01:06:06.609
This ain't my boy we're burying.
I don't owe anybody!

01:06:07.513 --> 01:06:11.176
- So fuck you.
- He was my partner for five years.

01:06:11.417 --> 01:06:14.853
We did more jobs and I saw more money
than you can ever count.

01:06:14.920 --> 01:06:16.319
So fuck you!

01:06:16.955 --> 01:06:20.015
- 'Cause now it's payback!
- It's not payback!

01:06:22.995 --> 01:06:24.394
It's precaution.

01:06:24.797 --> 01:06:27.766
You want payback? You wanna run?
I don't care.

01:06:30.736 --> 01:06:32.966
I'm not doin' this for Fenster.

01:06:33.705 --> 01:06:35.696
I'm not doin' it for you.

01:06:37.176 --> 01:06:39.041
I'm doin' this for me.

01:06:40.846 --> 01:06:42.746
I'm gonna finish this thing.

01:06:43.449 --> 01:06:46.646
This Kobayashi bastard
is not gonna stand on me.

01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:10.001
After they killed Fenster,
nobody would run?

01:07:10.075 --> 01:07:14.011
- I wanted to. I thought we could make it.
- Why didn't you say anything?

01:07:14.079 --> 01:07:16.707
Believe me, I tried,
but Keaton wouldn't have it.

01:07:16.782 --> 01:07:18.807
It was too far-fetched for him.

01:07:18.884 --> 01:07:21.182
Keaton was a grounded guy. 
An ex-cop.

01:07:21.253 --> 01:07:24.188
To a cop, the explanation
is never that complicated.

01:07:24.256 --> 01:07:25.848
It's always simple.

01:07:25.958 --> 01:07:28.518
There's no mystery to the street,
no arch-criminal.

01:07:28.594 --> 01:07:32.360
You got a body and think his brother did it, 
you're probably right.

01:07:32.431 --> 01:07:33.921
Nobody argued with Keaton.

01:07:33.999 --> 01:07:36.695
They just set their minds
to whacking Kobayashi.

01:07:46.612 --> 01:07:47.943
They're coming up.

01:07:49.715 --> 01:07:53.845
<i>- Did you hear me? He's coming up.</i>
- He's on his way down.

01:08:50.542 --> 01:08:51.907
Don't move.

01:08:52.611 --> 01:08:54.340
Press 20. Do it now.

01:09:14.666 --> 01:09:15.758
Move.

01:09:19.171 --> 01:09:22.037
- The answer is "no."
- Mr. Soze will be most-

01:09:22.107 --> 01:09:24.371
Listen, cocksucker,
there is no Keyser Soze.

01:09:24.443 --> 01:09:26.911
Mention his name again,
I'll kill you right now.

01:09:26.979 --> 01:09:30.846
A strange threat. I assume 
you've come here to kill me anyway.

01:09:36.354 --> 01:09:38.755
We know that you can get to us...

01:09:39.625 --> 01:09:42.492
but now you know
that we can get to you.

01:09:43.028 --> 01:09:46.054
I'm giving you one last chance 
to call this off.

01:09:47.532 --> 01:09:49.523
My employer has made up his mind.

01:09:49.701 --> 01:09:52.761
- He does not change it.
- Neither do we.

01:09:52.904 --> 01:09:55.771
You got Fenster,
but you won't be able to get all of us.

01:09:55.841 --> 01:09:58.139
Not before one of us gets through to you.

01:09:58.243 --> 01:10:01.337
I believe you. 
I most sincerely do.

01:10:02.214 --> 01:10:04.944
You would not have been chosen
were you not so suitable.

01:10:05.017 --> 01:10:08.976
But I cannot make this decision.
Whatever you threaten me with is...

01:10:09.054 --> 01:10:11.887
ludicrous in comparison
to what will be done to me...

01:10:11.957 --> 01:10:14.585
if I do not carry out my orders in full.

01:10:22.034 --> 01:10:24.525
I'm the guy that's gonna get you.

01:10:26.204 --> 01:10:28.434
I just wanted you to know that.

01:10:29.374 --> 01:10:31.365
I'm so sorry.

01:10:31.877 --> 01:10:34.368
I implore you, believe me...

01:10:34.780 --> 01:10:36.771
Mr. Soze is very real...

01:10:37.149 --> 01:10:39.640
- and very determined.
- We'll see.

01:10:47.092 --> 01:10:50.459
Before you do me in...

01:10:50.962 --> 01:10:54.898
you will let me finish my business
with Miss Finneran first, won't you?

01:10:59.871 --> 01:11:01.361
What did you say?

01:11:02.441 --> 01:11:04.033
Edie Finneran.

01:11:04.309 --> 01:11:06.334
She's upstairs in my office...

01:11:06.912 --> 01:11:09.107
for an extradition deposition.

01:11:10.148 --> 01:11:12.981
I requested she be put 
on the case personally.

01:11:13.051 --> 01:11:14.848
She flew in yesterday.

01:11:16.855 --> 01:11:18.186
No matter.

01:11:18.657 --> 01:11:20.522
Kill away.

01:11:25.364 --> 01:11:26.831
You're lying.

01:11:27.399 --> 01:11:28.491
Am I?

01:11:45.917 --> 01:11:49.546
Miss Finneran's escort
while she's here in Los Angeles.

01:11:49.621 --> 01:11:51.282
Never leaves her for a moment.

01:11:51.656 --> 01:11:54.181
I thought you'd be glad to know
she's in good hands.

01:11:58.964 --> 01:12:01.762
Get some rest.
The boat will be ready for you on Friday.

01:12:01.900 --> 01:12:04.460
If I see you or any of your friends 
before then...

01:12:04.536 --> 01:12:09.371
Miss Finneran will be the victim 
of a most gruesome violation before she dies.

01:12:09.508 --> 01:12:11.942
As indeed will your father, Mr. Hockney...

01:12:12.544 --> 01:12:15.377
and your Uncle Randall in Arizona,
Mr. Kint.

01:12:16.348 --> 01:12:19.715
I might only castrate
Mr. McManus' nephew, David.

01:12:22.721 --> 01:12:24.621
Do I make myself clear?

01:12:25.090 --> 01:12:27.558
We will take care
of the two bodies downstairs.

01:12:27.626 --> 01:12:29.856
We'll add them to the cost of Mr. Fenster.

01:12:30.729 --> 01:12:32.959
If you'll excuse me, gentlemen.

01:13:11.169 --> 01:13:13.262
It's a logistical nightmare.

01:13:13.405 --> 01:13:16.169
Close quarters. 
10, maybe 20 men.

01:13:16.808 --> 01:13:19.743
There's no tellin'
how many more are gonna be below deck.

01:13:19.811 --> 01:13:22.075
Can we stealth these guys?

01:13:22.447 --> 01:13:25.644
With all that coke, they're gonna be ready.

01:13:26.485 --> 01:13:28.817
Which brings me to sunny point Number 2.

01:13:29.488 --> 01:13:33.015
Even if one of us gets through 
and jacks the boat, we still got nothin'.

01:13:33.091 --> 01:13:34.820
What if we wait for the money?

01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:37.157
Ten more men at least.

01:13:37.929 --> 01:13:40.796
In my opinion, it can't be done.

01:13:41.132 --> 01:13:43.396
Anyone who goes in
is not comin' out alive.

01:13:43.468 --> 01:13:46.437
- I'm gonna wait for the money.
- Me, too.

01:13:46.505 --> 01:13:49.997
- Did you hear what he just said?
- If I'm goin' in, I want a cut.

01:13:50.075 --> 01:13:51.303
Me, too.

01:13:52.811 --> 01:13:54.711
There's nothing that can't be done.

01:13:57.849 --> 01:14:01.546
I just can't believe
we're gonna walk in to certain death.

01:14:07.759 --> 01:14:10.387
The news said it's raining in New York.

01:14:32.017 --> 01:14:33.644
What language is that?

01:14:33.852 --> 01:14:37.015
I don't know. Russian, I think.

01:14:38.957 --> 01:14:40.288
Hungarian?

01:15:44.489 --> 01:15:46.923
The package has arrived, gentlemen.

01:16:06.911 --> 01:16:08.037
You kids ready?

01:16:08.947 --> 01:16:11.609
I would be if I didn't have to stop
and answer you.

01:16:11.783 --> 01:16:13.080
I'm ready.

01:16:13.284 --> 01:16:16.185
McManus, you better be set up in 10 seconds.

01:16:18.156 --> 01:16:19.248
I'm ready.

01:16:20.959 --> 01:16:22.358
I want you to stay here.

01:16:23.728 --> 01:16:25.093
I'm supposed to cover-

01:16:25.163 --> 01:16:27.961
If we don't get out of this,
take the money and go.

01:16:28.033 --> 01:16:29.125
I can't-

01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:31.566
Find Edie.
Tell her everything that happened.

01:16:31.636 --> 01:16:33.695
She knows people. 
She knows what to do.

01:16:33.772 --> 01:16:36.798
If I don't get Kobayashi my way,
she'll get him her way.

01:16:36.875 --> 01:16:39.366
- What if I-
- Just do what I say.

01:16:40.011 --> 01:16:41.205
Please.

01:16:44.549 --> 01:16:46.141
Tell her that...

01:16:49.754 --> 01:16:51.381
Tell her I tried.

01:17:04.569 --> 01:17:07.060
<i>McManus, he's on his way.</i>

01:17:07.439 --> 01:17:08.770
I'm there.

01:18:00.859 --> 01:18:04.625
One, two, three, four...

01:18:05.263 --> 01:18:07.891
five, six, seven...

01:18:09.367 --> 01:18:10.994
Oswald was a fag.

01:18:19.410 --> 01:18:20.434
Hi.

01:18:21.179 --> 01:18:22.669
How you doin'?

01:18:25.517 --> 01:18:27.849
Is there a problem?

01:18:53.411 --> 01:18:54.400
Now.

01:19:24.642 --> 01:19:27.839
<i>"Old McDonald had a farm</i>

01:19:27.912 --> 01:19:30.472
<i>"Ee-aye, ee-aye, O</i>

01:19:31.049 --> 01:19:35.349
"And on that farm, he shot some guys"

01:20:09.053 --> 01:20:10.577
Elvis has left the building.

01:21:21.826 --> 01:21:24.488
<i>No dispares. No dispares. 
Vamonos!</i>

01:21:38.142 --> 01:21:39.336
Hello.

01:22:33.731 --> 01:22:35.096
<i>Why didn't you run?</i>

01:22:35.933 --> 01:22:37.298
I froze up.

01:22:38.036 --> 01:22:41.403
I thought about Fenster
and how he looked when we buried him.

01:22:41.472 --> 01:22:45.568
Then I thought about Keaton,
and it looked like he might pull it off.

01:22:51.716 --> 01:22:53.911
A boy found a body on the beach today.

01:22:53.985 --> 01:22:56.419
Thrown clear of the boat.
Shot twice in the head.

01:22:56.487 --> 01:22:58.421
Two guys from the Bureau identified him.

01:22:58.489 --> 01:23:00.650
- What else?
- His name was Arturo Marquez.

01:23:00.725 --> 01:23:02.659
A petty smuggler from Argentina.

01:23:02.727 --> 01:23:05.594
He was arrested last year in New York 
for trafficking.

01:23:05.663 --> 01:23:09.429
He escapes to California.
They pick him up in Long Beach.

01:23:09.500 --> 01:23:12.901
They're setting up extradition,
he escapes again.

01:23:12.970 --> 01:23:14.267
Now, get this.

01:23:14.338 --> 01:23:17.967
Edie Finneran's brought in
to advise on the proceedings.

01:23:18.042 --> 01:23:19.304
Kobayashi.

01:23:19.377 --> 01:23:21.572
New York faxed me a copy of his testimony.

01:23:21.646 --> 01:23:24.206
- He was a rat.
- A big fucking rat.

01:23:24.282 --> 01:23:27.046
Arturo was very opposed
to returning to prison.

01:23:27.118 --> 01:23:31.020
So much so,
that he named close to 50 people.

01:23:31.255 --> 01:23:33.587
Guess who he named in the finale.

01:23:34.592 --> 01:23:35.991
Keyser Soze.

01:23:36.327 --> 01:23:37.624
There's more.

01:23:50.007 --> 01:23:54.307
I'll tell you what I know.
Stop me when this sounds familiar.

01:23:55.680 --> 01:23:57.910
There was no dope on that boat.

01:24:39.790 --> 01:24:41.121
You, stay quiet.

01:24:41.359 --> 01:24:42.690
He's here.

01:24:43.294 --> 01:24:47.060
I know he's here. That's him.
I'm telling you, that's him.

01:24:47.265 --> 01:24:48.892
I know he's here!

01:24:50.501 --> 01:24:53.561
- You can't understand. That's him.
- Shut up.

01:24:53.638 --> 01:24:58.007
That's him. You hear me?
I'm telling you, it's Keyser Soze!

01:26:56.294 --> 01:26:58.262
- Where's Hockney?
- I don't know.

01:26:58.329 --> 01:26:59.921
There's no coke.

01:27:00.164 --> 01:27:02.064
- What?
- You heard me, dumb fuck.

01:27:02.133 --> 01:27:04.431
- There's no coke!
- What the fuck? No coke?

01:27:04.502 --> 01:27:07.130
I've been up and down
in every fucking room.

01:27:07.204 --> 01:27:09.502
- There's gotta be coke!
- There is nothing!

01:27:09.573 --> 01:27:10.801
Nothing!

01:27:11.309 --> 01:27:12.708
Don't you fuck with me.

01:27:12.910 --> 01:27:16.744
There is no fucking coke!

01:27:27.858 --> 01:27:29.450
I'm out of here.

01:28:10.368 --> 01:28:12.131
I told them nothing.

01:28:13.304 --> 01:28:14.464
I swear.

01:28:15.206 --> 01:28:17.800
I told them nothing. 
Please.

01:29:04.121 --> 01:29:06.988
What the fuck is goin' on?

01:29:09.727 --> 01:29:11.490
The strangest thing.

01:30:06.116 --> 01:30:09.381
That's what you said.
You saw a man in a suit with a slim build.

01:30:09.453 --> 01:30:10.977
Wait a minute.

01:30:11.055 --> 01:30:13.080
Are you saying you saw Keyser Soze?

01:30:13.157 --> 01:30:16.649
- You said you didn't know who it was.
- I know there was dope on that boat.

01:30:16.727 --> 01:30:18.251
- Stop stallin'.
- I'm not.

01:30:18.329 --> 01:30:20.991
- You know what I'm getting at.
- Get out of my face.

01:30:21.065 --> 01:30:23.898
I got immunity. 
I don't have to take this.

01:30:23.968 --> 01:30:25.629
You know what I'm getting at.

01:30:25.703 --> 01:30:28.228
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- The truth!

01:30:28.305 --> 01:30:30.500
Try to tell me you saw someone kill Keaton.

01:30:30.574 --> 01:30:31.598
I did.

01:30:31.675 --> 01:30:33.040
You're lying to me.

01:30:33.110 --> 01:30:36.568
- You've known this whole time.
- I don't know what you're saying.

01:30:36.647 --> 01:30:39.275
I did see Keaton get shot. 
I swear to you.

01:30:39.383 --> 01:30:41.943
Why didn't you help him? 
You had a gun.

01:30:42.086 --> 01:30:43.917
He was your friend.

01:30:47.825 --> 01:30:49.622
Because I was afraid.

01:30:51.862 --> 01:30:54.422
- Afraid.
- Afraid of what?

01:30:55.599 --> 01:30:57.726
- Afraid of-
- I knew it was Keyser Soze.

01:30:58.068 --> 01:31:01.970
It was Keyser Soze, I mean,
the Devil himself.

01:31:03.274 --> 01:31:05.902
How do you shoot the Devil in the back?

01:31:10.381 --> 01:31:12.008
What if you miss?

01:31:17.121 --> 01:31:19.612
Let's get back to the pier.

01:32:42.473 --> 01:32:45.874
- Arturo Marquez. Ever hear of him?
- What? No.

01:32:46.010 --> 01:32:48.638
<i>He was a stool pigeon
for the Justice Department.</i>

01:32:48.712 --> 01:32:51.078
He swore out a statement
to federal marshals...

01:32:51.148 --> 01:32:54.515
saying that he had seen
and could positively identify one...

01:32:54.618 --> 01:32:55.880
<i>Keyser Soze.</i>

01:32:56.353 --> 01:32:58.116
It says right here in the report.

01:32:58.188 --> 01:33:00.986
He had intimate knowledge
of his businesses, including...

01:33:01.058 --> 01:33:04.221
but not exclusive to,
drug trafficking and murder.

01:33:04.294 --> 01:33:05.818
I never heard of him.

01:33:05.896 --> 01:33:08.729
His own people were selling him
to a gang of Hungarians.

01:33:08.799 --> 01:33:12.462
<i>Most likely the same Hungarians
that Soze all but wiped out back in Turkey.</i>

01:33:12.803 --> 01:33:14.464
The money wasn't there for dope.

01:33:14.538 --> 01:33:16.836
The Hungarians were going
to buy the one guy...

01:33:16.907 --> 01:33:19.068
<i>that could incriminate Keyser Soze.</i>

01:33:19.476 --> 01:33:21.944
- I said I never heard of him.
- But Keaton did.

01:33:22.012 --> 01:33:25.072
<i>Edie Finneran was Marquez's
extradition advisor.</i>

01:33:25.149 --> 01:33:27.344
<i>She knew who he was and what he knew.</i>

01:33:27.618 --> 01:33:30.815
There were no drugs on that boat.
It was a hit.

01:33:31.088 --> 01:33:33.556
A suicide mission 
to whack out the one guy...

01:33:33.657 --> 01:33:35.716
<i>that could finger Keyser Soze.</i>

01:33:36.093 --> 01:33:37.958
<i>So Soze put some thieves to it...</i>

01:33:38.362 --> 01:33:40.728
<i>men he knew he could march
into certain death.</i>

01:33:41.065 --> 01:33:43.590
You're saying Soze sent us to kill someone?

01:33:44.835 --> 01:33:47.861
<i>I'm saying Keaton did.
He left you behind for a reason.</i>

01:33:47.938 --> 01:33:49.496
Just do what I tell you.

01:33:49.573 --> 01:33:52.736
If you all knew that Soze
could find you anywhere...

01:33:52.810 --> 01:33:54.801
why did he give you the money to run?

01:33:54.878 --> 01:33:58.177
- He could have used you on the boat.
- He wanted me to live.

01:33:59.817 --> 01:34:02.445
<i>A one-time dirty cop 
without a loyalty in the world...</i>

01:34:02.519 --> 01:34:05.852
<i>finds it in his heart
to save a worthless rat cripple?</i>

01:34:05.923 --> 01:34:07.390
No, sir. Why?

01:34:08.125 --> 01:34:09.149
Edie.

01:34:09.226 --> 01:34:11.854
<i>I don't buy that reform story for a minute.</i>

01:34:11.929 --> 01:34:13.260
Even if I did...

01:34:13.330 --> 01:34:16.925
I certainly don't believe
he would send you to protect her.

01:34:17.267 --> 01:34:18.461
So why?

01:34:20.904 --> 01:34:22.735
Because he was my friend.

01:34:22.806 --> 01:34:26.742
No, he wasn't your friend.
Keaton didn't have friends.

01:34:26.810 --> 01:34:28.277
What are you doing here?

01:34:28.345 --> 01:34:31.075
He saved you because he wanted it that way.

01:34:31.148 --> 01:34:32.274
It was his will.

01:34:32.883 --> 01:34:35.511
- Keaton was Keyser Soze.
- No.

01:34:35.586 --> 01:34:39.147
<i>A man who could wrangle the wills of men 
like Hockney and McManus.</i>

01:34:39.223 --> 01:34:41.748
<i>A man who could engineer a police lineup...</i>

01:34:41.825 --> 01:34:44.589
<i>through all his years of contacts in NYPD.</i>

01:34:44.661 --> 01:34:47.186
The kind of man
who could've killed Edie Finneran.

01:34:52.202 --> 01:34:55.035
She was found yesterday
at a hotel in Pennsylvania...

01:34:55.105 --> 01:34:56.970
shot twice in the head.

01:35:01.879 --> 01:35:04.712
What do you think about Keaton now?

01:35:06.016 --> 01:35:07.005
Edie?

01:35:07.084 --> 01:35:09.314
He used all of you to get him on that boat.

01:35:09.386 --> 01:35:12.787
<i>He couldn't get on alone.
He had to pull the trigger himself...</i>

01:35:12.856 --> 01:35:14.756
to make sure he got his man...

01:35:14.858 --> 01:35:16.917
the one man that could identify him.

01:35:18.028 --> 01:35:19.655
This is all bullshit.

01:35:19.897 --> 01:35:21.865
You said you saw him die.

01:35:24.268 --> 01:35:25.292
<i>Or did you?</i>

01:35:25.469 --> 01:35:27.835
You had to hide
when you heard the police cars.

01:35:27.905 --> 01:35:30.305
<i>You said you heard the shot
before the fire...</i>

01:35:30.774 --> 01:35:32.799
but you didn't see him die.

01:35:33.076 --> 01:35:35.874
- I knew him. He would never-
- He programmed you.

01:35:35.946 --> 01:35:38.574
<i>He programmed you to tell us
what he wanted you to.</i>

01:35:38.649 --> 01:35:40.879
<i>He knew we were close.
You said it yourself.</i>

01:35:40.951 --> 01:35:43.977
<i>Where was the political pressure
to protect you from?</i>

01:35:44.254 --> 01:35:45.278
It was Keaton.

01:35:45.355 --> 01:35:48.688
- Immunity was your reward.
- But why me?

01:35:49.259 --> 01:35:51.352
Why not Fenster or McManus or Hockney?

01:35:51.428 --> 01:35:54.124
Why me? I'm stupid.
I'm a cripple. Why me?

01:35:54.198 --> 01:35:55.631
Because you're a cripple.

01:35:56.166 --> 01:35:57.861
Because you're stupid.

01:35:58.135 --> 01:36:00.069
Because you're weaker than them.

01:36:04.374 --> 01:36:05.671
If he's dead...

01:36:06.109 --> 01:36:10.011
If what you say is true,
then it won't matter.

01:36:11.548 --> 01:36:14.415
It was his idea to hit the taxi service,
wasn't it?

01:36:14.518 --> 01:36:17.681
- Come on, tell me the truth.
- It was all Keaton.

01:36:18.989 --> 01:36:21.514
We followed him from the beginning.

01:36:23.293 --> 01:36:24.453
I didn't know.

01:36:24.962 --> 01:36:26.691
I saw him die.

01:36:27.531 --> 01:36:30.523
I believe he's dead. 
Christ.

01:36:31.768 --> 01:36:33.565
You're not safe on your own.

01:36:37.674 --> 01:36:38.902
You think he's...

01:36:39.209 --> 01:36:40.801
Keyser Soze?

01:36:41.578 --> 01:36:43.205
I don't know.

01:36:44.715 --> 01:36:48.674
Keyser Soze's a shield,
or like you said, a spook story.

01:36:49.753 --> 01:36:53.382
But I know Keaton, and someone
is out there pulling strings for you.

01:36:54.157 --> 01:36:57.593
- Stay here and let us protect you.
- I'm not bait. I post today.

01:36:57.861 --> 01:36:59.294
You posted 20 minutes ago.

01:36:59.863 --> 01:37:01.922
Capt. Leo wants you out of here.

01:37:02.199 --> 01:37:05.168
- Unless you turn state's.
- I'll take my chances.

01:37:05.502 --> 01:37:09.199
If someone wants to get you,
they're gonna get you out there.

01:37:09.273 --> 01:37:12.674
Turn state's evidence.
You might never see trial.

01:37:12.743 --> 01:37:13.937
Maybe so.

01:37:15.512 --> 01:37:17.412
But I'm not a rat.

01:37:34.197 --> 01:37:35.755
Fuckin' cops.

01:38:00.223 --> 01:38:02.817
Can I use your fax machine?

01:38:06.797 --> 01:38:09.493
You'll have to sign for these, Mr. Kint.

01:38:11.635 --> 01:38:13.227
One watch, gold.

01:38:13.737 --> 01:38:15.830
One cigarette lighter, gold.

01:38:16.707 --> 01:38:18.698
One pack of cigarettes. 
Thank you.

01:38:19.309 --> 01:38:21.334
We still got nothing.

01:38:21.645 --> 01:38:23.909
I know what I wanted to know about Keaton.

01:38:23.981 --> 01:38:25.608
Which is nothing.

01:38:26.116 --> 01:38:29.677
No matter.
He'll have to know how close we came.

01:38:30.187 --> 01:38:32.781
<i>Keyser Soze or no Keyser Soze...</i>

01:38:33.156 --> 01:38:36.091
<i>if Keaton is alive,
he's not comin' up again.</i>

01:38:36.526 --> 01:38:38.323
<i>I'll find him.</i>

01:38:38.795 --> 01:38:40.285
<i>Waste of time.</i>

01:38:43.100 --> 01:38:45.432
<i>A rumor's not a rumor that doesn't die.</i>

01:38:45.902 --> 01:38:47.028
<i>What?</i>

01:38:48.138 --> 01:38:49.105
<i>Nothing.</i>

01:38:51.141 --> 01:38:52.972
Man, you're a slob.

01:38:53.043 --> 01:38:55.375
But it all has a system.

01:38:56.246 --> 01:39:00.683
It all makes sense if you look at it right.
You gotta stand back from it.

01:39:01.985 --> 01:39:05.079
You wanna see a real horror show?
See my garage.

01:39:42.426 --> 01:39:44.485
<i>Convince me. Tell me every last...</i>

01:39:44.561 --> 01:39:47.553
<i>When I was in that barbershop quartet
in Skokie, Illinois...</i>

01:39:47.631 --> 01:39:51.192
<i>- Where's your head?
- We need to think, think back.</i>

01:39:51.268 --> 01:39:52.895
<i>I'm sure you've heard tall tales.</i>

01:39:52.969 --> 01:39:54.527
<i>- Bricks Marlin.
- This isn't right.</i>

01:39:54.638 --> 01:39:57.038
<i>- I just wanna hear your story.
- It's all there.</i>

01:39:57.107 --> 01:40:00.565
<i>- I'm tellin' it straight.
- Some guy in California called Redfoot.</i>

01:40:00.644 --> 01:40:03.135
<i>- A gift from Mr. Soze.
- Talk to me.</i>

01:40:03.213 --> 01:40:06.273
<i>- What about Redfoot?
- Mr. Redfoot knew nothing.</i>

01:40:06.349 --> 01:40:09.318
<i>- Using pawns...
- A big fat guy. Like, orca fat.</i>

01:40:09.386 --> 01:40:11.115
<i>There was a lawyer...</i>

01:40:11.488 --> 01:40:12.887
<i>Kobayashi...</i>

01:40:13.323 --> 01:40:16.451
<i>When I was picking beans in Guatemala 
we made fresh coffee.</i>

01:40:16.593 --> 01:40:19.528
<i>- I know you thought he was a good man.
- I know he was good.</i>

01:40:21.932 --> 01:40:24.833
<i>- You tell me every last detail.
- The strangest thing.</i>

01:40:24.901 --> 01:40:26.835
<i>How do you shoot the Devil in the back?</i>

01:40:26.903 --> 01:40:30.134
<i>This guy is protected 
from up on high by the Prince of...</i>

01:40:30.240 --> 01:40:32.538
<i>What's your story, pretzel man?</i>

01:40:32.609 --> 01:40:34.440
<i>- There was a lawyer.
- What lawyer?</i>

01:40:34.511 --> 01:40:35.671
<i>I am Mr. Kobayashi.</i>

01:40:35.745 --> 01:40:39.272
<i>- Kobayashi. Kobayashi.
- Tell me every last detail.</i>

01:40:39.349 --> 01:40:42.580
<i>- I work for Keyser Soze.
- Convince me. Convince me.</i>

01:40:57.868 --> 01:41:00.496
<i>Every creep and scumbag
that works the street...</i>

01:41:00.570 --> 01:41:02.663
<i>will know the name of Verbal Kint.</i>

01:41:03.306 --> 01:41:04.796
The cripple, did you see him?

01:41:04.875 --> 01:41:07.969
- The cripple! Which way did he go?
- He went out that way.

01:41:08.044 --> 01:41:10.638
<i>I know you know something.
I know you're not telling...</i>

01:41:10.714 --> 01:41:11.874
<i>I'm smarter than you...</i>

01:41:11.948 --> 01:41:14.439
<i>and I'm gonna find out
whether you like it or not.</i>

01:41:14.518 --> 01:41:16.418
<i>To a cop, the explanation
is never complicated.</i>

01:41:16.486 --> 01:41:18.078
<i>- It's always simple.
- The truth!</i>

01:41:18.155 --> 01:41:21.090
<i>There's no arch-criminal behind it all.</i>

01:41:21.158 --> 01:41:23.991
<i>Somebody with power,
somebody who is capable...</i>

01:41:24.194 --> 01:41:25.786
<i>Keyser Soze!</i>

01:41:26.563 --> 01:41:29.828
<i>You think a guy like that
gets this close to getting caught...</i>

01:41:29.966 --> 01:41:31.934
<i>and sticks his head out?</i>

01:41:32.836 --> 01:41:35.862
<i>Because you're stupid.
Because you're a cripple.</i>

01:41:35.939 --> 01:41:38.100
<i>What I wanna know is, who's the gimp?</i>

01:41:38.175 --> 01:41:40.507
<i>You've known the whole fuckin' time!</i>

01:41:40.577 --> 01:41:44.206
<i>If he comes up for anything it'll be for me. 
I'm sure Keaton is dead.</i>

01:41:44.281 --> 01:41:47.273
<i>I can't feel my legs, Keyser.</i>

01:41:47.450 --> 01:41:49.850
<i>First thing I learned on the job.
You know what?</i>

01:41:49.986 --> 01:41:53.444
<i>- How to spot a murderer.
- You got the cripple in there?</i>

01:41:53.523 --> 01:41:56.287
<i>- Did he mention Keyser Soze?
- Who?</i>

01:41:56.526 --> 01:41:58.050
<i>After that...</i>

01:41:58.528 --> 01:42:01.554
<i>my guess is you'll never hear 
from him again.</i>

01:42:22.085 --> 01:42:24.383
<i>The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled...</i>

01:42:24.554 --> 01:42:27.284
<i>was convincing the world he didn't exist.</i>

01:42:29.159 --> 01:42:30.319
<i>And like that...</i>

01:42:32.028 --> 01:42:33.359
<i>he's gone.</i>

01:42:34.305 --> 01:42:40.752
