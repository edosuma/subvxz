01:00.686 --> 01:02.688
Van Varenberg!

01:05.065 --> 01:07.526
Van Varenberg!

01:08.861 --> 01:10.863
Van Varenberg!

01:12.907 --> 01:15.534
Van Varenberg.

01:31.675 --> 01:33.969
Are you listening to me, JC?

01:34.011 --> 01:36.347
You could've
gotten us all killed.

01:36.388 --> 01:38.349
If your cover had been blown...

01:38.390 --> 01:40.351
It wasn't.

01:44.855 --> 01:46.899
Okay, I'm sorry.

01:46.941 --> 01:48.317
I was kind of stupid.

01:48.359 --> 01:50.903
Um, you're right.

01:50.945 --> 01:52.238
But I took care of it.

01:52.279 --> 01:54.073
Yeah.

01:54.114 --> 01:57.326
By detonating
an entire city block.

01:57.368 --> 01:58.661
Subtle.

02:00.579 --> 02:03.916
You're lucky the blast
didn't destroy the tracker.

02:06.043 --> 02:08.336
My explosion was too big.

02:10.923 --> 02:14.510
That's why you punish me
with N-Word Jim.

02:14.552 --> 02:15.803
Hmm?

02:17.638 --> 02:20.558
Okay.

02:20.599 --> 02:23.435
First of all, don't call
him that; it's offensive.

02:23.477 --> 02:25.855
What? Jim?

02:25.896 --> 02:27.314
The other part.

02:27.356 --> 02:30.526
Also, his name is Victor.

02:30.568 --> 02:32.278
And I wasn't punishing you.

02:32.319 --> 02:34.697
He offered me a kindness.

02:34.738 --> 02:36.407
When I really needed one.

02:40.703 --> 02:43.289
The can you put the tracker in
ended up in a garage

02:43.330 --> 02:44.874
just outside of town.

02:44.915 --> 02:46.792
Turns out it's a local
street racing spot,

02:46.834 --> 02:49.628
which means our guys are
probably selling HK there.

02:49.670 --> 02:52.756
My plan is to go check it out
tonight, find the boss,

02:52.798 --> 02:56.051
-and follow him up the ladder.
-Great. I'll come.

02:56.093 --> 02:58.804
No. You're way too high-profile
for that kind of thing.

02:58.846 --> 03:00.431
I'll go and report back.

03:00.472 --> 03:03.642
And what about
the microchip I found?

03:06.854 --> 03:09.398
-This?
-Looks important.

03:09.440 --> 03:12.443
Why would a drug dealer
have a computer chip?

03:12.484 --> 03:13.736
Huh?

03:14.987 --> 03:17.197
What year do you think it is?

03:17.239 --> 03:19.700
Look at this thing,
it's the size of my phone.

03:21.493 --> 03:23.162
It's outdated.

03:23.203 --> 03:25.289
Okay.

03:25.331 --> 03:29.335
Just lay low
for a few days, okay?

03:29.376 --> 03:32.796
But, uh, Vanessa?

03:32.838 --> 03:34.673
Vanessa?

03:41.055 --> 03:43.098
Go.

03:43.140 --> 03:45.100
He's not ready.
You need to pull him.

03:45.142 --> 03:47.144
Well, you know I can't do that.

03:47.186 --> 03:48.938
He's gonna get someone killed.

03:48.979 --> 03:50.439
He's gonna get
himself killed.

03:50.481 --> 03:52.066
I talked Brown down.

03:52.107 --> 03:54.109
There's no one else.

03:56.278 --> 03:58.614
-There's me.
-Oh.

03:58.656 --> 04:00.157
Vanessa.

04:00.199 --> 04:02.201
You know that's not
how this thing works.

04:02.242 --> 04:03.535
I'm ready.

04:03.577 --> 04:05.329
Please.

04:05.371 --> 04:07.331
You have your role.

04:07.373 --> 04:10.250
You think JC's just gonna
let you into the field?

04:10.292 --> 04:11.794
Get himself killed
deader than dead

04:11.835 --> 04:13.379
trying to protect you.

04:13.420 --> 04:14.505
I don't need protection.

04:14.546 --> 04:17.216
I know you don't, dear.

04:17.257 --> 04:19.009
But I can't change the man.

04:19.051 --> 04:20.761
You know that
better than anyone.

04:22.096 --> 04:23.847
I do.

04:29.937 --> 04:31.647
I'd rather have lobster.

04:38.278 --> 04:39.697
Huck!

04:39.738 --> 04:42.574
Huck! Help me!

04:42.616 --> 04:45.202
Please, man, help!

04:45.244 --> 04:46.912
Come on!

04:46.954 --> 04:49.123
I know Tom's paintbrush
is important to you, Huck,

04:49.164 --> 04:50.416
but she's gone!

04:52.584 --> 04:54.420
You got to let her go!

04:54.461 --> 04:56.755
Please!

04:56.797 --> 04:58.632
You can find another paintbrush!

05:01.969 --> 05:03.762
I don't want another paintbrush!

05:03.804 --> 05:05.472
Okay. And-- okay.

05:05.514 --> 05:07.891
Cut. Cut. Cut.

05:07.933 --> 05:10.853
Um... is he fucking ad-libbing?

05:10.894 --> 05:14.064
Okay.
Hey, JC, remember, you're gonna

05:14.106 --> 05:16.108
toss the paintbrush,

05:16.150 --> 05:18.861
and grab Jim's hand, 'cause it's
a big-- it's a big moment.

05:18.902 --> 05:20.237
All right?
You're saving his life.

05:20.279 --> 05:21.530
Got it.

05:21.572 --> 05:22.698
-Yes.
-Sorry.

05:22.740 --> 05:23.782
Ah, it's all right.

05:23.824 --> 05:25.743
All right, let's go again.

05:25.784 --> 05:27.369
Roll camera!

05:27.411 --> 05:29.496
You okay, man?

05:29.538 --> 05:30.873
We cool?

05:30.914 --> 05:32.207
From last night?

05:32.249 --> 05:34.293
Yeah, we cool.

05:36.128 --> 05:38.881
Action!

05:40.382 --> 05:42.426
Huck!

05:42.468 --> 05:44.094
Help me!

05:44.136 --> 05:45.929
Please!

05:45.971 --> 05:47.598
You got to let her go!

05:47.639 --> 05:49.475
You can find another paintbrush!

05:49.516 --> 05:52.394
Yeah! Take my hand!

05:52.436 --> 05:53.812
Come on!

05:53.854 --> 05:56.398
A little closer.

05:56.440 --> 05:58.233
Come on!

05:58.275 --> 06:00.069
Just grab my hand.

06:00.110 --> 06:01.904
Grab my fucking hand.

06:01.945 --> 06:03.906
Oh, God...

06:03.947 --> 06:05.324
JC, are you fucking serious?

06:05.365 --> 06:06.575
Cut!

06:06.617 --> 06:08.035
VD, hey, buddy.

06:08.077 --> 06:09.995
Uh, sweetheart, can I get wipey
for my sneakers?

06:10.037 --> 06:12.081
Thank you. Um, buddy, buddy,

06:12.122 --> 06:13.582
what's going on, man?
You're giving me flashbacks

06:13.624 --> 06:15.542
to the Van Buren balloon scene.

06:15.584 --> 06:16.877
What's happening here?

06:16.919 --> 06:19.588
You're not yourself.

06:19.630 --> 06:21.548
I've been getting that a lot.

06:21.590 --> 06:23.133
Okay. Okay.

06:24.343 --> 06:26.845
You're hurting, I can see that.

06:26.887 --> 06:28.138
Tell me why you're hurting.

06:30.099 --> 06:32.351
Um...

06:32.392 --> 06:35.020
There she is. Hey, sweetie.

06:35.062 --> 06:36.522
It's about Victor.

06:37.773 --> 06:39.149
What about him?

06:39.191 --> 06:41.610
It's, um... his, um...

06:44.822 --> 06:47.116
...his character.

06:47.157 --> 06:50.035
It... you know, offends me.

06:51.286 --> 06:52.788
N-- N-word Jim. Okay.

06:52.830 --> 06:54.581
What about N-Word Jim

06:54.623 --> 06:56.083
offends you?

07:01.255 --> 07:03.507
His name.

07:03.549 --> 07:06.051
-"Jim"?
-No, the other part.

07:06.093 --> 07:08.762
Well, I mean, obviously,
we can't call him N...

07:10.305 --> 07:11.723
I mean, I mean,
we can't call him

07:11.765 --> 07:15.352
"N-Word Jim," so,
that's, you know...

07:15.394 --> 07:16.603
Yeah, you're right.

07:16.645 --> 07:19.481
...not cool.

07:19.523 --> 07:22.526
So what about another name?

07:22.568 --> 07:24.444
-Can we change it?
-To what?

07:24.486 --> 07:26.029
-Jim.
-Jim.

07:26.071 --> 07:29.032
Yeah, but, see, then we
undermine his entire experience

07:29.074 --> 07:31.368
as a black man
in pre-Civil War America.

07:31.410 --> 07:33.162
Right?

07:33.203 --> 07:35.497
Yeah, okay.
Listen, buddy, um,

07:35.539 --> 07:38.041
there's a lot of pressure,
I can see it right here.

07:38.083 --> 07:39.418
You need to take a steppie back

07:39.459 --> 07:41.295
from the role for a minnie,
all right?

07:41.336 --> 07:42.754
You know what?

07:42.796 --> 07:45.299
You and me...
are gonna hit the town tonight.

07:45.340 --> 07:47.176
Get crunked,

07:47.217 --> 07:48.969
let loose those doggies.

07:49.011 --> 07:51.221
What do you think?
What do you think about that?

07:51.263 --> 07:52.472
-I cannot.
-No.

07:52.514 --> 07:53.724
I've got some plans.

07:53.765 --> 07:55.851
Hey, thank you so much.

07:57.060 --> 07:58.478
Thank you.

08:00.898 --> 08:03.859
Can I get a fuckin' wipey
for my sneakers, please?

08:03.901 --> 08:06.653
Luis!

08:06.695 --> 08:08.530
I need your help.

08:08.572 --> 08:10.616
With what?

08:42.397 --> 08:44.399
We couldn't find a better car?

08:44.441 --> 08:48.153
-It's all I could afford
with your per diem. -Oh.

08:48.195 --> 08:50.656
You should have told me
you can't drive stick.

08:50.697 --> 08:53.492
I'm... I'm getting
the hang of it.

08:59.665 --> 09:01.166
Wait, stop it.

09:13.136 --> 09:14.513
Feel that?

09:14.554 --> 09:17.182
What's the plan?
What's the plan?

09:17.224 --> 09:20.352
Someone here is moving the HK.

09:20.394 --> 09:22.104
We'll find out who it is,

09:22.145 --> 09:24.523
set up a buy.

09:24.564 --> 09:25.941
Classic Johnson.

09:25.983 --> 09:28.527
In the Cartel,

09:28.568 --> 09:32.614
the biggest players
had the shiniest toys.

09:47.921 --> 09:49.673
It's happening.

09:58.098 --> 09:59.641
This is a private area.

09:59.683 --> 10:01.518
Go party somewhere else.

10:01.560 --> 10:03.854
Hey.

10:03.895 --> 10:05.147
Hey!

10:05.188 --> 10:07.274
Look at me.

10:08.525 --> 10:10.694
Look at me.

10:12.863 --> 10:15.032
Look at me.

10:15.073 --> 10:18.452
Do I look...
like I come to party?

10:21.663 --> 10:23.123
Look at me.

10:29.338 --> 10:32.466
Go! Go, please!

10:32.507 --> 10:33.550
Shit!

10:39.306 --> 10:43.226
This is my world.
I got this.

10:49.524 --> 10:51.568
Hey!

10:51.610 --> 10:53.153
I want to buy drugs.

10:56.782 --> 10:59.117
Oh yeah?

10:59.159 --> 11:01.661
Yeah.

11:01.703 --> 11:05.248
What you in the market for,
old man?

11:05.290 --> 11:08.710
I don't know, maybe some
heroin cut with Ketamine?

11:08.752 --> 11:12.798
Kids call it HK...
Hong Kong.

11:12.839 --> 11:14.091
Yeah.

11:28.563 --> 11:30.732
20,000 Lev.

11:30.774 --> 11:32.609
10,000 Euro.

11:32.651 --> 11:37.280
I'm looking to get a much...

11:37.322 --> 11:39.408
larger purchase.

11:41.785 --> 11:43.328
How much larger?

11:43.370 --> 11:46.081
100 cans. Yeah.

11:52.421 --> 11:54.714
A deal like that...

11:54.756 --> 11:57.008
would have to through
the big boss.

11:57.050 --> 12:00.303
If that's what it takes,
it's okay.

12:00.345 --> 12:02.097
How come I've never
seen you before?

12:02.139 --> 12:05.308
Oh, believe me...

12:05.350 --> 12:07.686
you've seen me before.

12:09.438 --> 12:11.565
Doesn't feel right.

12:11.606 --> 12:14.860
Get your fix somewhere else,
grandpa.

12:38.550 --> 12:39.634
Hey.

12:41.094 --> 12:43.013
I'll race you for it.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.726
You'll race me for it!

12:49.728 --> 12:51.480
Yeah.

12:53.315 --> 12:55.609
So let me get this straight:

12:55.650 --> 12:57.819
you want to race me...

12:57.861 --> 13:01.615
in that piece of shit car.

13:02.616 --> 13:03.783
That's right.

13:03.825 --> 13:07.412
If you win, I-I sell you HK.
Sure, okay.

13:07.454 --> 13:09.915
-Good.
-But what's in it for me?

13:09.956 --> 13:15.086
You can use me
to do your evil bidding,

13:15.128 --> 13:18.215
like in Universal Soldier,

13:18.256 --> 13:20.759
starring Jean-Claude Van Damme.

13:20.800 --> 13:24.221
Or you can keep me in your barn,

13:24.262 --> 13:26.932
and use me as your mechanic.

13:26.973 --> 13:30.560
Like Nowhere to Run.

13:30.602 --> 13:33.021
Also starring
Jean-Claude Van Damme.

13:34.648 --> 13:37.400
Or you can hunt me for sport,
like in Hard Target.

13:38.735 --> 13:40.445
Starring Jean-Claude Van Damme.

13:40.487 --> 13:42.280
Right?

13:42.322 --> 13:46.368
Like I said, you can do
whatever you want.

13:46.409 --> 13:50.205
I do like the sound
of that last one.

13:50.247 --> 13:51.456
You're on!

15:17.292 --> 15:20.837
Johnson, this idea is terrible.

15:22.547 --> 15:24.132
I've raced before.

15:24.174 --> 15:25.800
With Mario Lopez's Lotus.

15:25.842 --> 15:27.385
Very fast.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.304
You're the worst driver
I've ever seen.

15:29.346 --> 15:32.599
And this isn't a regular race,
this is a drift race.

15:32.641 --> 15:33.933
A "drift race"?

15:33.975 --> 15:35.477
A drift race.

15:35.518 --> 15:37.145
What's a drift, Luis?

15:37.187 --> 15:39.022
A drift. A drift race.

15:39.064 --> 15:40.607
It doesn't matter.

15:45.111 --> 15:46.696
Okay. Listen.

15:46.738 --> 15:48.239
Johnson.

15:48.281 --> 15:50.116
Abort this. Please.

15:50.158 --> 15:51.910
You're going to lose.

16:32.242 --> 16:33.868
What are you doing?

16:35.495 --> 16:38.790
I learned a trick,
long time ago.

16:38.832 --> 16:41.626
When one sense is gone,

16:41.668 --> 16:44.963
the others heightened.

16:45.004 --> 16:48.800
I don't think
that applies to vision

16:48.842 --> 16:51.177
when driving.

16:52.971 --> 16:55.515
Oh, fuck!

16:55.557 --> 16:57.809
I like it, old man!

16:57.851 --> 16:59.894
You got balls!

17:04.858 --> 17:06.818
This just got a whole lot worse.

17:06.859 --> 17:08.694
We need to abort.

17:08.737 --> 17:11.823
Oh, everything
will be fine, Luis.

17:11.865 --> 17:13.575
Trust me.

17:14.784 --> 17:17.537
Fuck.

17:36.347 --> 17:38.767
Pochutvayte rituma.

17:38.808 --> 17:41.686
Pochustvayte kak se rimuva.

17:47.901 --> 17:49.110

17:49.986 --> 17:51.946

19:35.425 --> 19:36.426
Oh, fuck.

20:00.450 --> 20:01.993
Heh-heh...

20:02.035 --> 20:03.536
Uh...

20:05.413 --> 20:07.415
Go.

20:07.457 --> 20:08.875
What happened?

20:08.917 --> 20:10.293
I'll explain later. Go.

20:10.335 --> 20:11.753
Where's Vanessa?

20:11.794 --> 20:13.504
She must have left,
I didn't see her.

20:13.546 --> 20:15.590
We need to go. -I know.

20:15.632 --> 20:18.551
Ah, sorry.

20:18.593 --> 20:20.011
Go, go.

20:20.053 --> 20:22.221
I'll explain later.
We have to go now.

20:27.810 --> 20:29.395
Sorry.

20:30.980 --> 20:32.774
Jean-Claude.
Jean-Claude, please.

20:32.815 --> 20:34.192
Relax, relax.

20:34.233 --> 20:36.194
I'm sorry, guys.

20:36.235 --> 20:38.988
-JC, we have to go.
-I'm sorry.

20:39.030 --> 20:41.282
-Go!
-Sorry.

20:41.324 --> 20:43.076
Let's go, let's go. Yes!

20:57.256 --> 21:00.468
Oh, shit! That's...

21:00.510 --> 21:02.345
-Hi!
-Oh, oh, come here,

21:02.387 --> 21:04.222
-come on, I'll introduce you.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. -No!

21:04.263 --> 21:06.224
-I can't believe it. -Yeah,
yeah, yeah. JC, hold on, bae.

21:06.265 --> 21:08.810
I need-- you need to meet
our foreign financier.

21:08.851 --> 21:12.939
This is Dragan... Molo-Molotov.

21:12.981 --> 21:14.899
-Nice to meet you. -Moltov.
-Ugh, this guy's amazing.

21:14.941 --> 21:18.653
He, he's got the largest
cell phone company in Bulgaria.

21:18.695 --> 21:20.321
-He's got second largest...
-It's first now. First.

21:20.363 --> 21:23.491
-First. -Second largest,
uh, track pants manufacturer,

21:23.533 --> 21:25.410
-and the eighth...
-Seventh now, seventh.

21:25.451 --> 21:28.204
Seventh largest laserdisc...

21:28.246 --> 21:29.622
It's technology,
it's new technology.

21:29.664 --> 21:31.958
Who cares about me?
I am so pleased

21:32.000 --> 21:33.710
you are on this production.

21:33.751 --> 21:35.628
And Krisztina?
She's thrilled

21:35.670 --> 21:36.796
-to be working with you.
-Yeah.

21:36.838 --> 21:39.257
She's absolutely thrilled.

21:39.298 --> 21:40.842
Would you like a drink?

21:40.883 --> 21:42.677
-With us?
-No, I've got to go.

21:42.719 --> 21:45.221
But I will see you around.
Anyways, nice to meet you.

21:45.263 --> 21:46.597
Yeah, early morning. Fucking...

21:46.639 --> 21:49.851
I will be seeing you.

21:49.892 --> 21:51.477
Look at him.

21:51.519 --> 21:53.521
-He's so right, so tight.
-Look at him walk.

21:53.563 --> 21:55.732
-So fucking tight.
-He exercises, I think, but...

21:55.773 --> 21:58.359
I... I am emotional, you know?

21:58.401 --> 22:00.611
You guys want
to do some bumps?

22:00.653 --> 22:03.448
-Yeah.
-Sure.

22:05.324 --> 22:07.452
It's over.

22:07.493 --> 22:10.288
I should have listened
to everyone.

22:10.329 --> 22:12.331
I'm not ready.

22:15.418 --> 22:17.837
You took the job.

22:17.879 --> 22:20.006
You have to finish.

22:20.048 --> 22:23.885
It's just a drug cartel, Luis.

22:23.926 --> 22:27.305
It's not like they're going
to take over the world.

22:27.346 --> 22:29.348
That doesn't matter.

22:32.852 --> 22:35.354
You make the world
a better place.

22:38.232 --> 22:39.901
It's your calling, JC.

22:39.942 --> 22:42.320
You can't turn your back
on your calling.

22:43.696 --> 22:46.866
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

22:57.126 --> 22:59.337
Wait. JC.

22:59.378 --> 23:02.548
JC. You have to tell Vanessa
you're leaving.

23:05.384 --> 23:07.345
Why?

23:07.386 --> 23:12.016
She didn't want me to take
the job in the first place.

23:12.058 --> 23:14.811
You're really going
to leave again

23:14.852 --> 23:16.479
without saying good-bye?

23:23.236 --> 23:25.196
Yeah.

27:57.551 --> 28:00.805
Um, Vanessa...

28:00.846 --> 28:02.765
You need to see this.

28:02.807 --> 28:04.433
What?

28:04.475 --> 28:07.436
-I hooked up the microchip
you found... -Yeah.

28:07.478 --> 28:08.938
...ran its core directive

28:08.979 --> 28:11.065
and pushed it
through a small amplifier.

28:11.107 --> 28:12.233
Oh, yeah?

28:12.274 --> 28:13.776
And this happened.

28:19.198 --> 28:21.033
You know what this is.

28:21.075 --> 28:23.911
A weather control device.

28:23.953 --> 28:25.413
There's only one reason

28:25.454 --> 28:28.416
they would build
a weather control device.

28:28.457 --> 28:31.127
To take over the world.
