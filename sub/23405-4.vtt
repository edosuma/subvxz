00:07.716 --> 00:10.468
Nate over bullhorn:
<i>Sir. Excuse me, sir.</i>

00:10.552 --> 00:14.889
Sir! I need you
to put your hands up
where I can see them.

00:14.973 --> 00:17.726
- ( Joel scoffs )
- Nate: Higher.

00:17.809 --> 00:20.270
- Joel: What the fuck?
- Mm, that's good.

00:20.353 --> 00:24.149
<i>Ma'am, pull his trousers</i>
<i>down around his knees.</i>

00:26.067 --> 00:28.361
- Ah! ( laughing )
- Joel: Nate!

00:28.445 --> 00:31.823
- ( laughs )
-<i> Whoa, what the heck, man?</i>

00:31.906 --> 00:33.450
- Dude!
-<i> ( car door closes )</i>

00:33.533 --> 00:36.578
Joel freaking Hurley.
( laughs )

00:36.661 --> 00:38.997
- Here in Summit, Utah.
- ( laughs )

00:39.080 --> 00:40.373
Come here, man.

00:40.457 --> 00:41.750
- Come here.
- Good to see you.

00:41.833 --> 00:44.627
Man, I never thought
I'd see you here again.

00:44.711 --> 00:48.131
- Well.
- And I'm gonna have
to ask the two of you

00:48.214 --> 00:50.425
to step off
this property,

00:50.508 --> 00:53.386
which is technically
a crime scene.

00:53.470 --> 00:55.305
Which she should know,

00:55.388 --> 00:58.308
'cause I've kind of,
like, told her already
three times.

00:58.391 --> 00:59.809
So, you guys
know each other?

00:59.893 --> 01:01.686
Ah, more or less.

01:01.770 --> 01:03.271
Mostly less.

01:03.354 --> 01:05.940
- But, yeah, if you--
-<i> ( door closes )</i>

01:08.318 --> 01:10.445
- Oh, hey!
- Alan:<i> Hey.</i>

01:10.528 --> 01:11.905
It's all right,
it's all right.

01:11.988 --> 01:15.742
It's just
a nostalgia thing.

01:15.825 --> 01:17.452
You remember
Joel Hurley.

01:17.535 --> 01:19.120
<i>He used to live here.</i>

01:20.413 --> 01:21.706
Looks familiar.

01:21.790 --> 01:24.334
-<i> Alan Pape.</i>
<i>How are you?</i>
- Good.

01:24.417 --> 01:27.253
<i>I assume you folks</i>
<i>saw the yellow tape</i>
<i>bottom of the drive?</i>

01:27.337 --> 01:29.214
Petra:<i> We came,</i>
<i>actually, the other way.</i>
<i>Sorry about that.</i>

01:29.297 --> 01:32.675
You were the detective
in charge four years ago.

01:32.759 --> 01:35.428
- Alan:<i> Do I know you?</i>
- No, we never met.

01:35.512 --> 01:37.889
Nate:
So, guys, both of you,

01:37.972 --> 01:40.225
<i>I need you</i>
<i>off the property now.</i>

01:40.308 --> 01:42.101
Alan:
<i>Yeah, I hate</i>
<i>to be a hard-ass,</i>

01:42.185 --> 01:44.854
<i>but we got press crawling</i>
<i>up out of the ground</i>
<i>like worms.</i>

01:44.938 --> 01:46.523
Folks up on the hill
just trying

01:46.606 --> 01:48.817
to enjoy a modicum
of privacy.

01:50.652 --> 01:52.278
- If you, uh...
- Of course.

01:52.362 --> 01:53.738
Nate:
<i>Alan.</i>

01:59.577 --> 02:01.496
Listen, don't worry
about Alan.

02:01.579 --> 02:03.456
He's just doing
his job.

02:03.540 --> 02:05.875
He knows where
his bread is buttered.

02:05.959 --> 02:09.379
That doesn't
mean it was smart
to bring him up here.

02:09.462 --> 02:11.881
Joel, on a lighter note,

02:11.965 --> 02:15.426
you'll never guess
who I literally just left
to come up here.

02:15.510 --> 02:19.097
- Oh, yeah?
- He's a Virgo,
he hates long lines.

02:19.180 --> 02:22.684
- ( chuckles )
- He loves leisurely walks
in the rain

02:22.767 --> 02:25.186
- and Italian cuisine.
- Huh.

02:25.270 --> 02:27.063
Nate:
Actually, I don't know
if any of those are true.

02:27.146 --> 02:28.857
<i>I don't even know</i>
<i>if he's a Virgo.</i>

02:28.940 --> 02:31.192
-<i> ( chatter )</i>
-<i> ( dishes clanking )</i>

02:35.029 --> 02:37.782
Joel:
No fucking way!
Frank!

02:37.866 --> 02:39.617
- ( laughs ) Ahem.
- Nate: Hey, Frank!

02:39.701 --> 02:42.078
Joel:
Yeah!

02:42.161 --> 02:44.414
( exhales )
Okay. Ahem.

02:44.497 --> 02:45.999
- Hey, buddy!
- Hey, no way!

02:46.082 --> 02:47.542
- No way.
- Look at that beard.

02:47.625 --> 02:50.879
Look who I found
trolling for hookers
by the interchange.

02:50.962 --> 02:52.547
How you guys doing?
You wanna sit down?

02:52.630 --> 02:54.382
- Heck, yeah, we're gonna sit.
- Yeah, sit down.

02:54.465 --> 02:56.509
- ( chuckles )
- Just sitting by yourself?

02:56.593 --> 02:58.094
- Yeah.
- ( both chuckling )

02:58.177 --> 03:01.347
- Oh, Frank, this is Petra.
- Oh, we met a few days ago.

03:01.431 --> 03:03.933
She's been all over me
about the night in question,

03:04.017 --> 03:05.935
the night we went to
the movies-- "Hobbit 2."

03:06.019 --> 03:08.897
Yeah, at Eastridge.
Not as good as the first.

03:08.980 --> 03:11.524
Seriously,
who names anything
"Desolation of 'Smog'"?

03:11.608 --> 03:14.402
- ( Frank chuckles )
- Nate: Smaug.

03:14.485 --> 03:16.738
- So, how's Laura?
- Joel: She's good.

03:16.821 --> 03:19.407
- Yeah,
it's a really good thing.
- You guys got married.

03:19.490 --> 03:21.200
Said he saw it
on Facebook.

03:21.284 --> 03:24.412
Yeah, we just tried
to keep it small,
just family.

03:24.495 --> 03:26.164
Hey, it's a clean break,
I get that, man.

03:26.247 --> 03:27.665
It was super clear.

03:27.749 --> 03:29.083
Everybody's fine with that.
Don't worry about that.

03:29.167 --> 03:30.585
It's fine.

03:32.170 --> 03:34.380
Well, I'm, uh--
I'm kind of done here.

03:34.464 --> 03:36.049
Joel:
<i>Well, shit.</i>

03:36.132 --> 03:38.092
I'll tell you the great thing
about being manager now--

03:38.176 --> 03:39.469
the benefits
are awesome.

03:39.552 --> 03:42.263
Like, I get to leave
super late

03:42.347 --> 03:44.891
and I get to arrive
super early.

03:44.974 --> 03:47.477
( laughing )

03:47.560 --> 03:49.145
Frank:
<i>How long are you here?</i>
<i>We've gotta hang out.</i>

03:49.228 --> 03:51.814
Just a couple of days.
Yeah, we should definitely
hang out.

03:51.898 --> 03:54.108
<i>You wanna make a plan now?</i>
<i>Should I give you a call or...?</i>

03:54.192 --> 03:55.485
<i>We'll hang out now</i>
<i>if you want to.</i>

03:55.568 --> 03:57.445
<i>Wanna hang out now?</i>
<i>Or not.</i>

03:57.528 --> 03:59.781
-<i> If you're busy,</i>
<i>I can-- whatever.</i>
- Ahem.

03:59.864 --> 04:02.158
<i>Whatever you want is fine.</i>
<i>We don't have to hang out</i>
<i>at all if you're busy.</i>

04:02.241 --> 04:03.576
-<i> I understand.</i>
- No, I'm-- I'm just
a little fried,

04:03.660 --> 04:05.828
but, uh,
you taking off?

04:05.912 --> 04:07.038
Yeah.
You want a ride?

04:07.121 --> 04:08.498
<i>Yeah,</i>
<i>that'd be good.</i>

04:08.581 --> 04:10.458
-<i> That good</i>
<i>with you guys?</i>
- Great.

04:10.541 --> 04:12.502
- Great.
- Frank:<i> Good, yeah!</i>

04:12.585 --> 04:14.253
-<i> I'll give you a ride.</i>
- Like old times.

04:14.337 --> 04:16.422
-<i> Yes, oh, yeah.</i>
- ( both chuckling )

04:18.049 --> 04:20.343
Well, I'll see you guys--
see you guys later.

04:20.426 --> 04:22.387
- Nate:<i> Yeah.</i>
<i>Another day.</i>
- Another day.

04:22.470 --> 04:25.348
Another day.
Let me, uh-- I gotta
settle up here.

04:25.431 --> 04:28.685
<i>And I have a sour</i>
<i>piece of news.</i>

04:28.768 --> 04:31.479
- Nate: Hmm?
- In my car and not
in my pocket is...

04:31.562 --> 04:33.231
-<i> Frank, Frank, come on.</i>
- ...my wallet.

04:33.314 --> 04:34.232
Thank you.

04:36.150 --> 04:38.069
- Get out of here.
- I'll, uh-- I'll text you
tomorrow.

04:38.152 --> 04:39.487
- Great.
- ( clears throat )

04:39.570 --> 04:41.406
- Joel: Man.
- Frank: Yeah, I know.

04:41.489 --> 04:45.952
-<i> Get out of town.</i>
-<i> I know, man.</i>
<i>Is this nuts or what?</i>

04:46.035 --> 04:48.621
Frank:
It's been, what,
four, five years now?

04:51.290 --> 04:53.084
Nate:
Frank's subtle.

04:53.167 --> 04:54.335
Mm.

04:55.962 --> 04:59.257
So, what's the deal
with Alan?

05:00.717 --> 05:02.969
Alan? Okay.

05:03.052 --> 05:05.346
Here's what you need
to know about Alan.

05:05.430 --> 05:08.182
30 years,
he worked for
the whole town.

05:08.266 --> 05:10.601
Population: 36,000.

05:10.685 --> 05:12.729
Drove the same
Chevy Malibu.

05:12.812 --> 05:14.439
<i>Last three years,</i>

05:14.522 --> 05:17.567
<i>he has worked</i>
<i>for 12 families</i>

05:17.650 --> 05:19.861
<i>and is on</i>
<i>his second Porsche,</i>

05:19.944 --> 05:23.990
<i>which he just loves</i>
<i>to drive around past us.</i>

05:25.742 --> 05:28.995
I'm glad
you're good, man.

05:29.078 --> 05:31.831
You look like the guy I met
when you first got to town.

05:31.914 --> 05:34.459
( both chuckling )

05:34.542 --> 05:38.546
- Well, my job
is pretty physical.
-<i> Mm-hmm.</i>

05:38.629 --> 05:41.549
<i>A lot of that's the gym,</i>
<i>though, too, isn't it?</i>

05:41.632 --> 05:44.260
<i>Isn't it?</i>
<i>Come on.</i>

05:44.343 --> 05:46.596
- Yeah, I supplement.
-<i> Uh-huh.</i>

05:46.679 --> 05:48.639
<i>But most of it's,</i>
<i>you know, whatever.</i>

05:48.723 --> 05:50.600
Whatever.
( chuckles )

05:50.683 --> 05:53.478
You said you
were working where,
some kind of hunting thing?

05:53.561 --> 05:56.731
Yeah, my uncle
has this, uh--
he has an outfit.

05:56.814 --> 05:58.232
It's-- it's nice.

05:58.316 --> 06:01.027
Uh, yeah.

06:01.110 --> 06:03.446
Clean air.
Nice.

06:03.529 --> 06:06.532
And Laura's working
for a doctor, is that right?

06:06.616 --> 06:08.409
<i>Yeah.</i>

06:08.493 --> 06:09.994
Big contrast.

06:11.996 --> 06:14.248
What are you
getting at with that?

06:14.332 --> 06:17.835
Oh, nothing, nothing.
Just... nothing.

06:17.919 --> 06:20.630
<i>Have you met the guy?</i>
<i>Is he a nice guy, though?</i>

06:20.713 --> 06:22.799
I don't know.
I mean, he flies to Bolivia

06:22.882 --> 06:25.301
and does cleft palates
for free.

06:25.384 --> 06:26.427
<i>Ah.</i>

06:26.511 --> 06:29.472
( chuckles )
So he does boobs and Botox

06:29.555 --> 06:31.891
to pay for his Mercedes,
is that it?

06:31.974 --> 06:34.894
- ( both laughing )
-<i> That sounds about right.</i>

06:34.977 --> 06:37.480
Eh, I don't know
what he drives.

06:37.563 --> 06:40.483
<i>It looks like he had</i>
<i>a very nice Christmas</i>
<i>party, though.</i>

06:43.945 --> 06:45.905
I saw it in a post
Laura did.

06:47.907 --> 06:49.909
<i>Office party,</i>
<i>it looked like.</i>

06:51.202 --> 06:52.537
<i>I didn't</i>
<i>see you in it.</i>

06:54.372 --> 06:55.665
Yeah, I don't know.

06:55.748 --> 06:57.708
I think I had
a work thing or something.

06:59.252 --> 07:00.753
I don't remember.

07:03.381 --> 07:07.552
Look, man, the Laura thing,
it actually is kind of
really great.

07:08.928 --> 07:10.096
<i>The movies thing,</i>
<i>that was--</i>

07:10.179 --> 07:11.347
I get it.

07:11.430 --> 07:12.515
-<i> No, seriously--</i>
- I get it.

07:12.598 --> 07:13.850
I get it.

07:13.933 --> 07:15.685
<i>I didn't</i>
<i>say anything.</i>

07:17.061 --> 07:18.146
<i>We were</i>
<i>at the movies.</i>

07:22.483 --> 07:24.152
Cool.

07:24.235 --> 07:26.320
It's just I never
told Laura about her.

07:28.698 --> 07:30.366
I think
it would kill her.

07:32.243 --> 07:34.162
He said we should
stick to the story.

07:34.245 --> 07:36.080
That they're
two separate events.

07:36.164 --> 07:38.916
That us lying
about the girl has nothing
to do with the murder

07:39.000 --> 07:41.711
and that we didn't even
know about the murder

07:41.794 --> 07:43.296
<i>until after</i>
<i>we made the lie.</i>

07:43.379 --> 07:44.755
<i>So that's</i>
<i>what just happened.</i>

07:44.839 --> 07:47.884
<i>So, yeah.</i>
<i>( exhales )</i>

07:47.967 --> 07:50.052
- What was her name?
- Who?

07:50.136 --> 07:53.723
- The woman he slept with.
- I have no idea.

07:53.806 --> 07:55.725
He slept with a woman,
you picked him up
in the morning,

07:55.808 --> 07:57.894
and he never
told you her name?

07:57.977 --> 08:02.231
Why do girls think all guys
brag about their conquests?

08:02.315 --> 08:04.400
<i>Girls brag</i>
<i>way more than guys do.</i>

08:04.483 --> 08:06.694
<i>They tell each other</i>
<i>everything and they have</i>
<i>zero boundaries.</i>

08:06.777 --> 08:08.696
What about
an address?

08:08.779 --> 08:10.615
Frank, um, the morning
of New Year's,

08:10.698 --> 08:11.908
where did
you get him?

08:11.991 --> 08:13.701
<i>In town.</i>

08:13.784 --> 08:16.162
<i>Across from,</i>
<i>uh, the thing</i>
<i>with the, you know.</i>

08:16.245 --> 08:18.789
Okay, so you don't even
know where she lived.

08:18.873 --> 08:20.458
( sighs )

08:20.541 --> 08:22.168
Did you give her
your job, too?

08:22.251 --> 08:24.170
Or just this particular
investigation?

08:24.253 --> 08:26.088
It's not
an investigation.

08:26.172 --> 08:29.050
It's just
two curious people
asking questions.

08:29.133 --> 08:30.468
Frank,

08:30.551 --> 08:34.639
if you never
heard her name

08:34.722 --> 08:36.098
or saw a person

08:36.182 --> 08:38.267
and you never went
to her apartment,

08:38.351 --> 08:41.646
how do you know
there even was a woman?

08:46.525 --> 08:49.320
Okay.
( sighs )

08:49.403 --> 08:52.240
I want you to tell him
that you told us
about the night,

08:52.323 --> 08:53.824
- about the lie.
-<i> What?</i>

08:53.908 --> 08:56.369
-<i> Why?</i>
- Just do it tomorrow.

08:56.452 --> 08:58.371
I'll see if I can
get a man on it.

08:58.454 --> 09:00.915
- I probably can't, not yet.
- I'll follow him.

09:00.998 --> 09:04.669
- What are you, a team now?
- Frank, seriously, bro.

09:04.752 --> 09:06.963
You lied.

09:07.046 --> 09:09.465
Forget
just to a friend,

09:09.548 --> 09:13.052
but you lied to a friend
who's also a cop.

09:13.135 --> 09:14.971
And I'm trying
to sort through this.

09:16.389 --> 09:17.848
And I need
some space from you

09:17.932 --> 09:20.810
because Joel also
happens to be my friend.

09:22.228 --> 09:24.522
Now, here's what
I want you to do.

09:24.605 --> 09:27.650
I want you
to go to his hotel
in the morning

09:27.733 --> 09:30.653
and tell him
that you told us.

09:32.196 --> 09:33.447
If, after
Frank leaves,

09:33.531 --> 09:36.075
Joel asks to borrow
your car, call me.

09:36.158 --> 09:37.702
Stall him.

09:37.785 --> 09:40.621
Don't do anything
but call me.

09:40.705 --> 09:42.707
<i>How's Melissa?</i>
<i>Melissa's his wife.</i>

09:42.790 --> 09:45.543
They met in middle school.
Her dad's a pastor
at St. Luke's.

09:45.626 --> 09:49.046
What is your problem?

09:50.131 --> 09:52.550
<i>This is ridiculous.</i>

09:52.633 --> 09:56.053
Francis,
I need you to focus.

10:02.268 --> 10:04.312
Nate: Ta-da!

10:04.395 --> 10:05.980
Petra:
Lovely.

10:12.737 --> 10:14.030
Who knocks
at their own house?

10:14.113 --> 10:17.325
I don't know.

10:17.408 --> 10:19.702
It's just, it's--
a little weird

10:19.785 --> 10:22.163
bringing a girl home
to meet your wife.

10:22.246 --> 10:23.789
It's stupid.
I don't know.

10:28.961 --> 10:32.048
Oh, okay.
I get it.

10:33.591 --> 10:36.886
- Hi.
- Melissa:<i> Hi.</i>

10:36.969 --> 10:38.471
And he's going on
and on.

10:38.554 --> 10:40.139
"Don't worry,
she's gorgeous.

10:40.222 --> 10:42.224
There's no way she has
any interest in me."

10:42.308 --> 10:44.393
- ( chuckles )
- And what do you know,
he's right.

10:44.477 --> 10:46.562
- ( chuckles )
- Nate: What can I say?

10:46.645 --> 10:49.857
- You can either finish that
or leave the table.
- I call it like I see it.

10:49.940 --> 10:52.693
Natey told me
about your brother.

10:52.777 --> 10:55.780
- Petra:<i> Mmm.</i>
- I, uh-- I tell her
everything.

10:55.863 --> 10:57.198
Not only is she
my better half,

10:57.281 --> 11:00.743
but she's also
a police officer, so.

11:00.826 --> 11:03.537
You know, everything
stays within the cone.

11:03.621 --> 11:06.290
- Mmm.
- And your dad's away
for life, right?

11:06.374 --> 11:11.670
- He's David Neill?
- My father is David Neill,
yes.

11:11.754 --> 11:13.923
I read about
his arrest.

11:14.006 --> 11:15.800
Yanked him
out of the house
on Christmas Eve.

11:15.883 --> 11:17.551
<i>That must have been</i>

11:17.635 --> 11:20.888
<i>quite a game changer,</i>
<i>family wise.</i>

11:20.971 --> 11:23.891
<i>It was</i>
<i>a significant moment</i>
<i>in my youth.</i>

11:23.974 --> 11:27.269
Hey, eat your vegetables.

11:27.353 --> 11:28.896
<i>And your mom, is she--</i>

11:28.979 --> 11:31.524
<i>She died</i>
<i>a few months ago.</i>

11:31.607 --> 11:34.819
- Oh, she was the lady
who I met back in the day.
-<i> I'm sorry I brought that up.</i>

11:34.902 --> 11:38.572
- Petra:
<i>No, it's fine, trust me.</i>
- Apologies. Sorry.

11:38.656 --> 11:44.245
I guess--
I guess the Neill girls
got all the good genes.

11:44.328 --> 11:46.997
Not so much
with the Neill boys, so.

11:47.081 --> 11:48.457
Something like that.

11:48.541 --> 11:50.459
- ( laughing )
- Nate.

11:50.543 --> 11:52.169
Yeah?

11:52.253 --> 11:54.630
- Oh.
- We'll-- we'll be back
very soon.

11:54.713 --> 11:56.841
We're gonna need
about 15 minutes.

11:56.924 --> 11:58.634
Please sit.
Enjoy your dinner.

11:58.717 --> 12:00.428
We'll be right back, okay?

12:00.511 --> 12:02.138
Morgan?

12:02.221 --> 12:04.473
Official man-of-the-house
hat on, okay?

12:10.229 --> 12:11.772
Why?

12:11.856 --> 12:14.150
She's pretty,
she's smart,
she's funny.

12:14.233 --> 12:15.734
Melissa:
<i>She's lost.</i>

12:15.818 --> 12:17.319
Are you kidding?

12:17.403 --> 12:20.865
She is the most focused,
directed person I've ever met.

12:20.948 --> 12:23.200
<i>Yeah, well,</i>
<i>there you go.</i>

12:26.495 --> 12:29.248
-<i> ( phone ringing )</i>
-<i> It's Alan.</i>

12:32.918 --> 12:35.337
It's 10:45!

12:35.421 --> 12:38.841
- ( exhales ) But I...
-<i> ( ringing stops )</i>

12:41.719 --> 12:43.679
-<i> ( phone ringing )</i>
- Can I just say
something else?

12:43.762 --> 12:47.141
<i>Uh, no, you have exceeded</i>
<i>your quota of words</i>
<i>for the evening.</i>

12:47.224 --> 12:48.684
Well, then...

12:49.935 --> 12:52.396
let me just say I--

12:52.480 --> 12:54.815
I feel guilty.

12:54.899 --> 12:56.817
Like I'm being
untruthful.

12:56.901 --> 12:59.862
-<i> To Joel?</i>
- Yeah.

12:59.945 --> 13:02.281
<i>There's a bigger strategy</i>
<i>at work.</i>

13:02.364 --> 13:04.909
<i>You're serving</i>
<i>a bigger truth.</i>

13:04.992 --> 13:09.330
-<i> ( phone ringing )</i>
-<i> Oh, come on, Alan!</i>

13:10.789 --> 13:11.999
<i>( sighs )</i>

13:12.082 --> 13:13.709
He's gonna
wake up Morgan.

13:20.007 --> 13:21.717
Hey, yeah,
what's up?

13:22.968 --> 13:26.055
Yeah, what--
what time tomorrow, though?

13:26.138 --> 13:29.016
Well, I kind of
wanted to be up by
the property by then.

13:30.142 --> 13:33.729
If-- right,
but if you...

13:33.812 --> 13:35.147
( clears throat )

13:35.231 --> 13:37.608
Yeah, okay,
I can swing by there
for a minute, yeah.

13:38.776 --> 13:41.028
All right, 10:00 a.m.

13:41.111 --> 13:43.113
If you wanted to-- oh.

13:53.249 --> 13:55.501
So, how was that
for holding my ground?

13:59.171 --> 14:00.923
( whispers )
Frick.

14:01.006 --> 14:02.925
<i>( keyboard clicking )</i>

14:04.843 --> 14:06.220
<i>( phone chimes )</i>

14:27.992 --> 14:31.579
<i>( Frank sighs )</i>
<i>Okay, so...</i>

14:31.662 --> 14:33.956
<i>last night,</i>
<i>after I dropped you off...</i>

14:35.666 --> 14:37.418
I went back
to the diner...

14:38.919 --> 14:40.921
and I told them the truth
about that night.

14:41.005 --> 14:44.925
I told them that you and I
were not at the movies.

14:45.009 --> 14:46.885
- Joel:<i> Frank, oh, fuck, man.</i>
- Frank:<i> What's it even matter?</i>

14:46.969 --> 14:48.762
-<i> It's, like, four years ago.</i>
-<i> What matters is--</i>

14:48.846 --> 14:51.599
what matters is
I admitted to you that
I shouldn't have done it

14:51.682 --> 14:54.643
and I literally
haven't done anything
even like that again.

14:54.727 --> 14:56.520
<i>Not even close, man!</i>

14:56.604 --> 14:57.896
Okay.

14:59.189 --> 15:01.275
Okay, may I ask why?

15:03.694 --> 15:07.114
I just thought
with everything else
that happened that night,

15:07.197 --> 15:11.827
it's really important that
the truth was out there,
you know?

15:11.910 --> 15:14.705
And it would've
been easy for me
to admit it to Laura!

15:14.788 --> 15:16.624
I wanted to,
I wanted to get it
off my chest,

15:16.707 --> 15:19.335
but you know what,
that would've been
the selfish thing.

15:19.418 --> 15:21.587
Yeah, you're right,
it must've been hard for you

15:21.670 --> 15:23.589
to keep this in
all those years.

15:25.382 --> 15:26.675
Are you serious?

15:28.093 --> 15:30.179
( sighs )
Oh, man.

15:30.262 --> 15:33.015
-<i> ( exhales )</i>
- ( chuckles ) No.

15:33.098 --> 15:35.225
No, man,
it's not on you.

15:35.309 --> 15:36.352
It's on me.

15:37.686 --> 15:39.188
I made the choice,

15:39.271 --> 15:40.856
and-- and I don't know
if it was the right one, but--

15:40.939 --> 15:42.441
to keep it from Laura.

15:43.651 --> 15:45.069
<i>To protect her.</i>

15:46.612 --> 15:49.323
<i>But it's all fine.</i>
<i>Laura will be fine.</i>

15:49.406 --> 15:51.700
- You and me, we're good?
- Oh, yeah.

15:51.784 --> 15:53.744
It's-- I mean,
it's my fuckup.

15:55.579 --> 15:57.706
I'm just-- I'm...
( chuckling )

15:57.790 --> 15:59.291
I'm just glad
we're good.

15:59.375 --> 16:00.918
<i>( chuckles )</i>

16:01.001 --> 16:03.545
- Thanks for coming by.
-<i> Yeah, it's no problem.</i>

16:13.555 --> 16:15.015
<i>( phone chimes )</i>

16:33.826 --> 16:36.370
<i>( chatter )</i>

16:43.460 --> 16:45.754
- ( buzzing )
- Nate: Listen,
I got to, uh...

16:45.838 --> 16:47.339
Alan:
<i>No, we got</i>
<i>to the truth.</i>

16:47.423 --> 16:48.716
<i>The hand</i>
<i>just confirms it.</i>

16:48.799 --> 16:49.967
And when the body
is found,

16:50.050 --> 16:52.386
it'll be even more so.

16:52.469 --> 16:55.305
You can lie to me,
but don't lie to yourself.

16:55.389 --> 16:57.057
<i>What this is</i>
<i>really about, Nate,</i>

16:57.141 --> 16:59.768
<i>is you finally having</i>
<i>a chance to go back</i>

16:59.852 --> 17:02.813
-<i> and rewrite the past.</i>
- That's not true, Alan.

17:02.896 --> 17:04.231
You didn't like
what you perceived to be

17:04.314 --> 17:06.024
the way I took it
away from you.

17:06.108 --> 17:09.069
And now you have someone--
one person, finally--

17:09.153 --> 17:12.740
who stirs up that sense
that you were somehow
wronged by me.

17:12.823 --> 17:15.325
Alan,
it's not about you!

17:16.827 --> 17:18.162
No?

17:19.705 --> 17:22.750
It's about me
trying to do my job.

17:22.833 --> 17:24.877
Your job is about me.

17:26.462 --> 17:28.756
Lest you forget,
when I retired,

17:28.839 --> 17:31.842
there were those
who felt you were
green, remember?

17:33.135 --> 17:34.511
And don't
make me an idiot

17:34.595 --> 17:35.971
for going to bat
for you.

17:36.054 --> 17:37.556
And don't make
yourself an idiot

17:37.639 --> 17:39.308
for going to bat
for the only person

17:39.391 --> 17:40.476
who has
a vested interest

17:40.559 --> 17:42.478
in turning over
the good work of you--

17:42.561 --> 17:45.355
yes, you--
and all your peers.

17:45.439 --> 17:48.358
Now, I need to go.
I got clients.

17:48.442 --> 17:51.028
And not just the O'Connors,
but a bunch of them

17:51.111 --> 17:53.572
who have press literally
climbing their walls,

17:53.655 --> 17:57.910
trying to shiv each other
in the back for any
version of a story.

17:59.787 --> 18:01.163
Are we good?

18:05.834 --> 18:06.960
Sure, Alan.

18:08.462 --> 18:09.838
We're always good.

18:09.922 --> 18:12.299
- ( kids shouting )
-<i> ( Joel sighs )</i>

18:22.392 --> 18:24.520
( sighs )

18:26.105 --> 18:27.981
<i>( whistle trills )</i>

18:47.417 --> 18:49.878
<i>( kids playing )</i>

19:29.459 --> 19:30.919
Okay.

19:31.003 --> 19:35.716
So, two days ago, I see
my old gymnastics coach
at Petco.

19:35.799 --> 19:37.092
Now this.

19:39.011 --> 19:40.304
Joel.

19:41.597 --> 19:43.223
I know.

19:43.307 --> 19:44.892
- Tia.
- I know.

19:46.685 --> 19:49.646
And I assume, you know,
if you remember me,

19:49.730 --> 19:51.273
you also remember
that night.

19:51.356 --> 19:53.942
Yeah, I think that is
fair to assume, yes.

19:57.654 --> 20:00.741
And so, the--
the reason I'm here

20:00.824 --> 20:03.076
is-- well,
out of the blue...

20:04.536 --> 20:05.954
( chuckles )

20:08.081 --> 20:10.626
I'm in a-- I'm in
a really good thing.

20:10.709 --> 20:11.919
I'm married,

20:12.002 --> 20:14.004
-<i> and, um...</i>
- Hmm.

20:14.087 --> 20:15.380
<i>...I don't know</i>
<i>if you know this,</i>

20:15.464 --> 20:17.799
<i>but she and I,</i>
<i>we were--</i>

20:17.883 --> 20:20.135
<i>we were</i>
<i>in a thing then, too.</i>

20:21.929 --> 20:24.097
Is this like
a 12-step thing?

20:24.181 --> 20:25.182
No.

20:26.683 --> 20:28.685
Well...
( chuckles )

20:29.811 --> 20:31.939
No, it's, um--

20:32.022 --> 20:34.107
I was thinking, um...

20:36.026 --> 20:38.862
I don't know
if you're ever gonna
get approached about this...

20:40.614 --> 20:44.284
but if you are and
if you're comfortable
with it,

20:44.368 --> 20:46.286
I was wondering
if you would be okay

20:46.370 --> 20:49.539
with not mentioning that
we actually slept together,

20:49.623 --> 20:51.291
<i>if possible.</i>

20:53.418 --> 20:56.254
I'm sorry,
I-- I don't understand.

20:56.338 --> 20:59.591
Why would this
even come up now?

20:59.675 --> 21:02.094
<i>There are some questions</i>
<i>about that night.</i>

21:02.177 --> 21:06.640
<i>I mean, not that</i>
<i>have anything to do</i>
<i>with... whatever.</i>

21:06.723 --> 21:08.767
<i>It's--</i>
<i>it's a long story.</i>

21:10.227 --> 21:12.354
( sighs )

21:12.437 --> 21:15.232
But things are--
things are really good,

21:15.315 --> 21:19.152
and, man, I've worked
through a lot with my wife.

21:19.236 --> 21:21.571
<i>And if it comes up...</i>

21:21.655 --> 21:23.782
Well, I'm not gonna lie.

21:23.865 --> 21:27.703
Right, look, I'm--
I totally get that.

21:27.786 --> 21:30.122
And that's cool.
I mean-- ( sighs )

21:30.205 --> 21:32.290
Because we didn't
have sex.

21:35.293 --> 21:36.795
Right.

21:36.878 --> 21:38.005
Gotcha.

21:38.088 --> 21:40.173
- No.
-<i> Thank you.</i>

21:40.257 --> 21:44.261
No, no, we actually,
seriously did not have sex.

21:45.387 --> 21:46.888
<i>I'm sorry?</i>

21:46.972 --> 21:48.223
I wanted to.

21:48.307 --> 21:49.891
I'm not saying
I'm proud of that,

21:49.975 --> 21:52.394
but you practically
fell asleep in my car.

21:52.477 --> 21:54.021
I was like,
"This is a six-minute ride

21:54.104 --> 21:56.273
and he already can't keep
his head off the window."

21:56.356 --> 21:58.066
And then once we got
to my place,

21:58.150 --> 22:00.694
all you did was
barf and apologize

22:00.777 --> 22:02.571
and pass out
on my floor.

22:05.032 --> 22:08.118
So, uh--
so we did not have sex?

22:08.201 --> 22:12.497
- We did not have sex.
-<i> Wow, that-- oh, my God.</i>

22:12.581 --> 22:16.418
- Mm.
-<i> That is incredible.</i>

22:16.501 --> 22:19.337
I mean, holy shit,
that is awesome.

22:19.421 --> 22:21.757
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

22:21.840 --> 22:24.760
I mean, it's really me
who should be thanking you,

22:24.843 --> 22:27.512
'cause it's like they say,
sometimes the best cure
for a fantasy

22:27.596 --> 22:28.764
is the fantasy itself.

22:28.847 --> 22:30.557
<i>Oh, really?</i>

22:30.640 --> 22:34.811
<i>I was like,</i>
<i>"Here's this guy</i>
<i>lying in his own throw up."</i>

22:34.895 --> 22:37.230
Yeah, like a polar bear rug
or something.

22:37.314 --> 22:40.942
<i>And I was like,</i>
<i>"Tia, you have created</i>
<i>this reality.</i>

22:41.026 --> 22:44.613
Mark this time--
midnight, new day,
new year, new life."

22:44.696 --> 22:47.616
<i>So, seriously,</i>
<i>thank you.</i>

22:47.699 --> 22:49.409
<i>( school bell ringing )</i>

22:50.994 --> 22:53.955
Well, that was a recess
for the books.

22:54.039 --> 22:57.167
-<i> Yeah.</i>
- You know, congratulations
on your marriage.

22:57.250 --> 22:58.919
- That's a good thing.
-<i> Thanks.</i>

23:00.045 --> 23:01.922
Hey, Tia, sorry.
Um...

23:03.632 --> 23:05.509
<i>What do you mean</i>
<i>by midnight?</i>

23:05.592 --> 23:08.428
That's what time it was
when we got in.

23:08.512 --> 23:11.640
But you said it was
a six-minute car ride

23:11.723 --> 23:14.142
and I-- I passed out
right away.

23:14.226 --> 23:15.227
Yeah.

23:16.561 --> 23:19.856
But you picked me up
at, like, 9:45 or 10:00.

23:19.940 --> 23:23.693
I mean, I actually
remember specifically.

23:23.777 --> 23:25.862
It was--
it was 9:46.

23:27.322 --> 23:29.658
I got you at literally
three minutes to midnight,

23:29.741 --> 23:32.285
'cause as we were driving away,
we heard the people cheering.

23:32.369 --> 23:35.288
And you said we should kiss
'cause it's midnight,

23:35.372 --> 23:37.124
<i>so we pulled over</i>
<i>for a second</i>

23:37.207 --> 23:40.752
<i>and that was when you were</i>
<i>half asleep against the window.</i>

23:40.836 --> 23:42.587
<i>So, we drove on,</i>

23:42.671 --> 23:46.424
<i>then at 12:08,</i>
<i>you were on the floor</i>
<i>of my apartment.</i>

23:46.508 --> 23:48.176
<i>I was like,</i>
<i>"Do I wash his clothes?</i>

23:48.260 --> 23:51.179
That's, like, 24 minutes,
then it's 33 to dry,

23:51.263 --> 23:53.348
which brings me
to just after 1:00 a.m.,

23:53.431 --> 23:55.433
<i>and I have to be</i>
<i>at work at 9:00.</i>

23:55.517 --> 23:58.937
<i>So, yeah,</i>
<i>our entire date lasted</i>

23:59.020 --> 24:00.647
- 11 minutes, which...
-<i> Awesome.</i>

24:00.730 --> 24:03.942
...given its legendary status,
is pretty awesome, right?

24:04.025 --> 24:05.944
- Awesome.
-<i> Yeah.</i>

24:06.027 --> 24:08.155
Well, I really
gotta go, so.

24:08.238 --> 24:09.948
And thank you.

24:10.031 --> 24:11.908
( kids shouting )

24:13.618 --> 24:15.620
No, thank you.

24:15.704 --> 24:17.330
Joel's voice:
<i>9:46.</i>

24:19.583 --> 24:21.376
<i>I know it was 9:46.</i>

24:21.459 --> 24:23.336
<i>I know it was 9:46.</i>

24:23.420 --> 24:26.298
<i>Do you? Do you?</i>
<i>Do you?</i>

24:26.381 --> 24:28.258
<i>Do you know</i>
<i>specifically?</i>

24:28.341 --> 24:29.968
<i>Do you know</i>
<i>specifically?</i>

24:30.051 --> 24:33.513
<i>I know it was 9:46.</i>
<i>Do you know specifically?</i>

24:33.597 --> 24:36.141
- I don't know.
-<i> Why the fuck did you</i>
<i>come back here?</i>

24:36.224 --> 24:37.893
<i>What the fuck</i>
<i>is wrong with you?</i>

24:37.976 --> 24:40.896
-<i> What the fuck is--</i>
-<i> ( phone chiming, buzzing )</i>

24:45.692 --> 24:47.444
<i>( line ringing )</i>

24:47.527 --> 24:48.528
Hey.

24:48.612 --> 24:51.948
Hey.
Where are you?

24:52.032 --> 24:55.076
<i>Uh, someone told me</i>

24:55.160 --> 24:58.079
that Cameron had an uncle
at the ski school thing.

24:58.163 --> 25:00.874
<i>Uh... uh--</i>

25:00.957 --> 25:03.043
<i>uh, I-- you know,</i>
<i>it was early.</i>

25:03.126 --> 25:05.962
<i>I didn't wanna wake you,</i>
<i>so I rented a car.</i>

25:06.046 --> 25:07.422
You could've woken me.

25:07.505 --> 25:09.591
Nah, it's--
it's all good.

25:09.674 --> 25:12.969
The irony is it turned out
to be a false lead anyway, so.

25:13.053 --> 25:16.181
-<i> Mm.</i>
- I'm up there
and heading back soon.

25:16.264 --> 25:18.975
Um, yeah,
well, we're meeting
at the hotel at my room,

25:19.059 --> 25:21.728
so I'll just text you
when we're over there.

25:21.811 --> 25:23.271
<i>Okay.</i>

25:23.355 --> 25:24.564
<i>Sounds good.</i>

25:24.648 --> 25:27.734
<i>Uh, until then,</i>
<i>anything I should do?</i>

25:27.817 --> 25:30.654
<i>Any-- any leads</i>
<i>I should follow?</i>

25:30.737 --> 25:32.405
Just do
what you're doing.

25:32.489 --> 25:35.158
Okay, I can do that.

25:38.161 --> 25:41.373
Hey, I know Frank told you
about the girl

25:41.456 --> 25:42.749
on that night.

25:42.832 --> 25:45.252
<i>Um, I should've</i>
<i>said something.</i>

25:45.335 --> 25:47.087
<i>I was just</i>
<i>fucking horrified</i>

25:47.170 --> 25:49.047
<i>that Nate was gonna</i>
<i>tell Laura,</i>

25:49.130 --> 25:52.342
<i>and I'd feel bad</i>
<i>about that, so...</i>

25:52.425 --> 25:55.428
<i>I'm, uh-- I'm sorry.</i>

25:55.512 --> 25:58.181
<i>It was, uh--</i>
<i>it was a tourist.</i>

25:58.265 --> 26:01.768
Uh, we met at the bar in town
somewhere, as you do.

26:01.851 --> 26:05.563
Um, from, like,
Norway or something.

26:05.647 --> 26:07.148
Which is Helsinki?

26:07.232 --> 26:10.777
- Finland.
-<i> Finland.</i>

26:10.860 --> 26:12.946
<i>It was Finland.</i>
<i>( chuckles )</i>

26:13.029 --> 26:14.906
<i>I remember I was like,</i>

26:14.990 --> 26:17.951
"I don't think
I've ever met somebody
from Finland before.

26:18.034 --> 26:19.619
That's crazy."

26:19.703 --> 26:21.663
<i>Yeah, no worries.</i>

26:21.746 --> 26:25.959
<i>Um, I'll text you in--</i>
<i>when we're over there,</i>
<i>all right?</i>

26:26.042 --> 26:27.502
Yeah, sounds good.

26:29.254 --> 26:31.423
-<i> All right.</i>
- Okay.

26:31.506 --> 26:33.174
Bye.

26:33.258 --> 26:34.884
Nate:
<i>Finland?</i>

26:34.968 --> 26:37.929
<i>Ilsa from Finland?</i>

26:38.013 --> 26:41.141
Petra:
<i>Yep, Ilsa from Finland.</i>

26:42.559 --> 26:43.893
Nate:
<i>I'm trying to figure out</i>

26:43.977 --> 26:46.187
<i>why he would lie</i>
<i>about who he was with.</i>

26:46.271 --> 26:49.190
Petra:
<i>Well, maybe who he was with</i>
<i>will tell us.</i>

26:51.359 --> 26:56.156
So, uh,
where can I read
one of your books?

26:56.239 --> 26:58.700
( chuckles )
Oh, well, that's easy.

26:58.783 --> 27:02.829
Either you go forward in time
to when I actually finish one

27:02.912 --> 27:07.000
or back in time to just before
I completely unravel one
and throw it away.

27:07.083 --> 27:09.669
I will totally
leave that up to you.

27:11.504 --> 27:12.589
You...

27:13.965 --> 27:17.135
you have a very
interesting life.

27:17.218 --> 27:20.430
Yeah, well,
you're probably standing
a little too close to it.

27:22.807 --> 27:26.561
So, is there any part
of your pie chart at all...

27:27.729 --> 27:29.564
that has
another person?

27:31.066 --> 27:32.525
You know what,
Nate?

27:32.609 --> 27:34.527
I think when
it comes down to it,

27:34.611 --> 27:36.988
- I'm just not
a pie person.
- Yeah.

27:37.072 --> 27:40.325
Hey, yo, Teach!

27:40.408 --> 27:42.535
We're here
on official business.

27:42.619 --> 27:44.120
Yeah, I was like,
"I think he knows

27:44.204 --> 27:46.414
we don't literally bring
the kids home with us."

27:46.498 --> 27:50.752
Yeah. Uh,
Miss B. is the boss
of the lending library.

27:50.835 --> 27:52.962
Assistant boss.
Tia.

27:53.046 --> 27:54.422
Petra.

27:54.506 --> 27:56.841
I had a feeling I was
maybe gonna meet you today.

27:56.925 --> 27:58.426
Are you Joel's wife?

27:58.510 --> 28:00.929
Wha-- no, no.
No.

28:01.012 --> 28:04.224
<i>Uh, is it okay</i>
<i>if we talk inside</i>
<i>for a moment?</i>

28:04.307 --> 28:06.768
Well, he was worried
about hurting his wife,

28:06.851 --> 28:10.063
so he wanted to make sure
if I talked to someone,

28:10.146 --> 28:13.691
I didn't tell them
we, you know, whatever,

28:13.775 --> 28:15.193
spent the night
together.

28:16.653 --> 28:18.530
So, he was here?

28:18.613 --> 28:21.616
Literally there
passed out on the floor.

28:21.699 --> 28:22.909
All night?

28:25.662 --> 28:28.123
I'm sorry, so you'll
go on the record

28:28.206 --> 28:30.959
saying that you were
with Joel from 10:00
New Year's Eve

28:31.042 --> 28:37.006
until... whatever,
first thing New Year's Day,

28:37.090 --> 28:40.677
and you saw Joel there
the whole time?

28:40.760 --> 28:43.346
God, he was all hung up
on the 10:00 thing, too.

28:43.430 --> 28:44.556
I told him
it was midnight.

28:44.639 --> 28:47.600
Oh, I'm sorry,
say that again.

28:47.684 --> 28:49.561
<i>I picked him up</i>
<i>at midnight.</i>

28:49.644 --> 28:51.938
<i>11:57, actually.</i>

28:52.021 --> 28:56.568
<i>( Nate clears throat )</i>
<i>Um, official hat here.</i>

28:56.651 --> 29:01.698
<i>Tia, it is very important</i>
<i>that you tell the truth</i>
<i>about this.</i>

29:01.781 --> 29:03.616
( scoffs )
It is the truth.

29:03.700 --> 29:05.785
I bail on the party.
He's in the lot.

29:05.869 --> 29:07.745
I'm like, "You were
my ski instructor."

29:07.829 --> 29:10.039
And he's like,
"Yeah, what are you
doing here?"

29:10.123 --> 29:12.667
So, as we're leaving,
we hear people celebrating,

29:12.750 --> 29:14.794
and he's like,
"It's midnight.
We should kiss."

29:14.878 --> 29:18.006
But when I pull over,
he's practically asleep
against the window.

29:18.089 --> 29:19.507
Six minutes later,
we come in,

29:19.591 --> 29:22.177
he throws up on himself
and passes out at 12:08,

29:22.260 --> 29:23.720
which I know
'cause I was like,

29:23.803 --> 29:25.346
"Do I wash his pants?
Do I not?

29:25.430 --> 29:26.598
It's a 22-minute cycle,

29:26.681 --> 29:28.683
and I have to be
at work at 9:00."

29:30.894 --> 29:33.813
<i>This isn't about</i>
<i>protecting his wife, is it?</i>

29:36.149 --> 29:37.817
Nate:
<i>Am I missing anyone?</i>

29:37.901 --> 29:41.196
Petra:
<i>Oh, you know,</i>
<i>put the previous renters.</i>

29:41.279 --> 29:43.490
- Nate:<i> Bakers?</i>
-<i> Bethels.</i>

29:43.573 --> 29:46.451
- Bethels.
-<i> Tom and Rachel.</i>

29:46.534 --> 29:51.164
And also someone called
Dave and Cynthia Warner.

29:51.247 --> 29:54.667
- E-L-S Bethels?
- Yep.

29:54.751 --> 29:57.587
<i>Here's a question for you.</i>

29:57.670 --> 29:59.839
<i>What is a girl like you</i>

29:59.923 --> 30:02.425
<i>who's smart, pretty,</i>
<i>and funny--</i>

30:02.509 --> 30:04.844
- Nate.
-<i> Tired of the question?</i>

30:04.928 --> 30:08.181
No, he just pulled up.
And, yes, tired of the question.

30:11.309 --> 30:12.810
Okay.

30:12.894 --> 30:18.066
Well, Melissa's decided
to make you her new project.

30:18.149 --> 30:21.694
- She has a list.
- Tell her thanks,
but I'm good.

30:23.071 --> 30:24.364
You tell her.

30:29.911 --> 30:32.622
- Petra:<i> So, what exactly?</i>
-<i> ( water running )</i>

30:32.705 --> 30:35.166
Vehicular pursuit.

30:35.250 --> 30:38.586
February 3rd,
three years ago.

30:38.670 --> 30:41.172
It's a Saturday.

30:41.256 --> 30:45.343
Approximately 4:17 p.m.

30:45.426 --> 30:48.846
It was a--
it was an icy day.

30:48.930 --> 30:51.015
<i>You tired</i>
<i>of that question?</i>

30:52.350 --> 30:53.893
No.

30:53.977 --> 30:56.646
It is what it is.

30:56.729 --> 30:59.357
Started off...

30:59.440 --> 31:01.901
the whole
pain-in-the-butt factor

31:01.985 --> 31:04.821
was far outweighed
by the...

31:04.904 --> 31:09.867
oh-my-God-you're-so-good-
to-her factor.

31:09.951 --> 31:11.578
( chuckles )

31:11.661 --> 31:14.247
Then I was like,
"Okay, I get it.

31:14.330 --> 31:15.957
I'm a freaking saint.

31:16.040 --> 31:18.459
Now, when can we get rid

31:18.543 --> 31:20.795
of the race car bunk bed
in the master bedroom?"

31:20.878 --> 31:22.630
( chuckles )

31:22.714 --> 31:26.467
The answer is never.

31:26.551 --> 31:28.219
I can never...

31:29.429 --> 31:32.307
with my wife, I mean.

31:35.727 --> 31:37.103
The toughest part?

31:38.855 --> 31:43.276
Figuring out which kind of
version of nice I gotta be

31:43.359 --> 31:45.236
to not piss her off.

31:45.320 --> 31:47.030
Thank you.

31:47.113 --> 31:48.948
And that pisses me off.

31:50.825 --> 31:54.329
And then it's, like,
what kind of anger

31:54.412 --> 31:56.956
am I allowed to show?

31:57.040 --> 31:59.125
Because if I don't
show any anger

31:59.208 --> 32:03.087
and-- and then she says
that I'm not being honest.

32:03.171 --> 32:06.215
( shudders )
And I'm not.

32:06.299 --> 32:07.550
Hmm.

32:07.634 --> 32:10.345
-<i> ( elevator dings )</i>
- Nate: Okay.

32:22.023 --> 32:23.775
Nate:
<i>With Horacio,</i>
<i>we're looking</i>

32:23.858 --> 32:27.445
<i>at nothing more</i>
<i>than just a rushed frame-up.</i>

32:27.528 --> 32:29.197
<i>We have two dozen people</i>

32:29.280 --> 32:31.824
<i>placing him at a party</i>
<i>at his own house</i>

32:31.908 --> 32:32.992
for the whole night,

32:33.076 --> 32:36.579
so that leads us
to Michael O'Connor.

32:36.663 --> 32:39.123
He owns the property
up the hill.

32:39.207 --> 32:41.084
Ah!

32:41.167 --> 32:43.378
- Glad you're here.
- Hey, Nate.

32:43.461 --> 32:44.379
Glad you could make it.

32:44.462 --> 32:47.215
Now, this guy Michael

32:47.298 --> 32:48.925
<i>was at the party early</i>
<i>with Olivia.</i>

32:49.008 --> 32:52.011
<i>He was laughing with her,</i>
<i>even arm in arm.</i>

32:52.095 --> 32:54.555
<i>But he leaves</i>
<i>for a dinner at 8:20.</i>

32:54.639 --> 32:56.391
<i>But a witness,</i>
<i>Tom Davis,</i>

32:56.474 --> 32:59.268
<i>puts him back at the house</i>
<i>the time of the murder,</i>

32:59.352 --> 33:02.230
<i>corroborated by the fact</i>
<i>that Olivia called his cell,</i>

33:02.313 --> 33:04.982
<i>which tower pings tells us</i>
<i>was at his house.</i>

33:05.066 --> 33:07.527
<i>The witness,</i>
<i>Tom Davis,</i>

33:07.610 --> 33:09.320
<i>heard Michael's end</i>
<i>of the call.</i>

33:09.404 --> 33:11.531
<i>Olivia was complaining</i>
<i>about the men in her life,</i>

33:11.614 --> 33:13.700
<i>the same as the call</i>
<i>that she made to JC,</i>

33:13.783 --> 33:16.661
her friend,
immediately afterwards.

33:16.744 --> 33:19.455
Mr. O'Connor
then leaves the next day
for Turks and Caicos.

33:19.539 --> 33:22.709
- Joel:
<i>And that's not suspicious?</i>
- Is what suspicious?

33:22.792 --> 33:25.086
He just takes off
to Turks and Caicos?

33:25.169 --> 33:26.671
<i>Oh, no, no,</i>
<i>no, no, no, no.</i>

33:26.754 --> 33:28.756
<i>This guy takes the same trip</i>
<i>every year for 11 years--</i>

33:28.840 --> 33:31.217
<i>same day, same flight.</i>

33:31.300 --> 33:33.136
<i>No, not a suspect.</i>

33:33.219 --> 33:35.430
<i>However,</i>
<i>I know this is touchy,</i>

33:35.513 --> 33:38.516
<i>but we can't--</i>
<i>we can't rule out Eric.</i>

33:40.518 --> 33:44.105
<i>On his hammer</i>
<i>was found her blood,</i>
<i>his prints.</i>

33:44.188 --> 33:45.898
He was redoing her studio.

33:45.982 --> 33:48.776
<i>( hammering )</i>

33:48.860 --> 33:50.194
What are you doing?

33:50.278 --> 33:52.697
Oh, Liv didn't tell you?

33:52.780 --> 33:54.699
This is gonna be
an office now.

33:59.162 --> 34:01.080
Nate:
<i>It was found in his bag.</i>

34:01.164 --> 34:03.416
Petra:
<i>Who puts a murder weapon</i>
<i>in their own bag?</i>

34:03.499 --> 34:05.084
Nate:
<i>Someone in</i>
<i>a rush to leave?</i>

34:05.168 --> 34:07.670
Petra:
<i>Or someone</i>
<i>who's being framed?</i>

34:07.754 --> 34:09.922
<i>Nate, you said</i>
<i>in your own case notes</i>

34:10.006 --> 34:12.049
"Why is Alan
fixated on Eric?"

34:12.133 --> 34:14.510
You didn't-- you didn't
think the case should
close when it did.

34:14.594 --> 34:15.845
Nate:
<i>But we're</i>
<i>getting off track.</i>

34:15.928 --> 34:17.889
<i>Uh, so, we have Eric.</i>

34:17.972 --> 34:19.807
That leads us
to Cameron.

34:19.891 --> 34:23.519
Cameron motive--
the safe?

34:23.603 --> 34:24.937
Probably.

34:25.021 --> 34:26.189
So, check.

34:27.940 --> 34:30.443
<i>Means-- no idea.</i>

34:30.526 --> 34:32.653
<i>Opportunity--</i>
<i>no idea.</i>

34:32.737 --> 34:34.781
<i>Behavior?</i>

34:34.864 --> 34:36.783
<i>Well, he dropped</i>
<i>off the face of the Earth.</i>

34:36.866 --> 34:40.661
Oh, good work
with the maid's niece.

34:40.745 --> 34:45.416
There was a water bill
that had a forwarding address...

34:45.500 --> 34:48.002
in Langer Plain.

34:48.085 --> 34:51.964
There's a name--
Leticia Aguilar or Letty.

34:52.048 --> 34:54.634
I'm still waiting
to get approval to go in.

34:56.677 --> 34:59.347
- Hey, we'll go.
- No, no, no, I still
need more time.

34:59.430 --> 35:01.432
No, we'll be fine.
We can go right now.

35:01.516 --> 35:03.100
We're not done here.

35:03.184 --> 35:04.852
You were also
on the property.

35:04.936 --> 35:08.105
Well, I worked there
and I lived there,

35:08.189 --> 35:10.942
so of course
I was there.

35:11.025 --> 35:13.736
<i>No, I meant</i>
<i>you were there.</i>

35:13.820 --> 35:15.488
<i>So, did you see</i>
<i>anybody?</i>

35:15.571 --> 35:18.991
<i>Or do you know</i>
<i>anybody who could be</i>
<i>a possible suspect?</i>

35:19.075 --> 35:21.160
<i>When you left</i>
<i>at 9:46,</i>

35:21.244 --> 35:23.538
<i>did you see anyone</i>
<i>on your way out?</i>

35:23.621 --> 35:24.831
We've got a list.

35:24.914 --> 35:26.499
We're just trying
to figure out

35:26.582 --> 35:28.835
if there was anybody
who owed her money

35:28.918 --> 35:31.879
or had beefs
or anything.

35:31.963 --> 35:34.340
Well, I'll put
some thought into it.

35:34.423 --> 35:36.592
She pissed
a lot of people off, so.

35:37.677 --> 35:39.053
Can we talk about Ilsa?

35:39.136 --> 35:42.265
Or whatever
her name is.
Sure.

35:42.348 --> 35:44.517
<i>So, uh,</i>

35:44.600 --> 35:47.478
<i>there's no easy way</i>
<i>to say this,</i>

35:47.562 --> 35:49.021
<i>so I just will.</i>

35:51.607 --> 35:54.694
<i>I'm in</i>
<i>a weird place here.</i>

35:54.777 --> 35:56.696
<i>Frank told me</i>
<i>about your concerns,</i>

35:56.779 --> 36:00.867
<i>and, um, I'm not gonna</i>
<i>say anything to Laura.</i>

36:00.950 --> 36:04.745
<i>I believe that's between</i>
<i>you two to, um--</i>

36:04.829 --> 36:06.873
<i>whatever,</i>
<i>to work out.</i>

36:09.542 --> 36:11.878
But there's nothing else,
though, is there?

36:13.004 --> 36:14.005
Nothing else what?

36:15.339 --> 36:17.133
<i>That I need</i>
<i>to know about, Joel.</i>

36:22.597 --> 36:23.472
No.

36:25.850 --> 36:27.310
<i>( sighs )</i>

36:27.393 --> 36:30.605
<i>Okay.</i>
<i>Okay, cool.</i>

36:30.688 --> 36:33.900
- You sure?
- ( chuckles ) Yeah.

36:33.983 --> 36:36.485
( chuckles )
Okay.

36:36.569 --> 36:38.738
Okay,
to Leticia's.

36:38.821 --> 36:39.947
Great.

36:42.199 --> 36:43.451
<i>( phone chimes )</i>

36:47.288 --> 36:48.581
<i>( phone chimes )</i>

36:50.374 --> 36:51.751
<i>( phone chimes )</i>

36:55.880 --> 36:57.506
<i>( phone chimes )</i>

36:57.590 --> 37:01.010
Oh, hey, Nate wanted me
to ask you a question.

37:02.303 --> 37:04.388
<i>JC said you owed her.</i>

37:06.891 --> 37:08.935
I don't follow.

37:09.018 --> 37:10.978
<i>Well, we were</i>
<i>talking about</i>

37:11.062 --> 37:13.105
<i>people who owed her money</i>
<i>back at the hotel,</i>

37:13.189 --> 37:15.983
<i>and I just remembered</i>
<i>that JC said that--</i>

37:16.067 --> 37:18.903
Look, tons owed her.
In my case, it was murky.

37:18.986 --> 37:20.613
I mean, when I first
started there,
she was like,

37:20.696 --> 37:22.448
"Hey, you can work
instead of rent."

37:22.531 --> 37:24.659
And then all of a sudden,
she's like, "You owe me
for 10 months."

37:24.742 --> 37:26.118
And I was like, "What?"

37:26.202 --> 37:27.787
But I wouldn't
say I owed.

37:29.956 --> 37:31.707
Oh, you're gonna
turn up here.

37:48.432 --> 37:50.184
( engine turns off )

37:50.268 --> 37:53.270
So, what are you saying?
This is written down
somewhere?

37:53.354 --> 37:56.190
Well, what was written down
is that she was gonna go
into the new year--

37:56.273 --> 37:59.443
she and Eric both-- clean,
without owing or being owed.

37:59.527 --> 38:03.364
<i>And JC said</i>
<i>he found this out</i>
<i>right before Christmas, so.</i>

38:03.447 --> 38:05.992
Anyway, I wouldn't--
I wouldn't worry too much
about it.

38:06.075 --> 38:08.244
Wait.

38:08.327 --> 38:09.412
When?

38:10.746 --> 38:12.331
I just told you,
before Christmas.

38:12.415 --> 38:14.750
<i>No, when did</i>
<i>you hear this?</i>

38:14.834 --> 38:17.253
Various times
over the last week.

38:28.055 --> 38:29.682
Joel:
<i>You and Nate</i>
<i>spoke about this,</i>

38:29.765 --> 38:31.517
<i>and you and JC</i>
<i>spoke about this?</i>

38:31.600 --> 38:33.227
- ( phone chimes )
-<i> I thought you said</i>

38:33.310 --> 38:35.730
<i>you could not get anybody</i>
<i>to talk to you out here?</i>

38:35.813 --> 38:38.607
I said no one<i> wanted</i>
to talk to me.

38:38.691 --> 38:42.111
( phone chiming )

38:45.573 --> 38:46.449
( phone chimes )

38:56.459 --> 38:59.086
- Leticia?
- You're Joel?

38:59.170 --> 39:00.337
<i>Hi, I'm Petra.</i>

39:00.421 --> 39:03.632
- You got a minute?
- Yeah.

39:03.716 --> 39:06.302
Cameron would
constantly blab about
the safe in the lady's studio

39:06.385 --> 39:08.346
and how it was always
keeping cash.

39:08.429 --> 39:10.806
And then he said
there were some art drawings

39:10.890 --> 39:13.476
for her charity,
and he had did research,

39:13.559 --> 39:15.728
- and they were worth $75,000.
-<i> ( phone chimes )</i>

39:15.811 --> 39:18.064
So, then he figured out
the combination to the safe

39:18.147 --> 39:19.565
- and--
- Wait, I'm sorry.

39:19.648 --> 39:22.151
He just figures out
the combination?

39:22.234 --> 39:24.403
In the Sylvester Stallone
movie "Escape Plan,"

39:24.487 --> 39:26.197
they tell which safe numbers
are used the most

39:26.280 --> 39:28.157
- by how dark the keys are.
- ( phone chimes )

39:28.240 --> 39:30.076
And so, he goes
to the studio

39:30.159 --> 39:32.745
and he was like, "Okay,
5 is darkest by a lot,

39:32.828 --> 39:35.081
and then the 7
and the 8."

39:35.164 --> 39:37.458
And so, then he Googles
a whole bunch of stuff,

39:37.541 --> 39:39.043
including her birthday,

39:39.126 --> 39:41.879
which turns out to be
May 7, 1958.

39:41.962 --> 39:43.255
5-7-5-8.

39:43.339 --> 39:45.841
- So then he broke in?
- I don't know.

39:45.925 --> 39:49.595
<i>'Cause then he was gone.</i>
<i>Christmas Eve.</i>

39:49.678 --> 39:52.348
<i>My Aunt Flor was like,</i>
<i>"I told you about him."</i>

39:52.431 --> 39:54.100
Joel:
<i>How did she know him?</i>

39:54.183 --> 39:57.812
I don't know.
They were busybodies,
my aunt and her friends.

39:57.895 --> 40:01.190
She worked for the rich people,
so she thought she was
so important.

40:01.273 --> 40:02.942
Then she left
and she was suddenly

40:03.025 --> 40:05.694
just an old Mexican lady
in Mexico again.

40:05.778 --> 40:09.240
( scoffs )
That's another one
I don't need to bother with.

40:09.323 --> 40:11.075
When did she leave?

40:11.158 --> 40:13.160
Somewhere around
New Year's.

40:13.244 --> 40:16.247
We weren't close.
I wasn't keeping track.

40:16.330 --> 40:18.624
You know
how to reach her?

40:18.707 --> 40:19.875
No.

40:19.959 --> 40:22.670
Anyway, she got married,
moved out of Mexico.

40:22.753 --> 40:24.964
I have no idea what
her last name is now

40:25.047 --> 40:26.841
or what country
she's even in.

40:28.592 --> 40:30.719
Leticia:
<i>What is it that you keep</i>
<i>looking at in there?</i>

40:30.803 --> 40:33.097
Petra:
<i>Is that painting--</i>
<i>by the window,</i>

40:33.180 --> 40:35.266
<i>is that a Xavier Martinez?</i>

40:35.349 --> 40:36.809
Leticia:
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>My uncle had it.</i>

40:38.144 --> 40:39.603
You should
have it looked at.

40:39.687 --> 40:41.313
<i>Why? It's ugly.</i>

40:42.398 --> 40:44.859
How much would you
sell it for?

40:44.942 --> 40:46.944
( sighs )
A hundred dollars?

40:47.027 --> 40:48.571
( laughs )

40:48.654 --> 40:50.114
You should
have it looked at.

40:52.158 --> 40:53.576
Let's go.

40:53.659 --> 40:54.910
Thank you.

41:10.843 --> 41:13.554
Joel:
<i>So, clearly, Cameron</i>
<i>tried to break into the safe.</i>

41:13.637 --> 41:15.598
That's why he cut
the security footage,

41:15.681 --> 41:18.350
and that's probably
why I saw him there
the month before that.

41:18.434 --> 41:21.812
The plan?
Steal it on New Year's
when everyone's distracted.

41:21.896 --> 41:24.190
But she--
she surprises him.

41:24.273 --> 41:26.859
She goes back to the studio
and catches him in the act.

41:26.942 --> 41:28.652
We know that the safe
was banged up.

41:28.736 --> 41:30.487
We know that the money
and the drawings were gone.

41:30.571 --> 41:32.072
I'm-- I'm sorry.

41:32.156 --> 41:34.658
Is it rude of me to ask
why you keep changing
your sunglasses?

41:34.742 --> 41:36.243
Is it a looks thing?

41:36.327 --> 41:37.745
Well, not<i> my</i> looks.

41:37.828 --> 41:39.205
But I like to have
at least some control

41:39.288 --> 41:40.581
over the way things
look around me.

41:40.664 --> 41:42.541
( sighs )

41:42.625 --> 41:45.711
Anyways,
I'm checking with a bunch
of kids' book art dealers,

41:45.794 --> 41:47.588
emailing a bunch
to see if anybody's

41:47.671 --> 41:50.591
ever tried to fence
one of her drawings.

41:50.674 --> 41:52.259
It won't prove anything.

41:52.343 --> 41:54.803
Are you kidding me?
It will prove he
stole them.

41:54.887 --> 41:56.305
We already know
he stole them.

41:56.388 --> 41:58.432
But he was gone
on Christmas.

41:58.515 --> 42:00.684
He left Leticia
on Christmas.

42:00.768 --> 42:02.436
Maybe even made a big show
of doing it, too--

42:02.519 --> 42:04.897
her, the landlord--
so people would think
he was out of town.

42:04.980 --> 42:08.234
Then he just sneaks
back in on New Year's.

42:08.317 --> 42:10.027
The safe had already
been robbed,

42:10.110 --> 42:12.154
which was why it was
empty when the murder
was discovered.

42:12.238 --> 42:14.114
You don't know that.
It could have been
robbed that night.

42:14.198 --> 42:17.326
Why would you break into
a safe you already had
the combination to?

42:28.921 --> 42:30.464
<i>( phone chimes )</i>

42:30.547 --> 42:33.259
<i>( helicopter approaching )</i>

42:37.137 --> 42:39.014
They found a body.

42:39.098 --> 42:41.350
<i>( helicopter whirring )</i>

42:46.146 --> 42:49.984
<i>( chatter )</i>

42:50.067 --> 42:51.819
( camera shutter clicking )

42:55.698 --> 42:57.658
Nope. No.

42:59.034 --> 43:01.203
You cannot
be here, Alan.

43:01.287 --> 43:02.329
Is that her?

43:02.413 --> 43:04.164
Alan, what are you
doing here?

43:04.248 --> 43:07.668
Tom Davis, he runs--
represents the owners
of the property.

43:07.751 --> 43:10.921
I'm aware of who he is,
but right now, this property
is under my jurisdiction.

43:11.005 --> 43:13.507
- We're not going
to get in anybody's way--
- You already are in the way.

43:13.590 --> 43:14.842
Don't you talk to me
that way!

43:14.925 --> 43:16.677
I'm not doing this now.
Dave?

43:16.760 --> 43:18.512
- Tom: Alan, it's all right.
- It's time to go, Mr. Pape.

43:18.596 --> 43:19.972
- Get your hands off me.
- Mr. Pape, it's time to go.

43:20.055 --> 43:23.225
- Tom: Alan...
- Oh, good. No. Nope.

43:23.309 --> 43:24.560
Trust me,

43:24.643 --> 43:26.687
you guys do not want
to be the technicality

43:26.770 --> 43:28.522
that gets this case
shut down again.

43:28.605 --> 43:30.482
Joel:
"Down again"?
You mean it's open?

43:30.566 --> 43:32.651
Nate: Unofficially.
I'm trying to get it
reopened.

43:32.735 --> 43:34.153
And in light
of the new circumstances,

43:34.236 --> 43:35.654
I think I got
a pretty good shot.

43:35.738 --> 43:37.031
Well, that's--
that's great.

43:37.114 --> 43:38.449
Nate:
Yeah, as long
as nobody screws it up

43:38.532 --> 43:40.909
and I get to do the job
the way I need to do it.

43:40.993 --> 43:42.494
Is that why
Alan was so angry?

43:42.578 --> 43:43.954
It's complicated.

43:44.038 --> 43:46.040
Alan is mad because
he's not boss anymore

43:46.123 --> 43:48.625
and because he's trying
to get information that
I can't give him,

43:48.709 --> 43:50.294
- or to anyone!
- Anyone?

43:50.377 --> 43:52.254
Nate:
Yeah, anyone,
meaning specifically

43:52.338 --> 43:54.381
people who are not
involved in this case.

43:54.465 --> 43:56.300
I need you guys
off the property now.

43:56.383 --> 43:58.177
- Reporter:<i> Detective,</i>
<i>a statement, please.</i>
- Joel, please.

43:58.260 --> 44:00.304
Hey! Especially you.

44:00.387 --> 44:02.306
Look, I'm sorry,
but things are
different now.

44:02.389 --> 44:04.391
I-- I can't
communicate with you.

44:04.475 --> 44:07.311
- Are you serious?
- I need you off
the property now.

44:07.394 --> 44:09.313
Reporter:
Is it Olivia Lake?

44:09.396 --> 44:11.106
Would you secure this,
please?

44:11.190 --> 44:12.733
Reporter:
Can you please give us
some more information?

44:12.816 --> 44:14.526
Nate:
No comment.
Come on, Dave, John.

44:14.610 --> 44:18.113
No comment!
Please, no comment.

44:18.197 --> 44:21.033
Um... excuse me, Petra.

44:21.116 --> 44:22.743
I...

44:22.826 --> 44:25.871
think I need to take
a walk or something.

44:25.954 --> 44:28.040
Oh, sure, sure.
Of course.

44:28.123 --> 44:29.875
I gotta--

44:29.958 --> 44:32.002
I gotta think about
some stuff, too.
