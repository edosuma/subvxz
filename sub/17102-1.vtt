01:27.464 --> 01:28.945
<i>My name is Jane Eyre...</i>

01:28.947 --> 01:32.980
<i>I was born in 1820, a harsh
time of change in England.</i>

01:33.108 --> 01:35.062
<i>Money and position seemed
all that mattered.</i>

01:35.342 --> 01:38.313
<i>Charity was a cold
and disagreeable word.</i>

01:38.466 --> 01:42.078
<i>Religion too often wore a
mask of bigotry and cruelty.</i>

01:42.286 --> 01:45.420
<i>There was no proper place for
the poor of the unfortunate.</i>

01:45.455 --> 01:48.354
<i>I had no father or mother,
brother or sister.</i>

01:48.440 --> 01:52.009
<i>As a child I lived with my aunt,
Mrs Reed of Gateshead Hall.</i>

01:52.078 --> 01:55.781
<i>I do not remember that she ever
spoke one kind word to me.</i>

02:08.127 --> 02:11.098
Careful, Bessie. She bites.

02:19.723 --> 02:22.146
Come on out, Jane Eyre.

02:24.102 --> 02:26.651
Mrs. Reed wants to see
you in the drawing room.

02:33.153 --> 02:35.201
- Go on, knock. Knock.
- Don't bully the child.

02:37.574 --> 02:39.417
Come in.

02:43.664 --> 02:46.759
This, Mr. Brocklehurst,
is the child in question.

02:46.917 --> 02:49.420
She's the daughter of my
late husband's sister.

02:49.586 --> 02:53.591
By an unfortunate union, which we
in the family prefer to forget.

02:53.757 --> 02:56.180
For some years she's
lived in this house.

02:56.343 --> 02:59.313
The recipient, I can clearly
see, of every care...

02:59.471 --> 03:02.190
which her loving benefactress
could lavish upon her.

03:03.433 --> 03:05.777
Come here, little girl.

03:07.938 --> 03:10.737
- What is your name?
- Jane Eyre, sir.

03:10.899 --> 03:13.243
Well, Jane Eyre, and
are you a good child?

03:13.402 --> 03:16.406
- The less said on that subject the better.
- Indeed.

03:16.571 --> 03:19.791
Only this morning she struck
her little cousin most brutally...

03:19.950 --> 03:21.452
and without provocation.

03:21.618 --> 03:24.462
- That isn't true! He hit me first.
- Jane. Silence!

03:26.790 --> 03:30.420
- John, dear, did you strike her first?
- No indeed, Mama.

03:30.585 --> 03:33.805
You did. You knocked me down and
hit my head and made it bleed!

03:33.964 --> 03:35.011
- I did not!
- You did!

03:35.173 --> 03:37.050
- Silence!
- You did! You did!

03:38.260 --> 03:40.479
I won't listen to your odious lies.

03:40.637 --> 03:43.982
You see, Mr. Brocklehurst, how
passionate and wicked she is.

03:44.141 --> 03:45.984
I do indeed.

03:46.143 --> 03:47.315
Come here, child.

03:49.104 --> 03:51.232
You and I must have some talk.

03:53.650 --> 03:56.494
No sight so sad as that
of a wicked child.

03:56.653 --> 03:58.655
Do you know where the
wicked go after death?

03:58.822 --> 03:59.994
They go to hell.

04:00.157 --> 04:02.034
- And what is hell?
- A pit full of fire.

04:02.200 --> 04:05.420
And should you like to fall into that
pit and be burning there forever?

04:05.579 --> 04:07.707
- No, sir.
- Then what must you do to avoid it?

04:07.873 --> 04:10.217
I must keep in good
health and not die.

04:13.587 --> 04:16.261
But children younger
than you die daily.

04:16.423 --> 04:20.519
Only last week we buried
a little child of 5.

04:21.636 --> 04:25.607
A good little child whose
soul is now in heaven.

04:25.766 --> 04:27.018
But what of your soul?

04:27.184 --> 04:29.278
I don't see why it shouldn't
go to heaven too.

04:29.436 --> 04:30.608
You don't see.

04:30.771 --> 04:33.115
But others see clearly
enough, do they not?

04:35.358 --> 04:38.453
- You have heard the name of Lowood?
- No, sir.

04:38.612 --> 04:42.082
It is a school for
unfortunate orphans.

04:42.240 --> 04:43.742
My estate lies within a mile...

04:43.909 --> 04:47.083
and as chairman of the board,
I spend much time in its supervision.

04:47.287 --> 04:49.540
Would you like to go
there, little girl?

04:49.706 --> 04:52.880
You mean not live here anymore?

04:53.460 --> 04:55.462
I don't know what
Aunt Reed would say.

04:55.629 --> 04:58.553
It was your kind benefactress
who suggested the plan.

04:58.715 --> 05:01.309
- Do you wish to go?
- Yes, sir.

05:01.468 --> 05:04.517
You've made a wise choice.
Wiser than you know.

05:04.721 --> 05:07.565
And now you must pray God to
take away your heart of stone...

05:08.141 --> 05:11.111
and make you meek and
humble and penitent.

05:11.269 --> 05:13.271
And you may rest
assured, Mrs. Reed...

05:13.438 --> 05:16.908
we shall do our best to
collaborate with the Almighty.

05:22.906 --> 05:24.579
- Bessie.
- Yes, Jane?

05:24.741 --> 05:27.995
I never dreamt I'd get away from
here till I was quite grown up.

05:28.161 --> 05:30.601
Won't you even be sorry to
leave your poor old Bessie?

05:30.747 --> 05:35.423
What does Bessie care for me?
She's always scolding and punishing.

05:36.711 --> 05:40.056
All the same, I am rather
sorry to be leaving you.

05:40.215 --> 05:42.559
"Rather sorry." Is that all?

05:42.717 --> 05:46.312
And I suppose if I asked you to give me
a kiss, you'd say you would rather not.

05:46.513 --> 05:48.515
I'll kiss you, and welcome, Bessie.

05:51.643 --> 05:54.738
You're such a strange,
solitary little thing.

05:55.313 --> 05:58.157
Here's a keepsake, Jane.
It'll help you remember me.

05:58.316 --> 06:00.239
Come on, hurry up.

06:00.443 --> 06:02.366
Be a good girl. And I
hope you'll be happy.

06:02.529 --> 06:05.328
Thank you, Bessie. Goodbye.

06:07.325 --> 06:09.293
Goodbye, Jane.

06:18.503 --> 06:21.131
Goodbye, Mrs. Reed! I hate you
and everything about you!

06:21.298 --> 06:25.098
I'll never come and see you again! I'll
never call you "aunt" as long as I live!

06:25.260 --> 06:27.262
And if anyone asks me
how you treated me...

06:27.429 --> 06:29.648
I'll say you are bad and
hardhearted and mean.

06:29.806 --> 06:32.650
And the very sight of
you makes me sick!

06:42.485 --> 06:45.204
At school I shall have drawing
lessons and French lessons...

06:45.363 --> 06:47.036
and history and music lessons.

06:47.198 --> 06:49.667
And there'll be hundreds
of other girls to play with.

06:49.826 --> 06:52.170
And, uh, what's the name
of this school of yours?

06:52.329 --> 06:55.879
- It's called Lowood.
- Lowood?

06:56.666 --> 06:57.713
Lowood.

07:26.321 --> 07:30.827
Here you are. She's
been asleep for hours.

07:36.247 --> 07:37.294
Right away, Bill.

07:46.554 --> 07:50.398
<i>I was to awaken in the morning to
find my dreams of Lowood shattered.</i>

07:50.618 --> 07:54.011
<i>In their place was to stand a school
that was more like a prison,</i>

07:54.046 --> 07:57.824
<i>Dominated by the cold, implacable
cruelty of Mr. Brocklehurst.</i>

08:31.428 --> 08:33.395
Pupils.

08:33.679 --> 08:35.727
Observe this child.

08:36.140 --> 08:40.486
She is yet young. She possesses
the ordinary form of girlhood.

08:40.645 --> 08:44.070
No single deformity points her
out as a marked character.

08:44.274 --> 08:49.576
Who would believe that the evil one
had already found in her a servant...

08:49.738 --> 08:51.536
and an agent?

08:51.698 --> 08:55.544
Yet such, I grieve to
tell you, is the case.

08:56.119 --> 08:59.919
Therefore, you must be on
your guard against her.

09:00.081 --> 09:06.009
Shun her example, avoid her company,
exclude her from your sports...

09:06.171 --> 09:08.549
and shut her out
from your converse.

09:08.715 --> 09:12.515
Teachers! You must watch her.

09:13.011 --> 09:16.390
Weigh well her words and
scrutinize her actions.

09:16.556 --> 09:20.106
Punish her body to save her soul.

09:20.268 --> 09:24.648
For it is my duty to warn you, and
my tongue falters as I tell it...

09:24.814 --> 09:28.444
that this girl, this child, the
native of a Christian land...

09:28.610 --> 09:31.739
no better than many a little
heathen that says its prayers...

09:31.905 --> 09:36.331
to Brahma and kneels
before Juggernaut.

09:36.701 --> 09:40.001
This girl is a liar!

09:42.290 --> 09:46.011
Let her remain on that stool. Let no one
speak to her for the rest of the day.

10:53.278 --> 10:56.452
I brought you this from supper.

10:56.614 --> 10:59.367
Didn't you hear what he said?

10:59.534 --> 11:03.289
He said you mustn't have
anything to do with me.

11:04.956 --> 11:07.835
Go on, take it.

11:10.253 --> 11:14.554
I'm not bad. I promise I'm not.

11:14.924 --> 11:17.723
- But I hate him. I hate him!
- It's wrong to hate people.

11:17.886 --> 11:20.014
I can't help it.

11:21.181 --> 11:24.651
I thought school would be a place
where people would love me.

11:24.809 --> 11:30.031
I want people to love me and
believe in me and be kind to me.

11:30.481 --> 11:34.406
I'd let my arm be broken if
it would make anyone love me.

11:34.569 --> 11:37.698
Or let a horse kick me.
Or be tossed by a bull.

11:37.864 --> 11:41.789
- Don't say such things.
- But I would. I would!

11:45.663 --> 11:47.415
Eat your bread, Jane.

12:06.017 --> 12:09.567
O merciful Providence, who,
of thy generous plenty...

12:09.729 --> 12:13.450
doth give us the abundant fruits
of the field for our sustenance...

12:13.608 --> 12:16.612
grant us that though we are
duly and properly grateful...

12:16.778 --> 12:21.033
for this our earthly food, yet our
hearts may be more lastingly fixed...

12:21.199 --> 12:23.748
upon thy heavenly manner. Amen.

12:27.205 --> 12:29.424
Helen, where does that road go?

12:29.582 --> 12:31.584
I told you before. To Bradford.

12:31.751 --> 12:33.128
But after Bradford?

12:33.294 --> 12:35.888
Derby, I suppose. And
Nottingham and then London.

12:36.339 --> 12:39.388
From London to Dover and
across the sea to France...

12:39.550 --> 12:42.269
and then over the mountains
and down to Italy...

12:42.428 --> 12:44.806
and to Florence and
Rome and Madrid...

12:44.973 --> 12:46.691
Madrid isn't in Italy, Jane.

12:46.891 --> 12:49.019
That road goes there all the same.

12:49.185 --> 12:52.530
And we'll drive along it one day
when we're grown up, Helen...

12:52.689 --> 12:54.532
in a lovely coach and four.

12:54.691 --> 12:56.693
And I'll have beautiful
curly hair just like yours.

12:58.278 --> 13:00.372
And I'll have read all the
books in the world...

13:00.530 --> 13:04.330
and I'll play the piano and talk
French almost as well as you do.

13:04.701 --> 13:07.545
- Dreaming again, Jane?
- Oh, Dr. Rivers.

13:07.745 --> 13:09.543
Somebody's gonna be
late for inspection.

13:09.747 --> 13:12.091
Not this time. I'll beat you there.

13:24.470 --> 13:26.347
- Aah.
- Aah.

13:26.514 --> 13:29.484
- Aah.
- Aah.

13:31.311 --> 13:32.654
Aah.

13:32.812 --> 13:34.780
That cough doesn't seem
any better, Helen.

13:34.939 --> 13:36.737
We'll have to take care of it.

13:36.899 --> 13:38.822
- Aah.
- Aah.

13:38.985 --> 13:41.454
- Aah.
- Aah.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.284
Thank you.

13:46.451 --> 13:49.170
You keep your schoolroom
uncommonly cold, Mr. Brocklehurst.

13:49.329 --> 13:51.206
A matter of principle, Dr. Rivers.

13:51.372 --> 13:54.216
Our aim is not to pamper the body,
but to strengthen the soul.

13:54.375 --> 13:57.879
I should hardly have thought that a
bad cough was any aid to salvation.

13:58.046 --> 14:02.301
Then, I'm not a theologian.
Good day, sir.

14:13.770 --> 14:15.317
If I may venture an opinion...

14:15.480 --> 14:18.279
When I want your opinion,
madam, I shall call for it.

14:19.609 --> 14:23.204
Johnson, you poke your chin
most unpleasantly. Draw it in.

14:29.660 --> 14:32.413
Edwards, I insist on your
holding your head up.

14:32.580 --> 14:35.709
I will not have you stand
before me in that attitude.

14:41.422 --> 14:45.177
Miss Scatcherd! Fetch me
the scissors immediately.

14:45.385 --> 14:47.763
What, may I ask, is
the meaning of this?

14:47.929 --> 14:51.183
Why, in defiance of every precept and
principle of this establishment...

14:51.349 --> 14:53.818
is this young person permitted
to wear her hair in curls?

14:53.976 --> 14:55.319
Her hair curls naturally.

14:55.478 --> 14:57.572
Miss Scatcherd, how often
must I tell you...

14:57.730 --> 14:59.903
we are not here to
conform to nature?

15:00.066 --> 15:03.070
I want these girls to
be children of grace.

15:10.660 --> 15:12.253
Please, please, sir, don't do that.

15:12.412 --> 15:14.335
You can cut mine as much
as you wish, but...

15:14.497 --> 15:15.840
Silence!

15:16.249 --> 15:18.343
So this is the spirit
that prevails at Lowood.

15:18.501 --> 15:21.630
First vanity, and now insurrection.

15:22.463 --> 15:24.261
It shall be rooted out.

15:53.035 --> 15:54.662
Dr. Rivers.

15:54.829 --> 15:58.208
I brought this oil for Helen.
I want her chest rubbed with it.

15:58.374 --> 15:59.574
Helen, doctor?

15:59.709 --> 16:02.383
Yes, I'm concerned about her lungs.
I've spoken to Mr. Bro...

16:04.422 --> 16:07.642
- What are they doing out in the rain?
- It was Mr. Brocklehurst's order.

16:07.800 --> 16:08.972
Bring them in.

16:09.135 --> 16:13.140
- What shall I say to Mr. Brocklehurst?
- You will refer Mr. Brocklehurst to me.

16:19.645 --> 16:23.240
With your leave, Dr. Rivers,
I shall offer up one more prayer.

16:23.399 --> 16:27.825
Almighty God, look down upon
this miserable sinner...

16:28.154 --> 16:30.407
and grant that the sense
of her weakness...

16:30.573 --> 16:35.750
may give strength to her faith and
seriousness to her repentance.

16:35.912 --> 16:37.459
Amen.

16:45.338 --> 16:47.636
The ways of Providence are
inscrutable, Dr. Rivers.

16:47.798 --> 16:50.096
Was it Providence that sent
that poor girl in the rain?

16:50.259 --> 16:52.139
Was it Providence that
ordered her to her death?

16:53.471 --> 16:55.849
Yes, to her death,
Mr. Brocklehurst.

17:06.858 --> 17:08.656
Helen.

17:09.069 --> 17:10.913
Helen.

17:11.155 --> 17:15.204
Oh, I'm so glad. I heard
Dr. Rivers say...

17:15.785 --> 17:19.790
- I was afraid.
- I'm not afraid, Jane.

17:20.540 --> 17:22.338
Helen.

17:22.500 --> 17:23.843
Helen.

17:24.335 --> 17:29.262
You must be cold. Lie down
and cover yourself up.

17:35.304 --> 17:39.650
Don't cry, Jane.
I don't want you to cry.

17:43.854 --> 17:47.825
- Are you warm now?
- Yes.

17:48.651 --> 17:50.949
Good night, Jane.

17:51.112 --> 17:53.535
Good night, Helen.

17:58.202 --> 18:05.211
I... I do wish they
hadn't cut your hair.

18:10.881 --> 18:12.849
Helen.

18:13.134 --> 18:15.478
Are you awake?

18:16.012 --> 18:18.185
It's morning.

18:18.681 --> 18:20.649
Helen!

18:32.194 --> 18:34.242
Jane. Come, Jane.

18:34.405 --> 18:38.205
No, I want to stay here.
I want to be with Helen.

18:38.367 --> 18:42.497
Helen isn't here. Helen's with God.

18:43.581 --> 18:47.427
Jane, remember what you say
in your prayers every day?

18:47.585 --> 18:49.804
"Thy will be done."

18:49.962 --> 18:53.808
Do you think you're doing God's
will by giving way to despair?

18:54.091 --> 18:57.516
God wants children to
be brave and strong.

18:57.928 --> 19:00.397
Won't you do what God wants?

19:00.723 --> 19:03.772
- I'll try.
- That's right.

19:03.934 --> 19:07.108
Don't forget, the harder you
try, the more God will help you.

19:08.606 --> 19:09.858
Now let me take you back.

19:10.024 --> 19:12.527
No, I can't go back. I'll never
go back. I'll run away!

19:12.693 --> 19:15.196
Jane, you know what
duty is, don't you?

19:15.363 --> 19:18.708
Duty is what you have to do even
when you don't want to do it.

19:18.866 --> 19:21.870
I may not want to go out into a
snowstorm to visit a sick child...

19:22.036 --> 19:24.289
but I know I have to go
because it's my duty.

19:24.455 --> 19:27.334
- Now, what is your duty, Jane?
- I don't know.

19:27.541 --> 19:31.136
Yes, you do, Jane. In your
heart, you know perfectly well.

19:31.295 --> 19:36.802
Your duty is to prepare yourself to do
God's work in the world. Isn't that true?

19:37.343 --> 19:42.440
And who can do God's work? An
ignorant woman or an educated one?

19:42.640 --> 19:44.938
Yes, you know the answer to that.

19:45.101 --> 19:46.944
And where can you get
an education, Jane?

19:47.895 --> 19:50.364
- Where?
- At school.

19:50.564 --> 19:53.568
Precisely. So you know you
have to go back to school...

19:53.734 --> 19:58.160
even though you may hate the very
thought of it. Isn't that true?

20:00.866 --> 20:02.960
I suppose it is true.

20:04.620 --> 20:08.375
Good, Jane. Very good.

20:33.149 --> 20:36.029
True, gentlemen, we had some
difficulties in the beginning.

20:36.152 --> 20:38.701
A very stiff-necked and evil child.

20:39.196 --> 20:41.039
But Eyre has been with us 10 years.

20:41.198 --> 20:45.294
In those 10 years, it has been granted me
to plant her feet on the path of salvation.

20:45.453 --> 20:49.003
- I suppose we ought to see her.
- I intended that you should.

20:49.165 --> 20:51.259
Let Eyre be brought in.

20:51.709 --> 20:53.882
I don't need to remind
you of the advantages...

20:54.044 --> 20:56.718
of appointing one of our
own pupils as teacher.

20:56.881 --> 20:59.430
An outsider will have to
be paid twice as much.

21:03.512 --> 21:07.107
Eyre, this is a solemn moment.

21:07.266 --> 21:11.237
Little did I imagine that the unregenerate
child I received into this institution...

21:11.395 --> 21:14.319
would grow in 10 short
years to become a teacher.

21:14.482 --> 21:16.484
Yes, a teacher.

21:16.650 --> 21:19.449
That is the honor which the
trustees, at my recommendation...

21:19.612 --> 21:21.205
have now bestowed upon you.

21:21.530 --> 21:23.498
Your wages will be 20
guineas per annum...

21:23.657 --> 21:27.457
from which only 10 will be withheld for
lodging, spiritual instruction, laundry.

21:27.620 --> 21:30.169
Your duties will begin on the
first day of the new term.

21:30.748 --> 21:33.877
I need detain you no
longer, gentlemen.

21:43.761 --> 21:48.187
- Good day, gentlemen, good day.
- Here is the post, sir.

21:53.062 --> 21:54.564
That is all, Eyre.

21:58.567 --> 22:01.411
I cannot accept your offer, sir.

22:01.570 --> 22:05.040
- And why not, pray?
- I do not wish to stay at Lowood.

22:05.199 --> 22:07.668
But this is unheard of.

22:07.827 --> 22:11.422
- The ingratitude.
- What have I to be grateful for?

22:11.580 --> 22:14.629
- Ten years of harshness and...
- Silence!

22:17.503 --> 22:22.509
Stiff-necked as ever. I see that
I've been sadly deceived in you.

22:22.675 --> 22:25.554
And where, may I ask,
do you intend to go?

22:25.761 --> 22:29.561
- Out into the world, sir.
- Out into the world.

22:29.765 --> 22:32.939
You know how the world treats paupers
without friends or connections?

22:33.102 --> 22:35.025
I intend to find a
position as a governess.

22:35.187 --> 22:39.067
- How, may I ask?
- I've advertised in a newspaper.

22:39.275 --> 22:43.405
Oh, and doubtless you've been overwhelmed
with demands for your services.

22:43.571 --> 22:45.289
- No, sir.
- And you never will be.

22:45.447 --> 22:48.496
You have no talents, your disposition
is dark and rebellious...

22:48.659 --> 22:50.457
your appearance insignificant.

22:50.619 --> 22:53.623
It's folly to dream
of such a position.

23:02.923 --> 23:06.018
Eyre, you heard me.

23:06.385 --> 23:09.685
I'm willing to overlook your
ungracious outburst, but I warn you:

23:09.847 --> 23:14.819
If you persist in your folly, this
haven will never again be open to you.

23:15.728 --> 23:18.072
I am leaving Lowood, sir.

23:48.761 --> 23:51.685
Here you are, miss. Right-o.

23:51.847 --> 23:55.317
Jane, it's not every young woman that
can face the world single-handed.

23:55.476 --> 23:58.650
But you know what right is. You'll
stick to it through thick and thin.

24:21.210 --> 24:22.382
Twenty pounds is my limit.

24:22.544 --> 24:26.139
No, no, no. Make it guineas
and they're yours, lad.

24:26.298 --> 24:28.721
Excuse me. Could you tell me
if there's anyone here...

24:28.884 --> 24:30.727
from Mrs. Fairfax
at Thornfield Hall?

24:30.886 --> 24:34.231
Not that I've heard, ma'am. Take seat
in coffee room and I'll inquire.

24:34.390 --> 24:37.360
- Who's the young lady?
- Couldn't say. Just come in by coach.

24:37.518 --> 24:40.818
Give her my compliments and ask her
to join me in a glass of Madeira.

24:40.980 --> 24:42.732
Yes, sir.

24:44.441 --> 24:46.614
Gentleman over there
presents his compliments...

24:46.777 --> 24:48.950
asks if you'd take a glass
of summat with him.

24:49.279 --> 24:53.409
Oh, no, thank you.
I never take wine.

25:02.668 --> 25:04.090
Is your name Eyre?

25:04.253 --> 25:06.631
Yes, I'm Miss Eyre. Are
you from Thornfield?

25:06.797 --> 25:09.220
- You're not the new governess?
- Yes, I am.

25:09.383 --> 25:13.433
- Heh, is this all your luggage?
- Yes.

26:12.029 --> 26:16.000
- I'll tell Mrs. Fairfax you're here.
- Thank you.

26:32.299 --> 26:34.518
How do you do, my dear?

26:34.676 --> 26:39.773
I'm afraid you've had a tedious
journey. I'm Mrs. Fairfax.

26:39.932 --> 26:44.108
Why, your hand is like ice. Come,
I'll take you straight to your room.

26:44.269 --> 26:46.692
We've a nice, cozy fire
burning there for you...

26:46.855 --> 26:51.201
and Leah's taken the chill off
the sheet with the warming pan.

26:52.361 --> 26:54.534
You know, dear, I'm
so glad you've come.

26:54.696 --> 26:56.824
Living here with no company
but the servants...

26:56.990 --> 26:59.914
it's not too cheerful,
I can tell you.

27:00.077 --> 27:03.547
I do declare, not a living creature
but the butcher and the postman...

27:03.705 --> 27:06.709
has come to this house since
the hard weather set in.

27:06.875 --> 27:09.628
Shall I have the pleasure of
seeing Miss Fairfax tonight?

27:09.795 --> 27:13.174
Miss Fairfax? Oh, you
mean Miss Adele.

27:13.340 --> 27:16.970
- Isn't she your daughter?
- Oh, gracious, no. Adele is French.

27:17.136 --> 27:20.231
I have no family. No family at all.

27:20.389 --> 27:21.857
That's Mr. Edward's room.

27:22.015 --> 27:24.689
He's abroad, of course, but I
always keep it ready for him.

27:24.852 --> 27:27.822
His visits are always so
unexpected and sudden.

27:27.980 --> 27:32.326
A wanderer on the face of the earth,
that's what Mr. Edward is, I'm afraid.

27:32.484 --> 27:34.327
Mr. Edward? Who is Mr. Edward?

27:34.486 --> 27:36.580
Why, the owner of
Thornfield, of course.

27:36.738 --> 27:40.083
- Oh, I thought this was your house.
- Mine? Bless your soul, child.

27:40.242 --> 27:41.710
I'm only the housekeeper.

27:41.869 --> 27:46.875
Thornfield belongs to Mr. Edward
Rochester, and little Adele is his ward.

27:47.040 --> 27:49.839
And here is your room, my dear.
It's quite small...

27:50.002 --> 27:53.597
but I thought you'd like it better
than one of the large front chambers.

27:53.755 --> 27:55.757
Oh, it's very beautiful.

27:55.924 --> 28:00.054
I can't understand why a gentleman with a
house like this so seldom comes to it.

28:00.220 --> 28:02.518
It is strange. But you'll
find, Miss Eyre...

28:02.681 --> 28:06.151
that in many ways,
Mr. Edward is a strange man.

28:06.310 --> 28:09.985
- Good night, my dear.
- Good night.

28:45.432 --> 28:47.059
<i>Bonjour, mademoiselle.</i>

28:47.226 --> 28:49.524
Mama had a dress like
that, mademoiselle.

28:49.686 --> 28:53.987
Only she could dance much more
beautifully. I can dance too.

28:54.149 --> 28:56.948
- Do you wish to see?
- Now? At this very moment?

28:57.319 --> 29:02.246
Now you speak like Monsieur Rochester.
For him it is never the right moment.

29:04.660 --> 29:06.412
Your name's Adele, isn't it?

29:07.412 --> 29:10.211
Do you know what I
was thinking, Adele?

29:10.999 --> 29:15.095
I was just thinking that never in my life
have I been awakened so happily.

29:35.023 --> 29:37.776
- You like that, mademoiselle?
- Very much, Adele.

29:37.943 --> 29:40.913
A great many gentlemen and
ladies came to see Mama...

29:41.071 --> 29:45.042
and I used to dance before them, or
sit on their knees and sing to them.

29:45.200 --> 29:46.247
I liked it.

29:46.410 --> 29:50.040
- And where was that?
- In Paris. We live always in Paris.

29:50.205 --> 29:52.879
But then when Mama had to
go to the Holy Virgin...

29:53.041 --> 29:56.386
Monsieur Rochester came and
took me across the sea...

29:56.545 --> 30:01.221
in a great ship with a chimney
that smoked, and I was sick.

30:02.718 --> 30:05.562
Five, six and three?

30:08.390 --> 30:11.314
- Do you like Monsieur Rochester?
- I've not met him yet.

30:11.476 --> 30:12.944
This is his chair.

30:13.103 --> 30:18.155
He sits here and stares into
the fire and frowns like this:

30:19.901 --> 30:22.324
- Is he as bad as that?
- Twice as bad.

30:22.571 --> 30:25.871
- I cannot make how bad he is.
- But I'm sure he's very kind to you.

30:26.033 --> 30:29.082
Oh, sometimes he brings
me beautiful presents.

30:29.244 --> 30:32.589
But when he's angry,
that's terrible.

30:32.789 --> 30:35.588
And may the Holy
Virgin give me grace.

30:35.751 --> 30:40.757
And God bless Monsieur Rochester and
make him polite to mademoiselle...

30:40.922 --> 30:46.429
so she will stay with me
forever and ever. Amen.

31:45.821 --> 31:48.074
- Can I do anything?
- You can stand out of the way.

31:48.281 --> 31:51.911
- I'm sorry I frightened your horse.
- Apologies won't mend my ankle.

31:52.077 --> 31:53.420
Down, Pilot!

31:53.578 --> 31:55.062
Well, what are you waiting for?

31:55.088 --> 31:57.528
I can't leave until I
see you're fit to ride.

31:57.666 --> 32:00.465
Hmm, you have a will of your own.

32:00.627 --> 32:03.597
- Where are you from?
- From Mr. Rochester's house, just below.

32:04.131 --> 32:07.135
- Do you know Mr. Rochester?
- No, I've never seen him.

32:07.968 --> 32:12.644
- You're not a servant at the hall.
- I'm the new governess.

32:12.806 --> 32:14.103
Oh.

32:16.435 --> 32:17.857
You're the new governess.

32:28.947 --> 32:31.621
Now, just hand me my whip.

32:35.078 --> 32:37.126
Thank you. Now kindly
get out of the way.

33:04.065 --> 33:07.410
Quick, dear. Off with your things.
He's been asking to see the governess.

33:07.569 --> 33:09.947
- Who?
- Why, Mr. Rochester, of course.

33:10.113 --> 33:13.834
Rode in on us suddenly without any
warning, and in such a vile humor.

33:13.992 --> 33:16.245
Seems he had an accident.
I don't know what to do.

33:16.411 --> 33:21.167
He won't let me send for the doctor.
Oh, my goodness, your bonnet.

33:21.458 --> 33:24.132
Here is Miss Eyre, sir.

33:49.486 --> 33:51.363
Well, Miss Eyre,
have you no tongue?

33:51.530 --> 33:53.828
- I was waiting until I was spoken to.
- Very proper.

33:53.990 --> 33:57.494
Next time you see a man on a horse,
don't run into the road till he's passed.

33:57.661 --> 33:58.708
It was not deliberate.

33:58.870 --> 34:02.716
It may not have been deliberate,
it was nonetheless painful.

34:02.874 --> 34:05.252
Sit down, Miss Eyre.

34:10.005 --> 34:13.351
- Where do you come from?
- From Lowood Institution, sir.

34:13.510 --> 34:15.387
Lowood? What's that?

34:15.554 --> 34:17.976
It's a charity school.
I was there 10 years.

34:18.139 --> 34:22.018
Ten years. You must
be tenacious of life.

34:22.185 --> 34:25.280
No wonder you have rather
the look of another world.

34:25.480 --> 34:27.733
I marveled where you
got that sort of face.

34:28.190 --> 34:31.070
When you came on me in the mist,
I was thinking of fairy tales.

34:31.235 --> 34:36.367
Half a mind to demand whether
you'd bewitched my horse.

34:36.699 --> 34:39.418
Indeed, I'm not sure yet.

34:40.996 --> 34:43.795
- Who are your parents?
- I have none, sir.

34:43.998 --> 34:47.424
- And your home?
- I have no home, sir.

34:47.627 --> 34:49.049
Who recommended you here?

34:49.254 --> 34:52.224
I advertised and Mrs. Fairfax
answered the advertisement.

34:52.382 --> 34:55.601
Heh, and you came posthaste to be here
in time to throw me off my horse.

34:55.760 --> 35:01.267
Hmm. What did you learn at Lowood?
Do you play the piano?

35:02.225 --> 35:03.568
A little.

35:03.727 --> 35:06.276
Of course, it is the
established answer.

35:06.813 --> 35:08.406
Go into the drawing room.

35:09.566 --> 35:11.910
I mean, if you please.

35:12.944 --> 35:16.289
Excuse my tone of command. I'm used
to saying, "Do this," and it is done.

35:16.448 --> 35:18.997
I cannot alter my customary
habits for one new inmate.

35:19.159 --> 35:22.003
Take a candle with you,
leave the door open.

35:22.537 --> 35:25.586
Sit down at the piano
and play a tune.

35:55.070 --> 35:56.492
Enough!

36:11.878 --> 36:16.634
You play a little, I see. Like
any other English schoolgirl.

36:16.800 --> 36:19.974
Perhaps rather better than some.

36:20.136 --> 36:21.729
But not well.

36:24.641 --> 36:26.393
Good night, Miss Eyre.

36:26.893 --> 36:28.736
Good night.

36:38.955 --> 36:41.557
<i>What sort of man was this
master of Thornfield...</i>

36:41.563 --> 36:44.045
<i>so proud, sardonic and harsh?</i>

36:44.346 --> 36:49.246
<i>Instinctively I felt that his malignant mood
had its source in some cruel cross of fate.</i>

36:49.597 --> 36:52.072
<i>I was to learn that
this was indeed true,</i>

36:52.152 --> 36:54.738
<i>and that beneath the
harsh mask he assumed</i>

36:54.822 --> 36:58.965
<i>lay a tortured soul,
fine, gentle and kindly.</i>

37:03.012 --> 37:05.435
Grace, what are you thinking about?

37:05.640 --> 37:08.644
I told you time and again I could
hear you all over the house.

37:08.810 --> 37:09.857
Too much noise, Grace.

37:10.103 --> 37:12.777
I've spoken to you before.

37:15.859 --> 37:20.410
Did I disturb you, my dear? I'm so sorry.
I had to say something to Grace Poole.

37:20.572 --> 37:22.495
She's a person we have
to do the sewing.

37:22.657 --> 37:25.706
Not altogether unobjectionable,
but she does her work.

37:25.869 --> 37:28.463
How did you get on with
Mr. Rochester, my dear?

37:28.663 --> 37:31.212
Is he always so
changeful and abrupt?

37:31.374 --> 37:34.298
Well, he has his little peculiarities
of temper, of course...

37:34.461 --> 37:36.213
but then, allowances
should be made.

37:36.379 --> 37:38.222
Why for him more than
for anyone else?

37:38.381 --> 37:40.179
Partly because that's his nature.

37:40.341 --> 37:43.060
And partly, too, because
he has painful thoughts.

37:43.219 --> 37:46.223
- What about?
- Family troubles.

37:46.389 --> 37:49.233
I think that's why he so
seldom comes to Thornfield.

37:49.392 --> 37:52.566
It has unpleasant
associations for him.

37:52.729 --> 37:54.777
Good night, my dear.

37:54.939 --> 37:56.987
Good night, Mrs. Fairfax.

38:24.803 --> 38:29.934
Monsieur Rochester is very difficult, but
he brings the most beautiful presents.

38:30.099 --> 38:32.773
Look, mademoiselle. Mademoiselle.

38:33.770 --> 38:37.775
You see, they suit me perfectly.

39:04.050 --> 39:07.725
A ballet dress, just
like Mama used to wear.

39:07.887 --> 39:10.561
Isn't it beautiful, mademoiselle?

39:10.765 --> 39:16.488
- Beautiful, Adele.
- I shall wear it when I dance. Always, heh.

39:20.316 --> 39:21.363
Miss Eyre.

39:22.777 --> 39:24.905
That's enough, I daresay.

39:25.405 --> 39:26.782
Miss Eyre.

39:32.579 --> 39:35.879
I'm not fond of the
prattle of children.

39:36.499 --> 39:39.002
As you see, I'm a
crusty old bachelor...

39:39.168 --> 39:43.719
and I have no pleasant associations
connected with their lisp.

39:43.882 --> 39:48.729
In this house, the only alternative is the
prattle of a simple-minded old lady...

39:48.887 --> 39:50.764
which is nearly as bad.

39:50.930 --> 39:53.604
Today I feel disposed
to be gregarious...

39:53.808 --> 39:56.687
and communicative and
I believe you could amuse me.

39:58.605 --> 40:01.950
You puzzled me a great deal that first
evening in the library, Miss Eyre.

40:02.108 --> 40:04.076
I'd almost forgotten you since...

40:04.235 --> 40:08.911
but now I'm resolved to be at ease,
to do only what pleases me.

40:09.073 --> 40:12.748
It would please me now to draw
you out, to learn more of you.

40:12.911 --> 40:14.538
Sit down, Miss Eyre.

40:14.704 --> 40:20.211
No, not further back. Down
just here, where I placed it.

40:20.418 --> 40:23.217
Uh, forward a little.
Still too far back.

40:23.379 --> 40:27.134
I can't see you without disturbing my
position in this comfortable chair...

40:27.300 --> 40:29.394
which I have no mind to do.

40:31.971 --> 40:34.815
You examine me, Miss Eyre.

40:34.974 --> 40:37.898
- Do you find me handsome?
- No, sir.

40:38.061 --> 40:39.404
Indeed.

40:39.562 --> 40:42.566
I beg your pardon, I was too plain.
My answer was a mistake.

40:42.732 --> 40:45.906
Just so, and you shall be answerable
for it. Now, then, explain.

40:46.069 --> 40:47.662
Does my forehead not please you?

40:47.904 --> 40:50.407
What do you tell from
my head? Am I a fool?

40:50.573 --> 40:51.916
No, sir, far from it.

40:52.075 --> 40:54.248
Would you say it is the
head of a kindly man?

40:54.452 --> 40:57.296
- Hardly that, sir.
- Very well, madam.

40:57.455 --> 41:00.459
I am not a kindly man.

41:00.625 --> 41:05.096
Though I did once have a
sort of tenderness of heart.

41:05.254 --> 41:06.506
- You doubt that?
- No, sir.

41:06.673 --> 41:09.392
Fortune's knocked me about,
kneaded me with her knuckles...

41:09.550 --> 41:13.180
till now I flatter myself I am as hard
and tough as an India-rubber ball...

41:13.388 --> 41:18.144
with perhaps one small sensitive
point in the middle of the lump.

41:18.309 --> 41:21.279
- Does that leave hope for me?
- Hope of what, sir?

41:21.437 --> 41:24.611
My retransformation from
India rubber back to flesh.

41:26.943 --> 41:29.287
You look very puzzled, young lady.

41:29.445 --> 41:33.245
And a puzzled air becomes you.

41:33.825 --> 41:38.126
Besides, it keeps those searching
eyes of yours away from my face.

41:38.788 --> 41:42.793
You are silent,
Miss Eyre. Stubborn?

41:43.960 --> 41:46.554
No, annoyed, and quite rightly so.

41:46.713 --> 41:48.386
I put my request in an absurd way.

41:48.548 --> 41:52.143
The fact is, once and for all, I do
not wish to treat you as an inferior.

41:52.301 --> 41:55.555
But I've battled through a varied
experience with men of many nations...

41:55.722 --> 41:58.817
roamed over half the globe, while
you've spent your whole life...

41:58.975 --> 42:01.398
with one set of
people in one house.

42:01.561 --> 42:04.440
Don't you agree that gives me a
right to be masterful and abrupt?

42:04.605 --> 42:06.027
Do as you please, sir.

42:06.190 --> 42:08.909
You pay me 30 pounds a year
for receiving your orders.

42:09.694 --> 42:11.571
Thirty pounds? I'd quite
forgotten that, heh.

42:11.738 --> 42:15.288
Well, heh, on that mercenary ground, won't
you agree to let me hector you a little?

42:15.450 --> 42:18.078
No, sir, not on that ground,
but on the ground...

42:18.244 --> 42:21.874
that you did forget it and inquired
of my feelings as an equal.

42:22.040 --> 42:26.011
Good. Well, then. You'll let me
dispense of the conventional forms...

42:26.169 --> 42:27.671
without thinking me insolent?

42:27.837 --> 42:30.761
I should never mistake
informality for insolence.

42:30.923 --> 42:36.054
One I rather like. The other, no freeborn
person would submit to even for a salary.

42:36.220 --> 42:38.973
Humbug. Most freeborn people
submit to anything for a salary.

42:39.140 --> 42:41.609
- Where are you going?
- It's time for Adele's lesson.

42:41.768 --> 42:46.274
Heh, no, young lady. It's not
for Adele that you're going.

42:46.439 --> 42:48.942
It's because you're afraid of me.
You wish to escape me.

42:49.108 --> 42:52.362
In my presence, you are
hesitant to smile gaily...

42:52.528 --> 42:55.202
or speak too freely.

42:55.364 --> 42:58.038
- Admit that you're afraid.
- I'm bewildered, sir.

42:58.201 --> 42:59.578
But I'm certainly not afraid.

43:02.080 --> 43:04.674
Don't I look beautiful, monsieur?

43:04.832 --> 43:08.132
This is how Mama used
to do it, is it not?

43:08.294 --> 43:09.546
Precisely.

43:10.963 --> 43:13.887
That's how she charmed my English
gold out of my breeches pocket.

43:14.050 --> 43:17.554
- And I shall dance for you?
- You will not.

43:17.720 --> 43:20.314
- Go straight upstairs to the nursery.
- But, monsieur...

43:20.473 --> 43:22.441
At once.

43:26.979 --> 43:28.777
Miss Eyre.

43:29.649 --> 43:32.027
I'm not finished talking to you.

43:39.075 --> 43:41.077
Why are you looking
at me like that?

43:41.244 --> 43:44.464
I was thinking, whatever
your past misfortune...

43:44.622 --> 43:47.000
you have no right to revenge
yourself on a child.

43:47.166 --> 43:48.793
You're quite right, of course.

43:48.960 --> 43:51.713
I was thinking only of myself,
my own memories and feelings.

43:51.879 --> 43:58.012
The fact is, nature meant me to
be, on the whole, a good man.

43:58.803 --> 44:03.274
One of the better kind. But
circumstance decreed otherwise, heh.

44:03.432 --> 44:07.482
I was as green as you once.
Uh, grass green.

44:07.645 --> 44:10.990
Now my spring is gone,
leaving me what?

44:11.190 --> 44:15.161
This little artificial
French flower.

44:18.823 --> 44:20.120
You may go, Miss Eyre.

44:24.787 --> 44:26.664
Miss Eyre.

44:37.216 --> 44:42.347
- Hope you'll be happy here at Thornfield.
- I hope so, sir. I think so.

44:43.472 --> 44:44.724
I'm glad.

45:11.626 --> 45:12.752
Who's there?

45:31.187 --> 45:32.530
Mr. Rochester!

45:48.996 --> 45:50.122
That's done it.

45:50.289 --> 45:53.884
I think someone must've tried to kill you.
I heard footsteps along the gallery.

45:54.043 --> 45:55.386
Shall I call Mrs. Fairfax?

45:55.544 --> 45:57.672
What the deuce do you
want to call her for?

45:57.838 --> 45:59.465
Let her sleep. Come and sit down.

45:59.632 --> 46:01.726
I'm going to leave you here.

46:02.885 --> 46:04.728
Be still as a mouse.

47:04.530 --> 47:08.034
When you came out of your
room, did you see anything?

47:08.200 --> 47:12.125
Only a candlestick on the floor.
But I... I heard a door shut.

47:12.288 --> 47:15.383
- Anything else?
- Yes. Kind of a laugh.

47:15.541 --> 47:19.637
A kind of a laugh. Have
you heard it before?

47:19.795 --> 47:22.389
There's a strange woman here
called Grace Poole that I...

47:22.548 --> 47:24.095
Aah, just so.

47:24.967 --> 47:26.765
Grace Poole.

47:27.178 --> 47:31.854
You've guessed it. Well,
I see what's to be done.

47:32.475 --> 47:34.603
Meanwhile, say nothing
about this to anyone.

47:34.769 --> 47:37.613
Adele. We forgot the child.

47:46.906 --> 47:48.499
I had an awful fear.

47:48.657 --> 47:51.831
- You see what she has?
- Poor little Adele.

47:51.994 --> 47:54.838
Trying to console herself
for my unkindness to her.

47:54.997 --> 47:57.250
The child has dancing
in her blood...

47:57.458 --> 47:59.927
and coquetry in the very
marrow of her bones.

48:07.009 --> 48:09.888
I once had the misfortune
to be in love with this...

48:10.054 --> 48:12.182
and to be jealous of that.

48:12.348 --> 48:14.396
Love's a strange thing, Miss Eyre.

48:14.558 --> 48:18.984
You can know that a person's worthless,
without heart or mind or scruple...

48:19.146 --> 48:22.571
and yet suffer to the point of
torture when she betrays you.

48:22.733 --> 48:26.909
At least I had the pleasure of putting a
pistol bullet through my rival's lungs.

48:27.071 --> 48:30.075
- And the little doll in the dancing skirt?
- We tell Adele she died.

48:30.241 --> 48:33.245
The truth isn't quite so touching.

48:33.411 --> 48:35.334
I gave her some money
and turned her out...

48:35.496 --> 48:39.251
whereupon she decamped
with an Italian painter...

48:39.417 --> 48:42.296
leaving me with what she
said was my daughter.

48:44.004 --> 48:46.223
Let me light you to your room.

48:47.842 --> 48:49.890
Well, Miss Eyre...

48:50.845 --> 48:54.190
now that you know
what your pupil is...

48:55.057 --> 48:58.482
the offspring of a
French dancing girl...

48:58.644 --> 49:01.989
I suppose you'll be coming to tell
me to look out for a new governess.

49:02.148 --> 49:05.573
Adele has had so little love.
I shall try to make up for it.

49:05.734 --> 49:08.283
Are you always drawn to the
loveless and unfriended?

49:08.446 --> 49:10.619
When it's deserved.

49:16.579 --> 49:18.502
Would you say that my
life deserved saving?

49:19.498 --> 49:21.717
I should be distressed if
harm came to you, sir.

49:23.127 --> 49:26.381
But you did save my life tonight, and
I should like to thank you for it.

49:26.547 --> 49:28.345
At least shake hands.

49:31.552 --> 49:34.726
I knew you'd do me good
in some way, sometime.

49:37.558 --> 49:40.277
- Good night, Jane.
- Good night, sir.

50:19.600 --> 50:23.480
Oh, Miss Eyre, isn't it terrible? We
might all have been burnt in our beds.

50:24.230 --> 50:25.652
Where did Mr. Rochester go?

50:25.814 --> 50:28.112
Well, he said something
about a party at Millcote.

50:28.275 --> 50:30.073
Goodness knows how
long he'll be away.

50:30.236 --> 50:35.618
One can never tell with Mr. Rochester.
It may be a day or a year or a month.

50:39.119 --> 50:40.917
- Mrs. Fairfax?
- Yes, my dear?

50:41.080 --> 50:43.299
Did Mr. Rochester tell you
how the fire started?

50:43.457 --> 50:44.709
Why, of course.

50:44.875 --> 50:47.503
He was reading in bed and fell
asleep with the candle lit.

50:47.670 --> 50:50.799
And the curtains took fire.
Why do you ask?

50:51.549 --> 50:54.894
I wondered if the fire had anything
to do with Mr. Rochester's leaving.

50:55.052 --> 50:56.850
What possible connection
could there be?

50:57.012 --> 50:58.935
He said this morning
that he was restless.

50:59.098 --> 51:03.444
The house with only us here was
unbearably oppressive for him.

51:54.320 --> 51:57.119
What art thou doing here?

51:57.823 --> 52:02.920
No one is allowed up here.
Understand? No one.

52:03.078 --> 52:05.126
Get thee down.

52:15.675 --> 52:18.823
<i>Had the mystery in the tower
driven him madly away,</i>

52:18.824 --> 52:21.125
<i>just as we seemed
so close together?</i>

52:21.526 --> 52:24.484
<i>...Winter turned to spring
and no news came,</i>

52:25.030 --> 52:28.049
<i>but I found a measure of escape
in the happiness of Adele.</i>

52:39.365 --> 52:41.663
Look, mademoiselle.

52:54.922 --> 52:56.924
Now, the moment the
carriages stop...

52:57.091 --> 52:58.843
be ready to take the
gentlemen's cloaks.

52:59.009 --> 53:00.689
- Yes, madam.
- I'm glad so you're back.

53:00.844 --> 53:02.312
Mr. Rochester is so difficult.

53:02.471 --> 53:05.145
Leah, you must be with me to
take the ladies to their rooms.

53:05.307 --> 53:06.479
Yes, madam.

53:06.642 --> 53:09.020
Imagine not telling me how
many guests he's bringing.

53:09.186 --> 53:13.657
Just said, "Get all the best bedrooms
ready and more servants from the inn."

53:16.068 --> 53:17.786
They're coming, ma'am.

53:23.867 --> 53:29.715
One, two, three. Oh, dear, 15 at least.
Far more than I prepared for.

53:43.637 --> 53:47.813
- Who's that riding with Mr. Rochester?
- Why, that's Blanche Ingram, my dear.

53:47.975 --> 53:50.979
Haven't you heard about Miss
Ingram and Mr. Rochester?

53:51.145 --> 53:53.398
She's quite an old flame of his.

53:53.564 --> 53:57.489
It wouldn't surprise me if it came
to an engagement one of these days.

53:57.651 --> 54:00.325
Such a beautiful girl, isn't she?

54:09.663 --> 54:11.256
Where's Miss Ingram's bath?

54:11.415 --> 54:14.009
Coming as quickly as we can.

54:16.420 --> 54:18.468
Adele, why aren't
you in the nursery?

54:18.630 --> 54:20.007
Mademoiselle, let me look.

54:20.174 --> 54:22.427
No, dear, you're in the way.

54:22.593 --> 54:25.187
Didn't I tell you that Blanche
had set her cap at him?

54:25.345 --> 54:29.896
Well, he is very romantic,
and enormously rich.

54:40.027 --> 54:41.870
Oh, Miss Eyre,
Mr. Rochester wishes you...

54:42.029 --> 54:44.248
to bring Adele to the
drawing room after dinner.

54:44.406 --> 54:46.875
Oh, please send Adele by herself.

54:47.034 --> 54:48.786
He only asked me out of politeness.

54:48.952 --> 54:52.252
That's what I thought, and I told
him you weren't used to company.

54:52.414 --> 54:56.044
"Nonsense," he said. "if she objects,
I'll come and fetch her myself."

54:56.210 --> 54:59.760
Of course, you must wear
your very best, my dear.

55:02.007 --> 55:04.101
I think the black.

55:08.305 --> 55:10.683
Then I got two more birds
with my spare gun, heh.

55:10.849 --> 55:13.602
Well, perhaps we'd better leave
the gentlemen to their port.

55:16.563 --> 55:19.032
They're coming, mademoiselle.

55:32.538 --> 55:34.085
- What's your name?
- Adele.

55:35.415 --> 55:38.840
Now, Blanche, stop teasing
Mr. Rochester. Come along, my angel.

56:29.011 --> 56:34.063
Splendid match, Sir George.
Six or 7000 a year at least.

56:37.436 --> 56:41.907
- What a striking couple.
- Very fortunate, isn't it?

56:42.441 --> 56:44.785
Fine shoulders, eh, Ned?

57:14.681 --> 57:16.399
Mr. Rochester, may I sing now?

57:16.558 --> 57:18.026
I think we've had enough music.

57:18.185 --> 57:21.029
- I thought you weren't fond of children.
- Nor am I. Run along.

57:21.188 --> 57:24.317
What induced you to take charge of
a poppet? Where'd you pick her up?

57:24.483 --> 57:26.827
I did not pick her up. She
was left on my hands.

57:26.985 --> 57:28.987
Well, I suppose you have
a governess for her.

57:29.154 --> 57:32.033
I saw a person with her
just now. Is she gone?

57:32.199 --> 57:34.543
Oh, no, there she is, still
hiding in the corner.

57:34.701 --> 57:37.295
You should hear Mama on the
subject of governesses.

57:37.454 --> 57:40.503
Governesses? Don't speak
to me of governesses, heh.

57:40.666 --> 57:43.545
The martyrdom I've endured
with those creatures.

57:43.710 --> 57:47.681
The clever ones are detestable,
and the others are grotesque.

58:09.361 --> 58:12.331
- How do you do?
- Very well, sir.

58:12.489 --> 58:15.368
Why did you not come speak
to me in the drawing room?

58:15.534 --> 58:19.414
I did not wish to disturb
you, as you seemed engaged.

58:20.038 --> 58:23.338
- What have you been doing?
- Teaching Adele, as usual.

58:23.542 --> 58:28.048
Yes, and getting a good deal paler
than you were. What's the matter?

58:29.381 --> 58:31.008
Nothing.

58:31.591 --> 58:34.014
Take cold the night of the fire?

58:34.469 --> 58:35.721
No, sir.

58:36.304 --> 58:40.684
Go back to the drawing room.
You're leaving too early.

58:42.144 --> 58:43.396
I'm a little tired, sir.

58:43.562 --> 58:48.739
Yes, and a little depressed.
What about?

58:49.276 --> 58:50.619
I'm not depressed, sir.

58:51.820 --> 58:54.539
But I tell you, you are.

58:54.865 --> 58:58.335
So much depressed that a few words more
and there'll be tears in your eyes.

59:00.287 --> 59:04.042
Indeed, they're there now,
shining and swimming.

59:05.834 --> 59:07.086
What devil's that?

59:10.172 --> 59:12.800
- I wish to see Mr. Rochester.
- What name shall I say, sir?

59:12.966 --> 59:16.140
Tell him Mr. Mason. Mr. Mason
of Spanish Town, Jamaica.

59:16.303 --> 59:18.180
Very good, sir.

59:20.599 --> 59:23.853
Mason of Spanish Town.

59:28.231 --> 59:31.235
I wish I were on a quiet
island with only you.

59:31.860 --> 59:35.615
Trouble and danger and hideous
recollection far away.

59:35.822 --> 59:37.574
Can I help you, sir?

59:37.949 --> 59:42.170
If help is needed, I'll seek it at
your hands. Promise you that.

59:42.954 --> 59:45.628
Jane, if all the people in that
room came and spat on me...

59:47.793 --> 59:49.591
what would you do?

59:50.128 --> 59:53.007
I'd turn them out of
the room if I could.

59:53.173 --> 59:58.805
If I were to go to them and they
only looked coldly at me...

59:59.596 --> 01:00:03.772
and dropped off and
left me, one by one...

01:00:04.768 --> 01:00:06.111
what then?

01:00:08.355 --> 01:00:10.449
Would you go with them?

01:00:11.691 --> 01:00:13.238
I would stay with you, sir.

01:00:14.694 --> 01:00:18.198
- To comfort me?
- Yes, sir.

01:00:19.074 --> 01:00:22.874
To comfort you as well as I could.

01:00:33.839 --> 01:00:35.091
Edward.

01:00:35.257 --> 01:00:39.262
I shall not be so hypocritical as to
say you are welcome in this house.

01:00:39.427 --> 01:00:41.225
Follow me, Mason.

01:00:59.906 --> 01:01:03.706
- What is it? What's happened?
- The noise came from down there.

01:01:12.919 --> 01:01:14.921
- Where the devil's Edward?
- Here he is.

01:01:15.088 --> 01:01:18.137
Edward! Edward, you haven't
been hurt, have you?

01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:21.224
Put that pistol away, colonel.
Artillery's no good for nightmares.

01:01:21.386 --> 01:01:22.947
- Nightmares?
- That's all it was.

01:01:23.054 --> 01:01:24.431
One of the maids had a bad
dream, woke up screaming.

01:01:24.598 --> 01:01:25.645
Oh.

01:01:25.807 --> 01:01:28.651
The moral of that is don't eat
toasted cheese for supper.

01:01:30.020 --> 01:01:33.365
Now, ladies, you all go to your rooms.
Lady Ingram, you set the good example.

01:01:33.523 --> 01:01:35.070
I declare, I'm quite disappointed.

01:01:35.233 --> 01:01:38.203
I was so looking forward to seeing
Uncle Percy shoot a robber.

01:01:38.361 --> 01:01:40.363
Now, Blanche, less of your levity.

01:01:42.157 --> 01:01:43.579
Good night, Edward.

01:01:44.409 --> 01:01:47.709
Sweet dreams, my
courageous Blanche.

01:02:03.553 --> 01:02:06.102
- Jane, are you awake?
- Yes, sir.

01:02:06.264 --> 01:02:08.517
Come out, then, quietly.

01:02:12.270 --> 01:02:14.614
Come this way and make no noise.

01:02:25.742 --> 01:02:27.995
You don't turn sick at the
sight of blood, do you?

01:02:28.161 --> 01:02:30.960
- I've never been tried.
- Give me your hand.

01:02:31.373 --> 01:02:36.345
It won't do to risk a fainting fit.
Warm and steady.

01:02:40.382 --> 01:02:46.230
Jane, what you see may shock
and frighten and confuse you.

01:02:46.388 --> 01:02:50.063
I beg you not to seek an explanation.
Don't try to understand.

01:02:52.060 --> 01:02:55.439
Whatever the appearance,
you must trust me.

01:03:11.329 --> 01:03:16.335
Jane, I'm going to leave you in
this room with this gentleman...

01:03:16.501 --> 01:03:18.549
while I fetch a surgeon.

01:03:18.712 --> 01:03:21.181
You will sponge the
blood as I do now.

01:03:21.339 --> 01:03:25.560
If he comes to, do not speak to him on
any account. Do you understand me?

01:03:25.719 --> 01:03:27.892
Whatever happens,
do not move from here.

01:03:28.054 --> 01:03:32.525
Whatever happens, do not
open a door. Either door.

01:04:37.957 --> 01:04:39.300
Doctor, be on the alert.

01:04:39.459 --> 01:04:42.588
I give you half an hour for dressing the
wound, getting the patient downstairs.

01:04:42.754 --> 01:04:44.677
- Huh, I'm done for, I fear.
- Nonsense.

01:04:44.839 --> 01:04:48.239
- You've lost a little blood, that's all.
- She sank her teeth into me like a tigress.

01:04:49.552 --> 01:04:52.193
- She said she'd drain my heart's...
- Be silent, Mason. Forget it!

01:04:54.641 --> 01:04:56.484
- Jane.
- Yes, sir?

01:04:56.684 --> 01:04:58.357
Go and get some things on.

01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:01.740
Go down the back stairs,
unbolt the side passage door.

01:05:01.898 --> 01:05:03.366
You'll find a carriage waiting.

01:05:04.651 --> 01:05:06.870
See that the driver's ready.

01:05:07.529 --> 01:05:09.873
I shall be down in a moment.

01:05:16.496 --> 01:05:17.873
Mason.

01:05:18.581 --> 01:05:20.254
I told you not to come up here!

01:05:20.458 --> 01:05:25.715
- I thought I could've done some good.
- You thought, you thought!

01:05:27.090 --> 01:05:29.684
Come, doctor, hurry.
We must have him off.

01:05:31.553 --> 01:05:34.932
I've tried so long
to avoid exposure.

01:05:36.099 --> 01:05:38.727
I shall make very certain
it doesn't come now.

01:05:42.814 --> 01:05:44.407
Take care of him, doctor.

01:05:44.566 --> 01:05:47.661
Don't let him leave your
house until he's quite well.

01:05:51.406 --> 01:05:52.828
- Edward.
- Well, what is it?

01:05:52.991 --> 01:05:56.120
Let her be taken care of. Let her
be treated as tenderly as may be.

01:05:56.286 --> 01:05:59.415
I do my best, and have
done it and will do it.

01:06:11.634 --> 01:06:16.435
Jane, come here a few minutes
where there's some freshness.

01:06:16.931 --> 01:06:19.980
That house is a
dungeon, a sepulcher.

01:06:20.143 --> 01:06:23.613
Here, everything is fresh, real...

01:06:24.230 --> 01:06:26.028
and pure.

01:06:28.443 --> 01:06:32.869
You've passed a strange night,
Jane. You're a little pale.

01:06:33.031 --> 01:06:37.457
Mr. Rochester, will Grace
Poole live here still?

01:06:38.161 --> 01:06:42.041
Yes, Grace Poole will stay.

01:06:42.207 --> 01:06:44.505
- After last night?
- Don't ask for explanations.

01:06:44.667 --> 01:06:47.671
Believe me when I tell you there
are reasons for it. Good reasons.

01:06:47.837 --> 01:06:49.805
You're my little friend,
Jane, aren't you?

01:06:50.173 --> 01:06:53.473
I like to serve you, sir,
in everything that's right.

01:06:53.635 --> 01:06:57.139
If I asked you to do something you
thought was wrong, what then?

01:06:57.347 --> 01:07:01.272
My little friend would turn to me,
very quiet and pale, and say:

01:07:01.559 --> 01:07:04.403
"Oh, no, sir, that's impossible."

01:07:05.146 --> 01:07:06.773
Am I right?

01:07:08.608 --> 01:07:13.455
Jane, I want you to use your fancy.

01:07:13.613 --> 01:07:14.990
Suppose yourself a boy...

01:07:15.156 --> 01:07:19.627
a thoughtless, impetuous boy
indulged from childhood upwards.

01:07:19.786 --> 01:07:22.255
Imagine yourself in some
remote foreign land.

01:07:22.872 --> 01:07:26.297
Conceive that you there
commit a capital error.

01:07:26.459 --> 01:07:29.804
One that cuts you off from the
possibility of all human joys.

01:07:30.004 --> 01:07:32.052
In your despair, you
wander about vainly...

01:07:32.215 --> 01:07:34.559
seeking contentment
in empty pleasure.

01:07:34.717 --> 01:07:38.392
Then suddenly...

01:07:38.555 --> 01:07:42.150
fate offers you the
chance of regeneration...

01:07:44.561 --> 01:07:46.404
and true happiness.

01:07:46.563 --> 01:07:50.909
Are you justified in overleaping
the obstacles of mere custom?

01:07:51.067 --> 01:07:54.617
Tell me, Jane, are you justified?

01:07:54.946 --> 01:07:56.823
How can I answer, sir?

01:07:56.990 --> 01:07:59.539
Every conscience must
come to its own decision.

01:07:59.742 --> 01:08:02.370
But it can't come to a decision.

01:08:02.537 --> 01:08:05.791
If you're afraid that you may bring
shame to what you most cherish...

01:08:05.957 --> 01:08:09.507
or destroy what you
most desire to protect.

01:08:10.295 --> 01:08:14.550
Oh, Jane, don't you curse me
for plaguing you like this?

01:08:14.716 --> 01:08:18.185
- Curse you? No, sir.
- Give me your assurance on that.

01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:23.899
Cold fingers. They were
warmer last night.

01:08:24.642 --> 01:08:29.022
Jane, will you watch with me again?

01:08:29.939 --> 01:08:31.816
Whenever I can be useful.

01:08:32.024 --> 01:08:35.450
For instance, the night
before I'm married.

01:08:36.069 --> 01:08:38.413
Will you sit with me then?

01:08:39.490 --> 01:08:41.959
- Are you going to be married, sir?
- Sometime. Why not?

01:08:42.118 --> 01:08:44.041
What makes you think
he's in the stable?

01:08:44.203 --> 01:08:46.171
You think no one will have me.
You're wrong.

01:08:46.331 --> 01:08:48.584
You don't know these
young ladies of fashion.

01:08:48.750 --> 01:08:54.348
They may not admire my person, but I
assure you, they dote on my purse.

01:08:54.505 --> 01:08:56.303
- Blanche.
- Good morning, Edward.

01:08:56.466 --> 01:08:58.719
By rights, I should scold you
for running off like this.

01:08:58.885 --> 01:09:01.684
- Mm-hm.
- A correct host entertains his guests.

01:09:01.845 --> 01:09:07.228
My dear Blanche, when will you learn?
I never was correct, nor ever shall be.

01:09:13.399 --> 01:09:14.524
Very pretty, partner.

01:09:14.692 --> 01:09:16.160
- Splendid.
- Thank you.

01:09:16.319 --> 01:09:18.412
Edward, I'm so glad you've
made up your mind...

01:09:18.571 --> 01:09:20.243
to come to London with us tomorrow.

01:09:20.406 --> 01:09:23.125
- Have I? I didn't know.
- Of course, how very appropriate.

01:09:23.283 --> 01:09:27.130
- What now, Edward?
- Put the red ball in the top pocket.

01:09:27.287 --> 01:09:29.006
Edward, does that person want you?

01:09:29.165 --> 01:09:31.587
I'm sorry, sir, I did not
know you were occupied.

01:09:31.751 --> 01:09:36.678
Very good, Miss Eyre. I'm sure
the ladies will excuse me.

01:09:42.178 --> 01:09:43.725
Governesses, Mama.

01:09:44.138 --> 01:09:46.937
I'm sorry, but I understood you
were leaving in the morning...

01:09:47.100 --> 01:09:49.273
and I wished to ask
you for a reference.

01:09:49.435 --> 01:09:52.439
Reference? What the deuce do
you want a reference for? Heh.

01:09:52.604 --> 01:09:54.949
- To get a new place, sir.
- Hmm.

01:09:56.150 --> 01:09:58.699
You as good as told me that
you were going to be married.

01:09:58.861 --> 01:10:00.534
Yes, what then?

01:10:00.697 --> 01:10:02.665
In which case, Adele
ought to go to school.

01:10:02.865 --> 01:10:04.538
To get her out of my bride's way...

01:10:04.701 --> 01:10:08.922
who otherwise might walk over her
rather too emphatically? Heh.

01:10:09.414 --> 01:10:11.166
Some sense in your
suggestion, Jane.

01:10:11.374 --> 01:10:15.845
Adele, as you say, must go to school.
And you must go to the devil, is that it?

01:10:16.003 --> 01:10:19.849
I hope not, sir. Unless it's the devil
who answers my advertisement.

01:10:20.007 --> 01:10:22.305
Advertisement? You mean
you've been advertising?

01:10:22.468 --> 01:10:25.392
- Not yet, sir, but I shall.
- You'll do nothing of the kind.

01:10:25.930 --> 01:10:28.854
Time comes for you to get a new
situation, I'll get one for you.

01:10:29.016 --> 01:10:30.438
Do you hear?

01:10:30.601 --> 01:10:33.229
Very well, sir.
Goodbye, Mr. Rochester.

01:10:33.438 --> 01:10:35.611
Goodbye, Miss Eyre.

01:10:36.023 --> 01:10:37.946
Jane.

01:10:38.860 --> 01:10:40.237
Is that all?

01:10:40.445 --> 01:10:45.497
Seems stingy to my notion.
Dry and unfriendly.

01:10:45.658 --> 01:10:47.877
Won't you do more than
just say goodbye?

01:10:48.035 --> 01:10:49.753
Well, I'll...

01:10:50.246 --> 01:10:52.465
I'll shake hands, sir.

01:10:52.915 --> 01:10:54.917
Oh, you'll shake hands?

01:11:08.055 --> 01:11:09.853
Goodbye, Jane.

01:11:30.912 --> 01:11:33.085
It is a beautiful
place, your Thornfield.

01:11:33.247 --> 01:11:35.420
Well, as a dungeon,
it serves its purpose.

01:11:35.583 --> 01:11:38.052
- Dungeon? Why, it's a paradise.
- Huh.

01:11:38.211 --> 01:11:40.213
Though, of course,
if one lived here...

01:11:40.379 --> 01:11:43.053
one would have to have a house
in London, wouldn't one?

01:11:43.216 --> 01:11:45.264
Unquestionably. A little
apartment in Paris...

01:11:45.426 --> 01:11:48.851
- ...perhaps a villa on the Mediterranean.
- How delightful that would be.

01:11:49.013 --> 01:11:52.517
But Thornfield would always be
there as a retreat from the world.

01:11:52.683 --> 01:11:55.812
A green haven of peace and love.

01:11:55.978 --> 01:11:59.983
Love? Who's talking of love? All a
fellow needs is a bit of distraction.

01:12:00.149 --> 01:12:03.323
A houseful of beautiful women to
keep him from brooding on his woes.

01:12:03.486 --> 01:12:05.739
Peering too closely into
mysteries of his heart, heh.

01:12:05.905 --> 01:12:07.305
- That is, if he has a heart.
- Hmm.

01:12:07.406 --> 01:12:09.875
And sometimes I wonder, Edward,
if you really have one.

01:12:10.034 --> 01:12:12.412
Have I ever done anything
to make you believe I have?

01:12:12.578 --> 01:12:14.956
- If so, it was unintentional.
- Are you never serious?

01:12:15.122 --> 01:12:17.921
Never more than at this moment,
except when I'm eating dinner.

01:12:18.084 --> 01:12:19.882
You can be revoltingly
coarse at times.

01:12:20.044 --> 01:12:23.423
- Can I ever be anything else?
- Can you?

01:12:23.965 --> 01:12:25.808
Would I have come if you couldn't?

01:12:26.008 --> 01:12:28.602
Heh, that's a very nice point.
Would you or would you not?

01:12:28.761 --> 01:12:31.935
Let's begin by considering the
significant facts of the case first.

01:12:32.098 --> 01:12:35.318
Mr. Rochester is revoltingly
coarse and as ugly as sin.

01:12:35.476 --> 01:12:36.853
- Edward!
- Allow me, my dear.

01:12:37.019 --> 01:12:38.441
I repeat, as ugly as sin.

01:12:38.604 --> 01:12:41.949
Secondly, he flirts, but is careful
never to talk about love or marriage.

01:12:42.108 --> 01:12:45.112
However... This is the third point.
...Lady Ingram is impoverished...

01:12:45.278 --> 01:12:49.283
whereas the revolting Mr. Rochester
has an assured income of 8000 a year.

01:12:49.448 --> 01:12:51.621
Now, in view of all this,
what is the attitude...

01:12:51.784 --> 01:12:53.786
that Miss Blanche may
be expected to take?

01:12:53.953 --> 01:12:57.457
From my experience, I'd surmise that
she'd ignore the coarseness, et cetera...

01:12:57.623 --> 01:12:59.466
- ...till Mr. R is hooked.
- How dare you...

01:12:59.625 --> 01:13:02.469
- No, no. No horseplay.
- I've never been so insulted in my life.

01:13:02.628 --> 01:13:05.632
Insulted? I merely paid the compliment
of being completely honest.

01:13:05.798 --> 01:13:08.847
Mr. Rochester, you are
a boor and a cur.

01:13:29.071 --> 01:13:31.324
I thought you'd gone.

01:13:35.244 --> 01:13:39.169
I changed my mind. Or rather, the
Ingram family changed theirs.

01:13:41.042 --> 01:13:42.089
Why are you crying?

01:13:46.547 --> 01:13:49.141
I was thinking about having
to leave Thornfield.

01:13:49.342 --> 01:13:52.562
You've become quite attached to
that foolish little Adele, haven't you?

01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:54.222
- To that simple old Fairfax.
- Yes.

01:13:54.388 --> 01:13:56.516
- You'd be sorry to part with them?
- Yes, sir.

01:13:56.682 --> 01:13:58.309
It's always the way in this life.

01:13:58.476 --> 01:14:01.696
No sooner have you got settled in a
pleasant place, you're to move on.

01:14:01.854 --> 01:14:04.107
I told you, I shall be ready
when the order comes.

01:14:04.273 --> 01:14:05.946
It's come now.

01:14:06.609 --> 01:14:08.611
Then it's settled?

01:14:08.778 --> 01:14:11.998
All settled. Even about
your future situation.

01:14:12.156 --> 01:14:13.829
You've found a place for me?

01:14:14.033 --> 01:14:17.583
Yes, Jane, I have.
In the west of Ireland.

01:14:17.745 --> 01:14:20.874
You'll like Ireland, I think. They're
such warm-hearted people there.

01:14:21.958 --> 01:14:25.132
- It's a long way off, sir.
- From what, Jane?

01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:31.225
From England and from Thornfield.

01:14:36.430 --> 01:14:37.977
Well...

01:14:39.141 --> 01:14:40.484
And from you, sir.

01:14:41.268 --> 01:14:43.942
Yes, Jane, it's a long way.

01:14:44.355 --> 01:14:46.904
When you get there, I shall
probably never see you again.

01:14:47.066 --> 01:14:49.740
We've been good friends,
Jane, haven't we?

01:14:51.779 --> 01:14:55.955
- Yes, sir.
- Even good friends may be forced to part.

01:15:02.498 --> 01:15:06.093
Let's make the most of
what time has left us.

01:15:06.252 --> 01:15:08.346
Let us sit here in peace.

01:15:09.922 --> 01:15:13.426
Even though we should be destined
never to sit here again.

01:15:18.264 --> 01:15:22.144
Sometimes I have a queer feeling
with regard to you, Jane.

01:15:22.351 --> 01:15:25.525
Especially when you
are near me, as now.

01:15:25.730 --> 01:15:31.453
It's as if I had a string
somewhere under my left rib.

01:15:31.610 --> 01:15:35.706
Tightly and inextricably knotted
to a similar string situated...

01:15:35.865 --> 01:15:38.618
in a corresponding corner
of your little frame.

01:15:39.118 --> 01:15:41.962
And if we should
have to be parted...

01:15:42.580 --> 01:15:45.208
that cord of communion
would be snapped...

01:15:47.668 --> 01:15:52.799
and I have the nervous notion
I should take to bleeding inwardly.

01:15:55.885 --> 01:15:57.637
As for you, you'd forget me.

01:15:58.554 --> 01:16:01.979
That I never will, sir.
You know that.

01:16:02.141 --> 01:16:06.897
I see the necessity of going, but it's
like looking on the necessity of death.

01:16:07.104 --> 01:16:08.856
Where do you see that necessity?

01:16:11.984 --> 01:16:15.739
- In your bride.
- What bride? I have no bride.

01:16:16.530 --> 01:16:22.378
- But you will have.
- Yes, I will. I will.

01:16:23.537 --> 01:16:26.837
Do you think I could stay here
to become nothing to you?

01:16:26.999 --> 01:16:29.969
Do you think because I'm poor
and obscure and plain...

01:16:30.169 --> 01:16:32.092
that I'm soulless and heartless?

01:16:32.546 --> 01:16:35.720
I have as much soul as you,
and fully as much heart.

01:16:37.259 --> 01:16:40.479
And if God had gifted me
with wealth and beauty...

01:16:40.638 --> 01:16:45.439
I should've made it as hard
for you to leave me as...

01:16:45.935 --> 01:16:48.688
As it is now for me to leave you.

01:16:49.897 --> 01:16:51.820
There, I've spoken my
heart, now let me go.

01:16:51.982 --> 01:16:53.404
Jane.

01:16:53.567 --> 01:16:59.119
Jane, you strange,
almost unearthly thing.

01:16:59.281 --> 01:17:02.410
- You, that I love as my own flesh.
- Don't mock me.

01:17:02.576 --> 01:17:06.171
I have no love for Blanche. It's you
I want. Answer me, Jane, quickly.

01:17:07.039 --> 01:17:09.588
Say, "Edward, I'll marry you."
Say it, Jane. Say it.

01:17:09.750 --> 01:17:11.627
- I want to read your face.
- Read quickly.

01:17:11.794 --> 01:17:13.137
Say, "Edward, I'll marry you."

01:17:16.423 --> 01:17:17.675
Edward, I'll marry you.

01:17:18.926 --> 01:17:20.599
God pardon me.

01:17:31.020 --> 01:17:34.680
<i>All my doubts, and all the grim
shadows that hung over Thornfield</i>

01:17:34.681 --> 01:17:38.922
<i>seemed to vanish... shattered
like the riven chestnut-tree.</i>

01:17:39.429 --> 01:17:41.710
<i>I loved and I was loved.</i>

01:17:42.020 --> 01:17:45.410
<i>Every sun-lit hour I looked
forward to love's fulfillment.</i>

01:17:45.411 --> 01:17:47.834
Jane, what do you
think you're doing?

01:17:47.997 --> 01:17:49.044
Teaching Adele, as usual.

01:17:49.206 --> 01:17:50.958
As usual as a new heaven
and a new Earth...

01:17:51.125 --> 01:17:52.968
and you go on teaching
Adele as usual.

01:17:53.127 --> 01:17:54.174
What is wrong with that?

01:17:54.336 --> 01:17:57.761
Because I'm going to marry mademoiselle
and take mademoiselle to the moon...

01:17:57.923 --> 01:18:01.973
and find a cave and mademoiselle will
live with us there forever. You approve?

01:18:02.136 --> 01:18:05.811
Monsieur, there's no one I'd rather
you marry. Not even Mrs. Fairfax.

01:18:05.973 --> 01:18:08.692
And some of that. And a
length of the scarlet.

01:18:08.851 --> 01:18:12.446
And a length of the scarlet,
and some of the gold silk.

01:18:12.605 --> 01:18:16.030
Here you are, milady, half a guinea
each way. That's 55 and a tenner.

01:18:16.192 --> 01:18:17.694
Tell your fortune, milord?

01:18:17.860 --> 01:18:20.158
- Go away!
- Let me read the pretty lady's future.

01:18:20.321 --> 01:18:24.042
The pretty lady's going to marry me.
We shall make our future ourselves.

01:18:45.679 --> 01:18:47.898
I require and charge ye both...

01:18:48.057 --> 01:18:50.810
as ye will answer at the
dreadful day of judgment...

01:18:50.976 --> 01:18:53.775
when the secrets of all
hearts shall be disclosed...

01:18:53.938 --> 01:18:56.532
that if either of you
know any impediment...

01:18:56.690 --> 01:18:59.819
why you may not lawfully
be joined in matrimony...

01:18:59.985 --> 01:19:02.113
ye do now confess it.

01:19:02.279 --> 01:19:07.035
For be ye well assured that if any
persons are joined together otherwise...

01:19:07.201 --> 01:19:12.332
then as the word of God doth allow,
then are they not joined by God...

01:19:12.498 --> 01:19:15.627
nor is their matrimony lawful.

01:19:15.793 --> 01:19:21.220
Edward Rochester, wilt thou have
this woman to be thy wedded wife?

01:19:21.382 --> 01:19:27.105
One moment, please. I declare
the existence of an impediment.

01:19:27.263 --> 01:19:31.268
- Proceed with the ceremony.
- You cannot proceed.

01:19:31.934 --> 01:19:34.107
Mr. Rochester has a
wife now living.

01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:39.071
- Who are you?
- My name's Briggs. I'm an attorney.

01:19:39.233 --> 01:19:43.363
Mr. Mason, on the 20th
of October, 1824...

01:19:43.529 --> 01:19:46.749
Edward Rochester of Thornfield Hall
was married to Bertha Mason...

01:19:46.907 --> 01:19:49.205
at St. Mary's Church,
Spanish Town, Jamaica.

01:19:49.368 --> 01:19:52.622
The record of the marriage will be
found in the register of that church.

01:19:52.788 --> 01:19:54.290
It's true, it's true! I swear it.

01:19:54.456 --> 01:19:56.959
She's living at Thornfield.
I've seen her there myself.

01:19:57.126 --> 01:19:58.594
I'm her brother.

01:20:02.339 --> 01:20:05.639
Parson, close your book.
There'll be no wedding today.

01:20:07.136 --> 01:20:11.983
Instead, I invite you all to my house
to meet Grace Poole's patient...

01:20:13.392 --> 01:20:15.235
my wife.

01:20:23.235 --> 01:20:26.114
To the right about,
every one of you!

01:20:26.530 --> 01:20:31.878
Away with your congratulations.
They are 15 years too late.

01:21:00.898 --> 01:21:03.742
That, gentlemen, is my wife.

01:21:03.901 --> 01:21:07.451
Mad, and the offspring
of a mad family...

01:21:07.946 --> 01:21:12.122
to whom the church and law bind me
forever, without hope of divorce.

01:21:12.659 --> 01:21:14.411
And this is what I wish to have.

01:21:14.995 --> 01:21:20.502
This young girl who stands so grave
and quiet at the mouth of hell.

01:21:20.709 --> 01:21:25.556
Look at the difference
and then judge me.

01:22:29.445 --> 01:22:30.992
Jane.

01:22:33.157 --> 01:22:36.286
Jane, I did not even know her.

01:22:36.618 --> 01:22:42.716
I was married at 19 in Spanish Town
to a bride already courted for me.

01:22:43.750 --> 01:22:48.756
But I married her, gross, groveling,
mole-eyed blockhead that I was.

01:22:48.922 --> 01:22:50.890
Jane, hear me.

01:22:51.049 --> 01:22:53.643
I suffered all the agonies
of a man bound to a wife...

01:22:53.802 --> 01:22:58.228
at once intemperate and unchaste.

01:22:59.224 --> 01:23:03.775
I watched her excesses drive
her at last into madness.

01:23:04.354 --> 01:23:07.233
Then I brought her back
to England, to Thornfield.

01:23:07.399 --> 01:23:10.824
Jane, I did everything that
God and humanity demanded.

01:23:11.612 --> 01:23:12.864
Then I fled from this place.

01:23:13.030 --> 01:23:15.453
My fixed desire was to
find a woman I could love.

01:23:15.616 --> 01:23:19.666
A contrast to the Fury I left here.
And what did I find?

01:23:19.828 --> 01:23:22.297
A French dancing girl,
a Viennese milliner...

01:23:22.456 --> 01:23:25.756
a Neapolitan countess
with a taste for jewelry.

01:23:26.418 --> 01:23:31.424
Back to England I rode again,
in sight of Thornfield.

01:23:32.758 --> 01:23:34.931
Someone was walking
there in the moonlight.

01:23:35.135 --> 01:23:37.934
A strange little
elfin-like creature.

01:23:38.096 --> 01:23:43.102
It frightened my horse and then came
up and gravely offered me help.

01:23:43.268 --> 01:23:48.650
I was to be aided, and by
that hand. And aided I was.

01:23:48.815 --> 01:23:52.661
And then later that evening...
Do you remember, Jane?

01:23:52.819 --> 01:23:55.493
- Say you remember.
- I remember.

01:23:55.656 --> 01:24:01.254
...you came into that room.
How shy you were.

01:24:01.870 --> 01:24:06.467
And yet how readily and roundly
you answered my questions.

01:24:07.125 --> 01:24:09.127
And then you smiled at me.

01:24:11.797 --> 01:24:14.425
That moment, I knew I'd found you.

01:24:14.758 --> 01:24:18.638
- Jane, can you not forgive me?
- I do forgive you.

01:24:19.471 --> 01:24:20.939
And you still love me?

01:24:22.516 --> 01:24:27.522
I do love you, with all my heart. I can
say it now, since it's for the last time.

01:24:27.729 --> 01:24:31.609
Do you mean to go one way in the
world and let me go another?

01:24:31.775 --> 01:24:34.824
Stay with me, Jane.
We'd be hurting nobody.

01:24:35.612 --> 01:24:37.285
We should be hurting ourselves.

01:24:38.156 --> 01:24:41.126
Would it be so wicked to
love me? Would it?

01:24:42.494 --> 01:24:45.998
I could crush you
between my hands...

01:24:47.749 --> 01:24:51.003
but your spirit would
still be free.

01:24:57.509 --> 01:25:00.058
Jane, you are going?

01:25:00.220 --> 01:25:02.268
I am going, sir.

01:25:02.431 --> 01:25:06.402
You will not be my comforter?
My rescuer?

01:25:07.853 --> 01:25:12.484
My deep love? My frantic prayer?

01:25:14.026 --> 01:25:16.154
Are they nothing to you?

01:25:18.196 --> 01:25:22.201
God bless you, my dear master.
God keep you from harm and wrong.

01:25:22.367 --> 01:25:24.210
Jane.

01:25:24.369 --> 01:25:27.794
Jane. Jane.

01:25:29.960 --> 01:25:32.709
<i>Going nowhere, I had nowhere to go.</i>

01:25:33.110 --> 01:25:35.771
<i>Without references, I could
not find employment.</i>

01:25:35.772 --> 01:25:38.375
<i>I knew hunger and
unsheltered nights.</i>

01:25:38.976 --> 01:25:43.768
<i>At last old memories, rather than my
will, drew me back to Gateshead Hall...</i>

01:25:43.769 --> 01:25:46.559
<i>to Bessie, who had
once been kind to me.</i>

01:26:02.866 --> 01:26:05.836
- Bessie.
- Yes, I'm Bessie.

01:26:06.078 --> 01:26:10.754
If you're looking for work, we haven't
got no work for no one nowadays.

01:26:10.916 --> 01:26:14.921
You look poorly, lass. If you're cold,
you're welcome to sit by the fire.

01:26:29.851 --> 01:26:31.603
Sit down, lass.

01:26:40.153 --> 01:26:43.453
Uh, where'd you get that brooch?

01:26:44.658 --> 01:26:46.001
You gave it to me, Bessie.

01:26:47.077 --> 01:26:49.546
Jane. Jane Eyre.

01:26:49.705 --> 01:26:52.299
A grown young lady, and you
were such a tiny thing...

01:26:52.457 --> 01:26:54.880
no higher than a broomstick.
Oh, Miss Jane.

01:26:56.336 --> 01:26:57.588
That's your poor aunt.

01:26:57.754 --> 01:27:00.883
Don't tell Aunt Reed I'm here,
or cousin John, or anyone.

01:27:01.049 --> 01:27:03.643
Master John isn't here anymore.

01:27:03.802 --> 01:27:05.975
As soon as he was of age,
he was off to London.

01:27:06.138 --> 01:27:07.481
Gambling, that's what it was.

01:27:07.639 --> 01:27:10.267
Thousands and thousands of
pounds the missus paid for him.

01:27:10.434 --> 01:27:13.358
She had to shut up most of the
house and turn off other servants.

01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:16.148
But still he kept
plaguing her for money.

01:27:16.314 --> 01:27:21.411
Then last summer he killed
himself, Miss Jane.

01:27:21.570 --> 01:27:23.038
Found him hanging in his room...

01:27:23.196 --> 01:27:25.790
and the cards still on the
table where they'd played.

01:27:25.949 --> 01:27:29.044
When they told the missus,
she had a kind of stroke.

01:27:29.202 --> 01:27:30.875
Wandering-like, in her mind.

01:27:40.130 --> 01:27:42.508
- Is that you, Bessie?
- Yes, ma'am.

01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:51.809
Who are you? Go away.

01:27:52.684 --> 01:27:55.813
I'm Jane, Aunt Reed. Jane Eyre.

01:27:57.189 --> 01:28:00.534
Jane Eyre.

01:28:04.571 --> 01:28:08.701
Nobody could know the trouble
I've had with that child.

01:28:09.451 --> 01:28:15.458
A little pauper brat that
should've been in the workhouse.

01:28:24.341 --> 01:28:25.718
Jane.

01:28:25.967 --> 01:28:27.890
Jane Eyre.

01:28:29.346 --> 01:28:30.893
Oh.

01:28:31.056 --> 01:28:36.062
Oh, don't leave me, Jane.
Please don't leave me.

01:28:40.106 --> 01:28:41.358
I won't leave you.

01:28:57.749 --> 01:29:00.430
No, sir, missus can't see nobody.
She's been ill for months.

01:29:00.585 --> 01:29:01.632
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:29:01.795 --> 01:29:04.355
I wanted to make some inquiries
about a niece of hers, Miss Eyre.

01:29:04.506 --> 01:29:07.726
- Would you wait inside a moment, sir?
- Thank you.

01:29:08.677 --> 01:29:10.270
Thank you.

01:29:14.266 --> 01:29:16.519
- A gentleman to see you.
- I don't want to see him.

01:29:16.685 --> 01:29:18.858
- I don't want to see anyone.
- Don't be foolish.

01:29:19.020 --> 01:29:22.274
You can't live alone like the man
in the moon. I'll sit with the missus.

01:29:22.440 --> 01:29:24.408
Run along, now. He's waiting.

01:29:34.286 --> 01:29:36.755
- Jane.
- How did you know I was here?

01:29:36.955 --> 01:29:39.424
I didn't. I was trying to find you.

01:29:39.583 --> 01:29:41.881
I received an inquiry
about you the other day.

01:29:43.795 --> 01:29:48.517
You didn't stay in that place you went to
very long, did you? Didn't you like it?

01:29:48.675 --> 01:29:50.552
What happened?

01:29:51.428 --> 01:29:52.600
I had to leave.

01:29:53.847 --> 01:29:56.316
Forgive me.
It's no business of mine.

01:29:56.474 --> 01:29:59.444
All the same, I do feel obliged
to ask you about this letter.

01:29:59.644 --> 01:30:01.396
It comes from a lawyer in Millcote.

01:30:01.563 --> 01:30:04.112
Writes to me as the person
who you gave as reference...

01:30:04.274 --> 01:30:07.653
when you went to Thornfield.
That's near Millcote, isn't it?

01:30:07.819 --> 01:30:10.538
A client of his wants to
know your whereabouts.

01:30:10.864 --> 01:30:12.491
You know who's inquiring for you?

01:30:15.160 --> 01:30:18.164
Jane, if you don't want me to
talk about this anymore, I won't.

01:30:19.998 --> 01:30:22.842
- Thank you, Dr. Rivers.
- It's for you to say.

01:30:25.670 --> 01:30:28.514
Or would you rather
I didn't answer it at all?

01:30:51.905 --> 01:30:54.704
That's much better.
Thank you very much, sir.

01:30:54.866 --> 01:30:59.042
Thirty shillings. Thirty-five bob.
Anyone for 35? Two pounds his bid.

01:30:59.204 --> 01:31:03.254
Going at £2. Going, going.
Take it away, Bill.

01:31:48.420 --> 01:31:50.218
<i>Jane.</i>

01:31:52.424 --> 01:31:53.767
<i>Jane.</i>

01:31:54.676 --> 01:31:55.973
<i>Jane.</i>

01:32:02.600 --> 01:32:06.868
<i>It seemed to cry of a soul in pain,
and appeal so wild and urgent</i>

01:32:06.869 --> 01:32:09.418
<i>that I knew I must go,
and go quickly.</i>

01:32:09.919 --> 01:32:12.259
<i>Only when I knew what
had happened to him...</i>

01:32:12.460 --> 01:32:17.077
<i>only when I had looked once more upon that
tortured face... could I make my decision.</i>

01:32:19.576 --> 01:32:21.920
It was she who did it, Miss Eyre.

01:32:22.078 --> 01:32:24.797
She struck down Grace
Poole as she slept.

01:32:24.956 --> 01:32:28.130
And then she set
fire to Thornfield.

01:32:28.293 --> 01:32:31.888
It was her laugh in the
gallery that woke me.

01:32:32.505 --> 01:32:37.136
I ran into the nursery and wrapped
Adele in a shawl and carried her down.

01:32:37.302 --> 01:32:42.479
And as we came out into the
courtyard, I heard her laugh again.

01:32:43.308 --> 01:32:46.187
I looked up, and there
she was on the roof...

01:32:46.352 --> 01:32:50.107
laughing and waving her
arms above the battlements.

01:32:50.315 --> 01:32:52.864
Mr. Edward saw her as he came out.

01:32:53.026 --> 01:32:54.278
He did not say anything...

01:32:54.444 --> 01:32:57.664
but went straight back into
the house to try to save her.

01:32:57.822 --> 01:33:01.201
All this side of the
house was blazing.

01:33:01.367 --> 01:33:05.668
There was smoke everywhere.
Then it cleared.

01:33:05.830 --> 01:33:09.130
And suddenly we saw Mr. Edward
behind her on the battlements.

01:33:09.834 --> 01:33:14.135
She saw him too. He came
towards her to help her down.

01:33:15.256 --> 01:33:17.805
She stood very still for a moment.

01:33:17.967 --> 01:33:22.017
And just as he seemed to reach her,
she gave a dreadful scream...

01:33:22.180 --> 01:33:24.433
and ran from him to the edge.

01:33:25.642 --> 01:33:29.943
The next moment, she lay smashed
on the pavement before us.

01:33:30.438 --> 01:33:31.940
She was dead, Miss Eyre.

01:33:37.028 --> 01:33:38.701
Mr. Edward?

01:33:38.863 --> 01:33:42.538
The great staircase fell
in as he was coming down.

01:34:03.388 --> 01:34:06.267
- Mrs. Fairfax?
- Yes, sir?

01:34:06.432 --> 01:34:09.026
What the deuce are you doing
in this part of the house?

01:34:09.894 --> 01:34:13.114
- Adele is waiting for her supper.
- Yes, sir.

01:34:19.320 --> 01:34:21.448
Here, Pilot.

01:34:27.078 --> 01:34:28.830
Who's there?

01:34:30.832 --> 01:34:32.755
Who are you?

01:34:34.043 --> 01:34:35.420
I've come back, sir.

01:34:44.053 --> 01:34:45.600
Edward. Edward.

01:34:46.306 --> 01:34:49.606
Her very fingers, huh?

01:34:49.767 --> 01:34:52.737
Her small, soft fingers.

01:34:55.273 --> 01:34:57.116
Her hair.

01:35:00.153 --> 01:35:03.498
Her little flower-soft face.

01:35:03.656 --> 01:35:06.956
- And her heart too, Edward.
- Jane.

01:35:09.078 --> 01:35:11.752
All you can feel now is mere pity.

01:35:13.458 --> 01:35:17.133
- I don't want your pity.
- Edward.

01:35:20.006 --> 01:35:22.850
You can't spend your life with
a mere wreckage of a man.

01:35:23.718 --> 01:35:26.722
You're young and fresh.
You ought to get married.

01:35:26.888 --> 01:35:30.893
Don't send me away. Please
don't send me away.

01:35:32.977 --> 01:35:34.820
You think I want to let you go?

01:35:39.150 --> 01:35:40.902
Jane.

01:35:45.949 --> 01:35:49.328
<i>As the months went past, he came
to see the light once more...</i>

01:35:49.494 --> 01:35:51.622
<i>as well as to feel its warmth.</i>

01:35:51.788 --> 01:35:56.385
<i>To see first the glory of the sun and
then the mild splendor of the moon...</i>

01:35:56.542 --> 01:35:59.341
<i>and at last the evening star.</i>

01:35:59.504 --> 01:36:03.134
<i>And then one day, when our
first-born was put into his arms...</i>

01:36:03.299 --> 01:36:07.520
<i>he could see that the boy had inherited
his own eyes as they once were.</i>

01:36:07.679 --> 01:36:10.649
<i>Large, brilliant and black.</i>
