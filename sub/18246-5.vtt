00:18.120 --> 00:19.800
<i>The Inbetweeners 1x5
Caravan Club</i>

00:22.527 --> 00:25.159
<i>Hi, I'm Will, and as a special treat</i>

00:25.279 --> 00:28.094
<i>I now get to finish my A-Levels
at a State comprehensive.</i>

00:28.214 --> 00:29.199
Posh twat.

00:29.360 --> 00:31.719
<i>Everyone's made me feel very welcome.</i>

00:31.901 --> 00:33.159
Briefcase wanker.

00:33.338 --> 00:35.719
<i>- I have made some friends.
- Oh, friend!</i>

00:36.046 --> 00:38.039
<i>Unfortunately,
they're bigger losers than me...</i>

00:40.673 --> 00:43.341
<i>Which means, while other people
get to play pool and hang out,</i>

00:43.461 --> 00:47.279
<i>I spend my free periods tied to a chair
with a rubbish bin on my head.</i>

00:49.791 --> 00:50.977
What happened to you?

00:51.097 --> 00:52.797
- I tripped.
- Really?

00:52.917 --> 00:55.560
No, not really, Neil.
Donovan's tied me to a chair.

00:55.720 --> 00:57.799
He says no-one's allowed to touch me.
The prick.

00:57.962 --> 01:00.241
Just so you know,
he's stood 10 foot away.

01:00.361 --> 01:01.880
Shit. He didn't hear that, did he?

01:02.040 --> 01:03.218
Yep, he's heard that.

01:03.338 --> 01:06.344
- Come on, we'll get you out.
- Better not, Neil.

01:07.088 --> 01:09.438
Sorry, we're not allowed to untie you.

01:09.679 --> 01:10.679
Fair enough.

01:12.253 --> 01:14.799
- So what are we up to this weekend?
- We could go to Bluewater.

01:14.960 --> 01:17.999
A shopping centre?
Great. You know how much I love chavs.

01:18.160 --> 01:20.775
Bluewater's not chavvy.
It's quality. I go there all the time.

01:20.895 --> 01:21.961
I rest my case.

01:22.081 --> 01:23.844
To be fair, they've now got a Nando's.

01:23.964 --> 01:26.595
- The hallmark of quality!
- I actually like Nando's.

01:26.715 --> 01:30.320
Whatever you lot get up to this weekend,
I won't be there.

01:30.480 --> 01:32.439
Oh, no! Who will supply the witticisms.

01:32.600 --> 01:34.168
I'll be up to my nuts in some guts,

01:34.288 --> 01:36.159
shagging those two sisters
from Caravan Club.

01:36.279 --> 01:40.229
Camber Sands meeting this weekend,
which is always like a massive orgy.

01:40.529 --> 01:43.718
Except it's not, though, is it?
It's holidays for old people.

01:43.838 --> 01:45.754
I'm sorry, did someone say something?

01:45.874 --> 01:47.400
Was Bin Boy giving it the big 'un?

01:47.560 --> 01:49.621
It's funny how you never get
any girls around here,

01:49.741 --> 01:53.040
yet away on Caravan Club you're like
some sort of gypsy Russell Brand.

01:53.200 --> 01:55.730
I wouldn't shag any
of the skanky girls around here, mate.

01:55.850 --> 01:57.278
Except for your mum, obviously.

01:57.338 --> 01:58.841
- Get in the queue!
- Brilliant.

01:58.900 --> 02:01.249
If you don't believe me,
you should come down to Camber Sands.

02:01.323 --> 02:03.098
Even Bin Boy might get some sex!

02:03.218 --> 02:05.319
All right. I'm definitely up for that.

02:05.481 --> 02:06.611
Yeah, love to.

02:08.931 --> 02:10.264
You don't have to.

02:10.384 --> 02:12.532
If I have to sleep in a caravan
to prove you're lying,

02:12.652 --> 02:14.400
then I'm willing to make that sacrifice.

02:14.676 --> 02:16.198
Fine. Good.

02:16.968 --> 02:17.823
Come down.

02:17.943 --> 02:20.719
- Then we'll see who's lying.
- Yes, you. You're lying.

02:22.964 --> 02:25.322
- Mark, can we untie him now?
- No.

02:26.026 --> 02:27.679
Sorry, mate. See you at lunch.

02:27.840 --> 02:30.279
- See you then.
- Oh, shit, it's Gilbert.

02:30.441 --> 02:33.424
- Good, now Donovan's in trouble.
- Don't grass.

02:33.893 --> 02:36.768
Cooper, Sutherland, Cartwright,

02:37.040 --> 02:40.120
- and who have we under here?
- McKenzie, sir.

02:40.281 --> 02:42.931
Let me guess,
no-one saw how this happened.

02:43.121 --> 02:45.640
- I suppose you tripped.
- No, what happened was...

02:45.800 --> 02:47.681
Sorry, you're about to grass, are you?

02:47.801 --> 02:48.519
Sir?

02:48.681 --> 02:50.658
If there's one thing no-one likes,
it's a grass.

02:50.944 --> 02:53.879
So I will ask you how this happened
and you will reply, "I tripped."

02:54.231 --> 02:56.234
But, sir, if no-one reported crimes,

02:56.354 --> 02:59.200
- the justice system would collapse...
- I'll ask you again.

02:59.474 --> 03:01.042
How did this happen?

03:01.654 --> 03:02.599
I tripped.

03:03.463 --> 03:04.429
Clumsy.

03:07.223 --> 03:09.218
<i>Thanks to Gilbert's disdain
for informers,</i>

03:09.338 --> 03:11.426
<i>I was left tied to the chair
for the rest of the day.</i>

03:11.546 --> 03:12.250
Guys?

03:12.360 --> 03:14.657
<i>The one good thing is
we called Jay's bluff.</i>

03:14.777 --> 03:17.158
<i>This was the classic win-win situation.</i>

03:17.278 --> 03:20.328
<i>If by some miracle,
Caravan Club was full of girls,</i>

03:20.448 --> 03:21.780
<i>then we might get laid,</i>

03:21.900 --> 03:24.218
<i>but if it was full of weird old people
and chavs,</i>

03:24.338 --> 03:26.911
<i>which it would be,
then Jay would never live it down,</i>

03:27.031 --> 03:29.478
<i>so with high hopes, we hit the open road</i>

03:29.598 --> 03:31.679
<i>in Simon's shitty little yellow car.</i>

03:33.545 --> 03:35.466
How fast can this thing go,
then, do you reckon?

03:35.586 --> 03:38.457
It's the special edition,
so I reckon it could probably top a ton.

03:38.577 --> 03:40.502
- Bollocks.
- Easily could.

03:40.651 --> 03:42.220
It's a pretty good car.

03:42.340 --> 03:44.533
I thought your dad had forbidden you
from going over 50.

03:44.653 --> 03:47.034
- He's not here, is he?
- And it couldn't do it anyway.

03:47.154 --> 03:48.504
Right, we'll see.

03:54.160 --> 03:56.839
80's pretty good.
We could leave it there.

03:57.001 --> 03:59.399
- Go on, Si!
- Oh, my God, we're gonna die!

04:00.170 --> 04:01.799
Simon, if you survive and I don't,

04:01.961 --> 04:04.880
give this message to my mum.
"Simon killed me."

04:05.478 --> 04:07.540
My arms are hurting a bit now.

04:07.739 --> 04:08.440
98.

04:10.201 --> 04:10.906
99.

04:13.041 --> 04:15.397
100 miles an hour!

04:16.430 --> 04:17.918
- Thank Christ.
- Told you.

04:18.579 --> 04:19.985
Yeah, not too bad.

04:21.718 --> 04:23.068
Can you get that?

04:25.041 --> 04:26.176
It's from Jay.

04:27.405 --> 04:29.919
No idea what it says,
but I'm pretty sure it's not English.

04:30.088 --> 04:33.824
There's an I, then an H, then a V.

04:33.944 --> 04:35.180
Give it here.

04:37.088 --> 04:40.535
He says he wants us to pick him up
at the garage just outside Camber Sands

04:40.655 --> 04:42.879
and he'll show us
how to get to the caravan park.

04:43.091 --> 04:44.599
Thank you, Dr Doolittle.

04:45.218 --> 04:46.029
What?

04:47.340 --> 04:50.590
- Cos he talks to the animals.
- I'm not following you.

04:53.560 --> 04:55.999
And he's also buying a jumbo pack
of ribbed johnnies.

04:56.160 --> 04:58.129
Does anyone else need some?

05:01.916 --> 05:04.802
<i>Despite Simon's best efforts,
we made it to Camber Sands alive.</i>

05:04.922 --> 05:06.890
<i>We'd arranged to meet Jay
at the service station,</i>

05:07.010 --> 05:08.879
<i>and though Simon
could just about drive a car,</i>

05:08.999 --> 05:11.959
<i>getting petrol into it
still remained a mystery.</i>

05:19.779 --> 05:22.048
Christ, I forgot about this shit heap.

05:22.168 --> 05:24.223
I don't think even I could help you
get laid in that.

05:24.287 --> 05:25.921
Have you ever used one of these before?

05:26.041 --> 05:27.785
It's fucking broken. This should reach.

05:27.905 --> 05:29.848
Are you sure you actually passed
your test?

05:29.968 --> 05:32.115
How many times did you have
to suck off the instructor?!

05:32.235 --> 05:33.807
You want to park it a bit closer, Si.

05:33.927 --> 05:37.039
- Yeah, thanks, Neil.
- Pump number six, please park closer.

05:37.200 --> 05:38.919
- Told you.
- This is embarrassing.

05:39.153 --> 05:41.089
I'm gonna go check out the clunge mags.

05:41.209 --> 05:42.202
Wait for me.

05:42.322 --> 05:44.879
Pump number six, do you need assistance?

05:45.041 --> 05:48.016
I think I might go and stretch
my legs a bit, too.

05:54.600 --> 05:56.846
- What's so funny, then?
- It's your mum in this mag.

05:56.966 --> 05:58.338
Yes, very droll, well done.

05:58.458 --> 06:01.400
No, look,
it really looks like your mum's face.

06:02.579 --> 06:03.349
Yes.

06:05.397 --> 06:06.233
No!

06:06.353 --> 06:08.175
That is definitely your mum's snatch.

06:08.295 --> 06:10.723
I just got a text from this girl
at the Caravan Club.

06:10.843 --> 06:12.319
- Yeah, is it Becky?
- Yeah.

06:12.480 --> 06:14.146
I texted her your photo. What's she say?

06:14.266 --> 06:15.661
"Hi, Simon, my name's Becky.

06:15.781 --> 06:18.161
"Liked your photo.
Jay says you've got a cool car as well.

06:18.281 --> 06:19.633
"See you later. Smiley face."

06:19.753 --> 06:21.410
She's seen a picture of you.

06:21.530 --> 06:23.600
- Let's get back one of her.
- With her tits out.

06:23.760 --> 06:25.764
Might be a bit early
in the relationship for that.

06:25.884 --> 06:28.079
- She is filthy.
- Still a bit early, I reckon.

06:28.241 --> 06:29.286
What shall I write?

06:29.406 --> 06:31.223
"Spread 'em.
I'll be there in half an hour."

06:31.343 --> 06:33.520
Or, "So lovely to hear from you,

06:33.779 --> 06:35.477
"it would be a pleasure to meet up."

06:35.597 --> 06:38.029
- "PS, I'm a poofter."
- Don't put the PS.

06:38.279 --> 06:40.347
All right,
I've put, "Can't wait to meet up.

06:40.467 --> 06:42.099
"How will I know what you look like?"

06:42.219 --> 06:44.720
- Smiley face at the end?
- Smiley with a wink. It's cheeky.

06:44.880 --> 06:47.000
No, the winky face is the mark
of a moron.

06:47.281 --> 06:48.431
I've sent it.

07:00.330 --> 07:01.759
Is that Leona Lewis?

07:01.879 --> 07:03.737
It's a picture of her
with her sister Suzanne.

07:03.905 --> 07:05.512
- Are they kissing?
- Let me see.

07:05.632 --> 07:06.940
Please be lesbo.

07:07.403 --> 07:08.403
Fit enough.

07:08.746 --> 07:10.252
I told you there was fit birds,

07:10.372 --> 07:12.200
and there's plenty more
where they came from.

07:12.428 --> 07:14.239
I think I'm actually gonna get laid.

07:14.468 --> 07:17.200
Oh, my God, sisters! That's so horny!

07:17.361 --> 07:19.731
First rule of Caravan Club
is that everyone gets some.

07:19.851 --> 07:21.244
Second rule of Caravan Club is,

07:21.364 --> 07:23.698
don't tell anyone about the first rule,
cos it's a massive lie.

07:23.818 --> 07:26.778
- We'll see about that, won't we?
- Yes, we will.

07:28.280 --> 07:31.199
- Pump number six, please, and these.
- And them.

07:34.527 --> 07:36.415
Do you want a bag for these?

07:42.696 --> 07:46.477
<i>Admittedly Jay knew some girls,
but driving into the caravan park,</i>

07:46.597 --> 07:48.999
<i>it didn't look like the kind of place
you'd have an orgy.</i>

07:49.161 --> 07:51.983
<i>It looked like a field
with some old tents in it.</i>

07:54.093 --> 07:55.543
Welcome to my world.

07:56.141 --> 07:58.319
- Where are all these women, then?
- There's loads.

07:58.480 --> 08:00.248
- Just look around you.
- Where?

08:00.680 --> 08:02.598
Everywhere. What about her?

08:02.718 --> 08:05.786
- She's about 12, Jay.
- Nah, she's older than that.

08:05.906 --> 08:07.279
Believe me, Christ!

08:07.617 --> 08:09.807
What sort of camp have we come to?

08:10.000 --> 08:11.081
Here they come.

08:11.201 --> 08:13.039
- Becky, Suzanne.
- Hi, Jay.

08:13.576 --> 08:15.320
This is Simon I was telling you about.

08:15.480 --> 08:16.291
Hello.

08:16.411 --> 08:18.640
Thanks for your text. Nice car.

08:18.843 --> 08:21.600
Thanks. It's not actually from Hawaii,
it just says it on the back.

08:21.913 --> 08:24.639
I like it.
Are you guys coming to the party later?

08:24.919 --> 08:26.000
Yeah, definitely.

08:26.160 --> 08:28.392
Great, I'll see you later, then.

08:30.967 --> 08:32.917
That one has fucked everyone.

08:33.280 --> 08:35.164
I've slung one up her
a few times myself.

08:35.284 --> 08:37.429
And who exactly is everyone, Jay?

08:37.591 --> 08:40.438
That old man over there?
Has he had a go on her?

08:40.601 --> 08:42.722
I promise you that
when you go back from this place

08:42.842 --> 08:44.753
you'll be begging your parents
to buy a caravan.

08:44.873 --> 08:46.774
I'm not sure Neil's dad
could afford a caravan.

08:46.894 --> 08:49.397
If he thought of it as a mobile closet,
I'm sure he'd find the money.

08:49.517 --> 08:51.675
- My dad's not bent.
- We only have your word for that.

08:51.795 --> 08:54.639
- My dad's not bent.
- Yeah, you would say that, though.

08:54.800 --> 08:56.840
Jay. Dinner's ready.

08:57.188 --> 08:59.250
All right then, dickheads,
Mum's made you tea,

08:59.370 --> 09:01.788
so park up and I'll meet you
in the caravan.

09:01.908 --> 09:04.758
Tea in a caravan.
I've finally hit rock bottom.

09:07.457 --> 09:09.582
There you go, boys.

09:09.847 --> 09:12.160
Some lovely salad,

09:12.516 --> 09:14.286
to go with your sausages.

09:14.406 --> 09:17.281
- Thanks, Mrs Cartwright.
- It's my pleasure.

09:26.626 --> 09:28.719
This is really delicious,
Mrs Cartwright.

09:37.216 --> 09:38.508
Cool, crisps.

09:39.365 --> 09:41.158
Have you got any ketchup?

09:49.735 --> 09:52.647
- Jesus Christ.
- My eyes are burning.

09:52.893 --> 09:55.735
All right, boys? Are you coming
to the dance tonight, then?

09:55.855 --> 09:57.087
Yes, Mr Cartwright.

09:57.207 --> 09:58.798
I've lined Simon up with a girl, Dad.

09:58.918 --> 10:01.759
Finally someone's gonna take advantage
of all the birds down here!

10:01.921 --> 10:03.915
Jay's about as much use as a nun's tits.

10:04.035 --> 10:06.292
Leave him alone,
Terry, you're embarrassing him.

10:06.412 --> 10:09.079
- Delicious crisps, Mrs Cartwright.
- Thanks, Will.

10:09.520 --> 10:11.400
She opened the packet herself!

10:12.122 --> 10:13.987
Don't you boys just love it out here?

10:14.107 --> 10:16.538
Sense of freedom you don't get
with other holidays.

10:16.658 --> 10:19.689
Right, we'd best be getting ready, Dad.
Maybe see you later.

10:20.000 --> 10:23.440
I'll be there. Fighting the girls off
with a shitty stick!

10:23.743 --> 10:25.959
I don't think he'll need that stick.

10:26.121 --> 10:28.800
<i>Looking back, I should have realised
that Mr Cartwright's explosive bowels</i>

10:29.360 --> 10:30.983
<i>were a sign of things to come.</i>

10:32.197 --> 10:34.018
<i>So the big night was finally here.</i>

10:34.138 --> 10:36.826
<i>The Caravan Club disco
and all its delights of the flesh</i>

10:36.946 --> 10:39.573
<i>lay just inside a giant garden shed.</i>

10:52.202 --> 10:54.766
As predicted, this is shit.

10:54.886 --> 10:56.572
I drove all the way here for this?

10:56.761 --> 10:58.732
It's just getting started.
Give it a minute.

10:59.190 --> 11:00.533
Oh, tune!

11:11.140 --> 11:12.732
He's actually quite good.

11:13.571 --> 11:15.372
I'm gonna get some hummous.

11:19.213 --> 11:22.659
- Your ride for the evening is here.
- Do you really think she'll shag me?

11:22.779 --> 11:24.893
Course. Why else do you think
they come caravanning?

11:25.053 --> 11:25.853
Fresh air?

11:26.013 --> 11:28.372
That text was her way of telling you
it is on.

11:28.533 --> 11:30.151
Shit, amazing.

11:30.609 --> 11:33.578
I feel a bit weird, though, cos
I always thought I'd lose it with Carly.

11:33.698 --> 11:36.016
Listen to me,
that bird Becky's an animal.

11:36.136 --> 11:38.339
She'll fuck you till you're blind
and teach you all sorts.

11:38.459 --> 11:40.789
When Carly finds out,
she's going to be two things:

11:40.909 --> 11:44.293
jealous and wet,
because now she'll know you're a stud.

11:44.453 --> 11:46.228
- You really think so?
- Course.

11:46.348 --> 11:48.009
Carly doesn't really fancy you,

11:48.129 --> 11:49.878
so if you're waiting to lose it
with her,

11:49.998 --> 11:51.749
you're gonna be waiting
until you're dead.

11:51.869 --> 11:53.916
- I think she likes me a bit, though.
- She doesn't.

11:54.036 --> 11:55.293
She thinks you're a twat.

11:55.453 --> 11:57.093
Becky likes you,

11:57.253 --> 12:00.013
and she likes sex.
It's the perfect combination.

12:00.414 --> 12:04.333
- Just don't go for anal straightaway.
- OK. Thanks, man.

12:04.493 --> 12:06.966
No problem.
Look, here they come. Don't worry,

12:07.086 --> 12:10.050
I'll distract Fatty Boom Boom
with the buffet.

12:11.860 --> 12:15.299
<i>So, amazingly, it looked like
Simon might actually pull.</i>

12:15.571 --> 12:18.002
<i>If he could bring himself
to speak to her.</i>

12:18.271 --> 12:19.873
<i>As for the rest of us,</i>

12:20.138 --> 12:21.612
<i>I wasn't holding my breath.</i>

12:23.450 --> 12:26.333
I'd imagine it's a sense of freedom
you don't get with other holidays.

12:26.493 --> 12:29.454
- Can I get you some more hummous?
- Delicious, thank you very much.

12:29.574 --> 12:31.333
Why are you talking to the pensioners?

12:31.701 --> 12:35.293
- Just taking the piss.
- What, by eating hummous?

12:36.744 --> 12:39.515
Would you rather eat hummous
or take me somewhere quiet?

12:39.635 --> 12:42.132
I think I'd rather
take you somewhere quiet.

12:42.323 --> 12:43.773
Come over here then.

12:44.538 --> 12:46.328
Sorry, I didn't catch your name.

12:46.448 --> 12:48.972
I'm Will and I like hummous.
There, I've said it.

12:49.888 --> 12:51.396
Will, two things.

12:51.516 --> 12:53.704
For the next few hours,
I don't need you to be charming

12:53.824 --> 12:57.457
or sophisticated or even interesting.
I just need you to be willing.

12:57.577 --> 12:59.325
- Can you handle that?
- I think so.

12:59.445 --> 13:01.813
Good. And second, kiss me.

13:02.326 --> 13:03.153
Right.

13:03.693 --> 13:04.457
OK.

13:08.103 --> 13:10.189
- What are you doing?
- I just need a moment.

13:10.309 --> 13:12.450
I'm gonna take you outside
and I want you to fuck me.

13:12.570 --> 13:14.372
- Really?
- Yes, really.

13:14.534 --> 13:16.572
Hang on, we barely know each other.

13:16.733 --> 13:19.587
We should get to know each other first,
shouldn't we?

13:19.707 --> 13:21.831
Come on, we're young,

13:21.951 --> 13:25.767
let's have some fun and then
fall exhausted into each other's arms.

13:25.887 --> 13:27.092
I've got an idea.

13:27.325 --> 13:29.675
Did you ever used to skid as a child?

13:29.795 --> 13:31.240
I used to love it.

13:31.829 --> 13:32.757
Come on!

13:33.413 --> 13:34.333
Let's skid!

13:38.841 --> 13:41.613
Get your shoes off! It's liberating!

13:44.655 --> 13:45.970
Where are you going?

13:46.090 --> 13:47.572
- Don't you want to skid?
- No.

13:47.733 --> 13:51.252
- What about our lovemaking?
- Lovemaking? Gone off it, sorry.

13:57.414 --> 13:58.364
My shoes!

13:59.466 --> 14:01.016
Give me back my shoes!

14:04.794 --> 14:08.173
<i>Somehow, in three minutes
I'd gone from guaranteed sex</i>

14:08.293 --> 14:10.406
<i>to being bullied by eight-year-olds,</i>

14:10.532 --> 14:13.212
<i>and I'm still not entirely sure
how that happened.</i>

14:17.802 --> 14:20.233
- Thought you was coming to the party?
- I was.

14:20.353 --> 14:22.812
I popped my head in the door
and saw you chatting up some fat bird,

14:22.973 --> 14:25.474
- so I didn't want to cramp your style.
- I weren't chatting her up.

14:25.594 --> 14:27.892
I was keeping her busy
while Simon was talking to her mate.

14:28.053 --> 14:31.098
Don't be embarrassed.
If I was as bad with the ladies as you,

14:31.218 --> 14:33.842
I'd have moved on
to the fatties months ago.

14:33.962 --> 14:37.173
- Oh, hello, Mr Cartwright. Jay.
- All right, Will? You got any action?

14:37.717 --> 14:40.693
- Yeah, I pulled a girl, actually.
- Fuck off. No way.

14:40.993 --> 14:43.812
Where is she now, then?
Cleaning up her beaver for you?

14:44.738 --> 14:46.613
No. She went off.

14:46.773 --> 14:49.852
Plenty more fish in the sea.
Jay's harpooned himself a whale.

14:50.013 --> 14:52.879
Give it a rest, Dad.
I already told you, it's not like that.

14:52.999 --> 14:55.846
Yeah, and I told you not to be
so fussy and to get stuck in.

14:55.966 --> 14:58.221
You're more likely
to get somewhere with a fatso,

14:58.341 --> 15:00.221
cos they're grateful for the attention.

15:00.341 --> 15:02.191
Even from a loser like you.

15:03.014 --> 15:04.723
- Dad.
- They say any port in a storm,

15:04.843 --> 15:06.732
and she was the size of a fucking port!

15:07.192 --> 15:08.453
I know what you're up to.

15:08.613 --> 15:11.598
You think, cos she's so massive,
she'll count as two shags.

15:11.718 --> 15:13.068
Well, she doesn't!

15:14.847 --> 15:17.286
- I get plenty of girls.
- No, you bloody don't.

15:17.406 --> 15:20.133
And even if you did,
what could you do with that thing?

15:20.253 --> 15:22.161
- It's like a McDonald's chip!
- Dad.

15:22.281 --> 15:24.884
You definitely take after your mum
in the cock-size department.

15:25.004 --> 15:28.532
- She ain't got one either!
- Can you just leave me alone for once?

15:30.132 --> 15:31.333
All right, all right.

15:31.493 --> 15:33.044
Bloody hell, he's just like his mum.

15:33.164 --> 15:35.012
Make one little joke
and he has a shit fit!

15:35.173 --> 15:36.013
Fuck this.

15:41.478 --> 15:43.651
Are these the only toilets, then?

15:48.333 --> 15:49.214
Oh, God.

15:49.334 --> 15:52.453
I'd give trap number two a couple
of minutes. I had eggs for lunch.

16:24.973 --> 16:27.412
- Shall we go outside, then?
- Yeah, all right.

16:30.797 --> 16:32.001
Fucking hell!

16:32.341 --> 16:33.773
Is this really happening?

16:34.467 --> 16:36.053
I'm gonna have sex, aren't I?!

16:36.213 --> 16:38.852
At last. Thanks for sorting this, Jay.

16:39.527 --> 16:43.250
- Fill this up for me.
- Thanks so much, mate. Nice one.

16:50.636 --> 16:51.516
Gotcha!

17:00.906 --> 17:03.572
Mr Cartwright,
you seem to be splashing me a bit.

17:03.877 --> 17:06.661
- Who stole your shoes?
- Just some kids.

17:06.781 --> 17:09.131
Kids? You let them get away with that?

17:09.406 --> 17:11.453
Laughing at you while
you're standing in your piss?

17:11.613 --> 17:13.492
I think it's mostly your piss.

17:13.653 --> 17:15.692
Go and get them. Show 'em who's boss.

17:16.160 --> 17:18.272
Yeah, OK, I will.

17:21.673 --> 17:22.972
Better out than in.

17:24.045 --> 17:25.972
I'm going to go now, then.

17:46.747 --> 17:49.725
I'm curious,
are you subversively mocking this place

17:49.845 --> 17:51.600
or are you actually enjoying this hell?

17:51.720 --> 17:54.870
I'm sorry, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

18:01.827 --> 18:03.163
I've ripped my top!

18:03.283 --> 18:05.850
God, sorry,
you just turn me on so much.

18:05.970 --> 18:07.620
My parents'll see this.

18:14.033 --> 18:15.980
- What the hell are you doing?!
- It's a condom.

18:16.340 --> 18:18.936
- I thought we should be safe.
- Why've you got a condom on?!

18:19.056 --> 18:21.850
- I'm not going to have sex with you!
- You're not?

18:21.970 --> 18:24.052
- But Jay said...
- Jay said what?

18:24.214 --> 18:25.164
He said...

18:25.598 --> 18:27.813
What? What did Jay say?

18:36.522 --> 18:37.973
How's it feel to be a man, then?

18:38.133 --> 18:39.632
You fucking liar.

18:39.880 --> 18:41.806
Shagged her and her sister, have you?

18:41.926 --> 18:43.852
- Loads of times, yeah?
- Untold.

18:44.157 --> 18:46.035
Really? Cos she didn't seem that keen,

18:46.155 --> 18:48.296
and her sister's 13 years old.

18:48.416 --> 18:51.260
I haven't actually shagged her
and her sister exactly,

18:51.380 --> 18:55.264
- but other similar girls.
- Thanks for the condom. I'll be lucky

18:55.384 --> 18:58.255
if I'm not on some sort of paedophile
register by the end of the night.

18:58.375 --> 19:00.973
Fuck, she's talking to her parents.
We'd better go.

19:01.093 --> 19:02.966
- Where's Neil?
- Don't know and don't care.

19:03.086 --> 19:05.552
Let's get out of here. Will, we're off.

19:06.053 --> 19:07.013
Will, come on.

19:13.832 --> 19:14.533
Prick.

19:16.192 --> 19:18.668
<i>And just when I thought things
couldn't get any worse,</i>

19:18.788 --> 19:20.478
<i>I then had to spend a night in a caravan</i>

19:20.598 --> 19:23.209
<i>with Jay's dad and his irritable bowel.</i>

19:25.498 --> 19:27.615
Thanks very much for your hospitality,
Mrs Cartwright.

19:27.735 --> 19:29.726
- See you soon, Mr Cartwright.
- Cheers, lads.

19:29.846 --> 19:32.538
And Simon,
don't worry about that Becky business.

19:32.658 --> 19:35.710
Her dad's calmed down now.
We were all your age once.

19:35.830 --> 19:38.958
At least you had a pop,
unlike soppy bollocks here.

19:39.409 --> 19:40.975
- Thanks.
- Don't mention it.

19:41.095 --> 19:43.745
Just try not to rape anyone
on the way out!

19:45.847 --> 19:47.778
I don't see why I should ever talk
to you again,

19:47.898 --> 19:49.393
let alone give you a lift home.

19:49.513 --> 19:51.425
You're just angry
because you didn't get laid.

19:51.504 --> 19:53.413
- That's it.
- Let's just get out of this dump,

19:53.533 --> 19:57.285
and please God, don't let me ever have
to come back to a caravan park.

19:57.405 --> 19:58.972
- All right?
- Where have you been?

19:59.134 --> 20:02.333
I slept in the car.
Shall we go then? Shotgun.

20:09.970 --> 20:12.163
- My seat's a bit wet.
- Mine is, too.

20:12.283 --> 20:13.749
Yeah, it's wet here as well.

20:13.869 --> 20:15.693
Neil, did you wet yourself
in my new car?

20:15.853 --> 20:17.368
It's not really new.

20:17.908 --> 20:19.612
- Did you wet yourself?
- No.

20:19.773 --> 20:21.414
But I did have a bird back in here.

20:21.534 --> 20:24.416
- You fucked a girl in my car?!
- No, it's too small.

20:24.536 --> 20:28.186
Did a lot of fingering, though.
She wanked me off a few times.

20:28.637 --> 20:29.373
God!

20:29.799 --> 20:31.302
Get me out of here!

20:35.848 --> 20:36.573
Neil!

20:39.171 --> 20:41.133
- Bloody hell!
- Disgusting.

20:42.477 --> 20:43.628
Thanks, Neil!

20:43.748 --> 20:46.665
- Who was she, then?
- Some sort of punky redhead.

20:46.785 --> 20:48.835
- She was nice.
- She was mine!

20:49.096 --> 20:52.101
- Oh, God.
- We can't stay here.

20:52.221 --> 20:53.977
I'm not getting back in the spunkmobile.

20:54.097 --> 20:55.813
- Clean it up, Neil.
- Why?

20:55.973 --> 20:58.092
Because you have spunked on my seats!

20:58.348 --> 21:02.040
Oh, God,
this weekend has been a disaster.

21:02.160 --> 21:05.225
One good thing is we've learned
the Caravan Club is shit

21:05.345 --> 21:08.163
- and that Jay is a liar.
- I'm such a liar?

21:08.283 --> 21:09.665
That Neil got some?

21:09.785 --> 21:11.612
- Neil got some.
- You lied.

21:11.773 --> 21:13.972
- Clean it up, Neil.
- It's your car.

21:14.157 --> 21:17.012
- It's your spunk!
- Some of it could be her juice.

21:17.132 --> 21:18.934
- Did Neil get any?
- That's not the point.

21:19.054 --> 21:21.132
- Yes or no, did Neil get some?
- You lie.

21:21.293 --> 21:23.532
- And I want petrol money.
- For what?

21:23.723 --> 21:26.013
For petrol! Money for petrol.

21:27.480 --> 21:30.092
<i>I'm not sure what we learned
from this sorry episode,</i>

21:30.254 --> 21:32.092
<i>apart from,
never take advice from Jay...</i>

21:32.253 --> 21:34.053
- But Jay said...
- Jay said what?

21:34.473 --> 21:36.984
<i>When you are offered sex, don't skid...</i>

21:37.910 --> 21:41.453
<i>and never, never follow
Mr Cartwright into the toilet.</i>

21:41.613 --> 21:43.133
My eyes are burning!

21:43.293 --> 21:47.292
<i>But as we stood arguing on the side
of the A2, one thing was for sure.</i>

21:47.412 --> 21:50.012
<i>Neil can produce
an unholy amount of spunk.</i>

21:50.300 --> 21:53.293
- And I want this cleaned now.
- No, it's in your car, so it's yours.

21:54.117 --> 21:57.440
So if I spunk on you,
that's yours, is it?

21:57.560 --> 21:59.882
- No.
- You are fucking disgusting.
