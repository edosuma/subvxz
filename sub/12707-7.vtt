00:01.334 --> 00:04.003
Giles:
 Spike. Known
 as William the Bloody.

00:04.038 --> 00:08.375
Earned his nickname
 by torturing his victims
 with railroad spikes.

00:08.409 --> 00:13.580
Spike has fought two slayers
in the last century,
and he's killed them both.

00:21.588 --> 00:24.324
Spike:
 I can't bite anyone.
 I can't even hit people.

00:24.358 --> 00:26.626
I've got this cute little
 government chip in my head.

00:29.562 --> 00:32.533
She's everywhere.
 She's haunting me.

00:34.601 --> 00:37.737
Buffy, I love you.
God, I love you so much.

00:37.771 --> 00:40.841
(Gasps)
oh, god, no.

00:40.874 --> 00:46.579
I need to know more
about where I come from,
about the other Slayers.

00:46.613 --> 00:52.051
Maybe if I can learn to control
this thing, I could be stronger,
I could be better.

00:59.893 --> 01:01.661
(Growling)

01:04.230 --> 01:07.334
You know, it's probably
none of my business,
but I just gotta ask.

01:10.438 --> 01:13.641
Did you smell this bad
when you were alive?

01:13.674 --> 01:16.576
'Cause if it's
a postmortem thing,
then, boy, is my face red.

01:16.609 --> 01:19.379
But, just so you know,

01:19.412 --> 01:21.649
the fast-growing field
of personal grooming's
come a long way...

01:21.682 --> 01:23.516
Since you became a vampire.

01:26.587 --> 01:28.756
(Gasps)

01:33.161 --> 01:36.028
(theme music playing)

02:41.061 --> 02:43.764
(Grunting)

02:46.567 --> 02:49.736
You're goin'?

02:49.770 --> 02:51.704
But you were having
so much fun a minute ago.

03:09.423 --> 03:11.292
(Electrical crackling)

03:17.365 --> 03:19.699
Hey, what happened?
(Breathing heavily)

03:28.542 --> 03:30.578
I can't believe
I passed out.

03:30.610 --> 03:32.879
Do you think
I'm a total wuss now?
Oh, yeah.

03:32.913 --> 03:35.949
I like a girl who can play
a few hard sets of tennis
with a major stab wound.

03:35.983 --> 03:38.918
You said
it wasn't that bad.

03:38.951 --> 03:42.088
I said I've seen worse.
There's a difference.

03:42.122 --> 03:44.625
Well, at least no major
organs got kabobed.

03:44.658 --> 03:46.793
I still think you need
to see a real doctor.

03:46.826 --> 03:50.430
That would put me in a real
hospital, which would get
my real mom real freaked out.

03:50.463 --> 03:52.932
I can't do it. Don't worry.

03:52.966 --> 03:56.704
Accelerated healing powers
come with the slayer package.

03:56.736 --> 03:59.573
And the boyfriend
who comes complete with
combat medical training?

03:59.606 --> 04:01.741
That's just
a Buffy Summers bonus.

04:01.775 --> 04:05.812
So, tell me about
the bad guy or guys.
What do you think they were?

04:05.846 --> 04:08.115
Vampire.
How many?

04:09.782 --> 04:12.586
One.

04:12.620 --> 04:15.122
So, what, he was like
a super vampire or something?

04:16.456 --> 04:18.190
No. He was the regular kind.

04:19.660 --> 04:21.329
He just beat me.

04:23.531 --> 04:26.300
That ever happen before?

04:26.334 --> 04:28.268
I'm in the best
physical shape of my life.

04:28.302 --> 04:30.069
I mean, if you're asking
how it happened, I don't--

04:30.103 --> 04:32.072
-(door opens)
-Dawn!

04:32.105 --> 04:33.441
Sorry to interrupt
the sex-capades.

04:33.473 --> 04:37.310
I just wanted to tell you
that mom's coming.

04:37.345 --> 04:40.247
-Joyce: Hi, Riley.
-Hey, Ms. Summers.

04:40.279 --> 04:42.750
How are you feeling?
I'm fine,

04:42.783 --> 04:44.317
bordering on chipper,

04:44.351 --> 04:46.454
and tomorrow, planning
on being obnoxious.

04:46.487 --> 04:48.288
(Chuckles)
glad to hear it.

04:48.322 --> 04:49.757
Buffy, when you have a minute,

04:49.790 --> 04:52.125
I'd like to go over the grocery
list for next week.

04:52.158 --> 04:56.196
-You got it.
-Are you disinfecting something?

04:56.228 --> 04:58.432
-Buffy: Hmm? Oh! Uh--
-Mine.

04:58.466 --> 05:02.470
Uh, some nail polish
experiments are doomed
before they even begin.

05:02.502 --> 05:05.406
But you keep pushing
the envelope, honey.

05:08.641 --> 05:12.178
Did I just pull a slayer-related
mom cover-up thing?

05:13.814 --> 05:16.483
Come on. Who's the man?
Buffy:
You are.

05:16.516 --> 05:18.685
A very short,
annoying man.

05:22.423 --> 05:24.057
If I show you something,
you promise you won't tell?

05:28.528 --> 05:31.365
Oh, cool!

05:31.399 --> 05:35.168
I-I mean, gross.
And Mom cannot know, okay?

05:35.201 --> 05:37.336
You'll help me with
the household stuff?

05:37.370 --> 05:40.206
Oh, sure.
I save your butt, and you
dump all your chores on me.

05:40.240 --> 05:41.942
Dawn.

05:43.276 --> 05:46.514
I got it.
You're covered. We're good.

05:46.547 --> 05:48.247
Just lucky
it's not bikini season.

05:49.917 --> 05:53.887
So, Dawn takes household duty.
I'll take tonight's patrol.

05:53.920 --> 05:56.723
By yourself?
Just a sweep.

05:56.757 --> 06:00.560
Do me a favor.
You take the gang along with?

06:00.593 --> 06:04.264
Okay. I will patrol
with the group tonight.

06:04.297 --> 06:07.266
-When do I get to patrol?
-Not until you're never.

06:25.819 --> 06:28.456
(Munching loudly)

06:28.488 --> 06:31.459
What's with
the hand move?
You see that?

06:31.492 --> 06:33.761
-Does that, like,
mean something?
-It's code.

06:33.793 --> 06:37.230
I think it breaks down
to "choo choo"!

06:37.264 --> 06:40.300
It probably means
to follow him.

06:40.332 --> 06:42.101
That, or wait here
for him.

06:47.139 --> 06:48.942
(Whispering)
Ask.

06:50.310 --> 06:52.312
Hey, Riley!

06:52.345 --> 06:55.048
-What's the, uh-- all about?
-It means yell real loud,

06:55.081 --> 06:57.617
so the vampires
who don't know we're coming
will have a sporting chance.

06:59.119 --> 07:01.420
See? Now he's all
mad and sarcastic.

07:01.454 --> 07:05.759
It's because you were doing all
the yelling, Mr. Stealthy pants.
It's their fault.

07:05.793 --> 07:08.228
Guys,
I'm thinking if we split up,
we could cover more ground.

07:08.261 --> 07:12.165
Tell you what.
I'll take the cemeteries.
You guys get The Bronze.

07:12.199 --> 07:14.468
Are we not being
covert enough?
We're sorry!

07:14.502 --> 07:16.970
Sorry.

07:17.004 --> 07:19.005
We'll be sneakier. Promise.
(Munches loudly)

07:19.038 --> 07:23.310
Okay. Just ditch the chips
and watch my back.

07:23.343 --> 07:25.512
Done.

07:26.879 --> 07:29.149
(Munching)

07:29.182 --> 07:32.685
You know what he's like?
He's like a cat.

07:32.720 --> 07:35.755
You know, a big jungle cat.
How come I'm not like that?

07:35.788 --> 07:38.591
It's just so cool.

07:38.625 --> 07:41.228
(Mouth full)
I think you're cool.

07:46.567 --> 07:49.802
Here's another one.
Early 18th-century slayer.

07:49.836 --> 07:53.540
Good. Let's hope she'll be
more helpful than this last one.

07:53.574 --> 07:56.209
-Why? What does it say?
-Same as all the others.

07:56.242 --> 07:59.045
Slayer called, blah, blah.
Great protector, blah, blah.

07:59.079 --> 08:02.516
Scary battles, blah, blah.
Oops! She's dead.

08:02.550 --> 08:05.853
-Where are the details?
-Details?

08:05.886 --> 08:09.856
Well, it says this slayer
forged her own weapons.

08:11.759 --> 08:14.394
Gotta love a gal
with an anvil.

08:14.427 --> 08:16.797
But where are the details
of the Slayer's last battle?

08:16.829 --> 08:18.831
You know, what made
that fight special?

08:18.865 --> 08:21.300
Why did she lose?

08:21.334 --> 08:24.237
-You didn't lose last night,
Buffy. You just--
-got really close.

08:25.939 --> 08:28.175
I slipped up, Giles.

08:28.207 --> 08:31.177
I've been training harder
than ever, and still--

08:31.211 --> 08:35.582
And there's nothing
in any of these books
to help me understand why.

08:35.615 --> 08:38.418
I mean, look.

08:38.451 --> 08:42.389
I realize that every slayer
comes with an expiration
mark on the package.

08:42.422 --> 08:44.924
But I want mine to be
a long time from now,

08:44.957 --> 08:47.226
like a cheeto.

08:47.259 --> 08:51.865
If there were just a few
good descriptions of what
took out the other slayers,

08:51.899 --> 08:53.866
maybe it would help me
to understand my mistake,

08:53.900 --> 08:56.003
to keep it
from happening again.

08:56.036 --> 08:59.239
Yes, well, the, uh,
the problem is...

08:59.272 --> 09:03.009
that after
a final battle,

09:03.043 --> 09:06.580
it, uh, it's difficult
to get any, um--

09:06.614 --> 09:10.549
Well, the slayer's not--
she's rather, uh--

09:10.583 --> 09:12.552
It's okay to use
the "D" word, Giles.

09:12.586 --> 09:16.423
Dead, and hence,
not very forthcoming.

09:16.456 --> 09:21.394
Why didn't the watchers
keep fuller accounts of it?
The journals just stop.

09:21.427 --> 09:25.264
I suppose if they're anything
like me, they just found
the whole subject too, uh--

09:25.298 --> 09:28.034
Unseemly?

09:28.067 --> 09:32.471
Damn. Love ya,
but you watchers
are such prigs sometimes.

09:32.504 --> 09:35.307
Painful,
I was gonna say.

09:40.780 --> 09:44.951
But you're right.
The accounts of the final
battles would be very helpful,

09:44.985 --> 09:48.120
but, uh,
there's no one left
to tell the tales.

09:51.290 --> 09:52.893
What?

09:52.926 --> 09:57.264
(Grunts)
Ow! Wait. Not "ow."

09:57.297 --> 09:59.966
Are you feeling
all right, Slayer?
This stuff usually hurts.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.802
Don't even start, Spike.
What do you want?

10:04.004 --> 10:06.472
Slayers.
You killed two of them.

10:08.808 --> 10:11.344
I did.

10:11.378 --> 10:13.681
You're gonna
show me how.

10:23.123 --> 10:26.793
You know, there are
quite a few American beers
that are highly underrated.

10:26.826 --> 10:30.163
This, unfortunately,
is not one of them.
Update, Spike.

10:30.263 --> 10:32.700
We're not here to discuss
the fine choice of hops.

10:32.732 --> 10:37.470
It's about two slayers,
one in China during the Boxer
Rebellion, one in New York.

10:37.504 --> 10:40.173
Both got killed by you.

10:40.206 --> 10:43.610
Tell the tale,
you get the cash.
Right.

10:43.643 --> 10:46.947
You want to learn all about
how I bested the Slayers,
and you want to learn fast.

10:46.980 --> 10:50.817
Right, then. We fought.
I won. The end. Pay up.

10:50.850 --> 10:52.720
That's not what I--
What did you want, eh?

10:52.753 --> 10:56.523
A quick demo?
A blow-for-blow description
you can map out and memorize?

10:56.556 --> 10:58.991
(Scoffs)
it's not about
the moves, love.

10:59.025 --> 11:03.296
And since I agreed
to your little proposition,
we're gonna do this my way.

11:03.330 --> 11:05.032
Wings.

11:06.265 --> 11:08.500
-What?
-Spicy buffalo wings.

11:08.534 --> 11:10.903
Order me up a plate.
I'm feeling peckish.

11:12.105 --> 11:13.907
(Sighs)

11:15.708 --> 11:18.411
Excuse--

11:18.445 --> 11:20.547
As I thought earlier--

11:20.580 --> 11:23.716
Some nasty thing
got a taste of you.

11:23.750 --> 11:26.485
Don't get all excited.
I'm fine.

11:26.519 --> 11:29.022
Oh, right.
Stuck in a dark corner
with a creature you loathe,

11:29.056 --> 11:31.024
diggin' up past uglies,
'cause you're "fine."

11:31.057 --> 11:34.260
Just tell me
what I want to know.
I told you.

11:34.293 --> 11:36.395
No one's narrating
on an empty stomach here.

11:37.764 --> 11:39.767
Were you born
this big a pain in the ass?

11:39.799 --> 11:42.936
What can I tell you, baby?

11:42.970 --> 11:45.572
I've always been bad.

11:45.605 --> 11:51.110
(Classical violin)
Luminous.
Oh, no, no, no, no.

11:51.144 --> 11:55.849
You're-you're radiant.
That's better.

11:55.883 --> 11:58.717
(Footsteps approach)
Man:
Care for an hors d'oeuvre, sir?

11:58.751 --> 12:01.020
Oh, uh, quickly.

12:01.053 --> 12:03.123
I'm the very spirit
of vexation.

12:03.155 --> 12:05.424
What's another word
for "gleaming"?

12:05.457 --> 12:08.928
It's a perfectly perfect
word as many words go,

12:08.961 --> 12:11.163
but the bother is
nothing rhymes, you see.

12:18.806 --> 12:22.042
(All chattering, indistinct)

12:22.075 --> 12:24.010
Cecily.

12:39.292 --> 12:42.328
I merely point out that
it's something of a mystery,

12:42.361 --> 12:44.898
and the police should
keep an open mind.

12:44.932 --> 12:47.567
Ah, William!
Favor us with your opinion.

12:47.600 --> 12:50.971
What do you make of this
rash of disappearances
sweeping through our town?

12:51.004 --> 12:53.306
Animals or thieves?

12:53.340 --> 12:56.676
I prefer not to
think of such dark,
ugly business at all.

12:56.709 --> 12:58.711
That's what
the police are for.

13:01.849 --> 13:05.985
I prefer placing my energies
into creating things of beauty.
I see.

13:06.019 --> 13:08.855
Well, don't withhold, William.

13:08.889 --> 13:10.957
Rescue us from
a dreary topic.

13:10.990 --> 13:13.625
Careful!

13:13.659 --> 13:17.998
The inks are still wet.
Please, it's not finished.
Don't be shy.

13:19.466 --> 13:23.702
"My heart expands,
'tis grown a bulge in it,

13:23.735 --> 13:27.673
"inspired by
your beauty effulgent."

13:27.706 --> 13:30.476
-Effulgent?
-(Laughter)

13:39.219 --> 13:42.688
And that's actually one
of his better compositions.

13:42.721 --> 13:45.057
Have you heard?

13:45.091 --> 13:47.961
They call him "William
the Bloody" because of
his bloody awful poetry.

13:47.995 --> 13:50.129
It suits him!

13:50.163 --> 13:52.365
I'd rather have a railroad
spike through my head...

13:52.399 --> 13:55.201
than listen to that awful stuff!

13:55.235 --> 13:57.336
(Laughter continues)

13:57.370 --> 14:00.340
-Cecily?
-Oh!

14:00.373 --> 14:03.143
Leave me alone!

14:03.176 --> 14:06.013
Oh!
(Laughs)

14:06.046 --> 14:08.681
They're vulgarians.

14:08.715 --> 14:10.850
They're not
like you and I.

14:10.884 --> 14:14.520
You and I?

14:14.553 --> 14:17.224
I'm going to ask you
a very personal question.

14:17.256 --> 14:19.525
And I demand
an honest answer.

14:19.558 --> 14:23.196
Do you understand?

14:23.230 --> 14:25.999
Your poetry, it's--

14:26.033 --> 14:28.735
They're...

14:28.768 --> 14:30.903
not written
about me, are they?

14:30.937 --> 14:34.073
They're about how I feel.

14:34.106 --> 14:36.709
Yes, but are they
about me?

14:40.113 --> 14:42.215
Every syllable.

14:42.249 --> 14:46.219
Oh, god!
Oh, uh, I know.

14:46.253 --> 14:49.422
It's sudden, and...

14:49.456 --> 14:53.592
and, please,
if they're no good,
they're only words, but...

14:53.625 --> 14:56.895
The feeling behind them--

14:56.929 --> 14:59.231
I love you, Cecily.

14:59.265 --> 15:01.433
Please stop!
I--

15:02.936 --> 15:07.440
I know I'm a bad poet,
but I'm a good man.

15:07.474 --> 15:10.243
All I ask is that--

15:10.277 --> 15:13.513
Is that you try to see me--
I do see you.

15:14.681 --> 15:16.349
That's the problem.

15:17.985 --> 15:19.851
You're nothing
to me, William.

15:25.792 --> 15:27.360
You're beneath me.

15:40.307 --> 15:42.875
(Ripping)

15:46.513 --> 15:50.716
(Sobs)
Watch where you're going!

16:10.037 --> 16:14.140
And I wonder what
possible catastrophe...

16:14.173 --> 16:17.043
came crashing down
from heaven...

16:17.076 --> 16:21.048
and brought this
dashing stranger to tears?

16:21.081 --> 16:23.049
Nothing.

16:23.082 --> 16:25.018
I wish to be alone.

16:25.052 --> 16:27.986
Oh, I see you.

16:28.020 --> 16:31.624
A man surrounded
by fools who cannot
see his strength,

16:31.658 --> 16:33.625
his vision,

16:33.659 --> 16:35.827
his glory.

16:37.730 --> 16:41.634
That, and burning
baby fish swimming
all around your head.

16:41.668 --> 16:45.272
Uh, that-that's
quite close enough.

16:45.371 --> 16:47.740
I've heard tales
of London pickpockets.

16:47.774 --> 16:50.942
You'll not be getting
my purse, I tell you.

16:52.111 --> 16:54.713
Don't need your purse.

16:56.014 --> 16:58.551
Your wealth...

16:58.585 --> 17:01.888
lies here and here,

17:03.022 --> 17:05.022
in the spirit and...

17:08.728 --> 17:11.829
imagination.

17:11.864 --> 17:16.736
You walk in worlds the others
can't begin to imagine.

17:18.037 --> 17:19.939
Oh, yes!

17:21.473 --> 17:24.611
Uh, I mean no.

17:24.644 --> 17:26.846
I mean, uh,

17:26.877 --> 17:28.647
Mother's expecting me.

17:30.250 --> 17:32.684
I see what you want.

17:32.719 --> 17:36.455
Something glowing
and glistening.

17:36.489 --> 17:38.325
Something...

17:40.792 --> 17:42.662
Effulgent.

17:44.596 --> 17:46.499
(Whispers)
Effulgent.

17:49.969 --> 17:51.938
Do you want it?

17:53.072 --> 17:54.773
Oh, yes.

18:01.079 --> 18:02.848
God, yes!

18:18.498 --> 18:21.667
Ow! Ow!

18:21.701 --> 18:24.604
Ow! Ow! Ow!

18:24.636 --> 18:26.838
(Yelling)

18:38.817 --> 18:43.021
Guys.
What you got?

18:43.055 --> 18:46.192
Riley:
That's him.

18:46.226 --> 18:48.126
Let's go.

19:14.686 --> 19:16.489
(Chattering inside)

19:25.897 --> 19:28.867
(Chattering, laughter)
Vampire:
I just ripped into her. Yeah.

19:28.901 --> 19:32.538
I stabbed her
and she was, like--
(yelling)

19:36.509 --> 19:38.744
It sounds like
a party in there.

19:38.778 --> 19:40.913
Forget about crashing.
There's too many of them.

19:40.947 --> 19:43.849
We'll come back at daybreak
when they're asleep,
and we're better armed.

19:43.883 --> 19:47.519
It's okay. We can kill them
just as dead in the morning.

19:50.522 --> 19:53.159
Nine in the corner.

19:53.192 --> 19:55.894
So you traded up
on the food chain.
Then what?

19:55.927 --> 19:58.730
No, please.

19:58.765 --> 20:03.169
Don't make it sound like
something you'd flip past
on the discovery channel.

20:03.201 --> 20:08.575
Becoming a vampire
is a profound and
powerful experience.

20:08.607 --> 20:11.844
I could feel
this new strength
coursing through me.

20:11.877 --> 20:15.114
Getting killed
made me feel alive
for the very first time.

20:17.215 --> 20:20.452
I was through
living by society's rules.

20:20.487 --> 20:23.623
Decided to make
a few of my own.

20:23.655 --> 20:25.892
Of course,
in order to do that...

20:30.162 --> 20:32.932
I had to get myself a gang.

20:32.964 --> 20:35.801
Perhaps it's my advancing
years that makes me so
forgetful, William.

20:35.835 --> 20:39.238
Remind me.
Why don't we kill you?

20:39.271 --> 20:43.041
-(Choking)
Spike--
-what's that?

20:43.075 --> 20:44.977
(Gasping)

20:46.979 --> 20:49.582
It's Spike now.

20:50.817 --> 20:52.951
You'd do well
to remember it, mate.

20:52.984 --> 20:55.555
I'm not your mate,
and when did you start
talking like that?

20:55.587 --> 20:58.657
We barely got out of London
alive because of you.

20:58.691 --> 21:01.961
Everywhere we go,
it's the same story, and now--

21:01.993 --> 21:05.765
You've got me and my women
hiding in the luxury
of a mine shaft.

21:05.798 --> 21:09.201
All because
William the Bloody
likes the attention.

21:10.636 --> 21:13.071
This is not
a reputation we need.

21:13.105 --> 21:18.076
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I sully
our good name? We're vampires.

21:18.109 --> 21:20.313
All the more reason
to use a certain
amount of finesse.

21:20.346 --> 21:23.148
Bollocks! That stuff's
for the frilly
cuffs-and-collars crowd.

21:23.182 --> 21:24.884
I'll take a good
brawl any day.

21:27.953 --> 21:31.624
And every time you do,
we become the hunted.

21:31.657 --> 21:34.794
(Singsong)
I think our boys
are going to fight.

21:34.826 --> 21:37.730
The King of Cups
expects a picnic,

21:37.829 --> 21:43.201
(Giggles)
but this is not his birthday.
Good point.

21:43.234 --> 21:45.805
Yeah.
You know what I prefer
to being hunted?

21:45.837 --> 21:47.973
Getting caught.

21:48.007 --> 21:50.442
That's brilliant strategy,
really. Pure cunning.

21:50.477 --> 21:54.713
Sod off!
(Laughs)

21:54.747 --> 21:57.148
Come on.
When was the last time
you unleashed it?

21:57.182 --> 21:59.451
All-out fighting a mob,

21:59.486 --> 22:02.721
back against the wall,
nothing but fist and fangs?

22:02.755 --> 22:06.192
Don't you ever
get tired of fights
you know you're gonna win?

22:06.224 --> 22:09.628
No.
A real kill, a good kill,
it takes pure artistry.

22:09.662 --> 22:11.498
Without that,
we're just animals.

22:11.530 --> 22:14.000
Poofter.

22:24.611 --> 22:27.880
Now you're gettin' it!
(Laughs)

22:29.415 --> 22:31.451
You can't keep this up forever.

22:33.752 --> 22:38.057
If I can't teach you, maybe
someday an angry crowd will.

22:38.089 --> 22:41.160
That--
(chuckles)

22:41.192 --> 22:43.730
or the Slayer.

22:44.931 --> 22:46.865
What's a slayer?

22:48.601 --> 22:51.037
After that,
I was obsessed.

22:51.069 --> 22:53.705
I mean, to most vampires,

22:53.740 --> 22:56.643
a slayer was this
object of cold sweat
and frightened whispers...

22:58.644 --> 23:01.580
But I never hid.

23:01.614 --> 23:03.849
Hell,
I sought her out.

23:03.883 --> 23:07.753
If you're looking for fun,
there's death, there's glory,
and sod all else, right?

23:07.787 --> 23:10.490
I was young.
So, how'd you kill her?

23:12.759 --> 23:14.826
Funny you should ask.

23:17.296 --> 23:19.965
Lesson the first--

23:19.999 --> 23:22.501
A slayer must always
reach for her weapon.

23:26.337 --> 23:28.106
I've already got mine.

23:31.009 --> 23:33.179
Hmm.

23:37.650 --> 23:40.286
Good thing too.

23:40.318 --> 23:43.722
Become a vampire,
you've got nothing to fear.

23:43.756 --> 23:46.092
Nothing but one girl.

23:46.125 --> 23:49.060
That's you, honey.

23:49.095 --> 23:51.963
Back then,

23:51.998 --> 23:53.833
it was her.

23:55.667 --> 23:58.471
(Grunting, growling)

24:07.614 --> 24:09.615
(Laughs)

24:10.650 --> 24:13.019
(Clamoring)

24:13.051 --> 24:15.887
(Gunshots)

24:26.397 --> 24:28.734
Just like I pictured it.
This good for you?

25:29.228 --> 25:33.199
(Speaking Chinese)

25:33.231 --> 25:36.001
I'm sorry, love.

25:36.035 --> 25:37.804
I don't speak Chinese.

25:44.644 --> 25:47.445
A fella could
get used to this.

25:56.288 --> 25:58.390
Drusilla:
Oh, Spike.

25:58.423 --> 26:02.361
Look at the wonderful
mess you've made.

26:02.394 --> 26:05.096
That's a slayer
you've done in.

26:05.131 --> 26:10.135
Naughty, wicked Spike.

26:25.517 --> 26:27.185
(Grunts)

26:32.023 --> 26:34.559
You ever hear them say...

26:34.593 --> 26:38.931
The blood of a slayer
is a powerful aphrodisiac?

26:41.599 --> 26:44.103
Here now...

26:45.336 --> 26:47.472
Have a taste.

27:19.238 --> 27:21.207
(Clamoring)
(gunshots)

27:27.747 --> 27:29.548
(Chattering, indistinct)

27:30.382 --> 27:32.518
Wonderful.

27:32.550 --> 27:34.619
So where have
you two been?

27:34.653 --> 27:36.756
May I tell?
No need to be humble.

27:38.691 --> 27:42.761
My little Spike just
killed himself a slayer.
(Giggles)

27:47.398 --> 27:50.301
Congratulations.
I guess that makes
you one of us.

27:50.336 --> 27:53.305
Don't be so glum, mate!

27:53.338 --> 27:56.041
The way you tell it,
one slayer snuffs it,
another one rises.

27:56.075 --> 27:58.978
I figure there's
a new chosen one gettin'
all chosen as we speak.

27:59.010 --> 28:02.681
I'll tell you what.
When and if this new
bird does show up,

28:02.714 --> 28:05.084
I'll give you
first crack at her.

28:05.116 --> 28:07.519
(Growls)

28:07.553 --> 28:09.387
I smell fear.

28:10.722 --> 28:12.590
Yeah. This whole
place reeks of it.

28:12.624 --> 28:15.227
It's intoxicating.

28:15.260 --> 28:17.563
Let's get out of here.
This rebellion's
starting to bore me.

28:17.596 --> 28:19.565
(Laughing)

28:46.224 --> 28:48.927
That was the best
night of my life.

28:50.628 --> 28:53.231
And I've had some sweet ones.

28:54.800 --> 28:56.868
What are you lookin' at?

28:56.903 --> 28:59.939
You got off on it.

28:59.971 --> 29:03.709
Well, yeah. I suppose
you're telling me you don't?

29:03.741 --> 29:06.577
(Laughs)

29:06.612 --> 29:09.414
How many of my kind
reckon you've done?

29:09.448 --> 29:15.086
Not enough.
Mm-hmm.
And we just keep coming.

29:15.121 --> 29:19.057
But you can kill
a hundred, a thousand,
a thousand thousand,

29:19.090 --> 29:22.428
and the armies of hell besides,
and all we need...

29:22.461 --> 29:25.230
is for one of us--
just one--

29:25.263 --> 29:28.767
sooner or later
to have the thing
we're all hoping for.

29:30.169 --> 29:31.971
And that would be what?

29:36.041 --> 29:39.411
One good day.

29:39.444 --> 29:43.082
Hey! You asked,
and I'm tellin'.

29:43.115 --> 29:45.151
The problem with you, Summers,
is you've gotten so good,

29:45.183 --> 29:47.618
-You're starting to think
you're immortal.
-Not really.

29:47.653 --> 29:49.587
I just know
I can handle myself.

29:49.621 --> 29:52.490
Oh. Then how do you
explain this?

29:52.523 --> 29:55.862
Ow!
(Yells)
oh, god!

30:00.731 --> 30:03.301
So that's it?
Lesson over?

30:03.335 --> 30:06.337
Not even close.

30:06.372 --> 30:08.207
Come on.

30:13.144 --> 30:15.547
Vampire:
Killed with her own weapon.

30:15.580 --> 30:18.150
They ought to put this
in a museum.

30:18.183 --> 30:21.153
You know what they put
in museums?

30:21.186 --> 30:23.189
-Mostly dead things.
-(Growls)

30:45.877 --> 30:48.413
Give it to me.

30:53.384 --> 30:56.721
(Laughing)
What?

30:56.755 --> 30:59.657
Lesson the second--
ask the right questions.

30:59.691 --> 31:01.426
You want to know
how I beat 'em?

31:03.694 --> 31:06.731
The question isn't
how'd I win?

31:06.765 --> 31:09.902
-The question is
why'd they lose?
-What's the difference?

31:12.703 --> 31:15.273
There's a big
difference, love.

31:16.741 --> 31:18.944
How'd you kill
the second one?

31:18.978 --> 31:21.279
Hmm? A bit like this.

31:23.915 --> 31:27.853
-That didn't hurt?
-I knew I couldn't touch you.

31:27.885 --> 31:29.922
If there's no intent
to hurt you,

31:29.955 --> 31:34.425
then that chip
they shoved up my brain
never activates.

31:34.460 --> 31:36.627
If, on the other hand--

31:36.662 --> 31:39.131
(Growls, yells)

31:43.001 --> 31:44.903
See, now that hurt.
Yeah?

31:44.936 --> 31:46.904
This hurt too?

31:48.473 --> 31:51.076
Definite pain there.

31:51.109 --> 31:54.279
-How'd you kill them, Spike?
-(Growls)

31:58.750 --> 32:01.988
You're not ready to know.
I'm ready.

32:02.087 --> 32:04.623
Okay, then.
Went like this.

32:16.801 --> 32:18.737
The first one
was all business,
but the second,

32:18.769 --> 32:21.207
she had a touch
of your style.

32:40.826 --> 32:43.862
(Yelling)

32:58.743 --> 33:00.711
She was cunning,
resourceful--

33:00.746 --> 33:03.449
Oh, and did I mention... hot?

33:03.481 --> 33:05.517
I could have danced
all night with that one.

33:05.550 --> 33:08.519
You think we're dancing?
That's all
we've ever done.

33:11.423 --> 33:14.326
The only thing
 about the dance is...

33:14.359 --> 33:17.128
You never get to stop.

33:17.163 --> 33:20.632
Every day you wake up,
it's the same bloody
question that haunts you--

33:20.665 --> 33:23.368
Is today the day I die?

33:27.705 --> 33:29.708
Death is on your heels, baby,

33:29.740 --> 33:31.942
and sooner or later,
it's gonna catch you.

33:36.781 --> 33:39.351
And part of you wants it...

33:39.384 --> 33:42.087
Not only to stop
the fear and uncertainty,

33:42.121 --> 33:45.090
but because you're just
a little bit in love with it.

34:01.106 --> 34:04.910
Death is your art.
You make it with your
hands day after day...

34:04.942 --> 34:08.713
That final gasp,
that look of peace.

34:08.746 --> 34:13.219
Part of you
is desperate to know--
what's it like?

34:13.251 --> 34:15.786
Where does it lead you?

34:15.820 --> 34:18.523
And now, you see,
that's the secret.

34:18.556 --> 34:21.960
Not the punch you didn't throw
or the kicks you didn't land.

34:21.992 --> 34:24.027
She merely wanted it.

34:24.061 --> 34:25.731
Every slayer...

34:27.266 --> 34:29.400
has a death wish.

34:33.003 --> 34:34.940
Even you.

34:55.260 --> 34:58.164
The only reason you've lasted
as long as you have...

34:58.197 --> 35:01.099
is you've got
ties to the world--

35:01.132 --> 35:05.771
Your mum, brat kid sister,
scoobies.

35:05.804 --> 35:09.474
They all tie you here,
but you're just putting
off the inevitable.

35:11.976 --> 35:14.112
Sooner or later...

35:14.146 --> 35:16.581
you're gonna want it.

35:16.614 --> 35:18.750
And the second--

35:18.784 --> 35:21.152
The second that happens,

35:21.186 --> 35:22.987
you know I'll be there.

35:24.489 --> 35:26.824
I'll slip in.

35:26.858 --> 35:30.396
Have myself a real good day.

35:34.800 --> 35:36.635
Here endeth the lesson.

35:38.204 --> 35:41.039
I just wonder if you'll
like it as much as she did.

35:41.072 --> 35:44.009
Get out of my sight,
Spike, now.

35:44.041 --> 35:47.246
Oh, did I scare you?

35:48.746 --> 35:52.251
You're the slayer.
Do something about it. Hit me.

35:53.751 --> 35:57.456
Come on. One good swing.
You know you want to.

35:57.489 --> 36:02.393
I mean it.
So do I. Give it
to me good, Buffy. Do it!

36:02.427 --> 36:04.230
Spike.

36:08.500 --> 36:10.902
What the hell
are you doing?

36:13.338 --> 36:16.442
Come on. I can
feel it, Slayer.

36:18.210 --> 36:20.579
You know you want to dance.

36:22.713 --> 36:24.550
Say it's true.

36:26.351 --> 36:29.221
Say I do want to.

36:32.557 --> 36:34.360
It wouldn't be you, Spike.

36:36.527 --> 36:38.929
It would never be you.

36:44.735 --> 36:47.204
You're beneath me.

36:57.949 --> 36:59.784
(Sniffles)

37:06.090 --> 37:07.958
(Sobs)

37:29.414 --> 37:31.416
Spike, what are you doing?

37:31.449 --> 37:34.251
Beneath me.
I'll show her.

37:35.521 --> 37:37.755
Put her six bloody
feet beneath me.

37:40.090 --> 37:43.461
Hasn't got a death wish?

37:43.494 --> 37:46.197
Bitch won't need one.

37:52.771 --> 37:55.172
Okay, I'm trying
to be supportive here,

37:55.206 --> 37:58.909
so don't drive a stake
through my heart
like last time, but...

37:58.943 --> 38:01.579
(Sighs)
you can't kill Buffy.

38:01.612 --> 38:04.615
She's the Slayer.
She is so gonna kick your ass.

38:04.650 --> 38:07.085
I've got two barrels here
that'll prove you wrong.

38:07.117 --> 38:09.019
I knew you'd
take this personally.

38:09.054 --> 38:11.989
You are so sensitive.

38:12.023 --> 38:14.460
How are you gonna
kill her? Think!

38:14.492 --> 38:16.594
The second you even
point that thing at her,

38:16.628 --> 38:18.764
You're gonna be all--
(yells)

38:18.797 --> 38:20.965
And then you'll
get bitch slapped
up and down main street,

38:20.998 --> 38:23.934
unless she's had enough
and just stakes you.
Sure.

38:23.969 --> 38:27.137
It'll hurt like hell
for about two hours.

38:27.172 --> 38:29.807
But she'll be dead just
a little longer than that.

38:31.577 --> 38:34.646
Fine! But don't come
crying to me when you fail!

38:34.679 --> 38:38.983
You couldn't kill her
before you got the chip.
You had plenty of chances!

38:39.016 --> 38:41.619
Drusilla:
Why can't you kill her?

38:41.652 --> 38:44.222
You're the one who
keeps bringing her up!

38:44.255 --> 38:47.559
I haven't said a word
about the bloody Slayer
since we left California.

38:47.592 --> 38:49.695
She's on the other side
of the planet, Dru!

38:49.728 --> 38:52.230
But you're lying!

38:52.262 --> 38:55.534
I can still see her
floating all around you,

38:55.567 --> 38:58.302
laughing.

38:58.335 --> 39:00.806
Why?

39:00.838 --> 39:05.811
Why won't you push her away?
But I did, pet.
I did it for you.

39:05.844 --> 39:07.679
And you keep
punishing me,

39:08.914 --> 39:11.016
carrying on with
creatures like this.

39:13.251 --> 39:18.023
Okay. Uh, you guys obviously
have a thing going on here.

39:19.257 --> 39:22.027
I have to find
my pleasures, Spike.

39:22.059 --> 39:25.431
You taste like ashes.

39:25.463 --> 39:27.532
So this is
 my fault now?

39:30.235 --> 39:32.570
I-I didn't know
she was seein' somebody.

39:35.206 --> 39:37.007
I-I should take off.

39:37.041 --> 39:39.545
Yeah.
Why don't you do that?

39:42.447 --> 39:46.418
You can't
blame a girl, Spike.

39:46.452 --> 39:48.253
You're all covered with her.

39:50.456 --> 39:53.458
I look at you...

39:53.492 --> 39:55.827
all I see is the Slayer.

40:00.998 --> 40:03.802
Hey, I put together
that grocery list for you.

40:03.835 --> 40:05.737
Oh, great. Thanks, hon.

40:07.237 --> 40:10.041
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

40:10.074 --> 40:12.543
Have you seen
my conditioner?

40:12.577 --> 40:15.146
Did you look
under the sink?

40:21.853 --> 40:24.255
Where are you going?

40:24.289 --> 40:28.092
Oh. I was hoping
to put this off, but, um,

40:28.126 --> 40:32.797
you know the "nothing"
that I've been dealing with
the last couple of weeks?

40:32.831 --> 40:35.032
It might not be nothing.

40:36.101 --> 40:37.969
What is it?

40:39.637 --> 40:42.940
I'm, uh, staying overnight
at the hospital for observation.

40:42.974 --> 40:44.775
I'm getting a CAT scan.

40:47.144 --> 40:49.280
It's only one night.

40:49.313 --> 40:52.416
And they say even if
there is something,

40:52.449 --> 40:55.186
it's still very early
if they didn't see it before.

40:57.054 --> 40:59.657
I'm gonna be fine.

41:01.159 --> 41:03.628
I know you will.

41:30.420 --> 41:32.891
(Sobbing)

41:59.184 --> 42:01.418
What do you want now?

42:11.797 --> 42:13.864
What's wrong?

42:17.902 --> 42:19.871
I don't want to talk about it.

42:28.313 --> 42:31.282
Is there something I can do?

43:54.565 --> 43:57.467
(theme music plays)

44:24.228 --> 44:26.563
Grr! Arrgh!
