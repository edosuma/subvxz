WEBVTT

00:06.000 --> 00:08.875
A NETFLIX SERIES

01:23.583 --> 01:26.916
They've got three guys
at the end of the tunnel, as expected.

01:39.291 --> 01:41.333
The gold is about 200 meters back.

01:41.416 --> 01:43.041
They're loading the stones now.

02:05.750 --> 02:06.875
Let's go.

02:10.208 --> 02:12.708
We gotta be quick.
The other team will be here soon.

02:12.791 --> 02:14.583
We only have ten minutes to get it all.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.791
Drop the gold. Come on, go!

04:08.083 --> 04:09.583
I said get the fuck out!

04:09.666 --> 04:10.500
On the ground!

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
Freeze! Stay right there, don't move!
I said don't move!

04:18.833 --> 04:19.833
Out of the truck!

04:21.666 --> 04:23.708
You wanna die? Get down here!

04:24.541 --> 04:26.250
Let's go. Hurry up! Faster!

04:27.166 --> 04:28.500
Face down, now!

04:32.125 --> 04:33.250
Keep your head down!

04:43.333 --> 04:45.458
All clear. We're good.

05:03.166 --> 05:04.541
Come on, come on, come on!

05:04.625 --> 05:06.791
I'm going, I'm going.

05:39.666 --> 05:40.833
What's up?

07:02.875 --> 07:04.083
-Hello.
-Hello.

07:05.458 --> 07:08.458
-Did you see his expression?
-Have you seen your body?

07:08.541 --> 07:11.583
Liana, we're busted.
Stop picking this kind of place.

07:11.666 --> 07:13.041
Are we doing this or what?

07:13.125 --> 07:16.458
It's not worth the risk of being arrested
over a few hundred bucks.

07:17.125 --> 07:19.041
Next time, find a smaller hotel.

07:19.916 --> 07:21.541
Or I'll get a job at McDonald's.

07:21.625 --> 07:24.041
Yeah, right. You obviously
never worked at McDonald's.

07:33.000 --> 07:33.833
You ready?

08:23.125 --> 08:24.125
Come in.

08:37.250 --> 08:38.916
Oh man, this is legit!

08:39.000 --> 08:40.750
It's insane.

08:40.833 --> 08:43.375
That is one beautiful building.

08:43.458 --> 08:46.708
We're doing four-course dining
tonight, man, you feel me?

08:49.458 --> 08:52.875
-You know what? I want to kiss you.
-Shh!

08:54.541 --> 08:55.375
Yes.

08:55.458 --> 08:56.916
Put your arms up here.

08:59.708 --> 09:03.166
You know, you're really hot.
You're making me hard.

09:09.666 --> 09:10.500
Hey, wait.

09:11.416 --> 09:12.708
Hey, what are you doing?

09:13.541 --> 09:15.333
-What are you doing?
-Hurry, come on!

09:16.375 --> 09:17.208
Here.

09:18.083 --> 09:19.958
Who are you? What are you doing?

09:20.041 --> 09:21.583
Who are you? Don't touch that.

09:21.666 --> 09:23.000
Hey, give that to me!

09:23.958 --> 09:26.750
You have no idea who I am, do you?

09:26.833 --> 09:28.125
Drop it!

09:36.583 --> 09:38.125
If you touch that bag, you're dead.

09:38.208 --> 09:41.291
I said stop!
You're dead too, you fucking whore!

09:41.375 --> 09:43.541
-What did you call her?
-A fucking whore!

09:44.708 --> 09:46.500
-What the--
-What are you doing? Leave it.

09:46.583 --> 09:48.000
Put it down.

09:48.083 --> 09:49.791
What are you doing?

09:49.875 --> 09:51.125
Bitch!

09:52.250 --> 09:54.250
Fucking bitch. I'll fuck you up!

09:55.166 --> 09:56.833
-Ciao!
-Bitch!

09:56.916 --> 09:58.375
Get back here! I'll kill you!

09:59.041 --> 10:00.958
I'll fucking kill you, bitch!

10:01.041 --> 10:02.083
You fucking whore!

10:13.625 --> 10:14.750
Fuck, it's coke!

10:16.250 --> 10:18.208
This wasn't part of the plan.

10:21.083 --> 10:22.208
Let's leave,

10:27.500 --> 10:29.541
This is heavy.
Whoo! We're going to be rich!

11:49.541 --> 11:51.208
You know what I'm going to do with mine?

11:51.291 --> 11:52.541
No. What's that?

11:52.625 --> 11:55.458
You know those brick walls
they have in New York City?

11:55.541 --> 11:56.375
Yeah?

11:56.458 --> 11:58.833
I'm doing the same in my restaurant.
But with gold bricks.

11:58.916 --> 12:01.458
-A $50 million wall?
-Yeah.

12:01.541 --> 12:04.791
Because that's what this is, huh?

12:05.541 --> 12:08.083
Well, guys, your gold is ready for you.

12:08.958 --> 12:10.083
Yeah.

12:12.666 --> 12:14.791
-Fuck me.
-Huh?

12:15.625 --> 12:16.666
Oh, fuck me.

12:33.833 --> 12:34.833
Hold on one sec.

12:34.916 --> 12:36.208
Hey, we cool?

12:38.583 --> 12:40.833
-I'm not holding onto this.
-What?

12:42.125 --> 12:43.166
You serious?

12:44.708 --> 12:45.708
Yeah, I'm serious.

12:47.166 --> 12:48.666
What?

12:48.750 --> 12:50.250
You wanna be stuck here, or what?

12:50.333 --> 12:53.166
-This isn't about that.
-Hey, stop dodging the question.

12:53.250 --> 12:55.666
Do you wanna leave? Yes or no.

12:55.750 --> 12:57.541
-Of course I do.
-Well, all right.

12:57.625 --> 12:58.750
But to do that we need cash.

12:59.333 --> 13:01.125
Look, I'm not selling drugs.

13:01.208 --> 13:04.125
Killing guys and all that, it's…

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
What's funny?

13:06.583 --> 13:08.291
Who are we killing?

13:08.375 --> 13:09.416
You're freaking out.

13:09.500 --> 13:12.458
It's simple. We'll give it to a guy,
and he'll wholesale it.

13:12.541 --> 13:14.500
Okay? Then we get the cash.

13:14.583 --> 13:17.291
And cash means playa,

13:17.375 --> 13:19.791
cocktails, you and I…

13:20.625 --> 13:24.583
Your body in all that hot sand…

13:24.666 --> 13:27.000
Massage!

13:28.166 --> 13:29.666
That's the life I'm choosing,

13:29.750 --> 13:30.666
and so are you.

13:30.750 --> 13:32.291
I don't want that money, okay?

13:32.375 --> 13:34.958
Come on! Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait.

13:35.541 --> 13:37.000
You're the worst.

13:37.083 --> 13:38.791
Stop looking at me like that.

13:38.875 --> 13:41.291
-You're the worst. Stop it!
-Or what?

13:58.375 --> 14:00.250
¡Te quiero, mami!

14:07.083 --> 14:07.916
Hey, Mom?

14:43.208 --> 14:45.958
Scattered showers
are expected along the Channel coast.

14:46.041 --> 14:48.958
Temperatures are still rather low
for this time of year. Today…

16:21.125 --> 16:22.250
Salaam alaikum.

16:24.416 --> 16:25.250
Salaam.

16:27.583 --> 16:30.000
Sorry to bother you.
I just feel like I see you

16:30.083 --> 16:31.708
every time that I'm in here.

16:32.291 --> 16:33.833
Do you come here a lot?

16:33.916 --> 16:35.083
Every day.

16:39.666 --> 16:40.875
That's your brother, isn't it?

16:41.708 --> 16:42.708
Hmm.

16:46.291 --> 16:49.708
And what happened to him,
if I may ask?

16:53.041 --> 16:54.750
I'd like to be alone now, please.

17:14.500 --> 17:17.791
Every time you and me know,
it's because Steph was there.

17:17.875 --> 17:19.791
Hey, man, listen. Come on.

17:19.875 --> 17:22.041
-It's time.
-Arm wrestle!

17:22.125 --> 17:23.666
Arm wrestle! Arm wrestle!

17:23.750 --> 17:25.625
Wait, man.

17:25.708 --> 17:28.416
It's all right. But first, clear the table
so we don't break anything.

17:28.500 --> 17:30.375
This is going to be awful, kids.
Close your eyes.

17:30.458 --> 17:33.000
All right!

17:33.083 --> 17:34.541
All right, see what you got.

17:34.625 --> 17:36.875
-I'm serious! Last time was the best.
-Stop it.

17:36.958 --> 17:38.250
Try not to break anything.

17:38.333 --> 17:41.125
-Come on.
-Let's go. Mehdi, you're the ref.

17:41.708 --> 17:42.708
No holding back, eh?

17:42.791 --> 17:45.041
-Anyone want to make a bet?
-My money's on you.

17:45.125 --> 17:47.333
Betting against your own brother?

17:47.416 --> 17:49.666
I'm betting on Arnaud, okay?
My money's on him.

17:49.750 --> 17:50.958
-You're betting on him?
-Right.

17:51.041 --> 17:53.583
Aw, come on, Dad! Come on, Dad!

17:53.666 --> 17:56.791
-My money's on Tony.
-Count us in, come on.

17:56.875 --> 17:59.333
Okay, three, two, one, yep!

18:06.583 --> 18:08.625
-What are you up to?
-Spilled some sauce on my shirt.

18:10.541 --> 18:11.958
Med, I swear.

18:12.041 --> 18:15.291
We just stole millions in gold,
and you worry about a $10 sweater.

18:15.375 --> 18:18.000
Ten bucks? You kidding?

18:21.750 --> 18:24.666
Hey, something weird happened
when we were in that tunnel earlier.

18:25.708 --> 18:27.875
This bullet flew past me, and suddenly…

18:31.041 --> 18:32.875
…I thought, "What the hell am I doing?"

18:33.458 --> 18:34.708
"Why am I here?"

18:34.791 --> 18:36.625
"If I die, what about my kids?"

18:38.791 --> 18:41.250
I never used to be bothered by any of it.

18:41.333 --> 18:42.666
If I died, I died.

18:42.750 --> 18:44.250
Woudn't matter. Fuck it.

18:44.833 --> 18:46.333
But now, I don't know. I've changed.

18:54.833 --> 18:55.666
I think I'm out.

18:56.250 --> 18:57.916
And I think you should be too.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
I mean, we're at the top. This is it.

19:03.833 --> 19:04.833
I love you, brother.

19:04.916 --> 19:06.666
Promise me you'll consider it.

19:09.791 --> 19:10.666
Okay.

19:23.291 --> 19:25.416
Modi,
you got a cousin who deals, right?

19:26.041 --> 19:27.750
-Yeah, so what?
-When can we see him?

19:28.333 --> 19:29.625
You're seriously gonna sell it?

19:29.708 --> 19:31.541
-Yeah, why not?
-Why not?

19:31.625 --> 19:33.083
Liana, we just robbed a guy.

19:33.166 --> 19:35.208
He's a Pablo Escobar.
Think he won't find us?

19:35.291 --> 19:37.625
All right, listen. When we make no money,
you whine about it.

19:37.708 --> 19:40.458
When we make money, you whine about it.
Pick a lane!

19:42.916 --> 19:44.541
Liana, he's right. We're not selling this.

19:44.625 --> 19:46.125
What do you mean, he's right?

19:46.208 --> 19:48.666
We should go tell the guy,
"Hey, man, here's your eight keys,

19:48.750 --> 19:50.291
we didn't mean to steal it"?

19:50.375 --> 19:52.708
Are you insane? Be realistic, man.

19:53.500 --> 19:56.458
-Modi, are you with me?
-I'm not with anyone. Stop yelling.

19:56.541 --> 19:57.625
I'm all about the cash.

19:57.708 --> 19:59.708
I know the dude my cousin deals for.

19:59.791 --> 20:02.333
He's legit.
We go to him, I know he won't talk.

20:02.416 --> 20:03.625
Now that's more like it.

20:05.375 --> 20:07.291
Do what you want. I don't give a shit.

20:07.375 --> 20:10.083
When you and I get a bullet to the head,
I don't want to hear about it.

20:12.083 --> 20:13.333
You really gonna do this?

20:13.916 --> 20:16.333
Yeah. Do you think he can handle
the eight keys or not?

20:16.416 --> 20:18.166
His business has been off the hook.

20:18.250 --> 20:19.833
I don't think it's gonna be an issue.

20:19.916 --> 20:21.083
Okay, so when are we going?

20:21.166 --> 20:22.458
Whenever you want.

20:23.250 --> 20:24.666
-Right now.
-Go!

20:38.625 --> 20:39.458
Are you good?

20:45.125 --> 20:46.500
They're waiting downstairs.

20:46.583 --> 20:47.625
Shall we, then?

20:54.625 --> 20:57.666
Congratulations. You're now the owners
of two office floors.

20:59.375 --> 21:00.916
I wouldn't be so quick to celebrate.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.958
If you don't find us tenants quickly,
we'll renegotiate your fees.

21:04.041 --> 21:07.416
Don't worry about that.
Give me one month, it'll be full.

21:07.500 --> 21:09.583
-How many square feet?
-Eight hundred.

21:10.166 --> 21:11.833
Four hundred here and 400 one floor down.

21:11.916 --> 21:14.708
Should I take care of the contracts
with a lawyer, or will you be there?

21:14.791 --> 21:16.125
I'll join you.

21:16.208 --> 21:19.083
Mm-hmm, excuse me. I need to take this.

21:19.916 --> 21:22.583
Yes, Sam. Mm-hmm…

21:22.666 --> 21:24.791
You have the same signature
as your dad.

21:25.375 --> 21:26.958
And what's he think about this?

21:27.583 --> 21:30.083
He thinks it's a good investment.
Money put to good use.

21:30.666 --> 21:31.750
For once, he likes it.

21:32.333 --> 21:34.000
He's not wrong. It's a nice building.

21:34.083 --> 21:36.708
We need to find more deals
like we did with this place.

21:36.791 --> 21:38.291
I have five garages.

21:38.375 --> 21:40.583
Isn't it enough
to launder the money we have?

21:41.500 --> 21:44.500
I'm not talking about laundering,
I'm talking about investments.

21:45.666 --> 21:48.166
Creating legal deals
to capitalize on what we have.

21:48.250 --> 21:50.916
I have my father's signature,
but you have his ideals.

21:51.500 --> 21:54.208
Saber, one day
you'll take your father's place.

21:55.125 --> 21:57.541
So you should think
about adopting his ideals too.

21:57.625 --> 21:58.916
Don't worry. I'll be ready.

22:00.166 --> 22:01.375
You'd better be.

22:02.541 --> 22:05.208
Because me being your cousin
won't stop me from kicking your ass.

22:05.291 --> 22:07.041
I'll be right back. One sec, okay?

22:14.458 --> 22:15.625
What's going on?

22:16.875 --> 22:18.250
The coke's been jacked.

22:18.875 --> 22:20.291
Fuck.

22:20.375 --> 22:21.625
All eight keys.

22:22.666 --> 22:23.583
What happened?

22:23.666 --> 22:25.750
Look, I was moving it to the safe house.

22:25.833 --> 22:28.500
But before I did,
I had this date with an escort girl.

22:29.500 --> 22:30.958
So, um, I went to see her…

22:32.875 --> 22:34.041
and then I was robbed.

22:34.125 --> 22:35.583
The escort robbed you?

22:37.000 --> 22:39.291
She wasn't alone. There was another girl.

22:40.250 --> 22:41.458
You think I care?

22:42.125 --> 22:44.583
Those whores have my coke.
Go find them and get it back.

22:45.500 --> 22:46.750
Understood?

22:46.833 --> 22:48.125
I have a plan.

22:51.250 --> 22:52.708
Wait for me downstairs.

22:56.750 --> 22:57.583
We good?

22:58.166 --> 23:00.375
-Need me for anything, or can I go?
-What did he want?

23:00.958 --> 23:02.166
Uh, nothing important.

23:02.833 --> 23:05.458
You two finish talking
about profitability. I'll call you.

23:24.750 --> 23:28.250
Good morning.

23:33.041 --> 23:34.250
You look like hell.

23:34.833 --> 23:36.833
Wow, Mom. First thing in the morning.

23:39.500 --> 23:41.000
Did you have problems falling asleep?

23:41.083 --> 23:42.000
No, just tired.

23:43.625 --> 23:46.791
-You want any eggs? Two?
-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

23:47.500 --> 23:50.291
Oh yeah, can you put some milk out
for the cat, please?

24:12.166 --> 24:13.166
Lefi!

24:21.125 --> 24:22.375
Lefi?

24:36.166 --> 24:37.125
Le--

24:44.666 --> 24:46.875
No, get the fuck away
from her!

24:49.500 --> 24:50.750
Shut the fuck up!

24:52.166 --> 24:53.958
-Shaïnez…
-We're taking the bitch with us.

24:54.041 --> 24:55.875
You'll get her back
when we get what's ours.

24:55.958 --> 24:57.666
Call the cops and she's dead!

25:22.750 --> 25:25.500
Is that thing
a dog or a shark?

25:25.583 --> 25:26.583
Damn.

25:43.500 --> 25:44.916
Your guy is not into it.

25:45.958 --> 25:46.875
Where'd you get it?

25:46.958 --> 25:48.833
Hey, that's not your problem, man.

25:48.916 --> 25:51.166
You see me asking you
how to wipe your ass?

25:51.250 --> 25:53.916
Nah. The coke's mine, and nobody else's.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.666
Now, we're either doing business
or I'm moving on. Which is it?

26:00.625 --> 26:02.291
-Look…
-What are you doing with that knife?

26:02.375 --> 26:04.875
Life's not some film. You cut it open,
you pay for it, buddy.

26:34.458 --> 26:36.875
I just want what you
and your friends stole from me.

26:36.958 --> 26:38.583
Then I promise you can go home.

26:40.416 --> 26:42.833
The cell phone you use
to call your girlfriend,

26:43.625 --> 26:44.875
where do you keep it?

26:44.958 --> 26:46.625
And what's the PIN to unlock it?

26:48.083 --> 26:48.916
15…

26:50.333 --> 26:52.000
03, 2011.

27:00.250 --> 27:01.208
Fuck…

27:05.000 --> 27:07.083
-What have you done now?
-What do you mean?

27:08.125 --> 27:11.041
Don't fuck with me, Mehdi.
Who has her?

27:11.125 --> 27:13.666
-What are you talking about?
-They've taken Shaïnez.

27:14.166 --> 27:17.000
-Who?
-Guys showed up at the house in masks.

27:17.750 --> 27:19.958
-Have you notified the police?
-No, I can't.

27:20.833 --> 27:22.458
They'll murder her if I do.

27:25.833 --> 27:28.000
Anissa, nobody knows
that you're my sister.

27:37.208 --> 27:40.041
My brother is here in his grave
because of what you did.

27:40.125 --> 27:43.666
You think you can come here every day
and just say a little prayer and…

27:45.375 --> 27:47.000
That doesn't change it!

27:49.541 --> 27:51.000
Don't touch me!

27:53.583 --> 27:56.708
For once, you need to take responsibility
for your mess.

27:56.791 --> 28:00.083
Go and find my child.

28:02.000 --> 28:02.833
Got that?

28:08.833 --> 28:09.833
Come on.

28:26.208 --> 28:27.875
-What's going on?
-Nothing!

28:29.166 --> 28:30.541
And now this fool.

28:30.625 --> 28:32.750
There's nothing in this shithole! Nothing!

28:35.958 --> 28:37.125
Just hats and cans…

28:37.208 --> 28:38.541
Where the fuck's the disinfectant?

28:39.125 --> 28:41.208
All we've got is some bread?
We don't have shit!

28:41.291 --> 28:44.208
-Where's the disinfectant?
-How would I know? What's going on?

28:44.291 --> 28:46.750
That motherfucker stole our coke,
all right? Look.

28:48.333 --> 28:49.333
What do you mean?

28:49.416 --> 28:51.416
What aren't you comprehending?
He took it.

28:51.500 --> 28:52.916
Man, you're a fucking moron!

28:53.000 --> 28:55.250
You had one job to do,
and you couldn't even do it right!

28:55.333 --> 28:57.833
-Why you yelling? It's not like--
-I'm yelling 'cause you lost it!

28:57.916 --> 28:59.833
You think I just let him take it
on purpose?

28:59.916 --> 29:02.291
-I don't give a fuck!
-I lost it. That what you want to hear?

29:02.375 --> 29:04.250
-Piss off!
-You think I planned this?

29:04.333 --> 29:05.458
I can't believe you!

29:05.541 --> 29:06.708
That I just gave him the coke?

29:06.791 --> 29:08.250
-Can't believe it.
-Can't?

29:08.333 --> 29:12.000
-Shut the fuck up!
-Why me? What the hell? Fuck!

29:38.333 --> 29:39.625
Her room's upstairs?

29:55.250 --> 29:58.208
I've already searched her things.
There's nothing to find.

30:28.291 --> 30:29.500
Stay here. I'll be back.

31:21.083 --> 31:23.041
That's… that's her travel card.

31:27.458 --> 31:29.208
Make this son of a bitch talk.

31:34.750 --> 31:36.208
Where'd you get this?

31:41.333 --> 31:42.541
My niece, where is she?

31:54.916 --> 31:57.625
Don't move! I said don't move!

31:58.333 --> 31:59.416
Don't move.

32:07.583 --> 32:08.416
Tie him up.

32:10.500 --> 32:12.041
Don't move. Be still.

32:14.291 --> 32:15.500
Don't move!

32:17.000 --> 32:18.666
-Shh!
-Okay, we're good.

32:43.708 --> 32:45.625
Hold his legs. Hold his legs.

33:03.375 --> 33:06.708
All right, all right! Hold on!

33:10.375 --> 33:12.208
Hold on! Just hold on, please.

33:12.291 --> 33:13.416
Tell me everything.

33:17.000 --> 33:18.750
-She was a prostitute.
-That's not true.

33:22.125 --> 33:23.875
That's what she was doing, I swear!

33:26.708 --> 33:28.833
Or at least that's why she was meeting me.

33:30.083 --> 33:31.833
She had me meet her in a hotel.

33:32.708 --> 33:34.541
Held me up with some other chick.

33:36.458 --> 33:37.333
What did they take?

33:39.125 --> 33:42.083
Eight kilos of coke.
I was bringing them to the warehouse.

33:46.541 --> 33:50.041
And the man you transport the coke for,
is he the one who took her?

33:55.875 --> 33:57.250
Is he the one who took her?

33:59.291 --> 34:00.125
Hmm?

34:00.958 --> 34:02.333
Did she tell him where she put it?

34:02.416 --> 34:03.583
Her girlfriend's keeping it.

34:05.500 --> 34:06.416
So why are you here?

34:07.333 --> 34:09.833
Apparently the girl with the coke
is a squatter.

34:09.916 --> 34:12.375
Your niece doesn't know
where she's crashing at the moment.

34:13.041 --> 34:16.666
But she has a phone. It's hidden here.
She only uses it to call her.

34:16.750 --> 34:20.375
It's the phone she has
for her phony escort business.

34:21.541 --> 34:23.083
You were here for the cell phone?

34:24.625 --> 34:25.541
Where is it?

34:27.375 --> 34:29.458
In her bedroom. In a stuffed animal.

34:32.250 --> 34:33.541
Here, hold it on him.

34:58.250 --> 35:00.708
The guy she ripped off,
can we pay him back?

35:00.791 --> 35:04.500
He doesn't care about cash.
It's about principle for him.

35:05.000 --> 35:07.625
What will happen if
he doesn't get his drugs back?

35:07.708 --> 35:09.458
I don't think you want to know.

35:16.583 --> 35:17.666
Don't move!

35:31.833 --> 35:32.666
What's the code?

35:33.541 --> 35:34.458
It's a date.

35:35.750 --> 35:37.166
15-03…

35:38.666 --> 35:39.625
2011.

35:40.333 --> 35:41.250
That's it.

36:03.666 --> 36:04.916
You got the phone?

36:06.208 --> 36:07.375
He doesn't, I'm afraid.

36:08.000 --> 36:09.083
Who are you?

36:09.166 --> 36:10.833
The guy who's gonna return your coke.

36:10.916 --> 36:13.500
-In exchange for the release of my niece.
-Your niece?

36:13.583 --> 36:15.958
You mean the girl
who pretends to be an escort?

36:16.541 --> 36:18.125
Where's the guy you took the phone from?

36:18.208 --> 36:19.416
He's busy.

36:19.500 --> 36:22.000
Think you're clever, don't you?

36:22.083 --> 36:23.875
How are you gonna find
what I'm looking for?

36:23.958 --> 36:24.791
Don't worry about it.

36:25.375 --> 36:26.750
Hey, listen to me, asshole!

36:27.541 --> 36:29.375
I'm warning you, don't fuck with me.

36:30.166 --> 36:32.000
I just need to get you back your coke.

36:32.083 --> 36:33.083
You got till tomorrow.

36:33.166 --> 36:36.333
If you don't have it to me by then,
I'll kill you and your entire family!

36:36.416 --> 36:38.750
Better not try to bring me
eight keys of someone else's shit!

36:38.833 --> 36:40.916
I better recognize my seal.
You got that, pal?

36:41.000 --> 36:42.750
Okay. For now, just put my niece on.

36:43.250 --> 36:44.166
She's busy too.

36:44.750 --> 36:45.666
Adios, uncle.

37:07.958 --> 37:09.000
Hey!

37:09.083 --> 37:10.291
Who's your uncle?

37:13.541 --> 37:14.791
Spit it out!

37:18.000 --> 37:19.916
Yo. How's it going, guys?

37:20.625 --> 37:21.875
Everything good?

37:21.958 --> 37:23.041
Hey, give me the usual, man.

37:23.125 --> 37:26.166
A kebab barbeque with Algerian sauce
and lettuce on it, please.

37:26.250 --> 37:30.083
Yo, I dig it! ¡Mexicano! ¡Hey, Mexicano!

37:30.166 --> 37:31.583
What's the matter with you?

37:31.666 --> 37:34.125
Smile a bit. Enjoy your life.
You're always in a bad mood.

37:34.208 --> 37:35.041
You sad or what?

37:35.625 --> 37:37.166
You want to chill for a bit?

37:37.250 --> 37:39.750
The king is back.

37:39.833 --> 37:42.125
I found a way to get the coke back,
so yeah.

37:43.500 --> 37:45.708
-How'd you do it?
-Well, my name's Modi.

37:45.791 --> 37:48.000
That's how I sorted it out.
Anyway, listen…

37:48.083 --> 37:49.583
When I first went to see that prick,

37:49.666 --> 37:52.125
I said the coke was mine,
so the prick stole it.

37:52.208 --> 37:54.416
But I called him back,
said the coke wasn't mine,

37:54.500 --> 37:56.291
but some guy from Antwerp's instead.

37:56.375 --> 37:59.041
Man, I spun it
like I was in the fucking mafia,

37:59.125 --> 38:02.583
and I swear that shithead pissed himself.
It's all good now.

38:03.083 --> 38:04.541
Finito. Back in the game, baby.

38:05.166 --> 38:06.416
You went back to see this guy

38:06.500 --> 38:09.250
with this thing you made up,
and he just gave you the eight keys back?

38:09.333 --> 38:11.791
A bit of acting, a bit of bluffing…

38:11.875 --> 38:13.250
-That's it.
-When do we get it?

38:13.333 --> 38:15.791
Liana, there's no need
to worry about it anymore.

38:15.875 --> 38:17.208
He's gonna bring the dope to us.

38:17.291 --> 38:18.458
What are you, an idiot?

38:18.541 --> 38:19.791
He's taking it directly to us?

38:19.875 --> 38:22.333
I'm not gonna go walking around
with eight keys.

38:22.416 --> 38:23.750
You want to get busted?

38:23.833 --> 38:26.625
He's bringing it to us.
It's safer, that's all. Hey…

38:27.208 --> 38:29.125
Did I handle that, or did I handle that?

38:29.208 --> 38:30.041
Not bad.

38:30.125 --> 38:32.833
No, wait, I didn't catch that.
Did I handle that or what?

38:32.916 --> 38:33.875
Well, we'll see, right?

38:33.958 --> 38:35.750
Did you hear me?
We're gonna make bucks.

38:35.833 --> 38:38.666
Money, xaalis, dollars, the wari.

38:38.750 --> 38:41.125
Come on, eat your fries.
Life is beautiful!

38:48.666 --> 38:49.541
Here.

38:51.541 --> 38:53.166
Come back here and you're dead.

38:54.416 --> 38:55.375
Okay?

38:56.958 --> 38:57.916
Get out of here.

39:15.041 --> 39:17.375
Get your things.
You're staying at my place.

39:32.333 --> 39:34.333
SUCH A HOTTIE!

39:50.291 --> 39:54.166
-Where is your place exactly?
-It's completely isolated. You'll be safe.

39:54.250 --> 39:55.250
Here, this is it.

39:55.333 --> 39:57.041
-Okay.
-At the end of the path.

39:57.875 --> 39:59.333
-Here.
-Okay.

40:00.875 --> 40:02.791
I'll call you when I find the coke.

40:52.625 --> 40:53.625
Keep walking.

41:27.833 --> 41:30.416
Next time, spare me
the dramatics, if that's all right.

41:30.916 --> 41:31.791
What do you mean?

41:31.875 --> 41:33.041
You know what I mean.

41:33.958 --> 41:36.583
And those girls
probably shouldn't have seen my face.

41:37.291 --> 41:38.708
Why did you want to see me?

41:38.791 --> 41:43.583
Your cousin. Seems he's started selling
his shit product in Antwerp again.

41:44.541 --> 41:45.625
This is my territory.

41:45.708 --> 41:48.666
You promised it wouldn't happen again,
so I need to talk to your uncle.

41:49.208 --> 41:50.041
No.

41:50.125 --> 41:52.541
No. That won't fly.

41:53.166 --> 41:54.791
Either your uncle talks to me,

41:54.875 --> 41:56.750
or he can find another port
to move his coke.

41:58.125 --> 41:59.041
Chris…

42:00.458 --> 42:02.541
you know we have to move it
through Antwerp.

42:02.625 --> 42:03.958
Our suppliers insisted.

42:05.750 --> 42:06.708
Let me handle this.

42:10.625 --> 42:11.875
So your uncle doesn't know.

42:13.833 --> 42:17.458
You didn't tell him about the first time
Saber was dealing his coke here?

42:22.916 --> 42:25.958
Why do you let that prick
completely ruin everything for you?

42:29.875 --> 42:31.875
If I were you, I'd watch my tongue.

42:33.750 --> 42:35.375
Okay. I'll call my uncle.

42:42.958 --> 42:46.458
I'm gonna give you one last chance
to handle this. You and your uncle.

42:46.541 --> 42:50.250
But first,
I'll need you to do me a small favor.

43:24.416 --> 43:26.041
I know he's got more than eight keys.

43:26.125 --> 43:27.458
He thought he could screw us.

43:28.708 --> 43:30.208
I'll beat the shit out of those pricks.

43:44.500 --> 43:45.416
Where are my smokes?

43:46.083 --> 43:47.500
-What?
-My cigarettes.

43:47.583 --> 43:49.041
I don't know. Maybe on the table.

43:50.750 --> 43:52.583
Like this, bam! See?

44:00.958 --> 44:03.291
What are you doing?
Liana, you're blocking the TV.

44:03.375 --> 44:05.208
-Where should I go?
-You're not even trying.

44:05.291 --> 44:07.291
Is there another way I can go? No.

44:07.375 --> 44:08.958
You're gonna make me fuck up, I swear.

44:24.875 --> 44:25.791
Whatever.

44:25.875 --> 44:27.625
Don't stand in front of the TV.

44:34.875 --> 44:37.916
-I'm always cleaning up after you!
-Come on, Liana, I'm playing!

44:38.000 --> 44:39.916
So what? You can pause it for 10 seconds.

44:41.125 --> 44:43.125
-You don't have the touch.
-What?

44:43.208 --> 44:44.958
Guys, get in here.

44:45.041 --> 44:46.250
Or you'll get kicked.

44:46.333 --> 44:48.916
You say you want to play,
then you just dick around.

44:49.000 --> 44:50.500
-No one's gonna help me?
-Lay off.

44:50.583 --> 44:51.583
You serious?

44:51.666 --> 44:53.041
You two have no talent.

44:53.125 --> 44:54.458
Modi, come on, move.

44:54.541 --> 44:56.000
Liana, can you move, please?

44:56.083 --> 44:57.666
-Let us play.
-Fuck you.

44:57.750 --> 44:59.000
Fine, smart asses.

44:59.083 --> 45:01.083
-Go on.
-You'll regret it, I promise.

45:01.166 --> 45:03.083
-No, that's it.
-Come on. Stop whining.

45:15.458 --> 45:18.333
-There, in the sky, bitches!
-Ah, hurry!

45:22.291 --> 45:24.583
-Take that!
-You're killing me!

45:24.666 --> 45:26.625
I can do this with one hand.
I mean, try a little.

45:26.708 --> 45:29.625
It's this stupid controller.
I'm pressing it, but it's not working.

45:43.291 --> 45:45.750
Where's the coke
you and Shaïnez took?

45:45.833 --> 45:50.166
I don't know.
