00:03.568 --> 00:06.223
Next up, the People
v. John Gorman.

00:06.223 --> 00:08.138
Mr. Gorman is charged
with larceny theft

00:08.138 --> 00:09.661
for a purse snatching.

00:09.661 --> 00:12.403
Uh, Your Honor,
this alleged crime is so quaint,

00:12.403 --> 00:14.057
it's actually charming.

00:14.057 --> 00:16.190
It's an homage
to a simpler time,

00:16.190 --> 00:19.367
when people had the decency
to rob you to your face,

00:19.367 --> 00:22.718
when a street urchin could pick
your pocket and warm your heart,

00:22.718 --> 00:24.807
often within the same song.

00:24.807 --> 00:28.115
Objection.
Hot nonsense.

00:28.115 --> 00:29.420
Sustained.

00:29.420 --> 00:31.770
The State has a witness,
Your Honor.

00:31.770 --> 00:34.556
Would you mind describing
what you saw, please?

00:34.556 --> 00:36.645
It's a crisp autumn day.

00:36.645 --> 00:39.343
A blur of a man
races by a street vendor

00:39.343 --> 00:41.128
selling daffodils.

00:41.128 --> 00:44.131
Behind me, a cry rings out--
"My bag!

00:44.131 --> 00:46.698
He stole my bag!"

00:46.698 --> 00:49.397
The city feels nothing.

00:49.397 --> 00:53.357
Would the counsel
please approach the bench?

00:53.357 --> 00:56.795
Permission to treat
the witness like a nut bar?

00:56.795 --> 00:58.449
- Don't you know who that is?
- Mm?

00:58.449 --> 01:00.538
That's Remecca Monte-Pulciano.

01:00.538 --> 01:02.192
She hosts this podcast
that I love,

01:02.192 --> 01:03.976
"The Social Archaeologist."

01:03.976 --> 01:05.456
I'm not a fan of podcasts.

01:05.456 --> 01:06.892
I'm an audiobook gal.

01:06.892 --> 01:08.546
I'm in the middle
of Matthew McConaughey's.

01:08.546 --> 01:10.200
Tomorrow,
I'm gonna hit you with an--

01:10.200 --> 01:13.247
"All rise, all rise, all rise."

01:13.247 --> 01:15.162
This one focuses
on everyday people

01:15.162 --> 01:17.642
and digs deep into
what makes them inspirational.

01:17.642 --> 01:18.904
I'm almost positive it's her.

01:18.904 --> 01:20.471
There's only one way
to find out.

01:20.471 --> 01:22.778
Would the witness
please say the phrase,

01:22.778 --> 01:25.172
"Here is your
Wisdom-Out Wednesday"?

01:25.172 --> 01:28.000
Here is your
Wisdom-Out Wednesday.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.741
Oh-ho! It <i>is</i> her!

01:29.741 --> 01:32.701
I finally got to see her mouth
move while she says it.

01:32.701 --> 01:36.008
Now that we've achieved all
our dreams, only death awaits.

01:36.008 --> 01:38.054
Wait, where's the defendant?

01:38.054 --> 01:39.534
And where's my purse?

01:39.534 --> 01:41.449
Oh, did anyone see
what happened?

01:41.449 --> 01:43.929
There was an echo of worn soles

01:43.929 --> 01:45.888
on cracked linoleum,

01:45.888 --> 01:49.674
and then a flash
of fake HermÃ¨s orange.

01:49.674 --> 01:53.069
And for no reason at all,
shade was thrown.

02:09.738 --> 02:11.566
And speak your truth

02:11.566 --> 02:13.002
after the beep.

02:13.002 --> 02:14.917
Oh! That was amazing.

02:14.917 --> 02:16.832
Now I'm even more excited
for my dental appointment

02:16.832 --> 02:18.964
to get confirmed tomorrow.

02:18.964 --> 02:21.967
But actually, there is another
reason I asked you to stay.

02:21.967 --> 02:25.275
The truth is, I do have an idea
for your podcast.

02:25.275 --> 02:29.845
It's about this court and our
empathetic approach to justice.

02:29.845 --> 02:32.108
And look who happens to be here.

02:32.108 --> 02:34.937
The dedicated heroes
who make it happen.

02:34.937 --> 02:39.115
When I'm being ambushed,
I expect pastries.

02:39.115 --> 02:42.074
Well, as an archaeologist,
I always have my fossil brush

02:42.074 --> 02:44.773
and my pickaxe,
so I might as well stick around

02:44.773 --> 02:46.557
and see what's
under this pile of dirt.

02:46.557 --> 02:47.906
Hear that, guys?

02:47.906 --> 02:49.908
We're gonna get brushed
and picked.

02:49.908 --> 02:51.606
Hi. I'm Neil.

02:51.606 --> 02:53.782
You know, I've thought about
doing a podcast myself.

02:53.782 --> 02:56.045
It's called "The Neil World,"

02:56.045 --> 02:59.657
where I stop being polite
and start being Neil.

02:59.657 --> 03:02.791
And what precisely is
"being Neil"?

03:02.791 --> 03:04.836
It's being polite
and constantly asking me

03:04.836 --> 03:07.752
if he should get an earring.

03:07.752 --> 03:09.841
Olivia Moore,
assistant district attorney.

03:09.841 --> 03:11.365
You know, I think having me

03:11.365 --> 03:13.367
on your podcast
could build both our brands.

03:13.367 --> 03:14.759
- Is that right?
- Mm-hmm.

03:14.759 --> 03:16.283
From the time
I was a little girl,

03:16.283 --> 03:17.806
I knew that a career in law

03:17.806 --> 03:20.896
would fit me like
a pair of MeUndies.

03:20.896 --> 03:22.376
They sure changed my life.

03:22.376 --> 03:25.727
Thanks, MeUndies.

03:25.727 --> 03:27.250
So, there's that.

03:27.250 --> 03:29.948
Um, and then someone
who would offer you

03:29.948 --> 03:31.820
a shorter introduction.

03:31.820 --> 03:32.995
Dan Fielding.

03:32.995 --> 03:34.431
- No.
- Ha-ha!

03:34.431 --> 03:36.259
That's my guy.

03:36.259 --> 03:39.044
Dan actually used to be the
prosecutor at this very court,

03:39.044 --> 03:40.132
and then he came
out of retirement

03:40.132 --> 03:41.699
to be our public defender.

03:41.699 --> 03:44.789
Now, there's a journey
I'd like to excavate.

03:44.789 --> 03:46.226
That's her tagline.

03:46.226 --> 03:48.706
Hear that, Dan?
You're tagline-worthy.

03:48.706 --> 03:50.360
She want to dig
a hole in a journey?

03:50.360 --> 03:52.884
The hell sense that make?

03:52.884 --> 03:56.888
No offense, but podcasts for me
fall under the same category

03:56.888 --> 04:00.022
as energy drinks, reality TV,

04:00.022 --> 04:04.156
and something called
"Guy Fieri."

04:04.156 --> 04:06.158
Why?

04:06.158 --> 04:08.073
Some people just don't
like the idea

04:08.073 --> 04:10.162
of spending
two uninterrupted hours

04:10.162 --> 04:13.862
talking about themselves
to an audience of millions.

04:13.862 --> 04:17.213
Well, don't lump me in
with those idiots.

04:17.213 --> 04:19.259
I'd be happy to offer
my services.

04:19.259 --> 04:20.782
Oh. Right.

04:20.782 --> 04:23.001
So, you'd just use Dan
as, like, an appetizer

04:23.001 --> 04:24.873
to get into the bigger
night court story?

04:24.873 --> 04:26.788
Abby, the lady
just ordered steak.

04:26.788 --> 04:29.878
Don't try to sell her
a used Datsun.

04:29.878 --> 04:31.532
So, we're all just
mixing metaphors now?

04:31.532 --> 04:33.490
I mean, what are we even
doing here?

04:36.711 --> 04:41.455
Is Dan Fielding's rise
from humble beginnings

04:41.455 --> 04:45.067
to the top of the bottom
of the judicial system

04:45.067 --> 04:47.765
one of our generation's
most remarkable feats?

04:47.765 --> 04:50.638
It is not for me to say.

04:50.638 --> 04:53.423
But it is my pleasure to repeat.

04:53.423 --> 04:56.165
Perhaps we should just focus
on your transition

04:56.165 --> 04:57.427
to public defender.

04:57.427 --> 04:58.602
We'll get to that.

04:58.602 --> 05:01.736
It was William Jennings Bryan

05:01.736 --> 05:04.739
who said that service is
a measure of a man's greatness.

05:04.739 --> 05:07.916
I think that a man's greatness
is decided

05:07.916 --> 05:10.005
by how many awards he gets.

05:10.005 --> 05:14.488
And mine range from runner-up
in the city council election

05:14.488 --> 05:16.403
all the way back
to my eighth grade

05:16.403 --> 05:18.274
state spelling bee championship

05:18.274 --> 05:20.711
honorable mention.

05:20.711 --> 05:23.453
Actually, uh,
can we talk about that?

05:23.453 --> 05:24.715
Yes, yes.

05:24.715 --> 05:27.283
And therein began
a lifelong disdain

05:27.283 --> 05:28.763
for the silent "G."

05:28.763 --> 05:30.286
No, no, no, no.

05:30.286 --> 05:32.767
Uh, I'm talking about your run
for city council.

05:32.767 --> 05:36.423
Now, according to my research,
you ran as an independent,

05:36.423 --> 05:38.468
and your opponent
was a "D"?

05:38.468 --> 05:39.687
For Democrat?

05:39.687 --> 05:40.731
D...

05:40.731 --> 05:43.212
ceased.

05:43.212 --> 05:46.824
Yes, I lost to a dead man.

05:46.824 --> 05:49.871
But I was the highest
living vote-getter,

05:49.871 --> 05:52.308
and I seriously believe
I would have won

05:52.308 --> 05:56.138
had I handed out 20s
instead of 10s.

05:56.138 --> 05:58.619
You were trying to buy
people's votes?

05:58.619 --> 06:00.925
You have to really understand
the time.

06:00.925 --> 06:02.666
It was New York in the '80s.

06:02.666 --> 06:05.582
It was very, very difficult
to get people out to vote.

06:05.582 --> 06:09.456
There were--
There were other things to do.

06:09.456 --> 06:11.371
Like cocaine.

06:14.025 --> 06:16.724
And Pac-Man had just come out,

06:16.724 --> 06:21.729
and that was the perfect surface
to do cocaine off of.

06:21.729 --> 06:24.427
Still, sounds to me
like a crime.

06:24.427 --> 06:25.733
Yeah, no, no.

06:25.733 --> 06:28.170
You have to understand
the context.

06:28.170 --> 06:31.303
I'm listening.

06:32.566 --> 06:33.828
Oh, no.

06:33.828 --> 06:36.787
Did I swallow a "g-nat"?

06:36.787 --> 06:39.399
Oh, also, did I--
I'm not Dan!

06:39.399 --> 06:40.661
No, no, no.

06:40.661 --> 06:42.489
I'm his--
I'm his brother, August.

06:42.489 --> 06:44.360
I'll go get him.
I'll just go get him.

06:44.360 --> 06:45.883
Stay right there.
Keep rolling.

06:45.883 --> 06:47.407
It's okay.

06:53.935 --> 06:55.415
Oh, Dan, good.

06:55.415 --> 06:56.851
I need your opinion
on something.

06:56.851 --> 06:58.200
I've been listening to my voice,

06:58.200 --> 06:59.941
and is this really
what I sound like?

06:59.941 --> 07:01.769
<i>Four score and seven years ago,</i>

07:01.769 --> 07:04.032
<i>our forefathers brought forth
on this continent--</i>

07:04.032 --> 07:06.251
Right, I think you're
playing it at double the--

07:06.251 --> 07:09.298
No, that's exactly what
you sound like in my head.

07:09.298 --> 07:10.734
Why are you listening
to yourself?

07:10.734 --> 07:12.214
Well, after your interview,

07:12.214 --> 07:13.650
Remecca reached out
to me to do one.

07:13.650 --> 07:15.957
I'm so excited.

07:15.957 --> 07:17.262
No, no.
Listen to me.

07:17.262 --> 07:18.655
You can't do the interview.

07:18.655 --> 07:20.135
As a matter of fact,
you have to bar

07:20.135 --> 07:22.006
that podcast crew
from the courthouse.

07:22.006 --> 07:23.443
Why would I do that?

07:23.443 --> 07:26.054
When I was listing
my many accomplishments,

07:26.054 --> 07:31.276
I may have implicated myself
in just a smidge of malfeasance.

07:31.276 --> 07:34.454
I started talking
about cocaine a lot.

07:34.454 --> 07:36.368
Now Remecca's out
to take me down.

07:36.368 --> 07:38.109
Maybe if you talked
about the court

07:38.109 --> 07:40.285
instead of being so selfish,
you wouldn't be in trouble.

07:40.285 --> 07:41.939
But you need the whole world
to know

07:41.939 --> 07:44.028
about that spelling bee,
don't you?

07:44.028 --> 07:45.900
It's an origin story.

07:45.900 --> 07:47.379
Well, I'm gonna go in there

07:47.379 --> 07:49.251
and talk about the work
we're doing here,

07:49.251 --> 07:52.254
and maybe it will inspire other
courts to follow our example.

07:52.254 --> 07:54.909
I'm not gonna lose that chance
just because you biffed it.

07:54.909 --> 07:56.824
I'm telling you, it's a trap.

07:56.824 --> 08:00.567
She tricked <i>me</i>-- Dan.

08:00.567 --> 08:02.569
Dan!

08:03.744 --> 08:05.789
You're not gonna
change my mind.

08:05.789 --> 08:07.312
Yeah, alright, fine,
fine, yeah.

08:07.312 --> 08:08.879
But when it doesn't work,
just be ready to hear

08:08.879 --> 08:11.142
the five words
that everyone dreads--

08:11.142 --> 08:12.709
"I told you so."

08:12.709 --> 08:15.233
- That's four words.
- Well, I'm counting

08:15.233 --> 08:17.671
the raucous laughter
before I say it

08:17.671 --> 08:19.586
as a word.

08:19.586 --> 08:21.805
Matter of fact, I'm gonna
start practicing it now.

08:21.805 --> 08:23.546
Ha!

08:24.982 --> 08:26.636
Ha-wah-hah!

08:26.636 --> 08:27.898
I...

08:27.898 --> 08:29.900
No, wait.
Hee-hee!

08:31.511 --> 08:33.556
I cracked the case,
and now I'll crack

08:33.556 --> 08:35.123
the most up-to-date
point spreads,

08:35.123 --> 08:36.646
with Offshore Bet Boys.

08:36.646 --> 08:39.431
It's not gambling
when they're stone-cold locks.

08:42.522 --> 08:44.959
I've never seen someone
so thirsty to get on a podcast.

08:44.959 --> 08:47.439
And I have several friends
whose spouses went missing

08:47.439 --> 08:49.877
after joining a cult.

08:49.877 --> 08:52.140
It's all part of my
media strategy.

08:52.140 --> 08:54.359
First step, podcasts.

08:54.359 --> 08:57.101
Second step,
TikTok legal influencer.

08:57.101 --> 08:59.843
Third step, Whoopi yells
at the wrong Uber driver,

08:59.843 --> 09:03.586
and bingo, mama's
batting cleanup on "The View."

09:03.586 --> 09:05.849
But I can't get Remecca
to even look at me.

09:05.849 --> 09:07.242
I feel like Neil.
- Hey!

09:07.242 --> 09:10.071
- Whoa!
- Don't sneak up on people!

09:10.071 --> 09:12.160
I've been trying to get
Remecca's attention, too.

09:12.160 --> 09:15.032
The problem is
she is all-in on Dan.

09:15.032 --> 09:16.686
Don't take this the wrong way,

09:16.686 --> 09:18.340
but you all are boring.

09:18.340 --> 09:20.211
You need to sell the drama.

09:20.211 --> 09:22.126
May I suggest...

09:22.126 --> 09:24.259
a forbidden office romance?

09:24.259 --> 09:25.521
With me and him?

09:25.521 --> 09:27.436
No.

09:27.436 --> 09:32.006
Look, podcasts are for lonely
people who don't like music.

09:32.006 --> 09:34.312
But you know
what lonely people <i>do</i> like?

09:34.312 --> 09:36.271
I feel like
I should know this.

09:36.271 --> 09:39.056
Murder and romance,
and since you've made it clear

09:39.056 --> 09:41.363
on multiple occasions
that you're a stick in the mud

09:41.363 --> 09:45.062
when it comes to murder,
I'd go with...

09:45.062 --> 09:47.499
secret work love!

09:47.499 --> 09:48.979
Did you see that?

09:48.979 --> 09:50.677
That's the first time
she's looked at me.

09:50.677 --> 09:52.940
That's it.
Neil, we're in a relationship.

09:52.940 --> 09:54.419
"Pretty Woman" rules.

09:54.419 --> 09:56.204
No kissing, and it'll be
mostly me hanging out

09:56.204 --> 09:57.945
with Hector Elizondo.

10:01.905 --> 10:04.952
That is very funny.

10:04.952 --> 10:07.911
I am laughing.

10:07.911 --> 10:10.522
And please, let Donatello know
that I will be bringing

10:10.522 --> 10:13.308
the haricots verts
to Sunday's dish-to-pass.

10:13.308 --> 10:14.570
Ah!

10:14.570 --> 10:16.572
You're from Skaneateles,
aren't you?

10:16.572 --> 10:18.008
- How did you--
- That's where I'm from.

10:18.008 --> 10:19.923
It's the only place
I've ever heard it called

10:19.923 --> 10:21.316
a "dish-to-pass."

10:21.316 --> 10:24.101
Everywhere else,
they call it a potluck.

10:24.101 --> 10:26.277
I mean,
like a damn leprechaun

10:26.277 --> 10:28.497
supremed all those oranges
for that citrus salad?

10:28.497 --> 10:31.239
"Luck," my butt.

10:31.239 --> 10:33.502
- So, shall we start?
- Sure, sure.

10:33.502 --> 10:34.982
Hi. I'm Abby.

10:34.982 --> 10:36.636
Would you like to take a seat?
- No, no, no, no.

10:36.636 --> 10:38.594
Just pretend like
he's not even there.

10:38.594 --> 10:42.163
This is just a conversation.

10:42.163 --> 10:44.905
Why don't we begin with,
how have you found

10:44.905 --> 10:46.994
working with Dan Fielding?

10:46.994 --> 10:49.692
I have no regrets about
bringing Dan to this court.

10:49.692 --> 10:52.173
My father always said there was
no one he respected more,

10:52.173 --> 10:54.044
and you know,
I feel like we're missing

10:54.044 --> 10:56.525
a bigger story here--
- So, y-you found Mr. Fielding

10:56.525 --> 10:58.788
through a good ol' boy network?

10:58.788 --> 11:00.485
There's more to it than that.

11:00.485 --> 11:02.487
Because it sounds like
you manipulated the system

11:02.487 --> 11:04.751
to help out one
of your father's old buddies.

11:05.926 --> 11:09.059
Are these chairs
getting smaller?

11:09.059 --> 11:10.974
It is hot out in here.

11:13.498 --> 11:14.761
Gah!

11:22.986 --> 11:24.684
- What's this?
- It's everything you need

11:24.684 --> 11:26.860
to know
about our fake relationship.

11:26.860 --> 11:28.383
What?
If we're gonna make this work,

11:28.383 --> 11:31.299
we need to make it seem
as real as possible.

11:31.299 --> 11:33.736
Good thinking, babe.

11:33.736 --> 11:35.520
You will immediately see
on page one that

11:35.520 --> 11:37.044
we are not a "babe" couple.

11:37.044 --> 11:40.047
You'll find approved nicknames
on page three.

11:40.047 --> 11:42.614
These are just <i>our</i> names.

11:42.614 --> 11:45.661
Yeah.
I came up with those.

11:45.661 --> 11:48.185
Feel free to add
whatever your last name is.

11:51.493 --> 11:53.887
Alright, well,
there's a lot in here covering

11:53.887 --> 11:57.629
how I'm supposed to feel about
everyone on "Vanderpump Rules,"

11:57.629 --> 11:59.457
but nothing about
where we are emotionally.

11:59.457 --> 12:00.937
Like, how serious are we?

12:00.937 --> 12:03.244
Where is this relationship
going?

12:03.244 --> 12:05.550
Where is this coming from?

12:05.550 --> 12:07.857
Well, if I'm gonna be
your fake boyfriend--

12:07.857 --> 12:10.599
Boyfriend? Whoa! Okay.

12:10.599 --> 12:12.427
Save those labels
for the runway, mister.

12:12.427 --> 12:13.950
Ha!

12:13.950 --> 12:16.866
Next, you're gonna tell me
you're pregnant.

12:16.866 --> 12:19.216
Guess what?
You are raising that baby alone.

12:22.437 --> 12:24.134
Dan, I messed up.
I messed up bad.

12:24.134 --> 12:25.788
The interview backfired.

12:25.788 --> 12:27.442
I sorta let it slip

12:27.442 --> 12:30.227
that I may have shortcut
a few rules when I hired you,

12:30.227 --> 12:31.881
and now Remecca wants
to take me down, too.

12:31.881 --> 12:33.317
What happened?

12:33.317 --> 12:34.666
You mess things up
with the podcast lady?

12:34.666 --> 12:36.320
- Yeah.
- How bad is it?

12:36.320 --> 12:38.496
Well, I pulled out an,
"It was a different time."

12:38.496 --> 12:40.629
Okay.

12:40.629 --> 12:43.806
So, we're in some trouble.
- Why is that bad?

12:43.806 --> 12:46.504
Three phrases you don't use
in problematic situations--

12:46.504 --> 12:47.984
"It was a different time."

12:47.984 --> 12:49.681
"I meant it as a joke".

12:49.681 --> 12:52.032
And "I know it's not okay
to say, but..."

12:52.032 --> 12:54.164
Just don't say it!

12:54.164 --> 12:57.777
I can't believe they don't teach
that in white people school.

12:57.777 --> 13:00.083
To be fair, there's not
really an official white--

13:00.083 --> 13:01.606
Dartmouth.

13:04.087 --> 13:06.350
Okay, look, I'm just
gonna talk to Remecca.

13:06.350 --> 13:08.004
I mean, I'm sure if I just
sit down with her,

13:08.004 --> 13:10.137
one Skaneatelan to another,
we can sort this out.

13:10.137 --> 13:12.313
I mean, we grew up playing
in the same parks.

13:12.313 --> 13:13.662
I'm sure she even has a theory

13:13.662 --> 13:15.620
on what happened
to Billy Muggins.

13:17.535 --> 13:20.800
You know, maybe Abby
<i>can</i> convince her.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.497
Yeah, no, no.
I got a better idea.

13:22.497 --> 13:24.760
I got three better ideas.

13:24.760 --> 13:27.415
It can't involve wigs.

13:27.415 --> 13:29.243
Okay, we'll go with yours.

13:29.243 --> 13:30.592
Come on.

13:35.075 --> 13:36.772
Wow.

13:36.772 --> 13:39.166
Well, I just hope this thing
is still down here.

13:39.166 --> 13:42.343
And listen, remember, Abby
cannot know what we're doing.

13:42.343 --> 13:44.562
She needs plausible deniability.

13:44.562 --> 13:46.651
I get it.
Everybody needs a cover story.

13:46.651 --> 13:49.176
That's why I keep
a cardboard cutout of me waving

13:49.176 --> 13:51.743
in that bowling alley bathroom.

13:51.743 --> 13:53.615
"Where was Gurgs
the night in question?"

13:53.615 --> 13:56.792
"She was in that bowling alley
bathroom being super friendly."

14:02.102 --> 14:03.799
Oh, you know what?
I think...

14:06.019 --> 14:07.411
Uh-huh. Yeah!

14:07.411 --> 14:09.326
This is it!

14:09.326 --> 14:11.546
I don't get it.
How is some old metal detector

14:11.546 --> 14:13.548
gonna solve things
with the podcast lady?

14:13.548 --> 14:16.464
This is not just
some old metal detector.

14:16.464 --> 14:19.641
We called it "Meg Ryan,"
'cause prolonged exposure

14:19.641 --> 14:22.557
was known
to melt people's hearts.

14:22.557 --> 14:24.994
More importantly for us, though,
the magnets in this thing--

14:24.994 --> 14:27.214
they'll fry any electrical
equipment it comes near.

14:27.214 --> 14:29.346
It'll just erase everything.

14:29.346 --> 14:30.870
Brilliant, huh?

14:32.959 --> 14:34.874
This is where I keep my spare.

14:41.010 --> 14:43.926
Alright, I am all set
for my chat with Remecca.

14:43.926 --> 14:46.711
I imported loganberry pop,
some white hots,

14:46.711 --> 14:49.323
all of the finest
Skaneateles delicacies.

14:49.323 --> 14:51.064
White hot dogs?

14:53.457 --> 14:56.939
"Delicacy" may not be
the right word.

14:56.939 --> 15:00.508
"Food" may not be
the right word.

15:00.508 --> 15:02.858
What is that, and why
is it making my teeth hurt?

15:02.858 --> 15:05.252
Oh, just some extra security.

15:05.252 --> 15:07.384
I know upstate you just throw
some tacks on the floor,

15:07.384 --> 15:11.562
but here in the big city,
we wear shoes.

15:11.562 --> 15:13.216
Is that warning in Russian?

15:13.216 --> 15:15.523
- Oh, no--
<i>- Nyet!</i>

15:15.523 --> 15:16.916
I knew something was weird.

15:16.916 --> 15:18.830
What is going on?
- It was Dan's idea.

15:18.830 --> 15:22.225
I was in the bowling alley bathroom.

15:22.225 --> 15:24.662
Alright, look, the only way
to fix this is to get her

15:24.662 --> 15:26.708
to walk through that machine

15:26.708 --> 15:28.971
and erase everything
that she has on us.

15:28.971 --> 15:30.581
There's no way
that thing is safe.

15:30.581 --> 15:32.061
It is definitely safe.

15:32.061 --> 15:34.759
And I remind you,
I am not under oath.

15:34.759 --> 15:36.196
Why are you so annoyed?

15:36.196 --> 15:38.024
All I asked is
if you were mad at me.

15:38.024 --> 15:40.722
Oh, you prob-- Mm.

15:40.722 --> 15:43.203
Neil, sometimes my mood
has nothing to do with you.

15:43.203 --> 15:44.769
Oh, you were driving me
so crazy,

15:44.769 --> 15:46.728
I left my bag in the cafeteria.

15:46.728 --> 15:48.382
Actually, I have your bag
right here,

15:48.382 --> 15:50.645
because <i>I</i> think about you.

15:50.645 --> 15:52.777
Oh, my hero.

15:52.777 --> 15:54.649
I'd be so lost without you.

15:54.649 --> 15:57.043
Oh, there it is.
Your sarcasm.

15:57.043 --> 15:58.958
The third wheel
in this relationship.

15:58.958 --> 16:00.437
Ha!
Hate to break it to you,

16:00.437 --> 16:02.613
but you're the third wheel,
<i>babe!</i>

16:02.613 --> 16:05.616
Oh, so I guess
we <i>are</i> a "babe" couple.

16:05.616 --> 16:07.270
We are not a couple, Neil!

16:07.270 --> 16:11.535
For the love of God,
don't stand right there!

16:11.535 --> 16:12.797
We are through.

16:12.797 --> 16:14.147
I am done being fenced in

16:14.147 --> 16:15.800
like your-- your love veal.

16:15.800 --> 16:17.759
I am free-range, buster!

16:17.759 --> 16:20.849
Why is my iced coffee so hot?

16:20.849 --> 16:23.895
Wait!

16:23.895 --> 16:26.159
- What was that about?
- I don't know.

16:26.159 --> 16:27.464
But we have to keep them calm.

16:27.464 --> 16:29.901
They're Hulks now.

16:29.901 --> 16:31.642
Wait. Whoa, no.
Wait, where are you going?

16:31.642 --> 16:33.514
You can't go.
We need you as bait.

16:33.514 --> 16:35.211
No, bait--
Wrong word. Bad word.

16:35.211 --> 16:37.039
Not bait, but...

16:37.039 --> 16:39.041
No, bait's the right word.

16:39.041 --> 16:40.869
I wanted to kill Remecca
with kindness,

16:40.869 --> 16:43.524
not Cold War radiation.

16:43.524 --> 16:45.787
My Uncle Ray-Ray was killed
with kindness.

16:45.787 --> 16:47.745
It's a rough way to go.

16:49.443 --> 16:50.661
What...?

16:50.661 --> 16:52.141
Oh, don't mind me.

16:52.141 --> 16:54.578
Go back to your plan
to stifle free speech.

16:54.578 --> 16:56.319
A plan that would have
worked better...

16:56.319 --> 16:58.582
in a room with one door.

16:58.582 --> 17:00.715
Okay, Remecca,
I know this looks bad.

17:00.715 --> 17:04.458
Your podcast is about inspiring
people, and if you tear us down,

17:04.458 --> 17:06.155
I really think
you're gonna regret this.

17:06.155 --> 17:08.679
I regret nothing.

17:08.679 --> 17:11.073
- I'm sorry?
- They don't call it pod-friends.

17:11.073 --> 17:13.293
They call it pod-business.

17:13.293 --> 17:15.164
Do they call it either?

17:15.164 --> 17:18.254
Hey, Remecca...

17:18.254 --> 17:21.083
one very important thing
you're missing for this episode.

17:21.083 --> 17:23.825
A tell-all interview.

17:23.825 --> 17:27.742
I'll come clean about
everything, under one condition.

17:27.742 --> 17:30.049
You leave Abby out of it.

17:30.049 --> 17:32.529
<i>And</i> you get us all
giant mattresses

17:32.529 --> 17:35.228
that somehow come in tiny boxes.

17:38.013 --> 17:39.841
You have a deal.

17:39.841 --> 17:41.321
And so do you.

17:41.321 --> 17:43.410
But FYI, you can't put it
back in the box

17:43.410 --> 17:45.107
and watch it unfold again.

17:45.107 --> 17:48.893
You can try, but it will
only end in madness.

17:53.028 --> 17:55.509
Dan, I can't let you do that.

17:55.509 --> 17:56.858
You would lose your job.

17:56.858 --> 17:58.512
You know,
when I made that offer,

17:58.512 --> 18:01.167
I-I didn't see a bright side.

18:01.167 --> 18:03.256
Thank you for finding it.

18:08.826 --> 18:10.741
Hey, I've been texting you.

18:10.741 --> 18:12.221
Yeah, it's weird--
my phone isn't working.

18:12.221 --> 18:13.657
All my credit cards are erased,

18:13.657 --> 18:15.790
and when I pick up spoons,
they do this now.

18:18.749 --> 18:21.839
So, we don't really make
the best fake couple, huh?

18:21.839 --> 18:23.624
Scary thing is,
this was actually one of

18:23.624 --> 18:26.017
my healthier relationships.

18:26.017 --> 18:28.585
I might have some
real commitment issues.

18:28.585 --> 18:31.197
You know, I have been watching
the two of you,

18:31.197 --> 18:34.330
and you're
an absolute trainwreck.

18:34.330 --> 18:37.681
You would be perfect
for my new dating podcast,

18:37.681 --> 18:39.205
"Absolute Trainwreck."

18:39.205 --> 18:40.902
Actually, we're not--

18:40.902 --> 18:44.775
Gonna pass up on an opportunity
like this, right, babe?

18:44.775 --> 18:46.995
But there's one condition.

18:46.995 --> 18:48.649
You can't run that story on Dan.

18:48.649 --> 18:49.954
No.

18:49.954 --> 18:51.391
Eh, guess we're not all
gonna be heroes.

18:54.829 --> 18:59.138
Well, I guess that episode
of the podcast will be on soon.

18:59.138 --> 19:02.663
The end of the illustrious
career of Dan Fielding.

19:02.663 --> 19:04.317
We still have time
to fix this.

19:04.317 --> 19:08.059
We just have to break
the Internet, in one minute.

19:08.059 --> 19:10.366
Does this muffin
look anything like Jesus?

19:11.933 --> 19:13.195
Remecca was canceled!

19:13.195 --> 19:14.631
She lost all her sponsors,

19:14.631 --> 19:16.329
and her platforms
dropped the podcast.

19:16.329 --> 19:18.940
- What? What happened?
- Someone excavated <i>her</i>

19:18.940 --> 19:22.030
and found out she used to be
a crazy sketchy shock jock

19:22.030 --> 19:25.207
on a radio station upstate.

19:25.207 --> 19:27.949
<i>This is Becky Molson

19:27.949 --> 19:30.908
<i>and I regret nothing.</i>

19:30.908 --> 19:32.867
<i>It's Whirl 'Em Out
Wednesday, boys,</i>

19:32.867 --> 19:36.871
<i>so unwrap your package
and whirl those balls!</i>

19:38.568 --> 19:40.135
Ooh!

19:40.135 --> 19:42.442
<i>That's one for the Stank Bank.</i>

19:45.445 --> 19:48.361
You forget how much culture
there is outside of the cities.

19:50.363 --> 19:53.061
- I guess it got out.
- You knew?

19:53.061 --> 19:55.977
When Remecca said,
"I regret nothing,"

19:55.977 --> 19:58.327
I thought it sounded familiar,
so I did some digging,

19:58.327 --> 20:01.678
and turns out, she also has
a past that she's not proud of.

20:01.678 --> 20:04.551
I thought I could use it to
convince her to go easy on Dan,

20:04.551 --> 20:06.640
but she laughed me
out of the room.

20:06.640 --> 20:10.121
Well, someone
must have leaked it.

20:10.121 --> 20:12.646
I did.

20:12.646 --> 20:15.170
Who are you?

20:15.170 --> 20:18.129
Recognize me... now?

20:19.566 --> 20:21.002
The microphone guy.

20:21.002 --> 20:22.743
So, you took Remecca down?

20:22.743 --> 20:25.615
Well, I was tired
of living in her shadow.

20:25.615 --> 20:28.531
Sitting at home,
night after night,

20:28.531 --> 20:31.708
removing her weird mouth sounds.

20:31.708 --> 20:36.060
But you, Judge Stone,
you made me feel...

20:36.060 --> 20:37.801
heard.

20:41.892 --> 20:43.851
- What did you do?
- I don't know.

20:43.851 --> 20:47.507
I-I asked him if he wanted
to sit down once.

20:47.507 --> 20:49.204
The nerve of that guy.

20:49.204 --> 20:51.162
You know, I-I took a bullet
for you.

20:51.162 --> 20:53.034
The only reason to help
your fellow man

20:53.034 --> 20:54.470
is to have them in your debt.

20:54.470 --> 20:58.126
That is a currency
that never tanks.

20:58.126 --> 20:59.562
Well, too bad.

20:59.562 --> 21:02.652
You're not getting out of here
that easy.

21:02.652 --> 21:07.222
One of these days, I'm gonna
work up the courage to hug you.

21:07.222 --> 21:09.572
<i>Folks, I just got back
from France,</i>

21:09.572 --> 21:12.967
<i>where I had "fart blanche."</i>

21:15.839 --> 21:17.711
You know, I'll be the first
to say it...

21:17.711 --> 21:20.583
She pretty good.
