01:18.663 --> 01:21.643
- I'm gonna win!
- No...

02:26.540 --> 02:28.550
This one's on me, well...

02:34.706 --> 02:36.398
Look at the dolphins.

03:19.434 --> 03:21.591
Theo Weston lived a life...

03:21.711 --> 03:25.066
Was of great benefit to his community
and to his family.

03:25.186 --> 03:28.892
And our hearts go out to Lil and Ian
at this time.

03:55.415 --> 03:56.960
It turn out?

03:57.813 --> 03:59.385
Yeah, well you know...

03:59.505 --> 04:01.464
You give the people what they want...

04:02.909 --> 04:06.184
I'm sorry but you know what?
I just never really got the point of Theo.

04:06.304 --> 04:09.016
Well, I can't said that it was
a huge surprise...

04:09.051 --> 04:11.998
Or I wouldn't take a drive with him
anywhere if I could avoid it.

04:12.028 --> 04:14.491
He thought speed limits are for pufftas.

04:27.626 --> 04:29.451
The boy's taking it very hard.

04:47.617 --> 04:48.817
Are you okay?

04:49.001 --> 04:50.082
Yeah.

04:50.266 --> 04:51.723
Darling...

05:00.699 --> 05:02.399
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:02.818 --> 05:04.106
Where's mom?

05:04.238 --> 05:05.225
With Lil.

05:15.152 --> 05:18.328
I think you should take Ian down the beach.

05:22.161 --> 05:24.124
Come on Ian,
do you want to go down to the beach?

05:24.176 --> 05:25.243
Let's go.

05:26.446 --> 05:28.617
Let's get our stuff.

05:29.220 --> 05:30.990
Hey, you want to catch some blue crabs?

05:31.012 --> 05:32.542
Yeah, sure.

07:06.195 --> 07:08.042
God, Lil look at that...

07:10.408 --> 07:12.107
Did we do that?

07:13.351 --> 07:14.830
We must have been.

07:16.228 --> 07:17.944
We certainly did.

07:21.119 --> 07:23.002
They're beautiful.

07:24.268 --> 07:25.909
They're like young gods.

07:31.888 --> 07:33.161
Amazing.

07:34.142 --> 07:35.356
Yeah.

07:35.967 --> 07:37.475
We did all right.

07:58.335 --> 07:59.791
You had a good day?

08:00.050 --> 08:00.919
Great

08:01.632 --> 08:02.809
Are you hungry?

08:02.929 --> 08:04.016
Starving.

08:04.134 --> 08:05.187
Ravenous.

08:06.041 --> 08:07.682
Won't be a tick.

08:28.158 --> 08:30.146
What is that?

08:30.182 --> 08:31.889
I look like an angry boy.

08:32.265 --> 08:33.861
With that chin.

08:34.974 --> 08:36.931
That's horrible.

08:37.511 --> 08:39.206
Oh yeah that one, yeah...

08:40.023 --> 08:41.501
I'm pretty happy with that.

08:41.621 --> 08:44.155
Yeah, it's nice but not in
the same league.

08:44.207 --> 08:46.408
- Really? As those two?
- Yeah.

08:46.459 --> 08:47.896
- No way.
- Right?

08:47.940 --> 08:49.367
There's something about them.

08:49.411 --> 08:51.967
- I don't know.
- It's like sort of an unearthly aura.

08:55.462 --> 08:56.647
What's that?

08:57.795 --> 09:00.220
They're looking at pictures of themselves
as nimfits...

09:00.257 --> 09:02.183
They're admiring their own beauty.

09:03.743 --> 09:04.949
Let's have a look.

09:04.994 --> 09:07.414
- Hey!
- Give it back!

09:07.473 --> 09:09.791
Hold on.

09:10.475 --> 09:13.533
Come one, give us a break.
It was a long time ago.

09:14.936 --> 09:18.008
Time flies, doesn't it?
I'll tell you though...

09:18.091 --> 09:19.612
We may have been prettier then, but...

09:19.642 --> 09:21.987
- I think we have much more character now.
- You know what?

09:22.012 --> 09:22.523
Yeah.

09:22.524 --> 09:24.125
- She might be right.
- Yeah, that's...

09:24.521 --> 09:26.096
That's true.

09:28.075 --> 09:29.149
Well...

09:29.269 --> 09:30.790
Here's to our mothers.

09:31.930 --> 09:33.320
Thank you, my darling.

09:40.269 --> 09:42.469
- Come on, Tom. Give me a hand.
- Okay.

09:50.046 --> 09:51.297
Are you alright?

09:51.355 --> 09:53.198
Yeah, I'm fine mom.

09:57.076 --> 09:58.224
Dinner's ready.

10:00.937 --> 10:05.340
Remember that time when you had boobs
and I didn't? And I was...

10:05.460 --> 10:08.007
Well, you soon made up for it.

10:08.298 --> 10:10.599
It never stopped the boys from
buzzing around you, did it?

10:10.646 --> 10:13.718
Yeah, but the boring jocks you never had
anything to say.

10:13.755 --> 10:16.343
You had the interesting guys,
with long hair...

10:16.392 --> 10:20.881
They wrote poetry and smoked the old...

10:21.085 --> 10:24.260
Mine were just dull.

10:25.044 --> 10:26.892
They still are, aren't they?

10:27.012 --> 10:28.504
The good Saul.

10:28.559 --> 10:31.259
Come on, he's not so much dull as...

10:31.280 --> 10:33.260
He's just... Persistent.

10:33.335 --> 10:36.827
I want to know more about your boobs.

10:36.847 --> 10:39.604
Well, it was quite serious and...

10:39.625 --> 10:42.628
But Roz, she was very very comforting.
She used to say...

10:42.669 --> 10:45.405
Don't worry, pop this in your bra
and they'll be coming along soon.

10:45.432 --> 10:46.469
And so they were.

10:46.517 --> 10:49.046
Right Tom,
I think that's enough on this topic.

10:49.060 --> 10:51.246
I don't think it's entirely exhausted.

10:54.472 --> 10:55.572
One queen.

10:55.627 --> 10:57.032
And the king.

10:57.768 --> 10:59.016
- Ace.
- Cheat.

11:01.039 --> 11:03.501
It's your face.
It's always your face.

11:03.508 --> 11:06.902
I don't want to play anymore,
I don't like it now.

11:07.022 --> 11:08.504
- Hey.
- Hi.

11:08.559 --> 11:10.972
- You're very late.
- It was a big day.

11:11.020 --> 11:13.249
- In what way?
- I'll explain later.

11:13.679 --> 11:15.400
If you're hungry, we ate all of yours.

11:15.441 --> 11:17.805
- Nah, there's plenty more in the kitchen.
- No rush

11:17.862 --> 11:19.239
My turn to shuffle.

11:19.751 --> 11:21.490
I'm done.
Taking off.

11:22.069 --> 11:23.079
Mom.

11:23.513 --> 11:25.164
Early start.
Are you coming?

11:25.273 --> 11:26.875
Well...

11:27.196 --> 11:28.831
We're gonna watch a movie.

11:28.899 --> 11:30.699
Alright.
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

11:30.740 --> 11:31.661
Alright.

11:31.900 --> 11:33.372
Good night.

11:35.493 --> 11:38.180
Thanks boys for cleaning up.
Very nice...

11:38.227 --> 11:40.268
- No worries.
- No worries.

11:56.743 --> 11:58.175
Well?

12:03.519 --> 12:04.960
I've been offered a job.

12:04.988 --> 12:06.413
What?

12:06.467 --> 12:11.093
Senior lecturer in drama
at Sidney University.

12:11.332 --> 12:12.844
Sidney?

12:13.049 --> 12:15.722
It's a great department.

12:15.842 --> 12:18.182
It's quite a salary hike.

12:19.335 --> 12:21.251
Right?

12:22.913 --> 12:24.556
Sounds like you want to take it.

12:24.590 --> 12:26.684
Yeah, well...

12:26.922 --> 12:28.782
Yes, I do.
Of course I do.

12:28.851 --> 12:29.989
Yes.

12:30.917 --> 12:32.212
And...

12:32.594 --> 12:33.962
How would that work?

12:34.030 --> 12:35.912
Would you fly back on the weekends?

12:35.946 --> 12:39.329
No, I thought you and Tom
would come with me...

12:40.358 --> 12:41.777
You mean move?

12:41.838 --> 12:43.079
Move from here?

12:43.127 --> 12:45.638
Yeah, I know it's not gonna be easy.

12:47.152 --> 12:48.482
No.

12:49.764 --> 12:53.378
Darling, opportunities like these certainly
don't come along very often.

13:00.850 --> 13:03.768
You must have applied for this job, Harold.

13:05.275 --> 13:06.434
Yeah.

13:14.318 --> 13:16.254
You never discussed it with me.

13:18.417 --> 13:22.163
I didn't think I was gonna get it.
Not in a million years.

14:27.999 --> 14:29.349
Roz?

14:29.469 --> 14:30.556
Yeah?

14:32.349 --> 14:33.651
Are you okay?

14:41.377 --> 14:42.911
Should I close the door?

14:43.477 --> 14:44.657
No.

14:59.250 --> 15:00.423
Lil!

15:00.921 --> 15:02.550
Hi, Saul.

15:04.630 --> 15:06.103
- Oh Roz hi.
- Hi Saul.

15:06.158 --> 15:07.405
Didn't see you there.

15:07.862 --> 15:09.772
How are you?
What can I do for you?

15:09.984 --> 15:13.789
Well, I took the liberty of organizing
a little surprise.

15:13.932 --> 15:16.800
A celebration dinner tonight
at The Japanese.

15:17.925 --> 15:19.337
Celebrating what?

15:21.117 --> 15:22.420
My birthday.

15:22.720 --> 15:24.902
Happy birthday, Saul.

15:24.970 --> 15:27.002
Yeah, happy birthday.

15:27.122 --> 15:30.507
But I can't tonight, cause...

15:30.627 --> 15:32.598
We've got the book club.

15:32.714 --> 15:34.057
Really?

15:34.644 --> 15:36.553
You couldn't skip it just once?

15:37.345 --> 15:39.254
I wish I could.

15:39.309 --> 15:41.211
I'm doing the food.

15:42.650 --> 15:44.157
Oh, I see.

15:46.073 --> 15:47.389
Maybe another night.

15:47.430 --> 15:49.360
Yeah, another night.

15:49.688 --> 15:51.658
- I'll give you a bell.
- Great.

15:52.402 --> 15:53.554
Bye.

15:55.239 --> 15:56.602
Book club?

15:58.667 --> 16:01.435
You are really good liar.

16:01.906 --> 16:03.276
Really good.

16:05.550 --> 16:09.461
Okay, let's deal with it one at a time.

16:09.857 --> 16:13.164
You could get someone
to manage the gallery...

16:13.191 --> 16:16.152
Or you could open a similar place
down in Sidney.

16:17.829 --> 16:19.772
It's not as simple as that, Harold.

16:19.786 --> 16:23.366
Yeah, agreed but for Tom?

16:23.857 --> 16:27.370
And what he wants to do...
This isn't the place.

16:31.352 --> 16:34.911
He's bound to take some
time to organized, you know?

16:35.031 --> 16:36.091
Yeah.

16:36.211 --> 16:37.364
But...

16:38.837 --> 16:42.502
The point is that I need a wife...

16:42.622 --> 16:44.261
Permanent wife.

16:44.773 --> 16:46.836
You've got one, Harold.

16:47.047 --> 16:49.325
I'm up for 20 years now, you know.

16:49.445 --> 16:50.941
I do.

16:53.682 --> 16:56.621
It's just I don't get to
see you much lately.

16:57.207 --> 17:00.784
And when I do, it's like you're on loan.

17:01.221 --> 17:02.441
What?

17:02.990 --> 17:05.472
I think it's Lil you don't want to leave.

17:08.599 --> 17:11.116
Are you saying we're lesbians?

17:11.236 --> 17:13.660
No, not that it'd make any difference.

17:13.998 --> 17:15.832
You're just mad.

17:17.013 --> 17:19.269
Of course I'm gonna come with you,
what do you think...

17:19.310 --> 17:22.035
I just need time to get used to the idea,
that's all.

17:25.316 --> 17:27.627
I don't know what he's talking about.

17:28.018 --> 17:30.923
He says my real relationship
is isn't with him.

17:30.950 --> 17:32.171
It's with you.

17:32.260 --> 17:34.043
How can he think that?

17:34.111 --> 17:35.537
I know...

17:35.748 --> 17:37.251
We make him feel excluded.

17:37.285 --> 17:39.828
Oh my god, that's how I always felt.

17:39.856 --> 17:41.841
Even when Theo was alive, with his...

17:41.929 --> 17:46.260
Business trips and his girlfriends
ringing the house and his moods...

17:46.380 --> 17:49.359
You don't know how much
I used to envy you guys.

17:50.130 --> 17:52.222
He always seems so content.

17:52.263 --> 17:54.111
Well, we were.

17:56.709 --> 17:59.459
He's not saying we're lezzos.

18:00.939 --> 18:02.453
Not exactly.

18:07.655 --> 18:09.135
My hat!

18:10.769 --> 18:12.440
Go on!

18:13.326 --> 18:15.863
We're not lezzos!

18:19.230 --> 18:20.511
Are we?

18:22.903 --> 18:24.887
I don't think so.

18:25.249 --> 18:27.531
Not as far as I remember.

18:28.520 --> 18:30.532
We're just best friends.

18:31.336 --> 18:32.530
That's right.

18:32.681 --> 18:33.710
Right.

18:37.068 --> 18:39.700
I do remember that...

18:39.755 --> 18:42.107
Time that you...

18:43.077 --> 18:44.713
Well, it was...

18:45.313 --> 18:46.943
Remember?
That kiss?

18:46.970 --> 18:49.703
Oh my God...

18:51.932 --> 18:54.806
- But we had to practice on someone.
- Right.

18:56.648 --> 18:58.168
Does it make us...

18:58.355 --> 18:59.494
No...

19:00.687 --> 19:04.159
- Bloody men!
- Bloody men.

19:11.880 --> 19:15.688
You'll see, it's a much better
director's program down there.

19:15.743 --> 19:19.859
I mean not to mention the standard
of teaching, once you get going.

19:20.179 --> 19:22.177
That goes without saying.

19:25.034 --> 19:26.391
- Alright.
- Alright.

19:26.412 --> 19:28.212
- Look after her.
- Will do.

19:28.819 --> 19:32.549
Don't try and be macho and drive
too many hours of that, rest okay?

19:33.054 --> 19:34.451
I'm gonna miss you.

19:34.873 --> 19:36.701
It's only a couple of weeks.

20:25.112 --> 20:27.048
I didn't know you were out here.

20:27.625 --> 20:28.968
Hey.

20:29.575 --> 20:31.253
Mind if I join you?

20:31.826 --> 20:33.162
Of course not.

20:39.570 --> 20:41.111
Give us a drag.

20:42.605 --> 20:45.321
You can have a whole one
if you promised to behave yourself.

20:45.634 --> 20:47.694
A drag will do.

20:50.763 --> 20:52.475
I didn't know you smoke.

20:53.811 --> 20:55.966
I don't, I gave up years ago.

21:04.858 --> 21:06.997
Now I feel really sinful.

21:08.654 --> 21:10.392
Nothing wrong with that.

21:21.990 --> 21:23.545
How are you?

21:23.899 --> 21:25.297
Fine.

22:00.273 --> 22:01.848
You know, you're right.

22:01.875 --> 22:04.789
You might have to said yes,
he's a well set out bloke...

22:04.823 --> 22:07.165
No, it doesn't mean I
have to go out with him.

22:07.220 --> 22:09.150
Can't he take a hint?

22:09.225 --> 22:10.725
Evidently not.

22:11.229 --> 22:12.522
I got a suggestion.

22:12.577 --> 22:13.729
What?

22:13.927 --> 22:15.789
Tell him to go fuck himself.

22:17.446 --> 22:20.018
Supposed he doesn't know how.

22:24.493 --> 22:26.334
Love this song.

22:38.204 --> 22:40.024
Yeah.

22:48.892 --> 22:52.254
That's the worst dancing I've ever seen.

23:18.278 --> 23:20.249
Can you dance?

23:52.234 --> 23:54.037
I'm gonna slip away.

23:54.610 --> 23:57.078
I think Tom's had a little bit
too much to drink.

23:57.124 --> 23:58.331
Really?

23:58.972 --> 24:01.059
Is he misbehaving?

24:01.536 --> 24:02.865
No, he's fine.

24:02.879 --> 24:05.770
But Ian's gonna stay over and
make sure he's alright.

24:05.832 --> 24:07.223
Okay.

24:15.470 --> 24:17.038
See you tomorrow.

24:32.400 --> 24:34.077
Where's Tom?

24:34.316 --> 24:36.220
Throwing up, I reckon.

24:39.561 --> 24:41.133
Are you alright, mate?

24:41.726 --> 24:44.529
Yeah, I'm fine.

24:44.570 --> 24:46.332
- Need a hand?
- No, I'm alright.

24:46.452 --> 24:47.450
Come on.

24:47.648 --> 24:49.585
I said I'm alright.
That's fine.

24:49.626 --> 24:50.836
Alright.

24:51.463 --> 24:53.816
- I'll tuck you in.
- No fucking way.

24:54.007 --> 24:56.111
Careful, careful.
Slow down.

24:56.158 --> 24:57.263
- You're alright?
- Yeah.

24:57.324 --> 24:58.518
Yeah?

24:59.282 --> 25:01.732
It's alright, we're good.

25:33.272 --> 25:35.018
You have everything you need?

25:38.445 --> 25:39.604
No.

29:05.196 --> 29:06.321
Hi.

29:07.173 --> 29:08.414
Hi.

29:09.158 --> 29:10.118
I don't think he's here.

29:10.139 --> 29:12.015
I didn't come to see Ian.

29:14.093 --> 29:15.587
You better come in.

29:16.787 --> 29:19.269
I don't really wanna go to Sidney.

29:19.628 --> 29:21.954
But Dad seems to have it all worked out.

29:22.172 --> 29:24.047
I just don't...

29:24.088 --> 29:26.308
Really see how I can get out of it.

29:28.183 --> 29:30.422
Do you want to get out of it?

29:33.297 --> 29:35.357
I don't really want to live here.

29:38.307 --> 29:39.875
- No.
- No.

29:40.817 --> 29:42.146
God no...

29:49.296 --> 29:50.868
We'd really miss you.

29:51.857 --> 29:53.248
And I'd miss you.

29:54.482 --> 29:56.028
Tom!
Christ!

29:56.062 --> 29:57.563
I'm sorry.

29:59.690 --> 30:01.383
You really shouldn't have done that.

30:01.615 --> 30:02.842
I know.

30:04.737 --> 30:07.793
I mean, supposed Ian had walked in or...

30:07.835 --> 30:09.915
Is that all you're worried about?

30:11.032 --> 30:13.195
No, I... I just...

30:16.311 --> 30:18.124
Ian's other ways engaged...

30:22.706 --> 30:24.256
What does that mean?

30:24.376 --> 30:27.543
Means last night I went out to
the kitchen for a drink and...

30:27.611 --> 30:30.228
Caught my mother coming out
of his bedroom.

30:31.237 --> 30:33.358
- What?
- With her jeans in her hand.

30:35.719 --> 30:37.472
It's not funny, Tom.

30:46.888 --> 30:48.259
It's impossible.

31:15.196 --> 31:17.545
She's known him since he was a baby.

31:18.881 --> 31:22.516
They're probably been thinking about it
for quite a while.

31:23.718 --> 31:25.414
Wouldn't you say?

31:47.566 --> 31:49.885
- Are you coming?
- Not today.

31:51.068 --> 31:53.515
- Are you alright?
- Fine.

33:18.136 --> 33:19.552
You again.

33:19.739 --> 33:21.111
Afraid so.

33:32.865 --> 33:35.507
I don't really want to
go back there tonight.

33:36.991 --> 33:38.832
Can I please stay here?

33:41.647 --> 33:42.781
Yeah.

33:44.724 --> 33:45.986
Yes, of course.

37:05.021 --> 37:08.115
Hi.
Where have you been?

37:10.089 --> 37:11.820
At Lil's.

37:12.425 --> 37:15.161
Doing to her what Ian's been doing to you.

38:04.894 --> 38:07.212
We'll finished this later, okay?

38:17.220 --> 38:20.187
I don't know, Lil what have we done?

38:20.775 --> 38:22.428
Crossed the line.

38:24.214 --> 38:26.285
It can't happen again.

38:28.543 --> 38:30.642
No, no I supposed it can't.

38:30.671 --> 38:32.492
No, of course it can't.

38:39.586 --> 38:42.033
It's Roz who wants to stop.

38:42.800 --> 38:44.373
She came to see me.

38:45.001 --> 38:46.395
What did she say?

38:48.245 --> 38:50.770
It doesn't matter, does it darling?

38:51.406 --> 38:53.620
It's just obvious.

38:53.837 --> 38:56.890
The whole thing is unacceptable.

38:58.190 --> 38:59.677
I love her.

40:46.167 --> 40:47.911
It's over, Ian.

40:48.432 --> 40:49.778
No.

40:53.360 --> 40:54.778
Please, don't.

41:37.121 --> 41:39.009
You have to leave.

41:48.500 --> 41:50.266
You have to leave.

44:04.691 --> 44:06.570
How are you feeling?

44:11.779 --> 44:12.989
Good.

44:14.388 --> 44:15.736
Yeah...

44:17.081 --> 44:18.539
Me too.

44:19.202 --> 44:20.449
Yeah.

44:25.466 --> 44:26.836
In fact, I...

44:30.080 --> 44:32.398
I can't remember being this happy.

44:35.756 --> 44:37.206
I know.

44:40.566 --> 44:42.039
It's scary.

44:43.008 --> 44:44.515
Very.

44:47.394 --> 44:49.003
I don't want to stop.

44:53.951 --> 44:56.416
I don't see why we have to.

44:58.712 --> 45:01.312
I'm sure they'll get bored
of us soon enough.

45:03.885 --> 45:05.515
Bound to.

45:11.628 --> 45:12.736
Hey!

45:12.947 --> 45:14.099
You're alright?

45:14.558 --> 45:16.920
It's a long drive, but...

45:17.518 --> 45:19.530
I got you an interview...

45:19.603 --> 45:21.423
You'll be going down next week.

45:22.079 --> 45:23.377
Great.

45:26.742 --> 45:28.389
You've changed.

45:28.673 --> 45:29.737
What?

45:30.379 --> 45:32.423
What is it?
You got a girlfriend or something?

45:32.656 --> 45:34.303
Something like that.

45:36.256 --> 45:37.774
So, how're things in Sidney?

45:37.825 --> 45:39.487
Yeah, it was alright.

45:39.523 --> 45:41.433
And the Uni?
You like it?

45:41.440 --> 45:43.375
Yeah, nice people.

45:46.764 --> 45:49.247
I'm gonna miss that view...

45:49.611 --> 45:51.849
The place is big...

45:51.969 --> 45:54.533
It's very central, lots of space.

45:54.853 --> 45:55.816
You have a photograph?

45:55.837 --> 45:57.659
Sure, I got plenty of them in the laptop.

45:57.696 --> 46:00.159
Let's see them.

46:03.381 --> 46:05.535
I think this is what I'll miss the most.

46:05.549 --> 46:08.144
The sound of it.
Sound of the sea.

46:08.188 --> 46:09.923
Thanks a lot.

46:11.024 --> 46:15.051
I mean apart from the personal things,
obviously.

46:25.111 --> 46:26.641
What's the matter, darling?

46:30.069 --> 46:32.816
What's the matter?
Are you worried about the move?

46:33.472 --> 46:34.864
Well, yeah.

46:34.901 --> 46:37.534
Is it because Tom's new girlfriend?

46:40.704 --> 46:42.708
How do you know Tom has a new girlfriend?

46:42.788 --> 46:44.891
He just about admitted that much to me...

46:44.928 --> 46:48.470
But it's not really the place
to live by his education.

46:48.732 --> 46:53.386
He's got a place right in front of him, one
of the finest drama faculty in the country.

46:53.853 --> 46:55.294
Yeah, he knows that.

46:55.345 --> 46:57.750
What is it then?
I've got this fantastic new job...

46:57.772 --> 47:01.157
You don't side by me,
and I feel like an abandon ship.

47:01.277 --> 47:04.284
Harold, we don't feel that at all.

47:05.347 --> 47:07.322
You may not, but I do.

47:44.690 --> 47:48.285
The house you found is great, Harold.

47:48.817 --> 47:50.501
It's not that.

48:01.164 --> 48:04.333
I don't think we're gonna be able
to come and live in it.

48:04.639 --> 48:06.279
Why not?
What's the problem?

48:06.490 --> 48:09.508
Tom and I had a long
talk the other day and...

48:12.080 --> 48:13.902
Neither of us...

48:14.106 --> 48:16.836
Can bear to leave here, not for now.

48:17.594 --> 48:19.307
You made your mind up?

48:20.355 --> 48:21.521
Yeah.

48:26.366 --> 48:27.927
It's got something to do with Lil?

48:27.933 --> 48:30.255
No, it's not of the reasons
you think, Harold...

48:30.299 --> 48:32.952
I can't even explain it, it's just I...

48:33.728 --> 48:38.130
Boils down to one simple fact, is that
we can't imagine living anywhere else.

48:40.080 --> 48:41.735
I don't understand.

48:43.003 --> 48:44.854
No, I'm not sure I do.

48:49.651 --> 48:53.069
If this fucking house means more to you
than I do...

48:53.958 --> 48:55.448
Harold...

48:58.910 --> 49:00.429
I'm sorry.

49:00.677 --> 49:03.111
I really...
I really am.

49:16.339 --> 49:18.198
I gotta get rid of Saul.

49:18.263 --> 49:20.399
He keeps hanging around.

49:21.055 --> 49:23.874
I'm afraid he might catch us out or something.

49:26.760 --> 49:29.792
He just need to see us all together,
out and about.

49:30.485 --> 49:32.683
Ever so often, that's all it takes.

49:32.734 --> 49:34.156
Yeah.

49:36.918 --> 49:39.704
I wonder why his wife left him.

49:39.974 --> 49:41.949
It's never a good sign, is it?

49:48.948 --> 49:52.300
I'll fucking kill you!

49:55.554 --> 49:57.121
Oh my god.

49:58.119 --> 50:00.968
Roz! They're trying to kill each other!

50:08.732 --> 50:10.707
You fucking coward.

50:13.403 --> 50:14.500
You're nuts.

50:16.023 --> 50:18.224
You're out of fucking mind.

50:40.234 --> 50:41.546
Come on.

50:49.010 --> 50:50.453
Hi Saul.

50:50.919 --> 50:51.931
Are you alright?

50:51.967 --> 50:53.702
Just got caught on the rocks.

50:53.753 --> 50:55.822
It looks nasty,
you might want a tetanus shot.

50:55.837 --> 50:59.285
That's alright, we'll just put some
antiseptic on it. It'll be fine.

50:59.366 --> 51:00.845
We'll see you, Saul.

51:58.314 --> 51:59.837
Where are you going?

52:00.522 --> 52:02.186
To your room.

52:02.981 --> 52:04.730
Ian!

52:14.185 --> 52:15.942
See you at yours.

52:40.796 --> 52:41.903
Lil.

52:42.326 --> 52:43.026
Hi.

52:43.070 --> 52:45.013
- Hi, Saul.
- What are you doing?

52:45.625 --> 52:46.923
Roz.

52:47.455 --> 52:48.635
Harold's not with you?

52:48.694 --> 52:50.683
No, he's back in Sidney.

52:51.376 --> 52:52.571
Didn't stay long.

52:52.600 --> 52:54.227
Had to get back to work.

52:58.302 --> 53:01.543
This isn't exactly what I had in mind.

53:01.995 --> 53:04.364
I wasn't expecting to see you here, Roz.

53:07.671 --> 53:09.384
If you'd rather be alone that's fine.

53:09.413 --> 53:11.500
No... No...

53:11.620 --> 53:13.701
- Tea?
- No, I'm fine.

53:14.131 --> 53:17.037
Anyway, I can say what I want to say
in front of Roz.

53:26.117 --> 53:28.948
Lil, I think you know how I feel about you.

53:29.014 --> 53:30.552
I'm in love with you.

53:30.672 --> 53:32.852
I've been in love with you for a while.

53:33.267 --> 53:36.941
And I just thought this might be the moment
where we could discuss our relationship.

53:42.584 --> 53:46.622
I know this is the last thing in the world
you want to hear, so...

53:46.957 --> 53:49.351
But I don't think it's going to work...

53:49.424 --> 53:50.772
I'm asking Lil.

53:50.892 --> 53:52.944
But she's already told you.

53:53.927 --> 53:56.623
I think you're gonna have to take no
for an answer.

53:56.879 --> 53:59.356
Yeah Roz, but I want to hear it from Lil.

54:03.000 --> 54:05.515
Don't you think it'd be better
off with a bloke?

54:05.762 --> 54:07.133
I mean both of you.

54:08.189 --> 54:10.625
Two beautiful women like you.

54:19.723 --> 54:21.152
My god.

54:23.455 --> 54:25.532
You must think I'm a fucking idiot.

54:27.523 --> 54:29.257
So that's it.

54:32.073 --> 54:34.435
I don't know what you're talking about.

54:35.798 --> 54:38.320
I must have given you a really big laugh.

54:40.332 --> 54:41.739
I'm so sorry.

54:42.912 --> 54:44.967
Saul...

54:52.139 --> 54:54.004
Oh my god...

55:02.665 --> 55:04.675
Did you just figure it out?

55:14.092 --> 55:16.541
You might need to be quicker on the mark.

55:17.387 --> 55:20.657
- He's gonna tell everyone.
- It's okay, it's probably for the best.

56:08.415 --> 56:09.480
Bastard...

56:09.531 --> 56:11.881
You're going in!

57:01.344 --> 57:05.673
I know that, I don't care if having them
made in China is gonna save us 60%.

57:07.350 --> 57:08.778
Alright.

57:09.412 --> 57:10.556
Alright.

57:10.676 --> 57:13.167
We're gonna have to decide
in the next week or two.

57:14.589 --> 57:16.360
Okay, I'll think about it.

57:16.885 --> 57:18.860
I'll talk to you again on Monday.

57:21.185 --> 57:24.046
You're alright if I take off now?
I promised to pick up Tom.

57:24.155 --> 57:25.205
Fine.

57:36.974 --> 57:39.349
- See you in the morning, Mr Weston.
- Bye.

57:57.046 --> 57:59.556
Mother, did you not say
to me a little while ago...

57:59.585 --> 58:02.879
That there was nothing in the world that
you would not do for me, if I asked you.

58:02.938 --> 58:04.900
Indeed I did so.

58:04.943 --> 58:06.459
And you'll stick to it, mother?

58:06.481 --> 58:10.552
You may rely on it, my dear and only boy.

58:10.672 --> 58:14.507
I have nothing in the world,
but only you to live along...

58:14.522 --> 58:16.839
Very well.
And I shall hear...

58:17.867 --> 58:20.811
Mother you have a strong and sted-fast mind,
in know.

58:20.847 --> 58:21.678
But now...

58:21.715 --> 58:24.397
Did I say you could invite your mate
to wander in the rehearsal?

58:26.263 --> 58:28.158
Sorry, I just...

58:28.639 --> 58:30.993
This is a private work space.

58:31.343 --> 58:33.493
Not fucking movies on a Saturday morning.

58:33.784 --> 58:36.494
I wouldn't have a problem with the guy,
if he was a good director...

58:36.530 --> 58:39.633
But he's just such a
fucking wanker, you know?

58:39.669 --> 58:42.715
If he was a good director,
he wouldn't need to throw his weight around.

58:42.810 --> 58:44.071
Yeah.

58:44.959 --> 58:47.228
Hey, dad's offering me
a production down in Sidney.

58:47.253 --> 58:48.371
Oh yeah?

58:48.472 --> 58:51.929
Yeah, the George Gershman story
with second years.

58:52.213 --> 58:53.758
You should take it.

58:53.809 --> 58:56.023
I have to be away for at least a month.

58:56.066 --> 58:58.080
- So?
- What about Lil?

58:58.116 --> 59:01.165
She'll be fine. She wouldn't want you
to miss an opportunity because of her.

59:01.201 --> 59:02.601
You think?

59:02.721 --> 59:03.956
Absolutely.

01:01:13.801 --> 01:01:14.779
Thank you.

01:01:15.014 --> 01:01:16.469
Can I do that again?

01:01:16.589 --> 01:01:18.286
Why?
It was very good.

01:01:18.685 --> 01:01:20.253
I can do it better.

01:01:32.051 --> 01:01:33.391
Hello?

01:01:33.882 --> 01:01:35.580
Hi, darling.

01:01:35.609 --> 01:01:39.173
No, it's fine. We were just about to eat,
but Roz can dish up.

01:01:39.429 --> 01:01:41.199
So, how's it all going?

01:01:41.378 --> 01:01:42.632
Yeah?

01:01:43.951 --> 01:01:45.583
Rehearsals are going well?

01:01:46.039 --> 01:01:47.148
Yeah.

01:01:47.469 --> 01:01:49.401
The girl playing Roxie is very very good.

01:01:49.422 --> 01:01:51.512
She's a really strong performer and...

01:01:51.562 --> 01:01:54.249
Seems like she's got quite a lot of potential.

01:01:58.479 --> 01:01:59.798
And you're happy?

01:01:59.862 --> 01:02:02.051
Yeah, I'm very comfortable.

01:02:02.428 --> 01:02:05.308
It's been great to get to know
dad's new family and...

01:02:05.365 --> 01:02:07.489
He seems very settled.

01:02:07.531 --> 01:02:09.156
That's great.

01:02:09.570 --> 01:02:12.660
Hey look um if you guys are about to eat dinner...

01:02:12.681 --> 01:02:14.563
Maybe I should call you back

01:02:14.577 --> 01:02:16.930
in an hour or two?

01:02:19.196 --> 01:02:20.230
Okay.

01:02:20.273 --> 01:02:22.417
Give my love to the others.

01:02:23.621 --> 01:02:25.260
And to you.

01:02:27.242 --> 01:02:28.447
Love you.

01:02:30.072 --> 01:02:33.589
He seems very taken with
the girl playing Roxie.

01:02:34.124 --> 01:02:36.148
Lil, come on.

01:02:36.268 --> 01:02:38.655
I'm sure she's very taken with him too.

01:02:38.676 --> 01:02:42.482
If he was taken with her,
I don't think he would've mentioned her.

01:02:42.602 --> 01:02:44.527
- Right?
- Exactly.

01:02:45.454 --> 01:02:46.502
No.

01:02:46.666 --> 01:02:49.280
He thinks she's going to be a big star.

01:02:51.454 --> 01:02:55.290
There's no where near because...

01:02:55.326 --> 01:02:59.643
This big bat...
Was into a...

01:03:02.567 --> 01:03:04.827
- You want a drink?
- Love one.

01:03:15.573 --> 01:03:16.763
Here.

01:03:17.504 --> 01:03:18.843
Thanks.

01:03:29.708 --> 01:03:31.987
Can I ask you a personal question?

01:03:32.243 --> 01:03:33.610
Yeah, what?

01:03:35.047 --> 01:03:36.527
Are you gay?

01:03:42.384 --> 01:03:43.864
I'm afraid not.

01:03:50.251 --> 01:03:54.316
Hey I hear really good reports coming out
of the rehearsal room.

01:03:54.436 --> 01:03:56.137
Happy to hear it.

01:03:57.867 --> 01:03:59.832
Look at you, Dad.

01:04:04.216 --> 01:04:06.302
So everything worked out for the best.

01:04:07.103 --> 01:04:09.802
Everything just works
out the way it's gonna...

01:04:09.838 --> 01:04:13.817
We just plod along behind it and
try and keep up.

01:04:14.216 --> 01:04:17.543
You're not still angry with mom, are you?

01:04:20.697 --> 01:04:23.464
God no, no...

01:04:25.927 --> 01:04:27.226
You know?

01:04:31.611 --> 01:04:34.907
Soon enough I won't let
you see me like this.

01:04:35.939 --> 01:04:38.510
I don't you to even think about getting old.

01:04:39.642 --> 01:04:42.401
That'll happen whether
I think about it or not.

01:04:42.415 --> 01:04:43.640
No.

01:04:43.818 --> 01:04:45.291
I won't let it.

01:04:47.877 --> 01:04:50.909
You can't stop it, Ian.
It's going to happen.

01:04:51.315 --> 01:04:52.384
Please.

01:04:58.646 --> 01:05:01.280
Okay, I won't get old.
Will that do you?

01:05:01.743 --> 01:05:02.561
Yeah.

01:05:06.408 --> 01:05:09.083
You're crazy.
We're both crazy.

01:05:13.986 --> 01:05:15.915
Come on, it's not me.

01:05:15.980 --> 01:05:17.325
I'm not.

01:05:20.693 --> 01:05:22.018
Yeah...

01:05:22.352 --> 01:05:23.720
I really think we should go home.

01:05:23.734 --> 01:05:25.685
I think we should hit the road.

01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:29.037
No way, come one.
One more, one more for the road.

01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:30.653
Come on, please...

01:05:30.689 --> 01:05:31.814
Alright, I'll get them.

01:05:31.843 --> 01:05:34.086
No, I'll get them.
My shout, my idea.

01:05:34.107 --> 01:05:36.229
Get out of the way, I'm driving.

01:05:36.250 --> 01:05:39.485
- Guess what? I'm not. Tequila for you?
- No.

01:05:41.784 --> 01:05:43.110
I've never seen her like this.

01:05:43.153 --> 01:05:44.712
She's panicking.

01:05:44.734 --> 01:05:47.796
Hi, could I get a 2 gin and tonics
and a beer?

01:05:47.818 --> 01:05:49.449
And a tequila shot please?

01:05:49.492 --> 01:05:50.781
I'll pay for those, mate.

01:05:50.809 --> 01:05:52.112
What?

01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:55.028
What's your name?

01:05:55.063 --> 01:05:56.558
- I'm Lil.
- Hi Lil.

01:05:56.580 --> 01:05:58.231
- Thanks.
- I'm Richard.

01:05:58.438 --> 01:06:01.414
Hi... Nice to meet you.

01:06:01.464 --> 01:06:03.483
Well, what do you know?
Chivalry's not dead.

01:06:03.508 --> 01:06:04.708
I'm so proud of it.

01:06:06.641 --> 01:06:08.341
You need a hand?

01:06:08.398 --> 01:06:10.912
No, I'm okay.
This...

01:06:10.961 --> 01:06:14.277
Lovely gentleman seems to
want to buy us the drinks.

01:06:14.327 --> 01:06:16.107
- That's alright.
- Who are you?

01:06:16.150 --> 01:06:17.552
I'm her son.

01:06:17.927 --> 01:06:19.422
Thanks.

01:06:19.714 --> 01:06:21.487
Well, no harm done, sonny.

01:06:21.537 --> 01:06:23.331
You better run along now.

01:06:26.350 --> 01:06:28.059
That's what you called a buzz-kill.

01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:31.725
I assure you, I had him when I was 3.

01:06:34.854 --> 01:06:36.662
Hey, what's the matter?

01:06:36.705 --> 01:06:38.640
Nothing, I was having fun.

01:06:38.842 --> 01:06:41.883
I don't know why you had to go and
stick your beak in, he was a good bloke.

01:06:41.933 --> 01:06:43.058
Mom.

01:06:44.454 --> 01:06:46.256
- Bye.
- I'll see you.

01:06:46.740 --> 01:06:48.128
Bye.

01:06:51.186 --> 01:06:54.632
At some point, I gotta learn
to live my own life.

01:06:56.488 --> 01:06:58.203
Two days, mom.

01:06:58.323 --> 01:07:00.403
- He's back in two days.
- I know.

01:07:15.889 --> 01:07:17.639
Are you coming in?

01:07:18.137 --> 01:07:20.123
Just for a few minutes.

01:07:21.298 --> 01:07:23.067
Roz expecting you?

01:07:24.284 --> 01:07:25.644
I think so.

01:07:26.328 --> 01:07:27.375
Come on.

01:07:32.914 --> 01:07:35.378
Don't let me keep you, darling.

01:07:36.275 --> 01:07:38.568
I'll stay as long as you like.

01:07:40.931 --> 01:07:43.665
Everything's gonna be fine, I promise.

01:09:24.465 --> 01:09:25.975
Very nice.

01:09:41.046 --> 01:09:43.282
Are you hungry?
Ready for yum-yums?

01:09:45.625 --> 01:09:48.846
I don't see why you have to rush off
in such a hurry.

01:09:48.881 --> 01:09:52.430
Stick around for a few days and
luxuriate in your triumph.

01:09:52.479 --> 01:09:54.082
Stay for the weekend, at least.

01:09:54.109 --> 01:09:55.562
No, I've got to get back.

01:09:56.181 --> 01:09:58.059
You got a girl waiting, is that it?

01:09:58.108 --> 01:09:59.119
Not a girl.

01:10:00.234 --> 01:10:02.119
Just some stuff I gotta do.

01:10:03.957 --> 01:10:06.083
I'm coming up to you 21st.

01:10:06.145 --> 01:10:09.383
If I'm still welcome up there, that is.

01:10:10.278 --> 01:10:11.660
Don't be stupid.

01:10:12.569 --> 01:10:14.223
I won't miss that.

01:10:14.532 --> 01:10:17.030
Key to the door, all that stuff.

01:10:18.722 --> 01:10:20.884
What do you reckon, Dad?
Is the door worth opening?

01:10:20.904 --> 01:10:22.417
It's gonna open anyway,

01:10:22.797 --> 01:10:26.167
so you might as well walk through
there with a big smile on your face.

01:10:49.932 --> 01:10:52.182
God, you're beautiful.

01:11:23.933 --> 01:11:26.110
So do you want to do another musical?

01:11:28.036 --> 01:11:30.257
I rather do a play next.

01:11:30.305 --> 01:11:31.846
Something contemporary.

01:11:31.915 --> 01:11:33.800
Sounds like a good idea.

01:11:33.821 --> 01:11:36.578
But the fact of the matter is,
for the next few years...

01:11:36.620 --> 01:11:38.876
I just have to take whatever
I get offered.

01:11:39.090 --> 01:11:41.096
I don't really have a choice.

01:11:42.417 --> 01:11:43.738
I'll get it.

01:11:47.485 --> 01:11:48.827
Hello?

01:11:49.921 --> 01:11:50.795
Hi.

01:11:52.982 --> 01:11:55.776
Yeah, of course I was expecting you.

01:11:58.156 --> 01:11:59.532
Yeah, I'm good.

01:12:03.891 --> 01:12:05.109
Yeah.

01:12:06.588 --> 01:12:07.989
What happened?

01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:22.750
Hi Harold.

01:12:24.007 --> 01:12:25.569
How are you going?

01:12:25.617 --> 01:12:26.360
Roz.

01:12:26.380 --> 01:12:27.970
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:12:29.055 --> 01:12:30.561
This is Mary.

01:12:30.681 --> 01:12:31.848
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:12:31.869 --> 01:12:33.279
I'm Roz.

01:12:33.368 --> 01:12:34.809
- Welcome.
- Thanks.

01:12:34.836 --> 01:12:38.224
Baby was teething, grizzling along,
Molly thought she'd stay behind...

01:12:38.244 --> 01:12:41.726
and I thought I'd bring the
birthday boy a nice surprise.

01:12:41.753 --> 01:12:43.645
Nothing like a nice surprise.

01:12:43.900 --> 01:12:45.221
It's great.

01:13:51.644 --> 01:13:53.873
- Cheers.
- Cheers, darling.

01:14:10.051 --> 01:14:12.468
Mary.
This is Lil and Ian.

01:14:12.530 --> 01:14:14.532
Hi, I've heard so much about you.

01:14:14.573 --> 01:14:18.435
I wish I could say the same
but Tom's a bit of a secretive bugger.

01:14:23.471 --> 01:14:25.149
Would you like to dance?

01:14:25.170 --> 01:14:26.876
Sure, thanks.

01:14:27.474 --> 01:14:28.582
Happy birthday.

01:14:28.610 --> 01:14:30.034
Thanks, man.

01:14:33.125 --> 01:14:34.556
Come on, Harold.

01:14:34.900 --> 01:14:36.506
- Come, indulge me.
- No, Roz.

01:14:36.540 --> 01:14:39.072
- Come on.
- Please.

01:14:51.088 --> 01:14:53.393
She's staying in a hotel.

01:14:53.455 --> 01:14:55.808
I could drop her home and then come by.

01:14:55.835 --> 01:14:57.203
If you want.

01:14:59.322 --> 01:15:01.813
I don't think that's such a good idea.

01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:48.897
Coming in?

01:15:51.030 --> 01:15:52.241
I don't know.

01:15:54.284 --> 01:15:57.087
Don't you want your extra
special birthday present?

01:15:57.623 --> 01:15:59.137
Yeah, of course.

01:16:14.015 --> 01:16:16.506
I think this is what
we've been dreading, Lil.

01:16:19.791 --> 01:16:21.580
We have to bow out.

01:16:29.910 --> 01:16:31.059
Lil...

01:16:42.794 --> 01:16:45.231
I don't know if I could bear it.

01:16:45.293 --> 01:16:46.669
I know.

01:16:47.509 --> 01:16:48.823
We have to.

01:16:56.982 --> 01:16:59.906
I have to, you don't.

01:17:00.099 --> 01:17:01.793
Ian doesn't have a girlfriend.

01:17:01.814 --> 01:17:04.360
I know, but he should have.
Shouldn't he?

01:17:07.164 --> 01:17:08.568
Yeah.

01:17:09.724 --> 01:17:11.437
I supposed he should.

01:17:25.965 --> 01:17:27.947
We have to stand together.

01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:29.282
Okay?

01:17:33.732 --> 01:17:35.789
- Yeah.
- And put an end to it.

01:17:37.312 --> 01:17:38.647
Yeah.

01:17:41.626 --> 01:17:43.428
We just have to.

01:17:45.864 --> 01:17:47.494
I know we do.

01:17:58.078 --> 01:18:00.955
I don't see why what Tom gets up to
has anything to do with us.

01:18:00.990 --> 01:18:03.302
- I'm not getting married.
- Who says I'm getting married?

01:18:03.343 --> 01:18:05.269
Then, I'm not doing whatever
it is you're doing.

01:18:05.290 --> 01:18:08.405
Fucking someone else, I'm not doing that.
I have no intention of doing that.

01:18:08.680 --> 01:18:10.344
All right, Ian, that's enough.

01:18:10.365 --> 01:18:12.043
It doesn't matter.

01:18:13.241 --> 01:18:15.188
This has gone on long enough.

01:18:17.038 --> 01:18:19.254
Why can't you leave things as they are?

01:18:20.520 --> 01:18:22.491
It's all going to be fine.

01:18:23.489 --> 01:18:25.498
We're going to be respectable...

01:18:25.618 --> 01:18:28.185
Pillars of the community from here on end.

01:18:29.073 --> 01:18:31.653
And we'll be model mothers-in-laws...

01:18:32.060 --> 01:18:34.923
And before you know it,
we'll be the perfect grandmothers.

01:18:36.656 --> 01:18:38.847
I will never forgive you for this.

01:19:05.750 --> 01:19:07.367
I'm so sorry.

01:19:09.905 --> 01:19:11.377
No, darling.

01:19:14.239 --> 01:19:17.017
It was going to happen sooner or later.

01:19:29.804 --> 01:19:32.363
And responsibly and joyfully...

01:19:32.721 --> 01:19:36.436
In mutual respect
and the promise to be faithful...

01:19:37.138 --> 01:19:39.546
Come together in the presence of God...

01:19:39.766 --> 01:19:43.137
To witness the marriage of Tom and Mary.

01:19:43.257 --> 01:19:47.126
And to ask God's blessing on them
as we share their joy.

01:19:47.745 --> 01:19:51.039
Marriage is a gift of God, our creator.

01:19:51.128 --> 01:19:55.018
It is a symbol of God's
unending love for his people...

01:19:55.224 --> 01:19:58.765
and of the union between
Christ and His church.

01:19:59.508 --> 01:20:02.101
Christ loved his bride, the church.

01:20:02.122 --> 01:20:04.475
And gave Himself for her.

01:20:04.791 --> 01:20:07.680
As He has called Tom
and Mary to marriage...

01:20:07.749 --> 01:20:11.223
So He draws their different
gifts and hopes.

01:20:11.278 --> 01:20:14.484
Into the unity of love and service.

01:20:18.362 --> 01:20:20.797
Relax, it'll be your turn next.

01:20:20.845 --> 01:20:21.698
Yeah?

01:20:21.712 --> 01:20:24.585
Many good things about being married.

01:20:25.727 --> 01:20:27.956
You're the one to blame
for this, aren't you?

01:20:28.011 --> 01:20:31.006
I thought you were supposed to praise
the fairy godmother.

01:20:31.041 --> 01:20:32.451
Not blame them.

01:20:32.513 --> 01:20:35.456
Yeah, don't wave your
fucking wand over me.

01:20:42.598 --> 01:20:45.245
Hello.
Nice to see you again.

01:20:45.775 --> 01:20:47.591
You look lovely.

01:21:37.764 --> 01:21:40.344
Hi, can I get a champagne?
Thank you.

01:21:45.267 --> 01:21:47.636
Hey, hey...

01:21:49.893 --> 01:21:51.218
Are you alright?

01:21:51.562 --> 01:21:52.588
Fine, why?

01:21:52.629 --> 01:21:53.998
You're just...

01:21:54.025 --> 01:21:55.966
You seem a bit morose, that's all.

01:21:57.816 --> 01:22:01.366
No, just occasions like
these make you think...

01:22:01.612 --> 01:22:03.868
I hope they do better than us.

01:22:03.889 --> 01:22:05.169
Don't you?

01:22:06.698 --> 01:22:08.858
Yeah, of course.

01:22:12.278 --> 01:22:13.881
Just wondering.

01:22:44.275 --> 01:22:45.679
Where's mom?

01:22:46.202 --> 01:22:47.750
She went home.

01:22:48.115 --> 01:22:49.670
Retired hurt?

01:22:50.837 --> 01:22:51.973
If you like.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:53.638
I don't like.

01:23:06.911 --> 01:23:08.748
Why did you want to ruin everything?

01:23:08.817 --> 01:23:10.695
I didn't want to.

01:23:51.742 --> 01:23:52.981
Roz.

01:24:00.044 --> 01:24:01.826
Roz, are you there?

01:24:04.887 --> 01:24:06.480
Roz, let me in.

01:24:09.645 --> 01:24:10.801
Roz?

01:24:19.446 --> 01:24:20.877
Roz!

01:24:21.276 --> 01:24:22.878
Let me in!

01:25:22.388 --> 01:25:24.548
It's just up here on the right.

01:25:24.810 --> 01:25:26.963
I think he's still sleeping.

01:25:26.991 --> 01:25:29.316
Wait, you go in.
I'll wait.

01:25:29.351 --> 01:25:31.669
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, he might not want to see me.

01:25:32.266 --> 01:25:33.945
If he does, come get me.

01:25:34.165 --> 01:25:35.775
Alright.

01:25:51.856 --> 01:25:53.466
Hi, darling.

01:25:54.911 --> 01:25:55.929
Hey.

01:25:59.146 --> 01:26:01.038
How are you feeling?

01:26:09.376 --> 01:26:11.132
Doctor said you'll live.

01:26:12.708 --> 01:26:14.662
Do they have any good news?

01:26:21.974 --> 01:26:23.693
Roz is here.

01:26:24.148 --> 01:26:25.992
She'd love to see you.

01:26:26.582 --> 01:26:28.572
- No.
- Darling, she's...

01:26:28.597 --> 01:26:29.397
No.

01:26:31.478 --> 01:26:32.725
Hi.

01:26:36.515 --> 01:26:37.661
Hi.

01:26:43.551 --> 01:26:44.842
That's good.

01:26:46.148 --> 01:26:48.740
I'm better than those fucking crutches.

01:26:49.537 --> 01:26:51.801
I can get you some softer ones.

01:26:53.102 --> 01:26:55.293
I don't know why I bother.

01:26:58.363 --> 01:27:01.594
They say your spine is gonna be okay,
so that's good, right?

01:27:01.852 --> 01:27:05.609
Yeah, only a comparison to what
they're telling me about my leg.

01:27:08.910 --> 01:27:10.474
Just a bit left.

01:27:14.461 --> 01:27:15.833
Roz?

01:27:19.554 --> 01:27:20.763
Hey...

01:27:22.246 --> 01:27:23.802
What?

01:27:25.531 --> 01:27:27.566
You were calling out for Roz.

01:27:31.571 --> 01:27:33.857
Were you dreaming about her?

01:27:36.075 --> 01:27:37.661
I guess so.

01:27:40.076 --> 01:27:42.692
It's not surprising, really.

01:27:44.122 --> 01:27:46.409
I've known her my whole life.

01:27:47.906 --> 01:27:49.506
She's been like...

01:27:50.885 --> 01:27:52.967
Second mother to me.

01:28:03.518 --> 01:28:05.532
What would I do without you?

01:28:10.667 --> 01:28:13.278
I ssume that you'll be moving to Sidney?

01:28:13.732 --> 01:28:15.370
I like it here.

01:28:15.805 --> 01:28:17.398
I know, but...

01:28:17.435 --> 01:28:19.729
I have to travel where the work is...

01:28:19.950 --> 01:28:23.078
Mary's the same, so we can
base ourselves where we like.

01:28:24.059 --> 01:28:26.237
- Where is she now?
- Audition.

01:28:29.634 --> 01:28:32.304
How's it going with Hannah?

01:28:32.341 --> 01:28:33.787
It's going...

01:28:34.237 --> 01:28:35.690
Nowhere.

01:28:36.995 --> 01:28:38.161
She's great.

01:28:38.301 --> 01:28:40.351
She couldn't be nicer, I just...

01:28:41.965 --> 01:28:43.890
- You know.
- Yeah.

01:28:46.714 --> 01:28:49.628
Pretty soon I'm gonna
have to give her the elbow.

01:29:04.813 --> 01:29:06.516
- Hello.
- Hi.

01:29:06.671 --> 01:29:08.010
What are you doing here?

01:29:09.839 --> 01:29:11.897
I didn't want to tell you over the phone.

01:29:12.856 --> 01:29:14.287
Tell me what?

01:29:15.467 --> 01:29:17.142
I'm pregnant.

01:29:20.738 --> 01:29:22.110
Hey...

01:30:21.838 --> 01:30:24.360
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

01:30:29.553 --> 01:30:33.488
I think you don't need these wings to swim.

01:30:33.923 --> 01:30:35.989
You're gonna be able
to do it all by yourself.

01:30:36.194 --> 01:30:38.036
I know you will, ready?
Off you go.

01:31:28.565 --> 01:31:30.582
Take your glasses off.

01:31:31.630 --> 01:31:34.245
I don't like you hiding your eyes from me.

01:31:59.969 --> 01:32:02.460
Don't go in the water by yourself.

01:32:02.524 --> 01:32:03.802
What's going on?

01:32:03.859 --> 01:32:05.845
She's going to the water again.

01:32:05.903 --> 01:32:07.546
You've frighten her.

01:32:08.616 --> 01:32:12.119
- Can't you see she's frighten?
- I want my granny!

01:32:22.740 --> 01:32:23.809
Is this your hat?

01:32:23.845 --> 01:32:26.573
- Yeah...
- It's my hat.

01:32:34.144 --> 01:32:37.043
I don't think I have any plain bread.

01:32:37.610 --> 01:32:38.522
Red and white.

01:32:38.565 --> 01:32:41.670
Finish them all.

01:32:45.229 --> 01:32:46.415
Those were the best ones.

01:32:46.448 --> 01:32:48.328
You've probably have had
enough sun for one day.

01:32:48.468 --> 01:32:50.312
That's okay, I'll take them up
in a minute.

01:32:50.337 --> 01:32:52.532
That's alright, I'll do it.

01:32:55.262 --> 01:32:56.398
Come on.

01:32:56.464 --> 01:32:58.126
Sweetie...

01:32:58.743 --> 01:33:01.378
Why are we leaving?
No no no...

01:33:01.403 --> 01:33:03.531
Take the lolly.

01:33:03.651 --> 01:33:05.718
Granny!

01:33:05.838 --> 01:33:07.198
That's alright.

01:33:07.248 --> 01:33:10.128
Where's my granny?

01:33:10.613 --> 01:33:12.965
You got them over excited.

01:33:13.741 --> 01:33:16.103
No, we spoil them, it's what we do.

01:33:16.471 --> 01:33:18.865
It's what grandmothers supposed to do.

01:33:22.453 --> 01:33:25.492
You two are really pleased
with yourselves, aren't you?

01:33:31.386 --> 01:33:34.079
At our beach, at our magic beach...

01:33:34.145 --> 01:33:36.737
The old bed is cozy and white...

01:33:36.774 --> 01:33:40.528
To the sound of the ocean,
we sleep through the night.

01:33:41.795 --> 01:33:45.130
Adrift on the evening tide.

01:33:45.972 --> 01:33:47.261
That's it.

01:33:50.088 --> 01:33:51.260
Night night...

01:34:00.324 --> 01:34:03.626
I'm exhausted, you don't mind
if I skip dinner, do you?

01:34:03.700 --> 01:34:05.775
No, I will miss you.

01:34:06.266 --> 01:34:07.848
- See you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow.

01:34:07.899 --> 01:34:09.079
Sweet dreams.

01:34:09.116 --> 01:34:11.115
Night night, guys.

01:34:11.173 --> 01:34:13.914
So how long are you guys on the road for?

01:34:14.258 --> 01:34:18.089
I think I'm on the road for less than 6 weeks,
and you go back on...

01:34:18.148 --> 01:34:19.971
Wednesday.

01:34:20.462 --> 01:34:22.771
I can't believe the break's
gone by so fast.

01:34:23.335 --> 01:34:24.704
Will I see you before you go?

01:34:24.726 --> 01:34:26.300
- Yeah, I hope so.
- Good.

01:34:26.682 --> 01:34:28.366
- See you.
- Night.

01:34:28.762 --> 01:34:29.846
Bye.

01:34:32.346 --> 01:34:33.613
Bye, guys.

01:34:33.664 --> 01:34:35.444
- Bye, love.
- Bye mom.

01:34:58.700 --> 01:35:00.479
No, it's great.

01:35:00.998 --> 01:35:03.541
The only problem is now that
they built my part more and more,

01:35:03.962 --> 01:35:06.271
learning the lines everyday.
It's murder.

01:35:07.250 --> 01:35:09.558
Ken Pierce, he plays my dad, they had to...

01:35:09.580 --> 01:35:11.984
Do this storyline about
him going deaf so they

01:35:12.195 --> 01:35:14.075
can give him an ear piece
and feed him his lines.

01:35:14.444 --> 01:35:16.616
Ah, so that's why he looks
so bewildered all the time.

01:35:16.651 --> 01:35:19.408
I think he's pretty bewildered
at the best of times.

01:35:22.283 --> 01:35:25.366
Why don't you all drive back to
the hotel together? Ian can drive.

01:35:25.383 --> 01:35:26.467
Why is that?

01:35:26.877 --> 01:35:29.901
- I think you've had a bit of drink.
- I'm alright.

01:35:30.253 --> 01:35:32.286
You must be over the limit, Tom.

01:35:33.063 --> 01:35:34.527
Yeah, probably.

01:35:34.600 --> 01:35:37.420
Alright, I'll go for a walk
and sober up a bit.

01:35:37.441 --> 01:35:39.499
- No, I'll drive.
- That's fine.

01:35:39.619 --> 01:35:43.081
You stay and chat,
I'm gonna get a breath of fresh air.

01:35:43.323 --> 01:35:45.271
Do you girls want to go shopping tomorrow?

01:35:45.307 --> 01:35:47.717
- That sounds good.
- Go to that dress shop.

01:36:40.564 --> 01:36:42.740
Great idea.

01:36:46.357 --> 01:36:48.503
I want to speak to you, in private.

01:36:48.525 --> 01:36:50.158
- Ian...
- Now!

01:36:56.909 --> 01:36:58.956
I'll kill him!

01:36:59.593 --> 01:37:01.644
They really took you for a ride,
didn't they?

01:37:01.687 --> 01:37:04.048
You're telling me you never
even suspected them?

01:37:04.224 --> 01:37:06.604
How could you have been so stupid?

01:37:07.461 --> 01:37:10.282
You made a stop when we didn't have to.

01:37:11.072 --> 01:37:14.262
And all the time they,
Tom who was getting married.

01:37:14.298 --> 01:37:17.279
For fuck sake, and should have stopped,
they were just stringing you along,

01:37:17.341 --> 01:37:18.621
they were just pretending...

01:37:18.656 --> 01:37:21.910
And having sex whenever they felt like it,
and laughing at us behind our backs.

01:37:21.947 --> 01:37:24.197
And you're saying you had no idea
what was going on?

01:37:24.222 --> 01:37:24.825
That's enough.

01:37:24.826 --> 01:37:27.027
- Ian, we are not alone.
- What difference does it make?

01:37:28.452 --> 01:37:31.103
Ian, what are you taking about?

01:37:36.401 --> 01:37:38.452
I just walked across the
street and found your

01:37:38.716 --> 01:37:40.987
husband rolling around on the floor
with my mother.

01:37:41.012 --> 01:37:42.212
What?

01:37:43.137 --> 01:37:44.712
- You heard me.
- Ian...

01:37:44.887 --> 01:37:47.622
Don't fucking Ian me...

01:37:48.207 --> 01:37:50.002
As far as I'm concerned...

01:37:50.851 --> 01:37:52.859
This is all your fault.

01:37:55.495 --> 01:37:57.452
How could it be her fault?

01:38:02.805 --> 01:38:04.665
Don't you see, Hannah?

01:38:05.646 --> 01:38:07.287
They're lovers as well.

01:38:12.927 --> 01:38:14.186
Ian?

01:38:17.899 --> 01:38:19.739
It's not true, is it?

01:38:20.647 --> 01:38:22.763
Not anymore.

01:38:23.869 --> 01:38:25.758
She put a stop to it.

01:38:28.819 --> 01:38:31.372
I don't understand.

01:38:35.937 --> 01:38:38.097
It couldn't be simpler.

01:38:40.675 --> 01:38:42.835
My husband has betrayed me.

01:38:42.915 --> 01:38:45.156
Lied to me from day one.

01:38:46.181 --> 01:38:48.114
I'm gonna go and get Alice.

01:38:48.158 --> 01:38:51.650
And leave and I never want
to see any of you ever again.

01:38:52.441 --> 01:38:55.224
If you have any sense,
you'll come with me.

01:39:03.154 --> 01:39:04.918
Go on, then.

01:39:19.007 --> 01:39:21.775
Well I hope you're pleased with yourself.

01:39:24.653 --> 01:39:26.901
I just told the truth.

01:39:28.095 --> 01:39:29.591
That's all.

01:39:30.968 --> 01:39:32.264
That's all?

01:39:33.774 --> 01:39:36.666
And you think that's something
to be proud of?

01:39:38.314 --> 01:39:39.588
Somebody had to.

01:39:39.603 --> 01:39:43.455
No! Nobody had to unless they wanted to
cause as much damage as possible, Ian.

01:39:43.506 --> 01:39:44.801
Especially to Hannah.

01:39:44.919 --> 01:39:47.269
It wasn't going anywhere anyway.

01:39:49.239 --> 01:39:51.396
Probably best to make it quick and...

01:39:52.568 --> 01:39:54.047
Merciful?

01:39:54.648 --> 01:39:56.763
Is that your idea of merciful?

01:40:12.724 --> 01:40:15.968
- Granny...
- Don't you touch her.

01:40:16.349 --> 01:40:17.951
Granny...

01:40:22.199 --> 01:40:24.707
You're worse than he is, you know that?

01:40:25.835 --> 01:40:27.776
Tell Tom to stay away.

01:40:28.022 --> 01:40:29.516
I don't wanna see him.

01:40:29.838 --> 01:40:31.273
I'll tell him.

01:40:39.553 --> 01:40:41.515
Bye-bye sweetie.

01:41:53.209 --> 01:41:55.425
I don't think they're coming back.

01:42:08.819 --> 01:42:10.914
We did try, Roz.

01:42:13.140 --> 01:42:17.135
We really did,
we stopped the same time you did.

01:42:17.838 --> 01:42:19.771
We thought that was that.

01:42:27.265 --> 01:42:28.598
And then...

01:42:29.579 --> 01:42:31.695
We started it again just...

01:42:32.379 --> 01:42:34.495
A few weeks after the wedding.

01:42:34.993 --> 01:42:37.774
Mary was away auditioning and...

01:42:38.748 --> 01:42:41.040
Tom dropped by.

01:42:41.098 --> 01:42:42.902
The way he always did.

01:42:44.462 --> 01:42:47.472
And it just sort of happened.

01:42:48.721 --> 01:42:51.606
I didn't tell you because I thought...

01:42:52.880 --> 01:42:55.087
It wasn't gonna last.

01:42:56.332 --> 01:42:58.880
And then once we both realized it...

01:42:59.358 --> 01:43:00.808
was.

01:43:03.825 --> 01:43:06.405
It's just seem too late to tell you.

01:43:07.364 --> 01:43:09.041
Too hurtful.

01:43:12.123 --> 01:43:14.774
After the way you sacrificed Ian.

01:43:16.010 --> 01:43:19.071
And Tom really didn't want me to tell you.

01:43:19.949 --> 01:43:21.469
Because it was...

01:43:21.622 --> 01:43:23.109
It was so...

01:43:23.746 --> 01:43:25.716
Casual, you know?

01:43:30.461 --> 01:43:34.291
Sometimes we went weeks
without it, months...

01:43:41.810 --> 01:43:43.374
It was just...

01:43:44.033 --> 01:43:48.687
It was just important for us to
know that it hadn't gone away.

01:43:51.034 --> 01:43:53.787
That it was still alive.

01:43:57.083 --> 01:44:01.321
Christ, I felt like I would
suffocate if didn't have it.

01:44:06.481 --> 01:44:10.986
Then it was only possible with
Tom because he's so light, so easy.

01:44:11.015 --> 01:44:13.735
It couldn't have worked that way with Ian.

01:44:21.800 --> 01:44:24.262
Ian told me it was all my fault.

01:44:24.299 --> 01:44:27.601
Oh for God sake, he doesn't
know what's he talking about.

01:44:30.052 --> 01:44:34.137
You're the only one who
hasn't behaved badly.

01:44:36.861 --> 01:44:39.632
Then it probably is all my fault.

01:44:45.269 --> 01:44:46.822
Oh Roz.

01:45:40.252 --> 01:45:41.988
Morning.
