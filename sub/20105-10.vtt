00:01.002 --> 00:02.379
<i>Previously on</i> iZombie...

00:03.254 --> 00:04.422
Look, what I found
in my hate mail.

00:04.631 --> 00:08.218
"If you ever need
a sympathetic ear,
I've got two. Shawna."

00:09.052 --> 00:09.928
She's cute.

00:10.845 --> 00:14.432
This blue juice makes
zombie visions longer
and more intense.

00:14.641 --> 00:17.227
And if all goes according
to plan, it's going to make
us a lot of money.

00:17.769 --> 00:19.729
Harley and his people
are targeting zombies.

00:19.938 --> 00:23.858
I landed us an invite to
the zombie truthers
meeting tomorrow night.

00:24.067 --> 00:25.110
We're gonna capture a zombie.

00:25.318 --> 00:27.278
Let the whole world see
the monster it becomes!

00:29.656 --> 00:31.574
How long are you
gonna be in Seattle?

00:31.783 --> 00:34.452
Just long enough to get
my money and settle
some old debts.

00:38.331 --> 00:40.125
You're married to
someone for 30 years.

00:40.333 --> 00:41.584
You scrimp, and you save.

00:41.751 --> 00:43.670
And you build up a nest egg,
and then they die,

00:43.878 --> 00:45.755
and the nest egg is
nowhere to be found.

00:47.590 --> 00:50.010
Montenegro? Yeah, sure.

00:50.176 --> 00:51.344
Last week he was spotted

00:51.553 --> 00:52.887
in a regional production
of <i>Pippin</i>

00:53.138 --> 00:54.014
for the Tacoma Players.

00:54.222 --> 00:55.598
My husband is dead.

00:55.807 --> 00:57.767
Worst case,
there should be
insurance money.

00:59.686 --> 01:02.105
Well, you're our lawyer,
you figure it out!

01:34.095 --> 01:37.348
He'd better be dead.
That's all I'm saying.

01:38.516 --> 01:39.893
Shifty little weasel.

01:47.358 --> 01:48.568
Don't answer it!

01:50.612 --> 01:52.113
It's my roommate again.

01:52.322 --> 01:53.656
Calling to remind
me to set the DVR.

01:53.865 --> 01:54.532
No!

01:55.742 --> 01:56.659
<i>World's Deadliest Plants.</i>

01:56.868 --> 01:58.578
<i>Nat Geo.</i> Tomorrow.
Got you covered, bro.

01:58.787 --> 02:01.873
<i>Not why I'm calling.
Listen, my parents
got a wild hair,</i>

02:02.082 --> 02:03.541
<i>decided to renew
their wedding vows.</i>

02:03.750 --> 02:04.584
<i>My dad just called,</i>

02:04.793 --> 02:06.211
<i>surprised me with
a plane ticket to London.</i>

02:06.461 --> 02:07.879
Oh, that's so freaking good.

02:08.129 --> 02:09.547
<i>Uh, okay.</i>

02:09.798 --> 02:11.299
<i>So, I'll be back
in a few days.</i>

02:11.549 --> 02:13.760
<i>- Can you get word to Liv?</i>
- Totes magotes. Bye now!

02:17.097 --> 02:18.431
Cheers, then.

02:21.810 --> 02:23.394
Agenda's clear for a few days.

02:24.270 --> 02:26.439
Nice work,
Doctor Shockterbooty.

02:29.275 --> 02:29.984
Ah-ah!

02:32.237 --> 02:33.488
We're gonna need that phone.

02:34.072 --> 02:35.490
Is that really necessary?

02:35.698 --> 02:38.243
- I'm here of my own volition.
- Volition?

02:39.828 --> 02:41.037
His own free will.

02:41.246 --> 02:45.250
He's here because we've
a bunch of sawed-off shotguns.

02:46.167 --> 02:48.962
I'm here because I want to
study a zombie in the flesh.

02:49.504 --> 02:50.713
I believe you, Doc.

02:50.964 --> 02:53.925
But I'll still feel better
if I know you're focused on

02:54.134 --> 02:56.594
what we're doing here,
instead of...

02:58.721 --> 03:00.056
Playing <i>Candy Crush.</i>

03:02.433 --> 03:03.351
I get it.

03:04.144 --> 03:05.311
Keep my phone, then.

03:07.021 --> 03:08.356
I should, uh...

03:08.690 --> 03:09.774
Go check on him.

03:29.335 --> 03:30.795
Look at us now.

03:31.004 --> 03:32.505
We've got our exotic animal,

03:32.714 --> 03:35.091
strongman and
sideshow all in one.

03:36.676 --> 03:38.178
Move over <i>Barnum & Bailey.</i>

03:40.972 --> 03:42.932
We're about to put on
the greatest show on earth.

04:08.750 --> 04:10.877
Heart rate holding steady
at 10 beats per minute.

04:11.628 --> 04:12.795
Copy.

04:19.385 --> 04:20.720
Lookie here.
We got your wide shot

04:20.929 --> 04:23.890
but also your
extreme close-up,
mess-yourself money shot.

04:24.098 --> 04:25.475
And anyone around
the world doing a search

04:25.683 --> 04:27.352
- for zombies will find us?
- That's right.

04:27.560 --> 04:29.145
We're gonna starve
out our guest of honor

04:29.354 --> 04:30.897
until he goes
all gnarly on us,

04:31.105 --> 04:32.815
prove to the world
that zombies are for real.

04:33.024 --> 04:34.651
He ain't doing
anything worth watching.

04:35.276 --> 04:36.903
Let's rectify that.

04:37.111 --> 04:39.530
A cattle prod to the nards
ought to liven him up,

04:39.739 --> 04:42.617
get him all veiny and red-eyed
like he was in the van.

04:42.825 --> 04:45.745
Too soon.
Nobody's watching yet.

04:46.454 --> 04:47.872
I tell you what.

04:48.081 --> 04:49.540
We hit 100,000 views,

04:50.333 --> 04:52.168
we'll light him up
like a Christmas tree.

04:55.546 --> 04:58.341
Hear that, Zombie?
Don't get too comfortable.

04:58.549 --> 05:00.885
I'm coming for you!

05:01.094 --> 05:02.262
Whoo-hoo!

05:04.264 --> 05:05.890
Check out
this photo of Baracus

05:06.099 --> 05:08.226
protecting his son
from sniper's bullets.

05:08.434 --> 05:10.186
"Baracus shows
courage under fire."

05:10.353 --> 05:13.273
He could end up
being the first
zombie mayor of Seattle.

05:13.940 --> 05:15.441
That say anything
about leads on the shooter?

05:16.025 --> 05:16.985
Nope.

05:18.486 --> 05:19.988
Are you going
into the office today?

05:22.740 --> 05:24.575
- Why?
- General interest.

05:24.784 --> 05:27.161
You want to know if you can
have the place to yourself.

05:27.370 --> 05:28.371
Your words.

05:28.579 --> 05:29.998
You know,
you have your own room.

05:31.165 --> 05:32.875
Is zombie sex
particularly loud?

05:33.084 --> 05:35.128
What with
the groaning and growling?

05:35.336 --> 05:38.339
All I'm asking is
if you're going
into the office.

05:38.548 --> 05:40.091
How are things
on the Justin front?

05:40.800 --> 05:41.926
I mean you're highly-critical.

05:42.093 --> 05:44.554
You broke up with a guy once
because his O-face
made you laugh.

05:44.762 --> 05:47.181
If you had seen it, ugh!

05:47.390 --> 05:49.267
And on the Justin front,
I wouldn't know.

05:49.475 --> 05:52.103
- We haven't...
- Ah!

05:52.312 --> 05:54.063
I see why you want
the place to yourself.

05:55.356 --> 05:57.275
Okay. Well, um...

05:57.567 --> 05:59.110
What if I can
make you a better offer?

05:59.319 --> 06:00.611
I don't want you
to be insulted

06:00.820 --> 06:02.655
and don't think
I haven't considered it,

06:02.864 --> 06:05.158
but I'm going
to stick with men.

06:06.451 --> 06:07.493
Okay, here's the deal.

06:07.702 --> 06:09.412
I'll clear out
any night you want

06:09.704 --> 06:13.666
as long as you'll do me one
teensy-weensy favor today.

06:13.833 --> 06:15.376
- I'm listening...
- James Weckler...

06:15.585 --> 06:17.045
The dominatrix killer. Yeah.

06:17.253 --> 06:18.546
His brain is
currently marinating

06:18.713 --> 06:20.256
in Ravi's blue juice
down at the morgue.

06:21.299 --> 06:22.925
It's ripe and ready to go.

06:23.134 --> 06:25.011
- No, don't make me...
- Please.

06:25.219 --> 06:28.348
His confession came too easy.
You even said it yourself.

06:28.556 --> 06:30.308
His lawyer accepted
a terrible plea deal.

06:30.475 --> 06:32.018
Hinted sinister
forces were at work.

06:32.226 --> 06:34.062
Liv, I don't think
he killed Roxanne Greer.

06:34.270 --> 06:35.855
Okay. You want
me to find evidence

06:36.064 --> 06:38.191
that tears apart
the case Clive and I
made against Weckler.

06:38.441 --> 06:40.485
- Yes.
- You want me to live
inside the brain of a guy

06:40.693 --> 06:42.153
- who just hanged himself.
- Yes.

06:42.362 --> 06:43.780
A guy who
if I remember correctly,

06:43.988 --> 06:45.448
spent time
in a mental health facility.

06:45.656 --> 06:46.532
Yes. Also true.

06:46.783 --> 06:48.368
- For what?
- Hallucinations of
his dead wife.

06:48.618 --> 06:50.661
You can see
how this might not be
my first choice

06:50.870 --> 06:51.996
for how to spend a day off.

06:52.789 --> 06:55.416
Well, not with that attitude.

06:55.625 --> 06:57.585
Seeing justice done,
that's fun.

06:57.794 --> 07:00.380
Spending quality time
with Peyton, that's fun.

07:03.049 --> 07:04.467
You had me at justice.

07:23.027 --> 07:23.820
Anything?

07:25.029 --> 07:27.740
- Oh, my God!
- Nope. Not yet.

07:28.574 --> 07:29.742
Patience, lady.

07:37.125 --> 07:39.293
Man, I thought getting
scratched would be like...

07:39.794 --> 07:43.381
Winning the golden ticket.
But this candy factory blows.

07:50.930 --> 07:54.308
Huh? Hello? Ugh!

07:54.976 --> 07:56.936
It's like corrupt government
officials in Bangladesh

07:57.145 --> 07:58.771
don't even want to make money.

08:00.022 --> 08:02.400
I thought we'd be
like the kids
taking the tour, man.

08:02.608 --> 08:03.693
Look around you.

08:03.860 --> 08:05.528
We're the Oompa Loompas.

08:05.736 --> 08:07.864
- You're an Oompa Loompa.
- Yeah, man.

08:08.072 --> 08:09.490
That's what I just said.

08:10.158 --> 08:12.785
Hey, where the hell is Don E?

08:12.994 --> 08:14.871
He wandered out
into an alley last night,

08:15.079 --> 08:18.749
shouting something about
bombs being dropped
on a factory in Dusseldorf.

08:18.958 --> 08:20.543
He ate some of the blue brain?

08:22.170 --> 08:23.629
Lots. Like...

08:24.338 --> 08:25.339
Lots.

08:26.716 --> 08:28.634
Sergeant Hoyt Carroll!

08:30.761 --> 08:33.347
Serial number 580

08:33.598 --> 08:35.349
79086.

08:35.516 --> 08:37.226
You'll get nothing from me,
you dirty Krauts.

08:40.104 --> 08:42.106
You weren't laughing
after Big Week,
were you, Fritz?

08:42.315 --> 08:45.443
Our Mustangs blasting
your Stukas outta the sky!

08:45.943 --> 08:49.739
<i>♪ Oh, say can you see...</i>

08:49.947 --> 08:51.157
What the hell, Doc?

08:51.365 --> 08:53.159
Why is he acting like
he's on <i>Hogan's Heroes?</i>

08:53.951 --> 08:54.952
I have no idea.

08:55.703 --> 08:58.372
You think this thing's been
around since World War II?

08:59.123 --> 09:00.500
Maybe zombies live forever.

09:01.209 --> 09:02.418
Like vampires.

09:04.629 --> 09:08.508
<i>♪ Oh, say!
Does that star-spangled</i>

09:08.716 --> 09:12.428
<i>♪ Banner yet wave</i>

09:12.637 --> 09:19.310
<i>♪ O'er the land

09:25.900 --> 09:27.151
Get out here.

09:31.989 --> 09:33.783
I can't believe
I'm doing this.

09:33.991 --> 09:36.702
If I had to eat the brains
of a guy who sees ghosts,

09:37.036 --> 09:38.704
you can try to
trigger a vision for me

09:38.913 --> 09:40.498
by pretending
to be a dominatrix.

09:40.665 --> 09:42.667
Fresh out of whips. Improvise!

09:42.875 --> 09:44.919
Weckler killed
Roxanne in her dungeon,

09:45.127 --> 09:47.630
so, you know, discipline me.

09:47.838 --> 09:49.173
- For what?
- Well...

09:53.135 --> 09:55.096
I've been a naughty girl.

09:58.474 --> 10:00.601
That is some
weak sauce, Counselor.

10:00.810 --> 10:02.937
Looks like we found something
Peyton isn't good at.

10:03.145 --> 10:05.314
Oh, hell no.

10:05.898 --> 10:07.984
Take it back,
you filthy little piggy.

10:08.192 --> 10:09.569
- Ow!
- Shut up.

10:10.027 --> 10:11.988
Take it back,
you undead slut!

10:12.196 --> 10:15.157
Take it back or clean
my shoe with your tongue.

10:15.658 --> 10:17.660
- I'm not gonna...
- Do it or suffer!

10:17.868 --> 10:19.704
- Okay!
- Make it shine!

10:19.912 --> 10:21.872
Oh, you like that, don't you?

10:22.081 --> 10:24.625
You nasty, little pervert!

10:28.963 --> 10:30.131
Yes!

10:43.185 --> 10:44.020
Whoa!

10:46.105 --> 10:48.441
I'm afraid I've got
some bad news for you, Peyton.

10:49.442 --> 10:51.027
Weckler killed Roxanne.

10:51.444 --> 10:52.194
No!

10:52.403 --> 10:55.406
Roxanne caught him
as he was stealing
the camera memory card.

10:56.157 --> 10:58.868
She was calling for help
and he panicked
and strangled her.

10:59.744 --> 11:02.371
You know,
most prosecutors would
be happy that the person

11:02.580 --> 11:03.831
they put away
was actually guilty.

11:04.040 --> 11:06.792
Yeah, but my desire
to be right is even greater
than my desire to win.

11:07.793 --> 11:09.462
- Did you see his dead wife?
- Yeah.

11:09.920 --> 11:11.130
Unpleasant lady.

11:13.007 --> 11:17.428
So, Mistress P,
how much time
do I have left in my hour?

11:17.637 --> 11:19.889
Oh, you like it, do you?

11:20.973 --> 11:21.891
Me likey.

11:22.933 --> 11:24.268
Oh, my God, what?

11:24.477 --> 11:26.479
You think, uh, Peyton will
let you borrow that getup?

11:26.687 --> 11:27.897
You're dead.

11:29.106 --> 11:31.067
Who's dead?
Who are you talking to?

11:31.275 --> 11:32.443
Drake.

11:33.235 --> 11:34.403
Uh, Drake?

11:34.612 --> 11:35.613
Old boyfriend, Drake?

11:35.821 --> 11:37.740
No, Drake
the multi-platinum
hip hop star.

11:37.948 --> 11:40.284
All right, now.
You wanna get
spanked some more?

11:40.493 --> 11:41.577
Ooh, yes, please.

11:41.786 --> 11:44.288
Weckler felt guilty about
accidentally killing his wife.

11:44.497 --> 11:45.748
So, he hallucinated her...

11:45.956 --> 11:48.125
You're so sexy
when you're onto something.

11:48.334 --> 11:50.920
- But I don't feel
guilty about her death...
- Getting warmer...

11:51.128 --> 11:52.672
I feel guilty
about your death.

11:52.880 --> 11:55.007
Hotter, so hot.

11:55.216 --> 11:56.592
Because I shot
you in the head.

11:56.801 --> 11:57.968
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding!

12:00.096 --> 12:02.848
I'm sorry.
You must be so freaked out.

12:03.057 --> 12:05.393
Oh, watching my zombie
roommate talk to a ghost?

12:05.601 --> 12:06.977
That's just
what I call a Tuesday.

12:10.731 --> 12:11.899
- Hey.
- Here you go.

12:12.483 --> 12:13.859
Nice. Thanks man.

12:17.071 --> 12:18.239
Mmm!

12:19.448 --> 12:21.909
- Mmm-mmm!
- Oh, my God.

12:22.159 --> 12:23.953
This fort of ours
is giving me all the feels.

12:24.120 --> 12:25.204
Mmm!

12:25.413 --> 12:26.997
When I was a kid,
I went to this camp.

12:27.206 --> 12:29.291
Once a summer,
they'd take us half a mile
into the woods,

12:29.500 --> 12:30.626
and we'd rough it for a night.

12:30.793 --> 12:31.752
We did that
at Camp Skookum, too.

12:31.961 --> 12:32.795
Shut the front door!

12:33.003 --> 12:33.963
Camp Skookum!
You went there too?

12:34.171 --> 12:36.424
- For five years in a row.
- Good ol' Camp Skookum.

12:37.425 --> 12:40.136
Did you know that Skookum is
Chinook for good and solid,

12:40.761 --> 12:42.805
but also, a yeti-like
monster with a clawed foot?

12:43.013 --> 12:44.306
Um, who didn't know that?

12:44.515 --> 12:46.308
- Remember the camp song?
- Of course. Do you?

12:47.685 --> 12:48.936
<i>♪ Let's slather

12:49.145 --> 12:50.104
<i>♪ And use the bug spray too</i>

12:50.438 --> 12:52.565
<i>♪ Always have your EpiPen

12:52.773 --> 12:53.858
Hold on! Hold on! Hold on!

12:54.066 --> 12:55.735
Oh, okay fine.

12:55.901 --> 12:57.153
<i>♪ Don't share your

12:57.361 --> 12:59.280

<i>♪ And poison ivy in

13:02.450 --> 13:04.827
Something that adorable
had to be documented.

13:05.035 --> 13:06.120
Post it and die.

13:07.496 --> 13:09.081
Too late.
It's already on my Tumblr.

13:09.248 --> 13:11.000
Oh, my God,
look at all these comments.

13:11.500 --> 13:14.253
All your old football
teammates think you're
pretty cute, too.

13:14.462 --> 13:15.921
Mmm-hmm. Hey!

13:16.130 --> 13:18.883
Give me the phone
or suffer the consequences.

13:19.091 --> 13:20.259
Do your worst.

13:20.509 --> 13:23.345
Okay, but you're not
going to like it.

13:28.225 --> 13:31.020
Let me go, you inbred turds!

13:31.228 --> 13:33.189
He doesn't think
we're Nazis anymore.

13:33.397 --> 13:34.648
It's progress.

13:34.857 --> 13:36.734
Harley wants you
to dial back the sedative.

13:36.942 --> 13:38.819
Our views have started spiking
since he's been awake.

13:39.028 --> 13:41.197
Just give him enough
to keep him docile.

13:41.989 --> 13:42.907
Got it.

13:44.909 --> 13:47.703
Oh, come closer, please!

13:47.912 --> 13:50.372
You've made
a serious mistake, son!

13:51.081 --> 13:53.125
You've kidnapped
the wrong guy.

13:53.334 --> 13:55.753
I promise this ends with me
feasting on someone's brains.

13:56.212 --> 13:57.546
Don E, shh!

13:58.214 --> 14:00.299
- Wait, I know you.
- Act like you don't.

14:00.549 --> 14:04.595
- That fruity accent. Ravi?
- Shh!

14:04.804 --> 14:06.555
I'm going to figure out a way
to get us both out of here.

14:06.764 --> 14:08.974
These guys want
to prove to the world
that zombies exist.

14:09.183 --> 14:10.351
<i>You're on a livestream.</i>

14:14.146 --> 14:15.731
I'm hungry,
if you know what I mean.

14:15.940 --> 14:16.857
That's kind of the point.

14:17.066 --> 14:18.901
They're going to starve you
past the point of no return.

14:19.109 --> 14:20.694
That doesn't sound
like fun at all.

14:20.861 --> 14:22.947
Hey, they didn't find
the burner phone
that Blaine gave me.

14:23.155 --> 14:24.323
That's great. Where is it?

14:24.532 --> 14:25.866
You about
done in there, yet?

14:26.951 --> 14:28.536
It's only saline. Act sleepy.

14:30.621 --> 14:31.789
I'll be back.

14:44.218 --> 14:45.469
<i>I used to think
being ghosted</i>

14:45.678 --> 14:47.471
<i>was a rude way
to end a relationship.</i>

14:47.638 --> 14:49.932
<i>But I'd much prefer the
millennial way of doing things</i>

14:50.140 --> 14:52.142
<i>to an old-timey
style haunting.</i>

14:52.810 --> 14:56.188
<i>Because this whole,
ghosts-of-boyfriends
I-shot-in-the-head thing?</i>

14:56.897 --> 14:58.148
<i>Really not working for me.</i>

14:58.357 --> 15:01.485
<i>There's gotta be another brain
no one's doing
anything with around here.</i>

15:08.617 --> 15:11.203
I'll make it easy for you.

15:11.412 --> 15:13.747
Cause of death,
single bullet to the brain.

15:13.998 --> 15:15.583
You'd gone full Romero.

15:15.791 --> 15:16.876
There was no
you left to kill.

15:17.084 --> 15:18.586
You were already gone.

15:18.794 --> 15:20.296
Whatever helps
you sleep at night, Liv.

15:20.546 --> 15:21.380
Oh, no.

15:21.589 --> 15:23.924
This is some
repressed guilt malarkey.

15:24.133 --> 15:25.593
You're here
because you're sexy!

15:25.801 --> 15:28.762
- You're a sex fantasy!
- Um...

15:30.431 --> 15:33.142
Sorry to interrupt.

15:33.350 --> 15:34.894
I had news to share.

15:35.102 --> 15:36.270
I know this looks weird,

15:36.478 --> 15:38.480
but there's
a simple explanation.

15:39.356 --> 15:41.400
I ate
the blue juice-soaked brain
of James Weckler,

15:41.609 --> 15:42.693
the guy we put away
for the murder

15:42.902 --> 15:44.361
of Roxanne Greer,
the dominatrix.

15:44.570 --> 15:45.779
Weckler used to have visions

15:45.946 --> 15:47.197
of the wife
he killed in a car crash,

15:47.406 --> 15:48.490
and now I'm seeing Drake,

15:48.699 --> 15:51.201
my ex-boyfriend,
who I thought
might be a criminal,

15:51.410 --> 15:53.579
but was
really an undercover
police detective.

15:53.787 --> 15:55.998
He's here? Now?

15:56.206 --> 15:57.041
He's right there.

15:58.626 --> 16:00.169
Liv, you ready
to grab some lunch?

16:00.377 --> 16:01.545
I'm dying for sushi.

16:06.091 --> 16:08.427
- It's a vision.
- Yep.

16:15.351 --> 16:17.227
- It's a long one.
- Hmm.

16:17.937 --> 16:20.564
- Blue juice brain.
- Got it.

16:24.318 --> 16:25.486
What the hell just happened?

16:25.736 --> 16:27.613
In my vision,
I was getting hanged.

16:27.821 --> 16:28.864
Getting hanged?

16:29.448 --> 16:30.950
- Not hanging yourself?
- Yep.

16:32.826 --> 16:34.328
So Weckler
didn't commit suicide.

16:34.536 --> 16:35.579
He was murdered.

16:36.246 --> 16:38.457
- Did you see who did it?
- She never does.

16:40.417 --> 16:41.794
I was hanging there,

16:42.002 --> 16:44.171
gasping for
air in my jail cell.

16:45.172 --> 16:47.174
I could see the shadow
of the man behind me.

16:48.258 --> 16:50.135
His hat, his walkie-talkie...

16:51.095 --> 16:52.346
It was a guard.

16:54.765 --> 16:57.059
Dun, dun, dun!

16:57.726 --> 16:59.979
I told you,
I didn't see a thing.

17:00.187 --> 17:01.563
You're the fifth guard
we've talked to

17:01.772 --> 17:04.650
working the night Weckler died
who didn't see a thing.

17:04.858 --> 17:07.194
- How is that possible?
- Beats me.

17:07.611 --> 17:09.279
You got yourselves
a real puzzle.

17:10.114 --> 17:11.824
Look,
I'm gonna be late for work.

17:13.158 --> 17:14.535
Thanks for your help.
You can go.

17:17.705 --> 17:19.289
Well, that was
a waste of time.

17:19.957 --> 17:21.834
- Look who's joining us.
- Hey, team.

17:22.042 --> 17:23.794
I may have found
something interesting.

17:24.044 --> 17:25.963
It's a call
Weckler made from jail

17:26.130 --> 17:28.007
to his daughter the day
before he was murdered.

17:28.757 --> 17:29.925
<i>Are they
keeping you fed, honey?</i>

17:30.134 --> 17:31.760
<i>Yeah, Dad. I'm fine.</i>

17:31.969 --> 17:33.721
<i>They made you do it,
didn't they?</i>

17:33.929 --> 17:35.139
<i>Leave it alone, Tatum.</i>

17:36.682 --> 17:38.100
So who's the they?

17:38.308 --> 17:39.351
That's what
I'm trying to figure out.

17:39.560 --> 17:40.769
We need to find
that memory card

17:40.978 --> 17:42.396
Weckler stole from
Roxanne's dungeon.

17:42.604 --> 17:44.857
The one with all her clients
getting spanked and whatnot.

17:45.065 --> 17:46.191
Let's track
Weckler's daughter down,

17:46.400 --> 17:47.526
see if she
can shed some light.

17:47.735 --> 17:49.361
I've tried calling,
but it just goes
straight to voicemail.

17:49.528 --> 17:51.030
Give me the number,
I'll see what I can do.

17:51.989 --> 17:53.198
Thanks.

17:53.407 --> 17:54.825
Anybody interested
in grabbing dinner?

17:55.409 --> 17:56.702
I can't. I have plans.

17:56.910 --> 17:58.954
But you two
should go for a long dinner.

17:59.371 --> 18:00.831
Maybe then go back
to Clive's place

18:01.081 --> 18:02.249
and listen to
<i>Dark Side of the Moon</i>

18:02.458 --> 18:04.543
over and over until
you really understand it.

18:04.752 --> 18:06.628
And then you can explain
it to me at work tomorrow.

18:06.837 --> 18:08.213
She's got a boy coming over.

18:08.422 --> 18:09.715
Oh, I can explain
<i>Dark Side of the Moon</i>

18:09.923 --> 18:11.050
for you right now, Liv.

18:11.216 --> 18:13.343
See, the album
explores themes of

18:13.552 --> 18:15.721
- greed and mental illness.
- I'm out of here.

18:17.556 --> 18:19.892
After founding member,
Syd Barrett left the band...

18:20.100 --> 18:21.351
Tell me over a steak.

18:21.560 --> 18:22.895
You said the magic word.

18:36.325 --> 18:38.160
- Oh!
- Oh, too much?

18:38.368 --> 18:39.578
Bow-chicka-bow-wow.

18:39.787 --> 18:42.039
No, it's not you.
It's my ex-boyfriend.

18:42.247 --> 18:43.791
What do you think
this guy benches?

18:43.999 --> 18:46.710
Wait, so you're kissing me
but thinking about your ex?

18:46.919 --> 18:48.837
No! Of course not!
I'm hallucinating him.

18:49.088 --> 18:50.297
Can he fix a sink?

18:50.464 --> 18:51.882
Recite every Green Day lyric?

18:52.091 --> 18:53.217
Make you make
that special sound?

18:53.425 --> 18:56.345
Well, we're never
gonna know with you
hanging out here with us.

18:56.970 --> 18:59.264
Okay, what's happening here?

18:59.932 --> 19:01.850
I ate a brain of a guy
who had mental health issues,

19:02.059 --> 19:03.310
and now my
deceased ex-boyfriend

19:03.519 --> 19:05.354
is randomly showing up.

19:05.562 --> 19:06.772
Okay, well, um...

19:07.689 --> 19:09.900
Can you ask him
to give us some privacy?

19:11.276 --> 19:13.403
- No.
- It's a no go.

19:14.613 --> 19:15.364
Ah!

19:16.448 --> 19:17.407
Okay.

19:21.578 --> 19:23.497
So, what do we do now?

19:23.705 --> 19:25.124
Anyone got a pottery wheel?

19:26.875 --> 19:29.461
Can you
get that, Candy?

19:30.629 --> 19:31.839
Candy?

19:37.719 --> 19:39.179
- Oh!
- Surprise!

19:41.557 --> 19:43.308
Did you want
some time to monologue?

19:43.517 --> 19:44.643
Beg for your life?

19:46.311 --> 19:47.980
Did you think you could
cut in on my business,

19:48.188 --> 19:49.898
take out my boys,
and that would be that?

19:51.525 --> 19:54.611
You dream of
something for so long,

19:54.820 --> 19:57.698
you start to fear
that when you
finally get to experience it,

19:58.490 --> 20:00.784
it might not live up to
expectations. But...

20:02.703 --> 20:03.996
So far so good.

20:05.205 --> 20:08.000
Don't you dare!

20:08.208 --> 20:10.878
Bad timing, honey.
Don't take this personally.

20:14.631 --> 20:17.217
- What the...
- You know what?

20:17.426 --> 20:20.596
I'm real tired
of getting shot.

20:32.441 --> 20:34.359
Oh, boo!
I thought you were food.

20:34.568 --> 20:36.445
Nope, not food. I'm Liv.

20:37.154 --> 20:39.364
- And you are?
- Shawna. Major's...

20:39.573 --> 20:41.116
Let's just say friend.

20:43.911 --> 20:45.370
- Maybe you're food.
- Huh?

20:45.913 --> 20:48.290
I just came to pick up
his roommate's key.

20:48.498 --> 20:50.542
- Oh, Ravi? He's out of town.
- Yeah, I know.

20:50.751 --> 20:52.419
That's why,
I came to get his key.

20:52.669 --> 20:54.087
Is it cool that you
come in like this?

20:54.338 --> 20:55.547
I'm sorry, it's just,
I don't know who you are.

20:55.756 --> 20:56.715
What's this?

20:59.009 --> 21:00.761
- We dubbed it Fort Lust.
- Huh...

21:01.011 --> 21:02.346
It's our special hideaway.

21:04.681 --> 21:07.059
Oh, hey, Liv.

21:07.267 --> 21:09.811
Hey,
I just came to pick up
Ravi's supply closet key.

21:10.020 --> 21:11.813
Yeah, yeah.
I think it's right here.

21:14.524 --> 21:17.527
Whoo!
It reeks of sex in here.

21:19.279 --> 21:23.867
Well, I know some rats
that won't feed themselves.

21:24.910 --> 21:26.036
You kids have fun.

21:26.703 --> 21:27.955
Yes, I hear you.

21:28.163 --> 21:30.040
I was fooling around
with Major's army buddy

21:30.249 --> 21:32.376
just last night,
so I've got no room to talk,

21:32.626 --> 21:35.170
but c'mon, Fort Lust?

21:35.379 --> 21:36.546
I'm not allowed
to get upset about that?

21:40.175 --> 21:41.260
What did you hear?

21:41.468 --> 21:44.221
Just something
about Fort Lust.

21:44.429 --> 21:46.014
I assumed you were
in here talking to Drake.

21:46.223 --> 21:48.392
That's right. I am. Uh...

21:48.600 --> 21:49.810
Drake is right there,

21:50.018 --> 21:52.020
and Fort Lust is a place
that he used to take me.

21:52.479 --> 21:53.397
It's a euphemism.

21:54.356 --> 21:55.607
God, I hope so.

21:56.275 --> 21:58.694
Well, that'll be all, Drake.
Be gone!

21:59.486 --> 22:01.280
- We're alone now.
- Great.

22:02.281 --> 22:04.449
I think we caught
a lucky break.

22:04.658 --> 22:05.826
A prisoner is claiming

22:06.076 --> 22:08.078
he can ID the guard
who killed Weckler.

22:08.287 --> 22:10.747
- That's amazing!
- Yeah, but he wants a deal.

22:10.998 --> 22:12.666
- What's he in for?
- Weapons charges,

22:12.874 --> 22:14.710
B and E,
assaulting an officer.

22:14.918 --> 22:16.420
How badly was
the officer hurt?

22:17.254 --> 22:18.839
She came through it okay.

22:22.092 --> 22:23.844
I want to be
perfectly clear about this.

22:24.344 --> 22:25.971
Mr. Jin must
provide us with information

22:26.179 --> 22:27.514
that leads to
the successful prosecution

22:27.764 --> 22:28.765
of James Weckler's killer

22:28.974 --> 22:30.517
in order for us
to commute his sentence.

22:33.687 --> 22:36.606
This clown? Oh, hell no.

22:37.024 --> 22:37.899
This is her case?

22:38.317 --> 22:41.320
Take me back to jail then.
I'd rather do the time
than help her make a collar.

22:41.528 --> 22:43.238
Whoa, there. This is my case.

22:43.447 --> 22:44.990
Ms. Moore is
a medical examiner.

22:45.198 --> 22:46.908
They're all my cases.

22:47.117 --> 22:48.535
Not helping, Liv.

22:48.744 --> 22:50.120
You don't get it.

22:50.329 --> 22:52.497
This chick is a mutant.

22:54.291 --> 22:56.668
- A mutant?
- That's what I said.

22:56.877 --> 22:59.463
We tussled,
her eyes went red
and her face got all...

23:00.005 --> 23:01.757
- Mutant-ish.
- Mutant-ish?

23:01.965 --> 23:04.468
Lady, will you stop repeating
my words like I'm crazy.

23:04.676 --> 23:06.928
I kicked his ass,
that's all that happened.

23:07.137 --> 23:08.597
If he wants to
give me super powers

23:08.805 --> 23:11.183
to make himself feel better,
then I say let him.

23:11.391 --> 23:13.685
I'm interested in hearing more
about these mutant powers.

23:13.894 --> 23:16.146
- Did she know martial arts?
- Damn right, she did.

23:16.355 --> 23:17.356
She was skilled.

23:17.564 --> 23:18.774
As skilled as
a ninja, perhaps?

23:18.982 --> 23:20.901
- Totally.
- She's a mutant ninja.

23:21.151 --> 23:24.112
Did she have a round shell,
hankering for pizza?

23:25.197 --> 23:27.199
- Ninja, please.
- Mr. Jin.

23:27.407 --> 23:29.159
Let's try to keep
your testimony credible.

23:29.701 --> 23:31.953
Please tell them
what they need to know.

23:32.496 --> 23:34.915
- The testimony?
- Right.

23:35.123 --> 23:36.375
I got this telescoping mirror

23:36.541 --> 23:38.794
so I can talk to the guys
in the cells next to me.

23:39.002 --> 23:41.171
The night he died,
I heard a noise
coming from Weckler's cell,

23:41.380 --> 23:44.466
and in that mirror,
I saw this fat-ass guard...

23:44.674 --> 23:46.176
Gary Oberman.

23:46.385 --> 23:48.470
He was hanging
Weckler with a belt.

23:48.678 --> 23:50.722
Haven't seen the dude
on duty since that night.

23:50.931 --> 23:52.808
We never talked
to a guard named Oberman.

23:54.184 --> 23:56.103
We should track him down
and make a house call.

24:04.861 --> 24:06.321
Looks like
we're party crashers.

24:09.032 --> 24:10.117
You two.

24:10.325 --> 24:12.035
We're looking
for Gary Oberman.

24:12.244 --> 24:13.954
Well,
we'll see what we can do.

24:14.746 --> 24:15.914
C'mon in.

24:22.254 --> 24:24.214
Dear God,
I think this is a wake.

24:27.801 --> 24:29.010
Excuse me.
Do I know you?

24:29.219 --> 24:31.513
These two cops
were looking for Gary.

24:31.721 --> 24:34.141
Mrs. Oberman,
I'm Clive and this is Liv.

24:37.060 --> 24:38.061
Do you mind?

24:39.354 --> 24:41.314
Could we ask
you a few questions?

24:42.190 --> 24:44.192
We're looking into
an incident at the county jail

24:44.443 --> 24:45.902
that may have
involved your husband.

24:51.491 --> 24:52.617
May we ask how he died?

24:52.868 --> 24:54.995
I don't know.
Well, not for sure.

24:55.203 --> 24:56.246
Excuse me?

24:56.455 --> 24:57.372
A couple of weeks ago,

24:57.581 --> 25:01.126
Gary surprised me
with a cruise to
the Mexican Riviera.

25:01.334 --> 25:02.461
He fell overboard.

25:03.837 --> 25:05.046
You know how common that is?

25:05.255 --> 25:07.591
They're usually
murders or suicides.

25:07.841 --> 25:09.217
Did anyone see it happen?

25:09.468 --> 25:13.263
No, but Gary'd had
more than a few margaritas,

25:13.472 --> 25:15.432
and another passenger reported

25:15.640 --> 25:19.019
seeing him up
on the bow shouting,
"I'm the king of the world."

25:21.563 --> 25:23.899
What does this case
have to do with Gary?

25:24.107 --> 25:25.859
We're investigating
the murder of a prisoner

25:26.067 --> 25:28.653
that took place on Gary's
last night on the job.

25:28.862 --> 25:31.031
A prisoner? Why bother?
Gary used to say,

25:31.239 --> 25:33.074
all those prisoners
were just human garbage.

25:33.283 --> 25:34.993
Sorry, I gotta take it.

25:41.458 --> 25:44.586
So, "human garbage," you say?

25:45.462 --> 25:46.880
I appreciate you
getting back to me.

25:47.088 --> 25:48.423
I'll let you
know what I learn.

25:48.632 --> 25:50.050
All right, then. Bye.

25:51.176 --> 25:53.386
That was
Tatum Weckler's grandmother.

25:53.595 --> 25:55.096
She told me
after Weckler's death,

25:55.305 --> 25:57.933
Tatum moved in with the family
of one of her friends
here in Seattle,

25:58.141 --> 25:59.476
so she wouldn't
have to change schools.

25:59.684 --> 26:02.103
Makes sense.
Poor kid's life's
been disrupted enough.

26:02.312 --> 26:05.148
She gave me an address
since Tatum isn't
answering her cell.

26:05.357 --> 26:06.274
Let's run by there now.

26:06.483 --> 26:08.235
This case just
keeps getting weirder.

26:08.443 --> 26:10.862
First Weckler kills Roxanne,
then Gary kills Weckler.

26:11.071 --> 26:12.822
Then Gary comes into
a large sum of money,

26:13.031 --> 26:14.991
goes on a cruise
and disappears into thin air.

26:15.200 --> 26:17.744
Seems like someone is
trying to clean up a mess,

26:17.994 --> 26:19.538
by making an even bigger one.

26:29.839 --> 26:32.175
Nearly 65,000 viewers!

26:33.343 --> 26:35.136
This is about to get fun.

26:35.345 --> 26:36.763
I'm already having a blast.

26:39.140 --> 26:41.017
You wanna know
where zombies come from?

26:43.019 --> 26:44.354
Oh, I do.

26:47.649 --> 26:49.985
The Shah of Iran.

26:50.902 --> 26:53.947
- Would not have been
my first guess.
- Hear me out.

26:54.155 --> 26:55.657
He was building a zombie army

26:55.865 --> 26:57.742
to protect himself
from his own people.

26:57.993 --> 27:00.620
But before he could unleash
his army of the undead,

27:00.829 --> 27:03.206
the Ayatollah seized power

27:03.373 --> 27:05.333
and got his hands
on the zombie virus.

27:05.542 --> 27:08.253
Of course, the first thing
the Ayatollah wants to do

27:08.461 --> 27:11.298
is take out the great Satan.

27:11.506 --> 27:13.258
So the hardliners in Tehran

27:13.425 --> 27:15.343
bankroll Vaughn Du Clark...

27:17.137 --> 27:18.346
And Max Rager.

27:26.062 --> 27:26.688
Why?

27:26.896 --> 27:29.566
So they could infect
the movers and shakers first.

27:29.774 --> 27:31.610
These athletic zombies
would have no problem

27:31.818 --> 27:33.236
chasing down couch potatoes.

27:34.321 --> 27:37.657
It all seems
obvious when you
say it out loud like that.

27:42.203 --> 27:45.165
Mmm, time to take
the edge off this old boy.

27:46.082 --> 27:47.292
Yep.

27:49.461 --> 27:50.670
See that vein in his neck?

27:50.879 --> 27:52.922
It becomes more distinct
when he leans forward.

28:05.727 --> 28:06.895
Where's that phone
Blaine gave you?

28:07.103 --> 28:09.314
- I'm so hungry, Ravi.
- The phone!

28:11.441 --> 28:13.568
It's taped
between my butt cheeks.

28:13.777 --> 28:16.196
- Come again?
- They didn't find it,
did they?

28:24.829 --> 28:27.165
- Oh!
- Pardon the swamp ass.

28:27.374 --> 28:29.167
I didn't get
a chance to powder.

28:29.376 --> 28:30.543
Oh!

28:35.548 --> 28:36.675
Seriously?

28:37.425 --> 28:38.927
I am your only chance
of escape at the moment.

28:39.135 --> 28:40.762
So I'd strongly
reconsider trying to eat me.

28:40.970 --> 28:42.347
I'm sorry.

28:43.473 --> 28:45.850
Now that I think about it,
my phone's in my sock.

29:00.198 --> 29:01.449
Be home, Liv.

29:02.367 --> 29:03.576
Okay.

29:04.536 --> 29:06.663
Two-one-three-five...

29:06.830 --> 29:08.123
Or maybe it's three-seven.

29:09.999 --> 29:11.167
Eight-six-seven-five...

29:11.418 --> 29:12.585
Oh, bloody hell!

29:12.752 --> 29:14.671
You can't remember
any numbers, huh?

29:14.879 --> 29:16.631
That's modern living for you.

29:17.507 --> 29:19.592
I've got Blaine's number
programed in there.

29:21.386 --> 29:22.554
They've stopped
shooting out there.

29:22.762 --> 29:23.888
They'll be back soon.

29:24.097 --> 29:25.390
<i>- Blaine here.</i>
- It's Ravi.

29:25.598 --> 29:27.016
- It's an emergency...
<i>- Psych.</i>

29:27.225 --> 29:28.727
<i>I'm too busy to get
to my phone right now.</i>

29:28.935 --> 29:29.769
<i>Leave a message.</i>

29:29.978 --> 29:31.646
Oh, for God's sake.

29:47.954 --> 29:49.664
Did you have
a nice nap, Stacey?

29:50.582 --> 29:52.542
Look at you
all snug as a bug in a rug

29:52.751 --> 29:55.378
in our
Blissful Hereafter Model
in mahogany!

29:56.087 --> 29:59.174
- We can save you a few bucks
if you'd prefer birch.
- I shot you.

29:59.382 --> 30:00.842
I slit your throat.
We buried you.

30:01.050 --> 30:03.344
Mmm-hmm.
And, yet, here I am.

30:03.887 --> 30:05.096
How the hell
are you still alive?

30:05.263 --> 30:07.182
Well, I'm eating
a human brain.

30:08.391 --> 30:11.186
So, that makes me a...

30:11.436 --> 30:14.022
- Cannibal?
- Technically, I suppose,

30:14.230 --> 30:16.232
but that's not the answer
I'm looking for.

30:16.483 --> 30:17.901
I'm eating a human brain,

30:18.485 --> 30:22.197
I'm indestructible,
therefore, I am a...

30:22.822 --> 30:25.658
- A serial killer?
- Again, technically.

30:26.743 --> 30:27.786
You know what, hell with it.

30:27.994 --> 30:30.789
I'm here. I'm a zombie.

30:31.372 --> 30:32.582
Get used to it.

30:34.459 --> 30:36.044
Fine. You're a zombie.

30:36.252 --> 30:37.462
I'm Santa Claus,

30:37.670 --> 30:38.713
and if you let me out of here,

30:38.922 --> 30:40.215
I'm prepared
to give you presents

30:40.423 --> 30:41.758
beyond your wildest dreams.

30:41.925 --> 30:43.301
Bad news, Stace.

30:44.093 --> 30:45.929
My little elves
already found your sleigh,

30:47.180 --> 30:49.557
and all the gifts inside.

30:50.934 --> 30:54.604
- Oh, damn, that's pretty.
- Sorry.

30:54.854 --> 30:56.022
Don E keeps calling.

30:59.609 --> 31:01.236
- What?
<i>- It's Ravi. Listen up.</i>

31:01.486 --> 31:02.529
Don E and I are
being held hostage

31:02.737 --> 31:04.072
by zombie hunters
at Wham Bams Gun Range.

31:04.280 --> 31:05.573
Whoa, whoa. Slow down.
That's a lot to process.

31:05.782 --> 31:07.575
Process this!
They're starving Don E

31:07.784 --> 31:09.994
until he turns Romero
and broadcasting it
on a livestream.

31:10.203 --> 31:12.789
I'm kind of
in the middle
of something big.

31:18.169 --> 31:19.337
Just get here.

31:28.596 --> 31:31.558
Look I know your situation
may look dire here, Stacey,

31:31.766 --> 31:32.892
but you have options.

31:33.101 --> 31:34.477
Sure,
and one of those options
involves you

31:34.686 --> 31:36.729
being buried alive
in this overpriced box...

31:38.398 --> 31:42.026
But the other
leaves you alive,

31:42.235 --> 31:45.154
and provides you with
what I'm proud to say is a...

31:45.321 --> 31:47.615
Truly remarkable
business opportunity.

31:48.324 --> 31:49.826
So, would you
like to hear more

31:50.034 --> 31:52.287
about that once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity?

31:52.912 --> 31:54.414
Listen to
your business plan, huh?

31:56.541 --> 31:57.750
What was option one again?

32:00.211 --> 32:02.505
- Look who I found!
- I caught the livestream.

32:02.714 --> 32:04.299
Had to see it
with my own eyes.

32:05.508 --> 32:07.802
Oh, man, is it rank in here.

32:08.011 --> 32:09.554
Doc, you remember Rachel,
from the meeting?

32:09.762 --> 32:10.471
Hey.

32:13.850 --> 32:15.101
Holy hell!

32:16.644 --> 32:17.896
A zombie.

32:18.104 --> 32:19.314
How many beers
did this one have?

32:20.607 --> 32:21.858
He was sucking them down.

32:23.067 --> 32:24.736
Eighty-one thousand views.

32:25.361 --> 32:26.821
They're coming in fast now.

32:27.322 --> 32:28.531
It's almost show time!

32:35.288 --> 32:36.581
Do you know
what you're looking at?

32:37.582 --> 32:39.042
- A brain.
- Wrong.

32:39.751 --> 32:41.544
$25,000.

32:41.753 --> 32:44.339
This can sustain
a zombie for a month.

32:44.547 --> 32:47.342
Forget Truffles.
Forget Utopium.

32:47.550 --> 32:49.302
Brains are the future.

32:51.638 --> 32:54.015
This is your chance
to get in on the ground floor

32:54.223 --> 32:56.184
of something truly special.
You see...

32:56.392 --> 32:58.770
Zombies are
about to become a thing.

32:58.978 --> 33:00.688
What exactly makes
one a zombie?

33:00.897 --> 33:03.024
Is it an attitude? A style?

33:03.274 --> 33:05.360
One need only contract
the zombie virus.

33:05.568 --> 33:06.861
And you know
what a virus does?

33:08.112 --> 33:09.656
It spreads.

33:09.864 --> 33:11.366
Let me show you
some projections.

33:12.283 --> 33:13.534
You know what?

33:15.203 --> 33:17.372
I think I'm gonna pass on
this golden opportunity.

33:17.580 --> 33:19.582
Now if you could do me
the common courtesy of dying,

33:19.791 --> 33:20.959
I'll take my leave.

33:27.215 --> 33:29.550
I don't think you see
the potential here, Stacey.

33:30.134 --> 33:31.094
Here's what I propose.

33:32.804 --> 33:35.807
You excel at moving
contraband around the globe.

33:36.182 --> 33:38.142
I need brains from abroad.

33:38.643 --> 33:40.853
You'll be my international
business partner.

33:41.396 --> 33:43.106
In a year, you'll earn back

33:43.356 --> 33:44.857
all the goodies
in that briefcase.

33:45.108 --> 33:47.777
But, by then,
we'll have raked
in so much profit

33:47.986 --> 33:50.363
that it'll just be walking
around money, you know.

34:00.289 --> 34:01.457
When do I start?

34:05.628 --> 34:08.172
Hello. We're with
the Seattle Police Department.

34:08.423 --> 34:10.341
We're looking
for Tatum Weckler.
Is she around?

34:10.508 --> 34:12.885
Tatum! Cops! Here to see you!

34:14.721 --> 34:16.639
- What's going on?
- Hi, Tatum.

34:16.848 --> 34:19.225
I'm Liv Moore,
this is Detective Babineaux.

34:19.434 --> 34:21.561
We'd like to ask you a few
questions about your dad.

34:22.145 --> 34:23.896
I don't like
talking about him.

34:24.105 --> 34:25.523
You heard her. <i>Sayonara.</i>

34:25.732 --> 34:27.608
He didn't kill himself,
you know.

34:29.610 --> 34:30.862
Why do you think that?

34:32.447 --> 34:34.157
Can we get
a little privacy, please?

34:39.370 --> 34:40.788
You talked to
your father on the phone

34:40.997 --> 34:42.457
on the day
before he was killed.

34:42.665 --> 34:46.044
You asked him if they made
him kill Roxanne Greer.

34:46.711 --> 34:47.837
Who's they?

34:55.803 --> 34:57.722
Tell me how you know
my dad was murdered.

34:57.930 --> 34:59.098
We have a witness.

35:00.308 --> 35:01.476
Who's they, Tatum?

35:03.644 --> 35:06.189
I was talking
about the voices in his head.

35:06.397 --> 35:07.899
He had hallucinations.

35:08.775 --> 35:11.110
- Who was it?
- A prison guard.

35:15.448 --> 35:16.616
You should go.

35:20.369 --> 35:22.455
If you think of anything
else you want to tell us,

35:23.164 --> 35:24.123
please call.

35:24.707 --> 35:27.960
Maybe we can meet somewhere
you're more comfortable?

35:30.713 --> 35:31.631
Yeah, okay.

35:40.807 --> 35:43.976
So, zombies work
for the police now.

36:04.413 --> 36:06.833
A bit much for Netflix
and chill, don't you think?

36:10.837 --> 36:12.088
We need to chat.

36:16.884 --> 36:18.302
I owe you an apology.

36:18.553 --> 36:19.887
For blowing my brains out?

36:20.138 --> 36:21.514
Hey, relationships are tough.

36:21.722 --> 36:23.182
You gotta do whatcha gotta do.

36:23.391 --> 36:25.560
- You were a Romero.
- No, I get it.

36:26.352 --> 36:28.312
Who'd wanna be seen
with an uggo like me, right?

36:30.273 --> 36:31.732
You know that's not it.

36:32.400 --> 36:34.360
I was so haunted
by the way that you died

36:34.569 --> 36:37.029
that I tried to push you out
of my mind completely.

36:38.114 --> 36:40.241
I've been diving into
all these different brains,

36:40.449 --> 36:44.120
at least in part,
so that I don't have to
live inside my own head.

36:46.414 --> 36:48.166
Face the grief of losing you.

36:50.168 --> 36:51.085
All right.

36:51.711 --> 36:52.879
I'm feeling a little better.

36:54.046 --> 36:55.464
Which means so am I.

37:02.722 --> 37:04.098
This is goodbye.

37:05.850 --> 37:07.018
Let's make it good.

37:23.576 --> 37:24.410
Liv...

37:27.205 --> 37:28.414
Look who
I ran into in the lobby.

37:32.126 --> 37:35.338
I'll, uh, let you two...

37:41.677 --> 37:42.929
That was just...

37:43.137 --> 37:44.555
Your ghost ex?

37:47.808 --> 37:49.060
Should I be jealous?

37:51.479 --> 37:52.688
Definitely not.

38:11.374 --> 38:13.834
Hey, is, uh, Peyton around?

38:15.628 --> 38:17.797
Kidding. Nice PJs.

38:19.590 --> 38:20.925
You wanna go kick some ass?

38:45.491 --> 38:47.868
Once they turn into one
of those monsters that
Harley showed us,

38:48.077 --> 38:49.912
is there any way
to change them back?

39:01.882 --> 39:03.592
Wakey. Wakey. You damn drunk.

39:05.386 --> 39:07.346
It's Bo John's time, Brother.

39:07.555 --> 39:08.306
Get your wicked stick.

39:08.514 --> 39:10.182
Let's give the
people what they want.

39:10.391 --> 39:13.144
Let's light up a zombie
and watch him go
cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs.

39:13.352 --> 39:15.730
Show America
they got a zombie problem!

39:15.938 --> 39:18.024
- Oh, yeah, baby!
- Yessiree!

39:18.232 --> 39:19.817
They're going
to torture him now?

39:26.866 --> 39:28.034
It's a gun range.

39:28.242 --> 39:30.036
These guys are gonna be
armed to the teeth.

39:30.244 --> 39:33.039
We need to have a plan.
What if we...

39:34.582 --> 39:36.292
You think you're
smoking in my car?

39:46.218 --> 39:48.637
Atta girl!

40:08.407 --> 40:10.242
Ninety-nine thousand
nine hundred and ninety-eight!

40:10.493 --> 40:12.745
Ninety-nine thousand
nine hundred and ninety-nine!

40:12.953 --> 40:14.246
One hundred thousand!

40:16.457 --> 40:18.084
It's a beautiful thing!

40:18.292 --> 40:20.419
You two, get over here.
You're a part of the team now.

40:24.632 --> 40:26.425
You guys sure about this?

40:26.634 --> 40:29.136
- You might kill him.
- Am I sure?

40:29.345 --> 40:30.846
Hell, yes, I'm sure.

40:31.055 --> 40:33.682
That thing you're
looking at is already dead.

40:33.891 --> 40:34.975
He's just
a brain-eating corpse

40:35.184 --> 40:36.519
like the ones
who ate my brother.

40:37.937 --> 40:39.271
Grab your shotguns, boys!

40:39.480 --> 40:41.899
Cover Bo!
If that thing gets loose...

40:42.441 --> 40:43.401
Blow its head off.

40:44.276 --> 40:45.611
They feel pain.

40:45.778 --> 40:47.321
He winces
when I give him injections.

40:47.488 --> 40:50.074
- You could
go too far, fry him.
- Oh...

40:50.282 --> 40:51.659
Bo knows cattle prods.

40:52.368 --> 40:53.536
Let's do this thing!

40:56.205 --> 40:59.083
Please.
Don't do this!

40:59.834 --> 41:01.460
I need more time to study him!

41:01.669 --> 41:03.421
Saving the human race,
that was the mission, right?

41:03.629 --> 41:04.755
That's what we're doing, Doc.

41:05.714 --> 41:07.425
We're showing
the world what
they have to be afraid of.

41:07.800 --> 41:11.345
You boys get the night off
from boning your cousins?

41:15.307 --> 41:19.061
You're gonna
get shot or shocked
standing there, Doc.

41:19.228 --> 41:20.438
On the count of five...

41:21.063 --> 41:22.314
This thing is on,

41:22.898 --> 41:26.735
and you standing there
don't mean a damn thing to us.

41:30.698 --> 41:31.991
He is a person.

41:32.575 --> 41:34.201
Zombie, yes.

41:34.410 --> 41:35.661
But a person.

41:37.371 --> 41:38.539
Five.

41:40.374 --> 41:42.084
- Four.
- No! Please, Ravi!

41:42.293 --> 41:44.879
- I'm gonna light you up!
- Move it, Shockterbooty!

41:45.087 --> 41:46.172
Three.

41:46.380 --> 41:47.548
- Now!
- Please move!

41:48.424 --> 41:50.009
- Do it!
- Don't do this!

41:51.343 --> 41:53.262
- Two.
- Listen! No!
