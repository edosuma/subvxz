WEBVTT

02:27.689 --> 02:30.101
Hey, he's right here.

03:35.257 --> 03:36.542
Woman: I've only read about it.

03:37.509 --> 03:38.919
I know it's extremely rare.

03:41.012 --> 03:42.627
So he can't feel

03:43.765 --> 03:44.765
or touch?

03:45.016 --> 03:48.008
No, he responds to normal touch
and pressure.

03:48.729 --> 03:51.311
His body just can't recognize
sensations of pain.

03:53.567 --> 03:55.933
Cipa is a very dangerous
condition.

03:56.570 --> 03:59.152
He could bite his own tongue off
and not even realize it.

04:00.073 --> 04:01.859
He could break a bone and keep
on playing.

04:02.159 --> 04:05.777
Even hot foods have to be
checked before he eats them.

04:06.079 --> 04:07.079
Of course.

04:18.216 --> 04:21.128
He has to be checked hourly for
cuts and bruises,

04:21.428 --> 04:24.386
and not just his arms and legs,
but his whole body,

04:24.681 --> 04:26.342
even inside his mouth.

04:27.184 --> 04:28.184
This is very important.

04:29.144 --> 04:31.180
Martin can't tell when something
hurts.

04:32.022 --> 04:33.022
Hi there.

04:34.232 --> 04:36.723
I bought this new bike for my
nephew's birthday,

04:37.360 --> 04:39.521
but he doesn't like the color.

04:39.821 --> 04:40.821
Can you believe that?

04:41.615 --> 04:43.276
I was gonna just throw it out

04:43.825 --> 04:44.985
when I saw you and I thought,

04:45.285 --> 04:47.446
"there's a kid who'd probably
love a new bike!"

04:48.288 --> 04:49.288
Am I right?

04:50.707 --> 04:53.449
It's right in my truck. Want to
take a look?

04:58.256 --> 04:59.917
Do you like red?

05:00.717 --> 05:03.504
It's difficult and exhausting.

05:03.970 --> 05:05.961
I've been through two aides
already.

05:06.973 --> 05:09.055
You don't have to worry, Mrs.
Bristol.

05:09.351 --> 05:11.342
Whatever you need, I'm here.

05:12.938 --> 05:14.849
Would you like to meet him now?

05:15.524 --> 05:18.436
Yes, please. - Okay.

05:26.368 --> 05:28.199
Mrs. Bristol: Oh my god.

05:29.120 --> 05:30.120
Martin!

05:32.541 --> 05:33.781
Martin!

07:06.718 --> 07:07.878
Don't be afraid.

07:09.262 --> 07:11.127
It doesn't have any feelings.

07:21.900 --> 07:24.186
It doesn't hurt, see?

07:47.342 --> 07:49.424
No!

07:57.686 --> 07:59.176
It'll be over soon.

09:49.923 --> 09:51.538
It's good to see you.

09:55.303 --> 09:57.339
How are you holding up?

09:57.639 --> 09:58.639
Okay.

10:00.809 --> 10:04.176
You know, you were here once
before.

10:04.979 --> 10:07.391
You were about that big.

10:08.399 --> 10:09.764
Remember?

10:10.068 --> 10:11.558
Not really.

10:14.656 --> 10:16.487
So that's everything?

10:16.783 --> 10:18.739
Yeah.

10:19.911 --> 10:21.572
Okay.

10:41.683 --> 10:44.550
“If I could see”

10:44.853 --> 10:46.263
“beyond this moment”

10:49.149 --> 10:51.265
“I'd hope to see you”

10:55.989 --> 10:57.900
“looking...”

11:00.910 --> 11:03.401
How long do I have to give up my
room?

11:03.830 --> 11:06.070
Well, just until your father
finishes remodeling the den.

11:07.458 --> 11:08.823
I'll be in college.

11:09.627 --> 11:11.083
They're herel

11:12.172 --> 11:14.413
now remember, calm and
compassionate.

11:15.592 --> 11:16.877
No, wen... Wendy.

11:23.641 --> 11:24.756
Hi.

11:25.059 --> 11:26.845
She's an only child.

11:27.854 --> 11:28.854
Hi! - Hi.

11:29.105 --> 11:30.436
Do you like mice? - No.

11:30.732 --> 11:32.268
How about snakes? - No.

11:32.859 --> 11:34.565
I can do a cartwheel. Want to
see?

11:35.612 --> 11:37.568
Oh, Allison, look at you.

11:38.698 --> 11:40.484
Oh. -

11:41.159 --> 11:42.569
mom, get out of the way!

11:42.869 --> 11:44.609
You didn't tell me how pretty
she is.

11:45.747 --> 11:47.203
My side of the family.

11:47.665 --> 11:49.496
You must be starving. - Not
really.

11:49.792 --> 11:50.792
Come on, Randy.

11:51.002 --> 11:53.084
This dog is always under my
feet.

11:53.838 --> 11:55.123
Come onin.

11:55.757 --> 11:58.590
Hey, dad, need some help? -
Yeah, I could use a hand.

11:59.385 --> 12:00.716
Mom, dad needs some help.

12:03.014 --> 12:06.097
Do you really get up at 4:00
every morning?

12:06.601 --> 12:08.341
When I'm in training, yeah.

12:08.770 --> 12:09.810
Can't you use a treadmill?

12:09.896 --> 12:11.496
Dad's got one. He hangs his
shirts on it.

12:11.814 --> 12:12.814
Wendy.

12:13.024 --> 12:14.264
Allison: I run distance.

12:17.320 --> 12:19.106
This is my room,

12:19.405 --> 12:21.066
or was my room.

12:21.366 --> 12:22.822
Now you'll be sleeping here
just...

12:23.117 --> 12:24.797
Until Jonathan finishes
remodeling the den.

12:24.911 --> 12:26.572
You didn't have to do that.

12:31.209 --> 12:32.729
Whiskers, how did you get out of
there?

12:33.044 --> 12:34.784
You naughty little boy.

12:35.088 --> 12:37.374
We'll be having supper in just a
few minutes.

12:38.132 --> 12:39.747
If you need anything, just give
a shout.

12:41.511 --> 12:43.752
This is your home too now.

12:53.564 --> 12:55.680
She's really taking it hard.

12:56.985 --> 12:59.021
Well, what do you expect?

13:00.238 --> 13:03.071
Her whole life's been turned
upside down overnight.

13:10.039 --> 13:11.519
Hey, Melissa, are you leaving
already?

13:11.833 --> 13:12.833
Yeah.

13:16.254 --> 13:17.915
Hey, can you cover my shift
tomorrow?

13:18.506 --> 13:19.506
I have exams.

13:19.924 --> 13:22.666
I know. I have to take Jesse to
the doctor again.

13:23.428 --> 13:24.428
How about Danielle?

13:24.971 --> 13:26.677
I asked her already.

13:28.808 --> 13:29.808
Yeah, okay.

13:30.685 --> 13:32.175
Thank you, sweetie. - No
problem.

14:14.896 --> 14:17.603
Hey, you're blocking my car.

15:36.060 --> 15:37.620
No. No, wait, please.

15:38.980 --> 15:40.811
No no, please.

15:41.107 --> 15:42.222
What are you doing?

15:42.608 --> 15:43.608
Are you crazy?

15:44.986 --> 15:46.647
No. Ow. Ow.

15:46.988 --> 15:49.195
Help!

15:49.866 --> 15:50.866
Ow. Ow.

15:55.037 --> 15:56.527
Please.

15:56.831 --> 15:57.866
Help!

16:07.258 --> 16:08.748
Door slams.

17:29.382 --> 17:30.382
Help.

17:30.841 --> 17:32.081
Woman: It's no use.

17:35.346 --> 17:36.802
Who's there?

17:41.018 --> 17:42.224
Hello?

17:42.520 --> 17:43.805
We're gonna die down here.

17:44.522 --> 17:45.522
No.

17:47.108 --> 17:49.724
No, we're gonna get out of here.

17:50.570 --> 17:51.730
What day is it?

18:45.416 --> 18:47.953
Curiosity killed the cat.

19:21.952 --> 19:23.032
Ow.

19:23.329 --> 19:25.445
Whoa.

19:26.040 --> 19:27.405
Are you all right? - I think so.

19:27.917 --> 19:29.717
They wouldn't brake for the pope
on this road.

19:30.127 --> 19:31.333
Yeah, I see that.

19:31.837 --> 19:33.168
Your... your arm is bleeding.

19:33.673 --> 19:35.233
You want to come inside? You can
wash up.

19:35.257 --> 19:36.292
It's nothing.

19:36.592 --> 19:37.592
Oh shit.

19:37.802 --> 19:40.589
- Are you sure you're all right?
- Yeah, it's just my leg.

19:41.055 --> 19:42.455
You want me to give you a ride
home?

19:42.765 --> 19:44.175
No, it's okay, really.

19:45.601 --> 19:48.058
It's not a big deal, just a
couple miles up the street.

19:48.354 --> 19:49.719
How do you know?

19:51.190 --> 19:52.190
Small town.

19:52.358 --> 19:53.689
Come on. What are neighbors for?

19:54.235 --> 19:57.068
A few miles? That's hardly
neighbors.

19:57.363 --> 19:59.775
Around here that's a next-door
neighbor.

20:01.075 --> 20:02.190
Okay, sure.

20:02.993 --> 20:05.154
All right, I'll be right back.

20:08.958 --> 20:10.573
Ow.

20:21.262 --> 20:23.548
Uh, I think I'm just gonna walk.

20:23.848 --> 20:25.088
Are you afraid?

20:25.391 --> 20:26.631
I'm not afraid.

20:26.934 --> 20:28.049
Great.

20:28.352 --> 20:29.512
Then get on.

20:35.693 --> 20:37.103
What's your name?

20:37.403 --> 20:39.394
Allison. - William.

20:39.697 --> 20:40.697
Slow down.

20:40.823 --> 20:43.280
I've never been on one of these
things before.

20:44.535 --> 20:46.695
After my accident the doctor
said I'd never ride again.

20:48.330 --> 20:49.866
I'm kidding.

20:51.584 --> 20:53.449
So where are you from?

20:53.836 --> 20:54.836
Chicago.

20:56.547 --> 20:57.957
I was there once.

20:58.257 --> 21:00.122
What brings you to this armpit?

21:01.010 --> 21:02.671
I came to live with my uncle.

21:04.430 --> 21:06.341
A problem with the parents?

21:07.308 --> 21:09.139
Family issues?

21:09.435 --> 21:11.141
Yeah.

21:11.437 --> 21:12.847
You too, huh?

21:13.647 --> 21:14.978
What kind of problems?

21:18.778 --> 21:20.234
They're dead.

21:21.572 --> 21:23.312
Shit, I'm sorry.

21:24.492 --> 21:26.403
Yeah.

21:26.702 --> 21:28.283
Me too.

21:43.636 --> 21:45.376
Thanks for the ride.

21:45.679 --> 21:47.294
Keep it.

21:48.766 --> 21:49.766
You need it.

22:07.326 --> 22:09.246
Man on radio: Still no leads in
the disappearance

22:09.537 --> 22:11.473
of college student Melissa
Barnes who was last seen

22:11.497 --> 22:13.863
leaving her place of employment
at the charcoal diner...

22:14.166 --> 22:15.702
Hey, how was your run?

22:16.502 --> 22:18.288
Interesting.

22:34.103 --> 22:36.685
Woman: Melissa, I... I think

22:36.981 --> 22:38.312
my hand is coming loose.

22:43.320 --> 22:45.902
He's coming. Don't make a sound.

22:46.657 --> 22:48.943
We're gonna get out of here.

22:57.918 --> 22:59.783
Man: When steer are led to
slaughter,

23:01.171 --> 23:03.878
they smell the stench of fear
and blood

23:05.050 --> 23:06.756
and they panic.

23:10.806 --> 23:14.390
Sometimes we'd have to saw off
their hind legs

23:14.685 --> 23:16.175
so they couldn't run.

23:23.861 --> 23:25.192
No.

23:25.487 --> 23:26.647
No, please.

23:29.366 --> 23:30.366
Woman: No.

23:31.827 --> 23:33.192
No. Oh god!

23:36.332 --> 23:38.664
Man: Hold her still.

23:41.337 --> 23:42.747
Man: Get back here.

24:00.481 --> 24:01.481
It's okay.

24:01.607 --> 24:02.687
Everything's under control.

24:04.109 --> 24:06.896
Looks like I got here just in
time.

24:19.500 --> 24:21.957
When something outlasts its
usefulness,

24:22.252 --> 24:24.083
it gets discarded.

25:18.058 --> 25:20.299
Still here?

25:35.784 --> 25:38.070
See you later. - Yeah.

25:38.370 --> 25:39.780
Bye. - Bye.

25:41.623 --> 25:43.113
Are you sure you're all right?

25:43.542 --> 25:45.302
Yeah, gotta get it over with
sooner or later.

25:46.462 --> 25:47.998
She'll be fine.

25:58.974 --> 26:00.930
Nervous?

26:01.226 --> 26:03.342
You think they'll have a decent
track team?

26:04.438 --> 26:06.099
Don't get your hopes up.

26:07.066 --> 26:09.022
No chance of that.

26:17.826 --> 26:20.158
What is that place?

26:20.454 --> 26:23.036
That's the sutter plant. It's
been closed for years.

26:23.582 --> 26:25.664
I saw someone there yesterday
while I was jogging...

26:26.251 --> 26:27.251
A boy.

26:28.212 --> 26:29.212
A boy?

26:29.546 --> 26:30.706
Yeah, I thought so.

26:31.173 --> 26:33.334
Probably just some kids
vandalizing the place.

26:33.884 --> 26:35.484
I kind of wish you'd stay away
from there

26:35.719 --> 26:37.050
and jog on the main road.

26:38.347 --> 26:39.757
Yeah, and get hit by a truck.

26:40.224 --> 26:43.011
Graham's a pack rat. That place
should be condemned.

26:43.310 --> 26:44.925
Someone lives there?

26:45.312 --> 26:47.143
Yeah, he stays mostly to
himself.

26:47.439 --> 26:48.439
You know him?

26:49.775 --> 26:51.015
We're about the same age.

26:51.652 --> 26:52.983
He never went to school.

26:54.988 --> 26:57.195
His dad made him work at that
place day and night.

26:58.158 --> 27:00.444
It was a meat-packing plant

27:02.121 --> 27:05.488
till they couldn't afford to
upgrade the equipment to code.

27:06.583 --> 27:08.949
I'll tell you one thing: I don't
miss the smell.

27:23.350 --> 27:25.591
I'll pick you up at 2:30.

27:59.428 --> 28:02.295
Silence is a sound

28:02.931 --> 28:05.468
of no fear...

28:08.395 --> 28:10.181
No pain...

28:13.567 --> 28:15.558
The sound of peace.

28:40.260 --> 28:43.673
I envy your Serenity.

28:50.270 --> 28:51.885
The path to redemption

28:53.065 --> 28:54.521
begins with forgiveness...

28:56.193 --> 28:57.854
Absolution.

29:00.739 --> 29:02.695
You're my witness.

29:37.484 --> 29:39.315
What did I tell you?

29:39.736 --> 29:41.101
I told you don't touch, didn't
I?

29:43.991 --> 29:46.107
William: Yeah, the bolts are
stripped.

29:47.286 --> 29:48.651
Cashier: $17.50.

29:49.663 --> 29:53.497
Can I owe you the 50 cents? -
Yeah, right.

29:54.376 --> 29:55.411
William: Thanks, Eddie.

30:05.595 --> 30:07.631
Jonathan, how's that extension
coming?

30:07.973 --> 30:08.973
It's going really good.

30:11.601 --> 30:13.557
You know you've got drywall
nails here?

30:13.979 --> 30:14.979
Hmm?

30:15.564 --> 30:16.564
Oh shit.

30:18.191 --> 30:20.352
Just cheerleading. Unless you
can kick a field goal.

30:20.652 --> 30:21.652
That's it?

30:21.862 --> 30:24.222
There isn't much of a demand for
girls' sports in this area.

30:25.240 --> 30:27.151
Our cheerleading squad did win
best routine

30:27.492 --> 30:29.483
in the state final last year.

30:36.877 --> 30:38.617
Come on! Whoo-hoo!

30:39.796 --> 30:41.457
Yeah!

30:42.215 --> 30:43.705
Girl: Ready?

30:44.301 --> 30:46.917
Let's shake it. Let's shout it.

30:47.220 --> 30:48.710
Phs!

30:49.014 --> 30:51.721
Let's shake it. Let's shout it.

30:52.017 --> 30:53.973
Phs!

30:54.269 --> 30:56.806
Let's shake it. Let's shout it.

32:04.631 --> 32:07.543
Aren't you scared of that
falling and crushing you?

32:14.850 --> 32:16.715
How's your leg?

32:17.018 --> 32:19.509
Oh, it's better.

32:21.648 --> 32:24.731
So this is what you do...

32:25.735 --> 32:26.850
Fix cars?

32:27.154 --> 32:29.816
Guidance counselor told me my
aptitude tests said

32:30.115 --> 32:32.822
either medical school or auto
mechanic.

32:33.118 --> 32:36.155
I can't stand the sight of
blood, so...

32:38.999 --> 32:42.241
Okay, well, I don't want to
bother you, so...

32:46.131 --> 32:47.837
Hey.

32:48.133 --> 32:50.169
Yeah?

32:51.803 --> 32:53.134
Are you busy later?

32:53.763 --> 32:55.643
Um, I was gonna go home and
stare at the ceiling

32:56.808 --> 32:58.423
until I fell asleep. Why?

32:58.727 --> 33:00.092
Well, I was...

33:01.480 --> 33:03.721
I was wondering if maybe you
wanted to...

33:04.024 --> 33:05.855
Man: Billy!

33:06.151 --> 33:07.607
Excuse me.

33:09.821 --> 33:11.527
Billy! - Dad?

33:12.324 --> 33:14.155
In here.

33:15.035 --> 33:16.195
Christ. - God.

33:17.537 --> 33:19.994
I dropped the fucking remote.

33:20.290 --> 33:21.325
Be careful.

33:22.209 --> 33:23.870
Ow, Jesus! - Sorry, dad.

33:24.169 --> 33:25.659
Oh man. - You're dead weight.

33:25.962 --> 33:27.122
Yeah, well, I'm not dead yet.

33:28.840 --> 33:30.626
Oh.- can I help?

33:30.926 --> 33:33.154
Father: Just... just lift me
up. - Yeah, just hold his chair.

33:33.178 --> 33:35.339
Okay. - Come on, just put me
back on my chair.

33:35.639 --> 33:36.639
You got it.

33:36.723 --> 33:38.805
Allison: Here. -

33:41.686 --> 33:43.597
Allison: Okay. - You could
have hurt yourself.

33:44.064 --> 33:45.850
What do you mean, could have?

33:48.026 --> 33:49.311
Thank you. - Yeah.

33:51.821 --> 33:53.482
Um, dad, this is Allison.

33:54.074 --> 33:56.486
Allison, this is my dad.

33:56.785 --> 33:58.185
Allison: Hi. - She's from
Chicago.

33:58.286 --> 33:59.286
Really? - Mm-hmm.

33:59.496 --> 34:00.576
From Chicago? - Yeah.

34:00.997 --> 34:02.953
I hate Chicago.

34:05.293 --> 34:07.534
Hey, at least you're not gay,
right? - Dad.

34:07.837 --> 34:10.873
You know, he spends most of the
time alone in his room,

34:12.092 --> 34:15.255
doing who knows what. - Yeah,
you should talk.

34:15.554 --> 34:17.514
Yeah, but it's about the only
thing I've got left.

34:17.597 --> 34:19.553
Um, I should probably go.

34:20.058 --> 34:21.058
William: No, stay.

34:21.560 --> 34:23.161
No, it's getting late. I really
have to get home.

34:23.186 --> 34:24.801
William: He's not normally like
this.

34:25.105 --> 34:26.105
He's usually much worse.

34:26.940 --> 34:29.226
Well, maybe you should give him
the helmet.

34:29.943 --> 34:30.978
Bye.

34:35.239 --> 34:36.696
What the hell is the matter with
you?

34:36.992 --> 34:38.527
Can't she take a joke?

34:38.994 --> 34:39.994
Hey, come on.

34:40.245 --> 34:41.985
Hey, toss me my cigarettes.

34:46.126 --> 34:48.538
Hey, what...? Now what am I
supposed to do?

35:47.354 --> 35:48.594
What's your name?

35:51.941 --> 35:53.477
Hello?

35:54.361 --> 35:56.101
Can you answer me, please?

35:57.697 --> 35:59.653
Graham: If they have no
feelings,

36:01.201 --> 36:03.908
they can't know fear.

36:10.001 --> 36:12.117
But if they can't know fear...

36:13.797 --> 36:15.503
Why do they run?

36:16.716 --> 36:18.001
Let me go.

36:19.469 --> 36:21.881
All clean?

36:22.972 --> 36:26.009
Come here.

36:43.243 --> 36:45.484
What are you doing?

36:51.251 --> 36:52.661
Give me your arm.

36:55.004 --> 36:56.585
Don't.

36:57.424 --> 36:58.630
Run!

36:58.925 --> 37:02.088
He doesn't understand. Can't you
see?

37:02.429 --> 37:04.545
Stop it. Stop it!

37:08.268 --> 37:09.849
His conscience is unburdened.

37:10.145 --> 37:11.476
You're crazy!

37:12.147 --> 37:13.147
Is yours?

37:13.314 --> 37:15.771
Let me go! You're fucking crazy!

37:16.317 --> 37:17.932
Let me go!

37:22.949 --> 37:24.155
Oh god.

37:37.297 --> 37:38.297
Where were you?

37:39.382 --> 37:40.382
Um, I'm sorry.

37:41.009 --> 37:42.249
You're sorry?

37:42.552 --> 37:43.552
Jonathan.

37:44.429 --> 37:45.885
I thought we said 2:30.

37:46.264 --> 37:47.264
I left early.

37:47.640 --> 37:48.800
We were beginning to worry.

37:50.143 --> 37:51.974
Well, I said I'm sorry.

37:52.687 --> 37:54.223
Let's not make it a habit.

37:55.940 --> 37:56.940
Okay? - Okay.

37:58.276 --> 38:00.107
You've been to Paris?

38:00.779 --> 38:01.814
Yeah, a few times.

38:02.113 --> 38:03.673
Wow, you've been to so many cool
places.

38:04.407 --> 38:07.399
Yeah, my dad used to turn all of
his business trips

38:07.786 --> 38:09.151
into family vacations.

38:10.205 --> 38:11.866
He was great like that.

38:13.333 --> 38:15.039
I've never been anywhere.

38:15.335 --> 38:17.701
Well, maybe someday you can go
to Chicago with me.

38:18.004 --> 38:20.370
Tomorrow? - No.

38:23.885 --> 38:25.591
Hi guys. Wendy.

38:26.262 --> 38:28.344
Can I borrow your camera?

38:28.807 --> 38:30.343
Yeah, there's a few more
pictures left.

38:30.642 --> 38:32.178
You can finish the roll if you
want.

38:32.477 --> 38:34.718
Dad, can we go to France?

38:35.021 --> 38:37.012
Sure. I'll cash in some stock
options.

38:37.315 --> 38:38.395
See what I mean?

38:38.858 --> 38:40.098
How about Pittsburgh, huh?

38:42.362 --> 38:44.444
Wendy: How much longer do I have
to give up my room?

38:44.781 --> 38:46.021
Jonathan: Not much longer.

38:46.658 --> 38:48.698
Wendy: Don't you think whiskers
needs a bigger cage?

38:48.827 --> 38:51.068
Jonathan: I think that cage is
just fine.

38:51.913 --> 38:54.199
Do you think Allison's happy
here?

38:54.958 --> 38:55.958
I hope so.

38:57.001 --> 38:59.367
I don't think she likes me.

38:59.671 --> 39:02.333
How could somebody not like you?

39:02.632 --> 39:04.668
- I know, right?
- Right.

39:05.927 --> 39:07.633
You know, I'm... I... I...

39:08.972 --> 39:10.587
I'm feeling... feeling something.

39:10.890 --> 39:13.632
I'm feeling a little... I'm
feeling a little hungry.

39:13.935 --> 39:14.935
Oh no.

39:15.228 --> 39:17.188
I need a pillow sandwich. -

39:36.749 --> 39:37.955
Hello.

39:38.877 --> 39:40.458
Can you talk?

39:41.421 --> 39:42.706
I can help you.

39:43.715 --> 39:47.833
You've just got to help me get
loose first.

39:55.894 --> 39:57.304
Please.

39:57.937 --> 39:59.552
Help me.

40:33.097 --> 40:35.839
I've done everything you've
asked me.

40:42.899 --> 40:45.140
You could make it stop.

41:19.686 --> 41:21.472
God damn it!

43:56.676 --> 43:58.792
Now they can't trust you.

44:00.513 --> 44:03.425
You're gonna have to make it up
to them somehow.

44:05.017 --> 44:08.009
They take advantage

44:08.729 --> 44:10.560
of vulnerability and weakness.

44:11.149 --> 44:12.355
Bury it.

44:20.700 --> 44:23.362
The furnace needs scrubbing.

44:44.515 --> 44:46.631
Graham: You caused all this.

45:38.361 --> 45:39.441
Be good, sweetie.

45:39.904 --> 45:40.984
I will.

45:47.954 --> 45:48.954
Whiskers, no.

45:51.290 --> 45:53.326
Theories on our emotional
development

45:53.709 --> 45:55.791
are divided into two schools of
thought...

45:56.295 --> 45:58.456
Whether we're products of
genetics

45:58.798 --> 46:01.460
predisposed to exhibit certain
behavioral patterns,

46:01.801 --> 46:03.587
or products of our environment.

46:03.886 --> 46:05.342
Evolutionary biologists believe

46:05.888 --> 46:07.003
that our inherited genes

46:07.640 --> 46:09.050
are what determine development.

46:10.643 --> 46:12.123
Opponents argue that our
individuality

46:12.561 --> 46:16.053
is directly influenced by the
patterns of behavior

46:16.399 --> 46:18.515
that we see and hear every day.

46:18.818 --> 46:20.433
In other words,

46:20.987 --> 46:23.023
a child raised in a loving
environment

46:23.322 --> 46:26.155
will respond to the world in a
much different way

46:26.492 --> 46:29.359
than a child raised in fear or
taught to hate.

46:29.787 --> 46:33.029
Our children are in essence
mirror images of ourselves...

46:33.416 --> 46:35.532
Our beliefs, our ideologies,

46:35.835 --> 46:37.666
our conscience...

46:38.713 --> 46:41.204
Ground control to major Tom...

46:41.882 --> 46:43.418
Which brings us to
psychotherapy...

46:43.759 --> 46:46.421
The psychoanalytic theory of
personality.

46:46.762 --> 46:48.673
This will be on the test,
people.

47:30.639 --> 47:32.345
Hey, need a ride?

47:32.641 --> 47:33.881
Uh, I don't know.

47:34.185 --> 47:35.185
Come on, get in.

47:36.062 --> 47:38.428
Take a break. Have some fun.

47:42.443 --> 47:44.399
Are you starting your own
pharmacy?

47:44.695 --> 47:45.730
I get headaches.

47:46.781 --> 47:47.896
I can't stay out late.

47:48.407 --> 47:50.047
Don't worry. I'll have you back
by Monday.

47:51.035 --> 47:52.525
Yeah, I restored it piece by
piece.

47:52.912 --> 47:55.699
I thought about opening my own
body shop one day, but...

47:55.998 --> 47:57.784
Why don't you?

47:58.084 --> 48:01.622
Um, well, my dad... he's not so
good on his own.

48:03.047 --> 48:04.662
So how far do you run anyway?

48:06.175 --> 48:07.506
Five, six miles.

48:08.803 --> 48:10.509
I would have a heart attack.

48:10.888 --> 48:11.297
Yeah.

48:11.680 --> 48:13.887
These will give you a heart
attack.

48:16.310 --> 48:18.471
I guess you never eat junk like
this, huh?

48:18.938 --> 48:20.769
I'm not in training right now.

48:21.190 --> 48:23.055
Yeah, me neither.

48:41.877 --> 48:44.493
So do you have any brothers or
sisters?

48:44.964 --> 48:46.579
Just me and my dad.

48:46.882 --> 48:49.715
My mom died a couple of years
ago...

48:50.010 --> 48:51.010
Pneumonia.

48:52.346 --> 48:54.678
Has he always been, um...?

48:54.974 --> 48:57.056
Yeah, he used to work
construction.

48:57.351 --> 48:59.342
He lost the use of his legs in
an accident

48:59.937 --> 49:02.553
in Chicago, actually.

49:05.860 --> 49:08.522
My father always wanted a boy.

49:11.407 --> 49:13.272
He was a track star

49:14.702 --> 49:17.739
and just missed qualifying for
the Olympics in '76.

49:19.623 --> 49:22.456
He tried to correct that failure
through me.

49:26.130 --> 49:28.086
They were driving home from
dinner

49:28.382 --> 49:30.543
just a mile from the house
and...

49:34.555 --> 49:37.217
An SUV blew a stop sign.

49:39.810 --> 49:41.516
It's funny

49:42.271 --> 49:45.308
how everything can change in an
instant.

49:45.608 --> 49:47.439
A stranger can come along

49:48.027 --> 49:49.983
and in the blink of an eye just

49:51.947 --> 49:53.403
destroy everything.

49:55.659 --> 49:57.524
So you came to live with your
uncle?

50:00.331 --> 50:04.324
I have a grandmother who lives in New York,

50:04.793 --> 50:07.580
but she's agoraphobic,

50:08.214 --> 50:11.001
a real freak show, so...

50:11.300 --> 50:13.211
It was her or my uncle.

50:14.678 --> 50:16.714
I bet you wish you went to new
York now, huh?

50:19.225 --> 50:21.967
I hate New York.

51:21.620 --> 51:22.951
Out of the car, Allison.

51:23.247 --> 51:24.453
What? - You heard me.

51:24.957 --> 51:28.165
I'm not going anywhere. -
Yeah, back off, man.

51:28.544 --> 51:29.704
You shut your mouth! Come on.

51:30.129 --> 51:32.711
What are you doing? - I'm
taking you home.

51:34.300 --> 51:35.335
Allison.

51:37.720 --> 51:41.178
Your mother and father worked
hard so you could be somebody.

51:41.473 --> 51:43.754
I'm not gonna let you derail
that by hanging out with that

51:44.226 --> 51:46.137
trailer trash. You don't even
know him.

51:46.437 --> 51:48.644
I know that kid better than you
ever will.

51:48.939 --> 51:50.019
If your father was here...

51:50.482 --> 51:52.222
Look, sports, college... that
whole thing...

51:52.651 --> 51:54.266
That was my father's dream, not
mine.

51:54.695 --> 51:56.026
I never wanted any of it.

51:56.322 --> 51:58.633
Well, what do you want? Do you
want to live in the back of a...

51:58.657 --> 52:00.137
Truck? Do you want to collect
welfare?

52:00.534 --> 52:02.525
You think I wanted to come here?

52:02.870 --> 52:05.282
You think I wanted to come and
live with you?

52:12.671 --> 52:14.707
My brother and I made a promise

52:15.090 --> 52:16.090
a long time ago:

52:16.634 --> 52:19.592
Should something happen to
either of us,

52:20.471 --> 52:22.962
we'd be there for each other's
kids.

52:25.142 --> 52:28.976
It's not one you ever expect to
have to keep,

52:29.271 --> 52:32.013
and I'm not going back on my
word,

52:33.150 --> 52:34.856
but it's your life.

52:35.986 --> 52:37.772
You want to try it out on your
own,

52:38.364 --> 52:40.150
go ahead.

52:43.702 --> 52:45.567
You want me to get out?

52:45.871 --> 52:48.237
I want you to make a choice.

52:54.171 --> 52:57.038
Okay, well, we'll do things my
way for a while,

52:57.341 --> 53:00.048
just as long as we understand
each other.

53:55.274 --> 53:57.310
Woman: Oh no.

53:57.609 --> 53:59.224
No.

54:02.781 --> 54:05.648
I haven't done anything. I
haven't done anything.

54:06.410 --> 54:07.410
Please.

54:09.288 --> 54:10.494
Graham: Like I showed you.

54:10.789 --> 54:12.620
Woman: Why are you doing this?

54:14.376 --> 54:17.038
How frightening when it's our
own flesh.

54:17.337 --> 54:18.337
Woman: No!

54:19.339 --> 54:20.339
No, stop.

54:20.924 --> 54:22.209
Graham: Hold her still.

54:22.801 --> 54:24.462
Woman: No.

54:24.845 --> 54:26.301
Graham: Do it! - Please, please.

54:27.222 --> 54:29.178
I don't think your heart's in
this. - No. No.

54:57.169 --> 54:59.706
Come on. Come on.

55:00.798 --> 55:02.504
I'm not afraid of you anymore.

55:03.133 --> 55:04.669
This is my house.

55:04.968 --> 55:07.550
I'm not gonna be like you...
Condemned.

55:08.138 --> 55:09.674
I'm fixing what you broke!

55:10.766 --> 55:13.428
Go back to hell where your bed
is made.

55:14.144 --> 55:16.100
This is my house!

56:07.948 --> 56:10.405
My dad trusted me. - Jonathan
will too.

56:10.701 --> 56:12.612
You just have to give him a
chance.

56:12.911 --> 56:14.993
Besides, it's not you he doesn't
trust.

56:15.289 --> 56:16.779
I can take care of myself.

56:17.207 --> 56:18.822
I know you can.

56:19.209 --> 56:20.870
He's just trying to look out for
you.

56:21.461 --> 56:22.951
Please.

56:28.510 --> 56:31.126
What's he got against William
anyway?

56:31.430 --> 56:34.217
Oh, we've known Billy since he
was this high.

56:35.017 --> 56:38.259
He's had to deal with more than
his share of problems.

56:38.729 --> 56:39.729
That's not his fault.

56:39.855 --> 56:43.188
I mean, I think it's wonderful
how he takes care of his father,

56:43.692 --> 56:46.104
especially after what happened
to his mother.

56:46.570 --> 56:49.277
Well, she did that to herself.

56:50.490 --> 56:52.776
You can't give yourself
pneumonia.

56:54.661 --> 56:56.401
She didn't die of pneumonia.

56:57.039 --> 57:00.782
Billy's mother... she killed
herself.

57:01.960 --> 57:03.666
What?

57:04.338 --> 57:07.546
Hung herself in the garage.

57:12.387 --> 57:14.298
Billy was the one who found her.

57:16.016 --> 57:17.597
It was really hard on him.

57:18.602 --> 57:21.309
The doctors put him on all sorts
of medication.

57:21.605 --> 57:24.312
He's gotten in a lot of trouble
around town.

57:24.608 --> 57:27.270
I think Jonathan's just afraid
he's a little unstable.

57:27.569 --> 57:29.309
And his father... well...

57:30.113 --> 57:31.353
Where are you going?

57:31.907 --> 57:33.693
I need to sort things out in my
head.

57:36.370 --> 57:38.156
Hey, Allison, you want to play a
game?

57:38.789 --> 57:39.995
Maybe later, okay?

57:40.707 --> 57:41.913
Where are you going?

58:03.605 --> 58:05.015
Hi.

58:07.025 --> 58:08.856
Hi.

58:09.861 --> 58:11.146
Can I talk to you?

58:14.992 --> 58:17.153
There's nothing to talk about.

58:22.541 --> 58:25.374
I came to apologize for last
night.

58:25.669 --> 58:27.330
Not your fault.

58:28.130 --> 58:29.461
He's probably right.

58:29.965 --> 58:31.751
Whatever happened in the past
doesn't matter.

58:32.551 --> 58:34.587
Nothing happened.

58:35.303 --> 58:37.760
Let's start with no more lies,
okay?

58:38.557 --> 58:40.218
What are you talking about?

58:40.517 --> 58:42.303
I know.

58:42.602 --> 58:44.388
About your mother.

58:45.230 --> 58:46.230
You do, huh?

58:47.232 --> 58:48.893
And those pills aren't for
headaches.

58:49.192 --> 58:49.681
What do you know?

58:49.985 --> 58:52.226
I know how hard it is to lose
someone.

58:52.696 --> 58:55.216
I know that your mother wouldn't
want you to feel responsible for

58:55.240 --> 58:55.774
her death.

58:56.116 --> 58:56.445
Hey!

58:56.742 --> 58:58.824
What the hell are you talking
shit to my son for?

58:59.244 --> 58:59.733
Dad.

59:00.120 --> 59:01.389
Who the hell do you think you
are?

59:01.413 --> 59:02.027
Dad, shut up.

59:02.372 --> 59:04.738
You're talking about his mother,
that bitch?

59:05.042 --> 59:05.406
Don't.

59:05.709 --> 59:06.869
All she did was abandon us.

59:07.294 --> 59:08.909
She never gave a shit about you.

59:09.254 --> 59:10.254
Not now.

59:10.297 --> 59:13.334
This is my house, I'll say
whatever the hell I want.

59:13.675 --> 59:14.334
Dad.

59:14.634 --> 59:17.592
What, I'm supposed to hold my
tongue so some piece of ass

59:17.971 --> 59:19.336
won't get offended?

59:19.765 --> 59:21.847
Why do you always gotta be such
an asshole?

59:24.895 --> 59:28.729
They always leave, just when you
need them the most.

59:31.610 --> 59:33.020
Allison!

59:39.743 --> 59:40.743
Why, dad?

59:40.952 --> 59:43.659
Does it make you feel better to
humiliate me like that?

59:44.122 --> 59:45.122
Good riddance.

59:45.499 --> 59:48.332
One of these days, you're gonna
push me too far and then where

59:48.627 --> 59:49.036
will you be?

59:49.419 --> 59:51.956
Who will take care of you when
I'm gone?

59:52.255 --> 59:53.255
You wanna go?

59:54.382 --> 59:55.417
Then go!

59:55.717 --> 59:58.550
Get lost! Get out of here!

01:00:23.662 --> 01:00:26.199
Hello?

01:00:29.251 --> 01:00:31.412
No, wait.

01:01:51.750 --> 01:01:53.456
Hello?

01:02:11.895 --> 01:02:15.763
Hey, are you okay?

01:02:16.066 --> 01:02:17.772
Wait.

01:02:45.428 --> 01:02:47.635
Are you okay?

01:02:47.931 --> 01:02:49.842
Are you in trouble?

01:03:07.826 --> 01:03:10.192
What are you doing down here?

01:03:18.128 --> 01:03:20.665
Are you in here?

01:03:43.028 --> 01:03:44.893
Oh my god.

01:04:31.576 --> 01:04:33.988
Martin.

01:05:10.615 --> 01:05:11.775
Hello?

01:05:14.577 --> 01:05:17.159
Are you down here?

01:05:50.822 --> 01:05:51.937
Where are you?

01:05:57.120 --> 01:05:58.280
Wait. Come back.

01:06:12.844 --> 01:06:13.884
I'm not going to hurt you.

01:06:14.971 --> 01:06:17.212
I want to help you.

01:06:18.224 --> 01:06:21.136
Is your name Martin?

01:06:21.728 --> 01:06:23.889
Here, come with me.

01:06:24.564 --> 01:06:26.805
You can't stay here. It's not
safe.

01:06:28.026 --> 01:06:29.141
What's wrong?

01:06:30.153 --> 01:06:32.269
You don't have to be afraid.

01:06:32.989 --> 01:06:34.604
You can trust me.

01:06:35.658 --> 01:06:36.864
You shouldn't be down here.

01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:38.696
No! No!

01:06:38.995 --> 01:06:39.995
No! No! No!

01:06:54.052 --> 01:06:55.917
Good work.

01:07:04.646 --> 01:07:06.261
I'm sure she's fine. - How?

01:07:06.564 --> 01:07:07.750
She's just blowing off some
steam.

01:07:07.774 --> 01:07:11.016
No 17-year-old wants to be told
what to do.

01:07:16.449 --> 01:07:17.814
Not yet.

01:07:18.159 --> 01:07:21.151
I don't have any brothers or
sisters 'cause dad's lazy.

01:07:21.454 --> 01:07:23.285
And now he's chased her away
too.

01:07:23.957 --> 01:07:25.538
Way to go, dad.

01:08:22.724 --> 01:08:24.589
She never came home last night.

01:08:25.059 --> 01:08:26.059
I know.

01:08:27.312 --> 01:08:28.676
Where are you going?

01:08:29.229 --> 01:08:30.515
I'm gonna go find her.

01:08:36.154 --> 01:08:37.689
I need to speak to Allison.

01:08:38.363 --> 01:08:39.604
She's not here.

01:08:40.366 --> 01:08:41.697
It's important.

01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:44.319
She isn't here, Billy. - We
thought she was with you.

01:08:45.121 --> 01:08:47.157
No. Well she was, but-

01:08:47.497 --> 01:08:48.497
what happened?

01:08:49.167 --> 01:08:50.167
We had a fight.

01:08:51.169 --> 01:08:52.169
Oh Jesus.

01:08:52.252 --> 01:08:53.252
I thought she went home.

01:08:53.379 --> 01:08:53.868
Oh, god.

01:08:54.212 --> 01:08:55.252
She's been gone all night?

01:08:55.590 --> 01:08:56.590
Since yesterday.

01:08:56.758 --> 01:08:58.167
This is your goddamn fault.

01:08:58.551 --> 01:09:00.667
Stop. Jonathan. - Stay the
hell away from her.

01:09:01.179 --> 01:09:02.299
Jonathan. - Don't push me.

01:09:03.096 --> 01:09:04.506
Jonathan. - You're no good.

01:09:06.475 --> 01:09:07.807
Good for nothing.

01:09:08.185 --> 01:09:10.017
It's okay.

01:09:11.564 --> 01:09:13.350
Stay away from my niece!

01:10:40.445 --> 01:10:42.026
Please.

01:10:43.698 --> 01:10:45.654
If they have no feelings,

01:10:46.284 --> 01:10:48.366
they can't know fear.

01:10:51.205 --> 01:10:54.117
But if they can't know fear...

01:10:57.003 --> 01:10:59.244
Then why do they run?

01:11:12.310 --> 01:11:15.973
Anybody home?

01:11:19.609 --> 01:11:21.224
Please don't.

01:11:27.533 --> 01:11:28.693
Sutter!

01:11:29.911 --> 01:11:30.946
Uncle Jay!

01:11:57.355 --> 01:11:59.266
Hello?

01:12:09.283 --> 01:12:10.739
Who's there?

01:12:12.161 --> 01:12:14.026
It's Jonathan Miller.

01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:15.911
I'm looking for my niece.

01:12:16.374 --> 01:12:18.490
She didn't come home last night.

01:12:19.126 --> 01:12:21.117
I've been looking all over for
her.

01:12:21.420 --> 01:12:23.190
I thought she might have
wandered over here. Have you

01:12:23.214 --> 01:12:24.294
seen her? No.

01:12:27.176 --> 01:12:30.714
Listen, do you have a young boy
living over here?

01:12:32.181 --> 01:12:34.763
She said she saw a boy running
around over here.

01:12:35.393 --> 01:12:36.974
Just get off my property.

01:12:38.688 --> 01:12:40.519
You mind if I come in a moment?

01:12:41.065 --> 01:12:42.065
I'm busy.

01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:43.400
Just a moment.

01:12:44.819 --> 01:12:46.525
Just a second.

01:12:49.198 --> 01:12:50.779
Uncle Jay!

01:12:51.659 --> 01:12:52.659
Allison?

01:13:15.808 --> 01:13:17.890
Uncle Jay!

01:13:23.524 --> 01:13:25.264
What did you do?

01:13:25.568 --> 01:13:26.728
You girls, you...

01:13:27.987 --> 01:13:29.602
You never can keep your mouths
shut.

01:13:31.866 --> 01:13:33.356
No! No!

01:13:35.369 --> 01:13:36.779
No. No.

01:13:42.251 --> 01:13:43.457
No. No.

01:13:49.550 --> 01:13:50.756
No!

01:13:52.094 --> 01:13:53.300
No.

01:13:55.890 --> 01:13:58.848
Leave me alone!

01:15:15.553 --> 01:15:19.512
Screaming

01:15:28.858 --> 01:15:30.598
William: Hello?

01:15:33.571 --> 01:15:35.152
Allison?

01:15:36.741 --> 01:15:38.447
Mr. Miller?

01:16:07.104 --> 01:16:09.095
William: Hello?

01:16:55.569 --> 01:16:57.434
Oh my god! Martin!

01:16:59.782 --> 01:17:00.942
Help Mel

01:17:02.952 --> 01:17:04.317
open the door!

01:17:07.748 --> 01:17:09.989
Come back! Help!

01:17:12.461 --> 01:17:14.827
Let me out, Martin!

01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:17.171
Allison?

01:17:24.765 --> 01:17:26.221
Hello?

01:17:48.706 --> 01:17:50.412
Allison!

01:17:52.585 --> 01:17:53.620
Allison!

01:17:55.212 --> 01:17:56.212
I can't hear you!

01:17:56.255 --> 01:17:58.746
William! Open the door!

01:17:59.049 --> 01:18:00.129
It's locked!

01:18:00.718 --> 01:18:02.254
Hurry!

01:18:14.648 --> 01:18:16.730
Turn around, please!

01:18:18.152 --> 01:18:19.892
Turn around!

01:18:20.279 --> 01:18:22.315
I'm gonna get you out of here I
promise, its okay!

01:18:22.948 --> 01:18:24.028
I got it!

01:18:25.075 --> 01:18:26.360
Turn around!

01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:48.295
No!

01:19:37.940 --> 01:19:39.726
Forgetit.

01:19:43.821 --> 01:19:45.732
Leave me alone!

01:19:58.043 --> 01:19:59.658
I don't care!

01:20:00.337 --> 01:20:01.702
Let them find out.

01:20:30.743 --> 01:20:33.951
I won'tdo it. I can't.

01:20:39.877 --> 01:20:41.708
You leave him alone.

01:20:42.004 --> 01:20:43.494
He hasn't done anything!

01:20:46.175 --> 01:20:48.587
No! No I need him!

01:20:49.345 --> 01:20:51.631
Who's gonna help me clean up?

01:20:53.432 --> 01:20:55.798
You know I can't stand it.

01:20:56.435 --> 01:20:58.642
No! Shut up!

01:20:59.480 --> 01:21:01.141
Shut up!

01:21:03.859 --> 01:21:06.066
You're no better than he was!

01:21:40.521 --> 01:21:41.681
You promised me!

01:21:41.980 --> 01:21:44.016
I did everything you said!

01:22:06.088 --> 01:22:07.874
You win.

01:22:20.769 --> 01:22:24.887
You're wrong. He wouldn't dare.

01:22:55.637 --> 01:22:57.753
Don't look at me like that.

01:22:58.474 --> 01:23:00.465
You don't ask why.

01:23:01.351 --> 01:23:02.351
You just do.

01:23:03.228 --> 01:23:04.718
That's just the way it is.

01:23:09.359 --> 01:23:10.769
Do you think you owe me?

01:23:12.196 --> 01:23:14.938
That maybe I should grow eyes in
the back of my head?

01:23:16.033 --> 01:23:18.365
They abandoned you.

01:23:19.620 --> 01:23:22.987
What would you be without me?

01:23:24.917 --> 01:23:27.704
Do you feel guilty or something?

01:23:29.254 --> 01:23:30.460
Don't feel guilty.

01:23:32.132 --> 01:23:34.293
A child shouldn't feel guilty
about nothing.

01:23:44.478 --> 01:23:45.478
You...

01:23:46.438 --> 01:23:48.645
You don't feel anything, do ya?

01:23:49.066 --> 01:23:54.811
Guilt, pain, regret, nothing, do
ya?

01:23:56.865 --> 01:23:59.823
Who are you to judge me?

01:24:13.131 --> 01:24:16.168
You have no soul to redeem.

01:24:18.178 --> 01:24:19.964
Do you?

01:24:28.564 --> 01:24:30.896
Don't try anything funny while
I'm gone.

01:24:32.025 --> 01:24:34.186
They're watching.

01:26:45.867 --> 01:26:49.075
Oh my god. What did he do to
you?

01:26:50.831 --> 01:26:52.913
I'm gonna get you out of here.

01:26:53.458 --> 01:26:54.948
I'm sorry.

01:27:08.473 --> 01:27:09.883
You'll be okay.

01:27:13.729 --> 01:27:14.969
C'mon.

01:27:16.690 --> 01:27:18.772
Come on, it's okay.

01:27:31.371 --> 01:27:33.953
I... I can't carry you.

01:27:35.292 --> 01:27:37.248
Is this what you're scared of?

01:27:37.961 --> 01:27:38.961
This thing?

01:27:42.674 --> 01:27:44.164
You see?

01:27:44.718 --> 01:27:46.208
It's nothing.

01:27:57.939 --> 01:27:59.930
When are they coming home?

01:28:00.567 --> 01:28:01.682
Soon.

01:28:45.487 --> 01:28:47.227
Finally.

01:28:59.876 --> 01:29:00.956
Yes?

01:29:04.506 --> 01:29:05.506
Wendy, run!

01:29:06.842 --> 01:29:07.842
Mommy!

01:29:18.603 --> 01:29:19.603
Mommy!

01:29:19.813 --> 01:29:21.144
Wendy, run!

01:29:21.690 --> 01:29:22.690
Run!

01:29:34.077 --> 01:29:35.077
No, please don't!

01:29:35.287 --> 01:29:36.287
Have to.

01:29:45.964 --> 01:29:47.704
We're almost there.

01:30:09.571 --> 01:30:11.232
Jonathan.

01:30:38.600 --> 01:30:39.965
No.

01:30:51.655 --> 01:30:53.316
It's gonna be ok.

01:30:54.532 --> 01:30:57.023
I'm gonna get you home.

01:31:13.510 --> 01:31:14.625
Randy!

01:31:14.928 --> 01:31:15.928
Oh, Randy!

01:31:31.653 --> 01:31:33.268
It's going to be ok.

01:31:42.664 --> 01:31:43.664
Please!

01:31:44.165 --> 01:31:45.826
Don't hurt my animals.

01:31:53.675 --> 01:31:54.790
No...

01:32:09.941 --> 01:32:12.603
Ate from my hand.

01:32:16.156 --> 01:32:18.112
Trusted me.

01:32:18.408 --> 01:32:19.989
Even at the end.

01:32:22.579 --> 01:32:25.366
Unconditional.

01:32:25.749 --> 01:32:26.989
He...

01:32:27.375 --> 01:32:28.375
He made Mel

01:32:28.585 --> 01:32:29.916
mommy!

01:32:38.136 --> 01:32:40.422
I'm making things right.

01:32:40.889 --> 01:32:42.254
I owe them that much.

01:32:43.725 --> 01:32:45.636
With each one.

01:32:47.896 --> 01:32:50.137
Another sin is forgiven.

01:32:51.149 --> 01:32:52.685
L... can't let it happen again.

01:32:54.569 --> 01:32:55.934
Not like me.

01:33:02.619 --> 01:33:03.734
You understand...

01:33:04.287 --> 01:33:05.287
Don'tya?

01:33:05.497 --> 01:33:07.658
Not like that boy.

01:33:08.291 --> 01:33:09.326
Worthless.

01:33:13.588 --> 01:33:14.919
Karen?

01:33:19.302 --> 01:33:20.337
Karen...

01:33:21.971 --> 01:33:22.971
Don't...

01:33:24.057 --> 01:33:25.922
Let him get her.

01:33:31.314 --> 01:33:33.100
I can't stop now.

01:33:34.609 --> 01:33:36.099
There's still so much more to
do.

01:33:36.569 --> 01:33:38.059
You... you come with me.

01:33:38.738 --> 01:33:39.738
Come with me.

01:33:40.073 --> 01:33:41.073
No.

01:33:41.699 --> 01:33:42.779
Please, come with me.

01:33:43.243 --> 01:33:44.243
Help me.

01:33:44.327 --> 01:33:46.739
Help me redeem myself!

01:33:47.122 --> 01:33:48.783
No! Let her go you son of a
bitch!

01:33:56.673 --> 01:33:57.879
It does...

01:33:59.634 --> 01:34:00.919
I'm sorry.

01:34:10.854 --> 01:34:11.889
It's ok.

01:34:12.188 --> 01:34:13.803
It's me, it's just me.

01:34:15.817 --> 01:34:17.023
Where's mommy?

01:34:17.485 --> 01:34:18.850
She's downstairs.

01:34:24.325 --> 01:34:26.441
I need you to stay here.

01:34:26.786 --> 01:34:27.366
Alright?

01:34:27.704 --> 01:34:28.238
Why?

01:34:28.538 --> 01:34:30.824
Just please do as I say. Ok?

01:34:31.166 --> 01:34:32.166
Don't leave!

01:34:32.458 --> 01:34:34.540
I'm not leaving, just stay here.

01:34:49.893 --> 01:34:51.178
Martin?

01:34:57.317 --> 01:34:58.648
Oh no!

01:35:06.117 --> 01:35:07.152
Martin!

01:35:15.960 --> 01:35:18.542
911, what is your emergency?

01:35:18.838 --> 01:35:19.838
Yes, hello?

01:37:39.771 --> 01:37:40.771
Boy?

01:38:30.071 --> 01:38:31.527
I understand now.

01:38:32.824 --> 01:38:34.314
Why they run.

01:38:37.161 --> 01:38:40.699
Cause even a dumb animal.

01:38:42.458 --> 01:38:44.540
Knows when it's been betrayed.

01:38:56.472 --> 01:38:58.713
Do you feel betrayed?

01:39:01.853 --> 01:39:02.853
No...

01:39:04.230 --> 01:39:05.811
That's why you didn't run.

01:39:07.066 --> 01:39:08.647
Cause you knew you had it
coming!

01:39:18.286 --> 01:39:19.366
You...

01:39:22.039 --> 01:39:24.451
You never ran.

01:39:29.964 --> 01:39:30.964
My boy.

01:39:44.395 --> 01:39:45.805
Thank you.

01:40:51.254 --> 01:40:53.495
Tried to call for help.

01:40:53.923 --> 01:40:55.709
But the flames consumed them.

01:41:06.102 --> 01:41:07.558
Yeah.

01:41:36.549 --> 01:41:37.755
(Bottle rattling

01:41:38.092 --> 01:41:39.548
Billy?

01:41:43.806 --> 01:41:45.387
Billy?

01:48:10.818 --> 01:48:12.103
Help!

01:48:47.479 --> 01:48:49.470
Hello?

01:48:54.820 --> 01:48:56.811
Is anybody here?

01:49:01.243 --> 01:49:04.201
Can you help me?
