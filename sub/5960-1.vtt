00:34.875 --> 00:36.968
<i>During the spookiest time of the year...</i>

00:37.144 --> 00:40.910
<i>... there are a few guidelines
all ghosts and goblins should follow.</i>

00:41.081 --> 00:43.072
<i>Always stay on sidewalks.</i>

00:43.250 --> 00:47.448
<i>Never go to a stranger's house,
and never go out alone.</i>

01:08.008 --> 01:11.500
This is a great idea, honey. Really.

01:11.845 --> 01:13.472
It's just magical.

01:13.881 --> 01:15.872
It makes me wish every night
was Halloween.

01:16.049 --> 01:17.880
I'm sorry, Em.

01:19.219 --> 01:20.811
- Wait, wait. Not yet.
- What?

01:20.988 --> 01:23.456
- You're supposed to keep it lit.
- Why?

01:23.624 --> 01:25.216
Ancient tradition?

01:25.392 --> 01:28.486
Henry, it's Halloween, not Hanukkah.

01:28.662 --> 01:30.823
- Baby, I'm lit and you're lit.
- But honey...

01:30.998 --> 01:33.523
But our little friend here?
His night's over.

01:35.903 --> 01:37.666
You know, you should be more careful.

01:37.838 --> 01:39.567
There are rules.
You might upset someone.

01:39.740 --> 01:42.300
Oh, please. Who?

02:01.795 --> 02:03.285
What?

02:03.830 --> 02:05.491
Inside. Upstairs.

02:05.666 --> 02:08.726
Let's just take all this crap down.
It looks like a crime scene.

02:08.901 --> 02:11.336
- I told you I'd do it in the morning.
- No, you won't.

02:11.505 --> 02:14.804
You're gonna sleep until noon
and then play video games until 4.

02:14.975 --> 02:18.604
And besides, my mom is coming and
she'll have an aneurysm if she sees this.

02:18.779 --> 02:20.041
Really?

02:21.248 --> 02:22.272
I'll do it.

02:31.358 --> 02:34.384
Go inside. Put on the tape.

02:46.073 --> 02:48.667
I hate Halloween.

03:59.880 --> 04:01.677
What took you guys so long?

04:08.188 --> 04:09.553
Happy Halloween.

04:22.602 --> 04:26.902
<i>Yeah! Oh, baby!</i>

04:30.043 --> 04:32.978
Henry!

05:19.526 --> 05:21.016
Emma?

08:37.123 --> 08:40.785
<i>Werewolves, zombies
and demons of every variety.</i>

08:40.960 --> 08:42.052
<i>They've all descended...</i>

08:42.227 --> 08:45.288
<i>... on the normally sleepy town
of Warren valley, Ohio...</i>

08:45.465 --> 08:48.093
<i>... where the holiday
and all of its strange traditions...</i>

08:48.268 --> 08:50.327
<i>... are taken very seriously.</i>

08:50.503 --> 08:54.234
<i>It's only 8:00 and the streets are already
packed with costumed visitors...</i>

08:54.407 --> 08:56.637
<i>... some to show off, others to blend in...</i>

08:56.810 --> 08:59.802
<i>... but all to celebrate the magical night
of Halloween...</i>

08:59.979 --> 09:03.938
...the one night a year when we can pretend
to be the scariest thing we can think of.

09:08.655 --> 09:12.682
I am not wearing this. It's too small.

09:12.859 --> 09:14.918
- My tits keep popping out.
- That's the idea.

09:15.095 --> 09:18.189
Don't know why we drove here
when there are guys in the city.

09:18.365 --> 09:19.354
Fresh meat.

09:19.532 --> 09:21.159
It's what we do every Halloween, Laurie.

09:21.334 --> 09:22.801
Whatever happened to trick-or-treating?

09:22.969 --> 09:24.960
Puberty.
Last year we were in Tampa.

09:25.138 --> 09:26.298
And went as sexy nurses.

09:26.473 --> 09:30.068
No, Janet, Tampa was two
years ago. I remember because you puked...

09:30.243 --> 09:31.710
...doing a guy in his pickup.

09:31.878 --> 09:34.210
I ate some bad Mexican,
and it was a Jeep.

09:34.381 --> 09:38.340
Last year was San Diego. We
dressed as sailors and ended up with sailors.

09:38.518 --> 09:40.679
Yeah, and Maria's sailor was a girl.

09:40.854 --> 09:45.791
So what? She had a nice ass.
It all tastes the same to me anyway.

09:45.959 --> 09:47.722
Ladies, there are children out here.

09:49.429 --> 09:52.865
Okay, all of you come out
on the count of three. One, two, three.

09:58.671 --> 10:01.765
- Nice.
- Right.

10:06.880 --> 10:09.474
- Laurie, come on out.
- No.

10:09.649 --> 10:11.241
- Open up.
- No.

10:11.418 --> 10:15.980
Open the door,
or we'll huff and we'll puff...

10:16.823 --> 10:19.053
Come on, seriously, open up.

10:19.225 --> 10:21.489
Fine, just don't laugh, okay?

10:31.538 --> 10:34.939
Danielle, I look like I'm 5.

10:35.108 --> 10:36.803
Shut up, you look great.

10:38.578 --> 10:40.102
- It's tradition.
- Great.

10:40.280 --> 10:43.738
- What does tradition say we do now?
- We meet our dates.

10:45.752 --> 10:48.050
Two thirty-three, 30-D.

10:48.588 --> 10:50.215
I mean, $234.33.

10:51.591 --> 10:52.615
Thanks.

10:52.792 --> 10:56.660
You know, this might sound kind of
forward, but well, we're just in town...

10:56.830 --> 11:00.266
...for a party tonight, and I was wondering
what time you get off work.

11:03.136 --> 11:04.933
In about 20 minutes, actually.

11:05.104 --> 11:07.265
Yeah? You know
where Sheep's Meadow is?

11:07.440 --> 11:08.737
Sure, yeah, of course.

11:08.908 --> 11:11.206
All right. So why don't you
meet me there in 45?

11:12.111 --> 11:14.579
Okay, I guess.

11:15.081 --> 11:17.049
Don't forget your costume.

12:02.629 --> 12:05.621
That can't be good
for your diabetes, Charlie.

12:07.300 --> 12:09.825
Don't waste a good lie on this.

12:10.003 --> 12:11.493
It's just candy.

12:11.671 --> 12:13.639
Guess it's a good thing I got more.

12:13.806 --> 12:16.206
Why don't you sit down,
stay for a minute?

12:16.376 --> 12:19.641
- Oh, I can't. I have...
- Sit down, Charlie.

12:20.980 --> 12:24.416
Your problem is simple.
You always wait for them to come to you.

12:24.584 --> 12:28.782
If you just tried a little harder,
you wouldn't be a virgin at 22.

12:28.955 --> 12:30.582
What? Excuse me?

12:30.757 --> 12:33.624
It's practically stapled to your forehead.

12:33.793 --> 12:36.227
Laurie, please,
do not listen to them, okay?

12:36.396 --> 12:38.455
The key thing is to just be yourself.

12:39.232 --> 12:41.462
Being myself hasn't gotten me very far.

12:41.634 --> 12:45.035
Maybe I'm too old-fashioned, but I've
always wanted my first time to be...

12:45.204 --> 12:47.468
- No, please, don't say it.
- Special.

12:48.174 --> 12:51.701
Honey, listen, we've all been there,
but you can't hesitate.

12:52.412 --> 12:54.346
Watch.

13:00.119 --> 13:02.815
That's some big equipment
you've got there.

13:04.490 --> 13:07.687
- Thank you.
- I'm Maria. This is Janet.

13:07.860 --> 13:10.795
- And we have a small problem.
- Really?

13:10.964 --> 13:13.694
We've got this great party to go to...

13:16.169 --> 13:17.727
But we don't have any dates.

13:22.609 --> 13:25.601
Here. Help yourself.

13:26.179 --> 13:30.081
It's for the pumpkin, not you. Promise.

13:30.249 --> 13:32.080
All of mine were dull.

13:40.093 --> 13:43.961
Smashing jack-o'- lanterns?
Stealing candy?

13:44.130 --> 13:47.861
It's okay. Believe it or not,
I was just like you when I was a kid.

13:48.601 --> 13:50.728
Till my dad set me straight, that is.

13:50.903 --> 13:55.363
See, my dad taught me
tonight is about respecting the dead...

13:55.541 --> 13:58.704
...because this is the one night
that the dead...

13:58.878 --> 14:04.077
...and all sorts of other things roam free
and pay us a visit.

14:05.218 --> 14:06.708
Sorry.

14:07.086 --> 14:09.020
All these traditions...

14:09.188 --> 14:14.387
...jack-o'- lanterns, putting on costumes,
handing out treats...

14:14.560 --> 14:18.758
...they were started to protect us,
but nowadays...

14:19.766 --> 14:21.996
...no one really cares.

14:22.168 --> 14:23.897
Yeah.

14:26.305 --> 14:27.966
I didn't do such a good job, did I?

14:29.208 --> 14:30.232
What do you think?

14:33.279 --> 14:34.769
Hey.

14:36.516 --> 14:38.211
You okay?

14:39.218 --> 14:40.947
You need a root beer?

14:44.590 --> 14:45.921
Oh, wait.

14:46.092 --> 14:49.027
That's right. There's another tradition.

14:49.729 --> 14:52.163
A very important one.

14:53.966 --> 14:56.366
Always check your candy.

15:03.309 --> 15:05.106
Trick or...

15:42.081 --> 15:43.946
Ugh!

16:00.333 --> 16:02.028
Trick or treat!

16:04.771 --> 16:07.535
We know you're in there.
We can see you.

16:09.208 --> 16:12.974
Hello!
Just a minute!

16:18.551 --> 16:21.179
Wait. No, no. Shh!

16:25.057 --> 16:26.524
Great costume, Mr. Wilkins.

16:27.660 --> 16:30.060
Oy.

16:31.030 --> 16:33.328
Oh, right, candy.

16:34.667 --> 16:36.157
Thanks.

16:36.702 --> 16:41.537
Principal Wilkins, do you think we might
be able to have your jack-o'- lantern, please?

16:41.707 --> 16:47.407
- You're not gonna smash it, are you?
- No, it's a scavenger hunt for UNICEF.

16:48.247 --> 16:50.772
Anything for a good cause.

16:56.789 --> 16:59.121
Happy Halloween.

16:59.525 --> 17:03.188
Yeah. Happy Halloween.

17:06.732 --> 17:08.597
Didn't you get one?

17:22.848 --> 17:24.077
Are you sure about this?

17:24.250 --> 17:26.309
There's gotta be one or two
extra guys there.

17:26.484 --> 17:29.249
- I could help you.
- Go. I'll meet you there.

17:29.789 --> 17:31.347
Call me if you get into trouble.

17:31.524 --> 17:33.116
You're turning into Mom.

17:33.292 --> 17:34.850
Ouch.

17:35.027 --> 17:38.485
- Just remember to be yourself.
- But play hard to get.

17:38.664 --> 17:39.961
Goodbye, Danielle!

18:22.275 --> 18:23.742
Happy Halloween.

18:30.249 --> 18:34.686
Daddy!
I'm back from trick-or-treating!

18:34.854 --> 18:36.253
Billy. Shh.

18:36.422 --> 18:38.890
- Please, be quiet.
- Why?

18:39.292 --> 18:41.260
Because you'll bother the neighbors.

18:41.427 --> 18:44.624
<i>Now go watch Charlie Brown
and I'll be in in a minute.</i>

18:44.797 --> 18:49.393
- Charlie Brown's an asshole!
- Billy Wilkins. Language.

19:23.769 --> 19:25.396
Wait, hold on.

19:27.740 --> 19:29.765
Come on. There you...

19:36.215 --> 19:37.409
Yeah.

19:37.583 --> 19:39.881
Here you go. Go get it! Shit.

19:46.659 --> 19:48.286
Spite!

19:54.967 --> 19:57.663
Spite! Get your ass in here.

20:00.306 --> 20:01.705
Are you finished crapping or what?

20:04.110 --> 20:05.134
Who the hell is that?

20:07.179 --> 20:09.739
I got an NRA membership in my pocket...

20:09.915 --> 20:12.179
...and a shotgun over the fireplace,
so get out...

20:12.351 --> 20:14.649
It's me, Mr. Kreeg.

20:14.820 --> 20:17.482
Steven. Steven Wilkins.

20:17.656 --> 20:21.148
What in God's name are you doing
down there, Wilkins? Hiding bodies?

20:23.329 --> 20:24.318
What did you say?

20:25.664 --> 20:26.722
Nothing.

20:26.899 --> 20:29.367
The septic tank is acting up.

20:29.535 --> 20:32.436
- Is that what that smell is?
- I'm afraid so.

20:32.605 --> 20:36.097
Then fix it!
It stinks like a dead whore out here.

20:36.776 --> 20:38.141
I'm...

20:38.978 --> 20:40.275
...trying.

20:41.714 --> 20:43.682
Keep your kid out of my yard!

20:45.017 --> 20:46.951
Goddamn freak.

20:48.687 --> 20:51.952
- Happy Halloween.
- Screw you!

21:03.903 --> 21:05.370
Daddy!

21:05.538 --> 21:09.998
I wanna carve the jack-o'- lantern now,
but I need your help with the eyes.

21:10.176 --> 21:11.643
In a minute, Billy.

21:12.411 --> 21:14.845
And can I go to the parade
with you later?

21:15.014 --> 21:17.539
No, Daddy has a date.

21:17.716 --> 21:21.152
Oh! But we haven't done anything
fun together.

21:21.320 --> 21:26.417
How about if we make some
caramel apples, just like Grandpa used to?

21:26.592 --> 21:29.060
- How about that?
- When?

21:29.228 --> 21:34.894
After we carve the jack-o'- lantern,
but you have to be quiet.

21:35.067 --> 21:36.295
Okay.

21:43.342 --> 21:46.573
But don't forget to help me
with the eyes!

22:00.659 --> 22:03.890
"Daddy, I wanna carve a pumpkin."

22:04.063 --> 22:06.896
"Daddy, I wanna go to the parade."

22:07.066 --> 22:10.399
"Daddy, I wish Mommy was still alive."

22:20.146 --> 22:24.048
Wilkins! Wilkins, over here! Wilkins!

22:24.216 --> 22:25.547
Help me, goddamn it!

22:26.318 --> 22:27.751
Help me!

22:27.920 --> 22:30.821
- Help me!
- Screw you.

22:36.529 --> 22:39.327
Billy!

22:53.946 --> 22:55.846
Gotcha.

23:00.186 --> 23:02.120
So can we carve it now?

23:04.490 --> 23:06.355
Yeah.

23:07.193 --> 23:08.854
Let's go downstairs.

24:09.388 --> 24:13.222
Let's carve a scary face this time.

24:14.193 --> 24:16.821
A scary face it is.

24:36.749 --> 24:39.479
Wrap it around.

24:41.387 --> 24:45.153
But don't forget to help me
with the eyes.

25:00.839 --> 25:02.101
Trick or treat!

25:05.477 --> 25:08.275
Aren't you guys adorable?

25:08.447 --> 25:12.543
Thanks, Mrs. Henderson.
That's a great costume.

25:12.718 --> 25:17.712
I know. Isn't it just "purr-fect"?

25:19.725 --> 25:23.217
You want a drink or something?
It'll be our little secret.

25:23.395 --> 25:26.956
- Sure.
- No, thanks. But...

25:27.132 --> 25:29.464
All right, fine. I'll see what I got for you.

25:29.635 --> 25:34.197
Actually, Mrs. Henderson,
we were wondering if you might...

25:36.842 --> 25:38.742
- If you might...
- Holy shit.

25:38.911 --> 25:42.677
...have a jack-o'- lantern we could borrow.

25:42.848 --> 25:45.078
Here you go.

25:45.250 --> 25:47.810
Now, be safe...

25:49.188 --> 25:51.315
...and watch out for monsters.

25:53.659 --> 25:55.889
I don't even know what that was.

25:56.061 --> 26:00.054
Coach Taylor was in a hot-dog costume
butt-fucking a pig.

26:00.232 --> 26:03.326
- I think. And then...
- Chip. Let's just not.

26:10.609 --> 26:13.009
- Trick or treat.
- What'd you find?

26:14.480 --> 26:15.606
That's it?

26:15.781 --> 26:18.841
Sorry, but some asshole went
down the street smashing all of them.

26:19.017 --> 26:20.951
But we have three. Isn't this enough?

26:22.087 --> 26:23.281
Almost.

26:31.530 --> 26:33.327
Macy, why didn't we just start here?

26:33.499 --> 26:35.990
I didn't know she'd do this.

26:38.036 --> 26:39.128
This is weird.

26:40.806 --> 26:42.364
Is that Rhonda the retard?

26:42.541 --> 26:44.668
She's not a retard, she's an idiot savant.

26:44.843 --> 26:46.435
Here she comes.

26:50.349 --> 26:51.373
You're on, Schrader.

27:02.728 --> 27:04.855
Did you carve all these yourself?

27:05.898 --> 27:10.198
Yeah. Made my costume too.
Like it?

27:10.369 --> 27:11.768
I do.

27:12.971 --> 27:14.871
I'm Schrader.

27:15.574 --> 27:17.439
Rhonda.

27:44.970 --> 27:46.403
Let's get another drink.

29:08.253 --> 29:09.515
Henry.

29:12.057 --> 29:14.992
- I need help.
- She's just drunk, baby. Come on.

30:14.987 --> 30:16.955
You must really like Halloween.

30:17.122 --> 30:20.353
- You mean Samhain?
- What?

30:20.525 --> 30:24.518
Samhain, also known as All Hallows' Eve,
also known as Halloween.

30:24.696 --> 30:27.062
Pre-dating Christianity,
the Celtic holiday...

30:27.232 --> 30:30.201
...was celebrated on the one
night between autumn and winter...

30:30.369 --> 30:33.065
...when the barrier between living
and dead was thinnest...

30:33.238 --> 30:37.231
...and often involved rituals
that included human sacrifice.

30:41.680 --> 30:43.807
I like your eye patch.

31:13.478 --> 31:17.005
Great, a rock quarry.
Nice way to celebrate Halloween, Macy.

31:17.182 --> 31:20.242
- Why are we here?
- To pay our respects to the dead.

31:20.419 --> 31:23.081
What happened? Did somebody die here?

31:23.255 --> 31:24.313
Wait.

31:24.990 --> 31:26.082
Is this where...?

31:26.792 --> 31:30.319
- It is, isn't it? This is where that school...
- Shut up, Sara.

31:30.495 --> 31:32.087
The Halloween School Bus Massacre.

31:32.264 --> 31:35.256
- Just don't call it that.
- What's she talking about?

31:35.434 --> 31:37.766
It's this awesome town legend.
There was this bus...

31:37.936 --> 31:40.496
Jesus, will you shut up
and let me tell the damn story?

31:42.140 --> 31:43.801
You said a bad word.

31:49.347 --> 31:51.838
It happened 30 years ago...

31:52.017 --> 31:56.511
...on a late Halloween afternoon.

32:04.763 --> 32:07.630
<i>A school bus was on its usual route.</i>

32:09.367 --> 32:12.393
<i>But this wasn't your typical school bus...</i>

32:12.904 --> 32:15.702
<i>... and they weren't your typical kids.</i>

32:21.947 --> 32:23.642
<i>There were eight of them...</i>

32:24.416 --> 32:25.974
<i>... and they were different.</i>

32:26.585 --> 32:28.052
<i>Troubled.</i>

32:28.220 --> 32:29.653
<i>Disturbed.</i>

32:31.523 --> 32:34.856
<i>Every day, parents put their dirty secrets
on this bus...</i>

32:35.026 --> 32:37.290
<i>... to be driven to a school
miles outside of town.</i>

32:37.462 --> 32:40.863
3260.

32:41.032 --> 32:44.866
3264.

32:45.036 --> 32:48.563
3266.

32:51.409 --> 32:53.172
<i>But that day...</i>

32:55.213 --> 32:57.010
<i>... the driver took a different route.</i>

33:05.490 --> 33:07.253
Wrong way.

33:07.659 --> 33:08.683
Wrong way.

33:16.034 --> 33:17.729
Wrong way.

33:18.103 --> 33:19.968
<i>And instead of
taking the students home...</i>

33:22.541 --> 33:25.135
<i>... he drove the bus
to an abandoned rock quarry.</i>

33:26.444 --> 33:29.242
This rock quarry.

33:42.060 --> 33:46.156
<i>The kids didn't know that over the years,
their parents had become exhausted...</i>

33:46.331 --> 33:48.094
<i>... embarrassed.</i>

33:54.406 --> 33:57.933
<i>And they were willing to do anything
to ease their burden.</i>

34:01.479 --> 34:05.916
<i>So one day, the parents approached
the bus driver and made him an offer.</i>

34:14.926 --> 34:16.416
Shh.

34:16.594 --> 34:21.190
<i>With the money they collected together,
they asked him to do the unthinkable.</i>

34:35.947 --> 34:37.437
<i>It almost worked perfectly.</i>

34:38.884 --> 34:40.647
Wrong way.

34:41.887 --> 34:43.547
Wrong way.

34:47.292 --> 34:49.692
Home. Home.

34:50.594 --> 34:51.687
I wanna go home.

34:54.666 --> 34:55.690
I wanna go home.

35:02.974 --> 35:04.669
Home.

35:11.383 --> 35:13.214
Home. Home.

35:16.988 --> 35:19.252
Home! Go home!

35:21.393 --> 35:22.951
Home.

36:01.733 --> 36:04.224
<i>The driver was never heard from again.</i>

36:21.753 --> 36:27.817
<i>As for the bus, some say
it sank so deep that it couldn't be found.</i>

36:27.993 --> 36:31.292
<i>Others say the town
just didn't want it to be found.</i>

36:32.697 --> 36:35.325
For all we know, it's still down there...

36:36.434 --> 36:39.164
...and so are those kids.

36:45.910 --> 36:48.242
You are so full of shit.

36:48.413 --> 36:49.880
Really?

36:50.048 --> 36:51.879
Then I guess
you won't mind being first.

36:52.050 --> 36:53.881
First what?

36:54.052 --> 36:57.783
Eight victims, eight jack-o'- lanterns...

36:58.156 --> 37:00.954
...each one representing a lost soul.

37:01.126 --> 37:04.061
So we're going to leave them
by the side of the lake...

37:04.229 --> 37:06.026
...as an offering to those who died.

37:35.493 --> 37:37.222
Is that one of yours?

37:38.430 --> 37:40.091
Yes.

37:40.265 --> 37:41.789
It's very pretty.

37:43.034 --> 37:44.797
Thank you.

38:04.656 --> 38:07.591
It can only hold three safely.

38:08.526 --> 38:12.360
I'll send the keys back up.
You guys bring the rest.

38:12.530 --> 38:14.361
Uh... Okay.

39:02.080 --> 39:03.809
I can't do this.
If you put me in a box...

39:05.150 --> 39:06.708
...it makes me feel like
you're not proud of me.

39:06.885 --> 39:09.012
If you're not proud of me...

39:09.854 --> 39:12.414
- Hello?
- Who's your favorite big sister?

39:17.228 --> 39:18.422
<i>You there?</i>

39:20.899 --> 39:22.127
Yeah. Hi.

39:22.300 --> 39:25.269
So there's a guy here
who really wants to meet you.

39:25.436 --> 39:26.960
Is he young? Cute?

39:28.706 --> 39:31.004
Uh... Yeah.
Yeah, no, you could say that.

39:31.176 --> 39:33.303
<i>He's really, really nice.</i>

39:33.478 --> 39:35.002
So he's hideous.

39:35.180 --> 39:39.082
Just get your ass over here.
Beggars can't be choosers.

39:43.388 --> 39:44.582
Nice.

39:45.890 --> 39:47.255
Great.

39:47.425 --> 39:49.086
Not now, Andrew.

39:49.260 --> 39:51.558
- Josh.
- Whatever.

39:58.002 --> 39:59.993
Werewolves.

40:02.507 --> 40:03.997
Very funny.

40:17.889 --> 40:20.551
That bus is around here somewhere.
I think it's over here.

40:20.725 --> 40:24.092
Over where? I can't see shit
in this fog. Think I found a dead retard.

40:24.262 --> 40:26.856
That's me, asshole.
Like I said.

40:27.031 --> 40:29.659
Both of you shut up and keep looking.

40:29.834 --> 40:31.961
There's something moving by that rock.

40:32.136 --> 40:34.229
I can't see.
Jesus, what is that?

40:35.573 --> 40:36.597
Help me!

40:36.774 --> 40:39.538
Sara! Where's Sara?

40:40.712 --> 40:42.202
Run!

40:42.380 --> 40:45.315
There's nowhere to go.
Up! I wanna go back up!

41:01.299 --> 41:04.757
Macy? Schrader? Sara?

41:23.721 --> 41:27.020
Aren't you coming? Okay, stay here.

41:27.191 --> 41:30.683
Don't let the candles go out
and they'll protect you, okay?

44:36.848 --> 44:38.782
Oh, shit.

44:42.820 --> 44:44.412
Is she dead?

44:44.589 --> 44:46.056
Hey.

44:50.595 --> 44:52.358
Rhonda.

44:53.197 --> 44:54.960
Rhonda.

45:08.212 --> 45:10.077
It was all going so well.

45:11.916 --> 45:15.113
- You're all dead!
- Rhonda, calm down.

45:15.286 --> 45:17.413
It was all just a trick.

45:17.588 --> 45:21.547
Look, none of this is real.
It was just a trick.

45:22.293 --> 45:25.285
- A bad joke.
- I'd say it was a pretty good one.

45:25.730 --> 45:27.095
Shut up.

45:31.969 --> 45:33.027
Here, let me see.

45:38.009 --> 45:39.738
Does it hurt?

45:48.019 --> 45:50.351
- Go pack everything up. We're leaving.
- Says who?

45:50.521 --> 45:54.821
Macy, she's scared out of her mind.
What else do you want?

45:59.530 --> 46:00.861
Let's go.

46:07.698 --> 46:09.893
This one's still lit.

46:17.808 --> 46:21.335
If this was all a trick,
then how did the school bus get here?

46:21.512 --> 46:24.879
- That part's true.
- What happened to the bus driver?

46:25.049 --> 46:26.539
I don't know, Chip.

46:28.352 --> 46:31.219
- What?
- I didn't say anything.

46:33.190 --> 46:36.853
- I'm not in the mood.
- It wasn't me.

46:40.030 --> 46:41.156
What is that?

46:49.840 --> 46:52.570
- Schrader!
- Not again.

46:54.078 --> 46:57.013
- Over here!
- Wait here.

46:58.983 --> 47:00.416
Help us!

47:01.618 --> 47:03.518
Schrader!

47:13.230 --> 47:15.130
- Schrader!
- What the hell?

47:15.299 --> 47:17.324
We have to go.
We have to get out of here.

47:17.501 --> 47:19.298
- Calm down.
- We have to go!

47:19.470 --> 47:20.732
- Look, Macy...
- Listen to me!

47:20.904 --> 47:23.737
We heard voices.
There are other people here.

47:29.446 --> 47:30.811
What is that?

47:55.672 --> 47:56.969
Help me! Help me!

47:59.176 --> 48:01.736
No. Run.

48:06.617 --> 48:08.084
Rhonda, open the gate.

48:08.252 --> 48:10.015
- Let us in, please!
- Open the gate!

48:12.122 --> 48:13.180
Open the gate, please.

48:21.231 --> 48:22.289
Come on.

48:26.203 --> 48:28.262
Open the gate.

48:32.376 --> 48:34.936
- No! Rhonda, look at me.
- What are you doing?

48:35.112 --> 48:37.444
It's not a trick, it's real.

48:37.614 --> 48:38.774
Come back!

48:40.184 --> 48:43.642
Where is she going?
Rhonda!

48:43.821 --> 48:45.789
- No, no!
- It's not a trick!

49:09.980 --> 49:12.210
Help me, please!

50:04.801 --> 50:07.565
I'm not in the mood,
so just come on out.

50:21.018 --> 50:24.010
Oh, my God. She's so funny.

50:27.758 --> 50:29.248
No, thanks.

50:30.961 --> 50:33.225
She's a big girl.
She can take care of herself.

50:34.131 --> 50:36.156
I wish that were true.

50:36.333 --> 50:38.927
Mom always said
she was the runt of the litter.

50:47.711 --> 50:50.202
My, my...

50:50.380 --> 50:54.544
...what big eyes you have.

50:57.754 --> 51:00.120
So where's this guy
you're setting her up with?

51:00.290 --> 51:01.348
The nice one?

51:15.038 --> 51:16.528
Laurie.

51:41.098 --> 51:42.622
Oh, my God.

51:46.970 --> 51:50.133
Please, help me.

52:07.357 --> 52:09.086
There she is.

52:10.994 --> 52:12.586
Laurie, what's going on?

52:13.263 --> 52:14.594
You're late.

52:15.332 --> 52:18.267
Sorry. It took longer than I thought.

52:19.002 --> 52:20.902
What did he do to you?

52:21.772 --> 52:25.731
I listened to their advice
and played hard to get. He bit me.

52:29.513 --> 52:32.880
Well, at least you made it. Drink?

52:34.151 --> 52:35.516
Sure.

52:38.822 --> 52:40.517
Come here.

52:42.626 --> 52:45.823
- Please.
- Say "ah."

52:57.074 --> 52:58.598
Not bad.

53:02.612 --> 53:04.136
What's your name, honey?

53:05.782 --> 53:07.147
Steven.

53:07.317 --> 53:09.945
- Steven?
- Steven Wilkins.

53:10.120 --> 53:14.216
I'm glad you're her first, I really am.
I like you.

53:14.958 --> 53:16.653
Who are you people?

53:50.394 --> 53:52.191
I'm nervous.

53:53.997 --> 53:55.259
Hey.

53:56.533 --> 53:58.660
You're gonna be fine.

53:59.035 --> 54:01.196
Just be yourself.

54:21.658 --> 54:24.218
It's my first time...

54:24.728 --> 54:27.322
...so just bear with me.

55:15.312 --> 55:16.677
What are you doing?

55:54.751 --> 55:56.742
My, my...

55:56.920 --> 56:01.721
...what big eyes you have.

57:40.924 --> 57:44.121
Trick or treat.

58:55.965 --> 58:58.297
<i>You push it in, you slide the food in.</i>

58:58.468 --> 59:00.766
<i>It pops right out, okay?</i>

59:00.937 --> 59:05.499
<i>I'm gonna take this device.
I've done it three times already, inside.</i>

59:05.675 --> 59:08.644
<i>I'm gonna show the folks
how to put it on the spit rod.</i>

59:08.812 --> 59:10.609
<i>It's so darn easy.</i>

59:10.780 --> 59:14.944
<i>I take the meat, and all I'm gonna do
is just center it like this.</i>

59:15.118 --> 59:16.278
<i>It goes down.</i>

59:18.088 --> 59:20.318
<i>I'll put the wheel on.
It's as simple as this.</i>

59:20.490 --> 59:23.254
<i>This is about a 7-pound
pork loin roast.</i>

59:23.426 --> 59:28.329
<i>I'll put it in the machine, I'll slide it back,
put up the window.</i>

59:28.531 --> 59:31.125
<i>- You set it, and?
- Forget it!</i>

59:31.301 --> 59:34.634
<i>Right. I'm gonna go over
to the pork loin roast over here now...</i>

59:35.939 --> 59:39.340
<i>... and I'm gonna take this one out.
This has been done...</i>

59:39.509 --> 59:42.444
<i>It's only 8:00, and the streets
are packed with visitors...</i>

59:42.612 --> 59:44.603
<i>... some to show off, others to blend in...</i>

59:44.781 --> 59:47.443
<i>... but all to celebrate the magical night
of Halloween.</i>

59:55.692 --> 59:58.923
<i>Baked goods and crops
were left out as offerings for the dead...</i>

59:59.095 --> 01:00:01.063
<i>... a custom now known
as trick-or-treating.</i>

01:00:01.231 --> 01:00:02.892
Christ.

01:00:03.066 --> 01:00:05.034
<i>Revolutionary. Now look.</i>

01:00:05.201 --> 01:00:09.035
<i>Let me just start cutting this over here
so that folks can see.</i>

01:00:09.839 --> 01:00:11.830
<i>This beautiful? Look at this
over here, folks, huh?</i>

01:00:13.510 --> 01:00:15.978
<i>Look how beautiful that pork looks
with all its injected flavors on the...</i>

01:00:59.255 --> 01:01:01.519
Happy Halloween.

01:01:05.495 --> 01:01:07.156
Spite?

01:01:07.764 --> 01:01:09.095
Spite.

01:01:21.845 --> 01:01:25.645
Spite. Get your ass in here.

01:01:32.922 --> 01:01:35.356
Are you finished crapping or what?

01:01:38.695 --> 01:01:40.720
Who the hell is that?

01:01:42.999 --> 01:01:45.593
I've got an NRA membership
in my pocket...

01:01:45.768 --> 01:01:49.067
...and a shotgun over the fireplace,
so get out of here before I...

01:01:49.239 --> 01:01:52.003
It's me, Mr. Kreeg.

01:01:52.175 --> 01:01:53.972
Steven. Steven Wilkins.

01:01:56.145 --> 01:02:00.673
What in God's name are you doing
down there, Wilkins? Hiding bodies?

01:02:04.754 --> 01:02:06.483
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

01:02:06.689 --> 01:02:08.657
The septic tank is acting up.

01:02:08.825 --> 01:02:10.258
Well, fix it!

01:02:10.426 --> 01:02:12.690
It stinks like a dead whore out here.

01:02:12.862 --> 01:02:16.059
I'm trying.

01:02:16.232 --> 01:02:18.097
Keep your kid out of my yard!

01:02:18.902 --> 01:02:21.166
Goddamn freak.

01:02:24.207 --> 01:02:26.038
Happy Halloween.

01:02:26.209 --> 01:02:28.200
Screw you!

01:02:44.928 --> 01:02:46.987
Get the hell off my!

01:03:45.555 --> 01:03:47.750
Well, zip-a-dee-doo-dah.

01:04:01.137 --> 01:04:02.695
Spite?

01:04:36.739 --> 01:04:38.331
Spite?

01:06:42.899 --> 01:06:45.060
Who the hell are you?

01:08:33.776 --> 01:08:36.370
Wilkins! Wilkins!

01:08:36.545 --> 01:08:40.948
Over here! Wilkins!
Wilkins, help me, goddamn it!

01:08:41.117 --> 01:08:43.676
Help me! Wilkins!

01:08:43.853 --> 01:08:45.184
Help me!

01:10:22.017 --> 01:10:25.544
<i>- 911, please hold.
- Hello? Hello?</i>

01:10:29.125 --> 01:10:30.956
<i>911, what is your emergency?</i>

01:10:31.127 --> 01:10:34.096
Yeah, I'd like to report...

01:10:34.263 --> 01:10:39.098
Hello? Hello? Hello?

01:11:12.067 --> 01:11:15.161
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

01:12:03.853 --> 01:12:06.014
Oh, no.

01:14:59.795 --> 01:15:01.763
Trick or treat.

01:15:07.102 --> 01:15:08.626
Thank you.

01:15:11.273 --> 01:15:13.002
Thank you.

01:15:16.478 --> 01:15:20.471
Thanks, Mr. Kreeg.
Great mummy costume.

01:15:43.572 --> 01:15:45.005
Thank you.

01:16:17.740 --> 01:16:20.174
This was a great idea, honey.

01:16:20.709 --> 01:16:24.270
It's just magical. It makes me wish
every night was Halloween.

01:16:26.949 --> 01:16:30.407
I'm sorry, Em. Wait, wait. Not yet.

01:16:31.987 --> 01:16:34.387
- What?
- You're supposed to keep it lit.

01:16:34.556 --> 01:16:36.854
- Why?
- Ancient tradition?

01:16:37.025 --> 01:16:41.655
Henry, it's Halloween, not Hanukkah.
Baby, I'm lit, and you're lit.

01:16:41.830 --> 01:16:45.527
But your little friend here?
His night's over.

01:16:47.002 --> 01:16:48.765
You know, you should be more careful.

01:16:48.937 --> 01:16:51.303
There are rules. You might upset someone.

01:16:51.473 --> 01:16:54.101
Oh, please. Who?

01:17:17.533 --> 01:17:21.060
Over here.

01:17:28.477 --> 01:17:30.206
Trick or treat.
