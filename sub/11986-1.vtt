I am deeply saddened to inform you

that Kelly Town is now a town
without a statue.

05:30.640 --> 05:33.633
This statue was the pride of the town,

05:33.760 --> 05:37.720
a memorial to our amazing
hot-air balloon captain Leopoldus.

05:37.840 --> 05:40.196
Since the boy was responsible
for ruining the statue,

05:40.320 --> 05:42.039
the boy must supply us with a new one.

05:42.160 --> 05:45.676
He's only a little boy.
By the way, his name is Albert.

Yeah, he can do that when he grows up.

05:48.400 --> 05:50.039

Well, in that case, it's settled then.

a real hot-air balloon captain

should we have, then?

- What's a scoundrel?

- It's a bandit!
- And what do they do?

07:23.520 --> 07:26.240
They smoke cigars and drink.

Then I don't wanna be
part of that club.

Great idea, Egon!
That's exactly what scoundrels do!

a pirates' club instead, Albert.

into the world with me.

- Maybe he's afraid of the unknown.
- He just needs time to think about it.

Then he'll probably wanna come along.

Let me give you a hand. I happen
to know quite a bit about goats.

30:49.920 --> 30:52.230
For example,
you wanna get your goat to market?

30:52.360 --> 30:55.114
You gotta pull it
in the opposite direction.

30:55.240 --> 30:58.995
They're stubborn like mules,
these goats. Whoa, boy, there you go.

30:59.120 --> 31:03.000
Amazing! Well, how can I thank you, sir?

31:03.120 --> 31:07.751
Will you please accept a humble coin?
Such goodwill is rare nowadays.

31:07.880 --> 31:10.952
Oh... oh... I've lost my wallet.
All my money.

31:11.080 --> 31:15.472
I must have dropped it somewhere.
What am I gonna do?

31:15.600 --> 31:18.240
Huh! What am I gonna tell 'em at home?

31:18.360 --> 31:19.874
Oh, I'm ruined!

31:20.000 --> 31:22.799
Oh, don't be silly. Don't mention it.

31:22.920 --> 31:26.072
You can give me something
when you sell your goat.

31:26.200 --> 31:29.477
It just so happens I'm on my way
to the market myself.

31:29.600 --> 31:32.069

31:38.920 --> 31:41.435
- No, you did not!
- Yes, I found it.

31:41.560 --> 31:44.155
In his pocket. (CACKLES)

31:44.280 --> 31:48.399
Yeah, right! The great Rapollo steals
from the rich and gives to the poor!

A real hot-air balloon!

JUMILLA:
Yeah, and the captain is my grandpa.

57:03.240 --> 57:05.516
He can see everything from up there.

57:10.680 --> 57:12.433
Oh, it's disappeared.

57:12.560 --> 57:16.349
We can ask my grandma to look in her
crystal ball and see where it's heading.

- Come on!
- Yeah!

We really are a couple of smart guys.

57:23.840 --> 57:25.593
GNALLE: And we caught that pesky boy.

57:25.720 --> 57:28.030
And got a hold of the diamond.

57:28.160 --> 57:30.914
- Now, we just need our reward.

57:43.320 --> 57:47.917
What has the great Rapollo done
to deserve this?

57:48.040 --> 57:51.829
- Uh...
- Uh... so what about our reward?

57:51.960 --> 57:56.239
- Reward? You brainless fool!
- Flying fish at starboard!

57:56.360 --> 58:00.957
Find that boy before he blabs to the
police! Then we can talk about a reward!

58:01.080 --> 58:06.519
But if he blabs to the police,
we'll go straight back to prison again.

58:06.640 --> 58:09.235
We definitely don't want that to happen.

58:09.360 --> 58:12.717

I gotta get hold of that diamond

- No, we're not!
- Oh, you're not?

01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:36.199
Then you couldn't have stolen a diamond.

No idea what you're talking about.

01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:41.911
Then you wouldn't mind
if we look in your pockets, kid.

01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:44.509
Certainly not, sir.

01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:48.111
Wait. I can't check your pockets
if your hands are in 'em.

It's not what you think.
Albert and Egon are innocent.

01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:16.120

to give him his diamond.

Yeah, sure. Everyone knows
that criminals

OK. But I will be back.

They don't look like much,
but they're dangerous.

When we caught them,
they lied and tried to escape!

01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:29.597
That's not true.
We wanted to return the diamond. Honest.

01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:32.076
That's right.
We didn't do anything wrong.

01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:34.192

but we thought...

It's not for you to think.
It's for us to know.

I'll never see them again.

But we told you! It wasn't our fault!

- We were tricked by some real robbers!
- Yeah, Tubbe, Gnalle and Rapollo!

What would it take
for you to believe us?

01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:49.751
I don't know. Maybe if an angel floats
down and confirms your explanation.

01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:52.793
And that's not very likely now, is it?

I recognized you from the statue.

Well, I will be darned!

01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:41.552

Well, that doesn't matter.

I've come here
to help two innocent boys.

Everything they say is true!

01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:54.470
Huh?

01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:59.277
I see things from my hot-air balloon.
Things that other people cannot see.

01:05:59.400 --> 01:06:01.790

would those be?

01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:07.398
Well, yeah, and I can guarantee you
that the real crooks

01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:10.354
are Rapollo, Gnalle and Tubbe.

01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:12.915
Albert thought the diamond
belonged to Rapollo.

01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:14.360
He's really sorry about it.

01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:17.200
He wanted to give the diamond back
to the rightful owner.

01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:21.234
I just wanted to make some money
so I could buy a hot-air balloon

01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:24.034
and fly home to Kelly Town
as a hot-air balloon captain.

01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:26.117
That is my biggest wish.

01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:27.993
You don't say?

01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:32.797
But first we should teach that Rapollo
and the other two crooks a lesson.

01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:35.799
Yeah! And I know exactly how to do that.

01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:37.434
- Wha...?
- Hm.

01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:41.438
Now, keep your eyes peeled
for those kids.

Yeah. It's us tricking you,
not the other way around.

01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:33.270
There's no doubt about it.
We're real sly tricksters us three, eh?

01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:38.236
Funny how you fell for all
my tall tales. How dumb can you be?

But now the diamond is finally mine.

01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:17.750
(CHUCKLES)

01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:19.519
Oh. Whoa!

01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:26.198
The time has come for you kids
or my name is not Rapollo.

01:08:26.319 --> 01:08:29.358
- (DOG BARKS)
- Yee-ha!

01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:32.911
(SCREAMS)

01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:37.000
Gnalle, Tubbe, get this mutt off of me!

01:08:37.120 --> 01:08:40.033
- Coming!
- (GRUNTS)

01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:43.319
Whoa!

01:08:43.439 --> 01:08:45.033
(THEY GROAN)

01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:48.113
Good boy!

01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:52.995
(WHISTLES)

01:09:02.359 --> 01:09:03.589
Oh, no! No!

01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:05.518
Wait! You got the wrong guy!

01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:07.154
Long live Leopoldus.

01:09:07.279 --> 01:09:08.999
Long live the police.

01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:12.352
And long live the clever little kids!

01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:15.395
Put me down! I'm getting seasick!

01:09:16.479 --> 01:09:18.312
I'm getting seasick!

01:09:23.319 --> 01:09:25.152
Oh, please, let us down.

01:09:25.279 --> 01:09:28.352
Don't worry.
It's a special place for you guys.

01:09:28.479 --> 01:09:31.439
(THEY GROAN)

01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:33.196
Whoa!

01:09:37.479 --> 01:09:41.189
RAPOLLO: You two nitwits!
You're gonna regret this!

01:09:41.319 --> 01:09:44.711
PARROT: Nitwits! Nitwits!
You're gonna regret this!

01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:47.071

(ALBERT GASPS)

01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:52.511
There's something
I want to ask you, Albert.

01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:56.520
Would you been interested
in an almost-new hot-air balloon?

01:09:56.640 --> 01:09:58.154
Sure would!

01:09:58.280 --> 01:10:01.830
You see, I have dreamt
about becoming more grounded,

01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:04.555
so I can spend more time with my girls.

01:10:04.680 --> 01:10:07.036
And I'll teach you how to fly.

01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:08.719
Do you really mean it?

01:10:08.840 --> 01:10:13.073
You'll make the perfect new
hot-air balloon captain of Kelly Town.

01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:17.592
Yippee! I can't believe that someone
would give a hot-air balloon away.

01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:19.393
I definitely didn't count on that.

01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:22.194
No. It's not something
that happens every day

01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:25.119
and it comes with a pirate's spyglass.

01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:28.950
Egon, would you like to be
the pirate captain of my ship?

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.435
Yeah, I'd like that very much.

01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:35.917
- Then we have a deal.
- ALBERT: Thank you so much!

01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:40.910
Albert, I think that a hot-air balloon
is perfect for a modern pirate.

01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:43.040
Haha.

01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:47.319
- We could use a fairground princess.
- Wanna come with us, Jumilla?

01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:48.999
Why, thank you.

01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:52.875
I'm flattered to be asked by boys
who normally hate girls.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.834
We don't hate fairground girls,
right, Egon?

01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:59.431
But I really have to stay here and help
my grandma and my grandpa.

01:10:59.560 --> 01:11:01.756
- Aw.
- But that's alright.

01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:05.191
Now that you have a hot-air balloon,
you can just come visit me.

01:11:05.320 --> 01:11:06.879
You're right!

01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:18.959
TAHIRA: Fly high, fellas!

01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:22.960
Remember to go <i>over</i> the mountain tops!

01:11:23.080 --> 01:11:26.790
- Watch out for the pointy bits!
- Don't forget to visit me!

01:11:26.920 --> 01:11:28.718
BOTH: You can count on that!

01:11:30.840 --> 01:11:33.958
You know what? Jumilla would make
a great balloon pirate.

01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:38.074
Yeah. Maybe not all girls are annoying.
What do you think?

01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:42.319
(CHUCKLES) It will be so nice
to get back to Kelly Town.

01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:46.514
ALBERT: Yeah, I'd love
some of my mom's pancakes. Wouldn't you?

01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:48.677
EGON: Yeah, with some pears.

01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:53.753
JUMILLA: Someone's a bit nosy,
right, Grandma?

01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:58.477
TAHIRA: I see into the future, darn it.
It is my job, girlfriend.

01:11:58.600 --> 01:12:02.514
JUMILLA: <i>Hey, look! Albert's mom
and dad and Egon's parents.</i>

01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:04.632
<i>They're all happy again.</i>

01:12:08.560 --> 01:12:12.395
<i>Look! Everybody gets
to go in the hot-air balloon.</i>

01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:17.670
Huh?

01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:21.760
TAHIRA: <i>Look at those high flyers.
My goodness!</i>

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:27.870
JUMILLA: <i>Whoa! Look at that big bully!
He looks like he's gonna hit Albert.</i>

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:32.472
TAHIRA: <i>Oh, no, no. He is just kidding.
There they go!</i>

01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:34.671
<i>Off on an adventure!</i>

01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:36.598
<i>It's hungry work!</i>

01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:38.916
