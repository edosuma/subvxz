WEBVTT

00:02.682 --> 00:03.682
<i>Previously on Battlestar Galactica. </i>

00:36.683 --> 00:37.877
Doral!

00:43.490 --> 00:46.926
When this body dies, my consciousness
will be transferred to another one.

00:47.060 --> 00:51.156
The Cylons have the ability to mimic
human form. They look like us now.

00:51.231 --> 00:54.359
This man has been identified
as a Cylon agent.

00:54.767 --> 00:58.134
You sleep, I watch. No.
You're the one who needs sleep.

01:00.073 --> 01:02.769
You are lucky that you didn't
lapse into a coma.

01:02.842 --> 01:07.302
The time is going to come when you won't
be able to hide what you're going through.

02:39.105 --> 02:40.265
Laura.

02:59.425 --> 03:00.551
Yes.

03:01.261 --> 03:03.991
Madam President, are you
okay in there?

03:05.531 --> 03:10.332
I'm fine, it's the side
effects from the Chamalla.

03:11.237 --> 03:15.333
You know that thing they say, "What's
worse? The cancer or the cure?"

03:15.441 --> 03:16.499
What do you need?

03:16.576 --> 03:20.569
<i>You have an urgent call from the
captain of the Gemenon Traveler.</i>

03:20.647 --> 03:24.447
Can I call him back? Says
he found a Cylon on board.

03:29.822 --> 03:30.880
They found him

03:30.957 --> 03:32.584
in the starboard
storage compartment.

03:32.659 --> 03:34.456
Looked like he'd been
camped here for days.

03:34.527 --> 03:36.552
<i>Are they sure it's a Cylon?</i>

03:37.297 --> 03:40.460
The captain identified him by
one of the photos we sent out.

03:40.533 --> 03:43.593
He's another copy of the man
you knew as Leoben Conroy.

03:45.071 --> 03:46.732
Where is it now?

03:47.340 --> 03:51.037
<i>Aboard the Gemenon Traveler,
locked in a storeroom under guard.</i>

03:52.645 --> 03:54.374
Isolate that ship.

03:54.781 --> 03:57.545
<i>Order the CAP to fly escort
around the Gemenon Traveler...</i>

03:57.617 --> 04:00.313
and not to approach
any other ship in the fleet.

04:00.386 --> 04:01.444
Aye, sir.

04:01.554 --> 04:03.249
<i>CAP, Galactica, fly close...</i>

04:03.323 --> 04:06.588
I'll send a team over
to destroy it immediately.

04:07.327 --> 04:09.192
I want this man
interrogated first.

04:09.262 --> 04:12.129
<i>First of all,
it's not a him, it's an it.</i>

04:12.598 --> 04:15.590
Second, anything it says
cannot be trusted.

04:15.802 --> 04:18.202
<i>Best thing to do is
to destroy it immediately.</i>

04:18.271 --> 04:21.570
I'd like to hear what this thing
has to say. It might be important.

04:21.641 --> 04:25.270
Madam President, I've dealt
with this model before.

04:25.845 --> 04:30.646
It will fill your head with doubletalk,
half-baked philosophy, and confuse you.

04:30.983 --> 04:33.247
Then send someone
who won't be easily confused.

04:33.319 --> 04:36.550
That's an order, Commander.
I want him interrogated.

04:37.290 --> 04:38.985
Order understood.

04:41.394 --> 04:44.454
You really think
it'll give us something?

04:44.530 --> 04:45.895
No.

04:48.534 --> 04:50.365
President disagrees.

04:52.672 --> 04:55.698
You need me to go,
I'll shower up and go.

04:57.577 --> 04:59.204
How's this coming?

04:59.312 --> 05:02.679
We got the entire
avionics package figured out.

05:02.749 --> 05:04.979
Fire control, navigation...

05:05.084 --> 05:08.281
and I think that I am
zeroing in on her FTL drive.

05:12.892 --> 05:15.952
I did this in a hurry
about three weeks ago.

05:16.729 --> 05:19.459
It's an after-action report
on Leoben.

05:19.999 --> 05:23.332
It's a very clever machine.
Manipulative, cunning.

05:24.270 --> 05:27.364
The only problem with Leoben
isn't that he lies.

05:27.440 --> 05:29.431
That would be too easy.

05:29.876 --> 05:32.436
It's that he mixes lies
with truth.

05:32.745 --> 05:36.203
Just remember, he's gonna try
to get into your head.

05:36.516 --> 05:39.713
Mom always said there was
nothing in there anyway.

05:41.754 --> 05:43.415
Just be careful.

05:43.990 --> 05:48.086
He has an agenda. It's a goal
you won't understand till later.

05:48.428 --> 05:51.625
Your job is to make sure
he doesn't achieve the goal.

05:51.731 --> 05:53.062
Yes, sir.

07:30.929 --> 07:32.328
Lieutenant.

07:36.835 --> 07:38.530
What's up?
Nothing.

07:40.171 --> 07:43.629
Just wanted to see if what I told
you the other day helped at all.

07:43.708 --> 07:45.835
Yeah. Actually, it did.

07:46.945 --> 07:49.971
You do treat this thing more
like an animal than a machine...

07:50.048 --> 07:52.608
and it actually works.

07:55.186 --> 07:59.179
Where did you come up with that
anyway? Just pop into your head?

08:02.427 --> 08:06.488
I'm a Cylon. You know,
that's not even funny.

08:07.999 --> 08:10.399
If I could prove
that I wasn't...

08:11.269 --> 08:14.534
would that make a difference?
You know, between us?

08:21.780 --> 08:24.146
<i>Gemenon Traveler, Raptor 719.</i>

08:24.215 --> 08:25.773
<i>We're inbound
with Lt. Thrace aboard.</i>

08:25.850 --> 08:27.511
<i>Permission to dock.</i>

08:27.585 --> 08:30.577
<i>Roger, 719.
Permission granted.</i>

08:33.158 --> 08:35.092
Really does look like a person.

08:35.160 --> 08:36.457
Yeah.

08:36.528 --> 08:38.826
Must be all
full of wires inside.

08:38.930 --> 08:42.559
No, you cut him open, there's
blood, guts, the whole thing.

08:42.867 --> 08:44.391
It's sweating.

08:49.340 --> 08:52.400
Well, I'll be...
Look at that.

08:54.879 --> 08:58.371
Gods, they go through a lot
of trouble to imitate people.

08:58.483 --> 09:01.714
Why do you think they do
that? I don't care why.

09:02.554 --> 09:05.250
But the fact that
these things sweat...

09:06.724 --> 09:08.715
now, that's interesting.

09:24.909 --> 09:26.240
Sleeping?

09:30.648 --> 09:31.945
Praying.

09:34.552 --> 09:37.885
I don't think the gods answer
the prayers of toasters.

09:39.224 --> 09:41.590
God answers
everyone's prayers.

09:42.427 --> 09:44.759
How many Cylons are there
in the fleet?

09:44.829 --> 09:47.161
We haven't been
properly introduced.

09:52.003 --> 09:53.436
I'm Leoben.

09:53.671 --> 09:57.437
How many Cylons are there
in the fleet? I have no idea.

09:59.010 --> 10:00.671
What's your name?

10:00.778 --> 10:02.939
How long have you been hiding
aboard this ship?

10:03.014 --> 10:04.948
Am I not allowed
to know your name?

10:05.016 --> 10:08.474
Why were you hiding aboard this
ship? I had a mission to perform.

10:08.553 --> 10:12.319
Listen, it's a small thing. Can
you just tell me who you are?

10:13.725 --> 10:16.319
Tell me about your mission
and I'll think about it.

10:16.394 --> 10:18.760
My mission was to
conduct sabotage.

10:18.830 --> 10:20.661
What kind of sabotage?

10:21.499 --> 10:23.057
God, you stink.

10:26.371 --> 10:29.169
Can I get some air in here?
Between you and the humidity...

10:29.240 --> 10:32.232
I am not here
to play games with you.

10:33.077 --> 10:37.537
You said you wanted to cooperate.
Either start talking, or we are done.

10:38.983 --> 10:40.143
Okay.

10:41.252 --> 10:45.484
But I really
wanna know your name.

10:50.261 --> 10:51.421
Open.

10:52.697 --> 10:54.562
Are you Lt. Starbuck?

10:58.903 --> 11:02.100
Yes, you are. I knew...

11:04.976 --> 11:06.307
I was right.

11:06.411 --> 11:09.437
I was right. I saw it.
I've seen it.

11:10.281 --> 11:11.578
Happy now?

11:11.649 --> 11:13.549
It all makes sense now.

11:14.452 --> 11:15.885
Doesn't it?

11:16.554 --> 11:20.012
Now we can talk. Now we can
talk about a lot of things.

11:24.662 --> 11:26.061
Like what?

11:27.832 --> 11:31.324
I planted a nuclear warhead
aboard one of your ships.

11:33.604 --> 11:36.596
It's set to go off
at 1830 hours.

11:40.511 --> 11:41.705
Where?

11:43.314 --> 11:44.941
I'm not ready to
give that up yet.

11:45.016 --> 11:47.075
You're lying.
There's no warhead.

11:47.151 --> 11:49.585
You can't take the chance,
Starbuck.

11:49.654 --> 11:54.455
Your military training dictates you take
it to your masters and let them decide.

11:55.126 --> 11:57.560
Maybe my training
wasn't so good.

11:59.230 --> 12:03.724
Maybe I push you out the airlock
and tell them you never said a word.

12:05.336 --> 12:06.598
Now who's lying?

12:06.671 --> 12:09.139
These things happen
for a reason, don't they?

12:09.207 --> 12:11.675
I'm looking forward to spending
a little more time with you.

12:11.743 --> 12:13.904
We have a lot to talk about.

12:14.946 --> 12:16.470
It's gonna be fun.

12:20.385 --> 12:23.047
Put the Red Team
on alert immediately. Dee?

12:23.121 --> 12:26.215
<i>And sweep Galactica for any
kind of radiological devices.</i>

12:26.290 --> 12:27.484
Right.

12:28.659 --> 12:30.854
Contact all the captains
in the fleet.

12:30.928 --> 12:33.362
Have them do radiological
sweeps of their ships.

12:33.431 --> 12:35.991
But emphasize that this is
just a precaution.

12:36.067 --> 12:38.592
I don't wanna alarm anyone
until we know for sure.

12:38.669 --> 12:40.000
Yes, sir.

12:40.605 --> 12:44.097
Well, we'll know for sure
in eight hours and 40 minutes.

12:44.175 --> 12:46.439
Lt. Thrace, did he say
anything else?

12:46.778 --> 12:47.904
No.

12:49.247 --> 12:51.613
He guessed my call sign.

12:52.517 --> 12:54.747
Seemed really happy
when he found out who I was.

12:54.819 --> 12:56.411
<i>He's playing with your mind.</i>

12:56.487 --> 12:59.513
He's been stowed away
for weeks aboard the fleet.

12:59.624 --> 13:03.390
<i>Fifty ways he could've heard the
word "Starbuck" on a wireless set.</i>

13:03.461 --> 13:05.258
That's what I figured, sir.

13:07.331 --> 13:08.992
Any idea what
he wants, Lieutenant?

13:09.067 --> 13:10.295
Not yet.

13:10.368 --> 13:13.166
Says he's looking forward to
spending time with me, though.

13:13.237 --> 13:15.330
Don't take any chances,
Starbuck.

13:15.740 --> 13:17.071
Yes, sir.

13:21.679 --> 13:24.944
You believe in the gods, don't
you? Lords of Kobol, and all that?

13:25.015 --> 13:26.915
Why should I tell you?

13:27.351 --> 13:30.479
It's not a trick question. I just
want to see how much I got right.

13:30.554 --> 13:33.079
So you pray to Artemis
and Aphrodite?

13:33.591 --> 13:35.422
Where's the warhead?

13:37.361 --> 13:38.794
I was right.

13:39.663 --> 13:42.632
See, our faiths are similar, but
I look to one god, not to many.

13:42.700 --> 13:44.827
I don't give a damn
what you believe.

13:44.902 --> 13:48.303
To know the face of God
is to know madness.

13:52.409 --> 13:54.877
I see the universe.

13:56.080 --> 13:58.071
I see the patterns.

13:58.949 --> 14:03.079
I see the foreshadowing that
precedes every moment of every day.

14:03.454 --> 14:06.753
It's all there. I see it.
And you don't.

14:07.625 --> 14:09.923
And I have a surprise for you.

14:09.994 --> 14:12.827
I have something to tell you
about the future.

14:13.263 --> 14:14.628
Is that so?

14:16.066 --> 14:19.729
It is. But we have to see this
through to the end.

14:41.792 --> 14:44.659
What is the most basic article
of faith?

14:45.462 --> 14:47.692
This is not all that we are.

14:50.467 --> 14:54.164
The difference between you and me is,
I know what that means and you don't.

14:54.238 --> 14:57.469
I know that I'm more than this
body, more than this consciousness.

14:57.541 --> 14:59.168
A part of me swims
in the stream.

14:59.243 --> 15:02.644
But in truth, I'm standing on the shore.
The current never takes me downstream.

15:04.548 --> 15:08.416
<i>This is worse than Galactica, and
I didn't think that was possible.</i>

15:09.687 --> 15:12.850
And what was that "swimming
in streams" or something?

15:14.892 --> 15:16.359
Do you mind?

15:22.800 --> 15:24.199
Thank you.

15:27.805 --> 15:30.103
Starving. Haven't eaten
in days.

15:30.307 --> 15:34.266
Kind of bad programming, isn't
it? I mean, why bother with hunger?

15:35.379 --> 15:37.142
Part of being human.

15:37.481 --> 15:39.142
You're not human.

15:41.685 --> 15:43.277
How's your lunch?

15:44.588 --> 15:46.351
You know how it is.

15:47.958 --> 15:50.950
When you're starving,
anything tastes good.

16:05.008 --> 16:06.532
Did that hurt?

16:08.879 --> 16:10.540
Yeah, that hurt.

16:12.883 --> 16:15.181
Machines
shouldn't feel pain...

16:15.652 --> 16:17.381
shouldn't bleed...

16:18.055 --> 16:19.716
shouldn't sweat.

16:21.725 --> 16:24.216
Sweat. That's funny.
That's good.

16:25.829 --> 16:29.788
See, a smart Cylon would turn off
the old pain software about now.

16:29.867 --> 16:32.267
But I don't think
you're so smart.

16:32.369 --> 16:35.532
Maybe I'll turn it off
and you won't even know.

16:40.778 --> 16:42.541
Here's your dilemma.

16:42.613 --> 16:44.046
Turn off the pain,
you feel better,

16:44.114 --> 16:46.947
but that makes you
a machine, not a person.

16:47.050 --> 16:50.281
You see, human beings
can't turn off their pain.

16:52.189 --> 16:54.419
Human beings have to suffer...

16:54.525 --> 16:58.461
and cry, and scream,
and endure...

16:59.062 --> 17:00.586
because they have no choice.

17:00.664 --> 17:03.497
So the only way you can avoid the
pain you're about to receive...

17:03.567 --> 17:06.331
is by telling me
exactly what I wanna know.

17:06.403 --> 17:08.200
Just like a human would.

17:11.241 --> 17:13.038
I knew this about you.

17:14.578 --> 17:17.308
You're everything
I thought you would be.

17:17.614 --> 17:20.640
But it won't work.
I won't tell you anything.

17:20.751 --> 17:22.116
Maybe not.

17:23.086 --> 17:26.180
But then, you'll know
deep down that I beat you...

17:26.824 --> 17:29.054
that a human being beat you...

17:29.593 --> 17:32.687
and that you are truly
no greater than we are.

17:32.796 --> 17:35.526
You're just a bunch
of machines after all.

17:39.102 --> 17:40.831
Let the games begin.

18:02.526 --> 18:05.086
Well, look what the cat
dragged in.

18:06.096 --> 18:07.563
Lt. Valerii.

18:09.566 --> 18:11.659
It's an unexpected visit.

18:12.736 --> 18:14.533
You look wonderful.

18:21.178 --> 18:24.011
I need your help.
Anything I can do.

18:25.883 --> 18:27.475
Anything at all.

18:27.584 --> 18:29.575
Wonder why they call her
"Boomer"?

18:29.653 --> 18:31.814
I heard you were working
on a test...

18:31.889 --> 18:34.824
to tell the difference
between Cylons and humans.

18:34.892 --> 18:36.052
Bingo.

18:36.126 --> 18:39.095
I can't really talk about that
at the moment.

18:39.162 --> 18:42.325
You wouldn't help settle
a bet for me, would you?

18:43.133 --> 18:46.500
Why do they
call you "Boomer"?

18:47.971 --> 18:50.405
If you're working
on a Cylon detector...

18:50.474 --> 18:53.068
do you think I could be
in the first batch?

18:53.143 --> 18:54.508
You know, to be tested?

18:54.578 --> 18:57.138
What's her rush?
What's your rush?

18:58.548 --> 19:01.278
I'm not sure it would be
appropriate to show favoritism.

19:01.351 --> 19:03.842
If, indeed, I am working
on anything at all.

19:03.921 --> 19:05.684
I saved your life
back on Caprica.

19:05.756 --> 19:10.591
<i>My co-pilot gave up his seat for you I
brought you back to Galactica, to safety.</i>

19:10.961 --> 19:14.727
You wouldn't even be here if
it wasn't for me. You owe me.

19:17.334 --> 19:20.360
She shoots. She scores.

19:22.973 --> 19:25.806
I suppose there's
some small truth to that.

19:27.911 --> 19:30.004
So, can you test me or not?

19:30.147 --> 19:32.138
I think you should do it.

19:32.549 --> 19:35.916
Results will be
quite intriguing.

19:36.586 --> 19:40.249
The technology
for Cylon detection...

19:41.825 --> 19:44.988
is not quite ready
for full-scale implementation.

19:49.032 --> 19:51.364
But I could use
a beta test subject.

20:09.987 --> 20:11.477
Sharon's late.

20:12.089 --> 20:13.579
Half an hour.

20:15.625 --> 20:18.321
I notice you're calling her
Sharon now.

20:18.528 --> 20:20.962
Yeah, I choose to think of her
as one of them.

20:21.031 --> 20:22.965
Because you dislike her?

20:24.868 --> 20:27.359
Because in the scheme of
things, we are as we do.

20:27.437 --> 20:30.304
She acts like one of them,
thinks like them.

20:31.308 --> 20:32.832
She is one of them.

20:32.909 --> 20:36.777
But she's one of us. It would
be best to remember that.

20:44.855 --> 20:47.085
We had sex.
Congratulations.

20:48.125 --> 20:50.184
Does he love you? I think so.

20:50.260 --> 20:52.592
Has he said it?
Not directly.

20:54.264 --> 20:55.561
Then you're just guessing.

20:55.632 --> 20:57.623
Stay in
your current location.

20:57.701 --> 20:59.601
We're setting up
a cabin for you nearby.

20:59.669 --> 21:01.762
Food, water, electricity.
All the comforts.

21:01.838 --> 21:05.365
Shouldn't be too hard to convince
him to stay and start a life together.

21:05.442 --> 21:07.137
If not, kill him.

21:07.978 --> 21:09.741
Can you handle that?

21:24.261 --> 21:26.627
We made it this far, we're
gonna make it all the way.

21:26.696 --> 21:29.631
If something happened to you, I
wouldn't know how to deal with it.

21:29.699 --> 21:30.688
Caprica!

21:34.604 --> 21:36.196
<i>If he flees, he dies.</i>

21:38.175 --> 21:39.665
<i>Does he love you?</i>

21:42.279 --> 21:43.439
Helo.

21:46.249 --> 21:49.275
Hey, what's going on?
Come on. We gotta go. Now.

21:49.352 --> 21:51.286
I saw Cylons.
They're headed this way.

21:51.354 --> 21:53.515
We got to travel fast,
even faster than before.

21:53.590 --> 21:56.821
Why? What's different?
Everything. Just trust me.

21:57.794 --> 21:58.954
I do.

22:06.303 --> 22:08.032
Now, if you were human...

22:08.105 --> 22:12.007
you'd be just about ready to start
offering up some false information...

22:12.075 --> 22:13.940
about the location
of the nuke.

22:14.010 --> 22:15.944
Some tiny thing that might
get you a reward...

22:16.012 --> 22:18.344
and maybe spare you
a few minutes of this.

22:18.415 --> 22:21.316
But then, I keep forgetting
you're not human.

22:24.754 --> 22:26.449
You're a machine.

22:27.691 --> 22:29.158
I am more...

22:29.926 --> 22:32.793
than you could ever imagine.

22:35.132 --> 22:36.463
I am God.

22:38.635 --> 22:40.535
I'm sorry. You're God?

22:43.540 --> 22:45.667
Wow. Nice to meet you.

22:46.243 --> 22:49.007
That's good. We'll give you
a couple of minutes with that.

22:50.180 --> 22:53.081
It's funny, isn't it?

22:55.085 --> 22:57.519
We're all God, Starbuck.
All of us.

22:57.587 --> 23:00.283
I see the love that binds
all living things together.

23:00.357 --> 23:01.517
Love?

23:02.159 --> 23:04.320
You don't even know
what the word means.

23:04.394 --> 23:08.353
I know that God loved you more
than all other living creatures...

23:08.431 --> 23:11.992
and you repaid his divine love
with sin...

23:12.068 --> 23:16.198
with hate, corruption, evil.

23:16.540 --> 23:18.667
So then he decided
to create the Cylons.

23:18.742 --> 23:23.111
The gods had nothing to do
with it. We created you. Us.

23:23.380 --> 23:27.043
It was a stupid, fracked-up
decision, and we have paid for it.

23:27.117 --> 23:30.416
You slaughtered
my entire civilization.

23:30.487 --> 23:34.583
That is sin. That is evil.
And you are evil.

23:37.661 --> 23:38.821
Am I?

23:40.397 --> 23:43.662
I see the truths that float
past you in the stream.

23:46.503 --> 23:49.904
You have a real thing about
rivers and streams, don't you?

23:49.973 --> 23:53.067
I think we should indulge you
in your obsession.

24:05.222 --> 24:09.056
Do you realize I could kill you
before they came back in the room?

24:09.125 --> 24:10.888
I could get to my feet...

24:10.961 --> 24:13.452
rip your skull
from your spinal column...

24:13.530 --> 24:15.395
crash through that door...

24:15.465 --> 24:19.458
kill the guard in less time than it
has taken me to describe it to you.

24:20.070 --> 24:21.799
Then why don't you?

24:25.308 --> 24:27.003
It's not the time.

24:39.990 --> 24:41.423
He's loose!

24:44.527 --> 24:46.256
I have a surprise for you.

24:53.203 --> 24:55.034
You fracked up, pal.

24:57.774 --> 24:59.435
Now the gloves come off.

25:23.131 --> 25:24.621
Combat, Col. Tigh.

25:24.699 --> 25:26.326
<i>How's the search
going for the nuke?</i>

25:26.401 --> 25:28.198
Nothing so far.

25:28.303 --> 25:31.704
<i>How much time remaining?
Two hours, nine minutes.</i>

25:42.984 --> 25:44.315
Spread out the fleet.

25:44.386 --> 25:47.514
<i>No ship more than 500 clicks
from any other ship.</i>

25:47.589 --> 25:51.184
<i>If there's a nuke, let's
limit the damage. Aye, sir.</i>

26:05.607 --> 26:06.699
No.

26:31.900 --> 26:33.094
Do it.

26:39.274 --> 26:40.639
Leave him.

26:46.648 --> 26:47.774
Sir?

26:53.455 --> 26:55.218
Tell me
where the warhead is...

26:55.290 --> 26:57.622
otherwise you're gonna drown
in that bucket.

26:57.692 --> 27:00.627
I can't drown. I can't die.

27:01.897 --> 27:03.023
Right.

27:03.131 --> 27:05.656
Cmdr. Adama mentioned
that how if your body dies...

27:05.734 --> 27:08.760
your consciousness is downloaded
or transferred into another body.

27:08.837 --> 27:09.826
Something like that?

27:09.905 --> 27:11.304
No, exactly like that.

27:11.373 --> 27:13.739
But, you see,
I've been thinking.

27:14.009 --> 27:16.671
Why is a Cylon willing
to talk at all?

27:16.778 --> 27:18.575
Why does he care
if we destroy his body?

27:18.647 --> 27:23.277
Won't he just transfer away and laugh
at all of us and our stupid human ideas?

27:35.230 --> 27:37.425
Tell me where the warhead is.

27:38.900 --> 27:43.030
This is not your path, Starbuck.
You have a different destiny.

27:43.104 --> 27:44.833
Don't interrupt me.

27:45.040 --> 27:48.498
You see, I'm gonna dazzle you
with my poor human brain.

27:49.044 --> 27:51.638
You see, I think
that you're afraid.

27:52.247 --> 27:54.681
You're afraid that
we're a long way from home.

27:54.749 --> 27:57.309
What if you don't transfer
all the way back?

27:57.385 --> 28:00.320
What if when you die here,
you really die?

28:01.389 --> 28:04.620
It's your chance to find out
if you're really God...

28:04.726 --> 28:07.422
or just a bunch of circuits
with a bad haircut.

28:07.495 --> 28:09.224
I'm not afraid of dying.

28:09.297 --> 28:12.061
Someone's programmed you
with a fairytale of God...

28:12.133 --> 28:14.124
and streams,
and life ever after.

28:14.202 --> 28:16.830
But somewhere in that hard
drive that you call a brain...

28:16.905 --> 28:18.133
is a beeping message:

28:18.206 --> 28:21.334
"Error, error.
Does not compute.

28:22.310 --> 28:25.939
"I don't have a soul.
I have software.

28:27.048 --> 28:30.142
If I die, I'm gone. "

28:48.370 --> 28:49.894
I have a soul.

28:50.839 --> 28:52.329
I see patterns.

28:52.607 --> 28:54.040
I know you.

28:54.109 --> 28:55.542
You're damaged.

28:55.610 --> 28:57.339
You were born to a woman...

28:57.412 --> 29:01.906
who believed that suffering was
good for the soul, so you suffered.

29:02.951 --> 29:05.715
Your life is
a testament to pain.

29:06.287 --> 29:08.619
Injuries. Accidents.

29:09.057 --> 29:13.357
Some inflicted upon others,
others inflicted upon yourself.

29:14.195 --> 29:15.560
It surrounds you
like a bubble.

29:15.630 --> 29:18.622
But it's not real,
it's just...

29:19.300 --> 29:22.235
It's just something
she put in your head.

29:23.038 --> 29:26.303
It's something that you wanna
believe because it means...

29:26.941 --> 29:30.433
you're the problem, not
the world that you live in.

29:30.545 --> 29:34.982
You wanna believe it because
it means that you're bad luck.

29:35.750 --> 29:38.776
You're like a cancer
that needs to be removed.

29:38.853 --> 29:41.481
Because you hear her voice
every day...

29:42.891 --> 29:45.052
and you want her to be right.

29:49.097 --> 29:50.530
Start again.

30:13.655 --> 30:15.418
Now, we just
pop this in the slot...

30:15.490 --> 30:16.684
and wait for the results.

30:19.260 --> 30:21.854
Green, you're
a normal human being.

30:21.930 --> 30:24.490
Red, you're an evil Cylon.

30:29.437 --> 30:31.462
Should take
a couple of minutes.

30:33.108 --> 30:37.272
So tell me,
are you from Aerilon?

30:37.612 --> 30:39.944
There's a slight trace
of an accent there.

30:40.014 --> 30:43.575
What? No. Troy.
Troy.

30:45.086 --> 30:47.850
Troy. Tell me,
why is that familiar?

30:48.223 --> 30:49.952
Mining settlement.

30:51.059 --> 30:52.526
The accident.

30:52.594 --> 30:55.529
The explosion. Right.

30:57.065 --> 30:58.623
That was tragic.

31:00.168 --> 31:03.103
Your family...
They died with the rest.

31:04.339 --> 31:05.931
I'm very sorry.

31:11.079 --> 31:12.478
It's a lie.

31:15.917 --> 31:20.320
Congratulations, Doctor. You've
just uncovered your very first Cylon.

31:22.824 --> 31:26.658
Now, here's an interesting moment
in the life of Gaius Baltar.

31:27.662 --> 31:29.323
What will he do?

31:33.801 --> 31:36.463
Is everything okay?
Yeah.

31:37.205 --> 31:39.639
I'm just
interpolating the results.

31:39.707 --> 31:43.108
The question is, what will
she do if you expose her?

31:43.178 --> 31:44.805
Thank you or kill you?

31:44.879 --> 31:46.710
I thought it was just green
or red.

31:46.781 --> 31:49.875
Well, it's a little more
complicated than that.

31:50.185 --> 31:52.312
She probably doesn't know.

31:52.387 --> 31:55.083
She probably thinks she's just
another little girl from Troy...

31:55.156 --> 31:58.455
whose entire background vanished
in a mysterious accident.

31:58.526 --> 32:00.653
Should be interesting to see
how she responds...

32:00.728 --> 32:02.628
when you tell her the truth.

32:04.899 --> 32:07.663
I'm guessing her Cylon side will
take over and break your neck...

32:07.735 --> 32:09.828
before you can
give away her secret.

32:09.904 --> 32:11.496
Let's find out.

32:14.642 --> 32:16.701
Congratulations, it's green!

32:17.312 --> 32:19.303
It's very bright green.

32:20.014 --> 32:21.743
You're not a Cylon.
Really?

32:21.816 --> 32:25.445
100% human,
and very bright green as well.

32:26.721 --> 32:29.451
For a second, I was worried
what you were gonna say.

32:29.524 --> 32:30.855
Were you?
Yeah.

32:30.925 --> 32:33.826
Well, there's nothing
to be worried about anymore.

32:34.295 --> 32:37.355
You couldn't be more human
if you tried.

32:37.599 --> 32:40.534
Well, thanks.
Anytime.

32:50.678 --> 32:52.077
I have something
to tell you.

32:58.453 --> 33:01.251
How long before this
supposed bomb goes off?

33:01.856 --> 33:02.982
Less than an hour.

33:03.057 --> 33:05.855
<i>I want you to get me a shuttle.
I'm going to the Gemenon Traveler.</i>

33:05.927 --> 33:07.952
I want to see
the Cylon myself.

33:08.029 --> 33:11.021
Madam President, you need
to... Don't even start.

33:11.099 --> 33:14.068
I don't wanna discuss this.
I've made my decision.

33:14.135 --> 33:16.626
Not until I get you
a security detail.

33:25.680 --> 33:27.648
Enough. For frack's sake,
let him breathe.

33:53.374 --> 33:54.807
You're really sick.

33:56.277 --> 34:00.373
You're not a person. You're a
machine that's enjoying its own pain.

34:00.615 --> 34:02.913
All this has happened before.

34:03.518 --> 34:05.918
And all of it
will happen again.

34:07.121 --> 34:09.055
Don't quote scripture.

34:09.757 --> 34:12.123
You don't have the right
to use those words.

34:12.193 --> 34:15.390
You kneel before idols
and ask for guidance.

34:15.463 --> 34:18.557
But you can't see that your
destiny's already been written.

34:18.633 --> 34:22.592
Each of us plays a role.
Each time, a different role.

34:24.205 --> 34:28.232
Maybe the last time, I was the
interrogator and you were the prisoner.

34:30.011 --> 34:33.003
The players change,
the story remains the same.

34:33.114 --> 34:34.775
And this time...

34:35.450 --> 34:36.917
This time...

34:37.318 --> 34:41.778
your role is to
deliver my soul unto God.

34:43.024 --> 34:44.514
Do it for me.

34:44.625 --> 34:47.458
It's your destiny, and mine.

34:49.664 --> 34:53.532
And I told you I had a
surprise for you. Are you ready?

34:55.503 --> 34:57.528
You're gonna find Kobol.

34:59.107 --> 35:03.134
Birthplace of us all.
Kobol will lead you to Earth.

35:05.046 --> 35:07.344
This is my gift to you,
Kara.

35:10.318 --> 35:12.548
What the hell is going on here?

35:28.735 --> 35:32.068
What exactly is it that
you are doing here?

35:32.539 --> 35:34.370
It's a machine, sir.

35:35.642 --> 35:38.042
There's no limit
to the tactics I can use.

35:38.111 --> 35:40.079
And where's the warhead?

35:40.547 --> 35:43.516
I don't know.
You don't know?

35:44.251 --> 35:47.846
You spent the last eight hours
torturing this man.

35:48.789 --> 35:50.279
This machine.

35:51.057 --> 35:52.615
Whatever it is.

35:53.260 --> 35:57.253
And you don't have a single piece
of information to show for it.

35:57.664 --> 35:59.825
He thinks he can
see the future.

35:59.900 --> 36:02.460
Says he knows our destiny,
our fate.

36:04.171 --> 36:08.403
He says we're gonna find Kobol, and
that it's gonna lead us to Earth.

36:11.812 --> 36:14.610
Clean him up.
There's not much time.

36:15.015 --> 36:16.346
Yes, sir.

36:39.072 --> 36:41.165
Do you know who I am? Yes.

36:44.044 --> 36:46.604
I apologize for
what you've been through.

36:47.881 --> 36:49.906
Take his restraints off.

36:52.519 --> 36:53.713
Do it.

37:06.199 --> 37:07.598
Thank you.

37:07.801 --> 37:09.325
I can do more.

37:11.404 --> 37:14.635
I can guarantee your safety.
I can order your release.

37:15.475 --> 37:16.874
We are running out of time.

37:16.943 --> 37:20.276
We have only four minutes left
until your bomb goes off.

37:22.449 --> 37:24.007
I've come here to tell you...

37:24.084 --> 37:27.713
that this conflict between our
peoples does not have to continue.

37:28.889 --> 37:33.155
It can stop right here with
us. We have to trust each other.

37:34.427 --> 37:35.758
Trust me.

37:39.766 --> 37:41.666
I think you know you can.

37:42.969 --> 37:45.961
Tell me what I need to know,
and you will live.

37:49.442 --> 37:52.969
The warhead doesn't exist.
I made it up.

37:54.981 --> 37:57.245
Lieutenant was right.
I was too far out.

37:57.317 --> 38:01.947
I didn't wanna die, so when I got caught,
I made up a story to buy some time.

38:03.023 --> 38:04.251
I see.

38:06.793 --> 38:08.761
Thank you
for the truth.

38:10.063 --> 38:13.499
Thank you, Madam President.

38:15.669 --> 38:18.433
Don't be too hard on Kara.
She was just doing her job.

38:18.505 --> 38:23.067
The military,
they teach you to...

38:24.544 --> 38:26.307
dehumanize people.

38:29.983 --> 38:32.247
I'll take that
into consideration.

38:33.520 --> 38:35.545
No! Stand down.

38:40.694 --> 38:43.891
Laura, I have something
to tell you.

38:46.533 --> 38:48.228
Adama is a Cylon.

38:53.340 --> 38:55.365
Yeah. Yeah.

39:15.395 --> 39:17.659
Are you all right?
I'm fine.

39:19.332 --> 39:22.165
The bomb?
Nothing.

39:26.106 --> 39:28.666
Put him out the airlock.
What?

39:30.043 --> 39:34.377
You can't do that. Not after he
told you... Yes, I can. And I will.

39:40.086 --> 39:41.951
Lieutenant, look at me.

39:43.690 --> 39:45.624
You've lost perspective.

39:45.692 --> 39:49.219
During the time I have allowed him to
remain alive and captive on this ship...

39:49.295 --> 39:52.822
he has caused our entire fleet
to spread out defenseless.

39:55.235 --> 39:58.204
He puts insidious ideas
in our minds.

39:58.805 --> 40:01.069
More lethal
than any warhead.

40:02.008 --> 40:03.669
He creates fear.

40:04.110 --> 40:06.635
But you're right.
He's a machine.

40:07.580 --> 40:10.208
And you don't keep
a deadly machine around.

40:10.283 --> 40:12.877
When it kills your people
and threatens your future...

40:12.952 --> 40:14.715
you get rid of it.

40:19.092 --> 40:21.083
He's not afraid to die.

40:25.365 --> 40:28.630
He's just afraid that his
soul won't make it to God.

41:58.291 --> 42:00.691
Lords of Kobol,
hear my prayer.

42:02.796 --> 42:06.061
I don't know
if he had a soul or not.

42:07.233 --> 42:09.599
But if he did,
take care of it.

42:21.514 --> 42:23.846
Hell of a risk you took today.

42:24.150 --> 42:26.084
Something I had to do.

42:26.186 --> 42:28.017
Care to tell me why?

42:28.154 --> 42:29.849
President Adar once said...

42:29.923 --> 42:32.357
that the interesting thing
about being a President...

42:32.425 --> 42:35.690
is that you don't have to
explain yourself to anyone.

42:47.974 --> 42:49.532
Something wrong?

42:51.511 --> 42:54.071
No. Nothing at all.
