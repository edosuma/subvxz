WYATT MORRIS.

03:11.359 --> 03:13.727
SNATCHED FROM HIS FATHER
ON A SUBWAY PLATFORM.

03:13.727 --> 03:15.663

ALL THE TRAINS ON THAT LINE

03:15.663 --> 03:17.731

THE FATHER IS DAVID MORRIS,

REAL ESTATE FAMILY.

03:24.838 --> 03:26.507
- THEY OWN HALF
THE WEST SIDE.

03:26.507 --> 03:28.409
ANY RANSOM DEMANDS YET?

03:28.409 --> 03:29.810
- IT'S A LITTLE EARLY
FOR THAT.

03:29.810 --> 03:32.946
- THIS NEIGHBORHOOD'S CHANGED.

03:32.946 --> 03:34.948
- WHERE'S THE MOTHER?
- WE'RE STILL LOOKING.

03:34.948 --> 03:37.518
MR. MORRIS THINKS SHE MIGHT BE
OUT FOR A RUN.

03:37.518 --> 03:39.353
THEY'RE DIVORCED.

03:39.353 --> 03:43.357

LIV, YOU WITH US?

04:10.751 --> 04:12.953
- THIS NEIGHBORHOOD.

04:12.953 --> 04:14.788
HECTOR RODRIGUEZ,
THE DOMINICAN KID...

04:14.788 --> 04:16.324
HE WAS THE EXACT SAME AGE.

04:16.324 --> 04:17.791
- MISSING BOY, '99.

04:17.791 --> 04:19.993
DAD LOST CUSTODY,
TOOK THE KID BACK TO THE D.R.

04:19.993 --> 04:21.629
- WE DON'T KNOW THAT.

04:21.629 --> 04:24.565
THE MOTHER NEVER SAW
HER SON AGAIN.

04:24.565 --> 04:27.568
- LIV...HEY.

04:27.568 --> 04:31.505
THIS KID'S MISSING NOW.

05:24.091 --> 05:25.359
- HEY, WE'VE GOT
THREE TRAINS STOPPED

05:25.359 --> 05:26.560
BETWEEN HERE
AND THE STADIUM,

05:26.560 --> 05:27.761
A HALF DOZEN BOTTLED UP
BEHIND THEM.

05:27.761 --> 05:29.062
- ANY SIGN OF THE BOY?
- NOT YET.

05:29.062 --> 05:30.364
WE'RE HOLDING PASSENGERS
ON THE PLATFORM

05:30.364 --> 05:31.665
FOR QUESTIONING.

05:31.665 --> 05:32.733
IF THEY DON'T MAKE IT
TO THE GAME,

05:32.733 --> 05:33.934
WE MIGHT HAVE A RIOT.

05:33.934 --> 05:35.102
- WELL, THAT'S TOO BAD

05:35.102 --> 05:36.770
BECAUSE NOBODY'S
GOING ANYWHERE.

05:36.770 --> 05:38.839
THAT KID COULD STILL BE
ON ANY ONE OF THESE TRAINS.

05:38.839 --> 05:42.376
SEARCH EVERY CAR,
TALK TO EVERY PASSENGER.

05:42.376 --> 05:43.844
- HEY, CAPTAIN,
THE FATHER WANTS TO GO UPTOWN

05:43.844 --> 05:45.379
AND JOIN THE SEARCH.

05:45.379 --> 05:47.080
- NO, YOU TALK TO HIM HERE.
BOTH OF YOU.

05:47.080 --> 05:49.049
AND WHATEVER WENT ON
BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU,

05:49.049 --> 05:50.784
GET OVER IT--
WE DON'T HAVE TIME.

05:50.784 --> 05:53.754
- DAVID! WHERE'S WYATT?

05:53.754 --> 05:55.022
WHAT DID YOU DO?
WHAT DID YOU DO?

05:55.022 --> 05:56.390
- WHOA, WHOA, MS. MORRIS.
MS. MORRIS.

05:56.390 --> 05:58.392
- WHERE IS HE?
WHAT DID YOU DO?

05:58.392 --> 06:00.628
- MS. MORRIS, LISTEN--
- MS. COLFAX--LAURIE.

06:00.628 --> 06:02.996
- OKAY.
- WHERE'S WYATT? WHAT HAPPENED?

06:02.996 --> 06:04.798
- WE'RE TRYING
TO FIGURE THAT OUT NOW.

06:04.798 --> 06:07.435
- SLOW DOWN.
SLOW DOWN, MR. MORRIS.

06:07.435 --> 06:09.537
SO THIS GUY TAPPED YOU
ON THE SHOULDER.

06:09.537 --> 06:10.871
CAN YOU DESCRIBE HIM?

06:10.871 --> 06:13.741
WHITE, BLACK, AGE?

06:13.741 --> 06:17.545
- WHITE, 40s.
CAP, GLASSES.

06:17.545 --> 06:18.846
I'M BAD AT FACES.

06:18.846 --> 06:20.748
- DAVID HAS VISITATION
ON SUNDAY?

06:20.748 --> 06:22.816
- HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THERE
AT 9:00.

06:22.816 --> 06:24.485
HE WAS HIS USUAL
TWO HOURS LATE.

06:24.485 --> 06:26.820
- AND HE ONLY SEES WYATT
ONE DAY A WEEK?

06:26.820 --> 06:30.491
DOES THAT MAKE DAVID UPSET?
- HE'S ALWAYS UPSET.

06:30.491 --> 06:32.526
EVERYTHING ABOUT HIM IS
A NEGOTIATION.

06:32.526 --> 06:33.994
- OKAY, SO, MS. COLFAX,

06:33.994 --> 06:35.996
YOUR HUSBAND'S FAMILY IS
VERY WEALTHY.

06:35.996 --> 06:38.732
HAVE YOU NOTICED
ANYONE SUSPICIOUS

06:38.732 --> 06:41.669
TRYING TO TALK TO WYATT,
OR FOLLOWING YOU?

06:41.669 --> 06:43.103
ANYTHING LIKE THAT?

06:43.103 --> 06:46.073
- NO.

06:46.073 --> 06:47.841
YOU THINK THIS IS
ABOUT RANSOM?

06:47.841 --> 06:51.044
WE'LL PAY.
WE'LL POST A REWARD.

06:51.044 --> 06:52.613
- OKAY, LET'S HOLD OFF
ON THAT.

06:52.613 --> 06:54.915
IT'S JUST GONNA BRING OUT
CON ARTISTS.

06:54.915 --> 06:56.717
SO IF SOMEBODY WANTS
TO GET IN TOUCH WITH YOU,

06:56.717 --> 06:57.851
I PROMISE YOU THEY WILL.

06:57.851 --> 07:00.120
- BUT WHAT IF NO ONE CALLS?

07:00.120 --> 07:02.422
- WELL, WE'LL CROSS THAT BRIDGE
WHEN WE GET TO IT.

07:06.594 --> 07:08.028
- [gasps] OH, GOD.
- HEY, LAURIE.

07:08.028 --> 07:09.897
LAURIE, I NEED YOU
TO STAY FOCUSED.

07:09.897 --> 07:12.866
I NEED YOU TO STAY FOCUSED.
WHOA, WHOA.

07:12.866 --> 07:14.635
- FIND MY SON.
- OKAY.

07:14.635 --> 07:16.203
WE'RE GONNA DO
THE BEST WE CAN.

07:16.203 --> 07:18.706
- FIND MY SON.
- OKAY.

07:18.706 --> 07:20.908
OKAY.
- FIND MY SON.

07:23.544 --> 07:25.245
- THIS IS A FULL-ON
AMBER ALERT.

07:25.245 --> 07:28.181
THESE GO UP IN EVERY STREET,
IN EVERY BOROUGH

07:28.181 --> 07:30.484
WITHIN THE HOUR.

07:30.484 --> 07:32.620
- TARU CAN'T TRACE
THE KID'S CELL PHONE.

07:32.620 --> 07:35.556
- SO ONE WITNESS SAW
A BLACK MAN

07:35.556 --> 07:36.924
PULL WYATT ONTO THE TRAIN.

07:36.924 --> 07:39.092
ANOTHER SAW
AN OLDER WHITE MALE.

07:39.092 --> 07:40.994
AND ONE PUT HIM
WITH A WOMAN.

07:40.994 --> 07:43.597
THERE WERE A LOT OF KIDS
IN CAPS ON THOSE TRAINS.

07:43.597 --> 07:45.065
- AND NO VIDEO
FROM THAT STATION.

07:45.065 --> 07:47.000
- WELL, 110TH STREET?

07:47.000 --> 07:48.902
THE HOI POLLOI DON'T GET
THOSE UPGRADES.

07:48.902 --> 07:50.137
- MORNINGSIDE HEIGHTS
HAS CHANGED.

07:50.137 --> 07:51.939
IT'S NOT LIKE IT WAS
IN '99.

07:51.939 --> 07:52.940
- YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT
HECTOR RODRIGUEZ.

07:52.940 --> 07:54.174
IT WAS A WAR ZONE THEN.

07:54.174 --> 07:55.909
- THERE HE GOES
WITH THE BAD OLD DAYS.

07:55.909 --> 07:58.045
- IT'S STILL MIXED.
I CAN'T BELIEVE MORRIS

07:58.045 --> 08:00.247
AND HIS FAMILY LIVE UP THERE.
- WELL, HE OWNS THE BUILDING.

08:00.247 --> 08:01.882
AND HE'S RENOVATED
HALF THE BLOCK,

08:01.882 --> 08:03.283
AND IT'S HIS EX-WIFE.

08:03.283 --> 08:04.852
- ARE THEY STILL IN COURT?

08:04.852 --> 08:06.887
- ON A CUSTODY ISSUE,
EVERY THREE MONTHS.

08:06.887 --> 08:08.255
- MAYBE DAVID MORRIS
GOT TIRED OF PAYING

08:08.255 --> 08:10.591
FOR TWO SETS
OF LEGAL FEES.

08:10.591 --> 08:12.192
- AND HAS HIS OWN SON
KIDNAPPED?

08:12.192 --> 08:14.728
- OR THE WIFE WANTS
TO MAKE HIM LOOK BAD.

08:14.728 --> 08:16.029
- NOTHING'S FAIR
IN LOVE AND WAR.

08:16.029 --> 08:17.598
- SHE DOES WANT TO MAKE HIM
LOOK BAD.

08:17.598 --> 08:19.032
SHE MADE A POINT
OF TELLING ME

08:19.032 --> 08:21.869
THAT HE GOT THERE
AT 11:00 TODAY, TWO HOURS LATE.

08:21.869 --> 08:23.203
- 11:00?

08:23.203 --> 08:24.972
THE TRAIN DIDN'T LEAVE
UNTIL 12:15.

08:24.972 --> 08:26.840
- DID DAVID TELL YOU
HE STOPPED ANYWHERE?

08:26.840 --> 08:29.276
- NO. AND I ASKED.

08:29.276 --> 08:30.811
- WELL, I DIDN'T TELL YOU

08:30.811 --> 08:31.812
BECAUSE I DIDN'T THINK
IT MATTERED.

08:31.812 --> 08:33.213
WE WENT TO A PASTRY SHOP.

08:33.213 --> 08:34.314
- AND YOU DIDN'T WANT
YOUR WIFE TO KNOW

08:34.314 --> 08:36.183
YOU WERE GIVING HIM SWEETS?

08:36.183 --> 08:38.085
- I JUST WANTED WYATT
TO HAVE A FUN DAY.

08:38.085 --> 08:40.153
THE DIVORCE HAS BEEN
REALLY HARD ON HIM.

08:40.153 --> 08:43.924
- CAN ANYONE CONFIRM THAT?

08:43.924 --> 08:45.893
- YEAH.
THE HOSTESS.

08:45.893 --> 08:48.195
I'VE BEEN SEEING HER.

08:48.195 --> 08:50.564
SHE ALSO USED TO BABYSIT
FOR WYATT.

08:53.266 --> 08:56.804
GUESS I DIDN'T WANT LAURIE
TO KNOW THAT EITHER.

08:59.006 --> 09:02.309
- THE MISSING BOY.
GOD, THAT'S HORRIBLE.

09:02.309 --> 09:04.244
YEAH, I THINK I SAW THEM.

09:04.244 --> 09:05.846
- YOU THINK? HONEY, WE KNOW
THAT YOU'RE INVOLVED

09:05.846 --> 09:07.280
WITH DAVID, OKAY?

09:07.280 --> 09:08.982
- DOES LAURIE KNOW?

09:08.982 --> 09:11.284
- THAT'S ON YOU.
WERE THEY HERE?

09:11.284 --> 09:13.787
- EATING MUFFINS.

09:13.787 --> 09:15.923
WYATT HAD MILK, SKIM.

09:15.923 --> 09:18.058
- YOU AND THE DAD EVER
GO ANYWHERE PRIVATE,

09:18.058 --> 09:19.793
MAYBE LEAVE THE BOY ALONE?

09:19.793 --> 09:21.094
- NO, NO.

09:21.094 --> 09:23.897
- DID YOU NOTICE ANYONE
LOOKING AT WYATT?

09:23.897 --> 09:27.768
LIKE, DARK SUNGLASSES,
OR A BASEBALL CAP?

09:27.768 --> 09:28.936
- THE PLACE IS FULL
OF DADS LIKE THAT.

09:28.936 --> 09:30.170
IT'S THE PLAYOFFS.

09:30.170 --> 09:31.972
- THIS GUY WOULD HAVE
BEEN BY HIMSELF.

09:31.972 --> 09:34.875
- WAIT, THERE WAS ONE.

09:34.875 --> 09:38.011
A SINGLETON.
HE ORDERED TEA IN A GLASS...

09:38.011 --> 09:41.782
GOT UP WHEN THEY DID
AND JUST LEFT $2.

09:41.782 --> 09:43.784
- GOT THIS FROM A BOUTIQUE
NEAR THE CAFE.

09:43.784 --> 09:46.386
- NOT ENOUGH OF AN IMAGE
FOR FACIAL RECOGNITION SOFTWARE.

09:46.386 --> 09:47.821
- ANY OTHER ANGLES?

09:47.821 --> 09:49.957
ANYTHING FROM TRAFFIC CAMS,
ATMs?

09:49.957 --> 09:51.692
- TARU'S STILL CHECKING.

09:51.692 --> 09:53.360
- WHAT ARE WE, THREE HOURS IN,
AND NO RANSOM DEMAND?

09:53.360 --> 09:56.029
THIS GUY'S A PREDATOR.
ARE YOU GETTING DEJA VU?

09:56.029 --> 09:58.365
- DON'T HAVE HER
START UP AGAIN.

09:58.365 --> 10:00.634
- IT'S THE SAME NEIGHBORHOOD.

10:00.634 --> 10:03.771
HECTOR DISAPPEARED ON A BUS,
WYATT ON A SUBWAY.

10:03.771 --> 10:06.339
- GUYS, IT'S 13 YEARS,
TWO DIFFERENT WORLDS.

10:06.339 --> 10:08.275
HECTOR WAS FROM
A WORKING-CLASS FAMILY.

10:08.275 --> 10:10.778
- YEAH, WHICH IS WHY WE HAD
ABOUT 1/10 OF THE RESOURCES

10:10.778 --> 10:12.345
TO FIND HIM.
- WAIT, BACK UP.

10:12.345 --> 10:14.648
YOU SAID HECTOR WAS TAKEN
OFF A BUS AND NEVER SEEN AGAIN?

10:14.648 --> 10:17.150
- A WITNESS THOUGHT THAT
SHE SAW HIM A FEW HOURS LATER

10:17.150 --> 10:18.852
WITH HIS HAIR DYED BLOND.

10:18.852 --> 10:20.353
- HIS FATHER CHANGED
THE BOY'S APPEARANCE

10:20.353 --> 10:21.421
TO GET HIM OUT OF THE COUNTRY.

10:21.421 --> 10:23.924
HECTOR'S CASE IS CLOSED.

10:23.924 --> 10:26.660
WE HAVE A LEAD ON WYATT.
FOLLOW IT UP.

10:26.660 --> 10:28.696
- THAT COULD BE HIM.

10:28.696 --> 10:31.431
I DIDN'T NOTICE ANYBODY
AT THE PASTRY SHOP, THOUGH.

10:31.431 --> 10:33.366
- DAVID, WYATT HAD BREAKFAST!
- OH, GOD.

10:33.366 --> 10:34.902
- WHAT WERE YOU DOING THERE?

10:34.902 --> 10:37.037
- LAURIE, WE THINK THAT
WHOEVER TOOK WYATT

10:37.037 --> 10:38.405
MAY HAVE FOLLOWED HIM.

10:38.405 --> 10:40.040
THEY KNEW YOUR FAMILY'S
ROUTINE.

10:40.040 --> 10:41.441
- I HAVEN'T SEEN ANYONE
WATCHING US,

10:41.441 --> 10:43.911
AND I'M WITH HIM
ALL THE TIME, EXCEPT FOR SCHOOL.

10:43.911 --> 10:45.345
AND SUNDAYS.

10:45.345 --> 10:47.881
- SUNDAY.
THAT'S YOUR DAY, RIGHT, DAVID?

10:47.881 --> 10:49.449
- YEAH.
I HAVEN'T NOTICED ANYBODY.

10:49.449 --> 10:52.185
- YOU WOULDN'T.

10:52.185 --> 10:53.787
HALF THE NEIGHBORHOOD'S
PISSED OFF AT HIM.

10:53.787 --> 10:55.455
HE'S CLUELESS.
- NO, THEY'RE NOT.

10:55.455 --> 10:57.758
- LAURIE, DAVID, WE NEED YOU
TO BE ON THE SAME SIDE NOW.

10:57.758 --> 11:00.360
- EASY. PISSED OFF ABOUT WHAT?
- THIS BUILDING.

11:00.360 --> 11:02.362
ALL HIS RENOVATIONS, CONDOS.

11:02.362 --> 11:04.264
WHEN HE GOES TO THOSE
COMMUNITY BOARD MEETINGS,

11:04.264 --> 11:05.899
THE WHOLE ROOM WANTS
TO KILL HIM.

11:05.899 --> 11:08.268
- COME ON! I MEAN, THIS IS
MORNINGSIDE HEIGHTS!

11:08.268 --> 11:10.871
YOU SHOULD SEE THESE PEOPLE.
IT'S LIKE THE '60s NEVER ENDED!

11:10.871 --> 11:13.473
- DAVID, LOOK AGAIN.
YOU EVER SEEN THIS GUY

11:13.473 --> 11:15.776
AT ONE OF THE COMMUNITY
BOARD MEETINGS?

11:15.776 --> 11:16.910
- I DON'T SEE ANYBODY
AT THOSE MEETINGS.

11:16.910 --> 11:18.912
I TUNE 'EM OUT.
[cell vibrating]

11:18.912 --> 11:20.748
- YOU TUNE OUT A ROOM
FULL OF PEOPLE

11:20.748 --> 11:22.883
WHO ARE ACCUSING YOU
OF PRICING THEM OUT

11:22.883 --> 11:24.284
OF THEIR OWN HOMES?

11:24.284 --> 11:25.452
- IF I LET THEM CONTROL
THE AGENDA,

11:25.452 --> 11:27.054
NOTHING GETS BUILT,
ALL RIGHT?

11:27.054 --> 11:28.756
THIS NEIGHBORHOOD,
IT WOULD STILL BE A SLUM.

11:28.756 --> 11:32.993
- LIV.
- WHAT IS IT?

11:32.993 --> 11:34.394
- WHEN ARE YOU
GOING TO LEAVE?

11:34.394 --> 11:36.129
YOU PEOPLE,
YOU'RE COSTING ME BUSINESS.

11:36.129 --> 11:38.198
- IT'S SIMPLE. A COUPLE SAID
THEY SAW THIS BOY

11:38.198 --> 11:39.199
COME OUT OF YOUR STORE.

11:39.199 --> 11:40.233
NOW, DID YOU SEE HIM?

11:40.233 --> 11:41.401
- THERE ARE A LOT OF KIDS

11:41.401 --> 11:42.870
THAT COME INTO MY STORE.

11:42.870 --> 11:45.773
I'M SORRY,
I CAN'T PLACE HIM.

11:45.773 --> 11:47.440
HOW MUCH LONGER ARE YOU GOING
TO BE OUT THERE?

11:47.440 --> 11:49.276
- YOU MIGHT WANT
TO THINK HARDER.

11:49.276 --> 11:52.279
JUST FOUND THE BOY'S CELL PHONE
OUTSIDE IN YOUR DUMPSTER.

11:52.279 --> 11:54.314
NOW, WE CAN
SHUT YOUR STORE DOWN ALL DAY

11:54.314 --> 11:55.415
AND GO THROUGH IT
WITH A FINE-TOOTH COMB.

11:55.415 --> 11:56.850
- YOU WANT TO TRY AGAIN?

11:56.850 --> 11:59.086
HE WOULD HAVE COME IN
WITH A MAN.

12:01.388 --> 12:03.824
- YES, I REMEMBER HIM.

12:03.824 --> 12:07.194
THE MAN HAD GLASSES
AND A CAP AND BLACK HAIR.

12:07.194 --> 12:09.496
- IS THIS HIM?

12:09.496 --> 12:11.031
- I CAN'T TELL FROM THAT.

12:11.031 --> 12:13.166
I REMEMBER, BECAUSE
WHEN HIS SON ACTED UP,

12:13.166 --> 12:16.269
HE BOUGHT HIM CANDY, AND THEN
HE BOUGHT SOME HAIR DYE.

12:16.269 --> 12:18.005
- HAIR DYE? WHAT COLOR?

12:18.005 --> 12:20.908
- UH...BLOND.

12:20.908 --> 12:22.509
- GET SOMEBODY
TO WATCH YOUR STORE.

12:22.509 --> 12:24.377
WE'RE GONNA NEED YOU
TO COME DOWN TO THE STATION

12:24.377 --> 12:27.414
AND MEET WITH A SKETCH ARTIST.

12:27.414 --> 12:30.183
- ARE WE LOOKING AT A COPYCAT
FROM THE HECTOR RODRIGUEZ CASE?

12:30.183 --> 12:32.953
- THE BLOND HAIR DYE WAS
NEVER RELEASED TO THE PRESS.

12:32.953 --> 12:35.422
- DON'T EVEN WASTE YOUR TIME
WITH "I TOLD YOU SO."

12:51.004 --> 12:53.073
- IT'S BEEN OVER A WEEK NOW,
AND STILL NO SIGN...

12:53.073 --> 12:55.508
- YOU STILL HERE?
- OF YOUNG HECTOR RODRIGUEZ.

12:55.508 --> 12:58.912
- YEAH.
- CAN YOU SLEEP?

12:58.912 --> 13:02.049
- I CLOSE MY EYES,
I SEE HECTOR'S FACE.

13:02.049 --> 13:06.153
- GO HOME, JOHN.

13:06.153 --> 13:09.489
- I GOT TWO MORE TAPES
TO WATCH.

13:09.489 --> 13:13.861
- JOHN?
YOU'RE STILL HERE?

13:13.861 --> 13:15.495
- NEVER LEFT.

13:15.495 --> 13:16.997
- ANY OTHER CASES
WHERE AN ABDUCTED KID

13:16.997 --> 13:18.365
HAD HIS HAIR DYED BLOND?

13:18.365 --> 13:20.100
- YEAH, I'VE CHECKED
THROUGH 15 YEARS,

13:20.100 --> 13:23.003
AND THE ONLY OTHER ONE
I FOUND WAS HECTOR RODRIGUEZ.

13:23.003 --> 13:24.437
- ALL RIGHT, LOOK,
HANG ON.

13:24.437 --> 13:27.374
I'M NOT READY TO START
CHASING GHOSTS JUST YET.

13:27.374 --> 13:29.176
WHERE ARE WE
ON SECURITY FOOTAGE

13:29.176 --> 13:31.144
NEAR THE CONVENIENCE STORE?

13:31.144 --> 13:32.980
- TARU JUST SENT THIS OVER.

13:32.980 --> 13:35.548
IT'S FROM THE OLD TUNNELS
BENEATH COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY.

13:37.918 --> 13:40.353
- WELL, HIS HAIR'S DYED BLOND.

13:40.353 --> 13:42.455
- THIS THE LAST SIGHTING?
- SO FAR.

13:42.455 --> 13:44.457
- WE'VE GOT NO LEADS
FROM THE TIP LINE.

13:44.457 --> 13:47.394
NOTHING FROM THE OTHER BOROUGHS,
THE FBI.

13:47.394 --> 13:49.829
- WE HAVE TO TAKE ANOTHER LOOK
AT HECTOR RODRIGUEZ.

14:07.915 --> 14:09.516
- HE'S RIGHT, CAPTAIN.

14:09.516 --> 14:11.351
WE COULD HAVE BEEN WRONG
13 YEARS AGO.

14:11.351 --> 14:13.486
- ALL RIGHT, LOOK,
COULD WE ALL JUST FOCUS HERE?

14:13.486 --> 14:15.488
- ANYONE IN TOUCH
WITH HECTOR'S FAMILY?

14:15.488 --> 14:17.991
- I'VE SPOKEN TO THE MOTHER
A FEW TIMES.

14:17.991 --> 14:19.259
SHE STILL LIVES
UP IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

14:19.259 --> 14:20.627
- I CAN GO UP THERE
WITH YOU, LIV.

14:20.627 --> 14:22.395
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
YOU STAY HERE.

14:22.395 --> 14:23.496
GO THROUGH THE FILES.

14:23.496 --> 14:25.565
TAKE AMARO.
FRESH EYES.

14:28.601 --> 14:30.237
- I'M GETTING THE SENSE
CRAGEN WANTS US

14:30.237 --> 14:32.505
PARTNERING UP AGAIN.

14:32.505 --> 14:35.909
- MAYBE HE JUST WANTS THINGS
THE WAY THEY WERE.

14:35.909 --> 14:38.511
YOU OKAY WITH THAT?

14:38.511 --> 14:43.283
- YEAH. I'VE GOT ENOUGH
SEPARATIONS IN MY LIFE.

14:43.283 --> 14:45.552
SO HECTOR RODRIGUEZ.

14:45.552 --> 14:48.588
YOU AND MUNCH WERE PARTNERS
ON THAT?

14:48.588 --> 14:51.591
- EVERYBODY ON THE SQUAD
JUMPED IN.

14:51.591 --> 14:53.493
I DIDN'T THINK THAT
HECTOR'S FATHER TOOK HIM,

14:53.493 --> 14:56.129
BUT I WAS A NEWBIE
BACK THEN,

14:56.129 --> 14:59.299
SO I GUESS I LET MYSELF
GET A LITTLE STAMPEDED.

14:59.299 --> 15:01.634
- HECTOR'S MOTHER--

15:01.634 --> 15:04.004
ALL THESE YEARS,
SHE NEVER MOVED?

15:04.004 --> 15:05.973
- SHE COULDN'T.

15:05.973 --> 15:11.611
SHE STILL THINKS THAT
HECTOR MIGHT COME HOME.

15:13.413 --> 15:15.248
- COME ON.

15:15.248 --> 15:19.052
- READ IT, PLEASE.
READ IT.

15:19.052 --> 15:24.224
- "MY NAME IS HECTOR RODRIGUEZ.
I AM SEVEN YEARS OLD.

15:24.224 --> 15:28.595
"I HAVE ASTHMA, BUT I LIKE
TO PLAY TEE BALL WITH PAPA.

15:28.595 --> 15:33.967
I ALSO LIKE TO PLAY CHESS
WITH MOMMY."

15:33.967 --> 15:36.970
- I WANTED TO REMIND YOU
WHO HE WAS.

15:36.970 --> 15:39.072
HECTOR WAS A GOOD BOY.

15:39.072 --> 15:41.074
IS A GOOD BOY.

15:41.074 --> 15:43.343
- MS. RODRIGUEZ,
I UNDERSTAND

15:43.343 --> 15:46.413
YOU HAD A CUSTODY DISPUTE
WITH HECTOR'S FATHER?

15:46.413 --> 15:51.051
- HE WANTED TO RAISE HECTOR
IN THE PENTECOSTAL CHURCH.

15:51.051 --> 15:54.354
MY FAMILY IS CATHOLIC.
IT BROKE US UP.

15:54.354 --> 15:56.189
BUT HE DIDN'T TAKE HECTOR.

15:56.189 --> 15:58.191
- YOU'RE IN TOUCH
WITH HIM?

15:58.191 --> 16:00.293
- HIS FAMILY.

16:00.293 --> 16:05.232
HE DOESN'T HAVE MY SON.
SOMEBODY ELSE DOES.

16:05.232 --> 16:07.634
THIS IS ABOUT
THAT MISSING RICH BOY

16:07.634 --> 16:09.502
THAT'S BEEN ALL OVER
THE NEWS.

16:09.502 --> 16:11.371
HE WAS THE SAME AGE
AS HECTOR.

16:11.371 --> 16:16.343
- DO YOU, UH...
RECOGNIZE THIS MAN?

16:16.343 --> 16:19.079
- [sighs]
NO.

16:19.079 --> 16:21.714
DO YOU THINK HE'S THE ONE WHO
MAY HAVE TAKEN MY HECTOR TOO?

16:21.714 --> 16:23.483
- WE DON'T KNOW THAT.

16:23.483 --> 16:26.253
- SO...YOU CAME HERE
TO TORTURE ME?

16:26.253 --> 16:27.620
- DELORES...

16:27.620 --> 16:29.789
- DO YOU HOW MANY PEOPLE
I GET LETTERS FROM

16:29.789 --> 16:32.525
SAYING THEY'VE SEEN HECTOR?

16:32.525 --> 16:35.295
PSYCHICS CLAIMING
THEY HAD A VISION OF HECTOR

16:35.295 --> 16:37.497
WITH HIS CHECKERBOARD BACKPACK--
PENDEJOS!

16:37.497 --> 16:43.336
- DID THESE LETTERS CONTAIN
ANY REAL INFORMATION?

16:43.336 --> 16:44.604
COULD WE TAKE A LOOK AT 'EM?

16:44.604 --> 16:46.306
- I THROW THEM ALL OUT.

16:46.306 --> 16:50.277
EXCEPT FOR THE ONE
I SENT YOU.

16:50.277 --> 16:52.545
- I NEVER GOT A LETTER
FROM YOU.

16:54.347 --> 16:55.682
- THAT'S RIGHT.

16:55.682 --> 16:58.351
HE TOLD ME TO SEND IT
TO COLD CASE.

16:58.351 --> 17:00.720
- WHO?
THE LETTER WRITER?

17:00.720 --> 17:03.556
- YEAH.
HE SAID HE WAS A COP.

17:03.556 --> 17:05.792
HE DIDN'T SIGN HIS NAME,
BUT HE SAID

17:05.792 --> 17:08.828
TO KEEP PRESSURING HIS BOSSES
ABOUT HECTOR,

17:08.828 --> 17:11.531
OR IT WOULD HAPPEN AGAIN.

17:11.531 --> 17:14.634
- SENORA, WHEN DID YOU GET
THIS LETTER?

17:14.634 --> 17:16.569
- ON HECTOR'S 13TH BIRTHDAY.

17:16.569 --> 17:19.672
COLD CASE GAVE UP...

17:19.672 --> 17:21.574
JUST LIKE YOU DID.

17:27.180 --> 17:29.116
- YOU'RE FROM SPECIAL VICTIMS?

17:29.116 --> 17:30.350
I'D LOVE TO GET OVER
TO YOUR UNIT

17:30.350 --> 17:33.253
AND SEE SOME LIVE BODIES
FOR A CHANGE.

17:33.253 --> 17:36.456
- THERE'S SOMETHING TO BE SAID
FOR WORKING COLD CASE, THOUGH.

17:36.456 --> 17:38.691
THE JOB DOESN'T HAUNT YOU
THE SAME WAY.

17:38.691 --> 17:40.260
- IT HAUNTS YOU
IN A DIFFERENT WAY.

17:40.260 --> 17:43.096
OKAY, HERE IT IS.

17:45.798 --> 17:47.467
- "STAY ON THEM, DELORES.

17:47.467 --> 17:49.236
"NYPD SHOULD GO TO BED
EVERY NIGHT

17:49.236 --> 17:52.539
"WITH THE CRIES OF YOUR
MISSING CHILD IN THEIR EARS...

17:52.539 --> 17:55.342
- LEST MORE FLAMES BURN
THE INNOCENT."

17:55.342 --> 17:57.410
THIS READS LIKE A CRAZY.
- YEP.

17:57.410 --> 17:58.778
THE DETECTIVE GAVE IT
A QUICK FOLLOW-UP.

17:58.778 --> 18:00.780
TRACED A PRINT BACK
TO AN AUXILIARY COP.

18:00.780 --> 18:02.815
SAID HE WAS OFF HIS MEDS.

18:02.815 --> 18:05.218
- STEPHEN LOMATIN?

18:05.218 --> 18:08.855
HE WAS ON HECTOR'S SEARCH TEAM.
HE'S A BEDBUG.

18:08.855 --> 18:10.557
- DID YOU EVER THINK
HE COULD HAVE DONE IT?

18:10.557 --> 18:12.259
- I QUESTIONED HIM.

18:12.259 --> 18:15.162
A REAL BOO RADLEY.
HE DOESN'T HAVE IT IN HIM.

18:15.162 --> 18:16.729
- ANY IDEA WHERE HE IS NOW?
- IF I HAD TO GUESS,

18:16.729 --> 18:19.699
HE'S OUT LOOKING FOR WYATT,
TRYING TO BE THE HERO.

18:24.671 --> 18:27.274
- STEPHEN LOMATIN.
HEARD YOU FOUND SOMETHING.

18:27.274 --> 18:28.875
- FOUND IT RIGHT THERE
BY THAT TREE.

18:28.875 --> 18:30.543
COULD BE THE CAP
WYATT WAS WEARING.

18:30.543 --> 18:33.246
- NICE CATCH.

18:33.246 --> 18:34.647
DETECTIVE AMANDA ROLLINS,
SPECIAL VICTIMS.

18:34.647 --> 18:37.284
WE WERE HOPING YOU COULD COME IN
AND HELP US OUT.

18:37.284 --> 18:40.587
- GENTLEMEN, YOU GOT THIS?

18:40.587 --> 18:44.224
LADIES, I'M ALL YOURS.
YOU NEED A RIDE?

18:47.627 --> 18:48.928
- HE'S A LITTLE YOUNG
FOR THE DESCRIPTION.

18:48.928 --> 18:51.331
- FUZZY VIDEO,
THE DAD'S BAD AT FACES.

18:51.331 --> 18:53.566
LOMATIN'S BEEN AUXILIARY
IN MORNINGSIDE HEIGHTS

18:53.566 --> 18:54.801
FOR 15 YEARS.

18:54.801 --> 18:56.303
- EVEN THOUGH
HE LIVES IN BROOKLYN

18:56.303 --> 18:57.837
AND WORKS MALL SECURITY THERE.

18:57.837 --> 18:59.406
- SO HE LIKES
THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

18:59.406 --> 19:01.408
ANYTHING ELSE TO TIE HIM
TO EITHER KIDNAPPING?

19:01.408 --> 19:02.875
- YOU MEAN BESIDES
THE ANONYMOUS LETTER

19:02.875 --> 19:04.544
HE SENT TO HECTOR'S MOM,

19:04.544 --> 19:06.379
AND THE KEY PIECE OF EVIDENCE
HE FOUND TONIGHT?

19:06.379 --> 19:09.316
- THE BASEBALL CAP.
DO WE KNOW IF IT'S WYATT'S?

19:09.316 --> 19:10.817
- IT HAS A NUMBER TWO PIN
ON IT.

19:10.817 --> 19:12.485
THE LAB'S CHECKING
THE HAIR STRAND TO CONFIRM.

19:12.485 --> 19:13.553
- HE WAS ALL OVER HECTOR'S CASE.

19:13.553 --> 19:15.355
MAYBE I UNDERESTIMATED HIM.

19:15.355 --> 19:18.391
- CAPTAIN, YOU GUYS, I JUST
FOUND THIS ON THE INTERNET.

19:18.391 --> 19:21.494
IT'S A NEWSCAST FROM THE WEEK
HECTOR RODRIGUEZ DISAPPEARED.

19:21.494 --> 19:25.598
- IT WAS STEPHEN LOMATIN,
A YOUNG AUXILIARY OFFICER

19:25.598 --> 19:28.235
WHO FIRST DISCOVERED
THE MISSING BOY'S LUNCH BOX.

19:28.235 --> 19:30.270
STEPHEN, HOW EMOTIONAL
WAS IT FOR YOU

19:30.270 --> 19:32.439
WHEN YOU MADE THAT DISCOVERY?

19:32.439 --> 19:34.441
- IT WAS VERY EMOTIONAL.
THIS JOB CAN BE VERY EMOTIONAL.

19:34.441 --> 19:35.942
- HELL OF A COINCIDENCE.

19:35.942 --> 19:38.611
THIS GUY IS THE ZELIG
OF MISSING CHILD CASES.

19:38.611 --> 19:40.313
- I MEAN,
IF HE'S OUR GUY,

19:40.313 --> 19:42.782
HE'S BEEN CARRYING THIS SECRET
FOR 13 YEARS.

19:42.782 --> 19:45.218
- WELL, Y'ALL INTERVIEWED HIM
BACK IN '99--HOW'D IT GO?

19:45.218 --> 19:46.553
- WELL, HE WAS MAD AT ME
BECAUSE I DIDN'T TREAT HIM

19:46.553 --> 19:47.987
AS A BROTHER OFFICER.

19:47.987 --> 19:49.922
- GOOD.
DO IT AGAIN.

19:49.922 --> 19:53.660
- WITH PLEASURE.

19:53.660 --> 19:56.396
HEY, LOMATIN,
LONG TIME NO SEE.

19:56.396 --> 19:59.266
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

19:59.266 --> 20:01.968
- I WAS ABOUT TO ASK YOU
THE SAME THING.

20:01.968 --> 20:03.836
- LIKE LAST TIME?

20:03.836 --> 20:06.273
YOU TREATED ME LIKE A SKELL
INSTEAD OF A COP.

20:06.273 --> 20:08.408
NOW IT'S HAPPENED AGAIN,
JUST LIKE I SAID IT WOULD.

20:08.408 --> 20:10.877
- EVERY TIME A BOY GOES MISSING
IN MORNINGSIDE HEIGHTS,

20:10.877 --> 20:12.779
YOU'RE JOHNNY ON THE SPOT,
AREN'T YOU?

20:12.779 --> 20:14.013
- I'M HERE TO HELP, OKAY?

20:14.013 --> 20:15.415
YOU CAN'T TALK TO ME
LIKE THIS.

20:15.415 --> 20:18.017
I'M GOING BACK UP THERE.

20:18.017 --> 20:19.919
- MUNCH, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

20:19.919 --> 20:21.288
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN, CAPTAIN?

20:21.288 --> 20:24.391
- OFFICER LOMATIN,
I APOLOGIZE.

20:24.391 --> 20:25.725
THE SERGEANT ISN'T RUNNING
THIS INVESTIGATION.

20:25.725 --> 20:26.959
THESE DETECTIVES ARE.

20:26.959 --> 20:28.961
AND WE APPRECIATE
YOUR ASSISTANCE.

20:28.961 --> 20:30.563
MY OFFICE, NOW!

20:30.563 --> 20:31.964
- THANK YOU, CAPTAIN.

20:31.964 --> 20:34.301
- OKAY.
- THAT GUY'S A SERGEANT NOW?

20:34.301 --> 20:35.635
AND THEY WON'T LET ME
ON THE JOB?

20:35.635 --> 20:37.370
- YOU FINDING THAT CAP,
NICE WORK.

20:37.370 --> 20:39.639
ALL THE OTHER OFFICERS
WALKED RIGHT BY IT.

20:39.639 --> 20:41.874
- YEAH, WELL,
THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS.

20:41.874 --> 20:43.042
YOU'LL BE LOOKING AT SOMETHING
AND NOT SEE IT

20:43.042 --> 20:44.744
TILL SOMEONE ELSE
COMES ALONG.

20:44.744 --> 20:46.913
- WELL, THEY SHOULD HAVE
LISTENED TO YOU 13 YEARS AGO.

20:46.913 --> 20:49.682
- THEY? YOU WERE THERE.

20:49.682 --> 20:51.984
I REMEMBER.

20:51.984 --> 20:54.387
- I WASN'T.

20:54.387 --> 20:57.424
I MEAN, STEPHEN,
TALK TO ME.

20:57.424 --> 20:59.592
- STEVE, NOT STEPHEN.

20:59.592 --> 21:00.927
AND THESE CASES,
THEY'RE ALL CONNECTED.

21:00.927 --> 21:03.896
- "THESE CASES."
YOU MEAN WYATT AND HECTOR.

21:03.896 --> 21:07.400
- YOU DON'T GET IT, DO YOU?

21:07.400 --> 21:10.937
YOU GET IT.

21:10.937 --> 21:13.440
I CAN SHOW YOU,
DETECTIVE ROLLINS.

21:13.440 --> 21:15.842
IT'S ALL IN MY ARCHIVE.

21:18.945 --> 21:20.380
- STEVIE, I THOUGHT
YOU WERE OUT LOOKING

21:20.380 --> 21:21.714
FOR THAT MISSING BOY.

21:21.714 --> 21:23.383
- THE DETECTIVES NEED TO SEE
MY RESEARCH.

21:23.383 --> 21:25.918
IT'S IN THE ATTIC.
COME ON, I'LL SHOW YOU.

21:25.918 --> 21:29.789
- EXCUSE US, MA'AM.

21:57.684 --> 22:01.754
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS,
A MUSEUM OF LOST BOYS?

22:01.754 --> 22:03.423
- YOU DON'T GET IT.

22:03.423 --> 22:05.124
BUT SHE DOES.

22:05.124 --> 22:07.427
YOU SEE WHAT'S GOING ON,
DON'T YOU?

22:07.427 --> 22:11.764
- YEAH, STEVE,
I THINK I DO.

22:18.938 --> 22:20.640
- GUYS, CAN YOU GIVE US
THE ROOM?

22:20.640 --> 22:23.376
- SURE.
- THANK YOU.

22:23.376 --> 22:25.745
NOW, JUST WALK ME THROUGH
A FEW THINGS.

22:25.745 --> 22:28.147
YOU KNOW,
WHEN HECTOR DISAPPEARED,

22:28.147 --> 22:30.883
HE WAS LAST SEEN
WITH HIS HAIR DYED BLOND.

22:30.883 --> 22:32.619
- I KNOW.
THAT'S WHY I BOUGHT THAT DYE.

22:32.619 --> 22:33.853
I WAS TRYING TO FIND
THE RIGHT SHADE

22:33.853 --> 22:35.021
TO FIGURE OUT
WHERE IT CAME FROM.

22:35.021 --> 22:37.624
- DID YOU GET ANY LEADS
OFF THAT?

22:37.624 --> 22:38.891
- NO. IT'S A COMMON BRAND.

22:38.891 --> 22:40.159
EVERY DRUGSTORE
IN THE CITY SELLS IT.

22:40.159 --> 22:41.761
- WHAT ABOUT THESE GLASSES?

22:41.761 --> 22:43.430
- SAME THING.
THE OTHER BOYS WERE ALL TAKEN

22:43.430 --> 22:44.764
BY MEN WEARING THOSE TYPE
OF SUNGLASSES.

22:44.764 --> 22:46.098
- AND YOU KEEP SAYING
THESE OTHER BOYS.

22:46.098 --> 22:49.502
AND THOSE PICTURES
IN YOUR ROOM...

22:49.502 --> 22:51.404
TELL ME ABOUT THEM.

22:51.404 --> 22:53.406
- I HAVE SEVEN UNSOLVED
DISAPPEARANCES

22:53.406 --> 22:55.408
OVER 13 YEARS
IN THREE COUNTIES.

22:55.408 --> 22:56.776
FOUR OF THE BOYS,
AGES SIX TO NINE,

22:56.776 --> 22:58.778
WERE ALL TAKEN BY MEN
WEARING A DISGUISE.

22:58.778 --> 23:00.179
- OKAY, SO YOU'RE ONTO
A LARGER PATTERN HERE.

23:00.179 --> 23:01.881
THAT'S GOOD.

23:01.881 --> 23:03.149
- CAPTAIN, HE'S GOT
CHILDREN'S CLOTHES,

23:03.149 --> 23:05.518
SURVEILLANCE PHOTOS,
BLOND HAIR DYE,

23:05.518 --> 23:07.487
AND DISGUISES.

23:07.487 --> 23:09.722
SEE IF ANYONE I.D.s HIM.

23:11.891 --> 23:15.695
- YEAH, I KNOW HIM
FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

23:15.695 --> 23:17.096
HE AND HECTOR WERE FRIENDS.

23:17.096 --> 23:19.566
- SO HE KNEW HECTOR?
- YEAH.

23:19.566 --> 23:22.935
THERE WERE NO REAL POLICEMEN
WALKING THE BEAT UP HERE.

23:22.935 --> 23:25.104
I TOLD HECTOR
IF HE GOT IN TROUBLE,

23:25.104 --> 23:28.441
HE SHOULD GO
TO OFFICER LOMATIN.

23:28.441 --> 23:30.209
WHY ARE YOU ASKING
ABOUT HIM?

23:30.209 --> 23:32.712
- BECAUSE HE'S THE ONE
WHO SENT YOU THAT LETTER

23:32.712 --> 23:34.180
SEVEN YEARS AGO.

23:34.180 --> 23:37.950
- YOU'RE WRONG.
WHY WOULD HE SEND THE LETTER?

23:37.950 --> 23:39.652
WE NEVER LOST TOUCH.

23:39.652 --> 23:44.190
HE LIGHTS A CANDLE
AT HECTOR'S MEMORIAL EVERY YEAR.

23:44.190 --> 23:46.993
HE NEVER GAVE UP
ON FINDING HIM.

23:46.993 --> 23:50.129
- DELORES...

23:50.129 --> 23:51.798
I JUST WISH
YOU WOULD HAVE TOLD ME

23:51.798 --> 23:53.933
ABOUT OFFICER LOMATIN
BEING SO HELPFUL.

23:53.933 --> 23:55.802
- WHY?

23:55.802 --> 24:00.439
BECAUSE HE KEPT LOOKING
WHEN YOU STOPPED?

24:03.075 --> 24:06.613
- LOOK, HAVE YOU EVER SEEN
THIS MAN BEFORE?

24:06.613 --> 24:08.615
- UH, I DON'T THINK SO.
WHO IS HE?

24:08.615 --> 24:09.916
- WHY ARE YOU GONNA ASK HIM?

24:09.916 --> 24:12.785
HE WOULDN'T RECOGNIZE
HIS OWN FATHER.

24:12.785 --> 24:15.855
IT'S THAT PRETEND COP.
- YOU KNOW HIM?

24:15.855 --> 24:18.057
- FROM THE PLAYGROUND.
- HAS HE EVER TALKED TO YOU

24:18.057 --> 24:20.059
OR TO WYATT?
- HE TALKED TO ALL THE KIDS.

24:20.059 --> 24:22.962
HAVE YOU SEEN HIM TODAY?
IS THIS HIM?

24:22.962 --> 24:24.030
- I DON'T KNOW.
I THOUGHT HE WAS OLDER--

24:24.030 --> 24:25.798
- DAMN IT, DAVID!

24:25.798 --> 24:28.000
YOU BENT DOWN TO PICK UP A 20
AND YOU LOST OUR CHILD?

24:28.000 --> 24:30.937
- SHUT UP!
I LOVE WYATT, ALL RIGHT?

24:30.937 --> 24:33.640
[both shouting at once]
- HEY! HEY! HOLD ON!

24:33.640 --> 24:35.742
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S ENOUGH.
THAT'S ENOUGH.

24:35.742 --> 24:39.912
BOTH OF YOU!

24:39.912 --> 24:42.148
- [sobbing]

24:42.148 --> 24:44.884
- LOOK, I KNOW WHERE YOU ARE
RIGHT NOW.

24:44.884 --> 24:48.020
BUT YOU NEED
TO GET PAST IT.

24:55.962 --> 24:58.931
- LOOK, I'M SORRY.
I'M--

24:58.931 --> 25:02.869
- [sobbing]

25:02.869 --> 25:05.572
- I'M SO SORRY.

25:05.572 --> 25:08.808
JUST BRING HIM BACK
TO US, PLEASE.

25:15.815 --> 25:18.184
- HECTOR RODRIGUEZ DISAPPEARS
AUGUST 9, 1999.

25:18.184 --> 25:20.152
TWO DAYS LATER, FIRE
AT A BUILDING AROUND THE CORNER.

25:20.152 --> 25:21.954
- OKAY.
- JORGE DIAZ, BROOKLYN.

25:21.954 --> 25:24.624
JULY, 2001.
FIRE NEXT DAY.

25:24.624 --> 25:27.026
DANTE BORRELLI, YONKERS, 2006.

25:27.026 --> 25:29.796
A WEEK LATER, FOUR-ALARMER
AT A SUGAR FACTORY.

25:29.796 --> 25:32.899
- OKAY, AND YOUR THEORY
ON THE CONNECTION IS?

25:32.899 --> 25:34.300
- IT'S OBVIOUS.
SOMEBODY'S SNATCHING THE KIDS

25:34.300 --> 25:36.168
AND SETTING FIRES
TO GET RID OF THE BODIES.

25:36.168 --> 25:37.670
IF WE DON'T FIND WYATT SOON,

25:37.670 --> 25:39.606
ANOTHER BUILDING
WILL BURN DOWN.

25:39.606 --> 25:40.840
- OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT, STEVE?
THIS IS GOOD.

25:40.840 --> 25:42.842
THIS--IT'S GREAT.

25:42.842 --> 25:44.977
AND I WANT TO SHOW MY CAPTAIN
ALL YOUR WORK,

25:44.977 --> 25:47.146
BUT I KNOW HE'S GONNA INSIST
THAT YOU TELL US

25:47.146 --> 25:49.582
WHERE YOU WERE TODAY.

25:49.582 --> 25:51.918
- I'LL TELL YOU.
YOU CAN VERIFY IT...

25:51.918 --> 25:53.920
BUT YOU CAN'T TELL ANYBODY.

25:53.920 --> 25:57.023
- OKAY, STEVE, I PROMISE.

25:57.023 --> 25:58.791
- SO HIS ALIBI IS LEGIT?

25:58.791 --> 26:01.027
- YEAH.
DRUGSTORE IN BROOKLYN

26:01.027 --> 26:03.362
HAS HIM ON VIDEO
AT THE PHARMACY WINDOW

26:03.362 --> 26:05.264
WHEN WYATT WAS SNATCHED.

26:05.264 --> 26:08.901
- SO WHY WOULDN'T LOMATIN JUST
TELL US THAT RIGHT OFF THE BAT?

26:08.901 --> 26:10.136
- HE WAS PICKING UP
PRESCRIPTIONS

26:10.136 --> 26:12.004
FOR AN ANTIDEPRESSANT,
ANTIANXIETY,

26:12.004 --> 26:13.305
AND ANTIPSYCHOTIC.

26:13.305 --> 26:14.707
HE WAS AFRAID IT WILL KILL
HIS CHANCES

26:14.707 --> 26:16.175
OF MAKING NYPD.

26:16.175 --> 26:17.877
- GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.
- AND THAT'S NOT ALL.

26:17.877 --> 26:20.212
AN HOUR LATER,
HE WAS BACK AT THE DRUGSTORE

26:20.212 --> 26:22.949
PICKING UP A CHILD-SIZE
BASEBALL CAP--

26:22.949 --> 26:24.817
THE ONE HE FOUND
ON THE STREET.

26:24.817 --> 26:27.920
GIRL REMEMBERS BECAUSE
HE PAID IN CHANGE.

26:27.920 --> 26:31.223
- GREAT, SO ALL OF THIS IS
JUST THE OBSESSIVE SCRAWL

26:31.223 --> 26:34.193
OF A WANNABE HERO
TAKING ANTIPSYCHOTICS?

26:34.193 --> 26:35.695
- MAYBE NOT.
JUST BECAUSE HE'S CRAZY

26:35.695 --> 26:37.964
DOESN'T MEAN HE'S WRONG.

26:37.964 --> 26:39.231
- THERE DOES SEEM TO BE
SOME CONNECTION

26:39.231 --> 26:41.033
BETWEEN THESE MISSING KIDS
AND ARSON.

26:41.033 --> 26:42.735
LOMATIN MAY HAVE BEEN
ONTO SOMETHING

26:42.735 --> 26:44.370
WITH THOSE PATTERNS
OF HIS.

26:44.370 --> 26:46.405
- I'M LOOKING AT THIS,
AND I DON'T SEE A PATTERN.

26:46.405 --> 26:48.040
I SEE CHAOS.

26:48.040 --> 26:50.109
- SOME OF THEM ARE RIGHT.
BROOKLYN AND YONKERS

26:50.109 --> 26:51.377
HAD FIRES
AFTER THOSE ABDUCTIONS.

26:51.377 --> 26:53.012
- BUT NOT MORNINGSIDE HEIGHTS.

26:53.012 --> 26:55.682
THAT FIRE WAS THREE DAYS
BEFORE HECTOR DISAPPEARED.

26:55.682 --> 26:57.183
I REMEMBER THAT BECAUSE
WE WERE ALWAYS WALKING BY

26:57.183 --> 26:58.785
THAT BURNT-OUT LOT.

26:58.785 --> 27:00.352
- I'M CHECKING NEARBY
BUILDING RECORDS.

27:00.352 --> 27:03.255
- I DON'T REMEMBER ANY FIRES
AFTER THAT ABDUCTION.

27:03.255 --> 27:05.191
- NO, BUT HERE'S SOMETHING.

27:05.191 --> 27:07.727
OKAY, FOUR DAYS LATER,
A BUILDING AROUND THE CORNER

27:07.727 --> 27:10.096
CLAIMED WATER DAMAGE
FROM THAT FIRE.

27:10.096 --> 27:12.832
THEY GOT A RUSH PERMIT
FOR CONCRETE WORK

27:12.832 --> 27:14.366
IN THEIR BASEMENT.

27:16.335 --> 27:20.840
- OKAY, I'LL CALL THE D.A.,

27:20.840 --> 27:24.010
GET AN EMERGENCY ORDER
TO CRACK THE SLAB.

27:26.312 --> 27:28.647
[jackhammers pounding]

27:41.193 --> 27:44.130
- THAT'S GOOD.

27:55.341 --> 27:57.844
- I GOT SOMETHING.

28:13.392 --> 28:16.328
[doorbell buzzes]

28:16.328 --> 28:18.097
- THE WORST PART
ABOUT BEING A COP?

28:18.097 --> 28:19.465
- YEAH.

28:19.465 --> 28:22.935
[door unlocks]

28:22.935 --> 28:24.503
- WHAT IS IT?

28:24.503 --> 28:27.840
- DELORES,
CAN WE COME IN?

28:43.489 --> 28:45.758
- YES?

28:45.758 --> 28:49.028
- DELORES,
WE MAY HAVE FOUND--

28:49.028 --> 28:52.899
- STOP. PLEASE.

28:52.899 --> 28:56.803
I JUST WANT ONE MORE SECOND
TO BELIEVE

28:56.803 --> 28:59.371
THAT HECTOR'S COMING BACK.

29:02.541 --> 29:04.176
- SIENTO.

29:07.346 --> 29:09.381
HIS BACKPACK.

29:09.381 --> 29:11.350
- THIS IS HIS.

29:11.350 --> 29:15.822
OH, MY GOD, WHERE DID YOU--

29:24.530 --> 29:28.868
[sobbing]
OH, MY BABY!

29:28.868 --> 29:31.370
OH, MY BABY!

29:31.370 --> 29:33.405
MY BABY!

29:33.405 --> 29:35.007
[sobbing]

29:35.007 --> 29:38.544
MY BABY!

29:38.544 --> 29:41.981
HECTOR!

29:41.981 --> 29:45.251
- SO WARNER LOOKED
AT THE DENTAL RECORDS

29:45.251 --> 29:47.286
AND THE DYED HAIR.

29:47.286 --> 29:49.488
FINALLY FOUND HECTOR.

29:49.488 --> 29:51.557
- ALL THESE YEARS
WE BLAMED HIS FATHER.

29:51.557 --> 29:53.359
- WARNER HAVE
THE CAUSE OF DEATH?

29:53.359 --> 29:57.096
- YEAH, SHE FOUND A FRACTURED
HYOID BONE IN THE NECK.

29:57.096 --> 29:59.431
HE WAS STRANGLED.

29:59.431 --> 30:01.567
- ANY LEADS
ON WHO POURED THAT SLAB?

30:01.567 --> 30:05.271
- IN '99, THE BUILDING BELONGED
TO DAVIDSON LLC.

30:05.271 --> 30:07.306
IT'S AN OVERSEAS-OWNED
HOLDING COMPANY.

30:07.306 --> 30:09.208
THAT WAS THEIR ONLY PROPERTY.

30:09.208 --> 30:11.878
THEY SOLD IT OFF FIVE YEARS
LATER AND DISSOLVED THE LLC.

30:11.878 --> 30:14.280
THIS IS INTERESTING.

30:14.280 --> 30:17.616
THEY SELL TO MORNINGSIDE LLC,

30:17.616 --> 30:21.453
WHO GO ON TO ACQUIRE THREE
ADJACENT PARCELS ON THE BLOCK.

30:21.453 --> 30:25.391
- THAT BLOCK, THAT WAS ALL
SRO HOTELS, TENEMENTS.

30:25.391 --> 30:29.929
THEY GOT EMPTIED OUT AND
CONVERTED INTO EASTMORN CONDOS.

30:29.929 --> 30:31.430
- THESE ARE ALL FRONTS.
THE BUYER DOESN'T WANT

30:31.430 --> 30:33.199
THE SELLERS TO KNOW
THAT THE BLOCK IS IN PLAY.

30:33.199 --> 30:36.235
- OKAY, SO MORNINGSIDE WAS
BEHIND THE FRONT ALL ALONG.

30:36.235 --> 30:37.636
WHO ARE THEY?

30:37.636 --> 30:41.941
- ANOTHER LLC,
BUT THE CONDO MANAGING AGENTS?

30:41.941 --> 30:45.344
SAM AND FRANK MORRIS.

30:45.344 --> 30:47.579
- DAVID'S FATHER AND UNCLE?

30:47.579 --> 30:49.381
- WAIT, HECTOR WAS BURIED
IN A BUILDING OWNED

30:49.381 --> 30:51.483
BY WYATT'S GRANDFATHER?

30:51.483 --> 30:53.585
- LOMATIN WAS RIGHT.

30:53.585 --> 30:57.389
THERE ARE NO COINCIDENCES.

30:57.389 --> 31:00.626
- THE BOY IN THAT MURAL?

31:00.626 --> 31:02.094
OH, MY GOD.

31:02.094 --> 31:04.196
- SO MY FAMILY OWNED
THE BUILDING

31:04.196 --> 31:05.497
WHERE THEY FOUND HECTOR.

31:05.497 --> 31:07.599
THERE'S GOTTA BE
A COINCIDENCE.

31:07.599 --> 31:10.536
- HE WAS BURIED BENEATH
A CONCRETE FLOOR

31:10.536 --> 31:13.572
THAT WAS POURED FOUR DAYS AFTER
HE WAS ABDUCTED.

31:13.572 --> 31:15.908
- I FEEL SORRY FOR THIS BOY,

31:15.908 --> 31:17.543
BUT WHAT DOES THIS HAVE
TO DO WITH WYATT?

31:17.543 --> 31:19.345
- WE JUST NEED TO KNOW WHO
WOULD HAVE PUT THAT FLOOR IN.

31:19.345 --> 31:21.247
WAS THERE A BUILDING MANAGER,
A SUPER?

31:21.247 --> 31:23.082
- IN '99?
I HAVE NO IDEA.

31:23.082 --> 31:25.684
I WASN'T IN THE BUSINESS THEN.
IT WAS A GHETTO.

31:25.684 --> 31:28.454
- AND YOUR FATHER'S GONE?

31:28.454 --> 31:31.991
SO WE'RE GONNA NEED YOU
TO TRACK IT DOWN.

31:31.991 --> 31:33.325
- MY DAD KEPT
HANDWRITTEN RECORDS

31:33.325 --> 31:34.660
OF THE FIRST BUILDING
HIS FATHER BOUGHT

31:34.660 --> 31:36.595
DURING THE DEPRESSION--
NOTHING ON COMPUTER.

31:36.595 --> 31:38.064
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT
THE TENANTS.

31:38.064 --> 31:39.565
WE JUST NEED THE SUPER
OF THE BUILDING.

31:39.565 --> 31:45.137
- I HAVE INSPECTION
CERTIFICATES FROM '98.

31:45.137 --> 31:48.440
MANAGING AGENT IS LISTED
AS AN L. HODDA.

31:48.440 --> 31:50.642
HODDA...

31:50.642 --> 31:53.312
I HAD A MEETING WITH
A LEWIS HODDA FOUR MONTHS AGO.

31:53.312 --> 31:55.081
- ABOUT WHAT?

31:55.081 --> 31:57.316
- HE WAS HAVING
MONEY PROBLEMS,

31:57.316 --> 31:59.051
AND HE SAID
MY FATHER OWED HIM.

31:59.051 --> 32:00.586
- HE SAY WHAT HE DID
FOR YOUR FATHER?

32:00.586 --> 32:02.521
- HE'S A TROUBLESHOOTER.
YOU KNOW, RENT STRIKES,

32:02.521 --> 32:03.722
ILLEGAL TENANTS, DRUG DEALERS.

32:03.722 --> 32:05.257
DAD HIRED
SOME ROUGH CHARACTERS.

32:05.257 --> 32:08.160
- THIS LEWIS HODDA,

32:08.160 --> 32:09.561
YOU REMEMBER
WHAT HE LOOKED LIKE?

32:09.561 --> 32:11.663
- HE'S A TOUGH GUY.
A LOT OF MILEAGE.

32:11.663 --> 32:12.999
I TOLD YOU,
I'M NOT VERY VISUAL.

32:12.999 --> 32:14.200
- DAVID,
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA

32:14.200 --> 32:16.402
HOW WE CAN GET
IN TOUCH WITH HIM?

32:16.402 --> 32:19.371
- HE COMPLAINED ABOUT
A BASEMENT APARTMENT HE HAD

32:19.371 --> 32:22.174
IN ONE OF MY FATHER'S
OLD BUILDINGS.

32:22.174 --> 32:25.444
- POLICE!
SEARCH WARRANT!

32:25.444 --> 32:28.580
LET ME SEE YOUR HANDS!
LET ME SEE YOUR HANDS!

32:28.580 --> 32:30.482
GET UP! COME ON!

32:30.482 --> 32:32.451
- HEY, WHAT THE HELL?
[groans]

32:32.451 --> 32:34.453
- LEWIS HODDA.
- WHERE'S THE BOY, LEWIS?

32:34.453 --> 32:35.654
- THERE'S NOBODY HERE.

32:35.654 --> 32:38.590
- WYATT? WYATT?

32:38.590 --> 32:40.492
- WE'RE LOOKING FOR A MISSING
SEVEN-YEAR-OLD BOY

32:40.492 --> 32:42.228
NAMED WYATT MORRIS.

32:42.228 --> 32:44.730
WHERE IS HE?
- NEVER HEARD OF HIM.

32:44.730 --> 32:46.298
- MAYBE THIS WILL JAR
YOUR MEMORY.

32:46.298 --> 32:48.034
YOU WORKED FOR HIS GRANDFATHER.

32:48.034 --> 32:49.735
- HE'S NOT HERE.

32:49.735 --> 32:52.304
- WHAT'D YOU DO
WITH THE BOY?

32:52.304 --> 32:54.373
WHAT'D YOU DO WITH THE BOY?
- GET OUT.

32:54.373 --> 32:56.242
YOU GOT NOTHIN'.

32:56.242 --> 32:58.077
- WELL, WE GOT
A LITTLE SOMETHING HERE.

32:58.077 --> 33:01.413
PRESCRIPTIONS FOR VICODIN
AND OXYCODONE

33:01.413 --> 33:03.249
FOR AN AMY ROSENTHAL.

33:03.249 --> 33:05.017
THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME.
- [chuckles]

33:05.017 --> 33:07.019
YOU BUST MY DOOR DOWN
OVER A COUPLE LOUSY

33:07.019 --> 33:08.454
BOOTLEG SCRIPS? WOW!

33:08.454 --> 33:10.656
- NOW YOU'RE TALKING.
GET HIS ASS OUT OF HERE!

33:10.656 --> 33:12.724
- LET'S GO.

33:17.396 --> 33:18.630
- IS LEWIS HODDA OUR GUY?

33:18.630 --> 33:19.731
- THE WAITRESS
FROM THE PASTRY SHOP

33:19.731 --> 33:21.367
PICKED HIM OUT
OF A FLIP BOOK.

33:21.367 --> 33:23.535
- YEAH, BUT THE WITNESS
FROM THE CONVENIENCE STORE

33:23.535 --> 33:25.304
AND THE SUBWAY ARE SHAKY.

33:25.304 --> 33:28.040
- DAVID MORRIS SAID HE WAS
A TROUBLESHOOTER FOR THE FAMILY.

33:28.040 --> 33:29.441
DO WE KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS?

33:29.441 --> 33:32.044
- I CALLED THE PRECINCT,
AND HODDA WAS QUESTIONED

33:32.044 --> 33:33.379
FOUR TIMES IN THE '90s

33:33.379 --> 33:35.614
BY MARSHALS INVESTIGATING
ARSONS ON SROs,

33:35.614 --> 33:38.250
TENEMENTS, AND OTHER BUILDINGS
THE MORRISES WANTED GONE.

33:38.250 --> 33:40.752
- HANG ON, I JUST FOUND
TWO POLICE CONTACTS FOR LEWIS

33:40.752 --> 33:43.555
IN THE NCIC OFFLINE
DATABASE.

33:43.555 --> 33:45.424
HE WAS QUESTIONED TWICE...

33:45.424 --> 33:48.427
NEAR PLAYGROUNDS
IN BROOKLYN AND YONKERS

33:48.427 --> 33:50.796
IN '01 AND '06.

33:50.796 --> 33:53.132
- THOSE ARE THE SAME YEARS
THAT JORGE DIAZ

33:53.132 --> 33:54.700
AND DANTE BORRELLI
WENT MISSING.

33:54.700 --> 33:57.369
- AND ON LOMATIN'S TIMELINE,
THERE WAS A FIRE

33:57.369 --> 33:59.705
WITHIN A WEEK AFTER
THESE BOYS' DISAPPEARANCE.

33:59.705 --> 34:03.142
- PEDOPHILE/ARSONIST.
HE WOULDN'T BE THE FIRST.

34:03.142 --> 34:04.543
- WE'RE GETTING AHEAD
OF OURSELVES HERE.

34:04.543 --> 34:06.378
DO WE EVEN KNOW
WHO OWNED THOSE BUILDINGS

34:06.378 --> 34:08.114
IN BROOKLYN AND YONKERS?

34:08.114 --> 34:09.648
- CAPTAIN, WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,
WE DON'T HAVE TIME.

34:09.648 --> 34:11.117
WE'LL MAKE THE CASE LATER.

34:11.117 --> 34:14.553
- LET'S GO.
- JUST STOP.

34:14.553 --> 34:17.556
HE'S GONNA BE PISSED AT YOU TWO
FOR BRINGING HIM IN.

34:17.556 --> 34:21.560
BENSON, AMARO, GO.

34:27.799 --> 34:29.768
- WOW.

34:29.768 --> 34:34.506
THOSE SCARS ON YOUR ARM,
I CAN SEE WHERE THEY COME FROM.

34:34.506 --> 34:35.774
YOU DID THESE, RIGHT?

34:35.774 --> 34:37.143
YOU WORKED
FOR DAVID MORRIS' FATHER

34:37.143 --> 34:38.544
AS A TORCH.

34:38.544 --> 34:41.347
- YOU'RE GOOD.
MAYBE THE BEST.

34:41.347 --> 34:43.249
THE MARSHALS NEVER
LAID A GLOVE ON YOU.

34:43.249 --> 34:44.616
- EXCUSE ME, DETECTIVES,

34:44.616 --> 34:46.385
BUT THIS HAPPENED
A LONG TIME AGO.

34:46.385 --> 34:49.455
NO ONE DIED IN THESE FIRES.

34:49.455 --> 34:51.523
NOTHING TO DISCUSS.

34:51.523 --> 34:54.560
- SAM MORRIS MADE A FORTUNE
OFF YOUR WORK.

34:54.560 --> 34:56.162
WHAT'D YOU GET OUT OF IT?

34:56.162 --> 34:58.397
- THAT'S THE WAY IT WORKS.

34:58.397 --> 35:02.434
THE PIONEERS GET THE ARROWS,
SETTLERS GET THE LAND.

35:02.434 --> 35:05.904
- TELL US ABOUT
376 MANHATTAN AVE.

35:05.904 --> 35:09.341
- I THINK THAT STARTED
AS A GREASE FIRE

35:09.341 --> 35:10.709
AT A CHINESE RESTAURANT
NEXT DOOR.

35:10.709 --> 35:12.411
UH...YEAH.

35:12.411 --> 35:14.713
- NO, IT ACTUALLY STARTED
IN A COMIC BOOK STORE

35:14.713 --> 35:16.415
ON THE GROUND FLOOR
OF THAT BUILDING.

35:16.415 --> 35:18.550
THE TENANTS WERE
ON RENT STRIKE AT THE TIME.

35:18.550 --> 35:21.687
- OH, YEAH, YEAH,
THE COMIC BOOK STORE.

35:21.687 --> 35:23.222
YEAH, YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN
THE KIDS CRYING.

35:23.222 --> 35:25.457
[mumbles]
YEAH.

35:25.457 --> 35:29.361
- WAS, UH--
WAS HECTOR ONE OF 'EM?

35:29.361 --> 35:31.497
- NEVER HEARD OF HIM.
I NEVER SEEN HIM BEFORE.

35:31.497 --> 35:33.365
- ARE YOU SURE
ABOUT THAT, LEWIS?

35:33.365 --> 35:36.235
'CAUSE YOU WORKED
AS THE MANAGING AGENT

35:36.235 --> 35:37.269
RIGHT AROUND THE BLOCK.

35:37.269 --> 35:38.870
- WAS I?
- YEAH.

35:38.870 --> 35:41.407
YOU SIGNED
FOR A CONCRETE DELIVERY

35:41.407 --> 35:45.944
AT YOUR BUILDING
A WEEK AFTER THE FIRE.

35:45.944 --> 35:49.781
- UM, THE WATER FROM THE HOSES
FLOODED THE BASEMENT.

35:49.781 --> 35:52.451
WE HAD TO PUT DOWN
A NEW SLAB.

35:52.451 --> 35:54.253
- THE TROUBLE WITH THAT,
LEWIS,

35:54.253 --> 35:56.455
IS THAT THAT BUILDING?

35:56.455 --> 35:58.724
OVER 100 YARDS FROM THE FIRE.

35:58.724 --> 36:02.628
WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE
FOR THE WATER TO REACH THAT FAR.

36:02.628 --> 36:04.630
- WELL, IT MUST HAVE BEEN
A PIPE THAT BURST, YOU KNOW?

36:04.630 --> 36:06.298
- BUT YOU WERE THERE
WHEN THE CONCRETE WAS POURED?

36:06.298 --> 36:07.499
- YEAH.

36:07.499 --> 36:09.901
- YOU WANT TO EXPLAIN
HOW HECTOR

36:09.901 --> 36:11.470
ENDED UP BURIED THERE?

36:11.470 --> 36:15.307
- LOOK, THERE'S 40 RESIDENTS.

36:15.307 --> 36:18.877
HALF OF 'EM ON PAROLE,
DONE TIME.

36:18.877 --> 36:20.479
CHECK WITH ANY OF THEM.

36:20.479 --> 36:21.647
- YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WHO WAS QUESTIONED

36:21.647 --> 36:23.649
FOR HANGING AROUND
PLAYGROUNDS

36:23.649 --> 36:26.752
IN BROOKLYN AND YONKERS.

36:28.854 --> 36:31.790
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

36:31.790 --> 36:34.293
- IN 2001...

36:34.293 --> 36:38.530
YOU WERE QUESTIONED
FOR KIDDIE-PEEPING IN BUSHWICK,

36:38.530 --> 36:41.267
TWO DAYS BEFORE
JORGE DIAZ DISAPPEARS.

36:41.267 --> 36:43.835
A WEEK LATER,
A WAREHOUSE BURNED DOWN.

36:43.835 --> 36:46.472
- WHERE ARE YOU GETTING
THIS STUFF, HUH, TWILIGHT ZONE?

36:46.472 --> 36:49.641
- 2006, DANTE BORRELLI
DISAPPEARS IN YONKERS,

36:49.641 --> 36:53.879
RIGHT BEFORE
THE SUGAR FACTORY FIRE.

36:53.879 --> 36:57.316
COME ON, LEWIS,
JUST TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED.

36:57.316 --> 36:59.751
AFTER HECTOR,
YOU REALIZED

36:59.751 --> 37:02.854
YOU'RE ALREADY STARTING
THE FIRES.

37:02.854 --> 37:04.423
YOU MIGHT AS WELL
USE THEM

37:04.423 --> 37:06.658
TO GET RID
OF THE LITTLE BOYS' BODIES.

37:08.927 --> 37:10.496
WHOA!

37:10.496 --> 37:13.299
- WHY DON'T YOU GET OUT
OF MY WAY, SISTER?

37:13.299 --> 37:15.634
- NO...
- I'M DONE. I'M OUTTA HERE.

37:15.634 --> 37:16.768
I GOT NOTHING TO SAY
TO YOU PEOPLE!

37:16.768 --> 37:17.936
- NO. NO, NO, LEWIS.

37:17.936 --> 37:19.571
- HEY, TAKE IT EASY,
ALL RIGHT?

37:19.571 --> 37:21.573
SETTLE--SETTLE DOWN.

37:21.573 --> 37:23.609
- YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE
THIS TIME, LEWIS.

37:23.609 --> 37:25.010
SEE, IT'S OVER.

37:25.010 --> 37:27.779
AND YOU WANNA KNOW WHY?

37:27.779 --> 37:29.581
BECAUSE WE HAVE WITNESSES
PUTTING YOU

37:29.581 --> 37:33.585
AT ALL OF THOSE
CRIME SCENES.

37:33.585 --> 37:35.954
NOBODY LIKES A CHOMO, LEWIS.

37:35.954 --> 37:38.590
ESPECIALLY NOT
IN STATE PRISON.

37:40.826 --> 37:43.629
- I DIDN'T TOUCH THOSE KIDS.
I DIDN'T.

37:43.629 --> 37:47.366
- THAT LABEL ON YOU,
AT YOUR AGE?

37:47.366 --> 37:52.871
THAT MEANS HARD TIME.
HARD TIME.

37:52.871 --> 37:55.774
- LOOK, I'M NOT A CHICKENHAWK.
I'M NO CHICKENHAWK, I'M NOT.

37:55.774 --> 37:57.576
- ALL RIGHT, HEY, LOOK.
- I'M NOT.

37:57.576 --> 37:59.411
- LISTEN TO ME.
YOU'RE GOOD FOR THE FIRES.

37:59.411 --> 38:02.581
BUT THESE LITTLE BOYS,
YOU NEVER TOUCHED 'EM?

38:02.581 --> 38:03.982
THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?

38:03.982 --> 38:07.919
- THAT'S RIGHT.
I'M A PROFESSIONAL.

38:07.919 --> 38:11.690
I WAS JUST, UH, YOU KNOW,
DOING MY JOB.

38:11.690 --> 38:13.659
- I BELIEVE YOU,
ALL RIGHT?

38:13.659 --> 38:15.727
BUT IF YOU DON'T WANT THE D.A.
PUTTING THIS ON YOU,

38:15.727 --> 38:18.864
YOU NEED US TO HELP YOU.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.503
- YOU'RE GONNA HELP ME?
YOU'RE GONNA HELP ME?

38:24.503 --> 38:26.004
- HEY, YOU WORKED HARD
FOR OLD MAN MORRIS, RIGHT?

38:26.004 --> 38:28.907
RIGHT?
TOOK A LOT OF RISKS.

38:28.907 --> 38:31.843
YOU MADE A LOT OF MONEY
FOR HIS FAMILY.

38:31.843 --> 38:33.512
AND WHEN IT CAME TIME
FOR HIS SON

38:33.512 --> 38:35.581
TO DO RIGHT BY YOU,
THAT LITTLE SNOT ACTED LIKE

38:35.581 --> 38:37.583
HE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW YOU.
- LOOK.

38:37.583 --> 38:39.017
AFTER WHAT I DID
FOR THAT FAMILY,

38:39.017 --> 38:41.653
THEY SHOULD HAVE GIVEN ME
THE PENTHOUSE.

38:41.653 --> 38:43.789
THE OLD MAN, HE HAD BALLS.

38:43.789 --> 38:48.627
DAVID MORRIS?
HE DON'T HAVE NO IDEA--

38:48.627 --> 38:52.598
NONE--WHAT IT TAKES
TO EMPTY A BUILDING.

38:52.598 --> 38:55.834
YOU DON'T DO IT WITH BUYOUTS
AND BS LAWSUITS.

38:55.834 --> 38:59.638
YOU DO IT WITH FIRE.

38:59.638 --> 39:00.872
- RIGHT.

39:00.872 --> 39:02.708
- AND LIKE YOU SAID, SISTER,

39:02.708 --> 39:05.611
I GOT THE SCARS TO PROVE IT.
I'M IN THE HALL OF FAME,

39:05.611 --> 39:06.978
LIKE, YOU KNOW,
PETE ROSE SHOULD BE.

39:06.978 --> 39:08.547
- SO YOU TOOK WYATT.

39:08.547 --> 39:11.850
NOT BECAUSE YOU WANTED
TO DO ANYTHING UNCLEAN,

39:11.850 --> 39:15.387
BUT BECAUSE YOU WANTED THEM
TO SHOW YOU RESPECT.

39:15.387 --> 39:18.890
- ALL RIGHT,
SO MORRIS OWED YOU.

39:18.890 --> 39:21.727
- RIGHT.
- WE CAN PUT THAT OUT THERE.

39:21.727 --> 39:24.863
WE CAN SAY THAT
THERE WAS A RANSOM DEMAND.

39:24.863 --> 39:26.598
- AND WITH HECTOR,
EVERYBODY KNOWS

39:26.598 --> 39:28.967
THAT BOY HAD ASTHMA.

39:28.967 --> 39:32.471
HE MUST HAVE JUST...
STOPPED BREATHING

39:32.471 --> 39:33.805
WHEN HE WAS WITH YOU.

39:33.805 --> 39:35.841
- YEAH, WE CAN PUT
ALL OF THAT OUT THERE.

39:35.841 --> 39:37.676
BUT IF YOU WANT US
TO DO THAT,

39:37.676 --> 39:40.779
YOU'VE GOTTA
GIVE US SOMETHING, LEWIS.

39:40.779 --> 39:42.881
- HMM?

39:42.881 --> 39:47.719
- YOU HAVE TO TELL US
WHERE WYATT IS RIGHT NOW.

39:51.189 --> 39:55.093
[siren blares, stops]

39:55.093 --> 39:57.596
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO.
MOVING OUT.

40:01.099 --> 40:04.836
- OKAY, WE'RE IN!
- ONE MORE.

40:04.836 --> 40:06.838
BOTH IN.

40:06.838 --> 40:10.476
- POLICE!
SEARCH WARRANT!

40:10.476 --> 40:14.145
[overlapping chatter]

40:14.145 --> 40:16.648
- FIN, ROLLINS.

40:18.850 --> 40:21.587
