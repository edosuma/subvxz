WEBVTT

00:01.960 --> 00:03.884
Previously on "Batwoman"...

00:03.887 --> 00:05.605
- So you're into me.
- You would know.

00:05.608 --> 00:07.700
- I'll call you then.
- I'd like that.

00:07.702 --> 00:09.725
Bruce never stopped looking

00:09.728 --> 00:10.777
for your sister's body.

00:10.779 --> 00:13.072
Guy had the best tech on the planet.

00:13.075 --> 00:14.432
Why didn't he find her?

00:14.435 --> 00:15.616
I think Alice is Beth.

00:15.619 --> 00:17.064
I thought they found her body.

00:17.067 --> 00:18.456
They found bone fragments.

00:18.459 --> 00:20.861
Skull fragments matching Beth's DNA.

00:20.864 --> 00:22.122
She's your daughter!

00:22.124 --> 00:23.323
King of the Crows

00:23.325 --> 00:25.630
can't even protect your own nest.

00:25.633 --> 00:26.964
How'd you get in my house?

00:26.967 --> 00:28.435
You're making this personal, Alice.

00:28.438 --> 00:30.423
It is personal!

00:30.426 --> 00:31.471
What the hell do you want?

00:31.474 --> 00:34.271
You're gonna tell me
everything you know about Alice.

00:34.274 --> 00:36.061
You're not Batman.

00:36.063 --> 00:37.539
That's the point.

01:05.729 --> 01:06.925
Shiny, shiny.

01:22.733 --> 01:24.566
Keep your Tiffanys close

01:24.569 --> 01:26.595
and your Mikimoto closer, Gotham.

01:26.598 --> 01:30.223
Last night marks the third
bling theft in a week,

01:30.226 --> 01:32.828
this time nearly killing
a guard in the process.

01:32.831 --> 01:35.590
Well, today, everyone is
asking "Where was Batwoman?"

01:35.593 --> 01:38.002
Hot off the heels of her citywide debut,

01:38.005 --> 01:39.954
and she's a no-show.

01:39.957 --> 01:41.990
Seriously, was she curling her hair,

01:41.993 --> 01:44.871
overcome by the myriad
of red lipstick shades,

01:44.873 --> 01:46.692
going through a breaku...

01:46.695 --> 01:48.541
Thank you.

01:48.544 --> 01:50.194
Going through a breakup?

01:50.196 --> 01:52.950
That woman literally risked
her life protecting this city.

01:52.953 --> 01:54.640
Well, I heard she's doing Batman.

01:54.642 --> 01:56.166
- Oh, you heard?
- Mm-hmm.

01:56.168 --> 01:58.251
From who... Killer Croc?

01:58.253 --> 02:00.234
I kind of like her actually.

02:00.237 --> 02:02.338
Gotham could use a woman's touch.

02:02.340 --> 02:04.492
Um, so you're into redheads now?

02:04.495 --> 02:08.237
No, not at this exact moment.

02:24.797 --> 02:27.713
I hate whoever that is.

02:30.093 --> 02:35.971
Oh. Sorry. It's my... my,
um... my friend type thing.

02:35.974 --> 02:40.961
Uh, girlfriend? Because that's
what that just sounded like.

02:40.964 --> 02:42.941
No. It's a guy friend, a co-worker.

02:42.944 --> 02:44.368
We... we share an office space.

02:44.371 --> 02:49.093
The, uh... water main broke.

02:49.096 --> 02:51.830
That sounds really serious.

02:51.833 --> 02:55.350
I know. Yeah. I should probably go.

02:55.352 --> 02:57.207
You come over superlate,

02:57.210 --> 02:59.207
you leave before breakfast.

02:59.210 --> 03:03.066
I feel like I could date
you and start a new hobby.

03:03.068 --> 03:05.377
I'll make it up to you.

03:08.990 --> 03:11.866
Okay. I have to go. I have to go.

03:11.868 --> 03:13.701
- Ha ha ha!
- Stay dry.

03:13.703 --> 03:15.596
I have to go.

03:20.394 --> 03:22.561
A wise woman once said,

03:22.563 --> 03:24.137
"Hurt me with the truth.

03:24.139 --> 03:27.090
Don't comfort me with a lie."

03:27.092 --> 03:30.811
Yes, Bruce. I'm quoting Rihanna

03:30.813 --> 03:32.683
because I'm not a liar.

03:32.686 --> 03:34.691
I have never hidden who I am.

03:34.694 --> 03:37.475
I came out when Brad Morrison
told all the kids at school

03:37.477 --> 03:39.319
that I was gay.

03:39.321 --> 03:43.265
I said, "Yeah, and?" Then punched him.

03:43.268 --> 03:45.707
Ever since then, I've been out and proud

03:45.710 --> 03:47.167
as long as I can remember,

03:47.170 --> 03:49.128
so how the hell am I supposed to wake up

03:49.131 --> 03:50.905
every morning and hide who I am?

03:50.907 --> 03:52.865
That is brilliant,

03:52.868 --> 03:54.501
uh, but do watch the glare, Margot.

03:54.503 --> 03:55.955
Can I get a bounce card?

03:55.958 --> 03:58.163
Hey. Want to tell me
what the hell is going on?

03:58.166 --> 03:59.573
You must be Roxanna.

03:59.576 --> 04:02.099
Such a pleasure, Miss Kane.

04:02.102 --> 04:04.114
The museum of antiquities is so grateful

04:04.117 --> 04:06.313
you're lending us
Martha Wayne's necklace.

04:06.315 --> 04:08.515
We cannot think of a better showpiece

04:08.518 --> 04:10.091
to represent strong women

04:10.093 --> 04:11.610
and pillars of their community.

04:11.612 --> 04:14.354
She always loved your museum.

04:14.356 --> 04:16.630
Margot, is that the last lens change?

04:16.632 --> 04:19.011
- Yes.
- Shall we get a few mores shots?

04:19.014 --> 04:21.560
And then we can get
out of miss Kane's hair.

04:21.563 --> 04:25.207
- Where have you been?
- Nowhere.

04:25.209 --> 04:27.465
I'm seeing someone.

04:27.468 --> 04:29.485
You... okay.

04:29.487 --> 04:32.706
So while you've been...

04:32.708 --> 04:36.844
That, Magpie struck again.

04:36.846 --> 04:38.530
She nuked a place last night,

04:38.533 --> 04:40.261
nearly killed a security guard.

04:40.264 --> 04:44.050
The vine work is so, uh, earth chic.

04:44.052 --> 04:45.734
It's a work in progress.

04:45.737 --> 04:47.999
Well, with that giant
Wayne sign on the building,

04:48.002 --> 04:50.721
I'm sure whatever it is
will make Gotham proud.

04:50.724 --> 04:52.967
- No pressure, right?
- I'll have our security team

04:52.970 --> 04:54.325
bring the necklace
to the event tomorrow.

04:54.327 --> 04:57.823
Smart. With everything that's
been happening around the city,

04:57.825 --> 05:00.409
you can never be too careful.

05:02.162 --> 05:06.331
So that is not why I called.

05:06.333 --> 05:08.457
So your pet Dodgson,
not looking too good

05:08.460 --> 05:10.193
and probably no smelling great.

05:10.195 --> 05:11.578
What are we doing here?

05:13.582 --> 05:15.323
He hangs out until he tells us

05:15.325 --> 05:16.332
Alice's grand plan.

05:16.335 --> 05:18.389
- Or he dies.
- He's just dehydrated.

05:18.392 --> 05:19.869
- He's septic.
- Were you this annoying

05:19.871 --> 05:22.474
when Batman took people prisoner?

05:22.477 --> 05:25.499
I didn't think so.

05:29.631 --> 05:32.816
Yeah. He needs an E.R.

06:11.473 --> 06:15.883
Does your husband know
what's in plot 283, Catherine?

06:15.885 --> 06:18.737
Shh. Your driver's gone nighty-night.

06:18.739 --> 06:21.106
He's on a benzo break.

06:21.108 --> 06:23.850
What are you doing here?

06:23.852 --> 06:26.936
Heh. The great existential question.

06:26.938 --> 06:29.564
What are we all doing here?

06:29.566 --> 06:31.823
You know the thing I
love about bad guys?

06:31.826 --> 06:34.086
Is that despite ourselves we are all so

06:34.088 --> 06:35.950
tragically predictable.

06:35.953 --> 06:38.394
Of course, you'd follow the cards I left

06:38.397 --> 06:41.939
right back there to cover your tracks.

06:43.455 --> 06:44.996
What do you want?

06:44.998 --> 06:47.507
Hmm. To keep this to myself,

06:47.509 --> 06:52.086
and in return, you are
gonna give me something,

06:52.088 --> 06:55.086
a very powerful toy.

06:55.089 --> 06:58.309
I understand that Hamilton
Dynamics is developing

06:58.311 --> 07:01.471
a very "top-secret" weapon.

07:01.473 --> 07:03.041
I own one of the largest

07:03.044 --> 07:04.748
defense companies in the country.

07:04.751 --> 07:07.774
I'm hardly privy to its
day-to-day project management side.

07:07.777 --> 07:10.697
Oh, but you are. You are the priviest

07:10.699 --> 07:15.293
because this particular
project was your idea.

07:16.296 --> 07:17.704
How do you know that?

07:17.706 --> 07:20.075
Well, I spent in an hour
in your house, Catherine.

07:20.078 --> 07:22.766
What did you think... I was just
poking around your shoe closet?

07:22.769 --> 07:25.804
Which should be its
own monument by the way.

07:25.806 --> 07:31.806
Yeah. You are gonna give it
to me by 10 p.m. tomorrow,

07:31.887 --> 07:34.969
or Commander Kane will
know that you're the one

07:34.972 --> 07:39.102
who convinced him his
dear, darling daughter

07:39.105 --> 07:40.864
was dead.

07:52.074 --> 07:53.957
Oh, my God!

07:55.243 --> 08:00.839
Oh, my God! Hi! You're Batwoman!

08:00.841 --> 08:04.700
Mary Hamilton. Huge fan

08:04.702 --> 08:07.042
but not in, like, an annoying way.

08:07.045 --> 08:09.514
Can I just say welcome to
Gotham, and you know what?

08:09.516 --> 08:10.882
Screw the haters.

08:10.884 --> 08:12.425
I once wore this jumpsuit,

08:12.427 --> 08:13.918
and it was bordering on last season...

08:13.920 --> 08:15.490
I need your help.

08:15.493 --> 08:17.031
I heard you're discreet.

08:17.034 --> 08:19.218
Okay. Yeah. Anything.

08:21.916 --> 08:26.460
Oh. Okay. So he actually
just tried to kill me,

08:26.463 --> 08:30.814
so... that's not me saying no.

08:30.817 --> 08:34.034
It's just slightly more complicated.

08:34.038 --> 08:35.265
Why do you have him?

08:35.267 --> 08:37.708
I need to know what Alice is planning.

08:42.698 --> 08:45.019
This is grossly infected.

08:45.022 --> 08:49.868
You don't have any
neosporin in your batbelt?

08:49.871 --> 08:51.422
Can you save him?

08:51.424 --> 08:52.799
I can try

08:52.801 --> 08:55.227
because I actually subscribe to a code.

08:55.229 --> 08:58.212
It's called do no harm.

08:58.214 --> 08:59.681
I'll be back for him.

08:59.683 --> 09:01.608
We'll be here.

09:03.570 --> 09:05.553
Hopefully alive.

09:05.555 --> 09:08.910
If I wanted
to be a beacon of hope to Gotham,

09:08.913 --> 09:11.750
I needed to show them that I was there.

09:11.753 --> 09:14.345
I had to restore their
confidence in the Bat,

09:14.348 --> 09:17.023
and to do that, I needed to catch Gotham's

09:17.025 --> 09:18.274
most dangerous thief.

09:18.276 --> 09:19.626
Batcave to Batwoman.

09:19.628 --> 09:21.591
How long have you waited to say that?

09:21.594 --> 09:23.710
Honestly, it just came to
me two seconds ago, so...

09:23.713 --> 09:25.363
- What do you want?
- I've been thinking

09:25.366 --> 09:27.408
why is this Magpie
Woman so hard to track?

09:27.411 --> 09:28.845
You know, police can't find her,

09:28.848 --> 09:30.385
she's one step ahead of the Crows.

09:30.388 --> 09:32.629
No trace of her on
any city surveillance,

09:32.632 --> 09:34.042
and then it occurred to me...

09:34.045 --> 09:35.812
Everyone's looking for a woman

09:35.815 --> 09:39.554
when we should be looking for a bird.

09:39.556 --> 09:41.523
Eagle cams.

10:07.718 --> 10:10.030
Do we have to be on opposite sides?

10:10.033 --> 10:12.420
Birds of a feather
should flock together.

10:12.422 --> 10:15.140
I'm allergic to feathers.

10:18.645 --> 10:20.887
An egg? Really committed to this

10:20.889 --> 10:22.222
whole bird thing, aren't you?

10:22.224 --> 10:23.691
Really think it's worth that?

10:23.694 --> 10:25.341
Maybe not to you, but to me,

10:25.343 --> 10:26.726
it's food, a roof over my head,

10:26.728 --> 10:29.053
and a modicum of dignity.

10:49.149 --> 10:52.015
Batarang? More like Batawhiff.

10:52.018 --> 10:54.516
According to the
gallery security footage,

10:54.519 --> 10:57.868
last night our lady
crusader missed the return

10:57.871 --> 10:59.786
on her not-so-trusty Batarang

10:59.789 --> 11:02.915
and caused some major
damage to a gilded vase

11:02.918 --> 11:05.863
that once belonged to Marie Antoinette,

11:05.865 --> 11:08.791
and we thought Magpie
was a threat to this city.

11:08.801 --> 11:11.119
Talk to me, Gotham.
Do we need to take out

11:11.122 --> 11:13.548
an insurance policy on our new hero?

11:13.551 --> 11:15.626
You probably miscalculated the position.

11:15.629 --> 11:16.963
- I didn't.
- Maybe you angled it wrong.

11:16.965 --> 11:18.539
- Maybe it's broken.
- It's not broken.

11:18.542 --> 11:19.659
If it worked, I would have caught it.

11:19.661 --> 11:20.911
Did you try flipping your wrist back...

11:20.913 --> 11:22.463
You're Batsplaining. I already have

11:22.465 --> 11:23.502
the whole city on my ass.

11:23.505 --> 11:25.307
I do not need you joining in the chorus.

11:25.310 --> 11:26.909
Well, good news, bad news.

11:26.911 --> 11:29.795
I figured out what you ripped
off Magpie's belt last night...

11:29.797 --> 11:31.463
Grenades.

11:31.465 --> 11:33.057
Yeah, cute but no less deadly.

11:33.059 --> 11:34.804
Concussion or fragmentation?

11:34.807 --> 11:37.454
Probably an M-67 filled
with TNT or gunpowder.

11:37.457 --> 11:39.233
I'll know more after I
run a chemical analysis.

11:39.235 --> 11:40.598
It could help us track down Magpie.

11:40.600 --> 11:41.800
How long will that take?

11:41.803 --> 11:43.826
Depending on the complexity
of the deformulation...

11:43.828 --> 11:45.352
Hour and a half.

11:45.354 --> 11:47.187
Great. I'll see you then.

11:47.189 --> 11:48.855
Wait. Where you going?

11:48.857 --> 11:50.908
I owe someone a lunch.

11:50.910 --> 11:53.821
Someone. A date. Cool.
Yeah. No. I'll be here,

11:53.824 --> 11:55.732
not dating anyone
because I love to work.

11:55.735 --> 11:59.750
Love to work. This is great. Have fun.

12:12.881 --> 12:14.932
Pretty song.

12:14.934 --> 12:17.016
Alice was playing it when she broke

12:17.019 --> 12:19.283
into the penthouse the other night.

12:19.286 --> 12:21.590
Alice plays the Cello?

12:21.593 --> 12:26.412
That's so... on brand.

12:26.415 --> 12:29.112
Beth played the Cello.

12:29.115 --> 12:32.026
This was her favorite piece.

12:32.029 --> 12:33.536
Do you think...

12:33.539 --> 12:35.063
What'd you bring me?

12:35.066 --> 12:38.555
Ahem. The report detailing the bomb

12:38.558 --> 12:40.991
that blew up Alice's transport van.

12:40.993 --> 12:43.869
I thought you'd want to
see it before anyone else.

12:43.871 --> 12:48.165
It's an IED using high
standard components.

12:48.167 --> 12:49.967
The convoy had 7 vehicles.

12:49.969 --> 12:53.244
It hit Alice's van
with a 99.9% accuracy.

12:53.247 --> 12:55.819
Bomb probably used an
advanced sensor initiation

12:55.822 --> 12:59.009
to detect its target.

12:59.011 --> 13:01.476
A sensor with that level of detection

13:01.479 --> 13:06.080
is unreleased technology
unique to Hamilton Dynamics.

13:06.083 --> 13:07.582
What are you saying?

13:07.585 --> 13:09.811
Bomb's one of ours?

13:13.335 --> 13:17.086
Why would someone at Hamilton
want to ambush the convoy?

13:20.404 --> 13:22.164
You're living with polar bears

13:22.167 --> 13:24.409
under the borealis, no rent, no traffic,

13:24.412 --> 13:27.544
no getting mugged in
line grabbing a coffee.

13:27.547 --> 13:29.932
Why the hell did you move back here?

13:29.934 --> 13:32.619
- Long story.
- So an ex-girlfriend.

13:32.622 --> 13:35.754
- Wow.
- Told you I could read people.

13:35.756 --> 13:37.923
Her name is Sophie,
and she's in the past,

13:37.926 --> 13:39.560
and according to her, we never even had

13:39.563 --> 13:41.121
a past, so there's that.

13:41.124 --> 13:44.545
You came home for your ex
who doesn't see you as an ex?

13:44.548 --> 13:47.182
Sounds like I have
nothing to worry about.

13:47.184 --> 13:50.602
Why am I talking about her?

13:50.604 --> 13:52.221
I used to live there.

13:52.223 --> 13:55.479
Before it was that, it was a
small, charming 10-unit place full

13:55.482 --> 13:57.941
of sweet, neighborly,
hard-working people,

13:57.944 --> 14:01.446
who all got exiled to parts of
the city that no one cared about.

14:01.449 --> 14:04.519
Meanwhile, all the
predatory real estate moguls

14:04.522 --> 14:07.644
who don't give a crap about
the lives they're uprooting

14:07.647 --> 14:09.029
get rich.

14:09.031 --> 14:11.633
You were literally evicted
from your childhood.

14:11.636 --> 14:13.077
That's awful.

14:13.080 --> 14:15.977
Not that I wanted to live
in a Crows district anyway.

14:15.980 --> 14:18.672
- No offense.
- You googled me.

14:18.674 --> 14:19.874
Of course I did.

14:19.876 --> 14:22.651
No one's allowed to
have secrets anymore.

14:23.488 --> 14:25.104
So does that mean you will tell me

14:25.106 --> 14:26.401
where we're going for lunch?

14:26.404 --> 14:29.205
It does. My Mom taught English
to the woman who owns the place.

14:29.208 --> 14:32.328
She's supercute and has
the best tofu paneer.

14:32.330 --> 14:34.163
I think you're gonna like it.

14:39.432 --> 14:42.028
Another plumbing emergency?

14:42.030 --> 14:46.616
Uh, electrical fire in
the... ventilation system.

14:46.618 --> 14:49.178
That sounds like a real mess.

14:49.180 --> 14:51.588
What is that you do again?

14:51.590 --> 14:55.208
Nothing really. Just keeping
tabs on my cousin's building.

14:55.210 --> 14:57.686
Not so good at it, huh?

14:58.338 --> 15:02.153
There's a fundraiser later
at the antiquities museum.

15:02.156 --> 15:03.614
Want to be my date?

15:03.617 --> 15:05.676
Um... maybe.

15:05.679 --> 15:09.181
Come on. 9:30. No emergencies.

15:09.183 --> 15:10.866
Please, please, please, please.

15:10.868 --> 15:13.101
Okay. Hold you to it.

15:13.103 --> 15:15.037
9:30.

15:31.132 --> 15:33.858
Oh. You got to be kidding me.

15:55.220 --> 15:56.654
Hmm.

16:04.631 --> 16:05.755
Ow. Come on.

16:05.757 --> 16:07.632
She stole the necklace.

16:07.634 --> 16:09.759
She took it by feathers and force.

16:09.761 --> 16:13.596
I'll let the museum know
they're losing their showpiece.

16:13.598 --> 16:17.220
Bruce's Mom was killed
for that necklace.

16:17.223 --> 16:19.118
Yeah.

16:19.121 --> 16:22.772
He spent years looking
for it in the streets,

16:22.774 --> 16:24.503
finally found it in an auction,

16:24.506 --> 16:28.611
and spent $1 million buying it back.

16:28.613 --> 16:31.373
I should have been here.

16:31.375 --> 16:34.610
I have to get it back.
Any leads on the bomb?

16:34.613 --> 16:37.556
Actually, yeah. Magpie
3-D printed them.

16:37.559 --> 16:40.456
- That's new.
- Yeah, I know.

16:40.458 --> 16:42.643
Nanothermites via inkjet.

16:42.645 --> 16:44.460
- Explosive ink?
- It's regulated.

16:44.462 --> 16:45.637
Only a few companies sell it.

16:45.639 --> 16:47.149
Then we find everyone that it's sold to.

16:47.151 --> 16:49.632
Well, you now, the Crows
do track munition shipments

16:49.634 --> 16:50.876
in and out of the city.

16:50.878 --> 16:52.635
You could ask your girl
Sophie if she can get

16:52.637 --> 16:55.204
a list of who's buying exploding ink.

16:55.207 --> 16:57.264
It's bad timing.

16:57.267 --> 16:59.350
Bad timing,

16:59.352 --> 17:01.934
a bomber loose in Gotham.

17:01.937 --> 17:03.746
I...

17:05.483 --> 17:07.968
Exploding ink. That's specific.

17:07.971 --> 17:11.029
Magpie used one to
break into Wayne Tower.

17:11.031 --> 17:12.839
She take anything?

17:12.840 --> 17:15.175
My aunt Martha's Pearl necklace.

17:15.176 --> 17:18.512
Damn. Does your Dad know?

17:20.132 --> 17:22.749
Copy.

17:24.219 --> 17:26.798
Heard the Bat had a run-in
with her the other night.

17:26.800 --> 17:30.893
The Bat? I thought they were
calling her Batwoman now.

17:30.896 --> 17:32.067
Is that official?

17:32.069 --> 17:34.806
I think so. It's catchy, mature.

17:34.809 --> 17:39.307
Mm-hmm. So if she's on
the case, why are you?

17:39.309 --> 17:43.370
You know why. I don't trust vigilantes.

17:45.690 --> 17:48.533
Heh. How's the search going?

17:51.399 --> 17:52.604
Just texted it to you.

17:52.606 --> 17:54.322
Everyone within a 100-mile radius

17:54.324 --> 17:57.175
who recently purchased explosive ink.

17:59.738 --> 18:02.030
I really appreciate it.

18:03.083 --> 18:05.175
I'm glad you came to me.

18:05.177 --> 18:09.220
I know things between us
have been a little tense,

18:09.222 --> 18:11.898
but we always make a good team.

18:17.072 --> 18:19.281
I have to go.

18:54.053 --> 18:55.695
Unh!

19:00.473 --> 19:03.266
So clever of
Catherine to send you boys

19:03.268 --> 19:05.285
to find my cozy burrow,

19:05.287 --> 19:07.287
but you're not the only ones

19:07.289 --> 19:09.197
with ears all around this city.

19:09.199 --> 19:12.534
When you start asking
about our location,

19:12.536 --> 19:14.628
it gets back to me.

19:14.630 --> 19:19.657
Desperate, desperate
Catherine Hamilton-Kane

19:19.659 --> 19:23.470
sending her goons to clean up her mess.

19:23.472 --> 19:27.314
Perhaps she needs a little reminder

19:27.317 --> 19:31.836
that I'm not playing games!

19:31.838 --> 19:35.107
Who wants to help me
send her a message, hmm?

19:36.426 --> 19:38.068
Hmm?

19:42.745 --> 19:46.455
Eeny, meeny,

19:46.458 --> 19:48.500
miny,

19:48.503 --> 19:50.478
moe.

19:54.578 --> 19:57.153
- You.
- It was him.

19:57.155 --> 19:59.414
You pointed at him.

19:59.416 --> 20:03.326
Like I said, I'm not playing a game.

20:03.328 --> 20:05.619
There are no rules.

20:22.847 --> 20:24.899
Uh, another construction firm,

20:24.902 --> 20:27.696
fireworks manufacturer,
gold mining company.

20:27.699 --> 20:29.393
Wait. This shipment
doesn't have a destination.

20:29.395 --> 20:30.434
Can you key the address?

20:30.437 --> 20:32.529
Yeah. Let me check.

20:32.532 --> 20:35.650
Sophie thinks I'm the Bat.

20:35.652 --> 20:39.120
- How?
- Because I suck at hiding it.

20:39.122 --> 20:43.407
How did Bruce make living
a double life look so easy?

20:43.409 --> 20:45.794
Oh, he didn't. He was miserable.

20:45.796 --> 20:47.128
Bruce Wayne? Guy had 3 Ferraris

20:47.130 --> 20:48.630
and slept with half of Gotham.

20:48.632 --> 20:50.173
The playboy thing gave him a cover.

20:50.175 --> 20:53.084
Different women meant he could
tell the same lies easily, but

20:53.086 --> 20:54.252
sucked for him, too.

20:54.254 --> 20:55.932
Honestly, in those last few months,

20:55.935 --> 20:59.432
I think being Batman was
easier for him than being Bruce.

20:59.434 --> 21:01.717
So the address is a P.O. box.

21:01.719 --> 21:04.029
You can send explosives to a P.O. box?

21:04.032 --> 21:06.364
If you don't want to get caught.

21:09.411 --> 21:11.486
I just got to the old Gotham hotel,

21:11.488 --> 21:14.706
the address linked to
the P.O. box account.

21:16.833 --> 21:18.703
Guy at the facility gave it to me.

21:18.706 --> 21:21.445
Do I want to know how you
got him to tell you that?

21:21.448 --> 21:22.907
Let him take a selfie.

21:22.910 --> 21:24.718
Definitely not the
answer I was expecting.

21:24.721 --> 21:28.169
Let me guess. Batman
never posed for selfies.

21:28.172 --> 21:30.311
Wasn't gonna say it.

21:35.437 --> 21:38.421
I think I found Magpie's nest.

21:38.423 --> 21:42.684
I see jewelry, a computer, 3-D printer,

21:42.686 --> 21:44.444
and my breath ring's freezing.

21:44.446 --> 21:46.264
Oh, that's smart. It's climate-rigged.

21:46.267 --> 21:47.821
If anyone enters, their
body heat will raise

21:47.823 --> 21:50.024
the room's temperature
and set off an explosion.

21:50.026 --> 21:51.812
You may want to lead with that.

21:51.815 --> 21:53.361
Sorry, but yo. Check this out.

21:53.364 --> 21:56.980
The suit can lower your body
temperature to match the room

21:56.983 --> 21:59.043
and bypass the sensors.

21:59.046 --> 22:00.695
That is uncomfortably cold.

22:00.698 --> 22:01.739
Rather cold than dead.

22:01.742 --> 22:03.528
- Oh. One more thing.
- What?

22:03.531 --> 22:04.699
You know you can't breathe, right?

22:04.701 --> 22:06.820
- You're kidding me.
- I didn't invent kinetic energy.

22:06.822 --> 22:08.045
How long can you hold your breath for?

22:08.047 --> 22:09.710
Gets dicey after two minutes.

22:09.713 --> 22:11.732
All right. That's as long as you got.

22:26.354 --> 22:29.972
Actually, now might be a
good time to let you know

22:29.974 --> 22:31.725
that I fixed the Batarang,

22:31.728 --> 22:35.895
and by fixed, I mean realized
it was calibrated for Bruce,

22:35.898 --> 22:38.331
who has longer arms than you.

22:38.333 --> 22:40.074
Guess it wasn't entirely your fault.

22:40.076 --> 22:42.138
You're probably thinking some
pretty choice words right now,

22:42.140 --> 22:44.099
but since you'll blow up
if you say them out loud,

22:44.101 --> 22:45.875
probably best to keep them to yourself.

22:45.878 --> 22:49.472
Anyway, all fixed, recalibrated for you,

22:49.475 --> 22:51.827
a woman with slightly shorter arms.

22:51.830 --> 22:53.420
Oh. While you're in there

22:53.423 --> 22:55.514
if you can try to clone
a copy of her hard drive,

22:55.517 --> 22:56.387
that'd be great.

22:56.390 --> 22:57.790
Might give us a clue
into what Magpie gets

22:57.792 --> 23:00.168
her talons into next.

23:16.062 --> 23:17.603
Definitely been a minute.

23:17.605 --> 23:20.279
Still alive? Don't answer that.

23:23.923 --> 23:25.006
Ah-choo!

23:25.009 --> 23:26.260
Did you just...

23:40.604 --> 23:42.395
Why?

23:44.234 --> 23:47.837
No! Don't want to.

23:50.409 --> 23:52.075
Alice!

23:52.078 --> 23:54.045
Help me.

23:54.048 --> 23:55.545
Alice.

23:55.548 --> 23:58.922
No. I'm not actually Ali...

24:03.660 --> 24:07.504
Curiouser and curiouser.

24:11.593 --> 24:13.292
Alice?

24:13.294 --> 24:16.004
Yes, darling.

24:16.006 --> 24:20.047
It's me. It's Alice.

24:20.050 --> 24:21.666
Where am I?

24:21.669 --> 24:24.436
You're in the rabbit hole, darling,

24:24.439 --> 24:27.440
with the caterpillar and the mad hatter

24:27.442 --> 24:31.093
and the Queen of Hearts.

24:31.095 --> 24:34.781
I'm actually quite happy you're here.

24:34.783 --> 24:38.526
You see, I've foolishly
forgotten the details

24:38.528 --> 24:40.269
of my evil plan.

24:40.271 --> 24:42.455
Perhaps you could...

24:42.457 --> 24:46.170
stir up a memory or two.

24:46.173 --> 24:51.635
She... she thinks

24:51.638 --> 24:54.782
it's me you care about.

24:56.379 --> 24:59.973
Who, dear? The Batwoman?

25:01.747 --> 25:03.014
Darling?

25:03.017 --> 25:05.502
Finish your thought. The Batwoman thinks

25:05.505 --> 25:07.555
I care about whom?

25:07.557 --> 25:11.651
She... has no idea.

25:11.653 --> 25:14.654
About... about who?

25:14.656 --> 25:17.585
Who? Who?

25:17.588 --> 25:19.662
Mouse.

25:19.665 --> 25:24.802
She has... big plans for him.

25:48.789 --> 25:51.747
- In position.
- Let me know when you see her.

25:51.750 --> 25:54.019
Way too much tempting
bling for her not show.

25:54.022 --> 25:55.694
What is that noise?

25:55.697 --> 25:58.325
Magpie had some complicated schematics

25:58.328 --> 26:00.015
for something on her hard drive.

26:00.017 --> 26:01.966
They're encrypted, but
I'll try printing them.

26:01.969 --> 26:03.870
Whatever it is could be her next target

26:03.872 --> 26:04.952
and help us track her down.

26:04.955 --> 26:06.162
I got to go.

26:06.165 --> 26:07.724
Go where?

26:07.727 --> 26:09.793
Reagan's here.

26:09.796 --> 26:12.603
Wait. You invited her to a takedown.

26:12.606 --> 26:14.547
I invited her on a
date that just happens

26:14.550 --> 26:16.049
to be at the takedown location.

26:16.051 --> 26:17.696
I don't need to tell you that...

26:17.699 --> 26:21.147
Batman would have
never done that. I know.

26:38.073 --> 26:39.105
Is it done?

26:39.107 --> 26:41.197
Does this look done to you?

26:41.200 --> 26:42.634
Oh, my God.

26:42.636 --> 26:47.771
That bitch is a rare
breed of psychopath, okay?

26:47.773 --> 26:50.793
Take your money, take your power.

26:50.796 --> 26:54.996
I don't care. This is
your mess, Catherine.

26:54.998 --> 26:57.990
You want her gone, do it yourself.

27:01.671 --> 27:02.987
This is Catherine.

27:02.989 --> 27:05.991
"'Oh, dear, oh,
dear. I shall be too late, '"

27:05.994 --> 27:08.935
said the rabbit, tapping at his watch."

28:02.848 --> 28:04.398
Kate.

28:04.400 --> 28:08.236
Sophie, um, I didn't know
you were working the event.

28:08.238 --> 28:10.312
I wasn't, but I figured

28:10.314 --> 28:12.331
with a jewelry thief on the prowl

28:12.334 --> 28:14.455
we could use the extra manpower.

28:14.458 --> 28:15.958
Of course you did.

28:15.961 --> 28:18.130
- Kate.
- Reagan, hi.

28:18.133 --> 28:20.444
- I'm sorry I'm late.
- Oh.

28:20.447 --> 28:22.657
Hey. Reagan.

28:22.660 --> 28:24.868
- Sophie.
- Figured.

28:28.633 --> 28:32.185
Sorry. I didn't realize
you were here with anyone.

28:35.453 --> 28:38.380
I got us drinks.

28:38.383 --> 28:40.233
You two have fun.

28:58.788 --> 29:00.863
So... I don't know about you,

29:00.865 --> 29:02.406
but I'm gonna drink this and pretend

29:02.408 --> 29:06.636
it's not totally uncomfortable
that your ex is here.

29:11.633 --> 29:13.692
Sorry. I...

29:16.004 --> 29:20.214
Ahem. I'm being a really crappy date.

29:20.217 --> 29:23.069
Can we start over and I mention

29:23.071 --> 29:25.929
how beautiful you look?

29:25.931 --> 29:31.060
Thank you, and I hate that that worked.

29:31.062 --> 29:33.112
Miss Kane, welcome.

29:33.114 --> 29:34.580
I'm so glad you made it.

29:34.582 --> 29:36.025
I'm sorry the pearls didn't.

29:36.028 --> 29:37.358
What do you mean?

29:37.360 --> 29:39.493
Didn't Luke Fox get in touch with you?

29:39.495 --> 29:41.681
Yes, but I was just so relived

29:41.684 --> 29:43.478
when the security guard
showed up with them

29:43.481 --> 29:45.040
in the nick of time.

29:45.043 --> 29:47.760
Perfect timing. Excuse me.

29:49.455 --> 29:52.006
Ladies and gentlemen,

29:52.008 --> 29:54.700
tonight, we are here to celebrate

29:54.703 --> 29:57.204
powerful women throughout history,

29:57.207 --> 30:00.843
and who better embodies
that than Martha Wayne?

30:00.846 --> 30:04.282
It is with utmost gratitude
to the Wayne estate

30:04.285 --> 30:07.063
that I present to you
tonight's showpiece,

30:07.065 --> 30:11.025
her beloved pearl necklace.

30:13.270 --> 30:15.550
Would you excuse me for a minute?

30:18.818 --> 30:20.137
I was just about to call you.

30:20.140 --> 30:22.152
Martha's necklace is at the
exhibit, which is impossible

30:22.154 --> 30:23.330
because we never gave it to the museum.

30:23.332 --> 30:25.160
That is not her necklace. It's a replica.

30:25.741 --> 30:27.598
She snuck a bomb in here.

30:32.373 --> 30:33.838
Why would Magpie bomb the museum?

30:33.841 --> 30:35.375
She's not. It's a Trojan horse.

30:35.378 --> 30:36.980
Use the explosion in the
showroom as a distraction,

30:36.982 --> 30:39.052
and she'll have free rein
over the exhibit room.

30:41.327 --> 30:45.087
The Wayne family has
been a hallmark to Gotham,

30:45.090 --> 30:48.435
and their legacy lives on even today.

31:00.991 --> 31:02.979
Okay. Ladies and gentlemen,

31:02.982 --> 31:06.236
it looks like we have a
little situation on our hands.

31:06.239 --> 31:09.022
Everyone, please
move towards the exit.

31:18.008 --> 31:22.010
Everyone, calmly towards the exit.

31:26.058 --> 31:28.434
Ha ha ha ha!

31:34.504 --> 31:36.912
I'm not meant to be a jailbird.

31:36.915 --> 31:39.144
Looks like you have a choice to make.

31:39.146 --> 31:41.053
The shiny jewels are all insured,

31:41.056 --> 31:43.431
but those sitting ducks
only have one life.

31:43.433 --> 31:47.911
Heh heh. Which are you gonna save?

31:47.913 --> 31:49.570
Ha ha ha!

32:08.330 --> 32:10.122
Ha ha ha!

32:13.582 --> 32:15.303
Ha! Ha ha!

32:27.806 --> 32:29.773
Ha ha ha!

32:35.318 --> 32:38.378
Mommy, I found a marble.

32:49.475 --> 32:53.293
Whoa. It's really you.

33:09.029 --> 33:11.080
It's over.

33:26.714 --> 33:29.306
I've seen you before.
You're the photographer.

33:29.309 --> 33:32.854
You weren't just taking photos at
Wayne Tower. You were casing it.

33:32.857 --> 33:35.362
People like you never
notice people like me.

33:35.364 --> 33:37.906
You put a lot of lives
in danger tonight.

33:37.908 --> 33:40.384
Well, some of us don't
have the privilege

33:40.386 --> 33:42.555
of sitting in our tower, having angst

33:42.558 --> 33:46.390
about what to do with
our lives, Miss Kane.

33:46.392 --> 33:50.469
They just do it to survive.

33:50.471 --> 33:53.147
Time to go to Blackgate, Margot.

33:59.712 --> 34:01.480
Hey. Did you see that?

34:01.482 --> 34:03.855
I didn't. I was on... a call.

34:03.858 --> 34:05.743
Batwoman showed up. It was surreal.

34:05.745 --> 34:07.244
I tried calling you.

34:07.246 --> 34:10.688
I must have been in a dead zone.

34:10.690 --> 34:14.018
You just said you were on a call.

34:14.022 --> 34:16.755
I did. I...

34:16.757 --> 34:21.094
So... here's why this sucks.

34:21.097 --> 34:22.951
I like you.

34:22.953 --> 34:26.672
You're funny, you're cool,

34:26.674 --> 34:29.174
but that's not really enough.

34:29.176 --> 34:31.117
I'm not a needy person, Kate,

34:31.120 --> 34:32.996
but if I'm gonna make an effort,

34:33.000 --> 34:38.108
miss a spin class or
rearrange a work shift,

34:38.110 --> 34:42.571
all I ask for is a little honesty.

34:43.899 --> 34:46.116
Here's why this sucks.

34:46.119 --> 34:48.599
I think you're fun and cool

34:48.601 --> 34:51.831
and seem to care about
all the right things...

34:53.984 --> 34:56.815
But I'm not in a place right now

34:56.819 --> 35:00.297
where I can share all of
myself with someone else.

35:04.971 --> 35:08.663
I am sorry.

35:08.665 --> 35:11.124
I get it.

35:11.126 --> 35:14.311
You obviously have a lot going on.

35:15.723 --> 35:17.770
I just hope whatever it is

35:17.773 --> 35:19.832
makes you happy.

35:41.540 --> 35:45.718
Well... this is a nice surprise.

35:48.497 --> 35:51.256
Sweetheart, you okay?

35:51.258 --> 35:53.458
Alice came to me today.

35:53.460 --> 35:56.595
She... she came to
you? Are you all right?

35:56.597 --> 36:00.507
Yeah, I'm fine. She didn't hurt me.

36:00.509 --> 36:02.676
She wants something.

36:02.678 --> 36:04.361
Hamilton is developing a new project,

36:04.363 --> 36:07.004
and Alice has taken interest.

36:07.007 --> 36:08.473
Well, what?

36:08.476 --> 36:12.069
It doesn't matter. I
refuse to put any weapon

36:12.072 --> 36:14.187
into the hands of a terrorist.

36:15.449 --> 36:18.584
Don't answer that. It could be her.

36:18.586 --> 36:20.544
Well, if it's her, I should get it.

36:20.546 --> 36:23.863
Jacob, please.

36:23.865 --> 36:26.959
You should hear this from me.

36:26.961 --> 36:30.974
Sweetheart, what's going on?

36:30.977 --> 36:32.852
It was years ago.

36:35.752 --> 36:38.420
I thought it was the right thing to do.

36:38.422 --> 36:42.132
You thought what was
the right thing to do?

36:42.134 --> 36:45.811
You and Kate wouldn't stop looking.

36:45.813 --> 36:47.523
Kate was up all night.

36:47.526 --> 36:49.784
She wasn't going to school,

36:49.787 --> 36:51.408
she was refusing to eat.

36:51.410 --> 36:53.410
She wouldn't give up, and she wasn't

36:53.412 --> 36:54.894
living her life,

36:54.896 --> 36:58.148
and the more despair that she felt,

36:58.150 --> 37:01.109
the more broken you became.

37:01.111 --> 37:02.777
What did you do, Catherine?

37:02.779 --> 37:07.091
You were both in a
downward spiral, Jacob.

37:07.093 --> 37:12.096
You never would have
moved on if you didn't...

37:12.098 --> 37:15.766
Think that Beth were dead.

37:15.768 --> 37:19.103
They found bones,

37:19.105 --> 37:20.795
skull fragments.

37:20.797 --> 37:25.467
Hamilton Employees found bones

37:25.469 --> 37:27.444
from a deer.

37:29.806 --> 37:35.027
I paid the DNA analyst
to write the report.

37:35.029 --> 37:37.731
The police, my investigators,

37:37.734 --> 37:40.815
the entire city had been
looking and looking for Beth

37:40.818 --> 37:43.777
without finding so
much as a sock, Jacob.

37:43.779 --> 37:46.946
- She was gone.
- Stop.

37:46.948 --> 37:49.811
Get away from me.

37:49.814 --> 37:52.159
Just...

37:52.162 --> 37:54.753
Just get away from me.

38:11.973 --> 38:14.906
You... have to stop doing that.

38:14.909 --> 38:17.602
Sudden adrenaline release
can lead to cardiac arrest,

38:17.604 --> 38:18.820
and I am way too busy to have

38:18.822 --> 38:21.040
a heart condition right now.

38:21.042 --> 38:22.821
You fixed him?

38:22.824 --> 38:24.484
He's stable.

38:24.486 --> 38:27.028
An hour later, and may
not have been able to.

38:27.030 --> 38:31.074
You were right. I shouldn't
have let him get this bad.

38:31.076 --> 38:33.701
Yeah. So on that topic,

38:33.703 --> 38:35.867
I may have prodded him a little

38:35.870 --> 38:38.137
while he was under a morphine haze.

38:38.140 --> 38:40.778
I know, but he ruined
my favorite plaid shirt

38:40.781 --> 38:42.669
when he stabbed me,

38:42.671 --> 38:47.549
so my point is Alice
is looking for a mouse

38:47.551 --> 38:49.601
or someone named Mouse.

38:49.603 --> 38:51.262
He said Mouse,

38:51.265 --> 38:54.773
and she has big plans for him.

38:54.775 --> 38:58.660
So thought you should know.

38:58.662 --> 39:00.654
Ooh. Ooh, ooh! Whoa!

39:00.656 --> 39:03.707
Whoa! Hang on! You can't just... gah!

39:03.709 --> 39:05.526
What is that?!

39:05.529 --> 39:07.169
Subdermal transponder.

39:07.171 --> 39:09.027
- A what?
- Chipped him.

39:09.030 --> 39:11.623
He leads me to Alice, I
figure out who Mouse is.

39:11.625 --> 39:14.292
Oh, okay. Okay.

39:14.294 --> 39:16.512
Good work, Mary.

39:17.747 --> 39:19.131
Thank you.

39:44.834 --> 39:49.068
The bomb-loving
bird is finally in a cage,

39:49.070 --> 39:50.236
where she belongs.

39:50.238 --> 39:52.346
Batwoman clipped her wings,

39:52.349 --> 39:54.400
and she wasn't very
sweet about it either.

39:54.403 --> 39:58.062
Hey, Batwoman. You
have such a pretty face.

39:58.065 --> 40:00.455
Ever think about smiling more?

40:00.457 --> 40:02.425
Another win in the Batcolumn.

40:02.428 --> 40:05.334
Almost got a compliment out
of Vesper Fairchild, too.

40:05.337 --> 40:07.253
I reunited a bunch of
billionaires with things

40:07.256 --> 40:08.461
they probably didn't miss.

40:08.464 --> 40:10.314
You also saved a lot of innocent lives.

40:10.317 --> 40:12.074
The city trusts you now.

40:12.077 --> 40:15.112
They trust Batwoman. Kate
Kane is a different story.

40:15.114 --> 40:17.439
What do you know about real estate?

40:17.441 --> 40:19.239
Um, everyone hates popcorn ceilings.

40:19.242 --> 40:20.884
So more than me.

40:20.887 --> 40:23.360
I'm starting a real estate firm.

40:23.363 --> 40:26.049
Okay. So the last thing the city needs

40:26.052 --> 40:28.525
is another predatory developer
cluttering the skyline.

40:28.528 --> 40:31.444
I agree. That's why I want
to buy run-down buildings

40:31.446 --> 40:33.205
from outside the Crows districts,

40:33.207 --> 40:34.314
keep the rents low,

40:34.316 --> 40:35.916
and give them back to the community.

40:35.919 --> 40:37.374
So Bruce was a billionaire playboy,

40:37.377 --> 40:39.220
and you're gonna be
who... Joanna Gaines?

40:39.223 --> 40:41.201
- You can be chip.
- I just told you

40:41.204 --> 40:42.613
I don't know anything about real estate.

40:42.615 --> 40:43.715
Well, you better learn quick because

40:43.717 --> 40:44.999
you're gonna be my assistant.

40:45.001 --> 40:48.020
- Associate.
- Hmm. Up for debate.

40:50.632 --> 40:54.175
Dear Bruce,
Queen Rihanna was right.

40:54.177 --> 40:56.970
Lies don't make anyone comfortable,

40:56.972 --> 40:59.472
especially the one telling them,

40:59.474 --> 41:03.778
but no one said anything about
this job being comfortable.

41:08.041 --> 41:09.925
If I'm going to embrace the Bat,

41:09.928 --> 41:13.119
then I'm going to have to
embrace hiding a part of myself

41:13.122 --> 41:14.913
from the outside world.

41:14.916 --> 41:18.026
Living this double life is a sacrifice...

41:19.511 --> 41:21.368
But our city is worth it.
