06:35.482 --> 06:36.744

07:01.769 --> 07:03.248

07:03.292 --> 07:05.120
you're under surveillance--
audio and video.

07:05.163 --> 07:06.600
Video, I got you, no problem.
Audio's a little trickier.

07:06.643 --> 07:08.428
There's microphones
all over this ship,

07:08.471 --> 07:10.995
so even if I were to loop
the audio in the armory,

07:11.039 --> 07:13.171
the mics in the hallway
will still pick you up.

07:13.215 --> 07:14.738
You gotta stay silent.

07:14.782 --> 07:16.827
Okay, but what happens
if I'm not?

07:16.871 --> 07:18.655
Well, once you're past
the bulkhead,

07:18.699 --> 07:20.222
she can open the airlock

07:20.265 --> 07:22.050

without harming our Gideon.

07:22.093 --> 07:23.486
Okay, good, and one fart,

07:23.530 --> 07:25.009

07:25.053 --> 07:26.271
You're not gonna fart,
and when you come back

07:26.315 --> 07:27.795

Astra, you're up.

07:27.838 --> 07:29.231

07:34.889 --> 07:35.846
