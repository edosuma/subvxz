10:13.360 --> 10:15.650
[JAKE] PLEASE CALL ME JAKE,

BRIAN HARRIS ASSAULT.

10:18.280 --> 10:19.780

[LESLIE] EXCUSE ME?
[JAKE] YOU WERE JUST...

10:29.710 --> 10:31.920

10:31.960 --> 10:35.630
NO? DID YOU SEE THAT?

10:35.670 --> 10:37.380
OKAY YOU WEREN'T CHECKING ME
OUT.

10:37.430 --> 10:38.970
ALL RIGHT, OKAY.

10:39.010 --> 10:42.760
THIS CASE ITS LIKE A FAMILY
FAVOUR TYPE THING, AND I WOULD

10:42.810 --> 10:45.520
REALLY APPRECIATE IF I COULD
TALK TO MRS. HARRIS FOR A FEW

10:45.560 --> 10:48.270
MINUTES, MAYBE?

10:48.310 --> 10:50.190
3 MINUTES IS ALL I NEED.

10:50.230 --> 10:52.150
[LESLIE] SOMEHOW THAT DOESN'T
SURPRISE ME.

10:52.190 --> 10:56.190
3 MINUTES STARTING NOW.

10:56.240 --> 10:58.280
[JAKE] THANK YOU.

11:03.030 --> 11:09.710
[JAKE] HI, THERESA HARRIS?

11:09.750 --> 11:10.920
I'M REALLY ABOUT THIS.

11:10.960 --> 11:12.880
DO YOU MIND IF I...

11:12.920 --> 11:14.750
MY NAME IS JAKE DOYLE.

11:14.800 --> 11:16.010
I'M A PRIVATE DETECTIVE.

11:16.050 --> 11:18.800
I WAS HIRED BY BENNY NATCHE'S
FATHER.

11:18.840 --> 11:20.260
[THERESA] FOR BENNY.

11:20.300 --> 11:21.760
[JAKE] I KNOW THIS IS REALLY
INAPPROPRIATE, AND YOU'RE

11:21.800 --> 11:24.180
PROBABLY GONNA CALL THE COPS
ON ME AND THEY'RE GONNA THROW

11:24.220 --> 11:26.350
ME OUT. BUT DO YOU MIND IF
I ASK YOU A COUPLE OF

11:26.390 --> 11:29.560
QUESTIONS? PLEASE?

11:29.600 --> 11:35.320
[THERESA] YEAH, I GUESS.
[JAKE] THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

11:35.360 --> 11:37.400
SORRY.

11:37.440 --> 11:42.950
LOOK I DON'T THINK THAT BENNY
DID THIS TO YOUR HUSBAND.

11:42.990 --> 11:44.910
ALL RIGHT SURE MAYBE THEY WERE
HIGH AND MAYBE THEY HAD A

11:44.950 --> 11:47.330
FIGHT, BUT BENNY IS NOT
CAPABLE OF THIS.

11:47.370 --> 11:49.040
[THERESA] THE POLICE SAY IT
WAS BENNY.

11:49.080 --> 11:52.920
[JAKE] I KNOW, I JUST...
CAN YOU THINK OF ANYONE,

11:52.960 --> 11:55.590
ANYONE AT ALL
THAT MIGHT HAVE HAD A GRUDGE
AGAINST YOUR HUSBAND?

11:55.630 --> 12:00.510
MAYBE WANTED TO HURT HIM?
[THERESA] BRIAN...

12:00.550 --> 12:01.720
PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND HIM.

12:01.760 --> 12:05.850
THEY THINK HE'S JUST SOME
MUSCLE HEAD.

12:05.890 --> 12:09.390
BUT IF YOU KNOW HIM...

12:09.430 --> 12:12.140
I'M SORRY THIS ISN'T SUCH A
GOOD IDEA.

12:12.190 --> 12:14.480
[JAKE] LOOK THERESA, WE'RE
JUST TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT

12:14.520 --> 12:16.770
THE RIGHT PERSON RESPONSIBLE
GOES TO JAIL FOR THIS.

12:16.820 --> 12:18.400
YOU KNOW?

12:18.440 --> 12:19.820
[THERESA] I'M SORRY.

12:24.990 --> 12:26.370
[LAURA] WHO ARE YOU?

12:28.370 --> 12:30.870
[JAKE] MY NAME IS JAKE DOYLE,
I'M A PRIVATE DETECTIVE.

12:30.910 --> 12:32.460
IS SHE GOING TO BE OKAY?

12:32.500 --> 12:34.000
[LAURA] BESIDES THE FACT THAT
HER HUSBAND IS LYING THERE IN

12:34.040 --> 12:36.380
A COMA, AND THAT SHE'S THREE
MONTHS PREGNANT? SHE'S FINE.

12:36.420 --> 12:38.050
[JAKE] SHE'S THREE MONTHS
PREGNANT?

12:38.090 --> 12:39.550
[LAURA] A PRIVATE DETECTIVE?

12:39.590 --> 12:41.590
WHAT DO YOU WANT?
[JAKE] I WAS JUST--

12:41.630 --> 12:43.970
OH MY GOD, YOU'RE LAURA DAWE,
RIGHT? YOU'RE HIS BUSINESS

12:44.010 --> 12:44.640
PARTNER?

12:44.680 --> 12:45.800
[LAURA] YES.

12:45.840 --> 12:47.010
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

12:47.050 --> 12:50.020
[JAKE] I WAS JUST ASKING YOUR
SISTER IF SHE KNEW OF ANYONE

12:50.060 --> 12:52.810
THAT MAYBE WANTED TO HURT
BRIAN.

12:52.850 --> 12:55.350
[LAURA] YEAH, BENNY NATCHE,
THE GUY WHO DID THIS TO HIM.

12:55.400 --> 12:56.360
CREEP, GO. GO!

12:56.400 --> 12:59.980
[JAKE] I'M GOING.
LOOK, I'M SORRY.

13:00.030 --> 13:01.530
IF YOU THINK OF ANYTHING,
ANYTHING AT ALL.

13:01.570 --> 13:03.950
MY NUMBER'S...

13:03.990 --> 13:05.700
OKAY.

13:05.990 --> 13:08.990
&lt;♪♪&gt;

13:17.210 --> 13:19.000
[MALACHY] LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING
TO BE QUITE THE PARTY, HUH?

13:19.040 --> 13:20.340
[TOM] YOU KNOWS IT, DAWG.

13:20.380 --> 13:21.800
YOU WANT TO PIMP YOUR HOME
ENTERTAINMENT CENTRE?

13:21.840 --> 13:24.590
[MALACHY] I DON'T NEED ANY
SPEAKERS, THANK YOU...

13:24.630 --> 13:26.390
TOM.

13:26.430 --> 13:28.010
YOU ARE THE DJ

13:28.050 --> 13:30.010
[TOM] YOU WITH
THE COMPENSATION BOARD?

13:30.060 --> 13:32.060
[MALACHY] I'M NOT HERE ABOUT
ANY INSURANCE CLAIM, EITHER.

13:32.100 --> 13:35.940
BUT, I CAN BE. SO YOU'D BETTER
BE ANSWERING SOME QUESTIONS.

13:35.980 --> 13:37.560
[TOM] LIKE WHAT?
[MALACHY] WHAT HAPPENED ON THE

13:37.610 --> 13:39.820
BOAT BETWEEN BRIAN HARRIS AND
BENNY NATCHE?

13:39.860 --> 13:40.400
[TOM] NO.

13:40.440 --> 13:42.110
I ALREADY TOLD THE COPS.

13:42.150 --> 13:44.450
[MALACHY] I'VE GOT PICTURES OF
YOU LUGGING THEM BOXES.

13:44.490 --> 13:45.860
[TOM] ALL RIGHT!

13:48.990 --> 13:51.660
BRIAN AND BENNY WERE SCRAPPIN'.

13:51.700 --> 13:54.250
THEY WAS ALWAYS SCRAPPIN'.

13:54.290 --> 13:56.330
[MALACHY] WHAT WERE THEY
FIGHTING ABOUT? DRUGS?

13:56.370 --> 13:59.000
[TOM] ALL'S I KNOW IS...

13:59.040 --> 14:00.630
BRIAN HEADS OFF THE BOAT.

14:00.670 --> 14:02.960
A BIT LATER BENNY TAKES OFF
TOO.

14:03.010 --> 14:06.090
NEXT THING I KNOWS IS,
FIVE OH'S IS EVERYWHERE.

14:06.130 --> 14:07.680
[MALACHY] ANYONE OTHER THAN
BENNY HAVE PROBLEMS WITH

14:07.720 --> 14:11.680
BRIAN?
[TOM] HERE AND THERE.

14:11.720 --> 14:13.850
I HEARD HE RAN INTO SOME STATIC
OUT WEST.

14:13.890 --> 14:16.690
[MALACHY] OUT WEST?
[TOM] ALBERTA BABY.

14:16.730 --> 14:18.730
THAT'S WHY HE CAME BACK.
[MALACHY] WHAT'S YOUR DAY JOB,

14:18.770 --> 14:21.690
TOM? HUH?

14:21.730 --> 14:24.110

AREN'T YOU?

14:24.150 --> 14:25.690
[TOM] NAH, MAN.

14:25.740 --> 14:27.990
BANK TELLER.

14:28.030 --> 14:29.570
[MALACHY] I'LL JUST
HANG ON TO THESE.

14:29.620 --> 14:32.620
IN CASE I HAVE SOME MORE
QUESTIONS. PEACE MAN!

14:33.120 --> 14:35.870

15:15.540 --> 15:17.160
I DIDN'T TOUCH HIM.

GONNA HANDLE THIS.

15:25.420 --> 15:27.920

WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

15:32.180 --> 15:34.300
[JAKE] LOOK, I DIDN'T COME HERE

15:34.350 --> 15:35.430
THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH US.

15:35.470 --> 15:37.060
[NIKKI] WHO SAID THIS HAS
ANYTHING TO DO WITH US?

15:37.100 --> 15:38.430
I'M AT WORK JAKE.

15:38.470 --> 15:39.980
YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO BE HERE
AT MY PLACE OF WORK.

15:40.020 --> 15:42.310
[JAKE] LOOK I'M WORKING TOO
OKAY? I'M ON A CASE.

15:42.350 --> 15:44.270
I JUST NEED TO KNOW WHAT
HAPPENED TO THE DEAD GUY
IN THERE.

15:44.310 --> 15:45.610
[NIKKI] I'M A DOCTOR,
IT'S CONFIDENTIAL.

15:45.650 --> 15:47.400
EVEN IF I WANTED TO IT'S A
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION.

15:47.440 --> 15:49.570
[JAKE] WOULD YOU STOP BEING SO
FRIGGIN' DRAMATIC?

15:49.610 --> 15:50.740
[MALACHY] HEY JAKE?

15:50.780 --> 15:53.160

15:53.200 --> 15:54.410

16:02.790 --> 16:04.630
[MALACHY] LOOK, I KNOW
YOU REALLY SHOULDN'T.

16:04.670 --> 16:09.210
BUT IT'D BE GOOD TO KNOW.

16:09.260 --> 16:10.220
[NIKKI] SUBDURAL HEMATOMA.

16:10.260 --> 16:12.380
HE CRASHED, THERE WAS NOTHING
WE COULD DO.

16:12.430 --> 16:15.600
[MALACHY] THANK YOU AND FOR
THE RECORD, YOU MADE HIM

16:15.640 --> 16:20.140
A BETTER PERSON. SEE YAH.

16:20.180 --> 16:22.100
[NIKKI] SEE YAH.

16:22.140 --> 16:23.980
[MALACHY] WHY DO YOU HAVE
TO AGGRAVATE THAT POOR GIRL?

16:24.020 --> 16:25.980
[JAKE] I WASN'T AGGRAVATING
ANYONE, ALL RIGHT?

16:26.020 --> 16:29.030
[MALACHY] LOOK THE CAUSE OF
DEATH WAS THE BRAIN TRAUMA

16:29.070 --> 16:30.440
SUSTAINED IN THE ATTACK.

16:30.490 --> 16:32.150
WHAT DID YOU FIND OUT?
[JAKE] THE WIFE'S A MESS,

16:32.200 --> 16:34.910
THE SISTER'S A HEAD CASE, AND
THERE IS COPS HERE EVERYWHERE.

16:34.950 --> 16:38.200
[MALACHY] BENNY'S GOING TO BE
ON THE HOOK FOR A MANSLAUGHTER
CHARGE AT THE VERY LEAST.

16:38.240 --> 16:40.910
[JAKE] YEAH, I'M THINKING
THERE IS A LOT MORE
THAN THAT GOING ON.

16:40.950 --> 16:43.330
IT'S GOTTA BE CONNECTED TO
THOSE DRUGS ON THE PARTY BOAT.

16:44.420 --> 16:46.040
NOW LOOK,

16:47.170 --> 16:49.210
NOTHING SAYS HOME LIKE THE
ALBERTA LIKE A COWBOY HAT,

16:49.250 --> 16:50.960
DOES IT? WHAT DO MAKE OF THAT?

16:51.010 --> 16:53.260
[MALACHY] INTERESTING. THAT
OTHER DJ FROM THE BOAT SAID

16:53.300 --> 16:55.470
BRIAN HAD SOME TROUBLES
BACK IN ALBERTA.

16:55.510 --> 16:57.930
[JAKE] MAYBE THOSE TROUBLES
CAME HOME TO FIND HIM. I'LL

16:57.970 --> 16:59.560
TAKE A SNAP, E-MAIL T TO ROSE.

16:59.600 --> 17:02.100
SHE CAN RUN A DMV CHECK FOR US.

17:02.140 --> 17:03.850
[MALACHY] OKAY.

17:03.890 --> 17:06.020

17:16.160 --> 17:17.490

GRANDFATHER. YOU PROBABLY

17:35.260 --> 17:37.550
OKAY. FINE IF YOU CAN'T HEAR ME
I MIGHT AS WELL BE STRAIGHT WITH

17:37.590 --> 17:40.260
YOU. I DIDN'T MOVE INTO THIS
HOUSE EXPECTING TO BABYSIT A 16

17:40.310 --> 17:42.140
YEAR OLD BRAT. SO KEEP IT UP.

17:42.180 --> 17:44.020
KEEP IT UP WITH THE ATTITUDE!

17:44.060 --> 17:45.850
ONE NIGHT I'LL SNEAK INTO YOUR
ROOM WHILE YOU'RE SLEEPING AND

17:45.890 --> 17:47.940
RING YOUR BLOODY NECK.

17:47.980 --> 17:49.980
[TINNY] IT WASN'T TURNED
ON YET.

17:52.150 --> 17:53.780
[ROSE] GOOD.

17:53.820 --> 17:58.320
[JAKE] BRIAN IS DEAD.
YOU'RE GOING TO GO AWAY FOR
MANSLAUGHTER.

17:58.370 --> 17:59.910
[BENNY] HE'S DEAD?

17:59.950 --> 18:01.330
ARE YOU SURE?
[JAKE] YEAH.

18:01.370 --> 18:04.450
[MALACHY] YOU NEED ANOTHER
LAWYER, SON.

18:04.500 --> 18:06.710
[JAKE] YOU SURE IT WAS ECSTASY
YOU WERE ON THAT NIGHT, BENNY?

18:06.750 --> 18:08.380
[BENNY] YOU LECTURING ME ON MY
DRUG USE NOW?

18:08.420 --> 18:10.290
[JAKE] NO I'M NOT LECTURING
YOU ON YOUR DRUG USE.

18:10.340 --> 18:12.960
BUT I KNOW NO ONE DOES
ECSTASY AND KILLS A GUY.

18:13.010 --> 18:15.840
[BENNY] JUST STOP
WITH THIS NOW OKAY?

18:15.880 --> 18:17.630
I GOT NOTHING ELSE TO SAY.
I TOLD YOU ALREADY.

18:17.680 --> 18:20.470
[MALACHY] THERE'S A LOT OF COPS
AT THE HOSPITAL. WHY?

18:20.510 --> 18:22.760
[JAKE] WE KNOW THERE IS MORE
GOING ON HERE THAN THIS ASSAULT.

18:22.810 --> 18:24.600
[BENNY] STOP.

18:24.640 --> 18:26.310
JUST STOP IT.

18:26.350 --> 18:27.850
[JAKE] WHO ARE THESE GUYS?

18:27.900 --> 18:29.310
WHO ARE THEY? BENNY.

18:29.350 --> 18:32.360
[BENNY] I DON'T KNOW.
[JAKE] ARE THEY CONNECTED?

18:32.400 --> 18:34.150
ARE THEY CONNECTED?!

18:36.950 --> 18:39.320
BENNY YOU KNOW WHAT,
I AM GOING TO FIND OUT
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

18:39.360 --> 18:41.120
I JUST HOPE IT'S
NOT TOO LATE WHEN I DO.

18:48.370 --> 18:50.170
[REG] BUZZ, YOU ONLY GET ONE
SECOND WITH THIS SIGN-IN BOOK.

18:50.210 --> 18:51.380

18:51.420 --> 18:52.460
[MALACHY] THANKS, REG.

18:52.500 --> 18:53.880
[JAKE] YEAH,
WE APPRECIATE IT BUDDY.

18:53.920 --> 18:56.550
[REG] HEY. NOBODY KNOWS ABOUT
THIS GOT ME? MALACHY?

18:56.590 --> 18:59.380
[MALACHY] OKAY REG.

18:59.430 --> 19:00.680
[JAKE] WHAT ARE YOU THINKING,
BENNY'S SCARED?

19:00.720 --> 19:01.930
SOMEONE TRYING TO
THREATEN HIM MAYBE?

19:01.970 --> 19:03.350
[MALACHY] WHAT? THE COWBOYS?

19:03.390 --> 19:06.560
LET'S SEE IF THEY'VE
PAID HIM A VISIT.

19:06.600 --> 19:07.810
LAURA DAWE,

19:07.850 --> 19:09.520
BRIAN'S SISTER-IN-LAW IS
VISITING BENNY IN JAIL.

19:09.560 --> 19:11.020
[JAKE] YOU SURE?

19:11.060 --> 19:12.190
[MALACHY] YES, MY SON, THAT'S
HER NAME RIGHT THERE. SEE?

19:12.230 --> 19:13.360
READING, IT'S A MARVELOUS THING.

19:13.400 --> 19:19.320
SHOULD TRY IT SOME TIME.

19:19.360 --> 19:20.820
COULD HAVE A LOOK AT THE
SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE?

19:20.860 --> 19:23.030
[JAKE] FOR THIS DAY.

19:23.080 --> 19:26.790
[REG] WHAT ARE YOU, ON GLUE?
[MALACHY] MAYBE NOT.

19:26.830 --> 19:28.330
[JAKE] THANKS REG FOR YOUR
HELP.

19:28.370 --> 19:30.420
[REG] DOYLE, NEXT TIME I SEE
YOU AT THE GOULDS TRACK,

19:30.460 --> 19:31.960
WALK THE OTHER WAY.

19:32.000 --> 19:32.830
[JAKE] I'LL BE WALKING...

19:32.880 --> 19:35.380
THE OTHER... WAY.

19:35.420 --> 19:38.970
[MALACHY] WHY WOULD LAURA BE
COMING TO VISIT THE GUY WHO
KILLED HER SISTER'S HUSBAND?

19:39.010 --> 19:41.010
[JAKE] I DON'T KNOW,
LETS GO ASK HER.

19:41.510 --> 19:43.390
[MALACHY] SEE YOU REG.

19:43.430 --> 19:46.180
&lt;♪♪&gt;

19:50.440 --> 19:53.230
[MALACHY] SHALL WE?
[JAKE] MIGHT AS WELL.

19:53.270 --> 19:54.650
HELLO?

19:55.480 --> 19:56.860
[MALACHY] LAURA?

19:58.530 --> 20:00.150
LAURA DAWE?

20:03.910 --> 20:06.830
[JAKE] I LOVE WHAT SHE'S DONE
WITH THE PLACE.

20:06.870 --> 20:09.080
[MALACHY] UNLESS WE FIND A
DEAD CLEANING LADY SOMEWHERE

20:09.120 --> 20:12.670
IN HERE, I'D SAY THIS LOOKS
PRETTY SUSPICIOUS.

20:12.710 --> 20:16.250
[JAKE] THERE IS AN ASTUTE
OBSERVATION THERE BANACHEK.

20:16.290 --> 20:18.420
OH LOOK AT THIS.

20:18.460 --> 20:19.050
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

20:19.090 --> 20:21.470
USING THE SCALE FOR BAKING?

20:21.510 --> 20:23.720
BIG DOUBTERS THERE.

20:23.760 --> 20:27.810
LOOKS TO ME... LIKE BRIAN AND
LAURA ARE SUPPLYING THE BOAT AND

20:27.850 --> 20:29.310
THE PARTY.

20:29.350 --> 20:31.350
[MALACHY] I'LL GO HAVE A LOOK
AROUND.

20:31.390 --> 20:33.980
[JAKE] YOU DO THAT.

20:34.020 --> 20:37.400
YEAH, THERE'S COKE IN THIS DAD,
FOR SURE.

20:42.530 --> 20:44.240
BIG GYM.

20:44.280 --> 20:45.490
WELL, YOU COULD LIFT BRIAN.

20:45.530 --> 20:47.160
&lt;GLASS BREAKING&gt;

20:48.490 --> 20:49.450
[JAKE] DAD?

20:51.460 --> 20:52.710
WHAT HAPPENED?

20:52.750 --> 20:54.790
[MALACHY] WINDOW.
HE WENT THROUGH THE WINDOW.

20:54.830 --> 20:55.960
[JAKE] &lt;O.S&gt; WAS HE LIKE A...

20:56.000 --> 20:56.630
A BEARDED GUY?

20:56.670 --> 20:57.880
COWBOY LOOKING FELLA?

20:57.920 --> 20:59.460
[MALACHY] IT'S NOT LIKE
HE WAS WEARING THE HAT.

20:59.500 --> 21:00.590
[JAKE] DO YOU WANT
MY HELP OR NOT?

21:00.630 --> 21:01.590
[MALACHY] I'D RATHER CRAWL.

21:01.630 --> 21:02.970
[LAURA] WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?!

21:03.010 --> 21:06.390
[JAKE] HE'S FALLEN
AND HE CAN'T GET UP.

21:09.600 --> 21:11.180
[LAURA] I'M CALLING THE POLICE.

21:11.220 --> 21:13.640
[MALACHY] YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE
AT THAT. HOLD ON.

21:13.690 --> 21:15.150
[JAKE] NO, GO RIGHT AHEAD.

21:15.190 --> 21:16.810
CALL 'EM.

21:16.860 --> 21:19.110
SOMEBODY FENG SHUI-ED
THIS PLACE PRETTY GOOD, RIGHT?

21:19.150 --> 21:21.530
I'M GUESSING IT HAS SOMETHING
TO DO WITH THE PARTY FAVOURS?

21:21.570 --> 21:23.360
YOU AND BRIAN HAVE BEEN SELLING
SOME COKE ON THAT BOAT.

21:23.400 --> 21:25.490
SO I'LL JUST TAKE A LITTLE
PICTURES YOU CALL THE COPS,

21:25.530 --> 21:29.080
THEY'LL STRAIGHTEN
THE WHOLE THING OUT.

21:29.120 --> 21:30.450
[LAURA] THE ONLY PEOPLE
I SEE HERE ARE YOU TWO.

21:30.490 --> 21:32.290
SO FOR ALL I KNOW,
YOU TRASHED THE PLACE.

21:32.330 --> 21:36.460
[JAKE] IF YOU REALLY THOUGHT
THAT, YOU WOULD BE CALLING
THE COPS RIGHT NOW.

21:36.500 --> 21:39.590
[MALACHY] I'M MALACHY DOYLE
I'M A PRIVATE DETECTIVE
AND THIS IS MY SON JAKE.

21:39.630 --> 21:41.500
[JAKE] WE MET AT THE HOSPITAL.

21:41.550 --> 21:44.510
[MALACHY] WE'RE INVESTIGATING
BRIAN HARRIS' DEATH
AND YOUR DOOR WAS OPEN.

21:44.550 --> 21:45.720
[JAKE] THAT'S RIGHT.

21:45.760 --> 21:48.180
WHY WERE YOU VISITING
BENNY NATCHE IN PRISON?

21:48.220 --> 21:50.390
[LAURA] WHAT?
[MALACHY] IT JUST SEEMS ODD

21:50.430 --> 21:53.680
YOU WOULD VISIT HIM AFTER HE
PUT YOUR BUSINESS PARTNER AND
BROTHER-IN-LAW IN HOSPITAL.

21:53.730 --> 21:55.600
[JAKE] WAS BENNY TRYING TO
PROTECT YOU FOR SOMETHING?

21:55.640 --> 21:57.900
MAYBE BECAUSE YOU'RE INVOLVED
HORIZONTALLY?

21:57.940 --> 21:59.820
[LAURA] I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

21:59.860 --> 22:03.900
[MALACHY] HE'S LOOKING AT A
MURDER CHARGE YET REFUSES
TO DEFEND HIMSELF.

22:03.940 --> 22:06.490
THAT'S YOUR SIGNATURE, RIGHT?

22:06.530 --> 22:09.490
[JAKE] COME HAVE A LOOK PLEASE.

22:09.530 --> 22:11.410
WE TOOK THIS FROM THE LOG BOOK
AT THE PRISON.

22:11.450 --> 22:15.330
LOOK FAMILIAR?

22:15.370 --> 22:17.540
[LAURA] HE WORKS FOR ME.

22:17.580 --> 22:18.830
I OWE HIM AT LEAST A VISIT.

22:18.880 --> 22:21.000
[JAKE] CONJUGAL... VISIT?

22:21.040 --> 22:22.500
I DON'T CARE IF YOU WERE
SLEEPING WITH BENNY,

22:22.550 --> 22:24.340
I'M JUST CURIOUS WHY
YOU'RE TRYING TO HIDE IT.

22:24.380 --> 22:26.680
[LAURA] OKAY BRIAN WAS A JERK,
ALL RIGHT? HE RAN THE BUSINESS

22:26.720 --> 22:29.340
UP HIS NOSE AND DOWN INTO THE
GROUND. I DIDN'T KNOW THAT

22:29.390 --> 22:32.260
PEOPLE COMING TO SEE BENNY WAS
THE ONLY THING KEEPING US

22:32.310 --> 22:36.100
AFLOAT FOR MONTHS. SO, I WAS
JUST TRYING TO BE KIND. BUT

22:36.140 --> 22:39.480
BENNY KNOWS WHAT HE DID. NOW,
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, MY LITTLE

22:39.520 --> 22:43.610
SISTER'S BURYING HER HUSBAND.

22:43.650 --> 22:44.990
SO GET OUT.

22:45.030 --> 22:47.900
NOW!

22:47.950 --> 22:49.410
[MALACHY] COME ON.

22:49.450 --> 22:52.450
&lt;♪♪&gt;

22:54.410 --> 22:56.120
[JAKE] WOW, THIS MUST BE FATE.

22:56.160 --> 22:58.290
[LESLIE] WHAT, ARE YOU
FOLLOWING ME NOW?

22:58.330 --> 23:00.710
[JAKE] PLEASE CONSTABLE, I JUST
NEED TEN MINUTES OF YOUR TIME.

23:00.750 --> 23:03.460
LET ME BUY YOU SOME CHIPS?

23:03.500 --> 23:06.840
CAN WE GET TWO CHIPS PLEASE?

23:06.880 --> 23:11.260
[JAKE] WE THINK BENNY WAS
HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH LAURA

23:11.300 --> 23:13.640
DAWE, BRIAN HARRIS'
SISTER-IN-LAW.

23:13.680 --> 23:17.640
SHE IS ALSO CO-OWNER OF THE
PARTY BOAT. YOU GOT ANY SIGNS

23:17.680 --> 23:20.440
OF HER WHEN YOU WERE
INVESTIGATING YOUR DRUG STING

23:20.480 --> 23:22.650
THINGY?
[LESLIE] WHAT DRUG STING

23:22.690 --> 23:24.650
THINGY?
[JAKE] WHAT DRUG STING THINGY?

23:24.690 --> 23:28.450
C'MON! LOOK AT THESE TWO GUYS.

23:28.490 --> 23:30.240
LOOK FAMILIAR?

23:30.280 --> 23:31.490
COWBOY FRIENDS THERE?

23:31.530 --> 23:35.620
I DID SOME RESEARCH TRAVIS LEE
AND JASON WARD.

23:35.660 --> 23:39.750
BOTH THESE GUYS WERE WORKING
WITH BRIAN IN ALBERTA AND BOTH

23:39.790 --> 23:43.000
HAVE RAP SHEETS FOR DRUG
POSSESSION.

23:43.040 --> 23:46.050
[LESLIE] WHAT IS YOUR POINT,
MR. DOYLE?

23:46.090 --> 23:49.630
[JAKE] WOULD YOU PLEASE CALL
ME JAKE? SERIOUSLY.

23:49.670 --> 23:53.470
MY POINT IS I KNOW YOU WERE
INVESTIGATING BRIAN BEFORE HE

23:53.510 --> 23:55.470
GOT HIS HEAD BASHED IN.

23:55.510 --> 23:57.930
AND I THINK THESE GUYS ARE
CONNECTED SOMEHOW.

23:57.970 --> 24:05.690
&lt;JAKE'S CELL RINGS&gt;
MY NIECE LIKES TO RE-PROGRAM

24:05.730 --> 24:08.490
MY RING TONES.

24:08.530 --> 24:10.490
[LESLIE] CUTE.
[JAKE] YEAH, SHE'LL BE DEAD

24:10.530 --> 24:14.370
SOON. I NEED TO KNOW, IS BENNY
HOOKED UP IN ANY OF THIS OR

24:14.410 --> 24:19.120
NOT? PLEASE?
[LESLIE] YOUR FRIEND BENNY WAS

24:19.160 --> 24:20.500
COVERED IN BRIAN HARRIS' BLOOD.

24:20.540 --> 24:22.670
HE WAS HOLDING THE WEAPON IN
HIS HANDS. BUT AS FAR AS

24:22.710 --> 24:27.460
I KNOW, HE HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH ANY DRUGS OR ALBERTA.

24:27.500 --> 24:31.050
[JAKE] SERIOUSLY?
THANK YOU.

24:31.090 --> 24:32.260
[LESLIE] FOR WHAT?

24:32.300 --> 24:34.680
[JAKE] HE'S A VERY CLOSE
PERSONAL FRIEND OF MINE,

24:34.720 --> 24:36.470
AND I APPRECIATE THIS.

24:38.100 --> 24:39.270
THANKS.

24:39.310 --> 24:44.850
&lt;♪♪&gt;

24:44.900 --> 24:46.690
[ROSE] I TALKED WITH
MY CONTACT AT THE PEN.

24:46.730 --> 24:50.650
HE WAS ABLE TO LIFT THIS
SURVEILLANCE PHOTO OF
LAURA SIGNING IN.

24:50.690 --> 24:52.700
THAT'S HER ALL-RIGHT.

24:52.740 --> 24:54.910
[MALACHY] CONTACT?

24:54.950 --> 24:57.080
[ROSE] I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE WITH
CONNECTIONS, MALACHY DOYLE.
HOW COME THERE IS NO SOUND?

24:57.120 --> 24:58.700
[MALACHY] IT ISN'T
SATELLITE TV ROSE.

24:58.740 --> 25:00.540
[ROSE] &lt;READING LIPS&gt;
"LAURA, IT'S THE ONLY WAY.

25:00.580 --> 25:03.210
IT'S THE LEAST HE OWES US."

25:03.250 --> 25:05.540
THAT'S IT.

25:05.580 --> 25:08.460
[MALACHY] WHERE DID YOU LEARN
TO READ LIPS?

25:08.500 --> 25:10.510
[ROSE] I GOT MY OWN MYSTERY.

25:13.130 --> 25:16.140
&lt;♪♪&gt;

25:23.310 --> 25:25.190
[JAKE] SORRY.

25:25.230 --> 25:27.270
SORRY.

25:27.610 --> 25:30.610
&lt;♪♪&gt;

25:34.570 --> 25:36.700
[LESLIE] HOW DID JAKE DOYLE KNOW
ABOUT THESE GUYS BEFORE US?

25:36.740 --> 25:38.120
[PIKE] HE HAS HIS WAYS.

25:38.160 --> 25:39.780
[LESLIE] WE'VE BEEN ON THIS
PARTY BOAT FOR WEEKS,

25:39.830 --> 25:43.160
TRYING TO FIND LAURA DAWE
AND BRIAN HARRIS' SUPPLIERS.

25:43.200 --> 25:45.670
AND A P.I. SHOWS UP
AND KNOWS ALL ABOUT IT?

25:45.710 --> 25:47.750
[PIKE] I DIDN'T SAY A WORD.

25:47.790 --> 25:50.170
[LESLIE] WHAT'S HIS DEAL ANYWAY?
IS HE GONNA BE A PROBLEM?

25:50.210 --> 25:52.590
[PIKE] NAH.
HE WAS A COP BACK IN THE DAY.

25:52.630 --> 25:55.010
UNIFORM DIDN'T FIT,
I DON'T THINK.

25:58.640 --> 26:01.640
&lt;♪♪&gt;

26:10.820 --> 26:13.990
[JAKE] HEY THERE! ANYBODY
SELLING ANY DRUGS?

26:14.030 --> 26:16.740
HOWDY,
JUST LOOKING FOR SOME DRUGS.

26:16.780 --> 26:18.160
[LESLIE] YOU HAVE GOT TO BE
KIDDING ME?

26:18.200 --> 26:19.910
WHAT IS HE DOING HERE?

26:19.950 --> 26:21.870
[PIKE] WHAT DO YOU WANT
TO DO? LOOKS LIKE THE
COWBOYS ARE BAILING.

26:21.910 --> 26:23.120
[LESLIE] LET'S GO, NOW.

26:23.160 --> 26:25.080
[LESLIE] &lt;INTO WALKIE&gt;
EVERYBODY MOVE IN NOW!

26:25.120 --> 26:27.830

26:31.880 --> 26:33.670

26:33.710 --> 26:35.670
[TINNY] UNCLE JAKE, WHAT ARE

26:35.720 --> 26:37.800

26:37.840 --> 26:40.720
[TINNY] "YOUNG LADY?"
[JAKE] YES, YEAH. YOUNG LADY.

26:40.760 --> 26:41.850
[OLDER GUY] YOU WANT
SOMETHING, OLD MAN?

26:41.890 --> 26:44.890
[JAKE] NOT A GOOD TIME TO GO
FULL PLUMAGE, KID.

26:44.930 --> 26:49.400
&lt;POLICE SIRENS&gt;

26:49.440 --> 26:52.730
[LESLIE] NOBODY
LEAVES THIS BOAT.

26:52.770 --> 26:54.780
DON'T MOVE, STAY WHERE YOU ARE.

26:57.240 --> 26:58.740
[LESLIE] NOT GREAT WITH THE
THIRD IMPRESSIONS ARE WE,

26:58.780 --> 27:01.660
JAKE?
[JAKE] YOU KNOW, IF YOU TOLD

27:01.700 --> 27:02.990
ME YOU WERE GONNA BE HERE.

27:03.030 --> 27:04.080
MAYBE I WOULDN'T HAVE COME.
[LESLIE] "TOLD YOU?"

27:04.120 --> 27:05.200
YOU'RE A PRIVATE DETECTIVE.

27:05.250 --> 27:06.580
WHY WOULD I TELL YOU ANYTHING?

27:06.620 --> 27:08.670
WE HAD A VERY HIGH-RISK
OP. PLANNED.

27:08.710 --> 27:10.000
[JAKE] YEAH, I KNOW.

27:10.040 --> 27:11.840
I KNOW YOU WANTED TO BUST THEM
FOR THE DRUG POSSESSION.

27:11.880 --> 27:13.170
BUT THEY DIDN'T HAVE
THE DRUGS ON THEM.

27:13.210 --> 27:14.710
[LESLIE] HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

27:14.750 --> 27:16.840
[JAKE] DID YOU FIND
ANY DRUGS ON THEM?

27:16.880 --> 27:19.010
WELL THEN I REALLY DIDN'T
DO ANYTHING WRONG, DID I?

27:19.050 --> 27:23.930
[LESLIE] STAY OUT OF MY WAY
OR I WILL PUT YOU IN JAIL.

27:23.970 --> 27:30.850
[JAKE] THAT'S A LITTLE
EXCESSIVE CONSTABLE. BUT--

27:30.900 --> 27:32.940
[TINNY] MAN, SHE
NEEDS TO GET LAID.

27:32.980 --> 27:36.030
[JAKE] YOU DON'T EVEN START
WITH ME, NIECE.

27:36.070 --> 27:39.070

28:26.160 --> 28:27.200
[DAVID] SHALL WE PROCEED?

28:27.240 --> 28:29.250
MY CLIENT IS WILLING TO
NEGOTIATE AN EVEN SPLIT

28:29.290 --> 28:30.580
REGARDING THE HOME.

28:30.620 --> 28:32.670
DUE TO THE OBVIOUS MARKET
INCREASE THERE WILL BE

28:32.710 --> 28:34.670
A PROFIT FOR BOTH PARTIES.
[WALTER] WE AGREE IN PRINCIPLE,

28:34.710 --> 28:36.540

FURNISHINGS SHOULD BE DIVIDED

28:38.130 --> 28:40.760
EQUALLY, EXCEPT THE LARGE FLAT
SCREEN TELEVISION--

28:40.800 --> 28:41.930
[JAKE] NO, NO. THAT'S MINE.

28:41.970 --> 28:44.180
YOU KNOW THAT'S MINE.
[WALTER] WE HAVE A LIST OF

28:44.220 --> 28:45.640
DEMANDS.
[NIKKI] "DEMANDS?"

28:45.680 --> 28:47.760
[DAVID] PLEASE. MY CLIENT--
[JAKE] HEY, DON'T TRY IT.

28:47.810 --> 28:49.260
IT'S MINE.

28:49.310 --> 28:52.980
[DAVID] MY CLIENT WILL ALLOW
YOUR CLIENT TO KEEP THE FLAT

28:53.020 --> 28:56.940
SCREEN TELEVISION.
[JAKE] WHAT?

28:56.980 --> 28:58.110
WHY?

28:58.150 --> 28:59.360
[NIKKI] ARE YOU JOKING?
[JAKE] YOU'RE UNBELIEVABLE

28:59.400 --> 28:59.940
YOU KNOW THAT.

28:59.980 --> 29:00.780
I KNOW WHAT THE TV.

29:00.820 --> 29:03.950
[NIKKI] STOP BEING SO CHILDISH.

29:03.990 --> 29:05.990
[JAKE] NO, NO. I KNOW DOING
HERE. YOU'RE PUTTING ON

29:06.030 --> 29:07.330
THIS MANIPULATIVE
SPIN CRAP.

29:07.370 --> 29:08.540
DO YOU SEE WHAT
SHE'S DOING HERE?

29:08.580 --> 29:09.910
SHE'S TRYING TO BE A
MARTYR AREN'T YOU NIKKI?

29:09.950 --> 29:10.910
WELL IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK.

29:10.950 --> 29:11.960
[NIKKI] DO YOU HEAR THIS?

29:12.000 --> 29:13.040
A YEAR. A YEAR OF THIS!

29:13.080 --> 29:15.080
[DAVID] DO I UNDERSTAND THAT
YOUR CLIENT REFUSES TO TAKE

29:15.120 --> 29:17.040
THE TELEVISION?
[NIKKI] OH NO, HE'S TAKING IT.

29:17.090 --> 29:19.420
[DAVID] NIKKI, PLEASE.
[JAKE] YOU WANT ME TO TAKE IT?

29:19.460 --> 29:21.970
I'LL TAKE IT UNDER ONE
CONDITION.

29:22.010 --> 29:23.800
[WALTER] JAKE, YOU WANNA LET
ME HANDLE THIS?

29:23.840 --> 29:25.760
[NIKKI] SHUT UP, WALTER.

29:25.800 --> 29:27.470
WHAT CONDITION?

29:27.510 --> 29:29.720
[JAKE] WE STAY THE HELL
AWAY FROM ONE ANOTHER
FOR EVER AND EVER.

29:30.970 --> 29:33.520
[NIKKI] YOU ARE SUCH A BASTARD!

29:33.560 --> 29:35.440
WE MADE A PROMISE!

29:35.480 --> 29:37.810
WE MADE A PROMISE IN FRONT OF
GOD, JAKE!!

29:37.860 --> 29:39.070
DID YOU FORGET THAT!?

29:39.110 --> 29:41.070
[JAKE] YES! I FORGOT IT BECAUSE
WE WERE DRUNK!

29:41.110 --> 29:42.990
[WALTER] LETS JUST ALL TRY AND
CALM DOWN! SHALL WE?

29:43.030 --> 29:44.860
[JAKE] NO, WALTER!
CAN YOU PLEASE DEAL WITH THIS!

29:44.900 --> 29:46.870
GET ME A RESTRAINING ORDER.

29:46.910 --> 29:48.910
THAT'S WHAT I WANT.
A RESTRAINING ORDER.

29:50.410 --> 29:51.790
CRAZY!

29:57.000 --> 29:58.790
[JAKE] OH MY GOD,
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?

29:58.840 --> 30:00.590
WASH MY EYES OUT WITH ACID?

30:00.630 --> 30:03.920
[ROSE] HOW'D IT GO TODAY?
[JAKE] IT WENT GOOD.

30:03.970 --> 30:06.630
I THINK WE'RE MAKING SOME GOOD
PROGRESS.

30:06.680 --> 30:09.260
[MALACHY] WELL, WE'VE BEEN
DOING A SOME THINKING.

30:09.300 --> 30:11.140
[JAKE] WELL I CAN SEE YOU'RE
THINKING ALL OVER YOUR OLD MAN

30:11.180 --> 30:13.180
LIPS THERE.
[ROSE] YES, WE WERE THINKING

30:13.220 --> 30:15.310
THAT IT'S CLEAR LAURA AND
THERESA ARE HOLDING BACK ON

30:15.350 --> 30:16.600
US.
[MALACHY] SOMEONE TRASHED THE

30:16.640 --> 30:19.060
PLACE, WHICH MEANS THEY HAVE
SOMETHING SOMEONE WANTS.

30:19.110 --> 30:21.860
[JAKE] BUT WHAT THAT SOMETHING
IS, WE HAVE NO IDEA. AND

30:21.900 --> 30:23.940
WHOEVER TRASHED THE PLACE,
I DON'T THINK THEY FOUND IT.

30:23.990 --> 30:26.110
[MALACHY] PLUS, YOU SEEM TO
HAVE RUINED WHATEVER WAS GOING

30:26.150 --> 30:29.780
DOWN ON THAT BOAT. BOZO.
[JAKE] WHAT CAN I SAY? TROUBLE

30:29.820 --> 30:31.910
JUST HAS A WAY OF FINDING ME.

30:31.950 --> 30:33.700
[ROSE] I THINK IT'S THE OTHER
WAY AROUND ACTUALLY.

30:33.750 --> 30:35.250
[JAKE] WHATEVER. POINT IS,
THEY NEED TO MAKE ANOTHER

30:35.290 --> 30:37.500
EXCHANGE. WE JUST NEED TO FIND
A WAY TO GET IN ON IT.

30:37.540 --> 30:39.540
[MALACHY] BUT HOW?

30:42.460 --> 30:45.470
&lt;♪♪&gt;

30:54.350 --> 30:56.810
[JAKE] NOTHING SAYS DESPERATION
LIKE A REALLY HOT GIRL

30:56.850 --> 30:58.560
DRINKING ALONE AT A BAR.

30:58.600 --> 31:00.560
[LAURA] OH MY GOD.
ARE YOU HITTING ON ME NOW?

31:00.610 --> 31:02.070
[JAKE] I CAN IF YOU WANT ME TO.

31:02.110 --> 31:03.440
PLEASE DON'T TELL ME
YOU'RE GONNA MACE ME?

31:03.480 --> 31:04.860
[LAURA] CHECK, PLEASE!

31:07.150 --> 31:11.950
[JAKE] YOUR BROTHER IN-LAW,
YOUR BOYFRIEND IN JAIL,

31:11.990 --> 31:13.370
TWO COWBOYS.

31:15.660 --> 31:17.790
THAT'S SOME LOAD OF MEN TO HAVE
IN YOUR LIFE LAURA.

31:17.830 --> 31:18.920
[LAURA] DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT.

31:18.960 --> 31:20.330
[JAKE] REALLY?

31:20.370 --> 31:21.750
THESE ARE THE TWO GUYS
THAT BROKE INTO YOUR APARTMENT.

31:21.790 --> 31:23.500
THEY WERE LOOKING FOR
SOMETHING, THEY DIDN'T FIND IT

31:23.540 --> 31:25.800
CAUSE I INTERRUPTED THEM.
[LAURA] OKAY, YOU'RE OUTTA YOUR

31:25.840 --> 31:27.550
MIND.
[JAKE] I DON'T THINK SO.

31:27.590 --> 31:30.130
SEE I THINK THIS HAS SOMETHING
TO DO WITH DRUGS.

31:30.180 --> 31:32.510
WHATEVER IT WAS, YOU WERE
TRYING TO EXCHANGE IT WITH THEM

31:32.550 --> 31:34.810
ON THE BOAT THE OTHER NIGHT.

31:34.850 --> 31:36.310
[LAURA] HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

31:36.350 --> 31:39.350
ARE YOU SPYING ON ME?
[JAKE] DAY AND NIGHT.

31:41.690 --> 31:44.110
SEEING HOW THIS IS
OUR FIRST DATE AND ALL,

31:44.150 --> 31:46.360
YOU SHOULD LET ME GET THAT
YOU COULD GET THE MOVIE.

31:46.400 --> 31:47.820
[LAURA] I WOULDN'T LET YOU
BUY ME A DRINK

31:47.860 --> 31:49.860
IF YOU WERE THE LAST
DICK ON EARTH.

31:51.950 --> 31:53.950
LEAVE ME AND MY SISTER ALONE.

31:55.700 --> 31:57.660
[MAN] JAKE DOYLE?
[JAKE] YEAH?

31:57.700 --> 31:58.330
[MAN] PEACE BOND.

31:58.370 --> 31:59.000
FROM YOUR WIFE.

31:59.040 --> 31:59.910
YOU'VE BEEN SERVED.

31:59.960 --> 32:02.130
HAVE A NICE DAY.

32:02.170 --> 32:03.250
[JAKE] PEACE BOND?

32:03.290 --> 32:07.210
WHAT IS THAT, LIKE A
RESTRAINING ORDER?

32:07.260 --> 32:08.920
[JAKE] HURRY UP WE GOTTA
PLANT THIS BUG.

32:08.970 --> 32:10.550
[MALACHY] YOU SHOULD
TALK TO HER.

32:10.590 --> 32:12.510
[JAKE] I AM NOT ALLOWED
TO TALK TO HER.
IT'S THE WHOLE POINT.

32:12.550 --> 32:14.760
I MEAN I CAN SCREAM AT
HER FROM A HUNDRED YARDS

32:14.800 --> 32:17.310
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT.
THESE THINGS ARE PRETTY
CHEAP THESE DAYS.

32:17.350 --> 32:19.060
YOU COULD BUY
A COUPLE OF NEW ONES?

32:19.100 --> 32:21.060
[MALACHY] THESE WORK FINE.
[JAKE] THEY WORK FINE?

32:21.100 --> 32:23.730
JUST LIKE THE LAST ONE YOU
PLANTED, REMEMBER THAT?

32:23.770 --> 32:25.520
REMEMBER HOW IT DIDN'T WORK
EXCEPT FOR THE LAST 15 MINUTES

32:25.570 --> 32:27.110
OF POLKA-DOT DOOR WE PICKED UP.

32:27.150 --> 32:31.110
[MALACHY] THAT'S A GOOD SHOW.

32:31.150 --> 32:33.910
ROSE THINKS I SHOULD LET YOU
PLANT THESE FROM NOW ON.

32:33.950 --> 32:35.700
HERE.

32:35.740 --> 32:38.080
[JAKE] YOU KNOW, THAT ROSE,
I ALWAYS KNEW THAT SHE HAD
GREAT TASTE.

32:38.120 --> 32:40.120
EXCEPT FOR MEN.
SHE DOESN'T HAVE GREAT TASTE
IN MEN, MEANING YOU.

32:40.160 --> 32:44.330
[MALACHY] WATCH YOUR MOUTH
SON.

32:44.380 --> 32:45.960
THAT'S THE LOVE OF MY LIFE.

32:46.790 --> 32:49.800
&lt;♪♪&gt;

33:15.030 --> 33:16.070
[TRAVIS] GOT IT.

33:16.120 --> 33:18.120
[JAKE] HELLO LADIES.

33:22.620 --> 33:24.620
SADDLE UP.

33:31.170 --> 33:33.470
[JAKE] MORNING, SUNSHINE--
WELL IT'S NOT REALLY MORNING,

33:33.510 --> 33:34.840
MORE LIKE AFTERNOON.

33:34.880 --> 33:36.260
[TRAVIS] LET ME OUT OF HERE MAN.

33:36.300 --> 33:38.100
[JAKE] ARE YOU THE FELLOWS THAT
ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MY BUDDY

33:38.140 --> 33:41.770
BENNY ENDING UP IN JAIL?

33:41.810 --> 33:43.600
NUMBER THIRTY-FIVE.

33:43.640 --> 33:45.440
HEY, WHAT'S THAT FOR HEY?

33:45.480 --> 33:46.400
WHAT'S THAT ALL ABOUT?

33:46.440 --> 33:48.520
[TRAVIS] LET ME UP MAN.

33:48.560 --> 33:52.150
&lt;TURNS ON HAIR DRYER&gt;
[JAKE] WHAT IS THE KEY FOR,

33:52.190 --> 33:54.320
TRA-- ARE YOU-- NO, YOU MUST BE
TRAVIS, RIGHT?

33:54.360 --> 33:55.240
YOU'RE TRAVIS.

33:55.280 --> 33:56.280
WHAT'S THE KEY FOR BUDDY?

33:56.320 --> 33:56.950
YOU BETTER TELL ME.

33:56.990 --> 33:58.120
OR--
&lt;TURNS ON HAIR DRYER&gt;

33:58.160 --> 33:59.780
[TRAVIS] NO!

34:01.660 --> 34:03.160
NO!

34:03.200 --> 34:04.710
[JAKE] NOW I GUESS WHAT YOU'RE
WONDERING IS WILL I ACTUALLY

34:04.750 --> 34:07.080
DO IT? WELL LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING. BENNY IS ONE OF MY

34:07.120 --> 34:09.340
BEST FRIENDS, IN FACT HE IS
ALMOST FAMILY. AND IF YOU'RE

34:09.380 --> 34:12.260
RESPONSIBLE FOR HIM BEING IN
JAIL, YES SIR.

34:12.300 --> 34:13.420
YOU BETTER BELIEVE I'LL DO IT.

34:13.460 --> 34:15.260
[TRAVIS] MAN WHAT ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?!

34:15.300 --> 34:19.140
[JAKE] DRUG DEAL WITH BRIAN,
YOU WANTED TO CUT HIM OUT

34:19.180 --> 34:21.760
MAYBE? LET BENNY TAKE THE
FALL? SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

34:21.810 --> 34:23.930
[TRAVIS] ARE YOU NUTS! BRIAN
DYING IS LIKE THE WORST THIS

34:23.980 --> 34:26.230
THAT COULD HAVE POSSIBLY
HAPPENED. NOW I GOTTA DEAL WITH

34:26.270 --> 34:27.440
THIS LAURA COW.

34:27.480 --> 34:29.060
[JAKE] SURE ABOUT THAT?
&lt;TURNS ON HAIR DRYER&gt;

34:29.110 --> 34:31.270
[TRAVIS] IF I SEE YOU AGAIN,
YOU'RE A DEAD MAN!

34:31.320 --> 34:33.280
[JAKE] SEE, THAT'S THE KIND
OF STUFF YOU SAY TO A GUY

34:33.320 --> 34:37.240
WHEN YOU'RE NOT ABOUT TO BE
ELECTROCUTED IN A BATHTUB.

34:37.280 --> 34:38.740
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM WITH LAURA?

34:38.780 --> 34:41.740
[TRAVIS] WE HAD A DEAL FOR SOME
COKE, I GAVE BRIAN THE MONEY

34:41.780 --> 34:43.790
AND HE DIES BEFORE WE CAN
GET THE DRUGS. ALL I KNOW IS

34:43.830 --> 34:46.160
THE COKE IS SUPPOSED TO BE
IN A GYM LOCKER SOMEWHERE!

34:46.210 --> 34:47.330
[JAKE] YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?
[TRAVIS] YES!

34:47.370 --> 34:48.210
[JAKE] YOU TELLING ME
THE TRUTH?

34:48.250 --> 34:49.500
[TRAVIS] YES!

34:49.540 --> 34:51.340
[JAKE] YOU BETTER BE.

34:51.380 --> 34:55.260
I DON'T WANT YOUR MONEY PAL AND
I DON'T WANT YOUR DRUGS.

34:55.300 --> 34:59.510
BUT IF I FIND OUT YOU'RE THE
REASON BENNY IS IN JAIL...

34:59.550 --> 35:00.800
HAVE A NICE DAY.

35:00.840 --> 35:06.600
[TRAVIS] &lt;SCREAMS&gt;
[JAKE] NOW YOU AND YOUR BFF,

35:06.640 --> 35:10.270
CAN RIDE OFF INTO THE SUNSET
TOGETHER.

35:10.310 --> 35:13.320
&lt;♪♪&gt;

35:18.530 --> 35:19.820
&lt;SMASHING GLASS BOTTLE&gt;
[DR. NATCHE] HEY!

35:19.860 --> 35:21.320
YOU LOOKING FOR ME?

35:21.360 --> 35:23.700
BRIAN HARRIS GOT MY SON INTO
DRUGS. THAT'S WHY I DID IT.

35:23.740 --> 35:25.370
I KILLED HIM. ARREST ME.

35:25.410 --> 35:28.040
I KILLED BRAIN HARRIS.

35:31.630 --> 35:33.210
[MALACHY] DR. NATCHE IS
STICKING TO HIS CONFESSION,

35:33.250 --> 35:35.920
THEY'RE HOLDING HIM PENDING
FURTHER INVESTIGATION.

35:35.960 --> 35:37.460
[JAKE] THIS DOESN'T MAKE ANY
SENSE.

35:37.510 --> 35:39.380
[MALACHY] I KNOW, BUT WHEN IT
COMES TO FAMILY, IT DOESN'T

35:39.430 --> 35:42.300
HAVE TO MAKE SENSE. A FATHER
WILL DO ANYTHING FOR HIS KIDS.

35:42.350 --> 35:43.390
[JAKE] OH YEAH?

35:43.430 --> 35:45.350
WOULD YOU DIE FOR ME?
[MALACHY] NO.

35:45.390 --> 35:47.350
[JAKE] WOULD YOU TAKE
A BULLET FOR ME?
[MALACHY] NO.

35:47.390 --> 35:49.480
[JAKE] WOULD YOU GO TO
JAIL FOR ME THEN?
[MALACHY] GOD NO.

35:49.520 --> 35:53.520
IT'S A FULL TIME JOB TRYING
TO KEEP YOU OUT OF THERE.
[JAKE] &lt;LAUGHS&gt;

35:59.570 --> 36:01.740
[MALACHY] IT'S YOUR FATHER.
[JAKE] HE'S IN JAIL.

36:01.780 --> 36:04.200
[BENNY] WHAT? WHAT FOR?
[MALACHY] RIGHT NOW?

36:04.240 --> 36:06.910
CREATING A DISTURBANCE,
AND PUBLIC INTOXICATION.

36:06.950 --> 36:08.620
[JAKE] YEAH
BUT IF IT'S UP TO HIM,

36:08.660 --> 36:11.540
BY EVENING IT'LL BE IN FOR
MANSLAUGHTER CAUSE HE
CONFESSED TO BRIAN'S MURDER.

36:11.580 --> 36:12.920
[BENNY] HE WASN'T EVEN THERE.

36:12.960 --> 36:14.630
[JAKE] IT'S FUNNY HOW PEOPLE
WOULD DO THAT, ISN'T IT?

36:14.670 --> 36:16.750
TAKE THE RAP FOR SOMETHING
THEY DIDN'T DO LIKE THAT?

36:16.800 --> 36:18.420
[MALACHY] THE APPLE DOESN'T
FALL FAR DOES IT?

36:18.460 --> 36:20.050
[JAKE] DO YOUR REMEMBER WHEN
WE WERE KIDS BENNY? REMEMBER

36:20.090 --> 36:21.760
THAT? EVERY TIME WE GOT INTO
TROUBLE YOU ALWAYS TOOK THE

36:21.800 --> 36:23.340
RAP, DIDN'T YOU?
[BENNY] WHAT DID I TELL YOU?

36:23.390 --> 36:25.890
I SAID DON'T--
[JAKE] WE KNOW LAURA CAME TO

36:25.930 --> 36:27.810
VISIT YOU BENNY, WE KNOW THAT.

36:27.850 --> 36:29.520
SHE DID, DIDN'T SHE?

36:29.560 --> 36:31.890
YOU ROLLED OVER,
JUST LIKE ALWAYS.

36:31.940 --> 36:33.400
BUT IF SHE KILLED HIM BENNY...

36:33.440 --> 36:34.360
[BENNY] WE GOTTA GET DAD OUT.

36:34.400 --> 36:35.310
[MALACHY] WE CAN'T.

36:35.360 --> 36:38.030
ONLY YOU CAN DO THAT.

36:38.070 --> 36:40.240
[JAKE] BENNY, YOU GOTTA THINK
ABOUT YOUR FAMILY AND WHAT

36:40.280 --> 36:42.450
YOU'RE DOING TO THEM.
[BENNY] I AM THINKING ABOUT MY

36:42.490 --> 36:43.950
FAMILY.

36:43.990 --> 36:46.830
GUARD?

36:46.870 --> 36:48.410
GUARD I WANT TO MAKE A
STATEMENT.

36:48.450 --> 36:52.250
[JAKE] WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
[BENNY] I KILLED BRIAN HARRIS

36:52.290 --> 36:55.330
AND I WANT TO SIGN A
CONFESSION.

36:55.380 --> 36:56.750
[JAKE] BENNY.

37:00.840 --> 37:02.170
[JAKE] WHAT DO WE GOT?

37:02.220 --> 37:03.510
[MALACHY] WELL, WE GOT A
LOCKER FULL OF DRUGS,

37:03.550 --> 37:06.430
TWO COWBOYS, BENNY IN JAIL,
A LYING SISTER AND A PREGNANT

37:06.470 --> 37:10.850
WIDOW.
[MALACHY] A PREGNANT WIDOW.

37:10.890 --> 37:13.270
[JAKE] A PREGNANT WIDOW!
[JAKE] ALL RIGHT.

37:13.310 --> 37:15.100
SO WE ALREADY KNOW
THAT BENNY IS LYING TO US.

37:15.150 --> 37:16.310
WE KNOW THAT FOR SURE RIGHT?
[MALACHY] YEAH.

37:16.360 --> 37:18.070
[JAKE] AND IF A FATHER,
WELL MOST FATHERS WILL DO

37:18.110 --> 37:21.570
ANYTHING FOR HIS KIDS.
[MALACHY] BENNY'S THE FATHER.

37:21.610 --> 37:24.490
[JAKE] MAYBE BENNY IS THE
FATHER. JUST GIVE ME YOU'RE

37:24.530 --> 37:27.120
CAMERA FIND THE PICTURE FROM
THE SIGN IN BOOK WITH LAURA'S

37:27.160 --> 37:32.410
SIGNATURE IN IT.
I GOT THIS IN HERE.

37:32.460 --> 37:33.790
[MALACHY] HERE YOU GO.
[JAKE] OKAY LOOK THIS IS

37:33.830 --> 37:36.130
LAURA'S REAL SIGNATURE,
ALL RIGHT?

37:36.170 --> 37:39.630
THIS IS HER SIGNATURE FROM THE
SIGN IN BOOK.

37:39.670 --> 37:42.840
[MALACHY] THEY DON'T MATCH.
[JAKE] THEY DON'T MATCH.

37:42.880 --> 37:44.340
[REG] OH, GREAT.
YOU TWO AGAIN.

37:44.380 --> 37:46.470
[JAKE] REG, BUDDY.
GREAT TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

37:46.510 --> 37:51.470
LISTEN, I JUST NEED YOU
TO ANSWER ONE QUESTION.

37:51.520 --> 37:55.940
WHICH ONE OF THESE GIRLS WAS
VISITING BENNY IN PRISON?

37:55.980 --> 37:59.770
LOOK CLOSELY NOW.

37:59.820 --> 38:01.730
[REG] THAT'S HER.
[JAKE] YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

38:01.780 --> 38:03.900
[REG] HER HAIR'S BROWN NOW
THOUGH.

38:03.940 --> 38:08.320
[JAKE] HER HAIR IS BROWN NOW.
BROWN LIKE A WIG MAYBE?

38:12.700 --> 38:14.000
[JAKE] OH HO!

38:14.040 --> 38:15.540
[LAURA] WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

38:15.580 --> 38:17.000
[JAKE] GOING ON A TRIP ARE WE?

38:17.040 --> 38:18.960
WHILE MY CHILDHOOD FRIEND
CONFESSES TO A MURDER HE

38:19.000 --> 38:20.800
DIDN'T COMMIT, NICE.
[MALACHY] YOU MIGHT NOT WANT

38:20.840 --> 38:22.380
TO CARRY HEAVY ITEMS IN YOUR
CONDITION.

38:22.420 --> 38:24.590
[LAURA] THERESA, DON'T.
[JAKE] WHERE'S THE WIG?

38:24.630 --> 38:26.470
YOU LIKE DRESSING UP LIKE YOUR
SISTER WHEN YOU GO VISIT THE

38:26.510 --> 38:29.720
FATHER OF YOUR UNBORN BABY IN
PRISON? BENJAMIN IS A GOOD

38:29.760 --> 38:31.140
NAME FOR A BOY.

38:31.180 --> 38:32.720
OR IS IT A GIRL?

38:32.770 --> 38:34.810
EITHER WAY, IT'S GONNA BE NICE
TO HAVE A DOCTOR IN THE FAMILY.

38:34.850 --> 38:36.270
[THERESA] I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT?

38:36.310 --> 38:38.440
[MALACHY] BRIAN FOUND OUT YOU
WERE CARRYING BENNY'S CHILD.

38:38.480 --> 38:41.070
[JAKE] I GUESS HE WASN'T TOO
HAPPY ABOUT IT?

38:41.110 --> 38:42.480
[THERESA] HOW DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT--

38:42.530 --> 38:43.530
[LAURA] THERESA, SHUT UP.

38:43.570 --> 38:44.740
YOU TWO GET OUT RIGHT NOW.

38:44.780 --> 38:46.530
[JAKE] YOUR HUSBAND WAS
BEATING THE CRAP OUT OF BENNY,

38:46.570 --> 38:48.240
YOU SHOWED UP, YOU GRABBED
SOMETHING YOU STOPPED HIM

38:48.280 --> 38:49.910
DIDN'T YOU?
[MALACHY] THERESA, IF BRIAN

38:49.950 --> 38:52.280
WAS GOING TO KILL BENNY, THERE
ARE WAYS AROUND THIS.

38:52.330 --> 38:53.370
THE LAW IS THE LAW.

38:53.410 --> 38:54.660
IF YOU WERE PROTECTING HIM.

38:54.700 --> 38:56.370
[LAURA] DON'T LISTEN TO HIM.
[MALACHY] WE KNOW YOU NEVER

38:56.410 --> 38:57.620
MEANT TO KILL BRIAN, THERESA.

38:57.670 --> 38:59.330
[LAURA] THERE'S NO PROOF FOR
ANY OF THIS.

38:59.380 --> 39:02.000
[JAKE] WE'RE NOT LISTENING TO
YOU, CAUSE YOU TELLS LIES.

39:02.040 --> 39:05.670
[THERESA] I DIDN'T MEAN FOR
BENNY TO TAKE THE BLAME
FOR ANY OF THIS, YOU KNOW?

39:05.710 --> 39:08.720
[MALACHY] ALL THE DRUG MONEY
IN THE WORLD CAN NEVER GET
YOU FAR ENOUGH AWAY FROM THIS.

39:11.510 --> 39:14.060
[JAKE] THERESA, YOU NEED
TO GET A LAWYER,

39:14.100 --> 39:17.100
AND YOU HAVE TO COME CLEAN
WITH WHAT YOU DID.

39:19.230 --> 39:22.480
YOU HAVE TO DO
THE RIGHT THING HERE.

39:22.520 --> 39:25.530
&lt;♪♪&gt;

39:32.780 --> 39:34.490
[BENNY] WHAT'S GOING ON?

39:34.540 --> 39:36.500
[DR. NATCHE] IT'S GOING
TO BE OKAY, BENNY.
WE HAVE A GOOD LAWYER.

39:36.540 --> 39:40.920
THERESA IS GOING TO BE FINE.
YOUR CHILD WILL BE FINE.

39:40.960 --> 39:42.960
WE WILL DO THIS TOGETHER.

39:47.630 --> 39:50.130
[JAKE] I WAS TALKING TO WALTER,
THEY'RE GONNA BE LAYING CHARGES.

39:50.180 --> 39:51.390
BUT IT COULD GO EITHER WAY.

39:51.430 --> 39:53.600
[MALACHY] LAWFUL DEFENSE
OF A THIRD PARTY.

39:53.640 --> 39:56.770
[ROSE] SO THERE'S A CHANCE
THAT THERESA WON'T HAVE TO
HAVE HER BABY BEHIND BARS.

39:56.810 --> 39:58.560
[JAKE] IT'S STILL A HELL OF
A WAY TO START A FAMILY.

39:58.600 --> 40:00.350
[MALACHY] IF BENNY HAD JUST
APPROACHED THIS CALMLY FROM

40:00.390 --> 40:02.150
THE START, THEY MIGHT NEVER
HAVE HAPPENED.

40:02.190 --> 40:04.820
[JAKE] YEAH. TRUE.
[MALACHY] THERE'S A LESSON FOR

40:04.860 --> 40:07.610
YOU IN THIS, TOO.
[JAKE] IS THERE REALLY?

40:07.650 --> 40:10.240
[MALACHY] CALM.
[JAKE] CALM?

40:10.280 --> 40:12.160
[MALACHY] YEAH.
[JAKE] THAT'S THE LESSON?

40:12.200 --> 40:15.450
LISTEN, YOU WOULDN'T DIE FOR
ME, WOULD YOU?

40:15.490 --> 40:16.660
[MALACHY] NOPE.

40:16.700 --> 40:18.410
I'VE ANOTHER SON AS WELL AS A
DAUGHTER WHICH MAKES YOU

40:18.450 --> 40:19.660
EXPENDABLE.

40:19.710 --> 40:20.920
YOU'RE THE THIRD BORN.

40:20.960 --> 40:22.500
THE RUNT OF THE LITTER.

40:22.540 --> 40:24.540
[JAKE] THE FATHERLY LOVE FROM
YOU IS JUST LIKE ONE OF THOSE

40:24.590 --> 40:25.790
LATTER DAY SAINTS COMMERCIAL.

40:25.840 --> 40:28.170
SO MUCH COMPASSION.
[MALACHY] MOVE OUT OF MY HOUSE!

40:28.210 --> 40:30.510
[JAKE] I'LL MOVE OUT WHEN I'M
GOOD AND READY.

40:30.550 --> 40:31.630
[ROSE] LETS GO BUDDY.

40:31.680 --> 40:33.430
BED TIME.

40:37.640 --> 40:40.640
&lt;♪♪&gt;

40:47.690 --> 40:49.650
[TRAVIS] BINGO.

40:49.690 --> 40:52.450
&lt;♪♪&gt;

41:00.290 --> 41:02.750
[JAKE] YES BUDDY.
LIKE YOU WOULD.

41:02.790 --> 41:07.750
&lt;CELL PHONE RINGS&gt;
[JAKE] &lt;FROM PHONE&gt; DOYLE.

41:07.800 --> 41:09.170
[LESLIE] I GOT YOUR LITTLE TIP.

41:09.210 --> 41:11.300
THE DRUGS WERE IN THE LOCKER,
JUST LIKE YOU SAID.

41:11.340 --> 41:13.630
[JAKE] CONSTABLE, IT WAS MY
PLEASURE, YOU KNOW I WAS JUST

41:13.680 --> 41:16.720
TRYING TO ATONE FOR THE WHOLE
BOAT DEBACLE. IF YOU WANT

41:16.760 --> 41:19.680
SOMETIME I CAN REALLY TRULY
MAKE IT UP TO YOU?

41:19.720 --> 41:22.230
[LESLIE] WE'RE EVEN, I THINK.

41:22.270 --> 41:24.310
[JAKE] IF YOU CHANGE YOUR
MIND, I'LL BE HERE ALL NIGHT.

41:24.350 --> 41:26.520
YOU'RE A COP, I'M PRETTY SURE
YOU CAN FIGURE OUT MY ADDRESS

41:26.560 --> 41:28.650
CAN'T YOU?

41:28.690 --> 41:32.700
[LESLIE] YOU NEVER KNOW.
NIGHT, MR. DOYLE.

41:32.740 --> 41:34.490
[JAKE] NIGHT, CONSTABLE.

41:43.870 --> 41:49.500
&lt;KNOCKING AT THE DOOR&gt;
[JAKE] NO WAY. SHE'S HERE.

41:54.510 --> 41:57.090
[JAKE] WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

41:57.140 --> 42:00.140
&lt;♪♪&gt;

43:06.830 --> 43:09.580
&lt;♪♪&gt;
