00:05.678 --> 00:10.934
These two title MTV cartoon guys
thought the band KISS was pretty cool...

00:11.018 --> 00:13.269
Who is Beavis and Butt-Head?

00:13.352 --> 00:15.022
-Ben?
-Who are Beavis and Butt-Head?

00:15.105 --> 00:16.898
-Yup!
- TV character for 400.

00:17.898 --> 00:20.651
I'm not good
at meeting people for the first time.

00:20.736 --> 00:24.280
-Hey. Nice to meet you. Nathan.
-Pleased to meet you. How are you? Kor.

00:27.074 --> 00:28.868
- Door city over here.
- Yes.

00:28.952 --> 00:33.080
So, this is basically, it's like a portal,
I guess, on some levels.

00:34.207 --> 00:35.250
Yeah.

00:35.334 --> 00:38.462
I have been told my personality
can make people uncomfortable,

00:38.544 --> 00:40.379
so I have to work to offset that.

00:41.380 --> 00:45.176
Humor is my go-to instinct,
but every joke is a gamble.

00:45.761 --> 00:48.555
- Shoes off or...
- Please walk as is.

00:48.638 --> 00:51.308
- And--
- Okay. Shirt off? Or? Just kidding.

00:51.390 --> 00:52.726
- I'll leave my shirt on.
- It's not that...

00:53.101 --> 00:55.936
- No, it's not that kind of place.
- No, it's not, I'm just kidding.

00:56.020 --> 00:59.024
So far it was going well, and it had to,

00:59.398 --> 01:03.319
because I was about to ask this man
to trust me with his life.

01:04.278 --> 01:07.574
Kor Skeet is a 50-year-old teacher
from Brooklyn, New York,

01:08.033 --> 01:10.660
and there is nothing
he loves more than trivia.

01:10.743 --> 01:12.953
I'm very good at television trivia.

01:13.329 --> 01:15.749
Who is the youngest person
to ever be inducted

01:15.832 --> 01:18.085
into the Television Hall of Fame?

01:18.542 --> 01:19.585
It's a female.

01:19.669 --> 01:21.087
- Who?
- Oprah Winfrey.

01:22.046 --> 01:23.089
A few months ago,

01:23.172 --> 01:27.094
Kor responded to a vague Craigslist post
I put on the internet,

01:27.177 --> 01:32.015
sharing a story about a lie he told his
bar trivia team over 12 years ago.

01:32.599 --> 01:36.268
I told my friends
that I had an advanced degree,

01:36.352 --> 01:39.898
and I didn't.
I play trivia with them often,

01:39.982 --> 01:41.817
and the problem was that I...

01:41.900 --> 01:43.860
wanted to seem like I was smarter
than I was.

01:44.193 --> 01:46.655
My teammates
all had advanced degrees.

01:47.197 --> 01:49.615
I decided to let them think
I had a master's degree

01:50.074 --> 01:52.494
when I was just getting my bachelor's.

01:53.537 --> 01:57.457
- You've quite a collection.
- Yeah, I'm a bibliophile.

01:58.083 --> 02:01.293
How to Make Love All Night
and Drive a Woman Wild?

02:02.211 --> 02:03.379
Well, you know?

02:03.462 --> 02:06.007
I think we're gonna get along
pretty well.

02:06.466 --> 02:08.552
- I don't know about that. I...
- Yeah.

02:09.177 --> 02:13.014
And now it's gotten to the point
where he's lying to them every day.

02:13.097 --> 02:15.474
I have a friend on the team
that keeps sending me,

02:16.392 --> 02:18.812
jobs that require a master's degree.

02:19.228 --> 02:21.356
So now, it's being shoved back
in my face again,

02:21.439 --> 02:23.442
and I'm running out of excuses.

02:24.026 --> 02:27.695
I understand his dilemma.
This trivia team is his life.

02:28.446 --> 02:32.450
And when you reveal your true self,
people don't always like what they see.

02:33.326 --> 02:36.538
But I wanted to show him
that if you plan for every variable,

02:36.620 --> 02:39.874
a happy outcome
doesn't have to be left to chance.

02:43.253 --> 02:46.047
I assume you've seen
some of my previous work? Or...

02:46.130 --> 02:47.965
- I'm afraid I haven't.
- Okay.

02:49.635 --> 02:51.595
It's... I made a show called
Nathan For You.

02:52.054 --> 02:53.012
Okay.

02:54.180 --> 02:57.350
Didn't you say your trivia specialty
is television shows?

02:57.434 --> 02:59.393
It is, but there's even a limitation
on that.

02:59.811 --> 03:02.813
- Okay.
- Yeah.

03:03.773 --> 03:06.652
- I mean, you should check it out.
- I mean, definitely.

03:06.734 --> 03:10.112
But a lot of it involved
working with real people...

03:10.197 --> 03:11.781
...so I'd have to put myself in all these

03:12.239 --> 03:16.369
uncertain environments
and I became really good at

03:16.912 --> 03:19.873
predicting how people
would act in a future situation.

03:20.374 --> 03:22.709
- Okay, okay.
- For example.

03:23.293 --> 03:26.671
Like this conversation's going
pretty well, right?

03:26.755 --> 03:29.632
- Okay, I'd like to continue it.
- I mean, do you think so? I don't know.

03:29.716 --> 03:32.051
- Yeah. I'm... So far, so good.
- I mean, we've been having fun.

03:32.135 --> 03:34.930
I assume we have been
sharing some laughs so far.

03:35.012 --> 03:37.139
Yeah. I hope to continue that way.

03:37.599 --> 03:39.142
So, that's no accident.

03:41.435 --> 03:46.275
Everything that's happened so far today,
I have rehearsed it dozens of times.

03:47.609 --> 03:52.823
These exact words, in a replica of
your home, with an actor playing you.

03:53.991 --> 03:55.033
Okay.

03:55.116 --> 03:58.203
Remember a couple of weeks ago,
when the gas company came by

03:58.285 --> 03:59.705
because of a leak in your building?

04:00.706 --> 04:02.916
Yes...

04:02.999 --> 04:06.503
Well, there wasn't a leak
in your building, that was my team.

04:06.585 --> 04:08.087
Gotta check the stove...

04:08.463 --> 04:09.965
Ehen you gave them access,

04:10.047 --> 04:13.218
they secretly made
a digital map of your entire home.

04:14.343 --> 04:16.304
We then recreated
every detail of this space

04:16.388 --> 04:19.849
as a physical set in a warehouse
a few miles from here.

04:20.433 --> 04:22.059
And with the help of a fake you,

04:22.144 --> 04:25.480
I could practice every single permutation
of this interaction

04:25.813 --> 04:27.149
and have a plan for it.

04:27.232 --> 04:29.776
I mean, do you think
I should say something about the doors?

04:30.277 --> 04:33.696
The actor I hired
analyzed your submission video

04:33.779 --> 04:36.449
to mimic your speech patterns
and psychology.

04:36.533 --> 04:38.784
Well, it's me with my...
my parents, I was...

04:38.868 --> 04:41.662
I can't remember,
maybe I was about ten?

04:42.164 --> 04:44.833
How to Make Love All Night
and Drive a Woman Wild?

04:45.208 --> 04:46.417
Yeah, that was a...

04:46.501 --> 04:49.004
I feel like we're going to
get along pretty well.

04:49.086 --> 04:50.921
And we tried over and over.

04:51.256 --> 04:52.423
-Hi. Nathan.
-Hey.

04:52.507 --> 04:54.091
-Hi. Nathan.
-Hi. Hey, hi.

04:54.175 --> 04:56.177
-Hi. Nathan.
-Hi. Hi.

04:57.303 --> 04:58.639
Door city over here.

04:58.972 --> 05:01.975
And I'd adjust each time
until I perfected it.

05:02.433 --> 05:05.270
- Or shoes off?
- No, you can leave them on, it's fine.

05:05.354 --> 05:07.439
All right. What about shirt off?

05:08.023 --> 05:09.066
Leave it on, please.

05:09.148 --> 05:10.858
Yeah, so that will probably
make him laugh.

05:10.943 --> 05:13.194
So everything that's happened
so far today,

05:13.653 --> 05:16.114
I have rehearsed it dozens of times.

05:16.197 --> 05:20.911
These exact words, in a replica of your
home, with an actor playing you.

05:21.954 --> 05:22.912
Wow!

05:25.415 --> 05:26.624
Wow!

05:26.708 --> 05:30.586
This is what we can do
for your lie with your friends.

05:30.670 --> 05:34.341
Your trivia, like, this is the potential
is what I am saying.

05:34.424 --> 05:35.717
I see. Like a person,

05:35.800 --> 05:40.054
if I had the ability to know...
if I knew what... how the other person

05:40.138 --> 05:42.224
or other people are going to react,
or how the situation is going to go...

05:42.641 --> 05:43.975
- You'll know.
- Yeah.

05:44.059 --> 05:46.185
You'll know what exactly
to say for every possible way.

05:46.270 --> 05:48.355
Then that would be
extremely appealing, yes.

05:48.939 --> 05:51.608
But as we kept talking,
I began to understand

05:51.692 --> 05:54.568
the real reason he had been
putting this off for so long.

05:56.113 --> 05:57.990
Well, it's good except for one thing.

05:58.073 --> 06:00.658
Suppose one of my friends
might give a reaction

06:00.993 --> 06:03.161
that's very, very violent on some people,

06:03.537 --> 06:06.540
even beyond the several predictions
you can make.

06:07.582 --> 06:08.916
What do you mean by violent?

06:09.459 --> 06:14.089
Like, you know, call me names and
saying things that are so unforgivable

06:14.172 --> 06:16.799
that I couldn't be their friend
after that.

06:18.218 --> 06:20.636
Who are you worried about specifically?

06:25.058 --> 06:28.520
I'd rather not reveal the name,
not at this point, but...

06:29.688 --> 06:32.482
it's definitely someone
that's on the team.

06:33.066 --> 06:35.443
I found myself in an odd situation.

06:36.194 --> 06:38.947
Kor was willing to point out his friend
in a photo,

06:39.030 --> 06:41.658
but he wouldn't tell me
anything else about her.

06:41.742 --> 06:43.285
She looks so nice, what is it about her?

06:43.368 --> 06:45.745
She's a nice person, very nice, but...

06:46.622 --> 06:47.830
How do I put it?

06:49.332 --> 06:53.462
If she... depending on her mood,
you don't want to cross her too much.

06:54.462 --> 06:55.713
Oh, my God! Okay.

06:55.797 --> 06:58.507
It was frustrating.
My rehearsal for today

06:58.591 --> 07:00.761
was designed to get him to open up
about this stuff,

07:01.345 --> 07:03.846
but perhaps I had done something
to put him off.

07:05.097 --> 07:08.769
Thinking back, there was a somewhat
off-color joke I tried

07:08.852 --> 07:10.895
after a trip to the bathroom.

07:10.979 --> 07:14.482
Oh, my gosh, I should start
traveling with a plunger.

07:16.692 --> 07:19.279
- You think he'd find that funny? Or...
- Yeah.

07:19.362 --> 07:21.740
But when I did it with the real Kor,
it didn't land.

07:22.199 --> 07:25.117
Oh my God, I should start
traveling with a plunger.

07:26.160 --> 07:27.996
Well, well, well.

07:31.083 --> 07:32.501
I should invest in them.

07:33.335 --> 07:35.544
- Are they expensive?
- No. No.

07:37.171 --> 07:38.423
Could that joke have been it?

07:39.966 --> 07:42.635
I'd intended the joke
to be self-deprecating

07:42.719 --> 07:44.845
about my unpredictable
bowel movements,

07:45.429 --> 07:46.931
but reflecting on it later,

07:47.014 --> 07:49.851
I realized he could have
interpreted it as a criticism

07:49.934 --> 07:52.562
that his bathroom was under-equipped.

07:53.480 --> 07:54.606
Whatever the reason,

07:54.689 --> 07:58.944
I couldn't stage a rehearsal for Kor
with no details about his friend.

07:59.278 --> 08:01.737
So, I planned a day trip for us upstate,

08:01.822 --> 08:04.700
that was strategically designed
to endear me to him

08:04.782 --> 08:06.660
and hopefully, get him to open up.

08:07.076 --> 08:08.620
- Have you ever been?
- Never.

08:08.703 --> 08:10.289
- You've never?
- Never in my entire life.

08:10.372 --> 08:13.166
So, your last name is Skeet
and you've never been skeet shooting?

08:13.249 --> 08:14.459
No, no.

08:18.964 --> 08:20.047
Pull.

08:24.218 --> 08:25.261
Pull.

08:28.140 --> 08:29.307
I didn't tell Kor,

08:29.391 --> 08:32.810
but I had arranged ahead of time
to have the guns loaded with blanks,

08:33.186 --> 08:35.772
in the hopes that it would create
a moment of bonding,

08:35.856 --> 08:38.191
because we were both bad at this.

08:42.903 --> 08:45.282
- You fired too early, man.
- I fired too early.

08:45.365 --> 08:47.033
Wow, we are not good at this.

08:48.493 --> 08:51.288
- But it's nice to have a new experience.
- Yeah.

08:51.872 --> 08:55.041
But this was just laying the groundwork
for the main event.

08:55.125 --> 08:59.171
The mutual disclosure of personal
information in a heated pool.

09:00.254 --> 09:05.010
- You mentioned you were married.
- Yes, I was married for five years.

09:11.223 --> 09:14.477
- I was married for three years.
- Didn't know that.

09:16.521 --> 09:17.730
Is it sad for you?

09:20.692 --> 09:22.778
I consider it one of my...

09:23.986 --> 09:26.031
one of the bigger failures of my life.

09:26.572 --> 09:28.992
- One of the what?
- Biggest failures of my life.

09:41.254 --> 09:43.632
I didn't want to go
too deep into my private life,

09:44.007 --> 09:47.261
so I'd pre-planned for an
elderly swimmer to interrupt us,

09:47.343 --> 09:49.096
in the hopes that it would convince Kor

09:49.179 --> 09:53.100
I was ready to share more
had the moment not been ruined.

09:54.350 --> 09:57.853
I wasn't sure if my portrayal
of vulnerability was convincing,

09:57.938 --> 10:02.609
but on the ride home, Kor finally told me
the name of his trivia friend, Tricia,

10:02.692 --> 10:04.319
and what she did for a living.

10:04.402 --> 10:10.241
She's been mostly a freelance
writer and she has a blog,

10:10.617 --> 10:14.621
gives information about things you
could do to save money and have fun.

10:16.081 --> 10:19.084
- What's the blog called?
- Cheap Chick in the City.

10:19.875 --> 10:22.628
- Cheap Chick in the City?
- Cheap Chick in the City.

10:26.258 --> 10:29.927
- Cheap Check in the City.
- Cheap Chick in the City.

10:32.805 --> 10:37.185
- Cheap Check in the City.
- Cheap Chick in the City.

10:38.895 --> 10:42.315
Cheap Chick in the City
seemed to be a bare-bones website

10:42.399 --> 10:45.485
dedicated to low-cost activities
in New York.

10:45.860 --> 10:48.780
I was hoping it would be a window
into Tricia's psyche,

10:48.863 --> 10:51.908
but it seemed like the majority
of posts were just apologies

10:51.991 --> 10:55.077
for not having
anything to post that day.

10:55.454 --> 10:58.957
I understand that. Sometimes
you don't want to say anything,

10:59.041 --> 11:01.625
but you do want people
to know you exist.

11:04.378 --> 11:07.132
Regardless, I was hopeful
this blog would be enough

11:07.214 --> 11:10.760
for the rehearsal actress
we'd hire to base her performance on,

11:10.843 --> 11:12.888
in addition to Kor's insights.

11:13.430 --> 11:19.977
She has an appeal for an actor named
Vincent... Karth... Karthreiser.

11:20.645 --> 11:22.855
But unfortunately, it wasn't enough.

11:23.230 --> 11:27.943
I think it's really useful to get a sense
of what their reactions might be,

11:28.028 --> 11:30.404
and the kinds
of words that they might use.

11:30.864 --> 11:32.490
So, to get her better access,

11:32.574 --> 11:35.785
I decided to create a blog
of my own called Thrifty Boy,

11:35.868 --> 11:39.830
and offered Tricia the opportunity
to write an article for us.

11:39.914 --> 11:41.874
And luckily, she took the gig.

11:43.669 --> 11:47.798
Her article would entail interviewing a
professional bird watcher for our site,

11:48.130 --> 11:50.842
because bird watching
is a thrifty thing to do.

11:52.219 --> 11:53.511
But what Tricia didn't know

11:53.594 --> 11:56.347
is that she'd be interviewing
her own doppelgänger,

11:56.431 --> 11:58.808
who would be studying her every move.

12:06.399 --> 12:09.319
-Nice to meet you.
-You look all dressed up for birdwatching.

12:09.695 --> 12:11.487
Tricia? That's my daughter's name.

12:11.571 --> 12:13.782
Funny. There's not very many
other Tricias or Patricia's ever.

12:14.198 --> 12:16.618
So, do you have any favorite birds?

12:16.701 --> 12:18.203
I do love hummingbirds.

12:18.704 --> 12:22.124
At first glance, this woman
didn't seem frightening at all,

12:22.207 --> 12:24.000
but she did like to talk.

12:24.084 --> 12:25.460
But you know my dad is really into birds.

12:25.543 --> 12:26.711
- Oh, yeah?
- He seriously has like--

12:26.795 --> 12:28.045
He lives in North Carolina, which I guess,

12:28.129 --> 12:29.714
apparently,
there's a very big bird show there.

12:29.798 --> 12:33.259
A really good book called The Huntress,
and I do recommend it. It's World War II.

12:33.342 --> 12:35.262
But otherwise, I mean,
aside from my roommates,

12:35.344 --> 12:38.723
I'm pretty happy with the way things are,
but my roommate's definitely...

12:38.807 --> 12:40.391
You know, like, "Hey, I'm running late,"

12:40.475 --> 12:42.893
like, but maybe he found a payphone,
maybe, but like...

12:42.978 --> 12:46.231
One time, like, the plane started
plunging, so after that, like...

12:46.315 --> 12:48.232
I still get kind of nervous
when I'm in a plane and...

12:48.317 --> 12:50.735
Over the course
of the 30-minute encounter,

12:50.818 --> 12:53.530
our actress had trouble
getting a single word in,

12:53.614 --> 12:56.324
even though she was the one
being interviewed.

12:56.408 --> 12:58.242
So, I have all the apps,
you know, for the different,

12:58.327 --> 13:02.372
airlines, on my phone, ready to go,
whenever I need to fly.

13:02.455 --> 13:05.125
American Airlines, Delta,
Gogo inflight entertainment.

13:05.208 --> 13:06.500
But before it was over,

13:06.584 --> 13:10.629
I wanted to get a sense of how Tricia
would respond to being lied to.

13:10.714 --> 13:13.132
Data that would be crucial
for our rehearsal.

13:13.507 --> 13:16.093
There's actually something I need
to come clean about.

13:16.178 --> 13:17.220
Okay.

13:17.303 --> 13:21.974
I said early on that my daughter's name
is Tricia but that was actually a lie.

13:22.059 --> 13:23.977
- Okay.
- I don't have a daughter.

13:24.060 --> 13:25.394
Okay.

13:26.312 --> 13:27.980
I guess I should have guessed
when you said you were 39,

13:28.065 --> 13:29.940
because it's a little young
to have a daughter these days.

13:30.358 --> 13:33.486
That's okay, that's funny,
because I was like, I mean, like I said,

13:33.569 --> 13:36.490
you don't meet too many other Tricias,
so I was a little surprised, but you know,

13:36.572 --> 13:39.242
that's... yeah, that's interesting,
but I understand.

13:39.325 --> 13:41.952
- I'm sorry that I...
- It's fine, don't worry.

13:42.036 --> 13:43.956
Do you have any funny moments
that you had with a bird?

13:44.038 --> 13:46.541
With birds?
Or any fun stories about birds?

13:47.209 --> 13:50.087
I was surprised
by how not mad Tricia was.

13:51.380 --> 13:53.173
Was Kor worried for nothing,

13:53.255 --> 13:57.176
or was Tricia just able to bottle up
her rage because it was a stranger?

13:58.428 --> 14:01.431
Kor was so convinced
she would have an extreme reaction

14:01.515 --> 14:05.435
that he insisted the confession
could only go down one-on-one,

14:05.518 --> 14:06.936
in a public place.

14:07.020 --> 14:10.565
Trivia would be, I think, the only place
that would not arouse suspicion,

14:10.649 --> 14:13.819
because that's something
we do out of habit already.

14:13.902 --> 14:18.115
I can probably get her in a trivia event,
by ourselves, just between she and I.

14:18.907 --> 14:21.743
But when I saw
the trivia bar Kor frequents,

14:21.826 --> 14:24.997
I was overwhelmed
by the chaos of the environment.

14:25.579 --> 14:28.874
This is footage I collected
from the Alligator Lounge in Brooklyn,

14:29.209 --> 14:31.503
and it seemed like
any aspect of this space

14:31.961 --> 14:35.089
could radically transform
the tone of his big moment.

14:36.341 --> 14:38.759
I had learned this firsthand
when I met Kor.

14:39.469 --> 14:40.887
I thought I would look cool,

14:41.387 --> 14:45.433
but due to just a slight difference
in chairs, I looked like a fool.

14:47.269 --> 14:51.106
It's hard to say what about this place
could affect Kor's confession,

14:51.732 --> 14:54.525
but I did notice
there were a lot of chairs,

14:54.942 --> 14:58.113
and I didn't want to leave
anything to chance.

14:59.071 --> 15:01.157
Kor had messaged Tricia
to play trivia with him

15:01.491 --> 15:05.412
in just under two weeks' time.
This is where it would happen.

15:06.204 --> 15:08.957
The place where he would
finally come clean.

15:10.250 --> 15:11.793
So with the clock now ticking,

15:11.876 --> 15:16.005
I invited Kor into my secret warehouse
to begin his rehearsal.

15:21.218 --> 15:25.014
Wow, this is... the perfect replica.

15:26.182 --> 15:31.437
That's not even a funhouse version of it.
It has... It looks... Wow!

15:35.691 --> 15:39.404
Every detail was meticulously
replicated this time.

15:39.487 --> 15:40.739
Oh, my gosh!

15:42.407 --> 15:43.450
Oh, my gosh!

15:43.824 --> 15:48.496
This spice rack, it's the exact spices
they have, the garlic, the basil.

15:48.580 --> 15:51.917
This chair is an exact...
This... These rips...

15:51.999 --> 15:56.712
Yeah, and that, even that's exactly
the way it is. The portrait kind of tilts.

15:57.213 --> 16:01.176
You see that balloon there?
That's in the real bar.

16:01.258 --> 16:05.138
It'll be like walking in,
in a normal level,

16:05.222 --> 16:08.140
and then being able
to know my bearings.

16:08.642 --> 16:11.811
When you show up on the actual night,
it'll feel just like this.

16:12.271 --> 16:13.981
- Yes.
- No surprises.

16:14.397 --> 16:15.439
No.

16:15.524 --> 16:18.110
You know everything
that's gonna happen.

16:20.737 --> 16:23.155
There's something strange
about entering a space

16:23.240 --> 16:25.325
that's indistinguishable from another.

16:26.368 --> 16:29.161
In moments,
you can forget where you are.

16:29.997 --> 16:33.708
To me, it's like... It's a little
surreal at times because...

16:33.792 --> 16:36.420
I mean it's like... You're the...

16:37.045 --> 16:39.381
you're Willy Wonka
in the Chocolate Factory

16:39.463 --> 16:42.926
and I'm Charlie Bucket,
trying to get the...

16:43.509 --> 16:46.138
I don't remember the plot fully,
what did Willy Wonka do?

16:46.220 --> 16:47.598
- Was he good?
- Well, he created--

16:47.680 --> 16:50.808
- Wasn't he a bad guy?
- He had some questionable things.

16:50.891 --> 16:56.647
He was this mysterious...
factory full of candy, basically.

16:56.732 --> 16:57.774
But I'm Willy...

16:57.857 --> 16:59.985
-I'm the bad guy in the story?
-Well, but he's a dream maker.

17:00.360 --> 17:03.404
And you're doing... you're making some
dreams happen for me.

17:03.488 --> 17:04.823
But kids died in the factory.

17:04.906 --> 17:09.535
Well, they supposedly died,
I don't know for sure if they actually--

17:09.620 --> 17:11.620
But they didn't get
some good fate out of it.

17:12.247 --> 17:15.916
I'll read the book again just to...
to look into it.

17:16.001 --> 17:17.044
Yeah.

17:27.471 --> 17:28.471
It's good.

17:29.681 --> 17:31.934
We started with basic blocking,

17:32.017 --> 17:35.227
and the first choice Kor
would have to make is where to sit.

17:35.812 --> 17:37.272
- What's yours? This one?
- Yep. Yes.

17:39.273 --> 17:40.776
- Yeah.
- Good?

17:41.233 --> 17:44.111
Kor proposed that on the night,
he would arrive early,

17:44.196 --> 17:46.907
and secure his favorite table
using his hat

17:46.989 --> 17:48.867
while he went to grab their trivia sheet

17:48.949 --> 17:51.370
and drinks for the two of them
from the bar.

17:51.453 --> 17:52.496
Hi, can I help you?

17:52.578 --> 17:56.540
Can I have an orange juice, no pulp,
and a margarita, please?

17:56.625 --> 17:57.833
Coming right up.

18:00.253 --> 18:01.797
Is that a margarita? What is it?

18:01.880 --> 18:03.756
- What did you put in it?
- I don't know... Just make...

18:03.839 --> 18:05.091
I don't know how to make a margarita.

18:05.174 --> 18:07.176
He thought that greeting
Tricia with a drink

18:07.259 --> 18:08.929
would help put her in a good mood,

18:09.261 --> 18:12.349
since she normally shows up at trivia
complaining about something.

18:12.932 --> 18:14.517
My roommates are driving me crazy,

18:14.601 --> 18:17.437
and just, it's one of those days where
you're like, "You don't need to be rude."

18:17.521 --> 18:19.356
I think it's just, like,
we're all human beings here.

18:19.438 --> 18:22.943
And he suggested trying to joke with her
to lighten her spirits.

18:23.026 --> 18:24.778
I would guess I would say...

18:27.321 --> 18:29.115
I'm going to probably
give you a little buzz tonight

18:29.199 --> 18:32.077
because I'm sure someone's
plucking your nerves today.

18:32.493 --> 18:34.204
Okay, is that a joke?
Or just a line--

18:34.286 --> 18:36.414
- It'll be more of a joke.
- Okay.

18:36.872 --> 18:40.793
For every way Tricia could react,
I would input a planned response

18:40.876 --> 18:43.839
from Kor into specialized flowchart
software.

18:44.255 --> 18:45.464
- Hey.
- Hi, Trish the dish.

18:45.882 --> 18:46.967
How you doing?

18:47.049 --> 18:50.177
This would allow us to chart
the optimal path through the evening.

18:50.637 --> 18:53.806
- Are you starting with presidents?
- No, I'm starting with twins.

18:53.889 --> 18:56.059
You went twins
and then go to presidents?

18:56.143 --> 18:57.644
I started with twins and I connected to--

18:57.727 --> 18:58.937
- And then go to the presidents?
- Yeah.

18:59.688 --> 19:03.150
A decision tree that would guide us
towards key milestones

19:03.232 --> 19:04.817
and help us avoid pitfalls.

19:05.152 --> 19:06.445
- Hey. Hi, man.
- Hi. Trish the dish.

19:07.029 --> 19:10.823
Kor had told me there was a chance
Tricia could misinterpret his invitation

19:10.907 --> 19:12.826
as a sign of romantic interest.

19:13.159 --> 19:15.286
She's a single person and I guess...

19:16.705 --> 19:19.957
that after all these years,
I'm inviting her by myself.

19:20.416 --> 19:21.585
Right.

19:21.668 --> 19:24.713
You know I don't drink very much,
you trying to get me drunk?

19:24.796 --> 19:28.425
But when we ran that simulation,
he gave confusing signals.

19:28.799 --> 19:31.053
You're leaving your hand
touching hers right there.

19:31.135 --> 19:34.263
Well, if I move it then
it's going to bring more suspicion to it.

19:34.348 --> 19:36.475
How as a woman,
how would you take that?

19:36.557 --> 19:38.434
If you touched a guy's hand
and he just left it there.

19:39.226 --> 19:41.562
-She could read that as you flirting back.
-Right.

19:42.104 --> 19:44.899
So, I had Kor practice
some standard defenses

19:44.982 --> 19:46.734
to any advance she might make.

19:47.110 --> 19:49.029
I think it's really nice of you
to get me a drink.

19:49.111 --> 19:52.908
I feel like it's... just, yeah,
it's nice to go like, come and...

19:52.990 --> 19:55.202
But, of course, all this was designed

19:55.285 --> 19:58.705
to lay the perfect foundation
for him to confess his lie.

19:58.788 --> 20:00.373
Did I tell you what happened
with my laptop?

20:00.457 --> 20:01.541
No, no idea.

20:01.624 --> 20:02.958
The other day I went to switch it on

20:03.043 --> 20:06.213
and it just didn't switch on, and like,
it was, you know that thing of--

20:06.295 --> 20:08.048
I was in the middle of writing something,

20:08.130 --> 20:10.676
so I'm thinking I'm going to lose
the pictures that are in there--

20:10.758 --> 20:13.303
Well, it's funny that you think
about losing, I wanted.

20:13.386 --> 20:16.431
It sounds heavy, but actually,
don't worry because I...

20:16.514 --> 20:18.141
This story turned around,

20:18.225 --> 20:20.726
like, I didn't actually end up losing
the photos and the stuff,

20:20.811 --> 20:22.269
but I did have to take it to get it fixed.

20:22.354 --> 20:25.774
Kor, I think you need to take control
of the conversation,

20:25.856 --> 20:27.567
she's not going to give you an opening.

20:27.650 --> 20:30.153
If you just let her talk
she's just gonna keep talking, right?

20:30.237 --> 20:31.280
I'll try just one more time.

20:31.362 --> 20:34.532
To see if I can find another pattern into
breaking into the conversation.

20:34.616 --> 20:36.033
Okay. Try it.

20:36.118 --> 20:38.537
Like, he just couldn't make
any kind of conversation

20:38.619 --> 20:40.414
and like, he suddenly said like,
something about, like,

20:40.997 --> 20:43.417
pineapple being a member
of the citrus family, and like--

20:43.500 --> 20:45.877
My educational situation is a fraud.

20:48.838 --> 20:49.965
What?

20:50.923 --> 20:54.343
But just starting his confession
wasn't the only challenge.

20:54.428 --> 20:56.805
Kor was most worried
about the aftermath.

20:56.887 --> 20:58.222
So, our entire approach

20:58.307 --> 21:02.059
had to be planned around the format
of this particular trivia night.

21:02.143 --> 21:06.148
There's usually six questions per round,
it's about four rounds.

21:06.230 --> 21:09.400
After round two, they usually
have a ten to 15-minute break.

21:09.484 --> 21:12.486
We're going to take a ten-minute break,
and I'm going to add up all your scores.

21:12.570 --> 21:16.074
And then during that time,
sometimes we would order some pizza.

21:16.157 --> 21:18.326
Here are your two tickets for pizza.

21:18.743 --> 21:20.996
The ideal thing would be to talk
about it for five minutes

21:21.079 --> 21:22.789
and then, yeah, move on.

21:22.873 --> 21:27.544
I don't want to linger, I just want to say
it and then pretty much have it dropped.

21:27.626 --> 21:29.296
So, you don't have a master's degree?

21:29.379 --> 21:32.215
No. I just don't want you to send me
any more information

21:32.298 --> 21:35.217
about jobs that have a master's degree--

21:35.302 --> 21:38.387
I really want to understand like, why...
how did we end up here?

21:38.472 --> 21:39.765
So, you just want to shut it down.

21:39.848 --> 21:42.184
I want to shut it down.
So, at least if I do it toward the end,

21:42.266 --> 21:45.102
then the benefit is I can leave
if I think, "Okay, too hairy,"

21:45.186 --> 21:48.190
and say, "Oops, I have an appointment
to go to, sorry, I have to go."

21:48.272 --> 21:50.442
I don't owe you an explanation for that,
I really don't.

21:50.525 --> 21:52.443
I owe you an apology
for putting you through that,

21:52.527 --> 21:54.363
but I don't feel
I owe you an explanation.

21:54.446 --> 21:56.322
All right, well, can we like,
discuss it after the trivia?

21:56.406 --> 21:59.576
I don't want to discuss it
any longer about the situation.

21:59.910 --> 22:04.289
So, I'd rather say it at least after the
last round, but before the scores.

22:04.622 --> 22:07.041
All right, start finishing up your ballots

22:07.125 --> 22:09.461
and bring them up to score
when you're ready, all right?

22:09.544 --> 22:14.048
But as soon as we started incorporating
full rounds of trivia into our rehearsal,

22:14.132 --> 22:16.133
it revealed a problem.

22:16.218 --> 22:20.973
What is the number on the roof
of the bus in Speed?

22:21.889 --> 22:26.519
What is the number on the roof
of the bus in Speed?

22:26.894 --> 22:30.899
Kor became entranced by the game,
and when he didn't know an answer,

22:30.982 --> 22:33.026
he couldn't focus on anything else.

22:33.109 --> 22:35.112
That's right, I'm gonna lose
some points on this one.

22:35.194 --> 22:36.822
I thought I would have known,

22:36.905 --> 22:40.033
who hosted Wheel of Fortune
before Pat Sajak.

22:40.116 --> 22:42.451
And I had 10,000 names in my head
but I couldn't pinpoint anybody.

22:42.535 --> 22:46.956
Sure. Okay, well, do you want to go
into the confession?

22:47.373 --> 22:49.250
Or do you want to try that or...

22:51.003 --> 22:52.086
It's the option...

22:52.169 --> 22:55.674
And he grew frustrated that the stress
of having to confess this lie

22:55.756 --> 22:57.842
was affecting his trivia game.

22:57.926 --> 23:01.597
I'm not gonna take the chance
to miss good questions

23:01.680 --> 23:03.724
because I'm having this burden,

23:03.806 --> 23:06.852
because we can actually just lose points
because the concentration is off--

23:06.934 --> 23:08.979
Right, but who cares
if you lose the game?

23:09.312 --> 23:12.398
You got this off your chest,
It's just one night of bar trivia.

23:12.481 --> 23:16.652
No. One night of bar trivia
is sacrosanct to us.

23:16.737 --> 23:17.821
And that's when he told me

23:17.903 --> 23:20.907
that if it wasn't going well
on the actual trivia night,

23:20.991 --> 23:23.493
he might bail
on the confession entirely.

23:23.577 --> 23:25.871
No, I would not...
I'm not sacrificing trivia night.

23:25.953 --> 23:27.998
- Not for that, no.
- Isn't it just for fun?

23:28.080 --> 23:29.957
- Like everyone's drunk, right?
- No.

23:30.042 --> 23:32.085
Then, I'm going to have two things
against me,

23:32.169 --> 23:35.464
I mess up a good trivia night
and I lied to her.

23:36.714 --> 23:39.842
So, to me, I got to take one of them
out of the equation.

23:41.470 --> 23:42.804
Okay.

23:43.721 --> 23:49.019
I had gone to incredible lengths to
eliminate all uncertainty from the night.

23:49.102 --> 23:51.897
But the only way to know
the actual trivia questions

23:51.980 --> 23:55.775
that the real host would be asking
would involve some sort of cheating,

23:56.275 --> 23:58.277
and that would be unethical.

23:59.988 --> 24:03.450
But maybe it's more unethical
to leave things to chance

24:03.532 --> 24:06.286
when there's something
you could have done.

24:09.538 --> 24:13.085
So, posing as the founder
of the popular blog Thrifty Boy,

24:13.167 --> 24:15.836
I arranged an interview
with the real trivia host

24:15.921 --> 24:18.172
at one of the other bars he hosts at

24:18.257 --> 24:22.009
under the pretense of doing
a Thrifty Boy trivia night feature.

24:22.093 --> 24:24.221
Now, is it mandatory to buy drinks?

24:24.304 --> 24:26.514
Because our readers
really don't like to spend money.

24:26.598 --> 24:33.146
We have not had a problem with having
people forced to buy drinks or food.

24:33.479 --> 24:36.316
And does the bar charge
for seltzer water, or is that free?

24:36.399 --> 24:38.110
That's up to each individual
establishment.

24:38.192 --> 24:39.611
- And to-- I think...
- Very cool, okay.

24:39.695 --> 24:43.656
I told him we wanted the profile to
include an interactive video component

24:43.739 --> 24:45.282
in which he would read the questions

24:45.367 --> 24:48.829
for the Alligator Lounge's
upcoming trivia night to camera,

24:48.911 --> 24:51.539
so our readers could play along
at home for free.

24:51.623 --> 24:58.504
What conflict began in 1789
and led to the beheading of Louis XVI?

24:59.506 --> 25:02.967
It was one thing to get the trivia
questions for the big night,

25:03.051 --> 25:06.679
but making sure Kor knew the answers
would be its own challenge.

25:06.763 --> 25:08.723
So, I don't know
why Archie had trouble choosing them

25:08.807 --> 25:11.727
except for the personality
cause they look physically the same.

25:11.809 --> 25:15.647
I knew that cheating at trivia
was something Kor doesn't tangle with.

25:15.980 --> 25:18.941
- Have you ever cheated at trivia?
- No.

25:20.068 --> 25:23.779
So we started going on daily walks
just to chat about life,

25:24.281 --> 25:27.034
but I was actually using
these casual strolls

25:27.117 --> 25:30.328
to covertly implant
every single trivia answer

25:30.411 --> 25:32.623
into Kor's brain without him knowing.

25:32.705 --> 25:35.375
If you ever need to get in,
the code is 1789.

25:35.459 --> 25:36.501
Okay.

25:36.584 --> 25:39.503
Like the year the French Revolution
started in 1789.

25:39.880 --> 25:41.255
I'm not a big summer person.

25:42.048 --> 25:43.382
- And I'm not a big...
- Oh, shit!

25:43.467 --> 25:46.010
- ...spring person.
- It's all over my DKNY pants.

25:47.053 --> 25:50.681
- Donna Karan New York, DKNY.
- Only in New York.

25:51.808 --> 25:53.809
Building's looking pretty tall.

25:55.061 --> 25:57.606
It is tall but it's not the
tallest building in the world.

25:57.688 --> 26:00.107
That'll be the Burj Khalifa in Dubai.

26:00.192 --> 26:06.239
- The Burj Khalifa?
- Yup. The Burj Khalifa. Tallest building.

26:07.615 --> 26:08.658
What's going on here?

26:08.742 --> 26:12.454
It's a hostage situation,
guy has four people at gunpoint.

26:13.371 --> 26:15.206
Shot someone in the head on his way in.

26:15.665 --> 26:17.918
- Oh, my God! That's nuts.
- Oh, my gosh.

26:18.000 --> 26:21.880
It's days like these that I curse
the Chinese for inventing gunpowder.

26:22.339 --> 26:24.006
That's crazy. Oh, my God.

26:24.466 --> 26:26.717
Good luck to you, sir.
Good luck with the whole process.

26:26.802 --> 26:28.637
- Oh, my God.
- Prayers for the family.

26:36.102 --> 26:37.561
With just three days to go

26:37.645 --> 26:41.023
until Kor would meet up with Tricia
at the real Alligator Lounge,

26:41.108 --> 26:46.153
I had over 30 actors occupy the space,
playing customers, servers.

26:46.737 --> 26:51.785
We had real beer on tap and even a
working simulation of their pizza oven.

27:00.835 --> 27:02.546
Each time we ran through the night,

27:02.628 --> 27:06.757
new variables were introduced
that he would have to adapt to.

27:07.633 --> 27:10.846
With a special focus on the moment
when he'd be confessing.

27:11.346 --> 27:14.808
I got to tell you something,
and it's been eating at me for years.

27:14.890 --> 27:16.434
- Oh, yeah?
- Hey guys, how we doing over here?

27:16.518 --> 27:17.561
- Good.
- I'm fine, thank you.

27:17.644 --> 27:19.229
Can we get you another drink?
Can I get you a drink?

27:19.312 --> 27:20.354
I think we're good.

27:20.439 --> 27:24.275
Kor, you don't want the interruption
happening during the confession,

27:24.359 --> 27:27.237
so maybe you make sure your drink
isn't empty at this point in the night.

27:27.321 --> 27:29.364
- Right? So, maybe tiny sips.
- Right.

27:29.447 --> 27:31.574
- Can you just take tinier sips?
- I got it, take tiny sips.

27:32.159 --> 27:35.244
We ran through the entire night 13 times.

27:36.121 --> 27:37.580
But unlike real life,

27:37.664 --> 27:41.417
in here, you can always hit
the reset button and start over.

27:42.127 --> 27:45.005
It was the one place on earth
you couldn't fail.

27:45.921 --> 27:47.214
Orange juice, no pulp.

27:47.591 --> 27:51.470
Hope you don't mind?
I decided to give you a little buzz.

27:52.386 --> 27:54.848
I decided to give you a little buzz.

27:56.891 --> 27:58.769
It's something that's been
eating at me for a long time.

27:58.852 --> 27:59.977
Oh, yeah?

28:01.438 --> 28:04.274
It's been eating at me for this...
forever, and I want to...

28:05.232 --> 28:06.525
I just want to tell you.

28:07.694 --> 28:09.153
- No pulp.
- Okay.

28:09.237 --> 28:11.947
I got to tell you something.
This has been eating at me for years.

28:13.491 --> 28:16.160
My whole educational status
has been a scam.

28:18.746 --> 28:21.959
Just based after my childhood,
I guess there's some issues there.

28:22.042 --> 28:24.543
Some insecurities
I haven't been able to face until now.

28:25.252 --> 28:29.258
As we neared the end, Kor seemed
to be testing new approaches,

28:30.050 --> 28:32.551
but that didn't mean
Tricia always took it well.

28:32.636 --> 28:35.638
I don't understand why you felt the need
to lie about your education.

28:35.721 --> 28:37.599
I mean, it's really messed up.

28:38.516 --> 28:40.935
For years, we were trying
to help you get a job

28:41.019 --> 28:44.563
because you said you had a master's
degree, and that was all bullshit!

28:44.648 --> 28:47.609
Is this what you think a friendship is?

28:47.692 --> 28:50.820
Like, you have no respect for me,
no respect for my time.

28:50.904 --> 28:53.865
I don't give a crap
about your education.

28:54.825 --> 28:59.203
But... but 12 years of deception,
that's... 12 years!

29:00.162 --> 29:04.209
It's unforgivable.
I don't want to talk to you again.

29:04.751 --> 29:06.128
Please don't go.

29:10.131 --> 29:13.968
He lied about having a master's degree.
I just heard their conversation.

29:14.344 --> 29:17.430
- No master's degree?
- This guy is such a fraud.

29:17.514 --> 29:22.143
- Who doesn't have a master's degree?
- And the loser of tonight's trivia is...

29:23.352 --> 29:24.645
Kor Skeet.

29:33.321 --> 29:36.533
Are you sure you want to do this?
For sure?

29:39.327 --> 29:41.370
Well, it still felt good
that I got it off my chest,

29:42.497 --> 29:46.083
even if it means I might lose a friendship
in the process.

29:48.711 --> 29:51.715
Like... I don't think it'll go that bad.

29:53.050 --> 29:54.092
But...

29:55.718 --> 30:00.931
I'm literally going into the unknown,
the pit of the alligator, and...

30:01.808 --> 30:04.560
he's going to swallow me up
or let me go free.

30:27.084 --> 30:30.961
We had planned for Kor to get there
early to secure his chosen table.

30:31.505 --> 30:35.217
But when he arrived, there was
a problem. The table was taken.

30:36.676 --> 30:39.972
Fortunately, we had rehearsed
for this exact scenario.

30:40.430 --> 30:45.936
Sorry to bother you, my grandmother
died of like, brain cancer recently...

30:46.018 --> 30:47.771
...and this, terrible thing.

30:47.853 --> 30:50.816
This table here
is like a sentimental thing.

30:50.899 --> 30:55.194
I know you're all settled here but would
you consider to moving to another area?

30:56.613 --> 30:58.657
- I know it sounds outrageous.
- We can go one table over.

30:58.740 --> 31:00.242
- Yeah, if you want.
- That'd be nice of you.

31:00.324 --> 31:01.450
- Thank you so much.
- No worries.

31:01.535 --> 31:03.536
My grandmother very recently died
of something very similar...

31:04.162 --> 31:05.956
I'm so sorry about that.

31:11.753 --> 31:14.171
- Do you have any orange juice?
- Yes.

31:14.256 --> 31:16.549
Do you have it with no pulp?
Thank you so much.

31:16.633 --> 31:18.468
You just take the tickets up there
for your pizza.

31:18.552 --> 31:19.927
Thank you so much.

31:25.933 --> 31:27.394
Hello!

31:28.811 --> 31:30.313
- Hey!
- Trish the dish.

31:30.813 --> 31:32.440
- Gosh!
- Now what?

31:34.151 --> 31:36.861
I decided to get you a rum and coke,
a little buzz.

31:37.361 --> 31:39.530
Because I'm sure everyone's
been plucking on your nerves,

31:39.615 --> 31:40.657
or someone you know--

31:40.740 --> 31:43.577
Oh my God! Yes,
today has been pretty awful.

32:08.684 --> 32:12.313
As expected, Tricia showed up
not in the best of spirits,

32:13.105 --> 32:16.484
but Kor knew exactly
what to talk about to cheer her up.

32:16.818 --> 32:19.362
The Bush twins.
Yeah, Jenna and Laura.

32:20.530 --> 32:24.825
They're the only two children
of a president, that are twins.

32:26.077 --> 32:28.537
With all the presidents,
sometimes having eight or nine kids.

32:29.038 --> 32:31.792
And none of them had twins
within that range.

32:31.874 --> 32:34.752
Not even stillborn twins,
not even like in that situation.

32:35.128 --> 32:37.588
- So he's the only one.
- That's very... that is very interesting.

32:37.673 --> 32:40.050
Kor was sticking to the script,
and it was working.

32:40.424 --> 32:42.301
He's the earliest president we have

32:42.386 --> 32:45.972
that had like... has grandchildren still
living from that generation.

32:46.056 --> 32:47.099
That is so crazy.

32:47.182 --> 32:49.392
And before long,
it was time for trivia.

32:49.892 --> 32:51.435
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,

32:51.520 --> 32:54.481
the moment you all have been waiting
for, we're going to start playing trivia.

32:55.272 --> 33:00.569
What mode of transportation places the
rider in a laid-back, reclining position,

33:00.654 --> 33:04.908
distributing the rider's weight
comfortably over a large area?

33:06.283 --> 33:08.661
These freaking recumbent bikes
are everywhere.

33:09.620 --> 33:11.123
What mode of transportation

33:11.205 --> 33:15.210
places the rider in a laid-back
reclining position,

33:15.294 --> 33:20.424
distributing the rider's weight
comfortably over a large area?

33:20.507 --> 33:23.844
Probably a train.
I think Amtrak did that but I'm not sure.

33:23.927 --> 33:26.763
Or it could be a bike, or something like
that, one of those reclining bikes?

33:26.846 --> 33:28.807
But you don't really,
recline the seat of a bike.

33:28.890 --> 33:29.933
Yeah.

33:30.016 --> 33:31.935
Kor was slightly off
on the first question,

33:32.519 --> 33:36.148
and I was worried these answers
weren't fully absorbed into his brain.

33:36.564 --> 33:39.776
The correct answer
to that is a recumbent bike.

33:39.859 --> 33:41.653
- This is like, really--
- Yeah, I knew it was a bike.

33:41.736 --> 33:44.489
But I... I know... I've seen it,
but I couldn't imagine the name.

33:44.572 --> 33:47.158
- I've heard the name.
- I wouldn't know the name.

33:47.241 --> 33:49.620
But then,
things started to turn around.

33:49.703 --> 33:52.371
The correct answer
is the French Revolution.

33:53.915 --> 33:54.999
Look at you!

33:55.709 --> 33:57.626
The correct answer, gunpowder.

33:59.004 --> 34:02.089
And the correct answer
to that is called Burj Khalifa.

34:02.174 --> 34:03.216
Good!

34:04.717 --> 34:08.972
It was an amazing streak that continued
until the end of round four,

34:09.055 --> 34:11.099
and he seemed
to be brimming with confidence

34:11.182 --> 34:14.186
by the time he got up to hand
in his score sheet,

34:14.268 --> 34:17.396
marking the start of his window
to come clean.

34:18.230 --> 34:20.066
Thank you. I'll be right back.

34:21.067 --> 34:23.736
In our fake bar,
we had practiced an option

34:23.820 --> 34:27.323
where he would get pizza for both
of them right after the fourth round,

34:27.406 --> 34:31.370
so it would be easier for him to initiate
the confession while her mouth was full,

34:32.244 --> 34:36.667
and since she was in a chatty mood, it
seemed like he had decided to go for it.

34:37.376 --> 34:41.629
- Two cheese pizzas, please.
- Two cheese? Okay, ten minutes.

34:41.712 --> 34:43.674
- Okay.
- But then, something happened.

34:49.179 --> 34:54.225
When he returned to the table to wait
for his pizzas, Tricia wasn't talking.

34:55.102 --> 34:59.273
It was the perfect opportunity to begin
his confession, but for some reason,

34:59.939 --> 35:01.316
he wasn't doing it.

35:04.402 --> 35:05.821
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Okay.

35:06.487 --> 35:09.281
The pizza tastes better
after a certain period of time,

35:09.365 --> 35:13.953
the pizza's good but then, after a couple
of rounds, it really hits it in...

35:15.371 --> 35:18.749
Hits it to the last spot.
Especially after a couple rums and cokes.

35:43.649 --> 35:46.777
And as the clock kept ticking,
he just sat there.

36:15.599 --> 36:20.102
In this case, ask over the lady
who'd take the pizza, the faster it comes.

36:23.023 --> 36:24.524
Oh, my gosh.

36:33.825 --> 36:38.913
There's been, something on my mind
I've had to deal with and...

36:39.955 --> 36:41.708
you know, maybe it's there?

36:41.792 --> 36:43.251
Is it this one?

36:44.043 --> 36:45.379
Hang on a second.

36:46.421 --> 36:47.965
Okay. Okay.

36:48.548 --> 36:50.675
Almost around the corner.

36:56.306 --> 36:57.349
What's up?

36:57.766 --> 37:00.101
They ring the bell, they're getting closer
to making the pizza.

37:00.184 --> 37:02.311
Well, I guess so.
Now what were you saying before?

37:02.728 --> 37:08.860
I feel bad that... this has been bothering
me a long time to tell you this.

37:08.943 --> 37:09.986
What's that?

37:10.069 --> 37:13.907
My whole educational life has been,
kind of a fraud.

37:13.991 --> 37:15.783
- Really?
- Yeah.

37:16.660 --> 37:20.330
Remember when I was showing pictures
of my graduation a couple years ago?

37:20.747 --> 37:21.790
In front of the gang
and everything like that?

37:21.873 --> 37:22.916
Yeah.

37:22.999 --> 37:26.962
And then you asked at the time,
said that I got a master's degree.

37:27.837 --> 37:31.758
- And I kind of went along with it.
- Really?

37:31.842 --> 37:32.925
Yeah.

37:33.509 --> 37:36.930
I felt kind of bad because I didn't want
to level with you about that.

37:37.014 --> 37:38.222
Okay. Well...

37:38.306 --> 37:41.475
I was only going for my bachelor's
degree at the time.

37:43.103 --> 37:44.187
It's still pretty impressive.

37:44.271 --> 37:46.647
I mean, you know, lots of people
don't have master's degrees.

37:46.732 --> 37:50.068
It's cool, I'm not surprised, because I
thought you had a master's but...

37:50.693 --> 37:52.945
Hang on a second, one second.

37:54.280 --> 37:55.364
Yeah, thank you.

37:55.448 --> 37:56.617
- Two cheese?
- Yes. Thank you.

38:12.382 --> 38:15.594
I didn't realize you didn't have your
master's degree, cause I thought you did.

38:15.676 --> 38:17.219
That's what you said before.

38:17.303 --> 38:20.307
Yeah, yeah, I've... see the thing is that,
what made it worse was

38:20.389 --> 38:22.309
I came into the group,
the trivia group,

38:22.392 --> 38:25.144
I was, like, the last person
that even had a college degree.

38:25.603 --> 38:27.688
And I kind of felt
like inferior about that.

38:27.772 --> 38:29.440
That's so silly,
don't you feel upset about that.

38:29.524 --> 38:30.775
Lots of people
barely even finish high school.

38:30.858 --> 38:34.363
My sister only got her GED
like two years ago. You know?

38:34.445 --> 38:38.824
Well, I just, you know, and I kept
that lie going on all that time.

38:38.909 --> 38:42.828
And it kind of ate at me and then, you
helped me, you know, apply for jobs,

38:42.912 --> 38:46.540
so it actually went that far to even
send my résumé just to appease you.

38:46.624 --> 38:48.919
I appreciate that so much,
I had no idea.

38:49.627 --> 38:51.463
And I feel you know? I just...

38:53.422 --> 38:54.882
My friendship with you means
a great deal.

38:54.966 --> 38:56.008
Me too.

38:56.093 --> 38:59.429
And I don't want you to think that I would
even continue lying to you.

38:59.512 --> 39:02.474
But I've been living this lie all this
time and I kind of felt bad about that.

39:02.557 --> 39:04.308
Well, it's so sweet to finally tell me
about it. I had no idea.

39:04.393 --> 39:07.353
Iyt's very brave of you to tell me this,
and I really had no clue.

39:07.436 --> 39:09.856
Instead of trying
to move on to another topic,

39:09.939 --> 39:12.859
Kor sat with her
for the next hour-and-a-half

39:12.943 --> 39:16.153
and began sharing things
that he had never told Tricia

39:16.237 --> 39:18.532
in their nearly 20 years of friendship.

39:18.864 --> 39:22.869
And my father used the situation
where he sent the child support,

39:22.952 --> 39:26.373
which could be for my college education,
for me and my sister.

39:26.832 --> 39:30.085
And by the time we came of age,
he doesn't want to pay for it.

39:30.168 --> 39:32.671
That's rough.
I'm sorry to hear that. I really am.

39:33.088 --> 39:36.216
And what made it worse
was when I was graduating...

39:42.472 --> 39:43.889
While we were practicing,

39:43.973 --> 39:49.103
I also had Kor rehearse the aftermath of
his confession beyond the actual night.

39:51.147 --> 39:53.525
Whether it be the torment
of a friendship lost...

39:56.236 --> 39:59.281
or the joy
of a friendship strengthened.

39:59.781 --> 40:01.992
Where his confession opens
the floodgates

40:02.326 --> 40:04.953
to actually talking for the first time.

40:05.037 --> 40:07.913
This is so nice, it's like,
like such a difference from just normally

40:07.998 --> 40:11.417
when we're hanging out in the city in a
bar, just playing trivia and...

40:11.877 --> 40:16.006
Maybe it's easiest to choose a path
when you can live the future first.

40:17.798 --> 40:20.468
To free yourself from doubt and regret,

40:21.803 --> 40:23.722
to always know the answers.

40:23.805 --> 40:26.808
As a symbol of support
for those living with AIDS and HIV.

40:26.892 --> 40:28.184
So, what is a ribbon?

40:28.518 --> 40:30.562
- Oh, yeah.
- Red ribbons.

40:30.646 --> 40:33.273
I would have lost a point on the color.

40:36.984 --> 40:39.737
- So, how are you feeling?
- Fantastic.

40:40.279 --> 40:45.035
We actually did better than expected,
when we actually won.

40:45.661 --> 40:46.911
Well, congrats.

40:46.994 --> 40:49.455
Yeah. There were questions
that were in my wheelhouse.

40:49.538 --> 40:50.916
The questions that were
in my wheelhouse,

40:50.999 --> 40:54.835
I was able to answer
those particular questions correctly.

40:55.545 --> 40:58.674
You got everything off your chest,
and it must feel good.

40:59.216 --> 41:03.219
I got it off my chest,
and I still won that night.

41:03.887 --> 41:04.972
- Trivia--
- Which is an ex--

41:05.055 --> 41:08.933
I won a trivia night, and that's the extra
cherry on the sundae, I guess.

41:12.019 --> 41:14.188
There's something I need to...

41:14.898 --> 41:16.148
come clean about.

41:19.235 --> 41:22.698
So, I knew what the trivia answers
were going to be tonight

41:22.781 --> 41:25.658
and I taught you them
in advance without you knowing,

41:26.201 --> 41:28.619
and I know you're against cheating

41:28.703 --> 41:32.624
and this isn't cheating because you
actually didn't know I was doing it,

41:32.708 --> 41:36.585
but I was just... wanted you
to focus on the confession,

41:36.670 --> 41:41.049
and I wanted your confidence to be up,
but I feel terrible about it, and I just..

41:41.132 --> 41:43.510
I'm sorry. I want to say I'm sorry.

41:48.181 --> 41:49.182
Yeah.

41:51.351 --> 41:54.396
Okay, I understand
what you're saying and...

41:55.397 --> 41:57.982
I appreciate your motivation, but...

41:58.692 --> 42:01.944
you've tainted,
you've ruined the whole thing for me,

42:02.321 --> 42:07.034
because I knew the answers,
I knew the answers and I'm on TV now,

42:07.117 --> 42:09.536
and everybody now is going to think
that I didn't know them,

42:09.620 --> 42:11.370
that I'm a fake and you...

42:11.454 --> 42:13.165
You know how important
this was for me?

42:13.790 --> 42:18.627
This is a mistake. It was a huge mistake,
and you fucked this all up.

42:20.547 --> 42:22.298
You're an awful...

42:23.800 --> 42:24.884
awful person.

42:42.818 --> 42:45.530
I think you're... a great guy.

42:46.657 --> 42:48.241
Like you're a great person.

42:49.284 --> 42:53.079
- Well, thank you for the compliment.
- Yeah, just...

42:54.539 --> 42:56.332
I don't give compliments a lot,

42:56.416 --> 43:00.253
so I wanted to come clean
about just kind of saying the compliment.

43:00.336 --> 43:03.589
I don't affirm people enough.
Yeah, so...

43:04.883 --> 43:07.760
- It's just kind of like-- Yeah.
- That's nice of you to say.

43:08.595 --> 43:10.262
- Thank you,
- You are, you are.

43:10.972 --> 43:13.225
- That's very touching.
- Of course.
