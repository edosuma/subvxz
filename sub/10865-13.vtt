[Gasps]

00:33.760 --> 00:34.760
Both: Oh. Sorry.

00:34.760 --> 00:35.960
My fault.

00:35.960 --> 00:39.640
Excuse me. I'm gonna
go get some more wood.

00:40.760 --> 00:42.040
Did you tell her?

00:42.040 --> 00:44.880
Oh, yeah. I said...

00:44.880 --> 00:48.360
I said, "Sam, we've known
each other for a long time now,

00:48.360 --> 00:50.880
"and you know how
I feel about you,

00:50.880 --> 00:54.000
so maybe we should decide if
we should go out for real."

00:54.000 --> 00:55.360
Yeah, and?

00:55.360 --> 00:57.000
She said she liked me,

00:57.000 --> 00:59.680
but didn't want to get
into a relationship,

00:59.680 --> 01:01.880
because she had
a lot going on, and...

01:01.880 --> 01:03.080
Who cares why.

01:03.080 --> 01:05.560
She doesn't want
anything to do with me.

01:05.560 --> 01:07.360
I should never...

01:07.360 --> 01:09.400
We're here.
Let the games begin.

01:09.400 --> 01:10.800
Who's up tonight?

01:10.800 --> 01:12.160
I am.

01:16.720 --> 01:19.800
I've been saving this story
for a long time,

01:19.800 --> 01:23.120
and I think tonight's
the best night to tell it.

01:23.120 --> 01:26.960
It's a story about illusion
and deception.

01:29.960 --> 01:31.560
Some things may look familiar,

01:31.560 --> 01:33.840
but they could
be hiding a secret

01:33.840 --> 01:36.160
that you'd never expect.

01:40.600 --> 01:43.560
It could be beautiful
or mysterious,

01:43.560 --> 01:47.880
or like in my story,
something evil.

01:51.280 --> 01:55.440
Submitted for the approval
of the Midnight Society,

01:55.440 --> 01:57.080
I call this story...

02:03.640 --> 02:04.440
[Siren]

02:11.640 --> 02:12.880
<i>P.A.: Your attention, please.</i>

02:12.880 --> 02:14.520

<i> All visitors are asked
to leave the hospital</i>

02:17.200 --> 02:19.080
<i> by the main entrance.</i>

02:21.200 --> 02:22.360
Felix?

02:28.720 --> 02:30.240
Is this your
signature, zebo?

02:30.240 --> 02:31.280
Uh, yeah.

02:31.280 --> 02:32.400
You signed
for a water pump.

02:32.400 --> 02:33.760
Did I say you could sign
for shipments?

02:33.760 --> 02:35.280
No, but...

02:35.280 --> 02:37.280
But you did--
now it's gone.

02:37.280 --> 02:38.760
But the thing
is huge.

02:38.760 --> 02:41.960
Find it, Zebo, or find
yourself another job.

02:44.040 --> 02:45.760
Oh, hi, Amanda.
Bye, Amanda.

02:45.760 --> 02:48.400
Hi, Felix.
Well, hold it.

02:48.400 --> 02:50.640
Me too, me too.

02:50.640 --> 02:52.640
Oh, I'm late again.

02:52.640 --> 02:55.640
I just can't get used
to this night shift.

02:55.640 --> 02:58.520
I mean,
how do you do it?

02:58.520 --> 03:00.520
Oh, I've got school
till 3:00,

03:00.520 --> 03:02.080
then practice, homework
and dinner.

03:02.080 --> 03:06.320
If I want to volunteer,
it's the night shift.

03:06.320 --> 03:08.640
When do you sleep?

03:08.640 --> 03:09.640
I'm not sure.

03:09.640 --> 03:12.320
Let me check
my schedule.

03:20.800 --> 03:22.080
I'm sorry I'm late.

03:22.080 --> 03:24.080
Number 3 won't
take his meds,

03:24.080 --> 03:25.720
his roomie's
got a fever,

03:25.720 --> 03:28.200
number 7's in pre-op,
and number 5--

03:28.200 --> 03:29.720
wants her mommy.

03:29.720 --> 03:32.720
I thought the night shift
was supposed to be quiet.

03:32.720 --> 03:34.240
Amanda?

03:36.040 --> 03:37.600
We've got a
new volunteer.

03:37.600 --> 03:39.520
I want you
to show her around.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.680
Margot, Amanda--
Amanda, Margot.

03:42.680 --> 03:45.200
Now you're old chums.
Don't annoy me.

03:45.200 --> 03:46.320
Hi.

03:46.320 --> 03:47.080
Hi.

03:47.840 --> 03:49.800
You picked
the night shift too?

03:49.800 --> 03:53.200
Yeah. School kind of takes
up a lot of the day.

03:53.200 --> 03:54.720
Tell me about it.

03:54.720 --> 03:55.720
Amanda?

03:55.720 --> 03:57.800
I'll be right back.

04:13.400 --> 04:16.040
How do you lose
an entire water pump?

04:29.040 --> 04:31.880
This is from the crate
it came in.

04:33.720 --> 04:34.760
But how did it get--

04:34.760 --> 04:36.120
Hi, Felix.

04:38.680 --> 04:41.240
Come here. I want
to show you something.

04:59.040 --> 05:02.320
You know, I don't
think we're supposed...

05:04.680 --> 05:08.280
Hey. Guy in number 59 says
he's a friend of yours.

05:08.280 --> 05:09.280
Who is he?

05:09.280 --> 05:11.960
Go see. He's cute.

05:18.880 --> 05:20.160
Hello?

05:21.480 --> 05:22.760
Amanda?

05:24.560 --> 05:26.120
Is that you?

05:26.120 --> 05:27.880
Colin?

05:30.240 --> 05:32.200
What's wrong?

05:34.000 --> 05:38.680
Tomorrow... getting
tonsils out.

05:38.680 --> 05:40.120
I'm so sorry, I...

05:40.120 --> 05:41.360
What?

05:42.560 --> 05:44.160
And you can
take care of me.

05:44.160 --> 05:45.320
You want
some candy corn?

05:45.320 --> 05:46.600
Jerk.

05:46.600 --> 05:48.600
Come on. It was a goof.

05:48.600 --> 05:50.600
No, you're a goof,
and I'm busy.

05:50.600 --> 05:52.600
You're always busy.
I need comfort.

05:52.600 --> 05:54.120
I don't think so.

05:54.120 --> 05:55.640
You got to be nice
to me.

05:55.640 --> 05:57.640
I might not make it
through surgery.

05:57.640 --> 05:58.920
Yeah, I wish.

06:01.040 --> 06:02.640
Hello.

06:04.640 --> 06:05.760
Hello.

06:07.800 --> 06:09.840
What room are you in,
sweetheart?

06:11.720 --> 06:14.920
Hey, you're not
supposed to...

06:23.640 --> 06:25.760
Are we playing
hide and seek?

06:36.120 --> 06:38.720
I'm gonna get you.

06:40.120 --> 06:43.440
I'm gonna scare you...

06:50.120 --> 06:52.080
All I want is one date--

06:52.080 --> 06:53.560
a movie, pizza, anything.

06:53.560 --> 06:57.240
<i>If you hate me after that,
I'll leave you alone forever.</i>

06:57.240 --> 06:58.880
Colin,
I told you before.

06:58.880 --> 07:00.680
I think
you're a nice guy,

07:00.680 --> 07:02.320
but I am too busy.

07:02.320 --> 07:04.600
Too busy for what,
to have fun?

07:04.600 --> 07:07.160
Incoming!

07:07.160 --> 07:10.760
Sorry. He got
away from me.

07:10.760 --> 07:15.000
This place is so boring.
Let's go to the morgue.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
I've got him.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.160
Come on, speedy.

07:19.280 --> 07:21.200
You're a patient.
Pretend you're sick

07:21.200 --> 07:24.520
before we all
get in trouble.

07:24.520 --> 07:25.270
OK,

07:26.200 --> 07:28.760
but I'm not giving up
till you give in.

07:30.920 --> 07:32.040
[Gasps]

07:32.040 --> 07:34.000
Oh, man, you scared me.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
That guy's in my class.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.600
He's been bugging me
for months about...

07:40.600 --> 07:41.680
Laurette?

08:04.880 --> 08:06.640
Sorry. It's only me.

08:06.640 --> 08:08.440
Stop bugging me.

08:08.440 --> 08:09.480
Go to bed.

08:09.480 --> 08:10.480
My roommate's gone.

08:10.480 --> 08:12.080
What do you mean, gone?

08:12.080 --> 08:13.120
Who's your roommate?

08:13.120 --> 08:15.400
Bud, the kid
with the broken leg.

08:15.400 --> 08:19.360
He took off about an hour
ago, and didn't come back.

08:19.360 --> 08:20.680
I'll tell Nurse Hantin.

08:20.680 --> 08:23.360
I don't want to get him
in trouble.

08:23.360 --> 08:25.000
Can't we go find him?

08:25.000 --> 08:27.280
Oh, come on.
He's just having fun,

08:27.280 --> 08:30.680
but I guess you wouldn't
know about stuff like that.

08:32.200 --> 08:35.960
All right.
If I get in trouble,

08:35.960 --> 08:39.520
I'll cut out
your tonsils myself.

08:42.919 --> 08:44.520
Bud?

08:46.240 --> 08:47.480
Bud?

08:47.480 --> 08:49.480
Hey, this is like
the first time

08:49.480 --> 08:50.960
we're doing
something together.

08:50.960 --> 08:52.960
Yeah.
My life is complete.

08:52.960 --> 08:54.440
[Creaking]

08:54.440 --> 08:55.520
Look out!

09:01.160 --> 09:03.200
[Giggling]

09:05.720 --> 09:08.480
So, alone at last.

09:09.480 --> 09:11.400
How can you
eat those things?

09:11.400 --> 09:12.920
It's not even
Halloween.

09:12.920 --> 09:14.400
I'm a rebel.

09:14.400 --> 09:17.800
No, you're a geek who's
gonna get me in trouble...

09:19.160 --> 09:20.360
What is this?

09:22.200 --> 09:24.080
What are they?

09:24.080 --> 09:26.760
Blood storage bags.

09:26.760 --> 09:29.160
Yuck. Looks like
a rat got them.

09:29.160 --> 09:31.440
Why do they keep them
in here?

09:31.440 --> 09:33.800
They don't. Something's
gone wrong.

09:37.040 --> 09:38.160
Nurse Hantin?

09:39.680 --> 09:41.440
I found this
in the closet, empty.

09:41.440 --> 09:43.800
There's a ton of them
in there.

09:43.800 --> 09:47.040
Really? How strange.

09:47.040 --> 09:49.320
They're shredded,
like a dog got them.

09:49.320 --> 09:51.640
I think we better
call security.

09:51.640 --> 09:56.040
You're right, Amanda.
I'll do that.

10:13.680 --> 10:14.920
Hey.

10:14.920 --> 10:15.920
[Gasps]

10:15.920 --> 10:17.920
Sorry. Why are you
so jumpy?

10:17.920 --> 10:19.440
I don't know.

10:19.440 --> 10:21.440
Something weird
is going on.

10:21.440 --> 10:23.800
Did Bud come back?

10:23.800 --> 10:27.560
No. But I know
where he might be.

10:32.480 --> 10:35.520
It's the one place
he wanted to see.

10:44.320 --> 10:46.960
Well, he's not here.
Let's go.

10:46.960 --> 10:49.560
Wait. Is that a body?

10:49.560 --> 10:52.280
No, it's a pinball
machine. Come on.

10:52.280 --> 10:54.560
I've never seen
a dead body before.

10:54.560 --> 10:56.080
Colin?

10:57.800 --> 10:59.400
Colin, don't.

11:01.440 --> 11:04.480
It's no big deal.
It's just a dead body.

11:04.480 --> 11:06.160
It's Felix.

11:07.720 --> 11:08.800
Who?

11:08.800 --> 11:09.800
Felix.

11:09.800 --> 11:11.680
He works in maintenance.

11:11.680 --> 11:15.760
Now anymore.
He's, like, really dead.

11:15.760 --> 11:20.720
I just saw him tonight,
and he was fine.

11:23.960 --> 11:25.720
Let's get out of here.

11:45.680 --> 11:47.600
[Hissing]

11:51.680 --> 11:53.000
Nurse Hantin?

11:54.440 --> 11:55.760
Laurette?

11:59.120 --> 12:00.960
It's dead.

12:00.960 --> 12:02.480
Just like old Felix.

12:02.480 --> 12:04.000
Colin.

12:04.000 --> 12:07.520
Sorry. This whole place is
starting to feel like a morgue.

12:07.520 --> 12:09.840
Security should have
been here by now.

12:09.840 --> 12:12.840
I don't like this.
Let's go downstairs.

12:12.840 --> 12:14.400
Evening, Amanda.

12:14.400 --> 12:17.360
Jack, what happened
to Felix?

12:17.360 --> 12:18.880
Felix?

12:18.880 --> 12:21.520
Felix is just fine.

12:21.520 --> 12:23.720
It depends on your
definition of fine.

12:23.720 --> 12:25.200
Why don't we go see him?

12:25.200 --> 12:27.520
You go. Tell him
we say hi.

12:32.800 --> 12:34.360
What is with that guy?

12:34.360 --> 12:36.360
I don't know.
This is weird.

12:36.360 --> 12:38.920
Let's just go down
to the lobby...

12:38.920 --> 12:40.640
[Door closes]

12:44.680 --> 12:46.520
Hello, Amanda.

12:46.520 --> 12:50.360
Felix... but you're,
you're...

12:50.360 --> 12:52.400
Dead?

12:52.400 --> 12:53.400
[Chuckles]

12:53.400 --> 12:55.680
Sort of.

13:00.080 --> 13:02.160
How can you be
sort of dead?

13:02.160 --> 13:04.600
Oh, it's not so bad,
really.

13:04.600 --> 13:07.960
You'll soon find out
for yourself.

13:07.960 --> 13:09.400
Felix!

13:09.400 --> 13:12.800
What are you doing, man?
What is your problem?

13:12.800 --> 13:15.000
[Chuckling]

13:15.000 --> 13:17.160
My problem is
I was the first.

13:17.160 --> 13:18.800
The first what?

13:20.480 --> 13:23.640
I drank too much,
and it made me like this.

13:23.640 --> 13:27.000
Felix,
we'll get you a doctor.

13:27.000 --> 13:30.520
There are no doctors.

13:30.520 --> 13:35.040
There are no nurses, there are
no patients. There's nobody left!

13:35.040 --> 13:37.520
It's been feeding
on everybody,

13:37.520 --> 13:39.880
but only enough
to control them,

13:39.880 --> 13:42.120
not enough
to cause a panic.

13:42.120 --> 13:44.800
Once it gets everybody,

13:44.800 --> 13:46.920
it's gonna come back.

13:46.920 --> 13:48.640
It's gonna
finish them off!

13:48.640 --> 13:50.760
Who? What are you
talking about?

13:52.760 --> 13:55.360
Maybe it's not too late.
It hasn't gotten you.

13:55.360 --> 13:56.960
Maybe you can stop it!

13:56.960 --> 13:58.880
Easy, pal.

13:58.880 --> 14:01.360
Felix, you're scaring me.

14:01.360 --> 14:02.920
Amanda?

14:04.080 --> 14:05.880
Amanda, please come with me.

14:08.760 --> 14:09.920
I'm getting weaker.

14:09.920 --> 14:13.080
I don't know how much longer
I can fight it.

14:13.080 --> 14:15.040
Fight what?

14:17.880 --> 14:19.160
I'm changing...

14:20.720 --> 14:23.840
And if someone
doesn't stop it...

14:23.840 --> 14:25.680
It will do...

14:35.640 --> 14:38.520
It shipped itself here,
can you believe it?

14:40.720 --> 14:43.560
The box said
it was a water pump.

14:47.200 --> 14:52.040
Funny thing is, I'm the
one who signed for it.

14:53.080 --> 14:55.160
Yeah, that's real funny.

14:59.640 --> 15:02.560
You guys are not
gonna believe this,

15:02.560 --> 15:03.840
but you have to.

15:08.560 --> 15:11.400
It's a vampire,
Amanda,

15:11.400 --> 15:13.400
and it's hunting
in the hospital.

15:13.400 --> 15:14.800
Get out of here.

15:14.800 --> 15:17.040
You want me
to prove it to you?

15:17.040 --> 15:19.200
I'm fighting the change,
but I can easily--

15:19.200 --> 15:20.840
Stop!

15:24.720 --> 15:27.240
The only thing it needs
is that coffin.

15:27.240 --> 15:29.120
If we can destroy it,
then--

15:29.120 --> 15:32.320
Amanda? Are you down there?

15:33.440 --> 15:35.600
Margot, are you OK?

15:35.600 --> 15:39.040
Sure. Felix is wrong,
you know.

15:40.800 --> 15:43.600
Of course a vampire
needs its coffin,

15:43.600 --> 15:47.000
but it also needs blood.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
What?

15:48.000 --> 15:49.640
People have it
all wrong.

15:49.640 --> 15:55.040
Vampires only need to feed
about every 50 years or so,

15:55.040 --> 15:59.360
and isn't a hospital
a great place for it?

15:59.360 --> 16:02.560
It's like a candy store.

16:02.560 --> 16:04.120
Who are you?

16:04.120 --> 16:06.240
I made a mistake
with Felix.

16:06.240 --> 16:10.520
He shouldn't have
turned so soon.

16:10.520 --> 16:11.520
It doesn't matter.

16:11.520 --> 16:13.880
I'm almost done here,
anyway.

16:13.880 --> 16:16.200
We're gonna go upstairs.

16:16.200 --> 16:19.120
I don't think so.

16:19.120 --> 16:22.200
We haven't been properly
introduced yet.

16:26.560 --> 16:29.040
[Laughing]

16:31.320 --> 16:33.480
I should finish
what I started.

16:33.480 --> 16:35.600
No! No!

16:35.600 --> 16:37.920
[Felix screaming]

16:41.760 --> 16:44.960
Sorry, kids.
No one leaves.

16:49.200 --> 16:51.240
Are we
the only ones left?

16:51.240 --> 16:53.960
Colin? I'm scared.

16:53.960 --> 16:55.280
Yeah, me too.

16:55.280 --> 16:58.640
This isn't exactly the
first date I had in mind.

16:58.640 --> 17:02.200
If we get the chance
for a second.

17:02.200 --> 17:03.640
The coffin.

17:03.640 --> 17:05.000
The what?

17:05.000 --> 17:07.720
If we destroy it,
we destroy the vampire.

17:07.720 --> 17:09.839
But it won't let
anyone near it.

17:09.839 --> 17:11.240
Except there's 2 of us.

17:11.240 --> 17:12.720
If I lure the vampire away,

17:12.720 --> 17:14.839
you can drag the coffin
into the incinerator.

17:14.839 --> 17:17.839
There's no way I can
move that big thing.

17:21.200 --> 17:23.119
But maybe you can.

17:23.119 --> 17:26.760
I'll lure the vampire away;
You can move the coffin.

17:26.760 --> 17:29.000
Amanda, if it gets you,
you're dead.

17:29.000 --> 17:32.800
If we don't stop it,
we're both dead.

17:34.480 --> 17:37.080
Got any more candy corn?

17:38.600 --> 17:41.280
Sugar. We're gonna lure
this thing.

17:59.280 --> 18:01.880
Hey, maybe you should
come with us.

18:04.560 --> 18:07.840
Tell your friend
I'll be upstairs.

18:07.840 --> 18:09.600
Tell me yourself.

18:22.280 --> 18:25.640
That's not a good idea.

18:28.360 --> 18:31.760
I got to see the morgue,
for real.

18:32.800 --> 18:36.960
I'm beginning to like
the night shift.

18:39.760 --> 18:41.400
You wanted to see me?

18:46.600 --> 18:47.560
[Sirens]

19:14.200 --> 19:16.240
[Hissing]

19:22.240 --> 19:25.880
It'll be less painful
if you give in.

19:31.560 --> 19:33.440
[Laughter]

19:34.680 --> 19:36.680
You wanted proof?

19:36.680 --> 19:38.240
Here it comes.

19:39.560 --> 19:42.000
There's no use in running.

19:42.000 --> 19:45.560
I'm far too good a hunter.

19:45.560 --> 19:47.360
[Laughing]

19:47.360 --> 19:49.520
Felix, don't.

19:54.720 --> 20:00.360
I don't like to work
so hard for my kills.

20:04.960 --> 20:07.200
It's gonna get Amanda,
Felix.

20:07.200 --> 20:09.720
Bite me, and Amanda's done.

20:09.720 --> 20:11.160
[Groaning]

20:11.160 --> 20:13.040
Hush.

20:13.040 --> 20:14.760
[Laughing]

20:19.400 --> 20:20.760
[Screaming] Please!

20:22.000 --> 20:24.600
You're still in there,
aren't you?

20:24.600 --> 20:26.840
Help me save her.

20:31.080 --> 20:32.720
Please!

20:32.720 --> 20:34.040
No!

20:34.040 --> 20:37.000
I should drop you, and
then lick up what's left.

20:37.000 --> 20:37.720
No!

20:46.680 --> 20:47.440
No.

20:48.160 --> 20:51.600
The old-fashioned way
is best.

20:51.600 --> 20:53.600
[Hissing]

21:00.000 --> 21:02.600
[Screaming]

21:02.600 --> 21:05.400
[Groaning]

21:08.520 --> 21:09.840
[Screaming]

21:33.920 --> 21:35.640
Incoming!

21:37.360 --> 21:40.160
I really thought the night
shift was supposed to be quiet.

21:40.160 --> 21:41.280
Are you OK?

21:41.280 --> 21:43.520
Nothing a little sleep
wouldn't cure.

21:43.520 --> 21:45.400
Amanda?

21:46.720 --> 21:48.640
What happened
to the new girl?

21:48.640 --> 21:50.760
Did I scare her
off already?

21:50.760 --> 21:52.120
Yeah, something
like that.

21:52.120 --> 21:52.960
Amanda?

21:56.560 --> 21:58.120
Are you OK?
What happened?

21:58.120 --> 22:00.880
It's over. Everybody's
back to normal.

22:00.880 --> 22:04.760
They don't even remember
what happened.

22:04.760 --> 22:06.560
There you are!

22:08.400 --> 22:10.560
Finish mopping the lobby,

22:10.560 --> 22:13.760
or I'll find somebody
who knows how to work.

22:16.800 --> 22:18.240
I remember.

22:19.560 --> 22:21.040
Thanks.

22:22.600 --> 22:25.200
So, what was that
about a second date?

22:25.200 --> 22:28.360
I'll have to
check my schedule...

22:31.600 --> 22:35.720
But I'm pretty sure
I can squeeze you in.

22:45.440 --> 22:46.680
Sam: The end.

22:46.680 --> 22:48.520
Great. Cool.

22:50.640 --> 22:51.880
Gary.

22:53.640 --> 22:56.000
Could you wait a sec?

22:56.000 --> 22:58.800
Um, yeah, I guess.

22:58.800 --> 23:00.920
Both: Ooh.

23:00.920 --> 23:02.920
Keep walking.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.960
It's getting
a little hot.

23:07.960 --> 23:09.680
Come on.

23:13.680 --> 23:19.680
Um, that story was about
someone so busy being busy,

23:19.680 --> 23:21.600
they miss a lot
of possibilities.

23:21.600 --> 23:22.600
Yeah?

23:22.600 --> 23:25.400
Well, I was thinking

23:25.400 --> 23:26.680
about what you said...

23:26.680 --> 23:30.840
And maybe you and I have
some possibilities.

23:32.640 --> 23:34.560
Really? That's great.

23:34.560 --> 23:37.160
Why don't I
put out the fire--

23:37.160 --> 23:38.880
No, not yet.

23:41.280 --> 23:44.440
I want to watch it
a little while longer.
