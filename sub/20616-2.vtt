WEBVTT

00:10.445 --> 00:13.045
I'm getting violence.

00:13.047 --> 00:16.181
It could harm the living,
physically.

00:16.184 --> 00:18.284
I feel like this house
killed my husband.

00:18.286 --> 00:20.486
This female feels suicidal.

00:21.956 --> 00:23.556
He was the love
of my life.

00:23.558 --> 00:24.991
I blame myself
for him.

00:26.594 --> 00:28.861
I could feel
a rope around my neck.

00:28.863 --> 00:31.764
It felt like something
went through me.

00:31.766 --> 00:34.233
I don't want anything
to happen to my daughter.

00:34.903 --> 00:36.636
"This can't be happening.
No way."

00:37.972 --> 00:40.239
This is not
a good situation.

00:40.241 --> 00:42.408
My name is Amy Allan.

00:42.410 --> 00:43.709
There's death here.

00:43.711 --> 00:45.511
Don't want to
go down there.

00:45.513 --> 00:47.013
I see dead people.

00:47.015 --> 00:49.081
They hide in the walls
and they watch.

00:49.083 --> 00:51.684
I speak to dead people.

00:51.686 --> 00:54.320
She's definitely
a serial killer.

00:54.322 --> 00:56.022
And they speak to me.

00:56.024 --> 00:58.558
She's going
to torture them.

00:58.560 --> 01:02.028
But there's only one way
to know if my findings are real.

01:02.030 --> 01:04.129
They were all murdered.

01:04.132 --> 01:05.831
I rely on my partner.

01:05.833 --> 01:07.266
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

01:07.268 --> 01:09.168
I'm a retired New York City
homicide detective.

01:09.170 --> 01:11.837
So, is this the only time
you've been physically attacked?

01:11.839 --> 01:15.741
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:15.743 --> 01:17.376
There's no question
in my mind

01:17.378 --> 01:19.378
that he was talking
about Satan.

01:19.380 --> 01:21.380
It's my job to reveal them.

01:21.382 --> 01:22.915
Who do you think
possessed you?

01:22.917 --> 01:24.750
But Steve and I never speak...

01:24.752 --> 01:26.752
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:26.754 --> 01:28.120
...until the very end...

01:28.122 --> 01:29.722
Well, you're not gonna
want to see this.

01:29.724 --> 01:32.091
...when we uncover
if it's safe for you to stay...

01:32.093 --> 01:33.526
Hell no!

01:33.528 --> 01:35.027
...or time to get out.

01:35.029 --> 01:37.196
Everyone is in jeopardy.

01:39.000 --> 01:45.074

01:52.580 --> 01:54.213
I'm back in Waxahachie, Texas.

01:54.215 --> 01:56.849
It's a small town about
a half-hour south of Dallas.

01:56.851 --> 01:58.651
I got a call
from a woman named Kim.

01:58.653 --> 02:01.120
She sounds real broken up,

02:01.122 --> 02:03.723
says whatever's in the house
killed her husband.

02:03.725 --> 02:05.491
Now, her daughter is about
to move back in,

02:05.493 --> 02:08.026
and she's terrified
it's gonna go after her, too.

02:08.029 --> 02:11.397
She's desperate for
help and says we are
her very last hope.

02:14.469 --> 02:15.701
Before Amy arrives,

02:15.703 --> 02:19.405
I clear the area
of any leading information.

02:19.407 --> 02:22.308
This home is filled
with family photographs,

02:22.310 --> 02:24.610
so it's important that I cover
or remove them all.

02:26.280 --> 02:29.448
When I'm done, the location will
be ready for tonight's walk.

02:39.827 --> 02:41.193
Boy.

02:41.195 --> 02:43.362
Somebody doesn't
want me over there.

02:43.364 --> 02:44.930
Literally, I'm feeling like

02:44.932 --> 02:48.801
I'm having to push
through energy to get there.

02:48.803 --> 02:51.570
I'm feeling like
I'm being pushed away.

02:53.875 --> 02:56.342
This is not a good situation.

02:56.344 --> 02:59.412
I'm getting violence, violence.

03:04.786 --> 03:06.419
Well, Kim,
I got to tell you,

03:06.421 --> 03:08.587
this is an absolutely
beautiful home.

03:08.589 --> 03:10.322
It sounds like
you're going through
a tough time here.

03:10.324 --> 03:12.058
Why were you so desperate
for us to come?

03:12.060 --> 03:13.559
As crazy as it sounds,

03:13.561 --> 03:15.594
I feel like this house
killed my husband.

03:17.532 --> 03:18.798
What did he pass from?

03:18.800 --> 03:20.533
He died of
a malignant brain tumor

03:20.535 --> 03:22.368
that was inoperable.

03:22.370 --> 03:24.270
He eventually
became bedridden,

03:24.272 --> 03:25.905
and he passed away
in the house.

03:25.907 --> 03:27.206
And how old was he
when he passed?

03:27.208 --> 03:28.808
45 years old.

03:28.810 --> 03:31.610
Why do you think the
house had anything to
do with his tumor?

03:31.612 --> 03:33.279
He was
a perfectly healthy man,

03:33.281 --> 03:34.447
strong as an ox.

03:34.449 --> 03:37.049
And then you just...

03:37.051 --> 03:38.484
you die.

03:38.486 --> 03:40.519
It's not fair.

03:40.521 --> 03:41.654
No, it's not.

03:41.656 --> 03:43.956
This is a picture
of my husband, Angel.

03:46.961 --> 03:48.928
Had he been
diagnosed already?

03:48.930 --> 03:51.731
No, that was within the year
before he was diagnosed.

03:51.733 --> 03:53.299
Okay.

03:53.301 --> 03:55.835
When did you guys
start having experiences?

03:55.837 --> 03:59.238
From the very first moment
we stepped foot in the house.

03:59.240 --> 04:01.540
While your husband
was alive, did you
guys do anything

04:01.542 --> 04:04.844
to try to figure out
what was going on here?

04:04.846 --> 04:07.246
We actually had a team come
and do a blessing.

04:07.248 --> 04:08.914
When you say "a team,"
what do you mean?

04:08.916 --> 04:10.683
Like a paranormal...
A paranormal team.

04:10.685 --> 04:12.551
Okay,
so how did that go?

04:12.553 --> 04:14.487
The atmosphere
felt lighter,

04:14.489 --> 04:15.988
but it didn't last long.

04:15.990 --> 04:18.089
Now, Kim, do you know
any history about the house?

04:18.091 --> 04:20.493
I know that it was built
in 1915,

04:20.495 --> 04:22.495
and that one of
the original owners,

04:22.497 --> 04:24.063
T.W. Burleson...
Okay.

04:24.065 --> 04:27.466
...was actually struck
by an automobile
across the street,

04:27.468 --> 04:29.368
and he was killed.

04:29.370 --> 04:32.371
Why did you want
this house so bad?

04:32.373 --> 04:34.707
I saw the house
and fell in love with it.

04:34.709 --> 04:36.709
Angel said that my dream
would be his

04:36.711 --> 04:38.344
and he would learn
to love it.

04:38.346 --> 04:41.280
But it wasn't something
that he was crazy about.

04:41.282 --> 04:42.982
And he says,
"If it's your dream,

04:42.984 --> 04:45.151
it will become mine."

04:45.153 --> 04:48.587
I feel like I'm responsible
for his death

04:48.589 --> 04:50.689
because if I hadn't
have been insistent

04:50.691 --> 04:52.424
about moving
into this house,

04:52.426 --> 04:54.894
maybe he would
still be alive.

04:54.896 --> 04:56.729
He was the love
of my life.

04:56.731 --> 04:58.798
I don't want you
to feel guilty.

04:58.800 --> 05:00.199
Here, hang on.

05:00.201 --> 05:01.300
Take this.

05:04.672 --> 05:06.572
I do.

05:10.244 --> 05:12.645
If it was just his time,
because things happen,

05:12.647 --> 05:14.513
I can totally accept that.

05:14.515 --> 05:17.216
But if there was something
attached to him,

05:17.218 --> 05:18.818
in this house...
Yeah.

05:18.820 --> 05:20.419
...that hurt him...

05:21.923 --> 05:24.723
...I can't help
but blame myself.

05:24.725 --> 05:26.692
And now you have your daughter
moving back in, right?

05:26.694 --> 05:29.829
I can't risk
her coming back home

05:29.831 --> 05:31.197
and something
happening to her.

05:31.199 --> 05:34.099
I'd never forgive myself,
because I don't --

05:34.101 --> 05:35.568
I blame myself for him.

05:35.570 --> 05:38.304
I can't have anything
happen to my daughter.

05:38.306 --> 05:39.672
Okay.

05:39.674 --> 05:42.074
I need whatever it is,
if there's something here,

05:42.076 --> 05:44.610
to be gone.

05:48.716 --> 05:53.986
I think a living woman here
is suffering from depression.

05:53.988 --> 05:57.156
I got a great loss.

05:57.158 --> 05:59.692
Something happened
to somebody that they know,

05:59.694 --> 06:02.962
and now this female
feels suicidal.

06:07.034 --> 06:10.336
Somebody died in this area.

06:10.338 --> 06:12.204
I'm not exactly sure where.

06:12.206 --> 06:14.073
I'm hearing,
"Man, this is wrong.

06:14.075 --> 06:16.008
This is so wrong.
No way, no way.

06:16.010 --> 06:18.544
This is wrong."

06:20.781 --> 06:22.781
Like, this can't be
happening, no way.

06:28.656 --> 06:29.889
You spend a lot of time
up here?

06:29.891 --> 06:32.424
Yes.
It was Angel's room.

06:32.426 --> 06:34.526
Occasionally,
I come up here
to remember him

06:34.528 --> 06:35.794
and feel close to him.

06:35.796 --> 06:37.730
In fact,
those are his ashes.

06:37.732 --> 06:39.531
- Right there?
- Yes.

06:39.533 --> 06:41.166
Okay, so what's
going on up here?

06:41.168 --> 06:42.935
We've heard
disembodied voices.

06:42.937 --> 06:43.903
Okay, what kind?

06:43.905 --> 06:45.204
The sound
of a little girl,

06:45.206 --> 06:46.772
and we've heard
a woman screaming.

06:46.774 --> 06:48.874
Now, the scream --
what did it sound like?

06:48.876 --> 06:51.310
It sounded like
a woman was being hurt.

06:51.312 --> 06:53.779
We even called the police
and had them come out.

06:53.781 --> 06:55.314
They showed up,
searched the grounds,

06:55.316 --> 06:58.284
and found no evidence
of a woman.

06:58.286 --> 06:59.385
Anything else?

06:59.387 --> 07:02.187
Yes, I've been pushed
down the stairs.

07:02.189 --> 07:04.023
Okay,
tell me what happened.

07:04.025 --> 07:05.891
I was actually walking
down the stairs

07:05.893 --> 07:08.994
and felt two hands
on my back and shoved me,

07:08.996 --> 07:10.863
and I went tumbling down
to the end.

07:10.865 --> 07:12.131
How bad
did you get hurt?

07:12.133 --> 07:13.299
I was bruised
and battered,

07:13.301 --> 07:14.967
but not seriously hurt.

07:14.969 --> 07:17.836
I mean, you're very lucky.
You could've broke your neck.

07:20.641 --> 07:23.242
I saw a crazy old man,

07:23.244 --> 07:26.211
like late 60s, early 70s.

07:26.213 --> 07:27.513
He acts like an animal

07:27.515 --> 07:29.014
with him crawling
on the ceiling,

07:29.016 --> 07:31.016
crawling on the walls.

07:31.018 --> 07:33.519
Well, he jumped down,
and he was, like, kind of like

07:33.521 --> 07:35.587
doing an all-fours
kind of thing.

07:35.589 --> 07:38.223
And he then went back up
on the ceiling,

07:38.225 --> 07:41.026
and then he was
grabbing my hair.

07:41.028 --> 07:43.562
So, I felt like that's something

07:43.564 --> 07:45.898
the living here
might experience,

07:45.900 --> 07:49.335
is having their hair
pulled or tugged.

07:54.775 --> 07:56.475
I'm hearing children up here.

07:58.012 --> 08:00.946
Little, little kids.

08:00.948 --> 08:03.716
Somebody's screaming.

08:03.718 --> 08:06.418
Piercing scream, female.

08:14.695 --> 08:16.428
Okay, is this where
Angel passed?

08:16.430 --> 08:17.863
Yes.

08:17.865 --> 08:19.331
Do you
still sleep here?

08:19.333 --> 08:20.466
Yes.

08:20.468 --> 08:22.401
What about experiences
that you've had?

08:22.403 --> 08:25.104
Several times,
I've actually seen
a shadow figure.

08:25.106 --> 08:26.305
Describe it for me.

08:26.307 --> 08:29.341
It's a tall, slim
shadow figure.

08:29.343 --> 08:31.443
So, how are you so sure
it's not an actual person?

08:31.445 --> 08:33.846
Because when it's a person,
there are distinct features,

08:33.847 --> 08:35.847
and this was just
total blackness.

08:37.385 --> 08:38.717
Anything else?

08:38.719 --> 08:41.053
I was actually scratched
on my hand.

08:41.054 --> 08:43.355
We were actually
having a discussion,

08:43.357 --> 08:46.025
and I looked down,
and there were three
scratches on my hand.

08:46.027 --> 08:48.360
And it actually felt
like my hand was on fire.

08:48.362 --> 08:49.928
Okay, now,
what about Angel?

08:49.930 --> 08:51.330
Did he have experiences
in here?

08:51.332 --> 08:52.898
Yes, oftentimes
he would wake up

08:52.900 --> 08:54.767
with bruises
and bite marks.

08:54.769 --> 08:57.136
Here's a photo.

08:57.138 --> 08:58.604
Geez.

08:58.606 --> 09:01.106
Now, could this bruising
have come from the
medication he was on?

09:01.108 --> 09:04.843
No, because that happened
well before he was diagnosed.

09:04.845 --> 09:06.645
All right, did anything else
happen with Angel?

09:06.647 --> 09:10.149
Yes, one night I awakened
to him standing over me,

09:10.151 --> 09:12.918
and he looked or appeared
as if he was possessed.

09:12.920 --> 09:14.553
Okay, so what
makes you say that?

09:14.555 --> 09:15.821
It wasn't my husband.

09:15.823 --> 09:17.856
One of the things
I called him was <i> "Papi"...</i>

09:17.858 --> 09:19.024
Okay.
...and he loved that.

09:19.026 --> 09:21.627
This person looked at me
and said, essentially,

09:21.629 --> 09:23.195
"If you call me
<i> 'Papi'</i> one more time,

09:23.197 --> 09:24.963
I'll smack
the hell out of you."

09:24.965 --> 09:27.533
The next morning,
he remembered
absolutely nothing.

09:27.535 --> 09:29.368
Yeah, but was he drinking
that night?

09:29.370 --> 09:30.402
No.

09:30.404 --> 09:32.104
Did he take any drugs
or anything?

09:32.106 --> 09:33.372
No.

09:33.374 --> 09:34.973
Do you think
he's here?

09:34.975 --> 09:36.175
I do.

09:36.177 --> 09:37.409
You do.

09:39.947 --> 09:42.548
I'm sorry.

09:42.550 --> 09:45.284
I'm sorry.
I know. I know.

09:47.988 --> 09:50.055
This room has issues.

09:50.057 --> 09:52.124
There are a lot of dead
in here,

09:52.126 --> 09:54.393
and they're walking
through that mirror.

09:54.395 --> 09:56.995
I think some go in the mirror,
and I think some go out.

09:58.632 --> 10:00.599
So would the living
in this room

10:00.601 --> 10:03.235
be in any kind of danger
from all this traffic?

10:03.237 --> 10:06.371
Yes. This place
is extremely active.

10:10.244 --> 10:13.312
I feel really bad.

10:34.934 --> 10:36.167
You haven't lived here
in a while,

10:36.169 --> 10:38.302
but when you were here,
did you have experiences?

10:38.304 --> 10:39.237
Yes, I did.

10:39.239 --> 10:40.838
Okay, let's talk
about them.

10:40.840 --> 10:43.374
One night,
while I was in bed,

10:43.376 --> 10:46.344
I felt something bad.

10:46.346 --> 10:47.612
In what way?

10:47.614 --> 10:49.981
Whatever it was,
it wasn't friendly,

10:49.983 --> 10:53.251
and I felt that
it wanted to hurt me.

10:53.253 --> 10:54.252
It was terrifying.

10:54.254 --> 10:55.753
You sure you weren't
dreaming this?

10:55.755 --> 10:56.888
Yes.

10:56.890 --> 10:59.190
It was one of
the worst experiences

10:59.192 --> 11:00.725
I've ever had
in this house.

11:00.727 --> 11:03.494
So, you said it was
<i> one</i> of the worst experiences.

11:03.496 --> 11:05.029
What was the worst?

11:05.031 --> 11:07.265
I was standing
in front of the toilet,

11:07.267 --> 11:10.668
and something pushed me
over the counter.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.370
When you got pushed,
did it feel like

11:12.372 --> 11:14.338
a human being
was pushing you?

11:14.340 --> 11:18.176
No, it felt like
something went through me.

11:18.178 --> 11:19.443
Did you get hurt
at all?

11:19.445 --> 11:21.712
No, I managed
to catch myself.

11:21.714 --> 11:23.014
You're lucky because

11:23.016 --> 11:24.882
that could have been
really serious.

11:28.221 --> 11:29.921
<i> Something</i> happened here, man.

11:31.524 --> 11:34.225
I'm seeing a male
with a shotgun on his hip.

11:34.227 --> 11:37.495
He's kind of dressed
like a farmer.

11:37.497 --> 11:41.032
He's in here with this thing.

11:41.034 --> 11:43.701
It's a black mass.

11:43.703 --> 11:46.537
This black mass and this farmer
have the capability

11:46.539 --> 11:49.473
of interacting
with its surroundings.

11:49.475 --> 11:53.878
That could mean that it could
harm the living, physically.

11:56.616 --> 11:58.649
Do you know
what they want?

12:00.653 --> 12:04.722
I'm hearing the farmer say,
"I want my house back."

12:12.599 --> 12:14.865
So, Vernon, I understand
you're Kim's brother?

12:14.867 --> 12:16.000
Yes, sir.

12:16.002 --> 12:17.468
What's it like
when you come here?

12:17.470 --> 12:20.705
I'm scared. I won't even go
to the restroom by myself.

12:20.707 --> 12:23.207
Me and my wife
go together.

12:23.209 --> 12:26.577
So, I'm assuming
you've had experiences, then?

12:26.579 --> 12:28.779
Yeah, with the swing
on the front porch.

12:28.781 --> 12:31.382
I come outside,
it was just swinging.

12:31.384 --> 12:33.184
The trees won't
be swaying or nothing.

12:33.186 --> 12:35.720
It be swinging like
somebody's sitting in it.

12:35.722 --> 12:40.157
And you didn't see no
kids going by, maybe
jerking around with it?
None of that.

12:40.159 --> 12:41.659
Okay, anything else?

12:41.661 --> 12:45.396
Yeah, I saw a man,
a dog, and a tree

12:45.398 --> 12:46.597
just disappear.

12:48.701 --> 12:51.469
Okay,
that's a new one on me.

12:51.471 --> 12:52.536
Tell me what happened.

12:52.538 --> 12:54.772
About 2:00
in the morning,

12:54.774 --> 12:56.474
and I looked
out the window,

12:56.476 --> 12:57.875
and I saw it.

12:57.877 --> 13:01.579
I looked again,
and it was gone,
just like that.

13:01.581 --> 13:04.815
That's pretty interesting stuff
you've experienced here.
Yeah.

13:04.817 --> 13:06.183
So, are you worried
about your sister

13:06.185 --> 13:07.752
being in this house
all alone?

13:07.754 --> 13:09.387
I mean, this house is huge.

13:09.389 --> 13:10.421
Yes, sir.

13:10.423 --> 13:11.856
Would you stay
in this house alone,

13:11.858 --> 13:13.658
or you and your wife together
stay here alone?

13:14.927 --> 13:16.260
I ain't gonna
be able to do it.

13:16.262 --> 13:17.628
Okay.

13:17.630 --> 13:19.497
For real, I ain't gonna
be able to do it.

13:23.069 --> 13:27.271
There's <i> a lot</i>
of residual energy here.

13:28.341 --> 13:30.675
It's kind of overwhelming.

13:34.480 --> 13:37.214
How would the living
be affected by all this?

13:37.216 --> 13:39.684
I think that they would
see things on occasion.

13:39.686 --> 13:42.453
I think they would hear
<i> a lot</i> of things.

13:44.123 --> 13:46.390
It's making me sick.

13:52.799 --> 13:54.865
Okay, so, Tony, Sarah,
I understand that you guys

13:54.867 --> 13:56.233
are part of
the paranormal team

13:56.235 --> 13:57.802
that came in
to investigate the house.

13:57.804 --> 13:58.836
Kim called you guys,
right?

13:58.838 --> 14:00.671
- We are.
- That's right.

14:00.673 --> 14:03.774
All right, so, Tony,
you used this equipment
on your investigation?
Yes.

14:03.776 --> 14:05.943
Okay, now tell me
about what you got in there.

14:05.945 --> 14:08.479
This right here
would be a digital recorder,

14:08.481 --> 14:10.214
which would record EVPs,

14:10.216 --> 14:12.583
or, you know,
electronic voice phenomena.

14:12.585 --> 14:13.851
Okay.

14:13.853 --> 14:15.486
This would be
a Mel Meter,

14:15.488 --> 14:18.556
and this right here
actually detects
ambient temperature,

14:18.558 --> 14:21.192
as well as
electromagnetic fields.

14:23.663 --> 14:25.496
A ghost box
is a tool used.

14:25.498 --> 14:28.766
It gives spirits
a way to communicate --

14:28.768 --> 14:30.301
a white noise,
if you will.

14:30.303 --> 14:31.769
After your investigation,

14:31.771 --> 14:33.437
in your
professional opinion,

14:33.439 --> 14:35.072
what did you find
that was here?

14:35.074 --> 14:37.174
You felt like something
was watching you all the time,

14:37.176 --> 14:39.110
like the air
might bite you.

14:39.112 --> 14:40.711
Kim believes that
whatever's in this house

14:40.713 --> 14:43.247
is what made Angel sick
and eventually pass away.

14:43.249 --> 14:44.548
Do you agree with that?

14:44.550 --> 14:46.317
- I do.
- Yes.

14:46.319 --> 14:49.253
We're pretty certain that
that's what happened to Angel.

14:54.360 --> 14:59.196
At some point, spiritualism
was practiced here.

15:01.067 --> 15:04.268
Like 1901 to 1920s?

15:06.706 --> 15:09.407
Possibly, these people
did something bad,

15:09.409 --> 15:11.008
accidentally,
you know?

15:12.979 --> 15:17.782
I'm seeing paranormal
investigators doing EVPs, maybe?

15:17.784 --> 15:20.451
And he's taking pictures
and video.

15:20.453 --> 15:23.187
The female is saying,
"Don't go into the darkness."

15:26.426 --> 15:30.161
I'm seeing
a paranormal investigator here,

15:30.163 --> 15:31.562
and then, downstairs,

15:31.564 --> 15:35.866
seeing these spiritualists
practiced here.

15:35.868 --> 15:37.735
To me, that's scary

15:37.737 --> 15:40.471
because you don't know
what they're doing,

15:40.473 --> 15:42.640
so they could be
agitating dead people.

15:42.642 --> 15:44.241
And if you agitate them,

15:44.243 --> 15:46.877
they could be hurting
living people.

16:00.293 --> 16:02.026
Kim said a previous
homeowner died

16:02.028 --> 16:04.161
after getting hit by a car
in front of the house,

16:04.163 --> 16:07.164
so I called my old friend,
historian Sylvia Smith,

16:07.166 --> 16:09.300
and she says it's true.

16:09.302 --> 16:11.635
But she says this guy
also led a colorful life

16:11.637 --> 16:13.437
I'm definitely going
to want to know about.

16:20.012 --> 16:22.046
Well, Sylvia,
it's good to see you again.

16:22.048 --> 16:23.981
Before we get to the accident,
you said on the phone

16:23.983 --> 16:25.649
that this guy had
an interesting life.

16:25.651 --> 16:27.084
What can you
tell me about him?

16:27.086 --> 16:29.420
The gentleman
you're speaking of
is T.W. Burleson.

16:29.422 --> 16:32.857
He was a farmer,
and he came here in 1902

16:32.859 --> 16:35.426
and bought this property
that you're investigating.

16:35.428 --> 16:36.861
Was he married
at this point?

16:36.863 --> 16:37.928
Yes, he was.

16:37.930 --> 16:40.498
He was married to a lady
named May Ward.

16:40.500 --> 16:44.468
Soon after they came,
he turned his property
into a honey business.

16:44.470 --> 16:45.636
Okay.

16:45.638 --> 16:48.272
And I have this photo here
of the backyard

16:48.274 --> 16:50.474
just filled
with bee hives.

16:50.476 --> 16:53.477
So, now, did they
live on the property
with the bees?

16:53.479 --> 16:56.614
I'm not sure where
they lived up until 1915,

16:56.616 --> 16:59.316
when they built the house
that's on the property today.

16:59.318 --> 17:00.618
So, business
had to be good

17:00.620 --> 17:02.086
because that house
is big.

17:02.088 --> 17:04.722
They did very well
until 1925,

17:04.723 --> 17:08.358
when the factory
that was on the
property burned.

17:08.361 --> 17:10.060
Okay, so how much damage
we talking about?

17:10.061 --> 17:13.130
Well, they had
$30,000 worth of damage.

17:13.132 --> 17:14.832
And, in today's market,

17:14.834 --> 17:17.067
it would probably be
$400,000.

17:17.069 --> 17:19.637
They shut down for
like three months
while they rebuilt.

17:19.638 --> 17:20.804
Okay.

17:22.474 --> 17:26.977
I'm seeing the farmer guy again,
and I think he owned this land.

17:29.782 --> 17:32.316
But I hear a,
"Don't go in the barn,"

17:32.318 --> 17:34.451
and I'm getting a fire.

17:36.622 --> 17:38.756
I feel like
there's a couple of structures

17:38.758 --> 17:41.692
that aren't here anymore
that belonged to him,

17:41.694 --> 17:43.827
and he's, like,
just pacing over here.

17:43.829 --> 17:47.531
I'm getting panicked and,
like, completely freaked out.

17:50.736 --> 17:51.735
He's in a rage.

17:51.737 --> 17:55.806
Somebody pissed him off...
bad.

17:55.808 --> 17:57.374
Do you have
any idea why?

17:57.376 --> 18:00.377
Bad dealings, business,

18:00.379 --> 18:03.514
money lost.

18:03.516 --> 18:05.583
He's got nothing else to lose.

18:09.021 --> 18:11.021
Okay, so let's
get to the accident.

18:11.023 --> 18:12.489
I know Burleson
was hit by a car

18:12.491 --> 18:13.958
in front of
my client's property.

18:13.960 --> 18:16.827
Yes, the accident
was in 1944,

18:16.829 --> 18:18.195
and he was
severely injured.

18:18.197 --> 18:21.165
In fact, he remained
in the hospital for two weeks

18:21.167 --> 18:22.666
before he passed away.

18:22.668 --> 18:24.101
He had a fractured skull,

18:24.103 --> 18:26.303
and he died
from swelling of the brain.

18:26.305 --> 18:27.638
Here's
his death certificate,

18:27.640 --> 18:30.240
right here,
that states that.

18:30.242 --> 18:32.743
He was only 67 years old
when he passed away.

18:32.745 --> 18:34.545
So he was
a young man still.

18:34.547 --> 18:35.746
Well, I know
what you meant now

18:35.748 --> 18:37.514
when you said that
he had an interesting life.

18:37.516 --> 18:40.618
I mean, he started out with
nothing, worked his way...

18:40.620 --> 18:42.553
All the way to the top,
you might say.

18:42.555 --> 18:45.155
Right, and then
he tragically gets
hit by a car...

18:45.157 --> 18:46.590
That's true.
...and dies.

18:48.961 --> 18:52.062
I think something bad happened
to this farmer guy.

18:52.064 --> 18:54.264
I hear 1940s,

18:54.266 --> 18:56.400
and I feel my neck break.

18:58.070 --> 18:59.803
He's trying to make me sick.

18:59.805 --> 19:03.007
Because his energy is so bad,

19:03.009 --> 19:05.409
I don't think
the living would enjoy

19:05.411 --> 19:08.112
a large portion,
even, of the land.

19:09.448 --> 19:11.081
Their heart
would start hurting.

19:11.083 --> 19:15.252
They would feel
extremely nauseous, shaky,

19:15.254 --> 19:17.888
nervous, scared.

19:17.890 --> 19:20.057
I just, like,
totally want to cry here.

19:23.763 --> 19:25.496
So far, I've got
a grieving widow

19:25.498 --> 19:27.264
who believes her house
killed her husband

19:27.266 --> 19:29.333
on a property
where a previous owner died

19:29.335 --> 19:31.502
in a tragic car accident.

19:31.504 --> 19:34.004
But I want to see
if there's anything else.

19:34.006 --> 19:35.172
Searching through old records,

19:35.174 --> 19:37.541
I come across a teenager
named Kenneth Doty

19:37.543 --> 19:39.576
who worked
in the bee factory.

19:39.578 --> 19:42.479
Turns out he hung himself
in 1968,

19:42.481 --> 19:44.081
right on Kim's property.

19:47.053 --> 19:48.886
So I called a bunch
of Kimberly's neighbors.

19:48.888 --> 19:51.789
Most of them didn't know
anything about the hanging.

19:51.791 --> 19:53.123
But then I found one old guy,

19:53.125 --> 19:55.693
and it turns out he worked
side by side with Kenny.

19:55.695 --> 19:58.062
Not only that,
he remembers the day he died.

20:07.273 --> 20:08.772
Now, I understand
this kid Doty

20:08.774 --> 20:10.474
actually worked
on the property.

20:10.476 --> 20:11.575
Is that correct?
Yes.

20:11.577 --> 20:12.843
Did you get
to know him at all?

20:12.845 --> 20:14.745
Yeah, just through
working with him.

20:14.747 --> 20:15.679
What was he like?

20:15.681 --> 20:16.680
Well,
he was a good kid.

20:16.682 --> 20:17.848
You know,
he was a hard worker.

20:17.850 --> 20:20.417
He played football,
number 63.

20:22.121 --> 20:23.854
He didn't talk
a whole lot.

20:23.856 --> 20:25.456
You asked him
to do something, he did it,

20:25.458 --> 20:26.890
and he did a good job.

20:26.892 --> 20:28.392
And he was
how old at the time?

20:28.394 --> 20:29.927
I think 18.

20:29.929 --> 20:32.730
Now, Sonny, I know
this happened on
October 19th in 1968.

20:32.732 --> 20:33.997
What happened that day?

20:33.999 --> 20:36.133
I guess he just
got depressed

20:36.135 --> 20:37.201
and hung himself.

20:37.203 --> 20:38.335
Now, where
did he do that?

20:38.337 --> 20:40.738
Right here.

20:40.740 --> 20:42.372
He took
a piece of strapping,

20:42.374 --> 20:43.407
similar to this stuff.

20:43.409 --> 20:45.709
Let me see that.
Okay.

20:45.711 --> 20:47.611
So it looks like,
almost like a rope.

20:47.613 --> 20:49.913
He ties it
on the ladder,

20:49.915 --> 20:51.782
climbs up the ladder,

20:51.784 --> 20:53.484
puts it
around his neck,

20:53.486 --> 20:55.219
and jumps
over that rafter.

20:56.822 --> 20:59.156
And he was hanging
about where I'm standing.

20:59.158 --> 21:00.624
Now, who found him?

21:00.626 --> 21:01.592
My wife.

21:01.594 --> 21:03.727
- Your wife did?
- Yes.

21:03.729 --> 21:06.130
I come in
later that evening

21:06.132 --> 21:08.132
and find out about it.

21:08.134 --> 21:09.233
There wasn't anything left

21:09.235 --> 21:11.869
but that piece of rope
tied to the ladder.

21:11.871 --> 21:13.270
So, now,
were they pretty sure

21:13.272 --> 21:15.239
it was officially
a suicide?

21:15.241 --> 21:17.074
That's what his
death certificate says...

21:17.076 --> 21:18.609
Let me see.

21:18.611 --> 21:22.146
...and I don't have
any reason to believe it
would be anything else.

21:22.148 --> 21:23.914
Any indication why the hell
he might have did this?

21:23.916 --> 21:26.049
He had broken up
with his girlfriend,

21:26.051 --> 21:27.651
and he was depressed.

21:27.653 --> 21:29.253
18 years old, he
had his whole life
in front of him,

21:29.255 --> 21:31.588
and, you know, he threw it
all away for a girl.

21:31.590 --> 21:33.090
Yeah.

21:35.461 --> 21:38.896
I just got a young male,

21:38.898 --> 21:41.431
not that long ago --
'40s, '50s --

21:41.433 --> 21:44.668
I would say between
the age of 15 and 20.

21:44.670 --> 21:47.304
I was in his body,

21:47.306 --> 21:49.673
and I could feel
a rope around my neck.

21:51.677 --> 21:54.311
Somebody had the other side
of the rope,

21:54.313 --> 21:57.047
so it's looped over something,

21:57.049 --> 21:59.650
and they're tugging
on that rope,

21:59.652 --> 22:02.419
so I kept going up and down
by my neck.

22:05.591 --> 22:07.724
I don't know specifically
how many people there were,

22:07.726 --> 22:09.359
but I heard them laughing,

22:09.361 --> 22:13.130
so I know a man
was doing the tugging on me.

22:13.132 --> 22:15.065
Eventually,
it did break the neck.

22:15.067 --> 22:17.801
He's reliving,
over and over again,

22:17.803 --> 22:19.303
what happened to him.

22:19.305 --> 22:21.405
It's really bad!

22:46.674 --> 22:48.608
Another thing got my attention
in research --

22:48.610 --> 22:51.010
during the Civil War,
there was a deadly explosion

22:51.012 --> 22:53.112
at a gunpowder mill
right near Kim's house.

22:54.349 --> 22:56.315
I'm heading over
to meet a local professor

22:56.317 --> 22:59.552
who says it was a massive blast
that rocked the entire area.

23:05.860 --> 23:07.293
Robin, I appreciate
you meeting with me.

23:07.295 --> 23:08.361
Thank you.

23:08.363 --> 23:09.929
Okay, this explosion
that happened,

23:09.931 --> 23:11.998
before we even get to that,
I'm curious --

23:12.000 --> 23:14.700
what was Waxahachie like
during the Civil War?

23:14.702 --> 23:18.438
Waxahachie and pretty
much all of the small
towns in Texas --

23:18.440 --> 23:19.872
there were
a number of people

23:19.874 --> 23:21.674
who were opposed
to secession

23:21.676 --> 23:24.343
and a number of people who
wanted secession to happen,

23:24.345 --> 23:26.145
and Waxahachie
was the same way.

23:26.147 --> 23:28.014
So there was
a lot of tension.

23:28.016 --> 23:29.315
This was a period of time

23:29.317 --> 23:31.484
that was called
the "Texas Troubles."

23:31.486 --> 23:33.553
Okay, so what happened
with the explosion?

23:33.555 --> 23:36.389
On April 29th, 1863,

23:36.391 --> 23:39.826
a gunpowder mill exploded
less than a mile away

23:39.828 --> 23:41.894
from the property
you're investigating.

23:41.896 --> 23:43.329
It's less than a mile
from my client's property.

23:43.331 --> 23:46.065
I got to assume they must
have heard it and felt it.

23:46.067 --> 23:47.066
Most definitely.

23:47.068 --> 23:49.101
I would describe it
as "seismic,"

23:49.103 --> 23:52.271
meaning that it probably
shook the walls and so forth.

23:52.273 --> 23:55.208
Now, how much gunpowder
do we think exploded?

23:55.210 --> 23:58.878
There was about 800 pounds
that exploded.

23:58.880 --> 24:01.447
Wow. Okay,
so what about casualties?

24:01.449 --> 24:04.917
There were two
men who perished
in the explosion.

24:04.919 --> 24:06.452
Okay, so now
we have two dead?

24:06.454 --> 24:07.887
Yes.

24:07.889 --> 24:10.122
So, was there an
investigation or
any arrests done?

24:10.124 --> 24:11.958
There were no arrests
then, no.

24:11.960 --> 24:14.327
Okay. All right, so
what's the theories
on what happened?

24:14.329 --> 24:15.828
Well, there were
a number of people

24:15.830 --> 24:17.163
that thought
it was sabotage.

24:17.165 --> 24:20.166
David Natz, who survived
the explosion,

24:20.168 --> 24:23.536
he mentioned that
there was a possible
Northern sympathizer

24:23.538 --> 24:26.472
or a stranger that
was lurking around the mill

24:26.474 --> 24:28.074
before the explosion.

24:28.076 --> 24:29.442
But they never
found this guy?

24:29.444 --> 24:31.477
No. No, they never
found this guy.

24:31.479 --> 24:32.945
He magically disappeared.

24:32.947 --> 24:34.747
So, Robin, what do
you think happened?

24:34.749 --> 24:37.483
David Natz,
he was in charge of the mill

24:37.485 --> 24:39.018
at the explosion,
at the time,

24:39.020 --> 24:40.753
and he was just
a 20-year-old kid --

24:40.755 --> 24:43.189
inexperienced
and kind of green.

24:43.191 --> 24:45.191
It was most likely
an accident,

24:45.193 --> 24:46.826
is what I believe.
Right.

24:46.828 --> 24:48.461
Well,
it's a tragic story,

24:48.463 --> 24:51.664
but pretty lucky that
only two people died
in this explosion.

24:51.666 --> 24:53.065
I agree.

24:58.206 --> 25:01.974
I'm getting
a sharp pain here.

25:01.976 --> 25:03.242
This is a male.

25:05.246 --> 25:07.046
I'm hearing military.

25:07.048 --> 25:09.882
He's white, crew cut.

25:09.884 --> 25:11.784
I think he's in his 20s.

25:13.087 --> 25:16.889
I'm seeing people drinking,
having a good time,

25:16.891 --> 25:19.325
and then I see
the room turns like

25:19.327 --> 25:22.461
this weird,
pinkish-orange color,

25:22.463 --> 25:26.966
and I hear people
yelling and screaming.

25:26.968 --> 25:32.672
There's maybe, in this room,
four or five people,

25:32.674 --> 25:35.775
and literally
everything goes dark,

25:35.777 --> 25:38.844
and all you see
is this weird color.

25:38.846 --> 25:40.379
I heard the word "fire."

25:40.381 --> 25:41.514
Any idea
when this was?

25:41.516 --> 25:42.582
It's old.

25:42.584 --> 25:45.117
They're showing me
bodies laid out.

25:46.521 --> 25:50.189
I'm hearing someone say,
"It came to a bad end."

26:00.969 --> 26:04.670
During my walk,
I saw several disturbing things,

26:04.672 --> 26:08.307
but the angry farmer
concerned me the most.

26:08.309 --> 26:12.178
I'd probably put him
in his late 60s.

26:12.180 --> 26:15.548
He was wearing a hat,

26:15.550 --> 26:19.418
and he had massive,
like, dark circles

26:19.420 --> 26:22.221
and <i> deep</i> sun lines.

26:29.464 --> 26:31.330
Amy,
is this who you saw?

26:32.700 --> 26:34.567
Yes,
that's who I saw.

26:54.155 --> 26:57.056
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

26:57.058 --> 26:59.158
we're ready to reveal
our findings to each other

26:59.160 --> 27:01.460
and our client
for the first time.

27:01.462 --> 27:03.229
Now, Amy, when I sat down
the other day

27:03.231 --> 27:04.630
to talk with Kim,

27:04.632 --> 27:06.165
her story
was so heartbreaking

27:06.167 --> 27:08.968
I had a tough time
keeping it together.

27:08.970 --> 27:11.203
For now, I'm gonna hold off
on telling you too much,

27:11.205 --> 27:12.672
but she lives here alone,

27:12.674 --> 27:14.440
and the main reason
she called us in

27:14.442 --> 27:16.242
is because of her daughter,
Gabrielle.

27:17.779 --> 27:19.845
She's supposed to
move back in,

27:19.847 --> 27:21.814
and Kim doesn't think
it's safe.

27:23.484 --> 27:25.918
So now that I told Amy
a little bit about you, Kim,

27:25.920 --> 27:27.720
I'm gonna ask her
to describe her walk.

27:30.692 --> 27:32.725
When I first
got to your house,

27:32.727 --> 27:36.529
I ran into a dead male
between 15 and 20 years old.

27:36.531 --> 27:38.330
I got that he is
a conscious entity,

27:38.332 --> 27:40.633
but, unfortunately,
he's stuck

27:40.635 --> 27:42.568
in the loop
of his death.

27:42.570 --> 27:43.903
I was in his body,

27:43.905 --> 27:45.905
so I'm not sure
what he looked like,

27:45.907 --> 27:48.741
but I could feel that there
was a rope around my neck.

27:48.743 --> 27:51.043
Rope, I know,
was looped over something.

27:51.045 --> 27:52.011
He was hanged.

27:52.013 --> 27:53.245
I believe
it was a murder,

27:53.247 --> 27:54.980
and I believe
it was fairly recent --

27:54.982 --> 27:57.717
as far as
the '40s or the '50s.

27:57.719 --> 27:59.585
That's pretty amazing.

27:59.587 --> 28:01.053
Well, back in the day,
the property used to be

28:01.055 --> 28:03.055
a family-run
honey factory.

28:03.057 --> 28:04.323
It's a family-run business,

28:04.325 --> 28:06.759
but they hired a few
local teenagers to help out.

28:06.761 --> 28:08.527
Now, one of these kids
was an 18-year-old

28:08.529 --> 28:10.229
named Kenny Doty.

28:10.231 --> 28:11.964
He was a quiet,
hardworking kid

28:11.966 --> 28:13.833
who mostly
kept to himself,

28:13.835 --> 28:17.503
but, on October 19th, 1968,
they found his dead body

28:17.505 --> 28:19.305
hanging from a rafter
in the shed.

28:19.307 --> 28:20.706
What?

28:20.708 --> 28:21.974
Now, I talked to
this nice older guy

28:21.976 --> 28:23.809
who ran
the family business.

28:23.811 --> 28:25.377
He told me
he got to know Kenny.

28:25.379 --> 28:28.848
Apparently, he was really upset
about a breakup with a girl.

28:28.850 --> 28:30.216
Now, I got his
death certificate here.

28:30.218 --> 28:32.852
Now, the cops ruled it
a suicide.

28:34.789 --> 28:36.856
I got a photo. You didn't see
the kid, though, right?

28:36.858 --> 28:38.190
No, I was in his body.

28:39.560 --> 28:41.560
Okay,
this is the kid here.

28:43.097 --> 28:46.265
My daughter has
seen a teenage boy
on the property

28:46.267 --> 28:47.700
with dark hair.

28:47.702 --> 28:49.769
Is it possible
she's seen this kid
on the property?

28:49.771 --> 28:51.637
Yeah,
it's a <i> huge</i> possibility.

28:54.075 --> 28:55.007
What else?

28:55.009 --> 28:56.942
When I was upstairs,

28:56.944 --> 29:00.679
in the bedroom
to the far right...

29:00.681 --> 29:02.248
That sounds like
Gabrielle's room.

29:02.250 --> 29:03.716
Yes.

29:03.718 --> 29:07.653
...now, I encountered
two entities up there
that did concern me.

29:07.655 --> 29:11.190
One was in the form
of a black mass.

29:12.960 --> 29:15.728
Black mass could be
physically violent.

29:15.730 --> 29:17.129
Anybody who would stay
in that room

29:17.131 --> 29:21.333
would potentially have
negative experiences.

29:22.837 --> 29:24.837
This is interesting
'cause when I spoke
to Gabrielle,

29:24.839 --> 29:27.072
she told me
that she was lying in bed

29:27.074 --> 29:28.908
and she felt
that something really bad

29:28.910 --> 29:30.609
was lying
right next to her.

29:30.611 --> 29:31.944
She thought
if she turned around,

29:31.946 --> 29:33.345
she was gonna
get attacked.

29:33.347 --> 29:34.747
The second experience
happened

29:34.749 --> 29:37.116
in the bathroom upstairs
next to her room.

29:37.118 --> 29:39.919
She told me she was pushed,
and she was pushed hard.

29:41.055 --> 29:43.589
Did you know about that?
She didn't tell you?

29:43.591 --> 29:44.423
No.

29:44.425 --> 29:47.159
Here.

29:47.161 --> 29:48.494
I'm sorry, sweetie.
I thought you knew.

29:48.496 --> 29:52.565
No, I didn't know that
she was being attacked.

29:52.567 --> 29:53.933
And I certainly didn't know

29:53.935 --> 29:56.368
about the thing
hovering over her.

29:56.370 --> 29:57.536
Well, that's why
we're here --

29:57.538 --> 30:00.239
to find out what the hell
is going on, right?

30:00.241 --> 30:03.275
Now, you also got attacked
outside Gabrielle's bedroom.

30:03.277 --> 30:04.810
Tell Amy what happened.

30:04.812 --> 30:08.547
I was actually walking
down the stairs,

30:08.549 --> 30:12.618
and I actually felt the presence
of something on my back,

30:12.620 --> 30:16.388
and I actually felt two hands
just shove me.

30:16.390 --> 30:18.257
And I went tumbling
down the stairs.

30:18.259 --> 30:19.825
Wow!

30:19.827 --> 30:22.161
Now, you said there was
another entity you saw.

30:22.163 --> 30:25.998
Yes, and the second entity
is a dead male.

30:26.000 --> 30:27.867
I got that
he was a farmer.

30:27.869 --> 30:29.802
He is probably in his 60s,

30:29.804 --> 30:33.539
and, on his hip,
he has a double-barrel shotgun.

30:33.541 --> 30:36.809
Outside, he was going off
about a fire.

30:36.811 --> 30:41.046
He was angry, stomping around
all over back there.

30:41.048 --> 30:43.249
I felt that this dude
lost his money.

30:43.251 --> 30:46.518
He was saying, "I don't have
anything else left to lose."

30:46.520 --> 30:48.821
And I heard something
about 1940s,

30:48.823 --> 30:51.023
and I got that he was
connected to the property,

30:51.025 --> 30:52.825
that he may have owned it.

30:52.827 --> 30:54.627
I said,
"Well, what do you want?"

30:54.629 --> 30:57.162
And he goes,
"I just want my house back."

30:57.164 --> 30:58.397
I'm pissed.

30:58.399 --> 31:00.432
He wants his home back?

31:00.434 --> 31:02.601
He can't have it.

31:02.603 --> 31:04.803
This reminds me
of one of the previous owners

31:04.805 --> 31:06.839
that I came across
in my research.

31:06.841 --> 31:09.174
Now, his name
was T.W. Burleson,

31:09.176 --> 31:13.312
and he built your house,
this house, in 1915.

31:13.314 --> 31:14.914
Now, he ran
that honey business

31:14.916 --> 31:16.415
that I was talking
about earlier.
Right.

31:16.417 --> 31:18.150
This is pretty interesting.

31:18.152 --> 31:21.887
Here's a picture of all
these damn bee hives
he had in the backyard.

31:21.889 --> 31:23.756
You said something
about fire.

31:23.758 --> 31:25.891
Well, in 1925,
there was a major fire,

31:25.893 --> 31:28.193
and it burned
the factory down.

31:28.195 --> 31:30.663
Now, you said something
about the 1940s.

31:30.665 --> 31:33.832
In 1944,
T.W. was crossing the street

31:33.834 --> 31:37.036
right in front of the house
when he was hit by a car.

31:37.038 --> 31:38.437
They rushed him
to the hospital.

31:38.439 --> 31:41.240
Two weeks later,
he dies from a brain swelling.

31:41.242 --> 31:43.208
You said this guy
was in his 60s.

31:43.210 --> 31:45.911
Burleson was 67
at the time of his death.

31:45.913 --> 31:47.980
Now, I managed to track
down a photo of him,

31:47.982 --> 31:52.451
but this was probably closer to
when, I think, he passed away.

31:52.453 --> 31:54.386
Is it possible
this is who you saw?

31:56.324 --> 31:58.791
I mean, I had a sketch
done of him.

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
You kidding?

32:08.002 --> 32:09.668
Tell me what you think.

32:11.505 --> 32:13.472
They resemble.

32:13.474 --> 32:17.576
You can see the nose,
the cheekbones, the mouth.

32:17.578 --> 32:20.379
I mean, it clearly looks
like the same person to me.

32:20.381 --> 32:22.715
I've seen 1,000, 2,000
sketches done

32:22.717 --> 32:24.316
from witnesses on crimes.

32:24.318 --> 32:26.418
This is pretty damn close.

32:26.420 --> 32:27.720
Yeah.

32:28.856 --> 32:30.155
What else?

32:30.157 --> 32:32.691
I was in
the dining room,

32:32.693 --> 32:37.463
and I saw people
practicing spiritualism.

32:37.465 --> 32:41.500
So I would put this back
between 1901 and 1920.

32:41.502 --> 32:44.703
And then I was upstairs.

32:44.705 --> 32:48.440
I'm sitting there,
and I see a male
coming into the room,

32:48.442 --> 32:53.045
and he has an EMF meter,
and he's taking pictures.

32:53.047 --> 32:56.782
And this seemed to be
pretty dang recent.

32:56.784 --> 32:59.752
Now, I don't know anything
about spiritualists,

32:59.754 --> 33:03.088
but Kim did bring in
a paranormal team

33:03.090 --> 33:04.623
to do an investigation.

33:04.625 --> 33:07.526
Okay.
Now, I spoke with them...

33:07.528 --> 33:09.795
Okay.
...and they did use EMFs.

33:09.797 --> 33:11.897
Obviously,
they took photos.

33:11.899 --> 33:13.332
Okay.

33:13.334 --> 33:16.068
Now, do you think these guys
might have stirred things up?

33:17.438 --> 33:19.872
I don't think so.

33:19.874 --> 33:24.276
But the spiritualists may...

33:24.278 --> 33:27.046
have done something
in the past

33:27.048 --> 33:29.114
that agitated the dead
so much

33:29.116 --> 33:32.084
they may now try
to physically harm people.

33:35.222 --> 33:39.324
The other thing I got
was a <i> massive</i> amount

33:39.326 --> 33:42.761
of depression and loss.

33:42.763 --> 33:45.631
I felt that this was due
to a living person.

33:45.633 --> 33:47.332
This person is female.

33:47.334 --> 33:50.936
Something happened
to a person that they love.

33:50.938 --> 33:54.073
They can't recover
from this grief.

33:54.075 --> 33:58.277
I got that they're not eating,
and that they feel suicidal.

33:59.180 --> 34:01.647
You okay?

34:03.884 --> 34:05.417
Amy, you remember
when I told you

34:05.419 --> 34:06.919
that Kim was breaking
my heart?

34:06.921 --> 34:08.454
That's because
her husband died

34:08.456 --> 34:10.456
a couple years ago
at a very young age.

34:10.458 --> 34:12.891
I actually have a photo of him
right here with Kim.

34:14.360 --> 34:16.295
He was
the love of my life.

34:18.364 --> 34:21.433
And we were
supposed to spend

34:21.435 --> 34:23.435
the rest of our lives
in that house.

34:23.437 --> 34:25.838
It wasn't particularly
one he cared for,

34:25.840 --> 34:28.440
but he said
if it's my dream,

34:28.442 --> 34:30.943
it will become
his dream, too.

34:30.945 --> 34:32.945
She feels guilty.

34:32.947 --> 34:34.679
I feel like something
in the house

34:34.681 --> 34:36.681
could have killed him.

34:36.684 --> 34:38.550
Kim, tell her
what he passed from.

34:38.552 --> 34:43.021
He passed away
of a malignant brain tumor

34:43.023 --> 34:44.857
that was inoperable.

34:44.859 --> 34:47.391
None of us
were prepared for that.

34:47.393 --> 34:50.429
If it was his time,
I can accept that.

34:50.431 --> 34:55.567
But if it was me...
convincing him to
buy that house,

34:55.569 --> 34:59.805
and something in it
that was dark hurt him,

34:59.807 --> 35:03.108
I couldn't
forgive myself.

35:03.110 --> 35:05.410
She's worried about

35:05.412 --> 35:07.679
Gabrielle coming back
to live at the house,

35:07.681 --> 35:10.182
and maybe something in the house
could do something to her.

35:10.184 --> 35:12.050
I don't want anything
to happen to my daughter,

35:12.052 --> 35:15.554
and I certainly don't
want her to move back
home if something --

35:15.556 --> 35:19.625
I didn't even know about
the dark mass over her bed.

35:19.627 --> 35:23.061
She never told me that.

35:23.063 --> 35:25.831
I'm tired.
Yeah.

35:25.833 --> 35:27.332
I know you are.

35:29.303 --> 35:31.303
So what else
was going on?

35:31.305 --> 35:33.572
At the foot of the stairs,

35:33.574 --> 35:36.275
what I felt was a male
in his death state.

35:36.277 --> 35:38.877
It was not a good death.
It took a while.

35:38.879 --> 35:41.480
I felt
overwhelming sadness.

35:41.482 --> 35:43.148
I kept hearing,

35:43.150 --> 35:45.617
"Man. This is wrong.
No way, no way.

35:45.619 --> 35:47.586
This can't be happening.
No way."

35:47.588 --> 35:50.122
I felt he was scared.

35:50.124 --> 35:51.823
Angel passed away
downstairs, right?

35:51.825 --> 35:52.991
In the master bedroom.

35:52.993 --> 35:55.694
So not that far away.

35:55.696 --> 35:58.764
Okay, I'm hoping Amy
wasn't feeling Angel's death,

35:58.766 --> 36:01.400
but the other things that she
described about him being scared

36:01.402 --> 36:03.435
and saying,
"This can't happen,"

36:03.437 --> 36:06.205
does that sound like
what Angel was going through?

36:06.207 --> 36:08.140
All of the stages
you go through

36:08.142 --> 36:10.576
when you find out
that you have cancer,

36:10.578 --> 36:12.911
he experienced them all.
We all did.

36:12.913 --> 36:15.914
I got to ask you, Amy --
do you think that's
Angel that you felt?

36:15.916 --> 36:18.283
I'm sorry.
I wish I knew for sure.

36:18.285 --> 36:20.552
But I could not see him.

36:20.554 --> 36:23.188
Obviously, it's not
a definitive answer for you.

36:23.190 --> 36:24.256
What's your gut tell you?

36:24.258 --> 36:27.759
That he's at peace
where he is...

36:27.761 --> 36:31.863
and I'm the one struggling
with being not at peace.

36:35.002 --> 36:36.168
Anything else?

36:36.170 --> 36:38.170
So, here's the thing.

36:38.172 --> 36:41.106
There is random dead

36:41.108 --> 36:44.309
who are constantly
coming through your house.

36:44.311 --> 36:48.180
So these dead can come and go
through the mirrors.

36:48.182 --> 36:50.549
I've encountered this before
on walks,

36:50.551 --> 36:53.785
and basically some mirrors,
for whatever reason,

36:53.787 --> 36:56.788
which I think
it's more about the location,

36:56.790 --> 37:02.194
are openings for the dead
to come and go through.

37:02.196 --> 37:04.997
What bothered me about that
bed location, the master bed,

37:04.999 --> 37:07.432
is that they're
literally walking back,

37:07.434 --> 37:10.636
like, through that bed,
constant, constant.

37:10.638 --> 37:12.537
You're consistently exposed.

37:12.539 --> 37:15.540
That is something
that can make you sick.

37:15.542 --> 37:17.643
After Angel passed away,

37:17.645 --> 37:20.812
I always wake up
with aches in my side,

37:20.814 --> 37:24.616
said I felt like I'm actually
being punched in my sleep.

37:24.618 --> 37:28.587
Yeah, that would be them
probably walking through you.

37:28.589 --> 37:31.590
So if she doesn't call us in
and Gabrielle moved in,

37:31.592 --> 37:33.091
what could have happened?

37:33.093 --> 37:36.161
I think that you would've
eventually developed

37:36.163 --> 37:40.132
some kind of long-term
and possibly terminal illness

37:40.134 --> 37:42.434
by continuing
to sleep here.

37:42.436 --> 37:45.103
You know, you're talking
about all these dead
people walking through.

37:45.105 --> 37:47.005
You had an incident with Angel
when he was alive

37:47.007 --> 37:48.607
that you thought
it wasn't him.

37:48.609 --> 37:51.076
I believe
he was possessed.

37:51.078 --> 37:52.277
He didn't look the same.

37:52.279 --> 37:54.079
His voice
was not the same.

37:54.081 --> 37:56.148
And I actually remember
stepping back

37:56.150 --> 37:57.949
because I was fearful

37:57.951 --> 38:01.787
because when I looked at him,
he wasn't my husband.

38:01.789 --> 38:04.523
Now, could this be
from people walking through?

38:04.525 --> 38:06.458
I think so.

38:06.460 --> 38:10.362
It makes complete sense to me
that he would be possessed.

38:10.364 --> 38:13.165
Yeah, you got to get
the...out of there, like...

38:13.167 --> 38:15.233
And now I'm...

38:15.235 --> 38:16.668
worried.

38:16.670 --> 38:19.871
So the big question is,
did the house make Angel sick?

38:22.443 --> 38:26.044
No. I don't think so.

38:26.046 --> 38:27.846
So you didn't cause this.

38:27.848 --> 38:29.247
You understand that?

38:31.051 --> 38:32.651
Okay.

38:32.653 --> 38:38.190
At least he got a chance
to love me before he...

38:38.192 --> 38:40.325
before he died.

38:40.327 --> 38:43.261
So even though it
was for a short time,
it was worth it.

38:46.433 --> 38:48.467
Everybody's gonna grieve.

38:48.469 --> 38:52.104
But the guilt part
you got to let go.

38:52.106 --> 38:54.539
- Okay.
- Okay?

38:56.076 --> 38:57.509
I made her cry.

39:01.915 --> 39:03.515
I'm sorry.

39:15.298 --> 39:18.099
So, Kim, if you only get
one thing out of tonight,

39:18.101 --> 39:23.071
I hope you now know
you had nothing to do
with Angel's death.

39:23.073 --> 39:25.774
As far as whether it's safe
for you to stay in the house

39:25.776 --> 39:28.309
or to have Gabrielle
move back in,

39:28.311 --> 39:30.111
I'm going to turn it over
to Amy.

39:31.681 --> 39:35.350
Before I get to that,
I am going to go into

39:35.352 --> 39:38.520
what you need to do to heal

39:38.522 --> 39:41.089
and take care of yourself.

39:41.091 --> 39:47.328
The first thing is to
see a psychotherapist
who specializes in grief

39:47.330 --> 39:49.631
for intensive therapy.

39:49.633 --> 39:55.637
And also, I want you
in a grief-counseling group

39:55.639 --> 39:58.873
because the pain
is stuck.

39:58.875 --> 40:01.009
I need to do that.

40:01.011 --> 40:06.080
I didn't actually realize
that I was...so stuck

40:06.082 --> 40:08.716
emotionally...

40:08.718 --> 40:11.252
in the grieving...state.

40:13.256 --> 40:15.023
As for the hauntings,

40:15.025 --> 40:18.193
the first thing is
you have to move your bedroom.

40:18.195 --> 40:20.528
That has to happen.
I'm sorry.

40:20.530 --> 40:22.730
But this is your health,

40:22.732 --> 40:27.368
so that needs
to be done ASAP.

40:27.370 --> 40:29.537
Next, you need
to remove both mirrors,

40:29.539 --> 40:31.439
specifically downstairs.

40:31.441 --> 40:32.774
They're contaminated.

40:32.776 --> 40:35.944
You need to get rid
of those mirrors.

40:35.946 --> 40:39.647
The next thing is
a medium needs to come in

40:39.649 --> 40:44.085
to remove...
most of the dead.

40:44.087 --> 40:48.456
They'll be able to get
rid of the black mass
and this guy here.

40:48.458 --> 40:49.757
Okay.

40:49.759 --> 40:52.360
What about your daughter?

40:52.362 --> 40:54.362
You going to have her move in
after you get this done?

40:54.364 --> 40:56.831
I don't think
I'll have her move in.

40:56.833 --> 41:01.369
Feels like
I could cause harm to her.

41:01.371 --> 41:03.972
I hate to see you
in this house by yourself.

41:03.974 --> 41:06.307
When the time comes,
when I feel comfortable,

41:06.309 --> 41:07.775
she can move back.

41:07.777 --> 41:11.112
How do you feel about the whole
investigation, how it went?

41:11.114 --> 41:13.615
I have the answers
I wanted

41:13.617 --> 41:15.083
and that I needed

41:15.085 --> 41:17.485
because you have a gift.

41:19.189 --> 41:20.688
And you help
a lot of people,

41:20.690 --> 41:22.357
whether you realize it
or not,

41:22.359 --> 41:24.292
so thank you.

41:26.530 --> 41:29.898
I really hope Kim seeks the help
of a therapist and support group

41:29.900 --> 41:33.601
to deal with the guilt she feels
over her husband's death.

41:33.603 --> 41:37.272
If she does that and contacts
a medium to remove the dead,

41:37.274 --> 41:38.540
she can begin to heal

41:38.542 --> 41:41.776
and maybe even live here
in peace with her daughter.
