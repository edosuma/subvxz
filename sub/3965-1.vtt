<i>Andy, Terry and Jason were broken men

00:07.883 --> 00:10.678

00:34.618 --> 00:36.370
So, who else is going?

00:36.495 --> 00:39.290
Just having a drink with one of Tony's mates. 
He's just got out.

00:39.498 --> 00:40.875
What's his name?

00:42.793 --> 00:44.587
Pat Tate.
You don't know him.

00:47.298 --> 00:48.591
Is Emma going?

00:48.799 --> 00:50.968
No, she's staying at home
like a good little girl.

00:51.218 --> 00:52.761
What, is it full of tarts then?

00:53.012 --> 00:55.264
Darling, you know I've only got eyes for you.

00:55.389 --> 00:56.891
Fucking glad you made it, mate.

00:57.099 --> 00:57.850
Didn't think you was coming.

00:58.184 --> 00:59.768
Well, I had to service the old woman.

00:59.894 --> 01:01.854
I had to give her an oil change.
What you want me to say?

01:02.104 --> 01:03.189
You don't have to say nothing, Carlton.

01:03.397 --> 01:04.355
I just hope she didn't wear you out, mate,

01:04.690 --> 01:06.984
'cause this place is wall-to-wall fanny.

01:07.109 --> 01:09.069
Yeah, I can see that.

01:09.320 --> 01:10.988
- Hey, Tony boy!
- Hey!

01:11.113 --> 01:13.157
Carlton, this here is Jim Gerenuk.

01:13.407 --> 01:16.160
- How you doing, mate?
- We call him Jimmy G.

01:16.285 --> 01:18.871
Hey, it's a fucking great party, Tony.

01:19.079 --> 01:20.289
- You're enjoying it?
- Yeah, I'm doing all right.

01:20.498 --> 01:21.874
- See you.
- See you, man. Nice to meet you.

01:21.999 --> 01:24.460
- Fucking Welsh cunt.
- Yeah.

01:26.504 --> 01:28.380
First thing first, mate.
Get this up your hooter.

01:30.508 --> 01:31.884
Yeah.

01:45.606 --> 01:47.775
- Oi! Oi!
- Oi, Tony!

01:47.983 --> 01:50.778
This is Carlton.
He's like my fucking brother.

01:50.986 --> 01:53.072
Carl, this is Pat.

01:53.280 --> 01:55.366
- Hello, mate. You all right?
- Yeah, nice to meet you.

01:55.616 --> 01:57.368
Don't mind us,
we're just having a little reunion.

01:57.618 --> 01:59.787
I was in the nick with these two...
Darren, Mickey.

01:59.912 --> 02:02.289
- Carlton.
- You all right?

02:02.414 --> 02:03.791
Hello, pal.

02:06.001 --> 02:07.878
<i>Everybody knew who Pat Tate was.</i>

02:08.086 --> 02:10.089
<i>He was a legend in the Essex underworld.</i>

02:10.381 --> 02:13.259
<i>After a "quiet meal"
down the Happy Eater in Basildon...</i>

02:13.384 --> 02:15.052
Pass the salt.

02:16.595 --> 02:19.056
Now cradle my balls.

02:19.306 --> 02:21.767
- You mean like that?
- Yeah, but slow down a little.

02:22.017 --> 02:23.477
Don't fucking rush it.

02:25.896 --> 02:28.357
Oi. What's that?

02:28.607 --> 02:31.152
- It's the bill, sir.
- Yeah, I can see it's the fucking bill,

02:31.318 --> 02:32.862
but I didn't ask for it, did I?

02:33.112 --> 02:36.281
I just assumed that since you hadn't ordered anything
for the last 20 minutes,

02:36.489 --> 02:37.950
that you didn't want anything else.

02:39.493 --> 02:41.787
Who are you to assume
you know anything about me?

02:41.912 --> 02:43.664
Take it away.

02:43.914 --> 02:47.251
What are you fucking looking at,
nose ointment?

02:47.501 --> 02:50.462
- What's this they've charged us for?
- Show us.

02:52.882 --> 02:56.468
- What's that?
- It's the service charge.

02:56.594 --> 02:58.053
That's very comical, son.

02:58.304 --> 03:00.472
I thought only proper restaurants charged that.

03:00.681 --> 03:01.765
You had the sit-down menus...

03:02.016 --> 03:04.059
Oh, right. So if I stood up and ate,

03:04.185 --> 03:06.187
- you'd have charged me less.
- Well, it's policy.

03:06.312 --> 03:09.273
Listen to me,
you fucking lowlife jobsworth cunt.

03:09.482 --> 03:12.359
For the last 20 minutes she's had her hand 
wrapped around my cock,

03:12.610 --> 03:13.861
and every time I get into a rhythm,

03:14.111 --> 03:17.364
one of you fucking mugs walks over 
and puts me off.

03:17.490 --> 03:19.074
Now maybe if I'd have shot my bolt,

03:19.200 --> 03:21.660
I'd have paid the service,
but you keep coming over here

03:21.785 --> 03:24.163
- and interrupting me.
- Sir, if you don't calm down,

03:24.288 --> 03:26.373
- I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
- Get your coat.

03:31.295 --> 03:32.254
Oh, well done, babe.

03:32.505 --> 03:34.089
Shut your fucking mouth!

03:34.298 --> 03:37.176
You, fuck off... now.
How much money you got in there?

03:37.384 --> 03:39.470
- What?
- How much money you got in there?!

03:39.720 --> 03:42.681
- Pat, don't do that.
- How much money you got in there, cunt?

03:44.683 --> 03:45.684
Oh, my God!

03:45.893 --> 03:47.853
Shut your fucking noise and get in the car now.

03:48.187 --> 03:49.855
Move!

03:51.899 --> 03:53.275
I'm fucking warning you...

03:53.400 --> 03:55.653
you say a fucking word,
all of you get what that cunt got.

04:05.204 --> 04:07.957
Would you mind stopping all that
and stepping outside the car, sir?

04:08.082 --> 04:10.584
Fucking hell.

04:11.919 --> 04:13.254
Hiya.

04:13.587 --> 04:15.464
<i>He was gonna get 10 years for it.</i>

04:15.714 --> 04:17.966
<i>10 years for stealing 800 quid.</i>

04:18.216 --> 04:20.052
<i>That's less than 100 quid a year.</i>

04:20.302 --> 04:22.555
<i>But you know what?</i>

04:22.805 --> 04:25.182
<i>Pat had other plans.</i>

04:26.600 --> 04:27.977
Go! Go! Go!

04:28.185 --> 04:32.479
<i>The police tried to set up a roadblock,
but Pat was too quick.</i>

04:32.982 --> 04:36.068
<i>He slipped off to Spain
but was rearrested in Gibraltar visiting friends.</i>

04:43.701 --> 04:46.162
Cor! Fuck me, it's only Tom Cruise.

04:46.412 --> 04:48.080
Mate, let me get a pen and paper,

04:48.289 --> 04:49.290
I want to get your autograph.

04:49.498 --> 04:51.584
My fucking bird would love that.

04:58.591 --> 05:00.551
Hey, Craig, say hello to my man Carlton.

05:01.886 --> 05:03.679
We've met.

05:05.514 --> 05:07.766
You want to tell me something?

05:08.017 --> 05:11.061
No. I'm sorry.

05:11.312 --> 05:12.855
Tony, I didn't know he was a friend of yours.

05:12.980 --> 05:15.191
- If I'd known...
- Let me just say to you, fellow,

05:15.316 --> 05:18.152
it ain't a good idea to go out drinking
on an empty head, all right?

05:18.402 --> 05:20.154
Are you looking to get hurt?

05:25.993 --> 05:27.870
You've fucked up now, son.

05:29.497 --> 05:34.251
Get the fuck out of here,
you fucking useless muggy cunt!

05:34.502 --> 05:36.587
Fuck's sake!

05:39.882 --> 05:42.551
You ever mouth off to Carlton Leach like that again,

05:42.718 --> 05:44.887
and I swear I'll leave you
where I fucking find you.

05:45.012 --> 05:46.555
Now fuck off, cunt!

05:46.889 --> 05:50.559
<i>The thing about Craig was, he didn't exactly 
have the best start in life.</i>

05:50.809 --> 05:54.480
<i>His mom had been knocking off
some toy boy called John,</i>

05:54.605 --> 05:57.358
<i>but she had to put a stop to it
when her old man got her up the duff.</i>

05:57.608 --> 06:01.153
<i>It would be an understatement to say 
the lad took it badly.</i>

06:18.504 --> 06:20.673
I did this to prove how much I love you.

06:22.508 --> 06:24.677
I love you, baby.
I done this for both of us.

06:37.398 --> 06:38.983
<i>Poor bastard never stood a chance.</i>

06:39.108 --> 06:41.986
<i>He was a fuck up before he was even born.</i>

06:42.194 --> 06:45.281
<i>Tony paid his mortgage,
and in return Craig was his runner.</i>

06:45.281 --> 06:46.574
<i>He took all the risks.</i>

06:46.907 --> 06:48.576
<i>If Tony needed a couple of kilos 
of puff picked up,</i>

06:48.784 --> 06:50.286
<i>or a few hundred pills dropped off,</i>

06:50.494 --> 06:51.662
<i>well, he'd just give him a call.</i>

06:51.996 --> 06:54.165
What the fuck are you cunts looking at?

06:58.711 --> 07:02.965
<i>Tony brought Pat into the firm 
and gave him control over a couple of doors,</i>

07:03.215 --> 07:05.968
<i>and a legitimate job title 
to keep his probation officer sweet.</i>

07:06.093 --> 07:09.555
You know, Tony, you've got to forget 
charging those scumbags to deal in your clubs.

07:09.805 --> 07:12.266
I mean they pay you a poxy fucking grand a week

07:12.516 --> 07:15.769
and they're nicking 12,
13 large over a weekend.

07:15.895 --> 07:18.063
- That's the way it goes, mate.
- No, it ain't. Fuck 'em.

07:18.314 --> 07:20.566
You've got to get into this business proper, mate.

07:20.691 --> 07:22.776
You've got to get them dealers
to buy wholesale from you.

07:22.985 --> 07:24.862
Listen. I've got all the contacts sorted out.

07:25.112 --> 07:27.656
You buy the pills at a fraction of the selling price

07:27.907 --> 07:29.783
and you knock them out to the dealers at Â£6 a pop.

07:29.992 --> 07:33.454
I'm saying we can smash the life out of this 
and earn a fortune.

07:35.206 --> 07:37.249
Rolfe, you mother's cunt!

07:37.500 --> 07:39.084
- Where the fuck is he?
- He's not here, Tucker.

07:39.293 --> 07:40.753
It's truth or violence...
your fucking choice.

07:41.003 --> 07:42.588
He's not fucking here.
I swear it.

07:42.796 --> 07:46.550
Why not be original and be 
the first fucking bitch in history to tell the truth?

07:46.592 --> 07:47.885
You lying cunt!

07:49.595 --> 07:51.972
Fucking cunt!

07:52.097 --> 07:55.059
Come here, wanker!
Come here!

08:03.484 --> 08:05.569
What are you doing, Tony?

08:05.694 --> 08:07.655
You could've fucking killed me!

08:07.905 --> 08:10.157
I wish I had, you unreliable little cunt!

08:10.282 --> 08:11.784
I've been calling you all fucking day

08:11.992 --> 08:14.787
- and you don't answer!
- I was fucked up...

08:14.995 --> 08:17.873
- In bed!
- I've had to make two handoffs myself.

08:18.082 --> 08:19.959
Now what if I'd gotten fucking nicked?

08:20.209 --> 08:22.878
I'm sorry, Tony.
I'm sorry.

08:23.003 --> 08:24.672
"I'm sorry."

08:25.005 --> 08:26.465
You're a fucking waste of space, Craig.

08:26.715 --> 08:28.050
You're off the fucking firm!

08:28.217 --> 08:29.176
If you want your mortgage paid,

08:29.510 --> 08:32.679
you can whistle out of your ass for it,
you fucking useless cunt!

08:34.181 --> 08:36.350
<i>The firm was Craig's life,</i>

08:36.600 --> 08:38.184
<i>and without it he had no direction,</i>

08:38.309 --> 08:39.562
<i>no purpose.</i>

08:39.812 --> 08:41.981
<i>He wanted to be back inside,</i>

08:42.106 --> 08:43.357
<i>no matter what.</i>

09:02.418 --> 09:04.879
Have a seat, sir.
Fancy a puff of that?

09:05.004 --> 09:06.672
No, have you got anything stronger?

09:08.382 --> 09:10.259
I thought you were off the heavy stuff.

09:10.509 --> 09:12.678
Yeah, I am. 
I have a little dabble now and again,

09:12.887 --> 09:14.471
but basically I'm clean.

09:16.390 --> 09:18.350
Are you sure?
It's good stuff, pretty boy.

09:21.103 --> 09:22.688
Don't call him pretty boy.

09:22.897 --> 09:24.482
Why not? He's pretty.

09:27.485 --> 09:29.153
Why don't you just fuck him then?

09:29.403 --> 09:31.989
Look, mate. I don't want to get
in the middle of some domestic, do I?

09:32.114 --> 09:33.365
Oh, she's been on my case all day.

09:33.616 --> 09:36.577
Just ignore her,
then she might fuck off.

09:38.996 --> 09:41.665
That's fucking charming.
Look at the fucking state of her.

09:41.916 --> 09:44.376
All right, mate. Just get over it
and let's do some business, yeah?

09:46.504 --> 09:49.590
Right, here's your 20 kilos.
So where's the money?

09:56.805 --> 09:58.390
I ain't got no money.

09:58.516 --> 10:01.477
Now why would I bother paying
a fucking insect like you?

10:02.895 --> 10:04.688
Who you calling a fucking insect?

10:04.897 --> 10:06.690
What would you prefer?

10:06.816 --> 10:09.360
Ex-scaghead two-bob junkie cunt?

10:10.611 --> 10:12.071
Fucking cunt!

10:12.279 --> 10:13.989
So fucking easy.

10:30.798 --> 10:32.174
Fuck. Come here.

10:46.689 --> 10:51.152
You ain't gonna get far
with 50 mils of Largactil in your beer.

10:54.905 --> 10:57.158
I know you like drugs, Chris.

10:59.493 --> 11:00.953
You've had a right touch.

11:01.203 --> 11:03.581
'Cause tonight...

11:03.789 --> 11:07.751
I'm gonna give you all the drugs
you'll ever need.

11:38.991 --> 11:40.868
Don't look so upset, mate.

11:42.703 --> 11:44.371
It's a freebie.

11:44.580 --> 11:47.166
I know you're a little skint at the moment,

11:47.291 --> 11:50.085
what with you owing Tony two grand.

11:50.085 --> 11:52.254
What are you talking about?

11:52.505 --> 11:54.256
What are you talking about?

11:54.507 --> 11:58.552
You thought you were gonna swerve him,

11:58.719 --> 12:02.681
but I'm here to fucking collect.

12:13.609 --> 12:15.277
What have you given him?

12:15.611 --> 12:17.279
Ketamine.

12:21.992 --> 12:24.578
Hey, babe, get me a beer.

12:24.787 --> 12:27.665
Yeah, sure.
Does Chris want one?

12:27.706 --> 12:30.876
Nah. He's had enough tonight.

12:41.887 --> 12:43.264
Why are we stopping?

12:43.597 --> 12:44.974
Just dropping Chris off, babe.

12:46.308 --> 12:48.185
Yeah, but he doesn't live here, does he?

13:01.699 --> 13:03.784
Get out there, you fat cunt.

13:15.421 --> 13:17.256
You ain't gonna fucking believe this.

13:17.506 --> 13:19.466
He's only gone and killed Chris.

13:19.717 --> 13:22.970
You can say he's 
a fucking useless spastic shit-cunt,

13:23.095 --> 13:26.182
but if that's not dedication,
I don't know what fucking is.

13:26.390 --> 13:28.767
He's a fucking liability, isn't he?

13:29.018 --> 13:31.479
What's he doing going around murdering
some kid for two grand?

13:32.605 --> 13:34.482
Tony, it's unnecessary.

13:34.815 --> 13:36.984
No, he's all right, Carl.

13:37.109 --> 13:39.862
Anyway, I already told him
he's back in the firm, mate.

13:53.209 --> 13:57.588
<i>Baby, I need you here with me 
because I'm trying...</i>

13:57.880 --> 13:59.381
<i>Along with working together,</i>

13:59.507 --> 14:01.550
<i>me and Tony did a couple of little earners 
on the side.</i>

14:01.800 --> 14:04.470
<i>Jimmy G had set up a deal
for some stolen traveler's checks,</i>

14:04.595 --> 14:07.264
<i>but after four canceled meets,
Tony had got the hump.</i>

14:07.389 --> 14:09.558
My time ain't fucking free.

14:09.683 --> 14:12.978
I've been up and down the A13 
nine times for that cunt,

14:13.187 --> 14:15.981
and he gobbed off to Emma
about me fucking that Chinky bird.

14:16.190 --> 14:17.483
She's been at me all fucking week.

14:17.691 --> 14:19.360
Me and Craig are gonna punish the cunt.

14:19.610 --> 14:20.861
You wanna come?

14:21.195 --> 14:23.572
Look, if you're gonna slap the geezer, 
just fucking slap him.

14:23.697 --> 14:25.574
What do you need me and Craig for?

14:25.908 --> 14:28.285
'Cause we're gonna do a demolition job
on the cunt, that's why.

14:28.410 --> 14:30.454
Oh, look, leave it out, all right?

14:30.704 --> 14:33.791
- You need to calm down, don't you?
- You don't want in?

14:33.916 --> 14:36.585
No. No, I don't want in.

14:36.794 --> 14:39.171
- Oi, Jimmy. Hurry up, will you?
- What's happening, Jim?

14:42.383 --> 14:44.385
- All right, boys?
- How are you, mate? You all right?

14:50.182 --> 14:51.851
- Fuck.
- Get the fuck back, Tony!

14:52.101 --> 14:54.854
- I'll fucking kill you.
- I'm fucking doing it! I swear to God!

14:55.104 --> 14:56.856
Calm down!
I'll fucking hit you!

14:57.106 --> 14:59.483
Come on...

14:59.692 --> 15:01.986
Get off me!

15:06.282 --> 15:08.075
Tony, I fucking love you.
Please don't hurt me.

15:08.284 --> 15:09.577
Don't listen to him, Tony!

15:09.910 --> 15:11.162
Think of all the agg he's cause you!

15:11.412 --> 15:16.959
Yeah, all the agg you've caused me,
you fucking shit-cunt!

15:17.084 --> 15:19.253
What do you think, Jimmy?

15:19.503 --> 15:23.382
Craig, take the TV, video and hi-fi
and shove it in the back of the motor.

15:23.716 --> 15:25.676
I'm fining you, Jimmy.
Is that fair enough?

15:25.885 --> 15:28.679
- Get off!
- Burn him, Tony.

15:28.888 --> 15:30.681
- Burn him.
- No, don't burn me!

15:30.806 --> 15:32.975
- Burn the cunt! Burn him, Tony!
- No, please.

15:40.191 --> 15:42.067
Tony, no!

15:46.405 --> 15:50.576
Tony! Fuck you! Please! Oh, God!

15:53.204 --> 15:55.164
Oh, fuck.

15:58.083 --> 15:59.752
Fuck you!

16:02.588 --> 16:06.383
- No more, Tony.
- "No more"? We've hardly even started.

16:06.383 --> 16:08.886
Fuck you! Fuck you!

16:12.389 --> 16:14.058
You cunt!

16:17.102 --> 16:18.979
You bastard!

16:20.189 --> 16:22.483
Craig, what you fucking let him get away for?

16:22.691 --> 16:24.151
I had the CD player in me hands.

16:24.485 --> 16:25.553
Fucking soppy cunt.

16:25.703 --> 16:28.989
You're rolling around on the floor for two minutes,
you fucking idiot.

16:30.282 --> 16:31.867
Now get in the fucking motor.

16:38.499 --> 16:40.251
- Yes?
- Are you Jimmy's dad?

16:40.501 --> 16:41.877
Yeah, why?
What's this about?

16:42.086 --> 16:44.964
- Is he in?
- No, why? What's this about?

16:45.089 --> 16:47.883
'Cause we're looking for him,
you fucking Welsh cunt.

16:48.092 --> 16:52.555
You fucking tell him to meet us face to face
or I'm gonna come in there

16:52.680 --> 16:55.182
and start cutting your daughter's fingers off 
one at a time.

16:55.307 --> 16:57.268
- You got that?
- Yeah.

16:57.393 --> 16:58.853
I said have you got that?
Have you fucking got that?

16:59.103 --> 17:00.688
Yeah, I got it.

17:51.405 --> 17:53.157
Jimmy, don't! Please don't!

17:55.993 --> 17:58.370
You fucking... you fucking cunt!

17:58.496 --> 18:00.789
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

18:00.998 --> 18:02.750
Are you all right?
Is the baby all right?

18:06.003 --> 18:08.672
- Fucking Jimmy!
- Pat!

18:10.090 --> 18:13.677
You fucking cunt!
Come back!

18:13.886 --> 18:17.056
You fucking mug!
I'm gonna kill you, you cunt!

18:17.181 --> 18:21.060
- I'm gonna kill you!
- Pat! Come back!

18:24.396 --> 18:26.857
Yo, Jimmy!
Where the fuck are you?

18:28.609 --> 18:31.570
- Jimmy.
- Jimmy!

18:31.821 --> 18:33.864
Jimmy's fucking gone.

18:34.114 --> 18:35.866
Jimmy's fucking dead!

18:41.080 --> 18:42.456
Fucking hell! Run!

18:44.083 --> 18:45.251
Fucking...

18:52.800 --> 18:54.260
Fuck you! Come on!

18:58.097 --> 18:59.890
Who's laughing now?

19:00.099 --> 19:03.060
Welcome to the fucking neighborhood!

19:07.982 --> 19:09.150
Evening.

19:11.193 --> 19:12.862
This is supposed to be a hospital, isn't it?

19:13.112 --> 19:15.489
What's the matter with you?

19:15.698 --> 19:17.366
Do you want a line, Carlton?

19:17.616 --> 19:19.160
You lads are taking the piss, huh?

19:19.410 --> 19:21.078
Yeah, fucking right we are, mate.

19:22.580 --> 19:24.456
Here, have a go with Sadie.

19:24.707 --> 19:26.375
- That's Sandy.
- Yeah, whatever.

19:26.584 --> 19:28.961
I'm paying her a fucking three-a a day

19:29.211 --> 19:30.754
and she likes to earn her money.
Don't you, babe?

19:31.005 --> 19:34.049
- Sucks a fucking blinding cock.
- I sure do.

19:34.300 --> 19:36.177
- No, you're all right, love.
- Are you sure?

19:36.385 --> 19:38.387
- It's no bother.
- No thanks.

19:43.392 --> 19:44.977
You remember Darren, don't you?

19:45.186 --> 19:47.480
- Yeah, we met at your party.
- Yeah.

19:47.688 --> 19:49.190
- Yeah, I was with Mickey.
- Yeah, the old geezer.

19:49.482 --> 19:51.358
We was all in the nick together. 

19:51.609 --> 19:54.069
Yeah, well, you'll be back in there
if Old Bill turn up here, see this place.

19:54.119 --> 19:55.863
Look at the state you're in.

19:56.113 --> 19:57.865
There's fucking cocaine 
all over the bed, Tony.

19:57.990 --> 20:00.075
Who in this hospital is gonna fucking grass us up?

20:02.703 --> 20:04.663
I still can't believe it was Jimmy 
that put you in here.

20:06.582 --> 20:10.753
Yeah? Well, that no-good cunt's
gonna end up in fucking box when I get ahold of him.

20:11.003 --> 20:13.380
Craig, visiting time is over.
Get these others out of here.

20:13.506 --> 20:16.967
- But we've been having so much fun.
- Fuck off.

20:18.385 --> 20:20.679
I'll see you later, Pat.

20:20.888 --> 20:22.264
I'll give your best to Mickey.

20:22.515 --> 20:24.475
Come on, babe.
Come on, babe.

20:26.310 --> 20:27.853
Here, Darren.

20:28.020 --> 20:29.980
Don't forget to tell Mickey
about that little bit of business.

20:30.189 --> 20:31.357
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Sweet.

20:34.902 --> 20:36.570
Here, Carlton.

20:36.821 --> 20:38.989
I need you to get Jimmy down here.

20:39.198 --> 20:40.783
Tell him I want to sort things out
and put an end to this,

20:40.991 --> 20:42.785
but I need you to get him down here 
and we'll do the rest.

20:43.118 --> 20:44.662
Meaning?

20:44.912 --> 20:46.372
Meaning I'm gonna do him with this.

20:46.580 --> 20:48.582
And I'll get rid of the gun and the body.

20:48.791 --> 20:50.459
Oh, that's a fucking cracking idea.

20:50.709 --> 20:53.462
You're just gonna go
and shoot someone in a fucking hospital?

20:53.712 --> 20:56.173
Behave yourself, will you?
You're on parole, Pat.

20:56.382 --> 20:57.883
Yeah, well, fuck all that.
That wrong'un has gotta go

20:58.008 --> 21:00.761
because he's made me and him 
look like a right pair of cunts.

21:01.011 --> 21:03.889
All right.
Well, you just get well

21:04.098 --> 21:06.475
and I'll come see you in Chelmsford nick,

21:06.600 --> 21:07.977
all right?

21:24.618 --> 21:27.580
- Hello?
<i>- Carlton, it's Jimmy.</i>

21:27.705 --> 21:30.374
He said they'd rape my sister.

21:30.499 --> 21:32.459
They threatened my dad.

21:32.710 --> 21:34.378
They smashed up my house.

21:34.587 --> 21:37.590
They call me 10 times a day,
leaving threats on my answerphone.

21:42.595 --> 21:44.472
Don't cry, son.
All right?

21:44.680 --> 21:46.182
It's not gonna help.

21:48.017 --> 21:50.269
I can't believe they turned on me like that.

21:50.519 --> 21:52.271
I shot at Pat because I knew...

21:52.480 --> 21:54.356
I knew there was no other way.

21:56.400 --> 21:58.152
They'll never stop now.

21:59.320 --> 22:00.779
Never.

22:02.114 --> 22:04.074
Until I'm dead.

22:04.283 --> 22:06.869
Let me speak to Tony
and I'll see what I can do.

22:06.911 --> 22:09.580
It's too late for that, Carl.
It's too fucking late for that.

22:12.791 --> 22:15.669
There's only one way to make sure
my family stays safe.

22:21.300 --> 22:22.760
I wanna die.

22:23.093 --> 22:24.970
You just slow down.

22:25.221 --> 22:27.056
No, listen. I know you're
as harsh as they are, Carlton,

22:27.306 --> 22:29.558
but at least you're always fair.
At least you're always fucking fair.

22:31.811 --> 22:34.063
Tony doesn't have a set of rules 
you can live by.

22:37.316 --> 22:39.360
I need you...

22:39.610 --> 22:41.987
I need you to kill me.

22:42.196 --> 22:43.656
You what?

22:43.989 --> 22:46.575
I'm too scared to do it by myself.

22:50.913 --> 22:52.456
Please...

22:53.791 --> 22:55.376
protect my family...

22:57.002 --> 22:58.963
and shoot me.

23:00.714 --> 23:04.760
You can't ask me that.
You can't ask anybody...

23:04.885 --> 23:06.679
I don't know what else to do.

23:08.180 --> 23:09.890
I don't know what else to do.

23:14.520 --> 23:17.273
Well, you can start by putting the gun down.

23:21.110 --> 23:25.156
And then you get yourself out of Essex
and you lay low for awhile.

23:25.406 --> 23:27.783
You keep yourself out of fucking trouble

23:27.992 --> 23:30.661
and I'll see what I can do.
Do you hear me?

23:30.786 --> 23:32.580
<i>Well, it was bound to fucking happen.</i>

23:32.788 --> 23:37.168
<i>The nurse came in and changed Pat's bed
while he was in surgery and found his gun.</i>

23:37.293 --> 23:40.379
<i>Pat went straight back to prison 
on violation of his parole.</i>

23:40.504 --> 23:43.966
<i>Couple of days later, 
Jimmy was picked up with an unlicensed firearm.</i>

23:44.216 --> 23:45.885
<i>Although it wasn't the gun that shot Pat,</i>

23:46.010 --> 23:48.554
<i>it was still enough to put him behind bars 
for a stretch.</i>

23:48.721 --> 23:50.473
<i>Best place for him, really.</i>

23:50.681 --> 23:51.891
<i>He'd be safer on the inside.</i>

24:02.109 --> 24:03.777
All right, Carlton?

24:15.706 --> 24:17.958
Fuck me. What's this?
You ain't on brown as well, are you?

24:18.209 --> 24:20.961
- It's Nubain.
- Looks like heroin to me.

24:21.212 --> 24:23.881
- Well, it fucking ain't, all right?
- I can vouch for that, Carlton.

24:25.299 --> 24:27.384
You? Don't make me laugh.

24:28.803 --> 24:30.262
I think we'd better have a talk.

24:34.892 --> 24:36.352
What's him and that walking clap doing here?

24:36.602 --> 24:38.354
They make me fucking itch just looking at them.

24:38.604 --> 24:40.356
Can't you just get along with them for me, Carl?

24:41.816 --> 24:43.150
I put up with the cunt.
That's about it.

24:45.194 --> 24:47.655
Anyway, I thought you was knocking it on the head 
now that Pat's inside.

24:49.490 --> 24:51.367
When was the last time you were clean, 
for fuck's sake?

24:51.617 --> 24:54.286
Fuck clean.
I can work 22 hours a day like this.

24:54.495 --> 24:56.080
Yeah, but for how long?

24:56.205 --> 24:57.957
You'll be fucking dead carrying on like that.

25:01.919 --> 25:03.587
What's the story with this kitchen?

25:03.796 --> 25:05.589
I thought you said that geezer 
would have it done by now.

25:05.881 --> 25:08.259
- So did I.
- He's taking a fucking piss, isn't he?

25:09.510 --> 25:11.262
Come and check this out.

25:12.680 --> 25:14.473
I had to teach him not to fuck with me, Carlton.

25:19.311 --> 25:21.355
Definitely something wrong with you.

25:42.501 --> 25:43.379
Come on!

25:43.588 --> 25:47.381
<i>It had been almost a year
since Pat had gone back to prison.</i> 

25:47.590 --> 25:51.677
<i>Tony and Craig were becoming increasingly powerful
in the drug world while he was inside.</i>

25:51.802 --> 25:54.388
<i>Pat wanted to get right back in with them.</i>

25:54.513 --> 25:57.183
You all right, son?
You look a bit long in the boat.

25:57.391 --> 26:00.269
Who fucked your mother?
Tell us, we'll sort him out.

26:00.311 --> 26:02.354
He's a cunt, ain't he?

26:02.605 --> 26:05.774
How would you like to come
on a little deal with us?

26:05.983 --> 26:08.152
Be a good little earner.
Tell him, Pat.

26:08.402 --> 26:11.155
Mickey Steele's got a shipment 
coming in from Holland.

26:11.280 --> 26:13.157
Â£300 a kilo.
Not cheap, I know,

26:13.407 --> 26:16.875
but he reckons there's no fucking chance
of anybody getting pulled by customs.

26:16.984 --> 26:18.162
And how do you know that?

26:18.287 --> 26:20.873
Because they don't get some fucking mug
to bring it in on the ferry.

26:20.998 --> 26:23.375
They bring it across the channel on a powerboat.

26:23.584 --> 26:25.085
They've done it fucking 100 times.

26:45.981 --> 26:49.151
Now Mickey needs 80 large up front 
to get the gear.

26:49.193 --> 26:50.778
He's in for Â£15,000.
I'm in for Â£40,000.

26:50.986 --> 26:53.155
Fucking Â£40,000?
You ain't got 40 large, Pat.

26:53.405 --> 26:54.782
Yeah, but I will in a couple of days, won't I?

26:55.115 --> 26:57.660
- How's that then?
- Tony, I fucking told you twice.

26:57.910 --> 26:59.578
I've got all these contacts sorted out.

26:59.787 --> 27:02.456
You make me laugh. 
I didn't spend all my fucking time in the nick wanking.

27:02.581 --> 27:04.583
- Yes, you fucking did.
- Yeah, you're right.

27:04.917 --> 27:07.378
"Fucking let me out!"

27:10.881 --> 27:12.550
I don't know. We'll see, all right?

27:12.800 --> 27:13.968
Shut up.
What's the matter with you?

27:14.218 --> 27:16.470
Even the fucking dancing monkey's in for Â£6,000.

27:18.806 --> 27:21.684
Tony, look, do me a favor,
you fill him in on the rest,

27:21.809 --> 27:24.270
'cause I've got to try my luck
with that little blonde tart over there.

27:26.689 --> 27:29.358
- What do you reckon?
- Filth, mate.

27:29.608 --> 27:31.277
No, utter fucking filth.

27:31.402 --> 27:33.362
With a little bit of luck,
I might get a golden shower tonight.

27:42.788 --> 27:44.290
So what do you reckon, mate?

27:44.498 --> 27:46.167
No, I ain't got the dough, all right?

27:46.500 --> 27:48.169
I've got nothing put aside.

27:48.419 --> 27:49.670
You heard what Pat said,

27:49.920 --> 27:51.881
you're guaranteed to double up your money on this.

27:52.006 --> 27:54.675
Yeah, well, his idea of a guarantee and mine 
are two different things.

27:54.800 --> 27:56.552
I'm just trying to help you out, mate.

27:56.719 --> 27:58.971
Yeah, I know. I appreciate it.

27:59.180 --> 28:00.681
I don't want to fall out over this, all right?

28:00.806 --> 28:04.685
You're my brother, Carlton,
and I fucking love you.

28:04.894 --> 28:06.979
It's good to know someone
is looking out for me.

28:07.188 --> 28:08.981
Yeah, always. You know that.

28:14.695 --> 28:17.364
Do me a favor, just be careful of him.

28:21.494 --> 28:23.787
- Get off me!
- Go! Go!

28:23.996 --> 28:25.664
<i>Pat was at it again,</i>

28:25.915 --> 28:27.958
<i>and even Tony could see
he had become a liability.</i>

28:28.209 --> 28:29.376
<i>In a drug-fueled rage,</i>

28:29.585 --> 28:33.881
<i>he threw the one person who still stuck by him,
Kate Carter, out of his house.</i>

28:34.089 --> 28:38.052
<i>She ran straight to Mickey Steele,
her closest friend while Pat was inside.</i>

28:38.219 --> 28:41.180
<i>Then the dope deal went tits up
when it turned out the gear was moody.</i>

28:41.305 --> 28:43.974
<i>You couldn't even burn it,
let alone smoke it.</i>

28:44.099 --> 28:45.351
Mick, listen to me.

28:45.601 --> 28:47.686
You couldn't con a fucking 12-year-old 
with that fucking gear.

28:47.895 --> 28:50.064
It's shit and I'm down fucking Â£40,000.

28:50.189 --> 28:52.066
- I'll sort it out.
- You fucking will, you slippery cunt,

28:52.316 --> 28:54.568
or I'm gonna come around there
and fucking sort you out.

28:54.693 --> 28:56.779
- Jesus Christ, Pat.
- Jesus Christ?

28:56.987 --> 28:59.865
Jesus fucking Christ?
You'll be fucking screaming that, you mug,

29:00.115 --> 29:02.284
when I fucking come around there
and do you with this blade,

29:02.493 --> 29:03.869
you fucking no-good cunt!

29:03.994 --> 29:05.454
<i>Pat may have been a fucking loon,</i>

29:05.788 --> 29:07.581
<i>but this time he was ranting
for a good reason.</i>

29:07.790 --> 29:11.377
<i>He'd only gone and borrowed Â£40,000 
off the most feared criminals in Essex...</i>

29:11.502 --> 29:12.671
<i>the Hexell brothers.</i>

29:12.796 --> 29:15.756
<i>The deal was that in two weeks time
he'd pay them back Â£50,000.</i>

29:15.881 --> 29:17.550
Look, he's been to Amsterdam 
two or three times,

29:17.800 --> 29:19.260
this time he lost the gear.

29:19.593 --> 29:22.763
I swear on my fucking life 
I wouldn't dream about having you two over.

29:22.888 --> 29:25.182
Mickey Steele's done this to all of us.

29:25.391 --> 29:26.851
Mickey Steele's your fucking mate.
Why would he do that?

29:27.101 --> 29:28.769
Let me get ahold of him,
I'll bring him in front of you,

29:29.103 --> 29:31.689
I'll put a blade to his throat
and when you're satisfied, I'll do him.

29:31.814 --> 29:33.983
<i>They gave him a month 
to come up with the goods.</i>

29:34.108 --> 29:35.360
<i>And after a lot of agg,</i>

29:35.694 --> 29:38.863
<i>Darren Nicholls and Mickey Steele
went to Amsterdam and recovered the money.</i>

29:39.113 --> 29:40.865
<i>Pat and the boys may have got their dough back,</i>

29:41.115 --> 29:43.159
<i>but that was it.
They hadn't made a bean.</i>

29:43.284 --> 29:44.869
<i>They'd had their time wasted,</i>

29:45.202 --> 29:48.581
<i>and Pat, he was still Â£10,000 short
of what he owed the brothers.</i>

29:49.790 --> 29:50.958
It's fucking lovely.

29:51.208 --> 29:52.668
Yeah, a nice bit of kit.

30:03.095 --> 30:05.890
Are you gonna help a girl in trouble, Mickey?

30:06.098 --> 30:08.184
You can stay here as long as you need.

30:08.392 --> 30:10.561
Don't worry about it.

30:10.811 --> 30:14.273
Pat is shouting his mouth off about you 
to anyone who'll listen.

30:14.398 --> 30:17.776
He said your operation's a joke
and that you ripped him off.

30:17.985 --> 30:19.487
He's a junkie.

30:19.612 --> 30:22.072
He's a fucking steroid freak.

30:25.701 --> 30:27.953
And that don't worry you?

30:28.204 --> 30:29.580
He's out of control.

30:29.914 --> 30:31.957
He says he's gonna kill you.

30:32.208 --> 30:34.084
He's all mouth.

30:34.293 --> 30:35.961
He's a fucking idiot.

30:38.714 --> 30:40.466
I don't know, Mickey.

30:42.718 --> 30:45.054
His threats seem pretty thorough to me.

30:46.597 --> 30:48.265
Look at me.

30:49.809 --> 30:56.190
I don't have a home to go to
and my child is staying at my mom's.

31:00.611 --> 31:03.280
What sort of a situation is that, Mickey?

31:05.199 --> 31:08.285
- Do you trust me, Kate?
- Of course I do.

31:08.494 --> 31:10.371
Then listen to me.

31:10.579 --> 31:14.667
I'm old school,
been around the block a few times.

31:14.917 --> 31:17.461
Mugs like Pat Tate come around
every once in a while.

31:19.296 --> 31:20.756
But you know something?

31:21.090 --> 31:22.383
What?

31:22.591 --> 31:25.469
The loud ones never last, Kate.

31:27.012 --> 31:28.389
He'll get what's coming to him.

31:31.892 --> 31:33.978
<i>Move your body</i>

31:35.396 --> 31:37.189
Yeah, can I have a 12", please?

31:39.692 --> 31:41.277
What? What do you mean
you don't do four toppings?

31:41.485 --> 31:43.279
- It's a pizza shop.
- Give me the phone.

31:45.197 --> 31:47.074
What's your problem, mate?

31:47.283 --> 31:48.951
<i>Well, why can't we have
all four fucking toppings?</i>

31:49.201 --> 31:50.161
Because it's not on the menu, sir.

31:50.411 --> 31:51.787
What are you talking about,
fucking "on the menu"?

31:51.996 --> 31:53.455
We're talking about cheese, you cunt.

31:53.706 --> 31:56.250
Listen. Deliver the fucking pizza she wants,

31:56.500 --> 31:59.170
or I'll come down there
and fucking open you up.

31:59.420 --> 32:03.257
Sir, this phone delivery line is actually 
only for people over the age of 12.

32:03.507 --> 32:07.261
Now if you'd like to calm down
and get your mommy or dad to phone back,

32:07.595 --> 32:09.054
I'll be happy to send you a pizza.

32:09.180 --> 32:11.474
- Who am I talking to?
- My name is Roger Spooner, sir.

32:11.682 --> 32:12.850
- I'm the manager.
<i>- Well, Rog,</i>

32:13.017 --> 32:14.768
you do yourself a fucking favor, mate,

32:15.019 --> 32:17.271
'cause this is your last chance
for a fucking peaceful night.

32:17.480 --> 32:19.273
Deliver the fucking pizza she wants

32:19.482 --> 32:21.852
or your mom and dad will be down 
at the fucking morgue 

32:21.917 --> 32:23.276
<i>at 4:00 in the morning 
identifying your fucking body.</i>

32:23.485 --> 32:25.070
<i>Do you got me, cunt?</i>

32:28.699 --> 32:30.951
Where's Roger fucking Spooner?

32:31.202 --> 32:33.078
- Where is he?
- That's me. Can I help you?

32:35.289 --> 32:37.875
Fucking mug me off down the fucking phone line, 
you cunt?

32:40.711 --> 32:43.464
If I asked you now for fucking four toppings,

32:43.714 --> 32:45.090
you'd give them to me, you cunt, 
wouldn't you?

32:45.216 --> 32:46.383
- Yeah, yeah.
- You'd fucking give them to me, wouldn't you?

32:46.717 --> 32:48.469
- Yes!
- Okay.

32:57.895 --> 33:00.272
Anyone got a fucking problem
with what I just done? Eh?

33:00.481 --> 33:02.066
You've got a fucking problem?

33:02.316 --> 33:04.068
Fat bollocks, you've got a fucking problem?

33:08.113 --> 33:09.573
Eh?

33:09.698 --> 33:12.076
<i>Pat's continuing war
with the fast-food industry</i>

33:12.284 --> 33:15.371
<i>resulted in the geezer giving
a detailed statement to the police.</i>

33:15.496 --> 33:17.581
<i>Come morning, he found out who Pat was</i>

33:17.790 --> 33:20.668
<i>and suddenly pizza boy had
a bad case of amnesia.</i>

33:20.793 --> 33:22.878
<i>Pat, Tony and Craig were out of control.</i>

33:23.003 --> 33:24.880
<i>They just did whatever they fucking liked.</i>

33:25.089 --> 33:28.968
<i>They robbed who they wanted
and destroyed any cunt that got in their way.</i>

34:12.386 --> 34:13.679
<i>While you're doing that,
I'm gonna take the vegetables.</i>

34:13.888 --> 34:19.560
<i>I've peeled them and I'm roughly chopping
the swede, the carrots and the parsnips.</i>

34:19.685 --> 34:21.562
<i>Of course everything's going to be 
blended up in the mixer at the end.</i>

34:21.812 --> 34:23.856
<i>If you prefer a chunky soup...</i>

34:24.106 --> 34:26.484
That will be your boyfriend.

34:26.609 --> 34:30.779
<i>and then you can still have the chunky vegetables
left in your soup.</i>

34:30.987 --> 34:33.072
It ain't for me.

34:41.290 --> 34:42.750
- Hello?
<i>- Carlton.</i>

34:43.000 --> 34:45.252
Sledge, what do you want?

34:45.503 --> 34:47.170
<i>Have you seen the telly this morning?</i>

34:47.379 --> 34:49.672
Not much.
She's got some bollocks on here.

34:49.882 --> 34:51.967
<i>Well, try the news.
I'm serious, mate.</i>

34:52.217 --> 34:54.261
<i>I think something might have happened 
to Tony and the boys.</i>

34:58.098 --> 35:00.976
<i>The bodies of three men
have been discovered in a Range Rover,</i>

35:01.185 --> 35:02.978
<i>on a farm in Rettendon in Essex.</i>

35:03.187 --> 35:06.690
<i>It's thought that these were victims
of a brutal gangland slaying.</i>

35:06.899 --> 35:08.984
<i>The police are not divulging 
much information at present,</i>

35:09.193 --> 35:11.862
<i>but we do know that all three men 
were gunned down</i>

35:11.987 --> 35:14.782
<i>somewhere between 6:00 p.m. and 12:00 p.m. 
last night.</i>

35:15.991 --> 35:19.286
<i>We hope to come back to this later 
in the bulletin.</i>

35:19.411 --> 35:23.582
<i>There were serious clashes between the prime minister
and the leader of the opposition...</i>

35:23.707 --> 35:25.459
- Hello, Paul. It's Carl.
<i>- Hello, Carl.</i>

35:25.584 --> 35:27.753
- Have you seen the news?
<i>- No, not yet. Why?</i>

35:28.003 --> 35:31.089
Can you pop around Emma's?
I've been trying to get ahold of them all morning.

35:31.214 --> 35:32.258
No one's answering. It's just engaged.

35:32.508 --> 35:33.968
<i>- What's going on?</i>
- Well, I don't know, mate.

35:34.301 --> 35:36.887
Just do me a favor.
Just go around there and give me a call.

35:37.096 --> 35:39.056
<i>- On me way.</i>
- All right, mate. Ta.

35:43.811 --> 35:45.688
This is giving me the fucking creeps, this is.

35:57.199 --> 35:58.951
Hello, mate.
It's me again. 

35:59.118 --> 36:00.953
Listen, mate, 
can you give me a call back, please?

36:01.203 --> 36:03.372
Well, I'm just getting a bit worried.

36:03.581 --> 36:06.876
So just give me a call back
as soon as you get this message.

36:07.084 --> 36:08.878
All right, mate. Ta.

36:10.796 --> 36:12.089
Hey.

36:15.509 --> 36:17.553
- Are you all right?
- No, I'm no all right.

36:17.803 --> 36:19.180
I can't get ahold of no cunt.

36:21.807 --> 36:23.767
Something's happened.

36:26.020 --> 36:28.189
Babe, you're scaring me.

36:28.314 --> 36:30.065
<i>Back to the murders in Rettendon.</i>

36:30.191 --> 36:34.069
<i>The police have announced that there will be 
a news conference later this evening,</i>

36:34.195 --> 36:36.780
<i>when it's expected that the names
of those murdered will be released.</i>

36:37.990 --> 36:39.575
<i>Carlton. Carl?</i>

36:39.783 --> 36:41.869
- Yeah, go on. What's happening?
<i>- Emma's fine.</i>

36:42.119 --> 36:44.371
<i>Tony didn't come back last night,
but she ain't worried.</i>

36:44.497 --> 36:46.290
<i>- Hold on, mate.</i>
- Paul?

36:46.499 --> 36:47.666
<i>Fucking hell, the Old Bill's just turned up.</i>

36:47.917 --> 36:49.251
<i>Emma!</i>

36:49.502 --> 36:52.254
- Paul, talk to me.
<i>- Emma!</i>

36:52.505 --> 36:55.549
<i>I'm gonna have to go.
I don't know what's going on down there.</i>

36:55.800 --> 36:58.052
<i>Everything's fine as far as I know, 
but not here.</i>

36:58.219 --> 37:00.679
<i>I'm gonna have to go.
Laters, mate.</i>

37:07.812 --> 37:09.480
<i>Police have tonight released the names</i>

37:09.605 --> 37:12.775
<i>of the three men murdered in Rettendon
on the night of the 6th of December.</i>

37:12.983 --> 37:15.486
<i>The victims were 38-year-old Anthony Tucker,</i>

37:15.694 --> 37:17.488
<i>37-year-old Patrick Tate,</i>

37:17.696 --> 37:19.573
<i>and 26-year-old Craig Rolfe.</i>

37:19.782 --> 37:23.077
<i>It's believed that all three men 
had gangland connections.</i>

37:23.285 --> 37:25.955
<i>When the police informed Tony's dad 
of his son's death,</i>

37:26.205 --> 37:29.458
<i>he dropped dead of a heart attack
right there in front of them.</i>

37:29.708 --> 37:31.961
<i>After the tears came the questions:</i>

37:32.211 --> 37:34.672
<i>Who murdered Tony, Pat and Craig that night?</i>

37:50.396 --> 37:53.566
- Evening, lads.
- Before you start, he wasn't speeding,

37:53.691 --> 37:56.569
the car's not stolen, 
the fucking tax disc is in date, all right?

37:56.819 --> 37:58.779
I've got some information
I'd like to share with you,

37:58.988 --> 38:02.158
ask you a few questions...
very informal.

38:02.199 --> 38:05.161
What, now? We're in kind of a hurry...
big family dinner.

38:05.411 --> 38:06.787
This won't take long,

38:06.912 --> 38:10.166
but it's dangerous out on these main roads
with this weather. Follow the car.

38:10.291 --> 38:12.668
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
We ain't got fucking do nothing for you.

38:12.918 --> 38:14.962
No, you don't, but I could always
get a search warrant,

38:15.087 --> 38:17.756
search the three of your houses tonight.
Really fuck your evenings up.

38:19.216 --> 38:20.551
You'll be on your way in 15 minutes.

38:20.718 --> 38:23.971
- No, Office...
- Shut up, shithead. Lead the way.

38:40.905 --> 38:42.364
Sorry about this, lads.

38:42.615 --> 38:43.949
Thanks for the cooperation.

38:44.200 --> 38:45.576
Yeah, blah, blah, fucking blah.

38:45.701 --> 38:47.870
What's so fucking important
that you had to speak to us tonight?

38:48.120 --> 38:49.580
Trust me, you'll like this.

38:49.788 --> 38:51.373
Why'd you have to fucking bring us
all the way down here for?

38:51.582 --> 38:53.083
The traffic... it's dangerous.

38:53.209 --> 38:54.877
Oi. You on fucking drugs?

38:56.086 --> 38:57.254
You got any?

39:16.190 --> 39:20.277
<i>The way we saw it,
the police had stronger motives than anyone.</i>

39:20.402 --> 39:22.655
<i>The rumor was we were all under observation,</i>

39:22.905 --> 39:25.658
<i>so how the fuck could a hit go down 
right under their nose?</i>

39:25.783 --> 39:29.370
<i>It could have been revenge
for several high-profile Ecstasy deaths,</i>

39:29.620 --> 39:31.455
<i>or it could've been they were just getting rid</i>

39:31.705 --> 39:33.874
<i>of three of the most dangerous drug dealers 
from the southeast.</i>

39:34.083 --> 39:36.460
<i>Either way, it was a paranoid first few days,</i>

39:36.585 --> 39:39.255
<i>for anyone who knew the three was a suspect.</i>

39:39.380 --> 39:42.258
<i>Over the next few days,
silence fell on gangland</i>

39:42.508 --> 39:43.968
<i>as hundreds of people were questioned.</i>

39:44.218 --> 39:46.762
<i>One theory was gaining in credibility.</i>

39:47.012 --> 39:49.473
<i>Two names just kept coming up.</i>

39:55.980 --> 39:57.690
- Fucking hell.
- Put your hands on the fucking dash!

39:57.898 --> 39:59.275
Whoa!
What's this about?

39:59.608 --> 40:01.277
The brothers want a word with you, Pat.

40:01.485 --> 40:03.070
- Tell your bloke to follow that car.
- I ain't going...

40:03.320 --> 40:05.781
Makes no difference whether you drive or I drive.

40:05.990 --> 40:08.784
- Do you get the picture?
- It's a pretty fucking gory picture at that.

40:28.721 --> 40:30.890
You boys have become a fucking nuisance.

40:31.098 --> 40:32.975
We heard about your little fit down
at the pizza parlor, Pat.

40:33.184 --> 40:34.477
We spunked in our pants.

40:34.810 --> 40:36.479
Then we remembered how much fucking money 
you owe us.

40:36.687 --> 40:38.981
Listen. 
I'm trying to get all your dough back now.

40:39.106 --> 40:41.984
Whatever problem you've got with Pat
has got fuck-all to do with me.

40:42.109 --> 40:44.069
Fuck off, Tucker.
It's got everything to do with you.

40:44.403 --> 40:46.780
You're all involved.
All fucking out of control,

40:46.906 --> 40:48.491
ripping off every cunt from here to Hounslow.

40:48.699 --> 40:50.951
Well, it stops tonight.
Shoot that cunt.

40:51.118 --> 40:53.370
Please don't shoot me.

40:53.496 --> 40:55.164
Come on, take it like a man, son.

40:55.289 --> 40:57.082
Ain't that bad.
All be over in a moment.

41:00.711 --> 41:03.672
- Fuck you, you fucking cunt!
- You next, Tucker.

41:05.299 --> 41:08.552
<i>But these were just paranoid theories
being handed out left, right and center.</i>

41:08.803 --> 41:12.890
<i>The newspapers started printing any old shit
from small-time crooks and wannabes.</i>

41:13.098 --> 41:15.851
<i>Apparently half of Essex was an expert on the subject.</i>

41:16.101 --> 41:18.062
And what's this then?

41:20.189 --> 41:21.274
I have a lot of young lads... 

41:21.483 --> 41:25.486
<i>Six months later Darren Nicholls was nicked
with 10 kilos of puff in his boot.</i>

41:25.611 --> 41:27.488
<i>Before anyone thought much about it,</i>

41:27.613 --> 41:30.783
<i>he was busy grassing to the Old Bill 
about the triple murders.</i>

41:32.201 --> 41:36.288
<i>Walk away, walk away</i>

41:36.413 --> 41:38.290
<i>Walk away now</i>

41:38.499 --> 41:42.461
<i>Walk away, walk away</i>

41:42.586 --> 41:46.465
<i>Walk away now...</i>

41:49.218 --> 41:51.053
Mickey Steel has fucked up everything.

41:51.220 --> 41:53.556
I've spent years sweetening up
these fucking contacts.

41:53.806 --> 41:56.976
He's made me look like a right mug
and us look like we don't know what we're doing.

41:57.101 --> 41:58.561
I've told everyone I know
what a fucking cunt he is. 

41:58.894 --> 42:00.688
Okay, shut the fuck up.

42:00.896 --> 42:02.273
He's heading towards our table right now.

42:07.403 --> 42:09.780
Tony, Pat, how's it going?

42:09.989 --> 42:12.783
So what have you got to tell us
that's so fucking important?

42:12.908 --> 42:15.369
I've got something coming up...

42:15.494 --> 42:16.079
something big...

42:16.413 --> 42:20.291
so big it's gonna make that last deal 
look like pocket money by comparison.

42:20.416 --> 42:24.879
Yeah? I hope by that you mean pocket money
and not pocketing our fucking money.

42:27.298 --> 42:29.758
- What's happening, chaps?
- Sit down, shut your mouth and listen.

42:35.014 --> 42:37.850
I've been hired by this Dutch firm to do a job,

42:38.100 --> 42:41.687
a job that involves my plane
and a shitload of white.

42:41.687 --> 42:43.689
How much?

42:43.898 --> 42:47.359
I'm meant to be bringing over 
30 kilos of Columbian pure,

42:47.610 --> 42:49.487
land my plane in a field near Rettendon.

42:49.695 --> 42:51.572
30 fucking kilos?

42:51.780 --> 42:54.158
- How much is that worth?
- It depends on the quality.

42:54.408 --> 42:57.661
It's the bollocks. 
They've already paid me Â£50,000 up front.

42:57.703 --> 42:59.788
The drugs are standing by in Holland.

42:59.997 --> 43:00.090
They're all set to go.

43:00.099 --> 43:03.667
I'm meant to be bringing it over in the next few days
when the weather improves.

43:04.001 --> 43:06.754
- So what's the plan, mate?
- Do what you two do best...

43:06.921 --> 43:08.589
rob the cunts.

43:08.714 --> 43:11.759
I'll tell you where and when
I'll be landing the plane.

43:12.009 --> 43:13.260
There'll be two others on board with me.

43:13.511 --> 43:15.262
You steam in really strong,

43:15.596 --> 43:16.889
stick guns in our faces...

43:17.097 --> 43:19.475
bish bash... pinch the gear.

43:19.683 --> 43:20.976
Simple as that.
What do you reckon?

43:21.185 --> 43:22.686
Well, I won't kid you...
if that gear is proper,

43:22.895 --> 43:24.188
we've got to be talking about Â£100 mill.

43:24.480 --> 43:27.358
- Exactly.
- So what do you want out of it?

43:27.483 --> 43:29.068
Bust it up three ways.

43:29.401 --> 43:31.570
A third? 
You're having a fucking laugh, ain't you?

43:31.695 --> 43:33.489
That's fine.
That's a fair deal.

43:33.697 --> 43:37.660
<i>And did you think that I'd stay</i>

43:37.701 --> 43:39.787
<i>In your destructive life?</i>

43:39.995 --> 43:43.290
<i>And did you think I'd be okay</i>

43:43.499 --> 43:45.876
<i>And someday be your wife?</i>

43:46.001 --> 43:49.755
<i>And if I'm here, I live in fear</i>

43:50.005 --> 43:51.966
<i>Why'd you go so far?</i>

43:52.216 --> 43:54.385
<i>You can see that it's me...</i>

43:54.593 --> 43:56.262
We'll have to make this look convincing though.

43:56.387 --> 43:58.180
They can't know you're in on it, Mickey.

43:58.305 --> 44:00.850
We'll have to fuck you up a bit,
maybe knock a few teeth out.

44:01.100 --> 44:03.978
I can handle a couple of broken teeth 
for 10 kilos.

44:04.186 --> 44:05.855
This is the big time, Carl.

44:05.980 --> 44:08.482
We're talking numbers
with shitloads of zeros on the end.

44:08.691 --> 44:10.151
You're talking like it's already in the bag.

44:10.401 --> 44:12.069
Mickey's assured us it's all going ahead.

44:12.194 --> 44:14.655
- He's already been paid.
- Yeah, he's been paid, you ain't.

44:14.905 --> 44:17.658
- Trust me, it's on.
- Just be careful, will you?

44:17.908 --> 44:21.078
Pat's running around the whole of fucking Essex 
shouting his mouth off,

44:21.203 --> 44:22.872
and if this gets back to you, you're fucked.

44:23.289 --> 44:25.082
Relax, mate.

44:25.291 --> 44:28.169
You worry too much.
It's all good.

44:29.295 --> 44:30.963
I want to tell you something, Carl.

44:31.088 --> 44:32.882
I'm surrounded by a lot of people,

44:33.007 --> 44:34.675
but I know they just want a piece of me.

44:34.884 --> 44:37.553
With you it's different.

44:37.720 --> 44:39.555
You just want to be my friend.

44:39.805 --> 44:42.975
You know, you're the only one I fully trust.

44:43.184 --> 44:46.187
- Same.
- I want to do something for you.

44:46.395 --> 44:48.856
I'm gonna give you Â£30,000 out of this.

44:48.981 --> 44:50.858
Don't be silly.
You don't owe me nothing.

44:51.192 --> 44:54.652
I know, mate. I also know you'd do the same for me 
if you had a deal like this going down.

44:54.694 --> 44:56.489
Yeah, of course. You know that.

44:56.697 --> 44:58.282
I'm gonna give you money for two reasons, Carlton.

44:58.407 --> 45:01.076
Firstly, you're broke.

45:02.703 --> 45:04.079
All right.
What's the other reason?

45:04.205 --> 45:06.582
You never asked me for a fucking thing.

45:10.920 --> 45:12.671
Things are gonna quiet down a lot in the new year.

45:12.880 --> 45:16.050
When this deal goes down,
I'm going into semiretirement.

45:16.300 --> 45:18.761
Do you know what?

45:19.011 --> 45:21.680
That's not such a bad idea.

45:24.183 --> 45:26.560
I'm gonna slip off, all right?

45:26.811 --> 45:29.772
I promised Denny I'd have a family dinner tonight.

45:29.980 --> 45:31.857
- Sounds good, mate.
- Yeah.

45:31.982 --> 45:33.859
Yeah, I just fancy a quiet one for a change.

45:36.487 --> 45:39.073
- And thanks.
- No worries, mate.

45:39.281 --> 45:43.077
- All right.
- Love you. See you, mate.

45:57.800 --> 45:59.051
- Hello?
<i>- Hey, Darren.</i>

45:59.301 --> 46:01.053
<i>What are you up to this evening?</i>

46:01.220 --> 46:03.973
- Why? What's up?
<i>- Me and Jack need a favor.</i>

46:04.098 --> 46:07.476
<i>Tony, it's Pat. 
I just got off the phone with our pal Mickey.</i>

46:07.685 --> 46:10.354
<i>- Are we on for it?
- No, too much fucking snow on the ground,</i>

46:10.479 --> 46:12.273
<i>but he reckons we're on
for the day after tomorrow.</i>

46:12.606 --> 46:14.650
<i>- I can't fucking wait.</i>
- Tony, listen up.

46:14.900 --> 46:17.653
Mickey wants to show us exactly
where he wants to land his plane.

46:17.695 --> 46:20.281
So are you and Rolfe up for a little meet later?

46:23.409 --> 46:24.952
It's cold, isn't it?

46:25.202 --> 46:27.288
You should've put a coat on then.

46:27.413 --> 46:31.750
Well, I didn't realize the plan was
to sit in the motor and freeze to fucking death.

46:32.001 --> 46:34.879
The plan is we wait for Pat to turn up,

46:35.004 --> 46:37.381
then we drive to where Mickey 
is landing the plane.

46:40.217 --> 46:41.969
Tell me why again.

46:42.219 --> 46:44.555
Mickey wants you there in the background,

46:44.805 --> 46:46.765
just to make sure everything's all right.

46:46.891 --> 46:48.976
Pat's been unpredictable lately,

46:49.185 --> 46:51.687
in case you haven't fucking noticed.

46:54.315 --> 46:56.775
<i>Listen. I've been doing a lot of thinking 
about all this.</i>

46:56.901 --> 47:00.279
Why don't we fucking nick all the gear
and do Mickey with the others?

47:00.488 --> 47:01.989
I thought he was your pal.

47:02.198 --> 47:04.158
That was before he fucked us over, monkey boy.

47:04.408 --> 47:07.369
I got no fucking loyalty to that cunt no more.

47:07.620 --> 47:09.872
He's the only one
who can link us to this fucking robbery.

47:10.080 --> 47:11.665
I'm game.

47:29.683 --> 47:31.060
Okay, let's go.

47:45.699 --> 47:48.369
Right. 
Drive down the road about half a mile.

47:48.410 --> 47:50.454
You sit tight and wait for my call.

47:50.704 --> 47:53.582
- Where's your phone?
- It's in me pocket.

47:53.791 --> 47:55.751
You won't hear the fucking thing ring in there, 
will you?

47:56.001 --> 47:57.461
Put it on the dashboard.

48:05.803 --> 48:07.972
I ain't gotta ask you 
if that thing is turned on, have I?

48:08.097 --> 48:10.057
Of course it's turned on.
What do you think I am?

48:10.307 --> 48:11.976
Are you sure?

48:18.607 --> 48:19.984
I thought it was on.

48:20.317 --> 48:21.986
Darren, I'm fucking speechless.

48:22.194 --> 48:24.155
I don't know why Mickey puts up with you.

48:24.280 --> 48:26.866
You're a useless cunt.

48:27.116 --> 48:29.160
- Fat cunt.
- What?

48:29.285 --> 48:31.954
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

48:32.204 --> 48:34.456
And don't go playing that fucking radio either.

48:34.707 --> 48:36.750
It's vital you hear that phone ring.

48:38.711 --> 48:39.879
Can I stick the tape on?

48:40.087 --> 48:43.257
Tape deck, radio...
what is the fucking difference?

48:43.507 --> 48:45.676
What's the long-range forecast 
looking like, mate?

48:45.885 --> 48:48.888
Well, the weather seems to be improving at last,

48:48.888 --> 48:51.557
so I reckon we'll be up for it
in the next couple of days.

48:51.807 --> 48:53.976
- 48 hours.
- Uh-huh.

48:54.185 --> 48:57.855
48 fucking hours
and then our lives are changing!

48:57.980 --> 49:00.858
Craig, you're gonna have 
to chuck a left up here, all right?

49:00.983 --> 49:05.070
Mick... I've got to say it, son...
I fucking love you.

49:05.196 --> 49:06.572
No, I swear, I fucking love you.

49:09.116 --> 49:11.160
You know, that's not 
what I've been hearing around town, Patrick.

49:11.410 --> 49:13.579
Well, forget all that fucking bollocks now,

49:13.787 --> 49:14.663
'cause we're going to hit the big time.

49:14.788 --> 49:16.457
We are gonna be fucking caked.

49:20.211 --> 49:21.962
Left up here, is it, Mick?

49:22.213 --> 49:23.589
Yeah, that's right, Craig... a left.

49:37.603 --> 49:38.979
Hello?

49:40.314 --> 49:41.774
Hello, babe.

49:43.984 --> 49:45.986
No. Of course I miss you.

49:48.113 --> 49:50.866
You are such a lovely girl
and I don't fucking deserve you.

49:51.116 --> 49:52.952
You know that. Do me a favor,

49:53.202 --> 49:54.662
give me a bell back later.
I'm with some people.

49:56.080 --> 49:57.164
What?

49:58.707 --> 50:00.376
No, I'm just with Tony and the boys.

50:00.709 --> 50:02.378
Yeah.

50:02.586 --> 50:04.255
Listen. Of course I do.

50:05.589 --> 50:07.883
I love you.
Is that good enough?

50:08.008 --> 50:09.176
I love you.

50:09.510 --> 50:10.886
Call me later. Bye.

50:15.015 --> 50:16.475
There's a gate up ahead, Mick.

50:16.809 --> 50:18.060
Do you want me to open it?

50:18.185 --> 50:20.771
No, it's okay, son.
I'll get it.

50:39.790 --> 50:42.084
- Shut up, Pat.
- No, please!

50:44.211 --> 50:46.464
Mickey! Please, no!

50:54.013 --> 50:55.890
Mate... please, mate.

50:56.098 --> 50:57.558
Please, we're mates.

50:57.808 --> 51:01.061
We've worked far too hard 
to let a cunt like you fuck everything up.

51:01.312 --> 51:03.689
You take it. Take it all.

51:03.689 --> 51:07.651
What? The 30 kilos of Columbian pure?

51:07.902 --> 51:09.653
You soppy cunt.

51:09.904 --> 51:12.156
You soppy, greedy, gullible cunt.

51:15.993 --> 51:17.369
I'm out, Jack.

51:53.697 --> 51:56.283
- Yup?
<i>- Come and get us.</i>

51:56.492 --> 51:58.786
That didn't take long.

52:14.009 --> 52:15.678
Pat squealed like a pig.

52:15.886 --> 52:17.680
Let's fuck off.

52:37.700 --> 52:39.368
Where's Mick?

52:39.618 --> 52:40.870
He's coming.

52:53.799 --> 52:55.968
Turn that fucking light out now.

52:59.805 --> 53:01.557
All right, Darren.
Let's go.

53:07.396 --> 53:10.357
<i>This was Darren Nicholl's testimony 
of what happened.</i>

53:10.608 --> 53:13.569
<i>The only people who really know 
are in the ground.</i>

53:13.819 --> 53:19.658
<i>It may be that the shooting has occurred
over higher drug dealers</i>

53:19.909 --> 53:22.369
<i>trying to find a greater position of power.</i>

53:44.391 --> 53:46.560
Daddy!

53:48.521 --> 53:51.857
<i>Heaven knows what life may bring</i>

53:53.484 --> 53:57.488
<i>There could be blue skies through the rain</i>

53:58.781 --> 54:02.952
<i>And I know I must find my way...</i>

54:02.993 --> 54:04.954
- Don't listen to him, baby.
- <i>Come on, help me</i>

54:05.204 --> 54:07.957
<i>Release my soul today</i>

54:08.207 --> 54:13.254
<i>Won't you help me,
help me through this pain?</i>

54:13.420 --> 54:15.756
<i>It cuts like a knife</i>

54:15.881 --> 54:18.467
<i>Burns like acid rain</i>

54:18.592 --> 54:20.177
<i>Come on, help me</i>

54:20.386 --> 54:23.681
<i>Help me release my soul</i>

54:23.806 --> 54:26.851
<i>But nobody knows which way</i>

54:27.101 --> 54:29.061
<i>Or which road to go</i>

54:29.186 --> 54:33.691
<i>Heaven knows what life may bring</i>

54:35.109 --> 54:38.154
<i>Never feel it till you feel the acid sting</i>

54:39.488 --> 54:43.576
<i>Help me to release my soul today</i>

54:43.701 --> 54:46.871
<i>Help me, help me</i>

54:47.121 --> 54:49.582
<i>Help me, Lord, Lord</i>

54:52.209 --> 54:54.378
<i>Help me, Lord, Lord...</i>

54:59.091 --> 55:00.885
<i>There's not a lot of old men in my game.</i>

55:01.093 --> 55:03.387
<i>Paranoia is what keeps me alive.</i>

55:03.512 --> 55:05.389
<i>I'm taking no chances.</i>

55:05.681 --> 55:07.558
<i>Every room in my house is armed.</i>

55:07.808 --> 55:11.562
<i>You break in and I'll bathe 
in your fucking blood.</i>

55:11.604 --> 55:14.982
<i>And if one day my time is up
let me say to you:</i>

55:15.191 --> 55:19.487
<i>If you think I'm just gonna sit
and beg for my life...</i>

55:19.695 --> 55:22.072
<i>well, then you're some sort of cunt.</i>

55:22.114 --> 55:25.576
<i>Heaven knows what life may bring</i>

55:27.119 --> 55:31.791
<i>There could be blue skies through the rain</i>

55:31.916 --> 55:36.670
<i>And I know I must find my way...</i>

55:36.796 --> 55:38.464
<i>So come on, help me</i>

55:38.589 --> 55:41.467
<i>To release my soul today</i>

55:41.717 --> 55:46.555
<i>Won't you help me,
help me through this pain?</i>

55:46.680 --> 55:47.890
<i>It cuts like a knife</i>

55:49.016 --> 55:51.852
<i>It feels like acid rain</i>

55:52.019 --> 55:54.688
<i>Help me, help me</i>

55:54.814 --> 55:56.982
<i>To release my soul</i>

55:57.107 --> 56:00.361
<i>But nobody knows which way</i>

56:00.611 --> 56:02.655
<i>Or which road to go</i>

56:02.905 --> 56:08.077
<i>Heaven knows what life may bring</i>

56:08.118 --> 56:12.373
<i>Never feel it till you feel the acid sting</i>

56:12.414 --> 56:17.086
<i>Help me to release my soul today</i>

56:17.211 --> 56:20.464
<i>Help me, help me</i>

56:20.506 --> 56:22.758
<i>Help me, Lord, Lord</i>

56:25.302 --> 56:27.888
<i>Help me, Lord, Lord</i>

56:30.808 --> 56:32.977
<i>Help me, Lord, Lord.</i>

58:03.984 --> 58:08.072
<i>Hold on, hear what I say</i>

58:08.197 --> 58:10.574
<i>Is a man on a mission</i>

58:10.783 --> 58:13.160
<i>Just a man in a cage?</i>

58:13.410 --> 58:16.664
<i>If we can hold on</i>

58:16.789 --> 58:19.250
<i>To what we believe</i>

58:19.500 --> 58:21.961
<i>All stick together</i>

58:22.211 --> 58:24.755
<i>Be there for each other</i>

58:25.005 --> 58:26.674
<i>Hold on</i>

58:48.404 --> 58:52.658
<i>Hold on, hear what I say</i>

58:52.783 --> 58:55.369
<i>Is a man on a mission</i>

58:55.494 --> 58:58.080
<i>Just a man in a cage?</i>

58:58.289 --> 59:01.250
<i>If we can hold on</i>

59:01.417 --> 59:03.878
<i>To what we believe</i>

59:04.086 --> 59:06.672
<i>All stick together</i>

59:06.881 --> 59:09.383
<i>Be there for each other</i>

59:09.800 --> 59:11.469
<i>Hold on.</i>
