00:33.896 --> 00:37.464
There's no easy way to say this, Wesley.
I'm just gonna come out with it.

00:37.466 --> 00:39.569
I think that's best.

00:43.873 --> 00:46.406
Your mother and I
have considered

00:46.408 --> 00:49.842
all of the possibilities
available to us,

00:49.844 --> 00:54.882
um, vis-Ã -vis our
relationship difficulties.

00:54.884 --> 00:59.452
And... And in the current
emotional climate, we feel...

00:59.454 --> 01:02.292
Clay, can you just
get on with it?

01:03.192 --> 01:04.527
Right.

01:06.460 --> 01:08.497
Mommy and Daddy
are splitting up, pal.

01:11.033 --> 01:12.299
Hey.

01:12.301 --> 01:13.933
Hey. That's what
I don't want.

01:13.935 --> 01:17.637
I don't want you blaming yourself.
It has nothing to do with you.

01:17.639 --> 01:23.177
Wesley, I know that you are
so tired of hearing us argue,

01:23.179 --> 01:27.448
and that is why this
is the right thing for us to do.

01:27.450 --> 01:30.216
Yeah. We both
love you very much.

01:30.218 --> 01:34.288
I mean, you're still the
biggest star in Daddy's sky.

01:34.290 --> 01:36.659
Yeah.

01:38.694 --> 01:40.862
I'm not sure
we got through to him.

01:42.798 --> 01:44.330
He's a guy.

01:44.332 --> 01:47.069
We have our own way
of processing emotion.

03:41.050 --> 03:44.751
I've seen some sad sack
waste of space in my life,

03:44.753 --> 03:46.352
but that scrimmage
I just witnessed

03:46.354 --> 03:49.121
was the worst thing I've
ever seen in my whole life.

03:49.123 --> 03:51.691
You need to pull your heads
out of your rectums

03:51.693 --> 03:53.626
and start playing hockey
like you mean it.

03:53.628 --> 03:55.362
You are the Wolf Pack,

03:55.364 --> 03:59.866
not the help-a-granny-across-
the-street pack of boys on a hockey...

03:59.868 --> 04:02.469
That didn't make sense,
but do "hard work" on three. Ready?

04:02.471 --> 04:05.873
- "Hard work" on three. One, two, three!
- Hard work!

04:05.875 --> 04:08.074
Wor... All right, game face.
Ready?

04:09.912 --> 04:12.179
That was terrifying,
and not in a good way.

04:12.181 --> 04:14.917
- Work on it for tomorrow.
- All right, guys, good practice.

04:20.389 --> 04:24.056
So it's really over, huh?
Like a hundred percent done?

04:24.058 --> 04:27.096
Ice has been thin for a while, man.
It finally broke.

04:28.462 --> 04:32.131
Do you mind if I pursue Olive then?
Like, romantically?

04:32.133 --> 04:34.802
Could you pursue her if
both your legs were broken?

04:34.804 --> 04:37.273
Off-limits?
Glad we established that boundary.

04:40.074 --> 04:42.911
How are you feeling on this, man?
Breakup? Let's talk about it.

04:44.646 --> 04:49.285
Uh, it's a sign
from the ice hockey gods.

04:53.321 --> 04:57.558
You know what it is? It's a wake-up
call I need, man, to start this year.

04:57.560 --> 05:00.094
- That's a good way to look at it.
- Uh-huh.

05:00.096 --> 05:04.331
I was worried that losing someone like
Olive would absolutely shatter you.

05:04.333 --> 05:07.233
Like, I thought you were
gonna be a mess, you know?

05:07.235 --> 05:10.171
I'm glad your cup is half
full on this one, you know?

05:13.242 --> 05:14.406
Yeah.

05:14.408 --> 05:16.776
Where you at
on the grief scale?

05:16.778 --> 05:19.745
Stage two. Anger.
I want to kill him.

05:19.747 --> 05:21.447
Oh, rash, but exciting.

05:21.449 --> 05:26.387
He just blindsided me. I mean,
I guess it was creeping along for a while.

05:26.389 --> 05:28.454
Are my expectations off?
Is it me?

05:28.456 --> 05:31.159
- Oh, don't be ridiculous.
- We had a plan.

05:31.894 --> 05:34.163
It was such a good plan.

05:35.197 --> 05:37.231
Wesley and I will
be fine without him.

05:37.233 --> 05:40.336
- Help me intubate this guy in four.
- Okay.

05:41.704 --> 05:43.536
<i>Nightmare on Elm Street.</i>
Mine.

05:43.538 --> 05:45.471
<i>Get Smart.</i>
You need that.

05:45.473 --> 05:47.406
<i>The Departed.</i>
That's appropriate.

05:47.408 --> 05:48.909
<i>Lethal Weapon.</i>
Yes, I am.

05:48.911 --> 05:50.877
- <i>It's a Wonderful Life.</i>
- Uh, mine.

05:50.879 --> 05:52.646
- It stays here.
- No argument.

05:52.648 --> 05:53.983
<i>E.T.</i> Mine.

05:54.882 --> 05:56.651
Oh, <i>Flashdance.</i>

05:59.120 --> 06:00.622
What about these?

06:07.428 --> 06:08.930
Good times.

06:09.730 --> 06:11.867
I look good as a blond.

06:13.369 --> 06:14.901
I'll make you copies.

06:14.903 --> 06:17.606
Yeah, that'd be nice.

06:22.476 --> 06:25.644
Well, this is it for now.

06:25.646 --> 06:28.850
Well, I guess I might come back
later in case I forgot something.

06:29.951 --> 06:32.687
You're still wearing
your ring.

06:38.225 --> 06:43.031
Um, I'm sorry this
didn't work out. Us.

06:44.733 --> 06:46.668
Yeah, me too.

06:53.641 --> 06:54.707
Wes!

06:54.709 --> 06:57.743
- Come on!
- Excuse me?

06:57.745 --> 06:59.312
Let's hit the road, buddy.

06:59.314 --> 07:02.781
You think
you're taking Wesley?

07:02.783 --> 07:06.152
Wait. You think
Wesley's staying here?

07:06.154 --> 07:08.120
Well, this is
where he lives.

07:08.122 --> 07:11.558
- I don't know where else he would go.
- Into the woods with his dad.

07:11.560 --> 07:13.926
That's where
you're gonna live?

07:13.928 --> 07:16.962
In that serial killer shack
by the lake?

07:16.964 --> 07:19.865
Don't you listen to her, Wes.

07:19.867 --> 07:23.603
It's a very spacious,
prefabricated mobile domicile.

07:23.605 --> 07:28.007
So, what happens
when you have practice

07:28.009 --> 07:30.543
or a game or, you know...

07:30.545 --> 07:33.413
- I will take him with.
- Uh-huh.

07:33.415 --> 07:35.714
- Coach lets me get away with anything.
- Huh.

07:35.716 --> 07:37.449
Perks of being a veteran.

07:37.451 --> 07:41.723
You haven't put a second of
thought into this, have you?

07:43.225 --> 07:45.027
A few, actually.

07:45.661 --> 07:47.392
You're never home,

07:47.394 --> 07:51.731
and I'm not letting my little
butter bones become a latch-key dog.

07:51.733 --> 07:54.534
I will figure
something out.

07:54.536 --> 07:56.271
- Hmm. Unacceptable.
- Yeah.

07:57.338 --> 07:58.971
That is not happening.

07:58.973 --> 08:03.110
I'm perfectly capable of looking after
Wesley James Lonnergan on my own.

08:03.112 --> 08:05.478
- Come on, big fella.
- No. You're not taking him.

08:05.480 --> 08:06.647
Get your little...

08:09.918 --> 08:12.388
Let's let Wesley decide.

08:18.560 --> 08:20.728
- I'm ready.
- You're going down, woman.

08:20.730 --> 08:23.096
I've got an enema in an hour.
Not mine.

08:23.098 --> 08:25.264
- So could we just do this already?
- I'm ready.

08:25.266 --> 08:27.634
Let me get a picture
with his two leashes

08:27.636 --> 08:30.002
for his various
social media pages.

08:30.004 --> 08:31.937
All right,
on the count of three,

08:31.939 --> 08:33.972
I want you to release
your leashes,

08:33.975 --> 08:36.946
and whoever he goes to
gets to keep him.

08:40.714 --> 08:43.416
All right, it's okay.
One, two...

08:43.418 --> 08:46.118
If you go to your dad,
I'll give you so much bacon.

08:46.120 --> 08:47.420
- Hurry!
- Three!

08:47.422 --> 08:50.123
Hey, sweetie! Come on.
Mommy loves you!

08:50.125 --> 08:52.024
We'll give her a chance.

08:52.026 --> 08:53.493
- Come here, baby.
- Wesley.

08:53.495 --> 08:55.962
No, no, no, no, no, no!

08:55.964 --> 08:58.065
You've been a good boy!

08:58.067 --> 08:59.932
Wesley,
don't listen to him!

08:59.934 --> 09:03.402
Who's the best little dog?
You're the best little...

09:03.404 --> 09:06.272
Who's the best little doggy?
You're the best little doggy.

09:06.274 --> 09:08.242
Oh.

09:08.244 --> 09:10.042
No, Wesley, come back.

09:10.044 --> 09:12.712
Are we gonna
do this all day?

09:12.714 --> 09:15.084
Come on.

09:16.551 --> 09:19.051
Wanna tussle with Daddy?
Wanna tussle with Daddy?

09:19.053 --> 09:20.753
Oh, yeah, that's right.

09:20.755 --> 09:23.890
Help! Wesley, help!

09:23.892 --> 09:26.395
I like that. I like that.

09:29.130 --> 09:31.498
Wesley, save me!
Save me!

09:31.500 --> 09:33.166
I'm dying, Wesley. Help!

09:35.203 --> 09:37.237
Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah?

09:37.239 --> 09:39.171
- Oh, no. Oh, no.
- Wesley!

09:39.173 --> 09:41.141
Wesley, no! Come on! Come back!

09:41.143 --> 09:43.576
- Yep. See ya.
- Wesley, come on!

09:43.578 --> 09:46.879
- Well, this is a perfectly good waste of a Saturday.
- Great.

09:46.881 --> 09:49.184
- Yup...
- Wesley!

09:51.820 --> 09:53.686
Wesley!

09:53.688 --> 09:55.589
Okay, guys.
Easy. Easy.

09:57.493 --> 09:58.958
Good.

09:58.960 --> 10:02.395
- Sit!
- Wesley, please!

10:02.397 --> 10:03.362
- Wesley!
- Sorry.

10:03.364 --> 10:05.831
- Who's the owner?
- CLAY, OLIVE: I am!

10:05.833 --> 10:07.800
That's me.

10:07.802 --> 10:09.736
How did you...

10:09.738 --> 10:11.571
Never unleash
an untrained animal.

10:11.573 --> 10:14.373
- Oh.
- We-We-We would never usually do that.

10:14.375 --> 10:16.408
- No.
- But anyway, thank you.

10:16.410 --> 10:19.445
What were you doing, Wesley?
What were you doing?

10:19.447 --> 10:21.948
By the way,
can you teach me that whistle thing?

10:21.950 --> 10:23.252
There's
no trick to it.

10:24.419 --> 10:27.087
What's your name, miss?

10:27.089 --> 10:28.954
Oh. Olive Greene.

10:28.956 --> 10:31.156
- Glenn Hannon.
- Nice to meet you.

10:31.158 --> 10:33.560
I run a rehabilitation
and training center.

10:33.562 --> 10:36.728
Clay Lonnergan,
from the Wolves, you know?

10:36.730 --> 10:38.297
Huh.

10:38.299 --> 10:39.934
If you, uh...

10:41.436 --> 10:43.903
If you ever want to improve
Wesley's off-leash obedience...

10:43.905 --> 10:45.240
Yeah?

10:49.144 --> 10:51.880
- Come on down.
- Great. Thank you.

10:52.548 --> 10:53.615
Yeah.

10:56.051 --> 10:58.451
- All right, guys.
- Is it...

10:58.453 --> 10:59.387
Two hands.

11:02.724 --> 11:04.791
What are you doing?

11:04.793 --> 11:07.392
Well, you won't
let me leave with Wes,

11:07.394 --> 11:09.595
and I'm not leaving
without him.

11:09.597 --> 11:12.100
You can't
stay here, Clay.

11:13.601 --> 11:14.970
Okay.

11:17.272 --> 11:19.506
Oh! I didn't spill a drop.

11:19.508 --> 11:20.607
I'm serious.

11:20.609 --> 11:23.910
Life's too important
to be taken seriously.

11:25.580 --> 11:29.581
You know that he is better off with me.
I know that you know that.

11:29.583 --> 11:33.820
I know that you know that he
knows it's my place or no place.

11:33.822 --> 11:36.222
Look, buddy, I... I'm trying,

11:36.224 --> 11:38.757
but she's just not
respecting your wishes.

11:38.759 --> 11:41.026
Get out! Out!

11:41.028 --> 11:43.696
Do I have time for a nap?

11:43.698 --> 11:45.198
Maybe a quick massage?

11:45.200 --> 11:46.898
All right, you, out!
Come on!

11:46.900 --> 11:48.634
- Get... Get up!
- Is this a massage?

11:48.636 --> 11:51.938
- Get...
- What are we doing right now?

11:51.940 --> 11:53.676
Oh, Mommy.

11:54.875 --> 11:56.477
Come on!

11:57.611 --> 11:59.280
Oh, that feels good.

12:00.548 --> 12:02.717
This isn't funny, Clay!

12:06.654 --> 12:09.088
Oh-ho-ho!

12:09.090 --> 12:12.528
All right,
you want nasty Olive?

12:13.461 --> 12:14.594
Sure.

12:14.596 --> 12:16.532
I'll go get her.

12:19.500 --> 12:21.135
Don't forget
the handcuffs, honey.

12:25.173 --> 12:27.640
You're gonna come with Daddy
for a little bit.

12:27.642 --> 12:29.276
Yes. Police.

12:29.278 --> 12:31.076
I would like
to report an intruder.

12:31.078 --> 12:33.445
- His name is...
- Let's go.

12:33.447 --> 12:35.149
Clay!

12:35.951 --> 12:37.485
Clay!

12:39.855 --> 12:41.488
Clay!

12:41.490 --> 12:43.256
Wait, wait, wait.

12:43.258 --> 12:45.561
- Clay?
- Good boy!

12:46.193 --> 12:48.029
You can't do this.

12:50.030 --> 12:52.500
You're not serious!

13:04.346 --> 13:06.978
- You're crossing a line here, Clay.
- I can't hear you.

13:06.980 --> 13:11.117
If you don't turn around right now...
Don't make me hate you, Clay.

13:11.119 --> 13:12.417
Say bye-bye to Mommy.

13:12.419 --> 13:14.088
No, no, no, no.

13:20.895 --> 13:22.430
Oh, it's on.

13:33.442 --> 13:37.310
Next case on the docket,
we have <i>Greene v. Lonnergan.</i>

13:37.312 --> 13:40.012
The outstanding
issue of contention

13:40.014 --> 13:42.283
is the custody
arrangements for...

13:43.618 --> 13:45.252
a mixed breed dog?

13:46.687 --> 13:49.388
And joint custody
is not an option?

13:49.390 --> 13:52.425
Very much not so,
Your Honor.

13:52.427 --> 13:54.292
The microphone
does not work.

13:54.294 --> 13:58.129
Mr. Lonnergan,
you claim that yours is the only name

13:58.131 --> 13:59.999
on the pet adoption
certificate?

14:00.001 --> 14:03.802
Uh, yes.
That is certifiable.

14:03.804 --> 14:05.073
May I see
the document?

14:06.207 --> 14:08.141
No, Your Honor.

14:08.143 --> 14:09.743
I'm sorry?

14:09.745 --> 14:13.445
It would be really great if you
could just take my word for it.

14:13.447 --> 14:16.949
Do you have the document, Mr. Lonnergan?
Yes or no.

14:16.951 --> 14:18.787
Yes.

14:20.855 --> 14:24.293
It's-It's-It's in my head,
not in my actual hand.

14:25.393 --> 14:27.359
Okay, the hard way it is.

14:27.361 --> 14:29.762
Your Honor, if I may,

14:29.764 --> 14:31.730
Mr. Lonnergan has
already proven himself

14:31.732 --> 14:34.967
- to be an extremely reckless guardian, someone who's...
- Reckless?

14:34.969 --> 14:37.570
I'm sor... Reckless?

14:37.572 --> 14:41.842
Your Honor, if having an awesome
time with my top dog is reckless,

14:41.844 --> 14:43.408
then yeah,
guilty as charged.

14:43.410 --> 14:45.911
- He took him snowboarding.
- Yes, I did.

14:45.913 --> 14:49.581
- He told me he had the best time of his life.
- He was terrified.

14:49.583 --> 14:52.384
You should have seen his face.
His ears were pinned back.

14:52.386 --> 14:55.454
Since Mr. Lonnergan cannot
provide the adoption record,

14:55.456 --> 14:58.123
I'm forced to consider
other factors.

14:58.125 --> 14:59.258
Yes.

14:59.260 --> 15:01.127
Wesley, if he thinks at all,

15:01.129 --> 15:06.031
thinks 623 Hicks Street, Ms.
Greene's residence, is his home.

15:06.033 --> 15:07.300
Yes.

15:07.302 --> 15:09.636
The evidence supports
Ms. Greene's contention

15:09.638 --> 15:12.838
that she is
the primary caretaker.

15:12.840 --> 15:16.943
She pays for all the costs to provide for
the animal while Mr. Lonnergan here...

15:16.945 --> 15:19.978
Well, I'm an ambassador of
joy, Your Honor.

15:19.980 --> 15:24.751
Seems less prepared for the responsibility
of sole custody at this time.

15:24.753 --> 15:29.022
It is the court's decision to
award sole custody to Ms. Greene.

15:29.024 --> 15:32.892
- Ah!
- Wait. Stop. Rewind. What?

15:32.894 --> 15:35.797
Mr. Lonnergan will have visitation
rights every other weekend.

15:36.865 --> 15:39.065
Well, I object!
Overruled!

15:39.067 --> 15:41.199
He's my dog!

15:41.201 --> 15:45.305
I'm his daddy! Every dog needs his daddy!
Every daddy needs his dog.

15:45.307 --> 15:48.041
Mr. Lonnergan,
this ruling is temporary.

15:48.043 --> 15:52.712
I'll assign a veterinary
behaviorist to evaluate you both,

15:52.714 --> 15:57.217
and there will be a continuance
of this matter in 60 days.

15:57.219 --> 16:02.055
At that point, I'll decide who
gets custody of the dog for good.

16:02.057 --> 16:03.192
Understood?

16:05.659 --> 16:06.827
Yes.

16:08.096 --> 16:09.932
Court's adjourned.

16:17.304 --> 16:20.675
I warned you.
Give me Bumblebee.

16:22.143 --> 16:25.545
- His name's Bumblebee Bob. Bumblebee Bob.
- Uh-huh.

16:25.547 --> 16:28.381
If you think I'm just gonna
roll over and play dead,

16:28.383 --> 16:31.084
you're sadly mistaken.

16:31.086 --> 16:32.287
Here, buddy.

16:33.288 --> 16:35.722
Bring it on.

16:35.724 --> 16:39.228
Oh, I'm gonna
bring it everywhere.

16:41.428 --> 16:43.698
- Game face.
- Give it to her.

16:44.966 --> 16:47.432
- You look like a baby taking a dump.
- That's right.

16:47.434 --> 16:49.301
A little bit, yeah.

16:49.303 --> 16:51.436
- You didn't even see it.
- It was not good.

16:51.438 --> 16:54.206
Say bye to Daddy!
Say bye to your daddy.

16:54.208 --> 16:57.042
- I'll fight for you, Wesley!
- It's a bad day. Come on.

16:57.044 --> 17:01.147
- No matter how long! No matter how far!
- Let's go, buddy. Come on.

17:01.149 --> 17:03.016
- I'll fight for you!
- Let's go.

17:03.018 --> 17:04.483
Come on.
Let's go.

17:07.721 --> 17:12.022
This case is all about me proving
how much I love Wesley. Right?

17:12.025 --> 17:15.762
And what better way to do that
than by representing myself?

17:15.763 --> 17:17.530
So a lawyer's
too expensive, huh?

17:17.531 --> 17:19.766
It's an absolute racket.

17:19.768 --> 17:21.568
You're innocent
until proven broke, man.

17:21.569 --> 17:23.301
What do you got?
A little reading?

17:23.304 --> 17:26.205
<i>"Winning Child Custody: A Father's
Guide."</i> That one looks good.

17:26.208 --> 17:28.673
It's for real human children though.
What's this one?

17:28.675 --> 17:31.677
<i>Custody Warriors.</i>
That one sounds a little aggressive.

17:31.679 --> 17:33.613
But I like where
your head's at.

17:33.615 --> 17:37.583
Well, we <i>are</i> going
to war, my friend.

17:37.585 --> 17:40.319
The fun-loving Clay guy is
just not gonna work anymore.

17:40.321 --> 17:43.788
I have to prove
that I am a... a better,

17:43.790 --> 17:47.160
more responsible parent
than Olive.

17:47.162 --> 17:50.263
Ha! Wow. How are
you gonna do that?

17:50.265 --> 17:52.899
- I have no idea.
- Bit of a stretch.

17:52.901 --> 17:55.601
Oh, here's my nephew.
His deadbeat dad bailed on him,

17:55.603 --> 17:58.740
so my sister asked me to
watch him while she's at work.

17:59.207 --> 18:00.640
Hey, Koji.

18:00.642 --> 18:02.475
This is my friend Clay.

18:02.477 --> 18:05.777
I'm gonna go get ready for practice.
You're gonna hang out here.

18:05.779 --> 18:07.246
See you later.

18:07.248 --> 18:08.917
All right, boys!
Let's go!

18:12.953 --> 18:13.888
Koji, right?

18:26.867 --> 18:29.602
The dog-walker
will be by at 3:00.

18:29.604 --> 18:31.304
This is just
an experiment, sweetie.

18:31.306 --> 18:35.874
If you don't like it, we'll find a
day care center or something, okay?

18:35.876 --> 18:40.646
Mommy got you a special DVD for
dogs in case you get lonely.

18:40.648 --> 18:42.849
It's two paws up,
so that's good, right?

18:42.851 --> 18:44.019
Okay.

18:45.853 --> 18:50.456
Uh... Oh, baby, don't look at me like that.
Mommy has to go to work.

18:50.458 --> 18:53.058
I'll be back soon.

18:53.060 --> 18:54.626
I love you, baby.

18:54.628 --> 18:58.229
Oh, I know you're sad.

18:58.231 --> 19:00.732
Give me a kiss.
It's okay.

19:00.734 --> 19:05.438
I miss you.
I'm gonna miss you.

19:05.440 --> 19:08.039
Oh, I want one more kiss.

19:08.041 --> 19:10.677
Mmm! Yeah!

19:10.679 --> 19:13.212
Okay. I'm going now.
I have to go.

19:13.214 --> 19:14.750
Bye, baby!

19:25.259 --> 19:27.461
Wesley, Mommy's home...

19:29.330 --> 19:32.363
Oh... Oh, my God.

19:32.365 --> 19:33.769
Wesley!

19:36.069 --> 19:38.203
Wesley!

19:38.205 --> 19:40.040
Wesley!

19:42.143 --> 19:44.009
Wesley?

19:44.011 --> 19:45.545
Okay. Okay.

19:47.115 --> 19:49.047
Yes. Uh, hello?

19:49.049 --> 19:52.086
Um, I've been robbed,
and my dog is missing.

19:55.757 --> 19:58.623
Oh. Scratch that.
We're fine.

19:58.625 --> 20:00.593
My apologies.

20:00.595 --> 20:04.263
What are you doing,
little guy?

20:04.265 --> 20:06.932
What are you doing?

20:06.934 --> 20:09.037
Are you serious?

20:16.911 --> 20:18.046
Hmm.

20:19.548 --> 20:22.180
- Hi. I'm sorry I'm late.
- Hey!

20:22.182 --> 20:25.151
- We've been waiting such a long time.
- Wesley, sit.

20:25.153 --> 20:28.886
Hi. Right, because
you're always on time.

20:28.888 --> 20:31.959
Wesley, come here.
Stop, Wesley.

20:33.494 --> 20:35.393
Is that a note
about me being late?

20:35.395 --> 20:37.965
I'm sorry. I cannot share my
notes with you, Ms. Greene.

20:39.166 --> 20:41.366
Oh. Okay.

20:41.368 --> 20:42.534
Sorry.

20:42.536 --> 20:44.304
Welcome.
I'm Dr. Wendy.

20:44.306 --> 20:45.671
I'm a veterinary
behaviorist,

20:45.673 --> 20:48.039
and I've been appointed
as a friend of the court

20:48.041 --> 20:50.575
to help determine who is best
suited to care for Wesley

20:50.577 --> 20:52.681
in the event
of a custody ruling.

20:54.181 --> 20:57.350
Can I just say, Dr. Wendy,
it is a pleasure to be here.

20:57.352 --> 20:59.485
It's a pleasure to have you
here, Mr. Lonnergan.

20:59.487 --> 21:01.754
Thank you.

21:01.756 --> 21:05.560
How about you, Olive?
You happy to be here?

21:06.894 --> 21:10.997
Excuse me. Just so you know,
he's not really like this.

21:10.999 --> 21:14.632
The clothes, the hair, the politeness.
He's doing a thing.

21:14.634 --> 21:17.870
- Olive, I don't know what...
- You will not con your way through this.

21:17.872 --> 21:20.506
The real you
will screw it up.

21:20.508 --> 21:22.374
Olive...
I'm sorry, Doctor.

21:22.376 --> 21:25.710
Can we, uh...
Can we put aside our personal issues

21:25.712 --> 21:28.750
and try and focus
on why we're here?

21:30.417 --> 21:31.950
I hate you.

21:31.952 --> 21:35.988
Uh... Do you often express your
hostilities in front of Wesley?

21:35.990 --> 21:37.025
Hmm.

21:37.825 --> 21:40.025
I'm not hostile.
I'm just...

21:40.027 --> 21:42.197
- Oh.
- What are you writing?

21:47.034 --> 21:48.570
Uh-huh.

21:56.042 --> 21:57.177
Hey.

21:58.313 --> 22:00.513
Okay. Hmm.

22:02.348 --> 22:04.785
Oh.
Interesting.

22:06.354 --> 22:08.719
Wow. Tension.

22:08.721 --> 22:10.189
- Is he okay?
- Shh!

22:10.191 --> 22:12.093
I'm working now.

22:25.839 --> 22:28.806
Okay, Wes.
Okay, Wesley.

22:28.808 --> 22:31.078
- It's okay, Wesley.
- Ohh!

22:32.780 --> 22:34.779
That is what
I was afraid of.

22:34.781 --> 22:38.017
- What? What did he say?
- Is he... Is he okay?

22:38.019 --> 22:40.585
Wesley is on the verge
of psychological disarray.

22:40.587 --> 22:45.123
I mean, just look at him swimming around
in there, lost in his own thoughts.

22:45.125 --> 22:47.559
Well, what are we
supposed to do?

22:47.561 --> 22:51.799
Consistent discipline,
something he is clearly not familiar with.

22:54.000 --> 22:57.236
- Here, take a look at these.
- Love to.

22:57.238 --> 23:01.440
We will meet again so that I
can monitor Wesley's progress.

23:01.442 --> 23:04.809
In addition, I'll be assessing each of
you individually at your respective homes

23:04.811 --> 23:08.480
so I can determine who's providing the
most nurturing environment for Wesley.

23:08.482 --> 23:11.417
The only thing being nurtured
in his trailer is E. coli.

23:11.419 --> 23:14.586
Ms. Greene, as Wesley's primary
caregiver, the burden lies with you

23:14.588 --> 23:18.224
to demonstrate an improvement in
his behavior by our next session.

23:18.226 --> 23:19.926
Hmm.

23:19.928 --> 23:22.097
We're all pulling
for you, Olive.

23:23.631 --> 23:25.697
Psychological disarray.

23:25.699 --> 23:27.302
What are you doing to him?

23:28.536 --> 23:32.103
That woman was clearly insane.
He's perfectly fine.

23:32.105 --> 23:36.040
The professional doggie
whisperer lady says he's not,

23:36.042 --> 23:37.676
so we gotta do something.

23:37.678 --> 23:40.478
He's fine.
He's better than fine.

23:40.480 --> 23:43.317
In fact, we've been having a riot, lately.

23:44.384 --> 23:46.385
Tearing it up,
big time.

23:46.387 --> 23:47.818
Is that right,
butter bones?

23:47.820 --> 23:50.154
You've been tearing it up?

23:50.156 --> 23:51.623
You know what?

23:51.625 --> 23:55.026
We should go see that Glenn guy.
He had a good whistle.

23:55.028 --> 23:57.662
He doesn't need
obedience training.

23:57.664 --> 23:59.297
Okay?

23:59.299 --> 24:02.700
And this thing that you're
doing, this brand-new Clay thing,

24:02.702 --> 24:04.204
it isn't gonna work.

24:17.084 --> 24:21.152
So you got a little cranky and shredded
the living room. Happens to the best of us.

24:21.154 --> 24:24.222
It doesn't mean
you're in disarray.

24:24.224 --> 24:25.392
Does it?

24:27.161 --> 24:28.797
Wesley?

24:31.332 --> 24:33.368
Wesley James!

24:37.270 --> 24:38.938
That's it, mister.

24:38.940 --> 24:41.142
I'm calling
the dog trainer.

24:43.044 --> 24:45.677
Look what else I found.
In 2004, right?

24:45.679 --> 24:47.979
Joshua Little
and Linda Perkins

24:47.981 --> 24:51.350
waged a two-year battle
over their dog, Gee-Gee.

24:51.352 --> 24:52.451
Gigi? Gee-Gee?

24:52.453 --> 24:54.386
- What is it, French?
- Whatever. Probably.

24:54.388 --> 24:57.521
After a three-day trial...
Listen. This is the good part.

24:57.523 --> 24:59.557
Mr. Little prevails.

24:59.559 --> 25:02.361
Pass the puck to anyone
else on the whole team!

25:02.363 --> 25:04.564
- You're never gonna guess how he won.
- What?

25:04.566 --> 25:05.998
Jo... Hey! Jonah!

25:06.000 --> 25:08.132
- Do not lick the ice!
- My tongue is stuck!

25:08.134 --> 25:10.068
I don't think Jonah's
gonna work in goal...

25:10.070 --> 25:13.471
He made a video, a video called
"A Day in the Life of Gigi,"

25:13.473 --> 25:17.375
and he used it as evidence of what
a great life they had together.

25:17.377 --> 25:18.978
A key part of him winning.

25:18.980 --> 25:21.145
Hey, that's it! Stop fighting!

25:21.147 --> 25:23.414
Put your gloves back on!
No fighting!

25:23.416 --> 25:24.984
So that's the plan, man.

25:24.986 --> 25:28.520
Just make an awesome video
showing how we are the...

25:28.522 --> 25:30.655
the ultimate ambassadors of joy.

25:30.657 --> 25:32.557
- You with me?
- Yeah. Big time.

25:32.559 --> 25:33.792
- For sure.
- Good man.

25:33.794 --> 25:35.961
What are we doing?

25:35.963 --> 25:38.529
We'll figure it out later.
Hang on a second.

25:38.531 --> 25:40.665
All right, shift change! Let's go!

25:40.667 --> 25:42.002
Koj, ready to hop in?

25:45.940 --> 25:48.540
Can you talk to him?
Like a pep talk or something?

25:48.542 --> 25:51.709
I can't get him on the ice.
He's just sad all the time.

25:51.711 --> 25:54.513
- What am I gonna say?
- You're a professional hockey player.

25:54.515 --> 25:58.383
Just inspire him. Make something
up about dedication, teamwork.

25:58.385 --> 26:01.055
Whatever your coach says to you guys.
I don't know.

26:22.410 --> 26:23.845
Life.

26:29.817 --> 26:32.252
It stinks, right?

26:34.788 --> 26:37.458
It just makes you
so mad sometimes.

26:39.926 --> 26:44.629
You know what I do, Koji,
when life gets me mad?

26:44.631 --> 26:46.000
Hmm?

26:48.803 --> 26:51.206
I get mad
right back at it.

26:52.807 --> 26:55.874
It feels good
to let off a little steam.

26:55.876 --> 26:59.146
But I do it out there, man,
on the ice.

26:59.948 --> 27:02.250
Oh, yeah.

27:05.486 --> 27:07.522
That's hockey, man.

27:08.455 --> 27:09.988
Go ahead. Try it.

27:09.990 --> 27:12.324
I know you got
some steam in there.

27:12.326 --> 27:16.428
Pick up this bag. Just slam it down.
Let out that steam.

27:16.430 --> 27:17.528
Come on!

27:17.530 --> 27:19.698
Lift it!

27:19.700 --> 27:21.933
How about this?
Come on.

27:21.935 --> 27:25.003
One, two, three.

27:25.005 --> 27:29.477
That's hockey, man!
Come on! Incoming!

27:30.345 --> 27:32.447
Get down!

27:36.415 --> 27:39.918
Hey! What the hell's
going on in here?

27:39.920 --> 27:41.286
Hockey.

27:41.288 --> 27:42.621
Hockey?

27:42.623 --> 27:44.122
Just hockey.

27:44.124 --> 27:45.993
We should clean this up, huh?

27:52.133 --> 27:55.670
- He's a good boy.
- Yes, he is.

27:58.204 --> 27:59.904
It's okay.
Shh, shh.

27:59.906 --> 28:03.278
Okay, folks.
Start the show.

28:04.778 --> 28:07.813
- I usually like to start with a little demonstration.
- Ooh.

28:07.815 --> 28:10.016
Demonstration.

28:10.018 --> 28:12.183
Clyde. Clyde.

28:18.025 --> 28:20.159
Meet Master Tank.

28:20.161 --> 28:23.795
He was picked up last night
at a police-raided dogfight.

28:23.797 --> 28:25.029
He's a trained killer.

28:25.031 --> 28:26.366
Okay.

28:27.166 --> 28:32.738
Your dog is 99.8% wolf.

28:32.740 --> 28:33.972
I told you.

28:35.875 --> 28:37.910
- And wolves...
- Wes.

28:37.912 --> 28:39.711
run in packs.

28:41.582 --> 28:44.218
Ooh!

28:46.753 --> 28:48.953
Your dog needs
a pack leader.

28:48.955 --> 28:50.623
Oh, Wesley, no!

28:50.625 --> 28:51.923
Sorry.

28:51.925 --> 28:53.327
Stop that, Wesley.

28:54.728 --> 28:56.327
Olive, right?

28:56.329 --> 28:58.365
Yeah, you remember
my name?

28:59.366 --> 29:00.665
Of course.

29:00.667 --> 29:03.236
Would you say that you're
this dog's pack leader?

29:03.936 --> 29:06.905
Well, I'm his mommy.

29:06.907 --> 29:08.672
Right here.

29:08.674 --> 29:11.142
- You're the leader?
- Yep.

29:11.144 --> 29:13.844
- Sssss. Uh-uh-uh.
- Stop.

29:13.846 --> 29:16.113
I don't think
Wesley thinks so.

29:16.115 --> 29:19.753
He's uncomfortable,
tense.

29:20.887 --> 29:22.621
Wesley, Wesley, Wesley.

29:22.623 --> 29:25.391
No, he just... It's a little game.
A little game.

29:25.393 --> 29:28.328
Ah-ha!
Wesley James Lonnergan!

29:32.900 --> 29:34.132
Traitor.

29:34.134 --> 29:36.567
I have to say,
Wesley needs help.

29:36.569 --> 29:39.805
His behavior won't
improve on its own.

29:39.807 --> 29:42.841
That's a good boy.
You just need a pack leader, don't you?

29:42.843 --> 29:44.410
Is this guy for real?

29:44.412 --> 29:46.478
- Good boy.
- I think he's great.

29:46.480 --> 29:52.517
With a few more sessions,
you'll have "The Hannon Way" down pat.

29:52.519 --> 29:53.786
Okay.

29:53.788 --> 29:56.287
We can set up another
group session like this

29:56.289 --> 29:59.123
that you and your...
boyfriend?

29:59.125 --> 30:01.628
Um, we're separated.

30:02.729 --> 30:04.796
Recently.
It's recent.

30:04.798 --> 30:07.766
My one-on-one sessions are
a fast-track way of helping,

30:07.768 --> 30:11.003
but I only work
with one owner at a time.

30:11.005 --> 30:12.237
Might that
interest you?

30:12.239 --> 30:13.708
- Yes.
- No.

30:17.109 --> 30:18.545
Fantastic. Okay.

30:19.480 --> 30:21.149
Let's try
something else.

30:40.500 --> 30:42.103
Check him out.

30:50.243 --> 30:52.679
Not bad for an old guy.

30:57.651 --> 30:58.918
Bumblebee Bob?

30:58.920 --> 31:01.152
It's his favorite
stuffed animal,

31:01.154 --> 31:03.255
and it's like
a comfort blanket to him,

31:03.257 --> 31:05.289
and, you know,
it calms him down.

31:05.291 --> 31:08.226
Your dog shouldn't need
a comfort blanket.

31:08.228 --> 31:11.499
- And...
- Uh-huh.

31:15.035 --> 31:16.370
Relax.

31:17.671 --> 31:19.237
Don't worry.

31:19.239 --> 31:21.006
I'm gonna help you.

31:21.008 --> 31:24.977
With the proper training,
these problems will go away.

31:24.979 --> 31:26.644
Okay.

31:26.646 --> 31:29.148
Okay. Okay.

31:29.150 --> 31:31.082
All right.
Let's start with posture.

31:31.084 --> 31:32.683
What, Wesley's posture's bad?

31:32.685 --> 31:34.987
Not Wesley's. Yours.

31:34.989 --> 31:38.088
There's a tension in your
body that Wesley can sense,

31:38.090 --> 31:40.560
and it makes him anxious.

31:41.327 --> 31:44.231
Watch.
Feel my upper body.

31:45.199 --> 31:46.868
- Excuse me?
- Start with the shoulders.

31:53.307 --> 31:54.842
You feel that?

31:55.776 --> 31:58.712
Firm, yet relaxed.

31:59.846 --> 32:01.481
It certainly is.

32:04.617 --> 32:06.517
Hey, that was
a great first session.

32:06.519 --> 32:11.256
Remember, treat him like a
dog, not like a child.

32:11.258 --> 32:13.491
- I'll try.
- It's what he needs.

32:13.493 --> 32:14.558
Okay.

32:14.560 --> 32:18.598
Hey, would you like
to... go out sometime?

32:19.599 --> 32:22.867
Without Wesley.
Just... Just me and you?

32:22.869 --> 32:27.305
Um, you mean on, like,
a date-type thing?

32:27.307 --> 32:29.743
Yeah.
Like a date-type thing.

32:31.511 --> 32:34.347
- Is it okay if I think about it?
- Of course.

32:35.315 --> 32:36.914
- Okay.
- See ya later.

32:36.916 --> 32:38.350
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

32:38.352 --> 32:40.254
Thanks. Okay.

32:45.425 --> 32:48.393
I packed his therma-paw
boots in case it's icy.

32:48.395 --> 32:52.365
This is what it was like Thursday
nights when I would go to my dad's.

32:53.299 --> 32:54.935
Oh. I almost forgot.

32:57.971 --> 32:59.740
Shoot.

33:07.146 --> 33:08.281
Can't...

33:09.383 --> 33:12.350
find... Bumblebee Bob,

33:12.352 --> 33:15.256
so if he whines at night,
here's my shirt.

33:17.090 --> 33:18.957
Wait.
You lost Bumblebee Bob?

33:18.959 --> 33:20.494
Don't start.

33:21.694 --> 33:24.796
- Hey.
- Hey, baby. Come here, baby.

33:24.798 --> 33:27.833
Mommy loves you.
Mommy loves you.

33:27.835 --> 33:31.737
I'm gonna miss you, Wesley.
I'm gonna miss you.

33:31.739 --> 33:34.342
You're a good mom, you know that?

33:35.442 --> 33:38.442
Crazy, but good.

33:38.444 --> 33:40.010
All right, buddy.

33:40.012 --> 33:41.546
Oh. Oh, wait.

33:41.548 --> 33:42.583
Uh...

33:44.785 --> 33:49.287
I thought we could both read
this and work on it together,

33:49.289 --> 33:51.725
see what works for Wesley,
what doesn't.

33:54.661 --> 33:56.260
You're seriously
seeing this guy?

33:56.262 --> 33:58.497
Yeah. Twice a week.

33:58.499 --> 34:01.032
Come on. You know,
I was thinking about that.

34:01.034 --> 34:03.669
When my parents split up,
I was out of control.

34:03.671 --> 34:07.305
Fights, tantrums,
inappropriate peeing.

34:07.307 --> 34:10.708
Case in point,
he'll get over it.

34:10.710 --> 34:14.143
He doesn't need... this guy.

34:14.146 --> 34:16.480
Well, it was your idea,

34:16.482 --> 34:18.984
so I guess I'm just
going along with it.

34:18.985 --> 34:21.819
Well, I'm full of bad ideas.
You know that.

34:21.821 --> 34:23.987
I do know that.

34:23.989 --> 34:27.661
But, um, we're gonna keep doing
it 'cause it's good for Wesley.

34:32.967 --> 34:34.565
Bye, baby!

34:34.568 --> 34:37.001
Bye, Wesley!
Bye, Wesley!

34:37.003 --> 34:39.003
You done with this?

34:39.005 --> 34:42.042
- Well, I am now.
- Hmm.

34:43.510 --> 34:46.512
- Okay, what's going on?
- What are you talking about?

34:46.514 --> 34:48.649
When you get nervous,
you eat like a zombie.

34:49.782 --> 34:51.481
The trainer guy asked me out.

34:51.483 --> 34:53.485
Oh, the handsome dog guy
with the pecs?

34:53.487 --> 34:55.686
Mmm. Mm-hmm.

34:55.688 --> 34:57.222
Okay, so what's
the problem?

34:57.224 --> 34:59.891
I don't know if Wesley's ready
for another man in my life.

34:59.893 --> 35:02.562
Well,
I think we both know who's not ready.

35:04.465 --> 35:06.432
Who says I need a man?

35:06.434 --> 35:07.999
Good plan.

35:08.001 --> 35:10.371
Keep your heart in a cage
and die alone.

35:13.740 --> 35:15.673
We're gonna
try this again, okay?

35:15.675 --> 35:17.608
Put the black-and-white
filter on.

35:17.610 --> 35:20.211
- It always looks like film noir, right?
- It'll look... Yeah.

35:20.213 --> 35:22.514
- Wesley.
- Action.

35:22.516 --> 35:24.916
I hear... Well, you can't
be shooting now.

35:24.918 --> 35:26.150
- I've gotta...
- Oh.

35:26.152 --> 35:28.286
- give the instructions, and then you shoot.
- Yeah.

35:28.288 --> 35:29.753
You got this.

35:29.755 --> 35:32.190
Wes, Daddy is gonna
throw the stick.

35:32.192 --> 35:34.825
You run.
You pick up the stick.

35:34.827 --> 35:37.628
Listen, listen.
This is the part where you always forget.

35:37.630 --> 35:40.666
You gotta bring it back to Daddy.
Okay? Don't run off.

35:40.668 --> 35:43.101
Koj, you ready?
It's take number...

35:43.103 --> 35:44.601
- Seven.
- Seven. Okay.

35:44.603 --> 35:47.507
Buddy.
One, two, three, go!

35:49.476 --> 35:51.075
- Uh...
- No.

35:51.077 --> 35:54.679
That's, uh... Should we try it again? Go!

35:54.681 --> 35:56.815
- There he goes.
- That's a good start.

35:56.817 --> 35:59.650
So why don't we like this guy?
What's-his-face?

35:59.652 --> 36:02.019
- Glenn.
- Yeah, Glenn. What's his problem?

36:02.021 --> 36:03.054
âª Da-da-da-da âª

36:03.056 --> 36:04.123
- Ooh.
- Right?

36:04.125 --> 36:06.057
Because he looks like
a well-read superhero?

36:06.059 --> 36:07.892
I could see why Olive's
into him then.

36:07.894 --> 36:10.561
- This dude is a babe.
- No, she's not into him.

36:10.563 --> 36:14.133
- No?
- No. She just thinks a couple of one-on-one sessions might help.

36:14.135 --> 36:16.869
- I agree.
- Yeah, I bet she does.

36:16.871 --> 36:20.003
- What, you think I'm worried about him?
- I mean...

36:20.005 --> 36:24.508
I'm a professional hockey
player, dude, not a dog trainer.

36:24.510 --> 36:26.577
You play for a minor league team.
Secondly...

36:26.579 --> 36:28.847
- The Wolves.
- Yeah, minor league team.

36:28.849 --> 36:30.782
And you're not ri...
This guy's rich, man.

36:30.784 --> 36:34.086
He's got books out.
He's got that super-hot rich face.

36:34.088 --> 36:35.554
Well, this is my year.

36:35.556 --> 36:37.487
- For what?
- Hot rich face?

36:37.489 --> 36:39.057
His face is hot and rich.

36:39.059 --> 36:42.661
Koj! Yeah, tell him to bring it back now.

36:42.663 --> 36:44.563
Oh, you've been
a good boy!

36:44.565 --> 36:46.197
Bring the stick back.

36:46.199 --> 36:47.965
Dude, I got your back.

36:47.967 --> 36:51.568
But the average age of retirement
for an NHL goalie is, what, 28, 29?

36:51.570 --> 36:53.704
- Thirty?
- We had this discussion. Moe Roberts.

36:53.706 --> 36:55.907
- All right.
- Played for the Blackhawks until he was 46.

36:55.909 --> 36:58.275
Yeah, 100 years old.
Okay.

36:58.277 --> 36:59.978
That's besides the point.

36:59.980 --> 37:02.613
Wouldn't that be crazy if this
dude was Wesley's new stepdad?

37:02.615 --> 37:03.882
Look at that...

37:03.884 --> 37:06.651
That jawline is just
chiseled like a Roman god,

37:06.653 --> 37:09.054
like a...
like a marble bust.

37:09.056 --> 37:11.923
That is a...
Oh, God, that's a sharp-looking man.

37:11.925 --> 37:14.126
I'll get Olive
to give you his number

37:14.128 --> 37:16.494
and you can ask him
on a date yourself.

37:16.496 --> 37:20.130
If this is bothering you... Are you having
second thoughts about the whole Olive thing?

37:20.132 --> 37:22.666
- No, I just want my dog back.
- All right.

37:22.668 --> 37:25.070
"Ambassadors of Joy,"
take one.

37:25.072 --> 37:26.137
Hey, hey.

37:26.139 --> 37:28.238
Oh, hi.

37:28.240 --> 37:31.642
Uh, before we have a hot
chocolate in the morning,

37:31.644 --> 37:34.912
Wesley and I like to take a little
five-mile run around the lake.

37:34.914 --> 37:37.148
Don't we, buddy?

37:37.150 --> 37:38.950
Let's go! Oh!

37:38.952 --> 37:41.552
- Wesley, go!
- Okay.

37:41.554 --> 37:43.521
- Go!
- Hey, Coach. Cut that, Coach.

37:43.523 --> 37:45.123
Your dog's still here.

37:45.125 --> 37:46.425
Action.

37:48.128 --> 37:52.530
Me and Wesley, we even do laundry
together, don't we, buddy?

37:52.532 --> 37:54.932
Bring it here.
Oh, yeah.

37:54.934 --> 37:57.168
Out. Out. Out.

37:57.170 --> 37:59.003
Oh! Oop.

37:59.005 --> 38:01.639
Just leave it for Daddy.
This is Daddy's now.

38:01.641 --> 38:04.041
Daddy's gonna put that up.
Oh, oh. That's Daddy's.

38:04.043 --> 38:07.378
No, no, no.
Video's going great.

38:07.380 --> 38:10.816
We're just inseparable.
I don't know what it is about him.

38:10.818 --> 38:14.519
It's just his coat,
his lovable little...

38:16.023 --> 38:18.456
- And he... he just does...
- Cut.

38:18.458 --> 38:20.624
Things like that.
Where is he going?

38:20.626 --> 38:24.195
Wesley, this is...

38:24.197 --> 38:25.930
Hi.

38:25.932 --> 38:31.769
Yes, I've made several canine-friendly
accommodations to Wesley's living quarters,

38:31.771 --> 38:33.905
and he just loves it.

38:33.907 --> 38:37.111
This is my latest version
of canine carpentry.

38:40.813 --> 38:44.315
Wesley! Wesley!

38:44.317 --> 38:47.184
- Should we start over?
- I thought that was pretty good.

38:47.186 --> 38:51.025
Is that good for court? You wanna
show the judge that? That doghouse?

38:52.458 --> 38:55.494
- We can show the judge that doghouse.
- Put another level in post.

38:55.496 --> 38:57.829
Hey. Out.

38:57.831 --> 39:00.164
- Koji, let's cut.
- He's going to poo!

39:00.166 --> 39:01.298
Oh, attaboy.

39:01.300 --> 39:04.337
Droppin' a deuce.
We don't need to see that.

39:14.012 --> 39:18.450
What more could we want, butter bones, huh?

39:18.452 --> 39:22.323
A Ping-Pong table, Jacuzzi.

39:24.458 --> 39:25.490
Look at me.

39:27.327 --> 39:31.932
I know how it feels to be from a broken home, pal.

39:37.336 --> 39:39.003
You got me.

39:40.507 --> 39:44.708
That's enough, right?

39:44.710 --> 39:46.279
Obviously not.

39:51.483 --> 39:53.953
Let's see if this works.

39:55.655 --> 39:58.488
Mommy's shirt.
Yeah.

39:58.490 --> 40:00.159
You like that, huh?

40:14.239 --> 40:16.275
Here we are.

40:20.612 --> 40:24.481
- Dinner was fantastic.
- Yes.

40:24.483 --> 40:27.119
Remind me never to share
dessert with you again.

40:27.121 --> 40:29.653
I think
I had one spoonful.

40:29.655 --> 40:31.389
I'm sorry.

40:31.391 --> 40:33.291
It was so good.

40:33.293 --> 40:37.862
And I really haven't been anywhere that
special in a long time, so thank you.

40:37.864 --> 40:40.067
Oh, that's a real shame.

40:41.233 --> 40:44.735
Well, it was a great night.
Thank you.

40:44.737 --> 40:46.172
It doesn't have to end.

40:47.005 --> 40:48.606
Um...

40:48.608 --> 40:50.911
- Can I tell you something?
- Yes.

40:52.344 --> 40:53.945
Secret.

40:53.947 --> 40:54.948
Oh.

40:59.418 --> 41:00.887
Um...

41:01.621 --> 41:03.287
Yeah, I'm... I'm just not...

41:03.289 --> 41:04.458
I...

41:05.557 --> 41:07.391
I just think it's too s...

41:07.393 --> 41:08.992
It's okay.
No, I get it.

41:08.994 --> 41:10.762
- There's no need to rush things.
- Sorry.

41:10.764 --> 41:12.796
Oh, no need to rush things.
It's okay.

41:12.798 --> 41:15.335
- Okay, yeah.
- I, um, just...

41:16.536 --> 41:18.336
It just feels right
with you.

41:18.338 --> 41:20.040
It really does.

41:21.474 --> 41:23.909
Tha... Thank you.
That's nice.

41:23.911 --> 41:26.043
Thank you
for understanding.

41:26.045 --> 41:29.813
Um... Okay,
well, good night.

41:29.815 --> 41:31.414
Good night.

41:31.416 --> 41:33.219
Thank you.

41:34.454 --> 41:37.257
- Call me or something.
- Okay.

41:47.634 --> 41:49.800
Ooh!

41:49.802 --> 41:52.205
That cleared your head!
Am I right?

41:53.472 --> 41:55.773
Totally clear. Yep.

41:55.775 --> 41:57.411
- Thanks.
- Oh, yeah.

42:11.257 --> 42:13.090
Hey, you guys.

42:13.092 --> 42:15.059
Oh, Wesley, come here, baby.

42:15.061 --> 42:18.128
Come here.
Oh, yes, baby, yes!

42:18.130 --> 42:20.699
How are you?
How are you?

42:20.701 --> 42:23.934
Wesley. Wesley. Yeah.

42:23.936 --> 42:25.938
Mommy missed you.

42:28.041 --> 42:30.708
- He loves it here.
- Yeah?

42:30.710 --> 42:34.148
- Well, thanks for showing him a good time.
- It's what I do.

42:36.115 --> 42:38.782
So how was he,
behavior-wise?

42:38.784 --> 42:42.420
Oh, he was... he was...
a perfect gentleman.

42:42.422 --> 42:44.190
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Mwah.

42:45.525 --> 42:50.929
No, um, whining at night or,
you know, tearing things up?

42:50.931 --> 42:53.534
- None of that?
- No, look, my diagnosis...

42:55.335 --> 42:57.804
He just needed some alone
time with his poparooni.

43:00.206 --> 43:01.271
Okay.

43:01.273 --> 43:02.442
Mm-hmm.

43:06.213 --> 43:08.382
Okay, bye!

43:10.784 --> 43:13.851
Wesley, are you being better
with Daddy than you are with me?

43:13.853 --> 43:15.351
Are you doing that?

43:15.353 --> 43:18.192
Wesley, that is not right.

43:21.594 --> 43:24.595
Hayden, dump and chase. We're gonna
work on that shooting now, buddy.

43:24.597 --> 43:26.932
That a boy.
Focus.

43:26.934 --> 43:28.869
Oh!
That's okay. Hey.

43:29.869 --> 43:32.003
Kadurski, where did
you get a doughnut?

43:32.005 --> 43:34.472
Let's try one more.
Come on.

43:34.474 --> 43:38.108
When you drop the puck,
you're gonna look at the puck real quick,

43:38.110 --> 43:39.642
then look
where you're gonna shoot.

43:39.644 --> 43:41.979
Go!

43:41.981 --> 43:44.083
That's all right.
Let's try that again.

43:46.119 --> 43:49.420
This stinks!
I can't do it!

43:49.422 --> 43:51.190
Whoa! Hey.

43:52.291 --> 43:55.193
How are you gonna score
without a stick? Huh?

43:55.195 --> 43:57.862
What happens when the puck
comes at you?

43:57.864 --> 44:00.632
What if another puck
comes flying at you?

44:00.634 --> 44:02.566
What if another puck...

44:02.568 --> 44:05.204
Oh, you're just gonna
hit it away like that?

44:07.472 --> 44:08.905
Oh.

44:08.907 --> 44:11.612
Oh-ho-ho-ho. Rhett!

44:12.911 --> 44:14.479
I think
we found your goalie.

44:14.481 --> 44:15.780
Yeah?

44:15.782 --> 44:18.452
Welcome
to the crease club.

44:19.585 --> 44:22.686
I know. I know. I need it.
Can I have it back?

44:22.688 --> 44:24.320
Wesley, I need it back.

44:24.322 --> 44:27.157
I need it back.
I need it back.

44:27.159 --> 44:32.896
Wesley, remember, you're not supposed
to sleep with me in the bed anymore.

44:32.898 --> 44:36.166
You're gonna have
to go to your own bed.

44:36.168 --> 44:39.237
I'll take you in a few minutes.
You can snuggle for now.

44:39.239 --> 44:41.441
Yeah, you can snuggle.

44:44.443 --> 44:47.447
This is nice, right?
Just the two of us?

44:48.248 --> 44:49.349
Yeah.

44:50.248 --> 44:52.518
We don't need Daddy,
right?

44:53.219 --> 44:55.720
It's better without him.

44:55.722 --> 44:57.789
No more snoring,

44:57.791 --> 45:00.657
no more screaming
at the TV.

45:00.659 --> 45:02.161
Mm-hmm.

45:03.061 --> 45:06.132
No more wet,
stinky hockey socks.

45:07.733 --> 45:09.670
It's better, right?

45:10.836 --> 45:12.371
Yeah.

45:14.907 --> 45:17.008
This is Wesley's
first time here.

45:17.010 --> 45:20.144
Oh, Wesley will make best friends here.
We're a family really.

45:20.146 --> 45:22.146
Happy Hound Day Care
is a perfect place

45:22.148 --> 45:24.451
for Wesley to play,
laugh and discover.

45:25.684 --> 45:29.220
- Are those, um...
- Oh. Those are original works.

45:29.222 --> 45:32.088
We set aside a portion of
each day for arts and crafts.

45:32.090 --> 45:34.825
They are just
so talented.

45:34.827 --> 45:36.362
I can see that.

45:37.230 --> 45:39.164
He's gonna love it.

45:39.166 --> 45:41.666
Okay. Thank you.

45:41.668 --> 45:43.200
Mommy has to go.

45:43.202 --> 45:44.802
Have a great time.

45:44.804 --> 45:46.269
Okay.
I'll give you the leash.

45:46.271 --> 45:48.005
Free yourself of those thoughts.

45:48.007 --> 45:49.641
Get that energy flowing.

45:49.643 --> 45:52.543
Okay, Jen, the energy's starting to
flow right down through his tail,

45:52.545 --> 45:55.112
so we're gonna use the
paw, dip it in the paint.

45:55.114 --> 45:57.215
Think of the birds
on the trees.

45:57.217 --> 45:59.918
Get the paw...
There you go.

45:59.920 --> 46:01.552
Feel his energy shift?

46:01.554 --> 46:04.755
His energy shifted when you did
that, all the way through his tail.

46:04.757 --> 46:06.057
Okay?

46:06.059 --> 46:08.360
Wesley, when you're ready,
come make a painting.

46:14.199 --> 46:17.034
Lindsey.
The burnt sienna?

46:27.045 --> 46:28.646
Somebody stop him!

46:28.648 --> 46:31.849
He's Jackson Pollocking the hallway!
Oh, no, no, no, no!

46:31.851 --> 46:34.584
Stop him!
No, no, no, no, no!

46:34.586 --> 46:37.021
Get back! Wesley!

46:37.023 --> 46:41.361
That is what I'm trying to say. I think clearly
the dog has some sort of anxiety disorder.

46:43.362 --> 46:44.561
Wes.

46:44.563 --> 46:46.563
Kenneth,
I have to call you back.

46:46.565 --> 46:51.668
Sir, Wesley ruined a number of paintings
today, not to mention my office.

46:51.670 --> 46:54.637
Paintings? Why is
he painting anyway?

46:54.639 --> 46:56.639
Why is he in a cage?

46:56.641 --> 47:00.911
He was being overly animated,
so I put him in the time-out corner.

47:00.913 --> 47:04.115
- You're lucky I don't get overly animated.
- Don't point your finger at me.

47:04.117 --> 47:07.050
- There's three pointing back at you and your dog.
- What's next? Waterboarding?

47:07.052 --> 47:08.820
Come here, buddy.
Unbelievable.

47:08.822 --> 47:11.255
- Come on, buddy.
- Hey, what are you doing here?

47:11.257 --> 47:13.557
Uh, you listed him
as your emergency contact.

47:13.559 --> 47:16.760
So when I got your voice mail,
I called him. Sorry.

47:16.762 --> 47:19.796
- Emergency? Really?
- Did you see the hallway?

47:19.798 --> 47:21.632
Shut the door, please.

47:21.634 --> 47:24.802
You put him
in doggy GuantÃ¡namo.

47:24.804 --> 47:26.436
It was nothing
like that.

47:26.438 --> 47:28.438
A torture chamber.

47:28.440 --> 47:30.139
Can I ask you a question?

47:30.141 --> 47:33.811
Would you rather leave him with complete
strangers than with his own dad?

47:33.813 --> 47:37.715
They were not strangers.
It was doggy day care.

47:37.717 --> 47:40.050
You could have called me.
I would have taken him.

47:40.052 --> 47:42.519
But it was not
your day to have him.

47:42.521 --> 47:46.523
- Why does it have to...
- Wesley, come here!

47:46.525 --> 47:48.425
Come here.

47:48.427 --> 47:50.130
That lamp shouldn't
be there anyway.

47:52.597 --> 47:55.666
You need to realize that you
may no longer be married,

47:55.668 --> 47:58.836
but you still
share custody of Wesley.

47:58.838 --> 48:03.775
You need to manage that,
both for Wesley and for yourselves.

48:03.777 --> 48:04.744
Yes, Dr. Wendy.

48:12.452 --> 48:15.186
Maybe the dog lady's right.

48:15.188 --> 48:17.454
Yeah.

48:17.456 --> 48:20.791
Yeah, I mean, I still get
a knot in my belly

48:20.793 --> 48:25.528
when I think back to my mom and dad,
I mean, just at each other's throats.

48:25.530 --> 48:28.867
- It's not good.
- We don't have to be like that.

48:28.869 --> 48:32.606
No, we don't have to be like that.
I don't wanna be like that.

48:34.005 --> 48:36.606
Maybe it would be good
for Wesley

48:36.608 --> 48:41.313
if we, you know, were together
every once in a while.

48:43.817 --> 48:46.887
Once in a while,
we should get the band back together.

48:49.221 --> 48:51.224
I mean, nice.

49:06.039 --> 49:08.371
- Okay.
- Clay, cake!

49:08.373 --> 49:11.644
When I get the cake,
you guys keep Wesley here.

49:13.012 --> 49:14.878
You know,
this was a good idea.

49:14.880 --> 49:17.750
- We need plates.
- Plates.

49:21.320 --> 49:24.523
- You never fixed this.
- <i>You</i> never fixed it.

49:28.961 --> 49:30.329
Do you remember?

49:30.896 --> 49:32.666
Do I remember?

49:35.268 --> 49:38.804
It was at the end
of the longest road trip.

49:40.972 --> 49:43.340
I couldn't wait to get
you into the bedroom.

49:43.342 --> 49:45.776
I willingly jumped up there.

49:45.778 --> 49:48.380
Hung on for dear life.

49:53.719 --> 49:55.487
It's, um...

49:57.822 --> 50:00.891
This is nice, right?

50:02.762 --> 50:03.760
I know, I know.

50:03.762 --> 50:06.130
- He's getting impatient.
- Okay.

50:06.132 --> 50:07.664
Up top.

50:07.666 --> 50:10.300
Ooh, man.
How about you? Ah!

50:10.302 --> 50:12.737
Wesley's
really happy, right?

50:12.739 --> 50:14.639
Yeah, he's like
every little guy.

50:14.641 --> 50:17.775
He just wants to see his parents happy, together,

50:17.777 --> 50:19.677
having fun.

50:19.679 --> 50:22.447
- Come on, man.
- So what are we gonna do about that?

50:22.449 --> 50:25.650
I'm sure we can figure
something out, right?

50:25.652 --> 50:27.450
Like what?

50:27.452 --> 50:29.456
- Like...
- Hello!

50:30.722 --> 50:33.758
- Where's the birthday dog?
- Oh.

50:33.760 --> 50:35.726
Olive!

50:35.728 --> 50:37.193
Hey.

50:37.195 --> 50:38.398
Yeah.

50:39.264 --> 50:40.530
Right on, buddy.

50:40.532 --> 50:43.633
- Hey, Glenn.
- Clay, what's up?

50:43.635 --> 50:45.436
I didn't know
you were coming.

50:45.438 --> 50:48.271
- Did you invite Glenn?
- No. Hi.

50:48.273 --> 50:50.608
- I did not.
- Well, he's here.

50:50.610 --> 50:52.376
I may have
mentioned it, but...

50:52.378 --> 50:54.110
I was in the neighborhood,

50:54.112 --> 50:57.481
and, uh, we've been... we've been seeing
a little bit of each other lately.

50:57.483 --> 51:01.855
Yeah. Yeah, she told me about the
private sessions. That's great.

51:02.554 --> 51:04.056
And we're dating.

51:05.123 --> 51:06.289
Awesome.

51:06.291 --> 51:07.994
Yep.

51:11.396 --> 51:13.396
Hey, Wesley!

51:13.398 --> 51:16.367
Who's a good boy?
Yeah!

51:16.369 --> 51:17.937
Happy birthday!

51:19.170 --> 51:21.640
- Here, Koji.
- Lovely.

51:22.608 --> 51:23.910
Hi.

51:25.043 --> 51:26.309
- Hi!
- How are ya?

51:26.311 --> 51:28.479
Good. Nice...
Nice to see you.

51:28.481 --> 51:30.548
Yeah, it's good.
How are you?

51:30.550 --> 51:32.818
- All right.
- I'm just gonna put this...

51:35.521 --> 51:36.854
I need a big knife.

51:36.856 --> 51:38.521
- Who's this guy?
- Yeah. Let's get...

51:38.523 --> 51:40.456
- This is Koji.
- Koji. All right.

51:40.458 --> 51:44.329
This is Emily.
You already met Libby.

51:44.331 --> 51:47.530
- And Clay.
- Oh, yeah. Clay. My man, Clay.

51:47.532 --> 51:49.566
Is he one?

51:49.568 --> 51:54.374
Is he two?
Is he three?

52:48.527 --> 52:51.431
You knocked me down.
Let's go again!

52:52.431 --> 52:53.630
Harder!

52:53.632 --> 52:55.769
I want it hard! Let's go!

53:02.442 --> 53:05.141
Nice job, Lonnergan.
Looking good.

53:05.143 --> 53:08.013
Thanks, Coach.
I'm great.

53:09.014 --> 53:10.583
Feeling great.

53:12.652 --> 53:14.818
Wesley and I have been
training with Glenn Hannon.

53:14.820 --> 53:17.988
Do you know him?
He's got a great reputation.

53:17.990 --> 53:20.191
Hmm. Huh.

53:20.193 --> 53:23.427
I believe it's important that
dogs sleep in their own bed.

53:23.429 --> 53:25.396
Oh, yes. Of course.

53:25.398 --> 53:27.298
He loves his bed.

53:27.300 --> 53:29.465
He sleeps in that bed
every night.

53:29.467 --> 53:31.434
He never,
ever sleeps with me.

53:31.436 --> 53:34.371
- Hmm. Really?
- Yeah, no.

53:34.373 --> 53:37.641
- Can you please direct him to get in his bed?
- Oh, he... Yes.

53:37.643 --> 53:39.545
Of course I can.

53:40.244 --> 53:41.811
Yes.

53:41.813 --> 53:46.483
Wesley.

53:46.485 --> 53:47.987
Get into your bed.

53:48.686 --> 53:52.255
Wesley, get into your bed.

53:52.257 --> 53:54.493
Wesley,
get into your bed!

54:00.800 --> 54:01.865
Yeah.

54:01.867 --> 54:04.967
- Well, we're a work in progress.
- Mm-hmm.

54:06.639 --> 54:08.608
I mean,
but he's so cute.

54:10.909 --> 54:13.110
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

54:13.112 --> 54:14.577
Oh, hey.

54:14.579 --> 54:17.113
How is
practice going?

54:17.115 --> 54:19.219
Well, this is my year.

54:22.188 --> 54:23.556
Here.

54:25.858 --> 54:28.157
Um...

54:28.159 --> 54:32.699
Well, this is the... the last visitation
until the court reconvenes, so...

54:35.099 --> 54:37.703
I told you I'd make
you a copy of these.

54:47.246 --> 54:49.081
- Nice.
- Mm-hmm.

54:55.721 --> 54:57.054
- All right.
- Okay.

54:57.056 --> 54:59.858
Let's go be men, huh?

55:05.931 --> 55:07.597
Get that stick ready, man.

55:07.599 --> 55:11.136
You gotta get...
You gotta get that stick ready. Yeah? No?

55:12.570 --> 55:15.074
Get frustrated.
Get angry!

55:16.041 --> 55:17.243
I can't!

55:18.443 --> 55:20.844
Listen to me.
Sometimes you do everything right,

55:20.846 --> 55:22.648
and the puck's
still gonna go in.

55:23.748 --> 55:26.150
It doesn't change
who you are, man.

55:26.152 --> 55:28.452
All right?

55:28.454 --> 55:29.989
You got this.

55:47.972 --> 55:49.608
Wah!

56:24.409 --> 56:27.409
Hey!
Good boy.

56:27.411 --> 56:28.612
Ha!

56:28.614 --> 56:32.318
We got a big day
tomorrow, butter bones.

56:33.851 --> 56:36.388
Dr. Wendy is coming.

56:43.896 --> 56:47.033
I need you on your
best behavior, buddy.

56:48.534 --> 56:50.003
Yeah.

56:56.507 --> 56:58.243
God, that's disgusting.

57:17.362 --> 57:20.700
Oh, you know that's mommy's
shirt, don't you?

57:27.440 --> 57:29.409
I miss her too, buddy.

58:11.349 --> 58:12.951
Hey, buddy.

58:17.155 --> 58:18.356
What is...

58:19.358 --> 58:20.691
Oh!

58:20.693 --> 58:23.392
You're a bad boy!

58:23.394 --> 58:24.931
Wes!

58:30.436 --> 58:31.437
Okay, okay.

58:51.789 --> 58:53.759
Hey. Come on.

59:12.411 --> 59:13.642
Stay.

59:13.644 --> 59:15.711
Such a bad, bad boy.

59:15.713 --> 59:19.050
Yes, you have. Bad boy.

59:27.324 --> 59:28.393
Oh.

59:35.900 --> 59:38.235
Wes! Wes! Hey, buddy!

59:38.237 --> 59:41.340
Come here! Nudge the door, buddy! Nudge it!

59:42.340 --> 59:43.509
Nudge it!

59:53.851 --> 59:55.418
Mr. Lonnergan!

59:55.420 --> 59:56.586
Hey!

59:56.588 --> 59:58.487
Mr. Lonnergan,
are you okay?

59:58.489 --> 01:00:00.856
Fabulous! Oh, I'm fine.

01:00:00.858 --> 01:00:03.025
Yeah. How are you?

01:00:03.027 --> 01:00:05.430
- Mr. Lonnergan!
- I'll be with you in a minute!

01:00:07.833 --> 01:00:09.902
Why is there smoke?

01:00:11.769 --> 01:00:13.336
Hey, buddy. Yeah.

01:00:13.338 --> 01:00:15.373
I love you too.
Turn the oven off.

01:00:16.708 --> 01:00:18.976
- Something is burning.
- It's the steam from the shower.

01:00:18.978 --> 01:00:20.110
- I'm good.
- Uh-huh.

01:00:20.112 --> 01:00:22.278
It's all good. Yeah.

01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:25.815
- Mr. Lonnergan, we have an appointment right now.
- I'm coming!

01:00:36.128 --> 01:00:37.059
Ah!

01:00:45.070 --> 01:00:47.906
Wes. Hide this.

01:00:53.045 --> 01:00:54.610
Where is she?

01:00:54.612 --> 01:00:56.248
I'm coming!

01:01:01.019 --> 01:01:02.586
Don't go!

01:01:02.588 --> 01:01:04.490
Oh, my God.

01:01:08.626 --> 01:01:11.528
Come on, baby. Come on.
Outside, outside.

01:01:11.530 --> 01:01:13.232
Outside. Good.

01:01:24.675 --> 01:01:27.112
Dr. Wendy.

01:01:29.481 --> 01:01:31.117
Dr. Wendy!

01:01:33.784 --> 01:01:35.519
Hey!

01:01:35.521 --> 01:01:37.156
Dr. Wendy!

01:01:38.056 --> 01:01:39.357
Dr. Wendy.

01:02:06.585 --> 01:02:09.186
Wesley! Hi, baby!

01:02:09.188 --> 01:02:11.387
- Here.
- Oh! What's wrong?

01:02:11.389 --> 01:02:14.858
Well, congratulations
on winning the case.

01:02:14.860 --> 01:02:16.260
What are you
talking about?

01:02:16.262 --> 01:02:19.028
I blew the evaluation.

01:02:19.030 --> 01:02:22.201
It was
a total frickin' disaster.

01:02:23.101 --> 01:02:24.568
Oh, Clay.

01:02:24.570 --> 01:02:26.105
What?

01:02:27.039 --> 01:02:28.274
What?

01:02:29.275 --> 01:02:31.443
You wanna come inside
and have some tea?

01:02:34.346 --> 01:02:35.447
Come on.

01:02:37.516 --> 01:02:38.584
All right.

01:02:40.050 --> 01:02:41.586
Have some tea.

01:02:47.525 --> 01:02:50.061
Well, it's probably
for the best.

01:02:50.896 --> 01:02:52.362
I didn't deserve him.

01:02:52.364 --> 01:02:56.135
- I mean, don't say that.
- What?

01:02:56.802 --> 01:02:58.334
I'm 35 years old

01:02:58.336 --> 01:03:01.639
with a broken body
and a broken life.

01:03:03.175 --> 01:03:04.840
It's awesome.

01:03:04.842 --> 01:03:07.078
Come jump on the Clay train.

01:03:10.815 --> 01:03:12.615
Clay.

01:03:12.617 --> 01:03:16.353
Honey, we could have avoided
this whole mess if I...

01:03:16.355 --> 01:03:19.324
- if I just...
- What?

01:03:22.527 --> 01:03:24.062
What's that?

01:03:25.130 --> 01:03:27.130
Oh. Those are costumes.

01:03:27.132 --> 01:03:28.999
Costumes for what?

01:03:29.001 --> 01:03:31.470
For the festival.

01:03:38.744 --> 01:03:40.312
Really?

01:03:42.514 --> 01:03:47.553
You two are going to the
doggie festival without me?

01:03:49.121 --> 01:03:53.259
I didn't think it would really
make any sense for you to go.

01:03:54.527 --> 01:03:56.659
And Glenn,

01:03:56.661 --> 01:04:01.666
his center's having a demo
and he asked me to help, so...

01:04:04.034 --> 01:04:05.703
Awesome.

01:04:14.945 --> 01:04:18.315
Boys, this is it. First game.
We got a big game tonight.

01:04:18.317 --> 01:04:20.516
Those other guys
are really moving out there.

01:04:20.518 --> 01:04:22.751
I need 110%
from all you guys.

01:04:22.753 --> 01:04:25.655
We're gonna go out there and crush
the Papa John's Wolverines, all right?

01:04:25.657 --> 01:04:27.691
- Yeah!
- Koji, you ready? Koji, hey!

01:04:27.693 --> 01:04:29.825
Koji, keep your head
in the game, all right?

01:04:29.827 --> 01:04:31.528
- You ready to go?
- Yeah.

01:04:31.530 --> 01:04:34.500
You're our tender tonight, buddy.
You're gonna stop some pucks?

01:04:36.068 --> 01:04:38.300
Damn it, Clay.

01:04:38.302 --> 01:04:40.438
Go, Wolf Pack!

01:05:08.634 --> 01:05:11.802
- Hey, Clay, you in here?
- What?

01:05:11.804 --> 01:05:13.873
Dude, open this door.

01:05:15.173 --> 01:05:17.039
You gotta leave me alone.

01:05:17.041 --> 01:05:20.077
Where were you, man?
We just won. Koji was awesome.

01:05:20.079 --> 01:05:22.912
Thanks for showing up, man.
Real nice.

01:05:22.914 --> 01:05:25.447
Well, congratulations.

01:05:25.449 --> 01:05:27.351
Now leave me alone.

01:05:27.353 --> 01:05:31.787
If I didn't know any better, I'd say this
mess in here is a cry for help. Disgusting.

01:05:31.789 --> 01:05:33.222
What's wrong with you?

01:05:33.224 --> 01:05:37.496
Well, this mess
is Clay Lonnergan.

01:05:38.764 --> 01:05:40.597
Wife-less and dog-less.

01:05:40.599 --> 01:05:43.633
What do you mean, "dog-less"?
Where's Wesley?

01:05:43.635 --> 01:05:46.269
Well, look around, man.
This is what the good doctor saw.

01:05:46.271 --> 01:05:48.070
Game over.

01:05:48.072 --> 01:05:51.575
What about that super sweet video
we were making? What about that?

01:05:51.577 --> 01:05:56.582
Oh, that... was
<i>Apocalypse Now</i> with a dog.

01:05:58.817 --> 01:06:03.153
And just to stick
the knife in a little further,

01:06:03.155 --> 01:06:05.521
I find out she's going
to the dog festival.

01:06:05.523 --> 01:06:08.891
I mean, you know that's my
favorite day of the year, man.

01:06:08.893 --> 01:06:13.829
And she's going in a sweet ladybug
outfit and with that tool bag, Glenn.

01:06:13.831 --> 01:06:16.532
Just because Glenn has
literally perfect bone structure

01:06:16.534 --> 01:06:19.267
doesn't mean you need to
give up on this whole thing.

01:06:19.269 --> 01:06:21.606
It's not giving up
if there's no fight.

01:06:24.141 --> 01:06:27.212
The people you love
always leave you.

01:06:28.547 --> 01:06:30.382
Ain't that right, Koji?

01:06:31.615 --> 01:06:32.684
Huh?

01:06:35.086 --> 01:06:38.153
Yeah, you know all about it.

01:06:38.155 --> 01:06:41.891
There's nothing any of us can do about
it, so that's what I'm gonna do.

01:06:41.893 --> 01:06:42.827
Nothing.

01:06:45.063 --> 01:06:49.365
For the last time, the both of
you, get out of here!

01:06:49.367 --> 01:06:52.869
I know you're hurting, but don't you dare
talk to my nephew like that, all right?

01:06:52.871 --> 01:06:55.838
He's nine years old.
Pull it together, man. You're an adult.

01:06:55.840 --> 01:06:57.273
This is embarrassing.

01:06:57.275 --> 01:06:58.777
Let's go, Koj.

01:07:06.251 --> 01:07:10.990
Sometimes you do everything
right, and the puck still goes in.

01:07:13.592 --> 01:07:16.291
I didn't do
everything right though.

01:07:16.293 --> 01:07:18.161
So? Try again.

01:07:18.163 --> 01:07:20.833
Even monkeys
fall from trees.

01:07:34.679 --> 01:07:37.048
Even monkeys fall from trees.

01:07:42.653 --> 01:07:45.824
I think
I really hurt Clay.

01:07:47.224 --> 01:07:50.492
Honey, you both have been at
each other for quite some time.

01:07:50.494 --> 01:07:51.595
- I mean...
- I know.

01:07:51.597 --> 01:07:55.501
- Really?
- Yeah, but I guess...

01:07:57.135 --> 01:07:59.168
But he was so sad

01:07:59.170 --> 01:08:02.771
when he saw that I was going
to the festival without him.

01:08:02.773 --> 01:08:06.543
You know what? I...
I thought he wanted to have a family.

01:08:06.545 --> 01:08:07.844
- He did.
- Right?

01:08:07.846 --> 01:08:09.581
He... He said he did.

01:08:11.248 --> 01:08:13.083
I know he did.

01:08:13.085 --> 01:08:18.788
Then he started to get all weird,
and he started pushing back.

01:08:18.791 --> 01:08:23.225
And... I don't know what
is going on in his head.

01:08:23.228 --> 01:08:25.662
Obviously a lot.

01:08:25.663 --> 01:08:29.298
But, um, if he ever
figures it out,

01:08:29.300 --> 01:08:31.367
he'll make a...

01:08:31.368 --> 01:08:36.072
a great father
to somebody someday.

01:08:36.073 --> 01:08:39.942
That was a good one, but we're gonna
try it again. Get ready. Here we go.

01:08:39.944 --> 01:08:41.376
Oop.

01:08:41.377 --> 01:08:43.245
Rhett, can I have
a word, buddy?

01:08:43.247 --> 01:08:44.849
Yeah, come over
if you wanna talk.

01:08:47.085 --> 01:08:49.720
Whoa, whoa! Whoa!

01:08:50.389 --> 01:08:53.990
I just... I wanna ask.

01:08:53.992 --> 01:08:58.426
Can you forgive me? I'm asking your
forgiveness. Please forgive me.

01:08:58.429 --> 01:09:00.099
You okay, bud?

01:09:01.365 --> 01:09:03.232
I have a plan,
but I need your help.

01:09:03.234 --> 01:09:06.572
I don't suppose either of you
guys has a sewing machine?

01:09:09.875 --> 01:09:11.443
I do.

01:09:12.042 --> 01:09:14.410
You loved me...

01:09:14.412 --> 01:09:16.481
even when I was an ass.

01:09:17.448 --> 01:09:19.716
And I will never forget that.

01:09:20.752 --> 01:09:21.951
Olive,

01:09:21.953 --> 01:09:26.591
you are the wings
to my heaven.

01:09:28.725 --> 01:09:32.228
Wow, dude.

01:09:32.229 --> 01:09:34.196
I didn't know you
had that in you.

01:09:34.198 --> 01:09:36.398
- Neither did I.
- It's so good.

01:09:36.399 --> 01:09:39.435
- Koj?
- Nice job.

01:09:39.438 --> 01:09:41.504
Let's do this.

01:09:41.506 --> 01:09:42.571
Yeah.

01:10:18.408 --> 01:10:20.242
Come see a free demonstration.

01:10:20.244 --> 01:10:24.817
"Lead your Pack and Control your
Misbehaving Pup The Hannon Way."

01:10:25.884 --> 01:10:28.351
Come see
a free demonstration!

01:10:28.353 --> 01:10:33.158
Ooh! "Lead your Pack and Control
your Misbehaving Pup The Hannon Way."

01:10:37.895 --> 01:10:39.928
- Hey, Dolly.
- Hi, Clay. Good to see you.

01:10:39.930 --> 01:10:41.196
Yeah.

01:10:41.198 --> 01:10:42.667
Hi.

01:10:46.070 --> 01:10:48.138
- See a demonstration later.
- I'll check it out.

01:10:48.140 --> 01:10:49.906
Okay.

01:10:49.908 --> 01:10:53.276
Thank you for coming.
Wonderful costume.

01:10:53.278 --> 01:10:54.477
- Suzie.
- Hi!

01:10:54.479 --> 01:10:56.278
- Hey. It's Clay.
- Uh-huh.

01:10:56.280 --> 01:10:58.848
- I need to ask you a really big favor.
- Mm-hmm.

01:10:58.850 --> 01:11:03.419
Your dog is 99.8% wolf,

01:11:03.421 --> 01:11:05.888
and wolves run in packs.

01:11:05.890 --> 01:11:08.991
Any pack leaders here today?

01:11:08.993 --> 01:11:12.928
We're trying to turn you
into pack leaders.

01:11:12.930 --> 01:11:15.498
- I can't wait to read it.
- Enjoy.

01:11:15.500 --> 01:11:17.433
- I'm a hit.
- Good.

01:11:17.435 --> 01:11:20.570
Mind handing out brochures? I gotta go
to the truck for another box of books.

01:11:20.572 --> 01:11:22.839
- Of course.
- All right.

01:11:22.841 --> 01:11:25.777
Uh, are you gonna
wear that all day?

01:11:26.677 --> 01:11:28.378
I was planning on it.

01:11:28.380 --> 01:11:30.278
- I'll be two minutes.
- Okay.

01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:32.781
Stay.
Just kidding.

01:11:43.461 --> 01:11:46.028
Jo-Jo.
Jo-Jo, just stand down.

01:11:46.030 --> 01:11:48.097
Ringo,
give us the floor, man.

01:11:48.099 --> 01:11:51.400
I'm just gonna take over. I cleared
it with Sally. She said it's okay.

01:11:51.402 --> 01:11:54.004
- Okay, cool man.
- Hey... I'm sorry.

01:11:54.006 --> 01:11:57.209
How do you get this...
This cord is so long!

01:11:59.578 --> 01:12:01.246
- Got it.
- Thank you.

01:12:02.314 --> 01:12:04.115
There.

01:12:06.051 --> 01:12:07.416
Olive!

01:12:07.418 --> 01:12:09.018
Dr. Greene.

01:12:09.020 --> 01:12:10.622
Is that Daddy?

01:12:12.489 --> 01:12:15.625
I'm not
the butthead-head you know.

01:12:15.627 --> 01:12:16.826
I'm Bob.

01:12:16.828 --> 01:12:20.996
And, uh... Well, I mean,

01:12:20.998 --> 01:12:25.902
a bee ain't nothing without
honey, and you're my honey.

01:12:25.904 --> 01:12:27.769
I thought you were
gonna hand out brochures.

01:12:27.771 --> 01:12:29.205
- Um...
- I was.

01:12:29.207 --> 01:12:30.873
Well...

01:12:30.875 --> 01:12:34.677
And you loved me even when I
was, well, just an ass,

01:12:34.679 --> 01:12:36.412
and a big one.

01:12:36.414 --> 01:12:39.348
And, uh, I will
never forget that.

01:12:39.350 --> 01:12:40.482
Never.

01:12:40.484 --> 01:12:41.851
- Is that Clay?
- It is.

01:12:41.853 --> 01:12:43.320
You're honey.
You've always been.

01:12:43.322 --> 01:12:45.754
- What the hell is he doing?
- That's right.

01:12:45.756 --> 01:12:47.223
I don't know.

01:12:47.225 --> 01:12:48.924
You're embarrassing yourself.

01:12:48.926 --> 01:12:52.495
You, Olive,
are the wings to my heaven.

01:12:52.497 --> 01:12:54.863
People think
you're my girlfriend.

01:12:54.865 --> 01:12:58.267
You look bad,
I look bad.

01:12:58.269 --> 01:12:59.802
G-Glenn.

01:12:59.804 --> 01:13:02.205
Hey. I look good, right?

01:13:02.207 --> 01:13:05.474
You look great. I mean, this is...
You're killing it.

01:13:05.476 --> 01:13:07.009
She's gonna
love it, right?

01:13:07.011 --> 01:13:08.477
- Good job.
- Thanks, guys.

01:13:08.479 --> 01:13:11.447
Uh, I'm not sure what you're,
uh, trying to do here,

01:13:11.449 --> 01:13:16.452
but I think it's time
for you to see yourself out.

01:13:16.454 --> 01:13:19.621
You know what, Glenn?
I think there's a poodle that needs help.

01:13:19.623 --> 01:13:21.292
You're embarrassing yourself.

01:13:22.159 --> 01:13:23.694
Really?

01:13:27.198 --> 01:13:29.566
Give me a drumroll.

01:13:31.469 --> 01:13:33.602
Ooh!

01:13:33.604 --> 01:13:35.271
Stay down,
Bumblebee Bob.

01:13:35.273 --> 01:13:36.772
Easy does it, bee.

01:13:36.774 --> 01:13:38.842
Come on, Bumble.
Just stay down.

01:13:38.844 --> 01:13:43.012
Man, this is just a couple of grown
men fighting in a dog festival.

01:13:43.014 --> 01:13:46.083
Think we're
on an ice hockey?

01:13:47.452 --> 01:13:49.318
Wesley!

01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:50.919
Wesley! Wesley!

01:13:50.921 --> 01:13:53.490
Sic balls!
Sic balls!

01:13:53.492 --> 01:13:55.724
You guys,
this is not good.

01:13:55.726 --> 01:13:58.126
- Down!
- Come here, Wes! Come here. Come... Wes.

01:13:58.128 --> 01:14:00.929
You want more?
Come... Come on!

01:14:00.931 --> 01:14:02.630
- Who's laughing now?
- You want more?

01:14:02.632 --> 01:14:04.135
What are you doing? Stop!

01:14:04.935 --> 01:14:06.835
Why are you doing this?

01:14:06.837 --> 01:14:09.273
It was the insect
who started it.

01:14:10.876 --> 01:14:13.378
- Guys!
- Olive, what do you think?

01:14:18.416 --> 01:14:19.985
Um...

01:14:22.286 --> 01:14:23.887
You didn't like it?

01:14:23.889 --> 01:14:27.423
You thought this would
make everything okay?

01:14:27.425 --> 01:14:29.291
Well, yeah.

01:14:29.293 --> 01:14:30.996
Oh, my God.

01:14:32.329 --> 01:14:34.932
Zzz. Zzz.

01:14:36.600 --> 01:14:38.769
Cute isn't enough.

01:14:40.037 --> 01:14:43.175
I'm done waiting for you to grow up.
I'm just done.

01:14:53.118 --> 01:14:54.817
Easy come, easy...

01:14:54.819 --> 01:14:56.852
- Oh, God!
- Come on, dude. Let's go.

01:14:56.854 --> 01:14:58.821
- Are you kidding me?
- Dude, come on.

01:14:58.823 --> 01:15:00.792
You stay down there
with your dumb face.

01:15:09.533 --> 01:15:13.902
First Circuit Court of the State of
Illinois, Judge Hutcheon presiding.

01:15:13.904 --> 01:15:16.371
Court is now in session.

01:15:16.373 --> 01:15:19.641
Mr. Lonnergan,
on your final court-appointed visit,

01:15:19.643 --> 01:15:24.345
Dr. Wendy reports that not only was she
unimpressed with your living conditions,

01:15:24.347 --> 01:15:28.819
she found you to be, and I
quote, "a complete lunatic."

01:15:31.689 --> 01:15:35.357
Uh, it was... it was a bad morning.
I'll give her that much.

01:15:35.359 --> 01:15:38.527
Ms. Greene clearly has
the more stable home,

01:15:38.529 --> 01:15:42.264
and this probably would have
been the deciding factor,

01:15:42.266 --> 01:15:45.768
that is until I took a look
at the adoption records.

01:15:45.770 --> 01:15:48.670
Your Honor,
those documents are missing.

01:15:48.672 --> 01:15:53.077
The dog rescue agency
was able to locate a copy.

01:15:54.645 --> 01:15:56.081
Thank you.

01:15:56.881 --> 01:15:58.479
Prior to marriage,

01:15:58.481 --> 01:16:01.282
the adoption records were
signed by Clay Lonnergan.

01:16:01.284 --> 01:16:05.220
That makes Wesley the legal
property of Mr. Lonnergan.

01:16:05.222 --> 01:16:07.757
This is no longer
a custody issue.

01:16:07.759 --> 01:16:10.994
Bailiff, please return
Mr. Lonnergan's property to him.

01:16:10.996 --> 01:16:12.264
Court adjourned.

01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:17.599
That's it?

01:16:17.601 --> 01:16:19.300
I'm sorry, Ms. Greene.

01:16:19.302 --> 01:16:23.673
No, wait. But who makes these laws?
Wesley's property?

01:16:23.675 --> 01:16:25.574
- Ms. Greene.
- I'm sorry.

01:16:25.576 --> 01:16:30.479
When was the last time your car was
happy to see you? Or your couch?

01:16:30.481 --> 01:16:33.950
A piece of property
can't love you back,

01:16:33.952 --> 01:16:39.655
so don't tell me that my dog is
the same as a stupid TV or a lamp,

01:16:39.657 --> 01:16:40.956
because he's not!

01:16:40.958 --> 01:16:42.357
He's not.

01:16:42.359 --> 01:16:43.594
Enough.

01:16:45.729 --> 01:16:47.498
Oh, God.

01:16:56.573 --> 01:16:58.475
Come here.

01:17:00.511 --> 01:17:02.380
Come on, buddy.

01:17:24.202 --> 01:17:26.302
All right, little buddy.

01:17:26.304 --> 01:17:29.074
Daddy's gotta go
to work now, okay?

01:17:33.511 --> 01:17:35.744
Good boy.

01:17:35.746 --> 01:17:38.180
Okay. Look at this.

01:17:38.182 --> 01:17:43.919
Wait. I'm gonna make you
a bed of freshly washed jerseys.

01:17:43.921 --> 01:17:45.687
That one's not so fresh.

01:17:45.689 --> 01:17:47.224
Okay, buddy.

01:17:50.159 --> 01:17:52.162
There you go.

01:17:59.103 --> 01:18:01.970
All right. Come here.

01:18:01.972 --> 01:18:04.643
Seventy minutes
of hell, my friend.

01:18:09.380 --> 01:18:10.916
I love you.

01:18:17.320 --> 01:18:19.522
Hey, Coach. You wanted to see me?

01:18:19.524 --> 01:18:21.656
Lonnergan, come on in.

01:18:21.658 --> 01:18:25.027
I gotta tell you, you've been extremely
impressive these past few weeks.

01:18:25.029 --> 01:18:26.361
I've been trying.

01:18:26.363 --> 01:18:28.132
Longo's out
with a sprained ankle.

01:18:28.932 --> 01:18:30.402
They're calling you up.

01:18:36.372 --> 01:18:38.007
Huh.

01:18:38.009 --> 01:18:40.541
Knock 'em dead, kid.

01:18:40.543 --> 01:18:43.514
I haven't been
called "kid" in a while.

01:18:46.117 --> 01:18:49.418
- Thanks, Coach.
- Good luck to you.

01:18:49.420 --> 01:18:50.355
Huh.

01:19:11.775 --> 01:19:14.112
Rhett, they're calling me up.

01:19:15.878 --> 01:19:17.247
Ah.

01:19:18.849 --> 01:19:19.915
Ah.

01:19:19.917 --> 01:19:21.319
Wes!

01:19:22.319 --> 01:19:23.420
Wesley?

01:19:24.354 --> 01:19:25.622
Wesley!

01:20:04.729 --> 01:20:05.826
Clay?

01:20:05.828 --> 01:20:07.532
Oli.

01:20:08.631 --> 01:20:10.898
Uh...

01:20:10.900 --> 01:20:12.403
I lost Wesley.

01:20:13.537 --> 01:20:14.538
What?

01:20:15.605 --> 01:20:18.741
- I lost Wesley.
- Just tell me where you are.

01:20:18.743 --> 01:20:21.878
I've been looking all night for him.
I just can't find him.

01:20:21.880 --> 01:20:24.412
I'll be mad at you later.
Let's just find our dog.

01:20:24.414 --> 01:20:28.284
Okay, people,
we need to work quickly.

01:20:28.286 --> 01:20:30.753
Let's assume he's
walking at a normal pace.

01:20:30.755 --> 01:20:34.055
In this urban environment,
he could be in an eight-mile radius.

01:20:34.057 --> 01:20:36.858
Uh, he's an approachable,
mid-size dog,

01:20:36.860 --> 01:20:40.028
so that means that he
should be easy to spot.

01:20:40.030 --> 01:20:42.263
We've gotta get
the fliers up fast.

01:20:42.265 --> 01:20:46.168
There are staple guns and tape in my trunk.
Let's go find Wesley.

01:20:46.170 --> 01:20:48.102
All right.

01:20:48.104 --> 01:20:50.940
Let's go.
Come on, guys! Come on!

01:21:06.422 --> 01:21:08.624
I'll just lift you!

01:21:08.626 --> 01:21:09.791
One, two...

01:21:12.497 --> 01:21:14.729
You're almost
as heavy as me, man.

01:21:18.036 --> 01:21:19.802
- Thank you.
- Move on, soldier.

01:21:23.440 --> 01:21:25.844
Bring it in. Beautiful.
Watch your fingers.

01:21:26.610 --> 01:21:27.845
And...

01:21:29.579 --> 01:21:32.246
We gotta go. If we're gonna make
it, we have to leave.

01:21:32.248 --> 01:21:34.116
- Man, I'm not going anywhere, man.
- Dude.

01:21:34.118 --> 01:21:35.483
- I've gotta find my dog.
- Come on!

01:21:35.485 --> 01:21:37.385
Gotta get
all these fliers up.

01:21:37.387 --> 01:21:39.455
We can give 'em
to Olive. Dude.

01:21:39.457 --> 01:21:41.057
- Don't "dude" me.
- God!

01:21:41.059 --> 01:21:42.758
What's going on?

01:21:42.760 --> 01:21:45.361
He got called up. We're not gonna
make it unless we leave now.

01:21:45.363 --> 01:21:48.133
- He got called up?
- Yeah.

01:21:49.934 --> 01:21:51.536
Come on, dude! Let's go!

01:21:55.206 --> 01:21:57.809
Clay, you've gotta go.
You got called up.

01:21:59.243 --> 01:22:01.108
I'm right
where I need to be.

01:22:01.110 --> 01:22:03.445
Yeah, but I've
got this covered, okay?

01:22:03.447 --> 01:22:05.817
This is everything
you've been working for.

01:22:06.885 --> 01:22:07.819
This guy.

01:22:10.253 --> 01:22:13.158
Is that guy
taking down our fliers?

01:22:14.824 --> 01:22:15.894
Why would...

01:22:20.965 --> 01:22:22.432
Come on.

01:22:25.168 --> 01:22:27.702
- Hey!
- Whoa! What?

01:22:27.704 --> 01:22:30.438
Just stay back.
This may get dicey.

01:22:30.440 --> 01:22:32.607
I've lived with you for five years.
I know dicey.

01:22:32.609 --> 01:22:34.809
Why are you giving this to me?

01:22:34.811 --> 01:22:36.648
Ah! Ow!

01:22:40.185 --> 01:22:43.419
- Do you see him?
- Shh, shh. There he is.

01:22:43.421 --> 01:22:45.219
Wes.

01:22:45.221 --> 01:22:47.356
Here, buddy.

01:22:47.358 --> 01:22:48.793
Shh, shh, shh.

01:22:56.699 --> 01:23:00.201
- Wesley, baby!
- Hey, buddy.

01:23:00.203 --> 01:23:02.036
His name is Bandit.
He's my dog!

01:23:02.038 --> 01:23:03.772
Yeah! That's right!

01:23:03.774 --> 01:23:05.241
His name is Bandit.

01:23:05.243 --> 01:23:07.608
His name's Wesley.
It says it on his collar.

01:23:07.610 --> 01:23:09.978
- Get him, Jeb!
- Get outta here!

01:23:09.980 --> 01:23:11.213
Easy, big fella.

01:23:13.149 --> 01:23:14.849
Easy.

01:23:14.851 --> 01:23:16.751
Listen, buddy.

01:23:16.753 --> 01:23:19.454
I'm sure you got
your problems, man.

01:23:19.456 --> 01:23:21.690
Let me tell you, brother.
I got mine.

01:23:21.692 --> 01:23:24.462
But right now,
the only problem I have is you.

01:23:25.962 --> 01:23:28.362
That dog is my life.

01:23:28.364 --> 01:23:30.001
I got nothing
without that dog.

01:23:31.368 --> 01:23:34.503
All right?
So I'm asking,

01:23:34.505 --> 01:23:36.805
one bum to another bum,

01:23:36.807 --> 01:23:39.743
let us... let us take
our boy home.

01:23:42.947 --> 01:23:46.583
And just so you know,
he can bench-press 300 pounds.

01:23:47.518 --> 01:23:50.117
Give or take... 50.

01:23:50.119 --> 01:23:51.452
Baby, do you wanna...

01:23:51.454 --> 01:23:53.321
Thank you.
Thank you.

01:23:53.323 --> 01:23:54.690
Hi, baby.
Come here.

01:23:54.692 --> 01:23:56.327
Whoa, whoa.

01:23:57.962 --> 01:24:01.162
- All right.
- Thank you so much. Let's go!

01:24:01.164 --> 01:24:03.397
- You like hockey?
- I love hockey.

01:24:03.399 --> 01:24:05.267
- Clay!
- Here's 20 bucks.

01:24:05.269 --> 01:24:08.137
You and Gandalf,
go see the wolves.

01:24:08.139 --> 01:24:10.673
I'll probably
just buy crack.

01:24:10.675 --> 01:24:12.441
Wesley, we were
worried about you.

01:24:12.443 --> 01:24:14.076
Buddy,
we gotta go right now.

01:24:14.078 --> 01:24:15.577
- Yeah.
- Come on.

01:24:15.579 --> 01:24:18.347
- We were looking all over for you.
- One second.

01:24:18.349 --> 01:24:19.550
Bye, baby.

01:24:22.185 --> 01:24:24.052
Listen. We could
be gone for a while.

01:24:24.054 --> 01:24:27.391
They don't know how long
Longo's gonna be out for.

01:24:28.391 --> 01:24:30.592
- Okay.
- Yeah.

01:24:30.594 --> 01:24:34.364
- When do you leave?
- Tonight, after the game.

01:24:38.135 --> 01:24:39.835
Take care of Daddy.

01:24:39.837 --> 01:24:42.670
If we don't leave now,
we're gonna miss it. Let's go!

01:24:42.672 --> 01:24:44.540
Go, go, go.
Have a great game.

01:24:44.542 --> 01:24:47.608
I will. Come on!
Race you to the car!

01:24:47.610 --> 01:24:49.210
Go, go, go, go, go!

01:24:49.212 --> 01:24:50.778
Go, go, go!

01:24:50.780 --> 01:24:53.051
My grandma runs faster
than that, Koji.

01:24:54.551 --> 01:24:56.920
Get in the car, Wes.
You too, Koj.

01:24:57.954 --> 01:24:59.990
There you go, buddy.
All right, yeah.

01:25:11.668 --> 01:25:16.071
Clay Lonnergan gets his first
start in goal tonight for the Chicago Wolves

01:25:16.073 --> 01:25:18.940
in front of a sold-out crowd.

01:25:18.942 --> 01:25:22.244
Well, the pressure is on.
He's worked very hard for this.

01:25:22.246 --> 01:25:25.550
He'd love to be the number-one guy.
He has to be very nervous.

01:25:49.774 --> 01:25:52.007
Olive, hey, it's Rhett.

01:25:52.009 --> 01:25:53.174
Come in!

01:25:53.176 --> 01:25:54.375
Hey.

01:25:54.377 --> 01:25:56.144
Why aren't you at the game?

01:25:56.146 --> 01:25:59.315
Shh. Just listen, okay?
I've been doing a lot of thinking,

01:25:59.317 --> 01:26:05.155
and I understand now that our
timing was all wrong, and that...

01:26:06.256 --> 01:26:08.223
Wh... Hang on. Just...

01:26:08.225 --> 01:26:09.790
Are you okay?

01:26:09.792 --> 01:26:13.528
Shut up.
Shut up for a second.

01:26:13.530 --> 01:26:15.563
"I've been thinking
about a lot of things,

01:26:15.565 --> 01:26:18.200
and I understand now
that our timing was all wrong.

01:26:18.202 --> 01:26:21.202
You were ready to start
a family and I wasn't,

01:26:21.204 --> 01:26:25.374
and now I'm ready, but you moved
on, and I have to live with that.

01:26:25.376 --> 01:26:27.342
But it doesn't mean
Wesley should have to.

01:26:27.344 --> 01:26:29.510
I know now
that he needs his mom

01:26:29.512 --> 01:26:31.546
just as much
as he needs his dad.

01:26:31.548 --> 01:26:34.185
And that's why I want..."
Koji! Koji, now!

01:26:35.551 --> 01:26:38.753
"That's why I want you
to always be in his life.

01:26:38.755 --> 01:26:42.190
So forget what the judge said.
He'll always be our dog."

01:26:42.192 --> 01:26:44.125
Um...

01:26:44.127 --> 01:26:46.294
Clay wrote that
in case you were wondering.

01:26:46.296 --> 01:26:49.063
I didn't write those...
I don't feel those things towards you.

01:26:49.065 --> 01:26:52.032
That's how Clay thinks,
and I think we're...

01:26:52.034 --> 01:26:54.535
- I think we're done here, right? Okay.
- You can go.

01:26:54.537 --> 01:26:59.176
See ya. Come on, buddy. You did it.
We gotta go. See ya, Wesley. See ya, Olive.

01:27:01.112 --> 01:27:03.047
Oh, baby.

01:27:37.814 --> 01:27:41.415
Ladies and gentlemen,
here come your Chicago Wolves!

01:27:41.417 --> 01:27:44.586
And the fans have
been waiting for a long time.

01:27:44.588 --> 01:27:46.789
This game,
a lot rides on it.

01:27:46.791 --> 01:27:49.724
First place,
play-off implications

01:27:49.726 --> 01:27:52.963
and the arch rival, Admirals,
just down the street.

01:28:05.176 --> 01:28:07.041
Okay. Let's go.

01:28:07.043 --> 01:28:08.679
Let's go!

01:28:09.979 --> 01:28:12.481
Let's go, Lonnergan. We got your back.

01:28:12.483 --> 01:28:13.717
Bring it in, man.

01:28:24.594 --> 01:28:28.964
Clay Lonnergan gets hit,
and he is down, and that is too bad.

01:28:28.966 --> 01:28:32.334
<i>He has been terrific tonight.</i>

01:28:32.336 --> 01:28:35.504
That might be the best game I've
ever seen you play. Amazing.

01:28:35.506 --> 01:28:38.706
You got your bell rung,
but you're gonna be fine. Right, Koj?

01:28:38.708 --> 01:28:41.076
- Yeah.
- Give him a high five. We gotta take off.

01:28:41.078 --> 01:28:44.146
I'll live to fight another day, man.

01:28:44.148 --> 01:28:47.348
Here we go. All right, buddy.
We'll see you in the waiting room.

01:28:47.350 --> 01:28:49.185
Ready, Koj?
Come on, bud.

01:28:50.619 --> 01:28:52.720
Your X-rays are negative.

01:28:52.722 --> 01:28:55.691
You should be good to go
in a day or so.

01:28:55.693 --> 01:28:57.161
Thanks, Doc.

01:29:01.297 --> 01:29:05.302
Mr. Lonnergan, your doctor
is ready to see you now.

01:29:06.369 --> 01:29:08.271
I just saw the doctor.

01:29:14.578 --> 01:29:16.180
Hi.

01:29:18.148 --> 01:29:19.317
Hi.

01:29:21.650 --> 01:29:24.255
The boys delivered
your message.

01:29:25.454 --> 01:29:28.156
How badly did
they screw it up?

01:29:28.158 --> 01:29:31.329
Well, it was Rhett,
so it was pretty bad.

01:29:33.530 --> 01:29:35.666
That guy.

01:29:36.432 --> 01:29:38.034
But it was perfect.

01:29:40.002 --> 01:29:41.268
Really?

01:29:41.270 --> 01:29:42.806
Mm-hmm.

01:29:45.076 --> 01:29:48.045
- Like perfect, perfect?
- Like perfect, perfect.

01:29:49.779 --> 01:29:53.115
So I was thinking
that there might be a way

01:29:53.117 --> 01:29:55.753
for us to both take care
of Wesley together.

01:29:58.954 --> 01:29:59.923
How?

01:30:05.462 --> 01:30:07.264
Come back home.

01:30:09.899 --> 01:30:11.802
I just have one question.

01:30:15.671 --> 01:30:17.839
Will you...

01:30:17.841 --> 01:30:20.378
stop divorcing me?

01:30:25.882 --> 01:30:28.786
I think I fell back
in love with you just now.

01:30:58.881 --> 01:31:02.817
Now, I know things
haven't been normal lately.

01:31:02.819 --> 01:31:04.486
Then again,
they never are, right?

01:31:06.488 --> 01:31:09.292
There's gonna be a little
transition, but you'll be fine.

01:31:10.528 --> 01:31:12.896
You ready for this,
butter bones?

01:31:14.163 --> 01:31:15.330
Yeah.

01:31:15.332 --> 01:31:17.665
Come here! Come here!
Come. Come on.

01:31:17.667 --> 01:31:20.438
Let's go surprise Mommy.
Let's go.

01:31:21.704 --> 01:31:23.306
Go.

01:31:26.443 --> 01:31:29.510
Wesley, meet Danny.

01:31:29.512 --> 01:31:32.949
Hi, baby. Hi.

01:31:33.882 --> 01:31:35.351
You're a big brother now.

01:31:37.520 --> 01:31:39.456
Ohh.

01:31:40.757 --> 01:31:42.324
Uh-oh.

01:31:44.461 --> 01:31:46.195
He'll get used to it, right?

01:31:46.197 --> 01:31:49.132
Did you hear Wesley?
He said he loves you.
