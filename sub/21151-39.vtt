WE NEED THE STAND ON A TILTING
CLOUD WHILE HOLDING THE TAIL OF

WHOEVER HANGS ON TO THE TAIL THE
LONGEST WINS AND GETS TO ADVANCE

06:10.471 --> 06:22.716
TO PART THREE OF THE FINAL
H.O.H. COMPETITION.

06:22.750 --> 06:24.284
THAT WAS AGGRESSIVE.

06:24.317 --> 06:26.920
>> WHOA, SOMEBODY HAD BROCCOLI.

06:26.954 --> 06:29.823
>> I BROKE MY FOOT WEEK TWO
COMING INTO THE "BIG BROTHER"

06:29.857 --> 06:33.160
HOUSE, AND I'VE HAD TO SIT OUT
ON A LOT OF PHYSICAL

06:33.193 --> 06:36.997
COMPETITIONS, SO GOING INTO THIS
LAST H.O.H., I AM PUMPED BECAUSE

06:37.030 --> 06:41.168
I FINALLY GET TO COMPETE, AND
THE TIMING COULDN'T BE BETTER.

06:41.201 --> 06:43.937
I NEED TO WIN THIS FIRST PART OF
THE H.O.H., NOT ONLY THE PROVE I

06:43.971 --> 06:47.207

THE THIRD PART OF THE H.O.H.

06:49.743 --> 06:52.245
COMPETITION.

06:52.279 --> 06:56.249
>> AT THIS POINT IN THE GAME,
I'VE BEEN THINKING REALLY HARD

06:56.283 --> 06:59.620
WHO I WANT THE TAKE THE FINAL
TWO, AND I'VE BEEN THINKING ALL

06:59.653 --> 07:02.856
ALONG IT'S CHRISTMAS, BUT THE
OTHER NIGHT PAUL GAVE ME A GOOD

07:02.890 --> 07:05.526
CHASE FOR WHY WE SHOULD SIT NEXT
TO EACH OTHER IN FINAL TWO.

07:05.559 --> 07:12.232
>> I'M TELLING YOU, BOTH OF US
LOSE NEXT TO HER.

07:12.265 --> 07:15.903
>> SHE HASN'T PISSED ANYBODY
OFF.

07:15.936 --> 07:22.109
>> US NEXT TO EACH OTHER,
THEY'LL BE LIKE...

07:22.142 --> 07:26.346
>> BUT I'M NOT SOLD YET, BECAUSE
I WANT TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THE

07:26.379 --> 07:30.518
DECISION THAT'S BEST FOR MY GAME
AT THE END, SO I NEED TO WIN THE

07:30.551 --> 07:31.051
H.O.H.

07:31.084 --> 07:33.787
>> MY BEARD IS PISSED.

07:33.821 --> 07:34.788
I'M PISSED.

07:34.822 --> 07:40.828
THIS UNICORN IS CLEARLY PISSED.

07:40.861 --> 07:43.263
LOOK, I'VE HAD PEOPLE THROWING
COMPETITIONS ALL SEASON LONG,

07:43.296 --> 07:46.099
AND I'VE PROBABLY THROWN A FEW
MYSELF, BUT NOW IT'S TIME TO

07:46.133 --> 07:47.267
WIN.

07:47.300 --> 07:50.971
IF I WIN THIS H.O.H., I SECURE
MY SPOT IN PART THREE OF THE

07:51.004 --> 07:59.179
FINAL H.O.H. AND I'M ONE STEP
CLOSER TO THAT $500,000.

07:59.212 --> 08:00.113
THANKS.

08:00.147 --> 08:05.318
>> THE PONY POOPED.

08:05.352 --> 08:12.092
THESE UNICORN POOPS ARE PRETTY
BAD, BUT IT'S NOT AS BAD AS

08:12.125 --> 08:13.060
JOSH.

08:13.093 --> 08:19.166
>> WHY DOES IT SMELL LIKE HE
JUST FARTED ON ME?

08:19.199 --> 08:23.170
>> OKAY.

08:23.203 --> 08:28.208
MY CLOUD DECIDES TO KIND OF TILT
BACK, AN MY FOOT IS PISSED OFF

08:28.241 --> 08:35.215
AT ME.

08:35.248 --> 08:39.119
I HAVEN'T USED MY FOOT AS AN
EXCUSE ALL SUMMER LONG, AND

08:39.152 --> 08:41.254
THERE'S IN WAY I'M GOING TO
START DOING THAT NOW.

08:41.288 --> 08:46.894
SO I HAVE TO SUCK IT UP, HOLD ON
TO THAT UNICORN TAIL, AND WIN

08:46.927 --> 08:53.000
THIS COMPETITION.

08:53.033 --> 08:56.036
ALL RIGHT.

08:56.069 --> 08:58.205
I DON'T LIKE RIDING UNICORNS
ANYMORE.

08:58.238 --> 09:01.474
>> I'M DYING.

09:01.508 --> 09:03.043
I'M HOLDING ON FOR DEAR LIFE.

09:03.076 --> 09:07.514
MY LEGS ARE TREMBLING, MY ARMS
ARE LOCKING UP, EVERYTHING IS

09:07.547 --> 09:13.787
SORE, EVERYTHING IS IN PAIN.

09:13.821 --> 09:17.057
GUYS, I'M DYING.

09:17.090 --> 09:18.558
>> COME ON.

09:18.592 --> 09:20.360
COME ON, JOSH.

09:20.393 --> 09:24.497
COME ON.

09:24.531 --> 09:30.838
>> I'M EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED IN

09:30.871 --> 09:32.005
MYSELF.

09:32.039 --> 09:34.574
I WAS HOLDING ON FOR DEAR LIFE,
AND I JUST COULDN'T DO IT.

09:34.608 --> 09:38.211
I WANTED TO WIN THIS ONE IN
ORDER TO SECURE MY SPOT IN THAT

09:38.245 --> 09:40.347
THIRD H.O.H. COMPETITION.

09:40.380 --> 09:46.720
SUCKS.

09:46.754 --> 09:52.292
>> HERE WE GO AGAIN.

09:52.325 --> 09:56.563
>> WELL, JOSH GOES DOWN FIRST,
AND CHRISTMAS IS LOCKED IN

09:56.596 --> 09:58.331
TIGHT.

09:58.365 --> 10:04.304
I GOT TO HANG ON TO THIS UNICORN
TAIL AS HARD AS I CAN, OR THAT

10:04.337 --> 10:06.106
500,000 IS SLIPPING THROUGH MY
FINGERS.

10:06.139 --> 10:09.409
>> HOLY COW.

10:09.442 --> 10:15.515
WAY TOO STEEP FOR MY
APPRECIATION.

10:15.548 --> 10:20.587
OH, MY GOSH.

10:20.620 --> 10:21.554
MY BODY IS JEEPING.

10:21.588 --> 10:23.290
MY FOOT IS PISSED.

10:23.323 --> 10:24.424
MY HANDS ARE GOING NUMB.

10:24.457 --> 10:30.497
THAT SHOULDER IS... IF THIS
UNICORN TAIL KEEPS GROWING,

10:30.530 --> 10:33.767
ADDING SLACK TO THE ROPE AND
MAKING IT SO MUCH MORE DIFFICULT

10:33.801 --> 10:42.575
TO HOLD ON.

10:52.552 --> 10:54.621
>> THAT WAS CLOSE.

10:54.654 --> 10:57.557
I REALLY GOT TO PULL THROUGH
HERE, BECAUSE IF I DON'T WIN

10:57.590 --> 11:02.029
THIS COMPETITION, I MIGHT JUST
SINK MY CHANCES OF BEING IN THE

11:02.062 --> 11:11.238
FINAL TWO.

11:11.271 --> 11:13.473
NO, NO, NO, NO.

11:13.506 --> 11:16.944
OH, OH.

11:16.977 --> 11:19.212
>> WHOA.

11:19.246 --> 11:20.347
YES!

11:20.380 --> 11:28.055
YES!

11:28.088 --> 11:33.727
OH, MY GOD, I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

11:33.761 --> 11:37.330
>> I CAN'T EVEN FEEL MY HANDS.

11:37.364 --> 11:39.399
>> YOU ARE A BEAST.

11:39.432 --> 11:40.567
I'M IN SHOCK.

11:40.600 --> 11:43.636
I'VE WORKED REALLY HARD THIS
SEASON AND PUT EVERY OUNCE OF

11:43.670 --> 11:49.342
BLOOD AND SWEAT AND TEARS INTO
THIS GAME, AND I'M ONLY ONE

11:49.376 --> 11:53.480
COMPETITION AWAY FROM A SPOT IN
THE FINAL TWO.

11:53.513 --> 11:58.819
>> GIVE ME A HUG.

11:58.852 --> 12:02.389
>> THAT WAS PROBABLY ONE OF THE
HARDEST FALLS I'VE EVER TAKEN IN

12:02.422 --> 12:08.929
MY LIFE BECAUSE I JUST... I
REALLY WANTED IT.

12:08.962 --> 12:10.130
>> YOU KILLED IT.

12:10.163 --> 12:13.200
>> BUT I KNOW THERE'S ONE MORE
TO COME, AND I'M GOING TO GIVE

12:13.233 --> 12:14.467
IT ALL MY HEART.

12:14.501 --> 12:17.204
AND I HOPE THAT ALL OF MY HEART
NEXT TIME IS ENOUGH TO TAKE HOME

12:17.237 --> 12:18.839
THE WIN.

12:18.872 --> 12:19.572
I'M SO PISSED.

12:19.606 --> 12:21.775
I CAN'T EVEN GRIP MY HANDS.

12:21.809 --> 12:24.511
>> FROM THE MOMENT I STOOD UP
THERE.

12:24.544 --> 12:26.947
NOW IT'S GOING TO BE ME AND
CHRISTMAS FACING OFF IN THE

12:26.980 --> 12:29.049
SECOND ROUND OF THE H.O.H.

12:29.082 --> 12:30.217
COMPETITION.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.485
IT SUCKS THAT I HAVE TO COMPETE
AGAINST HER, BUT I NEED TO

12:32.519 --> 12:33.921
SECURE MY SPOT IN THE THIRD
ROUND.

12:33.954 --> 12:38.291
SO I'M SORRY, CHRISTMAS, I LOVE
YOU, BUT I NEED TO WIN THIS NEXT

I WALK INTO THE BACKYARD, AND I

13:52.866 --> 13:56.169
AND I'M LOOKING AT ALL OF THE
EVICTED HOUSEGUESTS.

13:56.203 --> 14:01.341
I'M NOT SURE WHAT'S HAPPENING,
BUT I AM READY TO GET MEDIEVAL.

14:01.374 --> 14:04.111
WELCOME TO PART TWO OF THE FINAL
HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD COMPETITION.

14:04.144 --> 14:06.813
THE WINNER WILL FACE OFF AGAINST
PAUL IN PART THREE FOR THE

14:06.846 --> 14:10.350

EACH SCROLL WILL TELL YOU WHICH
EVICTED HOUSEGUEST YOU NEED TO

14:24.431 --> 14:27.067
WITH YOUR JOB IS TO ATTACK
ANYONE YOU'RE NOT ALIGNED WITH

14:27.100 --> 14:31.504

WHEN YOU THINK THAT ONLY
HOUSEGUEST THAT FIT THAT TROLL'S

14:36.576 --> 14:40.313
DESCRIPTION ARE LEFT STANDING,
HIT YOUR BUZZER.

14:40.347 --> 14:43.750

WILL APPEAR ON THE MONITOR AND
YOU MUST RESET ALL EVICTED

14:47.687 --> 14:50.223
HOUSEGUESTS TO THEIR UPRIGHT
POSITIONS.

14:50.257 --> 14:54.294
THE PLAYER WHO ANSWERS THE THREE
SCROLLS CORRECTLY AND HITS THEIR

14:54.327 --> 14:57.730
BUTTON IN THE FASTEST TIME WILL
WIN PART TWO OF THIS THREE-PART

14:57.764 --> 14:58.932
HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD COMPETITION.

14:58.966 --> 15:00.500
LET'S GO.

15:00.533 --> 15:06.106
ALIGN YOURSELF WITH THE EVICTED
HOUSEGUESTS THAT HAVE WON H.O.H.

15:06.139 --> 15:08.808
I NEED TO WIN THIS COMPETITION
TO SHOW EVERYBODY THAT EVEN WITH

15:08.841 --> 15:13.513
A BROKEN FOOT I AM A COMPETITOR
TO BE RECKONED WITH.

15:13.546 --> 15:17.684
AND IT WILL PUT ME ONE STEP
CLOSER TO THAT $500,000 PRIZE.

15:17.717 --> 15:20.853
FIRST QUESTION IS PRETTY EASY.

15:20.887 --> 15:25.225
CODY, JESSICA, JASON, AND ALEX
HAVE ALL BEEN H.O.H.s.

15:25.258 --> 15:31.631
I SO I HAVE TO KNOCK DOWN
EVERYBODY ELSE.

15:31.664 --> 15:32.665
BYE, MARK.

15:32.699 --> 15:34.267
OH, NO.

15:34.301 --> 15:36.669
SORRY, CODY, I'M GOING TO HAVE
TO STAND YOU BACK UP.

15:36.703 --> 15:39.506
I HIT CODY BY ACCIDENT, SO I
HAVE TO FIX THAT BEFORE I BUZZ

15:39.539 --> 15:42.809
IN.

15:42.842 --> 15:43.310
YEAH.

15:43.343 --> 15:44.477
COME ON.

15:44.511 --> 15:48.148
SOME OF THESE HOUSEGUESTS I
WON'T BE ABLE TO HIT WITH JUST

15:48.181 --> 15:51.218
THE CROSSBOW, SO I HAVE THE USE
ALL THREE WEAPONS TO GET A CLEAR

15:51.251 --> 15:53.386
SHOT AT EACH OF MY TARGET.

15:53.420 --> 15:57.557
DOMINIQUE.

15:57.590 --> 16:00.960
BYE.

16:00.994 --> 16:05.598
BYE.

16:05.632 --> 16:09.169
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.

16:09.202 --> 16:10.303
REALLY?

16:10.337 --> 16:12.739
I KNOCKED DOWN JESSICA WHEN I
MEANT TO KNOCK DOWN KEVIN.

16:12.772 --> 16:16.576
NOW I HAVE TO FIX THAT ONE, TOO.

16:16.609 --> 16:19.646
GOOD.

16:19.679 --> 16:24.617
I'VE SHOT ALL MY HOUSEGUESTS,
AND I HAD TO GO AND STAND UP

16:24.651 --> 16:31.391
CODY AND JESSs BEFORE I BUZZ
IN AND HOPE THAT I'M CORRECT.

16:31.424 --> 16:34.661
ALIGN YOURSELF WITH THE EVICTED

16:34.694 --> 16:37.764
HOUSEGUESTS THAT WERE TAKEN OFF
THE BLOCK WITH THE POWER OF

16:37.797 --> 16:38.765
VETO.

16:38.798 --> 16:41.000
>> I DECIDED TO USE THE POWER OF
VETO ON MYSELF.

16:41.034 --> 16:43.370
>> I'VE DECIDED TO USE THE POWER
OF VETO ON MYSELF.

16:43.403 --> 16:45.605
>> I'M USING THE VETO ON MYSELF.

16:45.638 --> 16:49.342
>> I KNOW MARK, ALEX AND JASON
WERE ALL TAKEN OFF THE BLOCK

16:49.376 --> 16:50.643
WITH THE POWER OF VETO.

16:50.677 --> 16:53.713
I HAVE TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE THE
ONLY ONES LEFT STANDING.

16:53.746 --> 17:01.221
ALL RIGHT.

17:01.254 --> 17:05.125
I KNOW MATT WAS ON THE BLOCK
WHEN HE WON THE VETO, BUT I

17:05.158 --> 17:06.826
CANNOT REMEMBER WHAT HE DID WITH
IT.

17:06.859 --> 17:10.197
>> I HAVE DECIDED TO USE THE
POWER OF VETO ON YOU.

17:10.230 --> 17:12.632
>> EXTREME!

17:12.665 --> 17:19.306
>> I'M GUESSING THAT HE USED IT
ON HIS RIDE OR DIE, RAVEN.

17:19.339 --> 17:23.643
I'M GOING TO KNOCK DOWN MATT AND
HEAVE RAVEN STANDING.

17:23.676 --> 17:29.716
NOW I'M THINKING MAYBE HE USED
IT ON HIMSELF, SO I'M GOING TO

17:29.749 --> 17:32.719
PICK UP MATT AND LEAVE RAVEN
DOWN.

17:32.752 --> 17:34.387
I HATE MY LIFE RIGHT NOW.

17:34.421 --> 17:37.757
CLEARLY HE DIDN'T SAVE HIMSELF
OR RAVEN.

17:37.790 --> 17:41.761
SO I'M GOING TO KNOCK BOTH OF
THEM DOWN THIS TIME AND SEE WHAT

17:41.794 --> 17:44.731
HAPPENS.

17:44.764 --> 17:47.467
ALIGN YOURSELF WITH THE EVICTED
HOUSEGUESTS THAT WERE ON THE

17:47.500 --> 17:49.802
BLOCK ON EVICTION NIGHT THREE OR
MORE TIMES.

17:49.836 --> 17:53.806
I KNOW JESSICA, CODY, MATT,
KEVIN, ALAINA, AND RAVEN WERE

17:53.840 --> 17:56.609
ALL ON THE BLOCK THREE TIMES OR
MORE ON EVICTION NIGHT.

17:56.643 --> 18:00.347
NOW ALL I HAVE TO DO IS KNOCK
OUT THE OTHER HOUSEGUESTS AS

18:00.380 --> 18:03.350
FAST AS I POSSIBLY CAN AND
HOPEFULLY MY TIME IS FASTER THAN

18:03.383 --> 18:04.617
JOSH'S.

18:04.651 --> 18:11.090
NO!

18:11.124 --> 18:15.528
DANG IT.

18:15.562 --> 18:21.634
OH.

18:21.668 --> 18:24.971
THE FRUSTRATING PART ABOUT THIS
IS I KNOW THE ANSWER, BUT I KEEP

18:25.004 --> 18:31.077
KNOCKING DOWN THE WRONG
HOUSEGUESTS.

18:31.110 --> 18:33.146
MY MIND IS SCRAMBLED.

18:33.180 --> 18:35.148
MY HEART HURTS BECAUSE OF
DISAPPOINTMENT.

18:35.182 --> 18:49.729
I AM JUST AT A LOSS IN THIS
MOMENT.

18:49.762 --> 18:53.300
I'M FRUSTRATED WITH MY

18:53.333 --> 18:55.602
PERFORMANCE BECAUSE I THINK I
COULD HAVE DONE BETTER, BUT AT

18:55.635 --> 18:58.571
THIS POINT I'M HOPING THAT I DO
A LITTLE BETTER THAN JOSH AND

18:58.605 --> 19:04.544
MOVE ON TO THAT THIRD PART OF
THE H.O.H.

19:04.577 --> 19:08.080
>> ALIGN YOURSELF WITH THE
EVICTED HOUSEGUESTS THAT HAVE

19:08.114 --> 19:09.349
WON H.O.H.

19:09.382 --> 19:11.918
SO IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT FOR
ME TO WIN PART TWO OF THIS HEAD

19:11.951 --> 19:13.085
OF HOUSEHOLD.

19:13.119 --> 19:15.522
I'VE GOTTEN THIS FAR, AND I'M IN
THE LEAVING IT IN NO ONE'S

19:15.555 --> 19:16.756
HANDS.

19:16.789 --> 19:19.326
I WANT TO MAKE SURE I MAKE IT TO
ROUND THREE AND I HAVE CONTROL

19:19.359 --> 19:24.797
OF MY BESTNY MOVING FORWARD IN
THIS GAME.

19:24.831 --> 19:26.399
-- DESTINY MOVING FORWARD IN
THIS GAME.

19:26.433 --> 19:29.336
I KNOW ALL THE EVICTED
HOUSEGUESTS THAT WON H.O.H.

19:29.369 --> 19:32.505
BECAUSE THEY WERE THE POWER
COUPLES, JESSICA AND CODY, AND

19:32.539 --> 19:33.440
ALEX AND JASON.

19:33.473 --> 19:43.516
NOW I HAVE TO KNOCK OVER
EVERYBODY ELSE.

19:43.516 --> 19:48.521
NOW I HAVE TO KNOCK OVER
EVERYBODY ELSE.

19:48.555 --> 19:53.993
I'M USING THIS SLINGSHOT, AND
I'M LOVING IT.

19:54.026 --> 19:59.131
HEY, MOMMY, DO YOU THINK I CAN
GET ONE OF THESE AT HOME?

19:59.165 --> 20:04.937
SO I GOT TO GO RUN DOWN AND PUT
THIS MEATBALL BACK UP.

20:04.971 --> 20:07.574
COME ON!

20:07.607 --> 20:14.113
JOSH, GET YOUR HEAD IN THE GAME.

20:14.146 --> 20:16.048
YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.

20:16.082 --> 20:30.297
WHY DO I KEEP HITTING JESS AND
CODY?

20:30.330 --> 20:35.167
ALIGN YOURSELF WITH THE EVICTED

20:35.201 --> 20:37.637
HOUSEGUESTS THAT WERE TAKEN OFF
THE BLOCK WITH THE POWER OF

20:37.670 --> 20:38.605
VETO.

20:38.638 --> 20:41.608
>>I KNOW NOBODY USED THE POWER O
VETO ON CODY.

20:41.641 --> 20:45.645
MATT WAS ON THE BLOCK FOUR TIME,
SO NOBODY USED IT ON HIM.

20:45.678 --> 20:47.580
THERE WE GO.

20:47.614 --> 20:50.617
SO I KNOW FOR SURE THAT ALEX AND
MARK WERE SAVED WITH THE VETO.

20:50.650 --> 20:53.820
I CAN'T THINK OF ANYBODY ELSE,
BUT I'M GOING TO HAVE TO START

20:53.853 --> 21:03.963
KNOCKING DOWN THESE MEATBALLS IF
I WANT TO WIN THIS ROUND.

21:03.963 --> 21:10.202
KNOCKING DOWN THESE MEATBALLS IF
I WANT TO WIN THIS ROUND.

21:10.236 --> 21:13.005
I'M LOOKING AT JASON, AND I
TRIED TO REMEMBER, I THINK

21:13.039 --> 21:23.516
SOMEONE EITHER USED THE VETO ON
HIM OR HE USED IT ON HIMSELF.

21:23.550 --> 21:28.455
ALIGN YOURSELF WITH THE EVICTED

21:28.488 --> 21:30.790
HOUSEGUESTS THAT WERE ON THE
BLOCK ON EVICTION NIGHT THREE OR

21:30.823 --> 21:31.624
MORE TIMES.

21:31.658 --> 21:32.792
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

21:32.825 --> 21:34.361
I'M LOST IN THE SAUCE.

21:34.394 --> 21:38.064
SO I'M GOING TO DO A PROCESS OF
ELIMINATION AND START KNOCKING

21:38.097 --> 21:40.266
DOWN HOUSEGUESTS THAT I DON'T
REMEMBER BEING ON THE BLOCK A

21:40.299 --> 21:41.401
LOT.

21:41.434 --> 21:46.539
DOMINIQUE, OKAY.

21:51.411 --> 21:56.115
OH.

21:56.148 --> 21:58.851
MY GIRL JILLIAN, SHE WASN'T EVEN
HERE PAST WEEK TWO.

21:58.885 --> 22:05.758
NO WAY SHE WAS ON THE BLOCK
THREE OR MORE TIMES.

22:05.792 --> 22:06.626
JILLIAN, WHY.

22:06.659 --> 22:08.294
WHY YOU GIVE ME SUCH HARD TIME,
JILLIAN.

22:08.327 --> 22:10.129
WE WERE FRIENDS, JILLIAN.

22:10.162 --> 22:24.644
WE SPOKE ABOUT TIJUANA.

22:24.677 --> 22:26.646
BOOM, I HEAR THE BUZZER.

22:26.679 --> 22:31.150
NOW I'M GETTING REALLY NERVOUS
BECAUSE I KNOW CLOCK IS TICKING.

22:31.183 --> 22:34.721
I REMEMBER KEVIN AND ALAINA
BEING ON THE BLOCK SEVERAL

22:34.754 --> 22:39.692
TIMES, SO I NEED THE MAKE SURE
THEY'RE ALL STANDING.

22:39.726 --> 22:42.895
JESSICA WAS ON THE BLOCK A LOT

22:42.929 --> 22:45.131
AND CODY WAS BECAUSE WE WERE
TRYING TO GET THEM OUT FOR

22:45.164 --> 22:47.033
WEEKS.

22:47.066 --> 22:51.571
ALEX AND JASON WERE KIND OF

22:51.604 --> 22:52.839
SITTING PRETTY UNTIL THE END.

22:52.872 --> 22:57.043
I'M THINKING THEY WEREN'T ON THE
BLOCK THAT MUCH, SO I'M GOING TO

22:57.076 --> 23:05.652
KNOCK THEM DOWN.

23:05.685 --> 23:08.655
FINALLY I FINISHED
QUESTION THREE, AND TO BE

23:08.688 --> 23:09.922
HONEST, I DON'T FEEL SO GOOD
ABOUT IT.

23:09.956 --> 23:11.758
I HAVE NO IDEA HOW CHRISTMAS
DID.

23:11.791 --> 23:14.627
ALL I CAN HOPE IS THAT I GOT A
GOOD ENOUGH TIME THE BEAT HER

23:14.661 --> 23:18.665
SCORE AND MOVE ON TO ROUND
THREE.

23:18.698 --> 23:26.606
>> ALL RIGHT, CHRISTMAS, YOU
FINISHED WITH A TIME OF ONE HOUR

23:26.639 --> 23:28.374
AND 39 MINUTES.

23:28.407 --> 23:32.945
>> OH, MY GOSH, YOU BEAT ME.

23:32.979 --> 23:36.215
>> ALL RIGHT, JOSH, LET'S SEE IF
YOU CAN BEAT ONE HOUR AND 39

23:36.248 --> 23:43.055
MINUTES.

23:43.089 --> 23:44.290
WOW.

23:44.323 --> 23:48.260
JOSH, YOU GOT ONE HOUR AND 32
MINUTES, CONGRATULATIONS, JOSH.

23:48.294 --> 23:53.933
YOU WON H.O.H. PART TWO, AND YOU
GET TO BE IN H.O.H. PART THREE.

23:53.966 --> 23:54.433
WOW.

23:54.467 --> 23:56.869
GOOD JOB, YOU TWO.

23:56.903 --> 23:59.972
>> I'M PRETTY DISAPPOINTED IN MY
PERFORMANCE WITH THIS

24:00.006 --> 24:01.207
COMPETITION.

24:01.240 --> 24:05.277
I WAS REALLY HOPING TO SECURE MY
SPOT IN THE FINAL TWO WITHOUT

24:05.311 --> 24:06.913
HAVING SOMEBODY TAKE ME.

24:06.946 --> 24:10.617
>> OH, MY GOD.

24:10.650 --> 24:11.851
CRAZY.

24:11.884 --> 24:14.286
IT'S SO CRAZY FOR ME TO THINK I
MADE IT THIS FAR IN THE GAME.

24:14.320 --> 24:16.689
I AM THIS CLOSE AND I CAN
LITERALLY TASTE IT.

24:16.723 --> 24:20.359
I CAN SEE THE $500,000 CHECK
SIGNED TO MY NAME.

24:20.392 --> 24:33.372
>> WOW.

24:33.405 --> 24:34.841
>> WHAT IS UP?

24:34.874 --> 24:35.875
I'M LEGIT IN SHOCK.

24:35.908 --> 24:38.711
I SECURED MYSELF A SPOT IN THE
END OF THE GAME.

24:38.745 --> 24:45.351
BECAUSE IN THAT LAST COMP, IF I
FOR SOME CHANCE LOSE, JOSH SAYS

24:45.384 --> 24:46.953
HE'S STILL GOING TO PULL ME UP.

24:46.986 --> 24:50.590
LAST YEAR I WAS ONE VOTE SHY OF
WINNING AND IT WAS

24:50.623 --> 24:53.092
HEARTBREAKING, BUT THIS YEAR I'M
PRETTY SURE I HAVE JOSH BEAT,

24:53.125 --> 24:55.662
AND THE PEOPLE SITTING IN THE
JURY HOUSE DON'T LIKE ME, BUT I

24:55.695 --> 24:56.863
DEFINITELY KNOW THEY DON'T LIKE
JOSH.

24:56.896 --> 24:59.732
AND IF I CAN ACTUALLY WIN FIRST
PLACE THIS TIME AND GET THAT

24:59.766 --> 25:03.202
MONEY, I CAN TAKE IT BACK THE MY
FAMILY, RELEASE ANY FINANCIAL

25:03.235 --> 25:06.773
BURDENS THAT THEY HAVE, AND PUT
THE REST BACK INTO MYSELF, MY

25:06.806 --> 25:09.709
FUTURE, AND HOPEFULLY I GET TO
SPREAD THE WORD OF FRIENDSHIP

25:09.742 --> 25:10.509
EVEN MORE.

25:10.543 --> 25:18.317
I THINK I MIGHT ACTUALLY WIN,
GUYS.

25:18.350 --> 25:21.453
>> SUPER DISAPPOINTED IN MY
PERFORMANCE.

25:21.487 --> 25:22.154
I FAILED.

25:22.188 --> 25:24.824
I SUCKED AT THAT COMPETITION.

25:24.857 --> 25:30.262
I'VE WORKED SO HARD, AND I HAVE
TRIED SO HARD TO STAY POSITIVE,

25:30.296 --> 25:33.600
AND TO SHOW PEOPLE THAT YOU CAN
THIS WHATEVER YOU PUT YOUR MIND

25:33.633 --> 25:37.503
TO, EVEN PLAY "BIG BROTHER" WITH
A BROKEN FOOT.

25:37.536 --> 25:40.840
I HONESTLY DON'T THINK THAT
ANYBODY ELSE WOULD HAVE PLAYED

25:40.873 --> 25:44.176
WITH A BROKEN FOOT, SO DOES THAT
MAKE ME EXCEPTIONAL, OR DOES

25:44.210 --> 25:47.346
THAT MAKE ME THE GIRL THAT GOT
CARRIED THROUGH BECAUSE SHE HAS

25:47.379 --> 25:48.815
A BROKEN FOOT?

25:48.848 --> 25:53.786
WHEN I THINK ABOUT BEING IN THE
FINAL TWO, IT OVERWHELMS ME WITH

25:53.820 --> 25:58.157
EXCITEMENT, BECAUSE MY MOM HAS
ALWAYS BEEN MY HERO, AND SHE WAS

25:58.190 --> 25:59.391
DIAGNOSED WITH BREAST CANCER.

25:59.425 --> 26:02.929
SO NOW I WANT TO BE ABLE TO GIVE
BACK TO HER BY HELPING HER PAY

26:02.962 --> 26:06.633
FOR SOME OF THE REMAINING
MEDICAL BILLS, BUT ALSO BUY HER

26:06.666 --> 26:12.238
A LITTLE LOG CABIN ON HER FARM
DOWN IN TEXAS.

26:12.271 --> 26:19.846
AND WHO DOESN'T WANT TO BUY
THEIR MOM A HOUSE?

26:19.879 --> 26:24.216
>> HOLA, FAMILIA.

26:24.250 --> 26:25.151
I'M IN THE FINAL THREE.

26:25.184 --> 26:28.187
I MADE IT ALL THE WAY TO FINALE
NIGHT.

26:28.220 --> 26:29.221
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

26:29.255 --> 26:31.758
I DON'T KNOW WHO BELIEVES IT,
BUT IT'S HAPPENING.

26:31.791 --> 26:33.960
WINNING "BIG BROTHER" HAS BEEN
MY DREAM SINCE I WAS 14 YEARS

26:33.993 --> 26:35.227
OLD.

26:35.261 --> 26:37.964
NOW ALL I GOT TO DO IS WIN THAT
FINAL H.O.H. SO I CAN DECIDE WHO

26:37.997 --> 26:41.834
TO BRING WITH ME TO FINAL TWO SO
I HAVE A BETTER CHANCE AT

26:41.868 --> 26:44.170
WINNING THAT $500,000.

26:44.203 --> 26:49.041
WHEN IT COMES TO THE END, I
DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO DO.

26:49.075 --> 26:52.645
I DON'T KNOW IF I'M GOING TO
TAKE CHRISTMAS OR IF I'M GOING

26:52.679 --> 26:56.649
TO TAKE PAUL.

26:56.683 --> 27:02.421
I THINK IF I MAKE A BIG MOVE AND
GET PAUL OUT, PEOPLE WILL BE

27:02.454 --> 27:05.624
LIKE, THAT WOULD BE THE MOVE
THAT WOULD BRING MY GAME FULL

27:05.658 --> 27:06.458
CIRCLE.

27:06.492 --> 27:09.796
I LOVE PAUL, BUT I PLAY FOR MY
FAMILY.

27:09.829 --> 27:12.198
MY FAMILY CAME FROM CUBA WITH
THE AMERICAN DREAM, LITERALLY

27:12.231 --> 27:13.465
CAME FROM NOTHING.

27:13.499 --> 27:15.935
ALL THE HARD WORK THEY'VE BEEN
THROUGH AND ALL THE SWEAT AND

27:15.968 --> 27:17.203
ALL THE STRUGGLES.

27:17.236 --> 27:21.507
IF I CAN WIN THIS MONEY AND SAY
TO MY MOM AND DAD, THANK YOU FOR

27:21.540 --> 27:28.380
ALL YOU'VE DONE FOR ME, MY LIFE
IS COMPLETE.

27:28.414 --> 27:32.051
I'LL BE THE HAPPIEST 23-YEAR-OLD
IN THE WORLD.

27:32.084 --> 27:34.887
I GOT TO WIN TOMORROW.

27:34.921 --> 27:38.424
I'M GUNNING FOR IT.

27:38.457 --> 27:42.161
>> Julie: UP NEXT, BLIND

27:42.194 --> 27:47.366
SIDED, BACK STABBED, AND BITTER,
THE JURORS COME TOGETHER TO

27:47.399 --> 27:48.567
DISCUSS THE FINAL THREE.

27:48.600 --> 27:51.904
BUT FIRST, WE'LL BE BACK AGAIN
NEXT SUMMER, AND WE'RE LOOKING

27:51.938 --> 27:55.107
FOR THE NEXT GROUP OF
HOUSEGUESTS.

27:55.141 --> 28:05.084
>> Announcer: OUTGOING,
OUTSPOKEN --

28:05.117 --> 28:06.385
>> GO ON.

28:06.418 --> 28:08.821
>> Announcer: -- OUTRAGEOUS.

28:08.855 --> 28:12.759
THE SEARCH IS ON FOR THE NEXT
"BIG BROTHER" HOUSEGUESTS.

28:12.792 --> 28:14.660
>> EXTREMETARD.

28:14.693 --> 28:18.030
>> Announcer: DO YOU HAVE TO
MOVE IN AND COMPETE IN A

28:18.064 --> 28:20.666
THREE-MONTH POWER STRUGGLE FOR
$500,000?

28:20.699 --> 28:22.668
>> I LIVE IN AN INSANE ASYLUM.

28:22.701 --> 28:24.703
>> GO TO CBS.COM FOR DETAILS.

28:39.718 --> 28:40.619
>> Julie: WELCOME BACK TO THE

28:40.652 --> 28:42.755
TWO-HOUR SEASON FINALE OF "BIG
BROTHER."

28:42.789 --> 28:46.325
ONE BY ONE EACH JURY MEMBER
ENTERED THE JURY HOUSE AND

28:46.358 --> 28:47.994
REALIZED THEY'D BEEN PLAYED.

28:48.027 --> 28:50.362
AND WITH EMOTIONS RUNNING HIGH,
THEY GATHER TO LEARN WHO WOULD

28:50.396 --> 28:54.500
BE THE NEXT TO JOIN THEM AND
THEN TO VOICE THEIR OPINIONS OF

28:54.533 --> 28:57.703
THE FINAL THREE.

28:57.736 --> 28:59.305
>> MY NAME IS DR. WILL.

28:59.338 --> 29:02.708
I AM A FORMER "BIG BROTHER"
WINNER, BUT I AM ALSO A FORMER

29:02.741 --> 29:05.244
TONIGHT WE'LL DISCUSS THE FINAL
THREE HOUSEGUESTS AND WHAT THEY

29:05.277 --> 29:07.179
DID TO BE WHERE THEY ARE
TONIGHT.

29:07.213 --> 29:09.448
BUT WE CAN'T DISCUSS THE FINAL
THREE UNTIL WE KNOW WHO THE

29:09.481 --> 29:11.951
FINAL THREE ARE, SO WITH NO
FURTHER ADIEU, LET'S GET INTO

29:11.984 --> 29:14.720
IT.

29:14.753 --> 29:15.922
WHO DO YOU THINK WILL BE JOINING
US TONIGHT?

29:15.955 --> 29:16.688
>> KEVIN.

29:16.722 --> 29:17.924
>> WHY DO YOU THINK THAT?

29:17.957 --> 29:21.027
>> HE'S MORE LIKABLE THAN THE
REST OF THEM.

29:21.060 --> 29:22.394
>> OH, MY GOD.

29:22.428 --> 29:23.329
I AGREE WITH THAT.

29:23.362 --> 29:24.663
>> ABSOLUTELY KEVIN.

29:24.696 --> 29:28.200
>> I WOULD LOVE TO SEE JOSH WALK
THROUGH THE DOORS, BUT I'M

29:28.234 --> 29:29.135
THINKING IT'S GOING TO BE
CHRISTMAS.

29:29.168 --> 29:30.236
>> WE HOPE IT'S CHRISTMAS.

29:30.269 --> 29:32.038
>> CHRISTMAS, 110%.

29:32.071 --> 29:35.241
>> IF I COULD BREAK HER OTHER
LEG, I WOULD.

29:35.274 --> 29:37.676
>> WELL, LET'S FIND OUT WHO JURY

29:37.709 --> 29:42.714
NUMBER EIGHT IS.

29:44.951 --> 29:49.455
>> KEVIN!

29:49.488 --> 29:51.423
>> KEVIN, WELCOME TO THE JURY.

29:51.457 --> 29:54.426
>> HEY, I LIKE THE SUIT.

29:54.460 --> 29:55.061
>> THANK YOU.

29:55.094 --> 29:55.995
>> HOW ARE YOU?

29:56.028 --> 29:57.563
>> GOOD, HOW ARE YOU?

29:57.596 --> 30:00.232
>> I KNEW IT WAS GOING TO BE
KEVIN.

30:00.266 --> 30:03.970
>> YOU SAID CHRISTMAS?

30:04.003 --> 30:07.006
THAT JUST DEFINES THE PUPPET
MASTER ALREADY.

30:07.039 --> 30:08.240
YOU'RE SULKING ALREADY.

30:08.274 --> 30:10.009
THE INCREDIBLE SULK HAS STARTED
ALREADY.

30:10.042 --> 30:11.143
>> I KNOW.

30:11.177 --> 30:14.613
>> MATT, NAME THREE THINGS YOU
WERE KNOWN FOR THIS SUMNER

30:14.646 --> 30:16.282
YOU'RE THE INCREDIBLE SULKER.

30:16.315 --> 30:18.617
>> DOES ANYBODY HAVE CEREAL FOR
YOU, MATT?

30:18.650 --> 30:19.618
YOU DID ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.

30:19.651 --> 30:21.921
>> THAT WORKS FOR ME.

30:21.954 --> 30:24.190
>> YOU'RE PROUD OF THAT.

30:24.223 --> 30:25.391
THAT'S PATHETIC, MATT.

30:25.424 --> 30:28.727
NO, NO, NO, BUT HOW ARE YOU A
PUPPET MASTER IF YOU CAME IN

30:28.760 --> 30:29.761
SIXTH PLACE?

30:29.795 --> 30:32.831
>> MARK, YOU HIT THE JURY HOUSE
WAY BEFORE I DID.

30:32.865 --> 30:35.267
>> I NEVER SAID I WAS A GREAT
PLAYER.

30:35.301 --> 30:35.968
>> SIT DOWN.

30:36.002 --> 30:38.070
>> I AM SITTING DOWN, MATT.

30:38.104 --> 30:40.572
MATT, YOU DID ABSOLUTELY NOTHING
IN THE GRAHAM.

30:40.606 --> 30:42.641
COME UP WITH SOMETHING NEW,
MATT.

30:42.674 --> 30:43.542
YOU WERE IRRELEVANT.

30:43.575 --> 30:44.944
>> ABSOLUTELY, BRO.

30:44.977 --> 30:45.811
>> OKAY.

30:45.844 --> 30:46.478
OKAY.

30:46.512 --> 30:48.180
>> KEVIN, WELCOME TO THE JURY.

30:48.214 --> 30:49.248
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

30:49.281 --> 30:50.282
>> HEY, KEVIN.

30:50.316 --> 30:51.884
>> GLAD TO HAVE YOU.

30:51.918 --> 30:52.718
TELL US WHAT HAPPENED?

30:52.751 --> 30:55.454
>> MORE HAPPENED HERE THAN
THERE.

30:55.487 --> 30:57.356
THERE'S ONLY FOUR OF US LEFT.

30:57.389 --> 30:59.058
PAUL WAS THE H.O.H.

30:59.091 --> 31:00.726
HE PUT JOSH AND ME ON THE BLOCK.

31:00.759 --> 31:03.229
PAUL WINS POV.

31:03.262 --> 31:07.066
HE DIDN'T TAKE ME OFF, THAT WAS
THE PLAN TO TAKE ME OFF, I GOT

31:07.099 --> 31:07.866
PRIZED AND I'M HERE.

31:07.900 --> 31:08.834
>> OH, WEIRD.

31:08.867 --> 31:10.702
>> WHOSE VOTE SENT YOU OUT THE
DOOR.

31:10.736 --> 31:14.140
>> CHRISTMAS, SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO
GO INTO THE ROOM, SHE VOTED ME

31:14.173 --> 31:15.341
OUT RIGHT THERE.

31:15.374 --> 31:18.177
>> WHY DID YOU NOT SCREAM AT
PAUL AND WHY ARE YOU NOT MAD AT

31:18.210 --> 31:20.079
HIM WHEN IT'S OBVIOUS HE SCREWED
YOU?

31:20.112 --> 31:22.281
>> DO WHAT, GET UP THERE IN
FRONT OF...

31:22.314 --> 31:24.116
>> I WANT YOU TO KNOCK HIS TEETH
OUT.

31:24.150 --> 31:26.652
>> I'M NOT THAT TYPE OF PERSON,
JASON.

31:26.685 --> 31:29.621
>> NOW THAT WE KNOW WHAT
HAPPENED LET'S GET BACK INTO IT.

31:29.655 --> 31:30.689
LET'S DISCUSS JOSH.

31:30.722 --> 31:33.892
>> FROM THE GET-GO, I THINK
PEOPLE SAW THAT JOSH WAS

31:33.926 --> 31:36.963
EMOTIONALLY UNSTABLE, AND THEY
USE THAT TO THEIR BENEFIT.

31:36.996 --> 31:39.398
I THINK THE REASON HE'S THERE IS
HONESTLY PURE LUCK.

31:39.431 --> 31:41.000
I DON'T THINK HE PLAYED THE BEST
GAME.

31:41.033 --> 31:42.234
>> SAME HERE.

31:42.268 --> 31:45.671
I MEAN, HE JUST USED WHAT HE HAD
TO AND WAS LOUD AND OBNOXIOUS

31:45.704 --> 31:47.739
AND AGGRESSIVE, AND THEN HE
WOUND POUT AND CRY.

31:47.773 --> 31:50.977
>> I DON'T RESPECT JOSH AS A
DUDE.

31:51.010 --> 31:51.377
IN GENERAL.

31:51.410 --> 31:52.244
>> OKAY.

31:52.278 --> 31:53.445
>> OVERALL.

31:53.479 --> 31:57.549
JOSH REALIZED THAT HIS ROLE WAS
TO BE LIKE A NON-VIOLENT

31:57.583 --> 32:00.852
PSYCHOPATH THAT WAS EXTREMELY
EMOTIONAL.

32:00.886 --> 32:04.923
I DON'T WANT TO REWARD BAD
BEHAVIOR.

32:04.957 --> 32:07.193
HE JUST HAD BAD BEHAVIOR THE
ENTIRE TIME.

32:07.226 --> 32:09.061
>> I DON'T RESPECT JOSH AS A
HUMAN BEING.

32:09.095 --> 32:11.830
I THINK THE ONLY THING THAT HE'S
DONE IN THE "BIG BROTHER" GAME

32:11.863 --> 32:12.999
IS EXISTED.

32:13.032 --> 32:14.800
>> CODY, CAN JOSH WIN THE GAME?

32:14.833 --> 32:20.172
>> I MEAN, I THINK PAUL AND JOSH
ARE BOTH SCUM, BUT AT LEAST JOSH

32:20.206 --> 32:25.111
TOOK ACTION, WHILE PAUL WAS
BEHIND A CLOSED DOOR BEING A

32:25.144 --> 32:25.477
WUSS.

32:25.511 --> 32:26.678
>> TRUE.

32:26.712 --> 32:29.315
EVEN IF HE CRIED AFTER THE FACT,
HE WOULD SAY WHAT HE FELT TO

32:29.348 --> 32:30.549
YOUR FACE.

32:30.582 --> 32:32.618
ANYONE WHO CAN FIGHT WITH EVERY
PERSON IN THE HOUSE AND STILL

32:32.651 --> 32:34.486
MAKE FINAL THREE IS PRETTY
IMPRESSIVE.

32:34.520 --> 32:35.521
>> AGREED.

32:35.554 --> 32:38.557
JOSH IS WILLING TO DO WHATEVER
IT TAKES TO WIN.

32:38.590 --> 32:40.626
HE DIDN'T MIND RUINING HIS
SOCIAL GAME.

32:40.659 --> 32:42.194
HE WANTED TO GET TO THE END AND
HE DID.

32:42.228 --> 32:44.630
>> FAIR ENOUGH.

32:44.663 --> 32:47.399
SO GUYS, WHY DOES CHRISTMAS
DESERVE TO WIN THE GAME?

32:47.433 --> 32:48.934
>> THAT'S A GOOD YES.

32:48.967 --> 32:49.968
I MAY ASK YOU THAT.

32:50.002 --> 32:50.436
I DON'T KNOW.

32:50.469 --> 32:51.370
I HAVE NO IDEA.

32:51.403 --> 32:52.604
SHE'S IN THE TOP THREE.

32:52.638 --> 32:55.441
SHE BROKE HER FOOT AND THE ANGLE
THAT SHE USED AND SHE'S THERE.

32:55.474 --> 32:56.442
>> THAT'S TRUE.

32:56.475 --> 32:57.709
THEY CARRIED HER ALONG.

32:57.743 --> 32:59.945
I GUESS FOR ME CHRISTMAS GETS
THE CRIPPLE PASS.

32:59.978 --> 33:02.281
>> I THINK THAT'S THE ONLY
REASON SHE'S IN THE HOUSE.

33:02.314 --> 33:05.717
YOU KNOW WHAT, IF JASON BROKE MY
FOOT, I WOULD PROBABLY STILL BE

33:05.751 --> 33:07.553
SITTING IN THE HOUSE, AND I
WOULDN'T BE MAD ABOUT IT.

33:07.586 --> 33:11.957
>> CHRISTMAS' BIGGEST MOVE IS
THAT JASON BROKE HER FOOT?

33:11.990 --> 33:15.061
>> YEAH, SHE TOOK A TRAGEDY AND
TURNED IT INTO A TRIUMPH

33:15.094 --> 33:15.794
BASICALLY.

33:15.827 --> 33:17.063
PRETTY SIMPLE.

33:17.096 --> 33:19.498
>> ONCE SHE REALIZED THAT NOBODY
WANTED TO USE HER FOR HER BODY,

33:19.531 --> 33:21.067
SHE HAD TO SWITCH TO A SOCIAL
GAME.

33:21.100 --> 33:25.171
>> I THOUGHT SHE WANTED TO TAKE
ME TO FINAL FOUR AND I GOT

33:25.204 --> 33:26.772
EVICTED, SO SHE'S PLAYING GOOD
SOCIAL GAME.

33:26.805 --> 33:27.573
SHE'S THERE.

33:27.606 --> 33:28.407
WE'RE ALL HERE.

33:28.440 --> 33:29.708
SO SHE HAS TO BE DOING SOMETHING
RIGHT.

33:29.741 --> 33:33.245
>> I THINK HER BEST GAME MOVE
WAS ALIGNING WITH JOSH, BECAUSE

33:33.279 --> 33:35.981
WHEN YOUR ALLIANCE MEMBER IS
ALWAYS THE BIGGEST TARGET, HELPS

33:36.014 --> 33:38.084
YOU OUT.

33:38.117 --> 33:42.154
>> GUYS, WHY SHOULD PAUL WIN THE
GAME?

33:42.188 --> 33:44.556
>> PAUL'S A VETERAN.

33:44.590 --> 33:45.924
HE'S A CLEVER LITTLE PLAYER.

33:45.957 --> 33:47.025
HE MANIPULATED EVERYBODY.

33:47.059 --> 33:49.295
AND HE OUTSMARTED EVERYBODY
HERE.

33:49.328 --> 33:52.098
AND IF IT'S A GAME OF
OUTSMARTING, I SAY PAUL SHOULD

33:52.131 --> 33:53.299
DEFINITELY WIN.

33:53.332 --> 33:55.101
>> PAUL MADE IT TO THE FINAL
THREE WITHOUT GOING ON THE BLOCK

33:55.134 --> 33:56.068
A SINGLE TIME.

33:56.102 --> 33:57.769
THE ONLY OTHER PLAYER TO EVER DO
THAT IS DEREK.

33:57.803 --> 34:02.040
>> BUT HE HAD THIS GAME SERVED
UP ON A SILVER PLATTER.

34:02.074 --> 34:05.911
HE WAS ABLE TO PLAY WITH THREE
WEEKS OF SAFETY.

34:05.944 --> 34:08.247
>> YOU BENEFITED FROM THE
HALTING HEX.

34:08.280 --> 34:09.115
>> BARELY.

34:09.148 --> 34:11.450
>> I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH OF AN
ADVANTAGE.

34:11.483 --> 34:14.920
>> THERE WERE TEN OR 11 WEEKS
AFTER OF HIM GETTING SAFETY.

34:14.953 --> 34:17.989
>> MANY, MANY MORE EVICTION,
MANY, MANY MORE OPPORTUNITIES,

34:18.023 --> 34:19.958
AND YET THEY WEREN'T TAKEN.

34:19.991 --> 34:21.193
>> CORRECT.

34:21.227 --> 34:23.829
IF I HAD WON AN H.O.H. AND NOT
BEEN EVICTED, I WOULD HAVE TAKEN

34:23.862 --> 34:26.832
A SHOT AT PAUL, BUT PAUL
ELIMINATED THE PEOPLE THAT

34:26.865 --> 34:29.901
CHALLENGED HIM THE MOST, THAT HE
FEARED THEIR INTELLIGENCE, THAT

34:29.935 --> 34:32.037
HE WAS AFRAID COULD ACTUALLY GO
AFTER HIM.

34:32.070 --> 34:32.871
>> THAT'S THE GAME.

34:32.904 --> 34:34.640
>> YOU DON'T THINK THAT'S
IMPRESSIVE.

34:34.673 --> 34:36.675
HE WANTED EVERYBODY ELSE TO DO
THE DIRTY WORK.

34:36.708 --> 34:39.345
>> HE DIDN'T ACCOUNT FOR PEOPLE
IN THE JURY HOUSE TALKING ABOUT,

34:39.378 --> 34:42.681
OH, YOU HAD A FINAL THREE WITH
HIM SINCE WEEK THREE, SO DID WE,

34:42.714 --> 34:43.882
IT WAS OVERPLAYING.

34:43.915 --> 34:46.618
>> THERE'S A NUMBER OF DUOS ON
THE STAGE TONIGHT, AND YOU ALL

34:46.652 --> 34:48.554
WOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE FINAL
THREE WITH PAUL, CORRECT?

34:48.587 --> 34:49.121
>> YES.

34:49.155 --> 34:49.588
>> YEAH.

34:49.621 --> 34:50.689
>> YES.

34:50.722 --> 34:52.258
>> YOU WOULD HAVE NOT BEEN IN
THE FINAL THREE OF PAUL?

34:52.291 --> 34:55.327
>> WE REALIZED THAT HIS REAL
ALLIANCE IS HIMSELF.

34:55.361 --> 34:57.829
IT DIDN'T MATTER WHO HE
BACKSTABBED OR WHO HE LIED ON.

34:57.863 --> 35:00.466
HE JUST EXECUTED WHATEVER SERVED
PAUL.

35:00.499 --> 35:01.733
>> IT'S "BIG BROTHER."

35:01.767 --> 35:02.868
WE ALL LIED.

35:02.901 --> 35:04.970
>> PAUL WAS TELLING ME ALL
SEASON THAT HE'S GOING TO KEEP

35:05.003 --> 35:06.172
ME AND PLAY WITH ME.

35:06.205 --> 35:08.807
>> DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY TIMES HE
GOT IN MY EAR TO CONVINCE ME

35:08.840 --> 35:09.908
THAT YOU WERE COUNTERFEIT.

35:09.941 --> 35:11.877
>> IT CAN'T BE TOO MUCH
COUNTERFEIT.

35:11.910 --> 35:12.911
>> STILL COUNTERFEIT.

35:12.944 --> 35:14.146
YOU JUST GOT PLAYED.

35:14.180 --> 35:16.648
>> HE DID THAT WITH EVERYONE AND
TRIED TO TURN OUR DUOS AGAINST

35:16.682 --> 35:20.686
EACH OTHER, BACKSTABBED US, LIED
TO US, MANIPULATED US, WHICH

35:20.719 --> 35:23.121
SOME WOULD SAY THAT'S HOW YOU
SAY BIG BROARK AND THAT'S FINE,

35:23.155 --> 35:26.392
BUT THERE IS SUCH A THING AS
BITTER JURORS.

35:26.425 --> 35:27.726
>> SO POOR JURY MANAGEMENT?

35:27.759 --> 35:29.195
>> VERY POOR JURY MANAGEMENT.

35:29.228 --> 35:30.829
>> I THINK HE OVERPLAYED.

35:30.862 --> 35:32.664
I THINK HE ABUSED RELATIONSHIPS.

35:32.698 --> 35:36.902
>> HE'S TRYING TO MAKE IT
PERSONAL BY MAKING SURE EVERY

35:36.935 --> 35:38.036
PLAYER FEELS BELITTLED.

35:38.069 --> 35:39.137
I THINK IT'S BAD GAME PLAY.

35:39.171 --> 35:42.073
>> HE DID THINGS THAT WERE
HURTFUL AND CROSSED THE LINE

35:42.107 --> 35:43.675
THAT I AM DETERMINING AS A JURY
MEMBER.

35:43.709 --> 35:46.077
>> HE OVERLIED.

35:46.111 --> 35:46.845
IT WAS UNCALLED FOR.

35:46.878 --> 35:49.014
>> THAT'S PART OF THE GAME.

35:49.047 --> 35:53.452
>> PLEASE RAISE YOUR HAND IF YOU
LIED OR BACKSTABBED ANYONE IN

35:53.485 --> 35:55.321
THE IN THE "BIG BROTHER" HOUSE?

35:55.354 --> 35:57.155
>> I LIED ONCE OR TWICE.

35:57.189 --> 35:58.490
>> WHO DID WE BACKSTAB?

35:58.524 --> 36:02.394
>> ALEX, YOU RELUCTANTLY PUT UP
YOUR HAND, BUT ADMITTEDLY, THERE

36:02.428 --> 36:04.496
WAS SOME BACKSTABBING OR LYING
OR BLOOND SIDING.

36:04.530 --> 36:06.665
>> WHO DID I BACKSTAB AND BLIND
SIDE?

36:06.698 --> 36:10.369
>> WHO WERE THE PEOPLE EVICTED
PRIOR TO YOU?

36:10.402 --> 36:12.838
SO YOU DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO
DO WITH THOSE BLINDSIDES?

36:12.871 --> 36:14.005
>> YOU SAID LIE.

36:14.039 --> 36:14.606
I DIDN'T LIE TO ANYONE.

36:14.640 --> 36:16.174
>> IS FAKE CRYING LYING?

36:16.208 --> 36:17.709
>> I DON'T THINK SO.

36:17.743 --> 36:22.113
>> DID YOU SAY

36:22.147 --> 36:24.450
>> YEAH, JOSH WAS GOING TO PLAY
ME.

36:24.483 --> 36:26.552
I GUESS I LIED TO JOSH BY YOUR
STANDARD.

36:26.585 --> 36:29.288
>> SHE JUST NEVER LIED TO
SOMEBODY'S FACE, POINT BLANK.

36:29.321 --> 36:32.424
>> PAUL WAS IN MY FACE, DAY
AFTER DAY, MARK, I HAVE YOUR

36:32.458 --> 36:33.459
BACK.

36:33.492 --> 36:35.827
THEN HE'S GOING TO JASON, WE GOT
TO GEDDRY OF MARK.

36:35.861 --> 36:37.463
THERE IS NO NEED FOR THAT.

36:37.496 --> 36:42.701
>> ARE WE PLAYING BIG BABY?

36:42.734 --> 36:47.072
YES, WE'RE ALL SALTY, BECAUSE
WE'RE HERE, AND WE'RE NOT THERE.

36:47.105 --> 36:55.213
BUT BETWEEN CHRISTMAS AND JOSH,
PAUL DESERVES TO WIN THIS GAME.

36:55.247 --> 36:56.415
EVERYONE HERE...

36:56.448 --> 36:59.017
>> PAUL TRICKED EVERY SINGLE
PERSON SITTING HERE, EXCEPT FOR

36:59.050 --> 36:59.618
CODY.

36:59.651 --> 37:01.086
>> HE PLAYED A GOOD GAME.

37:01.119 --> 37:03.589
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO LIE AND
MANIPULATE AND MAKE PEOPLE THINK

37:03.622 --> 37:06.091
YOU'RE ON YOUR SIDE AND BACKSTAB
THEM AND SEND THEM HOME.

37:06.124 --> 37:09.661
>> AN HE TRICKED ME TOO, BUT
NOBODY IS GOING TO TELL ME THAT

37:09.695 --> 37:12.364
JOSH AND CHRISTMAS PLAYED A
BETTER GAME THAN PAUL, NOT IN A

37:12.398 --> 37:13.799
MILLION YEARS.

37:13.832 --> 37:16.868
>> SO, GUYS, THE FINAL THREE
HOUSEGUESTS ARE STILL IN THE

37:16.902 --> 37:19.271
HOUSE AND YOU'RE NOT, SO CLEARLY
THEY DID SOMETHING RIGHT, YET

37:19.305 --> 37:22.140
NONE OF YOU GUYS HAVE GIVEN THE
FINAL THREE ANY REAL CREDIT FOR

37:22.173 --> 37:23.342
MAKING IT.

37:23.375 --> 37:25.511
I GUESS YOU'RE GIVING PAUL SOME
CREDIT, BUT NO ONE IS GIVING

37:25.544 --> 37:26.378
ANYONE ELSE OTHER CREDIT.

37:26.412 --> 37:28.847
>> I SEE HOW PAUL MADE IT TO
FINAL THREE.

37:28.880 --> 37:32.284
I THINK THE OTHER TWO PEOPLE ARE
IN FINAL THREE BECAUSE THEY ARE

37:32.318 --> 37:33.452
NON-THREATS.

37:33.485 --> 37:35.153
>> I DON'T RESPECT HOW THIS
SEASON PLAYED OUT AND I DON'T

37:35.186 --> 37:35.921
RESPECT THE STRATEGY.

37:35.954 --> 37:37.956
>> ARE YOU GUYS JUST SORE
LOSERS?

37:37.989 --> 37:40.158
>> WE CAN ALL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT.

37:40.191 --> 37:44.229
ARE FINAL THREE HOUSEGUESTS ARE
BETTER THAN ALL OF YOU?

37:44.262 --> 37:46.598
>> I'M ABSOLUTELY A SORE LOSER.

37:46.632 --> 37:48.434
>> THANK YOU FOR YOUR HONESTY.

37:48.467 --> 37:50.536
>> IT TAKES HARD WORK AND
PASSION.

37:50.569 --> 37:52.003
THAT'S HOW I'M JUDGING THE
PEOPLE THAT ARE THERE.

37:52.037 --> 37:58.644
>> WHAT DID JOSH OR CHRISTMAS DO
TO SHOW US THEY WORKED HARD AT

37:58.677 --> 37:59.311
THE GAME?

37:59.345 --> 38:00.546
>> JOSH FOUGHT WITH EVERYONE.

38:00.579 --> 38:03.882
>> HE FOUGHT WITH POTS AND PAN,
THAT WAS HIS BIGGEST ASSET TO

38:03.915 --> 38:04.983
THE GAME.

38:05.016 --> 38:07.118
>> I DON'T KNOW THAT I EVER SAID
PAUL DIDN'T WORK HARD.

38:07.152 --> 38:08.487
I DON'T RESPECT THE WAY HE
WORKED.

38:08.520 --> 38:10.522
>> DID JOSH AND CHRISTMAS HARD?

38:10.556 --> 38:11.590
JOSH, YES, CHRISTMAS,.

38:11.623 --> 38:13.258
NO
>> I DISAGREE WITH THAT.

38:13.291 --> 38:16.395
ANYONE WHO CAN GO WITH SURGERY
AND HAVE TO RECOVER IN A HOUSE,

38:16.428 --> 38:20.766
I HAVE HAD EIGHT SURGERIES --
>> OH, MY GOD.

38:20.799 --> 38:25.270
>> HEY, RAVEN, YOU HAVE TO GO IN
A HOUSE AND STAY WITH PEOPLE

38:25.303 --> 38:27.138
FIGHTING, THAT MADE A LOT OF
MENTAL CAPACITY.

38:27.172 --> 38:29.708
>> SHE MADE THE CHOICE TO STAY
IN THE HOUSE.

38:29.741 --> 38:32.077
IF SHE FELT SHE COULDN'T
COMPETE, SHE SHOULDN'T HAVE

38:32.110 --> 38:32.778
STAYED IN THE HOUSE.

38:32.811 --> 38:34.880
>> JASON, HARD WORK AND PASSION.

38:34.913 --> 38:36.081
>> ALL THREE FIT THE BILL.

38:36.114 --> 38:38.917
>> SO ALL THREE ARE REASONABLE
OPTIONS TO WIN "BIG BROTHER"?

38:38.950 --> 38:42.688
>> I THINK THEY'RE FOR SURE OUR
ONLY OPTIONS.

38:42.721 --> 38:45.023
>> OF COURSE THEY'RE THE ONLY
OPTIONS.

38:45.056 --> 38:50.996
>> YOU HAVE TO PICK ONE OF THE
FINAL THREE.

38:51.029 --> 38:54.099
>> SO, GUYS, WE DON'T KNOW WHO
THE FINAL TWO HOUSEGUESTS ARE

38:54.132 --> 38:55.367
GOING TO BE.

38:55.401 --> 38:57.202
AS A JURY, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
THE OPPORTUNITY TO QUESTION THE

38:57.235 --> 38:58.470

LIVE, TWO-HOUR SEASON ANY FAMILY

47:06.224 --> 47:07.425
OF "BIG BROTHER."

47:07.458 --> 47:12.030
JUST MINUTES AGO JOSH BECAME THE
FINAL HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD OF THE

47:12.063 --> 47:13.131
SUMMER.

47:13.164 --> 47:15.700
NOW HE MUST CHOOSE TO EVICT
EITHER PAUL OR CHRISTMAS,

47:15.733 --> 47:18.136
AUTOMATICALLY ENSURING THE
REMAINING HOUSEGUEST A SPOT IN

47:18.169 --> 47:21.806

47:21.839 --> 47:25.076
LET'S HEAD TO THE LIVING ROOM
FOR T MOST IMPORTANT EVICTION

47:25.110 --> 47:28.446
OF THE GAME.

47:28.479 --> 47:32.217
PAUL, CHRISTMAS, IN JUST A FEW
MOMENTS JOSH WILL CAST HIS VOTE

47:32.250 --> 47:37.322
TO EVICT, BUT BEFORE HE DOES,
YOU EACH HAVE ONE LAST CHANCE TO

47:37.355 --> 47:39.324
PLEAD YOUR CASE.

47:39.357 --> 47:41.226
PAUL, YOU'RE UP FIRST.

47:41.259 --> 47:45.196
>> JOSH, BUDDY, YOU SHOOK MY
HAND ON DAY ONE, I'VE WORKED

47:45.230 --> 47:47.732
REALLY HARD BESIDE YOU IN THE
BEGINNING OF THE GAME, AND I

47:47.765 --> 47:50.835
THINK I'VE HAD YOUR BACK A LOT
OF TIMES IN THIS GAME, I'VE KEPT

47:50.868 --> 47:53.571
YOU SAFE WHEN I NEEDED TO, AND I
HOPE YOU CAN KEEP ME SAFE IN

47:53.604 --> 47:54.072
THIS MOMENT.

47:54.105 --> 47:56.274
THANK YOU, BUD.

47:56.307 --> 47:58.709
>> Julie: THANK YOU, PAUL.

47:58.743 --> 47:59.210
CHRISTMAS?

47:59.244 --> 48:02.147
>> THANKS, JULIE.

48:02.180 --> 48:07.118
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY, JOSH,
YOU'RE MY MEATBALL.

48:07.152 --> 48:09.988
PAUL, YOU'RE FRIENDSHIP PAUL,
AND I LOVE BOTH OF YOU, SO I

48:10.021 --> 48:12.623
JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR
AN AMAZING SUMMER.

48:12.657 --> 48:17.828
I'VE HAD THE TIME OF MY LIFE,
AND I HONESTLY AM WALKING OUT OF

48:17.862 --> 48:20.898
HERE WITH SO MANY THINGS THAT I
DIDN'T EXPECT TO GAIN, LIKE SO

48:20.932 --> 48:24.702
MANY FRIENDSHIPS AND AN
EXPERIENCE THATLY NEVER BE ABLE

48:24.735 --> 48:28.106
TO RELIVE AGAIN, SO I WANT TO
THANK BOTH OF YOU FOR

48:28.139 --> 48:30.942
CONTRIBUTING TO THAT, AND I LOVE
YOU VERY MUCH.

48:30.976 --> 48:32.210
THANK YOU.

48:32.243 --> 48:33.778
>> Julie: THANK YOU,
CHRISTMAS.

48:33.811 --> 48:36.147
THANK YOU BOTH.

48:36.181 --> 48:40.851
JOSH, YOU ARE NOW GUARANTEED AT
LEAST SECOND PLACE AND THE

48:40.885 --> 48:42.587
$50,000 PRIZE THAT GOES WITH IT.

48:42.620 --> 48:47.125
BUT YOU HAVE A BIG DECISION TO
MAKE BY DECIDING WHOM TO EVICT.

48:47.158 --> 48:51.496
YOU'RE ALSO DECIDING WHO WILL
STAY AND SIT NEXT TO YOU WHEN

48:51.529 --> 48:53.564
THE JURY VOTES FOR THE WINNER OF
"BIG BROTHER."

48:53.598 --> 48:58.036
THIS COULD BE A $500,000
DECISION FOR YOU, JOSH.

48:58.069 --> 49:00.005
ARE YOU READY TO MAKE IT?

49:00.038 --> 49:00.771
>> YES.

49:00.805 --> 49:02.507
>> Julie: ALL RIGHT, PLEASE
STAND.

49:02.540 --> 49:06.177
GO TO THE HEAD OF THE LIVING
ROOM, AND CAST YOUR VOTE TO

49:06.211 --> 49:11.149
EVICT.

49:11.182 --> 49:13.751
>> OH, THIS IS HARD.

49:13.784 --> 49:18.723
I LOVE YOU BOTH DEARLY, AND YOU
GUYS HAVE BEEN THE BEST AND

49:18.756 --> 49:22.193
CLOSEST FRIENDS TO ME IN THIS
HOUSE, AND TO BE HONEST WITH

49:22.227 --> 49:24.529
YOU, IF IT WASN'T FOR EACH OF
YOU, I WOULDN'T HAVE MADE HIT

49:24.562 --> 49:25.396
THE FAR.

49:25.430 --> 49:26.164
I LOVE YOU GUYS.

49:26.197 --> 49:28.133
I HAVE BEEN PLAYING.

49:28.166 --> 49:30.801
I'VE WORKED MY BUTT OFF AND I
PLAYED MY HEART OUT.

49:30.835 --> 49:34.205
AND I JUST THINK ABOUT JURY, AND
I THINK ABOUT HOW MANY PEOPLE

49:34.239 --> 49:38.709
ARE PISSED OFF AT ME IN JURY AND
HOW MANY PEOPLE I'VE UPSET IN

49:38.743 --> 49:43.581
JURY, AND I THINK I HAVE A
BETTER CHANCE, CALL ME CRAZY,

49:43.614 --> 49:44.882
SITTING NEXT TO PAUL IN THE END.

49:44.915 --> 49:47.218
I'M SO SORRY, CHRISTMAS, I LOVE
YOU SO MUCH.

49:47.252 --> 49:53.224
THANK YOU FOR BEING MY ROCK IN
THIS GAME, BUT YOU ARE A BAD ASS

49:53.258 --> 49:55.960
AND ONE OF THE STRONGEST,
TOUGHEST COMPETITORS, AND YOU

49:55.993 --> 49:58.663
KILLED EVERYBODY WITH KINDNESS
AND HANDLED EVERY SINGLE

49:58.696 --> 50:02.033
EVICTION WITH GRACE, AND I JUST
THINK THAT I WOULDN'T WIN

50:02.067 --> 50:03.201
AGAINST YOU.

50:03.234 --> 50:07.905
IT'S A GAME DECISION, AND I'M
JUST DOING IT FOR MY FAMILY.

50:07.938 --> 50:10.208
>> Julie: IT'S OFFICIAL.

50:10.241 --> 50:12.343
CHRISTMAS, YOU'RE THE LAST
PERSON TO BE EVICTED FROM THE

50:12.377 --> 50:19.684
"BIG BROTHER" HOUSE.

50:19.717 --> 50:21.619
>> LOVE YOU.

50:21.652 --> 50:23.854
THE MISFITS.

50:23.888 --> 50:24.955
>> THE MISFITS.

50:24.989 --> 50:26.557
>> LOVE YOU GUYS.

50:26.591 --> 50:35.300
>> LOVE YOU, TOO.

50:35.333 --> 50:37.168
>> Julie: CHRISTMAS.

50:37.202 --> 50:38.436
>> DON'T APOLOGIZE.

50:38.469 --> 50:40.671
>> Julie: CHRISTMAS, WE NEED
YOU TO LEAVE IMMEDIATELY,

50:40.705 --> 50:41.072
PLEASE.

50:41.106 --> 50:41.872
>> BYE, GUYS.

50:41.906 --> 50:47.312
>> BYE, CHRISTMAS.

50:47.345 --> 50:48.746
>> I LOVE YOU.

50:48.779 --> 50:51.516
>> I LOVE YOU.

50:51.549 --> 50:59.290
I LOVE YOU, JULIE.

50:59.324 --> 51:03.894
>> Julie: RUNNING.

51:03.928 --> 51:04.795
GOOD FOR YOU.

51:04.829 --> 51:05.663
WELCOME.

51:05.696 --> 51:12.403
WELCOME, WELCOME.

51:12.437 --> 51:13.771
>> WE DID IT, DUDE.

51:13.804 --> 51:21.179
WE WON.

51:21.212 --> 51:23.047
>> OH, MY GOD, DUDE.

51:23.080 --> 51:23.681
WE DID IT.

51:23.714 --> 51:25.850
>> MIC IS --.

51:25.883 --> 51:27.852
>> Julie: CHRISTMAS, YOU WERE
TIGHT WITH JOSH.

51:27.885 --> 51:28.753
HE DIDN'T CHOOSE YOU.

51:28.786 --> 51:29.354
HOW DOES IT FEEL?

51:29.387 --> 51:31.122
>> I'M PROUD OF HIM.

51:31.156 --> 51:32.390
>> Julie: WHY?

51:32.423 --> 51:35.593
BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY IN YOUR SPEECH
YOU WEREN'T ASKING HIM TO KEEP

51:35.626 --> 51:36.861
YOU.

51:36.894 --> 51:38.529
IT SEEMED LIKE YOU WERE RESIGNED
TO THE FACT THAT YOU WERE GOING

51:38.563 --> 51:41.065
TO BE SAYING GOOD-BYE TO THESE
TWO GUYS.

51:41.098 --> 51:42.333
WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU'RE PROUD OF
HIM?

51:42.367 --> 51:47.638
>> I'M PROUD OF HIM BECAUSE HE
ALWAYS ACTS WITH HIS HEART, AND

51:47.672 --> 51:52.977
HE FINALLY STARTED THINKING TRUE
STRATEGICALLY, AND HE'S RIGHT, I

51:53.010 --> 51:57.615
DON'T KNOW IF I WOULD HAVE WON
OVER HIM, BUT I DON'T KNOW, I'M

51:57.648 --> 51:58.849
JUST PROUD OF HIM.

51:58.883 --> 52:02.387
HE MADE THE ULTIMATE GAME MOVE,
AND...

52:02.420 --> 52:05.190
>> Julie: DON'T REVEAL TO US
WHO YOU'RE GOING TO VOTE FOR.

52:05.223 --> 52:06.491
>> NOPE, NOT GOING TO.

52:06.524 --> 52:10.127
>> Julie: THAT BEING SAID, DO
YOU THINK HE MADE THE RIGHT

52:10.161 --> 52:11.629
CHOICE FOR HIS GAME?

52:11.662 --> 52:14.565
DO YOU THINK HE HAS A BETTER
CHANCE OF PERHAPS WINNING

52:14.599 --> 52:18.536
AGAINST PAUL THAN HAD HE TAKEN
YOU?

52:18.569 --> 52:21.606
>> I THINK THAT HE HAS A BETTER
CHANCE, YEAH.

52:21.639 --> 52:23.374
>> Julie: WHY?

52:23.408 --> 52:27.612
>> YOU KNOW, MY MOM TOLD ME TO
KILL 'EM WITH KINDNESS BEFORE I

52:27.645 --> 52:32.550
CAME, AND I JUST TRIED TO ALWAYS
HOLD MYSELF WITH INTEGRITY, AND

52:32.583 --> 52:36.754
I KNOW THAT I LOST MY TOP A FEW
TIMES.

52:36.787 --> 52:39.357
CRAZY CHRISTMAS CAME OUT.

52:39.390 --> 52:40.558
BUT...

52:40.591 --> 52:42.393
>> Julie: YOU THINK YOU HAD A
BETTER SOCIAL GAME, YOU DIDN'T

52:42.427 --> 52:42.793
MAKE ENEMIES?

52:42.827 --> 52:45.162
>> I THINK SO.

52:45.196 --> 52:48.966
PAUL HAS A GREAT SOCIAL GAME BUT
HE'S A VET, HE'S RALLY, REALLY

52:48.999 --> 52:51.236
GOOD AT THIS GAME, AND I THINK
PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE TO SEE THAT.

52:51.269 --> 52:53.771
>> Julie: IN THE REAL WORLD,
YOU ARE A COMPETITOR.

52:53.804 --> 52:55.640
YOU'RE A CROSSFIT CHAMP.

52:55.673 --> 53:00.311
HAD YOU NOT BROKEN YOUR FOOT IN
THE GAME, WOULD YOU HAVE HAD A

53:00.345 --> 53:04.081
TOTALLY DIFFERENT STRATEGY IN
PLAYING THIS THAN HOW WE SAW?

53:04.114 --> 53:05.650
>> YES.

53:05.683 --> 53:06.317
YES, JULIE.

53:06.351 --> 53:08.419
YES.

53:08.453 --> 53:09.587
I LOVE COMPETING.

53:09.620 --> 53:10.821
I LOVE WINNING.

53:10.855 --> 53:14.892
I LOVE PUSHING MYSELF TO PASS
WHAT I THINK MY LIMITS ARE, AND,

53:14.925 --> 53:19.397
YOU KNOW, THAT'S ONE THING THAT
I WAS HOPING... WHEN I DID BREAK

53:19.430 --> 53:23.268
MY FOOT AND "BIG BROTHER" WAS
AMAZING ENOUGH TO LET ME STAY, I

53:23.301 --> 53:25.770
WAS HOPING FOR PEOPLE TO REALIZE
NO MATTER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES

53:25.803 --> 53:28.506
THEY'RE GIVEN, YOU CAN MAKE THE
BEST OF IT AND YOU CAN SURPRISE

53:28.539 --> 53:29.740
YOURSELF.

53:29.774 --> 53:32.610
THERE IS NO WAY I THOUGHT I WAS
GOING TO BE ABLE TO BE IN TOP

53:32.643 --> 53:33.878
THREE, AND HERE I AM.

53:33.911 --> 53:36.647
I HAVE TWO AMAZING FRIENDS, AND
I GET TO SHOW EVERYBODY THAT YOU

53:36.681 --> 53:38.916
CAN DO WHATEVER YOU PUT YOUR
MIND TO.

53:38.949 --> 53:40.385
>> Julie: YOU FEEL PROUD OF
YOURSELF?

53:40.418 --> 53:42.253
>> I AM PROUD OF MYSELF.

53:42.287 --> 53:44.822
>> Julie: GOOD FOR YOU.

53:44.855 --> 53:46.324
>> THANK YOU, JULIE.

53:46.357 --> 53:48.426
>> Julie: YOU'RE THE LAST
JUROR.

53:48.459 --> 53:53.163
WE'LL SEE YOU SHORTLY WHEN YOU
AND THE OTHERS THANK YOU VOTES.

53:53.197 --> 53:54.131
THANK YOU, CHRISTMAS.

53:54.164 --> 53:55.266
STAY SEATED.

53:55.300 --> 53:57.234
UP NEXT, THE FINAL TWO ARE
REVEALED TO THE JURY, AND THE

53:57.268 --> 53:59.704
JURY GETS THE CHANCE TO GRILL
THEM, LOOKING FOR ANSWERS TO

53:59.737 --> 54:04.041
HELP THEM MAKE THEIR DECISION ON
WHO DESERVES THE $500,000 GRAND

54:04.074 --> 54:06.877
PRIZE.

54:07.512 --> 54:09.380
THE LIVE INTERROGATION IS NEXT.

54:09.414 --> 54:11.416
STAY WITH US.

54:33.270 --> 54:36.240
>> Julie: WELCOME BACK TO THE
SEASON FINALE OF "BIG BROTHER."

54:36.273 --> 54:39.677
THE FATE IN THE FINAL TWO NOW
RESTS IN THE HANDS OF THE JURY.

54:39.710 --> 54:45.249
PLEASE WELCOME CODY.

54:45.282 --> 54:50.254
ALAINA.

54:50.287 --> 54:51.489
MARK.

54:51.522 --> 54:54.692
MATT.

54:54.725 --> 54:57.094
JASON.

54:57.127 --> 54:59.597
RAVEN.

54:59.630 --> 55:05.069
ALEX.

55:05.102 --> 55:09.674
AND KEVIN.

55:09.707 --> 55:19.417
HELLO, HELLO.

55:19.450 --> 55:20.485
WELCOME BACK, EVERYONE.

55:20.518 --> 55:22.753
RIGHT NOW THERE ARE ONLY EIGHT
OF YOU HERE RIGHT NOW.

55:22.787 --> 55:23.821
THAT'S BECAUSE?

55:23.854 --> 55:28.659
>> JUST MOMENTS AGO THE LAST
HOUSEGUEST WAS EVICTED.

55:28.693 --> 55:31.161
AND WILL BE COMING OUT SHORTLY.

55:31.195 --> 55:35.966
JASON, WHO DO YOU THINK IS JURY
NUMBER NINE?

55:36.000 --> 55:37.768
NOT WHO YOU HOPE, WHO DO YOU
THINK?

55:37.802 --> 55:39.970
>> I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE
CHRISTMAS.

55:40.004 --> 55:41.872
>> Julie: MARK, WHO DO YOU
THINK IT'S GOING TO BE?

55:41.906 --> 55:42.873
>> CHRISTMAS.

55:42.907 --> 55:46.210
>> Julie: LET'S SEE IF YOU
GUYS ARE RIGHT.

55:46.243 --> 55:49.079
JUROR NUMBER NINE, COME ON OUT.

55:49.113 --> 55:56.954
ALL RIGHT.

55:56.987 --> 55:58.122
YOU GUYS WERE RIGHT.

55:58.155 --> 56:01.659
NOW, JUST TO BRING EVERYONE TO
SPEED, JUST MOMENTS AGO JOSH

56:01.692 --> 56:06.296
BECAME THE FINAL H.O.H., AND
JOSH --

56:06.330 --> 56:07.598
>> WHAT?

56:07.632 --> 56:09.934
>> Julie: JOSH IS THE ONE WHO
EVICTED CHRISTMAS.

56:09.967 --> 56:11.135
ALL RIGHT.

56:11.168 --> 56:17.708
IN A FEW MOMENTS EVERYONE WILL
BE PASSING THEIR VOTE FOR WHO

56:17.742 --> 56:19.276
THEY THINK SHOULD WIN "BIG
BROTHER."

56:19.309 --> 56:21.746
BEFORE YOU DO THAT, YOU GET TO
QUESTION THE FINAL TWO AS A

56:21.779 --> 56:22.913
GROUP.

56:22.947 --> 56:26.484
WE HAVE ASKED YOU TO COME UP
WITH THREE QUESTIONS FOR EACH

56:26.517 --> 56:27.284
FINALIST.

56:27.317 --> 56:28.819
HAVE YOU ALL AGREED ON THE
QUESTIONS?

56:28.853 --> 56:29.887
>> YES.

56:29.920 --> 56:30.655
>> Julie: ALL RIGHT.

56:30.688 --> 56:34.158
THEN LET US GET STARTED, SHALL
WE?

56:34.191 --> 56:38.328
PAUL, JOSH, I'M HERE WITH THE
JURY, AND IN JUST A FEW MOMENT,

56:38.362 --> 56:41.198
THEY'LL BE VOTING FOR ONE OF YOU
TO WIN "BIG BROTHER," BUT BEFORE

56:41.231 --> 56:45.069
THEY DO, THEY'VE GOT SOME
QUESTIONS FOR THE TWO OF YOU.

56:45.102 --> 56:46.837
ALAINA, YOU'RE UP FIRST.

56:46.871 --> 56:49.874
>> ALL RIGHT.

56:49.907 --> 56:54.078
PAUL, SOME OF US IN THE JURY
FEEL THAT YOU ORCHESTRATED AND

56:54.111 --> 56:57.448
PARTICIPATED IN BULLYING TACTICS
IN THE HOUSE.

56:57.482 --> 57:01.852
WHY WAS THAT NECESSARY, AND HOW
DID IT SERVE YOUR GAME?

57:01.886 --> 57:05.189
>> I DEFINITELY DON'T THINK THAT
I WAS ORCHESTRATING BULLYING

57:05.222 --> 57:06.457
TACTICS.

57:06.491 --> 57:09.827
I DEFINITELY SPOKE UP ON BEHALF
OF A LOT OF PEOPLE, MAYBE PEOPLE

57:09.860 --> 57:12.730
WHAT THEY DIDN'T VOICE OUT
PUBLICLY, THEY WOULD TELL ME

57:12.763 --> 57:15.766
PRIVATELY, AND I FELT LIKE I WAS
THE ONE WHO HAD TO MEDIATE OR

57:15.800 --> 57:17.167
SPEAK ON EVERYBODY'S BEHALF.

57:17.201 --> 57:20.471
IT WASN'T SOMETHING THAT I EVER
SOLELY MADE ON MY DECISION, IT

57:20.505 --> 57:22.907
WAS SOMETHING THAT EVERYONE WAS
A PART OF.

57:22.940 --> 57:24.975
>> Julie: THANK YOU, PAUL.

57:25.009 --> 57:28.178
MATT?

57:28.212 --> 57:30.881
>> JOSH, THE JURY DOESN'T FEEL
YOU HAD A STRATEGY IN THE GAME.

57:30.915 --> 57:35.052
TELL US WHY WE'RE WRONG AND
EXPLAIN YOUR BIGGEST GAME MOVE?

57:35.085 --> 57:41.458
>> WELL, BIG SURPRISE TO YOU
GUYS AND I'VE BEEN A SUPERFAN

57:41.492 --> 57:42.827
SINCE I WAS 14 YEARS OLD.

57:42.860 --> 57:44.161
THIS IS MY BIGGEST DREAM.

57:44.194 --> 57:47.431
I'VE ENVISIONED MYSELF SINCE I
WAS 14 IN MY POSITION.

57:47.464 --> 57:51.836
MY BIGGEST MOVE HAD TO BE THE
STRATEGIC SOCIAL GAME I PLAYED.

57:51.869 --> 57:55.439
I ALIGNED WITH THE OUTSIDERS,
JASON AND ALEX, THE OUTSIDERS,

57:55.472 --> 58:00.044
AND I ALIGNED ALSO WITH
CHRISTMAS AND PAUL, WHICH WERE

58:00.077 --> 58:07.451
IN THAT 9-PERSON ALLIANCE WHICH
I KNEW WOULD BREAK UP.

58:07.484 --> 58:09.920
CHRISTMAS WAS GIVING ME PECKING
ORDER INFORMATION.

58:09.954 --> 58:12.657
I WAS KEEPING JASON AND ALEX
CALM.

58:12.690 --> 58:14.892
LUCKILY FOR CODY THAT HAPPENED
ON WEEK.

58:14.925 --> 58:17.795
TWO ALSO GETTING RID OF ALEX,
ONE OF THE STRONGEST COMPETITOR,

58:17.828 --> 58:20.297
IT WAS HARD BECAUSE SHE WAS ONE
OF MY CLOSEST FRIENDS IN THE

58:20.330 --> 58:21.532
GAME.

58:21.566 --> 58:24.669
SO IT WAS EXTREMELY HARD, BUT I
KNEW SHE KNEW THE GAME AS WELL

58:24.702 --> 58:27.404
AS I DID AND I HAD TO GET HER
OUT BECAUSE IF NOT SHE WOULD

58:27.437 --> 58:28.172
BEAT ME IN THE END.

58:28.205 --> 58:30.407
>> Julie: THANK YOU, JOSH.

58:30.440 --> 58:31.676
ALEX, YOU'RE NEXT.

58:31.709 --> 58:34.745
>> PAUL, IN YOUR LAST SEASON
YOUR GAME PLAY WAS BASED ON

58:34.779 --> 58:35.946
FRIENDSHIP.

58:35.980 --> 58:38.549
THIS SEASON WHY DID YOU DECIDE
TO GO AGAINST THAT BY CREATING

58:38.583 --> 58:41.686
FRIENDSHIPS AND ALLIANCES AND
THEN DETRYING THEM?

58:41.719 --> 58:44.655
>> I DON'T NECESSARILY THINK
THAT I DESTROYED ANY FRIENDSHIPS

58:44.689 --> 58:45.823
OR ALLIANCES.

58:45.856 --> 58:47.758
I TRIED TO GET FRIENDSHIP WITH
EVERYBODY IN THIS HOUSE, BUT

58:47.792 --> 58:50.194
UNFORTUNATELY A LOT OF PEOPLE
EITHER TURNED THEIR BACK ON ME

58:50.227 --> 58:53.664
OR I WOULD FIND OUT WERE HAVING
HYPOTHETICAL CONVERSATIONS ABOUT

58:53.698 --> 58:54.865
GETTING ME OUT.

58:54.899 --> 58:57.267
I TRIED TO HELP EVERYBODY AS
MUCH AS I COULD AND I GOT PEOPLE

58:57.301 --> 59:01.471
AS FAR AS I CAN BUT MAYBE THE
MISCONCEPTION IS I WOULD TOSS MY

59:01.505 --> 59:03.007
GAME FOR SOMEBODY ELSE'S.

59:03.040 --> 59:05.876
I DID HELP PEOPLE WHERE AND WHEN
I COULD, BUT I WOULD NEVER TOSS

59:05.910 --> 59:10.114
MY GAME OR STRETCH MY NECK OUT
IN ORDER FOR SOMEBODY ELSE TO

59:10.147 --> 59:11.348
JUST GO OVER ME.

59:11.381 --> 59:14.184
>> Julie: THANK YOU, PAUL.

59:14.218 --> 59:15.385
CODY, NEXT QUESTION.

59:15.419 --> 59:17.221
>> JOSH, SOME ON THE JURY FEEL
YOU POLICE DEPARTMENT A BIGGER

59:17.254 --> 59:19.156
PART IN PAUL'S GAME THAN YOUR
OWN.

59:19.189 --> 59:20.290
TELL US WHY WE'RE WRONG.

59:20.324 --> 59:22.292
>> I ACTUALLY PLAYED MY OWN
GAME.

59:22.326 --> 59:25.763
BEING IN THE BUSINESS INDUSTRY,
ONE OF THE BIGGEST TIPS THAT MY

59:25.796 --> 59:29.967
DAD GAVE ME WAS ALWAYS LET YOUR
BUSINESS PARTNERS AND PEOPLE

59:30.000 --> 59:32.269
YOU'RE DOING BUSINESS WITH FEEL
LIKE THEY HAVE THE CONTROL

59:32.302 --> 59:35.505
BECAUSE THEY'RE MORE... THEY
WANT TO INVEST MORE OR THEY FEEL

59:35.539 --> 59:36.674
SAFER WITH YOU.

59:36.707 --> 59:41.578
I DIDN'T WANT TO OPPOSE A
THREAT, MORE OF AN AL LIE, SO I

59:41.612 --> 59:43.380
DOWNPLAYED MY INTELLIGENCE AND
HOW SMART I WAS AND HOW MUCH I

59:43.413 --> 59:44.649
KNEW THE GAME.

59:44.682 --> 59:47.618
PAUL WAS A GREAT ALLY BECAUSE I
SAW HIM LAST SEASON, AND I KNEW

59:47.652 --> 59:50.287
NO MATTER WHAT HE WASN'T GOING
THE CHANGE HOW LOYAL HE WAS, SO

59:50.320 --> 59:51.722
I STUCK TO HIM AND IT WORKED.

59:51.756 --> 59:54.058
>> Julie: THANK YOU, JOSH.

59:54.091 --> 59:55.292
JASON, NEXT QUESTION.

59:55.325 --> 59:57.962
>> PAUL, IT SEEMS LIKE YOU MADE
MOVES THROUGHOUT THE GAME WITH

59:57.995 --> 1:00:02.232
THE GOAL OF AVOIDING MAKING
ENEMIES IN THE JURY.

1:00:02.266 --> 1:00:06.971
WHY UNNECESSARILY LIE TO OUR
FACES DAYS AND HOURS BEFORE WE

1:00:07.004 --> 1:00:08.706
WERE GOING TO THE JURY?

1:00:08.739 --> 1:00:12.242
YOU HAD TO HAVE KNOWN THAT WE
WOULD COMPARE NOTES.

1:00:12.276 --> 1:00:14.945
>> OF COURSE THERE WAS SOME
POINTS WHERE I KNEW THAT CERTAIN

1:00:14.979 --> 1:00:18.615
THINGS WERE GOING TO HAPPEN, BUT
AT THE SAME TIME, I DID DO AND

1:00:18.649 --> 1:00:20.517
SAY EVERYTHING THAT I WAS GOING
TO DO.

1:00:20.550 --> 1:00:23.020
IF I USED THE VETO, I SAID I
WOULD.

1:00:23.053 --> 1:00:25.122
IF I PULLED SOMEONE OFF, I DID.

1:00:25.155 --> 1:00:27.524
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, CERTAIN
PEOPLE, IF THE HOUSE WANTED A

1:00:27.557 --> 1:00:30.527
CERTAIN TARGET OUT AND I WAS
OUTNUMBERED, I COULDN'T

1:00:30.560 --> 1:00:31.796
NECESSARILY HELP THAT
INDIVIDUAL.

1:00:31.829 --> 1:00:34.564
I STILL HAD FRIENDSHIP WITH THAT
INDIVIDUAL, I WAS STILL CLOSE TO

1:00:34.598 --> 1:00:36.967
THAT INDIVIDUAL, BUT IF THE
ENTIRE HOUSE WAS AGAINST THEM,

1:00:37.001 --> 1:00:40.604
THEY WERE TOO AFRAID TO MAKE
CERTAIN DECISIONS ON THEIR OWN,

1:00:40.637 --> 1:00:41.906
I HAD THE PLAY MY PART.

1:00:41.939 --> 1:00:44.809
AND I WANTED TO KEEP MYSELF
AVAILABLE TO COMPETE THE

1:00:44.842 --> 1:00:48.378
FOLLOWING WEEK, SO IF I HAD
COMPETITIONS THROWN FOR CERTAIN

1:00:48.412 --> 1:00:51.949
PEOPLE TO WIN AND TAKE MY
TARGETS OUT FOR ME, I WAS

1:00:51.982 --> 1:00:55.019
ELIGIBLE TO COMPETE THE
FOLLOWING WEEK IN CASE AS A

1:00:55.052 --> 1:00:56.620
SECURITY BLANKET BECAUSE I NEVER
KNEW WHAT WOULD HAPPEN.

1:00:56.653 --> 1:00:57.822
>> Julie: MARK, NEXT QUESTION.

1:00:57.855 --> 1:01:00.958
>> JOSH, IT SEEMS LIKE EVERY
TIME YOU HAD AN ALTERCATION WITH

1:01:00.991 --> 1:01:04.461
SOMEONE IN THE HOUSE IT WOULD
RESULT IN YOU CRYING AFTERWARD,

1:01:04.494 --> 1:01:07.031
APOLOGIZING AND PROCLAIMING YOU
WOULDN'T DO IT ANYMORE, BUT IT

1:01:07.064 --> 1:01:10.634
WOULD INEVITABLY HAPPEN AGAIN.

1:01:10.667 --> 1:01:11.769
HOW DID THIS SERVE YOUR GAME?

1:01:11.802 --> 1:01:17.908
>> WELL, ACTUALLY, ONE OF MY
GAME MOVES WAS TO EXPOSE

1:01:17.942 --> 1:01:19.109
PEOPLE'S GAMES.

1:01:19.143 --> 1:01:22.179
I KNEW I WAS GOING TO STAY TRUE
TO MYSELF AND BE LOYAL, BUT

1:01:22.212 --> 1:01:25.816
HAVING AN EYE, BEING FAN, I CAN
EASILY SEE PEOPLE'S SHADY GAME

1:01:25.850 --> 1:01:27.017
PLAY.

1:01:27.051 --> 1:01:29.153
SO ONE OF MY STRATEGIES WAS TO
EXPOSE AND CALL OUT PEOPLE ON

1:01:29.186 --> 1:01:29.987
THEIR GAME.

1:01:30.020 --> 1:01:31.789
DID I FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT ALL THE
TIME?

1:01:31.822 --> 1:01:35.425
NO, BECAUSE I GENUINELY LIKED
ALL OF YOU, BUT IT WAS MY

1:01:35.459 --> 1:01:38.562
STRATEGY TO HAVE THE REST OF THE
HOUSE SEE WHAT A SHADY GAME SOME

1:01:38.595 --> 1:01:40.898
PEOPLE ALREADY PLAYING AND THE
MOVES THEY WERE MAKING.

1:01:40.931 --> 1:01:43.768
I FELT BAD BUT IT WAS PART OF MY
GAME AND IT GOT ME TO THIS

1:01:43.801 --> 1:01:44.368
POINT.

1:01:44.401 --> 1:01:44.802
>> Julie: ALL RIGHT.

1:01:44.835 --> 1:01:46.036
THANK YOU, JOSH.

1:01:46.070 --> 1:01:48.939
NOW, CHRISTMAS, YOU WERE JUST
EVICTED, SO I WANT TO GIVE YOU A

1:01:48.973 --> 1:01:53.110
CHANCE TO ASK ONE QUESTION, SO
GO AHEAD AND PICK EITHER PAUL OR

1:01:53.143 --> 1:01:56.981
JOSH, WHO YOU WANT TO ASK A
QUESTION TO, AND ASK AWAY.

1:01:57.014 --> 1:02:06.056
>> JOSH, MEATBALL, I WOULD LIKE
THE KNOW IF YOU WOULD RATHER

1:02:06.090 --> 1:02:08.725
EVICT PEPPY OR CRUTCHES AND WHY?

1:02:08.759 --> 1:02:14.899
>> WELL, I WOULD HAVE RATHER
EVICTED PEPPY, BECAUSE PEPPY

1:02:14.932 --> 1:02:18.202
WOULD STORM AROUND AND CHASE ME
DOWN WITH CREEPY CHRISTMAS HUGS

1:02:18.235 --> 1:02:21.638
AND DRIVE ME NUTS HALF THE TIME
I WAS HERE, BUT, YEAH, PEPPY FOR

1:02:21.671 --> 1:02:23.240
SURE.

1:02:23.273 --> 1:02:25.009
I LOVE YOU.

1:02:25.042 --> 1:02:27.377
>> Julie: ALL RIGHT, PAUL AND
JOSH, I WILL BE BACK IN JUST A

1:02:27.411 --> 1:02:31.248
FEW MOMENTS WHEN YOU'LL EACH
HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A

1:02:31.281 --> 1:02:34.084
FINAL STATEMENT TO THE JURY.

1:02:34.118 --> 1:02:37.621
WHEN WE RETURN, PAUL AND JOSH
HAVE ONE LAST CHANCE TO PLEAD

1:02:37.654 --> 1:02:41.859
THEIR CASE, A SPEECH THAT COULD
BE WORTH $500,000.

1:02:41.892 --> 1:02:48.365
STAY WITH US.

1:03:09.786 --> 1:03:11.755
>> Julie: WELCOME BACK TO THE
LIVE SEASON FINALE OF "BIG

1:03:11.788 --> 1:03:14.358
THE JURY IS JUST MOMENTS AWAY
FROM CASTING THEIR VOTES TO

1:03:14.391 --> 1:03:17.928
DETERMINE WHO WILL WIN "BIG
BROTHER," BUT BEFORE THEY DO,

1:03:17.962 --> 1:03:21.165
LET'S CHECK BACK IN WITH THE
FINAL TWO.

1:03:21.198 --> 1:03:24.835
PAUL, JOSH, IT'S NOW TIME FOR
THE JURY TO CAST THEIR VOTES,

1:03:24.869 --> 1:03:29.473
BUT FIRST, YOU EACH HAVE A
CHANCE TO TELL THEM WHY YOU

1:03:29.506 --> 1:03:32.542
DESERVE TO WIN "BIG BROTHER."

1:03:32.576 --> 1:03:35.779
PAUL, YOU'RE UP FIRST.

1:03:35.812 --> 1:03:38.815
>> Julie: HOUSEGUESTS, I KNOW
THAT AT SOME POINT EACH OF YOU

1:03:38.849 --> 1:03:41.852
WANTED TO, THOUGHT OF, OR TRIED
TO GET ME OUT OF THIS GAME.

1:03:41.886 --> 1:03:44.354
FROM THE SECOND I WALKED IN
THOSE DOORS, I WAS IMMEDIATELY

1:03:44.388 --> 1:03:45.055
PUT AT A DISADVANTAGE.

1:03:45.089 --> 1:03:46.356
I WAS THE ODD MAN OUT.

1:03:46.390 --> 1:03:49.059
YOU ALL KNEW WHO I WAS, SO I HAD
TO PLAY A DIFFERENT GAME THAN

1:03:49.093 --> 1:03:50.494
ALL OF YOU.

1:03:50.527 --> 1:03:54.098
WITH MY FIRST H.O.H. I USED MY
SOCIAL SKILLS TO GET CONTROL OF

1:03:54.131 --> 1:03:55.332
NUMBERS IN THE HOUSE.

1:03:55.365 --> 1:03:58.702
THEN I MADE IT A POINT TO ALWAYS
SET THE HOUSE TARGET IN PLACE.

1:03:58.735 --> 1:04:01.605
BECAUSE I HAD SUCH STRONG
CONTROL OF NUMBERS, NOBODY WILL

1:04:01.638 --> 1:04:05.375
TAKE A SHOT AT ME, AND EVERYONE
ASKED FOR MY ADVICE, SO I HAD A

1:04:05.409 --> 1:04:08.212
HAND IN EVERY H.O.H. AND I SET
UP A HOUSE TARGET IN FRONT OF

1:04:08.245 --> 1:04:09.413
ME.

1:04:09.446 --> 1:04:11.481
AFTER SURVIVING THE FIRST DOUBLE
EVICTION, I HAD TO CHANGE MY

1:04:11.515 --> 1:04:15.819
STRATEGY AND I POSITIONED MYSELF
IN A PERFECT PLACE BETWEEN THREE

1:04:15.852 --> 1:04:19.556
PAIRS, JOSHMAS, MAVEN AND JALIX.

1:04:19.589 --> 1:04:22.326
MY SOCIAL GAIL WAS SO STRONG, I
DIDN'T HAVE TO WIN ANYTHING.

1:04:22.359 --> 1:04:26.596
I LET THE RIGHT PEOPLE WIN AND
WHILE THEY WERE SHOOTING AT EACH

1:04:26.630 --> 1:04:29.233
OTHER, I MANEUVERED MY WAY TO
THE TOP.

1:04:29.266 --> 1:04:31.969
FROM THAT WAY ON I WON MYSELF
UNTIL THE END.

1:04:32.002 --> 1:04:33.837
I WON THE MOST IMPORTANT H.O.H.

1:04:33.870 --> 1:04:36.840
AND I WON'T THE MOST IMPORTANT
VETO WHO CONTROLLED WHO CAME THE

1:04:36.873 --> 1:04:39.009
FINAL THREE WITH WITH ME.

1:04:39.043 --> 1:04:42.012
I WON PART ONE OF THE H.O.H.,
SECURING MYSELF.

1:04:42.046 --> 1:04:44.514
AND I MADE SURE NO NEART WHAT I
WOULD END UP IN THIS POSITION

1:04:44.548 --> 1:04:44.881
RIGHT HERE.

1:04:44.915 --> 1:04:45.782
I DID.

1:04:45.815 --> 1:04:50.187
I HAD A TOTAL OF NINE
COMPETITIONS.

1:04:50.220 --> 1:04:53.690
EVERY TIME I WON H.O.H., I WON
THE VETO THAT CAME WITH IT.

1:04:53.723 --> 1:04:57.027
THE OTHER FOUR VETOES I WON NOT
ONLY KEPT ME SAFE IN THE GAME,

1:04:57.061 --> 1:04:59.964
BUT IT WAS PIVOTAL POWER MOVES
THAT PUSHED ME FORWARD.

1:04:59.997 --> 1:05:04.734
FROM THE SECOND I WALKED IN THIS
DOOR I WORKED MY ASS OFF MAKING

1:05:04.768 --> 1:05:07.104
TOUGH DECISIONS AND EVERYBODY
WANTED TO KNOW WHAT I WAS DOING

1:05:07.137 --> 1:05:09.806
AND WHAT I WAS THINKING, AND I
STILL MADE IT AND FOUGHT MY WAY

1:05:09.839 --> 1:05:12.309
TO THIS POINT RIGHT HERE WITHOUT
EVER TOUCHING THE BLOCK ONE

1:05:12.342 --> 1:05:14.278
SINGLE TIME THIS ENTIRE SEASON.

1:05:14.311 --> 1:05:15.179
THAT'S NOT BY LUCK.

1:05:15.212 --> 1:05:16.380
THAT'S NOT BY FRIENDSHIP.

1:05:16.413 --> 1:05:19.316
BUT THAT'S BY PLAYING THE HELL
OUT OF "BIG BROTHER," WHICH IS

1:05:19.349 --> 1:05:21.051
EXACTLY WHAT I CAME BACK HERE TO
DO.

1:05:21.085 --> 1:05:21.718
THANK YOU GUYS SO MUCH.

1:05:21.751 --> 1:05:23.320
>> Julie: THANK YOU, PAUL.

1:05:23.353 --> 1:05:24.921
JOSH?

1:05:24.955 --> 1:05:28.325
>> WELL, ALL THE GLORY TO GOD
FOR MAKING MY DREAM COME TRUE.

1:05:28.358 --> 1:05:31.461
I HAVE BEEN A FAN WHEN I WAS 14
YEARS OLD.

1:05:31.495 --> 1:05:32.696
I PLAYED FEARLESSLY.

1:05:32.729 --> 1:05:36.300
I HAD TO PUT TARGETS ON PEOPLE'S
BACK, EXPOSE PEOPLE'S GAMES SO

1:05:36.333 --> 1:05:38.502
THEY COULD SEE THE SHADY GAME
SOME PEOPLE WERE PLAYING.

1:05:38.535 --> 1:05:41.471
I ALIGNED MYSELF STRATEGICALLY
WITH CHRISTMAS AND PAUL BECAUSE

1:05:41.505 --> 1:05:46.176
THEY WERE IN A BIG ALLIANCE, AND
I ALIGNED WITH JASON AN ALEX.

1:05:46.210 --> 1:05:48.078
LUCKILY A REASON TO RIDE LINED
MYSELF WITH PEOPLE THAT WON MOST

1:05:48.112 --> 1:05:48.845
OF THE H.O.H.s.

1:05:48.878 --> 1:05:50.414
I TOOK SHOTS WHEN I WAS H.O.H.

1:05:50.447 --> 1:05:51.615
AND MADE MOVES.

1:05:51.648 --> 1:05:56.320
ALL THREE OF MY TARGETS, MARK,
ELENA AND JESSICA, WHICH ENDED

1:05:56.353 --> 1:06:01.258
UP WITH JESSICA GOING HOME, I
TOOK A SHOT AT ALEX, ONE OF THE

1:06:01.291 --> 1:06:03.560
STRONGEST GAME PLAYERS IN THE
HOUSE, SHE PLAYED A GREAT GAME.

1:06:03.593 --> 1:06:04.794
I ADAPTED TO THE GAME.

1:06:04.828 --> 1:06:09.033
I PLAYED FEARSLESSLY.

1:06:09.066 --> 1:06:11.001
SORRY, I'M NERVOUS.

1:06:11.035 --> 1:06:13.203
I... SHOOT.

1:06:13.237 --> 1:06:14.704
I'M SORRY.

1:06:14.738 --> 1:06:17.574
I ADAPTED TO THE GAME, PLAYED
FEARLESSLY, I PLAYED MY HEART

1:06:17.607 --> 1:06:19.676
OUT AND I GAVE IT EVERYTHING
THAT I'VE GOT.

1:06:19.709 --> 1:06:22.946
YOU KNOW, I HAD TO PLAY FROM DAY
ONE WHEN I DIDN'T GET A

1:06:22.979 --> 1:06:28.085
FRIENDSHIP BRACELET AND IF IT
WASN'T FOR, THAT I WOULDN'T MAKE

1:06:28.118 --> 1:06:30.754
IT TO DAY 92, I DIDN'T LET
PEOPLE KNOW HOW INTELLIGENT I

1:06:30.787 --> 1:06:32.022
WAS.

1:06:32.056 --> 1:06:34.858
I WAS UNDERESTIMATED, WHICH WAS
MY BIGGEST STRENGTH PHYSICALLY,

1:06:34.891 --> 1:06:37.494
MENTALLY AND HOW WELL I KNEW THE
GAME, AND NONE OF YOU CAUGHT ON

1:06:37.527 --> 1:06:38.695
TO THAT.

1:06:38.728 --> 1:06:40.564
YOU ALL UNDERESTIMATED ME AND
THAT'S WHY I'M SITTING HERE AT

1:06:40.597 --> 1:06:41.765
THE END.

1:06:41.798 --> 1:06:43.867
NOT ONLY DID I MAKE MOVES AND
TAKE SHOTS AND GET OUT STRONG

1:06:43.900 --> 1:06:46.570
PLAYERS, BUT I PLAYED LOYAL,
STICKING BY MY MORALS AND WHO I

1:06:46.603 --> 1:06:47.804
AM AS A PERSON.

1:06:47.837 --> 1:06:50.274
PEOPLE SAW THAT AND KEPT ME IN
THIS HOUSE AND I PLAYED THE HELL

1:06:50.307 --> 1:06:52.342
OUT OF THE GAME, SO I HOPE
THAT'S RESPECTED.

1:06:52.376 --> 1:06:53.910
>> Julie: THANK YOU, JOSH.

1:06:53.943 --> 1:06:55.145
THANK YOU BOTH.

1:06:55.179 --> 1:06:58.415
ALL RIGHT, JURORS, IT'S TIME FOR
EACH OF YOU TO STEP UP TO THE

1:06:58.448 --> 1:07:02.486
VOTING BOX AND VOTE FOR WHO YOU
THINK SHOULD WIN "BIG BROTHER."

1:07:02.519 --> 1:07:06.456
ONE AT A TIME, YOU WILL INSERT
THE KEY OF THE PERSON YOU WANT

1:08:31.641 --> 1:08:32.442

SEASON PLAY OUT FROM HOME.

1:09:35.839 --> 1:09:37.841
STAY WITH US.

1:10:05.201 --> 1:10:06.336
SEASON FINALE OF "BIG BROTHER."

1:10:06.370 --> 1:10:09.105
IT'S BEEN A WHILE SINCE THEY
LEFT THE "BIG BROTHER" HOUSE.

1:10:09.138 --> 1:10:13.243
PLEASE SAY HELLO TO CAMERON,
JILLIAN, DOMINIQUE, RAMSES, AND

1:10:13.277 --> 1:10:14.578
JESSICA.

1:10:14.611 --> 1:10:18.081
ALL RIGHT.

1:10:18.114 --> 1:10:19.215
WELCOME BACK.

1:10:19.249 --> 1:10:22.452
IT'S GOOD TO SEE EVERYONE BACK
IN THE SAME ROOM TOGETHER.

1:10:22.486 --> 1:10:26.556
WHEN EACH OF YOU GOT EVICTED,
YOU GOT TO GO HOME AND WATCH THE

1:10:26.590 --> 1:10:28.458
TRUTH, THE WHOLE STORY, WHAT
HAPPENED.

1:10:28.492 --> 1:10:32.161
I KNOW YOU WANT TO LET THE
JURORS IN ON WHAT WAS GOING ON

1:10:32.195 --> 1:10:33.397
THAT THEY'RE IN THE AWARE OF.

1:10:33.430 --> 1:10:36.366
JESS CASH I'M GOING TO START
WITH YOU.

1:10:36.400 --> 1:10:39.102
WE'RE GOING TO GET TO YOU AND
CODY IN A MOMENT, BECAUSE I

1:10:39.135 --> 1:10:42.038
E-MAIL SURE THE TWO OF YOU WANT
TO EMBRACE AND ALL THAT.

1:10:42.071 --> 1:10:44.908
YOU'LL HAVE YOUR MOMENT AT THE
END OF THE SHOW.

1:10:44.941 --> 1:10:46.910
BUT LET'S FIRST TALK GAME.

1:10:46.943 --> 1:10:49.313
WHAT DO YOU WANT THESE JURORS TO
KNOW?

1:10:49.346 --> 1:10:53.116
>> WELL, I TRIED WARNING YOU
GUYS AT THE END OF IT ALL, BUT

1:10:53.149 --> 1:10:54.183
YOU DIDN'T LISTEN.

1:10:54.217 --> 1:10:58.422
PAUL HAD AN ALLIANCE WITH
EVERYONE EXCEPT FOR CODY.

1:10:58.455 --> 1:11:00.123
HI, CODY.

1:11:00.156 --> 1:11:03.527
NOT ONE OF YOU MEANT MORE TO HIM
THAN THE OTHER PERSON.

1:11:03.560 --> 1:11:08.665
HE QUITE OFTEN LAUGHED AT YOU,
REFERRED TO HIMSELF AS THE

1:11:08.698 --> 1:11:12.168
PUPPET MASTER, AND HE PLAYED YOU
ALL, AND HE DID A GREAT JOB AT

1:11:12.201 --> 1:11:14.371
IT, BUT YOU GUYS LET HIM DO.

1:11:14.404 --> 1:11:18.408
AND THE WORST PART OF THE ENTIRE
SEASON WAS THAT MOST OF YOU HAVE

1:11:18.442 --> 1:11:24.914
BEEN QUOTED SEVERAL TIMES SAYING
THINGS LIKE, "PAUL DESERVES TO

1:11:24.948 --> 1:11:27.517
WIN," AND I "I HAVE NO PROBLEM
LOSING TO PAUL."

1:11:27.551 --> 1:11:29.953
AND FROM A "BIG BROTHER"
STANDPOINT, IF YOU GUYS WANTED

1:11:29.986 --> 1:11:32.589
TO PLAY LIKE, THAT YOU PROBABLY
SHOULDN'T HAVE COME IN THE

1:11:32.622 --> 1:11:33.823
HOUSE.

1:11:33.857 --> 1:11:39.596
>> Julie: YOU ALSO SAID MAYBE
NOT TO ONE ANOTHER, BUT YOU ALSO

1:11:39.629 --> 1:11:42.832
TALKED SO MUCH ABOUT, I TRUST
PAUL, I TRUST PAUL, I TRUST

1:11:42.866 --> 1:11:44.033
PAUL.

1:11:44.067 --> 1:11:45.935
YOU MAY NOT HAVE COMPARED NOTES
TO ONE ANOTHER WHILE IN THE

1:11:45.969 --> 1:11:50.574
HOUSE, BUT YOU CERTAINLY TOLD US
THAT WHILE IN THE DIARY ROOM.

1:11:50.607 --> 1:11:52.041
LET'S ALL TAKE A LOOK.

1:11:52.075 --> 1:11:55.111
>> OH, MY GOD, YES.

1:11:55.144 --> 1:12:02.652
>> SORRY I'M LATE.

1:12:02.686 --> 1:12:05.555
WHAT'S UP?

1:12:05.589 --> 1:12:08.525
HELLO, HOUSEGUESTS, THIS IS YOUR
PUPPET MASTER SPEAKING.

1:12:08.558 --> 1:12:12.562
>> PAUL FROM SEASON 18 JUST
WALKED INCH I CAN IN THE BELIEVE

1:12:12.596 --> 1:12:13.397
"BIG BROTHER" BROUGHT HIM BACK.

1:12:13.430 --> 1:12:14.998
>> REMIND ME YOUR NAME AGAIN.

1:12:15.031 --> 1:12:16.099
>> JESSICA.

1:12:16.132 --> 1:12:16.900
>> JESSICA.

1:12:16.933 --> 1:12:19.369
>> I AM SUCH FAN OF HIS.

1:12:19.403 --> 1:12:20.370
I NEED TO WORK WITH HIM.

1:12:20.404 --> 1:12:23.373
>> Julie: CONGRATULATIONS,
JESSICA.

1:12:23.407 --> 1:12:24.474
>> I KNOW PAUL.

1:12:24.508 --> 1:12:25.509
I TRUST PAUL.

1:12:25.542 --> 1:12:30.013
THE BEST THING HE DID WAS NOT
GIVE ME A BRACE LET?

1:12:30.046 --> 1:12:30.480
WHY.

1:12:30.514 --> 1:12:31.915
IT DISCONNECTS US.

1:12:31.948 --> 1:12:33.750
>> I'M TRUSTING WHAT PAUL SAYS.

1:12:33.783 --> 1:12:36.686
>> NOW THAT PAUL IS H.O.H., I
ACTUALLY FEEL SAFE.

1:12:36.720 --> 1:12:39.556
>> PAUL HAS A PLAN THIS WEEK,
AND I TRUST HIM.

1:12:39.589 --> 1:12:43.126
>> YOU KNOW WHAT, PAUL, I'M A
TEAM PLAYER, YOU WANT ME TO GO

1:12:43.159 --> 1:12:44.794
AHEAD AND COMPETE, I'M GOING TO
DO IT.

1:12:44.828 --> 1:12:48.465
>> I PROBABLY CONFIDED MORE IN
PAUL THAN I HAVE ANYONE ELSE

1:12:48.498 --> 1:12:48.998
GAME WISE.

1:12:49.032 --> 1:12:50.233
>> I FULLY TRUST PAUL.

1:12:50.266 --> 1:12:51.468
I TRUST HIM WITH MY GAME LIFE.

1:12:51.501 --> 1:12:55.972
>> I JUST HOPE PAUL WINS THIS
BECAUSE JASON AND I HAVE A GOOD

1:12:56.005 --> 1:12:57.206
RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM.

1:12:57.240 --> 1:12:59.843
>> IT PROBABLY DOESN'T GET ANY
BETTER THAN TO HAVE A TEAM LIKE

1:12:59.876 --> 1:13:01.044
PAUL AN ALEX.

1:13:01.077 --> 1:13:03.146
>> OTHER THAN CHRISTMAS, PAUL IS
THE ONLY OTHER PERSON THAT I

1:13:03.179 --> 1:13:04.280
TRUST IN THIS HOUSE.

1:13:04.313 --> 1:13:07.016
>> I THINK THAT PAUL'S AN
EXCEPTIONAL PERSON AND ONE OF

1:13:07.050 --> 1:13:09.252
THE MOST INTERESTING PEOPLE
THEY'VE EVER MET.

1:13:09.285 --> 1:13:11.821
>> PAUL IS MY FINAL-TWO GUY.

1:13:11.855 --> 1:13:13.156
WE'RE TWO SMART PEOPLE.

1:13:13.189 --> 1:13:14.691
WE KNOW HOW TO PLAY THIS GAME.

1:13:14.724 --> 1:13:16.526
PAUL IS MY BUDDY.

1:13:16.560 --> 1:13:17.894
>> PAUL PULLED THROUGH AGAIN.

1:13:17.927 --> 1:13:19.663
HE DID WHAT HE SAID HE WAS GOING
TO DO.

1:13:19.696 --> 1:13:20.864
>> I TRUST PAUL.

1:13:20.897 --> 1:13:22.832
HE'S ALWAYS GIVEN ME THE TRUTH
ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENED.

1:13:22.866 --> 1:13:24.033
HE'S GIVEN ME HIS WORD.

1:13:24.067 --> 1:13:24.834
>> PAUL.

1:13:24.868 --> 1:13:25.535
>> PAUL.

1:13:25.569 --> 1:13:26.135
>> PAUL.

1:13:26.169 --> 1:13:26.570
>> PAUL.

1:13:26.603 --> 1:13:28.404
>> PAUL.

1:13:28.438 --> 1:13:28.838
>> PAUL.

1:13:28.872 --> 1:13:30.039
>> PAUL.

1:13:30.073 --> 1:13:33.342
>> NOW THAT I'M STRUNG UP ALL MY
PUPPETS, MADE THEM NICE AND

1:13:33.376 --> 1:13:35.512
SHINY, I CAN PICK THEM UP AND
MAKE THEM DANCE.

1:13:35.545 --> 1:13:37.847
>> WHOA.

1:13:37.881 --> 1:13:42.786
>> Julie: JUST FOR THE
RECORD -- ALL RIGHT.

1:13:42.819 --> 1:13:46.089
DURING THAT TAPED PIECE,
EVERYONE WAS LAUGHING, EXCEPT

1:13:46.122 --> 1:13:48.658
CODY.

1:13:48.692 --> 1:13:50.193
I TRIED WARNING YOU GUYS.

1:13:50.226 --> 1:13:55.832
BEFORE I GET A REACTION FROM ANY
JURORS, JESSICA, YOU WERE ONE

1:13:55.865 --> 1:13:58.167
WEEK AWAY FROM MAKING IT TO THE
JURY, IF YOU WERE ON THE JURY,

1:13:58.201 --> 1:14:00.604
WHO WOULD YOU VOTE FOR TO WIN
BETWEEN PAUL AND JOSH IN

1:14:00.637 --> 1:14:05.509
>> WELL, WATCHING HOW PAUL... HE
HAD EVERYTHING TO DO WITH EVERY

1:14:05.542 --> 1:14:08.444
HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD, EVERY
EVICTION, HE ORCHESTRATED

1:14:08.478 --> 1:14:11.380
EVERYTHING FROM BEGINNING TO
END.

1:14:11.414 --> 1:14:13.750
COMPETITIONS WERE THROWN IN HIS
NAME, AND I THINK HE PLAYED A

1:14:13.783 --> 1:14:16.986
GREAT GAME, AND IF I WAS IN
JURY, HE WOULD GET MY VOTE

1:14:17.020 --> 1:14:17.554
TONIGHT.

1:14:17.587 --> 1:14:18.154
>> Julie: OKAY.

1:14:18.187 --> 1:14:19.589
LET ME TURN TO YOU, JASON.

1:14:19.623 --> 1:14:24.227
ARE YOU SURPRISED THAT EVERYBODY
TRUSTED PAUL JUST AS MUCH AS YOU

1:14:24.260 --> 1:14:25.595
TRUSTED PAUL?

1:14:25.629 --> 1:14:29.032
>> HE WAS GOOD AT HIS CRAFT.

1:14:29.065 --> 1:14:32.736
HE HAD MY HOOK, LINE AND SINKER.

1:14:32.769 --> 1:14:35.739
I WOULD BASICALLY HAVE... I
BASICALLY DID JUST ABOUT

1:14:35.772 --> 1:14:36.873
EVERYTHING HE SAID.

1:14:36.906 --> 1:14:41.678
I FORFEITED MY OWN OPINION HALF
THE TIME, SO I WAS SUPER

1:14:41.711 --> 1:14:42.245
SHOCKED.

1:14:42.278 --> 1:14:43.379
>> Julie: ALL RIGHT.

1:14:43.412 --> 1:14:49.252
LET ME TURN TO PAUL, BECAUSE
PAUL YOU HAD TO DO A LOT OF

1:14:49.285 --> 1:14:51.955
BACKSTABBING, BLIND SIDING TO
GET TO WHERE YOU ARE RIGHT NOW

1:14:51.988 --> 1:14:56.793
WHOM WAS IT THE HARDEST TO
BETRAY IN THE HOUSE?

1:14:56.826 --> 1:14:57.994
>> SAY ME.

1:14:58.027 --> 1:15:04.601
>> Julie: OBVIOUSLY THERE WERE
SO MANY BETWEEN RAVEN, JASON,

1:15:04.634 --> 1:15:06.102
ALEX, ALL OF YOU GUYS.

1:15:06.135 --> 1:15:07.637
IT'S NOT THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE
FRIENDSHIPS.

1:15:07.671 --> 1:15:11.407
I BOOTHED WITH YOU SO MUCH THAT
I WAS TORN BETWEEN MY FRIENDSHIP

1:15:11.440 --> 1:15:13.242
WITH YOU AND MY GAME PLAY.

1:15:13.276 --> 1:15:16.245
I KNEW I WAS A RETURNING VET AND
I COULDN'T BE THE RUSHING VET

1:15:16.279 --> 1:15:16.813
WHO DID NOTHING.

1:15:16.846 --> 1:15:18.014
I HAD TO PLAY THE GAME.

1:15:18.047 --> 1:15:20.850
IN ORDER TO SURVIVE IN THE GAME,
I HAD THE MAKE THESE MOVES.

1:15:20.884 --> 1:15:23.953
THIS IS WHERE I AM NOW BECAUSE
OF THE MOVES I MADE.

1:15:23.987 --> 1:15:27.891
UNFORTUNATELY I COULDN'T SATISFY
EVERYBODY AND I'M SORRY, BUT I

1:15:27.924 --> 1:15:33.496
TRIED TO GET AS MUCH FRIENDSHIP
AS I COULD.

1:15:33.529 --> 1:15:37.500
>> Julie: WELL, PAUL, YOU
SHOULD KNOW THAT YOU WEREN'T THE

1:15:37.533 --> 1:15:40.003
ONLY ONE THAT WAS SNEAKY IN THE
HOUSE.

1:15:40.036 --> 1:15:43.873
JOSH, I WANT TO TURN TO YOU,
BECAUSE DURING YOUR GOOD-BYE

1:15:43.907 --> 1:15:46.610
MESSAGES TO THE EVICTED
HOUSEGUESTS, YOU GAVE THEM AN

1:15:46.643 --> 1:15:47.711
EARFUL.

1:15:47.744 --> 1:15:50.914
LET'S SHOW PAUL AND EVERYONE
WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

1:15:50.947 --> 1:15:53.783
>> WHISTLE NUT, PAUL CAME UP
WITH AN ELABORATE PLAN IN ORDER

1:15:53.817 --> 1:15:58.588
TO GET YOU OUT, AND I'VE BEEN IN
A FINAL-THREE ALLIANCE WITH

1:15:58.622 --> 1:15:59.856
CHRISTMAS AND PAUL FOR A WHILE
NOW.

1:15:59.889 --> 1:16:03.860
I HOPE YOU CAN RESPECT THE GAME
MOVE, BUT FOR MY GAME, I HAD TO

1:16:03.893 --> 1:16:07.931
LET YOU IMOSM RAVEN, I GOT TO
LET YOU KNOW, I HAVE A

1:16:07.964 --> 1:16:10.366
THREE-PERSON ALLIANCE WITH PAUL
AND CHRISTMAS.

1:16:10.399 --> 1:16:13.569
HONESTLY, I EXPECTED MY ALLIANCE
TO KEEP YOU, BUT INSTEAD THEY

1:16:13.603 --> 1:16:15.438
VOTED TO KEEP KEVIN.

1:16:15.471 --> 1:16:16.740
I'M SO SORRY.

1:16:16.773 --> 1:16:18.942
ALEX, I'VE HAD AN ALLIANCE WITH
PAUL AND CHRISTMAS.

1:16:18.975 --> 1:16:22.278
I HAD TO STAND BY THEM AND MAKE
THIS MOVE, AND I'M SO SORRY FOR

1:16:22.311 --> 1:16:24.948
THE MOVE, BUT I HOPE YOU CAN
RESPECT IT.

1:16:24.981 --> 1:16:27.617
KEVIN, I'VE BEEN ALIGNED WITH
CHRISTMAS AND PAUL, AND OUR GOAL

1:16:27.651 --> 1:16:33.089
WAS TO GET A FINAL THREE, SO I'M
SO SORRY, BUT YOU WERE OUR LAST

1:16:33.122 --> 1:16:34.858
TARGET.

1:16:34.891 --> 1:16:35.792
>> Julie: JOSH?

1:16:35.825 --> 1:16:37.026
>> YEAH.

1:16:37.060 --> 1:16:39.262
>> Julie: EXPLAIN TO EVERYONE
WHAT YOUR INTENTION WAS WHEN YOU

1:16:39.295 --> 1:16:40.930
RECORDED THOSE MESSAGES?

1:16:40.964 --> 1:16:42.198
>> BLAMING IT ON ME!

1:16:42.231 --> 1:16:43.432
>> NEW YORK I DIDN'T.

1:16:43.466 --> 1:16:47.470
>> LISTEN, HONESTLY, I WANTED
THEM TO KNOW THAT IT WAS ALL FOR

1:16:47.503 --> 1:16:48.638
GAME.

1:16:48.672 --> 1:16:51.307
I GAVE CHRISTMAS AND PAUL MY
WORD AND MY LOYALTY FROM WEEK

1:16:51.340 --> 1:16:52.208
ONE, DAY ONE.

1:16:52.241 --> 1:16:54.510
AND I STOOD BY THEM.

1:16:54.543 --> 1:16:57.546
BUT I DID STUFF IN ORDER FOR ME
TO WIN, THEY DIDN'T KNOW MY GAME

1:16:57.580 --> 1:17:00.717
OR THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS
GOING ON, AND IT WAS MY WAY TO

1:17:00.750 --> 1:17:04.220
EXPLAIN TO THEM WHAT WAS GOING
ON, BECAUSE NOBODY HAD ANY IDEA.

1:17:04.253 --> 1:17:05.454
EVERYBODY WAS LOST.

1:17:05.488 --> 1:17:08.925
AND IT WAS THE ONLY... WITHOUT
RUINING MY GAME, IT WAS THE ONLY

1:17:08.958 --> 1:17:11.527
WAY I COULD LET THEM KNOW THE
PLAN AND I WAS GOING TO STICK

1:17:11.560 --> 1:17:12.428
WITH THEM TO THE END.

1:17:12.461 --> 1:17:14.831
>> Julie: YOU ARE SHAKING YOUR
HEAD, PAUL.

1:17:14.864 --> 1:17:16.866
WHAT'S YOUR RESPONSE TO WHAT YOU
JUST SAW?

1:17:16.900 --> 1:17:21.404
>> HONESTLY, I THINK IT'S A
LITTLE COWARDLY TO TOSS THE

1:17:21.437 --> 1:17:23.940
BLAME, BUT I THINK HE GAVE ME
CREDIT IN AND OF ITSELF, BECAUSE

1:17:23.973 --> 1:17:28.912
I DID HAVE TO TAKE HIM THIS FAR,
BECAUSE I WAS HOPING THAT I

1:17:28.945 --> 1:17:31.447
COULD BEAT HIM.

1:17:31.480 --> 1:17:31.948
SO...

1:17:31.981 --> 1:17:34.918
>> Julie: ALL RIGHT.

1:17:34.951 --> 1:17:36.686
CAMERON, YOU WERE THE FIRST ONE
EVICTED.

1:17:36.720 --> 1:17:39.022
YOU GOT TO SEE EVERYTHING FROM
HOME PRETTY MUCH.

1:17:39.055 --> 1:17:40.189
WHAT SURPRISED YOU THE MOST?

1:17:40.223 --> 1:17:41.691
>> THE AMOUNT OF SHOWMANCES.

1:17:41.725 --> 1:17:44.060
THERE WERE SO MANY SHOWMANCES
RIGHT AWAY.

1:17:44.093 --> 1:17:47.296
IT SEEMED LIKE EVERYBODY CLICKED
UP AND IT SEEMED LIKE NOBODY WAS

1:17:47.330 --> 1:17:49.565
REALLY PLAYING FOR THEMSELVES.

1:17:49.598 --> 1:17:52.235
IT JUST SEEMED LIKE PEOPLE WERE
PLAYING FOR EACH OTHER OR

1:17:52.268 --> 1:17:53.402
PLAYING FOR PAUL.

1:17:53.436 --> 1:17:56.239
SO IT JUST... THE LACK OF
MOTIVATION, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU

1:17:56.272 --> 1:18:00.376
GUYS ALL HAVE $500,000 IN YOUR
BANK ACCOUNTS, BUT LIKE YOU ALL

1:18:00.409 --> 1:18:03.246
WERE JUST PLAYING FOR EACH OTHER
AND NOT FOR YOURSELF, AND THAT

1:18:03.279 --> 1:18:07.416
WAS REALLY FRUSTRATING FOR ME
BECAUSE I CAME IN AND WAS DOING

1:18:07.450 --> 1:18:10.286
WHATEVER I COULD IMMEDIATELY THE
STAY IN THAT HOUSE.

1:18:10.319 --> 1:18:15.058
>> Julie: NOW USUALLY --

1:18:15.091 --> 1:18:17.193
>> NAKED.

1:18:17.226 --> 1:18:20.696
>> Julie: USUALLY WHEN YOU'RE
A DUO IN THE HOUSE, THAT PUTS A

1:18:20.730 --> 1:18:23.599
TARGET ON YOUR BACK, BUT NONE OF
YOU WERE AFRAID TO SHOW THAT YOU

1:18:23.632 --> 1:18:24.968
WERE PAIRED UP WITH SOMEONE.

1:18:25.001 --> 1:18:29.472
AS A MATTER OF FACT, ALEX, I
WANT TO ASK YOU, WHEN SEASON 16

1:18:29.505 --> 1:18:33.843
WINNER DEREK WENT INTO THE HOUSE
AND SPENT SOME TIME WITH ALL OF

1:18:33.877 --> 1:18:37.380
YOU, YOU SAID IN FRONT OF
EVERYONE, MY RIDE OR DIE IS

1:18:37.413 --> 1:18:38.347
JASON.

1:18:38.381 --> 1:18:40.183
WHY DID YOU REVEAL THAT IN FRONT
OF EVERYBODY?

1:18:40.216 --> 1:18:43.619
>> I THINK IT'S BEEN PRETTY
OBVIOUS SINCE DAY ONE THAT WE'RE

1:18:43.652 --> 1:18:44.754
RIDE OR DIE.

1:18:44.788 --> 1:18:46.489
HE'S MY BEST FRIEND IN THE
HOUSE, MY FAMILY.

1:18:46.522 --> 1:18:48.024
I'M NOT ASHAMED OF JASON.

1:18:48.057 --> 1:18:49.658
THAT'S BEST GUY IN THIS GAME.

1:18:49.692 --> 1:18:51.861
>> WHEW!

1:18:51.895 --> 1:18:52.996
>> SO FAR.

1:18:53.029 --> 1:18:55.999
>> Julie: CODY, YOU HAVE NOT
SEEN JESSICA IN FIVE WEEKS.

1:18:56.032 --> 1:18:56.900
YOU'VE BEEN IN JURY.

1:18:56.933 --> 1:18:57.867
>> YEAH.

1:18:57.901 --> 1:18:59.202
>> Julie: HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT HER RIGHT NOW?

1:18:59.235 --> 1:19:01.437
>> GOOD.

1:19:01.470 --> 1:19:02.806
>> Julie: STILL WANT TO BE A

1:19:02.839 --> 1:19:03.306
COUPLE WITH HER?

1:19:03.339 --> 1:19:05.041
>> YES.

1:19:05.074 --> 1:19:08.011
AND I'M WAITING FOR THIS TO ALL
BE OVER SO I CAN GO HUG HER.

1:19:08.044 --> 1:19:09.545
>> Julie: WELL HANG ON, HANG
ON.

1:19:09.578 --> 1:19:13.349
>> I'VE BEEN WARNED MULTIPLE
TIMES THAT I CAN'T RUN ACROSS

1:19:13.382 --> 1:19:14.550
AND GAB JESSICA.

1:19:14.583 --> 1:19:18.521
>> Julie: LET ME ASK THE LADY,
JESSICA, YOU'VE BEEN AWAY FOR

1:19:18.554 --> 1:19:19.288
FIVE WEEKS.

1:19:19.322 --> 1:19:20.790
YOU WENT BACK TO THE OUTSIDE
WORLD.

1:19:20.824 --> 1:19:22.191
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT SEEING
CODY?

1:19:22.225 --> 1:19:24.828
>> WELL, I THINK EVERYBODY ON
THE OUTSIDE WORLD KNOWS THAT

1:19:24.861 --> 1:19:27.630
I'VE BEEN HIS BIGGEST FAN, HIS
BIGGEST SUPPORTER.

1:19:27.663 --> 1:19:31.200
I'VE BEEN ROOTING YOU ON
LITERALLY ALL DAY EVERY DAY, AND

1:19:31.234 --> 1:19:32.268
IF...

1:19:32.301 --> 1:19:34.037
>> Julie: DO YOU STILL WANT TO
BE IN A RELATIONSHIP?

1:19:34.070 --> 1:19:35.571
>> Julie: EVEN MORE SO.

1:19:35.604 --> 1:19:40.009
>> THAT'S ALL WE WANTED TO KNOW.

TO BEING $500,000 RICHER, HOW

1:24:07.610 --> 1:24:08.777
>> I HAVE NO WORDS.

1:24:08.811 --> 1:24:12.781
I DID IT ALL FOR MY FAMILY,
EVERY SINGLE THING, I DID IT FOR

1:24:12.815 --> 1:24:13.982
YOU, MOM.

I HAVE NO IDEA HOW I CAME UP
SHORT.

1:24:44.012 --> 1:24:45.748
I DID EVERYTHING THAT I COULD.

1:24:45.781 --> 1:24:46.849
IT WAS REALLY TOUGH.

1:24:46.882 --> 1:24:48.451
I WAS IN A TOUGH SPOT.

I WAS THE ONLY VET IN THE GAME.
