[children playing in distance]

04:41.866 --> 04:44.744
There's some more flowers, kids.
Go pick 'em.

04:44.953 --> 04:46.955
Yeah!

04:51.209 --> 04:53.169
That's a pretty one!

04:53.920 --> 04:57.799
- I don't have one.
- Well, go look for one over there.

04:58.716 --> 05:01.552
Oh, that's beautiful.
Let me look at that.

05:01.970 --> 05:03.972
Let me look at that!

05:04.722 --> 05:07.350
Now you can take them
home to your parents.

05:07.684 --> 05:09.852
Don't they smell nice?

05:15.692 --> 05:17.235
Hi.

05:23.866 --> 05:27.287
Too much trouble to pick the mail
up off the floor, Geoffrey?

05:29.622 --> 05:31.624
Hello?

05:35.211 --> 05:37.171
Look at this flower.

05:42.969 --> 05:44.929
All right! Attaway!

05:49.142 --> 05:52.312
You know, I think I actually
found something rare.

05:53.438 --> 05:54.772
What?

05:54.981 --> 05:58.276
- This plant. I think it's a grex.
- A what?

05:58.443 --> 06:02.280
G-R-E-X. That's when two
different species cross-pollinate

06:02.447 --> 06:05.283
and produce a third
completely unique one.

06:05.491 --> 06:07.410
And listen to this:

06:07.618 --> 06:14.334
"Epilobic, from the Greek epi:
Upon, and lobos: A pod."

06:14.667 --> 06:18.504
"Many of the species are dangerous
weeds and should be avoided."

06:18.713 --> 06:19.922
Dangerous?

06:20.131 --> 06:22.091
In the garden.

06:22.550 --> 06:25.636
See? Look how quickly it roots.

06:25.803 --> 06:28.306
"Their characteristic rapid
and widespread growth pattern

06:28.514 --> 06:32.226
was even observed in many of
the large war-torn cities of Europe."

06:32.393 --> 06:36.356
"Indeed, some of these plants
may thrive on devastated ground."

06:36.564 --> 06:38.399
Why don't we go up to Vail
for the weekend?

06:38.608 --> 06:40.151
Fly up Friday, hm?

06:40.360 --> 06:42.195
Okay, maybe. Sure.

06:42.820 --> 06:45.615
Geoffrey! I'm trying to read!

06:45.823 --> 06:48.117
You're in a good mood.
[television begins blaring]

06:48.326 --> 06:51.245
Well, I got something to look
forward to tonight: Playoffs.

06:51.454 --> 06:52.955
Geoffrey.

06:53.164 --> 06:56.000
- What?
- I'm reading.

06:56.459 --> 06:59.545
OK! I'll put the earphones on.
There, see? Happy?

06:59.754 --> 07:02.298
Never mind.
I'll go downstairs.

How nice to see you.

07:40.420 --> 07:42.213
What is that supposed to be?

07:42.547 --> 07:45.007
It is cervelles en matelote.

07:45.216 --> 07:48.177
In English, what would I be eating
if I ate that?

07:48.386 --> 07:52.515
- Ah. Calves' brains in red wine.
- Red wine and what else?

07:52.682 --> 07:54.267
<i>Mais, c'est impossible.</i>

07:54.475 --> 07:57.478
It's impossible.
It's a secret, Mr Bennell.

and garlic.

08:13.411 --> 08:15.955
- That's all?
- Oui. Yes.

08:25.047 --> 08:27.383
- What is that?
- A caper.

08:28.551 --> 08:29.510
No.

08:29.677 --> 08:32.263
Do you presume to tell us
what is in this stock?

08:32.429 --> 08:35.057
- It's a rat turd.
- A what?

08:35.265 --> 08:37.268
A rat turd.

08:37.809 --> 08:40.104
- A caper!
- A rat turd.

08:41.063 --> 08:42.607
A caper!

08:43.441 --> 08:45.443
If it's a caper,

08:45.610 --> 08:47.612

08:53.743 --> 08:57.205
I'm gonna bring you up
for permit revocation, Henri.

08:57.371 --> 09:01.792

to be serving crap like that in here.

- I've got it. It was a biggie.

Okay, we'll get a declaration
of "unsanitary" on him.

- Okay.

justify my every move to you.

You think it's true that if you
think you're losing your mind,

17:43.313 --> 17:44.940
then you're not?

17:46.859 --> 17:48.819
Well, I hope so.

17:51.113 --> 17:53.198
I know this is gonna sound insane.

What?

17:56.535 --> 17:59.830
Geoffrey is not Geoffrey.

18:00.998 --> 18:03.333
- How do you know?
- I know.

18:04.501 --> 18:07.546
I mean, on the outside
Geoffrey is still Geoffrey,

18:07.713 --> 18:10.924
but on the inside I can tell
there is something different.

18:11.133 --> 18:12.926
Something is missing.

18:13.093 --> 18:16.221
- What?
- Emotion, feelings.

18:16.430 --> 18:18.682
He's just not the same person.

18:21.935 --> 18:25.022
Really, you know what I mean?
I know it sounds crazy.

18:25.189 --> 18:28.650
Yeah, I know what you mean, I think.
Have you eaten?

18:28.859 --> 18:31.028
- I'm not hungry.
- Have a piece of celery.

18:31.195 --> 18:33.030
- I'm not...
- Eat, eat, eat.

18:35.449 --> 18:38.077
We can eat outside.
It's a beautiful night.

18:40.370 --> 18:42.998
Take that meat there, will you?
Get the cleaver and chop it up.

18:43.165 --> 18:46.376
And hand me some of the ginger,
the stuff that's chopped up there.

18:56.261 --> 18:59.890
You wanna know something else?
This is really weird.

19:03.060 --> 19:06.480
I went to see his sister Nora
to talk to her about it.

19:07.940 --> 19:10.192
But I couldn't.
I stopped myself.

19:11.110 --> 19:12.569
She changed, too?

19:12.986 --> 19:15.114
- Do you think I'm crazy?
- No.

19:17.950 --> 19:20.536
Do you wanna go see
my friend David Kibner?

19:20.869 --> 19:23.038
- The psychiatrist?
- Not like that.

19:23.205 --> 19:25.833
I mean, if you talk to him he
would put things into perspective.

19:27.042 --> 19:29.753
- I'm not crazy.
- No, no, no. I'm serious.

19:29.962 --> 19:31.547
He would eliminate a lot of things.

19:31.755 --> 19:34.091
He would eliminate whether
Geoffrey was having an affair,

19:34.299 --> 19:35.217
whether he'd become gay,

19:35.425 --> 19:37.511
whether he had a social disease,

19:37.719 --> 19:39.930
whether he had become a Republican.

19:40.097 --> 19:42.391
All the alternatives, all the things
that could have happened to him

19:42.599 --> 19:44.351
to have made you feel he had changed.
Something that he was doing.

19:44.560 --> 19:47.604

You wanna go see him?

19:50.357 --> 19:52.151
You think I'm nuts.

19:52.776 --> 19:53.986
No, I don't think you're crazy.

19:54.194 --> 19:55.863
Can you still do
the thing with your eyes?

19:58.073 --> 20:00.993
If you're not crazy,
you can do that thing with your eyes.

20:10.460 --> 20:12.004
You're not crazy.

20:12.171 --> 20:14.173
This is delicious.

You're a great cook.

20:16.425 --> 20:18.635
What time is Geoffrey getting back?

20:20.053 --> 20:22.014
He said not to wait up for him.

20:23.515 --> 20:25.642
D'you want some more wine?

20:53.879 --> 20:56.048
- Morning!
- Hello.

One, two... Mrs. Teng,
this one's got a coffee stain on it.

Here.

That's not coffee.

That is coffee.
I put it there myself.

- That not my wife.

23:59.940 --> 24:01.900
Some secret.

24:05.445 --> 24:07.614
It's a conspiracy.
I know it.

24:08.156 --> 24:10.283
There can't be a conspiracy.

24:10.575 --> 24:13.537
Matthew, I'm telling you,
something's going on here.

24:13.745 --> 24:15.747
Something that scares me.

24:15.914 --> 24:18.417
I tried to see Geoffrey today,
to talk to him.

24:18.667 --> 24:21.128
He's always in his office
in the morning.

24:27.384 --> 24:29.177
Geoffrey?

25:02.544 --> 25:04.546
It really was weird.

25:04.713 --> 25:07.382
Geoffrey was meeting
all sorts of strange people.

25:07.549 --> 25:09.676
Things were being passed between them.

25:09.885 --> 25:11.094
And none of them
were people you knew?

25:11.303 --> 25:12.679
I didn't know any of them.

25:12.888 --> 25:15.432
Maybe they were
patients of Geoffrey's.

25:15.599 --> 25:18.477
Oh, no, no, Matthew.
I know they weren't.

25:18.643 --> 25:21.521
I followed him all day from
one end of town to the other,

25:21.730 --> 25:25.108
and everywhere he went he had
these meetings with strange people.

25:38.288 --> 25:40.790
I felt so stupid
sneaking around spying on him,

25:40.999 --> 25:43.752
but I can't talk to him.
What can I do?

25:47.255 --> 25:51.008
Okay, well, Kibner will
be able to explain something.

25:51.009 --> 25:53.136
I don't need a psychiatrist.

25:53.345 --> 25:55.680
Just forget that he's a psychiatrist.

25:55.847 --> 25:57.933
Just think of him as
a very intelligent man,

25:58.141 --> 25:58.975
which is what he is.

25:59.184 --> 26:01.311
It's a book party. He's a celebrity.

26:01.520 --> 26:03.939
He's very famous
and you will really like him

26:04.147 --> 26:06.942
if you just forget that
you think he's a psychiatrist.

26:07.108 --> 26:09.319
I don't know... I don't know.

26:09.486 --> 26:12.239
Matthew,
I've lived in this city all my life,

26:12.405 --> 26:15.951
but somehow today
I felt everything had changed.

26:16.117 --> 26:19.287
People were different.
Not just Geoffrey, but everybody.

26:19.496 --> 26:22.415
Yesterday it all seemed normal.

26:23.250 --> 26:26.002
Today everything seemed the same,
but it wasn't.

26:26.920 --> 26:28.922
It was a nightmare.

26:29.089 --> 26:31.091
It really became frightening.

26:33.134 --> 26:36.388
It was like the whole city
had changed overnight.

26:49.609 --> 26:53.989
Did I ever tell you the one
about the English Camel Corps? Did I?

26:54.823 --> 26:57.951
They're trapped in the desert,
in the Sahara desert.

26:59.411 --> 27:01.496
They've been surrounded
by Rommel for 40 days

27:01.705 --> 27:03.498
and they've run out of food.

27:03.707 --> 27:07.919
And the captain comes
and makes an announcement to the men.

27:08.086 --> 27:09.713
And he says,

27:09.879 --> 27:14.634
"Men, I have some good news for you
and some bad news for you."

27:14.926 --> 27:17.929
- And one of the men says...
- Wait. You have told me this one.

27:18.138 --> 27:20.932
Oh.
[both laugh]

27:21.766 --> 27:23.935
Can I tell it to you again?

27:24.894 --> 27:26.062
Look out!

27:26.229 --> 27:27.856
Oh, my God! Lock the door!

27:28.023 --> 27:30.025
- They're coming!
- Maybe we should help him.

27:30.191 --> 27:33.194
Help! Help! They're coming.
They're coming. Listen to me!

27:33.361 --> 27:35.947
- He's smashed out of his skull.
- He's terrified.

27:36.114 --> 27:39.326
You're next. Please! Please!
You're next. We're in danger!

27:39.534 --> 27:41.369
Please listen to me...
Something terrible!

27:41.578 --> 27:44.748
Please. You're next!
Here they are. They're already here!

27:44.914 --> 27:46.333
[distant shriek]
Help! You're next!

27:46.541 --> 27:50.378
- They're coming. They're coming...
- He must have done something.

27:50.587 --> 27:52.213
[car horn blows]
[loud thud, screeching tires]

27:52.422 --> 27:54.215
[Matthew gasps]

27:56.259 --> 27:58.720
[sirens grow closer]
The policeman'll help.

28:25.080 --> 28:27.082
Oh my God.

28:27.415 --> 28:30.168
That poor man.
What was he talking about?

28:30.377 --> 28:33.755
I'll phone a witness report in
when I get to the bookstore.

28:35.423 --> 28:37.008
Matthew, Matthew,
thank God you're finally here!

28:37.217 --> 28:38.259
These people are driving me nuts.

28:38.468 --> 28:40.512
- Are we gonna have dinner later?
- No, no, I can't.

28:40.679 --> 28:41.513
Do you know where
there's a telephone?

28:41.721 --> 28:42.722
There's a telephone
right around the corner.

28:42.889 --> 28:46.601
- Elizabeth Driscoll, Jack Bellicec.
- This is the Elizabeth?

28:46.768 --> 28:49.062
The book is awful.
Kibner's book is awful.

28:49.229 --> 28:51.815
His ideas are garbage.
Kibner's ideas are pure garbage.

28:51.981 --> 28:54.734
How can you say that
about a man like Kibner?

28:54.943 --> 28:56.486
I'm not saying it about
a man like Kibner.

28:56.695 --> 28:57.612
I'm saying it about Kibner.

28:57.821 --> 28:59.656
He dashes one of these
things off every six months.

28:59.864 --> 29:01.658
It takes me six months
to write one line sometimes.

29:01.866 --> 29:02.909
Why?

29:03.076 --> 29:04.869
'Cause I pick each
word individually, that's why.

29:05.036 --> 29:08.623
- What's so hot about that?
- I wasn't even talking to you, was I?

29:08.790 --> 29:11.084
On the corner of Leavenworth and...

29:11.292 --> 29:13.211
- Turk.
- Turk? Turk.

29:13.712 --> 29:15.714
Is that him?

29:17.257 --> 29:18.633
Yes.

29:19.092 --> 29:20.093
Yes!

29:20.969 --> 29:22.721
- Yes.
- "What's so hot about that?

29:22.929 --> 29:25.014
What's so hot about that?"
I don't know...

29:25.223 --> 29:28.935
You must have a report on it 'cause
there was a motorcycle officer there

29:29.144 --> 29:31.438
- and an ambulance on the way.
- They follow me.

29:31.646 --> 29:32.731
They don't understand
what I'm saying.

29:32.939 --> 29:33.732
Ignore them.

29:33.940 --> 29:35.150
You don't have to
prove yourself to anybody.

29:35.316 --> 29:37.819
- That's easy for you to say.
- Of course I saw it.

29:37.986 --> 29:41.656
- The man was running down the street.
- It's romantic, sentimental,

29:41.865 --> 29:44.784
- He landed on my car.
- post-industrial nonsense.

29:44.951 --> 29:47.370
Just a second.
I am talking to the police.

29:47.579 --> 29:51.039
- No, he was bleeding on the road.
- What seems to be the trouble, officer?

29:51.040 --> 29:52.167
Hello? Yeah.

29:52.375 --> 29:54.502
Don't ever give your name to cops.

29:54.669 --> 29:57.088
Leavenworth and Turk. I'll hold.

29:57.297 --> 29:59.424
[Woman]: But it isn't!
He isn't my husband!

29:59.591 --> 30:02.135
It's someone who looks like him.
He's an impostor!

30:02.343 --> 30:06.055
Now, Katherine, he's your husband.
You know him and I know him.

30:06.264 --> 30:10.935
I had to wait until today 'cause he
has a scar on the back of his neck

30:11.144 --> 30:13.605
and when his hair is long
you can't see it.

30:13.813 --> 30:17.192
- He went to have a haircut today...
- And the scar was gone.

30:18.109 --> 30:20.236
No! It's still there!

30:20.403 --> 30:24.031
Of course it's still there.
What did you expect? He's still Ted.

30:24.032 --> 30:28.203
- Excuse me, can I say one thing?
- Please! He's still your husband Ted.

30:28.369 --> 30:30.330
- I know something...
- Katherine?

30:30.538 --> 30:32.290
- Could I say one thing?
- Katherine!

30:32.499 --> 30:33.957
Just a minute.

30:33.958 --> 30:36.211
- Katherine.
- Just give me a minute, will you?

30:36.419 --> 30:38.546
Will you trust me?

30:38.713 --> 30:41.965
Will you please trust me? Will you?

30:41.966 --> 30:45.178
Officer, I work for the county.
This is a public-spirited gesture.

30:45.386 --> 30:47.305
I will give you my name
if you will give me yours.

30:47.472 --> 30:48.848
Kibner's trying to change
people to fit the world.

30:49.015 --> 30:51.726
I'm trying to change
the world to fit people.

30:51.935 --> 30:55.146
- We'll talk about this in a second.
- Where's Homer? Where's Kazantzakis?

30:55.355 --> 30:57.941
- Where's Jack London?
- Where's Elizabeth?

30:58.149 --> 31:00.902
- I'm afraid!
- I understand, I know,

31:01.110 --> 31:03.613
and I understand.
Let me have your hand.

31:03.863 --> 31:06.449
- Katherine, just trust me.
- Isn't he wonderful?

31:06.658 --> 31:08.451
Come on.

31:08.660 --> 31:12.413
There. That's not so bad, is it?
Who's this behind me?

31:12.622 --> 31:15.082
- It's Ted.
- That's right.

31:15.083 --> 31:16.960
Hold on. Come on, just hold on.

31:17.126 --> 31:20.964
Hold on. Just relax now.

31:21.172 --> 31:24.008
- You gonna be all right? Feel better?
- Yeah. Yes.

31:24.217 --> 31:26.094
- You wanna go home now?
- Yes.

31:26.302 --> 31:29.222
- Will you come and see me tomorrow?
- Please... tomorrow.

31:29.389 --> 31:32.016
Tomorrow we'll all talk.
Okay? The three of us?

31:32.183 --> 31:34.185
[Ted]: Okay,
but I better take her home.

31:34.352 --> 31:36.354
[Kibner]: Yes. It's okay.

31:36.521 --> 31:38.523
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay.

31:39.023 --> 31:41.025
- All right?
- Okay.

31:46.614 --> 31:48.116
Alright, thank you.

31:48.324 --> 31:49.367
I never heard anything
like it in my life.

31:49.576 --> 31:50.618
They don't wanna hear
about the accident.

31:50.827 --> 31:52.579
[Jack]: Right, of course.
t's a big conspiracy.

31:52.787 --> 31:54.956
- What's a conspiracy?
- Everything.

31:56.416 --> 31:58.334
Excuse me.

32:02.755 --> 32:05.133
I understand
what you're trying to say.

32:05.341 --> 32:09.053
My name is Elizabeth Driscoll,
the Public Health Department. Call me.

32:09.262 --> 32:11.264
Katherine! Come on, Katherine.

32:13.641 --> 32:15.977
That woman's husband
is not her husband.

32:16.185 --> 32:18.688
I saw him today with Geoffrey.
He's one of them.

32:18.897 --> 32:20.982
And she knows about it
and nobody's helping her.

32:21.149 --> 32:22.859
That's not true.
Somebody's helping her.

32:23.026 --> 32:25.194
I'm glad you heard that.
David, come here. Elizabeth.

32:25.361 --> 32:27.488
I've been hearing it all week.
It's getting very popular.

32:27.697 --> 32:30.073
- What's getting popular?
- I was trying to tell you

32:30.074 --> 32:32.911
- that I also know somebody...
- Know somebody who's changed.

32:33.119 --> 32:35.788
- Yes.
- Can we go outside and talk about it?

32:37.457 --> 32:39.959
Listen, there's a lady up top,
red hair, blue dress.

32:40.168 --> 32:42.712
She's interested in your work.

32:47.717 --> 32:51.429
I've heard the same damn story
this week from six patients.

32:51.596 --> 32:54.098
People are changing,
they're becoming less human.

32:54.307 --> 32:56.309
It's happening all around us.

32:56.476 --> 32:58.686
That's not what we're talking about.

32:58.895 --> 33:01.356
This has nothing to do with
the man that I live with.

33:01.522 --> 33:04.108
It has everything to do with it.
Don't you see?

33:04.317 --> 33:06.861
People are stepping in and out
of relationships too fast

33:07.028 --> 33:09.405
because they don't
want the responsibility.

33:09.614 --> 33:11.658
That's why marriages
are going to hell.

33:11.866 --> 33:13.451
The whole family unit is shot to hell.

33:13.660 --> 33:15.161
David, you're not listening
to what she's saying.

33:15.370 --> 33:16.579
Matthew, please stay out of this.

33:16.788 --> 33:18.748
You see, that's the point.

33:18.915 --> 33:21.376
I'm listening to you,
but he doesn't think I am. Why?

33:21.584 --> 33:25.213
Because he doesn't expect me
to bother enough, or to care.

33:25.421 --> 33:28.174
Bellicec, I'm telling you for
the last time I want you to stop!

33:28.383 --> 33:31.052
- Stand still, be quiet, and shut up!
- Jack!

33:31.260 --> 33:32.595
How did you feel
about what I just did?

33:32.762 --> 33:34.305
Why in the store? He's a nut.

33:34.472 --> 33:35.640
How did you feel?

33:36.474 --> 33:38.476
You were probably shocked.

33:38.643 --> 33:41.062
You wanted to shut your feelings off,
withdraw,

33:41.270 --> 33:42.897
maybe make believe
it wasn't happening

33:43.064 --> 33:44.941
because then you don't
have to deal with it.

33:47.986 --> 33:50.613
I want to deal with that poor woman
in the bookstore.

33:50.822 --> 33:52.824
Why?

33:53.366 --> 33:55.368
Do you identify with her?

33:57.161 --> 33:58.788
Yes.

33:59.205 --> 34:00.623
Okay.

34:01.040 --> 34:02.583
Come on.

34:02.750 --> 34:05.628
Suppose I were to tell you
that Katherine is trying

34:05.795 --> 34:07.422
to escape from a relationship.

34:07.588 --> 34:08.130
He's treating her-

34:08.339 --> 34:10.425
What's this treatment have to do
with pushing me against a wall?

34:10.591 --> 34:12.385
- She's upset.
- She looks fine to me.

34:12.552 --> 34:15.221
- She is upset, Jack.
- Well, you look upset to me now.

34:15.388 --> 34:17.389
- Do me a favour, will ya?
- I'll do any favor you want.

34:17.598 --> 34:19.308
- Go home and I'll call you later.
- Go home?

34:19.516 --> 34:21.518
Just go home and
leave us alone for a little bit.

34:21.728 --> 34:23.730
- Okay?
- Okay. Okay.

34:23.938 --> 34:25.690
Thank you.

34:29.527 --> 34:31.987
You're jumping
to a very bizarre conclusion:

34:31.987 --> 34:35.366
That this man you live with
has been replaced by somebody else.

34:35.574 --> 34:38.578
Isn't it more likely that you
want to believe that he's changed

34:38.786 --> 34:41.414
because you're really looking
for an excuse to get out?

34:53.384 --> 34:54.967
I don't know.

34:54.969 --> 34:57.013
Will you think about it, please,

34:57.221 --> 34:59.223
before you make a move?

34:59.390 --> 35:03.019
Before you jump and
destroy something you have. Will you?

35:04.187 --> 35:06.189
Please?

35:10.818 --> 35:12.779
Yeah.

35:19.410 --> 35:20.953
Thank you.

35:21.120 --> 35:24.248
I just gave her
a psychological Band-Aid, Matthew.

35:24.457 --> 35:26.334
I should talk to her some more.

35:26.542 --> 35:29.545
You could bring her by my office
tomorrow around four.

35:29.712 --> 35:31.589
What's the matter with her?

35:31.756 --> 35:35.468
It's like there's some kind of
hallucinatory flu going around.

35:35.635 --> 35:37.595
People seem to
get over it in a day or two.

35:37.804 --> 35:39.347
All I can do is treat the symptoms.

35:39.514 --> 35:41.474
She's gonna be okay?

35:41.641 --> 35:43.893
A good night's sleep wouldn't hurt.

35:44.060 --> 35:46.312
- Is it contagious?
- Oh, Matthew!

35:47.438 --> 35:51.234
- Take her home to her boyfriend.
- That wasn't what I was thinking.

35:51.400 --> 35:54.779
I was just wondering whether the
Health Department should look at it.

35:54.987 --> 35:56.948
Who knows? I don't know.

35:57.698 --> 35:59.659
I wish I did.

36:00.701 --> 36:02.120
Okay.

36:03.621 --> 36:05.623
Take her home, Matthew.

36:22.431 --> 36:25.643
[soft classical music]

36:28.646 --> 36:31.649
Ah, Jack.
How was the book party?

36:33.693 --> 36:35.653
Is that Kibner's new book?

36:39.365 --> 36:41.367
Didn't get to read your poetry?

36:42.785 --> 36:44.787
I'm sorry, Jack.

36:45.121 --> 36:47.123
Good evening. Bellicec Baths.

36:49.000 --> 36:53.337
Yes, we recommend the 15-minute soak
in Calistoga volcanic ash,

36:53.546 --> 36:56.799
that's followed by
an Aqua-Surge whirlpool dip.

36:56.966 --> 37:00.553
[loud classical music]

37:13.608 --> 37:15.610
Hey, can you help me outta here?

37:18.112 --> 37:19.655
Bellicec!

37:19.864 --> 37:22.032
I'm talking to you. Give me a hand.

37:22.033 --> 37:24.035
Help me outta this thing.

37:25.995 --> 37:27.955
Stan...

37:28.122 --> 37:30.082
Every week we go through this.

37:30.249 --> 37:34.128
- Why can't you be more cooperative?
- Get me a towel.

37:34.337 --> 37:37.047
You are really gonna get hurt
one of these days.

37:37.048 --> 37:39.133
Give me another towel, would you?

37:39.342 --> 37:41.093
Come on.

37:53.564 --> 37:56.192
Nancy, shut the music off.

37:56.359 --> 37:58.402
It's for the plants, Stan.

37:58.569 --> 38:01.739
Screw the plants.
I hate the music.

38:01.948 --> 38:04.951
It's wonderful for my plants.
They just love it.

38:06.202 --> 38:09.121
Plants have feelings, you know,
just like people.

38:09.288 --> 38:13.626
It's fascinating. This type of music
stimulates the growth of the plants.

38:13.793 --> 38:15.920
They've done tons
of experiments on it.

38:16.087 --> 38:19.047
- Come on, Nancy. Turn the music off.
- Relax.

38:19.048 --> 38:21.634
You're not gonna
enjoy this if you don't.

38:52.456 --> 38:55.376
Oh! Mr Gianni, what are you doing here?

38:55.584 --> 38:58.003
This is must reading, Mrs Bellicec.

38:58.004 --> 39:00.256
Worlds In Collision by Velikovsky.

39:00.464 --> 39:03.843
Oh, yes. I've read that many times.
Have you read Star Maker

39:04.010 --> 39:07.847
by Olaf Stapledon?
That's must reading, too.

39:08.973 --> 39:13.102
- Well, it's awfully late, Mr. Gianni.
- You're so smart.

39:13.311 --> 39:14.395
Oh, Mr Gianni,

39:14.603 --> 39:16.397
you've been sitting
in that mud too long.

39:16.605 --> 39:18.941
It is possible to overdo it, you know.

39:19.775 --> 39:23.529
Oh, by the way, thank you for
that plant you gave me last time.

39:24.947 --> 39:27.616
[eerie hissing and rustling]

39:39.045 --> 39:41.839
[distant car alarm]

39:54.643 --> 39:56.645
I'll walk you inside.

39:57.855 --> 39:59.815
You don't have to.

40:07.656 --> 40:09.617
Geoffrey?

40:13.162 --> 40:15.164
That was sweet of him.

40:27.676 --> 40:29.470
Geoffrey?

40:33.766 --> 40:35.768
You all right?

40:36.727 --> 40:38.729
I'll see you tomorrow morning.

40:44.485 --> 40:47.988
Thank you, Matthew.
You've really made me feel better.

40:48.155 --> 40:50.533
And I'm gonna think about
what your friend Kibner said.

40:50.741 --> 40:51.659
Okay.

40:51.867 --> 40:53.744
Thanks for helping.
Good night.

40:53.911 --> 40:55.913
See you.

41:02.336 --> 41:04.296
Jack?

41:04.797 --> 41:06.799
Honey, where are ya?

41:08.008 --> 41:10.010
I don't wanna disturb you
if you're thinking,

41:10.219 --> 41:13.222
but I could sure do
with some Chinese food.

41:13.431 --> 41:15.474
I haven't eaten all day. Oh...

41:18.018 --> 41:20.187
Oh, Jack, you're gonna suffocate.

41:21.897 --> 41:23.691
[screams]

41:25.609 --> 41:27.653
- My nose--
- Jack!

41:29.280 --> 41:31.282
Let me out! Let me out!

41:31.490 --> 41:33.784
My nose is bleeding.

41:56.098 --> 41:57.183
[knock at door]

41:57.391 --> 41:58.851
Who is it?

41:59.894 --> 42:01.854
Who is it?

42:02.021 --> 42:04.482
[distant sirens]

42:05.065 --> 42:07.067
It's Matthew.

42:07.234 --> 42:09.612
- Come on in.
- What happened?

42:09.820 --> 42:11.363
Back here.

42:11.572 --> 42:13.199
Matthew, I called
you here as a friend.

42:13.407 --> 42:14.158
Oh, Jack...

42:14.366 --> 42:16.535
Do you report certain things
when you run into them

42:16.702 --> 42:19.121
like a contagious disease or a
dead body in a place of business?

42:19.288 --> 42:21.332
- Jack would you let him look at it?
- You found a body?

42:21.540 --> 42:24.126
- No, not necessarily...
- I thought it was Jack.

42:25.294 --> 42:26.961
Is that him?

42:26.962 --> 42:28.964
Yeah, under there.

42:31.717 --> 42:34.220
- What kind of joke is this?
- It's no joke.

42:34.929 --> 42:36.931
What is it?

42:45.981 --> 42:48.776
- What the hell is it?!
- Just keep calm, Nancy.

42:50.319 --> 42:52.321
Is it contagious?

42:52.488 --> 42:54.989
- Did any of your customers see this?
- No.

42:54.990 --> 42:56.325
It'd ruin us.
It's all we'd need.

42:56.534 --> 42:58.577
- Look, I'm calling the police.
- No, don't do that.

42:58.786 --> 43:00.538
- Why?
- Nancy, don't.

43:01.497 --> 43:03.499
Because I think Jack is right.

43:03.958 --> 43:06.043
It's not immature exactly.

43:06.252 --> 43:07.920
He's got an adult face.

43:08.128 --> 43:10.714
It's a monster.
It's got hair all over it.

43:10.923 --> 43:12.174
It's vague.

43:12.383 --> 43:14.385
Nose, lips, hair.

43:14.552 --> 43:17.388
Hands, everything,
but it's got no detail, no character.

43:17.596 --> 43:18.639
It's unformed.

43:18.847 --> 43:22.101
Jack, don't touch it.
You don't know where it's been.

43:23.143 --> 43:25.145
No respiration.

43:25.312 --> 43:27.398
It's got no fingerprints.

43:27.898 --> 43:29.858
No fingerprints?

43:31.819 --> 43:33.779
Like a fetus.

43:33.988 --> 43:35.948
You just said it was an adult.

43:36.115 --> 43:38.826
I said it was an adult
because it was tall.

43:38.993 --> 43:42.705
- How tall are you, Jack?
- Six foot four.

43:42.871 --> 43:45.958
- How much do you weigh?
- 170.

43:46.125 --> 43:48.502
- Why?
- Oh, no.

43:50.087 --> 43:51.589
No, Matthew.

43:52.840 --> 43:54.633
Oh, Jack!

43:54.800 --> 43:57.386
- Who are you calling?
- Elizabeth.

43:57.553 --> 43:59.555
Why?

43:59.763 --> 44:01.932
Why are you calling Elizabeth?

44:02.099 --> 44:04.977
- Matthew...
- Why?

44:06.979 --> 44:08.814
[phone rings]

44:15.946 --> 44:17.031
<i>[Matthew]: Hello?</i>

44:17.197 --> 44:21.076
<i>Elizabeth? Can you hear me?
It's Matthew, Elizabeth. Hello?</i>

44:21.785 --> 44:22.953
<i>Elizabeth, what's the matter?</i>

44:23.120 --> 44:25.497
<i>Elizabeth, can you hear me?</i>

44:25.706 --> 44:27.416
<i>Who is this?</i>

44:28.876 --> 44:31.962
<i>Hello?
Elizabeth?</i>

44:51.357 --> 44:54.693
- Where are you going?
- A friend of mine is in trouble.

44:54.902 --> 44:57.321
- What are we to do?
- Phone David Kibner.

44:57.488 --> 45:01.158
Ask him to meet me here right away.
There's his number.

45:01.325 --> 45:03.327
- What's the matter?
- I'm tired.

45:04.453 --> 45:06.121
Stand up.

45:06.288 --> 45:10.041
- Stand up! Now walk around!
- Honey, I'm dry! I'm very dry.

45:10.042 --> 45:12.795
I'll get you something to drink.
Just don't fall asleep.

45:12.961 --> 45:14.797
[police siren passes]

45:14.963 --> 45:16.799
[radio chatter]

45:22.471 --> 45:24.014
- Here, sweetie.
- Thanks, sweetie.

45:24.223 --> 45:26.225
Dr. Kibner will be here soon.

45:26.433 --> 45:29.186
Kibner, Kibner,
Kibner, Kibner.

45:30.396 --> 45:32.648
I'm gonna lie down and think, honey.

45:33.148 --> 45:35.150
I'm just gonna think.

46:20.362 --> 46:22.156
Jack!

46:22.364 --> 46:24.158
Jack! Jack!

46:24.533 --> 46:26.535
Jack, wake up! Its eyes!

46:26.744 --> 46:29.663
Oh, Jack.
It opened its eyes.

46:41.759 --> 46:43.010
See?

46:45.679 --> 46:46.930
Hon?

46:48.223 --> 46:50.017
Jack...

46:51.643 --> 46:54.354
- [gasps]
- Oh, Jack!

46:56.106 --> 46:57.775
[screams]

47:08.494 --> 47:10.621
[brakes screech]

47:27.429 --> 47:29.223
[lock rattles]

47:29.431 --> 47:31.225
[knocks]

50:07.714 --> 50:09.508
Elizabeth!

50:17.975 --> 50:19.768
[soft sigh]

50:23.981 --> 50:25.732
Elizabeth.

50:26.274 --> 50:27.651
Wake up.

50:28.110 --> 50:29.486
Wake up!

52:24.810 --> 52:27.437
[Geoffrey shrieks]

52:36.321 --> 52:39.783
I can't find anything in here
that looks like a body.

52:39.950 --> 52:41.743
- No body?
- What are you talking about?

52:41.910 --> 52:44.704
- Did you check the last--
- I looked everywhere.

52:44.871 --> 52:46.164
Hey! Did you... Hey!

52:46.373 --> 52:47.999
Did you check the
last booth on the left?

52:48.208 --> 52:50.043
There's no body there.

52:50.252 --> 52:52.212
It's got to be in here!

52:54.923 --> 52:58.343
- Did it have a pulse, a heartbeat?
- It opened its eyes.

52:58.510 --> 53:01.930
- You actually saw that?
- I saw its nose bleed.

53:02.347 --> 53:05.225
It had white hair
that touched my hand.

53:05.809 --> 53:07.811
There's something in here.

53:10.647 --> 53:14.192
Nancy lost an old guy in here once.
He had a heart attack and sank.

53:14.401 --> 53:16.194
Jack...

53:18.738 --> 53:20.323
Face it, Bellicec.

53:20.532 --> 53:23.368
You've got some friends
who enjoy playing practical jokes.

53:23.577 --> 53:26.163
I don't have any friends, Dr. Kibner.

53:26.955 --> 53:29.039
Then some enemies.

53:29.040 --> 53:30.292
Look.

53:34.254 --> 53:36.214
Who opened this up?

54:01.156 --> 54:03.575
Wait a second, wait a second.
Who is it?

54:06.745 --> 54:09.289
- Matthew, the body's gone.
- Somebody's took it.

54:09.497 --> 54:12.626
- No. Did you see it?
- There was nothing here to see.

54:13.418 --> 54:15.587
Who are you waking up now, Matthew?

54:15.754 --> 54:18.965
Police? I would like to report a body.

54:21.551 --> 54:23.511
Take her to my place fast.

54:23.678 --> 54:26.514
Don't let anybody in
until we get back there.

54:56.711 --> 54:59.130
[Cop]: Lieutenant, these are the
fellas that reported the body.

54:59.339 --> 55:00.590
[Cop #2]: You both saw it?

55:00.799 --> 55:02.592
[Matthew]: No, I'm the only one.
Matthew Bennell.

55:02.759 --> 55:05.387
Mr. Bennell, why don't you
show me where you saw it?

55:05.595 --> 55:06.846
It's right up here.

55:07.138 --> 55:09.140
Where's Elizabeth?

55:23.363 --> 55:24.781
- Where?
- There.

55:24.948 --> 55:27.033
- It's Elizabeth's double.
- Where, Matthew?

55:27.200 --> 55:29.119
Lots of leaves and a pot.

55:29.286 --> 55:32.706
It was there, David.
I swear to God it was there!

55:32.872 --> 55:34.040
Officer, there was a body in there.

55:34.207 --> 55:35.625
It was a duplicate
of Elizabeth Driscoll,

55:35.792 --> 55:37.961
- and it's been taken.
- The missing woman?

55:38.128 --> 55:39.963
- She's not missing.
- Where is she?

55:40.171 --> 55:42.507
- She's okay. She's at Matthew's.
- Don't tell him where she is.

55:42.716 --> 55:45.218
- Then there is no missing body.
- That's right.

55:45.427 --> 55:46.720
There is a missing body
and he's taken it away!

55:46.928 --> 55:47.971
No, he took Elizabeth.

55:48.179 --> 55:49.889
- You took Elizabeth Driscoll away?
- Yes!

55:50.056 --> 55:51.016
You broke in here.

55:51.224 --> 55:53.059
I had to because
she was not safe here.

55:53.226 --> 55:54.686
So then you took
Elizabeth Driscoll out of here.

55:54.894 --> 55:58.815
No! I took her from there.
Her other body was in here...

55:58.982 --> 56:01.651
Please stop.
Matthew, that's enough! Please stop!

56:01.860 --> 56:03.153
Lieutenant,
my name is Dr. David Kibner.

56:03.361 --> 56:04.863
- Ah, the psychiatrist.
- That's right.

56:05.030 --> 56:06.656
My wife reads your books.
It's changed her life.

56:06.865 --> 56:09.326
- I'm glad. It sounds complicated...
- David--

56:09.534 --> 56:11.995
but my friend has had some
difficult emotional experiences

56:12.203 --> 56:13.413
during the last couple of days.

56:13.621 --> 56:17.625
But I think this is something
we can work out amongst ourselves.

56:17.792 --> 56:20.420
All right, I'll leave
this part of it with you.

56:20.628 --> 56:21.421
I appreciate it.

56:21.629 --> 56:24.799
You can't accomplish anything here.
We gotta get outside.

56:24.966 --> 56:26.509
[all arguing]

56:26.718 --> 56:30.388
I think you might wanna consider
filing an unlawful entry

56:30.597 --> 56:31.806
against Mr Bennell.

56:31.973 --> 56:34.267
I know what you're saying,
I believe you, but outside...

56:34.434 --> 56:38.730
No, I'll take Dr. Kibner's word
that Elizabeth is all right.

56:39.481 --> 56:41.941
- Fine, then let's go.
- Okay.

56:46.071 --> 56:48.073
Will Elizabeth be coming home?

56:50.283 --> 56:51.409
No.

56:52.786 --> 56:55.080
I have to pick up some of her clothes.

56:57.999 --> 56:59.709
All right.

57:21.481 --> 57:23.400
[sirens]

57:27.862 --> 57:30.989
All right, let's back up
and go through it once more,

57:30.990 --> 57:33.243
step by step.

57:35.161 --> 57:38.164
You all thought you saw a body
at the baths.

57:38.373 --> 57:41.584
You thought it was dead.
You didn't know what it was.

57:43.878 --> 57:47.090
You touched it.
All of you touched it.

57:50.135 --> 57:54.431
- Nancy, you saw it open its eyes.
- It looked right at me.

57:56.433 --> 58:00.228
- And Bellicec, you saw its eyes open.
- No, I saw its nose bleed.

58:00.395 --> 58:03.690
If you saw its nose bleed,
and Nancy saw its eyes open,

58:03.898 --> 58:05.650
he must have been alive.

58:08.194 --> 58:09.446
No, David.
What you're doing wrong...

58:09.654 --> 58:11.865
You're looking at it as
if it was human. It was not human.

58:13.032 --> 58:16.703
- Matthew, what else would it be?
- It was something, but not human.

58:16.870 --> 58:19.038
- It had white hair on it.
- It was growing.

58:19.205 --> 58:20.790
The one at Jack's place was...

58:20.957 --> 58:24.544
It was like Jack, but not as developed
as the one at Elizabeth's place.

58:24.711 --> 58:26.504
It had tendrils on it.

58:26.671 --> 58:28.715
The one at Elizabeth's place
was duplicating her.

58:28.882 --> 58:30.884
If Matthew hadn't taken me
out of there,

58:31.050 --> 58:34.596
the same thing that's happened
to Geoffrey would have happened to me.

58:35.430 --> 58:37.265
Elizabeth, would you please tell me,
in your opinion,

58:37.474 --> 58:39.934
exactly what is happening?

58:42.353 --> 58:44.481
People are being duplicated.

58:45.648 --> 58:48.985
And once it's happened to you,
you're part of this thing.

58:50.403 --> 58:52.113
It almost happened to me!

58:53.698 --> 58:55.116
Look,

58:55.283 --> 59:00.330
the reason you don't believe Elizabeth
is because the other body disappeared.

59:00.538 --> 59:03.500
Now, it disappeared
because Geoffrey took it.

59:03.666 --> 59:06.294
Well, then what happened
to my other body, then?

59:06.461 --> 59:09.130
Oh, people,
will you please listen to yourselves?

59:09.339 --> 59:11.466
Will you please listen
to what you are saying?

59:11.633 --> 59:13.551
Look, I can deal with
a body being moved.

59:13.760 --> 59:16.513
I can even deal with
a body getting up and leaving,

59:16.721 --> 59:18.932
but when you start talking about
his other body, her other body,

59:19.140 --> 59:20.391
people being duplicated,

59:20.600 --> 59:22.268
will you listen to how that sounds?

59:22.435 --> 59:24.270
Don't you think we know
how insane this sounds?

59:24.479 --> 59:25.855
But what do you think we're doing?

59:26.022 --> 59:28.149
Do you think we're making it up?

59:28.316 --> 59:30.610
Do you believe that
my body looked like me

59:30.777 --> 59:32.570
and do you believe that
her body looked like her?

59:32.779 --> 59:34.364
[Elizabeth]: Do you think
we've all gone crazy?

59:34.572 --> 59:37.158
You are trying to make us believe
that we are seeing things.

59:37.367 --> 59:39.494
Why are you trying to do that?

59:39.702 --> 59:41.996
All I'm trying to do is help.

59:42.163 --> 59:43.665
You call me in the middle of the night

59:43.873 --> 59:45.083
and you ask me to
come here and help.

59:45.291 --> 59:46.292
That's all I'm trying to do.

59:46.501 --> 59:48.461
Well, I'm sorry if we woke you up
in the middle of the night!

59:48.628 --> 59:51.923
If we inconvenienced you,
I guess we owe you an apology.

59:52.090 --> 59:55.426
I mean, I mean...
I guess that's a rotten thing to do!

59:57.262 --> 59:59.264
You've upset my wife, too.

01:00:05.687 --> 01:00:08.565
David, I don't know what it is
or where it comes from,

01:00:08.773 --> 01:00:10.733
but it was there and
I saw it and I'm gonna fight it.

01:00:10.942 --> 01:00:14.153
Matthew, my friend... I believe you.

01:00:15.655 --> 01:00:18.116
I've known you too long
not to believe you.

01:00:18.283 --> 01:00:20.285
What do you wanna do?

01:00:20.493 --> 01:00:22.245
Well, if I could get official support,

01:00:22.453 --> 01:00:24.789
I'd institute the same kind
of emergency procedures

01:00:24.956 --> 01:00:27.667
that we use for a cholera epidemic
or legionnaires' disease.

01:00:27.834 --> 01:00:31.629
- What do you want me to do?
- Well, I can handle the Health Department.

01:00:31.796 --> 01:00:35.216
But if panic breaks out,
we'll need the police and the Guard,

01:00:35.425 --> 01:00:37.552
and that means the Mayor and...

01:00:38.595 --> 01:00:41.097
The Mayor's a patient of yours,
isn't he?

01:00:41.973 --> 01:00:43.933
How did you know that?

01:00:44.934 --> 01:00:46.894
What do you want me to do?

01:00:47.061 --> 01:00:49.480
Would you ask him
to accept my telephone call?

01:00:49.689 --> 01:00:51.482
I'll call him in a hour.
I'll be at my office.

01:00:51.691 --> 01:00:54.694
If you have any other ideas
get in touch.

01:00:54.902 --> 01:00:56.696
[distant car alarm]

01:00:57.030 --> 01:00:59.032
Call me.

01:01:00.575 --> 01:01:02.535
Thank you.

01:01:27.977 --> 01:01:29.979
The sooner the better.

01:01:32.732 --> 01:01:34.442
This smells lovely.

01:01:34.609 --> 01:01:37.820
- Now I want you to listen to me.
- I am listening to you, Nancy.

01:01:37.987 --> 01:01:41.616
I am not seeing things.
I know I saw what I saw

01:01:41.824 --> 01:01:43.826
and I know it was
turning into you, Jack.

01:01:44.035 --> 01:01:45.620
Alright, now that body we found...

01:01:45.828 --> 01:01:48.081
That flower.
Where did you get that?

01:01:48.247 --> 01:01:51.250
- In the vase with the others.
- Just stuck in there?

01:01:51.459 --> 01:01:54.796
- Yeah. Why?
- Geoffrey gave me one last night.

01:01:54.962 --> 01:01:56.046
So what?

01:01:56.047 --> 01:01:59.050
There was a customer, Mr Gianni.
He brought one of those to the baths.

01:01:59.258 --> 01:02:00.051
So what?

01:02:00.259 --> 01:02:03.221
- Put it down, Jack.
- It's a pod with a flower on it.

01:02:03.388 --> 01:02:06.182
I could not find that flower
in any of the books I looked in.

01:02:06.391 --> 01:02:07.100
Jack, put it down.

01:02:07.266 --> 01:02:10.895
- It's a pink flower, honey.
- It could be toxic.

01:02:11.062 --> 01:02:12.939
Look, I have seen
these flowers all over.

01:02:13.106 --> 01:02:15.191
They're growing like parasites
on other plants. All of a sudden...

01:02:15.358 --> 01:02:17.568
- Where are they coming from?
- Outer space.

01:02:17.777 --> 01:02:20.071
- They're not from outer space.
- Why not, Jack?

01:02:20.238 --> 01:02:21.698
- They're not from outer space, Nancy.
- Why?!

01:02:21.906 --> 01:02:24.075
What are you talking about?
A space flower?

01:02:25.284 --> 01:02:29.079
Why not a space flower?
Why do we always expect metal ships?

01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:31.249
I've never expected metal ships.

01:02:31.457 --> 01:02:33.960
Look, there's bound to be other ways
they can get in our system.

01:02:34.127 --> 01:02:36.212
That's right, they could be
getting into us through touch

01:02:36.421 --> 01:02:37.505
or through their fragrance.

01:02:37.672 --> 01:02:41.175
We would never even notice it,
not from the impurities we have.

01:02:41.384 --> 01:02:44.011
I mean, we eat junk
and we breathe junk.

01:02:44.220 --> 01:02:46.514
I don't know where
they're coming from,

01:02:46.723 --> 01:02:48.975
but I know I feel as though
I've been poisoned today.

01:02:49.183 --> 01:02:51.144
We've gotta take those flowers in
and have them analyzed.

01:02:51.352 --> 01:02:53.396
This is the only thing we know.
There's something here.

01:02:53.604 --> 01:02:55.440
[Nancy]: They could start
getting into our systems

01:02:55.606 --> 01:02:59.610
and screwing up our genes like DNA,
recombining us, change us.

01:02:59.819 --> 01:03:01.237
Oh, of course!

01:03:01.404 --> 01:03:03.364
This is the same way
those rocket ships landed

01:03:03.573 --> 01:03:04.449
thousands of years ago,

01:03:04.657 --> 01:03:08.911
so those spacemen could mate with
monkeys and create the human race.

01:03:09.078 --> 01:03:11.497
It's happening now!

01:03:21.340 --> 01:03:23.301
<i>[Woman]: Hello,
who do you wish to speak to?</i>

01:03:23.509 --> 01:03:24.635
David Kibner.

01:03:24.844 --> 01:03:27.597
<i>He's not in right now.
He'll be back later this afternoon.</i>

01:03:27.805 --> 01:03:29.390
Well could you leave
a message for him, please?

01:03:29.599 --> 01:03:32.518
Would you say Matthew Bennell?
B-E-N-N-E-L-L.

01:03:32.727 --> 01:03:35.897
- And your number, please?
- No, he's got my number. Thank you.

01:03:38.024 --> 01:03:40.526
[dialing]

01:03:40.735 --> 01:03:43.196
[dial tone]

01:03:43.404 --> 01:03:46.032
<i>James Grala, Deputy City Attorney.
Can I help you?</i>

01:03:46.199 --> 01:03:47.825
Yes, my name is Matthew Bennell.

01:03:47.992 --> 01:03:51.537
B-E-N-N-E-L-L.
I'm a deputy public health inspector.

01:03:51.746 --> 01:03:53.706
<i>Is this another
call about impostors?</i>

01:03:53.915 --> 01:03:54.749
Yes.

01:03:54.957 --> 01:03:57.084
- We're the first agency you called?
- Yes.

01:03:57.293 --> 01:04:00.171
<i>Good. Listen, Mr. Bennell,
we don't wanna create a panic.</i>

01:04:00.379 --> 01:04:02.089
No one in my department knows.

01:04:02.298 --> 01:04:04.759
<i>Look, Mr. Bennell, I'm gonna ask
you to stay by your phone for a while.</i>

01:04:04.926 --> 01:04:07.929
<i>I'll have somebody call you back
and take down all you know.</i>

01:04:08.137 --> 01:04:09.931
All right, thank you.

01:04:12.308 --> 01:04:15.186
This is a busy lab, Elizabeth.
We're not supposed to test flowers.

01:04:15.394 --> 01:04:17.396
They go to the Depart of Agriculture.

01:04:17.605 --> 01:04:18.689
I know where they go!

01:04:18.940 --> 01:04:22.610
I think this is our problem.
I think it is affecting people.

01:04:23.027 --> 01:04:24.737
How?

01:04:27.031 --> 01:04:30.451
Look, Allen, I have already said
that I'm gonna do all the testing.

01:04:30.660 --> 01:04:32.954
You don't have to lift a finger.
Can I?

01:04:33.871 --> 01:04:36.165
You've been consistently late,
Elizabeth,

01:04:36.374 --> 01:04:38.042
and you're behind in your work,

01:04:38.251 --> 01:04:40.211
so I'll do the tests for you.

01:04:41.379 --> 01:04:43.047
Thank you.

01:04:43.256 --> 01:04:46.300
- It'll take 48 hours.
- Allen, 24.

01:04:47.593 --> 01:04:52.265
I can't understand why you've become
so emotional about a little flower.

01:04:53.558 --> 01:04:55.810
[phone rings]

01:04:56.435 --> 01:04:57.395
Hello.

01:04:57.562 --> 01:04:58.729
- Mr. Bennell?
- Yes.

01:04:58.938 --> 01:05:00.857
- You're with the Health Department?
- Yes.

01:05:01.023 --> 01:05:04.026
<i>This is Ted Jessop,
the Mayor's special assistant.</i>

01:05:04.235 --> 01:05:06.237

strange in the last few days?</i>

01:05:06.445 --> 01:05:07.071
Yes.

<i>I'd like to suggest that
we meet in Union Square.</i>

01:05:09.991 --> 01:05:12.869
<i>- We can't talk over the phone.
- Right away.</i>

01:05:15.121 --> 01:05:17.790
So you'll meet me here again tomorrow,
right, Mr. Bennell?

01:05:17.957 --> 01:05:18.791
Yeah.

01:05:18.958 --> 01:05:21.085
Don't say a word to anyone.
Keep it quiet.

01:05:21.294 --> 01:05:23.254
Whatever you say.

01:05:29.176 --> 01:05:32.805
- Please deposit 15 cents.

<i>we're asking for your
discretion from now on</i>

might be abating.</i>

- Yes.

<i>I'm Michaels. I'm with the
Federal Preparedness Agency.</i>

01:06:05.796 --> 01:06:08.674
<i>My understanding is that you
haven't actually analyzed anything</i>

- and you have no tissue samples.
- No, I'm...

just winging your conclusions.</i>

<i>Please keep an open mind.</i>

01:06:15.848 --> 01:06:17.224
I had no intention at all of...

01:06:17.391 --> 01:06:20.019
Don't mention to anyone
about duplicate bodies.

01:06:20.186 --> 01:06:21.562
I was gonna treat it--

<i>Excuse me, my other phone is ringing.

<i>[Woman]: This is serious business,
Mr. Bennell.</i>

<i>Is this just a case of paranoia,
Mr. Bennell?</i>

01:06:31.656 --> 01:06:32.448
No, no, no.

looks like, Mr. Bennell?</i>

No, no.
She all right.

She better now.
Much better now.

01:06:58.057 --> 01:06:59.767
Did your husband
ask you to come here?

No, no.

that I'm back to myself again.

01:07:04.981 --> 01:07:06.732
No, wait. Please.

01:07:06.941 --> 01:07:09.485
I'll see you soon, I hope.

Where is the...
I'm not getting any news here.

01:07:55.531 --> 01:07:58.200
Isn't there a 24-hour news?

01:07:58.993 --> 01:08:01.746
I would think you'd have very
good reception up here on the hill.

01:08:01.954 --> 01:08:03.414
There's a repair truck out here.

01:08:03.622 --> 01:08:05.416
Could that have
anything to do with it?

01:09:11.649 --> 01:09:13.818
I would suggest you
get some sleep, too.

01:09:14.026 --> 01:09:16.153
You've done everything
you possibly can.

01:09:19.865 --> 01:09:22.326
Can I give the Bellicecs a ride?

01:09:23.077 --> 01:09:25.036
No, I'm not going back there.

01:09:25.037 --> 01:09:27.872
- We'll just get a motel.
- You can stay here.

01:09:29.792 --> 01:09:31.127
Thank you.

01:09:31.961 --> 01:09:33.712
Come on.

01:09:33.879 --> 01:09:37.299
I appreciate everything you've done,
David. Thank you.

Hang up, Matthew.

- I didn't tell you my name!
- Hang up.

01:15:39.036 --> 01:15:42.915
- I didn't tell them my name!
- They're all a part of it.

01:15:44.458 --> 01:15:46.502
They're all pods, all of them.

01:15:48.962 --> 01:15:51.340
- Who are you calling?
- Washington.

They're pods already.

01:15:53.717 --> 01:15:56.386
I've got a friend in
the Justice Department.

01:15:56.595 --> 01:15:57.596

No.

everywhere. Have you seen him?

01:35:49.620 --> 01:35:51.330
How?

Don't show any emotions.
Hide your feelings.
