WEBVTT

00:19.066 --> 00:22.778
Don't like this.
Something's going down.

00:34.748 --> 00:37.251
Tri Corp Dispatch,
this is Transport 23.

00:37.417 --> 00:41.004
Tri Corp, do you read?

00:53.433 --> 00:55.102
There you go, Hammerhead.

00:55.269 --> 00:57.271
- Job done.
- Forget the hat.

00:57.729 --> 00:59.064
Put on the suit.

00:59.231 --> 01:00.941
You still owe the Big Man...

01:01.108 --> 01:05.612
...one friendly
neighborhood Spider-Man.

02:10.636 --> 02:14.848
Peter, dear, are you up?
Come on, Mr. Lazy-Bones.

02:15.015 --> 02:18.477
- Aunt May, I'm not decent.
- All right, calm down.

02:20.145 --> 02:23.649
There's breakfast waiting downstairs.
I'll be at Mrs. Watson's.

02:27.402 --> 02:28.737
Waffles.

02:31.365 --> 02:36.912
<i>Bills. Gas, phone, electric.
All past due.</i>

02:37.079 --> 02:38.330
Oh, good, you're up.

02:38.497 --> 02:41.583
I've just been visiting with Anna
and her niece, Mary Jane.

02:41.750 --> 02:44.419
A lovely girl.
Peter, you must meet her.

02:45.379 --> 02:49.549
- What's she like?
- She has a wonderful personality.

02:50.717 --> 02:52.594
She's there.
Why don't we head over--?

02:52.761 --> 02:53.762
I'd love to, Aunt May.

02:53.929 --> 02:55.889
But I promised Harry
I'd help him study...

02:56.056 --> 02:58.183
...and I can't miss the bus. Bye.

03:00.268 --> 03:03.105
- I so have to get me some hands-free.
- What?

03:03.271 --> 03:05.691
Nothing, bro.
Just trying to do too much at once.

03:05.857 --> 03:09.069
Like selling pictures to the <i>Bugle</i>
instead of helping your friends?

03:09.236 --> 03:12.656
Look, straight up, I blew it.
And I know you're ticked--

03:12.823 --> 03:15.033
Don't go all emo on me, bro.
I'll get over it.

03:15.200 --> 03:19.246
- Just back off for a while.
- Got it. And thanks.

03:19.413 --> 03:21.415
Target spotted.

03:21.581 --> 03:24.418
And target lost.
But he's in the area, boss.

03:32.718 --> 03:35.887
Peter. Good to see you.
Here to help Harry, huh?

03:36.054 --> 03:37.723
We help each other, Mr. O.

03:37.889 --> 03:41.059
Now, now, Peter,
modesty doesn't become men like us.

03:41.226 --> 03:44.896
Smart, driven,
responsible, self-made.

03:45.063 --> 03:50.819
- I'm more of a work in progress.
- At least you're making progress.

03:55.449 --> 03:56.742
Mind if I check my e-mail?

03:59.327 --> 04:02.080
An Evite
to Midtown High's fall formal?

04:02.247 --> 04:05.125
Which would rock if either of us had--
What's the word?

04:05.292 --> 04:07.085
A "date"?

04:07.252 --> 04:09.379
Could probably ask
Mary Jane Watson.

04:09.546 --> 04:10.672
Mary who-what-now?

04:10.839 --> 04:13.091
Oh, this girl
Aunt May wants me to meet.

04:13.258 --> 04:16.261
Get this,
she has a wonderful personality.

04:16.928 --> 04:18.805
I was thinking about asking Gwen.

04:18.971 --> 04:21.975
- Just as a friend, you know.
- Well, actually, I wouldn't know.

04:22.142 --> 04:24.478
Miss Stacy's currently
not speaking to me.

04:24.644 --> 04:27.189
"From the desk
of J. Jonah Jameson"?

04:27.355 --> 04:29.983
<i>Whoa, publisher of the Daily Bugle.</i>

04:30.150 --> 04:32.027
"Mr. Parker, come in ASAP...

04:32.194 --> 04:34.821
...to claim paycheck
for photos of Spider-Man."

04:34.988 --> 04:36.281
Yes!

04:36.448 --> 04:39.367
Dude, sorry. I'll be back in an hour.
Two tops, promise.

04:39.534 --> 04:41.453
Wait.
What do I do while you're gone?

04:41.620 --> 04:44.331
Chapters one through six. Review.

04:45.999 --> 04:49.294
Did a caveman proofread this piece?
Where's my sports editor?

04:49.461 --> 04:53.340
I want him in my office in 14 seconds.
And where's my coffee?

04:53.507 --> 04:55.717
- Sir? I'm Peter--
- I know who you are.

04:55.884 --> 04:58.553
You're the know-nothing
who wasted 41 seconds of my time.

04:58.720 --> 05:00.972
Well, I haven't got
another 41 to spare.

05:01.139 --> 05:03.225
- But-- But--
- Brilliant comeback, kid.

05:03.391 --> 05:06.394
Now, where's that Parker guy?
I e-mailed him 76 minutes ago.

05:06.561 --> 05:08.396
Won't anybody get me my coffee?

05:08.605 --> 05:10.649
Coffee, decaf.
It's only been 20 minutes.

05:10.816 --> 05:13.735
And I'm pretty sure
you just kicked Peter Parker out.

05:14.611 --> 05:17.906
Well, don't just stand there,
get him back.

05:18.406 --> 05:23.870
Oh, that wasn't too humiliating.
Wait. My money.

05:28.750 --> 05:30.252
Sorry about that, Parker.

05:30.418 --> 05:33.713
Was expecting someone old enough
to have, you know, armpit hair.

05:33.880 --> 05:35.757
Now, that costumed freak
sells papers.

05:35.924 --> 05:38.385
I want another set of pics
in my hands by deadline.

05:38.552 --> 05:41.805
- You got two hours.
<i>- I'll</i> do my best, but--

05:41.972 --> 05:46.226
You still here? What do you want,
a medal? Get out! Out!

05:46.393 --> 05:48.103
I'll cut that check for you, Peter.

05:48.270 --> 05:49.896
- Thanks, Miss Brant.
- I'm Betty.

05:50.063 --> 05:53.733
So, Betty, how do you work
for a walking embolism like Jameson?

05:53.900 --> 05:56.653
Mr. Jameson's a decent man
down deep.

05:56.820 --> 06:00.574
We talking Marianas Trench deep,
or Dante's ninth circle deep?

06:01.741 --> 06:04.703
See you soon, Peter Parker.

06:08.123 --> 06:11.209
He's back. Set it in motion.

06:14.963 --> 06:16.965
Talk about a crook with bad timing.

06:20.802 --> 06:24.306
Great, he's on us. Now, not too fast.
If he loses us, no payday.

06:24.472 --> 06:27.225
Oh, forget the payday.
I want payback.

06:35.817 --> 06:38.153
Two hours till deadline? No sweat.

06:39.946 --> 06:42.490
Don't want anything
to happen to this.

06:48.455 --> 06:51.666
Marko? How many times
do I have to take you down?

06:51.833 --> 06:54.461
And where's
your charming partner, O'Hirn?

06:57.005 --> 07:01.468
Look, we gotta stop meeting like this.
People are starting to talk.

07:01.635 --> 07:03.511
Mostly about what doofs you are.

07:08.183 --> 07:12.062
I reckon that came
as a bit of a shocker, eh, bug?

07:12.228 --> 07:16.024
Well, good. So will this.

07:29.412 --> 07:32.415
Hold still, son,
so I can put you out of your misery.

07:32.582 --> 07:35.293
How about you put me out
of my mystery? Who are you?

07:35.460 --> 07:40.090
Call me--
Well, how's about "Shocker"?

07:40.256 --> 07:43.218
Or how's about "Toast"?

07:45.929 --> 07:48.974
Either you got less kick
than a three-legged mule...

07:49.140 --> 07:52.769
...or this here suit does more
than protect me from my own power.

07:52.936 --> 07:55.230
I guess clothes do make the man.

08:06.658 --> 08:12.163
- Did I get him? Tell me I got him.
- All you got is on my nerves.

08:13.623 --> 08:16.251
Now, stay out of this, boy.
The grown-ups were talking.

08:16.418 --> 08:20.922
Don't be too mad at O'Hirn.
He just gets cranky without his n--

08:24.259 --> 08:27.303
Impressive. You could
hire yourself out as a kiddie ride.

08:27.470 --> 08:28.638
Thanks.

08:31.683 --> 08:34.144
But I already got a job I love.

08:57.167 --> 09:00.128
That should satisfy the Big Man.
Extraction.

09:00.295 --> 09:03.506
- Hey, a little help?
- I ought to leave you for the cops.

09:03.673 --> 09:06.342
But I'm in too good a mood.

09:26.821 --> 09:30.867
- Did I get him? Is he roadkill?
- He's finito. Let's book.

09:39.709 --> 09:44.547
Talk about your tight spots.
But I'm alive.

09:46.174 --> 09:47.217
And I reek.

09:50.011 --> 09:53.598
And my paycheck's ruined. Perfect.

09:55.850 --> 09:58.603
- Harry, I'm sorry.
- Sorry? You totally left me hanging.

09:58.770 --> 10:00.605
I know you can do calc
in your sleep...

10:00.772 --> 10:03.399
...but I've got a lot riding
on tomorrow's test.

10:03.566 --> 10:08.363
- Maybe I should ask Gwen.
- No, I'm down for tonight, I swear.

10:08.863 --> 10:10.865
Carpe ropem?

10:19.082 --> 10:22.252
Guess all Osborn's money
couldn't buy him muscle tone.

10:22.418 --> 10:24.587
Lay off, Flash.
You think you could do better?

10:24.754 --> 10:27.590
How about you and me race?
First to the top wins.

10:27.757 --> 10:30.301
Dude, Parker's calling you out.

10:30.510 --> 10:33.429
<i>And my spider powers
are gonna send you home crying.</i>

10:34.097 --> 10:36.099
- Ball, please.
- All right, all right.

10:36.266 --> 10:38.601
A little friendly competition
never hurt anyone.

10:38.768 --> 10:40.311
Line up.

10:43.940 --> 10:45.775
Forget it. You win.

10:45.942 --> 10:47.819
Usually, when I say
puny Parker stinks...

10:47.986 --> 10:50.280
...it's a figure of speech, but:

10:50.738 --> 10:53.449
<i>Yeah, and I showered three times
last night.</i>

10:53.616 --> 10:55.451
Peter, throw me the ball.

10:58.413 --> 11:00.081
Gwen, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

11:00.248 --> 11:03.293
- You turned at the last se--
- Parker, hit the showers.

11:03.459 --> 11:07.422
- Yeah, for all our sakes.
- Yeah.

11:08.798 --> 11:12.969
- Pete, are you wearing perfume?
- It's a long story.

11:13.136 --> 11:15.305
Look, Miss Bra-- I mean, Betty.

11:15.471 --> 11:18.808
This is embarrassing,
but could you replace my check?

11:18.975 --> 11:20.768
It got trashed.

11:20.935 --> 11:24.314
Well, sure. Oh, you have to meet
our editor in chief.

11:24.480 --> 11:28.651
- Joe Robertson, this is Peter Parker.
- The photographer, right.

11:28.818 --> 11:31.696
Call me Robbie. Any new shots?

11:33.823 --> 11:35.658
Do you know a Rand Robertson?

11:35.825 --> 11:37.660
Well, there is a kid by that name...

11:37.827 --> 11:40.371
...who lives in my house
and eats all my food.

11:40.580 --> 11:41.873
- You at Midtown?
- Yes, sir.

11:42.081 --> 11:44.500
Good school.
The fact that you've twice gotten...

11:44.667 --> 11:47.545
...any usable pictures of Spider-Man
is pretty amazing.

11:47.712 --> 11:49.214
But the photos themselves...

11:49.380 --> 11:52.258
- You have your camera on you?
- She's hard to keep in focus.

11:52.425 --> 11:54.886
This won't cut it.
You wanna be a <i>Bugle</i> freelancer...

11:55.094 --> 11:57.847
...you take that check
and invest in a serious camera.

11:58.014 --> 12:03.311
Garbage. Garbage. Literally garbage.
Garba-- Wait.

12:04.854 --> 12:07.857
Wouldn't you rather use one
where Spider-Man's winning?

12:08.024 --> 12:10.235
Shows what you know.
Nobody loves a winner.

12:10.401 --> 12:13.529
The people are our market.
The people want their heroes to fail.

12:13.696 --> 12:16.199
Makes them feel good
about themselves.

12:16.741 --> 12:19.494
Piece of advice, kid:
Perfume doesn't cut it.

12:19.661 --> 12:23.623
Tomato juice. Only thing
after taking pictures at a dump.

12:24.207 --> 12:26.709
<i>I so need an excuse
to get back to Betty.</i>

12:26.876 --> 12:29.045
<i>Which means
I need to take more pictures.</i>

12:29.212 --> 12:32.173
<i>Which means
I cashed in my checks because--</i>

12:32.340 --> 12:36.052
- I need to buy a new camera.
- We're closed. Go away.

12:36.219 --> 12:38.680
The sign says
you don't close for another hour.

12:38.846 --> 12:41.641
The sign's wrong.
Come back tomorrow.

12:43.726 --> 12:45.812
I'm telling you, we gotta cash in fast.

12:45.979 --> 12:48.564
Once Hammerhead spreads the word
Spider-Man's croaked...

12:48.731 --> 12:51.901
...it'll be open season
for every hood in the city.

12:52.443 --> 12:56.906
Still can't believe
I didn't cash in his chips myself.

12:58.283 --> 13:01.160
- Something smells bad.
- Oh, still?

13:01.327 --> 13:03.121
I washed this costume five times.

13:03.288 --> 13:05.081
- You.
- And now that you troglodytes...

13:05.248 --> 13:08.918
...have deduced that the rumors of
my demise have been exaggerated...

13:10.169 --> 13:11.754
I'm not dead.

13:12.422 --> 13:14.882
Never mind.
Just tell Shocker I want a rematch.

13:15.049 --> 13:19.762
- You can call the cops now.
- Oh, I really, really hate that guy.

13:19.929 --> 13:24.267
This is really, really getting heavy.

13:25.268 --> 13:28.563
Hey, Aunt May.
I'm home before the new curfew.

13:28.730 --> 13:32.066
That's appreciated, Peter.
I'm almost done here.

13:32.233 --> 13:33.276
Just paying bills.

13:33.443 --> 13:36.612
Or rather, deciding which ones
I can hold off paying.

13:36.779 --> 13:39.615
Well, I think I might...

13:40.783 --> 13:43.286
...hold off on the gas bill.

13:44.495 --> 13:49.292
- I feel like banana cake. You?
- No. Thanks.

13:49.459 --> 13:53.463
- I think I'll just hit the sheets.
- What? No banana cake?

13:53.629 --> 13:56.299
Helping Harry
must've really tuckered you out.

13:56.466 --> 14:00.136
Oh, man. Harry. I totally--

14:00.303 --> 14:02.096
- Blew me off, Pete.
- I know, Har.

14:02.263 --> 14:06.476
- Look, I'm worthless, but--
- But nothing. "Worthless" covers it.

14:07.101 --> 14:08.353
Let me get this straight.

14:08.519 --> 14:11.356
You ditched out
on the only guy in the whole school...

14:11.522 --> 14:15.651
...who actually liked you? Genius.

14:25.953 --> 14:29.791
- Big Man's not satisfied, Montana.
- And Why would that be?

14:29.957 --> 14:35.004
He don't think
you lived up to your responsibilities.

14:36.255 --> 14:38.132
The new camera
should make Robbie happy.

14:38.299 --> 14:40.218
And, of course,
if I happen to run into--

14:40.385 --> 14:42.637
- Miss Bra-- Betty.
- Oh, hi, Peter.

14:42.804 --> 14:44.889
Perfect timing. Hold this.

14:45.056 --> 14:47.058
You know,
we should do this more often.

14:47.266 --> 14:50.186
I mean, you and I
have so much in common.

14:50.353 --> 14:53.481
We both put mustard
on our hot dogs.

14:53.648 --> 14:57.902
We both work for jolly Jonah,
and that's a treat, believe me.

14:58.069 --> 15:02.907
Anyway, I was wondering,
would you like to go to my fall formal?

15:03.074 --> 15:06.035
- With me, that is.
- Your fall formal?

15:06.202 --> 15:10.873
Yeah. At my high school.
In the gymnasium.

15:12.208 --> 15:16.712
So is that deafening silence a yes?

15:16.879 --> 15:21.759
It's a very sweet offer,
but I'm just too old for you, Peter.

15:21.926 --> 15:25.888
It's just a dance. A little rock 'n' roll.

15:29.058 --> 15:31.144
Okay, I didn't mean it like that.

15:33.062 --> 15:34.230
Graphic's already online.

15:34.397 --> 15:37.191
Lee, get me damage reports.
Foswell, take the science angle.

15:37.358 --> 15:39.068
Manhattan's not known
for earthquakes.

15:39.235 --> 15:40.820
That was the third tremor.

15:40.987 --> 15:43.030
<i>Tremor? Or Shocker?</i>

15:45.741 --> 15:50.246
<i>Epicenter's equally spaced.
A straight line heading uptown.</i>

15:50.413 --> 15:51.581
<i>These aren't quakes.</i>

15:51.747 --> 15:55.251
<i>They're Shocker's trail
of breadcrumbs for yours truly.</i>

15:55.418 --> 15:59.755
<i>And I think I know
where to find his gingerbread house.</i>

16:08.264 --> 16:10.933
Here, Shocky, Shocky, Shocky.

16:14.604 --> 16:16.939
Really thought I'd ended you,
old son.

16:17.106 --> 16:19.901
But you got more lives
than a bag of cats.

16:20.067 --> 16:23.696
Still, I reckon
we can remedy that situation.

16:28.951 --> 16:31.621
One more at close range
ought to do it.

16:49.889 --> 16:51.682
I do admire your spunk, son.

16:51.849 --> 16:55.811
Not enough to let you go, of course.
That'd be bad for business.

17:02.401 --> 17:04.654
- Whose business?
- Can't tell you the who.

17:04.819 --> 17:05.863
Then tell me the why.

17:06.030 --> 17:08.907
What'd your friendly neighborhood
Spider-Man ever do to you?

17:09.075 --> 17:10.535
It ain't nothing personal, hoss.

17:10.742 --> 17:14.372
Simple truth is, if a man's a man,
he honors his responsibilities...

17:14.539 --> 17:16.874
...and you're one of mine.

17:33.266 --> 17:35.184
Well, the place is condemned.

17:39.522 --> 17:43.401
You know, it really ain't wise
to make a dangerous man look foolish.

17:43.609 --> 17:47.238
You don't need my help for that.
You looked in a mirror lately?

17:49.574 --> 17:52.410
Boy, talk about incompetent.
You've had more shots at me...

17:52.577 --> 17:54.912
...than Marko and O'Hirn,
and done about as well.

17:55.079 --> 17:58.958
Them boys are punks.
This is my profession.

18:00.334 --> 18:02.211
You do this for a living?

18:02.378 --> 18:05.089
With that accent,
I was thinking rodeo clown.

18:05.256 --> 18:10.386
- Don't you mock me, boy.
- I mock. I'm a mocker.

18:11.345 --> 18:14.765
Also a puller, a tugger, a yanker.

18:45.004 --> 18:48.841
And that's what they call
bringing down the house.

18:56.432 --> 19:00.019
- You seem troubled, son.
- Troubled? Gee, you think?

19:00.186 --> 19:02.480
I failed my calc test
because Pete abandoned me.

19:02.647 --> 19:05.024
- Flash's crowd won't cut me a break.
- Enough.

19:05.191 --> 19:08.527
You're parked in a no-whining zone.
Take some responsibility.

19:08.694 --> 19:12.031
Peter's not the reason you failed.
You wanna pass a test, study.

19:12.198 --> 19:16.661
You wanna be popular, be popular.
Take control of your destiny, boy.

19:17.078 --> 19:19.872
Harry, life's pretty simple.

19:20.039 --> 19:23.000
You cowboy up
and do what you have to do.

19:25.628 --> 19:29.006
Thanks. I will.

19:29.423 --> 19:33.803
- My apologies for the interruption.
- Kids today. What you gonna do?

19:34.220 --> 19:38.683
New topic: Spider-Man.
We want him gone.

19:38.849 --> 19:40.393
- You care?
- None of my business.

19:40.559 --> 19:42.561
Really? Hero saved your hide.

19:42.728 --> 19:46.065
I have nothing to do with Spider-Man.
I wouldn't have risked tipping you off...

19:46.232 --> 19:48.818
-...to that Tri Corp shipment if I had.
- Why did you tip us off?

19:48.984 --> 19:52.863
Tri Corp's my competitor
in the super-mercenary field.

19:53.030 --> 19:56.409
If their prototypes go missing,
everyone wins.

19:56.575 --> 20:00.246
Which brings up an issue
my boss would like to discuss.

20:00.413 --> 20:02.915
Go ahead, Big Man.

20:03.082 --> 20:05.710
<i>Mr. Osborn, we have a proposition.</i>

20:05.876 --> 20:08.421
<i>When Spider-Man battles
the likes of the Vulture...</i>

20:08.587 --> 20:11.090
<i>...the Lizard, and even our Shocker...</i>

20:11.257 --> 20:14.552
<i>...he's too busy
to interfere with my empire.</i>

20:14.719 --> 20:17.763
<i>We would like to hire you
to create more, well...</i>

20:17.930 --> 20:21.434
<i>-...let's call them "super-villains. "
- What's in it for me'?</i>

20:21.600 --> 20:25.229
<i>Ample funding and a ready supply
of human guinea pigs...</i>

20:25.396 --> 20:29.734
<i>...for your more questionable
experiments.</i>

20:37.283 --> 20:40.077
Ned Lee, the <i>Bugle.</i>
What is it? What's the card say?

20:44.498 --> 20:47.376
Robbie, it's me. I'm here.
But I need a phot0g--

20:47.543 --> 20:50.212
- Wait, what?
- I said Parker was there.

20:50.379 --> 20:54.550
Already e-mailed his shots.
Kid still needs a new camera.

20:56.385 --> 20:58.846
- What's this?
- The <i>Bugle</i> paid me for my pictures.

20:59.013 --> 21:02.099
- Now you can pay those bills.
- Out of the question.

21:02.266 --> 21:06.061
Besides, if you're gonna take photos
for the Bugle, you need a new camera.

21:06.228 --> 21:09.440
Well, that thought occurred.

21:09.607 --> 21:12.359
But a man has to honor
his responsibilities.

21:12.526 --> 21:17.114
You're one of mine.
Aunt May, please, let me help.

21:17.281 --> 21:20.951
I accept, if you agree to set aside
10 percent of every check...

21:21.118 --> 21:24.121
...to save for that camera. Deal?

21:24.288 --> 21:25.831
Deal.

21:27.541 --> 21:32.505
Peter, dear,
why do you smell like tomato juice?
