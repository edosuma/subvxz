[theme music playing]

01:01.019 --> 01:03.104
-[camera beeps]
-[muffled rustling]

01:06.066 --> 01:08.568
[camera whirring]

01:12.697 --> 01:15.116
-[watch beeps]
-[camera whirs]

01:15.366 --> 01:19.496
Hello. This is Lieutenant Ryan Kinkade,
MFE pilot.

01:19.996 --> 01:23.166
The time is 0600 hours.
It's day 47.

01:23.583 --> 01:26.795
And this is a glimpse at day-to-day life
aboard the IGF Atlas.

01:30.089 --> 01:31.841
[man snoring]

01:31.925 --> 01:35.428
Last night, I unpacked my video gear
and decided to document the crew.

01:35.845 --> 01:37.305
-[spits]
-[water runs]

01:38.807 --> 01:41.643
I know it seems strange,
but before Earth was attacked,

01:41.726 --> 01:43.603
I didn't go anywhere without my camera.

01:44.521 --> 01:47.982
[panting] Back home, people asked me
why I liked recording things.

01:48.650 --> 01:50.902
They also asked me
why I didn't talk that much.

01:51.236 --> 01:54.197
To both of those things,
I'd always say... [grunts]

01:56.282 --> 01:59.828
[Kinkade] ...28, 29, 30.

02:01.788 --> 02:03.790
You're recording? Why?

02:04.332 --> 02:06.126
Kinkade has always been, uh...

02:06.209 --> 02:10.380
an individual who's most comfortable
observing and reflecting on life.

02:10.755 --> 02:13.675
Being a fighter pilot
was actually his backup plan.

02:15.677 --> 02:16.553
It's true.

02:16.970 --> 02:20.265
I learned to shoot with a camera
before I learned to shoot with a rifle.

02:20.598 --> 02:22.934
I guess filming is just a small piece
of the larger puzzle

02:23.017 --> 02:24.936
that makes up the picture of who I am.

02:26.896 --> 02:27.897
[watch beeps]

02:31.484 --> 02:33.945
-[watch beeping]
-Hmm.

02:35.280 --> 02:36.531
[camera whirring]

02:42.203 --> 02:43.580
[camera beeps, whirs]

02:48.793 --> 02:50.169
-[electricity crackles]
-Ah!

02:56.301 --> 02:58.928
So, you're really shooting
another documentary?

02:59.345 --> 03:02.724
Please tell me this is going to be
more exciting than that project you did

03:02.807 --> 03:05.852
for Mr. Pollard's biology class
about yeast.

03:06.352 --> 03:08.813
That was actually
about the process of fermentation.

03:08.897 --> 03:10.940
Yeast converts carbohydrates
into carbon diox--

03:11.024 --> 03:13.318
Boring! Okay, look,
if this little documentary

03:13.401 --> 03:16.654
is how history will remember us,
I'm gonna help you spruce it up!

03:17.030 --> 03:18.156
How many cameras do you have?

03:18.239 --> 03:20.783
What's your visual effects budget?
Do you have any smoke bombs?

03:20.867 --> 03:21.868
[Kinkade groans]

03:22.911 --> 03:24.913
[camera whirring]

03:26.331 --> 03:27.874
[Kinkade] Okay, we're set.

03:27.957 --> 03:30.126
[Rizavi] So, catch us up
on what's going on.

03:30.209 --> 03:33.463
Right. Well, the Atlas is headed
to the Grei-Aye system

03:33.546 --> 03:36.341
where we've identified the remains
of a disabled Robeast.

03:36.841 --> 03:39.427
[Rizavi] Oh! Those things
are pretty dangerous, right?

03:39.844 --> 03:41.638
Do I need to explain that the Robeast

03:41.721 --> 03:44.599
was one of the ones used
in Honerva's intergalactic ritual?

03:45.058 --> 03:46.517
-[Rizavi] No, its fine.
-Okay.

03:46.976 --> 03:49.938
Um, so, once the Atlas arrives in orbit
around the planet,

03:50.021 --> 03:52.106
the other Paladins and I
will head down to the surface

03:52.190 --> 03:55.068
to secure the Robeast
and hopefully find its Altean pilot.

03:55.443 --> 03:56.903
[Rizavi] Ugh! Okay.

03:56.986 --> 04:01.241
Keith! Why don't you tell us
about the dangers of this mission?

04:02.367 --> 04:06.412
Well, every mission
has some inherent dangers.

04:06.996 --> 04:10.291
For this one, we have to be
especially diligent about the Robeast.

04:10.375 --> 04:13.586
Even if it's not fully functional,
it can still pose an extreme threat.

04:13.670 --> 04:16.965
Combine that with the hostile Altean
that's probably still in the vicinity,

04:17.048 --> 04:19.884
and you've potentially got threats
on multiple fronts.

04:19.968 --> 04:21.052
Hey, guys. What's up?

04:21.469 --> 04:23.596
You making a movie? Cool.
Can I be in it?

04:23.680 --> 04:26.891
Now, wait, if this is an action movie...
is it? I don't wanna be in it.

04:26.975 --> 04:29.769
[Rizavi] Hunk, we're trying to do
an interview, here.

04:30.770 --> 04:32.563
Oh, sorry.
Yeah, my bad.

04:32.855 --> 04:34.148
Just came to see if you wanted to try

04:34.232 --> 04:36.025
this new recipe
I've been experimenting with.

04:38.027 --> 04:40.530
This is just the first pass.
The final version will be coming soon.

04:40.613 --> 04:42.156
[Bebe whining, growling]

04:42.240 --> 04:43.825
No, Bebe! Not for you!

04:43.908 --> 04:45.785
[panting]

04:46.536 --> 04:49.163
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
I'll make you some doggy treats later.

04:49.247 --> 04:51.708
[Kinkade] What's the recipe?
Can we watch you work?

04:52.041 --> 04:55.336
Well, yeah!
Yeah, this'll be great!

04:55.420 --> 04:57.505
-I've always wanted my own cooking show.
-What? No!

04:57.588 --> 04:59.632
Keith was telling us
about the mission and dangers!

04:59.716 --> 05:01.634
We're not losing that to document cooking.

05:01.718 --> 05:04.137
-[Kinkade] But I like cooking.
-[Rizavi growls]

05:04.220 --> 05:06.264
It's like you're trying
to make this boring.

05:06.723 --> 05:10.018
Whoa, first of all,
cooking is not boring, okay?

05:10.101 --> 05:11.519
And it can bring people together.

05:11.602 --> 05:14.355
Some of the best times were spent
breaking bread with loved ones.

05:14.439 --> 05:17.066
-So, is this interview over?
-No!

05:17.150 --> 05:19.319
Great, now the talent's getting restless!

05:19.402 --> 05:22.363
[Iverson] Everyone, report
to your battle stations immediately!

05:22.447 --> 05:23.281
[alarm blaring]

05:23.364 --> 05:27.076
[Iverson] I repeat...
battle stations immediately!

05:27.160 --> 05:28.453
This is not a drill!

05:28.995 --> 05:31.080
-The camera!
-Leave it! We need to go!

05:31.164 --> 05:32.999
-But this is gold!
-[grunts] Come o--

05:33.082 --> 05:35.710
-[static crackling]
-[booming]

05:35.793 --> 05:38.588
[Iverson] MFE pilots,
report to hangars alpha-bravo!

05:38.671 --> 05:42.050
Scrambling fighters in five!
Paladins, stand by for launch.

05:47.346 --> 05:48.347
[sniffing]

05:53.644 --> 05:55.438
[Bebe panting]

06:00.026 --> 06:02.653
[elevator music playing]

06:05.948 --> 06:08.576
[Shiro] Where did it come from?
Veronica, get me eyes on it!

06:08.659 --> 06:10.328
[Coran] That thing just appeared
out of nowhere!

06:10.411 --> 06:13.706
-[Shiro] Iverson, fire when ready!
-Target acquired! We've got lock!

06:13.790 --> 06:17.126
-[alarm beeping]
-[Iverson] Wait. No... we lost it!

06:17.543 --> 06:18.878
Target has gone dark!

06:20.546 --> 06:22.840
[Veronica] Electromagnetic radiation
from that planet

06:22.924 --> 06:24.634
is overloading our radars.

06:25.259 --> 06:26.928
Voltron, do you have a visual?

06:27.845 --> 06:30.306
I repeat.
Voltron, do you have a visual?

06:31.015 --> 06:32.725
[Keith] Not yet.
We're going in now!

06:32.809 --> 06:33.726
Stand by!

06:36.562 --> 06:39.649
-[grunting] We can't see a thing in here!
-[explosions]

06:39.732 --> 06:42.568
[Griffin] Copy that.
We have zero visibility as well.

06:42.652 --> 06:45.530
-We need a visual.
-[Curtis] Roger. Trying another avenue.

06:45.613 --> 06:47.115
Scanning for biometrics.

06:47.657 --> 06:48.699
Visual acquired!

06:48.908 --> 06:50.576
-[Coran] Incoming!
-[crew shouting]

06:50.660 --> 06:52.203
[Iverson] Recharging starboard cannons!

06:52.286 --> 06:53.913
-[Coran] Sensors are offline!
-[Bebe whines]

06:53.996 --> 06:55.498
-[creature roars]
-[Iverson] What is that?

06:55.581 --> 06:57.875
-[Coran] It's massive!
-[Shiro] Iverson, open fire!

06:57.959 --> 06:59.418
-[blaster booms]
-[creature roars]

06:59.502 --> 07:02.338
-[mice squeaking]
-[Coran] Direct hit!

07:02.421 --> 07:04.465
It's coming back around for another shot!

07:04.549 --> 07:06.008
[Shiro] Veronica, prep shields!

07:16.978 --> 07:19.605
Whatever hit us just knocked loose
the gravity generator!

07:19.689 --> 07:23.025
-Grab the flaxum assembly!
-I can't do that! It's red!

07:23.109 --> 07:26.028
Is this one of your crazy probability,
reality things?

07:28.072 --> 07:30.700
[Shiro] All crew, report to stations
and prepare for Atlas transformation...

07:30.783 --> 07:32.910
-Go, go, go!
-...in T-minus 30 seconds.

07:32.994 --> 07:34.620
-[alarm blaring]
-[grunts]

07:40.334 --> 07:42.086
[Bebe panting]

07:49.385 --> 07:51.095
[Colleen] Bebe,
what are you doing out here?

07:51.179 --> 07:52.889
And what's this in your mouth?

07:54.307 --> 07:56.642
A camera?
Come on, girl!

07:56.934 --> 08:00.480
[Shiro] All crew, prepare for Atlas
transformation sequence in five...

08:00.563 --> 08:04.984
-Oh, no.
-...four, three, two, one.

08:05.485 --> 08:07.904
[camera beeping]

08:10.156 --> 08:13.075
[creature roaring]

08:18.623 --> 08:19.707
[blade rings]

08:20.500 --> 08:21.709
[camera beeping]

08:22.752 --> 08:24.086
[camera beeps, whirs]

08:24.170 --> 08:26.547
Camera's fully charged.
We're good to go.

08:27.423 --> 08:29.550
The time is now 0900 hours.

08:29.842 --> 08:34.847
We just experienced a minor mishap aboard
the IGF Atlas, but we're back on track.

08:35.515 --> 08:39.644
In the future, we'll hopefully be avoiding
creature-occupied gas planets.

08:40.144 --> 08:41.187
[camera beeps, whirs]

08:45.066 --> 08:47.068
Hey, Seok Jin, where you headed?

08:47.485 --> 08:49.529
I'm transporting these samples
back to Earth.

08:49.612 --> 08:52.490
Commander Holt thinks it can help
with the recovery efforts there.

08:52.573 --> 08:55.034
Well, they couldn't have picked
a better man for the job.

08:56.285 --> 08:57.286
Take care, man.

09:02.875 --> 09:03.876
Hey, Seok Jin...

09:07.838 --> 09:08.839
we'll miss you, buddy.

09:15.221 --> 09:18.391
-[camera beeps, whirs]
-[water running]

09:18.683 --> 09:19.517
[water turns off]

09:20.434 --> 09:23.688
There you are! Tell me this thing
was recording during the attack!

09:23.771 --> 09:27.233
That was so intense!
Oh, this documentary's gonna be awesome!

09:27.692 --> 09:28.776
[camera whirs]

09:28.859 --> 09:31.112
I believe our heading readout
en route was...

09:31.821 --> 09:35.866
92254739.275.

09:37.076 --> 09:41.163
Wait, no.
It was 9.265. Yes.

09:41.247 --> 09:44.166
That was our heading per our readout
just prior to our deployment.

09:44.250 --> 09:46.544
-[mock snoring]
-Our teams vary in size.

09:46.919 --> 09:49.839
Often we use the three-person unit,
but it's not unusual

09:49.922 --> 09:53.926
to have a four- or a five-
or perhaps even a six-person unit.

09:54.260 --> 09:57.722
Seven seems rare,
but... it could happen.

09:57.972 --> 10:00.266
Okay, I like everything you're telling me,

10:00.474 --> 10:03.561
but let's just try it a little less
like you're reporting the facts

10:03.644 --> 10:04.979
to your commanding officer

10:05.062 --> 10:08.774
and a little more like you're telling
your friend an exciting story in the gym.

10:08.858 --> 10:09.775
You understand?

10:10.318 --> 10:12.445
-Yes, understood.
-Okay, good.

10:12.778 --> 10:15.031
Why don't you tell us
about your last mission?

10:15.823 --> 10:18.701
Our last mission took place
on planet K-V Exus.

10:19.076 --> 10:21.829
The Blades divided
into three four-person teams

10:21.912 --> 10:25.416
and we escorted approximately
12 rescue crafts to the surface.

10:26.000 --> 10:30.296
I believe our heading readout en route
was 359.222--

10:30.379 --> 10:32.465
Thanks! Thank you!
Okay, I think we got it!

10:32.757 --> 10:34.800
-But I wasn't done.
-Yeah, you nailed it. Yeah.

10:36.260 --> 10:38.346
We need to get someone
more exciting in here.

10:39.263 --> 10:41.724
Then the Atlas started firing
with everything it had!

10:41.807 --> 10:44.769
[imitating gunfire and explosion]

10:44.977 --> 10:46.520
And don't forget the white hole

10:46.604 --> 10:48.981
is swirling right next to us
the entire time!

10:49.065 --> 10:51.150
[imitates whirring]

10:51.233 --> 10:53.152
Oh, no! It's about to close!

10:53.277 --> 10:57.448
Meanwhile, not one, but two,
yes, two, Robeasts are attacking!

10:57.531 --> 11:01.243
Shiro's shouting out orders.
"Coran, get closer!

11:01.619 --> 11:03.204
Iverson, open fire!"

11:03.287 --> 11:04.664
[imitating gunfire]

11:04.997 --> 11:09.001
Beams of Quintessence energy
are converging from all over the galaxy!

11:09.085 --> 11:11.671
[imitating shooting beams]

11:11.754 --> 11:12.671
Ah!

11:12.755 --> 11:14.340
You know, you could just imagine it.

11:14.423 --> 11:15.299
[camera beeps]

11:16.258 --> 11:17.843
Welcome to the engine room.

11:18.010 --> 11:21.806
What you see here is just a tiny part
of what keeps the ship functioning.

11:22.098 --> 11:24.016
[electronic chirping]

11:30.689 --> 11:33.359
[Rizavi] Slav, you've created
some incredible technology.

11:33.442 --> 11:35.027
What do you think of the Atlas?

11:35.111 --> 11:38.864
I can respect any engineering
that extrapolates for transmutation,

11:39.073 --> 11:41.534
but I wish the writing was in Altean.

11:41.617 --> 11:43.661
He's mentioned that a few times.

11:43.869 --> 11:45.287
So, what are you doing now?

11:45.371 --> 11:47.915
Right now we're about to adjust
the gravity generator,

11:47.998 --> 11:50.668
which was fractionally increased
during our last battle.

11:51.127 --> 11:54.505
Yes, our gravity generator
is actually a fluid system,

11:54.588 --> 11:57.925
ever-changing depending
on the specific needs of the location,

11:58.008 --> 12:00.553
so it requires recalibrating
from time to time.

12:01.053 --> 12:04.723
Okay, adjust gravity generator
back down to .12.

12:05.015 --> 12:07.143
-Copy. Adjusting now.
-[beeps]

12:07.226 --> 12:08.727
[all shouting]

12:09.228 --> 12:12.440
-[Sam] What did you press?
-I don't know! Which one is the two again?

12:12.523 --> 12:15.067
I can't read these weird symbols
you call numbers!

12:15.484 --> 12:17.278
Hey, big guy, toss me over!

12:21.991 --> 12:23.242
[all shouting]

12:24.118 --> 12:27.663
-Oh, no! Directly on a crack!
-Weird.

12:28.581 --> 12:30.416
[camera whirs]

12:30.499 --> 12:31.959
[Colleen] Beautiful, isn't it?

12:32.042 --> 12:33.711
It's an Altean juniberry.

12:33.961 --> 12:37.465
The first one to bloom
in nearly 10,000 years.

12:38.215 --> 12:40.301
I managed to get it to grow
by resequencing

12:40.384 --> 12:42.303
the genetic code of similar plant.

12:42.803 --> 12:44.305
I wanna give it to Allura.

12:45.306 --> 12:47.725
-[machines warbling]
-These are our fertilizers.

12:47.808 --> 12:51.187
We have fish emulsion, worm castings,
Kaltenecker manure.

12:51.270 --> 12:53.189
Just so much great recycled poop!

12:53.898 --> 12:55.649
And this is our lighting station.

12:55.733 --> 12:59.737
I like to say our lighting array
is literally out of this world! [chuckles]

12:59.820 --> 13:02.364
You know, because we're, you know,
on a space ship.

13:02.823 --> 13:04.366
Can I take a shot at this?

13:04.950 --> 13:06.202
[video rewinding]

13:06.285 --> 13:07.119
[rock music playing]

13:07.203 --> 13:08.954
[Rizavi] Welcome to
extreme space harvesting!

13:09.163 --> 13:13.209
Where we have plants and crops
and super fertilizers all under one roof!

13:13.292 --> 13:16.754
Meet Colleen Holt,
the botanical genius behind it all.

13:20.925 --> 13:23.135
I guess I just liked plants all my life.

13:23.594 --> 13:26.472
I've done a lot of research,
but I know I have much to learn.

13:26.722 --> 13:30.184
I guess... I like... the challenge.

13:31.894 --> 13:34.063
I'm sorry, where am I
supposed to be looking?

13:34.396 --> 13:37.608
[Rizavi] Without Colleen,
all life aboard the ship could perish.

13:37.691 --> 13:42.696
One bad crop, the introduction
of one foreign pest, and it's all over.

13:43.364 --> 13:45.407
I just like plants.

13:45.658 --> 13:48.494
Oh, sorry.
Am I interrupting something again?

13:48.577 --> 13:52.581
I just-- I just came in to see if Colleen
had a very specific type of yeast.

13:52.665 --> 13:55.251
-[Kinkade] Yeast? What for?
-[Rizavi] Oh, no.

13:55.334 --> 13:56.710
It's that recipe I've been working on.

13:56.794 --> 13:57.920
I think I got the topping down,

13:58.003 --> 14:00.297
but I'm still trying to figure out
the sweet bread.

14:00.464 --> 14:03.217
[Colleen] I have so many strains of yeast,
it'll make your head spin.

14:03.300 --> 14:08.055
I got AB972, S288C.
I even have O unilateralis.

14:08.138 --> 14:09.348
Don't mess with that one.

14:09.431 --> 14:12.226
-Are you getting this?
-[Rizavi] Unfortunately, yes.

14:12.810 --> 14:14.019
[camera beeps, whirs]

14:14.103 --> 14:16.480
The time is 1200 hours.

14:16.564 --> 14:19.859
We just got word
that we are in the Grei-Aye star system.

14:19.942 --> 14:22.528
The Paladins will be heading down
to the surface of the planet

14:22.611 --> 14:24.280
any second now.

14:25.072 --> 14:28.117
Lance, how are you feeling
about the mission you're about to go on?

14:28.200 --> 14:30.661
Oh, hey.
I'm feeling good, I guess.

14:30.744 --> 14:32.037
Maybe a little tense.

14:32.121 --> 14:33.330
Maybe a lot tense.

14:33.706 --> 14:36.166
I don't know.
Why'd you have to ask me that question?

14:36.542 --> 14:40.170
I think what Lance
is trying to say is he'll be fine.

14:40.254 --> 14:41.338
We all will.

14:42.381 --> 14:43.215
Let's move out.

14:44.133 --> 14:44.967
[camera beeps]

14:47.386 --> 14:49.388
Right now, we're headed
to the situation room

14:49.471 --> 14:52.474
where we'll be monitoring
the Paladins in real-time.

14:52.766 --> 14:55.561
By the way, you know we're not
gonna be able to bring our camera

14:55.644 --> 14:56.896
into that meeting, right?

14:58.188 --> 14:59.231
[sotto voce] Says who?

15:03.485 --> 15:05.446
[Sam] Come in, Pidge.
Are you reading us?

15:05.905 --> 15:08.449
[Pidge] Okay, we've just touched down
on the surface.

15:08.532 --> 15:10.159
[Keith] We're at the crash site now.

15:12.870 --> 15:14.121
[Pidge] That's the Robeast.

15:14.204 --> 15:17.041
It looks disabled,
just like our intel reported.

15:17.458 --> 15:18.918
The Altean should be nearby.

15:19.376 --> 15:20.210
[ship whirs]

15:20.294 --> 15:21.962
Paladins, brace for incoming!

15:25.257 --> 15:28.260
-I didn't know it could do that!
-[Keith] Take cover!

15:28.886 --> 15:29.970
[Lance screams]

15:30.596 --> 15:32.556
Paladins, report!
We've lost visual.

15:33.098 --> 15:36.226
-Bridge, lock on to that ship now!
-[Curtis] Yes, Captain.

15:36.310 --> 15:38.437
Adjusting to long-range parameters.

15:40.522 --> 15:42.608
-[beeping]
-[Curtis] Locked on!

15:43.108 --> 15:44.026
Light it up!

15:45.945 --> 15:47.821
-[laser blasts]
-[Curtis] Direct hit!

15:48.781 --> 15:51.408
-Nice shot, Atlas!
-Yeah, thanks for the cover!

15:52.368 --> 15:53.911
Bridge, stay on alert.

15:54.620 --> 15:56.622
[Pidge panting]

16:00.876 --> 16:03.253
[Allura] Stand by, Atlas.
We're approaching the ship.

16:03.921 --> 16:06.882
Guys, there doesn't seem to be
a pilot inside.

16:08.133 --> 16:09.760
[Keith] Hey, guys, over here.

16:11.595 --> 16:13.430
[Pidge] Keith's found something.
Let's go!

16:13.514 --> 16:15.766
[panting]

16:17.810 --> 16:19.061
[Pidge] Give me a second.

16:19.353 --> 16:22.773
Just reconfiguring
to this barrier's isometric frequency.

16:23.148 --> 16:24.900
-[beeps]
-There! That should do it.

16:24.984 --> 16:27.319
[beeping, chiming]

16:30.155 --> 16:32.574
Atlas, our target is acquired.

16:32.658 --> 16:34.660
[overlapping voices]
Yippee! All right! Yeah!

16:34.743 --> 16:36.120
[Shiro] Great job, everyone!

16:37.037 --> 16:40.249
We just got word that the Paladins
have returned from their mission.

16:40.332 --> 16:42.751
Maybe we can catch a glimpse
of this new Altean.

16:44.545 --> 16:47.631
[indistinct radio chatter]

16:48.716 --> 16:50.968
This will be the sixth Altean pilot
we've recovered

16:51.051 --> 16:54.847
from the powered-down Robeasts
left behind after Honerva escaped Oriande.

16:55.139 --> 16:57.433
Allura keeps trying,
but she hasn't been able to get

16:57.516 --> 16:59.226
any information from them as of yet.

17:00.227 --> 17:01.228
[camera whirring]

17:09.903 --> 17:12.573
[Rizavi] Commander Shirogane said
you two were needed on the bridge.

17:12.656 --> 17:15.242
-We'll cover your station.
-[woman] Yes, Lieutenant.

17:20.873 --> 17:21.749
[watch beeps]

17:27.254 --> 17:28.130
[gasps] There!

17:28.881 --> 17:30.883
Oh, man,
I think we missed the beginning!

17:31.508 --> 17:32.843
[Romelle] Tavo, please.

17:33.093 --> 17:35.512
You and I grew up alongside one another.

17:35.804 --> 17:38.390
You must trust me.
We're here to help.

17:38.891 --> 17:43.395
We were told you are a traitor,
and I can see now that it is true.

17:44.396 --> 17:47.357
I'm done talking with him.
I'm done with all of them.

17:52.029 --> 17:52.863
[gasps]

17:54.615 --> 17:57.826
-[Kinkade] Uh, what are you doing?
-[Rizavi] Shh! I got an idea.

18:00.204 --> 18:01.205
[Lance] Anything?

18:01.997 --> 18:04.792
[Allura] No. He was just like the others.

18:04.875 --> 18:06.710
A true believer in Honerva,

18:06.794 --> 18:09.963
and there's nothing I can say
that would make him think otherwise.

18:10.339 --> 18:11.423
I'm sorry.

18:12.049 --> 18:13.675
No, I am.

18:14.676 --> 18:17.971
These Alteans are the key
to unlocking Honerva's plan.

18:18.388 --> 18:21.058
They're my people,
but they won't speak with me.

18:21.475 --> 18:24.812
You have no idea what it's like
to find out after 10,000 years

18:24.895 --> 18:26.814
that you're not the last of your kind...

18:27.481 --> 18:29.316
only to be rejected by them.

18:29.399 --> 18:30.317
I don't.

18:30.943 --> 18:34.238
But I wish every day there were something
I could do to change it all for you.

18:34.613 --> 18:37.825
You've suffered more than anyone should
in a thousand lifetimes.

18:37.908 --> 18:39.409
But still you persist.

18:39.701 --> 18:41.411
Through the pain, you inspire.

18:42.329 --> 18:44.456
It's one of the reasons
I fell in love with you.

18:52.506 --> 18:56.510
-[Kinkade] No, that's private.
-[Rizavi] Kinkade, what are you doing?

18:56.844 --> 18:58.303
That was our love angle!

18:59.054 --> 19:00.180
[camera whirs]

19:00.264 --> 19:03.142
-[Kinkade] Please don't touch that.
-Oh, sorry.

19:05.060 --> 19:06.854
[Rizavi] So, Romelle,
you know these Alteans

19:06.937 --> 19:08.438
from your time on the colony?

19:08.522 --> 19:11.275
Yes. I lived alongside them
for many deca-phoebs.

19:11.358 --> 19:12.734
They are good people.

19:12.818 --> 19:15.529
[Kinkade] What do you think
would make them join forces with Honerva?

19:16.196 --> 19:17.447
I don't know.

19:17.531 --> 19:21.160
But you must understand, my people
were hunted nearly to extinction.

19:21.451 --> 19:22.578
They're afraid.

19:23.078 --> 19:27.124
And this Honerva...
she's turned that fear to aggression.

19:27.833 --> 19:30.460
If there was just some way
to get through to them.

19:31.587 --> 19:33.005
[chatter]

19:33.088 --> 19:34.840
I've never seen anything like it.

19:34.923 --> 19:37.718
All those tentacles... so nasty.

19:40.429 --> 19:42.723
-[camera whirs]
-Oh, hey. You're just in time.

19:42.806 --> 19:45.601
I was just about to add the yeast
Colleen gave me.

19:45.684 --> 19:48.478
-[barks]
-No, Bebe! Bad dog!

19:48.937 --> 19:50.314
[camera whirs]

19:52.983 --> 19:53.817
[watch beeps]

19:57.487 --> 20:00.073
[Kinkade] First off,
thanks for doing this, Allura.

20:00.157 --> 20:01.116
You're welcome.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.994
[Rizavi] Maybe we can start
with the Alteans we have aboard.

20:04.369 --> 20:05.537
What about them?

20:05.621 --> 20:08.957
They're on the wrong side of this war
and they refuse to speak with me.

20:09.124 --> 20:10.459
There's nothing else to say.

20:10.918 --> 20:14.421
-[Rizavi] So, you're frustrated?
-Yes, I am.

20:14.755 --> 20:17.174
Oriande was destroyed, Lotor is back,

20:17.257 --> 20:19.593
and we aren't any closer
to tracking down Honerva.

20:20.219 --> 20:23.388
She's out there, right now,
planning something,

20:23.472 --> 20:25.891
preparing, and growing stronger.

20:25.974 --> 20:28.268
And we're here flying around in circles,

20:28.352 --> 20:30.646
searching for Fraunhofer lines
that don't appear

20:30.729 --> 20:33.440
and scanning for wormhole signatures
that don't exist!

20:34.233 --> 20:36.526
[Rizavi] Do you think
we'll ever find Honerva?

20:36.860 --> 20:40.280
No. I think she'll find us.

20:41.240 --> 20:42.157
[camera whirs]

20:42.241 --> 20:45.953
Okay, it's been a long day,
but I'm finally done.

20:48.372 --> 20:51.583
-[Kinkade] What is it?
-[Hunk] It's an authentic Altean dessert!

20:51.667 --> 20:53.335
I'm gonna give it to the Alteans.

20:53.418 --> 20:56.713
Coran helped me with the recipe,
but I think his memory was a bit fuzzy,

20:56.797 --> 20:58.632
so, you know, I did some improvising.

20:58.715 --> 20:59.549
No big whoop.

20:59.633 --> 21:01.635
You did this for them? Why?

21:02.636 --> 21:03.679
Well, I don't know.

21:03.971 --> 21:07.849
Because food has a way of reminding people
of moments in time.

21:08.433 --> 21:09.601
That's why I made a dessert.

21:09.685 --> 21:12.396
Usually, when you eat dessert,
you're pretty happy, right?

21:12.646 --> 21:13.563
Who knows?

21:13.897 --> 21:17.150
Maybe this'll help those Alteans remember
some moment that made them smile.

21:17.317 --> 21:19.111
Something before all this madness.

21:19.569 --> 21:21.822
That could go a long way
in building a relationship.

21:22.155 --> 21:23.573
Well, that's just what I think.

21:24.741 --> 21:26.243
[camera whirs]

21:28.203 --> 21:29.871
Please, eat.

21:30.539 --> 21:32.749
Look, it's good!

21:33.625 --> 21:34.835
Mm, really!

21:43.260 --> 21:46.638
You made this?
It reminds me of home.

21:47.097 --> 21:50.600
Well, I had a little help
from someone born and raised on Altea.

21:50.684 --> 21:51.685
[Alteans gasp]

21:53.729 --> 21:55.856
[stammers] And I know
you don't wanna talk with them,

21:55.939 --> 21:59.776
but Allura and Coran know more
about your homeland than anyone alive.

22:00.569 --> 22:02.612
They were on Altea until its final day.

22:02.988 --> 22:06.366
They would've stayed and died to
protect it if Alfor hadn't sent them away.

22:06.450 --> 22:07.909
That's how much they loved it.

22:09.369 --> 22:12.581
I heard Altea was
one of the most beautiful places

22:12.664 --> 22:13.707
in the universe.

22:16.376 --> 22:18.086
Did your Alteans ever tell you

22:18.170 --> 22:20.922
about the Zyo-Crystal Springs
outside of the capital?

22:21.673 --> 22:24.176
The stories say those cliffs
were more beautiful

22:24.259 --> 22:26.219
than all of the stars combined.

22:27.596 --> 22:29.014
They never told me about them.

22:29.514 --> 22:31.892
But I'm sure they'd love
to tell you themselves.

22:39.441 --> 22:42.569
This is Lieutenant Ryan Kinkade,
MFE pilot.

22:43.278 --> 22:45.238
The time is 2300 hours.

22:45.822 --> 22:49.618
Day 47 aboard the IGF Atlas
is officially done.

22:51.369 --> 22:53.789
[theme music playing]
