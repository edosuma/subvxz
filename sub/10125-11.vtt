WEBVTT

00:10.100 --> 00:12.700
YOU KNOW THE BEST
THING ABOUT STUDYING
AT YOUR HOUSE?

00:12.700 --> 00:14.200
GOOD BATHROOM LIGHTING?

00:14.200 --> 00:15.200
NO FEENY.

00:15.200 --> 00:16.500
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

00:16.500 --> 00:17.600
MORNING.

00:17.600 --> 00:21.467
THAT IS REALLY
NOT FAIR.

00:22.600 --> 00:25.000
YOU'RE CLOSEST.
LET HIM IN.

00:25.000 --> 00:26.600
WHY? SO HE CAN
HASSLE ME?

00:26.600 --> 00:29.734
NO. THAT DOOR'S
DOING EXACTLY WHAT
IT'S SUPPOSED TO.

00:29.734 --> 00:32.600
HEY, I KNOW FEENY.
THE MAN IS A PRO.

00:32.600 --> 00:36.467
NOW HE LEAVES THAT
PRINCIPAL STUFF AT SCHOOL.

00:36.467 --> 00:39.233
READY FOR THE TEST,
GENTLEMEN?

00:39.233 --> 00:40.233
AGAIN,

00:40.233 --> 00:41.233
NOT FAIR.

00:41.233 --> 00:42.567
WE'RE STUDYING,
MR. FEENY.

00:42.567 --> 00:44.834
SEE? MY HISTORY BOOK
IS RIGHT HERE.

00:44.834 --> 00:48.200
STILL IN ITS ORIGINAL
CELLOPHANE, I SEE.

00:48.200 --> 00:49.900
I GET TOP DOLLAR
ON RESALE.

00:49.900 --> 00:53.867
YOU KNOW, MR. HUNTER,
I'VE NOTICED THAT
MY BEST STUDENTS

00:53.867 --> 00:55.934
HAVE USUALLY READ
THE BOOK.

00:55.934 --> 00:57.600
YEAH, WHAT'S THAT
GET THEM?

00:57.600 --> 00:59.100
INTO COLLEGE.

00:59.100 --> 01:00.467
MORE BOOKS.

01:00.467 --> 01:04.133
GEORGE. ARE THE BOYS
IN TROUBLE?

01:04.133 --> 01:06.233
PROBABLY...

01:06.233 --> 01:07.767
BUT THAT'S NOT
WHY I'M HERE.

01:07.767 --> 01:10.700
YOU REMEMBERED
IT'S MY BIRTHDAY
THIS SUNDAY.

01:10.700 --> 01:13.734
THAT IS SO SWEET.

01:13.734 --> 01:15.300
OH, MORNING, GEORGE.

01:15.300 --> 01:16.734
ARE THE BOYS IN TROUBLE?

01:16.734 --> 01:19.400
GEORGE REMEMBERED
IT'S MY BIRTHDAY.

01:19.400 --> 01:20.700
YOUR BIRTHDAY'S COMING UP?

01:20.700 --> 01:22.200
I'M KIDDING.

01:22.200 --> 01:25.700
IT'S SUNDAY.
I WOULDN'T FORGET.
THE EAGLES ARE PLAYING.

01:25.700 --> 01:27.567
NOT FOR YOU, HONEY.

01:27.567 --> 01:28.600
A KEY?

01:28.600 --> 01:30.100
TO MY COTTAGE
IN THE MOUNTAINS.

01:30.100 --> 01:33.400
I THOUGHT YOU TWO
MIGHT ENJOY A ROMANTIC
GETAWAY THIS WEEKEND.

01:33.400 --> 01:36.600
OH, GEORGE,
YOU ARE THE BEST.

01:36.600 --> 01:38.367
THANK YOU.

01:38.367 --> 01:40.000
WAIT A MINUTE.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.033
I THOUGHT
YOU SOLD THAT PLACE.

01:42.033 --> 01:43.033
I INTEND TO.

01:43.033 --> 01:44.567
I DON'T
GET UP THERE MUCH,

01:44.567 --> 01:46.100
BUT IT'S VERY ROMANTIC.

01:46.100 --> 01:49.200
THAT'S VERY CONSIDERATE,
GEORGE, BUT I'VE ALREADY
MADE PLANS.

01:49.200 --> 01:52.100
WELL, HANG ONTO THE KEY.
ANOTHER WEEKEND, PERHAPS.

01:52.100 --> 01:56.300
WHOOPS! MY HISTORY
BOOK JUST SLIPPED.

01:56.300 --> 01:57.500
I'D BETTER FIND IT.

01:57.500 --> 01:59.200
CORY, YOU KNOW
THE TERRAIN BEST?

01:59.200 --> 02:04.500
OH, YES. I KNOW THIS TUNDRA
LIKE MY OWN BACKYARD.

02:08.033 --> 02:10.800
I'VE GOT SOMETHING
INCREDIBLE TO TELL YOU,

02:10.800 --> 02:12.200
BUT FOR SECURITY REASONS,

02:12.200 --> 02:14.667
I AM GOING TO USE
OUR CODE.

02:14.667 --> 02:17.300
WELL, WE DON'T
HAVE A CODE, SO...

02:17.300 --> 02:18.300
REALLY?

02:18.300 --> 02:20.100
GUYS LIKE US
SHOULD HAVE A CODE.

02:20.100 --> 02:22.967
WE'LL DISCUSS THAT
AT THE NEXT MEETING...

02:22.967 --> 02:24.834
WHEN'S
OUR NEXT MEETING?

02:24.834 --> 02:27.300
SHAWN,
WE DON'T HAVE MEETINGS.

02:27.300 --> 02:28.734
THIS CLUB BLOWS.

02:28.734 --> 02:32.734
I THINK I KNOW HOW
TO MAKE IT BETTER.

02:35.100 --> 02:36.900
IT'S FEENY'S KEY.
SO WHAT?

02:36.900 --> 02:39.400
SO THERE'S AN EMPTY COTTAGE
IN SKI COUNTRY,

02:39.400 --> 02:45.467
WHICH MEANS A MOUNTAIN
FULL OF YOUNG, HEALTHY,
SNUGGLY SNOW BUNNIES.

02:46.600 --> 02:47.600
FEENY'S HOUSE?

02:47.600 --> 02:49.667
IF WE WENT THERE,
HE'D GO MENTAL.

02:49.667 --> 02:50.800
A BONUS.

02:50.800 --> 02:55.367
HE GOES OUT OF HIS WAY
TO MAKE MY LIFE MISERABLE.

02:55.367 --> 02:56.600
THIS MAKES IT UP.

02:56.600 --> 02:57.700
SHAWN,
IT'S NOT RIGHT.

02:57.700 --> 03:00.133
COR, SOMETIMES
YOU GOT TO BREAK THE RULES.

03:00.133 --> 03:02.500
LOOK, IT'S DECEITFUL
AND IRRESPONSIBLE.

03:02.500 --> 03:08.467
PLUS THE CHANCES OF
GETTING AWAY WITH IT
ARE SLIM TO NONE.

03:08.467 --> 03:11.767
OH,
YOU KNOW I'M GOING.

03:15.467 --> 03:17.400
TWO BUS TICKETS
TO PARADISE.

03:17.400 --> 03:18.400
THE WEATHER REPORT?

03:18.400 --> 03:20.867
FRESH BLANKET OF SNOW
IN THE MOUNTAINS.

03:20.867 --> 03:23.200
SHAWN, NOT TO PUT A DAMPER
ON OUR PLANS,

03:23.200 --> 03:26.300
BUT I RECALLED
IN A MOMENT OF CLARITY--

03:26.300 --> 03:27.667
WE DON'T SKI!

03:27.667 --> 03:31.500
HEY, WE DON'T LEARN,
BUT WE GO TO SCHOOL,
DON'T WE?

03:31.500 --> 03:33.000
UH, MR. TURNER?

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
MR. TURNER?

03:34.000 --> 03:35.133
YEAH, WHAT IS IT?

03:35.133 --> 03:36.800
IT'S ME...ERIC.
I'M CORY'S BROTHER.

03:36.800 --> 03:39.500
YEAH. YOU'RE IN MY
ENGLISH LIT CLASS.

03:39.500 --> 03:41.500
HOW AM I DOING?
NOT SO GREAT.

03:41.500 --> 03:46.667
COOL. UH, ANYWAY...
I SAW YOU TALKING
TO BIANCA SABATINI?

03:46.667 --> 03:47.900
[GIGGLING]

03:47.900 --> 03:48.967
UH-HUH.

03:48.967 --> 03:50.300
YEAH.

03:50.300 --> 03:51.934
HOW DO YOU KNOW HER?

03:51.934 --> 03:53.133
I'M HER TEACHER.

03:53.133 --> 03:56.467
COULD YOU TEACH HER
TO GO OUT WITH ME?

03:56.467 --> 03:58.600
SHE ONLY
GOES OUT WITH JOCKS.

03:58.600 --> 03:59.867
I'M NOT REALLY
INTO SPORTS.

03:59.867 --> 04:02.867
I WATCH GAMES
JUST TO SEE
THE PLAYERS' WIVES.

04:02.867 --> 04:05.100
THEY GET
THE BEST-LOOKING
GIRLS. THEY--

04:05.100 --> 04:07.867
THIS CONVERSATION DOESN'T
REALLY NEED ME, DOES IT?

04:07.867 --> 04:11.500
NO, BUT THANKS
FOR YOUR TIME.
SEE YOU.

04:11.500 --> 04:12.900
UM, HI, BIANCA?

04:12.900 --> 04:16.467
ERIC MATTHEWS. WE'RE
IN THE SAME ENGLISH CLASS.

04:16.467 --> 04:19.300
OH, YEAH. YOU'RE
THE SMART ONE.

04:19.300 --> 04:23.767
THAT'S RIGHT. THIS YEAR
I MIGHT BE CLASS VICTORIAN.

04:23.767 --> 04:27.600
YOU'RE CUTE.
ARE YOU A JOCK?

04:27.600 --> 04:29.734
I'VE WORN THEM.

04:30.800 --> 04:33.500
WHAT IS IT WITH YOU
AND JOCKS?

04:33.500 --> 04:34.967
I LIKE TO DATE
WINNERS.

04:34.967 --> 04:37.400
SO WHAT SPORT
DO YOU PLAY?

04:39.033 --> 04:40.834
DO YOU FOLLOW POOL?

04:40.834 --> 04:41.900
NOT AT ALL.

04:41.900 --> 04:45.567
I'M A GRAND MASTER.

04:45.567 --> 04:46.667
YOU KNOW,
THAT'S FUNNY.

04:46.667 --> 04:48.133
I NEVER
THOUGHT OF POOL

04:48.133 --> 04:50.367
AS A JOCK-Y
KIND OF SPORT.

04:50.367 --> 04:51.367
REALLY?

04:51.367 --> 04:52.500
SEE THIS SCAR?

04:52.500 --> 04:56.500
EIGHT-BALL
CHAMPIONSHIPS,
MEXICO CITY, 1964.

04:57.867 --> 05:00.800
EXCUSE ME, IF IT ISN'T
MR. AND MRS. BUTTINSKY

05:00.800 --> 05:03.367
ON THE TABLE
THAT ME AND FRANKIE

05:03.367 --> 05:04.800
WERE MOST JOYOUSLY
PLAYING UPON.

05:04.800 --> 05:07.800
THE TABLE WAS EMPTY,
SO IF YOU DON'T MIND,

05:07.800 --> 05:08.934
WE'LL JUST FINISH.

05:08.934 --> 05:12.200
WHAT, ARE YOU CHALLENGING
FRANKIE TO THE TABLE?

05:12.200 --> 05:13.200
I SAID THAT?

05:13.200 --> 05:14.900
WELL,
YOU IMPLIED IT.

05:14.900 --> 05:16.000
COME ON, ERIC.

05:16.000 --> 05:19.400
I'D LOVE TO SEE
THE GRAND MASTER
AT WORK.

05:19.400 --> 05:21.800
IT'D MAKE ME
VERY HAPPY.

05:23.967 --> 05:26.233
O.K., FRANKIE, YOU'RE ON.

05:26.233 --> 05:27.233
HEE HEE HEE.

05:27.233 --> 05:29.200
HOW GOOD COULD HE BE,
RIGHT?

05:29.200 --> 05:30.367
[GIGGLING]

05:30.367 --> 05:34.200
YOU'RE BURIED, MATTHEWS,
DEAD, IN THE GROUND.

05:38.567 --> 05:40.867
WELL, HERE YOU GO.

05:40.867 --> 05:41.867
HANK HOO.

05:41.867 --> 05:43.600
HANK HOO HERY HUCH.

05:43.600 --> 05:46.400
LITTLE CHILLY
FOR YOU CITY BOYS.

05:46.400 --> 05:47.500
HITTLE VIT.

05:47.500 --> 05:51.300
THANKS FOR THE RIDE,
OFFICER...UH...

05:51.300 --> 05:54.467
RANGER. RANGER MARK.

05:54.467 --> 05:57.233
HOW OLD ARE YOU?

05:57.233 --> 06:00.066
WHICH ONE OF YOU
IS FEENY'S GRANDSON?

06:00.066 --> 06:01.300
HE IS.
OH, HE IS.

06:01.300 --> 06:02.300
WELL, I AM.

06:02.300 --> 06:03.667
WE--WE BOTH ARE.

06:03.667 --> 06:05.233
WE'RE BROTHERS.
WE'RE COUSINS.

06:05.233 --> 06:06.467
BROTHER-COUSINS.

06:06.467 --> 06:08.133
NO NEED TO EXPLAIN, SON.

06:08.133 --> 06:12.000
I'M FROM MOUNTAIN PEOPLE
MYSELF.

06:12.000 --> 06:15.900
SO, RANGER MARK,
HOW FAR'S
THE NEAREST SKI LODGE?

06:15.900 --> 06:17.200
OH, ABOUT 2 MILES.

06:17.200 --> 06:21.100
MANAGEABLE...
AND HOW FAR
IF YOU'RE WALKING?

06:21.100 --> 06:23.100
2 MILES.

06:23.100 --> 06:24.767
2 MILES?

06:24.767 --> 06:28.100
HEY, LIGHTEN UP,
COR, IT'S ONLY
A MILE EACH.

06:28.100 --> 06:32.200
YOU BOYS BE SURE TO
SECURE YOUR WINDOWS
AND DOORS AT NIGHT.

06:32.200 --> 06:34.567
YOU WOULDN'T WANT
TO WAKE UP IN THE MORNING

06:34.567 --> 06:38.200
WITH A SKULLFUL
OF GRADY'S AX.

06:38.200 --> 06:40.800
GRADY'S AX?

06:40.800 --> 06:42.200
HA HA.

06:42.200 --> 06:47.200
LEGEND HAS IT THAT
YEARS AGO A MAN BROUGHT
HIS BEAUTIFUL BRIDE

06:47.200 --> 06:48.300
TO GRADY PINES,

06:48.300 --> 06:52.133
AND SHE FELL IN LOVE
WITH A YOUNG SKI INSTRUCTOR.

06:52.133 --> 06:53.900
THE HUSBAND WENT CRAZY
WITH JEALOUSY

06:53.900 --> 06:59.900
AND HACKED THEM BOTH UP
BEFORE TAKING HIS OWN LIFE.

06:59.900 --> 07:03.000
NOW THE LOCALS WILL
TELL YOU EVERY YEAR

07:03.000 --> 07:05.500
THAT PSYCHO RETURNS
TO THIS MOUNTAIN

07:05.500 --> 07:10.500
TO WREAK
HIS BLOODY REVENGE.

07:14.100 --> 07:16.300
UH, I--I GOT
A QUESTION.

07:16.300 --> 07:18.567
IF THE PSYCHO
TOOK HIS OWN LIFE,

07:18.567 --> 07:21.967
THEN HOW CAN HE
COME BACK?

07:21.967 --> 07:24.867
HUH.

07:26.967 --> 07:31.767
THAT'S WHY YOU DON'T
SEE MANY RANGERS ON
<i>THE TONIGHT SHOW. </i>

07:31.767 --> 07:35.734
ANYWAY, YOU BOYS KNOW HOW
TO TURN ON THE ELECTRICITY?

07:35.734 --> 07:36.734
OH, PLEASE.

07:36.734 --> 07:39.100
I THINK WE CAN
FLIP A SWITCH.

07:39.100 --> 07:40.200
GOOD. I GOT TO GO.

07:40.200 --> 07:43.033
I'M WATCHING
A VIDEO WITH
MY BUDDY MOOSE.

07:43.033 --> 07:46.367
OH. ANOTHER RANGER
FRIEND OF YOURS?

07:46.367 --> 07:50.000
A MOOSE CAN'T BE
A RANGER.

07:51.200 --> 07:54.567
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT?
"TURN ON THE ELECTRICITY."

07:54.567 --> 07:55.834
I KNOW.

07:55.834 --> 07:59.367
WHAT KIND OF
CITY MAMA'S BOYS
DOES HE TAKE US FOR?

07:59.367 --> 08:01.000
THIS IS VE--

08:14.834 --> 08:15.867
ERIC, WHAT...

08:15.867 --> 08:17.100
AHEM.

08:17.100 --> 08:20.500
IN MEXICO THEY
HAVE CHICKEN WIRE
AROUND THE TABLE.

08:20.500 --> 08:21.900
WHAT'S THE CROWD FOR?

08:21.900 --> 08:23.834
BIG GAME, MR. WILLIAMS.

08:23.834 --> 08:25.400
COME ON, CONCENTRATE,
FRANKIE.

08:25.400 --> 08:27.300
LIKE YOU DO
AT THANKSGIVING.

08:27.300 --> 08:29.300
FIRST NIGHT
OR SECOND NIGHT?

08:29.300 --> 08:30.867
THERE'S ONLY ONE NIGHT.

08:30.867 --> 08:32.867
NOT AT MY HOUSE.

08:34.567 --> 08:35.734
YES!

08:35.734 --> 08:36.734
NO !

08:36.734 --> 08:39.000
AH HA HA HA!

08:40.033 --> 08:41.100
MATTHEWS.

08:41.100 --> 08:42.600
HOW LONG YOU GUYS
BEEN PLAYING?

08:42.600 --> 08:43.734
ABOUT AN HOUR.

08:43.734 --> 08:46.834
WHY ARE ALL
THE BALLS STILL
ON THE TABLE?

08:46.834 --> 08:49.467
I'M HAVING SOME BAD LUCK.

08:51.133 --> 08:53.033
SOME
SERIOUS BAD LUCK.

08:53.033 --> 08:55.100
HUH.

08:55.100 --> 08:58.934
WELL, THAT WAS THE WORST
TWO HOURS OF MY LIFE.

08:58.934 --> 09:01.934
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THE SKI LODGE WAS CLOSED.

09:01.934 --> 09:04.400
YOU'D THINK
RANGER MARK
MIGHT'VE MENTIONED

09:04.400 --> 09:07.300
THAT THERE'S
NO ONE ELSE
ON THE MOUNTAIN!

09:07.300 --> 09:09.233
THERE WASN'T EVEN
ANY SNOW.

09:09.233 --> 09:10.767
YEAH, WHAT ABOUT
THAT, SHAWN?

09:10.767 --> 09:15.200
YOU SAID THE WEATHER
REPORT SAID SNOW
IN THE MOUNTAINS.

09:15.200 --> 09:16.700
THEY DID.

09:16.700 --> 09:20.100
THEY SAID THE ROCKY
MOUNTAINS WERE BLANKETED
WITH FRESH POWDER.

09:21.133 --> 09:22.567
THE ROCKIES?

09:22.567 --> 09:24.934
SHAWN, WE'RE
IN THE POCONOS!

09:24.934 --> 09:28.133
2,000 MILES AWAY FROM
THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS.

09:28.133 --> 09:29.967
OH, YOU MEAN
THAT'S A NAME?

09:29.967 --> 09:32.100
I THOUGHT
IT WAS A DESCRIPTION.

09:32.100 --> 09:35.300
YOU KNOW,
LIKE "CHEWY NOUGAT."

09:35.300 --> 09:36.500
THAT'S GREAT, SHAWN.

09:36.500 --> 09:38.867
NO POWER, NO LIGHTS,
NO HEAT.

09:38.867 --> 09:40.300
WHAT NOW?

09:40.300 --> 09:43.400
O.K., O.K.,
LET ME THINK,
LET ME THINK.

09:43.400 --> 09:46.233
CORY, EITHER THE
LIGHTS JUST WENT ON,

09:46.233 --> 09:49.500
OR I GOT AN IDEA.

09:50.600 --> 09:52.400
SOMEBODY'S HERE. SHH.

09:52.400 --> 09:53.867
WHO?

09:53.867 --> 09:56.300
A DEAD PSYCHO AX MURDERER.

09:56.300 --> 09:57.300
YOU MEAN GRADY?

09:57.300 --> 09:59.200
NO, I'M THINKING
POOH BEAR.

09:59.200 --> 10:00.934
OF COURSE, GRADY!

10:05.500 --> 10:08.400
O.K., YOU DEAD
PSYCHO AX MURDERER!

10:08.400 --> 10:11.800
LET'S SEE
WHAT YOU'RE MADE OF!

10:22.400 --> 10:23.867
ALL RIGHT, I'M HERE.

10:23.867 --> 10:27.600
TIME TO BELLY UP
TO THE EXCUSE TABLE.

10:27.600 --> 10:33.100
MR. FEENY, YOU'VE GOT
NO RIGHT TRESPASSING
ON YOUR OWN PROPERTY.

10:33.100 --> 10:35.033
MR. MATTHEWS,
YOU'RE UP.

10:35.033 --> 10:38.834
ACTUALLY, MR. FEENY,
MY PARENTS ARE
ON THEIR WAY UP,

10:38.834 --> 10:40.567
AND WE RUSHED AHEAD
TO STRAIGHTEN UP.

10:40.567 --> 10:42.867
THAT'S A
BALD-FACED LIE.

10:42.867 --> 10:45.400
EVERY WORD, SIR.

10:45.400 --> 10:47.100
SO, YOU TWO
SNAKED THE KEY

10:47.100 --> 10:50.934
AND SNUCK UP HERE
TO HAVE A GOOD TIME,
HMM?

10:50.934 --> 10:54.033
THAT'S A BALD-FACED LIE,
MR. FEENY!

10:55.200 --> 10:57.667
IT WORKED WHEN <i>HE </i>SAID IT.

10:57.667 --> 11:00.200
MR. FEENY,
I THOUGHT YOU SAID

11:00.200 --> 11:01.834
YOU NEVER USED
THIS PLACE ANYMORE.

11:01.834 --> 11:04.133
I CAME TO PACK UP
SO I COULD SELL IT.

11:04.133 --> 11:05.133
WE'LL TAKE IT.

11:05.133 --> 11:07.700
NOW YOU'RE TRESPASSING!

11:07.700 --> 11:10.400
I DON'T EVEN
HEAR YOU ANYMORE.

11:10.400 --> 11:11.400
LOOK, MR. FEENY,

11:11.400 --> 11:12.734
BEFORE THINGS GET
TOO OUT OF HAND,

11:12.734 --> 11:14.300
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
CALL OUR PARENTS,

11:14.300 --> 11:15.800
AND THEY CAN
PICK US UP?

11:15.800 --> 11:16.900
THIS LATE? UH-UH.

11:16.900 --> 11:19.600
WE'RE STUCK HERE
TILL MORNING.

11:19.600 --> 11:21.233
LIKE IT OR NOT.

11:21.233 --> 11:23.500
HOW MANY BEDS
ARE THERE?

11:23.500 --> 11:24.567
ONE.

11:24.567 --> 11:26.967
I'LL FLIP YOU
FOR IT.

11:26.967 --> 11:28.600
CALL IT IN THE AIR.

11:31.300 --> 11:32.800
YOU LOSE.

11:41.233 --> 11:42.500
WHY'S EVERYBODY
CHEERING?

11:42.500 --> 11:45.934
NOBODY'S SEEN
FOLKS HOLD A TABLE
FOR THREE HOURS

11:45.934 --> 11:48.700
WITHOUT SINKING
A SHOT.

11:52.600 --> 11:55.600
SO HOW'S IT FEEL
TO BE DATING
A WINNER?

11:55.600 --> 11:59.500
I'LL LET YOU KNOW
AS SOON AS I FIND ONE.

11:59.500 --> 12:02.500
SO YOU'LL
CALL ME THEN?

12:02.500 --> 12:05.133
SHE WAS TOO GOOD
FOR YOU, MATTHEWS.

12:05.133 --> 12:07.100
YOU'RE RIGHT.
SHE JUST
HELD ME BACK.

12:07.100 --> 12:10.500
I KNOW <i>I </i>FEEL
A LOT LESS PRESSURE.

12:10.500 --> 12:11.834
ALL RIGHT, FRANKIE,

12:11.834 --> 12:14.700
LET'S PLAY SOME POOL.

12:40.300 --> 12:42.000
I SAW THAT COMING.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.400
NO, REALLY, I DID.

12:50.133 --> 12:51.967
TIME ME, COR.

12:51.967 --> 12:54.900
MR. FEENY,
CAN I BORROW YOUR WATCH?

12:54.900 --> 12:55.900
NO.

12:55.900 --> 12:57.700
WHAT IS HE DOING,
ANYWAY?

12:57.700 --> 13:00.300
HE'S TRYING TO BEAT
HIS PREVIOUS RECORD--

13:00.300 --> 13:02.767
7 1/2 HOURS.

13:03.834 --> 13:05.667
MR. HUNTER,
HAVE YOU EVER CONSIDERED

13:05.667 --> 13:07.834
WHAT 7 1/2 HOURS
OF SCHOOLWORK

13:07.834 --> 13:10.800
WOULD DO
FOR YOUR HISTORY GRADES?

13:10.800 --> 13:11.867
MR. FEENY,

13:11.867 --> 13:14.000
THIS SPOON TRICK BRINGS
PLEASURE TO OTHERS.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.400
DO YOU ENJOY DOING THAT?

13:15.400 --> 13:19.500
YEAH. WHAT DO YOU
DO HERE FOR FUN?

13:19.500 --> 13:21.667
I READ BOOKS.
CARE TO JOIN ME?

13:21.667 --> 13:24.967
RIGHT. AND IF YOU
JUMPED OFF A BRIDGE,

13:24.967 --> 13:26.300
I'M SUPPOSED TO
DO THAT, TOO.

13:26.300 --> 13:29.800
HERE, GO FOR THE GOLD.

13:31.600 --> 13:33.700
WHAT IS HIS PROBLEM?

13:33.700 --> 13:35.233
SHAWN, I THINK
IT'S YOUR PROBLEM.

13:35.233 --> 13:37.834
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
HE HATES ME.

13:37.834 --> 13:39.500
NO, HE DOESN'T.

13:39.500 --> 13:41.100
FEENY'S NOT A BAD GUY.

13:41.100 --> 13:42.400
YOU KNOW THE BRITISH--

13:42.400 --> 13:44.600
STIFF, BUT BENEATH
THE SURFACE--

13:44.600 --> 13:46.200
THERE'S STILL MORE
FEENY.

13:46.200 --> 13:47.300
A GUY LIKE HIM

13:47.300 --> 13:51.200
IS NEVER GOING
TO UNDERSTAND
A GUY LIKE ME.

13:51.200 --> 13:52.767
WE ARE
COMPLETE OPPOSITES.

13:52.767 --> 13:54.300
YOU SHOULD GIVE HIM
A CHANCE.

13:54.300 --> 13:57.867
O.K. I'LL GIVE HIM
A CHANCE.

14:02.934 --> 14:04.600
MR. FEENY...

14:04.600 --> 14:07.600
WHY DO YOU HATE ME
SO MUCH?

14:07.600 --> 14:08.867
I BEG YOUR PARDON?

14:08.867 --> 14:13.300
I WANT TO KNOW
WHY YOU HATE ME
SO MUCH.

14:16.934 --> 14:19.000
IS THAT WHAT YOU THINK?

14:19.000 --> 14:22.100
YEAH. YOU'RE ALWAYS
GETTING ON MY CASE.

14:22.100 --> 14:25.400
IF YOU MEAN I WANT YOU
TO DO YOUR BEST,

14:25.400 --> 14:28.500
THEN YES,
I'M ALWAYS ON YOUR CASE.

14:28.500 --> 14:32.367
BUT...I CERTAINLY
DON'T HATE YOU.

14:32.367 --> 14:33.367
YOU SEE, SHAWN?

14:33.367 --> 14:37.000
IT FRUSTRATES ME
TO SEE SUCH A...

14:37.000 --> 14:38.233
CHARISMATIC YOUNG MAN

14:38.233 --> 14:41.767
WITH SO MUCH
UNFULFILLED POTENTIAL.

14:41.767 --> 14:43.000
YEAH, I GOTCHA.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.467
I'M JUST
ANOTHER ONE OF YOUR
HOPELESS STUDENTS.

14:45.467 --> 14:51.600
AND I SUPPOSE
I'M JUST ANOTHER
STODGY OLD PRINCIPAL.

14:51.600 --> 14:53.000
THE STODGIEST.

14:53.000 --> 14:57.200
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT ME,
MR. HUNTER?

14:59.300 --> 15:00.300
[CHUCKLES]

15:00.300 --> 15:03.000
LIKE YOU KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT ME?

15:03.000 --> 15:04.033
WELL, LET'S SEE.

15:04.033 --> 15:10.000
SHAWN PATRICK HUNTER,
SON OF CHET AND VERNA.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.133
BORN IN OHIO,
LIVED IN OKLAHOMA,

15:12.133 --> 15:16.734
IN AND OUT
OF 5 SCHOOLS
BEFORE HE WAS 12.

15:16.734 --> 15:19.800
YOU MEMORIZED
MY TRANSCRIPT.

15:19.800 --> 15:24.200
OH, AND YOU LOVE
A MUSICAL GROUP NAMED...

15:24.200 --> 15:26.834
COUNTING CROWS.

15:26.834 --> 15:30.400
THAT'S NOT
IN MY TRANSCRIPT.

15:30.400 --> 15:31.700
DO YOU KNOW
THAT MUCH

15:31.700 --> 15:33.567
ABOUT ALL
YOUR STUDENTS?

15:33.567 --> 15:37.467
NO, I DON'T.

15:38.667 --> 15:41.500
WELL, MAYBE YOU CAN
GIVE ME A HAND

15:41.500 --> 15:42.567
WITH THESE DISHES.

15:42.567 --> 15:44.767
IF YOU KNOW
EVERYTHING ABOUT ME,

15:44.767 --> 15:47.400
YOU MUST KNOW
I HATE DOING DISHES.

15:47.400 --> 15:49.133
HO HO, GOOD TRY.

15:49.133 --> 15:50.133
COME ON.

15:50.133 --> 15:51.500
SO, MR. FEENY,

15:51.500 --> 15:53.100
TELL US ABOUT YOU.

15:53.100 --> 15:55.667
WELL, THOSE CLOSEST
TO ME WOULD SAY

15:55.667 --> 15:58.233
THAT I ALSO
DISLIKE DOING DISHES.

15:58.233 --> 16:02.200
SO, GENTLEMEN,
I GIVE YOU THE SINK.

16:06.367 --> 16:07.467
OH, LOOK OUT!
MY WATCH!

16:07.467 --> 16:09.367
OH! NO PROBLEM,
MR. FEENY.

16:09.367 --> 16:11.400
GOT IT! GOT IT!

16:12.700 --> 16:14.200
HAD IT.

16:18.600 --> 16:19.734
I'M SORRY.

16:19.734 --> 16:21.100
WH--

16:24.133 --> 16:28.734
WELL, IT'S
NOTHING BUT
A 30-YEAR-OLD WATCH.

16:29.900 --> 16:33.800
ABOUT TIME I GOT
ANOTHER ONE,
I SUPPOSE.

16:44.200 --> 16:46.300
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

16:46.300 --> 16:47.600
I'M READING.

16:47.600 --> 16:48.600
NO, REALLY.

16:48.600 --> 16:52.000
THIS BOOK
FEENY WAS LOOKING AT,

16:52.000 --> 16:53.100
IT'S SOME KIND
OF DIARY.

16:53.100 --> 16:55.467
SHAWN,
YOU'RE READING
FEENY'S DIARY!

16:55.467 --> 16:56.700
ARE YOU CRAZY?

16:56.700 --> 16:58.033
ARE YOU NUTS?

16:58.033 --> 16:59.967
ARE WE IN IT?

16:59.967 --> 17:01.867
HE KNEW
SO MUCH ABOUT ME,

17:01.867 --> 17:03.467
I WANTED
TO FIND OUT ABOUT HIM.

17:03.467 --> 17:08.000
DO YOU KNOW HE
USED TO COME UP HERE
WITH HIS WIFE?

17:08.000 --> 17:09.567
YEAH,
I KNEW THAT.

17:09.567 --> 17:12.300
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
HE WAS MARRIED.

17:12.300 --> 17:13.367
LISTEN TO THIS--

17:13.367 --> 17:15.467
"DECEMBER 18, 1961,

17:15.467 --> 17:18.300
"I CALLED IN SICK
SO LILLIAN AND I

17:18.300 --> 17:21.300
"COULD SNEAK UP HERE
FOR A THREE-DAY WEEKEND.

17:21.300 --> 17:23.834
HA!
FEENY CUT CLASS.

17:23.834 --> 17:26.100
"I SUPPOSE MY STUDENTS
WILL MISS ME,

17:26.100 --> 17:27.100
"BUT NOW AND THEN,

17:27.100 --> 17:29.100
YOU HAVE TO BREAK
THE RULES."

17:29.100 --> 17:30.767
HE SOUNDS
LIKE YOU, SHAWN.

17:30.767 --> 17:31.767
MORE THAN YOU THINK.

17:31.767 --> 17:33.700
"DECEMBER 19th."
THE NEXT DAY.

17:33.700 --> 17:38.200
"LILLIAN AND I
NEVER MADE IT
TO THE SLOPES.

17:38.200 --> 17:39.667
"NO REGRETS."

17:40.734 --> 17:42.700
FEENY, YOU DOG!

17:42.700 --> 17:45.700
LET'S SEE HERE.

17:45.700 --> 17:47.400
"FEBRUARY 14, 1965.

17:47.400 --> 17:50.934
"LILLIAN AND MY
FIFTH ANNIVERSARY.

17:50.934 --> 17:53.600
"STILL NO SIGN
OF THE SLOPES.

17:53.600 --> 17:55.767
"IN THE EVENING
WE EXCHANGED GIFTS.

17:55.767 --> 17:59.400
"AS I LIFTED
THE WRISTWATCH
OUT OF ITS BOX,

"A SMILE THAT LIT
THE NIGHT SKY.

HIS WRISTWATCH.

"THAT WATCH WILL
KEEP TIME BUT FOR
A MOMENT IN TIME,

18:17.033 --> 18:22.200
BUT HER SMILE
WILL REFLECT IN
ITS FACE FOREVER."

18:27.934 --> 18:28.934
GOOD MORNING.

18:28.934 --> 18:32.600
I JUST NEED A FLASHLIGHT
AND A WETSUIT.

18:32.600 --> 18:33.600
WETSUIT?

18:33.600 --> 18:34.734
CORY!

18:34.734 --> 18:36.667
CAN'T TALK.
SHAWN'S IN OVER HIS HEAD.

18:36.667 --> 18:39.233
HEY! MR. FEENY.

18:39.233 --> 18:41.834
OH, MY GOD.

18:41.834 --> 18:44.100
YOU'RE DRIPPING
ON THE RUG.

18:44.100 --> 18:45.400
AND YOU REEK!

18:45.400 --> 18:46.734
SORRY, BUT YOUR
SEPTIC TANK'S

18:46.734 --> 18:50.033
A LOT DEEPER
THAN IT LOOKS.

18:50.033 --> 18:51.233
ALL RIGHT,
THAT DOES IT.

18:51.233 --> 18:52.567
I TRIED TO BE PATIENT,

18:52.567 --> 18:55.934
BUT THIS NONSENSE
HAS GONE FAR ENOUGH.

18:55.934 --> 18:57.767
BEFORE YOU GET MAD--

18:57.767 --> 18:58.767
I'M ALREADY MAD!

18:58.767 --> 19:00.567
I DON'T WANT
TO HEAR A WORD

19:00.567 --> 19:04.233
FROM YOU TWO
UNTIL WE GET BACK.

19:05.500 --> 19:07.900
MR. FEENY...

19:11.033 --> 19:13.000
MY WATCH?

19:14.200 --> 19:16.567
HOPE IT STILL WORKS.

19:20.967 --> 19:24.233
NEVER THOUGHT
I'D SEE THIS AGAIN.

19:24.233 --> 19:28.500
WE FIGURED
IT MEANT
A LOT TO YOU,

19:28.500 --> 19:30.500
BEING YOUR
ANNIVERSARY
WATCH.

19:32.600 --> 19:35.300
YOU READ A BOOK,
MR. HUNTER?

19:35.300 --> 19:38.200
GUESS I DID.

19:39.600 --> 19:41.367
WELL, GOOD FOR YOU.

19:43.000 --> 19:44.934
I WANT
TO THANK YOU BOTH.

19:44.934 --> 19:50.000
WELL, BEFORE WE
GET INTO THE CAR,

19:50.000 --> 19:52.500
WHY DON'T YOU TWO
TAKE A DIP IN THE LAKE

19:52.500 --> 19:54.100
AND GET CLEANED UP.

19:55.567 --> 19:58.200
BUT IT'S LIKE
20 DEGREES
OUT THERE.

19:58.200 --> 19:59.300
WE'LL FREEZE.

19:59.300 --> 20:01.500
TAKE A SWEATER.

20:13.467 --> 20:16.200
WHAT THE HECK
WERE YOU TWO THINKING?

20:16.200 --> 20:17.900
YOU LIED,
YOU TRESPASSED,

20:17.900 --> 20:20.200
AND YOU ENDANGERED
YOURSELVES.

20:20.200 --> 20:21.300
YOU'RE IN IT A LOT DEEPER

20:21.300 --> 20:23.033
THAN YOU WERE
IN THAT SEPTIC TANK.

20:23.033 --> 20:24.500
GEORGE,
I AM VERY SORRY.

20:24.500 --> 20:28.600
BUT BELIEVE ME,
THE PUNISHMENT
<i>WILL </i>FIT THE CRIME.

20:28.600 --> 20:30.200
WELL, FINE,
BUT BEAR IN MIND--

20:30.200 --> 20:31.567
THEIR BEHAVIOR
WAS WRONG,

20:31.567 --> 20:34.000
BUT THEIR SPIRIT
IS RIGHT.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.967
THEY'RE TWO GOOD GUYS.

20:36.967 --> 20:39.100
I'M PULLING FOR YOU.

20:41.900 --> 20:44.000
OH, UH, MR. FEENY...

20:45.133 --> 20:46.400
YOUR KEY.

20:46.400 --> 20:48.700
THOUGHT YOU'D
NEED IT WHEN
YOU SELL THE PLACE.

20:48.700 --> 20:51.300
<i>IF </i>I SELL IT.

20:51.300 --> 20:54.600
OH, AND,
THIS IS YOURS, TOO.

20:55.867 --> 20:59.100
GUYS!
WE'RE NOT FINISHED
WITH YOU YET.

20:59.100 --> 21:01.400
GENTLEMEN,
A WORD OF ADVICE.

21:01.400 --> 21:05.100
DON'T TALK.
NOD A LOT.

21:14.900 --> 21:17.500
I STILL DON'T GET IT.

21:22.400 --> 21:23.400
AH!

21:23.400 --> 21:24.400
HEY!

21:24.400 --> 21:26.700
WHAT,
IS IT MY SHOT?

21:26.700 --> 21:29.233
MATTHEWS, IT'S OVER.

21:29.233 --> 21:31.467
YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN
PLAYING 15 HOURS

21:31.467 --> 21:32.667
WITHOUT SINKING
A BALL!

21:32.667 --> 21:33.700
BESIDES,

21:33.700 --> 21:35.233
I GOT TO GET
TO CHURCH.

21:35.233 --> 21:36.300
CHOIR PRACTICE.

21:36.300 --> 21:37.600
ALTO, YOU KNOW?

21:37.600 --> 21:39.900
HE SINGS LIKE
AN ANGEL.
