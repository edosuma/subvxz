WITH US TAKING
THIS MUCH SYRUP?

20:50.133 --> 20:51.433
- PLEASE, I HAVE MORE
THAN I CAN HANDLE.

20:51.467 --> 20:54.066
I THINK THAT YELLOW-BEARDED
SYRUP MAKER WAS IN LOVE WITH ME.

20:54.100 --> 20:55.633
- OH, HE IS--THE LAST TIME
WE WERE AT THE CABIN,

20:55.667 --> 20:57.600
GOOD OL' PEEBEARD
WAS ALL UP IN YOUR BUSINESS.

20:57.633 --> 20:59.066
- MAGGIE, YOU ARE BAD!

20:59.100 --> 21:00.233
[laughter]

21:00.233 --> 21:02.100
- OH, GUYS, TOO SOON.
OKAY.

21:02.100 --> 21:03.667
- WELL, IT'S A SHAME THAT
OUR TIME'S COMING TO AN END.

21:03.700 --> 21:05.200
IT'S BEEN A DELIGHT.
- OH, WELL, WAIT!

21:05.233 --> 21:06.333
MOM, I MEAN, WE'RE HERE.

21:06.367 --> 21:07.734
WE COULD STICK AROUND,
HAVE SOME CHAMOMILE,

21:07.767 --> 21:09.233
MAYBE CUDDLE UP
WITH THOSE KASHMIR THROWS

21:09.266 --> 21:10.467
YOU GAVE TO MAGGIE
BUT NOT ME.

21:10.500 --> 21:11.567
- YEAH, I'M NOT IN THE MOOD
FOR TEA.

21:11.600 --> 21:13.266
- OKAY, GWEN,
SHE CAME FOR THE SYRUP.

21:13.300 --> 21:15.533
THIS IS WHAT
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT.

21:15.567 --> 21:17.633
- MRS. CRAWFORD, I CHANGED OUT
ALL THE LIGHT BULBS.

21:17.667 --> 21:18.734
ANYTHING ELSE
YOU NEED ME TO DO?

21:18.767 --> 21:21.033
- OH...MY...GOD.
- HOLY CRAP.

21:21.066 --> 21:22.367
- UH, YES, STEVE.

21:22.400 --> 21:25.500
AS A MATTER OF FACT, I HAVE
SOME VERY HEAVY PAVING STONES

21:25.500 --> 21:27.233
IN THE BACKYARD,
AND...

21:27.266 --> 21:28.567
I'D LIKE YOU
TO MOVE THEM FOR ME.

21:28.600 --> 21:30.133
- WELL, THAT'S GONNA BE
A DIRTY JOB.

21:30.133 --> 21:31.400
I'LL HAVE
TO TAKE OFF MY SHIRT.

21:31.400 --> 21:34.066
- THAT'S FINE, STEVE.
THAT'S JUST FINE.

21:34.100 --> 21:35.567
[laughter]

21:35.600 --> 21:39.233
- OH, MY--I CANNOT BELIEVE
MY MOM IS AN OLD HORNDOG.

21:39.266 --> 21:41.000
- [scoffs]
LIKE MOTHER, LIKE DAUGHTER.

21:41.033 --> 21:44.000
- OKAY, NOT KEWL, OKAY?
TOTALLY NOT KEWL.
