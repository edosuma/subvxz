this is funny?

00:26.159 --> 00:27.994

Think she's single?

00:39.840 --> 00:41.675

it's from outer space.

You have
something to say?

No, sir.

00:48.048 --> 00:49.349
When you get
the clap

00:49.382 --> 00:50.884
'cause you weren't paying
attention in health class,

00:50.917 --> 00:52.118
is that gonna
be funny, too?

00:52.886 --> 00:54.087
No.

00:54.888 --> 00:56.322

No, idiot,
it jumped out

Shut up.

01:15.876 --> 01:17.177
MR. FREDRICKS:
All right, Weir!

01:17.210 --> 01:18.879
Since you seem
to know everything,

01:18.912 --> 01:20.280
you know what,
I got a great idea.

01:20.313 --> 01:22.082
Why don't I
shut my big mouth,

01:22.115 --> 01:23.617
and you come up
and teach the class.

01:24.551 --> 01:25.652
Sorry.

01:25.686 --> 01:27.487
I said get up here.

01:30.190 --> 01:31.758
MR. FREDRICKS:
Get up here!
Let's go.

01:36.997 --> 01:40.300
Oh, uh, excuse me,
Dr. Love?

01:40.333 --> 01:43.570
Can you show me
where the ovaries
are located?

01:45.238 --> 01:47.240
Ovaries?
Ovaries.

01:49.676 --> 01:51.612
(IMITATES BUZZER)
Sorry.

01:51.645 --> 01:54.648
Uh, cervix?
Cervix.

01:58.619 --> 01:59.753
Cervix.

No.

Hey, all right...

02:05.391 --> 02:07.561
Pachowski, you want
to go help him?

02:07.594 --> 02:08.762
Huh?

02:08.795 --> 02:10.330
The vagina, Weir,
the va...

02:10.363 --> 02:11.497
Easy one,
easy one.

02:11.532 --> 02:12.966
Basic stuff,
guys know it.

02:12.999 --> 02:14.300
Go ahead,
point to it.

02:20.941 --> 02:22.676
I... I don't know.

02:24.945 --> 02:26.479
All right, Mr. Weir,

02:27.447 --> 02:28.882
instead of
yucking it up
in class,

02:28.915 --> 02:30.183
you might want
to pay attention,

02:30.216 --> 02:32.753
or you're going
to have a very
difficult life.

02:32.786 --> 02:34.755
Okay? Sit down,
Dr. Love.

Hey, good game
on Saturday, Eddie.

03:45.592 --> 03:46.693
Jennifer,

03:46.727 --> 03:48.261
I've been hearing
some terrific
things about you

03:48.294 --> 03:50.163
from my sources
in the English
department.

03:50.196 --> 03:51.598
As you were.

03:51.632 --> 03:53.166
Hey, Brad.

03:53.199 --> 03:54.234
Haven't seen you
in a while.

03:54.267 --> 03:56.002
Stop by the office.
We'll rap.

03:56.036 --> 03:57.638
Sure thing,
Mr. Rosso.

03:59.906 --> 04:01.374
Peace,
brother.

04:05.145 --> 04:06.547
Rock on,
Kirby.

04:08.582 --> 04:11.652
Okay, Mr. Desario,
it's time for your
favorite class.

04:17.290 --> 04:19.325
Okay, come on,
people,
simmer down.

04:19.359 --> 04:20.561
Come on,
let's go.

04:21.461 --> 04:22.963
This is my time,
not yours.

04:22.996 --> 04:25.599
Hey, chatty Cathy,
you sit on the furniture
at home?

04:27.133 --> 04:29.435
Okay, a reminder about
tomorrow's test.

04:30.136 --> 04:31.738
It's tomorrow.

04:31.772 --> 04:33.607
Uh, Kowchevski?

04:34.174 --> 04:35.441
Desario.

04:36.409 --> 04:38.845
Didn't we take
a test last week?

04:38.879 --> 04:40.180
Your point?

04:40.213 --> 04:41.347
Well, I just
don't think

04:41.381 --> 04:42.949
you've taught us enough
in the past week

04:42.983 --> 04:44.384
to give us
another test.

04:46.219 --> 04:48.288
Okay, people,
in math,

04:48.321 --> 04:50.390
every week,
you build off

04:50.423 --> 04:52.526
what you learned
the week before.

04:52.559 --> 04:53.994
I mean,
it's like a bus.

04:54.027 --> 04:55.361
And you keep
missing the bus,

04:55.395 --> 04:57.197
you're never gonna
be able to catch up.

04:57.230 --> 05:00.300
But, uh, I don't
ride the bus, sir.

05:01.802 --> 05:03.670
Yeah, flunk
another test,
Desario,

05:03.704 --> 05:06.607
and you just
might have to come
back here next year

05:06.640 --> 05:08.675
and ride the bus
with me again.

05:11.612 --> 05:13.146
So the guy looks
up at her, right,

05:13.179 --> 05:16.482
and he says,
"How do you think
I rang the doorbell?"

05:18.484 --> 05:20.020
JOCK: That's
so raunchy.

05:20.053 --> 05:21.321
I don't
get it.

05:21.354 --> 05:22.455
What's to get?

05:22.488 --> 05:24.390
Jocks don't know
how to tell jokes.

05:25.091 --> 05:26.993
Do you get it?

05:27.027 --> 05:28.394
I don't really
like jokes.

05:28.428 --> 05:29.696
I don't think
they're funny.

05:29.730 --> 05:31.131
I mean,
maybe if we
understood it,

05:31.164 --> 05:32.298
it would
be funny.

05:32.332 --> 05:33.700
They were
laughing
pretty hard.

05:33.734 --> 05:35.235
Trust me,
they're idiots.

05:35.268 --> 05:36.603
It's not funny.

05:39.973 --> 05:41.241
Hi, Sam.

05:41.274 --> 05:43.744
Oh...
Hi, Cindy.

05:44.377 --> 05:45.411
How are you?

05:45.445 --> 05:46.647
I'm good.
And you?

05:47.080 --> 05:48.381
Uh, pretty good.

05:48.414 --> 05:50.483
Are you going to
the muscular dystrophy
carnival?

05:50.517 --> 05:52.519
I'm in charge of
the ice cream booth.

05:52.553 --> 05:54.888
Yeah, I heard
about that.

05:54.921 --> 05:56.557
Oh, hey,
Dr. Love,

05:56.590 --> 05:58.358
hey, I can't find
my girlfriend's cervix.

05:58.391 --> 05:59.660
Can you
help me out?

06:02.328 --> 06:04.264
Okay, what was
that all about?

06:04.297 --> 06:07.400
Oh, that was just...
An inside joke.

06:08.869 --> 06:10.103
Anyways,

06:10.136 --> 06:12.539
if you need
another volunteer

06:12.573 --> 06:14.240
for the ice cream booth,

06:14.274 --> 06:15.509
I'm around.

06:15.542 --> 06:17.878
Well, thanks,
but Betsy's
already doing it.

06:17.911 --> 06:19.646
But make sure you
stop by, though.

06:20.013 --> 06:21.047
Okay.

06:21.081 --> 06:22.983
All right,
see ya.

06:24.284 --> 06:25.351
Hey, Tommy,
are you coming

06:25.385 --> 06:27.087
to the muscular
dystrophy carnival?

06:27.120 --> 06:29.122
Excuse me,
Dr. Love?

06:29.155 --> 06:30.857
Would you autograph
my genitals?

06:34.394 --> 06:36.329
I took 20 bucks
from my mom, right?

06:36.362 --> 06:38.464
But she thought
it was my brother.

06:38.498 --> 06:40.400
She completely
went nuts on him,

06:40.433 --> 06:42.002
hit him
over the head
with a spatula,

06:42.035 --> 06:43.637
I mean,
it was hilarious.

06:43.970 --> 06:45.438
Sounds it.

06:46.339 --> 06:48.842
God! You bastard!
Why'd you do that?

06:48.875 --> 06:49.776
I don't know.

06:49.810 --> 06:52.045
God, what are you,
lit or something?

06:52.078 --> 06:53.547
You know? Jeez!

06:53.580 --> 06:55.381
I'm sorry.
Mellow out,
all right?

06:55.415 --> 06:56.650
How do you
like it?

06:56.683 --> 06:58.552
You know, now I gotta
walk around all day

06:58.585 --> 06:59.620
with pop on my shirt.

06:59.653 --> 07:00.887
You know?
Thanks a lot.

07:00.921 --> 07:01.988
Yeah, yeah.

07:05.025 --> 07:08.595
I get these
weird urges
sometimes.

07:08.629 --> 07:10.864
I should
probably go
apologize.

07:18.972 --> 07:19.973
Hey.

07:20.340 --> 07:21.775
Hey.

07:21.808 --> 07:22.809
Are you okay?

07:23.677 --> 07:24.711
Yeah.

07:26.446 --> 07:28.882
Kowchevski
says if I flunk
this test tomorrow

07:28.915 --> 07:30.817
I'll have to
take Algebra again.

07:30.851 --> 07:32.553
Do you think
you might flunk it?

07:34.154 --> 07:35.956
No, I'm definitely
gonna flunk it.

07:40.894 --> 07:42.095
Do you take Algebra?

07:42.128 --> 07:44.230
Uh, no.
I took it last year.

07:44.264 --> 07:46.332
I take trig.

07:46.366 --> 07:48.602
You must
study a lot.

07:48.635 --> 07:51.071
Math isn't this big deal
that everyone thinks it is.

07:51.104 --> 07:53.740
It's just a few basic
formulas and some shortcuts,

07:53.774 --> 07:55.175
and then you
plug in the numbers...

07:55.208 --> 07:56.242
Shortcuts?

07:56.276 --> 07:57.844
You mean,
like, tricks?

07:57.878 --> 07:59.546
You could
call them that.

08:00.747 --> 08:03.249
You could definitely do it
if you wanted to.

08:03.283 --> 08:05.351
Oh, yeah, I know.

08:05.385 --> 08:08.889
I mean, if I study,
I could do it.

08:08.922 --> 08:11.024
It's not like
I'm a bus driver.

08:12.826 --> 08:14.360
It's just, you know,
it doesn't interest me.

08:14.394 --> 08:15.829
It's so lame.

08:15.862 --> 08:18.464
But do you really want
to be in Kowchevski's
class again?

08:18.498 --> 08:19.566
Hell, no.

08:19.600 --> 08:21.267
I'd rather
be in jail.

08:22.468 --> 08:24.204
Well, I could
help you study.

08:25.238 --> 08:27.040
It could be
kind of fun.

08:30.176 --> 08:31.111
So the guy says,

08:31.144 --> 08:33.079
"How do you think
I rang the doorbell?"

08:36.583 --> 08:38.018
So it is funny.

08:38.051 --> 08:39.319
What does
it mean?

08:39.352 --> 08:40.787
You guys are so young.

08:40.821 --> 08:42.823
You're only
a year older
than we are.

08:42.856 --> 08:44.758
Yeah, come on, Harris,
what does it mean?

08:45.892 --> 08:47.528
NEAL: He doesn't
get it, either.

08:47.994 --> 08:49.295
Oh, I get it.

08:49.329 --> 08:50.363
Then tell us.

08:50.396 --> 08:52.599
HARRIS: I can't.
Why not?

08:52.633 --> 08:53.667
'Cause then
you'd know.

08:53.700 --> 08:55.702
So, that's
the point,
isn't it?

08:55.736 --> 08:58.238
You have to find out
for yourselves.

08:58.271 --> 08:59.840
SAM:
That's why
we're asking.

08:59.873 --> 09:01.742
I told you.
He doesn't know.

09:01.775 --> 09:03.810
If I didn't know,
would I be with
Judith here?

09:03.844 --> 09:05.912
Oh, Harris,
you're so bad.

09:13.319 --> 09:15.121
Love is like homework.

09:15.155 --> 09:17.257
You got to study
if you want
to get an "A."

09:19.292 --> 09:23.730
So then the guy says,
"How do you think
I rang the doorbell?"

09:25.265 --> 09:26.466
Do you
get it?

09:26.499 --> 09:27.701
I don't.

09:29.335 --> 09:30.336
Dad?

09:31.337 --> 09:32.372
No.

09:32.405 --> 09:33.607
You know
who's funny?

09:33.640 --> 09:35.241
That Red Buttons.

09:35.275 --> 09:36.309
(DOORBELL RINGS)

09:37.477 --> 09:38.512
Who could
that be?

09:38.545 --> 09:39.846
Oh, that's Daniel.

09:39.880 --> 09:41.114
He's a friend
of mine from school.

09:41.147 --> 09:42.516
HAROLD: I'll get the door.

09:42.549 --> 09:44.718
It's dark out,
and you're a... A girl.

09:49.489 --> 09:51.224
Hi, is, uh,
Lindsay here?

09:51.925 --> 09:52.926
Yeah.

09:58.932 --> 10:03.236
Okay, so...
How do you
want to do this?

10:03.269 --> 10:06.206
I don't know.
I've never done
this before.

10:07.340 --> 10:09.676
Okay, well,
in your textbook...

10:10.544 --> 10:12.145
Did you bring
your textbook?

10:12.546 --> 10:13.814
No.

10:13.847 --> 10:15.882
I probably
should have,
huh?

10:16.917 --> 10:17.918
Yeah.

10:19.485 --> 10:20.687
Man...

10:22.789 --> 10:24.057
Screwed up
already.

10:24.991 --> 10:26.492
No, it's okay.

10:26.527 --> 10:28.695
I think I have mine
from last year.

10:30.030 --> 10:31.131
Oh, great.

10:31.164 --> 10:33.800
You know, there's
these practice tests
in here.

10:33.834 --> 10:35.836
And they're
kind of helpful.

10:35.869 --> 10:39.640
Just talking about
studying makes me
want to take a nap.

10:39.673 --> 10:41.074
Hey, wait,
what are you doing?

10:42.175 --> 10:43.376
What?

10:43.409 --> 10:44.811
You can't
smoke in here.

10:44.845 --> 10:46.479
I... I mean,
I don't care.

10:46.513 --> 10:47.748
It's just,
my parents.

10:47.781 --> 10:49.950
Oh, right,
I... I'm sorry.

10:50.717 --> 10:52.085
I got an idea.

10:53.920 --> 10:55.922
I'll go outside
and smoke this.

10:56.456 --> 10:58.424
But when I get back,

10:58.458 --> 11:00.260
blaze through those
tricks of yours.

11:20.781 --> 11:22.015
What you
got there?

11:23.416 --> 11:24.985
Uh, um...

11:25.719 --> 11:26.920
Nothing.

11:28.522 --> 11:29.723
Nothing?

11:30.190 --> 11:31.191
What's that?

11:35.562 --> 11:36.797
Let me see.

11:38.932 --> 11:41.401
These types of books
just make me think
of all the crap

11:41.434 --> 11:42.969
that can go wrong
inside you.

11:44.638 --> 11:45.972
Why you
reading this?

11:48.308 --> 11:51.945
I'm taking sex ed
with Mr. Fredricks.

11:52.746 --> 11:53.814
He embarrassed me

11:53.847 --> 11:54.981
in front of
the whole class

11:55.015 --> 11:56.817
just because
I'm a little
bit behind

11:56.850 --> 11:58.251
when it comes to
that sort of stuff.

11:59.119 --> 12:00.821
Yeah, I know
how that goes.

12:03.123 --> 12:04.858
You do?

12:04.891 --> 12:06.059
You know,
you're not gonna learn

12:06.092 --> 12:07.961
anything you can use
from a book like that.

12:10.697 --> 12:11.998
I'm not?

12:12.032 --> 12:13.033
No.

12:17.403 --> 12:18.404
I tell you what.

12:19.940 --> 12:21.808
I'll find you
at school tomorrow.

12:21.842 --> 12:23.043
I'll set you up.

12:23.777 --> 12:25.478
With what?

12:25.512 --> 12:27.047
Don't worry.
It's cool.

12:33.987 --> 12:36.690
So, let's try
a different one.

12:36.723 --> 12:40.393
How do you solve
this type of problem?

12:43.463 --> 12:45.098
Use the quadratic
formula?

12:45.131 --> 12:46.633
Exactly.

12:46.667 --> 12:48.935
And what is
the quadratic formula?

12:50.604 --> 12:52.072
"X" equals...

12:55.809 --> 12:57.110
Negative "B,"

12:58.411 --> 12:59.479
Plus or minus...

12:59.513 --> 13:00.547
The square root...

13:00.581 --> 13:01.848
Lindsay...

13:01.882 --> 13:03.349
When you told me
you were gonna
teach me tricks,

13:03.383 --> 13:05.285
I thought you meant,
like, real tricks.

13:05.318 --> 13:08.288
What do you mean,
like magic tricks?

13:08.321 --> 13:09.623
Yeah, well, sort of.

13:09.656 --> 13:12.593
I mean, right now
you're kind of just
teaching me math.

13:12.626 --> 13:14.728
But, yeah,
but you're gonna get it.

13:14.761 --> 13:17.030
I know, but I can't
learn all this.

13:17.063 --> 13:18.532
The test
is tomorrow.

13:19.232 --> 13:20.233
There's no way.

13:21.067 --> 13:23.003
I... I don't know
what else to do.

13:26.773 --> 13:28.208
I'll be cool.

13:28.241 --> 13:29.242
Really?

13:31.177 --> 13:32.178
Yeah.

13:34.247 --> 13:36.182
Hey, I'm sorry
for wasting your time.

13:36.917 --> 13:40.153
No. You didn't.

13:40.787 --> 13:41.922
Okay.

13:41.955 --> 13:44.024
Oh, wanna...
You want to
do something?

13:45.091 --> 13:46.560
Well, I don't
think I can.

13:46.593 --> 13:48.261
It's a school night
and everything.

13:49.195 --> 13:50.997
Are you sure
you're okay?

13:51.397 --> 13:52.599
Yeah, fine.

13:53.834 --> 13:54.868
See ya.

13:54.901 --> 13:56.169
Good luck.

13:59.806 --> 14:01.041
See ya tomorrow.

14:02.676 --> 14:05.245
NEAL: The Hulk could
kick the Thing's
butt any day.

14:05.278 --> 14:08.014
SAM: No way! The Thing
could definitely
take the Hulk.

14:08.048 --> 14:09.650
Even if the Hulk
could beat him,

14:09.683 --> 14:10.851
all it has to do
is wait

14:10.884 --> 14:12.986
till the Hulk
turns into
Bill Bixby again

14:13.019 --> 14:14.420
and cream him,
no problem.

14:14.454 --> 14:15.488
You know,
you're right.

14:15.522 --> 14:16.590
Hey, Weir.

14:16.623 --> 14:18.258
Come here.

14:18.291 --> 14:21.061
I got something
you might be
interested in.

14:21.962 --> 14:23.864
Check it out,
but don't lose it.

14:24.497 --> 14:25.532
Okay.

14:25.566 --> 14:26.633
I want it back.

14:28.702 --> 14:30.671
All right.
Right.

14:30.704 --> 14:32.205
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey.

14:33.707 --> 14:35.742
Don't open it
here, man.

14:35.776 --> 14:37.143
I don't want it
getting confiscated,

14:37.177 --> 14:38.411
know what
I'm saying?

14:39.513 --> 14:40.547
Okay.

14:40.581 --> 14:41.582
All right.

14:44.384 --> 14:45.619
Confiscated?

14:46.887 --> 14:48.154
Come on,
let's go.

14:50.791 --> 14:52.659
(DRUMMING
ON LOCKER)

14:53.994 --> 14:55.028
Hey, chump.

14:55.061 --> 14:56.362
I need your help.

14:56.396 --> 14:57.397
Come here.

14:59.566 --> 15:00.634
Come on.
All right.

15:00.667 --> 15:02.603
I need to get
something out of
this classroom.

15:02.636 --> 15:04.270
If you see
Kowchevski
coming,

15:04.304 --> 15:06.406
you just bang
on this door,
all right?

15:07.808 --> 15:09.876
Hey, don't
screw me over.
Look alive.

15:09.910 --> 15:11.512
I'm alive, man.

15:11.545 --> 15:12.846
You don't have
to hit me.

15:12.879 --> 15:14.080
All right.

15:15.849 --> 15:17.317
I'll be out
in a second.

15:19.019 --> 15:20.821
Hey, Nick,
what's up?

15:20.854 --> 15:22.923
Oh, hey,
what's up, Sara?

15:30.664 --> 15:31.998
Did you hear that
Danielle and I

15:32.032 --> 15:33.700
were gonna sing
Super Trouper
at the talent show?

15:33.734 --> 15:34.868
Oh, yeah?

15:34.901 --> 15:36.503
Yeah, we're gonna
dress up like Abba.

15:36.537 --> 15:37.571
Wow.

15:37.604 --> 15:38.672
Abba, huh?

15:38.705 --> 15:40.173
Mm‐hmm.

15:40.206 --> 15:43.977
They're from...
Switzerland, right?

15:44.010 --> 15:46.613
No, I think
they're from
Sweden, actually.

15:49.282 --> 15:51.184
(DRUMMING)

15:51.918 --> 15:52.986
What are you doing?

15:53.019 --> 15:56.289
I'm, uh...
Thinking about Abba.

16:01.595 --> 16:02.729
Yeah, I'll talk
to you later.

16:04.497 --> 16:05.331
All right.

16:05.365 --> 16:07.400
Well, uh,
talk to you later.

16:07.433 --> 16:09.870
I think I'm getting
a wart on my wrist.

16:09.903 --> 16:10.937
Jesus, man,

16:10.971 --> 16:12.172
this Algebra test
is crazy.

16:12.205 --> 16:13.740
What language
is this?

16:13.774 --> 16:15.341
How do you get rid
of a wart?

16:15.375 --> 16:18.011
Hey. I'm trying
to think here, okay?

16:18.044 --> 16:19.445
I'm sorry, man.

16:21.247 --> 16:24.417
It looks like some kind
of movie or something.

16:24.450 --> 16:26.186
Let me see that.
Let me see it.

16:27.554 --> 16:28.589
Hang on.

16:30.957 --> 16:32.726
Oh, my God.

16:32.759 --> 16:34.160
It's a naked woman.

16:35.095 --> 16:36.162
What's she doing?

16:36.196 --> 16:37.531
Who cares what
she's doing?

16:37.564 --> 16:38.565
She's naked.

16:40.233 --> 16:42.002
It's a dirty movie.

16:42.035 --> 16:43.770
You mean,
like a porno?

16:43.804 --> 16:46.439
Oh! Ew! Give me that.

16:48.942 --> 16:51.077
What am I supposed
to do with a porno?

16:51.111 --> 16:52.746
You watch it...

16:52.779 --> 16:54.515
Over and over.

16:54.748 --> 16:55.782
Ew!

16:55.816 --> 16:58.552
Only perverts
watch pornos, right?

16:58.585 --> 17:02.255
Well, then every guy
in America is a pervert.

17:02.288 --> 17:05.425
The meaning
of that joke
is right here.

17:05.458 --> 17:06.960
How am I supposed
to watch it?

17:06.993 --> 17:08.595
I don't even have
a projector.

17:08.629 --> 17:10.463
Well, I do.
Give it to me.

17:11.865 --> 17:14.601
After school today,
we go to my house,

17:14.635 --> 17:16.102
and we watch
this movie

17:16.136 --> 17:17.337
from beginning
to end.

17:18.338 --> 17:19.372
Agreed?

17:19.940 --> 17:21.141
Okay.

17:29.783 --> 17:30.884
Hey.

17:30.917 --> 17:32.452
I ganked the test.

17:33.453 --> 17:34.454
Wait. What?

17:37.257 --> 17:40.026
I stole it from
Kowchevski's office.

17:40.060 --> 17:41.728
He's got no clue.

17:41.762 --> 17:42.796
I need your help.

17:42.829 --> 17:44.464
I can't figure
any of this out.

17:44.497 --> 17:45.799
(STAMMERING)

17:45.832 --> 17:46.833
I can't.

17:49.736 --> 17:50.837
Sure, you can.

17:50.871 --> 17:52.138
This stuff's
easy for you.

17:52.172 --> 17:53.574
No, I mean...

17:54.440 --> 17:55.542
I shouldn't.

17:55.942 --> 17:57.143
Why not?

17:58.645 --> 17:59.646
Hey.

18:04.417 --> 18:05.619
Hey.

18:05.652 --> 18:06.486
Don't worry.

18:06.520 --> 18:08.054
I'm not gonna be
hitting you up

18:08.088 --> 18:09.623
every time
I have a math test.

18:10.156 --> 18:11.391
I promise.

18:17.531 --> 18:18.699
So for this one...

18:21.868 --> 18:24.170
Look, I don't mean
to be uptight,

18:24.838 --> 18:26.306
but it's just...

18:26.339 --> 18:28.374
Why don't I talk
to Kowchevski?

18:29.810 --> 18:31.011
What? Why?

18:31.044 --> 18:32.345
I'll ask him
for an extension.

18:32.378 --> 18:34.781
He gave me one once.
He likes me.

18:34.815 --> 18:36.316
I'll tell him
I'm tutoring you

18:36.349 --> 18:37.618
and that you're getting
the hang of it,

18:37.651 --> 18:39.385
but you just need
a little more time.

18:41.287 --> 18:43.590
Wouldn't it just be easier
to fill out this test?

18:45.025 --> 18:46.593
Let me talk to him, okay?

18:47.427 --> 18:48.361
Forget it.

18:48.394 --> 18:50.196
That dirtbag's not gonna
get an extension.

18:50.230 --> 18:52.265
But, Mr. Kowchevski,
I was working
with him last night,

18:52.298 --> 18:53.734
and he's really learning.

18:53.767 --> 18:55.869
Daniel's the kind
of student

18:55.902 --> 18:57.571
who needs more
attention, you know?

18:57.604 --> 18:59.305
No. Daniel's the kind
of student

18:59.339 --> 19:00.841
who needs to just
disappear.

19:01.908 --> 19:02.976
Excuse me?

19:03.009 --> 19:05.278
Look, he wastes my time.

19:05.311 --> 19:06.980
He wastes class time.

19:07.013 --> 19:09.149
And now he's wasting
your time.

19:09.182 --> 19:11.652
Well, no, he's not wasting
anybody's time.

19:12.753 --> 19:15.088
I mean... Come on,

19:15.121 --> 19:16.657
isn't it your job
to teach him?

19:16.690 --> 19:18.258
Lindsay...

19:19.325 --> 19:22.796
I know Daniel is cute
with his bedroom eyes

19:22.829 --> 19:25.599
and his stringy hair,

19:25.632 --> 19:27.000
but he's a loser.

19:27.033 --> 19:29.503
And losers
pull down winners.

19:30.537 --> 19:33.740
Now...
You're a smart girl.

19:34.808 --> 19:37.177
Don't let your hormones
get in the way.

19:38.645 --> 19:39.746
Excuse me.

19:45.251 --> 19:46.352
Where's that test?

19:46.386 --> 19:48.555
In my jacket.
Let's go.

19:50.056 --> 19:53.326
Okay. 74 times 23...
Put that in parentheses.

19:54.327 --> 19:56.730
And X equals 19Y,

19:56.763 --> 19:59.465
and Y equals eight.

20:00.867 --> 20:03.403
Damn, it's weird you can
do this in your head.

20:03.436 --> 20:05.371
Like a brainiac
or something.

20:06.039 --> 20:07.107
Thanks.

20:07.140 --> 20:09.375
I can't wait to see
Kowchevski's face

20:09.409 --> 20:11.377
when he hands this
back to me.

20:11.411 --> 20:13.146
This will blow his mind.

20:13.179 --> 20:15.315
Yeah, but, Daniel,
this isn't over, right?

20:15.348 --> 20:16.550
I'm gonna tutor you,

20:16.583 --> 20:18.852
and you won't have
to steal any more tests.

20:18.885 --> 20:20.120
No. Yeah. I know.

20:20.153 --> 20:21.688
No. I know.

20:21.722 --> 20:22.923
I'm gonna be, like,

20:22.956 --> 20:24.891
a guy with one of
those things.

20:25.892 --> 20:27.460
An abacus?

20:27.493 --> 20:28.529
Yeah.

20:29.162 --> 20:32.866
7Y4X equals nine...

20:32.899 --> 20:35.268
(LAUGHS)

20:38.539 --> 20:39.873
KOWCHEVSKI:
Come on, people.

20:39.906 --> 20:42.142
This is just a test,
not a death sentence.

20:42.175 --> 20:43.209
If you're prepared,

20:43.243 --> 20:44.511
you got nothin'
to worry about.

21:15.542 --> 21:16.376
Lindsay.

21:16.409 --> 21:18.178
Congratulations.

21:18.211 --> 21:19.312
Turns out
your friend Daniel

21:19.345 --> 21:20.781
didn't need that
extension after all.

21:20.814 --> 21:22.583
He got an "A"
on the Algebra test.

21:23.750 --> 21:26.486
Yeah, well, I told you
I helped him study.

21:26.520 --> 21:27.788
Did you help
him cheat?

21:30.691 --> 21:32.258
No.

21:32.292 --> 21:34.595
I've got
an anonymous note
that says you did.

21:35.095 --> 21:36.329
Well, I didn't.

21:36.362 --> 21:37.664
I didn't cheat.

21:38.431 --> 21:40.266
I think you did.

21:40.300 --> 21:42.335
We'll deal with this
tomorrow.

21:42.368 --> 21:44.304
You're in a lot
of trouble,
young lady.

21:47.407 --> 21:49.075
Why were you talking
to Mr. Kowchevski?

21:49.109 --> 21:50.210
Huh?

21:50.243 --> 21:51.912
Are you joining
the Mathletes again?

21:51.945 --> 21:52.979
No.

21:53.013 --> 21:54.047
Jeez.

21:54.080 --> 21:55.381
Sorry I asked.

22:01.087 --> 22:02.088
(SIGH)

22:03.223 --> 22:04.525
You have
popcorn?

22:04.558 --> 22:05.859
Bill, this is a porno.

22:05.892 --> 22:08.461
You don't eat popcorn
during a porno.

22:08.494 --> 22:10.296
This is taking forever.

22:10.330 --> 22:12.365
Yeah. We could've made
our own porno by now.

22:12.398 --> 22:14.267
Hey, do you want
the projector
to eat the film

22:14.300 --> 22:15.602
and have that
Daniel guy kill you?

22:15.636 --> 22:17.671
'Cause, I mean,
we can do that, too.

22:19.840 --> 22:22.475
All right. There.

22:25.378 --> 22:26.412
Kill the lights.

22:26.446 --> 22:27.814
Aye, aye, sir.

22:31.117 --> 22:32.519
Here we go.

22:37.991 --> 22:38.992
Wow.

22:40.627 --> 22:41.795
Hello.

22:41.828 --> 22:44.030
How'd you like to
come home to that
every night?

22:48.234 --> 22:49.469
Wow.

22:50.170 --> 22:51.638
He's in
good shape.

22:53.106 --> 22:54.107
Ooh!

23:06.386 --> 23:07.821
Uh...

23:08.421 --> 23:11.124
This is weird.

23:22.903 --> 23:23.870
Wow.

23:23.904 --> 23:27.173
That guy's got the best
job in the world.

23:31.512 --> 23:34.581
You think there's any...
Short porn stars?

23:47.327 --> 23:48.394
I'm so dead.

23:48.428 --> 23:49.796
What did you tell
Kowchevski?

23:49.830 --> 23:50.664
Nothing.

23:50.697 --> 23:52.265
Did you tell him
that we cheated?

23:52.298 --> 23:53.667
No.

23:53.700 --> 23:56.102
He could see it
all over my face.

23:56.903 --> 23:58.572
Then it's not over.

23:59.039 --> 24:00.273
Anonymous note?

24:00.306 --> 24:01.808
That means nothing.

24:02.242 --> 24:03.476
Get in.

24:04.511 --> 24:06.212
As long as we don't,
you know, admit it,

24:06.246 --> 24:08.214
they got jack on us.

24:08.248 --> 24:09.783
You wanna deny it?

24:10.316 --> 24:11.384
Yeah, definitely.

24:11.417 --> 24:12.553
Daniel, I don't...

24:12.586 --> 24:14.120
Listen, Lindsay.

24:14.154 --> 24:15.789
You're good at math.

24:15.822 --> 24:17.758
I'm good at this
sort of thing.

24:17.791 --> 24:19.626
And when something
like this happens,

24:19.660 --> 24:21.461
you deny everything.

24:24.998 --> 24:26.533
But I'm not a good liar.

24:28.802 --> 24:31.371
Lindsay, I got you
into this.

24:31.404 --> 24:33.373
I'm gonna get you
out of this.

24:33.406 --> 24:34.741
But you gotta trust me.

24:34.775 --> 24:36.743
We're in this together.

24:43.449 --> 24:45.251
So, you want me
to thread it up again?

24:45.285 --> 24:46.787
I'm goin' home.

24:53.293 --> 24:55.095
Are we gonna
go to Hell
for this?

24:58.298 --> 24:59.833
I don't wanna
go to Hell.

25:05.238 --> 25:06.807
Hey, Sam.

25:06.840 --> 25:09.009
You hardly touched
your chicken a la king.

25:09.042 --> 25:10.143
Aren't you hungry?

25:11.978 --> 25:12.979
Huh?

25:13.814 --> 25:14.748
Uh, no.

25:14.781 --> 25:19.653
I had a really big
snack at Neal's.

25:20.554 --> 25:21.888
After school.

25:23.990 --> 25:25.358
May I be excused?

25:25.391 --> 25:29.996
Okay. But we're having
chocolate coconut
squares for dessert.

25:30.030 --> 25:31.031
Uh...

25:31.898 --> 25:33.466
Maybe later.

25:33.499 --> 25:35.135
All right, sweetie.

25:36.670 --> 25:38.004
HAROLD: Of course.

25:38.038 --> 25:39.272
He's at that stage.

25:39.305 --> 25:40.440
Yes, I understand
totally.

25:40.473 --> 25:41.608
All right. Good‐bye.

25:41.642 --> 25:43.109
You went through that.

25:43.143 --> 25:45.478
You wouldn't
eat a thing.

25:45.512 --> 25:48.615
That was Mr. Kowchevski
on the phone.

25:49.716 --> 25:51.752
Apparently, my daughter
is now a cheater.

25:51.785 --> 25:53.153
What?

25:53.186 --> 25:54.354
She cheated
on a math test.

25:54.387 --> 25:55.756
Now she's facing
suspension.

25:55.789 --> 25:58.091
My Aunt Sally.
Lindsay!

25:59.025 --> 26:00.326
It's not true.

26:00.360 --> 26:01.562
You're a good student.

26:01.595 --> 26:03.496
I don't understand
why you would cheat.

26:03.530 --> 26:05.365
Well, she's hanging around
with the wrong crowd.

26:05.398 --> 26:07.233
They're lying and cheating,
and, next thing you know,

26:07.267 --> 26:10.303
she's Patty Hearst,
and she's got a gun
to our head.

26:10.336 --> 26:11.872
Dad, I just told you
it's not true.

26:11.905 --> 26:13.740
Maybe I don't
believe you.

26:13.774 --> 26:16.209
You don't even ask me
my side of the story?

26:16.242 --> 26:19.580
You just jump to conclusions
and start yelling at me?

26:19.613 --> 26:21.615
God, that is so sick.

26:22.749 --> 26:24.284
You know... Fine.

26:24.317 --> 26:25.752
Believe what
you wanna believe.

26:25.786 --> 26:27.087
I don't even care.

26:27.120 --> 26:28.121
Whatever.

26:29.523 --> 26:31.625
You know, thanks
for all the support.

26:33.259 --> 26:34.628
(DOOR SLAMS)

26:36.262 --> 26:38.431
So then the guy
says to her,

26:38.464 --> 26:41.134
"How do you think
I rang the doorbell?"

26:41.167 --> 26:42.703
(LAUGHTER)

26:43.904 --> 26:45.872
It's a pretty good one, huh?

26:53.614 --> 26:55.215
Lindsay.

26:55.248 --> 26:56.717
I need to talk to you.

26:58.051 --> 27:00.621
Some of the mathletes
have been saying things.

27:00.654 --> 27:02.088
about you.

27:02.689 --> 27:04.625
Yeah? Like what?

27:04.658 --> 27:06.459
There's a rumor
going around

27:06.492 --> 27:07.994
that you cheated
on a math test.

27:08.028 --> 27:09.930
I told them
that's impossible.

27:09.963 --> 27:12.298
Even though Lindsay's
not a mathlete anymore,

27:12.332 --> 27:15.335
she would never break
the league's code of honor.

27:15.368 --> 27:17.070
Yeah? Well,
guess what, Millie?

27:17.638 --> 27:18.939
I did cheat.

27:19.740 --> 27:21.207
I lied
and I cheated,

27:21.241 --> 27:22.776
and then I lied
some more.

27:23.944 --> 27:26.680
(LAUGHING)

27:26.713 --> 27:29.616
You're funny, Lindsay.

27:29.650 --> 27:31.818
I knew it wasn't true.

27:45.666 --> 27:47.133
(SIGH)

27:49.970 --> 27:50.871
So...

27:50.904 --> 27:53.239
Anyone see
Dukes Of Hazzard
last night?

27:55.175 --> 27:56.176
Yeah.

27:57.177 --> 27:58.211
It was a good one.

28:00.647 --> 28:03.416
Yeah. Boss Hogg
is really funny.

28:11.792 --> 28:13.393
All right.
See you later, bye.

28:15.629 --> 28:16.930
Hey, Sam.

28:18.532 --> 28:21.401
Uh... What do you want?

28:22.435 --> 28:23.870
Um, well, I was
just wondering

28:23.904 --> 28:25.506
if you could
help me out with
the ice cream booth,

28:25.539 --> 28:27.240
'cause Betsy can't
make it to the carnival.

28:28.975 --> 28:33.179
Uh, well, it turns out that
I can't make it, either.

28:33.213 --> 28:34.414
Oh, that's too bad.

28:34.447 --> 28:37.250
Um, I'm a little busy
right now.

28:37.651 --> 28:38.819
So...

28:38.852 --> 28:40.286
Yeah, okay. Sure.

28:41.755 --> 28:43.724
Um, I'll see you
later.

28:49.162 --> 28:51.264
Wasn't that great
when the dukes

28:51.297 --> 28:55.235
handcuffed Roscoe,
Enos, and Boss Hogg
together?

28:57.738 --> 29:00.173
That was... really funny.

29:01.708 --> 29:02.909
Is there anything
you want to tell me

29:02.943 --> 29:04.778
before the meeting
this afternoon?

29:06.580 --> 29:07.781
It's just...

29:08.749 --> 29:10.116
I didn't cheat.

29:10.483 --> 29:11.484
You know...

29:12.519 --> 29:14.555
Something like this
happened to me

29:14.588 --> 29:16.156
when I was in high school.

29:16.189 --> 29:17.190
Got a minute?

29:18.058 --> 29:19.092
I guess.

29:21.294 --> 29:23.463
I felt bad
for this kid.

29:23.496 --> 29:25.031
Bruce Conforti.

29:25.065 --> 29:28.268
So I'd kinda help him
on biology tests.

29:29.169 --> 29:30.771
Okay, we cheated.

29:31.705 --> 29:33.139
But after a while,

29:33.173 --> 29:35.742
I realized he was the one
being cheated,

29:35.776 --> 29:37.277
out of something
priceless...

29:38.078 --> 29:39.112
Knowledge.

29:40.013 --> 29:42.649
So one day,
I just told him,

29:42.683 --> 29:44.184
I'm not gonna
do that anymore.

29:44.751 --> 29:45.886
And...

29:45.919 --> 29:48.655
He studied and he got
all A's on his own.

29:48.689 --> 29:51.992
Close. He beat
the living crap outta me.

29:54.360 --> 29:57.497
And when I say, beat
the living crap outta me,

29:57.531 --> 29:59.833
I mean, the living crap.

30:00.734 --> 30:03.136
All I did was
help Daniel study.

30:05.672 --> 30:09.042
Okay. I trust you.

30:17.317 --> 30:18.685
Hey, Kim.

30:18.719 --> 30:20.453
Where's Daniel?

30:20.486 --> 30:22.222
I don't know.
Beats me.

30:22.255 --> 30:24.390
We have a disciplinary
meeting after school.

30:24.424 --> 30:25.592
Ugh.

30:25.626 --> 30:26.827
You nervous?

30:27.794 --> 30:29.530
You know,
don't worry about it.

30:29.563 --> 30:32.165
Daniel gets out of
stuff like this
all the time.

30:34.668 --> 30:36.703
Well, I shouldn't
feel bad, right?

30:36.737 --> 30:38.471
I mean, Kowchevski
is a jerk,

30:38.505 --> 30:40.073
and I'm gonna
tutor Daniel,

30:40.106 --> 30:41.775
and he'll
pass the class.

30:41.808 --> 30:44.110
Everything's gonna
work out. Right?

30:44.444 --> 30:46.780
(LAUGHING)

30:46.813 --> 30:48.749
I'm sorry.

30:48.782 --> 30:50.350
You think that
you and Daniel

30:50.383 --> 30:52.418
are gonna be, like,
study buddies?

30:52.452 --> 30:53.520
He wants to learn.

30:53.554 --> 30:55.355
And what about
the next test?

30:55.388 --> 30:58.091
He'll just get the answers
from somebody else.

30:58.759 --> 31:00.093
He always does.

31:00.627 --> 31:01.895
Ah!

31:02.563 --> 31:04.130
Hey.
Hey.

31:04.164 --> 31:06.232
You ready to stick it
to the man?

31:06.733 --> 31:07.968
Partners in crime?

31:08.001 --> 31:09.302
Give me five.

31:11.071 --> 31:12.639
Hey, don't
leave me hangin'.

31:15.609 --> 31:16.877
All right.

31:20.246 --> 31:21.381
Ow!

31:25.586 --> 31:26.887
Hi.

31:26.920 --> 31:29.690
Another thing they do
is the old cop trick.

31:29.723 --> 31:30.991
They'll get you alone,

31:31.024 --> 31:32.859
and they'll tell you
I confessed.

31:32.893 --> 31:34.561
But don't believe 'em.

31:34.595 --> 31:36.429
I'll never confess, okay?

31:36.462 --> 31:38.031
Well, I'm going to.

31:38.732 --> 31:40.433
I can't keep lying.

31:40.466 --> 31:41.501
What? Why not?

31:41.535 --> 31:43.970
What is this, some kind
of game to you?

31:44.004 --> 31:45.739
You already
got me to cheat

31:45.772 --> 31:47.874
and to lie to my parents
and to Mr. Rosso.

31:47.908 --> 31:48.942
I mean...

31:48.975 --> 31:50.777
I know, but...
Why stop now?

31:50.811 --> 31:52.445
We're almost home free.

31:52.478 --> 31:55.481
All right. Lindsay.
Lindsay, I understand.

31:55.516 --> 31:58.484
You care about your grades
and your transcript.

31:59.820 --> 32:01.655
But if you get suspended,

32:01.688 --> 32:03.657
it goes on your transcript.

32:03.690 --> 32:05.325
Then you really
will be screwed.

32:07.493 --> 32:08.962
You're manipulating me.

32:09.295 --> 32:10.496
What?

32:10.531 --> 32:12.232
You're manipulating me.

32:12.265 --> 32:13.299
No, I'm not.

32:13.333 --> 32:14.434
Yes, you are.

32:14.467 --> 32:16.369
And, you know, it's really
hard to say no to you,

32:16.402 --> 32:19.239
but I have to.
I'm sorry. I can't go
in there and lie.

32:19.272 --> 32:20.874
I'm not going to.
Okay, fine.

32:20.907 --> 32:22.442
Don't lie.
What?

32:22.475 --> 32:25.411
No, let's go in there,
and we'll tell 'em
what we did.

32:25.445 --> 32:27.247
What's the difference?

32:27.280 --> 32:29.015
You'll get a nice
slap on the wrist,

32:29.049 --> 32:31.652
and I'll get, what,
suspended? Expelled?

32:31.685 --> 32:34.220
That is not
fair, Daniel.

32:34.254 --> 32:37.057
What do you think,
I want to be terrible
at school?

32:37.758 --> 32:39.159
You think I like it?

32:39.926 --> 32:41.161
I wish I was
as smart as you.

32:41.194 --> 32:43.229
I wish it all came
easy to me.

32:43.930 --> 32:45.331
But it doesn't.

32:47.000 --> 32:50.470
You know, when I was...
When I was in sixth grade,

32:50.504 --> 32:52.606
they told us
when we got
to junior high,

32:52.639 --> 32:56.743
we'd be either in
track one, track two,
or track three.

32:56.777 --> 32:58.311
Track one's
the smart kids,

32:58.344 --> 33:00.313
track two's
the normal kids,

33:00.346 --> 33:02.516
track three
is the dumb kids.

33:03.316 --> 33:04.651
And what do
you think I got?

33:08.088 --> 33:09.923
How do you think
it feels...

33:09.956 --> 33:11.625
to be told you're dumb...

33:12.759 --> 33:14.595
when you're
11 years old?

33:18.699 --> 33:20.233
You are not dumb.

33:23.003 --> 33:24.671
I just wanted
to prove him wrong.

33:25.639 --> 33:26.673
Just once.

33:29.175 --> 33:30.611
Even if I am cheating.

33:34.881 --> 33:36.216
"If a pregnant
woman has sex,

33:36.249 --> 33:38.251
can the baby get...
poked?"

33:40.053 --> 33:41.822
Hey. Hey. Hyenas!

33:41.855 --> 33:43.123
Can I get through
one question

33:43.156 --> 33:44.758
without you guys gettin'
hysterical on me?

33:44.791 --> 33:49.062
Come on. Uh... Listen,
sex is perfectly safe
for the fetus.

33:49.095 --> 33:50.496
It's, uh, it's not
gonna come out

33:50.531 --> 33:52.465
with dents on its head
like a golf ball
or somethin'.

33:52.498 --> 33:53.967
I mean, Dellage got
poked in the eye.

33:54.000 --> 33:56.069
(LAUGHTER)

33:56.102 --> 33:57.671
I'm kiddin'.
Kiddin', Dellage.

33:57.704 --> 33:59.740
(BELL RINGS)

33:59.773 --> 34:03.209
Listen. Chapter 13
in the text tomorrow
for a pop quiz.

34:03.243 --> 34:05.445
Whoop! You didn't
hear it from me.

34:05.478 --> 34:08.549
Hey, uh, Sam? Sam?
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

34:11.417 --> 34:12.519
In my office?

34:12.986 --> 34:14.287
Sure.

34:15.922 --> 34:17.791
When I was goin'
through these questions,

34:17.824 --> 34:19.760
I was a little
disturbed by yours.

34:21.261 --> 34:22.996
How did you know
which one was mine?

34:23.029 --> 34:27.267
I thought... I thought
it was anonymous.

34:27.300 --> 34:29.636
You're the only one
with Star Trek
notebook paper.

34:29.670 --> 34:31.104
Oh.

34:31.137 --> 34:34.140
Where'd you find out
about this... "Activity"?

34:35.008 --> 34:36.242
Uh...

34:39.479 --> 34:41.247
I saw a movie.

34:42.148 --> 34:44.585
Okay. I see. Um...

34:46.520 --> 34:47.554
Well, you know...

34:48.321 --> 34:50.356
In movies...
like that...

34:50.390 --> 34:53.527
They... They sensationalize
certain things...

34:54.060 --> 34:55.461
But in reality,

34:55.495 --> 34:57.497
those things
don't usually happen.

34:59.432 --> 35:01.234
You know what
I'm tryin' to say?

35:03.169 --> 35:05.405
All right. I'm gonna
tell you the truth.

35:05.438 --> 35:07.140
Plain language.
But listen,

35:07.173 --> 35:10.210
you can't tell anybody
we had this conversation.

35:10.243 --> 35:12.713
Your permission slip
for sex ed doesn't
cover this stuff.

35:12.746 --> 35:15.682
I could get in a lot
of trouble for what
I'm gonna tell you.

35:15.716 --> 35:16.783
All right?

35:18.752 --> 35:19.820
Okay.

35:20.453 --> 35:21.588
Fair enough.

35:23.557 --> 35:24.558
Um...

35:25.959 --> 35:28.361
Certain men...
Uh, not me...

35:30.130 --> 35:33.700
(NO AUDIO)

36:19.445 --> 36:22.448
Huh? Torture over.
We're done.

36:23.617 --> 36:25.886
But just... Just...
I mean,

36:25.919 --> 36:28.488
those movies...
It's not reality.

36:28.522 --> 36:30.991
Okay? If it was reality,
I'd be freaked out
myself.

36:31.024 --> 36:32.092
Okay?

36:32.125 --> 36:34.561
Yeah. Uh... Thank you,
Mr. Fredricks.

36:34.595 --> 36:35.596
No problem.

36:35.629 --> 36:37.397
All right.
Get outta here,
cowboy.

36:37.430 --> 36:40.867
Uh... I... I have
just one more question.

36:40.901 --> 36:42.002
What is it?

36:42.035 --> 36:43.937
Uh, could you explain
this joke to me?

36:43.970 --> 36:47.808
So, there's this guy
with no arms and no legs...

36:53.013 --> 36:54.280
Hey.

36:55.481 --> 36:57.584
If you want to tell
the truth, it's cool.

36:58.351 --> 36:59.520
Whatever you want.

36:59.553 --> 37:02.756
No. Daniel, let's
just stick to our story.

37:04.057 --> 37:05.258
Okay.

37:06.159 --> 37:07.828
When we get in there...

37:07.861 --> 37:09.329
let me handle it. Okay?

37:13.900 --> 37:17.270
Well, I'm cheesed
off right now,
and I don't care.

37:18.171 --> 37:19.873
Hi. We're
Lindsay Weir's
parents.

37:19.906 --> 37:21.407
Uh, Mom... Dad.

37:21.441 --> 37:22.809
What are you
doing here?

37:22.843 --> 37:24.678
Oh... Honey, we...

37:24.711 --> 37:27.648
We felt terrible
about last night.

37:27.681 --> 37:29.249
You've always been
truthful with us,

37:29.282 --> 37:31.251
so we never should've
doubted you.

37:31.284 --> 37:32.986
Nobody falsely
accuses my daughter!

37:33.019 --> 37:34.420
Honey. Shh.

37:35.155 --> 37:36.823
It's Okay. I mean,
it happens.

37:36.857 --> 37:38.224
Not to members
of this family,
it doesn't!

37:38.258 --> 37:39.960
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

37:39.993 --> 37:43.063
I want to give
this Kowchevski joker
a piece of my mind.

37:43.096 --> 37:45.465
JEAN: Your father
even closed the store.

37:47.534 --> 37:50.871
Now, let's be patient...
Try and hear
everyone out...

37:50.904 --> 37:54.074
Be a team.
We don't actually know
that anyone cheated.

37:54.107 --> 37:55.809
I do.

37:55.842 --> 37:59.279
Well, fine. Unfortunately,
an anonymous note
isn't sufficient proof.

37:59.312 --> 38:00.947
There was no note.

38:01.748 --> 38:02.583
There's no note?

38:02.616 --> 38:05.251
No. I use this
as a ploy sometimes

38:05.285 --> 38:06.787
to get a confession.

38:06.820 --> 38:08.955
How do you expect to have
real relationships
with these kids

38:08.989 --> 38:10.223
if you're lying to them?

38:10.256 --> 38:11.725
Let me tell you
something.

38:11.758 --> 38:14.595
I knew kids like
Desario in Vietnam.

38:14.628 --> 38:17.731
Those were
the kind of kids
that got you killed.

38:18.532 --> 38:20.634
(CHEERFULLY)
Everyone's here.

38:20.667 --> 38:23.203
And if she said
she didn't help
this kid cheat,

38:23.236 --> 38:24.304
then she didn't!

38:24.337 --> 38:25.739
She tutored him,
and it worked.

38:25.772 --> 38:27.407
Yeah. You shouldn't
be punishing her.
You should

38:27.440 --> 38:29.175
be paying her
for doing your job.

38:29.209 --> 38:32.445
Mr. Weir... Uh, Harold,
it's recently come
to my attention

38:32.478 --> 38:35.348
that there was
no anonymous note
written.

38:35.381 --> 38:36.883
There was no note?

38:36.917 --> 38:38.018
No. It was a fraud.

38:38.051 --> 38:39.753
I... I apologize.

38:39.786 --> 38:41.154
See? I told you.

38:41.187 --> 38:43.957
But we're still
not entirely convinced
these two didn't cheat.

38:43.990 --> 38:46.893
So you want to punish
my daughter, but you
have no proof.

38:46.927 --> 38:49.763
Look, Mr. Weir,
it should've never
come to this.

38:49.796 --> 38:52.833
I've talked to Lindsay.
I know she didn't
do anything.

38:52.866 --> 38:56.870
Daniel, did you...
cheat on this test?

38:56.903 --> 38:58.038
No.

38:58.071 --> 38:59.439
Good. Then
I'm satisfied.

38:59.472 --> 39:01.474
You're satisfied?
I'm not satisfied.

39:01.508 --> 39:02.809
Give it up, Frank.

39:02.843 --> 39:04.344
What is going on here?
I took off work
for this?

39:04.377 --> 39:06.079
I apologize for
the inconvenience.

39:06.112 --> 39:07.848
No, no, no.
Hold on a second.

39:07.881 --> 39:09.349
I've got an idea.

39:09.382 --> 39:12.285
I have
the Algebra test
that Daniel took.

39:12.318 --> 39:14.420
If he can do
the first problem,

39:14.454 --> 39:16.890
I will not only
get down on my
hands and knees

39:16.923 --> 39:19.793
and beg everyone
in this room
for forgiveness...

39:20.727 --> 39:21.962
But I'll quit.

39:21.995 --> 39:23.429
I will resign.

39:24.097 --> 39:25.866
I'll never teach
again.

39:25.899 --> 39:27.200
That'd be a start.

39:27.233 --> 39:30.136
I already took
the test. You can't
make me take it again.

39:30.170 --> 39:31.404
Yes, I can.

39:32.205 --> 39:34.107
Come on, Daniel.
One problem...

39:34.140 --> 39:36.376
and this all
goes away.

39:39.279 --> 39:40.413
Come on, son.

39:40.446 --> 39:41.982
ROSSO: Go ahead, Daniel.

39:49.823 --> 39:50.824
Okay.

39:53.760 --> 39:56.062
Just need to use
the quadratic formula.

40:01.167 --> 40:03.403
See? Look at him go.

40:18.251 --> 40:19.452
Hey, Sam.

40:20.386 --> 40:22.088
Oh. Hi, Cindy.

40:24.758 --> 40:27.427
I'm sorry
if I was acting...

40:27.460 --> 40:29.195
weird... at lunch.

40:30.130 --> 40:31.832
Were you acting weird?

40:31.865 --> 40:33.066
(CHUCKLES)

40:33.099 --> 40:34.768
Well... Anyways...

40:34.801 --> 40:38.404
Uh... It turns out
that I can go
to the carnival.

40:38.438 --> 40:39.973
So, I mean,
if you don't...

40:40.006 --> 40:42.876
If you still don't
have a scooper,
I'm available.

40:42.909 --> 40:45.111
Well, Jeanine already said
that she was gonna.

40:45.145 --> 40:46.346
Okay.

40:46.379 --> 40:49.215
But, hey, we can always
use another scooper.

40:49.249 --> 40:50.751
And, look. Grab a brush.

40:53.153 --> 40:54.154
Thank you.

40:58.391 --> 41:00.994
So, what time
should I be there?

41:01.027 --> 41:02.963
Well, I don't know.
It starts at, like, noon,

41:02.996 --> 41:04.831
so maybe you should
come at 11:00.

41:04.865 --> 41:06.066
A.M.?

41:06.099 --> 41:07.200
P.M.?

41:07.233 --> 41:08.869
(BOTH LAUGH)

41:10.336 --> 41:11.371
CINDY: 12 noon.

41:11.404 --> 41:12.739
Nooo...

41:12.773 --> 41:13.940
Sam...

41:13.974 --> 41:14.808
(JEAN WHISPERS)

41:14.841 --> 41:16.442
SAM: (WHISPERING)
No, I know.

41:16.476 --> 41:18.144
He's got a problem,
that's all.

41:25.619 --> 41:27.020
What is that?

41:28.755 --> 41:32.458
That... is a student
that Mr. Rosso
believes in.

41:32.492 --> 41:35.261
Uh, Led Zeppelin
is actually the name

41:35.295 --> 41:36.329
of a popular
rock band.

41:36.362 --> 41:38.331
I know who
Led Zeppelin is!

41:38.364 --> 41:39.733
What the hell's
goin' on here?

41:39.766 --> 41:41.001
Are you kidding us
with this crap?

41:41.034 --> 41:42.869
Lindsay, you lied to us?
Mom, I didn't...

41:42.903 --> 41:44.571
Do you have any idea
how much money
I'm losing?

41:44.605 --> 41:46.272
Look, don't blame
Lindsay.

41:48.208 --> 41:49.743
It's not her fault.

41:50.911 --> 41:52.378
It's mine.

41:52.412 --> 41:55.949
She was just tryin'
to help me. Nobody
else ever does.

41:55.982 --> 41:58.652
What do you think,
I want to be
terrible at school?

41:58.685 --> 42:00.120
You think I like it?

42:01.354 --> 42:04.390
I wish I was smart,
you know? I wish it all
came easy to me,

42:04.424 --> 42:05.626
but it doesn't.

42:06.627 --> 42:09.429
You know, when I was
in sixth grade,

42:09.462 --> 42:11.031
they told us when
we got to junior high,

42:11.064 --> 42:14.701
we'd be either in
track one, track two,
or track three.

42:14.735 --> 42:16.603
Track one's
the smart kids.

42:16.637 --> 42:18.505
Track two's
the normal kids.

42:18.539 --> 42:20.206
Track three's
the dumb kids.

42:21.875 --> 42:23.710
And what do you
think I got?

42:24.778 --> 42:27.681
How do you think
it feels to be told
that you're dumb

42:27.714 --> 42:29.983
in ink when you're
11 years old?

42:33.987 --> 42:36.857
I mean... Where
are you supposed
to go from there?

42:44.497 --> 42:46.867
Ha ha ha ha ha!

42:50.671 --> 42:53.039
(STILL LAUGHING)

42:55.375 --> 42:56.643
Be cool.

42:59.646 --> 43:01.314
Look. She's as high
as a kite!

43:02.315 --> 43:03.517
My daughter
is not high!

43:03.550 --> 43:04.985
Harold,
what is going on?

43:05.018 --> 43:06.753
I... I thinks it's
a nervous reaction.

43:06.787 --> 43:08.522
HAROLD: I don't
know what's happening.

43:08.555 --> 43:09.990
Tense situation.
I don't...

43:10.023 --> 43:12.959
Ha ha ha ha ha!

43:12.993 --> 43:15.295
JEAN: She's in...
Track three!

43:15.328 --> 43:16.797
Lindsay,
what's going on?!

43:16.830 --> 43:18.865
