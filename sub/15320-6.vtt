37:40.884 --> 37:44.877
I gotta get outta here.
Can’t take it anymore, you know?

37:45.973 --> 37:48.009
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

37:49.101 --> 37:50.716
[ Rings]

37:51.812 --> 37:53.427
[ Rings]

37:54.356 --> 37:55.971
[ Rings]

37:56.859 --> 37:59.020
[ Rings]

37:59.027 --> 38:03.691
Now in contrast,
I’ve shown a commitment
to jobs and infrastructure,

38:03.699 --> 38:06.657
and it’s precisely those policies
which have Seattle...

38:06.660 --> 38:09.697
weathering this country’s
current recession better
than the rest of the nation.

38:09.705 --> 38:11.866
I don’t think we should be
satisfied with better.

38:11.874 --> 38:14.741
I don’t think
8.7% unemployment is better.

38:14.752 --> 38:17.835
I don’t think a 12% increase
in crime is better.

38:17.838 --> 38:21.080
We’ve yet to hear
a specific program or policy
from you though, Councilman.

38:21.091 --> 38:25.676
For instance, your approach
to the problem of gang violence.

38:25.679 --> 38:30.173
Community improvements under
the aegis of green development.
Police outreach—

38:30.184 --> 38:34.348
Describing a vague dream
of a perfect world doesn’t
quite answer the question.

38:34.354 --> 38:37.596
“In dreams begin responsibilities.”

38:37.608 --> 38:39.849
Those are wise words, Mr. Mayor.

38:41.320 --> 38:45.233
The dream of a better world,
the dream of a better self.

38:45.240 --> 38:48.607
These are the ambitions
behind my campaign’s programs.

38:48.619 --> 38:52.237
Uh, the community investment
and sustainable jobs initiatives.

38:52.247 --> 38:53.987
You know, from time to time,

38:53.999 --> 38:58.242
we forget who we are
and why we do what we do.

38:58.253 --> 39:03.748
That’s why we have elections:
To redefine where we’re all going together.

39:03.759 --> 39:07.377
We define
our dreams together.

39:07.387 --> 39:10.515
And it does not seem naive
to me to want more,

39:10.516 --> 39:14.259
to reach out for more than
the mayor’s corporate status quo.

39:47.344 --> 39:49.585
l-l think you just missed the exit.

39:53.600 --> 39:55.306
Mr. Larsen.

40:05.195 --> 40:07.607
When you coddle
the violent criminal,

40:07.614 --> 40:11.232
you approve the commission
of crime, and-and you let them
loose again...

40:11.243 --> 40:14.451
amongst our communities,
our children.

40:14.454 --> 40:17.070
And again, I need to point out,

40:17.082 --> 40:22.122
we see no concrete, viable alternative
offered from the councilman.

40:22.129 --> 40:23.960
Councilman Richmond?

40:25.966 --> 40:28.582
Actually,
I have the perfect example...

40:28.594 --> 40:33.554
of the kind of initiative that the mayor
has been disparaging all evening.

40:33.557 --> 40:36.219
It is a community
education program.

40:36.226 --> 40:39.263
And every neighborhood
that’s hosted it,
every school we’ve gone into...

40:39.271 --> 40:43.355
has witnessed not
only significant decreases
in gang activity...

40:43.358 --> 40:45.565
but increases
in graduation rates.

40:45.736 --> 40:49.604
Which program
are you referring to?
A program I am very proud of.

40:49.615 --> 40:51.355
It’s called Seattle All Stars,

40:51.366 --> 40:53.482
and it’s been
an unqualified success.

40:53.493 --> 40:56.075
This is what I mean
aboutcoddHng.

40:56.079 --> 40:59.913
Isn’t it true that one
of your leading mentors
in that program...

40:59.917 --> 41:01.873
is the chief suspect
in the Rosie Larsen murder?

41:01.877 --> 41:05.790
It is ridiculous to consider
that a man who has not been
charged with a thing—

41:05.964 --> 41:08.671
Councilman, is this true?
No one has been arrested.

41:08.675 --> 41:12.088
We have a thing called
due process in this country,
and it works.

41:12.095 --> 41:14.177
I can’t help
that your sympathies
are misplaced, Councilman.

41:14.181 --> 41:16.342
This debate is not about
the Rosie Larsen case.

41:16.350 --> 41:20.013
It seems pretty relevant to me.
I think violent criminals
should go to prison.

41:20.020 --> 41:22.682
The councilman wants
to protect their reputations.

41:22.689 --> 41:25.681
You’re done, son.
The state of Washington is off-limits.

41:25.692 --> 41:29.731
So pack your bags,
’cause in two weeks,
your little career flames out.

41:29.738 --> 41:34.357
[ Richmond ] I will say again,
the man is not a suspect.
He is a person of interest.

41:42.626 --> 41:44.332
ls Bennet Ahmed here?

41:47.130 --> 41:50.372
The teacher? He left.
Everybody left.

41:50.384 --> 41:52.500
When did he leave,
Mrs. Larsen?

41:52.511 --> 41:54.593
He got a ride home
with Stan.

41:56.264 --> 41:59.756
Stay here.
I’ll follow the route back to Ahmed’s.
And keep calling him.

42:01.353 --> 42:03.218
