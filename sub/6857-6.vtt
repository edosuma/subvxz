00:16.797 --> 00:18.175
<i>The final surge.</i>

00:18.442 --> 00:21.417
<i>Having learned of warlord Poggle
the Lesser's plot to rebuild</i>

00:21.585 --> 00:23.799
<i>a separatist droid foundry
on Geonosis,</i>

00:23.924 --> 00:27.215
<i>Jedi knight Anakin Skywalker
and his Padawan Ahsoka Tano</i>

00:27.340 --> 00:30.335
<i>prepare to assault
this heavily-fortified installation.</i>

00:30.845 --> 00:32.219
<i>Their mission:</i>

00:32.430 --> 00:34.141
<i>destroy the factory at all cost.</i>

00:34.463 --> 00:36.396
<i>Anticipating stiff resistance,</i>

00:36.521 --> 00:39.515
<i>Republic commanders send
Jedi Master Luminara Unduli</i>

00:39.640 --> 00:43.044
<i>and her Padawan Barriss Offee
to reinforce the attack.</i>

00:43.566 --> 00:46.036
<i>But time runs short
for our intrepid heroes</i>

00:46.161 --> 00:48.820
<i>as the dreaded droid mill
nears completion.</i>

00:51.515 --> 00:52.369
Captain,

00:52.561 --> 00:55.910
the only safe landing zone is south
of Skywalker's position.

00:58.747 --> 01:02.047
Barriss, I assume you've made
the necessary preparations?

01:02.371 --> 01:04.453
Precisely as you instructed, Master.

01:05.421 --> 01:07.617
Buckle your belts
and check your cells, soldiers.

01:07.742 --> 01:08.915
We're going in.

01:22.286 --> 01:24.355
This bridge is our first waypoint.

01:24.633 --> 01:27.942
Focus your fire on the gun emplacements
here and here...

01:28.111 --> 01:30.246
Because it's only after
we neutralize the guns

01:30.371 --> 01:32.999
- that we can push for the factory.
- I was...

01:34.408 --> 01:35.950
We can push for the factory.

01:36.118 --> 01:37.842
Now, expect stiff resistance from...

01:37.967 --> 01:40.817
And don't forget to top off
your energy cells and ration packs.

01:40.942 --> 01:43.041
Once we leave,
there will be no resupply.

01:43.662 --> 01:45.543
Anything else, Ahsoka?

01:45.711 --> 01:47.907
I think you've pretty much
covered everything...

01:48.032 --> 01:49.631
In my briefing.

01:50.215 --> 01:52.133
Very well.
Squad dismissed.

01:56.133 --> 01:58.201
- What's next?
- Master,

01:58.326 --> 02:00.160
my briefings might go better

02:00.285 --> 02:03.353
if you didn't interrupt me
every time I try to...

02:03.521 --> 02:05.396
I wasn't.
I was trying to help you.

02:05.564 --> 02:09.517
Which I would appreciate
if you didn't interrupt me to do it.

02:09.949 --> 02:12.570
I just think maybe you don't trust me
to give the briefing.

02:12.739 --> 02:15.831
It's not about trust.
It's about getting the job done right.

02:15.956 --> 02:18.880
So you don't trust me to get
the job done right. I knew it.

02:19.419 --> 02:20.935
Snips, I never said...

02:21.545 --> 02:23.122
No, it's okay.
I understand.

02:23.247 --> 02:25.662
I'm the Padawan.
You're the Master.

02:32.417 --> 02:35.011
Good day, General.
Skywalker's waiting for you.

02:37.764 --> 02:40.515
- At it again, are they?
- "Again," Master?

02:40.683 --> 02:42.977
Let's just say
that they have a penchant

02:43.102 --> 02:46.183
for playing loose with regulations
and rules of command.

02:46.968 --> 02:50.293
If you don't trust me,
then maybe you should send me back.

02:51.076 --> 02:52.722
Don't tempt me, snips.

02:52.976 --> 02:55.212
If you're both finished
with your little discussion,

02:55.337 --> 02:57.378
we do have a factory to destroy.

02:59.009 --> 03:01.875
Well, Barriss,
aren't you going to introduce yourself?

03:02.149 --> 03:04.789
Padawan learner Barriss
Offee at your service.

03:09.871 --> 03:12.064
Glad to meet you.
I'm Ahsoka.

03:15.132 --> 03:16.843
It's good to see both of you again.

03:17.286 --> 03:20.104
I wish it was under
more peaceful circumstances.

03:29.356 --> 03:32.391
A frontal assault is risky.
Our losses will be high.

03:32.640 --> 03:35.238
But not as high as they'll be
if that factory comes online.

03:35.363 --> 03:37.626
Indeed, but there is an alternative.

03:38.561 --> 03:41.349
Every Geonosian building
has a series of catacombs

03:41.474 --> 03:43.388
beneath it
that run deep underground.

03:43.513 --> 03:46.320
Some of the tunnels are close enough
to this cliff wall

03:46.445 --> 03:49.064
so that you could cut a hole
and make an entry point.

03:49.189 --> 03:51.502
Once inside,
we could find the main reactor,

03:51.627 --> 03:54.800
plant the explosives,
and blow the factory inside out.

03:55.007 --> 03:57.592
Looks like a good way to get lost,
if you ask me.

03:57.760 --> 04:00.755
For the unprepared perhaps,
but I have instructed Barriss

04:00.880 --> 04:04.098
to memorize the labyrinth,
all 200 junctions.

04:04.451 --> 04:06.058
You always were thorough.

04:06.480 --> 04:09.237
It pays for one to be prepared.
Right, Barriss?

04:09.522 --> 04:12.648
Especially when other people's lives
depend on your success.

04:12.816 --> 04:15.300
How do we keep
the Geonosians occupied

04:15.425 --> 04:17.361
while someone else
is setting the bombs?

04:17.529 --> 04:18.641
Good point, snips.

04:18.766 --> 04:20.865
If whoever's going in there
is going to be successful,

04:20.990 --> 04:23.246
- we'll need to create a diversion.
- Precisely.

04:23.504 --> 04:26.577
That task will be carried out
by you and I,

04:26.702 --> 04:29.811
while the destruction of the factory
falls to the Padawans.

04:29.936 --> 04:31.959
Now, hold on.
Who decided that?

04:32.127 --> 04:34.086
Walking into
that factory could be suicide.

04:34.255 --> 04:37.504
Not if you and I are successful holding
poggle's attention at the bridge.

04:38.008 --> 04:41.367
Master, I can do this.
I've had riskier assignments.

04:41.492 --> 04:44.462
But unlike Barriss
you aren't prepared for this mission.

04:44.735 --> 04:45.765
Not to worry.

04:45.933 --> 04:47.603
My Padawan is reliable.

04:47.923 --> 04:49.705
She can lead them both.

04:49.830 --> 04:51.397
We'll be in and out, Master.

04:51.980 --> 04:54.974
See?
Dependable Barriss will get us through.

04:55.247 --> 04:56.530
Don't worry, Master.

04:56.655 --> 04:59.286
As you well know,
I can follow orders.

04:59.738 --> 05:01.123
It's decided then.

05:02.741 --> 05:04.003
I guess it is.

05:04.410 --> 05:07.104
We'll monitor your progress
on these chronometers.

05:07.229 --> 05:08.621
Synchronize on my mark.

05:09.192 --> 05:10.737
Three, two,

05:11.203 --> 05:12.030
one,

05:12.287 --> 05:13.087
mark.

05:15.660 --> 05:18.010
Let's get going.
After you, Barriss.

05:27.380 --> 05:29.433
You feel Ahsoka's not up
to the task.

05:30.006 --> 05:31.185
I never said that.

05:31.353 --> 05:32.395
What is it, then?

05:33.205 --> 05:35.386
Nothing.
Let's prepare the men.

05:39.988 --> 05:43.295
We'll have to make a bold move
if we're to draw them out of the factory

05:43.420 --> 05:46.534
and keep their attention on us
and not the Padawans.

05:46.702 --> 05:49.324
The best way to that is to march
our troops straight up the middle,

05:49.449 --> 05:51.998
parade style.
They can't resist that.

05:52.166 --> 05:53.366
With no cover?

05:53.714 --> 05:55.614
We have to make it tempting.

05:59.607 --> 06:02.812
The factory is operating
at 50% production capacity.

06:02.937 --> 06:06.037
We have 10 garrisons of new droids
ready to deploy.

06:08.974 --> 06:11.147
No, the super tanks are not ready,

06:11.272 --> 06:14.136
but when they are,
the Republic forces will be routed.

06:14.261 --> 06:17.223
They have no weapon
that can penetrate its heavy armor.

06:28.468 --> 06:31.103
Here come the droids.
Everybody steady.

06:31.369 --> 06:33.397
Steady.
Keep marching.

06:33.961 --> 06:37.376
I hope the Padawans have made it
past the bridge by now.

06:49.640 --> 06:51.740
That looks like a lot of droids.

06:51.938 --> 06:54.030
Well, it is a droid factory.

06:54.381 --> 06:57.016
As long as we can destroy 'em faster
than they can make 'em,

06:57.141 --> 06:58.741
we'll come out on top.

06:59.132 --> 07:01.315
I love your simple logic, Skywalker.

07:01.440 --> 07:02.490
Here we go.

07:10.258 --> 07:12.187
<i>Let them fall into the trap.</i>

07:23.633 --> 07:25.533
<i>You may now commence attack.</i>

08:01.699 --> 08:02.699
Nice work.

08:04.227 --> 08:06.590
- Here goes nothing.
- I should go in first.

08:06.758 --> 08:08.008
I know the way.

08:08.691 --> 08:09.791
Be my guest.

08:48.440 --> 08:49.508
They're sleeping.

08:49.676 --> 08:51.486
We have to find another way.

08:51.611 --> 08:52.993
We don't have time.

08:53.118 --> 08:54.662
This direction is the fastest.

08:54.787 --> 08:56.987
- Maybe you're wrong.
- Trust me.

09:43.658 --> 09:45.856
They should have entered
the catacombs by now.

09:46.024 --> 09:48.109
I sure hope
they're not lost down there.

09:49.606 --> 09:51.406
Left at the next junction.

09:55.625 --> 09:56.625
Dead end.

09:56.750 --> 09:59.974
If we make a wrong turn,
we may never find our way out.

10:00.410 --> 10:02.560
You do remember the way, don't you?

10:03.059 --> 10:04.309
Of course I do.

10:07.918 --> 10:09.715
It's not left, it's up.

10:11.707 --> 10:12.896
It's this way.

10:30.152 --> 10:33.252
- Rex, a little help here.
- Get up there, trooper.

10:46.375 --> 10:49.879
My lord, I beg you to let us use
the secret weapons.

10:52.050 --> 10:55.597
We have 20 units ready now
and many more on the way.

11:02.290 --> 11:04.894
Deploy the super tanks.
Attack formation.

11:16.531 --> 11:18.626
Looks like the Separatists
have a new toy.

11:18.751 --> 11:20.401
Rex, pick your targets.

11:21.495 --> 11:23.245
Elevation four-two-seven.

11:35.129 --> 11:36.779
That's a lot of droids.

11:38.766 --> 11:41.305
Come on.
The main control room is this way.

11:46.812 --> 11:47.728
Steady.

11:48.635 --> 11:49.647
Steady.

11:50.038 --> 11:51.038
Fire!

12:03.662 --> 12:06.803
Our shields are holding.
They can't touch us.

12:06.928 --> 12:08.207
That's a relief.

12:11.378 --> 12:13.504
Sir, nothing could withstand that.

12:13.672 --> 12:15.005
They must be ray-shielded.

12:17.653 --> 12:19.353
This is it.
We're here.

12:32.213 --> 12:35.401
Two Jedi in the control room?
That is impossible.

12:35.526 --> 12:38.076
How could they have gotten
past security?

12:41.607 --> 12:44.090
And now we make ourselves scarce.

12:55.365 --> 12:56.338
Green light.

12:56.616 --> 12:57.881
The bombs are active.

12:58.389 --> 13:01.039
- The Padawans did it.
- And just in time.

13:03.607 --> 13:04.513
Fire!

13:06.371 --> 13:07.433
Get down!

13:25.475 --> 13:26.815
You heard his highness.

13:26.940 --> 13:30.247
Collect their pathetic little bombs,
then we will kill them.

13:40.058 --> 13:42.073
See if your stupid tank
can take this.

13:44.127 --> 13:46.847
Fool, the super tank is impervious
to all weapons...

14:12.972 --> 14:15.373
Rex, tell the men to fall back.

14:15.835 --> 14:19.075
But, sir, you can't be asking us
to turn tail and run?

14:19.243 --> 14:20.897
I'm not asking you to run, Rex.

14:21.022 --> 14:24.051
I want to draw
those tanks out onto the bridge.

14:24.220 --> 14:25.928
I see what you have in mind.

14:26.097 --> 14:28.015
I always come prepared, Master.

14:28.140 --> 14:29.140
Let's go.

14:34.438 --> 14:35.438
The bombs!

14:46.491 --> 14:47.991
Stupid green bugger!

15:07.804 --> 15:09.354
Fall back! Fall back!

15:43.731 --> 15:45.465
Give everything you've got.

16:08.429 --> 16:09.531
Roger, roger.

16:24.813 --> 16:25.949
Where are they?

16:26.074 --> 16:28.342
Those bombs are going
to go off any second now.

16:28.511 --> 16:31.303
Rex, any sign of Ahsoka
or Barriss on your side?

16:31.472 --> 16:33.837
No, sir,
but this place is getting ready to blow.

16:33.962 --> 16:37.226
The evacuation ships are arriving.
I suggest you get on one.

16:37.395 --> 16:38.845
Not without Ahsoka.

16:39.187 --> 16:40.952
My Padawan will not fail.

16:41.482 --> 16:43.182
Ahsoka, can you hear me?

16:43.307 --> 16:44.775
Ahsoka, where are you?

16:57.900 --> 16:59.150
Where'd she go?

17:09.903 --> 17:12.678
- The bugs took the bombs.
- What are we going to do now?

17:12.846 --> 17:15.347
I don't know what to do
without the bombs.

17:16.894 --> 17:19.594
This tank could destroy
the power generator

17:20.147 --> 17:22.147
and probably us along with it.

17:23.189 --> 17:25.239
I guess that's our only choice.

17:26.564 --> 17:28.263
Master, can you hear me?

17:31.193 --> 17:33.156
Set off the bombs!
We're trapped.

17:33.430 --> 17:34.830
I'm sorry, Master.

17:35.114 --> 17:37.808
<i>- We can't make it out.
- Can't make it out?</i>

17:37.933 --> 17:40.080
<i>- Ahsoka, wait!
- Fire.</i>

18:00.528 --> 18:02.571
Get down. Get down!

18:16.895 --> 18:19.328
Ahsoka, can you hear me?
Come in.

18:21.166 --> 18:22.998
Master Luminara, don't worry.

18:23.167 --> 18:24.767
Be at ease, Skywalker.

18:25.294 --> 18:27.391
At ease? We need to act now.

18:27.656 --> 18:30.005
Ahsoka and Barriss
may still be alive down there.

18:30.464 --> 18:32.164
There's not enough time.

18:32.398 --> 18:34.217
I sense them drifting away.

18:34.456 --> 18:36.106
No, we'll get them out.

18:44.779 --> 18:47.397
The tank lifters are here to move
the debris as ordered.

18:47.565 --> 18:48.815
Get to it, Rex.

18:58.168 --> 19:00.102
How deep do you think we're buried?

19:00.227 --> 19:02.827
It's probably best
not to think about it.

19:03.577 --> 19:05.540
Hand me that power cell, would you?

19:08.634 --> 19:10.712
Thanks.
Mind holding the light?

19:10.880 --> 19:13.429
Whatever you're doing,
I hope it works, because...

19:13.554 --> 19:15.504
I'd sure rather have died
fighting up there

19:15.629 --> 19:18.387
- than starve to death down here.
- Don't worry.

19:18.512 --> 19:21.139
We'll run out of air
long before we starve.

19:21.424 --> 19:23.724
That's a comforting thought. Thanks.

19:24.436 --> 19:26.867
Master Skywalker
has taught me a trick or two.

19:26.992 --> 19:27.969
I think

19:28.432 --> 19:30.732
I can get this communicator working.

19:37.407 --> 19:39.457
We cannot abandon our Padawans.

19:39.728 --> 19:41.028
You misjudge me.

19:41.802 --> 19:43.752
I too care for my apprentice,

19:44.540 --> 19:46.164
but if their time has come...

19:46.333 --> 19:48.183
I refuse to let Ahsoka die.

19:48.622 --> 19:50.322
She will find a way out.

19:50.911 --> 19:52.761
If my Padawan has perished,

19:53.119 --> 19:54.469
I will mourn her,

19:54.647 --> 19:57.342
but I will celebrate her
as well through her memory.

19:57.510 --> 20:00.860
I still plan on celebrating
this victory with my Padawan

20:01.140 --> 20:02.140
in person.

20:03.127 --> 20:05.500
What happens to us now
doesn't matter.

20:05.625 --> 20:09.475
By destroying this factory,
we've saved countless lives elsewhere.

20:10.434 --> 20:12.284
I'm about to save two more.

20:19.225 --> 20:20.038
Wait.

20:20.163 --> 20:22.701
I'm picking up a pulse
on Ahsoka's comm channel.

20:22.870 --> 20:24.453
It's coming from over there.

20:26.284 --> 20:28.026
I know you're up there,

20:28.151 --> 20:30.301
and I know you're looking for me.

20:39.320 --> 20:42.270
- I'll move the heavy machinery over.
- No time.

20:54.546 --> 20:55.942
Someone's digging.

21:15.881 --> 21:19.192
I knew they were still alive.
I told you not to give up on them.

21:19.317 --> 21:22.417
It's not that I gave up,
Skywalker, but unlike you,

21:22.563 --> 21:26.207
when the time comes,
I am prepared to let my student go.

21:26.971 --> 21:28.521
Can you say the same?

21:33.047 --> 21:35.197
I knew you'd come looking for me.

21:35.666 --> 21:37.816
I never doubted you for a second.

21:38.476 --> 21:39.971
Padawan, you did well.

21:40.096 --> 21:41.496
Thank you, Master,

21:41.726 --> 21:44.825
but if it weren't for Ahsoka,
we'd still be down there.

21:45.730 --> 21:46.730
Indeed.

21:47.337 --> 21:49.637
Your Master never lost faith in you.
