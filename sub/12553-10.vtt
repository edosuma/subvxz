This is a time window.

Is this Buckingham Palace?

00:41.941 --> 00:43.143
'Tis the Tower of London.

-What you looking at?
-Germans.

00:44.477 --> 00:46.479
-I see it, you're right.
-I'm not a spirit.

Ta-da!

junk shop bloke's after.

00:51.985 --> 00:53.553
It's coming from in there.

00:53.620 --> 00:54.888
If Sarah Jane and her friends
do not return soon,

00:54.954 --> 00:56.489
they'll be trapped
in the past!

It's over now. It's all over.

01:54.380 --> 01:56.483
But why did it stop
so suddenly?

01:58.218 --> 02:02.922
I guess because that's where
it ends for those children.

02:42.495 --> 02:43.530
Are you all right?

02:44.264 --> 02:45.465
I am fine, thank you.

02:46.466 --> 02:47.901
And you have just
saved my life.

02:47.967 --> 02:49.736
What is all this commotion?

02:49.802 --> 02:52.372
Matilda just tried
to kill Lady Jane.

02:52.438 --> 02:55.608
-A treacherous Catholic?
-I am no Catholic.

02:55.675 --> 02:56.876
I am a Protestant.

02:58.244 --> 03:00.613
One of my own? Then why?

03:00.680 --> 03:05.018
Your death would have
inspired thousands
to rise up against Mary.

03:05.084 --> 03:06.886
And now she will
simply lock you up.

03:07.720 --> 03:10.657
Then, one day,

03:10.723 --> 03:13.860
she will have you
quietly executed,

03:13.927 --> 03:15.728
when you could have
died a martyr.

03:21.100 --> 03:23.136
That's it!

03:23.202 --> 03:24.938
The object that's
changing history.

03:27.941 --> 03:31.177
But you weren't supposed
to die tonight. I saved you.

03:32.779 --> 03:34.414
That's what I was
sent here to do.

03:34.480 --> 03:36.983
Lady Jane has not been saved.

03:37.050 --> 03:39.319
You have condemned her to die,

03:39.385 --> 03:40.753
like a common traitor.

03:40.820 --> 03:42.722
Forgotten and alone.

03:45.425 --> 03:48.661
It brought it all back to me,
hearing those children.

03:48.728 --> 03:50.897
It must have been
like that for Mother.

03:50.964 --> 03:52.432
I know what you
went through, Emily,

03:52.498 --> 03:53.900
I know what
you're going through.

03:53.967 --> 03:55.969
I lost both my parents
when I was very young.

03:56.035 --> 03:59.105
You understand then,
that if I found ghosts here,

03:59.172 --> 04:01.608
I'd know also that Mother
was out there somewhere.

04:01.674 --> 04:03.876
Yes, but you have to live
in the here and now.

04:03.943 --> 04:06.312
Oh, you're lucky,
because there's someone here
and now, who loves you.

04:06.379 --> 04:07.447
Your father.

04:07.513 --> 04:09.616
I know. (CHUCKLES)
The here and now.

04:10.917 --> 04:12.919
But we must help
those children.

04:12.986 --> 04:16.055
I couldn't save Mother,
but there's got to be some
way we can save them.

04:16.122 --> 04:18.024
Trouble is, it's all over now.

04:18.091 --> 04:20.927
But remember, it happens
every night at 8:00.

04:21.894 --> 04:23.463
We'll have to come
back tomorrow.

04:24.697 --> 04:26.132
Not necessarily.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.935

isn't it?

04:51.057 --> 04:53.760
It has to. We can't help those
children unless we understand.

Look, Sarah Jane, you did it!

05:07.740 --> 05:09.575
We can see her now!

05:09.642 --> 05:11.377
See you about 11:30?

05:11.444 --> 05:13.846
The echoes of the future
must be getting stronger.

05:15.048 --> 05:17.784
Hello? Can you hear me?

05:29.195 --> 05:31.731
I've really got to get back
to the church though,
I need that hammer.

05:31.798 --> 05:33.599
Why is that thing
so important to you?

05:33.666 --> 05:35.968
Anyway, you can get it
when the Home Guard
nobble the Jerries.

05:36.035 --> 05:37.370
(GASPING)

05:37.437 --> 05:39.906

-George?
-Well, am I glad
to see you, miss.

05:42.809 --> 05:44.711
Three Germans!
At the church!

05:44.777 --> 05:46.079
Who's this?

05:46.145 --> 05:47.447
Miss Wyckham,
our school teacher,

05:47.513 --> 05:49.348
they held us hostage
but we escaped.

05:49.415 --> 05:50.950
We've got to inform
the Home Guard.

05:51.017 --> 05:52.185
Well, they've been
captured, too.

05:52.251 --> 05:53.352
And the whole
of Little Malding!

05:53.419 --> 05:55.088
Really? Everyone
in the village?

05:55.154 --> 05:57.256
-How many Germans
are there, then?
-Dozens.

05:57.323 --> 05:59.258
The place is surrounded,
but I managed to slip through.

05:59.325 --> 06:00.793
We can't go anywhere
near the village.

06:00.860 --> 06:02.128
Then what now?

06:02.195 --> 06:03.596
We must all go back
to St Michael's.

06:03.663 --> 06:05.598
She's right.

06:05.665 --> 06:08.301
We're the only ones who
can stop the Nazis now
and their radio thingy.

06:08.367 --> 06:10.636
But they're all armed,
remember?

06:10.703 --> 06:12.772
Yes, George, and so are we.

You're not alone,

06:39.365 --> 06:40.833
You have me.

06:43.569 --> 06:45.271
Has Lady Matilda been secured?

06:45.338 --> 06:48.174
Yes, Jane, but so have we.

The palace is surrounded
by Mary's guards.

the end is not far off.

06:56.682 --> 06:58.117

06:58.184 --> 07:01.888
Can't we tell them,
tell Mary that you were used?

07:01.954 --> 07:03.823
You didn't want to be queen!

07:03.890 --> 07:06.626
I fear Mary still sees
Jane as a threat.

07:06.692 --> 07:09.662
If she is to restore
the Catholic faith,

07:09.729 --> 07:12.198
she will not want Jane
fuelling the Protestant cause.

here to be crowned
that I would not leave.

to our aircraft and ships.

12:44.497 --> 12:48.167
But we can render
the entire system useless
with our Sieg transmitter.

12:48.234 --> 12:50.336
So that thing blocks
British radar?

12:50.402 --> 12:53.772
Right now, the glorious
German fleet is preparing
to depart harbours

12:53.839 --> 12:56.275
all along the Dutch
and Belgian coast.

12:56.342 --> 13:01.814

Intelligence will not suspect
until it is far too late.

13:01.881 --> 13:04.350

Clyde and me.

13:04.416 --> 13:07.086
And what can two
schoolboys do?

13:09.255 --> 13:10.489
You'd be surprised.

13:11.857 --> 13:14.527
I've taken on bigger
loonies than you lot.

13:14.593 --> 13:17.229
I've fought hideous,
bug-eyed monsters.

with this!

What is that?

13:23.435 --> 13:25.538
Oh, this? This is a bomb.

13:25.604 --> 13:29.775
A very small bomb,
but powerful enough
to blast this entire church.

He's bluffing. It can't be.

to take that chance?

-I've got it!

-Give that to me!

every step of the way.

lots of lives,

we'll crush you lot.

14:50.055 --> 14:53.158
It's got to be
what The Shopkeeper was after.

14:53.225 --> 14:55.461
So he must have sent me
to the wrong time.

14:55.527 --> 14:56.528
Why?

14:56.595 --> 14:57.863
Maybe you
came to meet me.

14:59.198 --> 15:00.933
Well, I'm certainly
glad I did.

15:02.801 --> 15:05.070

still open in our time?

15:07.940 --> 15:09.208
Precisely.

Which means, we can walk
straight through it.

just for a moment.

to the place in this article,
