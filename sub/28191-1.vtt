[♪♪♪]

00:17.184 --> 00:18.650
Hey, Lucy?

00:18.686 --> 00:20.753
I just thinking
about Mom and Dad,

00:20.788 --> 00:22.788
and I think
we should do something

00:22.823 --> 00:24.656
really special for them.

00:24.692 --> 00:25.891
Like a surprise party.

00:25.926 --> 00:28.260
A ruby anniversary
is a huge milestone.

00:28.295 --> 00:30.329
Ahh...

00:30.364 --> 00:32.164
Yeah, but, I mean,

00:32.199 --> 00:34.299
do you think they want us making
that big of a deal out of it?

00:34.335 --> 00:37.136
Happily married for 40 years?

00:37.171 --> 00:39.138
No doubt
they're expecting a trophy.

00:39.173 --> 00:40.806
That's true.

00:40.841 --> 00:42.975
-Speaking of getting married,

00:43.010 --> 00:45.310
maybe it's time for you
to meet new people.

00:45.346 --> 00:46.612
I meet plenty
of new people!

00:46.647 --> 00:48.781
Yes, but do you date people?

00:48.816 --> 00:51.283
My work is very busy
right now.

00:51.318 --> 00:53.752
I don't have time
for a relationship.

00:53.788 --> 00:55.354
There are
good guys out there.

00:55.389 --> 00:56.555
That's easy for you to say,

00:56.590 --> 00:58.357
Miss Happily Married 10 Years.

00:58.392 --> 01:00.492
Actually, it's "Mrs."

01:00.528 --> 01:02.561
Exactly my point.

01:02.596 --> 01:04.730
Hey, you know,
do you still have

01:04.765 --> 01:06.065
that "wedding wish" book
you made when you were a kid?

01:06.100 --> 01:08.500
You want it for the baby?

01:08.536 --> 01:09.735
No. For you.

01:09.770 --> 01:12.638
To remind you of what
you thought love could be.

01:12.673 --> 01:14.706
I don't know,
I'll look for it,

01:14.742 --> 01:17.776
but who knows
if it even still exists.

01:19.080 --> 01:22.114
Hey! Look. It's a rainbow.

01:22.149 --> 01:25.350
It's a sign
it's gonna be a great day.

01:25.386 --> 01:27.152
[Lucy chuckles]

01:27.188 --> 01:29.121
Let's hope so.

01:31.659 --> 01:33.225
Dad, look!

01:33.260 --> 01:35.527
A rainbow.
Let's go chase it.

01:35.563 --> 01:38.697
Maybe we can
chase rainbows later, Sophie.

01:38.732 --> 01:40.132
Come on, let's go.

01:40.167 --> 01:42.534
-Dad!
-Go, go, go!

01:44.238 --> 01:46.805
[♪♪♪]

02:04.325 --> 02:05.524
Oh.

02:05.559 --> 02:08.127
[♪♪♪]

02:15.035 --> 02:16.502
Hmm.

02:19.306 --> 02:20.939
Yeah.

02:26.413 --> 02:27.913
[Ben]:
Oh, no, no, no, no.

02:27.948 --> 02:29.114
There is a distinct difference

02:29.150 --> 02:30.816
between the Arabica
and the Robusta.

02:30.851 --> 02:32.851
[barista]:
Uh, can I help you?

02:34.221 --> 02:35.254
Ms. Mocha!

02:35.289 --> 02:37.289
Hi, Ben.

02:37.324 --> 02:38.657
You know, we still

02:38.692 --> 02:40.692
have to do that dinner
we've been talking about.

02:41.762 --> 02:43.095
Oh. Right. Y-Yeah.

02:43.130 --> 02:44.963
I've just been super-busy.

02:45.866 --> 02:47.533
Uh, what can I get
started for you?

02:47.568 --> 02:49.902
Uh, right. Can I get a--

02:49.937 --> 02:51.904
Lucy will have a grande
coconut mocha, extra whip.

02:51.939 --> 02:53.005
It's her fave.

02:55.509 --> 02:58.243
What about charcuterie?

02:58.279 --> 02:59.478
In the mocha?

02:59.513 --> 03:00.445
For dinner.

03:00.481 --> 03:02.114
Oh. Y-Yeah.

03:02.149 --> 03:04.082
Sure. [chuckling]

03:04.118 --> 03:06.652
"Charcuterie."
It's my favorite, so--

03:06.687 --> 03:08.287
Oh, this one's on the house.

03:08.322 --> 03:11.290
Oh. Thank you, Ben.

03:11.325 --> 03:12.457
[whispers]:
I'll text you.

03:13.294 --> 03:15.327
Great.

03:16.397 --> 03:19.131
Grande coconut mocha.
Extra whip.

03:19.166 --> 03:22.267
Uh, um, actually,
I think that's mine.

03:22.303 --> 03:23.635
Uh, no, I'm pretty sure
it's mine.

03:23.671 --> 03:26.438
Unless your name is "Jackie"?

03:26.473 --> 03:28.674
Uh, no. Is yours?

03:28.709 --> 03:29.675
Uh, yeah. Sort of.

03:29.710 --> 03:31.343
I'm Jack.

03:31.378 --> 03:32.945
Grande coconut mocha.
Extra whip.

03:32.980 --> 03:34.947
Oh. Well, hello, "Lucky."

03:34.982 --> 03:37.349
Mm. Ah, it's actually "Lucy,"
but so close.

03:37.384 --> 03:40.219
Do you think baristas train
in getting our names wrong?

03:40.254 --> 03:42.120
You know,
it would seem that way.

03:42.156 --> 03:43.689
Yeah, I actually have
a friend on the inside.

03:43.724 --> 03:44.990
I'll look into it.

03:45.025 --> 03:46.124
-Mm, a woman with
coffee connections.

03:46.160 --> 03:48.827
Sounds pretty "lucky" to me.

03:48.862 --> 03:50.596
No. I-I am
definitely not lucky.

03:50.631 --> 03:52.698
Yeah, well,
don't sell yourself short.

03:52.733 --> 03:53.632
Oh!

03:53.667 --> 03:55.133
[Jack gasping]

03:55.169 --> 03:56.101
Oh...

03:56.136 --> 03:57.135
Oh, my gosh!

03:57.171 --> 03:58.503
Wow! Oh.

03:58.539 --> 03:59.771
Oh, my gosh! I'm so sorry.

03:59.807 --> 04:00.906
No. No, no. It's fine.

04:00.941 --> 04:02.874
It's fine. It's fine.
I came here to get warmed up.

04:02.910 --> 04:04.643
I just thought that coffee
would be doing it...

04:04.678 --> 04:07.012
internally,
and not on my...

04:07.047 --> 04:08.580
Here. Take those.

04:08.616 --> 04:11.416
Can I-- Can I at least
get you another?

04:11.452 --> 04:13.185
No, no, no. It's fine.
I have more shirts at home.

04:13.220 --> 04:15.487
I-I meant the coffee.

04:15.522 --> 04:16.888
I know. I was--
I was kidding.

04:16.924 --> 04:18.991
[laughs] Right. Yeah.

04:19.026 --> 04:21.193
Here. You know what,
take mine.

04:21.228 --> 04:22.594
No. Can we please get a refill?

04:22.630 --> 04:23.996
They'll...

04:24.031 --> 04:24.863
I am so sorry.

04:24.898 --> 04:27.266
I, and I have to run,
'cause I'm late.

04:27.301 --> 04:28.734
No. Not a problem. Go, go, go.
I'll see you around sometime.

04:28.769 --> 04:30.435
-I'm sorry.
-No problem.

04:30.471 --> 04:32.237
Next time, I'll be the guy
in the hazmat suit.

04:32.273 --> 04:34.373
-[laughing]
-Safety first.

04:34.408 --> 04:36.775
Bye! I told you--
definitely not lucky.

04:36.810 --> 04:39.311
[♪♪♪]

04:41.882 --> 04:43.282
Thought you got lost in there.

04:43.317 --> 04:44.316
Yeah, sorry about that.

04:44.351 --> 04:47.052
I had a bit of a mocha mishap,
as you can see.

04:47.087 --> 04:48.553
-Yeah.
-Totally worth it, though.

04:48.589 --> 04:50.522
Best coffee in town right here.

04:50.557 --> 04:51.923
Your shirt seems to agree.

04:51.959 --> 04:54.192
Now can we go chase rainbows?

04:54.228 --> 04:56.261
-Uh, no, now we can
get me cleaned up

04:56.297 --> 04:57.663
and you ready for school,

04:57.698 --> 05:00.732
so you can go meet
all sorts of fun new friends.

05:00.768 --> 05:04.269
-Well, I think you should
meet some new friends.

05:04.305 --> 05:06.405
I promise we will do
all sorts of fun things

05:06.440 --> 05:07.673
once we get settled.

05:07.708 --> 05:08.740
Like chasing rainbows?

05:08.776 --> 05:11.710
Why else move to the rainbow
capital of America,

05:11.745 --> 05:13.245
and not chase rainbows?

05:13.280 --> 05:15.714
Okay, first of all,
that's not a fact.

05:15.749 --> 05:17.582
Secondly,
because I got transferred here,

05:17.618 --> 05:18.617
and third,

05:18.652 --> 05:20.619
I'm gonna get another one
of these for the road,

05:20.654 --> 05:22.120
because they are delicious.

05:22.156 --> 05:23.755
No, Dad!
We are gonna be late.

05:23.791 --> 05:25.991
Oh, who's
"Little Miss On-Time" now?

05:26.026 --> 05:27.659
[school bell ringing]

05:27.695 --> 05:28.660
[Lucy]: Okay, class.

05:28.696 --> 05:30.896
The science fair
is going to be in three weeks,

05:30.931 --> 05:32.064
and this year,

05:32.099 --> 05:34.399
the winner gets to pick
a field trip of their choice.

05:34.435 --> 05:35.634
[kids murmuring]

05:35.669 --> 05:38.170
So I want you guys
putting a lot of thought

05:38.205 --> 05:39.838
into what you guys are going
to do this year,

05:39.873 --> 05:41.173
all right? Okay.

05:42.242 --> 05:44.910
It's going to be just as fun
as Chicago, I promise.

05:44.945 --> 05:47.245
You've been saying that
the whole way here.

05:47.281 --> 05:48.413
Because it's true!

05:48.449 --> 05:50.716
Come on!
Everybody's going to love you.

05:52.386 --> 05:53.785
Okay, class, who can name

05:53.821 --> 05:56.288
some of the world's
best inventors?

05:56.323 --> 05:57.289
Yeah, Ryan?

05:57.324 --> 05:59.624
Elon Musk. My dad says
energy is the future.

05:59.660 --> 06:01.193
Oh. Very nice. Maya?

06:01.228 --> 06:02.294
Grace Hopper.

06:02.329 --> 06:03.862
My mom says
the future is female.

06:03.897 --> 06:06.098
Both very good answers.

06:06.133 --> 06:08.500
Well, as you guys can see,
there are a lot of inventors

06:08.535 --> 06:09.434
and scientists

06:09.470 --> 06:11.136
and things to choose from
for your project,

06:11.171 --> 06:12.637
so why don't we--
-[knocking]

06:12.673 --> 06:13.872
Hold on.

06:13.907 --> 06:16.608
Sorry to interrupt, Ms. Taylor,
but we have a new student.

06:16.643 --> 06:17.476
Oh! Fantastic.

06:17.511 --> 06:19.644
[Principal]:
I'll let you settle in.

06:21.648 --> 06:23.248
[chuckling] Hi.

06:23.283 --> 06:24.816
Hi.

06:24.852 --> 06:26.685
I'm Jack Evans.
This is my daughter, Sophie.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.720
Hi, Sophie. I'm Lucy.

06:28.756 --> 06:30.522
...Taylor. Ms. Taylor.

06:30.557 --> 06:31.990
-Yeah, I'm sorry
we're late this morning.

06:32.025 --> 06:33.225
I had a bit of a... thing.

06:33.260 --> 06:35.327
-Yeah. Of course.
-Yeah.

06:35.362 --> 06:36.862
Uh, well, Sophie,

06:36.897 --> 06:39.631
we are just pairing up
to start brainstorming

06:39.666 --> 06:40.565
about our science fair
projects.

06:40.601 --> 06:43.468
So why don't I partner you up
with Maya?

06:43.504 --> 06:44.636
[Ryan]: She can have my spot.

06:44.671 --> 06:47.305
Perfect. You can sit
next to Parker.

06:47.341 --> 06:49.207
[quietly]: See? Look at that.
You're making friends already.

06:49.243 --> 06:50.375
See you after school.

06:50.411 --> 06:51.443
I love you.

06:54.381 --> 06:57.082
And, uh, thank you, "Lucky."

06:58.919 --> 07:00.519
Uh, class, start talking
about your projects.

07:00.554 --> 07:01.787
I'll be right back.

07:01.822 --> 07:03.922
Hi.

07:03.957 --> 07:05.524
Mr. Evans.

07:05.559 --> 07:08.560
Are we not past the formalities
after the whole coffee incident?

07:08.595 --> 07:10.195
"Jackie." Remember?

07:10.230 --> 07:11.563
Of course. Right.

07:11.598 --> 07:14.199
And I see you chose cotton
instead of coffee.

07:14.234 --> 07:15.534
It's a very nice choice.

07:15.569 --> 07:16.535
Yes. Thank you.

07:16.570 --> 07:18.603
Anyway, I just wanted
to say it's a pleasure

07:18.639 --> 07:19.871
to meet
your daughter, Sophie.

07:19.907 --> 07:21.173
Well, look. Sometimes,

07:21.208 --> 07:22.641
students have
a little problem adjusting

07:22.676 --> 07:24.409
when they join a class
part way through the year,

07:24.445 --> 07:26.745
if you or Sophie or your wife

07:26.780 --> 07:28.680
ever want to come in
to speak with me,

07:28.715 --> 07:30.282
my door is always open.

07:30.317 --> 07:32.150
Except for now.

07:32.186 --> 07:33.752
Right. Yes.

07:33.787 --> 07:35.287
Except for right at this moment,
but otherwise...

07:35.322 --> 07:36.855
-Yes.
-Always open.

07:36.890 --> 07:38.023
So, you know,

07:38.058 --> 07:39.558
if you or Sophie's mom
want to come in...

07:39.593 --> 07:41.560
Well, I don't, um...

07:42.629 --> 07:44.429
Thank you for that.

07:44.465 --> 07:47.599
Um, I should try not to be late
for my first day at work, so...

07:47.634 --> 07:49.935
I don't want to be reprimanded.

07:49.970 --> 07:51.036
Of course.

07:51.071 --> 07:53.038
You can always just tell them
you got spilled on.

07:53.073 --> 07:54.306
Oh, yeah. No.

07:54.341 --> 07:56.074
I will definitely
be blaming you.

07:56.109 --> 07:57.275
-Great.
-That's for sure.

07:57.311 --> 07:58.477
-Good to know.
-Okay. Bye!

07:58.512 --> 07:59.678
Bye.

08:01.415 --> 08:03.215
Oh... Jack Evans.

08:03.250 --> 08:04.916
What? You know him?

08:04.952 --> 08:06.785
His daughter, Sophie,
was almost placed in my class,

08:06.820 --> 08:07.819
but we were too full.

08:07.855 --> 08:10.322
Such a shame,
what happened.

08:10.357 --> 08:12.057
What do you mean?

08:12.092 --> 08:14.059
You know,
because his wife passed,

08:14.094 --> 08:16.795
and now it's just
the two of them.

08:16.830 --> 08:20.765
Uh... I didn't know.

08:20.801 --> 08:22.367
I should get back to class.

08:29.977 --> 08:31.910
[♪♪♪]

08:31.945 --> 08:33.478
[Brad]:
We usually do our meetings

08:33.514 --> 08:34.312
from the break room

08:34.348 --> 08:36.147
rather than
the conference center.

08:36.183 --> 08:37.649
Creates
a more relaxed atmosphere.

08:37.684 --> 08:39.551
Well, the relaxed atmosphere

08:39.586 --> 08:41.786
was one of the big incentives
for me in transferring, so.

08:41.822 --> 08:42.854
The word is

08:42.890 --> 08:45.023
you were quite the force
at the Chicago firm, Jack.

08:45.058 --> 08:46.825
I hope you're not
getting soft on us.

08:46.860 --> 08:47.826
Oh, no, still a force, Brad.

08:47.861 --> 08:48.827
Now I'm just doing it

08:48.862 --> 08:51.596
on your relaxed,
West Coast time.

08:51.632 --> 08:52.764
[Brad]: We're doing
a refurbishment

08:52.799 --> 08:53.999
of the Ocean Park Bridge.

08:54.034 --> 08:56.167
Maintaining
its original architecture

08:56.203 --> 08:58.370
while doing a retrofit
of the infrastructure.

08:58.405 --> 08:59.638
Oh. Sounds great.

08:59.673 --> 09:02.173
We promised the city
we'd be done in three weeks.

09:05.012 --> 09:07.112
-Three weeks?
-Yes.

09:07.147 --> 09:09.314
Uh, w-with all due respect,

09:09.349 --> 09:10.949
I think that's impossible.

09:10.984 --> 09:13.685
Oh, I think he meant
"I'm possible."

09:13.720 --> 09:15.353
Jack, do you know
Kevin Monroe?

09:15.389 --> 09:17.656
Uh, no. Hey.

09:17.691 --> 09:19.190
Jack Evans.
Good to meet you.

09:19.226 --> 09:20.458
Hey, don't worry.
You're in good hands.

09:20.494 --> 09:23.194
I've been known to... tch!
Save the day.

09:23.230 --> 09:24.296
Well...

09:24.331 --> 09:26.197
Kevin will be your right hand
through all of this,

09:26.233 --> 09:28.333
so I have complete faith
you two can get this done.

09:28.368 --> 09:31.069
Aye-aye, Captain.

09:31.104 --> 09:32.037
Yep.

09:32.072 --> 09:34.005
Glad to have you here, Jack.

09:34.041 --> 09:35.740
[uncertainly]:
It's good to be here.

09:35.776 --> 09:37.609
[Kevin, loudly]:
Consider it done, Brad!

09:37.644 --> 09:39.077
[Jack sighs]

09:39.112 --> 09:42.314
Oh, this is gonna
be impossible.

09:42.349 --> 09:43.915
Yeah. I know.

09:43.951 --> 09:44.983
But you just said--

09:45.018 --> 09:46.017
-Hmm?
-You just told the boss

09:46.053 --> 09:47.686
that... "no problem."

09:47.721 --> 09:49.321
Oh, yeah, I've also been known
to fudge the truth

09:49.356 --> 09:50.755
just to make people feel better.

09:50.791 --> 09:53.124
But don't worry.
We got-- We got this.

09:54.695 --> 09:56.461
[Kevin groans anxiously]

09:57.464 --> 09:58.730
Hey, ladies.

09:58.765 --> 09:59.731
Nice drawings.

09:59.766 --> 10:01.066
I like cats.

10:01.101 --> 10:02.500
And I like rainbows.

10:02.536 --> 10:04.069
Did you guys figure out
what you want to do

10:04.104 --> 10:05.870
for your science fair
projects yet?

10:05.906 --> 10:07.272
No, not yet.

10:07.307 --> 10:09.174
All right, well,
keep thinking about it.

10:09.209 --> 10:10.542
We'll figure it out together.

10:10.577 --> 10:12.010
All right, class.

10:12.045 --> 10:14.412
We're gonna go outside
for a special surprise.

10:15.782 --> 10:18.717
[♪♪♪]

10:19.920 --> 10:21.753
[Jack, quietly]:
Oh, God.

10:21.788 --> 10:23.922
So you're from Chicago, huh?

10:23.957 --> 10:26.057
Yep.

10:26.093 --> 10:27.359
Excellent,
so what's your story?

10:27.394 --> 10:29.260
You married? Kids?
On the run from the law?

10:29.296 --> 10:30.762
I mean, I guess not,
if you're working here.

10:30.797 --> 10:34.933
Um, well, I was, uh, I was
born and raised in Chicago.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.134
Go, Cubs. Go.

10:36.169 --> 10:38.103
Fly the "W" 2016.

10:40.140 --> 10:41.573
You're not a baseball...

10:42.643 --> 10:45.810
Well, I-I have a daughter
named Sophie

10:45.846 --> 10:46.911
and she is 10.

10:46.947 --> 10:48.313
Great.

10:48.348 --> 10:49.648
That's gotta be kind of hard,

10:49.683 --> 10:50.982
moving so far away
from her mom.

10:51.018 --> 10:52.784
She passed away.

10:54.021 --> 10:55.253
Oh, shoot. I...

10:55.288 --> 10:56.788
-I'm so sorry.
-It's fine.

10:56.823 --> 10:58.256
I'm... idiot.

10:58.291 --> 10:59.724
I do that.
It's, like...

10:59.760 --> 11:00.959
foot in mouth.

11:00.994 --> 11:03.328
My wife says it's literally
a disease with me.

11:03.363 --> 11:04.929
It's like I just
keep going and going.

11:04.965 --> 11:05.964
But, look, hey.

11:05.999 --> 11:07.565
Ocean Hill is gonna
feel like home in no time,

11:07.601 --> 11:09.134
if I have
anything to do with it.

11:10.470 --> 11:12.504
Well, thank you.

11:12.539 --> 11:15.140
Kevin, seriously.

11:15.175 --> 11:19.144
So, today, we will be planting
the seeds for our future.

11:19.179 --> 11:21.446
And we'll put a wish in there
with them,

11:21.481 --> 11:23.982
and then,
when the flowers bloom,

11:24.017 --> 11:26.951
we will see
if our wishes came true.

11:28.722 --> 11:32.257
Any idea what
you want to wish for, Sophie?

11:32.292 --> 11:34.259
I think I want
to chase rainbows.

11:34.294 --> 11:35.794
Oh, that sounds like fun.

11:35.829 --> 11:37.228
You should make a wish, too.

11:38.999 --> 11:41.332
You know what?
You're right.

11:50.043 --> 11:51.676
There.

11:51.712 --> 11:52.877
I made one, too.

11:52.913 --> 11:55.814
Do you actually think
wishes come true?

11:56.883 --> 11:59.818
Yeah. Yeah, of course,
they do, Sophie.

12:01.088 --> 12:02.520
Hey, have you ever
heard of Queen's Park?

12:02.556 --> 12:04.222
-No.

12:04.257 --> 12:06.558
Well, it's a really famous
park here in Ocean Hill,

12:06.593 --> 12:08.460
that's known for having
a lot of rainbows.

12:08.495 --> 12:10.228
That seems so cool.

12:10.263 --> 12:11.463
-Yeah, it's beautiful.

12:11.498 --> 12:12.764
And you know,

12:12.799 --> 12:14.966
whoever wins the science fair,
they actually win a field trip.

12:15.001 --> 12:16.201
So maybe if you win,

12:16.236 --> 12:18.336
we could take the whole class
to Queen's Park.

12:18.371 --> 12:19.904
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

12:19.940 --> 12:24.242
I think I want to make rainbows
for my science fair project.

12:24.277 --> 12:27.345
I think that sounds
like an excellent idea, Sophie.

12:29.216 --> 12:31.649
All right, how are the seeds
coming, you guys?

12:31.685 --> 12:32.984
Good.

12:33.019 --> 12:35.253
I think I made my wish.

12:37.257 --> 12:39.457
[school bell rings]

12:42.696 --> 12:43.862
[knocking at door]

12:43.897 --> 12:45.263
[Jack]: Hey.

12:45.298 --> 12:46.998
I'm sorry I'm so late.

12:47.033 --> 12:49.667
Uh, no, it's fine,
we were just finishing up.

12:49.703 --> 12:53.037
How did
your first day go, sweetie?

12:53.073 --> 12:54.305
It was really good.

12:54.341 --> 12:57.742
I'm making rainbows
for my science fair project.

12:57.778 --> 13:00.545
Oh. Cool.

13:00.580 --> 13:02.347
Okay, well,
can you get packed up?

13:02.382 --> 13:03.515
We'll get going.

13:03.550 --> 13:04.916
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

13:04.951 --> 13:06.718
Can I talk to you
for a second?

13:06.753 --> 13:09.487
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

13:09.523 --> 13:12.390
Has she settled in?
How did it all go?

13:12.425 --> 13:13.892
It was great.
She was really happy.

13:13.927 --> 13:16.194
Good.

13:16.229 --> 13:18.429
And she's doing a project
on rainbows?

13:18.465 --> 13:20.565
Yeah, she's very excited
about it.

13:20.600 --> 13:22.667
We might even get a chance
take a field trip

13:22.702 --> 13:24.435
to go chase some rainbows.

13:24.471 --> 13:26.371
She said you've been
meaning to take her,

13:26.406 --> 13:28.873
but you've just been too busy
to do it, so.

13:28.909 --> 13:29.874
She said that, huh?

13:29.910 --> 13:30.875
Yeah.

13:30.911 --> 13:33.678
I'm-- I didn't...
I mean, I hope that's okay.

13:33.713 --> 13:36.347
Oh, yeah. No, no, no.
It's fine, it's just, um...

13:36.383 --> 13:38.249
It's a little complicated.
It's nothing.

13:38.285 --> 13:39.384
I get it.

13:39.419 --> 13:42.187
Like I said, you know,
you want to talk, door's open.

13:42.222 --> 13:43.388
Well, now it is.

13:43.423 --> 13:44.923
Like, seri--
-[Lucy laughs]

13:44.958 --> 13:48.626
Uh, and we will exit through it
and let you finish work.

13:48.662 --> 13:49.694
Okay, great.

13:49.729 --> 13:50.728
Bye, Ms. Taylor.

13:50.764 --> 13:51.696
Bye, Sophie.

13:51.731 --> 13:54.165
-Thanks again.
-Yeah.

13:58.672 --> 14:00.004
[sighs]

14:02.142 --> 14:04.776
Life would just be better
if I had a big giant eraser.

14:04.811 --> 14:07.312
Oh, honey, you didn't know.

14:07.347 --> 14:09.948
I brought up his wife,
like, five times.

14:09.983 --> 14:12.050
I'm sure it wasn't that bad.

14:12.085 --> 14:13.051
Besides, it's good to know

14:13.086 --> 14:15.320
you're at least curious
about finding a man.

14:15.355 --> 14:17.388
Oh, not you, too.

14:17.424 --> 14:19.624
Are you and Dana on some kind
of dating tag team?

14:19.659 --> 14:21.459
What about
that Ben character?

14:21.494 --> 14:23.394
The, um, the store manager?

14:23.430 --> 14:27.265
He wants to go to charcuterie
or something.

14:27.300 --> 14:28.766
Is that what dating is now?

14:28.802 --> 14:30.335
You're asking me?

14:30.370 --> 14:31.970
[scoffs lightly]

14:32.005 --> 14:33.438
I just--
I don't want to settle.

14:33.473 --> 14:35.073
[sighs heavily]

14:35.108 --> 14:37.275
No relationship
is perfect, honey,

14:37.310 --> 14:39.344
but how will you know
how you feel

14:39.379 --> 14:41.579
unless you give him a chance?

14:41.615 --> 14:44.115
I don't know
who this guy is,

14:44.150 --> 14:45.950
but you're definitely
major league, sweetie.

14:45.986 --> 14:47.819
Don't settle
for some guy from the minors.

14:47.854 --> 14:50.288
Thanks, Dad.
Hey, how's your team doing?

14:50.323 --> 14:51.556
Robbed.

14:51.591 --> 14:54.259
But this is our year.

14:54.294 --> 14:55.493
Oh, he says that every year.

14:55.528 --> 14:58.396
Oh, I know.
The eternal optimist.

14:58.431 --> 15:00.331
You know,
you can have it all.

15:00.367 --> 15:03.801
You just have
to believe you can.

15:03.837 --> 15:06.804
Yeah, I know.
Thanks, Mom.

15:08.708 --> 15:10.975
Don't steal now!
Oh, come on!

15:11.011 --> 15:12.110
[women chuckle]

15:12.145 --> 15:15.079
[♪♪♪]

15:25.158 --> 15:26.224
Wow...

15:27.193 --> 15:30.328
It's like
a rainbow exploded in here.

15:30.363 --> 15:32.030
Awesome, right?

15:32.065 --> 15:33.264
-Yeah, it is, sweetie.

15:33.300 --> 15:35.633
Um, well, finish up
what you're doing.

15:35.669 --> 15:37.802
Lights out in 10, okay?

15:37.837 --> 15:39.370
Dad?

15:42.108 --> 15:44.075
Why aren't you excited
about my project?

15:44.110 --> 15:46.644
Oh, I am, sweetie.
It's just, um...

15:46.680 --> 15:48.646
Now you can work

15:48.682 --> 15:50.148
and not be so stressed
to be there,

15:50.183 --> 15:51.983
'cause I have
Ms. Taylor to help me.

15:52.018 --> 15:53.785
See? Win-win?

15:55.355 --> 15:58.990
You are a wise old soul,
young lady.

15:59.025 --> 16:01.559
Who's the parent here anyway,
you or me?

16:01.594 --> 16:02.627
I don't know.
You tell me.

16:02.662 --> 16:04.762
Well, the correct answer is,
I'm the parent here.

16:04.798 --> 16:06.030
-Right?
-Yeah. Okay.

16:06.066 --> 16:07.832
Listen.

16:07.867 --> 16:10.234
I'm excited
if you're excited.

16:10.270 --> 16:11.402
Yes!

16:11.438 --> 16:12.770
Yeah. All right.

16:12.806 --> 16:13.871
Did you brush your teeth?

16:13.907 --> 16:15.039
Yeah.

16:15.075 --> 16:17.842
All right, well, you can
finish all this in the morning.

16:17.877 --> 16:19.077
Let's get to bed. Okay?

16:19.112 --> 16:20.244
-Okay.
-I'll tuck you in.

16:22.048 --> 16:24.682
Okay? There you go.

16:24.718 --> 16:26.918
Rawr! Snug as a bug in a rug!

16:26.953 --> 16:28.953
Tell me the story.

16:28.989 --> 16:31.022
Um, what story?

16:31.057 --> 16:33.224
You know.
Mom's story.

16:33.259 --> 16:34.926
Oh, that story. Right.

16:34.961 --> 16:36.995
Well...

16:37.030 --> 16:40.631
when you were
just a wee little baby,

16:40.667 --> 16:44.736
your mom used to sing you
her favorite song

16:44.771 --> 16:46.204
right before bed,

16:46.239 --> 16:48.239
and, um...

16:49.843 --> 16:52.210
For the life of me,
I can't remember what it is.

16:52.245 --> 16:53.044
What was that song again?

16:53.079 --> 16:55.413
Dad. "Somewhere
Over the Rainbow."

16:55.448 --> 16:57.615
"Somewhere Over the Rainbow,"
that's right.

17:04.157 --> 17:06.891
I love you so much, my angel.

17:06.926 --> 17:09.527
I love you, too.

17:10.597 --> 17:11.829
Sleep tight.

17:11.865 --> 17:13.798
Good night.

17:37.957 --> 17:38.956
[Lucy]: Hey.

17:38.992 --> 17:40.191
Did you figure out
what you're working on yet?

17:40.226 --> 17:43.528
I'm making a clean compost,
so rotten food doesn't stink.

17:43.563 --> 17:45.396
Ah!
That is a really smart idea.

17:45.432 --> 17:47.799
You know, you might wind up
on that list of best inventors

17:47.834 --> 17:49.267
yourself one day.

17:49.302 --> 17:50.968
[Lucy chuckles]

17:51.004 --> 17:53.471
Oh, wow, Sophie,
that looks beautiful.

17:53.506 --> 17:54.605
Thank you.

17:54.641 --> 17:56.941
They always melt in my hands
when I eat them,

17:56.976 --> 17:58.676
that's how I had the idea.

17:58.711 --> 18:01.345
Ah. Well, that is
a very smart idea.

18:01.381 --> 18:02.447
Thank you.

18:02.482 --> 18:03.748
Hey.

18:03.783 --> 18:05.950
Have you ever seen...

18:05.985 --> 18:07.585
one of these?

18:07.620 --> 18:08.553
No.

18:08.588 --> 18:10.855
Well, when you shine light
directly on it,

18:10.890 --> 18:12.890
it actually reflects rainbows
all over the place.

18:12.926 --> 18:13.891
It's called a prism.

18:13.927 --> 18:15.460
That's so cool.

18:15.495 --> 18:16.694
I know, right?

18:18.565 --> 18:20.164
Would you want to keep it?

18:20.200 --> 18:22.166
Really?

18:22.202 --> 18:24.635
Yeah. Absolutely.

18:24.671 --> 18:27.205
Thanks, Ms. Taylor.

18:27.240 --> 18:28.573
You're very welcome.

18:39.385 --> 18:40.451
[Kevin]: Good. Good. Great.

18:40.487 --> 18:41.352
So, talk to me,

18:41.387 --> 18:42.687
have you been
getting out there much?

18:42.722 --> 18:43.654
[Jack]: Does running count?

18:43.690 --> 18:44.655
[Kevin]: Absolutely not.

18:44.691 --> 18:46.591
Look, it is my mission
to have you out there,

18:46.626 --> 18:48.292
loving this place, ASAP.

18:48.328 --> 18:50.294
-Yeah, sure thing,
once I have free time.

18:50.330 --> 18:51.162
-Okay, we both have kids,

18:51.197 --> 18:52.897
we know
that is never gonna happen.

18:52.932 --> 18:55.266
I have a brilliant idea.

18:55.301 --> 18:56.434
I'm not gonna
tell you what it is,

18:56.469 --> 18:58.569
but you're gonna love it.

19:00.907 --> 19:01.939
[Lucy sighs]

19:01.975 --> 19:04.208
I can't believe I let you guys
talk me into this.

19:04.244 --> 19:06.811
But, you know, you never know
who you could meet here.

19:06.846 --> 19:07.812
Maybe your soulmate.

19:07.847 --> 19:08.813
No pressure.

19:08.848 --> 19:10.248
Thank you, Mom.

19:10.283 --> 19:12.283
But why, uh, why didn't
Dad come out today?

19:12.318 --> 19:13.451
Well...

19:13.486 --> 19:14.619
you know your father.

19:14.654 --> 19:17.455
He'd rather watch sports
than play them.

19:17.490 --> 19:20.224
Ocean Park Bridge
is closed for construction,

19:20.260 --> 19:22.426
so it took a lifetime
to get here,

19:22.462 --> 19:23.628
and now my mocha's cold.

19:23.663 --> 19:25.096
Are you gonna run
with a coffee?

19:25.131 --> 19:26.063
Oh, if I'm gonna run at all,

19:26.099 --> 19:27.765
I'm gonna need
at least two of these first.

19:28.835 --> 19:29.901
Why am I here?

19:29.936 --> 19:31.402
Because Dana is ditching me

19:31.437 --> 19:32.937
and I need you to be
my new running mate.

19:32.972 --> 19:33.971
I hate running.

19:34.007 --> 19:36.841
Okay, come on, you guys,
dial up the positivity.

19:36.876 --> 19:37.909
Let's do this!

19:37.944 --> 19:39.410
I think,
if we double up the rebar--

19:39.445 --> 19:40.444
Oh!

19:40.480 --> 19:41.612
Oh, I'm so sorry.

19:41.648 --> 19:44.348
Oh! "Jackie," well, hello.

19:44.384 --> 19:45.816
"Lucky," hi.

19:45.852 --> 19:47.151
Nice to bump into you again.

19:47.187 --> 19:48.286
-And you.

19:48.321 --> 19:50.988
Although, I prefer you
without hot beverages in hand.

19:51.024 --> 19:52.857
Ah, touche.

19:52.892 --> 19:54.358
Uh, this is

19:54.394 --> 19:57.061
my new buddy,
Kevin, from work.

19:57.096 --> 19:58.095
Hi.

19:58.131 --> 19:59.664
-Oh, uh, cool.

19:59.699 --> 20:02.466
And this is my sister, Dana,
and my mom, Mary,

20:02.502 --> 20:04.769
and you probably
recognize Cassidy.

20:04.804 --> 20:06.504
She teaches
at the school as well.

20:06.539 --> 20:08.606
-I do, indeed. Hey.

20:08.641 --> 20:12.109
Uh, Jack is the father
of one of my students, Sophie.

20:12.145 --> 20:13.477
Speaking of--
is she here today?

20:13.513 --> 20:15.446
Uh, no,
she's at the babysitter's.

20:15.481 --> 20:18.849
She runs with me sometimes,
but Kevin said adults only, so.

20:18.885 --> 20:20.351
Yeah, Jack loves running.

20:20.386 --> 20:22.186
That's why he's so fit.
And handsome.

20:22.222 --> 20:24.455
Me too, I love running, too.
Big-time.

20:24.490 --> 20:26.390
And I told him

20:26.426 --> 20:28.192
that this was actually
the place to meet peo--

20:28.228 --> 20:29.493
to get to know the city.

20:29.529 --> 20:30.861
[Jack clears his throat]

20:30.897 --> 20:32.163
And you know, take in
its good vibes,

20:32.198 --> 20:33.731
from the good people.

20:33.766 --> 20:35.766
But not me, though, I'm married.
I'm married. Big-time.

20:35.802 --> 20:36.968
Great. Okay.

20:37.003 --> 20:38.236
-You're good, buddy.
-Yeah.

20:38.271 --> 20:41.172
Uh, well, please,
tell Sophie I said hi.

20:41.207 --> 20:42.206
I will.

20:42.242 --> 20:43.874
[lead runner]:
Okay, everybody!

20:43.910 --> 20:45.676
It's time to get moving.
Let's do it!

20:45.712 --> 20:47.011
-Whoo!
-All right!

20:47.046 --> 20:48.713
-Let's go!
-After you.

20:48.748 --> 20:50.481
Lead it off, guys!

20:50.516 --> 20:54.051
[♪♪♪]

20:54.087 --> 20:56.120
Oh, you've got a pace there.

20:57.457 --> 20:58.756
This is gonna be fun.

21:02.929 --> 21:04.428
Where'd everyone go?
Did we lose the group?

21:04.464 --> 21:07.732
Yeah, I think we lost them
back at the bridge.

21:09.636 --> 21:11.569
Oh! Oh, look.

21:11.604 --> 21:12.870
There's a rainbow.

21:14.474 --> 21:16.741
[Jack]:
Oh, Sophie wasn't kidding.

21:16.776 --> 21:19.410
Those things
really are everywhere here.

21:19.445 --> 21:23.114
I see you don't exactly share
in Sophie's enthusiasm?

21:26.152 --> 21:27.785
It's complicated.

21:28.821 --> 21:29.887
Look, Jack, I know

21:29.922 --> 21:32.223
that you and Sophie came here,
you know, without...

21:32.258 --> 21:33.891
[Lucy stammers]

21:33.926 --> 21:35.326
I just...

21:35.361 --> 21:36.894
you know,
want you to know...

21:36.929 --> 21:38.763
Listen.

21:38.798 --> 21:40.197
You are so nice,

21:40.233 --> 21:43.301
and I'm really enjoying
getting to know you,

21:43.336 --> 21:44.735
but I'm...

21:44.771 --> 21:45.770
just thinking that maybe

21:45.805 --> 21:50.041
we can just focus
the running stuff for now, yeah?

21:50.076 --> 21:53.077
Maybe we can lap back
and find those laggers, huh?

21:53.112 --> 21:55.479
I'll set the pace.
Come on. Keep up.

21:55.515 --> 21:56.881
Okay.

21:56.916 --> 21:59.417
[♪♪♪]

22:02.955 --> 22:05.456
[Dana]:
Well, that was quite the scene.

22:05.491 --> 22:07.892
I know,
he just, like, bolted.

22:07.927 --> 22:08.926
Oh, if I recall,

22:08.961 --> 22:11.329
you both ran off
like your lives depended on it.

22:12.332 --> 22:13.964
Maybe he couldn't handle
all the sparks

22:14.000 --> 22:15.433
ricocheting off you two.

22:15.468 --> 22:17.401
Sparks? Please.

22:17.437 --> 22:18.769
I noticed them, too.

22:18.805 --> 22:20.638
And I think you're scared.

22:20.673 --> 22:23.407
Scared? Scared of what?

22:23.443 --> 22:25.810
The guy you like,
liking you back.

22:25.845 --> 22:28.279
Well, I tried to let him in,

22:28.314 --> 22:30.281
but he just ran for the hills.

22:30.316 --> 22:31.382
Literally.

22:31.417 --> 22:34.085
You should've seen your father
when we were dating.

22:34.120 --> 22:35.653
Chivalry.

22:35.688 --> 22:37.655
There's an act
long since dead.

22:37.690 --> 22:39.357
I mean, guys think
it's effort now

22:39.392 --> 22:41.359
if they put an emoji in a text.

22:41.394 --> 22:43.928
You know, your father used
to serenade me with music,

22:43.963 --> 22:47.598
and now he just uses
baseball metaphors.

22:47.633 --> 22:50.534
Dad still loves you, Mom.

22:50.570 --> 22:52.002
Oh, of course, he does.

22:52.038 --> 22:55.106
But married 40 years,
you know how it goes.

22:55.141 --> 22:57.041
Not a lot of surprises.

22:59.045 --> 23:01.312
[♪♪♪]

23:06.152 --> 23:07.885
[Dana]: We need to make
Mom and Dad's anniversary party

23:07.920 --> 23:08.986
really memorable.

23:09.021 --> 23:10.020
I know.

23:10.056 --> 23:11.689
Did you find your wish book?

23:11.724 --> 23:14.024
No! I looked for it.
I have no idea where it is.

23:14.060 --> 23:16.660
Well, did you look
in your memory box?

23:16.696 --> 23:18.696
[Lucy]:
I did and it's not there.

23:18.731 --> 23:20.931
[Jack engages remote alarm]

23:22.769 --> 23:23.601
I don't know, though.

23:23.636 --> 23:25.202
Should we go for the--
for the ruby,

23:25.238 --> 23:27.338
or for the classy silver,
for the color theme?

23:27.373 --> 23:30.941
I would go with the ruby
and the classy silver,

23:30.977 --> 23:31.976
personally.

23:32.011 --> 23:32.843
[Lucy]: Hi, Jack.

23:32.879 --> 23:34.879
-Hey.
-You remember my sister, Dana.

23:34.914 --> 23:37.248
-I do. Hi.
-Hi.

23:37.283 --> 23:38.983
Um, actually, maybe you two
could help me.

23:39.018 --> 23:41.886
Do you think I'd be able to find
more of these here?

23:41.921 --> 23:42.953
More of those?

23:42.989 --> 23:45.156
Oh, you know, I don't know,
they're pretty rare.

23:45.191 --> 23:46.457
Rare?

23:46.492 --> 23:48.759
Yeah. I don't know
if we're gonna find them here.

23:48.795 --> 23:51.195
Oh, I guess
it was worth a shot. Thanks.

23:51.230 --> 23:52.563
[chuckling] She's kidding.

23:52.598 --> 23:55.099
They have crystals
a couple of aisles over.

23:55.134 --> 23:56.233
Um...

23:56.269 --> 23:57.401
Thanks.

23:57.437 --> 23:59.570
Look, why don't
you go help him?

23:59.605 --> 24:00.838
I got this.

24:00.873 --> 24:03.707
Oh, uh, yeah, sure.
I-I could help you.

24:03.743 --> 24:05.109
You don't mind?

24:05.144 --> 24:07.545
-Yeah.
-Thanks.

24:08.915 --> 24:11.682
I wanted to apologize
for earlier,

24:11.717 --> 24:14.752
when I sort of ran away
from you there.

24:14.787 --> 24:17.721
I-I get it.
It's complicated.

24:18.791 --> 24:20.424
Right.

24:20.460 --> 24:24.628
Um, it's just-- it wasn't
because of the company.

24:24.664 --> 24:26.130
Yeah.

24:26.165 --> 24:28.132
It's just, um...

24:28.167 --> 24:29.700
I assume

24:29.735 --> 24:32.603
people at school know
kind of my history

24:32.638 --> 24:35.039
with my wife and...

24:35.074 --> 24:37.174
Yeah, she passed away
several years ago,

24:37.210 --> 24:40.845
and I don't like to really
talk about it that much,

24:40.880 --> 24:42.446
and Sophie was quite young,
so it was kind of--

24:42.482 --> 24:45.149
No, I totally understand.

24:45.184 --> 24:47.384
Yeah, and I mean,

24:47.420 --> 24:50.754
being a single dad
has been...

24:50.790 --> 24:53.090
humbling,
to say the least,

24:53.125 --> 24:55.392
and most days,
I'm just waiting

24:55.428 --> 24:58.229
for my "World's Worst Dad"
mug to arrive.

24:58.264 --> 24:59.630
Well... [chuckles]

24:59.665 --> 25:02.600
Look, for what it's worth,
Sophie's a great kid, so...

25:02.635 --> 25:04.001
you're doing something right.

25:04.036 --> 25:05.936
Oh, well, thank you for that.

25:05.972 --> 25:07.838
I mean, you're here
buying her prisms, so.

25:07.874 --> 25:09.173
So there's that.

25:09.208 --> 25:10.908
Yeah, so you're not
"World's Worst Dad."

25:10.943 --> 25:12.910
Okay, good.
Just a little bump up. Good.

25:12.945 --> 25:15.079
Uh, how many of these
did Sophie want?

25:15.114 --> 25:16.280
Uh, seven,
I believe she said.

25:16.315 --> 25:17.248
Okay.

25:17.283 --> 25:18.449
Let's get the big ones.

25:18.484 --> 25:20.918
Thank you.
Uh, these are for her...

25:20.953 --> 25:22.186
For her rainbows.

25:22.221 --> 25:24.121
Right.

25:24.156 --> 25:25.356
Thank you so much.

25:25.391 --> 25:26.490
[Lucy]: Yeah, absolutely.

25:26.526 --> 25:27.691
You saved me a load of time.

25:27.727 --> 25:31.428
I guess I should
get back to work, so.

25:31.464 --> 25:32.596
Oh. Working on a Saturday?

25:32.632 --> 25:33.430
Yeah, I know.

25:33.466 --> 25:35.966
We're chasing
this crazy deadline.

25:36.002 --> 25:36.967
Civil engineer.

25:37.003 --> 25:39.003
Working on the Ocean Park Bridge
refurbishment.

25:39.038 --> 25:40.337
Oh! Okay. That's you?

25:40.373 --> 25:41.238
-Very cool.
-Yeah, well.

25:41.274 --> 25:43.674
Was it always your dream
to build bridges?

25:43.709 --> 25:45.242
No. My dream was to be

25:45.278 --> 25:48.345
the starting pitcher
for the Chicago Cubs, but...

25:48.381 --> 25:50.080
Huh.

25:50.116 --> 25:51.682
Did not see that coming.

25:51.717 --> 25:53.617
-Hmm.
-Kinda came out of left-field.

25:53.653 --> 25:56.086
Well, I at least thought I was
kind of in a league of my own.

25:56.122 --> 25:58.322
Well, as long as
it's the majors.

25:58.357 --> 26:00.524
Yeah, well, I like to have
all my bases covered.

26:00.560 --> 26:01.559
You are foul.

26:01.594 --> 26:02.459
[laughs]

26:02.495 --> 26:05.563
Huh! You have
strong "Dad joke" game.

26:05.598 --> 26:07.598
You should meet my dad!

26:07.633 --> 26:08.732
Well, I hope to someday.

26:10.536 --> 26:11.669
You know what I mean.

26:11.704 --> 26:13.237
-Yeah.
-But, uh...

26:13.272 --> 26:14.505
thank you for this.

26:14.540 --> 26:15.506
Absolutely.

26:15.541 --> 26:17.341
And I will see you around.

26:17.376 --> 26:18.409
All right.

26:18.444 --> 26:19.977
Good to see you, Jack.

26:20.012 --> 26:21.712
Bye.

26:23.115 --> 26:26.083
[♪♪♪]

26:26.118 --> 26:27.184
[Jack]: Hey, honey.

26:27.219 --> 26:28.652
Mrs. Carlyle just left

26:28.688 --> 26:30.321
and she says dinner is ready.

26:30.356 --> 26:32.723
-Okay. Did you get them?
-I did.

26:32.758 --> 26:34.858
Crystals coming right up.

26:38.097 --> 26:39.763
They're perfect.

26:39.799 --> 26:41.732
Good. Glad to hear.

26:41.767 --> 26:43.567
Thanks.

26:43.603 --> 26:46.103
So, how did it go
with Mrs. Carlyle?

26:46.138 --> 26:49.406
Well... she's way too strict.

26:49.442 --> 26:51.141
Oh! Dear.

26:53.646 --> 26:57.281
How come you don't wear
the rainbow socks I got you?

26:57.316 --> 26:59.917
I guess I just forget.

26:59.952 --> 27:01.719
How about...

27:01.754 --> 27:04.121
if my project wins the fair,

27:04.156 --> 27:05.122
you promise

27:05.157 --> 27:07.358
to wear the rainbow socks
for the celebration?

27:07.393 --> 27:09.193
I can do that. But
you're calling the win already!

27:09.228 --> 27:11.629
I'm just saying if I win.

27:11.664 --> 27:12.463
Okay. What're we playing here?

27:12.498 --> 27:14.765
Paper dolls.
You can be the Dad doll.

27:14.800 --> 27:16.367
I can be the Dad doll.

27:16.402 --> 27:18.068
Yeah. And I can be
the Sophie doll.

27:18.104 --> 27:20.371
And, oh, who's that?
Is that Mrs. Carlyle?

27:20.406 --> 27:21.939
It's the Mom doll.

27:21.974 --> 27:24.475
We still need someone
to play her.

27:25.645 --> 27:28.345
We do, do we?

27:36.555 --> 27:37.955
[Lucy]:
And then I ran into him

27:37.990 --> 27:39.857
at the craft store with Dana,

27:39.892 --> 27:41.492
and wound up helping him
pick out supplies

27:41.527 --> 27:44.161
for Sophie's
science fair project.

27:44.196 --> 27:45.195
This could be a sign.

27:45.231 --> 27:46.497
It's not "a sign."

27:46.532 --> 27:47.831
There's no signs.

27:47.867 --> 27:51.135
Oh, but these flowers
are gorgeous.

27:51.170 --> 27:52.803
I mean, look at these.
Oh, that pink.

27:52.838 --> 27:55.305
Oh, the smell is heavenly!

27:55.341 --> 27:56.774
Are you okay?

27:57.843 --> 27:58.909
Yeah!

27:58.944 --> 28:00.778
Yeah, I'm-- I'm good.

28:01.914 --> 28:03.013
I'm really good.

28:03.049 --> 28:05.482
I think I'm just gonna get
a couple bunches of these.

28:05.518 --> 28:06.650
They're just so gorgeous.

28:06.686 --> 28:07.985
Knock yourself out!

28:08.020 --> 28:09.086
[laughing]

28:17.763 --> 28:20.364

28:28.808 --> 28:30.107
[phone clatters on counter]

28:32.144 --> 28:34.211
[Lucy]: Great. Thank you.

28:34.246 --> 28:35.446
Yeah. You can
have whatever you want.

28:35.481 --> 28:36.280
Oh!

28:36.315 --> 28:37.514
[overlapping]: Hello!

28:37.550 --> 28:39.450
Are you guys stalking me?

28:39.485 --> 28:41.552
I'm pretty sure
you're stalking me.

28:41.587 --> 28:43.787
No, I actually come here
every Sunday--

28:43.823 --> 28:45.255
just me and some popcorn.

28:45.291 --> 28:46.890
You should come sit with us.

28:46.926 --> 28:49.359
Oh, no, Sophie,
I'm sure that Ms. Taylor

28:49.395 --> 28:50.694
wants to just relax
and enjoy the movie.

28:50.730 --> 28:52.796
No, no. Actually, I'd--
I'd love to.

28:53.866 --> 28:56.633
I certainly can't eat
all this popcorn by myself.

28:56.669 --> 29:00.037
Oh, well, we haven't
had dinner, so, uh...

29:00.072 --> 29:01.071
Yeah, it's a date.

29:02.174 --> 29:03.307
I mean...

29:03.342 --> 29:04.241
You know what I mean.

29:04.276 --> 29:05.642
Totally.

29:05.678 --> 29:06.944
Yeah. Right.

29:08.314 --> 29:10.280
Oh, we got perfect seats.

29:10.316 --> 29:12.382
Yeah. That's the thing
I love about this theater,

29:12.418 --> 29:13.417
it's kind of my little secret.

29:13.452 --> 29:15.119
Well, not anymore.

29:15.154 --> 29:17.321
[chuckles
as text alert chimes]

29:17.356 --> 29:19.423
Going to try the candy?

29:25.664 --> 29:26.597
Soda?

29:26.632 --> 29:27.631
Yeah.

29:27.666 --> 29:29.433
Thanks.

29:33.672 --> 29:34.605
Sorry.

29:34.640 --> 29:36.106
No. Ladies first.

29:36.142 --> 29:37.541
Don't mind if I do.

29:39.378 --> 29:40.611
-[both laughing]
-Go.

29:40.646 --> 29:42.679
Okay. It's my turn.
There we go.

29:52.057 --> 29:54.024
That looks really good.
Nice job.

29:54.860 --> 29:56.460
[Lucy]: Oh, wow.
I love all the color.

29:59.165 --> 30:00.764
Hey, Sophie.

30:00.800 --> 30:02.132
Hi.

30:02.168 --> 30:03.300
You've been putting
in a lot of work here

30:03.335 --> 30:05.135
with your science project.

30:05.171 --> 30:07.604
Yeah, I like to create things at
home, so.

30:07.640 --> 30:11.208
Well, your hard work shows.
Nice job.

30:11.243 --> 30:13.977
[text alert chimes]

30:19.718 --> 30:22.853
Uh, class, keep working.
I'll be right back, okay?

30:27.960 --> 30:29.226
You didn't respond to my text.

30:29.261 --> 30:30.527
I was in the movies.

30:30.563 --> 30:32.129
So? Well?

30:32.164 --> 30:33.230
So I went to the movies

30:33.265 --> 30:34.798
and ran into Jack
and sat with him.

30:34.834 --> 30:35.833
This is great!

30:35.868 --> 30:37.000
-Is it great, though?

30:37.036 --> 30:39.336
I mean,
I'm his daughter's teacher.

30:39.371 --> 30:40.537
It could be weird.

30:40.573 --> 30:41.505
I don't think it's weird.

30:41.540 --> 30:42.673
How did it end?

30:42.708 --> 30:45.142
With "goodbye."

30:45.177 --> 30:47.044
Like, "goodbye"?
Or like...

30:47.079 --> 30:48.345
<i> goodbye?</i>

30:49.381 --> 30:50.647
I have to get back to class.

30:50.683 --> 30:52.115
Don't leave!
This is so exciting!

30:53.219 --> 30:55.085
<i> Goodbye.</i>

30:56.155 --> 30:58.322
I knew it!

30:58.357 --> 31:00.757
That's my girl.

31:04.396 --> 31:06.730
[Jack whistling jovially]

31:11.036 --> 31:12.236
[stops whistling]

31:12.271 --> 31:13.503
Something's different.

31:13.539 --> 31:15.472
Yeah, we're getting work done.

31:15.507 --> 31:16.840
No, not that, about you.

31:16.876 --> 31:18.242
You're... whistling.

31:18.277 --> 31:19.943
I like to whistle.

31:19.979 --> 31:22.079
[chuckles] No, no, no.
You're a terrible whistler.

31:22.114 --> 31:23.213
I have guy-dar about stuff.

31:23.249 --> 31:24.882
My wife says
it's my men's intuition.

31:24.917 --> 31:26.216
Thank you.

31:26.252 --> 31:27.951
I don't think that's a thing.

31:27.987 --> 31:29.219
Tell that
to my Spidey senses.

31:29.255 --> 31:31.722
They are screaming at me
right now.

31:31.757 --> 31:33.557
It's a beautiful day
in Ocean Hill.

31:33.592 --> 31:34.791
That's reason enough to whistle.

31:34.827 --> 31:36.393
No, no. That's not it.

31:36.428 --> 31:37.694
Your energy is shouting at me.

31:37.730 --> 31:40.063
It's like "Whoo!"
Something big happened.

31:40.099 --> 31:41.932
Look, we are not
having this conversation.

31:41.967 --> 31:43.233
We don't need to.
I've heard all I need to.

31:43.269 --> 31:45.535
I literally--
I have goose bumps right now.

31:45.571 --> 31:46.703
Are you from Earth?

[Lucy]: All right, class!

31:53.479 --> 31:56.380
Uh, remember, the science fair
projects are due next week.

31:56.415 --> 31:57.547
Okay? We'll work on them
more tomorrow,

31:57.583 --> 31:59.950
but make sure you guys
are thinking about 'em tonight.

32:01.453 --> 32:03.287
-Bye, Sophie.
-Bye, Maya.

Hey, there.

Oh! Hey.

32:10.629 --> 32:12.930
Hey, look at me--
on time for a change.

32:12.965 --> 32:15.999
I got off work early.
Kevin is covering for me.

32:16.035 --> 32:17.567
I'm actually being
a little bit truant.

32:17.603 --> 32:18.735
Sounds dangerous.

32:18.771 --> 32:20.570
-Yeah, that's me.
-[Lucy laughs]

32:20.606 --> 32:22.172
-Hi, Dad.
-Hey, sweetie. You all set?

32:22.207 --> 32:23.273
Yeah, almost.

32:23.309 --> 32:24.908
Oh! Excuse me. Sorry.

32:24.944 --> 32:25.909
Oh, yeah.

32:25.945 --> 32:29.513
Yep. Hey, Kevin, what's up?

32:29.548 --> 32:31.815
Uh, nope, the plans
are right on my desk,

32:31.850 --> 32:33.183
like I showed you.

32:36.188 --> 32:37.654
Oh. Yeah. Okay.

32:37.690 --> 32:39.323
I got you. Um...

32:39.358 --> 32:40.457
I'll see you soon.

32:40.492 --> 32:42.893
Is everything okay?

32:42.928 --> 32:44.027
Looks like Kevin
is not covering for me.

32:44.063 --> 32:45.128
I have to go back to work.

32:45.164 --> 32:46.797
And...

32:46.832 --> 32:48.465
I let the babysitter go.

32:49.501 --> 32:50.934
Okay. You.

32:50.970 --> 32:53.437
You're coming to work
with Daddy.

32:53.472 --> 32:55.172
But I need
to work on my project.

32:55.207 --> 32:56.606
I'm sorry, sweetie,
I have no other choice.

32:56.642 --> 32:59.142
Uh, you know what?
Actually, I could watch her.

32:59.178 --> 33:00.811
Oh, no, I'm not gonna
put you out like that.

33:00.846 --> 33:03.814
It's really no problem at all.
I wouldn't mind.

33:03.849 --> 33:05.816
And I could help you
with your project,

33:05.851 --> 33:07.651
and we can make some dinner.

33:07.686 --> 33:09.152
And I can be your sous chef.

33:09.188 --> 33:10.620
Perfect.

33:10.656 --> 33:11.822
Um, you're sure it's okay?

33:11.857 --> 33:12.956
Absolutely.

33:12.992 --> 33:14.191
It really helps me out.

33:14.226 --> 33:15.826
Sophie, give her my number,

33:15.861 --> 33:16.893
and then you text me
your address.

-Yes, I will.
-Okay.

All right,
you got all your stuff?

-Yeah.
-Okay, let me pack all this up.

33:28.007 --> 33:30.307
The secret to eating garlic
is to make sure

33:30.342 --> 33:32.142
that everybody around you
is eating it, too.

So you're not
the only one who stinks.

33:34.380 --> 33:35.746
Exactly.

33:35.781 --> 33:37.114
How are those veggies coming?

33:37.149 --> 33:39.182
Almost done.

Do you and your dad
get to do this a lot?

You've got to try it.

while I drain these noodles?

-Yeah.
-Perfect.

Hi, Dad.

-Hi, sweetie. Hi.
-Come on in.

Well...

-How's it going?
-Good.

Oh, it smells delicious.

34:24.997 --> 34:27.431
Well, we have been
working very hard at dinner,

34:27.466 --> 34:29.299
and Sophie makes
an excellent sous chef.

34:29.334 --> 34:31.368
That's my girl.

34:31.403 --> 34:33.437
I hope you guys
can stay for dinner?

34:34.406 --> 34:35.405
We would love to.

34:36.508 --> 34:39.576
Great. I'll just, uh,
finish this stuff up.

34:39.611 --> 34:41.144
Dad, can I show you my project?

34:41.180 --> 34:42.179
Yes.

34:43.749 --> 34:45.449
Ooh! What do we have here?

34:45.484 --> 34:47.217
Okay. Ready?

34:47.252 --> 34:48.418
Yeah.

34:51.256 --> 34:53.757
Ooh. Fun. You made this
all by yourself, honey?

34:53.792 --> 34:54.925
Yeah.

34:54.960 --> 34:55.826
I'm probably gonna add something

34:55.861 --> 34:57.761
that turns it,
or lights or something.

34:57.796 --> 34:59.129
Look at you.

We have another engineer
in the family.

35:13.512 --> 35:15.178
Uh, what're you doing--?

35:15.214 --> 35:18.281
I was in the neighborhood
and wanted to surprise you,

35:18.317 --> 35:19.483
so I brought us dessert.

35:19.518 --> 35:21.485
-Uh, yeah, uh--
-Your place is nice.

Yeah, Ben, this is, uh,
my student, Sophie,

35:29.094 --> 35:30.961

Yeah, we were just about to--

35:33.365 --> 35:35.031
We were just leaving,
actually.

35:35.067 --> 35:36.633
No, we weren't, Dad.

35:36.668 --> 35:38.802
No, you guys
don't have to leave.

35:38.837 --> 35:41.104
Yeah, no, no, no.
We should really get home.

tomorrow,

35:43.142 --> 35:44.841

35:44.877 --> 35:46.143
You two should just
enjoy your dinner together.

35:46.178 --> 35:47.244
No, Jack, please,

35:47.279 --> 35:49.346
let me at least send you guys
home with some food.

35:49.381 --> 35:50.714
No, no, no. Really.
That's too kind.

35:50.749 --> 35:52.048
No, really, I insist.

35:52.084 --> 35:54.251
Let me get it for you.

35:58.824 --> 36:00.690
Really, thank you so much again
for helping with Sophie.

36:00.726 --> 36:02.225
[Lucy]:
Absolutely, my pleasure.

36:02.261 --> 36:05.195
And thank you for all your help
tonight, Sophie.

36:05.230 --> 36:06.129
Bye, Ms. Taylor.

36:06.165 --> 36:07.230
[Lucy]: All right.
I'll see you tomorrow.

36:07.266 --> 36:08.431
Goodnight.

36:08.467 --> 36:11.735
Uh, so I'll see you at running,
I guess.

36:11.770 --> 36:13.003
Right!

36:13.038 --> 36:14.337
Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.

36:14.373 --> 36:15.805
Yeah, I'm looking forward
to working this off.

36:15.841 --> 36:17.541
All right. Well, enjoy.

36:17.576 --> 36:18.708
-Take care.
-Bye, Jack.

36:23.515 --> 36:24.514
Yeah.

36:31.023 --> 36:32.789
[Lucy]: Please, dig in.
There's tons.

36:32.824 --> 36:34.457
And you have to have
some of the garlic bread.

36:34.493 --> 36:36.960
I can't eat it by myself.
That's the rule.

36:36.995 --> 36:39.462
I try to keep
my gluten intake to a minimum.

36:39.498 --> 36:41.431
I just saw
this whole documentary.

36:42.701 --> 36:45.135
Ah. Must've missed that one.

36:45.170 --> 36:46.836
Yeah, it's on
the Guatemalan bean,

36:46.872 --> 36:49.439
but it discusses how
wheat is slowly killing us.

36:49.474 --> 36:51.474
It's very informative.
I know you'd love it.

36:51.510 --> 36:54.778
Would I, though?
I mean, would I love it?

36:54.813 --> 36:55.979
Sorry?

36:57.349 --> 36:59.783
Look, Ben,
I really appreciate you coming.

36:59.818 --> 37:01.284
You're welcome.

37:01.320 --> 37:04.154
Yeah, and you're lovely.

37:04.189 --> 37:06.122
And very passionate
about beans--

37:06.158 --> 37:08.091
Thank you.

37:08.126 --> 37:10.093
I just don't see us, really,

37:10.128 --> 37:13.196
as being anything more
than just friends.

37:15.667 --> 37:18.702
I'm so sorry.

37:20.405 --> 37:24.641
[♪♪♪]

37:38.857 --> 37:42.492
[♪♪♪]

37:42.527 --> 37:43.660
[Jack]: Hey! Lucy!

37:43.695 --> 37:44.694
Wait up!

37:44.730 --> 37:45.695
Good pace today.

37:45.731 --> 37:47.731
Thank you.

37:47.766 --> 37:48.999
Want to take
a little breather?

37:49.034 --> 37:50.600
Yeah.

37:50.636 --> 37:51.668
Yeah, I could use it.

37:51.703 --> 37:52.535
Good.

37:52.571 --> 37:54.037
It's gorgeous down here, huh?

37:54.072 --> 37:55.305
I know.

37:55.340 --> 37:58.375
Hey, uh, I'm really sorry
about the other night.

37:58.410 --> 37:59.809
What? Why?

37:59.845 --> 38:02.545
No, that was the best meal
we've had in ages.

38:02.581 --> 38:04.481
Sophie and I
literally arm-wrestled

38:04.516 --> 38:06.950
over who got
the last piece of garlic toast.

38:06.985 --> 38:08.685
Oh. Who won?

38:08.720 --> 38:10.387
-Sophie... obviously.
-[Lucy laughs]

38:10.422 --> 38:13.256
Oh, she's got
super-human strength, that one.

38:13.292 --> 38:14.257
Yeah!

38:14.293 --> 38:16.526
[Jack sighs]

38:17.529 --> 38:18.662
So, uh...

38:18.697 --> 38:20.964
Ben... seems nice.

38:20.999 --> 38:23.433
No. It's...

38:23.468 --> 38:25.368
it's not like that.

38:25.404 --> 38:26.503
It's not?

38:26.538 --> 38:27.504
No.

38:27.539 --> 38:29.339
It's none of my business.

38:29.374 --> 38:30.407
We're just friends.

38:33.045 --> 38:34.577
Does he know that?

38:35.714 --> 38:37.080
He does now.
[laughs]

38:37.115 --> 38:38.114
Ooh... ow.

38:38.150 --> 38:40.116
Yeah.

38:41.219 --> 38:43.953
My Mom's always says
I'm too picky, but...

38:43.989 --> 38:45.322
But?

38:45.357 --> 38:47.724
I guess I just, uh...

38:47.759 --> 38:49.926
I know what I want.

38:51.330 --> 38:53.229
Large coconut mocha,
extra whip?

38:53.265 --> 38:54.397
[laughs]

38:54.433 --> 38:55.432
Exactly.

38:55.467 --> 38:56.466
Oh, me too.

38:56.501 --> 38:58.802
The whip, oh!
It's my weakness.

38:58.837 --> 39:00.770
See, I like to think of it
as my strength.

39:00.806 --> 39:01.971
Huh.

39:02.007 --> 39:03.139
A good mocha...

39:03.175 --> 39:05.709
is the match
between bold and sweet.

39:05.744 --> 39:08.712
It's kind of
the perfect relationship.

39:08.747 --> 39:12.115
I guess you're the, uh,
the bold in this scenario?

39:12.150 --> 39:13.850
Obviously.

39:14.853 --> 39:19.489
[♪♪♪]

39:26.331 --> 39:27.430
Um...

39:27.466 --> 39:30.100
so I think we have officially...

39:30.135 --> 39:31.134
lost our group.

39:31.169 --> 39:33.336
Yes, it's, uh...

39:33.372 --> 39:35.004
it would seem that way.

39:35.040 --> 39:35.972
-Hmm.

39:36.007 --> 39:36.940
Ah, who needs 'em.

39:36.975 --> 39:38.608
Well, we do,
if we want to find our way back.

39:38.643 --> 39:40.376
Are we a left
or a right up here?

39:40.378 --> 39:41.478
I know how to get back.

39:41.480 --> 39:44.414
The marina's just up this way,
lighthouse is over there,

39:44.449 --> 39:46.316
and there's a great park
on the way.

39:46.351 --> 39:48.518
It's spectacular,
I'll show you.

39:48.553 --> 39:49.519
Great.

39:49.554 --> 39:50.487
All right.

39:50.522 --> 39:52.555
Come on... Jackie.

39:52.591 --> 39:54.924
-That's "Officer Jackie,"
to you, ma'am.

39:54.960 --> 39:55.925
[Lucy laughs]

39:55.961 --> 39:58.895
[♪♪♪]

40:05.003 --> 40:06.136
Do you have
a key for this?

40:06.171 --> 40:07.704
I don't need one.

40:07.739 --> 40:09.806
The gate's just to keep out
unwanted visitors.

40:09.841 --> 40:11.274
It's just a formality.

40:11.309 --> 40:13.410
Uh... and we're wanted?

40:13.445 --> 40:15.545
Absolutely!

40:18.283 --> 40:19.416
Hey.

40:19.451 --> 40:20.917
Come on in.

40:20.952 --> 40:23.353
-As long as I'm not gonna
get arrested.

40:23.388 --> 40:25.922
[chuckles] No. My family's
been coming here for years.

40:26.992 --> 40:28.992
You see, I know the guard.

40:29.027 --> 40:31.995
The trick is, you just
have to look up over here,

40:32.030 --> 40:33.029
at this little security camera,

40:33.064 --> 40:34.831
and wave.

40:34.866 --> 40:37.167
Say, "Hi, Stanley!"

40:37.202 --> 40:38.168
Perfect.

40:38.203 --> 40:39.235
[Jack chuckles]

40:39.271 --> 40:43.239
Wow. You weren't kidding.
It is an oasis in here.

40:43.275 --> 40:44.240
Yeah.

40:44.276 --> 40:47.343
Yeah, my parents actually
got married in here.

40:47.379 --> 40:50.346
They're celebrating
their 40th wedding anniversary.

40:50.382 --> 40:51.548
That's amazing.

40:51.583 --> 40:53.049
-Yeah. Right?
-Yeah.

40:53.084 --> 40:55.685
And my sister's about
to give birth.

40:55.720 --> 40:57.520
Is this her first?

40:57.556 --> 40:58.922
Yeah.

40:58.957 --> 41:01.691
Yeah, she and Brian have been
married for about 10 years

41:01.726 --> 41:04.494
and they tried
for a really long time.

41:04.529 --> 41:07.597
It just wasn't working,
so they just kind of gave up,

41:07.632 --> 41:10.066
and then this happened.

41:10.101 --> 41:12.569
Isn't that amazing
how that happens?

41:12.604 --> 41:15.104
Yeah, I know.

41:16.141 --> 41:17.507
[Jack exhales deeply]

41:17.542 --> 41:20.276
I can't wait
to be an auntie, though.

41:20.312 --> 41:23.279
Do you, uh, do you want
kids of your own someday?

41:23.315 --> 41:25.415
Yeah, someday.

41:25.450 --> 41:27.116
But you know how life goes.

41:27.152 --> 41:28.418
I mean,
you get busy with work,

41:28.453 --> 41:30.019
and all that.

41:30.055 --> 41:31.621
But don't get me wrong,
I mean, I love my students.

41:31.656 --> 41:33.957
Oh, no, I get it,

41:33.992 --> 41:36.793
but life has other plans
sometimes.

41:36.828 --> 41:38.027
Exactly.

41:38.063 --> 41:39.295
Yeah.

41:39.331 --> 41:40.530
Oh, wow.

41:40.565 --> 41:43.433
Look at this.

41:43.468 --> 41:46.736
This is a special spot.
You can feel it.

41:46.771 --> 41:48.771
Yeah, it really is.

41:52.477 --> 41:56.813
[♪♪♪]

42:02.687 --> 42:05.221
"For all the souls
who found their mates.

42:05.257 --> 42:06.656
Love Paul and Mary."

42:06.691 --> 42:07.690
[chuckles]

42:09.294 --> 42:11.794
Those are my parents.

42:11.830 --> 42:13.096
No?

42:13.131 --> 42:15.498
Yeah.

42:15.534 --> 42:17.267
[Jack]: That's so sweet.

42:17.302 --> 42:19.302
[Lucy]: Yeah, it is.

42:24.209 --> 42:27.110
I don't usually talk
this deeply with people,

42:27.145 --> 42:29.445
especially, uh...

42:29.481 --> 42:31.814
with people I barely know,
but...

42:34.853 --> 42:36.519
There's something...

42:39.391 --> 42:41.624
Well, I'm not one
for small talk.

42:41.660 --> 42:43.826
And most people are.

42:43.862 --> 42:45.995
I'm not most people.

42:46.031 --> 42:48.831
No, you most certainly
are not.

42:53.838 --> 42:55.838
You ever seen a moonbow?

42:55.874 --> 42:57.206
A "moonbow"?

42:57.242 --> 42:58.441
That's-- That's a thing?

42:58.476 --> 43:01.010
Yeah,
they're moonlight rainbows.

43:02.013 --> 43:05.381
I've only ever seen one,
and it was here.

43:05.417 --> 43:08.651
They're supposed to be
really good luck.

43:08.687 --> 43:11.154
And yet you claim
you're not lucky.

43:11.189 --> 43:12.622
[Lucy chuckles]

43:12.657 --> 43:14.857
Hmm. Interesting.

43:14.893 --> 43:16.059
-[text alert chimes]
-Oh.

43:17.596 --> 43:20.730
Ah. I'm supposed to go
to lunch with my family.

43:20.765 --> 43:24.000
Yeah, I should probably
get back to, um...

43:24.035 --> 43:25.568
Hey, listen.

43:25.604 --> 43:27.971
Sophie and I were thinking about
checking out town tomorrow,

43:28.006 --> 43:30.473
if you'd like to join us.

43:30.508 --> 43:32.408
I could be your tour guide.

43:32.444 --> 43:34.510
Well, no, you don't have to--
I wasn't saying...

43:34.546 --> 43:36.846
but if you'd like to come...

43:36.881 --> 43:38.615
I'd love to.

43:38.650 --> 43:40.950
It's a date.

43:40.986 --> 43:41.985
You know what I mean.

43:42.020 --> 43:43.553
Totally.

43:43.588 --> 43:45.755
[chuckles]

43:47.158 --> 43:49.626
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

43:49.661 --> 43:50.693
Where's Mom?

43:50.729 --> 43:51.694
Doing some errands.

43:51.730 --> 43:53.563
Where were you?

43:53.598 --> 43:56.099
I was with my running club.

43:56.134 --> 43:57.867
Still?

43:57.902 --> 44:01.237
You were with Jack.

44:01.272 --> 44:02.505
Who's Jack?

44:02.540 --> 44:05.108
He's just the father
of one of my students.

44:05.143 --> 44:06.075
[Paul]: Yeah?

44:06.111 --> 44:08.378
Please! He's a gorgeous guy

44:08.413 --> 44:11.214
who happens to be
perfect for Lucy.

44:11.249 --> 44:13.349
You don't even know him.

44:13.385 --> 44:14.584
And he's a Cubs fan.

44:14.619 --> 44:16.219
Oh, there's your problem
right there.

44:16.254 --> 44:17.854
Major league
or minor league?

44:17.889 --> 44:18.955
Definitely major.

44:18.990 --> 44:20.623
[Paul]: Ahh?

44:20.659 --> 44:23.226
He's the first guy in forever
to make you smile.

44:23.261 --> 44:24.260
[Paul chuckles]

44:24.295 --> 44:25.595
I smile all the time.

44:25.630 --> 44:27.630
[Paul laughs heartily]

44:27.666 --> 44:30.466
Well, that's wonderful,
sweetie.

44:30.502 --> 44:33.102
You know, I felt like
I hit a home run

44:33.138 --> 44:35.104
for the whole first year
I was with your mother.

44:35.140 --> 44:37.440
Heck, the first 10 years.

44:37.475 --> 44:39.275
Oh, so what happened?

44:39.310 --> 44:42.111
Nothin'.
Everything's great.

44:42.147 --> 44:43.980
Don't you miss the magic?

44:44.015 --> 44:45.748
After 40 years,

44:45.784 --> 44:47.684
ah, it's a different kind
of magic.

44:47.719 --> 44:48.985
I'm still
batting a thousand.

44:50.088 --> 44:52.755
Uh, maybe the problem's
all the baseball metaphors.

44:53.792 --> 44:54.924
Who said
there's a problem?

44:54.959 --> 44:57.060
Just... no problem.

44:57.095 --> 44:58.561
What, your mother
say something?

44:58.596 --> 44:59.429
No!

44:59.464 --> 45:01.097
No, not at all.

45:01.132 --> 45:04.734
But you know, everybody likes
some romance now and then.

45:04.769 --> 45:07.036
Especially from
a handsome charmer like you.

45:07.072 --> 45:08.971
Oh...
now I know you're lying.

45:09.007 --> 45:10.640
[girls laughing]

45:10.675 --> 45:13.443
Luce and I are planning a party
for your anniversary.

45:13.478 --> 45:15.478
-Oh?
-A surprise party.

45:15.513 --> 45:17.246
I just mean that...

45:17.282 --> 45:20.183
maybe you'd like to help us
plan something romantic.

45:20.218 --> 45:22.485
What, like a kiss cam
at a game?

45:22.520 --> 45:25.121
Maybe something
not baseball-related.

45:26.725 --> 45:28.057
She did say something,
didn't she?

45:28.093 --> 45:29.092
[Lucy]: You know what?

45:29.127 --> 45:31.327
Why don't you guys
renew your vows at the park?

45:31.362 --> 45:32.929
I was just there with Jack.

45:32.964 --> 45:34.831
You took Jack to the park?

45:36.234 --> 45:37.600
Whoa!

45:37.635 --> 45:38.568
[Paul chuckling]

45:38.603 --> 45:40.336
Definitely major league.

[♪♪♪]

45:54.819 --> 45:55.785
Hi, Ms. Taylor.

45:55.820 --> 45:57.186
Hey, Sophie!

45:57.222 --> 45:58.755
-Hi!
-Hey.

45:58.790 --> 46:00.022
Well, hello there.

46:00.058 --> 46:02.024
Well, hello,
and welcome to "Tours By Lucy."

46:02.060 --> 46:03.192
Oh, you are taking
this tour guide thing

46:03.228 --> 46:04.193
very seriously.

46:04.229 --> 46:05.628
I like it.

46:05.663 --> 46:07.063
So, what, I drive,
you be the navigator?

46:07.098 --> 46:08.264
Uh, no, actually,

46:08.299 --> 46:10.399
neither one of us
are gonna be driving today.

46:10.435 --> 46:12.635
Now, do you guys like hot dogs?

46:12.670 --> 46:15.037
Is that even a question?

46:15.073 --> 46:18.174

46:24.849 --> 46:29.585
[♪♪♪]

46:30.622 --> 46:31.754
[Lucy]: No, no, no, no.

46:31.790 --> 46:35.091
That's-- That's important.

46:35.126 --> 46:37.560
Well, so is this.

46:37.595 --> 46:39.095
And you got a little ketchup
on you.

46:39.130 --> 46:39.962
Yeah?

46:39.998 --> 46:40.897
No, no.

46:40.932 --> 46:41.964
Over here.

46:42.000 --> 46:44.200
Yeah. It's just everywhere.

46:45.236 --> 46:46.402
Where are we going?

46:46.437 --> 46:48.337
You'll find out.

46:48.373 --> 46:49.572
[Sophie]: Whoa.

46:49.607 --> 46:51.440
The aquarium?

46:51.476 --> 46:54.076
[Lucy]: Mm-hmm.

46:54.112 --> 46:56.979
[Jack]: This looks fun.

46:57.015 --> 46:59.782
[Lucy]: Just wait till you meet
Señor Sea Lion.

47:00.952 --> 47:03.953
[Jack]: Hey, now.

47:04.989 --> 47:06.956
-[Jack]: Hello!
-[Lucy]: Hi!

47:08.493 --> 47:10.760
Dad, can we keep him?
He's so cute.

47:10.795 --> 47:12.461
Uh... Oh, he's nodding.

47:12.497 --> 47:15.932
He's like, "Yeah, I want that.
I want that."

47:33.184 --> 47:34.717
Where are wee going?

47:34.752 --> 47:37.153
Just follow me.

47:37.188 --> 47:39.522
[Jack]: Oh, come on.

47:39.557 --> 47:40.723
-[Lucy]: Right?
-[Sophie]: Amazing!

47:41.893 --> 47:43.392
The air...

47:43.428 --> 47:45.628
It's like--it's like
a whole other world in here.

47:45.663 --> 47:46.863
I know.

47:46.898 --> 47:48.698
It's one of my favorite
places in the city.

47:48.733 --> 47:50.333
Oh, this feels good.

47:50.368 --> 47:52.501
I can just... mm.

47:52.537 --> 47:54.337
Relax?

47:54.372 --> 47:55.371
Yeah.

47:55.406 --> 47:56.906
It's so cool.

47:56.941 --> 47:58.241
If you think this is cool,

47:58.276 --> 48:00.443
wait till you see
what's up next.

48:06.017 --> 48:07.917
[Sophie]: Whoa...

48:07.952 --> 48:09.151
[Lucy chuckles]

48:09.187 --> 48:10.920
This is amazing.

48:10.955 --> 48:13.022
Right?

48:16.794 --> 48:19.996
This is amazing, Ms. Taylor.

48:20.031 --> 48:22.365
I thought you might like this.

48:22.400 --> 48:24.934
So I might've planned
this part of the day.

48:24.969 --> 48:27.370
Thank you.
It's great.

48:28.539 --> 48:30.539
Yeah.

48:33.645 --> 48:36.145
-She loves it.
-I know.

[♪♪♪]

48:49.861 --> 48:51.160
Goodnight.

48:51.195 --> 48:52.929
Goodnight, sweetheart.

48:55.934 --> 48:57.333
Sweet dreams.

48:57.368 --> 48:59.201
Goodnight, Ms. Taylor.

48:59.237 --> 49:01.237
Goodnight, Sophie.

49:08.579 --> 49:10.880
Well, um,
I should probably get going,

49:10.915 --> 49:12.481
it's getting kind of late.

49:12.517 --> 49:14.550
Yeah, uh, well, I...

49:14.585 --> 49:16.953
Do you want some tea?
I was gonna put a pot on.

49:17.956 --> 49:19.622
Um, yeah, you know what?
Sure.

49:19.657 --> 49:20.756
-Yeah?
-Maybe a small mug.

49:20.792 --> 49:22.858
Great.

49:24.662 --> 49:27.096
Your house is--
is really beautiful.

49:27.131 --> 49:29.131
Thanks. Uh, yeah.

49:29.167 --> 49:31.934
We haven't really turned it
into a home yet, as you can see.

49:31.970 --> 49:34.170
We're still unpacking
a little bit,

49:34.205 --> 49:39.709
but, yeah,
it's, um, starting to...

49:40.812 --> 49:42.611
...grow on me.

49:42.647 --> 49:45.982
Well, Ocean Hill sort of
has that effect on people.

49:50.121 --> 49:52.221
I can see that.

49:55.994 --> 49:58.661
Thank you for today.

49:58.696 --> 50:01.664
That was, um,
that was fun.

50:01.699 --> 50:05.034
Yeah. Yeah, it was fun.

50:06.971 --> 50:08.471

50:12.377 --> 50:15.644
Kevin
with his impeccable timing.

50:15.680 --> 50:18.514
Well, it's been a while,
he's probably worried.

50:18.549 --> 50:19.348
Well, yeah, right.

50:19.384 --> 50:20.316
And you know what?

50:20.351 --> 50:21.684
I should really go.

50:21.719 --> 50:22.852
-You know, I can just--
-Yeah. No.

50:22.887 --> 50:24.220
It's fine, 'cause, you know,

50:24.255 --> 50:26.222
we've got a big day tomorrow
with the science fair.

50:26.257 --> 50:28.991
Yeah, and I am
building a bridge.

50:29.027 --> 50:30.259
Exactly.

50:34.365 --> 50:36.465
I'll see you to the door.

50:36.501 --> 50:37.533
Why, thank you.

50:37.568 --> 50:39.001
Mm-hmm.

50:39.037 --> 50:41.303
Well...

50:41.339 --> 50:43.973
Well, thanks again
and drive safe.

50:44.008 --> 50:45.474
-Yeah, absolutely.
-Sorry.

50:45.510 --> 50:46.475
-Are we--
-Yeah.

50:46.511 --> 50:48.044
Goodnight, Jack.

51:08.232 --> 51:10.733
All right, everyone,
your projects look amazing.

51:10.768 --> 51:11.634
I want you to know,

51:11.669 --> 51:14.036
I-I see how hard you guys
have all worked.

51:14.072 --> 51:16.605
So just remember,
no matter who wins here today,

51:16.641 --> 51:19.241
you guys all did
an amazing job, all right?

51:19.277 --> 51:20.943
Hey, Soph. You ready?

51:20.978 --> 51:24.246
Yeah, but my dad's
not here yet.

51:24.282 --> 51:26.882
I'm sure
he'll be here any minute, okay?

51:28.586 --> 51:29.919
[Jack]: I can't believe
we pulled it off.

51:29.954 --> 51:30.920
[Kevin]:
Well, you, my friend,

51:30.955 --> 51:31.854
need to give yourself
a little more credit.

51:31.889 --> 51:32.888
And me.

51:32.924 --> 51:34.356
You need to give me
more credit.

51:34.392 --> 51:37.560
It pains me to say this...
you're right.

51:37.595 --> 51:40.229
Of course I am.
About what?

51:41.899 --> 51:44.767
Everything's starting
to make sense.

51:44.802 --> 51:46.669
Whoa, wait a second.

51:46.704 --> 51:48.871
Does that teacher have
something to do with this?

51:48.906 --> 51:50.206
Wink-wink, nudge-nudge.

51:50.241 --> 51:51.107
Yeah. Oh, speaking of which,

51:51.142 --> 51:53.909
I got the science fair
this afternoon.

51:53.945 --> 51:54.810
I gotta--

51:54.846 --> 51:56.479
Science fair. Teacher.
Okay, I get it.

51:56.514 --> 51:57.379
-Thanks.
-Hey, bring an apple.

51:57.415 --> 51:58.814
-Oh, stop.
-Kinda cliche, but charming.

51:58.850 --> 52:00.483
[Brad]: Jack?

52:02.086 --> 52:03.786
Have you got a minute?

52:03.821 --> 52:07.123
Um, yeah.
Sure, Brad. What's up?

52:07.158 --> 52:10.326
Well, you have done
a stellar job, Jack.

52:10.361 --> 52:11.560
Very impressive.

52:11.596 --> 52:12.795
Well, thank you.

52:12.830 --> 52:14.630
Yeah, it went pretty smoothly.

52:14.665 --> 52:17.133
Doesn't... [chuckles]
...always go that way.

52:17.168 --> 52:18.400
Boy, don't I know it.

52:18.436 --> 52:22.471
Listen, I know
the small town of Ocean Hill

52:22.507 --> 52:25.241
wasn't exactly
your first choice--

52:25.276 --> 52:26.909
Oh, well, you know,
it's, uh...

52:26.944 --> 52:29.478
An offer has come through for
a position at our Miami firm.

52:29.514 --> 52:31.080
Might be right up your alley.

52:31.115 --> 52:34.116
I figured, before you dug in
your roots too deeply,

52:34.152 --> 52:35.918
as much as I'd hate
to lose you,

52:35.953 --> 52:39.021
this'll give you a chance
to choose where you want to be.

52:39.056 --> 52:41.056
Offer's yours.

52:42.326 --> 52:44.660
[♪♪♪]

52:51.302 --> 52:52.468
Like I was saying,

52:52.503 --> 52:55.237
people don't like to compost
because of the yucky smells.

52:55.273 --> 52:56.906
Clean compost
makes no smells.

52:56.941 --> 52:58.841
Try it.

53:00.278 --> 53:02.411
[all sniffing]

53:02.446 --> 53:04.780
Hmm!

53:04.815 --> 53:06.382
Good work, Ryan.

53:06.417 --> 53:08.384
Thank you.

53:09.420 --> 53:12.721
So, finally, we have
a... Sophie Evans?

53:12.757 --> 53:14.557
Hey, Sophie?

53:14.592 --> 53:15.558
You ready?

53:15.593 --> 53:17.560
My dad's still not here.

53:17.595 --> 53:20.596
We don't have time to wait,
but just know that I'm here.

53:20.631 --> 53:21.830
All right? Okay.

53:21.866 --> 53:24.700
Uh, Maya, will you help her
put her project up?

53:24.735 --> 53:25.935
Thank you.

53:28.105 --> 53:30.773
[♪♪♪]

53:38.282 --> 53:39.748
Just a minute.

53:49.760 --> 53:52.328
Rainbows are proof
magic exists.

53:52.363 --> 53:54.063
They are made by light

53:54.098 --> 53:55.631
and, like us,

53:55.666 --> 53:57.600
they don't light up
on their own.

53:57.635 --> 53:59.802
We need someone to spark us...

53:59.837 --> 54:01.937
[♪♪♪]

54:03.541 --> 54:05.007
...a friend,

54:05.042 --> 54:06.508
a teacher...

54:11.215 --> 54:13.182
...or a parent.

54:13.217 --> 54:14.516
-Hi.
-You made it.

54:14.552 --> 54:16.452
Yeah.

54:16.487 --> 54:18.921
My project,
"Chasing Rainbows,"

54:18.956 --> 54:22.291
is to show you
life is full of magic.

54:22.326 --> 54:24.960
You just have to look for it.

54:26.597 --> 54:28.130
It seems like magic.

54:28.165 --> 54:30.599
The light actually bends
when it moves through a prism

54:30.635 --> 54:33.435
and becomes separated into
different-color wavelengths,

54:33.471 --> 54:34.837
creating a rainbow.

54:36.407 --> 54:38.474
And if you can't find rainbows,

54:38.509 --> 54:39.675
create them.

54:42.013 --> 54:43.479
With a little belief,

54:43.514 --> 54:45.314
and help from others,

54:45.349 --> 54:47.049
maybe you can
light the whole world.

[hushed deliberations]

55:05.269 --> 55:08.170
We have a winner.

55:08.205 --> 55:11.006
For the most colorful display
we've seen in years...

55:11.042 --> 55:12.875
the first prize

55:12.910 --> 55:15.511
goes to Sophie Evans
for "Chasing Rainbows!"

55:15.546 --> 55:17.846
[cheering]

55:21.118 --> 55:21.984
[Sophie]: You made it!

55:22.019 --> 55:22.951
Of course!

55:22.987 --> 55:23.986
I wouldn't miss it
for the world, sweetie.

55:24.021 --> 55:25.988
Congratulations!

55:26.023 --> 55:27.356
Oh! And look. Huh?

55:27.391 --> 55:28.991
Man of my word.

55:29.026 --> 55:31.727
And I gotta say,
I kind of dig 'em.

55:31.762 --> 55:32.995
-Good job. Soph.
-Thank you.

55:33.030 --> 55:35.331
So I was thinking,

55:35.366 --> 55:39.635
I happen to know
the best hot dog joint in town.

55:39.670 --> 55:40.703
Oh?

55:40.738 --> 55:43.605
I was think we could
all go there and celebrate.

55:43.641 --> 55:45.341
I would love to,

55:45.376 --> 55:47.876
but my parents' anniversary
party is tonight,

55:47.912 --> 55:49.111
so I can't make it.

55:49.146 --> 55:51.180
Unless you guys
want to come to that?

55:51.215 --> 55:53.082
Oh, no, no. Thanks.
We don't want to impose.

55:53.117 --> 55:56.385
But we will definitely
take a raincheck. Right?

55:56.420 --> 55:58.087
Yeah. Absolutely.

55:58.122 --> 56:00.122
I want to see
your project again.

56:00.157 --> 56:01.256
Okay.

56:01.292 --> 56:03.092
-Thank you.
-Of course.

56:03.127 --> 56:04.526
[Jack]: Okay, give it
to me again.

56:04.562 --> 56:06.628
[♪♪♪]

56:06.664 --> 56:10.265
Oh! I can see the rainbows
on your face.

56:11.669 --> 56:13.202
[Mary]:
Where are we going?

56:13.237 --> 56:16.071
[Dana]: Mom, if we say,
it wouldn't be a surprise.

56:16.107 --> 56:18.207
[Mary]:
I feel overdressed.

56:18.242 --> 56:20.642
[Lucy]:
Mom, you look gorgeous.

56:22.179 --> 56:24.113
-What's going on?
-You'll see!

Where's Brian going?
