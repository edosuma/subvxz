**

00:10.367 --> 00:12.433
Why don't I get
a fucking letter?

00:12.500 --> 00:13.900
Chris: You're spending
a fair amount of time

00:13.967 --> 00:16.300
in my house
with my son,

00:16.367 --> 00:18.033
and I don't care for it.

00:18.100 --> 00:20.133
Blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah.

00:20.200 --> 00:21.533
[indistinct]

00:21.600 --> 00:24.533
**

00:29.767 --> 00:31.333
I'm sorry.

00:38.700 --> 00:39.900
Are you serious?

00:39.967 --> 00:41.300
What?

00:41.367 --> 00:43.100
- Take it off.
- No. What's wrong with it?

00:43.167 --> 00:44.767
What's wrong with it?
It's a turtleneck.

00:44.833 --> 00:46.233
Well, all my ties
are in Spain,

00:46.300 --> 00:48.033
and if I wear a jacket
and a shirt without a tie,

00:48.100 --> 00:49.800
I just look like
Ahmadinejad.

00:49.867 --> 00:51.233
- He's handsome.
- No, he isn't.

00:51.300 --> 00:53.567
Where'd you even find
a turtleneck, anyway?

00:53.633 --> 00:54.633
It's one of Dad's.

00:54.700 --> 00:55.667
So bury it with him.

00:59.867 --> 01:02.467
Anybody need to
empty the tank
before we go?

01:02.533 --> 01:04.567
**

01:09.533 --> 01:10.600
Fergal: Hey.

01:10.667 --> 01:11.567
Hey!

01:11.633 --> 01:13.333
Can you bend your knees
or something?

01:13.400 --> 01:15.167
- Huh?
- Just try and stoop down
a little.

01:15.233 --> 01:17.933
- It's just hard to--
- Sure. Yeah.

01:18.000 --> 01:21.100
[bell tolling]

01:21.900 --> 01:24.000
You look lovely.

01:24.067 --> 01:25.267
Should wear black
more often.

01:25.333 --> 01:27.967
I wear it a lot now,
but thanks.

01:28.033 --> 01:29.633
You look like
a motorcycle assassin.

01:32.900 --> 01:36.767
- I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

01:36.833 --> 01:38.000
Sorry.

01:41.100 --> 01:43.533
Ah, no. No.

01:48.167 --> 01:49.433
Okay.
That's enough now.

01:55.100 --> 01:57.267
Now is the hard time,

01:57.333 --> 01:59.667
but it's
supposed to be hard.

01:59.733 --> 02:03.400
When I lost Chris,
I thought I would never--

02:03.467 --> 02:05.000
Point is,
it gets easier.

02:06.633 --> 02:08.100
I'm here for you.

02:11.033 --> 02:13.633
[indistinct chatter]

02:13.700 --> 02:16.800
- How you holdin' up?
- What do you mean by that?

02:16.867 --> 02:18.800
I mean,
is my friend Rob okay?

02:18.867 --> 02:20.267
Yeah, I'm okay,

02:20.333 --> 02:23.367
'cause the situation dictates
that I be okay.

02:23.433 --> 02:24.600
My wife
just lost her father,

02:24.667 --> 02:26.400
and I'm rising to
the challenge

02:26.467 --> 02:29.567
'cause I'm not a fuckin' wino
who lives under a bridge

02:29.633 --> 02:30.800
like you think I am.

02:30.867 --> 02:33.567
Are you sure, because the
Metropolitan police reported

02:33.633 --> 02:36.333
a Bigfoot type
shoveling McNuggets
into his gob

02:36.400 --> 02:37.867
under the Vauxhall
bypass.

02:37.933 --> 02:39.367
[chuckles]

02:41.100 --> 02:42.700
Okay.

02:42.767 --> 02:43.967
Room for one more?

02:44.033 --> 02:46.300
Oh, uh, Mia,
I think your car is, uh--

02:46.367 --> 02:47.900
- There's a space.
- Yeah, but Rob is gonna--

02:47.967 --> 02:51.367
- Oh.
- Well, I think Rob's--

02:51.433 --> 02:54.300
I, um--
I'm just gonna go, uh--

02:54.367 --> 02:57.200
I-- I forgot my wreath.
I'm just--

02:58.467 --> 02:59.433
[sighs]

03:01.267 --> 03:03.233
That guy,
farmer face,

03:03.300 --> 03:04.567
you know,
the one with the...

03:04.633 --> 03:06.333
rosacea cauliflower nose.

03:06.400 --> 03:08.167
- Frank.
- Whatever.

03:08.233 --> 03:11.033
You need to know that
that display

03:11.100 --> 03:13.167
had nothing to do with Des,

03:13.233 --> 03:16.167
and everything to do with
getting into your pants.

03:17.900 --> 03:19.400
You've still got it.

03:21.100 --> 03:22.467
It was really
nice of you guys
to come over.

03:22.533 --> 03:24.933
Oh, well, we were in
the neighborhood, so--

03:25.000 --> 03:25.933
How you feelin'?

03:26.000 --> 03:27.167
Yeah, good.

03:27.233 --> 03:28.400
Well, obviously,
I'm-- I'm not good,

03:28.467 --> 03:30.367
I'm fuckin' terrible.
Yeah.

03:30.433 --> 03:32.833
My dad's dead but
there's just been
too much going on

03:32.900 --> 03:36.333
to be--
I do think it's weird that
I'm not feeling sad yet.

03:36.400 --> 03:37.867
Is it? I mean,
it's just--

03:37.933 --> 03:40.267
It's a lot of, you know,
organizing the funeral,

03:40.333 --> 03:43.267
and Mum, and keeping
an eye on Mum and--

03:43.333 --> 03:44.567
Just gettin'
the sandwiches.

03:44.633 --> 03:46.833
Oh, I took care of
the sandwiches.

03:46.900 --> 03:49.167
Oh. Great.

03:49.233 --> 03:52.267
[sobbing]
Oh. Sorry.

03:52.333 --> 03:53.533
- It's just--
- No, it's-- it's okay.

03:53.600 --> 03:55.033
I'm glad
someone's crying.

03:55.100 --> 03:56.533
It's just funerals.

03:56.600 --> 04:00.467
They bring everything up to
the surface, you know.

04:00.533 --> 04:01.733
[blowing]

04:01.800 --> 04:02.933
Sorry.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.133
Douglas dumped me

04:05.200 --> 04:06.600
just out of the blue.

04:06.667 --> 04:08.133
He just evaporated.

04:08.200 --> 04:11.000
I looked it up.
It's called ghosting.

04:11.067 --> 04:13.067
It started in
California.

04:13.133 --> 04:14.067
- It's when--
- Yeah, I know what it is.

04:14.133 --> 04:15.767
I know what it is.

04:15.833 --> 04:20.900
Oh, it just seems like
everything is terrible
for everyone right now.

04:20.967 --> 04:24.067
**

04:29.533 --> 04:32.267
Kate:
Thought a few more of your exes
might show their faces today.

04:32.333 --> 04:34.167
Connor Verne,
at least.

04:34.233 --> 04:36.033
He was almost part of
the family once.

04:36.100 --> 04:38.500
- No, he wasn't.
- May he rest in peace.

04:38.567 --> 04:39.867
What?
Connor Verne's dead?

04:39.933 --> 04:41.533
That's terrible.

04:41.600 --> 04:44.067
He fingered me
the night before my
leaving certificate.

04:44.133 --> 04:46.467
Then told everyone
that was why I passed.

04:46.533 --> 04:48.233
He knew what
he was doing,
though,

04:48.300 --> 04:49.667
for such a young lad.

04:49.733 --> 04:52.067
- How'd he die?
- Uh, I-- I don't know.

04:52.133 --> 04:54.833
I mean, if I was to guess
I'd say heart disease.

04:54.900 --> 04:56.500
Or finger cancer.

04:56.567 --> 04:58.100
[cell phone rings]

04:58.167 --> 05:00.033
- Hey.
- Dave: Hey,
can you talk?

05:00.100 --> 05:01.600
Uh, actually,
I'm in the middle of a--

05:01.667 --> 05:03.567
So, listen,
I think I might have
made a mistake.

05:03.633 --> 05:07.900
Um, I offered Catherine money
not to have the baby.

05:07.967 --> 05:09.200
Oh, Jesus.

05:09.267 --> 05:10.433
I want the baby
to be happy,

05:10.500 --> 05:12.467
so I thought
the best way to do that

05:12.533 --> 05:14.100
would be for it
to not be born.

05:14.167 --> 05:16.567
Wow. What'd she say
to that?

05:16.633 --> 05:18.367
She said get out of
my Range Rover.

05:18.433 --> 05:20.367
Yeah, well, you know how
women don't want men

05:20.433 --> 05:22.300
telling them they can't
have an abortion?

05:22.367 --> 05:24.767
I don't think they
like you to encourage them
to have one, either.

05:24.833 --> 05:27.033
Yeah. Pretty sure
I've done the wrong thing.

05:27.100 --> 05:28.467
All right, well, listen,
I gotta go.

05:28.533 --> 05:30.700
I'm at-- I'm at
Sharon's dad's funeral.

05:30.767 --> 05:32.000
What?

05:32.067 --> 05:33.767
Oh, my God,
that's so sad.

05:33.833 --> 05:35.200
I'm so sorry.
Um--

05:35.267 --> 05:37.833
Could you give me
the address so I can send

05:37.900 --> 05:39.600
a Edible Arrangement
or something?

05:39.667 --> 05:41.267
I don't know the address,
it's Ireland.

05:41.333 --> 05:42.733
Houses don't have numbers.

05:42.800 --> 05:45.667
It's the one by the limestone
jutting out of the bog.

05:45.733 --> 05:47.600
I don't know,
fuckin' Dingleberry Lane.

05:48.767 --> 05:51.267
- Hey. Who was that?
- Uh, sorry. Dave.

05:51.333 --> 05:53.467
- [cell phone chimes]
- He sends his love.

05:53.533 --> 05:55.633
[sighs]
Fuck's sake.

05:55.700 --> 05:57.200
[chiming]

05:59.300 --> 06:00.533
God love him.

06:00.600 --> 06:02.467
And no disrespect
to your mother.

06:02.533 --> 06:03.833
We have to get that woman
away from Mum.

06:03.900 --> 06:05.400
She's too weak
to help herself.

06:07.267 --> 06:10.767
- [clears throat]
- Mia: Ah. So...

06:10.833 --> 06:12.933
this is where
it all began.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.067
What?

06:14.133 --> 06:15.433
Riverdance.

06:16.700 --> 06:18.733
It was a lovely song
your cousin sang.

06:18.800 --> 06:20.700
Yeah. I mean,
it went on a bit,
but, yeah.

06:20.767 --> 06:22.367
Do you think he
wrote it special?

06:22.433 --> 06:24.267
I think Tracey Chapman
wrote it special,

06:24.333 --> 06:25.633
but it was lovely
nonetheless.

06:25.700 --> 06:27.467
Do you want to go in?
I'll bring you in.

06:27.533 --> 06:30.133
- I'll take her in.
- Mia: I'm right behind you.

06:30.200 --> 06:32.600
Save me a seat.

06:32.667 --> 06:34.367
Honey, I know
it's a busy day,

06:34.433 --> 06:36.333
but if things settle down
a bit later,

06:36.400 --> 06:38.333
could you maybe
run me out to a shop

06:38.400 --> 06:42.533
to get a couple of those
nice Irish wool sweaters
they have here?

06:42.600 --> 06:45.033
You know, the big,
thick fisherman ones.

06:45.100 --> 06:46.500
You know
the ones I mean?

06:46.567 --> 06:47.533
My dad's dead.

06:49.267 --> 06:52.367
**

06:55.167 --> 06:57.633
Why am I not more upset?

06:57.700 --> 06:58.667
You are upset.

06:58.733 --> 07:00.300
Not enough.

07:00.367 --> 07:02.800
When you found out that kid
you went to summer camp
with died,

07:02.867 --> 07:04.233
you barely got out of bed.

07:04.300 --> 07:06.433
I had to slap you around.

07:06.500 --> 07:08.267
This is my dad.

07:08.333 --> 07:11.267
This isn't some kid
you showed your dick to once.

07:11.333 --> 07:14.100
- I spent my summers with him.
- Yeah, two summers.

07:14.167 --> 07:15.967
You cried
until you threw up.

07:16.033 --> 07:18.200
Is that what you're
supposed to do?

07:18.267 --> 07:20.133
What's wrong with me?

07:20.200 --> 07:22.033
I know I can cry.

07:22.100 --> 07:23.233
I cried last week
in the bank

07:23.300 --> 07:25.000
when that woman told me
my bag was messy.

07:25.067 --> 07:28.067
[chuckles]
Look, our emotions
are weird, okay?

07:28.133 --> 07:29.733
That's why
they're emotions.

07:29.800 --> 07:33.233
You know,
there's no playbook
on how to grieve.

07:33.300 --> 07:34.500
I want to be sadder.

07:34.567 --> 07:37.633
He fuckin' died
20 minutes ago.

07:37.700 --> 07:39.933
Don't be sad that
you're not sad now.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.500
You're gonna unfold.

07:41.567 --> 07:43.533
You're gonna spend time
on the floor.

07:43.600 --> 07:46.033
- Do you promise?
- I promise.

07:49.633 --> 07:52.500
Last thought I had about him
was that he was a bad dad.

07:54.533 --> 07:56.267
And he wasn't.

07:56.333 --> 08:00.633
He was a great,
complicated, grumpy,

08:00.700 --> 08:02.400
pain in the hole
great dad,

08:02.467 --> 08:04.467
and-- [sighs]

08:04.533 --> 08:06.533
If I could have just had
one weekend with him.

08:06.600 --> 08:09.233
You know,
I think we could have sorted
a lot of our shit out.

08:09.300 --> 08:10.500
Fuck it,
not even a weekend.

08:10.567 --> 08:14.300
An afternoon or a lunch
with no kids around.

08:14.367 --> 08:16.000
I wasn't done with him.

08:23.833 --> 08:24.800
[sighs]

08:28.433 --> 08:30.900
That's not a boner,
is it?

08:30.967 --> 08:33.333
I'm so sorry.

08:33.400 --> 08:34.967
Fuck's sake.

08:35.033 --> 08:37.633
Bye-bye, Mallandra.
Bye, girls.

08:37.700 --> 08:38.967
Bye-bye, sweetheart.

08:39.033 --> 08:40.600
- Take care of yourself.
- You, too.

08:45.333 --> 08:47.500
I'm gonna take
the fastest pee
in the world,

08:47.567 --> 08:49.133
- and I'll be right back.
- Okay.

08:50.667 --> 08:52.800
Shall we tell her to go?
I'll just tell her to go.

08:52.867 --> 08:54.967
- What do you mean?
- Well, if you don't
want her here,

08:55.033 --> 08:56.100
we just have to
tell her to go.

08:56.167 --> 08:58.667
Why? She makes me laugh.

08:58.733 --> 09:00.433
And she does the dishes
after every meal.

09:00.500 --> 09:02.333
If she wants to be here,
then I want her here.

09:02.400 --> 09:04.333
Oh. Oh, okay.
I wasn't--

09:04.400 --> 09:06.767
I'm not ready
to be on my own.

09:10.067 --> 09:12.167
- Bye.
- Take care.

09:15.833 --> 09:17.600
Here.

09:17.667 --> 09:18.700
Don't open it now.

09:18.767 --> 09:21.867
Okay. Is it a check
for 8,000 pounds?

09:21.933 --> 09:24.033
- Asshole.
- Prick.

09:27.967 --> 09:29.933
Have fun in España.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.767
[scoffs]

09:31.833 --> 09:33.767
[car engine starts]

09:35.933 --> 09:37.500
Bye.

09:37.567 --> 09:39.167
Bye.

09:39.233 --> 09:42.767
What the fuck
is going on?

09:42.833 --> 09:45.233
It's sweet.

09:45.300 --> 09:47.933
Wait.
What if they fall in love
and get married?

09:48.000 --> 09:50.033
Does that mean we'd be
brother and sister?

09:50.100 --> 09:52.400
- Are you okay with that?
- I suppose.

09:52.467 --> 09:55.133
Don't think I'm
ever gonna have
sex again, anyway.

09:55.200 --> 09:58.067
Seems like a silly thing
to be all-- [grunting]

09:58.133 --> 09:59.367
You know,
after everything.

09:59.433 --> 10:01.333
Well, that's a
pretty big decision.

10:01.400 --> 10:04.800
You might want to
check with your
brother first.

10:04.867 --> 10:07.800

10:18.333 --> 10:19.433
[sighs]

10:23.933 --> 10:26.033
[cell phone rings]

10:32.900 --> 10:34.867
Hey.

10:34.933 --> 10:35.867
You okay?

10:35.933 --> 10:37.300
Yeah, just, um--

10:37.367 --> 10:38.667
Well, are--
are you okay?

10:38.733 --> 10:40.167
Yeah.

10:40.233 --> 10:43.700
I'm just lying in
the back of Melissa's car.

10:43.767 --> 10:45.400
It's a bit smelly.

10:45.467 --> 10:46.967
It's not as smelly
as our car,

10:47.033 --> 10:50.000
but it smells like
lemongrass and burger meat.

10:50.067 --> 10:51.933
It's not a bad smell,
I just--

10:52.000 --> 10:53.300
I just wonder if she
cooks in here or something.

10:53.367 --> 10:55.433
Why are you in
Melissa's car?

10:55.500 --> 10:57.267
Oh, I just can't handle being
around anyone right now.

10:57.333 --> 10:58.500
It's all right.
I had a free period.

10:58.567 --> 11:00.333
I didn't run out of
the classroom screaming.

11:00.400 --> 11:02.833
You okay?
Why'd you call?

11:02.900 --> 11:05.200
I just wanted to say hi.

11:05.267 --> 11:07.067
Do you want to watch some
"Better Call Sauls" tonight,

11:07.133 --> 11:09.967
and I'll brush your hair?

11:10.033 --> 11:12.267
- Sure.
- Okay.

11:12.333 --> 11:15.167
- Bye.
- Bye.

11:15.233 --> 11:18.333
**

11:28.167 --> 11:29.267
All right.
All right!

11:29.333 --> 11:32.667
Just clearing some shit
out of my house.

11:32.733 --> 11:34.000
Have a nice day.

11:36.167 --> 11:37.667
And correct me
if I'm wrong,

11:37.733 --> 11:39.833
you are a
48 year old man.

11:39.900 --> 11:42.533
Well, do you think that
it's adult behavior to, uh--

11:42.600 --> 11:44.900
Maybe I've lost my mind,
but it seemed to me

11:44.967 --> 11:46.800
that we were in
a relationship.

11:46.867 --> 11:48.600
No, you're right about
all those things.

11:48.667 --> 11:52.267
Um, I am 48,
well, I will be for
a few more weeks,

11:52.333 --> 11:55.000
and we were in
a relationship.

11:55.067 --> 11:57.467
So what happened, then?

11:57.533 --> 12:00.133
We had something.

12:00.200 --> 12:04.200
And the sex was--
All of it was--

12:04.267 --> 12:07.900
I have never enjoyed
[whispers] blowjobs

12:07.967 --> 12:09.133
like I did with you.

12:09.200 --> 12:11.800
Before you,
it was always, you know,

12:11.867 --> 12:15.000
just a bit more of
an obligation.

12:15.067 --> 12:17.167
But I loved it with you.

12:17.233 --> 12:21.667
The chemistry of us
was just--

12:22.767 --> 12:25.833
It just felt right.

12:25.900 --> 12:27.333
In my mouth.

12:27.400 --> 12:29.333
Oh, Fran,
I don't know.

12:29.400 --> 12:32.267
Your son doesn't like me,
I'm not mad about him.

12:32.333 --> 12:35.167
- I don't like your husband.
- He's my ex husband.

12:35.233 --> 12:38.000
Are you sure about that?
You don't know about the
little visit he paid me?

12:38.067 --> 12:40.233
Quite the menacing
little twat.

12:40.300 --> 12:42.167
Anyway, it worked.
I'm out.

12:42.233 --> 12:44.300
- He what?
- And if it's
the sex you miss,

12:44.367 --> 12:45.533
go and have sex
with someone else.

12:45.600 --> 12:48.033
I don't have
a black belt in it.

12:48.100 --> 12:50.067
I didn't invent
getting my dick sucked.

12:54.000 --> 12:57.100
**

13:02.333 --> 13:05.300
Oh, I tried to call,
but I dropped my phone
in Carol's sink,

13:05.367 --> 13:08.567
and now all it'll do is
camera and Angry Birds.

13:08.633 --> 13:10.833
Could you take me to
Car Phone Warehouse later?

13:10.900 --> 13:13.467
- Yeah.
- I gotta zip and
use the bathroom.

13:13.533 --> 13:15.000
I thought you were
staying with Carol.

13:15.067 --> 13:17.233
Oh, I had to
get out of there.

13:17.300 --> 13:18.800
It's too cold.

13:18.867 --> 13:21.633
I mean, cut up some peat
and throw it on a fire.

13:21.700 --> 13:24.667
I wouldn't be surprised
if Des froze to death.

13:24.733 --> 13:26.500
I had to wear
three coats.

13:26.567 --> 13:28.533
I looked like
Nanook of the north.

13:28.600 --> 13:32.233
Anyway,
I feel like I gave it
the good old college try.

13:32.300 --> 13:35.000
You know? I set her on
a good path, I think.

13:35.067 --> 13:37.300
Carol is not gonna be
alone for that long.

13:37.367 --> 13:39.333
Have you seen
her ass?

13:39.400 --> 13:41.900
I mean,
for a woman her age.

13:41.967 --> 13:45.000
How did Sharon get
such a bony ass?

13:45.067 --> 13:47.100
[whistling]

13:47.167 --> 13:49.300
[door bell ringing]

13:53.667 --> 13:55.233
Fran.

13:56.033 --> 13:57.800
Oh!

13:57.867 --> 13:59.567
Jesus!

13:59.633 --> 14:01.233
Christ!

14:01.300 --> 14:03.733
Just what the hell
are you doing?

14:03.800 --> 14:04.967
Hey!

14:05.033 --> 14:06.200
[door closes]

14:06.267 --> 14:08.733
Your mother is
a prick tease.

14:08.800 --> 14:09.967
Okay.

14:10.033 --> 14:11.867
She gets my mother
all juiced up for company,

14:11.933 --> 14:13.467
and then she just
up and splits.

14:13.533 --> 14:16.200
Are you sure
your mom's upset?
Did you ask her?

14:16.267 --> 14:18.833
My mom's not gonna tell me
if she's upset. She's a martyr.

14:18.900 --> 14:21.233
If she tells you
she's not upset,
she's definitely upset.

14:21.300 --> 14:23.367
She tells you she's grand,
then you know she's fine.

14:24.767 --> 14:27.200
Do you want me to tell
my mom to go back there?

14:27.267 --> 14:28.567
Well, that would be bizarre.

14:28.633 --> 14:30.300
No, I don't.
I just want you to know

14:30.367 --> 14:32.000
that I don't like
what she did.

14:32.067 --> 14:33.500
Oh. Okay.

14:33.567 --> 14:35.167
And what's with
all the whistling now?

14:35.233 --> 14:36.533
When did she become
a whistler?

14:36.600 --> 14:38.333
Do you want me to tell her
to stop whistling?

14:38.400 --> 14:40.233
I wouldn't even mind
if she was whistling
something decent.

14:40.300 --> 14:41.600
You know?
It's just fuckin'--

14:41.667 --> 14:43.800
[whistling]
I don't want to
hear that shit.

14:43.867 --> 14:46.300
I mean,
practice and then come and
whistle me something decent.

14:46.367 --> 14:48.633
You know? Bring me
the finished product.

14:48.700 --> 14:50.500
You think someone that old
would have a hard time

14:50.567 --> 14:53.333
thinking of new ways
for you to hate them.

14:53.400 --> 14:55.133
[chuckles]

14:55.200 --> 14:57.767
- How long is she staying?
- I don't know.

14:57.833 --> 14:59.033
She was buying stuff
online earlier

14:59.100 --> 15:00.800
to be delivered
to our house.

15:00.867 --> 15:02.467
That doesn't feel like
a short visit.

15:02.533 --> 15:03.900
I wouldn't worry
about that.

15:03.967 --> 15:05.000
If she's
drawing breath,

15:05.067 --> 15:07.067
she's ordering stuff
online.

15:07.133 --> 15:09.000
For her, it's not about
receiving the stuff,

15:09.067 --> 15:11.500
it's just about...

15:11.567 --> 15:14.600
hittin' that order button
and gettin' the buzz.

15:14.667 --> 15:16.967
Like a junkie.

15:17.033 --> 15:18.533
Oh. Thank you.

15:19.667 --> 15:21.233
For what?

15:21.300 --> 15:23.467
Just for lettin' me
lay into your mother.

15:23.533 --> 15:25.033
I like a lot of things
about you,

15:25.100 --> 15:28.333
but that is up there,
like that is near the top.

15:28.400 --> 15:30.467
Hm. Well, I mean,
the things I hate about her

15:30.533 --> 15:31.467
are set in stone.

15:31.533 --> 15:33.700
You know, so what you say
I listen to,

15:33.767 --> 15:36.100
but that's never
gonna be as bad as
what I know about her.

15:36.167 --> 15:38.800
Well,
thank you anyway.

15:43.367 --> 15:45.067
We're okay, aren't we?

15:45.133 --> 15:47.033
Yeah.
What do you mean?

15:47.100 --> 15:48.433
I don't know,
it's just--

15:48.500 --> 15:50.333
It's been
a tough year so far,

15:50.400 --> 15:54.133
and you were so great
about the, you know,

15:54.200 --> 15:56.833
all the shit with
me and that--

15:56.900 --> 15:59.067
- And, you know.
- Yeah.

15:59.133 --> 16:00.500
And you going back
to Braeband.

16:00.567 --> 16:03.400
I know you hate it there
but you're doing it for us.

16:03.467 --> 16:05.967
I just--

16:06.033 --> 16:08.433
I just think you're
a really good person.

16:08.500 --> 16:11.100
- No, I'm not.
- Yeah, you are.

16:11.167 --> 16:13.467
You're a good husband,
and a good dad,

16:13.533 --> 16:17.667
and for a little while,
after you shower,

16:17.733 --> 16:19.567
you even smell good.

16:27.133 --> 16:28.300
Sharon: I love you.

16:35.767 --> 16:37.100
[knocking]

16:37.167 --> 16:38.967
[door opens]

16:39.033 --> 16:42.133
Oh. Did you have
a nightmare?

16:42.200 --> 16:43.333
What's the matter, honey?

16:43.400 --> 16:45.500
Um...

16:45.567 --> 16:49.733
a few months ago,
I started drinking again.

16:49.800 --> 16:52.633
Nothing terrible
has happened,

16:52.700 --> 16:55.300
but I feel like shit.

16:59.500 --> 17:01.133
I need help,

17:01.200 --> 17:04.200
and I wanted to
tell Sharon,

17:04.267 --> 17:06.700
but then Des died,
so I couldn't,

17:06.767 --> 17:08.367
and I know it would be

17:08.433 --> 17:11.467
a really bad thing
to drink right now,

17:11.533 --> 17:13.767
but I want to.

17:13.833 --> 17:14.767
A lot.

17:18.500 --> 17:21.667
Fucking drinking again?
You can't drink.

17:21.733 --> 17:23.400
I know. I--

17:23.467 --> 17:25.600
- Jesus, Mom, can you not--
- No. You don't know.

17:25.667 --> 17:30.233
You never could drink.
Why is it gonna be
any different now?

17:30.300 --> 17:32.100
You're just like
your father.

17:32.167 --> 17:33.233
What the fuck does that
have to do with it?

17:33.300 --> 17:36.933
You know how my jaw
always clicks?

17:37.000 --> 17:38.867
You know,
when I eat steak?

17:38.933 --> 17:40.433
It's 'cause
your father broke it.

17:42.233 --> 17:43.433
That's why I
kicked him out.

17:43.500 --> 17:46.133
Jesus. Mom,
why didn't you tell me?

17:46.200 --> 17:48.500
Why would my little boy
need to know

17:48.567 --> 17:53.467
that his daddy got drunk
and punched his mommy in
the head?

17:53.533 --> 17:56.767
You put a plug
in the jug, mister,

17:56.833 --> 18:01.267
because if you ever
hit Sharon,

18:01.333 --> 18:03.933
I'll fucking kill you.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.467
I'm not gonna hit her.

18:05.533 --> 18:06.733
Oh, please.

18:06.800 --> 18:11.133
Your being drunk and
her being as annoying
as she is,

18:11.200 --> 18:12.333
you're gonna hit her.

18:13.067 --> 18:15.533
[cell phone ringing]

18:20.700 --> 18:22.267
- Hey, what's up?
- Oh, nothin',

18:22.333 --> 18:24.867
just checkin' in,
see how you're coping.

18:24.933 --> 18:26.333
Really?

18:26.400 --> 18:28.100
Well, I'm totally
fuckin' fine.

18:28.167 --> 18:29.767
Turns out losing your dad
isn't hard at all.

18:29.833 --> 18:31.000
Would you like to
talk about it

18:31.067 --> 18:32.733
- over a drink?
- Not really.

18:32.800 --> 18:34.433
I can make it
easy for you.

18:34.500 --> 18:37.433
Meet you at your local?
I'm here now, as it goes.

18:37.500 --> 18:39.000
Well, look,
Rob's out,

18:39.067 --> 18:41.267
and I feel bad
leaving Mia on her own,

18:41.333 --> 18:43.067
so do you want to
do it another time?

18:43.133 --> 18:44.800
- Okay.
- I'll talk to you.

18:44.867 --> 18:46.167
Bye.

18:53.900 --> 18:56.400
Do you have OWN?

18:56.467 --> 18:57.367
What?

18:57.433 --> 18:58.967
The Oprah Winfrey Network?

18:59.033 --> 19:01.867
I don't know, Mia.
There's, like, 700 channels.

19:01.933 --> 19:04.267
It might be in there.
Hunt around.

19:04.333 --> 19:05.933
Oh, wait.
Never mind.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.167
I just found
my favorite show,

19:07.233 --> 19:08.633
"My Children Are
Schizophrenic."

19:08.700 --> 19:10.433
Oh, so great.

19:10.500 --> 19:12.967
Can you imagine
you have the one kid,
it's schizophrenic,

19:13.033 --> 19:14.867
and then you say,
well, let's roll the dice
and have another kid,

19:14.933 --> 19:16.233
like a friend
for that one,

19:16.300 --> 19:18.667
and then that one's
schizophrenic, also.

19:18.733 --> 19:21.700
So they buy the apartment
or the house next door--

19:21.767 --> 19:23.400
- Hey, Fran.
- ...it's not a lot of money

19:23.467 --> 19:24.967
with the disability
and everything.

19:25.033 --> 19:27.200
It is great TV.

[indistinct chatter]

19:35.300 --> 19:37.067
[cell phone buzzing]

19:39.667 --> 19:41.333
Man: Okay,
ladies and gentlemen,

19:41.400 --> 19:43.500
I think it's time that we
get this meeting started.

19:43.567 --> 19:46.633
If you could, uh,
take your seats, please.

19:48.333 --> 19:50.333
Yeah, we'll just hang on
for a few stragglers.

19:51.700 --> 19:53.800
Fran:
Gonna start volunteering
at the local hospital,

19:53.867 --> 19:58.233
get a sensible haircut,
buy a couple of vibrators.

19:58.300 --> 20:00.200
Maybe get one of those ones
with the wee dangle thing

20:00.267 --> 20:01.467
that tickles the--

20:01.533 --> 20:04.567
Amway, that's it now.
I'm out.

20:04.633 --> 20:08.700
I'm 46 next birthday,
so it was gonna happen
sooner or later.

20:08.767 --> 20:10.567
Oh, Christ.

20:10.633 --> 20:13.867
Look,
I'm too tired to be blowin'
smoke up your arsehole,

20:13.933 --> 20:16.700
but that is too young
to be puttin' yourself
out to pasture.

20:16.767 --> 20:19.800
You know?
I've seen you
in yoga pants.

20:19.867 --> 20:21.000
You still have
something to offer.

20:21.067 --> 20:24.833
[sobbing]
I'm just so horny.

20:24.900 --> 20:26.767
I know, honey.

20:26.833 --> 20:30.633
I mean,
the taste of him.

20:30.700 --> 20:32.033
- It's like--
- I've gotta piss.

20:32.100 --> 20:33.233
It's like--

20:38.167 --> 20:41.033
Aye. She's broken.

20:41.100 --> 20:43.033
I don't think she'll ever
get over this one.

20:43.100 --> 20:46.667
No tincture in the land
can save her now.

20:46.733 --> 20:49.200
Upon reflection, though,
if Fran wanted to be with
that cunt,

20:49.267 --> 20:50.500
I should have let her
be with that cunt.

20:50.567 --> 20:52.033
Plus, your nose
is fucked up.

20:52.100 --> 20:53.733
I don't care about my nose,
I care about my son,

20:53.800 --> 20:57.367
and I have vestigial feelings
for the woman I made him with.

20:57.433 --> 20:59.167
You know how
being a dad is.

20:59.233 --> 21:00.433
Something you'll
soon learn.

21:00.500 --> 21:02.267
Yeah. I'm excited.

21:02.333 --> 21:05.900
I've decided I'm gonna hire
a couple of nannies,

21:05.967 --> 21:08.333
and just be more of
a benevolent figure
in the background.

21:08.400 --> 21:09.833
Like a nice guy he knows

21:09.900 --> 21:11.567
but who won't shape
his personality.

21:11.633 --> 21:13.433
I mean, yeah, he'll have
my shitty genes,

21:13.500 --> 21:16.167
but nature, nurture,
I mean, the jury's out.

21:16.233 --> 21:18.467
No, the jury's in.
They both matter.

21:24.100 --> 21:25.200
I'm totally scared.

21:25.267 --> 21:26.833
Well, why shouldn't you
be scared?

21:26.900 --> 21:29.233
Who are you that
you don't need to be scared?

21:29.300 --> 21:31.500
If you're alive,
you should be scared sometimes.

21:31.567 --> 21:33.600
The world's a fuckin'
slaughterhouse. I'm scared.

21:33.667 --> 21:36.300
I'm really glad
I came out with you guys.

21:39.767 --> 21:41.167
Tell you what, though.

21:41.233 --> 21:43.500
You'll feel a love like
you've never felt before.

21:43.567 --> 21:44.833
Even fuck cocaine.

21:44.900 --> 21:46.100
What about heroin?

21:46.167 --> 21:47.867
I don't know,
I've never tried heroin.

21:47.933 --> 21:50.067
You've never
tried heroin?

21:50.133 --> 21:52.167
I'm done feeding.
I'm gonna go to sleep.

21:58.867 --> 21:59.800
Bye.

22:06.833 --> 22:09.000
How have you
never tried heroin?

22:09.067 --> 22:11.433
I thought you were
from Glasgow?

22:21.167 --> 22:22.700
Oh, fuck's sake.

23:02.100 --> 23:04.133
[sniffling]

23:07.833 --> 23:09.767
[sobbing]

23:20.667 --> 23:22.600
[sobbing continues]

23:24.133 --> 23:25.467
[blowing]

23:33.333 --> 23:34.600
It's gonna be all right.

23:34.667 --> 23:36.400
You okay?

23:38.100 --> 23:39.233
I'm grand.

23:44.967 --> 23:47.067
[cell phone ringing]

23:49.800 --> 23:51.633
- Hey.
- Can you--

23:51.700 --> 23:53.067
Can you come and get me?

23:53.133 --> 23:54.633
Can you not get a taxi?

23:54.700 --> 23:56.933
Wh-- Hang on a second,
there's a--

23:57.000 --> 23:58.700
There's a man here
who wants to have
a quick word with you.

23:58.767 --> 24:00.000
Hold on a second.

24:00.067 --> 24:02.200
Uh, sir, your wife
is very drunk,

24:02.267 --> 24:04.333
and we had to remove her
from our establishment,

24:04.400 --> 24:06.700
so now she's on the streets
like rubbish,

24:06.767 --> 24:08.833
so come and
get your rubbish,

24:08.900 --> 24:11.600
and take it home,
and, you know,
make love to it.

24:11.667 --> 24:14.500
Okay. Tell her
I'm on my way.

24:14.567 --> 24:15.933
Okay.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.567
Oh, no, wait.

24:17.633 --> 24:20.067
She-- She looks like she's
headed into Hernando's.

24:22.300 --> 24:24.267
It was brilliant.
I cried a lot,

24:24.333 --> 24:27.633
and then I threw up
on the window, perhaps.

24:27.700 --> 24:28.900
Well, that's great,
honey.

24:28.967 --> 24:30.067
I know.

24:30.133 --> 24:33.500
I cried for, like,
an hour.

24:33.567 --> 24:35.367
I think I was worried
because I--

24:35.433 --> 24:38.433
I've never lost someone
I really loved before.

24:41.633 --> 24:42.733
Don't ever leave me.

24:42.800 --> 24:44.000
I won't.

24:44.067 --> 24:45.567
Because I'm never
gonna leave you.

24:45.633 --> 24:48.267
And it's not even
because I love you,
I just--

24:48.333 --> 24:51.833
I mean, I do, but
there's a working part
missing now.

24:51.900 --> 24:52.900
You took it out.

24:52.967 --> 24:56.900
Or something and--
[sighs]

24:56.967 --> 24:59.867
Now I just don't work
without you.

24:59.933 --> 25:02.333
I'm 100 percent
reliant on you.

25:02.400 --> 25:03.700
Okay?

25:03.767 --> 25:04.933
Is that sexy?

25:05.000 --> 25:07.767
Is that sexy?
I-- I don't know,

25:07.833 --> 25:09.733
but that's how I feel.

25:16.067 --> 25:18.000
Do you want to put
your hand up my skirt?

25:18.067 --> 25:19.333
Sure.

25:21.633 --> 25:24.067
Come on, that's--
Get in there.

25:25.167 --> 25:26.767
[chuckling]

25:30.667 --> 25:33.167
- Listen, I need to--
- Oh, hang on.

25:33.233 --> 25:34.333
'Cause I need pizza.

25:34.400 --> 25:35.933
Well, Jesus,
don't go in there.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.300
Let me make you something
at home.

25:37.367 --> 25:39.200
No, 'cause I want
something disgusting,

25:39.267 --> 25:40.933
you know, with the
little pepperonis

25:41.000 --> 25:43.200
that are all curled up
like oil cups,

25:43.267 --> 25:45.367
and the oil's all,
you know, yellow.

25:45.433 --> 25:47.800
The oil is all yellow.
[laughing]

25:47.867 --> 25:49.133
All right, let--
let me pull over.

25:49.200 --> 25:50.500
No, it's fine.
It's the light.

25:50.567 --> 25:51.667
- [car horns honk]
- For Christ's sake.

25:54.633 --> 25:57.333
Rob: Jesus!
Fuckin' open your eyes.

25:57.400 --> 25:59.000
Oh, my God!

25:59.067 --> 26:01.300
- Open your fuckin' eyes.
- Fuck.

26:02.400 --> 26:04.700
- [horn honks]
- Shut the fuck up!

26:07.433 --> 26:08.733
[sighs]

26:09.567 --> 26:11.333
[horn honking]

26:11.400 --> 26:13.633
Give me
a fuckin' second.

26:15.200 --> 26:16.567
Goddamnit.

26:25.633 --> 26:27.567
[tires screeching]

26:29.800 --> 26:31.500
Oh, my God.

26:31.567 --> 26:32.500
Oh, my God. Rob!

26:34.867 --> 26:36.000
Rob!

26:36.067 --> 26:37.033
Rob!

26:37.100 --> 26:38.233
What happened?

26:38.300 --> 26:41.000
Are you okay?
I'm gonna get help.

26:41.067 --> 26:43.067
- Fuck!
- Are the police coming?

26:43.133 --> 26:45.033
What? I don't--
I don't know.

26:45.100 --> 26:46.433
An am-- I think it's
an ambulance.

26:46.500 --> 26:48.467
They're gonna give me
a breathalyzer.

26:48.533 --> 26:50.633
What? What?

26:50.700 --> 26:52.667
I'm not gonna pass it.

26:52.733 --> 26:54.067
What?

26:54.133 --> 26:57.067
[sobbing]
I'm sorry.

26:57.133 --> 27:00.767
[siren blaring]

27:00.833 --> 27:03.767

27:07.700 --> 27:10.633
