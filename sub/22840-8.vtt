a ghost army.</i>

00:04.801 --> 00:06.025
<i>Get those Tanks blown up.</i>

00:06.118 --> 00:07.636
<i>So they blow up
Tanks.</i>

00:07.713 --> 00:10.204
This glass
hits my teeth too much.

00:10.281 --> 00:13.425
<i>Well, it's time for you 
to go to your internment camp.</i>

00:13.502 --> 00:16.253
<i>This is completely in...
unconstitutional.</i>

00:16.329 --> 00:19.660
Take it from a drunk guy...
this is *** ridiculous.

00:19.777 --> 00:23.034
<i>Because of World War II,
Hitler's nephew was like,</i>

00:23.111 --> 00:24.983
<i>"Yo,
I want to fight for the U.S."</i>

00:25.060 --> 00:26.925
<i>Pow, pow, pow,
pow, pow.</i>

00:27.002 --> 00:28.746

00:44.363 --> 00:46.565
We're gonna have
a dirty gin martini.

00:46.642 --> 00:48.584
- Were you a bartender?
- I was for a little bit.

00:48.661 --> 00:50.450
It's the only job
I've ever been fired from.

00:50.527 --> 00:52.513
Well, that might be
a little too much gin.

00:52.590 --> 00:54.057
This martini glass

00:54.134 --> 00:56.406
is a Cheesecake Factory
martini glass.

00:56.483 --> 00:58.309
Is that where you were
the bartender of...

00:58.386 --> 01:01.967
No, I wasn't. I was a waiter
at The Cheesecake Factory

01:02.044 --> 01:04.278
for two years.

01:04.355 --> 01:05.979
Hello, I'm John Lutz.

01:06.056 --> 01:07.813
Today
we'll be talking

01:07.881 --> 01:09.253
about the history of
The Cheesecake Factory.

01:09.330 --> 01:11.224
No, no, no, no, we got to
talk about the Ghost Army.

01:11.301 --> 01:13.523
- The Ghost Army.
- Sorry, cheesecakes.

01:13.600 --> 01:14.978
Sorry,
Cheesecake Factory.

01:15.055 --> 01:16.731
We'll see you next time.

01:16.808 --> 01:17.833
Cheers.

01:17.910 --> 01:20.494
Hello,
my name is John Lutz,

01:20.571 --> 01:23.008
and today
we will be discussing

01:23.307 --> 01:25.063
the Ghost Army.

01:25.576 --> 01:30.161
<i>In the Autumn of 1943,
it was World War II.</i>

01:30.265 --> 01:31.408
<i>There was a General...</i>

01:31.485 --> 01:33.945
<i>a General by the name
of General Marshall.</i>

01:34.022 --> 01:36.518
<i>And he came up with
this crazy new tactic</i>

01:36.595 --> 01:38.810
<i>to help defeat the Nazis.</i>

01:39.042 --> 01:42.564
General Marshall came
to President Roosevelt.

01:42.641 --> 01:46.861
<i>"Okay, here's the thing...
it is a fake army.</i>

01:46.938 --> 01:51.072
<i>"It's a fake war, and it will distract
the German army,</i>

01:51.149 --> 01:53.747
<i>and then we'll do the
actual battles over here."</i>

01:53.846 --> 01:57.020
<i>Then FDR said, "Whaaaaat?</i>

01:57.112 --> 01:58.555
<i>Already on board."</i>

02:01.731 --> 02:04.192
This glass
hits my teeth too much.

02:05.976 --> 02:07.371
<i>So General Marshall</i>

02:07.448 --> 02:09.452
<i>came to
Lieutenant Colonel Harry Reeder.</i>

02:09.529 --> 02:11.921
<i>He said,
"You will... be in charge</i>

02:11.998 --> 02:14.016
<i>of a ghost army."</i>

02:14.093 --> 02:16.765
<i>Reeder was like,
"That sounds like a good idea,</i>

02:16.842 --> 02:20.637
<i>"but I'm a soldier.
I should be on the front lines</i>

02:20.714 --> 02:22.230
<i>fighting for real."</i>

02:22.307 --> 02:25.236
<i>And then he was like,
 "I know you're a 'soldjler'..."</i>

02:25.313 --> 02:26.864
"And... soldier."

02:29.303 --> 02:30.303
"And...

02:30.910 --> 02:33.340
<i>"You get
to cherry-pick everybody.</i>

02:33.471 --> 02:35.587
<i>If you think they're right
for your team, take 'em."</i>

02:35.664 --> 02:37.519
<i>And so that's what he did.</i>

02:37.596 --> 02:41.355
<i>Harry Reeder brought together
artists, like sound artists,</i>

02:41.432 --> 02:42.829
<i>design artists, actors.</i>

02:42.906 --> 02:44.792
<i>One guy was like,
"This is insane.</i>

02:44.869 --> 02:47.814
<i>"I thought I was gonna be
a soldier, but I'm happy</i>

02:47.891 --> 02:50.883
<i>that I'm not because
I would be dead soon."</i>

02:50.960 --> 02:51.969
So...

02:53.468 --> 02:55.657
this is where
the story gets good.

02:55.734 --> 02:58.400
<i>Once he assembled his team,
they go to Europe,</i>

02:58.477 --> 02:59.758
<i>where the war was.</i>

02:59.835 --> 03:01.843
<i>Harry Reeder's like,
"Here's what you're gonna...</i>

03:01.920 --> 03:03.088
<i>"here's what you're gonna do.</i>

03:03.165 --> 03:05.587
<i>"Let's get inflatable Tanks.</i>

03:05.664 --> 03:08.815
<i>You, get those Tanks
blown up, asap."</i>

03:09.016 --> 03:10.635
<i>So he blew up Tanks.</i>

03:10.797 --> 03:13.234
<i>"Here's the other thing...
you're gonna use fake guns,</i>

03:13.311 --> 03:14.951
<i>but we're gonna use fireworks."</i>

03:15.028 --> 03:17.570
<i>They're like, "I love fireworks."</i>

03:17.647 --> 03:21.575
<i>And then he's like,
"You, make this a headquarters.</i>

03:21.652 --> 03:24.573
<i>Build it up, build it up.
Get those signs going."</i>

03:25.274 --> 03:29.759
And, if you will,
imagine a montage.

03:29.845 --> 03:31.643
<i>I will.
They blow up Tanks.</i>

03:31.711 --> 03:34.137
<i>You move them easily...
two people, three people</i>

03:34.214 --> 03:39.143
<i>can move them, and they make
fake guns, fake planes...</i>

03:39.227 --> 03:41.207
- Mm.
- And then they blast out

03:41.284 --> 03:44.479
these radio transmissions
that sound like Tanks.

03:47.555 --> 03:49.248
<i>And then they create fireworks</i>

03:49.325 --> 03:50.546
<i>that look like explosions</i>

03:50.623 --> 03:52.455
<i>- and shooting guns.
- It's *** brilliant.</i>

03:52.532 --> 03:53.987
<i>It's really smart.</i>

03:54.313 --> 03:56.278
It's near the end of the war,
by the by,

03:56.355 --> 04:00.408
and it is very a significant
victory they need.

04:00.594 --> 04:03.276
<i>Eisenhower orders up Operation Plunder.</i>

04:03.353 --> 04:05.776
<i>Eisenhower came to
Lieutenant Colonel Merrick Truly,</i>

04:05.871 --> 04:07.310
<i>who was a member of the Ghost Army,</i>

04:07.387 --> 04:09.718
<i>and he said,
"Our division is gonna cross here</i>

04:09.795 --> 04:11.058
<i>"at the Rhine River.</i>

04:11.135 --> 04:15.806
<i>"Your Ghost Army is gonna
be 10 miles south, okay?</i>

04:15.883 --> 04:19.949
<i>"The big thing is you have to make sure
 that the German army</i>

04:20.026 --> 04:22.255
<i>thinks it's 30,000 people."</i>

04:22.332 --> 04:27.554
<i>And Truly said,
"Aye, aye. We'll do it."</i>

04:27.677 --> 04:29.429
<i>So the Ghost Army soldiers</i>

04:29.506 --> 04:31.131
<i>go 10 miles down.</i>

04:31.208 --> 04:34.554
<i>Truly gets everybody together
and says, "You, you, you...</i>

04:34.631 --> 04:35.724
<i>what do you got?"</i>

04:35.801 --> 04:37.039
<i>He says,
"We're gonna be the only ones</i>

04:37.116 --> 04:38.868
<i>broadcasting radio-ly."</i>

04:38.945 --> 04:40.104
<i>"Um..."</i>

04:40.181 --> 04:41.249
Sorry.

04:41.334 --> 04:45.199
"Um,
can all the Allied forces

04:45.276 --> 04:47.273
<i>"please meet at this
latitude and longitude</i>

04:47.350 --> 04:49.515
"at the location of
where we're going to cross

04:49.592 --> 04:51.962
<i>the Rhine River
and defeat the Germans?"</i>

04:52.039 --> 04:57.595
<i>What else?
Overly sized pants.</i>

04:57.672 --> 04:59.083
That's just a Lutz idea.

04:59.160 --> 05:02.151
<i>Lutz, Lutz, Lutz. Actors,
what are you gonna do?</i>

05:02.228 --> 05:04.452
<i>Well, we're gonna walk around
and look like real troops.</i>

05:04.529 --> 05:06.009
<i>Real people.</i>

05:06.086 --> 05:07.523
<i>Art design, go.</i>

05:07.600 --> 05:09.837
<i>Art design said,
"200 inflatable Tanks...</i>

05:09.914 --> 05:12.695
<i>we'll throw in two real Tanks
just to make it look good."</i>

05:12.772 --> 05:15.492
<i>And then there's one guy who's
like, "If anybody comes by,</i>

05:15.569 --> 05:18.640
<i>"I'm gonna create
a dump that looks like</i>

05:18.717 --> 05:23.065
<i>30,000 soldiers worth of trash."</i>

05:23.249 --> 05:25.366
<i>Audio department, go.</i>

05:25.443 --> 05:27.546
<i>We'll have these speakers
blaring out sounds</i>

05:27.623 --> 05:30.252
that are like 'tr-tranks.'

05:30.369 --> 05:31.811
"Tranks"?

05:32.358 --> 05:33.914
- Tanks.
- Oh, like Tanks.

05:33.991 --> 05:35.417
Like Tanks.

05:35.494 --> 05:39.093
<i>Then the night of the
actual crossing happens.</i>

05:39.170 --> 05:41.424
<i>The Ghost Army gets in position,</i>

05:41.571 --> 05:44.518
<i>Ten miles up, Churchill
actually shows up</i>

05:44.606 --> 05:47.663
<i>and is with Eisenhower
to see this battle,</i>

05:47.740 --> 05:51.108
<i>and Churchill's like,
"hey, I hope this idea works</i>

05:51.185 --> 05:53.031
<i>that you had
that we're crossing here."</i>

05:53.108 --> 05:55.171
<i>And Eisenhower's like,
"Trust me... we have</i>

05:55.248 --> 05:59.166
<i>our Ghost Army ten miles down
the road... or River Rhine.</i>

06:00.625 --> 06:01.969
<i>Sorry.</i>

06:02.046 --> 06:03.986
Ghost Army!

06:05.187 --> 06:08.077
10 miles from here,
and that's where

06:08.154 --> 06:11.392
<i>all the Germans are.
Can you believe it?</i>

06:12.101 --> 06:13.364
<i>It's almost like they put on</i>

06:13.441 --> 06:15.324
<i>a show, and the Germans fell for it.</i>

06:15.401 --> 06:17.069
<i>The German army was
sitting there,</i>

06:17.146 --> 06:18.767
<i>and they were like...</i>

06:18.844 --> 06:22.306
<i>"We are ready
for them to cross the Rhine!"</i>

06:22.708 --> 06:26.654
<i>Eisenhower says, "Now, look."
And Eisenhower puts up these</i>

06:26.731 --> 06:28.983
<i>binoculars to Churchill's
eyes, and he looks out,</i>

06:29.060 --> 06:31.712
<i>and he's like, "Holy moly."</i>

06:32.125 --> 06:36.205
<i>"There's no Germans
who are attacking us."</i>

06:37.828 --> 06:40.336
I'm making him like a penguin

06:40.413 --> 06:43.697
for some reason.
It's just...

06:44.336 --> 06:48.061
<i>Operation Plunder was one of
the final nails in the coffin,</i>

06:48.138 --> 06:50.626
<i>in Hitler's horrible regime.</i>

06:50.703 --> 06:54.501
<i>This ragtag group of
artists saved the world</i>

06:54.610 --> 06:58.056
<i>all through nonviolent means.</i>

07:00.613 --> 07:02.962
Cheers, Lutz, so good.

07:04.370 --> 07:05.814
Good night.

07:10.526 --> 07:12.256
Did you ever think
about joining the Army?

07:12.333 --> 07:14.835
- I did.
- What made you say,

07:14.912 --> 07:16.569
- "No, no, no"?
- My mom said, "No."

07:16.646 --> 07:18.310
And I was like, "Okay."

07:18.396 --> 07:19.711
That's how strong I am.

07:19.788 --> 07:21.432
If my mom says "no,
" I say "no."

07:21.509 --> 07:24.118
- Did you do anything like that?
- Mm-mm.

07:24.451 --> 07:26.471
- You can drink.
- I can.

07:26.548 --> 07:28.820
I can drink. Tell some stories.

07:28.934 --> 07:30.867
That's our,
that's our contribution.

07:30.944 --> 07:32.403
Yeah.
You're welcome, America.

07:32.471 --> 07:33.512
There we go.

07:33.580 --> 07:35.625
- Cheers to you.
- There you go, cheers.

07:35.736 --> 07:41.216
Hello, my name is Randall Park,
and you are about to hear

07:41.293 --> 07:45.829
a story about Frank Emi. Uh... yeah.

07:47.838 --> 07:50.697
<i>So Frank Emi was born
in Los Angeles,</i>

07:50.774 --> 07:54.184
<i>and he worked for his
parents' produce market.</i>

07:54.261 --> 07:59.319
<i>And when Frank became of
age, the parents were like,</i>

07:59.396 --> 08:01.786
<i>"Okay, it's time for you to
take over this fruit market."</i>

08:01.863 --> 08:05.637
<i>And Frank was like, "Sweet,
because I got plans.</i>

08:05.714 --> 08:07.918
<i>I'm gonna live the American Dream."</i>

08:07.995 --> 08:12.348
Then on December 7, 1941,
Frank Emi was listening

08:12.425 --> 08:14.649
<i>to the radio, and he
hears...</i>

08:15.398 --> 08:18.125
<i>"Hey, everybody,
this is the radio,</i>

08:18.435 --> 08:20.400
<i>"and I have news for you.</i>

08:20.477 --> 08:25.273
<i>"It's breaking news...
the Japs have bombed Pearl Harbor.</i>

08:25.542 --> 08:27.237
"Don't be offended
this is what... how...

08:27.314 --> 08:29.042
"this is how what we
call them right now.

08:29.119 --> 08:31.505
<i>"We call them 'Japs.' It's all good.</i>

08:31.582 --> 08:34.738
<i>And they just bombed Pearl Harbor."</i>

08:38.938 --> 08:43.725
So... so he was like,
"Oh, shit. This is crazy,

08:43.846 --> 08:47.341
<i>"but probably won't affect
me. I'm an American citizen,</i>

08:47.418 --> 08:49.585
<i>"and I've been here all my life.</i>

08:49.672 --> 08:50.696
<i>It'll be fine."</i>

08:50.773 --> 08:53.442
<i>And then a couple months
later from the bombing</i>

08:53.519 --> 08:56.741
<i>of Pearl Harbor,
Franklin Delano Roosevelt</i>

08:56.818 --> 09:01.956
<i>basically said, "The
Japanese are officially</i>

09:02.109 --> 09:06.019
<i>"a national threat to
the national security.</i>

09:06.096 --> 09:09.559
<i>And, yes, I used 'national'
twice in the same sentence..."</i>

09:10.500 --> 09:11.618
Excuse me.

09:11.750 --> 09:16.449
<i>"Therefore, we must put them...
round them up and put them</i>

09:16.526 --> 09:20.606
<i>in internment camps because
they're too dangerous."</i>

09:20.683 --> 09:25.250
And then... and then,
uh... and then... um...

09:25.335 --> 09:27.522
Sorry. I lost my train of thought.

09:27.888 --> 09:29.613
I was onto something.

09:29.690 --> 09:32.007
Oh, man, I'm, like, gone.

09:33.474 --> 09:37.238
So, like, basically Frank
was like, "Is this for real?

09:37.306 --> 09:38.993
<i>This is mind-blowing."</i>

09:39.061 --> 09:40.149
<i>And the next thing you know,</i>

09:40.217 --> 09:41.835
<i>it's, like, a knock at the door.</i>

09:42.501 --> 09:46.245
<i>"It's the... it's the
United States of America."</i>

09:46.415 --> 09:49.090
<i>"Uh, yeah, what do you want?"</i>

09:49.167 --> 09:51.592
<i>"Well, it's time for
you to go to your...</i>

09:51.669 --> 09:53.171
<i>to your internment camp."</i>

09:53.248 --> 09:55.358
They were a bunch of Jeff Foxworthys?

09:55.435 --> 09:58.098
Yeah, yeah, and they were
like, "You know you're

09:58.175 --> 10:01.768
<i>"a redneck if you're walking
people into trains to get</i>

10:01.845 --> 10:06.135
<i>sent off into internment camps
and you don't give a."</i>

10:09.546 --> 10:12.765
And then they got rounded
up into these trains,

10:12.842 --> 10:15.199
<i>and they head off to
Wyoming, and then they get to</i>

10:15.276 --> 10:18.400
<i>this internment camp
called Heart Mountain.</i>

10:18.539 --> 10:20.624
<i>What a name, right,
for an internment camp.</i>

10:20.701 --> 10:22.005
<i>How much heart was there?</i>

10:22.082 --> 10:24.628
- No heart, no heart, no love.
- Just a mountain.

10:24.705 --> 10:26.202
Just a mountain.
They should've just

10:26.279 --> 10:27.768
called it Mountain.

10:28.140 --> 10:31.918
<i>So here's this Japanese
phrase, "Shikata ga nai."</i>

10:31.995 --> 10:34.037
It basically means "It can't be helped."

10:34.114 --> 10:35.788
<i>- Shikata...
- Ga nai.</i>

10:35.865 --> 10:37.480
<i>- Ga nai.</i>
- <i>Ga nai,</i> yeah.

10:37.557 --> 10:40.518
<i>- Shikata ga nai.</i>
- Yeah, that was right.

10:40.641 --> 10:43.960
So Frank is like, "No, this
is... we got to do something

10:44.037 --> 10:45.900
<i>"about this.
We're Americans.</i>

10:46.002 --> 10:49.002
<i>This is completely in...
unconstitutional."</i>

10:49.085 --> 10:51.718
<i>And that's when a soldier
comes up to him and is like,</i>

10:51.795 --> 10:53.643
<i>"Fill out this loyalty oath."</i>

10:53.720 --> 10:56.502
<i>And on it, it has a
bunch of just questions.</i>

10:56.697 --> 11:00.420
"Do you like
hamburgers?"

11:00.497 --> 11:02.827
- Do you like hamburgers?
- Dumb questions, right?

11:02.904 --> 11:05.674
Well, do... I know, I'm asking
you, do you like hamburgers?

11:05.948 --> 11:07.054
Are you questioning

11:07.131 --> 11:08.366
- my loyalty right now?
- No, I'm just asking

11:08.443 --> 11:09.979
if you like hamburgers.

11:10.227 --> 11:11.580
- Cheeseburgers.
- Of course.

11:11.657 --> 11:13.266
- Yes, okay.
- You're *** a asshole

11:13.343 --> 11:15.757
- if you want a hamburger.
- Yes, if you had the choice.

11:15.834 --> 11:17.125
- Yeah.
- Right.

11:17.202 --> 11:20.147
<i>And then he comes to this
question "Are you loyal</i>

11:20.224 --> 11:21.564
<i>to the United States?"</i>

11:21.641 --> 11:23.522
<i>And he's like,
"Whoa, wait a minute.</i>

11:23.599 --> 11:28.165
<i>"You just, like, stripped us
of our rights and privileges</i>

11:28.242 --> 11:30.374
<i>"as citizens of this...
of the United States,</i>

11:30.451 --> 11:32.893
<i>and now you're asking
us if we're loyal?"</i>

11:32.970 --> 11:35.075
So Frank stood up,
and he's like,

11:35.152 --> 11:37.420
<i>"Under the present circumstances,</i>

11:37.571 --> 11:41.397
<i>I cannot and will not
answer these questions."</i>

11:41.578 --> 11:44.268
- That's so cool.
- Boss move.

11:44.508 --> 11:48.286
<i>So he starts posting flyers
all around the camps.</i>

11:48.363 --> 11:52.400
<i>"Hey, everybody, like,
don't check these boxes.</i>

11:52.477 --> 11:56.250
<i>Come with me and
defy this order."</i>

11:56.419 --> 11:59.846
<i>And as he was hammering
this thing on a post,</i>

11:59.923 --> 12:02.382
<i>this dude comes up to him
and is like, "Hey, man,</i>

12:02.459 --> 12:04.451
<i>I'm coming with you."
Frank Emi was like,</i>

12:04.528 --> 12:05.941
<i>"What's your name?" He was like,</i>

12:06.018 --> 12:07.320
<i>"I'm Frank Inouye."</i>

12:07.397 --> 12:08.896
<i>and they were like,
"Oh, shit, Frank.</i>

12:08.973 --> 12:10.397
"We're both... that's kind of cool.

12:10.474 --> 12:11.824
<i>But this sucks."</i>

12:11.901 --> 12:16.408
<i>So why don't we meet and figure
out what to do about this?</i>

12:16.706 --> 12:19.683
<i>And then the government was
like, "We need more troops.</i>

12:19.760 --> 12:22.592
<i>We're gonna start drafting
Japanese Americans</i>

12:22.669 --> 12:23.874
<i>to fight in the war.</i>

12:23.951 --> 12:27.173
Take it from a drunk guy on,
you know, on a comedy show

12:27.250 --> 12:30.743
on Comedy Central,
this is *** ridiculous.

12:30.820 --> 12:33.035
<i>So at that point,
Frank Emi was like,</i>

12:33.112 --> 12:34.714
<i>"Oh, hell no. No, no."</i>

12:34.791 --> 12:39.048
This is when The Heart Mountain
Fair Play Committee was born.

12:39.125 --> 12:42.693
<i>And their mantra was
"No shikata ga nai."</i>

12:42.770 --> 12:45.425
<i>And they would say this.
No shikata ga nai.</i>

12:45.502 --> 12:49.013
No <i>shikata ga nai.</i>
No <i>shikata ga nai.</i>

12:49.090 --> 12:50.764
<i>No</i> shikata ga nai.

12:50.841 --> 12:53.339
They were now
this unified group that...

12:53.416 --> 12:57.576
and their main tactic
was to resist the draft.

12:57.653 --> 13:00.122
<i>During these mandatory
recruitment sessions,</i>

13:00.199 --> 13:03.537
<i>the first thing they'd do is
send this pre-draft physical...</i>

13:03.614 --> 13:04.717
<i>don't even touch it.</i>

13:04.794 --> 13:06.335
<i>- Just return it empty.
- Yeah.</i>

13:06.412 --> 13:09.236
<i>And then they, well,
they won't be able to do anything.</i>

13:09.313 --> 13:12.504
<i>And then these U.S. Marshals
with guns, and they're like,</i>

13:12.581 --> 13:16.147
<i>"You guys are under
arrest. Come with me."</i>

13:16.224 --> 13:18.297
<i>So they came.</i>

13:18.458 --> 13:20.328
- "Comed"?
- They "comed" to the court.

13:20.405 --> 13:21.605
They "comed" to the court.

13:21.682 --> 13:23.597
<i>They were 63 of them
in this trial,</i>

13:23.674 --> 13:25.504
<i>and at this point,
these guys were, like,</i>

13:25.581 --> 13:27.271
masters of the Constitution.

13:27.348 --> 13:29.374
<i>So they were like,
"We're gonna be okay."</i>

13:29.451 --> 13:30.714
<i>And then this judge comes up.</i>

13:30.791 --> 13:34.458
<i>The first thing he refers to
them as is "You Jap boys."</i>

13:34.535 --> 13:37.594
<i>Then they all realize,
like, "We're done."</i>

13:37.754 --> 13:40.824
<i>And they ended up going to prison.</i>

13:40.901 --> 13:44.582
<i>So when all was said and done,
almost 500 men throughout</i>

13:44.659 --> 13:49.381
<i>all the internment camps
resisted the draft in some way.</i>

13:49.504 --> 13:53.347
<i>So eventually the war, like, ends.</i>

13:53.434 --> 13:56.270
<i>So Frank Emi ended up
spending 18 months</i>

13:56.347 --> 13:59.084
<i>of his four-year sentence in prison,</i>

13:59.250 --> 14:02.732
<i>and then in 1947, President Truman</i>

14:02.809 --> 14:06.167
<i>officially apologized
to Frank Emi.</i>

14:06.244 --> 14:08.399
<i>Sorry we kind of screwed up.</i>

14:08.476 --> 14:12.011
<i>And he basically said,
"Thank you."</i>

14:12.663 --> 14:14.722
<i>- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Let's help each other.</i>

14:14.799 --> 14:16.533
<i>We're all the same.</i>

14:16.610 --> 14:17.573
Come.

14:18.407 --> 14:21.004
- I mean, not...
- We come the same color.

14:21.081 --> 14:22.709
<i>Let's come together.</i>

14:23.701 --> 14:25.148
I came twice.

14:30.074 --> 14:32.374
Okay, so, yeah, so, cheers to...

14:32.474 --> 14:33.946
You know what?
It's okay if you don't like

14:34.023 --> 14:35.660
- everyone you're related to.
- Yeah.

14:35.737 --> 14:37.545
I don't like
some of my family.

14:37.711 --> 14:38.984
Do you like everybody
in your family?

14:39.061 --> 14:40.445
- Mm-mm.
- So cheers to that.

14:40.522 --> 14:42.454
- Cheers to...
- You can pick your friends.

14:42.531 --> 14:44.465
But you can't pick your family.

14:44.563 --> 14:46.018
Mm.

14:47.554 --> 14:49.264
Hello, my name is...

14:49.542 --> 14:52.751
Hello, my name is Lyric Lewis,
and tonight we're gonna

14:52.828 --> 14:58.616
talk about Willy Hitler,
the nephew of Adolf Hitler.

14:58.831 --> 14:59.965
Hmm.

15:01.110 --> 15:03.315
Oh, excuse me.

15:04.419 --> 15:06.668
<i>So our story begins
in Liverpool, England.</i>

15:06.745 --> 15:08.856
<i>William Hitler is living
his young life,</i>

15:08.933 --> 15:11.117
<i>and in 1930,
his father was like,</i>

15:11.194 --> 15:14.022
<i>"Yo,
come and meet your uncle."</i>

15:14.947 --> 15:17.858
<i>So they go to
the chancellery in Berlin,</i>

15:18.609 --> 15:20.878
<i>and Willy is like,
"What, what, what?</i>

15:20.955 --> 15:23.388
<i>This is my uncle?"
His uncle is the head</i>

15:23.465 --> 15:25.464
<i>of the Nazi party,
which, side note,</i>

15:25.541 --> 15:27.613
this is before World War II.

15:27.690 --> 15:30.436
<i>Hitler was like, "Yo, let's
take a picture together,</i>

15:30.513 --> 15:32.405
<i>then I'm gonna autograph it."</i>

15:32.802 --> 15:35.257
<i>So they took a picture,
and he had a big position,</i>

15:35.334 --> 15:37.001
<i>and he looked up to him,
and he was just like,</i>

15:37.078 --> 15:39.300
<i>"Wow, my uncle's dope as ***."</i>

15:39.377 --> 15:40.976
<i>And Willy's like, "You know what?</i>

15:41.053 --> 15:45.388
<i>I want a high-ranking position
in my uncle's socialist party."</i>

15:45.465 --> 15:46.877
And so he moves to Germany.

15:46.954 --> 15:49.388
<i>It's very romantic in Germany
and actually a good time.</i>

15:49.465 --> 15:51.424
<i>Everybody was German,
eating schnitzel.</i>

15:51.501 --> 15:53.564
<i>Willy was like,
"Hey, everybody,</i>

15:53.641 --> 15:57.303
<i>"my name is Willy Hitler,
Adolf Hitler's my uncle.</i>

15:57.415 --> 15:59.561
<i>He's gonna hook me up."</i>

16:00.241 --> 16:02.194
<i>So he bust in the chancellery,</i>

16:02.271 --> 16:04.737
he burst in,
and his secretary's like,

16:04.814 --> 16:08.071
<i>"Oh,
pump all of your brakes.</i>

16:08.148 --> 16:11.186
<i>You know Hitler
don't *** with you like that."</i>

16:11.670 --> 16:15.967
<i>So he waits.
He doesn't wait a day,</i>

16:16.169 --> 16:18.893
not a week, he doesn't
even wait three weeks.

16:18.970 --> 16:21.201
<i>He waits two mother*** months.</i>

16:21.323 --> 16:23.704
<i>So Willy Hitler was
like "I'm mat."</i>

16:23.781 --> 16:26.016
<i>Mat,
what does that word mean?</i>

16:26.208 --> 16:28.131
<i>Mat means, like, you're not even,</i>

16:28.208 --> 16:29.573
you're not mad.

16:29.650 --> 16:31.709
You're not M-A-D. When you're "mat,"

16:31.786 --> 16:34.654
<i>you're beyond the point of mad,
and you're like mad</i>

16:34.731 --> 16:36.626
<i>and insulted.
You're disrespected.</i>

16:36.703 --> 16:38.452
<i>Got ya.</i>

16:40.070 --> 16:42.624
<i>But anyways,
he goes into his office.</i>

16:42.794 --> 16:44.925
Hitler was just looking
at his goddamn maps.

16:45.002 --> 16:46.450
Hitler was like, "Mm, mm,

16:46.527 --> 16:48.297
<i>my maps of everywhere
I want to go."</i>

16:48.374 --> 16:53.653
And Adolf Hitler in his hand
has a horsing whipping whip.

16:53.730 --> 16:55.552
<i>He's doing it at his toes.</i>

16:57.738 --> 17:01.682
<i>Adolf was like,
"I'm so sorry that you have to work</i>

17:01.759 --> 17:03.716
<i>for your goddamn money."</i>

17:04.829 --> 17:08.943
<i>"I didn't get this chancellor
job for the family, so, no."</i>

17:11.536 --> 17:13.599
<i>So Willy left that meeting,
and Willy was like,</i>

17:13.676 --> 17:15.178
<i>"Hell to the no."</i>

17:15.255 --> 17:16.551
<i>Willy was pissed.</i>

17:16.628 --> 17:18.513
<i>Milly was piss...</i>

17:18.590 --> 17:20.704
Mat, then pissed.

17:20.781 --> 17:23.701
And he decided that he wanted
to do something about it,

17:23.778 --> 17:26.501
so
Buckle your seat belt.

17:27.786 --> 17:30.227
But, no, really,
buckle your seat belt.

17:33.982 --> 17:36.885
- We're doing tequila.
- We're doing te-quill-as.

17:40.444 --> 17:42.352
Mm-hmm.

17:43.002 --> 17:48.989
Anyways, so William goes
to the United States in 1939

17:49.066 --> 17:51.193
<i>and decided to do,
like, a lecture tour.</i>

17:51.270 --> 17:53.135
<i>And he spilled all the beans.</i>

17:53.231 --> 17:55.109
<i>He's saying, like,
"Yo, my uncle's, like,</i>

17:55.186 --> 17:56.739
<i>super racist."
He's saying, "My uncles want</i>

17:56.816 --> 17:59.234
<i>"to invade your countries
and take over</i>

17:59.311 --> 18:01.625
<i>and do horrible things
when he invades."</i>

18:01.702 --> 18:04.922
<i>But people were like,
"Yeah, well, okay,</i>

18:05.015 --> 18:09.023
<i>okay, we'll believe it
when we see it, Willy."</i>

18:09.738 --> 18:12.488
<i>And then
because of World War II,</i>

18:12.565 --> 18:15.118
<i>he was like, "Yo, I want
to fight for the U.S."</i>

18:15.195 --> 18:18.741
<i>So he goes to meet with
Franklin Delano Roosevelt.</i>

18:18.818 --> 18:20.616
<i>And he was very impassioned.</i>

18:20.693 --> 18:23.750
<i>And he was like, "I know
that I'm, like, one person,"</i>

18:23.907 --> 18:26.941
<i>but he was like, "I can fight
for the greater cause of many."</i>

18:27.018 --> 18:29.782
<i>And he's like, "I know I'm,
like, one little baby Hitler,</i>

18:29.859 --> 18:32.466
<i>"like, I'm, like, technically
a Hitler," but he's like,</i>

18:32.543 --> 18:34.646
<i>"I don't *** with
the Hitlers like that."</i>

18:34.723 --> 18:37.599
<i>And FDR was like,
right, if he says he don't ♪♪♪</i>

18:37.676 --> 18:40.019
<i>"with Hitler,
like, we can't chastise</i>

18:40.096 --> 18:41.578
<i>the man for his name."</i>

18:41.725 --> 18:44.363
<i>And so Willy, he gets
accepted to the Navy, and then</i>

18:44.440 --> 18:45.915
<i>he goes into basic training.</i>

18:45.992 --> 18:48.093
<i>He...
he trains night and day.</i>

18:48.170 --> 18:50.372
<i>By day,
he's running through tires,</i>

18:50.449 --> 18:53.262
<i>climbing over ropes,
underneath mud,</i>

18:53.369 --> 18:56.034
<i>and he's like
"Yeah, I can't wait *** to see</i>

18:56.111 --> 18:58.976
<i>my uncle's face and then
shoot his mustache off."</i>

19:00.127 --> 19:01.949
He said... hold up.

19:02.026 --> 19:04.000
Excuse me,
he did not burp.

19:06.561 --> 19:07.856
Ooh, it's wavy.

19:07.933 --> 19:10.255
<i>So Willy's on the ship.
They're at war.</i>

19:10.332 --> 19:11.924
<i>Big explosions all around.</i>

19:12.001 --> 19:13.067
<i>He's a paramedic.</i>

19:13.144 --> 19:14.956
<i>He's throwing aspirin
in people's mouth.</i>

19:15.033 --> 19:16.174
<i>They're catching it.</i>

19:16.251 --> 19:19.357
<i>Holding their wounds,
giving them little shots.</i>

19:19.434 --> 19:21.145
<i>So he's in the Navy for three years.</i>

19:21.222 --> 19:22.667
<i>So, all of a sudden,
people are shooting.</i>

19:22.744 --> 19:24.364
<i>It's like...
purrah tha ttha</i>

19:24.441 --> 19:27.627
And then he... wait... and then...

19:27.704 --> 19:29.964
<i>Now, all of a sudden,
there's a big explosion,</i>

19:30.041 --> 19:32.057
<i>and he's hit
with a piece of shrapnel.</i>

19:32.134 --> 19:34.836
<i>He was like,
"I'm out of the Navy."</i>

19:35.020 --> 19:37.159
<i>So Hitler...</i>

19:37.236 --> 19:40.335
- Baby Hitler, he...
- Baby Hitler?

19:40.412 --> 19:41.850
Now we're going "baby"?

19:41.927 --> 19:43.117
Okay, so moving on.

19:43.194 --> 19:48.500
So
They honorably discharged him,

19:48.584 --> 19:50.807
<i>and America was like,
"You know what?</i>

<i>"You're not just a baby Hitler.
You a G.</i>

19:53.770 --> 19:55.575
<i>You like an OG,"
and they were like,</i>

19:55.652 --> 19:57.266
<i>"We're gonna give you
a Purple Heart</i>

19:57.350 --> 19:58.979

19:59.056 --> 20:01.666
What?
Okay, and then...

20:01.743 --> 20:06.304
and then, he was like,
"I'm gonna change my name

20:06.381 --> 20:08.726

to get away</i>

20:08.803 --> 20:11.018

20:12.496 --> 20:14.945

20:15.042 --> 20:20.185
And his sons, rumor have it,
they vowed to never pass on

20:20.262 --> 20:21.797
the Hitler name.

They deny it, but they've
never had kids, so...

20:26.988 --> 20:31.601
I think at the end of the day,
Willy Hitler got the last laugh.

20:31.875 --> 20:35.701
Ha ha ha.
