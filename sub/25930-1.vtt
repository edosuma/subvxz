02:26.076 --> 02:27.011
Any survivors?

02:28.879 --> 02:29.780
<i>Negative.</i>

02:31.514 --> 02:32.448
Tow it and burn it.

04:26.764 --> 04:31.236
<i>Um, hey, Brady. So, yeah,
the check bounced again.</i>

04:31.704 --> 04:33.572
<i>Hi, I'm calling
about an overdue pay...</i>

05:44.845 --> 05:46.579
My God. I can't believe
you hooked up with him.

05:47.381 --> 05:49.182
- Who didn't?
- Not me.

05:49.883 --> 05:52.153
Hmm. Well, who have you
been hooking up with?

05:53.620 --> 05:55.088
- Nobody.
- Nobody?

05:56.222 --> 05:58.591
Okay, not even kissed?
Anything?

05:59.093 --> 06:01.127
I'm just focusing on me
right now.

06:02.195 --> 06:04.163
Well, you're lucky
I'm in town,

06:04.165 --> 06:06.731
'cause I'm gonna find someone to
focus on you for a little bit.

06:08.034 --> 06:10.071
Can't we just go see
a movie, or something?

06:12.906 --> 06:14.275
I'm not gonna argue my way
outta this one, am I?

06:15.209 --> 06:18.145
I'm in law school. You can't
argue your way out of anything.

06:19.879 --> 06:21.048
Oh, my God.

06:24.018 --> 06:25.884
"Oh, my God" is right.

06:25.886 --> 06:29.123
Let's go. Whoo!

06:53.981 --> 06:56.850
I'm just saying. Whatever it takes
for you to get over her, man.

06:56.852 --> 06:58.918
There are other fish
in the sea.

06:58.920 --> 07:01.722
- It's complicated.
- You're making it complicated.

07:02.123 --> 07:04.757
Look, I'm here
to help you. Okay?

07:04.759 --> 07:07.960
- I didn't invite you.
- Nah. Best buds don't need invites, man.

07:07.962 --> 07:10.196
I'm looking
to find you some strange.

07:10.198 --> 07:12.465
Hey, baby! What's up, girl?
How you doin'?

07:12.467 --> 07:16.870
Look, this is my boy, here. He just got
broken up with recently. He's sad.

07:16.872 --> 07:20.038
So, I'm wondering, would you like
to, you know, bump uglies with him?

07:20.040 --> 07:21.310
Um, I'm good, thanks.

07:22.344 --> 07:24.678
Oh, you're good, thanks?

07:25.180 --> 07:26.446
Doesn't wanna have fun.
That's great.

07:26.448 --> 07:28.317
Dude,
Vancouver chicks suck, man.

07:38.393 --> 07:40.229
Jess, can you stand
over there?

07:41.096 --> 07:43.196
I wanna take a picture
of you in the skyline.

07:43.198 --> 07:44.867
I hate getting
my picture taken.

07:45.234 --> 07:46.866
All you need to do
is smile.

07:46.868 --> 07:49.738
- But I'm not good at this.
- Not good at what? Having fun?

07:50.071 --> 07:53.073
- Yes.
- Come on. You look so gorgeous.

07:53.075 --> 07:55.343
Ladies, would you like me to take
a picture of the both of you?

07:56.044 --> 07:57.411
Yes, please.

07:57.413 --> 08:01.149
Oh. Okay. Here,
get together. Get comfy.

08:01.850 --> 08:03.851
Like you're having fun.
That's great.

08:03.853 --> 08:05.085
So pretty.

08:06.088 --> 08:07.754
Amazing. Just flawless.

08:07.756 --> 08:09.192
Oh, well, thank you.

08:10.993 --> 08:14.194
So, listen, we're new in town.
We don't know anybody.

08:14.196 --> 08:17.231
- Are you two from here?
- Oh, I used to be.

08:17.233 --> 08:19.233
So I decided to visit
for the weekend.

08:19.235 --> 08:22.903
- Oh. See, we just graduated from Dartmouth.
- Ivy League, huh?

08:22.905 --> 08:25.039
Uh-huh.

08:25.041 --> 08:27.944
- Are you slumming it for the summer?
- No, we are not slumming it.

08:28.277 --> 08:30.911
Actually, my buddy here
just got dumped.

08:30.913 --> 08:32.413
So I'm trying
to make him feel better.

08:32.414 --> 08:34.782
He's all sad and lonely.

08:34.784 --> 08:35.418
Thanks.

08:37.820 --> 08:39.820
I'm Nicole,
and this is Jess.

08:39.822 --> 08:42.389
Well, this is Marty,
and I'm Lance.

08:42.390 --> 08:44.159
We should probably
head back.

08:45.062 --> 08:48.095
That's a great idea, Marty.
See, Marty has a boat.

08:48.097 --> 08:51.266
Would you ladies care to join us
to have a drink on that boat?

08:51.268 --> 08:53.769
- No.
- Absolutely. That sounds fun.

08:54.471 --> 08:57.005
Excellent.
What a great idea, Marty.

08:57.007 --> 08:59.842
Ladies, if you will please
follow me this way.

09:01.978 --> 09:03.378
Told you I know
what I'm doing.

09:03.380 --> 09:05.282
You're crazy.

09:05.815 --> 09:07.251
- Come on.
- No.

09:07.817 --> 09:09.351
- No.
- Come on.

09:58.436 --> 09:59.901
After you.

09:59.903 --> 10:01.838
Oh, Captain.

10:03.341 --> 10:04.841
Very nice.

10:06.644 --> 10:08.278
And what have we here?

10:09.347 --> 10:11.015
It looks delicious.

10:12.216 --> 10:14.520
Uh, yeah.
I have a great chef.

10:16.988 --> 10:17.854
So, this is your boat?

10:19.056 --> 10:22.958
Yes, it is.
Shall we, uh... have a seat?

10:22.960 --> 10:24.195
We shall.

10:24.595 --> 10:25.594
- Oh, shit!
- What?

10:25.596 --> 10:28.898
No, nothing. This guy
scared the shit out of me.

10:28.900 --> 10:30.401
- What's wrong?
- No, nothing.

10:31.235 --> 10:33.570
- I'll just get the door.
- No problem. Don't worry about me.

10:33.572 --> 10:35.473
I'm gonna get comfy
over here.

10:40.178 --> 10:42.513
- What are you doing here?
- Scheduled maintenance.

10:43.281 --> 10:44.882
Just a little work
on the engine.

10:46.352 --> 10:47.950
I'm not really supposed
to have guests.

10:47.952 --> 10:49.585
I've already been cleared
by the guard.

10:49.587 --> 10:51.290
Hey, man, can you
just do me a solid?

10:51.956 --> 10:54.258
I got this girl on board.
I'm trying to, you know...

10:58.597 --> 11:00.932
I got you, man.
You go have fun.

11:02.066 --> 11:03.268
Thanks, man. Appreciate it.

11:07.506 --> 11:09.108
All right. Where were we?

11:13.211 --> 11:14.379
What is this?

11:17.549 --> 11:20.352
Must've fallen out
of my pocket. Thank you.

11:21.654 --> 11:24.089
Thank you. Champagne?

11:43.609 --> 11:45.976
- You know how to open this?
- I... Yeah, of course.

11:45.978 --> 11:48.013
- It's, you know, it's sticking.
- Don't you have help?

11:48.480 --> 11:51.015
Uh... They're...
They're not here right now.

11:51.017 --> 11:54.454
- Private bubbles.
- Yes, exactly.

12:22.348 --> 12:22.982
What is he doing?

12:24.317 --> 12:25.485
Ah, he's telling him
to take a hike.

12:27.420 --> 12:29.587
I thought we were
getting on his boat.

12:29.589 --> 12:32.593
Ah, it's his dad's, you know.
He's a little overprotective.

12:33.327 --> 12:35.595
So, wait. That's the boat?

12:37.030 --> 12:37.630
Oh, yeah.

12:40.333 --> 12:42.268
So, this is how
the one percent lives.

12:42.702 --> 12:45.406
No, no.
The point-one-percent.

12:51.045 --> 12:52.379
Huh. Come with me.

12:53.481 --> 12:54.582
Come on.

12:57.318 --> 12:59.217
Somebody works out, hmm?

12:59.219 --> 13:01.787
You want a little champagne?

13:01.789 --> 13:04.189
- Just, like, a little.
- Okay.

13:04.191 --> 13:06.658
I haven't eaten.
So just, like, a little.

13:06.660 --> 13:09.730
- Sure. Good.
- Thank you, that's perfect.

13:10.664 --> 13:14.232
Oh. There it goes. That's a lot.
That's good.

13:14.234 --> 13:16.337
Oh, twist my arm.
Thank you.

13:17.137 --> 13:19.005
- There it is. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

13:23.644 --> 13:25.546
- Who is that?
- It's just...

13:28.549 --> 13:30.518
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, man.

13:31.385 --> 13:33.085
We're back.

13:33.087 --> 13:34.021
What's going on?

13:35.122 --> 13:38.158
Uh... Oh, I didn't expect
you guys back so soon.

13:39.226 --> 13:40.092
Not in uniform?

13:40.094 --> 13:42.427
You're looking good
in that jacket, man.

13:42.429 --> 13:46.231
Excuse me. You guys do know
that this is the captain, right?

13:46.233 --> 13:47.101
My date.

13:48.035 --> 13:50.135
Oh, well, permission
to come aboard, Captain.

13:50.137 --> 13:52.739
- Granted.
- Thank you.

13:52.741 --> 13:56.076
Well, since we're all here, maybe we can
join the festivities with you and...

13:56.745 --> 13:58.413
- Tina.
- Tina.

14:00.114 --> 14:01.246
Do you know these people?

14:01.248 --> 14:03.349
- Uh... Just give me a sec, okay?
- Yeah.

14:03.351 --> 14:04.753
I got this.

14:05.420 --> 14:07.352
Hey, guys, honestly, I'm sorry.

14:07.354 --> 14:10.790
But I've been planning this night for
a while and, you know, I got some...

14:10.792 --> 14:12.725
Maybe we can all hang out,
have a good time.

14:12.727 --> 14:14.595
You know, if that's cool?

14:14.597 --> 14:17.465
- Oh, Captain, my captain.
- Thanks, bro.

14:17.899 --> 14:19.634
Hey, man, you're not gonna
report this, are you?

14:21.369 --> 14:22.437
We'll talk about it later.

14:23.138 --> 14:23.605
Cool.

14:28.577 --> 14:30.145
Who are all these people?

14:30.745 --> 14:33.881
Um, well, these guys,
they work for me, so...

14:33.883 --> 14:36.618
- Oh, they work for you, huh?
- Yeah. I'm his first mate.

15:35.511 --> 15:36.445
Cocaine?

15:38.682 --> 15:39.650
Yeah.

15:57.334 --> 15:58.366
There you are.

15:58.368 --> 16:00.902
Oh, my God.
I am so sorry.

16:00.904 --> 16:02.706
Sorry, I didn't mean
to scare you.

16:04.241 --> 16:05.542
So, what do you think
of the yacht?

16:06.710 --> 16:08.443
Uh, it's definitely cramped.

16:08.445 --> 16:09.746
That's funny.

16:10.781 --> 16:12.749
Dad's actually thinking
about getting a bigger one.

16:13.583 --> 16:15.585
Wow. Who's your dad?

16:16.520 --> 16:17.854
Martin Hatfield Senior.

16:19.422 --> 16:22.526
Your dad is Martin Hatfield?
The CEO of Tridon?

16:23.260 --> 16:25.562
Yeah. We're in town
for a merger.

16:26.263 --> 16:30.032
Unbelievable. Your father is
literally destroying the planet.

16:30.034 --> 16:32.637
Do you have any idea how
much blood is on his hands?

16:33.037 --> 16:36.573
Look, it's not easy being the son
of the Martin Hatfield, okay?

16:37.274 --> 16:39.209
Do you think you're the first
person who's told me all that?

16:41.378 --> 16:42.679
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I was being rude.

16:43.914 --> 16:45.416
No, it's fine.
I'm used to it.

16:46.517 --> 16:46.984
Marty!

16:53.290 --> 16:53.925
Sorry.

17:08.606 --> 17:09.674
Christy!

17:15.680 --> 17:18.481
Christy. Please. Okay, it's not
at all what it looks like.

17:18.483 --> 17:21.717
I know I can explain everything,
just please come upstairs.

17:21.719 --> 17:24.288
I can't believe you
fucking invited her, dude.

17:25.423 --> 17:27.657
- Lance.
- You better go.

17:34.665 --> 17:35.767
Christy, please.

17:40.538 --> 17:42.805
"Don't drink all the mezcal."
And I do, of course.

17:42.807 --> 17:45.675
- Then I eat the worm, and he's flipping out.
- That's gross.

17:45.677 --> 17:47.911
And then the horse
comes in and I scream...

17:47.913 --> 17:50.347
- Can we talk?
- Just give me a minute, Jess.

17:50.349 --> 17:51.784
I wanna hear
the rest of the story.

17:52.416 --> 17:53.549
It's a good story.

17:53.551 --> 17:55.684
Then I have to stand up
with the horse.

17:55.686 --> 17:57.454
The horse looks me
in the face and he goes...

17:57.456 --> 17:59.388
God!

17:59.390 --> 18:01.824
Then I pulled the snap back and I
whip and I hit him in the face.

18:01.826 --> 18:03.462
Christy, please!

18:03.929 --> 18:05.329
Get the hell away from me.

18:19.945 --> 18:21.547
- Christy, please.
- Just save it.

18:22.581 --> 18:24.550
I'm too tired to drive home now.
I'm staying the night.

18:24.983 --> 18:27.553
Go back to your gangbang
or whatever.

18:28.654 --> 18:29.621
I'll be gone in the morning.

18:30.556 --> 18:32.623
Come on.
I didn't invite them.

18:32.625 --> 18:34.359
- Lance saw these girls...
- It is always Lance.

18:35.694 --> 18:37.496
And if you're not blaming him,
it's your father.

18:39.065 --> 18:40.834
You let them walk
all over you, Marty.

18:42.768 --> 18:43.802
At our expense.

18:46.172 --> 18:48.974
You know, I actually thought that
you could use some company tonight.

18:51.644 --> 18:52.846
I'm such an idiot.

18:55.547 --> 18:58.785
You know what? Forget it. I am taking a
shower to wake up, and then I'm gone.

20:56.638 --> 20:57.639
Come on.

21:11.553 --> 21:13.052
- Here comes the hero.
- Who's fourth?

21:13.054 --> 21:14.821
- Give me some.
- Look at the trees going by.

21:14.823 --> 21:16.189
That's so funny.

21:16.191 --> 21:19.258
Oh, my God.
We're moving!

21:19.260 --> 21:21.028
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

21:21.030 --> 21:22.196
Let's go talk to Marty.

21:26.869 --> 21:30.205
- I gotta... Just one second.
- You're much stronger than I thought.

22:06.342 --> 22:07.209
Where'd everyone go?

22:08.178 --> 22:11.211
Holy shit.

22:11.213 --> 22:13.748
What the hell
are you doing?

22:14.184 --> 22:15.716
Making the night
more interesting.

22:15.718 --> 22:17.153
Oh, God.

22:19.055 --> 22:21.122
What are you doing, man?
Your dad is gonna shit.

22:21.124 --> 22:22.823
- Relax.
- Fuck "relax."

22:22.825 --> 22:24.925
What are you gonna do?
You gonna protect me, Marty?

22:24.927 --> 22:26.063
- I'm calling him.
- Don't.

22:29.999 --> 22:31.867
Marty,
what are you doing?

22:32.235 --> 22:35.571
Oh, my God. Are you
doing this for her?

22:35.938 --> 22:37.939
Was kidnapping me
his idea, too?

22:37.941 --> 22:39.974
Just two hours
so we can talk.

22:39.976 --> 22:42.044
And if you haven't changed
your mind, I'll take you back.

22:42.745 --> 22:43.346
Okay?

22:45.215 --> 22:46.116
Two hours.

22:48.717 --> 22:50.087
You're crazy.

22:53.156 --> 22:55.089
- So romantic, Marty.
- That's so cute.

22:55.091 --> 22:56.958
That is really sweet, Marty.

22:56.960 --> 22:58.426
One peep out of you,
and Dad's gonna know

22:58.428 --> 23:00.928
all about your little order
of hooker and coke.

23:00.930 --> 23:02.730
- Hey, man, she's not a hooker.
- Why are we moving?

23:02.732 --> 23:05.733
Wait. Why are we moving?
Why are we moving?

23:05.735 --> 23:09.005
Yeah, Why the fuck are we
moving there, Captain Malcolm?

23:10.707 --> 23:11.808
Who the fuck is Malcolm?

23:19.850 --> 23:20.684
Who are you?

23:21.885 --> 23:22.652
Maintenance.

23:23.454 --> 23:24.754
On a raft?

23:25.155 --> 23:27.989
Yeah. There's lots
to check on a yacht.

23:27.991 --> 23:29.025
Gotta be thorough.

23:30.827 --> 23:31.795
Right.

23:32.796 --> 23:34.165
What the fuck is going on?

23:35.699 --> 23:38.868
You know, I can...
I can just explain this.

23:38.870 --> 23:42.003
Why don't we go upstairs
and have a quick little chat?

23:42.005 --> 23:44.108
You know?
It's good. It's cool.

23:45.143 --> 23:47.711
Oh, hey, man.
Hey, come down here.

23:48.146 --> 23:50.012
Hey, guys! Come on down.

23:50.014 --> 23:51.814
Who the fuck is that?

23:51.816 --> 23:53.317
This guy, he's working
on the engine.

23:55.152 --> 23:56.354
- Hey.
- Hey.

23:57.455 --> 23:59.488
Hey, unless you wanna
get stranded out here,

23:59.490 --> 24:01.991
I suggest you take her back.
Let me finish.

24:01.993 --> 24:05.427
We'll only be out here a couple of
hours, circle around for a bit.

24:05.429 --> 24:06.930
You fix things there.

24:08.933 --> 24:10.201
I'll double your money.

24:12.103 --> 24:14.239
- I don't want your money, kid.
- Triple.

24:15.940 --> 24:17.408
Fine, whatever you say.

24:23.948 --> 24:28.518
So, are you gonna man up and tell
me what the fuck is going on?

24:28.520 --> 24:29.954
Or do I have to figure
this out for myself?

24:33.225 --> 24:36.792
I've always wanted to sleep on
one of these. They're so comfy.

24:36.794 --> 24:38.696
Who said anything
about sleep?

24:40.199 --> 24:41.065
Oh...

25:34.120 --> 25:36.255
I could think of less
romantic settings.

25:57.577 --> 26:00.313
Erm, so, I'm Malcolm,
not Marty.

26:01.948 --> 26:04.949
And this was the first night
we were meeting in person.

26:04.951 --> 26:08.855
I wanted the night to be special.
So I'm sorry that I lied.

26:12.891 --> 26:15.962
Okay. Believe me,
it's not the first time.

26:28.475 --> 26:32.012
So, who is Malcolm?

26:33.047 --> 26:34.446
Well, I work on the boat.

26:34.448 --> 26:36.249
Oh, okay.
Well, what do you do?

26:37.450 --> 26:38.485
I'm the cook.

26:40.287 --> 26:41.187
Oh.

26:56.136 --> 26:57.838
Well, um...

26:59.073 --> 27:04.912
the appetizers, they looked...
delicious. They did.

27:09.149 --> 27:11.583
Oh. Well,
I didn't get to try one,

27:11.585 --> 27:15.555
so I'm gonna take a little
dabble in those appetizers.

27:15.557 --> 27:18.392
I'm gonna have a little sample, and
I'll be right back in two minutes.

27:46.688 --> 27:49.089
- How's the engine?
- Fine.

27:49.591 --> 27:51.124
Any problems?

27:51.126 --> 27:54.295
Nothing I can't handle.
Trust me, it's complicated.

27:55.062 --> 27:56.531
You're not really
a mechanic, are you?

27:57.999 --> 27:59.434
I haven't seen you
go near the engines once.

28:00.468 --> 28:03.371
- It's a big boat. And like I said, it's...
- Complicated?

28:05.240 --> 28:07.007
You just don't seem
like you should be here.

28:07.442 --> 28:09.578
I shouldn't. We should
still be back at the dock.

28:11.679 --> 28:14.581
What about you? How come you're not
having fun with all your little friends?

28:14.583 --> 28:16.584
Because they're not
my friends.

28:18.686 --> 28:20.456
Apparently, this is
Martin Hatfield's yacht.

28:23.024 --> 28:25.057
The CEO of Tridon Biotech.

28:25.059 --> 28:27.128
One of the biggest,
shadiest companies in the world.

28:27.496 --> 28:29.364
The merger.
Do you watch the news?

28:30.165 --> 28:31.698
Mechanics don't watch
the news.

28:31.700 --> 28:33.700
Well, Tridon is merging
with Silica,

28:33.702 --> 28:36.436
an even bigger, shadier company
based here in Vancouver.

28:36.438 --> 28:38.005
The two of them together
is like merging

28:38.007 --> 28:40.507
every major super-villain
to destroy the world.

28:40.509 --> 28:42.776
Come on. Aren't you being
a little dramatic?

28:42.778 --> 28:45.047
It's just another business
trying to make a buck.

28:46.014 --> 28:48.950
Are you kidding me?
They operate on greed.

28:49.451 --> 28:51.685
They cheat. They corrupt.
They're ruining our world.

28:51.687 --> 28:53.353
They're destroying
the environment.

28:53.355 --> 28:55.123
You basically just described
every company.

28:55.457 --> 28:57.626
Pollution,
animal testing, GMOs?

28:58.694 --> 29:01.329
That's the way the world works.
You'll figure it out one day.

29:02.666 --> 29:03.699
You know, when I was a kid,

29:04.935 --> 29:07.168
I used to love to go to this
point that overlooked the ocean.

29:09.038 --> 29:12.539
It had an incredible view.
Mountains, islands.

29:12.541 --> 29:15.478
My parents would let me wander around
looking for starfish or whatever.

29:16.445 --> 29:17.680
There was always seals there.

29:18.681 --> 29:20.582
And every once in a while,
if I was really lucky,

29:20.584 --> 29:22.318
I would see a pod
of killer whales swim by.

29:25.254 --> 29:27.489
One day, my parents bought me
a pair of binoculars

29:27.491 --> 29:29.358
and took me down to the point.

29:29.693 --> 29:31.258
And I was so excited
to see some seals,

29:31.260 --> 29:33.663
I just ran from the car
straight to my favorite spot.

29:35.498 --> 29:37.032
And that's when
I saw the whales.

29:38.635 --> 29:39.536
There was a dozen of them.

29:40.837 --> 29:42.338
Dead on the shore.

29:43.573 --> 29:45.775
Their eyes and organs
had been liquefied.

29:46.409 --> 29:48.143
There was blood
all over the rocks.

29:48.712 --> 29:51.679
Luckily, I was far enough away, but
there was another kid that day

29:51.681 --> 29:54.651
who wanted to get a closer look,
and he fucking died.

29:56.086 --> 29:58.054
He breathed in the fumes
and dropped dead.

30:00.189 --> 30:01.559
The Silica chemical spill.

30:02.325 --> 30:04.327
Do you remember
when that was on the news?

30:06.596 --> 30:09.566
Yeah, but I don't remember anything
about any whales or a dead kid.

30:09.867 --> 30:13.370
That's right. Because Silica
paid everyone off.

30:13.771 --> 30:16.271
The authorities,
politicians, the media.

30:16.273 --> 30:18.706
All the families that were
there that day, mine included.

30:18.708 --> 30:20.545
The world had no idea
what happened.

30:21.712 --> 30:23.313
How many times do you think
they've done that?

30:25.215 --> 30:26.651
They're not just a business.

30:28.251 --> 30:29.586
And they need to be exposed.

30:37.127 --> 30:37.762
Your name's Jess, right?

30:39.297 --> 30:40.462
Yeah.

30:40.464 --> 30:42.432
Jess, we're gonna
be here for a while.

30:43.266 --> 30:46.571
If you get bored, maybe make your
way to the office downstairs.

30:47.304 --> 30:49.239
I'm pretty sure there's stuff
in there you might wanna see.

30:53.744 --> 30:55.245
Well, I gotta get
back up there.

30:56.882 --> 30:57.782
The engine's that way.

30:59.784 --> 31:00.651
Right.

31:43.327 --> 31:43.862
Nicole.

31:45.464 --> 31:46.465
Hey, there.

31:48.532 --> 31:49.200
Nice bikini.

31:50.836 --> 31:53.304
Thanks. There's a bunch of them
downstairs. Want one?

31:54.205 --> 31:55.507
I don't think so.

31:56.475 --> 31:57.643
Any luck with Marty?

31:58.510 --> 32:00.344
- What?
- What about the mechanic?

32:01.212 --> 32:02.579
He's a babe.

32:02.581 --> 32:05.817
I don't wanna be here. We're
supposed to be hanging out.

32:07.284 --> 32:09.354
You're right. How about this?

32:10.555 --> 32:12.789
Once we leave the yacht,
we'll ditch these guys.

32:12.791 --> 32:15.494
And it'll just be you and me.
Like old times.

32:17.295 --> 32:17.829
I'd like that.

32:19.499 --> 32:22.634
Great.
Until then, yacht time.

32:28.908 --> 32:30.776
Ugh... What?

32:31.744 --> 32:33.613
Uh, we're gonna crash
into a fucking island.

32:39.018 --> 32:43.355
Fine. I'll go tell Marty.
Don't let it go anywhere.

33:00.907 --> 33:02.773
- Hey.
- What the hell, Lance?

33:02.775 --> 33:05.311
- Where's Marty?
- He went to look for you.

33:06.412 --> 33:07.848
Okay, so he's not gonna
be here for a bit.

33:09.016 --> 33:10.681
It's been a while.
We should catch up.

33:10.683 --> 33:12.316
Get the fuck away from me.

33:12.318 --> 33:14.351
I'm just looking for Marty.
What's the big deal?

33:14.353 --> 33:15.521
Please just go.
Thank you. Bye.

33:20.928 --> 33:22.361
You could really
get used to this.

33:23.396 --> 33:24.931
I've been on
a few of these before.

33:27.868 --> 33:29.402
I get entertained a lot.

33:32.940 --> 33:33.907
Are you a...

33:35.475 --> 33:37.509
No.

33:37.511 --> 33:40.013
No. Why does everybody
keep saying that?

33:40.514 --> 33:43.016
- I mean, you never know.
- No, absolutely not.

33:44.018 --> 33:46.451
I feel like I've got
conservative makeup on, too.

33:46.453 --> 33:47.888
Everyone's jumping
to conclusions.

33:51.792 --> 33:54.425
I found him.

33:54.427 --> 33:55.294
What's up?

34:00.033 --> 34:00.901
Ah, shit.

34:13.112 --> 34:14.847
- Hey, girls.
- Hey.

34:14.849 --> 34:17.882
- Sorry to break up your party, but...
- We're fine.

34:17.885 --> 34:20.518
No, we are drifting close to an
island, and we have to go inside.

34:20.521 --> 34:22.554
But I like it here.
It's nice. Pretty.

34:22.556 --> 34:24.822
- No. Come on, let's go.
- It's a weird angle.

34:24.824 --> 34:27.092
- There we go.
- Oh, jeez. Thank you.

34:27.094 --> 34:28.762
- You know what? I should help...
- She's fine.

34:35.668 --> 34:37.536
- Are you kidding me?
- Oh, that's perfect.

34:37.539 --> 34:40.407
I want off this boat.
And I want off this boat now.

34:46.781 --> 34:47.681
What happened, Marty?

34:48.549 --> 34:50.752
I don't know.
Go check the fuses.

34:51.052 --> 34:52.353
Fuses. Where are the fuses?

34:53.154 --> 34:54.554
How should I know?

34:55.489 --> 34:56.858
Where's
the maintenance guy?

34:59.427 --> 34:59.894
Hello?

35:01.062 --> 35:01.864
Hello?

35:13.174 --> 35:15.142
What the fuck did you do
to the engine, man?

35:15.144 --> 35:16.377
You can fix it, right?

35:18.847 --> 35:20.681
- Not sure.
- Wait, seriously?

35:20.683 --> 35:21.884
- Oh, my God.
- Amazing.

35:23.651 --> 35:25.485
Maybe we should radio
the Coast Guard.

35:25.487 --> 35:28.088
No! My dad cannot
find out about this.

35:28.090 --> 35:30.059
Why? Is he gonna
cut off your allowance?

35:30.692 --> 35:32.528
You can't let her
talk to you like that, Marty.

35:32.928 --> 35:34.594
All you trust-fund babies
are all the same.

35:34.596 --> 35:36.131
Excuse me?

35:36.898 --> 35:39.099
If Marty's dad finds out about
this, he'll cut all our dicks off.

35:39.101 --> 35:40.602
Yours too, Christy.

35:41.837 --> 35:44.037
We can radio the salvage yard
and get a tug to tow us out.

35:44.039 --> 35:45.908
They'll keep it off the books,
if you treat 'em right.

35:46.909 --> 35:49.176
- Sounds good, right, Marty?
- Fine, that works.

35:49.178 --> 35:52.615
- No, bad news. Radio's broken.
- What?

35:52.848 --> 35:55.649
- What are you using the radio for, bro?
- I was trying to call for help.

35:55.651 --> 35:58.785
- You don't use the radio, dude.
- Look, we're wasting time.

35:58.787 --> 36:00.055
Does anyone have a signal?

36:02.625 --> 36:04.426
What if Marty paid you
more money to fix it here?

36:06.896 --> 36:08.031
Ten thousand.

36:09.632 --> 36:11.765
Yeah, please. Come on, man.
You gotta do something.

36:11.767 --> 36:14.102
Fifteen and no promises.

36:14.104 --> 36:17.907
If I can't fix it by morning, we trigger the
emergency beacon. I still get the cash.

36:18.474 --> 36:19.207
Done.

36:19.209 --> 36:20.875
Do I get a say in this?

36:20.877 --> 36:23.710
Are you just gonna
pay him the $15,000,

36:23.712 --> 36:25.747
or is she gonna pay
the $15,000?

36:25.749 --> 36:28.484
Hold up, hold up, guys.
What's that?

36:31.621 --> 36:34.889
- Is that coming from the island?
- It could be a lighthouse.

36:34.891 --> 36:39.062
Maybe. Some of these islands have
marine facilities, cottages.

36:39.629 --> 36:41.563
Could find a radio-generator,
maybe even some parts.

36:41.998 --> 36:45.566
- Hey, sounds good to me.
- I'll take the Zodiac, you guys stay here.

36:45.568 --> 36:47.936
I'll be an hour or two, max.
If something happens to me,

36:47.938 --> 36:49.604
you still have
the emergency beacon.

36:49.606 --> 36:52.674
No, no. Why are we
listening to this dude?

36:52.676 --> 36:55.978
- Who the fuck are you, bro?
- He's the mechanic.

36:55.980 --> 36:58.846
Oh, he's the mechanic?
Marty, why are we doing this?

36:58.848 --> 37:00.715
Why are giving the boat
to this guy?

37:00.717 --> 37:04.652
- Okay, we'll go, too.
- Yeah, I got us into this mess.

37:04.654 --> 37:06.654
- We'll come with you.
- I'm coming.

37:06.656 --> 37:09.093
- No, no, look...
- No, you look. I've had enough.

37:09.826 --> 37:12.160
And I don't do
this whole stranded thing well.

37:12.162 --> 37:13.829
And I'm going
whether you like it or not.

37:13.831 --> 37:15.532
If she's going,
I'm going.

37:22.006 --> 37:23.006
Let's get drunk.

37:25.276 --> 37:26.243
You coming along?

37:27.144 --> 37:29.080
I'm gonna stay here
and check things out.

37:30.113 --> 37:31.882
Have fun with
your little friends.

37:40.590 --> 37:42.757
We should stay
in constant communication.

37:42.759 --> 37:43.761
Ten-four,
good buddy.

38:07.718 --> 38:09.620
Guys, there's something
in the water over there.

38:10.355 --> 38:12.223
It's the ocean, Tina. There's
a lot of things in there.

38:28.040 --> 38:29.339
Ah...

38:29.341 --> 38:31.174
I feel like I should be
with Jess.

38:31.176 --> 38:32.742
Mmm.

38:32.744 --> 38:35.746
Dude, she's fine.
Unless she wants to join.

38:36.747 --> 38:38.016
You're bad.

38:41.353 --> 38:42.653
I'm the worst.

39:30.303 --> 39:32.105
Oh... Of course.

39:44.817 --> 39:47.151
Lance, I need
to check on Jess.

39:47.153 --> 39:49.655
- Why?
- What do you mean, why?

39:51.791 --> 39:53.359
- What was that?
- Ah, who cares?

39:57.063 --> 40:00.299
Come on! Uhh! God.

40:12.044 --> 40:13.313
Anyone's phone working?

40:16.416 --> 40:18.184
Lance, we made it
to the island.

40:21.954 --> 40:22.623
Lance?

40:24.957 --> 40:25.893
<i>You there?</i>

40:28.995 --> 40:30.362
Unbelievable.

40:30.364 --> 40:32.299
It's Lance.
What did you expect?

40:34.334 --> 40:36.669
There's a path.
Let's take a look.

40:38.906 --> 40:39.672
Yippee.

41:11.905 --> 41:12.941
Jess?

41:14.342 --> 41:17.478
Ah, enough of this shit!
Come.

41:56.318 --> 41:57.185
Oh, shit!

41:59.220 --> 42:00.586
I saw something.

42:00.588 --> 42:02.154
Look. Over there,
over there.

42:02.156 --> 42:03.258
Over there.

42:06.094 --> 42:07.429
I think I see
something.

42:13.435 --> 42:14.769
What the hell was that?

42:15.870 --> 42:18.106
Oops, I hit
the wrong button.

42:18.907 --> 42:19.408
My bad.

42:20.975 --> 42:22.810
Great call bringing
the walkie-talkie, Marty.

42:24.279 --> 42:25.848
Seemed like a good idea
at the time.

42:44.634 --> 42:46.135
Oh, my God.

42:51.907 --> 42:52.374
What?

42:54.977 --> 42:55.545
Huh.

42:58.314 --> 42:59.381
What are you looking for?

43:02.918 --> 43:03.520
Lance?

43:04.553 --> 43:06.188
Someone's fucking with us.

43:06.555 --> 43:07.324
What are you doing?

43:10.926 --> 43:13.161
- Fucking back!
- You are not using that.

43:13.163 --> 43:14.164
Watch me!

43:29.978 --> 43:31.047
What the hell?

43:37.320 --> 43:38.519
- It's nothing.
- It's nothing?

43:38.521 --> 43:39.923
It looks like
a murder scene.

43:42.359 --> 43:43.492
There.

43:43.494 --> 43:44.527
Come on.

44:00.710 --> 44:02.480
Lance, put that thing away.

44:05.482 --> 44:06.549
What if you shoot Jess?

44:08.719 --> 44:10.120
There's someone else
on board.

44:13.257 --> 44:14.158
Jess, you out there?

44:17.494 --> 44:18.461
There's another person
on board.

44:21.565 --> 44:23.501
No fucking trespasser!

44:25.369 --> 44:26.437
Lance, you're scaring me.

44:29.607 --> 44:30.440
Come on.

44:41.185 --> 44:42.453
Oh, my God.

44:51.595 --> 44:52.563
What?

44:58.135 --> 44:58.602
What?

46:05.070 --> 46:06.238
What the fuck?

46:11.209 --> 46:12.377
No, no, no.

46:15.748 --> 46:16.682
What is this place?

46:34.734 --> 46:36.569
Is there anything in here
we can use?

46:37.670 --> 46:38.704
I don't think so.

47:04.196 --> 47:05.064
Nicole?

47:08.267 --> 47:08.769
Nicole?

47:43.805 --> 47:45.606
What was that?
What is this place?

47:46.540 --> 47:47.407
I don't know.

47:48.542 --> 47:51.678
I was just looking to have a little fun.
Live a little.

47:52.646 --> 47:56.149
Next thing I know, I'm sitting
on a log on a creepy island...

47:58.752 --> 48:00.320
in the middle of nowhere
with you.

48:00.855 --> 48:02.456
I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you.

48:03.323 --> 48:04.791
You're gonna pretend
I'm your girlfriend?

48:05.325 --> 48:05.859
Who's pretending?

48:07.328 --> 48:08.362
Oh, fuck.

48:11.698 --> 48:14.802
"Natural selection."

48:34.789 --> 48:35.657
There.

48:37.759 --> 48:39.394
- What?
- You don't see it?

48:43.331 --> 48:44.365
Will you go check it out?

48:45.533 --> 48:46.467
No.

48:54.877 --> 48:55.744
Please?

49:18.667 --> 49:19.535
What is it?

49:20.703 --> 49:23.304
I saw something.
Hang on.

49:38.287 --> 49:38.821
Malcolm?

49:41.690 --> 49:42.558
Malcolm.

49:50.766 --> 49:53.769
Oh, my God.
What happened here?

49:56.039 --> 49:56.906
Wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

50:02.011 --> 50:02.746
Look at this.

51:02.973 --> 51:04.074
What?

51:41.712 --> 51:42.680
Malcolm?

51:44.515 --> 51:45.416
Malcolm!

51:50.721 --> 51:51.822
Shit.

52:11.876 --> 52:12.911
Time to go.

52:13.545 --> 52:15.544
Hold on. Can't we use
any of this stuff?

52:15.546 --> 52:16.645
We're going now!

52:16.647 --> 52:18.817
There's something outside,
and I think it got Malcolm.

52:19.618 --> 52:20.552
Hide!

55:04.751 --> 55:06.919
- Let's go.
- What the fuck was that thing?

55:06.921 --> 55:07.955
Move! Come on!

55:52.767 --> 55:53.734
Nicole?

55:56.305 --> 55:58.773
Help! Jess!

56:00.108 --> 56:01.276
Where are you?

56:03.911 --> 56:05.113
- Jess!
- Nicole?

56:12.153 --> 56:13.956
Jess! Help!

56:31.840 --> 56:32.708
Jess?

56:58.734 --> 56:59.668
Nicole?

57:48.084 --> 57:49.119
Wait.

57:50.920 --> 57:51.821
Wait.

57:53.389 --> 57:56.227
Oh, no. Wait. Hold on.

58:23.886 --> 58:24.456
Nicole!

58:26.056 --> 58:27.258
Nicole!

58:35.566 --> 58:37.435
- Hey!
- Tina!

58:38.435 --> 58:39.503
Tina!

58:41.505 --> 58:43.972
Oh, my God.
What are we gonna do?

58:43.974 --> 58:45.442
We need to get back
to the yacht.

58:47.244 --> 58:48.113
No shit.

58:57.355 --> 58:58.289
Why's this happening,
Marty?

59:00.458 --> 59:01.326
I'm so sorry.

59:04.094 --> 59:05.396
I'm sorry, too.

59:08.099 --> 59:11.268
- For what?
- There's something I have to tell you.

59:13.138 --> 59:14.105
It's about me...

59:16.441 --> 59:17.342
and Lance.

59:26.451 --> 59:27.319
Nic?

59:49.675 --> 59:53.411
It's not my fault.
It's not my fault.

59:54.046 --> 59:56.047
- Nic?
- It's not my fault.

59:56.449 --> 59:59.515
- It wasn't my fault.
- Oh, my God!

59:59.517 --> 01:00:02.987
- It wasn't my fault.
- Lance, what did you do to Nicole?

01:00:04.155 --> 01:00:06.525
It wasn't me!
It was the fucking creature!

01:00:48.335 --> 01:00:49.236
You hear that?

01:01:48.162 --> 01:01:48.663
Marty?

01:01:50.297 --> 01:01:50.964
<i>Marty, are you there?</i>

01:01:51.598 --> 01:01:52.466
Marty?

01:01:54.135 --> 01:01:55.570
Marty, say something,
please.

01:01:57.237 --> 01:01:59.005
Please, I'm sorry.

01:02:01.075 --> 01:02:02.042
<i>Marty, can you hear me?</i>

01:02:05.045 --> 01:02:06.447
We've had a bit of
an accident.

01:02:13.321 --> 01:02:15.621
- He killed her!
- What?

01:02:15.623 --> 01:02:18.190
Lance!
He murdered Nicole!

01:02:18.192 --> 01:02:20.292
- What happened?
- He shot her with a spear gun!

01:02:20.294 --> 01:02:21.596
He fucking killed her!

01:02:26.834 --> 01:02:28.135
We have to get out
of here now.

01:02:29.604 --> 01:02:31.504
That's the plan.
Come with me.

01:02:31.506 --> 01:02:33.672
- Jess, where is he?
- He's in there.

01:02:33.674 --> 01:02:35.175
Go check on him,
but hurry!

01:02:37.078 --> 01:02:38.546
- Wait. Marty? Marty?
- Stay here!

01:02:58.466 --> 01:03:01.434
I didn't murder her, dude.
It was a fucking accident.

01:03:01.436 --> 01:03:04.738
I didn't even know it was her, man.
I was totally fucked up.

01:03:04.740 --> 01:03:06.241
She just barged in the room.

01:03:08.142 --> 01:03:12.812
I don't know, man. I just need to
know that you got my back. All right?

01:03:12.814 --> 01:03:15.517
That you're not gonna listen to that
bitch, that you're gonna trust me.

01:03:16.485 --> 01:03:17.653
Trust you?

01:03:19.354 --> 01:03:19.821
Yeah.

01:03:22.189 --> 01:03:24.293
Christy told me everything,
you piece of shit.

01:03:30.399 --> 01:03:31.199
What, that?

01:03:32.734 --> 01:03:36.804
Hmm? Dude, she was drunk.
I was drunk.

01:03:36.806 --> 01:03:39.308
Like, I don't even know
if anything happened.

01:03:39.808 --> 01:03:41.410
And even if it did,
who gives a shit?

01:03:42.244 --> 01:03:43.646
Fuck you!

01:03:47.749 --> 01:03:49.719
What are we going to do?

01:03:50.218 --> 01:03:52.521
We're all gonna get in the Zodiac
and get the heck outta here.

01:03:53.221 --> 01:03:56.557
I am not going anywhere with Lance.
He'll try to kill us!

01:03:56.559 --> 01:03:59.494
Jess, he wasn't lying about the
fucking creature, or whatever it was!

01:04:01.497 --> 01:04:03.633
- There was one on the island, too.
- Oh, my God.

01:04:04.834 --> 01:04:07.503
What? Where are Malcolm
and Tina?

01:04:11.774 --> 01:04:13.309
Oh, my God!

01:04:14.344 --> 01:04:17.745
Look. We need to find anything
that flashes or glows.

01:04:17.747 --> 01:04:19.882
Once we get away from the island,
we'll light it up and get rescued.

01:04:20.917 --> 01:04:23.753
- Okay?
- Okay. Okay.

01:04:51.514 --> 01:04:53.349
I've had enough
of your shit!

01:04:58.321 --> 01:04:59.722
We don't have time
for this shit.

01:05:00.591 --> 01:05:02.858
I went into the office, like you said.
I opened this book.

01:05:02.860 --> 01:05:04.762
There was all these pictures
of a creature inside.

01:05:05.561 --> 01:05:08.397
- Do you think Silica created it?
- Looks like it.

01:05:08.399 --> 01:05:11.734
And after what happened on that island,
let's just say I don't support the merger.

01:05:12.603 --> 01:05:14.772
I got everything we need to
expose these fuckers right here.

01:05:15.338 --> 01:05:16.239
Brady.

01:05:19.010 --> 01:05:19.943
Oh, shit.

01:05:30.421 --> 01:05:30.889
Marty.

01:05:32.523 --> 01:05:33.424
Oh, my God, Marty.

01:05:34.625 --> 01:05:36.226
Is that blood?

01:05:42.399 --> 01:05:43.400
Lance's.

01:05:46.403 --> 01:05:48.272
Marty,
what have you done?

01:05:54.279 --> 01:05:54.946
Marty.

01:06:02.053 --> 01:06:03.554
I'm so sorry.

01:06:06.558 --> 01:06:07.892
I'm so sorry.

01:06:11.696 --> 01:06:12.764
I love you.

01:06:16.034 --> 01:06:17.468
I love you, too.

01:06:38.456 --> 01:06:41.657
Christy! Christy!

01:06:41.659 --> 01:06:43.428
One of those things... Argh!

01:07:03.783 --> 01:07:06.285
Help! Help!

01:07:07.787 --> 01:07:09.820
- Help!
- Over here!

01:07:09.822 --> 01:07:11.023
Help us!

01:07:13.492 --> 01:07:14.326
Help!

01:07:15.594 --> 01:07:18.531
- Over here!
- Help!

01:07:19.465 --> 01:07:20.499
Help us!

01:07:24.503 --> 01:07:25.704
Help!

01:07:29.074 --> 01:07:30.376
Someone better see this.

01:07:44.090 --> 01:07:45.058
Oh, shit.

01:08:05.912 --> 01:08:07.881
- How many more do we have left?
- That's it.

01:08:08.615 --> 01:08:09.582
Brady!

01:08:14.921 --> 01:08:15.989
I'll hold it off
as long as I can.

01:08:17.057 --> 01:08:18.358
You gotta swim
to the Zodiac.

01:08:20.594 --> 01:08:22.160
- Brady, you don't have to do this.
- I know.

01:08:22.162 --> 01:08:24.964
Go! Now! Argh!

01:09:10.111 --> 01:09:12.478
Oh, my God. Thank you.

01:09:12.479 --> 01:09:16.984
There's been some kind of
creature, and we were attacked.

01:09:19.654 --> 01:09:20.488
What's going on?

01:09:36.504 --> 01:09:36.971
Help.

01:09:41.944 --> 01:09:43.111
We were attacked.

01:09:44.845 --> 01:09:47.112
- Were either of you bitten?
- What?

01:09:47.113 --> 01:09:49.149
- The creature, did it bite...
- No.

01:09:49.151 --> 01:09:50.518
Let her go.

01:09:54.690 --> 01:09:57.823
Stop. Stop.
What are you doing to me?

01:09:57.825 --> 01:09:59.493
Wait. Wait!

01:10:00.796 --> 01:10:03.529
Wait. Wait!

01:10:03.531 --> 01:10:06.001
- Why were we attacked?
- Jess, it's okay.

01:10:08.536 --> 01:10:12.541
Oh, my God. Lance?
Lance. What are you doing?

01:10:22.851 --> 01:10:23.852
Anyone else?

01:10:28.556 --> 01:10:30.093
You understand we can't
afford any witnesses.

01:10:34.863 --> 01:10:37.133
- Tow it and burn it.
- Wait.

01:10:39.668 --> 01:10:40.669
We're on the same side.

01:10:42.939 --> 01:10:43.872
I work for Silica.

01:10:44.706 --> 01:10:45.574
What?

01:10:46.842 --> 01:10:50.244
You work with them? This whole
time you knew about the island?

01:10:50.246 --> 01:10:51.880
You knew what
was gonna happen?

01:10:52.581 --> 01:10:53.581
It's not what you think.

01:10:53.583 --> 01:10:54.650
What is it, then?

01:10:55.985 --> 01:10:58.287
I was hired to retrieve some
items valuable to the company.

01:10:59.255 --> 01:11:00.590
Obviously,
it didn't go as planned.

01:11:01.591 --> 01:11:04.060
- What items?
- Research files.

01:11:05.361 --> 01:11:08.064
And something that I'm pretty sure
is an embryo of one of those things.

01:11:09.698 --> 01:11:10.699
Show me.

01:11:11.334 --> 01:11:12.635
Only if you let us go.

01:11:25.215 --> 01:11:26.115
We'll take the Zodiac.

01:11:33.056 --> 01:11:34.590
That is an embryo.

01:11:35.959 --> 01:11:37.094
A very special embryo.

01:11:40.930 --> 01:11:44.234
You actually believed they'd send
