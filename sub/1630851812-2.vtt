[sighs]

00:53.887 --> 00:55.013
[panting]

00:59.101 --> 01:00.727
[Deandre] Overrated.

00:59.101 --> 01:00.727
Overrated.

01:03.063 --> 01:05.107
Overrated!

01:10.821 --> 01:12.114
You all right.

01:15.200 --> 01:16.451
Yeah.

01:17.536 --> 01:18.537
No, son.

01:20.455 --> 01:22.124
I mean, you all right.

01:41.810 --> 01:42.936
Edwards.

01:44.229 --> 01:45.272
You're free to go.

02:00.078 --> 02:01.330
[sighs]

02:10.214 --> 02:11.465
You okay?

02:11.548 --> 02:13.592
Yeah, I'm okay. You?

02:14.968 --> 02:18.347
No. I'm really not.

02:18.430 --> 02:20.224
I know you hate coming down here
for your job.

02:20.307 --> 02:22.935
Definitely shouldn't be having you
come down here for me.

02:23.852 --> 02:25.145
I'm sorry, baby.

02:25.979 --> 02:27.397
You work on that speech all night?

02:27.481 --> 02:28.774
Not all night.

02:28.857 --> 02:30.567
You punched a coach, Ike.

02:31.318 --> 02:33.278
Who does that?
You having anger issues now?

02:33.362 --> 02:35.822
No, I got issues with assholes, baby,
and he was an asshole.

02:35.906 --> 02:37.658
So, you just gonna punch
every asshole that's out here?

02:37.741 --> 02:39.993
-That's-- That's not what I'm saying.
-So, what are you saying?

02:40.077 --> 02:41.745
I gotta be a better role model.

02:41.828 --> 02:43.789
This is not just about your team, Ike.

02:43.872 --> 02:46.166
I'm not talking about that team.

02:52.005 --> 02:53.006
Max called.

02:54.633 --> 02:58.220
Said that the coaches are meeting on
whether they should suspend you or not.

03:00.889 --> 03:04.226
He said you should go down there
and give them your side of the story.

03:04.309 --> 03:05.394
So they could play God?

03:06.353 --> 03:07.604
So you can keep coaching.

03:08.564 --> 03:09.815
If that's what you want.

03:11.400 --> 03:12.526
Take me to work.

03:13.110 --> 03:14.111
Yeah.

04:44.910 --> 04:47.037
-What up?
-Sleep, fool.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.122
People have been killing me online.

04:49.831 --> 04:53.627
So, clap back on the court.
You gotta reclaim that crown.

04:53.710 --> 04:55.045
You coming?

04:56.463 --> 04:57.464
Nah, I'm good.

04:57.548 --> 05:00.259
Your boot's off, right? Ankle's fine.

05:00.342 --> 05:02.636
Come get this work
before practice tomorrow.

05:04.137 --> 05:06.515
Unlike some people, I'm still number one.

05:07.933 --> 05:09.309
It's like that?

05:09.393 --> 05:13.397
Three weeks on injure reserve,
and I'm still number one, scrub.

05:13.480 --> 05:15.232
Bye. You suck.

05:28.829 --> 05:30.289
Hey, Mr. Reynolds.

05:31.206 --> 05:34.751
Hey, big time. You're in early.

05:35.294 --> 05:37.337
Yeah. You think I could get into the cage?

05:53.228 --> 05:54.688
Lock it when you're done.

05:54.771 --> 05:55.939
Thank you, sir.

05:59.693 --> 06:00.944
[door opens]

06:03.739 --> 06:04.740
[door closes]

06:18.003 --> 06:20.464
[exhales]

06:41.235 --> 06:42.736
Hey. Hey.

06:42.819 --> 06:43.820
[car alarm chirps]

06:46.865 --> 06:50.494
-Good to see you.
-I'm sorry about this. [indistinct]

06:53.038 --> 06:55.749
[man 1] I could dabble with 42%.
[indistinct]

07:04.049 --> 07:05.050
[man] Lightbulbs.

07:10.138 --> 07:12.057
You give any more thought about
what I asked you about?

07:12.140 --> 07:13.976
Ike, now is not a good time.

07:14.059 --> 07:18.814
Sheila, I'm about to be a father
in five months. You feel me?

07:18.897 --> 07:21.066
You can't keep kicking me
to the curb like this.

07:21.149 --> 07:22.651
I'm not trying to
disrespect the situation,

07:22.734 --> 07:24.111
but I gotta figure something out.

07:24.194 --> 07:26.405
I can't give you a raise right now,
Ike. I'm sorry.

07:27.656 --> 07:28.699
You got extra hours?

07:29.283 --> 07:30.617
Haven't we done this dance before?

07:31.952 --> 07:35.497
Every time a shift opens up, you can't
take it because of your coaching stuff.

07:37.332 --> 07:41.503
That was before.
Now, I got other priorities.

07:41.587 --> 07:44.840
Might be a weekend shift.
Ain't that when you have games?

07:44.923 --> 07:48.302
[sighs] I'm saying, I'll take the hours.

07:49.219 --> 07:52.598
All right.
All right, Ike. I'll see what I got.

07:52.681 --> 07:55.225
-I appreciate it.
-Mm-hmm.

07:56.852 --> 07:58.896
Do you think we'll need a cart?
Should we grab one?

08:02.983 --> 08:05.110
[sighs] You lost or something?

08:06.486 --> 08:08.280
-Was in the neighborhood.
-Hmm.

08:11.116 --> 08:12.117
Thanks.

08:14.286 --> 08:16.997
It was a pretty bold move
skipping the coaches meeting.

08:17.080 --> 08:19.625
If y'all want me on my knees begging,
that ain't me.

08:19.708 --> 08:23.045
So, we looking at a four,
five-game suspension?

08:23.837 --> 08:24.838
No.

08:25.923 --> 08:26.924
Whole season?

08:27.007 --> 08:28.550
Coach Max got everyone
to give you a second chance.

08:28.634 --> 08:29.885
Bullshit.

08:29.968 --> 08:32.261
And I convinced Deandre
not to press charges.

08:32.346 --> 08:33.679
How'd you get him to do that?

08:33.764 --> 08:36.015
-Severance.
-You fired that guy?

08:36.099 --> 08:39.727
Yeah. And he had to go.
He was messing with my brand.

08:40.729 --> 08:43.023
Overtime called his behavior "unbecoming."

08:43.106 --> 08:47.402
If you're not here to deliver bad news,
what are you here for?

08:47.486 --> 08:51.615
You and I both know that your program
is barely holding on financially.

08:52.199 --> 08:53.450
You don't know my situation.

08:53.534 --> 08:55.160
So what? I'm wrong?

08:56.703 --> 08:59.331
You've got some
pretty decent role players.

08:59.414 --> 09:02.501
And you know you don't have to be
an asshole to be a good coach.

09:03.669 --> 09:07.172
But your team is not strong enough to hold
on to a kid like Jace Carson long-term.

09:07.756 --> 09:09.258
Especially if you keep losing.

09:09.341 --> 09:11.009
Where are we going with this?

09:11.510 --> 09:13.095
I wanna join you.

09:13.178 --> 09:15.848
I'm proposing that you and I
merge our teams.

09:17.307 --> 09:19.518
I'm gonna handle all the business, the PR.

09:19.601 --> 09:22.187
I'll deal with all the opinionated parents

09:22.271 --> 09:25.440
and give you the space that you need
to be the great coach you are.

09:26.024 --> 09:28.694
What makes you think I care
about being a great coach?

09:30.946 --> 09:31.947
I guess I don't.

09:32.030 --> 09:33.156
Exactly.

09:33.240 --> 09:36.285
I mean, I can't imagine how much
of your life you've given to this game.

09:36.368 --> 09:37.786
No, you really can't.

09:37.870 --> 09:38.871
Here's what I can imagine.

09:38.954 --> 09:44.168
I have ten to 13Us in my program.
The money I make, I give you a cut.

09:45.377 --> 09:48.547
I can imagine with our combined
collection of talent,

09:48.630 --> 09:50.632
that we'd be the best in the DMV.

09:50.716 --> 09:54.678
What I can't imagine
is you walking away from that, Ike.

09:54.761 --> 09:57.055
Not seeing how much you care about Jace.

09:57.639 --> 09:59.975
Not seeing how much
you still care about the game.

10:02.644 --> 10:06.523
[woman on radio] Italy now has the largest
coronavirus death toll outside China.

10:06.607 --> 10:09.902
Authorities there announced
49 more deaths on Friday,

10:09.985 --> 10:12.905
bringing the overall toll
to just shy of 200.

10:13.405 --> 10:15.616
[woman on radio]
As the economic impact starts to sink in,

10:15.699 --> 10:20.454
the Italian tourism industry is already
predicting losses of six billion…

10:21.163 --> 10:22.164
My baby.

10:27.586 --> 10:29.087
[horn honks]

10:37.763 --> 10:40.015
[woman] You're gonna be fine, all right?
Use your words.

10:50.943 --> 10:54.363
[Apocalypse Anne] Famines and pestilence
and frightful sights!

10:54.446 --> 10:55.739
Heed my words!

10:55.822 --> 10:57.616
Heed my words!

10:58.367 --> 11:00.577
For the end of the world is upon us!

11:01.828 --> 11:05.499
Nation shall rise against nation
and kingdom against kingdom!

11:06.667 --> 11:10.003
Find redemption, brother.
For the end of the world is upon us.

11:10.087 --> 11:12.464
And great earthquakes
will be in diverse places.

11:15.509 --> 11:17.010
Heed my words!

11:21.515 --> 11:22.558
Yes?

11:23.350 --> 11:26.103
Hi, I'm Coach Ike. Is your mom home?

11:26.186 --> 11:28.188
Not yet, but Jace is.

11:28.272 --> 11:30.816
Jace! Your coach is here!

11:30.899 --> 11:31.900
Just a minute.

11:34.403 --> 11:35.445
-Aight.
-Yeah.

11:37.531 --> 11:38.699
Hey, what happened?

11:39.408 --> 11:40.826
Time to go!

11:41.326 --> 11:45.831
No, not again! He keeps throwing it!

11:52.129 --> 11:53.130
Sup, coach?

11:53.213 --> 11:54.214
What's up?

11:56.258 --> 11:57.676
They said you got locked up.

11:59.094 --> 12:00.095
Yeah.

12:03.348 --> 12:04.349
Why'd you punch him?

12:05.934 --> 12:09.813
Maybe… I would've wanted somebody
to do the same thing for me.

12:10.814 --> 12:12.316
Maybe I just got issues.

12:14.359 --> 12:15.819
Yeah, you definitely got issues.

12:17.654 --> 12:18.822
How you doing?

12:21.116 --> 12:22.784
Hard to sleep last night.

12:23.702 --> 12:25.537
Kept seeing that shot rim out.

12:26.914 --> 12:32.002
I mean, I'm a 90% free throw shooter.
What the hell, right?

12:32.753 --> 12:33.754
What the hell.

12:37.257 --> 12:40.135
I was trying to kick it
with you and your mom but…

12:41.762 --> 12:43.514
I guess I'll just let you know.

12:44.723 --> 12:46.391
We're merging with another team.

12:46.475 --> 12:48.727
-What team?
-Team All Day.

12:49.728 --> 12:52.272
Yeah. I don't know
what you've been smoking.

12:52.356 --> 12:53.440
Hear me out.

12:54.316 --> 12:59.071
The dude I punched ain't a part of it. And
they got some guys that can help us out.

12:59.154 --> 13:01.532
You scored 31 points last game.

13:01.615 --> 13:03.200
One assist.

13:03.283 --> 13:04.535
And all your points came in the paint,

13:04.618 --> 13:07.037
so by fourth quarter,
it was easy to key in on you.

13:07.120 --> 13:08.872
So, you saying it's all on me?

13:08.956 --> 13:10.457
The loss is on me.

13:11.291 --> 13:13.502
I need to put better pieces around you.

13:13.585 --> 13:17.089
We need to develop your mid-range,
and I need four to five assists a game.

13:17.673 --> 13:20.133
I need you to not just be the best player.

13:20.843 --> 13:22.719
I need you to be the most valuable.

13:24.388 --> 13:27.474
We making cuts, and tryouts are tomorrow.

13:28.058 --> 13:29.226
I'm not trying out.

13:29.309 --> 13:30.644
I'm not asking you to.

13:31.395 --> 13:32.896
I just need you to show up.

13:40.821 --> 13:42.406
-What's up, Meg?
-Hey, Royale.

13:42.489 --> 13:43.615
Good luck, son.

13:43.699 --> 13:48.370
All right. That should hold you down.
New jerseys, incidentals.

13:52.249 --> 13:53.375
Thanks, Brett.

13:53.458 --> 13:56.545
Let's see if some of these
SP Grind parents are as invested

13:56.628 --> 13:58.547
-as I've always been.
-[car doors closing]

13:59.548 --> 14:01.425
-Okay. All right.
-See you soon.

14:15.397 --> 14:17.316
Hey, Jace. You showed, huh?

14:17.399 --> 14:19.610
You lucky she fired that
loudmouth son of a bitch,

14:19.693 --> 14:22.070
or we sure as hell wouldn't be here.

14:22.154 --> 14:23.697
And she still let it happen.

14:24.740 --> 14:26.241
Meg is good people.

14:27.951 --> 14:29.161
And she made things right.

14:30.662 --> 14:32.164
How well do you know her?

14:33.248 --> 14:34.249
I know her…

14:35.626 --> 14:36.627
kind of.

14:36.710 --> 14:40.631
All right, look, she played at Syracuse.
She knows the game.

14:41.381 --> 14:42.549
She knows what it takes,

14:42.633 --> 14:45.385
and she's committed to helping me
build a strong program.

14:46.803 --> 14:51.892
Ike, I don't want Jace to be team-hopping.
I need this to work.

14:52.601 --> 14:54.895
Look, I'm not even trying
to come at you like that.

14:55.812 --> 15:00.108
But Overtime, that was the biggest stage
he's ever played on.

15:00.192 --> 15:01.568
And now we got these haters.

15:01.652 --> 15:04.488
These grown-ass men
trying to tear him down online.

15:04.571 --> 15:06.406
People love to see people fail.

15:06.490 --> 15:09.243
Jace can't. Not again.

15:10.953 --> 15:13.455
And just so you know,
my son's being raised to understand

15:13.539 --> 15:16.166
that violence isn't the way
we resolve our problems.

15:16.792 --> 15:17.793
Understood.

15:19.878 --> 15:21.296
It was a pretty right hook, though.

15:24.341 --> 15:26.343
Come on. Let's go.

15:29.930 --> 15:31.348
One protected pick each, right?

15:32.307 --> 15:33.433
That's right.

15:33.934 --> 15:36.645
-No, I got ball!
-There you go. Come on!

15:36.728 --> 15:37.938
Who's down there?

15:39.898 --> 15:41.441
Come on, shoot it. Shoot it.

15:44.403 --> 15:45.779
Oh, yeah. I got ball.

15:55.831 --> 15:58.250
We almost catch an elbow? My bad.

15:59.710 --> 16:00.919
I got two, I got two.

16:08.135 --> 16:11.221
I just want everyone to know,
you're all ballers,

16:11.305 --> 16:12.806
whether you make the team or not.

16:12.890 --> 16:17.144
Here are the ten.
If I call your name, walk to half court.

16:17.227 --> 16:18.854
Jace Carson.

16:20.564 --> 16:21.565

-It's all you, bro.

-I know you got it.

Those who didn't get their names called,

17:30.926 --> 17:36.515
Coach Naim will be here holding open gym
on Thursdays to work on skills.

17:39.935 --> 17:41.854
I could hook you up
with other teams, if that's--

17:41.937 --> 17:44.481
You know what, man? This some bullshit.

18:03.333 --> 18:05.294
[Sawyer] Hey, Jace! Ready for you, man.

18:08.338 --> 18:09.506
Take a book while you're up.

18:21.101 --> 18:23.979
All right.
Y'all teammates now, aren't you?

18:24.563 --> 18:27.649
So, Jace, um, who you fittin'
to lock down this weekend?

18:28.233 --> 18:29.693
Anacostia Elite.

18:29.776 --> 18:32.070
-Ain't that the team with the Darius kid?
-Mm-hmm.

18:32.154 --> 18:35.449
Oh, boy. That boy there a beast,
now, hey. [chuckles]

18:35.532 --> 18:37.159
[man] Your opponent is irrelevant.

18:37.242 --> 18:39.203
Mental toughness is the key.

18:39.286 --> 18:42.039
I don't know if that can be taught,
but without it, you won't get far.

18:43.207 --> 18:45.250
Didn't your old man
break that down for you?

18:46.210 --> 18:48.670
[Sawyer] All right, now.
Leave the boy alone, all of you.

18:49.254 --> 18:52.424
Don't listen to them. Be like your mans
here. Focus on those books.

18:53.008 --> 18:54.384
So that's what it's like, huh?

18:55.511 --> 18:57.304
Everyone and their cousin
got something to say to you.

18:58.514 --> 19:01.433
On the regular. You?

19:02.643 --> 19:06.021
They say someone as big as me
got no excuse not to make it.

19:06.104 --> 19:09.233
[man] Always wondering why our kids
want to be ballplayers and rappers.

19:11.318 --> 19:13.654
Is all that true about your moms?

19:14.947 --> 19:16.156
That she's locked up?

19:18.825 --> 19:20.118
Why?

19:20.869 --> 19:22.120
Just askin'.

19:28.293 --> 19:29.378
Whatever, man.

19:31.004 --> 19:35.050
She's in Jessup,
but she'll be on parole soon.

19:35.759 --> 19:36.760
That's good.

19:41.223 --> 19:43.183
How long you take
to get them dreads right?

19:43.267 --> 19:46.979
-Locs.
-My bad. Locs.

19:47.062 --> 19:51.066
Mmm. It's a while,
but my mom says it's like a journey.

19:51.817 --> 19:54.862
That locs represent spiritual strength.

19:56.989 --> 19:57.990
That's what's up?

20:02.327 --> 20:04.413
You are all set, Mr. Phil.

20:04.496 --> 20:06.540
-Thank you, Miss Melony.
-You're welcome.

20:08.667 --> 20:11.587
So what's your hair story?

20:11.670 --> 20:13.922
-My what?
-Your hair story.

20:14.006 --> 20:17.092
You gotta cut a swoosh
in that jont. Something.

20:17.176 --> 20:18.635
Get a swoosh so we can win?

20:18.719 --> 20:20.971
You sure she didn't
tie them locs too tight?

20:26.560 --> 20:27.728
But for real, though.

20:27.811 --> 20:30.105
What Coach Deandre did,
clowning you and all that?

20:57.799 --> 21:00.260
Mom, I need that check
for my step show costume.

21:00.344 --> 21:01.553
It's a week late now.

21:01.637 --> 21:06.642
Okay. I get paid Thursday,
so I'll get you a check on Friday.

21:06.725 --> 21:07.935
All right, thanks.

21:12.648 --> 21:13.649
Hey.

21:14.316 --> 21:15.651
Hey. You hungry?

21:15.734 --> 21:18.904
I dropped in the DMV rankings, Ma.
From one to four.

21:20.781 --> 21:22.866
I told you not to look.

21:22.950 --> 21:25.869
No one's gonna think
I'm elite if I keep sinking, Ma.

21:25.953 --> 21:28.830
We're not drinking from that haterade,
all right?

21:28.914 --> 21:31.041
Focus on what's ahead of you. Here.

21:32.793 --> 21:33.836
-What's that?
-Darius Metcalf.

21:33.919 --> 21:37.005
You're about to face him.
And the Anacostia boys, they don't play.

21:37.089 --> 21:41.343
You told me to stay off social media, but
you in here checking for Darius Metcalf?

21:41.426 --> 21:43.804
This ain't chatter. This is education.

21:43.887 --> 21:45.472
Look at this sneaky sneak move.

21:46.139 --> 21:48.141
He uses his right to get you off balance,

21:48.225 --> 21:50.561
and then he blocks your shot
with his left.

21:50.644 --> 21:53.480
But with the slickness,
so the refs don't see.

21:53.564 --> 21:55.065
Let me show you.

21:56.149 --> 21:57.734
Jackie, you're Darius.

21:58.402 --> 22:00.946
-Why I gotta be ugly old Darius?
-Why you think?

22:01.029 --> 22:02.030
-Man.
-Yo!

22:02.114 --> 22:04.324
Okay, that was good,
but do it again, slowly.

22:04.408 --> 22:08.579
Okay, this time, you ready.
You go in there first with your left.

22:08.662 --> 22:10.372
And now you're the one coming for him.

22:10.455 --> 22:12.249
And then what, Coach Mamavich?

22:12.332 --> 22:15.002
Then, my son,
you dunk on his sorry behind.

22:18.046 --> 22:19.047
Man, you craze--

22:21.258 --> 22:23.218
What the hell did Sawyer do to your hair?

22:23.302 --> 22:25.304
-It's called a swoosh.
-A what?

22:25.888 --> 22:27.431
It's for my hair story.

22:30.100 --> 22:32.019
-You don't have to do this.
-Of course I do.

22:32.853 --> 22:34.104
You seem happy to be here.

22:34.188 --> 22:35.314
And you don't.

22:35.397 --> 22:38.984
I'm tired. I have heartburn.
And my breasts are swollen.

22:39.067 --> 22:43.906
I offer massage therapy, 24-7,
rain, shine or sleet.

22:43.989 --> 22:44.990
You're a good dude, Ike.

22:46.325 --> 22:49.661
I just want to make sure everything
is right before the baby comes.

22:49.745 --> 22:50.746
It will be.

22:51.705 --> 22:53.790
I want everything to be right with you.

22:53.874 --> 22:55.334
I'm working on that.

22:56.376 --> 22:57.503
What does that mean?

22:57.586 --> 23:00.714
I mean, I'm trying, with you, the team.

22:57.586 --> 23:00.714
I mean, I-I'm trying, with you, the team.

23:01.590 --> 23:05.219
If this merger goes through, it'll go
from a hobby to paying some bills.

23:05.302 --> 23:06.929
We got a lot of those coming.

23:08.138 --> 23:09.681
Think it could work out?

23:09.765 --> 23:12.434
If we lose our next game,
his mom isn't having it.

23:12.518 --> 23:16.730
Jace'll be gone, and I don't want him
to end up with one of these

23:16.813 --> 23:18.982
"What have you done for me lately" coaches
out here.

23:20.776 --> 23:23.946
-So don't lose.
-[scoffs] Yeah, that's it? That's all?

23:24.029 --> 23:26.073
-It's brilliant, right?
-Mm-hmm. You think you funny.

23:26.156 --> 23:28.075
[chuckles] I am funny.

23:28.158 --> 23:31.286
Finally, some appreciation
for a brother out here.

23:31.370 --> 23:33.080
I make an extra 30 look sexy.

23:33.163 --> 23:36.667
[chuckles] Now I want you to bend over
and try to tie your shoes.

23:39.837 --> 23:42.881
-Ain't no shoes down there.
-[chuckles]

24:56.413 --> 24:58.957
There's the hardest working man
in the DMV.

25:03.337 --> 25:04.963
I heard you spoke up for me.

25:05.797 --> 25:06.924
I appreciate that.

25:07.633 --> 25:08.634
No problem.

25:09.468 --> 25:11.929
But I don't want you to feel like
you owe me. We square.

25:12.930 --> 25:13.972
That's nice of you.

25:14.640 --> 25:16.892
We may have our differences,
but we family.

25:16.975 --> 25:20.020
-We family now?
-I always thought of you as a son.

25:20.103 --> 25:22.147
Busted my nuts to help you.

25:23.357 --> 25:25.984
Whatever you busted,
you busted for yourself.

25:27.236 --> 25:28.820
Feel like you rewriting history, Ike.

25:28.904 --> 25:31.615
When you quit playing,
your head was all screwed up.

25:31.698 --> 25:34.409
After your pops died,
may he rest in peace…

25:36.286 --> 25:37.287
you spiraled.

25:37.871 --> 25:39.831
I ain't no cause and effect
of why you flamed out.

25:39.915 --> 25:43.126
I tried to be there for you.
But you shut me out.

25:43.710 --> 25:45.128
See, you shuttin' me out now.

25:45.212 --> 25:46.839
-'Cause you wanna be here?
-Yeah.

25:47.756 --> 25:50.133
And I heard you merged
with the white girl.

25:50.217 --> 25:51.802
If you need help, why not come to me?

25:51.885 --> 25:54.930
Cocky little sumbitch like Jace
need strong brothers around him

25:55.013 --> 25:56.765
who know how to handle they business.

25:56.849 --> 26:00.310
What Jace need is a coach
that don't look at him like a payday.

26:00.394 --> 26:02.980
Chew him up, spit him out,

26:03.063 --> 26:04.690
right when shit get tough.

26:04.773 --> 26:08.068
Let's be clear.
I'm the reason you got games to coach.

26:11.780 --> 26:16.285
For a minute, I thought you wanted me
to help you get a piece of Jace.

26:16.910 --> 26:18.328
But just like you explained,

26:18.412 --> 26:20.414
me playing for you for all them years?

26:21.248 --> 26:22.583
We square.

26:24.668 --> 26:29.923
Good as Jace Carson is, he wasn't
as scrappy as you, but he is good.

26:31.300 --> 26:35.012
And you and I both know you gonna
screw things up like you always do.

26:35.596 --> 26:37.347
'Cause you can't change who you are.

26:43.145 --> 26:44.271
Come on, boy. Work!

26:45.355 --> 26:47.858
They say you suck. They say you all hype.

26:48.692 --> 26:50.527
What you say? Come on.

26:51.445 --> 26:55.699
Come on, Carson. Come on, Carson.
Come on, Carson. Let's go!

26:59.119 --> 27:00.996
Finish that! Come on.

27:01.079 --> 27:02.206
Overrated!

27:02.289 --> 27:05.334
Don't let 'em be right.
Don't let 'em be right, Jace.

27:05.417 --> 27:07.419
-Overrated!
-Come on. Attack them!

27:12.007 --> 27:13.717
What, you mad?

27:13.800 --> 27:17.304
I'd be mad too.
You only made 30% of your shots.

27:17.387 --> 27:22.184
But if you come here, get 300 shots
up a day, you could get that to 50%.

27:22.267 --> 27:23.560
But you gotta commit.

27:23.644 --> 27:26.647
-What does it look like I'm doing?
-It look like you sulking.

27:26.730 --> 27:30.526
How you gonna block the outside noise
if you in your head all day?

27:31.360 --> 27:34.404
People don't just roll out of bed
with mental toughness, Jace.

27:34.488 --> 27:37.407
You gotta put the mental
with the physical.

27:37.491 --> 27:40.285
If haters come at you,
that is a compliment.

27:40.369 --> 27:43.288
Embrace that negativity,
that's what I want for you.

27:43.372 --> 27:44.706
What you want for me?

27:46.875 --> 27:49.086
Come on, coach.
We don't gotta pretend here.

27:49.169 --> 27:51.380
-What?
-This ain't about nothin' you want for me.

27:51.463 --> 27:53.507
This is about you trying
to rebuild your program.

27:54.883 --> 27:55.968
Ain't that why we here?

27:57.761 --> 28:01.640
All right.
I'm trying to rebuild my program.

28:01.723 --> 28:04.685
And I got a lot better chance
if you don't suck.

28:04.768 --> 28:06.854
But maybe there's something
you wanna rebuild.

28:09.022 --> 28:11.942
I wanna be ranked number one
in the DMV again.

28:12.025 --> 28:14.194
And I want us to make it to Florida.

28:16.363 --> 28:17.364
Why?

28:18.365 --> 28:19.449
What you mean "why"?

28:19.533 --> 28:21.451
You gotta have a "why."

28:27.082 --> 28:28.083
It's personal.

28:28.667 --> 28:34.298
Well, personally
I think rankings are bullshit.

28:35.549 --> 28:37.426
But at your age…

28:39.761 --> 28:41.513
it was everything to me too.

28:42.472 --> 28:44.433
Look, I can't be wrapping your Pampers.

28:45.726 --> 28:47.394
You gotta put the work in.

28:48.187 --> 28:50.522
If not, I won't waste your time.

29:02.701 --> 29:05.120
-Let's get it.
-Oh, yeah.

29:05.204 --> 29:09.541
I love it. I love it. Let's go.

29:11.376 --> 29:14.755
-Come on.
-Yeah, let's go, Jace! Let's go!

29:16.089 --> 29:17.883
Yeah! I love it!

29:20.302 --> 29:22.304
Energy just wasn't the same without you.

29:23.805 --> 29:26.767
Just being able to watch you play,
beautiful stuff.

29:31.438 --> 29:32.773
How's that feel?

29:33.899 --> 29:35.776
-It's okay.
-Good.

29:38.820 --> 29:43.200
Yeah. I know a couple of coaches
at the University of Maryland.

29:47.579 --> 29:48.956
I was telling them about you.

29:50.666 --> 29:53.210
My future D1 star.

29:58.340 --> 30:03.804
I mean, it's a ways away, but I told them
I could see you fitting in their system.

30:04.930 --> 30:06.682
Hey, Frankie! How's it going?

30:06.765 --> 30:09.351
Can't complain. My in-laws
finally moved back to Orlando.

30:09.893 --> 30:11.019
Where you going?

30:11.103 --> 30:12.354
I need to go home.

30:12.437 --> 30:14.648
But we haven't iced it yet.

30:14.731 --> 30:16.275
Good job. Good job. Go!

30:20.320 --> 30:21.780
Nice!

30:21.864 --> 30:23.115
Gotta swish that.

30:24.199 --> 30:26.285
-Work, Moo, work.
-Help, help!

30:26.368 --> 30:28.036
-There you go.
-Switch, switch, switch.

30:28.787 --> 30:31.498
Hey, yo!
What the hell is your problem?

30:31.582 --> 30:34.334
What my problem is you suck.
Everybody know that.

30:34.418 --> 30:36.170
-Okay.
-I suck at riding the bench like you.

30:36.253 --> 30:38.922
-Chill, bruh.
-Say that again.

30:39.006 --> 30:41.383
-You a scrawny-ass ho, bruh.
-What, you his bitch now?

30:41.466 --> 30:42.718
-Who you calling his bitch?
-Hey!

30:48.974 --> 30:50.142
Back up.

30:50.225 --> 30:52.519
Okay. All right, I got you.

30:52.603 --> 30:55.856
Y'all can't play as a team,
y'all gonna suffer as one!

30:55.939 --> 30:58.275
Baseline, everybody!

31:00.110 --> 31:01.695
I told you.

31:01.778 --> 31:03.739
We had nothing to do with it.

31:03.822 --> 31:05.240
Stupid.

31:05.324 --> 31:07.034
We paying for your mistake.

31:07.117 --> 31:08.327
Who this?

31:08.911 --> 31:10.495
Back in the days when I was young

31:10.579 --> 31:12.080
I'm not a kid anymore

31:12.164 --> 31:14.666
But some days I sit
And wish I was a kid again

31:14.750 --> 31:16.835
-Back in the days
-Old people, coach.

31:16.919 --> 31:18.212
Wrong answer.

31:19.004 --> 31:21.924
It's Ahmad. Down and back. Go!

31:22.883 --> 31:24.384
-Let's go, Vince. Come on.
-Go!

31:24.468 --> 31:27.262
-Come on. Run, boy!
-All of y'all! What you doing? Go!

31:28.180 --> 31:31.266
-Suffer as a team!
-I don't know what that was.

31:31.350 --> 31:32.684
Gonna call Ahmad "old people."

31:32.768 --> 31:34.561
Thought his pops
raised him better than that.

31:36.313 --> 31:37.314
Next one.

31:41.109 --> 31:42.110
Classic.

31:46.990 --> 31:47.991
Hello?

31:48.075 --> 31:50.410
-I wish I was a little bit taller
-Fresh Prince.

31:51.578 --> 31:53.163
Nah. It's LL Cool J.

31:53.247 --> 31:55.082
Bro, he's an actor, you idiot.

31:55.165 --> 31:57.167
So is Fresh Prince, genius.

31:57.251 --> 31:58.418
Skee-Lo!

31:58.502 --> 31:59.837
Who's that?

32:01.797 --> 32:04.341
It doesn't matter. Down and back.

32:11.390 --> 32:12.474
Interesting drill.

32:12.558 --> 32:15.310
Coach! Can we get someone
from this century?

32:15.394 --> 32:17.479
Okay if I have your phone
for a sec, coach?

32:19.940 --> 32:21.316
Two Five?

32:21.942 --> 32:24.111
I'll give you someone from this century.

32:25.279 --> 32:27.030
I'll start with local royalty.

32:27.114 --> 32:29.324
Yeah, ride down the block
In an Escalade

32:29.408 --> 32:30.909
Bling-bling all in your face

32:30.993 --> 32:32.828
I think you might need
To put on your shades

32:32.911 --> 32:34.788
-Rah!
-I know you feel me doe

32:34.872 --> 32:36.331
You hatin' on me
But you hear me doe

32:36.915 --> 32:38.166
Twenty-inch rims sittin' crazy low

32:38.250 --> 32:39.251
That's Cardi.

32:40.294 --> 32:42.671
Honey. That's Missy Elliott.

32:43.255 --> 32:44.256
What you doing?

32:44.339 --> 32:47.384
That wack swoosh in your head
done scrambled your brain.

32:49.428 --> 32:51.722
-You need a headband, bro.
-Your momma roasted you.

32:51.805 --> 32:55.392
What y'all doin'? Run! You got it wrong.
You get it wrong, you gotta run.

33:01.982 --> 33:02.983
Hey, Jackie.

33:03.066 --> 33:04.943
This be smackin'.

33:05.027 --> 33:06.570
Yo, Royale, what took you so long?

33:06.653 --> 33:08.530
You were in there looking
for all those missed passes?

33:09.198 --> 33:11.116
Bruh. It took him a minute
to get my sandwich.

33:11.200 --> 33:13.202
-Sandwich?
-At the Carry-Out?

33:13.285 --> 33:16.205
He's just a turkey sandwich-eating
brother. That's just how he roll.

33:16.288 --> 33:19.249
No, he better roll that mess
somewhere else, Royale.

33:19.333 --> 33:21.919
See, all the other stuff on the menu
is just decoration.

33:22.002 --> 33:23.003
Fact.

33:23.086 --> 33:25.547
See, the only concern here
is the number one.

33:25.631 --> 33:27.591
-That's why they call it number one.
-Yep.

33:27.674 --> 33:29.676
-See, you got your wings--
-Double fried.

33:29.760 --> 33:30.969
-You got your fries--
-Shoestring.

33:31.053 --> 33:32.763
-Thank you, Drew.
-Don't forget the mumbo.

33:33.347 --> 33:35.474
Yes, Mr. Carson.
See, I was just about to get to that.

33:36.058 --> 33:40.687
See, this right here is the secret weapon
to the whole operation.

33:41.563 --> 33:43.690
Eddie's mumbo sauce.

33:43.774 --> 33:44.858
Preach.

33:45.692 --> 33:47.528
This right here is some next-level shiz.

33:48.862 --> 33:52.908
50% sugar, 50% toxic waste, 100% magic.

33:53.534 --> 33:54.785
Allah be praised.

33:54.868 --> 33:55.953
Allah be praised.

33:56.036 --> 33:57.829
Royale, I'm gonna ask you
this one more time.

33:57.913 --> 33:59.373
You still gonna eat that sandwich?

34:02.626 --> 34:03.919
Really, Royale?

34:04.002 --> 34:06.839
Yo, if you can't get the simple rules
of the Carry-Out right,

34:06.922 --> 34:08.549
how are we supposed to figure out
a team name?

34:08.632 --> 34:13.011
Coach says up to us.
I say we stay SP Grind.

34:13.512 --> 34:14.929
I say we stay Team All Day.

34:16.014 --> 34:18.058
All right. All right.
What about a compromise?

34:19.101 --> 34:20.185
Grind All Day.

34:20.726 --> 34:21.812
Grind All Day?

34:22.396 --> 34:24.523
We should call ourselves, Swagger.

34:26.775 --> 34:28.193
-I rock with that.
-Yeah.

34:28.277 --> 34:29.444
-I'm feelin' that.
-You know that.

34:29.527 --> 34:30.696
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

34:33.072 --> 34:34.074
All hail Swagger.

34:34.157 --> 34:35.742
-Swagger.
-All hail to Swagger.

34:35.826 --> 34:37.244
-To Swagger!
-To Swagger.

34:38.370 --> 34:39.371
-Come on.
-Get in here.

34:39.454 --> 34:40.455
-Yes, sir.
-Yeah.

34:40.539 --> 34:42.875
-On three! One. Two. Three.
-Swagger!

34:45.752 --> 34:46.795
Hey!

34:46.879 --> 34:48.922
I don't care what you say.
That's garbage.

34:50.382 --> 34:52.217
Your vegan ass
don't know what you're missing.

34:52.301 --> 34:53.552
Watch your mouth!

34:53.635 --> 34:54.928
Mom's here.

34:58.307 --> 34:59.308
Sorry, Miss J.

34:59.391 --> 35:00.684
Bye, scrub.

35:01.810 --> 35:03.187
Oh, man.

35:03.270 --> 35:06.273
How's he holding up after that last game?

35:06.356 --> 35:07.357
He's okay.

35:07.900 --> 35:11.486
And you? How was your first practice back?

35:11.570 --> 35:13.030
It was fine, I guess.

35:13.113 --> 35:17.951
Well, it'll be a lot easier
when we get these out.

35:20.329 --> 35:21.622
They really weigh you down.

35:23.415 --> 35:27.377
After practice,
Coach Warrick was looking at my ankle.

35:27.461 --> 35:30.047
Is it okay? Did you twist it again?

35:30.130 --> 35:31.882
No. It's fine.

35:32.591 --> 35:33.884
Thank God.

35:33.967 --> 35:35.135
It's just…

35:37.012 --> 35:42.601
he said he was telling
some of Maryland's coaches about me

35:43.185 --> 35:44.937
and how special I was.

35:48.357 --> 35:49.566
But it didn't…

35:51.527 --> 35:52.861
It felt weird.

35:53.570 --> 35:55.739
Like, not right, you know?

35:55.822 --> 35:59.952
I do. I've felt that way myself.

36:00.786 --> 36:01.828
Really?

36:03.830 --> 36:06.500
They call it the "impostor syndrome."

36:07.125 --> 36:12.130
Where everyone else can see
how good you are, how special.

36:12.214 --> 36:13.590
And you can't.

36:13.674 --> 36:17.219
Makes you think you're a fraud. A failure.

36:17.845 --> 36:18.846
I don't know.

36:19.471 --> 36:23.058
Baby, he is not talking about
the University of Maryland

36:23.141 --> 36:25.227
with any of the other girls on the team.

36:25.894 --> 36:27.312
I guarantee you.

36:28.105 --> 36:30.357
Because you are special.

36:41.743 --> 36:44.872
Hey, Ike. You got the shift.

36:44.955 --> 36:46.707
Every weekend, 10:00 to 6:00.

36:49.084 --> 36:50.169
The shift.

36:50.252 --> 36:53.672
Yes, the shift.
The extra hours you begged me for.

36:54.381 --> 36:57.676
-Right.
-Yeah. I took them away from Ronnie.

36:57.759 --> 36:59.761
He's kinda pissed. Yeah.

36:59.845 --> 37:01.013
But when you gave me that

37:01.096 --> 37:03.849
speech about your baby
on the way and your priorities…

37:03.932 --> 37:05.517
Yeah, that was a pretty good speech.

37:05.601 --> 37:07.769
Pat yourself on the back, brother man.

37:07.853 --> 37:11.648
The deal is the coaching stuff
kinda picked up.

37:12.316 --> 37:16.361
-Picked up?
-Yeah, and I got a game tomorrow.

37:17.237 --> 37:19.656
I think this is something
I need to see through.

37:19.740 --> 37:23.827
Don't ask me for any more favors, Ike.
You understand?

37:24.620 --> 37:26.538
-I understand.
-Shut up.

37:33.837 --> 37:35.422
-Hey.
-Hey.

37:36.340 --> 37:37.841
Rankings guy showed up.

37:38.509 --> 37:42.137
Are you talking about dude that looks like
he never played a day of ball in his life?

37:42.221 --> 37:45.849
Be nice. Higher Jace is ranked,
the higher our profile.

37:45.933 --> 37:49.102
Yeah, well, if we lose this game, we
won't have to worry about Jace Carson.

38:07.287 --> 38:08.288
Swagger!

38:08.872 --> 38:11.625
Huddle up. Everybody, bring it in.

38:12.292 --> 38:16.129
I just want to encourage y'all
to just show up.

38:19.174 --> 38:20.175
Show up?

38:22.052 --> 38:23.053
That's it?

38:23.136 --> 38:24.763
Yeah, Drew. That's it.

38:26.014 --> 38:29.685
Hey, coach. Maybe you should work on
your pre-game speeches a little more.

38:32.855 --> 38:34.356
No offense.

38:34.439 --> 38:36.900
Sometimes when it feels
like everybody's against you,

38:36.984 --> 38:38.610
hardest thing to do is show up.

38:41.029 --> 38:43.365
All right then, let's show up!

38:45.742 --> 38:49.204
Swagger on three!
Swagger on me! One. Two. Three.

38:49.288 --> 38:50.497
Swagger!

38:50.581 --> 38:53.292
-Let's go!
-Starters, you know who you are!

38:53.375 --> 38:56.211
Right. Ready for battle.

39:19.985 --> 39:22.279
Get that! Get that! Get that!

39:22.362 --> 39:25.240
Get down court! What are you doing?

39:27.618 --> 39:28.827
Drew, what are you doing?

39:35.125 --> 39:38.879
Worried about some pandemic? We've
been living the pandemic for 400 years.

39:38.962 --> 39:40.047
Who's this dude?

39:40.130 --> 39:43.759
How's your ankle?
Jace says you back in action.

39:43.842 --> 39:48.388
Yeah, it's fine. Hurts a little sometimes.
But, you know, I'm good.

39:48.472 --> 39:51.808
Good. You ready
to put 'em in the frying pan?

39:52.935 --> 39:54.102
What?

39:54.186 --> 39:55.270
Girl, never mind.

39:55.354 --> 39:56.855
Defense!

39:57.731 --> 39:59.733
Defense! Defense!

39:59.816 --> 40:00.859
Bring it.

40:06.615 --> 40:08.283
Come on, Jace! Finish it!

40:14.498 --> 40:16.250
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

40:18.001 --> 40:19.336
Yeah!

40:20.003 --> 40:21.255
Defense, defense.

40:26.760 --> 40:29.221
Carson don't want it! He scared!

40:29.304 --> 40:31.723
That's why he passed it to Larry Birdshit!

40:32.891 --> 40:35.143
Hey, bruh. Keep shooting, man.
You can't suck all game.

40:35.227 --> 40:36.228
Thanks, dude.

40:36.311 --> 40:37.896
Coach! Coach!

40:37.980 --> 40:41.608
You need another shooter, coach!
Put Royale in!

40:50.993 --> 40:52.578
Your boy is nice.

40:53.620 --> 40:55.372
-He real nice.
-Ain't he, though?

40:55.455 --> 40:56.832
It's yours, Jace!

40:58.041 --> 41:01.086
If it wasn't for Ike's coaching,
y'all be up by 20 by now.

41:12.431 --> 41:14.016
That's a foul!

41:17.978 --> 41:19.730
Jace, don't let him push you like that!

41:25.360 --> 41:26.987
Bro, don't even worry about it.

41:32.367 --> 41:33.785
Overrated!

41:39.208 --> 41:40.792
Overrated!

41:45.714 --> 41:47.382
Overrated!

41:52.804 --> 41:55.349
Hey. Keep your sorry ass on the bench.

42:00.437 --> 42:02.606
Can't afford to lose this game, coach.

42:04.149 --> 42:05.275
Not you.

42:06.652 --> 42:07.653
Not me.

42:10.948 --> 42:13.116
And I'm coaching like I can't afford to.

42:14.826 --> 42:16.578
How about we stop playing not to lose…

42:17.621 --> 42:18.914
and start playing to win.

42:32.219 --> 42:35.264
Attack. You hear me? Attack.

42:37.808 --> 42:39.351
Let's go win this game.

42:43.897 --> 42:44.898
Hit it!

42:51.697 --> 42:54.283
Come on, kid. Come on, kid.

43:06.003 --> 43:07.504
Yes, sir!

43:09.464 --> 43:13.093
-Watch your middle. Watch your middle.
-Yeah! Hit that.

43:33.030 --> 43:34.239
My bad.

43:36.617 --> 43:38.619
Let's go! Let's go!

43:45.501 --> 43:47.544
Yeah! Yeah!

43:48.253 --> 43:50.714
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

44:01.767 --> 44:02.768
Oh, my God.

44:05.354 --> 44:06.980
What I'm talking about, baby!

44:08.815 --> 44:10.192
Let's go, Jace!

44:25.832 --> 44:27.125
-Good game.
-Thanks, coach.

44:31.797 --> 44:33.090
Yeah.

44:37.761 --> 44:39.263
You know I got you.

44:45.435 --> 44:47.479
My rankings update will post tonight.

44:51.316 --> 44:52.776
Hey, coach.

44:53.610 --> 44:58.407
That right there is how you get it done.
By showing up, showing out.

44:58.907 --> 44:59.908
Yeah.

45:00.659 --> 45:04.788
That press break adjustment you made?
Had 'em shook!

45:04.872 --> 45:07.249
They ain't had no answer for that.
[chuckles]

45:09.126 --> 45:11.587
-And look, all them haters.
-Let's see.

45:13.839 --> 45:15.382
And your boy about to get
his number one spot back.

45:15.465 --> 45:16.466
[chuckles]

45:21.096 --> 45:22.347
End up like me?

45:24.933 --> 45:26.894
They mean a handsome as hell,
cool-ass brother

45:26.977 --> 45:28.896
with a beautiful wife
and a flawless J, right?

45:28.979 --> 45:31.356
-Yeah, that's what they meant.
-[chuckles] Yeah.

45:33.150 --> 45:34.818
Embrace the negativity, right, coach?

45:36.111 --> 45:37.279
You got to.

45:39.865 --> 45:43.160
Hey. You never told me what your "why" is.

45:45.954 --> 45:47.956
How about I get back to you on that?

45:48.040 --> 45:50.626
Enjoy your win. You did your thing.

45:52.628 --> 45:54.588
Aight. Get home safe.

45:58.300 --> 45:59.426
[sighs]

46:28.455 --> 46:31.667
This is nothing. I'm just
letting them bring their complaints.

46:32.292 --> 46:34.962
All right. Play. Come on. Put that over…

46:43.220 --> 46:44.388
Hello?

46:44.471 --> 46:46.849
Maryland Correctional Facility for Women.

46:46.932 --> 46:51.270
This call may be recorded or monitored.
To accept this call, press five.

46:52.896 --> 46:54.523
Hello? Mom?

46:54.606 --> 46:57.985
Phil?
It's so good to hear your voice.

46:58.068 --> 46:59.695
I miss you so much.

46:59.778 --> 47:03.240
But I don't have long,
so tell me everything. How's school?

46:59.778 --> 47:03.240
But I-- I don't have long, so--
so tell me everything. How's school?

47:03.991 --> 47:07.703
It's good. But the big news is that
my team merged with another one,

47:07.786 --> 47:10.038
and we're called Swagger now.

47:10.122 --> 47:13.625
Swagger. Oh, I know you livin' up to that.

47:13.709 --> 47:16.753
Trying to.
I'm playing with Jace Carson now.

47:16.837 --> 47:19.256
Jace? I thought you two didn't get on.

47:20.215 --> 47:22.384
Nah. He's all right.

47:23.135 --> 47:25.012
And your father? How's he doing?

47:25.804 --> 47:28.932
He's… good. He's still at work.

47:29.016 --> 47:32.811
That's good. I'm glad
y'all are looking out for each other.

47:32.895 --> 47:36.315
You still got your locs?
Or did you go for the clippers?

47:36.398 --> 47:39.776
Still got 'em. Miss Melony
down at Sawyer's tightened 'em up.

47:39.860 --> 47:42.279
But the ends are still fuzzy, though.

47:42.362 --> 47:43.780
It means your locs are maturing.

47:43.864 --> 47:46.742
Y-You cut off the end
and it'll weaken the entire loc.

47:46.825 --> 47:49.411
Then it won't be strong enough
to face all the twisting and turning

47:49.494 --> 47:50.996
that's coming in the future.

47:51.079 --> 47:52.748
[chuckles] I won't touch it then.

47:52.831 --> 47:56.251
When I get home,
I'll be taking care of you myself.

47:57.127 --> 47:58.378
How much longer?

47:59.671 --> 48:03.091
Parole board hearing's,
i-it's not for a few months.

47:59.671 --> 48:03.091
Parole board hearing's,
it's not for a few months.

48:03.175 --> 48:05.260
But maybe you can come visit.

48:05.844 --> 48:08.472
I'm gonna try. I really want to.

48:08.555 --> 48:09.806
My time's up, baby.

48:09.890 --> 48:12.559
-I'm gonna dedicate my next game to you.
-I gotta go.

48:13.143 --> 48:15.020
Mom? Mom?

48:17.940 --> 48:18.982
I love you.

48:22.778 --> 48:24.988
Them rankings gotta be up by now.
Let's see.

48:26.990 --> 48:28.325
What?

48:29.117 --> 48:31.537
It's crazy how they have somebody
ranked higher than you.

48:32.704 --> 48:34.248
He moved from Puerto Rico
to the DMV.

48:35.374 --> 48:36.542
Dope highlight reel.

48:37.084 --> 48:39.127
A highlight reel doesn't mean
he's better than me.

48:39.211 --> 48:41.046
You'll find out when you play him
next week.

48:43.340 --> 48:45.425
-Damn!
-What?

48:45.509 --> 48:48.053
He got 40,000 followers.

48:48.136 --> 48:51.306
Mostly girls. I can't read Spanish,

48:51.390 --> 48:54.643
but heart eye emojis
are definitely universal.

48:54.726 --> 48:57.354
Beyoncé has followers too.
Don't make her a baller.

48:57.437 --> 48:59.982
Beyoncé's magic. She might be.

49:02.234 --> 49:03.277
Double damn!

49:03.819 --> 49:05.946
Hey… I don't know
who's number one on the court,

49:06.029 --> 49:08.782
but he's definitely number one
in thirst traps.

49:08.866 --> 49:10.951
No. I thought we were here to hoop.

49:12.953 --> 49:15.247
Yo, Crystal.
You sure you wanna keep playing?

49:15.330 --> 49:18.458
Last person I lost to was my father,
and that was a long time ago.

49:30.888 --> 49:32.264
Hibachi!

49:34.558 --> 49:36.018
Keep talking.

49:47.362 --> 49:49.323
-Game point.
-Let's go, scrub.

49:50.199 --> 49:51.408
You ain't ready for this.

50:00.417 --> 50:02.294
It's raining Skittles!

50:08.717 --> 50:09.718
Best out of three?

50:09.801 --> 50:12.554
If you wanna get schooled like that.
Let me just grab some water first.

50:18.644 --> 50:19.978
So, how was first practice back?

50:21.188 --> 50:24.233
-It was okay. Stop sweating me about it.
-Just okay?

50:24.316 --> 50:26.235
You moving like this,
coach better recognize.

50:26.318 --> 50:27.319
Jace.

50:29.821 --> 50:32.032
Coach gonna give you the same shots
and minutes as before,

50:32.115 --> 50:33.158
or he gonna make you earn it?

50:35.244 --> 50:37.037
I said stop sweating me about it. Damn.

50:39.414 --> 50:40.958
Okay, best out of three.

50:47.881 --> 50:49.967
Come on, you know
you wanna keep them Skittles.

50:50.634 --> 50:51.718
Crystal!

51:10.571 --> 51:11.613
What were you thinking, Ike?

51:11.697 --> 51:13.365
Just listen to me, Dad.

51:37.556 --> 51:38.557
Too easy.

51:41.810 --> 51:43.228
Mouse in the house.

51:45.022 --> 51:48.317
Weight room. Weight room. Swish!

51:53.780 --> 51:55.616
Think you can stay in front of me, boy?

51:56.241 --> 51:57.451
Taste this, cleca.

52:02.623 --> 52:05.292
Comin' for you, boy.
Taking back what's mine.
