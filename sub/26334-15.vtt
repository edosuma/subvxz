10:24.304 --> 10:25.804
Of course. Sorry.

10:25.873 --> 10:27.050
You looking for Erin's office?

10:27.074 --> 10:28.573
- Yes.
- Yeah, it's that way.

10:28.642 --> 10:30.575
Uh, thanks. Thanks so much.

10:30.644 --> 10:31.576
Yeah, but you're going this way.

10:31.645 --> 10:33.945
- Um, um, I'm sorry, what?
- With me.

10:34.014 --> 10:35.547
No, I have an
appointment with Erin.

10:35.616 --> 10:38.550
Had. She got called to court,
so you got me instead.

10:38.619 --> 10:39.851
Now, let's go.

10:39.920 --> 10:40.920
Go?

10:42.623 --> 10:43.788
You ask a lot of questions.

10:43.857 --> 10:45.657
That's gonna be a problem
out in the field.

10:45.726 --> 10:47.225
Out in the field?

10:47.294 --> 10:48.627
It's fine in here,
but out there,

10:48.695 --> 10:49.895
I do the talking.

10:49.963 --> 10:52.330
Keep your yap closed
and your ears wide open.

10:52.399 --> 10:53.732
You hear?

10:53.800 --> 10:55.634

Yeah, the one used

Trial starts in a couple

11:05.512 --> 11:09.948

An officer in your house?

No, one of the kids

Hector Ruiz. Just got
a full scholarship

14:30.291 --> 14:31.457

Do we run a rec center

No. But we do believe

Commissioner, I know that
everything I got going here

15:12.100 --> 15:14.267

every rule in the book.

15:28.016 --> 15:31.384
We cops use a lot

15:31.452 --> 15:34.253
how we call
our precincts houses.

Bring enough people in,
it becomes a home.

- No.

17:33.041 --> 17:34.740
The gun isn't there, Angela.

17:34.809 --> 17:37.576
So whatever deal you had
is null and void and kaput.

17:37.645 --> 17:39.656

- Yeah.

- Let's call daddy!
- No. No, no!

17:42.817 --> 17:45.284

Angela could alwa...

17:49.190 --> 17:50.289
Okay.

17:52.160 --> 17:54.727
But you can't tell anyone

18:34.402 --> 18:36.368
- So, nothing?
- Not nothing.

18:36.437 --> 18:37.770
She said something about

18:37.839 --> 18:41.107
the kid's girlfriend.

18:41.175 --> 18:44.176
They had an intense
relationship.

18:44.245 --> 18:46.245

18:48.015 --> 18:50.149
- How intense?
- Don't know.

18:51.886 --> 18:53.086

a lot of sense,

was hard to make sense of.

text messages from

19:03.731 --> 19:05.030
the girlfriend to her son.

19:05.099 --> 19:06.632
The girlfriend was
rough on him.

19:06.701 --> 19:08.634
"Get a job, get a life."
Stuff like that.

19:08.703 --> 19:11.036
Okay, that's something.
Let's dig into his phone.

19:11.105 --> 19:12.938

Uh, Rose... Rachel.
Something with an "R."

19:15.610 --> 19:16.742

19:21.582 --> 19:23.816
- Rebecca.
- Close enough.

19:23.885 --> 19:25.885

line up telling you

20:13.668 --> 20:15.601
You're no idiot,
that's for sure.

20:15.670 --> 20:19.138
And for my money,
you're not even upside down,

20:19.207 --> 20:21.574
just maybe a little sideways.

20:24.145 --> 20:25.411
If that's what you see...

20:25.479 --> 20:27.513
You know what else I see?

20:27.582 --> 20:30.916
Uh, my dining room table?

20:30.985 --> 20:33.619
Your empty house.

20:33.688 --> 20:35.287
It's not empty.

20:37.158 --> 20:39.425
Sean's upstairs
doing his homework.

20:39.493 --> 20:41.393
Not what I mean,

20:41.462 --> 20:42.928
and you know it.

20:42.997 --> 20:46.198
And it's not just the house
that's empty.

20:48.135 --> 20:51.403

two years yet, Gramps.

20:51.472 --> 20:54.873

you through those others.

20:54.942 --> 20:57.443
She also could've
gotten you through this one.

20:57.511 --> 21:00.946
Yeah, but it wasn't
in the cards.

21:01.015 --> 21:03.148

- Why not?

a dozen times for promotion

and one of the guys

29:22.358 --> 29:26.059
who leapfrogged over him
was Clifford.

29:26.128 --> 29:29.096
And maybe a little because
he's white and Clifford's black.

29:29.164 --> 29:30.864

33:38.260 --> 33:40.560
Pardon the
interruption.

33:40.629 --> 33:43.864
I just wanted to give
our superstar a little gift.

33:43.932 --> 33:45.265
Pineapple pizza?

33:45.334 --> 33:47.567
You had to be there.
Got it.

33:47.636 --> 33:49.214
Well, I got to go get
ready for the roll call.

33:49.238 --> 33:51.238
See you, pal.

33:54.309 --> 33:56.043
There you go.

33:56.111 --> 33:57.544
He's right, you know.

33:57.613 --> 33:59.846
Something is bugging you.

33:59.915 --> 34:02.082
Oh, you heard that?

34:02.151 --> 34:04.851
And I think I got
a pretty good idea what it is.

34:04.920 --> 34:07.754
You love the results,
uh, just not too keen

34:07.823 --> 34:09.356
on how we got there.

34:09.425 --> 34:12.192
I'm just not so
sure that I can

34:12.261 --> 34:15.062
do this job if
I have to lie

34:15.130 --> 34:16.730
every time to
get the job done.

34:16.799 --> 34:18.197
So don't.

34:18.266 --> 34:20.199
- But you said...
- That's me.

34:20.268 --> 34:21.467
I mean, that's my way.

34:21.536 --> 34:23.937
Keep in mind, I've been
doing this a long time.

34:24.005 --> 34:25.172
I'm old school.

34:25.239 --> 34:26.672
I-I found a tool

34:26.742 --> 34:28.275
that works for me,
so I use it.

34:28.342 --> 34:30.043
But it really works.

34:30.112 --> 34:31.945
It sure does,
but that doesn't mean

34:32.014 --> 34:34.014
it's the only thing that works.

34:34.083 --> 34:36.650
You're young, learn
from everyone. Be a sponge.

34:36.717 --> 34:38.452
I'm no Dick Tracy.

34:38.520 --> 34:41.420
I'm one guy with one tool.

34:41.489 --> 34:43.857
You've got plenty of room
for lots of tools

34:43.926 --> 34:46.059
on your tool belt.

34:46.128 --> 34:48.061
<b><font color="#FF5500">(sighs)</font></b>

34:51.100 --> 34:53.766
Well, thanks.

34:53.835 --> 34:55.469
Thanks, Anthony.

35:23.632 --> 35:26.099
Have a seat.

35:26.168 --> 35:27.701
Not that one.

35:27.769 --> 35:29.302
That one.

35:42.184 --> 35:44.451
You're a smart guy,
one of our best and brightest.

35:44.520 --> 35:47.254
Maybe someday you'll end up
in that chair.

35:47.322 --> 35:48.655
How's it feel?

35:51.293 --> 35:52.559
It's uncomfortable.

35:54.496 --> 35:57.130
Sounds about right.

35:57.199 --> 35:59.366
I got this, uh...

35:59.434 --> 36:02.169
bear of an issue
I'm wrestling with,

36:02.237 --> 36:05.205
one I can't find
a resolution to.

36:05.274 --> 36:09.009
So, you're the
commissioner now.

36:09.077 --> 36:10.877
Tell me what
you would do.

36:10.946 --> 36:12.979
Do with what, sir?

36:14.716 --> 36:16.850
Well, there's a file
in front of you.

36:16.919 --> 36:19.819
The name and the photos
have been blacked out

36:19.888 --> 36:22.589
to protect this individual
but somehow,

36:22.658 --> 36:24.925
I think you'll get the gist.

36:38.307 --> 36:40.240
<b><font color="#FF5500">(exhales)</font></b>

36:43.545 --> 36:46.680
What that file doesn't say

36:46.748 --> 36:49.316
is this stickup kid

36:49.384 --> 36:51.885
goes on to turn his life around

36:51.954 --> 36:54.387
and pursue his dream

36:54.456 --> 36:57.791
of becoming
a decorated NYPD cop.

36:58.894 --> 37:00.393
If I may explain, sir...

37:00.462 --> 37:03.563
You're the commissioner now,
you don't have to explain.

37:03.632 --> 37:06.600
You have to decide...

37:06.668 --> 37:08.435
what's going to happen to him.

37:08.503 --> 37:09.736
I don't know.

37:09.805 --> 37:12.172
Not an option.
Not from where you sit.

37:12.241 --> 37:13.707
But I don't know, sir.

37:13.775 --> 37:16.076
You can't plead the Fifth,
you can't pass the buck,

37:16.144 --> 37:17.844
you can't buy a vowel.

37:17.913 --> 37:19.846
Should he stay or should he go?

37:22.517 --> 37:24.451
<b><font color="#FF5500">(exhales)</font></b>

37:24.519 --> 37:26.253
He should go.

37:31.593 --> 37:33.526
Why?

37:36.431 --> 37:38.698
Because the NYPD
doesn't hire felons.

37:40.802 --> 37:43.536
On top of that,
he lied to get the job.

37:43.605 --> 37:47.173
And he maintained that lie
for 20 years.

37:48.543 --> 37:51.645
What about the fact
that for those 20 years,

37:51.713 --> 37:53.713
he served as the gold standard

37:53.782 --> 37:56.349
for what an NYPD cop should be?

37:57.886 --> 37:59.219
Doesn't matter.

38:02.291 --> 38:04.457
He's a felon.

38:04.526 --> 38:06.860
He's got to go.

38:08.964 --> 38:10.897
<b><font color="#FF5500">(exhales)</font></b>

38:15.737 --> 38:18.204
You know...

38:18.273 --> 38:21.007
I don't think you'd make a good
commissioner after all.

38:22.978 --> 38:24.911
But a cop like that...

38:26.815 --> 38:28.381
I'm keeping him.

how to thank you enough.

<b><font color="#FF0080">ERIN:</font></b>
For what?

39:07.789 --> 39:09.055
Our bet.

39:10.192 --> 39:11.224
You said he'd call me.

39:11.293 --> 39:13.393
Call you about what?

39:13.462 --> 39:15.095
See there?
Pay up.

39:15.163 --> 39:16.830
You didn't call him
after the shooting

39:16.898 --> 39:19.566
at the gas station?
- Was I supposed to?

39:19.634 --> 39:21.868
- That was my job.
- Mm-hmm.

39:21.937 --> 39:24.070
- How is it your job?
- As the patriarch.

39:25.507 --> 39:26.806
But as his father?

39:26.875 --> 39:28.975
Someday you'll see.

39:29.044 --> 39:32.011
- See what?
- Well, more like see when.

39:32.080 --> 39:35.248
When to back off trying
to suss out your kid's problems.

39:35.317 --> 39:37.984
That first time that you...

39:38.053 --> 39:40.887
go to knock on
the closed bedroom door

39:40.956 --> 39:43.256
and something tells you "don't."

39:43.325 --> 39:45.825
Like, let them
handle it themselves?

39:45.894 --> 39:47.660
Yeah, when it's time.

39:47.729 --> 39:49.295
Well, when did you know
with Mom?

39:49.364 --> 39:52.265
When she was 18 and threatened
me with a restraining order.

39:52.334 --> 39:54.000
<b><font color="#FF5500">(scoffs)</font></b> I did not.
<b><font color="#FF5500">(laughter)</font></b>

39:54.069 --> 39:55.268
Practically.

39:55.337 --> 39:57.704
Anyway, that was
your mom's duty.

39:57.773 --> 39:58.938
What about Jameson?

39:59.007 --> 40:02.542
Jameson? Jameson.
<b><font color="#FF5500">(laughter)</font></b>

40:02.611 --> 40:05.478
- He was always cool, he...
- Hmm.

40:05.547 --> 40:07.380
like he
instinctively knew

40:07.449 --> 40:09.783
that the more advice
you harvest,

40:09.851 --> 40:12.152
the better the odds are
to make the right move.

40:12.220 --> 40:15.488
Now, I always felt
the knock was welcomed.

40:15.557 --> 40:16.723
And last but not least?

40:16.792 --> 40:18.792
- Uh, best for last.
- Sure.

40:18.860 --> 40:20.326
Oh, that's easy.

40:20.395 --> 40:22.629
When your dad
was eight years old,

40:22.697 --> 40:24.030
he got suspended
from school

40:24.099 --> 40:25.698
for... guess what.

40:25.767 --> 40:28.201
<b><font color="#FF0080">ALL:</font></b>
Fighting.

40:28.270 --> 40:31.237
So I go to his room,
I sit him down

40:31.306 --> 40:33.173
and I ask him what happened.

40:33.241 --> 40:35.508
And he just gives me
the bare bones.

40:35.577 --> 40:38.111
So I said directly,
"What did that kid say

40:38.180 --> 40:41.347
or do to make you
throw the first punch?"

40:41.416 --> 40:43.483

40:43.552 --> 40:45.452
"Trust me, you don't want
to freaking know."

40:45.520 --> 40:47.821

40:47.889 --> 40:50.001
