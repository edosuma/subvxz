00:01.040 --> 00:05.440
In the world today, protecting
a country's borders is vital.

00:06.960 --> 00:08.920
It is seen as a
gateway to the UK.

00:08.960 --> 00:12.280
These are the men and
women in uniform responsible for

00:12.320 --> 00:14.480
safeguarding Ireland's borders.

00:14.520 --> 00:16.280
Stopping... Look at me.

00:16.320 --> 00:17.920
Behind the yellow
line. ..Searching...

00:17.960 --> 00:19.576
Have you been stopped
at a checkpoint before?

00:19.600 --> 00:21.496
Will you just listen to me?
Will you just listen to me?

00:21.520 --> 00:25.000
..And seizing drugs,
arms and illegal goods.

00:25.040 --> 00:27.960
If anyone tries to harm me,
that dog will tear them to shreds.

00:28.000 --> 00:29.720
Saving lives...

00:29.760 --> 00:32.920
I'd say about 200km per
hour. ..And protecting Ireland's

00:32.960 --> 00:36.040
inhabitants and millions
of visiting tourists.

00:36.080 --> 00:38.256
You could have been here
100 times, it doesn't mean that

00:38.280 --> 00:40.600
you're guaranteed to
get in the 101st time.

00:40.640 --> 00:42.960
They police the ports...

00:43.000 --> 00:44.640
Well, you have to make sure

00:44.680 --> 00:46.840
there's definitely nobody
underneath the vehicle.

00:46.880 --> 00:48.440
..The airports...

00:48.480 --> 00:50.120
Why did you tell me
you weren't working?

00:50.160 --> 00:53.200
..And the roads. These are
very badly damaged straps.

00:53.240 --> 00:56.040
If you can't drive the truck,
shouldn't be on the road.

00:58.200 --> 01:00.200
These are the...

01:10.240 --> 01:13.920
The garda traffic corps are in
hot pursuit of a stolen vehicle.

01:17.640 --> 01:19.560
Illegal immigrants
make a run for it.

01:19.600 --> 01:23.120
Can cork security catch them
before they cross the border?

01:25.920 --> 01:28.760
And at cork airport,
there's an Interpol alert.

01:28.800 --> 01:31.960
System Interpol, a hit.

01:38.360 --> 01:42.080
Over 2.3 million passengers pass
through the doors of cork airport

01:42.120 --> 01:46.240
every year, and every single
one of them must pass through

01:46.280 --> 01:48.280
passport and immigration.

01:49.280 --> 01:53.800
On the desk today are officers
Noel Maxwell and James ahern.

01:53.840 --> 01:58.040
Their job is to spot anyone
acting suspiciously or trying

01:58.080 --> 02:00.320
to enter the country illegally.

02:00.360 --> 02:02.680
Do you have a travel document?

02:02.720 --> 02:08.000
Border control entails the vetting
of eu persons and non-eu persons,

02:08.040 --> 02:10.016
see that they're suitable
for entering the state.

02:10.040 --> 02:12.040
Are you living in Ireland?

02:12.080 --> 02:14.560
Hello. How are you?
This is border control

02:14.600 --> 02:16.960
so, by arriving here, they are

02:17.000 --> 02:20.960
scrutinised as it could be their
first point of entry into the eu.

02:21.000 --> 02:26.200
In 2017, nearly 0.5 million people
were denied entry to eu countries

02:26.240 --> 02:28.600
by border guards.

02:28.640 --> 02:31.240
We are high up in there
in the human rights stakes.

02:31.280 --> 02:33.080
It is seen as a
gateway to the UK.

02:33.120 --> 02:37.800
We have an economy that is
back on track after a recession

02:37.840 --> 02:42.240
and working and living conditions
here are of quite a high standard.

02:42.280 --> 02:44.280
How are you doing? I
suppose the main thing

02:44.320 --> 02:49.920
with border control policing
is experience. Off the phone.

02:49.960 --> 02:53.520
Take your card. Stand
behind the yellow line.

02:53.560 --> 02:55.520
Excuse me? Hello. Look at me.

02:55.560 --> 02:57.840
Behind the yellow
line. Alright, very good.

02:57.880 --> 03:00.680
You are watching, you are
listening and you're carefully

03:00.720 --> 03:03.800
scrutinising people as they are
coming towards you in the lines

03:03.840 --> 03:06.680
and the queues, and then you're
following that up with questions

03:06.720 --> 03:09.000
and scanning of documentation.

03:09.040 --> 03:10.560
At an international airport

03:10.600 --> 03:14.800
like cork, immigration officers must
face people from all over the world.

03:15.800 --> 03:18.200
Why did you tell me
you weren't working?

03:18.240 --> 03:20.840
Because I-I don't... don't
understand your question.

03:20.880 --> 03:26.000
There are occasions where
people may want to use

03:26.040 --> 03:28.840
the fact that they are
not fluent in English.

03:28.880 --> 03:31.200
That creates a problem.

03:31.240 --> 03:35.240
A woman has just flown in from
Spain and is at officer Maxwell's desk

03:35.280 --> 03:38.240
and there's a problem
with her eu identity card.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.880
The card has had a hit
on the Interpol database.

03:47.360 --> 03:51.120
30 million travel documents
are reported lost or stolen

03:51.160 --> 03:52.840
across Europe every year.

03:52.880 --> 03:55.160
Counterfeit and stolen
documents are a key factor

03:55.200 --> 03:59.240
in international terrorism, with
criminals paying up to 10,000 Euros

03:59.280 --> 04:01.680
for them on the black market.

04:01.720 --> 04:04.320
Back at cork airport, with

04:04.360 --> 04:07.240
the woman's limited English,
it's tough going for officer Maxwell.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.400
Good job his colleague,
James ahern, speaks Spanish.

04:40.560 --> 04:43.040
Yeah, she said
she lost the first.

04:43.080 --> 04:46.120
According to her, she
reported her ID card stolen

04:46.160 --> 04:48.440
but has since found it.

04:48.480 --> 04:52.760
She says she thought she
could still use it for travel.

04:52.800 --> 04:55.080
As her card's been flagged by

04:55.120 --> 04:58.920
Interpol, the guards need to make
sure she is who she says she is.

04:58.960 --> 05:01.160
All the woman
can do now is wait.

05:08.400 --> 05:10.880
Car crime in Ireland
is big business.

05:10.920 --> 05:13.920
Using the busy seaport at Dublin,
criminals are able to steal cars

05:13.960 --> 05:17.840
to order and have them out of
the country in a matter of hours.

05:19.680 --> 05:22.680
Operation waste was set up
to combat the gangs involved.

05:24.520 --> 05:26.560
Since 2015, it's estimated that

05:26.600 --> 05:30.280
over 3 million Euros worth of
stolen cars have been recovered.

05:32.520 --> 05:34.000
Garda traffic
officers Damian Duffy

05:34.040 --> 05:36.960
and John Caitlin are
working to patrol and secure

05:37.000 --> 05:40.600
the Irish borders in the
never-ending fight against crime.

05:40.640 --> 05:43.280
We have a great emphasis
on policing the port for

05:43.320 --> 05:45.040
a number of reasons.

05:45.080 --> 05:47.480
It's a point of entry
and exit into the state.

05:47.520 --> 05:49.696
We have to keep our eye on people
and goods coming and going that

05:49.720 --> 05:54.240
shouldn't be. There's
awful lot of very high-spec,

05:54.280 --> 05:56.640
very high-value
cars being taken.

05:56.680 --> 06:00.640
Very often, the keys will have
been fished outside of the letterbox.

06:00.680 --> 06:04.400
That could happen in the early
hours of the morning and by 6am,

06:04.440 --> 06:08.040
those cars are in containers,
they're on boats, they're on

06:08.080 --> 06:10.480
ships and they're leaving
the country for destinations

06:10.520 --> 06:14.080
in Africa and Eastern Europe.

06:14.120 --> 06:17.800
It's not long before a
call comes over the radio.

06:24.760 --> 06:27.360
It's exactly the type of
vehicle that is smuggled

06:27.400 --> 06:29.480
across the border overnight.

06:29.520 --> 06:31.360
They head to intercept.

06:37.920 --> 06:41.000
Too many cars. It's too
dangerous for the stinger.

06:41.040 --> 06:44.640
No, we've been told not to
use it because it's a motorway.

06:44.680 --> 06:47.440
It's too many live lanes
of traffic, it's not safe.

06:47.480 --> 06:49.680
I'd say reverse trap because...

06:49.720 --> 06:52.520
So the officers lie in
wait for the stolen car.

06:57.960 --> 07:00.240
Here he comes now. Full speed.

07:02.120 --> 07:04.640
Oh, lovely Audi.

07:04.680 --> 07:06.360
Oh, the rs!

07:07.920 --> 07:10.320
I'd say about 200km per hour.

07:10.360 --> 07:14.440
The stolen Audi disappears fast
into the distance. There's no way these

07:14.480 --> 07:17.800
boys in their standard-issue
patrol car are going to keep up.

07:17.840 --> 07:20.760
My god. That's some
speed, isn't it, guys?

07:20.800 --> 07:22.560
It's absolutely scary.

07:22.600 --> 07:25.320
Luckily, several colleagues
in more high-powered vehicles

07:25.360 --> 07:27.080
are already hot on its tail.

07:32.720 --> 07:35.640
Officers Duffy and
Caitlin follow close behind,

07:35.680 --> 07:37.680
ready to offer backup
at any moment.

07:46.280 --> 07:48.280
Amazing. That
is a brilliant result.

07:49.480 --> 07:51.200
The vehicle that
was being pursued

07:51.240 --> 07:54.560
all the way from laois has just
been brought to a conclusion.

07:54.600 --> 07:56.360
The driver has been
arrested now, as well.

07:56.400 --> 07:59.360
It turns out that the vehicle in
question had been stolen with keys

07:59.400 --> 08:00.960
from a house in the Midlands.

08:01.000 --> 08:04.120
It's a Audi a6. Nice car now.

08:04.160 --> 08:05.960
Half of it in the wall.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.720
He was going - god only
knows what speed he was doing -

08:09.760 --> 08:12.960
way above the capacity of
most of the patrol cars in our fleet.

08:13.000 --> 08:16.040
The risks are massive.
They're absolutely massive.

08:16.080 --> 08:18.960
See the two cars here, either
side of the marked patrol car

08:19.000 --> 08:20.640
and the roundabout?

08:20.680 --> 08:24.760
They're the cream of the crop,
high-performance pursuit vehicles.

08:24.800 --> 08:28.080
If it wasn't for them two,
there'd be no conclusion tonight.

08:28.120 --> 08:33.000
So, we have the vehicle
that was stolen, recovered,

08:34.160 --> 08:37.640
minor damage, and we
have one prisoner in custody.

08:37.680 --> 08:42.280
And, most importantly, nobody
was hurt, so it was a good result.

08:42.320 --> 08:45.440
If it wasn't for the garda
traffic corps, the stolen Audi

08:45.480 --> 08:48.640
would have been across the border
and out of the country by morning.

08:51.400 --> 08:53.800
Dublin port covers
over 600 acres

08:53.840 --> 08:57.200
and handles over 100,000
haulage vehicles a year,

08:57.240 --> 08:59.840
making protecting
it no mean feat.

09:01.680 --> 09:05.360
Activity at the port never stops
and the site is monitored 24 hours

09:05.400 --> 09:09.440
a day, seven days a week,
by a network of cctv cameras.

09:11.520 --> 09:14.080
In the control room,
security officers

09:14.120 --> 09:19.080
dermot weldon and paddy Rooney
are viewing live feeds from the system.

09:19.120 --> 09:21.440
Over there. The
lad walking there.

09:21.480 --> 09:23.640
Control to Alpha 3.
They are on the frontline

09:23.680 --> 09:27.120
in the battle against illegal
immigrants who stop at nothing to

09:27.160 --> 09:29.720
try and make it
across the border.

09:31.760 --> 09:33.760
And tonight is no exception.

09:35.480 --> 09:39.080
Having emerged from under a
newly arrived truck, these people

09:39.120 --> 09:40.960
may believe they
are home and dry

09:41.000 --> 09:44.440
but their every move is
now under surveillance.

09:44.480 --> 09:46.040
There's nowhere to run.

09:47.680 --> 09:53.400
In 2017, more than ten people every
24 hours were stopped, refused entry

09:53.440 --> 09:55.480
and deported out of the country.

09:57.040 --> 10:00.360
Coordinating a ground team
into position, port security

10:00.400 --> 10:02.800
and the garda are ready
and waiting to spring their trap.

10:05.240 --> 10:09.000
After a long and dangerous journey,
their attempt to enter the country

10:09.040 --> 10:10.840
has ended in capture.

10:10.880 --> 10:13.000
Tonight, this border is secure.

10:16.760 --> 10:21.800
Back at cork airport, a Spanish
passenger is stuck airside.

10:21.840 --> 10:24.920
She's travelling on an ID card
that's been flagged by Interpol

10:24.960 --> 10:26.960
as stolen.

10:39.480 --> 10:42.560
Finally, she's able to produce
a Spanish driving licence.

10:44.720 --> 10:47.920
Now the guards must decide if
the woman is who she says she is.

10:51.960 --> 10:55.120
It's entirely down to officer
Maxwell to decide if the woman

10:55.160 --> 10:57.160
should be allowed
to enter Ireland.

11:00.480 --> 11:01.960
Ok.

11:03.720 --> 11:06.080
He reviews her
paperwork and is satisfied.

11:07.440 --> 11:10.200
The woman is permitted
to enter the country.

11:10.240 --> 11:13.120
Ok, this is your
driver's licence.

11:13.160 --> 11:17.160
This is a letter explaining
- I don't know your English.

11:17.200 --> 11:19.200
Your English college
will have to explain.

11:19.240 --> 11:21.240
(Speaks Spanish)

11:27.800 --> 11:31.200
I must keep this,
ok? Because of this.

11:33.120 --> 11:35.040
Gracias.

11:40.320 --> 11:43.320
She said that
she'd lost her card

11:43.360 --> 11:47.520
and obviously had reported it
lost or stolen and then had found it

11:47.560 --> 11:51.560
again was reusing it so it
comes up as a hit on the system.

11:51.600 --> 11:54.000
So we're obliged
then to act on that.

11:54.040 --> 11:57.840
She had her Spanish
driver's licence with her,

11:57.880 --> 12:02.040
so I was happy with her identity
and that, and she's here for

12:02.080 --> 12:05.880
a specific reason in the country,
so she'll have to go to our embassy

12:05.920 --> 12:08.200
and get a new travel
document issued.

12:11.720 --> 12:16.320
There are approximately 350,000
goods vehicles on the road in Ireland,

12:16.360 --> 12:19.760
travelling between the borders
and from coastal ports to airports.

12:23.120 --> 12:26.160
It's the job of the road safety
authority working with the police

12:26.200 --> 12:30.560
to enforce the rules that keep
vehicles safe on Irish roads.

12:30.600 --> 12:32.416
Brake pad indicator
light is on its way, like.

12:32.440 --> 12:34.480
Ok. (Indistinct) Yeah.

12:37.040 --> 12:42.640
Today, garda officer Liam lawler is
part of an rsa checkpoint in carlow.

12:47.680 --> 12:50.560
Officer lawler has pulled over a
truck and is immediately concerned

12:50.600 --> 12:52.920
by what he sees.

12:52.960 --> 12:55.080
The truck is fully
loaded at the moment.

12:55.120 --> 12:57.840
Here at the back,
there's kegs, they're full.

12:57.880 --> 13:01.160
Quite heavy, actually. And
there are other products on top

13:01.200 --> 13:05.800
of products here on the pallets,
so you have a pallet of goods then

13:05.840 --> 13:08.136
you have other pallets and
other pallets on top of that again,

13:08.160 --> 13:09.880
so you have an unstable load.

13:09.920 --> 13:11.640
There's nothing
holding this load here.

13:11.680 --> 13:16.240
The curtains are purely to keep
the weather away from the product.

13:16.280 --> 13:18.640
This could be very dangerous if

13:18.680 --> 13:23.920
the load was to shift on a bend or
on a roundabout or a sudden stop.

13:23.960 --> 13:26.560
It wouldn't be

13:26.600 --> 13:30.960
right to let him continue
knowing that it is not a safe load.

13:31.000 --> 13:35.120
Officer lawler calls the truck
owner to voice his concerns.

13:35.160 --> 13:37.640
When we opened the curtains
on this, there are no gates or

13:37.680 --> 13:39.880
any form of load
securing on it at all.

13:39.920 --> 13:43.360
I'm a little bit disappointed
that it's like this because,

13:43.400 --> 13:45.000
you know, anything could

13:45.040 --> 13:47.296
come through the curtains, they're
purely a weather curtain, you know.

13:47.320 --> 13:49.480
We can't let him continue with

13:49.520 --> 13:51.280
the truck the way
it is at the moment.

13:51.320 --> 13:56.160
Driving with an unsecured load could
mean three penalty points and a fine

13:56.200 --> 13:58.200
of up to 5,000
Euros for the driver.

13:59.920 --> 14:02.360
Officer lawler tells
them that unless they can

14:02.400 --> 14:05.080
rectify the situation, the
truck is going nowhere.

14:06.840 --> 14:11.080
It's not long before a
Van arrives carrying

14:11.120 --> 14:13.560
a set of gates
for the beer truck.

14:13.600 --> 14:15.680
Officer lawler supervises
as they are fitted.

14:15.720 --> 14:18.840
And I can tell you now...

14:18.880 --> 14:21.000
Why these were not put on before

14:21.040 --> 14:23.840
the truck left its depot
is anyone's guess.

14:23.880 --> 14:26.440
These are the gates that already,
obviously, have been made.

14:26.480 --> 14:30.200
They weren't made in the last
hour since we stopped the truck,

14:31.080 --> 14:35.640
so they obviously have been made
already and just haven't been put.

14:35.680 --> 14:38.120
This changes this
load completely.

14:38.160 --> 14:42.240
Obviously, with these
cages, nothing can break free.

14:44.160 --> 14:48.000
This time, the driver is sent
on his way with just a warning

14:48.040 --> 14:51.560
and a potentially lethal
situation has been averted.

14:53.280 --> 14:58.880
He had kegs of beer, he had crates
of beer and, for one of those kegs

14:58.920 --> 15:01.840
to come off and to hit or
to damage or to go through

15:01.880 --> 15:04.600
the windscreen of a car, could
have catastrophic effects, really.

15:06.680 --> 15:08.640
Car and commercial
vehicle smuggling

15:08.680 --> 15:11.120
is a major organised
crime within Ireland.

15:11.160 --> 15:13.640
Knocked-off vehicles are
traded on the black market

15:13.680 --> 15:17.760
with cars either used for crime
or specific models stolen to order.

15:17.800 --> 15:20.600
There's an awful
lot of very high-spec,

15:20.640 --> 15:22.840
very high-value
cars being taken.

15:22.880 --> 15:26.720
That could happen in the early
hours of the morning and by 6am,

15:26.760 --> 15:28.680
those cars are in containers,

15:28.720 --> 15:30.896
they're on boats, they're
on ships and they're leaving

15:30.920 --> 15:35.000
the country for destinations
in Africa and Eastern Europe.

15:35.040 --> 15:39.440
Dublin port handles around
400,000 shipping containers

15:39.480 --> 15:41.120
and trailers each year.

15:41.160 --> 15:44.360
Brand-new vehicles are
shipped in and out of the port daily

15:44.400 --> 15:49.080
and it's while they're stored
on site that opportunists strike.

15:49.120 --> 15:51.920
But getting the vehicles
out of the country requires

15:51.960 --> 15:53.800
getting them past port security.

15:56.640 --> 16:00.120
On ground patrol, security
officer dermot weldon is called to

16:00.160 --> 16:03.840
the port's secure truck compound,
where new vehicles stored

16:03.880 --> 16:06.320
are waiting collection.

16:06.360 --> 16:10.880
A man has handed over paperwork
claiming it allows him to take

16:10.920 --> 16:13.760
a truck, but dermot
is not convinced

16:13.800 --> 16:16.800
and has called in colleague
paddy Rooney to take a look.

16:18.840 --> 16:21.040
Go and take a
look at that, uh...

16:21.080 --> 16:24.840
They decide they need to
question the man further.

16:24.880 --> 16:28.000
Now, it should have went
there in the first place.

16:28.040 --> 16:31.480
With nothing to prove that the
truck should be released to him,

16:31.520 --> 16:34.440
the officers need to work
out if this is another case

16:34.480 --> 16:37.200
of vehicle theft. This
gentleman has a small,

16:37.240 --> 16:39.920
little docket but the problem that
we have here at the moment is,

16:39.960 --> 16:45.120
he could've collected that
docket inside for the load,

16:45.160 --> 16:48.400
then came over here hoping to
get a 90,000 euro truck outta here.

16:48.440 --> 16:52.240
Making the wrong decision
will allow the driver to take

16:52.280 --> 16:55.320
90,000 Euros worth of truck
out from under their noses.

16:58.880 --> 17:01.600
He's not collecting an old unit,
e's getting a brand-new cab,

17:01.640 --> 17:03.840
90,000 worth.

17:03.880 --> 17:06.640
So come along on Monday
morning, man comes down

17:06.680 --> 17:08.240
looking for his
cab and it's gone.

17:09.840 --> 17:12.800
The man still insists he's
supposed to be picking up the truck.

17:12.840 --> 17:16.080
The gentleman has a
parcel that he used for...

17:16.120 --> 17:18.840
Paddy radios through to
the security office to see

17:18.880 --> 17:21.600
if there's anything that might
prove the truck can be released.

17:21.640 --> 17:25.280
But without the paperwork,
it's bad news for the guy.

17:25.320 --> 17:28.320
No, it's not going
out. It's a new truck.

17:28.360 --> 17:32.560
Paddy and dermot have stuck to
their guns. This truck is going nowhere.

17:36.400 --> 17:38.440
Dublin's busy port is located

17:38.480 --> 17:42.040
20 minutes' drive away
from its international airport.

17:42.080 --> 17:45.240
These two key destinations
require frequent freight

17:45.280 --> 17:47.280
deliveries transported
between them.

17:48.920 --> 17:51.680
Hgvs now use Dublin port tunnel.

17:51.720 --> 17:56.800
At 4.5 km long, it easily
connects the two locations,

17:56.840 --> 18:01.040
avoiding the city centre and
shaving time off their journeys.

18:01.080 --> 18:06.160
The trucks are picking up jet
fuel from ships docking at the port

18:06.200 --> 18:09.800
and transporting it to the
airport to refuel planes.

18:11.520 --> 18:15.120
Carrying highly explosive loads
through underground tunnels

18:15.160 --> 18:18.480
requires skilled drivers to
drive extremely carefully,

18:18.520 --> 18:20.520
as tunnel fires can
be catastrophic.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.600
Patrolling in and
around the tunnel

18:25.640 --> 18:29.040
today are garda traffic officers
are Philip Earl and paddy mcilroy.

18:31.320 --> 18:34.200
Travelling in an unmarked
car has its advantages.

18:34.240 --> 18:36.240
(Truck horn blaring)

18:44.360 --> 18:47.080
What they're witnessing
now is a cause for major alarm.

18:48.360 --> 18:51.480
Heading for the airport, this
driver appears to be in a hurry.

18:57.080 --> 18:59.760
Trucks travelling over
80km per hour require

18:59.800 --> 19:01.800
at least 100m to stop safely.

19:07.560 --> 19:11.320
Speeding in a confined space
and carrying explosive material,

19:11.360 --> 19:13.360
there's only one
guaranteed response.

19:14.760 --> 19:16.760
(Sirens blare)

19:23.880 --> 19:26.520
This driver has been
caught fair and square

19:26.560 --> 19:29.680
and by the one cop
he doesn't want to meet.

19:29.720 --> 19:32.360
That's some disgraceful driving.

19:32.400 --> 19:35.200
I'll introduce myself. My
name's garda Philip Earl.

19:35.240 --> 19:37.936
I'm attached to region traffic base
at Dublin castle on the commercial

19:37.960 --> 19:41.920
vehicle unit so, in other words,
the man who does the trucks.

19:41.960 --> 19:44.920
So we can stop all
that carry-on now.

19:44.960 --> 19:47.200
If you can't drive the truck,
shouldn't be on the road.

19:48.880 --> 19:52.160
Well, that's not what I'm
after seeing back there.

19:52.200 --> 19:55.880
I'm after seeing you within 10ft
of a vehicle, flashing your lights.

19:55.920 --> 19:58.800
Are you aware what happens
when you crash one of those

19:58.840 --> 20:01.120
in a tunnel? Very much so.

20:01.160 --> 20:02.840
And that's the way we drive?

20:06.160 --> 20:08.240
So you're telling me you
can't control the vehicle?

20:09.240 --> 20:12.200
Well, it didn't look like it. This
is the excuse you're telling me.

20:12.240 --> 20:14.840
We could have been an
old lady driving in front of him

20:14.880 --> 20:17.800
or a vulnerable road user,
but they can panic in that sort of

20:17.840 --> 20:20.560
situation, where they see a
large truck coming up behind them.

20:20.600 --> 20:23.200
They can either change lanes,

20:23.240 --> 20:26.000
cause another vehicle
to brake unnecessarily,

20:26.040 --> 20:31.880
or there's any sort of different
scenarios that can unfold as part

20:31.920 --> 20:33.920
of an aggressive
driver like this.

20:34.640 --> 20:39.320
He's basically saying that he
couldn't slow down the truck enough.

20:44.440 --> 20:46.800
I mean, it's incredible
stuff to be saying.

20:46.840 --> 20:49.280
A professional driver
and all the driving licences.

20:49.320 --> 20:52.520
He's carrying fuel destined for
Dublin airport and he's driving

20:52.560 --> 20:57.360
in that manner. Exasperated
by his explanation,

20:57.400 --> 21:00.760
it's within the cops' power to
take the vehicle off the road.

21:00.800 --> 21:02.840
I'm going to give
you a ticket for driving

21:02.880 --> 21:05.256
without due care and attention.
It is penalty points and it is a fine.

21:05.280 --> 21:06.920
If that was some
poor tourist there,

21:06.960 --> 21:08.496
thinking, "there's
something wrong with my car.

21:08.520 --> 21:10.800
I better stop. This man
wants to talk to me,"

21:10.840 --> 21:14.280
we'd be looking at ambulances
now, if we were lucky.

21:14.320 --> 21:16.320
I'll leave you to
it, sir. Take care.

21:18.520 --> 21:22.880
He's got off lightly, but
there's a final sting in the tail.

21:22.920 --> 21:25.000
He's a registered
driving instructor.

21:25.040 --> 21:27.040
You couldn't make that up.

21:28.160 --> 21:32.160
The officers can take comfort that a
potential disaster has been averted.
