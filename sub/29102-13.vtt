04:14.712 --> 04:16.047
breakfast for dinner...

04:18.841 --> 04:20.051
for breakfast.

04:35.608 --> 04:39.070
I didn't know what to do.
She's been like that all night.

04:39.570 --> 04:41.281
I didn't want to leave her alone.

04:42.573 --> 04:44.659
I'll handle it from here. Thank you.

04:45.535 --> 04:46.744
Um...

04:46.828 --> 04:48.871
Could you please let the other COs know

04:48.955 --> 04:52.583
I expect to see them
in the multi

04:52.667 --> 04:53.710
Everyone.

04:54.127 --> 04:55.753
-Sure.
-Thank you.

05:00.258 --> 05:01.426
Hey, Taystee.

05:03.886 --> 05:06.222
I'm sorry about your friend.

05:06.681 --> 05:08.141
She wasn't my friend.

05:09.017 --> 05:10.435
She was my student.

05:11.519 --> 05:12.562
Okay.

05:15.690 --> 05:16.649
Um...

05:18.526 --> 05:19.819
What happened?

05:20.236 --> 05:21.696
I don't know what happened.

05:22.739 --> 05:24.949
I only saw her after it happened.

05:32.790 --> 05:34.917
You okay?

05:36.669 --> 05:38.880
I seen too many dead bodies, man.

05:42.633 --> 05:44.886
How many dead bodies
would you say you seen?

05:44.969 --> 05:47.972
-I don't fuckin' know.

05:51.142 --> 05:52.226
I seen six.

05:53.394 --> 05:54.645
Before I got this job.

05:56.314 --> 05:57.815
Two or three, I seen with you.

06:00.026 --> 06:02.153
You remember when that car jumped the curb

06:02.570 --> 06:05.406
and mowed down Antwan Stokes

06:05.490 --> 06:09.243
-Yeah, I remember.

06:11.746 --> 06:14.082
And I saw that girl get shot
outside Duane Reade.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.879
Yeah, I think that was
Marquis Taylor's cousin.

06:19.962 --> 06:21.881
-Yeah.
-She was, like, 12.

06:25.343 --> 06:27.220
And some fool
jumped in front of the train,

06:27.303 --> 06:28.930
but that's not like really seeing a body.

06:29.013 --> 06:31.974
That's like blood and meat.

06:35.019 --> 06:37.730
-And my dog died.

06:39.232 --> 06:43.277
That was four years ago.

06:45.363 --> 06:47.698
But it was time.

06:48.199 --> 06:51.869
His hair was all white.
Couldn't see. He was walking into walls.

06:53.454 --> 06:56.040
Your dead dog pissed in my backpack.

06:56.124 --> 06:59.127
He soaked that thing.

06:59.210 --> 07:01.879
And you know they wasn't giving me
a new one at the group home,

07:01.963 --> 07:07.260
so I had to walk around all year
with my books in a piss pack.

07:08.511 --> 07:10.721
Fucking monkey dog.

07:10.805 --> 07:13.766
-Man, I'm glad that dog's dead.

07:16.644 --> 07:18.104
You know, my mom was talkin' about

07:18.187 --> 07:20.857
stuffing him and keeping him
in the living room.

07:22.358 --> 07:26.362
Thank God we couldn't afford it.
It was creepy as fuck.

07:32.118 --> 07:35.037
You think she did it on purpose?
Your friend?

07:37.331 --> 07:40.293
-She wasn't my friend.
I'm sorry.

07:44.255 --> 07:45.381
I don't know. Probably.

07:51.137 --> 07:52.221
Maybe.

07:54.640 --> 07:56.350
She was in a bad way.

07:57.768 --> 07:58.936
And I get it. You get it?

08:04.192 --> 08:06.444
Tamika, I don't think
I can do this no more.

08:07.487 --> 08:10.072
No, I know you think that,
but that don't make it true.

08:10.406 --> 08:11.949
Okay, how about this?

08:12.867 --> 08:14.869
I don't wanna do this no more.

08:18.915 --> 08:20.291
Tomorrow will be better.

08:23.336 --> 08:26.589
That's what my mom used to say to me
after a bad day.

08:27.006 --> 08:31.093
Yeah, well, tomorrow can also be worse.
That's been my fuckin' experience.

08:31.761 --> 08:35.014
And your mom wanted to stuff
a dead dog, so...

08:38.809 --> 08:40.811
So she's an optimist.

08:43.564 --> 08:48.569
I know someone in this room is responsible
for drugs coming in, for phones coming in.

08:49.153 --> 08:51.447
Inmates left unsupervised.

08:52.198 --> 08:54.325
We will deal with all of this,

08:54.408 --> 08:57.787
but right now, you are going to do
a drug sweep so thorough

08:57.870 --> 09:00.331
that when PolyCon comes
to rip me a new one,

09:00.414 --> 09:02.917
she will have to wade through
a giant pile of contraband

09:03.000 --> 09:04.710
to even get near me.

09:04.794 --> 09:08.714
Judy King donated copies for every inmate.

09:09.549 --> 09:13.135
I think we should deliver them
as we progress with our sweep.

09:13.219 --> 09:15.096
Kill two birds with one stone.

09:15.179 --> 09:17.139
And to give the ladies some light reading

09:17.223 --> 09:20.601
as they're waiting for us
to toss their cells. Those who can read.

09:20.685 --> 09:23.062
CO Alvarez,
I was in the middle of speaking.

09:23.145 --> 09:24.230
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:24.313 --> 09:26.399
She had a threesome with a guard?

09:26.983 --> 09:29.402
Who's the guard who's into old pussy?

09:29.485 --> 09:32.822
-Stop passing books!

09:32.905 --> 09:35.074
No! No, put the books down!

09:36.450 --> 09:39.120
Are you fucking kidding me?

09:39.745 --> 09:41.205
A woman is dead.

09:44.667 --> 09:48.170
And make no mistake, I will fire anyone
who isn't taking this seriously.

09:48.629 --> 09:51.340
And I will fire anyone in this room

09:51.424 --> 09:55.344
responsible for turning this prison
into a drug bodega.

09:56.762 --> 10:01.142
Now, you've all seen me fire people.
Go do your fucking jobs!

10:12.528 --> 10:14.488
Look, I know we got history--

10:14.572 --> 10:16.073
Yeah

10:16.157 --> 10:18.075
The history of you
beating the shit out of me.

10:18.159 --> 10:20.953
Yeah, that was fun. Good times.

10:21.871 --> 10:23.205
Want some more? I'm in the mood.

10:23.581 --> 10:25.916
I got four grand worth of fentanyl.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.835
You want in? 60-40.

10:28.294 --> 10:29.962
Well, how about zero and 100%?

10:30.379 --> 10:32.006
I'm in here for life, Hellman.

10:32.089 --> 10:35.301
I could give it up to any Boy Scout CO
and take what comes.

10:35.384 --> 10:36.969
Doesn't make a difference to me.

10:37.053 --> 10:39.263
But I'd rather be making money,
wouldn't you?

10:39.347 --> 10:40.681
This is a sweep, dummy.

10:40.765 --> 10:42.350
What the fuck am I
supposed to do with them?

10:42.433 --> 10:43.517
You can walk out of here.

10:43.601 --> 10:46.729
How about I shove 'em down your throat
and we settle up later?

10:47.938 --> 10:50.941
Fuck. You're lucky I used my last condom

10:51.025 --> 10:52.985
fuckin' a super-hot redhead
with giant tits.

10:53.402 --> 10:57.490
Lucky me.
-70-30. I'm the 70.

11:00.242 --> 11:01.243
Fine.

11:04.205 --> 11:06.248
But if you don't pay me, I'm singing.

11:07.041 --> 11:09.293
Yeah, we'll see.

11:09.377 --> 11:10.878
You know, it's hard to sing with no teeth.

11:11.712 --> 11:13.089
I'm not fucking around.

11:18.386 --> 11:21.514
Oh, hey, you know, I gotta take a piss.
I'll be back in a jiff.

11:29.230 --> 11:30.940
All right, pick it up. Move.

11:38.948 --> 11:40.533
They already came through here.

11:42.368 --> 11:44.745
Yeah. Just double checking.

11:57.967 --> 12:00.302
Hey, I found, uh...

12:02.471 --> 12:05.641
some vape pens in the bottom
of some shower sandals. You want a hit?

12:05.725 --> 12:09.437
Are you fucking serious right now?

12:10.396 --> 12:11.856
Been a pretty rough morning.

12:20.114 --> 12:21.657
Will you get out of here?

12:23.033 --> 12:25.786
They're gonna smell that
and think it's me.

12:25.870 --> 12:27.079
It's all I need right now.

12:27.747 --> 12:29.457
Right.

12:31.500 --> 12:34.462
-I heard you got caught with a phone.
-And let me guess,

12:36.922 --> 12:38.758
you don't want me to rat you out.

12:40.050 --> 12:42.553
That's why you're here, right?
Protecting your ass?

12:44.096 --> 12:49.018
-No, I just wanted to--
-No, you're right. I should've.

12:52.146 --> 12:53.731
But I was stupid...

12:56.484 --> 13:01.197
helping those women talk to their families
instead of putting mine first.

13:03.157 --> 13:07.453
I should have been a selfish prick,
just like you,

13:08.788 --> 13:12.416
not giving a fuck whatever happens
to other people.

13:18.255 --> 13:20.466
You're a fuckin' role model, Luschek.

13:25.304 --> 13:28.057
I wanna grow up and be just like you.

13:30.518 --> 13:32.269
A fucking role model.

13:42.905 --> 13:43.906
All clear!

13:46.909 --> 13:48.410
There's nothing good in here.

14:38.878 --> 14:39.962
Ma'am.

14:40.629 --> 14:44.133
-Not a whole lot.

14:44.508 --> 14:45.342
That's it?

14:46.135 --> 14:48.554
Well, we did do a drug sweep
a few days ago.

14:48.971 --> 14:52.433
And it didn't work. Where are the drugs
that killed Ms. Doggett?

14:52.850 --> 14:53.934
Maybe she did them all?

14:55.060 --> 14:56.812
And what am I supposed to do with that?

15:00.149 --> 15:01.817
You got anything for me, Luschek?

15:01.984 --> 15:04.695
-Yeah, sure.

15:05.446 --> 15:07.573
What about phones?
This is barely anything.

15:07.656 --> 15:10.743
Oh, don't say that.
Um, there's some vape pens.

15:11.493 --> 15:13.746
A few benzos floating around
the bottom there.

15:14.246 --> 15:15.664
There's a dildo.

15:15.748 --> 15:19.126
Is the dildo in the bag
or holding the bag?

15:20.336 --> 15:21.837
It's in the... Hey!

15:24.173 --> 15:27.301
I have information
about the, uh, smuggling.

15:27.384 --> 15:30.262
-Finally, something.

15:30.346 --> 15:32.014
Drugs? No. No, no, no.

15:32.598 --> 15:35.517
No, no idea about the drugs. No idea.

15:35.601 --> 15:37.937
This is about the phone. Phones.

15:38.771 --> 15:40.731
The phone that was seized
at the other place.

15:41.690 --> 15:43.776
The, uh, detention place.

15:45.110 --> 15:48.530
-The ICE house.
-Ginger and Alvarez are handling that.

15:48.614 --> 15:51.742
But there's nothing to handle.
I know how the phones are getting in.

15:53.953 --> 15:56.288
I bring them in.

15:57.414 --> 15:59.375
It's me. I'm a phone smuggler.

15:59.750 --> 16:02.795
And, uh, Mendoza shouldn't be punished.

16:02.878 --> 16:04.004
It was Mendoza's phone?

16:05.172 --> 16:06.507
No, it was my phone.

16:07.633 --> 16:09.176
Um...

16:09.259 --> 16:13.806
I was making her sell calls
to the women in the bad place.

16:14.181 --> 16:15.349
Jesus.

16:16.183 --> 16:17.267
I can't...

16:18.936 --> 16:19.937
You're fired.

16:21.814 --> 16:23.899
-Clean out your locker.
-There's nothing in my locker.

16:25.275 --> 16:28.195
There might be a Snickers.
I hope there's a Snickers.

16:28.278 --> 16:30.739
You're fired, so get out.

16:32.074 --> 16:33.158
Get out!

16:37.621 --> 16:38.789
See you, guys.

16:39.707 --> 16:43.127
Anyone else smell burning rags?

16:43.210 --> 16:44.753
That's pot, Blake.

16:44.837 --> 16:47.673
It's the smell of marijuana
wafting off of Luschek.

16:48.549 --> 16:51.218
-Oh.
-Good Christ.

16:58.559 --> 17:00.352
Look at the little nose on you.

17:00.436 --> 17:01.437
On your face.

17:01.520 --> 17:02.730
Wow.

17:03.188 --> 17:05.524
-This is unexpected.
-Hey.

17:06.275 --> 17:07.443
Very out of context.

17:08.152 --> 17:11.655
It's kind of like seeing your math teacher
at a water park in a Speedo.

17:12.156 --> 17:15.617
This lovely lady was dropping
something off for you and I trapped her.

17:15.701 --> 17:16.994
-Huh.

17:17.494 --> 17:21.040
-Yeah, God bless 'em.

17:21.123 --> 17:24.877
Uh, my wife is Marie Kondo-ing the house.
I had to get out.

17:25.252 --> 17:27.629
-Great.

17:27.713 --> 17:30.174
It was so nice to meet you, Mr. Chapman.

17:30.257 --> 17:32.885
You, too, Zelda. Have fun in Northampton.

17:32.968 --> 17:35.220
Thank you. Bye.

17:37.765 --> 17:39.266
So, Northampton, huh?

17:40.392 --> 17:43.479
-That's my old stomping grounds.
-That's right. Smith.

17:44.229 --> 17:47.399
"In virtue, one gains knowledge."
That's the Smith motto.

17:47.483 --> 17:49.985
I think that's maybe why I feel like
I don't know anything,

17:50.069 --> 17:51.612
because I haven't been very virtuous.

17:52.112 --> 17:54.323
So, Northampton?

17:54.406 --> 17:56.033
It's for a consulting gig.

17:56.116 --> 17:58.994
I'll be up there for a few weeks,
consulting.

18:00.162 --> 18:01.955
-I'm sorry things got so weird--
-Come with me.

18:02.456 --> 18:05.209
-Come with me to Northampton.

18:05.542 --> 18:08.170
They are putting me up in this farmhouse

18:08.253 --> 18:11.173
that is like something straight out of
an indie movie about yearning.

18:11.507 --> 18:14.802
And you could use an adventure, right?
Now that you're a free woman?

18:16.136 --> 18:18.430
Things are a little complicated right now. All right, well, just think about it.

18:22.351 --> 18:25.813
For whatever it's worth,
I would really love for you to come.

18:27.981 --> 18:29.650
Here. I got you something.

18:32.402 --> 18:34.655
A bagel? Yum!

18:34.738 --> 18:36.949
It's poppy seed.

18:38.117 --> 18:40.452
-Because you're done with your parole

18:40.536 --> 18:43.080
and you don't have to worry
about testing positive for opioids.

18:43.163 --> 18:45.791
-That's very thoughtful. Thank you.
-Yeah.

18:45.874 --> 18:49.294
And perfectly timed. I am starving.

18:52.422 --> 18:53.757
Well, I will leave you to it.

18:53.841 --> 18:55.843
Mmm. Thank you.

19:01.557 --> 19:02.724
Salty.

19:04.852 --> 19:05.811
Bye.

19:06.395 --> 19:07.604
Hey, Piper?

19:08.897 --> 19:11.024
Could you give me a hand?

19:12.651 --> 19:13.652
Yeah.

19:15.404 --> 19:17.990
I tried to make the transfer,
but it didn't go well.

19:19.241 --> 19:21.660
Aww, did you give her her pacifier?

19:22.244 --> 19:23.245
No. Okay.

19:24.413 --> 19:25.622
Here, sweetie.

19:26.373 --> 19:27.207
Look at that.

19:32.129 --> 19:34.673
Piper, do you want a paci, too?
I have an elephant.

19:36.633 --> 19:38.969
Sit down. What happened?

19:40.387 --> 19:42.598
It's Alex, Dad. I'm upset over Alex.

19:43.807 --> 19:44.725
Oh.

19:45.184 --> 19:46.143
"Oh."

19:46.602 --> 19:49.980
The disapproving "oh." My lifestyle...

19:50.772 --> 19:53.275
Piper. This isn't
about you being a lesbian,

19:53.650 --> 19:56.695
you're an adult.
Make your choices, be free.

19:57.029 --> 20:00.532
But I'm an adult, too,
and I'm gonna express my opinion.

20:01.742 --> 20:02.701
I don't like Alex.

20:03.202 --> 20:04.494
She put you in prison.

20:05.162 --> 20:06.955
She continues to make you suffer.

20:07.039 --> 20:08.749
And you don't even seem to see

20:08.832 --> 20:11.043
what she's done and continues to do
with your heart.

20:11.835 --> 20:15.172
I know she's been important in your life,
but hold her up, Piper.

20:15.589 --> 20:16.632
Look closely.

20:18.008 --> 20:19.176
Does she spark joy? Oh, my God.

20:22.804 --> 20:25.307
Are you asking me to Marie Kondo my wife?

20:25.390 --> 20:29.353
Thank her for what she's been
in your life and let her go.

20:30.646 --> 20:33.315
This coming from a man
who couldn't throw out pens.

20:33.398 --> 20:35.734
I did it! You were right.

20:37.236 --> 20:38.779
Alex is not a broken pen.

20:39.363 --> 20:40.614
But she is broken.

20:42.491 --> 20:44.326
Don't you want someone whole, Piper?

20:56.463 --> 20:58.507
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

21:02.052 --> 21:03.220
Hey, come on.

21:04.888 --> 21:05.806
Let's go!

21:05.889 --> 21:07.349
-Come on.
-Five minutes!

21:07.432 --> 21:09.142
Let's go, people! Now!

21:09.226 --> 21:11.645
-Move it.
Come on! Let's go!

21:11.728 --> 21:12.896
The hell are you doing?

21:12.980 --> 21:15.565
You standing there, they'll sweep
you up along with all your shit.

21:16.024 --> 21:18.402
-Grab your stuff. It's moving day.

21:18.485 --> 21:19.903
Four minutes!

21:19.987 --> 21:25.284
Take what you want,
but please do not take any bulky items!

21:25.993 --> 21:30.372
Sir, that couch on your back
counts as a bulky item.

21:30.455 --> 21:32.082
Take that from him!

21:32.165 --> 21:33.375
Let's go, ma'am. Move it along.

21:33.709 --> 21:36.837
I'm trying to space-save here.
Please respect my packing process.

21:40.173 --> 21:42.050
You're gonna regret taking that lamp.

21:43.927 --> 21:45.637
Yeah, I regret a lot of things.

22:10.996 --> 22:13.957
Hey, I gotta toss your cell.

22:16.501 --> 22:19.546
I'll go light.
I know you've had a rough time.

22:20.464 --> 22:22.716
-Nah.

22:27.888 --> 22:28.972
All clear.

22:30.974 --> 22:33.852
So, you, uh, you holdin' up okay?

22:37.939 --> 22:39.107
I knew her, you know.

22:40.776 --> 22:41.985
What do you mean?

22:42.903 --> 22:47.491
I mean, I can say this now that she's dead
and, uh, I won't get in trouble, but...

22:49.951 --> 22:51.161
she was my friend.

22:52.621 --> 22:53.914
We were friends.

22:54.247 --> 22:55.165
Oh.

22:56.541 --> 22:57.542
Wow.

22:58.877 --> 23:00.545
I'm-- I'm sorry for your loss.

23:01.380 --> 23:03.340
Yeah, thanks.

23:06.176 --> 23:07.386
Hey, Dixon?

23:09.137 --> 23:11.807
You think you could take me over
to see Suzanne?

23:11.890 --> 23:16.061
She was friends with her, too,
and, um, I just wanna see how she's doing.

23:16.645 --> 23:18.647
Things are kinda crazy right now.

23:19.731 --> 23:23.985
Yeah, but, I mean,
I just saw somebody die.

23:24.903 --> 23:28.698
And it's not like we're on lockdown.
People are wandering around.

23:29.699 --> 23:31.326
No one's even gonna notice.

23:39.709 --> 23:40.669
Jesus.

23:41.336 --> 23:42.796
Already back to normal.

23:44.047 --> 23:45.590
Like nothing ever happened.

23:46.591 --> 23:49.970
Like a hopeful light
wasn't snuffed out too soon.

23:53.098 --> 23:54.141
Fine.

23:55.809 --> 23:56.893
Let's go.

24:03.817 --> 24:06.820
Hey, girl. Whatcha doin'?

24:07.487 --> 24:08.530
I am undoing.

24:08.613 --> 24:09.698
I see.

24:10.490 --> 24:13.034
-Chicken SHU.

24:14.744 --> 24:16.663
P-Tuck hated chicken SHU.

24:17.038 --> 24:20.250
Thought it was cruel,
and I think she might be right.

24:22.502 --> 24:23.545
And I made a mistake.

24:24.963 --> 24:28.925
I made a huge mistake,
but I'm trying to fix them.

24:30.218 --> 24:31.553
How you feelin'?

24:34.139 --> 24:35.098
Sad.

24:35.932 --> 24:36.933
Yeah.

24:37.976 --> 24:39.144
I'm sad, too.

24:40.061 --> 24:42.272
I've been sad for a while now.

24:42.355 --> 24:43.940
Losing people is hard.

24:44.900 --> 24:47.152
But, well, it's gonna happen anyway,

24:48.236 --> 24:50.155
so I'm trying to get used to it.

24:50.906 --> 24:52.324
Handle it better, you know?

24:52.741 --> 24:54.117
When people come and go.

24:56.036 --> 24:59.372
Vee came and went, and then Poussey.

25:00.207 --> 25:02.250
Then Cindy, and you.

25:03.001 --> 25:04.252
I'm standing right here.

25:04.336 --> 25:09.549
No, but you aren't you anymore.

25:11.718 --> 25:13.136
You might be right about that.

25:13.220 --> 25:14.971
No, but it's cool.

25:16.056 --> 25:19.434
I understand I can't control things.

25:21.144 --> 25:23.188
You been reading
self

25:24.481 --> 25:26.650
No. I'm growing up.

25:28.235 --> 25:29.236
It's hard,

25:30.529 --> 25:32.864
but it's happenin'.

25:38.662 --> 25:39.996
Can you help me with the chickens?

25:41.498 --> 25:43.792
Uh, I'll try.

25:44.751 --> 25:45.752
You can do it.

25:47.712 --> 25:48.797
Go!

25:49.881 --> 25:51.383
-Open the door.
-Okay.

25:51.466 --> 25:53.343
Go, chicken!
-Go, chicken.

25:53.426 --> 25:55.804
-Go! Be free!
Move your ass!

25:56.304 --> 25:59.849
-Go! Freedom!

26:02.894 --> 26:04.604
Look at 'em go!

26:07.732 --> 26:08.942
I love you, Suzanne.

26:11.403 --> 26:12.821
And I'm proud of you.

26:14.447 --> 26:18.577
Promise me you're gonna keep goin'
on your way, no matter what.

26:22.831 --> 26:24.249
This is you now.

26:26.084 --> 26:27.127
You keep goin'.

26:43.184 --> 26:45.061
Going, going, gone.

Okay, I know things
have been bumpy.

28:55.150 --> 28:56.860
I know they've been more than bumpy.

28:58.278 --> 29:00.530
I think we're still
in an adjustment period--

29:00.613 --> 29:02.449
I'm being transferred.

29:03.241 --> 29:06.035
-To Ohio.

29:06.327 --> 29:07.203
They can't do that.

29:07.287 --> 29:10.874
Oh, but they can,
and it's happening.

29:13.418 --> 29:15.003
And I think it may be a good thing.

29:17.422 --> 29:19.549
Look at what we're doing.
It's not working.

29:20.300 --> 29:22.927
Fighting and cheating and negotiating.

29:23.011 --> 29:24.012
Haven't we always?

29:24.095 --> 29:26.264
Yes, and we need to stop.

29:26.347 --> 29:28.349
-You-- I didn't want to--
-Please, I need to...

29:28.433 --> 29:29.517
Just let me finish.

29:30.685 --> 29:36.566
I just want you to know how sorry I am
for the fucked-up detour you took with me.

29:37.400 --> 29:39.402
-No.
-I want you to go and be happy...

29:40.236 --> 29:41.279
and free.

29:42.655 --> 29:45.909
Alex, you're not a detour from my life.

29:47.994 --> 29:49.329
You are my life.

29:49.996 --> 29:52.207
That doesn't mean
that we should be together.

29:54.959 --> 29:56.336
What about our marriage?

29:56.669 --> 29:58.171
You know that wasn't official.

29:59.255 --> 30:01.883
We're prison married.
You're not in prison anymore.

30:05.512 --> 30:07.806
I'll think about you every day
for the rest of my life.

30:08.556 --> 30:09.766
I hope you think about me, too,

30:09.849 --> 30:13.269
but I also hope that you find
someone else to think about.

30:14.604 --> 30:16.981
Pipes, there's just been
too much bad shit.

30:17.816 --> 30:21.361
Yes, there's been a lot of bad shit,
but I've also hurt you.

30:21.444 --> 30:22.654
-Please, stop.

30:22.737 --> 30:24.113
-You can't just--
-You know I'm right.

30:24.197 --> 30:26.115
Please stop fighting this.

30:27.617 --> 30:29.661
You need to let me go, too. I'm also asking for my freedom.

30:34.290 --> 30:35.208
Alex...

30:40.880 --> 30:43.299
I've gotta go.

30:44.717 --> 30:47.595
I love you. I love you.

30:49.347 --> 30:51.349
I will always love you.

31:44.068 --> 31:45.695
So nobody's got fucking nothing?

31:46.154 --> 31:47.363
Look, man...

31:47.447 --> 31:48.531
Squeeze your brains.

31:51.367 --> 31:53.745
We've had so many different hiding spots.

31:54.913 --> 31:56.956
There has to be one that's still packed.

31:57.040 --> 31:58.833
The rats have eaten all the cheese.

31:58.917 --> 32:01.836
Come on.<i> </i>What are y'all bitches good for?

32:06.090 --> 32:07.091
Get outta here.

32:07.634 --> 32:10.011
And when you come back,
you better have something white. Well, well, well, look who's still alive.

32:21.314 --> 32:22.398
Change of heart?

32:22.482 --> 32:24.859
Or you came
to say goodbye one last time, huh?

32:24.943 --> 32:27.862
-I changed my mind.

32:27.946 --> 32:29.530
Jury's still out on my heart.

32:30.740 --> 32:34.911
What
'Cause you look a little different.

32:35.411 --> 32:36.871
I'm tryin' something new.

32:37.455 --> 32:38.873
Focusing on the here and now,

32:38.957 --> 32:42.085
'cause life keeps throwin' me
these curveballs.

32:42.377 --> 32:45.630
Think I'm gonna keep swingin'
a little bit longer, see what I hit.

32:46.255 --> 32:49.467
Never liked baseball.
That shit's so fucking boring.

32:52.136 --> 32:54.222
Does that mean
you still got what I gave you?

32:54.305 --> 32:57.266
That's why I'm here.
I wanna trade it back.
-I need that key.

33:00.728 --> 33:03.064
Look, sooner or later,
they're gonna know it's missing,

33:03.147 --> 33:04.399
and I wanna make it right.

33:04.816 --> 33:07.235
Why would I give you the only thing
that keeps me in the drugs?

33:07.318 --> 33:10.655
Um, maybe 'cause you can't get into
the contraband locker,

33:10.738 --> 33:14.033
you probably won't for a while,
and the prison is dry

33:14.117 --> 33:17.912
and I got something that you want
right here, right now.

33:17.996 --> 33:19.372
-Hey!

33:20.707 --> 33:22.959
Look, I'm not scrapping with you, okay?

33:23.042 --> 33:25.044
You want the stuff, you give me the key.

33:25.128 --> 33:27.755
If you don't wanna trade,
I'm walkin' away. That's it.

33:27.839 --> 33:31.467
-Yo, you take one step closer to me,

33:31.551 --> 33:33.428
you ain't never gonna know
where I got 'em hid.

33:35.638 --> 33:38.599
Help me up, man. I'll give you the key.

33:39.767 --> 33:40.768
You hit hard.

33:41.853 --> 33:42.979
I'm livin' in the moment.

33:44.313 --> 33:45.231
Thank you.

33:46.315 --> 33:50.319
Hey, they were right there in your pants?

33:50.987 --> 33:53.990
I have to compliment you
on your quick thinking. Well played.

33:54.073 --> 33:58.244
I really need it.
-Yo, back off! Let me go first.

34:00.371 --> 34:03.958
And, yes, there have been setbacks,

34:04.042 --> 34:07.462
but we've also had some significant wins.

34:08.171 --> 34:09.714
I am cleaning this place up.

34:10.757 --> 34:14.761
I found the guard who was smuggling in
cell phones and immediately fired him.

34:14.844 --> 34:19.640
I let go of Hopper because of his
inappropriate relationship with an inmate.

34:19.724 --> 34:21.976
But I haven't filed criminal charges
on either one. I wanted to wait and ask you first,

34:24.395 --> 34:27.315
because I know you like
to handle these things with discretion.

34:27.398 --> 34:28.775
We can keep this in-house.

34:28.858 --> 34:30.818
Okay. Yes, that's good.

34:32.278 --> 34:35.031
Make sure those lucky assholes
don't file for severance.

34:36.199 --> 34:38.076
Fucking drug overdose.

34:38.159 --> 34:41.412
She couldn't have had an aneurysm?
How am I supposed to spin this?

34:42.455 --> 34:46.209
It is possible that she was
extorting other inmates

34:46.292 --> 34:48.127
for their pain medications, and...

34:49.545 --> 34:50.421
hoarding them.

34:52.381 --> 34:53.633
Okay, that's not bad.

34:55.051 --> 34:56.886
Maybe you're getting
the hang of this after all.

34:59.639 --> 35:00.681
What the hell?

35:01.140 --> 35:04.894
Uh, east hallway, now. Someone?
There's a chicken in the hallway.

35:06.229 --> 35:09.524
Oh, hey. I think that's
Dame Celeste Warmington the Third.

35:09.607 --> 35:12.693
Is that Tofurky?
-Get it out.

35:12.777 --> 35:14.487
Oh, God!

35:15.613 --> 35:18.241
How do we know that that thing
is not carrying disease?

35:18.324 --> 35:21.369
-Oh, you don't. Not until it's too late.
What?

35:21.452 --> 35:23.454
I'm just messing with you. You're okay.

35:24.747 --> 35:27.416
As you know, our chicken program,

35:27.500 --> 35:30.419
which, by the way,
provides free eggs for the kitchen,

35:30.753 --> 35:33.464
uh, is run by our neurodiverse inmates,

35:33.548 --> 35:37.218
so, yes, there are slipups
every now and then, but overall...

35:40.304 --> 35:42.056
If we catch 'em,
where do we put 'em?

35:45.184 --> 35:47.061
Why are there chickens
running around

35:47.145 --> 35:49.313
like chickens with their heads cut off?

35:52.441 --> 35:54.277
You. I'm pointing at you.

35:54.986 --> 35:57.572
Whatever happened,
we will get things under control.

35:58.156 --> 35:59.282
One just laid an egg.

36:20.511 --> 36:23.598
This is what my junkie cousin Jackson
takes eight times a day.

36:23.681 --> 36:25.224
And it's not ibuprofen.

36:27.977 --> 36:29.562
You are so fucking fired.

36:30.313 --> 36:31.272
Uh...

36:33.566 --> 36:34.650
Wow.

36:34.734 --> 36:35.943
Ready?

36:37.612 --> 36:41.616
That cop was rushing me.
Now the weight distribution is all off.

36:42.617 --> 36:44.076
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

36:44.911 --> 36:46.454
I gotta get me some wheels.

36:46.537 --> 36:48.456
Good thing you brought
that table lamp, though.

36:48.998 --> 36:51.417
Yo, I panicked!
This shit is all new to me.

36:51.500 --> 36:52.960
I don't know how to do this.

36:53.044 --> 36:56.714
Ooh. The do-gooder sandwich ladies.
Fuck, yeah.

36:56.797 --> 36:59.217
They think fig bars are cookies,
which they are not,

36:59.300 --> 37:03.429
but they put some useful stuff in there,
like a Target card or some type of coupon.

37:04.388 --> 37:06.682
Hey, sandwich ladies.
Can we have a couple?

37:06.766 --> 37:07.850
Of course!

37:08.559 --> 37:09.560
Here.

37:11.812 --> 37:13.856
Hi, I'm-- I'm Jennifer,

37:14.941 --> 37:17.026
and this is my son, Brian.

37:17.109 --> 37:18.986
Hi.
-Say hi, Brian.

37:19.070 --> 37:20.238
Hi.

37:20.321 --> 37:22.365
What are you, some church group?

37:22.448 --> 37:24.367
Just friends and family.

37:24.450 --> 37:27.954
I want my kids to know
that homeless people aren't bad people.

37:28.037 --> 37:32.750
They're simply the human casualties of
wealth inequality, the cycle of poverty,

37:32.833 --> 37:35.586
and the callous corporatization
of America.

37:36.128 --> 37:37.213
Wow, Brian.

37:37.296 --> 37:40.466
Your mom's got all the talking points.
You get all that?

37:41.050 --> 37:42.009
I don't know.

37:42.093 --> 37:46.055
Look, don't worry about it.
Just listen to your mom.

37:47.348 --> 37:48.724
Thanks for the goodie bags.

37:48.808 --> 37:50.977
You're welcome. It was nice to meet you.

37:52.311 --> 37:54.814
-Say goodbye, Brian.
-Bye.

37:54.897 --> 37:56.065
Bye.

38:04.031 --> 38:06.117
Is this ham

38:07.201 --> 38:08.202
Excuse me, is this ham?

38:08.286 --> 38:10.121
-Mmm-hmm.

38:10.204 --> 38:11.289
I got turkey.

38:11.998 --> 38:13.708
-Fuck, yeah.

38:19.213 --> 38:20.506
Mmm.

38:20.589 --> 38:23.467
-My bad. I'm Cindy, by the way.
-Camilla.

38:24.218 --> 38:28.306
So, what brings you
to this glamorous lifestyle?

38:29.015 --> 38:31.475
I love getting ham sandwiches
from guilty white liberals.

38:33.019 --> 38:35.062
Nah, seriously, I'm a junkie.

38:36.689 --> 38:38.733
-Delightful.
-Yeah.

38:39.984 --> 38:42.111
I'm giving my folks
some time to cool down.

38:42.945 --> 38:46.949
But based on our recent eviction,
looks like I'll have to grovel early.

38:48.451 --> 38:49.869
At least you got someplace to go.

38:50.411 --> 38:51.412
Maybe.

38:52.121 --> 38:53.539
Last time I was there,

38:54.957 --> 38:58.169
I may have stolen my grandmother's jewelry
and sold it for drugs.

38:58.252 --> 38:59.587
And your folks still let you back?

39:00.004 --> 39:02.006
It's family. They gotta let you back.

39:02.089 --> 39:04.008
Shit.

39:04.091 --> 39:05.968
You never met my mama.

39:06.385 --> 39:10.848
The way I see it, if you made a person,
you on the hook forever.

39:12.016 --> 39:15.394
No, I don't think it go like that.

39:16.604 --> 39:18.522
Yeah, you gotta fight the good fight.

39:28.282 --> 39:29.867
This is gonna be a better place for you.

39:31.494 --> 39:33.287
I mean, it's Florida.

39:33.371 --> 39:35.748
It's where you go to retire
and enjoy your life.

39:36.165 --> 39:37.708
Who are all these people?

39:40.127 --> 39:41.545
Friends you haven't met yet.

39:42.922 --> 39:46.008
Why don't you help yourself to some lunch?
There's fruit cocktail today.

39:50.721 --> 39:53.516
-I'm... Oh, Lord.

39:54.141 --> 39:56.894
I never meant to hurt you. Honest.

39:57.478 --> 40:01.107
-I was lookin' out for myself, and--
-That's okay. That's okay.

40:01.190 --> 40:05.194
I know it was an accident.
We all get clumsy in our old age.

40:06.028 --> 40:08.823
Galina Reznikov, and you are?

40:09.907 --> 40:12.785
Berlin. Frieda Berlin.

40:13.411 --> 40:15.371
Nice to meet you, Frieda Berlin.

40:17.331 --> 40:19.583
-Here, take mine.
Thank you.

40:19.667 --> 40:20.918
I-- I'll get another one.

40:21.001 --> 40:23.921
And then come sit with me.
We'll get to know each other.

40:34.348 --> 40:38.769
Do you want to hear a joke?
About a penguin, a farmer and an eggplant?

40:44.024 --> 40:45.734
Couldn't leave without saying goodbye.

40:46.068 --> 40:49.196
Goodbye

40:49.280 --> 40:51.031
That group you and Gloria found?

40:51.740 --> 40:54.076
They're bonding me out
while I fight my criminal case.

40:55.035 --> 40:56.537
I'm fucking out of here.

40:56.871 --> 40:58.706
And it's 'cause of you guys, so thank you.

41:00.082 --> 41:01.750
Would you say thanks to Gloria, please?

41:05.921 --> 41:07.506
What are you doing?
Something wrong with your eyes?

41:07.798 --> 41:09.675
No, it's an eye hug.

41:10.301 --> 41:12.219
I wanna give you a real one,

41:12.303 --> 41:15.264
but they're so far up my ass
since the phone and everything.

41:18.017 --> 41:19.810
I'm real happy for you, Blanca.

41:21.187 --> 41:22.855
I hope everything goes your way.

41:23.731 --> 41:25.816
Somebody needs a fucking win around here.

41:26.525 --> 41:29.361
Fuck that eye-hug bullshit.
I'm getting a real hug.

41:31.780 --> 41:33.574
Hey! Uh-uh.

41:34.033 --> 41:36.160
You're still in my house.
Let's go.

41:44.251 --> 41:46.879
Shitty remodel.

41:47.463 --> 41:51.967
Ugh. Look at this.
Open plan architecture is the worst.

41:52.051 --> 41:53.219
Keep it moving.

41:54.428 --> 41:57.348
Hey, Clitvack.
We need more incoming forms.

41:57.431 --> 42:00.726
What did I tell you about calling me that?
That's not my fucking name, God damn it.

42:00.809 --> 42:03.062
All right, you don't have to be
a vagina about it.

42:03.145 --> 42:05.147
I'm being a dick, not a vagina.

42:27.086 --> 42:28.170
Oh, shit.

42:31.173 --> 42:32.299
You goin' somewhere?

42:33.008 --> 42:34.385
I got fired.

42:35.427 --> 42:38.264
-Drugs fell out of a chicken's butt.

42:38.722 --> 42:39.723
For real?

42:40.599 --> 42:42.184
Like I could make this shit up.

42:44.311 --> 42:46.772
And you know what? I'm relieved.

42:47.523 --> 42:48.899
I am totally relieved.

42:50.568 --> 42:53.445
'Cause this job is too fucking much.

42:55.197 --> 42:56.240
And...

42:57.575 --> 42:59.910
those programs were never gonna work.

43:01.287 --> 43:03.205
Those women are never gonna catch a break.

43:03.289 --> 43:07.042
The system will always be what it is,
and there's not a damn thing I can do.

43:08.043 --> 43:11.171
Thank you, Tamika.

43:13.966 --> 43:15.551
You really helped me, too.

43:17.845 --> 43:21.599
-If I did, look, I'm really glad about it.
-Yeah.

43:21.682 --> 43:25.769
Especially since I'm gonna ask you
to do one last favor before you go.

43:29.732 --> 43:32.026
You mind adding this person
to my call list?

43:39.950 --> 43:41.493
Okay.

43:43.454 --> 43:45.581
Sure, I can do that.

43:46.624 --> 43:49.084
And you better put
your name on there, too.

43:49.168 --> 43:51.045
I'm gonna be checkin' up on your ass.

43:51.420 --> 43:53.631
Seeing what you're gettin' yourself into.

43:54.006 --> 43:57.635
Hear how it's goin'
with that fine-ass man of yours.

43:57.718 --> 43:59.887
-I mean, look, I ain't never met him,

43:59.970 --> 44:01.889
but I could feel the fire
through the phone.

44:01.972 --> 44:05.100
He is nice to come home to.

44:06.226 --> 44:07.227
And you...

44:08.979 --> 44:10.564
are nice to come to work with.

44:13.067 --> 44:15.194
There's a lot to be said
for knowin' someone from way back.

44:18.906 --> 44:20.491
You know you my girl.

44:22.826 --> 44:26.413
I need your meat fingers.
Honor the dead, people.

44:28.916 --> 44:30.292
Thank you.

44:31.251 --> 44:33.962
-And thank--

44:49.353 --> 44:51.480
Yo, come on up, and be quiet.

44:52.564 --> 44:55.150
Gather round. We're starting.

44:56.360 --> 44:59.321
You heard her. Shut up. We're startin'.

45:02.908 --> 45:04.827
Does everyone have a sweatshirt?

45:05.536 --> 45:07.329
Yes Good.

45:07.913 --> 45:09.915
Okay. Everybody, put your hoods up.

45:12.501 --> 45:13.544
Put your hoods up!

45:17.589 --> 45:18.799
Good.

45:18.882 --> 45:22.261
And, now, please take a cup
of yellow drink and raise it up.

45:25.055 --> 45:30.060
This feels like a cult.
Are we literally gonna drink the Kool

45:30.144 --> 45:32.980
Well, I survived it the first time, so...

45:36.150 --> 45:38.569
-To Pennsatucky.
Pennsatucky.

45:38.652 --> 45:39.778
Pennsatucky.

45:42.448 --> 45:44.908
Um, so...

45:46.368 --> 45:48.036
I don't like to sing in public...

45:48.954 --> 45:49.997
at all.

45:50.080 --> 45:53.959
But my friend P-Tuck liked
when I would sing in the bunk.

45:55.085 --> 45:56.670
She said she liked my voice.

45:56.754 --> 46:00.007
So I want you all to close your eyes,

46:00.090 --> 46:03.260
so I can sing her favorite song
and not feel like you're all...

46:03.343 --> 46:05.596
watching me, you know? So...

46:06.555 --> 46:07.639
Come on.

46:08.807 --> 46:10.768
I see eyes open.

46:11.685 --> 46:13.604
-People! Have some--
Suzanne.

46:13.687 --> 46:15.439
Might I make a suggestion?

46:15.522 --> 46:19.151
Maybe instead of asking everyone
to close their eyes so they can't see you,

46:19.234 --> 46:21.528
you should close your eyes
so you can't see them.

46:23.405 --> 46:24.656
I will do that.

46:25.783 --> 46:27.826
That is a fine solution.

46:34.708 --> 46:35.751
Okay.

46:39.713 --> 46:40.964

<i>-♪ With that good old Mountain Dew ♪</i>
<i>-♪ Give me the sunshine ♪</i>

49:20.123 --> 49:21.458
Hey, <i>cabrona!</i>

49:21.541 --> 49:23.627
Where you think you're goin'
without sayin' goodbye?

49:24.252 --> 49:25.879
I know you ain't gonna do me like that.

49:35.263 --> 49:36.515
Who doesn't love a guard fucker?

49:40.102 --> 49:41.103
I'll be fine.

49:44.231 --> 49:46.817
Now, get the hell out of here,
and don't be a fool like me.

49:49.403 --> 49:50.529
I love you, mama. I love you, too.

50:06.628 --> 50:12.300
Gloria, I just wanna thank you
for fessin' up to the phone.

50:15.345 --> 50:16.930
I'm really glad you're still gettin' out.

50:17.806 --> 50:18.724
I got fuckin' lucky.

50:18.807 --> 50:21.435
Luschek finally did
something good in his life.

50:21.518 --> 50:23.687
But don't you be confused
as to why I did what I did.

50:23.770 --> 50:24.688
It wasn't for you.

50:29.234 --> 50:32.654
Oh, man, I'm gonna miss you.

50:35.157 --> 50:37.617
I left my shower caddy on your bunk.

50:39.286 --> 50:41.204
I'm gonna keep doing the work, Gloria.

50:42.456 --> 50:43.415
We helped people.

50:43.790 --> 50:46.251
Hey, listen to me.
You gotta put you first.

50:46.835 --> 50:48.837
Maritza would want me to be doin' this.

50:49.671 --> 50:52.049
Plus, I feel like I'm in a spy movie.

50:52.132 --> 50:54.301
-And I got everyone saying "Clitvack."

50:56.762 --> 50:57.721
I'm in.

50:59.222 --> 51:02.768
Then you be careful, okay? You promise me.

51:03.727 --> 51:04.811
I promise.

51:10.692 --> 51:11.568
I gotta go now.

51:12.486 --> 51:16.198
I know. I'm happy for you.

51:17.824 --> 51:19.159
I'm happy for me, too.

51:27.793 --> 51:29.419
Knock 'em dead, baby.

51:37.803 --> 51:38.929
Come on.

51:42.057 --> 51:47.020
Come see my room.
It's a celebration of maximalism.

51:47.104 --> 51:49.064
Oh, my God.

51:49.147 --> 51:53.235
Frieda Berlin, how can you live like this?

51:53.568 --> 51:56.279
-This is squalor.
-I like it.

51:56.363 --> 51:57.572
Keeps the people away.

51:57.656 --> 52:01.243
I don't think you should close that door.
We need air circulation.

52:05.872 --> 52:07.791
Can I trust you with a secret?

52:07.874 --> 52:10.585
I can't remember
a fucking thing these days.

52:10.669 --> 52:11.670
I think you're good.

52:25.225 --> 52:27.477
You can't be serious.

52:27.561 --> 52:30.605
What else I got to do? Keeps me amused.

52:31.606 --> 52:34.526
And the garbage keeps everyone away.

52:34.860 --> 52:37.904
Ridiculous,
but if it makes you happy, fine.

52:37.988 --> 52:41.491
Now, please open that door again.
My eyes are burning.

52:46.037 --> 52:48.415
You know, you remind me of someone.

52:49.583 --> 52:51.126
I can't quite place it.

52:53.461 --> 52:56.173
One of these days,
I'll put my finger on it.

52:59.426 --> 53:00.385
Okay.

53:16.776 --> 53:18.778
-You look good.

53:18.862 --> 53:21.907
I got one of those Peloton bikes.
Sometimes, I do the workouts.

53:21.990 --> 53:24.492
Sometimes, I just jerk off
to the hot instructors.

53:25.160 --> 53:26.786
I consider that exercise.

53:28.538 --> 53:31.499
-It's good to see you.
-Yeah, well, it's hard to see you.

53:34.628 --> 53:38.089
I'm a mother and I'm Latina.
He messed with my kid. Boom.

53:38.173 --> 53:40.926
Yeah. Heard your
pasty white knight got fired.

53:42.010 --> 53:43.053
You got a plan B?

53:43.345 --> 53:47.307
'Cause I'm sitting on a big, fat pillow
right now and I need to lay it off.

53:47.390 --> 53:48.975
I'm thinkin' about it.

53:49.059 --> 53:52.854
Meanwhile, Daya's got a connect
I don't know about

53:52.938 --> 53:55.357
and she's playin' <i>Scarface</i> around here.

53:55.440 --> 53:58.735
And if I find out that you're her connect
and the two of you are screwing me,

53:58.818 --> 54:02.739
I will break out of here
and rip your balls off, you hear me?

54:02.822 --> 54:03.698
You don't know?

54:04.658 --> 54:06.409
-Oh, man...

54:06.493 --> 54:08.328
Just fuckin' tell me what you know, Cesar.

54:08.828 --> 54:11.248
-Her connect is Eva.

54:11.331 --> 54:12.749
Eva, your daughter.

54:13.917 --> 54:17.003
She's the middle between
Daya and this guy, Armando.

54:18.797 --> 54:22.842
Are you fucking kidding me?
She dragged Eva into this?

54:24.302 --> 54:29.557
Listen to me. You gotta get to this guy
Armando and cut her off.

54:29.641 --> 54:31.017
I can't do that, Aleida.

54:31.101 --> 54:33.645
But he's your competition.
Take him the fuck out.

54:33.728 --> 54:35.105
There's room for everybody.

54:36.690 --> 54:38.984
And this is my cousin's wife's brother.

54:39.317 --> 54:41.236
I am not fucking with that.

54:41.319 --> 54:44.447
-Louis. The one who went to art school.

54:44.531 --> 54:46.074
So why he ain't makin' art, then?

54:46.157 --> 54:50.036
He is. He's doin' mixed media sculpture.

54:51.162 --> 54:53.623
And this is Louis' brother-in-law.

54:54.624 --> 54:57.002
And they're makin' good money.

54:57.919 --> 54:59.671
Neither one of them is gonna cut it out.

55:00.588 --> 55:01.798
I can't have that.

55:04.801 --> 55:07.053
I can't have another one
fucked up like that.

55:08.471 --> 55:09.431
Uh-uh.

55:10.307 --> 55:11.349
No.

55:16.229 --> 55:17.188
One...

55:17.897 --> 55:19.774
One second! Oh, God.

55:20.608 --> 55:21.526
Shit.

55:28.450 --> 55:29.284
Piper.

55:29.659 --> 55:30.952
I don't know what I'm doing here.

55:31.828 --> 55:35.290
Well, that makes two of us. Are you okay?

55:35.623 --> 55:37.083
I just started walking,

55:37.167 --> 55:40.170
and it's like I have a homing instinct
from when I lived here.

55:41.629 --> 55:44.549
Also, I have to pee. Is Polly home?

55:44.924 --> 55:47.886
No, she's not. But come in.
We have a bathroom.

55:47.969 --> 55:50.638
-Well, you know that we have a bathroom.
-I do.

55:56.144 --> 55:57.103
Butterscotch?

55:57.896 --> 56:01.024
There's also starlight mint
and root beer barrel.

56:01.107 --> 56:03.068
She's working on soaps
inspired by the candy

56:03.151 --> 56:05.612
next to cash registers
in middle-tier restaurants.

56:06.196 --> 56:08.156
Wow. That's specific.

56:08.239 --> 56:10.617
Yeah. That's my lady.

56:10.700 --> 56:13.787
I mean... well, that's what I mean.

56:16.081 --> 56:17.290
The room looks different.

56:18.208 --> 56:20.960
Yeah. Yeah, Polly redecorated.

56:21.544 --> 56:23.296
And then re-redecorated.

56:24.005 --> 56:26.341
Third time's the charm. Well, for now.

56:26.883 --> 56:30.053
It tends to happen when she's stressed,
and, you know, with the baby,

56:31.262 --> 56:33.348
I suspect a new couch
is coming any day now.

56:36.935 --> 56:37.894
Oh.

56:39.562 --> 56:42.232
Piper, you know-- you know I'm not...
I'm not good with the crying.

56:42.982 --> 56:44.776
Alex broke up with me.

56:45.527 --> 56:48.071
She said she wanted to set me free.

56:50.740 --> 56:52.200
I don't know what to do.

56:52.659 --> 56:56.746
Celebrate? Sorry. I'm sorry. Old scars.

56:58.039 --> 57:00.708
-Here. Wipe your nose.

57:04.712 --> 57:07.257
This could have been my living room.

57:09.134 --> 57:11.052
These could have been my boogie wipes.

57:12.554 --> 57:13.513
No.

57:14.722 --> 57:16.266
No, Piper, they couldn't.

57:17.851 --> 57:20.186
Because you didn't actually
want to be with me.

57:20.812 --> 57:23.648
You wanted to be with Alex.
You always wanted to be with Alex.

57:23.731 --> 57:27.652
Larry... Larry, I wanted to be with you.

57:29.988 --> 57:30.905
But Alex...

57:31.865 --> 57:35.160
It's like, we met,

57:36.578 --> 57:38.079
and I grew another limb.

57:40.248 --> 57:42.709
And, like, she's a part of my body.

57:46.129 --> 57:47.839
And now she doesn't want to be with me.

57:49.048 --> 57:51.634
That's not what she said.
She said she wants to set you free.

57:53.011 --> 57:54.721
And I think that's really nice of her.

57:55.930 --> 57:58.016
Because I also think
she's a destructive piece of shit.

57:58.099 --> 58:01.060
Please do not say anything mean.
I know you all think she ruined my life.

58:01.144 --> 58:02.437
-But, please.
-No. Hold on.

58:02.520 --> 58:03.771
I didn't say that, and...

58:05.815 --> 58:07.150
I don't think that.

58:08.151 --> 58:10.820
In fact, I think in a lot of ways,
she made your life.

58:11.696 --> 58:14.699
I think you were this cute blonde girl
from Connecticut,

58:15.909 --> 58:19.162
going to Smith, on your road.

58:20.288 --> 58:22.123
And you looked ahead and saw everything,

58:22.207 --> 58:24.375
your whole life
just laid out in front of you,

58:24.459 --> 58:26.961
this nice life, this normal life,

58:27.921 --> 58:32.050
and a part of you said, "Fuck that.
I want to be special."

58:33.718 --> 58:35.678
Alex was your ticket to special.

58:36.888 --> 58:38.806
You got to live this life of intrigue.

58:39.933 --> 58:41.559
You were above the law.

58:41.643 --> 58:44.938
And then you got scared
and you reverted back to your old path.

58:45.897 --> 58:48.733
That's me, right?
And our-- And our life together.

58:50.443 --> 58:53.404
And you saw this life
laid out in front of you,

58:53.488 --> 58:54.989
this nice life, this normal life,

58:55.073 --> 58:59.702
and this time you said, "Fuck it.
I'm tired. Let's do this."

59:01.162 --> 59:03.122
But I think that restless part of you,

59:04.332 --> 59:06.501
it just would have risen up
again at some point.

59:08.002 --> 59:11.548
So, lucky for all of us
that Alex named you,

59:12.423 --> 59:15.385
because now, once again, you're special.

59:15.468 --> 59:16.427
Jesus.

59:17.011 --> 59:20.557
When did you formulate this theory
about me and my life motivations?

59:21.057 --> 59:23.184
Been working on it for a little while now.

59:23.935 --> 59:26.646
Going over it in my head. Talked to two
different therapists about it.

59:26.729 --> 59:28.398
They both think
I've nailed you, by the way.

59:28.481 --> 59:30.149
I did not want to go to prison, Larry.

59:30.233 --> 59:31.734
-I'm sure.
-It was awful.

59:31.818 --> 59:32.819
I believe you.

59:33.653 --> 59:36.864
But I also think maybe this was
the best thing that ever happened to you,

59:37.824 --> 59:40.451
because now you can never be
nice and normal again.

59:41.536 --> 59:42.704
You're the ex-con...

59:43.871 --> 59:47.208
which, in our circles, is quite exotic.

59:47.750 --> 59:49.377
We're not in the same circles.

59:49.460 --> 59:52.672
Because look-- Look at the choices
that you're making, Piper.

59:52.755 --> 59:55.341
That woman that we met the night
that we all went out to dinner?

59:55.675 --> 59:56.968
She's great.

59:58.344 --> 59:59.679
She's hot. She--

1:00:00.763 --> 1:00:01.889
She has a cool job.

1:00:02.307 --> 1:00:05.351
-She has an amazing apartment.
-She has an amazing apartment.

1:00:05.435 --> 1:00:07.437
She's on her way and she likes you.

1:00:08.313 --> 1:00:10.064
And all you can think about is Alex.

1:00:11.232 --> 1:00:12.609
Because I love Alex.

1:00:14.027 --> 1:00:16.404
Yeah, because you love Alex.

1:00:17.655 --> 1:00:19.198
But also because

1:00:20.366 --> 1:00:23.411
you love what being with Alex represents.

1:00:23.494 --> 1:00:24.787
Larry, stop.

1:00:26.331 --> 1:00:27.665
This is bullshit.

1:00:28.416 --> 1:00:30.335
-You don't know me anymore.

1:00:30.418 --> 1:00:34.505
You may have known a version of me,
but you have no idea who I am now.

1:00:35.548 --> 1:00:37.550
This whole narrative you created?

1:00:39.385 --> 1:00:41.220
I am not that self-destructive.

1:00:43.139 --> 1:00:44.807
-No.

1:00:47.685 --> 1:00:49.103
I am heartbroken.

1:00:51.314 --> 1:00:53.691
And I do not know what to do.

1:00:59.614 --> 1:01:01.074
I might go to Northampton.

1:01:01.699 --> 1:01:04.077
-No. Zelda's in Northampton.

1:01:04.160 --> 1:01:06.996
-She asked me to come join her.
Well, see? Great, there you go.

1:01:07.080 --> 1:01:09.290
You've got choices.
You can go to Northampton

1:01:09.374 --> 1:01:12.877
-and see what that's all about.
-Or I might stay here and wait for Alex.

1:01:14.462 --> 1:01:15.505
Yeah.

1:01:16.547 --> 1:01:21.469
Of course, there's that, yeah.
I would probably put some money on that.

1:01:23.513 --> 1:01:25.890
You are working off an old version of me.

1:01:28.267 --> 1:01:31.187
Okay, then here's my advice.

1:01:33.106 --> 1:01:35.316
Go do what new Piper would do.

1:01:48.913 --> 1:01:52.792
Hey there, stretch.
Do you wanna play spit?

1:01:52.875 --> 1:01:55.128
I am strictly an Egyptian Rat Screw gal.

1:01:55.211 --> 1:01:57.672
I don't need to hear this
about your personal life.

1:01:59.757 --> 1:02:00.842
So, what's up?

1:02:01.968 --> 1:02:03.219
Did you come to reveal the truth

1:02:03.302 --> 1:02:05.513
that my great-grandmother
had an affair with a clown,

1:02:05.596 --> 1:02:08.099
thus explaining the hair
and my love of tiny cars?

1:02:08.182 --> 1:02:09.225
Well, yes.

1:02:09.851 --> 1:02:13.604
And his name was Tickles Goldberg
and he invented the rubber chicken.

1:02:14.689 --> 1:02:17.108
You've some giant red and yellow
shoes to fill, Nichols.

1:02:17.734 --> 1:02:18.776
I knew it.

1:02:23.156 --> 1:02:27.118
I came to say goodbye.
I'm being transferred to Ohio.

1:02:28.119 --> 1:02:29.036
Ohio?

1:02:30.413 --> 1:02:32.832
Hey, what the fuck did you do
to deserve Ohio?

1:02:34.167 --> 1:02:35.209
Something bad.

1:02:36.210 --> 1:02:38.921
Okay, well, you know,
I would love to hear the details,

1:02:39.005 --> 1:02:42.216
but, uh, something tells me
you're not gonna spill.

1:02:43.092 --> 1:02:44.343
I don't kiss and tell.

1:02:44.677 --> 1:02:47.221
So, there was kissing involved?

1:02:48.681 --> 1:02:50.558
You know what? This makes perfect sense.

1:02:50.641 --> 1:02:53.561
I mean, you're one of
the last people in my life here,

1:02:53.644 --> 1:02:57.774
so, of course the vengeful gods
just had to get rid of you.

1:03:00.318 --> 1:03:01.819
Hey, I'm sorry if it's my fault.

1:03:02.403 --> 1:03:04.864
No, I think the bad juju on this
is all me.

1:03:07.492 --> 1:03:09.243
How are you and blondie dealing with this?

1:03:11.245 --> 1:03:12.246
Separately.

1:03:14.040 --> 1:03:15.833
Prison is just not as romantic

1:03:15.917 --> 1:03:18.503
as all those '70s exploitation movies
made it seem.

1:03:19.587 --> 1:03:20.671
I want my money back.

1:03:22.215 --> 1:03:23.674
I want a lot of things back.

1:03:26.385 --> 1:03:27.595
So this is it, huh?

1:03:29.639 --> 1:03:31.224
The band is broken up.

1:03:32.809 --> 1:03:35.019
Well, maybe one day
we'll do a reunion tour.

1:03:35.561 --> 1:03:36.979
Play all our greatest hits.

1:03:37.063 --> 1:03:37.897
Mmm.

1:03:38.981 --> 1:03:40.441
All the favorites, right?

1:03:41.108 --> 1:03:44.779
Yeah, "Squat and Cough," "Foot Fungus,"

1:03:45.196 --> 1:03:47.907
and of course, our number one hit,

1:03:47.990 --> 1:03:51.118
"Anything Can Be a Dildo
If You're Brave Enough," right?

1:03:51.202 --> 1:03:54.372
I mean, the fans are gonna just eat it up.

1:04:00.044 --> 1:04:01.379
Ohio.

1:04:17.895 --> 1:04:18.813
Thanks for meeting me.

1:04:23.276 --> 1:04:25.695
You want a soda or something?
I got this coupon.

1:04:25.778 --> 1:04:28.906
Monica has debate practice
in a half an hour, so...

1:04:29.073 --> 1:04:31.617
Oh. Yeah, you debatin' now, huh?

1:04:32.660 --> 1:04:35.288
I bet you good at it. That's from me.

1:04:36.247 --> 1:04:38.708
Always could argue like nobody's business.

1:04:40.209 --> 1:04:41.085
Why am I here?

1:04:44.255 --> 1:04:45.464
'Cause I made you.

1:04:46.299 --> 1:04:49.510
And I ain't ever been too good
at keepin' at something,

1:04:49.594 --> 1:04:53.890
but the woman who made me
taught me better than that.

1:04:55.683 --> 1:04:58.185
She showed me better than that.

1:05:01.063 --> 1:05:04.901
'Cause she kept after you
and she kept showin' up.

1:05:05.818 --> 1:05:07.111
And I wanna be like her.

1:05:08.905 --> 1:05:09.906
So I'm here.

1:05:10.781 --> 1:05:13.826
And I'm gonna be here
every Sunday at eleven o'clock.

1:05:14.410 --> 1:05:19.332
And I wanna tell you about
what I been doin' and thinkin'.

1:05:20.082 --> 1:05:21.626
And I want you to tell me stuff,

1:05:22.627 --> 1:05:25.046
or you can just sit there and act all mad.

1:05:26.756 --> 1:05:28.841
But I'm still gonna be here, Monica.

1:05:30.134 --> 1:05:32.136
And I'm gonna prove to you
that you can trust me.

1:05:32.219 --> 1:05:33.846
That the both of you can trust me.

1:05:34.263 --> 1:05:36.557
Every Sunday, eleven o'clock.

1:05:37.975 --> 1:05:39.018
Right here.

1:05:41.312 --> 1:05:42.480
You gonna show her?

1:05:43.397 --> 1:05:44.982
How you gonna show her?

1:05:45.399 --> 1:05:48.402
By sittin' in some fast food restaurant
every week?

1:05:55.284 --> 1:05:57.036
I wanna tell you about your dad.

1:06:00.998 --> 1:06:02.792
His name was Curtis.

1:06:04.710 --> 1:06:06.796
And I really, really liked him...

1:06:08.756 --> 1:06:09.966
but he had a girlfriend.

1:06:13.552 --> 1:06:15.304
And he chose her over me.

1:06:18.057 --> 1:06:19.475
But I chose you.

1:06:29.110 --> 1:06:30.403
Deacon?

1:06:32.488 --> 1:06:33.489
Deacon!

1:06:33.864 --> 1:06:36.242
-Yes, Judy.

1:06:36.951 --> 1:06:39.161
The ones that came in the basket
from that German publisher.

1:06:39.245 --> 1:06:40.621
They look like little cigars.

1:06:40.705 --> 1:06:43.374
They're filled with some kind
of hazelnut chocolaty something?

1:06:43.457 --> 1:06:45.292
-Choco Heim.

1:06:45.376 --> 1:06:46.669
They're called Choco Heim.

1:06:46.961 --> 1:06:50.006
Well, that is a silly name.
I would like three, please.

1:06:50.089 --> 1:06:51.132
I'll be right back.

1:06:51.757 --> 1:06:56.053
Oh, honey, I do so love
watchin' you walk away.

1:06:56.721 --> 1:06:57.805
That's harassment.

1:06:57.888 --> 1:06:59.932
Oh, you love it.

1:07:06.689 --> 1:07:07.857
Deacon?

1:07:09.025 --> 1:07:11.360
Deacon, the phone is... Oh, God damn it.

1:07:14.113 --> 1:07:16.657
<i>Hello. An inmate</i>
<i>from Litchfield Correctional Facility</i>

1:07:16.741 --> 1:07:18.951
<i>is trying to contact you. Do you accept?</i>

1:07:19.535 --> 1:07:22.163
Uh, fine, I accept.

1:07:25.916 --> 1:07:26.917
Hello?

1:07:27.001 --> 1:07:28.044
Judy King?

1:07:28.711 --> 1:07:31.547
Oh, my God, yo, I can't believe
you picked up.

1:07:31.630 --> 1:07:33.883
I've been calling every day and some dick
kept telling me you was out

1:07:33.966 --> 1:07:35.760
and I knew you wasn't, so I kept saying,

1:07:35.843 --> 1:07:38.971
"Yo, you got to put me through
because this is Tasha Jefferson

1:07:39.055 --> 1:07:40.806
and we had a mutual friend in common,

1:07:40.890 --> 1:07:42.266
-Poussey Washington."
-Poussey.

1:07:42.349 --> 1:07:43.851
<i>"And I know she'd wanna talk to me,</i>

1:07:43.934 --> 1:07:47.605
because I'm starting a fund
in Poussey's name

1:07:47.688 --> 1:07:51.358
that would give microloans
to ex-felons after they've been released,

1:07:51.442 --> 1:07:53.861
and with her whole book
coming out and all,

1:07:53.944 --> 1:07:56.489
I thought it could be
a great altruistic tie-in

1:07:56.572 --> 1:07:57.865
if she wanted to get involved."

1:07:57.948 --> 1:08:00.534
<i>-If you wanted to get involved.</i>

1:08:00.618 --> 1:08:03.287
I'm talkin' fast 'cause I don't have
that much money left on my phone account

1:08:03.370 --> 1:08:05.956
'cause of all the calls
I've been making to you every day. But...

1:08:06.582 --> 1:08:08.793
Hello

1:08:09.585 --> 1:08:11.629
I'm listening. Now, how would it work?

1:08:11.712 --> 1:08:14.048
Well, I got a whole plan, see?

1:08:14.131 --> 1:08:16.592
And it all starts with people learnin'
how to handle they money.

1:08:16.675 --> 1:08:18.511
'Cause if you don't understand
your financials,

1:08:18.594 --> 1:08:20.221
you headed straight into trouble.

1:08:20.304 --> 1:08:22.056
You do realize
you're speaking with someone

1:08:22.139 --> 1:08:23.724
who went to prison for tax evasion?

1:08:23.808 --> 1:08:27.228
Oh, shit. Yo, that's right.

1:08:27.311 --> 1:08:28.354
Uh, yeah.

1:08:28.437 --> 1:08:30.397
So you already know
what I'm talking about.

1:08:30.481 --> 1:08:32.691
I knew I was calling the right person.

1:08:32.775 --> 1:08:36.946
Yo, by the way,
your book is blowing up in here.

1:08:37.029 --> 1:08:39.615
<i>-Yo, everybody's reading it.</i>

1:08:39.698 --> 1:08:41.075
Is grass green?

1:08:41.158 --> 1:08:43.994
Oh, well, I'll be.
What parts do they like best?

1:08:44.703 --> 1:08:45.996
Girl, the dirty parts.

1:08:47.790 --> 1:08:49.250
Well, well, well. Hello, pretty.

1:08:56.173 --> 1:08:57.258
Hey, Red.

1:09:00.302 --> 1:09:03.889
Yeah. I'm writin' to my baby.

1:09:04.557 --> 1:09:09.145
The father's keepin' him away from me,
so I write him every day,

1:09:09.228 --> 1:09:11.605
and I'm saving 'em up
so when we're together again,

1:09:11.689 --> 1:09:13.440
he can hear about what I was doing

1:09:13.524 --> 1:09:15.651
and know that I was always
thinkin' of him.

1:09:16.485 --> 1:09:18.696
May I? Aw, how sweet.

1:09:23.284 --> 1:09:24.869
I don't quite get
what you're saying,

1:09:24.952 --> 1:09:27.371
but I know you're sympathetic to my cause.

1:09:28.497 --> 1:09:31.667
Because us mothers,
we have to stick together, right?

1:09:32.835 --> 1:09:34.044
It's about character.

1:09:35.421 --> 1:09:38.883
It's about who shows up for you
and who you show up for.

1:09:39.800 --> 1:09:43.596
When you're young, you learn this.
When you have children, you teach this.

1:09:43.679 --> 1:09:46.432
When you're old, you hope you remember.

1:09:48.058 --> 1:09:52.104
My little one is teething
and I hear if you rub rum into their gums,

1:09:52.188 --> 1:09:54.607
it helps with the pain
and they sleep better.

1:09:54.899 --> 1:09:56.734
Frozen wash cloth. You wet it,

1:09:56.817 --> 1:09:59.236
put it in the freezer and then
you let them chew on it.

1:09:59.320 --> 1:10:00.821
The cold is soothing.

1:10:00.905 --> 1:10:03.866
Frozen wash cloth. That's a good tip.

1:10:07.369 --> 1:10:09.663
I was supposed to see my grandson.

1:10:09.747 --> 1:10:12.666
That's so sweet. Is he teething, too?

1:10:13.125 --> 1:10:15.628
I don't know. I didn't see him.

1:10:17.463 --> 1:10:18.923
Something happened.

1:10:29.099 --> 1:10:30.017
Frieda.

1:10:30.601 --> 1:10:33.437
Oh, no, she doesn't have no kids.
She's not in our club.

1:10:33.854 --> 1:10:36.941
I remember. I remember.

1:10:37.900 --> 1:10:39.401
I remember!

1:10:45.157 --> 1:10:49.036
No, thanks. I'm gonna
wait it out till you lose your mind again.

1:10:50.120 --> 1:10:53.123
And then maybe we'll play
a few hands of gin.

1:10:53.207 --> 1:10:55.167
-I'll kill you!
-That's enough, Red.

1:10:55.251 --> 1:10:57.920
Back it up. Back it up!

1:10:58.003 --> 1:10:59.129
Kill her!

1:11:00.673 --> 1:11:01.882
Back it up!

1:11:02.508 --> 1:11:03.425
What's going on?

1:11:04.301 --> 1:11:06.303
She didn't get to see her grandson.

1:11:06.387 --> 1:11:07.221
Oh.

1:11:07.930 --> 1:11:10.766
Or maybe she did
and they made her forget.

1:11:17.147 --> 1:11:18.315
Look.

1:11:18.399 --> 1:11:21.860
You wanna go talk to her alone,
now's your shot. Go.

1:11:21.944 --> 1:11:24.280
Can you also get me a glass of water
while you're up?

1:11:24.363 --> 1:11:27.741
Sure. 'Cause that's what
I'm thinkin' about right now. Your thirst.

1:11:32.830 --> 1:11:35.874
Your little sister

1:11:37.751 --> 1:11:39.086
It's the family business, right?

1:11:39.169 --> 1:11:42.589
It's something you do
so your kids don't have to.

1:11:42.673 --> 1:11:45.884
I don't have to.
I want to, and so does Eva.

1:11:46.635 --> 1:11:49.847
She's gonna make so much money
so she can get her own place,

1:11:49.930 --> 1:11:51.390
move all the kids in with her

1:11:51.473 --> 1:11:54.435
so they don't have to live
with your loser-ass boyfriend,

1:11:54.935 --> 1:11:56.812
who don't even got a job now.

1:11:57.813 --> 1:11:59.023
She's a kid, Daya.

1:11:59.815 --> 1:12:01.692
You're gonna wreck her fucking life.

1:12:02.151 --> 1:12:03.819
-Fine.

1:12:06.071 --> 1:12:07.448
Don't be like me.

1:12:07.906 --> 1:12:09.074
I'm not like you.

1:12:09.992 --> 1:12:11.076
I'm in charge.

1:12:12.578 --> 1:12:13.704
What happened to you?

1:12:14.997 --> 1:12:16.081
You used to be sweet.

1:12:17.082 --> 1:12:19.376
Drawing and talking about boring shit.

1:12:20.794 --> 1:12:25.090
Who's this evil junkie?
I-- I don't even recognize you.

1:12:27.176 --> 1:12:29.261
You know what it's like to kill somebody?

1:12:31.305 --> 1:12:33.098
Nah, didn't think so.

1:12:33.766 --> 1:12:36.518
Get in line. Leave the family stuff to me,

1:12:36.602 --> 1:12:38.520
'cause Eva's gonna do
whatever I tell her to do,

1:12:38.604 --> 1:12:40.397
and we maybe even bringing Lucy in. Who else can I trust but family, right?

1:12:52.493 --> 1:12:55.662
Maybe I'll know what it's like now.

1:13:24.108 --> 1:13:25.234
Follow, follow.

1:13:25.317 --> 1:13:27.736
Follow, keep walking. Follow, follow.
Get up.

1:13:29.071 --> 1:13:30.864
Get up. Come on. We can't wait for you.

1:13:30.948 --> 1:13:32.783
I think something is broken.

1:13:34.701 --> 1:13:36.120
Your ankle?

1:13:39.706 --> 1:13:41.208
Get up. Get up.

1:13:41.291 --> 1:13:43.460
Let me see if you can step on it.
Step on it.

1:13:43.544 --> 1:13:44.503
Okay.

1:13:53.345 --> 1:13:54.596
Thank you so much.

1:13:55.264 --> 1:13:56.890
Oh dear God, bless you.

1:13:56.974 --> 1:13:57.975
Thank you.

1:14:11.447 --> 1:14:12.281
Here.

1:14:14.741 --> 1:14:16.160
I leave you here. I'm sorry.

1:14:16.702 --> 1:14:17.536
Please.

1:14:17.619 --> 1:14:18.829
Please! Help me!

1:14:19.455 --> 1:14:21.165
My babies are on the other side.

1:14:21.248 --> 1:14:22.374
I have to make it.

1:14:22.458 --> 1:14:25.544
I understand, but I have to get all these
other people out of the desert.

1:14:26.545 --> 1:14:27.796
Listen, I'll try to come back for you.

1:14:27.880 --> 1:14:29.590
But right now I can't wait. Okay?
I have to go.

1:14:30.507 --> 1:14:31.341
Please!

1:14:33.427 --> 1:14:34.970
Don't leave me here!

1:14:36.638 --> 1:14:37.723
Please!

1:14:49.985 --> 1:14:51.987
No!

1:14:58.285 --> 1:14:59.453
No!

1:15:03.540 --> 1:15:07.544
<i>♪ America, America ♪</i>

1:15:07.628 --> 1:15:11.590

1:15:11.673 --> 1:15:15.928

1:15:35.405 --> 1:15:36.615
I want a boy.

1:15:37.282 --> 1:15:39.660
Boys always love their mothers best.

1:15:40.619 --> 1:15:44.873
I'm fine with that. And a little one.
No older than two.

1:15:44.957 --> 1:15:47.876
It's important to get in there early.
Teach him the right things.

1:15:47.960 --> 1:15:50.170
Like how not to sexually harass women?

1:15:52.256 --> 1:15:53.465
What if he's gay?

1:15:54.174 --> 1:15:57.386
We gotta teach him
to not sexually harass men, too.

1:15:58.178 --> 1:16:00.847
Then we gotta teach him
not to harass the nonbinary.

1:16:00.931 --> 1:16:04.309
If he, in fact,
wants to be referred to as "him."

1:16:05.477 --> 1:16:07.145
We may get a "they."

1:16:08.063 --> 1:16:09.106
I want a boy.

1:16:10.148 --> 1:16:11.233
So do I.

1:16:12.776 --> 1:16:15.153
I'm Vanessa! I like your dress.

1:16:17.531 --> 1:16:18.490
Wanna hear me sing?

1:16:20.117 --> 1:16:21.577

I never prepared them

1:17:01.908 --> 1:17:03.493
Of course they turned to drugs.

1:17:56.880 --> 1:17:58.382
Make magic with these spuds.

1:18:00.634 --> 1:18:02.427
Day three of detox is rough.

1:18:06.598 --> 1:18:09.309
Here's a bucket. Just get it out.
We'll keep going.

1:18:09.393 --> 1:18:11.853
Lots to do. So barf-barf, chop-chop.

1:18:12.979 --> 1:18:14.439
You're gonna be okay.

1:18:17.901 --> 1:18:21.571
I'll try. I can't promise
you anything, okay? But I'll try.

1:18:28.036 --> 1:18:29.496
No promises, okay?

1:18:40.215 --> 1:18:41.091
One more.

1:18:41.174 --> 1:18:43.552
-Ah.

1:18:47.639 --> 1:18:52.519
Oh, wow, that's beautiful. Good job.
I think you got it.

1:18:52.602 --> 1:18:53.645
Good job.

1:19:11.121 --> 1:19:14.332
My donkey, my donkey

1:19:14.416 --> 1:19:16.710
has a sore throat,

1:19:17.878 --> 1:19:19.880
...the doctor gave him

1:19:20.005 --> 1:19:22.299
a white scarf!

1:19:26.219 --> 1:19:29.097
New Maria,
you read the next part.

1:19:29.431 --> 1:19:30.474
Put some feeling behind it,

1:19:30.557 --> 1:19:33.351
because you gotta keep her interested
when you read to her at home.

1:19:33.435 --> 1:19:35.979
-And you better be reading to her.
-I will.

1:19:37.105 --> 1:19:38.398
Okay, go ahead, then.

1:19:39.566 --> 1:19:44.279
My donkey, my donkey
has a heartache,

1:19:44.362 --> 1:19:46.364
the doctor gave him

1:19:46.448 --> 1:19:48.408
lemon drops!

1:19:48.492 --> 1:19:49.785
Lemon.

1:19:50.786 --> 1:19:51.912
Lemon drops. I gotta take a dump.

1:20:01.797 --> 1:20:04.591
Here. In case you run out of toilet paper.

1:20:04.674 --> 1:20:06.343
-Yeah.
-There you go.

1:20:09.763 --> 1:20:12.098
Hey, Jones, what does Judy King
look like naked?

1:20:12.891 --> 1:20:14.893
I don't care to talk about it.

1:20:17.604 --> 1:20:18.605
Come sit with us.

1:20:19.022 --> 1:20:21.358
We gotta be the refugee camp for noobs?

1:20:25.237 --> 1:20:28.365
I know how hard
it can be in the beginning.

1:20:31.117 --> 1:20:35.455
You really have to think
of your time here as a mandala.

1:20:37.249 --> 1:20:39.209
You know what a mandala is, honey?

1:20:42.754 --> 1:20:45.507
So, there are five different
love languages,

1:20:45.590 --> 1:20:47.634
but I don't really know what they are.

1:20:49.886 --> 1:20:52.848
God damn it, Ang!
It's too cold for this shit.

1:20:52.931 --> 1:20:55.600
What? It's funny.
Plus, you got great legs.

1:20:56.309 --> 1:20:57.936
-Oh, yeah.

1:20:58.019 --> 1:20:59.604
You have, like, Taylor Swift legs,

1:20:59.688 --> 1:21:02.566
except shorter and paler,
and not attached to Taylor Swift.

1:21:03.608 --> 1:21:05.277
Oh, thanks, Ang.

1:21:11.241 --> 1:21:12.158
Ready?

1:21:12.242 --> 1:21:14.244
Wait, I need the hand to go to 12.

1:21:15.245 --> 1:21:19.332
Okay, ready and go.

1:21:19.416 --> 1:21:20.876
All right!

1:21:20.959 --> 1:21:24.045
Hey! Asia girl. Wait up.

1:21:25.088 --> 1:21:27.090
You gotta stop calling me that.

1:21:27.173 --> 1:21:30.677
I know. I'm working on it, I swear.
I'm reading <i>Rising Out of Hatred.</i>

1:21:32.387 --> 1:21:35.724
So, I wrote you a haiku.

1:21:36.600 --> 1:21:39.519
That's a Jap... anese type of poem.

1:21:40.312 --> 1:21:41.479
I know.

1:21:46.109 --> 1:21:50.238
"I think I like you
In fact, I know I like you.

1:21:51.740 --> 1:21:53.033
I'm vulnerable."

1:21:57.037 --> 1:21:58.455
I can appreciate that.

1:22:02.792 --> 1:22:04.210
Thanks.

1:22:05.545 --> 1:22:06.588
Congratulations.

1:22:08.798 --> 1:22:10.133
I can't believe it.

1:22:12.052 --> 1:22:13.303
I'm a free woman.

1:22:15.722 --> 1:22:17.766
Patricia, thank you so much
for everything.

1:22:18.808 --> 1:22:20.393
A free woman with a green card.

1:22:20.477 --> 1:22:23.438
So go enjoy your life, Ms. Flores.
Good luck.

1:22:46.962 --> 1:22:48.630
I can't believe you're here.

1:22:48.713 --> 1:22:50.423
Why would you come
to the murder capital

1:22:50.507 --> 1:22:52.092
of the world to live in a shack?

1:22:52.175 --> 1:22:53.677
It's crazy!

1:22:54.302 --> 1:22:56.638
You're here. So I'm here too, baby.

1:22:59.015 --> 1:23:00.433
Let's get out of this
ugly airport

1:23:00.517 --> 1:23:02.560
so you can throw a dick
in me at your love shack.

1:23:02.644 --> 1:23:06.439
Mmm. Any dick or mine specifically?

1:23:07.816 --> 1:23:09.234
Take these.

1:23:10.110 --> 1:23:11.319
Come here.

1:23:12.654 --> 1:23:15.281
I hope you brought money
to bribe the gangs.

1:24:06.291 --> 1:24:09.127
Oh, you got it. Hit hard, yeah.

1:24:10.170 --> 1:24:12.338
Yeah. Yeah, harder. Harder.

1:24:15.300 --> 1:24:17.844
Since y'all are getting out
in the next few months,

1:24:17.927 --> 1:24:20.555
y'all are gonna be
the first microloans recipients

1:24:20.638 --> 1:24:23.058
from the Poussey Washington Fund!

1:24:23.391 --> 1:24:25.393
-Yes! That's what I'm talking about.

1:24:25.477 --> 1:24:29.522
Okay, listen, I can't have y'all
gettin' out and fuckin' it up.

1:24:29.606 --> 1:24:31.357
You gonna ruin it for everybody.

1:24:31.441 --> 1:24:35.361
So, you are going to learn
how to handle your finances.

1:24:35.445 --> 1:24:38.656
This is financial literacy,

1:24:38.740 --> 1:24:42.077
and this is gonna help you
get off the poverty bus.

1:24:42.535 --> 1:24:43.995
Or at least get you enough money

1:24:44.079 --> 1:24:46.539
so that you ain't gotta do
illegal shit no more, okay?

1:24:51.086 --> 1:24:53.213
<i>I've always loved getting clean. </i>

1:24:57.175 --> 1:24:59.010
<i>But now, when I say clean, </i>

1:25:00.345 --> 1:25:03.681
<i>I'm not talking about</i>
<i>baths and showers anymore. </i>

1:25:05.850 --> 1:25:08.269

1:25:15.652 --> 1:25:16.986

1:25:28.373 --> 1:25:30.250

1:25:36.464 --> 1:25:38.216

1:26:00.572 --> 1:26:02.157
So, this is it.

1:26:05.326 --> 1:26:07.328
The band is just broken up.

1:26:11.207 --> 1:26:12.458
Bye.

1:26:15.086 --> 1:26:17.297
