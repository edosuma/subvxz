00:05.773 --> 00:07.675
[Emily] Previously on
Make It Or Break It:

00:07.708 --> 00:08.976
What did you do?

00:09.009 --> 00:11.212
I took the training camp footage
of Payson kissing him,

00:11.245 --> 00:12.480
and I sent it to Ellen Beals.

00:12.513 --> 00:14.115
Now, I'm prepared
to make a commitment.

00:14.148 --> 00:16.584
To stay and coach you until you
are all on the World's Team.

00:16.617 --> 00:17.751
[all] Rock on!

00:17.785 --> 00:19.620
Gymnastics isn't the problem.

00:19.653 --> 00:20.754
I am.

00:21.689 --> 00:23.257
This next song
"Finally Free" was

00:23.291 --> 00:24.658
written with a friend of mine.

00:24.692 --> 00:26.594
What's going on
between you and Kaylie?

00:26.627 --> 00:27.761
But nothing is going on.

00:27.795 --> 00:29.697
We're done.

00:29.730 --> 00:32.566
We came across something
of concern with a test.

00:32.600 --> 00:35.736
- You're pregnant.
- [exhaling sharply]

00:40.341 --> 00:44.011
Well, it looks like
you're about 6 weeks.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.546
It doesn't look
like anything.

00:45.579 --> 00:47.148
It's just a sac at this point.

00:47.181 --> 00:48.682
[Emily] God, I can't believe it.

00:48.716 --> 00:50.584
How did this happen?

00:50.618 --> 00:52.486
Did you use protection?

00:53.654 --> 00:55.356
That's how it happened.

00:58.692 --> 01:00.461
I only had sex once.

01:00.494 --> 01:02.596
And I've only had one period
in my entire life,

01:02.630 --> 01:04.398
I didn't think...

01:04.432 --> 01:05.399
Emily.

01:05.433 --> 01:07.168
[doctor] We hear it all here.

01:07.201 --> 01:09.603
Girls who think they can't get
pregnant if they haven't had
a period,

01:09.637 --> 01:12.106
girls who think they can't get
pregnant if they have sex
during their period,

01:12.140 --> 01:14.575
and girls who think they can't
get pregnant if they have sex
standing up.

01:14.608 --> 01:18.646
The fact is, it is never safe
to have sex without protection.

01:18.679 --> 01:21.315
God, she only had her
first kiss last year!

01:21.349 --> 01:24.585
So, you're seventeen and you've
only had, what, one period ever?

01:24.618 --> 01:26.086
Did you ever check that out?

01:26.120 --> 01:27.821
She's an elite gymnast.

01:27.855 --> 01:29.723
She's on the,
National Team.

01:32.226 --> 01:36.464
Oh. Here is some literature
on your options.

01:38.332 --> 01:39.600
Options?

01:39.633 --> 01:43.704
Information on having
a baby and keeping it,

01:43.737 --> 01:45.706
giving it up for adoption.

01:45.739 --> 01:48.075
And information on
ending the pregnancy.

01:48.108 --> 01:50.711
But, what I need you to do now:

01:50.744 --> 01:54.515
is to increase your diet by
300 calories a day,

01:54.548 --> 01:56.650
make sure that you
limit your caffeine,

01:56.684 --> 01:59.487
and that you take a prenatal.

01:59.520 --> 02:01.255
No high impact exercise.

02:01.289 --> 02:04.825
And don't be surprised if you
experience exhaustion, aches,

02:04.858 --> 02:06.660
or nausea, because
it's all normal.

02:06.694 --> 02:11.265
But if you do have any cramps or
bleeding, I want you to call me.

02:11.299 --> 02:13.401
Good luck.

02:19.640 --> 02:21.909
[exhales sharply]

02:23.143 --> 02:24.645
[rock music plays]

02:24.678 --> 02:26.780
* No more doin' nothin'

02:26.814 --> 02:31.285
* I got something to prove

02:31.319 --> 02:34.688
* No more,
no more feeling useless *

02:34.722 --> 02:39.493
* I got nothin' to lose *

02:39.527 --> 02:40.494
Thank god you're here.

02:40.528 --> 02:43.731
This place will finally
get back to normal.

02:54.275 --> 02:56.710
What's going on here?

02:56.744 --> 02:58.546
You need to shut this down.

02:58.579 --> 02:59.580
Emily can't do this.

02:59.613 --> 03:01.582
Is that because Emily hasn't

03:01.615 --> 03:03.584
yet secured her place on the
team? Because...

03:03.617 --> 03:06.186
[whispering] No. It's not that.
She's not coming.

03:06.220 --> 03:08.489
And I don't like the idea of a
reporter sniffing around

03:08.522 --> 03:10.524
at such a sensitive time
for the girls.

03:10.558 --> 03:13.561
It's called publicity before the
biggest event of their careers.

03:13.594 --> 03:16.897
The girls need to get
their faces out there.

03:16.930 --> 03:18.666
Here I am!

03:23.304 --> 03:26.173
Here she is, Emily Kmetko,

03:26.206 --> 03:29.277
the third member from the mighty
Rock to qualify for Worlds,

03:29.310 --> 03:30.644
How are you feeling, Emily?

03:30.678 --> 03:33.314
Great. I'm feeling great.
Ready to go.

03:33.347 --> 03:35.749
Have you heard from the NGO
about your status on the World
Team?

03:35.783 --> 03:39.653
Um, no, I haven't been cleared.

03:39.687 --> 03:42.723
And your performance in Hungary
probably didn't do you any
favors.

03:42.756 --> 03:46.794
That's probably true.

03:48.929 --> 03:50.664
Anybody home?

03:50.698 --> 03:52.400
Hey.

03:52.433 --> 03:53.801
What gives, Smiley?

03:53.834 --> 03:54.902
Well, funny you should ask.

03:54.935 --> 03:57.305
So, you know the label,

03:57.338 --> 03:59.373
that loved me so much until they

03:59.407 --> 04:00.608
decided everything
I wrote was crap?

04:00.641 --> 04:02.710
They love your new songs!

04:02.743 --> 04:03.977
Not exactly.

04:04.011 --> 04:06.680
They did, however,
love one song.

04:06.714 --> 04:08.549
- That's a start, right?
- A big one.

04:08.582 --> 04:10.618
But not only did they love it,
they think it is fantastic.

04:10.651 --> 04:12.453
And they want it to be
my first single.

04:12.486 --> 04:13.787
That's amazing, Damon!

04:13.821 --> 04:15.656
It's the song that
we wrote together.

04:15.689 --> 04:19.527
- And they want us to record it.
- What?

04:19.560 --> 04:22.596
They flipped for the song and
the girl that I sang it with.

04:23.764 --> 04:26.700
Something about her
"heartbreakingly pure voice".

04:26.734 --> 04:30.270
- I don't believe this.
- Believe it, Kaylie Cruz.

04:30.304 --> 04:32.573
You are about to record a single
for a major label.

04:32.606 --> 04:34.508
And I think we should start
working on new songs right
away.

04:34.542 --> 04:36.444
We have something hot going.

04:36.477 --> 04:39.813
- As a duo. Musically.
- Yeah.

04:43.451 --> 04:46.420
So Emily, your critics point to
a wildly inconsistent career.

04:46.454 --> 04:49.990
You barely got the last spot
on the National Team, you've had
legal troubles,

04:50.023 --> 04:52.560
you were benched in France and
you all but choked in Hungary.

04:52.593 --> 04:55.429
How can you honestly say you
deserve to go to the
Championships

04:55.463 --> 04:59.600
of the entire World, in the
place of, say, former National
Champ Kelly Parker?

04:59.633 --> 05:03.504
Um, well, I wouldn't say I
deserve it more, but

05:03.537 --> 05:04.805
I would.

05:04.838 --> 05:06.940
Emily earned a spot at
World Team Trials.

05:06.974 --> 05:08.976
Kelly Parker didn't.
End of story.

05:09.009 --> 05:12.846
But you have to agree, Emily,
it will be a highly
controversial decision.

05:12.880 --> 05:15.483
If your very vocal fans here
can secure your spot,

05:15.516 --> 05:17.951
the pressure will be on you
to prove that this time,

05:17.985 --> 05:18.986
you deserve it.

05:19.019 --> 05:20.921
Yes. Yes it will.

05:20.954 --> 05:21.989
But I can do it.

05:22.022 --> 05:23.857
[reporter] Well, that's it
from Boulder.

05:23.891 --> 05:25.826
The three elite gymnasts from
the legendary

05:25.859 --> 05:27.595
Rocky Mountain Gymnastic
Training Center.

05:27.628 --> 05:29.363
Look for them competing
for the USA

05:29.397 --> 05:31.331
in the upcoming World
Championships in Rio.

05:31.365 --> 05:33.333
This could be their year.

05:33.367 --> 05:34.535
Back to training!

05:34.568 --> 05:37.371
Emily? Can I have a word?
My office.

05:37.405 --> 05:40.007
- Ladies, thank you.
- Thank you.

05:46.647 --> 05:48.782
You told the reporter
you're ready for Worlds.

05:48.816 --> 05:50.518
Yup.

05:50.551 --> 05:53.421
So you've made some decisions.

05:53.454 --> 05:54.488
About what?

05:54.522 --> 05:57.858
About your pregnancy.

05:57.891 --> 05:58.992
Did you see a doctor?

05:59.026 --> 06:01.094
[inhales] This morning.

06:01.128 --> 06:04.331
She said I'm only six weeks so I
still have some time to figure
things out.

06:04.364 --> 06:06.534
Emily, you don't have time.

06:06.567 --> 06:09.437
Worlds are around the corner
and you need to train your ass
off to get ready.

06:09.470 --> 06:11.805
Which you can't do
if you're pregnant.

06:11.839 --> 06:14.508
I can't tell you what to do.
This decision is yours.

06:14.542 --> 06:16.544
But you've got to make it. Now.

06:16.577 --> 06:18.446
And I will make it.

06:18.479 --> 06:20.848
When I find out for sure if I'm
even going to Worlds,

06:20.881 --> 06:22.416
whenever that is.

06:22.450 --> 06:23.884
[inhaling sharply]
Can I go?

06:31.559 --> 06:35.062
[theme music playing]

06:55.849 --> 07:01.655
* If I wanna cry
I'll cry *

07:01.689 --> 07:05.593
* You will see the tears
in my eyes *

07:05.626 --> 07:10.063
* If I wanna leave
I'll go *

07:10.097 --> 07:13.534
* If I am hurting now
you'll know *

07:13.567 --> 07:15.402
* You'll know *

07:15.435 --> 07:16.737
- That's great.
- Thank you.

07:16.770 --> 07:18.706
You think I'm doing
you a favor here?

07:18.739 --> 07:21.542
Your instincts are amazing.
You're helping finish my album.

07:21.575 --> 07:24.411
[chuckling] And you're
helping me realize

07:24.444 --> 07:27.681
that maybe I could do
something else with my life.

07:27.715 --> 07:29.082
Other than gymnastics.

07:29.116 --> 07:32.185
It's amazing to feel
excited about something

07:32.219 --> 07:33.921
besides a Double Arabian.

07:33.954 --> 07:36.156
That's not the
two-headed horse is it?

07:36.189 --> 07:38.125
That belongs in a
Pink Floyd song,

07:38.158 --> 07:39.459
not our little duet here.

07:39.493 --> 07:42.029
[chuckling] No, It's one of the
moves I thought I had to

07:42.062 --> 07:43.831
starve myself to land.

07:43.864 --> 07:47.067
All my self-worth was
wrapped up in gymnastics.

07:47.100 --> 07:49.637
Not anymore.

07:49.670 --> 07:51.739
And it's just such a relief

07:51.772 --> 07:54.875
to not feel like I have to be
perfect at that one thing.

07:54.908 --> 07:58.111
Perfect is boring.

07:58.145 --> 08:00.113
It's not what being
an artist is all about.

08:00.147 --> 08:01.081
I am not an artist.

08:01.114 --> 08:03.884
Yes. Yes, you are.

08:03.917 --> 08:05.686
You're not only
inspiring these songs,

08:05.719 --> 08:07.855
you're creating them with me.

08:07.888 --> 08:11.559
I was totally blocked until you
rescued me and this album.

08:11.592 --> 08:14.962
I didn't think I'd ever write
another great song without...

08:14.995 --> 08:16.830
Emily?

08:16.864 --> 08:20.067
Are you sure it's over
between you two?

08:20.100 --> 08:23.103
She loves you and you love her.

08:23.136 --> 08:24.905
That doesn't mean we're
right for each other.

08:24.938 --> 08:28.108
Sometimes I think the only thing
our pain.ad in common was

08:28.141 --> 08:30.644
Love shouldn't have
to be so hard.

08:30.678 --> 08:35.215
If two people just click.

08:37.651 --> 08:40.688
[stammering] I think we
should probably finish.

08:40.721 --> 08:42.189
Yeah.

08:43.123 --> 08:44.091
Yeah, where were we?

08:44.124 --> 08:46.026
Let's do the chorus again.

08:46.059 --> 08:48.128
[guitar chords play]

08:53.000 --> 08:54.501
[Lauren clearing throat]

08:54.534 --> 08:56.970
Must be weird for you to have
Summer's old boyfriend back.

08:57.004 --> 08:59.106
No weirder than it is for you.

08:59.139 --> 09:02.009
After all, you almost
ruined his career.

09:02.042 --> 09:06.246
You must feel real
comfortable having him back.

09:06.279 --> 09:08.215
Well, I'm pretty sure
I'm not alone

09:08.248 --> 09:09.783
when I say I don't
trust him.

09:09.817 --> 09:11.218
I mean look at this!

09:11.251 --> 09:13.987
[scoffs] Um, hello, she's taken!

09:14.021 --> 09:15.589
[whispering] Stop that!

09:15.623 --> 09:17.057
If you like it you gotta
put a ring on it.

09:19.593 --> 09:21.895
[scoffs] Ask Summer
to marry you, Daddy.

09:21.929 --> 09:23.797
And you can't give her the
same ring you gave her before.

09:23.831 --> 09:25.766
- Why not?
- It's tainted.

09:25.799 --> 09:28.068
And besides, the second time
around, it has to be bigger.

09:28.101 --> 09:30.704
And better. With a proposal
she cannot refuse.

09:35.075 --> 09:36.543
I think you're right.

09:36.576 --> 09:38.545
Of course I am.
And I already have it
picked out.

09:38.578 --> 09:39.880
We can get it this
afternoon.

09:39.913 --> 09:41.014
[exclaiming] I can't wait!

09:47.320 --> 09:50.691
Emily. Please. Can we talk?

09:51.892 --> 09:53.593
Nothing to talk about.

09:53.627 --> 09:57.030
[sighing] Please, talk to me
about this, Emily.

09:57.064 --> 09:59.232
I understand.
I was a pregnant teenager too.

09:59.266 --> 10:00.834
Fantastic.

10:00.868 --> 10:03.103
[inhaling] After fighting it
my entire life,

10:03.136 --> 10:04.371
I ended up exactly like you.

10:07.107 --> 10:10.010
You know, I've been
reading all the literature,

10:10.043 --> 10:12.212
and it's actually quite common,

10:12.245 --> 10:13.613
that when your mother was a
pregnant teen...

10:13.647 --> 10:15.148
Do not quote
"the literature" to me.

10:15.182 --> 10:18.085
I'm not a statistic.

10:19.853 --> 10:22.322
Did you talk to Sasha?

10:22.355 --> 10:23.691
Yup.

10:23.724 --> 10:26.359
Did he give you advice?

10:26.393 --> 10:28.195
Nope, he just said that I
had to make a decision.

10:28.228 --> 10:31.131
Honey, you know you have to.
You can't pretend this isn't
happening.

10:31.164 --> 10:33.100
I'm not! It's just every time
I think about it,

10:33.133 --> 10:34.201
my head wants to explode.

10:34.234 --> 10:37.304
Okay, well then let's work
through it, piece by piece,

10:37.337 --> 10:39.807
we'll figure it out.

10:41.074 --> 10:47.047
[gasping] Do you have a problem
with ending this pregnancy?

10:48.982 --> 10:50.317
Do you?

10:50.350 --> 10:52.052
No. Why would I?

10:52.085 --> 10:54.922
Because you were in my position.
And you had me.

10:54.955 --> 11:02.062
And you are the most
wonderful gift in my life.

11:02.095 --> 11:04.164
I am so lucky to have you.

11:04.197 --> 11:05.933
You're my reason for being.

11:05.966 --> 11:10.337
But I want differently for you.

11:13.106 --> 11:16.777
[sighing] Well then,
why did you have me?

11:16.810 --> 11:20.981
[sobbing] At the time, I didn't
think I had a choice.

11:25.018 --> 11:29.923
- [scoffs] And I do?
- Of course you do.

11:29.957 --> 11:32.926
Honey, ending a pregnancy

11:32.960 --> 11:38.031
is totally legal at this stage.
It's pretty common.

11:38.065 --> 11:40.000
But is it okay?

11:40.901 --> 11:44.037
Do you mean if it's wrong?

11:44.071 --> 11:47.908
Well some people think that...

11:47.941 --> 11:51.812
...the soul enters the body
when you're born,

11:51.845 --> 11:52.980
some people think that...

11:53.013 --> 11:57.084
...it's when you have sex,
or you conceive,

11:57.117 --> 12:00.687
and some people think that it's
when the baby has its first
heartbeat.

12:00.720 --> 12:03.356
And some people don't
believe in souls.

12:03.390 --> 12:06.459
I just think that it's

12:06.493 --> 12:11.932
bigger than any
of us can realize.

12:11.965 --> 12:14.101
Do you think it's wrong?

12:18.338 --> 12:21.208
Well then honey,
what's the problem?

12:21.241 --> 12:24.978
Is it Damon?
Have you told him?

12:27.147 --> 12:28.748
You don't have to tell him.

12:28.782 --> 12:31.184
It's your choice.

12:31.218 --> 12:33.386
You guys aren't even
together anymore.

12:33.420 --> 12:36.824
[sighing] I'm fully
aware of that, Mom.

12:36.857 --> 12:38.892
And I have stuff to do.

12:38.926 --> 12:41.028
Can we not talk about
this right now?

12:44.965 --> 12:47.734
* If you wanna be goofy

12:47.767 --> 12:49.769
* Go right ahead

12:49.803 --> 12:52.973
* It's fine with me

12:55.075 --> 12:57.044
* If you wanna do something

12:57.077 --> 13:00.213
"Of all the seasons,
the best is Summer."

13:00.247 --> 13:03.116
* By all means, please

13:03.150 --> 13:06.920
"Without you,
life is a bummer."

13:06.954 --> 13:09.389
[chuckling]

13:09.422 --> 13:12.492
* You see, we have a choice

13:12.525 --> 13:14.895
"You bring us Sun...

13:16.063 --> 13:18.999
...It's plain to see."

13:21.434 --> 13:23.403
Can we please be a family?

13:23.436 --> 13:24.838
- [gasping]
- [Steve] Here.

13:24.872 --> 13:30.310
[clearing throat]
Summer Van Horn,

13:32.045 --> 13:33.080
will you marry me?

13:34.514 --> 13:35.983
Oh, wow.

13:36.016 --> 13:37.417
[Lauren] I knew you'd love it,
when I saw it I thought

13:37.450 --> 13:38.418
this is it!

13:38.451 --> 13:39.953
The wedding is gonna be epic!

13:39.987 --> 13:42.956
[Steve] Lauren, give her a
chance to say "yes" first.

13:42.990 --> 13:44.925
So, what do you say?

13:44.958 --> 13:47.194
Ready to make an honest man
out of me?

13:52.900 --> 13:53.934
I need to think about it.

13:55.135 --> 13:57.270
[stammering] Right.

13:57.304 --> 13:59.406
[Steve] Sure.

14:15.522 --> 14:19.059
- She's still not dealing
with it.
- The clock is ticking.

14:19.092 --> 14:22.595
Do you think there's any chance
she could have the baby, and
come back?

14:22.629 --> 14:24.531
No. That is absolutely
not an option.

14:24.564 --> 14:27.434
Elite gymnasts' bodies are
almost artificially small.

14:27.467 --> 14:29.937
Pregnancy changes that forever.

14:29.970 --> 14:32.072
Chloe, one of Emily's
big challenges is her

14:32.105 --> 14:34.507
"have her cake and eat it too"
mentality.

14:34.541 --> 14:37.945
She had a job and didn't tell
me, she was seeing a boy,
against the rules.

14:37.978 --> 14:39.112
Didn't tell me.

14:39.146 --> 14:41.915
She thinks she can have it
her way, every time.

14:41.949 --> 14:43.917
This time she can't.

14:43.951 --> 14:46.219
- I wish you would talk to her.
- I did.

14:46.253 --> 14:49.056
No, I want you to
give her some advice.

14:49.089 --> 14:51.291
She looks up to you. Your
opinion would mean a lot to her.

14:51.324 --> 14:52.892
I don't have an opinion.

14:52.926 --> 14:54.394
- You don't have an opinion?
- No.

14:54.427 --> 14:58.031
Frankly Chloe, I wonder whether
Emily has the mettle to go all
the way.

14:58.065 --> 15:01.234
This is her decision. And her
decision will show me a lot.

15:01.268 --> 15:04.437
Well, thanks a lot, Coach.
This isn't some test!

15:04.471 --> 15:06.639
This is my daughter's life!
I guess I'll just...

15:06.673 --> 15:08.475
...go somewhere else
to find some help.

15:11.945 --> 15:15.048
And now Damon's label, the one
that produced his first single,

15:15.082 --> 15:17.317
they want us to record
the song we wrote.

15:17.350 --> 15:18.885
I wrote a song, Gene.

15:18.918 --> 15:20.920
[Gene] So, it strikes you as odd

15:20.954 --> 15:25.325
that you were good enough to do
something besides gymnastics?

15:25.358 --> 15:29.129
It strikes me as odd that anyone
cares about what's really inside
me.

15:29.162 --> 15:31.898
What did you think
would happen if you

15:31.931 --> 15:34.334
expressed negative feelings?

15:34.367 --> 15:36.203
I thought I'd be...

15:38.038 --> 15:40.307
...deserted.

15:40.340 --> 15:44.144
But, you put your real feelings
into a song,

15:44.177 --> 15:46.346
and what happened?

15:46.379 --> 15:47.514
They loved it.

15:47.547 --> 15:51.284
It may be time.

15:51.318 --> 15:52.952
Time for what?

15:52.986 --> 15:56.656
Time for you to get back in the
gym and return to gymnastics,

15:56.689 --> 15:59.092
if that's what you choose.

15:59.126 --> 16:02.495
You are in your
target weight range,

16:02.529 --> 16:05.932
and healthy enough
to start training again.

16:05.965 --> 16:08.635
Congratulations.

16:17.510 --> 16:21.348
I thought your routine ended
with a front layout, not a full
twist.

16:21.381 --> 16:24.284
So did I. I dunno
where that came from.

16:36.763 --> 16:38.531
[groaning] Ah, damn it!

16:38.565 --> 16:40.433
[Sasha] You have what is known
as the "twisties".

16:40.467 --> 16:41.734
It's actually quite common
in gymnastics.

16:41.768 --> 16:44.237
Your body compels you to add a
twist almost against your will.

16:44.271 --> 16:46.005
My body never compels
me to do anything.

16:46.039 --> 16:48.175
You're right. It's actually
a psychological affliction.

16:48.208 --> 16:53.113
But just like any mental quirk,
it can be difficult to overcome.

16:53.146 --> 16:56.683
Is there anything in particular
that's weighing on your mind?

16:58.318 --> 16:59.452
Alright then.

16:59.486 --> 17:01.421
You need to come into the gym
early every day

17:01.454 --> 17:03.556
so you and I can work
on getting over this.

17:03.590 --> 17:05.658
You want me to work with you?

17:05.692 --> 17:07.327
Here? Alone?

17:07.360 --> 17:09.762
Lauren, you need to know that
nothing inappropriate

17:09.796 --> 17:11.398
happened between Payson and me.

17:11.431 --> 17:13.500
You have my absolute word.

17:13.533 --> 17:15.702
I'll see you in the morning.

17:23.810 --> 17:26.746
- Is it weird for you having him
back?
- A little.

17:26.779 --> 17:29.616
You look like you have more than
just "a little" on your mind.

17:29.649 --> 17:31.784
You're color coding your pens.

17:34.287 --> 17:35.722
Steve asked me to marry him.

17:35.755 --> 17:37.457
What did you say?

17:37.490 --> 17:40.627
- I haven't said anything yet.
- Why not?

17:40.660 --> 17:42.162
I'm not sure.

17:42.195 --> 17:43.563
Lauren needs a mother,

17:43.596 --> 17:47.734
and I know it's supposed to be
me, I can feel it in my bones.

17:47.767 --> 17:49.402
And Steve has changed.

17:49.436 --> 17:51.704
He's really trying hard
to be a better man.

17:51.738 --> 17:53.373
So, what's the problem?

17:53.406 --> 17:58.044
There isn't any chance you still
have feelings for someone else?

17:58.077 --> 18:01.714
Even if I did still
have feelings for Sasha,

18:01.748 --> 18:03.583
he doesn't share my values.

18:03.616 --> 18:07.287
That's because he doesn't know
you're considering marrying
someone else.

18:07.320 --> 18:09.622
I think you need to
try one more time.

18:09.656 --> 18:12.725
Just lay it all out there.
See if he can go there with you.

18:26.539 --> 18:28.708
Wow. That was perfect.

18:28.741 --> 18:33.213
Does it ever feel like your
broken back was just a tiny blip
on your way to the Olympics?

18:33.246 --> 18:35.682
Tiny blip? Not quite.

18:35.715 --> 18:37.517
It was the biggest
test of my life.

18:37.550 --> 18:42.655
Well, whatever, you're peaking
at the best possible time for
Worlds.

18:42.689 --> 18:43.856
Thanks.
You'll be at Worlds, too.

18:43.890 --> 18:46.793
They still haven't
made a decision yet.

18:46.826 --> 18:47.794
You're going.

18:47.827 --> 18:49.729
I'm not going without you.

18:49.762 --> 18:51.231
Do you want me to spot you?

18:51.264 --> 18:53.466
[stammering] No,
I can't do the bars.

18:53.500 --> 18:57.237
I'm just not feeling
very good. Today.

18:57.270 --> 18:58.638
Emily!

19:01.608 --> 19:03.576
I have some good news.

19:05.778 --> 19:10.383
You have been officially
reinstated on the US World
team.

19:11.518 --> 19:13.286
Young lady,
you are going to Rio!

19:13.320 --> 19:16.789
See? What did I tell you?

19:46.653 --> 19:49.422
I'm just going to say it.
You're scaring me a little here.

19:49.456 --> 19:55.161
[sighing] I'm "with child".

19:55.194 --> 19:56.296
Not funny.

19:58.565 --> 20:00.467
[sobbing] Yeah,
you're telling me.

20:00.500 --> 20:04.437
God, Emily.

20:04.471 --> 20:06.939
How could you do this?

20:06.973 --> 20:09.542
You're not stupid.
You know you can't just...

20:09.576 --> 20:12.479
How many times did somebody
tell you, "no boyfriends"?

20:12.512 --> 20:15.348
This is why, Emily!
This is what happens!

20:15.382 --> 20:17.717
Yeah, I forgot.
You're perfect.

20:17.750 --> 20:19.185
Thanks for the support.

20:19.218 --> 20:22.555
No. No you don't.
I'm not the bad guy here.

20:22.589 --> 20:24.591
I didn't break the rules.
I didn't get knocked up.

20:24.624 --> 20:28.395
So don't try to make me feel bad
because I won't tell you it's
okay.

20:28.428 --> 20:29.896
You screwed up.

20:29.929 --> 20:33.400
Because you can never, ever
seem to take gymnastics
seriously.

20:33.433 --> 20:36.603
[sobbing]
I just need a friend.

20:45.845 --> 20:49.682
The best way I know to be a
friend is to support your
gymnastics.

20:49.716 --> 20:51.784
Your mom, Sasha, Marcus...

20:51.818 --> 20:56.356
Everyone keeps giving you
chance after chance because

20:56.389 --> 20:58.825
they believe in you, and
they know you can be great...

20:58.858 --> 21:00.427
But I don't.

21:00.460 --> 21:03.262
I don't believe it.

21:03.296 --> 21:05.365
The truth is, I am not special.

21:05.398 --> 21:08.835
And to be an Olympian you have
to be a one in a billion
athlete.

21:08.868 --> 21:10.703
- You have to be special.
- You are.

21:10.737 --> 21:12.405
[Emily sobbing] I'm not.

21:12.439 --> 21:14.641
I'm not as good
as everybody thinks I am.

21:14.674 --> 21:16.843
Emily, you just made
the World Team.

21:16.876 --> 21:18.778
Because of more
"special chances".

21:18.811 --> 21:22.281
I don't want people to support
me because they think that

21:22.315 --> 21:24.984
I could become
something or someone.

21:25.017 --> 21:28.355
God, the pressure is
killing me.

21:28.388 --> 21:30.923
I know it's hard,
I know it's hard,

21:30.957 --> 21:35.695
but you've got to stay
mentally tough here.

21:35.728 --> 21:38.465
You know, maybe this is just
a sign from the universe,

21:38.498 --> 21:40.833
maybe...

21:40.867 --> 21:43.269
[sighing] ...maybe this is just
gonna be an easier path for me.

21:43.302 --> 21:45.004
Maybe I should just
have this baby...

21:45.037 --> 21:46.839
You can't honestly believe that

21:46.873 --> 21:50.777
having a baby and raising it
alone and being a teen mom

21:50.810 --> 21:53.480
is "the easier path" here.

21:53.513 --> 21:57.350
Please tell me you're
not that crazy.

21:57.384 --> 21:59.552
[sobbing] I don't know
what I am right now.

22:00.453 --> 22:02.489
Come here, it's fine.

22:07.927 --> 22:10.730
All quiet on the
gymnastics front.

22:10.763 --> 22:12.732
I think I'm going to head home.

22:12.765 --> 22:15.468
Maybe you can finally have
that conversation with Sasha.

22:15.502 --> 22:18.405
Alone.
You have to try.

22:19.506 --> 22:21.774
- Night, guys.
- Good night.

22:23.910 --> 22:25.044
Long day?

22:29.348 --> 22:30.483
Is everything okay?

22:31.451 --> 22:34.353
Are you happy you came back
to The Rock?

22:34.387 --> 22:37.624
I'm happy to see
the things I've missed.

22:40.660 --> 22:44.664
Summer, you've always been
somebody I could confide in,

22:44.697 --> 22:48.100
and I know you'll be discreet.

22:48.134 --> 22:51.538
I've just never had to deal with
a situation like this before.

22:51.571 --> 22:52.872
Sasha, what's wrong?

22:52.905 --> 22:55.742
Emily Kmetko is pregnant.

22:55.775 --> 22:59.646
[sighing] Oh my.
Poor thing.

22:59.679 --> 23:01.414
Why is she still training?

23:01.448 --> 23:02.782
What have you told her?

23:02.815 --> 23:03.983
Nothing.

23:04.016 --> 23:06.653
- I'm staying out of it.
- She's a teenage girl.

23:06.686 --> 23:09.922
She needs your guidance, however
difficult that might be for you.

23:09.956 --> 23:13.426
You have to tell her that
she has our love and support,

23:13.460 --> 23:18.097
and that everything will be okay
when she has the baby.

23:18.130 --> 23:20.667
- I can't tell her that.
- Why not?

23:20.700 --> 23:22.969
Because I don't
want her to have the baby.

23:23.002 --> 23:25.438
I want her to go to Worlds,
and the Olympics.

23:25.472 --> 23:27.106
I want her to get medals and
endorsements

23:27.139 --> 23:29.609
and get her family out of the
dank corridor they live in.

23:29.642 --> 23:32.745
I want her to get college
scholarships and make something
of her life.

23:32.779 --> 23:34.981
So, no, Summer, it's not
going to be "okay".

23:35.014 --> 23:37.650
This mistake will end
her entire career.

23:37.684 --> 23:38.951
It's already over.

23:38.985 --> 23:41.788
It ended the day she
had sex and got pregnant.

23:41.821 --> 23:43.422
That's the day it ended.

23:43.456 --> 23:46.058
And this child
is a human being, Sasha.

23:46.092 --> 23:50.162
It's not some game piece you can
just move around to help Emily's
career.

23:50.196 --> 23:53.399
And having a baby
won't end her life.

23:53.432 --> 23:54.734
It will end the one
I want for her.

23:56.168 --> 23:59.105
Look I respect your very
strong opinion on this issue.

23:59.138 --> 24:02.842
But I also hope that you
can understand mine.

24:02.875 --> 24:04.744
I'm sorry. I can't.

24:04.777 --> 24:07.079
And I won't.

24:09.849 --> 24:14.420
* I choose happiness
I choose peace *

24:14.453 --> 24:16.689
* I choose beauty...

24:16.723 --> 24:17.924
[doorbell rings]

24:19.492 --> 24:24.531
* I choose grace
I choose joy *

24:24.564 --> 24:29.001
* I choose life
and love, love, love, love *

24:29.035 --> 24:30.202
Yes.

24:33.239 --> 24:35.141
[Kaylie singing]
* I'm done holding back

24:35.174 --> 24:37.610
* I dropped the act

24:37.644 --> 24:41.814
* I was keeping it
together for too long *

24:41.848 --> 24:43.816
* I'm through running scared

24:43.850 --> 24:46.018
* From what's in there

24:46.052 --> 24:50.557
* It's not perfect,
but it's me *

24:50.590 --> 24:55.061
* If I wanna cry,
I'll cry *

24:55.094 --> 24:58.765
* You will see the
tears in my eyes *

24:58.798 --> 25:02.669
* If I wanna leave,
I'll go *

25:02.702 --> 25:07.774
* If I am hurting now
you'll know, you'll know *

25:09.876 --> 25:13.045
* You'll know *

25:13.079 --> 25:15.915
That's it. That was the take.

25:15.948 --> 25:17.850
Let's listen to the
last chorus, okay?

25:17.884 --> 25:19.051
* I try

25:19.085 --> 25:23.155
* I was dying
just to live a lie *

25:23.189 --> 25:27.660
* Hopelessly floating
like a bird *

25:27.694 --> 25:31.598
* I was running out
of air too soon *

25:31.631 --> 25:36.002
* If we are honest
we can be honest *

25:36.035 --> 25:38.037
* I can be happy

25:38.070 --> 25:41.540
* And I can be going
on for me *

25:41.574 --> 25:44.944
* If I wanna cry
I'll cry *

25:44.977 --> 25:48.881
* You will see the
tears in my eyes *

25:48.915 --> 25:53.119
* If I wanna leave
I'll go *

25:53.152 --> 25:57.990
* If I am hurting now
you'll know, you'll know *

25:59.091 --> 26:02.561
* You'll know *

26:09.168 --> 26:12.872
We can't do this.
I'm sorry, It's wrong.

26:12.905 --> 26:15.241
It doesn't feel wrong.

26:15.274 --> 26:16.643
It feels...

26:16.676 --> 26:18.745
You know how it feels.
Don't pretend you don't.

26:18.778 --> 26:20.613
Look, it's okay.
Emily and I are broken up.

26:20.647 --> 26:22.081
No, it's not okay.

26:22.114 --> 26:27.053
She's still my friend, Damon.
And I'm not going to hurt her.

26:32.224 --> 26:36.295
What is that smell?
I'm going to hurl.

26:36.328 --> 26:38.998
Is it this? No?

26:39.031 --> 26:40.700
This?

26:40.733 --> 26:42.168
- [sniffs, gags]
- Oh!

26:42.201 --> 26:45.938
Look, there.
All gone.

26:47.807 --> 26:50.810
Thanks for this, Mom.

26:55.815 --> 26:59.151
Honey, I want you to know
that I'm here for you.

26:59.185 --> 27:00.753
100 percent.

27:00.787 --> 27:04.290
You take as much time
as you need to

27:04.323 --> 27:06.258
make whatever
decision you want.

27:06.292 --> 27:09.095
Your mama's here.

27:15.134 --> 27:18.070
- [door shuts]
- [knocking on door]

27:20.139 --> 27:21.240
Thank you for coming.

27:21.273 --> 27:23.910
Thank you for confiding in me.

27:23.943 --> 27:27.914
I know Emily thinks we're all
monsters at the NGO

27:27.947 --> 27:29.115
but I really want to help.

27:30.783 --> 27:33.119
[Emily] What's he doing here?

27:33.152 --> 27:37.023
It's okay, Emily. Your mom did
the right thing by calling me.

27:37.056 --> 27:39.992
You told the NGO?

27:40.026 --> 27:41.260
They want to ruin my life.

27:41.293 --> 27:44.897
Emily, I've been
through this before.

27:44.931 --> 27:49.902
Another gymnast got pregnant?
What happened?

27:49.936 --> 27:53.072
We took care of it,

27:53.105 --> 27:56.242
and she went on to make the
National Team that year.

27:56.275 --> 28:01.213
Look, at this point, it's a
lot more emotionally draining
than it is physically draining.

28:01.247 --> 28:03.349
You can have the procedure
on a Friday,

28:03.382 --> 28:05.051
be back training on a Monday.

28:05.084 --> 28:09.088
I am so sick of you people
controlling everything I do!

28:09.121 --> 28:11.023
Who I can see, where I can go.

28:11.057 --> 28:13.860
And now you want
to control this?

28:13.893 --> 28:15.227
Well guess what?

28:15.261 --> 28:17.764
You can't.

28:17.797 --> 28:20.299
I get to decide what
I do with my body!

28:20.332 --> 28:23.702
You cannot make me do anything.
I have a choice!

28:23.736 --> 28:27.740
Emily, please,
I'm here to help.

28:27.774 --> 28:29.976
I've grown really close
to you and your mother...

28:30.009 --> 28:32.278
What's that supposed to mean?

28:32.311 --> 28:33.913
What's going on between you two?

28:33.946 --> 28:35.681
- Nothing, nothing.
- Nothing.

28:35.714 --> 28:39.018
And why did I get to go to
Worlds when I choked in Hungary?

28:39.051 --> 28:40.787
Well, I fought for you,
Emily, I did...

28:40.820 --> 28:42.955
...because I wanted you
to have another chance.

28:42.989 --> 28:44.824
[Emily] Do you know what
your chances feel like?

28:44.857 --> 28:46.893
Like lead around my neck.

28:46.926 --> 28:49.896
Like a constant reminder that
I am not good enough.

28:49.929 --> 28:52.198
Emily, you're hormonal,
okay, just calm down.

28:52.231 --> 28:53.966
No! I won't!

28:54.000 --> 28:58.004
Nobody understands!

28:58.037 --> 28:59.138
You know what, Damon will.

28:59.171 --> 29:01.473
Damon will understand.

29:01.507 --> 29:02.942
And he will be there for me.

29:02.975 --> 29:04.476
Honey, we are here for you.

29:04.510 --> 29:06.112
We are.

29:06.145 --> 29:09.849
And I read that 80 percent of
teen fathers leave after the
first year.

29:09.882 --> 29:11.784
[Emily] Enough with
the literature!

29:11.818 --> 29:15.121
That is not my baby's father.

29:15.154 --> 29:17.223
That is not Damon!

29:19.425 --> 29:21.193
He loves me.

29:21.227 --> 29:22.328
He'll take care of me.

29:37.376 --> 29:38.978
How long do I have to do these?

29:39.011 --> 29:40.379
You're relearning the move in
pieces.

29:40.412 --> 29:42.414
So your body doesn't have a
chance to add a twist.

29:42.448 --> 29:43.950
Go again.

29:51.223 --> 29:53.993
The "twisties" are about
convincing your mind

29:54.026 --> 29:56.062
that your body is
completely safe.

29:56.095 --> 29:57.830
Are you convinced you're safe?

29:59.065 --> 30:01.500
All right now, show me.

30:20.386 --> 30:25.858
Excellent! That is the quickest
turnaround of the "twisties"
I've...

30:25.892 --> 30:30.930
What's wrong?
Are you hurt?

30:30.963 --> 30:33.065
[sobbing]
No, it's not that.

30:33.099 --> 30:35.001
Not at all.

30:35.034 --> 30:38.504
It's just... you really
cared about helping me.

30:38.537 --> 30:40.839
Of course I did. I'm your coach

30:40.873 --> 30:42.574
and you are an extraordinary
gymnast, Lauren.

30:42.608 --> 30:46.578
Capable of truly winning it all.
I've always been here for you.

30:48.080 --> 30:50.816
I didn't think you noticed me.

30:50.849 --> 30:55.221
I thought you only saw me as
less than Payson and Kaylie.

30:55.254 --> 30:56.923
Even Emily.

30:56.956 --> 31:00.259
And here I always felt a bit
shut out when it came to you.

31:00.292 --> 31:02.594
I never thought you
were willing to let me in.

31:02.628 --> 31:05.597
Looks like we were
both wrong, huh?

31:05.631 --> 31:09.535
You and I are a team,
from here on out.

31:11.170 --> 31:13.639
[strumming Finally Free]

31:17.376 --> 31:19.045
[knock on door]

31:25.884 --> 31:28.887
Emily, what are you doing here?
You broke up with me, remember?

31:28.921 --> 31:30.422
And I'm tired of the
push-pull...

31:30.456 --> 31:33.492
When you said you'd wait for me
until 2012, did you mean it?

31:33.525 --> 31:35.894
Did you mean that
you'd love me till then?

31:35.928 --> 31:37.563
How many times are we
going to go through this?

31:37.596 --> 31:40.532
- Please! Just answer me.
- Yes, yes, I meant it.

31:40.566 --> 31:42.534
I thought that we would...

31:42.568 --> 31:45.537
...I thought we'd be
together forever.

31:45.571 --> 31:46.905
What if forever can be now?

31:46.939 --> 31:49.041
What if we don't have to wait
until Worlds or the Olympics

31:49.075 --> 31:52.178
or for the NGO to stop
controlling my life to have our
dream?

31:52.211 --> 31:53.545
What are you talking about?

31:53.579 --> 31:55.881
I'm pregnant.

31:55.914 --> 31:57.916
We don't have to wait
to have our happy ending.

31:57.950 --> 31:59.618
We can just be
together right now.

31:59.651 --> 32:02.054
We can have this baby,
we can have a family,

32:02.088 --> 32:04.456
and I can come on tour with you.

32:04.490 --> 32:05.691
What's the matter?

32:07.293 --> 32:09.528
Don't you want to be happy?

32:12.664 --> 32:13.932
And what about your dream?

32:13.966 --> 32:15.434
All that you've worked for?

32:15.467 --> 32:18.370
- We both had dreams...
- My dream is killing me,

32:18.404 --> 32:19.905
and this is my way out.

32:19.938 --> 32:21.640
I'm telling you,
all I feel is relief!

32:21.673 --> 32:24.110
I'm so excited to finally
start my life with you

32:24.143 --> 32:25.511
and do everything
that we planned.

32:25.544 --> 32:26.979
This is going to be great!

32:27.013 --> 32:31.283
I'm going to go home right now,
and I'm gonna pack.

32:31.317 --> 32:33.052
I'm going to move in
with you, okay?

32:33.085 --> 32:34.453
I need you, Damon.

32:34.486 --> 32:35.621
This is going to be great.

32:35.654 --> 32:38.590
It's exactly what I want.

32:38.624 --> 32:40.459
We don't have to wait
for our happy ending.

32:40.492 --> 32:43.029
We have it.

33:26.305 --> 33:27.473
[Ronnie] Snack time!

33:27.506 --> 33:31.043
I got the juiciest Fuji apples
from the farmer's market.

33:31.077 --> 33:32.078
Mind if I join you?

33:32.111 --> 33:33.645
I'm not really hungry.

33:33.679 --> 33:36.515
Kaylie, we're on a program now
and it's working.

33:36.548 --> 33:38.050
You can't go back
to restricting.

33:38.084 --> 33:42.088
No, it's not that, Mom.
I promise.

33:42.121 --> 33:45.557
I just...
[sighing]

33:45.591 --> 33:47.059
I have something on my mind.

33:47.093 --> 33:50.162
And I'm learning that
to be healthy

33:50.196 --> 33:54.266
you have to be totally honest,
and sometimes that's really
hard.

33:54.300 --> 33:57.269
Honey, don't forget
how far you've come.

33:57.303 --> 33:59.271
Admitting that you have a
problem is the biggest step

33:59.305 --> 34:04.042
you could take towards your
recovery because it's the part
you had to do alone.

34:04.076 --> 34:07.479
Now you have the support of
people that love you.

34:07.513 --> 34:11.550
Not to mention the new tools and
coping mechanisms you've learned
from Gene...

34:11.583 --> 34:14.820
You can do whatever
you need to do.

34:18.524 --> 34:20.559
I know.

34:20.592 --> 34:22.428
You're right.

34:28.167 --> 34:30.236
[knock on door]

34:30.269 --> 34:33.539
- Who is it?
- It's Kaylie.

34:36.775 --> 34:39.578
[sighing] If you're here to tell
me how much you believe in me,

34:39.611 --> 34:40.812
you're wasting your time.

34:40.846 --> 34:43.782
I don't really know what
you're talking about.

34:43.815 --> 34:47.419
But that's not why I'm here.
I need to talk to you.

34:50.556 --> 34:52.224
About Damon.

34:54.493 --> 34:56.428
Packing or unpacking?

34:56.462 --> 34:59.298
What about Damon?

34:59.331 --> 35:05.337
Look, Emily, I've learned that
I do have a disease

35:05.371 --> 35:08.407
and a big part of that is
not telling the truth.

35:08.440 --> 35:10.176
And I can't do that anymore.

35:10.209 --> 35:13.245
I need to have integrity
and tell the truth now,

35:13.279 --> 35:14.580
no matter what.

35:16.215 --> 35:17.416
The truth about what?

35:19.718 --> 35:21.387
Damon and I kissed.

35:21.420 --> 35:25.657
But, it was one time and we just
caught up in the music and

35:25.691 --> 35:29.328
[stammering] it didn't
mean anything, Emily.

35:29.361 --> 35:31.463
Look, I know you two
were broken up,

35:31.497 --> 35:32.731
but that doesn't matter.

35:32.764 --> 35:34.800
I know what it's like to
be betrayed by a friend

35:34.833 --> 35:36.635
and I'd never do that to you.

35:36.668 --> 35:40.406
[stammering]
I needed to come clean.

35:42.641 --> 35:46.445
Emily. Did you hear me?

35:47.479 --> 35:51.283
I know this really sucks.

35:51.317 --> 35:54.253
I'm so sorry.

36:06.198 --> 36:08.600
[exhaling sharply]

36:33.792 --> 36:37.529
Sixteen and pregnant...

36:37.563 --> 36:41.500
I'm sorry, did I hear "yes",
a turkey burger?

36:41.533 --> 36:44.403
I didn't know I was pregnant,
Teen Mom...

36:44.436 --> 36:47.906
Have you ever noticed our
culture is obsessed with girls
having babies?

36:47.939 --> 36:51.677
I mean, they're on
magazine covers now!

36:51.710 --> 36:54.813
Where is all this
anger coming from?

36:55.881 --> 36:57.383
Emily's pregnant.

36:57.416 --> 36:59.851
Oh, no.

37:02.588 --> 37:03.922
Poor Emily.

37:03.955 --> 37:05.757
Poor Emily?

37:05.791 --> 37:07.326
What about poor team?

37:07.359 --> 37:09.295
Her stupid mistake
is hurting all of us.

37:09.328 --> 37:12.498
Don't you think you're being
a little harsh?

37:12.531 --> 37:13.499
So what if I am?

37:13.532 --> 37:14.633
Emily was selfish.

37:14.666 --> 37:16.902
You can't have a career
and a boyfriend.

37:16.935 --> 37:18.270
She knew that.

37:18.304 --> 37:20.606
I get why you're upset.

37:20.639 --> 37:23.309
I know how hard you've worked
to get on the World Team.

37:23.342 --> 37:25.544
But so did Emily.

37:25.577 --> 37:26.812
Think how she must feel.

37:27.846 --> 37:29.681
But what am I supposed to do?

37:29.715 --> 37:32.551
We all put up with so much
crap from each other

37:32.584 --> 37:36.355
because we're not just friends.
We're a team.

37:36.388 --> 37:39.425
And we go through the most
grueling training in the world
together.

37:39.458 --> 37:41.259
And she just deserted us!

37:41.293 --> 37:43.929
- She didn't desert you, Payson.
- Yes! She did!

37:43.962 --> 37:47.433
And I'm so tired of trying to
lead a team who doesn't care as
much as I do.

37:47.466 --> 37:49.267
Well, I'll tell you something.

37:49.301 --> 37:53.539
You don't sound like much
of a leader right now.

38:01.647 --> 38:03.415
We need to see Emily.

38:03.449 --> 38:05.351
[sobbing] She's not here.

38:05.384 --> 38:07.986
Ms. Kmetko, we know why she
doesn't want to see anyone.

38:08.019 --> 38:10.656
She needs us. We're her team
and we are here for her.

38:10.689 --> 38:13.425
- She's not here.
- Where is she?

38:13.459 --> 38:18.364
She's on a bus, to Las Vegas,
to see her godmother.

38:18.397 --> 38:19.931
She decided to have the baby.

38:22.334 --> 38:23.435
She's gone?

38:28.640 --> 38:32.578
[sobbing] You girls keep
fighting now, okay.

38:41.887 --> 38:44.322
We need to do something.

38:44.356 --> 38:46.825
There isn't anything to do.

38:46.858 --> 38:49.395
I don't want to be
alone right now.

38:49.428 --> 38:50.629
[Payson] Me neither.

38:50.662 --> 38:52.431
So where should we go?

38:52.464 --> 38:53.865
What do we do?

38:56.435 --> 38:58.036
I know.

38:58.069 --> 39:00.772
[melodic rock playing]

39:00.806 --> 39:04.443
* Will always fade

39:04.476 --> 39:10.315
* And the simple things
seem harder now *

39:10.348 --> 39:13.952
* The hours seem

39:13.985 --> 39:17.489
* To last like days

39:17.523 --> 39:20.459
* But her fragile breath

39:20.492 --> 39:23.629
* Is still around

39:23.662 --> 39:27.466
* You miss the sound

39:27.499 --> 39:32.804
* Of the girl
who broke in two *

39:32.838 --> 39:37.476
* And though I'll never know
why the saddest words are
goodbyes *

39:37.509 --> 39:40.446
* But my memories
hold their youth *

39:40.479 --> 39:46.452
* The girl who broke in two

39:46.485 --> 39:49.421
* You gotta pay the cross
if you're gonna face the loss *

39:49.455 --> 39:55.461
* Of the one who
broke inside of you **

39:57.996 --> 40:00.365
[Kaylie] Gymnastics camp is
where we belong right now.

40:00.398 --> 40:02.133
It's like our church.

40:02.167 --> 40:06.972
Well, before we drove 2 1/2
hours to "church" we could've
picked up some food.

40:07.005 --> 40:08.940
I was so mad at her.

40:08.974 --> 40:12.410
I was so damn mad at her.

40:14.846 --> 40:17.415
I don't think even our parents
understand what we go through.

40:17.449 --> 40:19.951
What team really means to us.

40:19.985 --> 40:21.453
No one understands.

40:21.487 --> 40:25.123
Gymnastics is so hard.

40:25.156 --> 40:27.092
And team it's like...

40:27.125 --> 40:29.160
...the other soldiers in the
foxhole with you.

40:29.194 --> 40:30.529
In a war.

40:30.562 --> 40:31.830
[Lauren] Team is like...

40:31.863 --> 40:34.733
...our tightly woven
little safety net.

40:34.766 --> 40:40.806
Pull one thread and the whole
thing can just fall apart.

40:40.839 --> 40:43.475
This feels like a wake.

40:46.712 --> 40:48.780
I knew she'd never make it.

40:48.814 --> 40:51.182
I did.

40:51.216 --> 40:55.521
But I also understand
something you both don't.

40:55.554 --> 40:57.489
I understand why Emily
is keeping the baby.

40:57.523 --> 41:00.125
She has this little child,
that will always love her,

41:00.158 --> 41:02.460
no matter what.

41:02.494 --> 41:03.929
And a great guy

41:03.962 --> 41:07.799
who will adore her
forever and ever.

41:07.833 --> 41:11.102
And I can understand
wanting to keep that.

41:11.136 --> 41:14.105
You know what
the worst part is?

41:15.140 --> 41:17.442
She was good enough.

41:17.475 --> 41:20.712
She could've gone all the way.

41:20.746 --> 41:23.715
She was the real deal.

41:23.749 --> 41:25.116
But she couldn't
keep it together.

41:25.150 --> 41:28.186
And she was one of us.

41:28.219 --> 41:30.956
She'll always be a part of us.

41:32.991 --> 41:34.860
Oh, hey, remember this?

41:42.100 --> 41:46.605
- Crap.
- What do we do now?

41:46.638 --> 41:48.574
Maybe we should just head back.

41:48.607 --> 41:50.075
Your parents are
going to kill us.

41:50.108 --> 41:52.644
- I don't want to go back.
- Neither do I.

41:52.678 --> 41:54.746
I just wanna stay here.

41:54.780 --> 41:57.883
No. I mean,
I don't want to go back.

41:57.916 --> 42:01.052
Back to hiding from gymnastics.

42:01.086 --> 42:02.854
I'm not ready to
give up on this dream.

42:02.888 --> 42:06.558
I don't want to lose everything
that I've worked for.

42:06.592 --> 42:08.560
I want to go back.

42:08.594 --> 42:10.562
To training. To The Rock.

42:10.596 --> 42:13.231
Finally. We have
missed you so much.

42:13.264 --> 42:14.866
And we really need you.

42:14.900 --> 42:18.536
You have no idea how much I miss
you and need you guys too.

42:18.570 --> 42:19.905
[Ronnie] It's like a funeral.

42:19.938 --> 42:22.507
For them I think it is.

42:22.540 --> 42:24.175
[Ronnie] Think we should go in?

42:24.209 --> 42:26.912
No, let's give them
a couple more moments.

42:26.945 --> 42:29.981
So what do we do now?

42:30.015 --> 42:33.118
Do what we always do.

42:33.151 --> 42:35.153
Like when Lauren beat you
for best gymnast at camp

42:35.186 --> 42:40.091
when we were ten and you two
swore you'd never speak again.

42:40.125 --> 42:44.295
Or when you guys
fought over Carter,

42:44.329 --> 42:46.632
or when I broke my back.

42:46.665 --> 42:49.167
I mean, we move forward.

42:49.200 --> 42:51.236
To the Olympic podium.

42:51.269 --> 42:54.172
Just like we
promised each other.

42:54.205 --> 42:58.610
Hey! Why do you guys
always get to have the fun?

42:58.644 --> 43:00.211
We thought you'd be mad at us.

43:00.245 --> 43:01.880
Not this time, kiddo.

43:01.913 --> 43:04.049
You guys have no idea
how hungry we are.

43:04.082 --> 43:05.717
We kinda had a feeling.

43:05.751 --> 43:08.053
And we thought we'd
all camp out together.

43:08.086 --> 43:09.320
Is that okay?

43:09.354 --> 43:11.990
We also come to
share some news.

43:12.023 --> 43:14.025
I don't how much more news
I can handle today.

43:14.059 --> 43:15.060
You said it.

43:15.093 --> 43:17.028
I think you'll want
to hear this news.

43:17.062 --> 43:19.064
[Kim] OK, The news is...
we just got word.

43:19.097 --> 43:20.932
The new coach for the United
States team

43:20.966 --> 43:23.902
going to the World
Championships... is Sasha Belov.

43:23.935 --> 43:25.971
[all cheering]

43:28.840 --> 43:30.575
[Ronnie] All right, let's eat.

43:30.608 --> 43:32.811
[Payson] Please say you
brought marshmallows.
