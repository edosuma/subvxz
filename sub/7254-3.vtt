WEBVTT

00:00.126 --> 00:02.836
Hey, punch me in the stomach.

00:02.847 --> 00:03.474
What ?

00:03.484 --> 00:05.273
Real quick --
Jab, jab. Not too hard.

00:05.283 --> 00:06.931
Just enough to cause a
little internal bleeding.

00:06.961 --> 00:08.132
That sounds pretty hard.

00:08.143 --> 00:09.155
Yeah, true.

00:09.165 --> 00:12.697
Plus, internal bleeding is internal,
which means it can't be proven.

00:12.707 --> 00:15.067
And unless my mother sees blood,
there's no way she's gonna let you

00:15.097 --> 00:16.351
take me to the hospital.
You're right.

00:16.385 --> 00:18.462
You're gonna have to punch me in
the face. Real quick, jab, jab.

00:18.493 --> 00:20.261
I am not going to
punch you in the face.

00:20.277 --> 00:21.743
Why? I'll heal.

00:21.759 --> 00:23.902
And I'd much rather spend the
night in the germy emergency room

00:23.935 --> 00:26.552
getting 8 to 10 stitches
than go in there for dinner.

00:26.565 --> 00:28.330
Plus, it'll give me
a really groovy scar.

00:28.347 --> 00:30.320
- I've always wanted a groovy scar.
- Mom.

00:30.335 --> 00:32.023
What? It'd be such a
great conversation piece.

00:32.057 --> 00:33.413
"Where did you get
that groovy scar?"

00:33.446 --> 00:36.003
"Oh, my daughter dropkicked
me for no apparent reason."

00:36.018 --> 00:36.942
She's totally psycho.

00:36.956 --> 00:38.240
Oh, so now I'm dropkicking you?

00:38.256 --> 00:40.422
Giving you options. You didn't
like the whole jab, jab thing.

00:40.455 --> 00:42.623
We haven't had dinner
with them in three weeks.

00:42.636 --> 00:43.920
Suck it up. We're going in.

00:43.935 --> 00:45.631
Hey, you didn't make it through
the last dinner, which means

00:45.667 --> 00:48.201
technically, you've had four weeks,
which means you owe me one.

00:48.217 --> 00:50.653
- I stayed for cocktail hour.
- That's the best part.

00:50.665 --> 00:52.260
I can't help that it's
at the beginning.

00:52.276 --> 00:54.163
Okay, fine,
then you stay through dessert,

00:54.175 --> 00:56.051
and I'll leave early to
go spend time with Logan.

00:56.088 --> 00:57.881
- Oh, I miss Logan.
- Yeah, me too.

00:57.885 --> 00:59.971
Let's talk about him
for four or five hours.

00:59.986 --> 01:01.940
- We're going inside.
- No! Gonna be horrible.

01:01.957 --> 01:03.043
They're always horrible.

01:03.056 --> 01:06.041
No, it's gonna be horribler
because of the whole Luke thing.

01:06.056 --> 01:08.703
Doesn't your mom already kind of
know because of the house debacle?

01:08.737 --> 01:10.801
No, she suspects,
but she doesn't know know.

01:10.816 --> 01:11.853
I'm gonna have to tell them.

01:11.887 --> 01:14.811
Well, just tell them real quick,
like ripping a band-aid off.

01:14.826 --> 01:17.491
Like ripping a band-aid off
that's been superglued, stapled,

01:17.506 --> 01:19.132
and surgically
embedded in my arm.

01:19.148 --> 01:21.831
Just tell them,
and then we can move on.

01:21.847 --> 01:24.120
We can talk about more pleasant things,
like the middle east.

01:24.156 --> 01:25.712
I don't know how they're
gonna come at me, you know.

01:25.747 --> 01:28.122
I know they're gonna come at me,
but I don't know how.

01:28.135 --> 01:30.741
I mean, it could be guilt,
pity, anger, contempt.

01:30.758 --> 01:31.841
They have so many options.

01:31.857 --> 01:34.501
In all likelihood, it will be
a combination of all of those.

01:34.518 --> 01:36.252
I don't want the whole
night to be about Luke.

01:36.287 --> 01:37.733
It won't be. Don't worry.

01:37.747 --> 01:40.341
Just put it out there,
and then when they attack you,

01:40.357 --> 01:42.510
whatever angle they're coming from,
I will deflect.

01:42.527 --> 01:44.280
- How will you deflect?
- Well, I don't know.

01:44.285 --> 01:46.183
Maybe I will talk
about Bangalore.

01:46.198 --> 01:47.741
You know a lot about Bangalore?

01:47.755 --> 01:50.280
Don't you?
Bangalore? Outsourcing?

01:50.297 --> 01:52.220
You know, when you call customer
service, you're almost always talking

01:52.256 --> 01:54.800
to some nice dude in India
who speaks perfect english.

01:54.816 --> 01:55.911
Don't you read Time magazine?

01:55.948 --> 01:57.623
It doesn't seem like
a rich subject area.

01:57.638 --> 01:59.222
- Yeah.
- No! Uhh!

01:59.238 --> 02:02.193
Oh, I know. You tell them
you're converting to judaism,

02:02.205 --> 02:04.470
and that will throw the
friday-night-dinner thing in jeopardy.

02:04.508 --> 02:06.101
There you go.

02:07.368 --> 02:08.580
Hello.

02:08.598 --> 02:10.000
- Hi.
- Hello.

02:10.018 --> 02:12.423
Come in. May I take your coats?

02:12.495 --> 02:15.170
Well, okay. Here you go.

02:15.337 --> 02:17.643
- That's a pretty dress.
- Thank you.

02:17.655 --> 02:19.171
Oh.

02:19.186 --> 02:21.322
- You okay there?
- I'm fine.

02:21.338 --> 02:22.471
Right this way.

02:22.488 --> 02:23.843
- Weird.
- So weird.

02:23.857 --> 02:25.181
- It's a child, right?
- Pretty sure.

02:25.215 --> 02:27.371
Maybe mom has run out of
adults who will work for her.

02:27.385 --> 02:29.420
Hi, mom. Hi, dad.

02:29.437 --> 02:31.131
Good evening, Rory. Lorelai.

02:31.145 --> 02:32.572
Hi, grandma. Hi, grandpa.

02:32.586 --> 02:35.691
Well  done, Charlotte. C.C. guest
couldn't have done it better herself.

02:35.707 --> 02:37.300
Thank you, Mrs. Gilmore.

02:37.316 --> 02:41.362
Lorelai, Rory, allow me to
introduce Charlotte Courtwright.

02:41.375 --> 02:44.071
Charlotte, this is Lorelai
Gilmore and Rory Gilmore,

02:44.085 --> 02:45.620
my granddaughter
and her mother.

02:45.638 --> 02:46.700
It's a pleasure to meet you.

02:46.738 --> 02:48.361
Oh, a pleasure.

02:48.376 --> 02:49.132
Hi.

02:49.148 --> 02:52.313
Charlotte's grandparents, Arthur and
Beverly, are dear friends of ours.

02:52.328 --> 02:55.760
In fact, it was the Courtwrights who
put us up for membership at blackledge.

02:55.776 --> 02:56.813
Isn't that right, Richard?

02:56.816 --> 02:58.731
Indeed it is,
although I have a feeling

02:58.748 --> 03:01.992
Arthur did that just so he could
humiliate me on the links every sunday.

03:02.006 --> 03:03.480
Hell of a golfer,
your grandfather.

03:03.497 --> 03:06.693
Yes, he used to be scratch,
but now he's a 3.

03:06.705 --> 03:08.851
You know, "Charlotte's web"
is one of my favorite books.

03:08.887 --> 03:10.760
Spiders talking to pigs.
What could be better then that?

03:10.797 --> 03:12.410
Can I offer anyone a cocktail?

03:12.426 --> 03:14.932
Uh... okay. Sure.
Is that legal?

03:14.947 --> 03:16.732
She'll have a
martini with a twist.

03:16.747 --> 03:18.262
Scotch on the
rocks for Richard.

03:18.277 --> 03:19.772
"G" and "T" for me. Rory?

03:19.786 --> 03:21.340
Just a club soda, please.

03:21.355 --> 03:23.922
Would you like that straight
up or on the rocks?

03:23.935 --> 03:26.030
Straight up. Thanks.

03:27.205 --> 03:29.730
You're never too young to
learn to make a martini.

03:29.747 --> 03:30.953
Who is that?

03:30.965 --> 03:32.560
I told you.

03:32.578 --> 03:35.040
It's the Courtwrights'
granddaughter, Charlotte.

03:35.055 --> 03:37.063
Why is she taking our coats
and pouring us drinks?

03:37.075 --> 03:38.693
Did you win her
in a poker game?

03:38.707 --> 03:41.510
Your mother has been dragooned
by her colleagues at the D.A.R.

03:41.527 --> 03:44.361
to lend her expertise to this
year's summer cotillion.

03:44.377 --> 03:46.203
It's been quite
a responsibility.

03:46.217 --> 03:49.483
But Eliza Appleton insisted that
there was simply no one she knew

03:49.498 --> 03:52.192
who was better suited to preparing
these girls for society living.

03:52.207 --> 03:53.580
I could hardly say no.

03:53.597 --> 03:54.270
Here we are.

03:54.287 --> 03:56.721
- Oh. Thank you, Charlotte.
- Thank you.

03:56.736 --> 03:59.293
- Martini straight up.
- Oh. Thanks.

03:59.306 --> 04:00.230
Thank you.

04:00.245 --> 04:02.543
So, nothing for you?
You driving tonight?

04:02.557 --> 04:04.651
Oh, Lorelai, I'm only 10.

04:04.667 --> 04:07.833
In any case, Charlotte missed last
week's session on table manners,

04:07.846 --> 04:10.642
so we've decided to make
tonight's dinner a makeup class.

04:10.658 --> 04:13.072
I'm awfully sorry about that,
Mrs. Gilmore.

04:13.086 --> 04:16.630
My grandparents took me to a
Count Basie tribute at Tanglewood.

04:16.646 --> 04:18.800
Charlotte, you might have noticed
that the ice cubes in my glass

04:18.834 --> 04:20.000
have  already melted.

04:20.017 --> 04:23.230
There's a whole ice bucket up there.
There's no need to be so stingy.

04:23.248 --> 04:24.780
I'm sorry.

04:24.797 --> 04:28.103
For future reference.
It's obvious too late now.

04:28.717 --> 04:31.273
This  is your chance.
Get out while you still can.

04:31.288 --> 04:33.533
I can show you all the
good escape routes.

04:33.547 --> 04:37.193
Mrs. Gilmore warned me you'd
be full of smart remarks.

04:39.000 --> 04:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:32.135 --> 05:35.032
Now, tonight we'll be dining
with service à la russe,

05:35.048 --> 05:37.250
which has nothing to do with russians --
thank god --

05:37.265 --> 05:40.303
because in my experience, their
table manners are nothing to emulate.

05:40.316 --> 05:44.062
All it means is that the servers
will be passing each course in turn

05:44.075 --> 05:46.173
instead of plopping all the
food on the table at once,

05:46.206 --> 05:47.891
like some mukluk picnic.

05:47.905 --> 05:50.532
Now, it is the duty of the gentleman
to help a lady to her seat.

05:50.548 --> 05:52.050
- Richard, would you?
- It is my pleasure.

05:52.086 --> 05:53.060
We can seat ourselves.

05:53.075 --> 05:56.561
Yeah, seating us is more of a privilege,
not a duty.

05:56.573 --> 05:58.441
Now, immediately upon sitting,

05:58.457 --> 06:01.173
one should place one's
napkin in one's lap.

06:01.189 --> 06:03.252
And, mind you,
no need for a flourish.

06:03.267 --> 06:06.821
The ability to use a napkin
is nothing to brag about.

06:06.915 --> 06:08.640
The table looks
beautiful, grandma.

06:08.655 --> 06:09.590
Well, thank you, Rory.

06:09.608 --> 06:11.011
What's with all the forks?

06:11.028 --> 06:13.061
Every piece of silverware
has a purpose.

06:13.076 --> 06:16.492
You simply work from the outermost
utensil in towards your plate.

06:16.507 --> 06:18.012
Can you name each
of these forks?

06:18.025 --> 06:20.491
Each one of these forks
is gonna take 20 minutes.

06:20.508 --> 06:22.160
And then the fish fork,

06:22.175 --> 06:24.143
and then the entrée fork,

06:24.158 --> 06:26.820
and then --
is this the dessert?

06:26.837 --> 06:29.282
Oh, wait --
it's for the roast course, isn't it?

06:29.298 --> 06:31.122
Exactly. Very good, Charlotte.

06:31.138 --> 06:32.940
Hey, you're gonna wow
them at your cotillion.

06:32.958 --> 06:34.402
Did you ever attend
a cotillion?

06:34.418 --> 06:37.350
No, I haven't, actually,
but I had a coming-out party.

06:37.365 --> 06:39.173
And I totally
supported her decision.

06:39.185 --> 06:41.120
She shouldn't have to
hide her love for women.

06:41.135 --> 06:43.452
Lorelai, there's nothing
funny about being a lesbian.

06:43.466 --> 06:45.240
I'm sure you'll have
fun at your cotillion.

06:45.256 --> 06:47.251
I'm very much looking
forward to it.

06:47.265 --> 06:50.220
Oh, don't get too excited.
Cotillions are not fun parties.

06:50.235 --> 06:54.250
They're boring rituals to train
a whole new generation of snobs.

06:54.267 --> 06:55.713
And how exactly would you know?

06:55.726 --> 06:57.702
Lorelai never actually
attended a cotillion.

06:57.715 --> 07:00.732
You don't have to jump off the Empire
State Building to know it's gonna hurt.

07:00.766 --> 07:03.133
Um, this looks delicious,
Mrs. Gilmore.

07:03.158 --> 07:05.310
It's just a simple
potage au cresson.

07:05.327 --> 07:07.423
I thought you were gonna
rip off the band-aid.

07:07.438 --> 07:10.031
The kid threw me off. I'm looking
for an opening. I'll find it.

07:10.048 --> 07:12.431
...to ladle the broth
away from our bodies.

07:12.446 --> 07:14.960
Rory, how has the summer
been treating you so far?

07:14.976 --> 07:17.270
It's treating me very well so far,
thank you.

07:17.288 --> 07:19.770
Are you relaxing in preparation
for your senior year?

07:19.788 --> 07:21.353
Well, I've been doing
some part-time work.

07:21.388 --> 07:23.910
Paris opened this business,
a tutoring business,

07:23.928 --> 07:26.291
and it prepares people
for the S.A.T.s.

07:26.307 --> 07:28.783
It's kind of like the
princeton review but meaner.

07:28.798 --> 07:30.323
Sounds very enterprising.

07:30.335 --> 07:31.982
And what about your
social calendar?

07:31.996 --> 07:34.112
Do you have anything
particularly exciting planned?

07:34.128 --> 07:36.960
Not really.
Logan's in London, so...

07:36.977 --> 07:39.832
Logan is Rory's boyfriend.
He's a Huntzberger.

07:40.045 --> 07:41.753
How is Logan enjoying London?

07:41.766 --> 07:44.063
I think he likes it.
He's working a lot

07:44.075 --> 07:47.070
and meeting different department heads,
getting situated,

07:47.087 --> 07:48.791
learning to talk british,
you know.

07:48.805 --> 07:51.851
Lorelai, how's summer with you?
Anything new?

07:51.865 --> 07:55.600
Um... we planted some
pansies at the Dragonfly,

07:55.618 --> 07:57.603
in the back there.
They look good.

07:57.618 --> 08:02.221
And, um,
I finally bought a new dvd player.

08:02.237 --> 08:04.191
And...

08:04.726 --> 08:06.683
Luke and I broke up.

08:06.698 --> 08:08.651
Did you? That's too bad.

08:14.327 --> 08:16.561
Now, Charlotte,
when the conversation lags,

08:16.575 --> 08:19.780
a good guest ought to be prepared
to introduce a new topic.

08:19.796 --> 08:22.401
Keep it light --
no politics, no religion.

08:22.415 --> 08:23.630
My little trick?

08:23.645 --> 08:25.030
Just think of things
that you've read

08:25.065 --> 08:27.551
in the middle three sections of
the sunday New York Times --

08:27.567 --> 08:29.793
Travel, arts & leisure,
sunday styles --

08:29.808 --> 08:31.670
And  forget the rest
of the paper exists.

08:31.686 --> 08:33.443
Look, it's all right.

08:33.455 --> 08:35.643
- What is?
- We can talk about the breakup.

08:35.658 --> 08:37.900
I'm sure you have
thoughts on the subject,

08:37.916 --> 08:40.501
and why don't we get it
all out in the open now

08:40.515 --> 08:42.770
so we can move on
with our lives?

08:42.784 --> 08:44.121
I've moved on.

08:44.136 --> 08:46.261
Richard, anything
you'd like to add?

08:46.278 --> 08:48.162
I can't think of a thing.

08:48.176 --> 08:49.762
All right, then.

08:49.775 --> 08:51.633
Isn't it interesting
how they're renovating

08:51.646 --> 08:53.720
so many of the old
paradores in Spain?

08:53.737 --> 08:56.221
It's funny you should mention that
because last week at the club,

08:56.256 --> 08:58.152
Chick Walsh told me
that he and Mary

08:58.166 --> 09:01.061
stayed at this extraordinary
old castle near Madrid.

09:01.076 --> 09:03.412
Where was it? Um, uh, Lerma.

09:03.428 --> 09:05.043
Lerma? How nice.

09:05.057 --> 09:07.241
Excuse me. Uh, what's going on?

09:07.255 --> 09:08.982
Why are we talking about Lerma?

09:08.995 --> 09:11.121
- It's a town in Spain.
- Yes, I understand geography,

09:11.136 --> 09:13.550
but why are you avoiding
the subject of my breakup?

09:13.566 --> 09:16.520
Honestly, Lorelai, I see no point
in continuing this conversation.

09:16.536 --> 09:19.390
We couldn't possibly say anything right,
so why say anything at all?

09:19.405 --> 09:20.520
That's not true.

09:20.535 --> 09:21.730
It absolutely is.

09:21.746 --> 09:23.353
You could say something.
You could try.

09:23.365 --> 09:24.973
You could say,
"I'm sorry, Lorelai.

09:24.987 --> 09:26.560
This must be a very
hard time for you."

09:26.575 --> 09:28.303
Well, I am sorry, Lorelai.

09:28.317 --> 09:30.131
I'm sure this is a very
hard time for you.

09:30.145 --> 09:31.311
That's it? That's all?

09:31.326 --> 09:33.033
I just said what
you said to say.

09:33.047 --> 09:35.201
You don't have anything
of your own to add?

09:35.215 --> 09:37.051
I'm sure whatever Luke did --

09:37.067 --> 09:39.321
See? It's so interesting,
because you blame it on him,

09:39.335 --> 09:40.603
and you don't even
know the whole story.

09:40.635 --> 09:41.233
Mom...

09:41.247 --> 09:42.493
I knew we couldn't
talk about this.

09:42.527 --> 09:44.093
I should have claimed
I had laryngitis.

09:44.107 --> 09:46.810
Lorelai, your mother is
simply expressing our regrets

09:46.825 --> 09:48.541
that you've ended your
relationship with Luke.

09:48.578 --> 09:50.303
I hardly see how
that's offensive.

09:50.315 --> 09:52.053
Fine.

09:52.645 --> 09:55.513
Only that's not true.
You never liked Luke.

09:55.528 --> 09:58.150
You never showed him
anything but total contempt.

09:58.167 --> 10:00.591
That's not true.
I played golf with Luke.

10:00.608 --> 10:01.413
Once.

10:01.427 --> 10:03.152
We were planning on buying
the two of you a house.

10:03.185 --> 10:06.232
Doesn't the fact that we were willing
to spend an enormous amount of money

10:06.247 --> 10:08.103
on a wedding present
count for anything?

10:08.118 --> 10:09.070
So, that's what
you're mad about?

10:09.108 --> 10:11.350
You're mad about the enormous amount
of money you might have wasted?

10:11.387 --> 10:11.981
Mom!

10:11.996 --> 10:13.342
That's not what I was saying.

10:13.358 --> 10:14.500
Well, you implied it.

10:14.518 --> 10:17.240
- Lorelai, this--
- Bangalore! Bangalore!

10:17.255 --> 10:18.971
Bangalore.

10:27.738 --> 10:29.462
- Hi.
- Morning, Ace.

10:29.475 --> 10:30.191
Thanks.

10:30.205 --> 10:31.441
How's your day going?

10:31.455 --> 10:34.363
My day hasn't started yet.
How was your yesterday?

10:34.845 --> 10:36.203
I'm still sleepy.

10:36.217 --> 10:37.623
I can let you go back to sleep.

10:37.635 --> 10:39.551
No, no, I'm up.

10:39.618 --> 10:40.802
I'm up.

10:40.816 --> 10:42.422
What  happened yesterday?

10:42.437 --> 10:44.242
My yesterday or your yesterday?

10:44.257 --> 10:45.062
Either one.

10:45.075 --> 10:47.441
Let's see...
I had a scone for breakfast --

10:47.455 --> 10:50.451
not as dry as monday's, but I still
think there's room for improvement.

10:50.468 --> 10:53.172
And then I went into a meeting with
about 18 different department heads,

10:53.208 --> 10:54.810
all of whom I believe
are named Nigel,

10:54.828 --> 10:57.442
and that meeting lasted
for about nine hours.

10:57.455 --> 10:58.853
Was it a cranberry scone?

10:58.867 --> 10:59.870
Blueberry.

10:59.885 --> 11:01.283
Those are my favorite kind.

11:01.296 --> 11:02.060
Your turn.

11:02.076 --> 11:04.760
Well, I'm tutoring
this new kid, Benji.

11:04.776 --> 11:08.402
And, oh, it was really funny
because he kept misusing this word.

11:08.418 --> 11:10.772
I don't remember what word it was,
but it'll come to me.

11:10.787 --> 11:13.400
Anyway, he kept misusing it,
and I didn't want to correct him

11:13.416 --> 11:15.142
'cause I didn't want
him to feel embarrassed.

11:15.177 --> 11:17.081
But then he messed up
on the work sheet,

11:17.096 --> 11:20.702
and then he realized all by himself
that he had misused the word.

11:20.716 --> 11:23.400
I guess it wasn't
funny "ha ha."

11:23.427 --> 11:25.880
It was more funny "you
had to be there."

11:25.897 --> 11:27.343
That's okay.

11:28.307 --> 11:29.453
Are you working?

11:29.467 --> 11:30.922
Just I.M.'ing.

11:32.635 --> 11:33.901
If you have to go --

11:33.915 --> 11:35.851
No, I just have to let my assistant
know I'm on the phone with you

11:35.886 --> 11:37.281
so I'll be 2 minutes
late to the meeting.

11:37.316 --> 11:38.823
I don't want you to be
late for your meeting.

11:38.858 --> 11:40.572
It's no problem. I don't mind.

11:40.585 --> 11:43.503
Well, now I feel like I have really to
come up with something great to talk about.

11:43.535 --> 11:44.972
No pressure.

11:46.186 --> 11:48.020
- What?
- Nothing.

11:48.037 --> 11:49.402
Now you really do have to go.

11:49.418 --> 11:51.283
Well, yeah.

11:51.298 --> 11:52.622
"Philanthropic."

11:52.636 --> 11:53.513
What?

11:53.527 --> 11:56.113
Philanthropic, that was the
word that Benji kept misusing.

11:56.127 --> 11:57.380
He kept saying "philantropic."

11:57.395 --> 11:58.831
He thought it meant
"tropical." It was funny.

11:58.866 --> 12:01.113
- I'll call you tonight.
- My tonight or your tonight?

12:01.126 --> 12:02.322
Got to go, Ace.

12:02.337 --> 12:04.071
Okay. Bye.

12:18.048 --> 12:19.950
Are you enjoying
your breakfast?

12:19.967 --> 12:21.803
I don't know if
I like pop-tarts.

12:21.818 --> 12:23.532
Did you fall on your head
while you were sleeping?

12:23.565 --> 12:25.923
I don't know. Do I like this?
Is this something I like?

12:25.936 --> 12:27.290
So, you fell on your head,
and now you have

12:27.328 --> 12:29.590
some kind of very specific amnesia.
Is that it?

12:29.608 --> 12:33.243
I mean, last night I was dreading mom
and dad's reaction to the breakup, right?

12:33.256 --> 12:35.163
Right. Dread, dread.
I remember.

12:35.178 --> 12:37.530
Then they didn't react --
not one bit.

12:37.548 --> 12:39.620
It's almost like the absence
of their reaction was worse

12:39.657 --> 12:41.652
than any freak-out
they could have had.

12:41.668 --> 12:42.720
Okay. Sure.

12:42.736 --> 12:44.580
Then I thought, "why?

12:44.595 --> 12:47.703
Why do I care if they freak out?
I mean, what do I get out of it?"

12:47.715 --> 12:49.850
And then I thought,
"maybe their freak-outs

12:49.866 --> 12:52.181
are like some kind of compass for me,
you know,

12:52.197 --> 12:55.423
like, I know I'm doing what I want
to do if it freaks them out."

12:55.437 --> 12:57.833
And then I thought,
"what if I don't want to do

12:57.848 --> 12:59.860
what I want to do
because I want to do it,

12:59.877 --> 13:01.941
but because they
don't want me to?"

13:01.956 --> 13:02.671
Huh?

13:02.685 --> 13:04.883
I mean, what if I don't like
what I like because I like it,

13:04.917 --> 13:06.702
but because my mother
doesn't like it

13:06.717 --> 13:08.013
and doesn't want me to like it?

13:08.028 --> 13:11.440
What if I don't actually
like the music that I like

13:11.458 --> 13:14.242
or the movies or the
clothes or the men?

13:14.258 --> 13:16.570
What if I don't like
what I seem to like?

13:16.586 --> 13:19.071
- Ah, hence the pop-tart.
- Yes. Hence.

13:19.087 --> 13:21.241
I can remember the first
time I had a pop-tart.

13:21.255 --> 13:23.041
It was at my friend
Erica Catcha's house,

13:23.055 --> 13:24.613
and she said,
"do you want a pop-tart?"

13:24.626 --> 13:26.842
And I knew my
mother would recoil

13:26.858 --> 13:28.492
at the very idea of
me having a pop-tart.

13:28.496 --> 13:31.180
I could just picture her.
"A pop-tart?!"

13:31.197 --> 13:32.762
And so, I had one.

13:32.777 --> 13:35.593
And I opened the
little silver wrapper,

13:35.605 --> 13:37.111
and I took a bite,

13:37.126 --> 13:40.023
and I thought nothing
had ever tasted so good.

13:40.036 --> 13:43.703
I thought it tasted
like freedom.

13:43.716 --> 13:46.152
It tasted like I
was my own person.

13:46.167 --> 13:48.831
The pop-tart tasted
like freedom

13:48.845 --> 13:51.153
and rebellion and independence.

13:51.168 --> 13:53.581
Wow. That's some pop-tart.
What flavor was that?

13:53.595 --> 13:56.850
But now I think I don't
know if I like pop-tarts.

13:56.865 --> 13:58.291
What if I don't like pop-tarts?

13:58.307 --> 13:59.560
Would I like pop-tarts

13:59.576 --> 14:02.262
if Richard and Emily had served
me pop-tarts on a silver platter

14:02.275 --> 14:04.513
and demanded I eat every bite?
I don't know.

14:04.526 --> 14:06.132
Hey, where are
all the pop-tarts?

14:06.148 --> 14:07.262
I've been experimenting.

14:07.277 --> 14:08.423
You ate all the pop-tarts?

14:08.438 --> 14:10.550
If it makes you feel any better,
I don't know if I like them!

14:10.586 --> 14:12.672
Well, I hope you didn't
eat all the froot loops.

14:12.685 --> 14:15.032
Hey, how was last
night's conversation?

14:15.047 --> 14:17.223
- Eh.
- Eh-eh?

14:17.238 --> 14:19.390
It's just these
transatlantic phone calls.

14:19.407 --> 14:21.301
I don't know if it's the
"trans" or the "atlantic"

14:21.338 --> 14:23.021
or the fact that it's
2:00 in the morning,

14:23.035 --> 14:24.932
but Helen Keller
and Stephen Hawking

14:24.945 --> 14:26.681
could have a more
connected conversation.

14:26.695 --> 14:27.751
Helen Keller's dead.

14:27.767 --> 14:30.321
Yeah, well, even dead,
she could do better.

14:30.337 --> 14:32.661
It's just so awkward and pausy.

14:32.675 --> 14:34.283
And I feel like the
more I try to connect,

14:34.318 --> 14:35.850
the more disconnected I feel.

14:35.867 --> 14:37.563
And I just feel like
I'm working so hard,

14:37.576 --> 14:39.871
but maybe I shouldn't be
having to work so hard.

14:39.886 --> 14:42.343
And then I feel self-conscious,
but I shouldn't feel self-conscious,

14:42.375 --> 14:44.511
so then I feel
self-conscious about that.

14:44.526 --> 14:46.401
I don't know,
maybe it's just the salt in the ocean.

14:46.437 --> 14:48.351
It corrodes conversations
or something.

14:48.365 --> 14:50.533
Yeah. It sounds like the salt.

14:50.598 --> 14:52.742
- Hey!
- I like pop-tarts.

15:01.136 --> 15:02.572
Here you go, ladies.

15:02.588 --> 15:04.581
It's the ceilings.
They're vaulted now, aren't they?

15:04.618 --> 15:05.763
The ceilings aren't vaulted.

15:05.778 --> 15:07.031
I got it, it's the curly fries.

15:07.047 --> 15:09.431
You  never used to have curly
fries here before, did you, Luke?

15:09.468 --> 15:10.941
Always had curly fries.

15:10.955 --> 15:13.252
I'm telling you,
something's different about the place.

15:13.267 --> 15:16.003
Nothing. Nothing has changed.
It's exactly the same.

15:16.017 --> 15:17.583
He must have done
something to the windows

15:17.617 --> 15:19.061
'cause the light is
much better now.

15:19.078 --> 15:21.452
Yeah, it's a lot less
gloomy than it used to be.

15:21.466 --> 15:23.312
An identical level
of gloom, people.

15:23.326 --> 15:25.402
I got it. You got new chairs.

15:25.415 --> 15:27.420
I knew my butt felt
more comfortable.

15:27.437 --> 15:29.281
Yeah, your butt feels
exactly the same, Babette.

15:29.318 --> 15:32.810
Now, would you two can it?
I didn't change a damn thing.

15:35.748 --> 15:38.140
- Hey, Rory.
- Hi, Luke.

15:38.166 --> 15:39.600
How's it going?

15:39.826 --> 15:42.100
Good. I'm good. And you?

15:42.118 --> 15:43.010
Doing good.

15:43.027 --> 15:44.793
Glad to hear that.

15:44.876 --> 15:46.730
Congratulations on
the reopening.

15:46.745 --> 15:50.093
Oh, yeah, thanks.
Back to normal, I guess.

15:50.108 --> 15:51.602
- New hat?
- Yeah.

15:51.888 --> 15:54.690
So, I didn't think you were
gonna make it back this summer.

15:54.707 --> 15:57.920
Oh, I wasn't, but then I did.

15:57.936 --> 16:00.180
- Things change.
- Yeah.

16:01.936 --> 16:02.952
So, you want a table?

16:02.965 --> 16:06.731
No, I think I'll just take some coffee
and a muffin to go, if you have it.

16:06.747 --> 16:08.633
- I have it.
- It's the curtains!

16:08.645 --> 16:10.091
Yeah, those curtains
have always been here.

16:10.125 --> 16:12.392
I know. I'm just saying you
used to have more curtains.

16:12.408 --> 16:14.592
No, I never had more curtains.

16:15.137 --> 16:17.412
- Hi.
- Lane, hey, come over here.

16:19.667 --> 16:22.891
Hey. So? How did it go?

16:22.905 --> 16:24.543
Was it hard? Did he freak out?

16:24.556 --> 16:25.711
What are you talking about?

16:25.728 --> 16:27.940
Zach... and the pregnancy.

16:27.955 --> 16:29.960
Oh. That.
I haven't told him yet.

16:29.976 --> 16:30.852
Really?

16:30.865 --> 16:33.372
Yeah, I was,
but now I'm thinking I'm gonna wait.

16:33.387 --> 16:35.343
Okay. For how long?

16:35.357 --> 16:36.881
I don't know. A couple years?

16:36.895 --> 16:37.632
Lane!

16:37.648 --> 16:39.692
I'm gonna tell him eventually,
just not yet.

16:39.708 --> 16:42.423
Besides, a lot of people
wait a full 12 weeks

16:42.436 --> 16:43.790
before they tell anyone
they're pregnant.

16:43.825 --> 16:45.011
Not the husband.

16:45.027 --> 16:48.023
I just need a little more
time to adjust, you know?

16:48.038 --> 16:51.272
I kind of want to process this
by myself a little longer.

16:51.288 --> 16:53.460
You can wait as
long as you want.

16:53.477 --> 16:55.511
You can wait until the baby
comes out and have her tell him.

16:55.545 --> 16:57.091
- Her?
- Or him.

16:57.106 --> 16:59.123
It could be a him?
Oh, god, I'm not ready for a him!

16:59.157 --> 17:01.352
- Maybe it'll be a her.
- Who's ready for a her?!

17:01.365 --> 17:04.740
You are. And Zach is.
You guys can do this.

17:04.756 --> 17:05.970
Hey, you want to tell him?

17:05.988 --> 17:08.192
One coffee. One muffin.

17:08.208 --> 17:10.311
One employee
sitting at a table.

17:10.326 --> 17:11.400
Sorry, Luke.

17:11.415 --> 17:13.520
- Thanks, Luke. See you later.
- See you later.

17:13.537 --> 17:16.213
- New mugs!
- Hey! Same mugs.

17:19.498 --> 17:21.560
Wow. Somebody's
all fancy-pants.

17:21.578 --> 17:23.440
I've never seen your
hair up like that.

17:23.454 --> 17:25.432
I'm just trying out a new look,
seeing if I like it,

17:25.464 --> 17:27.201
serving no master but myself.

17:27.218 --> 17:29.910
Are you gonna try pigtails, too?
Because that's kind of my thing.

17:29.926 --> 17:31.132
It's freeing, really.

17:31.147 --> 17:34.562
I never realized how my mother
influenced my every decision,

17:34.577 --> 17:36.383
even decisions that don't
seem like decisions,

17:36.418 --> 17:37.561
like tying my shoes.

17:37.576 --> 17:40.073
I mean, I've always been a fan
of the bunny ears, you know?

17:40.087 --> 17:42.831
And this morning I
decided not to bunny-ear,

17:42.848 --> 17:43.750
and you know what happened?

17:43.787 --> 17:44.383
No.

17:44.398 --> 17:47.511
Turns out bunny ears take a lot
longer than the regular way.

17:47.527 --> 17:49.223
I saved like three
seconds this morning.

17:49.235 --> 17:51.032
What does your mother have
to do with bunny ears?

17:51.065 --> 17:52.632
My mother is everywhere --

17:52.646 --> 17:54.680
in my shoes,
in my clothes, in my food.

17:54.696 --> 17:56.142
- Your mother is here.
- In my Inn.

17:56.158 --> 17:58.251
What do you mean? What are you
talking about? Why is my mother here?

17:58.286 --> 18:00.961
She's here to taste
the menu for the tea.

18:01.085 --> 18:02.653
Why doesn't she know
what I'm talking about?

18:02.687 --> 18:03.541
What tea?

18:03.555 --> 18:05.142
I thought you were
going to tell her.

18:05.156 --> 18:05.893
What tea?

18:05.907 --> 18:07.351
I was going to tell her.

18:07.365 --> 18:10.183
Then I considered what it would
be like if I did not tell her,

18:10.198 --> 18:12.163
and I thought it
might be more fun.

18:12.175 --> 18:13.883
- I was right.
- What tea?

18:13.898 --> 18:15.943
Lorelai, do you normally keep
your guests waiting like that?

18:15.976 --> 18:17.792
It's very rude. Hello, Sookie.

18:17.806 --> 18:19.763
Hi, Mrs. Gilmore. Welcome.

18:19.778 --> 18:21.221
What tea?

18:21.238 --> 18:22.822
There's no need to
shout, Lorelai.

18:22.835 --> 18:24.990
I'm bringing the girls here
friday for afternoon tea

18:25.005 --> 18:26.472
as part of their
etiquette training.

18:26.486 --> 18:27.963
Here? Why are you
bringing them here?

18:27.966 --> 18:29.500
Actually, I was going to
take them into the city

18:29.535 --> 18:31.063
for high tea at the Pierre.

18:31.077 --> 18:33.491
But the maître d' at the
Pierre apparently believes

18:33.507 --> 18:37.153
that proper high tea includes
club sandwiches and a juice bar,

18:37.165 --> 18:40.071
and I simply couldn't subject
these impressionable young girls

18:40.085 --> 18:41.773
to such tasteless effrontery.

18:41.785 --> 18:43.423
Do they even have
tea at a cotillion?

18:43.437 --> 18:44.693
Don't be absurd.

18:44.708 --> 18:47.651
As long as I have them under my wing,
I feel that it is my duty

18:47.665 --> 18:50.801
to offer them as much of
my expertise as possible.

18:50.818 --> 18:53.202
Last week we went
to the symphony

18:53.215 --> 18:55.382
and the hopper
exhibit at the Met.

18:55.398 --> 18:58.533
This week it's high tea and
"Rigoletto" at Lincoln Center.

18:58.547 --> 18:59.791
Have you done that thing
where they walk around

18:59.826 --> 19:02.040
with books on their heads?
That's always a good one.

19:02.058 --> 19:03.770
Sookie, these are
simply divine.

19:03.785 --> 19:06.431
It's the lemon zest.
It makes all the difference.

19:06.447 --> 19:09.332
Although, we definitely shouldn't
serve the spinach quiche.

19:09.348 --> 19:11.712
Some of the girls have braces,
and their mothers would never forgive me

19:11.748 --> 19:14.502
if they spent the evening
with hideous green smiles.

19:14.517 --> 19:18.220
Perhaps shrimp salad or a more
traditional cream cheese and cucumber

19:18.238 --> 19:19.271
would be more appropriate?

19:19.275 --> 19:21.021
Yum. Cucumber.

19:21.786 --> 19:23.383
Is that peanut
butter and jelly?

19:23.396 --> 19:25.682
Yes. I just thought since
the girls were only 10

19:25.695 --> 19:28.491
that they'd enjoy it more than
the smoked-salmon sandwiches.

19:28.508 --> 19:30.270
They're 10.
They're not animals.

19:30.286 --> 19:33.840
This is a proper tea, Sookie.
I'm not interested in circus food.

19:33.856 --> 19:35.371
Stings, don't it?

19:35.387 --> 19:37.960
I'd like to see the room we'll be using.
If the lighting isn't right,

19:37.995 --> 19:39.572
we may have to make
some adjustments.

19:39.586 --> 19:41.393
Right this way.

19:42.226 --> 19:44.611
I like your hair
like that, Lorelai.

19:50.466 --> 19:51.922
It's a good sentence,
but you want to make sure

19:51.956 --> 19:53.521
never to end with
a preposition.

19:53.535 --> 19:54.863
If she ended the sentence
with a preposition,

19:54.898 --> 19:56.521
how could it have
been a good sentence?

19:56.535 --> 19:57.872
Sounds like a
terrible sentence.

19:57.887 --> 19:59.112
- Oh, I just--
- You were just coddling her,

19:59.147 --> 20:00.893
that's what you were just doing.
You want to prop her up on your knee

20:00.928 --> 20:02.723
and burp her, too,
maybe buy her a pony?

20:02.736 --> 20:05.443
I'm not paying you to make her feel
better about her incompetence.

20:05.457 --> 20:07.090
If she can't construct
a proper sentence,

20:07.098 --> 20:09.432
how is she gonna pass the
essay section of the S.A.T.?

20:09.445 --> 20:10.501
- Well --
- That was rhetorical!

20:10.537 --> 20:12.062
Carry on.

20:14.515 --> 20:15.883
Why don't you go
slower, Dalton?

20:15.895 --> 20:18.972
'Cause you haven't been on the same page
for the last 20 minutes or anything.

20:19.866 --> 20:22.051
Okay, "doctor is
to hospital as,

20:22.066 --> 20:23.833
"'A,' sports fan is to stadium,

20:23.848 --> 20:25.282
'B,' ice is to freezer,

20:25.296 --> 20:26.862
'C' professor is to college,

20:26.878 --> 20:28.710
or, 'D,' criminal is to jail?"

20:28.727 --> 20:31.290
Um, "A," sports
fan is to stadium?

20:31.305 --> 20:34.080
It's actually "C,"
professor is to college.

20:34.097 --> 20:35.382
When you're doing
this kind of analogy,

20:35.418 --> 20:37.020
you have to be a
little more specific

20:37.038 --> 20:39.242
than just filling in the
blank with "is found in."

20:39.256 --> 20:40.781
A doctor works in a hospital,

20:40.795 --> 20:43.152
just as a professor
works in a college.

20:43.167 --> 20:44.221
Make sense?

20:44.235 --> 20:45.211
You're really smart.

20:45.225 --> 20:46.583
Thanks. That's
very sweet, Eric.

20:46.596 --> 20:48.052
And you're just as smart.
I promise.

20:48.066 --> 20:49.401
Are you kidding me with this?

20:49.418 --> 20:51.482
That's it! Pencils down.
That means you, Casanova.

20:51.497 --> 20:53.312
Time is up! Everyone out.

20:53.327 --> 20:55.193
Unless your parents want to
start paying for overtime,

20:55.226 --> 20:57.361
which for many of you
might be a good idea.

20:57.376 --> 20:59.542
Not so fast, employees.

20:59.556 --> 21:01.552
Today's work was
shoddy at best.

21:01.568 --> 21:03.902
Between the overt coddling and
the inappropriate flirting,

21:03.918 --> 21:05.660
I feel like I'm
running a bordello.

21:05.676 --> 21:08.441
Gilmore, do you see any of my
students falling in love with me?

21:08.456 --> 21:10.422
No. And you know why?
Because you don't fall in love

21:10.455 --> 21:12.451
with people that make you
want to crap your pants.

21:12.465 --> 21:14.153
I want to see terror
in their eyes!

21:14.165 --> 21:17.261
Fear is a great motivator, people.
Use it.

21:17.277 --> 21:19.180
What are you standing
around here for? Go!

21:19.198 --> 21:20.723
Dismissed.

21:22.776 --> 21:24.102
Okay, I'm not your
boss anymore.

21:24.116 --> 21:25.502
We can do five minutes
of friend time.

21:25.537 --> 21:27.950
I appreciate the offer,
but I have to make a phone call, so...

21:27.987 --> 21:29.242
- Logan?
- Yep.

21:29.257 --> 21:30.193
How's that going?

21:30.206 --> 21:32.292
It's good, you know? It's fine.

21:32.308 --> 21:33.880
- So, it's awful?
- No.

21:33.898 --> 21:36.522
Because you downgraded from good
to fine in under two seconds,

21:36.536 --> 21:37.732
so I figured I'd
cut to the chase.

21:37.768 --> 21:40.863
Not awful.
It's just hard because of the distance.

21:41.048 --> 21:42.712
Uh-huh. How's the sex?

21:42.728 --> 21:45.712
Um, well,
seeing as he's in London and I'm here,

21:45.725 --> 21:47.672
the sex is pretty
much nonexistent.

21:47.686 --> 21:49.890
You've got a phone. Use it.

21:49.905 --> 21:51.892
What? You mean...

21:52.487 --> 21:53.543
I can't do that.

21:53.558 --> 21:54.932
I talk to my mother
on that phone.

21:54.947 --> 21:56.372
Okay, what about texting?

21:56.388 --> 21:57.833
No. No, thank you.

21:57.847 --> 21:59.722
Why not? You say stuff when
you're together, don't you?

21:59.755 --> 22:01.052
Yeah. I guess. Sometimes.

22:01.067 --> 22:03.243
So, text it. Texting is great.

22:03.256 --> 22:05.001
And you can do it while
you're doing other things.

22:05.036 --> 22:06.443
Doyle and I are
doing it right now.

22:06.456 --> 22:07.810
What?

22:08.716 --> 22:09.963
Oh, my god!

22:09.975 --> 22:11.550
Don't worry. This is advanced.

22:11.565 --> 22:13.833
Right now, all you're looking
to do is create some intimacy.

22:13.865 --> 22:14.853
Stick to the basics.

22:14.865 --> 22:16.203
I don't have any basics.

22:16.217 --> 22:17.102
Write what you know.

22:17.117 --> 22:18.771
Thanks, Paris.
I'll figure something out.

22:18.787 --> 22:20.141
Doyle thinks it's a great idea.

22:20.155 --> 22:21.643
Okay, can you not talk
about me on that thing

22:21.675 --> 22:23.282
when you're doing
that with him?

22:23.296 --> 22:24.202
Sorry.

22:24.216 --> 22:25.631
Jeez.

22:29.818 --> 22:31.960
I'm telling you, man,
she's totally avoiding me.

22:31.977 --> 22:33.920
She won't even talk to me.
She'll barely look at me.

22:33.957 --> 22:35.671
It's over. She's divorcing me.

22:35.687 --> 22:37.352
I'll admit it,
it's not the best marriage I've seen,

22:37.385 --> 22:38.892
although I only have my
parents to compare it to,

22:38.926 --> 22:40.113
and they're unusually happy.

22:40.127 --> 22:42.852
We were happy once,
and then that stupid honeymoon happened.

22:42.868 --> 22:45.282
And ever since we came home,
it's like she's a different person.

22:45.317 --> 22:47.142
- Maybe it was the parasite.
- What do you mean?

22:47.178 --> 22:49.010
You know, maybe the parasite
like got into her brain

22:49.048 --> 22:50.570
and ate away the part that
was in love with you.

22:50.607 --> 22:52.192
I just can't believe it's over.

22:52.205 --> 22:54.132
I mean, we haven't even written
our thank-you notes yet.

22:54.168 --> 22:55.082
I was gonna say.

22:55.095 --> 22:56.901
Hey man,
I already told you we like the bowl.

22:56.916 --> 22:58.911
Doesn't mean I don't
deserve a note.

23:00.648 --> 23:02.202
It's all gonna be okay, Zach.

23:02.216 --> 23:05.152
I'm here for you, man.
I got your back.

23:06.326 --> 23:07.542
Hey, that's nice.

23:07.555 --> 23:10.080
Yeah, the pain is
totally helping my music.

23:11.965 --> 23:13.260
We need to talk.

23:13.278 --> 23:14.552
Okay.

23:14.565 --> 23:16.283
Let's talk.

23:16.298 --> 23:17.912
Alone?

23:18.418 --> 23:21.923
Anything you have to say to me,
you can say in front of Brian.

23:22.288 --> 23:24.163
I'm pregnant.

23:29.717 --> 23:31.113
With a baby?

23:31.125 --> 23:33.403
Yes, pregnant with a baby.

23:33.418 --> 23:35.133
But how? When?

23:35.146 --> 23:37.743
On a beach in Mexico,
about three weeks ago.

23:37.758 --> 23:38.933
I'm pretty sure you were there.

23:38.966 --> 23:40.611
But we only did it once.

23:40.627 --> 23:42.881
Once is really all it takes.

23:46.657 --> 23:49.823
- Where are you going?
- Brian must be freaking out!

23:50.985 --> 23:52.680
Good afternoon, Lorelai.

23:52.698 --> 23:55.312
Oh, my goodness.

23:55.327 --> 23:57.030
Is the library ready for us?

23:57.046 --> 23:59.021
Yes, the tables are set,
and the tea is brewed,

23:59.036 --> 24:00.463
and I've hired some
extra poor people

24:00.498 --> 24:02.773
for the girls to look down on.

24:02.788 --> 24:05.880
She's the one I told you about --
a regular Imogene Coca.

24:05.895 --> 24:08.403
Oh, my god, I love them.

24:08.417 --> 24:12.001
They are like madame
Alexander dolls come to life.

24:12.017 --> 24:16.781
All right, ladies, chins up,
tummies in, and glide.

24:23.248 --> 24:25.481
Now, remember, ladies,
the dress you'll be wearing

24:25.495 --> 24:29.021
at the cotillion on saturday
will have much fuller skirts.

24:29.038 --> 24:31.331
Several of you may be
working with a crinoline,

24:31.348 --> 24:33.830
so sitting will be an entirely
different experience.

24:33.847 --> 24:36.310
What is the rule of thumb
we can always apply?

24:36.328 --> 24:37.043
Tiffany?

24:37.056 --> 24:38.383
Bottoms out.

24:38.398 --> 24:39.803
That's right.

24:39.818 --> 24:42.371
Bottoms, sit.

24:42.387 --> 24:43.212
Very good.

24:43.226 --> 24:45.830
Such elegance,
such a sense of decorum,

24:45.845 --> 24:47.733
manners, grace, charm --

24:47.746 --> 24:50.581
everything my childhood
could have been but wasn't.

24:50.598 --> 24:52.903
Oh, to go back and do it right.

24:52.917 --> 24:54.092
Hey, that's cool!

24:54.108 --> 24:56.911
Caroline, we do not grab or
grope our dinner partners.

24:56.928 --> 24:58.870
Sorry, Mrs. Gilmore.

24:58.888 --> 25:02.363
Always maintain proper
spacing and distance.

25:02.375 --> 25:04.800
It's all coming back to me.
Proper spacing and distance.

25:04.815 --> 25:06.111
Other kids were
hugged and kissed.

25:06.145 --> 25:08.643
I was taught to maintain
proper spacing and distance.

25:08.658 --> 25:11.792
...in which case,
the utensil rule still applies.

25:11.806 --> 25:15.760
No utensil, once used,
may ever touch the table again.

25:15.775 --> 25:18.632
Imagine leaving a ring
of raspberry preserves

25:18.647 --> 25:20.480
on a set of fine linens.

25:20.495 --> 25:22.203
Granted, these linens
aren't the best.

25:22.217 --> 25:26.211
But at the cotillion on saturday,
everything will be of the highest quality.

25:26.228 --> 25:30.290
All right, ladies,
choose your first sandwich.

25:30.308 --> 25:32.852
- Take me.
- Oh, Michel!

25:32.865 --> 25:35.232
Take me to the cotillion.
I have to be there.

25:35.247 --> 25:36.552
I want to go back
and do it right.

25:36.585 --> 25:38.180
- No, forget it.
- I insist.

25:38.196 --> 25:39.772
You must take me.
You have no choice.

25:39.786 --> 25:41.583
I have no choice?
Do you know me?

25:41.597 --> 25:43.172
I'm not going to my
mother's cotillion.

25:43.187 --> 25:44.470
You owe me.

25:44.488 --> 25:47.082
- What? I do not.
- Oh, yes, you do.

25:47.098 --> 25:49.093
Last november,
when you were going out of town

25:49.107 --> 25:51.990
and nervous about boarding
Paul Anka for the first time,

25:52.007 --> 25:54.412
you forced me,
against my better judgment,

25:54.425 --> 25:56.630
to have Paul Anka over
to my home for the day

25:56.645 --> 25:58.610
so he could acclimate
to other dogs.

25:58.625 --> 26:01.471
Well, not only did he
traumatize my poor chows,

26:01.487 --> 26:04.250
but somehow he managed
to get into my closet,

26:04.265 --> 26:06.680
the door of which
was firmly closed...

26:06.697 --> 26:08.070
I know.
I don't know how he does that.

26:08.108 --> 26:11.192
...and proceeded to poop
in my Prada loafers.

26:11.205 --> 26:12.580
Well, he knows good quality.

26:12.595 --> 26:14.403
When I returned
your foul creature

26:14.416 --> 26:15.972
and told you about
what happened,

26:15.986 --> 26:19.271
you apologized profusely
and then wrote an I.O.U.

26:19.285 --> 26:23.193
on several little post-its,
thinking it was all so clever.

26:23.208 --> 26:25.320
Gosh, I don't remember that.

26:25.335 --> 26:27.632
I thought as much.

26:27.648 --> 26:31.490
...on the seat of your chair. Do not
leave it carelessly strewn about the table.

26:31.508 --> 26:33.150
Caroline?

26:33.688 --> 26:35.851
Caroline!

26:39.787 --> 26:42.733
"I"..."O"..."U"...

26:42.747 --> 26:46.190
"one"..."big"..."favor."

26:46.205 --> 26:48.161
Can't prove I wrote that.

26:48.178 --> 26:49.930
"Lorelai Gilmore."

26:49.947 --> 26:51.471
- Ohh! I'll buy you a car.
- No.

26:51.488 --> 26:53.032
- A house.
- Pick me up at 7:00.

26:53.045 --> 26:53.642
Michel!

26:53.656 --> 26:56.303
And wear your hair like
you had it the other day.

26:58.075 --> 26:59.422
Good nap, babe?

26:59.435 --> 27:01.041
Yeah, I was really out of it.

27:01.057 --> 27:03.043
I'm so tired all the time.
It's weird.

27:03.058 --> 27:04.602
Huh. Must be the heat.

27:04.617 --> 27:07.163
Yeah, right, I guess that could
have something to do with it.

27:07.175 --> 27:08.020
Beer?

27:08.036 --> 27:10.622
No, I don't think I'll be
drinking beer for a while.

27:10.638 --> 27:13.601
Oh, that's cool.
Going a little straightedge.

27:13.617 --> 27:16.330
But we probably should be
drinking more calcium,

27:16.345 --> 27:19.342
so maybe I should keep an extra
gallon of milk around the house.

27:19.355 --> 27:20.412
No problemo.

27:20.425 --> 27:22.390
And I may start having
cravings soon --

27:22.405 --> 27:24.603
Oh man!
You know what I'm craving right now?

27:24.618 --> 27:27.053
Pizza bagels. Those are definitely
going on the grocery list.

27:27.066 --> 27:28.620
- Want some of those?
- Sure.

27:28.637 --> 27:32.203
Do you like that, mountain ninja?
Do you like the taste of my broadsword?

27:32.215 --> 27:33.982
Well, I'm off to see Rory.

27:33.998 --> 27:35.800
Have fun.

27:46.115 --> 27:47.481
Yikes. Oh, no.

27:47.497 --> 27:49.010
- Whoa!
- That's disgusting.

27:49.028 --> 27:51.050
- Wow.
- No way! No way!

27:51.065 --> 27:52.571
I can't write this
stuff to Logan.

27:52.587 --> 27:54.552
I can barely read it to myself.
I'm bright red.

27:54.567 --> 27:56.283
Did you notice no one
ever gives details

27:56.295 --> 27:57.761
when they tell you
about childbirth?

27:57.775 --> 28:01.801
It's because the details are
gross and scary and unacceptable.

28:01.817 --> 28:02.750
Like what?

28:02.768 --> 28:04.610
Well, apparently,
in about three months,

28:04.627 --> 28:07.470
I can look forward to
dark spots on my face

28:07.488 --> 28:09.243
because it's not enough
to just get fat.

28:09.258 --> 28:11.130
It's not fat. It's a baby.

28:11.148 --> 28:12.952
A baby that will
shoot out of my body

28:12.965 --> 28:15.422
despite the fact that it's
obviously much too large.

28:15.436 --> 28:16.843
I didn't think this through
when we were dating.

28:16.876 --> 28:19.062
I was all into the fact that
Zach was big and manly,

28:19.076 --> 28:20.921
which means I'm gonna have a big,
manly baby,

28:20.935 --> 28:21.872
and I'm a small woman.

28:21.888 --> 28:23.712
I never thought of
Zach as big and manly.

28:23.725 --> 28:25.002
Compared to Henry Lee?

28:25.015 --> 28:26.682
Remember when my mom wanted
me to date Henry Lee?

28:26.717 --> 28:27.791
He was like yea high.

28:27.807 --> 28:29.833
I would have had tiny,
little, yea-high babies.

28:29.847 --> 28:31.043
Yeah, but he was
your second cousin.

28:31.077 --> 28:33.270
I think you would have had other
problems with those babies.

28:33.307 --> 28:34.742
Whatever. I'm not doing it.

28:34.757 --> 28:36.770
This baby is just gonna have
to find another way out

28:36.805 --> 28:38.753
or stay in there forever.
I really don't care.

28:38.766 --> 28:41.652
Don't worry about that part. Just keep
taking things one step at a time.

28:41.665 --> 28:43.802
- You're doing great.
- How? How am I doing great?

28:43.816 --> 28:46.072
You told Zach.
That was a very significant step.

28:46.086 --> 28:48.483
Yeah, I told him,
but I'm pretty sure he forgot.

28:48.498 --> 28:49.642
What do you mean he forgot?

28:49.656 --> 28:52.873
I don't know how things get lost
in the recesses of Zach's brain,

28:52.888 --> 28:53.833
but I think he forgot.

28:53.846 --> 28:56.320
Well, maybe he's just taking
time to process all of this.

28:56.337 --> 28:57.383
You needed some time.

28:57.395 --> 28:59.931
I am growing a human
being inside my body.

28:59.947 --> 29:02.391
I deserve time. Ugh!

29:02.598 --> 29:05.002
Okay, what about this?

29:05.018 --> 29:06.493
"Where is the chair you sit in?

29:06.505 --> 29:09.020
Where is your favorite comb,
your toothbrush, your nail file?

29:09.035 --> 29:11.680
Trot them out,
that I may devour them at one gulp."

29:11.698 --> 29:12.850
You want to eat his toothbrush?

29:12.888 --> 29:15.831
No, I'm trying to convey
that I miss him very much.

29:15.845 --> 29:17.662
Sounds like you miss
his toiletry kit.

29:17.677 --> 29:20.512
It's supposed to be
metaphorical and evocative.

29:20.525 --> 29:21.492
It's Henry Miller.

29:21.505 --> 29:23.040
Henry Miller has better
stuff than that.

29:23.075 --> 29:25.940
Believe me,
that is not why they banned his books.

29:25.955 --> 29:27.340
Well, I'm not gonna write,

29:27.356 --> 29:30.593
"Our hands groped frantically
for the burning flesh."

29:30.607 --> 29:31.590
Oh, that's better.

29:31.607 --> 29:34.002
That's way hotter than
the eating-his-comb thing.

29:34.016 --> 29:34.611
Oh really?

29:34.628 --> 29:36.871
Why not? Go for it. Why are you making 
such a big deal out of this?

29:36.885 --> 29:38.330
I'm just worried, you know?

29:38.346 --> 29:40.823
I mean, we talk to each
other on the phone every day,

29:40.836 --> 29:44.131
but I just don't think that that's
enough to keep this relationship going.

29:44.148 --> 29:46.581
I guess I never realized how
important the other stuff was.

29:46.598 --> 29:47.641
The sex stuff?

29:47.658 --> 29:48.841
And the holding-hands

29:48.856 --> 29:51.101
and the falling-asleep-
next-to-each-other stuff.

29:51.115 --> 29:54.481
I mean, that's where the crazy intimacy
comes from, and without those options,

29:54.498 --> 29:57.962
when they're just taken away from
you 'cause someone moves to London...

29:58.258 --> 30:00.222
Desperate measures.

30:00.976 --> 30:03.051
Burn that flesh, sister.

30:04.815 --> 30:06.602
Okay.

30:06.618 --> 30:08.381
Here it goes.

30:10.837 --> 30:12.112
I think I'm gonna puke.

30:12.126 --> 30:14.542
Join me. That's all I'll be
doing for the next two months.

30:14.556 --> 30:16.282
Oh, and did I mention
the extra hair

30:16.296 --> 30:19.671
that may start to grow on my chin?
Can't wait for that magic.

30:20.207 --> 30:22.510
Ooh, wow, quick response.
I think you did good.

30:22.526 --> 30:23.403
It's not him.

30:23.415 --> 30:24.322
Hi, dad.

30:24.336 --> 30:25.931
Hey, kiddo. What are you up to?

30:25.947 --> 30:28.750
Um, just reading. Reading the books.
What are you doing?

30:28.767 --> 30:30.020
Just drinking the coffee,

30:30.037 --> 30:31.251
thinking I haven't
seen you in a while.

30:31.288 --> 30:32.631
I know. I miss you.

30:32.646 --> 30:35.440
Me too. So, maybe we could have
dinner tomorrow night if you're free.

30:35.456 --> 30:36.970
- Tomorrow night?
- Only if you're free.

30:37.006 --> 30:38.833
I'm free.
Yeah, that sounds like fun.

30:38.848 --> 30:39.792
- Yeah?
- Sure.

30:39.806 --> 30:42.120
Great. That's great.
I'll pick you up about 7:00.

30:42.135 --> 30:43.082
Cool. I'll see you tomorrow.

30:43.116 --> 30:44.352
Bye, Rory.

30:44.368 --> 30:46.512
Maybe I'll look
good with a beard.

30:50.436 --> 30:52.361
Whoa! Can I keep this?

30:52.377 --> 30:53.733
First, help me find
something to wear tonight.

30:53.766 --> 30:55.231
Then you can steal whatever you want,
except that --

30:55.266 --> 30:56.451
I'm getting buried in that.

30:56.466 --> 30:58.823
I just don't understand why
you're going to this cotillion.

30:58.825 --> 31:01.681
Does Michel have compromising photographs 
of you, that I don't know about,

31:01.716 --> 31:03.603
like some snapshots
from your perm year?

31:03.617 --> 31:06.222
No, but he does have post-its.

31:06.236 --> 31:08.381
Word to the wise. Don't
ever put anything in writing,

31:08.417 --> 31:11.460
'cause even when it's on florescent
sticky paper, it's still binding.

31:11.475 --> 31:15.322
You are so wise and
awesome and generous.

31:15.336 --> 31:16.973
Yeah, you can steal
anything you want

31:16.987 --> 31:18.391
if you go to the
cotillion for me.

31:18.408 --> 31:20.413
- Can't.
- Why? You don't have any work.

31:20.426 --> 31:22.020
You don't have a
boyfriend to play with.

31:22.037 --> 31:24.002
You barely have anyone
to hang out with at all.

31:24.018 --> 31:26.232
Keep going. You're really making
me want to do you a favor here.

31:26.266 --> 31:29.271
I can't tonight because
I have plans with dad.

31:29.596 --> 31:30.451
Your dad?

31:30.467 --> 31:32.962
I'm not in the habit of calling
other people's dads "dad."

31:32.975 --> 31:34.511
Yeah, my dad.

31:34.527 --> 31:37.251
He called and asked me if I
wanted to have dinner with him.

31:37.265 --> 31:38.190
Is that a problem?

31:38.205 --> 31:40.972
No, of course not.
I just didn't realize you were talking.

31:40.987 --> 31:42.430
I haven't talked to him at all,

31:42.447 --> 31:43.671
which is why I was
happy he called,

31:43.705 --> 31:45.662
because we were talking
all the time before.

31:45.677 --> 31:46.711
Yeah, I know.

31:46.728 --> 31:48.133
I mean,
just because you guys aren't talking,

31:48.166 --> 31:50.023
it doesn't mean I'm not
allowed to talk to him, right?

31:50.058 --> 31:52.192
We are not not talking.

31:52.206 --> 31:54.511
We're just not
talking right now.

31:54.528 --> 31:55.250
Okay.

31:55.265 --> 31:57.731
Listen, I think it's great that
you're having dinner with your dad.

31:57.766 --> 31:59.321
- Good.
- Good.

31:59.337 --> 32:00.503
What is with that thing?

32:00.515 --> 32:02.230
I sent Logan a text
message yesterday,

32:02.248 --> 32:03.970
and he still hasn't
written me back.

32:03.987 --> 32:05.460
Plus, we missed our
last two phone calls

32:05.498 --> 32:07.930
'cause he keeps getting dragged
into this boring meetings.

32:07.946 --> 32:09.403
If he hasn't sent you anything back,
it's probably

32:09.437 --> 32:11.042
'cause he just
hasn't had time yet.

32:11.056 --> 32:12.490
Yeah, that's probably it.

32:12.505 --> 32:14.573
Can I wear this
to the cotillion?

32:15.307 --> 32:16.822
Mnh-mnh.

32:20.806 --> 32:22.990
Something wrong with
your dinner, babe?

32:23.008 --> 32:24.133
If your bagel's
a little frozen,

32:24.165 --> 32:25.700
I can microwave that
bad boy for you.

32:25.715 --> 32:28.400
It's not that.
I'm just feeling a little queasy.

32:28.418 --> 32:31.462
Yeah, I've been
feeling queasy, too.

32:31.476 --> 32:33.271
I'm telling you,
it's got to be the heat.

32:33.288 --> 32:34.471
Do you want to go to
a movie or something?

32:34.508 --> 32:36.192
Cool down with some free A.C.?

32:36.206 --> 32:38.671
I have a better idea.
Why don't we talk?

32:38.685 --> 32:41.581
Sure. What do you
want to talk about?

32:41.595 --> 32:43.163
The baby.

32:46.558 --> 32:48.500
I'm cool with the
whole baby thing.

32:48.515 --> 32:49.762
- You are?
- Yeah.

32:49.777 --> 32:51.302
So, you're not worried at all?

32:51.316 --> 32:53.082
Nope, no worries on this end.

32:53.096 --> 32:54.050
I see.

32:54.066 --> 32:56.343
I think Brian might be
freaking out a little bit,

32:56.356 --> 32:58.022
but that's his problem.

32:58.038 --> 33:01.252
Really? I didn't know
Brian was concerned.

33:01.266 --> 33:02.423
Well, sure.

33:02.436 --> 33:05.163
I mean, he was just getting used
to the idea of us getting married,

33:05.176 --> 33:07.681
and I don't think he was
expecting a baby yet.

33:07.697 --> 33:10.583
But it's a lot for
the guy to take in.

33:10.596 --> 33:13.153
Absolutely. You know,
maybe I should talk to Brian about this

33:13.168 --> 33:15.961
because it sounds like he
and I are on the same page.

33:15.976 --> 33:16.941
What do you mean?

33:16.957 --> 33:18.743
Well, I'm glad you're fine
with the whole baby thing,

33:18.775 --> 33:20.510
but I'm kind of freaking out.

33:20.527 --> 33:21.472
You are?

33:21.486 --> 33:24.253
Totally. Zach, this is not how
I expected our life to go --

33:24.267 --> 33:28.441
be married for like a day and then suddenly 
having to take on this new responsibility.

33:28.455 --> 33:31.130
Bringing a child into this world,
it's so...

33:31.147 --> 33:33.740
- It's major, right?
- It's very major.

33:33.758 --> 33:36.090
So, you're not all psyched
about being knocked up?

33:36.105 --> 33:37.953
Are you kidding?
This baby sucks!

33:37.968 --> 33:40.000
Yeah! This baby totally sucks!

33:40.018 --> 33:41.540
- It does.
- It so does.

33:41.558 --> 33:43.880
- Do you know what afterbirth is?
- No.

33:44.887 --> 33:46.892
- Dude.
- I know.

33:46.905 --> 33:49.403
You know how the baby is
connected to you by that hose

33:49.417 --> 33:50.812
and I'm supposed
to cut that hose?

33:50.828 --> 33:52.173
No way I'm cutting that hose.

33:52.186 --> 33:53.861
No way I'm letting
you in the room

33:53.877 --> 33:54.840
when that thing
comes out of me.

33:54.875 --> 33:56.943
Oh, man, you are so awesome.
I love you so much.

33:56.957 --> 33:58.943
I love you, too.

34:01.108 --> 34:02.352
It's like you don't even care.

34:02.366 --> 34:03.991
I care about you,
just not this.

34:04.006 --> 34:06.662
After all the trouble I went through
picking out the perfect flower for you.

34:06.695 --> 34:08.672
It's kind of big, don't you think?
It's like wearing a tree on my arm.

34:08.705 --> 34:10.460
- It is an orchid.
- It's scratchy.

34:10.478 --> 34:12.722
Could have got me something,
a simple boutonniere. But no.

34:12.755 --> 34:14.533
- I'm so humiliated.
- Hey, I have an idea.

34:14.547 --> 34:16.652
Why don't we go back to the flower
store, and I'll get you something?

34:16.688 --> 34:17.581
It'll take 2 seconds.

34:17.597 --> 34:20.210
Forget it.
We're late enough as it is.

34:21.568 --> 34:23.753
Yes, I can die now.

34:23.764 --> 34:24.851
Me too.

34:24.867 --> 34:26.462
Look at that girl. Poor thing.

34:26.475 --> 34:29.400
Oh, why did someone force her
to wear those exercise shoes?

34:29.418 --> 34:32.183
She'd probably rather be home,
in jeans, climbing a tree.

34:32.197 --> 34:34.322
She looks perfectly
happy to me.

34:34.337 --> 34:36.772
You know what I see when
I look at this room?

34:36.786 --> 34:39.072
A bunch of kids whose outfits
cost more than my car?

34:39.087 --> 34:43.101
No, these are not kids.
They are perfect, tiny adults.

34:43.118 --> 34:46.511
We are standing amongst the next
generation of movers and shakers.

34:46.525 --> 34:48.581
The future president
of the united states

34:48.596 --> 34:50.679
may be in this room
with us tonight.

34:50.697 --> 34:52.351
You're very odd.

34:52.367 --> 34:54.572
- Lorelai, you're here.
- I am.

34:54.585 --> 34:56.141
Hello, Emily.

34:56.157 --> 35:00.082
Oh, Emily, may I just say that
what you have created here tonight

35:00.096 --> 35:02.843
is nothing short of perfection?

35:02.856 --> 35:06.893
This --
this is a kind of nirvana on earth.

35:06.908 --> 35:10.141
Thank you, Michel.
It's very kind of you to say.

35:10.158 --> 35:13.122
I'm sorry. What on earth
are those musicians playing?

35:13.138 --> 35:14.402
It sounds lovely.

35:14.418 --> 35:16.981
Are those violinists on speed?

35:16.998 --> 35:18.213
Excuse me.

35:18.228 --> 35:19.511
Hey, I'm gonna get some punch.
You want some?

35:19.545 --> 35:22.711
Oh, no, thank you very much.
I'm much too excited for punch.

35:22.728 --> 35:25.141
My throat closes off
when I'm excited,

35:25.156 --> 35:28.091
so swallowing punch would be
very difficult right now.

35:28.107 --> 35:29.363
Okay.

35:30.676 --> 35:33.503
- Lorelai.
- Charlotte, hi.

35:33.515 --> 35:35.733
I'm having the most
wonderful time.

35:35.745 --> 35:37.721
Grandmother, grandfather,
it's my pleasure

35:37.737 --> 35:39.580
to introduce you to
Lorelai Gilmore.

35:39.595 --> 35:41.281
Lorelai, these are
my grandparents --

35:41.297 --> 35:42.813
Beverly and Arthur Courtwright.

35:42.828 --> 35:45.000
Ah, the famous Lorelai.

35:45.017 --> 35:47.643
Famous? I have to catch
up on my us weeklies.

35:47.656 --> 35:49.460
Charlotte told us
you were a card.

35:49.477 --> 35:52.451
She also told us that you were
a delightful dining companion,

35:52.467 --> 35:55.500
like Noel Coward and Slim
Keith rolled into one.

35:55.518 --> 35:57.270
Oh, well,
she's delightful, too,

35:57.285 --> 35:59.062
like Shirley Temple
and mother Teresa

35:59.077 --> 36:02.641
and someone with very good
table manners rolled into one.

36:02.656 --> 36:04.950
It's starting.
The dancing is starting.

36:04.968 --> 36:06.401
We should get the camera.

36:06.418 --> 36:08.501
- Will you excuse us?
- Yeah.

36:08.516 --> 36:10.082
Lorelai, did I tell you?

36:10.097 --> 36:12.862
Margot, Caroline,
and I are doing a hip-hop dance,

36:12.876 --> 36:14.572
and it's gonna be so funny.

36:14.587 --> 36:16.211
We rehearsed it
in the bathroom.

36:16.226 --> 36:19.983
The whole thing ends up with us
somersaulting towards the band.

36:19.996 --> 36:21.810
Wow! That's really great.

36:21.825 --> 36:22.980
Are you gonna come dance?

36:22.997 --> 36:25.363
Oh, no. It's just for the kids.

36:25.375 --> 36:27.371
Oh, come on.
Everybody is dancing.

36:27.388 --> 36:29.943
Pardon me.
Would you like to dance, Charlotte?

36:29.956 --> 36:32.032
I would be delighted, Toby.

36:44.486 --> 36:46.872
People seem to be
enjoying themselves.

36:46.887 --> 36:48.453
Yeah. They really do,
don't they?

36:48.465 --> 36:49.952
Want to dance?

36:49.967 --> 36:51.322
Me? No. Are you serious?

36:51.336 --> 36:52.943
I never joke about dancing.

36:52.956 --> 36:54.660
- No, I'll pass.
- You cannot pass.

36:54.676 --> 36:57.110
This is still my night,
and I'd like to dance with you.

36:57.127 --> 37:00.961
Besides, Charlotte insisted that
I get you out on the dance floor,

37:00.978 --> 37:03.502
so that it's two against one --
you lose.

37:03.518 --> 37:05.940
- Now, let's go.
- Oh!

37:06.285 --> 37:07.543
Well...

37:20.328 --> 37:22.162
I see you're having
a terrible time.

37:22.178 --> 37:23.563
The worst.

37:24.786 --> 37:27.761
So, do you want the rest of this key
lime pie or should I take it with me?

37:27.778 --> 37:29.190
I don't know how you
ordered key lime pie

37:29.227 --> 37:30.820
when there was chocolate
brownie on the menu.

37:30.855 --> 37:32.391
Because you'd already
ordered a chocolate brownie.

37:32.426 --> 37:34.021
But just the one.

37:34.037 --> 37:35.542
Maybe we should give
it to Paul Anka.

37:35.555 --> 37:38.211
After all, the doggie bag was
invented with him in mind.

37:38.226 --> 37:39.822
Seems only fair he
should benefit.

37:39.836 --> 37:42.010
Ther's no way he's
gonna eat that.

37:42.696 --> 37:44.920
- I told you.
- Hey.

37:44.938 --> 37:46.091
Hi, mom.

37:46.108 --> 37:47.812
Hey, we were just
splitting up the food.

37:47.825 --> 37:49.530
I'm... on my way out.

37:49.547 --> 37:51.590
Oh. Take your time.

37:51.906 --> 37:54.561
Is that key lime
pie on the floor?

37:54.576 --> 37:55.990
Is that a corsage on your arm?

37:56.006 --> 37:57.972
Oh, this? Yeah.
Subtle, isn't it?

37:57.987 --> 38:01.460
If by "subtle," you mean "weird and
giant," then, yeah, super subtle.

38:02.316 --> 38:05.102
Okay, I think I'm gonna take
Paul Anka for his walk.

38:05.116 --> 38:06.242
Thanks for dinner, dad.

38:06.258 --> 38:07.861
Yeah, thanks, kiddo.

38:07.966 --> 38:09.312
Come on.

38:10.416 --> 38:11.821
Go on.

38:13.035 --> 38:14.651
Oh, thanks.

38:16.286 --> 38:17.883
Did you guys have fun?

38:17.898 --> 38:19.293
It was good, really good.

38:19.308 --> 38:21.351
First time I ever saw
her order a drink.

38:21.365 --> 38:22.520
Strange, right?

38:22.535 --> 38:24.112
Very strange.

38:25.847 --> 38:27.621
Anyway, I should be going.

38:27.637 --> 38:29.053
I'm sorry I didn't
call you back.

38:29.067 --> 38:31.582
- It's okay.
- I was going to. I just...

38:31.596 --> 38:33.830
I understand.
Don't worry about it.

38:35.116 --> 38:37.342
Do you want some
coffee or anything?

38:37.356 --> 38:39.092
- Sure.
- Okay.

38:46.717 --> 38:49.212
Actually, you know what?
I can't.

38:50.245 --> 38:52.373
Oh. Okay.

38:52.516 --> 38:55.150
I can't just sit here
and have coffee with you.

38:55.167 --> 38:56.483
Okay.

38:56.495 --> 38:58.232
I love you.

38:58.247 --> 39:01.533
I know the other night didn't
mean for you what it did for me,

39:01.547 --> 39:04.541
but I don't regret it and I haven't stopped 
thinking about it since it happened --

39:04.578 --> 39:07.310
not just because it was great,

39:07.325 --> 39:09.212
which it was...

39:09.746 --> 39:12.270
but because it was right.
It was so right, Lore,

39:12.286 --> 39:14.200
and you may not see that right now,
but I do.

39:14.218 --> 39:16.100
And if I have to wait until
we're both 80 years old

39:16.138 --> 39:19.602
for you to see it,
then I'll wait.

39:19.745 --> 39:22.072
I'm not going anywhere.
This is it for me.

39:22.087 --> 39:24.491
You're it for me.

39:25.006 --> 39:27.090
And I can't pretend to
feel any less than I do.

39:27.106 --> 39:29.203
I'm sorry. I-I --

39:29.967 --> 39:31.792
I just can't.

39:55.728 --> 39:57.012
Ace.

39:57.028 --> 39:58.940
Hey, how's it going?

39:59.908 --> 40:02.751
It's 4:45 in the morning.
Are you okay? Did something happen?

40:02.768 --> 40:06.360
Not really. Um, I just --

40:06.378 --> 40:08.790
I sent you a text
the other day.

40:09.726 --> 40:11.970
Yeah, I know.
I texted you back.

40:11.988 --> 40:12.922
No, you didn't.

40:12.937 --> 40:14.501
Yes, I did. Check your phone.

40:14.517 --> 40:16.102
I don't have any missed calls.

40:16.118 --> 40:19.232
Oh, wait, there's a little envelope
thingy in the bottom corner.

40:19.245 --> 40:20.332
Get out of town.

40:20.346 --> 40:22.962
It went directly to my saved messages.
Why would it do that?

40:22.977 --> 40:25.932
- I couldn't tell you.
- Ooh, wow.

40:25.947 --> 40:28.443
Whoa, yours is really good.

40:28.485 --> 40:30.822
Okay, well, sorry to wake you.

40:30.835 --> 40:32.351
I'll talk to you
in a few hours.

40:32.368 --> 40:34.171
Whoa, wait a minute.
Where do you think you're going?

40:34.206 --> 40:35.512
Um, to sleep?

40:35.528 --> 40:37.692
No, I don't think so.
You woke me up.

40:37.708 --> 40:38.962
I'm up. Text me back.

40:38.975 --> 40:40.671
You want me to
text you back now?

40:40.687 --> 40:42.013
You started this.

40:42.025 --> 40:45.063
I know,
but I don't have my books with me.

40:45.075 --> 40:46.601
You don't need your books, Ace.

40:46.616 --> 40:49.122
- Logan --
- I miss you, Rory.

40:49.135 --> 40:50.961
- You do?
- Yeah.

40:50.977 --> 40:52.653
I miss you, too.

40:52.665 --> 40:54.823
I can't text you with
you on the phone.

40:54.835 --> 40:56.060
Okay, so hang up.

40:56.078 --> 40:58.220
- I'm gonna hang up now.
- Okay.

40:58.448 --> 41:01.540
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

41:36.866 --> 41:38.542
Hi, Chris.
