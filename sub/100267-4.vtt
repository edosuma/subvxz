00:13.222 --> 00:15.758
You were havin' happy hour
with your pals the other day...

00:16.593 --> 00:18.461
WAYNE: Bottoms up,
super chieftains.

00:21.564 --> 00:23.165
DAN: Did yous ever wonder
why we tap the glasses twice?

00:23.199 --> 00:24.601
‐Two'll do ya.
‐I always thought we should tap

00:24.634 --> 00:25.702
three times like in wrasslin'.

00:25.735 --> 00:26.603
That's how
they finish the match.

00:26.636 --> 00:28.805
I prefer throwin' hands
to wrasslin'.

00:28.838 --> 00:30.339
You don't like
sports entertainment, Wayne?

00:30.372 --> 00:32.575
I got a wee bit of time
for sports entertainment.

00:32.609 --> 00:34.577
‐Mike the Miz.
‐He your favorite?

00:34.611 --> 00:36.245
If you could name
your favorite wrestler,

00:36.278 --> 00:37.647
I will assume
you want to fuck them.

00:37.680 --> 00:39.816
‐Alexa Bliss.
‐There ya go.

00:39.849 --> 00:42.451
Actually, (MIMICKING HULK HOGAN)

00:42.485 --> 00:44.487
It's well documented
that I'm a Hulkster fan,

Brother...

00:46.388 --> 00:47.590
Who's your favorite, Dan?

00:48.825 --> 00:50.460
‐I'm listening.
‐Trish Stratus.

00:50.493 --> 00:51.828
For what reason?
'Cause she's Canadian?

00:51.861 --> 00:53.463
I can think of a couple
big'ol reasons.

00:53.496 --> 00:54.531
‐Like what?
‐Well...

00:54.564 --> 00:56.232
Her athleticisms
and integrities.

00:56.265 --> 00:58.067
Wanna know what, I'm not
gonna say he's my favorite,

00:58.100 --> 00:59.301
for reasons aforementioned,

00:59.335 --> 01:00.637
but it's Bret the Hitman Hart.

01:00.670 --> 01:01.804
The whole fuckin'
Hart Foundation

01:01.838 --> 01:03.072
are really good Canadian boys.

01:03.105 --> 01:05.341
I once put my little cousint
into a sharpshooter for calling

01:05.374 --> 01:07.409
Bret the Hitman Hart,
Bret the Hitman Fart.

01:07.443 --> 01:08.478
I always had dreams
of becoming

01:08.511 --> 01:10.346
a professional wrestler.
But I could never come up

01:10.379 --> 01:11.413
with a good ring names.

01:11.447 --> 01:13.182
‐Dan Dan Bigelow.
‐Macho Dan.

01:13.215 --> 01:15.652
(GIGGLES) Could call ya...
Farty Jannetty.

01:15.685 --> 01:17.453
And then we could be
a tag team like the Rockers.

01:17.487 --> 01:18.721
Oh, that's kind of fun. Okay.

01:18.755 --> 01:20.389
So, if you're gonna be
Farty Jannety,

01:20.422 --> 01:22.191
‐who's Dary?
‐Think Shawn Michaels.

01:22.224 --> 01:23.860
Put a little mustard
on that fuckin' high kick.

01:23.893 --> 01:25.495
Actually, it's called
the Sweet Chin Music.

01:25.528 --> 01:26.563
I know what it's called, Dary.

01:26.596 --> 01:28.397
More like Yawn Michaels.

01:28.430 --> 01:29.431
That was stone cold, Wayne.

01:29.466 --> 01:31.267
DAN: That was a wee bit
Randy Savage, Waynes.

01:31.300 --> 01:32.702
I'm not sure I like
your Attitude Era.

01:32.735 --> 01:34.336
You know what?
This conversation's starting

01:34.370 --> 01:35.705

01:35.738 --> 01:37.339
Who died and made you
Mister Perfect?

01:37.373 --> 01:38.475
Yeah, you're walking around here

01:38.508 --> 01:40.176
like the Big Boss Man sometimes.

01:40.209 --> 01:42.178
I'm gonna come right out and say
it yous two are a bit Rick Rude.

01:42.211 --> 01:43.345
I can't speak for
all of mankind,

01:43.379 --> 01:45.715
but I wish we could get a little
bit more Dude Loves here.

01:45.748 --> 01:49.418
Ha! I'm gonna head to the bar
to play some Jimmy snooker.

01:49.451 --> 01:51.588
Not become a million dollar man
playing billiards.

01:51.621 --> 01:52.589
This is really starting to sound

01:52.622 --> 01:54.724
like a whole lot of
British bullshit to me.

01:54.757 --> 01:56.593
Gettin' a little Rowdy Roddy
Piper over there.

01:56.626 --> 01:58.160
Gettin' a little
Rowdy Ronda Rousey.

01:58.194 --> 01:59.228
Yeah, you gotta be
Koko B. Ware

01:59.261 --> 02:00.162
how you talk
to people sometimes.

02:00.196 --> 02:01.631
You know what? You should
might come at this

02:01.664 --> 02:03.265
from a different Kurt Angle.

02:03.299 --> 02:04.501
Gotten a bit Mean Gene.

02:04.534 --> 02:05.735
Puttin' on a Big Show.

02:05.768 --> 02:08.571
I can't Paul Bearer much more
of this conversation, so...

02:10.607 --> 02:12.374
I'll offer yous
a Jeff Hardy handshake

02:12.408 --> 02:14.376
and be on my fuckin' way.

02:14.410 --> 02:16.245
Like you know they're your
good pals and everything

02:16.278 --> 02:18.548
but they're also,
at the best of times,

02:18.581 --> 02:21.518

that's super gay,

05:12.755 --> 05:14.857

for a dude that's super gay?

Must be nice.

05:25.735 --> 05:27.504
No holding drinks,
just holding dinks.

It's not science.
Just don't get hit.

with contrition

06:36.839 --> 06:38.741
and chagrin

06:38.775 --> 06:41.511
but throughout this journey,
I've lost myself.

06:41.544 --> 06:43.045
That's not really
the end of the world, it it?

06:43.079 --> 06:44.581
STEWART: I am a pacifist.

06:44.614 --> 06:47.717
I oppose war, militarism
and any and all violence.

06:47.750 --> 06:49.652
I will not raise my fist

06:49.686 --> 06:51.020
to another man.

06:51.053 --> 06:52.855
‐Or woman, right?
‐Roald!

the final layer

07:03.700 --> 07:05.968
of the sweet science
to add to my repertoire.

07:06.002 --> 07:07.637
Again.

07:07.670 --> 07:09.672
Never begin a sentence
with again.

07:13.876 --> 07:15.044
It's so uppity.

07:15.077 --> 07:16.613
It's not science.
Just don't get hit.

07:16.646 --> 07:19.516
Rest assured, that's rooted.

07:20.449 --> 07:23.586
And just because I won't
punch my opponent,

07:23.620 --> 07:25.755
doesn't mean I can't finish him.

wrangle her back in.

to one of your cows as "cow?"

08:26.916 --> 08:28.117
Can confirm.

08:28.150 --> 08:30.052
They don't have names?

08:30.086 --> 08:31.921
I know what they look like.
I don't need to name them.

08:31.954 --> 08:33.590
Give 'em names. Show 'em love.

I can say whatever I want.

Yeah, but you're not
expose'ta say gay

20:18.528 --> 20:19.996
when you mean like
stupid or something.

20:20.029 --> 20:21.964
That's awfully presumptuous,
Squirrelly Dan.

20:21.998 --> 20:24.634
Yeah, I'm fairly certain that's
not what he meant, Squirrelly.

20:24.667 --> 20:26.302
Yeah, you gotta stop
being so squirrelly, Dan.

20:26.335 --> 20:29.271
Now look, if I see something
that is, by definition, gay...

20:29.305 --> 20:30.439
What's your definition of gay?

20:30.473 --> 20:33.009
Male dicks penetrating
male butts, for pleasures sake.

20:33.042 --> 20:34.410
Sound definition, good buddy.

20:34.443 --> 20:35.478
For swinging dicks, yeah.

20:35.512 --> 20:37.547
Then I can and will call it gay.

20:37.580 --> 20:38.615
I don't know, good buddies.

20:38.648 --> 20:41.651
What say I see a male dick
penetrating a male butt,

20:41.684 --> 20:43.452
consensually,
for pleasures sake.

20:43.486 --> 20:45.221
