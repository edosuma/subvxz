00:01.068 --> 00:02.601
Roswell is probably

00:02.703 --> 00:06.872
the single most well-known
UFO event in human history.

00:06.974 --> 00:08.674
What people don't realize is

00:08.776 --> 00:11.210
this was not the first crash.

00:11.312 --> 00:14.246
World governments have been collecting

00:14.348 --> 00:18.717
and trying to reverse-engineer
alien technology for decades.

00:18.819 --> 00:21.687
You have to wonder if we've been

00:21.789 --> 00:24.023
purposely given this technology.

00:24.125 --> 00:26.125
Due to retrieving

00:26.227 --> 00:30.662
extraterrestrial technology,
we have reached a level

00:30.765 --> 00:33.265
that put us on our path to the stars.

00:33.367 --> 00:36.902
Since the dawn of civilization,

00:37.004 --> 00:40.973
mankind has credited its origins to gods

00:41.075 --> 00:43.575
and other visitors from the stars.

00:43.677 --> 00:46.278
What if it were true?

00:46.380 --> 00:48.781
Did extraterrestrial beings

00:48.883 --> 00:51.784
really help to shape our history?

00:51.886 --> 00:55.654
And if so, could more evidence be found

00:55.756 --> 00:59.291
by looking beyond Roswell?

Russia's Secret Files
Original Air Date on August 12, 2016

01:32.560 --> 01:34.426
Washington D.C.,

01:34.528 --> 01:37.529
April, 2011.

01:37.631 --> 01:41.867
The FBI releases thousands of files

01:41.969 --> 01:43.802
as part of its online FBI vault.

01:43.904 --> 01:47.306
One particular file draws the attention

01:47.408 --> 01:50.576
of the media
and independent researchers.

01:50.678 --> 01:55.481
The memo, dated March 22, 1950,

01:55.583 --> 01:58.817
is a briefing
to FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover

01:58.919 --> 02:03.489
regarding informant information
about three "flying saucers"

02:03.591 --> 02:06.291
that were recovered in New Mexico.

02:08.696 --> 02:11.697
Investigators immediately
connect the memo

02:11.799 --> 02:14.166
to the infamous Roswell incident:

02:14.268 --> 02:17.302
a purported UFO crash
that many people believe

02:17.404 --> 02:21.073
was covered up by the military in 1947.

02:22.977 --> 02:25.811
But this document is just the latest

02:25.913 --> 02:28.113
in a series of government files

02:28.215 --> 02:30.983
that have been released in recent years,

02:31.085 --> 02:34.419
suggesting there may be more
to the Roswell crash

02:34.522 --> 02:37.856
than the public was told.

02:37.958 --> 02:42.394
As an investigative reporter,
I think what I am amazed by

02:42.496 --> 02:46.798
is how many leaked documents
from the 1940s

02:46.901 --> 02:50.302
have actually come out into the world

02:50.404 --> 02:54.106
and lay out details about
what really happened at Roswell.

02:58.212 --> 03:02.381
On July 4, a rancher named Mac Brazel

03:02.483 --> 03:06.518
finds all kinds of strange
silver debris.

03:06.620 --> 03:11.490
He knows he doesn't understand
what he's walking through.

03:11.592 --> 03:15.127
He decides to go into Roswell
and tell the sheriff,

03:15.229 --> 03:17.462
"Something has crashed on my ranch."

03:20.000 --> 03:22.568
Intel coming out of
Roswell Army Air Field

03:22.670 --> 03:26.338
get assigned to go to the debris field.

03:26.440 --> 03:28.607
And these men are told
that they are to pick up

03:28.709 --> 03:30.909
every single thing
that is in the debris field

03:31.011 --> 03:33.445
on the Mac Brazel ranch.

03:33.547 --> 03:35.714
Everything is to be picked up.

03:36.850 --> 03:39.651
On July 8, 1947,

03:39.753 --> 03:43.388
the headline on the front page
of the Roswell Daily Record

03:43.490 --> 03:47.559
reports that the military
had retrieved a flying saucer.

03:49.563 --> 03:52.598
But the following day,
the official story

03:52.700 --> 03:56.768
is suddenly changed
to suggest it was nothing more

03:56.870 --> 03:58.837
than a failed weather balloon.

04:00.808 --> 04:02.774
Roswell was the home

04:02.876 --> 04:04.309
of the 509th Bomb Crew.

04:04.411 --> 04:07.446
This was the only
atomic bomb-capable squadron

04:07.548 --> 04:08.780
anywhere in the world.

04:08.882 --> 04:10.415
These people were the best of the best.

04:12.686 --> 04:15.887
The idea that intelligence
personnel at this base

04:15.990 --> 04:18.123
would mistake a weather balloon

04:18.225 --> 04:22.694
for something exotic is preposterous.

04:22.796 --> 04:27.366
So that, arguably, is the start
of the UFO cover-up.

04:29.737 --> 04:31.703
Weather balloons, swamp gas,

04:31.805 --> 04:33.138
meteorite-- it doesn't matter.

04:33.240 --> 04:36.208
It's always something else but a UFO.

04:37.378 --> 04:40.579
The Roswell crash was covered up.

04:40.681 --> 04:42.714
The fact that they retracted the story

04:42.816 --> 04:46.351
of having captured
a flying saucer, in my opinion,

04:46.453 --> 04:51.390
it was quick PR damage control.

04:51.492 --> 04:54.426
The world was told,
"Nope, just a weather balloon."

04:54.528 --> 04:57.996
And for more than 30 years,
that's where it was left,

04:58.098 --> 05:01.867
until witnesses started to surface,

05:01.969 --> 05:05.504
saying, no, it was actually
an extraterrestrial craft.

05:05.606 --> 05:08.507
And that people saw alien bodies.

05:12.980 --> 05:15.914
In April of 2014,

05:16.016 --> 05:19.151
ancient astronaut theorist
Giorgio Tsoukalos

05:19.253 --> 05:21.086
traveled to Walker Air Force Base

05:21.188 --> 05:22.821
in Roswell, New Mexico,

05:22.923 --> 05:26.725
to meet with the city's mayor,
Del Jurney,

05:26.827 --> 05:28.727
and to get a rare look at the hangar

05:28.829 --> 05:31.963
where the Roswell wreckage
and extraterrestrial bodies

05:32.066 --> 05:34.099
were allegedly first taken.

05:39.940 --> 05:42.507
Wow.

05:42.609 --> 05:43.709
This is huge.

05:43.811 --> 05:46.111
So what do you think?

05:46.213 --> 05:47.846
Man, I have goose bumps right now.

05:47.948 --> 05:49.414
I mean, we're walking on history here.

05:49.516 --> 05:50.782
It's amazing, isn't it?

05:50.884 --> 05:52.351
Are you familiar with where the spot is,

05:52.453 --> 05:53.685
where they actually put them?

05:53.787 --> 05:55.454
Well, you know,
the information that I have

05:55.556 --> 05:57.456
says that it's probably
right over here in the corner.

05:57.558 --> 05:59.057
Uh, they took them over there,

05:59.159 --> 06:00.859
did an examination of the bodies.

06:03.097 --> 06:04.463
So this is where it was.

06:04.565 --> 06:06.531
This is it. Yeah, come on in.

06:09.770 --> 06:12.604
They had the debris out here
in the hangar area

06:12.706 --> 06:14.806
and they bring the bodies
inside this room.

06:17.044 --> 06:18.443
I really don't know what to say,

06:18.545 --> 06:20.212
'cause, I mean, if this was it...

06:20.314 --> 06:21.747
-You're standing where...
-In it, yeah.

06:21.849 --> 06:26.084
...where extraterrestrial beings
might have been.

06:29.056 --> 06:31.990
Where did the debris go?
Where did it end up?

06:32.092 --> 06:33.825
Well, it ended up
with the government, of course.

06:33.927 --> 06:35.127
Uh, my understanding is

06:35.229 --> 06:38.130
that they took the bodies to
Wright Patterson Air Force Base,

06:38.232 --> 06:40.432
certainly probably took
the debris as well,

06:40.534 --> 06:42.434
and have it well preserved

06:42.536 --> 06:45.070
in a military installation someplace.

06:47.841 --> 06:50.075
Roswell researchers suggest

06:50.177 --> 06:52.811
a government-sanctioned bond of secrecy

06:52.913 --> 06:55.981
has prevented witnesses
of the crash and retrieval

06:56.083 --> 06:58.784
from coming forward publicly.

06:58.886 --> 07:02.287
But many did choose
to come forward later in life,

07:02.389 --> 07:04.990
including the first military officer

07:05.092 --> 07:10.028
to arrive at the Roswell
crash site, Major Jesse Marcel.

07:10.130 --> 07:11.930
According to his grandson,

07:12.032 --> 07:15.834
Marcel privately shared
many details of his experience

07:15.936 --> 07:17.536
with the family.

07:17.638 --> 07:19.938
My grandfather, Major Jesse Marcel,

07:20.040 --> 07:22.107
was the head of intelligence
for the 509th bombing group.

07:22.209 --> 07:25.010
As a kid, basically
around the dinner table,

07:25.112 --> 07:26.178
we talked about Roswell.

07:26.280 --> 07:29.114
And through conversations,

07:29.216 --> 07:32.651
we learned that my grandfather
was the lead investigator

07:32.753 --> 07:35.654
into what has become known as
the Roswell incident.

07:35.756 --> 07:37.456
And when he was looking at the debris,

07:37.558 --> 07:38.857
he couldn't make heads or tails

07:38.959 --> 07:40.759
or any sense
out of what he was looking at.

07:40.861 --> 07:42.194
He had gathered some of the debris

07:42.296 --> 07:44.196
and decided to take it home with him.

07:44.298 --> 07:46.031
He kind of came to this idea
that, he said,

07:46.133 --> 07:48.133
"You know, whatever this stuff
is, it's very significant

07:48.235 --> 07:49.601
"and it's gonna change humanity,

07:49.703 --> 07:52.037
"and I want my family
to be a part of it.

07:52.139 --> 07:53.238
This is very important."

07:55.042 --> 07:56.908
According to the family's story,

07:57.010 --> 08:00.645
Major Marcel came home after
his first visit to the site

08:00.747 --> 08:04.382
and laid the debris out
on the floor of their kitchen.

08:04.485 --> 08:07.752
Some of the material was
a strange thin metal

08:07.855 --> 08:11.756
similar to foil, except when
crumpled up into a ball,

08:11.859 --> 08:15.026
it would bounce back
to its flawless state.

08:16.763 --> 08:20.665
Marcel also claims the metal
was not the same material

08:20.767 --> 08:22.767
featured in newspaper photographs

08:22.870 --> 08:25.237
being held by his grandfather.

08:25.339 --> 08:27.772
There's a pretty famous picture of him

08:27.875 --> 08:28.940
holding a piece of debris,

08:29.042 --> 08:30.675
which is a piece of foil basically,

08:30.777 --> 08:32.277
and it was weather balloon material.

08:32.379 --> 08:35.113
He begrudgingly went along
with the story, held it.

08:35.215 --> 08:36.815
And if you take a look at that,

08:36.917 --> 08:38.717
you'll notice that he's not
looking at the camera.

08:38.818 --> 08:42.486
He's looking up at somebody
barking him orders.

08:42.589 --> 08:43.955
He fell in line, uh, begrudgingly,

08:44.057 --> 08:45.790
and did what he was supposed to do.

08:46.860 --> 08:49.728
Is it possible that an alien craft

08:49.830 --> 08:51.963
really did crash in Roswell?

08:54.067 --> 08:57.168
And if so, might there be
a larger conspiracy

08:57.271 --> 09:00.205
that goes beyond New Mexico?

09:00.307 --> 09:03.808
Ancient astronaut theorists say yes,

09:03.911 --> 09:06.244
but they also believe that Roswell

09:06.346 --> 09:12.083
was not the first, or only,
extraterrestrial crash on Earth.

09:18.800 --> 09:20.400
NARRATOR Cape Girardeau, Missouri.

09:20.502 --> 09:23.370
April 12, 1941.

09:23.472 --> 09:25.238
9:30 p.m.

09:25.340 --> 09:28.041
(phone ringing)

09:28.143 --> 09:32.078
Reverend William Huffman
gets a call from local police

09:32.180 --> 09:34.447
informing him that
there has been a crash

09:34.549 --> 09:36.149
and he is needed at the site

09:36.251 --> 09:39.919
to offer spiritual comfort
to the victims.

09:40.022 --> 09:41.154
He probably thought

09:41.256 --> 09:42.889
it was gonna be an automobile crash.

09:42.991 --> 09:44.557
But to his surprise, when he arrived,

09:44.660 --> 09:47.327
there is a disc-shaped craft,

09:47.429 --> 09:51.498
and there are three alien
looking bodies on the ground--

09:51.600 --> 09:56.469
tiny, big heads, big eyes, small mouths.

09:56.571 --> 09:59.906
The military
was there, the FBI was there.

10:00.008 --> 10:01.308
And he was astonished to find

10:01.410 --> 10:04.377
that this was a crash
of some kind of UFO,

10:04.479 --> 10:07.681
and that the being was
an extraterrestrial.

10:07.783 --> 10:11.351
He had the chance
to look inside the disc,

10:11.453 --> 10:15.088
and found that there were
hieroglyphic type inscriptions

10:15.190 --> 10:16.489
on the walls inside.

10:16.591 --> 10:18.124
The government told him,

10:18.226 --> 10:20.627
"You're not to say a word
about this to anyone.

10:20.729 --> 10:22.696
This is totally classified."

10:24.700 --> 10:26.966
Huffman's account would remain a secret

10:27.069 --> 10:28.368
until after his passing,

10:28.470 --> 10:32.739
when his wife, on her deathbed in 1984,

10:32.841 --> 10:36.609
divulged the details
to the rest of the family.

10:36.712 --> 10:39.479
Witnesses have since come forward

10:39.581 --> 10:43.450
to corroborate the account,
including the sheriff's brother

10:43.552 --> 10:45.385
and members of the fire department.

10:45.487 --> 10:48.621
Further details
about the military response

10:48.724 --> 10:50.123
have since been leaked,

10:50.225 --> 10:53.226
and the incident has become known as

10:53.328 --> 10:57.197
"The Bombshell Before Roswell."

10:57.299 --> 11:01.968
The story is that a military
unit from Sikeston, Missouri,

11:02.070 --> 11:04.704
only about 30 miles away
from the crash site,

11:04.806 --> 11:09.109
comes in, with orders
to gather up these bodies,

11:09.211 --> 11:13.079
gather up this disc
and fly it to Washington D.C.

11:14.750 --> 11:18.418
So, Cape Girardeau, Missouri,

11:18.520 --> 11:22.555
from 1941, appears to be where

11:22.657 --> 11:27.026
our retrieval, as a government,
of things that were described

11:27.129 --> 11:30.697
as "from another world" began.

11:30.799 --> 11:34.234
The Cape Girardeau crash
was a preparation

11:34.336 --> 11:37.370
for the military's response
to the Roswell crash.

11:37.472 --> 11:40.306
And the military learned an awful lot

11:40.409 --> 11:42.308
about how to handle these events

11:42.411 --> 11:45.445
and how to make sure that
they put a blanket of secrecy

11:45.547 --> 11:47.514
over future crash events.

11:50.685 --> 11:52.385
While the Roswell crash

11:52.487 --> 11:55.221
is now infamous, what is lesser known

11:55.323 --> 11:59.292
is that similar incidents
were reported all across America

11:59.394 --> 12:01.528
around the same time.

12:01.630 --> 12:03.096
These incidents

12:03.198 --> 12:07.500
include crashes
in San Antonio, New Mexico;

12:07.602 --> 12:09.569
Twin Falls, Idaho;

12:09.671 --> 12:12.172
Hebgen Lake, Montana;

12:12.274 --> 12:15.442
Braxton County, West Virginia;

12:15.544 --> 12:18.077
and many others.

12:18.180 --> 12:21.281
But why were so many mysterious crashes

12:21.383 --> 12:23.583
suddenly being reported?

12:28.924 --> 12:31.724
Many believe the defining event
of the 20th century

12:31.827 --> 12:33.593
was World War II.

12:33.695 --> 12:34.928
It was a conflict

12:35.030 --> 12:37.363
that would involve
nearly every nation on Earth

12:37.466 --> 12:41.267
and cost the lives
of over 60 million people.

12:44.973 --> 12:49.776
The war gave rise to weaponry
far more advanced and deadly

12:49.878 --> 12:53.780
than modern man had ever known,
including the atomic bomb.

12:56.751 --> 13:01.354
It also gave rise to a
tremendous surge in UFO reports.

13:01.456 --> 13:03.256
But why?

13:03.358 --> 13:07.794
A large portion
of these alleged UFO sightings

13:07.896 --> 13:11.531
have occurred in the decades
during World War II

13:11.633 --> 13:13.733
and immediately afterwards.

13:13.835 --> 13:17.637
And part of the theory there is that,

13:17.739 --> 13:22.475
because the United States
had developed atomic weapons,

13:22.577 --> 13:24.277
and used them on Japan...

13:26.715 --> 13:30.149
...and then continued to test
them in Nevada, New Mexico

13:30.252 --> 13:31.451
and other areas,

13:31.553 --> 13:33.253
that the extraterrestrials themselves

13:33.355 --> 13:35.622
were very concerned about this.

13:35.724 --> 13:37.690
Some have suggested that

13:37.792 --> 13:42.195
the moment that we developed
nuclear capabilities,

13:42.297 --> 13:45.331
that this somehow signaled
the extraterrestrials

13:45.433 --> 13:49.035
that we have reached
a level of technology.

13:49.137 --> 13:51.804
Because one thing can be said for sure:

13:51.907 --> 13:56.209
that worldwide, the eyewitness accounts

13:56.311 --> 13:59.312
or reports for UFO sightings
have gone up

13:59.414 --> 14:02.882
ever since the deployment
of our first hydrogen bomb.

14:02.984 --> 14:07.220
So, is it possible
that we, by doing that,

14:07.322 --> 14:11.024
signaled extraterrestrial life
out there?

14:12.294 --> 14:14.394
CHILDRESS:. You have to wonder
what was going on,

14:14.496 --> 14:17.830
because various UFO crashes

14:17.933 --> 14:21.267
were allegedly happening
throughout North America

14:21.369 --> 14:23.770
in the late '40s, '50s and '60s.

14:26.775 --> 14:29.375
Did the dawning of the nuclear age

14:29.477 --> 14:34.013
really usher in a new era
of extraterrestrial encounters?

14:35.684 --> 14:37.483
And if the U.S. military

14:37.586 --> 14:40.687
was actively retrieving UFO wreckage,

14:40.789 --> 14:43.289
just where were they taking it?

14:46.361 --> 14:48.328
Groom Lake, Nevada.

14:48.430 --> 14:52.265
Just 900 miles from Roswell, New Mexico.

14:52.367 --> 14:54.701
Perhaps the most well-known site

14:54.803 --> 14:57.236
rumored to be hiding alien debris

14:57.339 --> 15:02.775
is the secret engineering base
known as Area 51.

15:02.877 --> 15:05.745
After years of denying its existence,

15:05.847 --> 15:10.483
on August 16, 2013,
the United States government

15:10.585 --> 15:12.719
officially acknowledged the base.

15:14.356 --> 15:18.825
It was one of the single most sensitive

15:18.927 --> 15:20.994
hidden military bases.

15:21.096 --> 15:25.398
Everybody who worked there
was sworn to secrecy, to death.

15:25.500 --> 15:29.102
And it was not until 2013

15:29.204 --> 15:33.539
that there was a confirmation
that Area 51 is real

15:33.642 --> 15:36.909
and had been real for a very long time.

15:38.947 --> 15:41.047
Believed by many to hold the wreckage

15:41.149 --> 15:44.751
from the infamous Roswell crash of 1947,

15:44.853 --> 15:48.955
the U.S. government still claims
the secret engineering base

15:49.057 --> 15:53.393
has never housed
any extraterrestrial remains.

15:53.495 --> 15:55.628
The announcement seems to have been

15:55.730 --> 15:57.530
tossing the public a bone,

15:57.632 --> 16:01.200
that we indeed have an area

16:01.302 --> 16:03.603
of advanced research and development,

16:03.705 --> 16:07.240
and what we refer to as Area 51.

16:07.342 --> 16:09.876
Who knows what's really going on there?

16:09.978 --> 16:13.312
Just because they said this,
that or the other thing

16:13.415 --> 16:15.515
doesn't mean it's true.

16:15.617 --> 16:17.517
And would anybody trust the CIA

16:17.619 --> 16:21.054
to tell the truth, the whole
truth and nothing but the truth?

16:21.156 --> 16:24.590
When you listen to people
who have left Area 51,

16:24.693 --> 16:27.927
they claim that it's got
extraterrestrial craft

16:28.029 --> 16:30.163
that we have tested
and reverse-engineered.

16:30.265 --> 16:34.600
There's no question in my mind
that Area 51 has been

16:34.703 --> 16:39.005
a very secretive government base
for all kinds of things.

16:39.107 --> 16:43.076
Is it possible that Area 51

16:43.178 --> 16:46.679
actually houses otherworldly artifacts--

16:46.781 --> 16:51.484
artifacts that were retrieved
from extraterrestrial crashes?

16:51.586 --> 16:54.987
Ancient astronaut theorists say yes,

16:55.090 --> 16:58.458
and suggest that even more
evidence can be found

16:58.560 --> 17:02.562
by examining some of mankind's
latest, and most extraordinary,

17:02.664 --> 17:05.198
technological advancements.

17:07.476 --> 17:10.477
NARRATOR July, 1997.

17:10.579 --> 17:13.579
On the 50th anniversary
of the Roswell incident,

17:13.682 --> 17:17.717
retired United States Colonel
Philip J. Corso

17:17.819 --> 17:21.621
publishes his book
The Day After Roswell.

17:21.723 --> 17:24.223
In it, he not only confirms

17:24.326 --> 17:28.528
that an extraterrestrial craft
crashed in Roswell,

17:28.630 --> 17:31.698
but also that the wreckage
had been secretly collected

17:31.800 --> 17:35.068
and stashed
by the United States military.

17:37.172 --> 17:39.606
Philip J. Corso
was a lieutenant colonel, uh,

17:39.708 --> 17:43.143
in the United States Army,
who had a long

17:43.245 --> 17:45.912
and actually very successful
career in the military;

17:46.014 --> 17:47.113
he was highly decorated.

17:47.215 --> 17:49.082
And in The Day After Roswell,

17:49.184 --> 17:51.751
he made an incredible claim

17:51.853 --> 17:53.820
that he worked at
the Foreign Technology division

17:53.922 --> 17:56.723
within the Army Research
and Development,

17:56.825 --> 18:01.594
and had key access to E.T. technology

18:01.697 --> 18:04.898
from the Roswell crash.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.233
According to Colonel Corso's account,

18:07.336 --> 18:09.669
military scientists and engineers

18:09.771 --> 18:14.441
tried for years to make sense of
the debris collected at Roswell,

18:14.543 --> 18:16.343
but were unsuccessful.

18:18.347 --> 18:21.681
Colonel Philip Corso claimed

18:21.783 --> 18:26.286
that part of his duties on the
Army's Foreign Technology desk

18:26.388 --> 18:29.389
was to take extraterrestrial technology

18:29.491 --> 18:31.558
recovered from the crash at Roswell

18:31.660 --> 18:34.894
and without disclosing
the source of this,

18:34.996 --> 18:36.830
in other words, not-not letting on

18:36.932 --> 18:38.298
that this was extraterrestrial,

18:38.400 --> 18:43.269
was to get this into the hands
of scientists

18:43.372 --> 18:45.638
with some of the big U.S. corporations.

18:48.577 --> 18:50.543
In his book, Colonel Corso stated

18:50.645 --> 18:53.646
that he seeded the alien
materials and information

18:53.749 --> 18:58.284
to high-tech companies
under the guise that it was

18:58.387 --> 19:02.355
recently acquired foreign technology.

19:02.457 --> 19:04.624
What Corso described in his book

19:04.726 --> 19:07.827
was that they would
identify corporations

19:07.929 --> 19:11.998
that had already made
breakthroughs in certain areas,

19:12.100 --> 19:15.902
and so he was giving them
kind of strategic inspiration

19:16.004 --> 19:18.104
in what direction they should operate

19:18.206 --> 19:20.707
in order to be able
to successfully develop

19:20.809 --> 19:22.342
those advanced technologies.

19:25.213 --> 19:27.647
Only after the Roswell crash

19:27.749 --> 19:31.818
did companies like IBM
all of a sudden flourish.

19:31.920 --> 19:34.854
And the reason why
IBM flourished is because

19:34.956 --> 19:38.124
they just happened to be at the
right place at the right time,

19:38.226 --> 19:39.993
that were given the assignment

19:40.095 --> 19:42.595
to reverse-engineer
some of these things.

19:46.635 --> 19:49.536
According to Colonel Corso's account,

19:49.638 --> 19:51.638
night vision was engineered

19:51.740 --> 19:55.108
from the lens on an eye
of an extraterrestrial pilot.

19:57.145 --> 20:01.981
Kevlar came from
studying alien space suits.

20:02.083 --> 20:05.785
And integrated circuits were developed

20:05.887 --> 20:08.221
from their spacecraft's control panel.

20:13.795 --> 20:15.161
Isn't it interesting

20:15.263 --> 20:18.498
that after the 1947 crash
in Roswell, New Mexico,

20:18.600 --> 20:23.036
our technology took off
just like a rocket?

20:25.106 --> 20:28.975
Silicon chips and all kinds
of other technology,

20:29.077 --> 20:31.945
laser technology, fiber optics--

20:32.047 --> 20:36.883
all of this stuff came right after 1947,

20:36.985 --> 20:39.786
when Roswell crashed.

20:39.888 --> 20:43.056
PAUL HELLYER: The Day After
Roswell is a real thing.

20:43.158 --> 20:46.993
I recognized the names of
the generals and the airfields

20:47.095 --> 20:49.562
that he was talking about
from my days in defense.

20:49.664 --> 20:52.198
So, this was not new territory for me.

20:52.300 --> 20:55.101
And, uh, I spoke to a general.

20:55.203 --> 20:57.437
He said, "Every word is true and more."

20:57.539 --> 21:01.174
Colonel Corso would also claim

21:01.276 --> 21:04.410
that the reverse-engineering
of various downed alien crafts

21:04.513 --> 21:07.113
was not limited to the United States,

21:07.215 --> 21:09.649
but was happening worldwide.

21:09.751 --> 21:12.585
And the funding for
the research and development

21:12.687 --> 21:15.221
of this extraterrestrial technology

21:15.323 --> 21:17.624
required an elaborate ruse.

21:17.726 --> 21:21.261
A ruse that would
also function as a distraction

21:21.363 --> 21:23.963
from increased UFO sightings:

21:24.065 --> 21:26.232
the Cold War.

21:26.334 --> 21:28.701
The Cold War

21:28.803 --> 21:30.203
was never really a war.

21:30.305 --> 21:33.840
It was an agreement between
Russia and the United States

21:33.942 --> 21:37.043
that we're gonna give the public
something else to worry about:

21:37.145 --> 21:39.445
atomic bombs falling onto their heads,

21:39.548 --> 21:42.715
rather to think about
UFOs and flying saucers.

21:44.486 --> 21:45.985
During the Cold War,

21:46.087 --> 21:48.922
when Russia was supposedly our enemy,

21:49.024 --> 21:50.790
we had a joint military base,

21:50.892 --> 21:52.992
at the South Pole, with the Russians.

21:53.094 --> 21:57.363
And we had a joint space base
with the Russians, too.

21:57.465 --> 22:02.268
So you have to ask:
what was going on here?

22:02.370 --> 22:04.871
I believe governments
all across this planet

22:04.973 --> 22:09.108
have been hiding the knowledge
of extraterrestrial visitations

22:09.210 --> 22:11.277
and crashes on this planet.

22:11.379 --> 22:13.012
They're not telling us the truth.

22:13.114 --> 22:15.048
We've had crashes in Russia.

22:15.150 --> 22:17.717
We've had crashes
in Roswell, New Mexico.

22:17.819 --> 22:20.453
We've had a crash
in Cape Girardeau, Missouri.

22:20.555 --> 22:24.090
It's happening all over this planet.

22:24.192 --> 22:26.426
The big question is: why?

22:29.297 --> 22:31.731
Is it possible that the retrieval

22:31.833 --> 22:35.234
and reverse-engineering
of downed alien spacecraft

22:35.337 --> 22:37.904
goes far beyond Roswell?

22:38.006 --> 22:41.274
And might the Cold War and space race

22:41.376 --> 22:44.611
have provided a cover
to justify innovations

22:44.713 --> 22:47.547
derived from
extraterrestrial technology?

22:49.918 --> 22:52.118
Ancient astronaut theorists say yes,

22:52.220 --> 22:56.589
and suggest that further
evidence can be found

22:56.691 --> 23:00.193
by examining what some
researchers refer to as

23:00.295 --> 23:02.795
"The Russian Roswell".

23:04.433 --> 23:07.100
Astrakhan Oblast, Russia.

23:07.202 --> 23:09.469
500 miles south of Moscow.

23:09.571 --> 23:13.807
June 19, 1948.

23:13.909 --> 23:16.977
11 months after the Roswell incident,

23:17.079 --> 23:21.081
at the Soviet military rocketry
research and development base

23:21.183 --> 23:22.716
Kapustin Yar,

23:22.818 --> 23:25.218
erratic blips
appear on the radar screens.

23:25.321 --> 23:28.088
(radar beeping)

23:28.190 --> 23:31.525
At the same time,
a MiG jet fighter pilot

23:31.627 --> 23:34.494
sees an unidentifiable
cigar-shaped object

23:34.596 --> 23:36.563
flying in front of him.

23:36.665 --> 23:38.498
What we have now come to understand

23:38.600 --> 23:42.502
is that there was an engagement
of the Soviet military

23:42.604 --> 23:46.273
with an unknown object
that came into the airspace

23:46.375 --> 23:47.974
at, or near, Kapustin Yar.

23:48.077 --> 23:53.013
And a Soviet MiG fighter was
scrambled to intercept.

23:54.483 --> 23:58.118
The aircraft engages
in a three-minute dogfight

23:58.220 --> 23:59.886
with the UFO.

23:59.988 --> 24:02.756
The jet was able to fire off a missile.

24:02.858 --> 24:05.325
And the missile apparently hit the craft

24:05.427 --> 24:07.494
just as the craft hit the MiG

24:07.596 --> 24:09.996
with some kind of
blinding flash of light

24:10.099 --> 24:12.866
that caused the MiG,
with the UFO, to crash.

24:17.673 --> 24:19.906
When people talk about UFO crashes,

24:20.008 --> 24:21.308
they talk about Roswell

24:21.410 --> 24:23.076
as if it's the only time
it ever happened,

24:23.178 --> 24:25.612
but it's happened repeatedly.

24:25.714 --> 24:29.015
Kapustin Yar is another great example

24:29.118 --> 24:32.986
of a genuine Roswell type crash,
this time in the Soviet Union,

24:33.088 --> 24:36.957
and totally classified under the
umbrella of national security.

24:37.059 --> 24:40.961
There are special teams designed
to create a cover story.

24:41.063 --> 24:44.931
And the wreckage goes off to warehouses

24:45.033 --> 24:49.336
in which that technology
is analyzed and understood.

24:53.375 --> 24:55.475
Rumors have circulated for years

24:55.577 --> 24:58.245
that nearly a quarter-mile
beneath the surface

24:58.347 --> 25:02.015
of the Kapustin Yar base
are hallways and chambers

25:02.117 --> 25:04.918
containing downed extraterrestrial craft

25:05.020 --> 25:08.922
and rooms where alien autopsies
have been performed.

25:14.363 --> 25:17.431
This is really
the Soviet Union's Area 51.

25:17.533 --> 25:19.900
It was very, very remote.

25:20.002 --> 25:22.469
The Soviets did all of
their major rocket testing,

25:22.571 --> 25:25.338
a lot of their advanced back-
engineering of Nazi technology

25:25.441 --> 25:26.873
from World War II.

25:26.975 --> 25:29.109
This is a very,
very sophisticated place.

25:31.146 --> 25:33.480
Some people came up with the idea

25:33.582 --> 25:35.549
that this was the main storage

25:35.651 --> 25:37.851
of the crashed UFOs in the Soviet Union

25:37.953 --> 25:41.188
and the secret tests
are being done there.

25:43.592 --> 25:46.326
Curiously, at this secret facility,

25:46.428 --> 25:49.062
the Soviets developed
better nuclear weapons

25:49.164 --> 25:51.498
and delivery systems in 18 months

25:51.600 --> 25:55.802
than they had anticipated
creating in five years.

26:00.209 --> 26:02.709
In 1959,

26:02.811 --> 26:04.711
the United States
Central Intelligence Agency

26:04.813 --> 26:08.949
began to monitor the covert base
and collect aerial photographs

26:09.051 --> 26:12.419
from a U-2 reconnaissance mission.

26:12.521 --> 26:16.423
When the United States
sent recon missions over there

26:16.525 --> 26:18.124
during the Cold War, they looked down

26:18.227 --> 26:22.229
and they saw these incredible
carved images on the ground

26:22.331 --> 26:23.563
around Kapustin Yar.

26:25.767 --> 26:28.068
When we actually look at the depictions

26:28.170 --> 26:29.803
of these geoglyphs,

26:29.905 --> 26:33.974
they look similar to what we see
in crop circles

26:34.076 --> 26:37.677
and in certain ancient landforms
visible on Earth.

26:37.779 --> 26:39.779
So there clearly appears
to have been an attempt

26:39.882 --> 26:41.882
to communicate
with the extraterrestrials,

26:41.984 --> 26:44.150
perhaps saying, "X marks the spot.

26:44.253 --> 26:45.986
Come here, guys."

26:46.088 --> 26:48.989
Kapustin Yar was one of
the former Soviet Union's

26:49.091 --> 26:50.657
most secretive air bases.

26:50.759 --> 26:52.125
The rumor is, is they were

26:52.227 --> 26:54.494
researching UFO technology there.

26:54.596 --> 26:56.062
And one wonders if it's possible

26:56.164 --> 26:59.432
if those symbols were, in fact,
used to attract UFOs.

27:03.138 --> 27:05.438
According to
ancient astronaut theorists,

27:05.541 --> 27:10.744
this so-called "Russian Roswell"
isn't the only site of its kind.

27:10.846 --> 27:14.447
In the middle of Australia
lies the military base,

27:14.550 --> 27:16.349
Pine Gap.

27:16.451 --> 27:18.518
Located in an area

27:18.620 --> 27:21.788
that has long been associated
with UFO activity,

27:21.890 --> 27:25.625
the facility is said to extend
five miles underground

27:25.727 --> 27:28.361
and is rumored to have been used

27:28.463 --> 27:30.997
for researching
electromagnetic propulsion

27:31.099 --> 27:33.466
since the 1960s.

27:34.636 --> 27:36.636
In the remote hills of China,

27:36.738 --> 27:39.272
there are a series of bizarre runways

27:39.374 --> 27:44.244
over a mile long
and over a half mile wide.

27:44.346 --> 27:47.547
Researchers
have spotted strange aircraft

27:47.649 --> 27:49.349
parked along the runways

27:49.451 --> 27:51.985
and believe it is the testing ground

27:52.087 --> 27:55.555
for extraterrestrial spacecraft.

27:55.657 --> 27:58.825
And at the Royal Air Force's
Rudloe Manor,

27:58.927 --> 28:02.429
located in the countryside
of Wiltshire, England,

28:02.531 --> 28:05.298
many believe
the British Ministry of Defence

28:05.400 --> 28:10.170
has been storing crashed UFOs
since the 1950s.

28:11.773 --> 28:13.673
With the existence
of all of these places

28:13.775 --> 28:15.709
around the world, it suggests

28:15.811 --> 28:18.578
that world governments
have been collecting

28:18.680 --> 28:22.716
and trying to reverse-engineer
alien technology for decades.

28:24.286 --> 28:27.287
Is it possible that not only Area 51,

28:27.389 --> 28:31.558
but also other secret military
sites across the globe,

28:31.660 --> 28:35.028
contain extraterrestrial artifacts?

28:35.130 --> 28:39.599
And if so, how is it
that so many UFO crashes

28:39.701 --> 28:42.202
occurred at roughly
the same time period,

28:42.304 --> 28:45.972
and scattered
across multiple continents?

28:48.010 --> 28:49.843
You kind of have to wonder

28:49.945 --> 28:52.679
if the extraterrestrials realized that

28:52.781 --> 28:54.781
conflict throughout our planet

28:54.883 --> 28:58.718
does actually help us develop

28:58.820 --> 29:01.388
better aerospace and other technology.

29:01.490 --> 29:06.393
And so it would seem that,
with these various UFO crashes

29:06.495 --> 29:08.928
that were allegedly happening
all over the world,

29:09.031 --> 29:12.699
these extraterrestrials are purposely

29:12.801 --> 29:15.769
trying to advance us forward.

29:19.207 --> 29:21.541
Maybe a lot of
what we were dealing with,

29:21.643 --> 29:25.178
including some of the crashes
in the '40s and the '50s,

29:25.280 --> 29:29.549
might have been planned
to put certain technologies

29:29.651 --> 29:34.320
in human hands to start a process

29:34.423 --> 29:38.258
in which humans would begin
to try to develop technology.

29:40.362 --> 29:43.129
I had a friend that
was involved in the research

29:43.231 --> 29:48.835
of trying to back-engineer
the UFO propulsion.

29:48.937 --> 29:50.970
The information that we've gotten

29:51.073 --> 29:55.642
from these craft is
way too advanced for us to copy.

29:55.744 --> 29:57.510
They're using materials

29:57.612 --> 30:00.447
that are unobtainable on Earth,

30:00.549 --> 30:02.482
or anywhere in this solar system.

30:05.687 --> 30:08.254
With the collapse of the Soviet Union

30:08.356 --> 30:11.991
and the end of the Cold War
in the early 1990s,

30:12.094 --> 30:15.295
there were many who believed
that the development

30:15.397 --> 30:20.133
of alien technology would
no longer be kept a secret.

30:20.235 --> 30:23.570
Unfortunately, this was not the case.

30:25.207 --> 30:26.973
When the Cold War ended,

30:27.075 --> 30:30.643
the truth embargo,
which is what it was and is,

30:30.746 --> 30:32.345
should've been lifted,

30:32.447 --> 30:35.048
and the public should've been
brought into the situation

30:35.150 --> 30:37.450
and should've been told
what was going on.

30:37.552 --> 30:41.821
It is taxpayers' money who have
financed all of this stuff.

30:45.594 --> 30:49.229
Was the Cold War
really an orchestrated event

30:49.331 --> 30:51.598
intended to serve as a smoke screen

30:51.700 --> 30:55.935
for governments to harvest
extraterrestrial technology?

30:56.037 --> 31:00.173
And if so, what does the end of the war

31:00.275 --> 31:03.009
suggest about
the world's next generation

31:03.111 --> 31:06.112
of advanced scientific breakthroughs?

31:11.361 --> 31:13.961
Lund University, Sweden.

31:14.064 --> 31:17.198
August 27, 2013.

31:19.202 --> 31:21.469
Researchers confirm the existence

31:21.571 --> 31:23.905
of a new element on the periodic table

31:24.007 --> 31:26.541
created through nuclear fusion.

31:29.112 --> 31:31.612
They name it ununpentium,

31:31.715 --> 31:34.315
or Element 115.

31:34.417 --> 31:38.119
Although most scientists
still don't know much

31:38.221 --> 31:41.322
about this unique radioactive component,

31:41.424 --> 31:44.325
it shares commonalities with Plutonium,

31:44.427 --> 31:46.994
used in experimental rocket fuels.

31:53.136 --> 31:56.270
Element 115 has
its own lore in UFO history.

31:56.373 --> 31:58.806
So, this was said to be an element

31:58.908 --> 32:01.476
described by a gentleman
named Bob Lazar,

32:01.578 --> 32:04.779
who claimed to have worked
just south of Area 51

32:04.881 --> 32:07.682
on "an E.T. flying saucer."

32:07.784 --> 32:11.886
The government is holding,
uh, nine alien spacecraft,

32:11.988 --> 32:13.721
um...

32:13.823 --> 32:18.426
that are propelled by
a modified gravity generator.

32:18.528 --> 32:20.695
Uh...

32:20.797 --> 32:22.063
It's being-- work is being conducted

32:22.165 --> 32:24.766
15 miles south of Groom Lake.

32:24.868 --> 32:27.902
At that isolated area only,
designated as S4,

32:28.004 --> 32:30.605
um, that at least
one of those crafts operate.

32:30.707 --> 32:33.107
According to what Lazar said,

32:33.209 --> 32:37.245
these alien craft ran on Element 115.

32:37.347 --> 32:39.113
And there's no evidence
that we have this

32:39.215 --> 32:41.182
even occurring naturally
anywhere on Earth.

32:41.284 --> 32:45.019
Well, it turns out
that scientists now claim

32:45.121 --> 32:49.690
to have created Element 115
by atomic collisions.

32:52.896 --> 32:55.696
I think this recent
discovery of ununpentium

32:55.799 --> 32:58.866
really does help us understand
the significance

32:58.968 --> 33:00.501
of Bob Lazar's testimony.

33:00.603 --> 33:05.807
This was a man who was exposed
to a very rare element

33:05.909 --> 33:07.508
that was allegedly part of

33:07.610 --> 33:11.479
the propulsion system of
an extraterrestrial vehicle.

33:18.288 --> 33:21.689
On December 23, 2015,

33:21.791 --> 33:25.593
yet another groundbreaking
material makes headlines.

33:25.695 --> 33:29.230
Scientists working at
the University of California

33:29.332 --> 33:31.532
announce the creation of a new metal

33:31.634 --> 33:35.503
that is strong and lightweight,
but also flexible

33:35.605 --> 33:38.706
and resistant
to extremely high temperatures.

33:38.808 --> 33:40.708
What's really exciting
about this material

33:40.810 --> 33:43.244
is you don't lose
a lot of its flexibility,

33:43.346 --> 33:45.012
what we call
its plastic-like properties.

33:46.749 --> 33:48.916
A lot of metals,
when you make them strong,

33:49.018 --> 33:50.618
become very brittle.

33:50.720 --> 33:53.287
So this material has
a large number of application,

33:53.389 --> 33:56.023
whether it be a car,
an airplane or a spaceship.

34:00.196 --> 34:02.029
While this miracle metal

34:02.131 --> 34:05.199
is unlike any alloy developed before,

34:05.301 --> 34:08.636
some believe its description
is actually familiar,

34:08.737 --> 34:12.773
and that it may be a match
to the strange material

34:12.876 --> 34:16.511
allegedly retrieved
by Major Jesse Marcel

34:16.612 --> 34:18.545
from the infamous Roswell crash.

34:20.583 --> 34:23.016
Most of the stuff at Roswell

34:23.119 --> 34:25.119
was extraordinarily lightweight,

34:25.221 --> 34:27.655
very thin foil-like material,

34:27.757 --> 34:31.458
very, very strong,
but weighing next to nothing.

34:31.561 --> 34:33.127
That's from people who handled it.

34:35.732 --> 34:37.665
The UCLA guys are doing research,

34:37.766 --> 34:41.135
open research more or less,
with the stuff from Roswell.

34:43.139 --> 34:44.605
This material is the beginning

34:44.706 --> 34:48.309
of an entirely new revolution
in materials science,

34:48.411 --> 34:52.013
where we are now going to be
able to engineer materials

34:52.114 --> 34:54.014
at the molecular level.

34:54.117 --> 34:58.085
And this does appear to be
the fruits of a long-term

34:58.187 --> 35:01.289
reversing-engineering program,
where those technologies

35:01.391 --> 35:03.758
are being brought
into the corporate sector

35:03.860 --> 35:06.594
and now it's become something
that we all take for granted.

35:08.565 --> 35:10.331
It's been seven decades

35:10.433 --> 35:13.568
since the, what I call, the first lie,

35:13.670 --> 35:17.171
which was the foundational lie
at Roswell happened.

35:17.273 --> 35:22.243
And still, the official line
of the United States

35:22.345 --> 35:24.612
is that this is a subject
they don't know about

35:24.714 --> 35:26.213
and don't care about.

35:26.316 --> 35:29.917
Which is about as far from the
truth as you could possibly get.

35:30.019 --> 35:34.288
We're beginning to understand
the extraterrestrial craft,

35:34.390 --> 35:37.325
its mechanism, how it works
and how it functions.

35:37.427 --> 35:41.996
And I'm convinced we're gonna be
able to travel in space,

35:42.098 --> 35:43.631
sooner than later,

35:43.733 --> 35:47.568
the same way
that these E.T.s have come here.

35:47.670 --> 35:49.236
It's almost as if
these extraterrestrials

35:49.339 --> 35:51.872
are giving us a little bit here,
a little bit there,

35:51.975 --> 35:53.574
and they're leading us somewhere,

35:53.676 --> 35:56.110
which we're ultimately gonna
find out very soon

35:56.212 --> 35:57.645
where this is going.

36:00.817 --> 36:02.316
Is it possible

36:02.418 --> 36:06.187
modern-day scientists are
finally decoding the puzzle

36:06.289 --> 36:07.989
of the advanced technological debris

36:08.091 --> 36:11.058
left scattered across the globe?

36:11.160 --> 36:13.928
Could it be that we have
finally reached a level

36:14.030 --> 36:16.998
of technological sophistication
that allows us

36:17.100 --> 36:22.036
to fully understand
extraterrestrial technology

36:22.138 --> 36:26.507
and prepares us for yet another
alien encounter?

36:31.489 --> 36:33.022
Tucson, Arizona.

36:33.124 --> 36:36.826
June 17, 2014.

36:36.928 --> 36:39.762
Just two months before his death,

36:39.864 --> 36:41.397
Boyd Bushman, a senior scientist

36:41.499 --> 36:45.935
at Lockheed Martin working with
missile and laser technology,

36:46.037 --> 36:50.306
records a video confessional
to be released after his death.

36:52.510 --> 36:55.344
My name is Boyd Bushman.

36:55.446 --> 36:59.415
I'm a senior scientist
from Lockheed Martin.

36:59.517 --> 37:04.053
Um... I have 27 patents,

37:04.155 --> 37:07.223
and I've changed the world
several times.

37:07.325 --> 37:09.725
According to Bushman,

37:09.827 --> 37:12.328
while working at Lockheed Martin

37:12.430 --> 37:16.966
he met with individuals with the
highest clearance at Area 51.

37:17.068 --> 37:22.271
These individuals provided him
materials he understood to be

37:22.373 --> 37:24.173
extraterrestrial technology.

37:25.910 --> 37:29.879
They would give me pieces of UFOs,

37:29.981 --> 37:32.448
and I would come to my laboratories.

37:32.550 --> 37:37.420
There's three elements
which the UFO is contained.

37:37.522 --> 37:39.255
One is telluride,

37:39.357 --> 37:41.190
the other's germanium,

37:41.292 --> 37:42.892
the other's palladium.

37:42.994 --> 37:45.327
And not only that,

37:45.430 --> 37:50.499
but the things pick up and fly
using anti-gravity.

37:50.601 --> 37:55.704
But perhaps the most
intriguing claim made by Bushman

37:55.807 --> 37:57.840
involves knowledge of extraterrestrials

37:57.942 --> 38:03.412
aiding government scientists
at bases like Area 51.

38:03.514 --> 38:07.950
They're approximately five-five feet--

38:08.052 --> 38:10.820
four-and-a-half to five feet tall.

38:10.922 --> 38:14.690
We have a total of at least 18

38:14.792 --> 38:19.628
that exist and operate
with our facility.

38:19.730 --> 38:22.364
Now notice, the eyes are different,

38:22.467 --> 38:25.568
nose are different, but they do have

38:25.670 --> 38:29.472
five fingers, five toes, uh, two eyes.

38:32.543 --> 38:36.912
The release of
the video online creates a stir,

38:37.014 --> 38:40.816
with many viewers insisting
that it must be a hoax.

38:40.918 --> 38:43.652
But why would a renowned
engineer and physicist

38:43.754 --> 38:47.122
lie about something so important?

38:47.225 --> 38:50.893
Could it be that the long-held
rumors of reverse-engineering

38:50.995 --> 38:53.162
of otherworldly technology

38:53.264 --> 38:55.931
and even stories of
extraterrestrial involvement

38:56.033 --> 38:59.935
in secret military projects
are actually true?

39:02.106 --> 39:04.840
So much of the digital world

39:04.942 --> 39:07.676
goes right back to the retrieval

39:07.778 --> 39:10.946
of extraterrestrial craft and beings.

39:12.750 --> 39:16.051
Which the government
drew a wall and said,

39:16.153 --> 39:18.888
"No one is to know."

39:18.990 --> 39:21.156
But the truth is,

39:21.259 --> 39:24.260
the 21st century is being built

39:24.362 --> 39:28.030
on extraterrestrial technology.

39:28.132 --> 39:33.002
How is it possible that,
in the last 70 years,

39:33.104 --> 39:36.539
we've accomplished more than
in the last 5,000 years,

39:36.641 --> 39:39.742
technologically speaking?

39:42.613 --> 39:44.680
What makes us so special today

39:44.782 --> 39:49.618
that we didn't know about
5,000 years ago?

39:49.720 --> 39:51.420
So I think that

39:51.522 --> 39:54.156
the technological advancements
we've made

39:54.258 --> 39:58.093
are due to retrieving
extraterrestrial technology.

39:58.195 --> 40:01.864
One has to wonder if these puzzle pieces

40:01.966 --> 40:06.335
were left here deliberately
or on accident.

40:08.839 --> 40:10.739
If the U.S. military, and perhaps

40:10.841 --> 40:13.542
other militaries around the world,

40:13.644 --> 40:17.947
have gained technology from crashed

40:18.049 --> 40:22.217
alien ships on our planet,
then you would think

40:22.320 --> 40:25.588
that the extraterrestrials themselves

40:25.690 --> 40:28.223
want us to have this technology,

40:28.326 --> 40:30.593
and that we've actually been given

40:30.695 --> 40:33.262
this same kind of technology.

40:33.364 --> 40:34.597
I mean, we've seen

40:34.699 --> 40:38.033
staggering technological
developments recently.

40:38.135 --> 40:41.604
It's been suggested that
this is part of a program

40:41.706 --> 40:45.040
to bring us up technologically.

40:46.444 --> 40:48.811
One of the most amazing things
about this idea

40:48.913 --> 40:51.780
of reverse-engineering alien technology

40:51.882 --> 40:55.117
is that it's taken quite a while
for us to actually

40:55.219 --> 40:58.120
be able to understand it
and to be able to utilize it.

40:58.222 --> 41:00.189
Maybe we are now reaching a level

41:00.291 --> 41:03.258
of technological sophistication
that we're going to be able to

41:03.361 --> 41:05.327
match the advanced extraterrestrials.

41:08.366 --> 41:11.467
All these things
come back to the question of:

41:11.569 --> 41:13.869
what are their designs on our planet,

41:13.971 --> 41:17.306
and are they interested
in our best interest

41:17.408 --> 41:19.808
or are they interested in
their best interest?

41:22.780 --> 41:24.580
Might Roswell, and other crashes

41:24.682 --> 41:26.582
covered up worldwide,

41:26.684 --> 41:29.551
have been orchestrated by aliens

41:29.654 --> 41:33.489
in order to technologically
advance the human race?

41:33.591 --> 41:35.157
Have world governments

41:35.259 --> 41:37.693
been secretly reverse-engineering

41:37.795 --> 41:42.731
the extraterrestrial debris
scattered across the globe?

41:42.833 --> 41:45.401
Perhaps the time has arrived

41:45.503 --> 41:51.507
for humanity to become a truly
spacefaring civilization,

41:51.609 --> 41:56.812
as may have been intended by
our alien ancestors all along.
