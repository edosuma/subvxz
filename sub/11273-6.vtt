WEBVTT

00:07.200 --> 00:10.272
- Okay, who's next?
- Make way for Norm.

00:10.647 --> 00:15.357
Come on in, Mr Peterson, and we've
got the bathroom-stuffing record.

00:15.754 --> 00:19.429
World's record, here we come!

00:21.983 --> 00:25.658
We did it!
Congratulations! Drinks are on me!

00:30.247 --> 00:32.363
The door's stuck.

00:32.656 --> 00:36.046
It won't budge.
There's too many people in here.

00:37.182 --> 00:38.740
Bartender must've stepped out.

00:38.968 --> 00:41.163
Have a seat.
I gotta use the bathroom, okay?

00:48.726 --> 00:51.001
Occupied.

00:53.000 --> 00:59.074

02:05.342 --> 02:09.539
Norm, we had the bathroom-stuffing
championship in our grasp and blew it.

02:09.868 --> 02:12.302
Oh, gee, I see how I miscounted.

02:12.568 --> 02:17.084
Boy, I had myself down here twice.
See, "Woody" and "me."

02:18.298 --> 02:19.970
Here's to noble failure, huh?

02:20.208 --> 02:22.961
Norm, I can't drink to that.
There's nothing noble about failure.

02:23.240 --> 02:25.549
If there was, you'd be a duke.

02:26.494 --> 02:28.644
Hey, Diane, hold it. Hold it.
Those aren't empty.

02:29.204 --> 02:31.672
Sorry, guys,
I'm a little distracted tonight.

02:32.707 --> 02:35.062
Oh, yeah? You got problems, Diane,
or just the usual?

02:37.917 --> 02:39.475
What do you mean, "the usual"?

02:39.877 --> 02:43.267
You know, just how you usually are,
you know.

02:44.380 --> 02:46.371
How am I usually?

02:46.965 --> 02:48.444
So you're distracted, huh?

02:49.216 --> 02:52.288
Yes, I have to come up with $500
as quickly as possible.

02:52.635 --> 02:55.911
What for?
Hush money for Miss Clairol?

02:58.680 --> 03:02.195
No. But I love the new thing
that you've done with your hair,

03:02.516 --> 03:05.508
and I think you should
continue washing it.

03:06.768 --> 03:10.522
"Continue."
That was totally uncalled-for.

03:11.396 --> 03:12.875
So what do you need 500 bucks for?

03:13.439 --> 03:16.351
Well, are you familiar with the Farthing
for Your Thoughts bookstore?

03:16.649 --> 03:18.685
I've dallied there betimes, yeah.

03:18.984 --> 03:20.258
Very funny, Norman.

03:20.485 --> 03:22.282
Anyway, I was browsing there
this morning

03:22.527 --> 03:25.166
when I unearthed
a rare Hemingway volume.

03:25.446 --> 03:26.765
I know what everybody's thinking:

03:26.989 --> 03:29.822
"Diane Chambers' sensibilities
attuned to Hemingway?"

03:30.116 --> 03:32.550
Wow, that's really close.

03:33.701 --> 03:36.852
Anyway, I discovered that
Hemingway's signature is in the book.

03:37.162 --> 03:40.871
And it's priced at a laughable $500.

03:41.206 --> 03:43.401
The owners of the store
don't know what they're doing.

03:43.665 --> 03:47.783
It's right there on the title page:
"Ernest Hemingway, Madrid, 1927."

03:48.126 --> 03:50.162
Why don't you ask
that rich old lady of yours, huh?

03:50.419 --> 03:52.853
She's got more money than
me and God put together.

03:53.130 --> 03:55.928
No, I can't ask Mummy.

03:56.215 --> 03:59.491
- I'd rather die.
- I like that even better.

04:00.843 --> 04:04.597
I told her long ago I was going
to prove my own worth.

04:04.929 --> 04:06.806
I refuse to go to her begging now.

04:07.054 --> 04:10.330
Come on, Diane, she's your ma.
She carried you for nine months.

04:10.641 --> 04:12.711
Eight. I was premature.

04:12.975 --> 04:16.206
Couldn't wait to get out
and start yapping.

04:18.644 --> 04:20.714
It has occurred to me that

04:20.980 --> 04:23.778
I could possibly get the money
right here at Cheers.

04:24.065 --> 04:28.536
If you can't rely on friends,
who can you rely on?

04:30.110 --> 04:31.429
I thought maybe I could ask Sam.

04:32.528 --> 04:35.406
You bet.
He's got a lot of money.

04:36.447 --> 04:40.076
But I don't know.
Given our past relationship,

04:40.408 --> 04:43.639
I just don't think I'd feel comfortable
borrowing from him.

04:43.952 --> 04:46.022
On the other hand,
I don't know where else to turn.

04:46.287 --> 04:49.359
Well, Miss Chambers, I'm gonna
give you every bit of money I have.

04:49.706 --> 04:53.665
- Oh, no, Woody. I couldn't.
- No, no, I insist.

04:55.625 --> 04:57.422
Oh, wow, that's wonderful.

04:57.668 --> 05:00.660
I must've got my pockets
picked again.

05:01.003 --> 05:03.039
Well, welcome to the big city.

05:03.339 --> 05:05.216
Thank you, Mr Clavin.

05:06.757 --> 05:08.793
Woody.

05:10.801 --> 05:13.793
- Thanks for trying to help.
- Thanks.

05:15.138 --> 05:17.857
Well, I guess I have no choice.

05:18.347 --> 05:20.781
Now, how best to approach Sam?

05:21.975 --> 05:25.365
I could appeal to his generosity...

05:26.685 --> 05:28.641
...his good nature.

05:29.604 --> 05:34.120
It wouldn't hurt to remind him
that I'm a woman.

05:34.775 --> 05:36.731
I'd carry a sign.

05:41.111 --> 05:42.783
Sam?

05:43.738 --> 05:45.057
Is now a bad time?

05:45.697 --> 05:48.609
No, but I think it's about to be.

05:50.117 --> 05:51.516
You goose.

05:52.993 --> 05:57.828
Sam, would you say that
our relationship has matured?

05:59.998 --> 06:02.671
If you mean getting kind of old, yeah.

06:04.458 --> 06:07.814
Well, you're a regular Noel Coward
with a liquor license.

06:08.628 --> 06:10.459
I don't-- I don't get it.

06:11.338 --> 06:13.294
I'm painfully aware of that.

06:13.548 --> 06:18.224
Sam, I know you to be a man
of pride and principle,

06:18.593 --> 06:22.586
but strength is also to be found
in the ability to bend.

06:22.928 --> 06:26.238
Witness the willow,
nature's strongest tree.

06:26.555 --> 06:28.864
No, I thought the oak was
the strongest tree.

06:29.140 --> 06:30.493
Only in furniture.

06:30.725 --> 06:33.478
What about the saying
"strong as the mighty oak"?

06:33.768 --> 06:36.999
The oak can be felled by a single harsh
wind under the right circumstances.

06:37.312 --> 06:39.189
But what about birch and mahogany?
Now, those--

06:39.438 --> 06:41.827
Would you shut up
about the damn trees?

06:42.106 --> 06:44.097
You brought them up.

06:44.358 --> 06:47.794
Sam, would you loan me
$500, please?

06:48.777 --> 06:50.096
Well, sure.

06:50.570 --> 06:52.686
But I haven't even told you
what it's for yet.

06:52.946 --> 06:56.063
Well, it doesn't matter.
Use it for whatever you babes buy.

06:56.365 --> 06:59.914
Hair curlers, clothes,
sewing notions. Whatever.

07:00.242 --> 07:02.881
It's nothing as trivial as that.

07:03.161 --> 07:05.356
Hey, listen. I mean it.
It doesn't matter.

07:05.620 --> 07:07.770
Really. I know how hard it was
for you to come in here

07:08.039 --> 07:10.348
begging like a dog for a bone.

07:11.916 --> 07:15.750
So I'm just trying to be sensitive
and not make things worse.

07:16.085 --> 07:19.475
Thank you for making it
easy for me, Sam.

07:21.672 --> 07:25.142
This really is
an extraordinary attitude.

07:25.924 --> 07:29.234
The truth is, I've had a lot of trouble
loaning people money in the past.

07:29.551 --> 07:32.987
You know, hurt a lot of feelings.
Lost a couple of buddies once.

07:33.304 --> 07:36.023
So I decided from now on,
anybody asks me,

07:36.305 --> 07:39.934
I'm just gonna give them the money
and never expect to see it again.

07:40.266 --> 07:42.382
Oh, you'll see it again.

07:42.642 --> 07:45.634
Diane Chambers
always honours her debts.

07:45.978 --> 07:48.333
Hey, I could care less. Really.
You walk out that door,

07:48.605 --> 07:50.721
I'm not even gonna think
about that money anymore.

07:50.981 --> 07:54.212
- You'll see it again.
- All right.

07:54.524 --> 07:56.879
- Thank you, Sam.
- Yeah.

07:57.152 --> 07:59.268
You handled this even better
than I expected.

07:59.527 --> 08:02.485
But even so, it was hard to come
in here and ask for this,

08:02.780 --> 08:05.738
given our past physical relationship.

08:06.032 --> 08:09.786
Yeah, it kind of feels like you should
be giving me the money, doesn't it?

08:19.999 --> 08:22.752
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!

08:23.042 --> 08:25.761
- Norman.
- What's the good word, Norm?

08:26.044 --> 08:28.842
Plop, plop, fizz, fizz.

08:29.504 --> 08:32.655
- No, not the Hungry Heifer.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:33.631 --> 08:35.668
One heartburn cocktail coming up.

08:35.924 --> 08:38.280
What's this Hungry Heifer place
you guys keep talking about?

08:38.551 --> 08:41.782
It's this terrible restaurant where
Norm insists on torturing himself.

08:42.095 --> 08:45.212
Hey, you're always giving the
Hungry Heifer a bad rap. I don't get it.

08:45.514 --> 08:47.425
So I've had a few bad meals there.

08:47.682 --> 08:48.956
But it's the best value in town.

08:49.183 --> 08:50.616
Woody, their steaks come
by the pound.

08:50.850 --> 08:52.568
Wow, the steaks are that big?

08:52.810 --> 08:55.563
No, that's where they get them.

08:58.938 --> 09:02.408
- I'll have to try it sometime.
- Yeah, I recommend Thursday night.

09:02.732 --> 09:05.963
That's when the chef does
his tribute to swine.

09:06.860 --> 09:10.091
Sam, two vodka tonics
and a Rob Roy, please.

09:10.404 --> 09:13.601
By the way, Sam, has Diane
paid back that loan yet?

09:14.823 --> 09:17.735
No, Carla, she hasn't.
But I could care less.

09:18.534 --> 09:21.332
Not one dime? It's been
two weeks already, hasn't it?

09:21.619 --> 09:23.337
Yes, Carla, it has.

09:23.578 --> 09:26.376
But you can't expect her to pay
back that kind of money overnight.

09:26.663 --> 09:28.096
She's just a hard-working waitress.

09:28.331 --> 09:30.765
Diane got a job
as a waitress somewhere?

09:34.126 --> 09:36.879
Sam, could you also give
me change, please?

09:37.170 --> 09:39.968
- You bet.
- Okay.

09:40.255 --> 09:44.214
My, what a lovely sweater, Diane.

09:44.549 --> 09:47.382
- Why, thank you, Carla.
- Is it new?

09:47.676 --> 09:50.827
Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.
How nice of you to notice.

09:51.137 --> 09:55.449
Well, how could I help but notice
such a beautiful garment?

09:55.806 --> 09:59.003
Cashmere, unless I miss my guess.

09:59.350 --> 10:00.749
Yes, it is.

10:01.018 --> 10:03.327
Must have cost you
an arm and a leg, huh?

10:03.602 --> 10:08.392
No, no, it was marked down 2 percent
at Haute and Bothered last week.

10:08.773 --> 10:13.210
Well, we girls deserve to splurge
on ourselves once in a while.

10:13.567 --> 10:16.923
- Don't you think, Sam?
- I could care less.

10:17.277 --> 10:19.427
All right, I'm ready for a beer, Sam.

10:20.529 --> 10:22.406
Hey, what's Mr Clavin doing?

10:22.656 --> 10:23.884
You're not gonna believe this,

10:24.114 --> 10:26.992
but he's trying to get into the record
book for walking backwards.

10:31.369 --> 10:33.439
Everybody, afternoon good.

10:33.704 --> 10:36.855
That's-- That's "good afternoon,
everybody" backwards.

10:37.164 --> 10:39.280
And you're an "assjack."

10:42.668 --> 10:44.818
How close are you
to the record, Cliff?

10:45.086 --> 10:48.396
Well, in two days,
1 7 hours, 33 minutes,

10:48.713 --> 10:51.386
I'll be backing myself into the
history books. Thank you, Sammy.

10:51.673 --> 10:54.904
I think I'll just take a quick reverse
strut around the old pool table,

10:55.217 --> 10:57.447
pick up some women backwards.

10:58.678 --> 11:01.715
All right, I know you guys think
that Cliff is pretty weird,

11:02.013 --> 11:05.972
but I'll say this much for him,
he'll probably never reproduce.

11:07.682 --> 11:09.752
Hey, that looks pretty good.

11:10.018 --> 11:12.373
- You should just taste it.
- What is it?

11:12.644 --> 11:14.555
It's lobster salad.

11:14.812 --> 11:18.885
Lobster? Was there
a sale on that stuff?

11:19.398 --> 11:20.956
This time of year?
Are you kidding?

11:21.316 --> 11:23.546
- Would you like a bite?
- No, no. No, thanks.

11:23.818 --> 11:28.130
No, it's okay, I got too much.
I'll just end up feeding it to a cat.

11:29.070 --> 11:31.106
No, thank you. Thanks, anyway.

11:31.363 --> 11:33.957
I lost my appetite here
for some reason.

11:34.240 --> 11:37.232
- She's got new shoes too.
- Who does?

11:38.285 --> 11:41.880
You know who. The one dribbling
lobster all over her cashmere.

11:45.080 --> 11:48.072
- I could care less.
- You know something, Sam,

11:48.374 --> 11:50.649
Diane certainly borrowed this
money from the right guy.

11:50.917 --> 11:54.626
I mean, here she is,
throwing her cash around like water,

11:54.961 --> 11:56.553
and she owes you a bundle.

11:56.795 --> 11:59.263
Most people I know
would be going crazy now,

11:59.547 --> 12:01.697
especially if they knew what
she spent that money on.

12:02.216 --> 12:03.854
What do I gotta do,
tell you over and over?

12:04.091 --> 12:05.604
I don't wanna know
what she spent it on.

12:05.842 --> 12:09.517
I don't care what she spent it on. I'm
not interested in what she spent it on.

12:09.845 --> 12:12.279
Sam, by the way, I'm gonna
be a little late tomorrow.

12:12.555 --> 12:15.274
I'm having a facial and a massage.

12:15.598 --> 12:17.475
What did she spend it on?

12:18.433 --> 12:19.582
A book.

12:20.226 --> 12:22.103
- A book.
- A book.

12:22.686 --> 12:26.235
- One book?
- One single $500 book.

12:26.564 --> 12:28.634
And it's already been a movie.

12:31.524 --> 12:33.913
- A book.
- Excuse me.

12:35.361 --> 12:37.352
Would anybody like
to buy some cookies?

12:37.612 --> 12:41.207
Oh, I'd love to. I just can't refuse.

12:42.157 --> 12:45.354
- I'll take three boxes.
- Oh, thank you, ma'am.

12:45.658 --> 12:49.128
And thank you. There's a little
something extra there for you.

12:49.453 --> 12:51.762
Wow, thank you.

12:53.704 --> 12:57.777
Oh, I just love these things.

12:58.583 --> 13:00.892
Well, aren't you going to ask Sam
if he'd like some?

13:01.168 --> 13:03.079
Of course I am.
Care for a cookie, Sam?

13:03.336 --> 13:05.486
Oh, don't worry,
I have a lot more at home.

13:06.212 --> 13:09.727
- Help yourself.
- Don't mind if I do.

13:14.092 --> 13:18.244
Those are delicious.
I think I'll have a few more here.

13:19.762 --> 13:22.720
Boy, but once you start,
you just can't stop, can you?

13:27.600 --> 13:30.160
I probably shouldn't
have had that last one.

13:40.079 --> 13:43.992
I like my cookies this way. It takes
the work out of chewing, you know?

13:47.750 --> 13:50.708
Oh, hey, Diane, I'm so sorry
about this afternoon.

13:51.002 --> 13:53.880
I don't know what happened.
I feel like a sack of dirt.

13:54.171 --> 13:56.321
Don't be so hard on yourself, Sam.

13:56.589 --> 13:58.739
I'm sure you're not
the first man in history

13:59.007 --> 14:02.602
to throw a frothing fit
over 'Nana Doodles.

14:02.926 --> 14:04.996
I just don't know
what came over me.

14:05.261 --> 14:08.253
I do. Despite your assurances,

14:08.554 --> 14:12.706
you do not lend money
with the sang-froid you claim.

14:13.099 --> 14:15.090
I would like to see you in your office.

14:15.350 --> 14:17.386
I have something I want to give you.

14:17.852 --> 14:20.571
How about a good spanking?
I think I deserve it.

14:24.898 --> 14:27.048
For some mysterious reason,

14:27.316 --> 14:29.989
you seem to have doubted
my good intentions to pay you back.

14:30.275 --> 14:32.584
Well, what's the mystery?
I haven't seen dime one.

14:32.861 --> 14:35.853
Believe me, I fully intend
to return all your money.

14:36.155 --> 14:37.793
And to prove my good faith,

14:38.030 --> 14:40.225
I'm going to give you
what I purchased with the $500

14:40.490 --> 14:43.721
for you to hold as collateral
until I repay you.

14:44.034 --> 14:46.389
God, it really is a book.

14:47.619 --> 14:50.611
It's a book, and a very
valuable book.

14:50.913 --> 14:52.904
It's a first-edition Hemingway.

14:53.915 --> 14:58.033
The Sun Also Rises.
Oh, that's real profound.

15:01.252 --> 15:07.487
I purchased it for $500, but I'm
sure it's worth a great deal more.

15:08.048 --> 15:10.642
It's signed by
Ernest Hemingway himself.

15:10.925 --> 15:13.234
For 500 bucks, you'd think
Margaux Hemingway

15:13.510 --> 15:16.388
would come over to your house
and act it out for you.

15:17.388 --> 15:20.380
I'm taking a big risk entrusting
this to you, Sam.

15:20.682 --> 15:22.957
Please, go put it in the safe.

15:24.017 --> 15:26.133
And whatever you do,
don't let anything happen to it.

15:26.393 --> 15:28.987
Don't touch it, don't scratch it,
don't scratch with it.

15:29.270 --> 15:30.988
Hey, you know,
you really make me angry

15:31.229 --> 15:33.459
when you treat me
like some kind of animal.

15:33.730 --> 15:36.164
I'm sorry, Sam.
It won't happen again.

15:36.441 --> 15:40.116
Just put it in the safe, please.

15:41.485 --> 15:44.636
I'm sure there's room in there
right next to your bowl of kibble.

15:53.034 --> 15:55.343
Smells boring.

16:08.877 --> 16:12.836
Mr Clavin, you're walking forward.
What happened to the record?

16:13.671 --> 16:16.026
I was hours away,
and I met utter defeat.

16:16.340 --> 16:17.819
Oh, that's too bad.

16:18.049 --> 16:20.005
Yeah, it's doubly tragic.

16:20.259 --> 16:22.568
If I had had a witness, I would've
gotten the world's record

16:22.843 --> 16:26.722
for the loudest scream after
I backed into Ma's curling iron.

16:28.764 --> 16:31.995
Well, I'll tell you something, Mr Clavin,
whether you set the record or not,

16:32.308 --> 16:34.264
everyone here considers you a winner.

16:34.518 --> 16:36.873
That's pronounced "wiener."

16:39.937 --> 16:43.486
- Hey. Hey. Diane around yet?
- Not yet.

16:43.815 --> 16:47.410
Good. Does anybody
know how to fix this?

16:48.151 --> 16:49.425
What is it?

16:49.652 --> 16:52.849
Well, it's Diane's $500 book.

16:54.572 --> 16:58.008
No wonder it's so expensive.
It's inflatable.

16:58.657 --> 17:00.693
No, no, it's not supposed to
look like that, Woody.

17:00.950 --> 17:03.510
- What the heck happened to that?
- Well,

17:03.785 --> 17:07.618
I got interested in the darned thing,
and I took it home with me and...

17:07.954 --> 17:09.547
Then picture this.

17:09.789 --> 17:11.540
I get into a nice hot tub.

17:11.790 --> 17:14.588
I'm lying down to soak and read,
naked as a jaybird.

17:14.875 --> 17:16.752
And I'm reading,
and I'm reading, and I'm--

17:17.002 --> 17:19.960
Hold on, I can't get one
of your socks off.

17:21.878 --> 17:23.756
Never mind. I can.

17:24.255 --> 17:27.133
Anyway, I'm reading and reading,
and I finally come to the part

17:27.424 --> 17:29.460
where they tell us
the terrible thing that happened

17:29.717 --> 17:31.594
to this Jake Barnes guy
during the war.

17:32.177 --> 17:33.769
- What's that?
- Well,

17:34.011 --> 17:36.286
Iet's just say that suddenly
he could hit those high notes

17:36.555 --> 17:37.954
Iike he never could before.

17:38.431 --> 17:39.944
Ouch.

17:40.724 --> 17:43.841
Yeah, ouch. That's why I dropped
the book in the water.

17:44.142 --> 17:47.054
Now the darned thing won't shut.

17:47.353 --> 17:49.787
All right, just rip out
every other page.

17:50.522 --> 17:52.240
Come on, man.

17:52.482 --> 17:55.599
Diane's gonna be really angry at me.
She told me not to touch it,

17:55.900 --> 17:59.256
I touched it, and now it's fat.

18:01.528 --> 18:05.123
- Hello, everybody.
- Hi. Hey, how's it going?

18:05.447 --> 18:08.678
Oh, splendidly.
How's my precious volume?

18:08.991 --> 18:11.061
It's fine.
Why do you even bring it up?

18:12.034 --> 18:13.353
Well, don't be so sensitive.

18:13.577 --> 18:19.015
I just asked because I bought the most
beautiful antique bookstand for it.

18:20.331 --> 18:22.367
Is it expandable?

18:23.959 --> 18:25.790
It's very nice. It's very nice.

18:26.043 --> 18:27.317
The perfect complement

18:27.544 --> 18:30.536
to my inscribed first edition
The Sun Also Rises.

18:30.838 --> 18:32.191
Isn't it exquisite?

18:32.422 --> 18:34.731
Excuse me, my name
is Bruce Sayers.

18:35.006 --> 18:38.203
I'm an avid collector of
20th-century American literature.

18:38.508 --> 18:39.941
Hello. Diane Chambers.

18:40.176 --> 18:44.169
I heard you say that you have
an inscribed Sun Also Rises.

18:44.512 --> 18:47.310
- Is it in good condition?
- Oh, it's a lovely copy.

18:47.597 --> 18:49.986
No jacket, of course,
but signed by Papa himself.

18:50.266 --> 18:51.585
And it's a lovely thought.

18:51.808 --> 18:56.836
"Dear F. Scott,
boy, that Zelda is one crazy chick."

18:59.271 --> 19:02.946
- It's a simple autograph.
- I wonder if it might be for sale?

19:03.857 --> 19:08.055
Oh, no. I couldn't possibly place
a monetary value

19:08.402 --> 19:10.120
on something so personal to me.

19:10.361 --> 19:12.079
I'd give you $1,000 for it.

19:12.321 --> 19:15.040
Make the check out
to Diane Chambers.

19:15.323 --> 19:18.952
Sam, will you get this
man's Hemingway?

19:20.201 --> 19:22.795
- No, you can't do that.
- No, it's perfect.

19:23.077 --> 19:24.556
Now I can pay you back.

19:24.828 --> 19:28.059
No, you can't sell the book.
You love the book, Diane.

19:28.372 --> 19:31.205
Sam, we love people.

19:31.499 --> 19:33.330
We own books.

19:33.584 --> 19:36.144
Besides, even as a child
I found Hemingway to be

19:36.418 --> 19:39.774
pretentious and over-mannered.
For my taste.

19:40.088 --> 19:43.603
- Sam, go get it from the safe.
- Yeah, I see. All right, yeah.

19:43.923 --> 19:48.121
This may take a minute. The safe's--
The combination's kind of complex.

19:48.467 --> 19:50.742
Oh, don't you remember?
It's your birthday.

19:51.011 --> 19:53.650
It is? Hell, I should be
out there celebrating.

19:53.929 --> 19:55.567
Go, Sam.

20:04.060 --> 20:05.971
Pull out these...

20:07.896 --> 20:09.773
Sam?

20:12.524 --> 20:14.242
Yeah?

20:14.817 --> 20:18.127
I thought it would he better to
conduct our business in private.

20:18.444 --> 20:21.914
- What's taking you so long?
- Well, I was just thinking.

20:22.238 --> 20:24.194
Say no more.

20:25.740 --> 20:28.254
You know, I was about
to open the safe...

20:28.992 --> 20:30.664
...and a voice in
the back of my head said,

20:30.910 --> 20:33.902
"Don't let Diane sell the book.
She loves that book."

20:34.204 --> 20:37.116
The voice was wrong.
Open the safe.

20:37.414 --> 20:40.645
I completely understand the value of
sentiment, but I must have that book.

20:40.958 --> 20:45.873
Yeah, me too. That's why I'm
gonna give you 1,010.

20:46.253 --> 20:48.244
- Sam.
- Eleven hundred.

20:48.504 --> 20:50.734
- Eleven-ten.
- Do you know what you're doing?

20:51.006 --> 20:53.918
- Eleven-fifty.
- I know it sounds crazy,

20:54.215 --> 20:56.934
but when I was getting your book
out of the safe very carefully,

20:57.217 --> 21:01.654
I started to look through the pages
very, very, very carefully, and l...

21:02.012 --> 21:03.843
Well, I fell in love
with the darned thing.

21:05.014 --> 21:07.448
- You're serious, aren't you?
- Yeah, you bet I am.

21:08.183 --> 21:11.061
- Eleven-sixty.
- It must be an extraordinary specimen.

21:11.351 --> 21:13.307
- Eleven-seventy-five.
- Twelve hundred.

21:13.560 --> 21:15.278
- Twelve--
- Stop. Enough.

21:15.520 --> 21:17.670
We're throwing around
monetary figures here

21:17.939 --> 21:20.533
as if they had a place
in the world of art.

21:20.815 --> 21:23.693
Sam Malone,
you have taught me a lesson

21:23.984 --> 21:26.862
about the true value
of literature tonight.

21:27.152 --> 21:29.871
I'm sorry, Mr Sayers,
the book is no longer for sale.

21:30.154 --> 21:31.428
I want Sam to have it.

21:31.655 --> 21:35.489
Oh, all right. Hey, I hope there are no
hard feelings here, Sayers, old man.

21:35.824 --> 21:37.542
I can't say I'm not disappointed,

21:37.783 --> 21:40.343
but it's heartening to know
there are people around like you.

21:40.619 --> 21:41.938
People who love books.

21:42.161 --> 21:44.595
Love them? I just wish
you could eat them.

21:46.914 --> 21:49.474
I don't know what to say.

21:50.500 --> 21:53.298
I'm looking at you in
an entirely new light.

21:54.752 --> 21:58.108
- What do you mean?
- Well, I don't know myself,

21:58.421 --> 22:01.413
but I think tonight I saw in full flower

22:01.714 --> 22:04.547
the sensitivity you try so hard
to conceal.

22:06.301 --> 22:09.020
Oh, well, that's-- That's no big deal.

22:09.303 --> 22:12.659
Oh, no. You were wonderful.

22:12.971 --> 22:16.361
Yeah, well, I guess my little
masquerade's over.

22:16.682 --> 22:19.992
I am sensitive as all get-out.

22:21.727 --> 22:25.037
Honestly, Sam, I don't know what
brought about this change,

22:25.354 --> 22:30.064
but I find myself extremely
attracted to you just now.

22:30.815 --> 22:33.010
There's something stirring
inside me.

22:33.276 --> 22:37.349
I don't know what it is,
but I'm becoming flushed.

22:41.113 --> 22:43.752
Yeah, maybe it is getting
a little hot in here.

22:44.657 --> 22:46.295
Very hot.

22:46.992 --> 22:49.904
And you mean all I had to do
was go nuts over a book?

22:50.202 --> 22:54.434
Oh, I know it's crazy.
All the warning signals are flashing.

22:54.788 --> 22:58.144
I never intended for this to happen,
but it's out of my control.

22:58.457 --> 23:00.209
Kiss me, Sam.

23:02.793 --> 23:06.786
You know, truth is, I've been thinking
about getting a lot more books.

23:10.422 --> 23:13.141
Yeah, maybe even getting
a library card, huh?

23:14.425 --> 23:16.302
- Oh, Sam.
- What?

23:16.552 --> 23:18.747
- lsn't it amazing how life works out?
- Yeah.

23:19.011 --> 23:21.366
When we woke up this morning,
who would have guessed

23:21.638 --> 23:23.629
that we'd end the day this way?

23:23.889 --> 23:26.244
Just look.
You have a beautiful book,

23:26.515 --> 23:30.508
I've made myself a tidy little profit,
and we're in each other's arms.

23:34.437 --> 23:36.428
A tidy little profit?

23:37.522 --> 23:41.834
Yes. Your last bid was $1,200.

23:44.110 --> 23:46.146
You expecting $1,200 from me?

23:47.862 --> 23:51.138
No, of course not,
you big, foolish man.

23:51.447 --> 23:54.996
I intend to deduct
the $500 I owe you,

23:55.325 --> 23:56.804
and you really only owe me $700.

23:57.034 --> 24:00.151
But let's stop talking
and start rejoicing.

24:00.453 --> 24:02.409
Hold me, Sam.

24:05.706 --> 24:08.095
Sam, you're holding me a little tight.

24:09.500 --> 24:12.412
Sam, I can't breathe.
