00:05.239 --> 00:07.941
Amber, show your brother
how to do a handstand.

00:08.008 --> 00:09.543
Handstands are for girls.

00:09.610 --> 00:11.045
- Hey.

00:20.921 --> 00:23.324
How are my precious
little dumplings today?

00:23.391 --> 00:25.226
Come in the pool,
Aunt Darlene.

00:25.293 --> 00:27.561
Aunt Darlene's
got to get to work.

00:29.697 --> 00:30.431
Love you.

00:30.498 --> 00:32.566
Love you.

00:32.633 --> 00:34.868
Y'all have fun.
See you tomorrow.

00:34.935 --> 00:36.036
Thanks, Dar.

00:36.104 --> 00:38.206
See you tomorrow,
Aunt Darlene.

00:38.272 --> 00:40.408
- So how'd you do?
- Seven.

00:40.474 --> 00:42.876
- Nice.
- Yeah.

00:42.943 --> 00:44.145
All right, kids. Come on.

00:44.212 --> 00:46.847
Get out of the pool.

00:46.914 --> 00:48.749
Bye, Aunt Darlene.

00:54.955 --> 00:56.490
Are you sure
this is a good idea?

01:01.962 --> 01:03.231
Hell yeah.

01:21.382 --> 01:22.916
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

01:52.746 --> 01:53.981
Wait till you see what I got.

01:54.047 --> 01:55.015
Go, go, go, go, go.

02:17.104 --> 02:19.072
Mom.

02:19.139 --> 02:20.774
What happened? You okay?

02:20.841 --> 02:22.810
Oh, I got a spot
on my blouse.

02:22.876 --> 02:25.045
So I went to Marshalls
to get another.

02:25.112 --> 02:28.115
You can't walk to Marshalls.
That's, like, three miles away.

02:28.182 --> 02:29.850
I couldn't find my car keys.

02:29.917 --> 02:32.085
You're not supposed
to be driving, either.

02:32.152 --> 02:33.153
You can't do this.

02:33.221 --> 02:34.588
No?

02:35.889 --> 02:37.325
Hey, Mom.

02:37.391 --> 02:38.892
Why don't you put this on, okay?

02:38.959 --> 02:40.228
Okay.

02:40.294 --> 02:43.096
- Is she okay?
- Okay.

02:44.865 --> 02:46.700
She's dazed and confused.

02:46.767 --> 02:49.670
PD found her wandering
down Riverdale Avenue,

02:49.737 --> 02:51.639
barefoot in her bra.

02:51.705 --> 02:53.006
I was in the shower.

02:53.073 --> 02:54.675
I didn't hear
the door alert go off.

02:54.742 --> 02:56.577
- This is bad, Claire.
- I know.

02:56.644 --> 02:58.111
I brought her a shirt.

02:58.178 --> 02:59.580
Not that. This.

02:59.647 --> 03:01.582
Everything.

03:01.649 --> 03:03.484
She has to go
to assisted living.

03:03.551 --> 03:06.186
They say that when
we're ready, it's time.

03:09.390 --> 03:10.858
I'll make the call today.

03:12.693 --> 03:14.295
Work. I got to go.

03:14.362 --> 03:15.963
Can you--
- Of course.

03:16.029 --> 03:16.997
Go.

03:23.971 --> 03:26.640
Hey, you must be
Agent Barnes.

03:26.707 --> 03:28.342
I'm Remy Scott.
Nice to finally meet you.

03:28.409 --> 03:29.877
Likewise.

03:29.943 --> 03:31.679
- How's the little one?
- Theo's doing great, thanks.

03:31.745 --> 03:33.781
So no second thoughts
about coming back to work?

03:33.847 --> 03:36.116
Truth be told, I think
Theo's happier with my nanny

03:36.183 --> 03:37.585
than with me or my wife.

03:37.651 --> 03:39.653
Good, 'cause you'll need
to jump in with both feet.

03:39.720 --> 03:41.355
Ortiz transferred to LA.

03:41.422 --> 03:42.656
Father's having
health problems.

03:42.723 --> 03:44.392
Yeah, I heard.
I'll have to reach out to him.

03:44.458 --> 03:46.059
Ladies, good morning.

03:46.126 --> 03:49.630
Sheryll!
Oh, it's so good to see you.

03:49.697 --> 03:51.265
Good to see you. Hey.

03:51.332 --> 03:52.566
How are the kids?

03:52.633 --> 03:53.901
What's going on here?

03:53.967 --> 03:55.503
<i>Summer day camp
this morning.</i>

03:55.569 --> 03:56.837
A mass shooting
at a Delaware summer camp.

03:56.904 --> 03:58.772
Perp just surrendered.

03:58.839 --> 04:00.107
Seems like nowhere's
safe anymore.

04:00.173 --> 04:01.742
<i>Used a military-style
assault rifle</i>

04:01.809 --> 04:04.778
<i>to randomly fire upon
the young victims...</i>

04:04.845 --> 04:06.647
Anais is about
to start second grade.

04:06.714 --> 04:08.649
We get ads
for bulletproof backpacks.

04:08.716 --> 04:10.351
That's awful,
but we can't go down

04:10.418 --> 04:11.719
that rabbit hole right now.

04:11.785 --> 04:13.421
We have a fugitive to track.
Anna?

04:13.487 --> 04:16.590
Yeah, a family of four was
shot dead in a motel room

04:16.657 --> 04:17.991
in Georgia this morning.

04:18.058 --> 04:21.362
Brad and Louanne Cameron
and their two kids.

04:21.429 --> 04:22.596
Why did we catch this?

04:22.663 --> 04:24.164
ATF requested an assist.

04:24.231 --> 04:26.066
Details to follow
when we get there.

04:26.133 --> 04:27.067
Okay.

04:27.134 --> 04:28.436
Bird's gassed up
and ready to go.

04:28.502 --> 04:29.470
Let's roll.

04:31.572 --> 04:32.773
Welcome back.

04:32.840 --> 04:34.141
<i>Yet all too familiar tableau</i>

04:34.207 --> 04:36.109
<i>in our country's
recent history.</i>

04:45.553 --> 04:46.820
Lucas Peele, ATF.

04:46.887 --> 04:48.589
Remy Scott, Agent Gaines.

04:48.656 --> 04:50.691
Thanks for getting here pronto.

04:50.758 --> 04:52.760
- This was a shoot out?
- Not quite.

04:52.826 --> 04:54.828
Our shooter finished off
the whole family

04:54.895 --> 04:56.697
before Dad got off a shot.

04:56.764 --> 04:57.731
Was it someone they knew?

04:57.798 --> 04:58.866
Could be.

04:58.932 --> 05:00.768
No sign of forced entry.

05:00.834 --> 05:02.636
So much for a good guy
with a gun, huh?

05:02.703 --> 05:04.237
Maybe not so good.

05:08.709 --> 05:10.210
That's a lot of guns.

05:10.277 --> 05:11.278
Nice haul.

05:11.345 --> 05:12.413
Yeah, it would've been.

05:12.480 --> 05:14.147
Those boxes are all empty.

05:14.214 --> 05:15.683
I'm guessing your fugitive
walked away

05:15.749 --> 05:17.451
with three dozen
brand-new firearms,

05:17.518 --> 05:19.152
handguns and assault rifles.

05:21.288 --> 05:23.391
The desk clerk says
the Camerons arrived

05:23.457 --> 05:24.792
six days ago from Brooklyn.

05:24.858 --> 05:26.326
The wife has family
in Savannah.

05:26.394 --> 05:27.628
That's their blue Toyota.

05:27.695 --> 05:28.962
Find anything interesting
in the car?

05:29.029 --> 05:30.931
Nothing that raised eyebrows.

05:30.998 --> 05:33.734
Brad Cameron has a gun
conviction in New York.

05:33.801 --> 05:35.603
He served a year
mandatory sentence.

05:35.669 --> 05:36.937
In Brooklyn,
those guns are worth

05:37.004 --> 05:38.472
five times what they are here.

05:38.539 --> 05:40.774
We call I-95
the Iron Pipeline.

05:40.841 --> 05:42.943
Guns traffic
from Florida and Georgia

05:43.010 --> 05:45.178
up the interstate
to cities in the northeast

05:45.245 --> 05:46.380
with tougher gun control.

05:46.447 --> 05:47.948
Yeah, half the
illegal weapons we took

05:48.015 --> 05:50.317
off the street when I was in
NYPD traced back to the South.

05:50.384 --> 05:52.420
Based on the price tags
and the serial numbers,

05:52.486 --> 05:54.822
those boxes are all
from local gun shops.

05:54.888 --> 05:57.057
I got something on the
motel security footage.

05:57.124 --> 05:58.826
A white man trailing
the Camerons

05:58.892 --> 06:00.661
through the breezeway
to their room.

06:03.230 --> 06:06.634
Two minutes later,
he leaves the same way

06:06.700 --> 06:08.101
he came
with two pink suitcases.

06:08.168 --> 06:10.237
They look heavy enough
to be full of guns.

06:10.303 --> 06:12.372
Kristin and I will go talk
to Louanne Cameron's family.

06:12.440 --> 06:14.274
You two canvas those
gun shops for leads.

06:21.181 --> 06:22.816
Do we really
have to do this right now?

06:22.883 --> 06:24.485
I know it's hard,
Ms. Sherman.

06:24.552 --> 06:26.520
But if we wait, the man
who killed your family

06:26.587 --> 06:28.456
has more time to get away.

06:28.522 --> 06:30.924
Yeah, well,
I want that bastard to fry.

06:30.991 --> 06:32.926
Who murders
two innocent children?

06:32.993 --> 06:35.195
I know.
We're very sorry for your loss.

06:35.262 --> 06:36.630
We were told that
your family was

06:36.697 --> 06:38.432
visiting here from New York.

06:38.499 --> 06:41.368
Who else besides the two
of you knew they were in town?

06:41.435 --> 06:43.136
I don't know. Darlene?

06:43.203 --> 06:45.839
Louanne has a few friends
from high school,

06:45.906 --> 06:48.141
but I don't think
they got together.

06:48.208 --> 06:50.578
When was the last time
you saw your family?

06:50.644 --> 06:52.045
Just last night for dinner.

06:54.615 --> 06:56.349
Same for you, Darlene?

06:56.416 --> 06:57.384
Yeah.

06:59.987 --> 07:03.190
The police found gun boxes
in their motel room,

07:03.256 --> 07:04.658
lots of them.

07:04.725 --> 07:07.327
I told Louanne from day one
that Brad was trouble.

07:10.263 --> 07:12.700
Did your sister
mention any guns?

07:12.766 --> 07:15.135
She never said anything
about that.

07:21.709 --> 07:23.110
Can you get Ms. Sherman
another drink

07:23.176 --> 07:25.979
while I talk to Darlene
outside?

07:26.046 --> 07:27.214
Darlene?

07:33.353 --> 07:35.723
Your sister wasn't here
for a friendly visit, was she?

07:35.789 --> 07:37.357
- What do you mean?
- Come on, Darlene.

07:37.424 --> 07:38.926
Help me out.

07:38.992 --> 07:43.196
You were close with your niece
and nephew, Amber and Mason?

07:43.263 --> 07:44.197
I was.

07:45.933 --> 07:48.769
Those poor kids
deserve the truth.

07:48.836 --> 07:51.338
Don't you think?

07:51.404 --> 07:54.508
That's one last thing
you can give to them.

07:56.844 --> 07:58.178
Yeah.

08:00.213 --> 08:02.082
Something you
want to tell me?

08:04.552 --> 08:06.453
Darlene.

08:08.321 --> 08:11.692
Brad came here to buy guns
and take them back north.

08:11.759 --> 08:13.260
He sent me and Louanne
to the shops

08:13.326 --> 08:15.763
'cause we had clean records
and Georgia IDs

08:15.829 --> 08:18.165
so we could buy them legal.

08:18.231 --> 08:20.500
You do realize
that's gun trafficking?

08:20.568 --> 08:23.904
Brad said me and Louanne
weren't breaking any laws.

08:23.971 --> 08:25.205
It was the third trip
he made here,

08:25.272 --> 08:26.740
and we never had any problems.

08:26.807 --> 08:28.141
Do you know this man?

08:29.877 --> 08:32.580
I seen him in the last
gun shop we went to,

08:32.646 --> 08:33.914
eyeing me and Louanne.

08:33.981 --> 08:36.083
Checking you out?

08:36.149 --> 08:37.851
Brad told us
to dress real slutty

08:37.918 --> 08:39.653
when we went to the stores,

08:39.720 --> 08:42.522
said we get better deals
that way.

08:42.590 --> 08:43.957
Am I in trouble?

08:44.024 --> 08:45.492
That's not up to me,
but I'll let them know

08:45.559 --> 08:46.994
you cooperated with us.

08:47.060 --> 08:48.495
I promise you.

08:51.264 --> 08:52.700
Have you seen this woman?

08:52.766 --> 08:53.801
Yep.

08:53.867 --> 08:55.268
She came in with her sister.

08:55.335 --> 08:58.271
Sold her a Wilson Combat AR-15

08:58.338 --> 09:01.274
and a Sig Sauer 9 mil,
six boxes of ammo too.

09:01.341 --> 09:02.943
We heard there was
a customer paying them

09:03.010 --> 09:05.245
some unwanted attention.

09:05.312 --> 09:06.546
I saw that.

09:06.614 --> 09:07.915
Can't say I blame the fella.

09:07.981 --> 09:10.417
I know it's summertime,
but this ain't the beach.

09:10.483 --> 09:12.753
- What about him?
- Yep. That's him.

09:12.820 --> 09:16.356
He was playing with one of my
ARs before the girls came in.

09:16.423 --> 09:18.525
Had a friend with him,
Black guy.

09:18.592 --> 09:19.727
Didn't buy nothing, though.

09:19.793 --> 09:22.129
Which rifle did they handle?

09:22.195 --> 09:24.264
That Ruger on the wall.

09:24.331 --> 09:25.899
We're going to need
to take that for prints.

09:25.966 --> 09:27.668
I get it back, right?

09:27.735 --> 09:30.137
Can't afford to part
with inventory at the moment.

09:30.203 --> 09:32.072
Every time there's a shooting
like that Delaware thing,

09:32.139 --> 09:34.274
we get a line out the door.

09:34.341 --> 09:35.909
Everybody and their granny
wants an AR

09:35.976 --> 09:37.477
while they still can get them.

09:37.544 --> 09:40.113
Nice to hear the murder of
children is good for business.

09:40.180 --> 09:43.583
I mean, poor kids, sure.

09:43.651 --> 09:45.252
But I sell guns for a living.

09:49.389 --> 09:51.591
We're going to need
your security footage too.

09:59.867 --> 10:02.870
Look at this beauty.

10:02.936 --> 10:05.639
What can you get
for that, 1,000?

10:05.706 --> 10:07.174
Are you tripping, son?

10:07.240 --> 10:09.176
Up north, I can get three
or four grand for that.

10:09.242 --> 10:12.012
But I'm keeping her for myself.

10:12.079 --> 10:15.515
Hey, all this,
all this is for us.

10:15.582 --> 10:18.051
I don't know.

10:18.118 --> 10:20.187
I wish we never
followed those girls.

10:20.253 --> 10:22.222
It wasn't supposed
to go down like that.

10:22.289 --> 10:24.457
Dad drew on me,
tried to be a hero.

10:24.524 --> 10:25.592
It was me or him.

10:25.659 --> 10:27.795
The radio said
the whole family's dead.

10:27.861 --> 10:28.862
They saw my face.

10:28.929 --> 10:31.064
Two kids, Walker.

10:31.131 --> 10:34.735
All we can do is make
the best of the situation.

10:34.802 --> 10:35.936
I know a guy in Philly.

10:36.003 --> 10:38.371
We drive up I-95,
unload this whole stash,

10:38.438 --> 10:40.473
we're back here tomorrow,
50k in our pockets.

10:40.540 --> 10:42.075
With the cops looking
for us the whole way.

10:42.142 --> 10:43.543
Looking for me.

10:43.610 --> 10:45.078
They don't know squat
about you.

10:47.014 --> 10:49.482
We'll boost some new plates
for your car, just to be safe.

10:52.319 --> 10:55.155
Come on, Donte, that's more
bank than you'll clear

10:55.222 --> 10:57.224
in a year at that warehouse.

10:59.092 --> 11:00.627
Are you in or out?

11:05.733 --> 11:08.401
Here's our unsub and his
friend at the gun store.

11:08.468 --> 11:10.603
It looks like he followed
Darlene and Louanne

11:10.670 --> 11:12.906
into the motel room to rip off
the two guns they bought.

11:12.973 --> 11:15.342
Then he stumbled onto
Brad's gun trafficking hustle,

11:15.408 --> 11:17.410
and it all goes sideways
when Brad pulls a gun.

11:17.477 --> 11:18.812
Right, but the Black guy
in the shop

11:18.879 --> 11:20.113
never goes into the motel room.

11:20.180 --> 11:21.782
Well, he could still
be an accomplice.

11:21.849 --> 11:23.216
Can we ID them with facial rec?

11:23.283 --> 11:24.584
I'm sure Hannah
already thought of that.

11:24.651 --> 11:27.387
I did try.
The images were too degraded.

11:27.454 --> 11:30.157
But we do have fingerprints
on the assault rifle.

11:30.223 --> 11:32.192
We got four hits.

11:32.259 --> 11:33.660
And there is our shooter--

11:33.727 --> 11:35.729
Walker Hawley of Philadelphia.

11:35.796 --> 11:37.397
Three convictions
in Pennsylvania,

11:37.464 --> 11:39.666
a couple of bar assaults,
resisting arrest.

11:39.733 --> 11:42.569
He's more like a hothead
than a murderer.

11:42.635 --> 11:44.104
All right.
What's he doing in Georgia?

11:44.171 --> 11:47.007
He went to Statesboro
junior college a few years ago.

11:47.074 --> 11:48.275
He played on their
football team.

11:48.341 --> 11:49.642
He roomed in a frat house
on campus.

11:49.709 --> 11:51.444
Have local PD check
into the fraternity.

11:51.511 --> 11:53.113
Maybe somebody there can
put a name to Hawley's

11:53.180 --> 11:54.114
friend from the gun shop.

11:57.017 --> 11:58.886
That's my nephew, Donte.

11:58.952 --> 12:00.153
Donte Colson.

12:00.220 --> 12:01.588
Do you know
where he is right now?

12:01.654 --> 12:03.423
I haven't seen him
since last night.

12:03.490 --> 12:05.993
Does your nephew
know a Walker Hawley

12:06.059 --> 12:07.594
from his fraternity at college?

12:07.660 --> 12:09.562
Yeah, he's here visiting
from up north.

12:09.629 --> 12:11.231
Was Hawley here
last night too?

12:11.298 --> 12:12.465
Yeah, they were both in there

12:12.532 --> 12:14.167
watching the game
before I turned in.

12:16.036 --> 12:17.470
Is Donte okay?

12:17.537 --> 12:20.140
How well do you know
Walker Hawley?

12:20.207 --> 12:22.109
Well, I don't
know him at all.

12:22.175 --> 12:24.177
But if he's a friend
of my nephew's, then--

12:24.244 --> 12:27.214
Walker's got Donte
into some serious trouble.

12:27.280 --> 12:29.349
And we need to find them
as soon as possible.

12:31.084 --> 12:32.219
I don't know where they went.

12:34.754 --> 12:36.223
All right, listen,
Mr. Colson, we're--

12:36.289 --> 12:38.491
we're going to need you
to help us help him, okay?

12:38.558 --> 12:41.094
His friend, Walker,
has already killed four people.

12:41.161 --> 12:43.096
Don't let Donte be next.

12:56.977 --> 12:59.046
Hey, what's up,
Uncle Ezekiel?

12:59.112 --> 13:00.313
You boys coming home
for dinner?

13:00.380 --> 13:01.614
No, we're not gonna make it.

13:01.681 --> 13:03.516
I gotta drive Walker
back to Philly.

13:03.583 --> 13:06.854
Well, why don't you come home
and eat before you go?

13:06.920 --> 13:08.355
<i>We're already on the road.</i>

13:13.626 --> 13:14.394
Where about?

13:14.461 --> 13:17.230
I-95 in South Carolina.

13:17.297 --> 13:19.599
Hey!
What the hell are you doing?

13:19.666 --> 13:21.935
Donte? Donte?

13:22.002 --> 13:24.337
Get off at the next exit.

13:24.404 --> 13:26.573
We're gonna find
another way into Philly.

13:29.843 --> 13:32.079
I got a bead on the
phone number his uncle gave us.

13:32.145 --> 13:35.248
It pinged in a tower in
Saint George in South Carolina.

13:35.315 --> 13:37.617
Then it went dead.
- They tossed the phone.

13:37.684 --> 13:38.952
Looks that way.

13:39.019 --> 13:40.220
Let's put a BOLO out
on the car

13:40.287 --> 13:41.721
and flag their credit cards.
- On it.

13:41.788 --> 13:43.790
They're on their way
to Philadelphia.

13:43.857 --> 13:45.392
I'll fly ahead with Kris,
and we'll try to figure out

13:45.458 --> 13:46.826
where they're headed.

13:46.894 --> 13:49.863
You grab Agent Peele
and chase them north on I-95.

13:49.930 --> 13:51.298
Hey, why don't
you take Sheryll,

13:51.364 --> 13:53.233
let me ride with the ATF guy?

13:53.300 --> 13:54.701
Yeah. That works too.

13:54.767 --> 13:56.069
Barnes is crazy about me.

13:56.136 --> 13:57.170
Right, Sheryll?

13:57.237 --> 14:00.007
Yeah, right.

14:00.073 --> 14:01.641
They got
a 90-mile head start.

14:01.708 --> 14:02.642
What are you gonna do?

14:02.709 --> 14:03.776
Drive fast.

14:08.115 --> 14:09.582
Hey, I--

14:09.649 --> 14:11.051
We stay off the highway
till we hit Maryland.

14:11.118 --> 14:12.986
You want something to drink?

14:13.053 --> 14:14.321
Iced tea.

14:14.387 --> 14:15.522
Pay with cash.

14:30.037 --> 14:31.704
Hey, let me get one of
those scratch and wins.

14:46.954 --> 14:48.888
Hands in the air!

14:48.956 --> 14:52.159
Place your hands on the
top of your vehicle!

14:52.225 --> 14:54.494
Now!

15:02.135 --> 15:03.270
God bless
the Second Amendment.

15:03.336 --> 15:05.205
Go, go, go! Let's go!

15:14.914 --> 15:16.183
State trooper spotted
them gassing up.

15:16.249 --> 15:17.684
The car didn't match
the plates on the BOLO,

15:17.750 --> 15:19.319
but he decided to check it out,
and they ambushed him,

15:19.386 --> 15:20.820
<i>probably with one of the
stolen assault rifles.</i>

15:20.887 --> 15:22.089
How far are you from Philly?

15:22.155 --> 15:23.790
Eight hours, give or take.

15:23.856 --> 15:25.125
They've got a full tank of gas

15:25.192 --> 15:26.459
and half a dozen
different routes into the city.

15:26.526 --> 15:27.927
Pick one and get here ASAP.

15:27.995 --> 15:29.429
You on your way
to Hawley's house?

15:29.496 --> 15:30.930
We just left there.

15:30.998 --> 15:32.532
Neighbor says he hasn't been
home in a couple of weeks.

15:32.599 --> 15:34.501
Found a motorcycle
in his garage, though,

15:34.567 --> 15:35.735
total crotch rocket.

15:35.802 --> 15:37.737
Light, fast, super cheap.

15:37.804 --> 15:38.871
<i>Good way
to get himself killed.</i>

15:38.938 --> 15:40.407
Wouldn't that be nice?

15:40.473 --> 15:42.675
Posted a surveillance team
just in case he comes back.

15:42.742 --> 15:44.811
Hannah's digging
into his social media.

15:44.877 --> 15:46.546
<i>We'll see you soon.
- All right.</i>

15:53.353 --> 15:56.056
I need to pull off
and make a pit stop.

15:56.123 --> 15:57.690
You should've gone
at the gas station.

15:57.757 --> 15:59.259
While you wasted that cop?

16:02.462 --> 16:06.133
Would you rather spend
the rest of your life in jail?

16:06.199 --> 16:08.101
I didn't have a choice.

16:11.371 --> 16:13.206
Use this.

16:13.273 --> 16:15.275
I'm not taking a leak
in a damn bottle.

16:53.012 --> 16:55.748
You son of a bitch.

17:26.613 --> 17:29.216
I got the names of
possible criminal associates

17:29.282 --> 17:30.517
from Hawley's
probation officer.

17:30.583 --> 17:31.784
Six live in the area.

17:31.851 --> 17:33.586
Have local PD
sit on those addresses.

17:33.653 --> 17:34.921
Any luck on social media?

17:34.987 --> 17:36.856
Hawley has nearly a hundred
Facebook friends,

17:36.923 --> 17:38.057
so it's gonna take a minute

17:38.125 --> 17:39.526
to pinpoint exactly
where they are.

17:39.592 --> 17:41.794
Cross-check them with Barnes'
names and keep grinding.

17:41.861 --> 17:45.398
We need to find out where he's
headed with those damn guns.

17:45.465 --> 17:47.300
<i>I want to send
my thoughts and prayers</i>

17:47.367 --> 17:48.535
<i>to the families of the victims</i>

17:48.601 --> 17:50.637
<i>of the Wilmington Camp tragedy.</i>

17:50.703 --> 17:53.606
<i>As we mourn the loss
of these young lives</i>

17:53.673 --> 17:57.244
<i>and offer condolences to the
families torn apart by this,</i>

17:57.310 --> 18:00.280
<i>let's also keep in mind
that the perpetrator was</i>

18:00.347 --> 18:02.782
<i>a deranged individual who
had fallen through the cracks</i>

18:02.849 --> 18:04.751
<i>of our mental health system.</i>

18:04.817 --> 18:06.953
<i>It wasn't a gun that
killed these children.</i>

18:07.019 --> 18:09.956
<i>It was an evil,
disturbed young man.</i>

18:10.022 --> 18:10.957
<i>These comments by...</i>

18:11.023 --> 18:12.959
Everything okay?

18:14.661 --> 18:15.862
He always like this?

18:15.928 --> 18:19.166
- Like what?
- Rude.

18:19.232 --> 18:21.134
Uh, Kristin said
there might be something

18:21.201 --> 18:23.236
going on with his mother,
but I'm staying out of it.

18:25.872 --> 18:27.640
They had a room
ready that fast?

18:27.707 --> 18:30.510
Yeah.
I--I'm moving her in right now.

18:30.577 --> 18:32.011
How's she holding up?

18:35.448 --> 18:37.984
I don't know
if I can do this, Remy.

18:38.050 --> 18:40.953
It's just so sad.

18:41.020 --> 18:43.590
It's gonna be okay.

18:43.656 --> 18:45.091
It's the right thing to do.

18:48.195 --> 18:49.462
Listen, I got another call.

18:49.529 --> 18:52.299
I'll--I'll check in
with you later.

18:53.833 --> 18:54.834
Remy Scott.

18:54.901 --> 18:57.170
Yeah, this is Ezekiel Colson,

18:57.237 --> 18:59.105
<i>Donte Colson's uncle.</i>

18:59.172 --> 19:00.573
<i>I need to tell you something.</i>

19:02.542 --> 19:05.345
What can I do for you,
Mr. Colson?

19:05.412 --> 19:07.880
My nephew, he wants
to turn himself in.

19:07.947 --> 19:09.849
Okay, that's good.

19:09.916 --> 19:11.351
Where is he?

19:11.418 --> 19:13.085
The officer said
a hunter found him

19:13.152 --> 19:16.155
out there in the woods,
gunshot in his shoulder.

19:16.223 --> 19:17.557
They didn't know who they
were dealing with

19:17.624 --> 19:19.592
until his uncle hauled ass
up here from Georgia.

19:19.659 --> 19:22.662
- He sign a Miranda waiver?
- Yeah. Right here.

19:22.729 --> 19:25.332
Donte, Agent Gaines
with the FBI.

19:25.398 --> 19:27.834
He'll talk to you as long
as I can stay and listen in.

19:27.900 --> 19:29.236
That'll work for now.

19:29.302 --> 19:31.070
Can you tell us who shot you?

19:31.137 --> 19:33.306
Walker Hawley.

19:33.373 --> 19:35.708
We were on our way to Philly
with the guns he stole.

19:35.775 --> 19:37.610
He stole, not you.

19:37.677 --> 19:40.513
The plan we had was
to follow the girls

19:40.580 --> 19:42.582
and rob the two guns
they had just bought.

19:42.649 --> 19:43.616
What's wrong with you?

19:46.018 --> 19:47.320
I stayed in the car
when Walker

19:47.387 --> 19:49.222
went into the motel room.

19:49.289 --> 19:51.358
Next thing, I hear gunshots
and Walker comes running

19:51.424 --> 19:53.192
with two suitcases,
and it turns out that

19:53.260 --> 19:56.329
they're full with guns,
rifles too.

19:57.664 --> 20:00.600
He told me
if I drive him north,

20:00.667 --> 20:02.435
we could sell them
and split the money.

20:02.502 --> 20:04.871
Where is he going
to sell them?

20:04.937 --> 20:08.308
All I know is that
there's a guy named Teddy.

20:08.375 --> 20:10.076
He's got a shop somewhere
outside of Philly.

20:10.142 --> 20:12.945
Fixes motorcycles.

20:13.012 --> 20:15.982
I just want you to know I--

20:16.048 --> 20:17.650
I didn't shoot that family.

20:17.717 --> 20:19.319
I swear to the Lord.

20:19.386 --> 20:22.255
What about the cop
at the gas station?

20:22.322 --> 20:25.958
That was Walker, all of it.

20:30.397 --> 20:32.965
Teddy from Philadelphia
isn't much of a lead.

20:33.032 --> 20:36.669
Look for anything related
to motorcycle repair shops.

20:39.406 --> 20:42.275
Yep. Nothing on the helmet.

20:42.342 --> 20:46.112
45¢ and some coke.

20:54.887 --> 20:56.255
Got it.

20:56.323 --> 20:58.958
Franklin Bridge Motorcycles,
Camden, New Jersey.

20:59.025 --> 21:00.760
That's across the river
from Philly.

21:00.827 --> 21:02.862
So what's the play here?

21:02.929 --> 21:04.997
Call our stagecraft unit
in Philadelphia and tell them

21:05.064 --> 21:06.833
I need a Harley cruiser.

21:06.899 --> 21:08.134
I'm going undercover.

21:08.200 --> 21:09.836
That doesn't sound
like a good idea.

21:09.902 --> 21:11.203
We don't know when
or where Walker's gonna

21:11.270 --> 21:13.005
connect with this guy.

21:13.072 --> 21:14.741
We--we can sit on Teddy
for weeks,

21:14.807 --> 21:16.676
or we can make things
happen now.

21:16.743 --> 21:18.811
Also, a helmet with some wear
and tear and a street gun.

21:18.878 --> 21:20.547
So you're gonna go
to the shop by yourself

21:20.613 --> 21:22.582
without backup
or electronic monitoring?

21:22.649 --> 21:25.117
I'll grab a GPS tracker,
and you can keep tabs on me.

21:25.184 --> 21:26.753
And I need it here in an hour.
- Okay.

21:26.819 --> 21:28.355
These people
are arms dealers, Remy.

21:28.421 --> 21:30.357
Who knows what kind of
weapons they might have?

21:30.423 --> 21:32.191
- It doesn't matter.
- It does matter!

21:34.627 --> 21:37.430
Jess would never do something
this reckless.

21:39.866 --> 21:42.435
Jess got shot.

21:42.502 --> 21:46.305
And if that's still in your
head, we got a problem.

21:46.373 --> 21:49.108
Things have changed
since you left, Barnes.

21:51.077 --> 21:53.212
And I ain't Jess.

22:15.334 --> 22:16.869
How's it going?

22:16.936 --> 22:19.472
You want the polite answer
or the real answer?

22:19.539 --> 22:23.710
Yeah. I get it.

22:23.776 --> 22:26.679
My bike needs some work.

22:26.746 --> 22:27.914
What kinda work?

22:27.980 --> 22:30.417
I don't know.
The clutch is sticky.

22:30.483 --> 22:31.818
Maybe I need new rotor.

22:31.884 --> 22:33.553
I can't figure it out.
- Yeah, that's no problem.

22:33.620 --> 22:35.154
Just come back next week,
and I'll hook you up.

22:35.221 --> 22:36.689
Yeah, my boy says
he doesn't let anyone

22:36.756 --> 22:38.958
touch his rooster except Teddy.

22:40.727 --> 22:42.962
No offense.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:43.029 --> 22:44.664
Teddy's at the bar
on the corner.

22:44.731 --> 22:46.533
Appreciate it.

22:54.306 --> 22:55.341
Can I get a draft?

22:59.479 --> 23:03.115
Oh, I love this song.

23:05.685 --> 23:07.687
Sup?

23:07.754 --> 23:09.656
Teddy, right?

23:09.722 --> 23:10.990
Do I know you?

23:11.057 --> 23:13.726
Your girl from the shop
said you'd be here.

23:13.793 --> 23:16.496
My bike needs some work.

23:16.563 --> 23:17.864
What do you ride?

23:17.930 --> 23:20.099
Softail Fat Bob.

23:20.166 --> 23:21.968
Nice.
Bring it by the shop next week.

23:22.034 --> 23:23.402
That's what your girl said,

23:23.470 --> 23:26.806
but I was hoping that
you could fit me in sooner.

23:26.873 --> 23:28.475
Another for my friend here?

23:28.541 --> 23:30.142
It's gonna cost you
a lot more than a beer.

23:30.209 --> 23:32.479
It's all good.

23:35.114 --> 23:37.316
Hey, um,

23:37.383 --> 23:40.987
what if I was
looking for something

23:41.053 --> 23:42.955
a little more than a tune-up?

23:43.022 --> 23:45.057
Like what?

23:45.124 --> 23:47.527
Word on the street
is that you can get me

23:47.594 --> 23:51.430
a couple of 15s and biscuits.

23:51.498 --> 23:54.867
I don't know what
you're talking about, bro.

23:54.934 --> 23:57.203
Hey. All good in the wood.

23:57.269 --> 23:58.538
Guess I got the wrong dude.

24:00.607 --> 24:01.974
Hold on a second.

24:03.776 --> 24:05.177
Mm.

24:12.384 --> 24:13.319
Mm-kay.

24:18.090 --> 24:21.327
Looks like the merch
you're after is available.

24:21.393 --> 24:22.361
12k.

24:22.428 --> 24:26.533
Oh, killing me.

24:26.599 --> 24:28.134
I could do 10 max.

24:28.200 --> 24:32.772
And I need factory
fresh product, not used.

24:32.839 --> 24:34.473
That's gonna run you 15.

24:34.541 --> 24:37.977
Bro.

24:38.044 --> 24:39.612
Split the difference?

24:39.679 --> 24:40.913
No.

24:40.980 --> 24:43.816
Meet me at my shop tomorrow,
9:00 a.m.

24:43.883 --> 24:46.085
If you're late,
the price goes up.

24:55.227 --> 24:57.163
Teddy left the bar
and walked back to his shop.

24:57.229 --> 24:58.164
He's still in there.

24:58.230 --> 24:59.866
And no sign of Hawley.

24:59.932 --> 25:01.901
<i>If there's no Hawley,
there's no guns.</i>

25:01.968 --> 25:03.102
Something's off.

25:03.169 --> 25:04.937
Could be he got
delayed on the road.

25:05.004 --> 25:06.973
Our Philly officer
signed off on the cash.

25:07.039 --> 25:08.207
Let's stick to the script.

25:08.274 --> 25:10.543
I wish you'd reconsider
wearing a wire.

25:10.610 --> 25:12.078
Let it go, Barnes.

25:12.144 --> 25:15.114
If Teddy finds out, our whole
operation is compromised.

25:16.783 --> 25:17.950
Just try and get some sleep.

25:18.017 --> 25:19.786
Yeah, right.

25:19.852 --> 25:21.053
I'm so wired.

25:21.120 --> 25:22.221
<i>Kristin's headed your way.</i>

25:22.288 --> 25:24.757
I'm out. Talk tomorrow.

25:37.036 --> 25:38.671
Right on time.

25:38.738 --> 25:39.739
You got the money?

25:39.806 --> 25:41.140
If you got the hardware.

25:41.207 --> 25:43.542
I do indeed.
Let's go for a ride.

25:43.610 --> 25:45.344
Where to?

25:45.411 --> 25:47.614
I don't keep that kinda
inventory in my shop.

25:50.883 --> 25:52.619
Follow me.

25:59.592 --> 26:02.729
Two bikes on the move
coming your way.

26:02.795 --> 26:04.263
Copy that.

26:04.330 --> 26:06.298
Hannah, keep us in striking
distance, but not too close.

26:06.365 --> 26:09.235
They're heading south
on Route 47 out of the city.

26:11.303 --> 26:12.972
I don't like this.

26:44.336 --> 26:46.205
Another satisfied customer.

26:58.751 --> 27:00.753
Be nice if you told me
we were riding out

27:00.820 --> 27:02.121
to the boondocks.

27:03.923 --> 27:05.257
Make yourself comfortable.

27:05.324 --> 27:08.427
<i>Me casa es su casa.</i>

27:08.494 --> 27:10.096
Let's get down to business.

27:10.162 --> 27:11.798
I got to get back
to my old lady.

27:11.864 --> 27:14.133
There's no business.

27:14.200 --> 27:15.534
We want your money.

27:28.948 --> 27:30.182
Look what I found.

27:30.249 --> 27:33.519
I thought you came here
to buy guns.

27:33.585 --> 27:34.887
You a cop?

27:34.954 --> 27:36.588
If that was, would I be
out here by myself?

27:36.655 --> 27:39.458
Where's the cash?

27:39.525 --> 27:40.893
In my boot.

27:43.429 --> 27:44.630
Easy, baby girl.

27:53.339 --> 27:54.440
It's all here.

27:57.043 --> 27:59.211
I held up my own.
How about you do the same?

27:59.278 --> 28:01.680
Get the hell out of here,
and you keep your mouth shut.

28:01.748 --> 28:03.950
Consider yourself lucky.

28:04.016 --> 28:05.785
If you were on a bike,
you'd be dead already.

28:10.723 --> 28:13.392
Karma's a bitch.

28:13.459 --> 28:15.127
<i>Ciao bella.</i>

28:31.510 --> 28:33.212
The Philly office
will have a good laugh

28:33.279 --> 28:35.481
when they hear a New York
hotshot lost their buy money.

28:35.547 --> 28:38.017
They'll get it back when
they take down the trailer.

28:38.084 --> 28:40.286
Sounds like it was fortunate
that's all you lost.

28:40.352 --> 28:41.687
Hey, it all worked out--
if I hadn't been there,

28:41.754 --> 28:43.923
I never would've spotted
the suitcase.

28:43.990 --> 28:45.057
Fair enough.

28:45.124 --> 28:46.893
Okay. Where's the other one?

28:46.959 --> 28:48.660
My guess is,
that's why they robbed me.

28:48.727 --> 28:50.662
Now they have enough capital
to pay for the second half

28:50.729 --> 28:52.164
of Hawley's stash.

28:52.231 --> 28:54.700
Which means they have
to connect with him again.

28:54.767 --> 28:56.268
Teddy's bike is on the move.

28:56.335 --> 28:59.171
Okay, we got Teddy.
Have ATF move on the trailer.

28:59.238 --> 29:00.739
All right. Be nice to have
SWAT back us up.

29:00.807 --> 29:01.707
We don't know
where they're going.

29:01.774 --> 29:03.142
We're likely to be outgunned.

29:03.209 --> 29:04.811
We don't have time to sit
around and wait for them.

29:04.877 --> 29:07.814
This is on us.

29:07.880 --> 29:09.515
Everybody good?

29:30.436 --> 29:32.371
Got that money quick.

29:32.438 --> 29:34.173
What'd you do,
rob a bank or something?

29:38.710 --> 29:40.446
Teddy's got company.

29:40.512 --> 29:41.914
It's Hawley in Colson's car.

29:45.051 --> 29:46.953
Hana, T-bone the access road
and box them in.

29:47.019 --> 29:48.720
Calvary's coming.
<i>- Copy that.</i>

29:55.694 --> 29:57.063
Where's the ammo?

29:57.129 --> 29:58.931
- Batteries not included.
- Ah.

29:58.998 --> 30:00.632
You want the guns or not?

30:00.699 --> 30:02.701
I can't take that on my bike.

30:02.768 --> 30:04.203
Follow me home.

30:13.913 --> 30:15.381
- FBI!
- FBI! Drop your weapon!

30:15.447 --> 30:16.715
On the ground!
Let me see your hands!

30:16.782 --> 30:18.350
Don't move!

30:21.653 --> 30:23.122
He's reloading.

30:27.026 --> 30:29.761
Drop your weapon!

30:42.641 --> 30:43.876
Everyone all right?

30:43.943 --> 30:45.144
We're good.

30:55.287 --> 30:57.756
We took down the trailer
and arrested Teddy's partner.

30:57.823 --> 30:58.991
She put up a fight?

30:59.058 --> 31:00.126
Claimed that
she didn't know anything

31:00.192 --> 31:01.460
about any guns in the place.

31:01.527 --> 31:03.295
She won't be happy when
she sees my smiling face.

31:03.362 --> 31:05.064
Between here
and the trailer,

31:05.131 --> 31:06.665
we recovered all the
Georgia firearms,

31:06.732 --> 31:07.967
except for one FN SCAR.

31:08.034 --> 31:09.568
Pretty sure it was
purchased this morning

31:09.635 --> 31:10.669
by a guy in a minivan.

31:10.736 --> 31:17.009
Hana, Delaware plates, 472V5U.

31:18.577 --> 31:22.648
Registered to a Joshua
Fogelman, Wilmington address.

31:22.714 --> 31:24.850
I'll get a warrant,
have my people head over there.

31:24.917 --> 31:27.853
Why is that name familiar?

31:27.920 --> 31:30.056
That's why--his daughter, Maya,

31:30.122 --> 31:31.457
was one of the children
who was murdered

31:31.523 --> 31:32.524
in the Delaware shooting.

31:32.591 --> 31:34.126
Yeah, he's been
all over the news

31:34.193 --> 31:35.794
advocating for gun control, right?

31:35.861 --> 31:37.229
Okay, so what's
he doing buying

31:37.296 --> 31:38.564
a trafficked assault rifle?
- Damn good question.

31:38.630 --> 31:40.632
Saddle up.
We're not going home just yet.

31:47.606 --> 31:50.109
<i>My daughter, Maya,
was making a clay duck</i>

31:50.176 --> 31:55.447
<i>in the arts and crafts shack
when she was murdered</i>

31:55.514 --> 31:59.251
<i>with a legally-obtained
military-grade assault rifle.</i>

31:59.318 --> 32:03.722
<i>We don't need thoughts
and prayers or a GoFundMe</i>

32:03.789 --> 32:04.756
<i>for her funeral.</i>

32:04.823 --> 32:08.294
<i>We want someone to stop this--</i>

32:08.360 --> 32:10.362
<i>this madness.</i>

32:12.531 --> 32:16.768
Joshua would never buy a gun,
particularly an assault rifle.

32:16.835 --> 32:19.905
I saw him with my own eyes.

32:19.972 --> 32:22.474
That doesn't make sense.

32:22.541 --> 32:25.644
Where's Joshua now?

32:25.711 --> 32:27.946
He drove
to a media appearance

32:28.014 --> 32:30.116
in Pittsburgh this morning.

32:30.182 --> 32:33.119
He says that's how
he's gonna get through this,

32:33.185 --> 32:38.090
by speaking out
and trying to change things.

32:38.157 --> 32:41.027
He's like a man on fire.

32:41.093 --> 32:43.762
And I can barely get out
of bed in the morning.

32:45.964 --> 32:48.400
I know condolences don't
mean much at times like this,

32:48.467 --> 32:51.770
but we are very sorry about
what happened to Maya.

32:51.837 --> 32:54.906
I actually know how
your husband feels.

32:54.973 --> 32:57.609
I lost my brother
to a senseless act of violence.

32:59.345 --> 33:02.681
What kind of appearance
is Joshua doing in Pittsburgh?

33:05.684 --> 33:08.487
I'm really not sure.

33:08.554 --> 33:12.158
Would you mind if I
took a look at his laptop?

33:12.224 --> 33:14.793
I suppose that's okay.

33:18.597 --> 33:20.466
Thank you.

33:20.532 --> 33:21.533
Okay.

33:21.600 --> 33:23.069
I'm in his search history.

33:24.736 --> 33:26.305
The Northeastern
Rifle Federation

33:26.372 --> 33:29.341
is having its annual meeting
today in Pittsburgh.

33:29.408 --> 33:32.044
Josh is probably doing
an interview about that.

33:32.111 --> 33:34.646
There is a video
he watched recently,

33:34.713 --> 33:37.216
"How to Load and Operate
an AR-15."

33:39.518 --> 33:40.819
Call him.

33:50.629 --> 33:52.131
He's not picking up.

33:52.198 --> 33:54.466
Josh was not in Pittsburgh
to do an interview.

33:54.533 --> 33:56.102
He's there to make a point.

33:56.168 --> 33:57.803
Like you said,
he's a man on fire.

33:57.869 --> 34:00.172
What time
did he leave this morning?

34:00.239 --> 34:01.373
Around 6:00.

34:01.440 --> 34:03.142
We can beat him there
on the jet.

34:05.244 --> 34:07.746
There's no way
I'm postponing the program.

34:07.813 --> 34:10.048
We have 800 members here
from ten states.

34:10.116 --> 34:11.683
My keynote is in 40 minutes.

34:11.750 --> 34:13.352
There's an armed man
on his way here

34:13.419 --> 34:15.087
to disrupt the convention.

34:15.154 --> 34:17.423
Probably some troll online
blowing off steam.

34:17.489 --> 34:18.790
A man whose daughter
was killed with the kind

34:18.857 --> 34:19.958
of weapon you celebrate.

34:20.025 --> 34:22.161
I can't be
concerned with that.

34:22.228 --> 34:24.830
Besides, concealed carry
is the law of the land now.

34:24.896 --> 34:26.798
Most of our members
will be armed

34:26.865 --> 34:28.234
and prepared to self-defend.

34:28.300 --> 34:29.735
I am not letting
this convention turn

34:29.801 --> 34:30.869
into a Wild West shootout.

34:30.936 --> 34:32.538
The lobby's filling up.

34:32.604 --> 34:33.839
We've got to clear that crowd
one way or another.

34:33.905 --> 34:35.374
You have two choices--

34:35.441 --> 34:36.708
call this off or be arrested

34:36.775 --> 34:38.244
for obstructing
a federal officer.

34:38.310 --> 34:39.845
You wouldn't dare--

34:39.911 --> 34:41.613
Cuff Mr. Cox and remove him
from the venue.

34:41.680 --> 34:43.549
Okay. Okay.

34:43.615 --> 34:44.616
You win.

34:44.683 --> 34:48.554
Okay, just--just take it easy.

34:48.620 --> 34:50.956
Fogelman's here and still
can do a lot of damage.

34:51.022 --> 34:52.424
Spread out, and let's find him

34:52.491 --> 34:54.360
before we have another
mass shooting on our hands.

35:08.140 --> 35:10.776
<i>Due to unforeseen circumstances,</i>

35:10.842 --> 35:13.078
<i>today's event
has been postponed.</i>

35:13.145 --> 35:15.080
<i>Please find your way
to the nearest exit</i>

35:15.147 --> 35:18.384
<i>and log on to the NRF
website for updates.</i>

35:18.450 --> 35:19.585
<i>We apologize for...</i>

35:19.651 --> 35:21.420
The FBI just shut us down.

35:21.487 --> 35:24.055
I need to speak to
Senator Weston immediately.

35:24.122 --> 35:25.457
No. No.

35:25.524 --> 35:26.958
I can't wait for a callback.

35:27.025 --> 35:29.495
This is urgent.

35:29.561 --> 35:32.231
The FBI just marched into our--

35:32.298 --> 35:33.432
what?

35:33.499 --> 35:34.633
Forget the Second Amendment.

35:34.700 --> 35:36.202
What about the First Amendment?

35:36.268 --> 35:38.770
What gives them the authority
to just march in here--

35:41.440 --> 35:42.708
Drop the phone.

35:47.779 --> 35:48.947
I don't know who you are,

35:49.014 --> 35:50.949
but you are making
a huge mistake.

35:51.016 --> 35:52.318
Get in there.

35:57.456 --> 35:59.425
Over there.

35:59.491 --> 36:00.459
Sit.

36:03.329 --> 36:04.930
Sit down.

36:15.541 --> 36:16.675
Do you have a gun?

36:16.742 --> 36:18.210
No.

36:21.179 --> 36:23.482
If I find one,
I'm gonna shoot you.

36:25.351 --> 36:27.919
- It's in my ankle hol--
- Don't touch it.

36:29.955 --> 36:32.090
Put your hands on the table.

36:34.393 --> 36:35.727
Got him.

36:35.794 --> 36:37.996
Dressing room, backstage.

36:38.063 --> 36:39.731
What do you want?

36:39.798 --> 36:41.567
It's very simple, Mr. Cox.

36:45.003 --> 36:48.307
I want to show you
a photograph.

36:48.374 --> 36:50.476
It's a crime scene photo
of my daughter, Maya,

36:50.542 --> 36:53.078
courtesy of the
Delaware State Police.

36:57.182 --> 36:58.484
I am very sorry
for your loss.

36:58.550 --> 37:02.053
That's what happens
when eight rounds

37:02.120 --> 37:04.089
from an assault rifle
like this one explode

37:04.155 --> 37:05.824
into a nine-year-old child.

37:08.894 --> 37:11.430
I can't even bring myself
to look at it.

37:15.667 --> 37:17.903
That bad, huh?

37:20.238 --> 37:21.807
You're gonna project this
on the big screen

37:21.873 --> 37:23.442
out there when you speak.

37:23.509 --> 37:26.445
I couldn't do that,
even if I wanted to.

37:26.512 --> 37:27.613
They canceled the event.

37:29.615 --> 37:31.583
Joshua Fogelman?

37:31.650 --> 37:32.818
FBI.

37:32.884 --> 37:34.620
I have Peter Cox in here.

37:34.686 --> 37:37.088
If you come through the door,
I'm gonna kill him.

37:37.155 --> 37:38.690
You don't want to do that.

37:38.757 --> 37:40.191
I'm serious.

37:40.258 --> 37:43.562
I'm ready to die
and take this devil with me.

37:43.629 --> 37:45.297
Nobody's gonna die today.

37:45.364 --> 37:46.298
What do you want?

37:49.067 --> 37:51.737
His phone is out there
on the ground.

37:51.803 --> 37:53.305
Slide it under the door.

37:55.173 --> 37:56.475
What do you think?

37:59.210 --> 38:00.612
Kristin?

38:00.679 --> 38:02.548
I mean, for all we know,
he wants to call his wife.

38:02.614 --> 38:05.817
The last thing we want
to do is piss him off.

38:05.884 --> 38:07.453
Yeah, I say we do it.

38:12.157 --> 38:13.825
It's coming through.

38:23.134 --> 38:25.203
What now, Joshua?

38:25.270 --> 38:26.838
There's only
one way to end this

38:26.905 --> 38:28.106
where I don't kill this man.

38:28.173 --> 38:29.875
Okay, what's that?

38:29.941 --> 38:33.645
The NRF has
400,000 followers.

38:33.712 --> 38:39.418
If Mr. Cox posts the photo
to their feed, I'll surrender.

38:39.485 --> 38:40.486
What photo?

38:43.021 --> 38:44.456
My dead daughter.

38:51.162 --> 38:53.131
You want the whole world
to see that?

38:53.198 --> 38:55.000
I want the people
who back you to see

38:55.066 --> 38:57.703
the carnage they perpetuate.

38:57.769 --> 39:00.439
Next time they send money,
they might think twice.

39:04.976 --> 39:08.079
I just sent you the photo.

39:08.146 --> 39:11.082
I follow your feed,
so don't play games.

39:11.149 --> 39:13.118
You have 30 seconds.

39:55.861 --> 39:57.796
Back away from the gun.

39:57.863 --> 40:00.666
Back away! Sit down.

40:00.732 --> 40:02.033
Stay there.

40:11.477 --> 40:12.410
Good call.

40:21.453 --> 40:22.688
Hi.

40:22.754 --> 40:24.122
Can you tell me what room
Betsy Scott's in?

40:24.189 --> 40:25.491
I'm her son, Remy.

40:25.557 --> 40:27.225
Well, it's nice
to meet you, Remy.

40:27.292 --> 40:29.260
She's told us all about you.

40:29.327 --> 40:30.762
You're a policeman, right?

40:30.829 --> 40:33.231
Something like that.
What room, please?

40:33.298 --> 40:35.366
It's 307, but she's
not there right now.

40:35.433 --> 40:36.902
Everything okay?
Where is she?

40:36.968 --> 40:38.236
Oh, it's fine.

40:38.303 --> 40:40.005
She's just in the game room,
down the hall,

40:40.071 --> 40:41.106
around the corner,
to the right.

40:41.172 --> 40:43.542
- Okay. Thanks.
- You're welcome.

40:43.609 --> 40:45.611
Claire.

40:45.677 --> 40:47.513
Hey.
- What are you doing here?

40:47.579 --> 40:49.981
I don't want
our family torn apart.

40:50.048 --> 40:52.050
I think we made a mistake.

40:52.117 --> 40:53.384
I did too.

40:53.451 --> 40:55.153
I couldn't sleep last night.

40:55.220 --> 40:56.922
I was so worried about her.

40:56.988 --> 40:59.558
But you should see this.

41:01.259 --> 41:02.694
Is that dominoes?

41:02.761 --> 41:04.262
Mm-hmm.

41:04.329 --> 41:06.197
Mom doesn't play dominoes.

41:06.264 --> 41:08.266
I don't think they care.

41:10.769 --> 41:12.838
Should she be drinking?

41:12.904 --> 41:14.973
Probably not.

41:15.040 --> 41:16.141
You want to tell her?

41:16.207 --> 41:17.743
Yeah, right.

41:17.809 --> 41:19.310
I got to tell you, if she's
looking to get married again,

41:19.377 --> 41:21.146
I like her chances.

41:24.049 --> 41:26.017
It's gonna be okay.
