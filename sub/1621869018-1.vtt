00:27.600 --> 00:40.747
And I am counting down from
five, four, three, two and one.

00:40.780 --> 00:43.716
You are now asleep.

00:43.750 --> 00:45.051
Can you hear me?

00:45.085 --> 00:47.422
Yes.

00:50.923 --> 00:52.893
And do
you understand me?

00:58.531 --> 01:00.066
Of course.

01:01.534 --> 01:04.471
Is there anyone else
with you Jeanne?

01:07.274 --> 01:10.510
Yes.

01:10.543 --> 01:13.581
Would this spirit care
to make itself known?

01:15.748 --> 01:23.156
Jeanne?

01:31.697 --> 01:33.066
Where are you?

01:35.102 --> 01:37.004
I am within him,

01:37.037 --> 01:38.939
the Christ, on the cross.

01:41.841 --> 01:43.710
How is this happening?

01:49.248 --> 01:51.885
Stigmata is given at times
when your suffering world needs

01:51.918 --> 01:53.620
faith.

02:13.840 --> 02:17.545
And I am counting back
from five. When I reach one,

02:17.578 --> 02:26.854
you will be awake, refreshed.
Five, four, three, two, and one.

02:34.627 --> 02:35.795
Did we start yet?

03:09.862 --> 03:11.765
Chief.

03:16.135 --> 03:18.138
So, what can I do for you?

03:18.170 --> 03:20.673
As you know, we live in a dry
community by ordinance

03:20.706 --> 03:22.342
of council.

03:22.376 --> 03:25.111
I've been running
this side business.

03:25.145 --> 03:26.981
Buying beer and booze
in Brandon, but I thought

03:27.014 --> 03:29.884
why not go see Louis, keep
the shoonias closer to home?

03:31.852 --> 03:33.987
Okay.

03:34.020 --> 03:35.789
What kind of volume
are we talking about?

03:44.764 --> 03:46.633
Whoa.

03:46.667 --> 03:48.701
This is illegal, you know.

03:48.735 --> 03:52.339
Supply and demand is
at an all-time high.

03:52.372 --> 03:56.410
I pay biweekly, when
the welfare cheques come in.

03:56.443 --> 03:59.980
All that I ask is that
you give me a fair deal.

04:00.013 --> 04:03.016
Don't run low and we can both
make some cash, with minimal

04:03.050 --> 04:05.319
effort.

04:08.187 --> 04:10.189
So, are we good here?
I gotta get going.

04:10.223 --> 04:12.093
Blockade tomorrow.

04:14.227 --> 04:16.129
Okay. Deal.

04:17.963 --> 04:20.166
So, do I get
my peace offering?

04:20.199 --> 04:22.336
What do you mean?

04:22.369 --> 04:24.104
You're half-breed, right?

04:24.137 --> 04:26.040
Yeah?

04:26.072 --> 04:28.207
Then you know, you need
to offer me a gift to finish

04:28.240 --> 04:29.976
this transaction.

04:34.447 --> 04:36.149
Alright

06:08.175 --> 06:10.877
Hey! Good morning Charlie.

06:10.911 --> 06:12.913
- Thank you!
- Thanks, have a good one.

07:21.146 --> 07:22.882
Madame?

07:40.300 --> 07:42.903
This is Danielle Seraphin,
there's an injured old woman

07:42.935 --> 07:46.840
just south of Dead Man's Corner!
I need an ambulance, now!

08:08.495 --> 08:10.430
Don't worry.

08:17.437 --> 08:19.406
Jesus.

08:19.439 --> 08:21.208
No, no, no, I need you
to stay with me.

08:24.144 --> 08:25.946
Okay? Just stay with me.

08:31.016 --> 08:33.153
Oh God.

08:33.186 --> 08:35.256
Move, move!

08:36.188 --> 08:37.155
Jeanne is okay, my son?

08:39.125 --> 08:40.961
- Oh my god. What happened?
- I don't know.

08:40.994 --> 08:42.929
Jeanne! Jeanne!

08:46.198 --> 08:48.567
She's been marked with the hand
of Our Almighty Father!

08:48.600 --> 08:50.303
Could it be?

08:50.336 --> 08:52.972
We have witnessed a miracle.

09:01.081 --> 09:02.449
She's gone.

09:02.481 --> 09:04.583
Mrs. Seraphin,
you have to come.

09:04.616 --> 09:06.652
- What?
- Your daughter is in the back.

09:06.686 --> 09:08.288
Jeanne?

09:08.321 --> 09:09.990
We have to get her
to a hospital now, come.

09:10.023 --> 09:11.291
There is nothing we can do.
We still have a chance

09:11.323 --> 09:13.126
to save Jeanne.

09:19.164 --> 09:20.533
There's still too much blood
soaking through these dressings.

09:20.567 --> 09:22.302
My god, what happened!?

09:22.335 --> 09:24.071
She can't lose any more blood.
Has she taken any drug?

09:24.104 --> 09:25.605
How the hell do I know?

09:25.638 --> 09:27.708
BP monitor's reading sixty.
She's losing her pulse.

09:27.740 --> 09:29.976
Start CPR now! We need blood
volume to the heart.

09:30.009 --> 09:32.479
I'm on it.

09:32.511 --> 09:34.113
We've lost consciousness.
She's lethargic.

09:34.147 --> 09:35.449
- What does that mean?
- Not enough oxygen

09:35.481 --> 09:37.683
to the brain. There's no pulse.

09:37.716 --> 09:39.418
She's still bleeding.

09:39.451 --> 09:41.620
I know this is difficult but
you have to remain calm.

09:41.653 --> 09:45.692
How can I be fucking calm?
Look at her! Do something!

10:13.787 --> 10:15.389
Why is she still bleeding?

10:15.422 --> 10:18.225
Jeanne encountered
severe blood loss.

10:18.258 --> 10:21.161
The lacerations
hit major arteries.

10:21.193 --> 10:24.264
We can't tell yet whether or
not they were self-inflicted.

10:24.297 --> 10:28.235
Blasphemy. My daughter would
never do that.

10:28.268 --> 10:29.668
Are you sure?

10:29.701 --> 10:31.370
How well do you know
Jeanne these days?

10:31.403 --> 10:33.673
- What the fuck do you mean!
- Hey...

10:33.706 --> 10:35.776
There was pulseless electrical
activity in her heart

10:35.808 --> 10:38.444
when she traced. Combined
with the overdose...

10:38.477 --> 10:40.079
Overdose?

10:40.113 --> 10:43.116
We ran a tox screen and
found abnormal levels

10:43.149 --> 10:46.552
of acetaminophen, codeine,
marijuana, and traces

10:46.586 --> 10:48.422
of cocaine.

10:48.455 --> 10:50.424
Bullshit.

10:50.456 --> 10:53.826
We administered NarCan, a
reversal agent, as well

10:53.860 --> 10:56.495
as a coagulant
for the blood loss.

10:56.528 --> 11:00.634
Is Jeanne
gonna be okay?

11:00.667 --> 11:03.836
There may be residual
brain damage.

11:03.870 --> 11:07.740
Are you saying she's
gonna be a vegetable?

11:07.774 --> 11:09.775
Or a retard?

11:09.808 --> 11:13.279
We won't know anything until
we do a CAT scan.

11:13.312 --> 11:17.583
But what you should know is
that very few people recover

11:17.616 --> 11:20.053
after being away for so long.

11:21.488 --> 11:22.722
I'm sorry?

11:22.754 --> 11:25.759
Jeanne was dead
for twelve minutes.

11:42.241 --> 11:43.709
Father Luc?!

12:15.642 --> 12:18.177
I haven't had much use for God.

12:18.211 --> 12:19.546
How can you say that?

12:28.254 --> 12:31.925
What does it matter if we're
good or bad, live in virtue

12:31.957 --> 12:36.929
or sin? There is no joy left.

12:36.962 --> 12:41.334
We wither on the vine,
waiting to die.

13:01.421 --> 13:04.858
So why do you think
this is happening?

13:06.525 --> 13:08.728
If not to bring him
back into your heart.

13:41.326 --> 13:43.931
Your daughter is
a blessing to our community.

14:00.980 --> 14:03.783
Wow.

15:33.004 --> 15:35.442
Looking good, babe.

15:35.475 --> 15:38.878
Yeah, these petunias are still
blooming. I haven't had

15:38.910 --> 15:40.946
any frost yet.

15:49.154 --> 15:52.625
No, why don't we go in?

15:54.894 --> 15:56.629
Come on.

16:26.658 --> 16:28.595
You know what?

16:28.628 --> 16:30.562
Everybody thinks you're
having an affair.

16:30.596 --> 16:33.799
- Really?
- Hmm-hmm.

16:33.832 --> 16:35.901
Wow...

16:35.934 --> 16:37.937
So you're not?

16:39.138 --> 16:40.940
We haven't slept
together in a dog's age.

16:40.972 --> 16:43.509
You've never satisfied me.

16:43.543 --> 16:45.544
Bullshit. You love it.

16:45.577 --> 16:48.014
I fake it.

16:48.047 --> 16:50.048
You're soft Louis.

16:50.081 --> 16:52.119
Always too soft.

16:53.852 --> 16:56.055
Fucking liar.

17:14.673 --> 17:16.209
Shut the fuck up!

17:22.682 --> 17:24.150
What have you done!

17:24.182 --> 17:26.519
What have you done!

17:28.086 --> 17:30.824
Why do you care? The way I see
it I solved the problem.

17:30.856 --> 17:33.626
No more barking,
no more dog shit.

17:34.993 --> 17:36.862
What are you doing?

17:38.730 --> 17:40.133
Ça va me faire something to do.

17:40.165 --> 17:42.168
Don't
touch him!

17:45.003 --> 17:48.641
Alright. Have fun with your dog.

17:52.144 --> 17:54.448
Oh, God...

18:26.244 --> 18:28.213
..explained everything. If at
any point you want to withdraw

18:28.247 --> 18:31.150
your consent you are
perfectly welcome to do so.

18:31.182 --> 18:36.288
I believe this would
be the best for Jeanne.

18:36.321 --> 18:39.024
She shouldn't leave yet anyway.
We should monitor her some more.

18:43.061 --> 18:44.897
May I ask
what you are doing here?

18:44.931 --> 18:47.767
Are you her father?

18:47.799 --> 18:49.601
Yeah, I am.

18:49.634 --> 18:53.972
Then we come to offer
you sacred gifts.

18:54.006 --> 18:58.778
But first, we'd like to smoke
the Chanupah, so that we can

18:58.810 --> 19:01.980
appeased the spirits
with tobacco.

19:02.013 --> 19:04.216
- Are you fucking serious?
- Louis...

19:04.250 --> 19:09.055
But your ancestors...
Are you not Métis?

19:09.087 --> 19:12.057
- Hmm-hmm.
- Then you are one of us.

19:12.090 --> 19:14.826
Jesus Christ is my saviour.

19:14.859 --> 19:16.895
Not some pagan demon.

19:16.929 --> 19:19.666
They all come
from the same place.

19:19.699 --> 19:22.602
- Do not blaspheme my God.
- Louis, please.

19:24.103 --> 19:27.774
We are not Indians.
We're Catholic!

19:27.807 --> 19:31.810
We're not here to argue.
But we are here to appease

19:31.844 --> 19:34.581
the spirit of this man's
daughter.

19:34.614 --> 19:37.750
Well, Christ alone is
within her.

19:37.782 --> 19:41.954
Wakan Tanka is within her.

19:41.988 --> 19:43.789
Where's the harm in giving
them what they want?

19:43.823 --> 19:45.792
They're a Corruption
of Divine Providence!

19:45.825 --> 19:47.894
We would appreciate
an audience.

19:47.926 --> 19:51.597
Access is only given
if you can pay the price.

19:51.631 --> 19:55.602
And let me assure you,
it's high, very high.

19:55.634 --> 19:58.837
And that is why
we offer you sacred gifts.

19:58.871 --> 20:03.376
I'm talking about cash.
This, these trinkets mean

20:03.409 --> 20:05.211
nothing to me.

20:33.939 --> 20:35.709
Mom, you have to come.

20:40.046 --> 20:43.016
And don't forget: your financial
support helps us spread

20:43.048 --> 20:46.885
the Good Word of Jesus Christ.

Nah, I'm Okay.

21:58.990 --> 22:02.360
All righty then.

22:02.394 --> 22:07.232
Well, the reason we're all here
is that blessed little dove

22:07.266 --> 22:09.302
of yours.

22:09.335 --> 22:13.005
Have a seat, make
yourself at home.

22:13.038 --> 22:17.143
See, she's extremely
valuable to us.

22:17.175 --> 22:19.211
Extremely valuable.

22:19.244 --> 22:23.849
Now, let me get
down to brass tacks.

22:23.883 --> 22:26.818
We want exclusive access
to introduce your daughter

22:26.852 --> 22:29.155
to our congregation.

22:29.188 --> 22:33.993
Okay... And what do you think is
fair for such a privilege?

22:34.026 --> 22:37.096
Well, we've given that a lot
of thought and we came up

22:37.128 --> 22:42.234
with forty... hell, pardon my
French, we wanna make it an even

22:42.268 --> 22:46.439
fifty thousand, for exclusivity
and a one-on-one interview

22:46.471 --> 22:50.442
with yours truly, Peter Wolf.

22:50.476 --> 22:54.280
You broadcast
to millions, right?

22:54.313 --> 22:55.948
That's right

22:55.980 --> 22:58.785
You stand to profit quite
handsomely by my math.

22:58.817 --> 23:02.489
Surely you can do better
than fifty thousand, no?

23:06.057 --> 23:09.528
Well, what exactly did
you have in mind?

23:09.561 --> 23:15.500
Well, I am a simple man and I'm
not used to such negotiations,

23:15.534 --> 23:18.504
- but um...
- But?

23:18.537 --> 23:24.844
But I would say my family needs
to see a more substantial offer.

23:24.876 --> 23:29.348
- Alright.
- Let's say six figures?

23:33.885 --> 23:39.192
Ha... tsssss...

23:39.224 --> 23:40.326
Can you believe this man,
with all things...

23:40.358 --> 23:42.261
He needs six figures out of me.

23:45.497 --> 23:48.467
Father Antoine told me
the Vatican is already

23:48.500 --> 23:54.272
on its way. Would you like some
more time to think it over?

23:54.306 --> 23:56.976
Okay! Okay! You win.

23:57.009 --> 23:59.478
But only because I am
a generous man with the Lord

23:59.510 --> 24:02.280
as my Shepherd.
Write the man a check.

24:02.314 --> 24:04.617
I hope your daughter's
the real deal.

24:04.650 --> 24:08.288
Don't worry, she's
worth every penny.

24:16.996 --> 24:18.598
Well, you're always on my case
about not grabbing the bull

24:18.631 --> 24:21.968
by the horns, so I'm saying,
saddle up baby, we got

24:22.000 --> 24:25.104
ourselves a first-class
ticket to the good life!

24:25.136 --> 24:28.206
She's not some hooker you can
pimp. She's your daughter.

24:28.240 --> 24:31.644
Who I love very much. Look,
they just want a taste.

24:31.676 --> 24:33.980
They're harmless. Trust me.

24:44.289 --> 24:47.125
She's going to be okay.

24:47.159 --> 24:49.328
She's going to be okay.

24:49.361 --> 24:51.664
The messenger,

24:51.696 --> 24:57.602
the messenger is here!

25:26.498 --> 25:29.501
Hi. Welcome back.

25:32.136 --> 25:35.140
- Where am I?
- With us, in the hospital.

25:35.173 --> 25:41.079
Hey, how you doing, sweetie?
Are you in any pain?

25:43.082 --> 25:47.987
No, I feel fine. Why am I here?

25:53.491 --> 25:55.994
God came to you,
as you slept, my daughter.

25:56.028 --> 26:02.201
And He marked you so,
the whole world would know.

26:02.233 --> 26:05.971
Would know what?

26:06.005 --> 26:12.411
That He has not
forgotten: us, his children.

26:12.443 --> 26:18.616
We, the Métis are the Chosen
Ones, the Lost Tribe.

26:18.650 --> 26:22.055
But now, we are found!

26:26.325 --> 26:29.128
How is the old woman?

26:29.161 --> 26:31.197
Huh?

26:31.230 --> 26:34.432
The one in the field.

26:34.465 --> 26:36.434
How could you know about her?

26:36.468 --> 26:41.539
Well, I saw her. I set her free.

26:41.573 --> 26:48.314
Yeah, she's free, she's free,
because of you, Jeanne.

26:48.346 --> 26:51.350
Because of you.

26:54.452 --> 26:56.654
Your body has been through
so much Ms. Seraphin.

26:56.688 --> 26:59.325
We need to keep you
for another day.

26:59.357 --> 27:00.725
With all this excitement
your family should probably

27:00.759 --> 27:03.028
rest up too.

27:33.724 --> 27:35.627
Un café?

27:35.661 --> 27:38.798
Love some. Ya got
Jamaican Blue Mountain?

27:38.830 --> 27:41.766
We've got regular and decaf.

27:41.799 --> 27:46.471
Alright, regular it is then.

27:46.505 --> 27:51.110
I'm Juniper Fairweather.

27:51.143 --> 27:55.314
Student of Osiris, Lord
of Love, God of the Afterlife.

27:55.346 --> 27:58.116
I'm not familiar with him.

27:58.150 --> 27:59.585
Old or new Testament?

27:59.617 --> 28:03.588
Oh... The Egyptian
Book of the Dead, my dear.

28:03.622 --> 28:06.459
It's a little older
than the Bible.

28:06.491 --> 28:10.628
Some say it's the basis
for the New Testament.

28:10.662 --> 28:14.467
I remember hearing
stories about you.

28:14.500 --> 28:17.135
You were quite the troublemaker.

28:17.169 --> 28:21.107
Kinda hard to fit in
with the tan, you know?

28:21.140 --> 28:23.142
The whole town picked on me.
I couldn't wait to get out

28:23.174 --> 28:24.809
of here.

28:24.843 --> 28:28.147
Yeah, I know what you mean.

28:28.180 --> 28:30.649
Wait, weren't you were a senior,
and you left to join

28:30.682 --> 28:32.884
a commune or something?

28:32.917 --> 28:35.620
It was a cult.

28:35.653 --> 28:38.891
If I remember correctly you
haven't been back since.

28:38.923 --> 28:42.461
Well, I'm a wandering spirit
with a restless heart.

28:42.493 --> 28:49.901
I've seen the world: India,
Nepal, Argentina, Egypt.

28:49.934 --> 28:55.540
And finally, with the guidance
of some Peruvian brujos

28:55.574 --> 29:00.113
I was able to harness
my psychic abilities.

29:03.347 --> 29:05.518
Well, it's
quite the coincidence

29:05.550 --> 29:09.654
in timing you being here,
with my daughter, and all.

29:44.722 --> 29:48.426
<i>Toute</i> the notoriety
and the excitement...

29:57.336 --> 30:00.506
<i>Euh, non.</i> I mean financially.

30:02.007 --> 30:05.644
Your coffers are getting
big from all of this, no?

30:05.676 --> 30:09.814
I've heard of donations coming
in from as far away as Brazil.

30:09.847 --> 30:12.652
And, what's this?

30:19.857 --> 30:26.865
So, I don't know. Should
my family not also reap

30:26.897 --> 30:29.634
the rewards?

30:29.667 --> 30:32.937
Once the world sees whom to make
the cheques out to in the name

30:32.971 --> 30:39.845
of the Lord, there will be
a lot of it. I'm a conflicted

30:39.877 --> 30:47.352
man, should I split the proceeds
with you, or provide exclusive

30:47.385 --> 30:51.490
access to our televangelical
friend from America?

30:51.522 --> 30:54.326
Of course, I would prefer
to join hands with the Catholic

30:54.358 --> 30:58.763
Church of Canada, but Mr. Wolf
has promised us a big piece

30:58.797 --> 31:01.567
of the pie.

31:05.936 --> 31:08.006
We don't have
that kind of money.

31:08.039 --> 31:10.509
Come on.

31:10.541 --> 31:14.045
I read the papers you know.
You have millions set aside

31:14.078 --> 31:17.950
for the Residential School
cases. So, I don't know,

31:17.982 --> 31:22.587
you could pay me
using the interest.

31:23.954 --> 31:29.928
I run a church,
not a bank, Louis.

31:32.698 --> 31:39.405
Look, I am a modest
man with a modest request.

31:39.438 --> 31:43.676
I will hold this cheque
for a few hours out of respect.

31:43.709 --> 31:48.480
It will give you some time
to reconsider your position.

31:51.950 --> 31:53.885
It is a slippery slope
upon which you tread,

31:53.919 --> 31:55.821
Monsieur Seraphin.

31:55.854 --> 31:57.423
Well...

32:02.728 --> 32:07.833
Monsieur Seraphin, I would
ask that you to choose

32:07.865 --> 32:09.500
- with your heart.
- Look, I wish it was

32:09.534 --> 32:12.471
different, but I cash
this cheque, and we're

32:12.503 --> 32:16.474
finally financially
independent. So, if I were you,

32:16.508 --> 32:20.879
in your position, I'd
ask myself one thing,

32:20.912 --> 32:24.883
Can I afford NOT to?

32:24.915 --> 32:32.892
And remember Luc, all
of this is a godsend.

33:28.547 --> 33:30.915
...the priestess of a new
church, a new order.

33:30.949 --> 33:32.451
You have my word.

33:32.483 --> 33:37.990
Hey, you're sleeping? Hey!

33:42.560 --> 33:45.663
Jeanne! Jeanne?

33:45.696 --> 33:47.699
My god. Jeanne?

33:49.034 --> 33:51.203
- What happened?
- She's gone!

34:05.983 --> 34:07.819
At
least 50 police officers are

34:07.853 --> 34:09.554
- searching right now.
- We don't have a person

34:09.588 --> 34:12.724
of interest, and we're going
to look at every angle.

34:12.757 --> 34:14.960
...what happened to a 16 year

34:14.992 --> 34:17.695
old girl that has vanished...

34:24.001 --> 34:25.971
That's right David, indeed

34:26.003 --> 34:29.806
- they are. She was last seen...
- And this morning, her family

34:29.840 --> 34:31.710
and police are desperate
to find her...

34:31.742 --> 34:33.110
A mother is desperate to find

34:33.143 --> 34:34.911
her teenage daughter
who has been missing...

34:34.945 --> 34:37.547
The headline this evening,

34:37.581 --> 34:39.585
authorities a short time ago...

34:41.219 --> 34:42.920
...the girl, nowhere to be

34:42.954 --> 34:46.592
found, issued a nationwide
Amber Alert on Monday.

34:46.625 --> 34:49.994
Authorities now flooded
with over 200 tips...

34:50.027 --> 34:54.065
A community close together,
praying for her safe return...

36:01.599 --> 36:05.270
And with his
stripes, we are healed.

36:24.121 --> 36:25.957
The small
French Catholic town

36:25.990 --> 36:28.726
of St. Michel is in shock as
16-year-old Jeanne Seraphin,

36:28.760 --> 36:32.097
considered to be stigmatic, has
been kidnapped from the hospital

36:32.130 --> 36:36.068
near Notre Dame. Several reports
confirm that the young Métis

36:36.101 --> 36:39.204
bore the torturous marks of
Christ during crucifixion.

36:58.222 --> 37:00.391
Ah...

37:00.425 --> 37:01.793
Oh, thank God!

37:01.826 --> 37:04.396
Ah! Thank God!

37:35.393 --> 37:42.034
Most high, omnipotent, good
Lord. Praise, glory and honour

37:42.067 --> 37:45.771
and benediction all, are thine.

37:45.804 --> 37:47.840
Will you hear my confession?

37:50.074 --> 37:52.743
I'm not your sister.

37:52.777 --> 37:55.981
You are a disgusting
pig. Let me go!!

37:57.481 --> 38:03.188
I am... wretched.

38:03.221 --> 38:06.791
I have lived for a thousand
years in this leathery skin

38:06.824 --> 38:14.331
suit. Why must you punish me so?

38:14.364 --> 38:19.737
End it now. I am begging.

38:19.771 --> 38:22.774
You want to die?

38:22.806 --> 38:27.478
I have sinned,
oh how I have sinned!

38:27.512 --> 38:32.017
But what would you expect of me?

38:32.050 --> 38:38.423
Oh Creator, you said you would
give me direction, inspiration,

38:38.456 --> 38:41.860
and my only elucidation is that
humanity, no matter how wretched

38:41.893 --> 38:46.231
or virtuous, rots.

39:51.094 --> 39:53.197
Hey.

40:22.960 --> 40:29.834
You are The Burning One.

40:29.867 --> 40:32.036
The wounds of Christ.
I know them well.

40:47.518 --> 40:53.057
I cannot die,
but I welcome death!

41:08.405 --> 41:10.074
What are you doing?

41:10.108 --> 41:13.111
I'm preparing
you for your final test.

41:45.576 --> 41:47.478
Uh-oh. Negative
energy all around.

41:47.512 --> 41:51.048
First things first.
Let me smudge you.

42:00.291 --> 42:02.093
Thank you.

42:02.126 --> 42:05.263
June, I'm sorry to show up
like this, but I didn't know

42:05.295 --> 42:07.698
where else to go.

42:07.731 --> 42:10.402
What's your crisis?

42:10.434 --> 42:13.203
I need you to help me
find my daughter.

42:13.237 --> 42:15.139
With your gift. I can pay you.

42:15.172 --> 42:17.041
Whatever you want.

42:17.074 --> 42:20.511
Oh, your money's no good here.
Let's go see what we can do.

42:45.036 --> 42:50.108
Hello! Hello?

43:01.184 --> 43:03.755
So many have I tried
to pass on the gift.

43:03.788 --> 43:06.157
But none survived.

43:06.190 --> 43:09.427
You are the one.

43:12.797 --> 43:15.300
A mere servant.

43:15.333 --> 43:17.568
But my heart is ready.

43:28.780 --> 43:31.149
What do you want from me?

43:33.317 --> 43:37.556
Freedom.

43:42.293 --> 43:46.463
He, my most holy of Fathers,
is ready to receive.

43:51.702 --> 43:58.243
When I leave, I travel like
electricity through power lines.

43:58.275 --> 43:59.510
What did you see?

44:00.777 --> 44:04.281
Ancient graves.

44:04.315 --> 44:07.751
A strange creature.

44:07.784 --> 44:11.623
She's near the stone
church under the earth.

44:27.605 --> 44:29.706
There is nothing out there.

44:29.739 --> 44:31.675
Faith, dear.

44:44.222 --> 44:45.791
There. To the right.

45:13.751 --> 45:15.687
Jeanne?

45:19.157 --> 45:21.159
Jeanne!

45:26.496 --> 45:29.233
Jeanne?

45:29.266 --> 45:31.202
Danielle!

45:35.907 --> 45:37.709
Here.

45:43.547 --> 45:47.251
Ah... Ah... Ha...

45:52.222 --> 45:54.791
Ah!

45:54.824 --> 45:58.829
Ah!

46:22.320 --> 46:26.224
Jeanne?

46:27.592 --> 46:29.728
Jeanne!

48:04.387 --> 48:05.789
I wanted to wait on the blood
work to come back from Winnipeg

48:05.822 --> 48:08.792
so I could give you
an accurate diagnosis.

48:08.826 --> 48:10.827
For what?

48:10.860 --> 48:13.397
To prove our Jeanne
is stigmatic?

48:13.431 --> 48:15.932
Wouldn't that be beautiful?

48:15.965 --> 48:17.801
Certainly.

48:17.835 --> 48:19.570
In addition to Jeanne's
bleeding, we discovered

48:19.603 --> 48:22.840
an enlarged spleen,
lymph nodes, and liver.

48:22.873 --> 48:24.876
What's your point?

48:24.909 --> 48:28.713
<i>Monsieur
et Madame</i> Seraphin,

48:28.746 --> 48:31.682
Jeanne has chronic
myelogenous leukemia.

48:36.353 --> 48:38.722
Cancer?

48:38.755 --> 48:40.625
The drugs Jeanne took
sufficiently weakened

48:40.657 --> 48:43.827
her system. Combined with the
trauma from the kidnapping,

48:43.860 --> 48:47.097
this likely helped
the cancer take hold.

48:47.130 --> 48:48.833
Are
you saying...

48:48.865 --> 48:52.769
Are you saying... are you
saying she's going to die?

48:52.802 --> 48:57.442
Unfortunately this form of
cancer doesn't discriminate.

48:57.474 --> 49:01.846
With Jeanne, it could be
a few months to several years.

49:01.878 --> 49:07.018
But, we're still no closer
to understanding what caused

49:07.050 --> 49:11.956
the injuries. She has not
admitted to any self-immolation.

49:11.989 --> 49:15.393
The original wounds healed
remarkably with no scarring,

49:15.425 --> 49:18.462
yet she continues to bleed.
There's no medical reason

49:18.496 --> 49:21.099
for her to do so, cancer or not.

49:21.132 --> 49:23.400
Because it's God's will.

49:23.434 --> 49:27.638
Perhaps, and I respect
your personal religious views.

49:27.670 --> 49:31.475
However, I took the liberty
of calling a colleague of mine

49:31.509 --> 49:34.945
from Winnipeg. She's an expert
on psychological disorders.

49:34.978 --> 49:37.948
As your daughter's case is quite
exceptional, I didn't want

49:37.981 --> 49:39.483
to rule anything out.

49:39.516 --> 49:41.118
Such as?

49:41.152 --> 49:44.088
I'd like Dr. Sloan
to examine her.

49:44.121 --> 49:48.059
How long will it take?
People are waiting.

49:48.092 --> 49:50.628
With everything she's been
through, I'd like to determine

49:50.661 --> 49:53.931
whether or not her physiology is
reacting to some psychosomatic

49:53.963 --> 49:56.000
response.

49:56.032 --> 49:58.502
Are you saying
she made all this up?

49:58.536 --> 50:01.905
Let me put it this way:
if Jeanne is as you claim,

50:01.938 --> 50:03.907
I will discharge her
immediately, provided you agree

50:03.940 --> 50:06.910
to weekly appointments
to monitor her.

50:06.943 --> 50:09.079
How does that sound?

51:00.697 --> 51:03.000
Some stigmatics over
the centuries marked themselves

51:03.032 --> 51:06.804
in an effort to suffer
with Christ as a form of piety.

51:06.836 --> 51:10.608
Do you know what that means?

51:10.641 --> 51:12.844
Devotion, yes.

51:12.876 --> 51:15.846
Well, some believed
so intensely in his suffering,

51:15.880 --> 51:17.648
they made themselves bleed.

51:19.215 --> 51:21.920
Nobody would willingly put
themselves through what I have.

51:24.521 --> 51:29.125
If you believed it could help
your family or your community,

51:29.159 --> 51:34.265
would you be willing
to sacrifice your body?

51:34.297 --> 51:36.133
I guess.

51:37.934 --> 51:39.603
Would you say you're under
a particularly significant

51:39.637 --> 51:41.972
amount of stress?

51:42.005 --> 51:45.076
No more than anybody
else in town.

51:48.579 --> 51:50.014
Do you ever hear
voices in your head?

51:50.047 --> 51:54.684
End it now. End it now...

51:54.717 --> 51:56.953
Sometimes.

51:56.987 --> 52:00.023
Like who?

52:00.056 --> 52:02.626
Differing voices.

52:02.659 --> 52:05.028
What do they say?

52:05.061 --> 52:08.031
That my time is coming.

52:08.065 --> 52:12.936
Do you believe you are
destined for something greater?

52:18.675 --> 52:20.545
I hope so.

52:26.650 --> 52:28.219
Would you consider yourself
to be a particularly devout

52:28.251 --> 52:30.054
Catholic?

52:30.086 --> 52:33.324
Nobody in this town is.

52:33.356 --> 52:36.259
If you pay attention, you see
the whole town is sinning.

52:36.293 --> 52:38.663
How so?

52:38.695 --> 52:41.665
We're supposed to live
by; thou shalt not do this

52:41.699 --> 52:45.336
or do that. But everybody does.
You go to church, you wear

52:45.369 --> 52:47.872
the cross,
but it doesn't mean anything.

52:47.905 --> 52:50.742
Even you?

53:00.083 --> 53:01.985
I'm not perfect.

53:09.793 --> 53:11.863
So, are we good?

53:13.396 --> 53:15.065
Your daughter has been
through quite an ordeal.

53:15.099 --> 53:18.102
It's no secret this is
a unique case. And there is

53:18.135 --> 53:20.071
one more thing
I'd like to explore.

53:20.103 --> 53:23.340
What?

53:23.373 --> 53:26.176
Jeanne indicated hearing
voices in her head.

53:26.210 --> 53:29.380
She may be experiencing
multiple personalities and one

53:29.413 --> 53:32.248
of them might have marked her.

53:32.282 --> 53:34.885
What like schizophrenia?

53:34.918 --> 53:37.320
I'm not convinced to that.

53:37.353 --> 53:39.056
There is so much we don't know
about stigmata from both

53:39.088 --> 53:42.226
a mental and physiological
point of view.

53:42.259 --> 53:46.097
With your permission,
I'd like to try hypnosis.

53:46.130 --> 53:50.201
If it's in her head,
we will know.

53:50.233 --> 53:52.670
And if it's not?

53:52.702 --> 53:54.005
Then you will have my expert
opinion that she's neither

53:54.038 --> 53:57.175
delusional nor fabricating this.

54:11.320 --> 54:24.434
And I am counting down from
five, four, three, two and one.

54:24.467 --> 54:28.038
You are now asleep.

54:28.072 --> 54:30.007
Can you hear me?

54:30.039 --> 54:32.110
Yes.

54:34.210 --> 54:38.081
Will you hear my confession?

54:38.114 --> 54:40.717
Of course.

54:40.751 --> 54:44.689
End it now! I beg.

54:44.722 --> 54:48.793
You want to die?

54:48.826 --> 54:53.063
Yes.

54:53.097 --> 54:56.133
Would this spirit care
to make itself known?

54:59.235 --> 55:04.074
Oh how I have sinned! But what
would you expect of me?

55:04.108 --> 55:06.077
Jeanne?

55:08.445 --> 55:12.016
Oh Creator.

55:12.048 --> 55:16.487
You are the Burning One.

55:16.519 --> 55:19.222
The wounds of Christ.

55:22.860 --> 55:24.361
Where are you?

55:26.028 --> 55:30.768
I am within him,
the Christ, on the cross.

55:34.403 --> 55:36.440
How is this happening?

55:37.907 --> 55:42.313
I am... wretched.

55:47.351 --> 55:49.119
Who are you?

55:52.922 --> 55:54.858
Becoming.

55:56.527 --> 55:58.963
Stigmata is given at times when
your suffering world needs

55:58.996 --> 56:00.865
faith.

56:20.416 --> 56:24.020
And I am counting
back from five.

56:24.054 --> 56:27.557
When I reach one,
you will be awake, refreshed.

56:27.590 --> 56:30.560
I cannot die.

56:30.594 --> 56:33.563
- Five...
- But I welcome death.

56:33.597 --> 56:38.803
...four, three, two, and one.

56:43.940 --> 56:45.542
Did we start yet?

57:27.251 --> 57:29.386
What is all of this?

57:29.418 --> 57:32.088
It's all for you, Jeanne.

57:36.260 --> 57:38.528
Come, let's prepare you
for the press conference.

57:41.664 --> 57:43.634
Welcome home!

57:44.601 --> 57:46.304
Sorry, sorry.

57:49.273 --> 57:51.541
She's okay, she's okay.

57:51.574 --> 57:53.343
Jeanne, Jeanne come here.

57:53.376 --> 57:55.012
Come here.

57:55.045 --> 57:57.181
Don't touch her!
Don't touch her!

58:13.429 --> 58:15.565
Hi, I'm Condie.

58:15.599 --> 58:17.601
I'll be doing your make-up.

58:17.634 --> 58:19.269
It's such an honour to meet you.

58:19.302 --> 58:23.641
Ah, there she is,
our blessed Northern Star.

58:38.155 --> 58:42.059
Alright. So,
the bleeding has subsided?

58:43.994 --> 58:46.430
Not yet. I think they call
it a weeping wound.

58:46.463 --> 58:49.500
Fantastic.

58:49.532 --> 58:52.103
Fantastic.

58:53.570 --> 58:55.506
Are you ready
to be world-famous?

58:57.239 --> 58:59.676
Uh, I guess so.

58:59.710 --> 59:02.313
Great. Hey, just act natural.

59:02.346 --> 59:05.349
I'll do most of the talking, but
it will be important for you

59:05.382 --> 59:07.351
to share whatever is
in your heart.

59:11.121 --> 59:14.291
Can you do that for me?

59:14.324 --> 59:17.528
All right. We got twenty minutes
before we do the unveiling.

59:17.561 --> 59:23.600
Perhaps a wardrobe change?
Something more... devout?

59:23.632 --> 59:24.734
What did you have in mind?

59:24.768 --> 59:26.704
Hmm. That's a good question.

59:26.737 --> 59:29.572
Condie, I'll leave it up
to your fine judgment.

59:29.606 --> 59:31.208
Will see you in a bit.

59:31.240 --> 59:34.143
Great. Come with me, my dear.

59:34.177 --> 59:35.646
I have just the outfit for you.

59:35.679 --> 59:38.215
Excuse me.

59:38.248 --> 59:41.085
Can I talk to you for a minute?

59:41.117 --> 59:43.219
Of course.

59:43.253 --> 59:46.190
Who is he?

59:46.222 --> 59:48.058
Sit.

59:53.230 --> 59:58.434
That man just paid for your
university education, that new

59:58.467 --> 01:00:03.406
truck for your dad and maybe
a little something for you too.

01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:11.181
All you have to do is share your
experience, what you remember,

01:00:11.213 --> 01:00:17.653
if anything.
Did you see the light?

01:00:17.686 --> 01:00:21.357
If you feel like Jesus
is within you, say so.

01:00:21.391 --> 01:00:25.662
He's going to get that crowd
going crazy out there.

01:00:25.695 --> 01:00:29.432
You're going to be
like God, Jeanne.

01:00:29.465 --> 01:00:32.735
Everywhere.

01:00:32.768 --> 01:00:36.072
Think you can handle it?

01:00:36.106 --> 01:00:38.542
Sure.

01:00:38.574 --> 01:00:40.343
I guess.

01:00:47.217 --> 01:00:52.389
Now, go with that nice lady and
she'll get you ready, all right?

01:01:19.682 --> 01:01:22.119
I can't...

01:01:50.646 --> 01:01:54.684
We bring you a very special
episode of Inspirational TV.

01:01:54.717 --> 01:01:57.887
We're all the way up in
St. Michel Manitoba, Canada.

01:01:57.920 --> 01:02:00.690
Before me is our honoured guest.

01:02:00.724 --> 01:02:03.559
Jeanne Seraphin, which I should
remind our viewers across

01:02:03.592 --> 01:02:08.197
the Inspiration Nation
translated from French means

01:02:08.231 --> 01:02:13.303
Angel. Now, you woke up
in your bed covered in blood.

01:02:13.335 --> 01:02:18.474
Tell us, what that was like in
those first frantic moments?

01:02:18.507 --> 01:02:25.348
Well, I don't really recall
much, other than blinding pain.

01:02:25.382 --> 01:02:28.251
There was blood everywhere.
I thought that I was dreaming.

01:02:28.284 --> 01:02:31.420
Than the ambulance came. I was
in and out really quick,

01:02:31.454 --> 01:02:36.793
but the one thing absolutely
vivid in my memory was

01:02:36.826 --> 01:02:40.563
my holding my mom's hand,
and seeing the cross around

01:02:40.597 --> 01:02:45.669
her neck. It was
very comforting.

01:02:45.702 --> 01:02:48.272
That's excellent.

01:02:48.304 --> 01:02:50.806
And it was then that
you lost consciousness.

01:02:50.840 --> 01:02:54.244
In fact, doctors confirm
you were clinically dead

01:02:54.277 --> 01:02:58.882
for twelve magnificent,
breathtaking minutes.

01:02:58.914 --> 01:03:02.351
One for each blessed apostle.
Now, would you share with

01:03:02.385 --> 01:03:06.590
our congregation, what did
you see when you travelled

01:03:06.623 --> 01:03:08.525
to the other side?

01:03:14.998 --> 01:03:22.706
Oh it was beautiful, white,
like clouds, and warm.

01:03:28.478 --> 01:03:30.414
I remember being filled with
a joy I have never felt here

01:03:30.447 --> 01:03:32.516
on Earth.

01:03:35.918 --> 01:03:39.623
Did you feel our Almighty God?

01:03:39.655 --> 01:03:41.458
Yes.

01:03:41.490 --> 01:03:45.996
I felt His love, as if I was
wrapped in a warm blanket.

01:03:46.028 --> 01:03:49.300
Wow, ain't that something.

01:04:13.657 --> 01:04:14.925
Hey kiddo.

01:04:14.958 --> 01:04:17.628
How you doing?

01:04:17.661 --> 01:04:20.797
This whole saint business?

01:04:20.829 --> 01:04:23.266
Weird.

01:04:23.300 --> 01:04:24.702
Yeah, I bet.

01:04:28.405 --> 01:04:33.644
You know, when I was about
your age, I moved to New York.

01:04:33.677 --> 01:04:35.545
Piano.

01:04:35.577 --> 01:04:39.583
I remember the picture
of you in Times Square.

01:04:39.615 --> 01:04:42.686
I felt special.

01:04:42.719 --> 01:04:46.322
I was special.

01:04:46.356 --> 01:04:49.526
I was a prodigy.

01:04:49.559 --> 01:04:52.963
And then I gave it all up.

01:04:57.032 --> 01:05:00.737
I'm only telling you this
because I find it hard

01:05:00.769 --> 01:05:04.574
to believe I've had
a hand in making you.

01:05:04.606 --> 01:05:07.777
Isn't this God's will?

01:05:09.579 --> 01:05:14.851
I'm just one part
of it. People want proof.

01:05:14.884 --> 01:05:18.989
I don't know if they're ready...

01:05:19.021 --> 01:05:22.025
I don't know if
I can give it to them.

01:05:44.748 --> 01:05:47.583
Hello?

01:05:47.617 --> 01:05:49.119
Hi, is Charles there?

01:05:49.152 --> 01:05:51.554
No he isn't. Who is calling?

01:05:51.588 --> 01:05:55.125
Um, a friend from St. Michel.

01:05:55.157 --> 01:05:57.360
Well this is Charles' wife,
and you better not

01:05:57.393 --> 01:05:58.995
fucking call him back.

01:07:06.463 --> 01:07:09.132
You can't be here.

01:07:09.164 --> 01:07:11.000
It's not yet your time.

01:07:32.588 --> 01:07:37.027
Oh, this is a pleasant
surprise. Please, come sit.

01:07:43.266 --> 01:07:46.235
Thank you.

01:07:46.268 --> 01:07:48.805
And thank you for finding me.

01:07:50.739 --> 01:07:54.577
I am afraid I have nothing
to offer your little friends

01:07:54.610 --> 01:07:57.146
other than a quiet yard.

01:07:57.179 --> 01:08:01.484
They've been hibernating
in the mud since I was born.

01:08:02.751 --> 01:08:05.489
They've been waiting
for you, Jeanne.

01:08:05.521 --> 01:08:08.123
They're drawn to you.

01:08:08.157 --> 01:08:10.994
As will the crowds.

01:08:11.027 --> 01:08:18.600
Thousands, millions, waiting
with bated breath to hear

01:08:18.635 --> 01:08:21.136
your words.

01:08:21.170 --> 01:08:24.875
I am not so sure.

01:08:24.908 --> 01:08:28.078
From when the stars were made
a billion years ago,

01:08:28.109 --> 01:08:33.015
many people have questioned
their duty. But we are meant

01:08:33.048 --> 01:08:40.657
to be here, now. It's faith.

01:08:40.689 --> 01:08:42.591
I am scared.

01:08:42.625 --> 01:08:48.698
Embrace the opportunity.
Your words might create

01:08:48.729 --> 01:08:56.907
anarchy, chaos. But we mustn't
ever be afraid to evolve,

01:08:56.939 --> 01:09:00.576
to learn. To love.

01:09:00.609 --> 01:09:02.813
She knows, she knows.

01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:08.250
What's the pipe for?

01:09:08.283 --> 01:09:12.587
Prayers.

01:09:12.622 --> 01:09:15.993
This is how we talk
to our God, Creator.

01:10:32.001 --> 01:10:36.206
This is medicine,
and it will help you.

01:10:47.783 --> 01:10:50.052
Thank you.

01:10:55.792 --> 01:11:05.301
Sinners, sinners. (Inaudible)

01:11:05.333 --> 01:11:07.403
There is a hotter hell
for those sinners who do not

01:11:07.436 --> 01:11:15.944
follow me. As a Charismatic,
I'm endowed with holy gifts

01:11:15.978 --> 01:11:19.916
that flow through
this humble vessel.

01:11:19.948 --> 01:11:23.318
And let me say, the personal
sacrifices that I've made

01:11:23.351 --> 01:11:27.122
to show you, true believers,
that I'm worthy

01:11:27.155 --> 01:11:34.898
of your donations,
of your desperation.

01:11:34.930 --> 01:11:42.838
No, that's too on the nose.
Of your prayers.

01:11:42.872 --> 01:11:46.842
Yeah. That's it.

01:11:46.876 --> 01:11:49.112
Praise the Lord Almighty.

01:11:49.145 --> 01:11:51.014
Yada yada yada.

01:11:51.046 --> 01:11:55.784
Forgive this speech Father,

01:11:55.818 --> 01:11:58.155
forgive this sinner.

01:12:14.203 --> 01:12:18.041
All right. Don't stress,
don't stress.

01:12:18.073 --> 01:12:20.409
Even Jesus was a
fisherman by the way.

01:12:20.443 --> 01:12:23.313
Okay. Are you planning
on a sermon?

01:12:26.783 --> 01:12:32.387
We are Métis, right? But,
as far back as I can remember,

01:12:32.421 --> 01:12:36.059
we could never be proud.

01:12:36.091 --> 01:12:38.293
My father was more
Dumont than Riel.

01:12:38.327 --> 01:12:41.030
And my mother was Cree.

01:12:41.063 --> 01:12:43.800
Last time she spoke it,
my dad put the bottom end

01:12:43.832 --> 01:12:46.902
of his rifle into her head.

01:12:46.935 --> 01:12:50.105
He was fucking drunk.

01:12:50.139 --> 01:12:52.175
But, they were
below us, right?

01:12:56.345 --> 01:13:01.284
To this day I don't like to tan
in case I get too dark,

01:13:01.317 --> 01:13:06.322
and people start looking
at me differently.

01:13:06.354 --> 01:13:08.357
Never forget that.

01:13:08.390 --> 01:13:11.327
Your sister might
bring us some respect.

01:13:27.009 --> 01:13:29.578
Good afternoon, St-Michel!

01:13:29.612 --> 01:13:31.914
You all look so beautiful.

01:13:31.948 --> 01:13:37.086
I'm Peter Wolf, and now,
the voice you've been waiting

01:13:37.118 --> 01:13:40.589
to hear, Jeanne Seraphin.

01:14:06.515 --> 01:14:08.484
I have been chosen to bring
a gift of knowledge

01:14:08.516 --> 01:14:12.054
and understanding.

01:14:12.087 --> 01:14:14.122
As I share this wisdom, I will
represent what is good

01:14:14.155 --> 01:14:17.327
and just in our people.

01:14:17.359 --> 01:14:21.597
I am not doing this
out of fame or greed.

01:14:21.631 --> 01:14:24.567
I will give with my whole
heart to the people.

01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:26.502
That is my promise.

01:14:26.534 --> 01:14:28.337
Let the humans be saved.

01:14:28.371 --> 01:14:31.007
Let them understand.
Our voice can reach the heavens

01:14:31.039 --> 01:14:35.110
if we unite as one.
Together we will sing,

01:14:35.144 --> 01:14:38.347
and Creator will hear us.

01:14:38.381 --> 01:14:46.155
But first, I have
to confess my sins.

01:14:46.188 --> 01:14:48.458
My heart is heavy.

01:14:55.463 --> 01:14:58.368
I had premarital sexual
relations with a married man

01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:01.604
years older than myself.

01:15:01.636 --> 01:15:08.543
I became pregnant by that union.
I was so ashamed I could not

01:15:08.577 --> 01:15:14.516
take it anymore. So I went to
the city and I had an abortion.

01:15:16.418 --> 01:15:20.323
I became horribly depressed,
and I decided that I should

01:15:20.355 --> 01:15:25.094
kill myself, so that I could
be free from the pain.

01:15:29.198 --> 01:15:33.270
I cut myself, over and over
and over again to end it.

01:15:36.471 --> 01:15:40.143
I made those marks
because... I wanted to die.

01:15:40.176 --> 01:15:43.313
There was no stigmata when
I was rushed to the hospital.

01:15:43.345 --> 01:15:48.016
I committed suicide
because I was weak.

01:15:48.050 --> 01:15:51.954
I was a fake.

01:15:51.988 --> 01:15:53.489
No, it cannot be true!

01:15:53.521 --> 01:15:57.393
Please, please, I beg
you for your forgiveness.

01:15:57.426 --> 01:16:01.197
Now, this young woman is under
attack from the Evil One,

01:16:01.229 --> 01:16:07.069
Himself! Now beware, my flock,
of the wolf in sheep's clothing.

01:16:07.103 --> 01:16:09.572
I have not yet revealed
my message from our Lord.

01:16:09.604 --> 01:16:11.340
Please, let me speak.

01:16:11.373 --> 01:16:14.010
Let her speak!
Praise our Almighty God!

01:16:19.481 --> 01:16:24.453
God has healed me.
He brought me back to life.

01:16:24.487 --> 01:16:28.291
I am honoured and humbled
to stand here before you.

01:16:28.323 --> 01:16:31.527
And while my initial wounds were
done by my own hand, God,

01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:34.297
our Creator, has transformed
me into a vessel.

01:17:11.466 --> 01:17:15.270
Men like him are dangerous
and must be stopped.

01:17:15.304 --> 01:17:18.673
We must unite
the races, our voices one.

01:17:18.707 --> 01:17:22.145
I cast thee out Satan!
In the name of our Lord Jesus

01:17:22.177 --> 01:17:27.783
Christ, depart and vanish
from this creature of God!

01:17:27.817 --> 01:17:30.153
I cast the demon out!

01:17:35.557 --> 01:17:38.226
She is possessed!
Her soul is black!

01:17:38.260 --> 01:17:40.663
The Devil himself is
hiding within her!

01:17:40.695 --> 01:17:41.663
Run!

01:17:43.431 --> 01:17:45.600
Please remain calm!
Calm down everybody!

01:17:45.634 --> 01:17:47.503
She is the real thing! Don't go!

01:18:15.864 --> 01:18:19.168
You created quite a stir.

01:18:21.770 --> 01:18:25.441
I could not carry out His will
if I held those secrets.

01:18:25.474 --> 01:18:27.277
They would have come out.

01:18:28.911 --> 01:18:31.213
Perhaps.

01:18:31.247 --> 01:18:36.686
Did you not realize
what was at stake?

01:18:40.189 --> 01:18:42.758
We have multiple witnesses who
saw you bleed through unbroken

01:18:42.791 --> 01:18:49.465
skin. And, the physician, not
only did she corroborate

01:18:49.497 --> 01:18:53.468
the events there, what
she smelled, The Odour

01:18:53.502 --> 01:18:58.641
of Sanctity. The automatic
writing, the speaking

01:18:58.673 --> 01:19:03.246
in tongues. It was
all there. I saw the film.

01:19:03.279 --> 01:19:05.515
Then why did
they turn on me?

01:19:05.547 --> 01:19:11.253
They wanted desperately
to believe, but they cannot

01:19:11.287 --> 01:19:18.694
forgive. You win their hearts
and their minds with hope.

01:19:18.726 --> 01:19:24.533
You give them a sense
of purpose in their lives

01:19:24.567 --> 01:19:27.237
I wish I had died.

01:19:28.970 --> 01:19:32.641
God determines when
your time on Earth is done.

01:19:35.511 --> 01:19:37.247
But...

01:19:43.851 --> 01:19:51.528
...we are here now, and He has
more work for you to do.

01:20:22.658 --> 01:20:26.596
The Great Spirit works
in mysterious ways.

01:20:28.329 --> 01:20:33.001
If you were meant to
lead, you require a flock.

01:21:12.006 --> 01:21:13.909
How are you doing?

01:21:19.747 --> 01:21:24.720
I wasn't looking for anything,
but nobody believes me.

01:21:30.458 --> 01:21:36.064
You know, a few days ago,
I questioned if God meant

01:21:36.097 --> 01:21:39.034
anything any more.

01:21:39.068 --> 01:21:42.570
If faith even had
a place in our lives.

01:21:42.604 --> 01:21:44.940
And now?

01:21:44.972 --> 01:21:47.710
You've given me reason to hope.

01:21:49.011 --> 01:21:51.347
You know, believing
in something is better

01:21:51.380 --> 01:21:53.716
than nothing at all.

01:21:55.783 --> 01:22:00.555
Look at my girl: all grown up.

01:22:04.659 --> 01:22:06.496
You don't need me anymore.

01:22:36.891 --> 01:22:39.662
The eagle has landed.

01:22:44.466 --> 01:22:46.602
Good day to make some shoonias.

01:22:55.042 --> 01:22:57.846
I had to substitute the rye
with a different brand.

01:22:57.880 --> 01:23:00.882
Ended up being a buck
cheaper per bottle.

01:23:00.916 --> 01:23:03.619
That's all right. My people
don't care what they drink.

01:23:03.652 --> 01:23:06.855
All they care about is
forgetting their names.

01:23:09.725 --> 01:23:11.060
There you go.

01:23:11.092 --> 01:23:13.462
The last one.

01:23:16.698 --> 01:23:18.701
Just don't forget
to credit me the difference.

01:23:18.734 --> 01:23:20.703
Don't go thinking
I'll forget either.

01:23:25.073 --> 01:23:27.610
Can I ask you something?

01:23:29.744 --> 01:23:31.447
You really don't care about
selling booze to your people,

01:23:31.479 --> 01:23:36.518
do you? Profiting off
their extreme misery?

01:23:36.551 --> 01:23:37.952
You wearing a wire?

01:23:37.985 --> 01:23:40.655
Huh?

01:23:40.689 --> 01:23:43.092
What the fuck is
with this inquisition?

01:23:43.125 --> 01:23:45.795
We talked about this before,
and you didn't say shit.

01:23:45.828 --> 01:23:48.697
The way I look at it, you don't
have any right to talk

01:23:48.729 --> 01:23:50.732
about it now.

01:23:52.234 --> 01:23:54.503
Don't shit where
you eat, Frenchy.

01:23:54.536 --> 01:23:56.872
Take the money, have a good day.

01:23:56.904 --> 01:24:00.208
Do whatever the fuck you want
with it but just don't come

01:24:00.242 --> 01:24:02.011
preach to me about it, okay?

01:24:39.014 --> 01:24:42.551
Something's been digging
in my garden, eating most

01:24:42.583 --> 01:24:44.186
of the vegetables.

01:24:46.087 --> 01:24:50.725
Probably a rabbit. I'll take
care of it with one good shot.

01:24:50.759 --> 01:24:52.761
Without the drama of violence.

01:24:52.793 --> 01:24:55.130
Is that possible?

01:24:55.162 --> 01:24:57.632
Is poison too dramatic?

01:24:57.666 --> 01:25:00.135
In the garden. So, when I make
your lunch and I put lettuce

01:25:00.167 --> 01:25:03.005
and tomatoes grown in that soil,
you're okay with that?

01:25:03.037 --> 01:25:05.807
Fine. I'll set a snare.
Whatever you want.

01:25:16.918 --> 01:25:19.087
Have you spoken
to your daughter yet?

01:25:19.121 --> 01:25:20.890
Oh, so she's
my daughter now?

01:25:20.922 --> 01:25:24.193
Yeah, because she's
like you, a fucking liar.

01:25:35.069 --> 01:25:40.909
We spent so much money. Now,
it's all down the toilet.

01:25:40.943 --> 01:25:42.645
Well, it's a good thing
you cashed that cheque

01:25:42.677 --> 01:25:44.846
from Peter Wolf and used
his money instead of ours.

01:25:51.219 --> 01:25:52.688
How many of those
have you had already?

01:25:52.720 --> 01:25:56.190
Does it matter? Mmh?

01:25:56.224 --> 01:25:59.328
Of course, it does.
What's your fucking problem?

01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:02.297
Uh, I don't know. Maybe
that I'm married to a drunk.

01:26:02.331 --> 01:26:04.800
You know what, if you were
not such a fucking bitch,

01:26:04.832 --> 01:26:06.601
maybe I would drink less.

01:26:07.903 --> 01:26:09.637
Don't you dare blame me!

01:26:09.671 --> 01:26:10.706
Don't you dare or I will
scratch your fucking...

01:26:10.738 --> 01:26:13.107
You won't do shit, Louis.

01:26:13.140 --> 01:26:15.210
If anybody has the right
to drink over sorrows

01:26:15.243 --> 01:26:19.115
and regrets, it is my life
that was destroyed, not yours.

01:26:24.118 --> 01:26:26.921
I should have had an abortion
instead of rushing into

01:26:26.954 --> 01:26:29.958
this bullshit we call
a marriage. At least

01:26:29.992 --> 01:26:31.827
our daughter had
the fucking courage!

01:26:31.859 --> 01:26:35.830
Shut the fuck up! Now you're
talking about our children!

01:26:35.863 --> 01:26:37.599
Is nothing sacred
to you anymore?

01:26:37.632 --> 01:26:39.233
You fucking cunt.

01:26:39.266 --> 01:26:43.672
Do us a favour. Take a rope
and go find a strong tree.

01:26:46.140 --> 01:26:50.312
No, I would not give you
this satisfaction.

01:27:41.829 --> 01:27:45.967
This world, they do not

01:27:46.001 --> 01:27:50.072
deserve you. God, forgive them,
they know not what they do.

01:27:50.104 --> 01:27:56.377
They do not deserve you, mother.

01:28:48.229 --> 01:28:50.198
God, forgive them,
they know not what they do.

01:28:52.501 --> 01:28:54.970
They do not deserve you, mother.

01:30:43.645 --> 01:30:45.548
Jeanne?
