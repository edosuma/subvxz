I envisioned it

as being sort of this crusty,
beat-up hot rod truck,

a fresh, new frame.

it on his dime.

my cake and eating it too.

in the first place.

turn around and sell it.

Richard:
This is a great deal for me.

02:08.720 --> 02:10.660

by finding the '33,

02:10.660 --> 02:12.530
and pulling it out
of somebody's barn.

02:12.530 --> 02:15.200
Plus, he's already got a
solid plan for it in his head.

That's why he's here, to
bring his vision to the build.

02:18.470 --> 02:20.730
The fords that came out
in the early 1930s are what

that they could haul ass,

seeing the build come along,

02:40.920 --> 02:42.520
I'm thinking it might
be worth a lot of money,

02:51.270 --> 02:53.830
Yeah, the bed floor
is kinda trashed.

02:53.840 --> 02:55.800
Brian: Originally my idea
was to coat the bed

02:55.800 --> 02:57.340
with some kind of liner, just to

02:57.340 --> 02:59.010
protect cargo from
the rust and crap.

02:59.010 --> 03:00.470
But, I think it's
gonna be too cool

03:00.480 --> 03:02.440

hauler, or something

03:02.440 --> 03:04.210
you throw dirty old
parts in the back,

03:04.210 --> 03:06.950

because if it is

we all get to maybe

03:08.450 --> 03:09.450
drive it every once in a while.

But, if it's too
cool for that then

sold down the road

gotta use, we gotta do it.

20 or 22 in it.

39:47.010 --> 39:48.780
But most importantly, I
think I've got a buyer.

39:48.780 --> 39:50.620
My buddy, shawn, from
minnesota is here.

39:50.620 --> 39:52.720
Sorry brian bass,
but business calls.

39:52.720 --> 39:54.590
What's going on?
Not too much.

39:54.590 --> 39:55.790
It's rad, dude!

39:55.790 --> 39:57.860
I mean h&h flathead.

39:57.860 --> 39:59.320
Looks like
everything's brand new.

39:59.330 --> 40:01.730
My name is shawn nolan, I'm
from annandale, minnesota.

40:01.730 --> 40:04.160
For a hobby and stuff I
buy and sell old signs.

40:04.160 --> 40:06.500
Richard:
For some reason, I've gotten
into collecting vintage signs.

40:06.500 --> 40:08.430
And shawn's brought
me a cool one.

40:08.440 --> 40:10.000
You got the pictures?
Yeah.

40:10.000 --> 40:11.270
Oh, very cool.

40:11.270 --> 40:14.870
The sign is 25 feet tall,
it's absolutely insane

40:14.880 --> 40:16.540
its an old gas station sign.

40:16.540 --> 40:19.180
The last time it was turned on
was 1972

40:19.180 --> 40:23.450
and the gas price
was 23.9 cents a gallon.

40:23.450 --> 40:24.950
What do you want for this?

40:24.950 --> 40:26.520
5 grand.

40:26.520 --> 40:28.690
It's a beat up old sign.
[ laughs ]

40:28.690 --> 40:31.460
it's probably worth
up to $10,000 maybe.

40:31.460 --> 40:33.220
So how much you
want for the truck?

40:33.230 --> 40:35.490
Well, I want like 30
grand for the truck.

40:35.500 --> 40:37.660
So I know it's still
just an old '33 pick up

40:37.660 --> 40:38.960
but everything's new,

40:38.970 --> 40:40.800
everything's fresh,
killer interior.

40:40.800 --> 40:42.630
I'll take you for a ride.
Okay

40:42.640 --> 40:44.200
then we can talk numbers.
Okay.

40:44.200 --> 40:46.270
Richard: I totally dig
the sign, and to make

40:46.270 --> 40:48.210
sure shawn is just as
hooked on the truck,

40:48.210 --> 40:50.540
it's time for a little
test drive.

40:50.540 --> 40:57.450
♪

40:57.450 --> 40:58.880
heck yeah.

40:58.890 --> 41:05.520
♪

41:05.530 --> 41:06.860
so I took him for a
test drive in the truck

41:06.860 --> 41:08.960
before and flawlessly
he's really into it.

41:08.960 --> 41:10.430
We just gotta make a deal,
there's gotta be

41:10.430 --> 41:12.830
some middle ground there.
He's at 5 grand on the sign,

41:12.830 --> 41:14.800
and I'm at 30 grand
on the truck.

41:14.800 --> 41:15.830
I don't know, you
tell me, what do you

41:15.840 --> 41:16.940
think the truck's worth?

41:16.940 --> 41:20.240
20 grand and the sign?
No way, man.

41:20.240 --> 41:21.810
We just gotta make a deal,
there's gotta

41:21.810 --> 41:23.010
be some middle ground there.

41:23.010 --> 41:25.840
I just wanted to at
least be 25 and the sign.

41:25.850 --> 41:28.150
How about 25 and the sign?

41:28.150 --> 41:30.050
22.
25 and the sign,

41:30.050 --> 41:31.650
that's my offer.
Okay.

41:31.650 --> 41:33.250
Is that a deal?
Yeah.

41:33.250 --> 41:34.990
Alright, man.

41:34.990 --> 41:37.320
Let's go do some paper work
and we'll find some of my guys

41:37.320 --> 41:38.790
to undo this sign.

41:38.790 --> 41:41.390
Basically I had 20 to
22 grand in the truck

41:41.390 --> 41:46.060
and it may be worth 30, now
I've got 5 grand in a sign.

41:46.070 --> 41:47.800
That's probably worth
somewhere around 10 grand.

41:47.800 --> 41:49.400
That's way less
money on the table,

41:49.400 --> 41:51.300
and much more product coming in.

41:51.300 --> 41:55.410
So there you go,
23.9 cents a gallon.
