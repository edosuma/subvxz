WEBVTT

00:00.576 --> 00:01.972
You holding up okay?

00:02.515 --> 00:03.871
Dying of boredom yet?

00:04.174 --> 00:04.916
Nuh-uh.

00:06.003 --> 00:08.595
Just 15 more minutes. Then we'll meet Mom and the girls

00:08.631 --> 00:10.830
by the shoe department, and then we'll go to the movie, okay?

00:11.162 --> 00:13.866
Okay, but what are you buying socks for?

00:13.928 --> 00:15.843
Don't you have plenty of socks at home?

00:16.006 --> 00:18.166
It's not like you're still growing.

00:18.305 --> 00:20.364
Well, you know, over time, they wear out.

00:20.430 --> 00:23.374
And sometimes the dryer eats them.

00:23.612 --> 00:26.641
You mean we have a dryer that eats things?

00:26.950 --> 00:27.694
Huh?

00:28.583 --> 00:31.749
Uh, no, no, it's just sometimes things get lost in there.

00:31.817 --> 00:32.953
Socks mostly.

00:33.256 --> 00:35.928
It's not like it actually eats anything.

00:36.194 --> 00:38.274
Stay here for just one second, baby.

00:38.711 --> 00:40.685
I just want to ask this salesman something.

00:41.104 --> 00:44.275
Excuse me, uh, I'm looking for these in the crew.

00:44.336 --> 00:45.252
I'll be right over, sir.

00:45.329 --> 00:46.075
Thank you.

00:51.110 --> 00:51.842
Bridgette?

00:53.618 --> 00:54.350
Bridgette?!

00:54.914 --> 00:55.477
Bridgette.

00:56.285 --> 00:56.860
Bridge?

00:59.838 --> 01:00.489
Bridge!

01:02.712 --> 01:03.372
Bridge!

01:08.068 --> 01:09.435
Bridgette Dubois?!

01:27.391 --> 01:28.091
Hey.

01:29.042 --> 01:31.116
It's 4:00 in the morning. What are you doing up?

01:31.576 --> 01:33.718
Hey. It's 4:00 in the morning.

01:34.112 --> 01:35.347
What are you doing out?

01:36.421 --> 01:38.183
What can I tell you. People are terrified.

01:38.249 --> 01:42.520
Every time a red-headed woman who lives alone hears the wind jangling a loose screen,

01:42.572 --> 01:44.987
she thinks she's got a close encounter with the Phoenix Phantom.

01:45.494 --> 01:46.257
And...?

01:47.669 --> 01:48.444
Not tonight.

01:50.322 --> 01:53.267
Not the three women that I sat with, thankfully,

01:53.358 --> 01:57.510
although I did have the distinct honor of watching the coroner

01:57.582 --> 02:02.350
pull the body of the first victim out of a Dumpster behind a gentleman's club.

02:04.029 --> 02:06.277
Ah... well...

02:08.916 --> 02:11.048
Okay, can you reset the alarm

02:11.648 --> 02:14.227
after you get up at 6:30 for me at noon?

02:14.300 --> 02:17.970
Absolutely. Wouldn't want to be late making the kids breakfast,

02:18.062 --> 02:20.008
getting them dressed, taking them to school,

02:20.331 --> 02:23.613
making them dinner or helping them out with their homework.

02:23.685 --> 02:24.535
I'm sorry.

02:24.719 --> 02:26.368
I'm... I know you are.

02:26.536 --> 02:27.852
I-I'm sorry.

02:29.413 --> 02:32.522
People are dying. You're trying to help. I get it. I do. It's just...

02:33.305 --> 02:35.399
It's... it's unfair.

02:39.197 --> 02:41.247
I can fix this. I swear.

02:49.161 --> 02:52.460
Oh... now let's just hope that between now and noon,

02:52.511 --> 02:55.348
I don't have any scary dreams that wake me up.

02:55.978 --> 02:57.865
Well, I don't think you need to worry about that.

02:58.767 --> 03:00.697
I already did that for you, too.

03:54.904 --> 03:55.984
Ow!

03:56.075 --> 03:56.749
I'm sorry.

03:56.973 --> 03:59.727
Mommy always puts her hand on the top of my head so the hair doesn't pull.

03:59.798 --> 04:01.078
Yeah, I'm sure she does.

04:01.236 --> 04:04.986
...was discovered yesterday evening in a Dumpster outside the Fantasy Lounge.

04:05.030 --> 04:07.720
Bridge... hey, hey. Bridge, Bridge... turn that off, will you?

04:07.853 --> 04:11.744
...apparent abduction three nights ago of Darlene Denise. Another redhead...

04:12.917 --> 04:14.288
She's eating cookies.

04:14.376 --> 04:15.286
Nuh-uh!

04:15.676 --> 04:16.798
You know what? I don't care.

04:16.874 --> 04:18.401
Everybody get their stuff together.

04:18.711 --> 04:20.053
Let's get this show on the road.

04:20.125 --> 04:21.677
Mommy's not taking us again today?

04:21.733 --> 04:23.382
Ariel, look around. Do you see Mommy?

04:25.992 --> 04:29.383
Come on. This isn't new. Mommy worked late, so Mommy's sleeping in.

04:33.557 --> 04:34.446
- Good night.
- Good night.

04:43.300 --> 04:44.737
Must be the night shift.

04:44.984 --> 04:46.064
He's waiting for you.

04:46.668 --> 04:47.723
Have a nice evening.

04:47.933 --> 04:48.712
Are you kidding?

04:48.808 --> 04:51.517
I'm going home and rinsing out the little bit of red I have left in my hair.

04:56.944 --> 04:57.819
Knock, knock.

04:58.521 --> 04:59.627
Tell me you had a dream.

04:59.817 --> 05:02.192
I had a dream. I was having dinner with my family.

05:02.504 --> 05:03.355
Keep dreaming.

05:03.902 --> 05:06.195
We had 11 calls last night from women convinced the Phantom

05:06.257 --> 05:09.764
was trying to break into their homes or apartments from virtually every precinct in the city.

05:09.831 --> 05:12.018
We've still got guys out in the field running them down.

05:12.340 --> 05:14.633
Allison and I interviewed three of them ourselves.

05:14.705 --> 05:15.371
And...?

05:15.570 --> 05:18.960
And two of them were genuinely frightened although without cause.

05:19.303 --> 05:22.278
The other one, she just wanted some attention from her boyfriend.

05:23.338 --> 05:25.044
All together, since the second disappearance, we've had

05:25.109 --> 05:27.890
over  1,400 calls, tips, supposed sightings,

05:27.986 --> 05:29.563
even six confessions.

05:30.963 --> 05:32.430
What's the "want"?

05:32.523 --> 05:35.062
What's the "goal"? I mean, it can't just be about red hair.

05:35.150 --> 05:36.931
Whoever did it, they know how to break and enter.

05:37.120 --> 05:38.606
Places are clean as a whistle.

05:39.328 --> 05:42.518
These abductions are planned and extremely well-thought-out.

05:42.905 --> 05:43.961
They're not random.

05:45.114 --> 05:45.969
Excuse me.

05:49.702 --> 05:50.386
It's home.

05:51.072 --> 05:51.688
Hello?

05:52.910 --> 05:53.791
Hi, baby.

05:54.155 --> 05:55.030
Just a second.

05:55.406 --> 05:56.377
It's my oldest.

05:57.954 --> 05:58.723
Scanlon.

05:59.676 --> 06:00.970
Ariel, everything okay?

06:01.133 --> 06:04.385
Yeah. I was just wondering if you knew yet.

06:04.764 --> 06:05.773
Knew what?

06:05.904 --> 06:08.823
About tomorrow. Horseback riding.

06:11.206 --> 06:13.832
It would just be a lot more fun if you could go, too.

06:14.309 --> 06:16.114
You know what? Let me talk to my boss.

06:16.171 --> 06:18.408
See what I can do, okay? I'll call you back, baby.

06:18.677 --> 06:19.546
Bye.

06:21.967 --> 06:22.869
I have a problem.

06:23.832 --> 06:26.754
I mean, I don't mind working as a human lie detector,

06:26.976 --> 06:31.987
but it's been four nights in a row now, and, frankly, my family is starting to lose it.

06:32.755 --> 06:34.890
Is there any way I could take a pass tonight?

06:35.766 --> 06:36.887
We just got a call.

06:37.240 --> 06:38.756
Apparently he's struck again.

06:45.367 --> 06:46.703
You're awfully quiet tonight.

06:47.076 --> 06:49.508
Hmm. Count your blessings.

06:49.609 --> 06:51.013
Sounds like a dare.

06:51.756 --> 06:54.470
Don't  mind me. I'm just frustrated, that's all.

06:55.432 --> 06:56.748
What are you frustrated about?

06:57.029 --> 07:00.127
That I'm here, that everyone's frustrated with me.

07:00.716 --> 07:02.227
There's nothing I can do about it.

07:02.293 --> 07:04.489
I'm guessing we're talking about the home front, 'cause...

07:04.826 --> 07:06.824
no around here is frustrated with you.

07:08.509 --> 07:09.657
Look, I'll make you a deal.

07:10.014 --> 07:12.943
Let's just check out this crime scene. It'll take all of half an hour.

07:13.024 --> 07:14.997
If nothing happens for you, then we'll call it a night.

07:15.396 --> 07:17.966
No home visits, no interviews. You'll be back at your car by 10:00.

07:18.011 --> 07:19.577
Home by 11:00. How does that sound?

07:19.686 --> 07:21.472
That sounds fantastic.

07:23.628 --> 07:24.560
God, I'm nice.

07:30.153 --> 07:30.807
'Evening.

07:31.906 --> 07:32.635
That it is.

07:32.967 --> 07:33.884
Who have we got here?

07:34.539 --> 07:37.457
The mother had been calling for two days, saying she was trying to reach her child.

07:37.718 --> 07:38.835
We finally got over here.

07:39.029 --> 07:40.037
Landlord let us in.

07:40.309 --> 07:41.476
Seems to fit the pattern.

07:41.824 --> 07:43.802
The victim appears to have been roused from sleep.

07:43.868 --> 07:45.900
Haven't found any blood or DNA just yet.

07:46.234 --> 07:47.415
No signs of a struggle.

07:48.202 --> 07:49.031
Redhead?

07:49.180 --> 07:49.904
Of course.

07:50.043 --> 07:51.179
Can I see the bedroom?

07:51.697 --> 07:53.893
This is Allison Dubois. She's with the D.A.

07:55.183 --> 07:56.135
Right through there.

08:12.954 --> 08:13.605
Find anything?

08:18.577 --> 08:19.938
Well, then, it's unanimous.

08:20.275 --> 08:22.698
The crime scene techs found some nothing in the kitchen.

08:22.922 --> 08:25.427
That led them in here where they found a little more nothing.

08:26.150 --> 08:28.867
Now they're checking the perimeter which, if everything goes according to pattern,

08:28.929 --> 08:30.408
will yield absolutely nothing.

08:32.087 --> 08:32.907
Hey, honey.

08:33.654 --> 08:34.515
Hang on a sec.

08:34.934 --> 08:36.235
We'll be out of here in 15.

08:37.004 --> 08:38.140
I'll be back.

08:41.580 --> 08:43.613
Hey, eldest child, good news.

08:43.690 --> 08:46.361
Mommy's leaving work shortly, which means...

08:47.789 --> 08:49.932
I'll be going horseback riding with you!

08:52.092 --> 08:54.315
Yes. Tell Daddy I should be home by 11:00.

08:55.646 --> 08:56.745
Sure, put him on.

08:58.083 --> 08:59.721
We're looking for Isaiah, men.

08:59.844 --> 09:01.104
Find me Isaiah.

09:08.163 --> 09:08.983
Hello.

09:12.091 --> 09:13.658
I think I might've found it.

09:14.072 --> 09:15.777
I think it's on this mirror.

09:17.206 --> 09:19.232
I'm sorry, sir but I just don't see it.

09:19.310 --> 09:20.067
Allison?

09:20.738 --> 09:22.562
He did it with his finger. Come here.

09:22.971 --> 09:23.698
Allison?

09:24.086 --> 09:25.230
Joe, I gotta call you back.

09:26.432 --> 09:27.881
You still don't see it, do you?

09:29.531 --> 09:31.143
Let me show you something.

09:38.418 --> 09:39.181
There we go.

09:42.493 --> 09:43.574
There it is.

09:44.998 --> 09:47.685
Isaiah 14:21.

09:49.124 --> 09:49.902
Damn it!

09:51.192 --> 09:52.042
I see him.

09:57.700 --> 09:58.403
All right.

09:59.205 --> 10:00.066
You still on the phone?

10:01.387 --> 10:02.063
Allison...

10:03.149 --> 10:04.300
you ready to get out of here?

10:09.939 --> 10:11.632
I think he left us a message.

10:11.719 --> 10:12.620
Who are you talking about?

10:12.721 --> 10:15.133
I didn't get anything in the bedroom because it didn't happen in the bedroom.

10:15.204 --> 10:16.455
It happened in here.

10:18.697 --> 10:19.736
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

10:19.811 --> 10:21.610
There may be evidence in there. You probably shouldn't...

10:21.678 --> 10:22.435
Look at the mirror.

10:25.275 --> 10:26.233
What is that?

10:28.835 --> 10:30.915
It's a message. It's a piece of scripture.

10:31.186 --> 10:33.474
I think he's trying to tell us something.

10:50.888 --> 10:52.828
I am not a toy.

10:53.400 --> 10:54.886
I'm  not a thing.

10:55.148 --> 10:56.539
You're hung up on me.

10:57.747 --> 11:01.316
You can't just start kissing me and expect everything to be all right.

11:04.427 --> 11:06.023
Boy, you give up easily.

11:10.605 --> 11:12.698
Wow. Actually home before midnight.

11:12.832 --> 11:14.051
You talking to me, toy?

11:14.275 --> 11:15.806
You talking to me, thing?

11:15.954 --> 11:17.823
Someone is very cocky.

11:18.238 --> 11:19.943
Well,  I cracked the case.

11:20.998 --> 11:22.038
Caught the guy?

11:22.703 --> 11:24.121
Well, I nicked the case.

11:24.459 --> 11:26.247
Turns out the killer left a message

11:26.436 --> 11:28.320
and nobody saw it but me.

11:29.764 --> 11:31.059
I'm proud of you, baby.

11:32.467 --> 11:33.204
Are you?

11:33.762 --> 11:34.520
Yeah.

11:35.099 --> 11:36.538
I'm always proud of you.

11:36.859 --> 11:39.830
Whatever else, I am always proud of you.

11:41.468 --> 11:42.830
Want to hear something funny?

11:42.973 --> 11:45.666
You going to start, start calling me "toy" again, huh?

11:47.008 --> 11:48.784
You know who showed me the clue?

11:48.868 --> 11:49.286
Who?

11:49.358 --> 11:52.030
Captain Kenneth Push of the Texas Rangers.

11:52.231 --> 11:53.868
I don't get it? What was he doing there?

11:53.981 --> 11:55.579
Well, that's the thing-- he wasn't there,

11:55.938 --> 11:57.392
it was a vision I had.

12:00.699 --> 12:05.599
That's right. You've haven't met the amazing Captain Kenneth Push.

12:06.085 --> 12:08.799
Trust me, you have nothing to worry about.

12:09.203 --> 12:10.966
- Oh, really?
- Mm-hmm.

12:11.036 --> 12:12.598
Are you prepared to prove that?

12:12.864 --> 12:13.668
Maybe.

12:14.207 --> 12:15.188
On your mark.

12:15.978 --> 12:17.104
Get set...

12:17.554 --> 12:18.266
Go!

12:18.549 --> 12:19.306
Hey.

12:34.998 --> 12:35.736
Mom?

12:37.404 --> 12:39.984
Can you still ride horses in a hurricane?

12:45.008 --> 12:46.835
Aren't there supposed to be two dice?

12:46.934 --> 12:48.833
What's the difference? We'll just play with one dice.

12:48.925 --> 12:52.370
I don't think that's gonna work 'cause you have to move at least seven paces for the game to work.

12:52.463 --> 12:53.804
Well, just double whatever you roll.

12:53.896 --> 12:55.652
Well, then you're never gonna roll an odd number.

12:56.041 --> 12:58.044
I'll just get a dice from another game.

12:58.124 --> 12:59.247
You can't be everything.

12:59.478 --> 13:02.631
Can, too. Mommy said that I can be anything I want to be.

13:02.846 --> 13:04.689
She wasn't talking about the game, stupid.

13:04.776 --> 13:05.836
She was talking about life.

13:05.934 --> 13:07.680
Games is a part of life.

13:08.002 --> 13:10.685
Hey, admit it. Isn't this so much more fun than horseback riding?

13:10.793 --> 13:12.108
Not if I can't be orange.

13:12.195 --> 13:14.335
Okay. Girls, enough. Stop.

13:14.428 --> 13:17.750
For the rest of today, everyone's going to be something they've never been before.

13:17.814 --> 13:18.943
What do you mean?

13:19.261 --> 13:22.251
I mean... Daddy is going to be green.

13:22.993 --> 13:25.031
Mommy is going to be orange,

13:25.129 --> 13:27.110
and you girls can be something new.

13:27.243 --> 13:28.718
Ariel. You're going to be yellow.

13:28.939 --> 13:30.188
Bridgette, you're blue.

13:30.551 --> 13:33.101
Blue? Blue is a boy's color.

13:33.618 --> 13:34.646
Here we go...

13:37.237 --> 13:38.128
Hold on a second.

13:41.636 --> 13:42.450
Hello?

13:42.829 --> 13:44.446
Captain Push, you got my message.

13:49.429 --> 13:53.681
Since I saw you, I've been doing a lot of work for the local district attorney's office.

13:53.883 --> 13:55.818
Some pretty interesting stuff, really,

13:56.049 --> 13:57.856
which  is what I'm calling you about.

13:58.261 --> 14:01.573
This is gonna sound kind of strange, but if I say to you,

14:02.009 --> 14:05.669
"Isaiah 14:21," does that ring any bells?

14:08.869 --> 14:09.832
Good news.

14:10.579 --> 14:11.814
What's the good news?

14:14.430 --> 14:16.166
Hey, I thought we were gonna play a game?

14:16.422 --> 14:18.935
Yeah, that was an hour and 20 minutes ago.

14:21.054 --> 14:22.448
I-I'm sorry.

14:22.602 --> 14:23.712
I just, I...

14:27.198 --> 14:29.533
It turns out there is a connection.

14:29.697 --> 14:33.251
A killer with the same M.O. made his way across South Texas a couple of years ago,

14:33.313 --> 14:35.976
so I called Devalos. The three of us conferenced.

14:36.932 --> 14:38.960
He's flying out to meet us tomorrow.

14:39.891 --> 14:40.814
Sunday?

14:45.632 --> 14:46.917
Miss Dubois.

14:54.483 --> 14:58.236
In April of 2002, the state comptroller called me up.

14:59.163 --> 15:02.348
His sister's 19-year-old daughter was going to school in Austin

15:02.439 --> 15:04.391
and she hadn't called home in over a week.

15:04.852 --> 15:07.009
So I went down there to take a look.

15:07.089 --> 15:11.472
I was about half certain she was in Corpus or Cabo or Daytona,

15:11.549 --> 15:14.692
one of these spring break towns where they stop serving you beer

15:14.744 --> 15:16.730
if they find out you been calling your folks.

15:18.921 --> 15:20.178
Three days later,

15:20.889 --> 15:24.287
we found her body behind a massage parlor off the I-10.

15:24.835 --> 15:29.116
Over the next 11 days, there were two more kids reported missing--

15:29.602 --> 15:32.070
a 20-year-old Galveston woman

15:32.172 --> 15:35.014
and an 18-year-old fellow from Houston.

15:35.249 --> 15:37.369
Sorry. Did you say one of your victims was male?

15:38.576 --> 15:39.320
Yes, sir.

15:39.883 --> 15:41.444
Was he by any chance a redhead?

15:42.914 --> 15:44.312
None of them had red hair.

15:45.902 --> 15:50.630
Well, now I'm starting to wonder if we're all talking about the same perpetrator.

15:50.758 --> 15:53.895
Our profilers seem fairly sure that what we're dealing with here in Arizona

15:53.957 --> 15:57.640
is some kind of sex killer who is only interested in redheaded women.

16:00.741 --> 16:03.690
You just have the one girl so far, right?

16:04.285 --> 16:05.108
One body?

16:06.481 --> 16:07.639
Either of you see her?

16:07.787 --> 16:09.329
Detective Scanlon and I did.

16:09.390 --> 16:12.522
We watched the coroner fish the body out of a Dumpster the other night.

16:13.306 --> 16:13.967
And?

16:14.458 --> 16:17.924
And it looked like she'd been stabbed, or worse. She was covered with blood.

16:19.440 --> 16:21.211
Any autopsy results yet?

16:21.299 --> 16:22.599
Due in first thing tomorrow.

16:22.983 --> 16:24.826
Well, let me tell you what they're going to say.

16:25.164 --> 16:27.269
The girl's going to be clean as a whistle.

16:27.556 --> 16:30.997
No signs of sexual violation whatsoever.

16:32.139 --> 16:35.641
She will, however, be missing her heart.

16:36.301 --> 16:37.018
Excuse me?

16:41.574 --> 16:42.987
He takes their hearts.

16:43.647 --> 16:45.634
Carves it right out of their chest.

16:46.628 --> 16:49.060
Doesn't have anything to do with sex.

16:49.966 --> 16:51.057
It's Biblical.

16:52.098 --> 16:55.531
Isaiah, Chapter 14, Verse 12. 

16:56.802 --> 16:59.017
Prepare slaughter for their children,

16:59.167 --> 17:01.019
for the iniquity of their fathers;

17:01.348 --> 17:04.444
that they do not rise, nor possess the land,

17:04.551 --> 17:06.215
nor fill the face of the world.

17:06.903 --> 17:09.657
Every time we'd find a body, there it'd be.

17:09.759 --> 17:13.892
Every time we'd go to a residence or someone was reported missing.

17:14.013 --> 17:16.027
Wait a second. Let's not jump the gun here.

17:16.114 --> 17:18.786
This Isaiah thing was on a mirror the other night. That's the only time.

17:18.857 --> 17:19.539
Excuse me.

17:20.134 --> 17:23.486
When you found that body, did you look in the Dumpster?

17:27.290 --> 17:30.973
Well, look in the Dumpster again. Look all around the Dumpster.

17:31.034 --> 17:32.816
Look under the Dumpster.

17:32.948 --> 17:36.513
I'm betting you, it's there. It's the guy's M.O.

17:36.737 --> 17:41.524
It's like writing in the mist on a mirror where you might not see it.

17:41.591 --> 17:44.366
This guy wants you to have to look for it.

17:44.417 --> 17:46.420
He wants you to have to work for it.

17:46.706 --> 17:48.289
You're a philistine.

17:48.792 --> 17:50.291
We're all philistines.

17:50.434 --> 17:52.814
I still think it's possible we're talking about another guy,

17:53.326 --> 17:54.270
a copycat.

17:54.377 --> 17:55.436
It's possible...

17:56.087 --> 17:57.265
but I doubt it.

17:57.894 --> 18:00.010
We never went public with the quotes.

18:01.120 --> 18:04.217
Didn't want to encourage him.

18:04.959 --> 18:06.480
Okay, so where does this leave us?

18:06.634 --> 18:08.964
A  quotation from the Bible about children

18:09.127 --> 18:11.944
being killed for the sins of their fathers. I'm not sure I get it.

18:12.062 --> 18:13.249
Well, don't feel bad.

18:13.330 --> 18:14.656
I didn't get it either.

18:15.318 --> 18:18.701
11 days, three kids, and then... it stopped.

18:19.767 --> 18:22.746
Like a... storm. Just-- pff!-- gone.

18:25.613 --> 18:27.257
I figured he's dead.

18:29.991 --> 18:31.476
Apparently I figured wrong.

18:35.536 --> 18:38.168
This is completely unnecessary, you know.

18:38.619 --> 18:42.069
Takeout rotisserie chicken and sides served on dinner plates

18:42.115 --> 18:43.815
with three kids fighting over the wishbone?

18:43.888 --> 18:45.557
This is something you're willing to pass up?

18:47.221 --> 18:49.545
All right. This one time.

18:52.530 --> 18:53.727
So how's your heart?

18:56.601 --> 18:57.881
It's happy to be here.

19:00.834 --> 19:03.073
Well, I finally met the amazing Captain Push.

19:03.165 --> 19:04.015
And?

19:04.158 --> 19:05.407
I thought he'd be taller.

19:05.704 --> 19:07.589
Ooh. Someone's in a mood.

19:07.671 --> 19:10.184
What are you talking about? It's 6:30 on Sunday night.

19:10.318 --> 19:14.117
I've spent all day entertaining the kids and now I'm spending all night entertaining a surprise guest.

19:14.266 --> 19:15.442
Why would I be in a mood?

19:17.342 --> 19:18.735
And I rode Whisper.

19:18.816 --> 19:21.899
And I rode Lightning, and Daddy and Marie rode...

19:22.190 --> 19:23.107
Old Glue.

19:23.384 --> 19:24.540
Old Glue?

19:24.946 --> 19:27.266
He was very... very gentle.

19:27.388 --> 19:29.159
Mommy, it was so much fun.

19:29.236 --> 19:31.769
I know. Daddy said it was the most fun ever.

19:32.370 --> 19:36.691
The only thing that would make it funner was if we had our own ponies.

19:36.783 --> 19:37.862
Excuse me?

19:38.088 --> 19:39.343
Who gave you that idea?

19:39.446 --> 19:41.806
Danielle Moynihan. She has her own pony.

19:41.862 --> 19:43.693
We saw her riding it when we left the stable.

19:43.935 --> 19:46.367
Ladies, we have a guest.

19:46.485 --> 19:47.857
Now's not the time to be discussing...

19:47.940 --> 19:49.614
I had a pony growing up.

19:50.008 --> 19:50.874
You did?

19:51.104 --> 19:52.199
What was his name?

19:52.747 --> 19:53.941
Jacinto.

19:55.062 --> 19:57.018
He was named after a great battle.

19:57.355 --> 19:58.973
Why? Was he mean?

19:59.357 --> 20:00.541
No.

20:01.626 --> 20:03.674
He sure did make a mess, though.

20:04.288 --> 20:05.188
A mess?

20:06.455 --> 20:07.309
How?

20:07.975 --> 20:11.097
Well, you know how when you have a cat,

20:11.262 --> 20:13.125
you have to clean up his litter box?

20:13.729 --> 20:16.653
Well, you imagine doing that for something so big,

20:17.263 --> 20:22.633
he leaves behind six or seven shoe boxes full of manure every day.

20:23.509 --> 20:27.159
Only it's not in shoe boxes. You got to shovel it.

20:27.359 --> 20:29.979
Every morning, every night.

20:30.411 --> 20:32.900
Every morning and every night?!

20:33.057 --> 20:35.618
Plus you got to feed him twice a day.

20:35.771 --> 20:39.042
12 gallons of water, half a bale of hay.

20:39.166 --> 20:42.515
You gotta pick up his hooves, check them for thrush.

20:42.628 --> 20:44.905
You gotta stay with him when he's sick.

20:45.541 --> 20:47.690
Do horses get sick a lot?

20:47.874 --> 20:51.080
Well, my horse got very sick at the end.

20:52.493 --> 20:54.035
He had colic.

20:54.915 --> 20:55.779
Bad.

20:57.373 --> 20:59.364
I had colic.

21:00.968 --> 21:05.944
We had to take a tube and run it down his nose

21:06.020 --> 21:10.680
and pump oil through it to try to get his belly to loosen up.

21:14.725 --> 21:17.437
Unfortunately... it didn't do the trick.

21:20.245 --> 21:21.340
He died.

21:25.559 --> 21:27.191
Does anyone feel like dessert?

21:27.591 --> 21:28.514
Oh, yeah.

21:28.620 --> 21:30.366
Okay, girls, come help me with dessert.

21:32.019 --> 21:32.886
Thanks.

21:35.118 --> 21:37.683
All right, he did get taller as the night went on.

21:37.755 --> 21:39.234
You like him. I know you do.

21:39.397 --> 21:40.597
All right, I liked him.

21:40.920 --> 21:42.906
I'm gonna tell him tomorrow when I take him to the airport.

21:43.009 --> 21:44.136
I'm gonna tell him.

21:44.200 --> 21:45.179
Okay, you do that.

21:49.413 --> 21:50.842
And now that's out of the way,

21:51.087 --> 21:54.282
what do you say we call a moratorium on all things, topics

21:54.369 --> 21:58.726
and people work-related, just for the next nine hours or so, huh?

21:58.859 --> 22:00.636
Would that make you happy, toy?

22:01.133 --> 22:03.242
Would that make you happy, thing?

22:03.934 --> 22:04.804
Shut up.

22:10.293 --> 22:11.214
Ms. Dubois?

22:13.963 --> 22:15.556
Ms. Dubois, wake up.

22:16.477 --> 22:17.394
Ms. Dubois.

22:18.531 --> 22:20.451
As soon as it happened I had to tell you.

22:20.805 --> 22:22.928
As soon as it happened I had to let you know.

22:23.042 --> 22:23.908
You were right.

22:24.173 --> 22:25.412
You were right all along.

22:25.498 --> 22:27.553
What are you talking about? Oh, my God, what are you doing here?

22:27.629 --> 22:31.019
First thing that hits you is everything you know.

22:31.104 --> 22:35.186
Everything. Your whole dang life. It hits you like a wave.

22:35.391 --> 22:37.962
Takes a second, but you see it all,

22:38.172 --> 22:42.242
feel it all, too-- the... sadness, the exultation.

22:42.308 --> 22:44.745
It's all in there, and it's not even a second.

22:44.971 --> 22:47.931
And then, the second wave is everything you don't know.

22:48.155 --> 22:49.963
Everything you ever wondered about.

22:50.050 --> 22:51.103
Everything.

22:51.207 --> 22:52.222
Captain Push...

22:52.635 --> 22:54.873
my husband, it-it's 3:30 in the morning.

22:54.934 --> 22:59.019
You're just... annihilated with extraordinary clarity. I mean, I see it all from here.

22:59.101 --> 23:02.707
I see everything. Allison... they're related.

23:02.860 --> 23:03.648
What's related?

23:03.724 --> 23:06.316
The murders, the victims, the ones he chooses.

23:06.500 --> 23:07.621
It's not random.

23:07.806 --> 23:08.507
Okay...

23:08.589 --> 23:09.957
And there's another girl.

23:10.232 --> 23:11.872
She's next on his list.

23:12.219 --> 23:13.197
Her name is...

23:25.002 --> 23:26.319
I'll get the baby.

23:26.417 --> 23:27.825
You wake the girls.

23:36.501 --> 23:37.508
Good morning, ma'am.

23:37.600 --> 23:38.279
Morning.

23:38.424 --> 23:40.758
I was wondering if you could ring up Kenneth Push's room

23:40.820 --> 23:42.305
and let him know that his ride's in the lobby?

23:42.366 --> 23:43.088
Certainly.

23:47.774 --> 23:49.744
You haven't by chance spoken with Mr. Push

23:49.815 --> 23:52.136
or any members of his family this morning, have you?

23:52.202 --> 23:52.805
What?

23:53.850 --> 23:55.421
I don't really have all the details.

23:55.652 --> 23:58.116
All I know is that they called an ambulance for Mr. Push

23:58.202 --> 23:59.754
sometime after 3:00 this morning.

23:59.846 --> 24:01.505
They took him over to St. Christopher's Hospital.

24:05.095 --> 24:07.809
Now, look, Captain Push, I appreciate you're far from home

24:07.951 --> 24:11.377
but these temporary pacemakers are only designed to work three or four days at a time

24:11.448 --> 24:14.253
before a permanent unit can be placed inside the body.

24:14.648 --> 24:16.374
It's a pretty straightforward procedure.

24:16.455 --> 24:18.944
I wish you would reconsider and let me do it.

24:19.093 --> 24:20.029
Doctor...

24:20.812 --> 24:23.179
this is the first time you and I have met, right?

24:23.659 --> 24:25.088
No offense, but...

24:25.656 --> 24:29.865
I'm not in the habit of letting a perfect stranger slice me up the middle

24:30.360 --> 24:34.202
and install miniature electronics in my chest.

24:35.594 --> 24:40.402
Now, I have a wonderful doctor back home who knows me inside and out,

24:40.652 --> 24:44.124
and in a day and a half, when you let me out of this bed,

24:44.354 --> 24:46.058
I'm flying back to Texas,

24:46.265 --> 24:49.018
and I'll have him do whatever is necessary.

24:49.182 --> 24:50.293
You causing trouble?

24:50.683 --> 24:51.722
Uh-huh.

24:57.015 --> 24:57.887
You Mrs. Dubois?

24:58.398 --> 25:01.998
Yup. I'm the woman who fed him whatever it is that put him in here.

25:02.461 --> 25:05.055
Well, maybe you can convince him to let me operate,

25:05.126 --> 25:07.440
put in that pacemaker so he can go back home.

25:07.574 --> 25:09.237
I'm fine.

25:10.068 --> 25:12.699
I got this outboard model right here.

25:14.004 --> 25:17.573
Tells my heart when to beat, holds all my addresses and phone numbers.

25:17.666 --> 25:20.114
I even get AM/FM radio.

25:20.241 --> 25:20.876
Yeah.

25:20.993 --> 25:25.448
Well, I'm gonna go ahead and call your doctor in Houston, see if he can't convince you.

25:26.037 --> 25:27.051
Mrs. Dubois.

25:28.780 --> 25:31.116
He's gonna phone my doctor in Houston...

25:31.407 --> 25:32.826
Oh, boy.

25:34.240 --> 25:37.254
I let you out of my sight for 20 minutes.

25:37.700 --> 25:39.636
I don't know what to tell you.

25:39.973 --> 25:41.827
Woke up in the middle of the night.

25:42.508 --> 25:44.433
Recognized the feeling.

25:45.032 --> 25:47.326
Knew exactly what was happening.

25:47.894 --> 25:50.690
Called downstairs to the desk and must have...

25:51.017 --> 25:53.254
blacked out right after that.

25:53.889 --> 25:56.783
Next thing I know, they're working on an ambulance.

25:57.479 --> 26:00.080
I'm guessing this was around 3:30 in the morning.

26:00.220 --> 26:02.434
Yeah. I don't know.

26:02.548 --> 26:05.098
You were wearing blue boxers and a white T-shirt.

26:07.311 --> 26:09.777
You gonna guess my weight now?

26:10.588 --> 26:12.568
I think you came to see me last night.

26:14.446 --> 26:15.271
Come again?

26:15.830 --> 26:18.112
You came to visit me, in my bedroom.

26:18.195 --> 26:19.576
It was around 3:30 in the morning.

26:19.648 --> 26:21.098
I thought that I was dreaming.

26:21.866 --> 26:23.136
I didn't know what was happening.

26:23.212 --> 26:24.405
But now I realize...

26:25.261 --> 26:26.428
it was you.

26:30.104 --> 26:32.526
You must have died for a minute or two.

26:35.578 --> 26:38.367
I know you have a difficult time with this kind of thing.

26:39.561 --> 26:41.174
I don't know what to say.

26:44.542 --> 26:46.494
Showed up in my boxers, huh?

26:47.912 --> 26:49.827
Hope I didn't offend the other guests.

26:52.290 --> 26:55.346
You said that where you were, you could see everything,

26:55.607 --> 26:58.347
that you had this enormous clarity.

26:59.289 --> 27:00.379
Allison...

27:00.829 --> 27:04.408
You were very excited-- you told me that all the murders were related.

27:05.059 --> 27:07.465
That the victims weren't random.

27:08.228 --> 27:09.825
Not random, huh?

27:10.916 --> 27:15.529
That hardly seems like a revelation worthy of a near-death experience.

27:16.046 --> 27:18.730
And then you said you knew who the next victim would be.

27:20.940 --> 27:21.780
And...?

27:22.375 --> 27:23.168
And...

27:26.169 --> 27:28.386
I guess that's when they brought you back to life.

27:28.841 --> 27:30.654
You never said their name.

27:30.858 --> 27:32.379
You just disappeared.

27:33.137 --> 27:34.687
Or I fell asleep, or...

27:37.826 --> 27:40.996
I know you well enough to know that you wouldn't be telling me these things

27:41.043 --> 27:43.295
if you didn't believe them with all your heart.

27:45.047 --> 27:45.973
Captain Push...

27:46.086 --> 27:50.274
I have no recollection of seeing anyone last night

27:50.350 --> 27:56.694
except a very frightened hotel manager and a couple very able EMS guys

27:56.780 --> 28:01.583
whose names I don't remember and who probably saved my life.

28:03.412 --> 28:04.221
Allison...

28:05.889 --> 28:07.467
I'm a lawman.

28:09.504 --> 28:13.867
This maniac killed three Texans.

28:14.420 --> 28:18.449
Don't you think I'd tell you if I knew what tied all these people together?

28:18.603 --> 28:24.013
Don't you think I'd tell you if I knew who he was fixin' to kill next?

28:24.722 --> 28:25.776
Of course.

28:27.921 --> 28:29.037
Related? How?

28:29.155 --> 28:30.732
You're not giving me much to work with.

28:31.100 --> 28:32.877
I don't know, they're just related.

28:32.974 --> 28:35.382
And you came upon this startling revelation how?

28:36.159 --> 28:37.333
It's not important.

28:37.721 --> 28:38.617
Okay.

28:43.890 --> 28:45.897
It's Detective Scanlon. Damn.

28:46.021 --> 28:48.401
It's 2:40. You'll wake the baby.

28:48.482 --> 28:49.822
Just click it and hang up.

28:53.849 --> 28:55.221
Allison...

28:55.283 --> 28:57.245
All right, talk to him. I'll get the baby.

28:57.336 --> 28:58.015
Hello?

28:58.237 --> 29:00.618
No, it's okay, he understands. What's going on?

29:01.002 --> 29:04.058
We found the bodies of Darlene Denise and, uh, Katie Fisher.

29:04.591 --> 29:06.255
Okay, where did he leave them?

29:07.361 --> 29:09.338
A church. Downtown.

29:09.963 --> 29:11.657
Right in the middle of Metro district.

29:12.717 --> 29:14.811
Wait a second, does that fit the pattern?

29:14.958 --> 29:17.478
Well, it's not a nudie bar and it's not an abortion clinic,

29:17.545 --> 29:19.479
but it's kind of a nontraditional church.

29:20.371 --> 29:22.429
Female priest. Gay choir.

29:23.366 --> 29:25.977
I mean, if you're the kind of killer who likes fire with his brimstone,

29:26.054 --> 29:27.995
it's probably the kind of place that would tick you off.

29:28.399 --> 29:29.560
What about Isaiah?

29:29.888 --> 29:34.175
He's here-- every prayerbook in every pew, there's a bookmark so you open right to it.

29:35.900 --> 29:37.026
So, you want to come down?

29:37.840 --> 29:39.087
I can send a car for you.

29:40.022 --> 29:40.881
It's up to you.

29:41.378 --> 29:43.430
I just thought you might want to come down here and, uh...

29:44.782 --> 29:46.013
commune.

29:47.128 --> 29:47.806
You know what?

29:48.065 --> 29:50.094
Let's talk tomorrow. I'll give you a call.

29:50.579 --> 29:52.382
All right. Absolutely.

29:52.925 --> 29:53.804
'Kay, thanks.

29:55.592 --> 29:56.702
Is it anything important?

29:57.195 --> 29:58.090
Nah.

29:58.884 --> 30:00.133
Shh... sweetheart.

30:02.273 --> 30:03.717
You're making the right decision.

30:04.244 --> 30:05.452
Don't gloat.

30:06.369 --> 30:08.146
I'm not making any decision.

30:08.622 --> 30:11.243
You brain-washed my doctor back home.

30:17.898 --> 30:19.036
Captain Push here.

30:19.282 --> 30:20.905
Allison Dubois here.

30:22.755 --> 30:25.492
Well, you're in an awfully good mood.

30:26.501 --> 30:31.918
I'll bet that's 'cause you're not surrounded by people hell-bent on playing with your innards.

30:32.005 --> 30:36.823
No. But I am staring at my little baby who has a bit of a fever-- which is why I'm calling.

30:37.136 --> 30:39.818
I really wanted to stop by and see you today before you left,

30:39.905 --> 30:41.853
but I just don't know how I'm gonna do it.

30:41.995 --> 30:46.137
Well, then I have some good news and I have some bad news.

30:46.366 --> 30:49.649
The good news is, I'm not leaving quite so fast.

30:50.586 --> 30:53.878
The bad news is, they're opening up my chest tomorrow morning,

30:53.944 --> 30:58.025
and I may not feel too much like entertaining after that.

30:58.107 --> 30:58.942
Oh, no.

30:59.555 --> 31:03.995
Well, maybe I could swing by and see you after my husband gets home.

31:04.313 --> 31:09.928
Hell, I'll have them dress me in some fresh gauze if I know you're coming.

31:11.142 --> 31:12.059
It's a deal.

31:13.905 --> 31:17.170
Captain Push, forgive me, I'm getting another call.

31:17.287 --> 31:18.803
Give me a second, I'll get rid of 'em.

31:20.578 --> 31:21.403
Hello?

31:21.957 --> 31:22.791
Allison.

31:23.845 --> 31:25.049
Good afternoon, sir.

31:25.197 --> 31:26.917
I have somebody on the other line. Let me just...

31:26.979 --> 31:29.166
That's all right, this'll just take a moment.

31:29.841 --> 31:32.340
Now that we have two bodies, and based on our conversation yesterday,

31:32.400 --> 31:35.443
I took a flier and ordered up some comparative DNA.

31:35.545 --> 31:38.647
Now, I just received the first report about 20 minutes ago, and...

31:39.974 --> 31:42.104
Allison, these two women are related.

31:44.812 --> 31:45.791
Excuse me?

31:46.037 --> 31:50.133
I haven't figured out how quite yet, but according to their DNA markers,

31:50.219 --> 31:52.743
both women have the same father.

31:55.558 --> 31:56.333
Allison?

31:57.410 --> 31:59.153
I-I'm sorry, I just, uh...

31:59.332 --> 32:01.103
Just thought you'd want to know.

32:01.682 --> 32:02.759
- Thank you.
- Bye.

32:03.609 --> 32:04.851
Hello? Are you still there?

32:05.128 --> 32:09.967
That is not the kind of thing you want to be asking a man in my condition.

32:10.649 --> 32:13.659
Okay, I hear no laughter.

32:14.313 --> 32:15.456
You all right?

32:15.564 --> 32:17.580
Yeah. N-No. I just...

32:17.720 --> 32:21.426
That was the office-- they ran some comparative DNA on our first two victims.

32:21.538 --> 32:23.522
They don't understand how,

32:23.647 --> 32:27.344
but according to the lab, both of these women are actually related.

32:27.452 --> 32:30.831
From a genetic standpoint, they have the same father.

32:34.673 --> 32:35.843
Captain Push?

32:37.845 --> 32:38.911
My goodness.

33:23.712 --> 33:24.792
Hey, everybody.

33:32.977 --> 33:33.695
Hi, Daddy.

33:33.889 --> 33:34.458
Hi.

33:35.374 --> 33:37.196
Wow, Daddy, who's that for?

33:38.278 --> 33:40.715
The balloon is for Marie, the wine's for Mommy and me.

33:40.806 --> 33:41.559
Where's everyone?

33:42.511 --> 33:45.087
Marie's sleeping and Mom's getting dressed.

33:49.936 --> 33:50.540
Hey.

33:51.241 --> 33:53.991
Thank God. I was hoping you'd show up about 15 minutes ago.

33:54.427 --> 33:56.377
I stopped to pick up a couple of things.

33:56.763 --> 33:58.159
Are you going somewhere?

33:58.420 --> 33:59.388
Don't be mad.

33:59.506 --> 34:01.732
The Phoenix Phantom snatched another girl.

34:02.075 --> 34:04.635
Devalos called. He asked me to stop by the crime scene.

34:04.779 --> 34:07.759
I've been waiting for you to get home. I have to stick my head in at the hospital.

34:07.857 --> 34:11.164
Say hi to Captain Push. Turns out they're operating on him tomorrow.

34:11.260 --> 34:12.969
I feel badly-- he's in a strange city.

34:13.376 --> 34:14.696
He doesn't know anybody.

34:15.525 --> 34:19.565
Marie's fever broke hours ago. She's out like a light.

34:20.917 --> 34:23.730
There's meat loaf in the oven. It'll be ready in 15 minutes.

34:23.815 --> 34:25.248
There's coleslaw in the fridge.

34:25.862 --> 34:29.371
So, if I leave right now I have a chance of getting back by 9:30.

34:30.880 --> 34:32.069
You still proud of me?

34:33.257 --> 34:34.818
Look what Daddy brought.

34:38.172 --> 34:40.543
Isn't Marie a little young for this?

34:40.742 --> 34:41.674
Get out of here.

34:42.092 --> 34:43.737
We'll have this fight at 9:30.

34:44.040 --> 34:44.996
You promise?

34:45.386 --> 34:47.505
I'm uncorking that at 9:15.

34:47.601 --> 34:49.277
Shall we synchronize our watches?

34:49.416 --> 34:50.301
Just go.

35:17.022 --> 35:17.826
Hey.

35:18.702 --> 35:19.450
Hey.

35:20.852 --> 35:22.584
How long you been sitting there?

35:24.221 --> 35:25.147
A bit.

35:27.400 --> 35:31.410
They told me they gave you a little something to help take the edge off.

35:31.952 --> 35:33.581
Is that what they call it,

35:34.343 --> 35:35.567
an edge?

35:38.133 --> 35:43.220
For what it's worth, apparently this is a fairly run-of-the-mill operation.

35:43.319 --> 35:45.106
It's not about my heart.

35:49.284 --> 35:51.660
I could have stopped this thing.

35:52.222 --> 35:53.365
You don't know that.

35:53.918 --> 35:57.537
Yeah, I do.

35:59.908 --> 36:02.837
Called Texas right after you and I got off the phone.

36:03.928 --> 36:06.142
Had them pull out the old lab work.

36:07.199 --> 36:09.299
It was there all along.

36:09.394 --> 36:10.947
Just never looked for it.

36:12.545 --> 36:13.901
You told me.

36:15.002 --> 36:16.855
You said, they're related--

36:17.813 --> 36:18.905
and they were.

36:19.681 --> 36:21.008
No, Captain Push.

36:21.478 --> 36:22.881
You told me.

36:25.581 --> 36:28.673
I can't remember the person's name.

36:31.464 --> 36:32.501
I've been thinking...

36:33.607 --> 36:35.574
I've been trying all day.

36:36.460 --> 36:37.683
The next victim.

36:38.836 --> 36:39.935
You told me I...

36:40.177 --> 36:41.651
I tried to tell you.

36:45.702 --> 36:47.114
What time is it?

36:47.831 --> 36:49.384
I lost all track of time.

36:49.839 --> 36:51.200
It's 10:15.

36:59.926 --> 37:01.210
He got her today.

37:03.838 --> 37:05.812
I just came from the crime scene.

37:07.406 --> 37:09.310
Her name was Sarah Duffy.

37:14.712 --> 37:15.849
I'm sorry.

37:18.202 --> 37:21.665
That... God...

37:22.996 --> 37:26.226
He is one perverse entity.

37:29.319 --> 37:32.888
First you die... then you see everything.

37:34.859 --> 37:36.800
I'm sorry, visiting hours are over.

37:37.291 --> 37:39.276
And you need your rest.

37:39.359 --> 37:42.401
You have a big day tomorrow. We're coming for you at 5:30.

37:42.821 --> 37:43.993
Duly noted.

37:45.530 --> 37:52.682
Oh, by the way... could you bring me a comb and a pair of nail clippers?

37:57.966 --> 38:00.515
I want you to do something for me.

38:01.878 --> 38:04.525
I want you to forget about all this.

38:06.000 --> 38:08.948
I want you to concentrate on getting better.

38:25.616 --> 38:28.865
I want to come by, check on you tomorrow.

38:29.341 --> 38:30.207
You'd better.

38:56.592 --> 38:57.972
Hey, it's me.

38:59.657 --> 39:00.701
I'm sorry I'm late.

39:03.509 --> 39:06.896
I would have called, but they don't allow cell phones in the cardio unit.

39:09.785 --> 39:10.507
So...

39:11.752 --> 39:13.153
how'd it go with the kids?

39:48.667 --> 39:49.414
Joe...

39:57.774 --> 39:59.352
Are you really asleep?

40:05.708 --> 40:06.782
I'm sorry.

40:52.728 --> 40:53.701
Hello.

40:53.947 --> 40:54.833
Allison...

40:55.897 --> 40:57.106
Captain Push.

40:58.226 --> 41:01.960
I just called to make sure you made it home.

41:03.665 --> 41:04.873
That you're safe.

41:06.522 --> 41:07.832
That you're in your bed.

41:09.657 --> 41:10.642
I'm home.

41:11.406 --> 41:13.865
I'm safe... in my bed.

41:15.083 --> 41:15.927
Good.

41:17.806 --> 41:18.763
Okay, then.

41:19.466 --> 41:21.064
Let's get some rest.

41:22.255 --> 41:24.114
And I'll see you soon, okay?

41:24.990 --> 41:27.253
Not if I don't see you first.

41:28.692 --> 41:29.537
Okay?

41:30.412 --> 41:31.640
Okay.

41:34.959 --> 41:35.732
Bye.
