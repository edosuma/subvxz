WEBVTT

02:26.813 --> 02:28.113
So.. 84?

02:28.115 --> 02:29.615
Uh, yeah.

02:29.617 --> 02:30.315
Already there.

02:30.317 --> 02:31.416
Hey guys!

02:31.418 --> 02:32.184
Hey kiddo.

02:32.186 --> 02:33.685
What's up, Al?

02:33.687 --> 02:35.654
Sure you can concentrate on
your homework in here, babe?

02:35.656 --> 02:36.288
Yeah.

02:36.290 --> 02:37.489
We helping d out.

02:37.491 --> 02:39.491
Me and your dad are
mathematical wizards.

02:39.493 --> 02:40.926
Oh really?

02:40.928 --> 02:41.827
I'll tell that to the debt
collectors when they come.

02:41.829 --> 02:43.128
Walt, where's my lighter?

02:43.130 --> 02:44.096
In your pocket.

02:44.098 --> 02:45.330
Aw, shit.

02:45.765 --> 02:47.299
Dad, come on.

02:47.301 --> 02:49.668
How many times do I have to
tell you to smoke in private,

02:49.670 --> 02:50.702
okay?

02:50.704 --> 02:51.637
It's medicinal.

02:51.639 --> 02:52.871
Guh...

02:54.641 --> 02:55.841
Smells good out here.

02:56.709 --> 02:57.910
Hey.

02:57.912 --> 03:01.046
So, I think we have a real good
chance of winning this thing.

03:01.048 --> 03:03.482
I haven't seen Maureen this
excited in a long time.

03:03.484 --> 03:04.683
Good for you, that's great.

03:05.451 --> 03:07.319
How's the parent-teacher
conference?

03:07.321 --> 03:09.401
Look, academically
he's fine, they just...

03:10.157 --> 03:11.857
They want him to
have more friends.

03:11.859 --> 03:13.625
He has friends.

03:13.627 --> 03:15.694
He has a friend, I mean I hate it
when they say stuff like that.

03:15.696 --> 03:17.329
Dakota is fine.

03:17.331 --> 03:19.464
Yeah, of course he's "fine,"
I'm just saying,

03:19.466 --> 03:21.400
have you paid this?
They want us...

03:21.402 --> 03:22.834
To encourage him
to have more friends.

03:22.836 --> 03:24.236
Yeah, I paid this.

03:24.238 --> 03:25.737
I just think it'd
be good for him.

03:25.739 --> 03:27.839
Not everybody needs to
have a ton of friends.

03:27.841 --> 03:29.241
I didn't.

03:29.243 --> 03:31.910
Well, next time there's a
parent-teacher conference,

03:31.912 --> 03:33.192
you can have it out with them.

03:35.481 --> 03:36.548
Hey Maureen.

03:37.850 --> 03:38.750
Yeah.

03:41.087 --> 03:42.327
Back in the day...

03:43.423 --> 03:45.390
When I was doing the show,

03:45.392 --> 03:47.159
we used to go down to xalapa,

03:47.161 --> 03:49.695
this beautiful little
fishing village.

03:49.697 --> 03:50.395
Really dad?

03:50.397 --> 03:52.164
Xalapa again?

03:53.399 --> 03:54.733
Heh, I love xalapa.

03:54.735 --> 03:57.255
Isn't that where you met
that sweet young thing?

03:57.938 --> 03:58.937
Stripper.

03:58.939 --> 03:59.905
Dad!
Yeah.

04:01.007 --> 04:02.287
What?

04:02.709 --> 04:04.009
I can't say the word "stripper?"

04:05.345 --> 04:07.746
I can't say "stripper"
in my own house?

04:07.748 --> 04:09.014
What, would you prefer peeler?

04:09.016 --> 04:10.048
George, eh...

04:10.050 --> 04:11.917
Don't forget you had
that audition

04:11.919 --> 04:14.759
audition? Tomorrow, so put
it in your phone, okay?

04:15.355 --> 04:16.288
What's the audition?
Play.

04:16.290 --> 04:17.623
It's a play.

04:17.625 --> 04:20.926
Uh, how do you, how do
you do that again, George?

04:20.928 --> 04:22.027
Lemme see the ring?
Here.

04:22.029 --> 04:23.028
Just put it in the calendar.

04:23.030 --> 04:24.263
O...

04:24.265 --> 04:25.764
How many times do I
have to show you this?

04:25.766 --> 04:28.367
Open up the calendar, the
calendar's right there, okay?

04:28.369 --> 04:29.134
Cool.

04:29.136 --> 04:31.069
Hit calendar, and then...

04:31.071 --> 04:32.351
I got it.

05:00.767 --> 05:02.887
<i>Right, and you talked</i>
<i>to her about that?</i>

05:03.436 --> 05:04.903
It's Tuesday so...

05:04.905 --> 05:07.406
Yeah, your blood pressure
and your cholesterol and your

05:07.408 --> 05:09.007
multivitamin.

05:09.009 --> 05:10.976
On the, in the top of yeah.
The week,

05:10.978 --> 05:12.110
you use them. Look, I left
him a message about that.

05:12.112 --> 05:13.178
He's going to call me tomorrow.

05:13.180 --> 05:14.780
You fill up the
days with the pills.

05:14.782 --> 05:16.248
Yeah but how, how will I know?

05:17.016 --> 05:18.317
Yeah.
I made you a list!

05:18.319 --> 05:19.618
Okay.
It's easy!

05:19.620 --> 05:20.686
Just, come on Roger,

05:20.688 --> 05:23.955
Roger. No, how will I know
what pill goes into what day.

05:23.957 --> 05:27.159
I, I don't need this I made you the
list, go put it on the fridge!

05:27.161 --> 05:28.360
Yes you...

05:28.362 --> 05:29.995
Just, it doesn't hurt to have it!
You got me covered!

05:29.997 --> 05:31.763
Are you kidding me?

05:31.765 --> 05:34.366
I shouldn't have to beg you to
take your fucking medicine Roger!

05:34.368 --> 05:37.536
Can I, can I call you back?
You're, you're not a baby!

05:37.538 --> 05:39.237
Okay. Okay, great. Thanks.

05:40.273 --> 05:42.174
Just take the
fucking list, okay?

05:42.176 --> 05:42.941
Sorry.

05:42.943 --> 05:44.223
Uh...

05:45.478 --> 05:48.547
Hey, why don't you and pop, uh,

05:48.549 --> 05:50.482
go ahead and get ready for bed.

05:50.484 --> 05:51.149
Alright?

05:51.151 --> 05:53.352
Sorry, George I'm...

06:04.530 --> 06:05.997
Sorry, I just made
a list for your dad.

06:05.999 --> 06:08.834
I can't, I can't
keep going over this.

06:08.836 --> 06:10.302
Can't keep going over this.

06:24.050 --> 06:25.450
What's going on?

06:33.693 --> 06:34.793
I...

06:35.895 --> 06:38.330
I can't, I can't be your
housewife anymore.

06:39.432 --> 06:41.066
What?

06:41.068 --> 06:42.834
How are you my housewife?

06:42.836 --> 06:45.670
I did the cooking and
the cleaning, and I...

06:46.572 --> 06:47.706
I go to pta meetings.

06:47.708 --> 06:49.274
And you paint, and
you surf, and...

06:49.276 --> 06:51.109
Not really, not anymore.

06:51.111 --> 06:52.411
Well, you could.

06:55.548 --> 06:56.515
I...

06:57.383 --> 06:58.717
I just need some...

06:58.719 --> 06:59.584
Time away.

06:59.586 --> 07:01.319
I, I've given up a lot for us.

07:03.122 --> 07:04.790
That's not fair, okay?

07:04.792 --> 07:06.458
That's not fair, and you...

07:07.460 --> 07:09.094
You're the one who said
he wanted me to go back to

07:09.096 --> 07:10.462
school, right?

07:10.464 --> 07:12.864
You're the one who said
he'd stay home with Dakota.

07:12.866 --> 07:15.867
It's not my fault If you
didn't paint, George, okay?

07:15.869 --> 07:17.235
So don't put that on me.

07:17.237 --> 07:19.538
I just don't feel like you,
you're around anymore,

07:19.540 --> 07:20.071
you know?

07:20.073 --> 07:21.306
I want to...

07:21.707 --> 07:23.707
I don't feel like
you're, you're, uh...

07:24.110 --> 07:25.844
I want to, you know, I want...

07:26.379 --> 07:29.548
I want some, I want to
do things too, you know?

07:29.550 --> 07:32.217
George, you can
paint, I mean y...

07:32.219 --> 07:33.718
You could do whatever you want.

07:33.720 --> 07:36.121
I'm not holding you
back from those things.

07:41.494 --> 07:43.061
I just need time away.

07:51.804 --> 07:53.738
So what, you're just leaving?

07:53.740 --> 07:54.573
You're just going to leave?

07:54.575 --> 07:55.656
Where are you gonna go?

07:58.611 --> 07:59.544
Um...

08:00.246 --> 08:00.912
I don't know.

08:00.914 --> 08:01.980
I'll figure it out.

08:09.689 --> 08:11.957
It's my dad's
party on Saturday.

08:11.959 --> 08:12.657
I got your stuff.

08:12.659 --> 08:14.125
It's in the fridge.

08:14.127 --> 08:16.261
Are you going to
come to the party?

08:16.263 --> 08:17.796
I don't know.

08:17.798 --> 08:20.265
Well who's going to grill
the steaks If you don't come?

08:25.972 --> 08:28.507
Are you fucking kidding me?

08:31.177 --> 08:32.443
Did you just hear yourself?

08:33.980 --> 08:36.214
Who's going to grill
the fucking steaks?

08:44.790 --> 08:46.830
Well what are you
going to say to Dakota?

08:54.534 --> 08:55.967
What are you doing up?

08:59.872 --> 09:01.640
Look at those stars, huh?

09:30.736 --> 09:32.571
Where does your dad
keep your lunch box?

09:32.573 --> 09:34.839
Mom, I don't use a
lunch box anymore.

09:35.741 --> 09:36.508
Oh.

09:37.343 --> 09:38.543
This coffee tastes like crap.

09:38.545 --> 09:39.744
That's 'cause I made it.

09:39.746 --> 09:41.346
Well George makes
the best coffee.

09:41.348 --> 09:42.080
Where's he?

09:42.082 --> 09:43.081
His mom is sick.

09:43.083 --> 09:44.249
What's wrong with his mom?

09:44.251 --> 09:45.850
No, he has an art show.

09:46.886 --> 09:48.320
Oh, he has an art show.

09:49.188 --> 09:50.055
Of course.

09:50.057 --> 09:50.922
Of course he has an art show.

09:50.924 --> 09:52.124
Where, where is the art show?

09:52.558 --> 09:53.692
Santa Fe.

09:56.129 --> 09:57.462
Santa Fe.

09:57.464 --> 09:58.363
Okay.

09:58.365 --> 10:00.098
Okay, um...

10:00.100 --> 10:02.300
Dad, dad, dad, dad, your pills?

10:02.302 --> 10:03.768
Okay, so It's Wednesday.

10:03.770 --> 10:05.136
Wednesday you have veratrol.

10:05.138 --> 10:06.137
Wednesday...

10:06.139 --> 10:06.905
Pink or blue.

10:06.907 --> 10:07.939
Which one?

10:07.941 --> 10:08.940
Figure it out later, okay?

10:08.942 --> 10:09.975
How am I going
to get to school?

10:09.977 --> 10:11.076
I'm going to drive you.

10:11.078 --> 10:12.998
We gotta go, we
gotta go, come on!

10:13.746 --> 10:14.547
Hey dad?

10:15.548 --> 10:17.048
You're picking up d
after school, okay?

10:17.050 --> 10:18.850
Well I got that audition.

10:20.219 --> 10:22.120
I'll get you right after, kid.

10:22.122 --> 10:23.321
Hey Maureen.

10:23.323 --> 10:24.656
<i>Vanessa told me you</i>
<i>were running late.</i>

10:24.658 --> 10:26.324
Yeah, I had a family emergency.

10:26.326 --> 10:27.392
<i>Well, I can't be there.</i>

10:27.394 --> 10:28.893
<i>I have a fundraising breakfast.</i>

10:28.895 --> 10:31.262
It's, It's going to be five
minutes, ten tops, and Josh

10:31.264 --> 10:31.997
can start for me.

10:31.999 --> 10:32.999
He knows the case.

10:33.600 --> 10:35.233
<i>Josh is not a lawyer.</i>

10:35.235 --> 10:37.002
I'm going to be there, I'm
just, I'm gonna,

10:37.004 --> 10:38.670
I am just gonna be there.

10:38.672 --> 10:39.638
<i>I'm counting on you, Alex.</i>

10:39.640 --> 10:40.438
Okay.

10:40.440 --> 10:41.406
All good.

10:42.908 --> 10:44.976
Okay, so grandpa's
going to pick you up.

10:46.112 --> 10:47.646
You know I love you, right?

10:48.247 --> 10:48.913
Yep.

10:48.915 --> 10:50.248
Okay.

10:50.250 --> 10:52.183
We're good!

10:52.185 --> 10:54.719
We are good, we are
good, we are good.

10:58.492 --> 11:00.692
Obviously we were stunned
to receive the petition.

11:00.694 --> 11:02.961
The city sold that land to
my client fair and square.

11:02.963 --> 11:05.797
With the promise of minimal
impact to the air quality and

11:05.799 --> 11:08.299
wildlife of a nature preserve.

11:08.301 --> 11:09.334
Mr. Williams...

11:09.336 --> 11:11.169
California's
already lost 98% of its

11:11.171 --> 11:12.370
wetlands.

11:12.372 --> 11:15.874
This tadpole exists in
the 2% that is left.

11:15.876 --> 11:19.110
All we're asking is that
Mr. Evans cease and Des...

11:19.112 --> 11:21.713
Uh, cease and desist
construction on his...

11:21.715 --> 11:22.614
Fuck it, you do it. Thank you.

11:22.616 --> 11:23.548
I...

11:24.617 --> 11:26.217
I am so, so, sorry.

11:26.219 --> 11:27.719
I'm so sorry, your honor.

11:27.721 --> 11:29.821
Your honor, when the district
sold my client that land, they

11:29.823 --> 11:32.157
understood the financial
rewards of the project.

11:32.159 --> 11:33.892
It'll bring millions of
dollars to a city that's

11:33.894 --> 11:35.126
basically bankrupt.

11:35.128 --> 11:36.561
That means jobs.

11:36.563 --> 11:39.631
Your honor, and again, I
apologize for being late, but

11:39.633 --> 11:42.701
when the city agreed to sell
Mr. Evans the land for a

11:42.703 --> 11:45.036
resort, he agreed to meet
certain environmental

11:45.038 --> 11:48.373
standards, and as you can see
from exhibit a, he's already

11:48.375 --> 11:50.008
in violation of
those standards.

11:50.010 --> 11:52.377
I have yet to see a
chain of custody report.

11:52.379 --> 11:55.647
When you destroy a species,
you pave the way for the

11:55.649 --> 11:56.748
destruction of the next.

11:56.750 --> 11:58.249
It's a domino effect.

11:58.251 --> 12:01.219
And all of these creatures
have valuable roles in our

12:01.221 --> 12:02.654
ecosystem.

12:02.656 --> 12:04.422
They regulate our air, our
water, our weather patterns...

12:04.424 --> 12:06.624
I'll hear your
case on June 25th.

12:07.560 --> 12:09.227
Your honor, that's not enough
time for us to build a fair

12:09.229 --> 12:10.195
case, um...

12:10.197 --> 12:12.497
Just take it and say thank you.

12:13.532 --> 12:14.766
Thank you your honor.

12:15.735 --> 12:16.601
Thank you your honor.

12:20.172 --> 12:21.005
Frank Evans.

12:21.007 --> 12:22.073
Alex Vetter.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.341
This is my colleagues
Josh Williams.

12:23.343 --> 12:24.509
Hey man, nice meeting you.

12:24.511 --> 12:26.010
Yeah.

12:26.012 --> 12:27.445
Well, thank you for bringing
the problem to my attention.

12:27.447 --> 12:29.247
I'll see what I can do.

12:29.249 --> 12:30.782
You can stop building your spa.

12:30.784 --> 12:31.716
Nah.

12:33.019 --> 12:34.452
I'm serious.

12:35.287 --> 12:37.455
I'm sure we can find
a great compromise.

12:38.624 --> 12:40.584
Okay, we've got a
lot of work to do.

13:17.229 --> 13:18.129
I bought it.

13:18.131 --> 13:18.930
I bought it.

13:18.932 --> 13:20.965
I, I bought it!

13:20.967 --> 13:22.267
I bought it!

13:22.269 --> 13:23.868

13:25.471 --> 13:27.539
W-wait, please!

13:30.643 --> 13:32.143
Director's kind of a dick.

13:38.117 --> 13:40.185
You look familiar.

13:40.653 --> 13:41.352
Oh,

television show

13:46.193 --> 13:47.125
Oh yeah?

13:47.127 --> 13:48.126
Yeah.

13:48.128 --> 13:49.093
That must be it.

13:49.795 --> 13:51.529
You know this is
Chekhov, right?

13:51.531 --> 13:52.297
Yeah.

13:52.299 --> 13:52.931
Yeah.

13:52.933 --> 13:53.765
Yeah.

13:53.767 --> 13:55.066

the theater and, and uh, so,

14:00.307 --> 14:03.441

the theater and stuff.

14:03.443 --> 14:04.609
Great.
Yeah.

14:04.611 --> 14:06.778
Great, well, um, thanks

14:06.780 --> 14:08.947

a look at the first scene.

14:08.949 --> 14:10.315
Okay.
And um,

14:10.317 --> 14:12.350

14:38.511 --> 14:40.812
W-wait, wait, ladies and
gentlemen, please don't go

14:40.814 --> 14:41.813

14:41.815 --> 14:44.482
I, I am a little dazed.

14:44.484 --> 14:46.517
I'm confused, I, I...

14:46.519 --> 14:47.518
I'm going to stop
you right there.

14:47.520 --> 14:49.420
It's great, It's
really really great.

14:49.422 --> 14:52.457
Would you, would you mind
taking a look at another part?

14:54.360 --> 14:55.526
Um, sure.

14:55.528 --> 14:56.028
It's okay?

14:56.029 --> 14:57.495
Yeah.

14:57.497 --> 14:59.097
Um, would you mind taking
a look at the part of firs?

14:59.099 --> 15:00.164
It's the servant.

15:00.699 --> 15:02.100
The really old one?

15:02.102 --> 15:03.735
Yeah.

15:05.838 --> 15:07.071
Okay.

15:07.073 --> 15:08.306
Sure.

15:10.442 --> 15:12.110
What's up with you?

15:12.112 --> 15:13.111
You seem off.

15:14.247 --> 15:15.546
Oh, I'm sorry, no.

15:15.548 --> 15:17.415
I'm, I'm, I'm
totally fine, I...

15:17.417 --> 15:18.116
Everything's okay?

15:18.118 --> 15:18.850
Everything's good.

15:18.852 --> 15:20.285
I have a small...

15:20.287 --> 15:23.254
Just a blip of a thing
happening at home, but It's...

15:23.256 --> 15:24.956
But you're up for this?

15:24.958 --> 15:27.679
I need you to be I'm...
Up for this.

15:28.360 --> 15:30.261
If you're not, just tell me.

15:30.263 --> 15:31.262
I'll get someone else.

15:31.264 --> 15:32.096
<i>Earth now.</i>

15:32.765 --> 15:33.932
No, I'm up for this.

15:33.934 --> 15:35.400
Don't bullshit me.

15:35.402 --> 15:37.302
<i>Alex, Dakota's</i>
<i>school, line one.</i>

15:39.438 --> 15:40.471
Um...

15:40.473 --> 15:41.406

15:41.408 --> 15:43.341

just the, okay.

15:46.545 --> 15:47.578
Hello?

15:47.580 --> 15:49.047
I am so, so sorry.

15:49.049 --> 15:50.548
I don't know what happened.

15:50.550 --> 15:52.650
M-my husband's out of town
and I asked my dad to come and

15:52.652 --> 15:54.052
pick him up, and I
can't get a hold of him.

15:54.054 --> 15:55.053
I'm...

15:55.055 --> 15:56.321
Please, don't worry.
I'm so sorry.

15:56.323 --> 15:57.488
Everything's fine.

15:57.490 --> 15:59.257
Dakota's fine, that's
what's important.

15:59.259 --> 16:01.092
And it gives us the
opportunity to check in with

16:01.094 --> 16:03.928
each other since we missed
you at parents' night.

16:03.930 --> 16:05.630
Right, well I had
to work, so...

16:05.632 --> 16:08.499
Did your husband mention that
I talked to him about your

16:08.501 --> 16:11.269
encouraging Dakota to reach
out to some of the other

16:11.271 --> 16:12.437
students?

16:12.439 --> 16:14.005
Right.

16:14.007 --> 16:16.741
Yeah, he did mention it and,
and we're working on it.

16:16.743 --> 16:18.743
Oh, that's great.

16:19.611 --> 16:20.745
Such a sweet boy.
Well,

16:20.747 --> 16:22.447
yeah, so um, um,
I should get him home.

16:22.449 --> 16:23.281
But thank you so much.

16:23.283 --> 16:24.482
Okay.
Okay.

16:24.484 --> 16:25.583
Bye.
Bye.

16:25.585 --> 16:27.418
Don't be a stranger.

16:32.324 --> 16:33.157
Alright.

16:34.026 --> 16:35.159
What happened?

16:35.928 --> 16:37.028
What do you mean?

16:37.030 --> 16:38.696
You were supposed to pick
up Dakota after school.

16:38.698 --> 16:39.497
You don't remember?

16:39.499 --> 16:40.164
You don't remember that?

16:40.166 --> 16:42.533
Oh, shit.

16:43.268 --> 16:44.602
What, you just forgot?

16:44.604 --> 16:45.470
Is that what happened?

16:45.472 --> 16:47.205
You just forgot?

16:47.207 --> 16:48.206
W...

16:48.208 --> 16:49.474
You should've put
it in my phone!

16:49.476 --> 16:50.274
I shouldn't have done anything!

16:50.276 --> 16:51.809
I need it in the phone!

16:51.811 --> 16:53.945
I asked you to pick him up,
and that's all I should've had

16:53.947 --> 16:56.147
Oh, no no no. No. To do, and you're smoking
and you're not thinking and you're

16:56.149 --> 16:58.116
Oh no. Hold on, hold on. Not
remembering a word that I say!

16:58.118 --> 17:02.453
George always puts it in
the phone so I don't forget.

17:02.455 --> 17:03.888
This is exhausting.

17:03.890 --> 17:05.123
I'm sorry kid.

17:05.125 --> 17:08.326
It's fine, grandpa. Grandpa wouldn't
have left you hanging like that.

17:08.328 --> 17:09.627
It wasn't in my phone! Grandpa.

17:09.628 --> 17:11.095
Party's here.

17:13.898 --> 17:15.199
Oh my God.

17:15.201 --> 17:15.900
See?

17:15.902 --> 17:17.001
Oh my God, lily!

17:17.002 --> 17:18.403
I was bringing in your sister.

17:18.405 --> 17:19.404
Hey!

17:19.406 --> 17:21.439
I was trying to
do something good.

17:21.973 --> 17:24.509
No, dad, it was
so good, so good.

17:24.511 --> 17:26.511
But, you know, If you say
you're going to pick up

17:26.512 --> 17:28.646
Dakota, you have
to pick up Dakota.

17:28.648 --> 17:29.480
I'm so sorry, boo.

17:29.482 --> 17:31.215
Daddy told me what happened.

17:31.217 --> 17:32.083
Men are such dicks.

17:32.085 --> 17:32.717
All of them.

17:32.719 --> 17:33.818
Shh, so, shh.

17:33.820 --> 17:36.054
No, Dakota, what
happened to him?

17:36.056 --> 17:37.688
You're fucking gi-normous.

17:37.690 --> 17:39.857
You look like a
grown man, come here!

17:39.859 --> 17:42.827
Give me a hug, Oh my God,
what the fuck happened to him?

17:42.829 --> 17:44.262
Two years happened.

17:44.264 --> 17:47.365
You, you already had your
first kiss I bet, huh?

17:47.367 --> 17:49.067
Okay, well, he's only
ten, so let's just...

17:49.069 --> 17:49.867
Oh, fuck, I'm so...

17:49.869 --> 17:50.701
The language.

17:50.703 --> 17:52.203
I'm sorry.
It's okay.

17:52.205 --> 17:53.037
Sorry...

17:53.039 --> 17:54.079
Good to see you!

17:55.241 --> 17:57.608
Oh, It's good to see you!

17:58.510 --> 17:59.911
She looks good, huh?

18:00.779 --> 18:03.060
I think your butt
got a little bigger.

18:03.682 --> 18:05.283
How can you say that to me?

18:05.285 --> 18:07.452
You're my daughter, I
can say whatever I want!

18:07.454 --> 18:08.286
No!

18:08.288 --> 18:08.886
Yeah!

18:08.888 --> 18:09.454
No!

18:09.456 --> 18:10.736
Yeah!

18:12.624 --> 18:15.359
So dad Says you're working
on becoming a masseuse.

18:15.361 --> 18:17.628
Oh, no, not anymore.

18:17.630 --> 18:19.230
Eh, I had this client.

18:19.232 --> 18:21.065
I think he thought I was like
a different kind of masseuse.

18:21.067 --> 18:21.866
Shit!

18:21.868 --> 18:23.548
Really?
Yeah.

18:24.070 --> 18:25.103
But you know what?

18:25.105 --> 18:26.737
My line is totally
coming together.

18:26.739 --> 18:28.940
I have an investor all lined
up and they're just waiting on

18:28.942 --> 18:31.375
me, so It's going to be so
great to be here, 'cause I can

18:31.377 --> 18:34.312
focus on my designs and
draw every day and...

18:34.314 --> 18:36.280
Speaking of which, did you
ever wear that dress that I

18:36.282 --> 18:37.381
sent you for Christmas?

18:37.383 --> 18:38.649
Yeah.

18:38.651 --> 18:40.218
Ah, did you look so money?

18:40.220 --> 18:41.786
I looked so money.

18:43.422 --> 18:45.623
Alex, this is really
fucking weird.

18:45.625 --> 18:46.624
What?

18:46.626 --> 18:47.959
That you sleep
in their bedroom.

18:47.961 --> 18:50.461
It's not that weird, I just,
it made the most sense.

18:51.296 --> 18:53.537
So, what's happening
with Dakota?

18:54.166 --> 18:55.766
What do you mean?

18:55.768 --> 18:59.570
I mean, have you told him that
his dad is a fucking asshole?

18:59.572 --> 19:02.306
I'm not going to make Dakota
upset when we're just going to

19:02.308 --> 19:03.474
get back together.

19:03.476 --> 19:04.275
You know what?

19:04.277 --> 19:05.610
You keep shit from kids...

19:05.612 --> 19:07.278
He's ten.

19:07.280 --> 19:08.713
They get all fucked up.

19:10.415 --> 19:13.985
Thanks, lily, but I can
handle my own ten year-old.

19:13.987 --> 19:15.253
I know that.

19:15.255 --> 19:16.487
I, I wasn't saying you
weren't a good mom...

19:16.489 --> 19:18.169
No, I know you weren't,
I know you weren't.

19:18.757 --> 19:22.260
I am behind at work,
so, I'm gonna...

19:22.262 --> 19:23.661
Get to bed.

19:23.663 --> 19:25.163
Okay.
Okay.

19:25.165 --> 19:26.531
Where are you gonna sleep?

19:28.333 --> 19:29.613
It's gonna be like old times.

19:30.936 --> 19:32.216
Mm, yeah.

19:40.712 --> 19:41.992
Hey, Lee.

19:42.948 --> 19:44.228

19:45.684 --> 19:46.964
Okay.

19:50.322 --> 19:51.602
Right.

19:53.625 --> 19:55.026
Well that's...

19:55.028 --> 19:56.308
Perfect.

19:57.396 --> 19:58.676
That's great.

20:00.065 --> 20:01.632
Yeah o-, okay!

That, I'm, firs is the
greatest part there is.

20:15.348 --> 20:16.881

20:16.883 --> 20:18.716
You said that you were going
to be here today, so If you're

20:18.718 --> 20:21.219
not coming, can you just
let me know either way?

20:21.221 --> 20:22.320
Alright?

20:22.322 --> 20:23.187
Okay, thanks.

20:23.189 --> 20:24.055
Do you need help with those?

20:24.057 --> 20:25.089
What, you know how to do this?

20:25.091 --> 20:26.724
No, but I'll figure it out.

20:31.163 --> 20:32.443
Should you be drinking that?

20:33.398 --> 20:34.031
It's just beer.

20:34.033 --> 20:35.313
It's like water.

20:44.576 --> 20:45.856
Hey dad.

20:46.845 --> 20:49.165
Hope you're having a good trip.

20:50.415 --> 20:51.695
Miss you.

20:54.253 --> 20:56.653
When you get back, I
have a surprise for you.

20:57.256 --> 20:59.816
Not going to tell you
what it is right now.

21:00.525 --> 21:01.926
You have to see it...

text me back?

21:33.626 --> 21:36.093

22:04.089 --> 22:05.623
New York is a crazy place.

22:05.625 --> 22:07.858
I used to take the subway all
the time, but then last month,

22:07.860 --> 22:10.027
I was waiting for the train,
and I'm sitting next to this

22:10.029 --> 22:12.763
cute little old rasta man,
and I thought "Oh, what a cute

22:12.765 --> 22:14.098
little old man!"

22:14.100 --> 22:16.701
Then I looked down and I
realized he was jerking off.

22:16.703 --> 22:18.336
I'm back to cabs.

22:18.338 --> 22:19.537
I'm late for work!

22:19.539 --> 22:20.705
It's Sunday.

22:20.707 --> 22:22.640
She always works on Sundays.

22:22.642 --> 22:24.975
Yeah, when dad wakes up,
make sure he takes his meds.

22:24.977 --> 22:26.844
The list is on
the fridge, okay?

22:26.846 --> 22:28.713
And can you walk Friday?

22:28.715 --> 22:29.447
Got it.
Okay.

22:29.449 --> 22:30.729
I love you.

22:49.201 --> 22:51.482
The waterfall. Look at the
colors he has in the waterfall.

22:51.737 --> 22:55.005
Blue and green. So cool. Right?

22:55.007 --> 22:56.307
Hey Billy.

22:56.309 --> 22:57.475
Hey Al, what's going on?

22:57.477 --> 22:58.709
Have you seen George around?

22:59.411 --> 23:00.711
No, I haven't seen him.

23:01.546 --> 23:02.513
Okay.

23:02.515 --> 23:03.481
Thanks.

23:03.483 --> 23:04.715
Everything alright?

23:04.717 --> 23:05.816
Yeah.

23:05.818 --> 23:07.084
Yeah, everything's fine.
Thank you.

23:07.086 --> 23:07.918
Okay.

23:07.920 --> 23:09.420
Take care.

23:09.422 --> 23:10.302
We'll see ya.

23:18.196 --> 23:20.398

24:19.758 --> 24:21.225
You don't have to say that.

24:21.227 --> 24:23.561
I'm being serious.

24:23.563 --> 24:24.995
Thank you.

24:26.132 --> 24:27.465
Who's the hottie?

24:28.133 --> 24:31.569
Come on, who is she?

24:32.604 --> 24:34.872
What? You have such a crush.

24:35.974 --> 24:37.408
Yes you do.

24:38.109 --> 24:39.643
What's her name?

24:39.645 --> 24:40.778
Rain.

24:40.780 --> 24:42.246
Oh, rain.

24:42.248 --> 24:43.681
Do you like her?

24:44.816 --> 24:46.417
You should show her these.

24:47.786 --> 24:50.187
If a guy drew me
like this, forget it.

24:50.189 --> 24:51.755
Forget it!

24:56.094 --> 24:57.428
Okay, okay.

24:57.430 --> 25:00.030
Madam will have
her coffee here.

25:02.334 --> 25:04.635
Where's the cream...
Where's the cream?

25:04.637 --> 25:07.037
Well It's, in here it Says
"is the coffee ready."

25:07.039 --> 25:07.838
I don't know If...
Oh, Oh!

25:07.840 --> 25:08.806
Yeah.

25:08.808 --> 25:09.707
F-first you say
"is the coffee..."

25:09.709 --> 25:11.008
Um, um...

25:11.010 --> 25:13.143
Madam will have
her coffee here.

25:13.145 --> 25:13.911
Can I just...

25:14.713 --> 25:15.846
Ask you something?

25:15.848 --> 25:16.947
Um...

25:18.717 --> 25:20.618
When you called lily...

25:22.020 --> 25:24.288
To come, I mean why
did you do that?

25:24.290 --> 25:25.456
Um...

25:26.358 --> 25:27.958
You know, I thought it'd be...

25:29.361 --> 25:32.062
You know, nice to get
the family together.

25:32.064 --> 25:33.731
I always like that.

25:34.466 --> 25:37.234
Is that the only reason, or...

25:43.575 --> 25:44.875
'Cause I'm trying.

25:46.244 --> 25:47.878
I, um...

25:51.850 --> 25:55.819
You just got a lot
going on, Alex.

25:59.024 --> 26:01.425
But, you know, It's
your, It's your job.

26:01.427 --> 26:04.028
I mean, I, I understand.

26:04.030 --> 26:05.329
I...

26:05.331 --> 26:06.964
I understand.

26:07.933 --> 26:10.234
You've always been that way.

26:11.403 --> 26:13.437
E-even in school
you were ambitious.

26:14.840 --> 26:18.742
You'd get your work done a-a
month in advance, and, you

26:18.744 --> 26:22.613
know, and be asking
for more and, and um...

26:24.015 --> 26:25.349
Is that a good thing?

26:26.752 --> 26:28.285
I don't know where you got it!

26:36.928 --> 26:38.796
I don't know If
It's a good thing.

26:41.199 --> 26:45.135
Well, You'll figure it out.

26:46.571 --> 26:47.805
You always do.

29:05.176 --> 29:07.711
Hey Al, come here,
check this out.

29:07.713 --> 29:09.046
Hey Josh, let me
get a shot of that.

29:09.048 --> 29:10.681
You find something?

29:10.683 --> 29:11.949
Great, thanks.

29:11.951 --> 29:13.250
So uh,

29:13.252 --> 29:16.587
unfortunately our tadpoles
aren't doing that well.

29:16.589 --> 29:19.556
Normally the wetlands water
would be relatively clear.

29:19.558 --> 29:22.459
You can definitely see that's
got a metallic color, like,

29:22.461 --> 29:23.560
rust color.

29:23.562 --> 29:25.843
Mhmm.
It's just not right.

29:33.037 --> 29:34.238
Josh?

29:34.240 --> 29:35.939
When can you get yeah?
Me those numbers?

29:35.941 --> 29:38.375
Um, I can get them
to you later tonight.

29:38.377 --> 29:39.576
Okay.

29:39.578 --> 29:40.644
As soon as you have
the results, call me.

29:40.646 --> 29:41.578
I don't give a fuck
what time it is.

29:41.580 --> 29:42.246
Alright.
Alex?

29:42.248 --> 29:42.880
Yeah?

29:42.882 --> 29:45.048
We're going to discuss the best
way to present.

29:45.050 --> 29:45.816
Great.

29:45.818 --> 29:47.484
Everybody's on call tonight.

29:47.486 --> 29:49.286
Okay.
This is big.

29:49.288 --> 29:50.254
Good work everyone.

29:50.256 --> 29:51.388
Yeah.

29:52.090 --> 29:53.157
Good night!

29:54.993 --> 29:56.660
I mean.
Okay.

29:56.662 --> 29:58.128
Really. The pepper is the
main attraction here!

29:58.130 --> 30:00.164
This was so good, lily.

30:00.166 --> 30:01.665
It's just spaghetti.

30:01.667 --> 30:03.333
Could've used a
little more sauce.

30:03.335 --> 30:04.301
Little bit.

30:04.303 --> 30:05.669
Well we don't have any more!

30:06.272 --> 30:07.304
Okay?

30:07.306 --> 30:09.147
What's the play about, grandpa?

30:09.574 --> 30:14.745
Um, It's about an, an old
servant who, uh, has been

30:14.747 --> 30:16.780
working for this
family forever.

30:16.782 --> 30:20.284
And the family is broke and
uh, they have this cherry

30:20.286 --> 30:26.657
orchard, and this kind of dumb
young guy uh, chops down the

30:26.659 --> 30:30.360
cherry trees and puts
up condos or some shit.

30:30.362 --> 30:35.432
And then they all leave the
house and forget about me, and

30:35.434 --> 30:40.671
I'm left there alone and
um, then I guess I die.

30:43.007 --> 30:44.608
It's ambiguous.

30:45.276 --> 30:46.109
Oh my God.

30:46.111 --> 30:47.511
That's so depressing.

30:47.513 --> 30:49.112
I don't want to see that.

30:49.849 --> 30:50.714
Uh-uh.

30:50.716 --> 30:52.382
No, It's Chekhov!

30:53.551 --> 30:54.852
Sounds whack.

30:55.453 --> 30:56.854
Are you hearing this Walt?

30:56.856 --> 30:58.622
You know, just...

30:58.624 --> 31:00.057
What?

31:00.059 --> 31:02.526
Why are you always taking a
poop on everyone's parade?

31:02.528 --> 31:03.627
Big poop.
She's just being realistic.

31:03.629 --> 31:05.963
I do not poop on
anybody's anything!

31:05.965 --> 31:07.798
Fine dad, you know what?

31:07.800 --> 31:10.033
I bet this is going to be a
huge game changer for you.

31:10.035 --> 31:12.502
Oh now, now you
hear this Roger?

31:12.504 --> 31:13.470
A game changer.

31:13.472 --> 31:14.238
They're making fun of me.

31:14.240 --> 31:15.205
Mhmm.

31:15.207 --> 31:15.839
Flip flopper.
No we're not, dad.

31:15.841 --> 31:16.974
Of course you are.

31:16.976 --> 31:17.975
Ganging up on me.

31:17.977 --> 31:19.076
Mom...
Always have.

31:19.078 --> 31:20.244
We don't gang up on you!
We are not, dad!

31:20.246 --> 31:21.044
Gang banger.

31:21.046 --> 31:22.179
Mom!

31:22.181 --> 31:23.847
Yeah babe?
I think the oven's on fire.

31:23.849 --> 31:25.349
Fuck, the chocolate
chip cookies!

31:25.351 --> 31:26.183
Oh shit.

31:26.185 --> 31:27.351
Okay, It's fine.
Okay, okay

31:27.353 --> 31:29.653
everyone just calm down,
this is really

31:29.655 --> 31:31.088
Oh my God!
Whoa, Whoa

31:31.090 --> 31:32.155
my God.

31:32.157 --> 31:35.559
Yeah, I'll do this one.

31:35.561 --> 31:36.760
Come here.
Uh...

31:36.762 --> 31:38.228
Where does your dad keep
the fire extinguisher?

31:38.230 --> 31:41.665
Be cool, everybody be cool! We have
one in the house somewhere don't we?

31:41.667 --> 31:43.787
I have no idea!
Well I thought...

31:44.203 --> 31:45.602
Be cool!

31:45.604 --> 31:46.703
<i>What's the status on the cookies?
</i> Alright...

31:46.705 --> 31:47.070
Shit!

31:47.072 --> 31:48.038
Oh!

31:48.040 --> 31:49.106
Are you okay mom?

31:49.108 --> 31:50.274
You okay Alex?
I'm fine, I'm fine, no.

31:50.276 --> 31:51.108
Are you okay, mom?

31:51.110 --> 31:52.709
Sweetie, I'm fine, I'm fine.

31:52.711 --> 31:54.211
I'm good.

31:54.213 --> 31:56.079
Are we going to
have cookies or not?

31:57.015 --> 31:58.882
Wow, what a question dad!

31:58.884 --> 32:00.617
Dad, If you didn't notice,
the house is burning down.

32:00.619 --> 32:01.685
Yeah.

32:02.721 --> 32:04.755
The house is not
fucking burning down.

32:04.757 --> 32:06.823
I'm just, I'd like a cookie.

32:07.392 --> 32:09.293
Okay, what do we ask it next?

32:10.194 --> 32:13.096
Ask this board something
you wouldn't know.

32:13.698 --> 32:14.631
Alright.

32:14.633 --> 32:16.833
Am I ever going
to have sex again?

32:18.469 --> 32:21.271
Okay, first of all, what?

32:21.273 --> 32:25.309
I-I can tell you right
now the answer is yes.

32:25.311 --> 32:27.144
Well, I mean I've...

32:29.747 --> 32:32.382
I've only ever had
sex with George, so...

32:33.251 --> 32:33.951
What?

32:36.421 --> 32:37.554
Are you serious?

32:37.556 --> 32:38.889
I got pregnant when
I was 19, lily.

32:38.891 --> 32:40.090
Okay, that...

32:40.092 --> 32:41.893
That's like the saddest
thing I've ever heard.

32:43.061 --> 32:43.994
Okay, you know what?

32:43.996 --> 32:45.276
You're going to
have sex tonight.

32:46.264 --> 32:47.164
With who?

32:47.166 --> 32:49.032
We're going to find somebody.

32:50.101 --> 32:52.102
I'm not going to have
sex with a stranger,

32:52.104 --> 32:53.103
If that's what you're why...
Talking about.

32:53.105 --> 32:53.937
Why not?

32:53.939 --> 32:55.806
Because there are diseases!

32:55.808 --> 32:58.141
Uh, there's also condoms.

32:58.977 --> 33:00.310
Ugh...

33:03.581 --> 33:06.783
Okay, okay, so there's, there's
a guy at work, but It's not...

33:06.785 --> 33:07.484
Okay, great.

33:07.486 --> 33:08.652
Let's text him.

33:10.621 --> 33:11.655
What do I say?

33:11.657 --> 33:12.823
I don't want to text him.

33:12.825 --> 33:15.092
Just ask him If he
wants to get a drink.

33:16.260 --> 33:17.127
A drink.

33:17.129 --> 33:18.862
What, like, a drink where?

33:18.864 --> 33:19.796
Like...

33:19.798 --> 33:20.831
What?

33:20.833 --> 33:23.000
Who cares just be
like, "hey, what up?

33:23.002 --> 33:24.334
Do you want to get a drink?"

33:24.336 --> 33:25.936
Hey...

33:25.938 --> 33:26.803
Josh...

33:26.805 --> 33:27.671
How are you?

33:27.673 --> 33:28.305
No!

33:28.307 --> 33:28.972
What? Y...

33:28.974 --> 33:29.806
"How are you?"

33:29.808 --> 33:30.974
No!

33:30.976 --> 33:33.010
It's, I need like no.
An introduction.

33:33.012 --> 33:33.893
No, we're not writing
like a letter from camp.

33:33.919 --> 33:34.511
I'm not just going to be like...

33:34.513 --> 33:35.679
Just say like,

33:35.681 --> 33:37.481
"hey, I'm really into anal..."

33:41.320 --> 33:43.220
Do you want to get a drink?

33:44.655 --> 33:45.956
Just be like "hey, what's up?

33:45.958 --> 33:47.557
You look like you have like
a mushroom dick and I

33:47.559 --> 33:50.027
want to sit on it."

33:53.297 --> 33:54.331
Just be like "hey, what's up?

33:54.333 --> 33:55.332
I've only had sex
with one person.

33:55.334 --> 33:56.500
My pussy's tight."

33:56.502 --> 33:58.468
Just fucking write it!

33:58.470 --> 33:59.803
Give it to me. Give it to me.

33:59.805 --> 34:01.371
Don't write it!

34:01.373 --> 34:02.572
Give it to me! No, you're going
to write something horrible.

34:02.574 --> 34:04.341
No! Oh, give it to me.

34:04.343 --> 34:05.675

Lily, please don't.

34:18.424 --> 34:19.489
Please don't,

34:19.491 --> 34:20.857
Oh my God, It's done!

34:20.859 --> 34:21.858
Oh my God, this is so exciting.
What did you say?

34:21.860 --> 34:22.391
I know exactly
what You'll wear...

34:22.927 --> 34:23.659
What did you say?

34:23.661 --> 34:24.828
Please, lily...

34:24.830 --> 34:25.550
I...

34:26.364 --> 34:28.264
Oh, he already texted back.

34:28.266 --> 34:29.565
He said sure.

34:31.936 --> 34:35.205
Does this mean I just
arranged to have sex with him?

34:35.206 --> 34:36.739
No.

34:36.742 --> 34:37.507
You know what?

34:37.509 --> 34:38.675
I have this dress.

34:38.677 --> 34:40.677
It's like a magical dress.

34:41.846 --> 34:42.927
I'm going to go get it.

34:43.947 --> 34:45.348
You should wear it tonight.

35:05.803 --> 35:09.306
Okay, this dress,
no underwear...

35:09.807 --> 35:10.647
You're set!

35:11.375 --> 35:12.742
Y-don't, It's...

35:12.744 --> 35:13.810
Easy access.

35:13.812 --> 35:15.745
Oh, great.

35:15.747 --> 35:17.214
That's what I'm looking for.

35:17.216 --> 35:18.915
Maybe that's what you need?

35:18.917 --> 35:20.150
Come on, go try this on.

35:20.152 --> 35:20.951
No.

35:21.552 --> 35:22.652
I can't.

35:24.489 --> 35:26.123
Yeah, I'm just not ready.

35:32.797 --> 35:35.132
Madam will take her coffee now.

35:37.401 --> 35:39.136
Madam will take...

35:40.238 --> 35:42.439
Where's the cream?

35:42.441 --> 35:43.840
Where's the...

35:57.922 --> 36:00.457
I can't, I can't,
I can't, I can't.

36:00.459 --> 36:02.192
I can't do this.

36:02.194 --> 36:04.361
I can't do this play.

36:04.363 --> 36:05.762
What do you mean
you can't do it?

36:05.764 --> 36:08.131
I can't do this fucking play.

36:08.133 --> 36:09.666
Of course you can.

36:09.668 --> 36:11.968
I-It's not sticking.

36:11.970 --> 36:12.869
The, the...

36:13.638 --> 36:16.206
I can't, I don't see the...

36:16.208 --> 36:17.207
The words.

36:17.209 --> 36:19.843
They're not staying in my head.

36:19.845 --> 36:21.378
I...

36:22.780 --> 36:24.381
You're doing the fucking play.

36:24.383 --> 36:25.148
No.

36:25.150 --> 36:26.383
Yes you are.

36:26.385 --> 36:28.185
You gonna do the play.

36:28.187 --> 36:29.819
There's no question about it.

36:29.821 --> 36:31.741
And you're going
to be brilliant.

36:36.894 --> 36:39.829
The scientist from the Tahoe

36:39.831 --> 36:42.365
case saw the ph numbers and
s-Says he'll fly

36:42.367 --> 36:43.567
himself in to testify.

36:43.569 --> 36:44.668
Oh, that's good news.

36:44.670 --> 36:46.430
Right?
Yeah.

36:47.572 --> 36:49.973
Wait, h-however, he also Says
the numbers aren't quite high

36:49.975 --> 36:51.708
enough and they're going
to claim

36:51.710 --> 36:52.876
okay guys, I'll see you tomorrow.
Quick uptaking...

36:52.878 --> 36:54.044
See ya.

36:54.046 --> 36:54.967
Okay.

36:56.314 --> 36:59.182
He Says that they're going to
claim "uptaking pollution is

36:59.184 --> 37:02.419
due to nearby refineries
and weather patterns."

37:02.421 --> 37:04.054
That's bullshit.

37:08.526 --> 37:11.461
Well, the dead
tadpoles will help.

37:12.563 --> 37:14.097
I mean If...

37:14.099 --> 37:15.365
If more die, That'll...

37:15.367 --> 37:16.600
That'll help.

37:18.102 --> 37:20.503
I hate that I have to hope for
the death of tadpoles in order

37:20.505 --> 37:23.173
to prevent the
death of tadpoles.

37:28.246 --> 37:30.347
Hey what did, what did you
want last night when you,

37:30.349 --> 37:31.815
when you texted me?

37:33.517 --> 37:35.452
Oh, um...

37:35.454 --> 37:36.620
I uh...

37:38.022 --> 37:40.190
I was just thinking
about the case and um...

37:43.094 --> 37:44.261
Yeah.

37:44.263 --> 37:45.562
Just something, something
to do with that.

37:45.564 --> 37:46.997
Oh.

37:48.199 --> 37:49.432
Okay.

37:54.805 --> 37:56.206
Hey, you know?

37:56.208 --> 37:58.541
Do you want to just take
this back to my place and...

37:58.543 --> 38:01.544
I don't know, work with a bottle
of wine or something? Or...

38:05.249 --> 38:06.616
Yeah, yeah.

38:06.618 --> 38:08.184
We could do that.

38:13.291 --> 38:14.557
Yeah, like now?

38:14.559 --> 38:15.425
Yeah.

38:15.427 --> 38:17.327
I-I mean, I, yeah, sure. Sure.

38:38.749 --> 38:39.683
W-when you think
of elephants...

38:39.685 --> 38:40.483
Mhmm?

38:40.485 --> 38:42.152
Y-you don't, I don't know.

38:42.154 --> 38:45.622
You think of
innocence and, um...

38:45.624 --> 38:47.123
I dunno, elephants,

38:47.125 --> 38:48.625
alright?

38:48.627 --> 38:50.026
Like, they remember
stuff I guess?

38:50.028 --> 38:50.660
Mm.

38:50.662 --> 38:52.195
Mm, yeah.
Um...

38:52.197 --> 38:53.530
But this thing, it was like,
they're a lot like, they're a

38:53.532 --> 38:55.065
lot like us.

38:55.700 --> 38:59.636
Like they, they
crave, um, contact.

38:59.638 --> 39:01.604
Mm, right.
Like physical contact.

39:01.606 --> 39:02.806
With each other. They like,

39:02.808 --> 39:04.941
roll around.

39:04.943 --> 39:06.343
On each other.

39:06.345 --> 39:07.777
Elephants.

39:07.779 --> 39:11.214
Oh yeah. These big, thick-skinned
creatures are just...

39:11.216 --> 39:12.849
And their, their trunks...

39:13.551 --> 39:15.618
They'll l-like, you know,
intertwine their trunks

39:15.620 --> 39:16.586
and like...

39:17.488 --> 39:19.189
You know, It's like, um...

39:20.458 --> 39:21.291
It was...

39:21.293 --> 39:24.127
What I, it was oddly sexual.

39:24.129 --> 39:25.495
Really?
Like on their part.

39:25.497 --> 39:26.896
Yeah.

39:26.898 --> 39:28.164
Wow.
Um...

39:28.166 --> 39:31.401
But it was like, I was,
I was moved to tears.

39:32.303 --> 39:33.336
That's amazing.

39:33.338 --> 39:34.404
Yeah.
I mean that' sounds like an,

39:34.406 --> 39:36.172
that sounds like an
incredible thing

39:36.174 --> 39:36.840
to see.

39:36.842 --> 39:37.807
Mhmm.

39:37.809 --> 39:39.309
Wow.

39:39.311 --> 39:40.744
Yeah.

39:42.813 --> 39:44.247
And I kept saying
they're wiggling.

39:44.249 --> 39:46.916
T-they're like, they would
just wiggle like worms o-on

39:46.918 --> 39:49.052
each other.

39:49.054 --> 39:50.220
Um...

39:50.988 --> 39:51.888

41:07.298 --> 41:09.132
Did he really just
think I was mom?

41:09.934 --> 41:11.868
He's got to stop
smoking so much weed.

41:12.770 --> 41:13.970
I'm so sorry.

Okay.

43:43.887 --> 43:45.188
Nice dress.

Very attractive.

43:53.397 --> 43:54.464
Thanks.

43:57.334 --> 43:58.935
So you live around here?

43:58.937 --> 44:00.303
Yep.

44:00.305 --> 44:01.771
Yep, my whole life.

44:01.773 --> 44:03.272
Grew up here.

44:03.274 --> 44:04.674
Yeah, me too.

44:05.609 --> 44:08.077
It's funny, I've never
run into you here.

44:09.013 --> 44:10.913
Oh, I don't go out.

44:10.915 --> 44:12.915
Ever, at night... I...

44:12.917 --> 44:14.517
I was married, so.

44:14.519 --> 44:15.685
Was.

44:18.356 --> 44:20.990
Yeah, the jury's
still out, I think.

44:21.692 --> 44:23.059
Okay.

44:28.766 --> 44:30.700
Well it was, it was
good to see you.

44:30.702 --> 44:32.035
Mhmm.

44:36.173 --> 44:37.674
This is what I'm talking about.

44:37.676 --> 44:39.676
I'm talking about what the
world is going to look like in

44:39.678 --> 44:42.612
ten years, and you
apparently don't give a shit.

44:42.614 --> 44:44.313
I don't have to, I don't
have to defend myself to you.

44:44.315 --> 44:45.448
No, why would you.

44:45.450 --> 44:46.949
Why would you?

44:46.951 --> 44:50.019
Alex, this is the way the
If I don't build

44:50.021 --> 44:51.054
there, someone else will.

44:51.056 --> 44:52.822
Oh, God I hate that argument.

44:52.824 --> 44:53.723
I hate it!

44:53.725 --> 44:55.291
Okay, you hate this then.

44:55.293 --> 44:57.660
Do you know how many jobs I'm
providing for kids who have

44:57.662 --> 44:59.962
not had the luxury of
going to law school?

44:59.964 --> 45:02.498
Y-y-you, you know what the
community's like around

45:02.500 --> 45:03.800
that marsh.

45:03.802 --> 45:05.968
Half of the families
there are on food stamps.

45:06.537 --> 45:08.304
Families are going to eat
because of my spa, and you

45:08.306 --> 45:10.640
want to know how that looks
in the next ten years?

45:10.642 --> 45:13.409
I'm talking about a good
school, a great public park...

45:14.078 --> 45:17.547
And a kid like me can dream
of going to law school.

45:18.248 --> 45:19.749
That's my vision.

45:19.751 --> 45:20.750
Okay.

45:20.752 --> 45:22.819
No, I get it, I-I-I get that.

45:22.821 --> 45:25.321
I'm just saying,

45:25.323 --> 45:28.591
for me, I'm, I'm, I'm
worried about what

45:28.593 --> 45:30.059
It's going to look
like in ten years.

45:30.061 --> 45:32.895
What It's going to look like
a hundred years from now.

45:32.897 --> 45:34.764
That's what I'm thinking
about, and maybe that makes me

45:34.766 --> 45:35.998
a total weirdo. I don't know.

45:36.000 --> 45:37.467
Yeah, you are a weirdo.

45:38.202 --> 45:40.036
I mean in a, in a
good way though.

45:40.038 --> 45:41.270
Yeah.

45:50.180 --> 45:52.181
You want to know, um...

45:53.684 --> 45:56.452
How much of a
total weirdo I am?

45:58.021 --> 45:59.288
Sure.

46:02.893 --> 46:08.831
I've only had sex with
one person my whole life.

46:15.272 --> 46:16.272
Wow.

46:16.274 --> 46:17.807
Um...

46:18.909 --> 46:20.042
That's a...

46:20.044 --> 46:21.477
Big 180.

46:23.947 --> 46:25.648
Yeah. I um,

46:25.650 --> 46:30.119
I met George at 18, got
pregnant 19, and so now I'm...

46:30.121 --> 46:31.621
Totally fucked.

46:31.623 --> 46:32.989
You know?

46:33.490 --> 46:34.957
Uh huh.

46:35.726 --> 46:37.646
That's kind of
exciting actually.

46:39.496 --> 46:42.265
It's like you're starting
out for the second time.

46:42.267 --> 46:44.433
I mean, most people
they've done that already.

46:44.435 --> 46:46.002
It's in the past.

46:53.811 --> 46:56.479
So you want to
have sex with me?

47:10.494 --> 47:12.862
One morning I woke up
at the Chelsea hotel.

47:13.864 --> 47:15.164
I don't remember how I
got there,

47:15.166 --> 47:16.766
but that's another story.

47:16.768 --> 47:20.002
What I do remember is they
had a great egg scramble, and

47:20.004 --> 47:22.872
that's what we're making
the Chelsea hotel

47:22.874 --> 47:24.040
special.

47:24.042 --> 47:25.408
Do you like tomatoes?

47:27.845 --> 47:28.644
Morning.

47:28.646 --> 47:29.979
Morning!

47:29.981 --> 47:33.883
I worked all night and
fell asleep at the office.

47:34.685 --> 47:36.118
In my dress?

47:48.365 --> 47:49.866
Dad just texted me.

47:51.001 --> 47:52.301
So what did he say?

47:52.970 --> 47:54.370
He's still in Santa Fe.

47:57.140 --> 47:59.220
You want to skip school
and hit the beach?

48:21.999 --> 48:23.065
Oho!

48:39.716 --> 48:42.151
Ah, I just fucking
love/hate this city.

48:42.886 --> 48:45.087
I'm such a cali girl
at heart, really.

48:46.456 --> 48:47.690
Why'd you leave?

48:48.625 --> 48:49.258
I don't know.

48:49.260 --> 48:50.693
I needed a change.

48:53.230 --> 48:54.730
Is that what happens?

48:54.732 --> 48:55.452
What?

48:57.601 --> 48:59.435
Grown-ups get...

48:59.437 --> 49:00.736
Bored and...

49:00.738 --> 49:02.705
Need to change.

49:02.707 --> 49:05.908
Well, first of all, I am not
a grown-up, and second of all,

49:05.910 --> 49:07.576
are you talking about your dad?

49:07.578 --> 49:08.711
Okay, I'm just going tell

49:08.713 --> 49:10.646
he did not get bored of you.

49:12.416 --> 49:13.482
I'm serious.

49:13.484 --> 49:14.984
How could anyone
get bored of you?

49:14.986 --> 49:16.919
He's got his own shit going on.

49:16.921 --> 49:18.220
It's his problem.

49:21.058 --> 49:22.825
Other than that, we're still
waiting to hear from the

49:22.827 --> 49:24.627
environmental impact report.

49:24.629 --> 49:26.929
Vanessa, where are the
interns with the community?

49:26.931 --> 49:28.631
Nowhere. No one will sign the
petition.

49:28.633 --> 49:29.332
What?

49:29.334 --> 49:30.833
Alex, what's going on?

49:30.835 --> 49:32.435
That community's living below
the poverty line, Maureen,

49:32.437 --> 49:33.569
they're not going
to get on board.

49:33.571 --> 49:34.503
They want jobs.

49:34.505 --> 49:35.838
They don't know what they want.

49:35.840 --> 49:37.640
It's our job to educate them.

49:37.642 --> 49:39.108
You're totally right.

49:39.110 --> 49:40.509
Maureen, epa line two.

49:40.511 --> 49:41.811
What's up with your sister?

49:41.813 --> 49:42.812
What do you mean?

49:42.814 --> 49:43.512
Like what's her deal?

49:43.514 --> 49:44.914
What's she about?

49:44.916 --> 49:46.582
I dunno. She has a
clothing line,

49:46.584 --> 49:47.984
earth now, Vanessa speaking.
A fantasy clothing line,

49:47.986 --> 49:49.285
may I ask who's calling?
And a boyfriend.

49:49.287 --> 49:50.419
Oh. Okay.

49:50.421 --> 49:51.320
Sure.
Why?

49:51.322 --> 49:52.822
Please hold.
No reason.

49:52.824 --> 49:53.656
You should, but you should
bring her by my birthday party

49:53.658 --> 49:55.378
Alex, line one.
On Friday.

49:57.361 --> 49:58.361
Hello?

49:59.663 --> 50:00.563
Hi.

50:02.265 --> 50:03.265
Um...

50:05.102 --> 50:06.035
Oh.

50:07.437 --> 50:08.838
No, no, no.
No, no, no.

50:08.840 --> 50:09.939
You don't have to do that,
you don't have to do that.

50:09.941 --> 50:11.540
I will...

50:11.542 --> 50:12.875
I will be right out.

50:13.343 --> 50:14.276
Okay.

50:23.020 --> 50:23.986
Hi.

50:23.988 --> 50:25.054
Hello.

50:26.356 --> 50:28.791
Um, I'm actually really glad
that you called because I,

50:28.793 --> 50:32.795
I wanted to tell you that, um, I
was really drunk last night,

50:33.698 --> 50:36.632
and I'm really
embarrassed, so...

50:36.634 --> 50:37.967
Yeah, nobody needs
to know about that.

50:37.969 --> 50:39.209
You want to have lunch?

50:49.546 --> 50:50.846
Oh man.

50:51.849 --> 50:53.249
This is crazy.

50:53.251 --> 50:54.417
So this is what you do, huh?

50:54.419 --> 50:55.584
So this is what?

50:55.586 --> 50:58.654
This is what you do.
This is what I...

50:58.656 --> 50:59.822
N-no.

50:59.824 --> 51:00.990
This is like, is this
like your "game?"

51:00.992 --> 51:03.192
Like you, you know exactly
like, you know,

51:03.194 --> 51:04.760
you pick up the women at

51:04.762 --> 51:07.830
the bars and this is like you
show them your beautiful house

51:07.832 --> 51:09.498
and all your
beautiful things and.

51:09.500 --> 51:11.200
Uh-uh.

51:11.202 --> 51:12.168
Trap.

51:12.170 --> 51:12.935
Trap.

51:12.937 --> 51:15.104
Trap, gotcha.

51:15.939 --> 51:17.273
No.

51:17.874 --> 51:19.308
I don't do that I...

51:21.411 --> 51:24.046
I mean, I've gone to the bar...

51:24.048 --> 51:25.414
Uh huh.

51:25.416 --> 51:26.515
But I have...

51:27.084 --> 51:29.051
I've met women at the bar.
You have...

51:29.053 --> 51:30.519
Oh.

51:30.521 --> 51:31.454
I mean, I'm friendly.

51:35.358 --> 51:36.692
No?

51:36.694 --> 51:40.129
Well, I hope this, you know...

51:42.099 --> 51:43.699
Compares.

51:44.267 --> 51:45.634
I mean, I don't know
what I'm saying.

51:45.636 --> 51:47.336
I'm...

51:48.105 --> 51:49.405
Hmm.

51:49.407 --> 51:54.443
I hope that this has been
good in comparison to...

51:54.445 --> 51:57.646
The other women that you may
have or may not have brought

51:57.648 --> 51:58.948
home from the bar.

51:58.950 --> 52:00.316
Hm.

52:00.817 --> 52:01.584
Sh...

52:01.586 --> 52:03.052
I'm glad you're concerned.

52:05.755 --> 52:08.724
I'm glad you are concerned
with the outlook.

52:09.593 --> 52:12.161
So you're basically trying to
ask me did you rock my world?

52:13.263 --> 52:15.464
Shoot, you crazy girl.

52:19.503 --> 52:20.469
Voila.

52:20.471 --> 52:21.570
Thank you.

52:32.015 --> 52:33.215
Enjoy it?

52:34.117 --> 52:35.351
Mhmm.

52:35.353 --> 52:36.585
Yeah, It's amazing.

52:39.489 --> 52:40.823
So...

52:45.595 --> 52:46.896
What happened?

52:48.665 --> 52:49.698
What?

52:52.369 --> 52:53.369
Your husband.

52:59.342 --> 53:00.676
He wasn't happy.

53:05.115 --> 53:06.615
Apparently.

53:06.617 --> 53:08.784
So, so he um...

53:08.786 --> 53:10.219
So he got out.

53:11.855 --> 53:16.125
And now he's figuring out what
he wants to do with his life.

53:19.629 --> 53:22.198
I don't know, I
guess he felt like...

53:24.634 --> 53:26.435
I wasn't seeing him or...

53:32.075 --> 53:34.310
And I don't know,
maybe he's, he's right.

53:36.680 --> 53:38.247
Yeah, that can be hard.

53:38.249 --> 53:39.748
And uh...

53:39.750 --> 53:42.651
Getting married when you're
20, sometimes, uh, you change,

53:42.653 --> 53:44.553
and you don't change together.

53:47.490 --> 53:50.726
I didn't have it as figured
out as I thought I did.

53:55.999 --> 53:58.934
Am I crazy person
talking about my...

54:00.037 --> 54:01.503
I don't, I don't know.

54:01.505 --> 54:03.005
I kind of feel like this is
something you're not supposed

54:03.007 --> 54:04.240
to do.

54:05.775 --> 54:07.009
No.

54:07.011 --> 54:09.411
This some ploy to get
me to fuck up the case?

54:11.282 --> 54:12.948
You know what? It should be.

55:10.473 --> 55:13.208
Can we take it r-right before
the dance would be perfect.

55:18.281 --> 55:19.815
Oh petya,

55:20.617 --> 55:23.085
my darling, I'm so sorry.

55:23.853 --> 55:25.487
You sweet boy.

55:25.489 --> 55:26.121
Forgive me.

55:26.123 --> 55:27.489
Please, come dance.

55:28.291 --> 55:30.526
Come, come dance with me.

55:30.528 --> 55:32.094
<i>Roger, that's your entrance!</i>

55:33.530 --> 55:34.496
Yes.

55:34.498 --> 55:35.331
<i>That's always been your</i>
<i>entrance.</i>

55:35.333 --> 55:36.131
I'm sorry.
<i>You've gotta</i>

55:36.133 --> 55:37.466
tattoo that into your brain.

55:37.468 --> 55:39.001
That will always
be your entrance.

55:39.003 --> 55:40.703
Yeah I got it now, sorry.

55:42.472 --> 55:43.839
Do you want to go back or...

55:43.841 --> 55:45.121
<i>No, keep going.</i>

55:47.644 --> 55:49.378
What's the matter pops.

55:49.380 --> 55:50.679
Uh, I...

55:50.681 --> 55:53.182
I don't feel too well I'm...

55:54.451 --> 56:00.622
In the old days, we had a
dance we had, uh, we had um...

56:00.624 --> 56:01.724
Roger.

56:02.325 --> 56:04.126
<i>Roger, do you, do</i>
<i>you need a minute?</i>

56:04.128 --> 56:04.993
<i>'Cause I can't.</i>

56:04.995 --> 56:06.695
No I'm, I'm-I'm sorry.

56:06.697 --> 56:07.529
<i>You okay?</i>
I'm sorry, will,

56:07.531 --> 56:09.131
I just lost my place here.

56:09.133 --> 56:09.865
That's okay.

56:09.867 --> 56:11.467
You have to be off book.

56:11.469 --> 56:12.590
I'm sorry, I don't...

56:14.037 --> 56:15.537
It's just, at this, at this
point at this far along, It's,

56:15.539 --> 56:17.005
It's not fair to the other
actors and I don't know how to

56:17.007 --> 56:18.307
rehearse the play If
you're not good of it.

56:18.309 --> 56:18.974
You know?

56:18.976 --> 56:19.908
Okay.
<i>Okay?</i>

56:19.910 --> 56:21.176
<i>Okay, thanks so much.</i>
Yeah.

56:21.178 --> 56:23.078
<i>Take five you guys,</i>
<i>and then We'll uh...</i>

56:23.080 --> 56:23.846
Sorry guys.

56:23.848 --> 56:25.180
No, no, no, no, no, no.

56:25.182 --> 56:25.748
You...

56:25.750 --> 56:29.385
<i>I'm gonna make it rain!</i>

56:29.387 --> 56:31.186
<i>I got some rain rain...</i>

56:31.188 --> 56:32.187
<i>Rain rain!</i>

56:32.189 --> 56:33.222
<i>Champagne!</i>

56:33.224 --> 56:34.256
<i>Champagne!</i>

56:34.258 --> 56:35.190
<i>Poppin' bottles!</i>

56:35.192 --> 56:36.759
<i>Woop woop!</i>

56:36.761 --> 56:38.160
Woop woop!

56:38.162 --> 56:39.161
Poppin' bottles!

56:39.163 --> 56:40.362
Woop woop!
Poppin'...

56:40.364 --> 56:41.363
Woop woop!

56:41.365 --> 56:43.265
Woop woop, woop woop!

56:43.267 --> 56:44.400
Poppin' bottles!

56:44.402 --> 56:45.768
Poppin' bottles!

56:45.770 --> 56:46.769
We got some rain rain!

56:46.771 --> 56:47.536
Rain rain!

56:47.538 --> 56:48.604
Champagne!

56:48.606 --> 56:49.671
Champagne!

56:49.673 --> 56:51.834
Where your hundred
dollar bills at?

56:55.278 --> 56:56.278
Dad?

56:57.914 --> 56:58.847
Dad?

57:00.383 --> 57:01.784
I got confused.

57:01.786 --> 57:02.651
Uh...

57:03.553 --> 57:05.287
Just... got confused.

57:05.289 --> 57:06.455
Just, let me help you up...

57:06.457 --> 57:07.389
Go away.

57:07.391 --> 57:08.924
Just go away!

57:08.926 --> 57:11.093
Dad, this is your
shirt, It's...

57:11.095 --> 57:12.895
Get the fuck out!

57:12.897 --> 57:14.057
Get out!

57:16.065 --> 57:17.105
Go...

57:37.921 --> 57:40.656
'Cause I really
need a new bike too.

57:40.658 --> 57:43.058
'Cause mine's like,
falling apart, like.

57:43.060 --> 57:44.960
I think the tires popped.

57:44.962 --> 57:47.629
I tried pumping it back up
but, they just got flat right

57:47.631 --> 57:49.131
away again, so...

57:50.233 --> 57:51.733
Oh, okay.
It's just not working.

57:51.735 --> 57:53.135
And the chain keeps coming off.

57:53.137 --> 57:54.536
Mm.

57:56.072 --> 57:59.775
Well, I guess We'll have
to figure that out huh.

57:59.777 --> 58:02.297
Maybe You'll give me
that for my birthday.

58:04.180 --> 58:05.514
We'll see.

58:23.433 --> 58:24.700
Can we come in dad?

58:43.720 --> 58:45.420
Y-you didn't eat anything.

59:04.340 --> 59:06.740
Do you want us to take
you to the doctor?

59:56.225 --> 59:59.061
As you can see from our report
and from the witness testimony

59:59.063 --> 01:00:02.898
today, construction has only
been underway two months, and

01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:05.300
already the effects on the
life of the pond have been

01:00:05.302 --> 01:00:09.104
devastating, and we're asking
the court to halt construction

01:00:09.106 --> 01:00:10.639
until we can come
up with a solution.

01:00:10.641 --> 01:00:14.476
Either Mr. Evans moves
construction ten Miles west,

01:00:14.478 --> 01:00:16.945
or he alters his
construction plans.

01:00:24.420 --> 01:00:27.222
What it all comes down to,
your honor, is our legacy.

01:00:29.058 --> 01:00:31.498
<i>What do we want to</i>
<i>leave behind, a hotel?</i>

01:00:32.462 --> 01:00:33.729
<i>A spa?</i>

01:00:35.598 --> 01:00:37.966
<i>We can't prevent our ends,</i>
<i>but we can prevent the ends of</i>

01:00:37.968 --> 01:00:39.334
<i>this earth.</i>

01:00:39.336 --> 01:00:42.971
<i>We can make it so our great,</i>
<i>great grandchildren who we</i>

01:00:42.973 --> 01:00:46.942
<i>will never meet will swim</i>
<i>in the same ocean we did.</i>

01:00:46.944 --> 01:00:49.511
<i>Will hike the same Mountain.</i>

01:00:50.313 --> 01:00:51.747
<i>Enjoy the same view.</i>

01:00:58.354 --> 01:01:03.291
<i>I mean I, I find that</i>
<i>really comforting that...</i>

01:01:03.293 --> 01:01:05.927
No matter how out of control
or tenuous most of life is,

01:01:05.929 --> 01:01:08.329
there are some things
that are forever.

01:01:10.466 --> 01:01:12.367
If we fight for them...

01:01:19.642 --> 01:01:20.942
Thank you, your honor.

01:01:42.465 --> 01:01:44.900
The district sold the
land to Mr. Evans with the

01:01:44.902 --> 01:01:47.369
understanding that he would
abide by environmental

01:01:47.371 --> 01:01:48.737
standards.

01:01:48.739 --> 01:01:50.906
And in studying the
information put before me and

01:01:50.908 --> 01:01:53.308
the agreement made
with the district...

01:01:54.677 --> 01:01:58.980
It cannot clearly be proven
that the changes to the marsh

01:01:58.982 --> 01:02:01.983
is the fault of Mr.
Evans' construction.

01:02:05.421 --> 01:02:09.024
Loopholes in a prior contract
with the district have allowed

01:02:09.026 --> 01:02:10.726
for the current margin.

01:02:11.694 --> 01:02:14.663
This case is dismissed
without prejudice.

01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:18.467
Alex.

01:02:19.402 --> 01:02:20.869
Alex, come on.

01:02:20.871 --> 01:02:22.337
Congratulations, Frank.

01:02:22.339 --> 01:02:23.905
Hey, listen.

01:02:24.741 --> 01:02:26.374
Hey, I just want to talk
to you for a second.

01:02:26.376 --> 01:02:27.342
Alex!

01:02:27.344 --> 01:02:28.677
Alex!

01:03:31.007 --> 01:03:33.008
Come on, It's like, I thought
I was, I should get a bottle

01:03:33.010 --> 01:03:33.742
of wine...
Hi!

01:03:33.744 --> 01:03:34.843
But then I

01:03:34.845 --> 01:03:35.685
don't worry about it.

01:03:37.447 --> 01:03:38.079
Hey.
Hey.

01:03:38.081 --> 01:03:38.747
How are you doing?

01:03:38.749 --> 01:03:39.447
I'm good, I'm fine.

01:03:39.449 --> 01:03:40.182
You alright?

01:03:40.184 --> 01:03:40.849
Yeah, I'm totally fine.

01:03:40.851 --> 01:03:42.184
I'll see you, okay.

01:03:42.186 --> 01:03:43.852
Fucking hate parties.

01:03:43.854 --> 01:03:44.853
Wow.

01:03:44.855 --> 01:03:46.021
Alright, this is
going to turn up.

01:03:46.023 --> 01:03:47.489
I'm down.

01:03:47.491 --> 01:03:48.657
You know what lily?

01:03:48.659 --> 01:03:49.357
I don't think I'm going to
stay very long,

01:03:49.359 --> 01:03:50.525
just so you know.

01:03:50.527 --> 01:03:51.860
Oh come on.
Cause I'm in a shitty mood...

01:03:51.862 --> 01:03:52.794
What, you know what, we just
need to get you a drink.

01:03:52.796 --> 01:03:53.595
Let's get you some
Tequila, okay?

01:03:53.597 --> 01:03:54.529
Okay, I'll have one drink.

01:03:54.531 --> 01:03:56.264
Right, a lot of
young dick here.

01:03:56.266 --> 01:03:56.832
Yep.

01:03:56.834 --> 01:03:58.700
Lot of young dick.

01:03:58.702 --> 01:04:01.469
Look, tonight, I just want
you to forget about the case.

01:04:01.471 --> 01:04:03.205
Dakota's at a friend's house.

01:04:03.207 --> 01:04:05.807
Let's just try and have
a good time, alright?

01:04:05.809 --> 01:04:06.675
Fuck.

01:04:06.677 --> 01:04:07.442
Who are you texting?

01:04:07.444 --> 01:04:09.010
<i>Hey, Alex!</i>

01:04:09.012 --> 01:04:10.779
Birthday boy!

01:04:10.781 --> 01:04:11.980
Yeah, well It's
not my birthday.

01:04:11.982 --> 01:04:13.181
My birthday's on Monday.

01:04:13.183 --> 01:04:14.049
Oh, that's okay.
Oh.

01:04:14.051 --> 01:04:15.217
We're just celebrating tonight.

01:04:15.219 --> 01:04:16.518
That's alright.
That's right that's right.

01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:18.320
You guys look fucking great.

01:04:18.322 --> 01:04:18.887
Maybe, yeah.

01:04:18.889 --> 01:04:19.621
Jesus.

01:04:19.623 --> 01:04:20.655
Great feet, great feet.

01:04:20.657 --> 01:04:21.690
He's into feet.
Oh.

01:04:21.692 --> 01:04:22.958
I like it like that.

01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:24.226
Oh, I just got my toes done.
He likes feet!

01:04:24.228 --> 01:04:26.161
Hey, we're not going to
talk about it, right?

01:04:26.163 --> 01:04:27.162
Not going to talk about it.

01:04:27.164 --> 01:04:27.896
Uh-uh.

01:04:27.898 --> 01:04:28.363
We're going to have fun.

01:04:28.365 --> 01:04:29.030
Mm.

01:04:29.032 --> 01:04:29.698
Going to have fun.

01:04:29.700 --> 01:04:30.365
Woo!

01:04:30.367 --> 01:04:34.135
I lived in a redwood tree for
three months, and I didn't

01:04:34.137 --> 01:04:35.470
have anything.

01:04:35.472 --> 01:04:38.206
There were days where
I didn't have food.

01:04:40.177 --> 01:04:41.443
No.

01:04:42.144 --> 01:04:45.647
There were days I
didn't have water.

01:04:45.649 --> 01:04:47.249
I had to poop in a bucket.

01:04:47.984 --> 01:04:50.285
I had to piss off the tree.

01:04:51.754 --> 01:04:55.156
But I always found
time to have sex.

01:04:56.158 --> 01:04:58.118
Do you guys want
to do some ecstasy?

01:04:58.594 --> 01:04:59.327
No, no.

01:04:59.329 --> 01:05:00.762
No, we're good.

01:05:01.931 --> 01:05:03.598
Okay...

01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:05.066
I mean, I could...

01:05:06.669 --> 01:05:07.669
Do it.

01:05:07.671 --> 01:05:08.370
Yes!

01:05:08.372 --> 01:05:09.271
Yeah?

01:05:09.273 --> 01:05:10.672
Yes.

01:05:10.674 --> 01:05:11.273
Really?

01:05:11.275 --> 01:05:12.007
What?

01:05:12.009 --> 01:05:12.774
No? Why not?

01:05:12.776 --> 01:05:13.708
You'd peak too hard.

01:05:13.710 --> 01:05:14.509
Uh...

01:05:14.511 --> 01:05:15.377
Are you sure?

01:05:15.379 --> 01:05:17.212
Yes, I'm sure.

01:05:17.214 --> 01:05:18.446
'Cause you're pretty intense.

01:05:18.448 --> 01:05:20.715
Oh fuck you!

01:05:20.717 --> 01:05:22.918
I want the ecstasy please.

01:05:23.552 --> 01:05:24.586
Give it to her.
Just...

01:05:24.588 --> 01:05:25.854
I'm surprised you
haven't been sus...

01:05:25.856 --> 01:05:27.022
Prescribed this.

01:05:27.024 --> 01:05:28.089
Thank you.

01:05:32.595 --> 01:05:35.196
I am so excited for this.

01:05:35.198 --> 01:05:36.231
This is going to be
good for you.

01:05:36.233 --> 01:05:36.898
Yes.

01:05:36.900 --> 01:05:37.565
Oh shit.

01:05:37.567 --> 01:05:38.767
I gotta, one second.

01:05:38.769 --> 01:05:40.769
D-you sure you don't
want any ecstasy?

01:05:40.870 --> 01:05:43.104
I think Alex is going to
get really mad If I take x.

01:05:43.106 --> 01:05:46.608
I used to have like a bit of a
problem with like pills and...

01:05:46.610 --> 01:05:47.275
Stuff.
Oh.

01:05:47.277 --> 01:05:48.143
Yeah.

01:05:48.145 --> 01:05:49.144
I'm sorry.

01:05:49.146 --> 01:05:50.045
George?

01:05:50.047 --> 01:05:50.745
<i>Hey.</i>

01:05:50.747 --> 01:05:52.314
Hi.

01:05:52.316 --> 01:05:53.281
<i>How're you doing?</i>

01:05:54.483 --> 01:05:55.750
I'm good, yeah.

01:05:55.752 --> 01:05:56.985
Are you?

01:06:06.929 --> 01:06:08.863
What, he missed
a week of school?

01:06:15.272 --> 01:06:16.571
But, uh...

01:06:17.106 --> 01:06:18.907
I only had like two visitors.

01:06:20.177 --> 01:06:21.538
I'd only have sex
with one of them.

01:06:22.845 --> 01:06:24.346
I gotta call you back.

01:06:33.255 --> 01:06:34.990
Heh.
What are you looking at?

01:06:34.992 --> 01:06:36.272
Nothin'!

01:06:36.593 --> 01:06:37.926
Oh, hey lily.

01:06:37.928 --> 01:06:39.961
I meant to ask you,
how was this week?

01:06:39.963 --> 01:06:41.429
What do you mean?

01:06:41.431 --> 01:06:42.697
With Dakota, and taking him
to school and everything.

01:06:42.699 --> 01:06:43.999
Everything was okay, right?

01:06:44.533 --> 01:06:45.300
What do you mean?

01:06:45.302 --> 01:06:46.935
It was fine.

01:06:47.503 --> 01:06:48.503
So he didn't...

01:06:48.505 --> 01:06:51.172
Miss a week of
school this week?

01:06:53.209 --> 01:06:55.010
You're so full of shit.

01:06:56.645 --> 01:06:58.279
W-what are you talking about.

01:06:58.281 --> 01:06:59.381
Get out.

01:07:00.483 --> 01:07:02.117
I don't want to see your face.

01:07:02.119 --> 01:07:03.685
Get out!
Alex...

01:07:03.687 --> 01:07:04.619
Listen.

01:07:05.654 --> 01:07:07.956
He needed someone
to talk to, okay?

01:07:07.958 --> 01:07:09.324
He didn't need to go to school.

01:07:09.326 --> 01:07:10.358
He wanted to talk.

01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:11.659
Oh really?
Okay?

01:07:11.661 --> 01:07:12.727
You couldn't have yeah, we did.
Told me that?

01:07:12.729 --> 01:07:13.862
No, I couldn't.

01:07:13.864 --> 01:07:15.196
When?

01:07:15.198 --> 01:07:16.664
When is anyone supposed to
fucking tell you anything?

01:07:16.666 --> 01:07:18.566
This isn't how the
world works, lily.

01:07:18.568 --> 01:07:20.969
You can't let my kid
miss a week of school!

01:07:21.704 --> 01:07:23.438
Are you being
serious right now?

01:07:24.073 --> 01:07:25.306
You're...

01:07:25.308 --> 01:07:27.642
You're mad that Dakota
missed a week of school?

01:07:27.644 --> 01:07:29.544
Lily, I am his mother.

01:07:29.546 --> 01:07:33.081
You do not have the right to
take my son out of school.

01:07:33.083 --> 01:07:36.184
You do not have the right to
do anything with him without

01:07:36.186 --> 01:07:37.185
going through me first.

01:07:37.187 --> 01:07:38.353
Do you understand that?

01:07:38.355 --> 01:07:40.522
How does that not
get into your brain?

01:07:40.524 --> 01:07:43.158
Why are you... you think
you're so fucking perfect?

01:07:43.726 --> 01:07:45.226
You're not, Alex.

01:07:46.262 --> 01:07:47.729
Look at your life.

01:07:47.731 --> 01:07:48.963
It's a mess.

01:09:09.078 --> 01:09:10.545
Hi...

01:09:13.282 --> 01:09:15.582
I think I might need a ride.

01:09:16.785 --> 01:09:19.420
Yeah, I don't think I
should drive right now.

01:09:42.612 --> 01:09:43.578
Hey.

01:09:43.946 --> 01:09:45.013
Hi.

01:09:45.015 --> 01:09:46.113
Heh.

01:09:47.783 --> 01:09:48.850
You okay?

01:09:48.852 --> 01:09:50.350
Mmm.

01:09:51.353 --> 01:09:53.354
I don't know If I can walk.

01:10:05.167 --> 01:10:05.900
Here, have this.

01:10:07.237 --> 01:10:08.236
Mm.

01:10:13.375 --> 01:10:15.009
That's supposed to be...

01:10:15.011 --> 01:10:15.677
It...
That's supposed to help?

01:10:15.679 --> 01:10:16.811
It'll help.

01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:19.447
Mm.

01:10:22.484 --> 01:10:24.884
How am I gonna do
it without you?

01:10:25.421 --> 01:10:26.821
You're already doing it.

01:10:28.857 --> 01:10:31.593
Yeah. Dakota missed a week of
school and I'm coming down from

01:10:31.595 --> 01:10:33.094
ecstasy.

01:10:37.032 --> 01:10:37.932
Ugh.

01:10:44.374 --> 01:10:45.306
You're great.

01:10:47.710 --> 01:10:49.244
And you've always been great.

01:10:53.182 --> 01:10:53.848
Feel better?

01:10:53.850 --> 01:10:57.352
Thank you for getting
me water and tangerines.

01:10:58.520 --> 01:10:59.787
Do you want something else?

01:11:00.356 --> 01:11:01.089
No.

01:11:01.091 --> 01:11:01.723
Are you sure?

01:11:01.725 --> 01:11:02.757
Yeah, I just...

01:11:02.759 --> 01:11:03.558
Do you want me to go?

01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:04.659
No.

01:11:05.094 --> 01:11:06.294
No, please.

01:11:10.799 --> 01:11:11.933
How's your dad?

01:11:15.704 --> 01:11:16.971
I don't know.

01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:18.673
I don't know.

01:11:21.410 --> 01:11:23.211
I went to the doctor and, uh...

01:11:25.714 --> 01:11:26.748
I don't know.

01:11:26.750 --> 01:11:28.683
He might have
Alzheimer's, just...

01:12:15.864 --> 01:12:17.332
It's time to go.

01:12:38.153 --> 01:12:42.724
We had a dance and
we had generals...

01:12:43.792 --> 01:12:45.226
And admirals,

01:12:45.228 --> 01:12:46.160
and, uh...

01:12:46.162 --> 01:12:47.228
N-no.

01:12:47.230 --> 01:12:50.665
Generals and barons
and admirals.

01:12:50.667 --> 01:12:51.666
Yeah

01:12:51.668 --> 01:12:55.636
and nowadays we,
we have the um...

01:12:56.572 --> 01:12:58.773
Nowadays we have...

01:12:59.341 --> 01:13:00.508
We have to send out.

01:13:00.510 --> 01:13:01.876
Ah, yeah.

01:13:01.878 --> 01:13:04.712
Nowadays we have to send
out for the postman?

01:13:04.714 --> 01:13:05.413
Postmaster.

01:13:05.415 --> 01:13:07.148
Oh, postmaster.

01:13:07.150 --> 01:13:08.049
And...

01:13:08.051 --> 01:13:09.417
Stationmaster.

01:13:13.155 --> 01:13:15.316
Good morning.
Shit.

01:13:21.597 --> 01:13:22.877
You're back?

01:13:26.902 --> 01:13:28.269
Where's Dakota?

01:13:29.772 --> 01:13:31.139
He's in the back.

01:13:44.686 --> 01:13:45.987
Dad!

01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:53.200
Hey.

01:13:54.631 --> 01:13:55.911
Looking good!

01:14:05.941 --> 01:14:07.375
Mom's the worst cook.

01:14:08.577 --> 01:14:11.097
Well she's, yeah
she's pretty bad.

01:14:11.947 --> 01:14:13.227
Used to be good.

01:14:15.884 --> 01:14:17.718
When we were younger she,
I think she's just...

01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:20.822
I think she's just
out of practice.

01:14:22.791 --> 01:14:25.393
Was that why?

01:14:28.430 --> 01:14:29.831
What?

01:14:35.838 --> 01:14:37.672
'Cause she's a bad cook?

01:14:38.807 --> 01:14:40.174
No, no.

01:14:43.612 --> 01:14:45.146
No?

01:14:45.148 --> 01:14:47.915
Well I don't know, you know,
just, when you're young, you,

01:14:47.917 --> 01:14:48.749
you...

01:14:48.751 --> 01:14:50.031
I mean I...

01:14:51.253 --> 01:14:54.255
You know, when you get older
people change, and, and...

01:14:54.257 --> 01:14:58.826
It's good changes, good,
but you, uh, sometimes...

01:14:58.828 --> 01:15:01.529
Sometimes change is uh...

01:15:03.465 --> 01:15:05.833
Painful, and uh...

01:15:05.835 --> 01:15:08.135
You know, but...

01:15:08.137 --> 01:15:10.705
But It's necessary.

01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:13.374
Right?

01:15:14.343 --> 01:15:18.112
You know, It's, It's
a, It's not, um...

01:15:25.954 --> 01:15:27.388
Will you come back?

01:15:28.624 --> 01:15:29.857
I, I'm back.

01:15:29.859 --> 01:15:32.527
Yeah, I'm back.
I'm back forever.

01:15:32.529 --> 01:15:33.194
With you.

01:15:33.196 --> 01:15:34.562
But I'm...

01:15:38.734 --> 01:15:42.069
I don't think I'm
coming back...

01:15:42.071 --> 01:15:43.471
To your mom's.

01:15:55.817 --> 01:15:57.285
Goodbye, house.

01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:00.421
Goodbye old life.

01:16:03.191 --> 01:16:06.060
Shh, no, no, no, no, no.

01:16:06.828 --> 01:16:08.796
It's hello new life.

01:16:10.566 --> 01:16:11.846
I know.

01:16:13.402 --> 01:16:15.636
I know, I know...

01:16:17.339 --> 01:16:18.906
I know.

01:16:19.942 --> 01:16:21.275
Hello new life!

01:16:28.250 --> 01:16:29.617
I'm sorry, I...

01:16:29.619 --> 01:16:31.185
No, I'm sorry.

01:16:31.187 --> 01:16:32.753
I, I fucked up.

01:16:32.755 --> 01:16:34.121
I should've taken
Dakota to school.

01:16:34.123 --> 01:16:35.590
I don't know what
I was thinking.

01:16:35.592 --> 01:16:36.872
Lily.

01:16:38.627 --> 01:16:40.695
I'm really glad you came.

01:16:41.296 --> 01:16:43.336
Really?
Really.

01:16:44.099 --> 01:16:45.379
Thank you.

01:16:54.142 --> 01:16:55.776
George isn't coming back.

01:17:03.485 --> 01:17:04.765
I think...

01:17:06.088 --> 01:17:08.823
I think things changed

01:17:08.825 --> 01:17:11.158
between us a long time ago,
and I just

01:17:11.160 --> 01:17:12.860
didn't see it.

01:17:20.435 --> 01:17:21.802
What are you going to do?

01:17:25.173 --> 01:17:26.453
I don't know.

01:17:31.113 --> 01:17:33.673
All I know is I want to
spend time with my son.

01:17:43.091 --> 01:17:44.825
Oh, my beautiful...

01:17:46.128 --> 01:17:47.895
Beautiful orchard.

01:17:51.466 --> 01:17:52.746
You were my life.

01:17:55.837 --> 01:17:57.371
You were my youth.

01:17:58.940 --> 01:18:00.241
My happiness.

01:18:03.845 --> 01:18:05.246
Goodbye.

01:18:07.382 --> 01:18:09.717
You got him.
Finally got him.

01:18:09.719 --> 01:18:11.385
Drew him.

01:18:11.387 --> 01:18:12.720
Then this is um...

01:18:12.722 --> 01:18:14.055
I love its eyes.
This is,

01:18:14.057 --> 01:18:16.157
this is the one for grandpa.

01:18:16.159 --> 01:18:17.024
Um...

01:18:17.026 --> 01:18:18.125
Henry the...

01:18:18.127 --> 01:18:19.326
And there's grandpa.

01:18:19.328 --> 01:18:21.595
Gave him his
favorite hat there.

01:18:22.297 --> 01:18:27.168
And I wanted this one of,
um, Friday, 'cause,

01:18:27.170 --> 01:18:30.204
wonder wouldn't come on the
back porch with...

01:18:32.841 --> 01:18:34.761
Hey.
Hey.

01:18:42.050 --> 01:18:44.285
I want you to know

01:18:45.220 --> 01:18:49.690
that this has nothing to do
with you, okay?

01:18:49.692 --> 01:18:50.791
Okay?

01:18:51.893 --> 01:18:52.960
You hear me?

01:18:54.162 --> 01:18:55.963
I love you.

01:18:57.032 --> 01:18:59.600
And your dad loves you.

01:18:59.602 --> 01:19:01.836
And that is never
going to change.

01:19:01.838 --> 01:19:04.238
That is never going
to change ever.

01:19:05.107 --> 01:19:06.440
Okay?

01:19:06.442 --> 01:19:07.608
Come here.

01:19:14.082 --> 01:19:15.483
Is everybody gone?

01:19:21.690 --> 01:19:23.157
Is there anyone left?

01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:33.134
Alright.

01:19:33.136 --> 01:19:34.535
Let's go.

01:20:16.278 --> 01:20:18.012
They've gone away.

01:20:23.018 --> 01:20:25.152
They forgot about me.

01:20:43.305 --> 01:20:45.272
Life has gone on

01:20:47.375 --> 01:20:49.677
as If I never lived.

01:20:59.020 --> 01:21:00.554
I'll lie back.

01:21:18.073 --> 01:21:20.941
You have no strength
left in you.

01:21:23.011 --> 01:21:25.579
Nothing left at all.

01:21:26.414 --> 01:21:29.383
Huh, you...

01:21:29.385 --> 01:21:31.051
Bungler.

01:22:05.687 --> 01:22:06.887
Heya!
Oh my God!

01:22:06.889 --> 01:22:08.188
Oh, ho!

01:22:08.190 --> 01:22:09.089
You were so amazing!

01:22:09.091 --> 01:22:10.331
This cherry orchard's the shit!

01:22:11.127 --> 01:22:12.126
Dad!

01:22:12.128 --> 01:22:13.527
You killed it.

01:22:13.529 --> 01:22:14.795
That was awesome!
You killed it brother.

01:22:14.797 --> 01:22:16.430
Straight to Broadway!

01:22:17.966 --> 01:22:19.700
So did you like the play?

01:22:20.568 --> 01:22:21.568
Yeah.

01:22:21.570 --> 01:22:22.136
Yeah?

01:22:22.138 --> 01:22:23.178
I liked it.

01:22:24.072 --> 01:22:25.272
It's crazy.

01:22:25.274 --> 01:22:27.754
He wrote it like, over
a hundred years ago.

01:22:28.643 --> 01:22:30.044
Yeah, It's kind of cool.

01:22:30.046 --> 01:22:34.148
People have the same
problems then as they do now.

01:22:34.150 --> 01:22:36.617
Yeah, it is kind of cool.

01:22:39.087 --> 01:22:41.255
Hey, can I have a lick
of your chocolate?

01:22:41.257 --> 01:22:43.624
I told you the jalapeno
would be disgusting

01:22:43.626 --> 01:22:45.059
after the 3rd lick.

01:22:45.061 --> 01:22:45.926
I know.

01:22:45.928 --> 01:22:47.995
I know, I should've listened.
