Wake up.

00:04.159 --> 00:05.826
Wake up.

00:07.329 --> 00:08.596
Hi, Emma.

00:08.630 --> 00:10.231
Emma!

00:11.934 --> 00:13.935
This isn't what it looks like.

00:13.970 --> 00:16.505
You don't care. You're two.

00:16.539 --> 00:19.274
Hey, Zoey. Zoey!

00:19.308 --> 00:21.610
Uh, I guess I kind of dozed off.

00:21.644 --> 00:24.613
Huh, me too. I should probably be going.

00:24.647 --> 00:25.914
- Yeah, I got to, uh...
- Totally.

00:25.948 --> 00:27.783
- Yeah, maybe we can do this again...
- That would be great!

00:27.817 --> 00:29.384
- Maybe without the kids next...
- I'm in. See ya!

00:29.418 --> 00:30.585
Yeah, okay.

00:32.354 --> 00:33.889
I think this one is yours.

00:33.923 --> 00:34.923
Right.

Oh, Sam, hi!

00:53.142 --> 00:54.376
Uh, you're back early.

00:54.410 --> 00:56.545
I hope everything worked
out with my uncle's cabin.

00:56.579 --> 00:57.712
It was great.

00:57.747 --> 00:59.381
Except for the fact that you forgot

00:59.415 --> 01:00.916
to tell your uncle we are coming.

01:01.951 --> 01:03.819
Getting arrested was fun.

01:07.423 --> 01:10.425
Oh. Hey, everyone.

01:10.459 --> 01:11.526
So I guess I just tiptoed

01:11.561 --> 01:14.095
through the living room for nothing.

01:14.130 --> 01:15.297
You spent the night with Ben?

01:15.331 --> 01:17.399
- No.
- Yes.

01:18.534 --> 01:20.635
Yes. We just slept together.

01:20.670 --> 01:21.770
Regular sleep.

01:21.804 --> 01:24.072
Not the kind I can
see you both picturing.

01:24.106 --> 01:27.475
Oh, uh, they're a
couple. They kissed and...

01:27.510 --> 01:30.478
he's pretty good, right?

01:30.513 --> 01:31.947
Oh, my God, please don't ever tell Danny

01:31.981 --> 01:33.982
that I said that.

01:34.016 --> 01:35.984
Got it. I'm just gonna...

01:36.018 --> 01:37.052
Yeah.

01:38.955 --> 01:40.589
So...

01:40.623 --> 01:42.023
I guess Ben got over his little crush

01:42.058 --> 01:43.391
on me pretty quickly, huh?

01:43.426 --> 01:44.693
Little crush?

01:44.727 --> 01:46.261
He texted me a picture of the campsite

01:46.295 --> 01:47.295
he built for me.

01:47.330 --> 01:49.397
He was definitely crushing.

01:49.432 --> 01:51.900
Gosh, I guess I never
realized how sweet he could be.

01:51.934 --> 01:53.702
Maybe I misjudged him.

01:53.736 --> 01:55.604
No, no, no. I don't think so.

01:55.638 --> 01:56.705
Did I mention how perfect

01:56.739 --> 01:57.939
Ben and Zoey are together?

01:57.974 --> 01:59.207
Hey, roomie...

01:59.242 --> 02:00.342
Hey...

02:00.376 --> 02:01.676
so, we just heard all about

02:01.711 --> 02:04.713
your "little sleepover"
with Zoey last night.

02:04.747 --> 02:06.882
Feel free to lose the
air quotes and innuendo.

02:06.916 --> 02:08.015
Nothing happened.

02:08.050 --> 02:09.184
Having kids in bed with you

02:09.217 --> 02:10.619
is the best way to prevent more kids.

02:12.521 --> 02:15.123
Hey... so, since my little getaway

02:15.157 --> 02:16.892
got washed out, I was thinking about

02:16.926 --> 02:18.960
going up to my folks'
place in the Hamptons

02:18.995 --> 02:21.096
for a day or two... Do
you wanna come along?

02:21.130 --> 02:24.332
Really? Sweet, yeah,
that would be so cool.

02:24.367 --> 02:25.367
- Great.
- Okay.

02:25.401 --> 02:26.668
You'll love it.

02:31.807 --> 02:34.075
Oh, my God. What the
hell is wrong with you?

02:34.110 --> 02:36.144
You just spent the night with
Zoey, and now you're running off

02:36.178 --> 02:37.445
for a weekend with Sam?

02:37.480 --> 02:39.314
Calm down! Sam has
made it abundantly clear

02:39.348 --> 02:40.615
that we're just friends.

02:40.650 --> 02:42.417
Yeah, until she found out
that you might actually

02:42.451 --> 02:44.452
have feelings for someone else.

02:44.487 --> 02:47.222
Oh, my God, do you not
speak a word of "girl"?

02:47.256 --> 02:49.491
You're just jealous 'cause
she didn't invite you.

02:49.525 --> 02:55.130
Oh, please. Come on. Like I care
about going to the stupid Hamptons.

02:55.164 --> 02:57.599
Hey, Riley, do you and
Danny want to come, too?

02:57.633 --> 03:01.036
Yes, we would! That would be so amazing,

03:01.070 --> 03:02.604
I've never been to the Hamptons.

03:07.410 --> 03:09.544
I'm just going to keep an eye on you.

03:12.982 --> 03:15.650
Hey, Brad, honey, get
ready to grab a screenshot.

03:15.685 --> 03:17.185
You're gonna want this.

03:17.219 --> 03:18.653
Bonnie, wait.

03:18.688 --> 03:20.055
Wait? Do you have any idea

03:20.089 --> 03:22.624
how long it took to me
to find the right angle?

03:22.658 --> 03:24.559
Bonnie, you know how I...

03:24.593 --> 03:26.061
that it just wasn't...

03:26.095 --> 03:27.829
I met someone.

03:27.863 --> 03:31.700
I'm sorry? It sounded like
you said you met someone.

03:31.734 --> 03:35.070
I did. I just hope
you understand that...

03:36.839 --> 03:38.907
What?

03:38.941 --> 03:41.643
Oh, I understand, all right.

03:44.747 --> 03:47.315
I understand that that is
the second most awful thing

03:47.350 --> 03:49.784
to happen to me over a webcam. Oh!

03:49.819 --> 03:51.353
Hey, hey!

03:51.387 --> 03:54.422
200 pounds of baby crap
for your weekend with Emma.

03:56.525 --> 03:58.259
I can totally come back later.

03:58.294 --> 04:01.162
Brad left me for some Peruvian floozy!

04:09.505 --> 04:11.406
There, there.

04:11.440 --> 04:12.807
- Hold me!
- Oh, my God!

04:14.143 --> 04:17.911
So many bad things happening.
There's just nowhere to look.

04:21.618 --> 04:23.352
Just give me one good
reason why we should go

04:23.386 --> 04:24.753
to the Hamptons with Sam.

04:24.788 --> 04:26.522
You've hated her since high school.

04:26.556 --> 04:28.791
So? Why should hating people

04:28.825 --> 04:30.960
stop you from enjoying
their beach houses?

04:32.596 --> 04:34.864
Plus, we need to be
there for Ben, all right?

04:34.898 --> 04:35.965
He just started seeing Zoey,

04:35.999 --> 04:37.900
and I think Sam is trying
to put the moves on him.

04:37.934 --> 04:40.603
And you really think that
we can keep him off of her?

04:40.637 --> 04:41.871
I mean, when it comes to Ben,

04:41.905 --> 04:43.806
there's only two things you
shouldn't try to get between...

04:43.840 --> 04:45.574
and Sam's got both of them.

04:47.344 --> 04:49.411
Besides, I don't want you
getting all weird and jealous.

04:49.446 --> 04:52.572
Weird and jealous? Why
would I be weird and jealous?

04:52.672 --> 04:56.375
I mean, it's not like you've
ever had feelings for her.

04:56.409 --> 04:59.345
You never did have
feelings for her, right?

04:59.379 --> 05:02.614
Oh, my God, no! We've been over this.

05:02.649 --> 05:05.185
No feelings for Sam,
ever. Not then, not now,

05:05.285 --> 05:07.353
and if I did, I would've told you.

05:07.387 --> 05:10.089
You know what? This
conversation is exactly why

05:10.124 --> 05:11.157
we are not going.

05:16.730 --> 05:17.764
We're going, aren't we?

05:17.798 --> 05:19.465
Okay, if you insist!

05:23.638 --> 05:24.838
Here we are...

05:24.872 --> 05:26.606
Welcome to your Hamptons hideaway.

05:26.641 --> 05:28.141
Sorry about your bag
getting lost, Riley,

05:28.176 --> 05:29.810
but you can borrow my bikini.

05:29.844 --> 05:32.012
No, she can't.

05:35.149 --> 05:37.651
So, uh, you guys can
have the master bedroom,

05:37.685 --> 05:39.853
and Ben and I will share
my old room upstairs.

05:39.887 --> 05:42.689
We're gonna share? One
room together? You and me?

05:42.724 --> 05:45.525
Calm down. There are two
beds. I think you'll be safe.

05:47.229 --> 05:50.779
See? I told you she only wants
you now that you don't want her.

05:50.879 --> 05:52.714
And who says I don't want her?

05:52.748 --> 05:53.773
I had one kiss with Zoey.

05:53.873 --> 05:56.975
One kiss does not a relationship make.

05:57.010 --> 05:59.144
But many kisses does make
for a pretty great weekend.

Yeah, this is a great party.

Hey, Danny!

08:17.214 --> 08:19.048
Oh, it's so good to see you,

08:19.083 --> 08:20.850
like, out and about.

08:20.884 --> 08:22.418
I normally don't come
to these kind of things,

08:22.453 --> 08:23.228
but when Riley asked
me to be her date...

08:23.328 --> 08:25.162
Oh, look, they have cake. Come on.

08:27.832 --> 08:31.335

08:32.703 --> 08:34.638
Oh, hey, Sam, how's it going?

08:34.673 --> 08:36.340
You really know how
to fill out a uniform.

08:36.374 --> 08:37.508
In case you were wondering,

08:37.542 --> 08:39.476
my braces come off in two weeks.

08:40.611 --> 08:42.578
- Oh, no! Oh, no!

08:46.899 --> 08:49.634
Uh, Ben and Riley, if you
could just, uh, set the table,

08:49.668 --> 08:53.738
and Danny, if you wanna
grab the burgers...

08:53.772 --> 08:55.406

09:27.105 --> 09:29.106
Hi. Are you coming?

09:34.297 --> 09:35.931
Maybe we can go away together sometime.

09:35.966 --> 09:37.800
Hey, how's the little guy doing?

09:37.834 --> 09:39.435
Okay. Gotta go. Bye!

09:39.469 --> 09:40.803
I was just checking in on Emma.

09:43.240 --> 09:45.140
Wow, that wasn't totally obvious.

09:46.443 --> 09:47.843
I'm so confused, man.

09:47.878 --> 09:49.979
I feel like I might be starting
something great with Zoey,

09:50.013 --> 09:52.314
but obviously I also
have feelings for Sam,

09:52.349 --> 09:54.717
and for the first time ever,
she's actually giving off signs

09:54.751 --> 09:55.918
that she might like me back.

09:55.952 --> 09:58.382
Well, if you're asking
for advice, little bro,

09:58.482 --> 10:00.183
you have come to the right place.

10:01.119 --> 10:02.186
Wait, what'd you ask me again?

10:03.488 --> 10:05.189
Oh, right, yeah, Zoey.

10:05.223 --> 10:06.623
I think she can be really special.

10:06.658 --> 10:09.493
I don't know. I think
you're right, and then...

10:09.527 --> 10:10.761
Ready to go to the beach?

10:10.795 --> 10:12.529
That happens.

10:13.631 --> 10:14.898
Yeah, let me just grab my suit.

10:17.335 --> 10:19.870
Hey, Sam... this might
be kind of awkward, but...

10:19.904 --> 10:22.130
You never told Riley that
we hooked up in high school,

10:22.230 --> 10:23.898
you're afraid she'll
freak if she finds out,

10:23.932 --> 10:25.599
and you'd rather I kept it to myself?

10:25.634 --> 10:27.802
Yeah, that pretty much covers it.

10:29.104 --> 10:30.104
Our little secret.

10:32.675 --> 10:34.976
And this is where the magic happens.

10:35.010 --> 10:38.680
Oh! I didn't realize
you were a magician.

10:39.882 --> 10:42.317
Well, I have made two
husbands disappear.

10:42.351 --> 10:45.820
Oh, it looks like you're
expecting company, so I'll just...

10:45.854 --> 10:47.522
Girl has no business going fishing

10:47.556 --> 10:49.357
if she doesn't know how to bait a hook.

10:49.391 --> 10:51.225
Do you fish as well?

10:52.761 --> 10:55.263
Maybe I should've done one
more lap around the bar.

10:57.266 --> 10:59.601
- Oh, let's drink, all right?
- Okay.

10:59.635 --> 11:01.603
- Champagne, huh?
- Oh, all right.

11:01.637 --> 11:02.704
Yes.

11:02.738 --> 11:04.505
- Allow me.
- Okay.

11:04.540 --> 11:05.840
Whoo!

11:05.874 --> 11:07.208
- Oh, jeez!
- Oh!

11:07.242 --> 11:08.409
Oh, my...

11:08.444 --> 11:09.711
- Malcolm, are you okay?
- No, I'm okay!

11:09.745 --> 11:10.845
- Aah!
- Oh, God...

11:13.185 --> 11:15.586
Well, this isn't how I thought
we'd end up on the floor.

11:18.357 --> 11:19.790
Perfect.

11:19.825 --> 11:22.994
Mrs. Wheeler occupied, Emma asleep...

11:23.028 --> 11:26.464
It is finally Tucker time. Yes!

11:27.633 --> 11:30.368
Hola, muchacho. Que pasa?

11:30.402 --> 11:33.870
That's Peruvian for,
"Hey, dude. Que pasa?"

11:35.352 --> 11:37.086
What the hell are you doing here?

11:37.120 --> 11:40.155
That's Tucker for, "What
the hell are you doing here?"

11:40.190 --> 11:41.990
I came back to surprise Bonnie,

11:42.025 --> 11:43.826
but I was hoping that
I could clean up first.

11:43.860 --> 11:45.494
- But I thought you met someone.
- I did.

11:45.528 --> 11:46.628
Someone with a private plane

11:46.663 --> 11:48.130
who was willing to fly me home.

11:48.164 --> 11:51.033
I just couldn't stay away from
my Bon-Bon one second longer.

11:52.502 --> 11:53.669
Uh...

11:53.703 --> 11:55.463
Actually, you know what?
I'm glad you're here.

11:55.563 --> 11:57.731
Yeah, I just need to run
out for a couple of seconds.

11:57.766 --> 11:59.266
No reason, nothing to
be suspicious about.

11:59.300 --> 12:02.736
If you could just keep an eye on
the baby, that'd be great. Thank you.

12:02.771 --> 12:06.407
Wow, Tucker has a baby now, too.

12:06.441 --> 12:08.642
How long have I been gone?

12:12.781 --> 12:16.117
Mrs. Wheeler, you need to send
that guy packing right now.

12:16.151 --> 12:17.418
Wow...

12:17.453 --> 12:20.388
I knew this day would come.

12:20.422 --> 12:22.590
And yeah, I've thought about it, but...

12:22.624 --> 12:24.759
you're best friends with my sons.

12:24.793 --> 12:26.661
No, no! Your date!

12:27.930 --> 12:29.330
Wait, what are you doing out here?

12:29.365 --> 12:32.200
Fighting my conscience.
But that bitch is strong.

12:32.735 --> 12:33.969
I can't stop thinking about Brad.

12:34.003 --> 12:35.103
Brad's back.

12:35.138 --> 12:36.171
What?

12:36.205 --> 12:37.305
I thought he met someone.

12:37.340 --> 12:39.574
Yeah, someone with a private plane.

12:39.609 --> 12:41.643
To fly him home to you.

12:41.678 --> 12:42.744
Oh...

12:43.880 --> 12:45.847
Hey, loser, time to hit the road.

12:45.882 --> 12:50.601
Good news! I took two
aspirin and I feel a looot...

12:54.480 --> 12:55.645
Oh, my God, what did you do to him?

12:55.745 --> 12:56.844
I didn't do anything to him.

12:56.880 --> 12:58.563
I just gave him some aspirin.

12:58.598 --> 12:59.614
Oh, crap.

12:59.616 --> 13:02.516
These aren't aspirin,
these are sleeping pills!

13:02.552 --> 13:04.535
Brad is gonna be here any minute.

13:04.587 --> 13:06.422
Okay, all right. You go stall Brad,

13:06.522 --> 13:08.371
- and I will get rid of the body.
- Okay!

13:11.310 --> 13:13.293
God, it's like spring
break all over again.

13:15.715 --> 13:18.082
Night. Thanks for a great day.

13:18.084 --> 13:20.050
Who would've thought, the two
of us sharing a room together?

13:20.102 --> 13:23.020
Not me, no. Never crossed my mind.

13:23.055 --> 13:25.022
- Good night, Ben.
- Good night.

13:39.772 --> 13:43.107
Do you mind? I get a little cold.

13:43.109 --> 13:45.659
Maybe you wouldn't be so cold
if you had some clothes on.

13:48.047 --> 13:49.079
Do you want me to go?

13:56.668 --> 13:57.733
I can't do this.

13:57.769 --> 14:00.503
Really? Feels like
you're pretty ready to me.

14:00.555 --> 14:02.605
No, it's...
it's not right.

14:02.640 --> 14:05.608
Oh... are you a lights-on kind of guy?

14:05.643 --> 14:08.427
Well, yes, but... No! That...
that's not what I meant.

14:09.597 --> 14:11.530
I feel like I'm cheating on Zoey.

14:11.566 --> 14:12.531
I know that sounds stupid.

14:12.567 --> 14:14.333
In some ways I barely know her,

14:14.385 --> 14:16.819
but in other ways, I feel
like I've known her forever.

14:18.389 --> 14:19.772
Well, Zoey's not here right now,

14:19.807 --> 14:21.407
and it's not like I
had to twist your arm

14:21.442 --> 14:22.708
to come to the beach.

14:22.744 --> 14:23.809
No, I know, I thought
this is what I wanted.

14:23.845 --> 14:26.579
I've literally laid in
bed a thousand nights

14:26.631 --> 14:28.581
and thought about this very moment.

14:28.633 --> 14:30.616
You know, minus this odd breakdown.

14:33.554 --> 14:36.422
I guess I just keep running
away from Zoey because...

14:36.457 --> 14:37.823
she seems so real.

14:37.825 --> 14:41.744
And if I start something
with her, it may not end.

14:42.830 --> 14:45.364
Maybe I don't want it to end.

14:45.416 --> 14:46.382
Maybe I want
to be with her...

14:46.417 --> 14:47.817
Oh, my God, why am I telling you this?

14:47.852 --> 14:49.685
What is wrong with me?

14:49.721 --> 14:51.587
The only thing that's wrong with you

14:51.622 --> 14:54.540
is that you're here and not there.

14:56.561 --> 14:57.576
Thank you for understanding.

15:00.515 --> 15:02.548
Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God!

15:02.583 --> 15:04.467
Just calm down. It's gonna be fine.

15:04.502 --> 15:05.468
No, it's not gonna be fine.

15:05.503 --> 15:07.520
Does this look fine to you?

15:07.572 --> 15:10.339
I had jellyfish stuck to my left breast!

15:10.375 --> 15:12.475
It... Who goes swimming in
the middle of the night?

15:12.527 --> 15:15.761
I'm sorry. I thought
it would be romantic.

15:15.797 --> 15:17.396
Hey, maybe we can get a jellyfish to

15:17.448 --> 15:19.348
bite the other one and even 'em out.

15:19.384 --> 15:21.634
I will if you will.

15:25.807 --> 15:27.640
Hey, I'm heading back to the city.

15:27.642 --> 15:28.708
I think I can just catch the last train.

15:28.743 --> 15:30.676
You were right. Zoey and I are meant

15:30.712 --> 15:32.478
to be together, and
I have to go tell her.

15:33.648 --> 15:35.464
There's something about you...

15:35.516 --> 15:36.465
You look good.

15:41.823 --> 15:42.856
I hate the Hamptons.

15:47.422 --> 15:48.555
Brad, just calm down, man.

15:48.590 --> 15:50.473
I'm sure I can find her if
you just give me a minute.

15:50.509 --> 15:53.109
I'm beginning to think that
you have no idea where she is.

15:53.111 --> 15:56.463
We have been to six bars, four
night clubs, and a speakeasy.

15:56.515 --> 15:59.999
Also, I'm beginning to think that maybe
she's developing a drinking problem.

16:00.035 --> 16:03.269
Wow. You really have
been gone a long time.

16:04.322 --> 16:06.339
Wait... her light's on.

16:06.374 --> 16:09.325
She's home! Oh, I gotta get over there!

16:10.362 --> 16:12.178
Tucker?

16:13.265 --> 16:15.064
Donde esta?

16:17.119 --> 16:18.118
A few more feet...

16:18.170 --> 16:20.003
- Okay.
- And you're just another drunk

16:20.055 --> 16:22.105
sleeping one off in the hallway.

16:22.157 --> 16:24.040
Oh, God, your coat.

16:24.075 --> 16:25.425
O... okay... all right...

16:26.511 --> 16:28.027
Okay? Huh? All right.

16:29.414 --> 16:31.481
Mrs. Wheeler!

16:31.516 --> 16:33.450
Brad is coming, and he'll
be in here any minute!

16:33.485 --> 16:35.452
Oh, my God, oh, my God, what do I do?

16:35.454 --> 16:37.220
I don't know!

16:37.222 --> 16:39.255
Oh! Okay, here. Help! Cover him!

16:39.291 --> 16:42.142
Cover him up, cover him up,
cover him up, cover him up...

16:42.177 --> 16:43.276
- All right, come on, here we go.
- Okay...

16:43.311 --> 16:45.145
All right. Here
we... here we go.

16:45.197 --> 16:46.162
- All right, cover him.
- Oh, my God.

16:46.214 --> 16:47.213
- Tucker, help me.
- You're insane.

16:47.249 --> 16:49.132
- No, I am not.
- Move, move, move, move!

16:49.134 --> 16:50.150
Hurry...

16:50.202 --> 16:51.151
Bonnie!

16:53.088 --> 16:54.053
- Oh!
- Come here!

16:55.273 --> 16:58.458
You're home! Oh, my God,
this is... this is so exciting!

16:58.510 --> 17:00.009
We should go out and celebrate!

17:00.061 --> 17:01.995
What are you, crazy?
No! I just got back.

17:02.030 --> 17:03.279
I've been traveling for two days.

17:03.331 --> 17:05.381
All I wanna do is sit on the
couch and wrap myself in your arms.

17:05.383 --> 17:08.017
Okay, well, why don't you
just jump in the shower

17:08.053 --> 17:10.319
and we will just get right to that.

17:10.321 --> 17:11.421
- I've already showered.
- Oh! Okay, well,

17:11.473 --> 17:13.006
you know, you can never be too clean.

17:13.058 --> 17:16.242
You get started, and I will
come in and join you. Okay?

17:16.294 --> 17:17.292
Quarterback and towel girl?

17:17.329 --> 17:18.261
You don't have to tell me twice!

17:18.313 --> 17:20.230
Hut, hut! Oh, look at that ass!

17:20.232 --> 17:22.131
Oh, go long! Go long!

17:22.184 --> 17:24.549
Emma, let's get out of
here before the touchdown.

17:24.648 --> 17:25.698
You have to help me get him out of here.

17:25.750 --> 17:29.518
Grab his feet. Hi,
sweetie! I like your top!

17:29.554 --> 17:30.570
Okay. Malcolm!

17:30.605 --> 17:31.654
- Malcolm!
- Okay, I'll be right back.

17:31.689 --> 17:33.890
- Okay.
- Ready now?

17:33.892 --> 17:35.508
Here we go.

17:35.543 --> 17:38.778
Whee! Look at me! I'm Superman!

17:40.448 --> 17:41.414
Hey, Bon-Bon...

17:43.818 --> 17:45.735
Why is there a semi-conscious
man on your couch?

17:47.755 --> 17:51.591
Would you believe I found him in the
dryer with the rest of my laundry?

17:54.646 --> 17:55.695
What was that, Emma?

17:55.730 --> 17:58.564
Oh, you want some pancakes?
Okay, but you buying.

18:05.440 --> 18:08.457
Okay... here's the truth.

18:08.459 --> 18:11.527
You said that you met someone.

18:11.579 --> 18:13.512
I was devastated.

18:13.548 --> 18:16.482
And, you know, I thought
that going out would somehow

18:16.534 --> 18:18.801
make me feel better,
that we would be even.

18:18.836 --> 18:21.821
But it didn't, and I couldn't
even go through with it.

18:21.873 --> 18:24.857
Brad, sweetie, I am so sorry,
but we're fine, I swear...

18:24.892 --> 18:27.727
No, no, no, we are not fine, Bon-Bon.

18:27.762 --> 18:29.645
I can't believe that all it took

18:29.681 --> 18:32.581
was one phone call for
you to give up on us.

18:32.634 --> 18:35.534
If you can jump from happily
married to craven philanderer

18:35.570 --> 18:37.620
that quickly, then maybe we
don't have the kind of bond

18:37.622 --> 18:38.671
that I thought we did.

18:38.706 --> 18:41.524
- Brad, I love you.
- I'm sorry, Bonnie.

18:41.559 --> 18:43.492
I should've never left Peru.

18:51.903 --> 18:53.836
Oh, jeez.

18:53.871 --> 18:55.421
I should probably go call my wife.

18:55.473 --> 18:55.888
Okay.

19:00.745 --> 19:03.579
Oh, hey, babe. What are you doing up?

19:04.816 --> 19:06.732
Oh, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no...

19:06.768 --> 19:08.617
- You lied to me.
- Riley...

19:08.670 --> 19:11.604
You... you could've
just told me the truth.

19:11.639 --> 19:12.655
It was high school.

19:14.625 --> 19:18.527
I asked you if you had feelings for her,

19:18.529 --> 19:19.862
and you said, "No."

19:19.864 --> 19:21.430
"Not ever."

19:21.466 --> 19:23.516
- Just let me explain, please.
- No, no, no, Danny.

19:23.568 --> 19:25.401
There's nothing to explain.

19:25.453 --> 19:27.520
Here's your necklace.

19:27.555 --> 19:29.805
We don't have a someday anymore.

19:41.753 --> 19:43.836
Ben? Is something wrong?
It's the middle of the night.

19:43.888 --> 19:46.422
Absolutely nothing is wrong.

19:46.424 --> 19:47.757
It's all perfect. I
just couldn't see it.

19:47.809 --> 19:50.760
And... and I want you to
know I'm ready for this.

19:51.763 --> 19:54.814
For us, for me, you, Emma and Hunter.

19:54.849 --> 19:56.732
I want to be with you and no one else.

19:57.819 --> 19:58.901
Ben...

19:58.936 --> 20:00.770
Hey babe, everything okay?

20:02.774 --> 20:04.857
This is Aaron... Hunter's dad.

20:11.313 --> 20:13.230
Bonnie, I came back.

20:13.282 --> 20:14.281
I'm sorry I overreacted.

20:14.316 --> 20:16.900
I honestly cannot live without you.

20:18.287 --> 20:19.286
Bonnie?

20:21.907 --> 20:23.323
Anybody home?

20:23.375 --> 20:26.910
Brad! I'm here!

20:26.912 --> 20:28.328
I'll go to the ends of
the Earth to be with you!

20:28.380 --> 20:30.213
We are meant to be together!

20:31.416 --> 20:33.133
Brad?

20:34.303 --> 20:35.302
Anybody home?

20:37.422 --> 20:40.390
Ooh. Interesting.

20:40.425 --> 20:43.260
The floor outside is the
same as the floor inside.
