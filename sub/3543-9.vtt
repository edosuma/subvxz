WEBVTT

00:00.564 --> 00:03.716
Mystic Falls...
I was born here.

00:03.717 --> 00:05.019
This is my home.

00:05.020 --> 00:08.206
- And mine.
- And mine.

00:08.207 --> 00:11.125
For centuries, supernatural
creatures have lived among us.

00:11.126 --> 00:14.045
They were vampires,
werewolves, doppelgangers...

00:14.046 --> 00:15.580
- Witches.
- And even hybrids.

00:15.581 --> 00:19.250
Some search for a cure... Aah!

00:19.251 --> 00:20.988
No matter what
the consequences.

00:23.005 --> 00:24.439
Uh!

00:24.440 --> 00:26.068
Others plot a revolution.

00:26.069 --> 00:29.060
Do you want to be free?
We have to work together.

00:29.061 --> 00:30.697
And some try
to walk away.

00:30.698 --> 00:32.213
Elena's sired
to Damon.

00:32.214 --> 00:33.714
You don't think I'm going to
be able to do what I need to

00:33.715 --> 00:35.683
when I have to tell
Elena to stay away from me.

00:35.684 --> 00:36.768
I know what you're
about to do.

00:36.769 --> 00:38.269
Please, don't
do this to me.

00:38.270 --> 00:40.171
I'm not the good
guy, remember?

00:40.172 --> 00:41.792
I'm the
selfish one.

00:41.793 --> 00:44.474
But I have to do
the right thing by you.

00:46.000 --> 00:52.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:00.425 --> 01:04.045
This would be so much
more fun if we were naked.

01:04.046 --> 01:06.414
That was your call,
not mine.

01:06.415 --> 01:09.099
I was being
a gentleman.

01:11.135 --> 01:13.136
You shouldn't
have stayed.

01:14.472 --> 01:16.123
I know.

01:19.610 --> 01:22.447
I should have made you
leave, sent you packing.

01:22.448 --> 01:24.176
I promised Stefan.

01:24.650 --> 01:25.650
I know.

01:25.651 --> 01:27.101
You're sired to me,
Elena,

01:27.102 --> 01:28.936
which means everything
that you think you feel

01:28.937 --> 01:30.121
might not even
be real.

01:30.122 --> 01:36.011
I know, Damon, but...
It feels real.

01:36.012 --> 01:39.964
And I'm not ready
to let go of that.

01:39.965 --> 01:41.526
I could make you.

01:42.894 --> 01:44.571
Invoke the sire bond.

01:46.387 --> 01:47.991
So do it.

01:54.128 --> 01:56.931
I told him
I would set you free.

01:56.932 --> 02:00.368
Right after I didn't tell
him that we slept together.

02:00.369 --> 02:02.839
So, what do you
want to do?

02:05.106 --> 02:08.642
I want to throw you back in
my bed and never let you leave.

02:08.643 --> 02:10.430
So do it.

02:18.654 --> 02:21.441
Saved by
the cell phone.

02:23.875 --> 02:25.659
I have to meet
Bonnie.

02:25.660 --> 02:28.198
She's teaching Jeremy
how not to kill me.

02:35.686 --> 02:37.374
Want to come?

02:40.913 --> 02:45.839
<font color="#00ffff">Sync & corrections by Rafael UPD</font>
<font color="#00ffff">www.addic7ed.com/</font>

02:53.738 --> 02:55.856
Looks like
a giant snowflake.

02:55.857 --> 02:56.991
I prefer to think
of it

02:56.992 --> 02:59.678
as an expression
of post-modernism.

02:59.679 --> 03:01.796
It's my donation to
the winter wonderland

03:01.797 --> 03:03.413
charity event.

03:05.249 --> 03:06.884
You said it was
urgent?

03:06.885 --> 03:09.754
Yes. Take this to
the mystic grill immediately.

03:09.755 --> 03:12.373
You want me to be
a delivery guy?

03:12.374 --> 03:15.543
What I want is for you
to do whatever I say,

03:15.544 --> 03:17.164
without
the attitude.

03:21.409 --> 03:22.800
Be careful
with that.

03:22.801 --> 03:24.885
It's still wet.

03:24.886 --> 03:27.155
Abraham Lincoln freed the slaves,
you know.

03:27.156 --> 03:28.940
What is the point of
my hybrids being sired to me

03:28.941 --> 03:32.679
if I can't maximize on
the benefits of free labor?

03:33.195 --> 03:35.363
What are you
doing here?

03:35.364 --> 03:37.330
Elena is sired
to Damon.

03:37.883 --> 03:39.400
I intuited as much.

03:39.401 --> 03:41.419
Which means I need to find
the cure now more than ever,

03:41.420 --> 03:45.906
and here you are making
post-modern snowflakes.

03:45.907 --> 03:48.075
I've delivered.

03:48.076 --> 03:50.044
I retrieved the hunter's
sword from Italy,

03:50.045 --> 03:51.379
which we'll use
to decipher the map

03:51.380 --> 03:53.356
hidden in
the hunter's mark.

03:53.357 --> 03:55.302
You're the one who's supposed
to deliver the hunter

03:55.303 --> 03:56.384
and his mark.

03:56.385 --> 03:58.085
Well, Jeremy
is the hunter,

03:58.086 --> 03:59.920
and he has to keep killing
vampires to complete his mark,

03:59.921 --> 04:01.639
but we can't quite
figure out how

04:01.640 --> 04:03.474
to keep him
from killing us.

04:03.475 --> 04:05.059
Sounds like quite
the chore,

04:05.060 --> 04:06.760
which is why I feel
perfectly justified

04:06.761 --> 04:08.798
in doing a little
charity work.

04:09.281 --> 04:12.751
Or maybe you're lying about
having found the sword.

04:12.752 --> 04:15.013
Why would I lie
to you, Stefan?

04:15.653 --> 04:17.390
We're in this together.

04:25.963 --> 04:27.331
The hilt acts
as a cypher

04:27.332 --> 04:29.083
which we'll use
to decode the marks

04:29.084 --> 04:32.053
on Jeremy's tattoo when
he's killed enough vampires

04:32.054 --> 04:33.837
to complete it.

04:36.957 --> 04:39.644
I heard you moved
out of your house.

04:39.645 --> 04:42.930
Bit of a martyr
move, hmm?

04:42.931 --> 04:45.992
I'm not here
to bond, Klaus.

04:45.993 --> 04:48.161
Oh, on the contrary,

04:48.162 --> 04:50.321
I think right now
I'm the best friend you've got.

04:50.322 --> 04:52.857
I'm sick of taking his crap.

04:52.858 --> 04:54.376
I should rip
his throat off,

04:54.377 --> 04:56.160
see if he can boss us
around without a larynx.

04:56.161 --> 04:57.811
You won't have to
take it much longer.

04:57.812 --> 04:59.812
You keep saying that,
but here we are, hiding,

05:00.257 --> 05:02.250
plotting a revolution
that's never gonna happen.

05:02.251 --> 05:03.770
Never say never.

05:04.336 --> 05:07.555
And never say I
don't pull through.

05:07.556 --> 05:10.485
I found the witch that's
gonna save your lives.

05:10.926 --> 05:12.426
Are you serious?

05:15.046 --> 05:18.498
We promised you guys
we'd free you from Klaus.

05:18.901 --> 05:21.861
You did your part by
breaking your sire bond.

05:21.862 --> 05:23.623
Now Hayley and I
are going to do ours.

05:31.195 --> 05:33.013
You're going to
do what?

05:33.014 --> 05:34.515
Hayley found a witch
strong enough to do

05:34.516 --> 05:35.733
the body-jump
spell...

05:35.734 --> 05:37.502
You know,
the Klaus specialty.

05:37.503 --> 05:39.236
So you're going to put him
in someone else's body,

05:39.237 --> 05:40.755
and then what?

05:40.756 --> 05:42.290
We'll encase the body in concrete,
then bury it.

05:42.291 --> 05:44.024
Why not just desiccate
him like Bonnie did?

05:44.025 --> 05:45.042
Because to do
that spell,

05:45.043 --> 05:46.210
you have to stop
a human heart.

05:46.211 --> 05:47.695
I was a little
short of volunteers.

05:47.696 --> 05:49.196
Well, who was dumb enough
to volunteer their body

05:49.197 --> 05:50.942
to be a Klaus
sublet?

05:53.968 --> 05:54.969
Ok, don't freak out.

05:54.970 --> 05:56.311
Freak out?

05:56.312 --> 05:57.371
Freak out?

05:57.372 --> 05:58.706
I'm about to hemorrhage.
You volunteered?

05:58.707 --> 06:00.374
It's not forever,
just long enough

06:00.375 --> 06:02.393
for the hybrids to be able
to completely disappear.

06:02.394 --> 06:04.428
I can think of better ways for
us to spend our senior year

06:04.429 --> 06:07.314
than you buried
in concrete, Tyler.

06:11.662 --> 06:14.289
This started
with me.

06:14.290 --> 06:16.259
This has to end
with me.

06:18.544 --> 06:20.638
I need your support.

06:47.990 --> 06:49.490
Jeremy?

06:53.060 --> 06:55.872
They shouldn't
be here.

06:55.873 --> 06:59.167
They're here to
help you.

06:59.168 --> 07:01.267
Do you trust me?

07:05.156 --> 07:07.106
Yeah.

07:08.442 --> 07:10.126
Yeah, I trust you.

07:15.332 --> 07:17.884
Let's go inside.

07:23.974 --> 07:26.694
What the hell is Professor
Shadypants doing here?

07:26.695 --> 07:28.195
I invited him.

07:31.932 --> 07:33.601
Hey, listen.
We are ready to get started,

07:33.602 --> 07:36.853
but before we can do
that, we need her...

07:38.832 --> 07:41.419
In here.

07:41.420 --> 07:43.555
This is your house
now, Jer.

07:46.382 --> 07:48.059
You have to
invite me in.

07:54.288 --> 07:56.005
Go ahead, Jeremy.
Invite her in.

08:01.262 --> 08:02.866
You can come in.

08:32.527 --> 08:34.544
Hey. Sorry.
I know I'm late.

08:34.546 --> 08:36.046
If I'm gonna be a friend
in your time of need,

08:36.047 --> 08:38.030
then you need to work
on your punctuality.

08:38.032 --> 08:40.227
I'm in a crisis.
Where are you?

08:40.229 --> 08:42.052
I'm at my house.
Why? What's wrong?

08:42.053 --> 08:44.087
My boyfriend is a dumb-ass martyr.

08:44.089 --> 08:45.506
And why are you
at your house?

08:45.507 --> 08:46.557
Aren't you trying to
keep your distance

08:46.558 --> 08:47.984
from Elena?

08:47.985 --> 08:49.710
Well, she's not
here anymore.

08:49.711 --> 08:52.179
Damon took Jeremy to
the Gilbert lake house with Bonnie,

08:52.180 --> 08:54.264
so I guess her house
is safe for her again.

08:54.700 --> 08:56.517
Hey, listen, I got
Klaus to tell me

08:56.518 --> 08:58.886
a little bit more
about this hunter's sword.

08:58.887 --> 09:01.605
You know that map
in Jeremy's tattoo?

09:01.606 --> 09:03.890
The sword decodes it.

09:04.418 --> 09:06.410
It's literally the key
to finding the cure.

09:06.411 --> 09:07.795
Klaus told you this?

09:07.796 --> 09:10.164
Yeah. Why?

09:10.165 --> 09:13.766
And did he happen to hand over
the sword for safekeeping?

09:14.261 --> 09:15.845
Uh, what do you think?

09:18.006 --> 09:19.557
What's wrong?

09:19.558 --> 09:22.352
We need to get our hands
on that sword, like, today.

09:22.353 --> 09:23.427
Tyler
and his hybrids

09:23.428 --> 09:26.012
are taking out
Klaus tonight.

09:56.062 --> 09:58.805
Here to steal
tiny Tim's crutches?

09:58.806 --> 10:01.034
Dickens was
a dark man.

10:01.035 --> 10:04.538
You would have
liked him.

10:04.539 --> 10:06.771
Nice snowflake,
by the way.

10:06.772 --> 10:08.825
Is my work
really that literal?

10:08.826 --> 10:10.510
I'm serious.

10:10.511 --> 10:12.261
There's something...

10:13.580 --> 10:15.716
Lonely about it.

10:15.717 --> 10:18.409
I'm gonna take that
as a compliment.

10:18.410 --> 10:21.054
Can I offer you
some champagne?

10:21.055 --> 10:25.091
Can't. Too many
adult prying eyes.

10:25.092 --> 10:26.760
Don't want to be
a high-school cautionary tale

10:26.761 --> 10:28.145
at the next
town meeting.

10:28.146 --> 10:29.312
Well, then,
it's a good thing

10:29.313 --> 10:31.530
the high-school part
is nearly over.

10:34.934 --> 10:36.269
If we're gonna
be nice to each other,

10:36.270 --> 10:38.537
then I will need
that glass of champagne.

10:40.874 --> 10:43.610
Is that our thing?

10:43.611 --> 10:46.129
We don't have
a "thing."

10:46.130 --> 10:48.197
Allow me.

11:07.784 --> 11:09.469
Well, he's not
walking around with it.

11:09.470 --> 11:10.687
Check the rest
of the house.

11:10.688 --> 11:12.639
I am. I haven't
found anything.

11:12.640 --> 11:14.191
Try
the sock drawer.

11:14.192 --> 11:16.192
People leave the sketchiest
stuff in sock drawers.

11:16.633 --> 11:18.634
I'm gonna need
real ideas, Damon.

11:18.635 --> 11:22.815
Kill Tyler before he goes to Klaus,

11:23.223 --> 11:25.433
or, since Klaus has
suddenly become MVP

11:25.434 --> 11:26.944
in our relay race
for the cure,

11:27.505 --> 11:30.490
tell him about
the hybrids.

11:30.491 --> 11:32.158
Nobody's killing
Tyler.

11:33.844 --> 11:36.213
Hello?

11:36.214 --> 11:37.964
Stefan.

11:37.965 --> 11:39.299
Look, I know
it's a touchy subject,

11:39.300 --> 11:41.376
but do you know
where Elena is today?

11:43.804 --> 11:46.606
I think she's
running around...

11:46.607 --> 11:49.392
Trying to figure out
how to deprogram Jeremy.

11:49.393 --> 11:51.177
How'd she take it
last night...

11:51.178 --> 11:53.054
You telling her
to stay away from you?

11:54.731 --> 11:56.231
Not well.

11:56.667 --> 11:57.965
You ok?

11:57.966 --> 11:59.727
Peachy.

12:01.204 --> 12:03.990
Got to go. Bonnie's enlisted
Dr. Evil in her plan,

12:03.991 --> 12:06.242
and I have to
thwart him.

12:13.333 --> 12:15.552
All Jeremy feels
when he sees a vampire

12:15.553 --> 12:17.420
is a burning desire
to kill them.

12:17.421 --> 12:19.706
Even if consciously
he doesn't want to,

12:19.707 --> 12:23.407
as in your case, it's his
subconscious that's calling the shots.

12:23.408 --> 12:26.379
Persuasion helps
reverse your conscious thoughts.

12:26.380 --> 12:28.732
Think of it as kind of
a conditioned response, right?

12:28.733 --> 12:30.873
See vampire, kill vampire.

12:30.874 --> 12:33.436
What I'm doing is creating
a kind of middle step.

12:33.437 --> 12:37.023
It's like a detour
where his subconscious

12:37.024 --> 12:40.911
learns to recognize
you as someone he loves,

12:40.912 --> 12:43.279
someone he wants
to protect.

12:46.557 --> 12:49.252
And that gives him
a choice.

12:49.253 --> 12:52.088
He can choose
to take the detour

12:52.089 --> 12:54.790
instead of the
conditioned response.

12:56.149 --> 12:59.704
Ok. Talk to him.
He'll listen.

13:02.215 --> 13:04.851
I'm not...
Sure what to say.

13:04.852 --> 13:07.220
You chose to do this here at your
family's vacation house, right?

13:07.221 --> 13:09.755
So maybe just start
by telling him why.

13:12.392 --> 13:16.146
Every holiday,
we came here.

13:16.147 --> 13:18.806
This place
was family,

13:19.233 --> 13:22.101
and when
mom and dad died,

13:22.102 --> 13:23.904
Jenna made us
come here,

13:23.905 --> 13:26.957
and we thought it
was an awful idea,

13:26.958 --> 13:29.608
but it was like
they were here with us.

13:34.798 --> 13:37.742
They would have wanted us
to stick together, Jer...

13:40.303 --> 13:44.373
To fight for each
other no matter what.

13:48.728 --> 13:53.966
Jeremy, how do you feel
about Elena right now?

13:56.403 --> 14:00.240
She ruined our lives.
She's not even my real sister.

14:00.241 --> 14:03.507
She's just the reason that everyone
I've ever loved has died.

14:03.508 --> 14:05.008
She means
nothing to me.

14:05.427 --> 14:08.930
I will kill her,
even if that means I die myself.

14:14.004 --> 14:15.696
Did it work?

14:25.682 --> 14:26.683
Hey.

14:26.684 --> 14:27.890
Hey.

14:27.891 --> 14:30.034
- Did you find the sword?
- Nope.

14:30.035 --> 14:31.805
What are we
gonna do now?

14:31.806 --> 14:33.440
Klaus is the only shot
we have at finding the cure.

14:33.441 --> 14:35.958
We need him.
Tyler has to call it off.

14:36.394 --> 14:38.677
Well, that's
not gonna happen.

14:40.587 --> 14:42.949
You told him?

14:42.950 --> 14:46.686
I've had 12 hybrids sworn
to secrecy for a month.

14:46.687 --> 14:48.021
I have Hayley and a witch
risking their lives,

14:48.022 --> 14:49.823
and you're blabbing
my plan to him?

14:49.824 --> 14:52.640
Look, all I'm asking you for
is a little bit of time, ok?

14:52.641 --> 14:54.995
How long?
An hour? A day?

14:54.996 --> 14:56.413
Because every
minute that goes by

14:56.414 --> 14:58.364
that we don't do this,
they're at risk.

14:58.833 --> 15:00.083
You and Klaus already
served one of them up

15:00.084 --> 15:01.867
for Jeremy to kill.

15:07.173 --> 15:09.391
I don't owe you
anything.

15:11.394 --> 15:13.680
I'm taking
him out.

15:13.681 --> 15:16.622
I'm sorry,
but I can't let you do that.

15:16.623 --> 15:19.208
Stephan... I'm
sorry, but I can't.

15:19.209 --> 15:20.709
Stefan.

15:30.429 --> 15:34.108
Sorry, man,
but you don't have a choice.

15:43.066 --> 15:45.573
You're not allowed to feel
this sorry for yourself

15:45.574 --> 15:48.909
unless you're
sitting on a bar stool.

15:48.910 --> 15:52.213
Fortunately,
I travel with the bar.

15:52.214 --> 15:54.030
It didn't work.

15:55.583 --> 15:57.218
I shouldn't have
put so much hope

15:57.219 --> 16:00.037
into reprogramming
someone's mind.

16:00.038 --> 16:01.555
If it were
that easy,

16:01.556 --> 16:04.430
then you and I wouldn't
be in this situation.

16:06.010 --> 16:07.543
Right?

16:11.715 --> 16:13.067
Last time
I was here,

16:13.068 --> 16:15.719
I was so completely
in love with Stefan.

16:15.720 --> 16:18.976
Now that's barely
a memory.

16:18.977 --> 16:22.313
Is that
the sire bond...

16:22.314 --> 16:26.661
Or just that I'm so happy
to be here with you?

16:32.620 --> 16:35.571
Maybe there's something
else they can try.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.264
Tyler.

16:43.265 --> 16:45.132
Keep them down here until we're
ready to bring Klaus in.

16:45.133 --> 16:46.967
Use these if you have to.

16:46.968 --> 16:48.602
Come on, Tyler.
This is bigger than you.

16:48.603 --> 16:50.104
It's about more than
revenge for us.

16:50.105 --> 16:52.678
I know what it's about for you,
Stefan.

16:52.679 --> 16:54.091
It's about the cure.

16:54.092 --> 16:55.442
You know what happens to a hybrid

16:55.443 --> 16:57.427
when he's cured of being a vampire?

16:57.428 --> 16:58.979
We go back to
being werewolves,

16:58.980 --> 17:00.447
turning on every
full moon.

17:00.448 --> 17:02.783
We could give a rat's
ass about the cure.

17:02.784 --> 17:04.313
Tyler, come on.

17:04.314 --> 17:06.286
I needed you
on my side, care.

17:08.271 --> 17:09.771
That's all I wanted.

17:18.165 --> 17:20.634
You ok?

17:20.635 --> 17:23.082
Shane wants
to try again.

17:23.083 --> 17:25.422
Ehhh.

17:25.423 --> 17:27.958
Professor Shane has been
dipping into the magical herbs

17:27.959 --> 17:30.558
a little too much if
he thinks using a vampire

17:30.979 --> 17:32.980
to suppress the need
to kill another one

17:32.981 --> 17:34.481
is going to work
on a hunter.

17:34.482 --> 17:36.300
It's like dangling
a cheeseburger

17:36.301 --> 17:39.168
in front of someone
on a master cleanse.

17:41.939 --> 17:43.607
Just find someone else
to attach

17:43.608 --> 17:46.693
your warm and fuzzy
detour feelings to.

17:49.359 --> 17:51.998
Gee, I wonder
who that could be.

17:54.084 --> 17:55.818
You.

17:58.289 --> 18:00.046
I feel that way
about you.

18:03.844 --> 18:05.708
Well, this isn't
awkward at all.

18:05.709 --> 18:08.881
I'll be... anywhere else.

18:19.810 --> 18:21.178
It was good thinking
using Bonnie

18:21.179 --> 18:22.975
as Jeremy's emotional touchstone.

18:22.976 --> 18:25.848
Damon is very
intuitive.

18:27.234 --> 18:28.369
And Bonnie told me

18:28.370 --> 18:29.703
about your relationship with him.

18:29.704 --> 18:30.854
I don't mean
to pry, obviously.

18:30.855 --> 18:33.357
It's... complicated.

18:33.358 --> 18:34.959
Oh.

18:34.960 --> 18:37.333
Any ideas how to
hypnotize me out of it?

18:37.862 --> 18:39.196
You know, in all
my world travels,

18:39.197 --> 18:40.798
the one spell that I've never found

18:40.799 --> 18:43.412
is how to break somebody
from loving too much.

18:43.413 --> 18:44.913
Trust me,
I've looked.

18:47.972 --> 18:49.706
My wife and son died.

18:49.707 --> 18:53.758
I was just... I was trying to
figure out a way not to miss them.

18:56.261 --> 18:59.233
If your hypno-herbs work,

18:59.234 --> 19:02.603
we should be singing "Kumbaya"
around the fire by dinner.

19:02.604 --> 19:05.643
So now tell me why
I'm not killing you.

19:05.644 --> 19:06.991
Damon.

19:06.992 --> 19:09.156
I'm serious.
Why are you after the vampire cure?

19:09.611 --> 19:12.696
I didn't say I was
looking for the cure,

19:12.697 --> 19:14.664
but I can tell you
where to find it.

19:16.400 --> 19:18.447
Klaus' sword will
tell us where to find it.

19:18.448 --> 19:20.120
The sword will lead
you there, sure,

19:20.121 --> 19:21.306
but so can I.

19:21.307 --> 19:23.424
What?
How?

19:23.425 --> 19:25.089
Because I've already
been there.

19:28.213 --> 19:29.763
Instruct the guests to
drop their donations

19:29.764 --> 19:31.669
at the gift tree
in the grill.

19:31.670 --> 19:33.934
Yes, ma'am.

19:33.935 --> 19:35.419
Excuse me.

19:35.420 --> 19:37.021
There you are.

19:37.022 --> 19:40.807
Quick, a toast before
people can can judge us.

19:46.430 --> 19:47.930
What's wrong?

19:50.600 --> 19:52.601
Please say
something.

19:53.654 --> 19:57.041
But you'll miss
graduation.

19:57.042 --> 20:01.794
Which... I guess is a ridiculous
thing to worry about.

20:05.666 --> 20:08.372
I'm their Alpha.

20:08.373 --> 20:10.593
They're looking
to me to help them.

20:15.509 --> 20:18.812
You do what you
have to do, Tyler.

20:18.813 --> 20:19.980
Don't look so shocked.

20:19.981 --> 20:22.631
I'm trying to
channel your father.

20:25.602 --> 20:27.526
He'd be proud
of you, you know.

20:29.523 --> 20:32.475
You're a leader of people,
just like he was.

20:35.329 --> 20:36.829
Thank you, mom.

20:47.040 --> 20:48.078
It's a rock.

20:48.079 --> 20:49.872
It's not just any rock.

20:49.873 --> 20:52.379
Hmm. So is this
that silly little wives' tale

20:52.380 --> 20:53.964
that you told
at the occult exhibit?

20:53.965 --> 20:55.499
All right,
long story short...

20:55.500 --> 20:57.684
Once upon a time,
there was a witch named Silas

20:57.685 --> 21:01.505
who loved a girl and wanted
to be with her forever.

21:01.506 --> 21:03.724
So he and his best
friend, another witch,

21:03.725 --> 21:05.397
made an immortality
spell,

21:05.977 --> 21:08.891
and then Silas' best
friend witch got jealous

21:08.892 --> 21:12.348
and killed Silas' girl before he
had a chance to make her immortal.

21:13.772 --> 21:17.521
Well, cursed to an eternity
without his one true love,

21:17.522 --> 21:21.041
Silas finds a way to reverse
the immortality spell,

21:21.042 --> 21:23.659
and then,
before he has a chance to take it,

21:24.199 --> 21:26.001
his former friend
buries him underground,

21:26.564 --> 21:30.717
leaving him
and the cure to rot.

21:30.718 --> 21:33.459
So it's a cure
for immortality?

21:33.460 --> 21:38.392
Human blood is the life
force of an immortal.

21:38.393 --> 21:40.877
No more immortality,

21:40.878 --> 21:42.596
no more need
to feed on blood.

21:42.597 --> 21:47.884
You dig up Silas, and
you've got your cure.

21:51.226 --> 21:53.894
Oh,
this is ridiculous.

21:53.895 --> 21:55.609
We are not hostages.

21:55.610 --> 21:58.242
Sure you are,
sweetie.

22:01.332 --> 22:03.489
Relax.

22:03.490 --> 22:05.618
It's my brother.

22:06.615 --> 22:07.743
What's up?

22:07.744 --> 22:11.708
Don't ask how
or why or who,

22:11.709 --> 22:13.924
but I just found the answer
to your Tyler problem.

22:15.679 --> 22:19.800
You're kidding.

22:19.801 --> 22:21.301
We don't need the sword.

22:27.659 --> 22:28.777
This is the mark

22:28.778 --> 22:30.347
of the brotherhood
of the five.

22:30.348 --> 22:32.864
Then up the arm,
you have the murder

22:32.865 --> 22:35.477
of a girl by a witch.

22:35.478 --> 22:38.169
The symbols in the vines
are your map,

22:38.170 --> 22:39.955
which you obviously
no longer need.

22:39.956 --> 22:41.706
When this mark
is complete,

22:41.707 --> 22:43.675
it will contain
the spell that we need

22:43.676 --> 22:46.160
to dig up Silas.

22:46.161 --> 22:48.179
And where did you say
he was buried?

22:48.180 --> 22:51.299
Oh, I forgot.
You didn't.

22:51.300 --> 22:52.467
You've threatened
to kill me, what,

22:52.468 --> 22:54.087
like, 3 times
already this week?

22:54.088 --> 22:58.006
The location is how
I'm gonna survive your bad moods.

22:58.007 --> 23:00.041
And what's
in it for you?

23:00.042 --> 23:02.477
If not the cure,
then what?

23:02.478 --> 23:03.862
I'm in this for Silas,
all right?

23:03.863 --> 23:05.346
Up until this point,
he's only been myth.

23:05.347 --> 23:07.115
So write a thesis.

23:07.116 --> 23:09.517
Would you rather be the guy
who writes about Noah's ark

23:09.518 --> 23:11.786
or the one who sails it
down the Hudson river?

23:11.787 --> 23:12.988
I'm not buying it.

23:12.989 --> 23:14.072
You don't have to
buy anything.

23:14.073 --> 23:15.156
You just
have to believe

23:15.157 --> 23:16.658
that I can fix
your brother,

23:16.659 --> 23:17.742
and when his hunter's
mark is complete,

23:17.743 --> 23:19.877
I'm gonna take you
to the cure.

23:25.366 --> 23:26.801
How the hell
did you even get out?

23:26.802 --> 23:28.369
I got out because even
your idiot hybrids

23:28.370 --> 23:29.537
recognized
the stupidity

23:29.538 --> 23:31.089
of your Alpha hybrid
martyr plan.

23:31.090 --> 23:32.707
I'm not going to fight
with you anymore, Caroline.

23:32.708 --> 23:34.709
Oh, we're gonna do
plenty of fighting,

23:34.710 --> 23:35.727
the second that
you shove Klaus

23:35.728 --> 23:37.729
into someone
else's body.

23:37.730 --> 23:39.431
We've been through this.
I don't have anyone else's body.

23:39.959 --> 23:41.093
Yeah? Well, I do.

23:41.094 --> 23:43.680
What? Who?

23:44.686 --> 23:46.884
Klaus' sister
Rebekah.

23:46.885 --> 23:48.475
She's got a dagger
in her.

23:48.476 --> 23:50.427
Stefan's been hiding her
coffin in the tunnels.

23:50.428 --> 23:54.162
We dump Klaus into
her body and bury her.

23:54.163 --> 23:56.229
We just killed two original
birds with one stone.

23:56.643 --> 23:58.779
It's too late
to change the plans.

24:01.920 --> 24:02.954
Call Bonnie.

24:02.955 --> 24:03.955
Make sure it'll work.

24:03.956 --> 24:05.123
Tyler.

24:05.124 --> 24:08.376
It's a brilliant
plan, Hayley.

24:08.377 --> 24:09.628
You're a genius.
I love you.

24:09.629 --> 24:10.912
Ha!

24:10.913 --> 24:15.934
Mmm. I love you,
even when I hate you.

24:15.935 --> 24:17.251
I got to go find
my mom,

24:17.252 --> 24:19.303
let her know I might
actually graduate.

24:35.203 --> 24:36.770
How's it going?

24:37.267 --> 24:38.767
I think we're
making progress.

24:41.777 --> 24:42.827
Caroline, hey.

24:42.828 --> 24:44.329
Bonnie, I need you
to think fast.

24:44.330 --> 24:45.780
I know that the daggers
don't work on Klaus,

24:45.781 --> 24:48.299
but what if we put
his essence into Rebekah?

24:48.300 --> 24:49.801
It'll work, right?
Say it'll work.

24:49.802 --> 24:52.573
Slow down.
Slow down. What's happening?

24:52.574 --> 24:54.376
Just come on, Bonnie.
Will it work?

24:56.869 --> 24:58.870
Yeah. I don't see
why not.

24:58.871 --> 25:00.795
Oh. Bonnie
Bennett, I love you.

25:00.796 --> 25:02.374
Do you
need my help?

25:02.375 --> 25:04.849
I can leave Elena here with Jeremy.

25:04.850 --> 25:07.084
Elena? She's there, too?

25:07.589 --> 25:08.987
Yeah. She came
with Damon.

25:08.988 --> 25:11.489
Who's being slightly
less horrible than usual.

25:11.490 --> 25:13.887
You know what?
I can't deal with this right now.

25:18.663 --> 25:19.714
She said
it would work.

25:19.715 --> 25:21.435
I gathered.
Congratulations.

25:21.436 --> 25:22.936
Thank you.

25:26.671 --> 25:28.472
My pleasure.

25:33.333 --> 25:34.868
Jer and I

25:34.869 --> 25:36.235
should take these
decorations home with us.

25:36.236 --> 25:37.737
We could use
the holiday cheer.

25:37.738 --> 25:40.206
Look at you... suddenly
Polly optimist.

25:40.207 --> 25:42.742
I think Shane's
gonna get us through this.

25:42.743 --> 25:44.243
I trust him.

25:46.463 --> 25:48.338
Which you clearly don't.

25:48.339 --> 25:52.852
Maybe because I think he blew
up 12 people at the Young farm.

25:52.853 --> 25:53.970
What?

25:53.971 --> 25:55.772
A little tip,
Professor:

25:55.773 --> 25:57.924
I heard you before you
even took your first step.

25:57.925 --> 26:01.360
I see we're back to the false
accusation part of our relationship.

26:02.662 --> 26:04.096
What is he talking
about?

26:04.097 --> 26:06.098
Da... ha. Damon discovered
that I was in contact

26:06.099 --> 26:09.602
with pastor Young prior to
the explosion at the Young farm.

26:09.603 --> 26:11.437
The pastor was
severely depressed.

26:11.438 --> 26:14.707
He had lost his wife
to cancer,

26:14.708 --> 26:19.495
and he sought me out for
a little supernatural assistance.

26:22.165 --> 26:24.150
I tried to help,
but he was too far gone.

26:24.151 --> 26:27.219
It's just I never expected that
he'd take 11 innocents with him.

26:29.139 --> 26:30.639
Elena.

26:32.475 --> 26:35.425
It's ok.

26:35.426 --> 26:37.010
I think we've got this.

26:37.011 --> 26:39.516
Elena,
don't move, ok?

26:39.517 --> 26:41.183
No matter what.

26:45.937 --> 26:49.658
Jeremy, remember
the detour.

26:50.066 --> 26:51.577
Choose the right path.

28:04.434 --> 28:06.768
She doesn't
like me much.

28:07.937 --> 28:09.489
Where have you
been all day?

28:09.490 --> 28:11.229
I've been around.

28:11.230 --> 28:13.392
I'm not interested
in vagaries, Stefan.

28:13.393 --> 28:15.227
You've been dodgy
and Caroline's been lovely,

28:15.228 --> 28:17.247
which I've come to recognize
as a tool of distraction.

28:17.248 --> 28:20.566
Now do you have something
to share with me,

28:20.567 --> 28:23.335
or should I compel
it out of you?

28:25.455 --> 28:28.841
I broke into your safe
to look for the sword.

28:28.842 --> 28:30.415
Why?

28:30.416 --> 28:31.916
Because I don't
trust you.

28:33.079 --> 28:34.714
I showed you
the sword.

28:34.715 --> 28:36.082
I explained
its value.

28:36.083 --> 28:37.967
I've been on your side
the entire time.

28:37.968 --> 28:39.135
What do you want
from me...

28:39.136 --> 28:41.395
A secret brotherhood
handshake?

28:43.523 --> 28:45.757
I found the letters.

28:47.277 --> 28:50.029
You have a few pen pals
over the centuries?

28:50.030 --> 28:52.815
Well, is keeping my victims'
letters really so different

28:52.816 --> 28:56.119
from writing their
names on a wall,

28:56.120 --> 29:00.989
like you did, ripper?

29:17.640 --> 29:21.010
Loneliness, Stefan.

29:21.011 --> 29:25.264
That's why you and I
memorialize our dead.

29:25.265 --> 29:27.100
There's the briefest
of moments before we kill

29:27.101 --> 29:30.853
where we literally hold
their life in our hands,

29:30.854 --> 29:33.856
and then we
rip it away,

29:33.857 --> 29:36.826
and we're left
with nothing.

29:36.827 --> 29:38.310
So gathering other
people's letters

29:38.311 --> 29:39.529
or writing their names
on a wall...

29:39.530 --> 29:41.998
It's a reminder...

29:41.999 --> 29:44.500
That in the end
we're left infinitely

29:44.501 --> 29:47.669
and utterly alone.

29:56.379 --> 29:58.164
Oh. Sorry.

29:58.165 --> 30:01.099
Oh. Hello?
Are you ok?

30:02.501 --> 30:04.269
Um...

30:06.804 --> 30:09.733
Oh, my gosh!
Caroline!

30:13.144 --> 30:17.682
Oh! Somebody help! Help!

30:18.868 --> 30:19.869
Holy crap!

30:19.870 --> 30:21.686
Have you seen Hayley?

30:25.573 --> 30:27.324
You didn't
have a pulse.

30:27.325 --> 30:29.028
You were dead.

30:29.029 --> 30:30.413
Stefan, it's me.

30:30.414 --> 30:32.749
That little werewolf
slut has lost her mind.

30:32.750 --> 30:34.083
Go to the Lockwood
cellar and make sure

30:34.084 --> 30:35.367
that Rebekah body
is still there.

30:35.368 --> 30:36.552
I'm gonna find Tyler.

30:36.553 --> 30:38.254
Hayley is trying to
screw this up.

30:45.061 --> 30:47.313
Forget everything
you just saw and heard.

30:47.314 --> 30:48.547
You are miss Mystic Falls,

30:48.548 --> 30:51.984
and you have duties
to fulfill.

30:51.985 --> 30:54.069
Ok.

31:04.447 --> 31:05.581
There you are.

31:05.582 --> 31:06.949
Stefan has been
looking for you.

31:06.950 --> 31:08.534
Adrian's leading
Klaus to the cellar.

31:08.535 --> 31:09.952
How come the only
time April Young

31:09.953 --> 31:11.570
isn't following you
around like a lost puppy

31:11.571 --> 31:14.841
is when I'm lying dead
with a broken neck?

31:14.842 --> 31:16.456
April saw you?

31:16.457 --> 31:18.333
Yeah. It's ok.
I compelled her.

31:18.334 --> 31:21.503
She's... she's wearing
Jeremy's vervain bracelet.

31:21.504 --> 31:23.598
She can't be
compelled.

31:25.601 --> 31:29.980
Hey, mom.
I don't see you.

31:30.390 --> 31:34.760
Things have changed.
It's gonna be fine.

31:34.761 --> 31:36.262
I'll be back later.
I'll pick you up.

31:36.263 --> 31:37.897
What are you
doing here?

31:37.898 --> 31:40.116
You're supposed to be taking
the witch to the cellar.

31:40.117 --> 31:42.649
There is no witch,
Tyler.

31:42.650 --> 31:44.236
What?

31:44.237 --> 31:45.902
I made it up.

31:46.873 --> 31:48.124
Where the hell is the witch?

31:48.125 --> 31:49.659
Adrian should
be here any minute.

31:51.829 --> 31:52.829
Kim.

31:52.830 --> 31:53.946
Uh!

31:53.947 --> 31:55.620
No!

31:55.621 --> 31:57.500
I never intended
for you to put Klaus down.

31:57.501 --> 32:00.542
I needed him
for the sacrifice.

32:00.543 --> 32:02.043
What?

32:06.625 --> 32:07.760
I don't know
how to explain it,

32:07.761 --> 32:09.145
but I made a deal
with someone

32:09.146 --> 32:11.179
who can help me
find my family.

32:11.180 --> 32:13.298
What are you talking about?
What kind of deal?

32:13.806 --> 32:16.902
There needed to be 12
for the sacrifice, Tyler.

32:19.603 --> 32:21.156
12 what?

32:22.909 --> 32:26.026
I'm sorry.

32:26.027 --> 32:29.164
Hayley, what
did you do?

32:29.613 --> 32:33.586
If you run now,
you might make it out alive.

33:07.610 --> 33:09.237
Where is Tyler
Lockwood?

33:10.613 --> 33:12.958
You'd do well
to answer me, love.

33:15.044 --> 33:16.586
Where is he?!

33:19.830 --> 33:21.366
I don't know.

33:22.218 --> 33:24.052
Wrong answer.

33:46.214 --> 33:47.683
Check this out.

33:47.684 --> 33:50.495
Jenna used that to
make out with Logan fell.

34:15.076 --> 34:18.398
All the drama, and you're
missing the actual fun part.

34:22.417 --> 34:25.905
Elena, we can't.
I can't.

34:30.192 --> 34:33.444
Damon, you can't keep telling
me that this isn't real.

34:35.364 --> 34:39.284
I know how I feel
and that you feel it, too,

34:39.284 --> 34:40.920
so stop fighting it.

34:48.777 --> 34:51.330
It's good to see you
like that...

34:51.331 --> 34:54.184
All normal
with your brother.

34:55.801 --> 34:57.785
I want that again
for you.

35:00.889 --> 35:02.925
Christmas was always mine
and Stefan's favorite holiday

35:02.926 --> 35:08.730
when we were kids,
not that I've celebrated since.

35:08.731 --> 35:10.565
I kind of miss that.

35:10.566 --> 35:12.884
You're thinking about
how upset he'll be

35:12.885 --> 35:15.637
when he finds out that you
and I are together.

35:15.638 --> 35:16.939
I've been lying
to him all day.

35:16.940 --> 35:18.607
No. You were helping me
with Jeremy.

35:18.608 --> 35:19.908
The point is not
what I was doing.

35:19.909 --> 35:21.878
The point is
that I'm here with you.

35:22.412 --> 35:24.529
I was supposed to invoke
the sire bond, Elena,

35:24.530 --> 35:26.206
send you away.

35:26.207 --> 35:27.983
I was supposed to do
the right thing by you

35:27.984 --> 35:30.368
and the right thing
by my brother.

35:32.153 --> 35:34.349
Which is what
I'm gonna do right now.

35:37.459 --> 35:39.177
You're gonna
go home.

35:39.178 --> 35:40.328
What? No. Damon...

35:40.329 --> 35:41.713
I'm gonna stay
here with Jeremy.

35:41.714 --> 35:42.798
I'm gonna help him
complete the mark.

35:42.799 --> 35:44.309
I'll teach him
how to hunt.

35:44.310 --> 35:47.335
I'll protect him,
and we'll kill vampires

35:47.336 --> 35:48.728
without you.

35:48.729 --> 35:51.473
Damon, please.

35:51.474 --> 35:53.368
I'm setting you
free, Elena.

35:55.402 --> 35:57.161
This is what I want.

35:59.231 --> 36:01.732
This is what
will make me happy.

36:07.706 --> 36:11.126
I can't find April.
I can't reach Tyler.

36:11.127 --> 36:13.461
This is a disaster.

36:16.531 --> 36:18.000
Is this you
in crisis mode?

36:18.001 --> 36:20.728
Because it's a lot more
stealth than mine.

36:22.387 --> 36:24.205
I thought I'd be
happier

36:24.206 --> 36:28.643
watching Klaus get led
away to the slaughter,

36:28.644 --> 36:31.746
but for some reason,
I can't help but feel kind of...

36:33.048 --> 36:35.650
Guilty.

36:35.651 --> 36:37.551
Yeah. You and me both.

36:38.754 --> 36:40.072
All day I've been
trying to remind myself

36:40.073 --> 36:42.457
of all the horrible
things he's done.

36:42.458 --> 36:43.725
See, that's
the thing.

36:43.726 --> 36:47.029
We've all done
horrible things.

36:47.030 --> 36:48.113
And I'm sitting here
trying to figure out

36:48.114 --> 36:53.376
what makes us
any better than him.

36:53.377 --> 36:56.014
And I think it's just
that we have family we can trust.

36:58.340 --> 36:59.957
Yeah.

37:02.410 --> 37:04.746
You're right, Stefan.

37:04.747 --> 37:07.932
Trust is everything.

37:10.469 --> 37:13.455
Have you heard
from Damon?

37:13.456 --> 37:16.825
Yeah. He's still with
Jeremy at the lake house.

37:16.826 --> 37:22.363
Did he happen to mention...
Where Elena was?

37:25.484 --> 37:28.671
Wait. Why are you... why
are you asking me this?

37:33.492 --> 37:36.012
They're together,
aren't they?

37:43.785 --> 37:46.187
How together
are they?

37:51.543 --> 37:55.396
Caroline, tell me.

37:58.233 --> 38:00.401
How together
are they?

38:16.502 --> 38:18.002
Thank you.

38:44.563 --> 38:46.064
I was ready to
fight you on this,

38:46.065 --> 38:49.201
but suddenly every
part of my body

38:49.202 --> 38:51.019
is telling me
that I need to get in this car

38:51.020 --> 38:52.520
and leave you.

38:55.740 --> 38:57.760
So do it.

40:35.924 --> 40:40.770
Tyler, honey, you're supposed
to be in my sober cab.

40:40.771 --> 40:43.297
I think I drank
half the party.

40:48.153 --> 40:50.054
Good evening, Carol.

40:52.440 --> 40:55.026
If you're looking
for Tyler,

40:55.027 --> 40:58.646
I'd like a little
word with him myself.

40:58.647 --> 41:01.082
Klaus, please.

41:01.083 --> 41:04.085
Don't hurt him.

41:04.086 --> 41:06.487
He's my son.

41:06.488 --> 41:08.714
He's all I have.

41:08.715 --> 41:11.185
And you're all
he has.

41:13.328 --> 41:16.941
There's a beautiful symmetry
to that, don't you think?

41:19.000 --> 41:20.684
Aah!
