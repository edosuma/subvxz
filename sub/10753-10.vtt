WEBVTT

00:09.849 --> 00:11.805
I had to get out of the house.

00:12.061 --> 00:15.098
Maris's Junior League is rehearsing
their spring musical "Cats".

00:16.318 --> 00:20.914
I've been watching two dozen
underweight women in leotards

00:21.285 --> 00:23.241
crawling around the room meowing.

00:24.623 --> 00:29.743
- My allergies are acting up.
- You're exaggerating.

00:30.133 --> 00:32.522
No. The experience is very vivid.

00:32.803 --> 00:35.636
As God is my judge,
I swear Mrs Presley-Bismuth

00:35.933 --> 00:38.527
was scent-marking the divan.

00:40.274 --> 00:43.072
Women that age should know better -

00:43.363 --> 00:45.877
remember "The Sound Of Music"?

00:46.159 --> 00:50.072
Half the von Trapp children
were having hot flashes.

00:50.416 --> 00:53.135
Hi, Frasier, Niles.

00:53.421 --> 00:55.651
The wacky gang from the office?

00:55.925 --> 00:59.235
My brother, Niles.
Teddy, our engineer.

00:59.556 --> 01:02.070
Teddy, my man.

01:04.480 --> 01:08.315
This is KACL's own Chopper Dave,
your eye in the sky for traffic!

01:08.655 --> 01:12.125
(Shouts) Nice to meet you, Niles!

01:12.452 --> 01:17.321
- Why is he yelling?
- Oh, God, I was yelling again.

01:17.710 --> 01:23.228
I'm sorry, talking over the blades,
you know! Whoop, whoop, whoop!

01:23.637 --> 01:26.549
This has been kind of fun.
But I really have to go.

01:26.851 --> 01:29.365
I'm conducting a seminar
on multiple personalities

01:29.647 --> 01:33.720
and it takes forever
to fill out the name tags.

01:41.917 --> 01:45.227
Well, KACL team,
what is on the agenda for today?

01:45.549 --> 01:51.499
I've got a juicy piece of news.
And it's reliable:

01:51.934 --> 01:54.129
Alan in Accounting got it
from Stephen in Promotions,

01:54.396 --> 01:57.388
who got it
from the manager's secretary.

01:57.693 --> 02:02.403
The station is way over budget
and somebody's getting the axe.

02:02.786 --> 02:05.983
But don't tell anybody.
I was sworn to secrecy.

02:06.291 --> 02:13.163
Gossip sullies good people's names
and creates suspicion and mistrust!

02:13.637 --> 02:17.949
Gossip is the lifeblood
of the corporate world!

02:18.311 --> 02:22.827
If it wasn't for gossip, we wouldn't
know how much everybody makes.

02:23.194 --> 02:25.469
You know my salary?

02:25.740 --> 02:28.095
(Shouts) No one's salary's a secret!

02:28.369 --> 02:31.520
94, 95, 96, 97,

02:31.834 --> 02:34.712
..98, 99, 100! New high for me!

02:35.005 --> 02:37.599
Squeezing or counting?

02:39.763 --> 02:42.038
(Barks) Java to go!

02:42.685 --> 02:46.883
(Shouts) Father Mike from "Religion On
The Line" is getting dumped!

02:47.234 --> 02:50.385
No! Station just gave him a bonus.

02:51.700 --> 02:55.534
Hey, where's my tickets
to the "Sonics" game?

02:55.873 --> 03:00.742
(Shouts) Somebody stole my tickets
to the "Sonics" game! That stinks!

03:01.132 --> 03:03.441
This is... Oh, got 'em, got 'em.

03:07.809 --> 03:10.881
You don't think
Bulldog's getting canned?

03:11.190 --> 03:13.146
Could be.

03:13.402 --> 03:15.472
He's our top personality,

03:15.864 --> 03:19.459
except for women 35 to 54
who think that I'm sort of a God.

03:20.830 --> 03:23.060
But he complained about his salary.

03:23.335 --> 03:26.725
He screamed about
having his expense account on hold.

03:27.049 --> 03:29.768
- (Shouts) Oh, yeah, bulldog's out!
- Shh!

03:32.099 --> 03:35.455
Have you heard
my new gimmick for the show?

03:35.772 --> 03:40.004
If the Seahawks beat Buffalo,
I'll do my show hanging by my feet.

03:40.363 --> 03:42.319
You can do that?!

03:42.575 --> 03:46.773
Oh, sure. The real trick is drinking
coffee. I keep burning my eyes.

03:48.167 --> 03:51.204
Want my tickets to the Sonics game?

03:51.506 --> 03:54.145
(Shouts) Thanks!
Why aren't you going?

03:54.427 --> 03:57.703
Station manager
wants to see me after work.

03:58.726 --> 04:00.956
You're jumping to conclusions.

04:01.231 --> 04:03.870
Bulldog has devoted 15 years to radio

04:04.152 --> 04:06.985
He shouldn't become the object

04:07.283 --> 04:11.196
of some scurrilous rumour that,
as yet, hasn't a shred of truth to it.

04:11.539 --> 04:13.734
I suppose you're right.

04:14.002 --> 04:17.517
Just in case,
I've got dibs on his parking space.

04:22.015 --> 04:26.964
We have Don on his car phone.
He's having a weight problem.

04:28.442 --> 04:30.956
Don, it's a common problem.
I'm listening.

04:31.238 --> 04:37.711
'l eat healthy, I work out,
but I can't lose a pound.'

04:38.167 --> 04:42.206
Losing weight is a struggle,
it takes a commitment.

04:42.549 --> 04:45.143
If you're ready to accept that,
I could suggest...

04:45.428 --> 04:47.988
(Girl's voice)
'May I take your order, please?'

04:52.982 --> 04:57.737
- Don, what was that?'
- Oh, it was the radio.'

04:58.116 --> 05:01.745
- Don, where are you?
- 'I'm just driving around.'

05:02.081 --> 05:05.790
(Girl's voice)
'Please speak into the clown's mouth.'

05:07.632 --> 05:13.628
(Don fakes static noises)
'I'm going into a tunnel! Bye!'

05:14.059 --> 05:16.095
Yes, and the light
at the end of that tunnel

05:16.354 --> 05:19.551
is a heat lamp
over a large order of fries.

05:21.697 --> 05:24.495
We'll be right back after the news.

05:24.785 --> 05:28.380
- I got to run up to Payroll.
- OK.

05:30.253 --> 05:31.606
Oh, hi, Father Mike.

05:31.839 --> 05:34.034
Oh, hello, Frasier.

05:34.301 --> 05:38.180
I heard a rumour
that somebody is being let go.

05:38.516 --> 05:42.031
Do you know anything?
I'm afraid it might be me.

05:42.355 --> 05:45.711
Don't put any stock in office gossip.

05:46.029 --> 05:49.817
I know, but my numbers
have been down lately.

05:50.160 --> 05:53.277
They keep changing my time slot.
I'm really bummed!

05:56.170 --> 06:00.482
I don't like to engage in gossip
but you have nothing to worry about.

06:00.844 --> 06:01.993
Why?

06:02.221 --> 06:07.170
Someone is being let go.
It's not you, it's Bulldog.

06:07.564 --> 06:11.159
Bulldog? Oh, what a shame.

06:11.487 --> 06:13.318
Has anybody spoken for
his parking space?

06:13.574 --> 06:16.008
I have.

06:20.835 --> 06:22.871
So I'm a goner, huh?

06:25.593 --> 06:27.185
Bulldog, how long have you been...?

06:27.430 --> 06:29.466
I know I'm out.

06:30.519 --> 06:34.034
I knew it, I knew it, I knew it!
Damn it!

06:36.445 --> 06:39.482
Ned Miller wants to see me
to can my butt!

06:39.784 --> 06:43.493
Why would he miss happy hour
at "El Paquino's"? He's a boozer!

06:43.832 --> 06:47.347
This is just a rumour.

06:47.672 --> 06:50.425
After all I've done for this station!

06:50.719 --> 06:53.631
This is how they repay me?
No, I'll quit first!

06:53.932 --> 06:57.686
Now, don't do anything rash.
Try to vent your anger first.

07:04.158 --> 07:07.195
Well, good. Way to go.
Now, on your way.

07:07.496 --> 07:09.487
You're damn right!

07:11.002 --> 07:12.355
Hey, Bulldog.

07:12.588 --> 07:15.421
No time to talk, Slim!
I'm off to war!

07:18.014 --> 07:20.847
- Ugh!
- Wait for me!

07:24.358 --> 07:26.826
- What was that?
- He's quitting.

07:27.111 --> 07:29.500
- Why?
- Because Ned Miller is firing him.

07:29.783 --> 07:31.933
- Who told you that?
- You did.

07:32.204 --> 07:34.638
That was just a rumour.
You didn't tell him?!

07:34.917 --> 07:38.910
- He overheard me.
- Oh, God!

07:39.256 --> 07:43.135
You guys were so positive!
The meeting tonight...

07:43.472 --> 07:47.624
It was to discuss taking his show
national! Don't you know anything?

07:47.980 --> 07:50.858
Apparently not!

07:51.151 --> 07:53.665
Go call his secretary!
She can stop him!

07:53.948 --> 07:56.860
I don't believe it.
This is incredible!

07:57.245 --> 08:03.036
Arlene? Bob Brisco's about to jump
into the office... Oh, he did?

08:05.008 --> 08:09.047
He's already burst into the office
with Miller. God, this is a disaster!

08:10.141 --> 08:13.975
Maybe before he starts, Miller will
tell him what the meeting was about.

08:14.314 --> 08:18.830
You're right. They may be having
a good laugh about this right now.

08:19.197 --> 08:21.631
(Growls)

08:23.913 --> 08:26.268
We're on in one minute!

08:26.543 --> 08:29.262
(Shouts) I did it!
I scorched him!

08:30.257 --> 08:34.409
I told him his wife came on to me
at the Christmas party,

08:34.765 --> 08:39.236
but no amount of liquor would
make me sleep with that porker!

08:39.607 --> 08:42.565
- You said that to Ned Miller?
- Yeah, he even took a swing at me.

08:42.861 --> 08:44.978
But I gave him a little okey-doke!

08:45.240 --> 08:48.357
My God, the man tried to strike you?

08:48.662 --> 08:53.292
No sudden moves. I'm too pumped.
I feel like popping someone!

08:53.671 --> 08:58.028
He has quit because of
a rumour you spread!

08:58.388 --> 09:00.982
ME?!

09:01.267 --> 09:04.145
The point of gossip
is to talk behind the person's back!

09:04.439 --> 09:06.589
You're unclear on this concept?!

09:08.947 --> 09:12.098
I'm a bad, bad man.

09:13.663 --> 09:18.783
You've got to call Ned Miller
and get this whole thing cleared up.

09:19.171 --> 09:23.642
The man is unstable. He took a swing
at me the day he hired me.

09:25.598 --> 09:28.874
(Shouts) I just heard a hot rumour!
Bulldog quit!

09:29.188 --> 09:32.942
(Shouts) Keep it under your hat,
Very Hush hush!

09:35.115 --> 09:38.630
(Doorbell)

09:38.954 --> 09:41.548
Oh, Niles, what brings you here?

09:41.834 --> 09:45.270
I was hoping Daphne
could take a look at this plant.

09:49.305 --> 09:53.218
I bought it for Maris but it,
unaccountably, turned against her.

09:55.315 --> 09:58.352
I thought Daphne
could nurse it back to health

09:58.653 --> 10:02.123
with her soft, sensual hands
and her loving...manner.

10:02.451 --> 10:04.840
Is she here?

10:05.122 --> 10:08.512
- She stepped out.
- Oh, well, I'm off.

10:08.836 --> 10:12.795
Wait! You can stay. We can visit.

10:13.135 --> 10:17.526
Oh. Well, yes, we could,
couldn't we?

10:19.000 --> 10:25.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:26.491 --> 10:29.005
- So how are you?
- Fine. You?

10:29.287 --> 10:31.243
Fine.

10:33.753 --> 10:35.948
She's fine.

10:41.808 --> 10:45.039
- Pickle?
- No, thanks.

10:54.871 --> 10:57.510
If you just came to see Daphne,
you don't have to stay.

10:57.792 --> 11:01.671
How can you say that?
I am insulted!

11:02.049 --> 11:06.247
I wanted to have some time with you
but now I'm so upset I have to leave.

11:08.143 --> 11:11.977
- Hello. Staying for dinner?
-Yes, love to.

11:13.861 --> 11:18.173
Could you coax this back to life?
It's Maris's favourite.

11:19.244 --> 11:22.714
- What did she do to it?
- Nothing, just loved it.

11:24.504 --> 11:26.460
What weather!

11:27.299 --> 11:31.338
- What happened to Bulldog?
- Who told you?

11:31.681 --> 11:34.912
I just tuned into
the gonzo sports show today

11:35.230 --> 11:38.540
and they had Father Mike
filling in. I hate that!

11:38.860 --> 11:43.138
All it was was "Notre Dame,
Notre Dame, Notre Dame."

11:45.956 --> 11:47.992
Bulldog tendered his resignation.

11:48.251 --> 11:51.641
Oh, no! Why?
He's the top sports guy in town.

11:51.965 --> 11:56.641
It's a tough business,
this radio game.

11:57.015 --> 11:59.575
I'm picking up something from you.

11:59.854 --> 12:01.924
You're shrouded in an aura of guilt.

12:07.533 --> 12:09.285
Maybe I am.

12:09.536 --> 12:12.255
That's fantastic! Do me, do me!

12:15.671 --> 12:19.346
No, I'm onto something here.

12:19.677 --> 12:23.352
You think you're responsible
for Bulldog losing his job!

12:23.684 --> 12:25.481
Frasier?

12:25.729 --> 12:29.358
I was repeating a rumour
that Bulldog was going to get sacked.

12:29.694 --> 12:34.893
He overheard me, blew up, quit his job.

12:35.287 --> 12:40.680
The rumour wasn't true. Of course,
you already knew that, didn't you?

12:41.672 --> 12:42.627
(Phone)

12:42.841 --> 12:45.435
Oh, excuse me.

12:46.472 --> 12:48.702
Hello? Maris...

12:48.976 --> 12:51.331
Maris, what's wrong? Oh, pumpkin.

12:52.482 --> 12:55.076
No, no, everything's going to be...
Oh, dear.

12:55.362 --> 13:00.197
I have to go. Maris is despondent.
They kicked her out of "Cats".

13:00.578 --> 13:02.375
Why?

13:02.623 --> 13:04.853
She couldn't remember
the words to "Memory".

13:09.885 --> 13:13.594
If you are responsible
for getting Bulldog sacked,

13:13.934 --> 13:16.687
you must go to his boss
and get him his job back.

13:16.981 --> 13:21.975
Ned Miller's the most
mean-spirited man I've ever met.

13:22.364 --> 13:24.514
And he cheats on his wife.

13:25.786 --> 13:27.822
My goodness, I'm on today!

13:29.835 --> 13:33.794
So you're selling Bulldog
down the river?

13:34.134 --> 13:36.568
This might be for the best.

13:36.847 --> 13:40.396
He thinks he should be in a larger
market, like LA or New York and...

13:41.646 --> 13:44.956
Eddie, scoot, scat!

13:47.363 --> 13:50.002
- Bulldog?
- Hiya, doc.

13:50.285 --> 13:52.753
Why are you just standing there?

13:53.040 --> 13:57.909
I was trying to decide
whether or not I should bother you.

13:58.299 --> 14:01.450
My life is kind of over,
but you got company...

14:01.763 --> 14:05.358
No, no, come in. It's just family.

14:05.685 --> 14:07.880
This is my dad and Daphne Moon.

14:08.148 --> 14:11.618
Hey, Bulldog!
You're soaking wet.

14:11.946 --> 14:15.939
- I've been wandering the streets.
- I heard what happened.

14:16.286 --> 14:20.325
You haven't heard the half of it.
And my girlfriend threw me out.

14:21.796 --> 14:25.994
She said she was only with me
because I was on the radio.

14:26.345 --> 14:29.781
Eight years we've been together.

14:30.644 --> 14:34.080
Even when I was tomcatting around,
I loved that woman.

14:35.777 --> 14:37.893
God! That job was my life,
and now I've been blackballed

14:38.155 --> 14:41.670
in this business
because of my stupid temper.

14:41.996 --> 14:43.907
What is this, anyway?

14:44.165 --> 14:49.239
That's a rare fertility symbol from
a small nomadic tribe in Ghana.

14:49.633 --> 14:53.228
When they passed out equipment,
this guy was in the back of the line.

14:54.975 --> 14:58.888
I might as well face it.
I'm just a loser, I'm a zero,

14:59.232 --> 15:02.861
- I'm nothing, a has-been.
- Pickle?

15:10.334 --> 15:15.203
Mr Crane often puts off his nightly
bath just so he can hear your show.

15:15.593 --> 15:19.791
You're the greatest! If it wasn't for you,
I wouldn't have a radio.

15:20.142 --> 15:22.975
That's a nice thing to say.

15:23.272 --> 15:26.389
Now I know why your son
is such a great guy.

15:32.162 --> 15:34.835
Hey, I bothered you people enough.
I better go.

15:35.124 --> 15:37.433
The good rooms at the "Y" fill up early.

15:41.427 --> 15:45.181
Wait, Bulldog.
I can't let you leave like this.

15:47.729 --> 15:49.924
Here's a 20.

15:52.862 --> 15:58.380
Oh, all right. Why don't you just
spend the night? Take the couch.

15:58.789 --> 16:01.906
- You'd do that for me?
- Why have a priceless couch

16:02.211 --> 16:04.327
unless you've got
people crashing on it?

16:07.011 --> 16:10.367
- Thanks.
- I could use a hot shower.

16:10.684 --> 16:14.996
- Oh, sure.
- Down the hall, second door left.

16:24.080 --> 16:27.675
You two just leave me alone.
This is not my fault.

16:28.004 --> 16:32.714
I am not responsible for him going
up there and popping off to the boss.

16:34.514 --> 16:38.473
You can stare at me all you want.
I am not going to go see Ned Miller.

16:45.783 --> 16:47.899
Oh, all right!

16:49.247 --> 16:52.683
I'll go to the station,
talk to the monster,

16:53.003 --> 16:55.756
attempt to get Bulldog his job back

16:56.050 --> 16:59.679
and probably end up spitting
out my teeth like Chiclets.

17:00.933 --> 17:02.685
Anything else I can do?

17:02.936 --> 17:06.133
(Barks)
Oh, we're low on dog food.

17:13.954 --> 17:15.069
(Knock on door)

17:15.290 --> 17:17.041
What? What?

17:18.294 --> 17:21.923
I don't mean to disturb you,
but Arlene wasn't...

17:22.260 --> 17:27.175
I let her go. What she's been doing
lately has been ticking me off.

17:27.560 --> 17:29.596
- If this is a bad time...
- It's a perfect time.

17:29.856 --> 17:32.609
Hold this.
Come on! Now!

17:34.030 --> 17:37.022
- Come on.
- OK, how's this?

17:37.326 --> 17:40.398
I'd love to tell you,
but your big head's in the way.

17:46.216 --> 17:50.971
- Oh, put it down.
- What happened here?!

17:51.349 --> 17:54.500
That psycho Bulldog and l
got into it this afternoon.

17:54.813 --> 17:56.849
He threw my Golden Mike at me.

17:57.109 --> 17:59.543
He did that with your little trophy?

17:59.821 --> 18:02.335
He just chipped the paint.
I did that with his head.

18:06.541 --> 18:08.771
That's sort of why I'm here.

18:09.045 --> 18:11.354
- Drink?
- No, thank you.

18:11.633 --> 18:15.546
I know that Bulldog was here and said
some regrettable things to you.

18:15.890 --> 18:19.519
I'll say. You want to hear them?
I tape everything in this office.

18:26.950 --> 18:32.388
Well, anyway, a lot of what he said
was... my fault, you see.

18:32.793 --> 18:38.470
I heard a rumour that management
was thinking about lightening the load.

18:38.886 --> 18:43.562
I heard that it was Bulldog
that was going to get sacked

18:43.936 --> 18:49.613
and I was repeating it to someone,
he heard me. That's why he told you.

18:50.029 --> 18:54.227
That I'm a drunk, incompetent,
that my wife is a big fat slut!

18:54.579 --> 18:57.696
That is indefensible!
Your wife is not overweight!

19:03.802 --> 19:06.953
Anyway, my point is,

19:09.270 --> 19:11.943
I'd like you to consider
giving Bulldog his job back

19:12.232 --> 19:16.020
and whatever the consequences
to me, I'm willing to accept it.

19:16.364 --> 19:20.403
Bulldog meant big numbers to us.
We need him back.

19:20.747 --> 19:26.424
You get him to apologise to me...
Oh, hell, why don't I just say it?

19:26.840 --> 19:29.752
If he'll kiss my ass,
maybe we can work something out.

19:31.473 --> 19:33.703
I'm sure that'll make him so happy.

19:34.937 --> 19:38.213
Well, I'll just get out of your hair.

19:38.527 --> 19:44.124
Actually, that rumour about
someone being let go: it's true.

19:44.536 --> 19:46.492
What?

19:46.748 --> 19:48.784
Now that
you've got Bulldog his job back,

19:49.043 --> 19:52.479
we need further cutbacks
in those high-priced salaries.

19:52.800 --> 19:56.679
- Oh, God, not Father Mike!
- No, it's not him.

19:57.015 --> 20:00.974
Chopper Dave?
Ray the "Greengrocer"?

20:03.943 --> 20:06.855
Bonnie "The Auto Lady" Weems?

20:11.372 --> 20:14.011
Look, Crane,
you're new to the radio game.

20:14.294 --> 20:16.854
I've been around a long time.

20:17.132 --> 20:22.081
People get fired but
they always get back on their feet.

20:23.350 --> 20:27.423
So... I bet I could get you that drink now.

20:28.609 --> 20:30.725
Yes, I bet you could.

20:30.988 --> 20:33.627
(Phone)
Help yourself.

20:34.869 --> 20:37.906
Ned Miller! Yo, Jack!

20:38.208 --> 20:40.722
No, what's wrong?
Come on, tell me now.

20:41.797 --> 20:43.753
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

20:44.009 --> 20:45.965
Yeah, I see.

20:46.222 --> 20:49.259
No, no, I... I got it.

20:52.565 --> 20:55.204
Thanks, Jack.

20:59.743 --> 21:01.699
Excuse me.

21:02.748 --> 21:04.704
Bad news?

21:04.961 --> 21:07.429
I've just been fired.

21:09.050 --> 21:13.089
They decided the best way to cut
the budget was to get rid of MY salary.

21:15.603 --> 21:18.675
Oh, Ned, I... I'm so sorry.

21:23.073 --> 21:25.792
Does this mean my job is still safe?

21:26.078 --> 21:27.955
I guess so.

21:29.125 --> 21:31.685
Well, you know, Ned,

21:34.926 --> 21:39.158
I haven't been
in the radio game that long

21:39.517 --> 21:43.874
but I've been around long enough
to know that people get fired.

21:44.233 --> 21:49.261
But they always land on their feet.
I've counselled a few people like you.

21:49.659 --> 21:54.289
In time, you will embrace this,
think of it as a new chapter.

21:54.667 --> 21:57.545
In theatrical circles, they always say,

21:57.839 --> 22:03.391
"Every exit is
but an entrance to somewhere else."

22:06.562 --> 22:10.111
God, I wish I had fired you
when I had the chance.

22:13.573 --> 22:19.045
# Baby, I hear the blues a-calling
Tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:19.458 --> 22:20.732
# Oh, my!

22:20.961 --> 22:26.194
# Maybe I seem a bit confused
Well, maybe...but I got you pegged!

22:27.931 --> 22:33.483
# But I don't know what to do with those
Tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:33.898 --> 22:36.935
# They're calling again
Good night! #
