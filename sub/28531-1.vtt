present in court today?

Mm-hmm.

16:34.994 --> 16:35.828
Yes.

16:36.454 --> 16:38.331
Can you point where he's seated?

16:45.546 --> 16:48.841
Let the record state the identification
of the defendant.

16:54.347 --> 16:56.057
No more questions, Your Honor.

16:56.557 --> 16:57.725
Hi, Miss Daronch.

16:58.392 --> 17:00.603
Had the police shown you
a picture of my client

17:00.686 --> 17:04.065
prior to your identification of him 
at the October 2nd lineup?

17:05.107 --> 17:05.942
[Carol] Yes.

17:06.359 --> 17:08.236
You did in fact
pick his picture out of a pile

17:08.319 --> 17:09.987
but when asked specifically

17:10.196 --> 17:13.282
why you chose his picture, you stated

17:13.783 --> 17:17.954
"It looks something like him,
but I really couldn't say for sure."

17:18.538 --> 17:19.622
Is that correct?

17:21.374 --> 17:22.333
Mm-hmm.

17:22.833 --> 17:27.046
The only remotely corroborative evidence
you provided was a make of a vehicle.

17:27.129 --> 17:30.383
It's a Volkswagen, one of the most popular
cars in America.

17:30.591 --> 17:34.136
Yet his Volkswagen looks
nothing like your description.

17:34.220 --> 17:35.429

Hmm. I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.

to be the car.

17:56.993 --> 17:59.078
It is horrible what you went through.

17:59.161 --> 18:00.830
But the fact of the matter is

18:01.247 --> 18:02.582
you identified my client

18:02.665 --> 18:04.959

wanted you to, didn't you?

Oh, Ted.

55:01.590 --> 55:03.217
What have they done to you?

55:03.509 --> 55:05.302
Are you okay? Why are you limping?

55:05.594 --> 55:06.595
I'm fine, I'm fine.

55:06.678 --> 55:08.806
There's a problem with my leg.

55:10.307 --> 55:11.558
I run too fast.

55:11.892 --> 55:13.185
[laughs]

55:16.438 --> 55:17.856
Hey, no touching.

55:17.940 --> 55:19.650
Yup. I know. Thank you.

55:20.526 --> 55:21.527
Relax.

55:25.030 --> 55:27.491
I can't believe
what they've managed to do.

55:27.991 --> 55:29.743
They're using me as a ploy

55:29.827 --> 55:32.037
for the Sheriff to win points
in the next election.

55:32.120 --> 55:33.747
I'm being used for political gain.

55:33.831 --> 55:35.874
-My God. Of course.
-Think about it.

55:35.958 --> 55:38.669
He's been spinning his wheels
on this sorority case

55:38.752 --> 55:42.047

lands right in his little pond.

55:42.381 --> 55:44.091
Who do you think he's gonna pin it on?

55:44.675 --> 55:47.719
I literally just autographed
my own "wanted" poster.

55:48.178 --> 55:50.138
I'm more popular than Disney World.

55:50.681 --> 55:51.515
[Ted chuckles]

55:56.728 --> 55:57.688
It would...

55:58.021 --> 55:59.481
probably feel good to...

56:01.859 --> 56:03.694
have a familiar face around.

56:06.029 --> 56:07.739
What, you wanna move to Florida?

56:09.116 --> 56:10.158
Why not?

56:11.535 --> 56:13.245
There are worse places to be.

56:20.836 --> 56:22.296
It's great to see you.

56:24.715 --> 56:25.883
[guard] No touching!

56:38.020 --> 56:40.022
[knocking at door] 

56:51.283 --> 56:52.242
Hey.

56:55.746 --> 56:57.205
Brought you some chicken soup.

56:57.289 --> 56:58.248
Thank you.

56:59.207 --> 57:02.544
I mean, you haven't been at work all week,
so I figured you were sick.

57:06.548 --> 57:07.424
All right.

57:07.925 --> 57:09.301
All right. Feel better.

57:15.015 --> 57:16.266
Do you wanna come in?

57:18.518 --> 57:19.478
Yeah!

57:20.646 --> 57:22.648
Molly will be home from school soon.

57:26.234 --> 57:28.320
Sorry, it's... a mess.

57:28.445 --> 57:30.781
It's okay. Cleaner than my place.

57:30.864 --> 57:31.823
[both chuckle]

57:39.831 --> 57:40.666
Thank you. 

57:42.626 --> 57:43.710
Ted!

57:44.294 --> 57:46.088
I'm Dan Dowd. I'll be your lead counsel.

57:46.171 --> 57:49.508
I've got a great team of public defenders
waiting in a private room.

57:50.425 --> 57:52.761
We're gonna get you
the best defense taxes can buy.

57:53.261 --> 57:56.515
Should we go meet them
so we can discuss this in private?

57:57.140 --> 58:00.227
Anything you have to say,
you can say in front of Carole Ann.

58:01.186 --> 58:02.813
Yeah. Go ahead, have a seat.

58:06.024 --> 58:07.818
Hi, Carole Ann. Dan Dowd.

58:09.736 --> 58:10.821
Is it true?

58:11.029 --> 58:13.615
They're putting
news cameras in the courtroom?

58:13.991 --> 58:16.868
You'll be the first
nationally televised trial in history.

58:17.160 --> 58:18.996
If you make it to trial, that is.

58:19.746 --> 58:21.623
The State is offering a deal, Ted.

58:21.707 --> 58:23.917
If you plead guilty
to the murder charges,

58:24.626 --> 58:26.503
they've agreed to recommend life sentences

58:26.586 --> 58:28.088
instead of the death penalty.

58:29.423 --> 58:30.841
That's a joke, right?

58:31.925 --> 58:34.970
We should really go and discuss this
with the rest of the team, Ted.

58:35.387 --> 58:37.097
If you think there's a chance in hell

58:37.180 --> 58:38.932
I'll plead guilty to these charges,

58:39.016 --> 58:40.726
you're out of your fucking mind!

58:44.354 --> 58:46.148
Let's discuss this another time, okay?

58:46.231 --> 58:47.274
Okay.

58:49.026 --> 58:50.652
Great to meet you, Carole Ann.

58:53.989 --> 58:55.157
[door buzzes] 

58:57.075 --> 58:59.369
My own lawyers are against me.

58:59.453 --> 59:00.912
This is a nightmare.

59:02.122 --> 59:03.498
So sorry, Ted.

59:06.334 --> 59:07.836
Tell me what I can do to help.

59:09.337 --> 59:13.175
You know, maybe I could 
set the facts straight on the outside

59:13.258 --> 59:15.802
and make sure 
your side of the story is heard.

59:16.970 --> 59:18.430
That would help a lot.

59:19.347 --> 59:20.724
I'm under a gag order.

59:21.516 --> 59:22.976
I can't say anything.

59:24.728 --> 59:26.313
You'd be willing to do that for me?

59:27.606 --> 59:28.607
Of course.

59:29.941 --> 59:31.693
Ted, I'm staying in Florida.

59:33.737 --> 59:36.907
I would never ask you
to do anything like this. I--

59:38.450 --> 59:39.659
[guard] No touching.

59:41.244 --> 59:43.705
You're not asking. I'm insisting.

59:44.498 --> 59:45.749
Ted, you need me.

59:47.417 --> 59:49.795
It wasn't an accident I saw you in Utah.

59:49.961 --> 59:51.588
I don't have friends in Utah.

59:52.422 --> 59:54.049
I was there for you.

59:56.218 --> 59:57.886
When I saw you were engaged,

59:58.720 --> 59:59.679
I got cold feet.

1:00:01.515 --> 1:00:03.141
This trial could get ugly.

1:00:04.935 --> 1:00:08.355
I don't know, but, I mean,
you can hear some really awful things.

1:00:08.647 --> 1:00:11.441
Can't be any worse than what
they're already saying on TV.

1:00:12.317 --> 1:00:13.693
What do they know?

1:00:14.861 --> 1:00:16.488
Not the truth.

1:00:16.613 --> 1:00:18.532
-[reporters clamoring] 
-[man] <i>Mr. Simpson!</i>

1:00:18.615 --> 1:00:21.034
-Do you have any comments on the trial?
-Let me say this...

1:00:21.243 --> 1:00:23.161
This man is a threat to society,

1:00:23.662 --> 1:00:25.413
he's made a mockery of our justice system.

1:00:25.497 --> 1:00:27.666
That may have worked
on the other side of the Rockies,

1:00:27.749 --> 1:00:30.293
but as lead prosecutor
for the great state of Florida

1:00:30.544 --> 1:00:33.839
I have every intention of showing him how
we do things in the Sunshine State.

1:00:34.089 --> 1:00:36.424

Thank you, Your Honor.

[Cowart] <i>You may proceed, Mr. Simpson.</i>

1:02:07.724 --> 1:02:08.808
Ladies and gentlemen,

1:02:09.309 --> 1:02:10.393
this case...

1:02:10.477 --> 1:02:13.146
is so much more than a double murder.

1:02:13.230 --> 1:02:15.857
[whispering]
Don't let his opening statement faze you.

1:02:15.941 --> 1:02:17.734
-Show no emotion at all.
-[Simpson] This case...

1:02:18.235 --> 1:02:20.362
is about catching a monster.

1:02:22.447 --> 1:02:26.284
In the early morning hours
of January 15th, 1978,

1:02:26.576 --> 1:02:30.830
a young woman arrived home 
to the Chi Omega sorority house.

1:02:30.914 --> 1:02:33.208
She heard a thump upstairs.

1:02:35.001 --> 1:02:37.629
A man ran down carrying an oak log

1:02:37.921 --> 1:02:39.047
and fled.

1:02:39.589 --> 1:02:41.758
The young woman went upstairs
to investigate

1:02:41.841 --> 1:02:46.137
where her sorority sister stumbled out 
of her bedroom spitting up blood

1:02:46.846 --> 1:02:48.473
because her face had been smashed.

1:02:50.600 --> 1:02:51.685
Her roommate's too.

1:02:51.768 --> 1:02:54.479
She was sitting on her bed in a daze.

1:02:56.982 --> 1:02:58.233
They were the lucky ones.

1:03:00.277 --> 1:03:01.861
In the room next over,

1:03:01.945 --> 1:03:05.365
another young woman
was lying face down in her own blood.

1:03:05.699 --> 1:03:08.285
<i>Her neck had been twisted</i>
<i>at an inhuman angle.</i>

1:03:09.661 --> 1:03:10.954
<i>The jaw was broken.</i>

1:03:12.914 --> 1:03:14.207
<i>She was missing a nipple.</i>

1:03:15.875 --> 1:03:17.377
Her body had bite marks on it.

1:03:18.253 --> 1:03:19.546
She'd been raped...

1:03:19.963 --> 1:03:21.256
and strangled.

1:03:21.673 --> 1:03:24.384
Strangled with a pantyhose garrote,

1:03:24.467 --> 1:03:28.221
so tight that her neck
was constricted to half its size.

1:03:28.305 --> 1:03:30.223
[crowd mumbling]

1:03:31.308 --> 1:03:32.517
This next girl...

1:03:34.936 --> 1:03:37.772
we're still not sure if she died
from strangulation

1:03:38.064 --> 1:03:41.818
or the blow to her head that left 
a baseball-sized hole in her skull.

1:03:45.238 --> 1:03:48.408
We do know that her underwear was torn
off with such force,

1:03:48.491 --> 1:03:50.493
it left burn marks on her thigh.

1:03:53.580 --> 1:03:54.456
<i>Thank you.</i>

1:03:55.540 --> 1:03:57.751
[reporter] <i>Each day, </i>

[reporter]<i> The young women themselves</i>

[reporter] <i>One woman, Carole Boone, </i>
<i>believes Bundy is completely innocent.</i>

1:04:38.500 --> 1:04:40.418

[Carole] <i>What if I started by saying</i>

1:04:44.172 --> 1:04:46.841
You can't explicitly
call the media the villain.

1:04:46.925 --> 1:04:48.802
We have to be more creative than that. 

1:04:48.885 --> 1:04:51.596
"It is obvious that the media
has already convicted him

1:04:51.721 --> 1:04:53.139

1:04:53.223 --> 1:04:55.350
Well, it's obvious the media has already
convicted Ted

1:04:56.810 --> 1:04:57.936
"To broadcast that--"

1:04:58.061 --> 1:05:00.146
And to broadcast it on a national stage...

1:05:00.230 --> 1:05:02.399
it's the first step in undercutting
the judicial system

1:05:02.857 --> 1:05:06.444
because it makes it about getting ratings,
not about getting the truth.

When we questioned him about the crimes,

1:05:15.328 --> 1:05:17.247
he declined to have an attorney present.

1:05:17.330 --> 1:05:20.208
He asked not to have counsel?

-That's right.
-[whispering] Object. He's lying.

1:05:25.130 --> 1:05:26.256
You need to do your job!

1:05:26.381 --> 1:05:29.008
Then he asked we turn off the recorder.

1:05:29.426 --> 1:05:30.844
And no notes be taken.

1:05:30.927 --> 1:05:33.054
So this was off the record?

1:05:33.221 --> 1:05:34.180
He thought so.

-What part was that, Detective?
-His confession.

Do something, or I'm gonna--

1:05:47.485 --> 1:05:49.279
What did he say in his confession?

1:05:49.362 --> 1:05:50.864
He said he was a vampire.

1:05:51.781 --> 1:05:52.824

-[Ted] Your Honor...

1:06:10.842 --> 1:06:14.179
I also move to have
the detective's entire testimony

1:06:14.262 --> 1:06:15.305
stricken from the record,

1:06:15.388 --> 1:06:17.932
on the basis that the word "surreptitious"

1:06:18.016 --> 1:06:21.644
should automatically disqualify
anything masquerading as evidence,

1:06:22.145 --> 1:06:26.691
being that it's synonymous with "secret,"
"stealthy," "clandestine,"

1:06:26.983 --> 1:06:29.736
"sneaky," "sly," "furtive," "concealed,"
and "hidden."

1:06:29.819 --> 1:06:31.696
Your Honor, is he allowed to keep talking?

1:06:31.779 --> 1:06:33.198
No true evidence

1:06:33.740 --> 1:06:37.243
should, could, or would 
ever be described in such terms.

1:06:37.410 --> 1:06:40.872
-Your Honor, the jury--
-Objection is sustained.

combined with pre-trial publicity,

1:09:49.102 --> 1:09:51.396
it's highly likely
they can secure convictions.

1:09:51.479 --> 1:09:53.272
And because of the nature of the offenses,

1:09:53.356 --> 1:09:54.482
several death sentences.

1:11:48.638 --> 1:11:49.931

1:11:52.475 --> 1:11:53.392

in coercing his own client
into admitting guilt.

1:11:59.148 --> 1:12:01.818
It makes me wonder if he has the stamina

1:12:01.984 --> 1:12:03.820
or basic mental acuity

1:12:03.903 --> 1:12:06.322
to roll up his sleeves
and do the hard work.

1:12:07.114 --> 1:12:10.952
I will not accept
my so-called attorney's advice

1:15:31.736 --> 1:15:33.362
Yes, this is Ted.

1:15:33.863 --> 1:15:35.406
<i>And I would like to speak to Liz.</i>

1:15:36.157 --> 1:15:37.742
You can't call her anymore.

1:15:38.367 --> 1:15:39.410
You're killing her.

1:15:40.494 --> 1:15:42.955
Then, will you please
give her a message for me?

1:15:43.539 --> 1:15:45.124
Can you do that, please?

1:15:46.208 --> 1:15:47.626
<i>Can you tell her, um..</i>

1:15:50.546 --> 1:15:52.173
Can you tell her that I love her?

1:15:53.257 --> 1:15:54.091
[phone slams] 

1:15:57.720 --> 1:16:01.015
[laughter echoing] 

1:16:01.098 --> 1:16:02.600
[laughing]

1:16:48.354 --> 1:16:49.480
[woman moaning]

1:16:49.563 --> 1:16:51.565
[metal rattling]

1:16:54.068 --> 1:16:56.070
[Carole moaning] 

1:16:58.322 --> 1:16:59.281
[Ted] Oh, fuck. 

1:17:00.074 --> 1:17:01.575
[both groaning] 

1:17:09.625 --> 1:17:10.709
Oh, wow!

1:17:15.631 --> 1:17:16.549
Ted?

1:17:19.802 --> 1:17:20.761
Ted?

1:17:23.013 --> 1:17:23.973
Look at me!

1:17:24.974 --> 1:17:25.850
Huh?

1:17:26.308 --> 1:17:27.393
Do you...

1:17:28.727 --> 1:17:29.854
Do you still love her?

1:17:31.522 --> 1:17:33.149
What are you talking about? Who?

1:17:33.816 --> 1:17:34.733
Oh, my God.

1:17:35.151 --> 1:17:36.944
-No...
-Oh, my God. I'm so stupid.

1:17:37.027 --> 1:17:37.987
Carole Ann, just--

1:17:38.070 --> 1:17:41.157
I mean, I just uprooted 
my entire life for you!

1:17:41.323 --> 1:17:42.533
She's not here!

1:17:43.492 --> 1:17:45.494
-But you love her!
-I don't! I don't!

1:17:45.578 --> 1:17:46.829
She abandoned me!

1:17:46.912 --> 1:17:48.164
She left me.

1:17:48.664 --> 1:17:49.790
She's gone.

1:17:50.875 --> 1:17:52.376
What about me?

1:17:53.669 --> 1:17:54.670
I love you.

1:17:54.837 --> 1:17:55.754
You're here.

1:17:56.630 --> 1:17:58.090
You're right here.

1:17:58.174 --> 1:18:00.092
I almost married that girl.

1:18:04.013 --> 1:18:05.639
And... and you know what?

1:18:06.056 --> 1:18:08.100
You're the one I should've married.

1:18:10.186 --> 1:18:11.478
Do you mean that?

1:18:12.563 --> 1:18:13.522
Yeah.

1:18:14.356 --> 1:18:15.566
Just imagine it.

1:18:18.485 --> 1:18:19.570
I'll get out of here.

1:18:21.238 --> 1:18:22.364
We can get a house...

1:18:23.574 --> 1:18:24.617
on the Sound.

1:18:26.285 --> 1:18:27.411
With a Mercedes...

1:18:29.205 --> 1:18:30.372
and a dog.

1:18:32.124 --> 1:18:33.584
I can hear him barking.

1:18:35.252 --> 1:18:36.128
Can you?

1:18:38.422 --> 1:18:39.840
I'm allergic to dogs.

1:18:42.301 --> 1:18:43.761
But that sounds nice.

1:18:44.803 --> 1:18:45.971
Oh, Ted.

1:18:48.432 --> 1:18:50.309
I just wish we didn't have to wait.

1:18:52.186 --> 1:18:53.771
Who says we have to wait?

1:18:54.688 --> 1:18:55.731
We don't.

1:19:00.486 --> 1:19:01.737
Miss Boone.

1:19:02.529 --> 1:19:07.534
Did you visit me while I was being held
in Florida in custody in February, 1978?

1:19:08.452 --> 1:19:10.204
Yes. Yes, I did.

1:19:10.287 --> 1:19:11.872
And to the best of your memory,

1:19:11.956 --> 1:19:14.875
did I have any sort of chip
in my front tooth at that time?

1:19:14.959 --> 1:19:17.294
No. No, you most definitely did not.

1:19:17.378 --> 1:19:18.295
[Ted] Your Honor...

1:19:19.255 --> 1:19:21.298
I think you see what I'm getting at here.

1:19:22.174 --> 1:19:25.886
I would like to subpoena all newspapers
to turn over their negatives of me.

1:19:26.637 --> 1:19:31.016
If the chip did not occur
until March, 1978,

1:19:31.100 --> 1:19:33.519
two months after the Chi Omega crimes

1:19:33.602 --> 1:19:35.771
and the state's odontologists
say otherwise,

1:19:35.938 --> 1:19:39.358
the state's odontologists have obviously
taken my teeth

1:19:39.441 --> 1:19:42.194
and twisted them 
every which way but loose

1:19:42.278 --> 1:19:43.279
to fit.

1:19:44.238 --> 1:19:48.284
Son, you can jump up and down 
and hang from the chandelier,

1:19:48.367 --> 1:19:52.538
but the court will not dash out 
for new evidence at your command.

1:19:54.832 --> 1:19:57.376
Is there no work ethic
left here in Florida?

1:19:57.459 --> 1:19:58.961
You impress me not, sir.

1:19:59.044 --> 1:20:00.671
The feeling is mutual, Your Honor.

1:20:00.754 --> 1:20:02.589
I'm sure it is. Bless your heart.

1:20:02.673 --> 1:20:04.758
And unless there is anything else,

1:20:04.842 --> 1:20:06.468
Miss Boone may be excused.

1:20:06.593 --> 1:20:09.179
No, there is one-- Just one more thing.

1:20:09.763 --> 1:20:10.723
Your Honor...

1:20:17.187 --> 1:20:18.355
Will you marry me?

1:20:18.897 --> 1:20:20.816
[crowd murmuring]

1:20:21.442 --> 1:20:22.276
Your Honor...

1:20:22.526 --> 1:20:24.320
Yes. [giggles] 

1:20:27.573 --> 1:20:29.033
Then I do hereby...

1:20:29.908 --> 1:20:30.826
marry you.

1:20:30.909 --> 1:20:32.494
Are you shitting me? Objection!

1:20:32.578 --> 1:20:33.495
[Ted] Your Honor...

1:20:33.579 --> 1:20:35.748
a public declaration properly phrased,

1:20:35.831 --> 1:20:37.958
in an open courtroom,
in the presence of court officers

1:20:38.042 --> 1:20:40.377
constitutes a lawful marriage
here in Florida.

1:20:41.503 --> 1:20:42.755
Indeed it does.

1:20:48.385 --> 1:20:49.511
[gavel bangs] 

1:20:49.595 --> 1:20:53.140
[reporter] <i>Prosecutors dismissed</i>
<i>Bundy's marriage proposal as a charade--</i>

1:20:55.851 --> 1:20:57.603
Was it him who called the other day?

1:21:01.148 --> 1:21:03.609
I know you unplug the phones
when I fall asleep.

1:21:04.943 --> 1:21:06.111
What did he say?

1:21:06.904 --> 1:21:08.822
-It doesn't matter.
-What did he say?

1:21:10.407 --> 1:21:11.492
He froze.

1:21:11.617 --> 1:21:14.703
He froze because he knew
that I knew what he was.

1:21:14.787 --> 1:21:17.289
They're going to send him
to the chair, Liz.

1:21:17.373 --> 1:21:19.333
And that seems
like an easier out than this torture

1:21:19.416 --> 1:21:22.086
you're putting yourself through
because you won't let him go.

1:21:22.169 --> 1:21:24.338
He's killing you
because you're letting him.

1:21:25.422 --> 1:21:28.842
You're just jealous because Ted and I
have a bond you and I never could.

1:21:30.427 --> 1:21:32.012
You're just trying to hurt me.

1:21:32.930 --> 1:21:33.972
Get out.

1:21:36.767 --> 1:21:37.893
Get out!

1:21:38.060 --> 1:21:39.728
-You need to let him go.
-Get out!

1:21:39.812 --> 1:21:43.899
-You need-- Let him go!
-Get out! Get out! Get out!

1:21:44.024 --> 1:21:45.859
-[sobbing]
-Shh.

1:21:45.943 --> 1:21:46.902
It's okay.

1:21:47.277 --> 1:21:49.154
I wish I could take it all back.

1:21:49.238 --> 1:21:50.406
It's okay.

1:21:50.489 --> 1:21:51.698
[sobbing]

1:21:54.034 --> 1:21:55.077
Take what back?

1:21:55.369 --> 1:21:59.206
Why do you act like you're responsible
for the things that happened to him?

1:22:07.172 --> 1:22:09.383
I'm the one
who gave his name to the police.

1:22:10.801 --> 1:22:13.720
[reporter] <i>He was described </i>
<i>as 5'7 to 5'8...</i>

1:22:13.804 --> 1:22:17.266
<i>neck-length hair,</i>
<i>brown to light brown, dark tan,</i>

1:22:17.391 --> 1:22:20.144
<i>160 pounds, cast on the left arm.</i>

1:22:20.227 --> 1:22:21.979
[man on phone] 
<i>King County Sheriff's Department.</i>

1:22:22.062 --> 1:22:24.523
Back when those girls disappeared
from Lake Sammamish

1:22:24.982 --> 1:22:27.317
I saw the sketch.

1:22:27.401 --> 1:22:30.446
It's a minor resemblance,
but it's very, very minor and--

1:22:30.529 --> 1:22:32.072
[man] <i>What kind of car does he drive?</i>

1:22:32.156 --> 1:22:34.032
It's a 1968 Volkswagen Bug.

1:22:34.241 --> 1:22:35.742
But it's kind of a light beige--

1:22:35.826 --> 1:22:37.119
<i>Let me stop you right there.</i>

1:22:37.202 --> 1:22:39.455
<i>It's the right car,</i>
<i>but it's the wrong color.</i>

1:22:40.164 --> 1:22:41.248
<i>He's not the guy.</i>

1:22:41.415 --> 1:22:44.001
<i>I can put his name down</i>
<i> if it'll help you sleep at night.</i>

1:22:44.293 --> 1:22:46.295
<i>-What is his name?</i>
-Um...

1:22:48.422 --> 1:22:49.339
Ted.

1:22:50.841 --> 1:22:52.009
Ted Bundy.

1:22:52.092 --> 1:22:53.677
I could be the reason that he's there.

1:22:53.760 --> 1:22:55.262
Because everyone's assuming

1:22:55.345 --> 1:22:57.598
that all these other murders
were done by Ted

1:22:57.723 --> 1:23:00.142
and all I did
was call his name in to Seattle,

1:23:00.225 --> 1:23:03.312
because of a sketch
that looked kind of like him.

1:23:03.729 --> 1:23:05.063
You were the one that told them.

1:23:06.023 --> 1:23:07.649
You shouldn't be ashamed of that.

1:23:08.066 --> 1:23:09.443
If you told them that--

1:23:09.776 --> 1:23:11.487
He... he deserves it, Liz.

1:23:11.653 --> 1:23:13.197
Liz, you did the right thing.

1:23:16.533 --> 1:23:18.368
You just gotta let him go.

1:23:20.370 --> 1:23:23.290
Mr. Simpson, your closing argument.

1:23:31.256 --> 1:23:32.925
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

1:23:34.051 --> 1:23:37.804
you have been witness
to the unspeakable horrors

1:23:38.472 --> 1:23:40.390
of the defendant's heinous crimes.

1:23:41.350 --> 1:23:42.518
You've seen...

1:23:42.851 --> 1:23:43.894
ghastly injuries,

1:23:44.353 --> 1:23:46.897
smashed in faces, broken jaws...

1:23:51.109 --> 1:23:53.403
The bite-mark carnage of a predator.

1:23:54.488 --> 1:23:55.697
[Ted] Ladies and gentlemen...

1:23:56.323 --> 1:23:57.824
there are two ways

1:23:58.534 --> 1:24:00.452
for police to investigate crimes.

1:24:01.495 --> 1:24:03.080
They can go to a crime scene...

1:24:04.414 --> 1:24:05.707
<i>search for clues</i>

1:24:06.124 --> 1:24:09.670
<i>and follow those clues</i>
<i>to a logical conclusion...</i>

1:24:09.753 --> 1:24:12.339
We have provided forensic expert testimony

1:24:12.422 --> 1:24:14.967
<i>to corroborate every last bit of evidence.</i>

1:24:15.092 --> 1:24:17.636
...or they can begin with a suspect,

1:24:18.887 --> 1:24:21.014
decide on that suspect,

1:24:21.098 --> 1:24:24.101
and then somehow
make all of the evidence fit

1:24:24.184 --> 1:24:26.311
only that suspect.

1:24:26.395 --> 1:24:28.897
You've seen
the bottle of hair mist he used

1:24:28.981 --> 1:24:30.899
to sexually penetrate 
one of the victims,

1:24:30.983 --> 1:24:34.486
in a manner so savage
it ruptured her internal organs.

1:24:34.820 --> 1:24:38.907
It is clearly a charade
to cast an innocent man

1:24:38.991 --> 1:24:42.327
as some sort of monster in a horror film. 

1:24:42.411 --> 1:24:44.580
We have placed the defendant
at the scene of the crime...

1:24:44.663 --> 1:24:46.290
Their own witness testified

1:24:46.373 --> 1:24:49.418
that the man wore a mask,
obscuring half of his face.

1:24:49.501 --> 1:24:53.297
You've seen the oak log he used
to bludgeon these poor victims.

1:24:53.589 --> 1:24:54.840
The lighting was low.

1:24:54.923 --> 1:24:58.427
The State of Florida has proved beyond
all reasonable doubt

1:24:58.844 --> 1:25:01.263
that the defendant
Theodore Robert Bundy

1:25:01.346 --> 1:25:04.683
is guilty of two murders
in the first-degree

1:25:04.766 --> 1:25:06.643
and three attempted murders.

1:25:06.727 --> 1:25:08.854
Ladies and gentlemen, I am...

1:25:10.022 --> 1:25:11.732
that innocent suspect.

1:25:14.901 --> 1:25:18.113
Ted, Ted, is this really just a case
of wrong place, wrong time?

1:25:18.405 --> 1:25:20.532
You know, police,
they just wanna solve crimes.

1:25:20.616 --> 1:25:22.826
And sometimes they don't think things
all the way through.

1:25:22.909 --> 1:25:25.621
They are willing to take 
the convenient alternative.

1:25:25.704 --> 1:25:28.206
And in this case,
the convenient alternative was me.

1:25:28.290 --> 1:25:29.875
[deputy] Ted, we have a verdict.

1:25:30.500 --> 1:25:31.710
They've come to verdict.

1:25:31.877 --> 1:25:34.004
Oh, my gosh. Seven hours.

1:25:34.880 --> 1:25:35.881
Well...

1:25:36.840 --> 1:25:37.799
bless their hearts.

1:25:38.925 --> 1:25:40.218
-[Ted chuckling]
-Ted.

1:25:41.720 --> 1:25:43.805
You know that future you saw for us?

1:25:44.348 --> 1:25:46.266
The one with the house
and the dog and the car?

1:25:47.309 --> 1:25:48.977
Well, yeah. Yeah.

1:25:49.603 --> 1:25:50.479
Well...

1:25:51.271 --> 1:25:53.607
now there's going to be another part
to that future.

1:25:56.985 --> 1:25:57.861
Ted...

1:25:58.028 --> 1:25:59.154
it's time to go.

1:26:00.614 --> 1:26:01.490
Ted.

1:26:01.907 --> 1:26:03.700
Yeah... yeah, I--

1:26:03.784 --> 1:26:05.661
I'll-- One... just one moment. Um...

1:26:13.960 --> 1:26:15.295
Let's go finish this thing.

1:26:23.011 --> 1:26:27.140
I am in receipt
of the jury's verdict, Bailiff.

1:26:27.933 --> 1:26:32.187
Would you deliver this to the clerk
for pronouncement?

1:26:34.648 --> 1:26:36.525
Will the defendant rise?

1:26:42.030 --> 1:26:44.658
<i>We, the jury,</i>
<i>in Miami-Dade County, Florida,</i>

1:26:44.741 --> 1:26:47.828
find the defendant Theodore Robert Bundy,

1:26:48.120 --> 1:26:51.456
on the count of murder
in the first degree of Lisa Levy,

1:26:52.040 --> 1:26:53.291
<i>guilty as charged.</i>

1:26:53.458 --> 1:26:56.503
On the count of murder in the first degree
of Margaret Bowman,

1:26:57.796 --> 1:27:01.550
On the count of attempted murder 
in the first degree of Karen Chandler...

1:27:02.175 --> 1:27:03.176
guilty as charged.

1:27:03.802 --> 1:27:06.179

1:27:07.848 --> 1:27:09.099

<i>So say we all. </i>

1:27:20.819 --> 1:27:23.196
[Louise]<i> I consider the death penalty</i>

1:27:26.074 --> 1:27:27.576
barbaric things

1:27:28.702 --> 1:27:31.747
one human can impose on another.

1:27:34.082 --> 1:27:36.626
My Christian upbringing tells me that

1:27:36.710 --> 1:27:38.462
to take another's life

1:27:39.421 --> 1:27:42.215
under any circumstance is wrong.

1:27:44.092 --> 1:27:47.637
And I don't believe that the State of
Florida is above the laws of God.

1:27:48.722 --> 1:27:49.848
Thank you, ma'am.

1:27:51.558 --> 1:27:52.476
<i>Bless you.</i>

1:27:54.936 --> 1:27:57.147
<i>While I certainly agree it is...</i>

1:27:58.523 --> 1:28:00.442
<i>always a tragedy</i>

1:28:00.817 --> 1:28:04.863
<i>when any life is taken</i>
<i>against one's will...</i>

1:28:09.117 --> 1:28:11.703
it is this court's reasoned judgement

1:28:11.787 --> 1:28:16.291
you be adjudicated guilty
of murder in the first degree...

1:28:17.250 --> 1:28:20.003
that the killings were indeed

1:28:20.295 --> 1:28:24.090
atrocious and cruel in that they were 

1:28:24.257 --> 1:28:26.092
extremely wicked,

1:28:27.010 --> 1:28:28.678
shockingly evil,

1:28:29.888 --> 1:28:30.847
vile...

1:28:31.306 --> 1:28:34.351
and with utter indifference to human life

1:28:34.434 --> 1:28:38.772
and that you shall be put to death
by current of electricity

1:28:38.897 --> 1:28:40.857
that shall pass through your body

1:28:40.941 --> 1:28:42.275
until you are dead.

1:28:43.318 --> 1:28:46.029
I understand you have
a statement you'd like to make,

1:28:46.112 --> 1:28:47.697
and you may do so now.

1:28:49.157 --> 1:28:51.117
I won't ask for mercy.

1:28:53.662 --> 1:28:54.663
In fact...

1:28:56.581 --> 1:28:58.208
I find it absurd

1:28:58.500 --> 1:29:01.503
to ask for mercy
for something that I did not do.

1:29:05.841 --> 1:29:08.635
I'm not the one responsible for these...

1:29:09.761 --> 1:29:10.929
horrific acts.

1:29:14.933 --> 1:29:17.978
Although the verdict found in part...

1:29:19.563 --> 1:29:22.274
that these crimes had been committed...

1:29:24.860 --> 1:29:25.735
it erred...

1:29:26.945 --> 1:29:29.114
in finding who committed them.

1:29:32.617 --> 1:29:34.202
As a consequence...

1:29:35.328 --> 1:29:38.039
I do not accept the sentence

1:29:40.834 --> 1:29:42.794
because it is not a sentence of me.

1:29:45.755 --> 1:29:48.174
It is a sentence of someone else

1:29:48.675 --> 1:29:50.927
who is not standing here today.

1:29:52.804 --> 1:29:57.767
The court is going to sentence the person
found guilty of the offense.

1:29:58.184 --> 1:30:00.312
Your name, sir, was on that verdict.

1:30:01.146 --> 1:30:03.148
Take care of yourself, young man.

1:30:03.648 --> 1:30:05.775
I say that to you, sincerely.

1:30:06.526 --> 1:30:07.777
Take care of yourself.

1:30:09.029 --> 1:30:10.697
You're a bright young man.

1:30:11.823 --> 1:30:13.533
You'd have made a good lawyer.

1:30:13.617 --> 1:30:16.244
I would've loved to have you practice
in front of me.

1:30:16.703 --> 1:30:17.746
But...

1:30:18.038 --> 1:30:20.540
you went to a different way, partner.

1:30:21.750 --> 1:30:24.711
It is been a tragedy for this court

1:30:25.337 --> 1:30:31.092
to see the total waste of humanity
that we have experienced here.

1:30:33.053 --> 1:30:35.889
I don't have any animosity toward you.

1:30:36.598 --> 1:30:38.016
I want you to know that.

1:31:22.686 --> 1:31:24.980

an outstanding job so far.

1:31:25.105 --> 1:31:26.815
This is a really
wonderful place for women.

1:31:26.940 --> 1:31:29.150
Liz, I thought you'd like to see this.

1:31:29.275 --> 1:31:30.318
Thanks, Janet.

1:31:35.699 --> 1:31:37.993

would you give me a moment, please?

We started with lies, Ted.

1:33:29.979 --> 1:33:32.524
My love for you was never a lie.

1:33:33.817 --> 1:33:36.528
I fell in love with you

1:33:43.493 --> 1:33:45.495
I would never hurt a woman.

Have I ever laid a hand on you?
Have I ever raised my voice?

I'm the one who gave your name 
to the police.

1:33:53.837 --> 1:33:54.921

1:33:58.049 --> 1:33:59.884
It was 1974,

1:34:00.093 --> 1:34:03.721
when they put that sketch in the paper
of the man at Lake Sammamish,

1:34:03.805 --> 1:34:08.601
who used a fake cast to lure two young
women into his Volkswagen Bug.

1:34:08.977 --> 1:34:11.020

I used to think that I ruined your life

1:34:17.569 --> 1:34:19.988
because my call to King County 
made you the suspect

in all these other cases.

1:34:22.031 --> 1:34:24.284
For years I've carried this guilt

1:34:24.367 --> 1:34:26.744
that I'm to blame for everything.

1:34:27.829 --> 1:34:29.747
Why would you blame yourself?

1:34:30.165 --> 1:34:32.667
Because I could have helped
save some of these girls

1:34:32.876 --> 1:34:34.669

1:34:35.628 --> 1:34:37.714
I can't live like this anymore, Ted.

1:34:38.047 --> 1:34:39.507
It's not my guilt.

1:34:40.216 --> 1:34:41.301
It's yours.

1:34:43.636 --> 1:34:46.764
Did you do these things, Ted?

1:34:49.100 --> 1:34:50.476
Of course not.

1:34:50.602 --> 1:34:52.979
There are detectives

So, yes, I'm feeding them information,
little bits of bullshit,

1:35:15.627 --> 1:35:17.170
but none of it is true.

1:35:17.545 --> 1:35:19.130
This is all gonna end.

1:36:29.742 --> 1:36:31.828

1:43:21.946 --> 1:43:23.989
[reporter 2] 
<i>Bundy had refused to show up on time,</i>

1:43:24.073 --> 1:43:26.492
<i>protesting conditions</i>
<i>at the Dade County Jail.</i>

1:43:27.451 --> 1:43:29.245
Since I have been in Dade County,

1:43:29.328 --> 1:43:30.246
I've been--

1:43:30.329 --> 1:43:32.039
[Cowart]
Don't shake your finger at me, young man.

1:43:32.123 --> 1:43:34.709
Don't shake your finger at me, young man!

1:43:35.626 --> 1:43:38.045
[reporter 3] <i>But defense attorneys </i>
<i>have found Theodore Bundy</i>

1:43:38.129 --> 1:43:39.547
<i>to be a difficult client.</i>

1:43:40.840 --> 1:43:43.008
<i>Bundy appeared to find this humorous.</i>

1:43:45.594 --> 1:43:49.098
Um... he just seemed like a normal...

1:43:50.224 --> 1:43:52.309
a normal person that

1:43:52.435 --> 1:43:55.604
didn't seem like he would use
any kind of violence on anyone.

1:43:55.896 --> 1:43:57.940
[reporter 4]<i> The most important evidence</i>
<i> in the trial</i>

1:43:58.023 --> 1:43:59.650
<i>was the bite mark testimony.</i>

1:44:00.317 --> 1:44:03.028
And the bite mark, that was the most
damaging evidence.

1:44:05.531 --> 1:44:09.368
We're very satisfied with what
verdict we did get in this case.

1:44:09.452 --> 1:44:12.496
We couldn't have expected it
to be any better than it was.

1:44:12.580 --> 1:44:13.956
[Louise] <i>I consider it...</i>

1:44:14.373 --> 1:44:16.959
<i>the death penalty itself, to be...</i>

1:44:17.418 --> 1:44:19.712
the most primitive, barbaric thing

1:44:19.795 --> 1:44:23.632
that one human being 
can impose upon another.

1:44:24.258 --> 1:44:26.927
It's a tragedy for this court to see

1:44:27.052 --> 1:44:31.640
such a total waste of humanity 
that I've experienced in this court.

1:44:31.724 --> 1:44:33.476
You're a bright young man.

1:44:34.518 --> 1:44:35.770
You'd have made a good lawyer.

1:44:35.853 --> 1:44:37.897
<i>I'd have loved to have you practice</i>
<i>in front of me.</i>

1:44:38.063 --> 1:44:39.523
<i>But you went another way, partner.</i>

1:44:39.732 --> 1:44:42.818
[reporter 5]<i> The signal came early,</i>
<i>Ted Bundy was dead.</i>

1:44:43.360 --> 1:44:45.362
[crowd cheering]

1:44:45.654 --> 1:44:47.907
<i>Hundreds of onlookers</i>
<i>were in a festive mood.</i>

1:44:47.990 --> 1:44:49.950
<i>For the man who murdered </i>
<i>dozens of women,</i>

1:44:50.034 --> 1:44:52.244
<i>the irony of the final act of justice</i>

1:44:52.328 --> 1:44:55.331
<i>is that it may have been carried out </i>
<i>by a female executioner</i>

1:44:55.456 --> 1:44:58.167
<i>hidden from Bundy and others</i>
<i>by a black hood.</i>

1:44:59.919 --> 1:45:02.880
[interviewer] You don't change.
You stay Ted Bundy 24 hours a day?

1:45:02.963 --> 1:45:04.215
[laughs]

1:45:04.340 --> 1:45:05.257
Well...

1:45:05.758 --> 1:45:06.592
um...

1:45:07.051 --> 1:45:08.344
gee, that name sounds funny.

1:45:08.427 --> 1:45:11.222
You know, I hear Ted Bundy
in so many different contexts.

1:45:11.472 --> 1:45:12.473
I stay me.

1:45:14.016 --> 1:45:18.813
