18:43.300 --> 18:46.300
I'D LIKE TO HANG IT UP
RIGHT ABOUT HERE.

18:46.300 --> 18:49.734
HOW COULD YOU
AFFORD ALL THIS?

18:49.734 --> 18:52.700
I MADE SOME
WISE INVESTMENTS
WITH <i>MY </i>ALLOWANCE,

18:52.700 --> 18:55.133
WHILE OTHERS
INVESTED IN GUM,

18:55.133 --> 18:57.367
MOST OF WHICH IS
STILL ON THE FLOOR
OF OUR--

18:57.367 --> 18:59.967
EXCUSE ME--
<i>YOUR </i>ROOM.

18:59.967 --> 19:02.700
OK, SO MY ROOM'S
A LITTLE MESSY.

19:02.700 --> 19:05.900
A LITTLE? YOUR ROOM
SMELLS LIKE TOE JAM.

19:05.900 --> 19:07.367
ON A HOT DAY.

19:07.367 --> 19:08.567
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

19:08.567 --> 19:11.000

19:45.800 --> 19:48.200

19:48.200 --> 19:50.100
LIKE IT MAKES
A DIFFERENCE.

19:50.100 --> 19:53.133
DON'T BE AFRAID
TO REALLY DIG IN.

19:53.133 --> 19:54.934
OH, GOOD. GOOD.

19:54.934 --> 19:56.300
ABOUT THE DIPPING SAUCES,

19:56.300 --> 19:58.100

19:58.100 --> 19:59.500

20:01.000 --> 20:04.000
IN A TINY,
AIRLESS ROOM

20:04.000 --> 20:05.400
PACKED WITH
A MILLION PEOPLE

20:55.000 --> 20:58.100
I AM SO PROUD OF YOU.

20:58.100 --> 21:00.400
NOW GIVE ME BACK
MY QUARTER.

21:01.400 --> 21:04.934
IS IT SAFE TO COME IN?

21:04.934 --> 21:06.567
VERY FUNNY.

21:06.567 --> 21:08.000
WHOA!

21:08.000 --> 21:10.867
WHAT HAPPENED IN HERE?

21:10.867 --> 21:13.400
YOUR BROTHER HAS FINALLY
SEEN THE LIGHT.

21:13.400 --> 21:15.467
AND THE FLOOR.

21:15.467 --> 21:17.600
SO YOU CLEANED
THIS ENTIRE ROOM

21:17.600 --> 21:18.934
BY YOURSELF?

21:19.834 --> 21:20.967
YEAH.

21:20.967 --> 21:23.133
I'VE NEVER BEEN
SO TIRED IN MY LIFE.

21:23.133 --> 21:24.133
IMPRESSIVE.

21:24.133 --> 21:25.667
DO YOU MIND?

21:25.667 --> 21:27.300
I JUST MADE THAT.

21:27.300 --> 21:28.667
I'M DREAMING.

21:28.667 --> 21:31.467
NO ONE PINCH ME.

21:31.467 --> 21:33.934
I WAS THINKING.
IF YOU MOVE BACK,

21:33.934 --> 21:35.567
I COULD KEEP
MY SIDE CLEAN,

21:35.567 --> 21:36.934
YOU WOULD KEEP
YOUR SIDE CLEAN,

21:36.934 --> 21:39.500
AND I WOULDN'T HAVE
TO CLEAN BOTH SIDES.

21:39.500 --> 21:40.500
OK.

21:40.500 --> 21:42.100
WOW! THAT WAS EASY.

21:42.100 --> 21:43.567

NO.

21:44.734 --> 21:47.367
THE FIRE MARSHAL
SHUT ME DOWN.

21:47.367 --> 21:49.467
APPARENTLY THE MAXIMUM
OCCUPANCY OF MY CLOSET

21:49.467 --> 21:52.000
IS 3 COATS
AND AN UMBRELLA.

21:53.033 --> 21:54.600
SO WE'RE ROOMIES AGAIN?

21:54.600 --> 21:56.867
