This is the Persian Empire

00:41.699 --> 00:43.494
known today as Iran.

00:44.682 --> 00:48.542
For 2,500 years, this land
was ruled by a series of kings

00:48.947 --> 00:50.817
known as “Shahs‟.

00:51.724 --> 00:56.048
In 1950, the people of Iran
elected Mohammad Mosaddegh

00:56.298 --> 00:59.229
a secular democrat, as prime minister.

00:59.699 --> 01:03.029
He nationalized British and US
petroleum holdings,

01:03.299 --> 01:05.963
returning Iran’s oil to its people.

01:07.499 --> 01:09.229
But in 1953,

01:09.359 --> 01:12.118
the US and Great Britain
engineered a coup d’etat

01:12.189 --> 01:17.163
that deposed Mosaddegh,
and installed Reza Pahlavi as Shah.

01:18.451 --> 01:21.781
The young child was known
for opulence and excess.

01:22.138 --> 01:24.866
His wife was rumored to bathe in milk,

01:25.190 --> 01:29.191
while the Shah had his lunches
flown in by concord from Paris.

01:30.413 --> 01:31.998
The people starved.

01:34.360 --> 01:37.873
The Shah kept power through
his ruthless internal police,

01:38.030 --> 01:39.360
the Savak.

01:39.822 --> 01:42.881
An era of torture and fear began.

01:45.153 --> 01:48.627
He then began a campaign
to westernize Iran,

01:49.740 --> 01:53.648
enraging the the mostly
traditional Shia population.

01:54.175 --> 01:58.475
In 1979,
the people of Iran overthrew the Shah.

02:00.505 --> 02:05.045
The exiled cleric, Ayatollah Khomeini,
returned to rule Iran.

02:07.431 --> 02:13.259
It descended into score settling,
death squads and chaos.

02:15.831 --> 02:19.701
Dying of cancer, the Shah
was given asylum in the US.

02:21.545 --> 02:25.365
The Iranian people took
to the streets outside the US embassy,

02:25.435 --> 02:29.036
demanding that the Shah
be returned, tried…

02:30.446 --> 02:31.349
and hanged.

03:40.847 --> 03:43.361
The carnival is a
little bigger today, huh?

03:45.452 --> 03:47.815
The windows are supposed
to be bulletproof, right?

03:48.704 --> 03:50.154
They have never been tested.

03:50.498 --> 03:52.648
Okay, you just need to finish filling out

03:52.824 --> 03:54.174
this section here.

04:46.976 --> 04:48.556
We need some security.

04:48.656 --> 04:50.622
Yes, it is your responsibility—

04:50.630 --> 04:52.386
They drew over the walls.

04:52.476 --> 04:53.576
We should all split.

04:53.756 --> 04:55.047
I’m gonna close up my office.

05:14.870 --> 05:15.788
My God!

05:16.887 --> 05:18.087
Marins to Number 1.

05:18.357 --> 05:19.047
Full back.

05:19.069 --> 05:19.898
— Look, I need police,
— Can anyone hear me?

05:19.899 --> 05:20.817
— I need police right now.
— We’re on the second floor.

05:20.827 --> 05:21.598
— You understand me?
— We need help.

05:21.607 --> 05:22.737
Right now, goddamn it!

05:23.049 --> 05:24.745
Can anybody hear me?

05:24.746 --> 05:25.577
There is a breach.

05:27.765 --> 05:29.208
Burn everything! Burn it, now!

05:29.216 --> 05:32.177
Alright burn everything,
all the files, file cabinets, safe.

05:46.968 --> 05:48.066
Lets get a cart over here.

05:48.067 --> 05:49.168
Burn it all, come on!

05:49.198 --> 05:51.556
Burn everything, including
the classified. Everything!

05:57.028 --> 05:58.878
Don’t fucking shoot anybody.

05:59.113 --> 06:01.621
You don’t want to be
the son of a bitch who started the war.

06:01.860 --> 06:03.573
They need an hour to burn the classified.

06:04.624 --> 06:05.526
I need you to hold.

06:05.828 --> 06:07.038
If you shoot one person,

06:07.528 --> 06:09.638
they’re gonna kill every
single one of us in here.

06:18.729 --> 06:21.506
I’m telling you if we’re going to go,
we need to go now!

06:21.513 --> 06:23.658
— And we need to make a decision, and—
— Joe can we— Joe can we wait,

06:23.668 --> 06:25.419
can we wait until
the Iranian police come?

06:25.425 --> 06:26.839
— No!
— They’re not coming.

06:27.639 --> 06:28.699
How do you know they’re not coming?

06:28.709 --> 06:29.722
They may well be coming.

06:29.738 --> 06:31.028
The police have abandoned their post—

06:31.036 --> 06:33.557
If the police are not coming, okay,
then the army’s gonna come.

06:33.565 --> 06:34.399
The Prime Minister is not gonna let
the embassy be taken over.

06:34.409 --> 06:37.017
I understand. The Prime Minister
may come tomorrow,

06:37.018 --> 06:38.497
but the Komiteh are here today.

06:38.498 --> 06:40.659
Alright, is there—is there any value
that we’re waiting 15—

06:40.670 --> 06:41.429
Look at me!

06:41.640 --> 06:42.730
No one is coming.

06:42.756 --> 06:44.155
Burn it!
We have forty minutes.

06:47.130 --> 06:49.630
Get it down to the incinerator,
in the vault. Now!

06:49.687 --> 06:51.497
Tear gas is a last resort only.

06:51.531 --> 06:54.190
<i>I repeat: only if you’re under threat.</i>

07:31.623 --> 07:36.097
In here, we are in America right now,
outside of these doors, we are in Iran!

07:36.098 --> 07:37.026
I’m not going out there!

07:37.027 --> 07:38.794
— They’re not safe here.
 Alright, first let’s get these—

07:38.811 --> 07:40.969
If they get caught
applying for visas to the US…

07:40.977 --> 07:42.460
You know what, lets—
lets wait five minutes.

07:42.475 --> 07:44.842
We’re in the only building
with direct access to the street,

07:44.843 --> 07:46.842
if we’re going to go,
then we need to go now!

07:47.082 --> 07:48.586
— Yeah, I’m in.
— Yeah.

07:48.619 --> 07:49.420
Yeah, lets go.

07:54.607 --> 07:55.512
I’m going outside.

07:55.795 --> 07:56.442
Why?

07:56.592 --> 07:57.812
To reason them.

08:24.511 --> 08:25.440
Open the door!

08:26.575 --> 08:27.723
Open the door!

08:28.143 --> 08:29.723
Open this goddamn door!

08:31.599 --> 08:33.863
You said you wanna see the world, Elton?

08:34.239 --> 08:36.731
Let me in! Let me in!

08:44.760 --> 08:46.578
— Burn it all, come on!
— Right come on, guys!

08:46.592 --> 08:49.054
The safe and the filing cabinets get long.

08:56.774 --> 08:59.074
All four drawers,
I want them shredded, right now!

08:59.075 --> 09:00.470
But the shred not fast enough.

09:01.381 --> 09:03.493
Guys, get the visa plates.

09:04.453 --> 09:06.955
All four, and anything
else you see out there.

09:07.472 --> 09:09.312
If in doubt, you shred it.

09:11.692 --> 09:14.491
We’ve got ten minutes,
lets go, go, go, everything!

09:24.237 --> 09:24.981
Get the shredder.

09:25.003 --> 09:26.608
There are no police.

10:31.437 --> 10:32.244
— Okay.
— Come on.

10:32.252 --> 10:34.395
— Where do we go?
— We gotta get off the streets.

10:34.883 --> 10:36.379
This way, up here to the left.

11:06.856 --> 11:08.538
These fucks hit us,
we can’t hit ‘em back?

11:08.539 --> 11:10.538
Mossaddegh, we did it to them first.

11:10.567 --> 11:12.628
The Soviets would put up with this shit,
they would fucking invade them.

11:12.651 --> 11:13.273
Shaffer!

11:13.275 --> 11:16.014
Sir, what d’you expect? We helped the guy
torture and deball an entire population.

11:16.029 --> 11:16.778
How many were there?

11:16.858 --> 11:18.448
At least fifty. We’re not sure.

11:19.044 --> 11:19.769
Shaffer!

11:19.785 --> 11:21.026
You still haven’t found Shaffer?

11:21.045 --> 11:23.241
No I was screaming his name
’cos I was fucking ‘em.

11:26.759 --> 11:28.379
It’s confirmed, sir, six escaped.

11:28.419 --> 11:29.559
I was told five.

11:29.619 --> 11:30.929
Now sir, apparently it’s six.

11:31.149 --> 11:31.889
So what happened?

11:31.890 --> 11:33.959
Not clear. We know they
escaped the embassy.

11:34.099 --> 11:34.801
Where are they?

11:34.859 --> 11:36.378
The Canadian Ambassador’s house.

11:36.379 --> 11:38.142
Do they stay put?
Are we attempting a rescue?

11:38.169 --> 11:39.656
I put through the Secretary of State.

11:39.937 --> 11:40.737
Yes.

11:41.027 --> 11:42.191
Is White House joining?

11:42.207 --> 11:44.281
They’re claiming the Embassy
was a den of espionage.

11:44.286 --> 11:45.968
We wish it was a fucking den of espionage.

11:45.986 --> 11:48.754
CIA’s got three people over there,
they don’t see a revolution coming?

11:48.765 --> 11:50.452
Call it something other then intelligence.

11:50.493 --> 11:52.166
Hold for the Chief of Staff.
Harding?

11:52.240 --> 11:53.031
I’ll call him back.

11:53.285 --> 11:55.850
They’re sticking to it, no release
till we expel the Shah.

11:55.864 --> 11:57.298
Well, put him on a plane then, fuck him!

11:57.313 --> 11:58.695
He’s half dead and he’s in chemo.

11:58.909 --> 12:00.592
Well, we took him in, he’s ours now.

12:00.672 --> 12:03.042
Great, so we’ll take any prick
as long as he’s got cancer?

12:03.190 --> 12:04.570
Just the pricks on our side.

12:05.030 --> 12:06.858
So all of our other pricks
on their prick thrones

12:06.859 --> 12:08.297
will know that when they
get thrown out on a rail,

12:08.305 --> 12:09.894
they won’t get their
fucking spleens taken out

12:09.902 --> 12:11.730
by some camel vet in Sinai.

12:11.924 --> 12:13.827
What about the six who are
with the Canadians?

12:15.510 --> 12:17.838
We’ve got sixty in the Embassy
with guns to their heads right now.

12:17.839 --> 12:19.108
The whole world is
watching the Embassy.

12:19.109 --> 12:20.591
That makes them safer
than the six on the street.

12:20.601 --> 12:22.933
Bonnie Sauder’s saying
it will be over in twenty-four hours.

12:26.641 --> 12:27.881
We leave the six where they are.

12:28.381 --> 12:29.881
I’ll go brief the President.

12:32.355 --> 12:34.175
Right, I’ll through it.

13:02.542 --> 13:06.270
<i>Iran’s Revolutionary Guard, has
rounded up a gang of terrorist blamed</i>

13:06.277 --> 13:10.097
<i>for one murder of a half-dozen
followers of Ayatollah Khomeini.</i>

13:10.622 --> 13:14.341
<i>It says security at Khomeini’s home
now has been raised.</i>

13:14.342 --> 13:19.271
<i>This by the way, is the 69th day that the
American hostages have been held in Tehran,</i>

13:19.272 --> 13:22.942
<i>there is no change reported
in the hostage situation.</i>

13:23.142 --> 13:26.847
<i>In this country, George Mitty died last
night, he was eighty five years old.</i>

13:28.573 --> 13:29.573
Yeah.

13:31.233 --> 13:32.033
Yes.

13:35.248 --> 13:35.983
What?

13:36.223 --> 13:38.723
<i>To begin with, of course,
we wanted to learn</i>

13:38.823 --> 13:42.182
<i>about the hostages held in
the American Embassy compound.</i>

13:42.183 --> 13:45.823
<i>They may not understand what their
ordeal means to their countrymen.</i>

13:45.923 --> 13:48.353
<i>That this nation,
their nation, is outraged.</i>

13:48.412 --> 13:50.909
<i>And we cannot really
know what it is like</i>

13:50.923 --> 13:53.623
<i>inside the prison
that was once our embassy.</i>

13:54.053 --> 13:58.496
<i>Actions of Iran have shocked
the civilized world.</i>

13:58.854 --> 14:04.344
<i>Our embassy has been seized, and
more than sixty American citizens</i>

14:04.381 --> 14:06.254
<i>continue to be held as hostages—</i>

14:06.255 --> 14:10.454
<i>As the situation in Iran this morning
is unchanged for the hostages—</i>

14:10.754 --> 14:13.924
<i>the NBC situation in Iran
has changed however—</i>

14:25.191 --> 14:26.038
What happened?

14:27.095 --> 14:29.405
Six of them went out a back exit.

14:29.805 --> 14:31.264
Brits turned them away,

14:31.265 --> 14:34.005
Kiwis turned them away,
Canadians took ‘em in.

14:34.205 --> 14:36.325
Traffic calls them ‘House Guests’.

14:36.377 --> 14:39.774
They haven’t left the Canadian
Ambassador’s house since it happened.

14:39.775 --> 14:41.293
Why didn’t we get them ten weeks ago?

14:41.294 --> 14:42.125
Too dangerous.

14:42.157 --> 14:45.695
We got revolutionary guards going
door to door, like Jehovah’s Witnesses.

14:45.835 --> 14:49.404
Half of them think that Khomeini’s been
too lenient on the ones in the Embassy.

14:49.405 --> 14:50.514
What about the White House?

14:50.605 --> 14:53.175
Carter’s shitting enough bricks
to build the pyramids.

14:53.525 --> 14:55.174
The Canadians are done,

14:55.175 --> 14:56.663
they say they’re baring too much risk.

14:56.664 --> 14:58.726
Their Foreign Secretary
corners Vance in Brussels,

14:58.727 --> 15:01.525
and told him she wants
the six of them out.

15:01.526 --> 15:02.546
Who else knows?

15:02.576 --> 15:03.945
Just the families.

15:03.946 --> 15:06.095
Meanwhile, some genius in our Embassy

15:06.096 --> 15:08.496
was keeping a mug book on
everybody who worked there.

15:08.636 --> 15:10.036
Jesus Christ!

15:10.054 --> 15:12.375
We think it got shredded
before they got in.

15:12.376 --> 15:14.495
But now the bastards are using

15:14.496 --> 15:16.975
sweatshop kids
to reassemble the shreds.

15:16.976 --> 15:20.435
Once they reassemble that book,
they’ll know six Americans got out

15:20.436 --> 15:22.036
and they’ll know what they look like.

15:22.037 --> 15:24.575
Standing room only for
beheadings in the square.

15:24.576 --> 15:25.696
Who’s handling?

15:26.576 --> 15:28.576
State is coordinating in-house.

15:29.467 --> 15:30.327
State?

15:31.267 --> 15:32.327
They don’t do exfil’s.

15:32.328 --> 15:33.406
They do now.

15:33.407 --> 15:36.147
They wanna run it by us,
strictly as consultants.

15:36.237 --> 15:38.207
Engell says, it’s a lose–lose.

15:38.347 --> 15:39.637
These people die,

15:39.638 --> 15:41.637
they die badly, publicly.

15:42.067 --> 15:43.347
State wants the blame,

15:43.437 --> 15:44.377
we’ll give it to ‘em.

15:45.207 --> 15:46.607
What does he want me here for?

15:46.777 --> 15:50.037
So he can tell State
he ran it by his best exfil guy.

15:56.377 --> 15:57.577
Okay.

15:58.037 --> 16:00.867
This is Bob Pender from State OS,

16:00.868 --> 16:02.868
he’s been talking
to Morgan, an ex-staff.

16:04.098 --> 16:04.868
Thank you.

16:05.838 --> 16:06.638
Alright.

16:07.438 --> 16:10.548
Mark and Cora Lijek,
twenty-nine and twenty-five,

16:10.549 --> 16:13.838
he’s a Consular Officer, she’s
an assistant, newly weds,

16:14.128 --> 16:16.728
They uh… only just got
there a couple months ago,

16:17.068 --> 16:20.697
No language skills
or in-country knowledge.

16:20.698 --> 16:22.097
Henry Lee Schatz,

16:22.148 --> 16:24.437
Agricultural attaché from Idaho,

16:24.438 --> 16:26.438
a bit of an oddball apparently,

16:26.528 --> 16:30.038
he was there to sell U.S.
tractors to Iranian agro.

16:30.148 --> 16:32.239
Joe Stafford, late twenties

16:32.469 --> 16:33.349
he’s smart

16:33.499 --> 16:35.439
and a climber, speaks Farsi,

16:35.839 --> 16:37.839
he arranged the hire of his wife,

16:38.069 --> 16:38.898
Kathy.

16:38.899 --> 16:40.239
The Embassy was understaffed,

16:40.240 --> 16:42.239
so the faculty wives
were the typing pool.

16:42.240 --> 16:43.549
And Bob Anders,

16:43.609 --> 16:45.928
senior consular officer,
oldest of the group,

16:45.929 --> 16:47.699
and most likely to be group leader.

16:47.700 --> 16:50.329
They’ve been hiding at the
Canadian Ambassador’s residence.

16:50.869 --> 16:54.748
Fortunately, we do not believe the
Iranians are aware the six have escaped.

16:54.749 --> 16:55.549
So…

16:56.414 --> 16:59.239
What we’d like for this are bicycles.

16:59.749 --> 17:02.730
We’ve identified back roads
from the Chamran district,

17:02.731 --> 17:05.069
couple of rat lines
through the mountains

17:05.069 --> 17:06.638
to the crossing near Tabriz.

17:06.640 --> 17:08.729
Cars are off the table,

17:08.730 --> 17:10.208
because of the road blocks.

17:10.209 --> 17:11.667
We wait until the weather clears up,

17:11.669 --> 17:13.040
then deliver the six bikes,

17:13.040 --> 17:15.040
provide them with maps
to the Turkish border.

17:15.040 --> 17:17.549
We have intelligence,
they can ride bicycles

17:17.550 --> 17:20.435
or we’re prepared to send in
somebody to teach ‘em.

17:28.329 --> 17:32.130
Or you could just send in training wheels
and meet them at the border with Gatorade.

17:32.240 --> 17:33.040
Tony…

17:33.531 --> 17:35.611
It’s three hundred miles
to the Turkish border.

17:35.781 --> 17:38.410
They’d need a support team
following them with a tire pump.

17:38.411 --> 17:42.186
We were just asked to sharp shoot this,
State is handling the ops.

17:42.202 --> 17:43.981
I’m sorry, who is this?

17:44.101 --> 17:45.730
Tony is an exfil spesh,

17:45.731 --> 17:48.470
he’s got a lot of Shah’s
people out after the fall.

17:48.471 --> 17:51.041
Sir, if these people can read or add,

17:51.241 --> 17:53.901
pretty soon they’re gonna figure out
they’re six short of a full deck.

17:54.551 --> 17:57.009
It’s winter. You can’t afford
to wait around until spring,

17:57.010 --> 17:58.531
so it’s nice enough
to take a bike ride.

17:58.641 --> 18:00.531
They only way out
of that city is the airport.

18:00.781 --> 18:02.329
You build new cover identities for ‘em,

18:02.330 --> 18:04.502
you send in a Moses, he takes
them out on a commercial flight.

18:05.042 --> 18:06.387
We’ve explored those options.

18:06.395 --> 18:09.265
You’re never gonna get them through
airport control, Komiteh own the place.

18:09.289 --> 18:12.780
They could pose as reporters, if the
government issued seventy something…

18:12.781 --> 18:13.730
— Seventy four.
— Visas,

18:13.731 --> 18:15.552
— for American journalists…
— And the Revolutionary Guards

18:15.553 --> 18:17.131
keep them on seventy four leashes.

18:17.132 --> 18:19.132
If they’re caught with
fake journalist creds,

18:19.248 --> 18:21.272
it’s Peter and Jane’s head
in a noose in an hour.

18:21.273 --> 18:24.071
Look, North America accents
gives us limited options,

18:24.072 --> 18:25.675
so we get the Canadians
to issue them passports.

18:25.676 --> 18:28.252
What about English teachers
at the international school?

18:28.268 --> 18:30.450
It’s a good idea, but that school’s
been closed for eight months.

18:30.451 --> 18:33.012
Okay, so how about
’the do-gooders’?

18:34.702 --> 18:36.185
Six Canadians have been over there

18:36.193 --> 18:38.583
inspecting crops, ensuring the kids
are getting enough to eat,

18:38.584 --> 18:41.353
we give them creds, makes
them look like ag’ NGOs.

18:41.503 --> 18:43.353
It’s a ‘feed the kids’ thing.

18:43.783 --> 18:44.241
Okay.

18:44.242 --> 18:45.473
Those kids are black.

18:46.333 --> 18:47.702
Those are African kids.

18:47.703 --> 18:49.782
We can get ethnically appropriate kids.

18:49.783 --> 18:51.502
Are there starving kids in Iran?

18:51.503 --> 18:54.043
I’m sure there’s some
skinny kids in Iran.

18:54.279 --> 18:55.848
What about missionary?
— Or… seeds…

18:55.904 --> 18:57.403
called… “seeds of hope‟.

18:57.473 --> 19:00.328
Hold on… Sir, do you have
this newspaper in front of you?

19:00.344 --> 19:01.924
Would you mind taking a look at it?

19:03.613 --> 19:04.983
What’s in this picture?

19:05.613 --> 19:06.301
Tehran.

19:06.302 --> 19:07.674
Right.
What’s on the ground?

19:10.274 --> 19:11.904
— Snow.
— Right.

19:12.044 --> 19:15.644
So what crops are the ‘do-gooders’
inspecting under frosting?

19:17.444 --> 19:18.134
Sir…

19:18.904 --> 19:20.584
Exfils are like abortions.

19:20.874 --> 19:22.214
You don’t wanna need one.

19:22.554 --> 19:25.104
But when you do,
you don’t do it yourself.

19:30.554 --> 19:32.014
You have a better plan?

19:33.244 --> 19:34.288
No Sir.

19:37.955 --> 19:40.484
<i>What ever the conflicting
signals from Iran today,</i>

19:40.492 --> 19:41.952
<i>for that matter everyday,</i>

19:41.960 --> 19:45.674
<i>about whether the hostages will
or will not be tried as spies,</i>

19:45.675 --> 19:49.585
<i>the government of the United States
has not deviated from its basic demands:</i>

19:49.755 --> 19:51.542
<i>the hostages must be freed.</i>

19:51.543 --> 19:52.785
.. to defend human rights,

19:52.786 --> 19:54.874
it not only does not defend them,

19:54.875 --> 19:57.614
it violates them for all nations.

19:57.615 --> 20:02.674
We demand extradition of a man
who for more than 37 years,

20:02.675 --> 20:05.965
with the United States support,
has killed months old babies

20:05.966 --> 20:07.704
in the arms of their mothers.

20:07.705 --> 20:11.905
<i>He said that if the Americans try
military force to rescue the hostages,</i>

20:11.906 --> 20:15.276
<i>the students will kill them all
and blow up the Embassy.</i>

20:16.476 --> 20:19.768
<i>Americans were outraged
at Iran and anyone Iranian.</i>

20:19.784 --> 20:22.706
<i>Before this decision was taken,
there was a demonstration in Houston.</i>

20:22.707 --> 20:26.133
<i>An Iranian flag was burned,
while Anti-Iranians demonstrators</i>

20:26.141 --> 20:28.734
<i>gathered near the Iranian
Consulate. The demonstrators—</i>

20:28.756 --> 20:32.230
<i>.. also it’s what led to a decision
to scrutinize the bases of the Iranian—</i>

20:32.246 --> 20:35.354
They knew exactly what
was going on, they knew it.

20:35.355 --> 20:37.924
But I don’t understand wha—
what they should do now,

20:37.940 --> 20:40.597
send them back, just to—
to be tortured and killed?

20:40.598 --> 20:42.401
I don’t think that justice
is the worst thing.

20:42.402 --> 20:46.172
<i>When did people first tell you
that torture was going on in Iran?</i>

20:46.177 --> 20:47.722
<i>They would never come to me and say:</i>

20:47.738 --> 20:50.476
<i>“Well Sir, we have tortured this fellow‟.</i>

20:50.477 --> 20:53.847
<i>.. Sadat of Egypt he calls you Imam,</i>

20:53.982 --> 20:57.757
<i>forgive me, his words not mine: A lunatic.</i>

20:57.907 --> 21:00.619
Why didn’t he have a choice,
why do you think he didn’t have a choice?

21:00.627 --> 21:02.475
Because he would have been
referred to as a barbarian.

21:02.476 --> 21:03.497
— Please!
— That’s why they’re stating

21:03.505 --> 21:05.137
he liked the current regime!

21:05.399 --> 21:07.193
The Shah did more for women’s right—

21:07.213 --> 21:08.383
I think we’ve better if…

21:08.617 --> 21:10.829
Please everyone, get into the coal.

21:27.818 --> 21:28.618
<i>.. Get out of here!</i>

21:28.625 --> 21:30.876
<i>At one point the mob
cornered one of Iranians.</i>

21:30.877 --> 21:34.138
<i>When he tried to protect
himself, this is what happened.</i>

21:35.278 --> 21:36.248
<i>Hit him again!</i>

21:36.678 --> 21:38.338
<i>Hit him until he can’t take it anymore!</i>

21:38.339 --> 21:40.338
<i>We’re sick of them!
— Yeah!</i>

21:41.108 --> 21:42.559
<i>America!</i>

21:42.679 --> 21:44.661
<i>.. even in our little community here,</i>

21:44.709 --> 21:47.939
<i>I mean people are drawn
uptight, they’re tense.</i>

21:48.619 --> 21:52.109
<i>They shouldn’t even let those
students in that Embassy there.</i>

21:52.759 --> 21:55.159
<i>Just shoot a couple of ‘em.
Show ‘em we mean business.</i>

21:55.739 --> 21:59.387
<i>Men who served in Vietnam for what
they believed was right are angry.</i>

21:59.388 --> 22:00.449
<i>I’m mad as hell.</i>

22:00.479 --> 22:04.244
<i>I’m—I’m like the guy screaming on that
movie program in ‘network’ you know,</i>

22:04.292 --> 22:06.694
<i>I’ve had it! And if huh…</i>

22:06.909 --> 22:09.019
<i>if need be I’ll bear arms again!</i>

22:09.359 --> 22:12.989
<i>That’s the way it is,
Wednesday, January 16th, 1980.</i>

22:13.310 --> 22:17.340
<i>74th day of captivity
for 50 Americans in Iran.</i>

22:25.940 --> 22:26.739
Hello?

22:26.740 --> 22:27.680
My man!

22:27.960 --> 22:29.050
I’ll get mom.

22:29.764 --> 22:30.833
I’m calling for you.

22:33.110 --> 22:34.650
Did you do your homework tonight?

22:34.820 --> 22:35.790
Yeah it was easy.

22:36.280 --> 22:37.789
Excellent.
What are we watching?

22:37.813 --> 22:39.213
Battle for the Planet of the Apes.

22:40.020 --> 22:41.420
Tell me, what channel is it on?

22:41.740 --> 22:42.560
Five.

22:47.161 --> 22:47.941
Alright.

22:49.851 --> 22:51.312
What did you do at school today?

22:51.451 --> 22:53.051
Nothing, I don’t know.
Nothing.

22:55.161 --> 22:57.851
It can’t be nothing.
Something must’ve happened.

22:57.921 --> 22:59.625
After school I’ve traded baseball cards—

22:59.673 --> 23:00.879
Hmm–Hmm…

23:18.980 --> 23:21.506
Ok you know those science
fiction, Star Trek, Star Wars,

23:21.514 --> 23:23.362
they need an exotic location to shoot,

23:23.363 --> 23:25.362
Moonscape, Mars, desert, you know…

23:25.912 --> 23:27.092
Now image this.

23:28.422 --> 23:32.542
They’re a Canadian film crew on a location
scout for a science fiction movie.

23:33.112 --> 23:34.282
We put it out there,

23:34.452 --> 23:36.282
the Canadian producers
put it out there.

23:36.392 --> 23:38.822
They were looking at Egypt, Istanbul.

23:39.562 --> 23:43.512
Then we go to the Consulate and say:
’Hey, we want to look in Iran too’.

23:43.912 --> 23:47.223
I fly into Tehran, we all fly
out together as a film crew.

23:47.763 --> 23:48.343
Done.

23:48.344 --> 23:50.691
Flamboyant cover identity
should be avoided

23:50.699 --> 23:52.397
as it increases operational visibility.

23:52.405 --> 23:53.799
This is a lot more
plausible than foreigners

23:53.807 --> 23:55.341
who wanna become teachers in Iran.

23:55.342 --> 23:58.051
You want to blend in with the population
you don’t look like a rodeo clown.

23:58.052 --> 24:00.881
Just gonna wake up tomorrow morning
and be in the movie business?

24:00.882 --> 24:02.713
We already have credentials
for the teachers.

24:02.793 --> 24:04.191
No Sir, we have a contact in—

24:04.192 --> 24:05.591
— Chambers.
— John Chambers,

24:05.592 --> 24:08.018
he’s a Hollywood prosthetics guy, he’s got
an Oscar, he did Planet of the Apes

24:08.026 --> 24:10.283
he’s done a bunch of contract
work for us in the past.

24:11.163 --> 24:13.023
I go see him, he sets this up.

24:13.024 --> 24:15.113
One, two days, make it look real.

24:30.194 --> 24:31.624
I went outside for thirty seconds.

24:31.884 --> 24:32.362
Alright?

24:32.363 --> 24:34.254
Could you give me a break?
I can’t breath in this house.

24:34.255 --> 24:36.313
I need some fresh air,
I can’t—I can’t breath!

24:36.314 --> 24:37.562
Stay inside the fucking house!

24:37.563 --> 24:38.695
Who saw me go outside, I’m just curious?

24:38.703 --> 24:40.068
— That’s not the point.
— That’s not the point Bob.

24:40.084 --> 24:41.566
Doesn’t matter if I saw you
go out or you see me.

24:41.574 --> 24:43.391
— Did you see me go out?
— No! You did go outside…

24:43.399 --> 24:45.239
I did. Okay, I saw you.

24:45.247 --> 24:48.484
Bob, it only takes one
second for them to spot you.

24:53.485 --> 24:55.565
Some Americans are missing.

24:55.965 --> 24:57.962
Look at the repaired list
of embassy employees.

24:58.795 --> 25:00.315
The numbers don’t match.

25:00.625 --> 25:03.995
Finish assembling the
pictures from the Embassy.

25:04.115 --> 25:06.625
All I need is their faces
and I will find them.

25:06.685 --> 25:08.485
Yes Sir, it’ll be done.

25:20.746 --> 25:22.366
We want you to go to LA.

25:22.516 --> 25:25.546
If you can make the movie thing
credible, we’ll take it to the director.

25:26.746 --> 25:27.546
Don’t fuck up.

25:28.346 --> 25:30.026
The whole country is watching you.

25:30.916 --> 25:32.256
They just don’t know it.

25:39.826 --> 25:41.546
My creation…

25:42.596 --> 25:44.056
My creation!

25:50.566 --> 25:51.627
What the fuck, Bryan?

25:51.628 --> 25:53.257
— Cut!
— We are cutting!

25:56.717 --> 25:57.887
Chambers!

25:57.947 --> 25:59.887
John Chambers make up!

26:11.567 --> 26:15.257
He says the minotaur prosthetic
is too tight so he can’t act.

26:15.917 --> 26:18.367
If he could act, he wouldn’t
be playing a minotaur.

26:24.568 --> 26:25.688
Mr. Chambers…

26:26.658 --> 26:27.688
Kevin Arkins.

26:30.028 --> 26:31.058
Hey Tony.

26:57.169 --> 26:58.569
What are you shooting?

26:59.059 --> 27:00.569
Monster movie.

27:01.749 --> 27:03.949
Yeah? Any good?

27:04.629 --> 27:06.289
Target audience will hate it.

27:06.489 --> 27:08.289
Who’s the target audience?

27:08.369 --> 27:09.349
People with eyes.

27:12.549 --> 27:13.519
Talk to me.

27:15.719 --> 27:16.829
It’s an exfil.

27:17.229 --> 27:18.089
From where?

27:19.489 --> 27:21.149
Worst place you can think of.

27:21.349 --> 27:23.149
Universal Studio.

27:29.260 --> 27:31.030
How are you gonna get in the Embassy?

27:31.170 --> 27:32.290
They’re not in the Embassy.

27:32.490 --> 27:34.600
During the takeover six people escaped.

27:34.770 --> 27:36.600
They’re hiding out in Tehran…

27:37.299 --> 27:38.590
and that’s who I’m gonna go get.

27:38.613 --> 27:39.893
What am I making?

27:41.060 --> 27:43.010
I need you to help me
make a fake movie.

27:43.050 --> 27:45.370
Well, you’re in the right place.

27:45.970 --> 27:49.119
I wanna setup a production company
and build a cover around making a movie.

27:49.120 --> 27:51.120
— That we’re not gonna make.
— No.

27:51.720 --> 27:54.136
So you wanna come to
Hollywood and act like a big shot,

27:54.137 --> 27:54.646
Yeah.

27:54.654 --> 27:56.274
— without actually doing anything.
— No.

27:56.291 --> 27:57.601
You’ll fit right in.

28:03.801 --> 28:05.061
Let’s see.

28:06.119 --> 28:09.430
Well this one has got an M.A. in English,
she should be your screenwriter.

28:09.431 --> 28:12.601
Sometimes they go along on scouts
because they want their free meals.

28:12.661 --> 28:14.121
Here’s your director.

28:14.571 --> 28:16.691
Can you teach somebody
to be a director in a day?

28:16.692 --> 28:19.401
You teach a recess monkey
to be a director in a day.

28:19.891 --> 28:22.891
Look if you’re gonna do this,
you gotta do it.

28:23.091 --> 28:25.521
The Kominiacs are fruit loops,
but they got cousins

28:25.533 --> 28:28.262
who sell prayer rugs
and A-tracks on Le Brea.

28:28.862 --> 28:32.292
You can’t build cover stories
around a movie that doesn’t exist.

28:32.462 --> 28:34.632
You need a script, you need a producer.

28:34.722 --> 28:35.662
Make me a producer.

28:35.772 --> 28:38.602
No. You’re… an
associate producer at best.

28:40.152 --> 28:43.152
You’re gonna do a 20 million
dollars Star Wars rip-off.

28:43.402 --> 28:46.862
You need somebody who’s a somebody,
to put their name on it.

28:47.202 --> 28:48.862
Somebody respectable…

28:50.372 --> 28:51.292
with credits…

28:52.632 --> 28:55.092
who you can trust
with classified information…

28:56.202 --> 28:58.263
who’d produce a fake movie…

28:59.093 --> 29:00.263
for free.

29:13.893 --> 29:15.633
Hi, I only got a couple of minutes.

29:15.663 --> 29:17.403
I’m getting a lifetime
achievement award.

29:17.493 --> 29:18.723
Mazel tov, Lester.

29:19.123 --> 29:22.493
I’d rather stay home and count
the wrinkles on my dog’s balls.

29:23.063 --> 29:24.033
Okay.

29:24.173 --> 29:27.210
You got six people hiding out
in a town of what… 4 million people,

29:27.218 --> 29:31.064
all of whom chant death to
America’ all the live long day.

29:31.204 --> 29:33.034
You want to set up a movie in a week,

29:33.094 --> 29:36.554
you want to lie to Hollywood,
a town where everybody lies for a living,

29:36.664 --> 29:39.264
then you’re gonna sneak 007 over here,

29:39.354 --> 29:42.804
into a country that wants CIA
blood on their breakfast cereal,

29:42.826 --> 29:46.464
and you’re gonna walk the Brady Bunch
out of the most watched city in the world.

29:46.664 --> 29:49.464
That’s about a hundred militia
at the airport. That’s right.

29:50.864 --> 29:51.924
Right.

29:53.924 --> 29:55.664
Look I… I got to tell ya,

29:55.804 --> 29:59.554
we—we did suicide missions in the
Army that had better odds than this.

29:59.634 --> 30:01.065
Sir, the car is here.

30:09.065 --> 30:11.635
You ever think, Lester,
this is all for the cameras?

30:12.375 --> 30:15.165
Well, they’re getting the ratings,
I’ll say that for them.

30:27.265 --> 30:28.993
We’re going to need a script.

30:59.156 --> 31:00.096
I love you.

31:10.067 --> 31:12.237
Sahar, how are you doing?

31:12.957 --> 31:14.437
Fine, thank you.

31:15.957 --> 31:18.145
Your friends from Canada, ma’am,

31:18.264 --> 31:20.177
all this time, they never go out.

31:35.378 --> 31:36.852
Sahar knows.

31:40.758 --> 31:42.728
How about ‘The Horses of Achilles’?

31:42.808 --> 31:45.668
Νо gооd. Νоbоdy dоеѕ wеѕtеrnѕ аnymоrе.

31:45.758 --> 31:46.958
It’s ancient Troy.

31:47.204 --> 31:49.178
If it’s got horses in it,
it’s a western.

31:50.158 --> 31:51.468
Hey, Kenny please?

31:51.608 --> 31:53.728
Yeah it’s John Chambers,
about the office space.

31:53.778 --> 31:54.868
It doesn’t matter.

31:55.208 --> 31:56.298
It’s a fake movie.

31:56.408 --> 31:59.298
If I’m doing a fake movie,
it’s going to be a fake hit.

32:00.128 --> 32:03.838
Cardinal wants all cover options
on his desk Friday morning.

32:03.898 --> 32:07.409
Engell’s prepping the bikes option,
teachers option,

32:07.439 --> 32:09.839
you have 72 hours to make yours better.

32:11.159 --> 32:11.990
Fine.

32:36.870 --> 32:40.360
Hey is 8006 still on the open list?

32:41.700 --> 32:42.700
Yeah I’ll hold.

32:42.930 --> 32:44.810
Fade in on a starship landing.

32:44.930 --> 32:47.010
An exotic Middle Eastern vibe.

32:47.160 --> 32:51.100
Women gather offering ecstatic
libations to the sky gods.

32:51.530 --> 32:52.330
Argo.

32:52.560 --> 32:54.130
“A Science–Fantasy Adventure.‟

32:54.780 --> 32:56.627
It’s a turnaround, it’s dog shit.

32:56.635 --> 32:59.000
It’s a space movie in the Middle East.
Does it matter if—

32:59.010 --> 33:00.100
Could we get the option?

33:00.780 --> 33:02.070
Why do we need the option?

33:02.500 --> 33:04.070
You’re worried about the Ayatollah?

33:04.180 --> 33:06.070
Try the WGA.

33:08.381 --> 33:09.561
Just let me do the talking.

33:09.731 --> 33:13.284
I’ve known this guy for 25 years,
he’s full of shit, and he comes on hard,

33:13.300 --> 33:15.211
but uh… I can handle it.

33:17.011 --> 33:19.561
You want to go into production
with this in one month?

33:19.671 --> 33:21.301
Up like a carny ride.

33:21.361 --> 33:22.381
One month, yeah.

33:22.561 --> 33:25.041
— Who are you again?
— Kevin Arkins, Studio 6 Films.

33:25.181 --> 33:25.981
He’s the money.

33:26.731 --> 33:28.611
Look, what d’you say uh…

33:28.671 --> 33:32.131
fifteen thou’and, let’s close on this?

33:33.761 --> 33:35.471
You want me to be honest with you, Les?

33:35.561 --> 33:37.841
No. I would like you to bullshit me, Max.

33:38.412 --> 33:38.962
Alright.

33:40.242 --> 33:42.362
I enjoyed your films, the early ones.

33:42.932 --> 33:47.102
I took this meeting out of respect,
because I wanted to say no to your face.

33:48.302 --> 33:50.182
Thank you. Very respectful.

33:50.242 --> 33:51.812
You’re finished, Lester.

33:52.162 --> 33:54.782
Get your cataracts fixed,
read the trades.

33:55.362 --> 33:57.902
MGM just capitalized for six new films.

33:58.042 --> 34:00.042
They’re screaming for Sci-Fi.

34:00.732 --> 34:03.382
They’re offering me four times
what you guys are offering me.

34:05.442 --> 34:07.872
Well… what can I say?

34:08.732 --> 34:10.132
Congratulations.

34:11.183 --> 34:12.503
But see,

34:12.842 --> 34:15.672
it kind of worries me what you
said, let me tell you why.

34:16.503 --> 34:20.362
Couple of weeks ago I was sitting
at Trader Vic’s, I was enjoying a Mai Tai,

34:20.473 --> 34:22.183
when my pal, Warren Beatty comes in,

34:22.303 --> 34:24.533
he wishes me well,
we have a little chat.

34:24.983 --> 34:27.783
Seems he was attached
to star in ‘Zulu Empire’,

34:27.963 --> 34:30.163
which was just gonna anchor
that MGM slate.

34:30.503 --> 34:33.533
But Warren confided in me that
the picture’s gone over budget

34:33.572 --> 34:36.612
because the Zulu extras
want to unionize.

34:36.763 --> 34:40.813
They may be cannibals, but they want
health and dental so the movie’s kaput!

34:40.984 --> 34:44.364
Which means that the MGM
deal ain’t gonna happen,

34:44.386 --> 34:47.563
and your script ain’t worth
a buffalo shit on a nickel!

34:47.964 --> 34:51.643
So, the way it looks to me through
the cataracts I grant you,

34:51.734 --> 34:53.643
is that you can either sign here,

34:53.674 --> 34:56.764
and take 10,000 dollars
for your toilet-paper script,

34:56.873 --> 34:58.764
or you can go fuck yourself!

35:00.044 --> 35:01.534
With all due respect.

35:08.364 --> 35:09.704
You really know Warren Beatty?

35:09.964 --> 35:10.902
Yes I do.

35:10.903 --> 35:13.305
I took a leak next to him
once at the Golder Globes.

35:14.505 --> 35:15.305
Taco?

35:34.045 --> 35:35.415
Got any kids, Lester?

35:36.615 --> 35:38.475
Yeah, I have two daughters.

35:39.985 --> 35:41.045
See ‘em much?

35:41.765 --> 35:43.616
I talk to ‘em once a year…

35:44.306 --> 35:45.129
maybe.

35:45.166 --> 35:46.016
Why is that?

35:49.846 --> 35:51.506
I was a terrible father.

35:53.736 --> 35:55.246
The bullshit business…

35:56.046 --> 35:58.678
it’s like coal mining, you—you
come home to your wife and kids,

35:58.686 --> 36:00.736
you can’t… you can’t wash it off.

36:02.566 --> 36:03.276
You?

36:04.998 --> 36:06.118
Yeah I got a son.

36:07.736 --> 36:09.586
He lives in Virgina with his mother.

36:13.676 --> 36:14.737
You’re divorced?

36:15.767 --> 36:16.987
Taking time off.

36:19.567 --> 36:20.847
He needs to be, you know…

36:21.937 --> 36:22.987
where he is.

36:25.337 --> 36:26.817
Kids need the mother.

36:35.967 --> 36:40.277
They caught the Shah’s chief of security
trying to get on a plane to Paris.

36:41.737 --> 36:42.507
Listen,

36:42.707 --> 36:46.568
“since the incident, the number
of guards at the airport has doubled,

36:46.678 --> 36:50.077
a thorough background examination
should be expected‟.

36:50.078 --> 36:51.679
The movie cover isn’t strong enough yet,

36:51.680 --> 36:53.188
I need another week, Jack.

36:53.388 --> 36:54.418
You don’t have it.

36:57.588 --> 36:58.878
We got an office,

36:59.138 --> 37:00.568
we got business cards,

37:01.538 --> 37:02.968
we got a poster.

37:04.278 --> 37:07.278
If I’m the Revolutionary Guard, there’s
nothing we couldn’t have made at home.

37:07.738 --> 37:09.878
Six people’s lives depend on this.

37:11.418 --> 37:12.218
It’s not enough.

37:12.368 --> 37:15.248
If we’re gonna fool these people,
it has to be big,

37:15.388 --> 37:17.909
and it has to have something
that says it’s authentic.

37:19.369 --> 37:21.969
I did a movie with Rock Hudson one time.

37:23.389 --> 37:25.679
If you want to sell a lie…

37:26.819 --> 37:29.309
get the press to sell it for you.

37:30.219 --> 37:33.879
No no no, press event, then they’re—
they’re gonna read through the script.

37:34.169 --> 37:38.019
I got a bunch of actors who are gonna read
from beginning to end, all the way through.

37:38.189 --> 37:40.169
They have costumes and everything.

37:40.339 --> 37:44.109
No, no, no, I can’t, I got, uh,
Variety has the exclusive on that.

37:44.189 --> 37:47.450
Any way to make this more uh…
Middle Eastern?

37:47.970 --> 37:49.790
Mesopotamia?
Egypt?

37:50.170 --> 37:50.990
Iran.

37:51.020 --> 37:54.710
Look, I can get you in, but you
gotta promise me at least half a page.

37:54.880 --> 37:58.110
No, no, this thing’s an event,
it’s going to be a spectacle.

38:59.912 --> 39:00.682
Lester.

39:00.792 --> 39:03.772
Nina, you look fabulous!

39:03.912 --> 39:04.992
You doing the reading?

39:05.082 --> 39:07.311
I’m playing Serksi, the Galactic Witch.

39:07.312 --> 39:08.742
Great, I’ll call ya.

39:10.852 --> 39:13.512
Keep that fucking space
witch away from me.

39:13.742 --> 39:14.592
You know her?

39:14.912 --> 39:16.022
I was married to her.

39:16.142 --> 39:18.022
Oh my God, Iraq is amazing!

39:18.082 --> 39:19.082
Well, we’re shooting in Iran.

39:19.192 --> 39:20.713
Iran with an N?

39:20.853 --> 39:22.373
Yeah.
We’re very excited.

39:22.453 --> 39:23.853
You ever watch the news?

39:23.943 --> 39:25.853
What does the title refer to?

39:26.453 --> 39:27.853
The Argo!

39:27.993 --> 39:28.853
The thing…

39:29.253 --> 39:31.023
Like Jason and the
Golden Fleece, or what?

39:31.024 --> 39:33.855
No, no, it’s the ship, it’s the—
the spaceship, it goes…

39:33.958 --> 39:36.623
it goes everywhere, it goes all…

39:37.023 --> 39:38.623
…all throughout space.

39:38.773 --> 39:39.973
So it’s the Argonaut?

39:40.713 --> 39:41.343
No.

39:41.543 --> 39:42.823
What—what does Argo mean?

39:42.913 --> 39:43.913
I don’t know.

39:43.993 --> 39:44.973
You don’t know?

39:45.193 --> 39:47.683
It means “Argo, fuck yourself‟!

39:49.108 --> 39:51.824
Will you pay me every attention,
ladies and gentlemen?

39:52.060 --> 39:56.369
If our artists could settle in,
we’ll just be ready to begin the reading.

39:57.467 --> 40:01.044
Argo. From Mary Ann Boyd.

40:01.615 --> 40:04.717
Begin on starship…

40:15.735 --> 40:18.924
<i>The people working here are not diplomats.</i>

40:19.014 --> 40:21.751
<i>In fact, as the Iman Khomeini said,</i>

40:21.845 --> 40:25.799
<i>they have found no evidence that proves
that these people are diplomats.</i>

40:25.828 --> 40:30.330
<i>All evidence proves that
these people are spies.</i>

40:30.675 --> 40:34.130
<i>In the name of God,
the beneficent, the merciful,</i>

40:34.184 --> 40:36.940
<i>our message to the waking
peoples of the world,</i>

40:37.201 --> 40:40.040
<i>at this time we want to expose
the hateful acts of United States…</i>

40:40.064 --> 40:41.884
Our world has changed,

40:42.855 --> 40:46.031
Fires of hope stopped burning
in this galaxy long ago.

40:46.080 --> 40:47.813
The ship is turning around.

40:47.850 --> 40:49.583
Fire the thrusters!

40:49.755 --> 40:52.681
He says a gravitational field
that strong will kill any…

40:52.721 --> 40:56.943
<i>.. completely unjustified.
They and all others must know</i>

40:56.944 --> 41:00.098
<i>that the United States
of America will not yield</i>

41:00.099 --> 41:03.192
<i>to International Terrorism
or to blackmail.</i>

41:03.279 --> 41:05.268
Sir, we’ll be crashed.

41:05.316 --> 41:07.606
<i>There’s no enough time to…
— .. are controlled by capitalists,</i>

41:07.607 --> 41:09.222
<i>and large oil companies.</i>

41:09.477 --> 41:13.720
<i>The United States government considers
revolutionists as terrorists,</i>

41:13.846 --> 41:19.978
<i>but itself and its CIA are the most
terrorizing organization of all time.</i>

41:24.900 --> 41:27.968
We’ll find her ship,
we will find our chance.

41:28.663 --> 41:30.598
For the Argo lies my hope,

41:30.863 --> 41:32.874
my hero, my husband.

41:32.924 --> 41:36.162
<i>.. We will begin the trials and
carry out the sentences.</i>

41:36.163 --> 41:39.911
<i>.. We wonder where and how this apparently
endless parade of hatred will end.</i>

41:39.919 --> 41:40.803
EMBASSY BASEMENT JANUARY 23, 1980

41:40.804 --> 41:42.067
EMBASSY BASEMENT JANUARY 23, 1980
What do they want?

41:42.075 --> 41:44.804
<i>They say the question should
be not ‘what’, but ‘who’.</i>

41:44.814 --> 41:48.037
<i>The answer to this question is clear,
they want the former Shah,</i>

41:48.081 --> 41:51.379
<i>.. They should be ashamed
to talk about human rights.</i>

41:51.439 --> 41:53.689
<i>Carter and his government
have given asylum</i>

41:53.697 --> 41:55.237
<i>to the worst criminal.
— .. in this compound,</i>

41:55.242 --> 41:56.533
<i>for what, for life?</i>

41:56.752 --> 42:00.473
<i>They will remain until
the Shah is returned.</i>

42:00.641 --> 42:03.855
<i>But if the exiled Shah,
now in the New York City hospital,</i>

42:04.109 --> 42:07.294
<i>leaves the United States
for any place other than Iran,</i>

42:07.344 --> 42:11.005
<i>harsher decisions will be taken
against the hostages.</i>

42:16.766 --> 42:18.525
.. We go outside of the ship now,

42:18.573 --> 42:20.717
holding on a single red flower

42:20.766 --> 42:24.635
as it goes to the ruins
of the starship in the desert,

42:24.670 --> 42:28.523
fade to Back. The end.

42:33.730 --> 42:36.166
Here it is. What did I tell you!

42:36.421 --> 42:39.259
First shot of the picture.

42:42.840 --> 42:44.011
“Argo, fuck yourself.‟

42:44.276 --> 42:46.070
Argo, fuck yourself.

43:09.108 --> 43:14.559
OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE
JANUARY 25, 1980

43:23.682 --> 43:24.806
Brace yourself.

43:24.840 --> 43:27.944
It’s like talking to those two
old fucks from The Muppets.

43:31.760 --> 43:33.474
Aliens and robots?

43:34.625 --> 43:35.442
Yes, sir.

43:36.451 --> 43:39.537
You’re telling me that there is a movie
company in Hollywood right now,

43:39.917 --> 43:41.862
that is funded by the CIA?

43:42.360 --> 43:43.913
— Yes, sir.

43:44.925 --> 43:46.749
What’s wrong with the bikes again?

43:46.750 --> 43:48.478
We tried to get the message upstairs, sir.

43:48.510 --> 43:51.493
You think… you think this is
more plausible than teachers?

43:51.519 --> 43:54.927
Yes, we do. One, there are no more
foreign teachers in Iran…

43:54.951 --> 43:57.075
And we think everybody
knows Hollywood people,

43:57.083 --> 43:59.090
and everybody knows they
ain’t shootin’ Stalingrad,

43:59.091 --> 44:01.075
with Bob Hope directing
if it would sell tickets.

44:02.145 --> 44:04.102
There are only bad options,

44:04.616 --> 44:06.705
it’s about finding the best one.

44:06.979 --> 44:09.067
You don’t have a better
bad idea than this?

44:09.203 --> 44:11.973
This is the best bad idea we have, sir.

44:12.466 --> 44:13.586
By far.

44:21.546 --> 44:25.665
The United States Government has just
sanctioned your Science Fiction movie.

44:26.530 --> 44:28.461
Thank you, sir.

45:04.160 --> 45:09.851
I’m required to remind you that if you are
detained, the agency will not claim you.

45:10.772 --> 45:12.930
Barely claim me as it is.

45:14.065 --> 45:16.282
Is there any in case of obstacle?

45:16.380 --> 45:19.172
Just Christine.

45:21.311 --> 45:23.519
I should have brought some
books to read in prison.

45:23.668 --> 45:24.602
No.

45:25.010 --> 45:27.331
They’ll kill you long before prison.

45:29.042 --> 45:30.929
— Thanks for the ride.
— Yeah.

45:40.642 --> 45:43.247
— Studio 6.
— We got a green light.

45:43.275 --> 45:45.550
Keep the office running
until you hear otherwise.

45:45.647 --> 45:48.673
— Argo fuck yourself.
— Argo fuck yourself.

46:06.537 --> 46:08.176
<i>Your attention please,</i>

46:08.278 --> 46:12.227
<i>this is the final calling for
British Airways flight 87.</i>

46:44.966 --> 46:47.834
We are a nation of 35 millions,

46:47.945 --> 46:52.566
and many of these people
are looking for to murder them.

46:54.860 --> 46:55.762
Hey.

46:56.029 --> 46:56.802
Hey.

46:58.343 --> 46:59.651
Come to bed.

47:00.576 --> 47:02.360
Another 5 minutes.

47:13.400 --> 47:15.797
She pleaded with me.

47:16.533 --> 47:19.496
When it started in the streets
nine months ago, she…

47:20.904 --> 47:23.513
she begged for us to leave.

47:24.396 --> 47:26.832
She packed our bags.

47:26.920 --> 47:30.518
I said, “just—just a little bit longer‟.

47:33.109 --> 47:36.324
And all I was thinking was…

47:37.240 --> 47:39.302
“stay…

47:39.669 --> 47:41.493
this is good for me.

47:42.803 --> 47:44.094
Stay.

47:47.409 --> 47:49.867
Show Newsom you got the balls‟.

47:54.860 --> 47:58.056
I can’t believe I put Kathy
in this position.

48:06.255 --> 48:08.603
I think we’re gonna die here.

48:35.460 --> 48:39.782
ISTANBUL, TURKEY
JANUARY 27, 1980

48:58.036 --> 49:02.328
“Iran is a hundred percent not
in a pre-revolutionary state‟.

49:02.406 --> 49:05.602
CIA brief, November, 1st, 1979.

49:05.794 --> 49:08.131
Can’t be right all the time.

49:08.472 --> 49:09.809
Kevin?

49:09.826 --> 49:11.461
When did you get back?

49:12.433 --> 49:15.743
The Shah escaped on the 747
so laden with gold bars,

49:15.761 --> 49:18.098
that they didn’t make it off the runway.

49:18.416 --> 49:19.751
But you kept busy.

49:19.853 --> 49:24.132
Fairing out the torture apparatus
of our friends fallen dictation.

49:24.941 --> 49:26.577
It’s getting worse.

49:26.609 --> 49:30.164
Anyone that lands at Mehrabad
now fills in one of these.

49:30.872 --> 49:32.798
This strip makes a copy
to the one underneath,

49:32.849 --> 49:35.267
passenger keeps yellow,
airport keeps white,

49:35.275 --> 49:36.824
when you leave the country,
they match them up

49:36.825 --> 49:39.117
to verify you came into the country
when you say you did.

49:39.153 --> 49:40.515
So if they look,

49:40.724 --> 49:43.263
they’ll see I didn’t come into
the country with six people.

49:43.739 --> 49:45.538
If they look.

49:47.779 --> 49:50.738
When you land, you should go straight
to the Ministry of Culture and…

49:51.057 --> 49:53.982
Islamic Guidance, kiss the ring.

49:54.436 --> 49:57.673
Get on record as having
applied for film permit.

49:57.816 --> 50:01.590
If they catch you later, at least they’ll
be confused while they’re torturing you.

50:04.461 --> 50:08.319
IRANIAN CONSULATE — TURKEY

50:19.466 --> 50:21.887
What will be the purpose
of your visit to Iran?

50:21.942 --> 50:25.444
Uh… film production. Business.

50:27.432 --> 50:30.371
Why didn’t you get your visa in Canada?

50:31.584 --> 50:35.296
Well, I would have loved to, except my
boss didn’t send a telex until I got here.

50:35.977 --> 50:39.676
If the guy had an intelligent thought
in his head, it would die of loneliness.

51:00.422 --> 51:02.510
The Times and AP found out six escaped.

51:03.459 --> 51:06.480
They know who they are, and they know
they’re hiding out with the Canadians.

51:06.997 --> 51:08.677
Somebody withdrew on the family’s talk.

51:08.703 --> 51:09.883
Mother of God.

51:10.028 --> 51:12.884
Yeah I just put Vance on a plane to
take the head of eds to a circus,

51:12.906 --> 51:15.491
he thinks he can get him
to sit on it for now.

51:16.924 --> 51:18.998
You guy’d better get them.

51:19.356 --> 51:21.190
And get the hell out.

51:21.532 --> 51:24.945
The Captain has informed us
that we’re entering Iranian airspace.

51:25.082 --> 51:28.812
We’ll be coming through to collect
any remaining alcoholic beverages.

54:07.944 --> 54:10.244
This film crew is just yourself?

54:10.352 --> 54:13.029
No, we have six more from
Canada meeting us today.

54:13.165 --> 54:15.263
You’d like to film at the bazaar?

54:15.582 --> 54:18.043
The bazaar, maybe the palace.

54:18.291 --> 54:19.961
Landmark sites.

54:20.239 --> 54:21.574
I see.

54:22.604 --> 54:24.525
The exotic orients.

54:24.913 --> 54:27.728
Snake charmers, flying carpets.

54:29.097 --> 54:31.698
You came to us at a complicated time.

54:32.255 --> 54:35.276
Before the revolution forty percent
of the movie theaters in Tehran

54:35.281 --> 54:37.058
were showing pornograph.

54:37.491 --> 54:38.745
I understand.

54:38.856 --> 54:41.867
The function of this
office is purification,

54:42.185 --> 54:45.245
as well as promotion for the arts.

54:46.714 --> 54:49.386
I’ll review this for the Ministry.

54:50.688 --> 54:52.149
Thank you.

54:52.172 --> 54:54.227
— Salam.
— Salam.

55:00.134 --> 55:02.814
Lester, you’re working late.

55:02.946 --> 55:04.791
Until the dawns early light.

55:05.111 --> 55:09.070
You got stamina, Lester. I wanna be you.

55:09.126 --> 55:13.041
Well, I’m a hundred and fifty years
old, so you wouldn’t be me for long.

55:21.875 --> 55:24.221
— Ambassador.
— Ken Taylor.

55:24.315 --> 55:26.177
Thank you for what you’re doing.

55:26.513 --> 55:29.813
I was expecting more of a G-Man look.

55:30.319 --> 55:32.837
I think you’re thinking of the FBI, sir.

55:33.130 --> 55:34.818
Ah. This way.

55:47.676 --> 55:49.931
These are blank—you know, stamps…

55:50.108 --> 55:52.193
Yeah, I’ll take care of this.

55:53.366 --> 55:54.883
How long?

55:55.245 --> 55:57.743
A day to prep their covers…
two if they need it.

55:57.791 --> 55:59.448
And—and you’ll fly out with them?

55:59.523 --> 56:00.897
Yeah.

56:01.412 --> 56:03.004
There’s something you should know.

56:03.317 --> 56:06.410
We think our housekeeper’s
figured out who they are.

56:07.070 --> 56:11.464
We don’t know if we can trust her.
So, sooner is better.

57:01.361 --> 57:02.796
Hi.

57:02.885 --> 57:04.835
Hi. My name’s Kevin Harkins…

57:05.865 --> 57:07.510
and I’m gonna get you home.

57:08.851 --> 57:11.754
These are the screenplays
for your cover identities.

57:13.286 --> 57:15.562
It’s—it’s theater of the absurd.

57:15.600 --> 57:17.038
What are our chances?

57:17.146 --> 57:18.521
Chances are good.

57:18.616 --> 57:21.763
Good? Well, what’s the uh…
what’s the number value of good?

57:21.813 --> 57:24.829
A thirty percent chance of
being publicly executed?

57:24.939 --> 57:28.087
Can you—can you tell me what the
objection was to normal cover identities?

57:28.155 --> 57:30.302
There are no Canadians in
the country for no reason.

57:30.383 --> 57:31.684
They’ll sniff us out regardless.

57:31.718 --> 57:34.717
The Swedish Consul, they—they accused him
of being an American at the airport,

57:34.718 --> 57:35.906
they held him for an hour.

57:35.912 --> 57:38.961
We can’t hold upon that, we don’t know
what the hell movie people do.

57:38.962 --> 57:41.039
That’s why I’m here.

57:41.081 --> 57:43.969
I’m gonna help you, I’m gonna be
with you the whole way. This is what I do.

57:44.924 --> 57:47.262
Have you gotten people
out this way before?

57:47.867 --> 57:50.051
This would be a first.

57:51.081 --> 57:54.146
Do you know that everyday they catch
another friend of the Shah at the airport?

57:54.172 --> 57:56.097
— Joe…
— Kangaroo trials, and—

57:56.106 --> 57:59.487
And then firing squads just for having
American names in their phone books.

57:59.942 --> 58:01.385
You’ve been here and hour,

58:01.642 --> 58:04.615
and—and you’re asking us to trust
you with our lives, Mr…

58:04.697 --> 58:06.098
Harkins.

58:06.353 --> 58:08.380
That’s your real name?

58:08.484 --> 58:09.759
No.

58:12.548 --> 58:16.386
I know there are risks involved.
Serious risks.

58:16.905 --> 58:19.882
But it is time to go.

58:20.944 --> 58:23.473
We’ve got orders to close
the embassy and go back.

58:23.593 --> 58:25.799
There’s nowhere for them to stay.

58:26.506 --> 58:29.480
We will never make it through
immigration at the airport.

58:29.615 --> 58:31.130
I’m serious.

58:31.186 --> 58:34.867
I mean no, this is what? The part we say,
this is so crazy it might actually work?

58:34.875 --> 58:36.870
— Come on!
— I saw in Burma, they get people out.

58:36.878 --> 58:40.005
Snitches and Banana Republic, they get
them over the border after the coup,

58:40.013 --> 58:42.280
pay the guards at the crossing a
hundred bucks to look the other way.

58:42.296 --> 58:44.415
You know, his opinion got us out
in the first place.

58:44.504 --> 58:48.398
If we go out there with fake passports,
we are spies, period, that’s execution.

58:48.414 --> 58:49.734
You got a problem lying, Joe?

58:49.745 --> 58:51.694
But the point is, we can’t stay here!

58:51.982 --> 58:55.360
If we get caught, you and Pat go on trial
for harboring the enemy, you know that.

58:55.523 --> 58:58.468
Pat and I have discussed this,
it’s the risk we took.

58:59.238 --> 59:02.243
That man out there has got bad
cards and he is going to lose,

59:02.253 --> 59:05.234
and if he loses… it’s our lives.

59:06.620 --> 59:09.598
And his life too.

59:09.801 --> 59:12.483
Look, we don’t have any alternatives.

59:12.608 --> 59:14.879
We gotta go.

59:19.943 --> 59:23.489
These cover identities were created
specifically for each one of you.

59:23.764 --> 59:26.297
What you need to do is memorize
everything that’s inside.

59:26.423 --> 59:30.495
Who you are, what you are, where you’ve
been, complete bio. And then add to that:

59:30.788 --> 59:34.019
where do you vacation, what are you
allergies, who’d you have an affair with.

59:34.282 --> 59:35.534
The only way this works,

59:35.660 --> 59:39.090
is if you believe that you’re these people
so much that you’re dream like them.

59:40.358 --> 59:42.509
Get started tonight.

59:42.546 --> 59:45.525
I’ll be back tomorrow. We’ll get going.
Good luck.

59:51.230 --> 59:53.165
Wow, my guy kind of sucks.

59:53.262 --> 59:54.777
What’s your name?

59:55.172 --> 59:57.860
Mike McEwan A.

59:58.286 --> 59:59.606
Sounds convincing.

59:59.634 --> 01:00:01.725
Kathy, what’s your name?

01:00:29.412 --> 01:00:32.397
The Loveboat will be seeing
fifteen minutes from now.

01:00:33.848 --> 01:00:36.335
.. insisted that the crisis in Afghanistan

01:00:36.346 --> 01:00:40.180
will not divert the attention of the United
States from the plight of the hostages.

01:00:40.214 --> 01:00:43.442
.. he seems to be if not impotent,
but at least reluctant…

01:00:43.632 --> 01:00:47.066
The United States finds itself
in such bitter confrontation

01:00:47.074 --> 01:00:51.198
with the Soviet Union over that
country’s invasion of Afghanistan…

01:00:51.505 --> 01:00:53.929
The United States is now
moving towards the decision

01:00:53.930 --> 01:00:56.431
to boycott the summer
Olympics in Moscow.

01:00:57.385 --> 01:01:01.156
Bad new, bad news. Even when
it’s good news, it’s bad news.

01:01:01.222 --> 01:01:04.873
John Wayne’s in the ground six months,
this is what’s left of America.

01:01:33.245 --> 01:01:35.514
The Minister of Culture and Guidance

01:01:35.515 --> 01:01:37.046
has approved your location scout.

01:01:37.081 --> 01:01:38.575
He will send his representative

01:01:38.576 --> 01:01:42.117
to meet you and your crew at the
Grand Bazaar tomorrow at 3 P.M.

01:01:43.044 --> 01:01:44.880
They called your bluff.

01:01:45.226 --> 01:01:47.704
— Maybe they’re cooperating.
— Absolutely not.

01:01:47.870 --> 01:01:52.543
Seven Americans walking the bazaar
is asking for a riot, it’s the hive.

01:01:52.813 --> 01:01:54.171
Seven Canadians, Jack.

01:01:54.213 --> 01:01:57.557
Never give them opening shots at a cover.

01:01:58.196 --> 01:02:00.854
— Are they even ready?
— They’re getting there.

01:02:01.091 --> 01:02:03.073
There’s no prize for most improvements.

01:02:03.098 --> 01:02:03.995
I don’t have a choice.

01:02:04.003 --> 01:02:07.097
We say no, they show up at their residence
and drag everyone out at gun point.

01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:08.962
How well do you think their
covers are gonna hold up

01:02:08.963 --> 01:02:10.933
when they’re getting their
fingernails pulled out?

01:02:30.699 --> 01:02:34.904
You want us to go the Grand Bazaar
at three o’clock in the afternoon?

01:02:35.461 --> 01:02:38.181
You said a day learning our cover
then straight to the airport.

01:02:38.292 --> 01:02:39.585
— Do they suspect something?

01:02:40.008 --> 01:02:43.269
What I know is we need to
pretend to be a movie crew.

01:02:43.361 --> 01:02:47.411
We go to the bazaar today, we
fly from the airport tomorrow.

01:02:48.830 --> 01:02:50.651
We won’t do it.

01:02:52.095 --> 01:02:55.108
He told them that there are six of
us, so then they’re expecting six,

01:02:55.126 --> 01:02:56.688
it would be suspicious not
to show up at this point.

01:02:56.717 --> 01:02:58.629
Goddammit, guys! What else
do we have to do?!

01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:00.457
Alright? What el—what—
what’s the alternative?!

01:03:00.465 --> 01:03:02.207
We don’t have to show them
the only cards we’re holding,

01:03:02.208 --> 01:03:03.505
which is that they
don’t know we’re here!

01:03:03.513 --> 01:03:05.947
I get it! That’s the ball game,
okay, we—you know,

01:03:05.994 --> 01:03:08.565
Look, we don’t have any other…
other choice! What are we gonna do?!

01:03:08.570 --> 01:03:11.201
Who says that we’ll know
our covers well enough?

01:03:11.221 --> 01:03:12.764
We’re no in the CIA!

01:03:13.883 --> 01:03:15.246
It’s suicide.

01:03:15.574 --> 01:03:17.793
I’m asking you to trust me.

01:03:18.985 --> 01:03:21.524
I don’t trust you.

01:03:22.812 --> 01:03:24.268
This is the game, Joe.

01:03:24.369 --> 01:03:25.506
What world are you living in?

01:03:25.602 --> 01:03:26.581
What world am I…?

01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:29.423
The one where they’re hanging people
from construction cranes, Bob!

01:03:29.424 --> 01:03:30.773
It’s too dangerous,

01:03:30.812 --> 01:03:33.372
— I don’t want to bring my wife into this.
— Joe, can you stop?

01:03:34.452 --> 01:03:35.992
Joe?

01:03:42.275 --> 01:03:44.193
So, we’ll see you at two.

01:04:07.281 --> 01:04:12.617
So, don’t be recognizable, but look
exactly like your passport photo.

01:04:13.557 --> 01:04:16.192
I haven’t been this nervous
since our wedding.

01:04:17.764 --> 01:04:20.645
Only this isn’t a huge mistake, hopefully.

01:04:21.039 --> 01:04:23.647
Like this… Okay.

01:04:25.901 --> 01:04:27.449
Hello?

01:04:30.064 --> 01:04:31.608
Hello?

01:04:32.261 --> 01:04:34.009
Hello?

01:04:40.170 --> 01:04:41.781
Who was that?

01:04:44.866 --> 01:04:46.801
— Mark?
— Yeah?

01:04:48.667 --> 01:04:50.277
I’m scared.

01:04:52.695 --> 01:04:54.732
It’s okay.

01:05:41.492 --> 01:05:42.837
Where are they?

01:05:43.083 --> 01:05:44.964
In the kitchen.

01:06:01.359 --> 01:06:03.338
This is what I do…

01:06:03.365 --> 01:06:05.053
I get people out…

01:06:06.451 --> 01:06:08.720
and I’ve never left anyone behind.

01:06:10.929 --> 01:06:13.681
I wish I could believe you, Mr. Harkins.

01:06:18.414 --> 01:06:20.476
My name is Tony Mendez.

01:06:20.977 --> 01:06:24.673
I’m from New York, my worked construction,
my mother teaches elementary school,

01:06:24.701 --> 01:06:27.312
I have a wife and a ten year old son.

01:06:29.730 --> 01:06:33.744
You play along with me today, I promise
you I will get you out tomorrow.

01:06:38.866 --> 01:06:40.271
Fuck.

01:07:49.891 --> 01:07:51.286
Hang on.

01:08:39.728 --> 01:08:41.548
You alright?

01:08:46.218 --> 01:08:48.653
Okay, tell me who you are?

01:08:49.272 --> 01:08:51.437
Mike McEwan, cameraman.

01:08:51.767 --> 01:08:54.259
Robert Baker, director.

01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:57.095
Timothy Harris, location manager.

01:08:57.189 --> 01:08:59.294
Mary Ann Boyd, screenwriter.

01:08:59.350 --> 01:09:01.260
Rachel Dewart, production designer.

01:09:01.308 --> 01:09:03.169
Sean Bissett, associate producer.

01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:05.979
Alright, let’s go make the movie.

01:09:18.572 --> 01:09:20.740
Welcome, welcome,
my name is Reza Borhani.

01:09:20.765 --> 01:09:22.122
Kevin Harkins, I’m the producer.

01:09:22.194 --> 01:09:25.057
— Nice to meet you.
— This is Mike McEwan, our cameraman,

01:09:25.072 --> 01:09:27.510
this is Tim, this is Mary,
our screenwriter,

01:09:27.518 --> 01:09:29.113
and this is our director, Bob Baker.

01:09:29.115 --> 01:09:30.603
— You are the director?
— Yes.

01:09:31.249 --> 01:09:33.617
Is this film a foreign brides film?

01:09:34.493 --> 01:09:35.926
I’m sorry?

01:09:35.997 --> 01:09:39.526
A film where a foreign bride
comes to Iran, but uh…

01:09:39.604 --> 01:09:42.849
she doesn’t understand the
language or the customs,

01:09:42.890 --> 01:09:45.301
and there is misunderstandings and laughs?

01:09:45.357 --> 01:09:46.997
Oh, no.

01:09:51.758 --> 01:09:56.350
The bazaar in Tehran is one
of the largest in the world.

01:09:56.445 --> 01:09:58.109
[Farsi] Izar, salam, choukran.

01:09:58.154 --> 01:10:02.429
This Bazaar has been on this spot
for over 8000 years.

01:10:02.469 --> 01:10:07.971
You can find many items such as
paper, spices, precious metals

01:10:08.093 --> 01:10:10.965
All, right here.
Uh, right this way.

01:10:10.998 --> 01:10:12.799
[Farsi]

01:10:15.878 --> 01:10:17.355
This way.

01:10:32.341 --> 01:10:33.886
— Uh, Mike?
— Yeah.

01:10:34.114 --> 01:10:35.680
If I was to say that you’re looking
through the wrong end

01:10:35.688 --> 01:10:37.931
of that view finder, would I be right?

01:10:40.411 --> 01:10:41.827
Yeah.

01:10:49.304 --> 01:10:51.021
Just a little bit now.

01:11:01.145 --> 01:11:02.810
[Farsi]

01:11:02.993 --> 01:11:05.008
[Farsi]

01:11:20.022 --> 01:11:23.083
Please wait here, let’s uh, stay together.

01:11:40.273 --> 01:11:42.065
He wants to know the
photograph you took…

01:11:42.118 --> 01:11:45.003
It’s okay, it’s her job to take
photographs. Production design.

01:11:45.409 --> 01:11:48.552
He says, he did not give you permission
to take photograph of his store.

01:11:48.657 --> 01:11:50.654
Well that’s okay, you can
tell him he can have it.

01:11:53.596 --> 01:11:55.887
Please, please take that photograph.

01:12:04.933 --> 01:12:07.352
— [Farsi] Peace be upon you.
— And upon you sir. Welcome.

01:12:07.374 --> 01:12:08.519
I hope you are well.

01:12:08.572 --> 01:12:10.574
Thank you very much. How are you?

01:12:10.656 --> 01:12:13.083
I’m very well. What’s your name?

01:12:13.227 --> 01:12:14.762
Sahar.

01:12:25.730 --> 01:12:29.032
He’s saying that the Shah killed
his son with an American gun.

01:12:39.289 --> 01:12:41.913
No! Canada! Cana—Canada!

01:12:42.001 --> 01:12:44.841
Ι’d lіkе tо ѕuggеѕt thаt
wе аrе еndіng thіѕ vіѕіt!

01:12:48.041 --> 01:12:49.656
Let’s go off this now!

01:12:53.615 --> 01:12:55.614
You know, sister, those who are with him,

01:12:55.664 --> 01:12:58.651
Rasool Allah, we are tender with them.

01:12:59.017 --> 01:13:01.012
But stern against the infidels.

01:13:01.104 --> 01:13:03.234
With God’s will.

01:13:04.065 --> 01:13:07.672
But those who sit silently have sinned.

01:13:07.742 --> 01:13:10.377
Yes. Any way I may help, sir?

01:13:11.303 --> 01:13:14.137
No, only one thing.

01:13:15.118 --> 01:13:17.678
How long have they been there?

01:13:17.947 --> 01:13:19.592
Sorry?

01:13:20.517 --> 01:13:21.894
The guest of the Ambassador…

01:13:21.964 --> 01:13:23.708
how long have they been here?

01:13:26.327 --> 01:13:28.167
They arrived two days ago.

01:13:28.309 --> 01:13:33.865
Forgive my intrusion,
we must stay vigilant.

01:13:34.905 --> 01:13:37.673
Everyone in this house
is a friend of Iran.

01:14:12.479 --> 01:14:13.892
How did it go?

01:14:15.429 --> 01:14:17.997
What about tomorrow?

01:14:18.253 --> 01:14:20.737
Tomorrow they’ll be ready.

01:14:41.687 --> 01:14:46.407
A man in Scranton is placing a flag
in his lawn for every day of captivity.

01:14:46.644 --> 01:14:50.263
He runs out of lawn,
Kennedy wins the primary.

01:14:50.353 --> 01:14:53.153
The six with the Canadians are coming out.

01:15:03.986 --> 01:15:05.603
Who signed off on this?

01:15:05.691 --> 01:15:07.625
You! Where was your passport issued?

01:15:07.716 --> 01:15:09.174
— Vancouver.
— Where were you born?

01:15:09.225 --> 01:15:10.591
— Toronto
— “Torono‟.

01:15:10.615 --> 01:15:11.912
Canadians don’t pronounce the T.

01:15:11.956 --> 01:15:14.532
Some Komiteh guard is
actually gonna know that?

01:15:14.668 --> 01:15:18.246
If you’re detained for questioning they
will bring out someone who knows that, yes.

01:15:18.599 --> 01:15:22.159
Mary, who were the last three
Prime Ministers to Canada?

01:15:22.380 --> 01:15:24.801
Uh… Trudeau, Pearson and Diefenbaker.

01:15:24.864 --> 01:15:26.896
— What’s your father’s name?
— Howard.

01:15:26.981 --> 01:15:28.635
— What’s his occupation?
— Fisherman.

01:15:28.722 --> 01:15:31.125
— Where were you born?
— Halifax, Nova Scotia.

01:15:31.155 --> 01:15:32.637
What’s your date of birth?

01:15:32.910 --> 01:15:35.351
February 21st, 1952.

01:15:35.430 --> 01:15:37.086
Good. What’s your job on the movie?
— Producer.

01:15:37.094 --> 01:15:39.277
Associate producer. What was
the last movie you produced?

01:15:39.475 --> 01:15:41.153
— “High and Dry‟.
— Who paid for that?

01:15:41.267 --> 01:15:42.701
— CFDC.
— What’s your middle name?

01:15:42.865 --> 01:15:44.844
What’s your middle name?
What’s your middle name?

01:15:44.863 --> 01:15:46.830
— Leon…
— Shoot him! He’s an American spy.

01:15:48.216 --> 01:15:50.515
Look, they’re gonna try
and break you. Okay?

01:15:50.556 --> 01:15:52.047
By trying to get you agitated.

01:15:52.096 --> 01:15:53.977
You have to know your
resume back to front.

01:15:54.007 --> 01:15:56.229
Do you really believe your little
story’s gonna make a difference

01:15:56.242 --> 01:15:58.620
when there’s a gun to our heads?

01:15:59.591 --> 01:16:03.120
I think my story is the only thing
between you and a gun to your head.

01:16:05.082 --> 01:16:06.505
That’s right.

01:16:12.276 --> 01:16:15.323
Hey. They made it through
the location scout.

01:16:27.375 --> 01:16:29.514
You have a call.

01:16:40.020 --> 01:16:43.266
— What is it?
— Go to black on green.

01:16:44.734 --> 01:16:46.129
Go.

01:16:46.180 --> 01:16:47.858
— It all just changed.
— What?

01:16:47.913 --> 01:16:49.720
They’re calling it again,
you gotta come back.

01:16:49.835 --> 01:16:51.243
— What?
— Flight Chiefs are planning

01:16:51.258 --> 01:16:53.409
a military rescue of the hostages,

01:16:53.432 --> 01:16:56.948
Delta Force started training
to storm the grounds. So,

01:16:56.991 --> 01:16:59.695
if the six of them are brought down there,

01:16:59.762 --> 01:17:01.820
they won’t be held for long.

01:17:02.813 --> 01:17:06.406
Goddammit! I never would have exposed them
if I wasn’t authorized to get them out!

01:17:06.446 --> 01:17:09.124
— It’s over, Tony.
— If they stay here, they will be taken.

01:17:09.222 --> 01:17:12.003
— Probably not alive.
— Listen to me!

01:17:12.196 --> 01:17:13.832
The thinking has changed.

01:17:14.001 --> 01:17:17.214
Six Americans get pulled out of
the Canadian diplomat’s house

01:17:17.226 --> 01:17:19.730
and executed, it’s a world outrage.

01:17:20.230 --> 01:17:23.494
Six Americans get caught
playing movie make–believe

01:17:23.503 --> 01:17:25.953
with the CIA at the airport and executed,

01:17:26.116 --> 01:17:30.910
it’s a national embarrassment.
They are calling the operation.

01:17:33.389 --> 01:17:35.954
We’re responsible for these people.

01:17:36.782 --> 01:17:40.364
What we are is required to follow orders.

01:17:40.580 --> 01:17:42.086
I’m sorry.

01:17:59.693 --> 01:18:01.239
Come in.

01:18:02.119 --> 01:18:05.078
We’re ready to try again.

01:18:05.981 --> 01:18:07.437
You’re ready.

01:18:07.603 --> 01:18:09.531
You worked hard.

01:18:09.991 --> 01:18:13.497
Probably the best thing to do
for you right now would be…

01:18:13.664 --> 01:18:15.484
just to relax.

01:18:16.009 --> 01:18:17.444
Okay.

01:18:17.718 --> 01:18:19.221
You did good.

01:18:19.975 --> 01:18:21.482
Thanks.

01:18:47.651 --> 01:18:50.570
So you know.

01:18:50.664 --> 01:18:54.846
Exfil wants you to burn the
passports before you leave.

01:18:56.512 --> 01:18:58.385
If you tell them now, they’ll panic.

01:18:58.404 --> 01:19:00.903
I think it’s best if you just don’t show.

01:19:03.041 --> 01:19:05.619
It was always a fucked mission.

01:19:06.093 --> 01:19:08.856
You came closer than anybody else.

01:21:37.476 --> 01:21:38.664
It’s off…

01:21:38.677 --> 01:21:40.797
they want us to pack up the office.

01:21:43.410 --> 01:21:46.615
This can wait. Let’s go get a drink.

01:22:10.672 --> 01:22:12.703
He’s late.

01:22:26.343 --> 01:22:27.294
O’Donnell.

01:22:27.341 --> 01:22:30.325
Somebody’s responsible
when things happen, Jack.

01:22:31.272 --> 01:22:32.675
I’m responsible.

01:22:33.053 --> 01:22:34.619
I’m taking them through.

01:22:34.870 --> 01:22:36.508
Tony?

01:22:45.568 --> 01:22:47.256
Alan! Alan,

01:22:47.282 --> 01:22:50.050
we need to confirm those seven
tickets out of Tehran on Swissair.

01:22:50.066 --> 01:22:51.270
Engell shut that down.

01:22:51.316 --> 01:22:52.760
I say it’s back on!

01:22:52.815 --> 01:22:55.024
— I can’t do it, it’s back stopped!
— Wait wait, wait a minute!

01:22:55.565 --> 01:22:57.112
What the hell are you talking
about, back stopped,

01:22:57.120 --> 01:22:58.493
what the hell does that mean?

01:22:58.537 --> 01:23:01.299
Carter’s gotta say yes
for us to get the tickets.

01:23:11.374 --> 01:23:12.774
Time to go.

01:23:23.182 --> 01:23:24.616
Alright.

01:23:25.582 --> 01:23:28.268
— Where’s Engell?
— Uh, he’s in a meeting.

01:23:28.390 --> 01:23:30.212
Pull him out.

01:23:31.536 --> 01:23:32.708
Pull him out!

01:23:35.096 --> 01:23:36.984
Thank you. See you soon.

01:23:36.994 --> 01:23:38.398
Sahar’s on the bus.

01:23:38.504 --> 01:23:40.574
— Great.
— Sahar will be fine.

01:23:40.622 --> 01:23:42.796
— Thank you.
— Thank you!

01:23:42.821 --> 01:23:44.197
You two leave right now.

01:23:44.229 --> 01:23:46.024
We’ll leave on the train in half an hour.

01:23:46.064 --> 01:23:47.484
Good.

01:23:50.980 --> 01:23:52.423
And he said no.

01:23:52.456 --> 01:23:54.550
This is not a long leisure
and it never has been,

01:23:54.574 --> 01:23:56.407
and you don’t decide if it goes!

01:23:56.826 --> 01:23:58.507
It is going!

01:23:58.706 --> 01:24:00.688
Jack. You are this close.

01:24:00.715 --> 01:24:02.473
Am I? Am I really that close?

01:24:02.520 --> 01:24:03.942
You are this Goddamn close to—

01:24:03.969 --> 01:24:08.273
I am not gonna leave him at the airport
with six people and his dick in his hand.

01:24:08.362 --> 01:24:10.406
You tell the director
to call the White House!

01:24:10.466 --> 01:24:12.228
Do your fucking job!

01:24:20.498 --> 01:24:23.356
— Get to your plane, Claude
— Oui monsieur.

01:24:28.858 --> 01:24:32.602
First time anyone’s gonna ask you
a question is at the first check point.

01:24:32.802 --> 01:24:35.603
The first check point is just to
get a look at your passports.

01:24:35.934 --> 01:24:38.750
Passports came straight from
Ottawa last week. They’re clean.

01:24:39.684 --> 01:24:41.814
You’re gonna find White
House Chief of Staff!

01:24:41.897 --> 01:24:43.160
How would I find him?

01:24:43.288 --> 01:24:46.355
We’re a fucking spy agency! Find him!

01:24:46.891 --> 01:24:50.105
The second check point is immigration.

01:24:50.460 --> 01:24:52.243
You’re each gonna hand them one of these.

01:24:52.328 --> 01:24:55.259
It says that you landed in
the country two days ago.

01:24:55.365 --> 01:24:58.297
They’ll look for the matching
white one, which doesn’t exist.

01:24:58.463 --> 01:25:00.808
You’ll say you don’t know what happened…

01:25:00.834 --> 01:25:03.240
and if you believe they
lost they white set,

01:25:03.507 --> 01:25:05.031
they’ll believe it too.

01:25:05.374 --> 01:25:08.929
Jordan’s in the West Wing,
he’s not taking calls.

01:25:10.301 --> 01:25:11.866
Where are his kids?

01:25:11.957 --> 01:25:13.100
What?

01:25:13.179 --> 01:25:15.657
Where do his kids go to school?

01:25:21.932 --> 01:25:23.334
Thank you, thank you.

01:25:23.416 --> 01:25:26.261
Pace Academy, Buckhead, Georgia.

01:25:29.178 --> 01:25:30.326
White House.

01:25:30.431 --> 01:25:34.581
Yes, this is Mr. Murphy from Pace
Academy calling for Mr. Jordan.

01:25:35.128 --> 01:25:37.518
Yeah, I’m afraid it is an emergency.

01:25:37.744 --> 01:25:40.396
Hold for the Chief of Staff’s Office.

01:25:40.547 --> 01:25:42.541
The third check point is the trap.

01:25:42.661 --> 01:25:44.585
It’s manned by the Revolutionary Guard,

01:25:44.648 --> 01:25:47.674
most of them were educated
in the U.S and Europe…

01:25:47.840 --> 01:25:50.814
and all of them are looking for Americans.

01:26:02.986 --> 01:26:04.677
— Hello?
— Jack O’Donnell from CI—

01:26:04.709 --> 01:26:05.748
Wait, wait! Who?

01:26:05.820 --> 01:26:07.877
Iran Guesthouse operation is ready now,

01:26:07.887 --> 01:26:09.575
if we don’t have the President’s go ahead,

01:26:09.585 --> 01:26:11.116
they are going to be captured.

01:26:12.003 --> 01:26:13.690
David, pick up!

01:26:30.811 --> 01:26:33.415
Zurich, it’s under Harkins.

01:26:41.420 --> 01:26:44.817
I’m sorry sir, I don’t see
you’d have these reservations.

01:26:47.612 --> 01:26:49.452
Telex for Flash!

01:26:50.290 --> 01:26:54.376
Would you mind checking again, please?

01:27:01.115 --> 01:27:04.434
Copy D.S., confirm the tickets, go!

01:27:17.340 --> 01:27:19.862
My apologies, they just came through.

01:27:26.710 --> 01:27:28.416
Swisair says they picked up the tickets.

01:27:28.435 --> 01:27:30.902
Get the L.A. office, tell them
to be ready, in case they call.

01:27:30.984 --> 01:27:33.554
We told them to shut that down.

01:28:04.736 --> 01:28:06.240
There you go.

01:28:22.980 --> 01:28:24.800
Not here.

01:29:27.536 --> 01:29:29.713
When did you come through Iran?

01:29:29.911 --> 01:29:31.526
Two days ago.

01:29:31.703 --> 01:29:33.752
What was the purpose of your visit?

01:29:34.384 --> 01:29:37.710
We are looking for locations for a film.

01:29:43.873 --> 01:29:45.792
— We have a….
— Oh, yeah,

01:29:45.865 --> 01:29:50.037
I’ve got a letter from
the Ministry of Culture.

01:29:50.754 --> 01:29:53.021
If you want to look at that.

01:30:14.817 --> 01:30:16.315
You can go.

01:30:25.105 --> 01:30:26.538
Come on, come on.

01:30:51.051 --> 01:30:52.366
Passports.

01:30:52.466 --> 01:30:54.256
No passports, no plane.

01:30:58.088 --> 01:30:59.626
Passports.

01:31:04.529 --> 01:31:06.141
Passports.

01:31:15.424 --> 01:31:16.771
[Farsi]

01:31:48.944 --> 01:31:50.246
We’re together yes, uh—

01:31:54.285 --> 01:31:56.648
Pierson’s telling Swissair
they’re not on the plane.

01:31:56.680 --> 01:31:58.006
They should have boarded already.

01:31:58.042 --> 01:31:59.918
Still no answer in L.A.

01:32:24.682 --> 01:32:25.672
Sir.

01:32:34.997 --> 01:32:38.233
[Farsi] Yeah uh, it’s a fantasy story
about a war in another world.

01:32:38.303 --> 01:32:40.300
Here you can see our notices.

01:32:40.611 --> 01:32:43.681
See? Argo is filmed in Iran.

01:32:45.412 --> 01:32:46.985
Of course I speak Farsi,

01:32:47.003 --> 01:32:49.466
I wish to make a movie in Iran.

01:33:06.602 --> 01:33:09.031
N—No, I’m… I’m now a writer, and uh…

01:33:10.236 --> 01:33:12.294
Kevin, give me the storyboards.

01:33:12.459 --> 01:33:16.687
These are the drawings that show
what we will film for the movie,

01:33:16.844 --> 01:33:19.362
Alien villains have taken over
the hero’s planet.

01:33:19.602 --> 01:33:22.630
They fight for their families
and take back the city,

01:33:22.712 --> 01:33:25.741
The villains know he is
the chosen one, so,

01:33:25.812 --> 01:33:29.857
they kidnap his son
in the spice market.

01:33:30.785 --> 01:33:33.032
So he and his wife storm the castle.

01:33:33.297 --> 01:33:36.700
The people—hold that…
the people are inspired to join him.

01:33:36.805 --> 01:33:41.223
They are farmers, but they learn to fight.

01:33:44.490 --> 01:33:47.203
They shoot weapons at their enemies.

01:33:49.481 --> 01:33:51.863
And the king of the aliens is destroyed,

01:33:51.864 --> 01:33:53.844
when the people find their courage.

01:34:02.934 --> 01:34:06.323
You don’t go until we verify.

01:34:09.435 --> 01:34:11.853
— I understand.
— Sir…

01:34:12.299 --> 01:34:14.084
Call our office.

01:34:14.202 --> 01:34:15.846
They’ll verify.

01:34:40.677 --> 01:34:42.611
.. It goes all the way
throughout the thirties.

01:34:42.643 --> 01:34:43.414
Hold on pal, we’re shooting.

01:34:43.415 --> 01:34:44.791
We’re just going to the
producer’s building.

01:34:44.830 --> 01:34:47.275
Yeah I understand, I understand
but we’re shooting.

01:35:21.398 --> 01:35:26.049
<i>Swissair announces final boarding
to flight 3‒6‒3 to Zurich.</i>

01:35:33.234 --> 01:35:35.054
Recess, back to one!

01:35:35.557 --> 01:35:37.286
— Alright, recess.
— We going again!

01:35:37.659 --> 01:35:40.611
Again, everyone!
And… we’re rolling!

01:35:40.641 --> 01:35:43.460
— We’re going to the producer’s building.
— Sorry, we’re rolling

01:36:19.355 --> 01:36:22.161
Sorry pal, we’re gonna be in the movie.
Call my agency.

01:36:22.196 --> 01:36:23.712
Sir!

01:36:35.814 --> 01:36:38.284
Studio 6 Productions.

01:36:38.390 --> 01:36:40.896
May I speak to a Mr. Kevin Harkins?

01:36:41.027 --> 01:36:44.310
I’m sorry, Mr. Harkins is out of
country on a location scout.

01:36:44.318 --> 01:36:46.079
May I take a message?

01:37:02.803 --> 01:37:06.317
Doors are closing for
flight 3‒6‒3 to Zurich.

01:37:15.004 --> 01:37:17.107
— We can go.
— Excellent.

01:37:24.753 --> 01:37:28.089
You can these. It’s a gift.

01:37:40.461 --> 01:37:43.269
[Farsi] Wait a moment.
Others are coming.

01:39:59.769 --> 01:40:03.225
Swissair 3‒6‒3, clearance for taxi.

01:40:05.145 --> 01:40:09.680
Swissair 3‒6‒3, you are
number two for departure.

01:40:57.620 --> 01:41:00.854
Swissair 3‒6‒3, you are
cleared for take off.

01:41:04.402 --> 01:41:07.047
Swissair 3‒6‒3,
clear for take off.

01:42:11.998 --> 01:42:15.346
— We got wheels up!
— Wait.

01:42:29.994 --> 01:42:32.313
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is our pleasure to announce

01:42:32.324 --> 01:42:34.394
that alcoholic beverages
are now available

01:42:34.397 --> 01:42:37.009
as we have cleared Iranian airspace.

01:43:25.228 --> 01:43:26.598
They’re clear.

01:43:27.318 --> 01:43:29.265
Yes! Yes!

01:43:33.762 --> 01:43:35.350
They’re out!

01:43:35.973 --> 01:43:37.740
They’re out. They’re out!

01:43:37.756 --> 01:43:39.576
Yes! We got them out!

01:43:42.205 --> 01:43:43.916
They’re out!

01:43:49.822 --> 01:43:51.989
Great work, boys.

01:43:52.077 --> 01:43:53.748
We’ve managed!

01:44:04.238 --> 01:44:07.546
You are admitted to the republic of Iraq.

01:44:52.767 --> 01:44:54.876
We made history today.

01:44:55.709 --> 01:44:59.151
“ History starts out as farce
and ends up as tragedy‟.

01:44:59.595 --> 01:45:01.492
Or it’s the other way around.

01:45:01.752 --> 01:45:02.956
And who said it?

01:45:03.122 --> 01:45:04.575
Marx.

01:45:05.285 --> 01:45:08.390
Groucho said that?

01:45:10.902 --> 01:45:13.884
Called ‘The Times’ to nail
it to the Goddamn door.

01:45:13.927 --> 01:45:15.285
CIA are the good guys.

01:45:15.297 --> 01:45:17.193
The Canadians are the good guys

01:45:17.497 --> 01:45:19.749
And if we’re not agreeing, them too.

01:45:19.791 --> 01:45:24.146
Only. Canada takes the credit, or
they’ll retaliate against the hostages.

01:45:25.201 --> 01:45:27.097
Great Satan wasn’t involved.

01:45:27.872 --> 01:45:29.923
No CIA.

01:45:30.014 --> 01:45:32.040
Is that right, Jack?

01:45:33.807 --> 01:45:35.718
Involved in what?

01:45:36.385 --> 01:45:39.595
We were surprised as anybody.

01:45:41.836 --> 01:45:43.695
Thank you, Canada.

01:45:43.837 --> 01:45:46.366
We knew that each day
that they stayed there,

01:45:46.367 --> 01:45:48.706
the danger was becoming greater.

01:45:48.802 --> 01:45:52.752
We had been looking for a solution to have
them to leave the country during the past—

01:45:52.779 --> 01:45:56.157
.. Day 87, and finally a sliver
of really good news…

01:45:56.229 --> 01:45:58.716
.. American department of State
hereby honors

01:45:59.315 --> 01:46:00.971
Joe Stafford…

01:46:01.580 --> 01:46:02.987
Kathy Stafford…

01:46:04.518 --> 01:46:06.119
Mark Lijek…

01:46:07.049 --> 01:46:09.857
The Americans will be forever grateful

01:46:09.910 --> 01:46:12.098
to our great and ally to the North,

01:46:12.110 --> 01:46:14.734
for the protection and safe passage,

01:46:14.832 --> 01:46:16.520
provided to our diplomats.

01:46:16.632 --> 01:46:17.886
Bob Anders…

01:46:18.276 --> 01:46:20.693
Here or anywhere in the world…

01:46:20.789 --> 01:46:22.661
Canada will pay…

01:46:24.060 --> 01:46:27.924
for this violation of the
sovereignty of Iran.

01:46:28.049 --> 01:46:32.578
.. ambassador Ken Taylor
and the great nation of Canada.

01:46:36.325 --> 01:46:38.589
So I’m sitting in Jerry’s this morning,

01:46:38.708 --> 01:46:40.343
I’m having breakfast.
Waitress comes over to me,

01:46:40.411 --> 01:46:42.216
she’s waving a newspaper, she says:

01:46:42.266 --> 01:46:44.054
“You see what those Canadians pulled off?

01:46:44.190 --> 01:46:46.300
Why can’t we do something like that?‟

01:46:46.429 --> 01:46:48.624
I said to her, do you know what I said?

01:46:48.807 --> 01:46:50.206
No, what?

01:46:50.362 --> 01:46:52.994
“Argo, fuck yourself!‟

01:47:20.964 --> 01:47:22.485
All set.

01:47:22.803 --> 01:47:24.623
Thanks a lot.

01:47:38.583 --> 01:47:41.344
And I left my autograph book at home.

01:47:46.629 --> 01:47:49.964
His eminence called me.
He wants to see you.

01:47:50.221 --> 01:47:52.751
Probably wants to fire me himself.

01:47:53.127 --> 01:47:56.319
He wants to give you
the Intelligence Star.

01:47:56.601 --> 01:47:58.432
You’re getting the highest award of merit

01:47:58.435 --> 01:48:02.115
of the clandestine services
of these United States.

01:48:02.925 --> 01:48:04.847
Ceremony’s on the fourteenth.

01:48:05.190 --> 01:48:08.949
If they push it a week I can bring
Ian, that’s his winter break.

01:48:09.839 --> 01:48:14.043
The op was classified. So…
the ceremony’s classified.

01:48:14.129 --> 01:48:17.761
He can’t know about it,
nobody can know about it.

01:48:18.892 --> 01:48:22.739
So they’re just gonna give me an award,
then they’re gonna take it back.

01:48:22.812 --> 01:48:24.549
That’s right.

01:48:25.489 --> 01:48:28.930
If we wanted applause we would
would have joined the circus.

01:48:29.112 --> 01:48:31.806
