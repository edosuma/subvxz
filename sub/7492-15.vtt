WEBVTT

00:03.500 --> 00:05.125
Okay, when it's halfway filled with water,

00:05.208 --> 00:06.625
you put the apples in like this.

00:09.792 --> 00:10.792
Seriously, Kim?

00:11.417 --> 00:13.583
You've been put in charge
of the school's Halloween party,

00:13.667 --> 00:15.792
and bobbing for apples
is the best you got?

00:16.375 --> 00:18.583
Actually, Jerry, it's kind of scary.

00:18.667 --> 00:20.834
Actually, Jerry, it's kind of scary.

00:23.083 --> 00:26.500
Am I gonna get a granny smith
or a red delicious apple--

00:34.625 --> 00:35.834
You're a sick woman, Kim.

00:38.417 --> 00:39.709
- Did you see his face?
- Yes.

00:40.625 --> 00:43.083
Guys, this party is gonna be epic.

00:43.500 --> 00:45.667
We just have to find a place
better than the school gym.

00:45.750 --> 00:47.583
Got my Halloween decorations.

00:48.041 --> 00:50.083
Uh, Rudy, you didn't get very much.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.917
Yes, he did!

00:55.959 --> 00:57.000
I'll go get the rest.

00:58.250 --> 01:00.208
We got ghosts, ghouls, goblins.

01:00.250 --> 01:02.709
If it starts with a G and scares children,
I bought it.

01:03.250 --> 01:04.208
Even got a guinea pig.

01:04.709 --> 01:05.917
Kids aren't afraid of guinea pigs.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.417
Oh, yeah, check this one out.

01:09.125 --> 01:12.792
Oh! You can't tell which is the face
and which is the butt.

01:13.709 --> 01:15.542
I found out the hard way
when I tried to kiss it.

01:17.083 --> 01:19.208
Hello, my wasabi friends.

01:19.291 --> 01:21.208
- Hey, Wan Chi!
- Wan Chi!

01:21.291 --> 01:22.125
Hit me up.

01:25.834 --> 01:27.375
I've come to ask a favor.

01:27.500 --> 01:29.583
We're hoping you can watch our temple
for two weeks.

01:29.667 --> 01:30.625
Why us?

01:30.709 --> 01:36.083
Because you possess
those rare gifts of patience, honor and--

01:36.166 --> 01:37.375
Everybody else said no?

01:37.667 --> 01:39.709
Most of them cut me off
at I've come to ask a favor.

01:40.542 --> 01:41.667
I got you covered.

01:41.750 --> 01:42.792
Are you travelling somewhere?

01:42.875 --> 01:44.875
We have been offered
a prestigious opportunity

01:44.959 --> 01:49.125
to perform our ancient Shaolin techniques
at the Pan-Asian Mung Bean Festival.

01:49.208 --> 01:52.125
Ah, the Mung Bean, my favorite legume.

01:54.417 --> 01:56.792
Jack and Kim are giving me
the I'm-a-geek look, aren't they?

01:56.875 --> 01:58.041
Not just Jack and Kim.

01:59.542 --> 02:00.625
Thank you, Milton.

02:00.709 --> 02:02.041
I know I can depend on you.

02:04.959 --> 02:09.000
Aha, bobbing for apples, nice.

02:12.041 --> 02:13.834
Oh, that's pretty good. Who's under there?

02:22.750 --> 02:24.250
I love Halloween.

02:26.417 --> 02:29.500

03:09.417 --> 03:12.834
We believe the temple is filled
with living energy called chi,

03:12.917 --> 03:14.417
which needs to be balanced.

03:16.834 --> 03:22.333
Now, the sand in the Zen garden
needs to be raked twice a day.

03:22.834 --> 03:25.375
And that will help me balance my own chi?

03:26.291 --> 03:28.417
No, but it will get
the neighbor's cat poop out of the sand.

03:30.083 --> 03:31.125
So where are your friends?

03:31.208 --> 03:34.542
Oh, Kim's planning a big Halloween party
and everyone else is helping.

03:35.000 --> 03:35.917
Why aren't you there?

03:36.250 --> 03:38.208
Never really been a big party guy.

03:38.250 --> 03:41.333
With the music
and the scandalous hors d'oeuvres

03:41.417 --> 03:43.500
and that tawdry dancing. Ugh.

03:43.583 --> 03:44.750
Uh, why would you want to do that

03:44.834 --> 03:46.667
when you can stay home
and get your science on?

03:47.458 --> 03:50.250
You remind me
of an ancient warrior Yoshimi.

03:50.667 --> 03:52.083
He didn't like to have fun either.

03:52.542 --> 03:53.750
Two hundred years ago,

03:53.834 --> 03:56.417
Yoshimi was in love
with the beautiful Mariko,

03:56.500 --> 03:58.250
but he never made time
to have fun with her.

03:58.333 --> 04:01.375
Well, I always make time
to have fun with the woman in my life.

04:01.458 --> 04:03.917
As a matter of fact,
I set an entire weekend aside

04:04.000 --> 04:05.709
just for candle-making with mother.

04:07.166 --> 04:10.750
When Mariko left him for another,
Yoshimi died of a broken heart.

04:11.208 --> 04:15.208
Legend has it, his spirit is trapped
in these temple walls

04:15.291 --> 04:17.750
waiting for a kiss from Mariko
to set him free.

04:18.417 --> 04:19.500
Well,

04:19.583 --> 04:22.458
when it comes to a kiss,
some girls are really worth waiting for.

04:22.542 --> 04:25.417
You know, it's the thrill of the hunt
that keeps you going back to the jungle.

04:25.500 --> 04:27.208
You know what I'm saying, huh?

04:27.250 --> 04:28.125
I really don't.

04:34.458 --> 04:36.458
This is going to be so cool.

04:36.834 --> 04:39.875
These severed heads and bloodied hands
are gonna scare everybody.

04:39.959 --> 04:42.166
They're not gonna scare me.

04:42.250 --> 04:45.625
I'm a sensei who spent years learning
how to eliminate all fear--

04:45.709 --> 04:46.959
Oh! Dead moth!

04:47.041 --> 04:48.625
Dead moth! Dead moth!

04:50.083 --> 04:53.125
What is all this?

04:53.208 --> 04:55.834
Oh, we're getting the dojo ready
for Halloween.

04:55.917 --> 04:58.125
Over my dead body.

04:58.208 --> 05:00.333
Oh, that is a great idea.

05:00.417 --> 05:02.875
You lie down with this fake hatchet
in your head.

05:05.542 --> 05:07.709
No dojo with my name on it

05:07.792 --> 05:10.041
will, in any way,
participate in Halloween!

05:12.667 --> 05:14.375
Why are you so down on Halloween?

05:14.458 --> 05:16.917
It's just such a pointless holiday.

05:17.000 --> 05:21.291
I mean, people wearing ridiculous jewelry,
gaudy outfits and oversized wigs--

05:21.375 --> 05:22.625
I mean, who does that?

05:25.166 --> 05:27.125
But these decorations are awesome.

05:27.208 --> 05:28.375
Really?

05:28.458 --> 05:29.750
Rubber bats, ooh!

05:30.542 --> 05:31.875
Fake body parts!

05:31.959 --> 05:34.291
Oh! Candy spiders...

05:34.333 --> 05:36.291
Please.

05:36.625 --> 05:38.375
No, no, that was actually a real spider.

05:40.250 --> 05:41.083
Are you okay?

05:41.166 --> 05:44.667
Well, it was just
a teensy-weensy little spider.

05:44.750 --> 05:47.500
I'm sure it was completely harmless.

05:49.458 --> 05:53.000
Remember what I said,
absolutely no Halloween!

06:15.250 --> 06:17.000
Uh, excuse me. Um...

06:17.375 --> 06:18.625
What do you think you're doing?

06:18.709 --> 06:20.667
Oh! When we were thinking
of where to have the party,

06:20.750 --> 06:22.333
I realized I had the perfect place.

06:22.417 --> 06:24.250
This creepy old courtyard
outside the temple.

06:25.041 --> 06:26.583
Well, not gonna happen, Kim.

06:27.041 --> 06:30.458
I'll alert the warriors
with the gong of temple violations.

06:30.542 --> 06:31.375
Oh, can I see that?

06:35.917 --> 06:38.583
Okay, I am having this party, Milton,
whether you like it or not.

06:38.667 --> 06:41.417
Well, let me tell you something, missy!

06:41.500 --> 06:42.750
I am in charge here.

06:42.834 --> 06:44.875
And I will use every fiber of my being

06:44.959 --> 06:46.667
to stop you from throwing
a Halloween party

06:46.750 --> 06:48.333
on these hallowed grounds.

06:49.625 --> 06:50.917
Oh, people, please.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.083
When you put your punch down,
use coasters.

06:53.166 --> 06:56.250
And Jerry! Stop diving into the koi pond.

06:56.333 --> 06:58.375
Underpants is not a bathing suit.

06:58.500 --> 06:59.875
<i>Whoo!</i>

07:00.959 --> 07:02.125
Gah!

07:04.083 --> 07:04.917

07:06.583 --> 07:07.750

07:11.959 --> 07:14.417
I suspect Bobby's deep-seated hatred
of Halloween

07:14.500 --> 07:16.375
is buried under years of repression.

07:16.458 --> 07:18.417
There's no way he's gonna tell us
what's behind it

07:18.500 --> 07:20.333
unless we're very clever and subtle.

07:20.417 --> 07:21.542
Hey, Bobby.

07:21.625 --> 07:23.375
What's your problem with Halloween?

07:25.667 --> 07:27.625
Finally, someone asks.

07:28.792 --> 07:32.500
When I was 11,
I trick-or-trat right here in this mall.

07:32.959 --> 07:37.041
My heart was filled with wonder
and my pumpkin was filled with treats.

07:59.667 --> 08:03.000
Well, you've associated Halloween
with that bad memory.

08:03.083 --> 08:04.959
Now, all we have to do
is associate Halloween

08:05.041 --> 08:06.959
with a happy memory and break the cycle.

08:07.041 --> 08:08.458
I appreciate it, Rudy,

08:09.083 --> 08:12.542
but I have got it under control.

08:15.750 --> 08:17.834
Get those monsters away from me!

08:21.208 --> 08:22.125
Milton!

08:22.208 --> 08:23.375
You're ruining my party.

08:23.458 --> 08:25.583
I mean, you kicked us out of the koi pond,
lowered the music,

08:25.667 --> 08:27.375
and took down our zip line.

08:27.709 --> 08:28.542
Yo!

08:29.083 --> 08:31.000
Check it out, people. My turn!

08:31.083 --> 08:32.208
Whoo! Whoa!

08:34.417 --> 08:35.709
Somebody should have told Jerry.

08:36.625 --> 08:39.667
Let's see what Wan Chi has to say
about your party when I call him.

08:39.750 --> 08:40.750
- Dude.
- Milton.

08:41.291 --> 08:43.166
Can I borrow your phone?

08:43.750 --> 08:45.208
I'm sorry, dude, I didn't bring my phone.

08:48.834 --> 08:49.917
What's that sound then?

08:50.333 --> 08:52.291
That is the sound...

08:52.792 --> 08:54.583
Of my new ringing pirate pants.

08:55.125 --> 08:58.291
Yeah, they alert me
when it's time to go to the bathroom.

08:59.250 --> 09:00.542
Gah!

09:05.291 --> 09:07.709
There has to be a phone here somewhere.

09:08.125 --> 09:10.792
Knowing the warriors
and their simple way of life,

09:11.125 --> 09:13.458
it's probably designed to fit in
with their decor.

09:14.500 --> 09:15.667
Aha.

09:16.208 --> 09:17.917
The old horse leg phone.

09:23.875 --> 09:24.792
Hello?

09:34.542 --> 09:35.375
Hm...

09:38.333 --> 09:39.291
Oh.

09:40.792 --> 09:42.208
Yoshimi's journal.

09:43.125 --> 09:44.500
This must have been his room.

09:57.500 --> 09:58.542
Who's there?

10:00.166 --> 10:01.083
Jerry?

10:01.417 --> 10:02.709
I know that's you.

10:02.792 --> 10:04.834
Oh, let's all scare Milton on Halloween.

10:04.917 --> 10:06.083
Well, it's not gonna work.

10:10.125 --> 10:11.959
Okay, it might be working a little bit.

10:27.834 --> 10:29.792
Yoshimi's back!

10:30.250 --> 10:33.250
And this time, he's gonna party.

10:38.125 --> 10:39.959
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you ♪</i>

10:47.375 --> 10:48.625
This party's a dud.

10:50.125 --> 10:52.500
Eyeball ice cubes in the punch,

10:52.583 --> 10:56.000
dirt cake and cupcakes
covered in fake mold...

10:58.250 --> 10:59.500
The mold is real, Albert.

10:59.583 --> 11:00.959
Jerry forgot to refrigerate 'em.

11:01.583 --> 11:02.834
Bleh, I don't like it.

11:04.041 --> 11:05.792
The only thing scary about this party

11:05.875 --> 11:08.333
is Jerry and his freaky friends
on the dance floor.

11:28.959 --> 11:30.000
Ah!

11:30.542 --> 11:32.667
Milton, did you know
that there's mold on these cupcakes?

11:32.750 --> 11:34.208
That is clearly a health-code violation--

11:38.709 --> 11:41.166
Whoa, what are you doing?

11:51.000 --> 11:52.291
What is he doing?

11:52.375 --> 11:54.583
I don't know, but I like it!

11:55.166 --> 11:59.959
Milton! Milton! Milton!

12:02.667 --> 12:07.709
So how is going into a Halloween maze
going to help Bobby overcome his fear?

12:07.792 --> 12:10.792
I came here every year as a kid
during Halloween time.

12:10.875 --> 12:13.208
Going through a Halloween maze
is a magical experience

12:13.291 --> 12:14.792
that can last a lifetime.

12:14.875 --> 12:16.875
So how come we're sneaking in?

12:16.959 --> 12:19.417
We're not gonna pay to get in.
It's just some crummy old maze.

12:20.458 --> 12:21.375
Come on.

12:34.750 --> 12:38.500
So what goes on in this maze
of Hallows' eve?

12:38.583 --> 12:39.542
Well, once you're in it,

12:39.625 --> 12:42.792
you try to find your way out of it
while scary characters jump out at you.

12:42.875 --> 12:44.250
- Oh.
- Don't worry.

12:44.333 --> 12:45.250
They're just actors.

12:45.333 --> 12:46.166
Actors.

12:46.458 --> 12:48.083
Hold it right there, you three!

12:48.792 --> 12:50.125
Where do you think you're going?

12:50.208 --> 12:51.709
Oh, I got this.

12:54.583 --> 12:59.458
We are but three lost souls ensnared
in your maze of terror!

13:02.542 --> 13:04.333
This is fun.

13:04.417 --> 13:06.625
Halloween maze closed down years ago.

13:07.083 --> 13:08.959
You're on Douglas' property now.

13:09.041 --> 13:10.917
And we don't stand for no trespassers.

13:13.291 --> 13:14.542
I don't think this guy's an actor.

13:14.625 --> 13:16.083
You're telling me.

13:16.166 --> 13:17.583
I didn't believe him for a moment.

13:17.667 --> 13:19.041
And who did your makeup?

13:19.125 --> 13:21.834
It looks like you glued a chinchilla
to your chin.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.959
Now see, that I believed.

13:25.250 --> 13:26.417
Bravo, sir!

13:26.500 --> 13:27.583
Bravo!

13:29.083 --> 13:30.041
- Bobby.
- Hmm?

13:30.125 --> 13:32.333
Um, I think this guy's the real thing.

13:34.083 --> 13:39.667
So, this wacko farmer really is a, uh...

13:40.875 --> 13:42.250
Wacko farmer?

13:44.041 --> 13:45.625
Run!

13:45.709 --> 13:48.166
- Go, guys!
- Get 'em, boys! Get 'em!

13:53.709 --> 13:55.291
Take it from me, ladies.

13:55.375 --> 13:57.583
Those buffalo wings have quite a kick.

14:03.500 --> 14:05.542
Milton, what's happening?

14:05.625 --> 14:07.583
Yoshimi's what's happening, honey.

14:08.083 --> 14:12.250
I've been trapped in these walls
for 200 years and I want to dance.

14:12.792 --> 14:14.875
Oh, forget you. Who's she?

14:17.709 --> 14:19.000
Can you believe that?

14:19.083 --> 14:21.583
What, that Milton thinks
he's some guy named Yoshimi?

14:21.667 --> 14:24.041
No, that he thinks Laura Bitterman
is cuter than me.

14:25.417 --> 14:29.125
- Pfft, where is that coming from?
- What is he thinking?

14:29.208 --> 14:30.041
Shut it.

14:30.542 --> 14:32.041
Hey, you guys keep an eye on Milton.

14:32.125 --> 14:33.500
I'm gonna go find out what's going on.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.375
-
- Where'd they go?

14:50.458 --> 14:52.208
- Look out! They're coming.
- Go, go, go.

14:52.250 --> 14:53.333
I don't know which way.

14:53.417 --> 14:55.250
It's like a maze in here.

14:58.208 --> 14:59.417
I am exhausted.

15:00.125 --> 15:01.959
I can't go on anymore.

15:02.041 --> 15:03.375
Look at what we got here!

15:05.875 --> 15:08.083
Rudy, Bobby, I'm scared.

15:08.166 --> 15:09.458
I just want to go home.

15:09.542 --> 15:11.875
I am never celebrating Halloween
ever again.

15:11.959 --> 15:14.250
Aww, little boy's scared.

15:16.792 --> 15:20.959
That is it, you backwards maze monsters!

15:22.041 --> 15:25.041
I had the joy of Halloween ruined for me.

15:25.458 --> 15:28.625
You are not going to ruin it for the boy!

15:28.959 --> 15:29.875
Yeah, Bobby's right.

15:30.375 --> 15:31.417
We're done running.

15:32.834 --> 15:34.875
You heard 'em, boys! Get 'em!

15:53.250 --> 15:54.875
Ow!
- Oh, that was nice.

15:57.625 --> 15:58.875
Oh!
-

16:03.542 --> 16:05.041
That was awesome, guys!

16:05.125 --> 16:06.083
Let's get out of here.

16:06.166 --> 16:10.166
And for the first time in a long time,
enjoy Halloween.

16:13.875 --> 16:14.917
Uh...

16:21.583 --> 16:22.750
Uh...

16:23.417 --> 16:24.667
This is a bit awkward.

16:24.750 --> 16:27.166
But could you kind gents
please direct us out of here?

16:28.542 --> 16:29.625
No, no, we'll figure it out.

16:34.417 --> 16:37.000
Guys, guys, I was in Yoshimi's room

16:37.083 --> 16:39.083
and this book explains
what happened to Milton.

16:39.166 --> 16:40.542
Book?

16:40.583 --> 16:42.792
Please, when has anyone ever learned
anything from a book?

16:44.166 --> 16:47.709
Yoshimi lost the love of his life, Mariko,
because he never had any fun.

16:48.166 --> 16:49.709
His spirit must
have been trapped in his room

16:49.792 --> 16:51.333
and it somehow entered Milton's body.

16:51.875 --> 16:54.041
Guys, Yoshimi's searching
for his lost love.

16:54.125 --> 16:55.041
Kim, please.

16:55.417 --> 16:58.125
Look, if you think we believe
that Milton is possessed by some...

17:02.834 --> 17:04.542
You know, I think Kim's onto something.

17:04.625 --> 17:06.792
Guys, yo, check this out.

17:06.875 --> 17:08.917
Does this sketch of Mariko
look like anybody we know?

17:10.041 --> 17:11.083
Oh.

17:11.500 --> 17:12.625
That looks like me.

17:12.709 --> 17:14.208
Kim. I meant Kim.

17:14.291 --> 17:15.125
Definitely Kim.

17:22.083 --> 17:24.375
Yo, I think he's getting mad
because he can't find Mariko.

17:24.792 --> 17:25.667
I think he's getting mad

17:25.750 --> 17:27.667
because those crab puffs
are all puff and no crab.

17:29.041 --> 17:31.542
We just have to keep Milton calm
until Kim's ready to come out.

17:35.458 --> 17:37.000
Uh, hey, buddy.

17:38.375 --> 17:39.375
How you doing?

17:40.709 --> 17:42.333
Look.

17:42.417 --> 17:44.333
Yoshimi, we know you're looking
for Mariko.

17:44.417 --> 17:45.375
Mariko!

17:45.458 --> 17:46.500
Where is she?

17:46.834 --> 17:48.750
Which one of you took her from me?

17:50.709 --> 17:51.709
He did.

17:51.792 --> 17:52.875
Wait!

17:53.667 --> 17:55.917
You probably shouldn't have done--

17:58.291 --> 18:00.583
You just got flipped by--

18:02.250 --> 18:03.083
Hey!

18:35.542 --> 18:37.875
Don't clap for that cheap magic trick.

18:37.959 --> 18:40.750
He's obviously being held up
by some kind of wire...

18:41.208 --> 18:42.500
that you can't see at all.

18:43.000 --> 18:44.917
So it looks like he's really flying.

18:47.750 --> 18:49.917
I mean, it really looks like he's flying.

18:51.375 --> 18:52.375
I believe.

18:52.917 --> 18:53.917
I believe!

18:54.000 --> 18:56.083
Fly, boy! Fly!

18:56.583 --> 18:58.875
Uh, if anybody's mom's here
to pick them up,

18:58.959 --> 19:00.041
I'd like a ride please.

19:03.166 --> 19:04.208
Yoshimi.

19:05.750 --> 19:07.208
It's me, Mariko.

19:07.834 --> 19:08.792
Mariko.

19:13.792 --> 19:14.917
Sweet Mariko.

19:15.291 --> 19:17.667
I've ridden the waves of time
for an eternity

19:17.750 --> 19:19.291
searching for you, my love.

19:19.375 --> 19:20.709
You found me, Yoshimi.

19:21.291 --> 19:22.917
Now, you can move on from this world.

19:23.500 --> 19:26.083
Well, I can't until you fulfill
your promise of a kiss.

19:26.166 --> 19:28.125
Absolutely. If that's what
I promised you, then--

19:28.208 --> 19:29.333
I'm sorry, a what now?

19:30.583 --> 19:34.166
I cannot move on to the next world
until your lips touch mine in this one.

19:39.166 --> 19:40.083
Fine.

19:40.792 --> 19:41.959
I will give you a kiss.

19:46.250 --> 19:47.750
But don't try anything fancy!

20:02.500 --> 20:03.792
- Milton.
- Hey, Milton.

20:04.375 --> 20:05.834
Dude, are you okay?

20:06.583 --> 20:08.125
I think so.

20:08.208 --> 20:09.250
Do you remember anything?

20:09.333 --> 20:11.625
No.

20:11.709 --> 20:14.166
Oh, dude, you turned
into this 200-year-old spirit,

20:14.250 --> 20:15.542
and I totally dominated you.

20:15.917 --> 20:17.208
Yeah, oh, and I loaned you 20 bucks.

20:17.250 --> 20:18.250
- Jerry.
- Sorry.

20:19.917 --> 20:21.917
Man, we're so glad you're back.

20:22.375 --> 20:25.250
Because of you, Kim was able to throw
the best Halloween party ever.

20:25.333 --> 20:26.583
But it's over now.

20:26.667 --> 20:29.250
Okay, let's wind the party down,
get things cleaned up and get out of here.

20:29.375 --> 20:30.583
Well, hang on a second.

20:31.250 --> 20:33.709
The whole school's here.
Everybody's having fun.

20:34.166 --> 20:35.834
Another couple hours won't hurt anybody.

20:37.083 --> 20:39.166
Wow, you've changed, Milton.

20:39.709 --> 20:41.917
Come on, Kim.
I'm the same guy I always was.

20:44.959 --> 20:47.458
Uh, no, I've changed, definitely changed.

20:54.041 --> 20:55.625
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you! ♪</i>

20:56.125 --> 20:57.500
Hey, Kim, um...

20:58.417 --> 21:01.041
I got to admit
this was a pretty great party.

21:01.917 --> 21:03.000
Thanks, Albert.

21:03.417 --> 21:07.500
You know, the spirit of Yoshimi
left Milton and I think he...

21:07.583 --> 21:09.166
went into me.

21:11.625 --> 21:14.166
And we know there's only one way
to get him out.

21:15.709 --> 21:16.750
Hmm.

21:16.834 --> 21:18.709
Oh! Ow!

21:19.291 --> 21:21.959
Is he out or should we do it again?

21:22.041 --> 21:23.917
No, he's out.

21:24.000 --> 21:24.875
Definitely out.

21:30.417 --> 21:31.959
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you! ♪</i>

21:56.917 --> 21:57.750
<i>Poor soul.</i>

22:01.875 --> 22:02.709
<i>Yes!</i>
