-Look, if you just
sat down with her,

06:13.832 --> 06:17.210

to get an apology.

an apology from the woman

Yung Gravy?
Oh, that sounds good.

-(scoffs)

07:38.458 --> 07:40.460
You love doing backflips
off motorcycles,

07:40.460 --> 07:42.253
it's like your favorite thing
in the world.

07:42.253 --> 07:43.797
-Why are you really here?
-I just said it.

07:43.797 --> 07:45.882
I'm done, I'm out. I'm old.

07:45.882 --> 07:48.426
-Dude, you're 28.
-That's my point.

07:48.426 --> 07:49.803
That's, like,
85 in stuntman years.

07:49.803 --> 07:52.806
And this last stunt, I mean,
it really took me out.

07:52.806 --> 07:54.599
But me going through that wall,

07:54.599 --> 07:56.184
it was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

07:56.184 --> 07:57.811
Yeah, I ended up
in this hospital

07:57.811 --> 08:00.480
with this old dude who blasts
Michael Bublé.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.315
And at first, I was like,
yo, this sucks,

08:02.315 --> 08:03.608
fake-ass Sinatra.

08:03.608 --> 08:06.736
But then, he put on
this song called "Home."

08:06.736 --> 08:08.905
You know what it got me
thinking about?

08:08.905 --> 08:11.866
-Let me guess-- home?
-Yes.

08:11.866 --> 08:14.661
But I realized that
when I think about home,

08:14.661 --> 08:16.454
I think about Zacky.

08:17.622 --> 08:21.209
Well, Zack and I
have been at home

08:21.209 --> 08:22.794
without you for a long time,

08:22.794 --> 08:25.797
and, um...
we're doing just fine.

08:25.797 --> 08:28.591
I know, and I'm not trying
to crowd you.

08:28.591 --> 08:30.719
I'd just...

08:30.719 --> 08:32.345

to be a part of it.

08:33.471 --> 08:34.681
I'm moving back.

08:34.681 --> 08:36.516
-You are?
-Yeah, yeah.

08:36.516 --> 08:38.893
I got an apartment in Everett
and everything.

08:38.893 --> 08:42.313
I just would love
to see you all more.

08:42.313 --> 08:44.733
Okay, that's--
that's a lot to lay on me

08:44.733 --> 08:46.317
right before I gotta fix a perm.

08:57.203 --> 08:59.914
No needs to feel awkward
about the silence.

08:59.914 --> 09:03.460
Silence allows us to reflect,

09:03.460 --> 09:05.420
to go within.

09:13.636 --> 09:16.181
I also don't want
to oversell the silence,

09:16.181 --> 09:17.807
'cause this feels like
it's a little long now.

09:17.807 --> 09:19.768
-Yeah, I'll start.
-Okay.

09:19.768 --> 09:21.186
I would like to submit

09:21.186 --> 09:23.605
that I skipped
my lunch break for this,

09:23.605 --> 09:25.774
and she still has not
apologized.

09:25.774 --> 09:28.401
Apologize for what?
For what?

09:28.401 --> 09:31.863
You have not explained what all
of my so-called failures are.

09:31.863 --> 09:35.658
Well, I shouldn't have to,
should I?

09:35.658 --> 09:36.826
'Cause those were
my private thoughts.

09:36.826 --> 09:38.411
That's not admissible.

09:38.411 --> 09:40.205
Oh, this is not a court of law,
I'm not really...

09:40.205 --> 09:42.415
Did I fail
when I bought a new car

09:42.415 --> 09:44.626
at an exorbitant rate

09:44.626 --> 09:46.503
because you totaled
my beloved Volvo?

09:46.503 --> 09:50.507
Did I fail when I forked over
40 grand for your rehab?

09:50.507 --> 09:52.967
Did I fail
when I let you off the hook

09:52.967 --> 09:55.678
after you didn't come home
when your father was sick?

09:55.678 --> 09:57.388
-(laughs)
-No, no, no. No.

09:57.388 --> 09:59.474
Those things are not
in your little book

09:59.474 --> 10:01.392
of "reasons I'm mad."

10:01.392 --> 10:02.560
Right, so I don't know
if you know

10:02.560 --> 10:04.395
what the term
"off the hook" means,

10:04.395 --> 10:06.439
'cause you're still
talking about it.

10:06.439 --> 10:08.274
My question has not
been answered.

10:08.274 --> 10:12.362
What did I do
to deserve such vitriol?

10:12.362 --> 10:17.367
Because I am not responsible
for your alcoholism, Samantha.

10:17.367 --> 10:19.202
Well, if you still see me

10:19.202 --> 10:21.704
as that drunk
from two years ago,

10:21.704 --> 10:23.456
then there's nothing to discuss.

10:27.794 --> 10:30.130
BOB:
Well, that was a good start.

10:31.798 --> 10:34.217
Okay, yeah,
Zack loves his dad.

10:34.217 --> 10:35.844
I mean, he's psyched
when Trent rolls into town

10:35.844 --> 10:37.595
and takes him to a movie
where someone

10:37.595 --> 10:40.890
gets their head chopped off,
and feeds him 14 Creamsicles.

10:40.890 --> 10:42.350
But what happens when he gets
another Mountain Dew commercial

10:42.350 --> 10:44.185
and leaves again?

10:44.185 --> 10:46.354
What happens if he doesn't?

10:46.354 --> 10:47.772
-Pete, we have sex.
-Yeah.

10:47.772 --> 10:49.274
So you're supposed to be
on my side automatically.

10:49.274 --> 10:51.693
No, no, no, I am. I am.
(chuckles)

10:51.693 --> 10:53.111
I just, um...

10:54.779 --> 10:57.323
Is there a chance that this
is good for you and Zacky?

10:57.323 --> 10:59.617
Don't do that.

10:59.617 --> 11:02.537
Don't act like
you're all deep and shit,

11:02.537 --> 11:03.788
and got all the answers.

11:03.788 --> 11:05.206
You don't know him
like I know him.

11:05.206 --> 11:06.499
No, I-I don't.

11:06.499 --> 11:08.459
And-and I don't want to be
an asshole here,

11:08.459 --> 11:10.003
but... (sighs)

11:12.172 --> 11:13.381
What if he's changed?

11:14.757 --> 11:17.177
You and Trent were like,
what, 19?

11:17.177 --> 11:18.678
I mean, you were just kids.

11:18.678 --> 11:20.263
FELICIA:
Yep.

11:20.263 --> 11:21.848
And I was the kid
who got stuck with a kid,

11:21.848 --> 11:23.600
and he was the kid who got to do
whatever he wanted.

11:25.268 --> 11:26.811
Hmm.

11:26.811 --> 11:29.355
Look, if Trent wants to spend
more time with Zacky,

11:29.355 --> 11:30.398
I think that's great.

11:32.275 --> 11:33.902
But I'll believe it
when I see it.

11:33.902 --> 11:35.695
I hope you get to see it.

11:37.822 --> 11:39.365
Why don't you give him a shot?

11:39.365 --> 11:42.452
Let him babysit,
and you and I can go out

11:42.452 --> 11:43.703
for a little night
on the town.

11:43.703 --> 11:45.246
Will there be steak?

11:45.246 --> 11:46.539
-You want steak?
-Yeah.

11:46.539 --> 11:47.749
Then there'll be steak.

11:50.251 --> 11:52.170
Sam, this stuff is great,

11:52.170 --> 11:53.630
it's gonna be perfect
for New York.

11:53.630 --> 11:54.923
I do want to change
a couple things, if you can...

11:54.923 --> 11:56.466
Cool, yeah,
I'll get to that later.

11:56.466 --> 11:58.218
(sniffling)

11:58.218 --> 12:00.345
What the hell, are...
you crying?

12:00.345 --> 12:02.639
No.
God, I'm just tired.

12:02.639 --> 12:04.265
Sam, no, no.
Sam, Sam, Sam.

12:04.265 --> 12:05.808
Listen to me for one second.

12:05.808 --> 12:08.478
As your mentor,
I want to just let you know

12:08.478 --> 12:10.813
that you cannot cry at work.

12:10.813 --> 12:13.316
You basically cried to me
last week.

12:13.316 --> 12:15.485
It's a double standard,
I'm aware of that.

12:15.485 --> 12:18.488
But when a man cries at work,

12:18.488 --> 12:22.825
it is essentially him, like,
shedding his toxic masculinity,

12:22.825 --> 12:25.203
and it's a show
of emotional strength.

12:25.203 --> 12:26.496
- And you know...
-No, it's not.

12:26.496 --> 12:27.830
Let's face it,
we both know that women

12:27.830 --> 12:29.540
just get hammered.

12:29.540 --> 12:32.210
They're emotional,
they're hysterical, and just...

12:32.210 --> 12:33.670
Okay, I'm going for a walk.

12:33.670 --> 12:36.130
Yeah, I know, Sam,
it is funny how allergies

12:36.130 --> 12:38.216
look like crying.
Get some Claritin.

12:38.216 --> 12:40.510
All right, guys, keep it up.
Great job.

19:51.399 --> 19:52.733
I'm in Poughkeepsie, New York,

19:52.733 --> 19:54.735
on a Balance Brothers retreat.

19:54.735 --> 19:56.362
MAN:
Tell her how you feel, bro.

19:56.362 --> 19:58.572
Yeah, listen.
Baby, I'm getting, like,

19:58.572 --> 20:00.491
into a real primeval mindset.

20:00.491 --> 20:03.327
-MAN: Open up.
-I am, okay? Just...

20:03.327 --> 20:05.788
I'm just-- I want you to know
that I know

20:05.788 --> 20:07.456
that I got a lot
of work to do,

20:07.456 --> 20:09.792
and it's work
that I want to do, okay?

20:09.792 --> 20:11.252
MAN:
Yeah, why should she
believe you?

20:11.252 --> 20:13.504
'Cause I've changed.
I've changed, baby!

20:13.504 --> 20:16.590
All right?
I left Boston, I came back here.

20:16.590 --> 20:18.634
I'm gonna hunker down
with these warriors,

20:18.634 --> 20:20.344
and I'm gonna make progress,

20:20.344 --> 20:22.555
and it's gonna come
from the heart, all right?

20:22.555 --> 20:24.807
Let-let me be
your only Yankee.

20:24.807 --> 20:28.185
Let me be your Yankee, I'm gonna
bat a thousand for you.

20:28.185 --> 20:30.604
I know I hurt you.
I want to make this right.

20:30.604 --> 20:32.773
I'm gonna put rose petals
on the bed.

20:32.773 --> 20:35.443
I'm gonna make
the swan towels like you like.

20:35.443 --> 20:36.652
-All right, Nate. Wrap it up.
-What's that? Okay, yeah.

20:36.652 --> 20:38.404
So, I gotta go.

20:38.404 --> 20:40.448
That was Coach Kevin,
we're going kayaking,

20:40.448 --> 20:42.283
so I'm gonna go do that.

20:42.283 --> 20:44.452
And when I come back,
I'm gonna be a changed man.

20:44.452 --> 20:46.495
I love you.
And also, real quick,

20:46.495 --> 20:48.372
Nestor, you're (bleep) dead!

20:48.372 --> 20:49.206
I'm gonna (bleep) kill you!
