00:07.675 --> 00:09.791
With the Tenkaichi Budokai
in the homestretch,

00:10.010 --> 00:14.720
No. 18 and Mister Satan were the
last two remaining in competition.

00:14.932 --> 00:18.424
It appeared that No. 18
would easily win the match,

00:18.644 --> 00:23.263
but motivated by the prize money,
she makes a deal with Mister Satan,

00:23.482 --> 00:25.939
and sells the victory to him.

00:26.151 --> 00:29.643
And so, the Tenkaichi Budokai comes to an end

00:29.863 --> 00:33.481
with Mister Satan as the repeat winner.

00:33.701 --> 00:38.070
Elsewhere, Dabra,
King of the Demon Realm of Darkness,

00:38.288 --> 00:40.700
stands in the way of Goku and the others

00:40.916 --> 00:45.831
as they attempt to put a stop to
the schemes of the Madoshi Babidi.

00:46.046 --> 00:48.753
At the height of his fierce fight with Dabra,

00:48.966 --> 00:52.458
Gohan at last unleashes his full power.

00:52.678 --> 00:56.512
Gohan challenges the demon king
with his power running wide open.

00:56.724 --> 01:00.308
But which way will the
outcome of this battle tilt?

01:00.519 --> 01:02.009
Oh, no!

01:04.772 --> 01:06.354
There you are!

01:08.777 --> 01:11.894
Even powered up,
that's still the best you've got?

01:14.158 --> 01:18.618
Damn! I may have let my guard down,
but that won't happen again!

01:19.872 --> 01:21.578
We're just getting started!

"A Heart of Evil Awakened--
Vegeta, Prince of Destruction!"

02:59.179 --> 03:02.342
Dabra's a lot stronger
than we thought, ain't he?

03:02.558 --> 03:05.846
Hmph! Be that as it may,
he's not an unbeatable opponent.

03:06.061 --> 03:10.100
How pathetic of him!
He was stronger back when he was a kid!

03:10.315 --> 03:12.522
Geez, what am I gonna do with you, Gohan?

03:12.734 --> 03:14.986
You really have been slacking off, huh?

03:15.195 --> 03:17.652
Tch, this really pushes my buttons!

03:21.952 --> 03:25.740
No good, no good, Gohan. If you keep
your attacks that monotonous,

03:25.956 --> 03:27.742
he's gonna read your next move.

03:27.958 --> 03:29.664
It's no use.

03:29.877 --> 03:33.210
He's completely forgotten
all of his fighting instincts.

03:52.316 --> 03:54.022
Why, that...

03:54.234 --> 03:58.193
Here I come!

03:58.405 --> 04:00.737
Watch out! You'll be turned to stone!

04:04.578 --> 04:06.068
Why, you...!

04:12.753 --> 04:16.541
Whew! That was a close one!

04:16.757 --> 04:20.045
Damn! What are you doing, Dabra?!

04:20.260 --> 04:23.627
You've got to deliver a lot
more damage than that!

04:23.847 --> 04:28.967
But then, as long as Majin Boo
is revived, those guys will be...

04:40.781 --> 04:41.816
You're mine!

04:42.032 --> 04:43.522
What?!

04:51.249 --> 04:53.331
Did you get him for good this time?!

05:06.765 --> 05:08.630
Damn it, Gohan...

06:13.540 --> 06:15.041
What?!

06:30.432 --> 06:33.515
Damn, this is irritating.

06:33.727 --> 06:36.218
All right, I'm going to put an end to this.

06:36.438 --> 06:39.180
You can't do that, Vegeta! Let him keep going!

06:39.399 --> 06:41.890
It ain't like he's completely
losing to him, after all.

06:42.110 --> 06:44.601
None of this fooling around matters!

06:45.614 --> 06:47.855
I want to put an end to this right now,

06:48.075 --> 06:50.407
so I can hurry up and settle the score with you!

06:50.619 --> 06:54.362
That's the whole reason why I went
to that ridiculous tournament!

06:54.581 --> 06:59.200
If this drags out any longer,
I'll bring it to a close in a flash!

07:02.047 --> 07:05.835
Babidi-sama, please return us
to the spaceship.

07:06.051 --> 07:08.588
ljust made an outstanding discovery.

07:08.804 --> 07:10.260
An outstanding discovery?

07:10.472 --> 07:13.259
It will allow Majin Boo to be revived.

07:13.475 --> 07:16.638
W-What? Are you sure about this, Dabra?

07:16.853 --> 07:17.763
Probably.

07:17.979 --> 07:19.389
You need to come back, then?

07:19.606 --> 07:23.349
--Yes, sir.
--Papparapa!!

07:26.446 --> 07:29.734
--What?!
--Huh? We've come back!

07:31.535 --> 07:33.241
Hey! Are you running away?!

07:33.453 --> 07:36.866
Running? Hm-hm-hm, no, I'm not.

07:37.082 --> 07:39.243
|, Dabra, need not even fight.

07:39.459 --> 07:43.043
l have found just the right warrior among you.

07:47.092 --> 07:49.128
Ah! Hold it!

07:49.344 --> 07:50.754
Dabra--

07:50.971 --> 07:54.714
the demon king, of all people,
has abandoned the fight?

07:59.146 --> 08:02.809
Just the right warrior...? What does that mean?

08:05.402 --> 08:07.688
So what is this about, Dabra?

08:07.904 --> 08:11.772
There really is an outstanding discovery, right?

08:11.992 --> 08:13.152
Yes, sir.

08:13.368 --> 08:16.860
It's not, of course, that you
became afraid of those people

08:17.080 --> 08:20.163
and came running back to me, is it?

08:20.375 --> 08:26.041
Hmm... Dabra, King of the
Demon Realm, fears nothing.

08:26.256 --> 08:28.668
All right, then. Never mind that--

08:28.884 --> 08:31.967
hurry up and tell me what
this outstanding discovery is.

08:32.179 --> 08:36.467
One among their number possesses
a very powerful evil in his heart.

08:36.683 --> 08:40.049
That much evil would be more
than enough to turn him to our side.

08:40.270 --> 08:42.932
Is that right? We wouldn't even have to fight;

08:43.148 --> 08:46.060
we could just make them fight
each other, and take the energy!

08:46.276 --> 08:47.686
By doing so...

08:47.903 --> 08:50.394
Majin Boo will be revived.

08:51.781 --> 08:54.648
Well done! Well done, Dabra!

09:07.172 --> 09:09.754
Just what does he think he's doing?

09:09.966 --> 09:12.582
I want to know what you think you're doing!

09:18.934 --> 09:21.346
How could you fail to bring
down someone of his level?!

09:21.561 --> 09:24.724
If you are the balance of our warrior race,
then once you start fighting,

09:24.940 --> 09:27.647
you make damn sure your opponent
isn't breathing when it's over!

09:28.652 --> 09:30.267
You guys are too soft!

09:30.487 --> 09:35.572
You always play at fighting
for what's right! It disgusts me!

09:35.784 --> 09:39.072
Power is what wins a fight!
Those who are strong survive,

09:39.287 --> 09:43.246
while those who are weak die!
Power is utterly everything!

09:43.458 --> 09:44.994
Look at Piccolo and Kuririn!

09:45.210 --> 09:47.952
They were turned to stone
solely because they are weak!

09:48.171 --> 09:50.662
Hmph! That's what they get!

09:50.882 --> 09:55.251
That's right. If only I had defeated Dabra,

09:55.470 --> 09:59.008
Piccolo-san and Kuririn-san would
have been returned to normal.

10:02.435 --> 10:05.017
That's enough; cut him some slack, Vegeta.

10:05.230 --> 10:07.687
Gohan hung in there
pretty well, in his own way.

10:07.899 --> 10:10.231
I told you, Kakarrot!

10:10.443 --> 10:12.775
I want to put an end to this
fooling around right now,

10:12.988 --> 10:15.445
so I can settle the score with you!

10:15.657 --> 10:18.740
Damn it! My patience is wearing very thin!

10:18.952 --> 10:21.113
Babidi, the Majin, or whatever...

10:21.329 --> 10:24.071
l'll vaporize them all,
together with this spaceship!

10:24.291 --> 10:27.033
--This is the end of it!
--That is crazy, Vegeta-san!

10:27.252 --> 10:30.619
If you do that, Majin Boo will be revived!

10:31.631 --> 10:34.964
Majin Boo is a monster who causes
nothing but death and destruction!

10:35.176 --> 10:36.507
He is literally a dark magic being,

10:36.720 --> 10:39.132
against whom not even four
of the Kaioshin could stand!

10:39.347 --> 10:40.382
SHence!

10:40.598 --> 10:43.431
lf Majin Boo is revived, all mankind--

10:43.643 --> 10:46.931
no, all living creatures will be wiped out,

10:47.147 --> 10:49.388
and Earth will indisputably
become a dead world.

10:49.607 --> 10:51.108
Be quiet!

10:52.694 --> 10:58.610
I don't give a damn how many people die,
or what happens to Earth!

10:58.825 --> 11:00.736
How can you...?!

11:02.537 --> 11:04.402
Knock it off already, Vegeta!

11:04.622 --> 11:06.203
Kakarrot!

11:13.882 --> 11:16.464
It's strange what happened here, though.

11:16.676 --> 11:19.543
Yes. It was the perfect chance
for them to collect

11:19.763 --> 11:22.470
all the energy they require to revive the Majin.

11:22.682 --> 11:24.764
So why would Dabra...?

11:25.769 --> 11:29.887
I ain't sure, but I do know he said

11:30.106 --> 11:35.226
he didn't even need to fight,
and that he found the right warrior.

11:44.704 --> 11:47.411
He found... a warrior...!

11:49.125 --> 11:51.241
H-He couldn't mean...!

12:15.110 --> 12:17.977
It's true! He's not like the others!

12:18.196 --> 12:23.236
You were right! His heart is full of evil!

12:23.451 --> 12:26.534
He didn't come here for
the sake of what's right!

12:26.746 --> 12:30.580
--No, sir.
--Well done! Well done, Dabra!

12:32.377 --> 12:34.868
Now they can fight among themselves,

12:35.088 --> 12:37.830
and with the energy we receive from them,

12:38.049 --> 12:41.541
Majin Boo is certain to be revived.

12:42.929 --> 12:46.638
I'm going to make good use of you!

13:17.464 --> 13:18.954
Veg eta-san!

13:26.973 --> 13:29.180
Damn it...!

13:29.392 --> 13:31.428
That's it, all right!

13:51.623 --> 13:54.330
Kaioshin-sama, what is this?!

13:54.542 --> 13:56.624
Vegeta-san, keep hold of yourself!

13:56.836 --> 14:00.920
Babidi is trying to take advantage
of the evil in your heart!

14:02.258 --> 14:04.374
Babidi is using the evil in his heart?

14:04.594 --> 14:08.007
Correct! Madoshi Babidi
is able to freely manipulate

14:08.223 --> 14:10.589
those who have evil in their hearts!

14:10.808 --> 14:14.096
You don't mean the warrior
that Dabra found is...

14:18.691 --> 14:21.182
Vegeta-san, you must empty your mind!

14:21.402 --> 14:23.563
You must not think about anything!

14:25.031 --> 14:28.740
Sh-Shut up! Stop your prattling!

14:33.373 --> 14:37.286
Good! Good! You're all mine now!

14:40.046 --> 14:43.004
All right! While I'm at it,
I'll take your dormant powers

14:43.216 --> 14:46.299
and draw them out beyond their limits for you!

15:06.698 --> 15:08.734
W-What is this?!

15:18.251 --> 15:19.832
His power is awesome!

15:20.044 --> 15:21.454
Veg eta-san!

15:21.671 --> 15:25.539
No, Vegeta-san! Don't let that guy control you!

15:27.010 --> 15:28.500
Gohan!

15:31.389 --> 15:33.004
Veg eta-san!

16:08.885 --> 16:11.672
What a KI! I can't get near him!

16:11.888 --> 16:13.424
Curse you, Babidi!

16:24.984 --> 16:26.394
Veg eta-san!

16:26.611 --> 16:28.351
Vegeta...

16:28.571 --> 16:30.607
Hey, Vegeta!

16:32.367 --> 16:33.857
Just a moment, please!

16:38.456 --> 16:40.538
It's too late for him.

16:40.750 --> 16:42.911
O-Oh, no...

17:04.022 --> 17:04.808
Vegeta!

17:05.023 --> 17:08.608
Vegeta-san! Please, snap out of it, Vegeta-san!

17:08.819 --> 17:13.984
Imagine... Imagine, Babidi getting us
to go after each other...

17:18.954 --> 17:22.789
Good! Good! You are now my servant.

17:23.000 --> 17:27.084
All right, why don't we put you
in an ideal place to fight?

17:27.296 --> 17:29.252
Papparapa!!

17:29.465 --> 17:30.500
W-What?!

17:30.717 --> 17:34.005
He is planning to move us
to another location again!

18:07.420 --> 18:10.833
--Satan-sama!
--Satan-sama!

18:13.551 --> 18:15.837
l'm Champion!

18:16.053 --> 18:18.260
Way to go, Mister Satan!

18:18.473 --> 18:21.135
Mister Satan, you're so handsome!

18:33.321 --> 18:34.777
l-ls this...

18:34.989 --> 18:36.945
...the tournament grounds?

18:40.453 --> 18:44.617
It's no illusion. This is definitely
the tournament grounds.

18:44.832 --> 18:46.823
W-Who are those guys?

18:47.043 --> 18:48.328
They just suddenly appeared.

18:48.544 --> 18:52.457
Goku? Look, it really is Goku and the others!

18:52.673 --> 18:54.413
What's going on here?

18:57.303 --> 18:59.919
Ha! lt's Goku-sa! And Gohan, too!

19:00.139 --> 19:01.640
Vegeta!

19:08.356 --> 19:10.642
Man, now they come back?

19:10.858 --> 19:13.440
The Tenkaichi Budokai's winner
has already been decided!

19:13.653 --> 19:16.895
What good is this goin' to do
our family finances?

19:17.114 --> 19:17.944
I know!

19:18.157 --> 19:21.490
They can beat up Mister Satan now,
and take the prize money!

19:21.702 --> 19:22.953
That's crazy.

19:23.162 --> 19:25.699
Crazy? If they beat the
champion black and blue

19:25.915 --> 19:29.248
while everyone else is watchin',
nobody's goin' to complain.

19:29.460 --> 19:32.122
Th-That might be true, but...

19:32.338 --> 19:35.796
Hold on a second.
There's something not right down there.

19:44.642 --> 19:48.430
Ah! You're kind of late, aren't you, Son-san?

19:48.646 --> 19:51.183
Where exactly did you go off to?

19:52.233 --> 19:53.723
Watch out!

20:13.004 --> 20:17.373
Now, what was his name, again? Let's see...

20:17.592 --> 20:19.958
Right, right, Vegeta!

20:21.470 --> 20:25.588
Take their energy away from them!
Fight them as hard as you can!

20:25.808 --> 20:27.173
You can even kill them!

20:27.393 --> 20:31.056
Shut up! My only objective here is Kakarrot.

20:31.272 --> 20:33.638
None of the others matter to me!

20:33.858 --> 20:36.144
Vegeta, did you...

20:36.360 --> 20:42.151
W-What a stubborn man! He is still
not completely under my control.

20:42.366 --> 20:45.449
I've never seen anyone like this before.

20:45.661 --> 20:48.277
W-Well, it doesn't really matter, though.

20:48.497 --> 20:50.533
V-V-Vegeta.. .!

20:50.750 --> 20:54.163
Confound it, Vegeta!
What the hell are you thinking?!

20:56.172 --> 21:02.793
Th-Th-Those are the guys...
from back... from back...

21:04.931 --> 21:10.176
O-Oh, no... Th-They're still alive?!

21:20.947 --> 21:24.235
Vegeta is under Babidi's control!

21:24.450 --> 21:28.238
Is this the fateful showdown, at last?

22:41.819 --> 22:43.229
Heya! I'm Goku!

22:43.446 --> 22:46.153
Damn that Babidi!
He's trying to get Vegeta and us

22:46.365 --> 22:49.732
to fight each other here at
the Tenkaichi Budokai grounds!

22:49.952 --> 22:52.068
What's come over you, Vegeta?

22:52.288 --> 22:54.153
Blowing up the arena with
the spectators still in it?

22:54.373 --> 22:56.113
This is some kind of mistake, right?

22:56.333 --> 22:57.869
Next time on Dragon Ball Z Kai,

22:58.085 --> 23:01.873
"I Am the Strongest!
The Clash of Goku vs. Vegeta."

23:02.089 --> 23:05.502
How could Babidi do
such an underhanded thing?
