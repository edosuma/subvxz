01:36.840 --> 01:40.754
Every nine years,
we travel to
the temple at Uppsala

01:42.880 --> 01:44.872
to give thanks to
the gods and to offer

01:45.000 --> 01:47.310
them sacrifices for
all they do for...

01:48.200 --> 01:51.398
For protecting us,
for the success in battle,

01:52.160 --> 01:55.198
for the rains that they bring
that grow our crops

01:55.520 --> 01:56.874
and, of course,

01:58.200 --> 01:59.714
for our children.

02:03.800 --> 02:05.996
This year I was
not going to go,

02:06.120 --> 02:08.351
for there is too
much to do around here.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.673
Then my unborn son

02:15.120 --> 02:17.271
was cruelly taken from me,

02:21.240 --> 02:25.075
and it made me wonder
what I had done
to anger the gods.

02:37.200 --> 02:40.398
What do Christians
do about such pain?

02:42.560 --> 02:46.156
In the Bible, it says
that all sorrows will pass.

02:48.760 --> 02:50.080
In any case,

02:51.480 --> 02:53.358
I've decided to go.

02:54.240 --> 02:57.517
I'm going to take the children
for the first time,

02:57.720 --> 02:59.791
for it's important
that they go.

03:00.280 --> 03:01.839
What about you?

03:04.000 --> 03:05.514
Me?

03:05.920 --> 03:07.115
What about me?

03:07.440 --> 03:09.033
Will you come with us?

03:12.080 --> 03:14.470
Or perhaps you would
prefer to stay here

03:15.240 --> 03:17.800
and worship your own god?

03:23.440 --> 03:26.797
No, I'll gladly come with you.

03:27.480 --> 03:28.800
Good.

03:29.160 --> 03:30.958
I would have
taken you anyway.

03:37.760 --> 03:40.514
A gift for the gods,
for the children.

03:44.680 --> 03:47.320
I pray for my
daughter's recovery.

03:49.680 --> 03:51.399
A gift for the gods.

03:51.480 --> 03:53.676
Pray for health
and prosperity.

04:02.840 --> 04:04.752
My gift for the gods.

04:04.840 --> 04:08.038
I ask their
blessings for my son.

04:11.240 --> 04:14.074
Gyda, you take
the offerings.

04:14.760 --> 04:16.877
For the gods in
thanks for my new baby.

04:17.360 --> 04:19.079
Thank you.

04:22.960 --> 04:24.360
Ragnar,

04:26.960 --> 04:29.350
are you not happy
that we're going to Uppsala?

04:30.160 --> 04:31.753
Of course I'm happy.

04:33.680 --> 04:36.354
Why should I not be happy?

04:38.280 --> 04:40.033
When we reach Uppsala,

04:42.040 --> 04:44.350
we shall ask the gods
why they give with one hand,

04:44.520 --> 04:46.193
but take away with the other?

04:47.120 --> 04:51.558
Why did they make me Earl,
yet kill my son?

04:53.120 --> 04:55.191
We can have more sons.

04:56.400 --> 04:58.119
Have we not tried?

05:59.360 --> 06:00.510
Arne.

06:08.280 --> 06:10.636
Gyda, step up.

06:11.760 --> 06:14.116
Careful.
Ragnar.

06:53.480 --> 06:55.073
Uppsala!

07:08.640 --> 07:09.915
Floki!

07:13.240 --> 07:14.230
Ah!

07:35.120 --> 07:36.713
Here's the sacred grove.

07:38.720 --> 07:42.191
Go and hang all the people's
offerings from the spouse.

08:08.480 --> 08:09.960
Does he know?

08:11.400 --> 08:12.834
No.

08:57.480 --> 08:59.756
Hail to the Aesir
and the Vanir.

09:00.120 --> 09:03.192
Hail to
the gods and goddesses.

09:03.600 --> 09:07.037
Hail to Odin, Thor and Freyr.

09:07.200 --> 09:09.669
Hail to Vali,
Sif and Heimdall.

09:11.320 --> 09:14.870
Hail to Balder, Bragi and Eir.

09:15.520 --> 09:18.319
Hail to Freyr, Loki and Frigg.

09:19.120 --> 09:21.476
Hail to Hlín and Mimir.

09:23.160 --> 09:26.153
Hail to Njord,
Ran and Tyr.

09:27.280 --> 09:30.512
Hail to Odin's spear,
Thor's hammer.

09:31.280 --> 09:34.318
Hail to
the mighty fecund earth.

09:34.520 --> 09:35.795
All...

09:38.320 --> 09:39.549
All hail.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.229
All hail.

09:41.320 --> 09:42.879
All hail.

09:52.400 --> 09:54.869
You know who
that is, don't you?

09:55.840 --> 09:57.115
Of course.

09:57.720 --> 10:01.316
This is Thor holding
his hammer, Mjollnir.

10:01.600 --> 10:04.354
Who hasn't heard him
beating his
anvil in the storm?

10:05.320 --> 10:09.280
Who doesn't
believe in mighty Thor,
slayer of frost and fire?

10:09.360 --> 10:11.636
Freyr, Loki and Frigg.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.799
Hail to Hlín and Mimir.

10:15.400 --> 10:18.234
Hail to Njord, Ran and Tyr.

10:18.720 --> 10:20.040
Hail to Odin...

10:28.200 --> 10:30.396
Freyr, Lord,

10:31.240 --> 10:34.836
fill me with seed
and give me a son.

10:36.400 --> 10:38.312
Do as you will with me,

10:38.920 --> 10:41.560
make me blind or
deaf if you want to,

10:42.040 --> 10:43.952
but give me a son.

10:47.160 --> 10:50.836
Accept the sacrifices
of blood we make to you,

10:51.600 --> 10:53.432
the honor we offer you.

10:55.400 --> 10:56.595
My lord,

10:59.440 --> 11:00.669
make me conceive again

11:00.760 --> 11:02.717
before it's too late.

11:06.960 --> 11:08.030
Hail to...

11:08.160 --> 11:09.230
All hail.

11:14.080 --> 11:17.391
Hail to Freyr,
Loki and Frigg.

11:17.520 --> 11:22.959
Odin, Father.
I have come to
ask for your love.

11:23.160 --> 11:28.189
I want to grow and to prosper,
to be quicken and to be wise.
Hear me, Lord.

11:28.720 --> 11:30.518
All hail.

11:33.400 --> 11:36.279
Hail to the Aesir
and the Vanir.

11:36.360 --> 11:39.000
Hail to the gods
and goddesses.

11:39.880 --> 11:41.553
Lord of lords,

11:43.160 --> 11:44.753
Father,

11:45.640 --> 11:47.632
hear my prayer.

11:48.920 --> 11:50.912
Let me understand your will.

11:52.800 --> 11:55.679
Is it true that I
shall have more sons

11:56.400 --> 11:58.756
like the Seer says?

12:00.600 --> 12:04.799
Accept the sacrifice
I plan to offer you,

12:06.560 --> 12:08.358
and then answer me.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.799
Hail to the Aesir
and the Vanir.

12:13.920 --> 12:16.913
Hail to the gods
and goddesses.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.878
Hail to Odin, Thor...

12:19.000 --> 12:21.674
Who will bear me my son?

12:21.800 --> 12:24.076
...Sif and Heimdall.

12:24.160 --> 12:27.278
Hail to Balder...

12:28.360 --> 12:31.353
Hail to Freyr, Loki and Frigg.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.832
How good is this, Rollo?

12:37.000 --> 12:38.957
Especially because
we're here together.

12:39.040 --> 12:40.360
Yes,

12:40.840 --> 12:44.470
while we're here in Uppsala,
let us enjoy and revel
in every moment.

12:53.400 --> 12:55.153
Have you been
here before, Helga?

12:55.280 --> 12:57.033
No.

12:57.240 --> 12:58.674
Do you know
what happens here?

12:58.960 --> 13:00.679
I've heard some stories.

13:00.800 --> 13:02.359
And they're all true.

13:03.760 --> 13:06.594
But they still don't
prepare you for
what really happens here.

13:09.120 --> 13:11.191
I can't wait to find out.

13:12.600 --> 13:15.354
When is the food
ready, Helga?

13:15.760 --> 13:17.399
I'm hungry.

13:18.800 --> 13:20.393
You're always hungry.

13:20.680 --> 13:22.831
Of course I am,

13:23.200 --> 13:25.431
but not always for food.

13:33.720 --> 13:35.393
Can you feel it, Gyda?

13:36.560 --> 13:41.077
Can you sense the presence
of the gods gathering here?

13:41.280 --> 13:44.000
They have left their
bright halls to see us.

13:44.280 --> 13:46.351
They are here for sure.

13:46.560 --> 13:48.040
They walk among us.

13:48.120 --> 13:50.112
And make their
judgments on us.

13:50.400 --> 13:52.676
So when do we
offer our sacrifices?

13:53.960 --> 13:56.031
At the end of the festival.

13:56.160 --> 13:58.675
And in the meantime,
we celebrate the gods

13:58.760 --> 14:01.992
and enjoy their presence
in any way we can.

14:03.560 --> 14:04.994
Give Athelstan a drink.

14:08.800 --> 14:11.269
Priest, your cup.

14:16.760 --> 14:19.320
Mother,
you came here before?

14:19.480 --> 14:20.675
Once.

14:20.760 --> 14:23.195
And did you ask
the gods for anything?

14:23.280 --> 14:24.953
Yes.

14:25.280 --> 14:27.875
And they granted
my every desire.

15:01.520 --> 15:02.795
What is this?

15:04.600 --> 15:06.990
These will all be
killed as sacrifices.

15:10.120 --> 15:11.713
Six, seven, eight, nine.

15:12.680 --> 15:13.750
Seven, eight, nine.

15:13.840 --> 15:16.309
And nine goats and nine pigs.

15:16.400 --> 15:17.880
There's nine of everything!

15:17.960 --> 15:19.235
Yes,

15:19.680 --> 15:21.273
nine of every kind.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.150
And this?

15:27.520 --> 15:31.196
It's for all the humans
that have been chosen.

16:23.680 --> 16:25.433
Come join us, priest.

16:32.720 --> 16:34.074
Drink.

16:34.200 --> 16:36.476
Drink to the nights
and to the gods.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.593
And

16:43.400 --> 16:44.516
eat these.

17:41.240 --> 17:46.315
I heard a rumor today that
King Horik himself may
attend the festival.

17:49.560 --> 17:51.119
It is not a rumor.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.196
I desire to meet him.

17:55.160 --> 17:59.632
There are great stories
and legends told about him.

18:03.680 --> 18:05.160
Thank you.

18:20.080 --> 18:22.914
You want to go out there,
don't you?

18:27.520 --> 18:29.034
Please stay.

18:31.360 --> 18:33.317
Why can't you stay?

21:03.240 --> 21:04.469
Priest...

21:20.240 --> 21:22.118
You are surely
not tired, Athelstan.

21:24.640 --> 21:26.836
Not on this great
journey you have begun

21:27.480 --> 21:28.994
and must finish.

21:34.800 --> 21:36.314
Leif,

21:38.040 --> 21:40.430
if you let me go,
I will fall again.

21:41.080 --> 21:44.391
No, the gods will hold you.

22:12.240 --> 22:13.720
Priest,

22:14.320 --> 22:16.755
I have been waiting for you.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.640
Gyda, what is it, child?

23:21.160 --> 23:22.640
I am bleeding.

23:25.960 --> 23:30.000
Then you are
no longer a child.
Forgive me.

23:30.080 --> 23:33.198
You are a woman.

23:38.000 --> 23:42.119
But let me cradle you
in my arms a last time,

23:42.200 --> 23:44.078
as I always used to do.

23:46.920 --> 23:49.913
It is hard for me
to let go of you.

24:23.680 --> 24:25.399
Why do you do this, Thyri?

24:27.040 --> 24:28.713
Don't you understand?

24:29.800 --> 24:31.678
I have to.

25:22.280 --> 25:24.272
Priests, stir yourselves!

25:25.400 --> 25:27.596
You ignorant peasant!
Wake up!

25:28.200 --> 25:29.429
How dare you disturb us!
Wake up!

25:29.520 --> 25:32.319
Get out!
Get out of the temple!

25:32.680 --> 25:38.517
Priests!
If you value your lives,
stop this at once.

25:38.640 --> 25:40.711
Fools! This is King Horik.

26:07.320 --> 26:11.394
Athelstan, I want
you to meet someone.

26:25.320 --> 26:28.996
You must be Ragnar Lothbrok!

26:32.600 --> 26:36.674
I must tell you it is
my privilege and pleasure
to clap eyes on you.

26:37.080 --> 26:39.436
Your reputation
goes ahead of you,
Ragnar Lothbrok.

26:39.520 --> 26:44.800
I know this because
so many have told me
how you killed Earl Haraldson,

26:45.520 --> 26:47.432
and then built
a new kind of ship,

26:47.520 --> 26:52.151
were the first to sail west,
and defeated
a king of England!

26:52.720 --> 26:56.157
In fact,
I can hardly
believe my eyes

26:56.240 --> 26:59.836
that you are
standing right here
in front of me.

26:59.920 --> 27:02.151
Please, please.

27:04.800 --> 27:08.840
Travelers and
storytellers have described
how you came to your throne

27:09.200 --> 27:11.112
by defeating, one by one,

27:11.200 --> 27:12.953
the six uncles that
killed your father.

27:13.040 --> 27:14.394
And my mother,

27:15.240 --> 27:17.471
and all my sisters
and brothers.

27:19.400 --> 27:22.472
I also know how you
favor the poets at your court,

27:23.960 --> 27:28.477
and your people
respect your law making,
your justice and your rule.

27:28.560 --> 27:30.711
And as a consequence, here,

27:31.520 --> 27:33.512
on this site,

27:33.760 --> 27:35.672
in the living presence
of the gods,

27:38.080 --> 27:39.400
I offer you my fealty

27:43.240 --> 27:44.754
and my service.

27:52.600 --> 27:55.638
I accept your pledge
with a glad heart.

27:57.760 --> 27:59.911
What can I do
for you in return?

28:00.280 --> 28:01.270
Hmm.

28:02.400 --> 28:04.551
You could join
forces with me.

28:05.720 --> 28:08.918
I am not satisfied
with what I have
achieved so far.

28:09.880 --> 28:13.396
I want to send
bigger raiding
parties to the west.

28:14.120 --> 28:18.399
Yes, to plunder,
but also to explore
new lands.

28:18.480 --> 28:20.836
There are other
lands to the west?

28:21.000 --> 28:23.196
There is
a kingdom called Francia.

28:23.560 --> 28:26.519
A kingdom far larger,
far richer

28:26.640 --> 28:29.030
and far more
powerful than England.

28:30.120 --> 28:31.679
Athelstan, come.

28:34.520 --> 28:36.113
Come.

28:37.440 --> 28:39.397
This man has seen it.

28:40.400 --> 28:42.631
I was a Christian
monk in England.

28:44.000 --> 28:46.196
I traveled to other
lands as a missionary.

28:47.120 --> 28:51.478
I have heard of Christians
and of their god.

28:52.400 --> 28:55.154
And are you
still a Christian?

28:56.680 --> 28:57.670
No.

28:57.760 --> 28:58.830
Of course not!

28:59.000 --> 29:02.471
How could you be a Christian
and walk among our gods?

29:02.840 --> 29:06.470
I share your appetite
for new adventure,
Ragnar Lothbrok,

29:06.560 --> 29:08.916
and I will gladly
join forces with you,

29:09.040 --> 29:13.990
since, as king, I am
naturally not in favor of
individual enterprise

29:14.160 --> 29:16.755
by my earls or anyone else.

29:18.400 --> 29:22.519
But, believe me, I will be
happy enough just to have
my name linked with yours

29:22.640 --> 29:26.520
when the poets tell the story
of how we Norsemen sailed west

29:26.640 --> 29:28.199
and discovered new worlds.

29:32.720 --> 29:36.031
Please, come. Eat, eat.

29:43.840 --> 29:45.752
Why did you bother
to come back?

29:47.160 --> 29:48.719
I was hungry.

29:54.280 --> 29:56.590
How many women
have you been with?

29:59.040 --> 30:01.635
I don't suppose you know.
I do what I want here.

30:03.040 --> 30:04.918
I thought we
came here together.

30:05.400 --> 30:07.676
We came here with Earl Ragnar.

30:08.160 --> 30:10.436
I thought we came
here together, but...

30:10.560 --> 30:12.870
We did come here together.

30:13.400 --> 30:14.880
We are together.

30:16.840 --> 30:19.150
Why do you keep pestering me?

30:22.040 --> 30:25.238
I am who I am

30:25.920 --> 30:27.400
and I won't change,

30:28.240 --> 30:32.200
not for you,
not for my brother,
not for anyone.

30:35.280 --> 30:37.237
So leave if you want to.

30:41.920 --> 30:45.755
But one day
I will be a great man

30:46.840 --> 30:50.959
and you'll regret leaving me
just because I sleep
with other women.

31:07.440 --> 31:09.750
If you really want
to be a great man,

31:11.560 --> 31:14.314
should you not be meeting
with King Horik now?

31:15.360 --> 31:16.555
What do you mean?

31:16.640 --> 31:18.791
Well, that's where
your brother is now,

31:22.640 --> 31:26.031
and no doubt he's already
boasting about how
he sailed west, alone,

31:26.120 --> 31:29.033
and all he has
achieved alone.

31:31.120 --> 31:33.589
If you weren't so
stubborn and so drunk,

31:33.680 --> 31:35.876
you would be there, too,
but you weren't invited.

31:36.560 --> 31:38.631
You didn't even know about it.

31:40.760 --> 31:42.911
I could have told you.

31:45.440 --> 31:46.669
You see, Rollo,

31:47.560 --> 31:49.995
you need me as
much as I need you.

31:52.520 --> 31:55.831
That is, if you really
want to be something.

32:10.000 --> 32:14.517
Ragnar Lothbrok,
I drink to your good fortune.

32:14.680 --> 32:17.798
May the gods
continue to favor you
and increase your fame.

32:19.040 --> 32:22.351
May they do the same
to you, King Horik.

32:23.360 --> 32:26.353
You have done me the honor
of pledging your
fealty as earl to me.

32:26.600 --> 32:29.354
Forgive me, then,
if I seem anxious

32:29.480 --> 32:32.598
to make use of your
skills and reputation

32:33.520 --> 32:35.079
as soon as possible.

32:38.200 --> 32:39.634
To do what?

32:40.600 --> 32:43.718
There is a Jarl in Götland,
Jarl Borg.

32:44.080 --> 32:47.756
He is an important fellow,
but he continues to claim
he has legal rights

32:47.840 --> 32:49.069
over some of my land.

32:50.040 --> 32:51.190
He threatens me.

32:51.480 --> 32:54.473
He nearly invaded
my territory a year ago,

32:54.560 --> 32:56.631
but at the last moment,
he drew back.

32:56.720 --> 32:57.995
And now, once again,

33:00.560 --> 33:02.438
he is making
threatening noises.

33:07.240 --> 33:12.554
And how can I be of
help in such a matter?

33:14.120 --> 33:18.672
Would you be prepared
to travel to Götland
as my emissary?

33:19.600 --> 33:22.513
I can think of no one
who I would rather
represent my case,

33:22.600 --> 33:25.513
for your fame is widespread.

33:26.480 --> 33:28.233
If the issue is settled,

33:28.600 --> 33:30.990
I shall be forever
in your debt.

33:33.880 --> 33:35.678
What do you say?

34:05.600 --> 34:07.273
Come.

34:56.400 --> 34:58.915
Have you come here
of your own free will?

35:06.360 --> 35:07.714
Yes.

35:10.240 --> 35:12.800
At first,
I was suspicious of you.

35:14.920 --> 35:16.354
I sensed something,

35:16.840 --> 35:19.036
so I spoke
to Lord Ragnar.

35:20.040 --> 35:22.032
He told me your story.

35:23.840 --> 35:25.911
That you were a priest,

35:26.600 --> 35:28.671
that you were a Christian

35:28.880 --> 35:31.554
and worshipped a god
called Jesus Christ.

35:31.920 --> 35:33.274
Is that true?

35:35.400 --> 35:36.754
Yes.

35:38.080 --> 35:40.549
And do you still
worship this god?

35:40.720 --> 35:43.030
Are you still,
in your heart,
a Christian?

35:44.160 --> 35:45.640
No.

35:48.760 --> 35:50.353
Say again.

35:51.840 --> 35:53.274
No.

35:55.320 --> 35:57.232
And a third time,

35:59.560 --> 36:00.914
say it.

36:05.760 --> 36:06.989
No.

36:15.560 --> 36:18.394
You know why you're here,
don't you?

36:20.080 --> 36:23.596
You have been brought here
as a sacrifice to the gods.

36:51.280 --> 36:56.958
I have come to tell you
that the sacrifice of this man
will not please the gods.

36:58.640 --> 37:03.795
He is neither willing
nor is his faith
acceptable to Odin.

37:04.640 --> 37:06.711
His heart is corrupt.

37:07.640 --> 37:11.190
He has not renounced
his false god.

37:14.320 --> 37:16.915
Looks like your god
finally came through for you.

37:20.400 --> 37:24.633
Instead,
one amongst you must agree

37:24.920 --> 37:28.357
to take his place
tomorrow at the sacrifice.

37:28.480 --> 37:31.552
If not, then all shall fail.

37:33.880 --> 37:38.477
The gods, in their anger,
will punish everyone

37:39.000 --> 37:43.438
and withdraw their protection
from all of us.

37:50.560 --> 37:52.438
No, not you.

38:12.560 --> 38:15.359
Before anyone else
can claim this honor,

38:20.560 --> 38:23.029
I desire to be sacrificed.

38:24.080 --> 38:26.037
For the sake of my family,

38:26.760 --> 38:29.400
for the sake of all of you,

38:32.840 --> 38:35.230
my friends.

38:38.080 --> 38:41.596
But even more, for the sake
of all humans in Midgard.

38:43.360 --> 38:47.036
I trust that
the gods will find
my sacrifice acceptable.

38:47.160 --> 38:51.234
In which case, I look
forward to it joyfully.
