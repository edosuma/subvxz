WEBVTT

01:18.995 --> 01:20.121
Joyce?

01:27.587 --> 01:29.339
So you're how many weeks now?

01:29.422 --> 01:30.673
Twenty-six.

01:30.757 --> 01:33.593
Okay, so you're well
into your last trimester. Good.

01:33.676 --> 01:37.597
The moodiness. The nervousness. Hmm?

01:38.890 --> 01:41.684
Look, you want to think of this
as the time where you can relax,

01:41.768 --> 01:45.438
just think about the joy that's about to
enter your lives when this baby comes. Hm?

01:46.689 --> 01:50.193
Now, I see you've been put on lots
of medications. I see some hormones here.

01:50.693 --> 01:52.779
-Which drugs are you currently taking?
-I'm--

01:52.862 --> 01:56.282
That's why we're here today, Doctor.
It's the medications.

01:56.366 --> 01:59.035
She's taking Equanil for anxiety.

01:59.119 --> 02:00.829
That's supposed to be as needed,

02:00.912 --> 02:03.081
but she's gone through
refill after refill.

02:05.041 --> 02:08.294
-Another doctor gave her sleeping pills.
-It's important I sleep.

02:08.378 --> 02:10.755
Laxatives, Valium.
He's given her morphine.

02:10.839 --> 02:12.465
Three times
he's given me morphine.

02:12.549 --> 02:14.217
She's had injections of barbiturates.

02:14.300 --> 02:16.386
If they relax me,
I should be taking them.

02:16.469 --> 02:19.681
My concern is the fetus.

02:20.473 --> 02:22.267
I… I fear for the child.

02:22.350 --> 02:25.603
You know, you hear about all
those thalidomide babies in England.

02:25.687 --> 02:28.273
-I'm not taking thalidomide.
-Don't interrupt me.

02:29.566 --> 02:31.734
You are taking 26 pills a day.

02:31.818 --> 02:34.779
I am taking the pills
that the doctors have given me, Lionel.

02:34.863 --> 02:36.406
I'm doing what they're telling me.

02:36.489 --> 02:39.367
All I want is to feel better,
and I have you angry with me.

02:39.450 --> 02:41.411
Every doctor makes me feel
I'm doing wrong,

02:41.494 --> 02:43.955
and I don't know
what it is that I'm doing wrong.

02:44.038 --> 02:46.666
Okay. Okay.

02:46.749 --> 02:48.293
I understand.

02:48.376 --> 02:51.004
Your hormones are all over the place.
You're confused.

02:51.087 --> 02:53.089
Your world's about to be
turned upside down--

02:53.173 --> 02:54.757
-I don't feel confused.
-Joyce.

02:54.841 --> 02:57.135
I just want to know
what is actually happening.

02:57.844 --> 03:00.722
I mean, chemically,
that would make me feel this way.

03:00.805 --> 03:03.391
I don't want you to worry
about any of that, okay?

03:03.474 --> 03:08.188
All you need to know
is that it's normal and it'll pass.

03:08.688 --> 03:12.650
It would be best if you could try to deal
with it without relying on medication.

03:12.734 --> 03:16.154
I just want this to be over
so I can get on with my life.

03:20.450 --> 03:22.827
Some women actually enjoy pregnancy.

03:24.370 --> 03:25.455
I know that.

03:29.417 --> 03:31.211
I feel so guilty that I don't.

03:32.295 --> 03:34.088
It'll be over soon enough.

04:05.328 --> 04:07.330
-Oh. Oh!

04:07.413 --> 04:10.083
There we go. Got one. Nice, nice, nice.

04:11.584 --> 04:13.503
Here, you take it.

04:16.631 --> 04:18.383
Okay. Okay.

04:19.550 --> 04:23.221
-Dang, it's really small.
-Oh, no, no. A nice size.

04:23.304 --> 04:24.514
We'll eat him.

04:28.017 --> 04:30.478
Okay. All right.

04:30.561 --> 04:34.107
Now I'm gonna show you
how to put a worm on a hook.

04:34.941 --> 04:36.943
Let me get a nice big one here.

04:37.026 --> 04:38.027
Now this…

04:40.780 --> 04:43.825
This is the head,
and you want to keep it wiggling.

04:43.908 --> 04:48.079
So, I have to kinda imagine
where the ass'd be.

04:48.997 --> 04:53.167
And, uh, that's where
you get the hook to penetrate.

04:53.668 --> 04:54.669
Go ahead.

04:56.921 --> 04:58.131
It'll wiggle a little.

05:01.592 --> 05:02.510
Right there?

05:02.593 --> 05:03.594
Yeah.

05:03.678 --> 05:05.263
-"Ow."

05:05.346 --> 05:07.890
Sorry, pal. That's gotta hurt.

05:09.600 --> 05:11.185
I don't know.

05:11.269 --> 05:13.062
Maybe it's, like, a girl worm.

05:13.771 --> 05:15.648
And maybe you're just stickin' it in her.

05:17.734 --> 05:20.653
I'm sure you and your buddies, that's
all you talk about in school, right?

05:20.737 --> 05:21.779
Girls?

05:24.449 --> 05:26.534
-Like that?
-Yeah. Attaboy.

05:26.617 --> 05:30.872
Now just take the head there,
and just wrap it around a couple of times,

05:32.248 --> 05:34.125
and then stick it in the side.

05:36.878 --> 05:37.920
Wow.

05:38.504 --> 05:40.131
Yeah, there you go.

05:40.214 --> 05:42.300
Now, that way, it's alive, but,

05:43.051 --> 05:45.762
you know, it can't fall off,
and the fish can't take it off.

05:47.555 --> 05:49.724
-Well, see what else is out there.
-Okay.

06:04.781 --> 06:06.699
So, you dating any girls at school?

06:10.703 --> 06:12.580
I don't really like any of 'em.

06:12.663 --> 06:14.040
Right. Yeah.

06:18.961 --> 06:20.421
But you know how it works.

06:21.255 --> 06:22.340
Right?

06:23.716 --> 06:27.303
When a man
and a woman, you know, have sex?

06:28.388 --> 06:32.892
I'm sure your friends, you know…
Somebody's got a <i>Playboy </i>in his locker.

06:33.684 --> 06:35.978
We don't have to talk about this, Dad.

06:41.359 --> 06:42.443
And then…

06:44.946 --> 06:46.489
you just lop off the head.

06:54.455 --> 06:55.915
-Like that.
-Mmm.

06:57.708 --> 06:59.335
Oh, can I try mine?

06:59.836 --> 07:01.796
Yeah. Sure. Just be careful.

07:01.879 --> 07:04.590
Knife is really sharp.
Yeah, let me dry it for you.

07:04.674 --> 07:06.092
Don't want it to slip.

07:35.246 --> 07:36.289
Come on.

07:46.382 --> 07:47.383
C'mon.

07:58.644 --> 08:00.563
-I don't understand why--
-What?

08:00.646 --> 08:03.024
-What's wrong with what I did?
-You knew I needed it.

08:03.107 --> 08:05.526
-So?
-You knew that. Jesus Christ!

08:05.610 --> 08:08.237
Why can't I go anywhere?
You never let me go anywhere.

08:08.321 --> 08:10.156
You have an issue with everywhere I go!

08:10.823 --> 08:12.325
What is the matter with you?

08:12.408 --> 08:15.286
What do you mean?
Why is there something the matter with me?

08:15.369 --> 08:17.872
We had a conversation.
I told you I needed the car.

08:17.955 --> 08:22.168
Yeah? Okay, well, I found
something that was really interesting!

08:22.251 --> 08:24.795
-But you never believe me.
-You could've told me before!

08:24.879 --> 08:27.465
-You don't believe anything I do.
-I needed the car.

08:27.548 --> 08:30.176
-You knew that I needed it.
-And you think I'm nuts, yeah.

08:30.259 --> 08:31.427
No, please, stop.

08:31.511 --> 08:34.096
But something happened,
and it was really interesting,

08:34.180 --> 08:36.766
and you think I'm crazy.
You always think I'm crazy.

08:36.849 --> 08:39.018
-Put the fuckin'--
-Don't you call me crazy!

08:39.101 --> 08:41.145
Put down the fucking knife, Joyce!
Put it--!

08:43.481 --> 08:44.899
What's the matter with you?

08:44.982 --> 08:47.360
You can't take the car
and drive wherever you choose.

08:47.443 --> 08:49.070
And there's no fucking UFOs.

08:49.153 --> 08:51.781
The <i>Akron Beacon Journal</i>
wrote an article about it!

08:51.864 --> 08:54.116
-Did they?
-There were lights in the sky!

08:54.200 --> 08:57.203
And I followed it
all the way down Route 14,

08:57.286 --> 08:59.872
so don't tell me that I'm fucking crazy!

08:59.956 --> 09:02.291
Hey! Hey, this is none of your business!

09:02.375 --> 09:03.960
Go do your homework, Jeff!

09:04.043 --> 09:06.837
-Happy? Are you hap--?
-I hate you!

10:21.454 --> 10:23.789
Hey, Dahmer.
Do that thing you did in Spanish class.

10:23.873 --> 10:25.166
It was hilarious.

10:25.666 --> 10:26.834
What?

10:26.917 --> 10:30.129
That guy your mom knows,
who's all… fucked up.

10:33.007 --> 10:36.093
Ah! You should put blue curtains in there!

10:37.887 --> 10:39.680
That's so funny, man.

10:40.556 --> 10:42.767
That's what they call "doin' a Dahmer."

10:42.850 --> 10:44.685
Oh!

10:45.311 --> 10:47.563
No!

10:47.647 --> 10:49.482
-Silence!
-What?

10:49.565 --> 10:52.902
Joyce! Put down the knife, Joyce!

10:53.819 --> 10:55.446
Put it down!

11:00.159 --> 11:00.993
All right.

11:03.079 --> 11:04.038
Peace.

11:04.789 --> 11:06.457
-Later, man.
-"Peace"?

11:11.587 --> 11:17.009
Okay, guys. Just remember,
these scalpels are razor sharp.

11:17.093 --> 11:18.135
Okay?

11:18.219 --> 11:22.264
So when you give it to your partner,
you put it down and let them pick it up.

11:23.140 --> 11:24.058
Denise.

11:24.141 --> 11:25.685
Do we have to do this?

11:25.768 --> 11:26.936
Yes.

11:27.019 --> 11:29.397
Okay, but I'm a vegetarian.

11:29.980 --> 11:32.066
-Fuck you.

11:32.149 --> 11:34.944
Okay, Chazz.
That is enough, thank you.

11:35.027 --> 11:37.863
Yes, this is mandatory.

11:37.947 --> 11:39.365
Anatomy is part of science.

11:39.448 --> 11:42.034
It's how we learn
about the human body, Denise.

11:42.118 --> 11:44.745
And besides,
these pigs are already dead, okay?

11:44.829 --> 11:46.455
Yeah, but they didn't just die.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.457
They got killed so we could dissect them.

11:48.541 --> 11:51.293
Shut up, Denise. We want to do this.

11:51.877 --> 11:53.170
Okay, Jeff, thank you.

11:53.254 --> 11:54.130
That's enough.

11:54.630 --> 11:57.800
All right, guys. Please be very careful.

11:58.718 --> 12:01.011
No trips to the emergency room today.

12:04.890 --> 12:09.937
Good. Now, you may need
to cut through the sternum

12:10.020 --> 12:11.814
in order to expose the chest cavity.

12:11.897 --> 12:13.941
Now, be real careful with that.

12:14.608 --> 12:15.443
Good.

12:15.526 --> 12:18.279
Okay, now let's go ahead
and remove the pericardium.

12:18.362 --> 12:21.657
That is the membrane
surrounding the heart.

12:23.492 --> 12:26.620
No, Jeff, don't take the heart out yet.

12:29.248 --> 12:30.458
Sorry.

12:33.043 --> 12:36.547
Hey, good work today, Jeff.
I could tell you really got into that.

12:37.923 --> 12:39.258
Yeah, I really enjoyed that.

12:39.341 --> 12:40.217
Good.

12:43.304 --> 12:45.055
You think I could take one home?

12:46.182 --> 12:47.516
Just to practice.

12:51.604 --> 12:55.065
Well, to be honest with you, Jeff,
I've been, uh, teaching for 22 years

12:55.149 --> 12:57.276
and no one's ever asked me that. Um…

12:59.111 --> 13:00.154
Sure.

13:01.781 --> 13:02.782
Thanks.

13:09.038 --> 13:13.125
Dude! Wasn't that fun?
Shutting down that fucking bitch, Denise?

13:14.251 --> 13:17.713
Yeah, she's, like,
the fucking worst partner.

13:21.383 --> 13:22.259
Hey, man.

13:23.052 --> 13:24.386
I got another one.

13:24.970 --> 13:26.639
-You want to come over?
-Another what?

13:26.722 --> 13:28.307
Another pig.

13:28.390 --> 13:31.769
Bertoglio gave me one.
Wanna come over and dissect it?

13:34.355 --> 13:36.023
What, are you fucking kidding me?

13:37.233 --> 13:38.234
No.

13:58.712 --> 14:02.967
So, I've reviewed the testimony,
and I've made a decision.

14:03.676 --> 14:08.806
Mr. Dahmer, I understand your concerns
about Mrs. Dahmer's emotional stability.

14:08.889 --> 14:10.558
But you've got to understand

14:10.641 --> 14:14.395
that if you're getting physically violent
with her, even if it's once or twice--

14:14.478 --> 14:15.729
That's not true. It's not true.

14:15.813 --> 14:18.190
And there is a question
of your work as well.

14:18.274 --> 14:20.067
You work very long hours,

14:20.150 --> 14:24.655
and who can actually be there for
these two boys is really what's paramount.

14:25.364 --> 14:30.411
You will retain all visitation rights,
but I hereby award custody to Mrs. Dahmer.

14:30.494 --> 14:31.328
Thank you.

14:31.412 --> 14:34.206
Okay. This is just a first step.
We can appeal, so don't worry.

14:40.254 --> 14:41.964
-David.
-Honey, come on.

14:42.047 --> 14:45.843
David, I'll always be here for you.
If you need me, call, and I'll get you.

14:45.926 --> 14:47.303
Don't talk to him.

14:48.012 --> 14:50.431
So, what do we do about Jeff?

14:50.514 --> 14:53.976
Well, he's 17. He's a man.
He can figure it out for himself.

15:03.694 --> 15:05.112
<i>So you get a sheen!</i>

15:05.779 --> 15:07.489
<i> Lemon refreshed Mr. Clean.</i>

15:08.490 --> 15:10.242
<i>-I'll buy that.</i>
-<i>That's nice.</i>

15:12.161 --> 15:14.288
<i>-Nice nose.</i>
-<i>Thanks.</i>

15:15.414 --> 15:18.292
<i>Carol Knight</i>

15:18.375 --> 15:19.960

15:20.044 --> 15:22.755
<i>and there's no reason</i>

15:22.838 --> 15:26.008

15:34.475 --> 15:35.726
What are you watching?

15:36.727 --> 15:37.895
Oh, hi, Jeff.

15:39.188 --> 15:42.983
Uh, would you turn the TV off and sit?

15:43.067 --> 15:45.110
<i> …it works. Use it regularly.</i>

15:45.194 --> 15:48.238
<i>Head & Shoulders is number one</i>
<i>on the list as far as I'm--</i>

15:55.746 --> 15:57.748
It's been real hard
around here for me.

15:59.667 --> 16:00.834
And, uh…

16:03.212 --> 16:05.130
some things have got to change.

16:06.340 --> 16:11.220
Uh, they have to change
because I can't function like this.

16:21.981 --> 16:22.856
Am I…

16:25.609 --> 16:27.236
I'm gonna stay with you, right?

16:28.195 --> 16:29.780
I get to live with you?

16:31.490 --> 16:33.117
Oh, we'll figure that out.

16:34.952 --> 16:36.203
Mmm.

16:41.959 --> 16:43.127
What's that smell?

16:46.797 --> 16:47.881
Uh…

16:49.508 --> 16:50.843
It's my fetal pig.

16:50.926 --> 16:52.052
Oh!

16:52.136 --> 16:54.138
We're dissecting them in class.

16:54.221 --> 16:56.515
Oh, that's good.

16:59.351 --> 17:00.477
You keep at that.

17:05.649 --> 17:06.900
You're a good boy, Jeff.

17:50.986 --> 17:52.571
Come on, David, let's go!

17:53.572 --> 17:54.531
Hurry up.

17:56.450 --> 17:57.534
What's goin' on?

17:58.118 --> 18:00.079
Ah!

18:00.704 --> 18:03.499
Your father's fucking
that new girlfriend of his at the motel.

18:03.582 --> 18:05.918
Get in the car, David! We're leaving.

18:06.418 --> 18:08.170
-Well--
-I just need to get away.

18:08.253 --> 18:12.591
Get my head together. Okay?
I'm sorry. That's what's happening.

18:13.092 --> 18:15.094
Well, Mom, uh, wait a second.

18:15.177 --> 18:20.224
I… I can't just leave.
I got graduation and… prom.

18:20.307 --> 18:23.102
Ha! What are you talking about?
You're staying here.

18:23.685 --> 18:26.688
I just cooked a big pot of stew,
and there's food in the freezer.

18:29.149 --> 18:30.526
You can't just leave me here.

18:30.609 --> 18:32.236
Cut the shit, Jeff.

18:33.153 --> 18:35.405
You haven't had
a nice word for me in years.

18:35.489 --> 18:36.740
You're always in your room.

18:37.324 --> 18:39.660
You don't want a mother.
You don't want me.

18:39.743 --> 18:43.080
You're just like your father,
bonding over what a lunatic I am.

18:43.622 --> 18:46.125
You never wanted
anything to do with Joyce.

18:46.208 --> 18:47.793
Neither one of you!

18:47.876 --> 18:51.213
So, fine. You got what you wished for.

18:56.260 --> 18:57.886
And did it ever occur to you

18:58.971 --> 19:03.600
that you never once asked me
to help you with one of your projects

19:03.684 --> 19:06.603
out in the garage with the animals
like you did with your father?

19:07.104 --> 19:08.272
Not once.

19:09.731 --> 19:11.150
I didn't think you'd want to.

19:11.233 --> 19:13.861
You're right! It's fucking disgusting!

19:13.944 --> 19:16.572
Cutting up roadkill in the garage!

19:17.072 --> 19:18.157
It's sick!

19:19.158 --> 19:21.577
And it would've been nice
if you'd asked me!

19:23.579 --> 19:24.746
-Mom.

19:24.830 --> 19:26.415
-So that's it, huh?

19:26.498 --> 19:28.000
Well, that's great, Ma.

19:28.083 --> 19:30.919
Just… just go take my brother
and chase UFOs.

19:31.003 --> 19:32.254
They're real!

21:44.469 --> 21:46.221
I don't want you to do that.

21:47.014 --> 21:48.640
Why did you do that?

21:49.474 --> 21:53.645
No. No.

22:02.821 --> 22:05.782
Stop. Stop.

22:05.866 --> 22:07.743
No. No.

22:12.205 --> 22:15.167
No. No.

22:17.044 --> 22:19.254
Okay. Okay. Okay!

22:19.338 --> 22:22.424
I'll get you a beer, jeez. God.

22:25.344 --> 22:26.553
Yeah.

22:35.812 --> 22:36.938
Okay, here you go.

22:39.149 --> 22:40.525
-Cheers.

23:32.828 --> 23:35.080
I can't. I can't.

26:13.989 --> 26:15.031
Mm…

26:16.700 --> 26:18.285
Sorry it's such a mess.

26:21.997 --> 26:25.959
You want a drink or something?
You want a beer?

26:26.585 --> 26:29.004
Yeah, that'd be great.

26:33.925 --> 26:38.471
It's just nice
having some companionship, I mean…

26:40.849 --> 26:43.018
I've been here by myself this whole time.

26:44.185 --> 26:45.395
Yeah?

26:45.478 --> 26:46.438
Yeah.

26:47.522 --> 26:49.524
I haven't heard from my dad and

26:50.400 --> 26:52.944
my mom said she'd be gone
like two weeks, and that was…

26:53.987 --> 26:55.322
three months ago.

26:57.115 --> 26:58.575
I don't know where she is.

27:01.786 --> 27:03.204
That's tough, man.

27:05.790 --> 27:06.750
Yeah.

27:08.376 --> 27:09.836
Well, you're here now.

27:11.588 --> 27:12.672
So it's better.

27:24.309 --> 27:25.268
Cheers.

27:42.535 --> 27:46.831
<i>I've always found</i>
<i>that if I can occupy my hands,</i>

27:47.332 --> 27:50.919
my anxieties just melt away.

27:51.002 --> 27:56.132
I'm not obsessing over my failures,

27:56.925 --> 27:58.760
my disappointments.

27:59.928 --> 28:04.849
I'm just taking my life
one little knot at a time.

28:06.101 --> 28:08.561
Joyce? Just a minute.

28:08.645 --> 28:11.231
Sure. Uh, excuse me.

28:11.898 --> 28:15.026
<i>I know we helped you</i>
<i>through a really tough time, Joyce,</i>

28:15.110 --> 28:18.321
and I'm so appreciative
you're willing to come back here now

28:18.405 --> 28:19.906
and help other women.

28:19.989 --> 28:22.033
I wish everyone did that.

28:22.117 --> 28:25.745
Well, mostly,
these ladies want to be heard.

28:26.663 --> 28:29.541
I think that's
what it was about for me too.

28:30.208 --> 28:34.045
And then I walked in here,
and someone listened to me

28:34.129 --> 28:38.174
for the very first time
in my life, and I thought,

28:39.175 --> 28:42.387
"My God, I'm not crazy."

28:42.887 --> 28:45.181
Of course you're not crazy.

28:46.975 --> 28:49.269
You had a medical condition, Joyce.

28:49.352 --> 28:50.812
I'm sure of it.

28:50.895 --> 28:53.064
It's called postpartum depression.

28:53.857 --> 28:56.109
-Really.
-I'm positive.

28:56.192 --> 28:58.695
We just didn't know what it was back then.

28:58.778 --> 29:00.613
It can last for years.

29:00.697 --> 29:04.367
Postpartum. Never even occurred to me.

29:06.119 --> 29:09.998
Joyce, your classes, the arts and crafts,

29:10.498 --> 29:13.251
they are a godsend to these women.

29:13.334 --> 29:16.629
No, Joyce, they are.

29:17.422 --> 29:19.966
Which is what I wanted
to talk to you about.

29:21.009 --> 29:22.927
I'm leaving here.

29:23.011 --> 29:24.971
Simon got transferred to Grand Rapids,

29:25.054 --> 29:29.058
and I got a job
counseling women at a clinic there.

29:30.101 --> 29:32.729
I want you to take over for me here.

29:32.812 --> 29:36.524
It could be part-time.
Even two, three days a week.

29:37.317 --> 29:38.526
Oh, Dottie.

29:41.780 --> 29:43.406
I don't know what to say.

29:45.450 --> 29:47.160
I'm very flattered.

29:50.580 --> 29:51.623
But it's…

29:52.832 --> 29:55.293
Since it's over between Lionel and I…

29:58.087 --> 29:59.589
Oh, sweetheart.

30:00.089 --> 30:01.257
No, no, it's not that.

30:05.053 --> 30:07.680
It's just, I've been
thinking so much lately

30:09.057 --> 30:12.143
about how I'd do
my life over again if I could.

30:16.314 --> 30:18.608
I don't think
I would have married so young.

30:21.778 --> 30:23.738
I would have waited to have kids.

30:26.658 --> 30:27.951
I'd have a career.

30:30.537 --> 30:32.705
What kind of career, do you think?

30:32.789 --> 30:34.082
Well, that's just the thing.

30:37.085 --> 30:39.712
I'd want the job you just offered me.

30:41.923 --> 30:43.299
Of course I'll do it.

30:44.092 --> 30:45.927
Two, three days.

30:46.010 --> 30:48.221
Yes, I'll make it work!

30:51.558 --> 30:55.186
You should be writing
this down. This will be on the exam.

30:55.270 --> 30:58.815
So, next is the different types
of ranges, which…

31:00.567 --> 31:01.860
You're late.

31:05.405 --> 31:09.033
Okay. So, one standard deviation is what?

31:09.117 --> 31:10.994
34.1 in either direction.

31:13.830 --> 31:15.540
Jeff, are you drinking a beer?

31:19.752 --> 31:22.171
Jeff, this is your senior year,

31:22.255 --> 31:25.717
so now is the time
to be thinking about colleges.

31:26.217 --> 31:28.261
If you thought
that was where you were headed.

31:31.097 --> 31:34.559
Jeff, I know your family's
been going through a tough divorce,

31:34.642 --> 31:37.437
and that'd be hard on anybody,

31:37.520 --> 31:39.689
but I know your father
is out of the house now

31:39.772 --> 31:41.316
and that you were very close to him.

31:42.275 --> 31:46.029
I've tried several times to call him.
Guess he's at a hotel.

31:46.654 --> 31:48.656
I've also tried to phone your mother.

31:49.282 --> 31:52.327
Right. She's out a lot.

31:53.202 --> 31:55.163
Well, what do you love to do?

31:55.246 --> 31:58.249
What's your dream?
I wanna know what your dream is.

32:01.711 --> 32:02.712
Um…

32:04.505 --> 32:06.758
Dad always said
I was good at science stuff.

32:08.092 --> 32:12.013
And I got, like,
a taxidermy station in the garage,

32:12.096 --> 32:14.974
where I can dissect roadkill and whatnot.

32:16.142 --> 32:20.605
Okay. Well, um, maybe
that's a career path you could take.

32:22.190 --> 32:23.816
Yeah, I thought about that.

32:24.609 --> 32:28.321
But, uh, I'm not any good at math.

32:29.530 --> 32:30.490
So…

32:35.620 --> 32:40.541
But I… my new hobby
is kind of exploring physical fitness.

32:40.625 --> 32:43.419
Great. Maybe that's
a direction for you to go in.

32:43.503 --> 32:44.629
Yeah.

32:45.213 --> 32:47.757
But it's not my dream, you know.

32:51.219 --> 32:53.304
I think that's just something people say.

32:54.764 --> 32:59.102
Like, I don't think everybody
gets to have a dream.

33:02.188 --> 33:03.940
At least not people like me.

33:05.858 --> 33:08.027
Well, what do you mean?

33:08.861 --> 33:10.321
People like you?

33:17.620 --> 33:19.288
<i>Here's the fourth-biggest hit</i>

33:19.372 --> 33:20.665
<i>in the USA this week.</i>

33:20.748 --> 33:23.626
<i>Suzi Quatro and Chris Norman</i>
<i>with "Stumblin' In."</i>

33:51.487 --> 33:52.947
-Hey, man.
Hey.

33:53.031 --> 33:54.782
Uh, can I get a lift?

33:54.866 --> 33:57.243
I'm trying to get to a concert
in Chippewa Lake Park.

33:57.326 --> 33:58.578
Are you headed that way?

34:00.788 --> 34:01.789
I could be.

34:03.041 --> 34:04.083
What's the concert?

34:04.167 --> 34:05.460
You know Pegasus?

34:06.377 --> 34:08.713
-Yeah.
-Me and some buddies are meeting up there.

34:08.796 --> 34:10.798
I'm like a big Bruce Fulper fan.

34:10.882 --> 34:14.218
I heard they were playin',
and I was like, "Fuck it, I'll hitchhike."

34:16.512 --> 34:17.346
Cool.

34:18.306 --> 34:20.016
What time you gotta be there?

34:20.099 --> 34:21.392
Show's at 7:30.

34:33.237 --> 34:34.363
How about this?

34:35.156 --> 34:37.867
I was just headed home
to crack open a few brewskis.

34:39.535 --> 34:40.995
How about you come with me?

34:41.996 --> 34:45.208
I got some weed. And drink a few beers.

34:46.667 --> 34:47.877
Lift some weights.

34:50.421 --> 34:53.174
And then, uh, I'll drive you out there.

34:54.592 --> 34:56.260
Yeah, man, that sounds great.

35:04.018 --> 35:04.977
What's your name?

35:06.854 --> 35:07.855
Jeff.

35:08.356 --> 35:09.690
Nice to meet you, Jeff.

35:10.399 --> 35:11.818
I'm Steven.

35:27.333 --> 35:29.669
-Yeah, man.

35:29.752 --> 35:31.838
It's like everybody's
into working out all of a sudden.

35:31.921 --> 35:34.966
You know, suddenly,
uh, everybody's jogging.

35:35.466 --> 35:38.136
That ain't gonna cut it
for skinny guys like us, you know?

35:39.595 --> 35:41.722
We gotta lift weights.

35:41.806 --> 35:44.433
Or, like,
chicks ain't even gonna notice us.

35:45.184 --> 35:47.311
-Yeah, exactly.
-That's right.

35:48.646 --> 35:49.856
Jeez.

35:51.524 --> 35:53.693
One more. One more. Yeah. Come on.

35:58.447 --> 36:00.241
Yeah. Nice.

36:00.950 --> 36:03.369
You are fuckin' strong, man.

36:04.662 --> 36:06.956
Yeah, well, I've been workin' out a lot.

36:07.039 --> 36:07.957
I could tell.

36:09.917 --> 36:12.420
-You try it, dude. I'll spot you.
-No. No, no.

36:12.503 --> 36:14.255
-Come on.
-I'm all right. I'm all right.

36:14.338 --> 36:16.549
I… What time is it?

36:18.050 --> 36:19.844
I feel like we should get movin'.

36:22.054 --> 36:24.223
No. We got time.

36:25.308 --> 36:27.435
You want another beer?
We'll have one more beer.

36:27.518 --> 36:28.728
I just…

36:29.312 --> 36:31.063
I'm meeting my buddies there
at, like, seven.

36:31.147 --> 36:32.523
It's like

36:32.607 --> 36:34.525
at least an hour away, right?

36:35.651 --> 36:39.822
Okay, just… we'll have another beer.
We'll get goin' soon.

36:39.906 --> 36:40.907
Okay.

36:44.660 --> 36:46.871
Or, you know,
maybe we could have it on the way.

36:50.291 --> 36:52.251
I just don't want
to miss the concert, you know.

36:52.335 --> 36:54.378
Like, it's Pegasus, man!

36:57.715 --> 36:59.467
You worry too much, jeez.

37:09.518 --> 37:10.603
What the f--?

37:13.564 --> 37:15.191
-What?
-What the--? I mean…

37:16.317 --> 37:17.735
-What?
-Why'd you do that?

37:19.445 --> 37:20.947
I was just joking.

37:21.030 --> 37:22.615
'Cause I'm not that way, man.

37:22.698 --> 37:26.869
Neither am I.
I was just jokin' around. Just sit down.

37:26.953 --> 37:29.205
Are you gonna take me
to the concert or not?

37:29.288 --> 37:30.957
Because you said you would.

37:31.582 --> 37:34.835
Yeah, I will.
Just sit down and have a drink first.

37:34.919 --> 37:37.255
No, man. Let's go.

37:37.755 --> 37:40.216
No. Hey, I don't want to go yet.

37:40.299 --> 37:43.010
Let's… Let's do ten more reps.

37:43.094 --> 37:45.137
I'll put two 25s on. What do you think?

37:45.221 --> 37:49.016
Listen, man, you told me
you would drive me to the concert, okay?

37:49.100 --> 37:52.228
I don't know what you wanted,
but that's what I want.

37:52.311 --> 37:54.480
I want you to drive me there right now.

37:58.651 --> 38:00.152
But I don't want you to go.

38:03.864 --> 38:05.241
Are you fucking crying?

38:06.617 --> 38:08.911
-No.
-What the fuck? Jesus.

38:08.995 --> 38:10.997
I'm… I'm outta here, man.

38:11.497 --> 38:13.374
I'm gonna miss the fucking show now!

38:13.457 --> 38:15.084
-Fucking asshole faggot!

38:15.584 --> 38:16.669
Goddammit.

38:57.710 --> 38:58.586
Hey, man.

39:11.474 --> 39:12.391
Hey, man.

39:13.559 --> 39:15.394
-Stop playing around.

39:15.478 --> 39:16.771
What are you doin'? Ow. Fuck.

39:16.854 --> 39:18.022
Hey, stop!

39:18.606 --> 39:20.024
Fuck you.

39:20.107 --> 39:22.193
Hey. Hey!

39:23.611 --> 39:24.987
Stop.

39:54.809 --> 39:56.477
Oh, fuck.

40:04.985 --> 40:06.070
Oh…

40:13.577 --> 40:14.453
Hey.

40:16.872 --> 40:19.291
What are you doing?

40:21.502 --> 40:22.586
Stop.

40:36.809 --> 40:38.394
Come on, man. Let's go.

40:43.774 --> 40:47.194
Hey. Hey, wake up. Wake up!

40:48.696 --> 40:52.324
No, no, no, no, no. No. No.

40:53.909 --> 40:55.035
No.

40:55.786 --> 40:56.996
Oh my God.

40:57.496 --> 40:59.915
No, no, no, no. Oh my God.

40:59.999 --> 41:03.085
No. No, no, no, no.

41:03.586 --> 41:05.004
Oh, no.

41:05.838 --> 41:07.006
No!

41:07.089 --> 41:09.133
They're never gonna talk to me again.

41:09.216 --> 41:10.468
My family.

41:10.551 --> 41:13.137
You idiot! You fucking idiot!

41:13.220 --> 41:14.472
-No.

41:14.555 --> 41:16.056
Hey, come on.

41:16.140 --> 41:17.391
Come on, wake up.

41:18.017 --> 41:19.059
Wake up.

41:19.143 --> 41:19.977
Fuck!

41:22.938 --> 41:24.273
No!

42:23.541 --> 42:24.500
Fuck.

42:41.016 --> 42:42.226
Oh, shit.

42:44.853 --> 42:46.272
Oh, fuck.

42:48.065 --> 42:49.775
Oh, shit.

45:33.689 --> 45:36.316
Look at this guy.
Swerving all over the place.

46:14.980 --> 46:16.732
Can I see your driver's license?

46:18.150 --> 46:19.234
Sure.

46:26.492 --> 46:27.993
Know why I pulled you over?

46:29.912 --> 46:30.954
No.

46:31.038 --> 46:33.248
Because you were
swerving across the road.

46:34.583 --> 46:37.878
And I can smell from here
that you've been drinking, okay?

46:38.670 --> 46:39.922
You been drinking tonight?

46:40.005 --> 46:43.258
Oh, I just had a couple beers.

46:43.342 --> 46:45.719
You had more
than a couple of beers, okay?

46:46.428 --> 46:48.096
What's in the garbage bags?

46:52.434 --> 46:53.602
Uh…

46:54.853 --> 46:59.191
They're, uh… clippings. From the yard.

47:02.194 --> 47:06.240
My parents just got divorced,
and I… I can't really sleep.

47:06.323 --> 47:07.407
So, I, um…

47:08.367 --> 47:10.327
just do yard work, and I, um…

47:11.954 --> 47:15.499
I was gonna… drop 'em at the dump.

47:17.376 --> 47:18.877
You're 18. Is that right?

47:20.045 --> 47:20.921
Yeah.

47:21.004 --> 47:23.382
So you got your whole life ahead of you.

47:27.135 --> 47:30.722
And I'm not gonna fuck that up
by arresting you tonight, okay?

47:33.892 --> 47:34.852
Okay.

47:35.602 --> 47:37.855
But I want you
to turn this car around,

47:37.938 --> 47:39.189
drive your ass home.

47:39.940 --> 47:42.776
And I don't want to ever fucking
see your face again, okay?

47:45.195 --> 47:46.488
Yes, Officer.

47:47.906 --> 47:48.949
Thank you.

47:50.742 --> 47:52.202
Get the fuck outta here.

47:54.204 --> 47:55.163
Okay.
