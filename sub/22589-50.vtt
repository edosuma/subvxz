<i>NARRATOR".
When last we saw the Dynamic Duo...</i>

00:12.263 --> 00:15.600
<i>...they were bound hand and foot
in an outsized coffee cup...</i>

00:15.767 --> 00:19.354
...and <i>about to be scalded and scarred
by sulfuric acid...</i>

00:19.521 --> 00:23.483
...in <i>full view of an unwitting throng
in Chimes Square.</i>

00:23.650 --> 00:28.071
<i>Hold onto your beanies.
They may not get out of this one.</i>

01:37.807 --> 01:38.850
Goodbye, Batman.

01:39.017 --> 01:41.603
-It's been nice working with you.
-Never say die, Robin.

01:41.769 --> 01:45.189
- We've been in worse scrapes than this before.
-Well, not like this.

01:45.356 --> 01:50.486
The acid is about to pour. Quickly,
plaster yourself against the side of the cup.

01:50.653 --> 01:52.363
What are you going to do?

01:52.530 --> 01:56.242
A little trickle of acid will proceed
the big gush, Robin.

01:56.409 --> 01:59.412
If my timing and positioning are accurate...

01:59.621 --> 02:02.707
...perhaps those few drops
will burn through these ropes.

02:03.082 --> 02:05.835
It's about to trickle over the lip, Robin.

02:06.002 --> 02:08.920
But there's many a slip twixt
the cup and lip, Batman.

02:09.088 --> 02:11.257
- Very good, Robin.
-Thank you, Batman.

02:14.844 --> 02:17.555
- Ah!
-You did it.

02:17.722 --> 02:20.642
We're not out of the woods yet, old chum.

02:22.935 --> 02:25.396
I'll have to trip that switch with my Batarang.

02:34.072 --> 02:35.782
I don't know how we do it, Batman.

02:36.282 --> 02:37.700
What do you mean?

02:37.867 --> 02:41.204
The way we get into these scrapes,
and get out of them...

02:41.371 --> 02:45.458
...it's almost as though
someone was dreaming up these situations.

02:45.625 --> 02:47.960
Guiding our destiny.

02:49.003 --> 02:53.841
Things like that only happen in the movies,
Robin. This is real life.

02:54.008 --> 02:56.010
I guess you're right.

02:56.177 --> 02:59.222
- Let's go.
-After Catwoman?

02:59.764 --> 03:03.976
No. Those poor misguided students
are still restless.

03:04.143 --> 03:07.313
Our first duty is to save them.

03:07.772 --> 03:11.359
To disperse them before they do something
that might blight their lives.

03:11.526 --> 03:13.277
Catwoman will have to wait.

03:14.862 --> 03:17.824
<i>NARRATOR".
Meanwhile, in a building across town...</i>

03:17.990 --> 03:22.537
<i>...the annual sale of priceless
Batagonian cat's-eyes opals...</i>

03:22.704 --> 03:26.749
...is <i>about to begin
at the Forever Jewel Company.</i>

03:26.958 --> 03:29.961
Now, ladies and gentlemen...

03:30.128 --> 03:37.009
...as you know, each of these pouches contains
$650,000 worth of cat's-eye opals.

03:37.176 --> 03:41.764
However, because this is the only place
in the world where you can buy them...

03:41.931 --> 03:45.601
...we'll start the bidding at $750,000.

03:45.768 --> 03:48.020
You're not allowed to look in the pouches.

03:48.187 --> 03:52.567
Now, gentlemen, lady, what am I bid?

03:52.942 --> 03:56.154
I'll give you absolutely nothing
for the entire lot.

03:56.320 --> 03:57.488
What?

03:57.655 --> 03:58.656
Who are you?

03:58.823 --> 04:04.120
I'm a Batagonian cat's-eye opal fancier
and I think your prices are outrageous.

04:04.287 --> 04:09.250
Consequently, I shall take them
off your lily-white hands for free.

04:09.417 --> 04:10.918
You're Catwoman.

04:11.335 --> 04:13.504
In the fur.

04:13.796 --> 04:16.298
Now, if you'll all assume positions
of subservience...

04:16.466 --> 04:21.053
...we can complete this caper
with a minimum of jeopardy and danger for all.

04:21.262 --> 04:23.181
On your knees, knaves.

04:25.767 --> 04:27.310
Penn...

04:27.477 --> 04:29.937
...pack up those baubles in your old kit bag.

04:35.109 --> 04:37.570
- Right, commissioner.
-What's up?

04:37.737 --> 04:43.075
Catwoman made off with $12 million worth
of Batagonian cat's-eye opals late last night.

04:43.242 --> 04:45.161
Holy bijou.

04:45.369 --> 04:47.997
That's very good, Robin. Bijou.
French for "jewel."

04:48.164 --> 04:50.041
Heh. Thank you, Batman.

04:50.208 --> 04:53.961
She's playing right into our hands.
I planned it all this way.

04:54.128 --> 04:56.088
You mean you wanted her to steal the gems?

04:56.255 --> 05:01.093
Yes. Batagonian cat's-eye opals are notorious
for the amount of great bad luck they bring...

05:01.260 --> 05:03.471
...to whoever steals them.

05:03.638 --> 05:08.309
I wonder if that amusing old wives' tale
will hold true to form?

05:08.476 --> 05:11.854
You, of all people,
don't believe in superstition, do you?

05:12.021 --> 05:16.025
Me? Superstitious? Nonsense. Ah!

05:17.985 --> 05:20.404
Never walk under a ladder, Robin.

05:20.571 --> 05:22.573
Batman, I'm surprised at you.

05:22.740 --> 05:26.285
Not at all. There is a custom based on fact.

05:26.452 --> 05:29.163
The ladder could fall
and hit you on the head.

05:29.330 --> 05:32.041
Or someone could slip
and fall from the ladder.

05:32.208 --> 05:36.879
It doesn't pay to court disaster, Robin.
Let's go.

05:46.138 --> 05:48.891
Ah! Long time, no meow, Catwoman.

05:49.100 --> 05:51.102
- Where have you been?
-Up the river.

05:51.269 --> 05:54.480
Ah, those are the pitfalls
of the crime business.

05:54.689 --> 05:56.607
Well, what can I do for you?

05:56.816 --> 06:00.736
Judging from the looks of the place,
I take it you're still in the fencing game?

06:00.903 --> 06:04.198
Well, you know I like to keep
my skilled hands in stolen goods.

06:04.365 --> 06:07.577
- Ha.
-Ha-ha-ha. You have something?

06:07.743 --> 06:09.370
Right up your alley.

06:13.499 --> 06:15.084
Ah!

06:16.460 --> 06:18.462
Spaghetti.

06:21.299 --> 06:23.050
Al Dente.

06:23.843 --> 06:27.054
A masterpiece. Sit down.

06:32.143 --> 06:33.227
Ah.

06:33.394 --> 06:38.482
I wish I could invite you to dine with me,
but there is barely enough for one.

06:39.442 --> 06:41.277
I'm sorry.

06:50.286 --> 06:52.413
Batagonian cat's-eye opals.

06:53.122 --> 06:55.875
You said a triple soupgon.

06:58.252 --> 07:00.046
Forget it.

07:00.338 --> 07:01.339
Forget it?

07:01.505 --> 07:05.301
Every gendarme in Gotham City
is looking for these.

07:05.843 --> 07:09.305
- It would be impossible to get rid of.
-You got the best overseas contacts.

07:09.472 --> 07:13.267
It doesn't matter.
There is a $3 million reward for these.

07:14.018 --> 07:15.728
You won't touch them.

07:15.895 --> 07:18.356
No. It's too hot.

07:18.522 --> 07:21.609
Besides, everyone knows
that the Batagonian cat's-eye opals...

07:21.776 --> 07:24.111
...are bad luck for anyone who steals them.

07:27.073 --> 07:30.201
French Freddy, you are a fink.

07:30.409 --> 07:34.872
I wish I could help you, mon cheri,
but you know how it is. Ha, ha.

07:36.832 --> 07:41.379
Well, here's my address.
If you think of something...

07:43.214 --> 07:45.967
<i>- I'll</i> cut you in.
- Thank you.

07:47.593 --> 07:49.053
Come on, gang.

07:50.179 --> 07:52.848
- Ciao.
-Ciao.

07:55.518 --> 07:59.230
Go ahead, Captain Courageous,
tell him what you just told me.

08:01.816 --> 08:05.820
I'm very sorry, Batman,
for ever having doubted you.

08:06.028 --> 08:09.657
That's quite all right, captain.
You were only doing your job, and quite well.

08:09.824 --> 08:12.493
You couldn't have possibly known
it was a Catwoman trick.

08:12.660 --> 08:15.329
Excuse me for a moment,
but I have to phone Bruce Wayne.

08:15.496 --> 08:19.291
Keep him posted on Catwoman's exploits.
He's her parole officer, you know.

08:19.458 --> 08:22.086
Yes, of course, commissioner.
While you make that call...

08:22.253 --> 08:24.547
...I'll borrow the Batphone.
-Good.

08:28.718 --> 08:30.344
What are you going to do?

08:30.511 --> 08:34.432
I've provided for emergencies like this,
Robin.

08:34.597 --> 08:36.892
Now, you just watch.

08:42.690 --> 08:45.609
- I'm afraid he's not here, sir.
-No, I'm here.

08:46.402 --> 08:47.528
Good gracious me.

08:47.695 --> 08:50.656
<i>The Wayne phone will ring
in a few seconds, Alfred.</i>

08:50.823 --> 08:55.661
- Plug in the Bat-syllable device.
-Right, sir.

09:10.384 --> 09:13.721
Hello.
- This is Commissioner Gordon, Mr. Wayne.

09:13.888 --> 09:15.473
How are you?

09:15.639 --> 09:19.935
I'm calling to let you know that Catwoman's
stolen several million dollar's worth of jewels.

09:20.728 --> 09:23.397
<i>Have you called Batman?</i>

09:23.856 --> 09:26.108
He's here in my office right now.

09:26.275 --> 09:30.404
<i>Good. He'll catch her if anyone can.</i>

09:30.863 --> 09:34.950
<i>Sorry I wasn't a better parole officer.</i>

09:35.117 --> 09:41.248
<i>Call me if you have any further news.
Goodbye.</i>

09:41.457 --> 09:43.417
Goodbye, Mr. Wayne.

09:44.543 --> 09:45.586
Ah.

09:45.753 --> 09:48.380
It's eerie, Batman.
Every time I talk to Mr. Wayne...

09:48.547 --> 09:51.217
...I get the feeling I'm talking to you.
-Really?

09:51.383 --> 09:54.261
For a while I thought
you and he were the same person.

09:54.428 --> 09:57.598
But here you are
and I've just spoken with him on the phone.

09:57.807 --> 10:01.435
I guess that dissolves any tentative theory
I may have harbored.

10:01.602 --> 10:05.564
Sure and it does.
Bruce Wayne is a millionaire playboy.

10:05.731 --> 10:08.651
Hardly a secret identity for Batman.
Ha, ha.

10:08.818 --> 10:10.194
How did it work, sir'?

10:10.361 --> 10:12.404
Superbly.

10:12.613 --> 10:15.574
Now, if you will program
the Well-Known Criminals File...

10:15.741 --> 10:18.702
...and see who in Gotham City
would be the most logical fence...

10:18.869 --> 10:23.124
...to handle a Batagonian
cat's-eye opal heist.

10:23.290 --> 10:26.293
Batagonian-- Yes.

10:38.889 --> 10:42.852
There's only one name listed, sir.
"French Freddy Touche."

10:43.018 --> 10:45.062
<i>- Corbin Place.</i>
- Thank you.

10:45.229 --> 10:48.065
- A lead?
- Yes, I hope so. For all our sakes.

10:48.566 --> 10:50.317
Let's go, Robin.

10:52.695 --> 10:56.240
I'd heard about them out in California,
Commissioner Gordon.

10:56.407 --> 11:00.411
But the idea of crime fighters
in such fantastic costumes...

11:00.578 --> 11:03.372
...seemed too incredible to believe.

11:03.581 --> 11:06.333
We never had anything like that
in Hollywood.

11:06.500 --> 11:09.420
No one will ever see the likes of them again.

11:09.587 --> 11:13.382
For some reason, they chose Gotham City
to be the recipient of their derring-do...

11:13.549 --> 11:17.636
...and I, for one, bless the day
they arrived on the scene.

11:17.845 --> 11:20.681
Long may they live.

11:28.272 --> 11:31.150
Did you come for anything specific, Batman?

11:31.317 --> 11:34.278
Or do you hope to pick up
free pointers on fencing?

11:34.820 --> 11:39.491
Holy Zorro. Don't you know
Batman is the best fencer in the country?

11:50.711 --> 11:55.549
You're still in the stolen-goods business,
aren't you, Freddy?

11:55.716 --> 11:58.302
Me? A fence?

11:58.469 --> 11:59.762
En garde. Catch.

12:01.347 --> 12:05.559
You stain my name, French Freddy Touché.

12:09.647 --> 12:10.981
En garde, I say.

12:17.446 --> 12:20.074
- You were saying?
-Has anyone been here trying to sell...

12:20.241 --> 12:24.578
...a treasure-trove of cat's-eye opals?
-I do not accept stolen merchandise anymore.

12:24.745 --> 12:29.375
Now I am only interested in body-building.

12:31.126 --> 12:34.129
You know, in building bodies.

12:34.338 --> 12:36.006
Can't you see he's stalling, Batman?

12:36.173 --> 12:39.134
A man is innocent until proven guilty, Robin.

12:39.301 --> 12:43.305
That's provided for in our Constitution.
I'll accept your explanation for the nonce.

12:44.265 --> 12:47.810
However, if we find
that you've been prevaricating...

12:48.018 --> 12:51.105
...it will not go well for you.

12:51.522 --> 12:52.523
Let's go, Robin.

13:04.535 --> 13:08.497
Hi, Big Blanche,
I've got a deal for you that'll--

13:11.583 --> 13:14.128
Same to you, lady.

13:14.837 --> 13:16.755
Drat, drat...

13:17.047 --> 13:19.133
...double drat.

13:19.300 --> 13:21.510
Nobody wants the stuff?

13:22.136 --> 13:24.179
Can't give it away.

13:26.515 --> 13:28.809
- Someone's at the secret door.
-Who could it be?

13:28.976 --> 13:31.812
Just one other person knows
about that secret entrance.

13:31.979 --> 13:35.774
French Freddy, the Fence. Let him in.

13:43.866 --> 13:45.200
Bonjour, Catwoman.

13:45.909 --> 13:47.244
Ready to make a deal?

13:47.453 --> 13:54.084
No, no. I just wanted to tell you that Batman
was, uh, how do you say, nosing around.

13:54.251 --> 13:56.295
Batman? We thought he was dead.

13:56.462 --> 13:58.172
He looks pretty good for a dead man.

13:59.298 --> 14:00.466
Triple drat.

14:00.632 --> 14:03.385
I have an idea that will take us all
off the hook.

14:03.552 --> 14:06.597
I know that you cannot sell those opals...

14:06.805 --> 14:10.893
...so I thought it would be a good idea
to turn them in for the reward.

14:11.393 --> 14:14.229
- What's your cut?
-One-third.

14:15.189 --> 14:18.233
One million. That leaves us <i>2</i> million.

14:18.400 --> 14:21.570
Well, that's fair enough.
Give him the opals, boys.

14:21.737 --> 14:23.947
But, Catwoman,
how do we know we can trust him?

14:24.406 --> 14:25.949
We've got no choice.

14:37.211 --> 14:38.921
Thank you.

14:41.799 --> 14:43.759
Excuse me.

14:51.683 --> 14:52.768
What's so funny?

14:52.935 --> 14:55.270
- How you've been taken.
-Taken?

14:55.479 --> 14:58.023
These are not the cat's-eye opals.

14:58.190 --> 15:03.529
- They are cleverly disguised paste replicas.
-We stole them with our own eight hands.

15:03.695 --> 15:06.240
Well, then you went to a lot of trouble
for nothing.

15:06.407 --> 15:12.704
These are imitation zircons
that have been dipped in cherry frosting.

15:13.122 --> 15:16.542
And a poor grade of cherry frosting at that.
Terrible.

15:16.708 --> 15:18.168
Taste.

15:24.883 --> 15:28.470
Batman did it. That dirty, rotten guy.

15:30.013 --> 15:34.017
I'll get him
if it's the second-to-last thing I do.

15:42.234 --> 15:43.694
Brown...

15:43.861 --> 15:47.030
...I want you to take this message
to police headquarters.

15:47.197 --> 15:50.951
Batman's pulled the fur over my eyes
once too often.

15:52.536 --> 15:56.206
Amazing that you could have predicted
her plot, Batman.

15:56.373 --> 16:01.086
You saved the entire nation of Batagonia
with your brilliant foresight.

16:01.253 --> 16:03.672
To say nothing of my profitable business.

16:03.839 --> 16:08.135
The $3 million reward you've posted
will flush her into the open, Miss Forever.

16:08.302 --> 16:10.345
How did you ever do it?

16:10.512 --> 16:14.808
When I learned that the student disturbance
would be in the area of the gem exchange...

16:14.975 --> 16:19.771
...I simply put three and one together
and came up with the answer.

16:19.980 --> 16:22.649
Hence, the switching of the gems.

16:22.816 --> 16:27.029
But by this time, she must have found out
that we've hoodwinked her.

16:27.196 --> 16:32.201
Commissioner, within next few minutes,
you can expect a message from Catwoman.

16:32.409 --> 16:34.453
Holy hypotheses.

16:36.747 --> 16:38.415
Yes, Bonnie.

16:39.166 --> 16:41.043
Send him in.

16:41.710 --> 16:43.670
What brazen impudence.

16:43.837 --> 16:47.549
She sent one of her men here
with a message for you, Batman.

16:51.845 --> 16:54.389
Calm down, Brown. You're as jumpy as a cat.

16:54.556 --> 16:58.018
A message for you, Batman,
from my boss-lady.

17:00.521 --> 17:05.442
"To Batman.
Knowing what sort of a sport you are...

17:05.608 --> 17:10.280
...I realize you will release Brown
to bring your answer back to me.

17:10.446 --> 17:12.491
Here is my proposition.

17:12.657 --> 17:17.204
I'm willing to give myself up,
but only to you, Batman.

17:17.371 --> 17:19.289
Meet me at midnight in the model house...

17:19.455 --> 17:23.210
...at the Sherlock Holmes Real Estate
Development in Suburban, Norchester.

17:23.377 --> 17:30.092
I promise to come alone if you do the same.
Yours truly, Catwoman."

17:31.760 --> 17:36.682
You can tell your mistress
that I will agree to her terms.

17:36.890 --> 17:38.475
Right.

17:41.728 --> 17:43.730
-It's a trick.
-She'll try and kill you.

17:43.897 --> 17:45.732
A bargain is a bargain, Robin.

17:46.233 --> 17:49.695
I must give her the benefit of a doubt.
She said that she'd be there alone.

17:49.861 --> 17:52.698
But she's never told the truth in the past.

17:53.031 --> 17:55.367
Hope springs eternal.

17:57.744 --> 18:02.082
<i>NARRATOR". it is midnight at the Sherlock
Holmes Real Estate Development.</i>

18:09.506 --> 18:12.092
Hello, Batman.

18:12.301 --> 18:15.846
You're a rare lady, Catwoman.
You're right on time.

18:16.221 --> 18:20.309
I'm rare in more ways than that.

18:20.517 --> 18:25.230
I'm glad you decided to surrender.
We would have caught you eventually.

18:25.772 --> 18:27.858
Do you think so?

18:28.025 --> 18:32.404
Certainly. There's no escaping
the inexorable law of justice.

18:32.613 --> 18:36.116
- Shall we go?
-Must we?

18:36.575 --> 18:38.869
So soon?

18:39.411 --> 18:43.582
I thought that, well, you know...

18:43.790 --> 18:47.753
...perhaps we might get to know each other
a little better.

18:47.919 --> 18:51.423
I would think that we know each other
well enough by now.

18:51.632 --> 18:56.094
Don't run away, Batman. I won't bite.

18:57.179 --> 19:01.600
I'm not afraid of you, Catwoman,
I'm... I'm, uh...

19:02.351 --> 19:05.020
You're very beautiful, Catwoman.

19:05.228 --> 19:10.859
Yes. You're quite right. I am.

19:11.068 --> 19:16.907
Your propinquity could make a man
forget himself.

19:18.617 --> 19:22.079
I don't know what that means
but it sure sounds nice.

19:22.287 --> 19:25.207
I refer to the nearness of you.

19:25.415 --> 19:27.167
Batman...

19:27.459 --> 19:29.503
...let's throw caution to the winds.

19:29.670 --> 19:33.965
I mean, after all,
we are two adult human beings...

19:34.132 --> 19:40.514
...and, uh, we're both interested
in the same thing, happiness.

19:42.516 --> 19:47.020
I can give you more happiness
than anyone in the world.

19:47.896 --> 19:50.774
How do you propose to do that?

19:50.941 --> 19:52.776
By being your partner in life.

19:52.984 --> 19:56.571
I mean, it's me and you
against the world. Ooh.

19:56.738 --> 19:57.989
What about Robin'?

19:58.156 --> 20:00.909
Well, I'll have him killed. Painlessly.

20:01.118 --> 20:04.371
Well, he is a bit of a bore
with his "holy-this" and "holy-that."

20:04.538 --> 20:05.872
That does it, Catwoman.

20:06.039 --> 20:11.044
I thought you had a modicum of decency
but I see that I erred in my judgment.

20:13.130 --> 20:14.840
You're supposed to fall on the floor.

20:15.006 --> 20:18.844
You're attractive, Catwoman,
but not that attractive.

20:19.428 --> 20:22.305
I put on a double dose of Eau de Chat,
that poisonous perfume.

20:22.472 --> 20:24.349
You should have been dead 30 seconds ago.

20:24.516 --> 20:25.851
Aha. Aha!

20:26.017 --> 20:30.188
So all of this lovey-dovey business
was just a trick.

20:30.355 --> 20:33.066
Why aren't you writhing in pain?

20:34.067 --> 20:37.779
I had a hunch that you'd try some thing
not quite kosher.

20:37.946 --> 20:41.408
I've been wearing Batplugs up my nose.

20:41.616 --> 20:46.663
I've been breathing nothing but clean, fresh air
sans Eau de Chat perfume.

20:46.830 --> 20:49.166
You cheated.

20:50.250 --> 20:52.836
Ha! Put up your gloves, Batman.

20:55.714 --> 20:59.676
- I'm gonna practice the art of cat-rate on you.
-Your mistake.

20:59.843 --> 21:01.762
Cat-rate, as you call it...

21:01.928 --> 21:05.056
...correctly pronounced "karate,"
is a defensive form.

21:05.223 --> 21:08.393
Therefore, in order for you to make a move...

21:08.560 --> 21:12.314
...I must move, and I won't.

21:13.064 --> 21:14.775
Well, I have another trick up my paw.

21:14.941 --> 21:18.361
Penn, Brown, Cornell, Freddy, get him!

21:21.156 --> 21:23.033
So you didn't tell the truth.

21:23.200 --> 21:24.868
Did you ever hear of crook who did?

21:25.035 --> 21:28.497
The odds are about right. Four against one.

21:28.663 --> 21:30.040
Four against two, Batman.

21:30.207 --> 21:32.125
- Robin.
- I couldn't resist.

21:32.292 --> 21:36.296
You were taken in by her,
but I'm too young for that sort of thing.

21:36.505 --> 21:40.383
Out of the mouths of Boy Wonders
often times come gems.

22:23.134 --> 22:25.554
- You keep an eye on them. I'll go after her.
-Right.

22:25.720 --> 22:28.056
I can never find my keys
when really need them.

22:28.223 --> 22:30.225
Going my way?

22:31.852 --> 22:34.354
I wish I were, Batman.

22:35.105 --> 22:38.400
But we're fated to travel
in different directions.

22:38.775 --> 22:43.572
You on the straight and narrow
and me on the crooked and wide.

22:44.197 --> 22:50.579
Catwoman, it would be so easy for you
to tread the path of righteousness.

22:50.745 --> 22:53.290
I'm afraid not, Batman.

22:54.749 --> 22:58.336
I need what every woman needs.
The love of a good man.

23:13.351 --> 23:16.563
I'm sorry it had to end this way, Catwoman.

23:17.898 --> 23:20.108
Not half as sorry as I am, Mr. Wayne.

23:20.275 --> 23:25.488
Catwoman, you have destroyed my faith
in my modern penological practices.

23:25.655 --> 23:28.950
Don't judge all criminals by me,
Warden Crichton.

23:29.117 --> 23:32.704
There are a lot of cons that you have
rehabilitated by your methods.

23:32.871 --> 23:34.706
I'm the exception, not the rule.

23:34.873 --> 23:36.625
Catwoman's correct.

23:36.833 --> 23:41.504
This is a model prison.
Be proud of your work, warden.

23:41.713 --> 23:46.551
It's too bad we couldn't get to be
better friends, Mr. Wayne.

23:47.344 --> 23:50.764
A good parole officer
should also be a friend.

23:55.518 --> 23:59.022
I'd like to be your friend.

24:02.192 --> 24:06.237
There's no room for another man in my life,
Mr. Wayne.

24:06.446 --> 24:08.281
You're nice...

24:08.990 --> 24:12.327
...but my heart belongs to Batman.

24:15.580 --> 24:17.415
Good bye.
