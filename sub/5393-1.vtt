00:27.932 --> 00:29.867
Ready? Okay.

00:29.867 --> 00:32.103
Wishing and hoping

00:32.103 --> 00:34.705
And thinking and praying

00:34.705 --> 00:36.774
Planning and dreaming

00:36.774 --> 00:40.277
Each night of his charms

00:40.277 --> 00:45.282
That won't get you
into his arms

00:45.282 --> 00:48.319
So if you're looking
to find love

00:48.319 --> 00:53.457
That you can share

00:53.457 --> 00:55.059
All you've got to do

00:55.059 --> 00:57.294
Is hold him and kiss him

00:57.294 --> 01:01.731
And love him
and show him that you care

01:02.800 --> 01:07.872
Show him that you care
just for him

01:07.872 --> 01:11.976
Do the things
that he likes to do

01:11.976 --> 01:16.913
Wear your hair
just for him

01:18.282 --> 01:20.951
'Cause you won't get him

01:20.951 --> 01:24.421
Thinking and praying
Wishing and hoping

01:24.421 --> 01:27.158
Just wishing and hoping

01:27.158 --> 01:29.660
And thinking and praying

01:29.660 --> 01:35.166
Planning and dreaming
his kisses will start

01:35.166 --> 01:39.102
That won't get you
into his heart

01:40.304 --> 01:43.507
So if you're thinking
of how great

01:43.507 --> 01:47.637
True love is

01:52.183 --> 01:54.518
And squeeze him
and love him

01:54.518 --> 01:58.189
Just do it
and after you do

01:58.189 --> 02:01.124
You will be his

03:24.608 --> 03:28.779
Two and two, menu !
Brian, 22, immediately!

03:28.779 --> 03:30.447
Guillermo!

03:30.447 --> 03:32.783
Two pigeons! Right away!

03:32.783 --> 03:35.149
''V. I.P.''
Very important table right here!

03:42.493 --> 03:43.482
Give me two grain!

03:44.795 --> 03:47.898
- I'll take that polenta!
- All right, Chef.

03:47.898 --> 03:49.900
- This is the one I'm waiting for!
- Yes, sir.

03:49.900 --> 03:53.737
I need that special meat now.
Pastry, get ready. It's coming at you.

03:53.737 --> 03:56.473
I will kill your family it you don't
get this right. I need this perfect.

03:56.473 --> 03:57.497
Yes, sir.

04:15.993 --> 04:18.495
I'm writing it up as...

04:18.495 --> 04:20.831
inventive and...

04:20.831 --> 04:22.264
confident.

04:27.438 --> 04:31.932
- Did the chap from Newsday ever call?
- I'll check my machine.

04:33.177 --> 04:36.013
Is this a real interview
or some cute guy...

04:36.013 --> 04:38.015
- you're setting me up with?
- Please, Julianne.

04:38.015 --> 04:40.851
I don't send you men anymore.
You have no idea what to do with them.

04:40.851 --> 04:45.189
it’s Michael.
Jules, it must be months, huh?

04:45.189 --> 04:51.028
l can't wait to talk to you.
I'm in Chicago at the Drake Hotel.

04:51.028 --> 04:55.032
Call me. 4:00 in the morning,
whatever. We gotta talk. Bye.

04:55.032 --> 04:59.203
- Who called? Man of the moment?
- No, the opposite.

04:59.203 --> 05:03.140
It's my Michael. Michael O'Neal.
Sounds desperate to talk to me.

05:03.140 --> 05:06.677
The wandering sportswriter.
Remind me about that one.

05:06.677 --> 05:08.178
Sophomore year at Brown...

05:08.178 --> 05:11.882
we had this one hot month.

05:11.882 --> 05:15.886
But you know me.
I got restless.

05:15.886 --> 05:19.556
So I get up the nerve
to break his heart...

05:19.556 --> 05:21.547
and he gives me this look.

05:22.926 --> 05:25.229
Then he said, ''The thing
that makes me want to cry is...

05:25.229 --> 05:28.565
I'm losing the best friend
I ever had.''

05:28.565 --> 05:32.403
At that moment,
I knew I tell the same way.

05:32.403 --> 05:36.407
So I cried for maybe
the third time in my entire life...

05:36.407 --> 05:38.075
kissed him...

05:38.075 --> 05:40.839
and we've been best friends
ever since.

05:42.079 --> 05:44.343
We've seen each other
through everything:

05:46.250 --> 05:48.252
losing jobs...

05:48.252 --> 05:50.754
losing parents, losing lovers.

05:50.754 --> 05:53.690
We've traveled all over.

05:53.690 --> 05:56.427
The best times of my life, maybe.

05:56.427 --> 06:00.597
Drinking and talking,
even if it's just over the phone.

06:00.597 --> 06:04.034
Go on. This is so moving.
Kindred spirits?

06:04.034 --> 06:07.697
He's nothing Like me.
He's Like you actually, only straight.

06:09.006 --> 06:12.576
I remember this one night
in Tucson six years ago.

06:12.576 --> 06:15.612
He takes a razor out
of this little shaving kit...

06:15.612 --> 06:18.615
cuts his finger, takes my hand,
does the same to me.

06:18.615 --> 06:21.952
- I'm gonna be sick.
- He says, ''Swear when we're 28...

06:21.952 --> 06:24.922
if we've never married,
we marry each other.''

06:24.922 --> 06:27.658
We never talked about it again.

06:27.658 --> 06:31.462
I don't know
what made me think of that.

06:31.462 --> 06:34.659
You're about to be 28
in three weeks, right?

06:35.799 --> 06:40.003
- How old is he?
- You think?

06:40.003 --> 06:42.801
Desperate to talk.

06:51.315 --> 06:52.748
Cheers.

06:55.352 --> 06:58.287
''Digital Answering System''
''Play''

07:04.795 --> 07:06.262
''Red''

07:14.004 --> 07:17.508
- Good evening. The Drake Hotel.
- I'm calling for Michael O'Neal...

07:17.508 --> 07:20.602
- but since it's so late--
- One moment, please.

07:23.013 --> 07:24.446
Hello?

07:26.683 --> 07:29.853
You've been enrolled
in the Obscene caller of the Month Club.

07:29.853 --> 07:32.856
Hey, beautiful.
it’s so great to hear your voice.

07:32.856 --> 07:36.193
l miss you. I've been
calling you for over a month.

07:36.193 --> 07:38.028
I've been on a book tour.

07:38.028 --> 07:41.198
- I figured you were out of town.
- My machine eats all my messages.

07:41.198 --> 07:43.534
Or you're just averaging 30 days
to return a call.

07:43.534 --> 07:48.372
- it’s less when it's you.
- I have to ask you something important.

07:48.372 --> 07:50.374
lf you turn me down,
l don't know what I'll do.

07:50.374 --> 07:54.470
It I could just tell you
one thing first.

07:56.380 --> 07:59.550
This is probably going
to hand you...

07:59.550 --> 08:02.553
the biggest laugh
of your adult life...

08:02.553 --> 08:05.389
but I was thinking about you,
and I was remembering...

08:05.389 --> 08:10.394
this unbelievably insane night
we spent in Tucson...

08:10.394 --> 08:13.230
like a thousand years ago.

08:13.230 --> 08:15.566
- You probably won't remember this--
- Are you kidding?

08:15.566 --> 08:18.569
l think about that night
all the time.

08:18.569 --> 08:20.571
You do?

08:20.571 --> 08:23.907
But it's not why I called.

08:23.907 --> 08:25.409
It's not.

08:25.409 --> 08:28.503
l called because I met someone.

08:30.914 --> 08:32.582
That's great.

08:32.582 --> 08:37.754
You haven't really seen anybody
since that dingbat Jenny Lee, have you?

08:37.754 --> 08:39.423
You don't understand.

08:39.423 --> 08:42.426
I've never felt this way
about anybody.

08:42.426 --> 08:46.263
- She's all wrong for me.
- That's a good start.

08:46.263 --> 08:48.432
She's a junior
at the University of Chicago.

08:48.432 --> 08:51.602
She's 20. Her name's Kim.
You're gonna love her. She's beautiful.

08:51.602 --> 08:55.439
Her dad is this billionaire. He owns
the White Sox and some cable empire.

08:55.439 --> 08:58.108
I've always been uncomfortable
around rich people.

08:58.108 --> 09:01.778
- Sure.
- But they're not like that.

09:01.778 --> 09:06.283
They're such wonderful people.
Salt of the earth.

09:06.283 --> 09:08.547
So you've met her parents?

09:10.454 --> 09:13.787
Jules, we're getting married
this Sunday.

09:15.792 --> 09:18.226
- Hello?
- Michael--

09:20.297 --> 09:22.466
It's Wednesday night.

09:22.466 --> 09:24.635
How can you possibly
be getting married on Sunday?

09:24.635 --> 09:26.303
Actually, it starts tomorrow.

09:26.303 --> 09:29.306
it’s a four-day wedding
with all the traditional events...

09:29.306 --> 09:33.810
and 10 million people
flying in from all over the world.

09:33.810 --> 09:37.981
Aren't you working this weekend?
Is that responsible?

09:37.981 --> 09:43.487
The Sox are at home and Sports is
letting me do a profile on Frank Thomas.

09:43.487 --> 09:45.656
Wait.
What do you mean, irresponsible?

09:45.656 --> 09:48.250
Taking off a weekend
to get married?

09:50.160 --> 09:52.253
Jules, I'm scared.

09:53.997 --> 09:58.001
- Maybe we should talk about this.
- I need you.

09:58.001 --> 10:01.338
lf you can't come and hold my hand,
I'll never get through this.

10:01.338 --> 10:03.272
Please come.

10:05.676 --> 10:08.879
l can 't wait for you
to meet her.

10:08.879 --> 10:12.849
''United Airlines''
Listen, Jules.

10:12.849 --> 10:14.851
Let's stop for a drink.
You can take a later flight.

10:14.851 --> 10:18.689
I'm a busy girl. I've got four days
to break up a wedding...

10:18.689 --> 10:22.793
steal the bride's fellow,
and I haven't one clue how to do it.

10:22.793 --> 10:25.529
He adored me
for nine goddamn years.

10:25.529 --> 10:29.232
- I can see why.
- She has known him for five seconds.

10:29.232 --> 10:32.703
Plus, she's got billions of dollars,
and she's apparently perfect.

10:32.703 --> 10:37.140
So don't go feeling all sorry
for Miss Preteen Illinois.

10:39.543 --> 10:42.979
l can't lose him, George.
I'm going to bring him back.

10:45.048 --> 10:46.216
You give your hand to me

10:46.216 --> 10:49.052
You give your hand to me

10:49.052 --> 10:51.520
And then you say hello

10:52.589 --> 10:55.892
l can hardly speak

10:55.892 --> 10:59.396
My heart is beating so

10:59.396 --> 11:03.066
And anyone can tell

11:03.066 --> 11:06.236
You think you know me well

11:06.236 --> 11:09.603
But you don't know me

11:12.409 --> 11:16.580
No, you don't know the one

11:16.580 --> 11:20.250
Who dreams of you at night

11:20.250 --> 11:23.587
Wants to kiss your lips

11:23.587 --> 11:26.590
Wants to hold you tight

11:26.590 --> 11:29.926
l am just a friend

11:29.926 --> 11:33.597
That's all I've ever been

11:33.597 --> 11:37.363
- Can you believe I'm gonna do this?
- Not hardly.

11:52.616 --> 11:55.719
This just makes everything
so perfect.

11:55.719 --> 12:00.247
Since I've met Michael, all I've heard
is ''Julianne this'' and ''Julianne that.''

12:01.124 --> 12:03.092
I've never had a sister.

12:11.134 --> 12:13.570
I have this monstrous favor
to ask you.

12:13.570 --> 12:15.305
- Excuse me?
- My best friend...

12:15.305 --> 12:20.811
shattered her pelvis line dancing
in Abilene over spring break.

12:20.811 --> 12:23.279
- Be my maid of honor?
- What?

12:24.815 --> 12:29.619
Shouldn't you promote a bridesmaid
or someone you've known longer?

12:29.619 --> 12:33.156
My bridesmaids are my only two
female relatives under the age of 40...

12:33.156 --> 12:37.160
debutante sisters from Nashville
who are basically vengeful sluts.

12:37.160 --> 12:38.457
My exit!

12:41.364 --> 12:43.934
I have tour days
to make you my new best friend.

12:43.934 --> 12:46.994
It's time for you
to force yourself to get personal.

13:01.017 --> 13:03.687
- Do you like the color?
- I think it's beautiful.

13:03.687 --> 13:05.689
- Isn't that perfect for her?
- absolutely.

13:05.689 --> 13:08.692
This is going to be tighter.
You don't want those things to fall out.

13:08.692 --> 13:11.895
- It's beautiful.
- I'm not hurting you.

13:11.895 --> 13:16.800
I don't want her to trip,
so I'll take this up a tiny bit.

13:16.800 --> 13:19.166
Would you rather the daffodil?

13:21.238 --> 13:25.041
I thought the bridesmaids
all wore the same dress.

13:25.041 --> 13:29.068
Not you. You wouldn't be comfortable
unless you were distinctive.

13:31.715 --> 13:34.017
What else did he tell you?

13:34.017 --> 13:37.053
You hate weddings.
You never go.

13:37.053 --> 13:39.556
You're not up
for anything conventional...

13:39.556 --> 13:43.492
or anything that's assumed
to be a female priority...

13:44.728 --> 13:49.065
including marriage
or romance or even--

13:49.065 --> 13:50.657
Love?

13:52.569 --> 13:55.405
Michael and I were a wrong tip
right from the start.

13:55.405 --> 13:58.074
He said that too.

13:58.074 --> 14:02.412
I thought I was like you,
and proud to be...

14:02.412 --> 14:05.615
until I met rumpled,
smelly, old Michael.

14:05.615 --> 14:08.084
Then I found I was just
a sentimental schmuck...

14:08.084 --> 14:11.755
like all those flighty nitwits
I'd always pitied.

14:11.755 --> 14:13.746
It's funny, huh?

14:15.091 --> 14:17.685
l need a cigarette.

14:26.436 --> 14:28.438
George, how do you think I feel?

14:28.438 --> 14:31.107
all she does is talk
about her and Michael's future.

14:31.107 --> 14:36.079
- She's just so dreamy.
- Jules, pull yourself together.

14:36.079 --> 14:38.309
I don't know if I can do it.

14:40.216 --> 14:42.786
You want me to turn around
or something?

14:42.786 --> 14:46.552
Not the person I was expecting.

14:49.592 --> 14:52.220
I've seen you
a lot more naked than that.

14:54.464 --> 14:58.901
Things are different now.

15:02.639 --> 15:04.573
I guess so.

15:09.512 --> 15:12.649
You look really good...

15:12.649 --> 15:14.947
without your clothes on.

15:25.829 --> 15:27.262
She's toast.

15:29.332 --> 15:31.425
''Caution 2-Way Traffic''
''Exit''

15:36.172 --> 15:38.842
- Where is the honeymoon exactly?
- It depends.

15:38.842 --> 15:42.345
If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento,
we could start there.
''Chicago Hilton And Towers''

15:42.345 --> 15:44.848
Or Phoenix. Or depending
on the Indiana-Cleveland game--

15:44.848 --> 15:46.516
Garden spots, all.

15:46.516 --> 15:49.686
A swing of maybe 40 degrees Fahrenheit
represents a packing challenge...

15:49.686 --> 15:53.523
but there's tine food and cocktails
at a choice of Embassy Suites.

15:53.523 --> 15:57.660
it’s his career. I'm supportive.
I've been everywhere.

15:57.660 --> 16:01.798
I want to be with the man I love.
That's what makes it a honeymoon.

16:01.798 --> 16:07.771
He's lucky. One woman in a billion
could put up with his shit.

16:07.771 --> 16:11.007
The guy's a one-man festival
of idiosyncratic--

16:11.007 --> 16:13.676
You've been introduced
to the symphonic range--

16:13.676 --> 16:16.880
Of his snoring?
He says it's worse than ever.

16:16.880 --> 16:19.178
You know that snarfle one?

16:21.885 --> 16:25.981
Now it's got this phlegm-rattling thing
happening behind it.

16:33.563 --> 16:35.065
Earplugs work.

16:35.065 --> 16:38.268
- What about--
- Cigars in bed? I broke him of that.

16:38.268 --> 16:41.204
The bathroom's a swamp.
He wears Reeboks to dinner.

16:41.204 --> 16:45.008
He likes action movies.
He reads over my Shoulder.

16:45.008 --> 16:46.943
He loves karaoke bars...

16:46.943 --> 16:49.245
- and I can't carry a tune.
- Really?

16:49.245 --> 16:51.748
He sucks soup
through his front teeth.

16:51.748 --> 16:55.081
That's a trademark move.
Don't touch that one.

16:56.920 --> 16:59.354
But he sure can kiss.

17:01.591 --> 17:05.185
It's been a while.
I'm just gonna take your word on that.

17:10.767 --> 17:15.105
After two weeks
of cataloging all his faults...

17:15.105 --> 17:18.040
I made a command decision
that changed my life.

17:23.113 --> 17:24.646
I threw the list away.

17:24.646 --> 17:26.983
He's not a balance sheet.
He's Michael.

17:26.983 --> 17:29.085
Loving him means
loving all of him.

17:29.085 --> 17:30.887
Do you get nervous
in confined spaces?

17:30.887 --> 17:32.956
It's sweet of you
to want to be protective...

17:32.956 --> 17:36.759
but nothing ever could give me
one moment's pause about this marriage.

17:36.759 --> 17:40.991
- Do you become hysterical in confined--
- Except one.

17:42.132 --> 17:44.434
You. You're always
in his mind....

17:44.434 --> 17:46.769
this perfect creature
he loved for years.

17:46.769 --> 17:49.806
perfection can get wearing
after awhile.

17:49.806 --> 17:52.642
I'm not kidding. I had to face up
to my competitive drives.

17:52.642 --> 17:54.978
believe me, I've got them.

17:54.978 --> 17:58.314
Am I gonna be jealous of you
for the rest of my life?

17:58.314 --> 18:00.450
- Our paths will keep crossing.
- Space. of course.

18:00.450 --> 18:01.985
- He'll always talk about you.
- It's only natural.

18:01.985 --> 18:05.155
The answer was so simple.

18:05.155 --> 18:08.158
I was gonna predict that.

18:08.158 --> 18:09.591
You win.

18:12.428 --> 18:13.861
I've missed a step.

18:14.998 --> 18:18.001
He's got you on a pedestal...

18:18.001 --> 18:19.969
and me in his arms.

18:27.844 --> 18:31.881
My God, it's the bride
and the woman she'll never live up to.

18:31.881 --> 18:34.684
- Are you okay, honey?
- That would be us.

18:34.684 --> 18:37.353
Did she say the wrong thing again?
That is so in character.

18:37.353 --> 18:39.522
- I'm Julianne Potter.
- We'd be the vengeful sluts.

18:39.522 --> 18:43.693
- You can just call us eager.
- Have you sized up the groomsmen?

18:43.693 --> 18:47.697
- As maid of honor, you get first pick.
- Don't pick the short, hairy, tat one.

18:47.697 --> 18:50.200
- He's mine.
- Kimmy's a virgin.

18:50.200 --> 18:52.635
Is this Michael's Julianne?

18:52.635 --> 18:55.205
I'm Isabelle Wallace.

18:55.205 --> 18:58.003
My handsome new son
scarcely did you justice.

18:59.242 --> 19:02.712
My husband says
to scoot you to the ballpark...

19:02.712 --> 19:04.814
so you can hang with Michael.

19:04.814 --> 19:07.884
But first you have to meet
a lot of really old women.

19:07.884 --> 19:11.149
That is, it you've absorbed
enough profanity.

19:25.201 --> 19:26.703
Who ordered a beer?

19:26.703 --> 19:31.541
- Let me help you with that.
- You unwittingly imply I'm clumsy.

19:31.541 --> 19:34.244
Sorry. I was confusing you
with somebody I used to know.

19:34.244 --> 19:37.380
Julianne Potter, this is Hank and Eric
from Sport magazine.

19:37.380 --> 19:39.382
- Nice to meet you.
- They kindly gave me a job.

19:39.382 --> 19:42.018
- Hi, there.
- How do you do?

19:42.018 --> 19:45.288
And this is Walter,
my father-in-Law.

19:45.288 --> 19:47.757
Future father-in-Law.
''Comiskey''

19:47.757 --> 19:49.259
Thank you.

19:49.259 --> 19:51.887
If he gives you any grief,
come see me.

19:53.463 --> 19:57.267
- And this guy you know.
- Papa Joe.

19:57.267 --> 20:02.772
I told him to make you best man,
but he had to go with his baby brother.

20:02.772 --> 20:05.441
Best-looking guy
in any room.

20:05.441 --> 20:08.378
- Great to see you.
- That will do.

20:08.378 --> 20:11.614
- Scotty, that will do.
- Sorry.

20:11.614 --> 20:14.284
Remember, it is the duty
of the best man...

20:14.284 --> 20:17.587
to dance
with the maid of honor.

20:17.587 --> 20:20.123
Dance? You can't dance.

20:20.123 --> 20:25.060
- When did you Learn to dance?
- I've got moves you've never seen.

20:26.496 --> 20:28.327
You're an impostor.

20:29.966 --> 20:32.302
What did you do
with my best friend?

20:32.302 --> 20:35.805
''Chicago Tribune"
I'm still your best friend.

20:35.805 --> 20:38.467
You just haven't seen me
for awhile.

20:42.979 --> 20:47.417
Some people might find
that kind of perfection boring...

20:47.417 --> 20:50.653
- day after day, year after year.
- That's what I thought at first.

20:50.653 --> 20:52.822
How can you like someone
that perfect?

20:52.822 --> 20:56.492
No potential
for long-range Likeability.

20:56.492 --> 21:00.330
But then, she does have
a few good traits.

21:00.330 --> 21:01.831
- All right.
- Such as?

21:01.831 --> 21:04.133
They got him.

21:04.133 --> 21:06.669
When I hug her,
even in public...

21:06.669 --> 21:09.505
I don't have to let go
right away.

21:09.505 --> 21:12.008
She lets me hold her
as long as I want.

21:12.008 --> 21:16.012
- Batting second, the shortstop--
- What?

21:16.012 --> 21:19.182
- Nothing.
- I forgot.

21:19.182 --> 21:21.884
You and that yucky love stuff.

21:21.884 --> 21:24.020
You always get like that
when it gets sentimental.

21:24.020 --> 21:26.215
I do not.

21:27.890 --> 21:30.827
When we were--
When you and I were--

21:30.827 --> 21:32.954
- When we were--
- Together?

21:37.233 --> 21:39.135
Did I, when--

21:39.135 --> 21:43.172
- Yes.
- Yes, what?

21:43.172 --> 21:46.232
You pulled away when I tried
to hug you in public.

21:51.681 --> 21:54.283
I've changed.

21:54.283 --> 21:56.808
I mean, I'm not the girl
that I once was.

21:58.154 --> 21:59.756
Really?

21:59.756 --> 22:02.691
Any relationship over two weeks
I should know about?

22:03.626 --> 22:06.026
This is not about longevity.

22:07.363 --> 22:09.932
This is about...

22:09.932 --> 22:12.335
being comfortable...

22:12.335 --> 22:14.326
with the yucky love stuff.

22:17.673 --> 22:19.275
all right.

22:19.275 --> 22:21.766
And I am.

22:24.547 --> 22:28.251
And it's wisdom born of pain

22:28.251 --> 22:30.753
Yes, I've paid the price

22:30.753 --> 22:33.689
But look how much I've gained

22:33.689 --> 22:35.925
- If I have to
- Karaoke!

22:35.925 --> 22:37.760
- I can do anything
- Where did you find this place?

22:37.760 --> 22:40.263
The doorman told me.
And you are singing the song.

22:40.263 --> 22:44.767
l am strong
l am invincible

22:44.767 --> 22:48.362
l am woman

22:54.444 --> 22:56.378
I didn't realize
this was a karaoke bar.

22:57.447 --> 22:59.749
This is so great.
My two best girls.

22:59.749 --> 23:02.952
- You folks thirsty?
- Margarita.

23:02.952 --> 23:04.787
- Blended, no salt.
- She wants it straight up.

23:04.787 --> 23:06.456
- You?
- Amstel Light.

23:06.456 --> 23:08.458
Two words for you.

23:08.458 --> 23:10.560
Margarita.

23:10.560 --> 23:12.221
Vespa.

23:13.796 --> 23:15.229
Florence.

23:16.966 --> 23:18.968
Me hanging on in the rain.

23:18.968 --> 23:21.937
- I love Florence.
- And the guy with the thing.

23:24.173 --> 23:25.675
Where was my pass?

23:25.675 --> 23:28.644
- ''No, the pier is for fishing!''
- ''French kissing?''

23:28.644 --> 23:32.080
- ''Fishing!''
- I've always loved Florence.

23:33.649 --> 23:38.086
You Should take her there.
She's perky. She deserves a honeymoon.

23:40.990 --> 23:44.260
''If San Antonio
sweeps Sacramento''?

23:44.260 --> 23:48.162
You're off the road in September, and
when does tall quarter start for you?

23:52.168 --> 23:56.298
I'm not coming back senior year.

23:58.841 --> 24:04.380
Don't architects find a degree
sort of an asset?

24:04.380 --> 24:08.684
I travel every week. Got college ball,
motor sports, training camps.

24:08.684 --> 24:11.687
I think the most important thing
is for us to be together.

24:11.687 --> 24:16.559
Say, Pinky, I wanna hear you sing.
Come on.

24:16.559 --> 24:18.823
Kimmy hates to sing.
She hates it.

24:22.832 --> 24:24.901
all right, folks.
Everybody...

24:24.901 --> 24:29.472
my bride-to-be here
is about to kick some ass on--

24:29.472 --> 24:31.741
What?
It will be fun.

24:31.741 --> 24:34.410
No, she doesn't want to, Michael.
Leave her alone.

24:34.410 --> 24:37.380
Come on.
Ladies and gentlemen...

24:37.380 --> 24:41.417
Please give it up for the dazzling
vocal stylings...

24:41.417 --> 24:43.749
of Miss Kimberly Wallace!

24:48.691 --> 24:49.817
Come on.

25:03.372 --> 25:09.245
l just don 't know what to do
with myself

25:09.245 --> 25:13.716
Don't know just what to do
with myself

25:13.716 --> 25:17.887
I'm so used to doing

25:17.887 --> 25:20.256
Everything for you

25:20.256 --> 25:25.928
- You suck!
- Planning everything for two

25:25.928 --> 25:29.932
And now that we're through

25:29.932 --> 25:31.734
l just don't know

25:31.734 --> 25:36.539
What to do with my time

25:36.539 --> 25:39.108
I'm so lonesome for you

25:39.108 --> 25:41.243
It's a crime

25:41.243 --> 25:44.906
Going to a movie

26:13.976 --> 26:17.647
lf your new love

26:17.647 --> 26:20.316
Ever turns you down

26:20.316 --> 26:22.451
Come back

26:22.451 --> 26:27.650
I will be around
just waiting for you

26:29.492 --> 26:33.588
l just don 't know what to do

26:34.830 --> 26:37.924
Like a summer rose

26:39.835 --> 26:43.271
It needs the sun and the rain

26:45.508 --> 26:50.846
l need your sweet love

26:50.846 --> 26:56.148
l need your sweet love to ease

26:58.854 --> 27:04.622
All the pain

27:10.866 --> 27:13.357
That was just terrible!

27:22.311 --> 27:25.881
''Steakhouse'' ''Park'' ''Taxi''
- You won't be lonely without us?
- Desperately.

27:25.881 --> 27:28.884
- Maybe we don't have to go.
- Your grandmother's dinner?

27:28.884 --> 27:32.555
As bride-to-be,
she's got you on a technicality.

27:32.555 --> 27:37.893
I'd baby-sit you, but my loyalty
is to the bride in her time of need.

27:37.893 --> 27:42.398
- It's not really a time of need.
- If you're sure.

27:42.398 --> 27:46.562
- ''Sure''?
- I'll stay with Michael it you're sure.

27:50.072 --> 27:52.836
- Call me later?
- of course.

27:56.912 --> 27:59.506
- Bye.
- Have fun.

28:11.927 --> 28:14.597
Were you pretty shocked
when I told you?

28:14.597 --> 28:16.531
Shocked? No.

28:19.101 --> 28:21.270
A little.

28:21.270 --> 28:24.706
A lot.
I tell oft the bed.

28:25.941 --> 28:28.811
That explains the thump.

28:28.811 --> 28:31.041
You like her, don't you?

28:32.948 --> 28:36.452
- I do.
- That's enthusiastic.

28:36.452 --> 28:39.888
I mean, she's--
She's great.

28:42.958 --> 28:47.129
She seriously
can't sing a note.

28:47.129 --> 28:52.101
But to make that kind
of sacrifice--

28:52.101 --> 28:57.173
- What? Leaving school?
- all of it.

28:57.173 --> 29:00.810
Putting her career on hold
to follow you around in this dumb job...

29:00.810 --> 29:03.646
where you travel 52 weeks a year...

29:03.646 --> 29:07.149
to places
like College Station, Texas.

29:07.149 --> 29:11.287
- ''Dumb job''?
- It's not a grown-up job.

29:11.287 --> 29:13.856
My job never bothered you before.

29:13.856 --> 29:17.927
It doesn't bother me now,
but I'm not Kimmy.

29:17.927 --> 29:23.490
Her father owns the Sox
and cable sports.

29:25.167 --> 29:29.171
I'm just surprised
it hasn't come up, that's all.

29:29.171 --> 29:30.763
What?

29:32.508 --> 29:34.643
The corner office with a view.

29:34.643 --> 29:37.513
You in a nice blue suit.

29:37.513 --> 29:41.851
Permanent Chicago address,
somewhat close to Mom and Dad.

29:41.851 --> 29:43.519
Never.

29:43.519 --> 29:46.181
She would never even think of that.

29:47.456 --> 29:49.390
You don't know her.

29:58.033 --> 30:00.202
- But Michael loves his job.
- Sure.

30:00.202 --> 30:03.372
Bad games, bad pay,
bad towns, bad flights...

30:03.372 --> 30:05.875
bad hotels, real bad food...

30:05.875 --> 30:08.043
homeless, rootless, lonely...

30:08.043 --> 30:10.379
your copy makes it
in one issue out of tour.

30:10.379 --> 30:12.381
What's not to love?

30:12.381 --> 30:16.218
Why would he trade that for running,
say, a piece of the public relations...

30:16.218 --> 30:20.055
at a powerful complex conglomerate
like your father's?

30:20.055 --> 30:24.355
- That's what my father and I discussed.
- I'm not surprised.

30:26.395 --> 30:29.231
So do you think
he'd really accept?

30:29.231 --> 30:30.900
Michael?
A job like that?

30:30.900 --> 30:34.570
It would be the greatest thing
that ever happened to him.

30:34.570 --> 30:37.072
Present company excepted.

30:37.072 --> 30:41.944
This is what we do:
We make your dad a coconspirator.

30:41.944 --> 30:43.946
Michael does a favor for Walter.

30:43.946 --> 30:46.582
Walter's reorganizing
his public relations...

30:46.582 --> 30:49.084
and needs a brilliant guy
that he's close to...

30:49.084 --> 30:51.587
that he can completely trust.

30:51.587 --> 30:54.590
Then you beg.
'Michael, please do this for Daddy.

30:54.590 --> 30:58.082
It's only six months.
It would mean so much to me. "

31:00.162 --> 31:04.861
- He'll see right through it.
- Only if he wants to.

31:05.768 --> 31:07.269
At the end of six months...

31:07.269 --> 31:10.072
he will be happy...

31:10.072 --> 31:11.874
settled...

31:11.874 --> 31:13.603
successful.

31:28.290 --> 31:29.723
Wow.

31:30.926 --> 31:33.462
You look beautiful.
Do you have a date later?

31:33.462 --> 31:34.895
Never can tell.

31:36.265 --> 31:39.826
Just the way you look tonight
Remember?

31:41.470 --> 31:44.769
Okay, kid, you're up.

31:54.650 --> 31:57.744
It's really my father
who needs the favor.

32:00.322 --> 32:04.827
He's reorganizing some
of the divisions of the company.

32:04.827 --> 32:08.194
Public relations
is a real problem area for him.

32:10.666 --> 32:14.295
It would only be
six months maybe.

32:16.005 --> 32:20.342
- Or three or four.
- You knew about this?

32:20.342 --> 32:24.335
I think you ought to Listen to her.
it’s her life too.

32:27.049 --> 32:30.052
You gonna tell me
that Walter thought this one up?

32:30.052 --> 32:34.189
Why don't you start
by being honest one second.

32:34.189 --> 32:36.525
I am being honest.

32:36.525 --> 32:40.029
all of a sudden I'm supposed
to drop out of school...

32:40.029 --> 32:42.131
forget my family,
forget my career...

32:42.131 --> 32:46.702
- forget the things I had planned?
- Forgive me for screwing up your plans.

32:46.702 --> 32:49.538
Glad I heard this
before it's too Late.

32:49.538 --> 32:52.808
- What is that supposed to mean?
- What am I supposed to do with my life?

32:52.808 --> 32:56.045
I work in a low-paying,
zero-respect job...

32:56.045 --> 32:59.173
which, unfortunately,
I happen to love.

33:02.251 --> 33:07.222
- It sounds like a great opportunity.
- Does it really?

33:07.222 --> 33:10.726
How come you never took
some sellout establishment job?

33:10.726 --> 33:13.228
I'll tell you why,
because that isn't you.

33:13.228 --> 33:15.898
- And it's not me either.
- lf that's the way you feel--

33:15.898 --> 33:19.701
Damn straight that's how I feel !
Just come out and say it.

33:19.701 --> 33:23.205
My job's not good enough.
I'm not good enough.

33:23.205 --> 33:27.505
- I never said that!
- Yes, you did.

33:30.079 --> 33:32.047
Great, Kim.

33:32.047 --> 33:36.074
Two days before our wedding, you Lay
this on me. I'm supposed to roll over?

33:39.088 --> 33:42.591
Fine. I'm an insensitive.
sexist asshole.

33:42.591 --> 33:44.422
You're better oft without me.

33:45.861 --> 33:51.066
You are so right.
l was so wrong.

33:51.066 --> 33:54.470
We settled this, and I reneged.
That just wasn't fair.

33:54.470 --> 33:59.108
You have to forgive me and forget
this happened or I'll just die.

33:59.108 --> 34:00.541
Please.

34:05.614 --> 34:07.479
I'm sorry.

34:32.641 --> 34:35.310
George and Werner are not in.

34:35.310 --> 34:37.646
Brevity is the order of the day.

34:37.646 --> 34:39.947
George, answer this, damn it

34:39.947 --> 34:43.485
I'm in a meltdown here!
She double-crossed me!

34:43.485 --> 34:47.822
The little twerp groveled
She's so wrong for him.

34:47.822 --> 34:52.661
Michael and I are the same person:
self-absorbed and vaguely loveable.

34:52.661 --> 34:55.164
We deserve each other.
I'm running out of time.

34:55.164 --> 34:58.967
I'm completely out of sneaky ideas.
l have come to the end...

34:58.967 --> 35:00.836
of my rapidly fraying rope!

35:00.836 --> 35:03.430
You have got to think of something!

35:07.843 --> 35:11.438
- Coffee, anyone?
- That would be wonderful.

35:13.515 --> 35:17.178
''The Drake''

35:48.483 --> 35:51.887
This is very Marcel Marceau.

35:51.887 --> 35:56.558
Now, relax. We don't want your face
coming off with it, do we?

35:56.558 --> 35:58.458
What a hideous room.

35:59.528 --> 36:02.827
Death by a mini-bar.
How glamorous.

36:06.568 --> 36:09.571
You flew all the way here.
You hate to fly.

36:09.571 --> 36:13.709
I have to go back this evening.
We have a family thing in the Hamptons.

36:13.709 --> 36:15.643
You're butting in.

36:16.912 --> 36:20.382
What I mean when I say
she's annoyingly perfect...

36:20.382 --> 36:23.252
is that there is nothing annoying
about her perfection.

36:23.252 --> 36:28.223
It is vulnerable and endearing.
And that is annoying as shit.

36:28.223 --> 36:30.225
You like her.

36:30.225 --> 36:32.352
It I didn't have to hate her,
I'd adore her.

36:33.595 --> 36:36.331
This is my whole life's happiness.

36:36.331 --> 36:38.265
I have to be ruthless.

36:39.501 --> 36:42.104
He was in love with me
every day for nine years.

36:42.104 --> 36:44.106
I can make him happier
than she can.

36:44.106 --> 36:46.275
I am breaking her heart
in the short run...

36:46.275 --> 36:48.944
but really doing her
a gigantic favor.

36:48.944 --> 36:53.711
She would be so miserable tagging along
after this insensitive doofus.

37:02.624 --> 37:05.294
Do you really love him...

37:05.294 --> 37:07.462
or is this just about winning?

37:07.462 --> 37:08.895
Seriously.

37:12.134 --> 37:16.805
In the beginning,
it was mostly this prior claim.

37:16.805 --> 37:18.898
He belonged to me.

37:21.310 --> 37:25.314
But now, when I'm with him...

37:25.314 --> 37:29.151
he's just so wonderful.

37:29.151 --> 37:33.655
How come I never knew that
when I could have had him?

37:33.655 --> 37:37.250
It's amazing the clarity that comes
with psychotic jealousy.

37:39.995 --> 37:42.331
George, believe me...

37:42.331 --> 37:45.167
if he was feeling
what I'm feeling...

37:45.167 --> 37:47.836
then he would know how I feel.

37:47.836 --> 37:50.339
It's horrible.

37:50.339 --> 37:51.931
What?

37:53.508 --> 37:55.942
Just tell him you love him.

37:58.347 --> 38:02.851
tell him you've loved him
for nine years...

38:02.851 --> 38:05.445
but you were afraid of love.

38:06.855 --> 38:10.192
Tell him you were afraid of love,
afraid of needing.

38:10.192 --> 38:13.028
- Needing what?
- To belong to someone.

38:13.028 --> 38:15.197
We all are, sweetheart.

38:15.197 --> 38:17.866
I'm sorry about that.

38:17.866 --> 38:23.438
Tell him this is the worst, cruelest,
dumbest moment to do this to him...

38:23.438 --> 38:25.374
but there it is.

38:25.374 --> 38:27.467
He's got to choose.

38:28.710 --> 38:31.880
tell him the actual truth?

38:31.880 --> 38:35.817
Maybe not the actual truth.

38:35.817 --> 38:39.446
Highlights.

38:45.060 --> 38:48.029
Arms at your sides, Please.

39:00.075 --> 39:02.744
- Good morning.
- I have to talk to you.

39:02.744 --> 39:06.415
- You don't like the suit?
- That's not what I have to talk about.

39:06.415 --> 39:08.679
One thing first.
Excuse me.

39:15.257 --> 39:18.760
- Guard this with your life.
- What is it?

39:18.760 --> 39:21.263
- The ring.
- Why are you giving it to me?

39:21.263 --> 39:24.266
- I don't trust Scotty with it.
- I don't think--

39:24.266 --> 39:26.101
Please.

39:26.101 --> 39:28.603
You're practically
the best man anyway.

39:28.603 --> 39:31.697
- Thank you.
- Open it.

39:33.275 --> 39:34.742
will she like it?

39:41.616 --> 39:44.553
- What did you want to talk about?
- What?

39:44.553 --> 39:46.111
You wanted to talk
about something?

39:51.460 --> 39:54.596
We've known each other
a long time, right? Twenty years?

39:54.596 --> 39:57.799
Not that long, but a long time.

39:57.799 --> 39:59.801
And in that time...

39:59.801 --> 40:04.329
we've grown close.

40:05.474 --> 40:08.143
Very close.
Do you know what I mean?

40:08.143 --> 40:10.771
- I think so.
- Good. So do I.

40:11.480 --> 40:14.074
So sometimes--

40:16.651 --> 40:18.118
could you excuse us?

40:23.492 --> 40:25.026
Sometimes...

40:25.026 --> 40:27.662
people think...

40:27.662 --> 40:30.332
they know how they feel
about each other...

40:30.332 --> 40:31.765
but they don't...

40:33.335 --> 40:34.802
until...

40:36.338 --> 40:37.828
until they do.

40:39.674 --> 40:41.107
I have a point.

40:42.344 --> 40:44.946
- Am I getting to it?
- Why don't you?

40:44.946 --> 40:48.177
Whatever it is you have to say
can't be that big a deal.

40:52.020 --> 40:56.684
''A big deal'' is a relative term.

41:10.472 --> 41:12.406
Who's that guy?

41:15.043 --> 41:18.246
It's George. I've told you
about George. He's my editor.

41:18.246 --> 41:20.510
What's he doing here?
You working this weekend?

41:24.219 --> 41:27.814
- He's here to be with me.
- Why?

41:29.224 --> 41:34.396
Because he's my friend.
He's my good friend.

41:34.396 --> 41:35.988
My best friend these days.

41:39.568 --> 41:41.729
You've been busy.

41:43.572 --> 41:47.872
So all of this
has been about George?

42:08.930 --> 42:10.932
I'm speechless.

42:10.932 --> 42:12.934
That's Jules.

42:12.934 --> 42:14.436
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

42:14.436 --> 42:16.471
What?

42:16.471 --> 42:20.271
I told him, puppy. If we're engaged,
we Shouldn't be ashamed of it.

42:22.410 --> 42:26.281
He's racing back to New York.
He just came in for a few hours...

42:26.281 --> 42:28.545
to fuck me.

42:33.455 --> 42:35.923
Takes a few hours.

42:38.793 --> 42:40.226
God.

42:43.131 --> 42:45.300
Give me your ring.
Give it to me!

42:45.300 --> 42:48.970
When you ask a girl to marry you,
you have to give an engagement ring.

42:48.970 --> 42:52.140
I can't believe you're doing this to me.
I've come all this way to help you.

42:52.140 --> 42:55.735
- You're insane!
- For one day find me irresistible.

43:04.219 --> 43:05.652
Stop it.

43:09.991 --> 43:11.788
Is something wrong?

43:14.162 --> 43:17.766
I guess it's just the way
you've always talked about George.

43:17.766 --> 43:21.302
It always seemed...

43:21.302 --> 43:24.005
seemed like--

43:24.005 --> 43:27.942
- It sounded like George was--
- Gay?

43:27.942 --> 43:29.432
Actually, yes.

43:31.179 --> 43:33.807
Common misconception.

43:35.517 --> 43:37.886
It is.

43:37.886 --> 43:43.381
George likes to pretend
that he's gay.

43:48.863 --> 43:50.888
And why would you do that?

43:52.367 --> 43:54.536
I find it attracts women.

43:54.536 --> 43:57.138
Indeed.
Worked for me.

43:57.138 --> 43:58.628
Big time.

44:02.711 --> 44:04.872
Right.

44:10.385 --> 44:12.819
Oh, my God.
Race you to the altar.

44:14.055 --> 44:16.124
- Underplay.
- Got it.

44:16.124 --> 44:18.226
I'm Jules' fiance, George.

44:18.226 --> 44:22.564
Just in town for a quick pre-conjugal
visit, it you catch my drift.

44:22.564 --> 44:23.997
I do.

44:25.233 --> 44:27.736
- You're going to humiliate me.
- Only if I can.

44:27.736 --> 44:30.371
Just one thing.
Stay away from--

44:30.371 --> 44:32.999
George! Oh, my God!

44:35.410 --> 44:39.748
- I don't know why I'm so carried away.
- Me neither.

44:39.748 --> 44:41.181
It's so--

44:42.917 --> 44:44.919
Against God's plan?

44:44.919 --> 44:47.889
No! It's just wonderful !

44:47.889 --> 44:50.187
It's so wonderful!

44:54.262 --> 44:55.695
Mom!

44:59.601 --> 45:03.104
- What?
- You have to meet George.

45:03.104 --> 45:05.607
You must be
Kimmy's little sister.

45:05.607 --> 45:09.210
Julianne's fiance.
They're going to be married.

45:09.210 --> 45:11.446
- What's going on?
- Julianne's getting married.

45:11.446 --> 45:13.982
- Why didn't you tell us?
- There hasn't been time.

45:13.982 --> 45:17.452
I wanted to. I wanted
to shout it from the rooftops...

45:17.452 --> 45:21.122
but Jules said,
''No, Pumpkin, no.

45:21.122 --> 45:22.624
This is Kimmy's day.

45:22.624 --> 45:25.058
Let's not take the attention
away from Kimmy.

45:26.127 --> 45:28.129
Dear, sweet...

45:28.129 --> 45:30.757
adorable,
chocolate-covered Kimmy.''

45:31.633 --> 45:34.402
Those were her very words.

45:34.402 --> 45:36.404
I think I'm gonna cry.

45:36.404 --> 45:38.306
Me too.

45:38.306 --> 45:41.142
This is so sweet of you
to come to our rehearsal.

45:41.142 --> 45:43.278
I insist you stay for lunch.

45:43.278 --> 45:45.246
- No, absolutely--
- Love to.

45:45.246 --> 45:48.917
Love the bag, love the shoes,
love everything. Love to.

45:48.917 --> 45:52.910
- Darling, what about your flight?
- Canceled.

45:59.160 --> 46:02.997
I can tell you this now,
but I was very worried about you.

46:02.997 --> 46:04.666
About me?

46:04.666 --> 46:07.602
All those stories that Michael told me
were hilarious...

46:07.602 --> 46:11.639
but all those broken relationships,
all those men.

46:11.639 --> 46:14.976
It must have hurt going through so many
guys and never finding the right one.

46:14.976 --> 46:18.707
She couldn't sit down for seven years
until she met teensy-weensy little me.

46:19.881 --> 46:23.214
And the man of your dreams
was always there.

46:25.687 --> 46:28.349
She's talking about me.

46:29.190 --> 46:30.859
Yes, Darling?

46:30.859 --> 46:35.196
- How did you and Julianne meet?
- George is my editor.

46:35.196 --> 46:37.532
But, Poopy,
we met a long time before that.

46:37.532 --> 46:41.302
Actually,
it's a very romantic story.

46:41.302 --> 46:44.372
would you like to tell it,
Sweet Pea?

46:44.372 --> 46:46.966
- It's private.
- Not anymore.

46:48.543 --> 46:51.713
I first met Julianne...

46:51.713 --> 46:53.977
in a mental institution.

46:55.383 --> 46:57.719
Julianne was there visiting
some French chef...

46:57.719 --> 46:59.888
she'd sent insane
with a bad review...

46:59.888 --> 47:02.356
and I was there
visiting Dionne Warwick.

47:03.858 --> 47:06.261
He thought he was Dionne Warwick.

47:06.261 --> 47:10.431
- Who is Dionne Warwick?
- Sacrilege, darling.

47:10.431 --> 47:12.100
She's Whitney Houston's aunt.

47:12.100 --> 47:14.402
She's very good
on the Psychic Friends Network.

47:14.402 --> 47:19.271
- Isn't she?
- Do you know the way to San Jose

47:25.413 --> 47:28.583
There I was with Dionne.
His real name, by the way, is Jerry.

47:28.583 --> 47:32.086
We were having a sing-along,
then suddenly...

47:32.086 --> 47:35.924
breezing through the doors
from the shock therapy room...

47:35.924 --> 47:37.592
I saw her.

47:37.592 --> 47:40.220
A vision in pink.

47:42.430 --> 47:45.099
- You don't wear pink.
- She does.

47:45.099 --> 47:47.602
Sometimes she does wear pink.

47:47.602 --> 47:50.371
- You do.
- I do.

47:50.371 --> 47:52.640
l said to Dionne...

47:52.640 --> 47:56.077
''Dionne, who is this vision?

47:56.077 --> 47:59.948
Surely, she must be the understudy
to some fabulous Broadway star.

47:59.948 --> 48:02.450
Look at her skin.
Who does her hair?''

48:02.450 --> 48:05.353
- In that moment, I knew.
- We don't all need to know--

48:05.353 --> 48:06.786
We do!

48:10.458 --> 48:14.128
- I'm very curious.
- They do.

48:14.128 --> 48:16.631
I knew...

48:16.631 --> 48:19.300
that someday
we'd end up like this:

48:19.300 --> 48:22.136
like some glittering...

48:22.136 --> 48:25.936
Doris Day-Rock Hudson
extravaganza.

48:27.575 --> 48:29.077
l said to Dionne...

48:29.077 --> 48:32.480
''Dionne, I'm in love.

48:32.480 --> 48:35.316
Could this siren love me?

48:35.316 --> 48:38.152
Are the gods that kind?''

48:38.152 --> 48:43.590
And Dionne turned to me,
opened her lovely eyes and said...

48:50.198 --> 48:51.756
What did she say?

48:54.168 --> 48:56.329
The moment I wake up

48:59.440 --> 49:02.377
Before I put on my makeup

49:02.377 --> 49:05.642
I say a little prayer for you

49:07.715 --> 49:10.183
While combing my hair now

49:11.686 --> 49:14.789
While wondering
what dress to wear now

49:14.789 --> 49:18.359
I say a little prayer for you

49:18.359 --> 49:21.963
Forever and ever
you'll stay in my heart

49:21.963 --> 49:23.631
And I will love you

49:23.631 --> 49:26.534
Forever and ever
We never will part

49:26.534 --> 49:28.036
Oh, how I love you

49:28.036 --> 49:31.039
Together forever
That's how it must be

49:31.039 --> 49:34.075
To live without you
would only mean

49:34.075 --> 49:36.811
Heartbreak for me

49:36.811 --> 49:38.972
Go, Granddaddy!

49:40.882 --> 49:43.373
l run for the bus, dear

49:44.485 --> 49:47.852
While riding
l think of us, dear

49:52.060 --> 49:54.221
At work I just take time

49:55.329 --> 49:58.492
And all through
my coffee break time

50:21.189 --> 50:23.521
My darling, believe me

50:24.759 --> 50:30.459
For me there is no one but you

50:31.566 --> 50:35.069
- Please love me too
- Answer his prayer

50:35.069 --> 50:38.106
- And I'm in love with you
- Answer his prayer now

50:38.106 --> 50:40.199
Answer my prayer, baby

50:41.442 --> 50:44.036
Say you love me too

51:08.002 --> 51:10.436
all right, now!

51:12.473 --> 51:15.143
- Heartbreak for you, actually.
- You've made your point.

51:15.143 --> 51:20.513
Get on your plane. I'll call at the turn
of the century when I've forgiven you.

51:22.817 --> 51:26.320
- It never would have worked out.
- Because it was dishonest.

51:26.320 --> 51:27.810
Different temperaments.

51:30.825 --> 51:33.692
Look, tell him you love him.

51:34.996 --> 51:36.930
Bite the bullet.

51:48.176 --> 51:50.011
What will he do?

51:50.011 --> 51:51.945
''Be Careful
Watch Your Step''

51:59.187 --> 52:01.856
He'll choose Kim.

52:01.856 --> 52:04.792
You'll stand beside her
at the wedding...

52:04.792 --> 52:07.955
kiss him good-bye
and go home.

52:09.730 --> 52:12.290
That's what you came here to do.

52:13.534 --> 52:15.468
So do it.

52:31.786 --> 52:35.056
George isn't my fiance, Michael.

52:35.056 --> 52:36.857
It's been over for ages...

52:36.857 --> 52:39.060
but he can't accept it.

52:39.060 --> 52:41.896
I'd built you up so much...

52:41.896 --> 52:45.166
l couldn't let him lose face
in front of you.

52:45.166 --> 52:50.661
He could never stack up to the one man
I measure everyone against.

52:56.911 --> 52:58.845
This is strange.

53:00.414 --> 53:02.917
I gotta tell you, when you--

53:02.917 --> 53:06.011
When you told me that you were
marrying George...

53:08.089 --> 53:11.616
I got this really strange--

53:14.595 --> 53:16.529
You were jealous?

53:22.536 --> 53:24.197
Crazy jealous.

53:26.307 --> 53:27.740
I'm sorry.

53:34.382 --> 53:37.579
Can we maybe spend some time alone
this afternoon?

53:41.088 --> 53:43.579
would that be ail right?

54:10.951 --> 54:15.790
I've been thinking a lot
the Last couple of days, about us.

54:15.790 --> 54:17.587
Have you?

54:21.529 --> 54:24.760
- There are a lot of memories.
- It's more than that.

54:27.301 --> 54:31.260
It's kind of embarrassing
to say it this way, but...

54:32.807 --> 54:35.910
you've sort of been,
you know...

54:35.910 --> 54:38.572
the woman in my life.

54:40.481 --> 54:43.551
You've been the man in mine.

54:43.551 --> 54:46.620
And I was thinking
this could be our last time...

54:46.620 --> 54:49.612
alone together, you know?

54:52.226 --> 54:54.762
Except for that hot affair
we'll have twice a year.

54:54.762 --> 54:56.696
Except for that.

55:04.205 --> 55:09.176
I mean, you commit
to this wedding...

55:09.176 --> 55:13.881
and then it seems
like there's this momentum...

55:13.881 --> 55:16.441
and then you forget
you chose it.

55:22.189 --> 55:24.425
You and I didn't--

55:24.425 --> 55:28.896
In our relationships
with other people...

55:28.896 --> 55:33.333
we didn't use
the word love a lot, did we?

55:36.470 --> 55:39.540
Kimmy says
it you love someone...

55:39.540 --> 55:42.109
you say it.

55:42.109 --> 55:44.270
You say it right then,
out loud.

55:45.579 --> 55:49.683
Otherwise,
the moment just--

55:49.683 --> 55:51.617
Passes you by.

56:14.175 --> 56:16.109
We don't even have a song.

56:17.411 --> 56:21.438
Kimmy and I don't have a song.

56:22.917 --> 56:24.885
Do you think that's a bad sign?

56:28.622 --> 56:30.724
Someday

56:30.724 --> 56:33.727
When I'm awfully low

56:33.727 --> 56:36.096
And the world is cold

56:36.096 --> 56:40.658
l will feel a glow
just thinking of you

56:42.536 --> 56:47.667
And the way you look tonight

56:48.542 --> 56:50.811
Is your dance card tilled?

56:50.811 --> 56:54.181
I'd have to check.
I keep it on Powerbook these days.

56:54.181 --> 56:56.115
Is that right?

56:59.253 --> 57:01.255
With each word

57:01.255 --> 57:04.247
Your tenderness grows

57:05.659 --> 57:09.652
Tearing my fears apart

57:11.765 --> 57:16.704
With each laugh
that wrinkles your nose

57:16.704 --> 57:20.538
Touches my foolish heart

57:59.346 --> 58:00.779
Excuse me.

58:04.218 --> 58:07.555
- I thought Michael was picking me up.
- I said I'd drop you at the stag.

58:07.555 --> 58:10.724
He's got a lot to do.
I'm the unofficial best man.

58:10.724 --> 58:13.294
Of course.

58:13.294 --> 58:18.299
Kim said when Michael turned the job
down that there was no friction.

58:18.299 --> 58:20.434
Friction? No.

58:20.434 --> 58:22.269
Good.

58:22.269 --> 58:25.072
I haven't caused a problem,
have I?

58:25.072 --> 58:27.404
You haven't. Nobody has.

58:29.076 --> 58:31.879
Listen,
you're just a little bit early.

58:31.879 --> 58:33.881
Actually, I needed
to make some phone calls.

58:33.881 --> 58:36.650
- Is it possible to use your office?
- of course.

58:36.650 --> 58:39.175
- At the end of the hall on the left.
- Thank you.

58:40.654 --> 58:42.952
Take your time.

58:50.764 --> 58:52.698
E-mall.

58:53.901 --> 58:57.234
''File'' ''New Letter'' ''Open'' ''Close''
New letter.

59:03.777 --> 59:08.382
To: Eric Isaacson...

59:08.382 --> 59:14.321
''Mall Out''
Senior editor, Sport Magazine.

59:14.321 --> 59:18.087
From: Walter Wallace.

59:20.160 --> 59:23.964
You can do this. It's easy.
Just do it fast, get it over with.

59:23.964 --> 59:25.898
It's like it never happened.

59:27.301 --> 59:31.105
Eric, I need a favor.

59:31.105 --> 59:35.409
My daughter's
every happiness...

59:35.409 --> 59:37.244
is in your hands.

59:37.244 --> 59:41.215
I have offered Mike O'Neal...

59:41.215 --> 59:43.917
my new son-in-Law...

59:43.917 --> 59:46.720
a great opportunity...

59:46.720 --> 59:48.922
in my company.

59:48.922 --> 59:52.426
To his own detriment...

59:52.426 --> 59:54.428
Michael will not...

59:54.428 --> 59:58.432
accept our offer...

59:58.432 --> 01:00:02.266
while he works for you.

01:00:26.994 --> 01:00:30.431
My daughter joins me
in this plea...

01:00:30.431 --> 01:00:34.101
for your cooperation.

01:00:34.101 --> 01:00:38.338
With gratitude, Walter.

01:00:38.338 --> 01:00:40.306
''Do You Wish To Send?''
''Yes'' ''No''

01:00:41.475 --> 01:00:44.569
Why would I send this?
He'd get tired.

01:00:47.281 --> 01:00:49.010
''Save For Later'' ''Delete''

01:00:52.853 --> 01:00:54.286
Save for later.

01:00:59.393 --> 01:01:01.261
It's not like I'm sending it.

01:01:01.261 --> 01:01:04.231
I'm just saving it
for a few hours...

01:01:04.231 --> 01:01:07.101
till we come back here and...

01:01:07.101 --> 01:01:08.936
Michael can see it.

01:01:08.936 --> 01:01:11.268
Perfectly harmless.

01:01:50.744 --> 01:01:52.177
''Wallace Company''

01:02:03.590 --> 01:02:07.094
Send out this, this,
not this, this.

01:02:07.094 --> 01:02:09.062
That's it.

01:02:09.062 --> 01:02:13.600
I'm holding tour or five e-malls
I wrote over lunch. Send those too.

01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:17.004
- Yes, sir.
- Bye.

01:02:17.004 --> 01:02:18.904
all set?

01:02:20.340 --> 01:02:22.910
I can't believe this!
Did you try every key?

01:02:22.910 --> 01:02:25.312
It's no big deal.
She just gave us the wrong keys.

01:02:25.312 --> 01:02:29.283
There's got to be a janitor
or a guard...

01:02:29.283 --> 01:02:32.853
or a cleaning woman
or, you know, some kind of--

01:02:32.853 --> 01:02:37.658
Somebody has to be in this building!
I need a brick.

01:02:37.658 --> 01:02:39.956
What's the big deal
about getting this tile tonight?

01:02:41.428 --> 01:02:43.797
- I'm up against a deadline.
- Me too.

01:02:43.797 --> 01:02:46.733
- I'm getting married tomorrow.
- That's my point!

01:02:46.733 --> 01:02:49.169
Everybody will be busy
with more important things...

01:02:49.169 --> 01:02:51.738
and this is really my last chance.

01:02:51.738 --> 01:02:54.775
If I could just get up to Walter's
office, they're by the computer.

01:02:54.775 --> 01:02:58.111
Then I could just e-mail
those figures right out now!

01:02:58.111 --> 01:02:59.880
Tomorrow's Sunday.

01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:01.949
Nobody's doing business.

01:03:01.949 --> 01:03:06.477
Monday morning, crack of dawn,
Walter will walk you right up there.

01:03:07.788 --> 01:03:09.722
Give it up, kid.

01:03:11.291 --> 01:03:12.724
Can't win them all.

01:03:26.740 --> 01:03:28.173
Good night.

01:03:36.683 --> 01:03:40.449
This thing mean
that much to you?

01:03:43.023 --> 01:03:45.192
We'll use the phone
in your room.

01:03:45.192 --> 01:03:47.527
Walter's probably not even asleep.

01:03:47.527 --> 01:03:50.530
- I'll drive you up there.
- Thank you !

01:03:50.530 --> 01:03:53.834
We'll get the right key,
and we'll go back to the office.

01:03:53.834 --> 01:03:56.603
If I fall asleep on the altar tomorrow,
you'd better be there.

01:03:56.603 --> 01:03:58.505
I'll be there.

01:03:58.505 --> 01:04:03.677
These are all from Eric.
This fax is from Eric too.

01:04:03.677 --> 01:04:06.246
My wedding. You'd think my boss
would leave me alone.

01:04:06.246 --> 01:04:08.180
Maybe it's Congratulations.

01:04:18.959 --> 01:04:20.688
What is it?

01:04:27.501 --> 01:04:30.604
''Mike, I can't believe I'm doing this to
you on the night before your wedding...

01:04:30.604 --> 01:04:34.908
but I think you need
and deserve...

01:04:34.908 --> 01:04:36.842
to know what
you're marrying into.

01:04:41.148 --> 01:04:44.709
I received the following e-mall
this afternoon:

01:04:46.420 --> 01:04:49.878
'Eric, I need a favor.
My daughter's every--'''

01:04:52.059 --> 01:04:54.461
Isabelle, I need to talk to Kim.

01:04:54.461 --> 01:04:56.997
- Is anything wrong?
- No, I'm just tired.

01:04:56.997 --> 01:04:59.693
Please put her on.
Thanks.

01:05:03.236 --> 01:05:05.170
could you give me a minute?

01:05:06.974 --> 01:05:08.407
Please?

01:05:56.323 --> 01:05:59.121
Excuse me, miss.
Are you locked out?

01:06:02.396 --> 01:06:05.797
Just stepped out.
It's a no-smoking room.

01:06:08.168 --> 01:06:10.404
It's a nonsmoking floor too.

01:06:10.404 --> 01:06:14.207
Maybe you could go down
to the lobby.

01:06:14.207 --> 01:06:16.232
Why don't you have me arrested?

01:06:18.478 --> 01:06:20.113
I mean it.

01:06:20.113 --> 01:06:23.810
I am a dangerous, criminal person.

01:06:26.186 --> 01:06:28.814
I do bad things
to honest people.

01:06:31.258 --> 01:06:33.960
You can make a citizen's arrest.
I wouldn't struggle.

01:06:33.960 --> 01:06:36.451
It'd be like getting AI Capone
on tax evasion.

01:06:44.938 --> 01:06:47.168
Can I help you, miss?

01:06:52.479 --> 01:06:54.640
Do you smoke, Richard?

01:06:55.382 --> 01:06:57.951
Yes, I do, but--

01:06:57.951 --> 01:06:59.748
It's a nonsmoking floor.

01:07:02.989 --> 01:07:04.923
But you know what?

01:07:26.913 --> 01:07:32.249
You know,
my grandmother always said...

01:07:34.354 --> 01:07:37.323
''This too shall pass.''

01:07:40.727 --> 01:07:42.160
Thanks, Richard.

01:08:07.654 --> 01:08:10.991
l want you to quit this shit.

01:08:10.991 --> 01:08:12.424
It'll kill you.

01:08:16.962 --> 01:08:18.395
What happened?

01:08:20.934 --> 01:08:23.803
It's over.
She denied it.

01:08:23.803 --> 01:08:26.740
She said
I was crazy and paranoid.

01:08:26.740 --> 01:08:29.776
A bad combination.

01:08:29.776 --> 01:08:31.310
There's a big...

01:08:31.310 --> 01:08:35.015
brunch tomorrow morning
at her parents' house.

01:08:35.015 --> 01:08:37.779
She said,
''How could I call it oft?

01:08:40.086 --> 01:08:42.077
What am I supposed
to tell everyone?''

01:08:43.857 --> 01:08:46.189
It's for the best.
It really is.

01:08:47.027 --> 01:08:48.961
She was right.

01:08:51.163 --> 01:08:53.131
I am crazy...

01:08:55.635 --> 01:08:58.126
to tall for someone
I hardly knew.

01:09:03.443 --> 01:09:05.343
I'm so glad you're here.

01:09:12.484 --> 01:09:15.750
Have you still got that ring?

01:09:27.167 --> 01:09:30.000
I tried it on,
and it won't come off.

01:10:08.475 --> 01:10:12.536
Why don't we take a walk
or have some food sent up?

01:10:15.415 --> 01:10:17.651
I just want to be alone.

01:10:17.651 --> 01:10:19.986
Is that okay?

01:10:19.986 --> 01:10:21.419
Sure.

01:10:24.524 --> 01:10:29.663
Maybe I'll go back to New York
for awhile and hang with you.

01:10:29.663 --> 01:10:34.467
Eric will understand.
Or we could go somewhere...

01:10:34.467 --> 01:10:35.900
if you want.

01:10:37.370 --> 01:10:40.066
''If San Antonio
sweeps Sacramento--''

01:10:41.508 --> 01:10:43.442
I've never been to Texas.

01:11:32.525 --> 01:11:34.459
''Brown''

01:11:53.380 --> 01:11:54.813
You what?

01:12:17.470 --> 01:12:19.495
- Can I try that?
- Sure.

01:12:30.283 --> 01:12:32.342
- Excuse me.
- Good Luck.

01:12:35.488 --> 01:12:37.791
So this is your basic
call-off-the-wedding party?

01:12:37.791 --> 01:12:41.494
I came here to confront everybody.
I won't slink away like some coward.

01:12:41.494 --> 01:12:44.264
Besides, she hasn't told anyone.
l don't know what I'm supposed to do.

01:12:44.264 --> 01:12:48.360
There is a wedding at 6:00.

01:12:55.141 --> 01:13:00.340
Have you changed your mind?
Do you want to marry Kimmy?

01:13:03.616 --> 01:13:07.143
I made a decision.
It's over.

01:13:09.055 --> 01:13:10.989
I'll go tell them.

01:13:13.159 --> 01:13:17.255
First,
do you think she's all right?

01:13:18.198 --> 01:13:20.393
could you
check on her for me?

01:13:24.304 --> 01:13:27.296
These are the most beautiful flowers
I've ever seen.

01:13:31.044 --> 01:13:32.477
How is he?

01:13:35.248 --> 01:13:37.917
He's sort of wondering...

01:13:37.917 --> 01:13:41.216
why you haven't told your parents
that the wedding's oft.

01:13:42.856 --> 01:13:46.626
I don't know. I'm still hoping
for a miracle, I suppose.

01:13:46.626 --> 01:13:50.196
How could he think that
my father and I would do such a thing?

01:13:50.196 --> 01:13:53.290
I only minored in psych,
you understand, but...

01:13:55.068 --> 01:13:58.238
maybe Michael couldn't commit
to this marriage...

01:13:58.238 --> 01:14:00.974
so he created...

01:14:00.974 --> 01:14:02.475
a delusion...

01:14:02.475 --> 01:14:05.445
produced an unconscious,
psychosomatic...

01:14:05.445 --> 01:14:07.379
manifestation of--

01:14:10.116 --> 01:14:11.708
I'm better with food.

01:14:14.254 --> 01:14:18.892
You're Michael.
You're in a fancy French restaurant.

01:14:18.892 --> 01:14:22.295
You order...

01:14:22.295 --> 01:14:24.388
crème brulee for dessert.

01:14:25.465 --> 01:14:28.301
It's beautiful. It's sweet.

01:14:28.301 --> 01:14:32.038
It's irritatingly perfect.

01:14:32.038 --> 01:14:34.707
Suddenly, Michael realizes...

01:14:34.707 --> 01:14:37.443
he doesn't want crème brulee.

01:14:37.443 --> 01:14:42.278
- He wants something else.
- What does he want?

01:14:44.584 --> 01:14:47.314
- Jell-O.
- ''Jell-O''?

01:14:48.521 --> 01:14:52.892
- Why Jell-O?
- He's comfortable with Jell-O.

01:14:52.892 --> 01:14:56.195
Jell-O makes him comfortable.

01:14:56.195 --> 01:14:58.398
I realize
compared to crème brulee...

01:14:58.398 --> 01:15:01.367
it's Jell-O,
but maybe that's what he needs.

01:15:03.403 --> 01:15:04.961
I could be Jell-O.

01:15:06.606 --> 01:15:09.275
Crème brulee
can never be Jell-O.

01:15:09.275 --> 01:15:12.045
You could never be Jell-O.

01:15:12.045 --> 01:15:15.315
- I have to be Jell-O.
- You'll never be Jell-O.

01:15:15.315 --> 01:15:20.520
Tell your parents. lf you're waiting
for that ''do you take this man'' part...

01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:22.715
- it's considered poor form.
- I love him.

01:15:23.923 --> 01:15:26.326
Whatever delusions
I drove Michael to...

01:15:26.326 --> 01:15:28.328
there's truth
at the heart of it.

01:15:28.328 --> 01:15:31.664
I want him to work
for my father.

01:15:31.664 --> 01:15:34.827
I want to stay in school,
and I want a life of my own.

01:15:36.035 --> 01:15:39.801
Please, tell him it's my fault
and I love him.

01:15:41.240 --> 01:15:43.538
You're the only person
that I trust.

01:15:49.616 --> 01:15:52.346
- I'll be right back.
- Thank you.

01:16:05.465 --> 01:16:07.667
How is she?

01:16:07.667 --> 01:16:11.034
- Knock it off!
- Yes, sir!

01:16:13.039 --> 01:16:15.441
- I asked you--
- She admits that it's her fault.

01:16:15.441 --> 01:16:18.069
Totally, completely,
inexcusably her fault.

01:16:21.481 --> 01:16:23.449
Do you think
she still loves me?

01:16:26.886 --> 01:16:30.490
Love is a strong word...

01:16:30.490 --> 01:16:33.059
and I don't know that
I'm necessarily qualified--

01:16:33.059 --> 01:16:37.163
I guess I wouldn't be totally oft base
it I said that, in her way...

01:16:37.163 --> 01:16:39.961
she does possess
strong feelings--

01:16:45.705 --> 01:16:47.639
Sure, she does.

01:16:48.541 --> 01:16:50.543
She's crazy about you.

01:16:50.543 --> 01:16:54.570
You fill up my senses

01:16:55.548 --> 01:16:59.211
Like a night in the forest

01:17:00.653 --> 01:17:06.059
Like the mountains
in springtime

01:17:06.059 --> 01:17:08.728
Like a walk in the rain

01:17:08.728 --> 01:17:11.060
Tell her I'll marry her
at 6:00...

01:17:12.131 --> 01:17:14.065
it she'll still have me.

01:17:16.302 --> 01:17:18.133
Please.

01:17:19.639 --> 01:17:24.210
Like a sleepy blue ocean

01:17:24.210 --> 01:17:27.202
I'll be right back.

01:17:31.651 --> 01:17:36.679
Come love me again

01:17:47.900 --> 01:17:49.834
What did he say?

01:17:55.508 --> 01:17:56.941
He said...

01:18:00.480 --> 01:18:01.913
''Marry me.''

01:18:06.552 --> 01:18:10.156
Thank God you were here.

01:18:10.156 --> 01:18:12.358
I got so contused.

01:18:12.358 --> 01:18:13.791
It happens.

01:18:14.961 --> 01:18:16.394
Got a minute?

01:18:18.431 --> 01:18:19.864
What's up?

01:18:31.577 --> 01:18:34.847
I have to say this quick or I'll
just have this massive coronary...

01:18:34.847 --> 01:18:37.984
and then you'll never hear it,
and you have to.

01:18:37.984 --> 01:18:42.955
This is, by far, the dumbest thing
I've ever done in my entire life.

01:18:42.955 --> 01:18:48.361
So dumb, in fact, that I can't.
But I'm gonna.

01:18:48.361 --> 01:18:49.885
What's wrong?

01:18:57.603 --> 01:19:01.140
I love you.
I've loved you for nine years.

01:19:01.140 --> 01:19:05.545
I've just been too arrogant
and scared to realize it.

01:19:05.545 --> 01:19:07.780
Now I'm just scared.

01:19:07.780 --> 01:19:11.651
I realize this comes
at a very inopportune time...

01:19:11.651 --> 01:19:15.747
but I really have this gigantic
favor to ask of you.

01:19:18.124 --> 01:19:21.027
Choose me. Marry me.

01:19:21.027 --> 01:19:24.019
Let me make you happy.

01:19:25.231 --> 01:19:27.600
That sounds like three favors,
doesn't it?

01:19:27.600 --> 01:19:29.033
But--

01:20:09.342 --> 01:20:12.140
- Lovely together.
- Aren't they?

01:20:15.915 --> 01:20:19.817
That's our maid of honor.
She's from New York.

01:20:34.166 --> 01:20:38.571
''Floral Design/Special Events''
Michael, wait!

01:20:38.571 --> 01:20:40.664
Please! You'll never catch her!

01:20:43.910 --> 01:20:46.012
Doesn't anybody
leave their car unlocked?

01:20:46.012 --> 01:20:49.081
Nobody trusts anybody anymore?

01:20:49.081 --> 01:20:51.117
A good Samaritan.

01:20:51.117 --> 01:20:53.719
''Auto Memory Storing''
There's just

01:20:53.719 --> 01:20:55.788
Too little of

01:20:55.788 --> 01:20:57.823
What the world needs now
''Bakery''

01:20:57.823 --> 01:20:59.492
Come back here!

01:20:59.492 --> 01:21:03.262
''Shy tendrils of russet pleasure...

01:21:03.262 --> 01:21:06.595
began their unbidden journey.

01:21:07.633 --> 01:21:09.135
She moaned.

01:21:09.135 --> 01:21:13.706
The tonnage of years of anguish,
sacrifice, mingling with--''

01:21:13.706 --> 01:21:16.142
It is not going well !

01:21:16.142 --> 01:21:20.413
This is what comes of telling the truth
or even part of it!

01:21:20.413 --> 01:21:23.649
- Getting what you deserve isn't fair.
- Where are you?

01:21:23.649 --> 01:21:28.321
I have stolen a bread van, and I'm
chasing Michael down Michigan Avenue!

01:21:28.321 --> 01:21:30.756
This is all your fault!
I told him the truth !

01:21:30.756 --> 01:21:32.758
I said that I loved him,
and I kissed him.

01:21:32.758 --> 01:21:35.428
- This is what's happened!
- Jules, a question.

01:21:35.428 --> 01:21:38.664
When you kissed Michael,
did he kiss you back?

01:21:38.664 --> 01:21:40.666
What do you mean?
We were lip to lip!

01:21:40.666 --> 01:21:44.762
Was there anything there leading you
to believe this chase will end happily?

01:21:46.038 --> 01:21:48.040
That's beside the point.
We were interrupted.

01:21:48.040 --> 01:21:50.776
- Who interrupted you?
- Kimmy! She ruined everything!

01:21:50.776 --> 01:21:53.279
And Michael started chasing her
before he could answer me.

01:21:53.279 --> 01:21:54.914
Michael's chasing Kimmy?

01:21:54.914 --> 01:21:56.782
You're chasing Michael?

01:21:56.782 --> 01:21:59.852
Who's chasing you?
Nobody. Get it?

01:21:59.852 --> 01:22:01.420
There's your answer: Kimmy.

01:22:01.420 --> 01:22:03.723
Jules, you are not the one!

01:22:03.723 --> 01:22:07.860
Now, for God's sake,
the wedding is at 6:00 p.m.

01:22:07.860 --> 01:22:11.318
You have a small, but distinct, window
of opportunity to do the right thing.

01:22:30.116 --> 01:22:32.050
''Exit'' ''Canal St.''

01:22:44.730 --> 01:22:46.163
all aboard!

01:22:52.705 --> 01:22:54.138
Excuse me.

01:23:53.065 --> 01:23:55.501
I have a confession to make.

01:23:55.501 --> 01:23:57.867
Another confession.

01:24:03.042 --> 01:24:07.877
Besides that I love you,
this is even worse.

01:24:14.653 --> 01:24:18.589
The e-mall that Walter sent
to your boss--

01:24:23.329 --> 01:24:25.320
I wrote that.

01:24:28.434 --> 01:24:31.198
I'm the bad guy.

01:24:32.204 --> 01:24:33.706
Are you crazy?

01:24:33.706 --> 01:24:36.903
Are you completely insane?

01:24:38.110 --> 01:24:41.705
l mean, Jules,
how could you do that?

01:24:43.182 --> 01:24:47.219
It wasn't supposed
to get sent.

01:24:47.219 --> 01:24:49.517
I just wanted you
to get mad at Kimmy.

01:24:52.892 --> 01:24:54.325
God.

01:24:57.196 --> 01:25:00.633
I have done nothing
but underhanded, despicable...

01:25:00.633 --> 01:25:04.899
not even terribly imaginative things
since I got here.

01:25:13.078 --> 01:25:17.947
I was just trying to win you...

01:25:19.285 --> 01:25:21.810
to win you back.

01:25:22.888 --> 01:25:25.288
But that doesn't excuse
any of it.

01:25:26.659 --> 01:25:28.149
I'm pond scum.

01:25:30.863 --> 01:25:32.498
Lower, actually.

01:25:32.498 --> 01:25:36.902
I'm like the fungus that feeds
on pond scum.

01:25:36.902 --> 01:25:38.426
Lower.

01:25:41.173 --> 01:25:44.176
The pus that infects the mucus...

01:25:44.176 --> 01:25:48.112
that cruds up the fungus
that feeds on the pond scum.

01:25:56.288 --> 01:25:58.483
On the other hand...

01:26:01.293 --> 01:26:02.726
thank you...

01:26:04.563 --> 01:26:06.758
for loving me that much.

01:26:07.833 --> 01:26:09.535
That way...

01:26:09.535 --> 01:26:11.469
it's pretty flattering.

01:26:13.005 --> 01:26:15.940
Except it makes me fungus.

01:26:16.742 --> 01:26:20.508
That part I knew.

01:26:30.823 --> 01:26:32.256
God.

01:26:36.095 --> 01:26:38.529
I'm glad you didn't get
on that train.

01:26:41.467 --> 01:26:43.628
I came here looking for her.

01:26:46.105 --> 01:26:50.405
- Why would she be here?
- This is where I proposed.

01:26:53.512 --> 01:26:57.549
l had to cover a game in Milwaukee,
and she saw me off.

01:26:57.549 --> 01:27:01.212
The train was starting
to leave and...

01:27:03.055 --> 01:27:06.218
I jumped up on the step
and I held the handle...

01:27:07.293 --> 01:27:10.062
and without...

01:27:10.062 --> 01:27:13.429
a thought in my head,
I just shouted, ''Marry me.''

01:27:15.701 --> 01:27:21.401
The train was pulling out,
and she just suddenly screamed, ''Yes!''

01:27:23.575 --> 01:27:25.099
Just once.

01:27:26.845 --> 01:27:28.779
And blew me a kiss.

01:27:41.327 --> 01:27:43.261
It would've been
a nice wedding.

01:27:45.698 --> 01:27:48.734
You can't believe
that you've lost her.

01:27:48.734 --> 01:27:53.505
You will find her, and you'll look
into her eyes and see all that love.

01:27:53.505 --> 01:27:58.377
I just hope that it's soon.
Or else I'd hate to be you at 6:00.

01:27:58.377 --> 01:28:00.346
Just wait.

01:28:00.346 --> 01:28:02.181
We'll split up.

01:28:02.181 --> 01:28:05.851
You will go to every romantic place
the two of you have...

01:28:05.851 --> 01:28:11.256
and I will go someplace brilliant,
and we'll find her.

01:28:11.256 --> 01:28:13.747
We will find her.

01:28:17.429 --> 01:28:19.798
Wallace egregious residence,
Mandy speaking.

01:28:19.798 --> 01:28:22.234
it’s Jules.
Have you gotten a call from Kimmy?

01:28:22.234 --> 01:28:25.404
She slipped out, the little monkey,
during the commotion.

01:28:25.404 --> 01:28:27.339
''Commotion''?

01:28:27.339 --> 01:28:31.610
My sister was licking an ice sculpture,
and her tongue froze right to it.

01:28:31.610 --> 01:28:34.012
And that's a commotion?

01:28:34.012 --> 01:28:36.014
It's a sculpture of the David.

01:28:36.014 --> 01:28:37.950
So Kimmy would be--

01:28:37.950 --> 01:28:41.320
She's probably with Michael
doing the nasty.

01:28:41.320 --> 01:28:44.256
Either that or crying in her nachos
down at Comiskey Park.

01:28:44.256 --> 01:28:46.291
- Excuse me?
- I had this crank call...

01:28:46.291 --> 01:28:48.627
from some guy who says he saw her
in the luxury box.

01:28:48.627 --> 01:28:51.697
- Right.
- What would a bride be doing--

01:28:51.697 --> 01:28:53.699
Can you bring my dress
to the church?

01:28:53.699 --> 01:28:56.435
I have to pick something up
for the ceremony.

01:28:56.435 --> 01:28:58.835
Don't forget to shave now.

01:29:00.773 --> 01:29:03.008
Here we go.
Here's the hair dryer.

01:29:03.008 --> 01:29:05.077
There we go.

01:29:05.077 --> 01:29:09.013
It's going to be okay.
Please, no pictures.

01:29:12.851 --> 01:29:14.284
''Federal Express''

01:29:27.132 --> 01:29:29.601
I know you're in here.
The guard saw you come in.

01:29:29.601 --> 01:29:32.365
Just leave me alone,
you bitch!

01:29:39.011 --> 01:29:41.914
Who the hell
do you think you are?

01:29:41.914 --> 01:29:44.349
- Cat fight!
- You came here...

01:29:44.349 --> 01:29:48.287
pretending to be my friend,
and I made you my maid of honor!

01:29:48.287 --> 01:29:51.957
Who asked you to do that?
You knew me what, eight minutes?

01:29:51.957 --> 01:29:54.626
Michael trusted you,
so I trusted you.

01:29:54.626 --> 01:29:58.363
You wanted to keep me close.
You didn't trust me for a second.

01:29:58.363 --> 01:30:00.833
- I was right!
- of course you were right.

01:30:00.833 --> 01:30:03.936
- But that's not my fault.
- You kissed him!

01:30:03.936 --> 01:30:05.938
- At my parents' house!
- That's cold.

01:30:05.938 --> 01:30:07.539
On my wedding day!

01:30:07.539 --> 01:30:09.341
- Bitch.
- Tramp.

01:30:09.341 --> 01:30:11.343
Shut up!

01:30:11.343 --> 01:30:13.779
Now I love this man,
and there is no way...

01:30:13.779 --> 01:30:19.274
I'm going to give him up to some
two-faced, big-haired food critic!

01:30:22.888 --> 01:30:25.624
all right.
Okay, all right!

01:30:25.624 --> 01:30:27.057
I kissed him.

01:30:28.527 --> 01:30:31.928
I tried to steal him.

01:30:36.268 --> 01:30:37.701
I lost.

01:30:43.308 --> 01:30:47.904
He doesn't love me.
He loves you.

01:30:54.953 --> 01:30:58.445
I haven't done much that I'm proud of
the last three days.

01:31:01.860 --> 01:31:05.163
I'd like to take you
to the church...

01:31:05.163 --> 01:31:08.133
so you can walk down
that aisle...

01:31:08.133 --> 01:31:10.624
and marry the man
of our dreams.

01:31:12.271 --> 01:31:14.796
Because he sure wants
to marry you.

01:33:08.086 --> 01:33:12.958
So raise our glasses and wish Mike
and Kim every happiness...

01:33:12.958 --> 01:33:15.290
for a long and happy life
together...

01:33:16.595 --> 01:33:19.723
filled with happiness.

01:33:22.768 --> 01:33:26.101
- I guess that's it.
- To the bride and groom.

01:33:32.878 --> 01:33:35.972
Now let's hear from the maid of honor,
the lovely Julianne.

01:33:46.425 --> 01:33:48.791
I had the strangest dream.

01:33:50.529 --> 01:33:55.228
I dreamt that some psychopath was
trying to break the two of you up.

01:34:01.039 --> 01:34:05.635
Luckily, I woke up and I see...

01:34:07.345 --> 01:34:11.281
that the world
is just as it Should be...

01:34:14.653 --> 01:34:16.985
for my best friend...

01:34:18.523 --> 01:34:20.650
has won the best woman.

01:34:31.470 --> 01:34:33.734
I didn't get you a gift.

01:34:35.941 --> 01:34:37.209
However,
this is on loan...

01:34:37.209 --> 01:34:40.645
However,
this is on loan...

01:34:43.281 --> 01:34:46.478
until you two
find your song.

01:34:50.689 --> 01:34:53.920
Someday

01:34:55.894 --> 01:34:59.057
When I'm awfully low

01:35:00.265 --> 01:35:03.291
When the world is cold

01:35:04.903 --> 01:35:08.240
l will feel a glow

01:35:08.240 --> 01:35:14.012
Just thinking of you

01:35:14.012 --> 01:35:17.971
And the way you look

01:35:19.050 --> 01:35:20.540
Tonight

01:35:22.287 --> 01:35:27.247
Oh, but you're lovely

01:35:29.294 --> 01:35:32.161
With your smile so warm

01:35:34.533 --> 01:35:37.730
And your cheeks so soft

01:35:39.070 --> 01:35:42.874
There is nothing for me

01:35:42.874 --> 01:35:47.208
But to love you

01:35:48.613 --> 01:35:51.844
Just the way you look

01:35:52.818 --> 01:35:54.718
Tonight

01:36:07.499 --> 01:36:10.400
- It's mine!
- I don't think so!

01:36:14.472 --> 01:36:16.064
I got it!

01:36:45.303 --> 01:36:46.827
Bye.

01:37:34.786 --> 01:37:37.188
Hey, gorgeous,
having a good time?

01:37:37.188 --> 01:37:40.492
Not particularly,
but I did what I came to do.

01:37:40.492 --> 01:37:42.694
What? You split them up?

01:37:42.694 --> 01:37:44.562
No, I said good-bye.

01:37:44.562 --> 01:37:47.232
Good girl.
I'm proud of you.

01:37:47.232 --> 01:37:49.601
Be prouder still
if you were dancing.

01:37:49.601 --> 01:37:51.836
I have big plans for dancing.

01:37:51.836 --> 01:37:55.807
Just give me 30, 35 years.

01:37:55.807 --> 01:37:57.609
The misery...

01:37:57.609 --> 01:37:59.144
the exquisite tragedy.

01:37:59.144 --> 01:38:02.113
The Susan Hayward of it all.

01:38:02.113 --> 01:38:05.717
l can picture you there sitting alone
at your table in your lavender gown.

01:38:05.717 --> 01:38:07.285
Did I tell you
my gown was Lavender?

01:38:07.285 --> 01:38:10.422
Hair swept up.
Haven't touched your cake.

01:38:10.422 --> 01:38:14.793
Probably drumming your fingernails
on the white linen tablecloth...

01:38:14.793 --> 01:38:16.962
the way you do when you're
really feeling down.

01:38:16.962 --> 01:38:20.465
Perhaps looking at those nails thinking:
''I should've stopped...

01:38:20.465 --> 01:38:24.102
my evil plotting to have that manicure,
but it's too late now. "

01:38:24.102 --> 01:38:27.806
I didn't tell you
my dress was lavender.

01:38:27.806 --> 01:38:29.874
Suddenly, a familiar song.

01:38:29.874 --> 01:38:33.241
The moment I wake up

01:38:34.946 --> 01:38:37.972
And you're off your chair
in one, exquisite movement...

01:38:40.685 --> 01:38:43.922
wondering, searching,
sniffing the wind...

01:38:43.922 --> 01:38:46.424
like a dapple deer.

01:38:46.424 --> 01:38:48.560
Has God heard your little prayer?

01:38:48.560 --> 01:38:51.196
Will Cinderella dance again?

01:38:51.196 --> 01:38:55.394
And then, suddenly,
the crowds part...

01:38:57.102 --> 01:38:58.535
and there he is:

01:38:59.871 --> 01:39:02.974
sleek, stylish...

01:39:02.974 --> 01:39:05.744
radiant with charisma.

01:39:05.744 --> 01:39:08.880
Bizarrely,
he's on the telephone.

01:39:08.880 --> 01:39:11.440
But then, so are you.

01:39:13.918 --> 01:39:15.943
And he comes towards you...

01:39:17.222 --> 01:39:19.156
the moves of a jungle cat.

01:39:20.392 --> 01:39:22.792
Although you quite correctly sense
that he is...

01:39:24.162 --> 01:39:25.797
...

01:39:25.797 --> 01:39:29.324
like most devastatingly handsome
single men of his age are...

01:39:31.069 --> 01:39:34.095
you think, what the hell...

01:39:35.940 --> 01:39:38.410
life goes on.

01:39:38.410 --> 01:39:41.112
Maybe there won't be marriage.

01:39:41.112 --> 01:39:43.307
Maybe there won't be sex.

01:39:44.649 --> 01:39:48.483
But, by God,
there'll be dancing.

01:40:07.038 --> 01:40:09.370
Bond. Jane Bond.
