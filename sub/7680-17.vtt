01:22.148 --> 01:24.150
MacGYVER:
One of the problems
of flying a jet

01:24.651 --> 01:27.654
is that you don't have a lot
of time to admire the scenery.

01:28.154 --> 01:29.656
I had just entered
Pakistani airspace,

01:30.156 --> 01:32.659
and already, the Afghan border
was coming up fast.

01:32.659 --> 01:36.663
One of our early satellites
fell out of orbit,

01:36.663 --> 01:38.164
and wouldn't you know it?

01:38.665 --> 01:41.668
It landed
just inside Afghanistan.

01:41.668 --> 01:45.171
Now, the satellite has
a small capsule in it

01:45.171 --> 01:46.673
with a lot of classified data

01:46.673 --> 01:49.175
we didn't want the Russians
to get their hands on.

01:49.175 --> 01:51.177
And it's funny
when you remember

01:51.678 --> 01:53.179
that we brought
those early satellites

01:53.680 --> 01:57.183
back to Earth
with wings on 'em.

01:57.183 --> 01:59.686
(monitor beeping)

01:59.686 --> 02:01.187
He's crossed the border, sir.

02:01.688 --> 02:03.189
n.
He's over Afghanista

02:03.189 --> 02:04.190
So far...

02:04.190 --> 02:05.191
So good.

02:17.704 --> 02:19.706
(alarm blaring)

02:19.706 --> 02:21.708
(shouting in Russian)

02:26.713 --> 02:28.715
MacGYVER:
I can be pretty sure
of one thing.

02:28.715 --> 02:30.717
My arrival'll be causing

02:30.717 --> 02:33.720
more than just a little
activity down below.

02:35.722 --> 02:38.224
(alarm blaring)

02:38.224 --> 02:39.726
(speaking Russian)

02:41.728 --> 02:43.229
Warning

02:43.229 --> 02:44.230
to Unidentified Aircraft.

02:44.230 --> 02:46.733
You are violating
Afghani airspace.

02:46.733 --> 02:50.737
Identify yourself
on frequency 1-1-6.

02:50.737 --> 02:53.239
Couple of more minutes,
and he's there.

03:09.756 --> 03:12.258
(woman screams)

03:12.258 --> 03:13.760
(man laughing)
WOMAN:
No! No!

03:13.760 --> 03:15.261
Ah, aha, yes!
No! Please!

03:15.762 --> 03:17.764
(woman screaming)

03:17.764 --> 03:19.265
Come here.

03:19.265 --> 03:20.767
No!

03:21.267 --> 03:23.770
WOMAN:
Don't do this to me!
Please!

03:23.770 --> 03:26.272
RUSSIAN MAN:
Unidentified aircraft,
you have been warned.

03:26.272 --> 03:29.275
Punitive action
is being initiated now.

03:32.278 --> 03:34.781
s.
Prepare to
fire missile

03:34.781 --> 03:35.782
Fire one.

03:44.290 --> 03:45.291
Fire three.

03:52.799 --> 03:55.301
Missiles... headin
g right for him.

03:55.301 --> 03:56.302
How long?

03:56.302 --> 03:58.304
(beeping)

03:58.805 --> 04:02.308
MacGYVER:
I think the fact I didn't reply
annoyed him just a little.

04:02.308 --> 04:04.811
The sky was suddenly full
of unfriendly fire.

04:11.317 --> 04:12.318
(beeping)

04:13.820 --> 04:15.822
I was thinking
it was about time to leave.

04:18.324 --> 04:19.325
(beeping)

04:28.334 --> 04:29.335
They shot down

04:29.335 --> 04:31.337
another plane.

04:37.343 --> 04:38.845
r.
He's out, si

04:41.347 --> 04:45.351
MacGYVER:
Well, scratch one obsolete jet.

04:46.853 --> 04:49.856
I can just hear
old Pete Thornton saying,

04:49.856 --> 04:52.358
"Why does
he always have to wait

04:52.358 --> 04:54.861
till the last possible second?"

04:55.361 --> 04:58.364
He always waits
until the last possible second.

04:58.364 --> 05:00.366
.
He timed it
perfectly, sir

05:00.366 --> 05:02.869
He certainly did.
Nice job, fellas.

05:02.869 --> 05:04.370
He gave me
a heart attack.

05:04.370 --> 05:06.372
Well, we were
in a time lock on this one.

05:06.372 --> 05:08.374
It was the only way
to get him to target fast.

05:08.374 --> 05:10.376
Now, if they
just believe

05:10.376 --> 05:11.878
,
that he went d
own with the plane

05:11.878 --> 05:14.881
it should make things 
a little easier for him.

05:25.892 --> 05:26.893
se!
Get my hor

05:26.893 --> 05:29.395
You're not my father.
I don't have to.

05:29.395 --> 05:30.396
.
Do it yourself

05:30.396 --> 05:32.899
No! Ahmed,
go get the horse.

05:32.899 --> 05:34.901
Now.

05:36.903 --> 05:39.906
The Soviets will
pay for any part
of that plane.

05:39.906 --> 05:42.408
..
If there is a pilot.

05:42.408 --> 05:45.411
they will pay even more.

05:49.916 --> 05:51.918
(whimpering)

05:56.422 --> 05:58.424
(horse whinnying)

06:07.934 --> 06:10.436
Mother, you're bleeding.

06:12.939 --> 06:14.440
MacGYVER:
No company waiting for me.

06:14.941 --> 06:16.943
That's a good beginning.

06:20.446 --> 06:23.449
Hiding the parachute was
standard operating procedure,

06:23.950 --> 06:25.451
but if the Russians know
I'm here,

06:25.952 --> 06:29.956
it's not going to make
much difference anyway.

06:42.468 --> 06:44.971
(speaking native language)

06:49.475 --> 06:50.977
Dawn's coming,

06:51.477 --> 06:54.480
so the chance
of being discovered increases.

06:54.981 --> 06:56.482
On the other hand,

06:56.482 --> 06:58.484
I'm getting closer
to where the satellite hit.

07:04.991 --> 07:06.492
Found it, Lieutenant.

07:06.492 --> 07:09.495
Some of it
is still burning.

07:09.495 --> 07:12.498
(horse whinnies)

07:12.498 --> 07:14.500
LIEUTENANT:
Don't touch anything.

07:14.500 --> 07:17.503
We'll bring the experts
from Kabul.

07:24.510 --> 07:26.512
...
Lieutenant

07:32.018 --> 07:35.521
There, on the cliff.

07:35.521 --> 07:37.523
LIEUTENANT:
There's no way
off that mesa

07:37.523 --> 07:39.025
except the way
he went up.

07:39.025 --> 07:40.026
He's trapped.

07:40.026 --> 07:41.527
(chuckles)

07:41.527 --> 07:43.529
Let's go! He's on the mesa!

07:43.529 --> 07:46.032
A month's pay to the man
who brings him down.

07:52.538 --> 07:55.541
You heard the lieutenant.
Let's go!

07:55.541 --> 07:58.544
(shouting)

08:03.549 --> 08:07.553
MacGYVER:
There it is... just about where
they said it'd be.

08:10.056 --> 08:12.558
It's all too easy.

08:12.558 --> 08:15.561
Maybe for once it is
really going to work out

08:15.561 --> 08:17.563
the way it was planned.

08:20.566 --> 08:23.069
The data capsule
is booby-trapped, of course,

08:23.069 --> 08:26.072
but they told me
I'd have plenty of time

08:26.072 --> 08:28.074
to disarm the mechanism.

08:29.075 --> 08:31.577
(beeping rapidly)

08:33.578 --> 08:36.582
Well, they told me
I'd have plenty of time.

08:44.090 --> 08:46.592
From the sound of things,
I'm about 20 seconds away

08:46.592 --> 08:49.095
from becoming a part
of the landscape.

08:55.601 --> 08:58.104
(beeping rapidly)

09:00.606 --> 09:02.608
Okay.

09:18.624 --> 09:19.625
And there it is.

09:21.627 --> 09:24.130
Pete said it'd be simple.

09:25.131 --> 09:27.133
Looks like he was right.

09:27.133 --> 09:30.136
in!
Straight u
p the mounta

09:31.637 --> 09:34.140
s.
There's no way to 
get down but through u

09:34.140 --> 09:36.142
(horse whinnying)

09:47.653 --> 09:49.655
MacGYVER:
Oh, wonderful.

09:49.655 --> 09:51.657
What happened to simple?

09:52.658 --> 09:56.162
Make sure you clear
the ridge.

09:56.162 --> 09:58.164
(men speaking Russian
in the distance)

10:15.181 --> 10:17.183
(explosion)

10:26.192 --> 10:28.194
(explosion)

10:28.694 --> 10:29.695
MacGYVER:
It's hard to believe

10:29.695 --> 10:32.698
this plastic's been in space
for 15 years.

10:32.698 --> 10:35.701
I was kind of glad
it was partly intact.

10:44.710 --> 10:46.212
(shouting)

10:51.717 --> 10:55.721
(explosion)

10:55.721 --> 10:57.223
(shouting)

11:00.226 --> 11:03.229
MacGYVER:
Lord, I hate heights.

11:08.234 --> 11:09.735
(gunfire)

11:24.250 --> 11:26.752
(shouts)

11:33.759 --> 11:35.761
(shouting)

11:40.766 --> 11:42.768
Quickly! Quickly!

12:02.788 --> 12:05.791
(loud, excited chatter)

12:12.798 --> 12:14.300
(glider flapping in wind)

12:16.802 --> 12:19.305
(glider flapping)

12:28.814 --> 12:30.816
(pained groan)

12:32.318 --> 12:34.320
(man ululating)

12:34.320 --> 12:35.321
(gunshot)

12:35.321 --> 12:36.322
(ululating)

12:37.823 --> 12:40.826
(man ululating, gunshot)

12:40.826 --> 12:42.328
(groans)

12:42.328 --> 12:44.330
(gunshot)

12:45.831 --> 12:46.832
(pained groan)

12:46.832 --> 12:47.833
(gunshot)

12:47.833 --> 12:50.836
(groaning)

12:51.837 --> 12:53.339
(ululating)

12:53.339 --> 12:56.842
(gunshot)

12:58.844 --> 13:00.346
(gunshot)

13:00.346 --> 13:01.847
(shouting)

13:05.851 --> 13:06.852
(shouting)

13:08.354 --> 13:11.357
(grunts)

13:22.368 --> 13:24.370
(panting)

13:28.874 --> 13:30.876
(loud, excited chatter)

13:36.382 --> 13:37.883
Get up!
(groans)

13:37.883 --> 13:39.885
!
Get up, or they'
ll kill you! Please

13:39.885 --> 13:41.887
I don't think I can.

13:42.888 --> 13:44.890
(groans)

13:53.399 --> 13:55.401
(loud, excited chatter)

14:00.906 --> 14:03.409
(panting)

14:09.915 --> 14:12.418
Whoa!

14:12.918 --> 14:14.420
It may be Allah's will
that you will die here,

14:14.920 --> 14:16.422
but I will help you.

14:16.422 --> 14:19.425
Quickly!
Get on the horse!

14:20.926 --> 14:22.428
(groaning)

14:22.428 --> 14:23.929
Hang on!

14:28.934 --> 14:31.437
We must leave the river
before they come.

14:48.454 --> 14:50.956
(horse neighing)

14:53.959 --> 14:55.961
My name is Ahmed.

14:55.961 --> 14:57.963
?
MacGyver.
Where are we going

14:57.963 --> 14:59.465
To my house.

14:59.465 --> 15:00.466
Are you an American?

15:00.466 --> 15:01.967
Yeah.

15:01.967 --> 15:03.469
I don't think your father's
gonna be too happy

15:03.469 --> 15:04.970
about you bringin'
a stranger home.

15:04.970 --> 15:05.971
Don't worry.

15:06.472 --> 15:07.973
There's no one eve
r at my house

15:07.973 --> 15:09.475
besides my mot
her and me.

15:09.475 --> 15:10.976
Why are you helping me?

15:11.477 --> 15:12.478
Because they kille
d my father.

15:12.478 --> 15:13.979
The Russians?

15:13.979 --> 15:17.483
rs.
No, a man named Khalil
and his band of traito

15:18.984 --> 15:21.487
(men screaming)

15:21.487 --> 15:24.990
No, I tried to shoot him,
but I was cracked down.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.001
Where is he?

15:36.001 --> 15:38.003
He got away.

15:38.003 --> 15:39.004
But he was wounded.

15:39.004 --> 15:41.507
Wounded.

15:41.507 --> 15:43.008
You let him get away?

15:43.008 --> 15:44.510
He cannot have gone too far.

15:47.513 --> 15:50.516
't!
No, don't!
I beg you! Don

15:54.520 --> 15:56.522
(gunshots)

16:06.031 --> 16:09.535
The pilot will bring
a fat price, my children.

16:09.535 --> 16:11.036
Bring him to me.

16:11.036 --> 16:13.038
(chuckling)

16:13.038 --> 16:16.041
I have unfinished business
to attend to.

16:16.041 --> 16:17.543
You know where to find me.

16:17.543 --> 16:20.546
(men speaking
in native language)

16:27.553 --> 16:29.555
(chickens clucking)

16:35.561 --> 16:37.062
This is my house.

16:40.566 --> 16:41.567
(groaning)

16:42.067 --> 16:45.571
You are bleeding badly.

16:45.571 --> 16:46.572
(shooing horse)

16:49.575 --> 16:51.076
(sheep bleating)

16:54.580 --> 16:58.584
Oh! God in heaven,
who is this man?

17:01.086 --> 17:02.087
m.
Khalil's men shot hi

17:02.087 --> 17:04.089
And the Soviets
are looking for him.

17:04.089 --> 17:05.590
an.
He's an Americ

17:06.090 --> 17:07.092
Ahmed, we can'
t have him here.

17:07.092 --> 17:08.093
.
It's too dangerous

17:08.093 --> 17:10.095
But, Mother,
they'll kill him.

17:10.095 --> 17:12.598
If Khalil finds him
here, he'll kill us.

17:13.098 --> 17:14.098
p.
AHMED:
He could hel

17:14.098 --> 17:15.099
him
I've seen

17:15.099 --> 17:16.602
fly in the air like a spirit.

17:17.102 --> 17:20.105
And then wounded as you see,
he fought one of the militia

17:20.105 --> 17:22.107
and knocked him
into the river.

17:22.107 --> 17:24.609
I am sorry to bother you, ma'am.

17:26.111 --> 17:27.112
Please?

17:27.112 --> 17:29.114
Please, Mother.

17:32.117 --> 17:33.619
All right.

17:33.619 --> 17:36.622
He can stay just for tonight.

17:52.137 --> 17:53.138
Ahmed, go outside.

17:53.138 --> 17:54.640
If Khalil comes, warn me.

17:54.640 --> 17:56.141
But, Mother...
Go!

18:21.667 --> 18:22.167
Sit up!

18:22.668 --> 18:25.170
We must stop
the bleeding.

18:25.170 --> 18:26.672
(groaning)

18:49.194 --> 18:50.195
Where is your mother?

18:50.195 --> 18:52.197
It does not matt
er where she is.

18:52.197 --> 18:53.198
She's finished with you.

18:53.198 --> 18:54.700
What?

18:54.700 --> 18:56.201
.
There is another
to take your place

18:56.201 --> 18:57.202
d
You're an ugly toa

18:57.202 --> 18:58.704
and the man with her
will kill you.

18:58.704 --> 18:59.705
KHALIL
: Woman!

18:59.705 --> 19:00.706
Khalil!

19:02.708 --> 19:03.709
.
I'll go out to him

19:03.709 --> 19:06.712
No, no, no, wait.

19:06.712 --> 19:08.714
?
Is that cylinder
filled with butane

19:09.214 --> 19:09.715
WOMA
N: Yes.

19:10.215 --> 19:11.216
Let him come to us.

19:13.719 --> 19:15.721
!
AHMED:
You are the offspr
ing of a diseased goat

19:15.721 --> 19:18.724
And my mother
is with another man!

19:21.727 --> 19:23.228
KHALIL:
I will kil
l them both!

19:25.731 --> 19:26.732
(grunting)

19:27.733 --> 19:28.734
(gunshot)

19:33.739 --> 19:34.740
Shoot him.

19:35.240 --> 19:36.241
Shoot him!

19:36.241 --> 19:37.743
He killed my father.

19:38.243 --> 19:40.746
He shot himself.

19:40.746 --> 19:43.749
He's dead.

19:48.253 --> 19:50.756
(blowtorch hissing)

20:09.274 --> 20:13.278
LIEUTENANT:
The Afghan militiamen report
the American was wounded twice.

20:13.278 --> 20:15.280
In the shoulder
and in the hand.

20:15.280 --> 20:16.281
Then where is he?

20:16.281 --> 20:18.283
h.
Hiding.
Bleeding to deat

20:18.283 --> 20:19.284
.
We'll find him

20:19.284 --> 20:20.786
nt?
Why is thi
s so importa

20:20.786 --> 20:23.288
Because
of that spy satellite.

20:23.288 --> 20:25.791
I have a technical expert
coming down from Kabul.

20:26.291 --> 20:28.794
But we still have to know
why the American is here.

20:28.794 --> 20:30.295
.
To contact
the resistance

20:30.295 --> 20:32.297
You mean the bandits.

20:32.297 --> 20:33.298
se.
Bandits... of cour

20:33.298 --> 20:34.299
g.
I keep forgettin

20:34.299 --> 20:36.802
In any case, I want
every available man

20:36.802 --> 20:39.805
out on patrol tomorrow,
including the militia.

20:39.805 --> 20:41.807
r.
We're short
of personnel, si

20:42.307 --> 20:43.809
Well, then use
Sergeant Borsov.

20:43.809 --> 20:46.812
His tank will not be operational
for a few days anyway.

20:46.812 --> 20:47.813
And what about Khalil?
Where is he?

20:48.313 --> 20:48.814
You can use him.

20:49.314 --> 20:50.315
r.
I don't know, si

20:50.315 --> 20:53.318
.
I'll send him to you
as soon as he comes in

21:12.337 --> 21:14.840
ad.
It is done
, and I'm gl

21:15.340 --> 21:16.341
He was a pretty big guy.

21:16.842 --> 21:17.843
How'd you do that?

21:17.843 --> 21:19.344
We dragged him to his grave

21:19.344 --> 21:21.346
like a dead dog
behind his horse.

21:21.346 --> 21:24.349
p.
This is Khalil's whi

21:26.351 --> 21:27.853
When you are well,
you will beat me with it.

21:28.353 --> 21:29.855
Beat you? Why?

21:32.357 --> 21:34.860
I lied to you.

21:34.860 --> 21:37.362
I told you there was
never anyone at my house

21:37.362 --> 21:38.864
besides my mother and me.

21:38.864 --> 21:39.865
I promised my mother

21:40.365 --> 21:42.367
n.
I would rid her 
of this terrible ma

21:42.367 --> 21:45.871
But I wasn't strong enough,
so...

21:46.872 --> 21:49.875
So you used me.

21:49.875 --> 21:52.878
When I saw the way
you could fight at the river,

21:52.878 --> 21:54.379
I knew you could defeat Khalil.

21:54.880 --> 21:56.882
Is your mother aware
of all this?

21:56.882 --> 21:58.884
She's a woman.

21:58.884 --> 22:00.886
She doesn't know
about men's business.

22:00.886 --> 22:03.388
So where is she now?

22:03.388 --> 22:05.390
Milking the goat.

22:05.390 --> 22:06.892
Isn't that your job?

22:06.892 --> 22:08.393
It's not a man's work.

22:10.395 --> 22:13.398
The goat doesn't like me.

22:13.398 --> 22:14.399
She won't give me milk.

22:16.401 --> 22:17.903
d.
I saw you 
fly like a bir

22:18.403 --> 22:20.906
But how did you make
part of our stove fly?

22:20.906 --> 22:23.408
Well, now that's
a professional secret.

22:23.408 --> 22:25.410
Can you make other things fly?

22:25.410 --> 22:27.412
y?
Can you teac
h me how to fl

22:27.412 --> 22:30.415
Ahmed, you leave MacGyver alone.

22:30.916 --> 22:32.918
He needs rest,
not questions.

22:32.918 --> 22:34.419
But you saw
what he did.

22:34.419 --> 22:35.420
I saw.

22:36.421 --> 22:37.923
How is it?

22:37.923 --> 22:41.927
Oh, you know, I think
I'm gonna live, thanks to you.

22:41.927 --> 22:43.929
And, of course,
to the man of the house.

22:45.430 --> 22:47.933
Ahmed, go set the horse free.

22:48.433 --> 22:49.935
But he's a beautiful horse.

22:49.935 --> 22:51.937
And he has a bridle
made of real silver.

22:51.937 --> 22:52.938
ey.
Worth much mon

22:52.938 --> 22:53.939
He is Khalil's.

22:53.939 --> 22:55.440
He must not be found.

22:55.440 --> 22:57.442
Get rid of him quickly.

22:57.442 --> 22:58.443
Go.

23:01.446 --> 23:02.948
Hey.

23:03.448 --> 23:05.450
Don't forget your whip.

23:20.966 --> 23:22.467
...
So

23:22.467 --> 23:25.470
how long before Khalil's people
come looking for me?

23:25.470 --> 23:27.973
I don't know.

23:27.973 --> 23:29.975
I think you do.

23:29.975 --> 23:32.477
I think I'd better
start gettin' out of here

23:32.477 --> 23:33.478
before something happens.

23:34.980 --> 23:36.982
t.
You can'

23:36.982 --> 23:37.983
There's no need.

23:37.983 --> 23:39.484
.
If they come,
we'll hide you

23:39.985 --> 23:41.987
You can barely walk.

23:43.989 --> 23:45.991
You must stay.

23:45.991 --> 23:47.492
l.
You must hea

23:50.996 --> 23:51.997
I think you're right.

23:52.497 --> 23:53.999
Does it hurt?

23:53.999 --> 23:57.002
Yeah.

23:57.002 --> 23:58.503
The arm?

23:58.503 --> 24:01.506
Just the shoulder.

24:01.506 --> 24:04.509
Let me look at it.

24:07.012 --> 24:09.014
ed.
It has been infect

24:09.014 --> 24:10.515
It has to be cauterized.

24:10.515 --> 24:12.017
Ouch!

24:24.029 --> 24:25.530
(horse whinnying)

24:26.031 --> 24:27.532
You are so beautiful.

24:28.033 --> 24:30.035
I wish I could keep you.

24:30.035 --> 24:32.537
My mother doesn't understand.

24:32.537 --> 24:35.040
This silver bridle,
I'll keep it.

24:35.040 --> 24:36.541
It'll come in handy.

24:39.044 --> 24:40.545
Shoo!

25:08.073 --> 25:09.574
Bite.

25:09.574 --> 25:12.577
How's it you know so much
about treating bullet wounds?

25:12.577 --> 25:14.079
Since the Russians came,

25:14.079 --> 25:16.581
all Afghans know about
bullet wounds.

25:17.082 --> 25:18.083
Bite.

25:32.597 --> 25:34.099
(groans)

25:34.099 --> 25:37.102
(sizzling)

26:32.657 --> 26:34.159
Mother,

26:34.159 --> 26:36.661
is he dead?

26:39.664 --> 26:41.166
It's all right, Ahmed.

26:41.166 --> 26:42.667
He's only sleeping.

26:45.170 --> 26:49.174
We have his trust
and he's healing now.

26:49.174 --> 26:50.675
ay?
Will he st

26:51.176 --> 26:53.178
I don't think so.

26:53.178 --> 26:55.180
There is nothing
for him here.

26:55.180 --> 26:57.182
ins
But there's the mounta

26:57.182 --> 26:59.184
.
and the barn and the house

26:59.184 --> 27:03.188
I'll even show h
im my secret place.

27:03.188 --> 27:05.190
o.
There's so much to d

27:14.699 --> 27:15.700
.
He'll stay

27:15.700 --> 27:17.202
.
I know he will

27:17.202 --> 27:22.207
We need him.

27:29.547 --> 27:32.050
on?
Mother, when w
ill he wake up? So

27:32.050 --> 27:33.551
He slept all night again

27:33.551 --> 27:36.054
and this morning there
was no infection.

27:36.054 --> 27:38.056
ay.
At first you s
aid he couldn't st

27:38.556 --> 27:40.058
...
But yesterday you said

27:40.058 --> 27:41.559
ng!
Good morni

27:41.559 --> 27:43.061
'Morning.

27:43.061 --> 27:44.562
What are you doing
out of bed?

27:44.562 --> 27:45.563
Well, to tell you the truth,

27:46.064 --> 27:47.565
I was starting to feel
a little...

27:47.565 --> 27:49.067
Hungry?

27:49.067 --> 27:50.068
Hungry.

27:50.068 --> 27:51.569
That's a very good sign.

27:51.569 --> 27:53.571
I'll get you some food.

27:53.571 --> 27:55.073
Ahmed, get me some water.

27:55.573 --> 27:58.076
.
Excuse me.
Just one thing

27:58.076 --> 27:59.077
Uh...

28:01.079 --> 28:03.581
I put them on you
while you were sleeping.

28:03.581 --> 28:05.583
They belonged to my husband.

28:10.088 --> 28:13.591
MAN:
Oh, this horse
of Khalil's.

28:13.591 --> 28:16.094
Just as mean
and treacherous as he is.

28:16.094 --> 28:18.096
?
Where is his silver bridle

28:20.598 --> 28:23.101
Lieutenant,
this is Khalil's horse,

28:23.101 --> 28:25.103
but Khalil's nowhere
to be found.

28:25.103 --> 28:26.104
Perhaps an ambush?

28:27.605 --> 28:30.108
The stupid pump is broken.

28:30.108 --> 28:31.609
And so is my back.

28:31.609 --> 28:35.613
Well, how long has
it been since it's worked?

28:35.613 --> 28:36.614
s.
Year

28:36.614 --> 28:39.617
It makes sounds,
but no water.

28:39.617 --> 28:42.620
AHMED:
I told you it doesn't work.

28:42.620 --> 28:45.623
It's not creating a vacuum.
That's why.

28:46.124 --> 28:47.625
Machines never
work very long.

28:47.625 --> 28:48.626
And I cannot fix them.

28:48.626 --> 28:50.628
e.
You got to have
a little patienc

28:50.628 --> 28:52.130
t.
Like you should with the goa

28:52.130 --> 28:53.631
Back track the horse.
You follow me.

28:53.631 --> 28:54.632
Yes, sir.

28:55.633 --> 28:56.634
Ho! Ho!

29:00.138 --> 29:02.140
MacGYVER:
You see, wrapp
ing the plunger

29:02.640 --> 29:04.642
t.
with this material
will make it airtigh

29:08.646 --> 29:12.150
Make sure there are
no wrinkles in this.

29:12.150 --> 29:14.652
The packing has go
t to be smooth.

29:14.652 --> 29:19.157
All right, let me see
the end of the pump now.

29:24.662 --> 29:25.663
That fits.

29:25.663 --> 29:26.664
Let's try it.

29:29.167 --> 29:30.668
Got it?

29:34.672 --> 29:37.175
All right, pull it
down real tight.

29:37.175 --> 29:40.178
I'm going to test it before we
screw down that base plate.

29:48.686 --> 29:50.688
AHMED:
It works!

29:51.189 --> 29:52.690
You see?

29:52.690 --> 29:54.192
MacGyver can do miracles.

29:54.192 --> 29:57.695
If you stay, you could fix
the house and the barn roof

29:57.695 --> 29:58.696
and teach me to fly.

29:59.197 --> 30:00.198
Oh, you bet.

30:00.198 --> 30:02.700
Anytime. No problem.

30:13.211 --> 30:15.713
This dispatch is from
Captain Osharansky.

30:15.713 --> 30:18.216
He's very unhappy
to have not found

30:18.216 --> 30:20.218
hide nor hair of this American.

30:20.218 --> 30:21.719
Or of Khalil, either.

30:21.719 --> 30:23.721
What do you suggest I tell him?

30:23.721 --> 30:25.223
.
I'm sorry, sir

30:25.223 --> 30:26.724
We have searched the caves,
the valleys

30:27.225 --> 30:28.726
and all but a handful
of homesteads.

30:29.227 --> 30:31.729
We have found nothing except
for a few concealed weapons.

30:31.729 --> 30:33.231
And Khalil?

30:33.231 --> 30:34.732
d.
We lost the horse's
trail on rocky groun

30:34.732 --> 30:37.235
Khalil is dead or drunk.

30:37.235 --> 30:38.736
Who knows which?

30:44.742 --> 30:47.245
You expect me to make this
report to Captain Osharansky?

30:47.245 --> 30:49.747
t.
Sir, there are
only a handful
 of farmhouses lef

30:49.747 --> 30:51.749
I'm sure we will find him
in one of them.

30:51.749 --> 30:53.251
I hope you're right.

30:53.251 --> 30:56.254
I have been in this God-forsaken
wilderness for two years.

30:56.254 --> 30:57.255
I hate it.

30:57.755 --> 30:59.257
But I suspect it might be
considerably better

30:59.257 --> 31:00.258
than a stockade.

31:00.258 --> 31:01.759
You take my meaning, Sergeant?

31:02.260 --> 31:03.761
Yes, sir.

31:48.806 --> 31:51.309
I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to wake you.

31:52.810 --> 31:53.811
It's not important.

31:54.312 --> 31:55.813
You leaving tomorrow?

31:55.813 --> 31:57.315
Yeah.

31:59.317 --> 32:02.320
The longer I stay,
the more dangerous it is

32:02.320 --> 32:03.821
for you and Ahmed.

32:06.324 --> 32:08.826
It meant a great deal
to Ahmed to have you here.

32:15.833 --> 32:16.834
You're crying.

32:28.846 --> 32:32.350
It's very difficult
to say good-bye to someone

32:32.350 --> 32:33.851
who means so much.

33:09.387 --> 33:10.888
So where's Ahmed
this morning?

33:10.888 --> 33:13.391
I sent him out to look around.

33:13.391 --> 33:15.893
I'm sure they're still
looking for you.

33:17.395 --> 33:19.397
You're staring at me.

33:19.397 --> 33:21.399
I just want to remember.

33:21.399 --> 33:22.400
Do you mind?

33:22.400 --> 33:23.901
Not at all.

33:27.905 --> 33:29.907
Mother! MacGyver!

33:35.913 --> 33:37.915
Soviets! Soviets!
They're coming!

33:37.915 --> 33:38.916
Get inside.

33:38.916 --> 33:40.418
.
MacGyver, this way

33:44.422 --> 33:46.924
All right, I'll take it
from here.

33:46.924 --> 33:47.925
You get inside.

33:55.933 --> 33:57.935
Get to the table.

33:57.935 --> 33:58.936
Eat.

34:57.495 --> 34:58.496
Eat.

35:03.000 --> 35:04.001
nt?
What do you wa

35:04.502 --> 35:06.003
In the house, woman.

35:11.509 --> 35:13.010
d.
My son, Ahme

35:34.031 --> 35:35.032
Smells good.

35:35.032 --> 35:36.534
You're Khalil's woman--

35:37.034 --> 35:41.038
the one who was married
to the resistance leader.

35:41.038 --> 35:45.543
The one who Khalil shot...
in the back.

35:46.043 --> 35:47.044
Why not?

35:47.545 --> 35:49.547
He kills everything that keeps
him from getting what he wants.

35:50.047 --> 35:51.048
When did you see him last?

35:51.048 --> 35:52.550
Yesterday, day before...

35:52.550 --> 35:53.551
Who remembers?

35:54.051 --> 35:55.052
(chickens clucking)

35:55.052 --> 35:57.054
I'll get you some more.

36:28.586 --> 36:29.587
What is this?

36:30.087 --> 36:31.088
What is this?!

36:31.589 --> 36:33.090
Where is Khalil?

36:40.598 --> 36:41.599
AFGHAN:
Answer me, woman.

36:42.099 --> 36:43.601
Where is Khalil?

37:32.149 --> 37:33.150
Kill him.

37:33.150 --> 37:34.151
Kill him, MacGyver.

37:34.151 --> 37:35.653
He's the enemy.

37:39.657 --> 37:41.158
Get out of here.

37:41.659 --> 37:43.160
Go on. Run.

37:44.662 --> 37:45.663
Go on.

37:51.669 --> 37:53.170
Why?

37:53.170 --> 37:55.172
Because I didn't have to.

37:55.172 --> 37:57.675
That should be
reason enough for anybody.

37:57.675 --> 38:00.678
You know, the Red Army
's gonna be here in no ti
me.

38:00.678 --> 38:02.179
All we can do is go.

38:02.179 --> 38:05.182
Yes.

38:05.182 --> 38:06.183
I'm sorry.

38:08.185 --> 38:09.186
We have no life here.

38:09.186 --> 38:10.688
There's only killing.

38:10.688 --> 38:13.691
We are ready to go.

38:14.191 --> 38:15.192
Where?

38:15.192 --> 38:16.694
Well, we got transportation,

38:17.194 --> 38:18.195
a little bit of a head start

38:18.195 --> 38:20.197
and the Pakistani
border's real close.

38:20.197 --> 38:22.700
an?
Why don't you
get what you c

38:22.700 --> 38:24.201
y.
Help your mother, bo

38:48.225 --> 38:49.226
(grunts)

38:51.729 --> 38:53.230
Ah! What's this?

38:53.230 --> 38:54.732
Wait!

38:54.732 --> 38:56.734
Stop! Wait!

38:56.734 --> 38:57.735
Wait!

38:59.737 --> 39:00.738
What happened?

39:00.738 --> 39:01.739
The American.

39:02.239 --> 39:03.240
Stop! Get in!

39:08.746 --> 39:09.747
Quickly.

39:24.261 --> 39:26.263
The quickest way
is through that pass.

39:26.263 --> 39:28.766
re?
Are you su

39:28.766 --> 39:30.267
These hills are my home.

39:30.267 --> 39:32.269
Well, that's g
ood enough for me.

39:48.285 --> 39:49.787
If it was not
for my desperate need

39:50.287 --> 39:53.791
of non-commissioned officers,
I would have you shot.

39:54.291 --> 39:56.293
One man.

39:56.293 --> 39:58.796
One single, wounded man,

39:58.796 --> 40:03.801
and you lose your vehicle,
your weapons--andthe man.

40:04.301 --> 40:05.803
You are going
back out on patrol.

40:06.303 --> 40:06.804
Yes, sir.

40:07.304 --> 40:07.805
Take the tank,

40:08.305 --> 40:09.807
and if you find
the American,

40:09.807 --> 40:12.810
you'll only lose
your rank andsixmonths' pay.

40:13.310 --> 40:13.811
.
But, sir..

40:14.311 --> 40:15.312
If you do
not find him,

40:15.312 --> 40:16.814
I will have
you court-martialed

40:16.814 --> 40:18.315
for dereliction of duty.

40:18.315 --> 40:19.316
Now go!

40:31.328 --> 40:34.331
.
The border is ju
st beyond this rise

40:37.835 --> 40:41.338
There they are on the ridge.
They're heading for the border.

40:41.338 --> 40:42.840
Quickly, drive.

40:48.345 --> 40:50.347
This looks like a good place.

40:50.848 --> 40:51.849
Stop here.

40:51.849 --> 40:53.851
It'll be a good field of fire.

40:54.351 --> 40:56.353
Stop.

40:56.353 --> 40:57.855
Get the bazooka.

41:17.374 --> 41:18.375
Again.

41:18.375 --> 41:19.877
Another round.

41:24.882 --> 41:26.383
AHMED:
What can we do?

41:26.884 --> 41:27.885
MacGYVER:
Just hang on.

41:30.888 --> 41:31.889
Move right.

41:44.902 --> 41:46.403
MacGYVER:
Everybody okay?

41:46.403 --> 41:47.404
I'm okay.

41:47.404 --> 41:48.405
Yes, fine.

41:48.405 --> 41:49.406
It's dead.

41:49.406 --> 41:50.908
And so are we.

41:50.908 --> 41:51.909
Maybe not.

41:54.411 --> 41:56.914
It is impossible
to fight them.

41:56.914 --> 41:58.916
We could if we had
some heavy artillery,

41:58.916 --> 42:00.417
and this is jeep
will position 'em just right.

42:05.422 --> 42:06.423
Here.

42:08.425 --> 42:09.426
That's water.

42:09.426 --> 42:10.427
Yeah, help
me carry it.

42:10.427 --> 42:11.428
Come on.

42:21.438 --> 42:22.940
What are you
doing, MacGyver?

42:22.940 --> 42:24.441
Making that artillery, I hope.

42:24.441 --> 42:25.943
Ahmed, get that water up here.

42:25.943 --> 42:28.445
What're you
going to use it for?

42:28.946 --> 42:30.447
MacGYVER:
I've got an idea.

42:35.953 --> 42:37.454
Pour it in here.

42:42.459 --> 42:43.961
I don't understand.

42:43.961 --> 42:45.462
Well, it was
freezing last night.

42:45.963 --> 42:46.964
These rocks ar
e already cold.

42:47.464 --> 42:49.466
That fire extinguish
er uses carbon dioxide

42:49.466 --> 42:51.468
which produces a muc
h, much greater cold.

42:51.969 --> 42:52.469
Stand back.

42:52.970 --> 42:53.971
I still don't understand.

42:53.971 --> 42:56.473
f.
Well, wate
r's funny stuf

42:56.473 --> 42:58.475
,
When it gets cold
enough, it expands

42:58.976 --> 43:00.978
ks.
and there's only so mu
ch room between these roc

43:02.479 --> 43:05.482
(crackling)

43:13.490 --> 43:15.993
A little more water
and a little more ice

43:15.993 --> 43:18.495
and then we'll
help it along some.

43:23.000 --> 43:24.501
It froze.
Yeah, the water's
expanding.

43:30.007 --> 43:31.508
All right, get
back down there.

43:47.524 --> 43:49.526
(crackling)

43:54.031 --> 43:55.532
CAPTAIN:
The jeep.

43:55.532 --> 43:57.034
It is disabled.

43:59.536 --> 44:02.039
They could not be far away.

44:09.546 --> 44:11.548
(crackling)

44:32.069 --> 44:34.571
.
Down through there
and two kilometers

44:34.571 --> 44:37.074
Easy walk to the border.

44:37.574 --> 44:38.075
Piece of cake.

44:40.077 --> 44:41.078
Come on, Ahmed.

44:58.595 --> 45:00.097
AHMED:
That's the soldi
er you let go.

45:03.100 --> 45:04.101
MacGyver.

45:04.101 --> 45:05.602
Easy, now.

45:06.103 --> 45:08.105
As long as we're alive,
there's still a chance.

45:08.605 --> 45:09.606
American.

45:09.606 --> 45:12.609
If I had seen you,
I might tell you...

45:12.609 --> 45:16.613
the border is
two kilometers due east,

45:17.114 --> 45:19.116
but next time, American...

45:19.616 --> 45:21.118
next time...

45:21.618 --> 45:24.621
I drop roof onyourhead.

45:31.628 --> 45:33.630
(tank starting)

45:36.633 --> 45:39.636
If you had shot him
like I asked...

45:39.636 --> 45:41.638
there would be another one
to take his place,

45:41.638 --> 45:45.642
andhewould have
killed us for sure.

45:45.642 --> 45:47.144
Something to think
about, isn't it?

45:51.148 --> 45:53.650
There's still
two kilometers left.

45:53.650 --> 45:56.153
Plenty of time
for two men to say good-bye.
