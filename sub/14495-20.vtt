00:01.801 --> 00:03.801
I know you believe in the future.

00:03.802 --> 00:05.802
But i believe in people.

00:05.803 --> 00:08.803
And i choose to believe in you Iron Man.

00:08.804 --> 00:10.104
You're sure you want this?

00:10.105 --> 00:11.405
Yeah.

00:11.406 --> 00:13.006
You got it then.

00:19.707 --> 00:22.007
Red Hulk is a success.

00:22.008 --> 00:23.608
Wouldn't you agree Doctor?

00:23.609 --> 00:24.909
I'd say so.

00:24.910 --> 00:26.510
Excellent.

00:30.011 --> 00:32.511
United States Secretary of Defense,
Dell Rusk...

00:32.512 --> 00:34.512
Held a special press conference this morning.

00:34.513 --> 00:36.413
Where he reiterated his bans on...

00:36.414 --> 00:37.814
The Avengers!

00:37.815 --> 00:40.115
Some may call them heroes...

00:40.116 --> 00:43.116
but they are nothing more
than a superpowered army.

00:43.117 --> 00:45.717
working above the laws of our government.

00:45.718 --> 00:49.718
They present a clear danger to
hard working american citizens.

00:49.719 --> 00:53.019
And i will be keeping
a close eye on them.

00:53.020 --> 00:56.320
That's it. I'm crossing Dell Rusk
off my Christmas card list.

00:56.321 --> 00:58.621
Iron Man!
Keep your head on the game!

00:58.622 --> 01:00.322
You tell me not to multi task?

01:00.623 --> 01:03.123
- That's not gonna happen.
- Don't worry about Dell Rusk.

01:03.424 --> 01:06.924
PolÃ­ticians come and go.
the work we do lives on.

01:09.925 --> 01:12.325
If i'd said something like
the work we do lives on...

01:12.326 --> 01:13.626
it would sound corny

01:13.627 --> 01:16.127
But coming from you, it's so natural.

01:22.628 --> 01:24.128
I'm full of suprises.

01:29.929 --> 01:31.729
See, this suprises you.

01:31.730 --> 01:33.630
The Avengers need a new leader.

01:33.631 --> 01:35.331
- Officially.
- What are you saying?

01:35.332 --> 01:37.832
I founded the Avengers to get a job done.

01:37.833 --> 01:39.633
But there was something missing.

01:39.634 --> 01:41.134
Until you came along.

01:41.135 --> 01:44.135
It took  while for you
to catch up with the 21st century.

01:44.136 --> 01:47.336
But now that you are here
you are the face of the Avengers.

01:47.337 --> 01:48.937
You are the leader we need.

01:50.438 --> 01:53.438
Tony...
I don't know what to say.

01:53.439 --> 01:55.139
Start with "yes".

02:03.140 --> 02:04.440
Cap!

02:06.041 --> 02:08.640
Warning. toxicity level of gasses emission...

02:08.642 --> 02:10.442
threatening armor integrity

02:10.443 --> 02:12.743
I'm fine, JARVIS!
what about Cap?

02:20.744 --> 02:23.044
Subtitles : Nakor38

02:23.527 --> 02:25.565
And there came a day, unlike any other

02:25.566 --> 02:27.312
When Earth mightiest heroes

02:27.313 --> 02:29.933
Found themselves united
against a common threat.

02:29.934 --> 02:33.136
On that day, they became the Avengers!

02:33.137 --> 02:35.175
The invincible armored Iron Man!

02:35.176 --> 02:37.407
Thor, prince of thunder!

02:37.408 --> 02:40.125
The Hulk, strongest hero there is!

02:40.126 --> 02:43.328
And Captain America, the first Avenger!

02:43.329 --> 02:46.628
Assembled, we are strong!

02:46.629 --> 02:50.026
Forever fight as one!

02:50.027 --> 02:52.454
Avengers, assemble!

03:11.056 --> 03:13.356
JARVIS, prep the infirmary
Seal the Mansion!

03:13.357 --> 03:16.557
Initiate security lockdown
and patch me through to Thor!

03:17.558 --> 03:19.058
Thor, you read me?

03:19.059 --> 03:20.559
We've got a situation at the Mansion

03:21.160 --> 03:22.860
What madness is this?

03:23.761 --> 03:25.361
That cloud is toxic

03:25.362 --> 03:28.362
Get rid of it before all Manhattan is exposed.

03:28.963 --> 03:30.963
Consider it done my friend.

03:44.464 --> 03:46.964
Body temperature is at 104 and climbing.

03:46.965 --> 03:48.765
And his heart is beating erratically.

03:48.766 --> 03:50.566
He doesn't have long, guys.

03:50.567 --> 03:51.867
He's not the only one.

03:51.868 --> 03:53.668
We don't know how many of us
were exposed.

03:53.869 --> 03:56.969
JARVIS, analysis on this vÃ­rus.
anything on the data banks?

03:56.970 --> 03:58.270
Nothing, Sir.

03:59.171 --> 04:01.471
Easy, pal
Try not to move.

04:04.672 --> 04:07.372
No! Not this!

04:08.273 --> 04:09.873
Not him!

04:12.174 --> 04:13.774
Why do i feel so hot

04:20.774 --> 04:22.775
Panther, look!

04:25.276 --> 04:27.776
It maybe just a matter of time for all of us.

04:27.777 --> 04:30.477
Not to mention anyone exposed
in the streets outside.

04:30.478 --> 04:32.278
We need samples from both of them.

04:32.279 --> 04:35.579
From there, we may be able to use them
to synthesize an antidote.

04:35.580 --> 04:37.380
Sir, incoming call.

04:37.381 --> 04:40.581
Secretary of Defense Rusk
on secure channel M 5

04:40.582 --> 04:42.882
Rusk?
He wants to talk now?

04:44.183 --> 04:47.183
You, Avengers,
have finally crossed the line.

04:47.184 --> 04:50.884
Storing dangerous biotech weapons
in the heart of Manhattan?

04:50.885 --> 04:53.985
This is precisely what i've been talking about.

04:53.986 --> 04:55.886
Mr Secretary, we were attacked.

04:55.887 --> 04:58.687
Tell that to the american people,Stark.

04:58.688 --> 05:01.888
This incident confirms what i've been
telling them all along.

05:01.889 --> 05:04.389
The Avengers cannot be trusted.

05:06.390 --> 05:09.890
Now, i'm shutting you down
until further notice.

05:09.891 --> 05:11.191
You know we can't do that.

05:11.192 --> 05:13.392
As for this incident, we just need time to...

05:13.393 --> 05:14.893
Wrong answer.

05:14.894 --> 05:16.294
The die is cast

05:16.295 --> 05:18.195
I'm officially taking matters...

05:18.196 --> 05:20.496
into my own more capable hands.

05:43.096 --> 05:46.096
Let's keep those samples 
in the accelerator for analysis.

05:46.097 --> 05:47.697
*** giving us much time.

05:47.698 --> 05:49.398
The Wasp is failing fast.

05:49.399 --> 05:51.699
Though Captain America is showing
some resistance.

05:51.700 --> 05:54.000
Maybe the super soldier serum
in his blood.

05:54.301 --> 05:57.001
Sir,an armored division has *** the area.

05:57.002 --> 05:59.802
And the Mansion security systems
have been hacked from the outside.

05:59.803 --> 06:02.503
Hacked? I wrote those programs personally!

06:02.804 --> 06:05.504
And two transports are landing
on the front lawm as we speak.

06:05.505 --> 06:07.505
He's sending in troop
to do what?

06:07.506 --> 06:09.106
Arrest us?

06:18.507 --> 06:21.007
Code Red team, you have your objectives.

06:21.008 --> 06:22.308
then move out.

06:22.309 --> 06:24.409
I hope you guys have you invitation ***

06:24.610 --> 06:26.310
As we don't let just anyone in here.

06:26.911 --> 06:28.511
Here's my invitation!

06:35.112 --> 06:36.912
I don't fall that easily!

06:36.913 --> 06:38.213
We'll see about that.

06:58.614 --> 07:01.614
You dare strike an Asgardian, mortal?

07:03.615 --> 07:06.915
That felt good, let's do it again.

07:16.316 --> 07:19.016
I can't just sit this out

07:19.017 --> 07:22.317
Cap,they're already working on an antidote.

07:22.318 --> 07:25.318
Besides, you're not going anywhere...

07:25.319 --> 07:28.119
- without... me.
- Wasp, no!

07:29.820 --> 07:33.120
Stand out, soldier
You need to rest.

07:34.221 --> 07:37.221
You should heed your own advice
you look terrible.

07:38.122 --> 07:40.522
and certainly in no condition to deal with me.

07:40.523 --> 07:42.923
Luckily, i don't have to.
JARVIS?

07:42.924 --> 07:44.824
Overriding security lockdown.

07:44.825 --> 07:46.925
Initiating internal defense systems.

07:55.826 --> 07:58.926
Where did you learn to move like that?

07:58.927 --> 08:00.627
Now it's your turn!

08:08.328 --> 08:09.628
Come on.

08:09.629 --> 08:11.629
- We need that antidote.
- Yes.

08:11.630 --> 08:15.030
It is taking...
more time... than i anticipated.

08:16.431 --> 08:18.531
Panther,
you OK?

08:18.532 --> 08:20.132
I am fine.

08:22.933 --> 08:24.233
Oh no.

08:28.734 --> 08:31.034
Looks like some needs a doctor.

08:32.235 --> 08:34.934
Samson?
Are you actually working for Rusk?

08:34.936 --> 08:36.736
I thought you were smarter than that!

08:37.437 --> 08:38.736
I'm under orders.

08:38.738 --> 08:40.638
JARVIS,
Some privacy, please.

08:40.639 --> 08:41.938
Acknowledged.

08:41.940 --> 08:43.740
That will hold him for a while.

08:43.741 --> 08:45.041
I hope.

08:48.942 --> 08:50.242
Hey, Doc

08:50.743 --> 08:52.543
We're not done yet.

08:53.844 --> 08:56.344
You can't fight off the infection much longer.

08:56.345 --> 08:58.245
We are here to keep you in quarantine.

08:58.246 --> 08:59.746
And who is "we"?

09:12.447 --> 09:13.747
***!

09:14.048 --> 09:16.048
*** this!

09:50.749 --> 09:52.349
Looking for something?

09:54.050 --> 09:56.150
We're here to save lives, Hawkeye.

09:56.151 --> 09:58.451
Be smart and yours will be one of them.

09:59.452 --> 10:01.452
I'm healthy enough to deal with you.

10:07.653 --> 10:09.353
You're getting sicker by the minute!

10:09.354 --> 10:10.654
I'm a doctor.

10:13.355 --> 10:16.655
I don't... care... if you're...
the surgeon general!

10:40.656 --> 10:42.856
You, Avengers, don't know
when to quit, do you?

10:43.457 --> 10:45.457
Don't you get it?
You brought this on yourselves!

11:00.158 --> 11:03.458
Ultrasonic arrow
birds hate them.

11:05.369 --> 11:08.385
Now, what were you looking for in here?

11:14.757 --> 11:17.319
- Sir.
- Take a message, JARVIS

11:17.320 --> 11:19.762
The simulations show a real progress
against the toxin.

11:19.763 --> 11:21.072
Panther's out...

11:21.073 --> 11:23.382
And one of Rusk's ***
is pounding at my door.

11:25.040 --> 11:27.089
We have an encrypted signal from Hawkeye...

11:27.090 --> 11:29.917
- coming from the training room.
- That i'll take.

11:29.918 --> 11:31.848
Hawkeye, you're hangin in there?

11:32.365 --> 11:33.670
barely.

11:34.223 --> 11:36.624
But i found the reason
we're in this mess.

11:36.625 --> 11:40.185
It's an incendiary device with
a built in emission system.

11:40.186 --> 11:41.852
It caused the explosion...

11:41.853 --> 11:44.352
and released the airborne toxin all at once.

11:44.353 --> 11:47.371
Hold on. i'll do a scan
maybe we'll figure out...

11:47.372 --> 11:49.410
which psycho *** this week

11:49.866 --> 11:51.502
Hold on, Stark.

11:51.503 --> 11:53.647
I've seen this kind of tech before.

11:56.732 --> 11:58.848
In my days as a SHIELD agent. 

11:58.849 --> 12:01.855
This device is DOD, all the way.

12:02.056 --> 12:04.709
Department of Defense?
So Rusk set us up.

12:04.710 --> 12:06.191
But why?

12:06.192 --> 12:08.976
Just an excuse to *** 
a second *** strike team?

12:10.370 --> 12:12.835
I'm gonna leave that one to you.

12:13.515 --> 12:14.974
Have fun.

12:22.770 --> 12:24.914
Hawkeye, do you read me?

12:33.334 --> 12:35.028
Forgive me, Iron Man...

12:35.029 --> 12:38.818
But we're taking control of these premises,
whether you like it or not.

12:38.819 --> 12:40.202
By order of...

12:42.948 --> 12:46.998
Never... turn your back...
on an Avenger...

12:48.737 --> 12:50.539
with an ***.

12:51.308 --> 12:52.803
Carol, no!

12:54.921 --> 12:57.938
JARVIS initiate final sequence
on my voice command.

12:57.939 --> 12:59.851
- Go.
- Processing.

13:01.338 --> 13:04.044
Sir, simulations are showing
full symptom withdrawal...

13:04.045 --> 13:05.799
based on your last antidote ***

13:05.800 --> 13:09.163
- Synthesizing now.
- Make fast, we need it.

13:20.543 --> 13:22.800
My mercy has its limits, brute.

13:22.801 --> 13:25.246
Mercy, what's that?

13:53.135 --> 13:55.125
Come on, let's go.

14:02.462 --> 14:03.896
Yes.

14:13.521 --> 14:14.839
Cap!

14:17.896 --> 14:19.283
Cap!

14:19.284 --> 14:21.327
- JARVIS?
- Scanning.

14:21.904 --> 14:24.235
Captain America is not in the Mansion.

14:24.236 --> 14:27.824
What? where could he have possibly gone
in his condition?

14:44.931 --> 14:47.629
Winter Soldier, you've done much better...

14:47.630 --> 14:49.121
than the rest of Code Red.

14:49.122 --> 14:50.477
Thank you, sir.

14:51.653 --> 14:54.976
You poor misguided outdated soul.

14:56.619 --> 14:58.601
You have no idea what this country needs...

14:58.602 --> 15:00.802
from its heroes, do you?

15:03.051 --> 15:04.854
Don't you realize?

15:04.855 --> 15:08.539
This was all for your benefit.

15:16.129 --> 15:19.041
JARVIS, i'm about 300 miles out 
from Washington DC...

15:19.042 --> 15:21.428
tracking Cap via his Avengers ID card.

15:21.429 --> 15:23.109
What's the status back at the ranch?

15:23.110 --> 15:25.804
The afflicted Avengers are all 
responding to the antidote.

15:25.805 --> 15:28.125
Any affected civilians are also being treated.

15:28.126 --> 15:30.218
The only one left that has not been given the antidote...

15:30.219 --> 15:31.547
is Captain America.

15:31.548 --> 15:33.773
Not for long,i'll *** in...

15:35.143 --> 15:36.531
Attention Iron Man

15:36.532 --> 15:38.802
This is colonel Tom Parker
US Air Command.

15:38.803 --> 15:40.876
We have orders to ground you immediately.

15:40.877 --> 15:42.799
Colonel,i respect you having your orders...

15:42.800 --> 15:44.762
and i have no intention of engaging you.

15:44.763 --> 15:47.393
But i've also no intention of leaving my friend die.

15:47.394 --> 15:49.576
So, if you'll excuse me...

15:58.792 --> 16:00.189
***.

16:00.190 --> 16:02.795
JARVIS lock on the Cap's ID signal.

16:02.796 --> 16:04.739
Give me a targeting solution.

16:15.213 --> 16:16.565
Target marked

16:16.566 --> 16:19.728
But for more than 100 miles out
you can't possibly...

16:21.438 --> 16:23.659
eat your ***, Hawkeye.

17:02.778 --> 17:04.162
How perfect

17:04.163 --> 17:06.862
Tha last attempt at salvation.

17:06.863 --> 17:09.392
Gloriously *** by the most...

17:09.393 --> 17:11.692
unlikely of adversary.

17:11.693 --> 17:14.742
I've waited so long.

17:18.295 --> 17:20.567
Show yourself coward!

17:30.222 --> 17:31.934
Red Skull!

17:32.542 --> 17:37.392
And so, we've come full circle,
Captain America.

17:39.454 --> 17:40.922
I wil crush you...

17:40.923 --> 17:43.223
and everything you hold dear...

17:43.224 --> 17:45.224
under my feet.

17:45.623 --> 17:47.073
Finish him.

17:49.054 --> 17:50.661
Do it.

17:57.403 --> 17:58.873
No.

18:01.825 --> 18:06.006
For your defiance, you have signed your death warrant.

18:11.782 --> 18:13.448
Look at me, Skull.

18:14.126 --> 18:16.683
You and I still have a score to settle.

18:52.385 --> 18:53.957
Nice ***.

19:32.403 --> 19:34.193
Just spoke to the SHIELD psych team.

19:34.194 --> 19:37.660
Falcon and Samson are gonna be treated for
whatever mind control the Skull had them under.

19:37.661 --> 19:40.559
Good, they are not the bad guys.

19:40.560 --> 19:43.544
Except the red monster i did battle with.

19:43.545 --> 19:45.317
He has not been seen since.

19:45.318 --> 19:47.150
Speaking of which, JARVIS reports...

19:47.151 --> 19:48.857
that the news *** Cap and the Skull...

19:48.858 --> 19:51.488
In the Pentagon lawn is being played worldwide.

19:51.489 --> 19:53.411
I hope they are looking on how exactly...

19:53.412 --> 19:55.544
a psychopatic HYDRA war criminal...

19:55.545 --> 19:58.234
could get appointed Secretary of Defense.

19:59.146 --> 20:01.230
I'll never understand politics.

20:01.231 --> 20:04.464
The important thing is that
all Rusk's public campaign against us...

20:04.465 --> 20:06.791
end up looking like the ranting of a mad man.

20:06.792 --> 20:08.367
It' good PR for us.

20:08.368 --> 20:10.382
And we all owe this man.

20:13.118 --> 20:14.433
Cap?

20:15.312 --> 20:17.876
Let him be Wasp.
After all he's been through...

20:17.877 --> 20:20.373
I just hope he hasn't forgotten
what's important.

20:20.374 --> 20:23.608
To him, and to the Avengers.

20:24.305 --> 20:30.541
