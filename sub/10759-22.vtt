00:07.507 --> 00:08.942
WOMAN:
What do you see here?

00:08.942 --> 00:10.510
DAPHNE:
It's two bunnies

00:10.510 --> 00:14.014
clawing each other to death
over a lima bean.

00:15.448 --> 00:17.884
Forgive me,
Dr. McCaskill,

00:17.884 --> 00:19.386
but this game seems
rather silly.

00:19.386 --> 00:21.388
I understand how you
might feel that way,

00:21.388 --> 00:23.356
but it's
helpful to me.

00:23.356 --> 00:24.324
Now, last one.

00:24.324 --> 00:26.793
It's a woman.

00:26.793 --> 00:28.695
Okay, then.

00:29.529 --> 00:33.066
She's skinning a pigeon
with a hatchet.

00:36.436 --> 00:38.872
Are we done now?

00:38.872 --> 00:41.808
I think we still
have some work to do.

00:41.808 --> 00:43.877
I just don't think
there's any good reason

00:43.877 --> 00:45.178
for me to be here.

00:45.178 --> 00:46.946
The judge felt differently.

00:46.946 --> 00:48.314
Oh, what does he know?

00:48.314 --> 00:50.150
Saying I need anger management.

00:50.150 --> 00:51.651
I'm not an angry person.

00:51.651 --> 00:53.420
I never have been.

00:53.420 --> 00:55.188
Daphne, wasn't it anger
that led you to cause

00:55.188 --> 00:56.556
that four-car accident?

00:56.556 --> 00:59.426
Oh, yes, but I was provoked
into that.

00:59.426 --> 01:02.228
Mm-hmm.
I'm not angry anymore.

01:02.228 --> 01:04.030
Well, there may be
a level of emotion

01:04.030 --> 01:05.532
you're not entirely
in touch with.

01:05.532 --> 01:08.034
Let's talk about
your life in general.

01:08.034 --> 01:09.502
You said you
had a fiancé?

01:09.502 --> 01:11.971
Yes, Donny.

01:11.971 --> 01:13.973
He's a wonderful, generous man.

01:13.973 --> 01:17.477
In fact, he did the sweetest
thing for me last week,

01:17.477 --> 01:18.978
totally out of the blue.

01:18.978 --> 01:21.981
PEOPLE:
Surprise!

01:23.583 --> 01:25.285
Welcome
to your shower,

01:25.285 --> 01:26.920
honey.

01:26.920 --> 01:28.254
Oh, my God,
you're trembling.

01:28.254 --> 01:32.025
Yes, well, I'm
absolutely blown away.

01:32.025 --> 01:33.259
Oh, come on Daphne.
You were on to us.

01:33.259 --> 01:34.828
No, really.

01:34.828 --> 01:37.197
You had me
completely fooled.

01:37.197 --> 01:40.066
We may have an even bigger
surprise for you later on.

01:40.066 --> 01:42.001
Oh? Yes, but
first things first.

01:42.001 --> 01:44.404
Let's get you
some champagne.

01:44.404 --> 01:46.973
DAPHNE: I'm not usually much
for surprise parties,

01:46.973 --> 01:49.476
but I could see
how much trouble Donny went to.

01:49.476 --> 01:52.479
He invited all my friends,
made the food.

01:52.479 --> 01:54.481
He even planned some games.

01:54.481 --> 01:57.484
We played this one game
where everyone's in groups,

01:57.484 --> 01:59.486
then each group
dresses one person

01:59.486 --> 02:01.488
in a bridal gown
made out of toilet paper.

02:01.488 --> 02:03.490
Can't remember
what it's called.

02:03.490 --> 02:05.992
"Toilet Paper
Bridal Gown."

02:05.992 --> 02:08.495
Yes, that's it.
Have you played?

02:08.495 --> 02:10.997
I'm familiar
with it.

02:10.997 --> 02:12.465
Then, you know, as the bride,

02:12.465 --> 02:15.001
I had to judge
which group made the best dress

02:15.502 --> 02:17.003
while another woman
was in charge of...

02:17.003 --> 02:18.505
(whistle blows)

02:18.505 --> 02:21.975
Time! Stop right now
or be disqualified!

02:21.975 --> 02:24.511
Designers, present
your brides.

02:24.511 --> 02:25.778
Team A.

02:25.778 --> 02:28.414
Ta-da!

02:28.414 --> 02:30.817
Oh, very nice, Donny.

02:30.817 --> 02:32.552
Team B.

02:32.552 --> 02:34.354
We're not finished yet.

02:34.354 --> 02:35.355
You shouldn't
have spent

02:35.355 --> 02:37.857
so much time
with the sketches.

02:37.857 --> 02:39.125
MEL:
Team C.

02:39.125 --> 02:40.860
Where's Team C?
Team C, time!

02:40.860 --> 02:45.732
(humming "Bridal March")

02:47.667 --> 02:49.002
You'll notice

02:49.002 --> 02:51.337
that I used the quilted variety
for the bodice

02:51.337 --> 02:53.206
and the edging
on the veil.

02:53.206 --> 02:56.109
Well, you all look fantastic,

02:56.109 --> 02:58.845
but I think we have a winner--
Team C.

02:58.845 --> 03:02.549
(Team C cheering)

03:02.549 --> 03:04.417
Oh, Donny, I'm sorry.

03:04.417 --> 03:05.919
Holly, it's
not your fault.

03:05.919 --> 03:09.322
I should have
been more radiant.

03:09.322 --> 03:10.757
Daphne, listen, if
there happens to be

03:10.757 --> 03:12.692
another game that we play, do you
think you could arrange for me

03:12.692 --> 03:14.661
to be on the same team as
your friend Holly there?

03:15.161 --> 03:16.162
Oh, developed
a little crush, have we?

03:16.162 --> 03:17.564
As a matter of
fact, I have.

03:17.564 --> 03:18.965
It's just that I haven't
had much of a chance

03:18.965 --> 03:19.966
to get to speak
with her at all.

03:20.466 --> 03:21.801
Well, I'll do what I can,

03:21.801 --> 03:23.102
but I'm not really
in charge here.

03:23.102 --> 03:24.604
(blows whistle)

03:24.604 --> 03:26.105
All right, people.

03:26.105 --> 03:27.640
Next game,
bridal charades.

03:27.640 --> 03:29.642
(guests moaning and cheering)
(doorbell ringing)

03:29.642 --> 03:31.077
Oh, oh!

03:31.077 --> 03:32.445
Roz, you know, someday
you're going to make

03:33.012 --> 03:34.013
a beautiful bride.

03:34.013 --> 03:36.849
'Course, your dress won't be
made out of toilet paper.

03:36.849 --> 03:38.084
Or be white.

03:38.084 --> 03:40.019
DONNY:
Everybody.

03:40.019 --> 03:41.521
Daphne...

03:41.521 --> 03:44.290
your big surprise
has arrived.

03:44.290 --> 03:46.059
Now, this is someone
that I know

03:46.059 --> 03:47.894
that you are dying
to see.

03:47.894 --> 03:49.562
Your parents?

03:49.562 --> 03:51.231
No, not till next week.

03:51.231 --> 03:52.966
My mother?

03:52.966 --> 03:54.234
No, someone good.

03:55.902 --> 03:56.736
My brother?

03:56.736 --> 03:58.571
Your favorite brother.

03:58.571 --> 04:00.240
Oh...

04:00.240 --> 04:02.008
Yay! Stephen!

04:02.008 --> 04:03.876
Ste... No.

04:04.777 --> 04:06.179
Billy.

04:06.179 --> 04:07.113
Um...

04:07.113 --> 04:08.581
DAPHNE:
Michael? Well...

04:08.581 --> 04:09.949
Nigel? David?

04:09.949 --> 04:11.284
MAN:
Hello.

04:11.284 --> 04:12.952
Thirsty man
waiting out here.

04:14.287 --> 04:15.121
Simon.

04:16.456 --> 04:17.457
Hello.

04:17.457 --> 04:19.959
Daphne... come here.

04:19.959 --> 04:22.262
Ah! I got you again!

04:23.930 --> 04:25.698
Everyone,

04:25.698 --> 04:27.100
this is my
brother, Simon.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.534
ALL:
Hi, Simon.

04:28.534 --> 04:30.870
Ah, Stilts,
aren't you a sight?

04:30.870 --> 04:32.205
"Stilts"?

04:32.205 --> 04:34.107
Growing up, I was a
bit tall for my age.

04:34.107 --> 04:36.676
Giant, like she was
on stilts.

04:36.676 --> 04:38.177
They follow you, Simon.

04:38.177 --> 04:39.579
Yeah, right.

04:39.579 --> 04:41.381
Well, it's nice
to meet you all,

04:41.381 --> 04:43.583
especially whichever one's
the bartender.

04:43.583 --> 04:45.785
Oh, that would be me.

04:45.785 --> 04:48.154
Oh, and a pretty
little bartender you are.

04:48.154 --> 04:49.489
Right this way.

04:49.489 --> 04:50.456
After you.

04:50.456 --> 04:51.958
Oh.

04:51.958 --> 04:54.460
I'd rather walk
behind you, anyway.

04:54.460 --> 04:55.962
I just love
your accent.

04:55.962 --> 04:57.463
It's so
sophisticated.

04:57.463 --> 05:00.833
Oh, right.

05:04.871 --> 05:07.440
DONNY: Oh, boy,
I really screwed up, didn't I?

05:07.874 --> 05:09.442
Isn't Stephen the
favorite brother?

05:09.942 --> 05:10.843
Yes. Even I knew that,

05:10.843 --> 05:12.512
and I barely listen to her.

05:12.512 --> 05:13.813
I know, I know, I know.

05:13.813 --> 05:14.814
I got the names mixed up,

05:14.814 --> 05:16.316
but you have mentioned
Simon, too.

05:16.316 --> 05:17.817
Yeah, as a freeloader
who just sits

05:17.817 --> 05:19.252
around the house
drinking beer all day.

05:19.252 --> 05:20.586
Well, that's a lot of people.

05:20.586 --> 05:21.988
You're retired.

05:24.390 --> 05:26.859
You have
such a dirty mind.

05:26.859 --> 05:28.361
And that would be

05:28.361 --> 05:31.230
a terrible
thing to waste.

05:32.098 --> 05:33.599
Uh, Simon...

05:33.599 --> 05:35.034
Yeah, right.

05:35.034 --> 05:36.536
This is Dr.
Frasier Crane

05:36.536 --> 05:37.537
and his father,
Martin.

05:37.537 --> 05:39.038
Oh, yeah.
Pleasure to meet you.

05:39.038 --> 05:40.073
Simon, how are you?

05:40.073 --> 05:41.074
Pleasure to meet you.

05:41.074 --> 05:42.575
These are the
people I work for.

05:42.575 --> 05:44.577
And you've met
my fiancé, Donny.

05:44.577 --> 05:46.512
Oh, thanks
for flying me over.

05:46.512 --> 05:47.447
Yeah, about that...

05:47.447 --> 05:49.382
Didn't it seem unusual to you

05:49.382 --> 05:50.950
when he called you
my favorite brother?

05:50.950 --> 05:53.453
Mm. Now that you mention it,

05:53.453 --> 05:55.722
it did strike my ear
as a bit odd,

05:55.722 --> 05:57.490
you being so partial
to Stephen.

05:57.490 --> 05:58.991
But then I thought,

05:58.991 --> 06:00.993
women change their minds
all the time.

06:00.993 --> 06:03.396
Brothers fall
in and out of favor.

06:03.396 --> 06:05.565
Maybe it's my turn.

06:05.565 --> 06:06.833
And a good thing, too,

06:06.833 --> 06:08.835
as it was
an especially good time

06:08.835 --> 06:11.304
for me to get out of England.

06:13.573 --> 06:16.709
God, he talks
just like a prince.

06:18.878 --> 06:21.647
So, uh, Simon,

06:21.647 --> 06:23.583
where are you staying?
Thanks, mate.

06:23.583 --> 06:25.084
Uh, Donny here says

06:25.084 --> 06:26.919
that Frasier's offered
to put me up.

06:26.919 --> 06:27.787
Yes, well, I mean,
when he told me

06:27.787 --> 06:29.589
that he was inviting
Daphne's favorite brother,

06:29.589 --> 06:31.290
I-I didn't hesitate.

06:31.290 --> 06:32.158
'Course, well, the sad truth is,

06:32.158 --> 06:33.559
we don't really have
a bed for you.

06:33.559 --> 06:35.862
Oh, a couch will
suit me just fine.

06:35.862 --> 06:38.264
Well, I mean, you wouldn't
really be comfortable there

06:38.264 --> 06:39.599
for more than a day or two.

06:39.599 --> 06:40.933
Oh, don't worry about that.

06:40.933 --> 06:42.935
I once slept on a couch
for three months

06:42.935 --> 06:45.271
before I even realized
it pulled out.

06:47.473 --> 06:49.308
The main thing is
that I spend

06:49.308 --> 06:51.811
as much time as possible
with my baby sister!

06:52.311 --> 06:54.313
Oh! Simon, look
what you did!

06:54.814 --> 06:56.816
It was my absolute
favorite dress--

06:56.816 --> 06:58.818
one I save
for special occasions.

06:58.818 --> 07:00.820
He wasn't in the door
five minutes

07:00.820 --> 07:01.821
before he ruined it.

07:01.821 --> 07:03.823
And yet you still
felt responsible

07:03.823 --> 07:05.324
for putting him up.

07:05.324 --> 07:06.826
I didn't have
much choice.

07:06.826 --> 07:07.827
If I turned him out,

07:07.827 --> 07:09.662
I'd never hear the end
of it from Mum.

07:09.662 --> 07:11.497
I'm hearing that your relatives
are a source

07:11.497 --> 07:13.266
of some anger for you.

07:13.266 --> 07:15.435
So? Aren't yours?

07:15.435 --> 07:17.837
Well, they might be if I
still talked to any of them.

07:21.207 --> 07:23.509
Anyway, uh...

07:23.509 --> 07:25.745
I can see how

07:25.745 --> 07:27.713
your brother's presence
was adding stress,

07:27.713 --> 07:28.714
but what I'm
not sure of

07:28.714 --> 07:30.216
is how you got
from there

07:30.216 --> 07:32.718
to causing a
four-car pileup.

07:32.718 --> 07:35.188
DAPHNE: Well, things got
much more difficult

07:35.188 --> 07:38.124
once Simon settled
into the house.

07:41.928 --> 07:43.329
Good evening, Dr. Crane.

07:43.329 --> 07:45.331
I hope you had a pleasant day.

07:45.331 --> 07:47.800
Where's Simon?

07:49.802 --> 07:51.804
I think he's out
with Mr. Crane again.

07:51.804 --> 07:54.307
They seem to have taken quite
a shine to each other.

07:54.307 --> 07:56.309
Simon's introduced
him to rugby.

07:56.742 --> 07:58.244
Yes, I really must
thank him for that.

07:58.244 --> 08:01.614
After all, poor Dad,
before he came,

08:01.614 --> 08:02.882
had no sport to watch

08:02.882 --> 08:06.385
between the hours
of 2:00 and 6:00 a.m.

08:08.154 --> 08:09.422
Did you happen to see
the kitchen this morning?

08:09.422 --> 08:12.358
Yes. I guess they
got some take-out.

08:12.358 --> 08:16.195
It looked like a kung pao bomb
went off.

08:16.195 --> 08:18.064
I still have moo shu

08:18.064 --> 08:21.067
stuck in the tread
of my driving moccasins.

08:22.068 --> 08:25.404
I'm sorry Simon's been
such an imposition,

08:25.404 --> 08:27.206
but he's leaving soon.

08:27.206 --> 08:29.709
He's decided to tour the
West Coast until the wedding.

08:29.709 --> 08:30.710
Oh, Lord,
that's a relief.

08:30.710 --> 08:33.578
Yes...
(sighs): Oh...

08:33.578 --> 08:34.947
Oh, by the by,

08:34.947 --> 08:37.450
I invited my friend Holly over
for drinks tonight.

08:37.950 --> 08:39.217
Maybe you could join us.

08:39.217 --> 08:40.520
Might give you two
an opportunity

08:40.520 --> 08:42.355
to get better acquainted.

08:42.355 --> 08:44.190
Daphne, if you're offering up
your attractive friend

08:44.190 --> 08:46.959
as some sort of a peace
offering, well, then, I accept.

08:46.959 --> 08:48.194
Perhaps I'd
better go

08:48.194 --> 08:50.062
and make myself
irresistible.

08:50.062 --> 08:51.130
Well, you won't
have time for much.

08:51.130 --> 08:53.533
She's on her way now. Well,
it's probably better that way.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.801
You know, give her
a fighting chance.

08:57.036 --> 08:58.804
Mr. Crane,

08:58.804 --> 09:00.072
I thought
you were out with Simon.

09:00.072 --> 09:01.541
Nope, just Eddie.

09:01.541 --> 09:02.842
Then where's Simon?

09:02.842 --> 09:04.076
FRASIER:
Daphne!

09:04.076 --> 09:06.546
Your brother
is in my bed!

09:06.546 --> 09:09.549
Nude!

09:09.549 --> 09:12.552
Simon Moon, get
out of Dr. Crane's room!

09:12.552 --> 09:13.953
MARTIN:
Oh, that poor guy.

09:13.953 --> 09:15.855
He probably just needed a nap.

09:15.855 --> 09:16.856
It's the jet lag.

09:16.856 --> 09:18.691
Couple of days,
and he'll be on our time.

09:18.691 --> 09:20.826
A couple more days,
he'll be on our sidewalk.

09:20.826 --> 09:22.662
Oh, sorry about that.

09:22.662 --> 09:25.031
I'm a bit sleepy today.

09:25.031 --> 09:27.433
I think I'm coming down
with a cold.

09:27.433 --> 09:30.202
(clearing throat
and sniffling)

09:33.239 --> 09:36.576
Nothing another night of
drinking won't cure, I'm sure.

09:36.576 --> 09:37.944
Well, let's hope.

09:39.445 --> 09:41.280
Is that my robe you're wearing?

09:41.280 --> 09:42.582
Yeah, yeah.
You want it back?

09:42.582 --> 09:44.350
No, no.

09:44.350 --> 09:45.117
It's all right.

09:45.117 --> 09:46.485
I got shorts underneath.
FRASIER: Oh, God.

09:46.485 --> 09:47.887
Are those my shorts?

09:47.887 --> 09:49.355
Well, I didn't
think you'd mind.

09:49.355 --> 09:52.124
I found them on
the bathroom floor.

09:57.163 --> 09:59.632
Look, if you
need to lie down,

09:59.632 --> 10:00.666
you can use my room.

10:00.666 --> 10:01.667
Yeah, well, all
right, yeah.

10:01.667 --> 10:02.635
Don't forget to
wake me for dinner.

10:02.635 --> 10:04.604
I woke you for lunch, didn't I?

10:04.604 --> 10:07.039
Yeah, right.

10:07.039 --> 10:08.407
(doorbell ringing)

10:08.407 --> 10:09.775
Oh, dear God,
that'll be Holly.

10:09.775 --> 10:12.211
Dad, please,
make yourself scarce.

10:14.447 --> 10:16.849
Ah, Holly,
hello again.

10:16.849 --> 10:18.718
Hello, Dr. Crane.
Nice to see you again.

10:18.718 --> 10:20.386
Yes, yes,
Uh, please, call me Frasier.

10:20.386 --> 10:21.687
Come on in.
Hi, Holly.

10:21.687 --> 10:23.189
I'm glad you
could make it.

10:23.189 --> 10:25.191
Me, too. My boss can be
such a pain.

10:25.191 --> 10:26.692
Oh, too bad.

10:26.692 --> 10:29.662
This one here keeps me
in stitches all day long.

10:30.663 --> 10:33.165
Wocka-wocka!

10:34.634 --> 10:36.135
Let me bring you girls
some drinks.

10:36.135 --> 10:37.136
Oh, no, no, no,

10:37.136 --> 10:38.638
let me get them.

10:38.638 --> 10:39.605
Could you keep Holly company?

10:39.605 --> 10:41.907
All right, uh...
Well, Holly...

10:41.907 --> 10:42.808
um, please
have a seat.

10:42.808 --> 10:44.810
Uh, gosh, uh...

10:44.810 --> 10:45.811
you know, we
didn't really get

10:45.811 --> 10:47.313
much of a chance to
talk at the shower,

10:47.313 --> 10:49.315
but, uh, let me see...

10:49.315 --> 10:51.183
You're in the music
business, aren't you?

10:51.183 --> 10:53.052
Yes. Right now, I'm planning

10:53.052 --> 10:54.920
a reggae festival
on Mercer Island.

10:54.920 --> 10:56.789
Oh, well, I'll have
to remind myself

10:56.789 --> 11:01.060
to take the rasta-ferry
over to catch it.

11:04.397 --> 11:06.732
Frasier just told
the cutest little joke.

11:06.732 --> 11:07.733
Oh, I'm sorry.

11:07.733 --> 11:10.069
I came back
as quickly as I could.

11:11.370 --> 11:12.805
Oh, I just remembered
I left a tray

11:12.805 --> 11:14.674
of hors d'oeuvres
on the kitchen counter.

11:14.674 --> 11:16.042
Oh, no, let
me, Daphne.

11:16.042 --> 11:17.510
I'm not going to let you
wait on me all night.

11:17.510 --> 11:19.545
DAPHNE:
Well, thank you.

11:19.545 --> 11:22.381
Allow me.
Well?

11:22.381 --> 11:24.216
Well, I like her.
Actually, you know what?

11:24.216 --> 11:25.718
I think she likes me, too.

11:25.718 --> 11:28.554
So, are you going to ask her out?
Oh, now, now, Daphne.

11:28.554 --> 11:31.390
Can't rush things
with a girl like Holly.

11:31.390 --> 11:32.892
After all,
she's the kind of girl

11:32.892 --> 11:33.893
you just don't
do that to.

11:33.893 --> 11:35.394
She has to be wooed.

11:35.394 --> 11:36.395
You know, to be honest,

11:36.395 --> 11:37.897
this is the-the part
of the dance

11:37.897 --> 11:41.267
that excites me
the most--

11:41.267 --> 11:44.537
the coy
verbal volleys,

11:44.537 --> 11:46.806
the subtle
body language,

11:46.806 --> 11:47.740
the probing glances

11:47.740 --> 11:51.744
as we explore
our mutual passion.

11:51.744 --> 11:54.547
Um... that jacket
you're wearing

11:54.547 --> 11:56.382
might be a bit
too conservative. Really?

11:56.382 --> 11:57.817
Why don't you go and change?
Well, all right, all right.

11:57.817 --> 12:00.786
What do you think, maybe-maybe,
uh, maybe a sweater?

12:00.786 --> 12:02.288
Do you think I'd look
more freewheeling

12:02.288 --> 12:05.091
in my blue and my...?

12:07.193 --> 12:08.994
Good God.

12:08.994 --> 12:12.998
He has a cold, you know.

12:20.106 --> 12:22.108
I had no idea
that Simon and Holly

12:22.108 --> 12:24.110
had gotten so cozy
at my wedding shower.

12:24.110 --> 12:26.612
Of course, try telling that
to Dr. Crane.

12:26.612 --> 12:28.114
He blamed you for
what happened?

12:28.114 --> 12:29.081
Of course he did.

12:29.081 --> 12:31.617
The tension in the house
was just getting worse.

12:31.617 --> 12:33.619
Then two nights later,

12:33.619 --> 12:36.622
I thought I was getting
a break from it all.

12:36.622 --> 12:39.625
I had the house all to myself
for a change,

12:39.625 --> 12:41.127
which was a good thing,

12:41.127 --> 12:43.129
because I was meeting
Donny's parents the next day.

12:43.129 --> 12:45.631
I decided I'd use the evening

12:45.631 --> 12:49.135
to take a nice hot bath,
give myself a manicure...

12:49.135 --> 12:51.904
you know, how you do.

12:54.073 --> 12:56.909
Dr. Crane, what happened
to your concert?

12:56.909 --> 12:59.779
Simon happened.

12:59.779 --> 13:02.114
I've caught his wretched cold.

13:02.114 --> 13:04.817
I'm just going to go
curl up in bed.

13:04.817 --> 13:08.587
After all, if I don't take
care of myself, who will?

13:08.587 --> 13:10.623
Make me some tea and honey,
won't you?

13:12.424 --> 13:14.760
Hey, Daph.

13:14.760 --> 13:16.629
I thought you and Simon
were watching the game

13:16.629 --> 13:17.530
down at McGinty's.

13:17.530 --> 13:18.931
Nah, the cable went out.

13:18.931 --> 13:20.800
I'll just watch it here.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.101
Then where's Simon?

13:22.101 --> 13:23.969
He's at the bar.
He met some people.

13:23.969 --> 13:26.405
Oh, listen, if you're
going in the kitchen,

13:26.405 --> 13:27.940
would you get me
a beer?

13:27.940 --> 13:28.874
He's got
a real knack

13:28.874 --> 13:30.276
for making friends...

13:30.276 --> 13:32.278
and a great storyteller.

13:32.278 --> 13:34.280
Is it true you wet your pants

13:34.280 --> 13:37.049
the first time
you saw a Chinese person?

13:37.850 --> 13:39.718
He told you that?

13:39.718 --> 13:41.120
Oh, he's going to kill me.

13:41.120 --> 13:44.456
He was going to try to work it
into his wedding toast.

13:46.125 --> 13:47.493
(shouting
and laughter)

13:47.493 --> 13:49.495
Come on in, make yourselves
comfortable.

13:49.962 --> 13:50.963
Hey, Stilts,

13:50.963 --> 13:52.364
I didn't know
you'd be home.

13:52.364 --> 13:54.033
God, what a sight.

13:54.033 --> 13:55.467
If you took your teeth out
and put them in your pocket,

13:55.467 --> 13:57.870
you'd look like Mum.

13:57.870 --> 14:00.639
Oh, sod off, Simon.

14:00.639 --> 14:01.974
Who are these people?

14:01.974 --> 14:02.908
These are some
new friends of mine.

14:02.908 --> 14:04.410
They've come 'round
to watch the game.

14:04.410 --> 14:06.912
This is Dan.
This is, uh...

14:06.912 --> 14:08.414
Judd.
Judd, yeah.

14:08.414 --> 14:09.915
And this here
is Paris.

14:09.915 --> 14:10.749
MARTIN:
Oh, Paris--

14:10.749 --> 14:11.884
does that make you French?

14:11.884 --> 14:13.686
No, but a couple
of beers might.

14:13.686 --> 14:15.154
Brilliant! Brilliant!

14:15.154 --> 14:16.655
(laughter)

14:16.655 --> 14:18.958
What on earth
is going on out here?

14:18.958 --> 14:19.792
Oh, it's no big deal.

14:19.792 --> 14:21.260
A few people just came over
to watch the game.

14:21.260 --> 14:23.495
Well, you might have consulted
with me first.

14:23.495 --> 14:25.331
Let's get you back to bed,
Dr. Crane.

14:25.331 --> 14:27.199
I'll bring your tea
in a minute. Very well, Daphne.

14:27.199 --> 14:29.535
It seems I've caught
a cold from someone.

14:29.535 --> 14:31.003
Well, you might've
mentioned that

14:31.003 --> 14:33.272
before I took a nap
in your bed.

14:34.506 --> 14:37.743
If you don't mind
me saying, Marty,

14:37.743 --> 14:39.578
you're a saint
for putting up with that man.

14:40.079 --> 14:43.849
Your life must be very trying,
very trying indeed.

14:43.849 --> 14:46.952
Oh, do not get me started.

14:46.952 --> 14:48.654
(doorbell rings)

14:48.654 --> 14:49.989
Could someone get that?

14:49.989 --> 14:51.824
I have a tray to make
for Dr. Crane.

14:51.824 --> 14:53.993
Bring out some beers,
would you?

14:56.562 --> 14:59.064
Hi, Simon.
Hello.

15:00.065 --> 15:03.068
Are you ready?
To go to dinner?

15:03.068 --> 15:04.870
We made a date.

15:04.870 --> 15:06.672
Of course. Our date.

15:06.672 --> 15:09.608
Uh, just-just hang on there
a minute, uh...

15:09.608 --> 15:10.476
Hello, Roz.

15:10.476 --> 15:11.210
Roz, yeah.

15:11.210 --> 15:12.878
I forgot where
I put me jacket.

15:12.878 --> 15:14.713
Right here.
Right.

15:14.713 --> 15:16.215
Well, I'm just going out
for a bit, love.

15:16.215 --> 15:20.152
Make yourself comfortable.
I won't be late.

15:23.055 --> 15:24.056
I don't believe this.

15:24.056 --> 15:26.091
I got dressed up,
I got a sitter,

15:26.091 --> 15:27.593
and you don't even remember
we made a date.

15:27.593 --> 15:30.029
Some classy brother,
Daphne.

15:30.029 --> 15:31.463
Now you're making me feel bad.

15:31.463 --> 15:34.833
I'll tell you what--
dinner's on me tonight.

15:36.135 --> 15:38.837
Daphne, can I talk to you
for a minute?

15:38.837 --> 15:40.606
Don't bother, Simon.

15:40.606 --> 15:42.041
Hey, will you keep it down?
The game's on.

15:42.041 --> 15:44.009
Right. Daph, how about
some snacks?

15:44.009 --> 15:45.711
Maybe a couple of sandwiches.

15:45.711 --> 15:46.946
Oh, get it yourself.

15:46.946 --> 15:49.415
I have laundry to check on.

15:49.415 --> 15:51.417
Hey, did you do
my delicates?

15:51.417 --> 15:52.885
(huffs)

15:52.885 --> 15:54.887
I thought I'd cool off

15:54.887 --> 15:58.424
while I was in the laundry room,
but no such luck.

15:58.424 --> 16:00.225
Look at this!

16:00.225 --> 16:03.495
My favorite dress
ruined!

16:03.495 --> 16:05.831
(loud cheering)

16:05.831 --> 16:07.099
Just when I'd gotten
the wine stain out,

16:07.099 --> 16:09.601
someone pulled it
out of the machine

16:09.601 --> 16:11.603
and tossed it
into a puddle of bleach.

16:11.603 --> 16:13.672
(loud cheering)

16:13.672 --> 16:15.074
I got them back, though.

16:15.074 --> 16:16.976
I pulled all their clothes
out of the dryer

16:16.976 --> 16:19.945
and threw them
onto the dirty, wet floor.

16:19.945 --> 16:22.247
Oh, what do
you care?

16:22.247 --> 16:24.583
I need a drink-- a big one.

16:24.583 --> 16:25.918
(doorbell rings)

16:25.918 --> 16:27.753
Oh, that'll be
my date again.

16:27.753 --> 16:29.521
I knew she couldn't
stay mad long.

16:30.356 --> 16:33.092
Coming, Rose!

16:34.460 --> 16:36.462
Hi. Hello, Donny.
Who's this, then?

16:36.962 --> 16:38.464
My Mom and Dad-- I was
picking them up at the airport.

16:38.464 --> 16:39.965
They couldn't wait
to meet Daphne.

16:39.965 --> 16:40.833
This is Simon,

16:40.833 --> 16:41.767
Daphne's brother.

16:41.767 --> 16:43.102
Oh, nice to meet you.
Yeah, hello.

16:43.102 --> 16:43.969
How are you?

16:43.969 --> 16:45.337
Hey, word
to the wise:

16:45.337 --> 16:47.606
Daphne's in a bit
of a mood tonight.

16:47.606 --> 16:49.408
Why don't I just let her know
that you're here?

16:49.408 --> 16:51.243
There. That's the last
of that bottle.

16:52.978 --> 16:54.213
Daphne, thanks for
bringing in my whiskey.

16:54.213 --> 16:55.214
It's mine--
if you want it,

16:55.214 --> 16:56.715
you'll have to fight me
for it, old man.

16:56.715 --> 16:58.784
Honey, honey...

16:58.784 --> 17:00.986
Um, Mom, Dad, uh...

17:00.986 --> 17:02.454
(chuckles nervously)

17:05.257 --> 17:06.558
This is my fiancée...

17:06.558 --> 17:07.559
(chuckles)

17:07.559 --> 17:09.560
Daphne.

17:09.560 --> 17:10.863
Hello.

17:12.498 --> 17:14.833
Donny, I thought we were
doing this tomorrow.

17:14.833 --> 17:16.268
Well, I wanted
to surprise you.

17:16.268 --> 17:17.336
Why, because your
last surprise

17:17.336 --> 17:20.105
worked out so well?

17:20.105 --> 17:22.307
We should have called
first.

17:22.307 --> 17:24.209
This is so embarrassing.
I'm such a mess.

17:24.209 --> 17:25.711
Come on, honey,
you've looked worse.

17:25.711 --> 17:27.179
Donny!

17:27.179 --> 17:28.113
Maybe we'd
better go.

17:28.113 --> 17:30.115
Oh, no, no,
please come in.

17:30.115 --> 17:31.617
The more, the merrier.

17:31.617 --> 17:32.484
(doorbell rings)

17:32.484 --> 17:33.452
Oh, for God's sake,

17:33.452 --> 17:35.454
who the hell is that now?

17:35.454 --> 17:39.725
She's very lovely.

17:39.725 --> 17:41.894
I know what you did.

17:41.894 --> 17:44.663
Someone saw you leave
the laundry room.

17:44.663 --> 17:47.466
You threw all my wet clothes
all over the floor!

17:47.466 --> 17:49.968
Oh, I'm sorry.

17:49.968 --> 17:52.337
I didn't realize
they were still wet.

17:52.337 --> 17:54.706
Here... let me help.

17:54.706 --> 17:55.707
What are you doing?

17:55.707 --> 17:58.477
Ooh-hoo,
that's nice and hot.

17:58.477 --> 17:59.611
WOMAN:
Stop it!

17:59.611 --> 18:01.380
What, not fast enough
for you? Here!

18:01.380 --> 18:02.381
WOMAN:
Stop it!

18:02.381 --> 18:04.349
Maybe if we air-dried them!

18:05.217 --> 18:07.219
There...!

18:08.187 --> 18:09.655
That should do it!

18:09.655 --> 18:11.156
You happy now?!

18:11.156 --> 18:15.561
(horns honking)
(tires screeching)

18:15.561 --> 18:17.429
(cars crashing)

18:20.899 --> 18:26.171
Fine! I guess I'll just
have to make my own tea!

18:27.673 --> 18:29.174
It never occurred to me

18:29.174 --> 18:31.677
that stuff would fall
on people's windshields.

18:31.677 --> 18:33.178
Well, I can
certainly see

18:33.178 --> 18:34.146
why you felt provoked.

18:34.146 --> 18:35.681
Thank you.

18:35.681 --> 18:38.183
Now, if the judge
had seen it your way,

18:38.183 --> 18:40.185
we could have all saved
ourselves a lot of time.

18:40.185 --> 18:42.688
There's something
that confuses me

18:42.688 --> 18:44.089
just a little.

18:44.089 --> 18:45.424
Yes?

18:45.424 --> 18:47.392
This dress that was ruined--

18:47.392 --> 18:49.294
you keep saying
it was your favorite.

18:49.294 --> 18:51.730
That's right.

18:51.730 --> 18:52.664
So...

18:52.664 --> 18:55.534
why were you wearing it
at your bridal shower?

18:55.534 --> 18:58.370
Well, it's a momentous event,
don't you think?

18:58.370 --> 19:00.572
But you said it
was a surprise.

19:00.572 --> 19:02.875
Well, yes...

19:02.875 --> 19:04.776
it was.

19:04.776 --> 19:07.646
So... just what
were you expecting

19:07.646 --> 19:09.047
when you went over there?

19:12.451 --> 19:13.952
Daphne. Right on time.

19:14.453 --> 19:15.454
I'm glad you're here.

19:15.454 --> 19:16.455
Come in.

19:17.456 --> 19:20.459
Let me, uh,
take your coat.

19:20.459 --> 19:22.461
I brought the recipe.

19:22.461 --> 19:23.962
Hmm?

19:23.962 --> 19:26.965
Oh, uh, uh, for, uh,
sticky toffee pudding.

19:26.965 --> 19:28.467
Mm, mm, mm.

19:28.467 --> 19:30.936
Well, that's why
I'm here, isn't it?

19:30.936 --> 19:33.438
To teach you
to make it?

19:33.438 --> 19:35.440
Yes.

19:36.842 --> 19:38.210
You're not buying it,
are you?

19:38.210 --> 19:40.412
No, not really.

19:40.412 --> 19:42.748
So, uh...

19:42.748 --> 19:44.750
you know why
I asked you here tonight?

19:44.750 --> 19:46.652
I think I do.

19:46.652 --> 19:49.054
I mean, when a man
asks you to his house

19:49.555 --> 19:52.491
to make pudding on a
Saturday night, you...

19:52.491 --> 19:54.760
Pretty flimsy excuse,
wasn't it?

19:54.760 --> 19:56.895
Well, it got me here.

19:56.895 --> 19:59.064
Well, I'm glad.

20:00.432 --> 20:01.900
Make yourself
comfortable.

20:01.900 --> 20:04.870
All right.

20:08.874 --> 20:12.177
ALL:
Surprise!

20:13.378 --> 20:15.080
DONNY:
Welcome to your shower, honey.

20:15.080 --> 20:16.715
(laughing)

20:16.715 --> 20:18.050
Oh, my God,
you're trembling.

20:18.050 --> 20:20.552
Yes, well... I'm
absolutely blown away.

20:21.053 --> 20:21.820
Oh, come on,
Daphne,

20:21.820 --> 20:23.121
you were on to us.

20:23.121 --> 20:26.625
No, really... you had
me completely fooled.

20:26.625 --> 20:28.627
(others laughing)

20:29.561 --> 20:32.130
My God...

20:32.130 --> 20:34.066
Dr. Crane...

20:34.066 --> 20:36.001
You know, it
might be time

20:36.001 --> 20:38.403
to start calling
him "Niles."

20:39.805 --> 20:42.341
This is so confusing.

20:42.341 --> 20:43.842
I mean, what about Donny?

20:43.842 --> 20:45.310
He's the man I love.

20:45.310 --> 20:47.546
Are you sure about that?

20:51.617 --> 20:54.620
No.

20:54.620 --> 20:57.623
Oh, I have so many questions.

20:57.623 --> 21:00.559
What does this mean?
What do I do?

21:02.494 --> 21:06.965
I'm sorry, but
our time is up.
