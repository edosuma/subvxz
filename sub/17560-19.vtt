Oh, my God, that was the saddest
song I've ever heard.

00:19.728 --> 00:21.229
Yeah, I'm gonna have to go home

00:21.312 --> 00:24.274
and watch "Schindler's List"
just to cheer up.

00:24.357 --> 00:27.444
Oh, my God, poor Ben.
He's heartbroken.

00:27.527 --> 00:30.488
What have I done
to that sweet, sweet man?

00:31.614 --> 00:33.575
- What's up, man?
- Hey, you guys.

00:33.658 --> 00:35.452
So, what did you think
of the new song?

00:35.535 --> 00:40.039
I call it "Love is impossible
and cruel, just kill me."

00:40.123 --> 00:42.333
Oh, my God, Ben, I am so sorry.

00:42.417 --> 00:45.879

the pain in your heart.

00:45.962 --> 00:49.841
I would give anything

01:03.855 --> 01:05.397
Well, so did you
ask her out yet?

01:05.482 --> 01:07.650
Oh, God, no.
She's way out of my league.

01:07.734 --> 01:09.152
Oh, I'm sure you think she is.

01:09.235 --> 01:10.987
Just like you thought
other girls you dated

01:11.070 --> 01:13.281
were out of your league.

01:13.364 --> 01:14.949

- Come on, not one?
- No.

01:18.119 --> 01:20.371

out of all the girls you--

01:20.455 --> 01:22.832
The boy said no.

01:22.916 --> 01:25.960
I want to ask Ava out,
but since a certain someone

01:26.044 --> 01:27.921
stomped all over my heart,
my confidence

01:28.004 --> 01:29.714
is at an all-time low.

01:30.924 --> 01:34.344
Oh, what a great title
for my next song.

01:34.427 --> 01:36.262

- Shut up.

- Helping you.

01:58.827 --> 02:01.037
So, Ava, sit.

02:01.120 --> 02:03.039
Ben, why don't you tell Ava

02:03.122 --> 02:05.250
how you're from England?

02:06.835 --> 02:09.503

was way out of his league.

05:38.087 --> 05:41.257
Well, he's dated
out of his league before.

05:41.340 --> 05:43.760
The difference is,
back then he had confidence.

But unfortunately, your drums
kinda can't be drumming

06:02.111 --> 06:04.113
or she won't mention
my bakery on her show.

06:04.197 --> 06:05.865
And then my business
will never take off

06:05.948 --> 06:08.534
and I could lose everything
and end up on the street.

06:10.536 --> 06:12.663
Not that that's a bad thing.

Same old story.

06:19.420 --> 06:21.547
Oh, drugs, alcohol.

06:21.631 --> 06:23.591
I was writing a novel.

06:23.674 --> 06:25.676
Poor bastard.

06:25.760 --> 06:26.969
What?

06:27.053 --> 06:29.305
A novel? That's amazing.

06:29.388 --> 06:31.808
Well, actually,
I haven't finished it yet.

06:31.891 --> 06:34.435
- Why not?
- I ran out of napkins.

06:36.020 --> 06:37.313
I just got stuck.

06:37.396 --> 06:40.608
It's hard to write

to burn it for warmth.

Oh, that's not funny. Sorry.

06:54.372 --> 06:57.083
You know what?
Um, we need another dishwasher.

06:57.166 --> 07:00.002
Uh, maybe if you'd like the job

07:00.086 --> 07:01.838
it'll help you get unstuck.

07:01.921 --> 07:03.131
And we have a really big sink.

07:03.214 --> 07:05.508
You could fit, like,
a whole person in there.

07:07.426 --> 07:08.845
It would be amazing

07:08.928 --> 07:11.139
to finally finish my novel.

07:11.222 --> 07:13.683
Is that it?

07:13.766 --> 07:16.769
Wow. You know, I'd love
to read what you have so far.

07:19.981 --> 07:23.109
Okay, it smells like a winner.

07:25.736 --> 07:28.030
Hey, I got your message.
What's the big emergency?

07:28.114 --> 07:29.699
I finally figured out
the perfect way

07:29.782 --> 07:31.200
to get Ben's confidence back.

07:31.284 --> 07:33.411
You want me to sleep with him?

07:33.494 --> 07:35.246
Tina, we've talked about this.

07:35.329 --> 07:36.539
When trying to solve problems

07:36.622 --> 07:39.208
we use our words,
not our lady parts.

07:39.292 --> 07:41.919
- I always forget that.
- I know.

07:42.003 --> 07:43.754
Okay, so I Googled
this Ava girl

07:43.838 --> 07:45.715
and, man, that girl
has a lot of web pages

07:45.798 --> 07:48.176
for somebody who's totally
in the same league as me.

07:48.259 --> 07:50.469
Anyway, she dates bad boys.

07:50.553 --> 07:53.556
The first guy was arrested,
and the other guy was in rehab.

07:53.639 --> 07:55.892
<i>[thinking]</i>
<i>I could</i>
<i>really go for a cupcake.</i>

07:57.310 --> 07:59.395
Tina, you're not even
listening to me.

07:59.478 --> 08:00.479
I am. Cupcake.

08:00.563 --> 08:02.481
Oh, bad boy.
Ava only dates bad boys?

08:02.565 --> 08:05.735
Exactly, so all we have to do
is turn Ben into a bad boy

08:05.818 --> 08:07.236
and then Ava will go
out with him and then

08:07.320 --> 08:08.613
Ben will get
his confidence back.

08:08.696 --> 08:10.198
Oh, I'd love to help you,
but I don't know

08:10.281 --> 08:12.658
how to get a guy arrested
now that I'm 18.

08:12.742 --> 08:14.076
Oh, maybe we should just
call Vince, he's got

08:14.160 --> 08:15.286
that whole "bad boy"
thing happening.

08:15.369 --> 08:17.330
No, Tina,
you know I can't call Vince.

08:17.413 --> 08:18.748
He made it very clear that
he doesn't want to see me

08:18.831 --> 08:20.333
unless I want
to be his girlfriend.

08:20.416 --> 08:22.460
You know, that was weeks ago.
I'm sure he's over it by now.

08:22.543 --> 08:25.588
No, Vince made it very clear
that he doesn't want to see me.

08:25.671 --> 08:27.632
I can't go there, Tina.

08:27.715 --> 08:29.091
Okay, fine, maybe you're right.

08:29.175 --> 08:31.594
Maybe it is better
if you just stay away from him.

08:31.677 --> 08:34.804
So what you're saying is,
I should go to him.

08:34.889 --> 08:36.474
- No, I--
- Shh.

08:36.557 --> 08:38.851
What you're saying is,
Ben is over me

08:38.934 --> 08:40.186
and if he got over me so easily

08:40.269 --> 08:41.729
that maybe Vince
got over me too.

08:41.812 --> 08:42.980
No, no, actually, I was saying--

08:43.063 --> 08:44.732
I know exactly
what you're saying.

08:44.815 --> 08:45.983
Since Vince is over me

08:46.067 --> 08:47.944
it's totally okay
that I go see him.

08:48.027 --> 08:51.280
The whole "girlfriend or
nothing" rule no longer applies.

08:51.364 --> 08:52.657
- No, Holly--
- Yes.

08:52.740 --> 08:55.409
Listen to what
you're saying, Tina.

08:55.493 --> 08:57.870
Not only can Vince
and I be friends again

08:57.954 --> 09:00.998
but I can help Ben too.
Everyone wins!

09:05.211 --> 09:07.880
- Hi.
- I knew it!

09:07.964 --> 09:09.924
I knew if I waited,
you'd come back to me!

09:10.007 --> 09:11.968
I knew it, I knew it!

09:12.051 --> 09:14.220
That's why you're here,
Holly, isn't it?

09:14.303 --> 09:17.223
- Isn't it?
- Um..

09:17.306 --> 09:19.558
I'm sorry. No.

09:23.729 --> 09:26.023
Why do I always listen to Tina?

09:34.073 --> 09:36.659
Hey. What the hell
is wrong with you?

09:36.742 --> 09:39.328
You gave that hobo a job
working in our bakery

09:39.412 --> 09:41.539
with clean people?

09:41.622 --> 09:42.957
His name is Jack.

09:43.040 --> 09:46.877
And hobo is about as PC
as midget or oriental.

09:47.920 --> 09:49.839
Oh, we can't say midget anymore?

09:49.922 --> 09:53.718
Hey, what about lollipop kid?

09:53.801 --> 09:56.596
Lauren, I think you're being
a little judgmental, okay?

09:56.679 --> 09:58.347
Jack is an educated man

09:58.431 --> 10:00.182
who happens to need a job.

10:00.266 --> 10:03.185
He's a scholar.
He wrote a brilliant novel.

10:03.269 --> 10:04.979
I was touched by this man.

10:05.062 --> 10:07.565
He touched you?

10:07.648 --> 10:09.775
Oh, my God,
well, we have to sue!

10:09.859 --> 10:13.070
Although, what are we really
gonna walk away with?

10:13.154 --> 10:14.530
You be nice.

10:14.613 --> 10:17.867
Okay, Val, I'm sorry,
look, my heart goes out to him

10:17.950 --> 10:19.160
but I just do not feel safe

10:19.243 --> 10:22.538
working side by side
with a vagrant.

10:22.621 --> 10:25.791
Ladies, ladies, ladies,
fresh from being snipped

10:25.875 --> 10:27.126
'clipped, and flea-dipped'

10:27.209 --> 10:29.754
I give you Jack,
the homeless guy.

10:35.468 --> 10:37.595
I could live in a box.

10:46.103 --> 10:47.730
Okay, let's rehearse this.

10:47.813 --> 10:49.649
Gary, bring in the cupcakes.

10:49.732 --> 10:52.818
[instrumental music]

11:04.330 --> 11:05.373
You know what?

11:05.456 --> 11:06.874
Maybe we should just
have the cupcakes

11:06.957 --> 11:09.502
already on the table
when we start.

11:09.585 --> 11:11.712
Well-well, then
I won't be in it.

11:11.796 --> 11:13.881
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

11:15.341 --> 11:17.385
Gary. You okay?

11:17.468 --> 11:19.261
[laughs]
Yeah, yeah.

11:19.345 --> 11:21.555
Yeah, I'm cool, I'm cool.
It's all good.

11:21.639 --> 11:23.349
It's all good.

11:23.432 --> 11:25.643
Why don't they want
me to be a star?

11:29.522 --> 11:31.565
- Hey!
- Where have you two been?

11:31.649 --> 11:34.944
Oh, I'm sorry. Uh, Jack
and I went on a lunch date.

11:35.027 --> 11:36.612
Yeah, we took the subway,
and he taught me

11:36.695 --> 11:38.697
how to jump the turnstile.

11:38.781 --> 11:40.449
- What?
- She is good.

11:40.533 --> 11:43.035
Oh, can't lie to you.

11:43.119 --> 11:45.246
It wasn't my first time.

11:47.123 --> 11:48.457
Okay, let's just, you know, um--

11:48.541 --> 11:50.459
Back to work, I know.

11:52.586 --> 11:53.712
So..

11:53.796 --> 11:54.922
You went out on a date
with Jack, huh?

11:55.005 --> 11:55.881
Mm-hmm.

11:55.965 --> 11:57.216
Thought you couldn't stand him.

11:57.299 --> 11:58.759
You said he was dirty
and disgusting.

11:58.843 --> 12:00.970
You ever hear
of a pet name, Val?

12:02.096 --> 12:04.140
I love him now.

12:06.267 --> 12:07.893
I cannot believe
you would do this to me.

12:07.977 --> 12:10.354
- Do what to you?
- You knew I liked him.

12:10.438 --> 12:12.189
No, you said you liked his novel

12:12.273 --> 12:14.817
which, thank God,
he did not talk about.

12:14.900 --> 12:17.027
You don't even appreciate
the real Jack.

12:17.111 --> 12:20.114
He is a sensitive,
artistic, intelligent soul.

12:20.197 --> 12:23.033
Oh, with a beautiful ass.

12:23.117 --> 12:24.452
You disgust me.

12:24.535 --> 12:25.828
Well, hey,
if you liked him so much

12:25.911 --> 12:27.079
why didn't you ask him out?

12:27.163 --> 12:28.747
Because I was gonna
take it slow.

12:28.831 --> 12:31.000
Hello? I've had a lot
of rejection this year.

12:31.083 --> 12:32.543
I thought maybe he would say no.

12:32.626 --> 12:34.962
He's homeless.

12:35.045 --> 12:37.423
He would've gone
for the meal alone.

12:39.049 --> 12:40.217
Okay, fine, you know
what I'm gonna do?

12:40.301 --> 12:41.343
I'm gonna go
ask him out on a date.

12:41.427 --> 12:42.720
No, no, he's mine

12:42.803 --> 12:44.763
and you've already had
a relationship this year, okay?

12:44.847 --> 12:46.182
Think of how long
it's been for me.

12:46.265 --> 12:48.601
- How long?
- I want to go out with a bum.

12:48.684 --> 12:50.352
That's how long!

12:52.313 --> 12:54.023
Well, I got stood up
at the altar.

12:54.106 --> 12:56.734
Oh, how long are you gonna
keep singing that song, sister?

12:56.817 --> 12:59.320
Oh, you're gonna be
the one who's singing

12:59.403 --> 13:00.696
at mine and Jack's wedding!

13:00.779 --> 13:01.822
[gasps]

13:04.700 --> 13:06.702
Great. Now who's gonna
do the segment?

13:06.785 --> 13:09.872
[instrumental music]

13:20.674 --> 13:23.135
I can't believe that
you gave me such bad advice.

13:23.219 --> 13:24.428
Vince doesn't want
to be my friend.

13:24.512 --> 13:26.263
He totally shut me out,
and you know what?

13:26.347 --> 13:27.848
I don't even want
to talk about it anymore.

13:27.932 --> 13:29.767
- So why don't you--
- I'm done. It's over, okay?

13:29.850 --> 13:31.268
I'm totally letting Vince go.

13:31.352 --> 13:33.604
- Yeah, I can see that.
- And who needs him, anyway?

13:33.687 --> 13:36.482
Ben is gonna look like a total
badass without Vince's help.

13:36.565 --> 13:37.733
Okay, so why are you so mad?

13:37.816 --> 13:39.777
Because I went over there
and I didn't think

13:39.860 --> 13:41.612
I was gonna feel anything,
but I felt something, okay?

13:41.695 --> 13:44.865
So can we please drop it?
Ben, get out here!

13:48.827 --> 13:49.870
Look at you!

13:49.954 --> 13:52.373
You totally look like a badass.

13:54.124 --> 13:56.877
Ben, w-why are you giggling?
You're supposed to look tough.

13:56.961 --> 13:59.797
[laughs]
I can't help it.
The leather's tickling my willy.

14:03.759 --> 14:06.595
Oh, my God. He came.

14:06.679 --> 14:09.139
Gary told me about the
extreme makeover they gave you

14:09.223 --> 14:11.267
so I just came by
to see for myself.

14:11.350 --> 14:14.395
[chuckles]
I'm so glad I did.
What are you wearing?

14:14.478 --> 14:17.064
Okay, so that's why you came
all the way down here

14:17.147 --> 14:18.440
just to make fun of us?

14:18.524 --> 14:20.943
Actually, just you.

14:21.026 --> 14:23.946
Well, I'm sorry,
but I only let my friends

14:24.029 --> 14:25.656
make fun of me and you
made it perfectly clear

14:25.739 --> 14:27.866
that you don't want to be
my friend, so you know what?

14:27.950 --> 14:29.034
Ben, don't listen to him.

14:29.118 --> 14:30.619
He doesn't know
what he's talking about.

14:30.703 --> 14:34.582
What's wrong with him, anyway?
He is totally bono.

14:34.665 --> 14:37.626
He looks like
a pinata in a gay bar.

14:37.710 --> 14:41.213
You told me that all cool
Americans dress like this.

14:41.297 --> 14:43.299
Dude, it's not about the look.

14:43.382 --> 14:45.342
Though that one's really bad.

14:45.426 --> 14:47.428
It's all about the attitude.

14:47.511 --> 14:51.348
Right. Right. I know that.

14:51.432 --> 14:52.683
Help me.

14:52.766 --> 14:55.144
I don't think they know
what they're doing.

14:57.396 --> 15:00.858
First of all, you're acting
all desperate, not good.

15:00.941 --> 15:02.985
You gotta seem
totally unavailable to a girl

15:03.068 --> 15:05.321
yet still give her hope
that she has a shot.

15:05.404 --> 15:07.948
[chuckles]
Oh, my God, that's so dumb.

15:13.162 --> 15:14.538
Okay, wh-what are you doing?

15:14.622 --> 15:16.373
Nothing. Why, am I,
making you nervous?

15:16.457 --> 15:17.875
Uh, you wish.

15:17.958 --> 15:19.877
You want her to see you.

15:19.960 --> 15:21.837
Then you got to look at her

15:21.920 --> 15:24.715
as if she's the only one
who can tame you.

15:28.260 --> 15:30.971
And then ignore her.
It drives them crazy.

15:31.055 --> 15:33.098
Okay. You know what?
That is so dumb.

15:33.182 --> 15:35.309
Excuse me, am I talking to you?

15:35.392 --> 15:36.935
And when you know
she's into you, check out

15:37.019 --> 15:38.812
another girl
right in front of her.

15:38.896 --> 15:41.857
Hey, how are you?

15:41.940 --> 15:43.692
Okay, you know what?
You are so immature.

15:43.776 --> 15:46.362
And that girl
was totally looking at me.

15:49.281 --> 15:51.408
And you know you're in when
she starts acting all jealous.

15:51.492 --> 15:53.369
Okay, you know what, Ben?
He's stupid.

15:53.452 --> 15:55.037
Please don't listen to him.

15:55.120 --> 15:57.247
Then when she least expects it.

16:05.964 --> 16:08.092
And that's how you
do it, Fonzie.

16:11.804 --> 16:13.389
Yes, I think I'm gonna go
with Vince's way

16:13.472 --> 16:16.433
because this leather
is really starting to chafe.

16:20.562 --> 16:23.649
[instrumental music]

16:26.860 --> 16:28.696
Well, I finished
cleaning all the mixers.

16:28.779 --> 16:30.072
Oh, great.

16:30.155 --> 16:33.575
Um, listen, Jack, um..

16:33.659 --> 16:37.079
I was thinking, maybe, uh

16:37.162 --> 16:38.372
you and I could go to dinner.

16:38.455 --> 16:40.999
And then take a moonlight stroll
by the river.

16:41.083 --> 16:42.918
You know, like in your novel

16:43.001 --> 16:45.421
except without being attacked
by the bum gangs.

16:47.548 --> 16:49.591
Val, I-I appreciate the offer.

16:49.675 --> 16:52.886
I'm, I'm sorry, but I can't.

16:52.970 --> 16:54.847
In your face!

16:56.640 --> 16:59.143
I thought you were in the alley
emptying the garbage.

16:59.226 --> 17:00.602
Yes, I was, oh, and by the way

17:00.686 --> 17:03.647
some guy named Lenny
wearing a nightgown says hi.

17:03.731 --> 17:05.773
Thanks. Val, I'm sorry.

17:05.858 --> 17:07.401
No, Jack, it's okay.

17:07.483 --> 17:09.236
If you want to go out with
Lauren, that's fine with me.

17:09.319 --> 17:11.113
I can't do that, either.

17:11.195 --> 17:13.323
Ha! Ha ha ha!

17:17.161 --> 17:19.538
What? I mean,
what about the turnstile?

17:19.621 --> 17:22.207
Guys, I'm, I'm going
back to my wife.

17:22.290 --> 17:23.208
(both)
Wife?

17:23.291 --> 17:25.127
Yeah, because of what you did

17:25.210 --> 17:27.421
for me, she took me back.

17:27.503 --> 17:29.089
Wait, you're married?

17:29.173 --> 17:31.550
Ha ha, that is unbelievable!

17:31.633 --> 17:34.011
Homeless woman
gets married before me.

17:35.304 --> 17:36.513
She's not homeless.

17:36.597 --> 17:38.140
No, she'd left me
when I hit rock bottom

17:38.223 --> 17:40.517
but now you've put me
back on the right path.

17:40.601 --> 17:42.811
I've cleaned up,
I've got a great job

17:42.895 --> 17:45.147
and a future,
and I owe it all to you.

17:45.230 --> 17:47.274
Well, you and soap.

17:48.650 --> 17:49.902
See you later.

17:52.154 --> 17:55.157
You know, we just have to
remember we did a good thing--

17:55.240 --> 17:59.328
Oh, yeah, blah, blah, blah.
We got dumped.

17:59.411 --> 18:03.499
Oh, God. I can't believe we were
fighting over a homeless guy.

18:03.582 --> 18:06.001
It can't get
much lower than that.

18:06.085 --> 18:09.505
Hey, I wonder if Lenny is
still wearing that nightgown.

18:09.588 --> 18:11.256
Hey, Lenny!

18:14.968 --> 18:18.055
[instrumental music]

18:20.891 --> 18:22.226
I cannot believe that Ben

18:22.309 --> 18:24.311
is actually going
with Vince's stupid advice.

18:24.394 --> 18:26.021
Well, it worked on you,
after he kissed you

18:26.105 --> 18:29.149
your eyes rolled back in
your head like a slot machine.

18:29.233 --> 18:32.236
Well, I happen
to have an eye problem.

18:35.030 --> 18:38.116
Okay, should I try the stare
on Gary just one more time?

18:38.200 --> 18:40.369
I wish you wouldn't.

18:40.452 --> 18:42.371
Forget that, you're ready.
Now come on! Go!

18:42.454 --> 18:43.539
Okay.

18:49.962 --> 18:52.923
Hoo hoo hoo-hoo! Nice look away.

18:54.132 --> 18:56.969
I'm sorry, Holly.
I just want Ben to get lucky.

19:00.722 --> 19:01.974
[mouthing]

19:03.809 --> 19:07.354
Great. So you taught Ben how
to be a player just like you?

19:07.437 --> 19:08.564
That's nice.

19:08.647 --> 19:10.649
Let me let you in
on a little secret.

19:10.732 --> 19:12.568
You can't get played
if you don't want to be.

19:12.651 --> 19:14.653
- That's insane.
- Oh, it's true.

19:14.736 --> 19:16.905
Like, this afternoon, you
were dying for me to kiss you.

19:16.989 --> 19:19.366
[scoffs]
Oh, my God, you are so--

19:19.449 --> 19:20.826
Irresistible?

19:20.909 --> 19:22.202
Come on, Holly,
look me in the eye

19:22.286 --> 19:23.412
and tell me
you didn't feel something.

19:23.495 --> 19:26.373
I can't. I have an eye problem.

19:26.456 --> 19:27.457
You loved that kiss.

19:27.541 --> 19:29.918
- I so did not.
- You so did.

19:30.002 --> 19:32.379
I hated that kiss.
I wish you never kissed me.

19:32.462 --> 19:33.797
I wish that I could wash it
out of my brain.

19:33.881 --> 19:35.132
So you can't stop
thinking about it.

19:35.215 --> 19:36.884
No! I mean, yes.

19:36.967 --> 19:39.845
I mean, why did you
have to kiss me?

19:39.928 --> 19:41.597
Holly, look at me.

19:42.472 --> 19:43.807
I was doing so great.

19:43.891 --> 19:46.810
The whole hating you
and the not seeing you..

19:46.894 --> 19:50.439
I mean, it was all
pretty much working for me.

19:50.522 --> 19:52.399
Except for the missing you part.

19:52.482 --> 19:53.775
Holly, why are you
fighting so hard?

19:53.859 --> 19:56.486
- Why can't we just try this?
- Because..

19:56.570 --> 19:58.614
I still can't trust you.

19:58.697 --> 20:02.910
I mean, I want to.
I really want to, but..

20:02.993 --> 20:05.078
I'm afraid that..

20:05.162 --> 20:07.247
...if I let myself have
feelings for you again--

20:07.331 --> 20:10.083
Holly, do you trust me
as a friend?

20:10.876 --> 20:12.753
Of course.

20:12.836 --> 20:14.963
Great. We'll start from there.

20:15.047 --> 20:17.049
As friends.

20:17.132 --> 20:18.842
You're willing
to be my friend again?

20:18.926 --> 20:21.219
If that's the only way
you'd trust me then..

20:21.303 --> 20:24.848
Yeah, we'll take it from there,
and see what happens.

20:24.932 --> 20:27.684
So we're friends again?

20:27.768 --> 20:30.062
Like, we can still hang out.

20:30.145 --> 20:31.605
Go to movies.

20:31.688 --> 20:33.482
Have sleepovers?

20:33.565 --> 20:35.275
What?

20:35.359 --> 20:37.486
Well..

20:37.569 --> 20:40.656
