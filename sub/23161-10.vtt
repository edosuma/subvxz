WEBVTT

00:00.050 --> 00:02.143
Higgins, did you wanna
hire me personally?

00:02.219 --> 00:03.982
Yes, but...
I'm gonna need

00:04.054 --> 00:07.114
a little assistance,
that's all.
Sort of a legman.

00:08.292 --> 00:10.920
You are simply to be his
"legman", as he describes it.

00:10.995 --> 00:13.020
The day I'm
Tom Magnum's legman

00:13.097 --> 00:15.531
is the day I sit on a street
corner selling pencils

00:15.599 --> 00:17.533
and drinking cheap pink
out of a paper bag.

00:17.601 --> 00:19.000
I am going inside with you.

00:19.069 --> 00:21.560
You don't know anything
about cowboy joints.

00:21.639 --> 00:23.766
<i>You could get into</i>
<i>serious trouble.</i>

00:24.441 --> 00:27.342
Every time I do
a favor for the big guy,
I end up in this dump.

02:22.193 --> 02:23.387
Payday.

02:23.461 --> 02:26.453
I'm well aware of that.
Why in blazes
do you think I...

02:33.605 --> 02:34.731
Here.

02:35.173 --> 02:37.937
Thank you.
I'll see you next time.

02:38.042 --> 02:40.237
Same place. No cops.

02:41.212 --> 02:42.406
Please...

02:43.915 --> 02:45.075
What?

02:45.950 --> 02:47.611
How much longer?

02:50.822 --> 02:53.086
I asked you
how much longer.

02:58.863 --> 03:01.457
<i>Happiness</i>
<i>is a relative state,</i>

03:01.533 --> 03:06.368
<i>especially as it applies</i>
<i>to the delicate subjects of</i>
<i>work and obligations.</i>

03:06.437 --> 03:10.669
<i>It's a constant turmoil,</i>
<i>and that's where the big</i>
<i>"O" comes in. Obligations.</i>

03:10.742 --> 03:13.575
<i>Like in whether you take</i>
<i>a case because of the money,</i>

03:13.645 --> 03:17.172
<i>because of friendship</i>
<i>and loyalty, or simply</i>
<i>because you have to.</i>

03:19.050 --> 03:21.177
<i>Well, after three weeks</i>
<i>on a tough case</i>

03:21.252 --> 03:23.015
<i>on the North Shore,</i>
<i>all that was irrelevant.</i>

03:23.087 --> 03:24.611
<i>I was happy.</i>

03:24.689 --> 03:28.318
<i>That's because</i>
<i>all my obligations were</i>
<i>part of the past.</i>

03:28.393 --> 03:29.690
<i>Or the distant future.</i>

03:29.761 --> 03:32.025
<i>At any rate,</i>
<i>I wasn't going to</i>
<i>worry about them.</i>

03:32.096 --> 03:35.122
<i>I finally was going</i>
<i>to just rest and kick back.</i>

03:39.637 --> 03:42.504
<i>Hey, Thomas,</i>
<i>where have you been?</i>
<i>I really need your help.</i>

03:42.574 --> 03:46.374
<i>I got a problem</i>
<i>you just wouldn't believe.</i>
<i>Thomas, you got to help me!</i>

03:46.444 --> 03:47.536
What, Rick?

03:48.112 --> 03:50.637
<i>I got a chance to go out</i>
<i>tonight with Belinda Kowalski,</i>

03:50.715 --> 03:53.149
<i>but the catch is</i>
<i>she won't go unless I find</i>
<i>somebody to double</i>

03:53.217 --> 03:54.809
<i>with her roommate, Geraldine.</i>

03:54.886 --> 03:56.820
<i>Please, pal, you got to come.</i>

03:56.888 --> 03:59.379
<i>You got to help me.</i>
<i>I'm in love.</i>

03:59.457 --> 04:01.391
<i>Please.</i>
<i>What do you say?</i>

04:01.693 --> 04:03.422
No.
<i>Thank you.</i>

04:06.130 --> 04:09.896
<i>Hello, Magnum.</i>
<i>I trust you're well.</i>

04:11.002 --> 04:16.303
<i>Good. I need a favor done</i>
<i>of an investigative nature.</i>
<i>I assume you are free?</i>

04:17.007 --> 04:18.065
<i>Good.</i>

04:18.142 --> 04:19.608
<i>A very close friend of mine</i>

04:19.677 --> 04:23.636
<i>owns a majority interest</i>
<i>in Kaimuki Savings and Loan.</i>

04:24.449 --> 04:27.282
<i>Apparently, someone</i>
<i>in the real estate</i>
<i>loan department</i>

04:27.352 --> 04:31.914
<i>has been doing some</i>
<i>long-term embezzling</i>
<i>of the firm's funds.</i>

04:31.990 --> 04:35.153
<i>Consequently, it's been</i>
<i>arranged for you to begin</i>
<i>work there tomorrow,</i>

04:35.226 --> 04:38.252
<i>under the guise</i>
<i>of a loan officer,</i>

04:38.329 --> 04:40.388
<i>to attempt to</i>
<i>ferret out the culprit.</i>

04:40.465 --> 04:43.628
<i>No one in the office will be</i>
<i>aware of your true identity,</i>

04:43.701 --> 04:46.295
<i>since all employees</i>
<i>are suspect.</i>

04:46.371 --> 04:48.271
<i>Please report</i>
<i>to Ms. Cathcart,</i>

04:48.339 --> 04:50.136
<i>the officer manager,</i>
<i>at 8:00 sharp.</i>

04:50.208 --> 04:54.110
<i>She's expecting you.</i>
<i>Further instructions from me</i>
<i>will be on your computer.</i>

04:54.178 --> 04:57.739
<i>Your personal access</i>
<i>code is "Rosebud".</i>

04:57.815 --> 05:00.375
<i>Thank you, Magnum,</i>
<i>and good luck.</i>

05:01.185 --> 05:02.243
Yuck.

05:03.655 --> 05:05.816
<i>Hello, Magnum.</i>
<i>Robin again</i>

05:06.024 --> 05:08.356
<i>with a further reminder.</i>

05:08.793 --> 05:10.727
<i>Please wear a suit and tie.</i>

05:11.095 --> 05:12.824
<i>Polyester, if possible.</i>

05:13.865 --> 05:15.025
<i>Bye now.</i>

05:17.568 --> 05:18.967
Come in.

05:24.475 --> 05:25.567
Higgins.

05:26.344 --> 05:28.278
Yes, you are quite
correct, Magnum.

05:29.247 --> 05:30.441
You knocked?

05:30.515 --> 05:33.245
Of course I knocked.
What civilized
gentleman wouldn't?

05:33.618 --> 05:34.983
You never knock.

05:35.053 --> 05:37.351
You always just
barge right in.

05:37.422 --> 05:40.414
You sick or something?
Feeling okay?

05:40.591 --> 05:42.422
I'm feeling quite fine,
Magnum.

05:42.493 --> 05:45.121
And I'm not here
to discuss my health.

05:45.196 --> 05:48.063
I am here to approach you
about a case.

05:48.132 --> 05:49.724
Oh! I know.

05:51.102 --> 05:52.091
You know?

05:52.170 --> 05:53.228
Of course, I know.

05:53.571 --> 05:55.436
My God.
How could you...

05:55.506 --> 05:57.940
It's all here
on the answering machine.
Robin told me.

05:58.009 --> 06:00.773
And yes, I will clean up
and wear a tie, I promise.

06:00.845 --> 06:03.939
But I draw the line at
wearing a polyester suit.

06:09.053 --> 06:10.816
Mr. Masters hired you
on a case?

06:10.888 --> 06:12.788
Yeah. That's right.
Kaimuki Savings and Loan.

06:12.857 --> 06:16.520
Oh, I think Robin didn't want
to wait for you to tell me.

06:16.761 --> 06:19.662
I know I've been gone
a lot... Higgins?

06:24.135 --> 06:26.831
Higgins, did you wanna
hire me personally?

06:28.272 --> 06:29.967
Yes, but...

06:30.141 --> 06:33.406
It's relatively unimportant,
and in as much as
you are already disposed,

06:33.478 --> 06:35.412
I'm sure I can make
other arrangements.

06:35.480 --> 06:38.005
After all, I'm sure
it's something that

06:38.082 --> 06:40.414
any semi-competent
detective could do.

06:40.485 --> 06:41.577
Forget I brought
it up, Magnum.

06:41.686 --> 06:42.675
Wait, wait, wait, Higgins.

06:44.856 --> 06:48.383
You've never wanted
to hire me, I mean...

06:50.094 --> 06:53.029
I guess you've come to
appreciate me for
the professional that I am.

06:53.097 --> 06:54.462
I'm gonna help you, pal.

06:58.369 --> 06:59.768
Well...

07:01.439 --> 07:03.134
All right then. Thank you.

07:03.207 --> 07:05.971
However, even though,
as I've said,

07:07.044 --> 07:09.569
the case itself is
relatively unimportant...

07:09.647 --> 07:11.114
Wait. Wait.

07:12.950 --> 07:15.942
This isn't something
stupid, is it?

07:16.020 --> 07:18.580
Like the trisected
Paulo worm or the kudu buck?

07:18.656 --> 07:20.317
Nevertheless,

07:21.058 --> 07:22.958
you should be cautioned
that the matter requires

07:23.027 --> 07:24.961
the greatest
discretion and tact,

07:25.329 --> 07:28.696
qualities which in the past
you have been sorely lacking.

07:29.333 --> 07:33.292
However, at the moment I have
no other recourse, so...

07:34.639 --> 07:38.405
My situation began
some 30 years ago...

07:40.011 --> 07:42.775
Higgins, before you go on,

07:42.847 --> 07:46.339
I think there is something
that I should tell you.

07:46.684 --> 07:47.708
What?

07:48.419 --> 07:52.617
Well, because of
my other commitment to Robin,

07:54.058 --> 07:57.926
I can only handle
this case in a sort of
supervisorial fashion.

07:58.763 --> 08:01.732
What is it you are
attempting to say, Magnum?
If you're not going to...

08:01.799 --> 08:04.529
No, I am, I am.
I'll be right on top of it.

08:04.602 --> 08:08.436
It's just that
because of this other
Savings and Loan thing,

08:08.506 --> 08:10.838
I'm gonna need
a little assistance,
that's all.

08:10.908 --> 08:12.603
Sort of a legman.

08:12.677 --> 08:15.305
If you're contemplating
using Rick or T. C...

08:15.379 --> 08:16.778
No, no, no, not Rick or T.C.

08:16.848 --> 08:18.213
Then who?

08:19.851 --> 08:23.412
Well, it's someone
with a real private
investigator's license.

08:23.487 --> 08:24.613
Who?

08:25.022 --> 08:28.423
Someone with a great deal
of discretion and tact.

08:28.659 --> 08:29.887
Who?

08:29.961 --> 08:31.895
Someone who'll be just right.

08:31.963 --> 08:33.054
Who?

08:33.130 --> 08:35.724
Does the phrase,
"Stuff it, Scrungo"
ring a bell?

08:38.501 --> 08:40.059
Oh, my God.

08:52.116 --> 08:56.177
<i>Hiya, kiddos.</i>
<i>Name's Gillis, Luther.</i>
<i>You remember me.</i>

08:56.254 --> 08:59.382
<i>I'm the big-time,</i>
<i>big-city gumshoe</i>
<i>from Saint Louis.</i>

08:59.457 --> 09:01.857
<i>The one that keeps</i>
<i>having to come out</i>
<i>to the Big Pineapple</i>

09:01.926 --> 09:04.656
<i>to save the neck</i>
<i>of my brother P.I.,</i>
<i>Tom Magnum.</i>

09:04.962 --> 09:07.260
<i>Anyway, I was getting</i>
<i>so good at it,</i>

09:07.331 --> 09:09.162
<i>I guess he kind of</i>
<i>felt obligated,</i>

09:09.233 --> 09:12.031
<i>especially when I told him</i>
<i>that my secretary, Blanche,</i>

09:12.103 --> 09:13.968
<i>quit waiting for me</i>
<i>to tie the knot</i>

09:14.038 --> 09:16.598
<i>and ran off with this</i>
<i>encyclopedia salesman guy.</i>

09:17.108 --> 09:19.474
<i>I had to close the office</i>
<i>and everything.</i>

09:19.577 --> 09:22.068
<i>But who cares?</i>
<i>Her loss.</i>

09:22.880 --> 09:26.338
<i>I could tell that the big guy</i>
<i>felt awful about it, too,</i>

09:26.417 --> 09:28.510
<i>'cause even though</i>
<i>he wouldn't let me</i>
<i>stay with him,</i>

09:28.586 --> 09:30.747
<i>'cause they're remodeling</i>
<i>the mansion or something,</i>

09:30.821 --> 09:35.281
<i>he did promise me and cross</i>
<i>his heart that he'd swing</i>
<i>the next extra case my way.</i>

09:36.460 --> 09:40.726
<i>Even gave me a line</i>
<i>on this neat office.</i>
<i>What a prince.</i>

09:40.865 --> 09:42.924
<i>And he even came</i>
<i>through with the case.</i>

09:43.000 --> 09:46.060
<i>Holy cow, I expected</i>
<i>some action.</i>
<i>But this fast?</i>

09:46.137 --> 09:49.004
<i>Hey, my pal</i>
<i>Tom Magnum delivers,</i>

09:49.473 --> 09:51.964
<i>even if it was</i>
<i>just the butler cat.</i>

09:52.043 --> 09:53.601
<i>But a case is a case.</i>

09:53.711 --> 09:56.612
<i>I think I'll call</i>
<i>this one File 001.</i>

09:56.681 --> 09:59.445
<i>My maiden voyage here</i>
<i>in Banana Land.</i>

10:01.352 --> 10:04.014
Hey, you're right on time.

10:04.088 --> 10:05.988
Which is more than
can be said for you.

10:06.057 --> 10:08.685
Additionally, how dare
you leave the phone number
of the estate

10:08.759 --> 10:11.353
on your office door
where anyone off
the street can copy it?

10:11.429 --> 10:12.418
How dare you?

10:12.496 --> 10:14.054
Gee, I'm sorry.
I didn't think you'd mind.

10:14.131 --> 10:16.099
Mind? Mind?

10:16.300 --> 10:19.895
Mr. Masters' private line.
The red phone.
Why would I mind?

10:19.971 --> 10:22.030
How in bloody hell
did you get it?

10:22.106 --> 10:24.336
I probably jotted it down
the last time I was by.

10:24.408 --> 10:27.070
I only did it
because I didn't have time
to go to the phone company

10:27.144 --> 10:28.304
and have one put in yet.

10:28.379 --> 10:30.540
Hey, big deal.
It'll only be
for a few days.

10:30.614 --> 10:32.878
Hardly. I'll have it
changed immediately.

10:32.950 --> 10:34.645
Now, may we proceed?

10:34.719 --> 10:35.777
Certainly.

10:35.853 --> 10:37.286
You were doing
a pretty good job

10:37.355 --> 10:39.550
of explaining it on the phone
till I ran out of dimes.

10:39.623 --> 10:41.648
Now, there's only one thing
I don't understand.

10:41.726 --> 10:42.852
Just one?

10:42.927 --> 10:44.554
Hey, do you want me
to handle this or not?

10:44.628 --> 10:46.858
You're not handling it.
Magnum is.

10:46.931 --> 10:49.593
You are simply to be his
"legman", as he describes it.

10:49.667 --> 10:52.727
Yeah, yeah. The day
I'm Tom Magnum's legman

10:52.803 --> 10:55.169
is the day I sit on a street
corner selling pencils

10:55.239 --> 10:58.106
and drinking cheap pink
out of a paper bag.
Now, let's get on with it.

10:58.175 --> 11:01.770
Gladly. Now, what is it
that you do not understand?

11:02.313 --> 11:05.510
Now, why didn't you tell
the lady in England
she was being blackmailed?

11:05.583 --> 11:08.518
Perhaps the concept of honor
is an alien one to you,

11:08.586 --> 11:10.417
as is the one, "gentleman".
Hey...

11:10.488 --> 11:12.353
Nevertheless,
under no circumstances

11:12.423 --> 11:15.324
should Elizabeth Andrews be
made aware of the situation.

11:15.393 --> 11:17.384
She is a member of
the House of Commons,

11:17.461 --> 11:20.521
and her career would be
in ruins if there were
the slightest inkling

11:20.598 --> 11:22.759
that she had had
an illegitimate son.

11:22.833 --> 11:24.926
As a matter of fact,
Elizabeth...

11:25.202 --> 11:28.137
Mrs. Andrews
is frequently mentioned
as a potential candidate

11:28.205 --> 11:29.866
for prime minister
from her party.

11:29.940 --> 11:32.204
Oh, yeah?
I'm real impressed.

11:32.543 --> 11:34.943
Except how could she be
the mother of a country

11:35.012 --> 11:37.276
when she can't be
the mother of her kid?

11:37.615 --> 11:39.105
Unless it ain't her kid.

11:39.683 --> 11:41.116
I beg your pardon?

11:41.185 --> 11:42.618
What I'm saying is,

11:43.521 --> 11:45.682
what if this Eric
fellow ain't hers?

11:46.857 --> 11:48.654
If only that were so.

11:48.893 --> 11:52.090
But the blackmailers
have presented me with
empirical evidence.

11:52.163 --> 11:56.031
Birth certificates,
medical and school records,
adoption papers.

11:56.367 --> 11:58.198
The child is undoubtedly hers.

11:58.269 --> 12:01.204
How come they came
to you in Hawaii
instead of her in England?

12:02.339 --> 12:04.739
Well, obviously...
Obviously, it's somebody
who you bought.

12:04.809 --> 12:06.208
Someone out of your past.

12:06.277 --> 12:09.110
The only person I've had
any contact with is the...

12:09.180 --> 12:10.408
Go on, say it.

12:10.481 --> 12:13.609
Bagman. Let me tell you
something, Hig.

12:13.884 --> 12:16.148
Blackmail's an ugly business.
You got to get used to it.

12:16.220 --> 12:17.710
I did.

12:17.788 --> 12:19.756
Now let me get
some more facts.

12:19.824 --> 12:21.348
How old is the little nipper?

12:21.425 --> 12:22.551
Thirty.

12:22.626 --> 12:24.287
Months?
Years.

12:25.029 --> 12:29.966
The assignation
in question took place
in Mrs. Andrews' youth,

12:30.334 --> 12:32.700
when she was a young woman
growing up in Kenya.

12:33.537 --> 12:36.267
It must have been
awfully Ionely out there
on the veldt.

12:36.340 --> 12:37.534
Hey,

12:38.843 --> 12:41.243
you mess around,
you got to pay the piper.

12:41.445 --> 12:42.844
I know, believe me.

12:43.247 --> 12:44.771
I'm sure you do.

12:45.082 --> 12:46.481
Damn right.

12:47.151 --> 12:49.278
Look, your lady friend's
in trouble,
we're gonna help her.

12:49.353 --> 12:52.379
But don't try to convince me
she's some kind of saint.

12:53.557 --> 12:56.355
She's a broad.
All the same.

12:59.763 --> 13:01.993
So are kidnappers
and extortionists.

13:02.066 --> 13:04.261
None of them like
to be kept waiting.

13:04.835 --> 13:06.530
So let's go.

13:08.239 --> 13:10.434
They're all the same.

13:15.112 --> 13:17.546
So are private investigators.

13:23.921 --> 13:26.822
<i>Pull over.</i>
<i>I think I'm gonna</i>
<i>toss my cookies.</i>

13:26.891 --> 13:28.449
T. C: <i>Pull over where?</i>

13:28.526 --> 13:30.255
<i>Anywhere,</i>
<i>but do it fast.</i>

13:30.327 --> 13:32.420
T. C: <i>Oh, no.</i>

13:42.773 --> 13:44.001
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

13:44.341 --> 13:45.399
T. C: <i>Sorry?</i>

13:45.476 --> 13:48.968
<i>It's bad enough that I let</i>
<i>Magnum con me into flying you</i>
<i>all over the place,</i>

13:49.046 --> 13:51.344
<i>but now I got to...</i>
- <i>Please, shut up.</i>

13:51.415 --> 13:52.905
<i>Here comes</i>
<i>the Mongolian beef.</i>

13:52.983 --> 13:54.416
T. C: <i>Okay, okay, okay, okay.</i>

13:58.022 --> 13:59.956
<i>At least there are</i>
<i>no bullet holes.</i>

14:01.225 --> 14:02.817
<i>All right, we're here.</i>

14:32.256 --> 14:35.851
<i>Hey, you know,</i>
<i>this is kind of neat</i>
<i>once you get used to it.</i>

14:36.160 --> 14:38.856
<i>I never pulled a tail</i>
<i>in an aeroplane before.</i>

14:38.929 --> 14:40.021
<i>Chopper.</i>

14:50.207 --> 14:52.937
<i>You know, it's kind of nice</i>
<i>when get used to it.</i>

14:53.010 --> 14:54.170
<i>It kind of reminds me of...</i>

14:57.781 --> 15:00.648
Don't look at me.
I'm just Tom Magnum's legman.

15:09.390 --> 15:11.537
<i>Okay, I know</i>
<i>what you're thinking.</i>

15:11.611 --> 15:13.772
<i>Maybe I shouldn't have</i>
<i>given the case to Luther.</i>

15:13.847 --> 15:16.281
<i>Maybe this was something</i>
<i>really serious.</i>

15:16.349 --> 15:19.011
<i>But on the other hand,</i>
<i>I kind of doubted it.</i>

15:19.086 --> 15:20.986
<i>Because on closer examination,</i>

15:21.054 --> 15:24.285
<i>even T.C. Had to admit</i>
<i>that the bullet did not come</i>
<i>from the car</i>

15:24.357 --> 15:27.326
<i>he and Luther were tailing.</i>
<i>It came from behind them.</i>

15:27.494 --> 15:29.394
<i>Probably pakalolo growers.</i>

15:30.030 --> 15:32.726
<i>Therefore, I didn't</i>
<i>have any qualms about</i>
<i>Luther continuing</i>

15:32.799 --> 15:34.892
<i>with whatever Higgins'</i>
<i>little problem was.</i>

15:34.968 --> 15:37.129
<i>Especially since I was</i>
<i>going to be really tied up</i>

15:37.204 --> 15:39.764
<i>with this important</i>
<i>embezzlement case for Robin.</i>

15:39.840 --> 15:43.640
<i>I figured as long as I was</i>
<i>telling Luther what to do,</i>
<i>he'd be okay.</i>

15:43.977 --> 15:46.537
<i>Kind of like following</i>
<i>in my footsteps.</i>

15:46.646 --> 15:47.635
<i>Put it on my tab.</i>

15:47.714 --> 15:49.011
You don't have a tab.

15:49.082 --> 15:50.572
Who cares?
The big guy does.

15:50.650 --> 15:52.277
Find anything out
yet from Ice Man?

15:52.352 --> 15:53.546
It's Ice Pick.

15:53.620 --> 15:55.679
What's the difference?
The guy's a bum.

15:55.756 --> 15:59.351
I'm kind of inclined to
sneak into his steam bath
and snap his towel.

15:59.426 --> 16:00.415
You know what I mean?

16:00.494 --> 16:01.586
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

16:01.661 --> 16:02.719
Oh, yeah?

16:03.864 --> 16:04.990
Hi, Hig, what's shaking?

16:05.065 --> 16:07.625
Absolutely nothing,
except for the fact that
you're off the case.

16:07.701 --> 16:09.396
Hello?
You and Magnum.

16:09.469 --> 16:11.562
I should have known
the situation was too delicate

16:11.638 --> 16:14.163
to entrust to a detective
who sublets.

16:14.241 --> 16:15.606
I will endeavor now...

16:15.675 --> 16:17.142
Hey, hey, what are you
talking about?

16:17.210 --> 16:18.541
We're just getting
started here.

16:18.612 --> 16:20.603
Fortunately, you won't
be around to finish.

16:20.680 --> 16:23.649
I'll send Magnum a check.
He can divide it with you
anyway he likes.

16:23.717 --> 16:25.844
No. They can
divide it with me.

16:26.219 --> 16:28.551
$833.97.

16:28.622 --> 16:30.681
That's how much
a new plate
is gonna cost you.

16:30.757 --> 16:32.384
Put it on
the big guy's tab.

16:33.994 --> 16:35.723
His tab is history.
Quite.

16:35.796 --> 16:37.696
Let me tell
you guys something.

16:37.764 --> 16:40.995
Nobody takes a shot at
Luther Gillis or his pals

16:41.067 --> 16:43.035
and gets away with it.
Nobody.

16:43.103 --> 16:44.593
That ain't a part of life.

16:45.772 --> 16:48.605
That's why I'm gonna
find the crud who shot
your aeroplane

16:48.675 --> 16:50.700
and the crud who's
blackmailing your lady friend

16:50.777 --> 16:53.211
if I have to go
to the end of the earth
or I can't crawl anymore.

16:53.280 --> 16:56.044
Luther H. Gillis
finishes what he starts.

16:59.452 --> 17:01.147
All I need is a clue.

17:01.922 --> 17:05.824
Cal's Country Bar
and Billiard Den.
West Kilauea Street.

17:06.092 --> 17:08.026
That's where the guy
hangs out.

17:10.564 --> 17:13.396
<i>There's an old saying.</i>
<i>I think it was by me,</i>

17:13.465 --> 17:16.435
<i>that a private eye is only</i>
<i>as good as the kind of clues</i>

17:16.502 --> 17:18.800
<i>and the kind of clients</i>
<i>he's got to work with.</i>

17:18.872 --> 17:22.069
<i>On this case, I figured</i>
<i>it was about 50-50.</i>

17:22.375 --> 17:25.138
<i>Pretty good clue,</i>
<i>so-so client.</i>

17:32.319 --> 17:34.514
Now, you wait here.
I'll be right back.

17:34.588 --> 17:36.681
I'm not waiting anywhere.
I am going inside with you.

17:36.756 --> 17:38.087
You can't go inside.

17:38.158 --> 17:41.286
I should've never let you
talk me into coming along
in the first place, but I...

17:41.361 --> 17:44.558
But you are indeed
lucky to still be employed,
Mr. Gillis. Furthermore...

17:44.631 --> 17:47.600
Furthermore, you don't know
anything about cowboy joints.

17:47.667 --> 17:49.430
You could get into
serious trouble.

17:49.502 --> 17:52.767
Nonsense.
I'm quite conversant with
the ways of the West.

17:52.839 --> 17:54.329
How? How?

17:54.407 --> 17:57.672
Did you grow up on
Tom Mix and Hopalong Cassidy
at the Bijou?

17:57.744 --> 17:59.405
Did you? Did you?

17:59.579 --> 18:01.672
I know just how to
talk to these guys.

18:01.748 --> 18:03.375
They'll tell me
where Warren is.

18:03.450 --> 18:05.850
They certainly ain't
gonna tell any old limey.

18:06.887 --> 18:09.947
Who you calling a limey, boy?

18:10.790 --> 18:12.587
Where'd you learn
to talk like that?

18:13.059 --> 18:15.527
Let's just say
it's a family trait.

18:31.478 --> 18:32.672
Brew.

18:34.514 --> 18:35.776
Two.

19:03.310 --> 19:04.641
Howdy, partners.

19:12.018 --> 19:16.216
Name's Elmo Ziller.
I poke from Hondo, Texas.

19:16.289 --> 19:18.814
This here's
my partner, Hubert.

19:21.895 --> 19:24.557
How about a friendly game
to pass the time?

19:26.566 --> 19:28.124
I ain't got no quarter.

19:28.802 --> 19:30.565
You got any quarters, Artie?

19:30.904 --> 19:31.996
Nope.

19:32.072 --> 19:33.630
Sure don't, Dexter.

19:34.240 --> 19:38.609
I ain't had no quarters since
last Thursday when that feller
and his monkey come through.

19:38.678 --> 19:40.839
Yeah. Sucker sure could dance.

19:41.715 --> 19:43.842
We're out of quarters
till payday.

19:44.250 --> 19:45.615
When's payday?

19:45.852 --> 19:47.012
Never.

19:47.087 --> 19:50.750
We was just fired off
from the <i>Double-D</i>
over the Ewa way.

19:51.224 --> 19:52.521
<i>Double-D?</i>

19:52.592 --> 19:55.186
Never heard of it.
What'd you raise,
stock or ponies?

19:55.261 --> 19:56.455
Fish.

19:58.198 --> 19:59.961
It's a tuna fish boat.

20:05.238 --> 20:08.139
Now, how about that game?

20:10.377 --> 20:12.072
You got it, son.

20:16.449 --> 20:18.144
Rack them up, Hubert.

20:18.218 --> 20:19.480
Right.

20:23.189 --> 20:26.124
What you all know
about a good old boy,
name of Warren?

20:30.764 --> 20:32.493
Break them, stranger.

20:42.175 --> 20:45.736
Say, why don't we
make this interesting?

20:46.913 --> 20:49.313
Like 20 bucks'
worth of interesting?

21:01.728 --> 21:04.026
Eight ball
in the side pocket.

21:12.305 --> 21:13.670
That's the way to do it.

21:15.141 --> 21:17.234
That's real nice shooting.

21:17.477 --> 21:19.570
Just lucky, I guess.
Yeah.

21:20.814 --> 21:22.577
You know, Elmo and I
ought to be getting

21:22.649 --> 21:25.777
before we plumb
run out of the money
we owe poor old Warren.

21:27.320 --> 21:28.912
You got a point, Hubert.

21:29.789 --> 21:32.019
These boys here
are just too good.

21:33.927 --> 21:35.827
Where'd you say
Warren was?

21:36.496 --> 21:37.622
Didn't.

21:38.465 --> 21:41.798
But you might could find him
around the <i>Double-D</i>
about midnight.

21:42.735 --> 21:44.225
Fishing at midnight?

21:44.938 --> 21:46.872
He's the dock watchman.

21:48.441 --> 21:51.137
Great. Well, thanks, boys.

21:51.478 --> 21:53.844
Elmo and I ought to be
moseying along.

21:53.913 --> 21:55.813
Wait a sec, Hubert.

21:56.816 --> 21:58.977
How about
one more game, Dex?

21:59.352 --> 22:03.049
Just give me one last chance
to get some of my money back.

22:04.691 --> 22:07.353
Sure. I think
that's only fair.

22:08.061 --> 22:09.187
How much?

22:09.429 --> 22:10.555
$500.

22:19.739 --> 22:21.229
Rack them up, Hubert.

22:55.675 --> 22:57.768
Eight ball in the corner.

23:01.714 --> 23:03.375
Hey!
- What?

23:05.852 --> 23:07.945
Oh, my God.
- Get off the table.

23:08.621 --> 23:10.987
Say, they don't talk
like that in Hondo.

23:11.057 --> 23:12.354
Nobody trips Luther Gillis!

23:14.060 --> 23:15.755
Come on, Hig,
let's get out of here.

23:18.865 --> 23:21.629
Hey, help us!
Get them!

23:28.374 --> 23:29.534
Hurry!

23:30.577 --> 23:32.841
Hurry! My God, man,
they're going to...

23:32.912 --> 23:35.540
I can't.
I left the keys in the bar.

23:36.916 --> 23:40.579
Let me see
what I can do about
these applications.

23:41.187 --> 23:43.212
Everything seems
to be in order.

23:50.129 --> 23:52.996
Mr. Magnum, please.

23:53.166 --> 23:55.532
I'm sorry. Sorry.

23:55.969 --> 23:58.870
That's Mrs. Cathcart.
She is the office manager.

23:58.938 --> 24:01.406
I have to pretend
you need a loan

24:01.908 --> 24:03.535
for your medical bills.

24:05.078 --> 24:07.876
Listen, big guy,
you're getting half
the retainer on this one

24:07.947 --> 24:09.574
and we're taking
all the lumps.

24:09.649 --> 24:12.948
That's because
I am the supervising
investigator.

24:13.019 --> 24:15.647
Be that as it may, Magnum,
we've come up with a lead.

24:15.722 --> 24:18.247
The known whereabouts
of the man I've been
dealing with.

24:18.324 --> 24:20.258
Now, I suggest we go
speak with him.

24:20.326 --> 24:23.591
Yeah, tonight,
when he's on duty down
at the <i>Double-D</i> docks.

24:23.696 --> 24:25.391
We'll go down
and stuff his gills.

24:26.699 --> 24:29.429
We can't go down
and stuff his gills.

24:30.003 --> 24:31.493
Why not? You chicken?

24:32.972 --> 24:34.234
Not really, Luther.

24:34.307 --> 24:38.437
It just appears that
this case is neither
fish nor fowl.

24:40.280 --> 24:42.908
I refuse to sit here
any longer
and subject myself

24:42.982 --> 24:45.007
to this childishly
inane behavior.
Furthermore...

24:45.084 --> 24:46.517
Sit down.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

24:46.586 --> 24:48.520
I'm just a little dingy.

24:48.655 --> 24:52.182
I've been working on
this very important case
for Robin all day

24:52.258 --> 24:53.953
and tomorrow
I will get to

24:54.027 --> 24:56.325
your "relatively unimportant"
case. Your words.

24:57.063 --> 24:58.360
I'm sorry.

24:59.532 --> 25:01.295
I'm sorry. Please sit down.

25:01.934 --> 25:03.094
Please.

25:08.908 --> 25:10.933
Now, we can't
go down to the docks

25:11.010 --> 25:13.501
because I have to work on
the bank computer all night.

25:13.579 --> 25:16.742
I mean, there's
a time clock running on
this embezzling thing,

25:16.816 --> 25:18.784
and if you can
give me till tomorrow,

25:18.851 --> 25:21.319
then I'll go down and see
this Warren guy myself.

25:21.387 --> 25:22.513
How?

25:22.588 --> 25:24.021
He'll be off work by then.

25:24.324 --> 25:26.053
I'll get his address
out of the computer.

25:26.125 --> 25:27.649
He's got to have
a bank account somewhere.

25:27.727 --> 25:29.160
Come on, you guys
did the legwork.

25:29.228 --> 25:31.526
Leave the sophisticated
part of the case to me.

25:36.202 --> 25:37.533
Very well.

25:39.539 --> 25:41.769
Okay. You guys go home,
get some rest

25:41.841 --> 25:43.103
and we'll touch base
tomorrow.

25:43.476 --> 25:46.968
And don't forget
those pesky little
IRS statements.

25:52.285 --> 25:54.310
I'll drop you off
at your office.

25:54.387 --> 25:56.514
Yeah. Thanks.
Where you going?

25:56.589 --> 25:58.113
The estate.

25:58.191 --> 25:59.351
You're lying.

25:59.792 --> 26:00.816
I beg your pardon?

26:00.893 --> 26:02.019
You're lying.

26:02.095 --> 26:04.188
You're thinking about
heading down to the dock.

26:04.263 --> 26:08.097
You're thinking that Magnum's
not gonna do anything but play
with his computer all night.

26:08.167 --> 26:11.534
And that ain't doing
your common lady friend
a damn bit of good.

26:11.604 --> 26:14.698
It would be unfair to ask you
to take that risk.

26:15.241 --> 26:16.765
Big deal. Who cares?

26:16.943 --> 26:18.808
I was born taking risks.

26:19.746 --> 26:22.180
Besides, I'm kind of
thinking about a lady, too.

26:22.882 --> 26:24.144
Blanche?

26:26.319 --> 26:28.048
Your daughter Nancy?

26:29.789 --> 26:31.256
Your first wife?

26:31.324 --> 26:32.791
All of them.
Let's go.

26:38.231 --> 26:39.994
Boy,
this place stinks.

26:40.066 --> 26:41.260
Kind of reminds me...

26:41.334 --> 26:43.165
Here we are.

26:46.606 --> 26:47.868
Where is he?

26:48.808 --> 26:50.298
Don't worry, Zorba.

26:50.810 --> 26:53.040
I'll make him come to us.
How?

26:53.112 --> 26:57.378
<i>Fifteen men on</i>
<i>a dead man's chest, yo ho ho</i>

26:57.450 --> 26:59.441
<i>And a bottle of rum...</i>
My God.

26:59.519 --> 27:02.454
<i>Anchors aweigh my boys...</i>

27:02.522 --> 27:04.080
What are you doing?

27:04.891 --> 27:06.654
I'm trying to find Warren.

27:13.800 --> 27:15.358
I think you just did.

27:23.543 --> 27:25.534
<i>Freeze.</i>
<i>You're under arrest!</i>

27:32.318 --> 27:35.685
I want out of this hole now!

27:35.754 --> 27:39.019
Look, I've been
in much worse,
I can assure you.

27:39.725 --> 27:43.422
Calcutta, '49, and '50.

27:43.796 --> 27:45.127
Who cares?

27:45.564 --> 27:48.795
Every time I do
a favor for the big guy
I end up in this dump.

27:48.867 --> 27:49.993
I hate it.

27:51.003 --> 27:53.028
It's like going home
for Christmas.

27:53.105 --> 27:55.266
The only difference is,
neither the big guy

27:55.341 --> 27:57.536
nor the suicidal bum,
Scrungo, is here.

27:57.609 --> 27:59.406
Instead, I'm stuck with you.

27:59.778 --> 28:02.338
I'm disgusted.
The feeling is mutual,
I assure you.

28:02.414 --> 28:03.881
Yeah, well, that goes
double for me.

28:03.949 --> 28:06.179
I should've never taken you
with me in the first place.

28:06.251 --> 28:07.775
That was mistake number one.

28:07.853 --> 28:09.343
The first of many.

28:09.421 --> 28:10.581
Oh, yeah?

28:11.357 --> 28:12.619
Yeah.

28:12.992 --> 28:17.258
Obviously, your primitively
crude surveillance techniques
forced the blackmailers to,

28:17.329 --> 28:19.263
one, take a shot at you
in the helicopter

28:19.331 --> 28:21.265
to try to dissuade you
from tailing Warren,

28:21.333 --> 28:23.062
and two, that failing,

28:23.135 --> 28:25.535
they had no choice
but to kill him
when you loudly announced

28:25.604 --> 28:27.469
your intentions
in the cowboy bar.

28:27.539 --> 28:29.939
Don't you loudly
intentions me, buster!

28:30.242 --> 28:33.211
I didn't make the run
on that table and make
those guys crazy.

28:33.278 --> 28:35.542
I was willing to leave
with the info.

28:35.781 --> 28:37.180
Neat and clean.

28:37.683 --> 28:39.048
Now look where we are.

28:39.118 --> 28:42.986
Incarcerated.
"Discretion and tact".

28:43.055 --> 28:44.579
Hogwash.

28:44.957 --> 28:46.447
Speaking of hogwash,

28:46.658 --> 28:48.558
did you get ahold
of your shyster yet?

28:50.095 --> 28:52.529
They're trying to track him
down at the Polo Club.

28:52.598 --> 28:55.897
The Polo Club?
Well, hoity-toity-toity.

28:56.068 --> 28:57.968
What do we do till then, rot?

28:59.071 --> 29:02.598
<i>I was hoping</i>
<i>I would never have to see you</i>
<i>ever again, Mr. Gillis.</i>

29:02.674 --> 29:03.834
Likewise.

29:04.676 --> 29:08.305
I must have been
a pretty bad person
in my previous life.

29:08.781 --> 29:10.908
You couldn't be worse
than a copper.

29:10.983 --> 29:12.610
Or a private eye.

29:12.985 --> 29:15.283
Nevertheless, I have my duty.

29:16.588 --> 29:18.283
You're new at this, Hig.

29:18.357 --> 29:22.123
This is where he threatens us
with a murder rap unless
we answer some questions.

29:22.194 --> 29:24.355
Yeah. Questions like,

29:24.630 --> 29:27.190
what was your relationship
to the deceased?

29:28.534 --> 29:30.968
I've never seen
the gentleman before
in my life.

29:31.036 --> 29:33.470
Then what were you doing
down at the waterfront?

29:35.707 --> 29:37.504
It was late
and we were hungry.

29:39.878 --> 29:41.743
Him I could expect this from.

29:42.247 --> 29:45.910
But you, you,
Jonathan Higgins? Never.

29:45.984 --> 29:48.384
There's always a first time,
Lieutenant.

29:49.321 --> 29:51.312
I want answers.

29:51.390 --> 29:52.914
What about Warren Brummer?

29:52.991 --> 29:54.652
I think he was
working for scale.

29:57.729 --> 29:59.526
I'm warning you both.

30:00.599 --> 30:03.033
Maybe I can't make
a murder charge stick,

30:03.268 --> 30:05.702
but I can yank
your license, Gillis.

30:06.538 --> 30:10.269
As for you, Higgins,
I can call the newspapers

30:10.342 --> 30:14.369
and make your life
awfully miserable
and awfully public.

30:14.746 --> 30:17.579
Who cares?
Why don't you go dust
the fish for some prints?

30:17.649 --> 30:20.777
Meanwhile, if you're not
gonna press charges, aloha.

30:23.722 --> 30:25.053
Ditto.

30:27.126 --> 30:28.457
Here's where he says...

30:28.527 --> 30:30.461
Don't leave town!

30:35.601 --> 30:38.399
I told you to wait for me.
I told you!

30:40.772 --> 30:42.399
But no, you had to
force things.

30:42.474 --> 30:45.204
Big deal. The crud's dead.
We need a new lead.

30:45.277 --> 30:46.437
Now you do.

30:46.512 --> 30:49.675
Now all this information
I pulled out on
Warren Brummer is irrelevant.

30:49.748 --> 30:51.841
How'd you get this stuff?
This is a bank.

30:52.551 --> 30:55.349
I have a friend
in the prosecuting
attorney's office.

30:55.420 --> 30:57.888
Carol let our computers
talk to each other.

30:57.956 --> 31:00.948
Bank robbery,
extortion, bigamy.

31:01.026 --> 31:02.323
Gee, that's too bad.

31:02.661 --> 31:04.526
Who's gonna let all
his wives know he's dead?

31:04.596 --> 31:05.927
What now?

31:06.698 --> 31:11.067
Well, my guess is Brummer
was killed because you two
got too close to him.

31:11.136 --> 31:12.763
And whoever
the blackmailers are,

31:12.838 --> 31:15.170
they just didn't want
to get rousted just yet.

31:15.240 --> 31:16.673
What a genius.

31:18.277 --> 31:21.246
They'll probably
wait a little while
and contact you.

31:22.214 --> 31:24.239
Start all over again.

31:26.818 --> 31:28.115
Why didn't you wait?

31:28.187 --> 31:29.620
It ain't my nature.

31:30.589 --> 31:33.023
Besides, the butler didn't
want to wait either.

31:35.127 --> 31:39.530
Well, at least you're not
up on misdemeanor trespassing
charges. Tanaka called.

31:39.598 --> 31:42.897
The owner of the <i>Double-D,</i>
Dan Davies, he's not going
to press charges.

31:42.968 --> 31:44.663
He's willing to forget
the whole thing.

31:44.736 --> 31:46.328
My lucky day.

31:46.638 --> 31:47.662
Hey.

31:47.739 --> 31:49.969
It's quite all right.
I just lost my footing.
I'm okay.

31:54.947 --> 31:57.211
You better get him
back to the estate.

31:58.217 --> 32:00.048
Maybe you could
do me a favor.

32:00.118 --> 32:01.415
I'm way ahead of you.

32:01.486 --> 32:03.454
I'll stay with him
till you get back.

32:04.289 --> 32:05.517
Thanks.

32:05.591 --> 32:09.357
It'll be in the morning.
I've got to stay up all night
with the computer again.

32:10.929 --> 32:12.123
Yeah.

32:12.564 --> 32:14.589
Don't do anything
I wouldn't do.

32:44.296 --> 32:47.129
<i>So much for</i>
<i>sweet dreams in paradise.</i>

32:47.366 --> 32:50.426
<i>I guess I'm used to either</i>
<i>freezing Saint Louis winters</i>

32:50.569 --> 32:54.027
<i>or summer nights</i>
<i>that could steam the starch</i>
<i>out of your shorts.</i>

33:07.753 --> 33:10.085
<i>At any rate, I couldn't sleep.</i>

33:10.455 --> 33:12.616
<i>And I don't think</i>
<i>it was the accommodations.</i>

33:12.691 --> 33:15.683
<i>I mean this place sure beats</i>
<i>the heck out of the Y.</i>

33:15.794 --> 33:18.957
<i>It was something</i>
<i>about this case</i>
<i>that was bothering me.</i>

33:19.031 --> 33:22.159
<i>And it was more than the fact</i>
<i>that we'd run out of leads.</i>

33:22.234 --> 33:26.170
<i>It was the butler cat.</i>
<i>Something about him</i>
<i>just wasn't right.</i>

33:26.538 --> 33:28.768
<i>I mean, every other time</i>
<i>I've come out here,</i>

33:28.840 --> 33:32.071
<i>I mean he's crazy</i>
<i>and everything, but he's cool.</i>

33:32.144 --> 33:33.805
<i>And this time, he ain't.</i>

33:34.079 --> 33:36.877
<i>Like this case was personal</i>
<i>to him or something.</i>

33:37.683 --> 33:41.779
<i>Now, it ain't my nature</i>
<i>to be snooping around</i>
<i>someone's private stuff,</i>

33:42.220 --> 33:45.485
<i>but Rule Number 41 says</i>
<i>you can make an exception,</i>

33:45.657 --> 33:48.592
<i>if you think your client's</i>
<i>not telling the whole story.</i>

33:48.660 --> 33:52.357
<i>And in this case, I didn't</i>
<i>think the butler was.</i>

33:58.003 --> 33:59.994
I demand an explanation.

34:00.806 --> 34:02.330
Why don't you go first?

34:03.508 --> 34:08.002
You can start by explaining
why you didn't tell us that
this kid we're trying to save

34:08.947 --> 34:10.414
is yours.

34:19.614 --> 34:23.710
Do you remember
where you were in the spring
of '54, Mr. Gillis?

34:26.147 --> 34:28.741
Did you idle your youth
away on the back streets,

34:28.817 --> 34:31.513
fire escapes
and stoops of the city?

34:33.621 --> 34:36.112
Were you
in love, Mr. Gillis?

34:36.357 --> 34:37.346
No.

34:37.726 --> 34:39.318
I've seen it, though.

34:39.960 --> 34:43.158
That year I was with
the Saint Louis Browns
in St. Pete.

34:43.898 --> 34:45.525
It was Spring training.

34:45.967 --> 34:47.958
A client of mine asked me
to find his wife.

34:48.036 --> 34:49.867
She'd run off
with the third-base coach.

34:49.938 --> 34:53.840
I followed the club down
there and pretended I was
a rookie trying out.

34:53.908 --> 34:56.877
Third base.
They cut me, though.
I wasn't good enough.

34:57.712 --> 34:59.339
What about the case?

34:59.414 --> 35:00.540
I was fired.

35:01.816 --> 35:03.841
You didn't catch them?

35:05.453 --> 35:06.886
Of course I did.

35:07.088 --> 35:09.818
We're talking
Luther H. Gillis, P.I., here.

35:10.358 --> 35:12.087
Of course I caught them.

35:12.627 --> 35:16.324
Actually, that was
the only thing I did catch
during Spring training.

35:16.798 --> 35:20.859
But I let them slide.
I let them get away with it.

35:21.136 --> 35:22.160
Why?

35:22.837 --> 35:26.170
Well, the more I watched them,
the more I realized
they were in love.

35:26.641 --> 35:29.007
And when it's the real thing,
you can tell.

35:29.744 --> 35:31.075
I could tell.

35:32.180 --> 35:34.774
I let them slide.
I let them slide.

35:36.384 --> 35:40.480
But what's all this got to
do with extortion, blackmail,
murder and your kid?

35:40.622 --> 35:41.953
I'm not sure.

35:42.624 --> 35:45.752
Except that if you've ever
had the experience of having

35:46.094 --> 35:48.426
loved and lost,

35:49.430 --> 35:53.560
you might be able
to understand the story
I'm about to tell you.

35:54.836 --> 35:57.999
I spent my Spring
of '54 in Kenya,

35:58.406 --> 36:01.739
which is far, far
removed from St. Pete.

36:02.477 --> 36:04.104
There was a war on.

36:04.779 --> 36:07.339
There always seemed to be
a war on, I suppose.

36:08.316 --> 36:10.750
And our squad was
assigned the duty of

36:10.819 --> 36:13.845
guarding the Andrews farm
from the marauding Mau Mau.

36:14.789 --> 36:17.519
We were there three months,
six of us.

36:18.226 --> 36:20.319
I was the youngest,

36:20.895 --> 36:23.625
and quite naturally,

36:23.865 --> 36:27.198
a bond was established between
the only Andrews daughter,

36:27.268 --> 36:28.963
Elizabeth, and myself.

36:30.004 --> 36:31.494
I'm getting the picture.

36:33.508 --> 36:35.908
We would take long walks
in the grass,

36:37.045 --> 36:38.410
read Shelley,

36:39.547 --> 36:41.606
listen to the BBC at night.

36:42.150 --> 36:44.311
Now I'm really
getting the picture.

36:45.854 --> 36:50.291
The war seemed so far away,
so removed.

36:52.293 --> 36:55.387
That is, until
I was transferred
back to the front.

36:55.763 --> 36:58.129
So long, BBC in the dark.

36:58.867 --> 36:59.959
Quite.

37:01.202 --> 37:05.502
Another squad was sent
in to guard the Andrews farm
in our place.

37:07.508 --> 37:11.376
Four months later, I received
a letter from Elizabeth.

37:12.814 --> 37:15.783
The language was polite,

37:15.917 --> 37:18.818
cool, dispassionate.

37:18.887 --> 37:19.911
Yeah.

37:21.122 --> 37:23.386
Apparently, Elizabeth
became involved

37:23.458 --> 37:26.018
with one of the soldiers
sent in to replace me.

37:27.495 --> 37:30.259
Fate is indeed fickle,
Mr. Gillis.

37:30.832 --> 37:32.561
Yeah? Why's that?

37:33.735 --> 37:37.569
Because the man
Elizabeth chose to dispense
her affections to

37:38.206 --> 37:40.970
was none other
than Dan Davies.

37:45.313 --> 37:47.645
The one who owns
the tuna fish boat?

37:49.350 --> 37:50.783
The same.

37:54.022 --> 37:58.584
<i>A wise man named</i>
<i>Branch Rickey once wrote that</i>
<i>luck is the residue of design.</i>

37:59.193 --> 38:02.720
<i>And I would have liked to</i>
<i>think that figuring out</i>
<i>who was embezzling the funds</i>

38:02.797 --> 38:05.823
<i>was something I'd planned</i>
<i>and systematically executed.</i>

38:06.000 --> 38:09.663
<i>However, only I
<i>and the program knew
<i>I got lucky.</i></i></i>

38:10.138 --> 38:12.698
<i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>for Ms. Cathcart, of course,</i>

38:12.807 --> 38:14.741
<i>I hoped she had a good lawyer.</i>

38:15.209 --> 38:17.234
<i>On the other hand,</i>
<i>maybe Mr. Rickey's</i>

38:17.312 --> 38:19.678
<i>"residue of design"</i>
<i>could be equated with</i>

38:19.747 --> 38:21.578
<i>Mr. Magnum's little voice.</i>

38:21.849 --> 38:24.215
<i>And maybe that could be</i>
<i>equated with a little more</i>

38:24.285 --> 38:28.278
<i>up time on Robin's</i>
<i>miracle machine and its mate</i>
<i>down at police records,</i>

38:28.923 --> 38:31.551
<i>because I've seen</i>
<i>Jonathan Quayle Higgins</i>

38:31.626 --> 38:34.459
<i>in just about every possible</i>
<i>kind of circumstance,</i>

38:34.929 --> 38:36.863
<i>but I've never seen him break.</i>

38:37.231 --> 38:42.066
<i>In other words,</i>
<i>maybe the late Warren Brummer</i>
<i>wasn't quite history yet.</i>

38:44.472 --> 38:46.030
What are you doing in there?

38:47.375 --> 38:50.367
Come on. If you're doing
what I think you're doing,

38:50.445 --> 38:52.845
why didn't you phone her?
It would have been easier.

38:52.914 --> 38:56.008
You could've found out
if the little sucker
was yours or not.

38:56.084 --> 38:58.814
You could have found out
if there even was
a little sucker.

38:58.886 --> 39:00.911
They could've faked
the pictures.

39:02.190 --> 39:04.556
You could've. Why?
Why didn't you?

39:08.863 --> 39:10.694
Why didn't you call her?

39:11.899 --> 39:13.799
I forgot.
The alien concept of honor,

39:13.868 --> 39:16.428
all that stuff
I'm supposed to know
nothing about.

39:16.504 --> 39:19.371
Well, maybe it ain't honor
that kept you from making
that phone call.

39:19.440 --> 39:20.873
Maybe it was pride,

39:22.577 --> 39:24.408
something I know
a lot about.

39:25.880 --> 39:27.040
Believe me.

39:28.016 --> 39:31.508
Now, you tell me
what you want to do,
and we'll do it together.

39:32.954 --> 39:34.353
Thank you.

39:34.422 --> 39:35.684
Don't mention it.

39:37.492 --> 39:39.483
Now here's what I think
we ought to do.

39:39.560 --> 39:41.551
I think we ought to get down
to that tuna fish boat,

39:41.629 --> 39:43.620
sneak on,
shake down your pal Davies,

39:43.698 --> 39:45.666
and 86 the goods
he has on you.

39:46.701 --> 39:48.032
Whether they're real or not?

39:48.102 --> 39:49.626
Does it make a difference?

39:49.704 --> 39:52.036
They still work as far as
blackmailing's concerned.

39:52.106 --> 39:54.267
They'll still mess up
your lady friend's career.

39:54.342 --> 39:57.072
Does it really make
a difference whether
they're fake or not?

39:57.845 --> 39:59.278
I suppose not.

40:01.249 --> 40:02.716
Except

40:04.652 --> 40:06.415
if the documents are real,

40:07.855 --> 40:10.153
and if I really do have a son,

40:11.192 --> 40:15.686
wouldn't I be jeopardizing
his very existence
by this rash an act?

40:16.397 --> 40:19.332
What are you planning to do
with that? Target practice?

40:19.400 --> 40:21.334
Shoot fish in a barrel?

40:21.636 --> 40:25.629
But perhaps I'm being hasty,
acting emotionally.

40:26.908 --> 40:29.536
For if I do have a son...

40:29.911 --> 40:31.936
There's only one way
to find out.

40:32.246 --> 40:34.441
But by forcing Davies' hand,

40:35.616 --> 40:37.311
I may not ever see him.

40:41.856 --> 40:45.792
Can you understand
the empty, aching feeling
of having fathered a child

40:46.427 --> 40:48.918
and not ever sharing
in the raising of him?

40:50.098 --> 40:51.292
Or her.

40:54.735 --> 40:55.963
Of course.

40:58.172 --> 40:59.639
I forgot.

41:00.741 --> 41:02.140
I'm sorry.

41:03.177 --> 41:05.839
Sorry is for sissies.
Let's go.

41:18.392 --> 41:20.053
What if there's
another watchman?

41:20.161 --> 41:22.994
I doubt it. I think
they got a high turnover
around here.

41:28.870 --> 41:30.360
Perhaps he's asleep.

41:30.438 --> 41:32.599
Or he's out for
an early morning jog.

41:33.141 --> 41:35.507
Either way, there's
one way to find out.

41:37.311 --> 41:39.506
Now, be careful.
You just can't walk
on these things

41:39.580 --> 41:41.309
like you're taking
a stroll in the park.

41:41.382 --> 41:44.374
You got to roll with the flow,
get your sea legs.

41:51.092 --> 41:52.582
Well, what do you want?

41:52.660 --> 41:54.184
The last time I was in a boat,

41:54.262 --> 41:55.820
my hands were strapped
to the oars

41:55.897 --> 41:58.058
and Blanche was feeding
my lunch to the ducks.

41:58.132 --> 41:59.656
I tried to stop her.
I lifted the oars out...

41:59.734 --> 42:01.031
Well, you had to be there.

42:01.102 --> 42:02.364
Look here.

42:02.503 --> 42:04.130
Well, let's get to work.

42:04.939 --> 42:08.670
Please, I once cracked
the safe of the Nazi
High Command in Rome.

42:08.809 --> 42:10.174
Well, excuse me.

42:10.244 --> 42:12.804
And an intense hour
that was indeed.

42:12.880 --> 42:15.849
For directly in the next room
was General Froelich himself

42:15.917 --> 42:18.044
with one of
Mussolini's mistresses.

42:18.352 --> 42:19.819
The pressure was intense,

42:19.887 --> 42:23.823
and I could barely hear
the clicking of the tumblers
over the constant shrieking...

42:23.891 --> 42:26.655
Come on! Come on!
This is taking too long.
Nonsense.

42:35.636 --> 42:37.126
That the goods?

42:39.974 --> 42:43.933
It says here she gave up
the kid for adoption
on January 1st, 1955.

42:44.145 --> 42:48.138
Happy New Year.
So much for the Spring of '54.
Where's my Bic?

42:50.551 --> 42:53.543
Give it to me!
Come on! Come on!

42:54.255 --> 42:57.383
If it is your kid,
all we're burning
is the picture.

42:57.825 --> 42:59.315
Come on!

43:04.999 --> 43:06.728
We'll call the police,
they'll pick up Davies,

43:06.801 --> 43:08.393
you'll be reunited
with your kid.

43:08.736 --> 43:11.830
Why wait when we can
have one right here?

43:16.777 --> 43:18.005
Son?

43:18.579 --> 43:19.773
Wrong.

43:20.047 --> 43:22.242
Well, the good thing is,
at least you know.

43:22.316 --> 43:25.012
The bad thing is these cruds
are gonna kill us.

43:25.419 --> 43:28.388
That would be stupid
and rather incriminating.

43:29.657 --> 43:31.488
A fire on the other hand...

43:31.559 --> 43:33.151
Yeah, fish sticks.

43:33.461 --> 43:34.894
Lock the door on your way out.

43:34.962 --> 43:36.725
Wait a minute!
Maybe we could talk.

43:36.797 --> 43:40.824
We tried.
We did call the estate.
We could have negotiated.

43:40.901 --> 43:45.065
One final payment.
But you weren't there,
Higgins.

43:45.206 --> 43:46.764
You came to us.

43:47.608 --> 43:50.600
So you left us
no other choice.
Come on, hurry it up.

43:50.678 --> 43:54.739
Wait! There happens to be
a guy behind you with a gun.

43:54.815 --> 43:58.046
Last time I heard that,
it was Bugs Bunny
to Yosemite Sam

43:58.119 --> 43:59.984
and he didn't fall
for it either.
Hi, guys.

44:04.058 --> 44:06.788
Hey, big guy,
put the fire out,
when you're done.

44:33.120 --> 44:35.748
Give me the gun,
and I'll see
they go easy on you.

44:40.027 --> 44:41.255
I lied.

44:42.096 --> 44:44.030
He's all yours, Hig.

44:48.502 --> 44:50.993
You stole more than my money.

44:51.372 --> 44:53.738
You took my honor and pride.

44:55.009 --> 44:57.000
I was counting
on that, Higgins.

44:58.713 --> 45:00.544
Well, count on this.

45:11.992 --> 45:13.755
Do you think
he's in, Magnum?

45:13.828 --> 45:15.693
Well, where else
is he going to be?

45:16.197 --> 45:19.064
He sleeps here. He still
doesn't have a phone.

45:19.433 --> 45:22.459
And you didn't have to
come all the way
down here, Higgins.

45:22.536 --> 45:24.128
I could've paid him.

45:24.205 --> 45:26.196
Or you could've sent him
his check in the mail.

45:26.273 --> 45:28.298
As if paying
a utility bill?

45:28.376 --> 45:31.868
Luther Gillis
did far more than just
help solve the case.

45:31.946 --> 45:33.413
I know that.

45:34.115 --> 45:35.582
It's just that...

45:36.417 --> 45:37.543
What?

45:38.919 --> 45:40.147
Nothing.

45:41.355 --> 45:42.617
What?

45:44.058 --> 45:45.082
What?

45:45.159 --> 45:46.217
I'm sorry.

45:48.229 --> 45:52.598
I'm sorry for taking
your problem so lightly.

45:58.539 --> 45:59.733
Luther?

46:01.442 --> 46:02.670
Luther?

46:04.044 --> 46:05.534
Bet he's asleep.

46:25.533 --> 46:26.830
"Dear Butler..."

46:28.669 --> 46:30.000
It's for you.

46:38.712 --> 46:40.577
"Dear Butler,

46:41.682 --> 46:44.708
"thanks for letting me
work for you.

46:44.785 --> 46:46.980
"And the big guy, too.

46:47.288 --> 46:51.588
"If he hadn't have figured
out the Davies connection
on the computer,

46:51.692 --> 46:54.183
"we would've been
goners for sure.

46:54.929 --> 46:57.124
"Anyway, this whole case

46:57.198 --> 47:00.634
"kind of made me think about
stuff we were talking about.

47:01.335 --> 47:05.863
"Like Blanche. Like really
having a woman who loves you.

47:07.308 --> 47:09.401
"My kids."

47:11.612 --> 47:14.410
<i>Sorry, I was about</i>
<i>to make myself sick.</i>

47:14.548 --> 47:18.143
<i>The truth of the matter</i>
<i>is I can't stand</i>
<i>the damn weather out here.</i>

47:18.219 --> 47:22.280
<i>It never snows,</i>
<i>and you ain't got</i>
<i>a major league ball club.</i>

47:22.823 --> 47:24.916
<i>I'm going back</i>
<i>to St. Louis.</i>

47:28.195 --> 47:31.528
<i>And Blanche has got</i>
<i>absolutely nothing to do</i>
<i>with it.</i>

47:32.066 --> 47:33.431
<i>Nothing.</i>

47:33.501 --> 47:34.832
<i>Cheers.</i>

47:37.204 --> 47:40.071
<i>Luther H. Gillis, P.I.</i>
