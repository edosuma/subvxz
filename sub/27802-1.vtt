Subtitles by explosiveskull

02:30.173 --> 02:32.606
I am an O-ring expert.

02:32.608 --> 02:34.706
I worked on the
Solid Rocket Boosters

02:34.708 --> 02:36.406
for the Space Shuttle
Challenger.

02:37.740 --> 02:39.438
So you work for NASA?

02:39.440 --> 02:41.503
No.

02:41.505 --> 02:43.805
I worked for the company
in Utah

02:43.807 --> 02:46.473
that was contracted
to build rockets for NASA.

02:47.573 --> 02:48.837
You work there now?

02:49.506 --> 02:51.339
No.

02:51.341 --> 02:53.504
And your responsibilities
were...

02:53.506 --> 02:54.570
what?

02:56.508 --> 02:59.371
I was appointed to the
Special Seals Integrity Unit.

02:59.373 --> 03:04.738
And I would make inspections
for the recovered rockets

03:04.740 --> 03:06.938
and the rockets
that were ready for launch.

03:06.940 --> 03:09.371
And on the night in question
during the telecon,

03:09.373 --> 03:10.671
I made my findings clear.

03:10.673 --> 03:13.406
Just a moment, please.
We will get to that later.

03:13.408 --> 03:14.937
During the presidential
commission,

03:14.939 --> 03:16.504
my colleagues and I
expressed our concern.

03:16.506 --> 03:19.174
We will get to that later.

03:19.176 --> 03:21.237
I'm here to bring
a billion-dollar civil suit

03:21.239 --> 03:22.138
against my company,

03:22.140 --> 03:24.205
so what do you want to know
right now?

03:24.207 --> 03:27.204
I'm here to determine
if you are a victim,

03:27.206 --> 03:29.570
or if you are the cause
of the problem

03:29.572 --> 03:31.270
before we take your case.

03:32.305 --> 03:34.703
I'm not the problem.

03:34.705 --> 03:38.304
You were responsible
for the O-rings, correct?

03:40.572 --> 03:41.570
Yes.

03:43.705 --> 03:46.204
Did anyone work for you
or with you?

03:48.638 --> 03:50.237
What does that matter?

03:50.239 --> 03:53.806
Because what you are proposing
we do with your case

03:53.808 --> 03:56.639
won't be like the Presidential
Commission hearings.

03:56.641 --> 03:59.803
In the Court of Public Opinion,
perception matters.

03:59.805 --> 04:03.572
Now, was anyone working for you
or with you?

04:03.574 --> 04:06.705
I didn't have any employees
working for me, so what?

04:07.408 --> 04:08.839
I'm responsible?

04:08.841 --> 04:11.171
Didn't take you long
to us get there, did it?

04:13.539 --> 04:15.372
I'm here to protect you.

04:15.374 --> 04:16.502
Protect us from what?

04:16.504 --> 04:18.738
Well, I heard
about what you did,

04:18.741 --> 04:21.339
which was a great thing.

04:21.341 --> 04:22.570
You saw something
that concerned you

04:22.572 --> 04:24.539
and you spoke up about it.

04:24.541 --> 04:27.539
I'm the one
that tried to stop it.

04:27.541 --> 04:30.405
The future of the space program
was in our hands.

04:30.407 --> 04:32.305
And seven lives.

04:34.473 --> 04:36.805
And seven lives.

04:36.807 --> 04:39.336
There are gonna be a lot
of accusations,

04:39.338 --> 04:40.872
a lot of questions,

04:40.874 --> 04:42.606
but this is our chance, that...

04:42.608 --> 04:47.272
I mean, our story,
as a team, is heard.

04:47.274 --> 04:48.940
Did you know that
the Space Shuttle Challenger

04:48.942 --> 04:50.606
was set to launch
the day before?

04:53.741 --> 04:55.208
And had it launched,

04:55.210 --> 04:57.407
everything would have been
perfectly fine.

05:00.676 --> 05:02.771
If not for a jammed up
door handle

05:02.773 --> 05:04.472
on the outer hull of the hatch.

05:42.241 --> 05:43.371
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

05:44.442 --> 05:45.572
No, sir.

05:46.940 --> 05:48.671
Yes, sir, we're working on it.

05:50.875 --> 05:52.037
Yes, sir.

05:52.039 --> 05:55.170
There were a lot of factors
that contributed to this.

05:57.239 --> 06:00.273
In 1986, the space program
was attempting to launch

06:00.275 --> 06:02.441
24 shuttles a year.

06:02.443 --> 06:04.239
We're really
gonna work on a spaceship

06:04.241 --> 06:05.540
with a hacksaw?

06:05.542 --> 06:06.774
Should we get the drill?

06:06.776 --> 06:08.276
I don't know.

06:08.278 --> 06:10.306
They weren't even getting close.

06:10.308 --> 06:12.539
The most we got was ten.

06:12.541 --> 06:14.339
I think they should send Mike
up with the drill.

06:16.341 --> 06:18.407
You guys sending Mike up?

06:18.409 --> 06:19.406
It was embarrassing.

06:21.241 --> 06:23.840
And only added pressure on us
to launch.

06:23.842 --> 06:25.739
- What'd they say?
- Mike's coming up.

06:37.941 --> 06:39.205
I'll do it.

06:57.775 --> 06:58.840
Got it.

07:05.374 --> 07:07.139
Yes, sir. We got it.

07:09.610 --> 07:10.707
Okay.

07:13.608 --> 07:14.605
Okay.

07:16.406 --> 07:18.438
Okay. Well, I'll let them know,
but I think...

07:20.876 --> 07:22.474
Yes, sir, I'll let them know.

07:24.641 --> 07:25.840
What's going on?

07:25.842 --> 07:27.437
They're pushing launch
to tomorrow.

07:27.439 --> 07:28.506
Put it back on.

07:28.508 --> 07:29.605
Okay.

07:41.574 --> 07:42.842
- Five minutes to finish.
- Okay.

07:42.844 --> 07:44.108
Emma!

07:45.409 --> 07:47.339
Five minutes to get ready.

07:48.710 --> 07:50.405
Dad makes the rockets?

07:50.407 --> 07:52.705
No, dummy, he seals them.

07:52.707 --> 07:54.273
- Don't say "dummy."
- Stop!

07:54.908 --> 07:56.673
Stop. Mom!

07:56.675 --> 07:58.507
- Stop it.
- I'm trying to show her.

07:58.509 --> 08:00.408
- Stop! Stop!
- The rocket is broken up

08:00.410 --> 08:02.740
into pieces and he makes sure
they are sealed

08:02.742 --> 08:05.307
- when they go back together.
- Stop that. Come here.

08:06.575 --> 08:08.541
I was trying to show her.

08:08.543 --> 08:12.239
Name-calling and bullying
accomplishes nothing.

08:12.241 --> 08:13.541
But Dad says being right
is what matters.

08:13.543 --> 08:15.674
Dad, tell her
you make the rockets.

08:15.676 --> 08:17.472
I seal the rockets.

08:17.474 --> 08:18.607
See?

08:18.609 --> 08:20.174
And that's part
of making the rockets.

08:20.176 --> 08:21.475
- See?
- Come on, let's go.

08:21.477 --> 08:22.610
We're gonna be late.

08:22.612 --> 08:25.939
Let's go, let's go.
Five, four, three, two...

08:25.941 --> 08:27.240
Don't forget your lunch.

08:27.242 --> 08:28.605
...one.

08:28.607 --> 08:29.704
Emma, hey.

08:32.876 --> 08:34.673
- Dad?
- Yep?

08:34.674 --> 08:36.341
Is the shuttle launching today?

08:36.342 --> 08:37.539
Nope. You're good.

08:37.542 --> 08:38.442
Wait. Why not?

08:38.443 --> 08:40.640
Those idiots
can't get anything right.

08:40.642 --> 08:42.442
Don't say "idiots."

08:42.443 --> 08:44.776
And just remember how
you're right is important, too.

08:46.176 --> 08:47.672
There's only one way
to be right.

08:49.277 --> 08:50.442
<i>Dad?</i>

08:50.444 --> 08:52.741
<i>Yeah?</i>

08:52.743 --> 08:56.243
Does everybody work
at the company you work for?

08:56.245 --> 08:57.373
Mostly.

08:57.375 --> 08:59.209
How many?

08:59.211 --> 09:01.341
I don't know.
Thousands of those doo-dahs.

09:01.911 --> 09:03.108
Dad?

09:04.341 --> 09:05.806
Yes?

09:05.808 --> 09:08.207
Is Mom right or are you right?

09:10.942 --> 09:13.604
Now that's
the right question to be asking.

09:13.606 --> 09:15.507
Don't you ever forget that.

09:15.509 --> 09:18.842
In our family,
we do what's right, okay?

09:18.844 --> 09:21.706
- What does that mean?
- What does that mean?

09:21.708 --> 09:23.673
That means your mom
is probably right.

09:26.708 --> 09:27.738
But we'll see.

09:33.408 --> 09:35.838
<i>Many of you
in the news media have asked</i>

09:35.840 --> 09:38.906
<i>to have an opportunity to,
uh, to hear a little a bit more</i>

09:38.908 --> 09:42.439
<i>about the events
that occurred, uh, this morning.</i>

09:42.441 --> 09:44.306
<i>Okay, thank you. You know what?</i>

09:44.308 --> 09:46.208
<i>Of course,
it was just not our day.</i>

09:46.210 --> 09:47.640
<i>Removed in the...</i>

09:47.642 --> 09:50.306
<i>the ground support
assist handle.</i>

09:50.308 --> 09:52.572
<i>And that handle
could not be removed</i>

09:52.574 --> 09:54.440
<i>because a threaded fastener</i>

09:54.442 --> 09:56.407
<i>apparently was stripped.</i>

09:56.409 --> 09:58.705
<i>And we had a little bit
of problem with the...</i>

09:58.707 --> 10:01.339
<i>the frost and the ice
on the external tank.</i>

10:01.341 --> 10:02.708
<i>And then the wind picks up.</i>

10:02.710 --> 10:06.740
<i>Uh, we we're really getting
in the condition of no go</i>

10:06.742 --> 10:09.540
<i>from the standpoint
of RTLS crosswind.</i>

10:09.542 --> 10:12.507
<i>Today also, we used
a hacksaw on the, uh, vault.</i>

10:12.509 --> 10:15.605
<i>Well, if the, uh,
they did use a hacksaw</i>

10:15.607 --> 10:18.475
<i>to... to cut away the...
the cylinder</i>

10:18.477 --> 10:20.706
<i>on this...
this particular handle.</i>

10:20.708 --> 10:22.607
<i>What...
At what point would you say,</i>

10:22.609 --> 10:26.673
<i>tomorrow the temperature's
have caused, uh, a scrub in...</i>

10:26.675 --> 10:28.240
<i>The outside temperature,</i>

10:28.242 --> 10:29.808
<i>the absolute
outside temperature,</i>

10:29.810 --> 10:31.610
<i>we... we don't have...</i>

10:31.612 --> 10:33.707
No one seemed to care
about the space program

10:33.709 --> 10:36.209
until that stunt
with that teacher.

10:37.211 --> 10:39.607
Why do you call it a stunt?

10:39.609 --> 10:42.377
It was unnecessary.

10:42.379 --> 10:47.742
But, suddenly everyone's
interested in space again.

10:47.744 --> 10:51.208
<i>Everyone was glued
to their TVs, which meant...</i>

10:51.210 --> 10:52.475
<i>all eyes were on us.</i>

10:56.811 --> 10:58.508
Adam. Adam!

10:58.510 --> 11:00.474
When do you think
they will reschedule the launch?

11:00.476 --> 11:01.575
Not sure.

11:01.577 --> 11:03.374
Why did they scrub the launch
in the first place?

11:03.376 --> 11:04.709
I don't know.

11:04.711 --> 11:05.673
What about the...

11:05.675 --> 11:07.776
Just getting to work
like you, okay?

11:07.778 --> 11:09.408
I'm sure we'll find out.

11:09.410 --> 11:11.306
Okay. But, uh, they're
expecting the temperatures

11:11.308 --> 11:12.908
to be below freezing in Florida.

11:12.910 --> 11:14.274
Freezing in Florida?

11:14.709 --> 11:16.840
Okay.

11:16.842 --> 11:19.641
<i>The Challenger launch
was postponed three times</i>

11:19.643 --> 11:21.744
and scrubbed once
from the planned date

11:21.746 --> 11:24.308
of January 22, 1986.

11:24.310 --> 11:25.341
Correct.

11:25.343 --> 11:28.841
They have a way of twisting
your words around

11:28.843 --> 11:29.977
and using them against you.

11:29.979 --> 11:34.341
Would the other launches
have resulted in O-ring failures

11:34.343 --> 11:35.576
had they taken place?

11:35.578 --> 11:38.809
You say one thing a little bit
different a year from now...

11:38.811 --> 11:40.808
you're on trial for perjury.

11:40.810 --> 11:44.343
I guess the other launches
would have been fine.

11:44.345 --> 11:46.843
Do you do a lot of guessing
in your line of work?

11:46.845 --> 11:48.409
<i>Florida may be experiencing</i>

11:48.411 --> 11:49.510
<i>record low temperatures,</i>

11:49.512 --> 11:51.439
<i>but the heat is still on.</i>

11:51.441 --> 11:54.209
<i>School children from around
the nation have gathered</i>

11:54.211 --> 11:57.508
<i>to watch their favorite teacher
prepare to blast off into space.</i>

11:57.510 --> 11:59.708
<i>Sadly, there will be
no launch today</i>

11:59.710 --> 12:03.841
<i>as NASA has yet again
scrubbed another shuttle launch.</i>

12:03.843 --> 12:06.911
<i>This time, because
of a jammed door handle.</i>

12:06.913 --> 12:10.741
<i>Will NASA ever launch
space shuttle Challenger?</i>

12:10.743 --> 12:12.806
I didn't find out until 1 p.m.

12:12.808 --> 12:14.941
that they planned to launch
the next morning.

12:14.943 --> 12:17.409
What was your main concern
that day?

12:17.411 --> 12:19.240
Temperature was a concern.

12:19.242 --> 12:20.775
It was the concern.

12:20.777 --> 12:23.242
And at around five o'clock,
we began to realize

12:23.244 --> 12:24.540
we were in some serious trouble.

12:24.542 --> 12:26.874
Listen to me,
I don't think you realize

12:26.876 --> 12:29.177
how deadly important this is.

12:29.179 --> 12:32.375
The shuttle is scheduled
to launch in about 16 hours,

12:32.377 --> 12:34.309
so I need to know from you guys

12:34.311 --> 12:37.442
what exactly is the temperature
going to be?

12:37.444 --> 12:39.675
- <i>In Florida?</i>
- Yes, in Florida!

12:39.677 --> 12:42.476
The rockets are in Florida.

12:42.478 --> 12:44.209
<i>I'll check, uh, let me see...</i>

12:45.512 --> 12:47.310
<i>Looks like 30 degrees.</i>

12:49.442 --> 12:51.209
And you're sure
that's Cape Canaveral,

12:51.211 --> 12:53.143
not Orlando, right?

13:05.444 --> 13:06.542
Carl, get out.

13:06.544 --> 13:08.773
- Whoa!
- It's 30 degrees right now.

13:08.775 --> 13:10.339
- So?
- In Florida.

13:11.676 --> 13:13.576
- Are you sure?
- Of course, I'm sure.

13:13.578 --> 13:15.807
Why do you think
I came storming in here?

13:15.809 --> 13:18.242
You come storming in everywhere.

13:18.244 --> 13:19.745
Is it going to get colder
than 30 degrees?

13:19.747 --> 13:21.743
What do you think?
Does it get colder at night?

13:22.478 --> 13:23.543
Fair point.

13:23.545 --> 13:24.610
- Carl.
- Mm?

13:24.612 --> 13:25.707
What do you think?

13:25.709 --> 13:27.842
That sounds serious.
I think we should tell someone.

13:27.844 --> 13:28.976
Okay, we'll get the guys
together,

13:28.978 --> 13:30.911
and we'll, um, discuss it
and then take it upstairs.

13:30.913 --> 13:33.176
Will do.

13:33.178 --> 13:35.276
Oh, um, where do you want
us to meet?

13:35.278 --> 13:36.641
Bullpen.

13:36.643 --> 13:38.208
Okay.

13:38.210 --> 13:39.541
Uh, where in the bullpen?

13:39.543 --> 13:41.645
- Oh, boy.
- Anywhere is fine, Carl.

13:41.647 --> 13:42.643
On it.

13:44.479 --> 13:45.776
This guy.

13:45.778 --> 13:47.310
You have to take it down
a notch.

13:47.312 --> 13:48.308
What?

13:48.310 --> 13:50.242
That's why nobody
listens to you, you know.

13:50.244 --> 13:51.475
The storming in.

13:51.477 --> 13:53.344
Kicking Carl out.

13:53.346 --> 13:54.542
You know he agrees with you.

13:54.544 --> 13:56.108
Oh, yeah, 'cause I'm right.

13:58.245 --> 13:59.342
Okay.

14:00.343 --> 14:02.375
What do you want to do about it?

14:02.377 --> 14:05.208
Well, what have I been
talking about?

14:05.210 --> 14:06.810
- Okay. Okay.
- For months?

14:06.812 --> 14:08.276
Dial it down.

14:10.376 --> 14:11.841
You are right.

14:13.178 --> 14:14.943
Correct. We believe you.

14:14.945 --> 14:16.575
No one has ever been righter

14:16.577 --> 14:18.510
in the history of being right!

14:18.512 --> 14:20.745
So, what should we do?

14:20.747 --> 14:23.809
Who do you want me to call?
You want me to call Reagan?

14:23.811 --> 14:25.644
How do we convince them
that you are right?

14:25.646 --> 14:27.741
Convince?
This isn't a convincing thing.

14:27.743 --> 14:29.477
You show them the numbers,
and that's the number.

14:29.479 --> 14:32.844
I know, but have the numbers
meant anything so far?

14:34.479 --> 14:35.809
No.

14:35.811 --> 14:38.407
And you've been at this
for about a year now?

14:38.409 --> 14:39.473
And?

14:41.211 --> 14:46.443
So, how do we discuss
and convince?

14:46.445 --> 14:49.440
Do you want to run
into every office hysterically?

14:49.442 --> 14:50.874
Screaming that the sky
is falling?

14:50.876 --> 14:53.609
Again, I don't understand
what you're saying right now.

14:53.611 --> 14:55.707
- These idiots...
- All right. Hold on. All right!

14:55.709 --> 14:57.643
Let's just talk to the guys
and see what they say.

14:57.645 --> 14:59.442
- That good?
- Well, it doesn't matter.

14:59.444 --> 15:01.307
Once they see the facts,
then they'll see.

15:01.309 --> 15:02.375
Adam, I'm getting a headache

15:02.377 --> 15:03.441
just thinking about this stuff.

15:03.443 --> 15:04.439
Come on, let's go.

15:14.809 --> 15:16.243
What is it, Carl?

15:16.245 --> 15:18.576
Oh, um, Adam has something
to talk about.

15:18.578 --> 15:20.375
Is it actually important?

15:20.377 --> 15:22.374
He says it's 30 degrees
in Florida.

15:25.244 --> 15:27.910
Well, then, that is important.

15:27.912 --> 15:29.376
I'll be there in a moment.

15:29.378 --> 15:30.477
Uh, Carl?

15:30.479 --> 15:31.843
Yes, Dean?

15:31.845 --> 15:33.477
Where is "there"?

15:33.479 --> 15:35.642
Oh, uh, the bullpen.

15:35.644 --> 15:38.743
Uh, Carl, where in the bullpen?

15:38.745 --> 15:40.742
Oh, I don't know. The middle?

16:01.280 --> 16:02.774
Adam and Bill wanna see us.

16:02.776 --> 16:05.543
Oh, come on.
I was just about to leave.

16:05.545 --> 16:07.511
I'm hungry. Where we going?

16:07.513 --> 16:09.644
You really need to get a handle
on this sort of stuff.

16:09.646 --> 16:10.777
Get it? Handle?

16:10.779 --> 16:13.345
Okay, are you gonna tell me
what's going on or what?

16:13.347 --> 16:14.643
Oh, we need to get Frank.

16:14.645 --> 16:15.543
Frank.

16:15.545 --> 16:17.810
Adam's not gonna like us
getting Frank.

16:17.812 --> 16:19.677
Adam doesn't like anything.
Come on.

16:27.511 --> 16:29.344
We've been summoned.

16:29.346 --> 16:31.809
Not me. I'm not here.

16:31.811 --> 16:33.809
Adam says it's 30 degrees
in Florida.

16:33.811 --> 16:35.478
Really?

16:35.480 --> 16:37.510
What is it with this guy,
and what's his problem?

16:37.512 --> 16:39.843
I don't know. Let's go find out.

16:39.845 --> 16:42.477
I need you guys
to back me up on this in there.

16:42.479 --> 16:44.477
Maybe we should hear him out,
you know, just in case.

16:44.479 --> 16:46.679
He has been going on
about this for a year,

16:46.681 --> 16:47.942
I'm sick of it.

16:47.944 --> 16:49.411
The sooner this is over with,

16:49.413 --> 16:51.844
the sooner
we can get some dinner.

16:51.846 --> 16:53.911
Hey, guys, what's happening?
Happy hour?

16:53.913 --> 16:56.177
Can somebody tell me
why I'm not at home

16:56.179 --> 16:57.745
having dinner right now?

16:57.747 --> 16:59.576
What is the problem?

16:59.578 --> 17:01.310
It's too cold to launch.

17:01.312 --> 17:02.744
Really?

17:02.746 --> 17:06.212
It's too cold to light up
a million pounds of rocket fuel?

17:06.214 --> 17:07.310
What's he doing here?

17:07.313 --> 17:10.209
I thought we could use
as many people as possible.

17:10.211 --> 17:11.678
Let me ask you this,

17:11.680 --> 17:14.678
how does rocket fuel do
when it's spewing out the side

17:14.680 --> 17:16.743
instead of the bottom,
Von Braun?

17:16.746 --> 17:19.278
All we have to do
is take this memo,

17:19.280 --> 17:20.579
show 'em the facts,

17:20.582 --> 17:22.343
and then NASA
will reschedule the launch

17:22.345 --> 17:24.644
till later in the day
or when it warms up.

17:24.646 --> 17:25.675
It's all in the memo.

17:27.711 --> 17:28.741
The memo?

17:29.813 --> 17:31.277
Yes, the memo.

17:32.478 --> 17:34.244
Tell them what's on the memo?

17:34.246 --> 17:35.876
I've been working on this
for over a year.

17:35.878 --> 17:37.077
It has all my findings.

17:37.079 --> 17:39.576
And now you're gonna tell me
that none of you read my memo?

17:39.578 --> 17:40.642
- I read it.
- I didn't read it.

17:40.644 --> 17:42.479
- I skimmed it.
- Okay.

17:42.481 --> 17:45.377
It's on the memo. It's cold.
What does it mean?

17:45.379 --> 17:47.277
Do you have a problem?

17:47.279 --> 17:48.344
- Guys.
- You know something?

17:48.346 --> 17:49.342
You're like this pebble

17:49.344 --> 17:51.608
that gets under the wheel
of a shopping cart

17:51.610 --> 17:53.511
and makes it go...

17:53.513 --> 17:55.376
Oh, yeah, that's right.

17:55.378 --> 17:57.509
And you're like the guy
that can't build a shopping cart

17:57.511 --> 17:59.311
that can go over a pebble.

17:59.313 --> 18:00.442
What do you even do here?

18:00.444 --> 18:02.875
I make sure guys like you
don't torpedo our company.

18:02.877 --> 18:03.777
- Torpedo?
- Torpedo?

18:03.779 --> 18:05.542
Can we just have the facts,
gentlemen?

18:05.544 --> 18:07.374
All of this bickering
gets us nowhere.

18:08.846 --> 18:11.675
What's the coldest temperature
NASA has ever launched

18:11.677 --> 18:13.778
one of our
Solid Rocket Boosters?

18:13.780 --> 18:16.612
STS-51-C.

18:16.614 --> 18:20.645
One year ago minus three days,
third launch of Discovery,

18:20.647 --> 18:23.309
the temperature
53 degrees Fahrenheit.

18:23.311 --> 18:24.744
Wow, good job, Dean.

18:24.746 --> 18:26.877
Oh, yeah, cookies for everybody.

18:26.879 --> 18:29.711
Hey, Frank,
what's the coldest temperature

18:29.713 --> 18:32.244
we've ever tested one
of our Solid Rocket Boosters?

18:32.246 --> 18:33.643
Hey, Adam, do you get more

18:33.645 --> 18:36.644
or less erosion
at a 73-degree launch?

18:36.646 --> 18:38.611
Oh, so you did read it,

18:38.613 --> 18:40.443
and you know
there was more erosion

18:40.445 --> 18:41.846
but less blowby.

18:41.848 --> 18:44.743
You are trying to stop
this launch,

18:44.745 --> 18:46.742
and I am not going to allow it.

18:48.446 --> 18:50.179
And neither is Carl.

18:50.181 --> 18:53.645
If there was a problem,
why didn't you stop the launch?

18:53.647 --> 18:55.379
Because it wasn't up to me.

18:55.381 --> 18:57.343
I'm not the decision-maker.

18:57.345 --> 19:00.178
There is a chain of command.

19:00.180 --> 19:04.409
We are just a very small cog
in a very big machine.

19:04.411 --> 19:07.442
Seems pretty important.

19:07.444 --> 19:10.343
The shuttle is made up
of millions of parts.

19:10.345 --> 19:15.312
It is the most complex piece
of machinery in human history.

19:15.314 --> 19:19.311
The O-rings are just one piece
in a sea of pieces.

19:19.313 --> 19:20.711
And no was listening.

19:20.713 --> 19:23.279
We need to hear more
before we decide either way.

19:23.281 --> 19:24.643
Okay, shopping cart genius.

19:24.645 --> 19:27.577
Uh... Don't take my pencil.

19:27.579 --> 19:31.946
When we ship all the pieces
of our four-story rockets,

19:31.948 --> 19:35.242
and they put them
all back together at Kennedy,

19:35.244 --> 19:38.277
how do you think we keep
a million pounds of rocket fuel

19:38.279 --> 19:40.613
from spewing out
of the connection points?

19:40.615 --> 19:41.845
With our seals.

19:41.847 --> 19:45.613
And if our seals don't seal,
then everyone blows up and dies!

19:45.615 --> 19:47.243
The problem is you can't prove

19:47.245 --> 19:49.243
that the temperature
is a problem!

19:49.245 --> 19:50.845
I know, that's the problem!

19:50.847 --> 19:52.677
Is this what you guys want?

19:52.679 --> 19:56.579
You want this guy making
decisions about your future?

19:56.581 --> 19:59.511
Yeah, why are you making such
a big deal about this tonight?

19:59.513 --> 20:00.510
No.

20:00.512 --> 20:02.613
He's been on about this
for about a year now.

20:02.615 --> 20:03.743
Exactly.

20:03.745 --> 20:06.878
And none of the other
shuttle launches got stopped.

20:06.880 --> 20:10.311
When we launched in 30 degrees?

20:10.313 --> 20:11.711
You know, I think we should talk
to the boss.

20:11.713 --> 20:12.779
Run it up the chain.

20:13.881 --> 20:17.846
Guys, Adam here knows
that he cannot stop a launch

20:17.848 --> 20:20.743
unless everybody else here
is on board.

20:20.745 --> 20:23.711
And he also knows that
management is not going to stop

20:23.713 --> 20:28.279
a billion-dollar launch
without any proof.

20:28.281 --> 20:34.511
And Adam also knows
that he is just one guy.

20:39.180 --> 20:42.377
I must say, I am unconvinced.

20:43.713 --> 20:48.342
I think... we should run
this up the chain

20:48.344 --> 20:50.344
however painful it might be.

20:50.346 --> 20:51.577
Bad idea.

20:52.514 --> 20:53.380
I may be unconvinced,

20:53.382 --> 20:55.845
but this discussion needs
to happen.

20:55.847 --> 20:58.947
To do nothing at this point
would be a big mistake.

20:58.949 --> 21:00.678
Let's say we do postpone
the launch.

21:00.680 --> 21:02.710
What's the worst
that could happen?

21:02.712 --> 21:05.577
Management might find
a replacement company to build

21:05.579 --> 21:08.445
the Solid Rocket Boosters,
that's what.

21:08.447 --> 21:10.843
Oh, and also, our company,

21:10.845 --> 21:13.710
you know,
the one we still work for,

21:13.712 --> 21:15.612
they might just start
laying off people

21:15.614 --> 21:20.114
because we are the ones who
delay launches at the 13th hour.

21:20.848 --> 21:22.577
I think he has a point.

21:22.579 --> 21:24.644
We all have jobs to think about.

21:24.646 --> 21:25.777
And dinners.

21:26.848 --> 21:28.880
Don't you have a kid in college?

21:29.848 --> 21:32.346
Don't you have a mortgage?

21:32.348 --> 21:34.179
And don't you have a wife
and two kids

21:34.181 --> 21:35.944
who are depending on you?

21:35.946 --> 21:37.846
Yeah, we have
all these problems,

21:37.848 --> 21:39.377
but what's the solution here

21:39.379 --> 21:40.880
that's not killing
another launching?

21:40.882 --> 21:42.712
And what happens if we blow up
the shuttle tomorrow?

21:42.714 --> 21:43.913
What happens after that?

21:43.915 --> 21:45.812
- That is beyond ridicu...
- Come on now let's settle down.

21:45.814 --> 21:46.779
I never thought of it like that.

21:46.781 --> 21:48.679
- How's that for job security?
- Ridiculous.

21:49.811 --> 21:52.345
Adam, you can get back to them.

21:52.347 --> 21:53.779
I really admire
what you guys did.

21:53.781 --> 21:56.746
You don't have the first clue
about what we did,

21:56.748 --> 22:00.247
or what we do,
or what we will do.

22:00.249 --> 22:01.711
He's on our team.

22:01.713 --> 22:03.313
It's time you two
start acting like it.

22:03.315 --> 22:04.211
Yeah, ever since this happened

22:04.213 --> 22:05.814
management has been trying
to paint me

22:05.816 --> 22:07.846
as some kind of...

22:07.848 --> 22:10.778
malcontent employee,
bent on causing problems.

22:13.414 --> 22:15.178
Excuse us for just a minute.

22:15.180 --> 22:16.646
No, no,
it's completely all right.

22:16.648 --> 22:19.379
You're right, I don't know you.
Personally. I don't know...

22:19.381 --> 22:21.613
But I know you're a person
of conviction.

22:21.615 --> 22:24.444
And I know that you care deeply
about the space program,

22:24.446 --> 22:27.480
which is why we're all here
trying to get this sorted out.

22:27.482 --> 22:29.811
What do you make of him so far?

22:29.813 --> 22:32.612
Well, if you press him,
he falls apart.

22:32.614 --> 22:36.647
He's defensive, rude,
and difficult to deal with.

22:36.649 --> 22:38.213
Hmm.

22:38.215 --> 22:40.444
I would like to hear more,
though.

22:40.446 --> 22:45.415
Look, what we can't do
is turn on each other.

22:45.417 --> 22:49.914
I mean, yeah, let's get it
all out in here where it's safe.

22:49.916 --> 22:53.581
But out there,
we have to stick together.

22:53.583 --> 22:55.581
Are you asking us to lie?

22:55.583 --> 22:58.847
No. Nobody is advocating lying.

22:58.849 --> 23:00.880
Going back
to our previous conversation,

23:00.882 --> 23:04.747
are you a malcontent employee,
bent on causing problems?

23:04.749 --> 23:05.813
No.

23:07.550 --> 23:08.614
Maybe.

23:11.247 --> 23:13.346
Probably, but for good reason.

23:13.348 --> 23:14.745
What reason?

23:14.747 --> 23:17.279
Why can't you just talk to him
like a normal person?

23:17.281 --> 23:18.447
Be reasonable?

23:18.449 --> 23:20.312
I don't have to,
I'm right.

23:20.314 --> 23:22.778
He's just afraid
of losing his job. Hell, I am.

23:22.780 --> 23:24.780
And you're never going to win
anybody like this.

23:24.782 --> 23:26.344
This needs to stay
an engineering question,

23:26.346 --> 23:27.412
that's what.

23:27.414 --> 23:31.179
If we go to the boss like this,
we'll get nowhere.

23:31.181 --> 23:32.279
Who? Kurt?

23:32.281 --> 23:34.180
Why aren't we marching up
to his office right now?

23:34.182 --> 23:37.211
I thought we would have
a brief, calm conversation,

23:37.213 --> 23:39.778
come up with an agreement
together,

23:39.780 --> 23:42.612
and then walk up there
with a proposal.

23:42.614 --> 23:44.381
But I didn't anticipate this
or Frank.

23:44.383 --> 23:45.680
Why do we need to take a problem

23:45.682 --> 23:47.611
that has no solution
to our boss?

23:47.613 --> 23:49.279
There's at least
two other engineers

23:49.281 --> 23:50.278
that think we have a problem.

23:50.280 --> 23:52.681
As soon as we go,
Frank is gonna follow us.

23:52.683 --> 23:53.945
And as soon as we get up there,

23:53.947 --> 23:56.946
he's gonna throw around
his credentials.

23:56.948 --> 23:58.347
Problem Review Board this

23:58.349 --> 24:00.180
and problem assessment
systems that,

24:00.182 --> 24:01.312
and nothing's gonna happen.

24:03.550 --> 24:04.680
Adam.

24:04.682 --> 24:06.846
- I'm getting Jim on the phone.
- Just hold on.

24:06.848 --> 24:08.347
Let's just see
how we're gonna grade

24:08.349 --> 24:09.877
and keep Frank away
for a few minutes.

24:09.879 --> 24:13.613
Get Jim on the phone,
get him on our side.

24:13.615 --> 24:16.279
Have him call Kurt.

24:16.281 --> 24:18.445
And make it seem
like Cape Canaveral

24:18.447 --> 24:21.712
is asking for a flight ready
review meeting.

24:21.714 --> 24:24.914
Jim can make everyone concerned
about the temperature.

24:24.916 --> 24:26.544
This is a farce.

24:26.546 --> 24:29.847
- We are engineers. We're not...
- No. We're not engineers.

24:29.849 --> 24:31.282
We're people.

24:31.284 --> 24:32.611
Dumb, emotional people.

24:32.613 --> 24:35.812
Well, thanks for the psychology
lesson, Professor.

24:35.814 --> 24:39.679
Right now, I'm more interested
in rockets exploding.

24:39.681 --> 24:42.614
Did it ever occur to you
that your interpersonal skills

24:42.616 --> 24:45.947
may have hindered your ability
to convince your coworkers?

24:45.949 --> 24:49.512
Yeah, if that isn't the
understatement of a lifetime.

24:49.514 --> 24:51.312
Is this guy the best you got?

24:52.783 --> 24:54.380
I was right.

24:58.415 --> 24:59.814
When you were
in engineering school,

24:59.816 --> 25:01.414
did they make you show
your work?

25:02.815 --> 25:04.447
What does that have to do
with anything?

25:04.449 --> 25:07.346
Did they make you show them
your work?

25:07.348 --> 25:09.948
When you were solving problems
and analyzing potatoes?

25:09.950 --> 25:10.949
So what if they did?

25:10.951 --> 25:12.813
Well, you're gonna show
your work here.

25:12.815 --> 25:15.514
Because it's not good enough
to just say you were right.

25:15.516 --> 25:16.912
Anyone can make a prediction.

25:16.914 --> 25:18.648
It's gonna rain.

25:18.650 --> 25:20.914
I wanna know how you knew.

25:20.916 --> 25:24.314
And I want to know
how you told them.

25:24.316 --> 25:28.478
Because maybe the problem
wasn't with their understanding.

25:28.480 --> 25:31.413
Maybe the problem was
with how it was communicated.

25:31.415 --> 25:32.712
And that's on you.

25:34.514 --> 25:36.747
So how exactly
did you maneuver yourself

25:36.749 --> 25:38.248
through the chain of command

25:38.250 --> 25:40.614
to get the new information
to the Cape.

25:43.283 --> 25:44.849
How do we get the Cape
on the phone

25:44.851 --> 25:46.480
without Frank knowing about it?

25:49.250 --> 25:51.946
Hey, I thought you said
Carl was on my side.

25:51.948 --> 25:55.583
Why don't we just take Frank
to the recovery facility?

25:55.585 --> 25:56.847
- Show him the soot.
- What?

25:56.849 --> 25:58.048
Yeah, that'll work.

25:58.050 --> 26:01.182
And then you just go ahead
and think of a way to break off

26:01.184 --> 26:03.445
and go to your office and get
some papers or something.

26:03.447 --> 26:04.381
I'm not playing games.

26:04.383 --> 26:06.182
Just think of a good reason
to break off

26:06.184 --> 26:07.378
as soon as we get going,
all right?

26:07.380 --> 26:09.713
Bill had a way
that he wanted to do things.

26:09.715 --> 26:12.281
And did you agree with Bill?

26:12.283 --> 26:15.181
Okay, fellas, we are going
to the recovery facility.

26:15.183 --> 26:17.482
Does fluorocarbon elastomer
work better or worse

26:17.484 --> 26:18.579
in freezing temperatures?

26:18.581 --> 26:20.915
What is fluoro... elastic?

26:20.917 --> 26:23.881
It's the seal. And no,
rubber-like substances

26:23.883 --> 26:25.812
do not work better
in the freezing cold.

26:25.814 --> 26:29.582
Exactly, cold rubber
doesn't seal as well.

26:29.584 --> 26:30.679
I want us to go.

26:30.681 --> 26:33.481
What difference do a few degrees
make about anything?

26:33.483 --> 26:35.611
Dean does water freeze
at 33 degrees?

26:35.613 --> 26:37.446
No, it does not.

26:37.448 --> 26:38.847
But it does at 32.

26:38.849 --> 26:40.348
That's right. A single degree
can make a difference.

26:40.350 --> 26:42.313
And it can affect
that fluorocarbon elastomer.

26:42.315 --> 26:43.448
You guys are hopeless.

26:43.450 --> 26:46.416
Help me understand why
you weren't taking the advice

26:46.418 --> 26:48.781
of your problem assessment
specialist.

26:48.783 --> 26:51.415
Who? Frank? Are you kidding me?

26:51.417 --> 26:54.548
You should be asking me why
didn't everyone take my advice.

26:54.550 --> 26:55.481
You're not going to convince me

26:55.483 --> 26:57.448
to put everyone's jobs here
in jeopardy

26:57.450 --> 26:59.246
on some theory
you can't even come up with!

26:59.248 --> 27:00.713
Jobs? That's your criteria?

27:00.715 --> 27:03.379
Maybe you should've done
your actual job.

27:03.381 --> 27:05.681
Now it's time for the smart guys
to do their jobs.

27:05.683 --> 27:07.382
You're willing
to kill people for jobs?

27:07.384 --> 27:08.549
You self-righteous...

27:08.551 --> 27:09.747
Frank! Frank!

27:09.749 --> 27:11.282
I'm not the problem.

27:11.284 --> 27:13.382
I've just about had enough
of this.

27:13.384 --> 27:14.516
Guys.

27:14.518 --> 27:16.280
Relax.

27:16.282 --> 27:18.548
Okay, we have to get
to the bottom of this.

27:18.550 --> 27:20.212
It may be uncomfortable,

27:20.214 --> 27:21.881
but you need
to tell me the truth.

27:21.883 --> 27:23.346
Get...

27:23.348 --> 27:24.346
Hey!

27:25.385 --> 27:26.314
Where is he going?

27:26.316 --> 27:28.215
I think he's got something
in his office.

27:28.217 --> 27:29.481
Did you forget something
in your office?

27:29.483 --> 27:30.580
No!

27:39.349 --> 27:41.583
If the recovery boats come in,

27:41.585 --> 27:43.483
they want to know
what that means.

27:46.716 --> 27:50.915
It means our rockets will
get lost in the Atlantic Ocean.

27:50.917 --> 27:53.382
Those things are expensive.
We better not lose them.

27:55.416 --> 27:57.315
Is that option on the table?

27:57.317 --> 27:59.812
They wanna know
what this will mean to NASA.

27:59.814 --> 28:02.681
Can't you just pick it up
off the bottom?

28:02.683 --> 28:05.313
What kind of question is that?

28:05.315 --> 28:07.483
Tell the recovery boats
to remain out at sea

28:07.485 --> 28:09.316
and get those rockets
when they splash down.

28:09.318 --> 28:12.182
Boats can't stay out there
in the wind.

28:12.184 --> 28:13.748
We need you to figure
the cost for your company

28:13.750 --> 28:17.282
if we launch
with no recovery boats.

28:17.284 --> 28:18.347
Oh.

28:19.551 --> 28:21.716
See if NASA
can figure this out, then.

28:21.718 --> 28:23.715
If you want 24 launches
in a year,

28:23.717 --> 28:25.916
you can only do that
with reusable parts.

28:25.918 --> 28:28.447
If the parts get lost
in the Atlantic Ocean...

28:28.449 --> 28:29.882
Wait, too windy?

28:29.884 --> 28:31.882
It's too windy for boats
to be on the water,

28:31.884 --> 28:34.181
but not too windy
to launch the shuttle?

28:34.183 --> 28:35.448
We're trying to get
through this launch

28:35.450 --> 28:37.283
before thinking
about making recoveries

28:37.285 --> 28:38.580
to supply the next one.

28:38.582 --> 28:39.848
If the boats come back in now,

28:39.850 --> 28:42.349
they won't be able to make it
back out for the launch window.

28:42.351 --> 28:44.116
The boats are already
headed back.

28:48.718 --> 28:52.613
So, we're going to lose
a billion-dollar asset?

28:52.615 --> 28:53.715
That's right.

28:53.717 --> 28:54.747
Excuse me?

28:58.916 --> 29:02.180
What's he doing? Huh? Huh?

29:02.182 --> 29:04.180
Get the flight engineer
on the phone now.

29:06.486 --> 29:09.381
This is Adam with the team that
built the Solid Rocket Boosters,

29:09.383 --> 29:10.548
and I have important information

29:10.550 --> 29:13.447
regarding a catastrophic
failure of the shuttle launch

29:13.449 --> 29:14.815
due to the primary
and secondary O-rings.

29:14.817 --> 29:16.816
- Get him on the phone now.
- Who is that on the phone?

29:16.818 --> 29:18.247
Are you talking to Kurt? Huh?

29:20.650 --> 29:22.216
Jim Whitt, go.

29:22.218 --> 29:25.649
Jim, you have about 30 seconds
to get Kurt on the phone

29:25.651 --> 29:27.414
and convince him
to call a meeting

29:27.416 --> 29:28.616
<i>between NASA and our company</i>

29:28.618 --> 29:31.516
<i>to discuss the impending
catastrophic failure</i>

29:31.518 --> 29:33.482
of the primary
and secondary O-rings

29:33.484 --> 29:36.548
due to the cold temperature
of our scheduled launch time.

29:36.550 --> 29:37.881
<i>You better hurry.</i>

29:37.883 --> 29:39.682
You better hold on
because it gets worse.

29:39.684 --> 29:40.748
What do you mean it gets worse?

29:40.750 --> 29:43.481
What could be worse
than a catastrophic failure?

29:43.483 --> 29:45.349
Transfer me over to Kurt.

29:45.351 --> 29:47.481
I don't know how to do that,
the girl that does the phones

29:47.483 --> 29:49.781
is gone for the day.

29:49.783 --> 29:54.482
Just hit transfer, receiver,
then extension 304.

29:54.484 --> 29:55.647
Okay. Here.

29:58.516 --> 29:59.580
Great.

30:04.584 --> 30:05.916
This is how you want
to play this, huh?

30:05.918 --> 30:08.214
- Frank, hold up.
- Like a junior high playground?

30:08.216 --> 30:10.215
Can we all just take a breath
and talk about this?

30:10.217 --> 30:11.415
No!

30:11.417 --> 30:13.550
The time for talking is over.

30:13.552 --> 30:16.682
It looks like I'm gonna to have
to single-handedly save

30:16.684 --> 30:18.617
- the space program.
- Save the space program?

30:18.619 --> 30:20.648
Do you even hear yourself?

30:20.650 --> 30:25.248
What good is a space program
that never launches into space?

30:27.815 --> 30:29.249
<i>Kurt.</i>

30:29.251 --> 30:31.348
<i>We are having some major issues</i>

30:31.350 --> 30:33.184
<i>regarding the launch
tomorrow morning</i>

30:33.186 --> 30:35.417
<i>and we need to set up a meeting
with Marshall,</i>

30:35.419 --> 30:37.282
<i>Kennedy and our company.</i>

30:37.284 --> 30:39.215
Uh, temperature needs
to be discussed

30:39.217 --> 30:41.552
as well as our recovery
of the SRBs.

30:41.554 --> 30:43.382
Boats are being called back in
because of wind,

30:43.384 --> 30:46.116
which puts us in jeopardy
of losing our assets.

30:47.482 --> 30:49.315
That's correct.

30:49.317 --> 30:52.317
Yes, sir, uh, we could use
some management assistance

30:52.319 --> 30:54.949
setting up that meeting ASAP.

30:54.951 --> 30:57.551
And, Kurt,
I want to highly stress

30:57.553 --> 31:00.483
that this remain
an engineering decision.

31:01.816 --> 31:03.582
All right, thank you.

31:23.719 --> 31:25.383
Okay...

31:25.385 --> 31:26.914
Here's what we're gonna do.

31:26.916 --> 31:29.650
We're gonna get a meeting
with Kennedy Space Center

31:29.652 --> 31:33.415
and Marshall Space Flight Center
on a conference call.

31:33.417 --> 31:34.683
We're gonna convince them

31:34.685 --> 31:37.317
to push the launch window
a little bit.

31:37.319 --> 31:40.882
We need those boats out there
and recover our rockets.

31:40.884 --> 31:43.184
Now, what's the argument
with the temperature?

31:43.186 --> 31:44.781
It's inconclusive.

31:45.851 --> 31:49.247
The temperature is outside
of our experience data,

31:49.249 --> 31:51.683
and you that we have been
getting erosion and blowby.

31:51.685 --> 31:54.251
It isn't the worst
at a lower temperature.

31:54.253 --> 31:55.348
Yes, it is.

31:55.350 --> 31:56.849
Not with erosion.

31:56.851 --> 31:58.950
What's the difference,
gentlemen?

31:58.952 --> 32:03.581
Erosion means that the rubber
hose seal is being eaten away.

32:03.583 --> 32:06.348
Blowby is the exhaust that
actually gets past the seals.

32:06.350 --> 32:09.550
And it's the blowby that gets
worse at the lower temperatures.

32:09.552 --> 32:10.751
The lower the temperature,

32:10.753 --> 32:14.916
the more the rocket exhaust
passes right past the seals.

32:14.918 --> 32:15.984
The greater the blowby,

32:15.986 --> 32:18.783
the greater the chance
of secondary seal failure.

32:18.785 --> 32:21.684
Secondary seal failure
equals catastrophic failure.

32:21.686 --> 32:23.482
Okay.

32:23.484 --> 32:27.283
We are going to argue
for a launch delay.

32:27.285 --> 32:30.918
And we are all going to be
in agreement, Frank.

32:30.920 --> 32:33.418
Now NASA is pushing
for a launch,

32:33.420 --> 32:36.583
even though it could cost us
our rockets.

32:36.585 --> 32:38.551
It's the engineering.

32:38.553 --> 32:41.316
We need to push
because of the engineering.

32:41.318 --> 32:45.715
There is more at play here,
Adam, than the engineering.

32:45.717 --> 32:48.850
The danged media
keeps pushing and pushing.

32:48.852 --> 32:52.316
So much so that NASA
is staring down the barrel

32:52.318 --> 32:55.218
of another national
embarrassment.

32:55.220 --> 32:58.417
Especially after the handle
and all the delays.

32:58.419 --> 32:59.650
Who cares?

32:59.652 --> 33:01.351
Who cares?

33:01.353 --> 33:03.182
The people
who pay the bills care.

33:03.184 --> 33:04.749
- The taxpayers.
- Yeah, right.

33:04.751 --> 33:06.852
The Department of Defense
pays the bills,

33:06.854 --> 33:09.450
so their satellites
can catch a ride into orbit.

33:09.452 --> 33:12.485
And the DOD wants
what they paid for.

33:12.487 --> 33:14.783
If they don't get
what they paid for,

33:14.785 --> 33:16.683
they'll just go somewhere else.

33:16.685 --> 33:19.150
Where? Macy's?

33:19.851 --> 33:21.950
Maybe NASA and the DOD

33:21.952 --> 33:24.615
think it's time to invest
in a new horse,

33:24.617 --> 33:29.452
especially if this horse can't
get them where they wanna go.

33:29.454 --> 33:33.319
You think it's an engineering
problem, but it's not.

33:34.453 --> 33:35.815
It's an economic problem.

33:35.817 --> 33:38.218
Are we arguing to launch
or not launch?

33:38.220 --> 33:41.750
Yes, economics is a factor.
I thoroughly agree.

33:41.752 --> 33:43.885
- However, the five of us.
- Five lepers.

33:43.887 --> 33:45.451
The five of us believe

33:45.453 --> 33:47.449
temperature
is the best argument.

33:47.451 --> 33:50.751
If NASA's loss is not greater
than our loss of the rockets,

33:50.753 --> 33:53.416
then the economic argument
will not work.

33:53.418 --> 33:56.752
However, if they are concerned
about the loss of their shuttle

33:56.754 --> 33:59.317
in an even
more embarrassing incident,

33:59.319 --> 34:00.618
then we should argue

34:00.620 --> 34:03.351
in the best interest
of their success.

34:03.353 --> 34:05.784
If we delay a few hours,

34:05.786 --> 34:07.551
temperature goes up,
right, Adam?

34:07.553 --> 34:08.553
Yes.

34:08.554 --> 34:10.886
And the rocket gets launched,
right, Frank?

34:12.318 --> 34:13.452
Yes.

34:13.454 --> 34:17.319
And our ships have a better shot
of recovering our SRBs,

34:17.321 --> 34:18.417
right, Kurt?

34:18.418 --> 34:20.482
Absolutely.

34:20.484 --> 34:22.284
Then it seems to me
we have no other choice

34:22.286 --> 34:23.217
in the matter.

34:23.219 --> 34:25.286
It seems we have no choice
in the matter.

34:25.288 --> 34:29.449
Sir, let us put together
an argument.

34:29.452 --> 34:34.485
We want to help the company,
NASA, the DOD, everyone.

34:42.254 --> 34:46.350
You have exactly 45 minutes
to get a presentation together.

34:46.351 --> 34:47.451
Forty-five minutes?

34:47.453 --> 34:49.482
As soon as this sentence
is done,

34:49.484 --> 34:51.248
I am picking up that phone,

34:51.250 --> 34:53.619
calling them
and setting the meeting.

34:53.621 --> 34:56.617
How are we supposed to get
this prepped in 45 minutes?

34:56.619 --> 34:57.717
Get him outta here.

34:57.719 --> 34:59.418
Kurt, this is a complex
technical issue,

34:59.420 --> 35:01.351
- we need more than 45 minutes.
- Stop.

35:04.220 --> 35:05.350
Mr. Nelson?

35:05.352 --> 35:06.651
<i>How are we supposed
to put together</i>

35:06.653 --> 35:09.285
a complex technical presentation

35:09.287 --> 35:12.551
and send it across America,
so Utah, Alabama and Florida

35:12.553 --> 35:14.817
can all see it all
within 45 measly minutes?

35:14.819 --> 35:15.785
We got the win.

35:15.787 --> 35:18.418
Oh, what was all that
about the economics?

35:18.420 --> 35:20.418
Adam, NASA has never gone

35:20.420 --> 35:22.518
against a contractor's
recommendation.

35:23.319 --> 35:24.485
We get the meeting.

35:24.487 --> 35:25.851
We tell them
we don't want to launch,

35:25.853 --> 35:27.085
they don't negate us, we win.

35:27.087 --> 35:29.685
Let's throw some stuff together
and get the launch delayed,

35:29.687 --> 35:31.318
and get to work on this thing,
you know?

35:31.320 --> 35:33.682
Get it launched eventually,
so we can have jobs.

35:33.684 --> 35:36.751
If we do a halfway decent job,
we will be just fine.

35:36.753 --> 35:38.781
Oh, in 45 minutes?

35:38.783 --> 35:40.617
I'm starting to think
this was a bad idea.

35:40.619 --> 35:42.384
Why don't you just go home
for the night?

35:42.386 --> 35:43.853
No. We need everyone working.

35:43.855 --> 35:45.650
I used to think you only cared
about being right.

35:45.652 --> 35:47.583
- That's right.
- Now I think you only care about

35:47.585 --> 35:49.319
being at odds with everyone.

35:49.321 --> 35:51.616
What you think doesn't matter.

35:51.618 --> 35:54.185
I think what he thinks matters!

35:54.187 --> 35:56.484
What if we are chasing
a ghost here? Huh?

35:56.486 --> 35:57.618
A mad man's imagination.

35:57.620 --> 36:00.519
Why do we have to participate
in this death spiral?

36:00.521 --> 36:01.615
Because I'm the one who's right.

36:01.617 --> 36:04.183
- Yeah, says you.
- That's right, says me.

36:05.221 --> 36:07.417
I'm out.

36:07.419 --> 36:09.286
- Edwin, we need you.
- I don't need this.

36:09.288 --> 36:13.484
Ed, you have to look past
the argument and the number

36:13.486 --> 36:17.387
and the data and the O-rings
and see the man.

36:17.389 --> 36:19.285
All right, sometimes
he doesn't get it.

36:19.287 --> 36:21.718
He doesn't care about you,
he doesn't care about me.

36:21.720 --> 36:24.716
Hell, I don't even think
he cares about the engineering.

36:24.718 --> 36:25.952
But I do know
he cares about this,

36:25.954 --> 36:27.785
he cares about being right.

36:27.787 --> 36:31.219
And that's what I trust
and that's the truth.

36:31.221 --> 36:33.853
You gotta get past
his little show.

36:33.855 --> 36:35.716
- I trust him.
- Yeah, you trust everyone.

36:35.718 --> 36:36.652
I just wish I had another day.

36:36.654 --> 36:38.317
- What if he's wrong?
- What if he's right?

36:38.319 --> 36:39.920
- What if he's wrong?
- What if he's right?

36:39.922 --> 36:42.586
Whoa! Why is this our problem
all of a sudden?

36:42.588 --> 36:46.316
If we're wrong and we stop the
launch for no reason, we lose.

36:46.318 --> 36:48.186
If we're right and we stop
a launch, another launch,

36:48.188 --> 36:49.351
we lose.

36:49.353 --> 36:50.619
It's lose-lose.

36:50.621 --> 36:53.252
Because we are the only people
on the planet

36:53.254 --> 36:54.685
who know we don't know

36:54.687 --> 36:58.551
that there might possibly be,
maybe, a problem.

36:58.553 --> 37:00.218
And it's the right thing
to do.

37:01.254 --> 37:02.685
It is time to move.

37:04.288 --> 37:05.684
We split up.

37:05.686 --> 37:07.487
Five minutes to gather.

37:07.489 --> 37:09.318
Fifteen minutes to sort.

37:09.320 --> 37:10.920
Fifteen minutes to chart.

37:10.922 --> 37:12.452
And fifteen minutes to send off.

37:12.454 --> 37:13.619
That's 50 minutes.

37:13.621 --> 37:15.284
We'll have to move faster
than time.

37:15.286 --> 37:16.687
We'll have to hand draw
our charts.

37:16.689 --> 37:20.651
Agreed. They are gonna want
a lot of statistics,

37:20.653 --> 37:23.584
so if you have any doubt,
just bring everything with you.

37:23.586 --> 37:25.348
How do we make
a presentation to people

37:25.350 --> 37:26.517
in three different parts
of the country

37:26.519 --> 37:28.784
in just under 40 minutes?

37:28.786 --> 37:31.784
It's 1986,
we are rocket scientists,

37:31.786 --> 37:33.418
we work with NASA.

37:33.420 --> 37:34.685
We are going to fax it.

37:43.720 --> 37:44.950
<i>Good evening.</i>

37:44.952 --> 37:47.287
<i>I'm joined tonight
by teacher turned astronaut.</i>

37:47.289 --> 37:50.584
<i>And the first civilian
to ever go into space.</i>

37:50.586 --> 37:52.487
<i>I have to start by asking you,</i>

37:52.489 --> 37:55.252
<i>what do you think
this is gonna mean for you</i>

37:55.254 --> 37:56.585
<i>after the mission?</i>

37:56.587 --> 37:59.516
<i>What are you going to do
when you return from space?</i>

37:59.518 --> 38:00.652
<i>I don't know.</i>

38:00.654 --> 38:02.817
<i>But I do know
that this is an adventure</i>

38:02.819 --> 38:03.853
<i>I couldn't say no to.</i>

38:03.855 --> 38:05.584
<i>I mean, to be able to go
into space</i>

38:05.586 --> 38:07.251
<i>and help school children learn</i>

38:07.253 --> 38:09.352
<i>and be more interested
in learning,</i>

38:09.354 --> 38:11.617
<i>that's what I'm really
looking forward to right now.</i>

38:11.619 --> 38:13.751
<i>At first, I was... I was nervous</i>

38:13.753 --> 38:15.615
<i>about what it would mean
for my family,</i>

38:15.617 --> 38:18.618
<i>and my husband, my kids,
my teaching career,</i>

38:18.620 --> 38:21.516
<i>but now I'm just looking forward
to the adventure ahead.</i>

38:21.518 --> 38:26.252
<i>You know, the great unknown,
not necessarily space, but life.</i>

38:26.254 --> 38:28.653
<i>Do you think it's really sunken
yet, you're going into space?</i>

38:28.655 --> 38:31.220
<i>No, absolutely not.</i>

38:31.222 --> 38:35.885
<i>I still can't believe
that I was chosen for this.</i>

38:35.887 --> 38:37.887
<i>You know, 50,000 people applied.</i>

38:37.889 --> 38:40.687
<i>I still remember putting
my letter into the mailbox,</i>

38:40.689 --> 38:42.886
<i>and thinking,
there are so many other people</i>

38:42.888 --> 38:44.852
<i>doing the exact same thing
right now.</i>

38:44.854 --> 38:46.951
<i>We were all alike that day.</i>

38:46.953 --> 38:50.685
<i>We all thought, "It could be me.
I have a chance at this."</i>

38:50.687 --> 38:52.653
<i>And then it was me and it's like
winning the lottery</i>

38:52.655 --> 38:55.918
<i>to be able to go into space
and blasting off in the shuttle.</i>

38:55.920 --> 38:58.653
<i>I mean, I just feel like
I'm taking everyone here</i>

38:58.655 --> 39:00.420
<i>on earth up there with me.</i>

39:00.422 --> 39:02.154
<i>Are you afraid at all?</i>

39:02.855 --> 39:04.819
<i>No. I don't think so.</i>

39:04.821 --> 39:06.951
<i>Who knows, though,
when we're actually strapped in</i>

39:06.953 --> 39:10.553
<i>and those massive rockets
are blasting us off into space.</i>

39:10.555 --> 39:11.852
<i>Yeah, that does sound
kinda scary.</i>

39:11.854 --> 39:14.919
<i>But I have the utmost confidence
in the thousands of people</i>

39:14.921 --> 39:16.655
<i>who make all of this happen.</i>

39:16.657 --> 39:20.351
<i>You know, these days,
space flight is very safe.</i>

39:20.353 --> 39:21.452
<i>You know, recently,</i>

39:21.454 --> 39:23.418
<i>NASA has had a few delays.</i>

39:23.420 --> 39:27.320
<i>How, if at all, has that
affected the crew, mentally?</i>

39:27.322 --> 39:28.484
<i>I mean, it's definitely,</i>

39:28.486 --> 39:29.685
<i>uh, been interesting.</i>

39:29.687 --> 39:31.785
<i>You get so excited about finally
taking this mission,</i>

39:31.787 --> 39:33.521
<i>and then it's delayed.</i>

39:33.523 --> 39:36.653
<i>But I know that the engineers
and everybody else involved</i>

39:36.655 --> 39:39.620
<i>are doing what they need to do
to make it as safe as possible.</i>

39:39.622 --> 39:41.953
<i>So, I have full confidence
in what they're doing</i>

39:41.955 --> 39:43.686
<i>and the decisions they make.</i>

39:43.688 --> 39:46.753
<i>If it needed to be postponed
then, you know, for our safety</i>

39:46.755 --> 39:50.587
<i>or for whatever reason
they have, then that's something</i>

39:50.589 --> 39:52.486
<i>that I think we're all
okay with.</i>

39:52.488 --> 39:54.253
<i>You know, at some
point in everyone's life,</i>

39:54.255 --> 39:56.189
<i>they dream
of being an astronaut.</i>

39:56.191 --> 39:57.619
<i>And you get to be one.</i>

39:57.621 --> 40:00.787
<i>Are you having fun,
has this been a fun experience?</i>

40:00.789 --> 40:02.684
<i>Oh, yes. So much fun.</i>

40:02.686 --> 40:05.219
<i>I... I love everyone
I work with.</i>

40:05.221 --> 40:09.518
<i>Commander Scobee
is a solid unflappable man.</i>

40:09.520 --> 40:14.484
<i>Uh, Mike and Ellison
are the hardest working,</i>

40:14.486 --> 40:16.385
<i>smartest people
you will ever meet.</i>

40:16.387 --> 40:19.852
<i>And Ron and Greg will...</i>

40:19.854 --> 40:21.751
<i>they make us laugh nonstop.</i>

40:21.753 --> 40:24.320
<i>Judi and I
have a lot of fun together.</i>

40:24.322 --> 40:25.952
<i>And, I mean, just as a team,</i>

40:25.954 --> 40:27.953
<i>we really have to rely
on one other.</i>

40:27.955 --> 40:29.721
<i>Sounds like an amazing team.</i>

40:29.723 --> 40:31.286
<i>Oh, it is. I mean,</i>

40:31.288 --> 40:32.884
<i>all the way from the very top
of NASA</i>

40:32.886 --> 40:37.685
<i>down to the guys who clean
to the engineers in between</i>

40:37.687 --> 40:40.655
<i>who make sure that
this is as safe as possible.</i>

40:40.657 --> 40:43.452
<i>I mean, all these people
involved are what make it</i>

40:43.454 --> 40:44.818
<i>such an amazing experience.</i>

40:44.820 --> 40:46.720
<i>And it's...
I've had so much joy</i>

40:46.722 --> 40:49.353
<i>getting to be a part
of all of this.</i>

40:49.355 --> 40:51.554
<i>I know that all of my students,</i>

40:51.556 --> 40:53.319
<i>and even the students
at the elementary</i>

40:53.321 --> 40:54.687
<i>and the middle school</i>

40:54.689 --> 40:57.187
<i>that, uh, go to my high school,
that feed into my high school</i>

40:57.189 --> 40:58.352
<i>are all going to be watching.</i>

40:58.354 --> 40:59.919
<i>And I'm just so excited
to be there to wave</i>

40:59.921 --> 41:02.319
<i>at the cameras and see them
and, you know,</i>

41:02.321 --> 41:05.320
<i>let them see that your dreams
can come true.</i>

41:05.322 --> 41:07.554
<i>Uh, I mean,
who would've thought that I...</i>

41:07.556 --> 41:10.652
<i>I'm a high school science
teacher who's going into space.</i>

41:59.190 --> 42:02.254
We have no time. Let's go
and get this table out here.

42:05.191 --> 42:06.822
Thank you, sir, appreciate it.

42:10.657 --> 42:12.486
Everything passed,
I need to have them.

42:12.488 --> 42:14.619
What else do we need?
We need all sources.

42:17.455 --> 42:19.188
Come on,
we need the erosion charts

42:19.190 --> 42:21.522
- from STS-51-B.
- That is 51-B.

42:21.524 --> 42:23.719
We need to 51-A and 60...

42:23.721 --> 42:26.288
Oh, I saw that one
in one of the brown folders.

42:26.290 --> 42:27.920
- Which one?
- Oh, uh, one of them.

42:27.922 --> 42:29.188
I'm not sure.

42:29.190 --> 42:31.488
I need all SRM recoveries to go.

42:31.490 --> 42:32.688
Go?

42:32.690 --> 42:34.721
- Go out or go in?
- In.

42:35.923 --> 42:37.787
You need this one?

42:37.789 --> 42:39.552
Mm-hm.

42:39.554 --> 42:42.354
Should we separate the
soot levels from the erosion?

42:42.356 --> 42:45.219
No, I want them to see
the correlation.

42:45.221 --> 42:47.254
Should we make a main summary
of all the findings?

42:47.256 --> 42:48.520
Wait, wait, wait.

42:48.522 --> 42:54.222
We need 51-A, 51, uh, G,
and 51-F.

42:54.224 --> 42:56.219
"I" comes after that.

42:56.221 --> 42:57.420
"I" after "F."

42:57.422 --> 42:59.686
Why can't these be in order
and we call them Challenger

42:59.688 --> 43:01.351
and Discovery
and then the number?

43:01.353 --> 43:03.955
Well, because they didn't all go
in consecutive order.

43:03.957 --> 43:05.287
They're... they're all mixed up.

43:05.289 --> 43:06.421
It would just be
even more confusing.

43:06.423 --> 43:07.785
Right, more confusing.

43:07.787 --> 43:08.886
Does anyone else find it funny

43:08.888 --> 43:13.452
that we use labels 51-L
and 61-A, not the number 13?

43:13.454 --> 43:15.321
- Okay.
- Doesn't make sense to me.

43:15.323 --> 43:16.654
- Yeah, just me, okay.
- I blame it on Apollo.

43:16.656 --> 43:17.822
Okay.

43:17.824 --> 43:20.387
I'm missing another launch
from October.

43:20.389 --> 43:21.920
I've got the 30th.

43:21.922 --> 43:23.221
Eighty-four or eighty-five?

43:23.223 --> 43:24.286
Eighty-five.

43:24.288 --> 43:27.520
Anyone have October
not 30th 1985?

43:27.522 --> 43:28.588
Anyone?

43:28.590 --> 43:29.785
Somebody talk to me.

43:29.787 --> 43:31.555
Adam?

43:31.557 --> 43:33.788
Adam. Get your head in the game.

43:34.823 --> 43:36.352
Adam?

43:36.354 --> 43:38.652
You've never been more wrong
about anything.

43:39.757 --> 43:41.821
I get this more than you know.

43:44.790 --> 43:45.887
Okay.

43:48.489 --> 43:51.453
I'm gonna go get a cup of...

43:54.423 --> 43:58.553
Hey, um, give me a hand
with these drawings, okay?

43:58.555 --> 44:00.586
You know he's our best shot.

44:00.588 --> 44:02.354
- I know.
- We know.

44:02.356 --> 44:04.388
Yeah, well...

44:04.390 --> 44:06.922
he has exactly nine minutes
to get it together.

44:06.924 --> 44:08.187
He better.

44:09.154 --> 44:11.221
As a matter of fact,
all of us need to throw

44:11.223 --> 44:13.321
some cold water on our faces
before we go in there.

44:14.555 --> 44:15.652
Agreed.

44:17.889 --> 44:20.954
<i>When you prepared
for the telecon meeting,</i>

44:20.956 --> 44:22.619
had anything changed
in your plan

44:22.621 --> 44:24.419
to approach your higher-ups?

44:28.223 --> 44:29.286
No.

44:30.191 --> 44:31.187
<i>Hello?</i>

44:32.790 --> 44:33.953
Hey.

44:33.955 --> 44:36.587
Hey. How's it going over there?

44:38.189 --> 44:39.820
Oh, I got what I wanted,

44:39.822 --> 44:42.254
just not the way that I wanted.

44:43.822 --> 44:45.286
Is it the temperature?

44:46.391 --> 44:48.186
<i>Yes.</i>

44:48.188 --> 44:49.720
<i>The fluorocarbon elastomer.</i>

44:49.722 --> 44:51.121
Yes.

44:54.722 --> 44:56.321
You're the only ones.

44:56.323 --> 44:57.553
There's no one else.

45:01.323 --> 45:02.354
Mm-hm.

45:05.290 --> 45:08.887
<i>You have a human problem,
not an engineering problem.</i>

45:14.891 --> 45:16.356
What's next?

45:17.490 --> 45:19.321
What do you have
right in front of you

45:19.323 --> 45:20.753
that you have to do right now?

45:24.222 --> 45:26.387
Stand... stand up and go
in the conference room.

45:27.556 --> 45:28.786
<i>And then what?</i>

45:30.723 --> 45:32.788
Make sure everyone
has the right documents.

45:34.257 --> 45:35.387
Then what?

45:39.290 --> 45:40.756
I'll check the temperature
correlations

45:40.758 --> 45:42.590
to blowby and seal integrity.

45:44.657 --> 45:45.756
Good.

45:45.758 --> 45:47.255
You can do this.

45:55.855 --> 45:56.886
Mary?

46:00.225 --> 46:01.422
<i>I know.</i>

48:22.791 --> 48:23.855
Yeah.

48:41.491 --> 48:43.155
We are all here, gentlemen.

48:44.657 --> 48:45.922
<i>This is Jim,</i>

48:45.924 --> 48:48.686
The Company's flight engineer
here at Kennedy Space Center.

48:48.688 --> 48:50.289
Good evening, gentlemen.

48:50.291 --> 48:52.390
Anyone from Marshall on yet?

48:52.392 --> 48:56.390
Uh, yes. Sid, Rust,
and Pat here.

48:56.392 --> 48:58.656
<i>All right, what seems
to be the issue here?</i>

48:58.658 --> 49:01.455
Our best seal expert Adam

49:01.457 --> 49:04.623
has some concerns
about the temperature.

49:04.625 --> 49:07.657
I can't stress enough
how important it is

49:07.659 --> 49:10.324
that how long it takes
for these O-rings to seal

49:10.326 --> 49:15.356
after they are compressed
is vital to a successful launch.

49:15.358 --> 49:18.356
The bottom line is
the colder it gets,

49:18.358 --> 49:22.225
the further we move away
from the direction of goodness.

49:22.227 --> 49:23.622
What do you mean
we're moving away

49:23.624 --> 49:26.589
from the direction of goodness?

49:26.591 --> 49:29.589
The ability for the seals
to expand in their grooves

49:29.591 --> 49:32.590
is reduced as a function
of temperature,

49:32.592 --> 49:36.688
that's when the exhaust blows
right by the gap created,

49:36.690 --> 49:40.756
burns a hole in the side,
and explodes.

49:40.758 --> 49:42.689
You have a history of seal
and erosion

49:42.691 --> 49:45.354
and blowby correlation
from previous relevant launches.

49:45.356 --> 49:47.387
Pages nine through twenty.

49:49.726 --> 49:52.891
Yes, there are... there... there
are two seals on each joint.

49:52.893 --> 49:56.755
Now, we have seen the primary
seal breached in the past.

49:56.757 --> 49:58.190
And we have all discussed

49:58.192 --> 50:00.490
the primary seal
being compromised,

50:01.857 --> 50:03.758
and we have all concluded

50:03.760 --> 50:06.458
that this is an acceptable level
of failure

50:06.460 --> 50:10.389
if we are confident
the second seal will hold.

50:10.391 --> 50:14.388
We are unsure the secondary seal
will hold at these temperatures.

50:16.426 --> 50:19.355
<i>So, you don't know?</i>

50:21.725 --> 50:23.792
We know that we don't know.

50:23.794 --> 50:26.690
Never has a contractor
spoken more truly.

50:26.692 --> 50:28.191
Well, thank you, Marshall.

50:28.193 --> 50:30.590
We try to keep a handle
on things,

50:30.592 --> 50:33.690
though not as good as you guys.

50:33.692 --> 50:35.489
<i>We have enough time
to make jokes,</i>

50:35.491 --> 50:37.557
but we don't have enough time
to fix seals.

50:37.559 --> 50:40.593
If the seals are a problem,
then why aren't they

50:40.595 --> 50:44.290
in the problem assessment system
documents we have here?

50:44.292 --> 50:47.256
And why are we just hearing
about it now, tonight?

50:47.258 --> 50:49.589
Yeah, I'm gonna let our
problem assessment expert

50:49.591 --> 50:51.393
handle that one.

50:51.395 --> 50:52.558
Frank?

50:54.293 --> 51:00.590
Uh, because it looks
to be like that

51:00.592 --> 51:03.191
we left them off
of the document.

51:03.892 --> 51:05.423
Because it was fixed?

51:06.193 --> 51:07.425
No, sir.

51:07.427 --> 51:09.358
Because they were always
on there.

51:10.492 --> 51:12.390
I don't understand.

51:12.392 --> 51:14.292
<i>So you're saying
we took a problem</i>

51:14.294 --> 51:16.659
of the problem assessment system

51:16.661 --> 51:18.891
because it's still a problem?

51:18.893 --> 51:24.357
We all agreed
that these ongoing problems

51:24.359 --> 51:28.789
were cluttering up the PASes,
no one was looking at them.

51:28.791 --> 51:31.321
And the things that we took off

51:31.323 --> 51:34.490
were to be handled
by a special committee.

51:34.492 --> 51:37.388
Uh, seems like,
what's the main seal guy's name?

51:37.390 --> 51:38.356
<i>Adam.</i>

51:38.358 --> 51:41.725
Seems like Adam thinks
the problem isn't fixed.

51:41.727 --> 51:43.790
We all agreed
the problem is acceptable.

51:43.792 --> 51:46.690
We've never launched a shuttle
below 53 Degrees

51:46.692 --> 51:48.821
and we're moving
into the coldest launch

51:48.823 --> 51:50.623
in NASA's history.

51:50.625 --> 51:53.622
So you're changing
the launch criteria

51:53.624 --> 51:59.222
from 40 degrees to 53 degrees
the night before the launch?

51:59.224 --> 52:02.189
We're saying
this is our data limitation.

52:02.191 --> 52:04.692
When we run tests
and squeeze the rubber...

52:04.694 --> 52:06.957
Look at page 38.

52:06.959 --> 52:09.324
When we squeeze it
at 100 degrees,

52:09.326 --> 52:12.424
and then let off the pressure
we never lose contact,

52:12.426 --> 52:15.293
but at 50 degrees
when we let off the pressure,

52:15.295 --> 52:16.557
it takes a few minutes

52:16.559 --> 52:19.324
for the rubber
to spring back into place.

52:19.326 --> 52:21.525
<i>Your test does not
represent reality.</i>

52:21.527 --> 52:24.224
<i>The O-rings are constantly
under pressure,</i>

52:24.226 --> 52:26.492
your conclusion is not logical.

52:26.494 --> 52:28.256
It is logical.

52:28.258 --> 52:30.691
It proves that the fluorocarbon
elastomer rubber

52:30.693 --> 52:33.223
is absolutely affected
by temperature.

52:33.225 --> 52:35.756
If we lose the seal
for a tenth of a second,

52:35.758 --> 52:38.589
the hot fire and gases
could blowby the seal

52:38.591 --> 52:41.490
and erode the O-ring,
which we have seen happen.

52:41.492 --> 52:44.556
And if the secondary backup
O-ring does the same thing,

52:44.558 --> 52:45.688
is compromised...

52:47.192 --> 52:48.958
that's the ball game.

52:48.960 --> 52:52.524
We've seen blowby
on STS-61-A also.

52:52.526 --> 52:54.760
It's page four.

52:54.762 --> 52:58.624
It says here that the launch
went off at 75 degrees

52:58.626 --> 53:00.392
and you got blowby.

53:00.394 --> 53:01.856
I just don't understand

53:01.858 --> 53:03.690
how you can determine
temperature

53:03.692 --> 53:05.425
<i>is the deciding factor.</i>

53:05.427 --> 53:08.491
Yeah, I'd like to answer
that one please.

53:08.493 --> 53:10.958
I just don't understand
how you don't understand

53:10.960 --> 53:14.224
that the cold makes rubber
harder and less flexible.

53:14.226 --> 53:18.658
It's warm, there's blowby.
It's cold, there's blowby.

53:18.660 --> 53:20.925
<i>It's warm, there's erosion.</i>

53:20.927 --> 53:23.289
<i>It's cold, there's erosion.</i>

53:23.291 --> 53:26.925
It doesn't seem to matter
what temperature it is.

53:26.927 --> 53:29.591
Yeah, if you'll just look at it
with a rudimentary pass-fail,

53:29.593 --> 53:31.924
then, yes,
they both get blowby.

53:31.926 --> 53:34.393
But if you get scientific
about it,

53:34.395 --> 53:35.924
at the colder temperatures,

53:35.926 --> 53:38.725
the soot from the blowby
is jet-black.

53:38.727 --> 53:43.191
At 75 degrees, the soot from the
blowby is light gray, spotty.

53:43.193 --> 53:44.526
I examined them myself.

53:44.528 --> 53:45.923
Now, if you can't see
the difference,

53:45.925 --> 53:47.159
<i>I can't help you.</i>

53:47.161 --> 53:50.892
<i>We have seen primary
seal failure in the past.</i>

53:50.894 --> 53:53.359
And if you see
primary seal failure,

53:53.361 --> 53:56.594
then there is a high probability
of secondary seal failure

53:56.596 --> 53:58.524
within the first second
of ignition

53:58.526 --> 54:00.926
when the rocket flexes
at the joint.

54:00.928 --> 54:02.890
And it will flex.

54:02.892 --> 54:05.825
And when the seals
are compromised, you get blowby.

54:05.827 --> 54:07.894
The blowby erodes the seals.

54:07.896 --> 54:09.825
And that's when you have
rocket flames

54:09.827 --> 54:12.325
shooting out the side
instead of the bottom.

54:12.327 --> 54:16.424
And you have never seen
secondary backup seal failure?

54:16.426 --> 54:18.225
Actually, we have.

54:18.227 --> 54:24.459
STS-51-B, the secondary O-ring
suffered 12% erosion.

54:24.461 --> 54:26.491
So why wasn't that
the ball game, Bill?

54:26.493 --> 54:27.690
<i>What do you mean?</i>

54:27.692 --> 54:29.326
Well, you said earlier,

54:29.328 --> 54:31.456
that if we have secondary
seal failure,

54:31.458 --> 54:33.456
it would be the ball game.

54:33.458 --> 54:35.425
This says it's happened before.

54:35.427 --> 54:36.956
Just because we done it once

54:36.958 --> 54:38.257
doesn't mean
we could do it again.

54:38.259 --> 54:39.624
We did it by the skin
of our teeth.

54:39.626 --> 54:41.957
Is this how we're going
to keep going?

54:41.959 --> 54:44.258
Like a child who runs out
into the road

54:44.260 --> 54:45.524
and nothing happens.

54:45.526 --> 54:46.526
He says, "See, I'm just fine.

54:46.528 --> 54:48.557
Let's just keep on running out
into the road."

54:48.559 --> 54:50.191
And the parents do nothing?

54:50.193 --> 54:51.293
Oh.

54:51.295 --> 54:52.460
So you're the parent?

54:52.462 --> 54:53.657
Someone has to be.

54:53.659 --> 54:55.925
I just can't believe that
it's a function of temperature.

54:55.927 --> 54:57.860
The data is inconclusive.

54:57.862 --> 55:00.958
I can't accept
this train of thought.

55:00.960 --> 55:02.659
If you take a look
at the synopsis,

55:02.661 --> 55:04.724
we should not launch
with an O-ring temperature

55:04.726 --> 55:07.191
below 53 degrees Fahrenheit.

55:07.193 --> 55:09.560
It shouldn't matter that we've
skirted disaster in the past.

55:09.562 --> 55:11.892
The odds will catch
with us eventually.

55:11.894 --> 55:14.158
<i>Quantify your results.</i>

55:16.861 --> 55:18.458
Quantify?

55:18.460 --> 55:21.290
What is the probability
of primary

55:21.292 --> 55:23.757
and secondary O-ring failure?

55:23.759 --> 55:25.960
I don't understand
your question.

55:25.962 --> 55:27.724
<i>Quantify!</i>

55:27.726 --> 55:30.825
How do you quantify
a train is coming?

55:30.827 --> 55:33.892
You look down the tracks
and you see a train is coming.

55:33.894 --> 55:37.957
I am telling you to do it.
Quantify your results!

55:37.959 --> 55:40.692
No, I can't.
I can't do that with this data!

55:40.694 --> 55:43.723
I can only work with the data
in front of me.

55:43.725 --> 55:45.792
You're giving me oranges

55:45.794 --> 55:47.859
and asking me to bake you
an apple pie.

55:47.861 --> 55:49.658
I can't do that.

55:49.660 --> 55:53.693
What I can quantify
with 100% accuracy

55:53.695 --> 55:55.624
is that right now
we are moving away

55:55.626 --> 55:57.925
from the direction of goodness.

55:57.927 --> 56:01.458
I don't... I don't understand
this conversation. I...

56:01.460 --> 56:04.560
The facts don't lie!

56:04.562 --> 56:06.591
I don't understand
how you can see the facts

56:06.593 --> 56:08.393
and they don't convince you.

56:08.395 --> 56:10.526
Cold rubber doesn't lie.

56:10.528 --> 56:12.692
Recovered rockets don't lie.

56:12.694 --> 56:15.859
Burned up,
charred up O-rings don't lie.

56:17.626 --> 56:19.561
I'm right about this.

56:19.563 --> 56:20.626
I am.

56:22.329 --> 56:26.326
You hired me to do a job,
and by God, I'm gonna do it.

56:26.328 --> 56:31.926
And I don't care if it ruins me,
or you, or NASA

56:31.928 --> 56:34.260
or anybody else, you get me?

56:38.562 --> 56:39.726
<i>So what do you think, Pat?</i>

56:41.195 --> 56:42.625
I am appalled
that you would dare

56:42.627 --> 56:44.527
to make such a recommendation.

56:44.529 --> 56:48.393
And change the flight criteria
the night before a launch?

56:49.462 --> 56:50.427
Look here,

56:50.429 --> 56:54.560
it is expected to be
29-39 degrees tomorrow.

56:54.562 --> 56:56.492
Even your high temperature

56:56.494 --> 56:58.457
is outside
of our data experience.

56:59.562 --> 57:01.559
Haven't you been
getting ice already?

57:04.263 --> 57:05.326
Fine.

57:05.328 --> 57:07.726
I'm not gonna go against
a contractor's assessment.

57:10.761 --> 57:14.391
When do you want me to launch?
Next April?

57:20.695 --> 57:23.626
<i>I can't go against
a contractor's recommendation</i>

57:23.628 --> 57:24.659
<i>to stop the launch.</i>

57:32.928 --> 57:34.125
Pat?

57:35.893 --> 57:37.157
Jim?

57:38.393 --> 57:40.727
This has to be
an engineering decision,

57:40.729 --> 57:42.695
not program or management.

57:44.228 --> 57:46.791
Kurt? You wanna give us a final?

57:46.793 --> 57:49.890
Uh, can you give us
about five minutes, please?

57:50.962 --> 57:52.225
<i>Yes. You bet.</i>

57:52.227 --> 57:53.357
Thank you.

57:54.796 --> 57:58.424
This is so backwards.

57:58.426 --> 58:01.859
Generating new launch criteria
the night before you launch,

58:01.861 --> 58:03.958
that's backwards.

58:03.960 --> 58:07.226
I suspect our guys
are gathering more data,

58:07.228 --> 58:08.262
running numbers to come up

58:08.264 --> 58:10.760
with a more accurate
temperature launch window.

58:12.827 --> 58:15.459
Whatever they're doing,
they had better come back

58:15.461 --> 58:17.758
with a way to quantify
their recommendation.

58:23.194 --> 58:24.294
What was that?

58:24.296 --> 58:26.893
So now we have to prove
that something doesn't work?

58:26.895 --> 58:29.193
Instead of having to prove
that it does work?

58:39.696 --> 58:41.627
We need to make
a management decision.

58:41.629 --> 58:43.193
We can't do that.

58:45.528 --> 58:48.524
Please, look at the chart
in front of you.

58:50.229 --> 58:51.793
If Bill...
if it tell say nothing,

58:51.795 --> 58:54.893
let them show you
our uncertainty.

58:54.895 --> 58:57.792
We cannot guarantee a good seal!

59:02.495 --> 59:03.793
I don't know what else to say.

59:08.195 --> 59:09.692
Black soot. Look at 'em.

59:10.727 --> 59:11.959
Look at 'em!

59:11.961 --> 59:14.895
Data is inconclusive.

59:14.897 --> 59:17.560
I wouldn't get
on that shuttle tomorrow.

59:17.562 --> 59:19.726
You're not an astronaut.

59:19.728 --> 59:21.759
That's right.
I'm not an astronaut.

59:21.761 --> 59:23.891
But their lives
are in our hands.

59:25.196 --> 59:26.930
Would you get on that shuttle?

59:26.932 --> 59:28.327
They know the risks.

59:28.329 --> 59:30.227
And that's not our concern.

59:31.362 --> 59:32.392
What?

59:34.829 --> 59:37.595
- What kind of a man are you?
- Adam!

59:37.597 --> 59:40.962
Who... How dare you play
with human life like that?

59:40.964 --> 59:44.326
Who do you think you are?
God? Huh?

59:44.328 --> 59:47.658
You think you get to decide
who lives and who dies?

59:50.428 --> 59:53.528
This is despicable
is what this is.

59:53.530 --> 59:56.427
You're a weak,
spineless man, who can't...

59:56.429 --> 01:00:01.825
won't give these poor souls
a chance, so... so what?

01:00:01.827 --> 01:00:03.926
So we can keep our stupid jobs?

01:00:03.928 --> 01:00:08.393
And make an extra buck or two?
Huh?

01:00:08.395 --> 01:00:11.194
You're willing to drive right up
to the edge of the cliff,

01:00:11.196 --> 01:00:14.493
just to see how close
you can get without falling off.

01:00:14.495 --> 01:00:16.494
You're gonna fall off tomorrow.

01:00:18.261 --> 01:00:20.561
I tell you what,
why don't you put on

01:00:20.563 --> 01:00:22.594
one of those pretty
blue costumes and a helmet,

01:00:22.596 --> 01:00:24.393
drive yourself down to that cage

01:00:24.395 --> 01:00:26.358
with a bomb strapped under it,
huh?

01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:29.959
Better yet, why don't you invite
your wife or your daughter?

01:00:29.961 --> 01:00:33.158
This is not a management
decision.

01:01:05.495 --> 01:01:07.828
NASA, we took a second look
at our data,

01:01:07.830 --> 01:01:09.728
and we've determined
that it is inconclusive.

01:01:10.797 --> 01:01:12.294
Our recommendation is to launch.

01:01:14.460 --> 01:01:16.360
<i>Are there any disagreements?</i>

01:01:18.398 --> 01:01:19.461
<i>Then it's a go.</i>

01:01:24.197 --> 01:01:25.827
<i>Why didn't you speak up
after that?</i>

01:01:27.698 --> 01:01:29.161
Why did you stay silent?

01:01:31.395 --> 01:01:33.160
You guys were the engineers.

01:01:33.930 --> 01:01:35.560
You should have said something.

01:01:38.564 --> 01:01:39.862
I don't know
what to say to that.

01:01:42.829 --> 01:01:47.492
That's exactly why you need
our help, to get through this.

01:01:47.494 --> 01:01:49.259
These questions
are gonna come up.

01:01:51.298 --> 01:01:52.497
You need to have an answer.

01:01:52.499 --> 01:01:56.428
Can you fax over a flight
recommendation to get signed?

01:01:56.430 --> 01:01:57.930
Right away.

01:02:10.795 --> 01:02:13.427
Please sign this.

01:02:13.429 --> 01:02:15.526
Oh, no.

01:02:15.528 --> 01:02:19.428
We need someone
from your company to sign this.

01:02:19.430 --> 01:02:20.760
I'm not signing that.

01:02:27.897 --> 01:02:30.195
Can we have someone
from your end

01:02:30.197 --> 01:02:35.562
sign a flight recommendation
and fax it over, please?

01:02:37.299 --> 01:02:38.295
<i>Right away.</i>

01:02:43.461 --> 01:02:45.562
The recovery boats
coming back in

01:02:45.564 --> 01:02:47.194
was enough to scrap the launch.

01:02:47.196 --> 01:02:48.863
The wind was enough
to scrap the launch.

01:02:48.865 --> 01:02:50.862
The ice was enough
to scrap the launch.

01:02:50.864 --> 01:02:53.629
Let alone your contractor
safety concerns.

01:03:04.697 --> 01:03:06.526
If something happens tomorrow,

01:03:06.528 --> 01:03:08.562
I wouldn't want to be the one
to stand up in front

01:03:08.564 --> 01:03:10.896
of some board of inquisition
and give testimony

01:03:10.898 --> 01:03:14.527
as to why I chose to launch
against the qualifications

01:03:14.529 --> 01:03:17.228
and recommendations
of my engineers.

01:05:51.631 --> 01:05:53.263
<i>The T-minus ten seconds</i>

01:05:53.265 --> 01:05:56.296
<i>to burn off any residual
hydrogen gas.</i>

01:05:56.298 --> 01:05:59.230
<i>T-minus 45 seconds and counting.</i>

01:05:59.232 --> 01:06:02.328
<i>The Solid Rocket Booster
flight instrumentation reporters</i>

01:06:02.330 --> 01:06:04.262
<i>have gone into the record mode.</i>

01:06:07.398 --> 01:06:10.960
<i>Coming up on the 32nd point
in our countdown.</i>

01:06:10.962 --> 01:06:14.363
<i>The SRB hydraulic power
units have started.</i>

01:06:14.365 --> 01:06:15.897
<i>T-minus 21 seconds.</i>

01:06:15.899 --> 01:06:19.697
<i>And the Solid Rocket Booster
engine gimbal is now underway.</i>

01:06:20.966 --> 01:06:22.830
<i>T-minus 15 seconds.</i>

01:06:25.497 --> 01:06:27.398
<i>T-minus ten.</i>

01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:30.895
<i>Nine, eight, seven, six...</i>

01:06:30.897 --> 01:06:32.864
<i>We have main engine start.</i>

01:06:32.866 --> 01:06:36.728
<i>...four, three, two, one.</i>

01:06:36.730 --> 01:06:38.399
<i>And lift off.</i>

01:06:38.401 --> 01:06:41.629
<i>Lift of from the 25th
space shuttle mission</i>

01:06:41.631 --> 01:06:43.195
<i>and it has cleared the tower.</i>

01:06:54.533 --> 01:06:56.397
<i>Challenger now
heading down range.</i>

01:07:04.666 --> 01:07:08.697
<i>Engine's beginning throttling
now at 94 percent.</i>

01:07:08.699 --> 01:07:11.896
<i>Normal throttle, uh,
most applied 104 percent.</i>

01:07:14.299 --> 01:07:17.462
<i>It will travel down to, uh,
65 percent, shortly.</i>

01:07:20.964 --> 01:07:22.464
<i>Engine's at 65 percent.</i>

01:07:22.466 --> 01:07:24.261
<i>Three engines
are running normally.</i>

01:07:24.263 --> 01:07:25.397
<i>Three good fuel cells.</i>

01:07:25.399 --> 01:07:26.597
<i>Three good engines.</i>

01:07:27.532 --> 01:07:28.532
<i>Engines throttling up.</i>

01:07:28.534 --> 01:07:30.463
<i>Three engines now
at 104 percent.</i>

01:07:30.465 --> 01:07:32.530
<i>Challenger, go and throttle up.</i>

01:07:32.532 --> 01:07:33.729
<i>Challenger's gonna throttle up.</i>

01:07:38.732 --> 01:07:39.966
<i>One minute, fifteen seconds.</i>

01:07:39.968 --> 01:07:41.696
<i>Velocity, 2900 feet per second.</i>

01:07:41.698 --> 01:07:42.864
<i>An altitude,
nine nautical miles.</i>

01:07:42.866 --> 01:07:44.763
<i>Generates distance,
seven nautical miles.</i>

01:08:08.564 --> 01:08:10.897
Did you know the investigation
turned up the fact

01:08:10.899 --> 01:08:13.966
that some of them
survived the initial explosion?

01:08:18.868 --> 01:08:22.298
Some of the safety switch
protocols had been activated.

01:08:38.698 --> 01:08:41.865
Did they die on impact?
Did they drown?

01:08:41.867 --> 01:08:43.264
Did they suffocate?

01:09:00.363 --> 01:09:02.296
I guess it doesn't matter.

01:09:04.830 --> 01:09:06.426
Did you know any of them?

01:09:10.298 --> 01:09:11.328
No.

01:09:13.798 --> 01:09:15.296
<i>Never met a single one.</i>

01:09:19.532 --> 01:09:22.729
<i>This is a tragedy.</i>

01:09:22.732 --> 01:09:27.832
A true tragedy, one our nation
will not soon forget.

01:09:30.399 --> 01:09:33.830
But I think we have to remember,
it's a risky business.

01:09:34.733 --> 01:09:35.763
It is.

01:09:36.934 --> 01:09:37.932
But you know what?

01:09:37.934 --> 01:09:41.731
I'm really gettin' kinda sick
of hearing that.

01:09:41.733 --> 01:09:45.298
Least we had Reagan
to comfort us, though, huh?

01:09:45.300 --> 01:09:48.499
<i>Today is a day
of mourning and remembering.</i>

01:09:48.501 --> 01:09:49.862
<i>We know we share this pain</i>

01:09:49.863 --> 01:09:52.464
<i>with all of the people
of our country.</i>

01:09:52.466 --> 01:09:55.529
<i>This is truly a national loss.</i>

01:09:55.531 --> 01:09:57.764
<i>To the families of the seven,</i>

01:09:57.766 --> 01:10:01.330
<i>we cannot bear as you do
the full impact of this tragedy.</i>

01:10:02.267 --> 01:10:03.398
<i>But we feel the loss</i>

01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:06.764
<i>and we're thinking
about you so very much.</i>

01:10:06.766 --> 01:10:08.731
<i>I've always had great faith in</i>

01:10:08.733 --> 01:10:10.933
<i>and respect
for our space program.</i>

01:10:10.935 --> 01:10:14.199
<i>And what happened today
does nothing to diminish it.</i>

01:10:14.201 --> 01:10:16.199
<i>We don't hide our space program,</i>

01:10:16.201 --> 01:10:18.765
<i>we don't keep secrets
and cover things up.</i>

01:10:18.767 --> 01:10:21.632
<i>We do it all upfront
and in public.</i>

01:10:21.634 --> 01:10:23.230
<i>That's the way freedom is</i>

01:10:23.232 --> 01:10:25.730
<i>and we wouldn't change it
for a minute.</i>

01:10:25.732 --> 01:10:28.301
<i>We'll continue
our quest in space.</i>

01:10:28.303 --> 01:10:29.697
<i>There would be
more shuttle flights</i>

01:10:29.699 --> 01:10:31.498
<i>and more shuttle crews.</i>

01:10:31.500 --> 01:10:33.967
<i>And, yes, more volunteers,
more civilians,</i>

01:10:33.969 --> 01:10:36.531
<i>more teachers in space.</i>

01:10:36.533 --> 01:10:37.763
<i>Nothing ends here.</i>

01:10:38.968 --> 01:10:40.598
<i>We will never forget them,</i>

01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:43.831
<i>nor the last time we saw them,
this morning.</i>

01:10:43.833 --> 01:10:45.496
<i>As they prepared
for their journey</i>

01:10:45.498 --> 01:10:47.464
<i>and waved goodbye,</i>

01:10:47.466 --> 01:10:51.230
<i>and "slipped
the slurry bonds of Earth"</i>

01:10:51.232 --> 01:10:52.629
<i>to "touch the face of God."</i>

01:10:53.933 --> 01:10:55.163
Thank you.

01:11:16.267 --> 01:11:17.865
What are you doing?

01:11:17.867 --> 01:11:18.963
Getting rid of this thing.

01:11:18.965 --> 01:11:20.731
Why?

01:11:20.733 --> 01:11:23.432
Adam, can you just wait
just one second?

01:11:23.434 --> 01:11:25.530
Adam, what do you think
this is going to solve?

01:11:25.532 --> 01:11:26.665
I don't know.

01:11:26.667 --> 01:11:28.464
You don't have to throw away
our TV.

01:11:28.466 --> 01:11:30.362
Mary, I don't want
all of this getting in.

01:11:30.364 --> 01:11:31.363
Getting in? What are talking...

01:11:31.365 --> 01:11:33.363
The reports, the
investigations, the accusations.

01:11:33.365 --> 01:11:34.464
Haven't you heard
what he was saying?

01:11:34.466 --> 01:11:36.196
Against me. Against us.

01:11:36.198 --> 01:11:37.828
You didn't do anything.

01:11:45.967 --> 01:11:47.164
Hey.

01:11:47.832 --> 01:11:49.230
You did something.

01:11:50.834 --> 01:11:52.365
That amounted to nothing.

01:11:53.967 --> 01:11:55.630
You didn't do anything wrong.

01:12:00.668 --> 01:12:02.199
What?

01:12:02.201 --> 01:12:03.696
You did the right thing.

01:12:03.698 --> 01:12:05.399
I did the right thing?

01:12:05.401 --> 01:12:07.699
This is where you end up
when you do the right thing.

01:12:07.701 --> 01:12:09.730
Right out here in the alley,
right next to the trash

01:12:09.732 --> 01:12:11.832
where the... where the neighbors
can look at you

01:12:11.834 --> 01:12:14.433
and gawk, "Oh, there he is,
there's the engineer,

01:12:14.435 --> 01:12:16.199
that's the guy
that works for the O-rings,

01:12:16.201 --> 01:12:18.699
killed seven people," Mary.

01:12:18.701 --> 01:12:19.834
So, yeah, this spot right here,

01:12:19.836 --> 01:12:22.234
this is where you end up
when you do the right thing.

01:12:23.433 --> 01:12:25.497
You didn't do anything wrong.

01:12:26.632 --> 01:12:28.232
I could've...

01:12:28.234 --> 01:12:29.866
I could've done so much more.

01:12:29.868 --> 01:12:31.729
No. No. You couldn't have.

01:12:31.731 --> 01:12:33.799
You did everything
that you could have.

01:12:33.801 --> 01:12:35.631
- No!
- All of you did.

01:12:35.633 --> 01:12:38.532
Well, did I, uh,
did I call the media?

01:12:38.534 --> 01:12:40.198
Did... did I call
the astronauts?

01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:41.832
Did I try to call
the astronaut's families?

01:12:41.834 --> 01:12:45.632
Did I pick up the red phone
and try to call the president?

01:12:45.634 --> 01:12:46.866
Did I jump in my car

01:12:46.868 --> 01:12:49.198
and go flying all the way down
to Florida

01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:51.234
and go lay down
in the middle of the launch pad

01:12:51.236 --> 01:12:54.565
to try to stop this thing
that I knew was gonna happen?

01:12:54.567 --> 01:12:56.800
I know. I know you knew it.

01:12:56.802 --> 01:12:58.199
But it wouldn't have
changed anything

01:12:58.201 --> 01:12:59.565
because they didn't listen.

01:13:00.933 --> 01:13:02.267
They didn't listen.

01:13:02.269 --> 01:13:04.534
They should have pushed
the launch...

01:13:06.466 --> 01:13:08.197
They should have pushed
the launch.

01:13:09.635 --> 01:13:13.266
They should've pushed it
a few hours, a few weeks, days,

01:13:13.268 --> 01:13:14.333
whatever it took.

01:13:15.269 --> 01:13:16.531
But they didn't.

01:13:16.533 --> 01:13:18.297
And that is on them.

01:13:20.534 --> 01:13:22.332
You were right.

01:13:27.204 --> 01:13:28.400
I was right.

01:13:31.635 --> 01:13:32.632
I was right.

01:13:35.334 --> 01:13:36.364
So what?

01:13:39.668 --> 01:13:44.532
We... This is too heavy
a burden to carry.

01:13:46.936 --> 01:13:50.464
This is what you need to be
throwing away, not the TV.

01:13:50.466 --> 01:13:54.467
Mary, I wasn't the right man
for the job.

01:13:54.469 --> 01:13:56.399
But that's not how this works.

01:14:07.966 --> 01:14:09.732
You can throw it away,

01:14:09.734 --> 01:14:11.500
but it's not gonna
change anything.

01:14:17.636 --> 01:14:19.532
Maybe not,

01:14:19.534 --> 01:14:21.866
but you get to decide
where you go from here.

01:14:44.268 --> 01:14:47.399
What happened in Utah
a few weeks after?

01:14:47.401 --> 01:14:49.933
I don't know.
People were upset.

01:14:49.935 --> 01:14:52.499
Uh, the whole town
has a stake in this.

01:14:52.501 --> 01:14:54.465
Most of us who live here,
work there.

01:14:55.902 --> 01:15:00.632
There were a few individuals
who decided to pull

01:15:00.634 --> 01:15:04.400
a very insensitive stunt,
we don't know who they were.

01:15:04.402 --> 01:15:07.133
Did you feel like
it was directed at you?

01:15:08.667 --> 01:15:10.431
Yeah, I did.

01:16:15.704 --> 01:16:16.901
Hey. Hey.

01:16:20.503 --> 01:16:22.899
Does anybody call you names
because of what happened?

01:16:22.901 --> 01:16:24.232
Some of them.

01:16:25.770 --> 01:16:26.834
Yeah.

01:16:28.835 --> 01:16:31.467
I am so sorry
that this is happening to you.

01:16:32.834 --> 01:16:35.265
Can we just leave now
and never come back?

01:16:37.771 --> 01:16:38.801
No.

01:16:40.636 --> 01:16:42.936
No, something wrong
has been done,

01:16:42.938 --> 01:16:46.435
and your dad
has to see it through, okay?

01:16:46.437 --> 01:16:47.466
Why?

01:16:52.269 --> 01:16:53.632
I'm not sure why.

01:16:56.502 --> 01:16:57.832
And I'm not sure it matters.

01:16:59.403 --> 01:17:00.867
I don't wanna go
to school today.

01:17:01.667 --> 01:17:05.268
Oh. Come here.

01:17:05.270 --> 01:17:08.700
You don't have to, kiddo,
you don't have to.

01:17:10.203 --> 01:17:11.900
But you are gonna have
to go back.

01:17:14.236 --> 01:17:15.833
And when you do,
it's gonna be hard.

01:17:17.467 --> 01:17:18.667
I want you
to remember something,

01:17:18.669 --> 01:17:20.566
and you remember this always...

01:17:23.401 --> 01:17:25.933
your dad tried to stop
that launch

01:17:25.935 --> 01:17:27.765
when no one else would.

01:17:29.768 --> 01:17:31.201
That's the truth.

01:17:41.336 --> 01:17:44.701
They will eventually call anyone
and everyone

01:17:44.703 --> 01:17:45.799
who has a significant role

01:17:45.801 --> 01:17:48.633
in the Solid Rocket Booster
fabrication to testify

01:17:48.635 --> 01:17:51.466
before the commission of
President Reagan has assembled.

01:17:52.569 --> 01:17:53.701
It's a witch hunt.

01:17:53.703 --> 01:17:54.934
It's not a witch hunt.

01:17:54.936 --> 01:17:57.867
It's just
a Fact-Finding Committee.

01:17:57.869 --> 01:18:00.832
Well, they've found an awful lot
of facts lately, haven't they?

01:18:01.804 --> 01:18:03.734
Like what?

01:18:03.736 --> 01:18:06.434
Like that <i>New York Times</i>
article,

01:18:06.436 --> 01:18:09.568
where an insider
leaked sensitive information.

01:18:09.570 --> 01:18:12.969
It's not sensitive information,
it's the truth.

01:18:12.971 --> 01:18:14.833
And if you're implying
that I'm the one who leaked,

01:18:14.835 --> 01:18:16.203
you're out of your mind.

01:18:16.205 --> 01:18:18.569
Do not give out
any more information

01:18:18.571 --> 01:18:20.935
than is absolutely necessary.

01:18:20.937 --> 01:18:24.203
Yes, no, or I don't know.

01:18:24.205 --> 01:18:26.302
You shouldn't antagonize
these people.

01:18:26.304 --> 01:18:28.768
Don't go out there on your own.

01:18:28.770 --> 01:18:30.566
I'm telling you,
for your own sake.

01:18:30.568 --> 01:18:33.633
I don't like the way
you said that.

01:18:33.635 --> 01:18:35.669
Do you want the space program
to continue.

01:18:35.671 --> 01:18:37.802
- Yes or no?
- That's not the question.

01:18:37.804 --> 01:18:40.402
Yes or no?

01:18:40.404 --> 01:18:44.634
That is the question.
That is the only question.

01:18:44.636 --> 01:18:46.469
You engineers seem to think
that in few weeks,

01:18:46.471 --> 01:18:47.767
it's business as usual.

01:18:47.769 --> 01:18:49.535
Well, I have news for you.

01:18:49.537 --> 01:18:53.201
You are not flying again
anytime soon.

01:18:53.203 --> 01:18:55.236
You get to decide when.

01:18:55.238 --> 01:18:56.702
How long do you wanna wait

01:18:56.704 --> 01:18:58.300
before the next shuttle
is on the launch pad?

01:18:58.302 --> 01:19:00.602
Three years or three decades?

01:19:00.604 --> 01:19:02.403
You decide.

01:19:02.405 --> 01:19:05.569
Mistakes have been made
and if they continue to be made,

01:19:05.571 --> 01:19:07.702
you are never flying again,
ever.

01:19:07.704 --> 01:19:10.266
That decision is made for you.

01:19:10.268 --> 01:19:11.202
No more contracts,

01:19:11.204 --> 01:19:14.337
no more space program,
no more progress.

01:19:14.339 --> 01:19:15.668
This is it.

01:19:15.670 --> 01:19:19.203
History-making time, right now.

01:19:19.205 --> 01:19:20.766
Do you continue
to shoot your mouth off

01:19:20.768 --> 01:19:23.233
with no regard to progress?

01:19:24.304 --> 01:19:26.433
Because if you go
against counsel

01:19:26.435 --> 01:19:27.869
and you perjure yourself,

01:19:27.871 --> 01:19:30.570
or you say something
incriminating by accident,

01:19:30.572 --> 01:19:32.601
that is on you.

01:19:32.603 --> 01:19:34.635
Testifying before
a presidential commission

01:19:34.637 --> 01:19:36.603
is nothing to screw around with.

01:19:39.204 --> 01:19:42.403
And how many
have you testified before?

01:19:42.405 --> 01:19:43.533
I don't testify.

01:19:43.535 --> 01:19:44.501
None.

01:19:44.503 --> 01:19:47.902
You've testified before none,
and I have,

01:19:47.904 --> 01:19:50.202
so that makes me the expert
in this room.

01:19:50.204 --> 01:19:53.467
Yes, no, or I don't know.

01:19:55.369 --> 01:19:57.333
I have to get back to work.

01:19:57.335 --> 01:20:01.266
If you go against us,
you will lose.

01:20:03.204 --> 01:20:04.535
Both of you.

01:20:04.537 --> 01:20:07.668
...at the secondary seal
that we were talked,

01:20:07.670 --> 01:20:11.533
that we alluded to
with the type of erosion,

01:20:11.535 --> 01:20:14.768
uh, that we had was...

01:20:18.370 --> 01:20:20.602
I understand what critically
one means,

01:20:20.604 --> 01:20:23.467
it means it is important
for safety and for flight.

01:20:23.469 --> 01:20:25.869
Is there a high...
higher category than that?

01:20:25.871 --> 01:20:28.668
Let me go back just one moment
to the Cook memorandum.

01:20:28.670 --> 01:20:30.934
He said, "I would think
that any NASA budgets

01:20:30.936 --> 01:20:33.933
submitted this year
for fiscal year 1987,

01:20:33.935 --> 01:20:36.634
should certainly be based
on a reliable judgement."

01:20:36.636 --> 01:20:37.734
Just getting started.

01:20:38.673 --> 01:20:40.367
Anyone know you're here?

01:20:40.369 --> 01:20:42.367
I don't think anyone knows
anyone is here.

01:20:45.268 --> 01:20:48.902
Is there any internal
correspondence

01:20:48.904 --> 01:20:51.569
on potential concern

01:20:51.571 --> 01:20:56.633
over the operation
of the O-rings or the joints?

01:20:56.635 --> 01:20:59.769
We can ask Jim who works
for the contractor that built

01:20:59.771 --> 01:21:02.202
the Solid Rocket Boosters,
if they have anything.

01:21:03.772 --> 01:21:06.937
I believe there's some test data
in progress now.

01:21:06.939 --> 01:21:08.034
Some from before,

01:21:08.036 --> 01:21:11.633
that, uh, speaks to
the resiliency of the O-rings.

01:21:13.368 --> 01:21:14.602
There were some discussions

01:21:14.604 --> 01:21:17.236
the night before the launch,
correct?

01:21:17.238 --> 01:21:20.301
Between you and the people
at contractors company?

01:21:20.771 --> 01:21:21.901
Yes, sir.

01:21:21.903 --> 01:21:24.233
As a matter of routine,

01:21:24.235 --> 01:21:27.266
we ask our technical people,
contractors,

01:21:28.306 --> 01:21:30.268
if there are any concerns.

01:21:30.270 --> 01:21:32.468
And the only concerns
that they pointed out

01:21:32.470 --> 01:21:36.535
were the recovery battery,
um, temperatures.

01:21:36.537 --> 01:21:37.703
And those are located
on the forward end...

01:21:37.705 --> 01:21:38.769
No!

01:21:38.771 --> 01:21:42.536
...of the Solid Rocket Boosters.

01:21:42.538 --> 01:21:47.435
Did you discuss anything with
the contractors or engineers?

01:21:47.437 --> 01:21:53.468
They presented to us the fact
that the lowest temperature

01:21:53.470 --> 01:21:58.901
that we had flown an O-ring
or a case joint was 53 degrees,

01:21:58.903 --> 01:22:01.803
and they wanted to point out

01:22:01.805 --> 01:22:05.769
that we would be outside
our experience base.

01:22:06.805 --> 01:22:07.937
Okay.

01:22:07.939 --> 01:22:11.968
I'm asking because we read
in the <i>New York Times</i>

01:22:11.970 --> 01:22:14.434
about memos to NASA

01:22:14.436 --> 01:22:18.871
expressing concern
about erosion of the O-rings.

01:22:18.873 --> 01:22:22.304
Are there any documents
expressing concern

01:22:22.306 --> 01:22:24.237
about the temperature
that morning?

01:22:26.972 --> 01:22:30.201
I'm not aware
of any such documents.

01:22:35.571 --> 01:22:39.336
I will go back and...
and look, go to my files

01:22:40.237 --> 01:22:41.534
to see if there are any.

01:22:44.504 --> 01:22:45.702
Seriously?

01:22:45.704 --> 01:22:46.903
Guys.

01:22:46.905 --> 01:22:48.266
Liars!

01:22:48.268 --> 01:22:49.835
Shh!

01:22:49.837 --> 01:22:51.135
I can't believe this.

01:22:53.569 --> 01:22:55.735
Someone has to say something.

01:22:55.737 --> 01:22:57.402
Please, the media is here.

01:22:57.404 --> 01:22:58.434
So what?

01:23:02.671 --> 01:23:03.937
What are you doing?

01:23:03.939 --> 01:23:05.235
Please put your hand down.

01:23:05.237 --> 01:23:06.533
I can't let it
go down like this.

01:23:07.538 --> 01:23:08.870
That's not working.

01:23:08.872 --> 01:23:10.136
Shh.

01:23:12.704 --> 01:23:14.603
- There you go.
- Shh!

01:23:14.605 --> 01:23:16.835
Oh, stop it, you.
Go interrupt them.

01:23:16.837 --> 01:23:19.736
...now, we don't know
if he did anything about this.

01:23:19.738 --> 01:23:21.269
- I'm not doing this.
- Go!

01:23:24.604 --> 01:23:28.603
We... we are all seeing this
really for the first time.

01:23:28.605 --> 01:23:30.802
I guess we saw it
in the newspaper...

01:23:30.804 --> 01:23:33.668
I'd like to say about the
meeting you're talking about...

01:23:33.670 --> 01:23:34.670
earlier.

01:23:34.672 --> 01:23:37.237
Am I correct
in assuming that, uh,

01:23:37.239 --> 01:23:40.570
what you described that in
the normal chain of authority,

01:23:40.572 --> 01:23:42.736
neither Mr. Cook
nor Mr. Mann....

01:23:42.738 --> 01:23:45.403
I'd like to say something
about the meeting

01:23:45.405 --> 01:23:46.667
you were talking about.

01:23:47.938 --> 01:23:51.571
Hey, hey,
hold on a second, um...

01:23:51.573 --> 01:23:54.569
I believe Jim Whitt
will have something to add.

01:23:55.871 --> 01:23:57.771
Yes, I'd like to say
about the meeting...

01:23:57.773 --> 01:23:59.536
Excuse me, excuse me.

01:23:59.538 --> 01:24:00.800
Can... can you say that
a little louder

01:24:00.802 --> 01:24:02.301
where everyone can hear you?

01:24:05.574 --> 01:24:07.969
I'd like to say
about the meeting

01:24:07.971 --> 01:24:10.304
you were talking about earlier.

01:24:10.306 --> 01:24:12.570
The meeting was called by us,
the engineers.

01:24:14.574 --> 01:24:17.702
And we tied in Marshal Space
Flight Center

01:24:17.704 --> 01:24:18.802
in Huntsville, Alabama,

01:24:18.804 --> 01:24:21.836
and Kennedy Space Center
in Cape Canaveral, Florida,

01:24:21.838 --> 01:24:24.870
to let them know our concerns
about the colder temperatures,

01:24:24.872 --> 01:24:27.572
and that our recommendation
was not to launch.

01:24:35.871 --> 01:24:37.904
If what I'm hearing is true

01:24:37.906 --> 01:24:41.404
this could be in litigation
for years.

01:24:41.406 --> 01:24:45.472
We initially told them
not to launch below 53 degrees.

01:24:45.474 --> 01:24:47.404
We were convinced the seals
were compromised

01:24:47.406 --> 01:24:50.406
the lower the temperature got.

01:24:50.408 --> 01:24:53.638
We were moving away
from the direction of goodness.

01:24:53.640 --> 01:24:56.238
You never changed your minds
about launching?

01:24:56.240 --> 01:24:57.335
No, sir.

01:24:57.337 --> 01:24:58.403
I was in Kennedy,

01:24:58.405 --> 01:25:04.270
and after Adam and Bill
expressed their concerns,

01:25:04.272 --> 01:25:07.839
our company in Utah
had a private caucus

01:25:07.841 --> 01:25:09.305
and changed their minds.

01:25:10.406 --> 01:25:11.469
You work for that company?

01:25:11.471 --> 01:25:12.837
Yes, sir.

01:25:12.839 --> 01:25:15.637
So you had data and concerns,

01:25:15.639 --> 01:25:17.670
then changed your mind
based on what?

01:25:19.905 --> 01:25:21.371
You'd have to ask them in Utah,

01:25:21.373 --> 01:25:23.971
I was not a part
of the private meeting

01:25:23.973 --> 01:25:26.303
to reevaluate the data.

01:25:26.305 --> 01:25:27.669
Were you gentlemen there
in Utah?

01:25:28.572 --> 01:25:30.271
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

01:25:30.273 --> 01:25:34.537
Did the reevaluation of the data
factor into proceeding to fly?

01:25:34.539 --> 01:25:35.669
Yes, sir.

01:25:37.471 --> 01:25:39.270
Why did you decide to fly?

01:25:39.272 --> 01:25:41.505
- We didn't decide to fly.
- We didn't decide to fly.

01:25:41.507 --> 01:25:42.969
Well, someone did.

01:25:42.971 --> 01:25:45.771
The gentlemen just said
that the private meeting

01:25:45.773 --> 01:25:48.835
resulted in changing
the recommendation to launch.

01:25:48.837 --> 01:25:51.705
And now you're saying
you did not?

01:25:51.707 --> 01:25:54.304
Nelson, did their company
recommend a launch?

01:25:54.306 --> 01:25:55.369
Yes, sir.

01:25:56.672 --> 01:25:58.136
So who changed their mind?

01:26:01.940 --> 01:26:05.903
Bill and I are O-ring experts
and the recommendation

01:26:05.905 --> 01:26:08.704
to launch win
against our recommendation.

01:26:09.704 --> 01:26:12.936
We faxed over a lot of documents

01:26:12.938 --> 01:26:16.870
and our official engineering
perspective to not launch.

01:26:18.472 --> 01:26:21.235
NASA put pressure
on our leadership,

01:26:21.237 --> 01:26:25.506
our boss conveyed a meeting
with everyone in Utah,

01:26:25.508 --> 01:26:27.272
and they decided to launch.

01:26:29.305 --> 01:26:30.571
Did you change your mind?

01:26:30.573 --> 01:26:32.335
No, sir. Never.

01:26:32.337 --> 01:26:33.803
How about you?

01:26:33.805 --> 01:26:35.303
No, sir.

01:26:35.305 --> 01:26:36.471
And you?

01:26:36.473 --> 01:26:39.405
No. In fact, they faxed over
a document

01:26:39.407 --> 01:26:40.771
and tried to get me to sign it,

01:26:40.773 --> 01:26:43.238
recommending we fly
and I refused.

01:26:47.673 --> 01:26:49.537
What were your initial findings?

01:26:49.539 --> 01:26:52.371
When we tested
at the lower temperatures,

01:26:52.373 --> 01:26:54.769
we... we saw that it took...

01:26:54.771 --> 01:26:58.301
Can you quantify how poorly
this is going for you?

01:27:00.704 --> 01:27:03.538
Not as poorly as it's gonna go
for the guy

01:27:03.540 --> 01:27:06.205
who throws his own company
under the bus.

01:27:08.340 --> 01:27:10.571
Maybe you ought to get
a handle on that.

01:27:14.674 --> 01:27:15.873
Mr. Nelson?

01:27:15.875 --> 01:27:17.637
I'd like to see
the signed document

01:27:17.639 --> 01:27:18.805
that recommends to launch.

01:27:18.807 --> 01:27:21.439
Yes, sir.
I have the signed document

01:27:21.441 --> 01:27:24.438
from the contracting company
that recommends to launch.

01:27:52.540 --> 01:27:54.238
What did we all
talked about earlier?

01:27:54.240 --> 01:27:56.737
If you're asked a question,
you say what?

01:27:56.739 --> 01:27:58.839
Yes, no, and what?

01:27:58.841 --> 01:28:00.639
And what did I hear?

01:28:08.272 --> 01:28:11.338
We're the company guys,
we're going to work tomorrow.

01:28:11.340 --> 01:28:12.806
I just wanted you to know,

01:28:12.808 --> 01:28:16.504
what you men did in there today
was incredibly brave.

01:28:16.506 --> 01:28:17.905
Thank you.

01:28:17.907 --> 01:28:19.736
I hope you know
that there are laws

01:28:19.738 --> 01:28:22.538
to protect you
against any retaliation

01:28:22.540 --> 01:28:24.936
for what you have said
here today.

01:28:24.938 --> 01:28:27.237
We'll see.

01:28:27.239 --> 01:28:29.607
Is anything gonna happen
to these guys?

01:28:29.609 --> 01:28:33.338
We are here to learn
and to make recommendations

01:28:33.340 --> 01:28:35.870
to the President
and then he will decide.

01:28:35.872 --> 01:28:38.572
I think the best thing to do

01:28:38.574 --> 01:28:40.238
is to simply keep telling
the truth.

01:28:40.909 --> 01:28:41.906
Yes, ma'am.

01:29:21.506 --> 01:29:22.736
I'm not hungry anymore.

01:29:24.942 --> 01:29:26.273
He'll come around.

01:29:29.240 --> 01:29:30.303
No, he won't.

01:29:31.806 --> 01:29:33.339
- <i>Adam.</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

01:29:33.341 --> 01:29:38.305
I just wanted to ask you,
um, we have no proof.

01:29:38.307 --> 01:29:41.840
You don't have any money
to afford a team like this.

01:29:41.842 --> 01:29:44.471
And I can already see
it's an unwinnable case.

01:29:44.473 --> 01:29:46.838
So what's the real reason
you wanna do this?

01:29:48.972 --> 01:29:50.704
No one was prosecuted.

01:29:52.342 --> 01:29:54.538
No one lost their jobs
except for the people

01:29:54.540 --> 01:29:56.371
<i>who were trying to do
the right thing.</i>

01:29:58.241 --> 01:30:01.941
<i>And now, seven
of society's finest are dead.</i>

01:30:01.943 --> 01:30:03.473
<i>And they're gonna stay dead.</i>

01:30:04.710 --> 01:30:06.371
Don't you think we need
to try something?

01:30:06.373 --> 01:30:08.205
I do.

01:30:08.207 --> 01:30:11.304
But it's just going to wind up
being a stunt

01:30:11.306 --> 01:30:12.972
to try the case in public,

01:30:12.974 --> 01:30:15.241
and give them a black eye
in the news

01:30:15.243 --> 01:30:16.240
for a couple of days.

01:30:18.676 --> 01:30:20.473
I can live with that.

01:30:20.475 --> 01:30:23.572
You do know beating up
the bully won't bring you peace.

01:30:25.308 --> 01:30:26.838
Maybe it'll bring justice.

01:30:29.508 --> 01:30:31.506
Have you ever gotten
either one that way?

01:30:48.441 --> 01:30:50.440
I don't care
what you have to say.

01:31:31.709 --> 01:31:34.241
I am an O-ring expert.

01:31:34.243 --> 01:31:35.805
I worked for the company
that built

01:31:35.807 --> 01:31:37.307
the Solid Rocket Boosters

01:31:37.309 --> 01:31:39.608
for the Space Shuttle
Challenger.

01:31:39.610 --> 01:31:43.273
And the decision to launch
went against our recommendation.

01:31:47.540 --> 01:31:49.239
But I guess you knew
that already, huh?

01:31:54.340 --> 01:31:57.337
I wanna ask you, how many of you
are planning to be engineers?

01:32:01.310 --> 01:32:04.472
Everyone. Okay.

01:32:05.376 --> 01:32:06.373
That's great.

01:32:07.877 --> 01:32:10.208
Really, that is...
that is great.

01:32:13.677 --> 01:32:14.973
You know, what... what I think

01:32:14.975 --> 01:32:16.541
I want to talk to you
about today

01:32:16.543 --> 01:32:20.639
is about the value
of the human life.

01:32:20.641 --> 01:32:24.808
<i>Because all of you
are gonna go on to build roads,</i>

01:32:24.810 --> 01:32:32.373
<i>bridges, toys, cars, rockets,
homes, whatever.</i>

01:32:32.375 --> 01:32:35.572
<i>Whatever it is, an engineer
thinks it and makes it.</i>

01:32:46.977 --> 01:32:50.440
- Hi, dad.
- Hey, kids. Hi, girls.

01:32:50.442 --> 01:32:52.840
- Hey. We'll be back later.
- Hi.

01:33:24.275 --> 01:33:27.606
<i>But I just want you to remember</i>

01:33:27.608 --> 01:33:29.906
<i>to see the people
on the other side</i>

01:33:29.908 --> 01:33:32.972
<i>of whatever it is that you make.</i>

01:33:32.974 --> 01:33:35.772
<i>And also remember
the people you made it with.</i>

01:33:36.442 --> 01:33:37.440
<i>Yeah?</i>
