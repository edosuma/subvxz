WEBVTT

00:36.148 --> 00:37.314
Think it's ready for bullets.

00:37.416 --> 00:39.133
Oh, boy.

00:39.235 --> 00:41.335
My head hurts when you get
all existential and shit.

00:41.437 --> 00:45.072
This morning the Wi-Fi
shuts down for no reason.

00:45.174 --> 00:47.207
Took me forever
to get it back up.

00:47.309 --> 00:50.911
 Then I waited five minutes
for my coffee.

00:51.013 --> 00:52.346
Five minutes!

00:52.448 --> 00:54.164
But you got through it, bro.

00:54.250 --> 00:56.900
 You faced it head on
and you came out the other side.

00:57.002 --> 00:58.969
 I'm proud of you.

00:59.071 --> 01:00.904
(sighs)

01:01.006 --> 01:02.306
 On the way home,

01:02.408 --> 01:04.141
 I'm in the left lane
 at the intersection.

01:04.242 --> 01:06.143
I missed the left turn arrow,
but then the light

01:06.245 --> 01:07.377
 turns from arrow to green.

01:07.480 --> 01:10.114
The car in front of me
 just sits there.

01:10.216 --> 01:11.448
Doesn't pull
into the intersection.

01:11.550 --> 01:14.234
The driver doesn't get
that a green light means

01:14.336 --> 01:15.969
you can make
a fucking left-hand turn

01:16.072 --> 01:17.171
 if there's no oncoming traffic,

01:17.273 --> 01:19.139
even without
 a fucking left-hand turn arrow.

01:19.241 --> 01:21.208
 He doesn't move.

01:21.310 --> 01:23.043
 The driver needs
the fucking arrow.

01:23.145 --> 01:25.179
People have to be pointed
 in the exact fucking direction.

01:25.281 --> 01:27.281
When did everyone become
so fucking stupid?!

01:27.383 --> 01:30.200
I don't know. Maybe they weren't
so smart to begin with.

01:30.302 --> 01:32.436
Nothing works.

01:34.006 --> 01:35.172
 All of this just needs to end.

01:35.274 --> 01:37.040
The worst part is,

01:37.143 --> 01:38.175
 I just realized,

01:38.277 --> 01:39.910
 I hate this fucking coffee.

01:40.012 --> 01:42.112
This coffee tastes
like burnt asshole.

01:42.214 --> 01:43.313
Why is this called
 signature roast?

01:43.415 --> 01:45.099
Who is signing for this shit?

01:45.201 --> 01:46.900
 Okay, dude.

01:47.002 --> 01:49.036
 It's not about the coffee, bro.
It's about Michael.

01:49.138 --> 01:51.205
Don't even bring him up.

01:51.307 --> 01:53.173
 Our little lost Antichrist.

01:53.275 --> 01:55.976
Show some respect, bro.
He's the son of Satan.

01:56.078 --> 01:58.212
Well, Satan might want
to get a paternity test.

01:58.314 --> 02:00.180
We've only been waiting
for this dude our whole lives

02:00.282 --> 02:03.100
to put an end
 to all this bullshit.

02:03.202 --> 02:04.234
Give us a world
that's worth the hate.

02:04.336 --> 02:06.270
 And what does he say
when he gets here?

02:06.372 --> 02:09.205
"I don't know
what I'm supposed to do."

02:09.308 --> 02:11.041
Cut him some slack, okay?

02:11.143 --> 02:13.076
 Even Jesus needed time
to figure shit out.

02:13.179 --> 02:14.411
That's why he went
to the desert, bro.

02:14.513 --> 02:16.246
 The freaking desert? You're
 saying that's where Michael is?

02:16.348 --> 02:17.414
 -The freaking desert?
-No.

02:17.516 --> 02:19.099
I don't know
 where the fuck he is.

02:19.201 --> 02:20.300
 I'm just saying,
maybe he needs time

02:20.402 --> 02:21.969
to get his head together,
you know?

02:22.071 --> 02:23.937
 -Maybe he's looking for a sign.
 -A sign?

02:24.039 --> 02:26.106
 All the guy needs to do
 is look around.

02:26.208 --> 02:28.108
The world is
a raging clusterfuck.

02:28.210 --> 02:32.079
 And we need to burn
this motherfucker to the ground!

02:32.181 --> 02:33.914
Wipe the slate clean
 and start over.

02:34.016 --> 02:35.899
 This time do it right.

02:36.001 --> 02:37.434
     (footfalls approaching)

02:42.341 --> 02:43.307
   You asked me to remind you

02:43.409 --> 02:45.209
  about the Cooperative meeting
           next week.

02:45.311 --> 02:48.045
             Right.

02:50.249 --> 02:53.133
      This is the reminder.

02:53.235 --> 02:57.171
   Consider us duly reminded.
      Thanks, Ms. Venable.

02:57.273 --> 02:59.439
         Anything else?

03:01.477 --> 03:05.179
  You promised to give me more
  agency in day-to-day matters.

03:05.347 --> 03:07.381
          This would be
       a good opportunity.

03:07.483 --> 03:09.166
   -What is this Cooperative?
             -Uh...

03:09.268 --> 03:11.168
You heard of movers and shakers?

03:11.270 --> 03:13.003
      These are the people
 that make them shake and move.

03:13.105 --> 03:14.404
 That visitor you had last week.

03:14.506 --> 03:17.341
         Is he a member?

03:17.443 --> 03:19.276
              MUTT:
          Not exactly.

03:19.378 --> 03:21.345
     VENABLE: There must be
     a part I can play here.

03:21.447 --> 03:23.247
      With The Cooperative.

03:23.349 --> 03:27.334
      Trust us, that's not
    your domain, Ms. Venable.

03:27.436 --> 03:30.103
 But, for our flight, could you
    get us those stewardesses

03:30.206 --> 03:32.239
        we had last time?
     From Mile High Escorts?

03:32.341 --> 03:34.908
         -Oh, shit, yes.
          -JEFF: Yeah.

03:35.010 --> 03:36.977
     Do I need to remind you
   that I was the first person

03:37.079 --> 03:39.079
   you hired when this company
          was operating

03:39.181 --> 03:40.247
    out of the back of a van?

03:40.349 --> 03:43.000
        I have given you
       everything I have.

03:43.102 --> 03:45.235
   Every second of every day.

03:45.337 --> 03:48.305
  I've sacrificed any semblance
       of a personal life.

03:48.407 --> 03:52.910
  Friendships. Family. I don't
    even have a decent hobby.

03:53.012 --> 03:56.246
          Ms. Venable,
     there's an old saying.

03:56.348 --> 03:58.999
         "If you aren't
      where you want to be,

03:59.101 --> 04:00.400
    just look in the mirror."

04:02.438 --> 04:04.004
   Are you actually referring

04:04.106 --> 04:06.073
       -to my disability?
              -No.

04:06.175 --> 04:08.075
      Your scoliosis isn't
    the problem, Ms. Venable.

04:08.177 --> 04:09.309
 It's the chip on your shoulder.

04:09.411 --> 04:12.246
              MUTT:
     But we still love you.

04:12.348 --> 04:15.082
   Mile High Escorts, please.

04:15.184 --> 04:20.170
   Make your own arrangements.
         I'm done here.

04:21.373 --> 04:23.056
              MUTT:
            Whatever.

04:23.142 --> 04:25.175
        She'll calm down;
        she always does.

04:25.277 --> 04:29.346
        She just gave me
      a great fucking idea.

04:29.448 --> 04:33.233
        A way through all
    of our Antichrist issues.

04:35.004 --> 04:37.437
               ¶ ¶

05:06.502 --> 05:09.202

05:45.140 --> 05:47.307
               ¶ ¶

06:04.176 --> 06:06.343
    You're pushing too hard.

06:06.445 --> 06:08.445
         I don't get it;
  I used to be able to do this.

06:08.547 --> 06:12.165
    MYRTLE: You're exhausting
         yourself, dear.

06:12.267 --> 06:14.468
  Try to relax. Don't force it.

06:14.570 --> 06:16.169
             MYRTLE:
      Witchcraft is an art.

06:16.271 --> 06:19.573
 But our powers only develop as
 fast as our cerebellum allows.

06:19.675 --> 06:21.308
            CORDELIA:
      So just give it time.

06:21.410 --> 06:23.410
    That's all we're saying.

06:23.512 --> 06:25.178
   What if we don't have time?

06:25.280 --> 06:27.247
        Michael told you
  he was coming to kill us all.

06:27.349 --> 06:30.300
      We'll be fine as long
 as we stay here, in this house.

06:30.402 --> 06:33.336
I put all of Robichaux under the
  protection of an aura shield.

06:33.439 --> 06:36.306
    Every witch will be safe,

06:36.408 --> 06:40.110
      but any human, demon,
or other will find it impossible

06:40.212 --> 06:41.445
 to step through our front door.

06:41.547 --> 06:43.246
              ZOE:
    <i> We can't always control</i>

06:43.348 --> 06:44.481
     the energies around us.

06:44.583 --> 06:47.167
  Negative emotions, sickness,

06:47.269 --> 06:49.102
 toxic people, unwanted spirits.

06:49.204 --> 06:50.504
  These things are unavoidable.

06:50.606 --> 06:52.205
          Like the clap
       at Plato's Retreat.

06:52.307 --> 06:53.507
              ZOE:
   But the Guardian's Chalice

06:53.609 --> 06:55.275
  is our first line of defense
      against all of that.

06:55.377 --> 06:58.245
  Uh, a bear trap for bad juju.

06:58.347 --> 07:00.213
       You just stash one
      in or around a space

07:00.315 --> 07:01.348
     you want to protect...

07:01.450 --> 07:03.100
         And even that's
      not gonna be enough.

07:03.202 --> 07:06.503
    Not without this dope-ass
    mantra to recite before.

07:06.605 --> 07:10.507
   That's gonna put all of the
 power into these jars of junk.

07:10.609 --> 07:15.312
    Everyone repeat after me.
      We'll do it together.

07:15.414 --> 07:19.199
    ALL: Any unwanted spirits
      and negative energy,

07:19.301 --> 07:22.235
       you must leave now.

07:24.306 --> 07:28.508
       Any evil presences,
        leave this space.

07:28.610 --> 07:32.446
(fading): Only light and healing
  energy is allowed in here...

07:32.548 --> 07:36.199
   (speaking foreign language)

07:54.436 --> 07:56.369
      (distorted chanting)

08:00.375 --> 08:02.242
             (moans)

08:04.580 --> 08:06.613
            WITCHES:
       Negative energies,

08:06.715 --> 08:08.615
       you must leave now.

08:11.403 --> 08:14.437
         Evil presences,
        leave this space.

08:14.540 --> 08:19.309
  Only light and healing energy
        is allowed here.

08:19.411 --> 08:21.578
 Clearly that mantra's bullshit.

08:23.515 --> 08:26.166
    Oh, come on, you can't be
    that surprised to see me.

08:26.268 --> 08:29.236
 Fuck no, you were prophesized,
            darling.

08:29.338 --> 08:31.471
            Up yours.

08:31.573 --> 08:35.342
      I told Cordelia what
  I was gonna do to all of you.

08:35.443 --> 08:37.544
    I have deaths to avenge.

08:42.534 --> 08:44.501
             (gasps)

08:49.374 --> 08:50.340
            QUEENIE:
             Mead?!

08:50.442 --> 08:51.474
   How the fuck are you here?!

08:51.577 --> 08:53.443
      I was built for this.

08:56.448 --> 08:58.415
        (girls screaming)

09:00.602 --> 09:02.536
      QUEENIE (distorted):
              Shit!

09:03.572 --> 09:06.373
       Oh, God. It's him.

09:16.401 --> 09:18.235
 MYRTLE: <i> We need to leave before</i>
 <i> Michael finds his way up here.</i>

09:18.337 --> 09:20.437
    -No, we need to stop him.
   -We have to keep you safe.

09:20.539 --> 09:22.205
       I don't understand;
     our sisters are dying.

09:22.307 --> 09:24.307
   There is nothing you can do
   to help; you are not ready.

09:24.409 --> 09:25.375
            (gunfire)

09:25.477 --> 09:27.544
    <i> He is going to kill you,</i>

09:27.646 --> 09:29.112
  and I can't let that happen.

09:29.214 --> 09:30.180
            (gunfire)

09:32.568 --> 09:36.503
       -(girl whimpering)
           -(gunshots)

09:38.273 --> 09:41.541
         So... we good?

09:41.643 --> 09:43.476
        Better than good.

09:43.579 --> 09:46.513
       I'll put in a word
         with my father.

09:46.615 --> 09:50.400
       Satan just greenlit
 your talk show for 13 episodes.

10:06.635 --> 10:08.602
               ¶ ¶

10:23.201 --> 10:25.368
           LANGDON:
           <i> We failed.</i>

10:25.470 --> 10:26.503
             Again.

10:26.605 --> 10:29.539
 The witches we actually wanted
        to kill got away.

10:29.641 --> 10:32.275
     Cordelia fucked with me
  and my people, and for that,

10:32.377 --> 10:34.377
    all I wanted was to watch
     her die, but instead...

10:34.479 --> 10:37.180
 You're angry, and I understand,

10:37.282 --> 10:39.499
  but this is still a victory.

10:39.601 --> 10:42.535
    And besides, your destiny
       is to end the world

10:42.638 --> 10:45.171
      with a rain of fire.

10:45.273 --> 10:47.207
      Killing those witches
      ain't gonna do that.

10:47.309 --> 10:49.175
    You were the one who said
    the way to end the world

10:49.277 --> 10:51.111
         was with magic.

10:51.213 --> 10:54.114
   You said either the witches
  and warlocks stood behind us

10:54.216 --> 10:55.181
        or we kill them.

10:55.283 --> 10:57.167
 Well, that was our plan before,

10:57.269 --> 10:59.202
 maybe we need to change course.

10:59.304 --> 11:01.338
    What does that even mean?

11:01.440 --> 11:03.540
   -This guy's a fucking mess.
             -Yeah.

11:03.642 --> 11:05.542
    Don't even get me started
          on his hair.

11:05.711 --> 11:09.179
     Why don't we just focus
on getting him to end the world?

11:09.281 --> 11:11.581
  Okay. Yeah. Tell him to burn
this motherfucker to the ground.

11:11.683 --> 11:13.600
           (laughing):
              Yeah.

11:13.702 --> 11:16.236
   MS. MEAD: <i> It's time to burn</i>
        <i> the sucker down,</i>

11:16.338 --> 11:19.439
       and you don't need
         magic for that.

11:19.541 --> 11:21.608
          And besides,
     when you end the world,

11:21.710 --> 11:23.209
      you end the witches.

11:23.311 --> 11:25.278
            Come on.

11:25.380 --> 11:27.213
     Michael, think bigger.

11:27.315 --> 11:30.533
      I... I have actually
          been thinking

11:30.635 --> 11:32.235
        about some other
        possible avenues.

11:32.337 --> 11:35.405
  See, that's great. Like what?

11:35.507 --> 11:38.475
Maybe I could run for president.

11:38.577 --> 11:41.111
              Okay.

11:41.213 --> 11:45.315
 Yeah, that could be problematic
      for a lot of reasons.

11:45.417 --> 11:47.534
   You look barely old enough
         to rent a car.

11:47.652 --> 11:50.236
   Sure, but I could start out
        as an ambassador

11:50.338 --> 11:51.371
       and then I'd become

11:51.473 --> 11:54.407
     one of the president's
     most trusted advisors.

11:54.509 --> 11:56.409
          What the fuck
      is he talking about?

11:56.511 --> 12:01.214
         I think I know,
       and it's not good.

12:01.316 --> 12:05.235
 MS. MEAD: Michael, this sounds
          like the plot

12:05.404 --> 12:06.403
        of <i> The Omen III.</i>

12:06.505 --> 12:08.138
          Is this where
   you're getting your ideas?

12:08.240 --> 12:09.472
       Well, I don't know
       where else to look.

12:09.574 --> 12:11.307
  It's not like there's a bunch
      of reference material

12:11.410 --> 12:13.443
  on how to be the Antichrist.

12:13.545 --> 12:14.611
            Aw, dude!

12:14.713 --> 12:17.414
       Relax! I got this.

12:17.516 --> 12:20.567
 Sometimes you have to bring in
  the big guns to take it home.

12:20.669 --> 12:22.268
            Whatever.

12:22.370 --> 12:24.304
         MS. MEAD: Okay.
   We could go to the guys who

12:24.406 --> 12:27.273
     brought me back to you.
  Maybe they have the answers.

12:27.375 --> 12:30.110
 Really? They seem like a bunch
    of coked out nerds to me.

12:30.212 --> 12:32.345
         -(scoffs) Rude.
        -MS. MEAD: Uh-uh.

12:32.447 --> 12:35.315
       They're very smart,
  not to mention good-looking.

12:35.417 --> 12:36.466
           (chuckles)

12:44.509 --> 12:46.409
         Okay. We'll go.

12:46.511 --> 12:49.479
              BOTH:
           Yeah! Boom!

12:56.404 --> 12:58.338
             Putin,

12:58.440 --> 13:00.106
       Buffett, Clinton...

13:00.208 --> 13:01.274
     Oh, Bill, not Hillary.

13:01.376 --> 13:02.408
              JEFF:
             Mm-hmm.

13:02.511 --> 13:05.078
        -Kim Pyong So...
          -General Kim.

13:05.247 --> 13:07.180
      Dude controls all the
 nuclear weapons in North Korea.

13:07.282 --> 13:09.265
     I don't get it, how are
   all these people connected?

13:09.367 --> 13:11.234
  That's a list of 100 members

13:11.336 --> 13:14.304
         of the world's
   most powerful organization,

13:14.406 --> 13:16.506
   called... The Cooperative.

13:16.608 --> 13:19.309
       Yeah, except no one
       in The Cooperative

13:19.411 --> 13:21.511
    would ever admit to being
       in The Cooperative.

13:21.613 --> 13:24.481
     Also, "The Cooperative"
         is a code name.

13:24.583 --> 13:28.268
        The real name...
       is the Illuminati.

13:28.370 --> 13:31.204
    And, actually, this list
    doesn't exist. Bye, list.

13:31.306 --> 13:33.239
 You guys are in the Illuminati?

13:33.341 --> 13:36.276
          Well, I mean,
 were that group to exist, yeah,

13:36.378 --> 13:38.178
         you might find
       some familiar names

13:38.280 --> 13:40.346
   on the roster at number 69.

13:40.448 --> 13:42.182
           (laughing):
               69.

13:42.284 --> 13:43.299
              Yeah!

13:43.401 --> 13:45.301
          The point is,

13:45.403 --> 13:47.370
    The Cooperative controls
the money, the arts, the armies,

13:47.472 --> 13:50.440
    the thoughts, everything.
   They run the fucking world.

13:50.542 --> 13:52.141
              MUTT:
 And everyone in The Cooperative

13:52.244 --> 13:56.145
     has sold their soul...
          to the Devil,

13:56.248 --> 13:59.265
  which means that you control
        The Cooperative.

13:59.367 --> 14:00.567
     Daddy set you up, bro.

14:00.669 --> 14:03.303
  They've been waiting for the
 Antichrist. You just tell them

14:03.405 --> 14:06.339
   what you want and when you
want it, and they have to do it.

14:06.441 --> 14:08.341
    They're basically, like,
        your army, dude.

14:08.443 --> 14:10.510
      Wh-What am I supposed
        to do with them?

14:10.612 --> 14:12.512
   Hmm? If magic wasn't enough
 to bring about the end-times...

14:12.614 --> 14:13.613
       Uh, no, no, no, no.

14:13.715 --> 14:16.199
      You don't need magic
   to destroy the world, bro,

14:16.301 --> 14:17.333
   not when you have science.

14:17.435 --> 14:19.569
              JEFF:
   And humanity. People suck.

14:19.671 --> 14:21.271
         They're selfish
       and short-sighted.

14:21.373 --> 14:22.539
     All anyone cares about
   is immediate gratification.

14:22.641 --> 14:26.142
            (snorts)

14:26.244 --> 14:27.510
   (clears throat) And that's
     why everything happens.

14:27.612 --> 14:30.079
   One shitty self-serving act
           at a time.

14:30.181 --> 14:33.132
  You multiply one bad impulse
    by seven billion people,

14:33.235 --> 14:34.400
     you get global warming.

14:34.502 --> 14:35.468
    -You get mass extinction.
              -Yes.

14:35.587 --> 14:38.338
  -You definitely get genocide.
           -Yes, yes.

14:38.440 --> 14:39.472
I mean, it's sheer numbers, bro.

14:39.574 --> 14:42.075
    Math is way more powerful
           than magic.

14:42.177 --> 14:44.143
  We are totally ready to give
        the middle finger

14:44.246 --> 14:47.113
          to the world
      and restart mankind.

14:47.215 --> 14:48.448
     It's the prophecy, bro.

14:48.550 --> 14:51.467
  You will reign for a thousand
years of fire. It's in the book.

14:51.570 --> 14:53.236
              -I...
     -It's in the good book.

14:53.338 --> 14:56.172
You read this book? Revelations.

14:56.274 --> 14:58.241
          You read it?

15:03.448 --> 15:05.315
          What's next?

15:05.483 --> 15:07.433
     Okay, so Dead Hand is a
 Russian nuclear defense system

15:07.535 --> 15:10.303
        set up for mutual
      assured destruction.

15:10.405 --> 15:12.472
        In the event that
  a nuclear attack is detected,

15:12.574 --> 15:14.140
        counter missiles
        will be launched

15:14.242 --> 15:16.409
   automatically, even if all
  the commanders on the ground

15:16.478 --> 15:19.145
           -are dead.
            -(laughs)

15:19.247 --> 15:20.580
     With the people we know
     in positions of power,

15:20.682 --> 15:22.415
          all you need
      for Armageddon, bro,

15:22.517 --> 15:24.567
        are three people
      in the right places,

15:24.669 --> 15:26.202
   pushing the right buttons.

15:26.304 --> 15:27.604
     (imitating explosions)

15:30.375 --> 15:32.275
        Will it be enough
      to kill the witches?

15:32.377 --> 15:35.378
    Yeah. I mean, definitely.

15:35.480 --> 15:36.512
            -Ideally.
             -Yeah.

15:36.615 --> 15:39.265
        All you got to do
        is talk to them.

15:52.113 --> 15:53.146
         COCO: Oh, God.
     Are we even safe here?

15:53.248 --> 15:55.415
     The Swamp Witch's shack
    may be a grimy shit hole,

15:55.517 --> 15:56.399
  but it's definitely secluded.

15:56.501 --> 15:58.067
             MYRTLE:
The only other person that knows

15:58.169 --> 15:59.168
    it's here is dear Misty,

15:59.270 --> 16:00.336
   and she's off gallivanting
          with Stevie.

16:00.438 --> 16:02.171
       Oh, my poor girls.

16:02.273 --> 16:03.573
          She's there.

16:21.509 --> 16:23.609

16:51.473 --> 16:54.240
           -(screams)
              -¶ ¶

16:55.343 --> 16:56.409
            Oh, God.

17:02.350 --> 17:03.299
             (gasps)

17:05.403 --> 17:07.369
It's us, Delia. You're safe now.

17:10.442 --> 17:13.342
     I saw them. I saw them,
    but I couldn't feel them.

17:15.313 --> 17:18.181
    (crying): I couldn't feel
 their souls, there was nothing.

17:18.282 --> 17:21.166
   I couldn't bring them back.
 Why couldn't I bring them back?

17:23.204 --> 17:24.170
            Oh, shit.

17:25.205 --> 17:27.240
              What?

17:27.342 --> 17:29.509
             -Um...
          -What is it?

17:29.611 --> 17:33.146
    When we went to the house
     where Michael was born,

17:33.248 --> 17:35.181
          we found out
     he could do this thing.

17:35.283 --> 17:37.433
     After he kills someone,

17:37.535 --> 17:40.470
   he can... erase their soul.

17:40.572 --> 17:43.372
          He can, like,

17:43.475 --> 17:45.341
        burn their soul,
    so there's nothing left.

17:45.443 --> 17:47.210
     They don't go anywhere,
       they're not ghosts.

17:47.312 --> 17:49.178
         They're just...

17:49.280 --> 17:51.414
              gone.

17:54.302 --> 17:55.268

17:55.370 --> 17:56.502
How could you keep this from me?

17:56.604 --> 17:58.237
  You put all of us in danger!

17:58.339 --> 18:00.239
           I told you
     he was the Antichrist!

18:00.341 --> 18:02.475
-What more did you need to know?
     -This will do no good.

18:02.577 --> 18:04.310
We can't turn on each other now.

18:04.412 --> 18:06.446
        None of this will
      bring back our girls.

18:06.548 --> 18:09.282
      They're gone, Delia.

18:09.384 --> 18:11.434

           No, please,

18:15.306 --> 18:17.473
     there must be something
           we can do.

18:35.310 --> 18:37.043

18:37.145 --> 18:39.112
      There has never been
   a confirmed case of a witch

18:39.214 --> 18:41.114
           who has it.

18:41.216 --> 18:43.366
  A girl imbued with this gift

18:43.468 --> 18:46.268
    is said to have the power
     to change past events,

18:46.337 --> 18:49.071
         alter history.

18:49.174 --> 18:52.108

 It sounds preposterous, I know.

18:54.579 --> 18:56.445
      I myself dismissed it
         as mere legend,

18:56.548 --> 19:00.166
     until our young Supreme
    found a road-killed deer

19:00.268 --> 19:02.401

     bring it back to life,

19:02.504 --> 19:05.171
 she reversed the flow of time,
   returning it to its youth.

  If you were able to do this,

19:07.675 --> 19:10.409

  The tricentennial celebration

19:46.514 --> 19:48.247
   A family that, to my mind,

19:48.349 --> 19:51.100
      marked the historical
       height of grandeur.

19:51.202 --> 19:54.036
   There were feasts, operas.

        <i> tried to stop it</i>
    <i> with a protection spell.</i>

22:38.236 --> 22:40.036
  (Anastasia chanting quietly)

22:40.138 --> 22:43.105
        <i> As it turns out,</i>
<i>little Anastasia was one of us.</i>

22:43.207 --> 22:45.107
            <i> A witch.</i>

22:45.209 --> 22:47.143
  ANASTASIA: <i> Repellendum malum</i>
       <i> minatur, ut nobis.</i>

22:47.245 --> 22:50.112
   <i> Repellendum malum minatur,</i>
    <i> ut nobis. Repellendum...</i>

22:50.214 --> 22:51.280
           -(gunshot)
            -(gasps)

22:51.382 --> 22:52.515
         (women scream)

22:53.601 --> 22:55.067
           Nyet, nyet.

22:55.169 --> 22:56.235
        (speaks Russian)

22:57.572 --> 22:59.238
      <i> Repellendum, rep...</i>

22:59.340 --> 23:01.407
       <i> Repellendum, rep--</i>
         <i> repellendum...</i>

23:04.312 --> 23:07.246
            (screams)
              Papa!

23:10.368 --> 23:12.168
              Mama!

23:15.606 --> 23:18.441
 Her power was not great enough
        to defy her fate.

23:18.543 --> 23:20.276
        Perhaps yours is.

23:20.378 --> 23:23.212
       You want to send me
  a hundred years into the past

23:23.314 --> 23:25.247
            to thwart
    the Bolshevik Revolution?

23:25.349 --> 23:27.466
       We need a dry run--

23:27.568 --> 23:30.069
    a way to test your power
     without the possibility

23:30.171 --> 23:31.303
 that Michael will learn of it.

23:31.406 --> 23:32.538
       He's too powerful.

23:32.640 --> 23:35.074
 MYRTLE: Besides, the Bolsheviks
     had already won, dear.

23:35.176 --> 23:39.278
   Young Anastasia's survival
 will be proof of your success.

23:44.569 --> 23:47.136
         Hold it close.

23:59.517 --> 24:02.034
       Bear with me, dear.

24:02.136 --> 24:05.137
   This is an unfortunate case
 of the blind leading the blind.

24:05.306 --> 24:07.273
Which I'm sure is of no comfort,

24:07.375 --> 24:11.143
 considering the risk of failure
   is death, but here we are.

24:11.245 --> 24:14.280
        Close your eyes.
       Take a deep breath.

24:14.382 --> 24:16.315
     Let my voice guide you.

24:16.417 --> 24:18.534
 In order to achieve this feat,

24:18.636 --> 24:22.271
     you must place yourself
  in a different state of mind,

24:22.373 --> 24:27.209
        so shed your ego,
   disengage from this realm.

24:27.311 --> 24:30.045
 Focus your energy on the jewel.

24:30.148 --> 24:33.299
    Use it to place yourself
         in that night.

24:33.401 --> 24:34.567
         See the cellar.

24:37.371 --> 24:40.506
      MYRTLE AND CORDELIA:
       <i> Balneum infinitum.</i>

24:40.608 --> 24:45.344
     <i> Dona salui conductus.</i>

24:45.446 --> 24:49.081
       <i> Balneum infinitum.</i>

24:49.183 --> 24:51.400
     <i> Dona salui conductus.</i>

24:51.502 --> 24:57.072
       <i> Balneum infinitum.</i>
     <i> Dona salui conductus.</i>

24:57.175 --> 25:00.109
       (chanting echoing)

25:00.211 --> 25:02.311
          It's working.

25:07.568 --> 25:09.235

25:21.282 --> 25:23.299
       (chanting quietly)

25:26.170 --> 25:28.103
           -(screams)
   -Shh. I'm here to help you.

25:28.206 --> 25:29.338
      Do you understand me?

25:29.440 --> 25:32.074
 These men are going to kill you
        and your family.

25:32.176 --> 25:34.243
I know what you're trying to do,
   but you can't do it alone.

25:34.345 --> 25:36.145
      Here, take my hands.

25:36.247 --> 25:38.981
    -Don't you want to live?
              -Yes.

25:39.083 --> 25:40.199
    You're gonna live, okay?

25:42.236 --> 25:44.203
    -BOTH: <i> Repellendum malum</i>

25:46.507 --> 25:49.041
       <i> Repellendum malum</i>

25:49.143 --> 25:51.143

25:54.348 --> 25:55.347

25:55.449 --> 25:58.000
   <i> Repellendum malum minatur,</i>
           <i> ut nobis.</i>

25:58.102 --> 26:00.169
       (speaking Russian)

26:00.271 --> 26:02.171
        (women screaming)

26:02.273 --> 26:04.039
    I'm gonna try and create
   a way out of here. Come on.

26:09.347 --> 26:12.081
        (women screaming)

26:12.183 --> 26:13.398
               No!

26:13.467 --> 26:16.335
           No! No! No!

26:16.437 --> 26:19.138
           (screaming)

26:19.240 --> 26:21.440
       I have to go back!
          I have to go.

26:21.559 --> 26:24.143
        -Shh. Look at me.
         -I have to go.
       I have to go back.

26:24.245 --> 26:26.445
           (shushing)

26:26.547 --> 26:28.480
          You're here.

26:28.583 --> 26:30.165
        You are with us.

26:30.234 --> 26:33.335
-You are safe. It's me. It's me.
       -I have to go back.

26:33.437 --> 26:37.172
 Keep breathing. Keep breathing.

26:40.344 --> 26:44.079
         Shh. It's okay.

26:46.217 --> 26:48.968
            CORDELIA:
    <i> She almost died, Myrtle.</i>

26:49.070 --> 26:51.103
The damn spell didn't even work.

26:51.205 --> 26:52.404
       But it did, Delia.

26:52.506 --> 26:54.273
     She was able to go back
      and pierce the veil.

26:54.375 --> 26:56.308
       If she can do that,
    she can do what's needed.

26:56.410 --> 27:00.412
      Our powers are tied.

27:00.514 --> 27:04.400
    Mallory will never really
    be ready until I'm gone.

27:04.502 --> 27:07.136
 We're not ready to let you go.

27:07.238 --> 27:10.406
      I can't stop thinking
        about my mother.

27:10.508 --> 27:12.441
  I've spent so much of my life

27:12.543 --> 27:16.578
     running in the opposite
       direction of Fiona.

27:19.183 --> 27:20.432
        God, I hated her.

27:20.534 --> 27:24.236
    For never thinking beyond
    her own selfish desires,

27:24.338 --> 27:26.405
       even when our coven
         was in danger.

27:26.507 --> 27:30.476
      But now here I am...

27:30.578 --> 27:33.112
        and I'm not ready
        to let go either.

27:33.214 --> 27:34.446
       We all die, petal.

27:36.484 --> 27:39.368
         Some of us make
      rather a habit of it.

27:39.470 --> 27:41.970
         (both chuckle)

27:42.073 --> 27:45.441
        I feel I've made
     so many bad decisions,

27:45.543 --> 27:48.344
      so many wrong turns.

27:48.446 --> 27:52.381
  I don't trust myself to know
      what's right anymore.

27:55.236 --> 27:59.371
      You would tell me...

27:59.473 --> 28:02.141
       if I've become her.

28:02.243 --> 28:04.309
Just the fact that you're asking
  me this gives you the answer.

28:04.412 --> 28:07.246
Fiona never questioned anything.

28:07.348 --> 28:08.380
     She never took the time

28:08.482 --> 28:11.500
      to ponder the impact
         of her actions.

28:11.602 --> 28:15.437
  Never gave a passing thought
     about those she hurt--

28:15.539 --> 28:21.276
           all just...
   petty obstacles in her path

28:21.379 --> 28:24.146
 to her base wants and desires.

28:24.248 --> 28:26.515
         My dear Delia,

28:26.617 --> 28:28.200
    you are not your mother,

28:28.302 --> 28:31.336
  you'll never be your mother,

28:31.439 --> 28:33.238
        and the truth is,

28:33.340 --> 28:37.309
 even if Fiona walked this earth
      for a thousand years,

28:37.411 --> 28:42.114
   she would be but a flicker,
      pale in the shadows,

28:42.216 --> 28:47.236
   while you light up the sky
   like a fiery conflagration.

28:47.338 --> 28:51.240
         We must invoke
       the Sacred Taking.

28:51.342 --> 28:54.109
  Let my powers pour into her.

28:54.211 --> 28:56.378
 It will accelerate the process.

28:56.480 --> 29:00.015
    I die so she can be born.

29:00.101 --> 29:02.134
         Don't be daft.

29:02.236 --> 29:04.069
      The coven needs you.

29:04.171 --> 29:06.271
           What coven?

29:06.373 --> 29:08.073
        Everyone is dead.

29:08.175 --> 29:11.276
  Michael is coming and there's
 nothing we can do to stop him.

29:11.378 --> 29:13.045
   We don't need to stop him.

29:13.147 --> 29:15.314
We simply need to buy some time.

29:22.440 --> 29:25.073
   Back in the dungeon again.

29:25.176 --> 29:27.443
 I had hoped to avoid the fetid
   aroma of pubescent warlocks

29:27.545 --> 29:29.144
      the rest of my life.

29:29.246 --> 29:30.345
I never thought we'd see the day

29:30.448 --> 29:32.281
          when we come
    to ask for help from men.

29:32.383 --> 29:35.134
  It might have been easier if
 you allowed me to kill myself.

29:35.236 --> 29:36.335
     Delia, don't even joke.

29:36.437 --> 29:39.104
      John Henry and Behold
       are potent allies.

29:39.206 --> 29:41.106
      Together we can slow
          Michael down

29:41.208 --> 29:44.076
      and give Mallory time
     to develop her powers.

29:53.537 --> 29:55.237
             Hello?

30:02.179 --> 30:04.346
   Weren't they expecting us?

30:08.269 --> 30:10.235
               ¶ ¶

30:35.079 --> 30:37.045

               ¶ ¶

31:12.516 --> 31:14.166
     You'll be glad to know

31:14.268 --> 31:16.168
     I've made arrangements
     with Mile High Escorts.

31:16.270 --> 31:18.337
        Roxy and Cricket
        will be reporting

31:18.439 --> 31:20.172
   to the G5 for your flight.

31:24.211 --> 31:25.210
         We can't accept
        your resignation.

31:25.312 --> 31:28.113
     Oh, I wasn't giving you
            a choice.

31:28.215 --> 31:30.115
   I can't work here anymore.

31:30.217 --> 31:32.067
   Well, that we can agree on.

31:33.504 --> 31:35.137
  You can't work for a company

31:35.239 --> 31:36.972
         if the company
    isn't going to be there.

31:37.074 --> 31:38.073
     Or most of the planet.

31:38.175 --> 31:40.142
         (all chuckling)

31:40.244 --> 31:41.343
   What are you talking about?

31:41.445 --> 31:44.012
      The world is ending,
          Ms. Venable.

31:44.114 --> 31:46.348
   In the next year or two...
      (imitates explosion)

31:46.450 --> 31:50.135
    It is all gonna be gone.

31:50.237 --> 31:52.070
        No more company.

31:52.172 --> 31:54.273
   -No more Roxy and Cricket.
        -(Venable laughs)

31:54.375 --> 31:56.308
        No more anything.

31:56.410 --> 31:58.944
             Oh, my.

31:59.046 --> 32:01.013
 -Are you trying to frighten me?
              -No.

32:01.115 --> 32:02.381
    We're trying to save you.

32:05.135 --> 32:07.436
              Okay.

32:07.538 --> 32:10.238
     But then why do you two
         know about it?

32:10.341 --> 32:12.307
  Maybe you should have a seat.

32:22.169 --> 32:24.136
          Ms. Venable,

32:24.204 --> 32:27.272
        have you heard of
         the Illuminati?

32:30.177 --> 32:33.412
  I remember seeing some silly
   show on The History Channel

32:33.514 --> 32:37.199
     about some secret group

32:37.301 --> 32:40.268
         that supposedly
      controlled the world.

32:40.371 --> 32:43.071
 It's not silly; it's fo' reals.

32:43.173 --> 32:45.007
        They had a little
      name change recently

32:45.109 --> 32:46.241
     for reasons of branding
          and whatnot.

32:49.446 --> 32:52.114
        -The Cooperative.
     -Sounds better, right?

32:52.216 --> 32:56.368
  The Cooperative is on top of
 this whole end-time situation.

32:56.470 --> 32:58.370
       And we have a plan.

32:58.472 --> 33:01.206
   We are going to be building
   these Outposts for people.

33:01.308 --> 33:05.110
        The right people,
   so that we can ride it out.

33:05.279 --> 33:07.112
           "Outposts."

33:07.214 --> 33:09.281
    Yeah, they're like these
       little sanctuaries.

33:09.383 --> 33:11.366
     But see, there's no one
        overseeing them.

33:11.468 --> 33:15.337
  They need someone in charge.

33:15.439 --> 33:21.243
    So, we were thinking that
      because you have been

33:21.345 --> 33:24.112
    so good about keeping us
        out of trouble...

33:24.214 --> 33:27.966
     (Jeff and Mutt chuckle)

33:28.068 --> 33:31.336
     ...that you would make
     a great Administrator.

33:33.507 --> 33:36.975
       You would be clear
       to pick and choose

33:37.077 --> 33:38.210
  how you want to run the show.

33:38.312 --> 33:40.912
  You're saying I could devise
          my own rules.

33:41.015 --> 33:42.948
      Who's gonna stop you?

33:43.050 --> 33:44.366
   You want to make people say
    the Pledge of Allegiance

33:44.468 --> 33:46.201
       in their underwear
         every morning?

33:46.303 --> 33:48.236
       Knock yourself out.
           (chuckles)

33:48.338 --> 33:49.971
    Ms. Venable, you wouldn't
         have to answer

33:50.074 --> 33:52.974
   to anybody about anything.

33:58.182 --> 34:00.999
            (exhales)
    This place is so strange.

34:01.101 --> 34:04.269
      Why would the world's
         wealthiest 0.1%

34:04.371 --> 34:07.305
     choose to wear so much
     flannel and Patagonia?

34:09.176 --> 34:12.277
      They think true power
  lies in not flaunting theirs.

34:12.379 --> 34:14.379
             Idiots.

34:14.481 --> 34:17.399
Well, I just hope I can pry them
away from their horseback riding

34:17.501 --> 34:21.303
    and hot yoga long enough
  to convince them to help me.

34:21.405 --> 34:23.138
    You got to be kidding me.

34:25.208 --> 34:28.110
    I'm just... I'm nervous.

34:28.212 --> 34:31.446
      Against all the odds,
you found your way to this place

34:31.547 --> 34:34.132
        and to the brink
   of fulfilling your destiny.

34:34.234 --> 34:37.002
    And those people in there
           are quaking

34:37.103 --> 34:39.905
    in their overpriced boots
    because they know they're

34:40.007 --> 34:41.940
   about to come face-to-face
      with true greatness.

34:42.042 --> 34:45.010
         You're the one
      they're waiting for.

34:45.112 --> 34:46.178
 They've all pledged their souls

34:46.280 --> 34:48.013
         to your father
       and to serving you.

34:48.114 --> 34:51.900
  And they're starving for you
      to show them the way.

34:52.002 --> 34:53.068
     It's time for you to do

34:53.170 --> 34:55.303
 what you were put on this earth
       to do: destroy it.

35:16.110 --> 35:20.078
        Esteemed members
       of The Cooperative.

35:20.180 --> 35:24.099
   World leaders, tech giants.

35:24.201 --> 35:29.137
          Media moguls
    and cultural influencers.

35:29.239 --> 35:34.109
   The rumors you've heard are
true: my name is Michael Langdon

35:34.211 --> 35:38.079
    -and I am the Antichrist.
           -(gasping)

35:38.182 --> 35:40.048
      (indistinct chatter)

35:42.102 --> 35:43.368
         (chatter stops)

35:51.078 --> 35:54.279
  Humanity is at a crossroads.

35:54.381 --> 35:58.099
   The world as it is today--

35:58.202 --> 36:03.038
    the poverty, the hunger,
       the greed and war--

36:03.140 --> 36:05.340
   it's no longer sustainable.

36:05.509 --> 36:08.376
        The time has come
    to wipe the slate clean.

36:08.478 --> 36:13.114
       Friends, it's time
       for the apocalypse.

36:14.301 --> 36:16.268
        (excited chatter)

36:17.437 --> 36:20.438
 I understand your trepidation.

36:20.541 --> 36:23.375
      But let me remind you
        that you are here

36:23.477 --> 36:26.244
      because of the gifts
 bestowed upon you by my father.

36:26.346 --> 36:31.132
     In return, you gave him
      your immortal souls.

36:31.235 --> 36:33.235
          He owns you.

36:33.337 --> 36:37.038
      Therefore, I own you.

36:37.140 --> 36:41.109
     We speak with one voice
     and my demands are his.

36:41.211 --> 36:43.345
       Now, as you'll see
      from the handy guide

36:43.447 --> 36:46.114
    provided by my associate,
         I do not intend

36:46.216 --> 36:49.000
          to leave you
    and your families to die.

36:49.102 --> 36:52.304
      When fire rains down
     on the unwashed masses,

36:52.406 --> 36:55.974
      you and your families
 will be safely squirreled away

36:56.076 --> 36:59.344
          in a network
   of luxury fallout shelters.

36:59.446 --> 37:01.413
 You already have the resources.

37:05.068 --> 37:08.103
     You just bought land on
   New Zealand's South Island.

37:08.205 --> 37:11.373
   You own half of Bora Bora.

37:14.144 --> 37:16.444
      The bunker underneath
       your ranch in Texas

37:16.546 --> 37:18.446
   could easily fit 20 people.

37:18.548 --> 37:23.268
   With a little construction
     and some retrofitting,

37:23.370 --> 37:26.071
           these sites
 will make the perfect outposts

37:26.173 --> 37:28.206
           to ride out
      the end of the world.

37:28.308 --> 37:31.076
  And with the admission price
        of $100 million,

37:31.178 --> 37:33.245
         only the worthy
      will gain admission.

37:36.416 --> 37:40.368
 Turn to page six, section one.

37:40.470 --> 37:43.071
     "Outpost Construction."
