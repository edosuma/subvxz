WEBVTT

00:00.368 --> 00:01.936
Only on Fox.

00:05.940 --> 00:07.508
(laughs)

00:07.542 --> 00:09.910
I had a great time
with you last night.

00:09.944 --> 00:13.681
Well, this morning
wasn't too bad, either.

00:13.714 --> 00:16.684
-Don't you forget to hydrate.
-(chuckles)

00:17.985 --> 00:20.455
Those are your friends
over there?

00:20.488 --> 00:22.823
(squeaky grunting)

00:24.892 --> 00:28.162
I've never seen them before
in my life.

00:28.195 --> 00:30.498
No, Hank.
For the last time.

00:30.531 --> 00:33.167
This is the signal for "W."

00:33.200 --> 00:35.336
This is the signal for "P."

00:38.306 --> 00:39.840
Wait, what's that
the signal for?

00:39.874 --> 00:42.643
Oh, I don't know. It's just
something weird my arm does.

00:42.677 --> 00:45.480
Don't even tell me
what you guys are doing.

00:45.513 --> 00:47.181
I don't want to know.

00:47.214 --> 00:48.816
If you must know, Margaret,

00:48.849 --> 00:50.651
I got to pass this eye test

00:50.685 --> 00:53.153
so I can renew my license
for my golf cart.

00:53.187 --> 00:54.555
So to make sure
I'm gonna pass it,

00:54.589 --> 00:55.923
we runnin' a little scam.

00:55.956 --> 00:58.025
To be real,
the eye test is the scam.

00:58.058 --> 01:00.027
It's Western medicine, man.

01:00.060 --> 01:02.129
You know, the government
designed this test

01:02.162 --> 01:04.164
-to make our eyes worse.
-MARGARET: Mm.

01:04.198 --> 01:05.900
But you're wearing glasses
right now.

01:05.933 --> 01:09.337
Yeah, I know.
I am a victim of it myself.

01:09.370 --> 01:11.038
But think about this.

01:11.071 --> 01:13.508
What are glasses made of?

01:13.541 --> 01:15.075
Glass.

01:17.044 --> 01:18.913
And what is glass made of?

01:18.946 --> 01:20.381
Sand.

01:20.415 --> 01:22.417
And where does sand come from?

01:22.450 --> 01:24.885
The Middle East.

01:26.421 --> 01:28.923
I'm not getting glasses.

01:28.956 --> 01:31.326
That's the first stop
on the road to death.

01:32.760 --> 01:34.729
Hank, just don't drive
a golf cart.

01:34.762 --> 01:36.497
You could use the steps.

01:36.531 --> 01:38.533
(both laughing)

01:38.566 --> 01:41.869
"Just don't drive a golf cart."

01:41.902 --> 01:43.904
(laughing)

01:43.938 --> 01:44.939
Ah...

01:44.972 --> 01:46.507
(softly):
Margaret.

01:48.042 --> 01:50.411
The dating scene
at Shady Meadows is a pyramid.

01:50.445 --> 01:52.780
At the top of the pyramid,
that's the stallions--

01:52.813 --> 01:54.148
they have the golf carts.

01:54.181 --> 01:55.483
-Right.
-At the bottom,

01:55.516 --> 01:57.785
those are the walkers,
the slugs.

01:57.818 --> 01:59.420
Me, I'm a stallion.

01:59.454 --> 02:02.790
I crush those slugs
under my thundering hooves.

02:02.823 --> 02:05.726
Mm. The thundering hooves
of your golf cart.

02:05.760 --> 02:07.562
-That's right.
-Boy.

02:07.595 --> 02:10.631
Is there anybody normal around
here I can have breakfast with?

02:10.665 --> 02:12.367
Howdy, folks.

02:12.400 --> 02:15.135
Boy, it's a nice day
to drink beer,

02:15.169 --> 02:18.673
watch football and...
not have sex with men.

02:20.941 --> 02:23.344
Did y'all buy that?

02:25.846 --> 02:27.848
*

02:47.835 --> 02:49.670
What is going on, Sid?

02:49.704 --> 02:51.639
My son Walt just told me

02:51.672 --> 02:53.207
he's dropping by for a visit.

02:53.240 --> 02:55.443
In an hour, Margaret. An hour.

02:55.476 --> 02:57.512
Well, what is wrong with that?

02:57.545 --> 03:01.416
Why are you dressed
like Woody from Toy Story?

03:01.449 --> 03:04.485
I'm trying to dress
like a straight person,

03:04.519 --> 03:07.154
because Walt
does not know I'm gay.

03:07.187 --> 03:09.356
(laughing)

03:09.390 --> 03:11.926
Wait a minute.

03:11.959 --> 03:14.695
You're not out to your son?
How could he not know?

03:14.729 --> 03:16.831
I see the struggle that
you're having there, Margaret.

03:16.864 --> 03:18.833
It's a struggle that
we've all had ourselves.

03:18.866 --> 03:20.801
-Yep.
-Now, what we've landed on--

03:20.835 --> 03:22.670
and no offense, Sid--
is that, um,

03:22.703 --> 03:24.872
that boy's just not bright.

03:24.905 --> 03:26.774
Wait.

03:26.807 --> 03:29.143
I-I'm just still trying
to wrap my head around the fact

03:29.176 --> 03:31.178
that somebody could see you
and know you

03:31.211 --> 03:33.347
and think that you're straight.

03:33.380 --> 03:35.315
Kids just believe their dads.

03:35.349 --> 03:37.051
You know, I get the dad thing.

03:37.084 --> 03:39.219
I always thought my dad
was a rich dentist.

03:39.253 --> 03:43.123
Turns out he was
just the guy that shot JFK.

03:45.292 --> 03:49.396
Well, as great
as Charlie's example is, I...

03:49.430 --> 03:53.033
I still think you should just
try telling your son the truth.

03:53.067 --> 03:55.102
I can't. I can't.

03:55.135 --> 03:57.404
I've lied to him
his entire life.

03:57.438 --> 03:58.706
If I told him the truth
right now,

03:58.739 --> 04:01.075
it would blow up
our entire relationship.

04:01.108 --> 04:02.977
He'd be shattered.

04:03.010 --> 04:05.613
Just shattered to smithereens.

04:07.114 --> 04:09.149
He really doesn't know?

04:10.918 --> 04:13.721
Okay, Walt's gonna be here
in 30 minutes.

04:13.754 --> 04:15.856
I removed all the gay stuff
from my room.

04:15.890 --> 04:17.658
Tell me if I missed anything.

04:24.098 --> 04:25.900
I'd say you missed everything.

04:28.503 --> 04:30.538
*

04:30.571 --> 04:35.042
Okay, this couch looks
pretty straight to me.

04:35.075 --> 04:36.744
One second.

04:37.778 --> 04:39.446
-Oh!
-There.

04:39.480 --> 04:41.448
Perfect.

04:41.482 --> 04:43.951
And I brought you a bunch of
straight guy stuff from my room,

04:43.984 --> 04:45.152
so you could hang it up here.

04:45.185 --> 04:47.287
I'm giving you
my football phone.

04:48.823 --> 04:51.058
My bikini girl poster.

04:54.795 --> 04:57.732
And, uh...
Charles Barkley cologne.

04:57.765 --> 05:01.301
Don't get this on your skin;
this is clothes only.

05:01.335 --> 05:04.572
Am I pretending to be a straight
man or a 15-year-old boy?

05:04.605 --> 05:07.174
If you figure out
the difference, let me know.

05:07.207 --> 05:10.745
Now, I got to look and see that
there's football all weekend

05:10.778 --> 05:12.880
so we can sail through
till Sunday.

05:12.913 --> 05:15.215
Yeah, or here's a crazy thought.

05:15.249 --> 05:17.384
You could maybe
just communicate with your son.

05:17.417 --> 05:20.220
(laughter)

05:20.254 --> 05:23.123
Margaret. Communication
between fathers and sons

05:23.157 --> 05:25.993
is a series of nods and grunts

05:26.026 --> 05:29.797
and decade-long bouts
of silence.

05:29.830 --> 05:32.800
My dad gave me a grunt
of approval once, and I wept.

05:32.833 --> 05:35.435
Later on, by myself, in the dark
so he couldn't see me.

05:35.469 --> 05:37.938
(Charlie grunts)

05:37.972 --> 05:39.807
Thank you, Charlie.

05:41.175 --> 05:43.510
You know what?
I want no part of this.

05:43.544 --> 05:45.713
I'm just gonna go back
to my room

05:45.746 --> 05:49.516
and try not to think about what
Hank has done to that poster.

05:52.319 --> 05:55.856
What'd you do to that poster?

05:55.890 --> 05:59.860
I don't do it to the poster,
I do it to myself.

05:59.894 --> 06:01.862
-(doorbell rings)
-Oh, he's here!

06:01.896 --> 06:04.098
He's here. He's here.

06:04.131 --> 06:05.600
I mean, uh...

06:05.633 --> 06:07.367
let's get ready
to rock and roll, people.

06:08.636 --> 06:11.371
-Walt.
-What's up, Pop?

06:11.405 --> 06:14.208
-Oh, my little man!
-(grunts, laughs)

06:14.241 --> 06:15.676
BOTH:
Ho, ho, ho!

06:15.710 --> 06:18.345
Ha-ha! How are
Tammy and the boys?

06:18.378 --> 06:21.115
Oh, Tammy's good, and the boys
bite each other a lot.

06:21.148 --> 06:23.117
-It's hilarious.
-(laughs)

06:23.150 --> 06:25.319
-Oh, you fellas must be...
-I'm Charlie.

06:25.352 --> 06:26.320
...Charlie and Hank.

06:26.353 --> 06:27.855
-Yeah.
-How are you?

06:27.888 --> 06:29.423
We must be.

06:29.456 --> 06:31.525
Walt, what's
with the surprise visit?

06:31.558 --> 06:33.594
Well, I came to see
where you live.

06:33.628 --> 06:36.563
And see who your friends are,
what your life's like.

06:36.597 --> 06:38.999
You keep making excuses
for why I can't visit you,

06:39.033 --> 06:40.901
so I decided to come on my own.

06:40.935 --> 06:42.269
Plus, it's the big game.

06:43.537 --> 06:45.039
-The Cowboys.
-Oh, the Cowboys!

06:45.072 --> 06:46.674
The Dallas Cowboys!
I love 'em!

06:46.707 --> 06:49.343
They're the tits!
Which I also love.

06:50.611 --> 06:51.979
You caught
last week's game, right?

06:52.012 --> 06:53.714
You see all those sacks
our boys got?

06:53.748 --> 06:57.317
Oh, did I ever! It was
Sacks Fifth Avenue out there.

06:57.351 --> 06:59.153
Oh! (laughs)

06:59.186 --> 07:00.387
(fake laughing)

07:00.420 --> 07:01.756
Hilarious as always, Dad.

07:01.789 --> 07:03.257
Well, park it, buster.

07:03.290 --> 07:04.692
Let's watch some football.

07:04.725 --> 07:06.593
I'm gonna sit
right on these chips,

07:06.627 --> 07:08.696
'cause it
doesn't bother me at all.

07:12.466 --> 07:13.668
(grunts):
Yeah.

07:13.701 --> 07:15.069
-(grunts): Yeah.
-Yeah.

07:15.102 --> 07:17.805
BOTH:
Mm-hmm.

07:20.574 --> 07:22.376
Whose kimono is this?

07:22.409 --> 07:24.111
Mi...

07:24.144 --> 07:26.013
My, my, my.

07:26.046 --> 07:28.783
Well, whose is it?

07:28.816 --> 07:30.150
Whose is it?

07:30.184 --> 07:32.720
Whose is it? Whose?
Whose, indeed.

07:32.753 --> 07:35.422
Well, well, isn't that the, um,
doesn't belong to that, uh,

07:35.455 --> 07:38.192
babe you been hooking up with?
You know, the hot babe.

07:38.225 --> 07:40.094
That's right. That's right.

07:40.127 --> 07:43.063
It's a... it's
a beautiful lady's kimono.

07:43.097 --> 07:45.432
She took it off
for the intercourse.

07:47.034 --> 07:49.670
It's all comin' back to me now.

07:51.105 --> 07:52.572
-Hmm?
-Mm.

07:52.606 --> 07:55.943
BOTH:
We got to go take an eye test.

07:57.945 --> 08:00.247
Dad, you're seeing someone?

08:00.280 --> 08:02.116
That's great!

08:02.149 --> 08:05.085
I mean, I haven't heard you talk
about a woman since Mom.

08:05.119 --> 08:07.487
Well, that's true--
I haven't touched a woman

08:07.521 --> 08:09.023
since your mother.

08:10.691 --> 08:12.760
Uh, let's get back
to football. Want to?

08:12.793 --> 08:15.763
-I love football. Mm-hmm.
-No, hang on, Dad.

08:15.796 --> 08:17.397
Who is this woman?

08:17.431 --> 08:19.133
Tell me more about her.

08:19.166 --> 08:22.837
Well, as you probably gathered
from the kimono, uh...

08:22.870 --> 08:24.638
she's Japanese.

08:25.940 --> 08:28.442
Of, uh, royal blood.

08:28.475 --> 08:30.911
But she's very down-to-earth.

08:30.945 --> 08:32.947
She's actually worked
in the earth.

08:32.980 --> 08:34.114
Uh...

08:34.148 --> 08:36.416
she's a coal miner.

08:36.450 --> 08:37.985
Wow.

08:38.018 --> 08:40.020
She sounds like
an incredible woman.

08:40.054 --> 08:41.521
What's her name?

08:41.555 --> 08:43.523
Her name?

08:43.557 --> 08:46.226
Uh, uh, her name, uh...

08:47.094 --> 08:48.628
Oh. Margaret!

08:48.662 --> 08:49.930
Yeah. Me, Margaret.

08:49.964 --> 08:51.298
I forgot my purse.

08:51.331 --> 08:52.767
You also forgot your kimono.

08:53.734 --> 08:54.869
Walt, meet Margaret,

08:54.902 --> 08:56.737
my royal Japanese...

08:56.771 --> 08:58.572
coal-mining lover.

09:11.218 --> 09:13.954
I cannot believe
that I agreed to this.

09:13.988 --> 09:16.056
I'm sorry.
I tried to get us out of it,

09:16.090 --> 09:17.892
but he insisted on lunch.

09:17.925 --> 09:20.961
Just so you know, I don't
approve of any of this at all.

09:20.995 --> 09:23.563
And you're gonna do
my income taxes this year.

09:23.597 --> 09:28.302
Well, that shouldn't be hard--
I think I can add zero to zero.

09:28.335 --> 09:30.670
You really want
to insult me right now?

09:30.704 --> 09:33.340
I'm sorry,
I'm just a Stressy Bessy.

09:33.373 --> 09:36.276
All right,
just bring me up to speed

09:36.310 --> 09:39.246
on all this nonsense
you've spewed.

09:39.279 --> 09:42.382
So I'm a...
Japanese coal miner?

09:42.416 --> 09:46.020
A royal Japanese coal miner.

09:46.053 --> 09:49.156
Oh. That makes much more sense.

09:49.189 --> 09:52.526
I had a kimono in my hand
and a gun to my head.

09:52.559 --> 09:54.428
I was free-associating.

09:54.461 --> 09:56.596
At least you're interesting now.

09:57.631 --> 09:59.099
Sorry. Sorry.

09:59.133 --> 10:01.468
Uh, sorry about that.

10:01.501 --> 10:03.037
Tammy was just checking in.

10:03.070 --> 10:05.705
The boys set off a firecracker
in the toilet.

10:05.739 --> 10:07.107
And I'm pissed.

10:07.141 --> 10:09.576
I mean, you hate to miss
the important stuff.

10:11.711 --> 10:14.548
All right, stick to the story
and don't add anything.

10:14.581 --> 10:17.617
-Got it.
-So, let's get
to know each other.

10:17.651 --> 10:19.453
Where'd y'all meet?

10:19.486 --> 10:21.321
-Here.
-The bayou.

10:25.125 --> 10:27.527
(whispering):
Margaret. Margaret.

10:27.561 --> 10:30.164
Margaret, I think my dad
wants to talk to you

10:30.197 --> 10:32.266
underneath the table.

10:38.572 --> 10:41.708
Why did I say bayou?

10:41.741 --> 10:44.778
I was gonna ask you
the same question.

10:44.811 --> 10:47.714
Well, what should we do?

10:47.747 --> 10:50.017
Not this.

10:52.452 --> 10:54.688
Well, yeah, uh, we met here.

10:54.721 --> 10:57.657
When I said "bayou,"
I-I meant "by you."

10:57.691 --> 11:01.896
Of course, I was referring to
you, being Margaret, my lover.

11:01.929 --> 11:03.730
I love you, baby.

11:04.865 --> 11:07.101
We're back on track.

11:12.506 --> 11:15.442
Hank!
Hear you might need glasses.

11:15.475 --> 11:18.178
Pretty soon,
you're gonna look as cool as me.

11:18.212 --> 11:19.779
Take a hike, Dudley.

11:21.481 --> 11:23.050
I hope this works.

11:23.083 --> 11:24.484
How am I supposed
to pass this stupid eye test?

11:24.518 --> 11:26.520
I stole the shock collar

11:26.553 --> 11:28.722
from Betsy Donahue's Pomeranian.

11:28.755 --> 11:32.526
Put it in your pocket, and
I will buzz you for each letter.

11:32.559 --> 11:34.828
One for "A," two for "B"...

11:34.861 --> 11:36.096
That's beautiful, Charlie.

11:36.130 --> 11:38.498
Yeah, I'm not done.
Three for "C"...

11:38.532 --> 11:40.467
Yeah, I-I got it, and I love it.

11:40.500 --> 11:43.137
This stallion's about
to be set loose. (laughs)

11:43.170 --> 11:46.006
By renewing his license
to drive an electric golf cart.

11:46.040 --> 11:48.008
-See?
-(whinnies)

11:48.042 --> 11:49.609
Yeah, you hear that?

11:49.643 --> 11:51.111
That's the sound of freedom.

11:51.145 --> 11:54.314
Horse freedom.
(sputters)

11:54.348 --> 11:56.316
What's up, guys?
I'm Dr. Chad.

11:56.350 --> 11:59.486
Oh, another mindless disciple
of Western medicine.

11:59.519 --> 12:02.689
Nice to meet you, "Doctor" Chad.

12:02.722 --> 12:05.825
We're here
for the, uh... "eye" test.

12:05.859 --> 12:08.328
Does he need to be here?

12:08.362 --> 12:10.364
Do yo need to be here?

12:10.397 --> 12:14.034
Okay, Hank,
let's start with the top line.

12:14.068 --> 12:17.437
If you don't pass this test,
I will be shocked.

12:17.471 --> 12:19.139
(both laugh)

12:19.173 --> 12:21.241
All right, then I'm gonna

12:21.275 --> 12:23.377
start on the...
(clears throat) ...top line

12:23.410 --> 12:24.878
with that big one right there.

12:24.911 --> 12:26.280
-And it is...
-(buzzer sounds)

12:26.313 --> 12:28.215
Ooh! Geez. "A"?

12:28.248 --> 12:31.118
Correct.

12:31.151 --> 12:34.188
(quietly):
How big is that Pomeranian?

12:34.221 --> 12:37.691
So, I told my, um,

12:37.724 --> 12:39.926
coal miner, uh, foreman

12:39.960 --> 12:42.329
that, uh,

12:42.362 --> 12:46.700
just because my dad is
the emperor, um...

12:46.733 --> 12:50.504
it doesn't mean that
I should get special attention.

12:53.040 --> 12:56.243
Isn't... she... amazing?

12:58.078 --> 13:00.814
Wow.
That is an incredible story.

13:02.082 --> 13:04.451
Margaret, I-I got to say,
and-and forgive me

13:04.484 --> 13:06.620
if I'm speaking out of turn,
but...

13:06.653 --> 13:09.623
you do not look
particularly Japanese.

13:09.656 --> 13:12.993
Walt, I didn't raise you
like that.

13:15.795 --> 13:18.032
No, that's fine.
I get it all the time.

13:18.065 --> 13:20.534
Actually, I'm only,
uh, half Japanese.

13:20.567 --> 13:21.968
-Yeah.
-Which half?

13:22.002 --> 13:23.970
Uh... the...

13:24.004 --> 13:25.939
the bottom half.

13:35.282 --> 13:37.284
Neat.

13:37.317 --> 13:41.288
Well, it seems like lunch has
come to a natural conclusion,

13:41.321 --> 13:44.424
so, how about we catch
that Cowboys game?

13:44.458 --> 13:46.726
Well, that's my cue to leave,
because I hate football.

13:46.760 --> 13:48.628
It was really nice
to meet you, Walt.

13:48.662 --> 13:50.264
-ROBERT: Here you are, sexy.
-MARGARET: Oh!

13:54.768 --> 13:56.770
I've been looking everywhere
for you.

13:56.803 --> 13:59.139
(laughing): Oh, Robert,
this is not a good time.

13:59.173 --> 14:02.109
Uh, oh, maybe later, then.

14:02.142 --> 14:03.943
I'm up until 9:00.

14:03.977 --> 14:05.979
Ah.

14:07.481 --> 14:09.015
Dad, what's going on?

14:09.049 --> 14:11.151
Uh... yeah,

14:11.185 --> 14:13.920
is there something going on
between you two?

14:13.953 --> 14:17.057
Well, we're-we're trying not
to put any labels on it, Sid,

14:17.091 --> 14:19.659
you know, except for one--
uh, "wow."

14:23.963 --> 14:26.166
This isn't what it looks like,
Walt.

14:26.200 --> 14:28.368
Shouldn't you be saying that
to my dad?

14:28.402 --> 14:32.139
This is not what
it looks like, Sid.

14:32.172 --> 14:33.707
The hell it isn't!

14:33.740 --> 14:36.743
You two are running around,
'hind my back.

14:36.776 --> 14:38.812
Sid, what are you talking about?

14:38.845 --> 14:41.181
I mean, what-what do you care
if I go out with Margaret?

14:41.215 --> 14:42.882
What-what does he care?!

14:42.916 --> 14:44.684
He cares
because Margaret's his woman.

14:44.718 --> 14:46.553
(laughs)

14:48.988 --> 14:52.826
That-that...
that's, uh, impossible.

14:52.859 --> 14:56.230
-Why?
-Why? Well, because Sid's...

14:56.263 --> 14:59.666
You say one more word, Robert,
and I'll knock your block off!

14:59.699 --> 15:02.702
Don't you make me get up
on this chair.

15:02.736 --> 15:05.405
We-we really should go, Robert.

15:05.439 --> 15:08.342
And Sid, bye.
We'll always have Tokyo.

15:08.375 --> 15:09.909
Oh, no.

15:09.943 --> 15:11.845
You best go on and git!

15:11.878 --> 15:13.713
And don't you ever come back.

15:13.747 --> 15:15.215
You ruined my life.

15:15.249 --> 15:17.016
You ruined it!

15:19.119 --> 15:22.021
She'll come crawling back.

15:22.055 --> 15:24.624
They always do.

15:31.265 --> 15:33.233
-(buzzer sounds)
-Ooh!

15:33.267 --> 15:34.801
(panting)

15:34.834 --> 15:36.870
"H"?

15:39.072 --> 15:42.041
Okay. Took a while,
but that's right and next?

15:42.075 --> 15:44.378
-(buzzer sounds repeatedly)
-Ooh! Oh!

15:44.411 --> 15:46.780
Ooh! Ooh!

15:46.813 --> 15:48.882
(groaning)
"E."

15:48.915 --> 15:50.850
Sorry, Hank.
That was actually...

15:50.884 --> 15:52.752
-(buzzer sounds)
-Oh! I mean "F".

15:53.987 --> 15:56.890
Are you okay?

15:56.923 --> 15:58.925
Why do I keep smelling
burnt hair?

16:00.760 --> 16:03.630
Seems like the sort of thing
a real doctor would know.

16:05.765 --> 16:08.735
Come on, man.
Let's keep going.

16:08.768 --> 16:12.206
Okay. Just 24 more to go.
And next?

16:12.239 --> 16:13.473
-(buzzer sounding repeatedly)
-Ooh! Ooh!

16:13.507 --> 16:15.209
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!

16:15.242 --> 16:17.577
All right, this is too much.
I can't take it, man.

16:17.611 --> 16:19.145
Enough!

16:19.179 --> 16:20.980
Is that Pomeranian still alive?

16:21.014 --> 16:22.549
We got to go save that dog.

16:24.218 --> 16:26.820
You guys were trying to cheat
on the eye exam?

16:26.853 --> 16:28.422
(laughs)

16:28.455 --> 16:31.124
Well, neither of you
will be getting a lollipop.

16:31.157 --> 16:33.760
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

16:33.793 --> 16:35.995
Can't you just pass me, man?

16:36.029 --> 16:37.631
Sorry. I took an oath.

16:37.664 --> 16:39.833
What if I gave you $200?

16:41.134 --> 16:43.102
Works for me.

16:43.136 --> 16:45.272
Here.

16:45.305 --> 16:47.474
What about your "precious oath"?

16:47.507 --> 16:51.177
I oath the bank 100 grand
in student loans.

16:51.211 --> 16:53.280
You're doing the right thing.

16:53.313 --> 16:55.715
You made this stallion
very happy.

16:55.749 --> 16:57.784
(sputters)

17:00.520 --> 17:03.523
*

17:04.524 --> 17:05.892
I am so sorry

17:05.925 --> 17:08.628
about what just happened
with Margaret, Dad.

17:08.662 --> 17:09.996
Are you okay?

17:10.029 --> 17:12.065
Oh, I'm... I'm-I'm-I'm fine.

17:12.098 --> 17:14.133
Uh, easy come, easy go.

17:14.167 --> 17:16.270
'Nother day, 'nother ho.

17:22.041 --> 17:23.843
Dad, you don't have to pretend.

17:23.877 --> 17:25.345
You can be honest with me.

17:26.580 --> 17:28.448
I'll be honest with you.

17:28.482 --> 17:30.550
I'm worried about you.
That's why I'm really here.

17:30.584 --> 17:32.352
You never talk about your life.

17:32.386 --> 17:34.053
And are you happy?

17:34.087 --> 17:38.658
I... I am happy... Walt.

17:38.692 --> 17:40.059
Are you really?

17:40.093 --> 17:42.061
You just got cheated on.

17:42.095 --> 17:44.063
By the lower-half,
half-Japanese woman

17:44.097 --> 17:46.933
who's the heir
to the Japanese empire.

17:47.967 --> 17:50.437
Well, about all that...

17:50.470 --> 17:52.872
Um...

17:52.906 --> 17:54.874
I need to talk to you.

17:54.908 --> 17:56.876
I want to tell you something.

17:56.910 --> 18:00.414
Uh, you don't have to worry
about me, 'cause I'm happy.

18:00.447 --> 18:04.418
I'm really happy. I mean,
I think that I would be happier

18:04.451 --> 18:07.721
if you could see the real me,
because I'm...

18:07.754 --> 18:09.656
Sorry. What'd you say? I...

18:09.689 --> 18:11.725
I'm...

18:11.758 --> 18:13.893
I'm sorry, Dad.
I'm still not getting it.

18:13.927 --> 18:15.495
(loudly):
I... am... gay.

18:15.529 --> 18:16.963
Thanks for the newsflash, Sid.

18:16.996 --> 18:18.698
(groans):
Oh!

18:23.737 --> 18:25.739
Walt, I, um...

18:25.772 --> 18:28.107
I've always been gay,
and I'm... I'm really sorry

18:28.141 --> 18:31.010
that I kept it from you,
but I... like ice dancing

18:31.044 --> 18:35.849
and musical theater and...
making love to men.

18:35.882 --> 18:39.218
I suppose that last one's
the main takeaway.

18:42.422 --> 18:44.758
Wow.

18:44.791 --> 18:46.760
My dad is gay.

18:46.793 --> 18:48.728
I have a gay dad.

18:48.762 --> 18:51.097
That explains a lot.

18:51.130 --> 18:53.032
This is awesome.

18:53.066 --> 18:55.669
Oh, I'm happy for you, Pop.

18:55.702 --> 18:57.971
Oh, thank you. I'm so glad.

18:58.004 --> 18:59.406
I... Oh, I'm so relieved.

18:59.439 --> 19:01.975
I should have done this
years ago.

19:02.008 --> 19:05.244
But I must say, I was hoping
for a little dramatics.

19:05.278 --> 19:08.615
Some-some tears or a slow clap.

19:12.185 --> 19:14.988
Well, it's a little late
for that, Walter John.

19:15.021 --> 19:18.625
I'm glad you finally told me.

19:18.658 --> 19:23.096
-I love you, Dad.
-Oh, I love you, son.

19:23.129 --> 19:25.632
Oh, Sid, I broke up with Robert.

19:25.665 --> 19:27.667
You're-you're the one
that I really want.

19:27.701 --> 19:29.569
Come back with me to Japan.

19:32.338 --> 19:33.807
It's okay, Margaret.

19:33.840 --> 19:35.241
-I told him the truth...
-Oh.

19:35.274 --> 19:37.243
...and you buttoned
your sweater wrong.

19:37.276 --> 19:38.945
Oh. Huh. Oops.

19:38.978 --> 19:42.148
So, Robert
and I didn't really break up.

19:44.951 --> 19:46.986
I love this.

19:47.020 --> 19:49.355
I feel seen.

19:49.389 --> 19:51.858
You see the real me.

19:51.891 --> 19:55.061
-HANK: I can't see.
-CHARLIE: Brake, Hank! Brake!

19:59.132 --> 20:01.167
(Hank whoops)

20:01.200 --> 20:04.671
Well, I got
my golf cart license back.

20:04.704 --> 20:07.874
You drove into a building, man.

20:07.907 --> 20:11.277
Very stallion, Hank.

20:11.310 --> 20:13.747
-You guys okay?
-Oh, they're fine, Margaret.

20:13.780 --> 20:17.584
Hank, Charlie,
I have got some really big news.

20:17.617 --> 20:19.819
Now I have got even bigger news.

20:19.853 --> 20:21.955
Everybody, listen up.

20:21.988 --> 20:24.891
Now, this is very hard
for me to say,

20:24.924 --> 20:27.126
but I've been living a lie.

20:27.160 --> 20:29.529
And the truth is...

20:29.563 --> 20:31.698
(clears throat)
...I can't see.

20:31.731 --> 20:33.833
I need glasses.

20:33.867 --> 20:36.202
There, I said it.

20:36.235 --> 20:38.204
I...

20:38.237 --> 20:40.540
need glasses.

20:42.141 --> 20:44.678
How brave is this guy?

20:50.917 --> 20:53.620
Are you friggin' kidding me?

21:00.093 --> 21:01.461
Walt, you have been
through a lot this weekend, but

21:01.495 --> 21:03.897
can you handle
one more truth bomb?

21:03.930 --> 21:06.032
Another one?

21:06.065 --> 21:08.367
I actually
do not like the Dallas Cowboys.

21:08.401 --> 21:09.869
Whoa!

21:09.903 --> 21:11.738
Well, now.

21:11.771 --> 21:13.573
That's gonna take some time
to process.

21:13.607 --> 21:17.443
If it makes you feel any better,
I like cowboys in general.

21:17.477 --> 21:19.813
I guess that's just gonna have
to be enough.

21:19.846 --> 21:22.582
By the way, Dad,
I'm loving your real look.

21:22.616 --> 21:24.283
Yeah, you dress
just like the guy

21:24.317 --> 21:26.185
who runs the bake sale
at our church.

21:26.219 --> 21:29.022
(gasps)
Wait a second. Is he...?

21:29.055 --> 21:31.057
Oh, honey. He is.

21:31.090 --> 21:33.226
Captioning sponsored by
20th CENTURY FOX TELEVISION

21:33.259 --> 21:34.227
That's pretty good.

21:40.667 --> 21:42.702
You've made the cut
with The Cool Kids.
