WEBVTT

00:07.374 --> 00:10.377
( Cogliostro )
IT IS NOT JUST THE LOST
AND DISPOSSESSED

00:10.443 --> 00:13.313
THAT HAVE GATHERED
NEAR THE HELL SPAWN.

00:13.380 --> 00:18.785
THERE ARE THOSE LONE PREDATORS,
THE HUMAN MONSTERS.

00:19.152 --> 00:20.286
WANDA.

00:20.353 --> 00:21.788
Oh, Terry,

00:21.855 --> 00:23.923
WHERE ARE YOU ?

00:25.058 --> 00:27.827
HE TOLD ME
IT HAS TO BE THIS WAY.

00:37.937 --> 00:39.305
OH, NO !

00:40.607 --> 00:42.742
WHO ARE YOU ?
WHAT DO YOU WANT ?

00:42.809 --> 00:43.977
GET OUT OF THE CAR.

00:44.043 --> 00:45.178
OH, GOD.

00:51.618 --> 00:52.886
WANDA.

00:55.955 --> 00:57.090
AAH... !

00:57.357 --> 00:59.692
DO THINK OUR MASTER
WILL BE PLEASED ?

00:59.759 --> 01:01.494
WHY DON'T YOU
ASK HIM YOURSELF ?

01:01.561 --> 01:04.130
YOU'RE ABOUT
TO MEET HIM.

01:41.734 --> 01:43.069
NO !

02:07.694 --> 02:09.662
A PRAYER FOR THE DEAD.

02:09.729 --> 02:12.899
DOES IT EVER TRULY REACH
THE SOUL THAT IT'S MEANT FOR ?

02:12.966 --> 02:16.469
DO THEY ACTUALLY
HEAR OUR WISHES ?

02:17.637 --> 02:19.873
THIS IS A CANDLE
FOR AL SIMMONS,

02:19.939 --> 02:21.708
WHO PROBABLY WON'T
RECEIVE THIS PRAYER

02:21.774 --> 02:23.276
BECAUSE HIS SOUL

02:23.343 --> 02:25.945
IS NOW IN THE POSSESSION
OF HELL.

03:03.049 --> 03:06.553
( Sam )
THE PRESS IS GONNA
HAVE A FIELD DAY WITH THIS.

03:06.619 --> 03:09.055
I COUNTED THEM,
THERE WERE 12 PEOPLE

03:09.122 --> 03:11.591
SWINGING FROM
THE RAFTERS UP THERE.

03:11.658 --> 03:14.160
ONE OF THEM WAS THIS SICK FUCK
WHO DID ALL THE KILLING.

03:14.227 --> 03:16.696
LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE
DID US A FAVOR.

03:16.763 --> 03:19.232
( Twitch )
BUT WHO KILLED HIM ?
HE DIDN'T HANG<i> HIMSELF.</i>

03:19.299 --> 03:21.834
( Sam )
SO THERE'S ANOTHER PSYCHO
RUNNING AROUND OUT THERE.

03:21.901 --> 03:23.636
THE CITY'S
GOING TO HELL.

03:23.703 --> 03:25.705
WHAT TRIGGERS
THESE GUYS, ANYWAY ?

03:25.772 --> 03:27.674
KILLING ALL THOSE
INNOCENT PEOPLE.

03:27.740 --> 03:29.509
JESUS.

03:29.576 --> 03:32.612
( Twitch )
TWO OF THE VICTIMS
WERE AGENTS FROM THE NSC.

03:32.679 --> 03:35.081
( Sam )
NO WONDER THIS PLACE
IS CRAWLING WITH FEDS.

03:35.148 --> 03:36.983
WHAT THE HELL ?

03:41.854 --> 03:45.058
LADY, GET THAT CAR
OUT OF HERE !

03:45.124 --> 03:48.828
OKAY, YOU'RE CLEAR,
BACK HER UP.

03:56.135 --> 03:57.837
( Jason )
CHIEF BANKS,

03:57.904 --> 04:00.607
WANDA BLAKE WAS THE LAST PERSON
TO SEE MY AGENTS ALIVE.

04:00.673 --> 04:02.875
FIND HER,
FITZGERALD COULD BE WITH HER.

04:02.942 --> 04:05.945
MY PEOPLE ARE
COLLECTING THE BODIES.

04:06.012 --> 04:08.881
NOW, I WANT
THEIR IDENTITIES WITHHELD...

04:08.948 --> 04:11.484
AS FAR AS THE
PRESS IS CONCERNED,
THEY WERE NEVER THERE.

04:11.551 --> 04:13.820
TWO AGENTS SLAUGHTERED
AND PUT ON DISPLAY.

04:13.886 --> 04:15.455
AND ARE YOU READY
FOR<i> THIS</i> ?

04:15.521 --> 04:17.924
HE WAS THERE.

04:19.859 --> 04:22.762
FITZGERALD COULDN'T HAVE
DONE ALL THAT ALONE.

04:22.829 --> 04:24.931
OF COURSE HE COULDN'T.

04:24.998 --> 04:28.468
THIS IS GETTING TOO STRANGE,
AND COSTLY.

04:31.070 --> 04:34.073
... THAT WAS PRETTY...

04:39.879 --> 04:40.813
( sirens )

04:44.884 --> 04:46.252
OH, SHIT.

04:46.319 --> 04:48.154
LOOK OUT !

04:58.264 --> 05:01.668
DAMN, LADY, WHERE'D YOU
LEARN HOW TO DRIVE ?

05:01.734 --> 05:04.203
ABOUT KILLED ME
AND SHIT.

05:10.610 --> 05:12.512
( male )
HEY, YOU GUYS OKAY ?

05:12.578 --> 05:14.013
( male )
YEAH, WE'RE ALRIGHT.

05:14.080 --> 05:18.751
MAY I SEE YOUR DRIVER'S
LICENSE AND REGISTRATION ?

05:19.318 --> 05:21.487
( Merrick )
RAYMOND AND WATTS
WERE TORN APART

05:21.554 --> 05:23.523
AND THEN DRAGGED UP
SEVEN FLIGHTS OF STAIRS.

05:23.589 --> 05:24.857
THERE'S
A SECOND KILLER.

05:24.924 --> 05:25.692
WYNN.

05:25.758 --> 05:26.592
It's Banks.

05:26.659 --> 05:28.761
One of my cops just
pulled over Wanda Blake.

05:28.828 --> 05:30.496
She's a few blocks
from you.

05:30.563 --> 05:31.798
WHERE'S FITZGERALD ?

05:31.864 --> 05:33.066
No sign of him.

05:33.132 --> 05:34.500
What do we
do with her ?

05:34.567 --> 05:35.902
DO NOT DETAIN HER.

05:35.968 --> 05:38.838
FITZGERALD MUST
STILL BE IN THE AREA.

05:38.905 --> 05:41.107
FIND HIM NOW.

05:41.941 --> 05:45.712
( Merrick )
YOU KNOW, JASON,
SOMEONE'S OUT THERE.

05:47.180 --> 05:51.451
YOU MUST HAVE FRIENDS IN
PRETTY HIGH PLACES, MS. BLAKE.

05:51.517 --> 05:53.352
WHAT ?

05:53.419 --> 05:55.588
GO HOME, MA'AM...

05:56.856 --> 06:00.159
AND TRY NOT TO KILL ANYONE
GETTING THERE, OKAY ?

06:10.203 --> 06:14.173
( Spawn )
SHE WAS AFRAID OF ME.

06:15.475 --> 06:18.644
WHO ARE YOU BLAMING ?
HER, YOURSELF ?

06:18.711 --> 06:21.380
YOU CANNOT
HAVE THAT LIFE BACK.

06:21.447 --> 06:23.683
WHEN AL SIMMONS DIED,

06:23.750 --> 06:27.386
ALL HOPES OF A FUTURE
WITH WANDA DIED WITH HIM.

06:27.453 --> 06:31.057
YOU HAVE BEEN BORN
INTO ANOTHER EXISTENCE,

06:31.124 --> 06:34.360
A CHANCE TO REGAIN
YOUR HUMANITY.

06:34.427 --> 06:39.065
IT'S THERE, AND ONLY THERE,
WHERE YOUR CHOICES LIE.

06:40.133 --> 06:43.169
SHE'S SEEN THE CREATURE
I'VE BECOME.

06:43.236 --> 06:45.238
THAT'S ALL SHE KNOWS,

06:45.304 --> 06:47.640
HER ONLY MEMORY OF ME.

06:51.010 --> 06:55.481
THIS IS TRULY
WHAT HELL IS, OLD MAN.

06:55.548 --> 06:57.550
YOU HAVE
A CHANCE TO--

06:57.617 --> 07:00.219
A CHANCE ?!
WHAT CHANCE ?!

07:00.286 --> 07:02.421
I HAVE NOTHING
HERE ANYMORE !

07:02.488 --> 07:05.491
NO ESCAPE,
NOT EVEN DEATH !

07:08.528 --> 07:10.496
( Spawn groaning )

07:16.169 --> 07:19.672
YOU SEE ?
I CAN'T EVEN END IT !

07:23.910 --> 07:27.446
( Spawn )
I WOULD TRADE ANYTHING
TO DO MY LIFE OVER AGAIN

07:27.513 --> 07:30.449
IN THE WORLD'S
WORST SHIT HOLE,

07:30.516 --> 07:35.388
THAN TO BE HERE NOW,
LIKE THIS !

07:36.856 --> 07:40.059
( Cogliostro )
I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE GOING THROUGH,

07:40.126 --> 07:42.528
THE PAIN THAT
YOU'RE FEELING.

07:42.595 --> 07:44.964
HOW COULD YOU
POSSIBLY KNOW, OLD MAN ?

07:45.031 --> 07:48.668
BECAUSE I HAVE ENDURED IT
AND SURVIVED.

07:48.734 --> 07:51.037
DO YOU THINK
YOUR FATE IS SEALED ?

07:51.103 --> 07:53.506
ARE YOU GOING
TO ACCEPT THIS SHROUD

07:53.573 --> 07:55.608
THAT'S BEEN
PLACED AROUND YOU ?

07:55.675 --> 07:57.410
I CAN'T GO ON
LIKE THIS ANYMORE,

07:57.476 --> 07:59.812
HIDING IN
THE SHADOWS.

07:59.879 --> 08:01.314
I'M SICK OF IT.

08:01.380 --> 08:05.251
I HAVE TO LET HER
KNOW WHO I AM.

08:05.318 --> 08:07.954
HOW CAN YOU
TELL HER THAT...

08:08.020 --> 08:10.890
WHEN YOU DON'T
EVEN KNOW YOURSELF ?

08:19.131 --> 08:23.269
TOMORROW'S HEADLINES WILL BE:
"TRAITOR SHOOTS WIFE AND CHILD".

08:23.336 --> 08:25.438
AFTER ALL,
HE WAS DISTRAUGHT.

08:25.504 --> 08:27.306
YOU HAVE
FITZGERALD'S GUN ?

08:27.373 --> 08:29.175
YES,
AND HIS PRINTS, TOO.

08:29.242 --> 08:31.510
BANKS HAS EVERY COP IN BROOKLYN
LOOKING FOR FITZGERALD.

08:31.577 --> 08:33.512
WE SHOULD HAVE HIM
BY MORNING.

08:33.579 --> 08:36.449
I'D LIKE TO FINISH
THIS MYSELF.

08:37.350 --> 08:40.253
USE AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR,
SOMEONE OUTSIDE THE AGENCY.

08:40.319 --> 08:41.621
JASON...

08:41.687 --> 08:43.122
I SAID I'D DO IT.

08:43.189 --> 08:44.357
NO !

08:44.423 --> 08:46.893
MY BEST AGENTS ARE
COMING BACK IN BODY BAGS.

08:46.959 --> 08:49.195
SOMEONE IS OUT THERE
AND THEY'RE GETTING CLOSER.

08:49.262 --> 08:52.865
I WANT YOU TO FIND THEM,
MERRICK, BEFORE THEY FIND<i> ME.</i>

08:52.932 --> 08:54.100
YOU LOOK SPOOKED.

08:54.166 --> 08:57.069
I WON'T LET ANYTHING
HAPPEN TO YOU.

09:32.672 --> 09:34.440
HERE WE GO.

09:45.084 --> 09:46.652
PLEASE, MS. WU,

09:46.719 --> 09:48.921
SOME OF US WOULD
LIKE TO GO HOME.

09:48.988 --> 09:50.623
I'M ALMOST DONE.

09:50.690 --> 09:53.993
LAST TIME I DO<i> YOU</i> A FAVOR,
GODDAMNIT.

10:04.570 --> 10:06.372
INTERESTING.

10:06.439 --> 10:10.309
I THINK IT'S TIME I HAD
A TALK WITH WANDA BLAKE.

10:11.310 --> 10:13.846
THE SCENE IN BROOKLYN
IS PRETTY GRIM.

10:13.913 --> 10:16.115
WE HAVE ANOTHER MONSTER'S
HANDY WORK TO SORT OUT.

10:16.182 --> 10:18.150
THE MEDIA
HAS GONE APE SHIT,

10:18.217 --> 10:20.386
AND THE POLITICS
ON THIS ONE ?

10:20.453 --> 10:22.722
GENTLEMEN,
THE POLITICS ARE HEAVY.

10:22.788 --> 10:25.891
SO BAG AND TAG
<i>EVERYTHING...</i>

10:25.958 --> 10:27.226
BY THE BOOK.

10:27.293 --> 10:29.996
MAKE A NOTE OF EVERYTHING
THAT DOESN'T BELONG THERE.

10:30.062 --> 10:32.164
WE ARE WORKING
TWO MAJOR CRIME SCENES.

10:32.231 --> 10:34.400
WE HAVE SOME BADLY
DECOMPOSED BODIES

10:34.467 --> 10:36.268
IN THE ALLEYS
OFF 42nd STREET.

10:36.335 --> 10:39.238
MY GUESS,
THE MISSING DRUG DEALERS.

10:39.305 --> 10:41.941
ALRIGHT,
GO BE NEW YORK'S FINEST.

10:42.008 --> 10:44.710
( cop )
LET'S GET THIS GUY.

10:44.777 --> 10:47.813
EACH OF THOSE PINS REPRESENTS
A BODY FOUND IN THAT ALLEY.

10:47.880 --> 10:51.851
IT PISSES ME OFF THIS HAS
TO HAPPEN IN OUR PRECINCT.

10:51.917 --> 10:54.086
I ABSOLUTELY
AGREE, SIR.

10:54.153 --> 10:56.689
ABOUT FUCKING TIME
THEY'RE GOING INTO THOSE ALLEYS.

10:56.756 --> 10:58.591
I KNOW
SOMETHING'S IN THERE.

10:58.657 --> 11:00.493
HOW MANY REPORTS DO WE
HAVE TO WRITE, TWITCH ?

11:00.559 --> 11:02.161
TOO MANY, SIR.

11:02.228 --> 11:05.731
I'M SURE THE LOCALS
WILL APPRECIATE THEIR CONCERN.

11:06.899 --> 11:09.368
( male )
THIS PLACE IS
A GHOST TOWN.

11:09.435 --> 11:12.705
YOU SEE
ALL THOSE BODY BAGS ?

11:22.148 --> 11:25.651
PLEASE, HONEY,
WHERE ARE YOU ?

11:25.718 --> 11:27.420
WANDA...

11:41.400 --> 11:43.803
HEY, YOU,
OVER THERE !

11:43.869 --> 11:48.207
YES, OFFICER,
IS THERE A PROBLEM ?

11:48.274 --> 11:49.875
CAN I HELP YOU ?

11:49.942 --> 11:51.977
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING OUT HERE ?

11:52.044 --> 11:53.612
I WAS LOOKING FOR A PHONE
TO CALL MY WIFE.

11:53.679 --> 11:55.214
HE FITS
THE DESCRIPTION.

11:55.281 --> 11:57.283
THIS COULD BE OUR GUY,
SO BE CAREFUL.

11:57.349 --> 12:00.386
COULD YOU STOP SHINING THAT
LIGHT IN MY FACE, PLEASE ?

12:02.488 --> 12:04.590
EXCUSE ME, COULD YOU GET
THAT LIGHT OUT OF MY EYES ?

12:04.657 --> 12:06.392
CAN YOU TELL ME
WHERE THERE'S A PHONE ?

12:06.459 --> 12:07.993
I JUST CAN'T SEEM
TO FIND ONE THAT WORKS.

12:08.060 --> 12:09.662
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR CLOTHES ?

12:09.728 --> 12:12.264
BEEN FIGHTING ?
BEEN DRINKING, HUH ?

12:12.331 --> 12:14.700
IS THERE A LAW AGAINST
HAVING A DRINK ?

12:14.767 --> 12:17.169
I'M NOT DRIVING.

12:17.236 --> 12:18.237
SIR,

12:18.304 --> 12:21.507
YOU SEE ANYTHING UNUSUAL
IN THE LAST COUPLE OF HOURS ?

12:21.574 --> 12:23.409
"UNUSUAL" ?

12:23.476 --> 12:25.878
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
BY "UNUSUAL" ?

12:25.945 --> 12:28.581
HEAR ANY LOUD NOISES,
SCREAMS, SHOTS,

12:28.647 --> 12:30.549
ANYTHING OUT OF
THE ORDINARY ?

12:30.616 --> 12:33.185
NO, OTHERWISE I WOULD HAVE
CALLED THE COPS.

12:33.252 --> 12:35.354
MAY I SEE
SOME I.D., SIR ?

12:35.421 --> 12:37.289
I.D. ?

12:37.356 --> 12:40.326
YEAH, SURE,
RIGHT HERE.

12:40.392 --> 12:42.795
OH, MAN, I SEEM TO
HAVE LOST MY WALLET.

12:42.862 --> 12:45.531
UH, WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO
ASK YOU TO COME WITH US.

12:45.598 --> 12:47.666
I HAVEN'T
BROKEN ANY LAWS.

12:47.733 --> 12:51.003
JUST COME WITH US,
PLEASE.

12:51.070 --> 12:52.171
WHAT FOR ?

12:52.238 --> 12:53.939
I'M TELLING YOU,
I NEED TO CALL MY WIFE.

12:54.006 --> 12:55.808
SHE'LL COME GET ME.

12:55.875 --> 12:57.643
I HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING,
I WAS AT A BAR.

12:57.710 --> 12:59.178
WHAT BAR ?
WHERE ?

12:59.245 --> 13:01.180
IS THAT WHERE
YOU HAD THE FIGHT ?

13:01.247 --> 13:02.481
NO, NO.

13:02.548 --> 13:04.216
I JUST NEED
TO CALL MY WIFE.

13:04.283 --> 13:06.352
LIE DOWN
ON THE STREET !

13:06.418 --> 13:07.820
RIGHT NOW !

13:07.887 --> 13:11.123
HANDS OUT
AT YOUR SIDES, NOW !

13:29.308 --> 13:31.143
( phone )

13:38.484 --> 13:41.220
( recording )
Hi, this is Lisa,
sorry I can't take your call,

13:41.287 --> 13:43.789
but leave a message and I'll
call you back as soon as I can.

13:43.856 --> 13:44.890
( beeping )

13:44.957 --> 13:47.793
( male )
Lisa, I know you're there,
pick up.

13:47.860 --> 13:50.863
I'm so used to talking
to this damned thing anyway.

13:50.930 --> 13:54.533
Okay, I want you
to join the circus.

13:54.600 --> 13:56.902
This Brooklyn
serial killer story

13:56.969 --> 13:58.604
is gonna sell
a ton of papers.

13:58.671 --> 14:01.273
This guy was strung
up next to his victims,

14:01.340 --> 14:03.175
there's my front page.

14:03.242 --> 14:06.212
Stop covering that
dead-end alley story.

14:06.278 --> 14:09.048
Switch all your attention
over to this.

14:09.114 --> 14:13.118
I'M HUNTING
<i>ANOTHER</i> MONSTER.

14:13.185 --> 14:14.653
By the way...

14:14.720 --> 14:17.590
I got your compensation
for the deep throat

14:17.656 --> 14:19.792
you're working with
at the NSC.

14:19.858 --> 14:22.962
Someday, you'll have to
let me know who it is,

14:23.028 --> 14:27.800
must be somebody
pretty high up.

14:31.470 --> 14:34.073
( cop )
LET'S GO, LET'S GO,
MOVE THE CIVILIANS OUT.

14:34.139 --> 14:36.775
SET UP A PERIMETER,
AND DO IT NOW.

14:36.842 --> 14:38.544
NOW, FIVE MINUTES AGO...

14:38.611 --> 14:40.312
STEP BACK...

14:40.379 --> 14:43.315
( cop )
KEEP IT GOING,
MOVE IT ALONG...

14:43.382 --> 14:46.085
THERE'S NOTHING
TO LOOK AT...

14:49.488 --> 14:51.857
EXCUSE ME, MISS,
I CAN'T LET YOU DO THAT.

14:51.924 --> 14:54.260
BUT WHAT ARE
THEY LOOKING FOR ?

14:54.326 --> 14:56.128
I CAN'T TELL YOU THAT.

14:56.195 --> 14:58.197
NOW MOVE ALONG PLEASE,
IF YOU WOULD.

14:58.264 --> 15:00.466
THANKS FOR THE HELP.

15:01.900 --> 15:04.970
MAYBE THE LOCALS
KNOW SOMETHING.

15:22.521 --> 15:26.025
HEY, WHAT'S UP WITH THE GUYS
IN THE MOON SUITS, HUH ?

15:26.091 --> 15:30.329

THESE ALLEYS OF YOURS.

15:31.530 --> 15:33.999
WHAT DO YOU THINK
THEY'RE LOOKING FOR ?

15:34.066 --> 15:37.336
THEY'RE CLEANING UP THE TRASH
THAT TRIED TO FUCK WITH US.

15:37.403 --> 15:39.571
WE TOOK CARE OF BUSINESS,
'CAUSE THIS IS OUR HOME.

15:39.638 --> 15:41.006
( male )
SHUT UP, BOBBY.

15:41.073 --> 15:43.442
I'M A REPORTER FOR
"THE WASHINGTON POST".

15:43.509 --> 15:45.511
I COULD SURE USE A LEAD
ON THE STORY I'M WRITING.

15:45.577 --> 15:47.980
HEY, YOU LOOKING
TO HAVE A PARTY, LADY ?

15:48.047 --> 15:49.948

ABOUT ALL THE MURDERS

15:51.583 --> 15:53.152
HAPPENING IN
THESE ALLEYS ?

15:53.218 --> 15:55.721
YOU MUST HAVE
SEEN<i> SOMETHING.</i>

15:55.788 --> 15:56.922
IT'S KIND OF STRANGE

15:56.989 --> 15:58.924
HOW THEY ALL OCCURRED
IN THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS.

15:58.991 --> 16:00.726
THEY'RE ALL CONNECTED,
IS MY FEELING.

16:00.793 --> 16:02.027
COME ON,

16:02.094 --> 16:05.164
I'LL SHOW YOU SOMETHING
THAT YOU'RE GONNA LIKE.

16:10.235 --> 16:12.371
BOBBY,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING ?

16:12.438 --> 16:15.140
I WISH YOU'D KEEP
YOUR BIG MOUTH SHUT.

16:27.619 --> 16:29.388
GOODNIGHT,
SWEETHEART.

16:43.669 --> 16:45.304
( thundering )

16:46.205 --> 16:50.075
TERRY,
WHERE ARE YOU ?

16:53.212 --> 16:54.513
( phone )

16:56.648 --> 16:57.916
HELLO ?

16:57.983 --> 17:01.086
GOOD EVENING, WANDA,
IT'S JASON WYNN.

17:01.153 --> 17:02.588
ANY WORD
FROM TERRY ?

17:02.654 --> 17:05.023
NO, NO, NOTHING.

17:05.090 --> 17:07.993
Have you been
watching the news ?

17:08.060 --> 17:09.228
YES.

17:09.294 --> 17:13.232
THEY SAY THAT THERE IS
ANOTHER KILLER OUT THERE.

17:13.298 --> 17:15.367
YES, IT SEEMS
THAT THIS CITY

17:15.434 --> 17:17.603
HAS BECOME AN EVEN MORE
DANGEROUS PLACE TO LIVE.

17:17.669 --> 17:19.004
BY THE WAY,

17:19.071 --> 17:21.774
I'M POSTING SOMEONE OUTSIDE
YOUR HOUSE TO WATCH OVER YOU.

17:21.840 --> 17:23.542
Thank you, Jason.

17:23.609 --> 17:26.445
I'LL CALL TO CHECK ON YOU
IN THE MORNING.

17:27.646 --> 17:31.116
MAYBE TONIGHT YOU CAN
FINALLY GET SOME SLEEP.

17:32.451 --> 17:33.819
GOODNIGHT.

17:38.424 --> 17:42.995
THAT'S A HELL OF A STORY,
BUT I'M NOT BUYING IT.

17:45.063 --> 17:46.732
SHOW HER, GAR !

17:49.635 --> 17:53.439
BE GLAD TO GET THESE THINGS
OUT OF THE ALLEYS.

17:54.973 --> 17:56.942
WOW,
YOU WEREN'T KIDDING.

17:57.009 --> 17:59.278
WHERE DID YOU
GET THIS ?

17:59.344 --> 18:01.914
TAKE IT,
MAYBE WITHOUT THEM

18:01.980 --> 18:04.049
THERE'LL BE LESS PEOPLE
GETTING HURT.

18:04.116 --> 18:06.351
THESE MUST BE
THE MISSING WEAPONS

18:06.418 --> 18:08.120
THAT MY SOURCE
WAS TALKING ABOUT.

18:08.187 --> 18:09.621
ARE THERE ANY MORE ?

18:09.688 --> 18:11.256
MM-HMM.

18:11.323 --> 18:13.292
THERE'S MORE HID
AROUND HERE, TOO.

18:13.358 --> 18:15.260
I'LL SHOW YOU.

18:15.327 --> 18:19.364
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME
MORE ABOUT THIS "AL" GUY ?

18:20.432 --> 18:23.202
( tv )
But its most important feature,
it works, it burns fat.

18:23.268 --> 18:25.237
You'll trim inches
off your waist

18:25.304 --> 18:27.840
and those pesky saddlebags
will disappear, ladies.

18:27.906 --> 18:29.775
The FlexFlat
is here to help.

18:29.842 --> 18:32.711
In just weeks you're gonna
notice a difference...

22:05.791 --> 22:06.758
( gasping )

22:57.743 --> 23:01.847
WANDA, I JUST WANT TO
TALK TO YOU, PLEASE.

23:03.248 --> 23:06.585
I WOULD
NEVER HURT YOU.

23:07.652 --> 23:09.755
I ONLY WANT
TO PROTECT YOU.

23:09.821 --> 23:13.258
PLEASE,
I NEED HELP !

23:13.325 --> 23:15.160
WANDA, IT'S ME.

23:15.227 --> 23:17.262
IT'S ME, WANDA.

23:18.363 --> 23:20.198
LISTEN TO MY VOICE.

23:20.265 --> 23:22.734
I'M YOUR HUSBAND.

23:22.801 --> 23:25.704
YOU'RE LYING TO ME !

23:27.739 --> 23:29.207
YOU'RE THAT MONSTER !

23:29.274 --> 23:32.577
WHY ARE YOU MAKING
MY MOMMY CRY ?

23:40.185 --> 23:43.188
PLEASE, DON'T
HURT MY BABY !

23:43.255 --> 23:45.390
PLEASE,
DON'T HURT MY BABY !

23:45.457 --> 23:46.958
PLEASE...

23:48.527 --> 23:50.495
LEAVE HER ALONE.

24:03.909 --> 24:06.945
DON'T CRY, MOMMY.

24:08.346 --> 24:11.116
HE WON'T
HURT YOU.

24:15.153 --> 24:18.123
THAT WAS
THE SAD MAN.

24:21.760 --> 24:22.794
WHAT ?

24:22.861 --> 24:26.865
