00:02.470 --> 00:03.450
<i>Previously on</i> The Equalizer...

00:03.650 --> 00:04.980
You are Colton Fisk.

00:05.180 --> 00:07.090
And you are everything
Bishop always said you were.

00:07.290 --> 00:09.020
You're arrangement
with the Agency,

00:09.220 --> 00:10.020
it's under my
supervision now.

00:10.220 --> 00:11.190
You work for me.

00:11.390 --> 00:12.430
Your little playacting

00:12.630 --> 00:14.360
<i>got two good agents killed.</i>

00:14.560 --> 00:15.460
FISK:
<i>Everyone on that team</i>

00:15.660 --> 00:17.400
was guilty of something.

00:17.600 --> 00:18.700
What was I guilty of?

00:18.900 --> 00:20.030
FISK:
<i>Of getting Bishop killed.</i>

00:20.230 --> 00:21.330
<i>If not for you, McCall...</i>

00:21.530 --> 00:22.640
<i>Bishop is still alive today.</i>

00:22.840 --> 00:24.370
You wanted to see me,
here I am.

00:24.570 --> 00:25.600
Before you hear it
on the streets,

00:25.800 --> 00:27.940
I thought you should
hear it from me.

00:28.140 --> 00:29.580
I cut a deal with the D.A.

00:29.780 --> 00:31.040
So what do you need
from me?

00:31.240 --> 00:32.680
I want to meet your boys.

00:32.880 --> 00:33.980
My grandkids.

00:34.180 --> 00:35.710
Be a part of their lives.
I'm asking...

00:35.910 --> 00:39.540
will you give me the chance
to know my grandsons, Marcus?

00:43.310 --> 00:45.540
(indistinct chatter nearby)

00:48.210 --> 00:49.400
Hello, may I help you?

00:49.600 --> 00:51.560
I have an appointment
with Mr. Roth.

00:51.760 --> 00:53.070
Let's see.

00:53.270 --> 00:55.000
He has nothing scheduled.

00:55.200 --> 00:56.240
What is your name?

00:56.440 --> 00:58.320
It's okay.
I'll announce myself.

01:02.960 --> 01:04.010
WOMAN (in distance):
He's got a gun!

01:04.210 --> 01:05.010
(silenced gunshots)

01:05.210 --> 01:06.610
(people screaming)

01:06.810 --> 01:08.210
(panicked screaming,
more silenced gunshots)

01:08.410 --> 01:09.570
(thud)

01:10.300 --> 01:12.540
(screaming, gunshots continue)

01:20.480 --> 01:22.710
(panting)

01:24.480 --> 01:26.010
(pants)

01:40.460 --> 01:42.570
* *

02:09.760 --> 02:12.450
DELILAH: That was
so good, Auntie.

02:12.650 --> 02:13.710
Yeah, Auntie, I mean,

02:13.910 --> 02:15.150
you really outdid
yourself again.

02:15.350 --> 02:17.280
Mm.
Actually, this is one of
Trish's recipes.

02:17.480 --> 02:18.650
I'm gonna see her later.

02:18.850 --> 02:20.550
I will be sure
to tell her.
Oh, please do.

02:20.750 --> 02:22.160
Hey, baby girl,
what you got going on?

02:22.360 --> 02:23.320
Want to play some cards?

02:23.520 --> 02:24.760
Uh, I can't.

02:24.960 --> 02:26.960
I'm actually going to see
a movie with Jackson.

02:27.160 --> 02:30.630
Um, I'm also headed over to
Dad's for the weekend, so...

02:30.830 --> 02:32.700
Jackson?
From the boxing gym?

02:32.900 --> 02:34.030
Mm-hmm.
ROBYN:
Okay.

02:34.230 --> 02:35.770
Well, remember,
if he tries something,

02:35.970 --> 02:37.640
you block with the right
shoot the jab with the left--

02:37.840 --> 02:38.970
DELILAH:
Mom...
Oh, my God.

02:39.170 --> 02:40.610
You have got to stop--
DELILAH:
Uh, no.

02:40.810 --> 02:41.840
Baby, leave
those dishes alone.

02:42.040 --> 02:43.240
I'm not going out
until later.

02:43.440 --> 02:45.140
I got this.
Thank you, Auntie.

02:45.340 --> 02:48.050
(chuckling)
Love you.
Have fun. Love you. Be safe.

02:48.250 --> 02:49.350
Bye.

02:49.550 --> 02:50.950
Hey, what about you?

02:51.150 --> 02:52.020
What about me?

02:52.220 --> 02:54.190
Your social life
has been, what...

02:54.390 --> 02:56.690
How can I say this?
Nonexistent?

02:56.890 --> 02:57.990
(chuckling)
No, I was going to be

02:58.190 --> 03:00.060
a little bit more polite
and say "slow."

03:00.260 --> 03:02.260
What I got going on?
I got a lot of work to do.

03:02.460 --> 03:04.700
Well, there's more to life
than work, you know.

03:04.900 --> 03:06.060
At least, there should be.

03:06.270 --> 03:08.400
(phone chimes)
I'll keep that in mind.

03:08.600 --> 03:10.070
Speaking of,

03:10.270 --> 03:11.500
I got a meeting.

03:11.700 --> 03:13.140
Well, while you're setting
up these meetings,

03:13.340 --> 03:16.110
how about you set one with
that handsome Detective Dante?

03:16.310 --> 03:17.710
I don't know.

03:17.910 --> 03:19.480
Things have been
a little weird.

03:19.680 --> 03:21.650
I'm not exactly sure
where we stand.

03:21.850 --> 03:23.280
Well, you figure that out
by calling him.

03:23.480 --> 03:26.050
And who knows, maybe he'll
bring over his handcuffs.

03:26.250 --> 03:27.650
Auntie!
That's right.

03:27.850 --> 03:29.290
Don't you...
(laughs)

03:29.490 --> 03:30.790
I know you done
thought about it.
Goodbye, Aunt Vi.

03:30.990 --> 03:33.630
Don't even try.
(chuckling)
Bye.

03:33.830 --> 03:35.190
DEVON:
The screams,

03:35.390 --> 03:36.800
people I was working with
side by side for years...

03:37.000 --> 03:39.130
Oh, God,
there was so much blood.

03:39.330 --> 03:40.430
Okay, all right, Devon.

03:40.630 --> 03:41.700
Try to breathe.

03:41.900 --> 03:43.570
(breathing deeply)

03:43.770 --> 03:45.000
ROBYN:
There you go.

03:45.200 --> 03:47.470
You're safe now.
No, that's just it,
I'm not.

03:47.670 --> 03:49.040
As soon as I got
out of there,

03:49.240 --> 03:50.880
I didn't have my phone,
I left it at my desk, when--

03:51.080 --> 03:53.710
The point is, I ran to
the nearest police station,

03:53.910 --> 03:55.880
and he was there,
standing right outside.

03:56.080 --> 03:57.620
Who was there?
The killer.

03:57.820 --> 04:00.120
He knew I was alive.
He was waiting for me.

04:00.320 --> 04:01.420
Probably found your phone.

04:01.620 --> 04:03.460
Which means he knows
where I live.

04:03.660 --> 04:05.190
And where my mother
lives in Queens--

04:05.390 --> 04:07.530
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, look at me.
(hyperventilating)

04:07.730 --> 04:10.160
Look at me, look at me.

04:10.360 --> 04:11.860
I've got you.

04:12.060 --> 04:13.200
Okay?

04:13.400 --> 04:14.900
Now, I need you to think.

04:15.100 --> 04:17.770
Do you have any idea who'd want
to do something like this?

04:17.970 --> 04:20.070
Take out your entire office?

04:20.270 --> 04:21.710
No one.

04:21.910 --> 04:23.410
The company you work for,

04:23.610 --> 04:25.440
what exactly do they do?

04:25.640 --> 04:26.950
It's a research firm.

04:27.150 --> 04:29.210
We specialize in
marine biology.

04:29.420 --> 04:33.550
The environmental impacts
of a proposed operation.

04:33.750 --> 04:35.020
So, could it be
a corporate client?

04:35.220 --> 04:36.660
One that would lose
a lot of money

04:36.860 --> 04:38.660
if you turned in
an unfavorable report?

04:38.860 --> 04:40.630
No. We mostly work

04:40.830 --> 04:43.260
with places like
the EPA, nonprofits,

04:43.460 --> 04:44.700
not individual
companies.

04:44.900 --> 04:47.570
Well, the first thing
we need to do

04:47.770 --> 04:49.270
is get you somewhere safe.

04:49.470 --> 04:52.220
I'll send someone to do
the same for your mother.

04:53.460 --> 04:54.510
Thank you.

04:54.710 --> 04:56.840
Yeah.
They killed everybody.

04:57.040 --> 04:59.280
Who would do
something like this?

04:59.480 --> 05:01.130
I don't know.

05:02.870 --> 05:05.330
But that's exactly what
I'm gonna find out.

05:06.300 --> 05:07.550
Can you imagine?

05:07.750 --> 05:09.920
Y-You get up to go get
a cup of coffee,

05:10.120 --> 05:12.890
say hello to Sheila and Barry,

05:13.090 --> 05:14.730
and the next thing you know...
(sighs)

05:14.930 --> 05:16.560
I'm traumatized
just thinking about it,

05:16.760 --> 05:17.860
and I don't even work
with anyone.

05:18.060 --> 05:19.130
Uh, hello?

05:19.330 --> 05:20.830
Oh, come on.
You're not an office mate.

05:21.030 --> 05:22.970
You're more of a life-mate mate.

05:23.170 --> 05:24.200
(both chuckling)

05:24.400 --> 05:25.570
Harry, can you check
all the street cams

05:25.770 --> 05:27.010
that are facing
Devon's office?

05:27.210 --> 05:28.670
Yeah, maybe you can see
the killer coming or going.

05:28.870 --> 05:30.740
Yeah. Already on it.
And, uh...

05:30.940 --> 05:34.750
I'm gonna pull up all the cams
from the 39th precinct

05:34.950 --> 05:36.880
where Devon said he saw
the killer waiting.

05:37.080 --> 05:39.080
What do we know about
Devon's personal life?

05:39.280 --> 05:40.420
Not much.

05:40.620 --> 05:42.290
He was too shell-shocked
to get into all that.

05:42.490 --> 05:44.190
I'll do a deep dive
into his personal life.

05:44.390 --> 05:45.560
And all his coworkers.

05:45.760 --> 05:47.060
And all the recent dealings
of his firm.

05:47.260 --> 05:49.160
Anything else?
Uh, shoe sizes?

05:49.360 --> 05:50.160
Pets' birthdays?

05:50.360 --> 05:51.200
You're the best,
babe.

05:51.400 --> 05:52.530
Yeah, true story.

05:52.730 --> 05:54.280
ROBYN:
Hey, let us know what you find.

05:55.250 --> 05:56.570
(billiard balls clattering)

05:56.770 --> 05:58.040
("Footsteps in the Dark"
by The Isley Brothers playing)

05:58.240 --> 05:59.940
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, you see that?

06:00.140 --> 06:01.010
See that?

06:01.210 --> 06:04.140
* Are we really sure... *

06:04.340 --> 06:05.180
Ah, damn.

06:05.380 --> 06:06.480
Your shot.

06:06.680 --> 06:09.550
* That a love that lasted
for so long... *

06:09.750 --> 06:10.930
Dante.

06:12.670 --> 06:14.700
(sighs)
Damn. My bad.

06:15.870 --> 06:18.390
What's going on?
What do you mean?

06:18.590 --> 06:20.810
What do you mean
what do I mean?

06:22.040 --> 06:24.230
I mean, that right there--
that was an easy shot for you.

06:24.430 --> 06:26.500
Plus, you walk around
with that look on your face.

06:26.700 --> 06:27.930
What look?

06:28.130 --> 06:29.640
That look right there.
What, you in trouble?

06:29.840 --> 06:31.640
You know, that's the same
look you had when, uh--

06:31.840 --> 06:33.310
what's his name--

06:33.510 --> 06:34.540
Ross stole your bike.

06:34.740 --> 06:36.270
(laughs)

06:36.480 --> 06:38.410
You know how many sidewalks I
had to shovel to buy that bike?

06:38.610 --> 06:40.650
All I know is you was walking
up and down the street...

06:40.850 --> 06:42.210
(mimicking cries)

06:42.410 --> 06:43.950
(laughing)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:44.150 --> 06:45.620
That's 'cause I knew
what my father was gonna say.

06:45.820 --> 06:47.690
Man, your pops was
a piece of work, bro.

06:47.890 --> 06:48.750
(chuckles)

06:48.950 --> 06:50.290
And when he found Ross,

06:50.490 --> 06:51.560
what did he do?

06:51.760 --> 06:53.060
He found that boy
and he made me fight him

06:53.260 --> 06:56.030
even though he was
older than me, bigger than me...

06:56.230 --> 06:57.630
(chuckles) Yeah.

06:57.830 --> 06:59.250
That's my father.

07:00.050 --> 07:01.330
Yeah, and then he stood there

07:01.530 --> 07:02.440
and watched you get
your ass handed to you.

07:02.640 --> 07:03.840
Yeah, so I took

07:04.040 --> 07:05.500
two ass-whippings that day--
one from Ross,

07:05.700 --> 07:06.510
the other from my father

07:06.710 --> 07:08.070
for losing.

07:08.270 --> 07:10.080
Why do you think I spent
so much time at your dad's gym?

07:10.280 --> 07:13.850
Man, our fathers were
two of a kind, brother.

07:14.050 --> 07:15.610
Yeah, you could say that.

07:15.810 --> 07:17.850
So, that's what's going on?

07:18.050 --> 07:21.470
Big Ben coming home soon?
Not soon. Tomorrow.

07:22.810 --> 07:23.660
Damn.

07:23.860 --> 07:25.990
(sighs)

07:26.190 --> 07:28.230
You're gonna let the past
stay in the past?

07:28.430 --> 07:30.400
Just because I agreed
to let him meet the boys,

07:30.600 --> 07:32.330
doesn't mean I'm ready
to start playing catch

07:32.530 --> 07:34.180
and fixing cars together.

07:35.850 --> 07:37.170
So what you gonna do?

07:37.370 --> 07:39.000
You know, when I was kid
I didn't have a choice.

07:39.200 --> 07:40.890
I had to deal with him.

07:41.890 --> 07:42.980
At least now I get to control

07:43.180 --> 07:45.880
what happens
between him and my boys.

07:46.080 --> 07:48.480
First sign of smoke,
I shut it down.

07:48.680 --> 07:50.020
No, I'm talking about

07:50.220 --> 07:53.740
what are you gonna do
between you and him?

07:54.640 --> 07:56.470
There is no me and him.

07:58.170 --> 07:59.630
That ship has sailed.

07:59.830 --> 08:01.110
<i>(elevator bell dings)</i>

08:03.350 --> 08:04.880
This is it.

08:06.110 --> 08:07.930
Place seems quiet
from what went down here.

08:08.130 --> 08:09.330
ROBYN:
Too quiet.

08:09.530 --> 08:11.850
* *

08:13.160 --> 08:14.220
Clear.

08:23.870 --> 08:25.080
What the hell?

08:25.280 --> 08:27.790
I thought eight people
were killed here.

08:27.990 --> 08:29.190
That's what he told me.

08:29.390 --> 08:32.890
Okay, so... did he
hallucinate the whole thing?

08:33.090 --> 08:35.490
Or, uh, was he just lying to you
this whole time?

08:35.690 --> 08:40.480
No. The guy I talked to was
genuinely afraid for his life.

08:45.720 --> 08:47.290
Something's off.

08:48.620 --> 08:51.240
You know, I think
this was made to seem old.

08:51.440 --> 08:52.980
Patched bullet holes.

08:53.180 --> 08:54.410
MEL: The whole
office was staged.

08:54.610 --> 08:56.380
Devon wasn't lying.

08:56.580 --> 08:59.990
And if this place was
completely cleaned up

09:00.190 --> 09:01.720
in a matter of
hours, then...

09:01.920 --> 09:03.920
We're dealing with
some serious pros.

09:04.120 --> 09:06.440
(phone ringing)

09:08.380 --> 09:09.700
Hey, Harry,
what you got for us?

09:09.900 --> 09:11.000
So I tried pulling the footage

09:11.200 --> 09:12.870
from the area surrounding
Devon's work.

09:13.070 --> 09:14.000
The operative word being "try."

09:14.200 --> 09:15.170
What was the problem?

09:15.370 --> 09:17.100
HARRY:
Every last street-cam

09:17.300 --> 09:19.340
facing Devon's building
was somehow

09:19.540 --> 09:20.940
turned off an hour before

09:21.140 --> 09:23.240
and two hours directly
after the attack took place.

09:23.440 --> 09:25.080
Wait, are you saying
we're completely in the dark

09:25.280 --> 09:26.480
about who's behind this?

09:26.680 --> 09:28.450
Well, no, I didn't say that.

09:28.650 --> 09:29.950
So, across the street,

09:30.150 --> 09:31.520
where the cams were
still functioning,

09:31.720 --> 09:34.350
I managed to spot a ghost
walking away from the building

09:34.550 --> 09:36.590
an hour and a half
after the attack took place.

09:36.790 --> 09:37.920
A ghost, as in--

09:38.120 --> 09:38.960
HARRY:
This person knew the exact area

09:39.160 --> 09:39.990
that the street cams covered

09:40.190 --> 09:41.130
and was careful to avoid it.

09:41.330 --> 09:42.490
But not careful enough.

09:42.700 --> 09:46.100
I caught him in a reflection
on a parked car.

09:46.300 --> 09:48.100
Was it clear enough
for you to get an ID?

09:48.300 --> 09:49.370
No, not with the naked eye,

09:49.570 --> 09:50.870
but I'm using
an AI-based program

09:51.070 --> 09:53.070
to try to enhance it,
just hold tight.

09:53.270 --> 09:54.810
Yeah, okay. There it is.

09:55.010 --> 09:56.270
(phone chimes)
HARRY: Okay.

09:56.470 --> 09:58.860
Sending you
the reconstructed image.

09:59.700 --> 10:00.910
What? You recognize him?

10:01.110 --> 10:02.580
Colton Fisk.
HARRY: Fisk?

10:02.780 --> 10:04.750
You mean the guy that got
all those agents killed

10:04.950 --> 10:05.950
the last time
you worked with him?

10:06.150 --> 10:07.150
Yeah, that's him.

10:07.350 --> 10:08.720
Rob...

10:08.920 --> 10:12.760
Is it possible that Colton Fisk
is responsible for all this?

10:12.960 --> 10:15.140
* *

10:18.550 --> 10:20.580
* *

10:29.320 --> 10:30.880
Seriously, Rob, how well
do you know this Fisk guy?

10:31.080 --> 10:32.180
I don't.

10:32.380 --> 10:33.580
But I did some recon
after I met him.

10:33.780 --> 10:35.580
The guy's a ghost.
Mm-hmm.

10:35.780 --> 10:37.020
One thing I do know...
Yeah?

10:37.220 --> 10:39.420
He didn't hesitate to
put my life in danger,

10:39.620 --> 10:41.990
all over some stupid test.

10:42.190 --> 10:44.120
Ringing endorsement
of his moral code.

10:44.320 --> 10:45.660
It's the CIA.

10:45.860 --> 10:48.030
You don't get to his level
with a moral code.
True.

10:48.230 --> 10:49.960
And we both know
the CIA is capable of

10:50.160 --> 10:51.130
this kind of cover-up.

10:51.330 --> 10:53.070
Thing is,
Bishop trained Fisk.

10:53.270 --> 10:54.870
Same as me.

10:55.070 --> 10:56.430
Would Bishop put
that much faith

10:56.630 --> 10:58.070
in someone who would order
this kind of massacre?

10:58.270 --> 10:59.840
People change, Rob.

11:00.040 --> 11:01.840
That's why I can't
rule Fisk out.

11:02.040 --> 11:05.190
I got to get him face-to-face
and demand some answers.

11:06.630 --> 11:08.180
Needed that.
Oh...

11:08.380 --> 11:10.020
Same time next week?
Yes, sir.

11:10.220 --> 11:12.600
Love you, baby.
Love you too, bro.

11:21.140 --> 11:22.610
Manny!

11:25.410 --> 11:26.800
(groaning)
Hey.

11:27.000 --> 11:27.900
All right.

11:28.100 --> 11:29.900
Hold that.
Keep the pressure.

11:30.100 --> 11:30.970
(dialing)

11:31.170 --> 11:31.840
DISPATCHER: 911.

11:32.040 --> 11:34.370
911? I need an ambulance.

11:34.570 --> 11:36.990
GSW corner of 5th and Clinton.

11:38.130 --> 11:40.930
I got you, brother.
I got you.

11:52.640 --> 11:54.430
You understand
this is not how

11:54.630 --> 11:56.130
our arrangement works,
right, Mall Cop?

11:56.330 --> 11:58.200
I call you when I need you,

11:58.400 --> 12:00.580
not the other way around.

12:02.680 --> 12:04.670
I don't have time
for your nonsense.

12:04.870 --> 12:07.210
Why were you at the scene
of a mass murder today?

12:07.410 --> 12:08.270
How'd you know that?

12:08.470 --> 12:09.670
I'm not taking questions--

12:09.880 --> 12:11.880
Keshegian must've spotted me.

12:12.080 --> 12:13.750
Bishop was right,
he's pretty good.

12:13.950 --> 12:15.150
Keep Bishop's name
out your mouth.

12:15.350 --> 12:17.180
Especially when you try
to hold it over my head.

12:17.380 --> 12:18.550
I get it.

12:18.750 --> 12:19.750
I wouldn't want to be
reminded, either.

12:19.950 --> 12:21.290
Bishop knew the risk
he was taking

12:21.490 --> 12:22.590
when he got on that plane.

12:22.790 --> 12:24.720
Man never did a damn thing
he didn't want to.

12:24.920 --> 12:26.290
That's why I respected him.

12:26.490 --> 12:28.160
So miss me with the guilt.

12:28.360 --> 12:29.590
Fair enough.

12:29.790 --> 12:31.860
Now stop deflecting
and answer my question.

12:32.060 --> 12:33.130
I hate to disappoint you,

12:33.330 --> 12:35.230
but I had zero to do
with what happened

12:35.430 --> 12:36.600
at that office today.

12:36.800 --> 12:38.400
Oh, you just happened to be
in the neighborhood.

12:38.600 --> 12:39.840
I picked up some
background chatter

12:40.040 --> 12:41.240
about some kind of incident.

12:41.440 --> 12:42.610
I went down there to see,

12:42.810 --> 12:44.180
only to find what
I'm assuming you did--

12:44.380 --> 12:46.080
that the place had
already been cleaned.

12:46.280 --> 12:49.150
By professionals who knew
what they were doing.

12:49.350 --> 12:50.950
Like the CIA.

12:51.150 --> 12:52.420
I just told you,
the Company had

12:52.620 --> 12:54.320
no involvement
in any of this.

12:54.520 --> 12:56.620
I'm just supposed to take your
word for that and walk away.

12:56.820 --> 12:59.620
No, I want you to stay

12:59.820 --> 13:01.890
and help me figure out
who's behind this.

13:02.090 --> 13:04.060
You want us
to work this together?

13:04.260 --> 13:07.000
"Want" is kind of a
polite way of putting it.

13:07.200 --> 13:09.170
I mean, do I really
need to remind you

13:09.370 --> 13:10.370
about your obligation

13:10.570 --> 13:12.340
to your former
employer?

13:12.540 --> 13:14.110
Fine.

13:14.310 --> 13:16.710
But only because
you might be useful to me.

13:16.910 --> 13:18.880
So, how'd you hear
about this, anyway?

13:19.080 --> 13:22.010
You just, uh, happened to
be in the neighborhood?

13:22.210 --> 13:23.150
Need to know.

13:23.350 --> 13:25.180
And you don't.

13:25.380 --> 13:27.720
You're helping someone.

13:27.920 --> 13:29.670
There was a survivor.

13:31.110 --> 13:32.620
I don't know
what you're talking about.

13:32.820 --> 13:35.390
(scoffs) You really
don't trust me, do you?

13:35.590 --> 13:38.210
I'm still waiting for a reason.

13:39.180 --> 13:40.570
I will share this...

13:40.770 --> 13:41.750
(phone clicks)

13:42.550 --> 13:45.200
My sources say this is the guy
who shot up the office.

13:45.400 --> 13:48.070
FISK: He's standing
outside a police station.

13:48.270 --> 13:51.240
Most likely waiting
for your client to show up.

13:51.440 --> 13:52.850
Do you know him or not?

13:53.050 --> 13:54.760
He's not in the system.

13:56.600 --> 13:58.380
Carlos Ruiz.

13:58.580 --> 13:59.620
You do know him.

13:59.820 --> 14:01.090
We've crossed paths.

14:01.290 --> 14:03.490
He's Nicaraguan Army,
Special Forces.

14:03.690 --> 14:04.860
Nicaraguan Army?

14:05.060 --> 14:06.460
What do they have
to do with this?

14:06.660 --> 14:09.360
That's what Carlos is gonna
tell us when we find him.

14:09.560 --> 14:13.200
Okay, so-- if I'm Carlos,

14:13.400 --> 14:15.130
and I'm waiting
for a scared civilian

14:15.330 --> 14:16.300
to show their face,

14:16.500 --> 14:17.740
where do I go?

14:17.940 --> 14:19.000
His apartment.

14:19.200 --> 14:21.410
Let's go,
Mall Cop.

14:21.610 --> 14:23.790
* *

14:28.660 --> 14:30.980
(siren wailing)

14:31.180 --> 14:33.290
PARAMEDIC:
Pulse is weak and thready.

14:33.490 --> 14:35.240
(monitor beeping steadily)

14:36.940 --> 14:38.740
He's gonna be okay?

14:39.670 --> 14:41.680
He's gonna make it, right?

14:50.950 --> 14:53.370
You really trust Fisk
enough to work with him?

14:53.570 --> 14:55.010
No.

14:55.210 --> 14:57.880
But that's not the nature of
my arrangement with the CIA.

14:58.080 --> 14:59.950
Well, Rob, maybe it's time
for a new arrangement.

15:00.150 --> 15:02.410
Yeah, it was one thing
working with Bishop,

15:02.610 --> 15:03.880
but this guy--
It's okay.

15:04.080 --> 15:05.980
I think Fisk knows more
than he's letting on.

15:06.180 --> 15:07.720
This way I get to find out what.

15:07.920 --> 15:09.750
Okay, uh,
what's the plan?

15:09.950 --> 15:11.390
I'm on the way
to our client's apartment.

15:11.590 --> 15:13.560
I think the shooter
might be waiting there.

15:13.760 --> 15:14.830
How is Devon, anyway?

15:15.030 --> 15:16.460
He's better now that
I brought his mother

15:16.660 --> 15:17.900
to the safe house with him.

15:18.100 --> 15:19.500
I mean, he's still
understandably freaked out

15:19.700 --> 15:21.700
that someone tried to kill him
and we have no idea why.

15:21.900 --> 15:22.830
Well, not no idea.

15:23.040 --> 15:23.970
Did you find something?

15:24.170 --> 15:25.840
HARRY:
Maybe. I did a deep dive

15:26.040 --> 15:27.410
into Devon
and his coworkers.

15:27.610 --> 15:29.110
There's no red flags.

15:29.310 --> 15:30.480
And then I started looking into
the dealings of his company.

15:30.680 --> 15:31.880
Marine biology research, right?

15:32.080 --> 15:33.980
Yeah. So I hacked into
the company's cloud

15:34.180 --> 15:37.220
and, uh, scoured the employees'
Internet search history,

15:37.420 --> 15:40.020
and while most of it was
just environmental stuff,

15:40.220 --> 15:42.050
one search did stand out.

15:42.250 --> 15:43.090
How so?

15:43.290 --> 15:44.860
This one employee, Frank Terry,

15:45.060 --> 15:46.930
seemed to be focused
on South America

15:47.130 --> 15:49.090
while everybody else's research
was North America-based.

15:49.290 --> 15:52.060
And then, 45 minutes after
his last search inquiry,

15:52.260 --> 15:54.330
the bad guys show up.
What was the search?

15:54.530 --> 15:57.800
Three words--
Nicaragua, power, stone.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.540
Fisk ID'd the guy
we're looking for

15:59.740 --> 16:01.710
as Nicaraguan Special Forces.

16:01.910 --> 16:03.410
Well, that can't be
a coincidence.

16:03.610 --> 16:06.210
Nicaragua. Power. Stone.

16:06.410 --> 16:08.780
What, specifically, was
that employee researching?

16:08.980 --> 16:10.050
It's hard to say.

16:10.250 --> 16:11.420
But I think
he was just starting.

16:11.620 --> 16:13.500
And somebody didn't
want him to finish.

16:14.900 --> 16:17.160
I just arrived
at Devon's apartment.

16:17.360 --> 16:18.460
Be careful, Rob.

16:18.660 --> 16:19.760
You still don't know
who you're dealing with.

16:19.960 --> 16:22.310
Yeah, well...
neither do they.

16:25.610 --> 16:27.850
* *

16:41.130 --> 16:42.980
VOICE (over phone):
Code name.

16:43.180 --> 16:44.080
Blue Star checking in.

16:44.280 --> 16:45.120
Status?
Urgent.

16:45.320 --> 16:46.750
There's another player involved.

16:46.950 --> 16:48.490
VOICE:
Abort. Return to checkpoint.

16:48.690 --> 16:49.550
Copy on abort.

16:49.750 --> 16:50.960
Returning to checkpoint.

16:51.160 --> 16:52.220
(voice speaks indistinctly)

16:52.420 --> 16:53.860
Don't worry, they won't see me.

16:54.060 --> 16:56.180
* *

17:01.480 --> 17:02.920
Carlos.

17:04.490 --> 17:06.150
(speaking Spanish)

17:10.830 --> 17:12.590
(two gunshots)

17:15.960 --> 17:17.750
ROBYN:
Damn it, Fisk.

17:17.950 --> 17:19.120
We were supposed
to question him!

17:19.320 --> 17:20.990
When he drew on me,
I had no choice.

17:21.190 --> 17:23.190
It was kill
or be killed.

17:23.390 --> 17:24.960
Oh, come on, you think
I shot him on purpose?

17:25.160 --> 17:26.790
I want answers
as much as you do.

17:26.990 --> 17:28.460
Okay.

17:28.660 --> 17:30.010
Then let's get some.

17:39.990 --> 17:41.390
All right.

17:43.260 --> 17:45.710
Last call he made was
about five minutes ago.

17:45.910 --> 17:47.150
(line ringing)
What are you doing?

17:47.350 --> 17:48.650
They're gonna know
someone's onto them.
Yeah.

17:48.850 --> 17:50.380
They're gonna know
when Carlos doesn't check in,

17:50.580 --> 17:52.620
because you killed--
VOICE (over phone): Code name?

17:52.820 --> 17:54.220
Code name?

17:54.420 --> 17:56.790
Code name--
(call beeps off)

17:56.990 --> 17:58.020
You hear that?

17:58.220 --> 18:00.340
American accent. Strange.

18:04.750 --> 18:07.050
ROBYN:
American passport.

18:10.150 --> 18:11.340
Forgery is perfect.

18:11.540 --> 18:14.290
No one would be able
to tell this isn't real.

18:15.760 --> 18:18.960
Only one place I know puts
out fakes of this quality...

18:20.660 --> 18:23.050
...is Langley.

18:23.250 --> 18:26.430
(exhales softly)
This guy worked for the CIA.

18:33.380 --> 18:34.560
Hey, I thought
we were friends.

18:34.760 --> 18:35.590
What are you talking
about, Harry?

18:35.790 --> 18:36.860
So I, uh, traced that number

18:37.060 --> 18:38.600
from your Nicaraguan
buddy's phone

18:38.800 --> 18:41.700
and it led me to the one place
that could get me

18:41.900 --> 18:43.570
thrown back in the joint--
Langley.

18:43.770 --> 18:44.700
Are you sure?

18:44.900 --> 18:46.200
Yeah.
No, I like my life.

18:46.400 --> 18:48.310
And I intend to keep it,
so I've gone to extreme measures

18:48.510 --> 18:49.640
to make sure that I'm alerted

18:49.840 --> 18:51.610
anytime I'm anywhere
near a CIA server.

18:51.810 --> 18:53.280
Once I started tracking
this number,

18:53.480 --> 18:54.480
my system went berserk.

18:54.680 --> 18:56.180
I'm so sorry, Harry.

18:56.380 --> 18:58.120
I was blindsided, too.

18:58.320 --> 18:59.720
(call beeps off)

18:59.920 --> 19:02.490
I thought you said
the CIA wasn't involved.

19:02.690 --> 19:05.070
We're not.
At least not officially.

19:05.870 --> 19:07.990
Okay, you got about five
seconds to start talking.

19:08.190 --> 19:09.890
And then you can take
your arrangement--

19:10.090 --> 19:12.260
15 years ago,
the Company initiated

19:12.460 --> 19:14.600
a black ops program
called Nomad.

19:14.800 --> 19:15.600
Whose purpose was?

19:15.800 --> 19:17.600
Destabilize global hotspots.

19:17.800 --> 19:20.040
Create power vacuums
when it was in our interest.

19:20.240 --> 19:22.070
Create chaos.

19:22.270 --> 19:24.060
What the CIA does best.

19:24.960 --> 19:27.780
It was mostly
false flag operations.

19:27.980 --> 19:29.580
Nomad would hire mercs
from country A

19:29.780 --> 19:31.750
to attack country B
who would think that it was

19:31.950 --> 19:33.920
an act of sanctioned
aggression by country A.

19:34.120 --> 19:35.790
The way the Company
starts wars.

19:35.990 --> 19:38.160
And exactly
the kind of gutless

19:38.360 --> 19:41.230
but effective program
that you would approve of.

19:41.430 --> 19:43.330
I did, at first.

19:43.530 --> 19:45.130
But the people running Nomad

19:45.330 --> 19:47.060
were reckless,
impatient.

19:47.270 --> 19:48.900
You mean you couldn't
control them.

19:49.100 --> 19:51.370
Bombings and assassinations
became their go-to methods

19:51.570 --> 19:52.900
to achieve faster results.

19:53.100 --> 19:54.940
But there was too much
collateral damage.

19:55.140 --> 19:57.140
As soon as I discovered
what was happening,

19:57.340 --> 19:59.190
I shut the program down.

20:03.370 --> 20:06.280
ROBYN:
So you think
Nomad has been reactivated.

20:06.480 --> 20:07.990
I've had my suspicions
for some time.

20:08.190 --> 20:09.920
Well, when were you gonna
share them with me?

20:10.120 --> 20:12.220
I'm sharing them with you now.

20:12.420 --> 20:13.990
I just needed
some kind of confirmation.

20:14.190 --> 20:16.690
Like a Nicaraguan soldier
with ties to Langley.

20:16.890 --> 20:19.260
Exactly like that,
but what I don't understand

20:19.460 --> 20:22.200
is who has revived the program
and what are they planning.

20:22.400 --> 20:24.400
Are you saying that
the CIA doesn't know

20:24.600 --> 20:25.840
that Nomad is back
up and running?

20:26.040 --> 20:27.540
I certainly hadn't
heard about it.

20:27.740 --> 20:29.940
Director Platt's in town
for a meeting at the U.N.

20:30.140 --> 20:31.740
I'm seeing him first thing
in the morning.

20:31.940 --> 20:35.160
I will brief you
as soon as I get answers.

20:40.300 --> 20:42.370
Auntie!

20:43.270 --> 20:45.770
I got red velvet cake
from Melba's!

20:47.440 --> 20:50.500
Ooh, I see you,
Aunt Vi.

20:50.700 --> 20:52.530
Little cake before your date?

20:52.730 --> 20:55.300
No. I'm gonna have
my dessert later.

20:55.500 --> 20:56.950
Oh.
(chuckles)

20:58.220 --> 20:59.700
Mm. Okay.

20:59.900 --> 21:01.970
So, uh, where are you
and Trish going?

21:02.170 --> 21:03.410
New play at the
Golden Theatre.

21:03.610 --> 21:06.280
Okay. Well,
Tell her I said hi.

21:06.480 --> 21:07.480
You know I will.

21:07.680 --> 21:10.530
(chuckling)
What are you gonna do?

21:11.330 --> 21:13.820
Smash this cake
and catch up on some shows.

21:14.020 --> 21:15.550
All right, then.
Good night.

21:15.750 --> 21:17.100
Good night.

21:20.580 --> 21:23.140
* *

21:26.110 --> 21:27.650
(sighs)

21:29.350 --> 21:31.170
(sighs)

21:31.370 --> 21:32.750
(phone buzzes)

21:43.000 --> 21:45.700
What you
grinning about?

21:47.740 --> 21:49.250
Hey, easy.

21:49.450 --> 21:51.040
Try not to move.

21:52.270 --> 21:53.840
Nurse?

21:56.410 --> 21:57.300
Manny.

21:57.500 --> 21:59.410
You see the shooter?

22:00.650 --> 22:02.650
Nah...

22:03.690 --> 22:05.150
Are you in
some kind of trouble?

22:06.120 --> 22:09.270
I did get into it
with a guy at the gym.

22:09.470 --> 22:11.940
Give me a name.
MANNY:
Lo-Lo.

22:12.140 --> 22:14.810
He's a dealer.
He was... (groans)

22:15.010 --> 22:17.130
...pressing one of my fighters.

22:19.500 --> 22:23.290
Sorry, Detective, I need
you to step into the hall.

22:23.490 --> 22:24.820
I'll be right outside.

22:25.020 --> 22:27.210
(slow steady beeping)

22:36.980 --> 22:39.450
Shawn.
Uncle Marcus?

22:40.690 --> 22:42.410
I'm so sorry.

22:42.610 --> 22:43.680
Where is he?

22:43.880 --> 22:45.080
Getting his
vitals checked,

22:45.280 --> 22:47.430
but he appears
to be stable.

22:48.730 --> 22:50.130
So, he's gonna live?

22:51.670 --> 22:52.850
Yeah, doctors think so,

22:53.050 --> 22:54.790
but he's not out
of the woods yet.

22:54.990 --> 22:57.120
A'ight, I'm off.

22:57.320 --> 22:59.520
Look, I only came to make
sure he was gonna live.

22:59.720 --> 23:01.790
Shawn,
he's your father.
And?

23:01.990 --> 23:03.190
What, what?
I'm supposed to be

23:03.390 --> 23:04.900
all broken up because
he's in a bad spot?

23:05.100 --> 23:07.330
Where was he when me and
my mom were struggling?

23:07.530 --> 23:10.000
I'll tell you where.
At that damn gym.

23:10.200 --> 23:11.500
Trying to help everybody
in the neighborhood

23:11.700 --> 23:12.700
except for us.

23:12.900 --> 23:15.020
(exhales)

23:16.760 --> 23:18.990
* *

23:28.540 --> 23:30.100
Hey.

23:38.650 --> 23:40.160
About time
you decided to show up.

23:40.360 --> 23:41.970
I guess you don't
trust me to brief you

23:42.170 --> 23:43.700
on my convo with
the director, huh?

23:43.900 --> 23:45.790
I don't trust you, period.

23:46.890 --> 23:48.970
Colton. The director
is ready to see you.

23:49.170 --> 23:51.910
Thanks Di.
Owe you big-time.
Oh, please.

23:52.110 --> 23:54.430
After all the favors you've
done me over the years?

23:58.330 --> 24:00.950
The Nomad project?
Are you sure?

24:01.150 --> 24:02.250
All signs point to it.

24:02.450 --> 24:03.620
If you're right,

24:03.820 --> 24:05.120
and anyone
finds out about this,

24:05.320 --> 24:06.860
the blowback on the Company
would be disastrous.

24:07.060 --> 24:09.260
And innocent lives
would be lost.

24:09.460 --> 24:12.400
If they're planning
a false flag attack,

24:12.600 --> 24:13.600
we have to stop it.

24:13.800 --> 24:14.600
And you don't know
who's behind it?

24:14.800 --> 24:16.070
Not yet. But I will.

24:16.270 --> 24:18.440
Well, whoever it is,
they're missing an operative.

24:18.640 --> 24:20.200
So they probably know
someone's onto them.

24:20.400 --> 24:21.810
Which means
if we don't move fast,

24:22.010 --> 24:24.160
they might close up shop
and disappear.

24:24.960 --> 24:26.210
Smoke them out.

24:26.410 --> 24:27.980
Put an end to this.

24:28.180 --> 24:30.210
I'm sure Tate
will be your first stop.

24:30.410 --> 24:31.280
Ian Tate?

24:31.480 --> 24:33.250
As in Tate
Military Group?

24:33.450 --> 24:34.350
You know him?

24:34.550 --> 24:35.590
Only that any time

24:35.790 --> 24:36.720
his private army
gets called in,

24:36.920 --> 24:38.860
it leads to bloodshed.

24:39.060 --> 24:40.840
How is he involved?

24:41.810 --> 24:46.030
Tate is the original founder
of the Nomad project.

24:46.230 --> 24:47.530
He also hates my guts.

24:47.730 --> 24:50.200
Because you're the one
who shut Nomad down

24:50.400 --> 24:53.190
and got him kicked
out of the CIA.

24:55.090 --> 24:57.290
Well, guess it's time
for a reunion.

25:03.400 --> 25:05.780
Morning, chief.
How you feeling?

25:05.980 --> 25:07.300
Feeling good.

25:08.100 --> 25:09.920
It's just Shawn
I'm worried about.

25:10.120 --> 25:12.760
Ah, all that stuff he was
saying? He didn't mean it.

25:12.960 --> 25:14.380
No, he meant it.

25:15.740 --> 25:17.260
I mean, granted,
he's only getting

25:17.460 --> 25:19.850
half the story
from his mother, but...

25:20.650 --> 25:22.400
...I deserve it.

25:22.600 --> 25:25.040
I pushed that boy hard...

25:25.240 --> 25:28.620
till I guess I just
pushed him away.

25:29.420 --> 25:33.490
And my father was tough on me,
so I was tough on him.

25:36.030 --> 25:37.410
You know,
right before my dad died,

25:37.620 --> 25:40.790
he finally told me
about all the crap

25:40.990 --> 25:42.870
he dealt with
growing up in the South.

25:43.740 --> 25:45.640
I knew it was bad, but...

25:49.110 --> 25:51.350
...nobody should have
to endure that.

25:52.850 --> 25:54.170
I never knew that.

25:54.370 --> 25:55.980
Me, either.

25:57.380 --> 26:00.500
I guess that was
his way of... (exhales)

26:00.710 --> 26:02.140
...trying to apologize.

26:02.340 --> 26:04.840
Never had a way to deal
with all that trauma,

26:05.040 --> 26:06.640
so he just poured it onto me.

26:06.840 --> 26:07.910
(inhales sharply)

26:08.110 --> 26:08.950
(sighs)

26:09.150 --> 26:10.700
I just wish I knew...

26:11.670 --> 26:14.220
...'cause I might have found
a way to forgive him.

26:14.420 --> 26:16.320
No way you would've known.

26:16.520 --> 26:18.610
Just how they were back then.

26:19.570 --> 26:21.910
I didn't have to pass it on.

26:23.610 --> 26:26.950
Hey, our fathers were the same
and look at you.

26:27.750 --> 26:31.420
You found a way not to pass
that on to your boys.

26:33.090 --> 26:35.690
Maybe it's not too late
for you and Shawn.

26:37.090 --> 26:38.860
Yeah, I hope so.

26:39.760 --> 26:41.850
If he can find a way
to get past all that anger,

26:42.050 --> 26:43.650
I'd love to get another shot.

26:43.850 --> 26:45.600
(groaning)

26:46.570 --> 26:48.550
I just hate that
I never had a chance

26:48.750 --> 26:51.020
to reconcile with my father

26:51.220 --> 26:52.870
before it was too late.

26:54.010 --> 26:58.950
But sitting in this hospital,
I know for sure life is short.

26:59.810 --> 27:02.350
(sighs) Yeah.

27:04.990 --> 27:06.540
MAN: Go, go, go!
(gunfire)

27:06.740 --> 27:07.540
Move, move!

27:07.740 --> 27:09.690
(indistinct shouting)

27:20.770 --> 27:22.350
(blows whistle)

27:22.550 --> 27:23.770
MAN:
Hold your fire!

27:24.610 --> 27:26.360
It's not smart for you and
your friend to be here, Fisk.

27:26.560 --> 27:28.130
Neither is
using live ammo

27:28.330 --> 27:30.280
for a training
exercise.

27:32.010 --> 27:33.970
We train how we fight.

27:34.170 --> 27:36.830
The enemy doesn't use blanks,
neither do we.

27:37.030 --> 27:39.340
Besides, my men have
the best body armor

27:39.540 --> 27:40.810
on the planet.

27:41.010 --> 27:41.840
(grunts)

27:42.040 --> 27:43.070
What the hell?

27:43.270 --> 27:45.130
Not the time.

27:46.630 --> 27:47.950
You're insane.

27:48.150 --> 27:50.530
Nah, I'm just impatient.

27:51.300 --> 27:52.720
What are you doing here,
Colton?

27:52.920 --> 27:54.020
I have intel suggesting

27:54.220 --> 27:56.290
the Nomad project
has been reactivated.

27:56.490 --> 27:57.990
That doesn't answer
my question.

27:58.190 --> 28:00.320
You wouldn't happen to know
anything about that, would you?

28:00.520 --> 28:02.090
(scoffs) You've got a lot
of nerve showing up here,

28:02.290 --> 28:03.560
accusing me,
after what you pulled.

28:03.760 --> 28:06.100
Do you or don't you
have an op planned

28:06.300 --> 28:07.300
involving Nicaragua?

28:07.500 --> 28:09.230
Nicaragua?
You listen to me.

28:09.430 --> 28:11.300
That lithium mine
is ours.
Lithium?

28:11.500 --> 28:12.290
Lithium?

28:12.850 --> 28:15.440
TATE:
I got customers willing
to pay me top dollar

28:15.640 --> 28:16.670
to secure that mine.

28:16.870 --> 28:19.410
So whatever Nomad knockoff
the CIA deployed,

28:19.610 --> 28:21.810
you tell them to back off
or I'll make the old program

28:22.010 --> 28:23.450
look like a daycare center.

28:23.650 --> 28:24.880
(blows whistle)

28:25.080 --> 28:26.320
(man issuing orders)

28:26.520 --> 28:28.640
You guys have 60 seconds
before bullets start flying.

28:31.240 --> 28:33.090
You think Nomad's after
that lithium?

28:33.290 --> 28:34.730
Fits their MO.

28:34.930 --> 28:37.590
Use a false flag op to trigger
an invasion of Nicaragua.

28:37.800 --> 28:40.460
But how does that
benefit their program?

28:40.660 --> 28:43.030
Rogue operations
need two things--

28:43.230 --> 28:44.370
money and power.

28:44.570 --> 28:47.370
Access to that lithium mine
gives them both.

28:47.570 --> 28:49.710
But which country are
they trying to mobilize?

28:49.910 --> 28:51.280
That's the question, isn't it?

28:51.480 --> 28:53.080
I'm gonna take this intel
back to Platt

28:53.280 --> 28:54.850
and see if he can help us
make sense of it.

28:55.050 --> 28:56.310
Let me guess.

28:56.510 --> 28:58.120
You're gonna keep me posted.

28:58.320 --> 29:00.220
The director will speak
much more frankly

29:00.420 --> 29:02.200
if an outsider isn't there.

29:03.070 --> 29:04.670
You left the Agency.

29:08.440 --> 29:11.530
Okay.
We'll do it your way.

29:11.730 --> 29:15.500
Okay, so the search that
triggered the office massacre

29:15.700 --> 29:18.570
was "Nicaragua,"
"power," and "stone."

29:18.770 --> 29:20.540
But if this is all about
controlling that lithium mine

29:20.740 --> 29:24.080
in Nicaragua,
could power be lithium?

29:24.280 --> 29:25.640
HARRY: Yeah, power
as in batteries?

29:25.840 --> 29:28.410
I mean, you need lithium
to power electric vehicles.

29:28.610 --> 29:30.820
That's on the verge of becoming
a trillion-dollar industry.

29:31.020 --> 29:32.420
So the mine is priceless.

29:32.620 --> 29:34.720
Okay. So, then,
what does stone signify?
Wait a minute.

29:34.920 --> 29:36.490
ROBYN:
You got something?
HARRY: Yeah, maybe.

29:36.690 --> 29:40.260
So I've been looking into
conflicts involving Nicaragua.

29:40.460 --> 29:42.160
Turns out they have
a long-standing feud

29:42.360 --> 29:43.360
with Honduras.

29:43.560 --> 29:45.160
Just recently,
Nicaraguan troops

29:45.360 --> 29:47.030
just torched
an entire village in Honduras

29:47.230 --> 29:48.600
just across the border

29:48.800 --> 29:50.530
and the Nicaraguan government
is totally denying it.

29:50.730 --> 29:53.770
So, a Nomad
false flag attack?
Yeah, maybe.

29:53.970 --> 29:56.470
But why would Nomad try
to provoke Honduras?

29:56.670 --> 29:58.140
They don't have
a military strong enough

29:58.340 --> 29:59.310
to invade Nicaragua.

29:59.510 --> 30:01.550
Nope, but the U.S. does.

30:01.750 --> 30:03.610
We're involved in
that area, aren't we?

30:03.810 --> 30:06.880
Politically, uh, the U.S.
strongly condemned the attacks

30:07.080 --> 30:08.090
and issued sanctions.

30:08.290 --> 30:09.550
But no military response.

30:09.750 --> 30:11.020
No. They sent
some troops down there,

30:11.220 --> 30:12.720
but so far,
no military intervention.

30:12.920 --> 30:15.810
Who's in charge of the U.S.
troops deployed in that area?

30:17.310 --> 30:18.660
HARRY:
Huh, what do you know?

30:18.860 --> 30:20.230
General Maxwell Stone.

30:20.430 --> 30:22.470
Stone! That's it.
That's the third word.

30:22.670 --> 30:23.870
They're gonna take out
General Stone

30:24.070 --> 30:26.540
to provoke the U.S.
into invading Nicaragua.

30:26.740 --> 30:28.340
All for control
of a lithium mine.

30:28.540 --> 30:31.260
Where's General Stone now?

30:32.390 --> 30:33.780
New York.
Landed three hours ago.

30:33.980 --> 30:36.910
Nomad is planning
a false flag attack

30:37.110 --> 30:39.200
right here in New York City.

30:45.940 --> 30:48.330
We need to warn General Stone
that his life is in danger.

30:48.530 --> 30:49.990
(scoffs) No way
he'll listen to us.

30:50.190 --> 30:51.600
But he will listen to Fisk.

30:51.800 --> 30:53.400
(line ringing)

30:53.600 --> 30:55.200
FISK (over phone):
Hey, McCall.
Fisk, you were right.

30:55.400 --> 30:57.600
Nomad is planning
a false flag attack,

30:57.800 --> 30:59.040
but this time,
it's not overseas.

30:59.240 --> 31:00.440
It's here in New York.
FISK: What?

31:00.640 --> 31:01.870
Are you sure?

31:02.070 --> 31:03.310
They're gonna assassinate
General Maxwell Stone.

31:03.510 --> 31:05.940
Of course. His stance
on the regional conflict.

31:06.140 --> 31:07.780
If there's even
a sliver of a chance

31:07.980 --> 31:09.610
you're right,
we have to act immediately.

31:09.810 --> 31:11.250
Which starts with
warning Stone.

31:11.450 --> 31:13.050
HARRY:
Except we can't call him
'cause if Nomad's

31:13.250 --> 31:14.550
been targeting him,
they're gonna be

31:14.750 --> 31:15.720
totally up on
his communications.

31:15.920 --> 31:17.320
And if they realize
we're onto them,

31:17.520 --> 31:18.560
it might force their hand.

31:18.760 --> 31:20.220
We've got to warn him
in person.

31:20.420 --> 31:23.190
I'll meet you there.
(call beeps off)

31:23.390 --> 31:25.410
* *

31:29.380 --> 31:31.100
If Nomad is gonna
make this look like a

31:31.300 --> 31:33.100
Nicaraguan-orchestrated attack,

31:33.300 --> 31:35.270
you figure they're going to use
some agents from that region.

31:35.470 --> 31:36.410
Yeah, mercs like Ruiz.

31:36.610 --> 31:37.880
Harry,

31:38.080 --> 31:39.840
see if you can find
a record of any Nicaraguan

31:40.040 --> 31:41.280
nationals entering
the country.

31:41.480 --> 31:43.510
I'll run facial rec
on all plane,

31:43.710 --> 31:44.750
private jet and boat arrivals.

31:44.950 --> 31:46.150
Yeah,
maybe we'll get lucky.

31:46.350 --> 31:47.620
Yeah, maybe.

31:47.820 --> 31:50.000
(indistinct chatter)

31:50.870 --> 31:53.140
You see him?
Not yet.

31:54.010 --> 31:55.080
(elevator bell dings)

31:56.680 --> 31:58.430
He's by the elevators.

31:58.630 --> 31:59.900
(exhales softly)

32:00.100 --> 32:01.780
General.
Stand down.

32:02.680 --> 32:03.940
As you were.

32:04.140 --> 32:05.400
General Stone, I don't
have time to explain to you

32:05.600 --> 32:06.840
who am I
or how I know this,

32:07.040 --> 32:08.870
but your life is in danger.

32:09.070 --> 32:10.770
What have you heard?
ROBYN:
We have intel

32:10.970 --> 32:12.840
that rogue U.S.
intelligence agents,

32:13.040 --> 32:14.550
posing as
Nicaraguan nationals,

32:14.750 --> 32:17.350
are planning to assassinate you
to incite war in the region.

32:17.550 --> 32:19.220
I'm supposed to just
take your word for it?

32:19.420 --> 32:20.880
She's telling the truth,
General.

32:21.090 --> 32:22.720
ROBYN:
We have a high-level
CIA agent.

32:22.920 --> 32:24.190
He'll be here any minute
to verify all this.

32:24.390 --> 32:25.520
In the meantime,
we need to get you

32:25.720 --> 32:26.960
to a secure location.

32:27.160 --> 32:28.990
Ma'am, I've seen combat
on four continents.

32:29.190 --> 32:31.060
If I ran every time
someone threatened me--

32:31.260 --> 32:33.700
Sir, with all
due respect,

32:33.900 --> 32:34.900
on the chance
that she's right,

32:35.100 --> 32:36.300
we need to
take this seriously

32:36.500 --> 32:38.100
until we can assess
the credibility of the threat.

32:38.300 --> 32:41.570
I'm not going anywhere
till I speak to this CIA agent.

32:41.770 --> 32:43.190
Let me get his ETA.

32:44.490 --> 32:46.640
Come on, Fisk...

32:46.840 --> 32:49.450
Any luck?
He's not picking up.

32:49.650 --> 32:51.320
You guys...
Harry.

32:51.520 --> 32:52.950
HARRY (over comms):
I'm not sure Fisk is coming.
What you mean?

32:53.150 --> 32:55.050
Whoever revived Nomad
has got to know about

32:55.250 --> 32:56.590
the imminent attack
on General Stone.

32:56.790 --> 32:57.890
All right? So I started

32:58.090 --> 32:59.520
looking into Ian Tate
on the off chance

32:59.720 --> 33:00.920
that he wasn't being 100% honest

33:01.130 --> 33:03.090
when he told you and Fisk
he wasn't involved.

33:03.290 --> 33:04.960
So Tate is behind this?

33:05.160 --> 33:06.360
No, I didn't find

33:06.560 --> 33:08.170
anything linking him
to the current operation,

33:08.370 --> 33:10.770
but I found a lot of records
about the original Nomad.

33:10.970 --> 33:12.340
Well, that's not surprising.
He founded it.

33:12.540 --> 33:13.700
Well, actually,
he cofounded it, right?

33:13.900 --> 33:15.040
And you know who with?

33:15.240 --> 33:16.740
Fisk.

33:16.940 --> 33:18.310
HARRY:
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

33:18.510 --> 33:20.640
So why would he hide
that information from us?

33:20.840 --> 33:22.710
Unless...
Unless he was playing you

33:22.910 --> 33:24.220
the whole time.

33:24.420 --> 33:26.250
He never gave me a damn thing
unless I forced his hand.

33:26.450 --> 33:27.580
Ruiz being an agent.

33:27.780 --> 33:29.950
The existence of
the Nomad project.

33:30.150 --> 33:31.860
He was on his way
to the director's office

33:32.060 --> 33:34.660
by himself
until I ambushed him.

33:34.860 --> 33:36.060
If Fisk is involved,

33:36.260 --> 33:37.530
and he knows
that you're with the general,

33:37.730 --> 33:39.230
then you could be
walking into an ambush.

33:39.430 --> 33:41.730
Okay, I would, I would get--
(static buzzing)

33:41.930 --> 33:43.250
Harry?

33:44.620 --> 33:46.850
Someone must be jamming it.

33:49.660 --> 33:51.590
The hotel staff.

33:53.090 --> 33:54.810
They're all Nomad agents.

33:55.010 --> 33:56.530
Gun!

34:04.770 --> 34:06.390
(grunts)
(people screaming)

34:06.590 --> 34:07.390
On me!

34:07.590 --> 34:08.390
Move, move!

34:08.590 --> 34:09.780
Go! Go!

34:15.150 --> 34:16.750
(groans)

34:20.890 --> 34:22.210
We got to get the general
out of here!

34:22.410 --> 34:23.970
And leave you here?
No way!

34:24.180 --> 34:25.740
ROBYN:
Look, we got to
keep him alive.

34:25.940 --> 34:27.880
All right? I'll lay down
cover fire. Go.

34:28.080 --> 34:29.410
I'll be back
as soon as I can.

34:29.610 --> 34:30.650
Now.

34:30.850 --> 34:32.700
General,
let's go, go, go!

34:44.280 --> 34:45.780
(woman screaming)

34:46.880 --> 34:48.220
(screams)

34:57.360 --> 34:59.210
MEL:
What happened?

34:59.410 --> 35:00.410
Fisk happened.

35:00.610 --> 35:02.960
Hey, Fisk...

35:05.500 --> 35:07.730
* *

35:19.710 --> 35:21.230
Are you kidding?

35:21.430 --> 35:23.850
You founded the Nomad project.

35:25.150 --> 35:27.140
I'm having trouble
hearing you, Mall Cop.

35:27.340 --> 35:29.770
"Thanks for saving my ass,"
is that what you just said?

35:29.970 --> 35:32.110
I wouldn't have needed saving
if you were there on time.

35:32.310 --> 35:34.480
Where the hell were you?
Testing out a theory.

35:34.680 --> 35:36.080
What theory?
I had a suspicion

35:36.280 --> 35:38.550
that Director Platt was
behind Nomad's reactivation,

35:38.750 --> 35:40.050
but I needed to find out.

35:40.250 --> 35:42.890
So I took your call about
General Stone in front of him.

35:43.090 --> 35:45.770
You wanted to show him
we were getting close.

35:47.140 --> 35:48.660
If he tried to stop you,

35:48.860 --> 35:51.430
then you would know
he was in on it.
Which he was.

35:51.630 --> 35:53.400
And he did.
He sent a team after me.

35:53.600 --> 35:54.730
Which is why you were late.

35:54.930 --> 35:56.670
So, what happened
to the team he sent?

35:56.870 --> 35:58.340
(chuckles softly)

35:58.540 --> 36:01.170
Fisk happened, huh?
Mm.

36:01.370 --> 36:02.920
I was ready for them.

36:03.960 --> 36:06.340
You think I, uh, carry
a flamethrower around

36:06.540 --> 36:07.810
with me just in case?

36:08.010 --> 36:10.510
Nothing you do
would surprise me.

36:10.710 --> 36:12.420
And that's not a compliment.

36:12.620 --> 36:14.080
(sighs)
So, now what?

36:14.290 --> 36:17.020
I notify the families of the
people Ruiz killed yesterday.

36:17.220 --> 36:19.560
Tell them just enough
to give them closure.

36:19.760 --> 36:21.090
I'll do the same
with your client,

36:21.290 --> 36:23.930
if you trust me enough
to let me know where he is.

36:24.130 --> 36:26.680
You do trust me
now, don't you?

36:28.550 --> 36:29.600
More than I did,

36:29.800 --> 36:31.670
which is not
saying much.

36:31.870 --> 36:34.540
But what about Nomad?

36:34.740 --> 36:36.240
We have to make sure
it's shut down.

36:36.440 --> 36:37.410
Permanently.

36:37.610 --> 36:39.040
Don't worry.

36:39.240 --> 36:41.680
After a failure that colossal,
anyone involved with Nomad

36:41.880 --> 36:44.280
will do whatever they can
to distance themselves.

36:44.480 --> 36:47.120
And whoever winds up getting
blamed will go to ground.

36:47.320 --> 36:50.250
And Director Platt?
We need to bury him.

36:50.450 --> 36:51.690
Ain't gonna happen.

36:51.890 --> 36:52.820
So, you're just gonna
let him get away with it?

36:53.020 --> 36:54.090
He's the head
of the CIA.

36:54.290 --> 36:56.160
You don't bury him.
He buries you.

36:56.360 --> 36:57.830
But he'll behave.

36:58.030 --> 36:59.600
Just knowing I
know what happened

36:59.800 --> 37:01.330
will keep him in line.

37:01.530 --> 37:03.300
You mean
it'll give you leverage.

37:03.500 --> 37:04.770
Checks and balances.

37:04.970 --> 37:07.000
It's what our constitution
is based on, right?

37:07.200 --> 37:10.090
You may be happy
playing those games...

37:11.590 --> 37:13.190
...but I'm not.

37:16.360 --> 37:19.420
You have a chip in
the big game, Mall Cop.

37:19.620 --> 37:22.100
Don't do anything rash.

37:31.480 --> 37:32.900
Hey, what
do you think?

37:33.100 --> 37:34.770
I'm debuting this
sweater tonight.

37:34.970 --> 37:35.930
I don't know,
it feels a little, uh...

37:36.130 --> 37:38.440
outré,
even for me, no?

37:38.640 --> 37:39.600
You know what?
What?

37:39.800 --> 37:42.840
I'd like it better
if it was, um...

37:43.040 --> 37:46.440
in a pile on the floor
with the rest of your clothes.
Wow.

37:46.640 --> 37:50.080
Mm-hmm.
Uh, you know,
we can, uh, stay in.

37:50.280 --> 37:51.680
ROBYN:
I'm not here.
I'm not nauseous.

37:51.880 --> 37:53.620
(Mel giggles)
Uh, hi. Hey.

37:53.820 --> 37:55.290
Uh, did you, uh, get
that file I sent you?

37:55.490 --> 37:58.020
I did. Great job.
All right. You were right.

37:58.220 --> 38:00.790
Everything of Platt's was
on his own private cloud,

38:00.990 --> 38:02.190
not on the CIA server.

38:02.390 --> 38:03.530
It's all in the file.

38:03.730 --> 38:04.630
I mean, it's better
than a signed confession.

38:04.830 --> 38:05.700
Did you get it
over to them?

38:05.900 --> 38:08.600
Me? Leak classified intel?

38:08.800 --> 38:10.600
The question is,
will they run it?

38:10.800 --> 38:12.940
Oh, we're about to find out.

38:13.140 --> 38:14.570
NEWS ANCHOR:
News alert.

38:14.770 --> 38:18.480
In a still developing story,
anonymous sources confirmed

38:18.680 --> 38:20.710
that an illegal CIA program

38:20.910 --> 38:22.650
has been caught
targeting American citizens

38:22.850 --> 38:24.280
right here on U.S. soil,

38:24.480 --> 38:27.920
all with the blessing of
CIA Director Thomas Platt.

38:28.120 --> 38:29.720
(laughing)
I don't believe it.

38:29.920 --> 38:31.560
NEWS ANCHOR:
The program known as Nomad...
(phone buzzing)

38:31.760 --> 38:33.520
Oh, like clockwork.

38:33.720 --> 38:35.230
Fisk.
MEL: Yeah.

38:35.430 --> 38:36.690
Someone's been busy.

38:36.890 --> 38:38.030
Say what you got
to say, Fisk.

38:38.230 --> 38:39.600
FISK (over phone):
What does it matter?

38:39.800 --> 38:42.700
Nomad's been exposed,
Director Platt's gonna resign.

38:42.900 --> 38:45.670
You got what you wanted.
I hope you're happy.

38:45.870 --> 38:47.740
I'm happier than I was
ten minutes ago.

38:47.940 --> 38:49.370
No, I get it.

38:49.570 --> 38:50.940
End of the day, we all have
our conscience to live with

38:51.140 --> 38:52.480
and now you can live with yours.

38:52.680 --> 38:55.380
So, you're not upset
about your coveted leverage?

38:55.580 --> 38:58.980
As the old saying goes, you
can't always get what you want.

38:59.180 --> 39:01.120
ROBYN:
Quite the sob story, right?

39:01.320 --> 39:03.720
Except we both know
that your old friend

39:03.920 --> 39:06.490
Assistant Director Greene
will probably be named

39:06.690 --> 39:07.760
the new CIA director.

39:07.960 --> 39:08.860
You think?

39:09.060 --> 39:10.030
Bodes well for you.

39:10.230 --> 39:11.260
Seeing how she owes you

39:11.460 --> 39:13.130
for all those favors
you did for her.

39:13.330 --> 39:15.370
You know what
your problem is, Mall Cop?

39:15.570 --> 39:17.470
Enlighten me, bro.

39:17.670 --> 39:18.740
You think too much.

39:18.940 --> 39:20.470
Got to lighten up.

39:20.670 --> 39:22.210
Have a beer.

39:22.410 --> 39:23.440
You've earned it.

39:23.640 --> 39:24.980
Well, thanks for
your permission.

39:25.180 --> 39:27.980
But my day's not over yet.

39:28.180 --> 39:29.980
I have one more stop to make.

39:30.180 --> 39:31.680
(TV anchor continues
indistinctly)

39:31.880 --> 39:33.930
* *

39:37.570 --> 39:39.510
Great, thanks.
BARTENDER:
Coming right up.

39:42.380 --> 39:43.430
DEVON:
Are you sure?

39:43.630 --> 39:44.900
It's definitely over?

39:45.100 --> 39:46.830
You don't have to be
afraid anymore.

39:47.030 --> 39:49.730
But the people
looking for me...?

39:49.930 --> 39:51.440
They've been brought
to justice.

39:51.640 --> 39:53.090
All of them.

39:54.090 --> 39:55.770
I still don't understand
what happened.

39:55.970 --> 39:58.070
Why it happened.
Listen...

39:58.270 --> 40:01.010
I don't have all
the answers, Devon.

40:01.210 --> 40:03.880
All I can say is that,
in the end,

40:04.080 --> 40:06.520
it had nothing
to do with you.

40:06.720 --> 40:09.450
Now, if that sounds crazy,
it's because it is.

40:09.650 --> 40:12.260
(sighs)

40:12.460 --> 40:13.620
Sorry.

40:13.820 --> 40:15.630
(chuckles) Move.

40:15.830 --> 40:18.010
Listen...

40:19.780 --> 40:22.430
My father used
to say to me,

40:22.630 --> 40:25.070
we can't control the
things that happen to us.

40:25.270 --> 40:27.540
Just the way
we react to them.

40:27.740 --> 40:29.040
WAITRESS:
There you go.

40:29.240 --> 40:31.090
("Many Rivers to Cross"
by Jimmy Cliff playing)

40:31.960 --> 40:34.190
You've got a new
lease on life.

40:36.760 --> 40:39.070
I hope you make
the most of it.

40:40.630 --> 40:42.290
Thank you.

40:42.490 --> 40:44.120
Really.

40:44.320 --> 40:45.540
Thank you.

40:48.070 --> 40:50.560
<i>(indistinct P.A. announcements)</i>

40:50.760 --> 40:51.700
(lock buzzes, latch clicks)

40:51.900 --> 40:55.820
* Many rivers to cross... *

40:57.120 --> 40:59.200
Congrats, Big Ben.

40:59.400 --> 41:01.770
What's the plan,
now that you're a free man?

41:01.970 --> 41:03.570
* My way over... *

41:03.770 --> 41:05.840
Never seeing
your ugly ass again.

41:06.040 --> 41:07.840
(chuckles)
No offense.

41:08.040 --> 41:11.200
* Wandering, I am lost *

41:12.170 --> 41:15.950
* As I travel along *

41:16.150 --> 41:20.110
* The White Cliffs of Dover *

41:21.210 --> 41:25.310
* Many rivers to cross *

41:26.280 --> 41:29.350
* And it's only my will *

41:30.280 --> 41:33.450
* That keeps me alive... *
GUARD:
Call you a ride?

41:34.620 --> 41:36.320
Nah.

41:37.490 --> 41:38.860
I'm good.

41:40.290 --> 41:44.110
* And I merely survive *

41:44.310 --> 41:48.100
* Because of my pride... *

41:50.870 --> 41:52.510
Need a lift?

41:54.310 --> 41:55.890
Told you I didn't
need anything.

41:56.090 --> 41:58.630
Well, I'm here anyway.

41:58.830 --> 41:59.760
Get in.

41:59.960 --> 42:02.520
* To be on your own *

42:04.450 --> 42:09.190
* My woman left
and she didn't say why *

42:11.290 --> 42:12.710
* Well, I guess I... *

42:12.910 --> 42:14.180
What are you doing here?

42:14.380 --> 42:17.260
With Mom out of town,
I figured you needed a ride.

42:18.230 --> 42:19.620
I was fine with walking.

42:19.820 --> 42:20.880
Twenty-three miles?

42:21.080 --> 42:24.050
Like I said, I was fine.

42:24.250 --> 42:27.160
But, since you insist,
you can drop me

42:27.360 --> 42:29.580
at the halfway house
on 57th.

42:30.880 --> 42:32.450
I could do that.

42:33.750 --> 42:35.320
Or...

42:36.450 --> 42:37.700
...we could stop
at the bar.

42:37.900 --> 42:39.770
BIG BEN:
Is that my pool cue?

42:39.970 --> 42:42.190
You kept it?

42:43.060 --> 42:44.910
So, what do you think?

42:45.110 --> 42:46.510
Shoot a few games,

42:46.710 --> 42:48.060
catch up?

42:51.700 --> 42:53.520
Yeah.

42:53.720 --> 42:55.500
I'd like that.

42:58.100 --> 43:02.960
* Wandering, I am lost *

43:03.160 --> 43:05.510
* As I travel alone. *
