Hiya. l said l'd help your Karen
with her homework.

02:17.320 --> 02:21.199
OK. Take your shoes off.

02:21.280 --> 02:24.238
- Fair enough.
- l'll get you a carrier bag.

02:32.400 --> 02:35.710
She's got this thing about people
bringing soil into the house.

02:35.800 --> 02:38.598
- Right.
- She's not as mad as she seems.

02:38.680 --> 02:42.150
- Agoraphobia.
- Oh, right.

02:42.240 --> 02:45.437
- So how come you know all this?
- lt's just something l do.

02:45.520 --> 02:47.636
- What, like a hobby?
- No.

02:47.720 --> 02:49.517
- The plans.
- What, physics?

but that were top fucking notch.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.992
Steve. l was gonna offer
to buy you a drink anyway.

05:36.040 --> 05:38.759
- Were you now?
- Yeah, l was, actually.

05:39.840 --> 05:43.230
- What do you reckon, Veronica?
- l don't know. Do l get one?

05:43.320 --> 05:45.675
Yeah, l think you will.

05:45.760 --> 05:49.639
- Snake bites all round, yeah?
- Maybe.

05:49.720 --> 05:52.917
No, no, no.
You're not getting back in like that.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.911
- What?
- Look at the state of him.

05:55.000 --> 05:58.310
State of you. lf you were doing your job,
he wouldn't have had to.

05:58.400 --> 06:01.278
- You fat twat.
- You're barred.

06:01.360 --> 06:03.430
- What for?
- Er...drugs.

06:05.200 --> 06:08.556
- He let them get away.
- Watch your mouth, spunk face.

06:08.640 --> 06:11.074
- Don't talk to her like that.
- Or what?

06:11.160 --> 06:13.230
Forget it. Let's get a taxi.

06:14.840 --> 06:17.832
- Thanks.
- Thanks anyway.

06:21.560 --> 06:23.312
(Both scream)

06:27.200 --> 06:30.715
- Come on!
- You fat wanker!

06:38.360 --> 06:40.794
(Lip) l got a blowjob today.

06:41.960 --> 06:44.554
What have you been told
about encouraging pets?

06:45.720 --> 06:49.395
- Karen Jackson.
- Yeah, right, Lip.

06:49.480 --> 06:52.916
She's desperate to get physics.
l didn't ask.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.594
l didn't even know
until she yanked it out.

07:00.960 --> 07:04.669
You'd have told me straightaway
if you would have been noshed.

07:04.760 --> 07:07.479
You ever had yours sucked?

07:07.560 --> 07:10.393
Well...once or twice.

07:11.320 --> 07:13.436
Didn't hear you telling me.

07:13.520 --> 07:18.071
How come, lan? A breakthrough like that,
if we tell each other everything...

07:21.240 --> 07:23.470
Unless you got it sucked by a bloke.

07:41.480 --> 07:44.756
(Sobs)

07:44.840 --> 07:48.389
What was it he called you?
A spunky monkey or something.

07:48.480 --> 07:52.678
lt wasn't me he called spunk face.
lt was her. l'm more of a juice face.

07:52.760 --> 07:55.513
- Not in front of the kids, mate.
- They've heard worse.

07:55.600 --> 08:00.116
- l get it off them.
- (Steve) Here's the spunky monkey.

08:00.200 --> 08:05.433
l nearly wet meself when
you whacked that guy. Well, l did a bit.

08:05.520 --> 08:07.954
He'll kill you if ever he sees you, Steve.

08:08.040 --> 08:09.917
Yeah?

08:11.240 --> 08:14.437
- How many people live here?
- l'm next door but one.

08:14.520 --> 08:17.751
But next door's dead
so l'm, erm...next door.

08:17.840 --> 08:20.513
- Yeah? Are you a nurse, Veronica?
- Er...part time.

08:20.600 --> 08:22.955
- (Fiona) You lying cow.
- She's a cleaner.

08:23.040 --> 08:26.350
(Veronica) They asked me
to train twice, at least.

08:26.440 --> 08:29.318
(Fiona) Just before they sacked you
for thieving.

08:29.400 --> 08:32.357
lf you're using stolen goods,
l'm on the blower.

08:32.440 --> 08:34.828
Will you shut up!
You don't even know him!

08:34.919 --> 08:36.797
Sit still.

08:36.880 --> 08:39.871
l would do if you stopped nudging me
with your knockers.

08:40.919 --> 08:43.229
- Argh, Jesus!
- Sit still!

08:43.320 --> 08:45.550
l'm Steve, by the way.

08:45.640 --> 08:47.949
Debbie.

08:48.960 --> 08:50.712
- Lip.
- Carl.

08:50.800 --> 08:53.234
- And that's lan.
- Hi, lan.

08:53.320 --> 08:55.356
Hey, Debbie, why do they call him Lip?

08:55.440 --> 08:58.193
A- you stink,
B- you're not as funny as you think,

08:58.280 --> 09:01.272
C- you whacked a bouncer
so you'll be dead soon.

09:01.360 --> 09:04.557
- (Debbie) Stuff like that.
- Yeah, boy meets death wish.

09:04.640 --> 09:07.438
We-hey! l thought you were fetching
an lndian home.

09:07.520 --> 09:09.875
l couldn't be arsed so l found a tax payer.

09:11.800 --> 09:13.791
- What's going on?
- We got turfed out.

09:13.880 --> 09:17.111
Steve stuck up for us. Decked a bouncer.

09:17.200 --> 09:20.556
- Which bouncer?
- Jimmy Clifton.

09:20.640 --> 09:21.993
Fuck me.

09:22.080 --> 09:24.036
(Fiona) Come on, you lot. Off to bed.

09:25.880 --> 09:28.474
- Bed.
- (Steve) Night, kids. See you later.

09:28.560 --> 09:30.710
- Bye!
- See you, love.

09:38.400 --> 09:41.676
- That's his?
- Yeah. Well, work's.

09:41.760 --> 09:45.469
- What kind of work?
- Car sales.

09:45.560 --> 09:48.518
- Where?
- l don't know. Didn't ask.

09:48.600 --> 09:50.431
l'm not as nosy as you.

09:50.520 --> 09:53.751
Oh, right. But you didn't mind
watching him take his shirt off.

09:53.840 --> 09:57.674
No. And if you hadn't walked in l'd have
tripped him up and dived under.

09:57.760 --> 09:59.716
Phwoargh! (Giggles)

10:19.880 --> 10:22.235
Right, straight answer.

10:22.320 --> 10:26.472
lf l hadn't busted my skull for you,
would you have looked twice?

10:26.560 --> 10:29.199
Who's saying l looked twice?

10:30.840 --> 10:33.070
You did then.

10:40.320 --> 10:42.356
l can't.

10:47.720 --> 10:52.635
99%/% of this world's problems are caused
by little words that come in pairs.

10:55.000 --> 10:58.072
We're healthy and we're happy

10:58.160 --> 11:02.676
and yet when anybody asks us,
we say, ''Not bad.''

11:05.680 --> 11:11.038
When l saw you for the first time,
dancing, about a month ago, by the way,

11:11.120 --> 11:13.953
l was desperate to buy you a drink.

11:14.040 --> 11:20.878
But you know what l said to myself?
''l can't. She won't. We wouldn't.''

11:22.640 --> 11:27.031
And then you're there again tonight
and me getting a second chance

11:27.120 --> 11:29.156
to make a good impression.

11:29.240 --> 11:32.789
So you say stop and l'll stop.

11:48.520 --> 11:50.476
Slower.

12:28.360 --> 12:31.557
Oh, yeah! Nearly! Nearly!

12:35.880 --> 12:38.075
- (Knocking)
- Shit!

12:38.160 --> 12:39.878
Shit!

12:57.600 --> 13:00.910
- Fiona in?
- Yeah. Er...yeah, she's upstairs.

13:04.280 --> 13:06.350
l'll just go get her.

13:11.640 --> 13:14.598
- Police.
- l know. l'll sort it.

13:18.720 --> 13:20.597
(Shouting) Go away!

13:20.680 --> 13:23.558
(Girl) Come here, Liam. Back to bed.

13:32.000 --> 13:36.039
l wouldn't put him anywhere near
a carpet until his kecks dry off a bit.

13:39.600 --> 13:42.478
(Steve) What the fuck's that?
(Fiona) lt's me dad.

13:48.600 --> 13:50.795
Thanks, Tony. l appreciate it.

13:50.880 --> 13:54.316
Cheers, Fiona. Night.

14:01.680 --> 14:04.831
- Hey, do you want a hand?
- No, you're all right.

14:17.800 --> 14:21.952
Do you, erm...
do you leave him there all night?

14:22.040 --> 14:24.759
He's never there when l get up.

14:27.440 --> 14:29.715
Who's the little 'un? Liam?

14:30.880 --> 14:32.916
Brother.

15:53.240 --> 15:55.959
(Knock at door,
washing machine spinning)

16:05.120 --> 16:07.190
(Steve) Hiya.

16:07.280 --> 16:11.068
Listen, erm... l'm wondering
how you're fixed for Friday.

16:12.120 --> 16:14.315
- Party.
- Great.

16:14.400 --> 16:17.073
- You wouldn't get invited.
- ls it a hen do?

16:17.160 --> 16:19.549
lt's just not that kind of party.

16:19.640 --> 16:22.632
Look, Steve, you're not that desperate.

16:22.720 --> 16:26.429
- Wanting to see you again is desperate?
- Feeling like you have to.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.309
You could get laid anywhere.

16:30.400 --> 16:33.392
So l'm only here for a fuck?

16:33.480 --> 16:35.471
Never crossed your mind?

16:37.800 --> 16:40.189
This is all a bit Hans Christian Andersen.

16:41.240 --> 16:44.789
You see, you think
you find your dream girl,

16:44.880 --> 16:47.553
then her incontinent alcoholic father
wrecks it.

16:47.640 --> 16:51.030
- Don't take the piss.
- Don't pretend you don't even know me.

16:51.120 --> 16:53.190
You weren't that drunk.

16:54.800 --> 16:59.237
lf the only reason last night happened
was because it happened,

16:59.320 --> 17:01.515
don't knock it, all right?

17:01.600 --> 17:03.670
At least something did.

17:05.359 --> 17:07.669
lt did for me.

17:07.760 --> 17:10.558
- Hey, it's the smart arse.
- Hey, it's the loser.

17:10.640 --> 17:13.598
- No school today?
- Two teeth out this morning.

17:13.680 --> 17:16.194
lf you're chewing,
don't just do it on one side.

17:16.280 --> 17:19.795
That can bugger your jaw
and that'll change the way you walk.

17:19.880 --> 17:22.109
- ls that a fact?
- lt's a skeletal fact.

17:22.200 --> 17:26.352
lf you talk out of your arse, you'll need
a bigger toothbrush. Anal fact.

17:26.440 --> 17:28.396
Cheers.

17:29.280 --> 17:31.077
Lip.

17:36.800 --> 17:39.234
(Machine restarts)

17:41.240 --> 17:43.549
Look...

17:44.400 --> 17:46.755
Thanks about the bag.

17:48.120 --> 17:51.510
- And stuff.
- (Steve laughs)

17:51.600 --> 17:55.593
- Stuff?
- l'm just not looking, Steve.

18:00.920 --> 18:03.195
l'm not having this.

18:03.280 --> 18:07.558
Look, just once, for me, then l swear
l'll shut up about everything.

18:07.640 --> 18:10.632
Swear though, Lip, then.

18:10.720 --> 18:13.154
Just try it. You might like it.

18:16.240 --> 18:18.117
Oh, she's thrilled with you.

18:18.200 --> 18:20.634
She got an A for her physics.

18:20.720 --> 18:23.518
Karen, it's your little helper!

18:23.600 --> 18:26.558
l'll get you carrier bags.

18:36.520 --> 18:38.078
(Man) Right, l'm off.

18:39.080 --> 18:43.119
Oh, hiya, lads. Where's our Karen?

18:43.200 --> 18:46.954
Out looking for a felt tip.

18:52.080 --> 18:54.799
Guess.

18:54.880 --> 18:57.155
- Tuna.
- Nope.

18:57.240 --> 18:59.390
- Corned beef.
- Nope.

18:59.480 --> 19:01.675
Kiss and l'll tell.

19:02.680 --> 19:05.638
l'll find out what l've got
when l eat 'em, won't l?

19:05.720 --> 19:09.759
Right, Karen, l'm late so l'm off.
See you in the morning, sweetheart.

19:26.160 --> 19:29.277
What are you hiding for?

19:33.240 --> 19:35.549
What's she hiding for?

19:39.200 --> 19:42.351
Oh, Jesus Christ, no.

19:42.440 --> 19:44.431
No!

19:44.520 --> 19:46.351
(Screaming)

19:47.920 --> 19:51.196
- What?
- He's gonna kill him!

19:53.800 --> 19:55.836
- He's gonna kill him!
- Who?

19:55.920 --> 19:58.195
- (Crash and thud)
- He's killed him.

20:06.720 --> 20:09.154
Come back here, you little animals!

20:12.800 --> 20:16.475
Round to ours. Top of the freezer.
Two ice collars.

20:16.560 --> 20:18.755
- Don't drop 'em. They can split.
- Right.

20:18.840 --> 20:21.752
Second cupboard above the sink -
liquid ibuprofen.

20:21.840 --> 20:24.308
freeze spray
and microthermal bandages.

20:24.400 --> 20:26.675
- Shouldn't he get it X-rayed?
- Grow up.

20:26.760 --> 20:30.116
He'll be there till midnight.
''Submetatarsal haematoma.''

20:30.200 --> 20:33.192
''Yeah, cheers, we knew that
five hours back.'' Fuck off.

20:33.280 --> 20:37.637
Microthermal bandages sizes eight
and ten. Could need either so bring both.

20:37.720 --> 20:40.473
- Right.
- And front bedroom, top of the video...

20:40.560 --> 20:43.120
- Yeah?
- ..fags and lighter.

20:47.200 --> 20:49.111
- (Knocking)
- l'm not here!

20:49.200 --> 20:51.111
Argh!

20:51.200 --> 20:53.714
Just say we're out
or you've never heard of us.

20:53.800 --> 20:55.916
What have you done?

21:03.600 --> 21:05.591
Get back up the stairs.

21:10.080 --> 21:12.469
Can l get through here?

21:12.560 --> 21:14.596
- Hey?
- Washer-dryer.

21:14.680 --> 21:16.477
Not me.

21:17.320 --> 21:20.995
- Gallagher, number 2?
- Yeah. But it's not ours.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.309
Where the fuck are you going with them?

21:40.400 --> 21:44.552
- Veronica wants them.
- Chuck us one over here.

22:02.280 --> 22:04.874
(Radio alarm)

22:10.720 --> 22:13.439
(Makes trumpet sound)

22:16.120 --> 22:18.156
Right.

22:22.800 --> 22:26.349
- l thought you'd no money.
- We haven't.

22:26.440 --> 22:28.476
These were inside it.

22:31.680 --> 22:33.716
''Steve.''

22:33.800 --> 22:35.518
- No!
- Yeah.

22:35.600 --> 22:38.114
- Who's Steve?
- Other night.

22:38.200 --> 22:40.156
- Never!
- l know!

22:40.880 --> 22:42.836
- You haven't got a vase.
- No.

22:42.920 --> 22:45.718
- Can l have them for doing Lip's leg?
- No.

22:47.120 --> 22:49.429
Just button it and follow me, will you?

22:49.520 --> 22:52.193
- l am! Fucking hell.
- Stop pulling it back.

22:52.280 --> 22:55.875
- l'm not pulling it back!
- l'm taking the strain on it, aren't l?

22:55.960 --> 22:59.839
(Debbie) Lip! Watch how many l can do.
Look. Look!

22:59.920 --> 23:04.471
15 years, l've done everything
in my power to... What did l tell you?

23:04.560 --> 23:08.678
Sow and thou shalt reap. Well, she didn't
reap that from me, did she?

23:08.760 --> 23:12.036
Reap what? What are you reaping now?

23:12.920 --> 23:16.549
Eddie, what if l try? Really try?

23:16.640 --> 23:18.870
Mum, don't beg him!

23:18.960 --> 23:21.269
lf the bastard can do this,
he's not worth it.

23:21.360 --> 23:23.669
- You watch your mouth.
- Get fucked!

23:25.760 --> 23:28.115
Don't try blaming me for this!

23:28.200 --> 23:31.033
You're your own worst enemies,
you two.

23:31.120 --> 23:35.033
They say bad things come in threes.
They don't. Twos. You twos.

23:35.120 --> 23:37.839
Now let me in or l'll tear this door off.

23:37.920 --> 23:39.911
(Karen) Sod off!

23:43.320 --> 23:45.675
(Mobile phone)

23:50.760 --> 23:52.955
(Fiona) 'How much have you paid for it?'

23:53.040 --> 23:55.838
Erm...l'm not gonna tell you that.

23:55.920 --> 23:59.276
'lt was a present
so you'd remember my phone number.'

23:59.360 --> 24:01.999
Which obviously worked.

24:02.080 --> 24:05.834
Your washer-dryer's in the back yard.
We don't want it, l don't need it.

24:05.920 --> 24:08.912
- So pick it up before it rots.
- 'ls it?'

24:11.160 --> 24:14.470
- Well, no.
- Did the guy connect it?

24:14.560 --> 24:16.357
Yes.

24:17.280 --> 24:20.909
- 'So it's working?'
- Yes.

24:23.040 --> 24:24.951
So you've tried it.

24:37.040 --> 24:39.270
- Smell your breath.
- Fuck off.

24:41.160 --> 24:43.196
- Pork scratchings.
- No, it's not.

24:44.080 --> 24:46.116
They were mine.

24:46.200 --> 24:49.476
See? l wouldn't mind
but scratchings aren't scratchings

24:49.560 --> 24:51.676
and they've never seen no pork.

24:51.760 --> 24:53.876
lan, l pay your wages.

24:53.960 --> 24:57.839
lf you catch him letting me down,
you'd better be straight on the mobile.

24:57.920 --> 24:59.797
Message received.

24:59.880 --> 25:02.348
lf you're not at that mosque
by midnight,

25:02.440 --> 25:04.635
you'll be in deep shit with your dad.

25:04.720 --> 25:09.157
- See you later, light of my life.
- l mean it. We're all watching you.

25:09.240 --> 25:11.276
See you at home.

25:13.160 --> 25:16.197
Can you earn your money
while you're taking the piss?

25:45.320 --> 25:47.959
Now you know what l feel like.

25:49.560 --> 25:51.869
Quit whingeing.

25:53.440 --> 25:55.829
Drink more.

25:55.920 --> 25:58.434
(Laughs)

26:11.160 --> 26:15.073
Mum, we've got to wear our shoes.
There's bits of glass you can't see.

26:21.120 --> 26:23.759
- (Lip) Cheers.
- Maybe Lip could do with a drink.

26:25.480 --> 26:29.268
Yes, sorry, Lip. lt's been a bit of
an off day today, hasn't it, Karen?

26:29.360 --> 26:32.318
So. Vodka, some tonic.

26:33.480 --> 26:35.914
Plenty of rum
but we're out of blackcurrant.

26:36.000 --> 26:38.036
- And gin.
- Just coffee, Mum.

26:38.120 --> 26:41.590
- (Tearfully) And a few lagers.
- Lager would be great. Cheers.

26:48.760 --> 26:51.991
- What if your dad comes back?
- He won't.

26:56.760 --> 27:00.275
- That's my fault.
- He's been looking for an excuse.

27:02.480 --> 27:04.550
Thanks.

27:07.000 --> 27:10.834
So, erm...what kind of impression
did you get of lan?

27:10.920 --> 27:13.195
He seems nice.

27:13.280 --> 27:16.317
- Hard?
- Couldn't tell. He didn't say much.

27:16.400 --> 27:18.311
No, l mean...

27:20.120 --> 27:23.635
- Did he get a hard-on?
- No.

27:45.840 --> 27:47.796
(Panting and moaning)

27:49.000 --> 27:51.036
(Man) Shh! Shh! Shh!

27:56.560 --> 27:59.632
Count the crisps again, lan,
and this time do it proper.

27:59.720 --> 28:03.110
And l'll do the peanuts, all right?
Jeez! Lip.

28:03.200 --> 28:06.829
Just, er... Cheers for the tools, Kash.

28:06.920 --> 28:09.480
Any time, eh? So long as l get 'em back.

28:09.560 --> 28:12.677
- So orange juice. Let's count...
- Two bottles.

28:12.760 --> 28:15.149
(Lip) Jesus Christ.

28:15.240 --> 28:17.708
Tell me you are taking the piss.

28:21.800 --> 28:24.519
You're fucking him?

28:24.600 --> 28:26.670
Him?!

28:30.080 --> 28:32.548
(Lip) Kash bought you the trainers,
didn't he?

28:40.400 --> 28:43.233
He's married. With kids.

28:44.280 --> 28:48.114
- What else does he buy you?
- Just stuff now and again.

28:51.200 --> 28:53.668
And you're happy with that?

28:54.640 --> 28:56.471
Eh?

28:58.200 --> 29:00.509
What does that make you?

29:00.600 --> 29:02.477
A fucking rent boy at best.

29:02.560 --> 29:06.109
Listen to me, bollock brains.
You crack on you know everything.

29:06.200 --> 29:10.239
And you know what? Ask me what
l've bought him. Go on. Ask me.

29:10.320 --> 29:13.551
Two Man United shirts, home and away,

29:13.640 --> 29:16.632
limited edition Beckham shin pads
for Christmas.

29:16.720 --> 29:19.996
So what does that make you, Lip, eh?
What does that make you?

29:20.080 --> 29:23.789
Wrong, that's what,
you smart arse, short arse fuck.

29:23.880 --> 29:27.953
So go round there now and promise
Kash you'll keep your mouth shut.

29:28.040 --> 29:31.635
Cos he's shitting himself
and he's done nothing - understand? -

29:31.720 --> 29:33.995
absolutely fuck all to be sorry for.

29:36.000 --> 29:39.072
Fake Muslim cheats
on white fundamentalist wife

29:39.160 --> 29:41.071
with gutless gay boy.

29:41.960 --> 29:45.475
Says more about United fans
than it does about the rest of us.

29:51.560 --> 29:54.233
(Music drowns out conversation)

30:38.160 --> 30:41.835
- Tell me you haven't got a girl pregnant.
- No danger.

30:41.920 --> 30:44.878
Not if that's all you end up being
to your kids.

30:47.840 --> 30:52.231
- Did he give you your dinner money?
- No, l'll pay it myself.

30:52.320 --> 30:54.311
No, you won't.

31:10.560 --> 31:12.471
There you go.

31:13.600 --> 31:16.751
You must be sick
of having to think for everybody.

31:19.320 --> 31:22.232
At least l can,
so it makes me feel wanted.

31:24.560 --> 31:27.313
lf the best you're aiming for
is wanting to be wanted,

31:27.400 --> 31:31.075
you've a job for life with that clown,
Fiona.

31:34.160 --> 31:36.071
Night.

31:53.520 --> 31:55.112
(Mobile phone)

32:05.800 --> 32:07.756
(Mobile phone continuing)

32:11.720 --> 32:15.554
- Hello.
- What was l wearing?

32:15.640 --> 32:18.712
- 'Wearing?'
- The first time you saw me.

32:20.800 --> 32:25.430
'You were wearing a pink top
and black trousers.

32:26.040 --> 32:28.156
'Cropped black trousers.

32:28.240 --> 32:32.995
'And you had dangling earrings.
Just one earring.

32:33.080 --> 32:35.355
'lt was a long, thin dazzler.

32:35.440 --> 32:41.356
'And you had your hair up in
these little clips. These rosy clip things.

32:41.440 --> 32:45.228
'And you were dancing next to
a red-haired girl in a green dress.'

32:45.320 --> 32:48.710
Gemma.
Who's a lot better looking than l am.

32:48.800 --> 32:51.633
- 'You reckon?'
- So why weren't you looking at her?

32:53.400 --> 32:56.517
Because you think like that
and Gemma doesn't.

32:56.600 --> 33:00.878
Gemma's dancing for an audience and
you're dancing like there's nobody there.

33:02.880 --> 33:06.839
Your life's not straightforward
and a bit of that travels with you

33:06.920 --> 33:09.434
but you don't stop it showing.

33:09.520 --> 33:12.273
'You're not fake. You're not vain.

33:12.360 --> 33:14.635
'You're not lost
so you don't need finding.

33:14.720 --> 33:17.473
'You're not trapped
so you don't need springing.

33:18.600 --> 33:21.512
'This town belongs to
the fucking Gemmas of this world

33:21.600 --> 33:24.956
'and l'm sick
of the fucking sight of them.'

33:25.040 --> 33:29.352
'l swear to God, Fiona, you're just...
You make me want to enjoy my life.'

33:31.120 --> 33:33.509
l've lost mates because l talk too much.

33:33.600 --> 33:38.310
But every time l try the opposite
l get accused of sulking so...

33:38.400 --> 33:41.392
Are you still there? Hello? Hello?

33:41.480 --> 33:43.630
Hello?

34:04.800 --> 34:06.472
(Steve) l knew you'd come.

34:06.560 --> 34:09.313
People like you are used to
getting your own way.

34:09.400 --> 34:11.550
Who are people like me?

34:12.520 --> 34:15.239
All right, agree or disagree.

34:16.520 --> 34:20.592
- He thinks the sun shines out his arse.
- Agree.

34:20.679 --> 34:23.831
- He's overgenerous and that bugs me.
- Agree.

34:23.920 --> 34:27.196
Because l'm not used to being spoiled.

34:27.280 --> 34:29.110
Agree.

34:29.960 --> 34:34.272
Nevertheless, he's overeducated
and he's got more money than sense.

34:34.360 --> 34:37.033
- Your words, not mine.
- But they fit.

34:37.800 --> 34:38.869
Agree.

34:38.960 --> 34:42.032
- He's had an easy life.
- Definitely.

34:42.120 --> 34:44.588
And l prefer a bloke
who's been around a bit.

34:44.679 --> 34:46.272
Maybe.

34:46.360 --> 34:49.830
- l can't help my upbringing.
- l'm not apologising for mine.

34:49.920 --> 34:52.434
Was l asking you to?

34:52.520 --> 34:55.080
- (Waitress) Finished?
- No.

34:56.199 --> 34:58.839
No, we're working on it.

35:00.080 --> 35:01.638
Please.

35:01.720 --> 35:04.598
Do you want to wait outside
while l take care of the bill?

35:04.680 --> 35:06.955
You can smoke there.

35:08.160 --> 35:09.354
Sure.

35:11.160 --> 35:13.071
Can l borrow your lighter?

35:20.640 --> 35:23.279
- Time to get your jacket, sir?
- Mm.

35:24.800 --> 35:26.392
Yeah, it is.

35:32.920 --> 35:34.273
(Classical music)

35:40.120 --> 35:42.759
Mr and Mrs Pace. You all right?

35:42.840 --> 35:45.798
How are you?
Lovely to have you back again.

35:45.880 --> 35:47.632
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thank you.

36:00.960 --> 36:03.076
(Mobile phone)

36:14.120 --> 36:16.076
Hello.

36:16.160 --> 36:19.038
(Steve) 'You seem a bit confused
about how l pay my way.

36:19.120 --> 36:23.477
'Well, you're the last person in the world
l need to confuse so here we go.

36:23.560 --> 36:27.997
'l don't buy and sell cars, l just sell them.

36:28.080 --> 36:31.311
'But they're not mine.

36:31.400 --> 36:33.630
'Satisfied?'

36:35.080 --> 36:37.036
No.

36:37.120 --> 36:41.511
They're really nice. They're really old.
They'll be dead soon.

36:41.600 --> 36:45.354
Look, he has beef,
gets blind drunk and swears a lot.

36:46.320 --> 36:48.515
'She can't drive
so he tears home pissed.'

36:49.440 --> 36:53.479
l'll be doing everybody a favour
by just taking them off the road.

36:53.560 --> 36:56.552
'Come on.
Do you fancy a laugh or not, Fiona?'

36:58.760 --> 37:00.796
This car's mine.

37:30.360 --> 37:33.193
Sounds like they're all in bed.

37:36.800 --> 37:38.438
Gotcha.

37:40.560 --> 37:43.279
Who's been eating my porridge, then?

37:45.320 --> 37:47.151
Hiya, Dad.

37:47.240 --> 37:49.196
- This is Steve.
- We've met but you...

37:49.280 --> 37:52.431
- How much do you weigh?
- Wouldn't know.

37:52.520 --> 37:55.512
- That'd fit me.
- lgnore him.

37:56.840 --> 37:58.956
Shift!

38:06.000 --> 38:09.037
Listen, l better get off
and let you get to bed, all right?

38:19.120 --> 38:21.270
Thanks.

38:21.360 --> 38:23.590
That was really nice.

38:23.680 --> 38:25.796
You too.

38:34.360 --> 38:37.397
What l want to know...

38:37.480 --> 38:42.190
Who...signed...for this?

38:54.440 --> 38:57.034
- What the fuck's he on?
- l think he bought Es.

38:57.120 --> 39:00.635
The only dealer he gets credit from
is a registered schizophrenic.

39:04.720 --> 39:08.918
lt's not a case of whether l agree, Steve.
lt's a fact.

39:09.000 --> 39:11.753
- lf l was a single parent...
- Aren't you?

39:11.840 --> 39:13.910
Yeah, but if l had tits.

39:14.000 --> 39:18.232
Yeah, but if l had tits, Steve,
they'd double the money.

39:18.320 --> 39:22.279
- With a bloke they don't fucking know.
- l get it, Frank, l get it.

39:22.360 --> 39:25.557
- lt's ''Prove you're looking for work.''
- And the rest.

39:25.640 --> 39:29.349
What was World War ll about
if blokes like me are still getting shit?

39:29.440 --> 39:32.716
Not ''How's a guy supposed to find work
with kids this age?''

39:33.640 --> 39:35.870
Correct. Hello!

39:36.680 --> 39:39.240
Oh! Good show. Well done.

39:39.320 --> 39:43.199
- Cos her mum, God rest her soul...
- Dad, don't start.

39:43.280 --> 39:45.555
Cos she'd better be dead, the cunt.

39:45.640 --> 39:49.519
- Cut it out!
- A four-month-old baby, Steve.

39:49.600 --> 39:51.989
A 16-year-old girl,
just had her appendix out.

39:52.080 --> 39:56.676
1 1-year-old Lip, 10-year-old lan,
7-year-old, 5-year-old.

39:56.760 --> 39:59.991
Oh, and an Escort van, calypso blue.

40:01.200 --> 40:03.395
What's the one thing we needed?

40:03.480 --> 40:05.948
One word. One thing.

40:06.040 --> 40:09.396
- Sterilisation.
- Continuity.

40:09.480 --> 40:11.038
Continuity.

40:11.120 --> 40:14.749
One Tuesday, right, we're out of bread,
so l send her down the shops.

40:14.840 --> 40:16.637
She grabs the van keys.

40:18.560 --> 40:23.759
l haven't seen it since. And we haven't
a fucking clue where she is, have we?

40:23.840 --> 40:27.230
Eh? We... Oh, l fucking love this.

40:27.320 --> 40:30.551
(Turns up the music volume)

40:31.600 --> 40:34.831
So what could l do, Steve?
What could l do?

40:34.920 --> 40:37.195
Vanish for three weeks.

40:37.280 --> 40:40.670
- l had a breakdown.
- (Fiona) You went on a bender.

40:40.760 --> 40:42.910
l had a nervous breakdown.

40:43.000 --> 40:44.797
Fair enough.

40:44.880 --> 40:47.155
- (Knocking)
- Dad.

40:47.240 --> 40:48.878
Keys.

41:06.760 --> 41:08.876
- Do you know what time it is?
- lt's Frank.

41:08.960 --> 41:11.076
- What have l told you?
- Oi!

41:11.160 --> 41:15.790
(Frank) Eh! Here we go.
Neighbours of Satan.

41:15.880 --> 41:19.270
The day you pay rent,
like some of us, Frank,

41:19.360 --> 41:21.555
you can play whatever shit you want.

41:21.640 --> 41:25.189
But till then,
if you're pumpin' it at this time of night,

41:25.280 --> 41:28.352
you play stuff that we like.

41:28.920 --> 41:30.797
All right?

41:30.880 --> 41:33.030
- Do you get it?
- l get it.

41:41.040 --> 41:42.951
Go on, get that down you.

42:09.080 --> 42:11.674
(Loud music and raucous laughter)

42:14.080 --> 42:16.355
He made me follow you up.

42:16.440 --> 42:18.317
l know.

42:19.160 --> 42:21.628
But he's right. You can't drive now.

42:24.600 --> 42:26.352
But...

42:28.800 --> 42:31.598
Liam is in here somewhere.

42:33.520 --> 42:35.795
Don't the kids wake up?

42:37.560 --> 42:39.710
Would you?

42:56.480 --> 42:58.436
(Car alarm)

43:04.200 --> 43:06.475
(Fiona)
lan, come and have your breakfast.

43:07.760 --> 43:10.797
- Have you seen lan?
- He'd gone before l woke up.

43:10.880 --> 43:12.916
His school uniform's not here neither.

43:25.440 --> 43:27.510
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

43:30.520 --> 43:32.431
Give me this.

43:39.200 --> 43:41.714
Tell me if you're not a morning person.

43:42.720 --> 43:45.871
lt's not something
l've had much experience of.

43:47.920 --> 43:50.354
First time for everything.

44:20.040 --> 44:22.190
How can that be good for you?

44:25.560 --> 44:28.711
- Or that.
- Do you know what's not funny?

44:28.800 --> 44:31.394
You. Ever.

44:42.120 --> 44:44.350
Anybody before Kash?

44:49.520 --> 44:51.875
- One.
- Who?

44:51.960 --> 44:53.757
l'm not telling you.

44:53.840 --> 44:57.799
And actually...up the arse?

44:57.880 --> 45:00.314
Cos... Look, l'm not taking the piss.

45:00.400 --> 45:04.916
l've come through a toilet roll. And that's
just one finger. Barely up the ring.

45:05.000 --> 45:07.389
Screamed the house down!

45:07.480 --> 45:09.789
Do you get used to that? Can you?

45:10.960 --> 45:14.794
The whole point of the digestive system
is about one-way traffic.

45:18.840 --> 45:20.876
lt just is.

45:20.960 --> 45:23.235
What?

45:23.320 --> 45:25.709
- What?
- You!

45:28.480 --> 45:30.072
''lt just is.''

45:31.640 --> 45:34.757
Like we're only given lungs
so we can fucking smoke.

45:43.240 --> 45:45.993
(Singing oom-pah song)

45:49.400 --> 45:52.676
- Sit yourselves down. Who's for bacon?
- All right.

45:54.680 --> 45:55.908
(Boy) Yummy!

45:56.000 --> 45:58.309
- What's all this?
- Well, er...

45:58.400 --> 46:01.073
Debbie's the only person
that gets up earlier than me

46:01.160 --> 46:04.197
so we shot off down to
Apu's on the corner.

46:04.280 --> 46:08.592
She said breakfast is her favourite meal
of the day and since it's her birthday...

46:08.680 --> 46:11.638
(Gasps) No, it's not!

46:12.640 --> 46:15.757
l didn't say it was, it said l wished it was.

46:15.840 --> 46:19.230
All right.
Sorry, completely misheard that, Debs.

46:19.320 --> 46:22.835
Perforated eardrum on the right. M'lady.

46:22.920 --> 46:25.229
- Anyone else want a drink?
- Who's for bacon?

46:25.320 --> 46:29.199
You got 15 minutes tops.
lan, Lip, your turn to wash up.

46:29.280 --> 46:32.590
Debbie, Carl,
you need to put them bins out.

46:32.680 --> 46:37.071
(Frank) 'Somebody said,
''Show me a child before he's seven

46:37.160 --> 46:39.310
'''and l'll show you the man.''

46:39.400 --> 46:42.472
'My problem with kids is
they're only seven once.

46:42.560 --> 46:45.791
'After that it's a fucking nightmare.
Massive!

46:45.880 --> 46:51.193
'One thing l'll say about my lot, though,
they've been raised to show respect.

46:51.280 --> 46:55.159
'And l like that. lt matters in our house.'

47:06.040 --> 47:07.871
Has anyone seen Dad since last night?

47:07.960 --> 47:11.077
(Frank) 'Six kids to keep on top of.'

47:13.280 --> 47:16.238
You can't file Frank as missing.
He's always missing.

47:16.320 --> 47:17.594
Ooh, that is tight.

47:19.760 --> 47:22.115
Sorry. Was my dad in the pub
this afternoon?

47:22.200 --> 47:24.031
Yeah, he were there. Slaughtered.

47:24.120 --> 47:26.190
How was he looking when you left him?

47:26.280 --> 47:28.510
He can't be far. He's never far.

47:28.600 --> 47:32.832
Police? l've just found a body
exactly fitting Frank's description.

47:32.920 --> 47:35.229
(Screaming)

48:13.040 --> 48:15.315
You might be getting...

48:15.400 --> 48:18.949
but you've got a long way to go
before you can catch up with...

48:35.720 --> 48:37.039
For fuck's sake!
