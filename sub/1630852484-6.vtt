more than their fair share

20:29.712 --> 20:30.877

20:30.897 --> 20:34.457
I, uh, volunteered
at an orphanage in Sinaloa

20:34.475 --> 20:36.083
for many years.

20:36.160 --> 20:38.218
And the parents would leave
their children there

20:38.296 --> 20:39.962
when they could
no longer support them.

20:39.964 --> 20:42.481
We did our best
to take care of them,

20:42.633 --> 20:44.057
but the one thing
that we couldn't do

20:44.135 --> 20:47.970
is to protect them
from the cartels.

20:47.972 --> 20:50.581
They would come
and pick off the kids

20:50.658 --> 20:53.584
that could earn them money
for prostitution,

20:53.736 --> 20:55.494
for the gangs,
all of that.

20:55.571 --> 20:58.905
And then when the children
are no longer of use to them,

20:58.925 --> 21:01.650
they kill them...

21:01.652 --> 21:03.427
and take their organs.

21:03.504 --> 21:07.247
And there's no amount
of praying that could stop it.

how much it costs?

24:09.264 --> 24:11.173

reunited with his family

24:14.011 --> 24:15.527

24:15.604 --> 24:17.196
Okay, but what--
what are you gonna do

24:17.272 --> 24:19.147
with his kidney
once it's removed?

24:19.200 --> 24:21.684
All of the organs
that are donated

24:21.686 --> 24:22.960
by people like José

24:23.111 --> 24:26.947
are given to people in need,
like you or your son.

24:26.966 --> 24:30.859
José goes on to live
his new life in America.

24:30.861 --> 24:32.878

a business, Thony.

24:33.030 --> 24:35.306

24:36.642 --> 24:40.202
All you have to do
is assist our lead surgeon.

24:40.221 --> 24:43.314
And then you'll be saving
the life of your son.

24:44.984 --> 24:47.401

24:49.304 --> 24:52.156

24:52.307 --> 24:53.657

25:37.928 --> 25:39.703

for Luca.

25:43.934 --> 25:45.358
(inhales deeply)
The only thing is,

25:45.436 --> 25:47.786
it's through an organ broker.

25:47.863 --> 25:49.380
What does that mean?

25:50.866 --> 25:52.532
It's not exactly legal.

25:52.626 --> 25:54.868
But is it safe?

25:54.945 --> 25:56.461
I saw her operating room.

25:56.614 --> 25:58.389
It's as equipped
as any hospital.

25:58.540 --> 25:59.557
Then what's wrong?

25:59.633 --> 26:02.467
The broker wants me
to perform surgery

26:02.544 --> 26:05.045
as a trade
for Luca's liver...

26:05.064 --> 26:07.064

26:07.215 --> 26:09.141
Three kidney removals
on immigrants

26:09.293 --> 26:11.360

to pay for their crossing.

26:14.815 --> 26:18.483

to sell their organs.

26:42.751 --> 26:45.327

26:45.346 --> 26:50.423

26:50.501 --> 26:52.109
