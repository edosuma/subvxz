WEBVTT

00:07.877 --> 00:11.359
Hey 'Lectric Leo fans,
it's Leo here, feeling angelish.

00:11.402 --> 00:12.577
"Angelish"?

00:12.621 --> 00:14.057
Damn it.

00:14.101 --> 00:15.493
All right.

00:15.537 --> 00:17.756
All right, come on,
nice and easy.

00:17.800 --> 00:19.236
Take two.

00:20.759 --> 00:22.065
Hey, it's 'Lectric Leo,

00:22.109 --> 00:23.545
with a little
shameless self-promotion

00:23.588 --> 00:25.895
to offer you
some heavenly discounts

00:25.938 --> 00:28.202
for all your home and commercial
electrical needs.

00:28.245 --> 00:31.248
So don't be a fallen angel,
call the number on your screen

00:31.292 --> 00:34.556
and "Let 'Lectric Leo
help you see the light."

01:14.378 --> 01:17.164
You would think, with all this
modern technology, paperwork

01:17.207 --> 01:19.079
- would be a thing of the past.
- PARKER:Right?

01:19.122 --> 01:22.082
What I'd give to never have
to file another TPS report.

01:22.125 --> 01:24.432
You do know it's
a TBS report, right?

01:24.475 --> 01:25.998
Trans Bureau Synopsis?

01:26.042 --> 01:27.478
What'd I say?

01:27.522 --> 01:29.263
A "TPS" report.

01:29.306 --> 01:30.481
Ah.

01:30.525 --> 01:32.831
Old habits. Weird.

01:32.875 --> 01:34.616
- Hey, yo.
- Hey.

01:34.659 --> 01:36.008
- Y'all been to Hawai'i?
- Yeah, a couple times.

01:36.052 --> 01:37.923
Can't wait to go. Why?

01:37.967 --> 01:40.578
Is Oahu and the Big Island
the same thing?

01:40.622 --> 01:42.928
Ooh, don't ask a Hawaiian that.

01:42.972 --> 01:44.191
Yeah, but if you're
planning a vacation,

01:44.234 --> 01:46.106
I hear Maui is amazing.

01:46.149 --> 01:47.542
No, it's not a vacation.

01:47.585 --> 01:49.239
I'm texting with Agent Tennant

01:49.283 --> 01:51.067
from, uh, the Honolulu office.

01:51.111 --> 01:52.416
A missing witness from
an old case of mine

01:52.460 --> 01:53.809
might have
turned up in Oahu

01:53.852 --> 01:55.289
and she's checking it out
for me.

01:55.332 --> 01:57.639
This is Jane Tennant?
From the, uh, conference

01:57.682 --> 01:59.336
in Orlando
a few years ago?

01:59.380 --> 02:00.859
That's where we met, yeah.

02:02.165 --> 02:03.427
But I don't recall
you being there.

02:03.471 --> 02:04.559
I wasn't,

02:04.602 --> 02:06.038
but, uh, I recall

02:06.082 --> 02:07.953
there being a little rumor
about you two.

02:07.997 --> 02:09.564
Rumor? No, no. No rumor.

02:09.607 --> 02:10.956
That's right.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.002
Thought I recognized
that name.

02:13.045 --> 02:15.613
Something about T'N'T?

02:15.657 --> 02:16.614
Not to be confused with TPS.

02:16.658 --> 02:18.312
What? T'N'T?

02:18.355 --> 02:20.662
What-what is that? What are you
guys even talking about?

02:20.705 --> 02:23.317
I don't know. I hear things.

02:23.360 --> 02:25.014
No, you don't hear things.
There are no rumors.

02:25.057 --> 02:27.408
And there's no T'N'T.
There is nothing.

02:30.715 --> 02:32.152
Parker. What's up?

02:32.195 --> 02:35.590
Retired Navy officer.
Possible suicide.

02:42.901 --> 02:45.252
On angel's wing.

02:46.296 --> 02:47.950
Like he planned it this way.

02:49.647 --> 02:52.215
Victim is retired Navy
Lieutenant Commander

02:52.259 --> 02:55.000
Thomas Miller, 35 years old.

02:55.044 --> 02:56.828
Tommy, yeah. Poor guy.

02:56.872 --> 02:58.830
- You knew him well?
- Uh, well enough.

02:58.874 --> 03:01.093
We worked a few
of the same jobs.

03:01.137 --> 03:02.530
He was installing
a water tank on the roof

03:02.573 --> 03:04.445
while I was wiring
security cams in the basement.

03:04.488 --> 03:06.708
- Had you seen him today?
- Just this morning when we got in.

03:06.751 --> 03:08.405
He went his way, I went mine.

03:08.449 --> 03:10.581
- How'd he seem?
- Stressed, as usual.

03:10.625 --> 03:12.148
He was always juggling
too many jobs.

03:12.192 --> 03:13.628
I called him to join me
for lunch,

03:13.671 --> 03:15.499
but he said "No, thanks"
and hung up pretty quick.

03:15.543 --> 03:17.675
Course, now I wished
I'd kept him talking.

03:17.719 --> 03:18.850
Okay, thanks.

03:18.894 --> 03:20.635
Help me turn him over.

03:20.678 --> 03:22.593
That roof's at least
a 60-foot drop.

03:22.637 --> 03:24.204
Mc
Just high enough.

03:26.684 --> 03:30.122
Hey, Jess?

03:30.166 --> 03:31.385
We know him?

03:34.344 --> 03:36.738
Oh, yeah, he does look
a little familiar.

03:38.435 --> 03:39.567
Oh, no.

03:39.610 --> 03:40.655
So, you do know him?

03:41.656 --> 03:43.397
Yeah, this guy's in our...

03:43.440 --> 03:45.355
in our, uh, class.

03:45.399 --> 03:46.487
What class?

03:46.530 --> 03:48.053
It's not a class, exactly.

03:48.097 --> 03:49.577
It's-it's more of a, uh...

03:49.620 --> 03:52.101
It's Jimmy's
grief counseling group.

03:52.144 --> 03:54.321
I've been going
for the past several weeks.

03:56.061 --> 03:57.846
Oh, I think that's great.

03:57.889 --> 03:59.456
You know, with what happened
with the REACT team

03:59.500 --> 04:01.719
and your wife, that
makes sense, yeah.

04:01.763 --> 04:04.287
Any idea why our
commander was going?

04:04.331 --> 04:06.071
Didn't he lose
a friend in combat?
Yeah, something like that.

04:06.115 --> 04:08.073
You never think it would
end up like this, though.

04:08.117 --> 04:09.423
More often than it should.

04:09.466 --> 04:10.467
Yeah, what's the national
average up to?

04:10.511 --> 04:11.468
Among vets?

04:11.512 --> 04:13.470
Any number's too high.

04:13.514 --> 04:15.994
Hold on. What's this?

04:16.038 --> 04:18.301
Blunt force trauma here,
on the forehead.

04:18.345 --> 04:19.737
Not caused by the fall?

04:19.781 --> 04:21.086
Well, I'll have to run
X-rays to be sure,

04:21.130 --> 04:22.827
but it sure looks
inconsistent to me.

04:22.871 --> 04:24.046
Race you to the roof, Torres?

04:25.265 --> 04:27.092
Hold on.

04:27.136 --> 04:29.007
What's this?
Again, Jimmy?

04:29.051 --> 04:30.008
What you got, the
murder weapon there?

04:30.052 --> 04:31.488
No, it's his cell phone.

04:31.532 --> 04:34.752
Five missed calls this morning.

04:37.538 --> 04:38.843
Mc
It's Fornell.

04:49.376 --> 04:51.943
We found six metal pipes and
some plumbing tools on the roof.

04:51.987 --> 04:53.162
Kasie has them now.

04:53.205 --> 04:54.729
No sign of struggle up there.

04:54.772 --> 04:56.078
And no security cameras.

04:56.121 --> 04:57.645
Jimmy just confirmed
that the blunt force

04:57.688 --> 04:59.516
was delivered before
the commander

04:59.560 --> 05:01.170
was thrown from the roof.

05:01.213 --> 05:02.476
Anything else we should know?

05:02.519 --> 05:03.781
Mc
Well, Miller was a decorated

05:03.825 --> 05:04.782
helicopter pilot
with multiple tours

05:04.826 --> 05:06.393
in the Middle East and Africa.

05:06.436 --> 05:09.134
Retired two years ago, after
flying one last mission

05:09.178 --> 05:11.833
in South Sudan,
which ended in a fatal crash.

05:11.876 --> 05:13.225
Mc
Sandstorm.

05:13.269 --> 05:14.705
Miller and two others
were wounded,

05:14.749 --> 05:16.272
and one other young
petty officer was killed.

05:16.316 --> 05:18.579
And it haunted Tommy ever since.

05:18.622 --> 05:20.494
I still can't believe this.

05:20.537 --> 05:22.234
You know for sure
that he didn't jump?

05:22.278 --> 05:24.889
Right? I-I really thought
we were making progress.

05:24.933 --> 05:26.674
Hey, Fornell.
What do you mean "we"?

05:26.717 --> 05:28.328
I was Tommy's grief sponsor.

05:29.416 --> 05:31.287
Someone to hold you accountable

05:31.331 --> 05:33.158
and to call for support.

05:33.202 --> 05:34.986
It's good to see
you here, Alden.

05:35.030 --> 05:36.597
Yeah, it was, uh,

05:36.640 --> 05:40.209
you calling him,
five times this morning.

05:40.252 --> 05:42.733
Yeah. I wish I'd
called him ten times

05:42.777 --> 05:45.170
after this message
that he sent me.

05:45.214 --> 05:48.826
Hey, Tobias, it's Tommy.

05:48.870 --> 05:51.046
Look, I'm in a really tough spot

05:51.089 --> 05:54.092
and, uh, I could sure
use some advice.

05:54.136 --> 05:55.398
Call me back when you can.

05:55.442 --> 05:56.486
Thanks.

05:58.445 --> 06:00.229
Any idea what he was
- talking about?
- None.

06:00.272 --> 06:02.710
He was carrying around a lot
of guilt, but I'd never think

06:02.753 --> 06:04.146
that someone was out
to kill him.

06:04.189 --> 06:05.365
So no enemies

06:05.408 --> 06:06.670
- spring to mind?
- No.

06:06.714 --> 06:07.628
I've heard nothing
but raves about

06:07.671 --> 06:09.412
his family, his friends.

06:09.456 --> 06:11.806
The guy had
a-a great support system.

06:11.849 --> 06:14.417
Well, speaking of family,
his wife and brother-in-law

06:14.461 --> 06:16.506
- are in the lobby.
- Interview them together?

06:16.550 --> 06:17.855
Well, if it was suicide, sure,

06:17.899 --> 06:19.944
but in this case,
let's split them up.

06:19.988 --> 06:21.206
Great. I'll take the wife.

06:23.252 --> 06:24.384
What?

06:26.473 --> 06:29.911
I was Tommy's grief sponsor.
I should be part of this.

06:29.954 --> 06:32.087
Uh, yeah, no, Tobias.

06:32.130 --> 06:34.219
Not that we don't
appreciate it, but...

06:34.263 --> 06:35.438
Gibbs would let me help.

06:35.482 --> 06:37.222
No, he wouldn't.

06:37.266 --> 06:39.442
KNIGHT:Besides, you've-you've
already helped.

06:39.486 --> 06:40.487
Mc
Yeah, why don't

06:40.530 --> 06:41.749
you guys go? I'll, uh...

06:41.792 --> 06:43.403
I'll comb through
Miller's calls.

06:50.105 --> 06:51.933
Well, Tobias, I'd, uh,

06:51.976 --> 06:55.458
ask for your help, but, you
know, it's, um, computer stuff.

06:55.502 --> 06:57.112
Enjoy it.

06:57.155 --> 06:59.723
I've got sadder things
to do anyway.

07:02.509 --> 07:04.467
You can't blame yourself, Tobias.

07:04.511 --> 07:06.643
I don't, I'm just...

07:06.687 --> 07:10.865
You ever stop to think
just how much death

07:10.908 --> 07:13.650
you and I have experienced?

07:13.694 --> 07:17.262
Both personally
and professionally?

07:17.306 --> 07:18.568
Constantly.

07:18.612 --> 07:21.789
But as Dr. Grace would say...

07:21.832 --> 07:24.139
Death touches us all eventually,

07:24.182 --> 07:26.489
and with apologies to taxes,

07:26.533 --> 07:30.972
that is life's one
true certainty.

07:31.015 --> 07:33.104
- Thanks for coming, Doctor.
- Yeah, thanks for calling me,

07:33.148 --> 07:35.542
although I hate to break up
this self-pity party.

07:35.585 --> 07:37.282
Party's over.

07:37.326 --> 07:39.502
Everybody okay?

07:39.546 --> 07:40.503
Better than him.

07:40.547 --> 07:42.679
Oh, Tommy.

07:44.768 --> 07:46.466
I'm so sorry.

07:46.509 --> 07:47.510
You know,
he didn't kill himself.

07:47.554 --> 07:48.555
Yes, no matter.

07:48.598 --> 07:50.426
I have my regrets.

07:50.470 --> 07:53.124
That our group maybe
never quite reached him

07:53.168 --> 07:55.605
or got him to forgive himself.

07:55.649 --> 07:57.346
Forgive himself
for what?

07:57.389 --> 07:59.957
Uh, Tommy never
really shared all that much.

08:00.001 --> 08:02.003
What exactly happened?

08:03.265 --> 08:05.572
Tommy may have been a war hero,

08:05.615 --> 08:08.313
but losing Sally
just destroyed him.

08:08.357 --> 08:11.882
That's, uh, Petty Officer
Third Class Sally Jordan?

08:11.926 --> 08:15.669
She was a just a kid.
Entrusted to his command.

08:15.712 --> 08:19.411
Until a storm hit
and his helo stalled.

08:21.370 --> 08:23.503
Tommy and the others
were thrown clear...

08:24.634 --> 08:26.549
...but Sally wasn't so lucky.

08:26.593 --> 08:28.116
You say it like you were there.

08:28.159 --> 08:29.552
Felt like I was.

08:29.596 --> 08:31.293
Tommy relived it

08:31.336 --> 08:34.035
every day and too many nights.

08:35.993 --> 08:37.647
He just couldn't shake the loss.

08:37.691 --> 08:39.606
When did you last see
your husband?

08:39.649 --> 08:40.955
Two days ago.

08:42.652 --> 08:44.828
Two whole days?

08:46.526 --> 08:48.702
The man buried himself
in his work.

08:48.745 --> 08:50.791
Gone for days at a time,

08:50.834 --> 08:52.575
traveling to wherever
the jobs were.

08:52.619 --> 08:53.968
How often did you see him?

08:54.011 --> 08:58.625
Mm, between that,
his group counseling

08:58.668 --> 09:02.280
and his private sessions with
Dr. Grace three times a week,

09:02.324 --> 09:03.499
a lot less than I wanted.

09:03.543 --> 09:04.587
I went along with it,

09:04.631 --> 09:07.068
thinking it would help, but...

09:08.112 --> 09:10.680
Did Tommy have any enemies?

09:10.724 --> 09:12.552
No.

09:14.379 --> 09:15.903
Why would you even ask that?

09:15.946 --> 09:17.121
Murdered?

09:17.165 --> 09:19.210
I thought he jumped.

09:19.254 --> 09:21.517
So did we, at first. But now...

09:21.561 --> 09:23.475
Oh, my God.

09:23.519 --> 09:25.826
I mean, who would kill...

09:25.869 --> 09:28.785
Wait, is-is that why my sister's
alone in the room?

09:28.829 --> 09:30.439
Like she isn't crushed
enough, you're-you're gonna

09:30.482 --> 09:32.180
accuse her of killing
her husband?

09:32.223 --> 09:33.921
Nobody is accusing anyone yet.

09:33.964 --> 09:36.140
But immediate family,
like yourself,

09:36.184 --> 09:37.577
that's usually where we start.

09:37.620 --> 09:38.665
Well, you-you can check
with my boss.

09:38.708 --> 09:40.144
I've been at work all day.

09:40.188 --> 09:41.232
And your sister?

09:42.277 --> 09:43.321
I was pulling

09:43.365 --> 09:45.062
a double at the supermarket.

09:45.106 --> 09:47.935
The police called in the middle
of my afternoon shift.

09:47.978 --> 09:49.066
And your brother?

09:49.110 --> 09:50.938
Marty loved Tommy.

09:50.981 --> 09:52.592
Like my own brother.

09:52.635 --> 09:55.464
Before his last tour,
with the accident and all,

09:55.507 --> 09:57.640
Tommy was a really fun guy.

09:57.684 --> 09:59.511
So, as brothers,

09:59.555 --> 10:02.602
he never mentioned any
enemies or conflicts to you?

10:02.645 --> 10:04.168
Not to me.

10:04.212 --> 10:06.431
I mean, but he's-he's
different now.

10:06.475 --> 10:09.957
Or he was.
We didn't talk as much.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.002
Your husband left a message
with a friend

10:12.046 --> 10:14.875
a few hours before he died,
saying he was in "a tough spot."

10:14.918 --> 10:16.267
OLIVE:He did?

10:16.311 --> 10:18.139
He sounded fine
when I spoke to him,

10:18.182 --> 10:19.314
around 10:00.

10:19.357 --> 10:22.796
Whoa, what about the old man?

10:22.839 --> 10:24.145
What old man?

10:24.188 --> 10:26.277
The-the dead girl on his team,
her dad?

10:26.321 --> 10:27.670
Tommy had a restraining order.

10:27.714 --> 10:29.193
A restraining order?

10:29.237 --> 10:31.761
Sally's father was devastated.

10:31.805 --> 10:33.023
So he threatened to kill Tommy,

10:33.067 --> 10:34.938
but that was well
over a year ago.

10:34.982 --> 10:37.419
Tommy was blaming
himself so bad,

10:37.462 --> 10:40.161
he could hardly fault
the old man for hating his guts.

10:40.204 --> 10:41.423
But I can't imagine <i>
that he would</i>

10:41.466 --> 10:42.554
do something like this.

10:43.555 --> 10:44.644
Would he?

10:46.733 --> 10:48.125
All right, <i>
let's check their alibis</i>

10:48.169 --> 10:50.650
and get all we can
on this angry father.

10:51.738 --> 10:53.565
Dr. Grace, hey.

10:53.609 --> 10:55.002
Oh, hi, Jess, Nick.

10:55.045 --> 10:56.177
Hey, what brings you out here?

10:56.220 --> 10:57.395
She leads our grief group.

10:57.439 --> 10:58.701
Mc
Uh, she also agreed

10:58.745 --> 10:59.920
to help us with the Miller case.

10:59.963 --> 11:01.312
Yes, anything I can do.

11:01.356 --> 11:04.185
And, um, as long as I'm here,

11:04.228 --> 11:06.187
consider this
a friendly reminder

11:06.230 --> 11:07.318
that you still owe me

11:07.362 --> 11:08.972
a mandatory psych evaluation,

11:09.016 --> 11:11.105
- post-
- Fight Club.

11:11.148 --> 11:12.976
Oh, please.

11:13.020 --> 11:15.196
I really don't need evaluating.

11:15.239 --> 11:16.893
Just get it done, Torres.

11:16.937 --> 11:19.113
Which would make you
Agent Parker?

11:19.156 --> 11:20.984
The graceful Dr. Grace.

11:21.028 --> 11:22.594
You two don't know each other?

11:22.638 --> 11:24.422
Crazy, right?

11:24.466 --> 11:28.122
Uh, how many months has it been
since he joined NCIS,

11:28.165 --> 11:29.732
and Parker still owes me

11:29.776 --> 11:31.473
a prelim psych eval.

11:31.516 --> 11:32.561
I've been a little busy.

11:32.604 --> 11:34.128
Oh, just get it done, Parker.

11:34.171 --> 11:36.478
I will.
I happen to love therapy.

11:36.521 --> 11:38.088
Uh, not therapy.

11:38.132 --> 11:39.394
Just an evaluation.

11:39.437 --> 11:40.743
Then I love that, too,
but first,

11:40.787 --> 11:42.484
anything yet
on our petty officer?

11:42.527 --> 11:44.094
Quite a bit, actually.

11:44.138 --> 11:46.401
Here's the crew from
Commander Miller's last flight,

11:46.444 --> 11:48.142
originating out
of Camp Lemonnier.

11:48.185 --> 11:50.710
That is Petty Officer Jordan
standing next to Miller.

11:50.753 --> 11:52.233
She really is just a kid.

11:52.276 --> 11:53.756
Yeah, their youngest member,

11:53.800 --> 11:55.671
which is why her loss
was so hard on Tommy.

11:55.715 --> 11:57.107
Yeah, enough to send him
to therapy

11:57.151 --> 11:58.718
with you three days
out of the week.

11:58.761 --> 12:00.763
Three?

12:00.807 --> 12:02.112
That's what his wife said.

12:03.723 --> 12:06.116
Tommy attended
our weekly groups,

12:06.160 --> 12:08.031
but I had only two
private sessions with him

12:08.075 --> 12:09.511
in the last four months.

12:09.554 --> 12:11.382
Well, if he lied to his wife
about that,

12:11.426 --> 12:13.080
what else was he lying about?

12:13.123 --> 12:14.603
Well, here's one
possible answer.

12:14.646 --> 12:15.952
Miller received eight calls
from the same

12:15.996 --> 12:18.172
blocked number
in the past two days.

12:18.215 --> 12:20.174
- I trust you unblocked it.
- And I already traced it

12:20.217 --> 12:22.567
to an R. Jordan
of Falls Church, Virginia.

12:22.611 --> 12:23.960
Father of our dead
petty officer?

12:24.004 --> 12:25.875
I got him here.
He's listed as Richard Jordan,

12:25.919 --> 12:28.138
62, widowed.

12:28.182 --> 12:30.793
And according to his records,
the restraining order

12:30.837 --> 12:34.666
Miller took out on him
expired just last week.

12:34.710 --> 12:38.148
So, who's up for a chat
with Dad?

12:39.454 --> 12:42.196
Your turn to be the bad cop.

12:42.239 --> 12:43.806
Yeah, I don't know. This
guy lost his daughter.

12:43.850 --> 12:45.460
Maybe we're both
good cops here.

12:47.767 --> 12:49.203
Oh, nice.

12:49.246 --> 12:51.945
Tennant might have found
my missing witness.

12:51.988 --> 12:54.817
Hey, so, are the
rumors not true, then,

12:54.861 --> 12:58.081
about you guys jumping off
a balcony into a hotel pool?

12:58.125 --> 13:00.170
It wasn't that high
of a balcony.

13:01.389 --> 13:03.173
Come on, man.
Well, we shared, uh...

13:03.217 --> 13:04.958
We shared a few laughs.

13:05.001 --> 13:08.352
All right?
But the rumors have been, uh,

13:08.396 --> 13:10.180
completely exaggerated.

13:18.841 --> 13:20.060
Mr. Jordan?

13:21.409 --> 13:23.063
Yeah? Who...

13:23.106 --> 13:25.413
What do you want? Who are you?

13:25.456 --> 13:28.024
Special Agent Torres
and McGee from NCIS.

13:28.068 --> 13:30.548
We need to ask you a few
questions about Thomas Miller.

13:30.592 --> 13:31.898
It's about time.

13:31.941 --> 13:33.900
I got a few questions
for him, too.

13:33.943 --> 13:34.901
Is that why
you called him

13:34.944 --> 13:36.163
eight times in two days?

13:36.206 --> 13:38.730
He wouldn't call me back.

13:38.774 --> 13:42.169
He won't be calling
you back anymore.

13:42.212 --> 13:43.735
He's dead.

13:43.779 --> 13:45.476
What?

13:45.520 --> 13:47.652
Yeah, w-- What killed him?

13:47.696 --> 13:49.132
That's what we're here
to find out.

13:49.176 --> 13:51.656
It's not about
what killed him, but who.

13:52.962 --> 13:55.965
Well, if that's the case,

13:56.009 --> 13:58.620
I might have a pretty good idea.

14:09.849 --> 14:12.068
McYou said you might know
who killed Thomas Miller?

14:12.112 --> 14:14.375
"Might" means maybe.

14:14.418 --> 14:16.203
Hold on, let me
pull it up here.

14:16.246 --> 14:18.814
Here. Here you go.

14:18.858 --> 14:20.903
Take a look at that.

14:20.947 --> 14:23.297
"Your daughter is
alive. We have her.

14:23.340 --> 14:25.865
For 50,000 American dollars,
we will release her."

14:27.301 --> 14:29.390
It's crazy, right?

14:29.433 --> 14:31.131
They want it sent to an offshore
account in the Seychelles.

14:31.174 --> 14:33.046
Mr. Jordan, I'm afraid
that sounds like a scam.

14:33.089 --> 14:35.309
I know it's a scam.
I got my little girl's ashes

14:35.352 --> 14:36.527
right there in the box
to prove it.

14:36.571 --> 14:38.529
What I can't figure out

14:38.573 --> 14:42.882
is how these creeps got ahold
of her phone to text me from.

14:42.925 --> 14:44.666
Well, unfortunately,
there's some creeps out there

14:44.709 --> 14:46.755
that are capable
of cloning cell phones.

14:46.798 --> 14:48.235
All to score
a few bucks

14:48.278 --> 14:49.976
from grieving military families.

14:50.019 --> 14:51.368
They did a hell
of a job of cloning.

14:51.412 --> 14:53.153
They were able to tag
onto a thread

14:53.196 --> 14:55.068
that Sally and I
had going

14:55.111 --> 14:56.373
just before she...

14:56.417 --> 14:58.332
Yeah.

14:58.375 --> 15:00.943
This is the last text
she sent me from two years ago.

15:00.987 --> 15:02.118
Wish me luck, Daddy,

15:02.162 --> 15:03.859
we got a big mission coming up.

15:03.903 --> 15:06.514
Oh, hey. Commander,
you want to say hi to my dad?

15:06.557 --> 15:08.081
Did you get a call through?

15:08.124 --> 15:09.691
No, I'm just
sending him a video.

15:09.734 --> 15:12.563
Hey, call him Big Rick, okay?
Everybody does.

15:12.607 --> 15:14.261
You did a great job
raising this one, Big Rick.

15:14.304 --> 15:16.480
Your girl's in good hands.
We'll get her home safe.

15:17.873 --> 15:20.571
See what I mean? Tough but cool.

15:20.615 --> 15:21.964
Anyway, I got to go.

15:22.008 --> 15:23.270
I'll send you another
message tomorrow.

15:23.313 --> 15:24.967
Love you, Daddy.

15:29.145 --> 15:31.060
She was gone the same night.

15:31.104 --> 15:33.976
He never should've been
flying during that sandstorm.

15:34.020 --> 15:35.325
He knew better.

15:35.369 --> 15:36.936
Well, we-we understand
why you were angry.

15:36.979 --> 15:38.589
I wasn't angry.

15:38.633 --> 15:41.462
He broke the biggest promise
a man could ever make.

15:41.505 --> 15:43.768
I wanted the son
of a bitch dead.

15:43.812 --> 15:45.422
Until he filed a restraining
order against you.

15:45.466 --> 15:48.425
Yeah, yeah, and I'm glad he did.

15:48.469 --> 15:50.427
It helped me get
my head on straight.

15:50.471 --> 15:53.648
Until these scumbags came
and tore the scab off the wound.

15:53.691 --> 15:56.085
Well, it still doesn't explain
all the calls to Miller

15:56.129 --> 15:57.565
after the order was lifted.

15:57.608 --> 15:59.567
I needed his help. I
didn't know what to do.

15:59.610 --> 16:02.091
I figured if there's anybody
that owed me, it was him.

16:02.135 --> 16:03.571
Where were you at 10:00 a.m.
this morning?

16:03.614 --> 16:04.920
I was right here.

16:04.964 --> 16:07.009
Yeah, thing about
these scammers,

16:07.053 --> 16:08.402
if they could get to me...

16:09.881 --> 16:12.754
...how much worse
it would be for Miller.

16:12.797 --> 16:15.148
It sounds to me like
maybe they did.

16:18.064 --> 16:20.457
You know what, I think...
I think "maybe" is right.

16:20.501 --> 16:23.895
Why don't you let me clone
your SIM card onto my laptop?

16:23.939 --> 16:25.375
I'll see what I can find, okay?

16:30.163 --> 16:31.512
I don't know, <i>
this stuff sure reads</i>

16:31.555 --> 16:34.036
like one of those
Nigerian prince scams.

16:34.080 --> 16:35.646
Or some creep
in a basement who gets off

16:35.690 --> 16:37.126
on rubbing salt
into other people's wounds.

16:37.170 --> 16:39.041
That's what I was thinking.

16:39.085 --> 16:40.825
I don't know, records show that
Petty Officer Jordan's remains

16:40.869 --> 16:43.132
were recovered at the crash,
but not her cell phone.

16:43.176 --> 16:44.568
Scammers could've found it.

16:44.612 --> 16:46.092
- So you think you can track it?
- I would like

16:46.135 --> 16:48.007
to at least try, yeah;
and who knows, you know,

16:48.050 --> 16:50.009
maybe we find these scammers,
that could be our connection.

16:50.052 --> 16:51.314
All right, you do
that, the rest of us

16:51.358 --> 16:53.055
will focus on
gathering suspects.

16:54.448 --> 16:55.971
Oh, it's Hawai'i.

16:56.015 --> 16:57.886
Might be time to, uh, have
a phone call with Tennant.

16:57.929 --> 16:59.888
She beat you do it,
Agent Torres.

16:59.931 --> 17:01.020
MTAC.

17:01.063 --> 17:02.064
You, too, Agent Parker.

17:02.108 --> 17:03.848
Don't forget your T'N'T.

17:03.892 --> 17:05.546
Oh, God.

17:05.589 --> 17:07.896
Well, is it just me, Nick,
or have those D.C. winters

17:07.939 --> 17:10.464
been rough on you?
No, Jane, it's just you.

17:10.507 --> 17:11.943
But all that surfing
and sunshine

17:11.987 --> 17:13.467
looks pretty good on you.

17:13.510 --> 17:15.295
Well, so much for that intro,
Special Agent Tennant,

17:15.338 --> 17:17.906
but I don't think you know
Special Agent Parker.

17:17.949 --> 17:19.255
No, but I hear great things.

17:19.299 --> 17:21.257
And I hear you run a tight ship.

17:21.301 --> 17:22.737
We do what we can.

17:22.780 --> 17:24.130
So, if memory serves,
this is about

17:24.173 --> 17:26.393
a munitions explosion
in Afghanistan?

17:26.436 --> 17:27.742
Yes, sir, five years ago,
and that case

17:27.785 --> 17:29.483
has been eating at me
ever since.

17:29.526 --> 17:30.875
The explosion
was ruled an accident,

17:30.919 --> 17:32.747
with a private contractor
taking the blame,

17:32.790 --> 17:35.315
only to then die
in a car crash weeks later.

17:35.358 --> 17:36.664
Which seemed way too convenient,

17:36.707 --> 17:38.796
but I could never
prove any foul play.

17:38.840 --> 17:41.103
Until I got some fresh intel
about a missing witness.

17:41.147 --> 17:42.539
Kyle Jennings.

17:42.583 --> 17:45.281
Whom I've just
now located in Oahu.

17:45.325 --> 17:47.370
I'd be happy to scoop him up
on your say-so.

17:47.414 --> 17:50.156
Actually, Director,
since it's still my case...

17:51.461 --> 17:53.246
I'd like to, uh,
put this one to bed myself.

17:53.289 --> 17:55.770
I'm sure. In Hawai'i.

17:55.813 --> 17:58.164
Got to admire your dedication.

17:58.207 --> 18:00.166
For what it's worth, Director,

18:00.209 --> 18:03.386
we don't know this witness,
and Torres does.

18:03.430 --> 18:05.084
Wouldn't hurt to have him.

18:06.172 --> 18:07.912
How about it, Parker?
Can you spare him?

18:07.956 --> 18:09.523
Well, far be it for
me to deny anyone

18:09.566 --> 18:11.699
a trip to the Aloha State.

18:11.742 --> 18:13.875
Give our regards
to Diamond Head.

18:13.918 --> 18:15.877
Will do.

18:17.183 --> 18:19.272
Can't believe Torres gets to hit

18:19.315 --> 18:20.664
the beach in Hawai'i
before I do.

18:20.708 --> 18:22.101
Mm, I'm not so sure the beach

18:22.144 --> 18:23.798
offers enough
adrenaline for him.

18:23.841 --> 18:26.366
My guess is Nick's probably
climbing the side of a volcano.

18:26.409 --> 18:27.715
If that volcano
is near a bakery,

18:27.758 --> 18:29.760
he can bring back
some malasadas.

18:29.804 --> 18:31.153
Ooh, is that like
a Hawaiian beignet?

18:31.197 --> 18:33.808
By way of Portugal.
Mmm, pure heaven.

18:33.851 --> 18:36.158
Plus, being down an agent
is pure something else.

18:36.202 --> 18:37.638
Come on, Knight, no sour grapes.

18:37.681 --> 18:39.335
You know it's nothing
we can't handle.

18:39.379 --> 18:41.468
Especially since you've got me.

18:41.511 --> 18:43.339
Hey. Fornell.

18:43.383 --> 18:44.601
Again.

18:44.645 --> 18:47.865
- Did you sleep here?
- Yeah, right? No.

18:47.909 --> 18:49.519
Torres called me
from the airport.

18:49.563 --> 18:53.219
Said that you guys would be
needing an extra hand.

18:53.262 --> 18:55.656
I guess that's what we get
for teasing him about Orlando.

18:56.657 --> 18:58.006
Look,

18:58.049 --> 19:00.051
I know I can't work
the case officially,

19:00.095 --> 19:01.618
but as Tommy's sponsor,

19:01.662 --> 19:04.317
I owe the guy a certain level
of involvement.

19:07.058 --> 19:09.017
Well, I do have a lot
of job sites to call.

19:09.060 --> 19:10.279
Miller had gigs

19:10.323 --> 19:12.194
from North Carolina
to South Jersey.

19:12.238 --> 19:13.456
And there is a grieving dad
who I'm sure

19:13.500 --> 19:15.241
could use someone to talk to.

19:15.284 --> 19:18.200
A grieving dad who's still
a suspect, so he's off-limits.

19:18.244 --> 19:20.724
For you, not for me.
If he killed Tommy,

19:20.768 --> 19:22.291
I'd have his confession
right away.

19:22.335 --> 19:24.337
PARKER:Listen, Tobias, I,
uh, I appreciate

19:24.380 --> 19:25.903
what you're trying
This is weird.

19:25.947 --> 19:27.296
Someone just filed
a missing persons report

19:27.340 --> 19:30.299
with Baltimore PD
for a Thomas A. Miller.

19:30.343 --> 19:31.996
Our guy is Thomas P. Miller.

19:32.040 --> 19:33.607
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Two missing Thomas Millers

19:33.650 --> 19:34.825
50 miles apart?

19:34.869 --> 19:36.610
I guess "weird" is the word.

19:36.653 --> 19:38.960
Or one hell of a coincidence.
No such thing,

19:39.003 --> 19:40.309
as Gibbs would say.

19:40.353 --> 19:41.615
Well, then again,
maybe it was some kind

19:41.658 --> 19:44.835
of a Terminator copycat.

19:44.879 --> 19:46.533
Cyborg assassin. Keep talking.

19:46.576 --> 19:48.665
You remember, three other
Sarah Connors were killed

19:48.709 --> 19:50.667
before Arnold
found Linda Hamilton.

19:50.711 --> 19:52.626
You mean, someone's out
there killing people

19:52.669 --> 19:54.628
who are named
Thomas Miller?

19:54.671 --> 19:56.760
Well, there's only one
way to find out. McGee?

19:56.804 --> 19:58.980
Uh, I'd love to, but my guy
at the State Department

19:59.023 --> 20:01.374
has a lead on our scammers,
so I'm gonna...

20:01.417 --> 20:03.027
- Then it's you and me, Knight.
- And me.

20:04.333 --> 20:06.901
All right. Fine.

20:06.944 --> 20:10.600
I get it. I'll just go
and check on Jimmy again.

20:10.644 --> 20:12.211
You're okay?

20:13.255 --> 20:15.170
I'm great.

20:15.214 --> 20:16.911
And I understand.

20:16.954 --> 20:20.175
So, go get your Terminator.

20:21.872 --> 20:23.134
Hey, Tobias?

20:24.571 --> 20:26.181
You want to say it?

20:29.793 --> 20:31.665
We'll be back.

20:42.632 --> 20:44.678
I hate seeing Fornell so adrift.

20:44.721 --> 20:46.549
Just like I hate telling him no.

20:46.593 --> 20:47.985
In our group, he's Papa Bear.

20:48.029 --> 20:49.900
Taking care
of all the other cubs.

20:49.944 --> 20:51.728
Uh, he had the same
rep at the Bureau.

20:51.772 --> 20:54.557
bender of rules, but he'd give
you the shirt off his back.

20:54.601 --> 20:56.037
Tommy's death
had to renew emotions

20:56.080 --> 20:58.561
about his daughter, his wife.

20:58.605 --> 21:01.695
Talk about cumulative grief.

21:01.738 --> 21:04.001
No kidding.
One loss on top of another.

21:04.045 --> 21:05.002
You've heard of it?

21:05.046 --> 21:07.135
We've all had our share.

21:07.178 --> 21:08.832
Have you?

21:08.876 --> 21:10.356
Well, if you ever
want to talk...

21:10.399 --> 21:12.401
Uh, what-- Are you sure
that it's Dr. Grace

21:12.445 --> 21:14.055
who leads this group of yours?

21:15.448 --> 21:16.840
Have you booked your eval yet?

21:16.884 --> 21:18.320
I'm getting to it.

21:18.364 --> 21:21.192
Mm-hmm.
Sounds a little like avoidance.

21:21.236 --> 21:23.194
Saved by the doorbell.

21:23.238 --> 21:25.632
Make that "definite avoidance."

21:27.808 --> 21:29.897
Nina Miller? NCIS.

21:29.940 --> 21:31.290
Did you find my husband?

21:31.333 --> 21:32.726
We are investigating
a Thomas Miller

21:32.769 --> 21:35.381
- who is missing.
- Can we come in?

21:35.424 --> 21:36.599
Thank you.

21:37.557 --> 21:39.254
Hey.

21:42.170 --> 21:44.041
Took forever to get
the baby down,

21:44.085 --> 21:46.653
so if you don't mind...?Ah.

21:46.696 --> 21:48.437
When did you last see
your husband?

21:48.481 --> 21:49.960
Yesterday morning.

21:50.004 --> 21:51.745
Tommy calls me a worrywart
since the baby,

21:51.788 --> 21:53.660
but he's away so much,
I can't help it.

21:53.703 --> 21:55.096
And why is he away so much?

21:55.139 --> 21:56.924
He's got job sites
all over the place.

21:56.967 --> 21:59.274
I've been calling nonstop,
but he hasn't called back.

21:59.318 --> 22:01.494
Whoa.

22:01.537 --> 22:02.625
Are you okay?

22:02.669 --> 22:04.975
Yeah. No, I'm fine.

22:05.019 --> 22:06.803
Um, Mrs. Miller, could
I trouble you for some water?

22:06.847 --> 22:08.065
Sure.

22:13.375 --> 22:14.985
Whoa.

22:15.029 --> 22:19.729
Apparently, our Tommy
and her Tommy is the same Tommy.

22:20.774 --> 22:22.428
Double life, double wife.

22:31.654 --> 22:34.091
I just can't believe he's dead.

22:36.050 --> 22:37.747
When did you
and your husband meet?

22:37.791 --> 22:40.315
Just over a year ago.

22:40.359 --> 22:43.100
Tommy was working
a plumbing job at my office.

22:43.144 --> 22:46.539
I was working late,
he was so sweet.

22:46.582 --> 22:49.411
We struck up a conversation
that never ended.

22:49.455 --> 22:50.760
And the baby?

22:50.804 --> 22:52.327
When we found out
I was pregnant,

22:52.371 --> 22:53.981
Tommy proposed on the spot.

22:54.024 --> 22:55.852
We got married at city hall
and the baby was born

22:55.896 --> 22:57.463
six months later.

22:57.506 --> 23:00.030
Did Tommy ever talk about
his time in the military?

23:00.074 --> 23:02.555
Not much. I knew he'd served,

23:02.598 --> 23:05.775
but he'd change the subject
whenever I brought it up.

23:05.819 --> 23:07.429
And you didn't find that odd?

23:07.473 --> 23:09.344
Why would I? Whatever
he went through over there

23:09.388 --> 23:11.781
he had no interest in reliving.

23:11.825 --> 23:15.394
Tommy was focused
on the future. With us.

23:15.437 --> 23:17.004
Even though he was away
so often?

23:17.047 --> 23:18.745
What are you trying to say?

23:18.788 --> 23:20.311
I'm just wondering
if maybe it ever led

23:20.355 --> 23:22.444
to any fights or arguments.

23:22.488 --> 23:23.793
Never.

23:23.837 --> 23:25.055
If anything,
it made his coming home

23:25.099 --> 23:26.535
that much more special.

23:26.579 --> 23:29.408
So no strange behavior at all?

23:29.451 --> 23:31.584
I didn't say that.

23:31.627 --> 23:34.500
He could be moody sometimes,
but who isn't?

23:34.543 --> 23:37.372
His sweetness outweighed the...

23:37.416 --> 23:39.983
- What?
- Something did happen yesterday.

23:40.027 --> 23:42.290
Outside the café
after breakfast,

23:42.333 --> 23:44.597
Tommy was walking the baby
and me to my car,

23:44.640 --> 23:47.469
gave me a hug and then,
suddenly, turned on his heels

23:47.513 --> 23:48.949
and drove off in his truck.

23:48.992 --> 23:50.603
Without saying a word?

23:50.646 --> 23:52.256
Said something about
being late to a job,

23:52.300 --> 23:54.215
but the look on his face,

23:54.258 --> 23:56.609
it was like he'd seen
a ghost or something.

23:56.652 --> 23:58.480
We'll need the name
of that café.

23:58.524 --> 24:00.047
Did you talk to Tommy
after that?

24:00.090 --> 24:03.572
I called a bunch of times,
like I said, but...

24:03.616 --> 24:05.618
that was the last time
I saw him.

24:05.661 --> 24:07.750
The last time the baby and I...

24:09.709 --> 24:11.624
What are we gonna do?

24:11.667 --> 24:14.496
How could things
possibly get worse?

24:17.630 --> 24:22.461
Actually, I'm afraid
that there is one more thing

24:22.504 --> 24:24.245
that we need to tell you.

24:25.812 --> 24:28.641
Okay, hold still.

24:28.684 --> 24:30.033
So she took it well?

24:30.077 --> 24:31.557
About as well
as you'd expect bigamy

24:31.600 --> 24:33.080
to go over.

24:33.123 --> 24:34.516
I've been treating
quite a few head wounds

24:34.560 --> 24:36.126
down here over the
last couple months.

24:36.170 --> 24:38.128
This is the first one
caused by a family photo.

24:38.172 --> 24:41.305
In a very heavy frame,
thrown hard and fast.

24:41.349 --> 24:42.785
Violent reaction

24:42.829 --> 24:45.266
to marital betrayal,
pretty textbook stuff.

24:45.309 --> 24:47.964
Aka shooting the messenger.

24:48.008 --> 24:49.966
She accused us
of fabricating the whole story

24:50.010 --> 24:52.708
to bait her into some kind
of false murder confession.

24:52.752 --> 24:54.014
And when she realized
that you weren't lying

24:54.057 --> 24:55.276
about Tommy's other wife?

24:55.319 --> 24:57.408
Glad she wasn't
holding a hammer.

24:57.452 --> 24:58.714
Yeah, I can't imagine

24:58.758 --> 25:00.455
how someone could
juggle two spouses.

25:00.499 --> 25:02.239
Starts with two cell phones.

25:02.283 --> 25:04.894
Knight found a burner in a panel
under Tommy's driver's seat.

25:04.938 --> 25:06.461
She's running it down
to Kasie now.

25:06.505 --> 25:07.810
FORNELL:How could I
have missed it?

25:07.854 --> 25:09.682
Tommy and I had coffee

25:09.725 --> 25:13.076
a bunch of times,
and some great conversations,

25:13.120 --> 25:15.818
and not once
would I have guessed...

25:15.862 --> 25:18.342
He managed to deceive two women,
but you think you're special?

25:19.387 --> 25:21.563
Well, I was a federal agent.

25:22.608 --> 25:23.957
And a damn good one.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.436
Tommy was just a two-timer.

25:25.480 --> 25:26.829
Perhaps.

25:26.873 --> 25:29.571
But everything about him
was rooted in trauma.

25:29.615 --> 25:31.878
Tommy's second life likely
provided an escape

25:31.921 --> 25:34.315
from the burden
of Sally's death.

25:34.358 --> 25:35.838
Without his first wife
ever finding out?

25:35.882 --> 25:37.536
That's what I wondered.
Us, too.

25:37.579 --> 25:41.061
But before I end up a human
punching bag twice in one day,

25:41.104 --> 25:44.194
we're waiting to check the
security footage from the café.

25:46.153 --> 25:48.677
Unless you would like
to tell the first wife.

25:50.113 --> 25:51.245
You've been offering to help.

25:52.333 --> 25:55.162
Yeah. That offer just expired.

26:00.254 --> 26:02.778
PIPER:This game is so
cringe, it's good.

26:02.822 --> 26:04.954
Yeah, that's why
we love it.

26:04.998 --> 26:07.391
Hey. Hope I'm not interrupting.

26:07.435 --> 26:10.743
Oh, Jess, uh, hang
on. Uh, pause.

26:10.786 --> 26:12.005
No cheating while I'm gone.

26:14.703 --> 26:16.009
All right, you're
going down,

26:16.052 --> 26:18.098
Fintress, you're going down.

26:18.141 --> 26:20.143
Just, uh, just killing time,

26:20.187 --> 26:23.538
waiting on DNA from the pipes
and the plumbing tools.

26:23.582 --> 26:25.714
Yeah, speaking of pipes,

26:25.758 --> 26:27.150
killing time with Piper?

26:27.194 --> 26:30.066
Hey, hey. Chill.

26:31.198 --> 26:33.417
It's early.
Mm-hmm.

26:33.461 --> 26:36.159
Man, I can barely juggle
one person, but two?

26:36.203 --> 26:38.379
How's that even possible?

26:38.422 --> 26:41.077
It's not, apparently.
Here's the burner

26:41.121 --> 26:43.689
with any and all deep, dark
secrets that you might find.

26:43.732 --> 26:45.255
Hmm, like a third wife?

26:45.299 --> 26:47.649
- Wouldn't that be fun?
- My sister used to say

26:47.693 --> 26:49.085
if you juggle
too many relationships,

26:49.129 --> 26:51.131
you end up
with no relationships.

26:51.174 --> 26:52.523
Or in this case,
you end up dead.

26:52.567 --> 26:55.657
Speaking of which,
is Parker okay?

26:57.006 --> 26:58.355
Okay, you should've
seen his face

26:58.399 --> 27:00.009
when she threw
that frame at him.

27:03.447 --> 27:05.058
Oh.
Oh, busted.

27:05.101 --> 27:06.929
Yeah, his ears must be burning.

27:06.973 --> 27:08.061
Got to go.
Mm-hmm.

27:08.104 --> 27:09.323
Okay. Hey, I will work on this,

27:09.366 --> 27:10.672
but this isn't over yet.

27:10.716 --> 27:12.021
I want to hear
all the exciting details.

27:12.065 --> 27:13.632
I'm out of rainbow grenades.

27:14.850 --> 27:16.069
So do I.

27:20.203 --> 27:22.379
Kasie is working on the phone.

27:22.423 --> 27:24.686
- Among other things.
- McSorry I missed

27:24.730 --> 27:27.123
the fireworks,
but I must say, it was worth it.

27:27.167 --> 27:28.342
Good time
at the State Department?

27:28.385 --> 27:29.952
Eh, a good start.
Using the SIM card

27:29.996 --> 27:32.302
I copied off of Jordan's
cell phone, we were able

27:32.346 --> 27:35.088
to triangulate the scammers'
location to South Sudan.

27:35.131 --> 27:38.744
And there is a special ops unit
being deployed as we speak.

27:38.787 --> 27:40.702
- Well, that's amazing.
- Amazing as it is,

27:40.746 --> 27:42.356
I want to hear all about
this second wife still.

27:42.399 --> 27:46.708
Yes, Parker could have used
his own special ops unit.

27:46.752 --> 27:48.971
You won't have to hear about
the second wife, McGee,

27:49.015 --> 27:50.669
you're about to see her.
You got the café video?

27:50.712 --> 27:52.235
Yeah, the parking lot.

27:52.279 --> 27:53.715
This is right
after breakfast, so...

27:54.977 --> 27:56.718
There they are.

27:56.762 --> 27:58.633
The happy couple.

27:58.677 --> 28:00.635
Mc
You know, it's one thing
to read it in the tabloids,

28:00.679 --> 28:02.158
another to see it up close.

28:02.202 --> 28:04.421
A lot less fun than you'd think.

28:04.465 --> 28:06.249
Well, there's the hug-and-run,
like Nina said.

28:06.293 --> 28:07.642
And Tommy's clearly
spooked by something,

28:07.686 --> 28:08.861
but what exactly?

28:08.904 --> 28:10.819
Or who?

28:10.863 --> 28:13.082
Wait, stop it there?

28:14.780 --> 28:16.695
- You see our ghost?
- I think that may be Jordan.

28:16.738 --> 28:19.262
Our grieving dad.
Can you punch in right there?

28:19.306 --> 28:21.787
Are you sure?

28:21.830 --> 28:23.876
Mc
What's he doing there?

28:25.442 --> 28:27.575
McYou lied
to us, Big Rick.

28:27.618 --> 28:30.796
No, I didn't.
You're the one that lied to me.

28:30.839 --> 28:33.189
You told me that you had
a lead on my scammers

28:33.233 --> 28:34.582
just to get me down here,

28:34.625 --> 28:36.366
and now I'm getting
this questions?

28:36.410 --> 28:38.194
Is this you, Mr. Jordan?

28:38.238 --> 28:40.283
I don't know, is it?

28:40.327 --> 28:41.763
Don't play cute, okay?
I'm not in the mood.

28:41.807 --> 28:43.373
Oh, I'm not in the mood, either.
Why the hell

28:43.417 --> 28:45.811
- are you tracking me?
- Tough old bird.

28:45.854 --> 28:49.336
No, he's just sad.

28:49.379 --> 28:50.990
Where did you get
these pictures anyway?

28:51.033 --> 28:52.121
From a café

28:52.165 --> 28:53.862
parking lot in Pikesville.

28:53.906 --> 28:55.777
You were a long way from home.

28:55.821 --> 28:58.562
Which is something you neglected
to tell Agent Torres or myself.

28:58.606 --> 28:59.868
So I was there. So?

28:59.912 --> 29:01.522
So do we charge with stalking

29:01.565 --> 29:02.915
or do we charge you with murder?

29:02.958 --> 29:05.178
Look, I saw his
truck drive by.

29:05.221 --> 29:07.746
He hadn't been answering
any of my phone calls,

29:07.789 --> 29:09.443
so yeah, I followed him.

29:09.486 --> 29:11.488
But I certainly didn't kill him.

29:11.532 --> 29:12.794
That video basically shows
Commander Miller

29:12.838 --> 29:14.404
running away from you.

29:14.448 --> 29:16.885
Not me. He didn't even see me.

29:16.929 --> 29:18.452
I was waiting
for his lady friend

29:18.495 --> 29:20.106
to leave to go up
and talk to him.

29:20.149 --> 29:21.803
But I didn't have a chance to
because he hightailed it

29:21.847 --> 29:23.109
the hell out of there.

29:23.152 --> 29:24.675
I didn't get to say
a word to him.

29:24.719 --> 29:25.981
- Then who was he running from?
- I don't know.

29:26.025 --> 29:28.157
Some guy in a silver SUV.

29:29.115 --> 29:30.464
Ah.

29:30.507 --> 29:31.900
No pictures of that, huh?

29:31.944 --> 29:33.684
It pulled into
the parking lot

29:33.728 --> 29:35.817
and Tommy stopped dead
in his tracks.

29:35.861 --> 29:37.688
Then he hopped
in his truck

29:37.732 --> 29:39.560
and he hightailed it
the hell out of there.

29:39.603 --> 29:41.649
And this silver SUV?Well, it followed him.

29:41.692 --> 29:43.259
I didn't think anything of it,

29:43.303 --> 29:45.348
or else I'd have
mentioned it to you.

29:45.392 --> 29:46.741
But now,

29:46.785 --> 29:48.699
you got to work to do.

29:51.137 --> 29:54.183
But now that we're accusing him,
he points to some silver SUV.

29:54.227 --> 29:55.968
Is that vague enough for you?

29:56.011 --> 29:57.796
I believe him.

29:59.101 --> 30:00.886
All due respect, Tobias,

30:00.929 --> 30:05.194
I appreciate your soft spot
for this guy, but obviously...

30:05.238 --> 30:07.849
Crime scene DNA came back.
He's not our guy.

30:09.677 --> 30:11.157
Obviously,
your instincts are good.

30:11.200 --> 30:13.594
Do we know who <i>is</i> our guy?

30:13.637 --> 30:15.030
Got a pretty good idea.

30:23.517 --> 30:24.866
If I'm your best suspect,

30:24.910 --> 30:26.737
you guys got a lot
more work to do.

30:26.781 --> 30:28.435
One careless move, Marty.

30:28.478 --> 30:30.002
That's all it takes
to get caught.

30:30.045 --> 30:32.178
And how was I careless?

30:32.221 --> 30:33.788
Actually, you were
careless twice.

30:33.832 --> 30:36.573
Once with the silver SUV.

30:36.617 --> 30:39.011
See, the DMV confirmed
that you drive that.

30:39.054 --> 30:40.621
Look, I see a silver SUV.

30:40.664 --> 30:42.841
I-I can't say that it's mine.

30:42.884 --> 30:44.538
Uh, a lot of people
drive them, so...

30:44.581 --> 30:47.280
All the way to a Pikesville
café where Tommy

30:47.323 --> 30:49.499
was having breakfast the morning
before he was killed?

30:49.543 --> 30:52.938
Like I told the other agent,
I was at work.

30:52.981 --> 30:54.896
- You can call my boss.
- McWe did.

30:54.940 --> 30:56.158
Yeah, he covered for you.

30:56.202 --> 30:58.378
Except, uh,
we checked your time card.

30:58.421 --> 31:00.075
You didn't clock in
until after lunch.

31:02.730 --> 31:05.037
It was a fluke, okay?

31:05.080 --> 31:06.865
If I hadn't have stopped for gas
across the street,

31:06.908 --> 31:08.170
I would've never
even seen Tommy.

31:08.214 --> 31:09.519
Mc
But you did see him.

31:09.563 --> 31:12.131
With another woman
and their baby.

31:15.961 --> 31:17.310
Yeah, you know,
I couldn't believe it.

31:17.353 --> 31:19.921
Just-just walking
in broad daylight with...

31:19.965 --> 31:21.923
- And Tommy saw you?
- Almost right away.

31:21.967 --> 31:24.317
He looked right at me
and then drove off fast.

31:24.360 --> 31:27.146
At which point you followed him
to his construction site

31:27.189 --> 31:29.409
to make him pay
for betraying your sister.

31:29.452 --> 31:30.932
No.

31:30.976 --> 31:32.368
I mean, yeah.

31:32.412 --> 31:34.936
I-I... I followed
him, but I-I...

31:34.980 --> 31:37.025
I got him to pull over and then,

31:37.069 --> 31:38.592
you know, he just
gave it up right away.

31:38.635 --> 31:39.898
It was a full mea culpa.

31:39.941 --> 31:41.421
About how he, like,
fell for this chick,

31:41.464 --> 31:43.031
got her knocked her up,
you know?

31:43.075 --> 31:44.772
And I wanted

31:44.815 --> 31:45.947
to kill him, I did.

31:45.991 --> 31:48.080
Yeah, but, you
know, he swore

31:48.123 --> 31:49.951
that he was gonna come clean
and he begged me

31:49.995 --> 31:52.171
to let him be the one
to tell Olive.

31:52.214 --> 31:53.955
That's a big secret to keep.

31:53.999 --> 31:56.610
I mean, think I wanted to break
my baby sister's heart?

31:56.653 --> 31:57.828
But you told her anyways?

31:57.872 --> 31:59.918
No, I never said a word.

32:02.529 --> 32:07.360
Well, if Olive didn't know,
then you are our only suspect.

32:07.403 --> 32:08.927
All because of my car?

32:08.970 --> 32:11.277
Earlier we said
you were careless twice.

32:11.320 --> 32:12.931
First with the SUV...

32:12.974 --> 32:14.933
And second with your DNA,

32:14.976 --> 32:17.239
which we found
on a plumbing pipe that was used

32:17.283 --> 32:18.588
to kill Tommy.

32:21.026 --> 32:22.244
Uh...

32:24.464 --> 32:25.856
I-I'd like to...

32:25.900 --> 32:28.598
I'd like to talk to a lawyer.

32:28.642 --> 32:32.124
Well, I'd say he's your man, but
he's clearly hiding something.

32:32.167 --> 32:35.475
Not hiding. Protecting.

32:36.955 --> 32:38.608
<i>Thanks for coming back,</i> <i>
Mrs. Miller.</i>

32:38.652 --> 32:40.523
I'm Special Agent Parker.

32:40.567 --> 32:42.003
Did you find who killed Tommy?

32:42.047 --> 32:43.613
Uh, we have a
suspect in custody.

32:43.657 --> 32:47.095
Um, have you met
Dr. Grace Confalone?

32:47.139 --> 32:49.184
I'm so sorry
for your loss, Olive.

32:49.228 --> 32:50.577
May I call you Olive?

32:50.620 --> 32:52.492
Dr. Grace. Hmm.

32:52.535 --> 32:56.017
Tommy always spoke about
how helpful your sessions were.

32:56.061 --> 32:58.019
He sang your praises as well.

32:58.063 --> 33:00.456
I only wish
I could have done more.

33:00.500 --> 33:01.501
You and me both.

33:01.544 --> 33:02.893
Uh, in fairness, I don't see how

33:02.937 --> 33:04.330
either of you
could have helped him

33:04.373 --> 33:05.809
if you didn't know about
his other family.

33:05.853 --> 33:07.115
I was stunned.

33:07.159 --> 33:09.900
He hid it so well
from all of us.

33:09.944 --> 33:11.815
What are you talking about?

33:11.859 --> 33:13.513
What other family?

33:13.556 --> 33:15.906
Your brother really
didn't tell you?

33:15.950 --> 33:18.170
There's no easy way
to say this, Olive.

33:18.213 --> 33:19.432
As I now know

33:19.475 --> 33:20.999
from experience.

33:26.613 --> 33:29.050
Her name is Nina.

33:29.094 --> 33:32.053
The baby is four months
old, and obviously,

33:32.097 --> 33:34.142
that's Tommy.

33:34.186 --> 33:35.491
What is this?

33:35.535 --> 33:38.364
Some sick kind of photoshop?

33:38.407 --> 33:41.889
'Cause Tommy
would never, ever...

33:43.847 --> 33:45.632
And what does Marty
have to do with this?

33:45.675 --> 33:50.158
Well, this is not easy
to say, either, um...

33:50.202 --> 33:52.769
Your brother's downstairs
being charged with murder.

33:52.813 --> 33:57.600
Apparently, he stumbled
onto Tommy's second family

33:57.644 --> 34:01.822
in Baltimore and took matters
into his own hands.

34:01.865 --> 34:04.825
No. This is a mistake.

34:04.868 --> 34:06.609
Uh, afraid not.

34:06.653 --> 34:10.091
A pipe at the crime scene
had DNA that matched Marty's.

34:10.135 --> 34:11.353
A partial match, at least.

34:11.397 --> 34:13.660
The 23 chromosome was corrupted,

34:13.703 --> 34:16.532
so it could also be a sibling.

34:16.576 --> 34:17.838
Like you.

34:18.969 --> 34:21.102
But Marty says he never
told you anything,

34:21.146 --> 34:22.886
so you're in the clear.

34:22.930 --> 34:24.801
PARKER:Unless there's
something that you know

34:24.845 --> 34:26.586
that we don't.

34:27.804 --> 34:30.677
Marty didn't tell me.

34:30.720 --> 34:32.592
He didn't have to.

34:35.377 --> 34:37.945
And he didn't kill Tommy.

34:37.988 --> 34:39.555
Oh...

34:39.599 --> 34:41.470
That's so much loss, Olive.

34:41.514 --> 34:43.994
It's too much.

34:44.038 --> 34:45.996
Just tell us what happened.

34:47.302 --> 34:49.565
Marty stopped by the market...

34:51.524 --> 34:53.308
...on his way to work.

34:53.352 --> 34:57.443
I could tell something was up,
just by looking at his face.

34:57.486 --> 34:59.445
He's never been a good liar.

34:59.488 --> 35:00.794
He's doing
a pretty convincing job

35:00.837 --> 35:02.752
not throwing you under the bus.

35:04.580 --> 35:07.496
All he said was...

35:07.540 --> 35:09.672
"Go see your husband
and talk to him."

35:09.716 --> 35:13.328
So I took my break
and I went to the job site.

35:13.372 --> 35:15.765
And one look at me,

35:15.809 --> 35:18.333
and it all came spilling out.

35:20.292 --> 35:22.424
All Tommy's guilt,

35:22.468 --> 35:24.165
all his regret.

35:24.209 --> 35:27.255
Like he seemed...

35:27.299 --> 35:29.953
almost relieved.

35:29.997 --> 35:31.912
Relieved of the secret.

35:31.955 --> 35:35.959
He tried to explain to me
how it happened,

35:36.003 --> 35:38.179
begged me to forgive him.

35:38.223 --> 35:40.529
- And I almost did.
- Almost.

35:40.573 --> 35:43.228
Until he was too honest.

35:43.271 --> 35:45.055
He tells me

35:45.099 --> 35:47.623
how she set him free.

35:50.670 --> 35:53.063
How Nina...

35:55.892 --> 35:58.982
...she made him forget
everything that had happened,

35:59.026 --> 36:00.593
and who he'd been.

36:00.636 --> 36:01.942
He'd been your husband.

36:01.985 --> 36:03.465
And I'd waited years.

36:05.424 --> 36:07.687
To have a family of my own.

36:11.256 --> 36:12.822
And he just kept talking.

36:12.866 --> 36:15.608
He even tried
to hold me. I just...

36:15.651 --> 36:18.741
but I grabbed the pipe
and I swung.

36:18.785 --> 36:20.961
And Tommy,

36:21.004 --> 36:23.442
he stumbled over the edge. I...

36:27.881 --> 36:29.883
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

36:29.926 --> 36:31.189
I'm sorry.

36:32.146 --> 36:34.017
I'm so sorry.

36:34.061 --> 36:35.584
A sad ending

36:35.628 --> 36:37.891
to one surreal case.

36:37.934 --> 36:39.545
Had Tommy been honest
with both women,

36:39.588 --> 36:40.894
he'd still be alive.
I don't know.

36:40.937 --> 36:43.157
Honesty about
something like that

36:43.201 --> 36:44.767
would not go down
much better with me.

36:44.811 --> 36:46.987
Which I imagine is why
he got comfortable

36:47.030 --> 36:49.511
avoiding the issue
rather than facing it.

36:49.555 --> 36:51.948
Like you avoiding
that psych eval?

36:51.992 --> 36:53.863
Nice segue.

36:53.907 --> 36:55.517
Well, you teed it up,
I had to hit it.

36:55.561 --> 36:57.040
I'm not avoiding anything.

36:57.084 --> 36:59.217
We've just all been
a little preoccupied.

36:59.260 --> 37:01.306
Well, then, let's get something
in the books, shall we?

37:03.264 --> 37:04.613
Fine.

37:04.657 --> 37:05.788
What do you got?

37:05.832 --> 37:07.094
- Tomorrow, 2:00?
- Done.

37:07.137 --> 37:08.182
It's a date.

37:10.315 --> 37:11.838
No, it's an appointment.

37:11.881 --> 37:13.927
That's what I meant.

37:13.970 --> 37:16.582
Right. Of course.

37:16.625 --> 37:18.236
Okay, I'll see--
I'll see you then.

37:21.587 --> 37:23.676
McGEE:You guys are not gonna
believe this one.

37:23.719 --> 37:26.679
After today, I think I'm
gonna believe anything.

37:26.722 --> 37:28.420
So that special ops team, right?

37:28.463 --> 37:31.684
They found our scammers exactly
where we said they'd be.

37:31.727 --> 37:33.947
Right? Took down
the whole operation.

37:33.990 --> 37:36.254
- Some much-needed good news.
- Yeah, it gets better, though.

37:36.297 --> 37:39.126
Turns out, these guys weren't
just scamming military families.

37:39.169 --> 37:41.084
They were traffickers,
moving all kinds of stuff.

37:41.128 --> 37:43.130
Until they texted
one grieving father,

37:43.173 --> 37:44.958
and then you took
care of the rest.

37:45.001 --> 37:46.742
Well, not just me.

37:46.786 --> 37:48.309
Credit where it's due, McGee.

37:48.353 --> 37:50.180
Oh, that's Fornell.

37:50.224 --> 37:51.530
I told him to meet me
at Jordan's place

37:51.573 --> 37:52.879
to give him the good news.

37:52.922 --> 37:54.620
Figured he could use it.

37:54.663 --> 37:55.882
KNIGHT:Yeah, well, I would
love to join you,

37:55.925 --> 37:58.188
but once again, paperwork.

37:58.232 --> 37:59.755
TBS reports and all.

37:59.799 --> 38:02.062
Hey, uh, give Jordan our best.

38:02.105 --> 38:04.325
Oh.
And seriously, Tim?

38:04.369 --> 38:05.370
Way to go.

38:07.763 --> 38:09.548
And thank <i>you</i>

38:09.591 --> 38:11.289
for reminding Grace.

38:11.332 --> 38:12.725
Happy to help.

38:29.132 --> 38:30.308
So that's it?

38:30.351 --> 38:32.310
These scammers, you got 'em.

38:32.353 --> 38:34.747
McWe got them.
We all got them.

38:34.790 --> 38:36.183
You know, Big Rick,
if it wasn't for you

38:36.226 --> 38:37.793
pointing us
in the right direction,

38:37.837 --> 38:39.708
there would still be
a lot more creeps out there

38:39.752 --> 38:41.841
hurting people that
we don't even know about.

38:41.884 --> 38:44.322
Not a bad silver lining.

38:44.365 --> 38:45.671
Mm-hmm.

38:45.714 --> 38:47.281
What about Miller?

38:47.325 --> 38:49.022
Did you get the guys
- that killed him?
- Yeah.

38:49.065 --> 38:52.330
We're, uh, not at liberty
to discuss that yet, but, um,

38:52.373 --> 38:53.722
we're just glad it's not you.

38:53.766 --> 38:54.941
Yeah.

38:54.984 --> 38:56.334
So, no hard feelings?

38:56.377 --> 38:58.205
No.

39:01.513 --> 39:03.036
Mc
You okay?

39:05.604 --> 39:07.083
I'm okay enough.

39:07.127 --> 39:08.563
Why?

39:08.607 --> 39:10.478
Well, I just...

39:10.522 --> 39:12.306
thought you'd maybe be happier.

39:13.786 --> 39:16.571
Yeah, I thought I would,
too, but I...

39:17.616 --> 39:19.095
You still had hope.

39:21.446 --> 39:23.361
That we were wrong,
they were right.

39:24.536 --> 39:25.711
And...

39:25.754 --> 39:27.408
your daughter was alive.

39:28.670 --> 39:30.716
You get a text like that, you...

39:32.674 --> 39:35.068
...you can't help but think
that maybe they made a mistake.

39:35.111 --> 39:37.418
Maybe they sent the wrong ashes.

39:37.462 --> 39:40.943
That she's still out there
by herself, my little girl.

39:42.162 --> 39:44.425
It's like losing her
all over again.

39:50.126 --> 39:51.780
Welcome to the club...

39:53.608 --> 39:56.002
...that no one wants to join.

39:57.699 --> 39:59.527
What did...

39:59.571 --> 40:01.311
You lost a daughter?

40:01.355 --> 40:02.791
Emily.

40:02.835 --> 40:04.619
How?

40:05.664 --> 40:07.405
That's for another day.

40:10.843 --> 40:12.279
Tell me about Sally.

40:14.499 --> 40:15.848
Oh, Sally, she was...

40:15.891 --> 40:17.458
She was everything.

40:17.502 --> 40:19.939
She was-- she was a sailor,
she was a soccer player.

40:19.982 --> 40:22.637
She loved the ocean.

40:22.681 --> 40:24.117
She was quite
an artist, too.

40:24.160 --> 40:25.684
She was
my everything.

40:28.077 --> 40:30.428
I got a lot of questions <i>
for you, Jennings.</i>

40:30.471 --> 40:31.820
Nuh-uh. First you
can answer mine.

40:31.864 --> 40:33.256
How'd you find me?

40:33.300 --> 40:35.694
He didn't. I did.

40:35.737 --> 40:37.435
Yeah, that's true.
She's very good.

40:37.478 --> 40:39.132
You don't get it.

40:39.175 --> 40:40.960
If you guys found me,
that means they found me, too.

40:41.003 --> 40:42.570
Who is "they"?

40:42.614 --> 40:45.530
Who have you been running away
from all these years, huh?

40:45.573 --> 40:47.836
- Oh, you don't want to know.
- Oh, but I do want to know.

40:47.880 --> 40:49.142
Look, I did what
I had to, all right?

40:49.185 --> 40:50.360
To survive.

40:50.404 --> 40:52.058
Survive what?

40:53.668 --> 40:55.496
You'd better start answering
or I'm gonna rip...

40:55.540 --> 40:56.584
Patience, Torres.

40:56.628 --> 40:58.107
We'll get the story out of him

40:58.151 --> 40:59.282
- when we get to Pearl.
- You talk about patience?

40:59.326 --> 41:00.501
I've been waiting
five long years

41:00.545 --> 41:02.329
to find out
what really happened.

41:02.372 --> 41:04.549
All right, well, then, another
15 minutes won't kill you.

41:04.592 --> 41:05.854
No, but I could kill him.

41:05.898 --> 41:08.074
No, you won't. He won't.

41:08.117 --> 41:10.816
Look, technically, I found you,
so you're in my custody.

41:10.859 --> 41:12.165
What?

41:12.208 --> 41:13.732
Your custody?
What are you talking about?

41:13.775 --> 41:15.647
You wouldn't even be here
if I didn't invite you.

41:15.690 --> 41:18.214
You didn't invite me here, you
asked for my help on my island.

41:18.258 --> 41:19.477
And again, I came
to your rescue.

41:19.520 --> 41:21.000
Oh, okay,
all right.

41:21.043 --> 41:22.175
I see. See,
I thought we settled

41:22.218 --> 41:23.437
the score back in Orlando.

41:23.481 --> 41:25.178
Huh? Put the competition
behind us?

41:25.221 --> 41:27.310
There's no competition, okay?

41:27.354 --> 41:28.790
Since clearly I won years ago.

41:28.834 --> 41:30.749
Oh...
What are you guys doing?

41:30.792 --> 41:32.838
We're clarifying something,
all right?

41:32.881 --> 41:35.275
My friend here has decided
to rewrite history.

41:35.318 --> 41:37.146
I didn't rewrite history.
My friend here forgot

41:37.190 --> 41:38.713
that I speak truth to power.

41:38.757 --> 41:40.193
And the truth is
All right, look,

41:40.236 --> 41:41.150
I'll tell you everything
you want, all right?

41:48.810 --> 41:51.465
They're all around us.
