00:08.607 --> 00:11.608
This week on "VICE":
We see firsthand the results

00:11.693 --> 00:15.312
of Saudi Arabia's ongoing
air campaign in Yemen.

00:23.989 --> 00:26.623
Everything has been
hit and burnt,

00:26.709 --> 00:29.326
every single shop.

00:29.411 --> 00:33.497
And then, the ongoing battle
for LGBT rights in America.

00:33.582 --> 00:36.216
Can you understand how
a gay couple coming in here

00:36.335 --> 00:37.968
would feel
discriminated against?

00:38.053 --> 00:41.472
Americans have the right to
live according to their faith.

00:41.557 --> 00:44.975
This is our time
to take America back.

00:46.000 --> 00:52.074

01:07.082 --> 01:10.000
In season two, we profiled
the Houthi rebel group

01:10.085 --> 01:12.669
that now controls huge
parts of Yemen.

01:12.755 --> 01:14.421
<i>Today, Saudi Arabia,</i>

01:14.540 --> 01:17.541
<i>which is one of America's most
important allies in the region,</i>

01:17.676 --> 01:20.294
<i>is trying to eradicate
these rebel strongholds.</i>

01:20.379 --> 01:23.514
<i>But a report from the United Nations
that recently came to light</i>

01:23.599 --> 01:25.883
<i>accuses them
of targeting civilians</i>

01:25.968 --> 01:29.219
<i>in a "widespread
and systematic manner."</i>

01:29.355 --> 01:32.189
So we went back to Yemen
to see how Saudi Arabia's

01:32.274 --> 01:35.976
ongoing bombardment
is affecting the country.

01:43.619 --> 01:47.204
So we're just on the
roof of a building in the old town.

01:47.289 --> 01:50.908
Just going to see
what it's like to be

01:50.993 --> 01:54.244
in Sana'a for one night
of Saudi air strikes.

01:54.380 --> 01:56.880
It's been going on
for six months.

01:56.966 --> 01:59.499
Thirty thousand,
roughly, casualties so far,

01:59.585 --> 02:02.219
of those, 5,000 deaths.

02:02.304 --> 02:05.806
There's almost
always something in the air.

02:05.925 --> 02:08.140
But you just can't tell what.

02:08.259 --> 02:11.011
It's got anti-aircraft
gunfire going up here.

02:15.601 --> 02:18.235
Two air strikes so far.

02:18.320 --> 02:19.519
Here comes another one.

02:21.106 --> 02:22.656
And you can just imagine
having a family here,

02:22.775 --> 02:25.609
and having, you know, kids who have
to sit through this every night

02:25.744 --> 02:29.746
knowing that someone
or something is gonna get hit.

02:29.832 --> 02:32.082
And the strikes
we've seen tonight

02:32.167 --> 02:37.254
are close to one of the most
densely populated parts of Sana'a.

02:39.425 --> 02:43.176
<i>The next day we went to see houses
in the old city that had been hit.</i>

02:43.295 --> 02:45.295
So we've come to see
the site of a recent strike

02:45.431 --> 02:47.130
and as soon as we turned up,

02:47.266 --> 02:49.967
there's a fighter jet
above us somewhere,

02:50.052 --> 02:51.768
which has made everyone
very scared and nervous.

02:51.854 --> 02:53.520
Most people have
actually just left.

02:59.979 --> 03:02.145
<i>We met a man,
Mujahid al-Aini,</i>

03:02.281 --> 03:04.031
<i>whose brother Hafdullah,
was killed</i>

03:04.149 --> 03:07.284
<i>with his entire family
when his home was struck.</i>

03:18.664 --> 03:20.831
Describe what you saw
when you came here.

03:39.268 --> 03:41.151
<i>The conflict has forced</i>

03:41.236 --> 03:43.904
<i>over 2.5 million people
to flee their homes.</i>

03:44.023 --> 03:47.658
Some people have said that after
six months of this bombing

03:47.743 --> 03:52.529
parts of Yemen look like
Syria did after years.

03:52.665 --> 03:57.534
<i>We spoke to Ali Gael Mesar, who
showed us what was left of his house.</i>

03:57.670 --> 04:00.253
Do you know how many people were
killed in this area altogether?

04:08.681 --> 04:11.548
This is where you used
to sleep? This is your bed?

04:11.684 --> 04:14.134
Sleep. Yeah.

04:19.391 --> 04:22.442
How do you feel about
the planes flying every night?

04:31.203 --> 04:33.653
<i>Anyone unlucky
enough to live in the areas</i>

04:33.739 --> 04:37.074
<i>now under Houthi control
can become a target.</i>

04:37.209 --> 04:41.712
<i>The next day, we heard about air strikes
against a wedding party on the Red Sea coast.</i>

04:41.797 --> 04:44.381
We just turned up to a village where
there was an air strike yesterday,

04:44.466 --> 04:46.216
or three air strikes, we think.

04:46.301 --> 04:48.585
And there's a quite
low-flying jet above us.

04:48.721 --> 04:50.721
We've been here
five or six days,

04:50.806 --> 04:53.924
we've been used to jets
above us every day and night.

04:54.059 --> 04:57.511
But this is actually
pretty fucking terrifying.

04:57.596 --> 05:00.836
And they're scared as well, obviously,
because of what they experienced yesterday.

05:07.272 --> 05:09.322
Oh, yeah, and there's
a piece of skull

05:09.441 --> 05:12.242
with a lot of hair
still on it, burnt.

05:13.495 --> 05:15.445
The women came here
after the men were here?

05:20.285 --> 05:22.619
So the blast was
direct where people were?

05:27.292 --> 05:30.043
Another jet coming in.
Another one?

05:32.881 --> 05:34.514
This man wants to take us
to a house just here,

05:34.633 --> 05:37.884
and he says a large piece of shrapnel
came and killed a woman inside.

05:45.778 --> 05:47.418
He's saying
his mother was killed

05:47.479 --> 05:49.312
by a piece of flying shrapnel.

05:49.448 --> 05:53.150
A big piece of shrapnel came,
hit the wall here.

05:53.235 --> 05:57.154
And as he's telling that story,
there's another jet overhead.

06:11.670 --> 06:14.888
<i>For some, the bombs
reduced their family members</i>

06:15.007 --> 06:17.724
<i>to random pieces
of flesh and bone.</i>

06:32.024 --> 06:33.440
<i>To be fair,</i>

06:33.525 --> 06:35.358
<i>when the Houthis have been
trying to capture new ground,</i>

06:35.444 --> 06:38.495
<i>they too have shelled civilian
areas indiscriminately,</i>

06:38.580 --> 06:41.198
<i>and used land mines
when they retreated.</i>

06:41.283 --> 06:43.500
<i>They also use child soldiers.</i>

06:43.585 --> 06:46.536
<i>But so far, the vast
majority of casualties</i>

06:46.622 --> 06:50.257
<i>have been caused by the
Saudi-led bombing campaign.</i>

06:50.375 --> 06:53.460
<i>As we continued north,
the destruction got worse.</i>

06:53.545 --> 06:58.965
<i>It looked like anything that could make life
easier for civilians had been targeted.</i>

06:59.051 --> 07:00.767
We've seen one
blown up bridge already

07:00.886 --> 07:03.887
and the second bridge we've come
across has also been blown.

07:03.972 --> 07:09.059
We're told that every bridge has
been taken out by an air strike.

07:11.647 --> 07:14.064
So we're just outside Saada now

07:14.199 --> 07:16.449
and every single
gas station has been hit.

07:16.568 --> 07:18.902
And that doesn't only mean
that people can't get around

07:19.037 --> 07:20.737
and goods can't
get back and forth.

07:20.873 --> 07:22.322
But because
there's no electricity,

07:22.407 --> 07:24.407
it also means that people
can't power their homes

07:24.543 --> 07:26.710
because they rely on
generators for electricity.

07:26.795 --> 07:29.713
<i>As a result of this,
and an ongoing blockade,</i>

07:29.798 --> 07:33.383
<i>there are massive shortages
of food, water, and fuel.</i>

07:33.468 --> 07:36.419
<i>Parts of Yemen are now
on the brink of famine.</i>

07:36.505 --> 07:39.756
This is an IDP camp,
internally displaced persons,

07:39.892 --> 07:44.060
refugees from inside the country,
basically, who have fled from the north.

07:59.111 --> 08:01.745
<i>We visited one of the
few functioning hospitals,</i>

08:01.830 --> 08:03.446
<i>run by Doctors without Borders,</i>

08:03.532 --> 08:08.501
<i>who were barely able to cope with the
influx of starving and wounded civilians.</i>

08:18.797 --> 08:22.716
She actually came
with multiple shrapnel wounds,

08:22.801 --> 08:25.885
in the chest, abdomen,
and both legs and face,

08:25.971 --> 08:29.189
and gangrene of the distal
part of her right leg.

08:29.308 --> 08:32.442
And we did for her amputation.

08:32.527 --> 08:34.727
And were you there
when these missiles struck?

08:45.624 --> 08:48.074
So, they've fled their
homes because of the war

08:48.160 --> 08:51.745
and then in their IDP camps,
there's not enough water and food.

08:51.830 --> 08:53.997
Is there a breaking
point very nearby?

09:06.762 --> 09:09.896
<i>We continued our
journey into northwest Yemen,</i>

09:10.015 --> 09:11.564
<i>to the Houthi's heartland.</i>

09:11.683 --> 09:14.484
<i>Once we arrived in
the main city, Saada,</i>

09:14.569 --> 09:17.237
<i>we could see why so many
people had fled.</i>

09:22.194 --> 09:25.328
Everything has been
hit and burnt,

09:25.414 --> 09:27.831
every single shop.

09:29.167 --> 09:31.951
So this is another gas station
that was hit.

09:32.037 --> 09:35.538
There are ten
of these mini-buses

09:35.674 --> 09:38.091
that have been burnt to cinders.

09:38.210 --> 09:41.011
There are five cars and then
a truck and another vehicle

09:41.096 --> 09:44.047
on the other side of the road
that have been just destroyed.

09:44.132 --> 09:46.633
And you can imagine exactly
how this must have looked.

09:46.718 --> 09:49.519
You know, an everyday scene, something
that all of us do all the time.

09:49.604 --> 09:52.689
The guy here pulls up, the pump
would have been just here.

09:52.774 --> 09:56.109
People queuing,
and then suddenly, bang.

09:56.228 --> 10:00.397
The reason there was a queue for gas
was because of the Saudi blockade.

10:00.532 --> 10:02.532
So they caused there
to be a shortage of fuel,

10:02.617 --> 10:05.402
which causes the queues and
then they killed 21 civilians

10:05.487 --> 10:08.204
trying to get fuel for their
vehicles, for their homes,

10:08.290 --> 10:10.206
for their livings, to get food.

10:10.292 --> 10:13.410
It's... it's obscene.

10:20.585 --> 10:24.087
This was the post office.
Completely destroyed.

10:24.222 --> 10:26.306
The roof is pancaked.

10:26.425 --> 10:28.508
Oh, didn't even see this.

10:28.593 --> 10:31.761
Another huge crater here.

10:31.897 --> 10:38.435
These are big bombs. This is a
12-foot-deep, 25-, 30-foot-wide crater.

10:38.520 --> 10:41.938
It seems like almost every
single local government building

10:42.023 --> 10:47.327
has been directly hit,
if not very badly damaged.

10:48.663 --> 10:51.781
This is a part of
a 2,000-pound bomb,

10:51.867 --> 10:54.501
which makes perfect sense
when you see these craters

10:54.619 --> 11:00.590
and the unbelievable damage that's been done
to every single one of these buildings.

11:04.262 --> 11:06.713
This is the biggest crater
we've seen so far

11:06.798 --> 11:10.467
and right next to one of the
oldest mosques in the world.

11:10.552 --> 11:15.271
Someone just told us that this
has been open for 1,300 years,

11:15.357 --> 11:17.891
and this is the first time
in its history,

11:17.976 --> 11:20.360
it's had to close.

11:20.479 --> 11:24.647
<i>Throughout Saada, many homes
have also been destroyed.</i>

11:24.733 --> 11:27.951
<i>Abdullah al-Ibbi is one of
the only surviving members</i>

11:28.036 --> 11:30.320
<i>of the family who had
lived in this house.</i>

11:30.455 --> 11:34.657
Can you think of any reason why your family
and this house might have been struck?

11:44.219 --> 11:46.503
How many of your
family were killed?

11:50.976 --> 11:53.143
What's your life
like now, day-to-day?

11:59.734 --> 12:03.653
<i>In the once thriving
but now deserted marketplace,</i>

12:03.738 --> 12:08.158
<i>we found one man searching through the
rubble of his coffee and spice shop.</i>

12:13.331 --> 12:14.914
And who do you blame for this?

12:23.458 --> 12:27.544
<i>Schools, World Heritage
sites, aid organizations,</i>

12:27.679 --> 12:31.181
<i>and four Doctors without Borders
medical facilities have been struck.</i>

12:31.266 --> 12:34.050
<i>If that weren't bad enough,
the Saudis are also dropping</i>

12:34.186 --> 12:37.053
<i>bombs that most of the world
has said should be banned.</i>

12:37.138 --> 12:41.224
"Bomb frag, blue 97AB."

12:41.309 --> 12:43.560
So the yellow cylinder
would be underneath

12:43.645 --> 12:47.697
and this on top to act
as a kind of parachute...

12:49.484 --> 12:54.153
and then a shell opens, you know, 50, 100
feet above the ground, maybe higher,

12:54.239 --> 12:57.824
and then these disperse
over a wide area.

12:57.909 --> 13:04.080
And the idea is, they all
go off when they land.

13:04.216 --> 13:08.751
The problem is that...
they often don't.

13:08.887 --> 13:12.722
And you know, these are attractive
to kids, which is the problem.

13:12.807 --> 13:17.594
They pick them up and that's why kids get
killed years after conflicts have ended.

13:17.679 --> 13:22.098
Everyone is just walking out of the village
presenting bits of shrapnel and shells.

13:25.437 --> 13:28.821
He's saying that
five of these were dropped.

13:28.940 --> 13:35.912
"Dispense and Bomb,
Aircraft CBU87B/B."

13:35.997 --> 13:38.915
So this is inside this shell.

13:39.000 --> 13:43.119
These are all placed around
there, so eight on each level

13:43.204 --> 13:46.122
and there must be...
well, roughly,

13:46.258 --> 13:50.627
one, two, three,
four, five, six...

13:50.762 --> 13:54.347
<i>Each shell contains
202 bomblets.</i>

13:54.466 --> 13:59.135
Most countries have signed an international
treaty saying they won't use these,

13:59.220 --> 14:05.058
and most countries would say that using
these on civilian areas is illegal.

14:05.143 --> 14:07.860
<i>And where does Saudi Arabia
get most of its arms?</i>

14:07.979 --> 14:09.812
<i>They're mostly supplied
by the US,</i>

14:09.898 --> 14:11.531
<i>who have agreed
to sell the Saudis</i>

14:11.650 --> 14:15.285
<i>over $90 billion worth of weapons
over the last six years,</i>

14:15.370 --> 14:20.873
<i>including a contract worth $640
million for cluster bombs alone.</i>

14:20.992 --> 14:23.793
<i>Despite the mounting
evidence of war crimes,</i>

14:23.878 --> 14:25.795
<i>the support
continues to this day.</i>

14:38.927 --> 14:41.010
How many times have
you had to hide in here?

14:42.564 --> 14:43.930
Every night, for two months?

14:46.351 --> 14:50.069
How about that? Sleeping out
here for two months straight

14:50.188 --> 14:53.856
while cluster bombs
are dropped all around you.

14:53.992 --> 14:57.527
<i>Officially, the death toll has
risen to over 6,000 people,</i>

14:57.662 --> 14:59.529
<i>nearly half of them civilians.</i>

14:59.614 --> 15:02.699
<i>The actual number is almost
certainly much higher.</i>

15:02.784 --> 15:06.619
Why do you think this area
and your family were targeted?

15:08.673 --> 15:11.341
And were there fighters here?
Or are you a fighter?

15:18.883 --> 15:20.299
Are the jets still
flying over now?

15:27.025 --> 15:29.392
When the United States
Supreme Court struck down

15:29.527 --> 15:31.394
bans on same-sex marriage
last year,

15:31.529 --> 15:34.864
<i>many Americans believed that
full equality was imminent.</i>

15:34.949 --> 15:37.734
<i>But for the LGBT community
in dozens of states,</i>

15:37.869 --> 15:41.404
discrimination is still
a fact of everyday life.

16:00.341 --> 16:03.760
We're at the Supreme Court. They
just legalized same-sex marriage,

16:03.895 --> 16:06.512
and there are hundreds of
people out here celebrating.

16:09.100 --> 16:12.518
Tell me about the moments when you
heard the decision come down?

16:16.524 --> 16:17.690
I'm so happy.

16:17.776 --> 16:21.077
Yeah. The country
just became a better place.

16:21.162 --> 16:24.197
I never thought I could
get married. I can.

16:24.282 --> 16:27.283
Today is a wonderful day
to be an American.

16:27.419 --> 16:30.253
<i>This Supreme Court ruling
brought millions of people</i>

16:30.338 --> 16:31.537
<i>across the country together</i>

16:31.623 --> 16:34.624
<i>in celebration of a historic
civil rights victory.</i>

16:34.709 --> 16:36.793
This morning,
the Supreme Court recognized

16:36.878 --> 16:39.595
that the Constitution
guarantees marriage equality.

16:39.681 --> 16:44.300
<i>In doing so, they have reaffirmed that
all Americans should be treated equally,</i>

16:44.436 --> 16:47.136
regardless of who they are
or who they love.

16:47.222 --> 16:49.105
<i>But while many
cheered the decision,</i>

16:49.190 --> 16:51.307
<i>the Christian Right
rallied against it,</i>

16:51.392 --> 16:57.029
<i>using their right to religious liberty as
a kind of loophole to ignore the court.</i>

16:57.148 --> 17:00.817
<i>County officials in Texas,
Alabama, and Kentucky refused</i>

17:00.952 --> 17:03.536
<i>to issue marriage licenses
to same-sex couples.</i>

17:03.655 --> 17:08.207
The law of nature supersedes
anything that man puts on paper.

17:09.711 --> 17:11.210
<i>Thousands of people convened</i>

17:11.329 --> 17:13.412
<i>at back-to-back
conservative conferences</i>

17:13.498 --> 17:15.498
<i>where Republican
presidential candidates</i>

17:15.633 --> 17:18.334
<i>promised to back
religious liberty.</i>

17:18.470 --> 17:21.887
I don't think caterers, or
florists, or business owners

17:22.006 --> 17:24.507
should be forced to participate
in wedding ceremonies

17:24.592 --> 17:26.092
that violate their
sincerely held beliefs.

17:26.176 --> 17:28.928
We're going to protect the
religious liberty of individuals,

17:29.013 --> 17:32.348
churches, adoption agencies,
universities, and hospitals,

17:32.433 --> 17:36.152
to continue to practice their faith
unrestricted by the government.

17:36.237 --> 17:38.688
Do you think that
hospitals should have the choice

17:38.773 --> 17:40.907
whether or not
to serve same-sex couples?

17:41.025 --> 17:43.409
The government has
no constitutional authority

17:43.528 --> 17:45.945
to dictate the confines
of a person's faith.

17:46.030 --> 17:48.364
First Amendment's
explicitly clear on that.

17:49.918 --> 17:53.703
The only force strong enough to turn
this country around is we the people,

17:53.838 --> 17:56.622
and that's exactly
what we're going to do

17:56.708 --> 18:00.543
because this is our time
to take America back.

18:04.382 --> 18:06.432
<i>This fiery message
reached many more</i>

18:06.551 --> 18:08.718
<i>than just the cheering
fans at the conference.</i>

18:08.803 --> 18:11.554
<i>The host, Erick Erickson,
invited us to join him</i>

18:11.689 --> 18:13.222
<i>on his conservative radio show</i>

18:13.358 --> 18:16.058
<i>to talk about this movement
to his thousands of listeners.</i>

18:16.194 --> 18:20.196
Your News 95.5, AM 750. Welcome.
It's Erick Erickson here.

18:20.281 --> 18:21.697
I've got "VICE" here with me.

18:21.783 --> 18:23.663
We wanted to talk a little
bit about gay rights,

18:23.701 --> 18:25.234
religious freedom,
same-sex marriage.

18:25.370 --> 18:28.070
This has all been a hot-button
issue for Americans.

18:28.206 --> 18:32.325
Why are more states proposing that they have
religious freedom laws in their states?

18:32.410 --> 18:35.745
Because we've seen it around the
country in a number of situations,

18:35.830 --> 18:37.463
businesses targeted, saying,

18:37.582 --> 18:41.467
you will provide goods and
services to a marriage ceremony

18:41.586 --> 18:44.253
that you believe to be religious,
and if you don't do it,

18:44.389 --> 18:46.806
we're gonna take your business from
you or drive you from business.

18:46.925 --> 18:49.425
With the Supreme Court
legalizing same-sex marriage,

18:49.510 --> 18:52.395
do you think that that weakened
the religious freedom movement?

18:52.480 --> 18:55.731
I don't actually think it did.
It suddenly woke people up.

18:55.817 --> 18:59.602
You saw the support for same-sex
marriage decline after the decision.

18:59.687 --> 19:02.355
You also saw Christian
business protection go up.

19:02.440 --> 19:04.740
So you think it actually,
maybe, emboldened the movement?

19:04.826 --> 19:06.776
I think it probably did
embolden the movement.

19:06.911 --> 19:08.611
<i>And the leaders
of that movement?</i>

19:08.746 --> 19:12.031
<i>Countless business owners who
continue to stand their ground</i>

19:12.116 --> 19:14.617
<i>in refusing to serve
same-sex couples.</i>

19:14.752 --> 19:18.671
I couldn't do his flowers because
it would dishonor Christ.

19:18.790 --> 19:22.158
<i>It's against our belief
to cater to their wedding.</i>

19:22.260 --> 19:24.043
We're condoning that
if we do that,

19:24.128 --> 19:26.178
and that is
against our religion.

19:26.297 --> 19:30.016
<i>In Colorado, Masterpiece
Cakeshop owner Jack Phillips</i>

19:30.134 --> 19:32.802
<i>refused to bake a wedding cake
for two gay men.</i>

19:32.887 --> 19:36.105
<i>The state ruled that he had violated
an anti-discrimination law.</i>

19:36.190 --> 19:39.725
<i>He's now looking to take his case
to the Colorado Supreme Court.</i>

19:39.811 --> 19:42.144
How has the community
reacted to your case?

19:42.230 --> 19:44.063
The community reacted
really well.

19:44.148 --> 19:45.648
They've been
very supportive of us.

19:45.783 --> 19:49.151
I started getting phone calls
pretty much nonstop all day.

19:49.287 --> 19:51.704
I would answer the call,
hang up, and it would ring,

19:51.823 --> 19:53.789
and hang up,
and it would ring, nonstop.

19:53.875 --> 19:55.708
Even with your religious
beliefs, can you understand

19:55.827 --> 19:59.962
how a gay couple coming in here
would feel discriminated against?

20:00.048 --> 20:02.999
I would think that
if I came in expecting

20:03.134 --> 20:05.718
to be treated one way
and was treated another,

20:05.837 --> 20:08.838
that I would go somewhere else.

20:08.973 --> 20:13.509
Americans have the right to live
and work according to their faith.

20:13.594 --> 20:17.480
There's an anti-discrimination law for
sexual orientation in the state of Colorado.

20:17.565 --> 20:19.065
Do you think that should exist?

20:19.183 --> 20:22.485
Um, the courts need to look at
that anti-discrimination law,

20:22.570 --> 20:24.270
compare it
to the US Constitution,

20:24.355 --> 20:26.272
and see which one's
more valuable.

20:26.357 --> 20:28.240
I'm gonna go
with the Constitution.

20:28.359 --> 20:29.959
<i>But it isn't
just wedding vendors</i>

20:29.994 --> 20:31.744
<i>who are refusing
to serve gay clients.</i>

20:31.863 --> 20:34.280
<i>LGBT people are
reporting discrimination</i>

20:34.365 --> 20:37.616
<i>in employment, housing,
and even medical care.</i>

20:37.702 --> 20:40.336
<i>A veteran of those battles
is Dana Nessel,</i>

20:40.421 --> 20:42.038
<i>a prominent civil rights lawyer</i>

20:42.123 --> 20:45.624
<i>who has taken cases as far
as the Supreme Court.</i>

20:45.710 --> 20:48.711
The Religious Right
have found an angle

20:48.796 --> 20:53.049
to use religion as a sword
instead of a shield.

20:53.134 --> 20:56.052
And what about
the business owners who say,

20:56.137 --> 20:59.438
"I'm one shop of ten other shops

20:59.557 --> 21:01.057
that a couple could go to"?

21:01.192 --> 21:04.610
Once you say it's okay
for one person to discriminate

21:04.729 --> 21:07.229
against a same-sex couple,

21:07.315 --> 21:09.365
you're really leaving
the door open

21:09.450 --> 21:12.568
for all businesses to have
that same opportunity.

21:12.653 --> 21:16.288
People who oppose same-sex
marriage seem to believe

21:16.407 --> 21:18.791
that their sense of morality

21:18.910 --> 21:21.043
should be imposed
on the rest of the population.

21:21.129 --> 21:24.797
<i>Two of Dana's clients,
Krista and Jami Contreras,</i>

21:24.916 --> 21:27.049
<i>who were
legally married in 2012,</i>

21:27.135 --> 21:30.086
<i>have experienced that reality
time and time again.</i>

21:33.391 --> 21:36.809
<i>When Bay was six days
old, we took her to the doctor</i>

21:36.928 --> 21:39.929
who we had met with previously,

21:40.064 --> 21:42.181
liked her, and then
when we showed up,

21:42.266 --> 21:44.016
another doctor
greeted us in the room

21:44.102 --> 21:45.851
and told us that
she would be our doctor,

21:45.937 --> 21:48.738
and we were both like,
"Whoa, whoa. Why?

21:48.823 --> 21:52.274
"Like, what's going on? What happened
to the doctor that we met with?"

21:52.360 --> 21:54.110
And she said,
"Well, she prayed on it,

21:54.245 --> 21:56.612
"and she decided she can't
take Bay on as a patient."

21:56.748 --> 21:58.614
We wanted to run out,
but we couldn't

21:58.699 --> 22:01.339
because we already had a six-day-old
and we needed this appointment.

22:01.369 --> 22:05.871
She wrote this letter basically
trying to justify her actions.

22:05.957 --> 22:09.625
It was like, "I couldn't treat you
like I treat my normal patients."

22:09.761 --> 22:12.461
She's the one thing that
should be the most sacred,

22:12.597 --> 22:16.132
and we couldn't even protect our
daughter at a doctor's office.

22:16.217 --> 22:19.351
And she's not gay.
You know? We are!

22:22.723 --> 22:24.356
<i>This isn't a one-off.</i>

22:24.475 --> 22:28.644
<i>Doctors can legally refuse to care
for LGBT patients and their children</i>

22:28.780 --> 22:31.147
<i>in more than half
the states in the country.</i>

22:31.232 --> 22:32.782
<i>But even when they don't,</i>

22:32.867 --> 22:37.119
<i>these families can face a system that
erodes a parent's most basic rights.</i>

22:38.623 --> 22:41.323
I'm in Austin, Texas, to meet
up with a lesbian couple

22:41.409 --> 22:43.576
<i>who just gave birth
to a baby boy.</i>

22:43.661 --> 22:46.712
<i>One of the mothers, Robin,
is the one who gave birth</i>

22:46.831 --> 22:50.166
<i>and she actually used
her wife, Leigh's, embryo.</i>

22:50.301 --> 22:52.168
<i>The issue they're having
now is legally</i>

22:52.253 --> 22:56.806
<i>they can't get Leigh, the biological
mother's name on the birth certificate.</i>

22:56.891 --> 22:59.341
As soon as he came, it was
just overwhelming happiness.

22:59.477 --> 23:00.976
He cried right away.

23:01.062 --> 23:03.512
It seemed like he cried before they
had even gotten him all the way out.

23:03.648 --> 23:08.184
He's... I'm speechless
over him, literally.

23:08.269 --> 23:11.353
The birth certificate application,
all the options that it gives you,

23:11.439 --> 23:15.357
there's no option for being married
to someone of the same sex.

23:15.493 --> 23:18.527
We filled in that she was married
to the child's other mother,

23:18.613 --> 23:21.530
and I struck through father
and wrote mother.

23:21.666 --> 23:24.700
We submitted that form
and the person who's in charge

23:24.836 --> 23:26.702
of the birth certificates here
at the hospital came in.

23:26.787 --> 23:29.004
They brought in
a Verification of Birth Facts,

23:29.090 --> 23:32.758
but it didn't have me
listed on that verification.

23:32.877 --> 23:35.044
The way the state of Texas
is interpreting the law,

23:35.129 --> 23:38.214
even though you're the
biological mother of William,

23:38.299 --> 23:40.015
you're still not
his legal mother?

23:40.101 --> 23:44.186
I have absolutely no legal
rights to William right now.

23:44.272 --> 23:46.889
Could William be on your
health-care plan? No.

23:47.024 --> 23:48.774
Could you request
medical records?

23:48.893 --> 23:51.560
I don't think that a doctor
would necessarily release

23:51.646 --> 23:55.648
any of his records to me at this
point because of HIPAA regulations.

23:55.733 --> 23:58.651
If something were to happen to Robin,
would you gain custody of William?

23:58.736 --> 24:02.037
I would hope that the state would
allow him to stay with me,

24:02.123 --> 24:03.489
but I don't know
that they would.

24:03.574 --> 24:05.908
Well, it's
terrifying, obviously.

24:07.378 --> 24:11.747
I mean, we... We've built this
family and to think that...

24:11.832 --> 24:14.750
that if something were to
happen to me on the way home,

24:14.886 --> 24:17.219
you know, where would he go?

24:18.389 --> 24:20.172
<i>Robin and Leigh
joined in support</i>

24:20.258 --> 24:22.258
<i>of another family
that was suing the state</i>

24:22.343 --> 24:24.426
<i>in a case that
ultimately established</i>

24:24.512 --> 24:27.062
<i>same-sex parents'
rights in Texas.</i>

24:27.148 --> 24:28.898
<i>But in dozens of other states,</i>

24:28.983 --> 24:32.651
<i>local governments are still
fighting against gay rights.</i>

24:32.770 --> 24:38.524
<i>Last year, more than 100 anti-LGBT
bills were introduced in 31 states,</i>

24:38.609 --> 24:42.912
<i>and one of the driving forces
behind this movement is Alan Sears,</i>

24:42.997 --> 24:45.748
<i>the president and CEO
of a powerful group</i>

24:45.833 --> 24:48.284
<i>called the Alliance
Defending Freedom.</i>

24:48.369 --> 24:51.203
Where is the next battle
for religious liberty?

24:51.289 --> 24:53.956
The battle of the moment
is the rights of conscience.

24:54.091 --> 24:57.209
Basically, your right
to follow these teachings

24:57.295 --> 25:00.796
and these understandings of
these laws outside of yourself.

25:00.881 --> 25:03.098
You understand that law
is given by God.

25:03.184 --> 25:06.101
Some people say
it came from Sinai,

25:06.187 --> 25:07.636
and it's non-negotiable.

25:07.722 --> 25:10.022
The bible, written thousands
of years ago, right?

25:10.141 --> 25:13.642
this was a bible that
also condoned slavery

25:13.778 --> 25:17.279
and actually advised how to
treat and buy and sell slaves,

25:17.365 --> 25:19.448
and how slaves should treat
their masters and all of that.

25:19.533 --> 25:21.483
We obviously don't take
that part of the bible,

25:21.619 --> 25:24.236
so why do we take the part of the
bible that talks about marriage?

25:24.322 --> 25:28.207
We need a world in which people
learn to live without hate,

25:28.326 --> 25:31.160
and those are
the portions of the bible

25:31.245 --> 25:33.078
that relate to everything
we're talking about.

25:33.164 --> 25:37.633
We need people to learn to accept
one another, to love one another,

25:37.718 --> 25:41.170
and part of that is not
to force people to do things

25:41.255 --> 25:44.974
that violate their deepest,
innermost core beliefs.

25:45.059 --> 25:46.976
How do you explain to a viewer,

25:47.061 --> 25:49.428
who let's say,
has been refused service,

25:49.513 --> 25:53.182
that the person on the other side of
the counter is not a hateful person?

25:53.267 --> 25:56.902
What I find are people
who are deeply caring,

25:57.021 --> 26:01.073
loving people who actually care
for the prospective client

26:01.192 --> 26:03.909
probably more than the prospective
client could imagine.

26:04.028 --> 26:07.613
I think the opposing argument though would
be having a well-formed conscience,

26:07.698 --> 26:10.532
would be treating others as
you would like to be treated.

26:10.668 --> 26:14.036
Wouldn't that be serving all
Americans no matter who they are?

26:14.171 --> 26:18.090
What person really wants
someone who disagrees

26:18.209 --> 26:20.926
to be involved in creative
services for that person?

26:21.045 --> 26:23.806
Actually, I think a lot of people.
That's why they've brought lawsuits.

26:23.848 --> 26:25.681
Well, it's interesting.

26:25.766 --> 26:29.218
Do you really want to do that to other
people? See, tolerance is a two-way street.

26:29.353 --> 26:33.055
And the essence of religious
freedom is free will.

26:33.190 --> 26:36.058
<i>This effort to
reverse the marriage ruling,</i>

26:36.193 --> 26:37.559
<i>and the fact
that it's still legal</i>

26:37.645 --> 26:41.063
<i>to evict, fire, and refuse
to serve LGBT people</i>

26:41.198 --> 26:42.648
<i>in more than half the country,</i>

26:42.733 --> 26:45.117
<i>is for Senator Cory Booker,
a call back</i>

26:45.236 --> 26:47.736
<i>to the civil rights battles
of the past.</i>

26:47.872 --> 26:52.207
There were religious arguments used
to subjugate women in this country.

26:52.293 --> 26:56.045
There were religious arguments used to
subjugate minorities in this country.

26:56.130 --> 26:58.714
When my family
was facing discrimination,

26:58.799 --> 27:01.133
to tell my parents, hey,
that you've come a long way,

27:01.252 --> 27:03.752
be satisfied with
how far you are.

27:03.838 --> 27:07.222
Well, no, absolutely not.
That's not enough.

27:07.308 --> 27:10.759
We want to have full
citizenship rights as blacks.

27:10.845 --> 27:13.979
Do you think that it's fair to compare
those two civil rights movements?

27:14.098 --> 27:17.433
Well, I think a lot of people are sensitive
about those kind of comparisons,

27:17.518 --> 27:19.518
but I was taught by my parents

27:19.603 --> 27:22.771
that the civil rights movement
was not about black justice,

27:22.857 --> 27:24.406
it was about American justice.

27:24.492 --> 27:29.111
It took a whole lot of actions
by a lot of people

27:29.196 --> 27:32.614
to break the housing discrimination
that my parents encountered.

27:32.700 --> 27:36.368
At least my parents knew back then
that they had a legal appeal.

27:36.454 --> 27:40.956
A gay couple does not have the force of
law behind them like my parents did.

27:41.092 --> 27:42.458
<i>To remedy that,</i>

27:42.543 --> 27:44.710
<i>Senator Booker has
co-sponsored legislation</i>

27:44.795 --> 27:48.630
<i>that would federally prohibit
discrimination against LGBT people.</i>

27:48.716 --> 27:52.551
<i>But even though more and more Americans
recognize gay people as equals,</i>

27:52.636 --> 27:55.354
<i>opponents of same-sex marriage
have dug in</i>

27:55.473 --> 27:59.274
<i>and they're fighting to move
history in a different direction.</i>

28:00.361 --> 28:02.311
The story of this nation
is a story of evolution,

28:02.446 --> 28:05.147
of us more and more recognizing
the dignity of people,

28:05.232 --> 28:07.282
and we can't stop now.

28:09.153 --> 28:12.454
What would it take for the ADF
to back down in this battle?

28:12.540 --> 28:14.990
One of the analogies
that I'm often asked about

28:15.075 --> 28:16.625
is the civil rights movement.

28:16.710 --> 28:20.162
And I remember one of those
lawyers was once asked a question

28:20.247 --> 28:21.663
similar to what you asked me.

28:21.799 --> 28:23.499
They said,
"When will you quit?"

28:23.634 --> 28:27.336
And they said they would
quit when they had won.

28:27.471 --> 28:30.422
Is that your answer?
That would be my answer.
