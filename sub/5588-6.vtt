        (ducks chirping)

00:03.771 --> 00:05.871
        Come on. Why aren't they
           transferring to me?

00:05.873 --> 00:07.439
           I look just like you.

00:07.441 --> 00:08.841
               Maybe I don't
           have the scent right.

00:12.380 --> 00:15.214
        A few weeks ago,
  I found a nest of duck eggs.

00:15.216 --> 00:17.883
            I, uh...
    I lovingly nursed them,

00:17.885 --> 00:21.887
         and then, uh,
     by some...sick fluke,

00:21.889 --> 00:23.722
 Claire was the only one there
   when the ducks were born,

00:23.724 --> 00:27.292
  so they imprinted
       on her.

00:27.294 --> 00:28.794
             Oh, I didn't do it
                 on purpose.

00:28.796 --> 00:30.796
   Then make them
  come back to me.
                             Mm.

00:30.798 --> 00:32.531
       (telephone rings)

00:32.533 --> 00:34.533
    Who's calling
    at this hour?

00:34.535 --> 00:36.368
            (beep)
                  Hello?

00:36.370 --> 00:37.469
                  Yes?

00:37.471 --> 00:39.338
           Luke's been arrested!

        (birds chirping)

00:52.920 --> 00:56.188
                   Well,
          good morning, Leonard.

00:56.190 --> 00:57.656
      Leonar--

00:57.658 --> 00:59.191
            I know it's not
      my well-behaved son, Luke,

00:59.193 --> 01:01.026
    who'd never take our car out
          without a license

01:01.028 --> 01:02.261
              and get arrested.

01:02.263 --> 01:04.096
         I took the car
       for a good reason.

01:04.098 --> 01:06.598
    Sarah Fisher's cat died,
    and she was devastated,

01:06.600 --> 01:09.334
          so I thought
  she might make out with me.

01:09.336 --> 01:12.337
  I got caught two blocks away
        from her house.

01:12.339 --> 01:15.441
 Everyone is having great luck
   with girls except for me.

01:15.443 --> 01:17.609
      And I mean everyone.

01:17.611 --> 01:20.379
       When is a tuba-strap rash
         not a tuba-strap rash?

01:20.381 --> 01:23.782
             When it's hickeys.

01:23.784 --> 01:25.117
   You know, we're gonna have to
            ground you,

01:25.119 --> 01:26.452
                  and I was
              thinking that --

01:26.454 --> 01:27.853
        Oh, we're doing
      way more than that.

01:27.855 --> 01:29.922
     Landon has a $300 fine
          to work off.

01:29.924 --> 01:32.257
 We could fight that --
say the cop was racist.

01:32.259 --> 01:34.560
      Even if we lose,
it'll start a conversation.

01:34.562 --> 01:37.896
      You made a mistake,
you pay the consequences, Levon.

01:37.898 --> 01:39.364
         Your first job
        is cleaning out

01:39.366 --> 01:41.033
      the awesome village
     I built for my ducks.

01:41.035 --> 01:42.468
Aren't they Mom's ducks?

01:42.470 --> 01:44.970
     Do you really want to
      test me right now?!

01:44.972 --> 01:46.805
     Well, you, sir,
take your time deciding.

01:46.807 --> 01:48.307
       We'll be here
just as sure as a coonhound

01:48.309 --> 01:50.876
      takes a summer nap
in the shade of a chifferobe.

01:50.878 --> 01:52.945
  Okay, now you're just randomly
      throwing words together

01:52.947 --> 01:54.446
                   from
         <i> To Kill a Mockingbird.</i>

01:54.448 --> 01:57.116
           It was a boon year
       for tomatoes on the farm,

01:57.118 --> 01:59.785
        or what we're calling...

01:59.787 --> 02:01.487
                Tomatogeddon.

02:01.489 --> 02:03.956
     So they made an extra-large
      batch of Tucker's Famous,

02:03.958 --> 02:05.624
           and we're selling it
         at the farmers' market.

02:05.626 --> 02:07.126
          Now,
when you say "famous" --

02:07.128 --> 02:09.127
       It's known Missouri-wide.

02:09.130 --> 02:12.164
 A death-row inmate requested it
        for his last meal.

02:12.166 --> 02:13.499
    Well, at least
 I'm trying to sell.

02:13.501 --> 02:15.000
  What is going on?

02:15.002 --> 02:16.668
              After buying
       whatever they're selling,

02:16.670 --> 02:19.505
       I'm guessing people are
     plum out of spending money.

02:19.507 --> 02:21.673
      Wait. No.

02:21.675 --> 02:23.775
It's Andrew and Simon.

02:23.777 --> 02:25.777
   Thank you. Oh.

02:25.779 --> 02:27.613
             Hello.
                      Oh, hello!

02:27.615 --> 02:30.449
     Here to try our hand-caught
        artisanal trout jerky?

02:30.451 --> 02:32.151
              -No.
  -It's selling like hotcakes.

02:32.153 --> 02:33.352
       Actually, better.

02:33.354 --> 02:34.987
         See the vegan
        hotcakes stand?

02:34.989 --> 02:36.989
            Next to
    the bespoke honey stall.

02:36.991 --> 02:39.158
    We should be careful.
This market might be a trick

02:39.160 --> 02:41.493
to get a whole bunch of white
 people together in one spot.

02:41.495 --> 02:43.162
              I'm actually glad
                 you're here.

02:43.164 --> 02:45.664
            We're looking for
         a new senior associate,

02:45.666 --> 02:47.166
               and I was gonna
                  call you.

02:47.168 --> 02:49.501
    Call me what?
     A has-been?

02:49.503 --> 02:51.003
      "Mitch ado
   about nothing"?

02:51.005 --> 02:52.604
Why am I doing your work
        for you?

02:52.606 --> 02:55.274
        Look, on a social level,
          I find you hopeless,

02:55.276 --> 02:57.776
          but I always thought
       you were a good lawyer --

02:57.778 --> 02:59.645
              maybe a great one
             at the right firm.

02:59.647 --> 03:02.147
      Honey, did you bring
      the other cash box?

03:02.149 --> 03:03.448
     This one's filled up.

03:04.485 --> 03:05.617
               Think about it.

03:07.121 --> 03:09.454
         Come on, Joe!

03:09.456 --> 03:11.456
I don't want to learn!

03:11.458 --> 03:13.158
     But you have to learn!

03:13.160 --> 03:14.826
       And it's so easy.

03:14.828 --> 03:18.330
          Look, first,
    you make the little man,

03:18.332 --> 03:21.967
     then you tie the rope
      around its throat --

03:21.969 --> 03:23.368
       No!

03:23.370 --> 03:24.736
          Joe, don't worry about
             tying your shoes.

03:24.738 --> 03:26.138
            That's for big boys.

03:26.140 --> 03:27.973
         Don't tell him
           he can't.

03:27.975 --> 03:30.509
  He can't, but he'll be fine --
  Kid has thick, beautiful hair.

03:30.511 --> 03:32.678
  -Can I get back to work now?
        -You're working?

03:32.680 --> 03:33.679
      But it's not
between 10:00 and 2:00,

03:33.681 --> 03:34.880
Monday through Thursday.

03:34.882 --> 03:36.148
               Well, I wasn't
            gonna tell you guys,

03:36.150 --> 03:37.482
               'cause I knew
          you'd make a big fuss,

03:37.484 --> 03:39.718
     but the Chamber of Commerce
             is giving me

03:39.720 --> 03:41.253
     a Titans of Industry award.

03:41.255 --> 03:43.088
   They asked me to make a video
          for the ceremony

03:43.090 --> 03:45.424
           about what drives me.

03:45.426 --> 03:47.226
      JAY: After 30 years

03:47.228 --> 03:49.695
  and over a hundred thousand
     hanger rods installed,

03:49.697 --> 03:52.364
          some people
   would kick back and relax.

03:52.366 --> 03:53.865
            Not me.
       I'm Jay Pritchett.

03:53.867 --> 03:55.234
       (telephone rings)

03:55.236 --> 03:56.568
      Pritchett's Closets.

03:56.570 --> 03:58.737
  Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down!

03:58.739 --> 04:01.406
 How many closets do you need?

04:01.408 --> 04:04.509
    Yeah. I can handle that.

04:04.511 --> 04:07.279
It's great.
              I'm starting over.

04:07.281 --> 04:08.947
     Why?
            You guys were bored,

04:08.949 --> 04:11.416
       and the video obviously
     doesn't capture my essence.

04:11.418 --> 04:14.419
    You think that fellow titan
  Ed Fisk, the Lion of Linoleum,

04:14.421 --> 04:15.554
        would make that mistake?

04:15.556 --> 04:16.887
How big is this event?

04:16.890 --> 04:18.790
Is there going to be
    a red carpet?

04:18.791 --> 04:21.627
      No, but Red Murtaugh, of
   Red's Carpets, will be there.

04:21.629 --> 04:24.296
        I'm walking with giants,
                 Gloria,

04:24.298 --> 04:26.765
           and that's a good way
             to get stepped on.

04:26.767 --> 04:28.433
   (indistinct conversations)

04:28.435 --> 04:30.202
  Oh, there are two
     over there.

04:30.204 --> 04:32.771
Oh, good. For a second, I didn't
   think we were gonna find...

04:32.773 --> 04:35.607
                  Hey,
       isn't that Beth and Andy?

04:35.609 --> 04:38.644
  Um, actually, uh,
those two are better.

04:38.646 --> 04:40.245
            But all those people
            would be between us.

04:40.247 --> 04:42.247
      Yeah, but, you know,
   we spent all day together.

04:42.249 --> 04:43.982
            I just --
Hey. Hey, you two.

04:43.984 --> 04:46.318
           Hey, Andy. Very cool
         you're not fat anymore.

04:46.320 --> 04:48.287
              Hi!
     Nice to see you guys!

04:48.289 --> 04:49.621
        We really should
  go find seats before the m--

04:49.623 --> 04:52.190
         MAN:
  Sit down, please.

04:53.894 --> 04:54.893
            (clank)

04:54.895 --> 04:56.561
  Ever since Andy got engaged,

04:56.563 --> 04:58.497
       things between us
        have been weird.

04:58.499 --> 04:59.798
 Like "a woman with olive skin

04:59.800 --> 05:01.166
  trying to pull off red hair"
             weird.

05:01.168 --> 05:02.668
I just wanted to watch the movie

05:02.670 --> 05:04.936
      and get out of there
     before it got awkward.

05:04.938 --> 05:06.605
         WOMAN:
I still think about you.

05:06.607 --> 05:09.107
           MAN: Me too.
  But I'm with someone else now.

05:09.109 --> 05:10.442
            I made a commitment.

05:10.444 --> 05:11.943
     But do you
  really love her?

05:11.945 --> 05:13.779
                         Zombie!
            (gunshot)

05:13.781 --> 05:15.414
            Got it!

05:15.416 --> 05:18.183
   Anyway, we really should have
   told each other how we felt.

05:20.421 --> 05:22.921
        Nothing? Really?

05:22.923 --> 05:25.190
          I could not
 get out of there fast enough.

05:25.192 --> 05:26.591
        What's the rush?
       Sometimes they put

05:26.593 --> 05:28.193
       a funny skit thing
      after all the names.

05:28.195 --> 05:30.362
             Hey. Guys, wait up.

05:30.364 --> 05:32.331
    You want to go grab a burger
        and a beer next door?

05:32.333 --> 05:33.999
           Well, I --
I definitely do.

05:34.001 --> 05:36.168
That movie brought up
   so much for me.

05:36.170 --> 05:38.003
Plus, I got to take my pill
         with food.

05:38.005 --> 05:39.971
    Yeah, I'm not so sure --
                 You're coming.

05:39.973 --> 05:41.640
               Oh.
          Maybe if you're there,

05:41.642 --> 05:43.975
        he won't try and do
  his adorable British character

05:43.977 --> 05:46.645
              for the hostess.

05:46.647 --> 05:48.480
  Will you put this
 in my veggie burger

05:48.482 --> 05:51.083
   and not tell me
     where it is?

05:55.956 --> 05:57.356
             (beep)
      Hey, Lloyd, it's your dad,

05:57.358 --> 05:58.657
    A.K.A. your worst nightmare.

05:58.659 --> 06:00.292
             Just reminding you
              the duck village

06:00.294 --> 06:02.127
        needs to be clean enough
             to eat off of.

06:02.129 --> 06:03.962
                You hear me?
            You better not have.

06:03.964 --> 06:05.297
           You're not allowed to
              use your phone.

06:05.299 --> 06:07.999
            Yep, I'm everywhere.
            (beep)

06:08.001 --> 06:10.469
You think maybe you're being
     a bit hard on Luke?

06:10.471 --> 06:13.071
      We're his parents, Claire.
      It's our job to keep him
      off the stripper pole.

06:13.073 --> 06:15.974
I actually like that he's being
    a little bit rebellious.

06:15.976 --> 06:18.477
Sometimes, between the magic
    and the trampolining,

06:18.479 --> 06:22.514
I think he's getting a little...
            you know.

06:22.516 --> 06:23.849
  What are you trying to say,
            Claire?

06:23.851 --> 06:26.051
         A little...me?

06:26.053 --> 06:27.686
      There it was again,

06:27.688 --> 06:30.155
  the insinuation that I'm not
   dangerous enough for her.

06:30.157 --> 06:33.825
  Apparently, she's forgotten
       I've been to jail.

06:33.827 --> 06:36.828
 I once led 20 violent inmates
in a therapeutic tumbling class.

06:36.830 --> 06:38.830
     It was a huge success.

06:38.832 --> 06:40.999
       Could I have made
   the participation trophies

06:41.001 --> 06:42.701
     a little less stabby?

06:42.703 --> 06:43.869
             Sure.

06:43.871 --> 06:47.005
  But overall, a huge success.

06:47.007 --> 06:49.674
       When you say you're happy
       about Luke being a rebel,

06:49.676 --> 06:52.010
         it sounds a little like
           you're also saying...
Are you wearing my perfume?

06:52.012 --> 06:54.012
      It was to trick the ducks.
  Oh.

06:54.014 --> 06:55.514
  But like I was saying --

06:55.516 --> 06:56.915
 Hey, is that Alex?

06:56.917 --> 06:58.750
            It is. That's weird.

06:58.752 --> 07:01.086
    She said she was gonna be
 at school all weekend studying.

07:01.088 --> 07:02.954
            (beep)
           (ringing)

07:02.956 --> 07:04.790
             Hello?

07:04.792 --> 07:06.858
                     Hey, honey.
 Hi! I'm here, too.
How are you doing, honey?

07:06.860 --> 07:10.295
Oh, yeah, I'm good. I'm doing
some work. Really busy.

07:10.297 --> 07:11.963
                  Well,
        that's interesting, be--

07:11.965 --> 07:14.132
Yeah, we've got a boring day
      ahead of us, too.

07:14.134 --> 07:16.468
Heading down to the impound lot
       to pick up the car

07:16.470 --> 07:19.137
because, yes, your brother
 got arrested last night.

07:19.139 --> 07:21.306
           Oh! Okay.
      Well, that's great.

07:21.308 --> 07:23.875
   Yeah, I really got to go.
I left my stuff in the library.

07:23.877 --> 07:26.044
     And I'm really worried
someone's gonna steal my snacks.

07:26.046 --> 07:27.412
           Okay, bye!

07:27.414 --> 07:29.214
            Why did you stop me?
           I was gonna bust her.

07:29.216 --> 07:31.716
What? In a little lie?
   I mean, come on.

07:31.718 --> 07:33.251
    She's probably
  visiting a friend

07:33.253 --> 07:35.053
and she didn't want to
  hurt our feelings.

07:35.055 --> 07:37.222
    She barely reacted when she
   heard that Luke got arrested.

07:37.224 --> 07:38.924
               She's obviously
              hiding something.

07:38.926 --> 07:40.926
          And now she's walking
         into that liquor store.

07:40.928 --> 07:43.261
   Oh, no. Oh, no.
Now,<i> this</i> is serious.

07:43.263 --> 07:46.731
 A college student is visiting a
friend, and they're buying beer!

07:46.733 --> 07:48.233
       (gasps)
    Relax, Phil.

07:48.235 --> 07:49.734
      This girl
  has two patents.

07:49.736 --> 07:51.770
                What she needs
               is two <i> parents.</i>

07:51.772 --> 07:55.774
Okay, my point is, it wouldn't
    hurt Alex to loosen up.

07:55.776 --> 07:57.943
 I mean, I'm worried that
she's getting a little...

07:57.945 --> 07:59.578
             There it is again.

07:59.580 --> 08:01.012
          Just say it, Claire --

08:01.014 --> 08:02.414
                  You like
           our kids running wild

08:02.416 --> 08:03.748
           'cause you're worried
              they're too much

08:03.750 --> 08:05.283
                 like their
              namby-pamby dad,

08:05.285 --> 08:07.285
              Mr. Goody-goody,
           mayor of Vanillatown.

08:07.287 --> 08:09.421
      Is this 'cause
the ducks like me better?

08:09.423 --> 08:11.923
             That is biological,
               and you know it.

08:11.925 --> 08:13.258
                 There are
           videos of them online

08:13.260 --> 08:14.593
               following around
              a vacuum cleaner.

08:14.595 --> 08:15.994
       They're basically idiots!

08:15.996 --> 08:17.996
    Oh, my God. Hang on.
She's getting into that van.

08:17.998 --> 08:20.165
        Oh, now we're concerned!
Yes, I'm concerned!

08:20.167 --> 08:21.800
That is
a sketchy repair van

08:21.802 --> 08:23.835
that is probably being driven
by some middle-aged pervert

08:23.837 --> 08:26.037
with one long fingernail
that she met online.

08:26.039 --> 08:28.106
        (tires squeal)
Oh, my God, go! Follow them!

08:28.108 --> 08:29.374
(sighs)

08:29.376 --> 08:31.109
        Thank you for lending us
             Manny's easel.

08:31.111 --> 08:33.211
          Did everyone
        love the sauce?

08:33.212 --> 08:34.946
         Well, if by "everyone"
        you mean a thousand bees

08:34.948 --> 08:38.383
      and a pony that escaped
   from the riding circle, yeah.

08:38.385 --> 08:40.519
                  Oh, no --
            Is this one of those

08:40.520 --> 08:42.220
video wills where you make us
 compete in a scavenger hunt

08:42.222 --> 08:43.955
for your inheritance?

08:43.957 --> 08:46.458
            No. It's the video
            for my Titan award.
            I told you about it.

08:46.460 --> 08:48.827
          I'm trying to project
        strength and confidence.

08:48.829 --> 08:50.662
  Maybe you should lose the
Garfield "I hate Mondays" mug

08:50.664 --> 08:52.697
on the mantel.
                 Good catch.

08:52.699 --> 08:54.499
    I've waited my whole life
    to hear you say those words.

08:54.501 --> 08:56.167
       Want to help me out here?
    Yeah.

08:56.169 --> 08:57.335
   I needed the distraction.

08:57.337 --> 08:58.837
  I had spent enough of my day

08:58.839 --> 09:00.505
         obsessing over
       Simon's job offer.

09:00.507 --> 09:02.374
     Plus, I don't know --

09:02.376 --> 09:05.343
Seeing my big, strong dad reach
 out to me in a vulnerable way,

09:05.345 --> 09:07.312
           it was --
    it was kind of touching.

09:07.314 --> 09:09.648
             The red button!
         How do you not see it?!

09:09.650 --> 09:11.650
      Before you got here, I was
     turning it on with a broom!

09:11.652 --> 09:14.886
          Now just -- Forget it.
             Let's get lunch.

09:14.888 --> 09:17.355
       If I could just --
                Come with me!

09:17.357 --> 09:19.357
    Okay, hold the sauce in
your mouth, swirl it around --

09:19.359 --> 09:21.493
really coat your tongue.
      Now swallow.

09:21.495 --> 09:22.661
                   Mmm!

09:22.663 --> 09:24.663
   Right?
                Much better.

09:24.665 --> 09:26.331
                    (chuckles)
                 Okay, Jay,
    what you're gonna want to do

09:26.333 --> 09:28.333
    is hold the sauce
    in your mouth, sw--

09:28.335 --> 09:30.702
I know how eating works.

09:30.704 --> 09:32.370
  Not too shabby.
                 Thank you.

09:32.372 --> 09:34.706
  You know who else makes a mean
  sauce is Gloria's dead aunt.

09:34.708 --> 09:36.174
                     Oh.
Oh, there it is right there.

09:36.176 --> 09:37.576
Try some. I'm telling you,
it's life-changing.

09:37.578 --> 09:39.044
         I don't think
   we really need two sauces.

09:39.046 --> 09:40.345
         And sometimes,
  when you have sauces from --

09:40.347 --> 09:42.514
                    Now you eat.
              Mm.
Oh, yeah, huh?

09:42.516 --> 09:44.950
         Oh. Oh, my God.
        That is amazing.
Mmm.

09:44.952 --> 09:46.418
            It's a secret recipe

09:46.420 --> 09:48.753
      that has been in my family
           for generations.

09:48.755 --> 09:50.388
     Was your sauce buried
    in a local time capsule

09:50.390 --> 09:53.058
    during the bicentennial?
       Because mine was.

09:53.060 --> 09:56.061
    My Great-Aunt Miranda was
the only one that could make it,

09:56.063 --> 09:58.229
                and because I
             was the oldest girl

09:58.231 --> 09:59.898
              that didn't marry
                 a Peruvian,

09:59.900 --> 10:01.766
                 the recipe
             passed down to me.

10:01.768 --> 10:03.635
Sauce me.
             Right.

10:03.637 --> 10:06.104
   <i> Ay,</i> I don't have many things
   that remind me of Colombia

10:06.106 --> 10:07.772
             here in the house,
             but now I do.

10:07.774 --> 10:09.608
    Legend has it our sauce
         was so secret,

10:09.610 --> 10:11.276
    it was only written down
           one place.

10:11.278 --> 10:13.278
          We grew up eating this
               every Sunday,

10:13.280 --> 10:15.614
     and now Manny and Joe will,
                 too.

10:15.616 --> 10:17.449
   It was tattooed backwards
     on a lame stable boy.

10:17.451 --> 10:18.783
     You could only read it
          in a mirror.

10:18.785 --> 10:20.485
           (sniffs)
Mm, can I see that recipe?

10:20.487 --> 10:21.987
Uh, uh, well, I think it's
a little bit rude to read --

10:21.989 --> 10:23.421
                    <i> Ay!</i>
You pushed my hand!

10:23.423 --> 10:24.756
              You've ruined it!
                     No!

10:24.758 --> 10:26.424
     No, no! I can dry it!
         I can dry it!

10:26.426 --> 10:28.126
No, now the ink's running.
           Cam!

10:28.128 --> 10:31.596
     No, and now you have ruined
      my great-uncle's napkins!

10:31.598 --> 10:33.798
 Does -- Okay, does everything
  at this table have meaning?

10:33.800 --> 10:35.133
                   Ohh.

10:35.135 --> 10:36.468
Hey, sorry I'm late.

10:36.470 --> 10:37.902
My new lady, Rachel,
     needed help

10:37.904 --> 10:40.238
picking a pair of shorts
to make her stepdad mad.

10:40.240 --> 10:41.940
             I wonder what's
        more of a "screw you" --

10:41.942 --> 10:44.242
   you telling me that story or
  that the ducks now stare at me

10:44.244 --> 10:46.244
              while they slowly
             go to the bathroom?

10:46.246 --> 10:48.246
   Didn't you guys
  have three ducks?

10:48.248 --> 10:50.482
             Yeah -- one, two...

10:50.484 --> 10:51.850
                   Oh, no.

10:51.852 --> 10:53.018
    Uh-oh! Dude!

10:53.020 --> 10:54.519
                 No, no, no,
                 no, no, no!

10:54.521 --> 10:56.855
      (scoffs)
  Where did he go?

10:56.857 --> 11:00.525
          Hey, look, there's
     a duck-call app we can use.

11:00.527 --> 11:02.527
       Oh, crap. Not her.

11:02.529 --> 11:04.029
                What happened
               with this one?

11:04.031 --> 11:06.197
Well, I was seeing her
     for a while,

11:06.199 --> 11:07.866
   then she pulled
   her shade down.

11:07.868 --> 11:09.868
             Classy. Get ready.

11:09.870 --> 11:12.337
        (ducks quacking)

11:13.774 --> 11:16.274
                        Scatter!
                 Uh...uh...

11:16.276 --> 11:17.776
    What the hell
   are you doing?

11:17.778 --> 11:19.678
Are you taking pictures of me
    sleeping in a bikini?

11:19.680 --> 11:22.681
        No! I was just trying to
       lure that little duckling

11:22.683 --> 11:24.182
           back into
       my friend's yard.

11:24.184 --> 11:26.685
                   (gasps)
                 Oh, my God!

11:26.687 --> 11:28.687
                It's so cute!
   Thank you.

11:28.689 --> 11:30.321
   You're adorable
   for looking after him.

11:30.323 --> 11:32.123
        (duck chirping)

11:32.125 --> 11:34.492
    Hey, you know, I think I've
  seen you around school before.

11:34.494 --> 11:35.994
                 I'm Tammy.
      Manny.

11:35.996 --> 11:38.363
            You have
     got to be kidding me.

11:38.365 --> 11:40.532
                 What drives
               Jay Pritchett?

11:40.534 --> 11:42.701
                A desire
        never to repeat himself.

11:42.703 --> 11:43.868
           Let me do that again.

11:44.838 --> 11:47.539
   What drives Jay Pritchett?
            An Audi.

11:47.541 --> 11:49.374
    I'm gonna start with a joke?
     I'm following Red Murtaugh.

11:49.376 --> 11:50.709
            The man's hilarious.

11:50.711 --> 11:52.410
    You've seen him be that baby
             in his ads.

11:52.412 --> 11:54.012
  Just so you know,
 the camera only has

11:54.014 --> 11:55.513
11 hours of battery, so...
       Let's see what we've got.

11:55.515 --> 11:56.581
       Yep.

11:57.851 --> 12:00.018
                Why do I look
             so pale and sweaty?

12:00.020 --> 12:02.387
      Oh, well,
you're old and Irish.

12:04.224 --> 12:07.559
 Hey, um -- uh, Gloria, again,
I just want to say that I'm --

12:07.561 --> 12:09.394
                You're sorry?
                 You told me.

12:09.396 --> 12:12.497
Yes, and, uh -- excuse me --
  that it was an accident.

12:12.499 --> 12:13.898
                   Was it?

12:13.900 --> 12:15.934
   Yes, of course.

12:15.936 --> 12:18.269
      I think.
 I -- I don't know.

12:18.271 --> 12:21.439
You have destroyed my children's
    connection to their past,

12:21.441 --> 12:23.408
      and you might have done it
              on purpose?

12:23.410 --> 12:26.745
I'm sorry. Andrew humiliated me
 today at the farmers' market,

12:26.747 --> 12:29.581
and I've always been
sauce-competitive...

12:29.583 --> 12:31.750
Look, just let me help you
       re-create it.

12:31.752 --> 12:34.919
      I saw my aunt make it once
        when I was 8 years old.

12:34.921 --> 12:36.221
                You think
        I'm going to remember --

12:36.223 --> 12:37.288
  (car backfires in distance)

12:37.290 --> 12:39.591
             (gasps) Cilantro!
       What?

12:39.593 --> 12:43.094
          That car backfiring,
       it sounded like gunshots.

12:43.096 --> 12:46.598
  I remember when I was a little
    girl in my aunt's kitchen,

12:46.600 --> 12:50.101
        and she started chopping
        the cilantro really loud

12:50.103 --> 12:52.070
             so that we couldn't
               hear the noise.

12:52.072 --> 12:53.738
     Yes, okay. Well,
what else do you remember?

12:53.740 --> 12:55.740
             Well, nothing, Cam.
            It was 30 years ago.

12:55.742 --> 12:58.777
No, the recipe is inside you!
  It just needs to come out!

12:58.779 --> 13:02.213
       Mommy, I found it.
         (pig oinking)

13:02.215 --> 13:04.215
                Lemon juice!
       What?

13:04.217 --> 13:06.217
     Oh, see? I told you
     it's just a matter of time!

13:06.219 --> 13:08.553
         (siren wails)
               Capers, jalapeño,

13:08.555 --> 13:11.156
     and a dash of black pepper!
            (gasps)

13:15.962 --> 13:17.395
              It's just so sad.

13:17.397 --> 13:19.164
    The guy decides to
spend the rest of his life

13:19.166 --> 13:21.132
  with some zombie
  he doesn't love.

13:22.102 --> 13:24.269
      Your table is ready.
(British accent) Smashing!

13:24.271 --> 13:27.105
     -A bucket of chips --
     -We're not doing that.

13:27.107 --> 13:28.106
(normal voice) Okay.

13:28.108 --> 13:29.774
          Hey, um, real quick --

13:29.776 --> 13:32.610
Why wasn't it more uncomfortable
  for you to watch that movie?

13:32.612 --> 13:35.346
Right. Because zombies
  killed my parents.

13:35.348 --> 13:37.682
             Oh, never mind.
         I forgot you can't have
          an adult conversation.

13:37.684 --> 13:39.417
   No, okay, yes.

13:39.419 --> 13:41.920
If -- If we would have watched
 that movie a few months ago,

13:41.922 --> 13:44.756
 it would have been
really weird, but...

13:44.758 --> 13:46.291
 we're all good now,
        right?

13:46.293 --> 13:49.294
                 Oh, yeah.
          No, I mean, I am good.

13:49.296 --> 13:51.796
          Dylan and I picked up
        right where we left off.

13:51.798 --> 13:53.798
                 I was just
              checking on you.

13:53.800 --> 13:56.467
    'Cause for a while there,
you were getting a little, uh...

13:56.469 --> 13:58.303
       ♪ Doot-doot, do-do-do-do,
           doot-doot, do-do ♪

13:58.305 --> 14:00.104
  (chuckles) Yeah.

14:00.106 --> 14:01.773
  Beth stood by me.

14:01.775 --> 14:04.275
   Well, you know,
as close as she could.
                            Hmm.

14:04.277 --> 14:06.444
    That's when I knew
    I was with the right person.

14:06.446 --> 14:07.679
       And --
       And don't get me wrong --

14:07.681 --> 14:10.348
    I was --
    I was pretty hung up on you.

14:10.350 --> 14:11.850
                 (chuckles)

14:11.852 --> 14:13.518
 But once I got it down to
only one woman in my head,

14:13.520 --> 14:15.353
      I saw Beth
 in a whole new way,

14:15.355 --> 14:16.955
 and we were able to
    move forward.

14:16.957 --> 14:19.791
              That makes sense.

14:19.793 --> 14:21.125
             I'm happy for you.

14:23.063 --> 14:25.730
(British accent) Look at us,
     brother and sister,

14:25.732 --> 14:27.065
separated from our mum...

14:27.067 --> 14:30.068
                   Oh,
         you're so good at that.

14:30.070 --> 14:31.402
          Hey,
what do you think about

14:31.404 --> 14:34.072
inviting Haley and Dylan
     to the wedding?

14:34.074 --> 14:36.241
              I love that idea.

14:36.243 --> 14:38.476
               And I love you
               for having it.

14:39.980 --> 14:43.915
   Why do you think people
stopped saying "coinkydink"?

14:43.917 --> 14:45.416
                Dylan, um...

14:45.418 --> 14:46.851
      Oh, God.

14:46.853 --> 14:48.586
You're breaking up with me
    again, aren't you?

14:48.588 --> 14:50.755
                 I'm sorry.
               I just -- I --

14:50.757 --> 14:52.924
       I feel like Andy and Beth

14:52.926 --> 14:55.426
       and everyone in the world
          are moving forward,

14:55.428 --> 14:57.028
              and we're moving
                  backward.

14:57.030 --> 14:58.396
      Actually,
   we're stopping,

14:58.398 --> 15:00.098
  because I want to
 get out of the car.

15:00.100 --> 15:02.600
                  Dylan --
   Stop!

15:02.602 --> 15:05.603
   I'm tired of
   being jerked around.

15:05.605 --> 15:08.907
   Now I'm moving forward,
   too.

15:08.909 --> 15:10.575
             Can't you at least
                call an Uber?

15:10.577 --> 15:14.412
   You know they banned me for
talking too much to the drivers!

15:14.414 --> 15:17.081
  She's still not answering.
I can't believe we lost them.

15:17.083 --> 15:19.751
  We're almost home. I can track
   her phone from the computer.

15:19.753 --> 15:21.419
           (as Claire) "I hope
         you can track her phone

15:21.421 --> 15:22.954
         better than you tracked
                that van."

15:22.956 --> 15:25.056
        I'm sorry, Claire.
  Just 'cause I'm 1/64 Cherokee,

15:25.058 --> 15:26.724
             it doesn't make me
             a natural tracker.

15:26.726 --> 15:28.426
  You realize I'm not
participating in this.

15:28.428 --> 15:30.261
  Well, you made it pretty clear
   it was my fault we lost them

15:30.263 --> 15:32.096
                due to
     my less-than-manly driving.

15:32.098 --> 15:34.599
Oh, my God.
              Yes, this again.

15:34.601 --> 15:36.234
  I'm not letting it go till you
  admit that you wish I was a --

15:36.236 --> 15:37.335
 Phil, it's the van!

15:38.405 --> 15:39.904
              In my own house?!
  Oh, no!

15:39.906 --> 15:41.406
       (tires screeching)

15:41.408 --> 15:43.608
Okay, now, hang on.
     Don't hold me back, Claire!

15:43.610 --> 15:45.476
                  I may be
               1/64 Cherokee,

15:45.478 --> 15:49.580
             but I'm also 63/64
              crazy white guy!

15:49.582 --> 15:51.049
    Where is he?!

15:51.051 --> 15:52.216
         -Are you okay?
  -What are you talking about?

15:52.218 --> 15:53.551
          -Are you okay?
          -I-I-I'm fine.

15:53.553 --> 15:57.322
     -No, I'm sorry! I-I --
         -You are now!

15:57.324 --> 15:59.123
                  (grunts)

15:59.125 --> 16:00.058
            Reuben?

16:00.060 --> 16:01.392
     Oh, my God!

16:01.394 --> 16:03.728
  I killed Reuben!

16:03.730 --> 16:04.896
           Oh, babe?

16:04.898 --> 16:06.898
        What's going on?
         That's blood.

16:06.900 --> 16:12.070
 In my defense, I didn't think
  anyone would ever find out.

16:12.072 --> 16:13.171
Stay with me, Reuben!

16:13.173 --> 16:14.906
             Okay,
      so Reuben is the one

16:14.908 --> 16:16.307
       who picked you up
          in the van?

16:16.309 --> 16:18.743
        Yes, it was his dad's --
               Oh, my God!

16:18.745 --> 16:20.078
                  Have you
             been following me?

16:20.080 --> 16:22.246
   He's coming to.
 He's gonna be fine.

16:22.248 --> 16:23.414
       No! No!

16:23.416 --> 16:25.249
           Don't try
    and make this our fault.

16:25.251 --> 16:28.286
You are the one who went to the
liquor store and bought -- what?

16:28.288 --> 16:30.621
       Ice.

16:30.623 --> 16:34.625
   Reuben sprained his hamstring
  today while playing quidditch.

16:34.627 --> 16:36.861
  Honey, don't take this
the wrong way, but Reuben?

16:36.863 --> 16:38.429
         We're in love.
                    Oh, shut up.

16:38.431 --> 16:40.198
   No, no, no, keep talking!
     Remember what happened

16:40.200 --> 16:42.100
   when you tripped and fell
   right before we got here?

16:42.102 --> 16:43.935
               You know what?
              Caltech is hard.

16:43.937 --> 16:46.371
      Between all the geniuses
    and breaking up with Sanjay,

16:46.373 --> 16:48.206
               I just wanted
          something comfortable,

16:48.208 --> 16:50.708
    even if it is a wormy little
       dork that worships me.

16:50.710 --> 16:52.777
    Oh, honey, I understand.

16:52.779 --> 16:54.512
    Oh, like mother,
like daughter, I guess.

16:54.514 --> 16:56.180
             Okay.
      He's gonna be fine.

16:56.182 --> 16:57.849
      Phil, come over here
  and talk to me for a second.

16:57.851 --> 16:59.317
                  Oh, okay.

16:59.319 --> 17:00.952
        Well, I guess we're done
         with my thing already.

17:00.954 --> 17:03.688
  If I was ever stupid enough
   to imply, for one second,

17:03.690 --> 17:05.356
             that you were not
          bad boy enough for me,

17:05.358 --> 17:08.526
  I couldn't possibly think that
            right now.

17:08.528 --> 17:10.328
         Because
I attacked a 16-year-old?

17:10.329 --> 17:13.297
             You didn't know
         who was in that closet.

17:13.299 --> 17:14.832
  That's true.
                   Mm-hmm.

17:14.834 --> 17:16.367
                  Look, he's up.

17:16.368 --> 17:17.702
     Okay, we're gonna
     leave the two of you alone.

17:17.704 --> 17:19.369
     Oh, wait, wait, wait,
          no, no, no.

17:19.372 --> 17:22.006
     Yeah, we're not gonna
 tell anyone about this, right?

17:22.008 --> 17:25.510
       Forbidden love.
It's -- It's hotter that way.

17:25.512 --> 17:27.678
         Also,
I -- I had a-a-a wand.

17:27.680 --> 17:30.481
       Um...

17:30.483 --> 17:32.583
     I hate myself so much.

17:32.585 --> 17:34.018
               Mmm! It's good.

17:34.020 --> 17:36.421
    Of course it's good.
It's -- I'm sure -- o...kay.

17:36.423 --> 17:38.589
    Oh, my gosh.
   It's glorious.

17:38.591 --> 17:40.258
   So much better
     than mine.

17:40.260 --> 17:41.926
          Well, your sauce is --
Is garbage!

17:41.928 --> 17:43.327
                   Mm-hmm.
It's mostly ketchup.

17:43.329 --> 17:44.695
Gloria, this is
what we need to be selling

17:44.697 --> 17:45.997
at the farmers' market.

17:45.999 --> 17:47.665
We would have them lined up
clear down

17:47.667 --> 17:49.700
past the cruelty-free
beaver-milk stand.

17:49.702 --> 17:51.202
I would crush Andrew.

17:51.204 --> 17:53.771
             I cannot go back
         to the farmers' market.

17:53.773 --> 17:55.773
       The year was 2011.

17:55.775 --> 17:57.508
      I had just come back
         from Colombia

17:57.510 --> 18:01.112
with a box full of our family's
     homemade hair relaxer,

18:01.114 --> 18:03.281
    the Colombian Comb-Out.

18:03.283 --> 18:07.518
   Friday, I sold 50 bottles,
        but Saturday...

18:07.520 --> 18:11.089
   It says on the bottle to
leave it in for three minutes!

18:11.091 --> 18:14.258
                No, it says,
            "Leave in for three.

18:14.260 --> 18:16.260
             Minutes later,
       you will look fantastic."

18:16.262 --> 18:18.096
              One, two, three,
                comb it out.

18:18.098 --> 18:19.931
                <i> Ay,</i> I see how
            it can be confusing.

18:21.101 --> 18:24.102
         If it's true,
    as many people theorize,

18:24.104 --> 18:27.538
      that Stonehenge was,
   in fact, a druid closet --

18:27.540 --> 18:28.539
                  Mitchell.
     Hmm?

18:28.541 --> 18:29.974
  Uh, oh. Oh, yeah.

18:29.976 --> 18:31.976
Oh, good. We -- We got it!
              What's with you?

18:31.978 --> 18:33.578
              I'm sorry.

18:33.580 --> 18:35.580
    I'm sorry. I got this whole
    work thing stressing me out.

18:35.582 --> 18:36.914
            It's your lucky day.

18:36.916 --> 18:38.916
          You have an audience
        with a titan of industry

18:38.918 --> 18:41.652
       without having to buy
  the $15-a-plate dinner ticket.

18:41.654 --> 18:43.387
              What's the issue?

18:43.389 --> 18:47.158
  Well, I got this job offer at
this really big firm, but, um...

18:47.160 --> 18:50.161
     I've actually,
uh, been thinking about

18:50.163 --> 18:52.130
   maybe starting
  my own practice.

18:52.132 --> 18:54.298
       What's your gut tell you?
    I don't know.

18:54.300 --> 18:57.135
  I-I would like to have my own
  firm, but that's really scary.

18:57.137 --> 18:59.971
    But this other offer
    is very attractive,

18:59.973 --> 19:01.973
    but I'd have to report
    to this guy who I hate,

19:01.975 --> 19:04.075
which, you know, might be
worth it for the job security --

19:04.077 --> 19:06.110
               Take the offer.
   Really?

19:06.112 --> 19:07.445
         It takes a certain type
              of personality

19:07.447 --> 19:08.779
          to run your own thing.

19:08.781 --> 19:10.448
       You have to be a fighter.

19:10.450 --> 19:11.849
 Well, this is fun.

19:11.851 --> 19:13.084
                 You wanted
             my honest opinion.

19:13.086 --> 19:14.919
      No, Cam! I said no.

19:14.921 --> 19:18.422
The polar ice caps are melting,
   gridlock in Washington --

19:18.424 --> 19:20.925
        America needs to
    feel good again, Gloria.

19:20.927 --> 19:23.094
  -Let them taste your sauce.
     -What's happening now?

19:23.096 --> 19:26.430
He wants me to sell my sauce
   at the farmers' market,

19:26.432 --> 19:28.032
       but I am
   not interested.

19:28.034 --> 19:30.001
     -I agree with Gloria.
      -Thank you so much.

19:30.003 --> 19:31.836
    Yeah, you crashed and burned
        with the hair thing.

19:31.838 --> 19:33.337
                You need more
            of that humiliation?

19:33.339 --> 19:35.673
 We don't know that
 that would happen.

19:35.675 --> 19:37.808
   Disappearing middle class,
        racial unrest...

19:37.810 --> 19:40.178
You got a nice thing going here,
        Gloria. Enjoy it.

19:40.180 --> 19:42.180
What? You don't think
  that I can do it?

19:42.182 --> 19:43.981
      No. No, he doesn't.

19:43.983 --> 19:46.617
  He thinks that he's the only
 business titan in this family.

19:46.619 --> 19:50.621
   Nobody can tell me
what I can or cannot do.

19:50.623 --> 19:52.790
  I have some sauce
       to sell.

19:52.792 --> 19:55.826
        And I'm gonna go
register my new firm right now.

19:55.828 --> 19:57.495
And I'm gonna storm out,
          too,

19:57.497 --> 20:02.066
even though both of those things
  actually make me very happy.

20:06.573 --> 20:08.739
             (beep)

20:08.741 --> 20:10.741
        (clears throat)

20:10.743 --> 20:13.911
        You want to know
   what drove Jay Pritchett?

20:13.913 --> 20:16.380
       People telling me
     I wasn't good enough.

20:16.382 --> 20:18.049
    There's something about
      a person telling you

20:18.051 --> 20:19.383
    you can't do something.

20:19.385 --> 20:21.419
       Blood.

20:21.421 --> 20:24.488
         It just lights
    the competitive fires...

20:26.759 --> 20:28.960
 ...drives us to take risks...

20:31.598 --> 20:34.365
         ...opens us up
    to new opportunities...

20:34.367 --> 20:36.033
   Oh, hey, Sarah.

20:36.035 --> 20:37.168
      I'm sorry
   about your cat.

20:37.170 --> 20:38.436
                   I heard
              you got arrested.

20:39.339 --> 20:41.839
    Everything I did, I did
 to prove the naysayers wrong.

20:41.841 --> 20:44.342
So, to everyone who didn't think
      I was good enough --

20:44.344 --> 20:46.177
     Look, dad!
  I tied my shoes!

20:46.179 --> 20:48.012
               Good job, Joe!

20:48.014 --> 20:50.014
                   Ah.

20:50.016 --> 20:52.016
                  ...how do
              you like me now?

20:56.956 --> 20:58.422
 Honey, I don't want to
go to this Titans dinner

20:58.424 --> 20:59.757
  any more than you do,
but we're gonna be late.

20:59.759 --> 21:01.459
       Phil.

21:01.461 --> 21:03.394
     Phil. Phil!

21:03.396 --> 21:04.262
                   Dunphy.

21:04.264 --> 21:05.563
  What is going on?

21:05.565 --> 21:06.897
              I'm trying to
         pay Luke's impound fee,

21:06.899 --> 21:08.199
                 but this
          automated phone system

21:08.201 --> 21:09.533
             doesn't understand
            anything I'm saying.

21:09.535 --> 21:12.403
                  Dun-phy.

21:12.405 --> 21:14.405
               "Dun-fee." Yes.

21:14.407 --> 21:16.073
                   No! No!

21:16.075 --> 21:17.541
              Not Bill Dunphy.

21:17.543 --> 21:19.777
      We went over my first name
            for 20 minutes!

21:19.779 --> 21:22.446
                   Phil!

21:22.448 --> 21:24.448
                    Phil!

21:24.450 --> 21:26.284
                   Phil!

21:26.286 --> 21:27.551
                    Phil!

21:27.553 --> 21:28.953
         (door opens)
                      Phil!
